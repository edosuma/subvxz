WEBVTT

00:04.399 --> 00:05.517
Oh, come on, man.

00:06.363 --> 00:07.363
Get out!

00:07.702 --> 00:09.712
Let's go, buddy.
Time to go, buddy. Come on.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.886
- That's no way to treat a Marine.
- Ease up, Sergeant.

00:13.236 --> 00:15.077
- Let's go home.
- Where is my...?

00:15.382 --> 00:17.501
Hey.
I left my credit card in the bar.

00:17.928 --> 00:19.271
- Come on.
- Hey!

00:20.046 --> 00:21.710
Sarge. Get it tomorrow.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.561
There is no tomorrow, Lacombe.

00:24.862 --> 00:26.783
- I'm going around front.
- Know what?

00:26.891 --> 00:28.857
I think the sergeant
is a little drunk.

00:30.268 --> 00:32.386
But you're fine, right, Sailor?

00:46.083 --> 00:47.647
Attention, Corporal Taylor.

00:49.475 --> 00:50.476
Kevin?

00:53.714 --> 00:54.714
Kevin?

01:02.555 --> 01:03.556
Ethan!

01:06.104 --> 01:07.104
Ethan.

01:07.307 --> 01:08.901
Hang on, man. Hang on.

01:09.961 --> 01:10.961
Help!

01:11.511 --> 01:12.973
Help!

01:46.547 --> 01:48.202
None of the bar staff heard anything.

01:48.262 --> 01:50.446
Apparently,
they like their music real loud.

01:50.529 --> 01:51.726
Discourages talking.

01:51.786 --> 01:54.202
Encourages drinking and
other mouth-related activities.

01:54.437 --> 01:57.486
The camera's been disabled. Looks
like the dumpster's been moved, too.

01:57.824 --> 01:59.963
Yeah. Hiding place.
Already thought about it.

02:06.296 --> 02:07.911
Mozart and Mayhem.

02:08.042 --> 02:10.122
A little early for formal attire?

02:10.245 --> 02:11.071
Really?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.166
I'd say late.
Looks like Ducky got lucky.

02:13.451 --> 02:15.224
You've never heard
of a night at the opera?

02:15.284 --> 02:16.004
Sure.

02:16.084 --> 02:17.826
Groucho as Otis P. Driftwood.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.736
Marx Brothers at their most hilarious.

02:19.796 --> 02:21.725
Love the part where
they rip up the contract.

02:21.785 --> 02:24.288
"That's no good-a for you.
It's no good-a for me."

02:28.815 --> 02:31.449
Single blunt-force trauma
to the sternum.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.353
At least one broken rib.

02:33.434 --> 02:36.246
Ziva, I'm gonna need you
to bag some wood chips for me.

02:36.312 --> 02:39.194
It could be a baseball bat.
Major league ass-kicking.

02:39.349 --> 02:42.735
EMTs declared Taylor dead
at the scene a little after 3:00 A.M.

02:42.837 --> 02:44.032
How's the other fella?

02:44.092 --> 02:47.264
Corporal Ethan Lacombe,
rushed to the hospital.

02:47.366 --> 02:49.343
Multiple fractures, internal bleeding.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.522
They're prepping him
for brain surgery right now.

02:51.718 --> 02:53.382
How ironic.

02:53.537 --> 02:56.186
Lacombe manages to survive
a vicious attack,

02:56.246 --> 02:58.651
while you have the bad luck to die

02:58.810 --> 03:01.097
from what appears to be a single blow.

03:01.606 --> 03:04.616
- Three of you were together?
- I ran inside to get my card.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.220
I left him.

03:06.501 --> 03:08.462
There's no way you could've known,
Sergeant.

03:08.569 --> 03:09.619
I should have.

03:10.376 --> 03:12.534
I'm supposed to know
everything about them.

03:12.673 --> 03:14.080
What about Corporal Lacombe?

03:14.667 --> 03:16.864
Ethan. Funny as all hell.

03:17.207 --> 03:19.643
Throws a baseball that'll sting
your hand for a week.

03:20.506 --> 03:22.427
But other than that,
Ethan's a mystery.

03:22.748 --> 03:24.823
- Hometown?
- Never wanted to talk about it.

03:25.108 --> 03:26.950
Wears a class ring on his right hand.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.120
His eyes would glaze over, and
he'd just start twisting that thing.

03:31.615 --> 03:33.132
Sand would get under it,

03:33.491 --> 03:35.887
rub his finger raw.
He never took that thing off.

03:36.247 --> 03:37.851
I didn't press him, you know?

03:37.911 --> 03:39.644
But he's hiding something back there.

03:41.376 --> 03:43.970
Why don't you go get yourself
to a hospital, Marine.

03:44.221 --> 03:45.231
Yes, sir.

03:48.284 --> 03:49.887
Camera on the alleyway, boss.

03:50.135 --> 03:53.480
Been KO'd. Time stamp puts it about
a half hour before the fight.

03:56.698 --> 04:00.019
This wasn't a bar brawl, McGee.
This was an ambush.

04:07.863 --> 04:09.670
That was pristine.

04:09.977 --> 04:11.806
Would you like us
to put them on the floor?

04:11.867 --> 04:14.674
No, no. That's what it's for,
swabbing the deck,

04:14.734 --> 04:17.317
clearing the runway,
ready for takeoff.

04:17.414 --> 04:18.894
Garbage in, garbage out.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.351
Tidy on the outside
makes tidy on the inside.

04:21.648 --> 04:23.074
Feng shui and the gray matter.

04:23.737 --> 04:25.975
And now, to make sense of the chaos.

04:26.540 --> 04:30.263
Cigarette butts, food wrapper...
What is that, cheese?

04:30.332 --> 04:32.532
Recovered from the alleyway
where the attack took place.

04:32.595 --> 04:34.911
Other one's personal effects.
What the corporals had on them.

04:34.935 --> 04:37.310
Might want to start with Lacombe.
Least he's still alive.

04:37.563 --> 04:40.402
- There's blood on his ring, it's bent.
- It's from impact.

04:40.687 --> 04:41.974
Got a few punches in.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.489
Might give us DNA.

04:45.363 --> 04:47.030
Might give us more than that.

04:48.349 --> 04:49.887
Stillwater High School.

04:51.371 --> 04:54.203
- That supposed to mean something to us?
- Stillwater...

04:54.546 --> 04:55.559
High School.

04:56.119 --> 04:58.639
In all that time that you two
spend staring at computer screens,

04:58.684 --> 05:01.215
you never once peeked in the man's file?
Come on!

05:02.188 --> 05:03.188
Whose file?

05:03.264 --> 05:06.313
Stillwater is a small town
in Pennsylvania coal country.

05:07.091 --> 05:08.883
Primarily known for the mine,

05:09.566 --> 05:12.005
but only slightly less well known
as the birthplace

05:12.065 --> 05:14.555
of one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

05:17.797 --> 05:19.787
This guy is from Gibbs' hometown.

05:27.797 --> 05:29.863
Corporal LaCombe's medical report.

05:29.949 --> 05:33.771
Surgeon performed a craniotomy on his
frontal lobe to relieve the pressure.

05:34.047 --> 05:36.815
- He'll survive?
- Well, they're cautiously optimistic.

05:36.884 --> 05:39.231
Right now,
he's in a drug-induced coma

05:39.558 --> 05:41.518
until the swelling subsides.

05:41.620 --> 05:44.389
This is more than you
can say for his friend here.

05:44.466 --> 05:45.735
Corporal Taylor.

05:45.993 --> 05:48.408
- Cause of death?
- It's a bit of an oddity.

05:48.587 --> 05:51.938
Single blunt-force trauma,
but he had a prior injury,

05:52.139 --> 05:54.538
a fractured vertebrosternal rib.

05:54.758 --> 05:56.950
It was re-fractured by the blow.

05:57.033 --> 06:00.558
The point of the rib
went through his pericardium

06:00.740 --> 06:04.740
and penetrated his left ventricle,
causing him to bleed to death.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.712
- A result of the beating.
- Yes.

06:06.854 --> 06:10.050
But his wasn't nearly as
severe as that taken by Lacombe.

06:10.272 --> 06:12.402
In addition to his skull fracture,
Lacombe had

06:12.506 --> 06:15.566
thoracic spine fractures
from multiple blunt-force traumas,

06:15.834 --> 06:17.763
left-side pneumothorax that's

06:17.827 --> 06:20.006
collapsed lung.
And a ruptured spleen.

06:20.402 --> 06:24.373
I mean, without encroaching on your
territory, Jethro, might I suggest...

06:24.433 --> 06:26.196
That the dead guy was a dead end.

06:26.393 --> 06:28.434
- Lacombe was the target.
- Yeah.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.505
Any idea why?

06:30.802 --> 06:32.287
I just started looking, Duck.

06:32.644 --> 06:34.688
I've heard whispers that your search

06:34.798 --> 06:37.496
might take you to Stillwater,
Pennsylvania.

06:38.563 --> 06:39.564
It may.

06:40.155 --> 06:41.991
Digging into a man's past,

06:42.301 --> 06:44.373
no telling what it might unearth.

06:45.679 --> 06:47.085
So many questions.

06:47.422 --> 06:50.669
My mind is spinning with questions.

06:50.949 --> 06:52.610
I mean,
have you ever thought about it?

06:52.698 --> 06:55.258
He actually came from somewhere.
He didn't just appear, you know.

06:55.308 --> 06:57.489
He didn't just start Gibbs.
He was a boy.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.322
- And then he grew.
- I thought he was molded from clay,

07:00.538 --> 07:03.013
had life breathed into him
by a group of mystics.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.956
That's funny, I thought he fell
to Earth in a capsule

07:06.038 --> 07:07.900
after his home planet exploded.

07:08.103 --> 07:11.806
No, he burst forth full-grown
from the mind of Zeus.

07:12.331 --> 07:13.089
Nice.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.925
He is the avatar of Vishnu.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.677
He was sent to be
the left hand of Yahweh.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.609
He was grown in a cabbage patch.

07:19.786 --> 07:22.281
I'm trying to pose a serious
metaphysical question here.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.740
You want to be clever?
I can be clever.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.476
Just a matter of time, DiNozzo.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.758
Tracing the moves of Lacombe
and Taylor's squad, boss.

07:28.818 --> 07:31.525
They returned from Iraq three weeks ago,
arrived at Lejeune.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.046
No outgoing e-mails,
no telephone calls, no visitors.

07:34.148 --> 07:35.148
Lacombe?

07:35.208 --> 07:38.209
Just, one aunt on the mother's side:
Janet Lacombe.

07:38.515 --> 07:40.852
Lives in Stillwater, Pennsylvania.

07:43.113 --> 07:44.282
So I've heard.

07:44.418 --> 07:47.805
Abby lifted traces of anthracite off
one of the splinters we recovered.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.633
It's like coal dust,
like you find in a coal mine.

07:52.725 --> 07:54.804
- Road trip.
- DiNozzo.

07:55.056 --> 07:57.709
- On your six, boss.
- Follow up with the Taylor family.

07:58.975 --> 08:00.242
But I...

08:01.027 --> 08:02.027
On it.

08:04.209 --> 08:05.222
Hate you.

08:06.287 --> 08:07.715
Take lots of pictures.

08:08.728 --> 08:11.528
- Printed out directions, boss.
- Yeah, I know how to get there, McGee.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.858
So when was the last time
you went home?

08:14.918 --> 08:16.819
I make it a point
to go home every night.

08:17.140 --> 08:20.170
Well, I mean, when was
the last time you went to Stillwater?

08:21.482 --> 08:23.027
I'd just joined the Corps.

08:25.396 --> 08:27.158
Summer 76.

08:27.876 --> 08:29.583
What was it like when you left?

08:31.199 --> 08:32.722
Whole lot of fanfare.

08:33.116 --> 08:35.278
Fireworks, parades...

08:38.187 --> 08:40.107
Might have been the bicentennial.

08:58.451 --> 09:00.510
Well, that didn't take long.

09:06.741 --> 09:09.454
You know, if you had
a little tennis ball buzz cut

09:09.514 --> 09:11.945
instead of that salt and pepper,
you'd remind me

09:12.005 --> 09:15.312
of this skinny little wise-ass
I used to know.

09:16.424 --> 09:18.131
Why didn't you tell me you was coming?

09:18.397 --> 09:19.857
Not sure it's worth your trouble.

09:21.115 --> 09:22.798
Heard you was a Fed now.

09:23.788 --> 09:26.580
Never imagined we'd end up
on the same side, huh?

09:27.874 --> 09:29.967
No. No, never.

09:31.848 --> 09:34.621
- How've you been, Ed?
- After 30 years?

09:35.183 --> 09:36.631
Well, let's see...

09:37.373 --> 09:38.839
Remember Debbie Leonard?

09:39.248 --> 09:40.357
Knocked her up.

09:40.941 --> 09:42.961
Married, kids.

09:43.478 --> 09:46.092
My kid had a kid, calls me Pappy.

09:46.580 --> 09:47.828
You know how it goes.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.466
Anything I can help you with?

09:51.840 --> 09:53.656
Far as the police work goes.

09:54.053 --> 09:55.403
I'll let you know.

09:55.978 --> 09:57.444
You do that, Leroy.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.521
Old friend?

10:12.044 --> 10:13.189
Check with DiNozzo.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.108
Find out how LaCombe's doing.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.880
Boss, there a reason
you didn't call ahead?

10:19.116 --> 10:20.433
Of course there is.

10:20.493 --> 10:23.715
If someone around here had a grudge
to settle with Ethan Lacombe,

10:23.775 --> 10:25.478
why let them know we're coming?

10:29.466 --> 10:30.619
Janet Lacombe?

10:31.742 --> 10:32.742
Yes.

10:32.829 --> 10:35.417
- We need to talk about your nephew.
- About Ethan?

10:35.684 --> 10:37.831
- He's dead.
- No, Miss Lacombe.

10:37.891 --> 10:41.016
We didn't mean to give you that
impression. Ethan is still alive.

10:41.344 --> 10:44.011
He was badly injured in an attack.

10:44.071 --> 10:46.313
He's in a hospital
in Virginia currently.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.114
Ethan's in a hospital?

10:49.511 --> 10:50.699
Oh my Lord.

10:51.253 --> 10:52.809
I can't believe it.

10:53.716 --> 10:55.604
I thought he died four years ago.

10:56.460 --> 10:58.049
Ethan's alive!

11:00.418 --> 11:02.359
Afraid you're not going
to have much luck.

11:02.546 --> 11:05.161
Occasionally, when the wind is right,
you can get a signal.

11:05.478 --> 11:06.478
Thank you.

11:07.443 --> 11:09.691
Is there a public phone
around here I could use?

11:09.821 --> 11:11.098
There's one in my store.

11:11.349 --> 11:12.626
My name's Jackson.

11:15.777 --> 11:18.074
Well, Ziva,
it looks like you dropped something.

11:22.231 --> 11:24.381
Kind of tells a story, doesn't it?

11:24.713 --> 11:27.123
A $20 bill in your wallet
is just a piece of paper.

11:27.278 --> 11:30.684
You put it on the ground and,
suddenly, it's full of wonder.

11:31.147 --> 11:33.306
Context can change a thing.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.591
That it can.

11:36.417 --> 11:39.120
For instance, I'll bet, back in...
Israel,

11:39.724 --> 11:41.526
you were considered a pretty girl.

11:42.455 --> 11:44.346
You step one foot in my country

11:44.657 --> 11:47.207
and, instantly,
you're an exotic beauty.

11:47.736 --> 11:49.840
When did we start talking about people?

11:49.900 --> 11:53.592
Well, if the "I" in NCIS
is to be believed,

11:54.030 --> 11:57.412
you're observant enough
to realize that all this is a pretext

11:57.697 --> 12:00.123
for engaging a young woman
in conversation.

12:01.055 --> 12:04.286
We need to ask you a few more questions
before you head to the hospital.

12:04.366 --> 12:05.703
I'm sorry. I'm just...

12:06.550 --> 12:08.093
Ethan. His mom.

12:08.341 --> 12:10.933
My sister. She was a wild child.

12:11.309 --> 12:13.630
- We knew she'd die young.
- Where was his father?

12:13.974 --> 12:17.686
Who was his father? Not exactly easy
to narrow it down, if you get my drift.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.145
Boy took after his mother regardless.

12:20.265 --> 12:22.023
Got into all sorts of trouble.

12:22.204 --> 12:25.517
- What kind of trouble?
- Got in some fights, stole a car.

12:25.772 --> 12:27.095
Did some time for that.

12:27.197 --> 12:29.098
Blew out of here not
too long after he got out.

12:29.237 --> 12:30.405
He have any enemies?

12:31.021 --> 12:33.618
From around here?
Don't you get it?

12:33.956 --> 12:35.857
The whole town thought he was dead.

12:41.123 --> 12:43.483
Boss, you think maybe we've taken
something of a wrong turn?

12:43.540 --> 12:45.774
Everyone in town thought
he was dead already.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.257
Maybe he wanted it that way.

12:55.021 --> 12:56.389
Word travels fast.

12:56.829 --> 12:57.878
That it does.

12:58.972 --> 13:02.081
When people actually open their mouths
and speak with one another.

13:02.985 --> 13:05.276
You don't call. You don't write.

13:07.379 --> 13:09.270
Were you going to come by and say hi?

13:11.295 --> 13:12.295
Hi...

13:12.919 --> 13:13.919
Jack.

13:14.939 --> 13:15.939
Hi...

13:17.157 --> 13:18.157
Leroy.

13:26.003 --> 13:27.230
Jackson Gibbs.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.902
My father.

13:45.234 --> 13:47.582
This is a pretty nice setup
you got here, Mr. Gibbs.

13:47.849 --> 13:48.673
Jack.

13:48.839 --> 13:51.275
You got to stay up with technology,
Tim.

13:51.365 --> 13:54.222
Otherwise,
you concede to time inch by inch.

13:54.981 --> 13:56.803
Not that it's worth the while.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.025
- Is this Nepal?
- Yeah.

13:59.289 --> 14:01.338
It was my 60th birthday,

14:01.398 --> 14:03.824
and I climbed 13,000 feet.

14:04.066 --> 14:06.452
I thought I'd give myself
a victory cigar,

14:06.512 --> 14:09.227
forgetting how thin the air was,
and I passed out.

14:09.702 --> 14:12.147
Next thing I know,
a Sherpa was giving me mouth-to-mouth.

14:12.806 --> 14:14.523
But I always make it a point

14:14.608 --> 14:17.311
to return home after every adventure,

14:18.311 --> 14:20.093
unlike some people I know.

14:21.642 --> 14:24.192
Does he ever talk about me,
my boy?

14:24.252 --> 14:26.351
I think I heard him
refer to you once as dead.

14:28.792 --> 14:31.247
You probably misheard him,
McGee.

14:31.456 --> 14:35.029
Think she's right.
I think he probably said "Dad".

14:35.203 --> 14:36.203
Well...

14:38.300 --> 14:42.038
Hey, what... what's the story on that
picture there? That looks interesting.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.810
It's the grand opening of the store.

14:43.870 --> 14:47.544
Me and LJ opened it after
too many close calls in the mines.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.953
- LJ?
- LJ. Leroy Jethro.

14:57.933 --> 15:00.547
Is that the...
gun you learned to shoot with?

15:00.672 --> 15:03.037
No one was ever allowed
to touch that Winchester.

15:03.157 --> 15:05.475
Yeah,
let that be a lesson in parenting.

15:05.658 --> 15:08.694
Tell a kid he can't have a rifle and
he grows up to be a sniper.

15:10.412 --> 15:13.720
- Can I get you something to eat, Leroy?
- Can't. Case.

15:14.615 --> 15:16.675
Well, least I can help you with that.

15:17.024 --> 15:18.885
I had a few beers with Ethan Lacombe.

15:19.439 --> 15:21.298
Gee, I'm shocked.

15:21.713 --> 15:25.694
Leroy could never see the benefit
of keeping a six-pack on ice.

15:26.337 --> 15:30.239
He'd spend all his time out
in the garage working on some project.

15:30.343 --> 15:33.174
We didn't even have
electricity out there.

15:33.647 --> 15:34.649
I can see it.

15:34.744 --> 15:38.689
One day, he blew all his money on some
wreck that he picked up at a junkyard.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.102
He was going to rebuild it
from the spark plugs up.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.858
- Never did get it running.
- And where do you keep her?

15:45.372 --> 15:47.579
I can't hang on to every piece of junk.

15:47.639 --> 15:49.395
No, just your junk.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.486
- What were we talking about?
- Ethan.

15:55.131 --> 15:58.399
Ethan, yeah, yeah.
Good kid. Little reckless.

15:58.872 --> 16:00.238
Most people liked him.

16:00.357 --> 16:02.506
- Except Winslow up there.
- Chuck Winslow?

16:02.585 --> 16:03.942
Yeah, your old buddy.

16:04.002 --> 16:07.035
- Owns the Winslow Mining Company?
- That's the one.

16:07.346 --> 16:10.792
Ethan had a kind of a thing
for his daughter Emily.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.500
She married Nick Kingston.

16:13.893 --> 16:16.110
That was before Ethan
took off for greener pastures.

16:16.201 --> 16:17.428
Now, where are you going?

16:17.488 --> 16:20.178
You're not going to walk up there
and start accusing people, are you?

16:20.202 --> 16:21.542
I thought I'd drive.

16:26.058 --> 16:28.316
Now, don't go doing anything stupid.

16:59.580 --> 17:02.498
If you're dead set on going
another round with Chuck Winslow,

17:03.011 --> 17:04.594
this is the least you can do.

17:04.813 --> 17:08.021
You'd be amazed what you
can get done with a kind word.

17:09.372 --> 17:10.402
I'll show you.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.955
Boss, we'll... wait here.

17:29.067 --> 17:30.968
- I'll call Tony.
- I'll call Abby.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.239
What do you got, Abs?

17:36.299 --> 17:39.198
I found three distinct blood samples
on LaCombe's ring.

17:39.459 --> 17:43.083
One sample belongs to Lacombe,
but he definitely got some punches in.

17:43.302 --> 17:46.352
If we're really lucky,
our bad guys have some marks on them.

17:46.505 --> 17:49.485
- You heard anything?
- From Hazzard County? No, not yet.

17:51.124 --> 17:53.484
Look, Bo.
There's our good ol'boy.

17:53.544 --> 17:54.836
- I got 'em.
- Hey, Luke.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.246
How's Uncle Jesse?

17:56.453 --> 17:58.833
- Gibbs has a father.
- Tell me everything.

17:58.955 --> 18:01.804
His name is Jackson. He's a good talker.
He may have winked at me.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.739
Gibbs is very different around him.

18:03.835 --> 18:06.596
- Different how? Bad? Different good?
- He's like a teenager, sort of.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.438
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm going. I'm leaving.

18:08.498 --> 18:10.196
- Me, too.
- No, you can't,

18:10.256 --> 18:12.456
not unless you found a way
the people in town might have

18:12.509 --> 18:14.346
thought Ethan Lacombe was alive.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.477
- They thought he was dead?
- Wait, I have that.

18:17.781 --> 18:19.068
I wrote that down.

18:19.311 --> 18:20.688
Hang on, I found it.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.358
Here.
See, look, that's a video link.

18:23.974 --> 18:25.835
Type that in and, and...

18:26.195 --> 18:27.801
Yeah, there. There it is.

18:27.962 --> 18:29.839
- You see him?
- This is from Iraq?

18:29.902 --> 18:31.088
Yeah, that's him.

18:31.148 --> 18:32.933
Lacombe was tagged
in the video's content.

18:32.993 --> 18:34.616
Just posted before his squad came home.

18:34.676 --> 18:36.443
I'm impressed with your Internet savvy.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.569
- How'd you find that?
- I used Google.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.214
Not so impressive, Gibbs
probably could have done that.

18:41.304 --> 18:42.954
- What?
- Where is Gibbs?

18:45.690 --> 18:47.571
Haven't you forgotten something?

18:55.731 --> 18:57.734
- How you doing, Nick?
- Hey, Jack.

18:57.896 --> 19:01.164
This is my son Leroy,
an old friend of your father-in-law's.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.670
No, come on in, Leroy.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.440
Did I hear someone say Leroy?

19:05.755 --> 19:06.844
Stop the presses.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.319
Got a new headline.

19:08.839 --> 19:10.372
Local boy makes good.

19:10.768 --> 19:13.904
- Not as good as you, Chuck.
- That's kind of you to say.

19:14.141 --> 19:15.695
Just hard work and sweat...

19:15.815 --> 19:17.182
mostly other peoples'.

19:17.954 --> 19:20.090
Sit. Let's crack this bottle.

19:21.352 --> 19:24.823
- Emily, let me help you with that.
- That's woman's work, Jack.

19:25.256 --> 19:26.585
Take a load off.

19:27.101 --> 19:28.918
Bring us some glasses,
would you, sweetheart?

19:28.978 --> 19:29.978
Sure, Daddy.

19:32.849 --> 19:35.601
Home is the sailor,
home from the sea.

19:36.124 --> 19:37.226
So the poem goes.

19:37.345 --> 19:39.959
No offense. I know you're
a Marine through to the bone.

19:40.671 --> 19:43.027
- What brings you back?
- Another Marine.

19:43.106 --> 19:44.237
Ethan Lacombe.

19:47.260 --> 19:49.378
Must be a night for raising the dead.

19:50.418 --> 19:52.794
Haven't heard that boy's name in years.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.171
He's not dead.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.420
Really?

19:56.480 --> 19:59.484
Well, rumor was,
he drowned in, in Alaska.

20:01.494 --> 20:03.219
- What was it, hon?
- Fishing.

20:04.219 --> 20:05.518
He had that

20:05.707 --> 20:08.437
mean streak in him.
What do you call it?

20:08.547 --> 20:10.531
Thrill-seeker, death wish?

20:11.652 --> 20:15.078
Just shows to go you can't
always get what you want.

20:16.806 --> 20:20.594
Leroy is just doing some background
research, all very standard.

20:21.173 --> 20:24.361
NCIS insists you,
you beat all the bushes.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.075
Particularly with murder.

20:26.287 --> 20:27.287
Murder?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.852
- You said the boy was alive.
- Yeah, he is.

20:30.081 --> 20:32.576
His friend isn't.
We're still looking for a motive.

20:34.218 --> 20:37.827
Well, we, we haven't seen
Ethan since he lit out of here...

20:38.398 --> 20:40.160
What was it then? Six years ago?

20:41.392 --> 20:43.592
You know, he tried to run off
with my girl.

20:44.614 --> 20:46.594
But she came to her senses.

20:47.838 --> 20:51.006
No, Ethan was the wrong
boy for my daughter.

20:52.096 --> 20:53.713
She chose the right man.

20:56.061 --> 20:58.094
So what kind of clues you following,
Sherlock?

20:58.377 --> 20:59.377
Blood.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.511
Attackers left traces on his ring.

21:02.596 --> 21:03.596
His ring?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.230
Yeah.

21:05.392 --> 21:06.422
Class ring.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.467
Just like that.

21:09.473 --> 21:12.286
That's odd.
Ethan never graduated high school.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.074
This isn't exactly the kind

21:14.134 --> 21:16.811
of after-dinner conversation
I expected, Chuck.

21:19.442 --> 21:21.708
I'm interested.
Tell me about the blood.

21:21.828 --> 21:23.772
Well, it can be used
to convict a suspect.

21:23.969 --> 21:25.949
Or rule somebody out, of course.

21:27.075 --> 21:30.164
And you got a reason to believe
there's a suspect around here?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.455
Not yet.

21:32.300 --> 21:33.726
Daddy, Daddy.

21:34.552 --> 21:37.324
Hey, there, buddy.
This is my son Chris.

21:37.384 --> 21:39.186
Chris, you're getting awful big.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.874
- How old are you now?
- He's, he's five.

21:42.712 --> 21:45.305
- Five and three-quarters.
- That's right, big guy.

21:51.325 --> 21:53.325
- Thanks for the drink.
- Come here, sweetie.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.401
Chuck.

22:01.451 --> 22:03.728
Everybody's always
lying to you all the time.

22:04.193 --> 22:06.387
Can't you ever take
things as you see 'em?

22:06.464 --> 22:08.373
I see people lying to me.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.916
You were such a happy child.

22:11.302 --> 22:13.463
- Boss, I talked to Tony and Abby.
- Boss?

22:14.032 --> 22:15.794
You make them call you that?

22:16.536 --> 22:17.784
He's not a...

22:18.861 --> 22:20.349
Are you a boss, Leroy?

22:20.872 --> 22:24.624
Blood traces from LaCombe's ring
will help us ID two of his attackers.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.308
As far as how they found him,

22:26.389 --> 22:29.568
LaCombe's squad in Iraq
made a video and put it on the Net.

22:30.363 --> 22:34.125
It was posted a month ago, and
already has almost half million hits.

22:34.375 --> 22:37.548
It's a lot of data to sift through,
but I can tell who's seen it.

22:37.722 --> 22:39.003
You can do that?

22:39.439 --> 22:41.608
You can tell everything
I've been looking at?

22:41.891 --> 22:43.698
What have you been looking at?

22:44.121 --> 22:45.410
None of your business.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.960
See, using, service-provider accounts,
I can cross-reference the static IPs...

22:51.875 --> 22:52.876
I'm tired.

22:53.108 --> 22:54.662
I can conclusively say

22:54.755 --> 22:57.369
that this video has been viewed
from the Winslows' home account.

22:57.468 --> 23:00.362
Someone in that house knew
Ethan Lacombe was still alive.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.037
You see anybody could have found that.

23:02.097 --> 23:04.052
I mean, anybody could have
known how to find him.

23:04.112 --> 23:05.637
It could have been anyone.

23:06.022 --> 23:07.892
But they lied to me about it.

23:40.149 --> 23:42.090
Yeah. It's good coffee.

23:46.385 --> 23:47.677
Yeah, I know.

23:50.066 --> 23:51.715
Morning, Gibbs.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.959
Gibbses.

23:56.234 --> 23:59.244
Corporal Lacombe briefly
regained consciousness, but,

24:00.239 --> 24:02.100
he has no memory of the attack.

24:03.419 --> 24:06.381
Tony's trying to secure a court order
for the Winslow family.

24:06.644 --> 24:09.377
To take blood samples,
financial records.

24:09.516 --> 24:12.522
- Who is this Tony?
- He will be driving up this afternoon.

24:12.638 --> 24:16.638
So, how's it go? You line up people you
don't like and make 'em give you blood?

24:16.840 --> 24:19.043
- It's not personal.
- Sure, it is.

24:19.353 --> 24:22.542
One of those guys put that kid
in the hospital, killed his friend.

24:22.642 --> 24:25.199
- Yeah, and you know this how?
- I can feel it.

24:25.587 --> 24:28.396
Feelings.
That sounds very personal to me.

24:28.456 --> 24:30.456
I do this for a living.

24:30.601 --> 24:31.646
Some living.

24:31.749 --> 24:34.191
Just to let you feel
superior to everybody else.

24:34.313 --> 24:35.903
What do you want me to do?

24:36.741 --> 24:38.863
Why do you say you think
they're responsible?

24:39.115 --> 24:41.214
How about getting
some more evidence first?

24:41.323 --> 24:42.471
How about that?

24:42.794 --> 24:44.259
How about DNA?

24:44.488 --> 24:46.508
I thought everything was DNA now.

24:57.026 --> 24:59.355
It's a shame.
I was really starting to like him.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.415
Me, too.

25:00.654 --> 25:03.703
And Gibbs sure is bending
over backwards to accommodate him.

25:03.785 --> 25:05.508
He needs to be himself.

25:07.932 --> 25:11.231
- Can I help you folks?
- Sure you want to make that offer?

25:11.519 --> 25:14.648
- Depends on what you're looking for.
- Anything that may carry traces of DNA.

25:14.868 --> 25:17.800
This dumpster
is on a public access road,

25:18.025 --> 25:19.860
- so we are able...
- And willing.

25:19.925 --> 25:21.193
To go through it.

25:21.972 --> 25:24.111
Looking for treasures like...

25:24.436 --> 25:25.436
this.

25:26.616 --> 25:28.130
Does that bother you?

25:28.658 --> 25:30.873
Yeah, it's a...
It's a little off-putting.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.526
Here. Let me help.

25:42.324 --> 25:45.594
I appreciate you making an effort
not to tear the town apart.

25:46.992 --> 25:49.392
You give people a chance,
they might surprise you.

25:50.001 --> 25:51.651
That's what worries me.

25:52.026 --> 25:54.799
Tell me about
this investigator thing of yours.

25:54.918 --> 25:56.609
We haven't talked since you started it.

25:56.909 --> 25:58.215
It's $1,75.

25:58.798 --> 26:02.250
In fact, we haven't talked
since the funeral.

26:03.611 --> 26:05.391
I adored that wife of yours.

26:08.273 --> 26:10.134
And I adored that child, too.

26:12.776 --> 26:15.697
Always figured it was Shannon
that sent me the Christmas cards.

26:19.872 --> 26:21.417
Well, it's like what you do.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.462
What, selling groceries?

26:24.138 --> 26:25.138
No.

26:26.443 --> 26:28.031
You like to tell a story.

26:29.524 --> 26:31.583
Well, I've been known
to spin a yarn or two.

26:31.734 --> 26:33.813
Yeah, most of mine
start with a dead body.

26:34.769 --> 26:37.529
You look into how they got that way,
they come back to life.

26:38.540 --> 26:39.710
Two and a quarter.

26:40.356 --> 26:43.263
Meet the people they knew.
You see what they try to show you.

26:44.011 --> 26:45.753
You read what they try to hide.

26:47.246 --> 26:49.371
People come in here all the time.

26:49.865 --> 26:52.177
Tell me their life stories
at the drop of a hat.

26:52.649 --> 26:54.757
- What are they trying to hide?
- Insecurity.

26:57.523 --> 27:00.077
Need assurance their life
means something.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.707
Leroy...

27:03.748 --> 27:06.818
what did I do at the funeral?

27:07.072 --> 27:09.196
You mean,
other than showing up with a date?

27:14.415 --> 27:18.059
I always thought that your mom
and I had a love story for the ages.

27:18.447 --> 27:20.427
I never regretted giving up the skies,

27:20.655 --> 27:23.160
working underground
every day in the mines.

27:23.315 --> 27:26.405
I wanted to give you that white,
picket-fence dream.

27:26.475 --> 27:27.549
And you did.

27:28.920 --> 27:29.920
But you see...

27:31.979 --> 27:35.108
things did not work out
between your mom and me.

27:36.536 --> 27:39.387
When she died,
I know how mad that made you.

27:41.152 --> 27:44.334
I know how you hated me
for getting on with my life.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.595
I saw the look in your face.

27:47.135 --> 27:48.877
How you wanted vengeance.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.288
And that look went away
when you met Shannon,

27:54.427 --> 27:56.704
but it came back quick after they died.

27:59.255 --> 28:00.819
I knew what that meant.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.336
You were gonna find
someone to take it out on.

28:06.373 --> 28:07.860
Didn't matter what I said.

28:10.205 --> 28:11.235
It never did.

28:15.470 --> 28:16.720
What do you see now?

28:20.005 --> 28:21.858
Chuck. Ed.

28:21.976 --> 28:25.343
I've got some complaints to register
on behalf of my employees.

28:25.505 --> 28:27.436
You've been sifting through their trash.

28:28.139 --> 28:30.565
I told you to come to me
if you needed anything.

28:31.366 --> 28:33.346
You did. I will.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.928
Be civilized, Leroy.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.632
You ask me,
I think this is about a grudge.

28:39.809 --> 28:42.657
I got Ethan LaCombe's
juvenile record unsealed.

28:42.812 --> 28:44.951
That car he stole belonged to you.

28:46.231 --> 28:49.043
The arrest report
was written by Ed here.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.519
You made sure he did time.

28:52.571 --> 28:54.630
We are law-abiding citizens.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.444
I can't tolerate
that kind of behavior.

28:57.598 --> 28:59.208
You just couldn't get rid of him.

28:59.431 --> 29:02.679
You want to settle the score?
Why don't we handle it like men?

29:04.384 --> 29:06.364
I know how you two handle things.

29:11.175 --> 29:12.435
Get off him!

29:13.661 --> 29:15.071
Get off of me!

29:16.949 --> 29:18.102
Hold him, Ed.

29:20.834 --> 29:22.022
That's enough!

29:23.123 --> 29:25.566
Next time, when your daddy's not around,
I'm gonna kill you.

29:25.664 --> 29:28.416
Next time, when your buddy's not around,
Chuck, I'm gonna kill you.

29:32.916 --> 29:34.857
Sure you want to pick this fight?

29:35.282 --> 29:36.673
Wasn't my choice.

30:00.187 --> 30:02.997
- You feel that?
- What? Week-old bananas?

30:03.364 --> 30:05.667
No. We are being watched.

30:13.554 --> 30:14.920
How do you do that?

30:15.008 --> 30:16.968
Hi. You must be Emily.

30:17.742 --> 30:19.227
You're with Agent Gibbs.

30:20.213 --> 30:22.035
Here about... Ethan.

30:22.204 --> 30:23.204
You know him?

30:23.264 --> 30:24.292
We were very...

30:24.908 --> 30:25.908
close...

30:26.663 --> 30:27.791
before he left.

30:27.973 --> 30:30.528
Those feelings
do not go away overnight.

30:31.238 --> 30:32.426
No. They don't.

30:34.547 --> 30:37.678
- I found him on the Internet.
- The video of his squad?

30:38.324 --> 30:40.992
- You never believed he was dead?
- I didn't want to.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.441
But I was starting to...

30:45.410 --> 30:48.567
I just wanted to talk to him again.
I made some calls.

30:51.612 --> 30:54.114
- He was my best friend.
- Is that all?

30:54.882 --> 30:55.882
Yes.

30:58.322 --> 30:59.688
Emily, who knew?

31:07.853 --> 31:09.809
You want to get off my property?

31:12.603 --> 31:14.891
- Are we finished here, McGee?
- Finished.

31:16.090 --> 31:17.090
Okay.

31:19.407 --> 31:21.547
Well, boss,
we got a load of garbage in the car.

31:21.607 --> 31:24.380
I'm sure Abby will have
a field day sifting through it for...

31:24.858 --> 31:25.858
DNA.

31:28.524 --> 31:31.001
And we found out who saw the video.
It was Emily.

31:31.279 --> 31:32.888
There a reason you're not on the road?

31:32.948 --> 31:35.949
Listen, boss, I understand that
you're treating this case differently.

31:36.070 --> 31:38.076
Some might say with kid gloves.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.729
But not me. I wouldn't say that.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.701
Boss, you're gonna start busting
in doors at some point, right?

31:43.725 --> 31:46.344
Dragging people out in handcuffs.
Tossing 'em in a room,

31:46.404 --> 31:48.888
lean one 'em till they break.
Personally, I think it works for you.

31:48.912 --> 31:51.120
Yesterday you thought
I'd made a wrong turn.

31:51.387 --> 31:54.116
- Well, that was yesterday.
- Today I'm not moving fast enough.

31:54.276 --> 31:55.344
I didn't mean to...

31:55.404 --> 31:57.918
Want to front load complaints
for tomorrow, McGee, or

31:57.987 --> 31:59.858
do I have to wait until
the sun comes up?

32:00.909 --> 32:02.058
What was that?

32:06.954 --> 32:09.637
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, fine.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.628
- All of our evidence was in there.
- What now?

32:14.215 --> 32:16.948
All right, let's do it your way.

32:32.387 --> 32:33.456
Oh, God.

32:35.630 --> 32:36.631
Hi, guys.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.159
Pass a lot of Volkswagen
Beetles on your way up?

32:39.614 --> 32:41.923
- Abby cheats at punch-buggy.
- I know.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.073
- What does it look like?
- Like someone

32:44.152 --> 32:46.420
stuffed a rag in a gas tank
and lit the fuse.

32:46.553 --> 32:47.978
And toasted our DNA.

32:48.796 --> 32:50.835
- Where's Gibbs?
- Waiting for you inside.

32:51.163 --> 32:53.106
- I'll get my gear.
- What about Senior?

32:53.679 --> 32:54.768
All right.

33:03.945 --> 33:05.271
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm...

33:05.404 --> 33:06.830
DiNozzo, court order.

33:06.958 --> 33:09.769
Winslow Residence,
Winslow Mine, including employees.

33:09.850 --> 33:10.932
Nick Kingston.

33:11.482 --> 33:12.690
Emily Kingston.

33:12.955 --> 33:14.042
Chris Kingston.

33:14.102 --> 33:15.920
You got a court order
for a five-year-old?

33:15.980 --> 33:19.208
Five-and-three-quarter. Have Abby
set up here. We'll bring her evidence.

33:25.176 --> 33:27.390
Take Ziva and McGee to the mine.
I got the residence.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.808
We got a problem. Only one car.

33:30.274 --> 33:31.310
I got a car.

33:40.392 --> 33:41.613
426 Hemi.

33:42.285 --> 33:45.050
R/T suspension package,
just the way you wanted it.

33:46.513 --> 33:47.991
Right down to the color.

33:53.953 --> 33:56.191
Are we gonna stand here staring,

33:57.007 --> 33:58.492
or are we gonna get going?

33:59.571 --> 34:01.693
That's right, I said "we".

34:28.195 --> 34:30.333
Well, hey, there.
You Nick Kingston?

34:31.364 --> 34:33.304
Now what are you looking for?

34:33.755 --> 34:35.775
I got a court order
here to take your blood.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.380
Your employees, too.

34:37.516 --> 34:38.896
You're gonna make us?

34:39.178 --> 34:41.951
Well, yeah, Nick, that's what
the little piece of paper's for.

34:48.916 --> 34:50.797
I hope I'm not interrupting dinner.

34:51.492 --> 34:53.473
Now, that's the man I remember.

34:53.754 --> 34:56.902
Just bust in before
you know what's going on.

35:00.357 --> 35:02.360
- I know.
- What do you know?

35:02.727 --> 35:03.728
Daddy?

35:04.638 --> 35:05.638
You okay?

35:06.519 --> 35:08.915
It's nothing, sweetheart.
Go back upstairs.

35:14.773 --> 35:17.464
Well, you really didn't want
Ethan around your daughter.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.054
You give him the same threat
you gave me?

35:22.137 --> 35:24.910
Well, the boy was smart
enough to stay gone.

35:25.091 --> 35:26.496
Not forever.

35:26.744 --> 35:29.054
- Emily found him.
- So I went after him?

35:29.255 --> 35:31.573
No, no, no,
that's not the way you work.

35:32.391 --> 35:33.975
You'd get somebody else to do it.

35:43.688 --> 35:44.984
- Hello, Ed.
- Jack.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.739
Got a report of a disturbance up here.

35:48.695 --> 35:51.286
- A lot of that going on tonight.
- Too much.

35:53.228 --> 35:55.030
Why don't we sit this one out?

35:59.400 --> 36:00.806
Come back for blood.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.964
That's got some poetry to it, Leroy.

36:06.199 --> 36:09.290
Yeah.
What's it gonna tell me, Chuck?

36:15.805 --> 36:17.473
Well, I'm glad that went smooth.

36:17.705 --> 36:20.293
Can't even remember where
I keep the shells for this thing.

36:20.510 --> 36:23.440
Boss, according to the time cards
from the Winslow offices,

36:23.797 --> 36:26.055
these two were working
in the mines on Friday.

36:26.621 --> 36:28.108
Notice the signatures?

36:28.796 --> 36:31.053
- But according to their blood...
- What do you got, Abs?

36:31.150 --> 36:33.776
- I'm just double-checking my results.
- It's a wonder.

36:33.994 --> 36:37.352
Well, it's more accurate to match
DNA from a blood sample at a

36:37.443 --> 36:39.146
crime scene to a source than it is to

36:39.255 --> 36:43.096
create an entire profile, but in
a pinch. I narrowed it down by type.

36:43.462 --> 36:47.462
Then I centrifuged the samples
to separate serum for electrophoresis.

36:47.721 --> 36:49.796
It's not that complicated, Jack.

36:49.870 --> 36:52.276
Well, I mean, it's a wonder
that Leroy gets any work

36:52.364 --> 36:54.246
done surrounded by
such beautiful women.

36:56.269 --> 36:58.450
Are you always this awkward
around girls?

37:02.072 --> 37:05.315
So, these two are the samples
taken from the crime scene and the ring.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.146
These guys attacked Lacombe and
Taylor.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.702
Now, the other sample is LaCombe's.

37:10.072 --> 37:11.740
Here's where it gets interesting.

37:11.820 --> 37:14.587
See these dark markers here and here?

37:14.924 --> 37:17.202
- Bisalbuminemia.
- What does that mean?

37:17.382 --> 37:19.738
Well, it's a genetically
inherited blood anomaly.

37:20.789 --> 37:23.304
They also appear in this sample.

37:23.594 --> 37:25.230
The owner of this sample

37:25.290 --> 37:27.358
is related to Lacombe.

37:28.018 --> 37:29.167
Father and son?

37:29.924 --> 37:30.924
Yep.

37:30.984 --> 37:33.341
I guess you were right
about people hiding things.

37:40.008 --> 37:42.028
Ed's locking up
those two boys from the mine.

37:43.162 --> 37:44.409
For killing Taylor.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.027
Trying to kill Ethan.

37:49.815 --> 37:50.815
He'll live.

37:52.477 --> 37:54.120
I thought you'd want to know.

37:55.134 --> 37:56.421
Since he's family.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.533
- What do you mean?
- Blood relative.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.820
I knew it.

38:01.892 --> 38:03.707
- Nick...
- Chris is his son.

38:04.051 --> 38:06.205
- I always knew it.
- No.

38:06.705 --> 38:08.837
I was already pregnant
when he got out of prison.

38:10.211 --> 38:13.884
It broke his heart, but he didn't want
to tear apart our family.

38:15.774 --> 38:16.774
You won.

38:17.056 --> 38:19.974
- You gave him your ring.
- But I never slept with him.

38:21.585 --> 38:22.585
I swear.

38:22.838 --> 38:25.199
- I don't believe you.
- Well, you should.

38:27.962 --> 38:29.269
Chris is your son.

38:32.529 --> 38:34.191
And Ethan is yours.

38:39.299 --> 38:40.299
Dad?

38:41.482 --> 38:43.838
I couldn't let the two of you...

38:46.350 --> 38:47.518
brother and sister.

38:50.977 --> 38:52.165
Now you know.

38:52.591 --> 38:53.965
Why didn't you ever say so?

38:54.341 --> 38:56.984
It would have meant acknowledging
an heir to your fortune.

38:58.759 --> 39:00.515
You sent them after Ethan?

39:01.139 --> 39:03.274
I've done a lot of things
in my life, but...

39:03.334 --> 39:05.453
Even you wouldn't try
to kill your own son.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.031
You signed the time cards
for those two miners.

39:14.489 --> 39:17.299
They weren't there,
but you knew where they really were.

39:18.889 --> 39:19.889
Get up.

39:23.153 --> 39:26.040
Why couldn't you ever just believe me?

39:44.047 --> 39:46.207
- Shotgun. Called it first.
- Shotgun. Called it first.

39:48.958 --> 39:49.959
What?

39:51.050 --> 39:53.980
Jack, I just... I mean,
I don't want to be intrusive.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.881
It was so nice to meet you.

39:57.609 --> 39:58.639
She is a hugger.

39:59.740 --> 40:00.740
Fantastic.

40:03.402 --> 40:06.194
Jack... I just... I gotta know
some things. I got a lot of questions.

40:06.257 --> 40:07.683
You can have two, DiNozzo.

40:09.627 --> 40:11.587
- Where do I start?
- You got one left.

40:12.848 --> 40:14.848
Well, that doesn't count,
'cause that...

40:15.901 --> 40:17.327
Okay... the rules.

40:17.826 --> 40:20.618
Did he learn them from you?
I mean, did you teach him all the rules?

40:20.769 --> 40:23.266
I'm sorry, son.
I didn't teach him much of anything.

40:23.511 --> 40:24.874
He taught me to drive.

40:25.287 --> 40:28.317
No, boss, not backseat, middle hump.
I... I got that...

40:28.579 --> 40:30.505
- that thing we talked about.
- Take them.

40:35.191 --> 40:37.064
It's just cluttering up the garage.

40:41.182 --> 40:42.996
You're a great man, Jackson Gibbs.

40:43.334 --> 40:44.760
Thanks for the sweater.

40:54.972 --> 40:58.794
I know you hate it when I use
a hundred words when a couple will do.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.470
But give us a call sometime.

41:03.447 --> 41:04.893
It's the least I could do.

41:11.291 --> 41:12.563
Good-bye, son.

41:20.621 --> 41:21.624
Bye, Dad.

42:00.259 --> 42:02.438
What were you and
those guys fighting about?

42:04.028 --> 42:05.434
I don't even remember.

42:07.180 --> 42:08.407
You should stop.

42:12.143 --> 42:13.875
Are you waiting for the train, too?

42:16.566 --> 42:19.788
- We could sit together.
- I don't know. It's a long ride.

42:21.758 --> 42:23.718
But I guess you're not a lumberjack.

42:24.272 --> 42:26.034
- No.
- Well, I have a rule.

42:26.094 --> 42:28.629
It's either rule #1 or #3.

42:28.816 --> 42:30.466
Never date a lumberjack.

42:31.570 --> 42:33.966
- You got a rule for everything?
- Working on it.

42:35.414 --> 42:37.533
Everyone needs a code
they can live by.

42:39.197 --> 42:40.247
What's your name?

42:42.114 --> 42:44.035
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

42:46.948 --> 42:48.473
I'm just gonna call you Gibbs.

42:49.439 --> 42:51.203
You can call me anything you want.

42:54.048 --> 42:55.078
I'm Shannon.
