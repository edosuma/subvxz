Have a seat.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.700
How's the arm?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.900
Fractured in two places.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.600
(machine beeps)Gil, Conrad again.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.100

00:41.400 --> 00:42.500
It's feeling better?

00:42.600 --> 00:43.700
Yeah.Good.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.700
(drums fingers on desk)So, you must know where he is.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.700
Actually, I don't.

00:48.700 --> 00:49.600
Really?

00:50.100 --> 00:51.500
Okay, um...

00:52.900 --> 00:54.500
Look, I don't want to playany games here.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.400
This is as difficult for meas it is for you.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.600
So let's just, uh,get this over with, shall we?

01:09.300 --> 01:12.400
Okay then, uh, this is anadministrative inquiry.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.400
You and your supervisor

01:14.400 --> 01:16.600
were in direct violationof lab policy...

01:16.600 --> 01:17.500
"Are."

01:19.400 --> 01:21.500
"Are" in direct violationof Lab policy

01:21.500 --> 01:23.500
which states that membersof the same forensic team

01:23.500 --> 01:26.100
may not engagein a romantic relationship.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.500
So when did you andSupervisor Grissom

01:29.500 --> 01:31.000
begin yourrelationship?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.200
We've always had a relationship.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.600
I mean when didyou become intimate?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.000
Two years ago.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.600
I thinkit was a Sunday.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.800
HOLSTEIN:Sagebrush Valley High School.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
The Cobras.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.300
He looks like he couldstill be in high school.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.200
Boy, football's gottena lot more brutal

03:09.200 --> 03:10.700
since my playing days.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.400
Yeah, where's the rest ofhim, still on the field?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.900
There's no high school footballfields around here anyway.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.700
What do you think, Grissom?

03:22.500 --> 03:23.800
"Ichabod was horror-struck

03:23.800 --> 03:26.100
on perceivingthat he was headless."

04:15.400 --> 04:18.300
Blood pool tells me the helmetmust've been here for a while.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.700
Vehicle tire rolled through it.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.700
Helmet has black abrasionson it

04:24.700 --> 04:26.500
consistent with being hitby a tire.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.300
Probably got pinballeddown the road.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.100
I checked with Traffic.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.100
No reports of any trafficaccidents near here.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.500
Uh, Holstein's gettingan absentee list

04:35.500 --> 04:36.600
from the high school.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.200
Head's over there.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.500
Blood trail leads up from here.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.500
We follow the blood.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.900
He say anything aboutwhat's happening with Sara?

04:55.800 --> 04:56.500
No.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.500
Hey, did Sara eversay anything to you

05:27.500 --> 05:28.700
about her and Grissom?

05:29.400 --> 05:30.800
Not in so many words.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.300
So you knew aboutthe two of them?

05:34.300 --> 05:34.900
Yeah.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.200
Hey!

06:15.900 --> 06:17.200
Where's the uniform?

06:18.800 --> 06:20.600
If he's not a player, what's with the helmet?

06:21.300 --> 06:22.700
SANDERS:Maybe he's a rabid fan.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.600
There were all kindsof high school games last night.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.200
Where's s hand?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.000
Got to be ound here somewhere.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.100
The hand--where did you find it?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.500
20 yards away,two hours later.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.400
ROBBINS:David, he doesn't repped.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.700
What's taking so long?

06:49.700 --> 06:51.400
I can't get the helmet off.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.800
I better get this ten-cardto Mandy right away.

06:59.900 --> 07:00.900
You hold the helmet.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.600
His face looks like hamburger.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.900
I found the same black powderon his clothes.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Hey, Mandy.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.400
I got a ten-cardon our John Doe.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.000
Well, let's see if it matches

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
the safe-kitthat Holstein brought in.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.100
Only have one more kidunaccounted for

07:36.100 --> 07:37.500
at that high school.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
Hey, if you had a kid,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
would you collecta safe-kit on them?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.800
Why not?It's better to be prepared.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.600
Think of itas a cheap insurance policy.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.300
It's just a print card,a cheek swab and a photo.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.900
Then go to bed every nighthoping you don't have to use it.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.500
Mm. well, there's a match.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.600
Your John Doeis Vincent Bartley.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.100
Yeah?

08:04.200 --> 08:04.800
Yeah.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.000
Okay, good.Thanks.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.100
You're welcome.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.400
Well, nothing.I mean, it was dark.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.000
It was really dark.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.800
BROWN:One minute we're married,and the next...

08:18.800 --> 08:20.500
You know what?Good for you.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.700
Divorces shouldbe like Band-Aids,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.900
one quick yank and done.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.700
BROWN:You think?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.000
Oh, what do I know?

08:29.100 --> 08:32.900
Eddie and I stayed togetherway too long.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.799
Every decision wasan act of Congress.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.700
It's the end of an era,ladies and gentlemen.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.400
Hampton Huxley,publisher of <i>Hux</i> magazine--

08:51.400 --> 08:53.000
where boys became men,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.400
and men becamemore manly-- has died.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.000
That magazinegot me through Vietnam.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.600
Oh, that would explainsthe lookers out front.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.900
They were Kitties.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.100
Yes, Kitties, indeed.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.900
He was dining with a coupleof them when he bought the farm.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.400
Miss Summerand Miss Winter, I believe.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.200
Every male in thePhillips family

09:10.300 --> 09:11.900
gets a lifetimesubscription to <i>Hux</i>

09:11.900 --> 09:14.100
for his Bar Mitzvah.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.000
I guess my sons will haveto settle for a Cross pen.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.500
I'm sure the magazinewill go on without him, Dave.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.900
What are we looking at?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.100
Puncture wound.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.600
Um... no abrasion ring.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.100
But I can reapproximatethe skin.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.600
So it's probably not a gunshot.Stabbing?

09:32.600 --> 09:34.500
Maybe. Right through the temple,into the brain.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.300
Be lights out in seconds.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.600
It's a crowded restaurant.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.100
Somebody must have seensomething.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.800
Not exactly.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.000
Welcome tothe latest fad.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.700
Dining in the dark.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.900
Waiters are blind.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.200
No one sees anything.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.700
Piece of cake, huh?

09:55.400 --> 09:57.100
Did he just leave?

09:57.600 --> 09:58.700
I think so.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.700
Guys

10:01.900 --> 10:03.600
I'm a dead body here.

10:12.500 --> 10:17.200
<i>Dining should be an experience,</i> <i>like opera or art.</i>

10:20.100 --> 10:22.800
 <i>It should feed the soul</i> <i>as well as the belly.</i>

10:22.800 --> 10:26.300
<i>You should smell it, touch it</i> <i>and let it rest on your tongue.</i>

10:29.900 --> 10:31.800
 <i>I'm selling sensuality here.</i>

10:31.800 --> 10:34.200
 <i>I encourage eating</i> <i>with your hands.</i>

10:37.000 --> 10:38.600
 <i>Texture is crucial.</i>

10:38.900 --> 10:41.200
 <i>The salty, meaty flesh</i> <i>of lobster</i>

10:41.200 --> 10:43.800
 <i>drenched in creamy,</i> <i>clarified French butter.</i>

10:47.500 --> 10:51.600
 <i>The pulpy seeded flesh</i> <i>and firm skin of a fresh fig</i>

10:52.000 --> 10:53.200
 <i>dipped in honey.</i>

10:59.300 --> 11:02.400
 <i>The tongue understands</i> <i>four major taste groups--</i>

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
 <i>salty, sweet, sour, bitter--</i>

11:05.700 --> 11:08.000
 <i>and has over 10,000 taste buds,</i>

11:08.600 --> 11:10.000
 <i>each with a direct connection</i>

11:10.000 --> 11:12.200
 <i>to the pleasure center</i> <i>of the brain,</i>

11:12.200 --> 11:14.000
 <i>triggering endorphins.</i>

11:14.900 --> 11:17.600
 <i>The anticipation and the</i> <i>release of eating good food</i>

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
 <i>is chemically quite similar</i>

11:19.600 --> 11:21.300
to getting high on drugs.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.200
And apparentlyjust as dangerous.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.300
So tell mewhat happened.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.300
I don't know.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.700
Each one of the waitershas one of those clickers.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.500
If there's an emergency,the houselights come up

11:33.500 --> 11:36.100
and a red light goes offin the kitchen.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.100
WOMAN:Somebody help!(alarm buzzing)

11:38.100 --> 11:40.000
(screaming)Help! Help him!

11:40.600 --> 11:42.300
Are you okay?WOMAN:Hux!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.600
Call 9-1-1.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.100
Oh, so you didn't see anything?

11:46.200 --> 11:47.400
I'm in the kitchen.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.400
I have two sittings anight, at 7:00 and 10:00,

11:50.900 --> 11:54.100
average 25 heads,ten courses per.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.900
I have no time to pee.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.500
April was here...

11:59.700 --> 12:02.500
and Huxley was here.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.600
BROWN:Okay.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
Got blood on the chair.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.800
Blood on the tablecloth.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.900
Blood drops on the floor,

12:27.400 --> 12:29.600
leading away from Hux's chair.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.300
Stab him. Extract the weapon.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.100
Drip, drip, drip.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.200
And they end here.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.800
Near Ms. Shasta.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.600
WOMAN: <i>Shasta McCloud--</i>

12:41.600 --> 12:44.800
big "M," little "c,"big "C," plus "loud."

12:44.800 --> 12:45.600
McCloud.(chuckles)

12:46.200 --> 12:49.200
On TV, they never show anyonebleeding from a heart attack.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.600
Is that whatyou think happened?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.800
Well, yeah. I mean, allthat Prevalis and diet soda.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.800
I just figured...

12:53.800 --> 12:55.700
April, shh!

12:56.400 --> 12:58.800
He was an animaluntil the day he died, sir.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.600
Uh-huh.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.800
Wait a minute.What did happen?

13:02.100 --> 13:03.799
Well-Well, you'rethe one with blood on you.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.999
Maybe you can tell me.

13:05.000 --> 13:05.999
I thoughthe just fell asleep

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
like he always doesat the end of meals.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.400
APRIL:Come on! Wake up, Huxey.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.499
(in animated voice):Wake up, Huxey.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.099
Wake up, Huxey-Hux.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.799
Come on, it's time to go.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.600
Meow, meow!

13:26.700 --> 13:27.699
Waiter!

13:27.700 --> 13:29.999
Emergency!April?April, what's wrong?!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.999
Call 9-1-1!Help!April! April!

13:32.000 --> 13:33.399

13:33.400 --> 13:34.500
Code red!

13:34.500 --> 13:37.999
(screaming)Help! Help us!

13:38.000 --> 13:41.699
Okay. Um, look, I'm goingto need to take your sweater.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.400
Yeah, like I haven'theard <i>that</i> one before.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.699
(giggles)No. No, I don't meanright now.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.899
No, I mean, I... I'll needto take it before I go.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.199
You know, later, when I,when I leave,

13:51.200 --> 13:53.200
I have to takeyour sweater then.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.900
Mr. Bartley?

14:05.200 --> 14:08.199
Matt. I'm Vincent's brother.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.200
I'm... Nick.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.800
Stokes.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.999
Uh...

14:14.000 --> 14:16.100
You don't needto say it.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.800
I knew when the detective asked me for that safe-kit

14:18.800 --> 14:20.300
that it was going to be Vinnie.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.600
Shouldn't I be talking to your parents?

14:23.600 --> 14:25.600
ny paren.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.400
Mom skipped outwhen we were little,

14:27.800 --> 14:29.899
and Dad died acoupleears ago.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.800
It's just the two of us.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.300
Matt...

14:36.100 --> 14:38.799
your brother wasn'ton the football team,

14:38.800 --> 14:39.700
but when we found him,

14:39.700 --> 14:41.499
he was wearinga football helmet.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.600
Why is that?

14:42.600 --> 14:44.300
It was my old helmet.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.000
Is that how you got injured?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.300
No.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.699
It was the last dayof spring break, and...

14:50.700 --> 14:52.500
I was wasted.

14:53.900 --> 14:54.799
Like a dumb-ass,

14:54.800 --> 14:57.700
I dove into the TangierswaS. pool headfirst.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.700
Fractured my T-1 vertebra.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.000
So why the helmet?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.700
Well, I was a pretDJoodfootball player.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.700
He was proud of that.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.400
That and my dad's dragon belt.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.700
He got it when hewas in the service.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
Vinnie wearsit every day.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
It's just somethingthat he has to hold onto...

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
(voice breaks) ...to deal with.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.100
(softly):Yeah.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.700
You know, one of these could'vebeen the murder weapon.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.800
It's approximatein size and shape.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.900
And everybody had one.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.200
Well, something dripped overhere that is not blood.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.300
Well, could've been whateverfood was on the skewers.

15:51.500 --> 15:55.200
ALS will pick up anythingthat's fatty or dairy-based.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.700
Could you turn off thelights for a second?

16:22.400 --> 16:26.599
I'm sorry, but this is a stupididea for a restaurant.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.400
I need to see what I'm eating.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.500
BROWN:I can see just fine.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Where are you?

16:36.100 --> 16:37.600
Right here.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.000
Oh.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.200
Hi.Hello.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.100
Night vision goggles?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.100
Yeah, someoneleft these behind.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.700
Kind of defeats the purposeof dining in the dark.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.600
Unless you don't comehere for the food.

17:01.700 --> 17:02.900
BROWN:Mr. Nivens.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.599
Are these yours?

17:11.099 --> 17:12.599
I'll take that as a "yes."

17:15.500 --> 17:17.800
Wait, wait... Ididn't kill anyone.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.900
Then why would your bringmilitary-grade,

17:19.900 --> 17:21.599
night vision gogglesto the restaurant?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.599
A hunch.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.400
MAN:Yeah.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.800
Oh, that's so good.Tastes so good

17:30.800 --> 17:34.000
NIVE:Sweetheart, you want to trysome of my steak?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.100
WOMAN:No, thanks.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.600
I'm all good.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.300
Yeah...(giggles)

17:45.500 --> 17:47.400
Mmm...

17:51.400 --> 17:52.800
Always bAliciowhen your wifeC.ants

17:52.900 --> 17:55.800
to dine in the darkwith another couple.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.400
You brought night vision gogglesto spy on me during dinner?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.300
Damn right.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.999
Millions of tireswear out ever year.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.200
You ever wonder whereall that rubber dust goes?

18:15.200 --> 18:16.600
No, I don't.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.000
The black powder trace you foundin your victim's clothing

18:20.000 --> 18:21.399
was tire rubber.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
It's not surprising.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.900
we found the body onthe side of the highway.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.100
Of courseyou would expect that.

18:25.100 --> 18:28.700
However, I did find some veryinteresting type of rubber.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.100
Okay, Hodges, dazzle me.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.999
Truck tires have 27% isopreneand 14% neoprene.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.400
That's what makesthem so hard.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.499
Passenger tires have a lowerisoprene-to-neoprene ratio,

18:39.500 --> 18:40.599
but they also have silica

18:40.600 --> 18:42.800
for fuel economyand wet traction.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.200
 <i>Go-cart tires, or "slicks,"</i>

18:45.900 --> 18:47.999
to those in the know,have much higher levels

18:48.000 --> 18:49.199
of carbon black and oil,

18:49.200 --> 18:51.100
resulting in extremelyhigh traction.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.300
Guess I betterget my go-cart on.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.100
You know,just so you know,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.700
I'm a bit of go-cartenthusiast myself.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.600
Oh, uh...that's awesome.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.200
Have you seen this guy before?

19:09.100 --> 19:10.899
Day before yesterday.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.099
Day before that,and the day before that.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.500
Oh, man,, d he get in trouble?

19:15.600 --> 19:17.100
Are these therace stats?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.099
I.Uh-huh.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.500
u keep record of them?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.099
Yeah, all in here.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.300
People ask for them every day

19:22.300 --> 19:24.000
like they'resome sort of trophy.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.700
Could you print outVincent Bartley's trophy

19:26.700 --> 19:28.400
from the last timehe was here?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.900
Yeah. But I'm notgetting him in trouble, am I?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.900
No.No, not really.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.599
You know, when I was a kid,we used to make these things

19:35.600 --> 19:37.899
out of lunch traysand old lawn mower engines.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.600
When I was kid,I used to make bombs,

19:40.200 --> 19:41.900
and origami.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.200
Oh.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.700
"Vinnie Vroom."Won all three of his races.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.000
Beat out a guy named "Hot Rod."

19:49.100 --> 19:51.300
Vinnie rancircles around him.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.299
Yes.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.500
Yes. Yes, isthat all you got?

20:17.500 --> 20:18.800
Is that all you got?

20:18.800 --> 20:22.599
Is that all you got?Is that all you got?

20:22.600 --> 20:26.600
Rodney went from being A-Rodto being No-Rod.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.400
Hey, there he is,right there.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.699
Aw, come on.Hey, if you guys want to race,

20:31.700 --> 20:34.200
then you guys haveto wear dresses, huh?

20:34.500 --> 20:35.599
Get your skillup, all right.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.900
I need somecompetition here.Hot Rod!

21:02.600 --> 21:03.400
Get out of the truck!

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
Get out of the truck now!

21:05.400 --> 21:07.900
Get out ofthe truck now!

21:10.900 --> 21:13.099
like running from the cops,dumb-ass.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.800
Give me his wallet.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.500
Rodney Banks.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.300
We're with the Vegas Crime Lab,Mr. Banks.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.600
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.199
You got quite a mess here, Rod.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.000
Mind if I take a look?

21:33.900 --> 21:35.299
Where'd you get that belt?

21:35.300 --> 21:35.999
I don't know.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.200
Where?I don't know.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.200
Blood.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.100
Looks like things just gota lot hotter for you, Rod.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.100
All skewers accounted for,none of them bloody.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.599
We've got ahigh-profile dead guy

22:06.600 --> 22:08.200
in a locked-roomsituation,

22:08.200 --> 22:12.800
with 16 dinersand three blind waiters.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.300
Give me something.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.900
How about a Band-Aidwith petals?

22:27.100 --> 22:29.200
It's not a Band-Aid.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.400
It's a nipple flower.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.100
What's it doing at a tablewith four guys?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.200
MAN: <i>Can I go to the bathroom?</i>

22:45.000 --> 22:46.600

22:47.300 --> 22:48.499
(laughing):We slipped a laxative

22:48.500 --> 22:50.800
in his beer in the dark.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.299
It's his sixth tripto the can.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.999
It's freakin'hilarious.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.200
What are you guys,like 12 years old?

22:57.300 --> 22:58.599
Oh, hey, hey, Curly.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.400

23:02.500 --> 23:03.499
Huh?

23:03.500 --> 23:05.200
MAN:Breast exam.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.900
You guys, come here.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.300
It's total darkness.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.800

23:18.800 --> 23:20.600

23:23.200 --> 23:25.600

23:45.200 --> 23:46.499

23:46.500 --> 23:47.900
That's not you, Hux?

23:47.900 --> 23:49.499

23:56.400 --> 23:59.000

23:59.400 --> 24:02.700
He and his brothers hadhad quite a bit to drink.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.000
So it was the blindleading the drunk, huh?

24:05.300 --> 24:07.500
I could do itwith my eyes closed.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.300
Well, did you, did youhear anything unusual?

24:10.500 --> 24:12.900
No. Everyone seemed to be havinga good time.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.500
Until the womanin the fuzzy dress shrieked.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.499
I found Mr. Huxleyslumped forward.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.599
Checked for a pulse,and he didn't have one,

24:19.600 --> 24:21.499
so I turned onthe emergency lights.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.800
Then she really screamed.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.099
Is she pretty?

24:27.100 --> 24:30.200
She hada pretty girl scream.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.799
BRASS:Oh, man.

Sure.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.800
We're going to walk,straight ahead.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.200
Looks like there wassome kind of struggle.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.600

26:59.300 --> 27:01.000
cut his body up.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.099
and dumped iton the side of the road.

Whoa, man.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.300
I swear I didn'tkill anybody.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.600
Or I didn't cutanybody up or dump 'em.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.600
All I did was askhim for a rematch...

27:14.600 --> 27:17.600
off the track, whereit really counts.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.100

27:53.300 --> 27:58.500
So your statement is he justspontaneously lost his head?

27:58.500 --> 27:59.700
Yeah.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.599
You know, one minute,he's staring at me.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.599
The next, I look back,and the Headless Horseman

28:04.600 --> 28:06.300
is driving his cngt.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.600
And then what happened?

28:23.700 --> 28:26.400
So why you just didn'tditch the carts?

28:27.800 --> 28:30.500
Christin, that...that girl at the track,

28:30.500 --> 28:32.800
she let us sneak out with them.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.500
You know, mylife was turning

28:34.600 --> 28:36.800
into a horror movie-- I didn'twant to bring he

28:36.800 --> 28:38.300
in on it.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.399
You've been dodging me;it's timeo talk.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.299
Gil, nobody wants tohear about your lovelife less than I do,

28:52.300 --> 28:54.400
but since you didn't handlethis right, I have to take

28:54.500 --> 28:56.400
a formal statement.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.899
Should've been a conversationbetween friends.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.000
I mean, we could've foundsome way around this.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.199
Catherine could have doneSara's evaluations.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.300
Why didn't you just tell me?

29:10.100 --> 29:11.900
We didn't want you to know.

29:12.900 --> 29:16.000
Don't most women like the worldto know they're dating someone?

29:17.200 --> 29:20.300
Where do you get yourinformation about women, Conrad?

29:23.600 --> 29:27.200
Okay, so, when did you two,you know?

29:31.800 --> 29:33.200
Nine years ago.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.799
You know what?

29:36.800 --> 29:39.000
You two need to getyour stories straight.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.700
There's road gravelembedded in all these tires.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.100
Yeah, but no visible bloodon that one.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.600
Got a worn areaon this front bumper.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.800
Some brown trace.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.100
Same goes for the rearofe.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.999
Well, if it turns outto be leather,

30:19.000 --> 30:19.299
it would confirm

30:19.300 --> 30:22.100
Hot Rod's story that hetowed the second cart back

30:22.100 --> 30:25.100
using Vinnie's belt.Got what looks like...

30:25.100 --> 30:27.100
blood on this wheel well.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.200
This is the victim's cart.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.200
Must have been movin'when his head popped off.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.000
Well, another onefor the scrapbook.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.299
Boy, he looks differentwithout hair.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.299
Never knew he wore a toupee.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.300
Oh, uh, it hadsomething sticky on it,

30:54.300 --> 30:55.700
so I bagged it for Trace.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.099
But if you want, we could putit back on for the photo op.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.600
No, that's okay;let's get to cutting.

31:16.900 --> 31:19.600
ROBBINS:Embedded horizontallyin the parenchyma

31:19.600 --> 31:21.600
of the right temporal lobe

31:21.800 --> 31:25.299
is a linear, silver-toned,

31:25.300 --> 31:28.300
metal tubethat tapers to a point.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.399
And in this case, David,

31:30.400 --> 31:33.500
the pen may be mightierthan the sword.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.000
BRASS:Okay.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.299
Okay, thatpen's not mine.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.200
(chuckling):Yeah. Nice try, sweetheart.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.300
Excuse me.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.299
Can I be Lucy Logic for a bit?

31:52.300 --> 31:54.600
First of all, thatpurse is designer.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.399
There's no way I'mruining it with ink.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
Second of all, I knowwhere my bread is buttered.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.700
Hux was my meal ticket--kill him, go hungry.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.400
Unless you're in the will.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.900
Kitties don't get in the will.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.400
Besides, if I had touchedthat thing,

32:10.400 --> 32:12.600
wouldn't I have inkon my hands?

32:12.600 --> 32:12.999
Hmm.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.199
Whoever did itditched the pen in my bag.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.900
It was on the back of my chairthe whole time.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.199
It could have been anyone.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.500
What about the guywho assaulted me?

32:20.700 --> 32:22.600
SHASTA:Look, if you reallywant a suspect,

32:22.800 --> 32:24.799
you need to check outlittle miss chef lady.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.300
Little miss chef lady?

32:26.600 --> 32:28.100
Why is that?Hello.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.400
Duh, she's...Winter Issue?

32:30.400 --> 32:32.800
1995.

32:33.400 --> 32:36.600
You certainly weren't hidinganything back then.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.800
Hmm?

32:40.300 --> 32:44.600
Ms. Sanchez, accordingto your fellow Kitties,

32:44.900 --> 32:46.800
you and Huxleyhad a falling out.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.000
It's curious that youdidn't mention that.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.100
I didn't mention it,because it's ancient history.

32:55.100 --> 32:58.600
12 years ago, a misogynisttold me I should eat less.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.300
And today, I now have a hotrestaurant on the Strip

33:02.300 --> 33:05.399
and two contracts forspots in L.A. and Chicago.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.500
"Food Seduction"is a best-seller.

33:08.700 --> 33:11.300
I think I won thatbattle already.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.099
So, did you and Huxley speakto each other last night?

33:15.100 --> 33:18.200
His reservation wasbooked under a pseudonym.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.400
I didn't evenknow he was there.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.600
Mr. Brass,

33:24.700 --> 33:27.100
do you know whyI started my restaurant?

33:27.200 --> 33:28.700
No. Tell me.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.300
Because I fell in lovewith a blind man.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.500
He would turn off the lightsand feed me.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.900
When you deprive one sense,other senses are heightened.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.100
My only focus was on my tongue.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.900
It was brilliant.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.300
And then he died.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.700
And this restaurantis an homage to him.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.700
To our love affair.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.100
How nice for you.

33:59.900 --> 34:04.000
I don't mean to be crude,but a murder is,

34:04.000 --> 34:08.600
???

35:19.100 --> 35:20.099
Hey.Hey.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.499
So, Huxley had

35:21.500 --> 35:22.999
honey on his hairpiece,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.299
ink in his brainand blood all over.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.799
There were three peoplewho had honey on their hands:

35:27.800 --> 35:29.900
the frisky coupleand Miael.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.699
Two people who had bloodon their clothing:

35:31.700 --> 35:32.300
April and Michael.

35:32.300 --> 35:34.699
And there was a total of fivepeople moving around the room:

35:34.700 --> 35:36.799
two Manducci brothersand all three waiters.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.099
Now, that's a lot of listsfor Michael to turn up on.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.899
He does work there,so there's reason for it, but...

35:41.900 --> 35:43.700
Well, there's noreason for this.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.700
Michael's print inink, on a napkin.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
What would he haveagainst Huxley?

35:50.600 --> 35:52.499
His prints hit backto an old work card.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.099
The guy used to be a chef.

35:54.100 --> 35:54.999
A blind chef?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.100
He lost his sighta few years back.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.700
But before that,guess who was his so-chef?

36:01.800 --> 36:03.599
"The man knew his wayaround a kitchen,

36:03.600 --> 36:05.900
"and his way into my heart.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.299
"Michael would spend hoursteaching me,

36:09.300 --> 36:13.100
feedg me... loving me."

36:13.200 --> 36:15.400
So, you're the dead guy?

36:15.400 --> 36:17.800
She seduces me,

36:17.800 --> 36:21.399
steals my recipes, myideas, my instors.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.600
And then she hires meas a freakg waiter.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.599
Night after night,I listen to her

36:26.600 --> 36:29.499
tell storiesof the tragic love affair,

36:29.500 --> 36:32.100
of the poor, dead blind guy.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.500
Last night,I finally confronted her.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.499
I deserve a piece of the action.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.800
At $200 a head,

36:39.800 --> 36:42.699
you're clearing at least$1,000 in tips at night.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.800
That's a lot of actionfor a blind man.

36:45.700 --> 36:46.899
I made you.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.999
You're fired.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.400
We're done.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.699
But why kill Huxley?

36:53.700 --> 36:54.999
Why not just her?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
I'm blind. She's not.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.799
But in that dining room,everybody else is blind, too.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.799
And when Huxley walkedin with his Kitties,

37:03.800 --> 37:06.800
it was like a signfrom the gods.

37:07.900 --> 37:11.100
I knew I could destroyher and the restaurant.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.899
 <i>I waited till</i> <i>the oyster course.</i>

37:15.900 --> 37:19.099
 <i>The shells clanging,</i> <i>and slurping,</i>

37:19.100 --> 37:20.199
 <i>the "oohing," the "aahing,"</i>

37:20.200 --> 37:22.700
 <i>I knew it would cover</i> <i>any noise I was going to make.</i>

37:32.400 --> 37:36.700
I wanted her rotting in jail,eating bologna sandwiches.

37:40.700 --> 37:42.399
If you wanted to frame Pippa,

37:42.400 --> 37:45.800
why did you plant the penin Shasta's purse?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.600
I tell everyone to puttheir purses and jackets

37:47.600 --> 37:48.799
on the back of the chairs,

37:48.800 --> 37:51.800
so I knew exactlywhere her purse was.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.100
Old cat frames young Kitty.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.100
Kind of perfect.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.300
SANDERS: <i>We found high velocity</i> <i>blood spatter</i>

38:14.300 --> 38:16.899
inside the rear wheel wellof the victim's cart,

38:16.900 --> 38:19.300
which means he losthis head at high speed.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.400
So how did Hot Roddecapitate Vinnie

38:21.400 --> 38:24.100
while racing down a highwayat 60 miles an hour?

38:24.800 --> 38:26.300
Maybe he didn't.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.600
Well, people's heads just don'tfly off for no reason.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.600
Maybe we should eck the scenefor some wires or branches,

38:33.600 --> 38:34.999
or something hecould've run into.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.400
If it would'vehappened that way,

38:36.400 --> 38:38.299
we would've found tracefrom whatever did it.

38:38.300 --> 38:41.099
The only trace in the neckand arm wounds

38:41.100 --> 38:42.799
was rubber from truck tires.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.099
Which was present on both sidesof his wounds

38:45.100 --> 38:46.299
but not on his clothing.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.899
There were blown out tirefragments all over the road.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.799
But we found his bodyoff the road.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.300
There shouldn't be any transferfrom truck tires.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.500
Unless...

39:12.400 --> 39:13.800
What's going on here?

39:14.200 --> 39:15.399
We're trying to determine

39:15.400 --> 39:17.799
whether a steel-beltedtruck tire

39:17.800 --> 39:20.200
can decapitate a kiddriving a go-cart.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.000
I thought that wasan urban myth.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.399
Myths, legends, tall tales--

39:25.400 --> 39:27.200
they all comefrom something real.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.200
If that go-cart was going60 miles an hour

39:29.200 --> 39:31.699
drafting a truckgoing the same speed,

39:31.700 --> 39:33.100
and that truck blows a tire

39:33.100 --> 39:35.399
sending a two-pound projectileinto the driver's neck...

39:35.400 --> 39:38.200
The combined speed of impactwould be 120 miles an hour.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.600
Which is about...962 foot-poundsof energy.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.700
All right, let's go, fellas.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.600
Come on, Conrad.There's always room for Jell-O.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.800
It's expensive Jell-o.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.600
SANDERS (excitedly):I love this.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.500
Well, it worked.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.100
See if we can't reusesome of that.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.200
When did you tellEcklie we got involved?

40:40.700 --> 40:42.600
Two years ago.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.900
Why? What did you tell him?

40:46.700 --> 40:48.300
Nine years ago.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.400
The ForensicAcademy Conference?

40:54.900 --> 40:56.100
Yeah.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.999
You, uh, had toomany questions

41:00.000 --> 41:02.600
about anthropologyfor some reason.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.699
Well, I was stalling.

41:03.700 --> 41:06.400
I was trying to get the nerveto ask you to dinner.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.300
You had a ponytail.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.000
I'm going to move to Swing.

41:22.500 --> 41:23.499
We talked about this.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.899
I know that you saidthat you would do it,

41:24.900 --> 41:26.900
but I don't want to do thatto the team.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.000
Besides...

41:30.100 --> 41:34.600
I am sure that I could usemore daylight in my life.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.100
We should go.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.000
Yeah.

42:12.300 --> 42:13.200
Whoo!

42:13.200 --> 42:14.999
You, uh, you want a ride?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.700
Wish I could.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.099
What about you, Ricky Bobby?

42:18.100 --> 42:20.499
No, thanks,I like to watch.

42:20.500 --> 42:21.700
Okay.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.600
You should go.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.900
Yeah?Yeah, you should go.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.000
Okay.
