00:00.070 --> 00:01.367
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.424 --> 00:05.290
Once the money comes in, I pay you back, Julie and I live happily ever after.

00:05.342 --> 00:06.381
Will you marry me, Julie?

00:06.437 --> 00:09.248
Sandy, I'm not coming home. I'm going to Lake Arrowhead with a friend.

00:09.289 --> 00:11.735
What am I going to do when you're gone? I can't do this without you.

00:11.787 --> 00:14.552
Nothing I hate more than perky blondes who want to take over the world.

00:14.609 --> 00:16.876
- Taylor Townsend?
- Jack Hess. Nice to meet you.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.298
- I'm getting kicked out.
- No, but Marissa is.

00:19.345 --> 00:20.998
I want you out of here right now.

00:21.049 --> 00:23.641
- Get your hands off of her!
- Another word, you're out of this school.

00:23.696 --> 00:25.182
- Don't touch her!
- Ryan!

00:25.488 --> 00:28.760
Either of you ever set foot near this school, I call the police.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.785
This is so wrong.

00:34.914 --> 00:36.302
Like, epically tragic,

00:36.369 --> 00:38.541
end of the world, locusts and horned beast bummer.

00:38.586 --> 00:40.593
Aw, it's fine. It's really not that bad, guys.

00:40.634 --> 00:44.094
Yeah. I mean, Ryan and I don't go to Harbor anymore, but it'll be fine.

00:44.146 --> 00:45.148
Not for me.

00:45.206 --> 00:48.007
Yeah. Without Ryan, it'll be like freshman year for Cohen.

00:48.073 --> 00:50.715
Slammed into lockers, shoes peed in,

00:50.755 --> 00:52.477
ridiculed as "Death Breath" Seth.

00:52.518 --> 00:54.090
Didn't you used to call him that?

00:55.386 --> 00:57.060
This was supposed to be the best year ever.

00:57.104 --> 00:58.672
Okay, you're really not cheering us up here.

00:58.713 --> 00:59.794
Why do you need cheering up?

00:59.845 --> 01:01.953
I'm the one who's going to get his ass cheeks duct-taped together.

01:01.994 --> 01:03.495
Whoa. Yeah. You guys should be psyched.

01:03.535 --> 01:05.702
No mean dean, no annoying Taylor Townsend.

01:05.747 --> 01:06.894
A year in free footwear.

01:06.945 --> 01:08.303
Freedom to do whatever you want.

01:08.363 --> 01:10.663
Except what I want is to go to school.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.465
Well, at least you guys have each other.

01:12.517 --> 01:14.686
If you stick together, everything will be okay.

01:16.361 --> 01:17.120
Deal?

01:17.923 --> 01:18.650
Deal.

01:22.096 --> 01:23.181
Hi, Mom.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.716
Okay. She wants me home right away to discuss my future.

01:28.793 --> 01:30.759
All right. We'll hook up later, then?

01:31.772 --> 01:32.581
Oh.

01:33.136 --> 01:33.954
Hello.

01:34.788 --> 01:36.078
Yeah. All right. Be right there.

01:37.057 --> 01:38.623
- Sandy.
- So...?

01:38.936 --> 01:41.766
- Uh... have a good day.
- Thanks, man. You, too.

01:42.182 --> 01:42.812
Sorry.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.787
You guys, both of you, have a good day together.

01:49.191 --> 01:50.445
You really believe all that stuff?

01:50.507 --> 01:52.980
What? That you'll be ridiculed at school? Definitely.

01:53.042 --> 01:56.145
About Ryan and Marissa sticking together, and everything being okay.

01:56.206 --> 02:00.198
Well, if they can stick together, I don't know. They've survived a lot.

02:00.256 --> 02:02.518
I don't know that they can survive this.

02:02.579 --> 02:03.584
I'm going to need you to hold me.

02:03.644 --> 02:05.611
- Hold me.
- Come on. Come on.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.955 --> 02:40.652
Look. I've never done this before.

02:40.714 --> 02:43.100
No, no. I am in charge.

02:43.602 --> 02:46.013
Look, it's not my usual job.

02:46.706 --> 02:49.240
So let me know when the crew shows up.

02:53.442 --> 02:54.200
Hey.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.127
Trying to keep the Newport Group afloat while Kirsten's gone?

02:58.215 --> 02:59.781
That and everything else.

03:00.615 --> 03:03.447
I haven't exactly been making life easier for you, I know.

03:03.514 --> 03:05.198
It's not me I'm worried about, kid.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.515
It's you.

03:08.102 --> 03:09.207
Why don't you sit down?

03:10.083 --> 03:11.999
I understand everything you've been through this summer,

03:12.045 --> 03:14.988
what with your brother and Marissa, and now school.

03:18.079 --> 03:19.810
You have to move past all that.

03:19.893 --> 03:21.059
I am. I want to.

03:21.110 --> 03:22.248
I don't think you do.

03:23.610 --> 03:26.101
Those kids at Harbor, Ryan, are no better than you,

03:26.301 --> 03:28.545
but they're working towards their future, and you're sitting here.

03:28.606 --> 03:29.974
Well, I don't want to be.

03:31.192 --> 03:33.193
- I... I just...
- You couldn't help slugging the dean.

03:33.234 --> 03:34.511
He had his hands on Marissa.

03:34.571 --> 03:35.811
Which is wrong.

03:35.904 --> 03:39.564
You got to stop thinking about Marissa Cooper and start thinking about yourself.

03:40.926 --> 03:43.143
I think you should stop seeing her for a while.

03:43.282 --> 03:46.180
Oh, come on, Sandy. Let's not overreact here.

03:46.225 --> 03:49.332
I'm not saying break up. I'm saying take some time apart

03:49.737 --> 03:52.702
until you get out of this hole you've dug for yourself.

04:06.874 --> 04:08.016
Hey, sweetie.

04:08.050 --> 04:08.736
Hey.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.293
I have really good news. I wanted to tell you in person.

04:11.901 --> 04:14.108
Mmm, I need some good news.

04:14.203 --> 04:17.416
I have been on the phone all morning with Kaitlin's boarding school.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.096
They've agreed to take you.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.719
Boarding school?

04:20.774 --> 04:24.497
Apparently, the more elite the institution, the more accepting they are of criminals.

04:24.559 --> 04:27.432
- Not that you're technically...
- No way! I'm not going.

04:27.493 --> 04:30.508
But, honey, you get a fresh start where nobody knows you.

04:30.568 --> 04:34.819
I mean, nobody but your sister, and I've agreed to up her allowance to keep her quiet.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.093
- I don't care who knows.
- Well, you should.

04:37.154 --> 04:38.730
You need to get back on track.

04:38.803 --> 04:41.711
Or did you think you'd just spend a year hanging out with Ryan, ruining your life?

04:41.768 --> 04:46.574
No. I thought I was going to spend it here with you and Dad, getting our family back together.

04:47.599 --> 04:48.884
Oh, honey.

04:52.447 --> 04:57.583
Okay, I won't force you to go to boarding school, but you have to promise me one thing.

04:58.033 --> 04:58.761
What?

04:58.826 --> 05:00.399
You have to stay away from Ryan.

05:01.202 --> 05:03.404
Mom, this is not his fault!

05:03.446 --> 05:06.431
Marissa, I gave you your independence, and look where you ended up--

05:06.481 --> 05:09.134
barely escaping jail and kicked out of school.

05:09.399 --> 05:10.870
You need to listen to me.

05:10.972 --> 05:12.830
Let me and your father handle this.

05:12.958 --> 05:14.100
I told you.

05:14.279 --> 05:15.523
I'll handle it.

05:15.595 --> 05:16.911
You'll get your money.

05:17.178 --> 05:19.696
Everything's under control.

05:27.197 --> 05:27.899
Jimmy.

05:27.966 --> 05:29.450
Hey. Sandy.

05:30.265 --> 05:33.618
So, these past couple of weeks have been pretty crazy.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.969
No one's been thinking straight. I know... I know I haven't.

05:36.029 --> 05:39.430
And I just wanted to say, on behalf of my whole family,

05:40.217 --> 05:41.334
I'm sorry.

05:41.569 --> 05:42.794
I appreciate that.

05:43.208 --> 05:43.782
Thanks.

05:43.833 --> 05:44.698
Come on in.

05:46.010 --> 05:51.222
You know, uh... this is kind of awkward, 'cause it's not the only reason why I came over.

05:51.994 --> 05:55.082
Julie and I have been living in limbo for the past couple of months.

05:55.123 --> 05:57.002
I mean, it's not that, you know, we need the money...

05:57.068 --> 05:59.460
You want to know when the lawyers are going to read Caleb's will.

05:59.684 --> 06:02.124
If you... if you don't mind making a phone call.

06:04.107 --> 06:06.187
Is there anything I... I need to know?

06:06.249 --> 06:09.587
Oh, well, no, no. I mean, no. Are you kidding? No.

06:09.642 --> 06:13.878
It's fantastic. I just want to give my fiancÃ©e a little peace of mind. That's all.

06:13.943 --> 06:16.996
Well, anything for the soon-to-be Mrs. Cooper-Nichol-Cooper.

06:20.738 --> 06:23.759
You know, isn't it a little immature of seniors to be giving wedgies?

06:24.327 --> 06:25.838
They were sophomores.

06:26.370 --> 06:29.571
- Large, bitter sophomores.
- Oh, honey.

06:29.626 --> 06:31.373
- Oh, God. Don't look.
- What?

06:31.475 --> 06:34.582
- Just don't look.
- Hey. Glad I found you two.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.741
What do you think about helping with the school's production of South Pacific?

06:37.803 --> 06:39.401
Ooh! I'm all for that.

06:40.952 --> 06:42.600
Oh, you meant us helping?

06:42.822 --> 06:45.591
Well, considering I happen to know for a fact you two were responsible

06:45.621 --> 06:48.186
for Marissa Cooper crashing the carnival,

06:48.259 --> 06:51.838
the least you can do is offer to be stagehands for the drama club.

06:51.884 --> 06:52.917
No way. Okay?

06:52.978 --> 06:56.630
I will join the synchronized swim team, do rhythmic gymnastics, shot put,

06:56.672 --> 06:59.974
collect stamps, march for women's rights, free animals from the laboratories.

07:00.019 --> 07:04.053
You know, I will even read comic books with Cohen and his whack pack of social maladjusts.

07:04.109 --> 07:05.897
But drama club? No.

07:05.964 --> 07:08.478
See, Taylor Townsend is the president and...

07:10.438 --> 07:12.507
Suddenly this all makes sense.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.774
Oh, we'd be stagehands and Taylor would be...

07:14.837 --> 07:17.781
The director-- that's correct-- and writer.

07:17.847 --> 07:20.233
I'm pretty sure Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote South Pacific.

07:20.284 --> 07:22.963
Well, I changed some lyrics, cut a character.

07:23.018 --> 07:26.530
It was just such a good musical, it made me wish it were better.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.732
That sounds awesome. It does. Yeah.

07:28.784 --> 07:30.724
But you know what? I think that we're really busy, right?

07:30.766 --> 07:33.489
Totally booked up, and I'm tired just thinking about it.

07:35.419 --> 07:38.378
Well, it is purely voluntary, of course.

07:38.451 --> 07:43.085
But, unless you want to join Ryan and Marissa in the streets,

07:43.150 --> 07:46.096
I'd think about showing a little Harbor School spirit.

07:56.652 --> 07:58.394
Wow! Hello.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.401
Let's get married.

07:59.473 --> 08:03.651
Okay. The part where you propose and I say yes already happened.

08:03.702 --> 08:04.911
No, no, no. Like right now.

08:04.967 --> 08:09.632
I mean, not right now, but as soon as possible. Like... like Saturday.

08:09.658 --> 08:11.126
What can we pull together in under a week?

08:11.182 --> 08:15.811
Come on. 200 strangers, a DJ playing Kool and the Gang. Who needs it?

08:15.933 --> 08:20.153
Just the family, close friends. We... we could do it here.

08:20.993 --> 08:26.140
Tasteful, understated, maybe a breakfast thing, mimosas, a chef making custom omelets...

08:26.185 --> 08:29.318
- I like it.
- Yeah. I'll call Reverend Donahue.

08:32.047 --> 08:33.357
And then the honeymoon.

08:33.455 --> 08:34.629
Stock up the boat,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.405
sail off right after the ceremony.

08:37.470 --> 08:39.855
Two weeks in Hawaii. That'll get our heads straight.

08:40.167 --> 08:43.916
Then we can, uh... come back to reality.

08:44.212 --> 08:46.737
Oh, Jimmy, what are we going to do?

08:46.885 --> 08:49.516
Marissa begged me not to go to boarding school.

08:49.649 --> 08:53.013
I've called every school within a 50-mile radius, and let me tell you something--

08:53.069 --> 08:54.462
they all read the paper.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.731
I just wish there were a way to keep the family together

08:56.788 --> 08:59.347
and give Marissa the clean slate she deserves.

08:59.413 --> 09:03.137
Things won't seem so bad when we're anchored in Hanalei Bay.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.909
James, what is your opinion on the educational system in Kauai?

09:18.035 --> 09:19.642
Kirsten said she'll be right out.

09:19.863 --> 09:20.912
We weren't expecting you.

09:21.891 --> 09:22.904
Is everything okay?

09:22.971 --> 09:24.553
Yeah. Fine, thanks.

09:28.305 --> 09:31.741
Okay. Well, I'll let you have some privacy.

09:35.683 --> 09:38.243
Honey... What are you doing here?

09:40.779 --> 09:42.656
Not that it isn't great to see you.

09:42.728 --> 09:45.238
Oh, it's official business, I'm afraid.

09:47.539 --> 09:50.122
They're reading Caleb's will on Friday.

09:52.053 --> 09:53.041
What's wrong?

09:53.305 --> 09:56.861
It's just I've worked so hard to put my dad behind me, and...

09:58.243 --> 10:00.076
Do I have to decide right now? Can I think about it?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.801
Of course. Yeah.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.290
Whatever you need to get better.

10:04.801 --> 10:06.343
I've got to tell you, though,

10:07.762 --> 10:11.790
at Suriak, you seemed a lot more positive.

10:11.843 --> 10:15.011
Reality is a little more complicated than they tell you at Suriak.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.597
Says who? Charlotte.

10:18.914 --> 10:21.832
I've seen her on the verge of relapse, Sandy.

10:21.918 --> 10:24.217
She has these stories about how you think you've hit bottom,

10:24.273 --> 10:28.558
and then you find a new low to sink to.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.693
Oh, honey, it sounds like she's trying to scare you.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.352
She's just being honest.

10:34.745 --> 10:36.224
Sandy...

10:36.665 --> 10:42.010
Mmm. All right. Let me know what you want to do about the will.

10:56.144 --> 10:57.686
You should probably go.

10:57.813 --> 11:00.119
Because if my mom finds you here, she'll kill you.

11:00.189 --> 11:01.772
Not if Sandy kills me first.

11:04.415 --> 11:05.664
- Marissa?
- Hide.

11:08.823 --> 11:09.586
Hide!

11:13.093 --> 11:14.895
Oh. What, Mom?

11:15.582 --> 11:17.306
We don't have locked doors in this house.

11:17.384 --> 11:19.103
Sorry. I didn't know it was.

11:19.359 --> 11:21.388
So... what's up?

11:22.729 --> 11:25.601
Your father and I have decided to move the wedding up to Saturday.

11:25.657 --> 11:26.467
Okay, great.

11:26.534 --> 11:28.228
And then we were thinking of Hawaii.

11:28.325 --> 11:29.632
Oh, always a classic choice.

11:29.702 --> 11:32.370
Well, we thought we'd take the whole family, you and your sister.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.193
Okay, I'm happy to work on my tan.

11:34.254 --> 11:38.013
And then we thought... we'd... sort of, stay there.

11:39.052 --> 11:41.058
- What do you mean?
- A fresh start.

11:41.811 --> 11:43.234
For the whole family.

11:43.435 --> 11:45.948
Put Newport and all of our history behind us.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.725
A new life.

11:47.975 --> 11:51.964
What? No. Okay. Mom, we can't. I can't.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.094
You can, and you will.

11:55.637 --> 11:59.567
After the wedding on Saturday, the Coopers are moving to Kawaihae.

12:12.578 --> 12:13.760
Okay, how about this?

12:13.837 --> 12:15.403
You and Marissa run away together.

12:15.491 --> 12:17.381
Uh, last time I tried to run away...

12:17.458 --> 12:19.285
We were ambushed by the cops. Got it.

12:19.351 --> 12:21.439
I guess you're not up for the model home idea either.

12:21.506 --> 12:25.310
Uh, I thought we might be able to start with something that didn't involve me getting arrested.

12:25.394 --> 12:28.251
Is it my fault that most of our half-baked adolescent schemes

12:28.297 --> 12:30.714
go hopelessly awry and my dad has to bail us out?

12:30.764 --> 12:32.091
Usually, yeah.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.106
- Okay, uh... new shape.
- Thank you.

12:35.157 --> 12:37.334
Coopers are moving to Hawaii. You move there also,

12:37.370 --> 12:41.235
get a job as a scuba instructor and/or work on a macadamia nut farm.

12:41.301 --> 12:42.494
I love macadamia nuts.

12:42.545 --> 12:44.148
What if Marissa moved in here?

12:44.822 --> 12:46.550
I think the nut farm has a better shot.

12:46.581 --> 12:48.787
Why not? Marissa should be in Newport for her senior year, right,

12:48.843 --> 12:50.584
wherever we end up going to school?

12:50.645 --> 12:53.523
We got plenty of room. Kirsten and Sandy are like the Cooper's oldest friends.

12:53.574 --> 12:55.816
And Julie Cooper's not exactly your biggest fan.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.946
Where's Sandy?

12:58.033 --> 13:00.522
My mom's office. Ryan, he's never going to go for that, man.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.170
He doesn't even want you seeing Marissa.

13:03.762 --> 13:05.442
Fine, you're gonna need ammo.

13:08.627 --> 13:09.528
Thank you.

13:10.608 --> 13:13.010
You can't leave. I won't let you.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.587
I know.

13:14.893 --> 13:17.091
Well, no, I really mean that I won't let you.

13:17.157 --> 13:22.456
I'll restrain you if I have to. You may be tall, but I am wiry and I have Ryan on my side.

13:22.533 --> 13:24.933
Except Ryan's part of the reason they want me to leave.

13:25.001 --> 13:27.104
Whatever. You got out of going to boarding school.

13:27.172 --> 13:29.989
Well, because I really didn't want to go to boarding school.

13:30.055 --> 13:32.891
So what are you saying? That you really want to go to Hawaii?

13:32.958 --> 13:38.457
No. No, it's just the best we can do if our family wants to stay together.

13:41.292 --> 13:47.207
Hey, it's just... for the first time, like, ever, my parents are actually happy.

13:47.831 --> 13:50.288
They've been given a second chance and,

13:50.396 --> 13:54.901
as crazy as it might sound, I think I want to be a part of that.

14:03.514 --> 14:04.380
Wow.

14:05.204 --> 14:07.047
What's gotten into you, Jimmy?

14:07.134 --> 14:09.484
You've been tense for weeks and now you're acting like a new man.

14:09.550 --> 14:12.432
Well, I just feel like we're finally moving forward.

14:13.585 --> 14:16.769
The will's being read tomorrow, we're getting married.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.698
Ooh. Speaking of which!

14:19.816 --> 14:22.878
I-I-I told the caterer I'd meet him like five minutes ago.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.195
We're tabling a motion, turkey sausage or pork.

14:26.302 --> 14:27.486
Why not both?

14:27.952 --> 14:28.991
Why not?

14:30.051 --> 14:30.895
Oh...

14:34.900 --> 14:36.691
Oop. Hi. Hello, there.

14:41.309 --> 14:43.685
- That the missus?
- Soon to be.

14:45.258 --> 14:47.961
Looks like this story's gonna have a happy ending.

14:48.371 --> 14:49.994
Didn't believe me on the phone?

14:50.081 --> 14:53.485
You've been saying the same thing this whole time. Why would I believe you now?

14:53.645 --> 14:55.282
Because now it's true.

14:55.753 --> 14:59.660
You're going to have all your money tomorrow night. Every... every dime.

14:59.727 --> 15:01.247
That's all I wanted to hear.

15:06.065 --> 15:08.482
You're a good guy, Jimmy. I'm rooting for you.

15:08.891 --> 15:11.621
But I got to tell you this, as clear as I can--

15:11.995 --> 15:13.244
this is it.

15:15.891 --> 15:16.852
See you tomorrow night.

15:22.424 --> 15:23.406
I brought you something.

15:23.495 --> 15:25.992
Is it a three-point plan about how you're going to keep your grades up,

15:26.038 --> 15:28.224
graduate on time and get into a great college?

15:28.298 --> 15:30.303
It's a bagel, toasted with cream cheese.

15:32.495 --> 15:33.995
I'm sorry about yesterday.

15:34.399 --> 15:36.376
I assume you're here for more than breakfast.

15:36.459 --> 15:40.072
I don't know if you heard, but the Coopers are moving to Hawaii.

15:40.728 --> 15:41.860
The Coopers?

15:42.501 --> 15:46.652
I was thinking maybe Marissa could stay here and live with us.

15:46.744 --> 15:48.492
You got a lot of nerve even to bring that up.

15:48.541 --> 15:52.842
Look, I get it, all right? I don't want to be here, asking you this, but...

15:54.301 --> 15:58.136
but I care about this girl and I can't just stand by

15:58.192 --> 16:02.499
and watch as she's dragged off to some island by her paranoid mom.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.189
You and I are both here because somebody gave us a break.

16:07.798 --> 16:09.948
Well, now Marissa needs one.

16:15.214 --> 16:16.363
Well...

16:19.359 --> 16:22.333
I think having Kirsten gone is making me all sentimental,

16:22.406 --> 16:25.580
or maybe my brain is fried from doing all these real estate deals.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.714
Your plan poses a myriad of obstacles.

16:28.764 --> 16:30.383
Anything you could do. Thank you.

16:41.838 --> 16:43.509
- Hey!
- Hey.

16:43.583 --> 16:47.007
I was just thinking about you, about seeing you on Friday.

16:47.079 --> 16:48.099
So you're gonna come?

16:48.124 --> 16:51.471
Yeah, well, I'm not exactly looking forward to it,

16:51.584 --> 16:54.048
the... the will part, I mean, but...

16:54.533 --> 16:57.340
I think it's important for me to be there, and, uh...

16:57.421 --> 16:58.528
I think I can handle it.

16:58.598 --> 17:00.637
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

17:00.877 --> 17:04.809
Is there any chance you might, you might want to stay after that?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.627
Let's see how it goes.

17:08.823 --> 17:09.776
Bye, honey.

17:09.863 --> 17:10.866
I'll see you soon.

17:13.621 --> 17:15.413
So you're going to the reading of the will?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.137
Sorry. I overheard.

17:17.656 --> 17:19.729
I think it's the right thing to do.

17:20.612 --> 17:22.670
Right for you or your husband?

17:22.991 --> 17:26.656
Sandy supports whatever I decide. 
He offered to go in my place.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.246
Then maybe it's your father you're trying to please?

17:30.332 --> 17:32.216
Well, it's a little late for that.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.629
I'm not going for him.

17:38.172 --> 17:39.733
I'm going for me.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.693
I feel great.

17:44.587 --> 17:45.431
Okay.

17:45.564 --> 17:49.062
Just, please promise me you'll sleep on it.

17:53.183 --> 17:56.864
Okay, left. No, not stage left, my left.

17:56.930 --> 17:58.907
Okay, this way, towards me.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.285
More.

18:00.699 --> 18:02.005
Less.

18:02.487 --> 18:04.530
A little more.

18:04.641 --> 18:06.338
A little less.

18:06.422 --> 18:09.690
And a little less, and a little less.

18:09.717 --> 18:11.180
Okay, that is good.

18:12.894 --> 18:14.636
I was just about to say that.

18:14.708 --> 18:18.164
Oh... I love the Tonganese beach set.

18:18.242 --> 18:20.109
It's so romantic.

18:20.714 --> 18:23.090
Good job, Summer. Seth.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.523
Seth?

18:24.600 --> 18:27.139
I think I nailed my shirt to the wall.

18:27.216 --> 18:29.449
He's a little disabled when it comes to handling tools.

18:29.515 --> 18:31.399
Summer, it's "specially abled."

18:32.920 --> 18:36.750
You know... it is so great that you guys have each other.

18:36.806 --> 18:38.557
- Thanks.
- Yes, thank you.

18:39.028 --> 18:41.756
Because, I mean, everyone knows that Marissa was the popular one,

18:41.814 --> 18:45.955
an-and, Seth, no judgment, but it's not like you got any cooler over the last two years.

18:46.012 --> 18:49.658
I mean, everyone just acted that way, 'cause they were afraid of Ryan Atwood.

18:50.036 --> 18:53.662
I mean, even as a senior, you're still pretty much the biggest geek in Newport.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.837
Oh, no. All right, listen, skank.

18:55.930 --> 18:59.073
Just because you're saying really mean things, in, like, a really nice voice,

18:59.139 --> 19:02.565
doesn't mean that we don't realize that you're just some stupid little skank.

19:03.486 --> 19:07.076
Seth? Summer? We couldn't possibly be having a problem here?

19:07.131 --> 19:11.572
Oh, no. No, Dean Hess, there's-there's, um, there's no problem.

19:11.811 --> 19:13.721
Everything is just super.

19:16.129 --> 19:18.377
This is your idea of school spirit?

19:18.759 --> 19:22.381
One more incident and there'll be consequences.

19:26.639 --> 19:28.294
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:38.671 --> 19:39.922
How you doing?

19:40.397 --> 19:42.569
I think I'm still in shock.

19:42.671 --> 19:44.600
I can't believe this is really happening.

19:44.697 --> 19:47.080
What would you say if I told you you didn't have to?

19:47.171 --> 19:49.123
I'd say, what are you talking about?

19:49.199 --> 19:53.131
I talked to Sandy and I asked him if you could stay here with us.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.923
It took him a bit to get there, but he said he'd be able to help us.

20:01.810 --> 20:02.957
What's wrong?

20:03.556 --> 20:06.427
It means the world to me that you would do that.

20:07.241 --> 20:08.348
But?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.488
But...

20:11.307 --> 20:14.134
My parents are together now and...

20:14.733 --> 20:17.475
I think we have a chance to be a real family.

20:17.544 --> 20:18.281
Okay.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.386
So...

20:21.993 --> 20:23.467
I'm sorry.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.997
I don't know. Marissa sounds pretty upset.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.938
And now I don't know what to do.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.145
Well, there's nothing you can do except be there for her

20:36.196 --> 20:38.740
and wrap your head around the whole long-distance thing.

20:38.817 --> 20:41.111
Yeah, hook you up with a little webcam action.

20:41.178 --> 20:42.627
You can start your own blog.

20:42.693 --> 20:45.791
Keep her updated daily on the innermost workings of Ryan Atwood.

20:45.873 --> 20:48.217
And until then, it seems like all I do

20:48.263 --> 20:50.219
is make her feel even worse than she already does.

20:50.271 --> 20:52.349
So think of something special to do before she leaves.

20:52.402 --> 20:54.208
Yeah, that way she has something to remember you

20:54.255 --> 20:57.715
by when she's surrounded by hot native dudes and lonely sailors.

20:58.862 --> 21:00.834
Not that that's gonna happen.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.367
Listen, I'm gonna see your mom in a few hours. Is there anything you want me to pass along?

21:04.418 --> 21:06.338
Could you ask her if she's ever coming home?

21:06.523 --> 21:09.901
If we push too hard and it doesn't work out, we'll only have ourselves to blame.

21:09.958 --> 21:12.088
Yeah, well, maybe if we don't push at all, we'll never see her again.

21:12.149 --> 21:15.758
You know, the situation's a little too complicated for those snide comments.

21:19.661 --> 21:21.466
Maybe I took that a beat too far.

21:21.909 --> 21:25.850
Come on, give me a ride to school. I'll help you think of something for Marissa.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.638
Well, you look nice.

21:29.890 --> 21:31.103
Oh, thanks.

21:32.246 --> 21:34.508
I, uh, I decided to go after all.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.895
Well, why don't I drive you?

21:36.106 --> 21:39.628
I mean, I can wait in the car and then we can stop in Palm Springs for lunch on the way back.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.051
I ordered a car.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.354
I think I just need to go alone.

21:45.843 --> 21:48.030
You're right. Have a great time.

21:48.097 --> 21:50.180
And it's just a bunch of bureaucratic stuff--

21:50.247 --> 21:52.402
who gets what property, bank accounts...

21:52.495 --> 21:53.979
It really won't affect me.

21:54.056 --> 21:55.679
Yeah, but from what you've told me about your dad,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.976
I'd be willing to bet he's planned a surprise for you.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.768
I just hope it's a good one.

22:10.626 --> 22:12.477
Who came up with that plan, Cohen?

22:12.606 --> 22:13.902
I did, why? Does it suck?

22:13.962 --> 22:16.308
- No, I think it's freaking romantic.
- So you're in?

22:16.360 --> 22:18.085
I also think it's really dangerous.

22:18.141 --> 22:18.858
So you're not in?

22:18.920 --> 22:23.584
No, I'm in. I'm just saying, there's heavy security, spies in our midst.

22:23.661 --> 22:25.873
Like, I'm not even going to tell you what would happen if we were caught.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.894
Caught doing what?

22:29.242 --> 22:31.831
Talking, while we should be painting.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.914
God, shut up, Cohen! Your incessant chatter keeps messing me up.

22:34.986 --> 22:38.898
Yeah, that seagull kind of looks like it's got fins.

22:39.645 --> 22:41.571
That's because it's a dolphin.

22:41.636 --> 22:43.250
Make it a seagull.

22:45.753 --> 22:46.542
All right.

22:46.772 --> 22:50.586
Black ops maneuvers commence at 2100 hours. Synchronize your watch.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.646
Hey, I thought this was my plan.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.868
Fine. What do you want to do?

22:54.376 --> 22:56.363
That 2100 thing sounded pretty cool,

22:56.429 --> 22:58.835
and then we're gonna synchronize our watches.

22:59.209 --> 23:00.610
We have to get watches.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.479
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hey, Jimmy, Julie.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.805
You remember my wife?

23:05.533 --> 23:07.949
Kiki, my gosh.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.869
I didn't know we were going to see you.

23:10.203 --> 23:12.409
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.138
- You look fantastic.
- Well, thank you.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.674
Yeah, maybe I should check myself into rehab.

23:17.378 --> 23:18.546
Sorry I'm late.

23:18.797 --> 23:21.173
- Let's get started, shall we?
- Great.

23:28.905 --> 23:33.671
Caleb Nichol was a very generous man who loved his family very much.

23:33.724 --> 23:38.428
Sandy gave a very nice eulogy at the funeral, so let's just skip the niceties, okay?

23:38.654 --> 23:44.440
Caleb's wish was to split his fortune equally between his daughters and his wife.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.807
Wow, that's... that's very generous.

23:47.859 --> 23:48.836
I'm getting the same as Kirsten?

23:48.877 --> 23:51.126
As I said, that was Caleb's intention.

23:51.131 --> 23:53.415
And that's all that matters, right?

23:55.447 --> 23:57.148
What is it, Mr. Frankle?

23:57.362 --> 24:01.428
After careful scrutiny of his account, it has become clear that Caleb Nichol was broke.

24:01.940 --> 24:04.106
Broke? What's broke?

24:04.327 --> 24:09.907
Caleb had a series of high-interest loans, two mortgages on the house, back taxes.

24:10.926 --> 24:11.956
What about the business?

24:12.006 --> 24:14.212
Why do you think he was borrowing so much money?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.625
He asked me to give this to you.

24:25.918 --> 24:26.645
What is it?

24:26.696 --> 24:30.249
A personal letter. He, uh, sent it to me the day he died.

24:39.906 --> 24:40.770
Honey?

24:41.752 --> 24:43.648
Excuse me a minute. Kirsten, where you going?

24:46.012 --> 24:47.043
What about me?

24:47.135 --> 24:50.585
I mean, where's-where's my letter?

24:51.236 --> 24:53.965
Are you saying that-that I don't get anything? I mean, I don't...

24:54.006 --> 24:55.582
I don't believe this. Jimmy, do something.

24:57.790 --> 24:58.752
Jimmy?

24:59.544 --> 25:00.559
What are you doing?

25:00.749 --> 25:02.203
I should never have come here today.

25:02.275 --> 25:03.682
Charlotte told me this would happen.

25:03.759 --> 25:05.490
What? Wh-What's happened?

25:05.551 --> 25:08.050
This letter, Sandy. What do you think this is?

25:08.091 --> 25:11.224
Well I don't know. Let's open it together, we'll find out.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.116
He wrote this after our fight. After I told him he was going to die alone.

25:15.188 --> 25:17.871
I told him every problem our family ever had was because of him.

25:17.916 --> 25:21.818
That my drinking was because of him. Could you imagine what he wrote me back?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.300
I can't be here right now.

25:25.334 --> 25:28.336
Wait a minute. Wait, honey. Wait, wait, come on.

25:28.869 --> 25:30.266
Kirsten, don't.

25:31.043 --> 25:32.068
Come on.

25:45.001 --> 25:45.790
Hey.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.908
Hey. I didn't think I'd see you today.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.978
Why would you think that?

25:50.501 --> 25:52.630
Because it's kind of depressing around here.

25:52.734 --> 25:55.723
And I thought you might be mad at me.

25:55.799 --> 25:59.506
Well, I'm not. If anyone understands trying to keep a family together...

25:59.633 --> 26:02.354
It's just, I don't want you to feel like I'm leaving.

26:02.584 --> 26:07.053
I mean, I am leaving, but I'm not leaving you.

26:08.651 --> 26:14.145
What's important right now is that you and I have the best 24 hours of our lives together.

26:14.508 --> 26:16.071
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:16.157 --> 26:19.081
So, come on. We're going to, uh, maybe head down by the pier,

26:19.132 --> 26:23.960
meet Seth and Summer, chili cheese fries, those black and white milkshakes Summer likes...

26:24.902 --> 26:27.880
Sure. The diner sounds great.

26:35.747 --> 26:40.805
You know, Jimmy, when I think about it, I sort of talked myself into loving Caleb.

26:42.607 --> 26:45.730
Not for the money, but for the security that money brings.

26:47.236 --> 26:49.459
But I never felt safe with him,

26:50.539 --> 26:52.204
the way I do with you.

26:53.448 --> 26:55.935
And besides, it's not like we're gonna be poor, right?

26:56.011 --> 27:01.162
I mean, you have your business in Hawaii, and we'll be sailing into town on a 100-foot yacht.

27:01.270 --> 27:02.416
Aloha.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.595
You know, darn, I-I completely forgot this...

27:13.133 --> 27:13.573
What?

27:13.634 --> 27:15.841
This last minute stuff, about the, uh...

27:16.753 --> 27:17.638
the boat.

27:18.227 --> 27:21.187
Well, okay, then I'll see you at home?

27:22.144 --> 27:26.839
Oh, you know, actually, honey, um... it's bad luck...

27:26.958 --> 27:29.010
to spend the night before the wedding with the bride.

27:29.077 --> 27:32.729
So I'll-I'll meet you here. Tomorrow, okay?

27:32.780 --> 27:35.832
Okay. I had no idea you were so traditional.

27:36.378 --> 27:38.293
All right, then, I'll see you tomorrow.

27:38.379 --> 27:39.173
Okay.

27:41.338 --> 27:42.092
Bye.

27:47.043 --> 27:47.707
Hello?

27:47.802 --> 27:49.614
Charlotte, hi. It's Sandy Cohen.

27:49.742 --> 27:50.776
Sandy, hi.

27:50.873 --> 27:53.054
Hi. Is, uh... is Kirsten there?

27:53.126 --> 27:55.465
No. I expected her hours ago.

27:55.706 --> 27:56.904
Is everything okay?

27:57.708 --> 28:00.673
Well, I, uh... I don't think so.

28:00.739 --> 28:03.458
She's not answering her cell. And if she's not with you...

28:04.620 --> 28:06.423
I don't know where she is.

28:06.761 --> 28:08.004
Any ideas?

28:10.794 --> 28:13.263
She didn't want to go today, Sandy.

28:13.918 --> 28:19.361
She told me how scared she was. She was afraid that the stress would cause her to relapse.

28:19.606 --> 28:21.418
But she didn't want to let you down.

28:22.438 --> 28:24.475
Well, if you hear anything, would you let me know?

28:24.557 --> 28:25.499
Sure.

28:25.883 --> 28:26.867
Thank you.

28:31.928 --> 28:34.803
- Well, that was just delicious.
- Mmm, mmm.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.383
Who's tired? What is it, like, God, midnight?

28:37.450 --> 28:38.392
It's, like, 8:30.

28:38.474 --> 28:40.773
Oh! Ooh, that's past my bedtime.

28:40.865 --> 28:41.977
- We should get going.
- Okay.

28:42.084 --> 28:44.286
Wait, but I haven't finished my food yet.

28:45.746 --> 28:47.536
You guys are up to something.

28:47.635 --> 28:48.499
What?

28:48.776 --> 28:51.883
No, not at all, but we are out of here, you know, sweetie? See you at the wedding.

28:51.955 --> 28:53.640
Ryan, I'll call you before, man.

28:55.877 --> 28:59.804
Well... So there's, um... a little something.

29:01.258 --> 29:02.109
Follow me.

29:06.815 --> 29:08.487
- I'm peeking.
- No, you're not. No.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.931
- Yes, I am. I can see. Ow.
- No, no, no.

29:10.987 --> 29:12.748
- Come on, where are we?
- Hey.

29:12.948 --> 29:14.647
I'm scared. Really.

29:17.935 --> 29:18.978
Whoa.

29:21.175 --> 29:22.573
Did you do all this?

29:22.610 --> 29:25.481
I had some help, but, uh... yeah.

29:25.568 --> 29:26.495
Do you like it?

29:27.544 --> 29:29.527
Yeah, I like it.

29:29.981 --> 29:31.488
You want to know how much?

29:48.974 --> 29:50.534
- Hey, Don.
- Hey, Jimmy.

29:50.785 --> 29:51.696
You're early.

29:52.192 --> 29:53.293
You got my money?

29:53.534 --> 29:56.944
Well, to be honest, I-I-I ran into some, uh,

29:57.528 --> 30:00.815
unexpected complications, and I... and I don't. I-I, uh...

30:01.635 --> 30:02.883
I don't have your money.

30:06.005 --> 30:10.154
Don... come on, what-what are we, gangsters or something?

30:10.214 --> 30:13.465
I mean, no. We're rational human beings. I mean...

30:13.589 --> 30:15.375
We're just two guys talking to each other.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.963
I'm not saying anything.

30:17.455 --> 30:19.206
Jimmy, I'm done talking.

30:23.015 --> 30:24.329
Get in the car.

30:29.856 --> 30:33.419
The car, huh? Well, I mean, uh, all right, yeah, I'll go for a ride.

30:33.492 --> 30:34.443
Jimmy...

30:35.149 --> 30:36.091
I'm sorry.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.116
Wait, stop.

31:00.366 --> 31:03.413
I'm sorry, but I can't do this. I have to go.

31:08.102 --> 31:10.898
What, you weren't even gonna try and stop me?

31:10.998 --> 31:12.020
Oh...

31:13.828 --> 31:16.515
- You are so not funny.
- I'm kind of funny.

31:24.318 --> 31:28.988
So... you sure you want to do this? 'Cause, uh...

31:30.161 --> 31:31.753
we've done a lot, but...

31:33.776 --> 31:35.030
not this.

31:39.453 --> 31:40.329
Yeah.

31:41.885 --> 31:44.419
You know it's gonna make it that much harder for you to leave.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.538
I know.

33:50.099 --> 33:51.345
Hello?

33:54.119 --> 33:55.190
What's wrong?

34:05.095 --> 34:05.948
Dad?

34:07.612 --> 34:08.844
Oh, my God.

34:08.952 --> 34:10.837
Hey, kiddo.

34:12.532 --> 34:13.551
What happened?

34:13.572 --> 34:19.627
Uh... I'm in trouble. I'm-I'm-I'm in real trouble, Marissa.

34:19.704 --> 34:22.295
I tried to fix it. I-I-I couldn't fix it.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.690
I gotta go and I can't, I can't take you with me.

34:25.772 --> 34:29.367
- Dad...
- Look, I've been a... terrible father.

34:32.038 --> 34:32.996
Marissa, I, uh...

34:33.058 --> 34:36.804
Dad, look, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in, but

34:36.893 --> 34:38.915
if you have to go, then go.

34:45.335 --> 34:48.648
But if you leave, then I don't want you to come back.

34:51.521 --> 34:54.377
It's too hard to keep saying good-bye like this.

35:04.333 --> 35:06.891
Hey, watch... watch the ribs there.

35:06.932 --> 35:07.541
Sorry.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.736
Is there anything I can do?

35:11.371 --> 35:12.677
Yeah, you can, uh...

35:14.259 --> 35:17.162
you could give this to your mom.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.197
I, uh... I don't know if it makes any difference, but...

35:28.441 --> 35:30.007
I really love her.

35:49.346 --> 35:51.727
Come on, let's go find your mom.

35:57.183 --> 35:58.491
Kirsten, thank God.

35:59.618 --> 36:00.605
Ms. Morgan?

36:01.235 --> 36:02.627
Uh, sorry to bother you.

36:02.705 --> 36:03.581
What is it?

36:03.714 --> 36:05.761
I don't know quite how to put this, but

36:05.812 --> 36:08.306
the family that owns this place has had a change in plans.

36:08.377 --> 36:10.665
They're returning sooner than expected.

36:10.851 --> 36:12.356
Tomorrow, actually.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.495
We have a deal. This place is mine for two more weeks.

36:14.567 --> 36:19.379
Well, that would be the case if your check had cleared, but since it didn't...

36:19.467 --> 36:23.902
How 'bout I charge you for the two weeks and you just... start packing?

36:25.719 --> 36:27.762
All right, let me, let me get you some cash.

36:40.726 --> 36:42.896
So you think you'll, uh, head back east?

36:42.979 --> 36:45.339
Actually, I thought I'd spend some time at the beach.

36:54.524 --> 36:55.599
I'm home.

36:57.519 --> 36:59.476
Oh, thank God you're all right.

37:06.633 --> 37:09.147
I'm so sorry I scared you.

37:09.511 --> 37:11.799
I think I even scared myself.

37:14.135 --> 37:14.963
Where were you?

37:15.035 --> 37:18.122
At a sleazy motel with a bottle of vodka...

37:18.957 --> 37:20.150
that I didn't drink.

37:21.732 --> 37:24.619
Sandy, I'm sick of hiding from my life.

37:25.091 --> 37:26.822
I want to live it again.

37:27.825 --> 37:29.530
If things get messy,

37:30.191 --> 37:31.839
we'll clean them up together.

37:38.670 --> 37:40.697
Can't do this without you.

37:41.494 --> 37:42.713
I'm right here.

38:12.569 --> 38:14.371
It's an apology.

38:20.003 --> 38:21.566
Oh, my Dad.

38:22.779 --> 38:25.882
Of course he'd have to be dead to say nice things.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.297
Oh, there you are, honey.

38:50.463 --> 38:51.993
Marissa, what's wrong?

38:52.779 --> 38:54.073
Where's your father?

39:02.990 --> 39:03.877
No.

39:06.796 --> 39:07.799
No.

39:10.319 --> 39:11.255
- Mom...
- Oh, my gosh.

39:11.317 --> 39:13.355
What am I gonna do? What are we gonna do?

39:14.614 --> 39:15.945
It'll be okay.

39:16.964 --> 39:18.736
We'll figure it out together.

39:19.964 --> 39:21.291
Like we always do.

39:24.045 --> 39:28.202
Well, Summer, I'd say our first foray into musical theater was a big success.

39:28.274 --> 39:32.319
Aww, honey, if I were you, I wouldn't say "foray," like, ever.

39:32.673 --> 39:34.535
- But we did good.
- Yeah.

39:34.597 --> 39:36.990
I'm gonna go get the tiki torches out of the car.

39:37.061 --> 39:37.746
Okay.

39:37.819 --> 39:42.144
I'm gonna stay here and... move things around till you get back.

39:42.397 --> 39:43.389
Like this.

39:45.438 --> 39:48.627
Seth Cohen... don't move.

39:49.150 --> 39:50.085
Dean.

39:53.568 --> 39:55.385
I never took you for a thief, Cohen.

39:55.451 --> 39:56.670
I didn't steal anything.

39:56.782 --> 40:00.045
I borrowed it for a very good reason.

40:00.551 --> 40:03.639
My father... loves musicals, okay?

40:03.710 --> 40:06.787
And you should actually think about opening up your auditions to parents,

40:06.839 --> 40:10.975
'cause his rendition of "Some Enchanted Evening," it's a treat.

40:11.036 --> 40:12.552
Wow. A thief and a liar.

40:12.624 --> 40:17.334
Okay, fine, listen. I borrowed a theatrical set, which I brought back unharmed,

40:17.401 --> 40:20.617
and I plan to reassemble immediately, okay? Talk about a victimless crime.

40:20.693 --> 40:22.675
It's the principle of the thing, Cohen.

40:22.762 --> 40:26.111
Trespassing, removing school property without permission.

40:26.221 --> 40:28.697
I'm the Dean of Discipline. I'm here to set examples.

40:28.779 --> 40:30.520
Well, then, I guess go ahead and expel me.

40:30.597 --> 40:33.064
At the rate you're going, the school's going to be empty by Thanksgiving.

40:33.136 --> 40:36.771
I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of a reunion with Ryan and Marissa.

40:37.390 --> 40:40.099
- I'm going to keep you here, with me.
- That's creepy.

40:40.165 --> 40:41.803
One month detention.

40:42.363 --> 40:46.790
Unless, maybe, I don't know, you want to give up your partner.

40:50.806 --> 40:53.319
'Cause I know you didn't do this all by yourself.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.195
Do you see anyone else here?

40:57.691 --> 41:00.989
I mean, I think it's pretty clear I acted alone.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.557
Then let's make it two months.

41:12.032 --> 41:13.512
I'm sorry about your dad.

41:14.029 --> 41:15.365
Yeah, well...

41:16.663 --> 41:19.236
It's like he just can't make it here anymore.

41:20.071 --> 41:21.976
I'm not mad, I just...

41:23.157 --> 41:25.284
I guess I'm just a little scared.

41:28.013 --> 41:29.625
I mean, what happens now?

41:29.815 --> 41:32.780
Ah, we stick together, things will be okay.

41:32.989 --> 41:33.778
Deal?

41:34.574 --> 41:35.483
Deal.

41:48.220 --> 41:50.387
And although it sucks that I got two weeks detention...

41:50.459 --> 41:51.682
I thought you said you got two months.

41:51.779 --> 41:55.072
That does suck. But I did the first brave thing in my whole life.

41:55.153 --> 41:57.099
I could have sold Summer out, but I didn't.

41:57.170 --> 41:59.387
Hmm, it's like you're becoming a man.

42:02.148 --> 42:03.993
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, what's up?

42:05.005 --> 42:06.345
Hey, guys.

42:07.098 --> 42:07.934
Hey.

42:11.706 --> 42:12.996
