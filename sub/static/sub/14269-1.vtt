01:19.880 --> 01:21.871
Hey. Mr. Sullivan.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.130
Now, I know a lot of you are wondering
about tomorrow night's show.

01:37.198 --> 01:42.192
Just who are these
youngsters from Liverpool
who call themselves the Beatles?

01:42.269 --> 01:45.796
Just what can we expect?
Well, let me put it in perspective for you.

01:45.873 --> 01:51.675
Now, here a few years ago,
we had a young vocalist up on our stage
by the name of Elvis Presley.

01:51.745 --> 01:55.977
He, a few of you may remember...
He caused quite a sensational reaction...

01:56.050 --> 01:58.712
among the youngsters
in our studio audience.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.879
Well, tomorrow night,
right here on our stage,

02:00.955 --> 02:05.790
we're gonna have
Elvis Presley times four!

02:05.860 --> 02:10.229
I don't get paid enough for...
All right. Simmer down.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.788
Simmer down, simmer down.

02:12.867 --> 02:17.930
All right. A few weeks ago
I went to England, and I saw
these four youngsters perform.

02:18.005 --> 02:22.567
Both Sylvia and I agreed that
what they do to an audience
is truly remarkable.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.670
So, I want you to be prepared for...

02:26.747 --> 02:29.944
excessive screaming, hysteria,

02:30.017 --> 02:32.485
hyperventilation, fainting,

02:32.553 --> 02:35.613
fits, seizures, spasmodic convulsions,

02:35.689 --> 02:39.955
even attempted suicides...
all perfectly normal.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.724
It merely means that these youngsters
are enjoying themselves.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.789
Now, I want you to remember
that tomorrow night...

02:46.867 --> 02:50.064
we're going out live, coast to coast,

02:50.137 --> 02:53.402
to 90 million viewers
in the United States and Canada.

02:53.474 --> 02:58.741
So remember, nothing must interfere
with our really big "shoe. "

03:05.619 --> 03:09.316
<i># Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something #</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:12.918
<i>#I think you'll understand #</i>

03:12.993 --> 03:16.258
<i># When I say that something #</i>

03:17.264 --> 03:20.722
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

03:20.801 --> 03:24.328
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

03:24.405 --> 03:27.238
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

03:27.308 --> 03:30.709
<i># Oh, please, say to me #</i>

03:31.712 --> 03:34.476
<i># You'll let me be your man #</i>

03:34.548 --> 03:37.813
<i>#And please, say to me #</i>

03:38.819 --> 03:42.448
<i># You'll let me hold your hand #</i>

03:42.523 --> 03:45.981
<i>#Now let me hold your hand #</i>

03:46.060 --> 03:49.029
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

03:50.030 --> 03:55.730
<i>#And when I touch you I feel happy inside #</i>

03:57.271 --> 04:01.605
<i>#It's such a feeling that my love #</i>

04:01.675 --> 04:05.270
<i>#I can't hide, I can't hide #</i>

04:05.346 --> 04:09.146
<i>#I can't hide #</i>

04:09.216 --> 04:12.617
<i># Yeah, you got that something #</i>

04:13.621 --> 04:16.317
<i>#I think you'll understand #</i>

04:16.390 --> 04:20.690
<i># When I say that something #</i>

04:21.695 --> 04:24.596
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

04:24.665 --> 04:28.260
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:31.162
<i># I want to hold your hand #</i>

04:32.306 --> 04:34.536
#And when I touch you #

04:34.608 --> 04:38.669
# I feel happy inside #

04:39.713 --> 04:43.376
<i>#It's such a feeling that my love #</i>

04:43.450 --> 04:47.147
<i>#I can't hide #</i>

04:47.221 --> 04:51.749
<i>#I can't hide, I can't hide #</i>

04:51.825 --> 04:55.693
<i># Yeah, you got that something #</i>

04:55.763 --> 04:59.563
<i>#I think you'll understand #</i>

04:59.633 --> 05:03.194
<i># When I feel that something #</i>

05:03.270 --> 05:07.104
<i>#I want to hold your hand #</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:10.735
# I want hold your hand #

05:10.811 --> 05:14.679
Rosie, I don't know why you're
dragging me in here. I can't be
spending any money on Beatle records.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.444
Hey, listen. Stereo.
Rosie, are you listening to me?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.509
Come on, Pam.
Rosie!

05:19.586 --> 05:23.386
<i>All right, baby, this is
Murray the "K"with the number one song...
Rosie, wait a minute.</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:25.448
<i>Excuse me.</i>

05:25.526 --> 05:29.587
Rosie, did you hear what I said?
I've gotta start saving my money
for more important things.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.064
I mean, for God's sakes,
tomorrow night I'm getting...
you know...

05:33.133 --> 05:36.500
All right, I'll buy it for you
as an elopement present.
Shh!

05:36.570 --> 05:39.198
Do you wanna tell the whole world?
Anyway, if you're gonna get me something,

05:39.273 --> 05:44.108
get me something practical
that I can use, like Tupperware.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.409
Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.449
<i>It's Paul! Oh, I'm gonna die!</i>

05:49.516 --> 05:52.610
<i>- Oh, my God! It's Paul! It's Paul!
- Rosie...</i>

05:52.686 --> 05:57.282
<i>- Oh, I'm gonna die right here!
He's so cute, so sexy!</i>

05:57.358 --> 06:00.816
<i>- He's cardboard.
- #I know you never #</i>

06:00.894 --> 06:04.261
<i>#Even try, girl #</i>

06:04.331 --> 06:06.765
<i>Yeah. Yeah, well, I know it is.</i>

06:06.834 --> 06:10.895
<i>Yeah.
The Beatles are fakes!</i>

06:10.971 --> 06:15.465
It's all a plot...
a plot to make you waste your money!
Don't fall for It!

06:15.542 --> 06:18.272
<i>Herb, lemme... lemme
call you back later, huh?
It's a gimmick!</i>

06:18.345 --> 06:21.712
Oh, you don't really wanna buy these albums.
You only think that you do.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.478
<i>Punch her out!</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:28.453
Rosie, you're not
buying another one.
It's not for me. It's for Pam.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.423
<i>Just to give away
two tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

06:31.492 --> 06:36.452
Did you hear me, baby?
If you can answer this question:
What's Ringo Starr's real name?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.930
Are you listening to me?
Did you hear what I said?
Ohh!

06:38.999 --> 06:41.695
<i>#Please please me, whoa, yeah #</i>

06:41.769 --> 06:44.761
<i>#Like I please you #
And right now...</i>

06:47.207 --> 06:50.370
<i>Janis, what are you doing?</i>

06:50.444 --> 06:54.107
You are picketing in my store.
You are driving my customers away.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.742
Why?
All I see around this store
is Beatle albums.

06:57.818 --> 07:02.482
What about Bob Dylan? Joan Baez?
How come they don't get
equal floor space?

07:02.556 --> 07:05.491
The Beatles sell.
"Jane" Baez doesn't sell.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.289
I deserve a little more respect
from my own daughter.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.263
You are embarrassing me.
I'm embarrassing you?

07:11.331 --> 07:14.630
I feel like I'm talking
to a walking publicity stunt.

07:14.701 --> 07:19.798
<i>Hey, Janis!
Janis, have you seen Rosie?</i>

07:21.408 --> 07:23.569
<i>Hey, just a reminder...
Rosie.</i>

07:23.644 --> 07:26.704
Rosie, that's your 12th busy signal!
You're not gonna get through!

07:26.780 --> 07:28.771
Rosie!

07:30.851 --> 07:33.285
Rosie, I got somethin' to tell ya,

07:33.353 --> 07:35.719
but I want you to promise me
that you're not gonna scream...

07:35.789 --> 07:38.349
<i>and you're not gonna yell
and you're not gonna faint.</i>

07:38.425 --> 07:41.792
<i>Oh, my God, Grace. What?
You promise?</i>

07:42.796 --> 07:47.290
I figured out a way
to get into the Beatles' hotel.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.335
Damn, Rosie! Control yourself!

07:49.403 --> 07:52.201
There's still a hitch.
We gotta raise $23.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.240
Twenty-three dollars?

07:54.308 --> 07:56.503
See, we have to hire a limo.
A limousine.

07:56.577 --> 08:01.071
It's the only thing that can pull up
to the front of the Beatles' hotel
without getting stopped by cops.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.811
How much money you got?
Uhh, I got three dollars
worth of dimes.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.615
That's not enough, Rosie. Damn!

08:07.688 --> 08:10.179
But it's enough to hire a cab.
We could drive up in a cab!

08:10.257 --> 08:12.748
No, I already found out.
The cops are checkin' the cabs.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.193
See, we need a limo,
and we need it tonight.
I mean, I got a deadline to meet.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.858
Yeah.
Tonight?
We can't go tonight.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.527
Aren't you guys forgetting
about something?

08:22.603 --> 08:26.733
Aren't you forgetting
about this?
Oh, yeah. That.

08:26.807 --> 08:31.005
This is my last night as a single woman.
We were gonna do something special.

08:31.078 --> 08:35.275
We were supposed to spend
the night at Rosie's, and it was gonna
be like my shower or something.

08:35.349 --> 08:40.048
Oh, hey, Pam, what could be better
than for all of us to drive up
to the Beatles' hotel together...

08:40.120 --> 08:44.614
and see the Beatles in person?
Yeah! Right, Pam.
How much money you got?

08:44.691 --> 08:48.559
I'm about to be a married woman.
I can't go chasing after the Beatles,
and...

08:48.629 --> 08:52.360
and it's not fair to Eddie.
Pam, I want you
to know something.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.026
You don't seem to understand
how important this is to me.

08:55.102 --> 08:59.766
I mean... I mean, I have got
to get through to the Beatles.
My entire career depends on it.

08:59.840 --> 09:05.142
<i>If I could get exclusive pictures of the Beatles,
I mean, they'd run my story on
the front page of The Suburban!</i>

09:05.212 --> 09:10.206
<i>I mean, I might even be able to sell it
to Life magazine or something.
Can you imagine that?</i>

09:10.284 --> 09:13.742
Jesus Christ.
Gonna suffocate in here.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.254
<i>Hey, Janis.</i>

09:16.323 --> 09:20.089
Hey, Janis, you got any money?
What do you want money for?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.618
Don't worry.
It's for a good cause.
Grace, there's Larry Dubois.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.458
So what?
So don't you know
who Larry Dubois is?

09:29.536 --> 09:32.164
Yes, I do. He's the boy
that threw up in biology.

09:32.239 --> 09:36.141
His father's got lots of limousines.
He's an undertaker.

09:46.386 --> 09:51.085
Hi, Larry. I didn't know
you played a musical instrument.
Yeah.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.626
You're so musical.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.924
This is ridiculous.
He'll never do it.

09:57.130 --> 10:01.590
Uh, Larry, are you busy tonight?
I don't know.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.368
He'll do it.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.440
<i># Oh, oh #</i>

10:12.512 --> 10:14.878
Ohh!
I just ran over a casket.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.781
What was it doing out
with the garbage?
Is that where it was?

10:17.851 --> 10:22.550
Uh-huh.
Ooh, sh... Oh, it's okay. It's one of those
discontinued models my father's throwin' out.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.558
You know, nobody was in it,
so the garbage man'll come
and pick it up.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.027
Jesus, Larry, didn't you
even take driver's ed,
for goodness sakes?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.863
I told you I didn't have
a driver's license.
All's I got is a permit.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.062
Look, Grace, we just better
turn around right now.

10:37.137 --> 10:41.130
It's against the law to drive
with a permit unless there is
a licensed driver in the car.

10:41.208 --> 10:45.645
I've got a license, Pamela.
You do? But, Grace, I thought
your birthday wasn't until...

10:45.712 --> 10:47.873
You know, I don't have
any insurance either.
Relax, Larry.

10:47.948 --> 10:52.976
Look, I have absolute confidence
in your ability to handle machinery.
Any kind of machinery.

10:53.053 --> 10:56.921
I mean, I've seen you threading up
those projectors in the A.V. Room.

10:56.990 --> 11:01.017
You're just the best.
Yeah, I'm pretty good
on those Bell & Howells.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.655
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:04.731 --> 11:07.359
Rosie, are we gonna have
to listen to the Beatles
all the way to the city?

11:07.434 --> 11:12.531
You know, I swear, Janis.
Every time something popular comes along,
you automatically think they can't be any good.

11:12.606 --> 11:16.201
- I don't know why we let her
come in the first place.
- She's helping to pay for the gas, Rosie.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.609
Besides, someone's gotta
be there to speak the truth.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.172
Say, Rosie, what do you
think of my new sign?

11:23.250 --> 11:27.084
<i>I think it's disgusting.
Who do you think's gonna
look at that anyways?</i>

11:27.154 --> 11:30.715
- The press, Rosie, the press.
- Hey, Larry, you like the Beatles, don't you?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.589
- Yeah, they're all right. They got a good beat.
- Oh, they're the greatest!

11:33.660 --> 11:35.924
- I mean, gearest. Here, have a jelly baby.
- A what?

11:35.996 --> 11:40.262
<i>Ajelly baby. You know, jelly beans.
They call 'em jelly babies in England.
It's the Beatles'favorite food.</i>

11:40.333 --> 11:43.860
<i>You know what their favorite drink is?
Coke, with a little bit of scotch.</i>

11:43.937 --> 11:48.101
<i>What am I doing here?
Eddie is gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me.</i>

11:48.175 --> 11:51.406
Eddie hates the Beatles.
He's gonna think I'm immature.
I just know it.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.946
<i>Do we have to hear about Eddie
all the way into the city?</i>

11:54.014 --> 11:56.209
Pam, can I see your ring, please?
Just for a minute?

11:56.283 --> 11:59.582
Well, all right,
but be careful with it.

11:59.653 --> 12:05.148
<i>Why do you keep it in your boobs for, Pam?
You're gonna lose it that way.
Do you want my mother to see it?</i>

12:05.225 --> 12:07.216
<i>Pam, you're so lucky.
Yeah, I guess.</i>

12:07.294 --> 12:12.425
<i>No, I mean it.
I'll probably never get one of these.
Oh, don't be silly, Rosie. It's no big deal.</i>

12:12.499 --> 12:17.664
Yeah. Well, there's really only one guy
I wanna marry anyways... Paul.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.071
- Paul? Paul who?
- Never mind. You don't know him.

12:21.141 --> 12:24.133
Larry, I think we're being followed.
Oh, God! Not the cops!

12:24.211 --> 12:27.339
- Relax!
- It's Tony Smerko!

12:31.284 --> 12:34.776
#Yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna hold your glands #

12:38.391 --> 12:40.621
Hey, Janis, how do
you like my hairdo?

12:40.694 --> 12:43.162
Oh, it's really fab!
It makes you look like Paul!

12:43.230 --> 12:45.494
Oh, you like it? You got it!

12:45.565 --> 12:48.033
Hey, where you guys goin'?
Oh, we're gonna
go see the Beatles!

12:48.101 --> 12:52.265
The Beatles? Aw, the Beatles
are a bunch of crap. Hey, Janis,
why don't you come with us?

12:52.339 --> 12:56.298
We got a whole case
of Miller's High Life here,
the champagne of bottled beers!

12:56.376 --> 13:00.176
<i>What do you say, gorgeous?
Here, open this one.</i>

13:01.448 --> 13:03.541
Aww, come on.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.608
Janis! Hey!

13:05.685 --> 13:09.678
Hey, pull up! A little closer.

13:10.690 --> 13:14.387
Pull it closer. Pull it closer!
Hey, Dubois, how ya doin'?

13:16.463 --> 13:19.864
Pull it close. Pull it closer here!
Are you crazy?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.766
Hey, you don't mind if I...
if I come along with you, now, do you?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.963
Oh, I don't know, Tony.
I haven't got no insurance or nothin'.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.006
Aw, that's okay. Neither do I!

13:27.073 --> 13:29.735
<i>#I've been told when a boy kiss a girl #</i>

13:29.810 --> 13:32.973
<i>What are you doin'?
# Take a trip around the world #</i>

13:33.046 --> 13:36.345
<i>#Hey, Hey #
#Bop shoo wop, bop bop shoo wop #</i>

13:36.416 --> 13:39.214
<i>#Hey, Hey #
#Bop shoo wop, bop bop shoo wop #</i>

13:39.286 --> 13:41.914
<i>#Hey, Hey #
#Bop shoo wop #</i>

13:41.988 --> 13:43.979
<i>#Bop bop shoo wop #
#She say you do #</i>

13:50.163 --> 13:52.563
<i>Damn it, Smerko,
what are you tryin' to do? Kill us?</i>

13:52.632 --> 13:54.759
Hey, lighten up!
No harm done here.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.565
Everybody's in one piece. Huh!

13:57.637 --> 14:01.164
Hmm.
Ohh! Oh-ho!

14:01.241 --> 14:05.007
Want a swig of this stuff?

14:05.078 --> 14:07.911
Say, what is that?
Let me see this.
What do you got?

14:07.981 --> 14:12.941
"Beatles"... What does this say?
"Beatles undermine artistic"...

14:13.019 --> 14:16.682
<i>Integrity!
I never would've figured
on you for a Beatles fan.</i>

14:16.756 --> 14:20.123
I loathe the Beatles.
Not me. I hate 'em. Uuh!

14:20.193 --> 14:22.593
I can't stand their music.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.927
- Hey, Dubois, get up.
- What?

14:28.001 --> 14:31.334
I think you're sittin'
on my comb.
Got it, Tony?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.865
Yeah, thanks.
Easy.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.972
Ooh, hoo-hoo!
Say, you got some collection here.

14:43.049 --> 14:48.954
Ann-Margret, we got Patty Duke,
Tuesday Weld, Jackie... Jackie Kennedy?

14:49.022 --> 14:52.651
<i>Jesus, Dubois, you got the hots
forJackie Kennedy?
Why'd you take my wallet, Tony?</i>

14:52.726 --> 14:55.126
Fastest hands in the West.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.423
<i>Yeah, well, you give me back...</i>

15:03.036 --> 15:07.735
Look. Now, look, no more screwin' around
here, Smerko! We have serious business
to take care of in New York!

15:07.807 --> 15:11.299
- Hey, well, I'm a serious guy.
- Right. Well, you just keep
your hands off of Dubois.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.575
- Hey, me and Dubois are old pals,
ain't we, Dubois?
- Yeah.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.879
Hey, Dubois, about what happened
in the cafeteria Friday?

15:17.951 --> 15:20.044
Look, I guess I must've
slipped or somethin'.
Yeah.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.352
Did you get all of the applesauce
outta your hair okay?
No problem, Tony.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.450
- Hey, I'm sick of those limey fairies!
- Come on, Smerko!

15:27.527 --> 15:31.156
- Hey, switch that back!
That was Peter, Paul and Mary!

15:31.231 --> 15:33.665
You and your stupid protest music.
That stuff's boring.

15:33.733 --> 15:37.931
Did you ever listen to the words?
You oughta try listening
to the words sometime.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.964
Did you ever listen to the words
to "Louie, Louie"?
Oh, Smerko, leave me alone!

15:43.043 --> 15:46.274
<i>Hey, who's still up
at this hour? I'm gonna find out by givin'away
two Sullivan show tickets...</i>

15:46.346 --> 15:51.113
to the first caller who can tell me
which Beatle is left handed.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.483
<i>All right...
Oh, my God! I know it!
It's Paul! It's Paul!</i>

15:54.554 --> 15:57.182
I know it! There's a phone booth!

15:57.257 --> 16:00.226
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
Oh, please stop the car! Stop the car!
- Cut it out!

16:00.293 --> 16:04.195
- You either stop the car, or I'll jump out!
- Keep driving, Larry!

16:06.566 --> 16:09.729
Jesus Christ, Dubois!

16:22.615 --> 16:25.106
What the hell are you trying to do,
Rosie, kill yourself?

16:25.185 --> 16:30.350
No, but I know the answer!
It's Paul!

16:30.423 --> 16:34.826
Jesus Christ!
I don't care! It would've worth
killing myself if I could've won!

16:34.894 --> 16:36.828
Now, listen... listen to me!
God, I could...

16:36.896 --> 16:41.196
This is my only chance to get
exclusive pictures of the Beatles,
and I don't want anybody screwing it up!

16:41.267 --> 16:43.827
So everybody, please, cool it!

16:43.903 --> 16:47.361

17:57.477 --> 18:03.416
Ahh! Everybody, wake up!
Wake up, everybody. Hey!

18:03.483 --> 18:06.418
I think Dubois here deserves
a big round of applause.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.445
As you can see, he got us
to New York safe and sound,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.151
and in record time too.

18:13.226 --> 18:17.128
Well, it only took him seven hours.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.358
Usually takes me only 20 minutes,
but then,

18:19.432 --> 18:23.630
<i>I generally don't go
by way of Philadelphia!</i>

18:23.703 --> 18:27.161

Hey, just keep your eyes on the road.
The hotel's right around the corner.

Pull up to the front of the hotel
like you know what you're doing.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.083
Okay? Here, put this on.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.358
<i>- We want the Beatles!

19:24.430 --> 19:29.231
- Yeah, I just hope Eddie
doesn't find out about this.
- Right. Okay, so Rosie and Pam are with me.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.863
And the rest of you guys, we'll meet you
later in front of the hotel, okay?
Now, everybody, duck down.

19:32.939 --> 19:36.033
<i>I don't want this car

Why aren't we there yet?
Yeah, Larry,
why aren't we there yet?

There's a bunch of old people
in a cab up there.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.325
Well, so what?
Why don't you just beep your horn?

21:10.403 --> 21:14.635
You crazy? There's about
a thousand girls screaming out there.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.423
Hey, Dubois! Leave the heater on!
It's not funny!

23:11.491 --> 23:15.723
Well, I guess we got
to make our own heat.
Jesus!

23:15.795 --> 23:21.062
Hey, wait a minute!
Where you goin'?
I came here for a purpose, Smerko!

23:23.903 --> 23:27.600
Hey, where you goin', Tony?
I came here for a purpose, Dubois.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.036
Come on. Let's go.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.345
Oh, my God, Grace, my purse!
I left it in the car.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.979
- Forget your purse, Pam. You wanna get caught?
- Hey, you kids!

23:42.054 --> 23:44.682
<i>Hold it right there!
Come on. Come on!</i>

23:44.757 --> 23:46.748

23:46.826 --> 23:50.819
Where do you think you're goin'?
Come back here, I said!
Oh, God!

All right, listen.

24:22.595 --> 24:26.053
I am out here only to let you
know about one thing.

24:26.132 --> 24:30.432
We don't want you to move.
We want you to stay here.
We like the vibe that you're givin' off.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.494
- But you been yellin' so loud,
- Look!

24:32.572 --> 24:36.030
<i>you broke a couple of windows.</i>

24:54.026 --> 24:57.826
Oh, he's coming!
In here!

25:20.186 --> 25:22.177
The elevator's here.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.280
The elevator's here.
The...

25:46.546 --> 25:48.605
He's gone!
He's gone. Let's go!

25:51.951 --> 25:55.387
- Come on!
- My ring! I lost my ring!

25:55.454 --> 25:57.445
Come on!
How long can she hold the door?

25:57.523 --> 26:00.048
Well, then go without me.
I've gotta find it.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.494
I've got it!

26:03.563 --> 26:05.554
Oh!

26:11.203 --> 26:14.570
What'd you push 11 for?
They're on 12, room 1232.

26:14.640 --> 26:18.337
I know they're in 1232, Rosie,
but we've gotta go up to 11
and walk up the stairs.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.902
That's dumb. If they're on 12,
we should get off on 12.

26:20.980 --> 26:25.212
Don't be stupid, Rosie.
There's gonna be guards up there on 12,
and they're gonna be watching the elevators.

26:25.284 --> 26:29.311
But this is a service elevator.
Besides, how you know there're
not gonna be guards on 11?

26:29.388 --> 26:32.186
<i>If I'm gonna get caught,
I'm gonna get as close to the Beatles as I can.</i>

26:32.258 --> 26:35.785
You wanna go to 12, go to 12, Rosie.
I'm not gonna argue with you.

26:35.861 --> 26:39.092
You're never gonna make it.
We'll see.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.872
- Hey, you! Come on! Let's go! Come on!
- Wait! Let me go!

26:54.947 --> 26:59.008
Come on!
You gotta listen to me!
I can explain! Come on! Listen to me!

26:59.085 --> 27:01.952
Hey, Sarge, I just found
another lost lady.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.583
Okay, Lou.
Take her down the other elevator.

27:06.659 --> 27:10.459
Oh, I can explain.
Really, I can ex...
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

27:10.529 --> 27:14.727
Your grandmother from Alaska's
staying in the hotel, and you got lost
trying to find her. Come on.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.132
Help! Help me!

27:20.973 --> 27:23.908
When Paul finds out about this,
you're gonna be in a lot of trouble!

27:31.283 --> 27:33.581
- Come in, Harry.
- I read you, Sarge.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.315
<i>- What's the situation down there?
- All quiet here.</i>

27:36.389 --> 27:41.053
<i>- Okay. We'll be coming down
in a few minutes. I'll check with you later.
- Right. Over.</i>

27:45.464 --> 27:48.160
Hey, Irving.
Check that exit there, will ya?

28:00.613 --> 28:04.344
We got another one, Stanley.
Take her down to the lobby
and turn her over to Sergeant Bailey.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.351
Okay, Lou.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.791
Never in my life have I seen such
a disgusting display of vulgarity...

28:12.858 --> 28:14.917
as I've witnessed in this hotel.

28:14.994 --> 28:19.328
Young girls screaming
and running about... helter-skelter.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.798
You should be ashamed of yourself.

28:21.867 --> 28:27.601
- And as for this hotel, I was not aware
its clientele included such riffraff.
- We apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am.

28:27.673 --> 28:31.700
Well, you can rest assured
that in the future I shall take
my business elsewhere.

28:31.777 --> 28:33.768
<i>Your floor, madam.</i>

28:35.781 --> 28:38.875
You dropped something, ma'am.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.833
<i>- We want the Beatles!
- Okay. Pull right up here.</i>

29:35.908 --> 29:38.274
Right. Hold it! Hold it right there.
That's good.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.335
I'll just get the door.
Yeah, sure.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.903
<i>We want the Beatles!

That's terrific.</i>

29:42.982 --> 29:47.316
<i>- We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles!
- Okay, Sarge. You can bring 'em out.</i>

29:47.386 --> 29:52.221
<i>- Your snoring.
Sullivan. You do. That's an Irish name.</i>

29:52.291 --> 29:55.317
<i>- We got a complaint from
the hotel manager about it.
- You're as bad as the rest of them.</i>

29:55.394 --> 29:59.694
<i>- Who orders all this rubbish?
- Nothing better than a scenic back alley,
I always say.</i>

29:59.765 --> 30:01.699
<i>Get in the car or I'll cripple you.</i>

30:01.767 --> 30:04.861
Quit shovin' me then.
Hey! The guy just licked my hand!

30:04.937 --> 30:07.405
Oh!

30:07.473 --> 30:10.772
Oh! Oh!

30:13.112 --> 30:15.103
Mmm.

30:16.882 --> 30:21.876
Hey! Don't you know breaking
and entering is very serious offense?

30:21.954 --> 30:26.755
You're making a mistake.
This is my room. I just lost my key.

30:26.826 --> 30:31.320
Oh, 1232. I'm on the wrong floor.
I'm looking for 1332.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.388
My mistake, Officer.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.499
What do you take me for,
some kind of an asshole?

30:37.570 --> 30:39.731
And, little lady,
you have come all the way from...
Hi, Mom!

30:39.805 --> 30:44.469
Buffalo. I stole the money from my mother
so I could come here, because I loveJohn.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.410
Actually, I love all the Beatles,
but I especially loveJohn.

30:47.479 --> 30:52.007
Someday I'm gonna marryJohn.
Isn'tJohn already married?

30:52.084 --> 30:54.985
Yeah, but he can get a divorce
or his wife could get in a plane crash...

30:55.054 --> 30:58.820
or she could drown or anything could happen,
becauseJohn has to marry me!

30:58.891 --> 31:02.156
He has to, or else I'll kill myself!

31:04.330 --> 31:07.595
There you have it,
ladies and gentlemen...
Beatlemania.

31:07.666 --> 31:11.227
This is Sam David reporting from WGSL
in front of the...

31:11.303 --> 31:13.294
Exterminate the Beatles!

31:13.372 --> 31:16.034
Get outta here! Harry, cut it.
Get her out of here.
Why did you shut off that camera?

31:16.108 --> 31:19.077
Turn it back on!
Haven't you ever heard of unbiased reporting?

31:19.144 --> 31:21.305
Yeah, unbiased report!
There are two sides to every story!

31:21.380 --> 31:25.146
There's two sides. Don't you know that?
I don't believe this!
Whatever happened to objective reporting?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.708
Yeah! Whatever happened to that?
You tell me.

31:27.786 --> 31:32.314
What are you beefin' about now?
It doesn't matter.
This is only a local news station.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.883
I know what I have to do now.
I gotta find the national news reporters,

31:35.961 --> 31:39.158
then the whole country
can hear what I have to say.
Talk, talk, talk.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.167
That's all you wanna do is talk.
I want the whole country
to hear what I have to say.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.796
<i>Shit. When does beatin' your gums
ever mean mean anything?
You gotta do something.</i>

31:46.872 --> 31:50.706
Well, I don't see you doing anything
except for following me around.
Oh, yeah?

31:50.776 --> 31:53.540
Yeah!
Oh, you wanna
see me do somethin'?

31:53.612 --> 31:56.376
All ri... Wha...
All right. I'll do somethin'!

32:03.689 --> 32:05.680
Get him!

32:05.758 --> 32:08.090
Look, I'll find my own way out, okay?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.151
Make me happy.

32:47.533 --> 32:51.367
Hey! Hey, you! You're not supposed to be here!
This is a restricted area!

32:51.437 --> 32:55.737
<i>You don't belong here!
Don't you know this entire section
of the hotel's completely sealed off?</i>

32:55.808 --> 32:58.834
Paul! Paul!
You can't get in there.
Besides, I already tried.

32:58.911 --> 33:02.142
Those guys already left.
When?

33:02.214 --> 33:05.183
About five minutes ago.
Ohh!

33:05.250 --> 33:09.880
Well, actually, it was closer
to four minutes ago. Crazy broad.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.552
What? What?

33:14.626 --> 33:17.220
That means they walked on this rug!

33:17.296 --> 33:20.788
Don't jump to conclusions! I'm a collector!
Please, don't get a stain on it!
Oh, Paul! Paul!

33:20.866 --> 33:24.324
- In the name of human decency!
This is valuable merchandise!
- Hey!

33:24.403 --> 33:27.236
<i>Oh! Come on! Run!
What are you doin'to the rug?</i>

33:27.306 --> 33:30.207
Run!
Gangway, copper!

33:30.275 --> 33:33.438
Put me down!
I got friends on the force!
Put me down!

33:33.512 --> 33:35.707
Take that, bully!

33:37.116 --> 33:39.107
Come on, come on!
Where you taking me?

33:39.184 --> 33:42.278
I know where I'm going!
Just come on!
Aah!

33:44.556 --> 33:46.751
Where we going? Ooh!
Come on!

33:46.825 --> 33:49.055
Take me with you!
Come on!

33:51.030 --> 33:53.794
I can't go in there!
This elevator isn't lined up properly!
God!

33:53.866 --> 33:57.324
Ooh! Aah!
Take me to the seventh floor!
I got a room there!

33:57.403 --> 33:59.394
Right!

34:31.136 --> 34:34.628
Come on! Let's go!
Can't you get these floors lined up?

34:34.706 --> 34:36.867
Come on!

34:36.942 --> 34:38.933
This way!

34:43.047 --> 34:47.178
<i>We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles!
We want the Beatles!</i>

34:47.252 --> 34:50.380
<i># Then there was music #
This is my headquarters.</i>

34:50.456 --> 34:55.416
<i>#And wonderful roses, they tell me #</i>

34:55.494 --> 34:59.123
<i>#In sweet, fragrant meadows #</i>

34:59.198 --> 35:03.862

<i>#Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

35:08.040 --> 35:10.406
#Yeah, yeah, yeah ##

35:13.679 --> 35:17.410
Hey, Larry, where have you been?
I've been lookin' all over for ya.

35:17.483 --> 35:21.351
We've gotta get over to CBS right away.
I just found out the Beatles
are rehearsing over there.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.753
Yeah, well, I got news for ya!
After this, I'm gonna be taking
my car straight home!

35:24.823 --> 35:28.350
Sure, Larry. Anything you say.
I mean it, Grace.
This time I'm puttin' my foot down.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.697
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's happening?

35:34.766 --> 35:37.257
They stink. They got no talent at all.
They look like a bunch of girls!

35:37.336 --> 35:41.170
Yeah, man, we hate the Beatles, man.
They're foreigners from another country.

35:41.240 --> 35:46.303
They take our women away from us.
Man, send them back! Send 'em back!
Yeah, the Beatles are a bunch of wimps.

35:46.378 --> 35:51.111
Everybody that listens to their music are wimps
too. What're trying to prove with long hair?
You're misunderstanding the whole point.

35:51.183 --> 35:54.880
I don't know what
these chicks see in it either.
It's just a gimmick!

35:54.953 --> 35:57.444
Oh, and another thing, Murray.

35:57.523 --> 36:02.586
WI NS used to be the best radio station
in town until you started playing
all this Beatles junk.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.757
Now that's all I ever hear!
Whatever happened to the Four Seasons?
Yeah!

36:06.832 --> 36:10.825
I ain't never gonna listen to 1010 WI NS
again ever. Never gonna, never ever.
All right. Wait a minute.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.894
You know something?
What?

36:12.971 --> 36:16.304
You're a deranged person,
but keep your chin up.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.844
<i>Yeah, Harry, my eyes were bothering me a little
with all the reading I'm doing around here.</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:33.324
<i>So I went and I picked up this lamp.
It's a real great lamp. I mean, it's got,
like, three switches on it to make it bright.</i>

36:33.392 --> 36:35.383
<i>Great for reading.</i>

36:35.460 --> 36:38.452
Yeah, that's right, Harry.
What do you think...

36:40.165 --> 36:42.326
What the hell's
the matter with you?

36:43.402 --> 36:45.870
Why don't you watch
where you push that thing?

36:47.206 --> 36:50.300
Harry? Hello, Harry?

36:50.375 --> 36:53.572
Stupid kid. He broke my lamp.

37:37.322 --> 37:40.450
Oh, my God!

37:40.525 --> 37:44.120
Oh! Ohh.

37:44.196 --> 37:46.687
Oh, God.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.359
Ohh, God!

37:49.434 --> 37:51.425
I don't believe...

37:52.838 --> 37:55.306
Oh, my God.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.365
Oh. Ohh!

37:58.777 --> 38:00.711

A midget Beatle!</i>

39:02.507 --> 39:05.635
Hey! Hey, come on!
Hey, what is it, a boy or a girl?

39:05.711 --> 39:07.702
Hey!
I think it's a girl!

39:07.779 --> 39:10.373
It's doctor's orders!
I'm very susceptible to head colds!
Hey, anybody got a razor blade?

39:10.449 --> 39:15.512
I wanna give Goldilocks here
the Yul Brynner look, huh?

39:15.587 --> 39:19.614
Ooh! All right.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
I'll make you a deal, I'll make you a deal!

39:19.691 --> 39:23.889
<i>- What?
- I got tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show,
and you can have 'em if you let me go.</i>

39:23.962 --> 39:26.522
Tickets? What the hell do I want tickets?
I don't want any tickets.
Hey, wait a minute!

39:26.598 --> 39:29.965
You can scalp 'em for a lot of money!
Well, I'm gonna scalp you for free!

39:30.035 --> 39:33.004
Oww!
All right, Tony. You've had your fun.
Now let him go.

39:33.071 --> 39:37.064
Hey, remember, I said you gotta
do somethin'. So I'm doin' somethin'.
I ain't just shootin' off at the mouth.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.576
Oww!
You're completely ignoring
the real issue.

39:39.644 --> 39:43.512
You're merely attacking a symptom
instead of going to the real root
of the problem.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.176
I'm gonna get to the roots,
all right, with these!

39:46.251 --> 39:49.084
Uh, hey, Smerko,
here comes a cop.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.249
I should've known this all along.

39:52.324 --> 39:55.885
You ain't nothin' but a Beatles lover.
Here. You take him.
Aah!

39:55.961 --> 39:58.953
Here's some great snapshots I got
when the Beatles arrived at Kennedy Airport.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.932
Oh. Did you get any pictures
of the Beatles?
Yeah, well, I didn't exactly see the Beatles,

40:03.001 --> 40:07.267
but I got some great shots
of their suitcases.
Wow.

40:07.339 --> 40:10.900
You know, you're the first boy
I've ever met that I could really talk to.

40:10.976 --> 40:15.572
I mean, really talk to.
Yeah, well, if you think these are fab,
I'll show you something that's really gear.

40:18.216 --> 40:23.745
Hey, don't they ever
make the beds in here?
Nah. The hotel doesn't know I'm in here.

40:23.822 --> 40:28.225
Then how'd you get this key?
I found it. Someone left it in the door,
and I found it.

40:28.293 --> 40:32.855
Then I took over the room.
The hotel doesn't know I'm here.
If they knew I was here, they'd throw me out.

40:32.931 --> 40:37.425
Now, here. Look at this, look at this,
look at this, look at this, look at this,
look at this, look at this.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.701
Here. This is my masterpiece.

40:41.840 --> 40:46.038
You know what this is?
This is actually a clump of grass
that Paul stepped on.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.410
I'm not exactly sure which blade
he stepped on, but it's all in there.
That's why I got such a big clump.

40:49.481 --> 40:52.473
Oh, wow! Can I have some of this?
What are you, crazy?

40:52.551 --> 40:56.351
Oh, just a little bit!
I'll buy it off of ya.
No. I'm sorry, but it's not for sale.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.652
<i>Say, kid, do you really have
tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show?</i>

40:59.724 --> 41:02.852
Yeah. I sort of lucked into 'em.
My uncle's got connections.

41:02.928 --> 41:07.024
Would you sell one to me?
Uh, no, I couldn't do that.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.828
Heck, you just helped me out
of a real jam.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.926
I'll give you one for free.
It's the least I can do.

41:12.003 --> 41:15.097
Thanks a lot!

41:15.173 --> 41:17.403
That's funny.
I thought I had 'em right there.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.001
I don't even have 'em!

41:20.078 --> 41:24.139
<i>Peter! Hey, Peter!
I got your tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show!</i>

41:24.216 --> 41:27.310
- My tickets! How'd you get those?
- Never mind how I got 'em, but I got 'em!

41:27.385 --> 41:29.910
If you wanna get 'em back, you're gonna
have to get your goddamn hair cut!

41:29.988 --> 41:35.722
<i>Now, I found a barber shop that's open,
so let's go!
You can't do that! It's extortion!</i>

41:35.794 --> 41:38.126
I can do any goddamn thing I want to!
I'm your father!
Sir.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.892
No kid of mine is gonna run around
in the streets looking like a goddamn girl!
Sir.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.560
- Wait a minute, will ya?
- Well, I'm not gonna cut my hair!

41:43.635 --> 41:48.732
And I'm not gonna argue with you! Now,
if you want these tickets back, you're gonna
get your hair cut! Now, you think about it!

41:48.807 --> 41:52.436
I don't have to think about it!
For all I care, you can take those tickets
and shove 'em!

41:52.511 --> 41:54.502
What's your name anyway?

41:54.579 --> 41:58.140
Ringo. Ringo Klaus.
What?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.707
Well, actually it's Richard,
Richard Klaus.

42:00.785 --> 42:03.515
This is my official
Beatles talcum powder.

42:03.588 --> 42:07.547
Anyway, like, Ringo Starr,
you know, he changed his name
from Richard to Ringo?

42:07.626 --> 42:10.754
Well, that's what I did.
My real name's Richard,
and I changed it over to Ringo, see?

42:10.829 --> 42:14.560
You know how the real Ringo has lots of rings?
Well, I got my own ring, too, see?
Just like Ringo.

42:14.633 --> 42:18.467
Good. I know all that stuff.
Listen, I know everything
there is to know about the Beatles.

42:18.537 --> 42:22.473
There's nothin' I don't know about the Beatles!
I'm the greatest Beatles genius
in the history of the universe.

42:22.541 --> 42:25.374
Go ahead, ask me
anything about the Beatles!
Ask me how tallJohn is.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.468
And the answer comeback,
5- foot-11.

42:27.546 --> 42:32.313
Ask me when George's birthday is.
And the answer comeback,
February 25, 1943.

42:32.384 --> 42:35.911
There's nothin' I don't know about the Beatles!
Ask me anything there is to know
about the Beatles. Ask me anything!

42:35.987 --> 42:38.979
Who is the youngest Beatle?

42:39.057 --> 42:41.753
I know the answer!
Gimme the phone!
Get away! I know it too!

42:41.826 --> 42:44.556
It's my room, and it's my phone!

42:44.629 --> 42:46.597
Hand it over!
Get away! Let me!

42:46.665 --> 42:48.656
It's ringing!

42:48.733 --> 42:50.724
Who's the youngest Beatle?
Ringo!
George!

42:50.802 --> 42:53.464
Aww!
It's Ringo! Ringo, you crackpot!

42:53.538 --> 42:56.735
You... You stupid idiot!
It's George!

42:56.808 --> 43:01.404
Ringo's the oldest!
Ringo's 23! George is 20!
Well, it's a trick question.

43:01.479 --> 43:05.575
George is the youngest in age,
but Ringo was the last to join the Beatles,
therefore he's the youngest Beatle.

43:05.650 --> 43:08.551
See? The question was,
"Who is the youngest Beatle?"
And that means it's Ringo!

43:08.620 --> 43:12.021
See? Aah!
You're an idiot! You're a fink!

43:12.090 --> 43:15.958
You're a lousy rat fink!
And I would've won those tickets!

43:18.263 --> 43:21.596
Aah! Now I got you,
you little shit-head!
Who you callin' little?

43:25.837 --> 43:27.998
Aah! Take that, you copper!

43:29.174 --> 43:32.041
Stay back!
Watch it, he's got a lamp!
And it's lit!

43:32.110 --> 43:35.273
Ai-yaah!
Give up, kid!
You're surrounded!

43:35.347 --> 43:38.043
I'll jump! I swear, I'll jump!

43:38.116 --> 43:40.482
Get off of me! Put me down!
I'll bring a lawsuit!

43:40.552 --> 43:42.713
<i>Stop it! Knock It off!</i>

43:42.787 --> 43:45.255
Quit that kickin', will ya?

43:45.323 --> 43:48.690
Ringo! No-o-o!

44:07.412 --> 44:11.678
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doin'?
There ain't no cameras allowed in here.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.480
I'm just takin' a couple of pictures.
I'm with the press.

44:14.552 --> 44:17.612
Yeah? And I'm Captain Kangaroo.
Come on! Get the hell outta here!

44:17.689 --> 44:21.386
Please, sir, I've just gotta get some pictures
of the Beatles. I'd do anything to get in here.
Yeah?

44:21.459 --> 44:23.484
Anything.
What's it worth to ya?

44:23.561 --> 44:25.927
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks?
What, are you shittin' me?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.761
I'll tell you what.
Fifty bucks, and you got a deal.

44:28.833 --> 44:31.825
Fifty bucks? Look, I just don't
have that kind of money.
Hey!

44:31.903 --> 44:34.394
You wanna get in and see 'em?
Fifty bucks. You don't like it?

44:34.472 --> 44:37.635
Get the hell outta here!
All right. All right, all right.
I'll find the 50.

44:37.709 --> 44:40.701
Then what do I do?

44:40.779 --> 44:43.179
Listen, here's what's happenin'.

44:43.248 --> 44:45.478
The Beatles are the last act, right?

44:45.550 --> 44:49.611
All right. You wait till the show starts,
you come to this door
and you knock like this.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.682
I open the door,
you give me the 50, you're in.

44:54.759 --> 44:57.057
Right now, get the hell outta here!
I gotta eat!

44:59.998 --> 45:04.401
Fifty bucks!
Where am I gonna get 50 bucks?

45:19.150 --> 45:21.675
Mmm. Mmm.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.818
Ahh!

45:33.164 --> 45:35.792
Mmm. Mmm.

45:58.957 --> 46:02.154
Is this seat taken?

46:03.928 --> 46:06.897
Say, how's the food around here?
You guys eat here often?

46:08.800 --> 46:12.531
Oh? Well, then, I take it that
you're not from around here, huh?

46:12.604 --> 46:17.098
- Brooklyn.
- No kiddin'? Me, I'm from Jersey.

46:19.711 --> 46:23.670
Hey, hey, way to go!
Nice play, Shakespeare.

46:30.155 --> 46:34.649
Say, you girls ever been on top
of the Empire State Building?

46:34.726 --> 46:40.062
Well, I was thinkin' about goin' up there
later on this afternoon and, uh,
maybe you'd like to join me?

46:40.131 --> 46:42.793
<i>Now, what's the gag?</i>

46:42.867 --> 46:48.169
- She thinks you look like Paul.
- Oh, yeah. Lots of people tell me
I look like Newman.

46:49.841 --> 46:55.370
- Not Paul Newman, Paul McCartney.
- Paul McCart... Never heard of him.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.608
He's one of the Beatles.

47:01.953 --> 47:03.944
Oh, ho!

47:05.156 --> 47:09.525
- What's with you?
You got something against the Beatles?
- Who, me?

47:09.594 --> 47:13.997
Besides the fact that their music stinks,
that I hate their guts...

47:14.065 --> 47:17.364
and they're nothin' but
a bunch of candy-ass pansies?

47:17.435 --> 47:19.494
- No.
- Listen, grease ball.

47:19.571 --> 47:22.768
- Nobody asked you to sit here, so beat it!
- Now, wait a minute.

47:22.841 --> 47:27.107
Everything was going fine,
we were having a nice leisurely lunch
and over a little chat,

47:27.178 --> 47:30.238
and then you had to go mention
the Beatles and make me choke
on my goddamn food!

47:30.315 --> 47:31.942
Let's get outta here.
Yeah.

47:32.016 --> 47:36.749
- Hey, wait a minute!
Now, what about the Empire State Building?
- Why don't you jump off it?

47:36.821 --> 47:41.190
- Hey, you know what I do to Beatles? I stomp...
- Ohh!

47:44.929 --> 47:47.329
Oh!

47:47.398 --> 47:49.389
Oh, wow!

47:49.467 --> 47:52.231
Oh.

48:06.651 --> 48:08.642
Oh.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.415
Ohh!

48:17.128 --> 48:19.824
Oh, my God.

48:19.898 --> 48:21.889
Ohh!

48:23.735 --> 48:26.067
Oh, my God.

48:26.137 --> 48:29.163
Oh, God!

49:15.053 --> 49:18.352
<i>#Surfin'U.S.A. #</i>

49:18.423 --> 49:21.859
<i>#Everybody's gone surfin'#</i>

49:21.926 --> 49:26.192
<i>#Surfin'U.S.A. With Murray the "K"##</i>

49:26.264 --> 49:29.131
- Hey, baby.
- Swinging Soiree.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.397
<i>- Hey, who's this Johnny Carson that Ed
wants us to dedicate our songs to anyway?</i>

49:32.470 --> 49:34.734
<i>- Probably a baseball player.
- No, isn't he the mayor?</i>

49:37.976 --> 49:41.912
I'm really disappointed about that rehearsal.
I mean, I think we sound crappy.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.711
Ah, come off it. All you gotta do is smile,
twinkle in the eye. You'll have 'em all screamin'.

49:47.618 --> 49:50.712
<i>Hey! Well, what do you know?
It's still playin'.</i>

49:50.788 --> 49:53.951
Murray is still talkin'.
Hey, it looks like somebody's
been messing with me bass.

49:54.025 --> 49:58.052
<i>- Yuck! There's sticky stuff all over it.
- Uuh! What'd you do that for?</i>

49:58.129 --> 50:01.724
Why'd you put that picture
of yourself in me closet?
I thought it might brighten up the place.

50:01.799 --> 50:03.960
So that's it then.
Well?

50:04.035 --> 50:07.004
<i>Right here 1010 WINS
right after The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

50:07.071 --> 50:11.371
<i>- Will somebody call the porter up here?
I need me trousers cleaned.
- Well, take 'em off then.</i>

50:11.442 --> 50:14.707
<i>I mean, you know, he can't clean 'em
with you standin'in 'em.
Good idea.</i>

50:14.779 --> 50:17.247
<i>Ohh!</i>

50:17.315 --> 50:21.308
And my stockings...
my official Beatles nylon stockings...
are missing.

50:21.386 --> 50:24.514
Those jerks from the hotel
stole my stuff, and you know why?

50:24.589 --> 50:27.615
They know even half my stuff's
worth $500.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.853
I'll sue 'em. That's what I'll do.
I'll sue 'em.

50:29.927 --> 50:34.296
- I just think we're lucky
they didn't throw us in jail.
- They can't throw us in jail.

50:34.365 --> 50:38.995
We're both under 18 years old. Therefore,
we're both minors. Therefore, they can't
throw us in jail, and that's the law.

50:39.070 --> 50:43.871
And if there's one thing I know,
it's the law. Anyway, I gotta get back
in the hotel and get my stuff back.

50:43.941 --> 50:47.274
I know. I'll steal an elevator.
I'll hijack one like you did.

50:47.345 --> 50:50.041
Rosie, come here!
I gotta tell ya somethin'!

50:50.114 --> 50:52.981
Grace! Grace!
Where have you been? Did you
get pictures of the Beatles?

50:53.051 --> 50:55.315
Grace, you know, it's, uh,
illegal to park here.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.320
<i>We're not parking, Larry.
We're just stopping.
Hey! Where have you been?</i>

50:57.388 --> 51:01.085
Did you get the pictures?
No, not yet. Listen, Rosie. I really
need to borrow some money, okay?

51:01.159 --> 51:04.492
Oh, Grace, no...
I don't have that much left.
What did you spend it on?

51:04.562 --> 51:06.587
On these.
What are these?

51:06.664 --> 51:09.064
Beatles bedsheets.
Beatles bedsheets?

51:09.133 --> 51:13.593
Those are the actual bedsheets
the Beatles slept on Friday night.
Only two bucks per square inch.

51:13.671 --> 51:16.902
You mean you paid two bucks
for this little piece of nothing?
They're worth at least five.

51:16.974 --> 51:19.101
Grace, what time do you think
we'll be going home?
Oh, yeah?

51:19.177 --> 51:23.045
How do you know these
are the real Beatles bedsheets?
The guy said they were authentic.

51:23.114 --> 51:25.639
You can't lie
about a thing like that.
That would be against the law.

51:25.716 --> 51:28.480
<i>Grace, we should
be getting home. I don't wanna
miss The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

51:28.553 --> 51:31.750
Tell me something. Were there
a lot of kids buyin' these things?
Oh, heck, yeah.

51:31.823 --> 51:34.291
You want me to show you where
the guy is that sold 'em to me?
Here. Take these.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.690
Come on, Larry.
Let's get outta here.
Wait. You gotta take me with you.

51:36.761 --> 51:40.197
I'm the only one who knows
where the guy is that sold me this stuff.
You gotta take me with ya.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.789
What is wrong with you?
Who is this guy, Rosie?
Where'd he come from? Mars?

51:42.867 --> 51:46.667
Oh, this is Richard Klaus.
He's my boyfriend.
Your boyfriend?

51:46.737 --> 51:50.696
<i>Grace, wait.
What about The Ed Sullivan Show?
Well, you'd better find a TV set,</i>

51:50.775 --> 51:53.767
because I still have
to get my pictures.

51:55.179 --> 51:59.548
Your boyfriend? What's the idea
of telling that broad I'm your boyfriend?
I'm not your boyfriend.

51:59.617 --> 52:02.484
But I thought you and me...
Well, we seemed to get along
pretty well and all.

52:02.553 --> 52:05.886
Yeah? I thought
you were in love with Paul.

52:05.957 --> 52:08.892
Well, I am, but it's different
with Paul.

52:08.960 --> 52:12.919
- I mean, Paul... He's a Beatle.
It's just different.
- Yeah. I get it.

52:12.997 --> 52:17.024
<i>You're just like all the rest. You're in love
with the Beatles till somebody better
comes along, huh?</i>

52:17.101 --> 52:20.195
Well, I got news for ya.
Where I come from, they've got a name
for people like you.

52:20.271 --> 52:24.230
You're a traitor, and I don't
associate with traitors, so you can
just quit taggin' along with me.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.674
"Amscray," sister!

52:26.744 --> 52:29.645
I am not a traitor!
I do love Paul!

52:29.714 --> 52:33.810
<i>I'll always love Paul!</i>

52:33.885 --> 52:37.377
I'll never love anybody else, ever!

52:37.455 --> 52:41.482
<i>#I love you #</i>

52:42.927 --> 52:46.624
<i>You know,
you'd make things a lot easier
if you'djust cut your hair.</i>

52:48.733 --> 52:51.668
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I got it.

52:51.736 --> 52:54.136
- Hey!
- Let's get outta here!

52:54.205 --> 52:58.141
Hey, you kids!
Come back!
Come on! This way!

52:58.209 --> 53:00.769
- Come back here!
Come on! Let's get 'em!

53:00.845 --> 53:02.836
You all right?

53:02.914 --> 53:04.848
<i>Security for the Beatles.
This way!</i>

53:04.916 --> 53:09.080
<i>At times, the Beatles had to
dress themselves up as the fuzz...</i>

53:09.153 --> 53:13.180
<i>- in order to go from place to place without
getting torn to shreds by all those girls.
- Excuse me.</i>

53:13.257 --> 53:15.885
Which way?
Which way did they go?
Down here.

53:15.960 --> 53:20.454
<i>We've got another one
that you haven't heard yet from
that crazy British import album.</i>

53:20.531 --> 53:24.228
<i>You're hearing it first with the "K"
in what you call Swinging Soiree.</i>

53:24.302 --> 53:30.104
<i>In fact, I think
I'm gonna mail it out to you.
# Oh, yeah, wait a minute, Mr. Postman #</i>

53:30.174 --> 53:32.836
Hey, Reese,
I got the one with the hair.
Let him go!

53:32.910 --> 53:35.105
He wasn't doing anything.
Grab her too.

53:35.179 --> 53:38.239
You're just picking on him
because he's got long hair.
Shut up.

53:38.316 --> 53:40.944
Let that kid go.
Yeah. Let him go.

53:41.018 --> 53:44.044
- Just because he's got long hair
doesn't mean you can do all that.
- Let go of him!

53:47.091 --> 53:50.026
<i>- Hey, what's going...
- All right! Get back!</i>

53:50.094 --> 53:54.827
Get back! Get back!
Get back in line!

53:54.899 --> 53:57.197
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

53:57.268 --> 54:00.101
Get back! I'm warning ya.
Now, get back.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.663
Move along.

54:07.111 --> 54:10.410
<i>Get back!
Get that crowd back!</i>

54:10.481 --> 54:13.678
Get back in line.
Get back.

54:13.751 --> 54:17.812
Reese, Foley, let 'em go!
But, Sarge, they were tryin'
to break into the studio.

54:17.888 --> 54:21.949
Goddamn it, I said let 'em go!
I don't want a riot on my hands.

54:22.026 --> 54:25.462
All right. Go on.
Get outta here. Beat it.

54:27.131 --> 54:30.862
Wow. Did you see that?
Do you realize
what just happened here?

54:30.935 --> 54:34.063
Yeah. We almost
just got thrown in jail.
You were right all the time.

54:34.138 --> 54:37.835
The only way we're gettin'
in there is to get my hair cut.
You can't.

54:37.908 --> 54:42.470
What?
You can't cut your hair.
Not now. Not after all this.

54:42.546 --> 54:46.846
I just don't get ya.
I mean, don't you wanna
go and see the show?

54:46.917 --> 54:51.911
Look, all this time I've been wrong
about the Beatles. I'll figure out some
other way to get those tickets back.

54:51.989 --> 54:54.389
What? From my old man?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.256
No way. The only way
you're gonna get those tickets
from him is to take 'em.

54:57.795 --> 55:01.060
Genuine squares
of Beatle bedsheets,
only one dollar!

55:01.132 --> 55:04.295
Ladies, they're huggable,
they're kissable. Unwashed, girls...

55:04.368 --> 55:07.030
unwashed Beatles bedsheets...
and they're only one dollar!

55:07.104 --> 55:09.129
Bigger and better
Beatles bedsheets!
Can I have a John?

55:09.206 --> 55:11.231
AJohn. Here's a John.
One dollar.
Can I have a George?

55:11.309 --> 55:13.971
Here's George.
One dollar.
Hey, are you sure these are real?

55:14.045 --> 55:16.741
It doesn't look like the ones
they're selling over there.
That's 'cause they're newer.

55:16.814 --> 55:20.079
They just came off the Beatles' beds
this very morning.
Look how wrinkled it is!

55:20.151 --> 55:23.518
Okay. Anybody else?
I want to buy $40 worth
for my whole fan club.

55:23.587 --> 55:26.750
Ten of each Beatle.
Ten of each Beatle?

55:26.824 --> 55:29.759
Well... Well, look.
I only have about 23,
but I can get some more.

55:29.827 --> 55:31.795
I'll meet you back here
in 10 minutes, okay?
Okay!

55:31.862 --> 55:34.854
Hey. Wanna
buy some Beatle bedsheets?
They slept on 'em.

55:34.932 --> 55:37.230
For one dollar?

55:37.301 --> 55:40.600
Hey, would you like
to buy some Beatle bedsheets
for one dollar?

55:44.608 --> 55:47.543
For Christ's sakes, Dubois,
what the hell are you doin'?

55:47.611 --> 55:51.377
I'm selling some Beatle bedsheets.
I can see that.

55:51.449 --> 55:56.352
Geez! Is this what it's come to?
You standin' in the street with a handful
of rags like a goddamn beggar?

55:56.420 --> 55:59.321
Ain't you got no self-respect?
Get rid of this shit!

56:00.324 --> 56:02.986
Damn it, Dubois.
How could you let yourself
be pussy-whipped like this?

56:03.060 --> 56:06.393
You know she's made a fool
out of ya. You know that, don't ya?
A damn fool!

56:06.464 --> 56:10.025
Yeah. I was just tryin'
to get pictures for her, Tony.
I mean, she needed pictures...

56:10.101 --> 56:13.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know it ain't your fault.
It's that... that limey scum.

56:13.704 --> 56:18.607
It's like the whole goddamn world's
flipped or somethin' like that.

56:18.676 --> 56:24.046
You know what happened
to me today? I tried to pick up
seven different chicks. Seven.

56:24.115 --> 56:27.209
And they all gave me shit.
They gave me shit! Now, a week ago,
this couldn't have happened.

56:27.284 --> 56:30.219
I'm fed up, Dubois. I've had it
up to here with this crap.

56:30.287 --> 56:33.484
Something's gotta be done.
Something's gotta be done
to stop it...

56:33.557 --> 56:36.253
I don't know what...
but it's gotta be done now
before it spreads any further.

56:36.327 --> 56:39.922
It's like a goddamn disease,
for Christ's sakes! Do you
understand what I'm saying here?

56:39.997 --> 56:43.865
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna get back
to the car, Tony, so...

56:45.503 --> 56:48.995
Yeah. Go ahead.
Go on. I'll... I gotta
think this shit out.

56:49.073 --> 56:54.773
#We love you, Beatles
oh, yes, we do #

56:54.845 --> 56:58.679
#We don't love anyone
as much as you #

56:58.749 --> 57:03.277
#When you're not near us
we're blue #

57:03.354 --> 57:07.085
# Oh, Beatles, we love you #

57:07.158 --> 57:11.424
#We love you, Beatles
oh, yes, we do ##

57:25.042 --> 57:28.569
Well, if nobody wanted to buy any,
then where's your sheets?

57:28.646 --> 57:31.877
Well, I, um... I don't know.
I dropped 'em.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.747
God damn, Larry.
Come on. Here.

57:34.819 --> 57:38.983
Help me rip this sheet up.
Only 17 more pieces,
and I'm home free.

57:40.191 --> 57:42.250
<i>#I got arms that long to hold you #</i>

57:42.326 --> 57:45.261
<i>#And keep you by my side #</i>

57:45.329 --> 57:49.322
<i>#I got lips that long to kiss you #</i>

57:49.400 --> 57:52.335
<i>#And keep you satisfied #</i>

57:52.403 --> 57:54.735
<i>#If there's anything that you want #
Hi.</i>

57:54.805 --> 57:58.434
<i>#If there's anything I can do #</i>

57:58.509 --> 58:01.137
- Grace?
- Would you cut it out?

58:01.212 --> 58:04.272
<i>Grace?
#And I'll send it along
with love from me to you #</i>

58:04.348 --> 58:07.476
- Hand it over, scag.
- What?

58:07.551 --> 58:10.019
Our money.
These are fakes.

58:11.222 --> 58:14.783
- Oh, there must be some mistake.
- Damn right. Look at this.

58:14.859 --> 58:18.295
I know for a fact
they didn't use sheets
from J.C. Penney's at that hotel.

58:18.362 --> 58:21.388
I swear to you...
I was told these sheets
are genuine. They really are.

58:21.465 --> 58:24.923
<i>Give us our money back
or we'll beat your brains.
Hey, hey.</i>

58:25.002 --> 58:28.267
Come on, girls.
Let's... Let's be reasonable.

58:28.339 --> 58:31.706
Listen, pencil neck.
I'll kick your face in.

58:31.775 --> 58:37.179
<i>- Grace, I think they mean it.
- #If there's anything
that you want #</i>

58:37.248 --> 58:40.308
<i>#If there's anything I can do #</i>

58:40.384 --> 58:43.876
<i>#Just call on me
and I'll send it along #</i>

58:43.954 --> 58:47.355
<i># With love from me to you #
Looks like
you're out of business.</i>

58:47.424 --> 58:50.689
<i># To you, to you #</i>

58:50.761 --> 58:52.752
<i># To you ##</i>

58:54.198 --> 58:56.723
<i>Okay. We're still T.C.B.
And takin'care ofbusiness...</i>

58:56.800 --> 58:59.291
<i>as we cover
this fabulous Beatle weekend.</i>

58:59.537 --> 59:03.974
And you probably don't hear
as much going on as there was...
not as much shouting...

59:04.041 --> 59:09.206
<i>It's because 33 minutes ago, everybody
that was here with this big crowd left...</i>

59:09.280 --> 59:12.113
<i>Because
the Beatles are going over
to The Ed Sullivan Show...</i>

59:12.182 --> 59:15.117
to do their first telecast
in the United States.

59:15.185 --> 59:17.176
And you wanna watch that.
I'm gonna be there myself.

59:24.395 --> 59:27.762
<i>Hey, Grace, did you hear
about the Valentine's Dance
at school Friday night?</i>

59:27.831 --> 59:32.131
I know all about it, Larry.
Why don't you just have a drink,
okay?

59:32.202 --> 59:35.660
I'd better not. I mean,
you know what they say
about drinking and driving.

59:35.739 --> 59:39.004
<i>Frankie? Yeah.
I was thinkin'.</i>

59:39.076 --> 59:42.341
I'm glad I got in touch with ya.
I got a few hours to kill
before I have to go out of town,

59:42.413 --> 59:46.543
and I could use a little companionship,
you know what I mean?

59:46.617 --> 59:49.245
<i>You see, Grace, it's kind ofhard...
Yeah. Is Ginger available?</i>

59:49.320 --> 59:53.620
<i>I was sort of thinkin'
about all we've been through together.
How 'bout that redhead? What's her name?</i>

59:53.691 --> 59:56.023
<i>Judy. Yeah. Is she... No.</i>

59:56.093 --> 01:00:01.156
Whatever you think, Frankie. As long as she's
on the young side, you know what I mean?

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:05.600
- A college coed?
- And, well, you'll probably be busy,
so forget it.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:10.697
<i>- Shh.
Hey, no kiddin'.</i>

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.300
Hey, yeah. That's right.
Room 909.

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.142
Mm-hmm. That's great.
Why don't you send her over?

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.978
Yeah. How 'bout...
'bout an hour?

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.018
Yeah.

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.816
Half hour would be better,
Frankie. Yeah.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:28.585
Thanks, Frankie.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.287
<i>Grace, it's gettin'kind oflate.
Maybe we'd better get goin'.</i>

01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:35.389
Larry, how old
do you think I look?

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:43.135
- I don't know.
- I mean, you think I could pass
for a college student?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:46.802
Sure. Sure.
You get good grades.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:54.114
Larry, there's something I gotta do.
I want you to meet me back here
in about one hour.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:59.349
Wait. Where you goin'?
I just thought of something
I could sell.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.551
Why don't you tell me?
Maybe I can sell some too.

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:07.222
I don't think so, Larry.
You just wait for me, okay?

01:01:07.297 --> 01:01:12.701
Grace, you can't!
I won't let you do it.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.762
Do what?
You know.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.399
What?
You know.

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:23.071
Larry, I know exactly
what it is I'm doing,
so just relax.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:27.811
Go back to the table,
finish this up, okay?
Meet me back here soon.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:32.879
Well, Grace,
think of what you're doing.
I mean, it's... it's a sin.

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:40.486
Ohh.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:45.692
It'll never come off.

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.110
Oh, shit.
Dropped my "pneumonia. "

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.518
Hey, wait a minute.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:12.760
All right.
You stay out here.
Are you crazy?

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.993
That guy hates my guts.
He's not gonna do anything...
not for me.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.558
No, but he might do it for me.

01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:24.774
Three Beatles took a tour
of Central Park yesterday...

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.709
while George stayed in bed
nursing a sore throat.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:31.407
<i>Reports are that George...
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
I was watching that.</i>

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:34.883
Sorry about that. It's showtime.
But you don't seem
to understand.

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:39.821
<i>The Ed Sullivan Show
is gonna be on.
Honey, we all got our problems.</i>

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:44.122
When that show goes on in there,
that tube goes off. It's union rules.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:48.062
Ohh. Well, how long
does this go on?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.692
Midnight.

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:53.134
Want another one?

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:05.874
To hell with it.
I don't wanna hear about it.
Wait! I'll tell ya! Just listen!

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.077
This guy is the kid's father.
In his wallet are tickets
to the Beatles show.

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:11.587
That's all we want.
You can have his money.
What did you say?

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:13.589
I said you can
have all his money.
No, no, no, no.

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:17.821
<i>You said something about tickets.
Tickets to The Ed Sullivan Show.
That's all we want.</i>

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:20.864
How many tickets has he got?
Three.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.505
I'll do it,
but I get one of the tickets.

01:03:29.573 --> 01:03:33.441
I'm sorry, really I am.
It was just an accident.
I didn't wanna come up here...

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:35.501
and get in trouble
or anything like that.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:38.377
I didn't even wanna
come here today.
They made me do it.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:41.315
This is very unlike me.
I mean, I just don't
do things like this,

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.979
and it's all
just very confusing for me.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:48.457
You've gotta
believe me, please.
I believe ya. It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:51.153
Look, everything's
gonna be all right.

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.992
Now, you got somebody
you can call to come
and pick you up?

01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:57.556
There's a phone over there.
Why don't you go over
and use it?

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:01.903
Sergeant.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:04.304
Look at this crap.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.105
Is that the bird
that was under Lennon's bed?
Bird?

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.112
Girl.
Girl. Girl. That's her.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.343
Well, I just spoke to Brian.
It's very important we keep her
here for a while, okay?

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.351
No sweat.
I beg your pardon?

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:20.186
Uh, no problem.
Hello? Eddie?
Can you come and get me, please?

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.793
<i># The best things in life
are free #</i>

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.389
<i>#But you can keep 'em
for the birds and bees #</i>

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:33.368
<i>#Now, give me money #
# That's what I want #</i>

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:37.100

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:40.803

<i># That's what I want #</i>

<i># Your lovin'give me a thrill #</i>

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.915
<i>#But your lovin'
don't pay my bills #</i>

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:55.618
<i>#Now, give me money #

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.423
<i># That's what I want #

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:04.263
<i># That's what I want

# That's what I want #</i>

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:07.997
<i># That's what I want ##</i>

01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:32.420
<i>What?</i>

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.616
Trapped like a rat.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:35.989
Now, wait a minute. I said
I'd get my hair cut, but you don't
expect me to pay for it, do ya?

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:42.558
Okay. And don't forget
to bring the tickets.

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:46.427
It's all set.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:53.733
<i>Going up?</i>

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:56.779
Seven, please.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:07:00.783
#There's a place
There's a place #

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:05.481
Hey, baby, this is the "K."
I'm interrupting my own show to bring you
an important Beatles bulletin.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:09.514
<i>I just discovered another pair
of Ed Sullivan tickets
I forgot to give away.</i>

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.584
Now, even though
we're only a few minutes
away from showtime,

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:15.392
the folks over there at CBS
tell me you can still get in
even if you're a few minutes late,

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:18.923
provided, of course, you answer
our countdown question correctly.

01:07:19.002 --> 01:07:21.095
Please! Hurry!
Get me to seven!

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:25.699
If you live out on the Island,
Westchester County, Jersey, wherever,
don't call in if you can't make the show.

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:28.267
All right. Here we go
with a very tough Beatles question.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:33.305
Which particular Beatle
is at the same time the oldest
and youngest member...

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:39.083
Ohh!
# I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man #

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:42.683
# I wanna be your lover, baby #
Ow! Ooh!

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:46.320
Sorry.
# Love you like no other, baby #

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.762
<i>#Like no other can #</i>

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:53.860
<i>#Love you like no other, baby
like no other can #</i>

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.030
<i>#I wanna be your man #</i>

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:59.667
<i>#I wanna be your man #
Oh, please, God. Let me get through.
Please let me get through.</i>

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:06.045
Yo. Which Beatle
is the oldest and youngest?

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:09.142
Ringo?
Wait a minute.
Ringo?

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:11.244
Yes.
That's right!

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:14.017
Your tickets will be waiting for you
at the Ed Sullivan theater.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.286
What's your name, baby?
What's your name?

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.725
Rosie!
It's Rosie Petrofsky!

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:21.024
All right, Rosie! You're a winner!
Congratulations!

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:23.589
Oh, thank you!
Thank you very much!

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:26.363
Thank you for
letting me use your phone.

01:08:30.173 --> 01:08:34.473
I won.
# I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man #

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:41.408
Oh... Oh!

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:51.658
- Lobby, please.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:54.162

<i>#Love you like no other, baby ##</i>

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:10.107
What's wrong? What's wrong
with this elevator?

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.978
You!
Hi, Rosie.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.984
You busted it!
You broke the elevator!

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:20.648
Calm down. Relax. I'll have it fixed
in a jiffy. I know everything there is
to know about elevators.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:26.358
You broke it.
You broke it on purpose!
Wait a minute. I know.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:30.832
Just let me fix this here.
Help!
Get us out of here!

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:33.734
We're trapped!
Oh, I'm ruined!

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:36.738
My whole life is ruined!

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:41.004
Don't worry.
I'll get us out of this mess. Somebody
from the hotel is bound to save us.

01:09:41.077 --> 01:09:46.379
They'll come and rescue us
just like the cavalry. Don't worry.
It's not like we're gonna suffocate.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.350
There's plenty of fresh air.

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:54.215
Oh, before I forget...
Here's a little something for you
on behalf of the boys and myself,

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.919
just to show
there are no hard feelings.

01:09:56.993 --> 01:10:01.521
It's a pass to the boys' performance
on the telly tonight.
Oh, my God.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:04.795
Thank you.
Oh, by the way, there are some members
of the press downstairs.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:09.737
They'd like to chat
with you a bit. You don't
have any objections, do you?

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.468
Reporters? Well...
Well, what do they wanna
talk to me for?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:14.669
They just wanna
ask you a few questions.

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:19.504
<i>You must be Al. Hi. I'm Cindy.
Hi, Cindy. I'm glad you could make it.</i>

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.813
<i>Uh, can I...
can I take your coat?</i>

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.819
<i>Yeah. Sure.
Can I fix you a drink?</i>

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.879
A Coke, please.
Man Announcing]

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:30.017
Well, what kind of party
do you have in mind, Al?

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:35.156
Well, uh, actually, Cindy,
it was more like a picnic.

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.325
Look at that.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.302
All right. She's probably
gonna end up in one of those houses.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:44.534
She is gonna end up
in one of those houses.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:47.441
It's all your fault.

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:57.075
Hey. Here she comes.
How 'bout a big smile for the camera?

01:10:57.153 --> 01:11:00.816
There you go.
How does it feel
to be in the limelight?

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:05.918
Would you do it again?
I don't know. I didn't...

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:08.897
Hold it right there.
That's it. Thank you.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:14.528
<i>Different generation here.</i>

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:20.207
Okay. Could the people
in the front please sit down
for the benefit of those in the back?

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:23.371
Thank you. Now, I'd like
to introduce you to the young lady...

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.506
I told you about: Miss Pam Mitchell.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:29.450
<i>How does it feel to be the number-one
Beatle fan in New York?</i>

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:41.486
<i>Miss Mitchell?
Miss Mitchell?</i>

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:45.056
Millions of young girls
across the country dream about
what you've done today.

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.501
Perhaps you'd like to tell them...
How did you feel...

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:51.700
actually being
in the Beatles' hotel room?

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.800
Well, I, um...

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:58.713
It's kind of hard
to put into words, but...

01:11:58.782 --> 01:12:02.274
I guess it... it was...

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.987
it was wonderful,

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:10.754
The most wonderful feeling
I've ever had in my life.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.490
<i>Al, would you mind
if I switched to Ed Sullivan?
'Cause the Beatles are gonna be on.</i>

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:17.192
I don't... care.
Anything you want.
Thanks.

01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:20.134
Try to land one of these.
Static]

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:25.368
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Yeah.
Something really nice happened here.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:30.744
The Beatles got a real kick out of it
because we received a wire...
or they did...

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:33.749
from Elvis Presley
and Colonel Tom Parker...

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:37.378
wishing them
the most tremendous success
in our country.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:40.548
I think that was really,
really, really nice.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:43.717
Now, you know,
this particular season has seen
many, many exciting acts,

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:48.526
<i>like the Little Italian Mouse,
Topo Gigio, Belgium's Singing Nun,
Sister Sourire...</i>

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:54.298
Well, kid, looks like your old man
really stuck it to ya this time.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:57.135
<i>The Sullivan show's already started.
You may as well go home.</i>

01:12:57.207 --> 01:13:01.075
Oh, no. They'll let us in,
even if we're late, just so long
as we've got the tickets, okay?

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:07.483
Give you one of my genuine
Beatles bedsheets. You can have a Paul.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:11.111
<i>I'm gonna miss
The Ed Sullivan Show.
No.</i>

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:13.678
<i>There's no way we can miss
The Ed Sullivan Show.
I know where there's a TV,</i>

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.691
and besides,
the Beatles are the last act.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:19.160
They always save the best acts for last.
That way you have to sit through
all the commercials.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.596
I got tickets
to see 'em in person!

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:24.826
I won 'em on the radio!

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.836
Yeah, well,
that's what I was saying.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.135
We're... No... Wait...
We're trapped!

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:35.007
Oh, please, get us out!
Somebody save us!
We're trapped like rats!

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.278
That's right. Clear out.
All right. Get back.

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:42.375
All right. Hold it down.
Open up.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:45.751
Pam, did you touch them? Can I
touch you where you touched them?
I didn't touch them.

01:13:45.822 --> 01:13:47.790
Can I have your autograph?
Sure.

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:52.021
<i>- Pam, can we have your autograph?
- Sign my cast.</i>

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:57.364
<i>You'd better hurry
if you wanna see the show.
Can I touch you?</i>

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:04.038
Excuse me.
Bye.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.667
Bye-bye. Take care.
Bye.

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:09.678
Who's that guy?
Oh, that's Neil.
He's really nice. You'd like him.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:12.442
Yeah. Let's go. You had me worried;
I hope you know that.
I'm sorry,

01:14:12.515 --> 01:14:14.574
but today
was just so incredibly important...

01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:18.246
I'm gonna let it go this time,
but you are going to have to start
acting a little more responsible.

01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:21.188
You're hurting me.

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:24.522
Pam, where's my ring?

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:26.585
What?
My ring.

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:31.066
A paid a hundred and...
I paid $175 for that ring.
Where is it?

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:35.503
It's, um... It's in my shoe.
I put it in my shoe.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:39.941
Well, get it the hell out of your shoe.
I just thought that would be the safest place
for it when I was running around here.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:44.878
<i>I couldn't think
of anything else to do with it,
because I lost my purse on our way here.</i>

01:14:44.948 --> 01:14:49.510
It was just in the car,
and I'm sorry. L...
Come on. Let's get outta here.

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:56.583
Hey. Psst. There he is.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:17.235
Hey, watch where you're walkin'!
This is a free country.
I can walk where I want!

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:19.781
Then walk on the expressway!

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.778
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Wait a minute. Got the tickets?

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.288
<i>Of course I got the tickets!</i>

01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:31.316
Come on. Let me see 'em.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.732
There ain't no tickets
in here!
Look!

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:43.337
Now, come on.
Let's go.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:50.205
No. Dad!

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.805
<i>No.</i>

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:59.053
<i>No.</i>

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:10.030
- Dad! Oh, Dad!
- Now, sit in there!

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:13.364
<i>I said sit in there!
Oh, Jesus. No.</i>

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:18.240
I said stay in that chair.
Do you wanna see that show
or don't you?

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:22.642
Look at that. You ever
see a haircut like that before?
Uh-uh.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:25.704
Isn't that something? How would
you like to have a kid like that?
Uh-uh.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:29.411
Got into town last night,
and I saw him from the back...
I thought it was my daughter.

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:32.852
Mm.
I told him, "If you don't get a haircut,
you'll have to wear a sign. "

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.288
That somethin'?

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.452
Mm-hmm.
All right then. Go to work.

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.163
All right.
Now, just take it easy.
Nobody's gonna hurt ya.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:46.395
Now, be a man,
and everything'll be fine.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:51.899
Aah.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:10.822
All right, kid.
How do ya want it?

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:15.660
I want him to look
like a marine.

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:52.258
<i>- Oh, my God!
He's just been hit by a bus!</i>

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:55.304
L... I think he's in shock!

01:17:55.371 --> 01:18:00.001
Mister, please. Can I use your coat?
We've gotta keep him covered.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:08.008
- He looks bad. You'd better give him
some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:10.780
Uh, right. Uh, could
you call an ambulance,
please?

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.947
There's a phone booth
right outside.
Okay. Okay.
Give him some mouth-to-mouth.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.287
Did you hear what I said?
Give him some mouth-to-mouth.

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:25.799
<i>More oxygen!</i>

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:39.809
- Oh, great. Come on.
- What the...

01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:49.182
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:51.954
Aah. It's dead.
It's completely dead,

01:18:52.028 --> 01:18:54.622
just like everything else
in this roach trap.

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:57.996
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:03.334
It's because I'm being punished.
I'm being punished because
I missed Mass this morning.

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.800
Hey. A trapdoor.
Of course! A trapdoor!

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:13.212
All elevators have to have trapdoors;
that's the law. With this, you can
crawl to the fifth floor!

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:16.376
Oh, no. You'd better not.
That looks awful dangerous.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.012
Dangerous?
Why, this isn't dangerous.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.387
I'll tell you what's dangerous...
the time I got thrown
off the Long Island Railroad.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:27.020
Now, that was dangerous.
This isn't even moving!

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:43.173
No. That's what I was afraid of...
a safety interlock.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:45.407
We'll never
get these doors open.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:49.941
Oh, it's hopeless.
The show's already started.
We may as well forget about it.

01:19:50.019 --> 01:19:54.080
Forget about it?
Forget about the Beatles?
What, are you screwy or somethin'?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:57.649
What else can we do?
We've tried everything else.

01:19:57.727 --> 01:20:00.890
It's only two-eighths-inched
plate glass.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:06.731
These doors are pretty flimsy,
like everything else in this fleabag.
So?

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:14.302
Come on!

01:20:14.377 --> 01:20:17.312
What are you waitin' for?

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:27.051
<i>Just think. In a couple ofhours,
you're gonna be Mrs. Eddie Lupus.</i>

01:20:28.724 --> 01:20:32.251
Mrs. Eddie Lupus.
I like the way that sounds.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:35.627
<i>Hey, it's gonna
be a great life for us, Mrs. Lupus.</i>

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:41.159
<i>And why shouldn't it be?
I've got a greatjob. Heck, I'm in on
the ground floor of somethin'really big.</i>

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:45.571
These plastic furniture covers
are the thing of the future.
We'll have to skimp the first few years...

01:20:45.641 --> 01:20:49.407
<i>and we won't be able
to go out much, but who cares?</i>

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:54.711
<i>We'll have each other.
Mr. And Mrs. Eddie Lupus,
till death us do part.</i>

01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:57.617
- I'd rather see the Beatles.
- What?

01:20:57.687 --> 01:21:00.850
- Eddie, stop the car. I wanna get out.
- What are you talking about?

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:04.950
I've got this ticket to see the Beatles,
and I don't wanna miss it.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:10.863
- We're getting married.
- I can't do it, Eddie.
I can't marry you.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:14.892
- What did you say?
- I just can't marry you.
I don't want to anymore.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.303
Pam, what the hell have you
been doing here in New York?

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:22.572
- I've just realized that there are
more things in life for me besides marriage.
- More thing... Like what?

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:25.910
Like the Beatles.
Pamela!

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:28.815
Pamela! You come back here!
Did you hear me?

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.080
<i>Did you hear me?
Come back here!</i>

01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:36.090
<i>Woman Narrating, Indistinct]
[Al]
More, more. Oh, yeah.</i>

01:21:36.158 --> 01:21:40.288
<i>Faster, faster, faster.
When it's least expected, you're the star.</i>

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:44.356
<i>- Don't miss Candid Camera tonight
at 10:00, 9:00 Central, here on CBS.
- Ooh, yeah.</i>

01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:46.663
<i>Candid Camera. That's it!</i>

01:21:46.736 --> 01:21:51.605
Come on, Larry.
Come on.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.957
Hey, Tony, what are you really
gonna do with that ticket?

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:13.552
I told ya. I'm gonna scalp it.
Do you mind?

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:17.360
You know, Rosie could
really use that ticket. If you're
just gonna sell it to some stranger...

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:22.427
<i>Look, how am I supposed to
find Rosie? You want Rosie to have
a ticket, you go find her and give her yours.</i>

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:26.601
<i>Oh, my God! That's her!
She's here! Rosie! Hey, Rosie!</i>

01:22:26.676 --> 01:22:29.167
Janis!
Wait a minute!

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:33.011
I won tickets on the ra...
You won 'em too! Oh!

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.209
Come on!

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.514
<i>And now,
right now, from Paris, France,
Good. Rub it in. Rub it in.</i>

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:43.081
<i>- Faster. Faster. Oh!
- here is Pierre Porlier
and his performing poodles.</i>

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:46.151
So let's really bring them on
with a nice welcome, shall we? Come on.

01:22:58.074 --> 01:23:00.508
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:03.101
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:06.706
<i>Hey!
Excuse me.</i>

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:12.251
Pam!
Rosie!

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.585
What are you doing here?
Oh, I got this ticket.

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:18.115
Hey, get these mongrels
off the stage! We wanna see
some real entertainment.

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:20.162
I hate dogs,
and I always have.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.903
<i>Ohh!</i>

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.208
<i>That's good. Oh... Ooh.
Faster. Faster. Faster.</i>

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:45.185
Oh, that's good.
Now, get the ketchup. Get the ketchup.

01:23:45.254 --> 01:23:48.314
Put a little ketchup
on the side. Ketchup.

01:23:48.391 --> 01:23:51.292
<i>Smile. You're on Candid Camera!</i>

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.920
Hey! Hey!
Watch the birdie!
Say "cheese"!

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:56.055
- What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doin'?
- Look. Don't worry.

01:23:56.132 --> 01:24:00.501
I'll have these proofs sent to your house,
and you and your wife can select the prints
you'd like at your own convenience.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:03.629
- What are you doin' to me?
What do you want?
- If you prefer to have the negatives...

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:07.506
processed somewhere else, I'd be
more than happy to sell them to you
at the incredible discount rate...

01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:09.669
<i>of only $50.</i>

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:12.475
- Fifty bucks? That's blackmail!
- Look, Al, I happen to be in a hurry.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:15.540
Fine. Okay. Okay.
Fifty bucks.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.654
Smart move, Al.

01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:23.886
You're never gonna regret this.
You know, I'm lettin' you off easy.

01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:26.553
<i>Here's your film, Al.</i>

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:32.067
You're not goin' anywhere
with my money.

01:24:32.134 --> 01:24:34.625
No! No! No!

01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:42.037
Get your goddamn hands
off her, you...

01:24:42.111 --> 01:24:44.238
Audience Applauds]

01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:48.713
Oh, Larry,
you were just wonderful!

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:52.618
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:24:52.688 --> 01:24:57.148
<i>Just... Just sensational.
I'll be right back with the Beatles...</i>

01:24:57.226 --> 01:24:59.456
<i>after this word about Aeroshave.</i>

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:03.259
Now, ladies and gentlemen
here in the studio audience,

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:07.200
right after these commercial announcements,
we're going to bring out the Beatles.

01:25:11.307 --> 01:25:16.768
<i>All right now.
Just simmer down.
Simmer down. Relax.</i>

01:25:16.846 --> 01:25:19.644
<i>Let's just try
to take it easy.</i>

01:25:23.519 --> 01:25:26.488
Shit!

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:29.422
This thing handles pretty well.

01:25:31.327 --> 01:25:36.196
Now, I wanna remind you...
all you people... to keep your seats.

01:25:36.265 --> 01:25:38.563
Remain seated
for the entire show.

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:43.628
All of you stay in your seats,
especially you folks up there
in the balcony.

01:25:43.706 --> 01:25:48.143
You... young man up there...
would you please sit down there,
please?

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.610
<i>Who, me?
Yes, you.</i>

01:25:50.679 --> 01:25:53.648
<i>Now, will you please
take off that ridiculous hat?</i>

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:56.446
- Okay, Ed.
- How can people behind s...

01:25:56.519 --> 01:25:58.987
be able to see
with that ridiculous hat on there?

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:04.151
<i>All right, Ed.
Please. Let's have
no more outbursts like that.</i>

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:06.990
<i>Let's set a nice example...
Would you like me
to take my coat off too?</i>

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:10.361
All right. Take that off, too,
but sit down, please.

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:13.094
Jesus Christ.

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:16.195
Whoo-hoo!

01:26:23.279 --> 01:26:25.839
Come on! What do you think this is,
a funeral or somethin'?

01:26:25.915 --> 01:26:30.352
Larry, it's a red light!

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:33.183
I can see it's a red light!

01:26:36.192 --> 01:26:39.389
<i>We want the Beatles! We want the Beatles!
Now, you promised.</i>

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:43.921
<i>You promised.
Look, so far tonight,
you've all been very well behaved.</i>

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:48.459
<i>Now, let's not spoil it.
I don't wanna have to bring
a barber out here.</i>

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:52.132
<i>That's right. I've got a barber
standing byjust in case.</i>

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:56.042
<i>He's gonna come out
and clip those youngsters
with his clipper.</i>

01:26:56.111 --> 01:26:59.774
<i>I'm not kidding.
# Brylcreem, a little dab'll do ya #</i>

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:02.510
# Brylcreem, you look so debonair #

01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:07.113
# Brylcreem, the gals'll all pursue ya #

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:09.657
#They love to get their fingers
in your hair ##

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:16.728
You nitwit!

01:27:18.534 --> 01:27:21.162
Serves you right, you moron!

01:27:24.273 --> 01:27:28.107
As pain mounts up,
you feel dull, depressed, nerves on edge.
Please get those title cards in focus.

01:27:28.177 --> 01:27:30.907
<i>You can't read this shit.
How do I know which one's Ringo?</i>

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.143
<i>I think he plays the guitar.
What guitar?
There's three guitars.</i>

01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:38.414
<i>Jesus Christ. I've got a headache
that's gonna slam through my ears.
Where the hell is Ed?</i>

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.520
It's a one-way street!
I'm only goin' one way.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:40.437
You got the 50?

01:28:40.516 --> 01:28:42.609
Yeah.
Come on.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.820
All right, kid.
You're goin' down a one-way street
the wrong way.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:21.947
Let me see your license.

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:26.961
I haven't got a license.
You don't have a license, huh?
Then who belongs to this car?

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:29.896
- It's my father's.
- Okay, kid.

01:29:29.965 --> 01:29:33.128
You're gonna have to go down
to the station house and call your old man
from there. Out of the car.

01:29:33.202 --> 01:29:37.730
<i>Excuse me.
Excuse me, Officer.
This kid here...</i>

01:29:37.806 --> 01:29:41.401
This kid, he's...
he's my boyfriend,

01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:44.344
and, um,
I was just wondering...

01:29:44.413 --> 01:29:47.473
if there's any other way we could
take care of this.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:50.416
Driving without a license
is a very serious offense.

01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:53.512
I know, Officer,
but, uh,

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:59.152
you think his fine
would be more than $50?

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:04.430
<i>That sounds about right.</i>

01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:14.843
Well, um, Officer,

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.902
my friend and I were both
really in kind of a hurry.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:22.144
And I was wondering...
if we were to pay you the fine
right now,

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:26.119
do you think you could
take care of it for us?

01:30:26.188 --> 01:30:30.625
Well, it's an irregular procedure,
but in this case,
I'll make an exception.

01:30:30.692 --> 01:30:33.456
Thank you.

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:39.395
- All right, kid.
I'm gonna give you a break this time.
- Thank you, sir.

01:30:39.468 --> 01:30:42.562
But let this be a lesson to ya.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:51.443
- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Forget it.

01:30:51.513 --> 01:30:54.243
<i>And, you know,
all day yesterday and today,</i>

01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:57.308
<i>the theater's been absolutelyjammed
with newspapermen...
Oh, my God.</i>

01:30:57.386 --> 01:31:00.082
<i>I'm gonna see Paul.
And photographers, and they all agree
there has never been anything...</i>

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:02.316
<i>like the excitement caused by these...
I'm gonna see Paul right here.</i>

01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:07.055
Stand by. One minute. When they come out
there, I want you to keep that audio down,
mister. I don't wanna see that needle...

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:17.904
<i>Tony! Tony, don't do it!</i>

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:23.067
Janis, what the hell
do ya think you're doin'?

01:31:23.145 --> 01:31:26.342
- What do you think you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing.

01:31:26.415 --> 01:31:29.077
I'm puttin' an end
to this Beatles bullshit
once and for all.

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:34.612
That's crazy, Tony!
You could get electrocuted!
You could blow this whole building up!

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:37.454
You might even get killed!

01:31:37.526 --> 01:31:40.393
Yeah? Well,
what about that scuzzy hair?

01:31:40.462 --> 01:31:44.125
- What if everybody starts
runnin' around lookin' like that?
- Oh, please, Tony! Please!

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:49.136
- Just listen to me for a minute.
- Forget it, Janis! Fifty million TV sets
are all gonna go black,

01:31:49.204 --> 01:31:53.436
and there ain't a damn thing
that you or anybody else
can do about it!

01:32:02.284 --> 01:32:04.514
Okay! All right!

01:32:04.586 --> 01:32:07.316
You want 'em?
You got 'em. You got 'em.

01:32:08.924 --> 01:32:10.653
Oh, shit!

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:15.055
So now, ladies and gentlemen,
here they are... the Beatles!

01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:20.397
- # She loves you
yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:32:20.469 --> 01:32:23.495
# She loves you

#You think you've lost your love #

01:32:32.281 --> 01:32:35.580
#Well, I saw her yesterday #

01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:41.214
<i>#It's you she's thinkin'of
and she told me what to say #</i>

01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:43.349
<i>#She says she loves you #</i>

01:32:43.425 --> 01:32:47.919
#And you know that can't be bad #

01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:52.990
<i># Yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad #</i>

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:57.764
# She said you hurt her so #

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:00.967
# She almost lost her mind #

01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:04.035
# But now she says she knows #

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:06.945
#You're not the hurting kind #

01:33:07.015 --> 01:33:12.920
# She says she loves you
and you know that can't be bad #

01:33:12.988 --> 01:33:18.449
<i># Yes, she loves you

01:33:18.527 --> 01:33:23.123
#Whoo
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:33:23.198 --> 01:33:25.564
<i>#She loves you

01:33:25.634 --> 01:33:30.333
#And with a love like that
you know you should be glad #

01:33:31.974 --> 01:33:35.341
#You know it's up to you #

01:33:35.410 --> 01:33:38.470
# I think it's only fair #

01:33:38.547 --> 01:33:41.710
#And pride can hurt you too #

01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:44.775
#Apologize to her #

01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:49.722
<i>#Because she loves you
and you know that can't be bad #</i>

01:33:51.393 --> 01:33:56.023
<i>#She loves you

<i># Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ##</i>

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.548
I can't believe this.

01:34:55.757 --> 01:34:59.750
<i>I'm gonna
dedicate all those fine songs...</i>

01:34:59.828 --> 01:35:03.389
<i>toJohnny Carson, Randy Parr
and Earl Wilson.</i>

01:35:03.465 --> 01:35:06.491
Just a reminder: The Beatles'll
be back next week from Miami Beach.

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:11.028
Also, the fabulous Budapest Ballerinas,
a young impressionist who does
a great impression of me...

01:35:11.106 --> 01:35:13.574
WillJordan...
and a host of many,
many fine acts.

01:35:13.642 --> 01:35:17.669
- Please drive carefully, and we'll see you
again next week. Good night. Good night.
- Rosie. Rosie.

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:20.874
Rosie. Rosie.

01:35:20.949 --> 01:35:23.577
What happened?
What happened?

01:35:23.652 --> 01:35:29.090
Rosie, you fainted.
You missed the whole show.

01:35:30.826 --> 01:35:33.192
I know.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:36.094
It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.
Forget it. Forget it.

01:35:36.164 --> 01:35:38.394
You could've got your pictures,
and it's all my fault.
Oh, for goodness sakes.

01:35:38.467 --> 01:35:42.130
Let's just forget it, okay?
Let's not even talk about it anymore.

01:35:42.204 --> 01:35:45.298
Why don't we talk
about something else?

01:35:45.373 --> 01:35:49.434
Why don't we talk
about that dance Friday night,
Larry?

01:35:49.511 --> 01:35:54.210
What time
you wanna pick me up?
You wanna go to the dance with me?

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:56.250
Sure.
Yeah?

01:35:56.318 --> 01:35:58.946
- So then you're asking me?
- Yeah.

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:02.820
Yeah. Yeah.
The Valentine's Dance, huh?

01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:05.883
That'll be a gas.

01:36:09.197 --> 01:36:12.689
- Here comes the fuzz.
I'm gonna be sick.

01:36:15.137 --> 01:36:17.469
Lookit.
You're on my hands.
I'm not on your hands.

01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:20.440
<i>- This isn't the right car.
- This isn't the right car.</i>

01:36:20.509 --> 01:36:23.706
<i>There it is! Their car!
Never mind.</i>

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.713
<i>What are you staring at?
Get these boys out ofhere.</i>

01:36:25.781 --> 01:36:28.579
- Sure, mister. Sure.
- Did you hear me?
For God's sake, get these boys out of here...

01:36:28.650 --> 01:36:31.949
before they're trampled to death.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.284
<i>Drive, Larry. Drive!</i>

01:36:38.193 --> 01:36:42.562
<i>Oh, great.</i>

01:36:42.631 --> 01:36:45.065
<i>Come on. Come on, driver.
Would you give me a break?</i>

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.125
<i>Pull the choke.</i>

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:59.139
<i>Look! There they go!
Hey, wait a minute.</i>

01:36:59.214 --> 01:37:02.877
<i>That limo's gotJersey plates.</i>

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:05.078
Nah. Couldn't be.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:08.213
<i>#She loves you
yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:11.316
