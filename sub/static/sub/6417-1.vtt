01:33.827 --> 01:36.728
We've read Yu Qiuyu's
"The Messenger" last week

01:36.796 --> 01:39.390
Let's read his

01:39.566 --> 01:42.763
"Weight of Thirty Years" today

01:43.002 --> 01:45.470
Please turn to page 431

01:46.506 --> 01:48.701
Among the unending phone calls

01:48.842 --> 01:52.903
I suddenly hear the voice of an old man

01:53.446 --> 01:55.505
It's my Chinese teacher

01:55.648 --> 01:59.709
...from high school 30 years ago
Mr. Mu Ni

01:59.919 --> 02:01.477
It was lost during the Cultural Revolution

02:01.821 --> 02:05.279
The old man said
Can you draw me another one?

02:05.492 --> 02:07.585
For my collection when I am old?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.853
Memories of the early sixties appear

02:10.029 --> 02:13.021
High school life was tough but happy

02:13.166 --> 02:15.327
The children knew by instinct

02:15.535 --> 02:16.399
these teachers

02:16.536 --> 02:20.495
...were under political pressure

02:20.740 --> 02:24.141
We couldn't afford
New Year greeting cards

02:24.310 --> 02:26.744
We could only draw
our own on blank paper

02:27.447 --> 02:29.938
No matter what we wrote
or what we drew

02:30.116 --> 02:33.108
it was no better than any other student

02:33.353 --> 02:36.015
We've already forgotten
the way we used to draw

02:36.523 --> 02:39.253
We can only use the hands
of two middle-aged men

02:39.459 --> 02:42.826
to roll up 30 years of
sweetness and bitterness

02:43.062 --> 02:45.929
to let you feel the great love that lasts

02:46.166 --> 02:50.603
Yu Qiuyu's "The Weight of Thirty Years"

02:51.604 --> 02:53.265
Think of the time

02:53.473 --> 02:56.306
when you feel the weight

02:56.576 --> 02:59.238
This is the topic for
this week's assignment

02:59.812 --> 03:02.246
Good-bye. Good-bye

04:32.639 --> 04:33.936
Miss, what are you doing?

04:34.140 --> 04:35.630
You haven't paid yet

04:44.150 --> 04:45.344
I'm sorry

04:45.985 --> 04:49.546
She's my sister. I'm paying for her

05:06.539 --> 05:09.406
Hello. Yes, I'll pick her up later

05:09.575 --> 05:12.703
I got some things to do now. Thanks

05:13.913 --> 05:17.440
My name is Yip. I'm out of a job
and I've 2 dogs

05:17.717 --> 05:19.844
They would be starving without me

05:20.086 --> 05:21.383
You ran away from home?

05:23.723 --> 05:27.659
Rosa kicked me out

05:28.895 --> 05:30.089
We had a fight yesterday

05:30.963 --> 05:33.090
I've no choice cause
I was living under her roof

05:34.334 --> 05:37.861
You can't steal stuff
even if you're penniless

05:38.037 --> 05:39.299
Do you have any friends here?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.099
Who cares?

05:42.241 --> 05:43.173
All I want to do is eat!

05:49.315 --> 05:50.680
One coffee, please

06:06.065 --> 06:10.195
(Did others say you look lovely
when you're sleeping? Jin)

06:20.079 --> 06:23.674
Don't you have anything you want to do?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.016
Why does everyone ask me
the same question?

06:28.187 --> 06:29.654
Rosa does it too

06:29.889 --> 06:31.447
She says I'm wasting my time

06:31.657 --> 06:35.559
And that she'll look down
on me too one day

06:35.628 --> 06:38.688
She kicked me out because of the fight

06:39.499 --> 06:42.957
Actually, she cherishes me

06:43.102 --> 06:46.037
But she was too nosy
and always babbling

06:46.339 --> 06:48.432
You are different
You are so soft and gentle

07:15.001 --> 07:18.801
Sorry, I'm treating you like my students

07:20.640 --> 07:23.302
So, tell me one of your secrets
and we'll call it even?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.506
Call it even?

07:47.033 --> 07:50.867
I've never left school for 30 years

07:51.437 --> 07:55.100
From high school to university
to being a teacher

07:55.708 --> 07:59.007
I just go from one school to another

08:01.180 --> 08:02.204
That's not a secret

08:45.558 --> 08:47.924
I used to visit a friend a lot in Macau

08:50.630 --> 08:52.427
She was my best friend

08:54.200 --> 08:55.758
...who became a nun at 23

09:19.892 --> 09:21.757
It'll be hard at times

09:22.762 --> 09:26.755
Just tell me about it
no one would blame you

09:52.792 --> 09:54.953
(Did others say you look lovely
when you're sleeping? Jin)

10:26.692 --> 10:28.660
Cry to me whenever you want to

10:28.794 --> 10:30.318
just treat me to dinner

10:33.933 --> 10:35.264
You can cry as loud as you want

11:28.454 --> 11:29.853
Thank you

11:32.391 --> 11:34.916
The company is nearby

11:35.161 --> 11:36.321
I'll go by myself. No need to wait for me

11:36.696 --> 11:37.492
Bye

12:52.638 --> 12:54.037
How did you find me?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.475
There're only a few girls' school

12:57.676 --> 12:58.904
in this area

13:01.313 --> 13:02.541
You have to read it

13:38.584 --> 13:41.018
Hurry up! Come on, hurry up!

13:41.187 --> 13:43.155
Wait for me

13:43.622 --> 13:45.317
It's raining

13:45.724 --> 13:46.520
Really?

13:49.028 --> 13:49.790
Look

13:59.004 --> 14:01.302
I don't feel it. I'm not a lamp post

14:12.351 --> 14:13.113
That tastes sour

14:22.795 --> 14:25.923
I'm back at Rosa's place
I wanted to return your money

14:26.165 --> 14:28.030
But then I decided to
make you dinner instead

14:28.267 --> 14:29.256
How about this Saturday?

14:29.401 --> 14:31.062
You can bring Ting Ting along

14:31.570 --> 14:34.471
And yes, you asked me
what I wanted to do?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.870
There are two things I wanted to do

14:38.177 --> 14:39.041
Find a girl

14:39.144 --> 14:41.874
and a suitable job

14:42.181 --> 14:44.615
I don't think I have to tell
anyone about this

14:44.884 --> 14:46.977
And I'm not sure when I can succeed

14:47.786 --> 14:50.118
I dreamt about you that night

14:50.322 --> 14:52.085
If you want to know about my dream

14:52.324 --> 14:53.882
you'll have to come on Saturday

14:54.460 --> 14:55.427
Come on, hurry up

15:08.607 --> 15:10.370
You live here alone?

16:03.228 --> 16:07.221
Get up! Hurry, I want you to see this

16:07.666 --> 16:09.065
Get up!

16:09.435 --> 16:10.459
I'm very tired

16:11.503 --> 16:12.492
Hurry up!

18:14.460 --> 18:17.054
Hello, Hello

18:17.463 --> 18:18.987
Rosa, who is it?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.390
I don't know

18:44.423 --> 18:46.914
I'm having dinner with my friends
from university on Saturday

18:47.126 --> 18:50.254
I'll bring Ting Ting along
and be back a bit late

18:51.029 --> 18:52.929
Great, go and have fun

18:55.100 --> 18:57.091
Go and do some shopping

18:57.336 --> 19:00.772
You haven't bought yourself
anything for some time

19:04.543 --> 19:06.943
What? Eat

19:29.101 --> 19:34.198
When butterflies fly away

19:34.439 --> 19:38.967
So does the heart

19:39.578 --> 19:46.142
In the long night who shall come

19:46.952 --> 19:52.185
To dry a face full of tears

19:53.025 --> 19:59.157
Yearning for a little dependence

19:59.298 --> 20:04.565
Yearning for a little love

20:04.903 --> 20:11.706
An old acquaintance is too hard to end

20:12.110 --> 20:17.571
Resulting in a heart full of grief

20:18.517 --> 20:23.580
How can one endure

20:23.889 --> 20:26.153
The guessing here, the blaming there

20:26.425 --> 20:31.453
When I was thirteen
I slept with a girl one day

20:37.035 --> 20:38.696
She smelled so good

20:41.039 --> 20:42.666
...and was holding me all along

20:43.775 --> 20:45.072
Then

20:48.180 --> 20:50.774
I put my hand inside her body

20:53.785 --> 20:56.083
And she started to cry

21:02.928 --> 21:04.691
That's the only thing I know how to do

21:19.244 --> 21:21.144
I thought about it for a long time

21:23.415 --> 21:24.973
And I'm still afraid to tell you

21:27.586 --> 21:28.883
Because I don't want you to be angry

21:29.921 --> 21:32.185
You only treat me as a good friend

21:35.560 --> 21:40.293
And now I'm totally lost

21:42.768 --> 21:45.328
I've hinted at it many times already

21:47.105 --> 21:51.041
I had no idea
Nobody ever treated me like this

22:32.818 --> 22:34.080
What is it?

22:36.088 --> 22:37.214
A birthmark

22:39.157 --> 22:40.681
You were here all along

23:50.162 --> 23:51.129
What?

23:53.532 --> 23:56.000
You've been acting strange lately

23:57.836 --> 24:00.703
Is it because I was always
working and neglected you?

25:07.739 --> 25:09.206
Bye-bye, Miss Wu Bye-bye

25:40.405 --> 25:42.703
Bye-bye, see you tomorrow

25:58.156 --> 25:59.418
Deedee. Mocha

26:03.295 --> 26:05.889
This is Deedee and this is Mocha

26:06.464 --> 26:09.092
They just look fierce
but are actually very timid

26:09.301 --> 26:10.700
I found them in the streets

26:12.370 --> 26:13.598
I prepared a lot of food

26:22.147 --> 26:24.115
Didn't you say this is Rosa's home?

26:24.482 --> 26:26.245
Where is she?

26:27.018 --> 26:28.952
That's what you've been
worrying about?

26:29.387 --> 26:32.015
Rosa is busy right now at her boutique

26:32.357 --> 26:34.416
And I told her you'll be coming

26:34.626 --> 26:36.025
Someone will bring us a cake later

26:38.930 --> 26:41.160
Didn't I mention it's my birthday today?

26:41.766 --> 26:44.098
You only said that you'd tell me about

26:44.402 --> 26:45.426
about my dream

26:49.608 --> 26:53.339
I just want to see you on my birthday

26:53.545 --> 26:55.069
Do you always become
nervous so easily?

27:04.789 --> 27:07.121
Deedee! Mocha! Go inside!

27:12.263 --> 27:13.594
Ting Ting is turning one, right?

27:13.732 --> 27:15.996
Yes. She's learning to walk

27:16.368 --> 27:19.895
She likes music a lot
Especially Nirvana

27:20.405 --> 27:22.566
"Smells like Teen Spirits"

27:23.174 --> 27:24.266
Cool

27:24.476 --> 27:27.843
Ming says babies
can't tell the difference

27:28.013 --> 27:30.038
But I know she can

27:30.181 --> 27:31.671
I believe you

27:32.784 --> 27:36.083
I recognize some words by three

27:36.321 --> 27:38.448
My father didn't believe me.
But my mother knew

27:38.657 --> 27:40.181
She bought me a lot of books

27:40.392 --> 27:43.190
When others were learning words
in primary school

27:43.395 --> 27:45.022
I was already reading Gu Long's novels

27:45.263 --> 27:48.255
Classes were so boring
I started to daydream

27:49.067 --> 27:51.900
I knew nothing about Math
and my schoolwork was terrible

28:17.228 --> 28:19.423
I wanted to kiss you when I first saw you

28:21.032 --> 28:22.431
I was afraid you'd be mad at me

28:22.634 --> 28:24.659
That's why I've come up
with so many excuses

28:32.711 --> 28:33.837
I

28:35.747 --> 28:37.237
I've never been so afraid

28:38.049 --> 28:43.146
I'm married and I have a kid

28:45.323 --> 28:49.692
But I keep thinking about you

28:53.698 --> 28:56.462
It's ok. I won't force you

29:02.941 --> 29:04.203
Let's eat

29:05.443 --> 29:08.003
or I won't be able to control myself

29:24.095 --> 29:26.962
Gosh, you guys are
having a feast without me

29:27.766 --> 29:30.394
You pretty thing!
You must be Flavia, right?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.400
You nasty girl

29:32.604 --> 29:35.266
you dish me right away
when you see pretty woman

29:36.775 --> 29:39.539
I'd better go and feed the baby

29:40.245 --> 29:41.769
Oh she didn't tell me you were a

29:42.981 --> 29:46.041
Well, she's always liked older woman

29:46.751 --> 29:49.311
You left the boutique alone
what are you doing here?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.885
What did I do? I got you a birthday cake

29:53.625 --> 29:57.117
Today's my birthday
Can you just leave me alone?

30:00.198 --> 30:02.325
OK, fine. I'll leave you guys alone

30:05.003 --> 30:06.868
Just don't take advantage
of married women

30:22.420 --> 30:24.047
Don't mind Rosa

30:27.325 --> 30:29.486
This cake looks good!

30:31.196 --> 30:35.360
But she was very angry
How can you treat her like that?

30:36.701 --> 30:39.295
You silly girl. She's not my girlfriend

30:39.737 --> 30:41.796
Every time I bring a girl home
she'll make fun of her

30:42.040 --> 30:43.132
Don't let her bother you

30:55.653 --> 30:58.713
Do you really like older woman?

31:02.460 --> 31:04.758
Did I say I like you?

31:13.104 --> 31:16.267
I've never seen anyone
over 30 who's so shy

31:18.676 --> 31:22.339
You're the second one
The first one became a nun

31:26.885 --> 31:28.409
Jin, I'm coming

31:28.786 --> 31:31.254
Give me a hand, Jin

31:42.533 --> 31:44.194
Were we not having loved ones?
Though only once in a while

31:44.569 --> 31:48.005
Were we not having food for our mouths?
Though it's not enough

31:48.206 --> 31:51.141
Were we not having a place to live in?
Though it smells

31:51.476 --> 31:53.910
Were we not always better
than somebody else?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.746
Tell me when you want to stop

32:50.335 --> 32:51.302
Sorry

32:51.669 --> 32:52.533
It's ok

33:20.031 --> 33:20.998
She's fine

33:36.481 --> 33:38.449
Find a job and forget about me

33:39.384 --> 33:40.942
I don't know what I was doing just now

33:41.753 --> 33:43.243
Just pretend that we never met

33:52.330 --> 33:54.560
We've met and that's a fact
I won't pretend

34:01.506 --> 34:03.838
You can always re-take the exam
if you work hard

34:05.043 --> 34:06.704
I can't do this any longer

34:23.928 --> 34:25.759
I don't want to give up either

36:28.786 --> 36:31.687
Time to wake up!
I'm making you breakfast

37:39.890 --> 37:41.915
How come you seldom talk
about your family?

37:42.960 --> 37:45.087
I talk about them all the time

37:45.596 --> 37:47.359
Flavia, keep this for me

37:47.765 --> 37:49.562
Don't run around
with your wedding dress

37:50.201 --> 37:52.192
Let's give grandpa a kiss

37:52.403 --> 37:54.030
Just like that. I proposed

37:54.272 --> 37:58.766
And she accepted.
That's the whole story

38:05.583 --> 38:06.607
Why don't you go to Canada?

38:07.051 --> 38:08.416
I didn't say I won't go

38:13.257 --> 38:16.158
"Since 9 am this morning
people started approaching"

38:16.494 --> 38:19.895
"Tiananmen Square
from every direction"

38:20.164 --> 38:21.324
(70th Anniversary of May 4th)

38:21.565 --> 38:22.759
"The parade is filled with happiness. "

38:22.933 --> 38:24.958
"As if everyone found
a common language... "

38:25.269 --> 38:26.293
"... and a common belief"

38:26.504 --> 38:28.995
"The crowd is soaking up
the atmosphere. "

39:01.238 --> 39:03.172
I don't want to work like this anymore

39:03.674 --> 39:04.936
Please stay a little longer

39:08.012 --> 39:09.411
How do you pay the money back?

39:10.114 --> 39:11.342
This is not my business

39:11.515 --> 39:12.948
I am a singer only, not a clown

39:13.117 --> 39:15.415
Are you naive or what? It's your job

39:24.395 --> 39:25.419
Please

39:25.629 --> 39:26.061
Fuck off

41:18.108 --> 41:21.441
Li Bai was more sensitive and romantic

41:21.679 --> 41:23.237
He liked drinking

41:23.414 --> 41:27.043
Du Fu's poems were more patriotic

41:27.251 --> 41:28.616
...and socially oriented

41:54.411 --> 41:55.343
Mrs. Lam

41:56.080 --> 41:57.672
Sorry! Samantha and Muriel

41:57.915 --> 42:00.349
I'm sorry, Miss Wu

42:00.651 --> 42:02.482
I didn't know they were not at school

42:03.487 --> 42:07.947
Muriel's parents came to
scold us this morning

42:08.993 --> 42:12.724
Muriel was beaten by her father
and was bleeding

42:12.963 --> 42:15.158
So I let her stay at my place

42:15.432 --> 42:19.027
I told them to go to school everyday
I did

42:22.606 --> 42:24.506
This is Samantha
I can't take your call right now

42:24.708 --> 42:25.800
Please leave a message

42:28.212 --> 42:30.339
Do you hear the people sing?

42:30.548 --> 42:32.607
Singing the song of angry men?

42:32.850 --> 42:34.943
It is the music of a people

42:35.152 --> 42:37.416
who will not be slaves again!

42:37.655 --> 42:39.623
When the beating of your heart

42:39.857 --> 42:41.916
echoes the beating of the drums

42:42.192 --> 42:46.595
There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!

42:46.964 --> 42:48.955
Will you join in our crusade?

42:49.166 --> 42:51.361
Who will be strong and stand with me?

42:51.569 --> 42:55.630
Beyond the barricade is there
a world you long to see?

42:56.740 --> 42:58.605
We all have our rights

42:58.809 --> 43:02.438
If people lose their human rights

43:02.646 --> 43:04.136
then what is the point of being human?

43:24.501 --> 43:26.935
Hello? Mom?

43:29.673 --> 43:31.971
Don't cry! Tell me what happened

43:39.583 --> 43:40.982
It's fine

44:06.176 --> 44:07.040
Have you found them?

44:09.046 --> 44:10.035
Not yet

44:11.782 --> 44:16.651
If there's no news of them by tomorrow
we'll have to call the police

44:39.309 --> 44:40.241
Flavia

44:40.611 --> 44:41.578
What?

44:48.919 --> 44:51.979
Where have you been?
Why didn't you go to school?

44:52.156 --> 44:54.886
You got your parents very worried

45:02.499 --> 45:03.397
Are you alright?

45:04.368 --> 45:06.199
Miss Wu, you must help us

45:06.570 --> 45:08.765
I don't want to be separated from Muriel

45:11.508 --> 45:12.941
Come over first

45:17.214 --> 45:20.308
Go back home, it'll be alright

45:23.887 --> 45:25.514
They scolded us

45:26.256 --> 45:27.951
A lot of people are like us actually

45:28.092 --> 45:29.525
What can I do?

45:29.960 --> 45:31.825
My Dad wants me
to go back to Canada

45:32.029 --> 45:33.758
Please help us

45:34.832 --> 45:39.531
We can't go home. My dad'll kill me

45:40.504 --> 45:44.235
Money! Can you lend us
money to run away?

45:44.441 --> 45:47.968
I'll pay you back when
I can earn some money

45:50.581 --> 45:54.915
Stay here tonight

45:55.119 --> 45:57.280
I'll take you home tomorrow

45:57.688 --> 45:59.588
There're a lot of things you can't rush

45:59.890 --> 46:02.552
You'll only hurt yourself
if you're too impatient

46:15.439 --> 46:17.669
You shouldn't do this

46:18.609 --> 46:23.808
The students are becoming les...
and running away from home

46:24.081 --> 46:26.174
Instead of calling their parents

46:26.383 --> 46:27.941
you let them stay at your place

46:29.686 --> 46:33.178
They're kids but you're a grown up

46:37.327 --> 46:39.625
You don't know what it feels
like to be separated

46:47.204 --> 46:50.662
This song is called "Never"
It was written 9 years ago

46:50.874 --> 46:52.398
The song says he never went anywhere

46:52.609 --> 46:55.237
He could only afford meals at 8 dollars
But he was happy

46:57.981 --> 46:59.642
Have you heard this before? No

46:59.883 --> 47:01.942
Never been to U. S...

47:02.653 --> 47:05.281
Never been to England

47:06.156 --> 47:08.852
Never been to Japan

47:09.660 --> 47:12.322
Never been to Russia

47:13.263 --> 47:18.633
I've never been to
never been to C-H-I-N-A!

47:20.504 --> 47:23.337
Never own a mobile

47:23.707 --> 47:26.335
Never own a house

47:27.144 --> 47:30.671
Never own much anything

47:30.948 --> 47:33.382
Never travel far

47:34.184 --> 47:38.985
I never fly, I never fly in the a-i-r!

47:59.409 --> 48:01.639
They've been here last night

48:05.349 --> 48:08.807
Shall I drive you to see
Muriel's parents?

48:09.219 --> 48:11.983
It's alright. I think they'll be fine

48:13.457 --> 48:15.448
I

48:15.659 --> 48:19.220
Please hold, just a second

48:21.999 --> 48:23.023
Hello?

48:24.268 --> 48:25.132
Samantha?

48:29.406 --> 48:31.499
"Ladies and Gentlemen... "

48:31.742 --> 48:35.735
"we'll soon be arriving at New Macau
Marinetime Ferry Terminal"

48:35.979 --> 48:37.844
"For your own safety... "

48:38.081 --> 48:42.814
"please remain seated until
the vassal is properly berthed"

49:25.028 --> 49:26.655
Hello? Yes, Mrs. Lam

49:26.830 --> 49:29.492
I'm in Macau now

49:31.068 --> 49:33.002
Oh... they went home already?

49:33.870 --> 49:36.395
It's ok. Bye

50:02.566 --> 50:03.897
Hey, here

50:12.843 --> 50:15.175
Fabulous

50:26.757 --> 50:27.781
What are you thinking?

50:28.892 --> 50:29.859
A lot

50:31.595 --> 50:32.857
Like what?

50:36.099 --> 50:39.660
Sometimes I feel that I am not myself

50:42.973 --> 50:44.873
As if there's a mismatch

50:51.281 --> 50:52.873
I think I've seen this image before

50:57.854 --> 51:00.414
Actually everything
has happened before

51:00.624 --> 51:01.989
It has all been scripted

51:02.993 --> 51:04.051
Scripted?

51:07.464 --> 51:10.695
Some people believe
they can change their lives

51:11.468 --> 51:13.493
And they try their best to do it

51:13.737 --> 51:17.070
But no matter what, their lives
have already been scripted

51:17.274 --> 51:19.367
Their choices and the results
are all pre-destined

51:19.543 --> 51:24.480
You should say they're
all pre-meditative

51:25.248 --> 51:27.216
Pre-meditative... right

52:08.458 --> 52:10.892
Yeah, you lose. Punishment

52:40.657 --> 52:44.115
Hi! Are you from Hong Kong?

52:44.361 --> 52:45.328
Yes

52:46.396 --> 52:47.454
My name is Carl

52:49.399 --> 52:50.366
What's yours?

54:11.181 --> 54:12.910
Do you really love me?

54:13.350 --> 54:14.783
One hundred percent

54:15.352 --> 54:16.580
How can you prove it?

54:16.853 --> 54:18.377
Now is the proof

54:19.389 --> 54:20.583
How long will you love me?

54:23.760 --> 54:25.227
What does that mean?

54:25.629 --> 54:27.426
Isn't it scripted already?

54:27.764 --> 54:29.994
Yes. But we don't know
what's in the script

54:30.634 --> 54:32.465
Right! How smart we are!

54:32.669 --> 54:34.364
At least we know it's all a conspiracy

54:34.571 --> 54:36.732
Pre-meditative! Conspiracy?

54:49.386 --> 54:51.320
In fact I'm not interested in politics

54:52.522 --> 54:55.787
But politics is something
we must deal with

54:56.326 --> 54:59.193
As a human being, I cannot ignore it

55:00.263 --> 55:01.787
I'm talking about resistance

55:02.198 --> 55:04.189
Resisting the confines
our society gave us

55:05.302 --> 55:07.702
You can only do this. You cannot do that

55:08.571 --> 55:10.436
You must go through life

55:10.674 --> 55:11.868
...under these circumstances

55:12.542 --> 55:14.737
There's too much prejudice here

55:15.545 --> 55:18.173
We're only asking for the life
we want to lead

55:19.416 --> 55:21.509
Without being invaded

55:21.951 --> 55:23.612
Without being manipulated

55:30.927 --> 55:32.019
Sorry

55:45.442 --> 55:49.378
Mom... how are you feeling?

55:51.047 --> 55:52.105
Dizzy?

55:54.017 --> 55:56.008
I'm at the studying room

56:22.379 --> 56:23.437
Just now

56:23.680 --> 56:25.045
Remember to turn off
the pager next time

56:32.088 --> 56:33.817
I'm going to my mother's place

56:34.290 --> 56:37.282
Can you help me send the film
to the shop?

57:38.888 --> 57:39.752
Miss Wu

57:41.090 --> 57:45.117
Sorry, I've given you a lot of trouble

57:45.361 --> 57:47.090
Silly girl

57:48.064 --> 57:49.156
I'll go in first

58:18.862 --> 58:20.386
"Heaven-Cleansed Sands"

58:21.698 --> 58:24.223
Orioles and swallows
announce the spring

58:24.801 --> 58:27.463
Flowers and willows reveal the truth

58:28.238 --> 58:30.763
All things have style and rhythm

58:31.274 --> 58:33.037
Shy and delicate;

58:33.476 --> 58:35.967
that's prim and proper people

58:39.148 --> 58:43.107
Flowers and willows reveal... Jin

58:45.688 --> 58:47.212
"Raising my cup I ask the bright moon"

58:47.390 --> 58:48.880
"Bring me my shadow
and make us three"

58:49.192 --> 58:51.524
In Li Bai's
"Drinking Alone With the Moon"

58:51.728 --> 58:54.492
"Bring me my shadow
and make us three" means

58:54.697 --> 58:56.892
Li Bai, Li Bai's shadow and the moon

58:57.133 --> 58:59.624
No! Samantha! No

59:01.638 --> 59:03.265
Leave me alone!

59:03.506 --> 59:06.031
Samantha! Calm down

59:06.242 --> 59:08.005
Monitor! Go and call an ambulance

59:15.285 --> 59:17.253
How're the students?

59:17.453 --> 59:20.251
2803... 1234

59:21.257 --> 59:22.417
Any calls from Flavia?

59:22.892 --> 59:24.086
"... made the strongest
speech in years... "

59:24.260 --> 59:26.785
"... directed to the unrest
of recent weeks"

59:27.063 --> 59:29.531
Come and look!
They're forcing them to leave!

59:35.338 --> 59:39.069
"After the army took control"

59:39.309 --> 59:41.800
"the people and the students
used vehicles"

59:42.011 --> 59:43.808
"to block the path of the army

59:44.047 --> 59:45.639
"... at major entrances to the city"

59:45.815 --> 59:47.510
"Some people simply sat on the road"

59:47.717 --> 59:49.412
"and used their own bodies... "

59:49.652 --> 59:50.880
"to stop the army vehicles from moving"

59:56.993 --> 59:58.051
"The troops made way"

59:58.294 --> 59:59.955
"to Tiananmen Square"

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.256
"in military vehicles and tanks... "

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.228
"... from last night to this morning"

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:08.461
"People gathered and stopped
the army from moving"

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.985
"The army did not retreat this time"

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.833
"At 4 am... "

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:47.804
Pre-meditative

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.003
"the troops are arriving
at Tiananmen Square"

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.311
"A lot of gun shots were heard"

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:11.156
"Many people were injured
Some of them were killed"

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.331
"Only flare bombs were flashing
People were forced... "

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.667
"... to leave under heavy arms"

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:07.089
Miss Wu

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.390
Muriel was sent to live with her sister

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.519
in Vancouver yesterday

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.702
It was Muriel's father

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:26.542
who dragged them back from Macau

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:53.298
Muriel

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:08.873
Samantha

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:14.615
Miss, why didn't you help us?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.257
Why didn't you lend us money to leave?

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:31.497
We thank you a lot! Please go!
