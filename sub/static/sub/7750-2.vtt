00:00.150 --> 00:01.851
Previously on "Devious Maids"...

00:02.593 --> 00:04.349
We have to go to the police.

00:04.350 --> 00:06.263
They need to know the truth
about Flora.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.250
Why?
They already arrested someone.

00:08.251 --> 00:09.700
Maybe he didn't do it.

00:09.701 --> 00:11.405
I wanna get out of here, mom.

00:11.406 --> 00:13.037
I'm working on it, baby.

00:13.038 --> 00:15.991
We're hoping to find someone
to live in.

00:15.992 --> 00:17.872
That's the situation
that I'm looking for.

00:17.873 --> 00:19.231
What about the girl who got killed?

00:19.232 --> 00:22.595
Those people she worked for,
they're... strange.

00:22.596 --> 00:25.944
Are you ambitious, Marisol?

00:26.539 --> 00:28.707
I found a lawyer for immigration.

00:28.708 --> 00:31.043
He said that he can help me
bring Miguel to America.

00:31.044 --> 00:34.012
Who's Miguel?
That's her kid back in Guadalajara.

00:34.013 --> 00:35.680
I like waiting on you.

00:35.681 --> 00:39.518
Rich boys? They never fall
in love with the help.

00:39.519 --> 00:41.019
Do you have a crush on me?

00:41.020 --> 00:42.687
I'm not admittin' nothing.

00:42.688 --> 00:45.490
This is Bonita's replacement?
Her name is Carmen.

00:45.491 --> 00:46.792
The only reason I took this job

00:46.793 --> 00:48.727
was so I could become friends
with Alejandro.

00:48.728 --> 00:51.029
If you play him your music,
I will fire you.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.999
What is this?
It's nothing.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.101
Carmen!

00:56.102 --> 00:57.537
Aah!

00:58.671 --> 01:01.541
Odessa! Are you okay?

01:07.502 --> 01:09.368
So when does Odessa get back
from the hospital?

01:09.369 --> 01:10.515
It should be about a week.

01:10.516 --> 01:11.983
But you don't gotta worry
about a thing.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.253
Carmen and I are gonna take
great care of this place.

01:16.255 --> 01:17.890
See that you do.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.898
So what do we do first?

01:27.590 --> 01:30.145
I say lets get crazy
and wax the floors.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.573
Carmen?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.698
It's not right.

01:36.699 --> 01:38.000
What's not?

01:38.001 --> 01:39.512
Alejandro's never here.

01:39.513 --> 01:41.607
Between his other houses
and all his touring,

01:41.608 --> 01:44.515
he's in this house, what,
ten weeks a year?

01:44.516 --> 01:46.451
If that.

01:46.452 --> 01:49.454
Most of the time,
this amazing place is empty.

01:49.455 --> 01:52.757
Nobody sits on the silk sofa.
Nobody plays the grand piano.

01:52.758 --> 01:54.604
So what?
So it's immoral.

01:54.605 --> 01:57.763
If God blesses you with nice things,
He expects you to use them.

01:57.764 --> 01:59.030
Carmen!

02:02.001 --> 02:04.135
We have to enjoy
what God has given us.

02:04.136 --> 02:05.436
This is our way to thank Him.

02:05.437 --> 02:07.138
Uh, what are you doing?

02:07.139 --> 02:09.273
Well, if Alejandro won't thank God
for His many blessings,

02:09.274 --> 02:11.377
I think someone
should do it for him.

02:13.178 --> 02:16.381
What about the waxing?

02:16.382 --> 02:17.982
Yeah, we'll get to it...

02:17.983 --> 02:20.018
after I spend 20 minutes
in this pool...

02:20.019 --> 02:21.487
thanking God.

02:25.124 --> 02:26.724
What's wrong?

02:26.725 --> 02:29.227
Nothing.

02:29.228 --> 02:31.699
I just didn't know you were this...

02:32.965 --> 02:34.699
Religious?

03:15.741 --> 03:17.308
It's the police.

03:17.309 --> 03:20.078
They say they need to talk
to you about your son.

03:20.079 --> 03:22.246
I'm sorry to tell you this.

03:22.247 --> 03:26.247
A girl was stabbed,
and Eddie had the knife.

03:26.985 --> 03:28.753
The police investigation is over.

03:28.754 --> 03:31.290
They're convinced
your son is guilty.

03:35.394 --> 03:37.662
Marisol.

03:37.663 --> 03:38.463
Hey, guys.

03:38.464 --> 03:39.764
Hi.

03:39.765 --> 03:41.666
Have you seen this?

03:41.667 --> 03:43.434
There's something in
here about your friend.

03:43.435 --> 03:45.403
The one who was murdered.

03:45.404 --> 03:46.738
They wrote about Flora?

03:46.739 --> 03:49.707
And the boy who was arrested.

03:49.708 --> 03:54.245
"Suspect in Maid Murder
maintains his innocence."

03:54.246 --> 03:55.346
Well, what else is he gonna say?

03:55.347 --> 03:58.049
Who knows?
Maybe he didn't do it.

03:58.050 --> 03:59.984
They caught him with the knife.

03:59.985 --> 04:01.686
He was hit on the head,
and when he came to,

04:01.687 --> 04:03.287
the knife was in his hand.

04:03.288 --> 04:05.389
This kid is being framed.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.692
According to the article.

04:07.693 --> 04:09.994
Well, I guess anything's possible.

04:09.995 --> 04:12.563
Especially in that house.

04:12.564 --> 04:14.398
Hey, anyone want grapes?
Mnh-Mnh.

04:14.399 --> 04:15.767
Mnh-Mnh.

04:15.768 --> 04:19.771
So... Did Flora ever
talk about the Powells?

04:19.772 --> 04:21.339
Why would you ask that?

04:21.339 --> 04:24.374
I was in their house last Friday.

04:24.375 --> 04:27.177
I cleaned the room
that she was murdered in.

04:30.381 --> 04:31.948
What was it like?

04:31.949 --> 04:33.449
Ugh. There was blood everywhere.

04:33.450 --> 04:35.752
It was awful.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.987
Flora did talk about the Powells,

04:37.988 --> 04:40.823
and she had nothing good
to say about them.

04:40.824 --> 04:42.125
Can we not talk about those people?

04:42.126 --> 04:45.762
It's a nice day.
Let's just enjoy the grapes.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.864
Well, Taylor has a luncheon today.

04:47.865 --> 04:50.099
So I better get to the store.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.502
Marisol. Do me a favor.

04:52.503 --> 04:54.437
Stay away from the Powells.

04:54.438 --> 04:56.406
Why?

04:56.407 --> 04:58.107
Well, if that boy was framed,

04:58.108 --> 05:00.843
I'm willing to bet they had
something to do with it.

05:00.844 --> 05:03.314
Good to know.

05:06.617 --> 05:08.552
Page 43.

05:08.553 --> 05:10.020
What?

05:10.021 --> 05:13.024
If Flora was white,
she would have been on page one.

05:19.464 --> 05:21.631
You going to the movies tonight?

05:21.632 --> 05:23.533
A bunch of us are going to see
"White Heat" at the Music Hall.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.535
I'm trying to get Glen here
to go with us.

05:25.536 --> 05:27.404
Dude, it's in black and white.

05:27.405 --> 05:28.939
Yeah, but it's not boring.
I swear.

05:28.940 --> 05:32.342
James Cagney plays this psychopath
who goes around killing all these people.

05:32.343 --> 05:33.944
If he killed 'em in color,
I'd consider it.

05:35.546 --> 05:38.482
Why are boys always
so obsessed with violence?

05:38.483 --> 05:41.885
Aren't there any young men who like films
about romance and heartbreak?

05:41.886 --> 05:43.587
Yes.

05:43.588 --> 05:46.790
And they see those films
while dating other young men.

05:46.791 --> 05:48.558
Now that you mention it,

05:48.559 --> 05:50.995
I always thought you were gay.

05:53.264 --> 05:56.500
Yeah. She says things like that.

05:56.501 --> 05:57.801
Mom.

05:57.802 --> 05:59.936
Do you remember
what we talked about?

05:59.937 --> 06:02.038
Oh, that's right.

06:02.039 --> 06:05.542
When your friends are here,
I'm invisible.

06:12.950 --> 06:15.519
Come on.
You gotta check it out.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.553
Sorry, dude.

06:16.554 --> 06:17.988
I just don't like old movies.

06:17.989 --> 06:20.757
I do. I like old movies.

06:20.758 --> 06:21.958
Really?

06:21.959 --> 06:23.927
Sure.
I just saw "Rear Window" last week.

06:23.928 --> 06:25.428
You're into Hitchcock?

06:25.429 --> 06:27.497
Oh, sure. I love "Rebecca"

06:27.498 --> 06:28.965
and "Strangers on a Train,"

06:28.966 --> 06:30.767
and "North by Northwest."

06:30.768 --> 06:31.968
Really?

06:31.969 --> 06:34.004
I had no idea.

06:38.009 --> 06:40.410
No, I haven't.

06:42.013 --> 06:44.881
How have you not seen "Psycho"?
I know. I know.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.883
How can I call myself a Hitchcock fan?

06:46.884 --> 06:48.485
Valentina.

06:48.486 --> 06:51.755
I need help with the groceries.

06:51.756 --> 06:53.324
Excuse me.

07:05.803 --> 07:07.804
So what was going on in there?

07:07.805 --> 07:09.973
Nothing.
We were just talking.

07:09.974 --> 07:13.743
Must have been important
for you to sit down at the table.

07:13.744 --> 07:15.245
It wasn't important.

07:15.246 --> 07:17.781
We were just laughing
about something.

07:17.782 --> 07:20.684
Mr. Remi can laugh with his friend.
You're here to work.

07:20.685 --> 07:21.785
Mami.

07:21.786 --> 07:23.453
He is your employer,
not your friend.

07:23.454 --> 07:26.790
If you cannot remember that,
I will take you out of this house.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.759
Do you understand?

07:38.502 --> 07:40.804
Rosie!

07:40.805 --> 07:42.939
Spence, stop.
You're just embarrassing yourself.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.441
Is something wrong?

07:44.442 --> 07:45.909
Maybe.
Is this my underwear?

07:45.910 --> 07:47.477
What?

07:47.478 --> 07:48.812
I found 'em under our bed,
and it's not my brand.

07:48.813 --> 07:49.980
I bought them for you a year ago.

07:49.981 --> 07:51.414
Well, I've never seen them before.

07:51.415 --> 07:52.916
I'm strictly Calvin Klein,
and this is...

07:52.917 --> 07:55.418
this is some Italian name
I can't even pronounce.

07:55.419 --> 07:58.921
Okay, okay, you are so paranoid,
I can't even deal with you right now.

07:58.922 --> 08:00.423
Tell him you've seen these,
like, a million times.

08:00.424 --> 08:02.391
Stop coaching her.
Stop yelling. You're scaring her.

08:02.392 --> 08:04.293
I am not.
She's terrified.

08:04.294 --> 08:06.295
Tell him you're terrified.
Stop telling her what to say!

08:09.299 --> 08:11.134
I'm sorry, Rosie.

08:11.135 --> 08:13.136
I'm upset
because I'm worried another man

08:13.137 --> 08:15.905
has left his underwear
in my bedroom.

08:15.906 --> 08:18.775
But I trust you to tell me
the truth.

08:18.776 --> 08:21.845
So for the last time,
do you recognize these?

08:26.884 --> 08:29.385
I think so.

08:29.386 --> 08:31.288
You think?

08:34.892 --> 08:36.359
Yes, I've seen them.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.162
Mm-hmm.

08:39.962 --> 08:42.198
Oh.

08:42.198 --> 08:43.866
Well, my mistake.

08:43.866 --> 08:45.434
No harm, no foul.

08:45.435 --> 08:48.872
Now you've gotta get dressed
if you're gonna make your call time.

09:14.298 --> 09:16.249
Hello, Mrs. Powell.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.151
Marisol, how are you doing?

09:18.152 --> 09:20.253
Good. How about you?

09:20.254 --> 09:22.188
Have you had any luck
finding a housekeeper?

09:22.189 --> 09:23.289
No.

09:23.290 --> 09:26.259
The agency sent over this one woman.
She was stone-cold deaf.

09:26.260 --> 09:29.195
I need someone who can react
when I'm screaming at them.

09:29.196 --> 09:31.664
Shrimp puffs.

09:34.134 --> 09:37.737
You know, I could come
and help you if you like.

09:37.738 --> 09:39.672
That's sweet, but aren't
you here full-time?

09:39.673 --> 09:41.474
I could come on my day off.

09:41.475 --> 09:42.675
Your day off?

09:42.676 --> 09:44.644
Why are you so eager
to work for Adrian and me?

09:44.645 --> 09:46.579
You seem like nice people.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.281
No, we don't.

09:48.282 --> 09:49.616
And I need the money.

09:49.617 --> 09:52.785
That I understand.

09:52.786 --> 09:55.455
So... what do you say?

09:55.456 --> 09:58.558
I say your hearing is good,
and I'm desperate.

09:58.559 --> 10:00.293
Let's do it.
Great.

10:00.294 --> 10:02.762
Just make sure you get
Taylor's permission first.

10:02.763 --> 10:05.665
Taylor has no say over
what I do on my day off.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.767
Marisol, we have a saying
here in Beverly Hills.

10:07.768 --> 10:10.169
To steal another woman's husband
is rude,

10:10.170 --> 10:13.539
but to steal her maid
is unforgivable.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.774
Fine. I'll ask her.

10:14.775 --> 10:17.278
But I'm sure
it won't be a problem.

10:18.679 --> 10:20.580
Absolutely not.

10:20.581 --> 10:22.148
What?

10:22.149 --> 10:23.249
You heard me.
I don't want you working there.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.817
May I ask why not?

10:24.818 --> 10:26.819
Because you should be resting
on your day off

10:26.820 --> 10:28.588
so you're fresh
for when I need you.

10:28.589 --> 10:29.822
This will not affect my work.

10:29.823 --> 10:32.292
I don't care.
It just makes me uncomfortable.

10:32.293 --> 10:33.826
But why?
It would be a few hours a week,

10:33.827 --> 10:35.663
and I'd be helping out
your friend.

10:38.165 --> 10:40.700
Evelyn Powell comes to my home
several times a month.

10:40.701 --> 10:43.469
I feed her.
I smile at her jokes.

10:43.470 --> 10:47.574
But make no mistake.
She is not a friend of mine.

10:55.184 --> 10:57.251
No need to apologize.

10:57.252 --> 10:59.287
I had a feeling
she might feel that way.

10:59.288 --> 11:01.923
All right.
Well, you take care. Bye.

11:02.991 --> 11:04.926
Who was that?

11:04.927 --> 11:08.995
Marisol offered to work for us
one day a week.

11:08.996 --> 11:11.131
Taylor said no.

11:11.132 --> 11:12.999
Marisol offered?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.001
Well, her manner was casual,
but I could tell

11:15.002 --> 11:17.637
it was something
she very much wanted.

11:17.638 --> 11:20.107
Really?

11:22.043 --> 11:25.645
You're wearing your smug smile.

11:25.646 --> 11:28.315
The one that makes me
want to strike you.

11:28.316 --> 11:31.051
The day Marisol worked here,
we spoke.

11:31.052 --> 11:33.653
It was only for a few moments,
but...

11:33.654 --> 11:36.156
I could tell she was interested.

11:36.157 --> 11:39.659
For the last time, darling,
when a woman's skin crawls,

11:39.660 --> 11:42.662
it doesn't mean
she's attracted to you.

11:42.663 --> 11:44.231
So Taylor said no, huh?

11:44.232 --> 11:47.000
Well, you know how she feels
about us.

11:47.001 --> 11:49.433
Still, I shall have to have a talk
with her.

11:51.639 --> 11:55.041
You know, we could always
find another maid.

11:55.042 --> 11:57.077
No.

11:57.078 --> 11:59.714
I want Marisol.

12:19.669 --> 12:20.749
Valentina?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.751
Oh. Hi, Remi.

12:22.752 --> 12:23.852
What are you doing here?

12:23.853 --> 12:25.286
I told you I liked old movies.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.856
I decided I had to check Cagney out.

12:27.857 --> 12:29.824
Hi.

12:29.825 --> 12:30.859
Hi.
Oh, sorry.

12:30.860 --> 12:31.926
Guys, this is Valentina.

12:31.927 --> 12:34.396
This is Alyssa, Dan, Stacey...

12:34.397 --> 12:36.164
Hi.
Alli, Kelly, and James.

12:36.165 --> 12:37.399
Hey.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.802
So are you by yourself?
I called my friend, but she flaked.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.337
You want to sit with us?

12:42.338 --> 12:43.805
Yeah.
Oh.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.808
I guess I could.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.376
Cute dress.
Where'd you get it?

12:48.377 --> 12:50.745
I made it.
Shut up.

12:50.746 --> 12:51.980
Yeah. I'm gonna be a designer.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.815
By the way, I love your shoes.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.483
Are they Marc Jacobs?

12:55.484 --> 12:57.819
Good eye.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.487
We like the new girl.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.890
So do I.

13:01.891 --> 13:05.227
Ah, here we go.
Come on, guys.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.870
I don't like to lie.

13:16.305 --> 13:18.272
Those underwears...

13:18.273 --> 13:20.375
They do not belong to Mr. Spence.

13:22.711 --> 13:24.245
Of course they don't.

13:24.246 --> 13:25.713
I've been wanting to explain.

13:25.714 --> 13:28.983
It's... actually a really funny story.

13:28.984 --> 13:31.819
I like to laugh.

13:31.820 --> 13:36.290
So while you were in San Diego
seeing that immigration lawyer,

13:36.291 --> 13:38.326
this actor in my movie
came over to rehearse.

13:38.327 --> 13:40.328
And it was really hot that day,

13:40.329 --> 13:41.996
so we decided to run lines
in the pool.

13:41.997 --> 13:44.031
And when he left, he must
have asked a million times,

13:44.032 --> 13:45.600
"Do I have everything?"

13:45.601 --> 13:47.868
but he clearly didn't
because he, you know...

13:47.869 --> 13:50.938
he left his underwear behind.

13:54.643 --> 13:57.378
Rosie, I know what you must
be thinking,

13:57.379 --> 14:00.414
but... I've told you the truth.

14:00.415 --> 14:02.984
Then why not tell Mr. Spence?

14:02.985 --> 14:04.852
Because he's insecure.

14:04.853 --> 14:06.822
And he would assume the worst.

14:08.924 --> 14:11.359
For God sake, Rosie.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.761
He's my husband.

14:13.762 --> 14:14.929
Just because we fight,

14:14.930 --> 14:17.765
it doesn't mean
we don't love each other.

14:17.766 --> 14:21.837
I would never hurt him like that.

14:23.271 --> 14:25.272
This actor...

14:25.273 --> 14:28.275
You swear you didn't...

14:28.276 --> 14:30.245
You know?

14:32.381 --> 14:35.684
I swear on the life of my child.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.988
Okay.

14:40.989 --> 14:44.292
I won't say nothing
to Mr. Spence.

14:47.729 --> 14:48.830
Thank you.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.648
I should have been born rich.

15:07.649 --> 15:09.517
We're right there with you, mija.

15:09.518 --> 15:10.985
No, no, no.
It's different for me.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.953
You guys know how
to pull off poverty.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.622
I don't.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.756
Was that a compliment?

15:15.757 --> 15:17.625
Who cares?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.760
I'm on a beach
with Enrique Iglesias.

15:19.761 --> 15:20.861
Mm.

15:20.862 --> 15:22.730
See, ever since I was a kid,

15:22.731 --> 15:24.799
I knew I was meant
to own nice things,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.333
not clean them.

15:26.334 --> 15:27.935
I don't think
you ever cleaned this.

15:27.936 --> 15:29.537
It's disgusting.

15:29.538 --> 15:31.605
Rosie, for the next hour,
we're on vacation.

15:31.606 --> 15:33.474
You ain't gotta keep thinking
like a maid.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.710
I was thinking like someone
who wants to put her drink down.

15:35.711 --> 15:38.979
Carmen, if you like money so much,
why don't you do

15:38.980 --> 15:40.281
what the rest of Beverly Hills
does?

15:40.282 --> 15:41.816
Marry a rich guy.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.285
Because then it's his money,
and he has the power.

15:44.286 --> 15:46.320
And that is unacceptable.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.956
Okay, ladies.
It's time to be quiet.

15:48.957 --> 15:51.892
Mm.
Let's just savor the moment.

15:51.893 --> 15:53.027
Carmen!

15:53.028 --> 15:55.663
Son of a bitch!

15:55.664 --> 15:57.865
Okay.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.333
Stay here.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.269
I'll be back.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.840
I mean,
how can she not wipe this down?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.641
It's all gross.

16:07.642 --> 16:08.743
I'm trying to pass out here.

16:08.744 --> 16:10.811
Either grab a rag or shut up.

16:15.216 --> 16:16.383
What is going on here?

16:16.384 --> 16:18.118
I'm allowed to take a lunch break.

16:18.119 --> 16:20.387
Inside, by yourself.
Who are those people?

16:20.388 --> 16:21.755
My friends.

16:21.756 --> 16:23.357
Well, I-I want them out of here.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.491
Ten more minutes.
No.

16:24.492 --> 16:26.293
Please.
No.

16:26.294 --> 16:27.494
Why are you being so mean?

16:27.495 --> 16:29.496
We're not allowed
to have guests here.

16:29.497 --> 16:32.133
Why should I risk my job
so that you can play hostess?

16:38.539 --> 16:41.275
Okay, ten more minutes.

16:41.276 --> 16:45.480
Oh, baby, after that kiss,
I deserve at least 15.

16:53.921 --> 16:55.889
Say it for me.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.457
What?

16:57.458 --> 16:58.892
Come on.
You know what I want to hear.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.727
Oh.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.862
Um...

17:02.863 --> 17:05.732
Top of the world, ma.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.635
That kills me.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.435
Hey, next week we're going
see "Double Indemnity."

17:10.436 --> 17:11.604
You in?

17:11.605 --> 17:13.440
I'll have to check.

17:14.842 --> 17:17.977
"Top of the world, ma"?

17:17.978 --> 17:20.579
Yeah, I went to the movies
last night

17:20.580 --> 17:21.915
and I ran into Remi.

17:23.218 --> 17:25.484
Like the hook ran into the fish.

17:25.486 --> 17:27.521
It was no big deal.

17:27.521 --> 17:29.356
I told you to stay away from him.

17:29.357 --> 17:31.024
At work.

17:31.025 --> 17:34.094
But when I'm outside of this house,
I can hang out with whoever I want.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.396
He is your employer.
You are his maid.

17:36.397 --> 17:38.098
Either way, he likes me.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.434
Yeah.
He said that to his friends.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.135
And they like me, too.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.304
Do they know
you scrub his toilet?

17:44.305 --> 17:47.140
Every mother
wants the best for her child.

17:47.141 --> 17:48.342
Why don't you?

17:48.343 --> 17:50.477
You and I have different ideas
about what's best.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.179
Remi is what's best for me.

17:52.180 --> 17:56.017
And I'm gonna be a part of his life
whether you like it or not.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.363
Isn't it nice to have Remi back?

18:09.364 --> 18:11.398
Oh, it is.

18:11.399 --> 18:15.969
I don't think I knew
how much I missed him.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.404
I sure hope he stays for a while.

18:17.405 --> 18:21.141
I can only imagine
how bored he must be.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.209
Bored?

18:22.210 --> 18:23.844
He's been living in a frat house.

18:23.845 --> 18:25.345
You know what those places
are like...

18:25.346 --> 18:27.047
Pledge parties and keggers,

18:27.048 --> 18:30.217
pretty girls constantly passing by.

18:30.218 --> 18:33.254
It's only natural for Remi
to miss that kind of excitement.

18:36.224 --> 18:37.391
I know!

18:37.392 --> 18:39.393
We'll have a party here.

18:39.394 --> 18:41.161
Here?

18:41.162 --> 18:42.362
Sure.

18:42.363 --> 18:45.232
I can throw a better party
than some silly little fraternity.

18:45.233 --> 18:48.201
And Remi can invite
as many friends as he wants.

18:48.202 --> 18:50.971
And you don't have
to worry about the catering.

18:50.972 --> 18:53.941
Valentina and I can take
care of everything.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.381
What are you still doing here?

19:01.382 --> 19:03.350
I couldn't find my car keys.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.218
Well, you've gotta get to the store.

19:05.219 --> 19:06.953
We're completely out of coffee.

19:06.954 --> 19:09.256
It's on the list.
Hey, say good-bye to mama.

19:09.257 --> 19:12.059
Yeah, he's adorable.
Just go.

19:31.345 --> 19:32.913
Oh!

19:32.914 --> 19:34.047
You know how hot you are?

19:34.048 --> 19:36.184
I do, but tell me anyway.
Mm.

20:06.047 --> 20:07.214
Aah!

20:07.215 --> 20:09.082
What the hell?
Who is that?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.217
My maid.

20:12.053 --> 20:14.087
What is she doing?

20:14.088 --> 20:17.224
Uh... Rosie?

20:17.725 --> 20:20.293
The coffee...

20:20.294 --> 20:23.697
Did you want French roast
or Colombian?

20:26.968 --> 20:29.290
Can we discuss this later?

20:37.142 --> 20:39.416
Peri Westmore's cheating
on her husband?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.085
Oh, yes. With an actor.

20:42.086 --> 20:43.253
Which one?

20:43.254 --> 20:47.124
He played a detective in that movie
where there was a murder.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.893
Oh, him.

20:49.894 --> 20:52.396
So you're not gonna tell Spence,
are you?

20:52.397 --> 20:54.998
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

20:54.999 --> 20:56.400
Because you don't know
how he'll react.

20:56.401 --> 20:58.135
He could get violent.

20:58.136 --> 20:59.336
You think?

20:59.337 --> 21:01.138
If I found out Pablo
was with another woman,

21:01.139 --> 21:02.272
I would get violent.

21:02.273 --> 21:05.242
Everything below his waist
belongs to me.

21:06.811 --> 21:08.912
It's not much, but it's mine.

21:08.913 --> 21:12.049
So is Peri in love with this guy
or is it just casual sex?

21:12.050 --> 21:13.817
What's the difference?

21:13.818 --> 21:16.286
Either way, it's a sin,
and a sin is wrong.

21:16.287 --> 21:19.990
You see, this attitude is why
we don't hang out on weekends.

21:19.991 --> 21:22.292
You should've seen Peri's
face when I came in.

21:22.293 --> 21:26.293
Huh. That cualquiera knew
it was over.

21:26.831 --> 21:29.099
Okay, you're not fond of her.
We get that.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.135
But you shouldn't tell Spence
just to get back at her.

21:32.136 --> 21:34.104
If you like him
as much as you say...

21:34.105 --> 21:36.173
I do. He's a good man.

21:36.174 --> 21:39.409
Well, then make sure that knowing the truth
is the best thing for him.

21:39.410 --> 21:41.111
Because once you tell someone

21:41.112 --> 21:44.982
that the person they love
is cheating on them,

21:44.983 --> 21:47.285
you change their life forever.

22:04.268 --> 22:06.003
...your little friends...

22:06.004 --> 22:08.005
Marisol, you're back.

22:08.006 --> 22:10.173
I hope I'm not interrupting.

22:10.174 --> 22:11.875
Not at all.

22:11.876 --> 22:13.910
In fact, we were just talking
about you.

22:13.911 --> 22:15.178
Oh?

22:15.179 --> 22:17.080
Oh, yes.

22:17.081 --> 22:19.182
Taylor has something to tell you.

22:19.183 --> 22:21.352
Don't you, sweetheart?

22:23.154 --> 22:24.955
I've, uh, changed my mind.

22:24.956 --> 22:29.059
You can work
at the Powells' house.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.161
Really?

22:31.162 --> 22:32.829
Are you sure?

22:32.830 --> 22:35.033
Oh, we had a little talk.
She's absolutely sure.

22:38.102 --> 22:41.238
Now tell me, Marisol,
when's your day off?

22:41.239 --> 22:42.539
Tomorrow.

22:42.540 --> 22:45.275
Great, but I have to warn you,
my home is...

22:45.276 --> 22:48.146
positively filthy.

22:53.017 --> 22:56.253
I'm tired.
I'm going to my room for a little while.

22:56.254 --> 22:57.287
Taylor.

22:58.990 --> 23:02.125
What did he say
to change your mind?

23:02.126 --> 23:04.028
He's just very persuasive.

23:05.496 --> 23:07.899
And cruel.

24:01.252 --> 24:03.253
I didn't know you were back.

24:03.254 --> 24:06.089
That was beautiful.

24:06.090 --> 24:09.540
Thanks.
I wrote that.

24:09.541 --> 24:10.541
You?
Yeah.

24:10.542 --> 24:11.609
Wrote that?

24:11.610 --> 24:13.544
You sound surprised.

24:15.447 --> 24:18.616
It's just so... sad.

24:18.617 --> 24:20.985
Yeah, well, I've been through
some stuff.

24:20.986 --> 24:23.688
Bad breakup?

24:23.689 --> 24:26.590
I can sing about it,
but I can't talk about it.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.593
Mm. Okay.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.495
Can I ask you something else?

24:31.496 --> 24:32.663
Sure.

24:32.664 --> 24:34.732
Why are you in a towel?

24:34.733 --> 24:36.567
Right!

24:38.370 --> 24:39.637
I just took a shower.

24:39.638 --> 24:41.472
Where?

24:41.473 --> 24:42.940
In Alejandro's bathroom.

24:42.941 --> 24:44.542
Carmen...

24:44.543 --> 24:46.344
Oh, I've had my eye
on that showerhead since day one.

24:46.345 --> 24:48.679
And it did not disappoint.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.448
I'm glad you had fun.

24:52.718 --> 24:54.685
You've been so nice to me...

24:54.686 --> 24:57.722
letting me play
while the cat's away.

24:57.723 --> 25:00.524
It's just because, you know,

25:00.525 --> 25:02.393
I like you.

25:03.428 --> 25:06.664
I'm gonna go put on my on my clothes
so I can start my work.

25:06.665 --> 25:10.401
And you like me, too, right?

25:10.402 --> 25:12.436
Not in the way you mean.

25:12.437 --> 25:14.405
Really?

25:14.406 --> 25:16.574
Because... you kissed me.

25:16.575 --> 25:18.542
You took off your clothes
in front of me.

25:18.543 --> 25:20.644
These are traditionally
female signs of encouragement.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.113
Oh, Sam, you shouldn't
take me so seriously.

25:22.114 --> 25:23.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:23.448 --> 25:25.449
So... what, are you...

25:25.450 --> 25:27.084
You just playing me?

25:27.085 --> 25:28.519
Hey, don't be rude.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.687
I'm rude?

25:29.688 --> 25:31.555
You're the one running around
in a towel

25:31.556 --> 25:32.824
flirting with me
to get out of work.

25:32.825 --> 25:34.092
Okay, calm down.

25:34.093 --> 25:35.593
Is that why your last boyfriend
dumped you?

25:35.594 --> 25:36.708
What, he got sick
of being jerked around?

25:36.709 --> 25:37.760
Sam!

25:42.167 --> 25:43.902
Oh, God. Is that...

25:43.903 --> 25:45.236
No, no, no, no.
No, she's still in the hospital.

25:45.237 --> 25:48.973
I'm back if anybody cares.

25:48.974 --> 25:50.074
Oh!

25:50.075 --> 25:51.876
Oh, my God.

25:51.877 --> 25:53.177
If she sees me like this,
I'm screwed.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.047
Please. You gotta help me.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.558
Sam?

26:07.559 --> 26:10.161
Hey, Odessa.
You're back.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.563
What are you doing
to Alejandro's piano?

26:12.564 --> 26:14.032
Just wiping off some dust.

26:14.033 --> 26:16.868
You should've called.
I would've picked you up.

26:16.869 --> 26:18.937
Oh, I couldn't wait.
The nurses were annoying.

26:18.938 --> 26:20.905
Oh. You want me to take your
bag to the room? Come on.

26:20.906 --> 26:22.607
Where is the Spanish girl?

26:22.608 --> 26:26.378
Carmen? I'm sure
she's around here somewhere.

26:35.054 --> 26:38.557
Mr. Spence, can I talk to you?

26:38.558 --> 26:40.659
Uh, sure.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.661
What's up?

26:42.662 --> 26:43.863
Well...

26:43.864 --> 26:46.291
Oh, God.
You're not gonna quit, are you?

26:46.292 --> 26:49.094
No, no.
Why would you think that?

26:49.095 --> 26:51.055
Do you know how many housekeepers
we've been through?

26:51.056 --> 26:53.132
I've heard my wife called a bitch
in five languages.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.767
Well, I will never say that.

26:54.768 --> 26:56.168
So you're happy here?

26:56.169 --> 26:58.771
'Cause I don't know what
we would do without you.

26:59.272 --> 27:02.275
Mm. You're such a nice man.

27:05.311 --> 27:07.512
Are you happy?

27:07.513 --> 27:09.047
Oh.

27:09.048 --> 27:11.116
You must be referring
to my marriage.

27:11.117 --> 27:14.486
Well, obviously, you know,
it's been difficult.

27:14.487 --> 27:15.587
You know that.

27:15.588 --> 27:18.790
You've heard us fighting.

27:18.791 --> 27:22.527
Have you ever thought
of leaving her?

27:22.528 --> 27:25.531
Sure.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.267
I can't. We have a kid.

27:29.268 --> 27:31.670
My folks were divorced,

27:31.671 --> 27:34.606
and for years, I was a rope
in a very nasty game of tug-of-war.

27:34.607 --> 27:37.609
And, no, I will not let
that happen to my son.

27:37.610 --> 27:41.112
So I gotta stick it out.

27:41.113 --> 27:43.716
Hey, what's going on there?

27:47.086 --> 27:49.487
You remind me of Ernesto.

27:49.488 --> 27:52.158
Your husband?

27:53.793 --> 27:57.629
He always said,
"El niño es lo primero."

27:57.630 --> 28:00.098
The child comes first.

28:00.599 --> 28:03.067
He was a wonderful father.

28:04.603 --> 28:06.971
Just like you.

28:06.972 --> 28:09.741
That's quite a compliment.

28:09.742 --> 28:11.243
Thank you.

28:16.315 --> 28:20.017
So is this what you came
to talk to me about?

28:20.018 --> 28:22.120
Yes.

28:22.121 --> 28:24.122
And you're sure
you're happy here?

28:24.123 --> 28:27.125
Mm.
As long as I'm working for you,

28:27.126 --> 28:29.695
I am happy.

28:43.942 --> 28:45.209
What's going on?

28:45.210 --> 28:47.578
Miss Genevieve is having a party.

28:47.579 --> 28:49.013
What kind of party?

28:49.014 --> 28:53.018
She's screening an old movie
for Remi and his friends.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.560
You know some of 'em, right?

29:04.630 --> 29:06.631
Yes.

29:09.101 --> 29:11.937
Why don't you go up and find out
what everyone wants to drink?

29:13.705 --> 29:15.673
Mami, I can't go up there.

29:15.674 --> 29:17.041
Why not?

29:17.042 --> 29:19.010
I just can't.

29:19.011 --> 29:20.978
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

29:20.979 --> 29:23.916
but this is your job.

29:39.998 --> 29:42.900
Valentina, hey.
You made it.

29:42.901 --> 29:44.068
Hey, Dan, guys.

29:44.069 --> 29:46.137
It's so good to see you.

29:46.138 --> 29:49.073
But as a member of the fashion police,
I have to read you your rights.

29:49.074 --> 29:51.042
What are you wearing?

29:53.111 --> 29:55.680
It's my uniform.

29:55.681 --> 29:57.315
Uniform?

29:57.316 --> 30:00.084
Guys, Valentina works here.

30:00.085 --> 30:02.520
She's the maid.

30:04.022 --> 30:07.291
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

30:07.292 --> 30:09.627
It's okay.

30:11.296 --> 30:13.164
Well, um...

30:13.165 --> 30:16.701
if it's not too much trouble,
could I get a beer?

30:16.702 --> 30:18.970
Sure.

30:18.971 --> 30:20.872
Anything for you guys?

30:20.873 --> 30:23.040
I'll have the same.

30:23.041 --> 30:25.610
But I want mine in a glass.

30:29.948 --> 30:31.682
Valentina.

30:31.683 --> 30:34.619
You gonna hang out with us?

30:34.620 --> 30:36.587
I can't.

30:36.588 --> 30:38.624
I'm working.

30:58.010 --> 31:01.012
You still don't understand
what I'm trying to protect you from,

31:01.013 --> 31:02.647
but one day, you will.

31:02.648 --> 31:06.851
So if you need to hate me for a while,
go right ahead.

31:06.852 --> 31:09.553
I love you so much,

31:09.554 --> 31:12.524
I can wait for you
to understand.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.955
I finished cleaning
the rest of the house.

31:43.956 --> 31:45.556
So you're ready to start
in here?

31:45.557 --> 31:47.992
Hope I'm not interrupting.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.260
Not at all.

31:49.261 --> 31:50.561
It won't take long.

31:50.562 --> 31:51.964
Please.

31:53.665 --> 31:56.300
Take your time.

31:56.301 --> 31:58.869
You're gonna stay?

31:58.870 --> 32:01.906
I love to watch women clean.

32:01.907 --> 32:04.976
I find it... soothing.

32:04.977 --> 32:07.546
That's an unusual thing
to admit.

32:08.981 --> 32:11.916
Do I intrigue you, Marisol?

32:11.917 --> 32:13.985
I'm not sure that's exactly
the word I would use.

32:13.986 --> 32:15.219
Ah.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.855
No, no, no.
Let's start with the dusting.

32:17.856 --> 32:20.058
That way we can talk.

32:34.106 --> 32:36.974
I have so many questions
I want to ask you.

32:36.975 --> 32:40.611
You probably have
some questions for me, too.

32:40.612 --> 32:43.614
Now that you mention it.

32:43.615 --> 32:46.785
I'll let you go first.

32:48.987 --> 32:52.223
Your maid, the one who died...

32:52.224 --> 32:53.991
Flora.

32:53.992 --> 32:56.293
Did you like to watch her clean?

32:56.294 --> 32:59.196
I did.

32:59.197 --> 33:01.532
Why do you want to work here?

33:01.533 --> 33:02.800
I need the money.

33:02.801 --> 33:03.868
Are you lying?

33:03.869 --> 33:05.269
Now that's another question.

33:05.270 --> 33:07.138
It's my turn.

33:07.139 --> 33:09.273
So it is.

33:12.144 --> 33:14.779
What was your relationship
to Flora?

33:16.148 --> 33:19.750
That's not so easy to answer.

33:19.751 --> 33:20.885
Flora was many things to me.

33:20.886 --> 33:23.721
She was my confidante,
my confessor,

33:23.722 --> 33:26.857
my muse...

33:26.858 --> 33:30.528
and my partner in crime.

33:30.529 --> 33:31.762
Meaning what?

33:31.763 --> 33:33.564
Ah, ah. My turn.

33:33.565 --> 33:36.301
Why are you so interested
in Flora?

33:39.738 --> 33:41.839
She was murdered in this room.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.875
Isn't it only natural
that I'd be inquisitive?

33:44.876 --> 33:47.278
I suppose.

33:47.279 --> 33:49.847
Now this is a politically
incorrect question,

33:49.848 --> 33:51.816
but I just have to ask it.

33:51.817 --> 33:53.117
Yes?

33:53.118 --> 33:55.920
What kind of maid uses the word...

33:55.921 --> 33:59.091
"inquisitive"?

34:00.892 --> 34:04.228
The kind who knows
how to read.

34:05.764 --> 34:08.132
Oh, Marisol.
I am having so much fun.

34:08.132 --> 34:09.867
I'm glad, but at this rate,

34:09.868 --> 34:12.735
it's gonna take me forever
to clean this room.

34:12.737 --> 34:15.739
We're paying you by the hour, so...
lucky you.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.876
Oh, no, no, no.

34:18.877 --> 34:20.777
Don't put that there.
They're grouped by color.

34:20.779 --> 34:22.179
Should I move this one?

34:22.179 --> 34:23.181
Please.

34:33.125 --> 34:35.873
Wait. What was that?

34:35.875 --> 34:37.141
Nothing.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.877
Mr. Powell, please.
Who wrote that?

34:38.878 --> 34:40.178
I'm sorry, Marisol!

34:40.179 --> 34:43.850
The time for questions is over.

34:59.208 --> 35:02.243
So I guess you haven't told Spence
about what happened.

35:02.244 --> 35:04.379
No.

35:04.380 --> 35:06.447
I could not hurt such a fine man.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.709
Do you hate me?

35:10.710 --> 35:12.944
Would it matter?

35:12.945 --> 35:15.380
Well...

35:15.381 --> 35:17.783
at the very least,

35:17.784 --> 35:21.320
thanks for not saying anything.

35:21.321 --> 35:24.756
I washed those sheets...

35:24.757 --> 35:27.694
But they will never be clean.

35:34.734 --> 35:35.868
Hey.

35:37.704 --> 35:39.338
I wanted to say thank you.

35:39.339 --> 35:41.773
You know, for what you did for me.

35:41.774 --> 35:43.375
No big deal.

35:43.376 --> 35:44.743
Oh, it was.

35:44.744 --> 35:47.879
If Odessa had caught me,
I would have lost my job.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.415
Well, she didn't.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.784
So...

35:54.387 --> 35:56.755
Oh, Sam.

35:56.756 --> 35:58.423
You really are a good guy,
you know?

35:58.424 --> 35:59.725
Please don't do that.

35:59.726 --> 36:01.727
Okay. Why?

36:01.728 --> 36:04.363
You know how I feel about you.

36:04.364 --> 36:06.798
Sam.

36:06.799 --> 36:08.900
So do me a favor.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.436
Don't touch me
or walk around naked,

36:11.437 --> 36:13.739
'cause...

36:13.740 --> 36:15.741
it just confuses me.

36:15.742 --> 36:19.277
It's not you.

36:19.278 --> 36:22.280
I can't be in relationship
with anybody.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.417
Why?

36:26.719 --> 36:28.287
You know that man
I wrote the song about?

36:31.791 --> 36:35.293
He didn't care about my dreams.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.296
He tried to stop me.

36:38.297 --> 36:39.766
Just so you know.

36:41.734 --> 36:44.370
I would never do that.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.776
I can't take that chance.

36:58.751 --> 37:00.886
Morning, Valentina.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.854
I wanted to thank you

37:02.855 --> 37:04.890
for all your hard work last night.

37:04.891 --> 37:07.359
Remi's friends had such a good time.

37:08.761 --> 37:11.663
Have you been crying?

37:11.664 --> 37:13.331
No.

37:15.201 --> 37:16.835
Please.

37:16.836 --> 37:19.704
I'd recognize that look anywhere.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.407
You're mourning over some man.

37:22.408 --> 37:26.212
Who is it, sweetheart?
Who's making you cry?

37:27.847 --> 37:29.415
I can't tell you.

37:31.017 --> 37:32.784
It's not Abundio, is it?

37:32.785 --> 37:34.186
Abundio?

37:34.187 --> 37:36.421
He's our landscaper,
and I've got dibs.

37:36.422 --> 37:40.860
I've been priming that pump
since the day he trimmed my hibiscus.

37:43.229 --> 37:44.463
It's Remi.

37:44.464 --> 37:47.199
Remi?

37:47.200 --> 37:48.800
You like Remi?

37:48.801 --> 37:52.801
For... as long as I can remember.

37:53.172 --> 37:56.408
Every time I see him,
it's like my face is on fire.

37:56.409 --> 37:57.809
Oh.

37:57.810 --> 38:00.679
Then it isn't just a crush?

38:00.680 --> 38:03.281
No.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.382
I love him.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.721
Well...

38:09.722 --> 38:12.157
That is a glorious thing,

38:12.158 --> 38:13.758
to be in love.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.260
I'm envious.

38:15.261 --> 38:19.431
And you're not angry?

38:19.432 --> 38:21.933
'Cause I'm just a maid.

38:21.934 --> 38:24.436
Oh, no, no, no, darling.

38:24.437 --> 38:27.172
That is what you do.

38:27.173 --> 38:30.141
That's not who you are.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.177
You are sweet and kind.

38:32.178 --> 38:35.380
And I'd be thrilled
to have my son be with you.

38:36.782 --> 38:39.284
Does Remi know how you feel?

38:39.285 --> 38:41.686
I don't think so.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.421
Well, you must tell him.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.423
But I don't know how.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.760
Mm. I understand.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.429
Well, don't worry.
I'll help you.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.265
You'd do that?

38:53.266 --> 38:57.335
The duty of the old
is to help the young find love.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.337
And since there are
no old people around,

38:59.338 --> 39:01.173
it's up to me.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.111
Mrs. Delatour, you can't
tell my mother about this.

39:06.112 --> 39:08.680
She doesn't think Remi and I
should be together.

39:08.681 --> 39:10.882
Why not?

39:10.883 --> 39:15.721
I think she's worried
Remi only sees me as the help.

39:16.756 --> 39:18.257
She should give my son
more credit.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.926
So...

39:21.927 --> 39:24.195
You won't tell her
that you're gonna help me?

39:24.196 --> 39:26.697
Oh, no.

39:26.698 --> 39:30.369
This will be our little secret.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.810
So... you and Flora,

39:38.811 --> 39:40.711
how serious were you?

39:40.712 --> 39:43.781
I told you, we just went out
on a few dates.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.650
Why?

39:45.651 --> 39:49.887
Because I found something
that might help us. A note.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.622
From Flora?

39:51.623 --> 39:54.258
I think so. I'm not sure.
It wasn't signed.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.260
Show it to me.
I can recognize her handwriting.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.796
I can't.
Adrian Powell took it from me.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.798
What'd it say?

40:00.799 --> 40:02.900
She was upset.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.571
Someone had hurt her.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.940
And I'm thinking,
if he hurt her once...

40:08.941 --> 40:11.843
Maybe that's who killed her.

40:11.844 --> 40:14.745
Mr. Powell has an alibi,
doesn't he?

40:14.746 --> 40:18.716
Yes, but I think he knows
who she was talking about.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.218
Can you get him to tell you?

40:21.720 --> 40:26.924
There's a way I could get Adrian Powell
to tell me almost anything.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.928
But I'd prefer
to get the note back.
