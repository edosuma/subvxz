00:07.808 --> 00:10.378
( grunting )

00:18.452 --> 00:20.654
Fuck me.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.856
I'm dyin' here.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.058
Let me get on
the other side,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.493
work it
from there.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.763
One, two.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.964
- Three.
- Three.

00:31.065 --> 00:34.034
( grunting )

00:42.009 --> 00:43.877
Shit.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.313
Need help?

00:50.284 --> 00:51.752
Herc:
Right, on three,
motherfuckers.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.954
One, two, three.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.491
( grunting )

01:01.895 --> 01:04.232
I'm embarrassed
for y'all.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.702
Yo, Herc,
I catch my breath,

01:08.802 --> 01:10.638
I'm gonna shoot the drawers
off this bitch.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.341
It's caught on something,
lieutenant.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.843
Get over there
with Carver.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.354 --> 01:29.290
One, two,
you know what to do.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.696
What the fuck?

01:35.796 --> 01:38.432
( grunting )

01:39.300 --> 01:40.701
( crashing sounds )

01:45.873 --> 01:47.141
Jesus.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.009
My ass is kicked.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.544
I could move it a bit
when I was alone.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.347
It must've got wedged
in the door somehow.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.883
- Desk is empty, right?
- Yeah.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.385
You checked it?

01:59.187 --> 02:02.290
Well, at this rate,
we're never gonna get it in.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.729
What?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.132
"In."

02:13.167 --> 02:14.502
In.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.806
Unbelievable.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.277
Christ.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.351
( door slams )

02:35.323 --> 02:39.327
( theme music playing )

02:41.429 --> 02:43.764
* If you walk
through the garden *

02:45.299 --> 02:47.935
* You better
watch your back *

02:49.337 --> 02:53.073
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

02:53.173 --> 02:55.509
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

02:57.177 --> 03:00.748
* If you walk
through Jesus *

03:00.848 --> 03:04.318
* He'll save your soul

03:04.418 --> 03:08.088
* You gotta
keep the devil *

03:08.188 --> 03:11.392
* Down in the hole

03:11.492 --> 03:15.162
* All the angels sing

03:15.263 --> 03:19.233
* About Jesus' mighty soul

03:19.333 --> 03:23.070
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

03:23.170 --> 03:26.574
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

03:26.674 --> 03:30.444
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

03:30.544 --> 03:34.382
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

03:34.482 --> 03:38.118
* You got to
keep the devil *

03:38.218 --> 03:41.755
* Way down in the hole

03:49.863 --> 03:52.433
* Way down in the hole

03:53.634 --> 03:55.736
* Way down in the hole

03:57.371 --> 04:01.008
* Way down in the hole

04:01.108 --> 04:03.977
* Way down in the hole.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.923
Dawkins:
This case is a bit
humble for you.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.827
Greggs:
I know it doesn't
look like much on paper,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.262
but see what you can do.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.504
Making new friends?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.306
Not yet.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.942
I spent the morning
down in juvenile court,

04:35.042 --> 04:38.145
but the kids know
they can't be hurt with
a street-weight charge,

04:38.245 --> 04:40.180
so, didn't
get much there.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.350
You tried, huh?

04:42.450 --> 04:45.453
Nothing like being told
"fuck off" by a 14-year-old.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.955
Right here's
our best shot.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.923
Him?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.459
Hand-to-hand
with Bubbles,

04:51.559 --> 04:54.428
and he's carrying
a long-ass sheet.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.465
All right, who's first,
Ms. Dawkins?

04:57.565 --> 04:59.833
State versus
Marvin Browning,
Your Honor.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.770
One count distribution
of a controlled substance,
to wit, heroin,

05:02.870 --> 05:06.340
and one count distribution
of a controlled substance,
to wit, cocaine.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.641
Quantity?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.810
One gel cap and
one vial, Your Honor.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.445
Bail recommendation?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.514
State requests
defendant be held,

05:13.614 --> 05:15.383
as he is part of
a continuing investigation

05:15.483 --> 05:17.885
and further is subject
to a mandatory five years

05:17.985 --> 05:20.220
without parole because
of prior convictions.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.956
Will your office
be seeking the mandatory
five in this case?

05:23.056 --> 05:24.558
Absolutely,
Your Honor.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.696
Very well, I'll take that
into consideration.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.667
Got his attention,
at least.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.275
Hey, Lieutenant,
come have a taste.

05:42.376 --> 05:45.379
Aw, come on,
we're celebrating.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.948
Patrick's going out
on medical.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.652
Sweet,
sweet cervical six.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.922
My shoulder's numb,
my arm's numb.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.458
My fingers feel
like they belong
to some son of a bitch

05:57.558 --> 05:59.092
in the next county.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.530
This is my ticket out of
this rat-shit department.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.032
66 and 2/3s pension

06:05.132 --> 06:07.468
and I don't have
to wait to for my 30.
I'm gone.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.470
Fucking yo
did you a favor.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.539
Kid hit like a mule,
I gotta say.

06:11.639 --> 06:12.806
Daniels:
You should take
a couple days.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.543
Think it over
before you put in papers.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.278
My brother-in-law's got
a video store out on Moravia.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.981
Does 6,000 a week
straight rentals,

06:21.081 --> 06:24.552
another 8,000 in porn.
He needs a partner.

06:24.652 --> 06:27.187
But, Paddy, they take that off
the top of a medical pension.

06:27.287 --> 06:28.589
If you report it
as income, they do.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.691
Do I look that
fucking stupid?

06:30.791 --> 06:33.427
Have a nice life,
Lieutenant.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.037
( door closes )

06:44.137 --> 06:46.039
What's with you?

06:46.139 --> 06:48.842
You gonna miss me,
Augs?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.211
What the fuck
am I gonna do, Paddy?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.313
Tell you what.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.049
What do you say
we go out together?

06:56.149 --> 06:57.685
What do ya mean?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.453
I mean, it only hurts
for a minute.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.354
And it doesn't have
to be line-of-duty either.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.290
I'm serious.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.392
You know those stairs where
they send us down the basement?

07:05.493 --> 07:07.728
- Yeah.
- It's dark down there.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.663
You go up
eight or nine steps,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.732
let go of the rail,
take a little jump.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.134
I'll break
my fucking neck like that.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.603
You don't break nothin'.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.405
You do a little dance
on those steps,

07:18.506 --> 07:20.373
you're up to
2/3s with me.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.110
And maybe you sue the city,
get a little more.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.181
Can't say
we don't deserve it.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.552
Five in?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.521
For a one-and-one?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.889
Now, why bang me like
that for a one-and-one?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.625
Greggs:
'Cause it's your turn,
Mr. Browning.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.527
Everybody out there
gets a turn.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.529
Oh, well, y'all
runnin' wild up in here.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.497
I'm thinking a judge might
want to take a look at this

07:43.597 --> 07:45.533
and slow y'all
down a mite.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.834
Well, I don't know,
Marvin.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.536
I'm lookin' at
your sheet here

07:48.636 --> 07:51.038
and, well,
for one thing,

07:51.138 --> 07:53.373
it's a little wrong
to be calling it a sheet.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.942
More like a book.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.344
Point is, we've got
the room to get a little
crazy on you.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.412
Like she said,
it's your turn.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.381
Greggs:
Tell us some stories,

08:01.481 --> 08:04.017
might could be
somebody else's turn.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.587
Stories.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.657
- Avon Barksdale.
- ( laughs )

08:10.658 --> 08:12.092
Know the name?

08:12.192 --> 08:14.294
Every motherfucker up
in them towers know the name.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.297
Myself, I ain't never really
had a word with the man.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.366
Stringer Bell then.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.602
Wee-Bey, Savino?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.738
Stinkum, CCO,
Roc-Roc?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.675
Well, who you gonna
give us, Marvin?

08:27.775 --> 08:31.378
You don't say a name soon,
you're gonna be courtside.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.547
A'ight.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.816
A'ight?
A'ight, what?

08:35.916 --> 08:39.186
A'ight,
I'll take the years.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.866
Damn, boy.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.570
You should
see the cop.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.439
When you're ready to get up,
put that on.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.909
Report to bunk A-7.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.177
A-7.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.914
Don't be later
than breakfast.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.849
Hey.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.118
Who else is
up in here?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.986
Anybody from
Westside?

09:13.086 --> 09:16.556
DC boys, mostly.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.995
( chattering )

10:42.309 --> 10:44.745
Radio:
The outer loop of the beltway,
quite slow at Telegraph,

10:44.845 --> 10:46.780
getting past
the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.081
Long fucking drive.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.550
Me and you drawing
another shit detail.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.920
This ain't
a shit detail.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.221
No?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.823
I'm in upper fucking
Marlboro, Maryland

10:55.923 --> 10:58.225
and still going south.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.360
But look...
another cow.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.595
( laughs )

11:02.696 --> 11:05.565
Use your imagination.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.000
This little
shitbird,

11:07.100 --> 11:09.369
having already been
whipped good by us once,

11:09.469 --> 11:12.239
he sees us, right?
And he starts cryin'
like a little bitch,

11:12.339 --> 11:14.708
'cause he knows that
we drove all the way down
to Prince George's

11:14.808 --> 11:16.276
for more
of his ass, right?

11:16.376 --> 11:20.480
Imagine we jack him up,
toss him into a small room,

11:20.580 --> 11:22.515
and tell him
that Detective Mahone

11:22.615 --> 11:24.517
is near dead
from the sucker punch.

11:24.617 --> 11:25.986
No shit,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.255
the drunk old fuck
suddenly slipped into a coma,

11:28.355 --> 11:30.858
and now the commissioner
and Mrs. Mahone

11:30.958 --> 11:32.793
are at his bedside
in the ICU

11:32.893 --> 11:34.661
and we've been ordered
to come down here,

11:34.762 --> 11:37.030
rip off his scrotum,
put it in a jar

11:37.130 --> 11:38.665
and drive it
back to Baltimore

11:38.766 --> 11:40.734
so it can sit with
the fucking bowling trophies

11:40.834 --> 11:43.570
behind the bar
at the FOP lodge.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.038
( laughs )

11:45.138 --> 11:47.040
All right?
After which...

11:47.140 --> 11:50.110
fuck-nuts stops
whimpering long enough

11:50.210 --> 11:53.180
to just start
giving people up, whoever.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.215
Stringer Bell.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.483
Avon Barksdale.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.151
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.653
Little prick
turns on everybody

12:00.754 --> 12:04.524
and we break the case
wide open.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.459
Cool.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.895
Right?

12:24.544 --> 12:27.480
Bunk:
So, from all them hand
to hands, nobody flipped?

12:27.580 --> 12:31.084
No, that part of town,
Barksdale carries more
weight than we do.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.653
Just like all these
fucking homicides.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.623
Witnesses lying,
witnesses paid off,

12:36.723 --> 12:38.191
witnesses backing up
on their story.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.827
Can you blame 'em?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.528
Not really.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.797
Every now and then
we visit the projects,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.065
they live there.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.534
Your man's
Dee, right?

12:47.634 --> 12:48.802
D'Angelo, yeah.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.304
This one's got a Dee
as a possible shooter.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.040
This one connects.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.641
No way.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.810
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.547
It's Deidre Kresson,
one of Keeley's cases.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.715
Come on, Jay,
this is a college girl

13:02.816 --> 13:05.285
blown up in the kitchen
of an apartment up
in Northeast.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.955
How does this match
with all the rest of these
Westside project mopes?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.689
They don't have cars?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.024
This doesn't match, Jay.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
Sure it does, take a look
at your office report.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.595
You got a witness
who puts her with a Dee
the night she's aced.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.231
How many Dee's you think
there are in the system, Jay?

13:18.331 --> 13:19.967
As a street name?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.534
Let me ask you
something, Jimmy.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.103
How many case files
you got here

13:23.203 --> 13:24.704
that you're putting
on Barksdale?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.639
Maybe a dozen.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.008
A dozen cases.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.310
So, how many of those
are from our squad?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.646
One, Gerard Bogue.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.182
One case...

13:35.282 --> 13:37.885
your squad's down a man
for weeks, Jimmy.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.719
We're gonna be
humping your calls,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.521
catching your cases,
you know,

13:41.621 --> 13:44.992
hopping around like
a one-legged pigtown whore
on check day,

13:45.092 --> 13:46.726
and for what?
So that you can have
your big adventure

13:46.826 --> 13:48.128
and solve everybody
else's cases?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.730
Is this
what I'm hearing?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.165
He's got you, Jimmy.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.368
Where's the love,
McNulty?

13:55.468 --> 13:56.736
Show me
some fucking love.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.938
All right.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.108
Attaboy,
he's my son.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.317
Why don't you just dump
this loser on Santangelo?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.119
He's supposed to be down
here helping us anyway.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.954
I would if I could
find the fucker.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.289
Must have another job,
he's gone so much.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.790
What does Daniels
have to say about that?

14:17.891 --> 14:19.559
Nothing,
I cover for the guy.

14:19.659 --> 14:23.030
He's out in the wind
all day yesterday,
half the day before.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.033
Aw, man, Keeley
really dogged this one.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.935
Ain't nothing in here
but a 24

14:28.035 --> 14:30.770
and some crime scene
photos and this.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.740
"Tywanda called, NFD,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.775
no last name, no address.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.047
claims your victim killed
after being visited
by a suspect named Dee."

14:40.147 --> 14:43.216
No further description.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.219
There's a callback
number, though.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.421
So, call.

15:02.970 --> 15:06.339
( phone ringing )

15:06.439 --> 15:09.542
The number you have reached,
has been disconnected.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.679
Disconnected.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.847
He got you, Jimmy.

15:14.948 --> 15:18.485
All right, motherfucker,
he got me, too.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.422
So, I'm gonna call Verizon,
see if they got a fresh listing.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.192
You happy now, bitch?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.296
Greggs:
You sure 'bout
that tag, Bubs?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.431
I seen the van.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.801
It cleared the court
and rolled up Amity
toward Lexington.

15:34.901 --> 15:38.505
Plates was reported stolen
off a car parked right here,
on this block.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.840
So you thinkin' they from
right around here, right?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.043
Maybe.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.612
Word in the towers said
it was Omar and his crew.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.615
Omar, who's he?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.050
You ain't know Omar?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.518
Omar, the terror.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.421
Been rippin' and robbin'
out here, for years now.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.622
Is he fierce?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.024
That nigga don't play.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.725
Got a last name?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.093
Just Omar.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.894
He don't need
no last name.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.930
Who's his family?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.732
You remember
No-Heart Anthony?

16:05.832 --> 16:07.600
Came up with him,
they brothers.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.602
No-Heart Anthony?

16:09.702 --> 16:12.405
Miss Kima,
do not tell me

16:12.505 --> 16:15.242

No-Heart Anthony.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.278
Damn, girl.
What town you been policin'
at all these years?

16:18.378 --> 16:22.649
And right now, I am personally
ashamed to be your snitch.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.753
( pager beeps )

16:26.853 --> 16:28.688
- Aw, shit, fuck.
- What?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.423
I'm late

16:30.523 --> 16:31.958

16:32.059 --> 16:34.694

- Radio: 12-14.

16:34.794 --> 16:39.099
Requesting anyone
in my unit who's up

16:39.199 --> 16:41.401
35, I got that.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.910
Package be movin'.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.979

16:53.080 --> 16:54.847
It's a sweet score?

16:54.947 --> 16:57.384
Yeah, it's a'ight.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.388
That play was a little bit
raggedy in there, though.

17:01.488 --> 17:05.892
I fucked up, I know,
lettin' go your name.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.694

17:08.795 --> 17:12.132
Everybody in these projects

17:12.232 --> 17:16.703
I just don't want

17:21.441 --> 17:23.410
Shirley comin'
with her game.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.779
Every fuckin' day

17:26.878 --> 17:28.681

17:28.781 --> 17:31.651

17:58.044 --> 18:01.013
So, what next, yo?

18:01.114 --> 18:03.049
Got some irons,

18:03.150 --> 18:06.119

on the Eastside,

18:06.219 --> 18:07.787
'til things

18:07.887 --> 18:10.490
That'll work.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.226
So, what up, man,
you don't wanna lay

18:13.326 --> 18:14.794

18:14.894 --> 18:18.064
Naw, I'm gonna

18:18.165 --> 18:19.866
Keep it close.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.635
Hear that.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.549
Who the man, huh?

18:47.294 --> 18:49.429
Hey, I gotta

18:49.529 --> 18:51.298
But I'll run him
back downtown after.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.601
No problem,
thanks for answering.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.439
- Hey, Bubs.
- Hey, McNutty.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.477
What's up?

19:04.577 --> 19:07.347
You ever heard of
No-Heart Anthony?

19:07.447 --> 19:10.283

19:10.383 --> 19:13.453

19:13.553 --> 19:16.356
He's up in Hagerstown

19:16.456 --> 19:19.192
- What about him?
- My man.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.431
Fuck y'all.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.335
You know how them cracker
motherfuckers do

19:28.435 --> 19:30.169

kill a deer?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.005
Or, like, when they go out
killing animals and whatnot?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.507
Got 'em on the front
of the truck,

19:34.607 --> 19:38.144
tied up, stretched out,
so everybody could see it?

19:38.245 --> 19:41.113
You feel me?

19:41.214 --> 19:43.550
I'm serious,
that's what I want.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.818
I want that motherfucker

19:45.918 --> 19:49.389
I'm gonna send a message

19:51.324 --> 19:53.426

Yeah, Bird's on it.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.402

20:02.502 --> 20:05.004
You know, Bird jailed

20:05.104 --> 20:08.107

20:08.207 --> 20:10.042

20:12.412 --> 20:15.848
This punk motherfucker

20:15.948 --> 20:19.051
So, he gotta a lotta heart

20:19.151 --> 20:22.989
Yo, yo, yo, we doubling

20:29.296 --> 20:31.163

20:31.264 --> 20:32.565
Take care

20:32.665 --> 20:36.102
Stickup come up dead

20:36.202 --> 20:38.905
Police jumpin'

20:39.005 --> 20:40.740
Something up

20:40.840 --> 20:42.809
Maybe, yeah.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.212
What's up

20:46.313 --> 20:47.747

21:31.558 --> 21:34.661
Man:

21:37.630 --> 21:40.400
Woman:

21:42.769 --> 21:44.837
Whoo!

21:51.110 --> 21:54.514

21:54.614 --> 21:56.015

21:56.115 --> 21:59.151

22:01.688 --> 22:03.890
Four-one, who got

22:03.990 --> 22:06.926

- Assist, that's good.

22:07.026 --> 22:10.663
Hey, you got to drink

22:10.763 --> 22:12.264
I don't want you

22:12.365 --> 22:15.101
- Hey.

- Bye, Dad.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.914
You're late.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.149
He thought you weren't
gonna come this time either.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.951
This job,

22:32.051 --> 22:34.454
I can't get out here when
he gets off the bus at 4:00.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.923
I need more than

22:37.023 --> 22:38.825
He needs me more than that,
so does Sean.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.760
I'm not giving up
anymore weekends.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.829
50-50 split's
all my lawyer says
I have to give.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.932
It's not 50-50 if I don't
see him all goddamn week.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.267
- You see him every day--
- Don't curse at me.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.404
- My lawyer says that--
- Fuck your lawyer.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.006
Fuck you.
Fuck you!

22:54.106 --> 22:57.977
( parents cheering )

22:58.077 --> 22:59.546
Did you see,

22:59.646 --> 23:03.516
Yeah, yeah,

23:03.616 --> 23:05.952
Come on, you get out.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.161
( children laughing )

23:22.635 --> 23:25.171
This good for you?

23:25.271 --> 23:27.474
Um-hmm.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.912
It's a thin line
between heaven and here.

23:45.124 --> 23:48.427
( dog barking )

24:05.812 --> 24:07.379
How he know

24:07.480 --> 24:09.716
The knockos don't
know, but he do

24:09.816 --> 24:11.551
'cause some nigga

24:11.651 --> 24:13.653
Man, ain't nobody
got to be snitchin'
for Omar

24:13.753 --> 24:16.388
or one of his boys
to creep by and see
where the stash at.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.725
Damn, Bodie.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.761
- Fuck that nigga up.
- They stomped his ass.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.732
How he ain't courtside
for banking a knocko?

24:26.766 --> 24:29.836
Boy, how you get
home so quick?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.138
Nigga, what you steal?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.206
Camry XLE.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.242
Y'all want a ride?
It's right around the corner.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.346
Man, Boys Village
ain't shit.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.114
I'm just too bad
for that off-brand,

24:42.214 --> 24:45.251
little-boy bullshit, man,
it can't hold me.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.890
What you laughin' at?
What's so funny?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.827
If you was me, your ass
would still be down there.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.599
You ever seen
a city jail, nigga?

24:59.699 --> 25:02.101
You ever caught a body?

25:02.201 --> 25:04.370
I'm the one who
just got home, remember?

25:04.470 --> 25:07.073
Eight months
over on Eager Street,
with a body on me, nigga.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.141
- Yeah, you got the one.
- Yeah, the one you know about.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.044
Man, y'all little
motherfuckers need
to ask around.

25:14.947 --> 25:18.685
Yo, out near the county right,
on the high end of the Eastside,

25:18.785 --> 25:21.187
they got these apartments,
out there, right?

25:21.287 --> 25:24.423
So there was this little shorty
who used to stay out there.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.627
She was like...

25:28.928 --> 25:32.765
I mean, I ain't seen
a female that fine since.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.668
I gotta say,
shorty was right.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.670
You fucked her?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.538
Naw, man,
it wasn't like that.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.841
This was a shorty
my uncle was messing with.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.377
So, you know, they was going
on at it for a little while

25:45.477 --> 25:48.615
'til she find out that
my uncle got another little
shorty 'round the way.

25:48.715 --> 25:53.452
More right to say he got
a few of 'em around the way.
Know what I'm sayin'?

25:53.552 --> 25:54.854
So, she goes off
the hook and shit,

25:54.954 --> 25:56.723
talking about she gonna
call the police,

25:56.823 --> 25:59.358
start talking about shit
she ain't supposed
to know about.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.694
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, you know it.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.996
But see, I got some
creep to me

26:04.096 --> 26:06.866
and my uncle,
he know that shit.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.168
So they roll me
out past her crib

26:09.268 --> 26:12.705
and they show me how she lives
right on the ground floor.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.941
Right?
First level.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.276
You know,

26:17.376 --> 26:19.812
I go creeping around the back,
to the back window.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.915
I got the four-five
on me, the big gun.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.351
And I walk up to the window
and I look in

26:25.451 --> 26:28.721
and it's dark as shit
'cause it's like 3:00 in
the damn morning and shit.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.090
You know,
you can't see shit.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.525
Whatcha do?

26:33.626 --> 26:37.830
So, I pulled out the piece
and I start tappin'

26:37.930 --> 26:40.299
with the back of it
on the window.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.934
And it was quiet,
you know,

26:42.034 --> 26:44.436
but it was loud enough
so she can hear that shit.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.907
Tap, tap, tap.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.309
That's what
she heard, yo.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.278
Sure enough,
she comes out.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.781
She's naked and shit.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.917
I don't know why the fuck,
but, she has a robe.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.986
And as she slipping on her robe,
she turns on the light,

27:00.086 --> 27:02.722
and you know,
when she does that,

27:02.822 --> 27:04.657
and it's light
on the inside,

27:04.757 --> 27:06.793
she can't see shit
on the outside.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.796
Damn, she naked.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.499
Tap, tap, tap.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.802
She hears that shit
on the window

27:15.902 --> 27:17.603
and she ain't got no choice
but to walk over there

27:17.704 --> 27:20.106
and see what it is.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.141
She steps up,

27:22.241 --> 27:24.643
looks out,

27:24.744 --> 27:27.313
see where
it's coming from.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.052
What happened?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.924
He shot her.

27:40.526 --> 27:43.462
Yo, Dee,
if she was all that,

27:43.562 --> 27:45.597
why ain't you
fuck her first?

27:45.698 --> 27:47.867
Nigga, you sick,
just shut up.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.969
What?
I'm just saying.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.204
There is something
seriously wrong.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.378
This is ridiculous.

27:59.478 --> 28:03.582
Because a lab
freezer goes out with
an electrical short,

28:03.682 --> 28:07.386
blood samples
in 56 homicides,

28:07.486 --> 28:11.290
15 rapes are allowed
to putrefy.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.793
State's attorney knows?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.594
The mayor, too.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.766
Most of our trace lab
is now 25 years old.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.102
You ever go outside
for money?

28:23.202 --> 28:24.470
The non-profits?

28:24.570 --> 28:25.872
Such as?

28:25.972 --> 28:27.874
The Abell Foundation,
for one.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.308
My brother's
on the board,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.643
if you want me to run
it up there for you.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.612
You could swing that?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.915
Never hurts to ask,
does it?

28:36.015 --> 28:39.351
It never does,
Your Honor.

28:39.451 --> 28:42.221
So, in that same spirit,

28:42.321 --> 28:44.356
where are we with
the Barksdale probe?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.759
Well...

28:46.859 --> 28:49.261
my other reason
for stopping by.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.305
Hand-to-hands and
search-and-seizures,
I've heard about these.

28:59.405 --> 29:02.041
Well, some mid-level players
caught up, as you can see.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.944
Look, it's not
a knockout blow,

29:05.044 --> 29:07.346
but we sent
a clear message.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.050
I don't see Barksdale's
name anywhere.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.652
Or Bell, or anything
about the murders.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.155
The casework,
it goes towards that.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.557
Well...

29:18.657 --> 29:21.393
so, we've got
work to do,

29:21.493 --> 29:23.762
don't we?

29:25.865 --> 29:27.766
( TV playing )

29:27.867 --> 29:30.102
( knocking )

29:32.704 --> 29:36.575
Herc:
Police, open the damn door.
Open the damn door!

29:36.675 --> 29:39.011
- Carver: Open the door!
- ( pounding )

29:39.111 --> 29:40.212
What?!

29:40.312 --> 29:42.548
Herc: Open
the motherfuckin' door!

29:54.060 --> 29:56.028
Upstairs front clear.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.729
Carver:
Kitchen's clear.

29:57.830 --> 30:00.799
I'm at the backdoor.
Anybody pop out here?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.302
All clear, quiet.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.504
Upstairs rear, clear.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.875
I'm gonna beat this bitch
like a red-headed stepchild,

30:08.975 --> 30:10.709
I find him hiding
up in this pisshole.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.445
Goddamn creepy crawlers
everywhere.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.084
Tell Bodie
we're on his ass.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.268
I'm sorry for cursing,
at the door, I mean, um...

30:36.368 --> 30:38.604
I couldn't see
that it was only you.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.940
Is it the drugs again?

30:42.608 --> 30:44.376
Would you like
to sit down?

30:46.845 --> 30:50.883
Preston came to me
when my daughter died.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.152
He was four years old,

30:53.252 --> 30:57.789
but even then
I knew he was angry.

30:57.890 --> 31:02.328
His mother lived out there,
caught up in it.

31:02.428 --> 31:06.966
After awhile, you couldn't
make her see nothing else.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.468
Carver:
Nah, man, nah,
that wasn't us.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.771
2:30 in the towers?
You guys are crazy, man.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.974
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.776
So, how you think
you gonna carry it?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.545
I'm sorry, ma'am,

31:19.645 --> 31:22.915
and I'm sorry for the way
we came through here.

31:24.917 --> 31:27.119
If Preston comes past...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.256
give him this

31:30.356 --> 31:33.392
and tell him
we need to talk, okay?

31:35.894 --> 31:37.930
I'm sorry.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.139
What the fuck
you doing in there?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.607
Talking.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.110
- Talking?
- Yeah.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.584
- See you later.
- A'ight, catch you later.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.619
I'm driving.

32:13.065 --> 32:16.035
( phone ringing )

32:24.776 --> 32:26.545
Yeah.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.316
McNulty.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.286
Some judge for you.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.227
Yeah?

32:42.428 --> 32:45.231
Well, can I
call you back?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.504
( knocks )

32:52.604 --> 32:54.773
- Major, sir?
- Yeah.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.143
( door closes )

32:57.243 --> 32:58.577
I been thinking.

32:58.677 --> 33:01.413
It's a clear violation
of the general orders,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.515
I know, but...

33:09.288 --> 33:11.190
last night,
I'm at home.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.624
I'm sitting up
buck naked.

33:12.724 --> 33:17.129
And I got one hand wrapped
around a cold domestic beer,

33:17.229 --> 33:19.765
and the other wrapped around
my magnificent, flaccid,

33:19.865 --> 33:21.300
four-and-one-half
inch wonder.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.336
And I am trying
with all my might

33:24.436 --> 33:27.339
to remember
what Leila Kaufman's
nipples looked like

33:27.439 --> 33:30.309
when her bathing top
slipped off

33:30.409 --> 33:31.777
at the Hillendale
Pool swim party.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.313
( laughs )
Leila Kaufman?

33:34.413 --> 33:37.516
Yes, sir,
summer of '72.

33:37.616 --> 33:42.020
I got this saucy
wench in my gunsights,
so to speak,

33:42.121 --> 33:45.791
and I am dangerously

33:45.891 --> 33:49.161
close to engorged,

33:49.261 --> 33:52.531
when all of a fucking sudden
out of fucking nowhere,

33:52.631 --> 33:57.436
fucking Detective,
fucking Jimmy McNulty
pops into my head.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.138
McNulty?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.207
Obviously, I gotta open
my eyes and admit to myself,

34:01.307 --> 34:03.542
that my whole night
is ruined.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.344
At which point,
I got nothing to do,

34:05.444 --> 34:07.379
but think about the problems
of Jimmy McNulty.

34:07.479 --> 34:11.483
Because, clearly, this guy
and his fucking problems

34:11.583 --> 34:13.851
are standing between me
and all worldly pleasure.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.853
Clearly.

34:15.954 --> 34:19.690
First of all,
it's not Jimmy's fault.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.760
No?

34:21.860 --> 34:25.097
No, Jimmy is
an addict, sir.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.998
What's he addicted to?

34:27.099 --> 34:29.967
- Himself.
- ( laughs )

34:30.068 --> 34:31.937
It's not funny, sir.

34:32.036 --> 34:35.474
A matter of fact,
it's a fucking tragedy
is what it is.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.310
The guy, he has
come to believe

34:38.409 --> 34:41.447
that he is always
the smartest fuck
in the room.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.915
And you know what?
It's not his fault.

34:44.014 --> 34:47.753
Because, let's face it,
he's not going to Johns
Hopkins or joining Mensa,

34:47.853 --> 34:49.020
he's taking
a fucking job

34:49.121 --> 34:50.789
with the Baltimore
Police Department.

34:50.889 --> 34:54.393
His first two years
in homicide, he's in
Ulmansky's squad,

34:54.493 --> 34:56.295
partnered with
Tony Lamartino.

34:56.395 --> 35:00.132
Uh, Christ, it must've
been months even,

35:00.232 --> 35:02.634
he was the smartest fuck
in the fucking room.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.303
What's your point, Jay?

35:04.403 --> 35:08.874
My point is
he can't help it.

35:08.974 --> 35:13.011
It makes him
an asshole, I know,

35:13.111 --> 35:17.249
but it's also what
makes him good police.

35:19.418 --> 35:23.422
Last year, he gives me
eight clearances.

35:23.522 --> 35:28.160
One of them was
a decomp floater

35:28.260 --> 35:30.296
who was John Doe
for three weeks.

35:41.106 --> 35:44.343
Tell your boy to wrap up that
bullshit detail in two weeks.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.678
He does that,
he comes home,

35:46.778 --> 35:48.680
clean slate.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.263
Phelan:
You'da loved it.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.664
Burrell is sitting
across from me

36:05.764 --> 36:07.466
with a handful
of street-level arrests,

36:07.566 --> 36:09.301
pretending
he has a plan.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.936
So, what did
you tell him?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.971
Never shit a shitter,
Deputy.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.573
That's what I
fucking told him.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.942
I did good,
right, Jimmy?

36:17.042 --> 36:18.944
I gotta go.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.486
( soft music playing )

36:29.755 --> 36:32.758
"Discuss the Hicks ruling
as a manifestation

36:32.858 --> 36:36.495
of the judiciary's attempt
to maintain a speedy disposition

36:36.595 --> 36:39.465
of criminal cases within
a modern court system."

36:39.565 --> 36:41.833
What?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.670
That's what I say,

36:44.770 --> 36:46.104
"What?"

36:46.204 --> 36:48.139
What the hell's
the Hicks ruling?

36:48.240 --> 36:51.076
Did you highlight
my sofa?

36:51.176 --> 36:52.878
What? No.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.413
Yes, you did.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.715
That was there
from before.

36:56.815 --> 36:57.983
Hell, it was.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.851
Damn, Kima,
marker does not come out.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.453
I didn't do it,
I swear.

37:01.553 --> 37:04.222
Okay, let me see
the marker.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.492
You want my marker,
I need to see a warrant.

37:06.592 --> 37:10.262
I'm serious, I need
to see some probable cause.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.163
I'm gonna
beat your ass.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.799
How about that
for probable cause?

37:13.899 --> 37:15.233
Gimme,
gimme that marker.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.769
Damn, gettin' all
violent and shit.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.539
You know you just violated
my civil rights, huh?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.708
That's it, new rule.
No marker on the couch.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.744
You get over to that table
over there and do your homework.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.314
Go, take it and go.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.483
- Gimme my maker.
- Thank you, mm-hmm.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.465
I'm gonna need
some club soda.

37:46.565 --> 37:50.469
Damn, girl, this cellphone bill
must eat up the paycheck.

37:50.569 --> 37:54.640
No, most of that's work,
it's on the company.

38:02.814 --> 38:04.583
Phelan won't let go.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.152
Are we anywhere
close on Barksdale?

38:07.252 --> 38:09.087
No, sir.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.756
So, what are you
telling me?

38:10.856 --> 38:12.591
I'm not telling
you anything, sir.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.393
I'm waiting for you
to tell me.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.028
I can do whatever you
need me to do with this.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.998
If you want me
to push it further,
I can do that.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.501
If you want it
to go away.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.205
And if you want to
bring in someone else,

38:27.305 --> 38:28.874
maybe do things
differently.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.211
You looking
for the back door,
Lieutenant?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.613
Already?

38:34.713 --> 38:38.384
McNulty says
this case needs a wire.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.420
You think he's right?

38:44.189 --> 38:46.725
It needs something.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.970
Just climb your ass up
the pole, man.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.608
Naw, naw, man,
this'll work.

39:03.942 --> 39:07.746
I'm not climbing
no damn ladder.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.883
You ain't never going
to hit it, man.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.786
Bomb!
Housing must think
we just dumb.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.488
- ( pager beeping )
- Is that--

39:16.588 --> 39:17.889
that's your pager
or mine?

39:17.989 --> 39:19.725
That's me,
that's me.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.494
Yo, watch that shit
on my head.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.663
Hey, man, it ricocheted
off the fucking camera.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.399
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you need some aim.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.515
- ( phone ringing )
- Hmph.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.386
Dee:
Yo, who this?

40:08.206 --> 40:09.841
So, what
do you think?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.443
A title three?

40:11.543 --> 40:13.512
Right, but it's not
for a wiretap.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.381
It's to clone a pager,
I got it from Pearlman.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.116
Pagers, huh?

40:18.216 --> 40:19.618
Some kind of
throwback thing.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.620
You mean
why not cell phones?

40:21.720 --> 40:23.489
Right, who uses
pagers anymore?

40:23.589 --> 40:25.457
Tell you what,

40:25.557 --> 40:28.093
I was checking out
a wireless bill last night.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.295
Every incoming call
was listed.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.730
Right.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.199
So, if we get
Barksdale's pager,

40:34.299 --> 40:35.601
we might get off
the street.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.636
Maybe even
trace some supply.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.542
So, who's
No-Heart Anthony?

40:43.642 --> 40:46.678
No-Heart ran drugs
in the Homes in
the early '90s.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.580
So, a couple years back,
I don't know why,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.215
he finds himself
in Randallstown

40:50.315 --> 40:51.950
trying to take off
a jewelry store.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.384
He fucks it up,

40:53.485 --> 40:55.887
half the county
chases him back downtown.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.824
And I guess No-Heart
figures he's not up
for doing the time,

40:58.924 --> 41:01.259
'cause he puts a four-four
against his chest,

41:01.359 --> 41:02.928
pulls the trigger.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.530
A .44?

41:04.630 --> 41:06.732
Gets a contact wound,

41:06.832 --> 41:09.868
wakes up two hours later
in the University ER.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.103
With a new nickname.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.805
Right.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.708
Bubbles says
it's Anthony's brother

41:16.808 --> 41:19.110
who took off with
the Barksdale stash
the other night.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.680
Dude named Omar.

41:21.780 --> 41:26.451
It's not the easiest trade,
you know, robbing dealers.

41:26.552 --> 41:30.522
Man like that is likely
to have a weapon on him.

41:30.622 --> 41:33.559
We jack him up,
there's a charge
to work off.

41:33.659 --> 41:36.828
And if he knows where
the Barksdale stash is,

41:36.928 --> 41:39.865
he probably knows
a whole lot more.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.366
See?

41:41.466 --> 41:43.902
Another plan.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.487
The thing is, we're gonna
have to sell this.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.356
You want to raise it
with Daniels?

42:05.456 --> 42:07.893
He'll listen
to you more than me.

42:12.931 --> 42:14.833
Daniels:
Where's Santangelo?

42:14.933 --> 42:16.802
Oh, he's--
he's at ECU.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.837
He's got a case
going today.

42:20.405 --> 42:23.208
Well, as of today,
I haven't heard anything
to the contrary, so...

42:24.509 --> 42:26.211
so we're
gonna press on.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.749
Ideas?

42:30.849 --> 42:33.652
We can continue
with the buys.

42:35.987 --> 42:38.590
But I don't think
that's gonna get us
too far off the street.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.225
On the other hand,

42:40.325 --> 42:41.993
the people we pulled in
last week had pagers.

42:42.093 --> 42:45.063
So did D'Angelo Barksdale
when McNulty jacked him up.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.866
We could try to clone
a couple of pagers and see
where that takes us.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.168
- Clone what?
- Their pagers.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.704
They get beeped,
we get beeped.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.405
We see who's calling
and from what number.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.475
If these guys are all that,
why they still using pagers?

42:57.575 --> 42:59.911
Why not un-ass a few dollars
for cell phones?

43:00.011 --> 43:03.181
Freamon:
It's a discipline.

43:04.315 --> 43:07.318
You can't bug a pager.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.921
But you can't make a call
with a pager, either.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.690
You're gonna want
a pen register

43:11.790 --> 43:13.491
on all the payphones
in the low-rises

43:13.591 --> 43:16.895
and any other phones
that link to the pagers.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.097
What would it take
to do the pagers?

43:19.197 --> 43:20.899
A wiretap affidavit.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.835
I think we've got enough
PC from the hand-to-hands
and surveillance.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.203
We got most
of the exhaustion.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.038
I'm exhausted just
listening to this shit.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.408
Good, exhaustion
is a legal requirement

43:30.508 --> 43:32.577
for using
electronic intercepts.

43:32.678 --> 43:34.713
We gotta prove
nothing else works.

43:34.813 --> 43:36.147
See, we did
the raids,

43:36.247 --> 43:38.249
we made the arrests,
but nobody flipped.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.318
We don't have an informant
who takes us anywhere
above the street.

43:40.418 --> 43:42.087
That's pretty much
exhaustion.

43:42.187 --> 43:44.656
All we got left
to do now, is to follow
one of these mopes

43:44.756 --> 43:46.658
and prove to ourselves
that we can't do it.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.694
See, we try to show
a judge we can't make a case

43:48.794 --> 43:50.662
by following these guys.
And we can't.

43:50.762 --> 43:53.531
How can we keep on
any of them when they
go up in those towers?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.834
But you gotta
show you tried.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.773
Do we have
a pager number?

44:09.981 --> 44:12.718
This was written
on the stash house wall

44:12.818 --> 44:15.153
with the letter "D"
next to it.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.689
Is that D'Angelo?

44:17.789 --> 44:19.590
Did you check it?

44:19.691 --> 44:21.860
It's him.

44:34.572 --> 44:36.674
Let's do this.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.749
Herc:
What does he want us to do?

44:43.849 --> 44:45.851
I don't understand.

44:45.951 --> 44:48.887
Carver:
I'll explain it to you
if you buy me breakfast.

45:01.833 --> 45:04.102
Will you explain to me again
why I'm about to rework

45:04.202 --> 45:05.771
a six-month-old
crime scene?

45:05.871 --> 45:07.472
Look at this
narrow-ass file.

45:07.572 --> 45:08.740
Keeley didn't
do shit on this.

45:08.840 --> 45:09.941
He did the scene though.

45:10.041 --> 45:11.542
This is Keeley
we're talking about.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.678
Fucking Jay
and his leaps of logic.

45:13.779 --> 45:15.713
This case is nowhere near
anything we're doing.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.883
So, give it a shake
or two anyhow.

45:17.983 --> 45:20.752
- Make a sergeant happy.
- Whatever.

45:20.852 --> 45:22.487
Hey, did you know
Lester Freamon?

45:22.587 --> 45:24.722
Mm-hmm.
A little, why?

45:24.823 --> 45:26.892
He's with us
on this Barksdale thing.

45:26.992 --> 45:28.894
I thought you said
they gave you humps.

45:28.994 --> 45:30.962
He looks like a hump,
he acts like a hump,

45:31.062 --> 45:33.231
sittin' there,
playing with his
toy furniture.

45:33.331 --> 45:36.034
Jimmy, he makes
more money off that shit

45:36.134 --> 45:37.435
than you do
off of this job.

45:37.535 --> 45:39.037
Don't let
Lester fool you.

45:39.137 --> 45:42.073
He did already.
But today in roll call,
he showed something.

45:42.173 --> 45:44.642
Hey, he's
a natural police.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.311
He used
to be homicide.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.880
- Why'd he leave?
- Ask him.

45:51.850 --> 45:53.418
This is the one, huh?

45:53.518 --> 45:55.186
Yep, hasn't been
rented since.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.467
Ah, fuck.

46:12.871 --> 46:15.106
Motherfucker.

46:23.882 --> 46:26.484
Fuck, fuck,
fucking fuck.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.889
Fuck.

46:37.262 --> 46:38.696
Fuck.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.832
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.006
What the fuck?

46:55.613 --> 46:58.083
Ah, fuck.

47:03.288 --> 47:04.890
Fuck.

47:33.919 --> 47:36.888
- No.
- Ah, fuck.

47:45.796 --> 47:47.332
Fuck it.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.235
How the fuck?

47:57.575 --> 47:59.911
Motherfuck.

48:05.183 --> 48:09.054
Aw, fuck.
Aw, fuck.

48:21.166 --> 48:24.970
Fuckity, fuck fuck,
fuck fuck, fucker.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.574
Ah, fuck.

48:29.674 --> 48:32.010
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:32.110 --> 48:35.413
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:43.955 --> 48:46.424
Motherfucker.

48:49.027 --> 48:50.928
Fuckin' A.

49:07.478 --> 49:09.114
Fuck.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.993
What's that?

49:22.093 --> 49:24.229
Motherfucker.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.699
Fuck me.

49:36.407 --> 49:37.742
Boom.

49:52.357 --> 49:54.925
( taps )

49:55.026 --> 49:57.395
Pow.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.795
Heh.

50:40.638 --> 50:43.474
Sydnor's on foot,
Carv's in the car,

50:43.574 --> 50:47.212
Herc, you need to be
on top of the roof
behind Amity.

50:47.312 --> 50:49.947
Again I get
the shit detail?

50:50.047 --> 50:52.083
The plan is
to stay on D'Angelo.

50:52.183 --> 50:54.185
We lose him,
we lose him, right?

50:54.285 --> 50:55.620
Oh, we're gonna
lose him.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.455
I mean, you can't follow
people in them towers.

50:57.555 --> 50:59.757
You can't even hang
in the low-rises unless
you got a reason.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.560
Just to make sure.
We want to lose him, right?

51:02.660 --> 51:04.829
Losing him is good?

51:04.929 --> 51:06.364
Right.

51:06.464 --> 51:08.065
Then why the fuck
do this?

51:08.166 --> 51:11.602
Come on, Herc, roll with
me on this one, all right?

51:24.081 --> 51:26.151
So, you're
a police after all.

51:28.453 --> 51:30.588
You know what you're doing,
but you ain't been doing it.

51:30.688 --> 51:32.757
How long you been
in the pawn shop unit?

51:32.857 --> 51:34.259
13 years
and four months.

51:34.359 --> 51:36.294
- 13 years?
- And four months.

51:36.394 --> 51:39.397
I gotta ask you,
what exactly does

51:39.497 --> 51:41.532
a police officer assigned
to the pawn shop unit do?

51:41.632 --> 51:44.001
You intake reports
from registered pawn shops

51:44.101 --> 51:46.103
on all items
valued over $50.

51:46.204 --> 51:48.273
Then you make an index card
for that item.

51:48.373 --> 51:50.275
Then you file
that index card.

51:50.375 --> 51:51.609
If someone wants
to find out

51:51.709 --> 51:53.144
if something stolen
has been pawned,

51:53.244 --> 51:54.445
we look to see if
we have an index card.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.214
If we do, we do,
if we don't, we don't.

51:56.314 --> 51:58.516
- You did that
for 13 years?
- And four months.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.151
Why'd you ask
out of homicide?

52:00.251 --> 52:02.153
- Wasn't no ask about it.
- You got the boot?

52:02.253 --> 52:04.155
- Uh-huh.
- What'd you do
to piss 'em off?

52:04.255 --> 52:06.023
Police work.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.394
I think I need
to buy you a drink.

52:10.595 --> 52:12.397
Just one?

52:13.464 --> 52:15.500
Caught this case
in the Brooklyn Homes.

52:15.600 --> 52:16.934
Summer of '87.

52:17.034 --> 52:20.104
80-year-old woman
stabbed up.

52:20.205 --> 52:23.174
Nightgown, in bed.
Forced window, rear entry.

52:23.274 --> 52:25.443
Worked it for
a couple weeks,

52:25.543 --> 52:27.578
got the names
of two squirrels
over in Curtis Bay.

52:27.678 --> 52:29.480
Squirrel number one
gives it up

52:29.580 --> 52:31.816
and tries to put
all the weight on
squirrel number two.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.484
Back up
the statements?

52:33.584 --> 52:35.886
Print hit on the window
for number two,

52:35.986 --> 52:38.088
another one for number one
on the medicine chest.

52:38.189 --> 52:40.691
- So, it's down, yeah?
- Mmm.

52:40.791 --> 52:43.661
Even better's
when squirrel number one
drives by the house

52:43.761 --> 52:45.463
where they fenced
the old lady's shit.

52:45.563 --> 52:48.699
Clock-radio, TV,
toaster oven.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.235
So, what's
the problem?

52:50.335 --> 52:52.603
The problem
is the fence.

52:52.703 --> 52:55.072
Turned out he was the son
of one of the big editors

52:55.172 --> 52:56.607
over at
the "News American."

52:56.707 --> 52:59.277
This man is running
the afternoon newspaper

52:59.377 --> 53:00.945
and his son is getting
all fucked up,

53:01.045 --> 53:03.614
doin' the dirt
and getting high
down in Locust Point.

53:03.714 --> 53:07.151
The deputy, who I guess
is in a favor-doin' mood,

53:07.252 --> 53:08.619
sends word down
to the major

53:08.719 --> 53:12.357
I'm supposed to make
the case without the fence.

53:12.457 --> 53:15.125
Just the print hits
and the statement.

53:15.226 --> 53:16.361
Play it like that.

53:16.461 --> 53:17.728
So, he's doin'
this for what?

53:17.828 --> 53:19.230
To have some newspaper
guy in his pocket?

53:19.330 --> 53:21.332
Yeah, I guess so.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.835
Is this Burrell?

53:24.935 --> 53:26.437
No, no, Mueller.

53:26.537 --> 53:27.972
Deputy ops
before Burrell.

53:28.072 --> 53:30.375
So, what did
you do?

53:30.475 --> 53:33.444
What do you
think I did?

53:33.544 --> 53:37.114
I charged him with receiving,
then had his ass testify.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.250
You could've made
the case without him.

53:39.350 --> 53:40.951
Just on prints
and the statements.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.654
Probably, yep.

53:45.089 --> 53:47.558
Why didn't you?

53:47.658 --> 53:49.394
Why?

53:51.028 --> 53:54.632
Why are you
fuckin' up yourself
chasing Avon Barksdale?

53:57.902 --> 54:01.205
A week after the trial ends,
major comes to me,

54:01.306 --> 54:02.773
asks me where I want to go.

54:02.873 --> 54:06.777
I tell him, I don't care,
I like to be outside, you know?

54:06.877 --> 54:08.579
Give me a goddamn footpost,

54:08.679 --> 54:10.281
I'll still make
my money, you know.

54:10.381 --> 54:12.350
Send my ass up
to Edmondson Avenue.
I don't give a shit.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.718
You went
to a footpost?

54:13.818 --> 54:16.821
Major, come back asks me
where I don't want to go.

54:16.921 --> 54:20.691
And he asks it like he wants
to be sure I land okay.

54:20.791 --> 54:24.161
So, I tell him, I don't want
no fucking paper-shuffle.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.996
No office shit.

54:26.096 --> 54:29.233
Send my black ass outside
and let me police somewhere.

54:29.334 --> 54:31.235
- Pawn shop unit.
- Uh-huh.

54:31.336 --> 54:33.438
- They got me good.
- ( laughs )

54:34.672 --> 54:36.641
So, why'd they let you
out of the box?

54:36.741 --> 54:38.676
Why now?

54:39.810 --> 54:42.079
I guess they just
forgot about me.

54:42.179 --> 54:45.282
Shit, Lester.

54:45.383 --> 54:48.185
You're back
from the dead.

54:48.285 --> 54:51.088
You rolled away
the stone.

54:51.188 --> 54:53.658
Bunk Moreland says
you're a natural police.

54:53.758 --> 54:55.326
One of the few.

54:55.426 --> 54:58.696
Yeah, I've had
my moments.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.633
Detective...

55:04.669 --> 55:06.904
when they ask you
where you want to go

55:07.004 --> 55:10.475
and they are gonna ask
you where you wanna go,

55:10.575 --> 55:15.580
do yourself a favor,
keep your mouth shut.

55:18.583 --> 55:21.218
I gotta take
a tinkle, boy.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.921
I got it.
I got it.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.823
All right.

55:38.369 --> 55:39.970
Oh, hello.

55:40.070 --> 55:42.006
Um...

55:42.106 --> 55:44.375
Is Kima there?

55:44.475 --> 55:45.643
And you are?

55:45.743 --> 55:48.713
Tell her it's--
it's McNulty.

55:58.823 --> 56:00.658
For you, Kima.

56:00.758 --> 56:02.993
A decidedly
confused white boy.

56:03.093 --> 56:04.629
Oh, God.

56:17.508 --> 56:20.377
How'd it go today?

56:22.179 --> 56:24.148
Lost him in
the 211.

56:24.248 --> 56:25.883
Picked him back up
in the low-rises,

56:25.983 --> 56:28.152
and then lost him
on Schroeder Street
after dark.

56:28.252 --> 56:30.455
Nicely done.

56:33.323 --> 56:34.892
Are you okay
to drive?

56:34.992 --> 56:36.293
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine.

56:36.393 --> 56:37.562
I just wanted to...

56:37.662 --> 56:39.196
I just wanted
to thank you.

56:39.296 --> 56:40.765
For what?

56:40.865 --> 56:44.635
For today, you know,
with Daniels.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.637
You should be
thanking Lester.

56:46.737 --> 56:50.541
Oh, I did.
I just wanted to thank you,
too, Detective Greggs.

56:53.343 --> 56:56.046
No problem.
Goodnight.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.982
That it is.

57:08.793 --> 57:10.427
What I miss?

57:10.528 --> 57:14.031
Nothin' much.
Lovelorn?

57:14.131 --> 57:16.801
Worse, lonely.

57:19.837 --> 57:22.740
You didn't make it
into class again today.

57:22.840 --> 57:25.910
You said
you'd stick with it.

57:26.010 --> 57:30.548
I'm trying, but things
are hot right now.

57:31.849 --> 57:34.051
I'm doing
the best I can.

57:34.151 --> 57:37.955
You said it yourself
you need to do something else.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.124
Something better for us.

57:40.224 --> 57:43.460
You promised.

57:46.430 --> 57:48.533
Oh, man.

57:50.868 --> 57:53.538
What am I gonna
do with you, huh?

57:53.638 --> 57:56.607
You know,
better women than you

57:56.707 --> 57:58.509
have fallen
for my tricks, right?

57:58.609 --> 58:01.211
( laughing )

58:17.361 --> 58:19.597
( theme music playing )

58:20.305 --> 58:26.584
