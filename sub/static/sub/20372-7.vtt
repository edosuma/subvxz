07:08.845 --> 07:11.348
Hal and Rita already think the only reason we don't have a kid

11:35.278 --> 11:36.571
Are you supposed to do that?

11:36.655 --> 11:38.323
Nope!

11:40.659 --> 11:42.076
Okay.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.454
Here's my bartender wisdom.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.333
You need to find out if the Griswolds are really in it

11:48.416 --> 11:50.377
before you waste any more of your hot years.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.212
You know what I'm getting real sick of?

11:52.295 --> 11:53.754
Trying harder than the other two

11:53.838 --> 11:55.423
to make this relationship work.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.342
Sorry, how was that? Oh, my God.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.469
What kind of relationship are you in?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.054
It doesn't matter. I got things to do.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.389
Yeah, you do,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.558
right after you fix that dude a martini.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.975
Oh, no hurry. I just come here

12:06.059 --> 12:07.352
to sit in a really uncomfortable chair

12:07.435 --> 12:10.230
and watch sports on my phone.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.984
So what do I do?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
You don't do anything.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.779
It's their move.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.657

12:43.846 --> 12:46.974
It's fine. I get it.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.853
Do you think we're making a mistake

12:50.937 --> 12:53.814
sending Izzy away every time she's an inconvenience?

12:53.898 --> 12:56.276
I mean, we already broke up with her twice.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.069
Yeah, but this is different.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.238
This is a...

13:00.321 --> 13:02.949
three-day elaborate lie. Yeah.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.492
Which, to her, probably means

13:04.576 --> 13:07.495
that we're not sure this is permanent, right?

13:07.579 --> 13:11.374
Which makes us the dickheads that she keeps calling us.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.627
Exactly. Okay, so what do we do?

13:13.710 --> 13:16.087
How do we explain her presence here?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.466
Housekeeper

13:19.549 --> 13:21.884
Okay, that's at least moderately racist.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.511
What? No. It's not racist at all.

13:23.595 --> 13:27.098
I didn't specify which accent, so...

13:28.182 --> 13:29.808
Ding, ding, ding.

13:29.892 --> 13:34.648
I have an idea, a brilliant idea that not only brings Izzy back

13:34.731 --> 13:37.816
but it makes my parents so happy that I won't need to take

13:37.900 --> 13:40.361
all the pain killers I've stored in the freezer.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.905

Hey, Michelle.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.208
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop--

13:54.292 --> 13:55.918
I'm not really "Notorious Orgy Girl."

13:56.002 --> 13:57.378
She was just joking.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.088
Don't care.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.881
So, when you said the name Andy,

14:00.965 --> 14:02.717
were you referring to Andy Cutler?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.469
I've seen you guys together, right?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.596
Yeah. So?

14:06.680 --> 14:10.099
Let me guess, things are getting real serious real fast

14:10.183 --> 14:12.644
even though he just got out of something else?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.646
Oh, well, maybe.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.690
Yeah, well, that's his thing.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.107
He's a love junkie.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.949
That's his shit.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.911
Might as well just get this over with.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.375

What was that?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.725
Oh, it's a rare Indian--

22:31.809 --> 22:33.227
No, no, no, you don't have to yell again.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.687
I just want to hear the last two ingredients.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.315
'Shrooms and Ayahuasca.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.030
Put the spoon in the bowl.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.116
Put the spoon in the bowl.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.703
You what?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.872
I-I would just like to point out once again,

22:52.955 --> 22:55.624
that I'm not being an asshole.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.001
Everyone makes mistakes.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.669
For example,

22:58.752 --> 23:02.006
sometimes your neighbors invite a young woman

23:02.089 --> 23:05.009
into their relationship who then goes on

23:05.092 --> 23:07.469
to teach your teenage daughter to do drugs.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.890
Can we not say "drugs" like I was tapping her veins?

23:10.973 --> 23:14.060
I gave her a little weed after she begged and pleaded

23:14.143 --> 23:16.020
and swore she wouldn't tell.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.521
And come the fuck on.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.773
You don't actually believe this was her first time.

23:21.441 --> 23:23.236
She's found my weed so many times,

23:23.319 --> 23:24.778
I've run out of hiding places

23:24.862 --> 23:26.446
that don't require cavity searches.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.615
So you were insinuating that Izzy

23:28.699 --> 23:31.077
introduced Ava to drugs, to what?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.661
Make this a bigger fucking deal?

23:32.745 --> 23:34.788
Mnh-mnh. Jack: Oh.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.124
If it talks like an asshole and walks like an asshole...

23:37.208 --> 23:39.960
Did you tell her that, uh... you and I smoked pot

23:40.044 --> 23:42.420
on that porch two nights ago?

23:42.504 --> 23:45.091
Wha-- You big, fat hypocrite!

23:45.174 --> 23:46.800
Okay. We--

23:46.884 --> 23:49.720
Do you remember when you briefly had credibility?

23:49.803 --> 23:51.264
Do you miss it?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.307
Does it keep in touch?

23:53.391 --> 23:55.309
Hey, Izzy, still,

23:55.393 --> 23:57.895
you did give Lori Matherfield's daughter pot.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.897
Uh-- Will there ever be a time

23:59.980 --> 24:02.733
you don't use my whole name like extended profanity?

24:04.568 --> 24:06.362
Just for shits and giggles,

24:06.444 --> 24:08.114
maybe one time, you can make an adult decision?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.740
Oh, you mean like calling an escort

24:09.823 --> 24:11.742
because your sex life's a snore?

24:11.825 --> 24:14.536
Or smoking pot with your 14

24:11.825 --> 24:14.536
Oh, God.

24:14.620 --> 24:18.082
Yeah, and now we're playing this big ruse

24:18.165 --> 24:19.457
that I'm their white-trash surrogate

24:19.541 --> 24:21.419
so I can stay while her parents visit.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.587
First, she's a hooker,

24:23.670 --> 24:26.632
then she's their niece, then she's their sugar baby,

24:26.715 --> 24:29.009
and now she's the baby mama?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.762
You guys are fucking loony, man.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.765
Okay, you little shit.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.809
Now you've narced me out and called me a hooker,

24:36.892 --> 24:38.352
so I'm gonna give you an ass beating

24:38.436 --> 24:40.813
your mom should've given you a long time ago.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.398
Big threats from such a little chick.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.649
-I'm not so little! -Let's do this thing.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.318
-I'm ready. -I'm gonna end you.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.820
You want to go? I'm ready to go.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.820
You think you're so tough?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.659
Caleb: I feel so comfortable with you two already.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.329
Oh, come on, Caleb.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.329
That is not okay.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.289
Janis: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.416
Dave go home.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.835
Shh.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.212
Ahhh.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.007
Stop. Stop.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.133
Stop!

25:11.177 --> 25:12.886
I hear something.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.181
Is that...

25:15.264 --> 25:16.432
It's Hal and Rita.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.351
Oh, God.
