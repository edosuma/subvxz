00:12.750 --> 00:14.041
All those in favor…

00:16.291 --> 00:17.625
All opposed.

00:20.666 --> 00:24.291
Well, the PTA has an accepted
set of rules concerning the prom.

00:24.375 --> 00:26.750
Young ladies must wear
non-revealing dresses.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.083
Young men must wear suits or tuxes.

00:29.166 --> 00:32.666
And if a student chooses to bring a date,
they must be of the opposite sex.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.916
Well, can't you just ban this student?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.125
Well, we've been advised
that there may be some legal repercussions

00:38.208 --> 00:40.166
if we prevent this girl from attending,

00:40.250 --> 00:42.833
so although it breaks my heart,
we have no choice.

00:42.916 --> 00:45.458
-There won't be a prom.
-[reporter 1] Mrs. Greene, a question.

00:45.541 --> 00:48.125
[reporter 2] Have you asked the students
what they think of this?

00:48.208 --> 00:50.000
[reporter 1]
Are you choosing not to comment?

00:50.083 --> 00:52.291
[reporter 2] Hey, there's Emma!
Can we get a comment?

00:52.375 --> 00:54.083
[reporter 3] Can you answer
some questions?

00:54.166 --> 00:55.625
[reporter 1] Can we get a statement?

00:55.708 --> 00:59.291
[reporter 2] Emma, what do you think
of the PTA's decision to cancel prom?

00:59.375 --> 01:01.083
[reporter 1] Emma, do you have a response?

01:46.875 --> 01:50.916
We're here for the opening night
of Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.166
starring the incomparable Dee Dee Allen.

01:54.250 --> 01:58.625
-Dee Dee! You're a Broadway star.
-Yes, I am. [chuckles]

01:58.708 --> 02:02.166
You have your choice of roles.
What drew you to Eleanor?

02:02.250 --> 02:07.250
Well, Eleanor Roosevelt
was a brave, powerful, charismatic woman

02:07.333 --> 02:09.250
who no one had ever heard of.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.958
Her story needs to be told.

02:11.041 --> 02:15.416
People need to know
it is possible to change the world,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.791
whether you're
a homely middle-aged First Lady

02:18.875 --> 02:21.250
or a Broadway star! [chuckles]

02:21.333 --> 02:24.458
Barry Glickman! You were brilliant as FDR.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.666
From the moment
I first stepped into FDR's shoes…

02:26.750 --> 02:28.916
And when I say "shoes," I mean wheelchair.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.083
…I had an epiphany.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.708
I realized there is no difference

02:32.791 --> 02:36.375
between the president of the United States
and a celebrity.

02:36.458 --> 02:40.583
We both have power.
The power to change the world.

-[Sheldon] Wow…
-What's happening?

05:16.833 --> 05:20.166
This is not a review you want
when you have crappy advance sales.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.875
This is gonna close us.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.041
What didn't they like? Was it the hip-hop?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.083
Yes, but not only that.

05:27.166 --> 05:30.833
-For God's sake, Sheldon. Just read it.
-What? Read.

05:30.916 --> 05:33.250
[Sheldon] Okay, just the highlights.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.208
"Barry Glickman's FDR might just be
the most insultingly misguided,

that this reviewer has ever had

That's not so bad.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.208
Well, that…

06:05.291 --> 06:07.916
That's not criticism.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.250
That's just… It's just a per…
[voice breaking] …a personal attack.

"If you're considering buying a ticket
to this show, do yourself a favor."

-[Dee Dee] Hmm.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.500
Honestly, Dee Dee, I feel adrift
as I did in my days before Juilliard.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.666
Oh, my God.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.875
You see, my passions are fueled
by the power of Lady Theater

07:35.958 --> 07:39.000
and how she can,
with a gentle touch of her hand,

07:39.083 --> 07:41.083
sculpt a human soul.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.833
-But we learned at Juilliard…
-Oh, mother of God.

07:43.916 --> 07:47.791
If I could soliloquize,
"If you prick me, do I not bleed?"

07:49.666 --> 07:52.541
"And if you do not pay me,
do I not still act?"

07:52.625 --> 07:54.208
That might be enough.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.000
Still, I have played Hamlet,

07:56.083 --> 08:01.875
and yet I'm only known as that guy
from the beloved early aughts' sitcom…

08:07.875 --> 08:10.791

the very meaning of my existence.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.916
[jazzy tune playing]

08:13.000 --> 08:17.125
Maggie Smith once approached me
in a men's bathroom and she said,

08:17.208 --> 08:19.791
"Who sent you? Was it Michelle Dockery?"

08:19.875 --> 08:23.708
"Because the court said 500 yards."
You could tell she was scared.

08:23.791 --> 08:26.958
-Hey, guys!
-[Barry] Angie! Angie.

08:27.041 --> 08:30.291

closed on opening night again!

08:32.416 --> 08:35.083
Welcome to the world
of the unemployed. Top me off.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.750
I thought you were in Chicago.

08:36.833 --> 08:39.583
[groans] I just quit.

08:40.208 --> 08:43.708
Twenty years in the chorus and they still
wouldn't let me play Roxie Hart.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.958
-[Dee Dee] Aw.
-You wanna know who's playing the role?

08:46.041 --> 08:47.416
-Kelly Ripa?
-Cher?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.166
-Connie Chung.
-Kris Jenner?

08:49.250 --> 08:50.833
No, Tina Louise.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.916
Ginger from Gilligan's Island.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.625
Oh, my God, is she still alive?

[laughs]

09:04.416 --> 09:05.625
[sighs]

09:09.916 --> 09:12.250
We're wasting our lives.

09:12.333 --> 09:16.250
Hmm, it's true.
At least we're all in the same boat.

09:16.333 --> 09:20.416
"Misery acquaints a man
with strange bedfellows."

09:20.500 --> 09:22.583

-That's from The Tempest.

09:22.666 --> 09:26.541
Okay, one, shut up.
Two, I refuse to give up, okay?

09:26.625 --> 09:30.458
We're… We're still celebrities.
We still have power.

09:30.541 --> 09:31.666
[chuckles]

09:31.750 --> 09:34.166
Now, The Times
sort of castrated you as it were.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.083
[Barry sighs]

09:35.166 --> 09:38.416
Yep. They wrote you off
as aging narcissists.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.375
I still don't understand
what's wrong with that.

09:41.458 --> 09:45.625
There's a very simple way
that we can still love ourselves

09:45.708 --> 09:50.500
yet appear to be
decent human beings, okay?

09:50.583 --> 09:53.166
We will become celebrity activists.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.500
-[Angie] Oh! Brilliant!
-[Barry] Right?

09:55.583 --> 09:57.875
-All we need is a cause.
-A cause célèbre.

09:57.958 --> 10:00.375
Everybody think of some causes. Go.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.416
-Um, poverty?
-Too big.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.750
World hunger.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.625
That is also a major thing.
No, we need something we can handle.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.166
Some little injustice
we can drive to. Recycling.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.541
-Let's see what's trending.
-[Barry] Recycling's good.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.833
-Why are there so many award shows?
-Parking.

10:16.916 --> 10:20.000
-[Barry] Or the TVs in the back of cabs.
-Oh! Oh, yeah, what about this girl?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.750
Oh, my gosh. Check this out.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.541
-[Barry] What girl?
-It's all over Twitter.

10:24.625 --> 10:25.458
[Barry] Oh.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.166
She's from Edgewater, Indiana.

10:29.166 --> 10:33.291
She's a lesbian. She wanted to take
her girlfriend to the high school prom,

10:33.375 --> 10:35.958
and the PTA went apeshit
and they canceled it.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.000
They canceled prom?

10:38.083 --> 10:40.125
-Are they allowed to do that?
-No.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.125
[reporter] Principal Hawkins,
your response.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.000
The first thing I'm going to do
is contact the Indiana state's attorney.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.416
This is not about school rules.
This is a civil rights case.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.583
Wait, seriously?

10:49.666 --> 10:53.458
I'm betting pressure from the state's
attorney will stop these bigots cold.

10:53.541 --> 10:55.541
It better.
Because I'll tell you this much.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.000
If word gets out,
people are gonna get mad.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.375
This pisses me off.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.500
The next thing you know,
some modern-day Eleanor Roosevelt

11:02.583 --> 11:05.375
is gonna march down here
and all hell's gonna break loose.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.791
We have got to go down there
and raise holy hell.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.333
We will be the biggest thing
to happen in Indiana

11:12.416 --> 11:14.625
since… whatever's happened in Indiana.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.708
-So this is it? This is our cause?
-Yes. Are you with me?

11:17.791 --> 11:19.541
[all cheer]

11:19.625 --> 11:21.166
-We'll have a rally!
-Yes!

11:21.250 --> 11:24.375
-We'll have picket signs!
-We'll make T-shirts.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.666
We'll get Sheldon to tag along.
He can find us a venue.

Tony Award winner, Miss Dee Dee Allen.

36:43.625 --> 36:47.000
-Trent, I could rip your face off.
-I'm sorry.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.833
[Barry] You made me fail.
I am so sick of failing.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.250
What do we do now?

36:51.333 --> 36:52.375
We leave.

36:52.958 --> 36:56.291
-First we kill Trent, then we leave.
-What about the girl?

36:56.375 --> 36:58.583
-[Dee Dee sighs]
-[Principal Hawkins] Hello, everyone…

36:59.791 --> 37:03.458
We have some news. Emma and I
wanted to be the ones to tell you,

37:03.541 --> 37:07.750
thanks to pressure from the state's
attorney's office, prom is back on!

37:07.833 --> 37:09.708
-[Barry] What?
-Prom is back on! [squeals]

37:09.791 --> 37:11.666
-[all cheering]
-We did it!

37:11.750 --> 37:12.625
Yay!

37:12.708 --> 37:16.041
See? We're not narcissists.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.416
Just to be clear, uh,
it's not because of you…

37:18.500 --> 37:19.708
Well, maybe it was.

37:19.791 --> 37:23.000
I mean, everybody started freaking out
when you got here.

37:23.083 --> 37:26.791
The lawyer might've had legal power,
but you really scared people.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.208
-[Angie] Aw!
-We scared people!

37:28.291 --> 37:29.958
Important thing is, it's a victory.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.916
Now you get to go to prom
like everybody else!

37:32.000 --> 37:34.125
-[Angie] Yes!
-What are you gonna wear?

37:34.208 --> 37:38.041
I was thinking like a vintage tux
and some high tops.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.083
I don't know. Does it matter?

37:41.750 --> 37:42.750
-Does it…
-[scoffs]

37:43.541 --> 37:44.875
[snickers]

37:45.875 --> 37:49.166
-Honey…
-Sweetheart, boo-boo.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.625
I don't know you, okay?
And you don't know me,

37:51.708 --> 37:56.083
but I am begging you,
let me dress you for the prom.

37:56.166 --> 37:57.750
-Okay? Yeah?
-Okay.

37:57.833 --> 37:59.625
We're going to Saks.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.166
-Uh, there's no Saks here.
-We have a Kmart!

38:02.250 --> 38:03.958
-A what?
-A Kmart.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.208
-[laughs]
-[Barry] Fine.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.791
We'll check out
the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart,

38:11.875 --> 38:12.916
do a little fashion show.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.625
Okay! Oh, can we do it tomorrow?
We can meet at my place.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.875
I have to go and find out
if I still have a date.

38:18.958 --> 38:20.875
Sure. I'll go ahead, do a pre-shop.

38:20.958 --> 38:23.458
Okay? Will you give me a ride
in your pickup truck?

38:23.541 --> 38:26.166
Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian,
I drive a pickup?

38:26.250 --> 38:28.708
-Well, do you? [chuckles]
-Shut up.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.791
-[Sheldon] Anybody hungry?
-[Angie] I could drink.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.916
-[Sheldon] What's around here?
-I saw a Big Boy by the highway.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.208
-[Sheldon] Ooh, they have a gay bar here?
-[Angie] I love Big Boy.

38:37.291 --> 38:40.625
Oh, gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.208
-Oh! Of course.
-[both chuckle]

38:46.541 --> 38:49.166
-So, it's nice to see Emma smile again.
-Yes.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.875
She's had a rough go of it.

38:50.958 --> 38:53.416
I gathered that. Yeah.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.166
-Even before the prom controversy.
-Oh?

38:56.250 --> 39:00.375
When she came out, her parents,
well, they threw her out of the house.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.916
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.

39:05.541 --> 39:07.458
-It was, uh, pretty ugly.
-Oh…

39:10.333 --> 39:12.000
Anyway, um…

39:12.916 --> 39:14.458
thank you for helping her…

39:15.625 --> 39:18.166
-Or trying to.
-[both chuckle softly]

39:18.958 --> 39:20.125
[Dee Dee] Yeah…

39:23.833 --> 39:25.791
-Uh, Tom?
-Yes, yeah?

39:26.583 --> 39:31.000
Is there a restaurant in town
that has plates and cutlery and…

39:31.083 --> 39:33.833
Oh, uh, there's an Applebee's by the mall.

39:33.916 --> 39:34.750
[gasps]

39:37.583 --> 39:39.000
-Would you like to go?
-Yes.

39:39.083 --> 39:42.666
Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.

39:42.750 --> 39:43.666
-[giggles]
-All right.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.416
-Thank you.

-I see as many Broadway shows as I can.
-Oh.

I second act them.

-Don't tell anybody.

I've seen you many, many times.

Oh.

42:46.291 --> 42:47.916
Mr. Hawkins.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.291
Mrs. Greene.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.041
Hello. I'm Dee Dee Allen.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.875
-We haven't officially met.
-No.

42:53.958 --> 42:56.250
-Hello. Dee Dee Allen.
-We're aware.

42:57.833 --> 43:03.083
Ms. Allen, I'm sure that you are
very well-versed in the ways of the world

43:03.166 --> 43:06.125
and Broadway in particular.
That's a community.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
But you don't know us.
You don't know this town and our values.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.625
No, well, I'm just here
advocating on behalf of a young girl

43:15.708 --> 43:20.333
whose voice perhaps is not heard
by some in the community.

43:20.916 --> 43:26.458
Yes. Well, perhaps you should stick
to acting instead of activism.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.708
Enjoy your meal.

to make anything worse here.

I appreciate everything that you're doing.

43:40.583 --> 43:42.125
Well, let's just drop it.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.041
Yeah.

43:43.875 --> 43:45.458
Tell me… [chuckles softly]

43:46.083 --> 43:48.333
I've never said this before to anyone.

43:49.375 --> 43:50.791
Tell me about you.

43:52.125 --> 43:54.000
-About me?
-Yeah.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.958
I don't know.
I'm just a small-town principal.

43:59.833 --> 44:05.083
Uh, you know, it can be frustrating,
but, uh, at least I have a job.

44:05.166 --> 44:06.458
Yeah, lucky you.

44:06.541 --> 44:07.416
Single.

44:08.708 --> 44:09.541
Sorry?

44:10.250 --> 44:12.500
I'm single. Just putting that out there.

44:13.083 --> 44:14.833
Really? [giggles]

44:16.416 --> 44:18.625
I'm surprised.

44:18.708 --> 44:21.000
Oh, well, I'm surprised you're surprised.

44:21.083 --> 44:23.625
[chuckles] The two things
I'm most passionate about in the world

44:23.708 --> 44:26.291
are Broadway musicals
and secondary school administration.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.291
Oh.

44:27.375 --> 44:31.958
I typed that into a dating website once,
and a little message popped up that said,

44:32.041 --> 44:34.125
"You will have zero matches forever."

44:43.041 --> 44:44.125
[clears throat] Thank you.

44:54.375 --> 44:57.250
I wasn't born on Broadway. You know?

44:58.333 --> 45:00.625
I'm from Zelienople, Pennsylvania.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.333
Yeah, I grew up dirt poor.

45:09.041 --> 45:11.583
All this, I invented it.

45:12.166 --> 45:15.291
Yeah. I'm just a small-town girl and…

45:17.125 --> 45:19.000
-I had a big dream.
-Hmm.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.041
Single, just putting it out there.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.333
Well, I'm divorced.

Eddie Sharpe, the talk show host?

45:33.291 --> 45:34.958
Yeah, right.

45:35.041 --> 45:39.125
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing years.

45:42.291 --> 45:46.375

Dee Dee Allen, being a Broadway star.

45:46.458 --> 45:49.041
You know, it is hard.

45:50.625 --> 45:53.000
Sometimes I think I really…
I just want to quit.

No. No, please, you can't--
You can't do that.

49:00.875 --> 49:04.250
you know, she needed proof
she was still part of the family,

49:04.333 --> 49:07.750
and nothing says family
like a Sears family portrait.

49:08.583 --> 49:11.458
-Is there booze in this?
-There sure is.

49:11.541 --> 49:14.500
-[coughs] When you said lemonade…
-Well, it's Indiana lemonade.

49:14.583 --> 49:18.541
Okay, it's official. I love you.
You're the cool grandmother I never had.

49:19.375 --> 49:23.041
Hey, let me ask you something.
What happened with Emma?

49:24.166 --> 49:25.250
[sighs]

49:25.750 --> 49:27.833
You're not a mother,
so you can't know what it's like

49:27.916 --> 49:30.375
to see your own daughter
give up her child.

49:30.458 --> 49:31.791
I'm sorry.

49:31.875 --> 49:36.000
When Emma came out,
oh, they could not handle it.

49:39.041 --> 49:41.625
To bad parents and their broken progeny.

49:42.875 --> 49:45.708
Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid.

49:45.791 --> 49:46.625
[Barry] Mmm.

49:47.208 --> 49:48.958
Oh, I wasn't talking about her.

49:50.625 --> 49:52.875
What? You got kicked out too?

49:53.708 --> 49:56.125
Well, I left before they could do that.

49:59.166 --> 50:02.708
[Emma] So the only
nice dress I have is this.

50:02.791 --> 50:03.666
Wow.

50:04.666 --> 50:08.375
Okay, I mean, yeah, yep,
you could wear that to prom

50:08.458 --> 50:09.583
or keep it lying around

50:09.666 --> 50:12.083
in case there's a remake of
Little House on the Prairie.

50:12.166 --> 50:14.875
Okay. That's it. I like him.

50:14.958 --> 50:17.458
Emma, please let me
dress you for this prom.

50:17.541 --> 50:22.500
I don't know. This is all so crazy.
What did you wear to your prom?

50:22.583 --> 50:25.916
Well, I was going to wear a silver tux,

50:26.541 --> 50:29.333
aqua accessories, the whole look.

50:29.416 --> 50:32.500
I waited outside, anxious to see my crush,

50:32.583 --> 50:35.333
but when I saw him with his date, I froze.

50:36.083 --> 50:37.416
I couldn't go in.

50:38.291 --> 50:40.291
I didn't have your courage.

50:41.291 --> 50:42.666
This isn't about me.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.041
This is about you.

50:45.125 --> 50:48.625
And I promise you are going
to have the night of your life.

50:49.166 --> 50:50.500
What is your date wearing?

50:51.750 --> 50:52.750
I don't know.

50:54.333 --> 50:56.583
I've never been to her house before.

50:57.291 --> 50:58.916
Her mom doesn't know about us.

50:59.625 --> 51:01.083
How long have you been together?

51:01.916 --> 51:03.541
-A year and a half.
-Oh, honey.

51:03.625 --> 51:07.250
But she's coming out tonight, big time.
That's the plan.

51:09.208 --> 51:10.583
I'm really scared.

51:11.750 --> 51:13.166
Would you get over here?

51:13.916 --> 51:17.708
The point is you are brave.

51:17.791 --> 51:19.875
You made all this happen.

51:19.958 --> 51:23.041
When you walk into that gym tonight,
you know what people are gonna see?

51:23.125 --> 51:25.875
They're going to see
the bravest person on the planet.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.625
This is so hard.
Does every girl go through this?

51:29.708 --> 51:31.625
Yes, all across town,

51:31.708 --> 51:35.125
girls are spraying on their tans
and whitening their teeth,

51:35.208 --> 51:38.791
trying to look their best for the prom,
but they're wasting their time

51:38.875 --> 51:42.500
because they don't have the glow
that you have right now.

51:43.916 --> 51:47.375
I trust you completely,
and that's kind of scary too.

51:47.458 --> 51:50.041
Can we please go shop? Can we mall it?

51:50.791 --> 51:53.708
-Is that okay?
-Yes, mall the hell out of it!

51:53.791 --> 51:55.333
-Let's go.
-Okay!

51:55.416 --> 51:57.708

they had to hold an inclusive prom.

Please, just stop helping me.

1:01:48.625 --> 1:01:50.458
Emma! Emma!

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:55.625
This is a complete disaster.

1:01:55.708 --> 1:01:57.500
[Sheldon] This is a PR problem.

1:01:57.583 --> 1:02:02.541
No, Sheldon.
We had a PR problem back in New York.

1:02:03.250 --> 1:02:05.208
This was supposed to solve that.

1:02:06.208 --> 1:02:07.250
But this…

1:02:08.166 --> 1:02:10.541
This is heartbreaking.

1:02:10.625 --> 1:02:14.833
This is why you came here? For publicity?

1:02:23.916 --> 1:02:25.083
[sniffles]

1:02:31.750 --> 1:02:32.833
[indistinct chatter]

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:35.375
[Mrs. Greene] I have been asked
to read a statement.

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:40.125
"What happened here
was not the result of some elaborate plan

1:02:40.208 --> 1:02:44.708
to humiliate this girl,
as has been reported in the press."

1:02:44.791 --> 1:02:48.375
"The James Madison High School
Parent-Teacher Association

1:02:48.458 --> 1:02:51.333
felt Emma would not be safe

1:02:51.416 --> 1:02:54.750
if we allowed her
to attend prom with the other students

1:02:54.833 --> 1:02:57.166
because the uncomfortable truth

1:02:57.250 --> 1:03:03.041
is there are people in our community
who are offended by her life choices."

1:03:04.166 --> 1:03:08.083
I can't even wrap my head around this.
It's a nightmare. Oh, my God!

1:03:09.416 --> 1:03:11.750
I wanna be the cockeyed optimist here

1:03:11.833 --> 1:03:14.166
'cause I played Nellie Forbush
in South Pacific.

1:03:14.250 --> 1:03:16.458
It was a dinner theater production, but…

1:03:16.541 --> 1:03:17.375
Ugh.

1:03:19.041 --> 1:03:21.416
This is horrible. It really is.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.916
Thanks for hanging out with me
these past couple of days.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.375
You've been a good friend.

1:03:27.041 --> 1:03:31.291
-I have?
-You have. You seem surprised.

1:03:31.375 --> 1:03:33.000
No, I just…

1:03:34.458 --> 1:03:37.375
I'm a chorus girl. You know, I just…

1:03:38.208 --> 1:03:39.041
[sighs]

1:03:39.708 --> 1:03:43.041
No one ever thanks me.
They don't even see me.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:47.875
Spend my whole life
trying to stay in the game,

1:03:49.541 --> 1:03:51.375
and keep my day-drinking under control.

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:52.291
[snickers]

1:03:52.958 --> 1:03:55.166
That's really nice. Thanks, kid.

1:03:57.583 --> 1:04:01.375
Hey, you're going to get through this.
I know it.

1:04:02.166 --> 1:04:03.333
[inhales shakily]

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:08.125
I thought that when my parents
rejected me and stopped loving me

1:04:08.208 --> 1:04:10.291
that I would never feel any worse,
you know?

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:11.833
Mmm-hmm.

1:04:11.916 --> 1:04:13.416
And now this…

1:04:15.250 --> 1:04:16.458
And I feel worse.

1:04:16.541 --> 1:04:19.875
-Honey…
-I've never felt so alone in my life.

1:04:19.958 --> 1:04:23.208
But you're not alone. You're not.

1:04:23.291 --> 1:04:25.041
You got me. Hmm?

1:04:25.625 --> 1:04:29.666
And we are ride-or-die,
and you do have friends.

1:04:30.666 --> 1:04:31.708
Where are they?

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:39.291
-[Dee Dee] This is it.
-[Trent] Yes.

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:40.750
-No.
-Well, okay.

1:04:43.791 --> 1:04:44.916
[knocking on door]

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:47.875
-[doorbell rings]
-[knocking at door]

1:04:47.958 --> 1:04:50.125
-Emma, can we come in?
-Yes.

1:04:50.208 --> 1:04:52.708
-We brought Häagen-Dazs.
-[Trent] That's fancy ice cream.

1:04:52.791 --> 1:04:55.666
I know what Häagen-Dazs is. Hand it over.

1:04:55.750 --> 1:04:58.500
Emma, I know you said
you didn't want us to help anymore,

1:04:58.583 --> 1:05:02.291
but we cannot let them get away with this.
We have got to fight back.

1:05:02.375 --> 1:05:04.583
Okay, I know everybody's really angry.

1:05:05.625 --> 1:05:09.083
But I think we have to admit
that we have made things worse.

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:13.666
I think the best thing we can do
is disinfect our things and go back home.

1:05:13.750 --> 1:05:15.500
-No, we are not leaving.
-No!

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:19.958
Dee Dee, we are gonna stay here,
and we're going to turn this thing around.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:22.250
-We gotta take back the press.
-[Trent] Yes, how?

1:05:22.333 --> 1:05:26.000
Emma, you've got to step up
and be the face of this thing.

1:05:26.083 --> 1:05:27.750
And that's going to get her a prom?

1:05:27.833 --> 1:05:31.541
This is not about a prom anymore.
This is about right and wrong.

1:05:31.625 --> 1:05:34.375
We need a national audience, prime time.

1:05:34.458 --> 1:05:37.500
You want a big audience fast?
We gotta use our ace in the hole.

1:05:38.875 --> 1:05:41.125
-One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need.
-No. No.

1:05:41.208 --> 1:05:42.416
-[Trent] Dee Dee!
-He's right.

1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:45.541
If I ask him for something,
he will want something in return,

1:05:45.625 --> 1:05:47.375
and what he will want
is the Hamptons house.

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:48.958
He's been trying to get it for years.

1:05:49.833 --> 1:05:53.541
Okay. Okay, fine. Look, Sheldon,
you got to get that girl on TV.

1:05:53.625 --> 1:05:55.000
-Okay.
-Great.

1:05:55.083 --> 1:05:57.000
No, not great.

1:05:57.083 --> 1:06:00.333
I'm sorry, but there is no way
I'm getting in front of a camera

1:06:00.416 --> 1:06:03.375
and telling my story
to millions of people. I can't do that.

1:06:03.458 --> 1:06:07.500
-See?
-Please. Please, just go.

1:06:08.458 --> 1:06:11.875
-Emma, if you do nothing-- Okay.
-Barry. Go.

1:06:13.541 --> 1:06:17.166
-Okay, I get it. Okay. Okay.
-[Angie] Go. Go, go, go. Go, go.

1:06:17.250 --> 1:06:19.291
[whispering] I got this.
I know what I'm doing.

1:06:20.833 --> 1:06:22.041
Let me do my thing.

1:06:24.041 --> 1:06:26.958
There must be a way to rid this community,
and by extension, the nation,

1:06:27.041 --> 1:06:28.500
of this cancer of intolerance.

1:06:28.583 --> 1:06:30.875
What are you even doing here?
What happened to Godspell?

1:06:30.958 --> 1:06:34.333
Indianapolis was canceled,
as was the naval base at Guantánamo Bay.

1:06:34.416 --> 1:06:36.208
What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this.

1:06:36.291 --> 1:06:39.541
Venture forth and seek out
the young people and rap,

1:06:39.625 --> 1:06:41.041
in a non-musical sense.

1:06:49.583 --> 1:06:50.416
[Angie] Mmm.

1:06:55.250 --> 1:06:56.750
Let's go get some more, huh?

1:06:57.583 --> 1:06:58.833
Two spoons this time.

1:06:59.916 --> 1:07:00.916
Come on.

1:07:04.250 --> 1:07:06.166
[Angie] Gotta stop. [chuckling]

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:11.791
Before you lecture me or kick me to death
with those crazy antelope legs of yours,

1:07:11.875 --> 1:07:15.583
or whatever you're gonna do,
I know I should do something.

1:07:16.958 --> 1:07:18.500
I just can't.

1:07:18.583 --> 1:07:20.125
You gotta do this.

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:22.083
You gotta do it for all of us people

1:07:22.166 --> 1:07:25.791
that are standing in the wings,
waiting to go on.

1:07:27.083 --> 1:07:29.500
-I'm too scared.
-Hmm.

1:07:31.666 --> 1:07:33.083
Let me tell you a story.

1:07:34.083 --> 1:07:36.750
It's 1975

1:07:36.833 --> 1:07:40.041
and the original company of Chicago
is in previews,

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:43.041
and the worst flu in history
hits the cast.

1:07:43.125 --> 1:07:47.291
They're down to the third cover
for the role of Roxie Hart

1:07:47.375 --> 1:07:50.291
and she's scared, just like you are.

1:07:50.375 --> 1:07:56.666
And Fosse, who is a real ballbuster,
is putting her through her paces

1:07:56.750 --> 1:07:58.458
and she's petrified.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:08:01.166
Worst of all, she's doing the routine
like she's a robot.

1:08:01.250 --> 1:08:07.625
So the Foss, he says,
"Hey, kid. Snap out of it."

1:08:08.125 --> 1:08:09.583
[jazz music playing]

1:08:09.666 --> 1:08:11.875
"You got the steps."

1:08:11.958 --> 1:08:14.250
"You've got the notes."

1:08:15.416 --> 1:08:18.833
"Where's the zazz, baby?"

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:23.666
And even though
she'd never heard that word before,

1:08:23.750 --> 1:08:26.041
she knew immediately what it meant.

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:29.375
And she went out there
and she found that spotlight,

1:08:29.458 --> 1:08:32.250
and she crushed that performance so hard,

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:39.125
she had that whole audience standing
on their feet screaming bloody murder!

1:08:39.208 --> 1:08:40.041
[sighs]

1:08:40.791 --> 1:08:42.250
And that girl was you!

1:08:43.125 --> 1:08:44.125
What?

1:08:44.875 --> 1:08:46.375
How old do you think I am?

1:08:46.458 --> 1:08:50.666
It was 1975! No.

1:08:50.750 --> 1:08:56.541
The point is
every Fosse girl knows that story.

1:08:56.625 --> 1:09:00.625

-Sheldon is on it. Come on.

1:12:26.750 --> 1:12:29.458
-How does this work, anyway?
-[Barry] It's infrared.

-It reduces inflammation.
-[Dee Dee] Oh, good.

But you can't keep it on too long.
It'll blow your face off.

Well, I took him out. [chuckles]

1:13:04.958 --> 1:13:06.250
He didn't have any money.

1:13:06.333 --> 1:13:11.416
He was just starting out in comedy,
and he didn't have the big show like now.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:15.291
Fifteen years, he didn't have any money.

1:13:31.208 --> 1:13:36.333
[sighs] Is it a pleasant observation
or is it an irritating one?

1:13:36.416 --> 1:13:37.625
You're not over him.

1:13:37.708 --> 1:13:39.500
No, don't say that. I am not…

1:13:39.583 --> 1:13:41.750
Trust me. I am…

1:13:41.833 --> 1:13:44.041
[chuckling] I am way over him.

1:13:44.125 --> 1:13:47.875
I'm just mad at myself, you know, I am so…

1:13:48.583 --> 1:13:50.666
Why it took me so long to…

1:13:51.958 --> 1:13:53.166
figure it out.

1:13:53.958 --> 1:13:58.000
You know? I believed him.
I believed him every single time.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.083
"I promise you, it's nothing."

1:14:01.166 --> 1:14:03.916
"It's meaningless.
She's nothing to me. It's over."

1:14:05.333 --> 1:14:08.541
I finally got the message, you know.
He didn't love me. [chuckles]

1:14:10.750 --> 1:14:11.750
He didn't…

1:14:12.666 --> 1:14:14.791
[chuckling] He didn't even like me.

1:14:16.666 --> 1:14:18.041
But he liked the money.

1:14:18.833 --> 1:14:21.625
Oh, yeah, so I got out.

1:14:23.375 --> 1:14:24.375
I got out…

1:14:25.541 --> 1:14:27.416
and I gave him half my money.

1:14:28.750 --> 1:14:31.916
And now here we are, singing to trucks.

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000
-And he's got a hit TV show.
-[audience cheering]

1:14:34.083 --> 1:14:36.708
And I still owe him
half my unemployment check.

1:14:36.791 --> 1:14:38.791
[announcer on TV] It's Eddie Sharpe!

1:14:38.875 --> 1:14:40.125
[Eddie] Whoa, hey!

1:14:40.208 --> 1:14:43.291
Welcome, everybody!
What's today's words of wisdom?

1:14:43.375 --> 1:14:45.875
[Eddie and audience] Never sign a prenup!

1:14:45.958 --> 1:14:47.666
[all laughing through TV]

1:14:50.708 --> 1:14:53.291
And you know what the worst part is?

1:14:55.083 --> 1:14:56.000
I shut down.

1:14:58.208 --> 1:15:03.250
He took my little,
delicate blueberry heart,

1:15:03.333 --> 1:15:05.916
and he just… squished it.

1:15:07.666 --> 1:15:08.500
[Dee Dee sniffles]

1:15:10.541 --> 1:15:13.375
-What?
-Here's what you're gonna do, okay?

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:18.041
You're gonna wear something
heart-stopping, like that yellow cape

1:15:18.125 --> 1:15:19.750
and those cute little boots.

1:15:19.833 --> 1:15:21.583
And you are gonna march down

1:15:21.666 --> 1:15:25.583
to that principal's office
like a bad, bad girl.

1:15:25.666 --> 1:15:27.333
[chuckling] Tom?

1:15:27.416 --> 1:15:29.791
-Tom is a fan. Friend.
-[Barry] Hmm?

1:15:29.875 --> 1:15:31.041
Well…

1:15:32.250 --> 1:15:33.375
he likes you.

1:15:34.541 --> 1:15:36.250
As a fan. Friend.

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:40.083
I don't know.
Not even that much anymore.

1:15:40.166 --> 1:15:42.583
Okay, let's cut the crap.
I would kill, kill,

1:15:42.666 --> 1:15:45.416
to have a guy look at me
the way that he looks at you.

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:47.500
Stop it.

1:15:48.416 --> 1:15:52.666
You're just…
You're poking my heart with your finger.

1:15:53.375 --> 1:15:56.416
Your still-beating,
delicate little blueberry heart?

1:16:02.250 --> 1:16:05.916
Do you think he really, really likes me?

1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:07.083
Oh, my God, yes!

1:16:08.083 --> 1:16:09.416
Barry! [kisses]

1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:11.125
[laughing]

1:16:11.208 --> 1:16:14.166
-I love you! I love you!
-I love you! I love you!

1:16:14.250 --> 1:16:16.541
You're just such a great… everything.

1:16:16.625 --> 1:16:18.333
[laughing]

1:16:19.125 --> 1:16:21.083
[Dee Dee] Okay, no, no, no. Okay.

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.083
This, the master stroke, your idea.

1:16:24.166 --> 1:16:26.625
-And the boots?
-And the little cute boots.

1:16:26.708 --> 1:16:27.666
[chuckling]

1:16:28.666 --> 1:16:29.833
This is it.

1:16:31.708 --> 1:16:32.708
Oh!

1:16:33.541 --> 1:16:35.458
That is good.

1:16:39.833 --> 1:16:41.875
Mmm, now…

1:16:42.833 --> 1:16:43.666
you.

1:16:46.458 --> 1:16:48.791
I've been thinking about you
since we got here.

1:16:48.875 --> 1:16:51.791
Oh, God. I knew this was gonna
somehow turn around to me.

1:16:51.875 --> 1:16:57.250
And I think it's time somebody poked
that gay little heart of yours.

1:16:57.333 --> 1:16:59.250
Are we doing this? Fine. Uh…

1:16:59.333 --> 1:17:02.666
Do I only go for 10s
when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and--

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:06.083
Your parents. You're from Ohio, right?

1:17:06.166 --> 1:17:07.416
So?

1:17:08.291 --> 1:17:09.666
We're in Indiana.

1:17:09.750 --> 1:17:13.500
-Ohio, Indiana, they're close.
-I can see where you're driving this.

1:17:13.583 --> 1:17:15.958
You have two living parents

1:17:16.041 --> 1:17:19.291
that you'll never be nearer to
than you are right now.

1:17:19.375 --> 1:17:22.166
-I think you should call them.
-No.

1:17:23.041 --> 1:17:24.416
They threw me away.

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:26.750
Well, did they really?

1:17:26.833 --> 1:17:28.250
I told them that I was gay,

1:17:28.333 --> 1:17:32.166
and they said that they would take me
to therapy to change myself completely.

1:17:34.208 --> 1:17:37.875
Let your parents see who you are
before it's too late.

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:41.708
If you don't…

1:17:42.750 --> 1:17:43.750
you'll regret it.

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:48.250
I'm not the one who should have regrets.

1:17:50.291 --> 1:17:51.875
[voice breaking] I was the kid.

1:17:52.958 --> 1:17:54.208
I was the kid!

1:17:56.375 --> 1:17:57.958
[crying] I was 16.

1:18:00.500 --> 1:18:03.458
Sixteen years old. I was terrified.

1:18:03.541 --> 1:18:05.000
Terrified!

1:18:08.125 --> 1:18:11.166
And I needed one thing from them
and they couldn't give it to me.

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:12.125
So don't you…

1:18:13.708 --> 1:18:14.791
[sobbing]

1:18:30.291 --> 1:18:31.875
[school bell ringing]

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:35.458
[woman over PA]
Would the following students

1:18:35.541 --> 1:18:37.583
please report to after-school detention?

1:18:38.458 --> 1:18:39.416
Harlan Doolittle…

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:40.333
Hi.

1:18:40.416 --> 1:18:42.875
…Olivia Blanc, Frances Doolittle.
Thank you.

1:18:43.958 --> 1:18:45.875
[Principal Hawkins]
Well, they each had a bite.

1:18:45.958 --> 1:18:48.791
-Ooh, what'd you do?
-[Principal Hawkins] Yeah, a big bite.

1:18:48.875 --> 1:18:50.875
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.

1:18:52.375 --> 1:18:53.583
[Dee Dee chuckles softly]

1:18:54.166 --> 1:18:56.083
Am I interrupting something?

1:18:56.166 --> 1:18:58.041
I was just doing some research,

1:18:58.125 --> 1:19:01.333
trying to figure out
if urinal cakes are poisonous.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.125
-Uh, how can I help you?
-[chuckles softly]

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:09.750
Well, I've just been wandering
around town all day.

1:19:09.833 --> 1:19:11.250
[chuckles]

1:19:11.833 --> 1:19:15.125
I've seen the… sight. [chuckles softly]

1:19:15.708 --> 1:19:16.708
And, um…

1:19:18.458 --> 1:19:23.125
Bottom line is I just thought
you might want to take me to dinner

1:19:23.208 --> 1:19:26.041
and worship me again. [chuckles]

1:19:26.125 --> 1:19:27.750
No, I would not like to do that.

1:19:27.833 --> 1:19:30.291
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

1:19:30.375 --> 1:19:33.625
Okay, what's going on here?
Why is everybody always so mad at me?

1:19:33.708 --> 1:19:37.583
Well, speaking for myself,
it's because you're an opportunist.

1:19:37.666 --> 1:19:40.583
You came here for publicity.
You're a terrible person.

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:43.041
No, no. Nobody gets to
talk to me that way. Nobody!

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.000
You know, meeting you in person
has been colossally disappointing.

1:19:47.083 --> 1:19:48.208
[scoffs]

1:19:48.291 --> 1:19:50.083
I wanted you to be Dolores.

1:19:50.166 --> 1:19:51.833
Who the hell is Dolores?

1:19:51.916 --> 1:19:53.708
From Swallow the Moon.

1:19:53.791 --> 1:19:54.750
[audience applauding]

1:19:54.833 --> 1:19:58.541
[Principal Hawkins] She was joyful.
She was full of courage and hope.

1:19:58.625 --> 1:20:01.625
-Okay, but she was fictional.
-But you made her real.

1:20:03.250 --> 1:20:05.833
When you sang
"The Lady's Improving" to Troy Gibson,

1:20:05.916 --> 1:20:09.125
you were admitting you weren't perfect
and you knew you could be better,

1:20:09.208 --> 1:20:11.875
and that's why
he didn't fire you from the circus act.

1:20:13.333 --> 1:20:15.791
Such humility and dignity.

1:20:16.458 --> 1:20:18.916
-That's who I thought you were.
-Well, I'm not.

1:20:19.916 --> 1:20:21.541
I'm not Dolores.

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:28.041
I'm just a really, really,
really good actress. And you…

1:20:28.666 --> 1:20:30.916
You're just some hick town
high school teacher

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.541
who can't even tell the difference
between fantasy and reality.

1:20:34.625 --> 1:20:36.500
-Are we done?
-Oh, yeah, we're done.

See? See?

1:23:26.125 --> 1:23:31.125
I'm not a total lost cause.
That was a totally selfless act.

1:23:31.208 --> 1:23:34.166
I mean, people would pay
premium prices for that performance.

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:36.750
[sighs] All right, you guys are dismissed.

1:23:36.833 --> 1:23:40.958
Dee Dee, not charging for an apology
is not a selfless act.

1:23:42.083 --> 1:23:43.083
What the hell?

1:23:43.166 --> 1:23:47.125
If you want people to like you
instead of hate you, you have to be good.

1:23:47.208 --> 1:23:51.291
A good person. You have to put
other people's interests before your own.

1:23:52.208 --> 1:23:55.375
[scoffs] You don't understand.
I am a celebrity.

1:23:55.458 --> 1:23:58.958
It is all about me.
It has been for decades. [chuckling]

1:23:59.833 --> 1:24:03.833
That's the point of celebrity.
So I have to be reprogrammed.

1:24:03.916 --> 1:24:07.583
I have to unlearn things
like shoving and taking.

1:24:07.666 --> 1:24:08.750
-You know…
-Yes.

1:24:08.833 --> 1:24:11.000
I need help with that. I need a…

1:24:12.458 --> 1:24:13.458

Please.

1:24:51.166 --> 1:24:52.166
Hi.

1:24:53.041 --> 1:24:55.333
Thanks for meeting me.
I was afraid you wouldn't come--

1:24:55.416 --> 1:24:56.250
What do you want?

1:24:56.333 --> 1:24:59.291
-I'm sorry about what happened.
-Were you in on it?

1:24:59.375 --> 1:25:01.708
Emma! You know me.

1:25:01.833 --> 1:25:02.750
Do I?

1:25:03.916 --> 1:25:05.250
What is this?

1:25:06.541 --> 1:25:07.500
What are we?

1:25:07.583 --> 1:25:09.583
-No, you know what we are.
-No, I don't.

1:25:11.083 --> 1:25:12.625
Do you know what it was like

1:25:12.708 --> 1:25:15.541

1:49:35.250 --> 1:49:36.916
Oh, honey…

1:49:38.041 --> 1:49:41.250
We need to talk to you
about something, okay? And I think it's…

1:49:42.416 --> 1:49:44.541
It's important that you understand

1:49:44.625 --> 1:49:47.916
the real reason
why we came here to visit you.

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.250
-It wasn't for the Hoosier pie?
-[chuckles]

1:49:50.333 --> 1:49:52.208
Well, I mean, um…

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.541
-We were in a show.
-A wonderful show.

1:49:57.625 --> 1:49:58.875
Well, I mean…

1:49:59.750 --> 1:50:02.541
[hesitating]
And we got blasted by the critics.

1:50:02.625 --> 1:50:05.916
They called us narcissists, and it hurt.

1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.916
And it hurt
because I guess they were right.

1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:14.250
So we looked around for a cause
that might give us some credibility.

1:50:14.333 --> 1:50:16.625
[chuckling] Maybe get us some good press.

1:50:16.708 --> 1:50:19.458

a house for Habitat for Humanity.

we're not capable of building anything.

1:50:22.291 --> 1:50:23.958
And then I found you on Twitter.

1:50:24.041 --> 1:50:27.666
I mean, it was just dumb luck,
but meant to be.

1:50:28.791 --> 1:50:32.583
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but…

1:50:33.333 --> 1:50:35.541
you're going to build something.

1:50:35.625 --> 1:50:38.375

-[all chuckling]

1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:43.041
Who gave you people
permission to be in here?

1:50:43.125 --> 1:50:46.208
-I did.
-You should have consulted with the PTA.

1:50:46.291 --> 1:50:49.958
Well, this is not a school event, so
I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval.

1:50:50.541 --> 1:50:54.375
I'm going to be
as clear as I possibly can.

1:50:55.416 --> 1:50:58.208
Your beliefs are not our beliefs.

1:50:58.291 --> 1:51:00.166
Hey, Emma. Can we talk to you?

1:51:06.125 --> 1:51:09.083
I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.

1:51:09.875 --> 1:51:13.416
You deserve to go to prom
just like any other kid.

1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:17.500
What? I thought you hated me.
I thought you all hated me.

1:51:17.583 --> 1:51:18.916
Oh, they hated you.

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:23.208
They hated you with a burning passion
stoked by centuries of intolerance

1:51:23.291 --> 1:51:25.291
and the lack of a drama program.

1:51:25.375 --> 1:51:26.791
I'm sorry, too, Emma.

1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:32.583
You know, you explain things really well.
You should be, like, a teacher.

1:51:32.666 --> 1:51:35.666
-Oh, you should be our drama teacher!
-[girl] Yes, please!

1:51:35.750 --> 1:51:37.416
You should do it. Do it.

1:51:38.916 --> 1:51:40.666
-You're hired!
-I'm a teacher!

1:51:40.750 --> 1:51:42.583
-As a temp.
-Absolutely.

1:51:42.666 --> 1:51:45.125
No, no, no! This is--
This is what I was afraid of.

1:51:45.208 --> 1:51:46.875
-Mom!
-Let me finish!

1:51:46.958 --> 1:51:50.416
No, you have got to stop talking
and just listen, okay?

1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:54.166
People don't turn gay.

1:51:55.250 --> 1:51:56.291
They are who they are.

1:51:56.375 --> 1:51:58.541
No. You don't know what you're saying.

1:51:58.625 --> 1:51:59.625

1:52:03.541 --> 1:52:07.583
Look, I know how you were raised,
but… the world's a different place.

1:52:08.291 --> 1:52:10.083
And sure, it's not great, but…

1:52:11.083 --> 1:52:16.250
it's… it's better because of people
who have the courage to be who they are.
