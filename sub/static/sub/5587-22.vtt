00:04.105 --> 00:06.905
<i> It logged nearly 7,000 hours</i>
<i> on his body</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:10.109
<i> and took part in</i>
<i> over 2,000 loads of laundry.</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:13.078
<i> He even gave it a name,</i>
<i> Big Orange.</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:14.713
Bye, Mom, off to school.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.848
Whoa! Back it up.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.549
It's picture day
for the yearbook.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.517
You're not wearing
that shirt.

00:18.519 --> 00:22.154
The creamsicle orange really
makes me pop off the page.

00:22.156 --> 00:22.855
No. No way.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.823
You wear that thing
all the time.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.592
Just look at these pictures
from last year.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.428

orange shirt.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.363

00:31.365 --> 00:33.432
Nunchucking Society,
orange shirt.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.001
BARRY: Don't forget
Zombie Survival Club.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.369
Colleges are gonna
snap me up.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.471
You know what
the coolest club is?

00:39.473 --> 00:43.575
The handsome Oxford
button down club! Huh?

00:43.577 --> 00:44.977
Look at me and know this.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.179
I will never take off
Big Orange.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.514
I will get married
in this shirt.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.149
I will win the Super Bowl
in this shirt.

00:50.151 --> 00:54.186
I will become President of
the United States of America

00:54.188 --> 00:54.887
in this shirt.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.423
Well, then I'm not gonna come
to your inauguration.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.958
Who am I kidding?
Of course I'll be there.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.527
And I'll iron that shirt.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.063
ADULT ADAM: <i> And as bad</i>
<i> as it was for my mom,</i>

01:04.065 --> 01:07.900
<i> it was even worse</i>
<i> for his girlfriend Lainey.</i>

01:08.803 --> 01:10.636
Happy anniversary, babe!

01:10.638 --> 01:13.705
Dude, I spent hours
on my make-up, fixing my hair,

01:13.707 --> 01:15.607
and squeezing into
this dress.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.009
I'm so lucky I'm a boy.

01:17.011 --> 01:17.810
I woke up like this.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.579
I was wearing this shirt
and everything.

01:21.182 --> 01:25.050
ADULT ADAM: <i> Lainey always</i>

<i> a surrogate smother,</i>

01:25.052 --> 01:28.821
<i> but nothing bonded them more</i>
<i> than one thing.</i>

01:28.823 --> 01:30.022
God, I hate that shirt.

01:30.024 --> 01:31.423
He looks like a walking
circus peanut.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.558
He looks like
an angry Cheez-It.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.826
It's like I'm dating
a glass of Tang.

01:33.828 --> 01:37.863
Once, when he was wearing it,
a panhandler gave him change.

01:37.865 --> 01:38.630
I had a dream I married it

01:38.632 --> 01:40.065
and we had little
orange shirt babies.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.434
I wish I could get him to
ditch it once and for all,

01:42.436 --> 01:43.735
but he won't listen to me.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.037
(SCOFFS) Or me.

01:45.039 --> 01:46.872
Wait.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.373
What about us.
Us?

01:48.375 --> 01:49.942
Separately,
we can't control him,

01:49.944 --> 01:53.979
but together,
we can join forces
and destroy him!

01:53.981 --> 01:54.480
With love.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.881
I like where
this is going.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.316
We hit him hard and fast.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.050
Let's juice this orange.

01:58.052 --> 02:01.186
Babe. We're gonna take you to
the mall and buy a new shirt.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.020
Already got one.
Thanks.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.357
Really think you
should let us take you
shopping, Schmoo.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.625
Mm, maybe some other time.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.427
Oh, assuming there is time.
I'm just trying
to help you, Barry.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.229
ADULT ADAM: <i> And so</i>
<i> the mother-girlfriend</i>
<i> onslaught began.</i>

02:10.231 --> 02:13.832
<i> My mom and Lainey spent the</i>
<i> next 10 minutes laying down</i>

02:13.834 --> 02:15.100
<i> the most intense guilt trip</i>

02:15.102 --> 02:16.401
<i> our family had ever seen.</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:17.669
All I know is I'll probably
just die brokenhearted.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.639
If that's the truth,
then why don't you trust me?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.008
Do you not love me?

02:24.111 --> 02:24.810
Okay.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.411
Great!
Wonderful.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.746
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:27.748 --> 02:28.413
What just happened?

02:28.415 --> 02:29.848
I think you're going
shopping

02:29.850 --> 02:31.083
for a new shirt,
kiddo.

02:31.085 --> 02:34.653
I really don't need one.
This one's great.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.121
(MUFFLED) Oh, shoot.

<i> It was May 11, 1980-something,</i>

02:53.674 --> 02:55.841
<i> and I was climbing the ladder</i>
<i> to my treehouse.</i>

02:55.843 --> 02:59.578
<i> It was my sanctuary,</i>
<i> the place I felt most safe.</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:02.114
Oh! Balls!

03:02.116 --> 03:04.383
That's it.
This treehouse is coming down.

03:04.385 --> 03:08.120
Your mother told me to
tear that thing immediately
two years ago.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.822
I was hoping it would rot from
the tree, but no such luck.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.625
No! You can't just destroy
a piece of our childhood.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.628
Trash it. It blocks my
rays during peak sun.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.030
Peak sun!
There you go.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.598
No.
Don't listen to her.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.166
That's my fortress
of solitude.

03:21.168 --> 03:22.935
(GROANS)
Can you please dismantle

03:22.937 --> 03:24.570
Adam's fortress of
dorkitude now?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.871
I would love to
get a good base

03:25.873 --> 03:27.539
before pool-party
season starts.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.575
I'm gonna get
my sledgehammer.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.776
Never!

03:30.778 --> 03:32.611
Damn it.
Where are you going?

03:32.613 --> 03:33.545
The only way to get me down

03:33.547 --> 03:35.614
is if you remove me
yourself!

03:35.616 --> 03:37.049
Whoa!

03:37.885 --> 03:39.051
Please don't do this.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.152
That treehouse means
everything to me.

03:40.154 --> 03:43.789
Why is this the one time
you're not giving in to
your laziness?

03:43.791 --> 03:45.324
Because I just had
my morning nap.

03:45.326 --> 03:49.328
Erica, help me out here.
Dad's threatening to be handy.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.028
Talk some sense into him!

03:50.030 --> 03:51.964
What about your experience
with me makes you think

03:51.966 --> 03:54.466
I'm gonna care about
this conversation at all?

03:54.468 --> 03:55.234
How can you say that?

03:55.236 --> 03:57.803
Don't you remember
all the awesome stuff

03:57.805 --> 03:58.937
we used to do up there?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.472
Sleepovers, stargazing,

04:00.474 --> 04:03.542
the bottle-rocket wars,

04:03.544 --> 04:05.744
No idea what you're
talking about.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.094
Want me to tell him
it's just a shirt?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.996
Don't just sit there.
Do something!

07:44.998 --> 07:46.298
What do you want me to do?

07:46.300 --> 07:46.865
Call 911.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.200
Tell them
there's an emergency,

07:48.202 --> 07:49.901
but don't get into details.

07:49.903 --> 07:50.335
Hurry!

07:50.337 --> 07:52.037
Tell them to put a shirt
doctor in the ambulance.

07:52.039 --> 07:56.074
God, why do bad things happen
to good T-shirts?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.843
I don't know.
Mom made a mistake?

07:57.845 --> 08:00.312
Mom never makes laundry
mistakes.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.346
Someone's out to get me!

08:01.348 --> 08:02.914
A third party did this
on purpose!

08:02.916 --> 08:05.584
Well, it's done. Just
cleaned out the treehouse.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.553
The Goldberg Gang is
officially out of business.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.221
No. Not yet!

08:09.223 --> 08:12.190
There's one more case
I need them to solve.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.426
There's been a murder,

08:14.428 --> 08:16.261
a shirt murder.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.563
This has my stepdad
written all over it.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.765
To the treehouse!

08:22.736 --> 08:24.135
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Even though Big Orange</i>
<i> was gone,</i>

08:24.137 --> 08:27.506
<i> Barry refused to rest</i>
<i> until the culprit was found.</i>

08:27.508 --> 08:29.508
We know you could've
taken this case to anyone,

08:29.510 --> 08:31.476
so we appreciate you
coming to us.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.311
Yeah. This is dumb,
so I'm gonna go.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.081
No! Wait! You guys got to
help me find out who did this.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.451
Big Orange's spirit will not
rest until the perpetrator

08:39.453 --> 08:41.386
has been found
and paid his debt.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.320
And what's in it for us?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.022
You mean besides
the justice served?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.957
Yeah, I'm gonna need
something real.

08:45.959 --> 08:50.161
I'll also pay you $7,000.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.097
Um, yeah, no brainer.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.064
It's my bar mitzvah money.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.500
I've been saving it up for
a moment exactly like this.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.936
For when someone destroyed
your $10 T-shirt?

08:57.938 --> 09:00.338
Don't you want to save it
for a trip to Europe

09:00.340 --> 09:01.940
or a down-payment on a h...

09:01.942 --> 09:02.574
Don't answer that.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.442
The Goldberg Gang
is on the case.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.478
Yes!
You know the drill, Erica.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.847
To the treehouse!

09:09.816 --> 09:12.717
That means frantically
run to the backyard
and start the case.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.553
You know,
to the treehouse!

09:14.555 --> 09:17.322
Fine, but we're walking
at a regular pace.

09:17.324 --> 09:17.889
To the treehouse!

09:17.891 --> 09:20.792
ADULT ADAM: <i> At long last,</i>
<i> the Goldberg Gang</i>
<i> was back on the beat!</i>

09:20.794 --> 09:22.627
<i> But before we could catch</i>
<i> the culprit,</i>

09:22.629 --> 09:24.729
<i> we first had to go over</i>
<i> the usual suspects.</i>

09:24.731 --> 09:28.867
Okay. This investigation
is officially open.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.602
It was Mom.
Too obvious!

09:30.604 --> 09:32.704
We need to think
outside the box.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.171
It was Mom.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.907
Figure out who
has the means...

09:35.909 --> 09:38.209
(READING)

09:38.211 --> 09:39.077
Which spells "Mom".

09:39.079 --> 09:40.879
Coincidence!
Fortunately for us,

09:40.881 --> 09:44.049
I've narrowed it down
to only 36 suspects.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.384
Suspect number one,
Pops.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.821
Put a few martinis in him,
he's capable of anything.

09:49.823 --> 09:50.655
It was Mom.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.090
Suspect number two, me.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.827
Am I guilty? Probably not,
but I do sleepwalk.

09:55.829 --> 09:56.928
It was Mom.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.629
Suspect number three!

09:57.631 --> 10:01.333
What is that?
A ghost, classic
<i> Scooby Doo</i> villain.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.267
Again, it was Mom.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.769
This is not a mystery,
we're not detectives,

10:04.771 --> 10:07.372
and this is not
our headquarters.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.708
What are you guys
doing up here?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.409
I told you I'm tearing
this down.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.713
You can't. Not now.
This case is heating up, man.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.047
Enough with the case!

10:16.049 --> 10:16.982
I don't want you out there,

10:16.984 --> 10:18.016
running around
like a loose cannon,

10:18.018 --> 10:22.420
because it's
my ass on the line,
and I won't have it!

10:22.422 --> 10:23.154
I got to find the truth!

10:23.156 --> 10:25.056
It's gotten too personal.
You're off the case.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.959
Give me your
magnifying glass
and your hat.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.494
You can't shut us down,
old man!

10:29.496 --> 10:30.862
Me and my partner
will not rest till

10:30.864 --> 10:34.432
we track down and
interrogate every
single option.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.502
ADULT ADAM: <i> And so our</i>
<i> intense search began.</i>

10:37.504 --> 10:38.136
It was you.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.271
Me? Please.
(CHUCKLES)

10:40.273 --> 10:42.641
You know how much I respect
laundry.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.375
My record's impeccable.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.510
Well, maybe it wasn't
an accident.
What are you saying?

10:45.512 --> 10:47.445
You've always had it out
for that shirt.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.347
Looks like you finally
pulled the trigger.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.983
Or it's not one person
at all.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.686
Maybe a crime this complex
is a two-man job.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.122
You don't know what you're
talking about, nerd boy!

10:57.124 --> 10:58.657
I mean, don't interrupt
your sister.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.891
(CHUCKLES)
You know, manners and stuff.

10:59.893 --> 11:04.162
I know that you're guilty,
and eventually, you'll crack.

11:04.164 --> 11:09.000
Until then, we will
follow every lead and
not stop until...

11:09.002 --> 11:10.135
Where'd she go?

11:10.137 --> 11:13.638
(WHISPERING)
To the treehouse!

11:14.808 --> 11:16.741
This is bad.
Real bad!

11:16.743 --> 11:17.642
They're closing in on us.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.577
Hold it together.
They got nothing.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.311
There's bleach on my hands.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.414
Just remember, this was
for Barry's own good.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.716
So you keep your pretty
little mouth shut!

11:24.718 --> 11:25.684
(GASPS)

11:25.686 --> 11:28.253
Looking good, snuggy boo.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.854
How do the new threads
feel?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.089
I look like a foreigner.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.992
A handsome,
stylish foreigner.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.695
Like a super hot
Balki Bartokomous.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.063
I miss my old shirt.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.165
I don't know who I am
anymore.

11:40.167 --> 11:44.436
Am I big or tasty?
No one knows!

11:44.438 --> 11:45.804
What have we done?

11:45.806 --> 11:47.706
When he finds out,
it's all over.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.040
Well, he's not gonna
find out.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.041
Ya dig?
I dig.

11:50.043 --> 11:54.045
Repeat after me.
"I am rock solid."

11:54.047 --> 11:56.381
I am rock solid.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.249
It was your mom and I.
We're, like, totally guilty.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.652
I have one question.
Who are you covering for?

12:00.654 --> 12:03.722
What? No one.
I literally just confessed.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.523
Well, isn't that
convenient?

12:05.525 --> 12:08.159
Typical patsy taking
the fall for a network

12:08.161 --> 12:08.827
of criminals above you.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.163
Why is he talking like that?
I, like, literally confessed.

12:12.165 --> 12:12.864
It's pathetic.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.167
He's stretching out the
whole Goldberg Gang thing
as long as he can.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.268
Just ignore him.

12:17.270 --> 12:17.969
Look, you got to drop it.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.405
If Barry finds out what I did,
he'll never forgive me.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.873
Fine. Your secret's
safe with me.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.743
I'll save your implausible
relationship with my brother.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.779
You can't ignore the facts!
This conspiracy runs deep.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.014
I'll bring the real culprits
to justice. You'll see!

12:30.016 --> 12:33.351
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Lainey may have confessed,</i>
<i> but I wasn't convinced.</i>

12:33.353 --> 12:36.621
<i> I was about to blow this case</i>
<i> wide open.</i>

12:36.623 --> 12:37.288
Dude, you okay?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.690
Yeah, Adam said you had
a bathroom-based emergency.

12:38.692 --> 12:41.893
Yeah, I brought the back-up
khakis from my locker.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.727
This isn't my first rodeo.

12:42.729 --> 12:47.365
What? Adam said you guys had
a bathroom-based emergency.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.668
I, too, have attended
that sad rodeo.

12:50.670 --> 12:51.569
Gentlemen.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.073
There is
no bathroom-based
emergency,

12:55.075 --> 12:57.776
only a laundry-based mystery,

12:57.778 --> 12:58.710
and I've gathered
all of you here

12:58.712 --> 13:02.046
'cause the culprit
stands amongst us.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.715
JTP, is this true?

13:03.717 --> 13:04.382
What?
Never!

13:04.384 --> 13:06.017
So that's a no
on the khakis?

13:06.019 --> 13:08.620
They were
all over at the house
on the day in question.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.790
That means all of you
had opportunity.

13:11.792 --> 13:12.557
That's insane.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.526
Insane like the jealousy
you felt

13:14.528 --> 13:15.593
every time Barry
wore Big Orange?

13:15.595 --> 13:19.230
You loved that shirt but knew
you could never pull it off,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.698
'cause you were too tiny.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.966
I prefer small-boned.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.835
Or was it Naked Rob?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.603
A closet Penguins fan.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.939
The Penguins?
Robert.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.207
I was born in Pittsburgh.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.775
Or maybe it was
Geoff Schwartz!

13:30.777 --> 13:33.645
You knew taking out
Barry's favorite shirt

13:33.647 --> 13:34.345
would make him melt down.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.747
Lainey would have to
console him,

13:35.749 --> 13:37.682
leaving Erica without
a best friend

13:37.684 --> 13:40.318
and plenty of time for you
to win her heart.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.620
Wait, would that work?
I will kill you dead!

13:42.622 --> 13:43.788
No, Barry.
I didn't do it!

13:43.790 --> 13:46.424
He's right.
He didn't do it...

13:46.426 --> 13:47.358
alone.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.494
It was the entire JTP!

13:49.496 --> 13:53.464
Okay. If this is true,

13:53.466 --> 13:55.233
I must disband the JTP.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.701
ALL: JTP?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.268
Oh, it's true.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.971
Thank God I kept digging
even after Lainey confessed

13:59.973 --> 14:02.140
to destroying the shirt
with Mom.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.076
Yeah, thank God.

14:05.078 --> 14:05.610
Wait, what?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.979
I can't believe
the two of you

14:07.981 --> 14:08.880
would betray me like this.

14:08.882 --> 14:12.684
Big Orange was better to me
than either of you ever were.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.351
It's just a shirt, babe.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.886
We didn't know how much
it meant to you.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.388
And in our defense,
we didn't know we'd
get caught.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.923
BARRY: I don't
want to hear it!

14:18.925 --> 14:19.724
From this moment on,

14:19.726 --> 14:24.329
I officially declare I have
no girlfriend and no mother.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.330
You can't do that.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.497
Yeah, you can't do that.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.498
Well, you can do it to her,

14:27.500 --> 14:28.566
but you can't do it
to your mother.

14:28.568 --> 14:32.170
I say this all the time,
you only have one mother.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.238
Well, I'll find another one.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.273
You wouldn't dare.
I will.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.341
I'll tell that nice,
old lunch lady

14:36.343 --> 14:40.445
who always calls me "son"
to put her money where
her mouth is.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.013
Well, I hate
to point fingers,

14:42.015 --> 14:44.182
but, uh, this is
on you and only you

14:44.184 --> 14:45.183
and no one else
and not me.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.719
Are you kidding me?
This whole thing was
your idea.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.621
What kind of mother
does that to her son?

14:49.623 --> 14:51.189
A mother
who doesn't approve

14:51.191 --> 14:53.424
of her son's snitch
of a girlfriend.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.893
Ex-girlfriend,
thanks to you!

14:54.895 --> 14:58.830
You promised not to tell
and you narced like a narc,
you narc.

14:58.832 --> 14:59.631
I didn't tell Barry.

14:59.633 --> 15:00.698
The little geek went off
on his own.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.835
Only 'cause you
and Dad kept insisting
I drop the case.

15:03.837 --> 15:04.869
Wait, Murray.
You knew about this?

15:04.871 --> 15:08.740
Great. I told you
not to go off half-cocked
like a cowboy,

15:08.742 --> 15:10.808
but you had to play
by your own rules!

15:10.810 --> 15:16.047
That's as much anger
as I can muster for
something so stupid.

15:16.049 --> 15:16.681
Great job, genius.

15:16.683 --> 15:20.184
You made
everyone in this house
completely turn on each other.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.619
Blame yourself, narc.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.122
And I would've gotten away
with it, too,

15:24.124 --> 15:27.592
if it weren't for you
meddling kids.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.226
It's not my fault.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.560
The case seemed
so cut and dry.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.996
Back when we were kids,
there was always a twist.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.966
Hello! Mom forced me to go up
in that treehouse

15:34.968 --> 15:38.569
and play with you,
so I made up all those cases.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.806
So, you lied to me?

15:41.808 --> 15:42.607
Yes. My God.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.143
You are going to be
in high school next year.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.911
You need to grow up,
and fast,

15:46.913 --> 15:49.414
because I'm done
taking care of you!

15:49.416 --> 15:50.048
I just...

15:50.050 --> 15:52.083
wanted to hang out
like we used to.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.985
That's all I wanted.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.926
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It had been a day since Barry</i>
<i> had lost Big Orange forever,</i>

16:01.928 --> 16:03.594
<i> or so he thought.</i>

16:03.596 --> 16:04.762
Ta-da!

16:04.764 --> 16:05.663
What's this?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.298
It's Big Orange, squishy.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.566
Big Orange is gone.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.233
Big Orange was gone,

16:09.235 --> 16:11.469
but I sewed him up, dyed him,
and steamed him real good,

16:11.471 --> 16:14.372
and now he's bigger, better,
and more orangy than ever.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.640
Hey, big tasty,
look what I got!

16:15.642 --> 16:17.342
And old friend
wants to say "hello".

16:17.344 --> 16:20.945
(LAUGHS) Wow!
Lucky me!

16:20.947 --> 16:22.747
Now I got two Big Oranges.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.882
What the...
Why are you here?

16:24.884 --> 16:25.783
To get Barry back.

16:25.785 --> 16:26.884
That's what
I was trying to do,

16:26.886 --> 16:28.820
but now you're screwing me
in the pooper!

16:28.822 --> 16:29.954
Oh, sweet God!

16:29.956 --> 16:30.989
What? What'd I say?
Is that bad?

16:30.991 --> 16:34.225
Unbelievable!
You not only
destroy my shirt,

16:34.227 --> 16:37.061
but come in here and try
pawning off these imposters?

16:37.063 --> 16:39.597
Imposters?
Mama fixed it.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.832
This is the real thing.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.200
No, this is.
This is it.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.602
This shirt is. See?
It's orange and a shirt.

16:44.604 --> 16:48.106
I reject all these shirts
with their coarse material

16:48.108 --> 16:51.809
and tight collar
and non-stained pit parts.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.812
These aren't Big Orange,
they're big lies.

16:54.814 --> 16:55.780
I know you're upset,
sweetie,

16:55.782 --> 16:58.516
but don't throw out
the Beverly with the
Lainey water.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.786
Hey, hey! Look what
I sewed back up!

17:01.788 --> 17:05.189
Large Orange,
now everyone's happy.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.190
That's Garfield!

17:06.192 --> 17:09.027
I need to punch something.
Adam, I need you!

17:09.029 --> 17:10.628
That did not go well.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.897
It's over.
I have no son.

17:12.899 --> 17:13.731
And I have no boyfriend.

17:13.733 --> 17:18.069
I think Garfunkle is sporty.
I'm keeping this thing.

17:18.071 --> 17:21.506
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my mom and Lainey realized</i>

17:21.508 --> 17:23.741
<i> they hadn't just ruined</i>
<i> Barry's shirt,</i>

17:23.743 --> 17:25.510
<i> they destroyed his trust.</i>

17:25.512 --> 17:26.677
<i> There was only one way</i>
<i> to win him back,</i>

17:26.679 --> 17:32.283
<i> and that meant helping him</i>
<i> truly cope with his loss.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:34.585
What's going on?

17:34.587 --> 17:35.853
Look, we messed up,

17:35.855 --> 17:38.423
and we know there's no way
of going back,

17:38.425 --> 17:41.959
so we brought everyone here
to help you move forward.

17:41.961 --> 17:45.063
By saying goodbye,
the right way.

17:46.199 --> 17:50.601
This is nice.
My shirt would've
liked this.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.404
They really did a great job
with Big Orange, Bar.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.039
Yeah, they really did.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.375
They made him look
so peaceful.
(TV PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

17:57.377 --> 17:59.977
Murray!
Turn off the TV.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.113
I'll mute it,
but that's it.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.948
It's just a shirt.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.284
<i> (WALKING ON SUNSHINE</i> PLAYS)

18:06.286 --> 18:09.921
<i> ¶ I used to think maybe</i>
<i> you loved me</i>

18:09.923 --> 18:11.789
Honey, do you have anything
you want to say?

18:11.791 --> 18:15.526
<i> ¶ Now, baby, I'm sure</i>

18:17.497 --> 18:20.364
I'd like to say a few words
about Big Orange.

18:20.366 --> 18:25.303
It's like, life goes so fast
when you're growing up.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.639
I guess it was nice
there was something
that was always the same.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.909
I mean, all my
greatest memories were
in that shirt. Dad!

18:31.911 --> 18:36.380
<i> ¶ Go to hold myself down</i>
I was wearing it when we went
to our first Flyers game.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.749
It's a shirt!

18:38.751 --> 18:40.284
JTP, the first time

18:40.286 --> 18:41.686
I ever played smashball,
I was in that shirt.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.955
<i> ¶ 'Cause I just can't wait</i>
(ALL GROAN, LAUGH)

18:43.957 --> 18:45.123
JTP.
JTP.

18:45.125 --> 18:49.127
Ma, you taught me how
to cook in that shirt.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.829
Lainey, I ran in the rain
in that shirt

18:51.831 --> 18:54.699
to tell you how much
I love you.
<i> ¶ Now I'm walking on sunshine</i>

18:54.701 --> 18:55.766
<i> ¶ Whoa-oa-oh</i>

18:55.768 --> 18:58.803
So I guess...
<i> ¶ I'm walking on sunshine</i>

18:58.805 --> 18:59.704
...I'm gonna miss
the memories...

18:59.706 --> 19:01.739
<i> ¶ Whoa-oa-oh</i>
...But I'm glad
I still have them.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.876
<i> ¶ I'm walking on sunshine</i>
To Big Orange!

19:04.878 --> 19:06.344
ALL: To Big Orange!

19:06.346 --> 19:10.548
Wait, that's what this is?
A shirt funeral?
<i> ¶ And don't it feel good?</i>

19:10.550 --> 19:13.651
Damn it. I missed
a real funeral for this.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.021
<i> ¶ And don't it feel good?</i>

19:17.023 --> 19:17.755
<i> ¶ All right, now, yeah ¶</i>

ADULT ADAM: <i> The most</i>

19:22.529 --> 19:23.528
<i> But as much as it hurts,</i>

19:23.530 --> 19:26.430
<i> we all have to tear down</i>

<i> Okay, over and out.</i>

19:43.183 --> 19:45.249
Still watching those
old tapes, huh?

19:45.251 --> 19:46.751
Don't worry. I'm over it.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.519
Come with me. I want
to show you something.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.622
Why would I want to go
anywhere with you?

19:52.559 --> 19:54.792
I thought you like mysteries.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.796

<i> I just want you back</i>

19:58.798 --> 20:00.998

20:01.000 --> 20:01.532
What's this?

20:01.534 --> 20:04.068
I thought we could build
a new treehouse.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.369
But I thought it was time
to let it go.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.773
Well, some things
are worth holding on to.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.809
Our old blueprints?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.211
You still have them?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.112
The truth is,
when we were kids,

20:15.114 --> 20:18.516
I didn't make up those
mysteries because I had to.

20:18.518 --> 20:21.786
I did it 'cause I loved
spending time with you.

ADULT ADAM: <i> Letting go</i>
