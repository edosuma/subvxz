01:50.720 --> 01:52.631
This is creepy, Daddy. Where is everybody?

01:52.720 --> 01:54.995
I'm sure they're all hard at work, darling.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.993
Come on.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.118
This is so unbelievably low rent.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.394
Good afternoon.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.430
We're here to see Miss Fritton.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.272
You're not from t' Inland Revenue?

02:29.360 --> 02:32.397
No. I'm er... Camilla's younger brother.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.390
<i>Ooh</i>

02:33.480 --> 02:35.311
You'll have to forgive me.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.473
My brain doesn't kick in till Wednesday
when I've been caning it all weekend.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.073
You know what I mean.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.309
Miss Fritton, your brother's here to see you.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.994
<i>I can't understand
a word you're saying</i>

02:47.680 --> 02:50.513
<i>I said your brother's here to see you</i>

02:57.760 --> 02:59.796
<i>Carnaby Fritton</i>

03:04.560 --> 03:06.949
<i>No no listen to me very carefully</i>

03:07.040 --> 03:08.871
Why would I buy a picture

03:08.960 --> 03:11.997
from someone of your dubious reputation?

03:13.680 --> 03:16.114
That's what you do, isn't it, Carnaby?

03:17.520 --> 03:19.397
I'll get back to you.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.759
Hello, Camilla.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.471
Mr Darcy, stop that at once.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.279
Go to your happy place.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.837
Carnaby Fritton.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.151
Oh, I haven't heard a word from you
in over 15 years.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.798
I sent flowers.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.757
A wreath...

03:45.840 --> 03:47.831
for Mummy's funeral.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.158
Oh, you must be my lully,
lully niece Annabelle.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.117
You're all clear.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.350
Oh.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.515
So... your father's PA

04:09.600 --> 04:12.637
tells me you're joining us from
Cheltenham Ladies' College.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.757
For the life of me, I can't understand
why he sent you there.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.719
Yes, I was an utter fool to be taken in
by the excellent teaching standards

04:19.800 --> 04:23.952
and their consistently high performance
in league tables.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.793
In my experience,
the teachers are insufferable snobs,

04:26.880 --> 04:28.074
and the girls are all shits.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.112
Not to worry, my dear.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.556
Here, pupil and teacher live in blissful harmony.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.270
Daddy.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.709
<i>Daddy you can't expect me to stay here</i>

04:45.680 --> 04:47.352
It's like Hogwarts for pikeys.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.475
It's a little rough around the edges, darling.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.358
But that's part of the fun of the place.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.149
Here is a breakdown of the school fees.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.872
Whisky?

05:10.400 --> 05:12.675
There seems to be some kind of mistake.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.190
The Bursar never makes mistakes about money,
unless it's for tax purposes.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.589
But what about... a family discount?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.557
Family discount!

05:24.520 --> 05:27.432
You discounted the family years ago,
Carnaby Fritton,

05:27.520 --> 05:31.479
when you ruined Great Aunt Millicent
with your hair-brained schemes.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.835
I've done nothing to feel guilty about.

05:36.560 --> 05:41.350
Your father has a short memory
masquerading as a clear conscience.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.271
The fees are 4,000.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.237
1,500.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.231
3,000, take it or leave it.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.197
Let's call it 2,000, cash.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.759
2,500.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.717
- Two and a quarter.
- Two-three.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.677
Two-three, done.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.597
Daddy, you can't leave me here.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.352
Don't be silly, darling.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.317
It'll be half term before you know it.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.277
- Bonne chance!
- Daddy!

06:05.360 --> 06:07.237
Daddy!

06:58.440 --> 07:01.318
Your old man's Roller
looks like it's seen better days.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.714
No.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.279
It's a classic.

07:04.360 --> 07:08.035
Daddy's an expert on the finer things.
He has an art gallery in Mayfair.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.238
I'm Annabelle...

07:11.320 --> 07:13.197
Miss Fritton's niece.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.396
I'll have someone come fetch your bags.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.597
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.597
Kelly Jones.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.432
I'm head girl.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.790
Really?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.357
Welcome to St Trinian's.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.070
# MARK RONSON feat.
Oh, My God

07:35.800 --> 07:37.916
# I've never been this far away from home

07:38.400 --> 07:40.470
# And, oh, my God, I can't believe it

07:40.600 --> 07:43.478
# I've never been this far away from home

07:43.560 --> 07:46.233
What are you bogging at... Ugly Betty?

07:46.360 --> 07:47.679
Know where my bed is?

07:47.760 --> 07:50.558
You saying I nicked your bed?
Is that what you're saying?

07:50.640 --> 07:51.868
I'll give you a slap.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.837
Back off, Taylor.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.797
Go paint your nails.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.599
She who angers you conquers you.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.557
Whatever.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.436
Weirdo.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.992
The Chavs are a bit touchy at the moment.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.718
Oi, are you calling me a chav?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.791
So, I told him...

08:08.880 --> 08:10.598
They run a chatline

08:10.680 --> 08:13.399
and all claim to have slept with
a member of the Royal Family.

08:13.480 --> 08:17.234
When you've dropped that many
US bonds in the market, begin trading...

08:17.320 --> 08:18.594
<i>Refused credit?</i>

08:18.680 --> 08:19.954
<i>Talk to the Geeks</i>

08:20.040 --> 08:21.951
What about this lot? Are they asleep?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.510
Goths.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.517
We're not Goths, we're Emos.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.599
What are Emos?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.557
Emotionally unstable.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.471
First years.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.916
<i>Fulchester's answer to The Sopranos</i>

08:43.760 --> 08:45.637
This is you.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.712
<i>What are they betting on?</i>

08:54.800 --> 08:56.028
How long you'll last.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.269
# And oh, my God, I can't believe it

09:01.360 --> 09:04.272
# I've never been this far away from home

09:04.360 --> 09:06.669
# And oh, my God, I can't believe it

09:06.760 --> 09:09.274
# I've never been this far away from home

09:09.560 --> 09:11.630
# And oh, my God, I can't believe it

09:12.040 --> 09:14.235
# I've never been this far away from...

09:28.040 --> 09:29.678
All right, girls.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.637
We're live on YouTube.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.997
Hm.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.712
Now we'll see what she's made of.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.917
New girl.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.637
<i>- Daddy?
- Hello?</i>

10:39.560 --> 10:42.552
<i>- Sorry, Daddy, did I wake you?
- What is it darling?</i>

10:43.600 --> 10:46.717
I want you to come and pick me up
from this hell hole right now.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.109
I've been broadcast on the Internet.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.112
<i>It's like a schoolgirl prank that's all</i>

10:53.200 --> 10:56.875
Naked, Daddy!
I want you to get me now.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.837
<i>Who's that?</i>

10:58.920 --> 11:02.629
<i>Nobody darling I'm tucked up in bed
watching Desperate Housewives</i>

11:04.680 --> 11:06.830
Daddy, are you coming or not?

11:06.920 --> 11:09.559
I'm losing you, darling. Cc-hhh!

11:09.640 --> 11:11.119
Hello? Hello?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.155
Cc-hhh!

11:14.160 --> 11:15.673
Ohh!

11:22.120 --> 11:23.599
Annabelle Fritton!

11:25.320 --> 11:26.435
Uh... er...

11:26.520 --> 11:28.158
I can't believe what you just did.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.037
I'm sorry, miss.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.997
I don't know what came over me.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.548
I've been looking for someone
with a shot like that.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.200
I'm drafting you into the hockey team
as of today.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.477
# Nine2Five

11:48.200 --> 11:49.633
He's here.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.951
# Oh, my gosh, my days are getting longer

11:53.040 --> 11:56.794
# And there's no turning back,
I'm working the nine to five

11:56.880 --> 11:58.950
# Just to keep my contract

11:59.040 --> 12:00.917
# Did I say nine? I meant 1:30

12:01.000 --> 12:04.595
# I ain't no early birdy,
I'm working the nine to five

12:05.640 --> 12:07.517
Bonsoir, nitwits.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.717
Evening. Make it silver.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.308
# So you gotta do some idents,
what channel are you?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.277
# Channel who?
Sorry I'm haltered for a snooze

12:17.360 --> 12:19.555
# Oh, Channel U,
the ones that made me huge

12:19.640 --> 12:21.119
# Like Katie Price's boobs

12:21.200 --> 12:22.519
# Whoops! I'm being rude

12:22.600 --> 12:25.239
# Where's my Red Bull
and my sandwich? I need food!

12:25.320 --> 12:26.514
# I can't handle this

12:26.600 --> 12:29.068
# I'm getting... like Pampers throwing a tantrum

12:29.160 --> 12:32.436
# Oh, my gosh, my days are getting longer

12:32.520 --> 12:36.308
# And there's no turning back,
I'm working the nine to five

12:36.400 --> 12:38.277
# Just to keep my contract

12:38.360 --> 12:40.271
# Did I say nine? I meant 1:30

12:40.360 --> 12:44.194
# I ain't no early birdy,
I'm working the nine to five

12:48.400 --> 12:51.710
Well, I um... love the new packaging, girls.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.190
But what about the problems
we had with the last batch?

12:55.280 --> 12:56.759
Problems, Flash?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.115
Yeah, the slightly bitter aftertaste,

12:59.840 --> 13:02.274
people going blind after the second glass...

13:02.360 --> 13:04.635
that lady what died...

13:04.720 --> 13:06.870
She was old. She could have gone at any time.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.592
She was 38.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.272
Yeah?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.277
Anoushka. Come here, girl.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.837
- Na zdorovye!
- Abramovich.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.352
Are you all right?

13:40.440 --> 13:43.034
- No problem, Flash.
- We got ourselves a deal, then.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.189
Excellent.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.273
If that's permanent...

13:48.360 --> 13:50.157
I'll see you in court.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.116
Just be aware of that.

13:54.280 --> 13:54.951
Ta-da!

13:55.040 --> 13:57.918
Nice. Wow. What have we here?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.355
It looks lovely, anyway.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.556
Like Christmas. What's this, then?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.119
Like, sweets, is it? A cigar?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.199
Hey, look at me.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.874
- They're tampons, Flash.
- What?! Oh!

14:08.960 --> 14:12.350
- Designer tampons.
- Why? Why do you do that?

14:12.440 --> 14:15.910
A woman doesn't only want to look
beautiful on the outside.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.673
I can't sell a product I don't believe in. Come on.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.919
You wanted a word, Flash?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.275
Ooh, yeah. All right, girls.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.396
Yeah, well, carry on.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.959
<i>Keep at it</i>

14:28.040 --> 14:30.315
Yes. Um...

14:30.880 --> 14:35.078
I was wondering if you could have
a word with the Maths Department.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.798
What's the problem?

14:36.880 --> 14:39.269
They're very keen to place a bet and that,

14:39.360 --> 14:42.830
but they're not so forthcoming
when it comes to squaring it with the bookie,

14:42.920 --> 14:45.229
if you get my drift.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.869
Teachers.
Keeping them in line is a full-time occupation.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.877
Kell, um...

14:56.600 --> 14:58.716
A new Chinese opened in the high street.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.677
Apparently it's handsome.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.672
I wondered if you weren't too busy,
maybe one night this week.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.276
Shoot me down in flames if it's not a good idea,
but I thought we could pop along, the two of us.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.749
- I don't think so, Flash.
- No. Stupid idea.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.717
I don't mix business with pleasure.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.799
And I've got a lot on.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.757
<i>Very busy.</i>

15:16.840 --> 15:20.355
Busy with all my... gear here, so...

15:20.440 --> 15:23.796
# And there's no turning back,
I'm working the nine to five

15:23.880 --> 15:25.393
# Just to keep my contract...

15:25.480 --> 15:27.471
- Nice work on the paint job.
- Night, Flash.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.755
- Auf Wiedersehen, girls.
- See you soon.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.151
<i>Incoming 10 degrees south possible hostile</i>

15:45.800 --> 15:47.392
<i>Intruder located</i>

15:47.480 --> 15:49.198
First years, into position.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.758
<i>Morning Miss</i>

15:56.360 --> 15:58.351
<i>Oh!</i>

16:00.040 --> 16:02.918
But we still need to pay the staff.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.831
Otherwise they'll go out on strike.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.638
Not now, Bursar.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.918
Miss Fritton, if we don't take
a firm grasp of this situation,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.956
then St Trinian's will have to...

16:14.040 --> 16:16.110
Not now.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.070
Some dosser's just pitched up.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.838
<i>She claims she's our new English teacher
She doesn't look like it</i>

16:26.920 --> 16:28.831
She looks like she hasn't got a pot to piss in.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.275
<i>- Beverly
- Sorry, Miss Fritton.</i>

16:32.280 --> 16:36.876
She doesn't look like she's got a pot
in which to piss.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.512
<i>That's better</i>

16:40.240 --> 16:44.392
Ah, Miss Fritton,
my references and qualifications.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.277
Oh, my dear, how lovely.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.397
That you made it down the drive
is qualification enough.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.357
I daresay you'll do very well.

16:51.440 --> 16:55.069
The agency tells me you've lost
four English teachers in six months.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.151
<i>Very careless of us.</i>

16:57.240 --> 16:59.435
I expect they'll turn up.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.397
Moorcroft! Tuck that shirt in!

17:01.480 --> 17:03.391
Sorry, Miss.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.632
<i>Muy bien chicas</i>

17:24.960 --> 17:26.313
How do you feel, girls?

17:26.400 --> 17:29.153
- Much better, Miss.
- Anger management. Carry on.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.596
No. No, no, no. You will get paid.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.233
I promise.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.432
Everyone...

17:45.960 --> 17:50.750
I'd like to introduce you to
our new English teacher. Miss Dickinson.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.475
Hello.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.959
Welcome.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.356
You must try my latest concoction.
It's a real beauty.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.236
- I call it The Gerald.
- The Gerald.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.912
After my first husband.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.150
Cheap, bitter and completely alcoholic.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.110
- Have you been drinking again?
- No. no.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.433
Just a little breathless.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.193
Go on. I'm dying to know what you think.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.396
I... I'm teetotal, I'm afraid.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.236
But I do like having fun
as much as the next person.

18:26.640 --> 18:30.713
In fact, I'd love it if we could all
get involved in School Challenge.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.357
<i>TV quiz show.</i>

18:34.160 --> 18:35.912
Popular at my last school

18:36.000 --> 18:38.639
and tremendous fun
for both pupils and teachers.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.835
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning, Mr Thwaites.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.069
Please, sit.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.628
Now, as you know all too well,

18:52.720 --> 18:55.632
our nation's schools have been blighted
by the false kindness

18:55.720 --> 18:58.553
of namby-pamby, touchy-feely policies
for far too long.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.672
Badly behaved children don't need
an arm around the shoulder.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.832
They need a good kick up the arse.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.798
May we say "shot in the arm," sir?
For the tabloids?

19:07.880 --> 19:12.032
Say what you need to say.
The important thing is what we do.

19:12.120 --> 19:15.908
I intend to start with the worst schools
in the country.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.833
But that would mean St Trinian's, sir.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.479
- What's the matter with him?
- Five years ago he went to...

19:24.560 --> 19:26.471
that place undercover.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.108
He's suffered severe
and recurrent trauma ever since.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.033
Really? From a bunch of naughty schoolgirls?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.234
You wouldn't know, man. You weren't there.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.992
<i>When I overhauled the prison service</i>

19:38.080 --> 19:42.949
I began by tackling the most fractious,
lawless and feared institutions around.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.316
Once I'd dealt with those,
the others simply fell into place.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.600
We'll take the same approach with St Trinian's.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.717
Be afraid, sir. Be very afraid.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.278
Right. On my command, unleash hell.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.117
- Daddy!
- Hello, darling.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.117
Daddy, look!

20:37.200 --> 20:39.270
They're bloody animals.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.193
Animals! I'm going to kill them!

20:42.280 --> 20:45.795
Try to remember
what your behavioural therapist said. Run along.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.518
We've entered bedlam. The very gates of hell.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.672
I don't understand
why you didn't close this place years ago.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.354
Because, Miss Bagstock,
they can change. And they will.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.470
Not this lot. You'd understand
if you met their headmistress.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.958
Between you and I,
she's worse than the children.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.031
A Miss Fritton.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.075
Camilla.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.957
# Love Is A Many Splendoured Thing

21:14.040 --> 21:16.713
<i>That's right Completely barking mad
Have you heard of her?</i>

21:16.800 --> 21:19.030
Ah, Miss Bagstock.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.271
Your girlish laughter
hit me like the lash of a hunting crop.

21:22.360 --> 21:26.512
Miss Fritton, I don't expect you've met
our new Minister of Education.

21:26.600 --> 21:32.630
# Love is a many splendoured thing

21:33.520 --> 21:35.875
- Geoffrey.
- Miss Fritton.

21:39.280 --> 21:43.193
- So you have met?
- University.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.475
We were the toast of the dramatic society.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.437
Oh, Geoffrey.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.757
Another time...

21:49.840 --> 21:51.558
Another Country.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.108
<i>To what do I owe the pleasure?</i>

21:54.200 --> 21:58.352
I've heard that your school is a hotbed
of anarchy, ill-discipline...

21:58.440 --> 21:59.350
Oh.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.954
...and your academic results are a disaster.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.600
- So I'm here to help.
- How lovely.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.349
I've got some shelves that need putting up
and the kitchens need a good scrub.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.273
Unsanitary catering facilities.
I'll add that to the list.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.796
You know, I think you'll find
you and I both want the same things.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.553
We just happen to be sitting on
different sides of the table.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.359
Table? Mortuary slab, I'd say, Geoffrey.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.318
You want to straitjacket us
with your limited curriculum,

22:25.400 --> 22:29.313
which has become nothing more than
state-circulated Chinese whispers

22:29.400 --> 22:31.550
and you call it education.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.031
You've changed, Geoffrey.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.916
You haven't.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.992
I think Mr Darcy likes you.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.677
Let it dry, and then a good stiff brush.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.113
Oh, my God. It's Verity Thwaites.
She's a total psycho.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.317
<i>Come on Cheltenham Ladies
Show them what you're made of</i>

23:07.000 --> 23:09.036
The important thing is not to provoke her.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.476
Who let the dogs out?
Who? Who? Who-who?

23:12.560 --> 23:15.028
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who?

23:15.480 --> 23:18.756
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who-who?

23:18.840 --> 23:21.149
So, what do you think of my girls?

23:21.240 --> 23:23.549
- Hawes!
- I beg your pardon?

23:23.640 --> 23:26.757
Jemma Hawes, pull your socks up.
You're a Cheltenham Lady.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.520
I'm sure your girls will try their very best.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.275
But It's not the winning that matters.
It's the taking part that counts.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.638
Snooty cow.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.073
Sorry?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.833
Emily Snooty-Cow, do remember to stretch.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.237
Jolly good. Jolly good.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.792
Girls!

23:48.880 --> 23:50.757
Look who it is.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.315
It's Annabelle the Cannibal.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.357
What's that all about?

24:01.920 --> 24:03.478
I used to eat people.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.039
What?

24:07.120 --> 24:10.908
I used to have braces
and bits of food got stuck in them.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.597
Nice.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.557
OK, girls, let's play clean.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.635
No biting, scratching, kicking.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.039
No gouging.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.870
<i>No headbutting no punching</i>

25:19.960 --> 25:22.793
No slapping, spitting. No um...

25:24.280 --> 25:25.713
No gouging.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.837
And um... no non -regulation equipment.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.797
Janey, I'm talking to you.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.112
OK, into position.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.314
<i>Come on, girls, let's take them down.</i>

25:45.960 --> 25:47.837
Ooh!

25:47.920 --> 25:49.797
On you go, Matron.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.279
Right you are.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.998
You do know the rules, don't you?

25:53.080 --> 25:54.513
Nope.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.510
Oh.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.070
- Good shot!
- Yes!

26:07.160 --> 26:08.309
Yes!

27:23.320 --> 27:24.639
- Barbed wire?
- Check.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.119
- Crowbar?
- Check.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.519
- Wheel clamp.
- Check.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.795
<i>- Follow the tools girls
- Wait for me.</i>

27:29.880 --> 27:31.598
<i>Hurry up slow coach</i>

27:36.760 --> 27:39.320
- He didn't?
- He did!

27:39.400 --> 27:41.356
It was just so disgusting.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.717
It was still quite funny.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.677
But then I said to him, "You didn't?"

27:47.480 --> 27:49.436
And he said, "I did."

27:50.160 --> 27:52.549
- He didn't?
- He did. Just imagine!

28:01.280 --> 28:03.157
Posh Totty.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.677
Hello, big boy.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.953
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Shoo.

28:11.480 --> 28:14.278
I'm wearing my school uniform, silly.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.152
Although, I'm about to get changed
into my gym kit.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.469
<i>I did really well in my last oral</i>

28:22.560 --> 28:26.314
<i>Although I did find it a bit of a mouthful at first</i>

28:26.400 --> 28:30.279
<i>But Miss says if I practise as often as I can</i>

28:30.360 --> 28:32.510
<i>I could become Head Girl.</i>

28:35.240 --> 28:37.117
We're onto you, so watch your backs!

28:37.200 --> 28:39.031
Feel the fear. We're maniacs!

28:39.120 --> 28:40.439
St Trinian's!

28:42.720 --> 28:45.598
M-A-N -l-A-C. St Trinian's!

28:45.680 --> 28:46.635
Look out.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.913
Don't Give Up

28:53.000 --> 28:55.434
# If I tried to tell you to do what for?

28:57.120 --> 28:59.759
# Can't you see life's knocking right at your door

29:00.720 --> 29:03.792
# I just don't know for sure

29:08.000 --> 29:09.877
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:10.200 --> 29:12.077
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:12.240 --> 29:13.832
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:14.480 --> 29:16.357
# Don't give up, don't give up!

29:25.040 --> 29:27.156
Does anybody have any smelling salts?

29:27.240 --> 29:28.719
No, but I've got poppers.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.591
Go, girlie! Go, girlie!

29:33.720 --> 29:36.188
# Can't you see life's knocking right at your door

29:38.160 --> 29:40.037
Fair play.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.877
# What if I tried to tell you to do what for

29:43.960 --> 29:45.837
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:46.720 --> 29:48.233
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:48.680 --> 29:50.557
# Don't give up, don't give up

29:50.960 --> 29:52.951
# Don't give up, don't give up!

29:58.960 --> 30:01.030
Girlie, girlie, girlie! Ha-ha!

30:02.920 --> 30:04.592
<i>I know it's very hard Charles</i>

30:04.720 --> 30:06.676
<i>and most of the girls hate it</i>

30:06.760 --> 30:09.832
<i>but I really like Greek</i>

30:12.120 --> 30:14.475
<i>Charles? Charles?</i>

30:15.920 --> 30:17.797
<i>Are you there?</i>

30:21.560 --> 30:23.357
<i>What's that?</i>

30:23.440 --> 30:25.317
<i>Is that yours?</i>

30:35.080 --> 30:37.594
You wouldn't know the way to
the hockey pitch, would you?

30:37.680 --> 30:40.069
Wargh!

30:47.000 --> 30:48.877
Short corner to St Trinian's.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.435
Go!

31:04.800 --> 31:06.631
You're dead.

31:14.920 --> 31:15.875
Yes!

31:15.960 --> 31:18.952
# Are teenage dreams so hard to beat?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.319
# Every time he walks down the street

31:22.520 --> 31:25.353
# Another boy in my neighbourhood

31:26.200 --> 31:28.760
# Wish he was mine, he looks so good

31:29.440 --> 31:32.034
# I want to hold him, want to hold him tight

31:32.120 --> 31:35.715
# I get teenage kicks right through the night

31:35.800 --> 31:38.030
Geoffrey, where on earth have you been?

31:38.120 --> 31:40.953
You're running quite an exotic
establishment here, Miss Fritton.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.998
- What a lovely thing to say.
- What have they done to you?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.558
I quite agree. The best team did win.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.712
I suppose the lesson is,
don't mess with St Trinian's.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.552
We do play a little rough.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.870
We can all play rough, Camilla.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.554
Maybe we'll be seeing a little more
of one another.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.517
I'll make sure of it.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.275
# I want to hold him, want to hold him tight

32:05.360 --> 32:08.511
# Get teenage kicks right through the night

32:08.600 --> 32:10.158
# All right!

32:51.720 --> 32:52.675
Ah!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.956
Beverly. Beverly.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.677
Ow!

33:07.520 --> 33:10.512
Beverly, would you like to offer
this gentleman something to drink?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.272
Sorry, how rude of me.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.671
I'm... I'm afraid after last night
we've only got Smirnoff.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.399
- Tea, Beverly.
- Or tea.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.199
Yeah, sorry. Tea, tea, tea...

33:23.280 --> 33:26.477
We're not here to drink tea, Miss Fritton.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.757
You owe the bank over £500,000.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.958
Aren't you lucky?
Christmas bonuses all round, I expect.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.794
Because of your decision to ignore
our six previous final demands,

33:37.880 --> 33:41.793
I am forced to serve you with this
foreclosure notice.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.757
<i>Final demand? How can there be
more than one final demand?</i>

33:46.840 --> 33:49.229
<i>Which is the final final demand?</i>

33:49.320 --> 33:51.550
I can't believe you haven't told me about this.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.108
Well, actually, I did try to tell you.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.760
Not now, Bursar. Beverly, where's that tea?

33:56.840 --> 34:01.391
You can't just pull the plug on us,
like some under performing hairdressing salon.

34:01.480 --> 34:05.189
This is an institution of learning, sir,
and I have a duty of care.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.714
I don't answer to you, I answer to my girls.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.710
Girls who find shelter in no other schools.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.393
A bunch of delinquents
and playground terrorists.

34:14.960 --> 34:18.475
One man's terrorist
is another woman's freedom fighter, Mr...

34:20.360 --> 34:21.554
...Bank Manager.

34:21.639 --> 34:26.190
You have four weeks to repay
the outstanding balance...

34:26.280 --> 34:28.271
or this school...

34:28.360 --> 34:30.237
is declared officially bankrupt.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.879
Tea.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.554
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble

34:40.639 --> 34:43.791
# Something's come along
and it's burst our bubble...

34:43.880 --> 34:45.949
Houston, we have a problem.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.149
# Gotta make a dash
for the cash on the double

35:04.400 --> 35:06.072
# The party was great, yeah

35:06.160 --> 35:07.479
# We were really thrilled

35:07.560 --> 35:11.189
# But the bank man came
and we're gonna get killed

35:11.280 --> 35:14.033
# We got some style but we got no money

35:14.120 --> 35:16.509
# Now the joke's on us...

35:16.600 --> 35:18.397
Quiet, everyone!

35:24.840 --> 35:26.876
St Trinian's is closing down.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.992
We're facing the biggest crisis of our lives
and you're behaving like bloody children.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.871
If this place closes down,
we have to go to other schools,

35:43.960 --> 35:46.997
<i>and by that I mean normal schools.</i>

35:49.240 --> 35:51.959
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble

35:52.040 --> 35:55.191
# We're deep in doo-doo
and we don't have a shovel...

35:57.320 --> 35:58.878
Thank you, Matron.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.556
Mm... Oh...

36:04.040 --> 36:06.600
A dark cloud hangs over the school, Beverly.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.671
I know all about that one, Miss Fritton.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.991
Sits on top of me every Monday
when I'm on a comedown.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.911
Do you know what you've got to do?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.833
You gotta get your serotonin levels
back in whack.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.039
Red ones bring you up
and blue ones bring you down.

36:21.120 --> 36:24.192
I believe in a healthy balance.
I'll have one of each.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.952
Thank you.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.315
Mm. Delicious.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.351
- Oh, darling!
- Daddy! I'll get my stuff and we'll go.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.670
- What?
- That's why you're here, isn't it?

36:42.760 --> 36:47.276
No, we'll... talk later, darling. Milla.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.757
Oi.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.312
You might wanna see this.

37:01.360 --> 37:05.239
A boutique hotel?
But this is my school, Carnaby.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.312
The bank's school, Camilla.
And when they shut you down,

37:08.400 --> 37:11.437
you will have lost everything -
and more importantly, so will I.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.355
<i>The good news is live a pal in property</i>

37:17.480 --> 37:19.038
<i>Oh Milla do listen</i>

37:19.760 --> 37:23.469
<i>I think live come up with a solution
that could benefit us both</i>

37:23.560 --> 37:26.597
If we move fast, sell the place now,

37:26.680 --> 37:30.958
we can repay the debt and er... split the profits.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.154
Looks like your old man's
selling us down the river.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.754
No. Daddy wouldn't do anything like that.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.353
<i>What about the girls?</i>

37:38.440 --> 37:40.317
What would happen to my dear girls?

37:41.120 --> 37:44.590
You can stop the Miss Jean Brodie act,
now, Milla. It's me you're talking to.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.429
<i>- What about Annabelle?
- I don't know what to make of that girl</i>

37:49.520 --> 37:51.192
<i>A bit of a drip if you ask me</i>

37:52.040 --> 37:54.395
<i>I sometimes wonder if she's actually mine</i>

37:55.120 --> 37:57.395
Still a daddy's girl, eh?

37:57.480 --> 37:59.277
<i>You're wrong about her Carnaby</i>

37:59.360 --> 38:01.157
<i>In there there's a Fritton</i>

38:01.240 --> 38:05.233
<i>She's got the true family stripe
which is more than I can say about you</i>

38:05.320 --> 38:08.278
<i>- You snake in the grass
- Let's face it little sister</i>

38:08.360 --> 38:10.555
<i>This dump is history</i>

38:11.840 --> 38:13.717
<i>Oh</i>

38:13.800 --> 38:15.791
It's no use relying on the grown -ups.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.711
We need to sort this out ourselves.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.757
Now, the subject of today's lesson is crime.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.910
Yeah? All right? You're liking me now.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.151
<i>So for every need there is a misdeed</i>

38:35.240 --> 38:37.879
And what our need is,
in this particular instance, girls,

38:37.960 --> 38:39.871
is to get our hands on half a bar.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.275
<i>That's half a million pounds for you little ladies</i>

38:42.360 --> 38:44.920
<i>Any ideas? Who's got an idea?</i>

38:45.000 --> 38:46.353
Anyone? Yes?

38:46.440 --> 38:47.953
Shut up! You!

38:48.040 --> 38:51.669
- What about extortion?
- Excellent. Well done.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.236
Yes.

38:53.320 --> 38:56.073
<i>Brilliant Extortion</i>

38:56.160 --> 38:59.550
Now, I know a lot of people think
the old, "Give me your money or else,"

38:59.640 --> 39:03.952
is a bit old hat, but it's a classic,
it's perennial, possible.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.952
<i>Good work Now who else has got any ideas?</i>

39:07.080 --> 39:09.310
- Go on, Celia.
- Confidence trickery.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.675
Confidence trickery. Excellent!

39:11.760 --> 39:13.955
<i>- Credit card fraud.
- Credit card fraud</i>

39:14.040 --> 39:16.600
- Kidnapping, Flash.
- Kidnapping!

39:16.680 --> 39:20.150
That is more like it. Kid... napping!

39:20.800 --> 39:23.553
So, we take a rich man's wife...

39:23.640 --> 39:25.631
- Excellent.
...cut off her ear...

39:25.720 --> 39:27.756
and then send it to him special delivery.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.399
And then... we just keep chopping...

39:34.440 --> 39:36.670
...bits of her off...

39:36.760 --> 39:38.557
...until he pays the ransom.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.552
You shouldn't be laughing at that.
That is too much evil.

39:44.640 --> 39:47.234
You should see a counsellor.
Don't leave her on her own.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.352
Come in, don't loiter in the doorway.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.910
I didn't know you painted, Auntie.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.956
Miss.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.600
Just having a little bit of "me" time.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.600
Once upon a time
I used to think of it as a career.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.193
It's jolly good. Did you sell many paintings?

40:19.320 --> 40:21.595
Not under my own name.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.275
I took it up when I was recovering
from a broken heart.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.954
We Fritton women are made of sturdy stuff

40:30.040 --> 40:33.237
but we do need an emotional outlet,
don't we, dear?

40:33.320 --> 40:35.197
Hit me. Come on, girlie, hit me!

40:35.280 --> 40:37.077
Come on, come on.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.991
- Come on, girlie, girlie!
- I can't!

40:39.080 --> 40:40.911
You can. Let out your frustrations.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.549
Inhale your anger
and let it all out with a good right hook.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.993
Go on.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.832
I see.

40:48.920 --> 40:54.517
Turn your mind to something or someone
who really makes your blood boil. Hm?

40:54.600 --> 40:57.637
A snake in the grass
who betrays his family ties

40:57.720 --> 40:59.790
as easily as he betrays his word.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.637
An unconscionable shit.
A complete and utter...

41:13.320 --> 41:15.197
Oh...

41:16.520 --> 41:18.397
Welcome to the fold, girlie.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.277
Help your old auntie up.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.395
Rah!

41:25.480 --> 41:28.074
Oh, poor girl.
Let's have a whisky.

41:29.200 --> 41:32.590
Come on, ladies, we need to think big.
Open your minds real wide.

41:35.040 --> 41:37.918
You gotta search
for the criminal inside yourself. Yes!

41:40.680 --> 41:41.749
Theft.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.559
Theft. Finally. Now you're talking.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.189
<i>Excellent Theft</i>

41:46.280 --> 41:48.316
- Good work.
- Bank of England?

41:48.400 --> 41:50.038
Bank of England too big.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.509
- Woolworths.
- Too small. Just sweets.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.478
Come on, think about it. I'm telling you...

41:55.560 --> 41:59.155
If you don't use your noggins,
we ain't gonna get this dough together.

42:00.680 --> 42:03.592
I see erm... Yes... Kelly.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.597
What about that?

42:08.440 --> 42:10.112
Oh, my God!

42:10.240 --> 42:13.869
You want to steal Scarlett Johansson?

42:13.960 --> 42:15.837
You are so blonde, Chelsea.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.595
That is one of the most
valuable paintings in the world.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.748
And it is here now.

42:22.840 --> 42:26.071
We steal it and then we fence it.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.435
You'd be able to flog it for us, Flash,
wouldn't you?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.556
Well, erm...

42:36.360 --> 42:38.794
It's probably a bit out of my league, Kel.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.397
Number 7.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.473
The Heist.

42:49.880 --> 42:53.668
Girls, it's time we organised a school trip.

43:01.400 --> 43:05.473
Girls, please. Remember we have
the school's reputation to uphold.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.072
Oi.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.559
Bingo.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.199
Wow.

44:13.320 --> 44:16.198
You can so see why
Colin Firth wanted to shag her.

44:16.840 --> 44:20.753
Yeah, but you could spruce it up with
a dash of colour and some accessories.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.393
I'm thinking, lose the earrings
and go for some big gold hoops.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.672
Ciao-ciao.

44:31.760 --> 44:33.079
- So?
- OK.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.470
<i>They've got 28 CCTV cameras
on separate circuits.</i>

44:36.560 --> 44:41.031
Four shifts of 12 armed guards
patrol the galleries 24 hours a day.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.196
Pressure alarms, invisible random lasers,

44:43.280 --> 44:45.840
and hydraulically-operated
reinforced steel shutters.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.075
Golly!

44:47.160 --> 44:49.628
- So?
- We're talking Mission: Impossible.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.518
- That's a no?
- If Tom Cruise can do it, so can we.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.957
Yeah, yeah, but the real problem is,
how do we get into the building?

44:58.360 --> 45:00.316
<i>We need some kind of cover</i>

45:01.000 --> 45:02.991
Any bright ideas?

45:07.520 --> 45:09.317
So, are we good?

45:09.400 --> 45:13.029
It's such a pity none of you want to give
School Challenge a shot.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.395
It would be so much fun.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.709
I only mention it because
the final takes place right here.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.031
What did you say?
- The final will be televised here.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.437
In the Grand Hall.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.957
The location: Trafalgar Square.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.314
The target: National Gallery.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.118
This is where our trailer base is.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.078
- And the distance?
- 114 metres.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.515
OK, let's get animated.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.913
<i>So here we are -
one of the world's busiest squares</i>

45:50.000 --> 45:52.514
<i>And Big Brother will definitely be watching us</i>

45:52.600 --> 45:54.670
<i>with a surveillance camera on every wall</i>

45:54.760 --> 45:56.876
<i>and security guards at every turn</i>

45:57.000 --> 45:59.958
<i>So we use the trailer as cover
and take the sewers</i>

46:03.320 --> 46:05.515
<i>- Nasty.
- Who's that?</i>

46:07.080 --> 46:09.310
- Ha-ha! Taylor.
- What?

46:09.400 --> 46:11.709
Why me?

46:11.800 --> 46:14.360
I don't know what you're looking
so pleased about, Andrea.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.317
<i>- You're coming as well.
- Shut up!</i>

46:16.400 --> 46:18.675
Me and the Corpse Bride? I don't think so.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.432
Drop the attitude, Taylor.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.351
<i>- Polly
- Now...</i>

46:22.440 --> 46:26.069
When you get in the sewers,
you have to get through these iron gates.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.468
Eugh!

46:39.160 --> 46:41.071
We have double chemistry tomorrow.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.469
We'll start on the explosives.
- Good work.

46:44.320 --> 46:46.959
Once inside, you'll make your way
through to the balcony,

46:47.040 --> 46:48.473
which overlooks the Grand Hall.

46:48.560 --> 46:51.552
Then you take the zip wire over the audience,

46:51.640 --> 46:53.517
while the show is being recorded.

46:56.640 --> 46:58.995
It's like 10 metres high.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.957
<i>113 actually</i>

47:01.520 --> 47:05.559
So after we've got through the rank sewers,
iron gates, security guards...

47:05.640 --> 47:08.871
And then we've done a live wire act
over the audience,

47:09.000 --> 47:12.197
I suppose you want us to swim
the Channel, and then...

47:12.280 --> 47:14.510
- climb a mountain...
...as well!

47:14.600 --> 47:16.989
No. You just have to get through these.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.153
Invisible random lasers

47:23.240 --> 47:27.028
with pressure alarms that trigger
hydraulically-operated steel shutters.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.635
All sounds frightfully exciting, doesn't it?

47:33.720 --> 47:35.472
As for the explosives, girls,

47:35.560 --> 47:37.710
I'd go for RDX rather than Trinitrotoluene.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.360
There's nothing worse than rogue C-4.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.668
Yes, Miss.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.036
<i>But all this will be a complete waste of time
unless we get to the Final</i>

47:45.120 --> 47:46.838
Oh, God, yeah.

47:46.920 --> 47:50.549
So, girls... how do you plan to get us there?

47:53.040 --> 47:55.110
That's not a problem.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.078
<i>Get yourself on camera
and the world can be your oyster</i>

47:58.160 --> 48:01.391
One day you're on School Challenge,
the next it's Love Island.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.074
Soon you've married a footballer
and bought the Bahamas.

48:04.160 --> 48:10.190
But easy, now, girls,
because if you don't take that moment,

48:10.280 --> 48:12.510
blink... and it's back to obscurity.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.317
Oi, girls. Jog on.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.149
- So who...
- JJ French.

48:20.240 --> 48:23.471
Our last Head Girl, now turned PR guru.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.869
People want soap opera.

48:25.960 --> 48:29.077
They want to know how to get your look.
What diet you're on.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.390
They want to know all about your broken hearts

48:31.480 --> 48:33.152
and your fashion disasters.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.754
But keep them talking, that's the game.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.717
That's genius.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.917
Then why isn't everybody famous?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.991
Because they don't have me.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.072
You need to play an angle.

48:49.160 --> 48:52.072
Look at Liz Hurley.
She wore that dress and what happened?

48:52.160 --> 48:54.037
An acting career, her own clothing line

48:54.120 --> 48:56.588
and a 15-page wedding in Hello! magazine.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.954
<i>Now that's genius.</i>

49:00.440 --> 49:03.750
OK, so here's a little tip I learned from Paris.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.956
- Hilton?
- France.

49:08.280 --> 49:12.956
Put on a pair of YSL's and the whole world
will think you're a total brainiac.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.277
You are welcome to join us
on our quizzical quest

49:27.360 --> 49:30.318
to find the brightest of sparks,
the smartest of alecks,

49:30.400 --> 49:32.789
the very pluperfect of pupils

49:32.880 --> 49:36.919
in this year's battle to find
the champions of School Challenge.

49:41.720 --> 49:45.554
<i>On my right in the red corner
we have Ampleforth College</i>

49:45.640 --> 49:50.589
<i>And on my left in the blue corner
it's Peaches Chelsea and Chloe</i>

49:50.680 --> 49:53.990
from St Trinian's!

49:54.120 --> 49:57.908
What term is applied to a restraint
on the expansion of an economy

49:58.000 --> 50:00.594
<i>as a result of governmental taxation policy</i>

50:00.680 --> 50:03.831
<i>whereby a rise in inflation
causes a larger proportion</i>

50:03.920 --> 50:06.832
<i>of wage earners' income to be paid in tax?</i>

50:08.760 --> 50:10.398
Chelsea, St Trinian's.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.674
Fiscal drag.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.397
Fiscal drag is the right answer.

50:14.480 --> 50:16.198
Well done. Five points.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.553
Which Roman poet...

50:20.640 --> 50:22.517
Peaches, St Trinian's.

50:22.600 --> 50:23.953
Ovid.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.996
Ovid is the answer I have on the card.

50:27.440 --> 50:28.634
Who wrote...

50:29.640 --> 50:31.790
Charles Dickens.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.519
...is the right answer. Well, I'm sorry, Ampleforth,

50:34.600 --> 50:37.433
you're up against a team
at the very top of their form.

50:38.760 --> 50:39.875
Quickly.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.874
<i>Which Tchaikovsky overture</i>

50:49.880 --> 50:50.710
1812.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.994
Is the correct answer.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.275
<i>There goes the school bell</i>

50:54.400 --> 50:55.879
<i>with the scores standing at</i>

50:57.320 --> 50:59.709
...which means, I'm sorry to say,
Ampleforth College,

50:59.800 --> 51:01.711
we have to bid farewell to you.

51:01.800 --> 51:04.394
Loser! Loser!

51:04.480 --> 51:05.913
<i>Loser!</i>

51:06.760 --> 51:08.876
So...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.230
how are we going to beat Bedales?

51:13.720 --> 51:15.278
<i>Magic</i>

51:16.760 --> 51:18.796
The kind you get in mushrooms.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.352
<i>- Hi
- Hi.</i>

51:23.440 --> 51:25.510
<i>Anyone for camomile tea?</i>

51:25.600 --> 51:27.477
- Yes.
- Thanks.

51:32.480 --> 51:37.600
In which Shakespeare play would you
find the following stage directions:

51:37.680 --> 51:40.752
"Exit, pursued by a bear"?

51:42.120 --> 51:44.759
Yes. Chas. Bedales.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.957
Was it Winnie the Pooh?

51:49.880 --> 51:50.835
Caspar...

51:52.800 --> 51:55.917
- Are you buzzing, Caspar?
- Oh, yeah.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.553
<i>You've had your chance</i>

51:57.640 --> 52:00.074
You've buzzed... What are you doing?

52:00.160 --> 52:02.355
What are you doing? Chas! I'm being touched.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.476
Derek, I'm being touched. Derek!

52:08.800 --> 52:12.509
Sure, just sign the deal
and I'll make sure she says the brand live on air.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.795
<i>- Apple
- Apple is the right answer</i>

52:15.800 --> 52:18.917
<i>Know-it-all nymphets from St Trinian's</i>

52:20.280 --> 52:23.556
Oh, come on, Eton.
I'm going to have to hurry you.

52:23.680 --> 52:25.557
No, it's gone.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.477
And so has the bell!

52:28.560 --> 52:32.758
And er... on that note, I'm afraid we leave Eton...

52:33.680 --> 52:38.037
...and congratulate our glorious
and glamorous victresses,

52:38.120 --> 52:39.109
<i>who will go on next week</i>

52:39.240 --> 52:42.118
<i>to the grand final to meet
Cheltenham Ladies' College</i>

52:42.200 --> 52:43.838
<i>It is of course St Trinian's</i>

52:51.840 --> 52:53.910
Are we going to close down St Trinian's?

52:55.480 --> 52:57.550
<i>No they're more use to us alive</i>

52:58.600 --> 53:02.673
You see, as things stand,
they're the perfect symbol of misguided youth.

53:02.760 --> 53:05.513
They're a beacon of ill-discipline
in need of correction.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.672
I'm going to make an example of them.
I'll break their spirit.

53:08.800 --> 53:11.075
They will conform.

53:11.160 --> 53:13.435
It's time the world saw
what we've been dealing with.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.954
Show them the problem... then fix it.

53:17.880 --> 53:19.757
The press pack is panting, Peter.

53:20.440 --> 53:22.317
It's time we let them loose.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.039
Hang on.

53:45.120 --> 53:47.588
You want me, a man of my calibre...

53:48.280 --> 53:51.636
...just to... bowl into some gallery in London,

53:52.320 --> 53:54.356
waltz up to your old man

53:54.440 --> 53:56.749
and offer to flog him a Vermeer for half a bar?

53:56.840 --> 53:59.308
It won't be you. It will be this guy.

53:59.400 --> 54:03.473
Gerhard Von Strubel,
the most elusive art dealer in the world.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.317
You want me to pretend to be some...

54:07.400 --> 54:09.072
art bloke?

54:09.160 --> 54:10.639
They've never met,

54:10.760 --> 54:13.354
but my father would do anything
to do business with him.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.635
No, I'm sorry, I don't fancy it. No.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.079
<i>What's wrong?</i>

54:17.160 --> 54:19.037
Not up to it, Flash?

54:19.120 --> 54:20.997
I told you, Annabelle.

54:21.080 --> 54:23.514
Hold on, hold on.
I didn't say I wouldn't do it.

54:23.600 --> 54:26.717
Come on, give us a look at it.
I'll give anything a try once.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.677
So, erm...

54:28.760 --> 54:31.479
What's he like, then, this von Strubel mug?

54:32.280 --> 54:34.271
- He's a count.
- He sounds like one!

54:35.520 --> 54:38.159
No, he's posh. I can do posh, look.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.038
Oh, la-di-dah! Shall we go hunting?

54:41.120 --> 54:43.156
But can you do German?

54:43.240 --> 54:45.913
Yeah, of course I can. Ah, mon freuer...

54:46.000 --> 54:48.753
<i>Strindberg Wiederkind JÃ¼tgen Klinsmann...</i>

54:48.840 --> 54:52.150
It'll be all right on the night.
Just give me a little bit of time.

54:52.240 --> 54:54.196
What's he erm... What's he look like?

54:55.720 --> 54:58.439
Well, all I've heard is that he's successful...

54:58.520 --> 55:00.397
erudite and handsome.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.752
Oh, I almost forgot. He's also very, very gay.

55:10.360 --> 55:12.999
Scramble! Black Eagle, one o'clock!

55:22.800 --> 55:24.916
Ready to make the front pages, Minister?

55:25.040 --> 55:27.759
Peter, the only things
the public wants to read about

55:27.840 --> 55:29.717
are mayhem, misery and disaster.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.837
So we'll be fine.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.310
Thank you for coming, gentlemen, ladies.

55:36.400 --> 55:39.312
What you're about to witness
is the disgraceful result

55:39.400 --> 55:41.470
of 15 years of political indifference.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.957
Schools like this one are weeds.

55:45.040 --> 55:48.589
Long neglected, they've been
allowed to grow wild and unruly.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.558
- And you're the weedkiller, Minister?
- I like it, Denise.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.153
Code Red!

55:53.880 --> 55:55.757
<i>Code Red!</i>

55:58.960 --> 56:01.110
People have often criticised my methods.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.873
They say I'm too aggressive,
hard-line, whatever.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.437
But what I'm about to show you...

56:08.440 --> 56:10.510
...is the appalling alternative.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.795
It looks rather pleasant, if you ask me.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.553
You were only supposed
to blow the bloody doors off.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.157
Minister! Minister?

56:27.800 --> 56:29.677
Code Red!

56:33.800 --> 56:35.677
Morning.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.950
Er... are you lot from t' Inland Revenue?

56:39.040 --> 56:40.917
No.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.109
Phew!

56:43.200 --> 56:44.553
Quickly, quickly.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.478
Ready?

57:14.960 --> 57:18.635
...when the sixth hour was come,
there was a darkness over...

57:19.960 --> 57:21.837
How can I help you?

57:26.880 --> 57:31.158
<i>And some of them stood by
when they heard the saint</i>

57:32.400 --> 57:34.595
They're bound to slip up sooner or later.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.957
Christ! He's coming this way!

57:48.080 --> 57:49.798
We're never gonna make it!

57:58.480 --> 57:59.993
Who are you?

58:01.040 --> 58:02.712
I know your daughter.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.791
You're friends with Verity?

58:04.880 --> 58:06.757
I was at Cheltenham with her.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.591
She was the school bully
and I was one of her favourite victims.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.914
<i>Really?</i>

58:12.000 --> 58:15.151
<i>So Minister your daughter was the school bully</i>

58:17.160 --> 58:19.515
And what's it like being at St Trinian's?

58:19.600 --> 58:21.477
Oh, it's like...

58:22.320 --> 58:26.996
one big, happy...
if slightly dysfunctional... family.

58:27.080 --> 58:29.150
<i>A bastard profanes the English throne</i>

58:30.040 --> 58:32.759
The generous Britons are cheated by a juggler.

58:33.840 --> 58:35.717
<i>Geoffrey What a surprise!</i>

58:40.320 --> 58:41.992
What's going on, Miss Fritton?

58:42.080 --> 58:43.957
The girls are hard at work,

58:44.040 --> 58:46.918
and their headmistress
is rehearsing the role of a lifetime.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.434
Don't you think I make a remarkable queen?

58:49.520 --> 58:52.478
You're up to something,
and I will get to the bottom of it.

58:52.560 --> 58:53.913
I will expose you.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.594
Well, you'll have to at least
buy me dinner first.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.557
Oh, Geoffrey.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.952
Oh, not again.

59:07.240 --> 59:08.355
Aar-rooo!

59:15.160 --> 59:19.438
Not quite the headline we had in mind, Minister.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.597
You've had this coming
since the day you arrived, Fritton.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.511
What are you going to do to me?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.837
Give you a makeover, silly.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.188
# She likes to dress
like she's fresh out of a magazine

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.514
# She struts around
getting down to her record machine

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.116
# It's clear that she enjoys teasing all the boys

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.472
# They always say
that you'll remember her name

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.437
# Because she's got it

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.597
# She's got it right down

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.231
# And all the guys say

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.073
# I need three spoons of sugar
in a glass full of liquor

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.878
# To get over you

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.548
# I'm gonna need a whole lot of therapy
to cure the sugar rush

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.517
# I can't get over you

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.319
# Gimme something in my coffee

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.072
# Gimme thrills, take my money

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.037
# Can't get over you

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.352
So... how do you feel?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.479
Like a St Trinian.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.075
# I need three spoons of sugar
in a glass full of liquor

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.718
# To get over you

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.797
# Gimme something in my coffee

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.552
# Gimme thrills, take my money

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.551
# Can't get over you

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.718
# I'm gonna need a whole lot of therapy
to cure the sugar rush

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.756
# I can't get over you

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.792
Ah, Lavinia.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.713
Are you tempted by our caped crusader?

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.752
Gah! Why is it that the first face I see

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.559
is not only the handsomest face in this room

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.677
but also the very face I came here to talk to?

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.273
It must be fate.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.270
You are?

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.839
German.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.751
Whereabouts in Germany?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.839
Bayern Munich.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.192
That's a football team.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.595
Yes... and I am their number one fan.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.076
Please, don't go. I didn't mean to offend you.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.709
It's just... I get very lonely being German.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.313
And a bigwig in the art world.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.038
- I imagine.
- And gay.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.079
- Would you...
- Ohh!

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.272
Whoopsie-daisy! Gerhard, Gerhard, Gerhard!

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.839
Oh, my God.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.399
You're not Count Gerhard von...

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.357
Sshh, please!

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.908
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:54.752
One of the great masterpieces has just
become available on the black market.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.356
Which masterpiece are you talking about?

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.431
Well, it's actually rather a big deal.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.034
A little out of your league, perhaps.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.997
Perhaps it's something you'd er...

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.638
prefer to discuss over dinner.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.996
What?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.469
Well, you said how... lonely you are.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.678
We could er... spend some time together.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.597
A nice candlelit dinner,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.875
a stroll along the beach...

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.592
...just the two of us...

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.318
...barefoot in the surf.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.792
And then...

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.717
...back to my place.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.669
Or I could just... tell you now.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.990
- Oh, yes, OK.
- Good, it's better.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.712
The masterpiece is the...

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.475
The Girl With The Pearl Earring.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.073
Really?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.956
The ultimate price was paid by one...

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.837
...who laid down his life...

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.150
for his sisters and his school.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.960
No greater love hath any dog...

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.993
...than this.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.037
I'm sorry.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.677
This one's for Mr Darcy!

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.670
On My Way To Satisfaction

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.397
# Hey, yeah, yeah

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.038
# Don't you know I saved a spot for you?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.595
# And I-I-I

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.038
# I wanna introduce you to my crew

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.997
# So what do you say?

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.435
# Am I gonna get my way?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.277
# I don't need your permission

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.388
# You're uptight and it don't look right

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.997
# You've gotta share my vision

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.077
# On my way

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.517
# To satisfaction

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.077
# How I love

# Your reaction

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.997

# Your reaction

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.119
Minister?

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.512
This school you very publicly condemned
is now in the final of School Challenge.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.797
<i>A little embarrassing for your department
is it not? Like to comment?</i>

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.757
No, Denise, I wouldn't.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.355
I'm here in a private capacity
to support my daughter's school.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.317
No more photos now, please, gentlemen.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.197
One question.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.877
Excuse, can I just...

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.678
I'm sorry, you can't go in there.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.159
What? But I...

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.913
The team's going through
some intense preparations.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.389
Eurgh!

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.192
OK. Picture's up.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.512
Tania, what are you doing?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.192
You're 10.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.271
And you're carrying high explosives.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.237
It's not what you think, Kell.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.038
It's for the smell.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.997
We saw it on CSI.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.274
Oh.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.997
Good luck, girls.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.311
- Annabelle?
- Wait for it.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.840
Hello and welcome to no less an institution
than the National Gallery,

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.273
<i>in London itself</i>

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:26.309

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.229
OK. Now.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.354
Girls? Girls, hello.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.229
What's happened?

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.595
Come in, come in. Speak to me.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.711
<i>Oh look</i>

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.031
That was wicked.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.233
OK, girls, let's rock'n'roll.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.518
<i>I love what you've done with the place</i>

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.830
There's no time for this. Concentrate.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.033
Who was burned at the stake for
the crime of wearing men's clothes?

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.357
Peaches. St Trinian's.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.358
Joan of Arc.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.317
Joe Nafark.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.510
Joan of Arc is the right answer.
Five points to St Trinian's.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:53.676
<i>Plenty of time yet ladies from Cheltenham</i>

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.436
OK, it looks like you're clear.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.037
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.519
Speak to me.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.030
What are you doing here?

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.474
We got stuck in the toilet.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.069
We thought our mummy
would come and get us but nobody did.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.037
We were scared.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.997
You're safe now. Come on.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.912
Come on.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:07.628
Which Latin phrase defines
the common -law legal action or writ

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.678
which is the means by which
detainees can seek relief

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.637
from unlawful imprisonment?

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.514
Yes! Chelsea, St Trinian's.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.196
Is it... um...

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.231
I think it might possibly be...

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.637
Um...

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.599
Habeas corpus.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.195
Habeas corpus is the right answer.
They are on fire, Cheltenham.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.516
A great English novel, published in 1813,

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.798
<i>was originally said to be entitled
First Impressions</i>

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.237
<i>It's better known by another title
Can you give me that title please?</i>

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.077
Chelsea. St Trinian's.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.717
<i>Pride and</i>

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.035
Ow!

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.192
That was more painful than a Brazilian wax.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.716
Brazilian wax? Is that your answer?
Pride And Brazilian Wax?

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.234
No! No, um...

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.317
We need more cover.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.995
Medusa.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.674
Medusa is the right answer. Well done.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.910
Jolly good!

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.472
I'm not sure why you're cheering
quite so enthusiastically.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.630
Your school is not doing too well at the moment.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.596
- Go on.
- I don't want to go.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.037
Get out of the way, Morticia.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.350
I'm scared of heights.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.360
OK. I'm coming.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.397
No. One at a time.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.998
Go back.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.477
Come on. Quick.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.996
<i>Now maths How are we on maths girls?</i>

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.640
What is the volume of a sphere?

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.397
Yes, Peaches. You got there first.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.717
Quite loud.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.551
You're barking up the wrong tree there.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.232
<i>Not quite what we mean by "volume"</i>

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.311
<i>Any idea? Jemima yes?</i>

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.075
<i>- Pi R cubed.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.037
<i>- It is Pi R cubed

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.750
I've always been rather good at figures.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.596
<i>Literature Let's see how we do here</i>

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.911
<i>She made her first appearance

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.916
Yes. Chelsea, St Trinian's.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.228
Kylie.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.595
No, it isn't Kylie.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.997
Yes, please, Antonia.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.036
That would be Nana.

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.395
Nana is the right answer.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.917
<i>St Trinian's lagging

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.560
We'll take those scores into school break time.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.992
Milk and buns for us,
hopscotch in the playground for you.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.957
See you later.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.277
This is not happening.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.797
Chelsea! You can't leave!

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.078
You all right, babes?

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.870
I just wonder if I'm wasting myself
doing this platitudinous drivel.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.637
Is this all there is?

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.677
That'll be your serotonin levels.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.637
Here. I've got summat for you.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.791
Red ones bring you up,
blue ones bring you down.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.192
Go for your life.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.518
Oh...

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.550
<i>Wait Chelsea wait</i>

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.677
No way.
There is no way I am going back in there.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.117
- What's wrong, Chelsea?
- Our earpieces have stopped working.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.350
Earpieces?

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.034
That's how we were getting the answers. Unnnh!

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.032
If you walk out now,
this whole thing goes up in smoke.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.790
Every offer we've had
over the last six weeks will vanish.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.479
No more Big Brother. No more Project Catwalk.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.678
No more Celebrity Love Island.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.876
You've been cheating.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.996
Just one moment, Chelsea Parker.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.553
I've been watching you, you little madam...

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.997
...with your girlish wiles and your... saucy ways.

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.355
And now, it seems, your criminal cunning.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.556
You know what you are, don't you?

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.637
A washed-up slapper.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.597
- Smart.
- Huh?

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.671
Smarter than you think.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.637
I am?

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.597
And smart is cool.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.709
- It is?
- Yes.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.677

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.557

Oh, my darling lady girls.
Welcome back, welcome back.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.558
It's the kind of glorious evening,

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.914
<i>It's the kind of evening</i>

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.151

every known numpty in the universe

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.310
and clutch them to your bosom.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.917
Let's get straight down to it.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.831
Let's do it and get straight down to it.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.711
<i>Yes?</i>

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.074
<i>Chloe</i>

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:10.990
Ouagadougou.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.435
Ouagadougou is the right answer.

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.557
Well done, Chloe. Congratulations.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.676
I had a boyfriend from there.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:23.949
<i>Another five points to St Trinian's
This is getting exciting</i>

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.157
Geoffrey!

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.312
You know, when I was in the prison system,

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.595
I encountered some of the country's top felons,

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.911
but your girls really are in a whole other league.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.036
They are the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.758
What did I tell you?

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.159
Don't tell me. Tell it to the judge.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.391
Oh, I've met some hard-boiled men in my time,

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.552
but... you are 20 minutes.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.672
One last drink... for old times' sake?

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.677
I don't think so.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.277
Geoffrey, where did it all go wrong?

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.316
You and I...

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.470
Where did it go wrong?

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.112
Was I...... too fickle, too... fanciful?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.998
Too... much for you?

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.437
Maybe I will have that drink.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:26.237
Down here!

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.397
Wait for me.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.717
Let's dance.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.956
# A new dawn waits for us tonight

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.074
# If you play the cards...
- Come on, focus!

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:07.789
# I swear I'll keep in party line

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.315
# Cross my heart and hope to die

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.310
# If I lose myself to rhythm

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.472
# Doesn't mean I lose control

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.235
# If I can't dance then I don't want

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.869
# Any part of your revolution

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.598
# Revolution

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.757
# Revolution

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.913
You've put me in a very difficult position, Milla.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.470
Whereas on the one hand,
it's my sovereign duty to...

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.875
to turn you in. On. Over.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.235
On the other hand, the second hand. Ticktock.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.037
You're so...

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.111
- So...
- Intelligent?

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.557
Fragrant?

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.150
- Dangerous?
- Odd.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.832
I mean, you always have been.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.590
Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.631
Everyone, we have lift-off!

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.269
I'm sorry, Camilla,
but as you well know, I am a hard...

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.797
I'm a hard...

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.794
What am I? ...liner.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.273
I'm a hardliner,
which means I'm hard and a liner.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.636
Had a dog called Linus once.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.914
Linus!

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.399
Here, boy.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.957
<i>Linus! Here boy!</i>

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.433
<i>Linus!</i>

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.397
I thought the world of that dog.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.637
I loved that dog.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.437
Camilla.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.197
What I'm trying to tell you...

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.030
...is that you...

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.037
you remind me of Linus.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.515
Woof, woof.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.671
Three minutes till the end of the show.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.030
<i>You've gotta get back pronto</i>

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.832
What are you doing?

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.797
I couldn't stay there on my own.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.469
...in Greek mythology, of Hercules...

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.477
- OK, don't panic.
- Panic?

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.034
<i>You can do it - you're nearly there</i>

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:38.951
And I know now
that it's time for the final question.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.553
And looking at the scores...

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.955
<i>- Kelly listen to me
- What am I meant to do?</i>

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.395
Get back now. Right now.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.277
<i>Or we're history</i>

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:52.315
. 140 points. For the first time
in School Challenge we have a tie

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.958
<i>as we go into the final question</i>

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.158
All the sweating, all the heartache,
all the dreams, the hopes, ambitions,

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.878
<i>the revising the swotting</i>

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.316
it's all come down to this moment.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.837
I'm sorry. It's a side effect
of my raisin and Ryvita diet.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.230
Contrary to popular opinion, better in than out.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.197
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.840
the final question - the decider.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.077
Fingers on buzzers.
Which substance is believed to have

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.993
<i>such strong aphrodisiac properties</i>

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.992
that the Aztecs forbade women

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.798
from consuming it.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.757
Thwaites Junior is onto us.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.754
<i>She'll blow the whole thing -
we've got to stop her</i>

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.037
- I'll handle this.
- But, Annabelle...

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.071
- Annabelle.
- She's mine.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.673
<i>Annabelle come in!</i>

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.197
Chelsea, St Trinian's.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.632
Thwaites.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.508
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to bring you down, Fritton.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.148
You and your vulgar little school.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.592
I have to hurry you, Chelsea.
If you buzz you must answer straightaway.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.314
Is it chocolate?

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.717
You do know I'm faster than you.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.917
<i>Annabelle? Annabelle come in</i>

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.032
<i>Annabelle</i>

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.669
Urgh!

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.797
Chocolate? Is that your answer?

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.757
Er...

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.838
Yes, it is.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.958
Time for a little prayer.

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.596
Is the right answer!

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.272
Yes!

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.158
Which means this year's champions
are St Trinian's School.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.877
I'm so happy.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:29.274
Yes! Yes!

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.309
Yes, Bursar!

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.397
Yeah!

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.956
Camilla, erm...

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.474
Last night, what happened?
I don't remember anything.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.790
I'm sorry, Geoffrey.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.670
I'm afraid I had to slip you a little something.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.751
And then...

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.558
you returned the favour.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.759
Oh, God, you didn't, did you?

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.877
<i>Well not exactly</i>

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:30.350
- Now, listen, Camilla, I can't...
- Oh, shut up, Geoffrey.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.317
Just kiss me.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:48.317
# Love is a many splendoured thing

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:59.753
# It's the April rose
that only grows in the early spring

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.197
What the?

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.711
What took you so long?

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:23.870
More now on that breaking news story.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.951
In an extraordinary turn of events,

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.828
the priceless painting that was stolen
last night from the National Gallery

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.672
has been recovered.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.637
<i>Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring</i>

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.713
was found by a group of schoolgirls
in a changing room of Harvey Nichols.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.233
We can go live now to St Trinian's School

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.231
where our reporter Denise Stephenson

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.788
is with the chairman of the National Gallery

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.791
waiting to give the girls a reward.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.950
It gives me great pleasure to present this award

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.393
to the girls of St Trinian's

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.990
who are model citizens,
an example to young people everywhere.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.957
And here they are now.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.596
How does it feel to be a role model?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.593
We've been unable to contact
Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites...

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.472
- There he is!
- He's up there.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.551
Come on, Minister.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.957
# We can't fake the way we feel

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.838
# We were born to keep it real

# You bite us, we'll bite you back

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.312
# Better be scared when we attack

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.472
# Feel the fear, we're maniacs

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:46.233

There's something about you tonight, Camilla.

# Love is in the air

Yes, it is Geoffrey.

# Don't know if I feel sane
- You're utterly bonkers.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.519
# But it's something that I must believe in

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.398
# And it's there when you call out my name

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.357
Oh, Geoffrey!

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.917
# Love is in the air

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:27.717
# Love is in the air

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:31.918
# Whoa-whoa-whoa
- Geoffrey!

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.151
- Do it again.
# Whoa-whoa-whoa

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.117
You love it, you saucy minx.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.795
Fame Academy, here we come.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.757
# Love is in the air

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.271
# In the rising of the sun

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.277
# Love is in the air

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.395
# When the day is nearly done

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.673
# And I don't know if you're an illusion
- I'm here, Camilla.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.558
# I don't know if I see it true

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.153
# But you're something that I must believe in

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.395
# And you're there when I reach out for you

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.152
Not there, please, Geoffrey.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.117
# Love is in the air

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.556
# Everywhere I look around

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:20.597
# Love is in the air

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.954
# Every sight and every sound
- Geoffrey!

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.639
# And I don't know if I'm being foolish

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.555
# Don't know if I'm being wise

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.712
# But it's something that I must believe in

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.512
# And it's there when I look in your eyes

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.032
- More rhythm.
- Slow down, Camilla.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.350
For God's sake, slow down.
Give a man a chance.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.874
Give it more rhythm, more rhythm. Go on. Go on!

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.757
# Love is in the air

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.751
# Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo!

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.558
# Love is in the air

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.517
# Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo!

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.876
I love it when you look at me like that.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.951
Come on, Geoffrey, let's not ruin the chorus.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.998
- Here we go. One, two...
- One, two...

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.752
One, two, three, four!

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:09.671
# Love is in the air

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.591
# Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo!

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:13.511
# Love is in the air

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.477
# Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo!

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.477
# Love is in the air

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.437
# Love is in the air
