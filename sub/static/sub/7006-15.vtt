WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:06.832
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.931
ls everyone as excited
about today as l am?

00:09.009 --> 00:13.105
Oh, yeah. l'm going to the dentist
to get my teeth scraped.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.545
<i>Swedish guys are coming by Tool Time?</i>

00:15.615 --> 00:16.980
<i>Ja!</i>

00:18.218 --> 00:19.742
And if they like what they see,

00:19.819 --> 00:22.379
they're gonna distribute the show
throughout Europe.

00:22.489 --> 00:25.424
You could be looking
at the new international tool sensation.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.154
<i>Are you sure they'll
understand Tool Time in Europe?</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:31.356
Yeah, l mean,
they barely understand it here.

00:32.365 --> 00:37.268
Yeah? Let me give you two words
to think about: Jerry Lewis.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.670
Europeans like him
'cause he acts like a complete buffoon.

00:41.241 --> 00:45.678
- We're gonna be rich!
- [Jill laughs]

00:45.745 --> 00:47.770
Oh, you guys scoff.

00:47.847 --> 00:52.079
This episode will blow those Swedes
right out of their Volvos.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.916
lt's a whole salute to men:
men and their hobbies,

00:54.988 --> 00:57.320
men's gadgets, a man's gym.

00:57.390 --> 01:01.292
And what about the European women?
What's in it for them?

01:01.361 --> 01:03.386
Same thing in it for the American women.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.760
Al?

01:08.201 --> 01:11.728
lf the show's a big hit in Europe, does
that mean we finally get to go there?

01:11.805 --> 01:15.070
Yeah! We can go to England
and visit the Aston Martin factory.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.302
ltaly, the Ferrari plant.

01:17.377 --> 01:20.505
A romantic weekend in Stuttgart
at the Porsche factory.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.281
That's about as romantic
as touring a sausage factory.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.114
We can do that too. On the way home,
we'll swing by Poland.

[Tim grunts]

02:14.267 --> 02:15.734
[Tim grunts]

02:31.684 --> 02:33.652
Hey. Hey!

02:34.621 --> 02:37.784
Good morning, Tim.
Yeah, l'll... l'll take that.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.121
- Morning, Fred. Ooh, boy!
- Yeah.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.559
- Are the Swedish guys here?
- Uh, the Swedish guys.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.186
- Any minute.
- You think?

02:44.264 --> 02:48.633
- You're the producer of the show?
- Uh, yeah! Unless you know something.

02:49.769 --> 02:52.101
lt's 30 degrees out here.
Why are you sweating?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.606
Oh. [stammering]
l'm sorry. l'll try to stop.

02:59.345 --> 03:03.111
Tim, your idea for today's show
is one of your best.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.683
Possibly the best ever.

03:04.751 --> 03:08.278
Would it embarrass you
if l used the word ''genius''?

03:08.354 --> 03:10.584
Wait. Your contract's up
at the end of the month?

03:10.657 --> 03:12.284
This month. Uh, yeah.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.849
Can you put in a word
for me with Binford?

03:14.928 --> 03:18.625
- l'll put in two words: ''kiss up.''
- [laughs]

03:18.698 --> 03:20.063
- Al.
- Hey, Tim. Fred.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.964
Excited about the show?
lt's a big one.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.493
Al Borland is gonna
take Europe by storm!

03:25.572 --> 03:27.403
Uh...

03:27.473 --> 03:31.705
Hey, Al. You might want to remove
the toilet paper from your shoe.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.746
l'll get it. Here, Al. Let me help you.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.280
[stammering] Here.
l'll do it. There we go.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.782
Thank you, Fred.

03:37.850 --> 03:41.616
Wilson, thank you very much
for being a guest on today's show.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.852
Oh, Tim, it's my pleasure. You know,
l have many relatives living in Sweden.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.019
They're gonna be
so thrilled to see me on TV.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.694
Some of them have never seen my face.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.234
l can't wait to surprise
my Uncle Nielson Wilson.

03:58.705 --> 04:03.472
<i>Nielson Wilson? l know him!
ln Stockholm he's a barrel maker,ja?</i>

04:03.576 --> 04:07.637
[speaking Swedish]

04:10.049 --> 04:11.676
Excuse me, guys. Excuse me?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.720
Hey! Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.

04:14.787 --> 04:19.053
Bjorn ''The Swede That's
Gonna Buy My Show'' Larson.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.024
Uh, Wayne, Wayne.
Come on in for a minute.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.324
This is one of the men
coming to look at the show.

04:23.396 --> 04:27.025
Take him around. Give him anything he
wants. Keep him away from my bagels.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.261
- Fred, Fred, wait!
- Yeah? What's up, boss?

04:29.369 --> 04:32.827
- Uh, l have not seen the Andrettis yet.
- Uh...

04:32.905 --> 04:35.669
- They're on the show, right?
- Uh, no.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.141
They had to cancel
because they have the flu.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.576
How long have you known?

04:39.646 --> 04:43.082
What's the longest l could know
without getting in trouble?

04:43.149 --> 04:46.585
We're supposed to have celebrities.
The Andrettis. You promised.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.348
l'm sorry. l feel awful about this.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.151
Fred, Fred. Um... um... um... um,

04:51.224 --> 04:53.283
isn't Paul Newman
in town on a charity thing?

04:53.359 --> 04:56.260
- You know Paul Newman?
- You're supposed to know Paul Newman!

04:56.329 --> 04:58.263
Sorry. You're right. Don't worry.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.697
Listen, l got a lot of great ideas
for backup guests.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.735
Oh! Hey! You know who would be great?
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.534
- Yes! You know him?
- No, but he'd be great.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.042
[theme song plays]

05:18.284 --> 05:22.152
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- [crowd] Tool Time!</i>

05:22.221 --> 05:26.715
That's right! Binford Tools is proud to
present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor! Whoo!

05:26.793 --> 05:28.761
[applause]

05:30.363 --> 05:32.923
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, Heidi.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.261
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:38.430
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor. And
you all know my assistant, Al Borland.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.870
[cheering]

05:42.975 --> 05:45.102
Well, we have
a very big show for you today.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.147
- Yes, we do.
- We're doing our annual salute...

05:48.247 --> 05:50.681
- [belch sound effect]
- [chuckles]

05:50.750 --> 05:53.241
...to men.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.447
We're guys with flies. [grunts]

05:56.522 --> 05:59.389
We like our beer out of a bottle.
[grunting]

05:59.459 --> 06:02.189
Our chili out of a can! [grunting]

06:03.796 --> 06:05.764
But there's nothing we like better

06:05.832 --> 06:09.063
than smoked Swedish salmon
with a little juniper on there, huh?

06:09.135 --> 06:11.160
Or is it called ''yuniper?''

06:13.573 --> 06:16.235
As Tim said,
we have a big show for you today.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.140
But we're gonna start off simple

06:18.211 --> 06:21.544
by showing you how
to build these walnut valets.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.878
Walnut valets? Someone
to park your nuts...?

06:23.950 --> 06:26.919
You park your pants... right here.

06:27.019 --> 06:30.978
And you hang the coat right there. And
it's all ready for you in the morning.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.718
What's ready for us now
is our side rails and our dowels.

06:33.793 --> 06:37.160
That's right. l'm gonna start off
by shaping our shoulder bar

06:37.263 --> 06:38.992
with the scroll saw.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.860
After Al's done with that,

06:41.934 --> 06:44.835
we'll be shaping that shoulder bar
in this steamer box.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.135
Get it into the right shape
for us for our final preparations.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.077
OK.

06:53.146 --> 06:57.014
Now, notice my wide, rounded curves.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.656
We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford.

07:08.995 --> 07:12.726
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time. Al's shoulder
piece is not quite ready in the steamer.</i>

07:12.799 --> 07:15.927
But the clams are close. Mmm-mm-mm!

07:17.703 --> 07:18.863
Ooh, it's hot in there!

07:18.938 --> 07:22.840
Now it's time to move on to a segment
of the show we call Man at His Leisure.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.742
Today we're gonna show you
an outdoor leisure activity

07:25.812 --> 07:28.940
that's recently been brought inside:
rock climbing.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.974
And to tell us more about it is expert
rock climber, Wilson Wilson, Junior.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.384
Hidy-ho, neighbor!

07:36.456 --> 07:38.219
- Thanks for dropping in.
- Mm-hm.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.350
Pretty complicated looking equipment.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.587
- Am l gonna get to try this?
- Yes, indeedy, Tim.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.823
Now, what l'm going to do is
to take this rope which is attached

07:45.898 --> 07:50.961
to your harness by means
of a device we call the carabiner.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.698
They use these things in sailing.

07:52.772 --> 07:56.731
Out there they gotta watch out
for the Pirates of the Carabiner.

07:58.511 --> 08:03.039
Now, Tim, as you climb,
make sure your hands and your toes

08:03.115 --> 08:05.345
are securely on your holes.

08:05.418 --> 08:09.252
And propel yourself upwards
by using your legs thusly.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.427
OK, now l'm gonna
take up the slack here, Tim.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.826
Now, l have got you.
Nothing can happen.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.831
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah. Climb on.

08:19.899 --> 08:24.461
While Tim's climbing, tell us something
about your rock-climbing experiences.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.869
Well, one of my favorites
was when l was a ranger

08:26.939 --> 08:28.463
working on Mount Rushmore

08:28.541 --> 08:32.409
and l was attempting
to climb Abraham Lincoln's upper lip.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.640
Well, l faltered.
But, luckily, l was able to save myself

08:35.715 --> 08:38.775
by gaining a toehold on his wart.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.154
Boy, this is a lot of fun, Wilson!
Can l get a little more rope?

08:45.224 --> 08:48.250
[Al] Well, Tim, you don't want
to go too far off to the side.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.659
You don't want
to get above your anchor.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.630
Al's right, Tim. Should you let go...

08:52.698 --> 08:55.030
Let go? [screaming]

08:56.035 --> 08:59.471
We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford Tools.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.034
Ouch! What happened out there?
l almost killed myself.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.342
- What was that camera doing?
- Taping the show.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.177
l had nothing to do with it.

09:10.283 --> 09:13.150
Nice to have a producer
who has ''nothing to do with the show.''

09:13.219 --> 09:15.983
[chuckling] God, what a guy!

09:16.055 --> 09:17.522
Why are you laughing?

09:17.590 --> 09:20.423
The Swedes aren't finding this amusing.
We're dying.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.155
No. Don't worry. The Swedes
are gonna love Gadget Corner.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.288
Yeah? lf they don't, l'm blaming you.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.832
As you should, my friend.
[laughs] As you should.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.366
- Hi.
- Hey, Warren, Warren, Warren.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.995
- What?
- You build that gadget?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.905
- lt's not gonna work.
- Did you build it to my specifications?

09:35.975 --> 09:38.443
That's why l'm sure
it's not gonna work.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.247
Here's another gadget
for the travelin' man.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.808
A satellite dish in a suitcase.

09:46.886 --> 09:50.617
Wow! lt's got the little satellite phone
over there, satellite dish.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.659
You know,
Al's mom has a satellite chafing dish.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.123
Well, what else
do you have to show us, June?

09:58.197 --> 10:01.257
This is a golf club

10:01.334 --> 10:03.962
drink dispenser. [laughs]

10:04.036 --> 10:07.472
Oh. Great for bringing along
my favorite drink: golf club soda.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.633
[laughs, snorts]

10:10.242 --> 10:12.972
But be sure you
have a designated driver.

10:16.482 --> 10:20.976
You know, l hate
to wedge myself between you two,

10:21.053 --> 10:23.613
but, uh, tell us about this
little stocking stuffer.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.453
This is an automatic waffle maker.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.653
lt releases the batter
onto this griddle

10:29.729 --> 10:32.857
and sends the waffles
down the conveyor belt

10:32.932 --> 10:37.266
where they come out
right here... golden brown.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.703
That's great, because l have designed
a high-powered syrup dispenser

10:40.806 --> 10:43.741
to go along with this.
Heidi, my Waffle Buddy, please.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.242
Oh, no. Tim's made his own gadget.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.180
Code red.
This is what we trained for, people. Go.

10:50.249 --> 10:54.811
All right. This is CO2-powered,
25 PSl...

10:54.920 --> 10:57.889
Yeah. Put the fire department
and the paramedics on hold.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.053
Now, watch this thing. All you do...

11:01.127 --> 11:03.823
lt dispenses butter, syrup
and, for our Swedish friends,

11:03.896 --> 11:07.354
lingonberry jam at the touch
of a button. Just press here.

11:09.635 --> 11:12.604
There seems
to be a little jam in my jam.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.201
Shake it a little bit...

11:18.611 --> 11:20.579
- l got it working now.
- Yes, it is! Tim!

11:30.222 --> 11:31.985
Oh, no.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.731
[woman] Guys, we're back in 1 5.
Stand by.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.431
Fred, we're losing these Swedes.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.871
The celebrity has to go
through the roof. Get somebody?

11:48.974 --> 11:50.908
- l got somebody great.
- Big name?

11:50.976 --> 11:52.739
- lt's a long name.
- What?

11:52.812 --> 11:53.779
[woman] Stand by.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.245
Here's his bio.
He's kind of an unsung hero.

11:56.348 --> 11:57.474
- Here we go.
- Gotta go.

11:57.550 --> 12:01.008
- Fred, Fred, Fred, Fred!
- [woman] Five, four, three...

12:02.455 --> 12:04.980
<i>Ha-ha. Welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

12:05.057 --> 12:07.958
Every now and then we have
a segment we call The Unsung Hero.

12:08.027 --> 12:12.862
Well, today's guest is just that.
His name is Seymour Wonderfleffin.

12:12.932 --> 12:17.301
<i>And, uh... So, Seymour... Let's give
a big Tool Time welcome for Sy!</i>

12:29.048 --> 12:33.007
- Uh, welcome to the show, Sy.
- Pleasure to be here, Tim.

12:33.119 --> 12:36.088
Sy works at, um...

12:36.155 --> 12:38.419
...the Department of Animal Control.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.057
So, are you the top dog? [chuckles]

12:44.230 --> 12:46.198
The fat cat?

12:46.298 --> 12:50.166
No, l'm just a regular guy who
scrapes dead animals off the highway.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.372
Well, uh, why don't you tell us
a little bit about what you do?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.173
A very little bit. [laughs]

13:00.246 --> 13:02.612
Well, l get up
about 7 am and drive around

13:02.681 --> 13:05.241
and, uh, pick up dead animals
with a shovel.

13:08.754 --> 13:12.246
But at the Department of Animal Control,
there must be some neat equipment,

13:12.324 --> 13:16.055
- a special shovel you use?
- No, no, no. Just a shovel.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.596
Found it by the side
of the road last year.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.689
Before that,
l didn't even have a shovel.

13:22.802 --> 13:27.171
What would be a really good day
for you on a job like this?

13:27.273 --> 13:31.642
Well, uh, one time l had
an eight-possum Thursday.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.445
Yeah. Well, how could you
beat a day like that, huh?

13:37.516 --> 13:39.177
Didn't think l could. One Tuesday,

13:39.251 --> 13:42.880
the good Lord blessed me
with 1 2 raccoons and a skunk.

13:48.527 --> 13:52.463
We... we were hoping to have
Paul Newman on the show today.

13:52.531 --> 13:55.022
<i>Paul Newman? Cool Hand Luke, man!</i>

13:55.100 --> 13:57.193
ln that movie he had a great shovel.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.599
You don't get out a lot, do you, Sy?

14:03.475 --> 14:06.774
- Well, uh, do you have any hobbies?
- Hobbies, yeah.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.904
Well, l like to paint.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.210
Paint? What do you like to paint, Sy?

14:10.282 --> 14:12.182
Uh, still life.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.286
All right, Sy.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.924
Well, if you think scraping dead animals
off the road is a workout,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.298
wait till you see our next segment.
We'll be back.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.927
[applause]

14:37.343 --> 14:39.174
- Fred?
- Mm-hm? Mm-hm?

14:40.212 --> 14:41.907
- You can read, can't you?
- Yeah...

14:41.981 --> 14:43.881
Fred, this show is a disaster.

14:43.949 --> 14:47.077
Those Swedes are probably on a plane
back to Lingonberry Land now.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.484
No, they're still here.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.579
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.385
Any indication they enjoy the show?

14:52.458 --> 14:56.155
Well, l think
it's a fair assessment that, um...

14:56.228 --> 14:57.661
- High probability...
- Fred?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.494
They're still here.
Let's just hang onto that.

15:01.133 --> 15:04.102
Keep them in the building.
lf anything'll bring them around,

15:04.169 --> 15:06.899
- it'll be the segment on the Man's Gym.
- Man's Gym. Right.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.234
Hey!

15:08.307 --> 15:11.799
Thanks for having me on your show.
l brought you a present.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.347
- Hey, Fred!
- [Fred] Yeah?

15:23.422 --> 15:27.449
- Had your lunch?
- Oh, hey. Hey, thanks!

15:30.462 --> 15:32.953
Hi. Welcome back.
We've talked about a man's work.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.092
Now it's time to talk
about a man's workout.

15:36.168 --> 15:40.730
Welcome to the Binford 61 00 Man's Gym!

15:50.783 --> 15:55.049
All right. Let's start out here
at the multi-purpose workout center.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.420
lt's where you get your bi's, tri's
and thighs... up to size.

15:59.491 --> 16:03.120
This unit has features
you'll only find in the Man's Gym.

16:03.195 --> 16:06.358
Tired of sitting on a hard bench,
you just press ''number one.''

16:10.903 --> 16:14.669
lt's so cozy, l could snooze right now.
[sighing]

16:16.642 --> 16:20.009
You may be wondering if you're gonna
take a snooze, how do you exercise?

16:20.112 --> 16:22.342
Just press ''automatic''...

16:27.753 --> 16:30.381
...and the machine
does the workout for you.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.721
Now, if the machine's doing all
the work, how do you work up a sweat?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.261
Easy. We got sweat in this one.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.201
We got cold beer over here.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.999
That would be the sweat!

16:53.078 --> 16:55.444
All right, moving on...

17:03.589 --> 17:06.022
All right, who hasn't been
in the middle of a workout

17:06.090 --> 17:09.583
- when nature comes a-callin'?
- ln the Man's Gym...

17:10.662 --> 17:14.223
ln the Man's Gym, you don't have to
drop your workout to drop your drawers.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.164
Just row as you go.

17:19.805 --> 17:24.037
No need to lift the seat in the
Man's Gym, l'll tell you that right now.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.567
- How about a little refreshment, Al?
- Let's go to the bars.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.978
The Man's Health Bar.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.314
Two Man's Gym Specials, Milt.

17:39.525 --> 17:43.052
Ah. Here's to your health.
Nothing healthier than Swedish vodka.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.632
Unless, of course,
it's a Swedish massage.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.427
How about a little back rub, Milt?

17:51.503 --> 17:53.596
l don't go for that sort of thing!

17:55.707 --> 17:57.334
But Helga does.

18:06.051 --> 18:09.885
Oh... Oh, l love my job.

18:10.823 --> 18:15.123
Well, it's time for a different
sort of cardiovascular exercise.

18:15.194 --> 18:18.857
Uh, by the way,
this happens to be the Man's Steam Room.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.900
[man] There's a draft! Close the door!

18:25.237 --> 18:29.606
Well, nothing gets the heart pumping
faster than the Man's Exercise Bike.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.144
ln the Man's Gym, we don't use
an ordinary exercise bike.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.770
We use one of these.

18:36.348 --> 18:39.647
That's right. This can be set
to many different levels.

18:42.588 --> 18:46.456
Beginning rider, expert rider...

18:46.859 --> 18:50.625
And if you're tired of pedaling
altogether, we got Easy Rider.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.162
[engine starts]

18:54.800 --> 18:56.734
[crashing]

19:00.239 --> 19:02.799
- Good show. Good night.
- Yeah. Good show, guys.

19:03.942 --> 19:08.709
Hey, Tim! Tim, the Man's Gym sequence
was incredible. l have chills.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.305
Fred is right. l think
that the rowing-machine toilet

19:11.383 --> 19:14.079
made a big splash with the Swedes!

19:15.053 --> 19:17.681
Not sure anything made up
for the lingonberry accident

19:17.756 --> 19:19.781
and the Animal Control guy.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.019
l'm sorry... Oh, listen.
Here come the Swedes.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.789
They must've made their decision.

19:23.862 --> 19:27.093
All l want to say is no matter
what happens, the most important thing

19:27.166 --> 19:31.398
is... is that
we stick together. Please?!

19:33.372 --> 19:39.333
Gentlemen, after much thought
and many changes of clothes,

19:39.444 --> 19:42.004
we have decided

19:42.080 --> 19:44.173
<i>- to buy Tool Time.
- Yes!</i>

19:44.249 --> 19:47.616
- All right! [laughs]
- Thank you very much.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.519
So was it the Man's Gym
that put you over the top?

19:50.589 --> 19:55.492
Oh, no. We liked the whole show.
ln Sweden, we love slapstick comedy.

19:55.561 --> 19:58.724
You are the next Jerry Lewis.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.467
''Hey, Dean!''

20:04.069 --> 20:06.799
Guys, that calls for a celebration.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.035
l tell you what. We work
awful darn hard on this show...

20:20.018 --> 20:22.077
Hey, guys. l got the mail.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.214
There's a package from Sweden.
You know what that means?

20:25.290 --> 20:27.520
You won the Nobel Prize again?

20:31.697 --> 20:35.394
<i>Got my first Tool Time show
dubbed in Swedish.</i>

20:35.467 --> 20:39.927
- And... our first check.
- Oh.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.495
Cool! How much did they pay you?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.940
Well, if it's any of your business,
which it's not,

20:45.010 --> 20:47.706
it's 1 ,500 kroners.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.482
Wow! How much
is that in American money?

20:52.551 --> 20:55.918
$22.83.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.481
That's it?

20:58.557 --> 21:01.526
Wait until the money
starts rolling in from Lapland.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.297
<i>[speaking Swedish]</i>

21:23.782 --> 21:27.411
You know, l never understood that joke
till l heard it in Swedish.

21:30.022 --> 21:34.288
This is so weird.
lt doesn't sound anything like you.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.253
<i>[man screaming]</i>

21:37.329 --> 21:39.297
That sounds like you.

21:42.668 --> 21:46.035
Yee-ha! Sailor Seymour Wonderfleffin.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.464
But, uh, working
at the Department of Animal Control,

21:50.542 --> 21:53.375
you have a special-handled hammer
with a lot of attachments.

21:53.445 --> 21:56.278
- [woman] Hammer?
- No. l have a shovel, Tim.

21:56.348 --> 21:59.613
l could hear that from here. A shovel!

21:59.685 --> 22:01.778
- Actually, l use a shovel.
- Not a hammer.

22:01.853 --> 22:05.118
l tried hammering 'em off the road
for a while. But it just didn't work.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.492
You work at Department
of Animal Control.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.755
So, you probably have
a special-handled, uh... um... um...

22:11.463 --> 22:13.192
- Shovel, Tim.
- Shovel.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.426
- Handled hammer.
- l dare to use a shovel.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.660
Shovel. Yeah.
