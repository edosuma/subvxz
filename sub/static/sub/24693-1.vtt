00:00.939 --> 00:03.510
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.510 --> 00:06.595
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.595 --> 00:08.526
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.526 --> 00:10.611
These are their stories.

00:15.328 --> 00:18.072
Hey, Kevin, Matt's first T-ball game.

00:18.072 --> 00:19.638
Check it out.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.644
Not bad for a three-year old.

00:23.644 --> 00:25.933
Except he ran to third, instead of first.

00:25.933 --> 00:28.598
Ass backward, like his old man.

00:31.747 --> 00:33.702
Call in a bathroom break for me.

00:33.702 --> 00:34.983
I'll be back in a few.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.679
Nancy calls me yesterday,

00:37.679 --> 00:41.945
she got home early from work
and found Jeremy in bed with a girl.

00:41.945 --> 00:45.052
She wants me to talk to him.
The kid's 15 years old.

00:45.052 --> 00:46.924
What am I supposed to say?

00:46.924 --> 00:50.000
How about,
"have you got any pointers?"

00:52.092 --> 00:53.726
That's a good one.

00:55.507 --> 00:58.315
You in? You in? Come on.
Let's go.

00:59.744 --> 01:02.264
PG-13.

01:02.264 --> 01:05.868
There's worse things the kid could be doing
than watching Spiderman.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.396
I have off tomorrow.
If it makes you feel better,

01:09.396 --> 01:11.055
I'll watch it with him.

01:11.376 --> 01:13.364
Now get some sleep.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.188
I love you.

01:15.585 --> 01:17.093
Good night.

01:23.670 --> 01:27.311
Oh, no... / For crying out loud,
tell her it's the last hand.

01:27.819 --> 01:29.612
It's not her. It's one P-P.

01:29.612 --> 01:31.126
What's up?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.894 --> 01:54.388
We're transporting him
to Starch memorial hospital.

01:54.388 --> 01:55.683
Get 'em ready.

01:56.213 --> 01:57.630
Please hang on.

01:59.388 --> 02:02.548
No. Eames, no.

02:02.548 --> 02:05.327
It's right that you called, okay?
I'll meet you there.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.413
Trauma one.
Call anesthesia.

02:08.413 --> 02:10.779
Get a collar on him. Stat.
I want two large four IVs.

02:10.779 --> 02:12.216
Type and cross for four units.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.337
Let's clear some room.

02:13.337 --> 02:15.043
Let's clear some room, people.

02:15.355 --> 02:17.309
- The commissioner is en route.
- What's being done?

02:17.309 --> 02:19.448
Tell him there's canvassing going on.

02:19.448 --> 02:20.688
Get your CI's working.

02:20.688 --> 02:22.303
- Does he have any family?
- Easy, easy.

02:22.303 --> 02:24.596
Got a wife and an eight year-old son.
She's on the way.

02:24.596 --> 02:25.985
What the hell happened?

02:25.985 --> 02:28.709
Detective Quinn, seated in the driver's side
of his unmarked car,

02:28.709 --> 02:29.929
took two bullets to the head.

02:29.929 --> 02:31.956
Quinn? Kevin Quinn?

02:31.956 --> 02:33.368
Do you know him?

02:33.959 --> 02:36.022
He was my husband's partner...

02:37.578 --> 02:39.853
The night Joe was murdered.

03:31.688 --> 03:33.652
What was their detail?

03:34.202 --> 03:37.606
They were posted at 106 street
in Jamaica protecting a witness

03:37.606 --> 03:39.820
in an upcoming drug trial.

03:40.358 --> 03:41.993
Uh, was the partner in the car?

03:41.993 --> 03:43.604
You still have two weeks personal leave.

03:43.604 --> 03:45.428
Yeah. Doesn't Matter.
A cop's been shot.

03:45.428 --> 03:46.693
Murdered.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.420
Quinn? This is the same...

03:48.420 --> 03:49.874
Yeah.

03:50.508 --> 03:51.429
He was alone.

03:51.429 --> 03:54.269
That's why the chief of D's
wants Major Case to take the lead.

03:54.269 --> 03:55.477
Come here.

03:56.395 --> 04:00.611
Detective Copa, these are
Detectives Goren and Eames.

04:00.611 --> 04:03.215
We're sorry about your partner.

04:04.882 --> 04:08.685
So where were you
when Quinn was killed?

04:08.905 --> 04:10.536
Bathroom break.

04:11.410 --> 04:14.048
On my way back, I heard the first shot.

04:14.445 --> 04:16.310
I run to the car,

04:16.783 --> 04:21.345
I see this short asian guy at the driver's side
firing the second shot.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.805
So...

04:22.805 --> 04:25.634
You were close enough
to see his face.

04:25.634 --> 04:28.417
Sure. About 20 feet.

04:28.628 --> 04:32.504
When you can, we want you
to go back there with us.

04:33.463 --> 04:35.034
I'll change.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.965
Avoiding eye contact.

04:41.965 --> 04:43.984
Did he call in his bathroom break?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.888
At 1:40.

04:46.110 --> 04:48.948
What time was his ten-thirteen logged?

04:49.239 --> 04:50.853
Theresa!

05:07.307 --> 05:10.724
Killer was very brazen.
Just shot him right through his window.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.508
No strays.

05:12.508 --> 05:14.220
Good aim.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.287
- Calm nerves.
- Quinn...

05:18.595 --> 05:20.621
He didn't even get a shot off.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.911
His gun was holstered.

05:22.911 --> 05:24.763
How did the killer surprise him?

05:24.763 --> 05:27.554
2:00 in the morning.
He could have been sleeping.

05:27.554 --> 05:29.166
Copa's here.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.495
When I got to here,

05:33.495 --> 05:36.701
the punk had already fired the second shot
and was turning to go.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.854
I shout "police", shot three rounds,

05:39.854 --> 05:41.321
but he was gone.

05:41.321 --> 05:42.925
So the shooter was alone.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.717
As far as I could see.

05:45.033 --> 05:46.736
And no getaway car.

05:47.070 --> 05:49.921
- I didn't see one.
- So he was on foot.

05:49.921 --> 05:52.880
Yeah. Came out of nowhere.
Silent.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.471
When I saw him,
he was at the window, turning.

05:55.471 --> 05:57.476
So any other witnesses?

05:57.476 --> 05:59.880
- We're still canvassing.
- Good luck.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.633
And the woman you were protecting?

06:01.633 --> 06:04.251
Corinne Williams.
Witnessed a drive-by.

06:04.251 --> 06:05.928
The eighty-sixers, a Flushing gang,

06:05.928 --> 06:08.818
took a shot at the Southsiders,
rival gang in this neighborhood.

06:08.818 --> 06:12.457
Eight-year-old kid took the bullet.
Trial's in two weeks.

06:13.569 --> 06:15.978
And Corinne Williams?

06:15.978 --> 06:18.246
The house with the "for sale" sign.

06:18.246 --> 06:19.809
I didn't see no evil.

06:19.809 --> 06:22.305
Didn't hear no evil,
and didn't do no evil.

06:22.305 --> 06:24.006
This isn't a joke.

06:24.006 --> 06:27.064
A cop is dead.
He had a wife and a son.

06:27.064 --> 06:28.267
A joke?

06:28.267 --> 06:31.515
I'm the only one who came forward
the night that boy was popped.

06:31.515 --> 06:35.012
Shoot, cops can't even protect themselves,
how are they gonna protect me?

06:35.012 --> 06:37.136
Okay. Um...

06:37.136 --> 06:40.459
One of the detectives
took a bathroom break.

06:40.459 --> 06:41.759
Did he use yours?

06:41.759 --> 06:44.331
I always let them use my bathroom.

06:44.331 --> 06:48.159
I offer water.
No one asked last night.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.736
Eric Kim, Bruce Noh,

06:52.736 --> 06:54.942
Johnny Sang, Jasper Lee.

06:54.942 --> 06:58.573
All members of the eighty-sixers,
named after the street they grew up on.

06:58.573 --> 06:59.632
Korean gang?

06:59.632 --> 07:02.115
Started out dealing crack,
graduated to heroin.

07:02.115 --> 07:05.726
Then they expand, fighting for territory
with the Jamaican Southsiders.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.570
Quinn's murder, a message
to Corinne Williams?

07:08.570 --> 07:11.318
They'd have gone after her next,
if Copa hadn't shown up.

07:11.318 --> 07:14.758
So this guy here, Sang,
He's the ring leader.

07:14.758 --> 07:15.995
Who's the enforcer?

07:15.995 --> 07:18.640
They all have felony records.
Sang's out on bail.

07:18.640 --> 07:21.374
We put an APB out on him
and all these mutts.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.190
Two hundred detectives
flooding the zone...

07:24.190 --> 07:25.715
We'll find him.

07:26.388 --> 07:28.926
Interesting bullet. The slugs are
from a balloon head casing,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.667
which means they hold more powder
than a modern bullet.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.371
They still manufacture those?

07:33.371 --> 07:36.236
Not for decades,
but they'd fit in a standard .45.

07:36.236 --> 07:40.263
First shot entered his left temple,
exited over his right ear.

07:40.263 --> 07:41.907
So he died instantly?

07:41.907 --> 07:43.969
Before the bullet stopped moving.

07:43.969 --> 07:47.377
Second one through his right eye,
lodged in his brain.

07:47.836 --> 07:48.657
Close range.

07:48.657 --> 07:51.017
You can't tell about the first shot.
It went through the glass.

07:51.017 --> 07:53.635
Second shot, one to three feet.

07:54.454 --> 07:56.745
From a different angle.

07:57.858 --> 08:02.491
So... the shooter took the time
to change positions.

08:02.491 --> 08:06.000
The first shot was the kill,
the second shot to the eye...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.992
That was a message.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.376
Thanks, Carla.

08:17.691 --> 08:19.178
Uh...

08:21.391 --> 08:24.606
Any strange calls at home?

08:24.606 --> 08:30.154
Any, uh... late night drive-bys?

08:32.985 --> 08:35.886
Had Kevin gotten any threats?

08:36.275 --> 08:39.075
If he did, he wouldn't share it with me.

08:41.424 --> 08:43.293
You know how that...

08:43.293 --> 08:45.146
Yes, I do.

08:49.615 --> 08:52.811
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay, Theresa.

08:52.811 --> 08:54.536
No, it's not.

08:57.776 --> 09:00.381
When Joe died...

09:03.386 --> 09:06.981
I remember telling you
how sorry I was.

09:07.606 --> 09:10.382
If there was anything I could do...

09:12.660 --> 09:16.943
When inside I was thinking
"Thank god it wasn't Kevin."

09:21.056 --> 09:24.102
That's the reason
I haven't kept in touch.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.188
I can never figure out what to say.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.365
Why didn't I use the witness's bathroom?

09:37.365 --> 09:38.960
She hates cops.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.981
Yeah. I got that from her.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.588
I used the chicken joint one block up.

09:45.054 --> 09:48.242
You questioning why I wasn't in the car
with Kevin when this went down?

09:48.242 --> 09:54.361
No, I'm wondering if the killer waited
until he saw you take off.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.628
Could be.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.929
The eighty sixers deal
out of Kissena Park just up the hill.

10:00.592 --> 10:02.447
You think it was one of them?

10:02.447 --> 10:06.326
They're headed by Sang.
A real psycho.

10:06.326 --> 10:09.994
Matches what I saw.
Dark hair, small build.

10:09.994 --> 10:12.312
But if he's the leader,

10:12.312 --> 10:15.460
why wouldn't he send someone else
to do the shootings?

10:15.460 --> 10:17.727
Sang does everything himself.

10:17.727 --> 10:20.070
Has a problem delegating.

10:29.975 --> 10:33.270
Eat your cocoa puffs.
You're gonna be late for camp. Okay?

10:35.596 --> 10:37.267
All right. Good boy.

10:45.151 --> 10:46.420
Positions!

10:47.564 --> 10:49.045
I'll finish that.

10:49.045 --> 10:51.785
Get some water for his hair.
It's sticking up in the back.

11:00.748 --> 11:01.620
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

11:01.620 --> 11:04.093
- Hands in the air! Don't move!
- I got them up!

11:05.179 --> 11:08.223
Don't hurt my kid!

11:37.884 --> 11:39.024
Alex...

11:39.024 --> 11:40.427
Good job.

11:51.004 --> 11:53.373
Take your time, detective.

12:01.422 --> 12:03.022
Number three.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.019
Him.

12:09.009 --> 12:12.349
He shot my partner.
I saw him run.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.893
Good work, Copa.

12:13.893 --> 12:15.973
I need to speak with my client.

12:23.927 --> 12:26.516
Patrick, can I talk to you a second?

12:26.724 --> 12:28.505
Just a couple of questions.

12:28.807 --> 12:29.819
We got the guy.

12:29.819 --> 12:31.946
Yeah, it's just some loose ends.

12:31.946 --> 12:33.793
You know, about your bathroom break.

12:33.793 --> 12:35.445
Again?

12:35.445 --> 12:37.526
Every time I see you, you ask me
where I took a leak.

12:37.526 --> 12:38.414
Yeah, I know.

12:38.414 --> 12:42.990
It's just that you said you took the break
at a chicken joint on hillside...

12:43.848 --> 12:47.573
Yeah, that place closed
Wednesday night. You know...

12:47.573 --> 12:49.775
Health department.

12:50.266 --> 12:52.053
You checking up on me?

12:52.053 --> 12:54.479
I don't know.
Look...

12:54.990 --> 12:58.499
We both know guys get off.

12:58.499 --> 13:02.246
You know, lawyer finds an inconsistency
in the case and...

13:02.246 --> 13:04.384
It falls apart.

13:11.812 --> 13:13.516
Okay.

13:14.359 --> 13:17.215
I wasn't at the chicken place.

13:17.451 --> 13:24.259
I was in a car up the block with Rita.

13:24.259 --> 13:26.736
Uh, Rita?
That's a girlfriend?

13:26.736 --> 13:30.606
She's a buff.
Likes cops.

13:30.918 --> 13:34.036
She texted me, asked where I was.

13:34.036 --> 13:35.874
I gave her my location.

13:35.874 --> 13:39.844
Okay, so you were with her
when Quinn got shot.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.405
I was walking back from her car
when I heard the shots.

13:48.405 --> 13:50.503
A little ways away.

13:55.925 --> 13:58.940
Tell me what my tie clip looks like.

13:58.940 --> 14:02.031
What? / You're a cop, right?
You pay attention to details.

14:02.031 --> 14:03.972
Describe it.

14:05.048 --> 14:08.981
It's a lot brighter in this room,
than it was at 2:00 A.M. on that block.

14:08.981 --> 14:11.963
I wasn't looking at you
like you were a suspect.

14:13.136 --> 14:15.104
Describe it now.

14:17.372 --> 14:19.495
Yeah. Right there.
You have problems.

14:19.495 --> 14:22.131
Seeing straight on.
You gotta turn to the side, right?

14:22.131 --> 14:25.328
You have to look with your peripheral.

14:25.328 --> 14:27.092
I saw you do it when you ID'd Sang,

14:27.092 --> 14:28.791
and you... you did it again just now.

14:28.791 --> 14:29.939
Where the hell do you get off...

14:29.939 --> 14:34.108
A blind spot, right?
In your central vision.

14:34.108 --> 14:36.986
That could be early signs macular
degeneration, I don't know if...

14:36.986 --> 14:39.719
My partner was killed,
and you're trying to discredit me?

14:39.719 --> 14:41.271
I'm not gonna put
an innocent kid in prison.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.332
You think Sang,

14:42.332 --> 14:44.998
the head of one of the most violent gangs
in the city is an innocent kid?

14:44.998 --> 14:47.319
Yeah, well, maybe we should wait
to put him into prison

14:47.319 --> 14:50.140
when we actually catch him
for doing something.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.841
Now, we both know you did not see

14:54.057 --> 14:56.100
who shot Quinn.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.919
Screw you.

15:03.620 --> 15:06.525
Since when is a cop
not a reliable witness?

15:06.525 --> 15:07.956
When he can't see clearly.

15:07.956 --> 15:09.370
I'm not addressing you, detective.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.945
Maybe you should.
I was gonna suggest...

15:10.945 --> 15:12.823
Chief, if the ID's no good,

15:12.823 --> 15:15.421
we have no evidence linking
Sang to the scene.

15:15.421 --> 15:16.919
The D.A. won't touch this.

15:16.919 --> 15:18.881
Did you verify his alibi?

15:18.881 --> 15:22.485
He said he was at his girlfriend's getting
his son ready for his first day of camp.

15:22.485 --> 15:23.772
Girlfriend confirmed.

15:23.772 --> 15:25.772
Not exactly airtight.

15:25.772 --> 15:29.102
Okay, well then we should charge him
based on a lie, I think.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.180
Watch yourself, detective.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.020
An NYPD eyewitness ID'd him in a lineup.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.746
Sang has motive and a hearsay alibi.

15:37.746 --> 15:38.860
You wanna cut him lose?

15:38.860 --> 15:41.187
You better have a lot
more than just a hunch.

15:41.187 --> 15:43.660
Detective Goren is doing his job...

15:43.660 --> 15:46.097
His job is to find Quinn's shooter.

15:46.097 --> 15:48.351
And we intend to do that.

15:54.372 --> 15:56.286
Funeral's tomorrow.

15:56.774 --> 15:59.747
Good luck explaining this
to Theresa Quinn.

16:08.849 --> 16:11.681
Look, I'm not gonna go inside, all right?
I don't have a lot of friends in there, all right?

16:11.681 --> 16:14.367
Be uh... Well.

16:24.081 --> 16:26.316
You have the nerve to show up here?

16:27.340 --> 16:29.603
Your partner and my partner
were close.

16:29.603 --> 16:32.313
All I wanna do is find the killer.

16:32.945 --> 16:36.371
I'm on desk, pending a medical.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.801
Maybe looking at forced retirement.

16:39.443 --> 16:41.650
Well done, detective.

16:56.573 --> 17:00.581
St. Paddy's day parade. '95.

17:01.581 --> 17:04.092
Right after we got married.

17:04.722 --> 17:06.296
Remember they were singing, um...

17:06.296 --> 17:08.190
Wild rover.

17:09.317 --> 17:11.824
It's the only song Joe knew.

17:14.211 --> 17:15.770
Yeah.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.640
Ah, Kevin, uh...
Kevin was playing the pipes.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.953
He loved the parade,

17:23.953 --> 17:26.734
'cause he was usually playing at funerals.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.380
Oh, Theresa.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.769
You'll get through this.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.188
I did.

17:42.700 --> 17:46.222
Is it true your partner
made them release that bastard?

17:53.990 --> 17:56.448
- Yo, heads up.
- Okay.

18:00.189 --> 18:03.293
Wow. This looks tricky, huh?

18:03.619 --> 18:05.061
Kinda.

18:05.061 --> 18:08.723
You move your feet like this
to go forward. / Right.

18:08.723 --> 18:11.676
And you shift your weight to turn.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.843
Nice.

18:14.089 --> 18:16.565
- No sound?
- Mm-mm.

18:18.151 --> 18:23.041
So... did you hear about that detective
that let my dad's killer get away?

18:24.824 --> 18:26.328
Nah, we'll get his killer.

18:26.328 --> 18:31.395
The chief of D's, he told my mom
that that detective was a whack job.

18:33.949 --> 18:35.322
See ya.

18:41.614 --> 18:43.689
So how did it go in there?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.554
Not good.

18:48.696 --> 18:51.036
I wasn't very popular either.

18:53.971 --> 18:56.738
I knew most of those guys in there.

18:58.318 --> 19:01.747
They were at the hospital,
at Joe's wake.

19:04.449 --> 19:07.809
And then one by one
I stopped hearing from them.

19:09.558 --> 19:15.550
I haven't seen anyone
in that room in... eight years.

19:15.550 --> 19:21.311
Well... after a loss, you know,

19:21.311 --> 19:25.015
people, they, you know,

19:25.015 --> 19:26.995
well, they screw up.

19:31.510 --> 19:36.166
After Joe died, it got complicated.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.404
Without him...

19:40.404 --> 19:43.615
there wasn't a place for me anymore.

19:59.516 --> 20:01.187
I got your back, dude.

20:25.986 --> 20:27.340
Low-level drug dealer.

20:27.340 --> 20:32.163
He had crack vials, 300 in cash,
same M.O. as Quinn.

20:32.411 --> 20:34.648
Right down to the shot to the eye.

20:37.561 --> 20:39.194
Any I.D.?

20:40.586 --> 20:42.256
I know him.

20:43.358 --> 20:45.303
That's Alfred Minaya.

20:45.920 --> 20:50.154
He testified against the shooter
in my husband's murder case.

20:55.970 --> 20:59.777
My husband was working undercover.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.315
A big buy.

21:02.315 --> 21:08.583
Alone with two dealers.
He was... wired up.

21:08.583 --> 21:11.491
The techs lost transmission.

21:12.524 --> 21:14.757
Quinn rushed the building.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.740
By the time he found Joe,
the dealers were gone,

21:17.740 --> 21:21.090
and Joe had been shot in the stomach.

21:21.090 --> 21:24.031
He never fully regained consciousness.

21:24.031 --> 21:26.490
He died a day later.

21:27.057 --> 21:29.977
- And Minaya?
- One of the two sellers.

21:29.977 --> 21:31.901
When they caught up with him,
he cooperated.

21:31.901 --> 21:35.693
He ID'd Ray Delgado as Joe's killer.

21:35.693 --> 21:39.287
Minaya testified he saw Ray fire.

21:39.287 --> 21:42.870
Quinn testified he saw
Ray fleeing the scene.

21:42.870 --> 21:46.084
And suddenly they are shot
within four days of each other.

21:48.151 --> 21:50.533
You know, I'm gonna have
to take you off this.

21:50.533 --> 21:53.083
This isn't about Joe's murder.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.220
That's been solved.

21:55.220 --> 21:57.381
This is about Kevin Quinn's murder.

21:57.381 --> 21:58.930
It's also about appearances.

21:58.930 --> 22:00.431
We don't wanna catch this guy

22:00.431 --> 22:02.778
and have his lawyers say
it's a trumped-up bag of charges,

22:02.778 --> 22:05.018
because the lead detective is
out for revenge.

22:05.018 --> 22:07.003
I kept my maiden name.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.481
My husband's name was Joe Dutton.

22:09.481 --> 22:11.176
No one's ever gonna make the connection.

22:11.176 --> 22:12.720
Eames, it has to come out.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.427
Someone new is gonna waste time
getting up to speed,

22:16.427 --> 22:18.051
and my partner...

22:18.051 --> 22:21.810
he doesn't adapt well to change.

22:24.014 --> 22:26.458
Okay, I'll try to keep you on
for as long as I can.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.712
But as it becomes clear that what you're
working on involves your husband's case...

22:29.712 --> 22:31.496
I understand.

22:33.678 --> 22:39.183
Tell him he can stop pacing
and come join us.

22:41.547 --> 22:43.979
So I just heard from ballistics,

22:43.979 --> 22:46.905
Minaya and Quinn were killed
with the same gun.

22:46.905 --> 22:48.323
What do we have on Minaya?

22:48.323 --> 22:51.577
Deals heroin and crack in the park,

22:51.577 --> 22:56.237
multiple arrests, six eyewitnesses,
six different descriptions,

22:56.237 --> 22:59.606
but they all agree the shooter
came out of nowhere.

22:59.606 --> 23:02.720
There were some skateboarders
in the park nearby.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.004
So our killer uses antique ammo

23:05.004 --> 23:08.874
and seems to be avenging
a nine year-old crime.

23:08.874 --> 23:12.087
Delgado, the shooter in
your husband's case, where's he?

23:12.087 --> 23:14.305
Upstate.
Dannemora, life sentence.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.526
This could be revenge.

23:16.526 --> 23:17.567
Yeah, but why now?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.597
What I heard from the PBA,

23:19.597 --> 23:23.241
two months ago Delgado
lost his last appeal.

23:32.705 --> 23:35.843
You're the last person
I expected to see on a visitation.

23:35.843 --> 23:37.200
Ray, you know why we're here?

23:37.200 --> 23:39.156
Yeah, you're pissed
I'm reopening my case.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.643
Your last appeal was denied.

23:40.643 --> 23:43.274
Project Innocence might take it on.

23:46.348 --> 23:47.780
You're innocent?

23:47.780 --> 23:50.510
Hey, look.
I might have done a lot of things,

23:50.510 --> 23:53.052
but I didn't kill your husband.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.873
Two witnesses put you there.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.646
You're saying that they lied?

24:03.181 --> 24:06.159
- Must make you angry.
- Yeah. It does.

24:06.159 --> 24:08.398
Angry enough to have them killed.

24:08.398 --> 24:11.361
We're going through your visitor logs
and your cell mate records.

24:11.361 --> 24:13.102
Go ahead.

24:14.014 --> 24:17.364
You know how guards treat
a cop killer here in prison?

24:17.364 --> 24:19.878
They're on me 24/7.

24:19.878 --> 24:23.635
I got no time to arrange a hit,
or afford one.

24:24.172 --> 24:28.013
So you're innocent now,
you were innocent then.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.415
So why did Quinn and Minaya ID you?

24:31.415 --> 24:33.424
Minaya and I were in the same posse.

24:33.424 --> 24:36.655
Whoever was with him that
night might have outranked me.

24:39.379 --> 24:41.964
The night Joe Dutton was killed?

24:41.964 --> 24:43.840
- I was at work.
- Dealing.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.567
Yeah. Tompkins square.

24:45.567 --> 24:49.846
Too bad. If you had a real job,
you'd have a real alibi.

24:52.977 --> 24:57.196
Look, he didn't even seem to
get a charge out of talking to you.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.095
You're the widow.

24:58.095 --> 25:00.525
I didn't even see a hint of him
asking for forgiveness.

25:00.525 --> 25:02.986
So you think he's innocent
because he didn't say "sorry"?

25:02.986 --> 25:06.457
No, I... the pressure
that we got to nail Sang,

25:06.457 --> 25:07.722
in Joe's case they probably
got the same...

25:07.722 --> 25:10.456
Bobby, Delgado killed my husband.

25:10.456 --> 25:13.293
He is angry,
because his appeal was denied,

25:13.293 --> 25:18.151
so he put a hit out on the two people
who put him away.

25:23.724 --> 25:28.239
Project innocence is not gonna
take on a cop killer

25:28.239 --> 25:32.428
- unless there are red flag.
- I'm sure he lied about that too.

25:39.110 --> 25:42.840
I spoke to project innocence.
They're not interested in this case.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.539
They said Delgado's mother's been...

25:56.216 --> 25:58.779
You're going through Joe's case file?

25:58.779 --> 26:02.089
Eames... / What do you think
you'll find there, Bobby?

26:02.089 --> 26:05.755
Well, there was a lit cigarette
at your husband's crime scene, a menthol.

26:05.755 --> 26:07.532
I know that.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.038
Minaya testified it belonged to Delgado.

26:10.038 --> 26:12.066
Well, Delgado said
that he didn't smoke.

26:12.066 --> 26:14.366
Well, CSU just couldn't get
enough DNA off of it

26:14.366 --> 26:15.821
to prove that Delgado was lying.

26:15.821 --> 26:17.133
Yes, nine years ago.

26:17.133 --> 26:20.012
You know that today they
only need a trace of DNA.

26:20.012 --> 26:26.070
Kevin Quinn ID'd him as running
from the scene, gun in hand.

26:26.070 --> 26:27.787
Witnesses make mistakes.

26:27.787 --> 26:32.166
And if it's Delgado's DNA,
it will confirm his guilt.

26:32.166 --> 26:34.236
But you don't think it will.

26:35.731 --> 26:37.641
Is that it?

26:42.755 --> 26:46.648
This isn't another one of your puzzles.

26:56.953 --> 27:01.741
You know that we have to do this.
We've got to do it.

27:01.741 --> 27:05.480
If it's not Delgado's DNA,

27:05.480 --> 27:08.438
it means he wasn't there,

27:08.438 --> 27:11.747
and someone else killed Joe.

27:12.429 --> 27:15.063
And got away with it.

27:21.974 --> 27:25.313
Case 297-06.
I got nothing back there.

27:25.313 --> 27:27.876
- What do you mean?
- It's missing.

27:28.756 --> 27:30.463
How hard did you look?

27:30.463 --> 27:32.296
Well, it's not where it's supposed to be.

27:32.296 --> 27:33.949
What do you want me to do?
Check the whole warehouse?

27:33.949 --> 27:35.292
We'll wait.

27:35.292 --> 27:37.995
Lady, you wanna spend
all weekend here? Be my guest.

27:37.995 --> 27:39.311
What do you mean "lady"?

27:39.311 --> 27:41.767
You mean "detective Eames," don't you?

27:42.090 --> 27:46.781
Look, that evidence that you can't find
has to do with a cop killer.

27:47.114 --> 27:49.598
You want me to come back there
and find the box?

27:49.598 --> 27:52.428
I'll find it, I'll tear this place
apart, okay? Hmm?

27:52.428 --> 27:54.443
'cause I'm the whack job, understand?

27:54.443 --> 27:57.117
Lighten up, buddy, okay?
I'll check it again.

27:57.117 --> 27:58.452
Okay.

28:01.650 --> 28:03.199
Yeah.

28:03.199 --> 28:04.603
Hang on.

28:05.322 --> 28:07.522
They found Quinn's murder weapon.

28:09.850 --> 28:12.824
- Well, can you chase that? 'cause...
- Yeah.

28:14.825 --> 28:18.115
A .45 caliber M11-A1.

28:18.516 --> 28:22.668
A1, that was standard issue
for officers in Vietnam, wasn't it?

28:22.668 --> 28:24.933
We pulled it two blocks from
where Minaya was shot.

28:24.933 --> 28:26.400
No prints.

28:26.636 --> 28:27.911
Thanks.

28:29.113 --> 28:31.852
Delgado's prison records.

28:31.852 --> 28:34.305
All his cell mates are still incarcerated.

28:34.305 --> 28:36.162
And the visitors' log?

28:36.162 --> 28:41.735
Looks like aside from his lawyers,
his only visitors have been immediate family.

28:41.735 --> 28:44.120
Any chance one of them is a vet?

28:44.757 --> 28:49.079
Yeah, my wife calls Project Innocence
once a month.

28:49.079 --> 28:51.869
When I tell her and Victor,
they'll flip out.

28:51.869 --> 28:53.486
Who's Victor?

28:53.486 --> 28:55.908
My grandson.
Ray's boy.

28:57.281 --> 29:03.826
So your wife and Victor will be excited,
but not you.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.502
I hope Ray didn't do it.

29:08.752 --> 29:11.093
You were a marine, huh?
Is that Vietnam?

29:11.093 --> 29:15.511
Third battalion, first regiment.
'66 to '70.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.955
I was in korea, in the army, CID.

29:17.955 --> 29:19.615
- Army?
- Yeah.

29:19.615 --> 29:21.847
Marines make a man out of you.

29:22.502 --> 29:24.452
That's what I told Victor.

29:24.452 --> 29:27.024
He just signed up.
Starts basic next week.

29:27.024 --> 29:28.329
Oh, yeah?

29:29.399 --> 29:31.173
There's Victor now.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.902
It must have fallen behind something.

29:51.345 --> 29:54.653
Hey, congratulations.
Where you're going to basic?

29:54.653 --> 29:56.979
Same place I did.
Parris island.

29:56.979 --> 29:58.214
Oh, yeah?

29:58.405 --> 30:01.021
You know, a lot of things have changed
since then, you know that, right?

30:01.021 --> 30:03.051
What kind of gun did
you carry back then?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.595
Uh, a Hush Puppy?

30:04.595 --> 30:06.406
What, are you kidding? M11.

30:06.406 --> 30:08.148
Hey, listen, pops, I gotta take off, okay?

30:08.148 --> 30:10.869
Where are you going?
Don't be rude.

30:10.869 --> 30:12.425
You still got it?

30:12.645 --> 30:15.161
- Matter of fact, I do.
- I got a lot of errands.

30:15.161 --> 30:18.067
- Can I see it?
- Sure, I got nothing to hide.

30:18.273 --> 30:20.281
- Victor will get it for you.
- Oh, yeah?

30:20.281 --> 30:21.960
Go ahead.

30:23.436 --> 30:25.237
I don't know where it is.

30:25.237 --> 30:27.193
Where it always is.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.053
Go get it.

30:32.419 --> 30:35.620
Victor... Que te pasa?

31:40.274 --> 31:42.664
Last year, Nana remodeled the kitchen.

31:42.664 --> 31:44.519
The workers were walking in and out.

31:44.519 --> 31:47.024
Victor, that gun wasn't stolen.

31:47.024 --> 31:50.526
It was used to kill two witnesses
that helped convict your dad.

31:50.526 --> 31:53.731
My dad is innocent.
NYPD framed him.

31:53.731 --> 31:55.417
I know that...

31:56.719 --> 32:00.156
That your dad and your grandma
believe that.

32:00.156 --> 32:02.399
I might even believe it.

32:06.002 --> 32:07.976
How about your mom?

32:10.024 --> 32:12.180
She left when I was ten.

32:13.815 --> 32:16.078
My grandparents raised me.

32:20.041 --> 32:24.529
Every month you drive four hours
to see your dad in Dannemora.

32:24.529 --> 32:26.255
Five.

32:27.453 --> 32:30.738
The video is set up in interrogation.

32:35.275 --> 32:36.522
What are you doing to my grandpa?

32:36.522 --> 32:38.856
Uh, it's okay.
He's cooperating.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.130
Cooperating? What do you mean?

32:41.130 --> 32:43.995
Relax, Victor. We'll let you see him
after his confession, okay?

32:43.995 --> 32:45.162
- Confession?
- Yeah.

32:45.162 --> 32:46.825
No, I got to talk to him right now.

32:46.825 --> 32:48.168
Victor?

32:51.073 --> 32:52.953
After his confession, all right?

32:52.953 --> 32:54.559
He didn't do it.

32:54.559 --> 32:57.026
Yeah, I know.
Your whole family is innocent.

33:00.927 --> 33:04.230
His gun killed Minaya
and detective Quinn.

33:04.230 --> 33:06.178
His bullets.

33:06.574 --> 33:09.390
He had motive. Okay?
You said so yourself.

33:09.390 --> 33:12.199
He didn't kill them.

33:13.447 --> 33:16.975
He needed to settle a score.
I get that.

33:16.975 --> 33:18.237
That's not what happened.

33:18.237 --> 33:20.619
He'll be eligible for parole in 25.

33:20.619 --> 33:23.138
But he's 70. He's got diabetes.
He has to be monitored.

33:23.138 --> 33:25.350
So maybe you can ask that
he get a place close to home.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.621
You won't have to drive so far.

33:27.621 --> 33:30.119
You're used to that kind of thing, right?

33:31.259 --> 33:32.620
You've been staring at your dad

33:32.620 --> 33:36.090
through a plexiglass window
for your whole life, so...

33:36.090 --> 33:38.256
We haven't got all day. Come on.

33:41.563 --> 33:43.651
I did it!

33:45.191 --> 33:46.920
Okay?

33:47.538 --> 33:50.210
I did it, not my grandpa.

33:51.741 --> 33:53.614
I killed them.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.067
I shot the two of them.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.210
They lied on the stand.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.604
Nine years. That's half my life.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.110
So I took theirs.

34:04.695 --> 34:06.753
And before I shot those liars,

34:06.753 --> 34:11.674
I told both of them,
"this is for my dad."

34:19.318 --> 34:21.541
I'll give him a few minutes.

34:27.292 --> 34:30.429
There is no such thing as getting even.

34:34.826 --> 34:37.204
I'm sorry about your husband.

34:39.065 --> 34:40.630
I never knew.

34:41.416 --> 34:43.583
So the cigarette from the crime scene?

34:43.583 --> 34:46.603
There was enough DNA for an I.D.

34:46.603 --> 34:48.400
Ray Delgado?

34:48.719 --> 34:51.717
No. He's not a match.

35:01.905 --> 35:04.089
Minaya lied.

35:04.089 --> 35:07.640
Yeah. He said that Delgado had
the lit cigarette in his mouth

35:07.640 --> 35:09.874
when Joe was shot.

35:10.329 --> 35:12.964
Minaya was the shooter all along.

35:12.964 --> 35:15.389
It wasn't his DNA.

35:18.745 --> 35:22.718
Well, if it wasn't Minaya,
it wasn't Joe...

35:24.231 --> 35:29.081
Someone else was in that room
when Joe got shot, Alex.

35:30.548 --> 35:32.914
What do we know
about Minaya's gang?

35:32.914 --> 35:35.300
Four lieutenants, one died of AIDS,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.770
one's in prison for armed robbery.

35:37.770 --> 35:40.649
One retired to Florida, and the fourth...

35:40.649 --> 35:44.907
George Lombardi, was paroled
two months ago for manslaughter.

35:44.907 --> 35:48.397
None of their DNA matched
the cigarette either.

35:48.397 --> 35:51.737
Start with Lombardi.
He has the most to lose.

35:53.336 --> 35:56.202
You kiddin'?
Nine-year-old murder?

35:56.778 --> 35:58.821
I'm lucky I remember
what day of the week it is.

35:58.821 --> 36:02.360
Yeah, I bet you remember exactly
how many days you spent inside.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.539
I did my bid.

36:03.539 --> 36:06.952
Well, it'd be a shame if something
happened to put you back in.

36:06.952 --> 36:09.278
Did we see him run a red light?

36:10.110 --> 36:12.571
Come on, man.
Don't play games.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.507
Lombardi... I'm not gonna
have to search you am I?

36:15.507 --> 36:19.069
Find some organic weed?

36:20.205 --> 36:23.373
Look, that cop that was shot,
everybody knows it was Delgado.

36:23.373 --> 36:26.981
No, see, we think Minaya fingered
Delgado to protect you.

36:26.981 --> 36:28.470
Me?

36:28.877 --> 36:31.690
Minaya would have given me up
in a second to save his own ass.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.789
We weren't buddies.
We sold coke together.

36:35.353 --> 36:38.135
Who would he go out on a limb for?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.730
Look, all I know, that summer

36:41.730 --> 36:45.117
Minaya had some small kid
following him like a puppy,

36:45.117 --> 36:47.485
waving a Glock around.

36:47.971 --> 36:50.920
The little guys always
carry the biggest guns.

36:51.665 --> 36:55.345
- Look, can I get back to work now?
- Yes, sure.

36:58.020 --> 36:59.401
Lombardi turned fast.

36:59.401 --> 37:02.155
If he had a name to give us,
he would have.

37:03.435 --> 37:07.089
Sounds like Minaya wasn't protecting
someone in his posse.

37:07.089 --> 37:09.956
He was protecting someone
closer to him?

37:11.604 --> 37:17.747
Mrs. Minaya, we wanted you to know
we arrested your son's killer yesterday.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.784
May he rest in peace.

37:19.784 --> 37:22.723
We think that Alfred may have been killed

37:22.723 --> 37:28.895
because of his testimony...
back when that cop was killed.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.115
Anyone else in your family run
with his crowd?

37:38.115 --> 37:39.931
They might be in danger too.

37:39.931 --> 37:41.647
Nothing like that.

37:46.107 --> 37:49.765
Is this Alfred and his brother?

37:49.765 --> 37:51.839
No, his cousin Manny.

37:52.268 --> 37:54.656
Manny in the same line
of work as Alfred?

37:54.656 --> 37:57.192
Not every Puerto Rican
is a drug dealer, detective.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.425
Manny's a doctor.

37:58.425 --> 38:02.236
Emergency room surgeon,
the first in our family.

38:03.664 --> 38:06.743
- Did he go to school in the city?
- No, San Juan.

38:07.061 --> 38:11.687
Oh. But this photo is taken
at the Grand Concourse.

38:11.687 --> 38:14.228
Yeah, he spent one summer here.

38:14.228 --> 38:16.133
That was enough.

38:17.489 --> 38:19.053
He's still in Puerto Rico?

38:19.053 --> 38:20.381
Now?

38:21.210 --> 38:23.724
At Starch memorial in Queens.

38:33.116 --> 38:35.186
Doctor Manny Beltran?

38:35.186 --> 38:36.575
Yes?

38:37.594 --> 38:40.188
Sorry I can't shake your hand.
What can I do for you?

38:40.188 --> 38:41.458
We're with Major Case.

38:41.458 --> 38:44.069
We're investigating
the murder of a police officer.

38:44.069 --> 38:45.770
Detective Quinn?

38:46.389 --> 38:48.717
We did everything we could, but...

38:49.905 --> 38:51.953
Stuff's hard to get off
your hands, isn't it?

38:51.953 --> 38:55.012
Gets under your skin
and your clothes, right?

38:59.869 --> 39:02.000
That's not Betadine.

39:02.572 --> 39:05.924
That's at least a pack a day of
nicotine stains like that.

39:05.924 --> 39:08.583
You're a doctor and you smoke, huh?

39:08.583 --> 39:10.464
Menthols?

39:10.464 --> 39:12.984
When it's your time, it's your time, right?

39:15.767 --> 39:21.729
Well, this may be your time, Dr. Beltran.

39:22.385 --> 39:25.880
See, we're... we're not here
about detective Quinn.

39:25.880 --> 39:30.733
We're here about another detective,
Joe Dutton.

39:31.568 --> 39:34.045
You see, nine years ago,

39:34.045 --> 39:37.591
a cigarette butt was found
at the scene of his murder.

39:37.591 --> 39:39.907
The killer smoked it.

39:39.907 --> 39:44.261
That's what a witness told us.
But you remember that.

39:48.993 --> 39:52.686
They can do amazing things
with forensics, huh?

39:52.882 --> 39:55.515
A whole decade gone by.

39:56.466 --> 39:59.513
Just a trace of DNA.

40:00.783 --> 40:05.086
But you're a doctor.
You know about that.

40:09.382 --> 40:11.940
This cigarette...

40:13.770 --> 40:16.625
You found a trace, didn't you?

40:16.865 --> 40:20.354
What did you think?
That this wouldn't catch up with you?

40:20.758 --> 40:25.845
I swear to god, it was an accident.
A terrible accident.

40:29.014 --> 40:31.533
So many years ago.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.993
I still have nightmares.

40:33.993 --> 40:35.466
You killed a police officer.

40:35.466 --> 40:38.566
I thought he was going for a gun.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.884
I didn't realize until
after I'd shot him that...

40:42.660 --> 40:45.324
He was just going for his shield.

40:53.241 --> 40:56.148
But you never came forward.

40:57.300 --> 41:00.550
Alfred put me on a plane
to San Juan the next day.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.810
We never talked about it.

41:05.538 --> 41:08.553
I save people.

41:08.553 --> 41:11.857
I... I've saved hundreds of lives.

41:13.042 --> 41:16.100
It doesn't make up
for the one you took away.

41:19.378 --> 41:24.986
Manny Beltran, you are under arrest
for the murder of Joseph Dutton.

41:27.466 --> 41:31.690
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I never came forward.

41:32.213 --> 41:36.882
That officer...
He's why I became a doctor.

41:36.882 --> 41:39.462
To make amends somehow.

41:40.782 --> 41:43.005
I took his life away.

41:43.531 --> 41:46.199
I have no idea who he was.

41:47.847 --> 41:50.023
He was a good cop.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
