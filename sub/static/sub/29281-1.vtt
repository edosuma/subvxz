00:17.618 --> 00:22.488
Far, far away in an earlier time

00:22.490 --> 00:27.559
and another world, there
was a king of kings.

00:28.029 --> 00:32.331
He was
the ruler of all kingdoms.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.800
He was the Rabbit King.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.339
Dawn had broken, waking the
Rabbit King from his slumber,

00:40.341 --> 00:43.475
but 'twas not a normal morning.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.345
Something
was stirring in the air,

00:46.347 --> 00:50.416
and this made
the Rabbit King very uneasy,

00:51.052 --> 00:53.719
as something wicked was coming.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.657
The Rabbit King was
ready for what may come,

00:58.659 --> 01:03.195
for whatever may come,
it would meet his wrath.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.113
Oh, oh god.

01:23.084 --> 01:27.219
Oh, fuck, oh.

01:32.159 --> 01:36.228
Sir, sir, let's sit you down.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.730
I didn't see him, man.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.233
I think you're injured.

01:41.235 --> 01:44.203
I didn't see him, man.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.806
I was at, but I didn't see him.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.708
Let's just sit you down.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.376
The ambulance is on the way.

01:51.378 --> 01:52.711
They're gonna
wanna check you out.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.246
And do you think they're dead?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.582
I don't know, I need
to go check on them,

01:56.584 --> 02:00.185
but first I need you
to sit down for me.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.720
I didn't see him.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.790
Just drink your beer, sit down.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.259
Oh shit, I'm bleeding,

02:08.262 --> 02:10.395
oh I'm bleeding.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.600
Am I gonna go to jail.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.869
I can't go to jail.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.248
I can't go to jail.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.692
Please!

02:55.643 --> 02:57.726
I can't go to jail.

02:57.727 --> 02:59.810
It's okay, it's okay,
sweetheart, look at me.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.313
Everything is gonna be okay.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.648
We're gonna get you outta here.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.216
I just really
need you to hold still

03:04.218 --> 03:05.884
until the paramedics can get
here, okay?

03:08.354 --> 03:10.821
Do you understand what
I'm saying, sweetheart?

03:11.659 --> 03:14.326
Good, just keep your eyes on me.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.196
We're gonna take very
good care of you, okay?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.935
Look at me, stay awake,

03:22.937 --> 03:25.604
everything is gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.606
Just look at me.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.741
We've got one right here.

03:32.279 --> 03:36.548
Stay with me, look at me,
look at me in the eyes.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.221
Everything's gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.356
En route to 496 Broadway.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.925
We have another
response unit ready?

03:46.927 --> 03:49.928
Uh what's...

03:54.368 --> 03:59.371
Dr. Brantley,
2744, Dr. Brantley.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.583
Said you wanted
to tell me about that.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.851
So, I had a question

04:12.853 --> 04:15.454
because you know Dr. Phillip?

04:15.456 --> 04:16.738
Oh yeah.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.023
She kind of
comes off with that way,

04:18.024 --> 04:19.925
saying was over
there, and I was like worried,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.027
like what's going on,
gynecological?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.597
- No, don't.
- No it's not.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.532
Oh, okay.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.474
No, it is not gynecologic.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.376
And it's not because you
at the parents

04:37.378 --> 04:38.377
and you could do...

04:38.379 --> 04:40.279
Oh, my gosh, what?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.881
Oh like this, okay,
okay, yeah, good.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.449
Thank you
Vera so much for trouble...

04:44.451 --> 04:45.817
Okay, okay.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.290
Miss Ritz?

04:56.597 --> 04:58.964
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

04:58.966 --> 04:59.965
Have you been waiting long?

04:59.967 --> 05:01.667
No.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.903
First of all my
condolences for your loss.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.972
We weren't close.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.442
However you are the
sister of the deceased.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.910
Yeah.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.012
Do you have
a relationship with Nina?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.415
Not really, met her
when she was a baby

05:16.417 --> 05:18.550
in a Christmas years ago.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.921
Here mother
and I were never close.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.824
The reason
why I asked you to come in

05:25.826 --> 05:30.529
is that Nina has no place
now that her family's gone.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.067
She needs a place to stay.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.771
Somewhere where there's family.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.476
You're her aunt.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.078
So, live with me?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.746
Of course.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.816
I don't, I don't know
anything about kids.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.719
Okay.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.621
The reason why
I asked you to come in,

05:56.623 --> 05:58.724
I asked...
I don't even know her.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.693
Just, just, we want
to avoid foster care.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.862
I'm sure she
doesn't even know who I am.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.131
And have her with family.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.841
I've talked with the attorneys
who have been working

06:15.843 --> 06:18.710
on the estate

06:18.712 --> 06:23.014
and there will be funds
to help with raising her.

06:24.985 --> 06:29.388
We have advocates that
can help you with a plan.

06:32.826 --> 06:33.892
Just move.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.065
Paging Dr. Statement,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
Dr. Statement please.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.068
Follow my finger.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.077
Dr. Hubisec, 2945,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.146
Dr. Hubisec, 2945.

06:54.148 --> 06:57.616
Hey Syd, good to see you here.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.152
Morning Anthony.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.826
Well kiddo, it seems you'll
be well to go in a day or two.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.429
You took quite
a bump on your head

07:10.431 --> 07:12.564
which gave you a concussion.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.199
Are your headaches gone?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.767
Yes.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.103
Any dizziness?

07:18.105 --> 07:19.671
No.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.808
That's a good sign.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.643
She's a lucky kid.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.947
She had a hematoma
due to the head injury.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.783
We had to drain a
collection of excess fluid

07:31.785 --> 07:33.852
from around the wound.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.654
I wanted to keep
her just a few more days

07:35.656 --> 07:37.722
just to be safe.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.692
I'll be back in a few days.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.993
Okay.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.764
Too slow.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.470
Goodbye, Sydney.

07:51.472 --> 07:54.573
Dr. Metta, 2945,

07:54.575 --> 07:55.907
Dr. Metta, 2945.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.217
So you okay, kiddo?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.653
You've had a tough break.

08:09.857 --> 08:13.058
There's someone here to see you.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.126
This is Erma, your aunt.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.865
Hi.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.901
Hey.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.573
Some people from my office
went by your old house

08:28.575 --> 08:30.075
and got some of your things.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.243
My Rabbits?

08:31.245 --> 08:33.712
All of them all in a box.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.047
My mask.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.517
It's all waiting for you.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.956
Home sweet home.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.831
Maybe Aunt Erma would like
to show you to your room.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.900
It's upstairs.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.711
It's the guest room where
people crash

10:12.713 --> 10:14.679
when I have a party.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.748
Guess it's yours now.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.226
It's a new bed.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.362
Wasn't that nice of Erma?

10:31.865 --> 10:36.067
Yeah, nicer than mine.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.942
Those are your things.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.345
Could I talk to you a minute?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.591
What?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.425
You're trying to raise a child.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.094
What do you want from me?

11:03.096 --> 11:05.113
Effort.

11:05.114 --> 11:07.194
Kids room, looks like a
cell, looks like a jail cell.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.136
It's my house.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.338
Things had taken a dark turn

11:15.541 --> 11:17.741
for the Rabbit King and
his princess daughter

11:17.744 --> 11:20.412
had become
separated during their travels

11:20.414 --> 11:22.681
in the dark woods.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.451
The princess
sat frightened and alone

11:27.354 --> 11:31.790
as she waited for her
father, the Rabbit King.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.093
However she remembered
something the Rabbit King

11:35.095 --> 11:36.227
had told her.

11:37.064 --> 11:40.331
Never fear
as I am always in your heart

11:41.435 --> 11:44.836
for love is stronger than evil.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.705
I will find you

11:46.707 --> 11:49.474
wherever you may be.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.976
Always hold me in your heart

11:51.978 --> 11:55.714
as I do with you
and I will always

11:55.716 --> 11:57.782
find my way to you.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.898
You're going
to need to be strong.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.435
How long
do you think that'll take?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.036
She's odd.

12:54.407 --> 12:58.943
She's family and she's
just as nervous as you are.

13:00.914 --> 13:05.383
Listen, there's an old saying

13:06.253 --> 13:10.255
those who are hardest to
love need it the most.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.026
We spent a lot of time together

13:15.028 --> 13:18.229
so it's safe to
say that we're friends

13:19.533 --> 13:22.534
and you can call me anytime

13:22.536 --> 13:25.336
if you need anything. All right?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.373
You need anything.

13:30.076 --> 13:33.144
I'll see you soon.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.016
Hey.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.284
Hey.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.256
What's that?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.325
Takin' care of shit.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.462
You got any weed?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.465
Yeah, I got weed.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.069
Wanna come in?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.437
In a bit.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.505
Okay.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.942
You know Ash is coming by later.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.011
Ooo, I'll pull
out the good chips.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.155
Oh my God.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.232
Oh no.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.300
Oh my.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.149
Oh my God.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.518
Laura.

18:16.663 --> 18:20.431
Oh Gracie, thank God.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.501
Get, get some, get some help.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.460
Whoever invented
the doughnut is rich.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.165
Did you know the doughnut

19:27.167 --> 19:30.568
was invented in the
in the 19th century?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.707
Dutch settlers invented it
when they came to America.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.943
They actually called it by
a different name, though.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.645
Olykoek.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.313
It means oil cake.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.382
What?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.589
Son of a bitch.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.359
Didn't see that coming.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.496
Do you know
why they taste so good?

20:00.233 --> 20:03.701
No, why do
doughnuts taste so good?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.371
It's the hole.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.806
What?

20:08.808 --> 20:10.741
It's the hole.

20:11.477 --> 20:15.279
A 16-year-old kid
invented the hole in 1847.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.919
I take your knight.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.721
Son of a gun.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.756
Anyway.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.360
Anyways, his
name was Hanson Gregory.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.963
He was a seaman on a lime
trading ship.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.965
Evidently, he didn't
like the way the cook

20:33.967 --> 20:35.800
was making these cakes.

20:35.802 --> 20:36.901
When you would bite into one,

20:36.903 --> 20:40.738
the inside was
too greasy and doughy.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.474
So, cook it longer.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.909
He did that.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.811
Although he cooked it longer,

20:46.813 --> 20:50.414
the outside would
be burnt or overcooked

20:50.416 --> 20:52.984
and so Gregory had this idea,
punch a hole

20:52.986 --> 20:55.386
through the center
of the cake making sure

20:55.388 --> 20:59.824
that the outside was as
evenly cooked as the inside.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.892
And voila, doughnuts.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.264
How do you know this shit?

21:06.266 --> 21:09.600
I know
all sorts of trivial shit.

21:11.704 --> 21:15.306
You actually arrest people.

21:19.012 --> 21:22.346
Paul, you there?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.883
- Yeah, I'm here.
- What's up, Eleanor?

21:27.803 --> 21:29.720
There's a problem
up at the state hospital.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.789
They need you
up there right away.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.493
Is it serious?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.362
I think so.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.665
Chief Marchesi is
headed up there now.

21:41.668 --> 21:44.302
I'm on my way, over and out.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.338
Over and out.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.341
One for the road?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.858
Jesus Christ.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.753
Getting everything
you need there, Wyatt?

25:22.755 --> 25:24.522
Yeah, boss.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.290
Just let me get one more
picture of these teeth on her

25:26.292 --> 25:28.192
and I think I'm done.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.729
Can I take Paul off your hands?

25:31.731 --> 25:34.198
Please, before he throws up.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.977
How's it going, Paul?

25:46.979 --> 25:52.049
Considering the
circumstances, okay I guess.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.554
You need to memorize this file.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.055
Escapee's name
is Milton Treadwell,

25:58.057 --> 26:00.157
a retarded 30-year-old.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.959
Obviously dangerous.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.796
What the hell happened here?

26:05.798 --> 26:08.799
Well, we know the
incident started here.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.235
They were prepping Milton
for his weekly shower

26:11.237 --> 26:13.671
and well, we
only have one survivor

26:13.673 --> 26:17.074
and he can't
really tell us what happened.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.877
He's pretty fucked up.

26:21.681 --> 26:26.216
How many orderlies does
it take to shower this guy?

26:26.218 --> 26:29.687
Evidently he didn't like
taking them.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.891
He either found some opportunity

26:33.893 --> 26:36.226
or something pissed him off.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.297
Some of these asylum
employees have been known

26:40.299 --> 26:42.366
not to be real angels.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.636
That guy over there,
total asshole.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.707
I arrested him for smacking
around his girlfriends,

26:49.709 --> 26:52.943
urinating in public,
drug possession.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.113
He probably had it coming
when it came to Milton.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.984
Anyway, after the ruckus,
it's out that door.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.153
Takes care of
business over there.

27:03.155 --> 27:06.724
Ends up two
floors down at the cafeteria.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.960
The boys found
two more bodies down there.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.397
Then he's out the kitchen
door and into the night.

27:22.041 --> 27:26.110
Let's talk about
this over a slice. I'm hungry.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.353
There you go, Paul.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.257
Skeedaddle.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.065
Fuck you.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.410
Hey.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.146
What?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.814
What's that?

28:06.085 --> 28:07.084
What?

28:07.086 --> 28:09.286
What's that right there?

28:13.459 --> 28:15.092
It's a corpse.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.227
Yeah, and do they walk?

28:18.464 --> 28:19.730
What?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.131
Do they walk?

28:22.334 --> 28:23.967
They're dead.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.370
Right, so put down
your goddamn coffee cup

28:26.372 --> 28:28.439
and put him in a bag.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.178
Jesus.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.265
Shh, listen.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.336
Do you hear that?

29:08.380 --> 29:10.114
Ah.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.885
It's pretty.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.060
June, June, June.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.062
Hi, Ash.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.999
How you been, baby?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.969
Got something for me?

30:32.531 --> 30:35.132
Who's been naughty or nice?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.002
Santa Claus has come to town.

31:49.275 --> 31:52.342
So, Erma.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.114
How's it going?

32:06.058 --> 32:08.125
My condolences.

32:11.030 --> 32:15.098
We weren't close.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.981
Say, I had a job come up.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.384
I need a person with a car.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.523
I could use a job.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.993
I have a kid now.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.329
What?

32:46.699 --> 32:49.299
My sister's kid.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.101
She lives with me now.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.170
She's...

32:59.745 --> 33:02.012
Upstairs.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.584
Sleeping.

33:19.732 --> 33:22.265
Uh.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.012
Ah.

33:37.516 --> 33:41.251
Oh my goodness.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.226
Dear.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.697
Do you have any music?

38:18.063 --> 38:20.864
Jesus Christ, seven feet tall,

38:21.833 --> 38:25.902
350 pounds, hysterical strength.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.506
It says here he's been
institutionalized

38:29.508 --> 38:32.075
since he was 10 years old.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.010
I'm the one who brought him in.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.745
No kidding?

38:35.747 --> 38:37.380
No kidding.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.449
That was a bad night.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.651
I had friends in the
department at the hospital

38:41.653 --> 38:44.854
who turned in their
resignation after that night.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.024
No one had ever
seen anything so awful.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.060
What did he do?

38:50.062 --> 38:52.329
It was the mother.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.506
That's her.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.874
Iva Treadwell.

39:05.811 --> 39:09.446
That woman was goofier
than a wooden watch.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.847
She was mad.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.550
What happened?

39:13.552 --> 39:15.752
It's a pretty sad story.

39:17.622 --> 39:21.091
When Milton
was born he almost died.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.927
He was breach.

39:23.929 --> 39:28.631
The doctors got him out but
they had to use the forceps

39:29.501 --> 39:31.801
so there was brain damage.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.737
Treadwells loved
that boy just the same.

39:33.739 --> 39:37.907
But with Milton's damage,
things got difficult

39:37.909 --> 39:39.976
as he got older.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.878
There were
reports of pets going missing

39:41.880 --> 39:44.414
in a certain part of town.

39:44.416 --> 39:47.050
Milton lived
in that part of town.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.651
He was 10.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.588
Dogs?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.123
And cats.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.927
He was luring
pets and killing them.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.629
How'd he get caught?

39:59.631 --> 40:02.899
Mr. Treadwell found the
carcasses in the basement.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.034
That was the final straw.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.104
He walked out and was
never heard from again.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.173
He didn't report it?

40:12.411 --> 40:14.811
I think he just wanted out.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.180
Iva had some issues herself.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.848
She was psychotic.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.552
Things really spiraled
down when she had to fend

40:22.554 --> 40:24.521
for the boy and herself.

40:29.828 --> 40:33.563
Then she started
neglecting her medication.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.002
Something made
Iva click that day.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.938
I honestly
think it was heartbreak.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.873
The resentment of
having the love of her life

40:43.875 --> 40:45.775
walk out on
her and leave her to care for

40:45.777 --> 40:48.845
a retarded
animal killer by herself

40:49.648 --> 40:52.482
just got to be too much.

40:52.484 --> 40:55.552
One day
she was making breakfast.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.788
Bacon to be exact.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.254
That woman took that
hot pan full of grease

41:31.256 --> 41:34.591
and dumped it
all over her boy's head.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.868
She turn herself in?

41:44.870 --> 41:46.002
No.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.136
No?

41:47.138 --> 41:49.873
It was another six
months before we learned

41:49.875 --> 41:51.708
what happened to Milton.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.009
Iva panicked.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.980
She knew if anybody saw that
boy's wounds she'd be done.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.249
So she tended the wounds herself

41:59.251 --> 42:02.218
and hid him away from
society in her basement.

42:02.220 --> 42:06.155
For six months that boy
was down in the basement?

42:06.157 --> 42:08.691
Milton wasn't really
out in the public eye much

42:08.693 --> 42:11.194
so no one
noticed he was missing.

42:11.196 --> 42:15.865
He went to a special
school in the next county

42:15.867 --> 42:20.236
so the school in town wouldn't
have noticed him absent.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.804
Man oh man.

42:21.806 --> 42:27.810
Six months went by, that boy
never saw the light of day.

42:27.812 --> 42:30.313
Iva kept him chained to
a pipe in the basement

42:30.315 --> 42:33.016
so he wouldn't leave the house.

42:33.018 --> 42:35.051
How'd she get caught?

42:35.053 --> 42:37.120
Couple of transients
came into the station

42:37.122 --> 42:39.188
late one night and turned
themselves in.

42:40.574 --> 42:41.957
They'd broken
into the Treadwell basement

42:41.960 --> 42:43.760
looking for valuables to pawn.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.937
That's when they found Milton.

43:11.022 --> 43:13.122
They told us there was a
deformed boy

43:13.124 --> 43:16.192
chained in a
basement on Lincoln Street.

43:23.802 --> 43:25.702
I almost feel sorry for Milton.

43:28.039 --> 43:30.373
Look, you
meet up with that psycho

43:30.375 --> 43:33.076
you put a bullet in his head.

43:33.078 --> 43:35.311
He doesn't know any different.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.380
Milton stopped progressing
which means he still thinks

43:37.382 --> 43:39.148
he's 10 years old.

43:39.985 --> 43:43.920
Before this situation tonight,
there was another incident

43:43.922 --> 43:46.923
several years
before you came on board.

43:46.925 --> 43:51.160
We had to take that SOB
down with an elephant dart.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.697
He literally ripped
another inmate's arm off

43:54.699 --> 43:56.766
over a pudding pack.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.069
A pudding pack?

44:00.705 --> 44:04.073
After that he was in solitary.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.809
How'd he get out of solitary?

44:07.712 --> 44:09.379
Somebody fucked up.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.185
As far as I'm concerned,
we're looking for an oversized

44:16.187 --> 44:20.123
break neck
man child with retard strength.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.891
What if we talk to his mother?

44:21.893 --> 44:23.292
Maybe she knows where he went.

44:23.294 --> 44:25.645
Maybe he went back home.

44:25.646 --> 44:27.997
The Treadwell house
burned down years ago.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.700
There's an
apartment complex there now.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.802
She told us everything we know.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.038
Well?

44:35.039 --> 44:37.273
Iva killed herself two
weeks after we arrested her.

44:37.275 --> 44:39.409
Hung herself in her cell.

44:42.113 --> 44:44.814
I need to go to the men's room.

47:46.431 --> 47:48.331
What's your name?

47:48.333 --> 47:49.866
Nina.

47:51.302 --> 47:53.236
What are you doing here?

47:53.238 --> 47:54.871
I live here.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.207
You, you live here?

47:58.209 --> 48:00.209
I got here yesterday.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.345
My parents died.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.641
Your parents died?

48:32.543 --> 48:34.677
We were in a car wreck.

48:36.915 --> 48:39.248
And, and why are you here?

48:40.385 --> 48:42.451
Erma's my aunt.

48:45.223 --> 48:47.290
Oh.

48:54.966 --> 48:56.933
You hurt much?

48:56.935 --> 48:58.401
A little.

48:58.403 --> 49:00.970
The doctor said
I had a bad concussion,

49:00.972 --> 49:02.471
but I'm lucky.

49:02.473 --> 49:05.007
He said I'd be a little off.

49:06.511 --> 49:11.514
Well, if it's worth anything,
you seem pretty okay to me.

49:13.318 --> 49:15.384
Nina's a pretty name.

49:16.721 --> 49:18.721
Do you live here?

49:18.723 --> 49:20.156
No.

49:20.158 --> 49:22.491
Well, kind of.

49:22.493 --> 49:25.328
Uh, depends, I guess.

49:26.464 --> 49:29.198
It's a place to stay sometimes.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.535
Yeah, Erma,
Erma and I are good friends.

49:36.441 --> 49:40.509
Was Erma your
mom's sister or your dad's?

49:40.511 --> 49:43.379
I think my mom.

49:43.381 --> 49:45.081
I never knew Erma.

49:45.083 --> 49:48.284
My parents didn't really
talk about her much.

49:48.286 --> 49:49.719
Hmm.

50:02.266 --> 50:04.333
The Rabbit King.

50:05.203 --> 50:08.637
I used to read
this to my little girl.

50:08.639 --> 50:10.706
You have a daughter?

50:16.381 --> 50:18.114
No, I, I used to.

50:20.752 --> 50:23.219
She died several years ago.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.391
How did she die?

50:28.760 --> 50:33.462
Um a car hit her.

50:38.269 --> 50:42.338
She was across the street
at her friend's house.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.741
And I called her
to come home for dinner.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.745
Then I heard the horn.

50:54.252 --> 50:58.120
I came outside
and there's this old man

50:58.122 --> 51:00.456
kneeling in front of his car

51:02.393 --> 51:04.460
over my baby.

51:08.633 --> 51:12.635
And all I could see were
her feet sticking out.

51:17.508 --> 51:19.575
God, oh God.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.112
That man felt so awful.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.649
He was just, he just
couldn't stop in time.

51:34.358 --> 51:37.426
Gosh, she's just, yeah.

51:40.665 --> 51:44.200
She used to
cross that street every day.

51:51.642 --> 51:53.375
I'm sorry.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.278
Yeah, yeah.

51:58.549 --> 52:00.549
I'm, oh, I am so sorry.

52:03.554 --> 52:06.889
I still, oh,
still a little messed up

52:06.891 --> 52:09.191
from last night I guess.

52:10.161 --> 52:11.560
Mmm.

52:18.769 --> 52:20.469
You like music?

52:21.339 --> 52:22.471
Yeah.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.506
Yeah?

52:23.508 --> 52:24.773
What do you like?

52:24.775 --> 52:28.210
Sisters of Mercy, the Cure.

52:28.212 --> 52:29.545
Really?

52:30.548 --> 52:32.348
My dad listened to them.

52:32.350 --> 52:33.916
He liked the weird stuff.

52:33.918 --> 52:36.252
No, no, I like 'em too.

52:39.624 --> 52:42.691
I think we're
gonna be good friends.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.466
Ya have one of these?

52:50.468 --> 52:51.667
No.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.506
It's yours.

52:59.277 --> 53:00.276
Really?

53:00.278 --> 53:01.443
Yeah.

53:01.445 --> 53:03.512
I can get another one.

53:25.269 --> 53:27.203
Fuck.

53:42.253 --> 53:45.821
Erma, you didn't tell me
Nina was living with you?

53:45.823 --> 53:46.822
What?

53:46.824 --> 53:48.357
Nina.

53:48.359 --> 53:50.459
You didn't tell me you
had a kid staying here.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.928
So, it just happened.

53:52.930 --> 53:56.565
My sister's dead, now
she's living with me.

53:56.567 --> 53:57.800
Yeah.

53:57.802 --> 54:00.002
That's what she just said.

54:00.905 --> 54:02.605
I didn't even
know you had a sister.

54:02.607 --> 54:04.673
We weren't close.

54:05.876 --> 54:07.326
Shit.

54:07.327 --> 54:08.777
God, I wouldn't have had
Ash come over last night

54:08.779 --> 54:09.979
if I knew she was here.

54:09.981 --> 54:12.781
What's the big deal,
she was sleeping.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.516
God, Erma.

54:20.891 --> 54:23.959
I need coffee, oh.

54:25.396 --> 54:28.264
What you need is some food.

54:28.266 --> 54:29.698
She needs to eat.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.835
Well, I'll take her
and get a burger later.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.941
Look, I got to make a couple
runs for Ash

54:38.943 --> 54:41.877
and then I'm at the club but
I'll be back

54:41.879 --> 54:44.647
in a couple days with groceries.

54:44.649 --> 54:46.548
I hope you're using condoms.

54:50.521 --> 54:52.054
Ash gave me a job.

54:53.758 --> 54:57.459
Just be careful with him, Erma.

54:57.461 --> 54:58.994
It's one job.

54:59.897 --> 55:01.630
I got to do something
until the money comes in

55:01.632 --> 55:04.300
to take care of the kid.

55:04.302 --> 55:05.701
All right.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.638
Bye sweetie.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.839
Bye.

55:13.844 --> 55:14.910
Hey.

55:16.947 --> 55:19.648
Just be careful with him, okay?

55:19.650 --> 55:20.983
He's not right.

57:11.028 --> 57:12.895
Great um, hmm.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.433
90.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.036
It's mother...

57:25.910 --> 57:28.177
Fuck you, fish.

57:47.965 --> 57:49.698
Hello.

58:11.188 --> 58:13.255
Hello.

59:37.641 --> 59:38.874
Huh.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.876
Woo!

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:26.441
Good morning.

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:27.809
How can I help ya?

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.177
Mornin'.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:31.813
I'm from distribution.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:34.082
I'm here to see your buyer.

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:38.787
I have a special Mary Kaye 59
Stratocaster

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:40.856
he may be interested in.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:46.094
I haven't seen
you in here before.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:49.097
I'm from
the North County branch.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.358
Please step over here, please.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.398
Okay, stop.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.201
Turn around, face me, please.

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:27.936
Hands up.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:57.299
You'll get it back when
your appointment's over.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.039
Sir, your appointment's here.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:08.043
Oh, Mr. Ash.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:10.111
Hello, Mr. Ash.

01:04:16.887 --> 01:04:18.119
Hello.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.893
Please come down.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:29.164
Follow him.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:21.309
Mr. Ash, we finally meet.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:32.988
My apologies for the late
face-to-face introduction.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:36.091
We keep things cloak and dagger

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:39.160
until we work with
colleagues for a few months.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.563
You understand.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:43.298
Absolutely.

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:48.470
May I offer you a drink,
Blood and Sand, perhaps,

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:50.271
a Dirty Martini?

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.308
No thank you.

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:01.782
Now, we can
go straight to business.

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.652
Uh, you mentioned on the
phone that have something

01:07:04.654 --> 01:07:05.754
to show to me.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.038
Look at her.

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:25.306
Such an angel.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.560
This is from Ash.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:20.694
He is one of our distributors.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:24.399
He brought us a picture
of a perfect little angel.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:27.469
What do you think?

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:37.578
She will do.

01:08:40.417 --> 01:08:42.584
She will do.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.404
It's okay.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:39.474
That is all now.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.621
You can take this back.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.223
I have no need for it.

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:03.531
When do you think you
can make the delivery?

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.402
It'll take a few days.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:11.739
Hmm, well then, we'll
talk in a few days.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.410
Bobby.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.513
Yeah, boss.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:21.549
Mr. Ash is making his way up.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.953
Oh, I'll be waiting
with bated breath, sir.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:26.421
Very good.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:31.893
It was nice to put a face
behind the name, Mr. Ash.

01:10:33.296 --> 01:10:35.430
You can see yourself out.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.572
Mr. Ash.

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:53.815
I take pride in the
ability to read people.

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:57.685
Throughout our meeting, you
had the look of reluctance

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:58.820
on your face.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.856
Now you must understand

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.792
that I'm running
a very lucrative business.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:08.963
We have consequential clients

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:13.835
who pay
a considerable amount of money

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:16.971
to do unspeakable things.

01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:23.044
And we fulfill them, Mr. Ash.

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:27.915
Now, some of those things
are hard to look past

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:29.517
in the beginning,

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.387
but, what do they say,

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:37.325
money talks, bullshit walks.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:46.668
I like to think the people
who work for me as my partners

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.736
not just distributors.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:52.006
Now, you can understand
how important it is

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:54.809
that I can trust these partners.

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.379
I need people I can rely on.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:03.017
If I cannot
rely on you, Mr. Ash,

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:04.752
we have a problem.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:08.990
I hope you can understand that.

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:14.962
Good day, Mr. Ash.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.524
We need to
lay some cards on the table.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.631
I'm not
so hot on this situation.

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:27.802
I don't know why you're
sitting here in front of me.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:31.873
I, I, I'd figure that I, aw,

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.843
I would be the
last person that my sister

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:39.914
would want her daughter
to come and live with.

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:44.185
She and I never got along.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:52.093
I don't even really know
why we went to the hospital

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:55.062
after I got the call from CPS.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.831
Maybe curiosity.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.102
All the way to the hospital
I was wondering why

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.906
my sister thought of
me to be your guardian.

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.943
I think it was an olive branch,

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.848
strange
olive branch from the dead.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:19.554
But what the hell, maybe
it'll be something special,

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:23.157
a nice change
in my shitty little life.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:27.829
Knowing my sister's ego,
maybe that was her reason.

01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:31.799
But that would be giving
her too much credit.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.868
You mother was a bitch.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:40.508
You wanna know
why you never met me?

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:45.012
I used to date your dad.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.783
All the shitty
luck I had with men

01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:51.085
and then I met your father.

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:58.025
He was so handsome and very kind

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:03.965
and I fell in love with him

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:08.769
on our third date.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:15.643
And one day I introduced
him to my sister.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:18.179
Wanted to show him off,
show her I had something

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:20.515
she'd never have.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.850
And he took one look
at her and I was done.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.153
She was always the prettier
one, the smarter one,

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:27.855
the sane one.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:34.962
She was always steps ahead and
I was always in her shadow.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.802
She was the golden bitch.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.746
He was gonna take me to Japan.

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:57.818
I always wanted to go there.

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:15.036
Son of a bitch.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:37.825
Erma.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.731
Erma.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:49.937
Oh, hi, Lowell.

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:53.140
I didn't see you standing there.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:56.210
I haven't seen
the rent check yet, Erma!

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.013
This is Lowell.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:03.250
His dick
got blown off in the war.

01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:10.124
You're two months back.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.060
You're two months back rent,
Erma.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.864
I'll have the money in a
couple of days.

01:17:16.866 --> 01:17:18.666
You're always saying that.

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:21.268
- I just got a job.
- I'll have the money.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:26.340
I'm serious, Erma, I
better have that

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:31.112
rent check or I'm gonna
serve you a letter.

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:34.949
I'll be by
the house in two days.

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:37.318
This is bullshit.

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:49.330
Two days, Erma, two days.

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:00.107
He doesn't have a penis?

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.189
Yeah.

01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:17.958
Yeah, that's me.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.429
Hang on.

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:24.699
Can you put away the groceries?

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.940
Okay.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:36.977
Yeah.

01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:40.715
Yeah, I know where it is.

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:44.051
Okay bye.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:52.126
I got to see a person
about my new job tomorrow

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:54.061
so you're on your own.

01:18:59.035 --> 01:19:01.335
You can have bologna and bread

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.304
but don't go crazy 'cause
it's got to last a couple days

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:06.173
until June
gets here with the food.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.413
I'm going to bed.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.431
Uh.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:33.400
They're clean.

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:35.035
Just a couple of kids parkin'.

01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:39.106
10-4.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:56.356
Okay, I'm gonna let you
guys off with a warning.

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:58.259
No more parking.

01:19:58.261 --> 01:19:59.393
Yes, sir, thank you.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.796
A lotta bad
things happen out here.

01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:03.831
Thank you, sir.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:06.467
Also, the other day
we had a mental patient

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.970
escape from the asylum on
the other side of the hill.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.172
We haven't found him yet.

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:13.440
He's extremely dangerous.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:17.178
So if I were you, take
your girlfriend, go home,

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.913
lock the door.

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:20.281
Goin' home right now, sir.

01:20:20.283 --> 01:20:22.149
Thank you, Officer.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.385
All right, stay safe,
have a good night.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.458
Come in, Paul.

01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.130
Go ahead, Eleanor.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.601
Just got a phone call

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:15.536
from Harvey Stettler's mother.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.938
She hasn't seen
him for a day and a half.

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.574
She said he went to work on
Monday but never came home.

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.677
Maybe he went to the
casino or something.

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:27.314
Can you check it out, Paul.

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.550
Yeah, on my way.

01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:28.208
Harv, you here?

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.073
Eleanor, this is Paul.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:37.478
I need you to call in, I need
you to call the coroner's

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.514
down to Harv's place right now.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:41.615
And call the chief.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.350
He's gonna
wanna be down here, too.

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:47.721
Is everything okay, Paul?

01:23:51.627 --> 01:23:53.794
It's, it's Harv.

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:55.396
I found him.

01:23:56.499 --> 01:23:58.632
There's, there's a lot of blood.

01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.816
Days have
passed and the princess

01:25:55.818 --> 01:26:00.154
would practice her training
to keep her mind elsewhere.

01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:03.457
But she missed her
father, the Rabbit King.

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:06.160
She was losing patience.

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:09.496
She was
starting to get that itch.

01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:53.500
What are you doing here?

01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:57.437
What the hell you doing here?

01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:59.439
Walking.

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.677
You're
walking in the wrong place.

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:05.412
Where are you from?

01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:11.518
You always
trespass on people's property?

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.587
And hand that over.

01:28:19.295 --> 01:28:21.361
Hand that over.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:29.803
Nice.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.605
Headphones, too.

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:45.485
I don't want this.

01:28:46.422 --> 01:28:48.488
I like Floyd.

01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:51.926
Backpack too.

01:29:13.949 --> 01:29:16.016
Bologna sucks.

01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:20.620
Gimme the top, too.

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:24.791
Consider this a toll.

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:28.795
Now, take your little sword.

01:29:28.797 --> 01:29:30.997
Take your little sandwich.

01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:34.568
Take your terrible little tape

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:36.570
and get the fuck outta here.

01:29:36.572 --> 01:29:37.871
Don't come back.

01:29:39.742 --> 01:29:41.541
You say anything I'll find you

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.610
and I'll slit your throat.

01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:13.700
Where are they from?

01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:15.101
Utah.

01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:16.636
Hitchhikers.

01:31:34.223 --> 01:31:36.156
They're very pretty.

01:32:52.301 --> 01:32:54.000
Hey, Ben.

01:32:56.605 --> 01:33:00.106
I think we
should give 'em the cocktail.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:04.044
I can't handle all the
thumping and screaming.

01:33:06.949 --> 01:33:11.217
I visited the Belgian for
the first time yesterday.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.888
I got a taste of what
happens to the product

01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:16.957
after the delivery.

01:33:18.226 --> 01:33:20.293
It gave me the willies.

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:30.704
We have an issue.

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.706
Yeah, what's that?

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:35.875
The boys went out the other
night and painted the town.

01:33:35.877 --> 01:33:38.845
Gavin had
a little too much to drink.

01:33:38.847 --> 01:33:42.248
He mentioned
your name in a conversation.

01:33:43.819 --> 01:33:45.885
No shit.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:50.023
Hey, Gavin.

01:33:50.759 --> 01:33:53.093
Come here a minute, will ya?

01:34:00.902 --> 01:34:02.335
How you doing, son?

01:34:02.337 --> 01:34:03.937
Good.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.175
We got a little problem
we got to sort out.

01:34:09.845 --> 01:34:11.911
Sure, Ash.

01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:15.382
I hear tell you
and the boys went out

01:34:15.384 --> 01:34:17.884
and painted
the town the other night.

01:34:17.886 --> 01:34:21.221
Yeah, that was a crazy night.

01:34:21.223 --> 01:34:23.073
Yeah.

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:24.924
It's always good
to let off a little steam

01:34:24.926 --> 01:34:26.259
now and then.

01:34:26.862 --> 01:34:29.796
You have a lot to drink, did ya?

01:34:31.233 --> 01:34:32.966
We had a few.

01:34:33.368 --> 01:34:37.437
Yeah, well, the others
being good employees

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:43.276
they had some
concerns and they brought it

01:34:43.278 --> 01:34:45.812
to Will and I's attention.

01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:52.819
You happened to mention
my name in a conversation?

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:02.295
Did you mention my name in a
conversation?

01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:03.763
I might have.

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:06.266
You might have.

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:09.135
You better think, son.

01:35:10.072 --> 01:35:13.239
Look, Ash, we met some girls
that were looking for work

01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:14.774
and I knew
you were looking so I...

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:16.142
Did I ask for your help?

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:17.444
Ash.

01:35:18.447 --> 01:35:20.714
Who were these girls?

01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:23.283
I've seen 'em
in the tavern before.

01:35:23.285 --> 01:35:24.484
Local gals.

01:35:24.486 --> 01:35:26.319
Yeah.

01:35:26.321 --> 01:35:27.987
Yeah.

01:35:31.827 --> 01:35:35.895
The number one rule is
to never mention my name.

01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:40.100
We never mention names.

01:35:42.104 --> 01:35:45.105
I know, Ash, I fucked up.

01:35:45.107 --> 01:35:47.173
It won't happen again.

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.176
Yeah, I know.

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:21.541
Time's a-wasting, gentlemen.

01:38:16.191 --> 01:38:17.257
Hey.

01:38:18.159 --> 01:38:20.226
What are you doing here?

01:38:37.312 --> 01:38:39.412
You're not supposed to be here.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:41.614
She's not supposed to be...

01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:46.119
Shh.

01:38:48.056 --> 01:38:49.989
Looks like
we're victims of bad timing,

01:38:49.991 --> 01:38:51.991
wouldn't you agree?

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:57.330
Hey, you wanna play with us?

01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:26.025
What the hell was that?

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:27.460
Is she dead?

01:39:28.630 --> 01:39:30.029
No.

01:39:31.399 --> 01:39:33.032
Not yet.

01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:35.335
What?

01:39:37.138 --> 01:39:39.205
She's a virgin.

01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:44.143
Hey, hey, you said animals only.

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:46.312
This is too perfect.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.481
This'll bring us to the new
level, closer to Belial.

01:39:48.483 --> 01:39:50.216
We can't do this.

01:39:51.119 --> 01:39:53.419
Wh-what about the body?

01:39:53.421 --> 01:39:56.022
I have a shovel
in the trunk of my car.

01:39:56.024 --> 01:39:58.358
We'll dig a hole over there.

01:39:59.594 --> 01:40:02.695
You wanted to be a part
of this little group.

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:06.165
After Whiskers, there's no
turning back.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:10.370
Anyway, we'll just make
everything go away.

01:40:10.372 --> 01:40:13.506
I always
have a shovel in my car.

01:40:47.675 --> 01:40:49.342
Hurry up.

01:40:50.478 --> 01:40:54.080
You're digging
the hole yourself.

01:40:54.082 --> 01:40:55.381
Pussy.

01:40:57.185 --> 01:40:58.651
Fucking bitch.

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:16.469
Just do it.

01:41:35.123 --> 01:41:37.256
This is better than cats.

01:42:03.485 --> 01:42:05.118
The princess was warned

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.220
how dangerous the dark woods

01:42:07.222 --> 01:42:10.523
would be for
a young girl to travel.

01:42:10.525 --> 01:42:14.360
However,
her father, the Rabbit King,

01:42:14.362 --> 01:42:16.562
had found
her in the nick of time

01:42:16.564 --> 01:42:18.898
to slaughter the evil creatures

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:23.503
who were, in essence,
attempting to devour her soul.

01:42:24.873 --> 01:42:29.275
"Behold, my princess,"
declared the Rabbit King.

01:42:29.277 --> 01:42:32.178
"Keep your
heart full and we will always"

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:35.214
"find our way
back to one another."

01:42:35.216 --> 01:42:37.817
"Your Rabbit King has returned."

01:43:24.432 --> 01:43:25.498
Hey.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:32.538
Hey!

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.606
Shit.

01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:36.309
Shit.

01:43:39.514 --> 01:43:40.580
Hey.

01:43:42.483 --> 01:43:45.551
Oh, yeah, you must be Erma, huh?

01:43:46.387 --> 01:43:47.553
Yeah.

01:43:47.922 --> 01:43:49.589
Hey, come on in.

01:43:50.525 --> 01:43:52.592
Uh, have a seat.

01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:02.335
This is your first time, huh?

01:44:05.306 --> 01:44:09.242
Ash was saying you may
be a little, uh, green.

01:44:09.978 --> 01:44:12.245
Yeah, pretty much.

01:44:13.648 --> 01:44:16.949
Well, the job's pretty
much a cake walk, all right.

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:18.884
Few deliveries,
then you'll be back home

01:44:18.886 --> 01:44:21.320
in the trailer
park before you know it.

01:44:21.322 --> 01:44:22.655
You really
don't have to do that much.

01:44:22.657 --> 01:44:25.491
You just have to...

01:44:25.493 --> 01:44:27.560
Shit, goddamn it!

01:44:33.534 --> 01:44:36.969
Anyway, it's pretty much
in and out job, all right.

01:44:36.971 --> 01:44:39.505
You show up with the goods

01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:41.874
and they give you the cash.

01:44:41.876 --> 01:44:43.743
There's about
30 deliveries in that bag.

01:44:43.745 --> 01:44:44.844
Each one's measured and labeled

01:44:44.846 --> 01:44:47.780
for which customer it's for.

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:49.415
What is it?

01:44:49.417 --> 01:44:50.816
That?

01:44:50.818 --> 01:44:53.819
Quaaludes, Ecstasy, and poppers.

01:44:53.821 --> 01:44:55.821
Is this gonna be dangerous?

01:44:55.823 --> 01:44:56.889
No.

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:58.591
Those are club drugs.

01:44:58.593 --> 01:45:00.426
You'll be
selling to college students,

01:45:00.428 --> 01:45:03.396
clubbers, and fucking
rich kids, all right?

01:45:03.398 --> 01:45:07.333
Oh another thing, don't mess
with the supply either, okay?

01:45:07.335 --> 01:45:09.402
Ash does
not fuck around with that shit.

01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:10.603
If the customers
don't get what they want

01:45:10.605 --> 01:45:12.338
he'll find out about it.

01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:14.740
And never,
mention his name, ever.

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:20.713
Want something to drink?

01:45:20.715 --> 01:45:22.148
No.

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.582
All right, you're gonna
go to Everett and Ferndales

01:45:23.584 --> 01:45:25.384
as part of your drops.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:27.420
That's six hours away.

01:45:27.422 --> 01:45:31.691
Yeah, but that's where
the business is, okay?

01:45:31.693 --> 01:45:33.793
They like their drugs.

01:45:33.795 --> 01:45:35.594
I really hope this
isn't gonna be a problem

01:45:35.596 --> 01:45:36.796
'cause you start today.

01:45:36.798 --> 01:45:39.398
I don't have any gas.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.035
That's all right, we
take care of your gas

01:45:43.037 --> 01:45:44.804
and your hotel expenses.

01:45:44.806 --> 01:45:46.339
No shit.

01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:50.643
You take care of Ash,
he takes care of you.

01:45:50.645 --> 01:45:52.611
I'm sure you
notice these beauty marks

01:45:52.613 --> 01:45:54.714
I have all over my face.

01:45:54.716 --> 01:45:59.051
Well, a couple weeks ago,
I was in a car wreck.

01:45:59.053 --> 01:46:02.855
Killed a whole family
except their little girl.

01:46:02.857 --> 01:46:07.059
I was gonna go to prison,
but he got me out of it.

01:46:09.864 --> 01:46:12.131
The girl lived, huh?

01:46:12.133 --> 01:46:14.801
Yeah.

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:17.470
Anyway, you need anything,
I am your cicerone.

01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:29.715
You like shrooms?

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:30.950
I guess.

01:46:30.952 --> 01:46:34.787
Mmm, I got
the Scandinavian species.

01:46:34.789 --> 01:46:36.822
Grown in the best cow shit in
the valley.

01:46:36.824 --> 01:46:38.557
I don't know if you're
up on current events

01:46:38.559 --> 01:46:40.760
but there's a
reason I need a job.

01:46:40.762 --> 01:46:43.313
That's all right.

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:45.865
I'm sure we can figure out
other forms of payment.

01:46:45.867 --> 01:46:47.967
I'm not gonna make things
uncomfortable, okay?

01:46:47.969 --> 01:46:49.702
I'm gonna actually
make them very easy.

01:46:49.704 --> 01:46:51.504
I'm gonna lay you all the
cards out on the table

01:46:51.506 --> 01:46:54.673
and really
all you have to do is draw.

01:46:58.713 --> 01:47:02.815
So I'm gonna go in the back,
shut the door behind me.

01:47:02.817 --> 01:47:04.450
If you decide you wanna
spend a little time

01:47:04.452 --> 01:47:09.455
with a fun guy for a little
bag of fungi,

01:47:09.457 --> 01:47:11.824
all you have to do is knock.

01:47:11.826 --> 01:47:12.858
You think that...

01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.593
Hey, shh.

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:15.828
Let me finish.

01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:18.063
If you decide to
leave, so be it.

01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:19.698
No hard feelings.

01:47:20.635 --> 01:47:23.469
But I'm gonna
go back here, shut the door.

01:47:23.471 --> 01:47:25.171
It's up to you now, all right?

01:48:48.890 --> 01:48:52.024
Come on, it's okay.

01:49:10.311 --> 01:49:11.810
I live here.

01:49:14.949 --> 01:49:17.283
My parents died.

01:49:18.553 --> 01:49:20.619
I live with my aunt.

01:49:27.862 --> 01:49:29.929
Is that your name?

01:49:32.567 --> 01:49:34.633
Harvey.

01:50:22.617 --> 01:50:23.617
Here.

01:50:38.332 --> 01:50:40.399
It's okay.

01:50:47.074 --> 01:50:48.374
Hello?

01:50:48.376 --> 01:50:50.075
It's Erma.

01:50:50.077 --> 01:50:51.710
Hi, Erma.

01:50:53.247 --> 01:50:54.847
I'm not coming
for a couple of days.

01:50:54.849 --> 01:50:57.149
I have some stuff to do.

01:50:57.918 --> 01:50:59.785
Gotta go out of town.

01:51:01.255 --> 01:51:02.821
Okay.

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:04.723
You've got enough
bologna and bread

01:51:04.725 --> 01:51:07.393
so you
should be good for awhile.

01:51:08.295 --> 01:51:10.829
June will be there tomorrow.

01:51:14.335 --> 01:51:16.068
That's fine.

01:51:17.371 --> 01:51:20.372
Don't fuck with anything.

01:51:20.374 --> 01:51:22.708
I got to go.

01:52:11.092 --> 01:52:12.124
Hello?

01:52:12.126 --> 01:52:14.093
Hey, kiddo, it's Sydney.

01:52:14.095 --> 01:52:15.360
Hi, Sydney.

01:52:15.362 --> 01:52:17.029
How are things going?

01:52:17.031 --> 01:52:18.197
Okay.

01:52:18.766 --> 01:52:20.466
Are you getting along with Erma.

01:52:20.468 --> 01:52:22.334
Yeah, she's fine.

01:52:22.336 --> 01:52:24.503
She says crappy things
sometimes,

01:52:24.505 --> 01:52:26.438
but I just ignore her.

01:52:27.508 --> 01:52:29.808
Is she taking care of you?

01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:30.876
Yeah.

01:52:33.214 --> 01:52:35.147
Can I talk to her?

01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:38.283
She's not here. She's working.

01:52:38.285 --> 01:52:40.352
Are you alone?

01:52:44.225 --> 01:52:47.893
Yeah, but it's okay,
she's coming home.

01:52:49.497 --> 01:52:53.298
You're not
supposed to be alone, Nina.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:55.234
How's your head?

01:52:55.236 --> 01:52:57.903
It hurts sometimes, but,

01:53:00.941 --> 01:53:03.008
but it's fine.

01:53:04.812 --> 01:53:06.779
Is it just headaches?

01:53:08.115 --> 01:53:10.182
What was that?

01:53:13.053 --> 01:53:14.820
I knocked a glass over.

01:53:14.822 --> 01:53:16.188
I got to go.

01:53:37.444 --> 01:53:39.511
You can stay here.

01:54:02.903 --> 01:54:04.369
There.

01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:30.295
Good night, Harvey.

01:55:28.989 --> 01:55:32.124
Look at her,
so innocent and sweet.

01:55:35.262 --> 01:55:37.996
Just like the
little kittens and puppies

01:55:37.998 --> 01:55:42.634
you used to bop on the head
when you were a little tyke.

01:55:42.636 --> 01:55:46.605
My dear boy,
what makes you think

01:55:46.607 --> 01:55:49.374
she's any different.

01:55:49.376 --> 01:55:54.112
She'll soon realize you're
just a giant retard,

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:56.181
an oversized imbecile.

01:55:58.118 --> 01:56:00.719
Nobody knows you like your mama.

01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:08.360
You'll always
be a bad little boy.

01:57:36.183 --> 01:57:38.250
What's going, Ash?

01:57:44.258 --> 01:57:46.324
Gentlemen.

01:57:49.763 --> 01:57:53.131
We got a
special job, very good pay.

01:57:58.138 --> 01:58:00.072
What?

01:58:00.674 --> 01:58:02.741
It's not the usual.

01:58:12.419 --> 01:58:13.618
Little girl?

01:58:14.521 --> 01:58:16.254
Jesus, Ash.

01:58:18.325 --> 01:58:20.725
Hey guys, what are you havin'?

01:58:20.727 --> 01:58:23.829
Johnny Walker,
four fingers, neat.

01:58:23.831 --> 01:58:25.230
Fuzzy Navel.

01:58:29.736 --> 01:58:31.336
Fuzzy Navel?

01:58:31.338 --> 01:58:33.872
I like Fuzzy Navels.

01:58:38.412 --> 01:58:40.612
So we're doing kids now?

01:58:41.882 --> 01:58:44.216
I promised the Belgian.

01:58:45.285 --> 01:58:46.485
Belgian?

01:58:48.322 --> 01:58:50.889
How'd you talk to the Belgian?

01:58:52.126 --> 01:58:54.192
I met with him.

01:58:56.130 --> 01:58:58.196
How do you do that?

01:59:00.767 --> 01:59:03.368
We've been working for him.

01:59:04.204 --> 01:59:05.704
I couldn't tell ya.

01:59:05.706 --> 01:59:09.441
We're on probation.

01:59:11.311 --> 01:59:12.811
Do you know what they
say about that guy.

01:59:12.813 --> 01:59:15.480
It's like urban
legend shit, man.

01:59:16.617 --> 01:59:20.685
I met with him for the
first time the other day.

01:59:20.687 --> 01:59:24.289
And I can tell ya, it ain't
urban legend.

01:59:31.632 --> 01:59:33.431
One Johnny Walker,

01:59:35.702 --> 01:59:37.435
one Fuzzy Navel.

01:59:48.182 --> 01:59:52.450
I was a little taken back
when I saw what happened

01:59:52.452 --> 01:59:54.386
to the shipments.

01:59:54.855 --> 01:59:57.822
Man.

01:59:57.824 --> 02:00:01.426
Look, the less
you two know the better.

02:00:03.730 --> 02:00:06.665
I made a decision,
make more bank.

02:00:09.436 --> 02:00:13.705
You probably know by now,
that ain't no going back.

02:00:14.808 --> 02:00:16.741
We need to go forward.

02:00:18.612 --> 02:00:20.979
When's this got to be done?

02:00:20.981 --> 02:00:22.380
Couple days.

02:00:24.518 --> 02:00:27.385
We have the end of the
month shipment from Calgary

02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:29.721
and I got to be the receiver.

02:00:35.329 --> 02:00:38.463
Money talks,
bullshit walks, right?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.766
Thank you, Ben.

02:00:43.937 --> 02:00:46.605
So, we have plan?

02:00:49.476 --> 02:00:51.410
Yeah.

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:53.345
So this little girl,
she's the niece of a gal

02:00:54.381 --> 02:00:58.450
by the name of Erma Ritz,
one of June's friends.

02:01:01.255 --> 02:01:03.955
Right, that house we
were at the other night.

02:01:03.957 --> 02:01:05.523
Right.

02:01:05.759 --> 02:01:08.426
She works for me now.

02:01:08.428 --> 02:01:10.695
She's out on her first job.

02:01:11.565 --> 02:01:13.865
When she gets back, I tell her

02:01:13.867 --> 02:01:16.668
she needs to make another drop.

02:01:16.670 --> 02:01:19.671
When she leaves, grab the kid.

02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:25.510
How do we
know she's gonna be alone?

02:01:25.512 --> 02:01:30.315
Maybe a babysitter, she might
be at a park or something.

02:01:32.486 --> 02:01:36.388
Anybody at the house
is collateral damage.

02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:40.525
We got to get in get the
job done quick and quiet.

02:01:41.461 --> 02:01:45.697
We'll go in with a couple
of hush-ems as a precaution.

02:01:45.699 --> 02:01:49.467
And if they're not
there, we'll wait.

02:01:49.469 --> 02:01:52.804
When they come
back, grab and go.

02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:07.919
The body at Slough Town
Auto bludgeoned to death.

02:02:07.921 --> 02:02:10.989
May Harv rest in peace.

02:02:12.059 --> 02:02:13.792
Damn fine mechanic.

02:02:15.095 --> 02:02:18.063
State hospital, five bodies.

02:02:18.065 --> 02:02:20.732
One in critical condition.

02:02:20.734 --> 02:02:22.100
This morning,

02:02:22.102 --> 02:02:26.371
three dead teenagers
found in Watson's Field.

02:02:27.341 --> 02:02:30.075
Do you think they're related?

02:02:30.077 --> 02:02:32.944
All within a three mile radius?

02:02:34.514 --> 02:02:36.648
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

02:02:40.821 --> 02:02:42.287
Not doing it.

02:02:42.288 --> 02:02:43.754
So the new guys gets in
there with some tweezers

02:02:43.757 --> 02:02:47.025
and he's just,
he's just yanking at it.

02:02:47.027 --> 02:02:49.427
Get that thing out.

02:02:49.429 --> 02:02:51.863
And I swear it's
like three inches long.

02:02:51.865 --> 02:02:52.964
The biggest dick plug...

02:02:52.966 --> 02:02:54.599
Tell me something,

02:02:55.869 --> 02:02:58.370
do you know
any other small towns

02:02:58.372 --> 02:03:01.973
who have a
coroner's office this big?

02:03:01.975 --> 02:03:06.511
There are eight coroners
out there and four cops.

02:03:06.513 --> 02:03:10.715
Their office is as big as
Seattle's for crying out loud.

02:03:10.717 --> 02:03:13.051
Been with the department
two months now, right?

02:03:13.053 --> 02:03:14.953
Two and a half.

02:03:14.955 --> 02:03:16.688
Two and a half.

02:03:18.158 --> 02:03:20.158
Better get used to it, son.

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:21.993
The town's cursed.

02:03:21.995 --> 02:03:25.163
It's been this
way since it was founded.

02:03:25.165 --> 02:03:27.165
I don't know
what it is about Slough Town

02:03:27.167 --> 02:03:30.802
but it's always attracted
the undesirables,

02:03:30.804 --> 02:03:33.838
white trash,
drug addicts, dealers,

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:38.510
career criminals, prostitution,
smuggling, whack jobs.

02:03:40.414 --> 02:03:45.083
Don't get me wrong, there
are good people here, too.

02:03:45.085 --> 02:03:48.086
But if you wanted to
give the Earth an enema,

02:03:48.088 --> 02:03:50.955
this is where
you'd put the hose.

02:03:52.793 --> 02:03:56.828
I'd be lying if I said stress
didn't come with the job.

02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:59.798
I can tell you
when I first started,

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.567
I was as pretty as you.

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:10.508
We got the scene photos
of the dead teenagers.

02:04:12.179 --> 02:04:15.013
I know these teenagers.

02:04:15.015 --> 02:04:17.515
Fucked up little rich
kids living on the hill

02:04:17.517 --> 02:04:20.051
rebelling against their parents

02:04:21.087 --> 02:04:23.021
who really don't give a shit.

02:04:24.558 --> 02:04:25.890
They were so
involved gutting that cat,

02:04:25.892 --> 02:04:29.227
they didn't even see the
attacker coming.

02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:31.496
Tell you what, one of my
kids ever got involved

02:04:31.498 --> 02:04:36.067
in that Satan worship crap,
I'd beat the shit out of 'em.

02:04:47.881 --> 02:04:51.249
Paul, we need to drive up the
hill and talk to the parents

02:04:51.251 --> 02:04:52.951
of these teenagers.

02:04:53.787 --> 02:04:56.488
I doubt there's any involvement.

02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:59.257
Probably don't even know
their kids are missing.

02:04:59.259 --> 02:05:01.960
But we shouldn't rule it out.

02:05:03.597 --> 02:05:05.864
Hey, Paul, how you doing?

02:05:06.933 --> 02:05:10.768
Considering
the circumstances, swell.

02:05:15.509 --> 02:05:17.075
We can look at the bright side.

02:05:17.077 --> 02:05:19.628
Huh?

02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:22.180
At least Slough Town's cat
population is safe again.

02:05:34.628 --> 02:05:36.194
You are one crazy bastard.

02:05:39.065 --> 02:05:40.899
Oh, excuse me.

02:05:54.848 --> 02:05:58.182
Hello, Lowell,
what can we do for you?

02:05:59.686 --> 02:06:01.819
I got a tenant in my rental,

02:06:01.821 --> 02:06:05.290
I need you to get rid of.

02:06:05.292 --> 02:06:06.558
Erma Ritz.

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:11.596
That bitch is three
months late on her rent.

02:06:12.265 --> 02:06:14.699
And she don't give a shit.

02:06:14.701 --> 02:06:16.301
Have you talked to her?

02:06:16.303 --> 02:06:18.102
When I can find her.

02:06:18.104 --> 02:06:20.922
And when I can,

02:06:20.923 --> 02:06:23.741
she's rude and insulting.

02:06:24.644 --> 02:06:27.045
Two days ago
she was in the cafe.

02:06:27.047 --> 02:06:28.179
I stood up.

02:06:28.181 --> 02:06:30.748
She said I ain't got a penis.

02:06:37.824 --> 02:06:39.891
Hey, Eleanor.

02:06:45.732 --> 02:06:47.131
Yeah, Chief.

02:06:48.702 --> 02:06:50.969
Can you get Lowell here a form?

02:06:50.971 --> 02:06:53.171
He needs to evict someone.

02:06:55.809 --> 02:06:57.875
Absolutely.

02:06:59.279 --> 02:07:01.613
Will you follow me, please.

02:07:09.322 --> 02:07:12.957
Jesus Christ.

02:07:12.959 --> 02:07:15.293
One year, I retire.

02:08:02.108 --> 02:08:03.875
Hi, Harvey.

02:08:27.867 --> 02:08:30.735
I had a dream last night,
Harvey.

02:08:31.404 --> 02:08:33.471
I saw my mom and dad.

02:08:37.143 --> 02:08:40.912
They said they
sent you to protect me.

02:08:41.781 --> 02:08:44.982
My dad always
said the mask was magic.

02:08:48.288 --> 02:08:51.422
Thank you for saving me
yesterday.

02:08:51.424 --> 02:08:53.491
What you did was okay.

02:08:56.129 --> 02:08:59.263
That's what
the Rabbit King would do.

02:09:00.433 --> 02:09:03.301
Bad people
get what they deserve.

02:09:04.437 --> 02:09:06.370
They were bad, Harvey.

02:09:08.041 --> 02:09:11.075
Dying is what enemies do best.

02:09:11.077 --> 02:09:13.945
That's what
the Rabbit King says.

02:09:14.814 --> 02:09:16.881
There, perfect.

02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:30.061
Fan your hands to help them dry.

02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:42.073
Far, far away in an earlier
time in another world

02:09:42.075 --> 02:09:44.442
there was a king of kings.

02:09:44.444 --> 02:09:47.945
He was the
ruler of all kingdoms.

02:09:47.947 --> 02:09:50.214
He was the Rabbit King.

02:09:50.216 --> 02:09:53.951
Dawn had broken waking the
Rabbit King from his slumber,

02:09:53.953 --> 02:09:58.890
but was not in the morning.

02:10:12.105 --> 02:10:14.172
Harvey.

02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:09.053
Hello?

02:14:26.659 --> 02:14:28.726
Ow!

02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:45.669
Hi, Harvey.

02:15:59.852 --> 02:16:01.919
I miss Mom and Dad.

02:16:11.764 --> 02:16:13.564
My head hurts.

02:21:20.139 --> 02:21:23.907
Were you laughing at me?

02:21:59.879 --> 02:22:01.945
Harvey.

02:22:19.565 --> 02:22:20.964
This is Harvey.

02:22:22.001 --> 02:22:23.734
He's my friend.

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:26.603
He protects me.

02:22:27.806 --> 02:22:30.874
If you hurt me, he'll hurt you.

02:22:32.177 --> 02:22:34.845
If you are mean, he is mean.

02:22:37.016 --> 02:22:39.650
You are mean, Aunt Erma.

02:23:16.055 --> 02:23:18.121
Harvey?

02:23:22.227 --> 02:23:24.962
What did you do?

02:23:32.004 --> 02:23:34.304
June is nice.

02:23:34.306 --> 02:23:36.940
She didn't do anything bad.

02:23:37.810 --> 02:23:40.210
Why did you do that?

02:23:40.212 --> 02:23:42.379
This isn't good, Harvey.

02:23:42.381 --> 02:23:43.981
Bad.

02:24:40.305 --> 02:24:43.940
She was probably bad, huh,
Harvey?

02:24:59.391 --> 02:25:01.758
Good morning, Paul.

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:02.760
Mornin', lady.

02:25:03.996 --> 02:25:06.196
The eviction
notice for Erma Ritz.

02:25:06.198 --> 02:25:08.265
Thanks, Eleanor.

02:25:10.102 --> 02:25:12.335
On 60 First Avenue.

02:25:12.337 --> 02:25:13.770
Good morning, Chief.

02:25:13.772 --> 02:25:15.338
Apartment 18, C like in Charles.

02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:17.207
Good morning, Eleanor.

02:25:17.209 --> 02:25:19.126
18C 10.

02:25:19.127 --> 02:25:21.044
740 in five,
facing units that have come

02:25:21.046 --> 02:25:22.779
on the extra sirens.

02:25:22.781 --> 02:25:24.448
We're leaving.

02:25:25.451 --> 02:25:28.118
Couple of hikers found a body.

02:25:29.455 --> 02:25:31.905
Swell.

02:25:31.906 --> 02:25:34.356
Some guy fishing, took a
Bowie knife through the chest.

02:25:34.359 --> 02:25:35.492
Man.

02:25:36.095 --> 02:25:38.061
Possibly our guy.

02:25:38.063 --> 02:25:41.865
Single stab
through the chest plate.

02:25:41.867 --> 02:25:43.901
Hysterical strength.

02:25:43.902 --> 02:25:45.936
740 in five,
facing units that have come...

02:25:45.938 --> 02:25:47.337
What's that?

02:25:47.339 --> 02:25:50.006
The eviction
notice for Erma Ritz.

02:25:50.008 --> 02:25:52.909
I was meeting Lowell at
the rental to serve her.

02:25:52.911 --> 02:25:54.044
Hmm.

02:25:54.046 --> 02:25:56.780
We can do it on the way.

02:25:56.782 --> 02:25:59.049
Body ain't going anywhere.

02:25:59.051 --> 02:26:00.350
Uh, what's the job?

02:26:50.969 --> 02:26:53.970
Harvey,
can you get me some milk?

02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:35.338
What are you doing here?

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:38.408
I live here with Erma.

02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:40.477
You, what?, what.

02:28:41.513 --> 02:28:44.514
What the fuck. Where's Erma?

02:28:45.517 --> 02:28:48.385
There's a dead Jap lady

02:28:48.387 --> 02:28:50.453
and a hooker in my shed.

02:28:52.357 --> 02:28:55.392
You stay here,
the cops are coming.

02:29:40.706 --> 02:29:43.306
No, go to your house.

02:29:54.286 --> 02:29:55.719
No.

02:30:22.614 --> 02:30:24.681
Everybody dies.

02:31:26.745 --> 02:31:29.412
Holy shit.

02:31:36.288 --> 02:31:38.488
You all right, sweetheart?

02:32:49.294 --> 02:32:52.262
That's Ash Walker's car.

02:32:54.633 --> 02:32:56.366
Who's Ash Walker?

02:32:57.569 --> 02:33:00.503
Mr. Walker's
a clever son of a bitch.

02:33:00.505 --> 02:33:03.273
I've been
watching him for years.

02:33:03.275 --> 02:33:06.876
Never been
able to get anything on him.

02:33:06.878 --> 02:33:10.346
You ever see that car,
you know something bad

02:33:10.348 --> 02:33:11.714
is going down.

02:33:14.219 --> 02:33:16.286
I'll go up with you.

02:33:45.317 --> 02:33:47.517
Paul, go around the house,

02:33:49.721 --> 02:33:51.521
come through the back door.

02:35:02.827 --> 02:35:04.560
Are you okay?

02:35:04.562 --> 02:35:07.430
There are bad men here.

02:35:07.432 --> 02:35:08.998
How many are there?

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:10.366
Two.

02:35:11.036 --> 02:35:13.936
You're the
girl from the car accident.

02:35:13.938 --> 02:35:15.672
Do you remember me?

02:35:20.578 --> 02:35:24.047
Stay right
where you are, Mr. Walker.

02:35:24.049 --> 02:35:28.551
I will not hesitate to
put a bullet in your head.

02:35:28.553 --> 02:35:33.623
Drop the gun and hold your
hands up where I can see them.

02:35:33.925 --> 02:35:35.825
I didn't do that.

02:35:40.699 --> 02:35:43.833
Drop the gun
and put up your hands.

02:35:58.883 --> 02:36:01.751
Sweetheart, I need you to
run down to the patrol car

02:36:01.753 --> 02:36:03.386
and lock yourself in.

02:36:03.388 --> 02:36:04.388
Just down the...

02:37:34.612 --> 02:37:35.678
Fuck!

02:39:34.265 --> 02:39:35.331
Nina?

02:39:39.671 --> 02:39:40.736
Nina?

02:39:41.606 --> 02:39:43.072
Are you all right?

02:39:44.042 --> 02:39:45.107
Sydney?

02:39:46.678 --> 02:39:48.744
You shouldn't be here.

02:39:50.014 --> 02:39:51.647
What?

02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:59.055
Well, well, well, if it
isn't Little Miss Muffin

02:39:59.057 --> 02:40:01.257
and her Fairy Grandmother.

02:40:07.932 --> 02:40:11.000
What is this,
Grand Central Station?

02:40:11.936 --> 02:40:14.136
As chief engineer, I'd
like to invite you two in

02:40:14.138 --> 02:40:16.105
for a tea party.

02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:21.310
You aren't very talkative, are
you, Red.

02:40:24.916 --> 02:40:27.049
Right over here, darlin'.

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:31.087
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, where's the fire?

02:40:31.089 --> 02:40:33.789
Hold on there,
Red, don't go just yet.

02:40:33.791 --> 02:40:36.792
Every Jane needs a Tarzan.

02:41:03.921 --> 02:41:06.389
No, Harvey, leave her alone.

02:42:41.352 --> 02:42:43.119
Mother fucker!

02:43:45.850 --> 02:43:47.917
I'll get the trunk.

02:44:06.037 --> 02:44:08.103
Home sweet home.

02:44:24.589 --> 02:44:28.123
You can put your
things down over there.

02:44:32.296 --> 02:44:34.897
This was my husband's office.

02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:38.367
He left a few years ago.

02:44:42.506 --> 02:44:43.906
Those are his.

02:44:46.911 --> 02:44:50.246
He always bought
them, never built them.

02:44:52.116 --> 02:44:55.417
The futon folds out into a bed.

02:44:55.419 --> 02:44:57.519
And I have some kids coming
from the center tomorrow

02:44:57.521 --> 02:44:59.521
to help clean this place up

02:44:59.523 --> 02:45:01.523
so you can start fresh.

02:45:02.426 --> 02:45:03.993
Okay.

02:45:03.995 --> 02:45:06.262
How do you like the room?

02:45:07.265 --> 02:45:08.330
It's fine.

02:45:08.332 --> 02:45:10.933
It'll take some getting used to.

02:45:10.935 --> 02:45:14.536
I've always shared a
room with another girl.

02:45:15.573 --> 02:45:18.908
It's different from the
hospital.

02:45:18.910 --> 02:45:20.242
I can imagine.

02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:24.280
It's gonna take time

02:45:24.282 --> 02:45:26.048
and some adjustment.

02:45:27.652 --> 02:45:29.051
We'll get you into some programs

02:45:29.053 --> 02:45:31.120
that'll help fine-tune your
social skills

02:45:31.122 --> 02:45:33.188
and help you find a job.

02:45:39.063 --> 02:45:41.497
We'll see if we can get you

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:43.932
into some community college
classes, too.

02:45:43.935 --> 02:45:46.001
That sounds good.

02:45:47.505 --> 02:45:51.006
I'm gonna go make some lunch.

02:45:51.008 --> 02:45:53.075
Feel free to settle in.

02:45:53.978 --> 02:45:57.379
It'll be nice having someone
else around.

02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:12.094
The young queen
would never forget the day

02:46:12.096 --> 02:46:15.164
her father,
the Rabbit King, died.

02:46:16.067 --> 02:46:20.502
He laid to rest in her arms
knowing it was his time

02:46:20.504 --> 02:46:23.605
to move on to the other world.

02:46:23.607 --> 02:46:27.309
It was time to say
goodbye to his daughter.

02:46:27.311 --> 02:46:32.147
And in comfort knowing she
would carry on his legacy

02:46:32.149 --> 02:46:34.216
as the new queen.

02:46:36.187 --> 02:46:40.089
Many years had passed since
the quietus of the Rabbit King

02:46:40.091 --> 02:46:43.225
and the princess
had become queen

02:46:43.227 --> 02:46:45.494
all those years past.

02:46:45.496 --> 02:46:49.631
She had been alone to run
the kingdom on her own.

02:46:51.402 --> 02:46:54.169
At times,
she would look out the window

02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:58.073
from her tower
overlooking her kingdom.

02:46:58.075 --> 02:47:02.011
It was a daunting task,
having so much burden.

02:47:03.114 --> 02:47:08.183
She missed her father and at
times her heart would sink.

02:47:23.167 --> 02:47:25.234
How are things going?

02:47:33.611 --> 02:47:34.593
Fine.

02:47:34.594 --> 02:47:35.954
I hope you
like bologna sandwiches.

02:47:40.117 --> 02:47:43.118
Bologna sandwiches sound great.

02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:44.119
Great.

02:47:44.121 --> 02:47:45.821
Five minutes.

02:47:45.823 --> 02:47:48.524
Before the
Rabbit King had passed,

02:47:48.526 --> 02:47:52.127
the young queen would always
remember that one thing

02:47:52.129 --> 02:47:55.164
he always said
to her with that twinkle

02:47:55.166 --> 02:47:57.399
in his eye.

02:47:57.401 --> 02:48:01.070
"Never fear as
I am always in your heart."

02:48:02.073 --> 02:48:04.606
"For love is stronger than evil."

02:48:05.443 --> 02:48:09.611
"Always hold me in your
heart as I do with you"

02:48:09.613 --> 02:48:12.748
"and I will
always find my way to you"

02:48:14.852 --> 02:48:19.088
"for we will
always be beloved beasts."
