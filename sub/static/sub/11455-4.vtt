00:23.200 --> 00:24.300
Yes...

But I'd like to use a condom.

Let me fix this.

00:35.766 --> 00:36.699
How?

00:36.766 --> 00:37.699
Trust me.

00:37.766 --> 00:39.132
This is how things move.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.300
Don't lecture me on how things move!

What were you gonna do?

00:45.800 --> 00:47.300
I don't wanna bring you into this.

00:47.366 --> 00:48.799
Do you come to town often or...?

00:48.866 --> 00:50.299
No, not very often.

00:50.366 --> 00:52.966
Although that could change.

00:53.366 --> 00:54.299
Why is that?

00:54.366 --> 00:55.866
Because of you.

01:11.066 --> 01:12.366
Sorry.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.266
Are you okay?

01:30.866 --> 01:32.099
Well...

01:35.066 --> 01:36.466
What's going on?

01:41.866 --> 01:43.299

I make...

01:53.000 --> 01:54.133
okay money,

01:54.200 --> 01:56.066
but...

01:56.133 --> 01:59.099
probably not as much
as your other clients.

02:01.066 --> 02:04.432
I'm having a hard time to come up

02:04.500 --> 02:06.433
with money to see you.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.366
I've started to taking out loans...

02:12.333 --> 02:14.566
I'm sorry.

02:14.633 --> 02:17.433
I don't mean to make you uncomfortable,

02:18.266 --> 02:21.132
but it would tear me up

02:21.200 --> 02:23.266
if I could not see you again.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.133
Okay...

02:25.200 --> 02:28.066
um, why don't we maybe
try seeing each other

02:28.133 --> 02:29.433
a little bit less?

02:35.433 --> 02:37.533
Can you lower...

02:38.433 --> 02:40.133
your rate a little bit?

02:42.066 --> 02:43.532
I'm in love with you.

02:44.066 --> 02:46.132
Kevin...

02:46.200 --> 02:49.966
You're putting me in a very
uncomfortable position.

02:50.433 --> 02:51.466
I know.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.033
I'm sorry.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.799
Um...

03:01.232 --> 03:05.198
What if I take some time and
figure out some kind of, um,

03:05.265 --> 03:07.065
an arrangement that...

03:07.865 --> 03:09.231
works for both of us,

03:09.299 --> 03:11.465
and- and keeps us together?

03:15.232 --> 03:16.398
Really?

03:19.265 --> 03:20.831
Thank you.

03:21.265 --> 03:22.898
Oh, thank you.

- Hi.

03:44.865 --> 03:46.431
- How you doing, teeny?
- Good.

03:46.499 --> 03:47.665
Yeah?

03:49.065 --> 03:49.998
How was your trip?

03:50.065 --> 03:50.998
It was good.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.665
I just got off the phone with Mom.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.232
She gave me this massive guilt
trip about getting to see you.

03:55.299 --> 03:56.999
She can come visit.

03:57.065 --> 03:58.931
Yeah, I know, but maybe
you can call her?

03:58.999 --> 04:00.665
I call her all the time.

04:00.799 --> 04:03.265
I don't believe you. You're
being too defensive.

04:03.332 --> 04:04.732
Shit, I smell.

04:04.799 --> 04:07.365
...And then we broke into
groups and we talked about

04:07.432 --> 04:09.065
our fears and our goals...

04:09.132 --> 04:10.432
And then you fell into
each other's arms,

04:10.499 --> 04:13.099
and did trust exercises
with all the DAs.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.231
Okay, well we didn't
do- we didn't do that,

04:15.299 --> 04:17.365
we didn't fall into each other's arms.

04:17.432 --> 04:20.432
- But you did trust exercises?
- Yes!

04:20.499 --> 04:23.299
It- you're making it sound way
cheesier than it actually is.

04:23.365 --> 04:26.365
- It's very good for communication in
my department. - Is this the same, um,

04:26.432 --> 04:28.932
retreat the DAs went on last year

04:28.999 --> 04:30.265
where they went zip-lining?

04:30.332 --> 04:32.165
No, it's not.

04:32.232 --> 04:35.298
But that was also very fun,
and very helpful for us.

04:35.365 --> 04:37.298
Right, I can see how that's helpful.

04:38.499 --> 04:40.999
You realize your guys' job
is to put people in prison?

04:41.065 --> 04:44.065
Yeah, our job is to put
bad people in prison.

04:45.332 --> 04:47.265
Yeah, I remember feeling
like it was a formality

04:47.332 --> 04:48.432
at a certain point.

04:48.499 --> 04:50.232
Yeah, I'm definitely
learning more in the firm

04:50.299 --> 04:51.799
than in class or studying.

04:51.865 --> 04:54.165
- I know, you'll get there.
- I know.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.965
I know you know. You're so defensive.

05:02.232 --> 05:05.332
So, are you still dating Jake?

05:05.399 --> 05:08.499
- I was never dating Jake.
- Of course you were dating Jake.

05:08.565 --> 05:11.865
I wasn't saying that
he was your boyfriend.

05:11.932 --> 05:15.632
I just found him to be too available.

05:15.699 --> 05:19.099
I just don't enjoy spending time
with people, I find it to be...

05:19.165 --> 05:20.831
a waste of time, and
it makes me anxious.

05:20.899 --> 05:22.832
(LAUGHS)

05:22.899 --> 05:25.332
Well, maybe you just didn't like Jake.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.499
No, I just don't like
sharing my time with anyone

05:27.565 --> 05:29.498
unless something's being accomplished.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.965
You're really selfish.

05:35.432 --> 05:37.065
Hey, you're fine.

05:37.132 --> 05:38.198
Thanks.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.265
No wait, I'm- I'm sorry, I
understand, I- I get it...

05:43.332 --> 05:44.332
You value your time.

05:44.399 --> 05:45.532
Exactly.

05:47.499 --> 05:49.865
Well, speaking of, uh,

05:49.932 --> 05:52.265
I was going to stay the weekend.

05:52.332 --> 05:55.132
Um, I don't know what
you have planned, um,

05:56.432 --> 05:59.165
but I'd love to hang out with you.

06:03.959 --> 06:04.892
It's okay.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.025
I know I just sprung that on you.

06:07.092 --> 06:10.225
I'm just slammed. I wouldn't
even be around but...

06:10.292 --> 06:12.525
Yeah, that's fine, it's fine.

06:12.592 --> 06:15.258
Seriously, I- I understand
how second-year law is.

06:15.326 --> 06:16.259
You don't have to explain it to me.

06:16.326 --> 06:17.392
- No, I got it.
- You sure?

06:17.459 --> 06:18.959
I got it, yeah.

06:19.026 --> 06:21.026
Who else am I going to spend
my massive salary on?

06:24.026 --> 06:26.192
No, I'm listening to you.

06:26.259 --> 06:27.692
Yeah...

06:28.959 --> 06:30.992
No, I'm happy for you, no-

06:33.292 --> 06:34.858
She hung up.

06:36.259 --> 06:39.025
Can you believe it? She hung up on me.

06:39.092 --> 06:41.225
Maybe the phone lost reception.

06:43.092 --> 06:46.058
No, she wants to do another
real estate venture.

06:46.126 --> 06:48.392
- How many has she done already?
- You know, well...

06:48.459 --> 06:50.759
This time it's condos in San Diego.

06:50.826 --> 06:52.392
I don't know what to say.

06:54.326 --> 06:57.159
...We don't talk anymore.
I never talk to her.

06:57.226 --> 07:00.192
The only time I talk to her
is when she wants money.

07:01.026 --> 07:02.459
It's all my fault.

07:02.526 --> 07:04.092
'Cause I shoulda...

07:04.892 --> 07:06.525
I shoulda established no!

07:06.592 --> 07:09.292
- I shoulda told her no.
- What's no?

07:13.959 --> 07:16.325
I bet you were a handful for your daddy.

07:18.259 --> 07:20.392
- Still are probably.
- No...

07:20.459 --> 07:23.092
- Huh?
- No, we, we get along really well.

07:26.592 --> 07:29.225
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

07:33.192 --> 07:36.492
What I should do is I should
just stay here with you.

07:37.259 --> 07:38.325
I'd love that.

07:38.392 --> 07:39.925
Well, I'd be happy.

has anything to do with me.

I'm avoiding drunk Tariq.

10:36.025 --> 10:38.025
Thanks for the honesty.

10:38.092 --> 10:39.792
I'm always honest.

10:39.858 --> 10:40.824
Always?

10:40.892 --> 10:41.958
Never.

10:42.592 --> 10:43.592
You?

10:44.025 --> 10:44.991
Sometimes.

10:47.825 --> 10:50.825
I can get you a ziplock
bag, if you need one.

10:50.892 --> 10:52.958
- I've got one right in the kitchen.
- I'm good.

10:55.858 --> 10:56.958
Do I look that desperate?

10:57.025 --> 10:58.591
Honestly...

10:58.892 --> 11:00.392
Yes.

11:00.525 --> 11:02.791
But you said you're never honest.

11:04.092 --> 11:05.692
I am when it matters.

11:05.758 --> 11:07.158
I'll hold you to that.

Right, because he's- when he said-

11:30.925 --> 11:33.658
When he says it in that room...

11:35.587 --> 11:37.687
It's not that he doesn't mean it,
it's that he's not committing to it.

11:37.754 --> 11:38.820
There's a big difference.

11:38.887 --> 11:41.320
So, are you seeing anyone else?

11:41.387 --> 11:42.820
Like outside of work?

11:42.887 --> 11:44.520
Like a real boyfriend?

11:44.587 --> 11:46.520
No.

11:46.587 --> 11:49.520
I've actually never really
had a "real boyfriend".

11:49.587 --> 11:50.620
Why not?

11:52.254 --> 11:53.620
Well I dunno, I guess as
soon as I sort of realized

11:53.687 --> 11:56.620
there was such a thing
as me and other people,

11:56.687 --> 11:58.387
I kind of...

12:00.939 --> 12:03.472
I guess I just- I don't...

12:03.547 --> 12:06.747
have the same, you know,
reactions to things or...

12:08.480 --> 12:12.413
feelings about the way
things are supposed to be.

12:15.413 --> 12:16.879
Does that make any sense at all?

12:16.947 --> 12:18.547
It makes total sense.
