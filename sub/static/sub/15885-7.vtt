15:10.010 --> 15:11.643
I'M A PRESIDENT, Y'ALL!

15:11.645 --> 15:14.178

15:41.174 --> 15:42.240
'CAUSE IT'S
PRETTY AMAZING, MAN.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.841
IT'S AWESOME. ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS PICK UP THE PHONE

15:43.843 --> 15:46.077
AND SAY, "EXCUSE ME, I'D LIKE
TO ORDER TWO DEAD TERRORISTS."

15:46.079 --> 15:47.345

IN YOUR HEAD?

16:11.438 --> 16:14.639
WHY WOULD YOU COMPARE
THE PRESIDENT

16:14.641 --> 16:18.209
TO ONE
OF THE LORDS OF THE SITH?

16:20.012 --> 16:22.113
