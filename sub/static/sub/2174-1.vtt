02:03.967 --> 02:06.265
Ninety-one, 92...

02:06.470 --> 02:08.937
- It's down there.
- Where? If they catch us...

02:09.139 --> 02:11.107
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

02:11.308 --> 02:12.707
You think they're
gonna miss one?

02:28.058 --> 02:30.151
Weather is with us, sir.

02:30.527 --> 02:33.724
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

02:33.931 --> 02:35.489
Very good.

02:35.699 --> 02:37.462
You're welcome, sir.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.469
Man, I never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

02:46.677 --> 02:49.908
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

02:50.113 --> 02:51.410
Hey, look.

02:52.549 --> 02:54.380
I'll give you a hand.

03:00.624 --> 03:04.082
- Thought you said it was booze.
- That's what the papers said.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.261
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

03:11.468 --> 03:13.026
- Which section?
- 101.

03:13.904 --> 03:15.201
Fuck. Take the wheel.

03:15.405 --> 03:16.804
- Yes, sir.
- Fuck.

03:18.876 --> 03:21.071
Close the door! Get the masks.

03:27.317 --> 03:29.444
Holy shit.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.111
Take care of them.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.295
- Morning.
- Passport, please.

04:24.975 --> 04:25.964
Rough seas?

04:26.576 --> 04:29.841
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what I mean.

04:30.047 --> 04:31.571
- Ibiza.
- Yeah.

04:31.782 --> 04:33.215
Thanks.

04:43.827 --> 04:46.625
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

04:46.830 --> 04:50.061
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

04:51.201 --> 04:54.637
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

05:19.463 --> 05:20.794
Security check.

05:21.198 --> 05:22.790
Do I look like a security risk?

05:23.100 --> 05:26.126
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

05:27.004 --> 05:28.562
My documents are right here, sir.

05:28.772 --> 05:30.899
The computer is in the office.

05:32.442 --> 05:33.636
Her too.

05:33.844 --> 05:35.505
She's sleeping.

05:35.712 --> 05:38.476
- With her documents.
- Okay, sure.

05:53.397 --> 05:54.523
You're gonna lose it.

05:59.036 --> 06:00.731
Close, inspector, you're close.

06:05.575 --> 06:07.543
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

06:10.147 --> 06:11.910
Don't let him get away.

06:16.586 --> 06:17.848
You're close.

06:23.226 --> 06:24.716
Go left, go left! Go right!

06:28.465 --> 06:30.626
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

06:30.834 --> 06:31.892
No, thank you, Frank.

06:33.236 --> 06:36.467
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

06:41.845 --> 06:45.246
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

06:48.819 --> 06:52.482
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

06:52.823 --> 06:56.224
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

06:56.426 --> 06:59.554
- Jerry Lewis is a genius.
- Dean was the genius.

06:59.763 --> 07:02.823
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

07:03.033 --> 07:06.002
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

07:06.203 --> 07:09.434
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

07:20.450 --> 07:24.181
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

07:24.387 --> 07:25.854
There is a mess in Marseilles.

07:26.056 --> 07:28.923
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

07:31.495 --> 07:33.395
Don't look at me.

07:33.597 --> 07:36.464
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

07:36.666 --> 07:40.830
But I will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

07:42.372 --> 07:44.237
As usual.

07:49.913 --> 07:51.141
Tarconi!

07:52.516 --> 07:53.949
- Please!
- I am sorry, Frank.

07:54.151 --> 07:57.245
- It's our first bite!
- Yeah, yeah.

07:57.988 --> 07:59.853
- Please.
- Yeah.

08:00.056 --> 08:01.523
Stop the boat. Come on.

08:01.725 --> 08:04.455
- No. No, Frank.
- Come on, please.

08:44.701 --> 08:48.262
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

08:49.039 --> 08:50.028
Business.

08:50.607 --> 08:51.835
What kind of business?

08:52.442 --> 08:54.239
Environmental protection.

09:01.151 --> 09:02.243
Thank you.

09:04.588 --> 09:07.921
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

09:08.124 --> 09:10.854
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

09:11.061 --> 09:13.791
- What is top on your list of priorities?
- It's a short list.

09:13.997 --> 09:16.727
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.730
In the face of increasing pressure...

09:18.935 --> 09:21.870
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

09:22.072 --> 09:25.405
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

09:25.609 --> 09:28.578
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

09:28.778 --> 09:30.473
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

09:30.680 --> 09:33.877
...I have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

09:37.587 --> 09:39.782
- Your speech for tomorrow.
- Any good?

09:40.323 --> 09:44.191
- It's going to piss off a lot of people.
- Excellent.

10:07.317 --> 10:08.306
Hello?

10:09.519 --> 10:11.282
Mr. Minister?

10:12.322 --> 10:13.311
Who is this?

10:13.723 --> 10:16.021
My name is not important.

10:16.226 --> 10:18.456
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

10:18.662 --> 10:21.062
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

10:21.264 --> 10:24.529
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

10:24.734 --> 10:27.202
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-ls.

10:27.404 --> 10:29.463
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

10:29.673 --> 10:32.073
I think you will reconsider
that position...

10:32.275 --> 10:35.676
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

10:50.593 --> 10:52.561
I'll be in touch.

11:33.870 --> 11:36.168
Yeah, there's been an accident.

11:36.539 --> 11:39.872
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

11:58.328 --> 11:59.693
Malcolm.

11:59.896 --> 12:01.557
Malcolm. Malcolm.

12:07.704 --> 12:10.138
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

12:10.340 --> 12:14.401
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

12:14.944 --> 12:16.775
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.641
Your boss got his facts wrong.

12:21.050 --> 12:23.041
Two things you should know
about my boss:

12:23.253 --> 12:26.484
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.714
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.427
Well, not this time.

12:46.676 --> 12:48.735
You don't wanna do this.

12:48.945 --> 12:52.881
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what I do and don't wanna do.

12:53.082 --> 12:56.051
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

13:00.457 --> 13:03.824
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.813
Malcolm. Malcolm.

14:06.022 --> 14:07.011
You hear me?

14:09.692 --> 14:12.024
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean...

14:12.395 --> 14:15.091
- Nowhere else to go.
- Just take it easy, okay?

14:16.799 --> 14:18.027
Don't move me from the car.

14:18.234 --> 14:22.193
- It's just till the ambulance arrives.
- No ambulance.

14:23.072 --> 14:26.007
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

14:27.911 --> 14:30.379
Not far from car.

14:31.881 --> 14:32.939
Relax.

14:33.316 --> 14:37.946
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

14:48.965 --> 14:50.990
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

14:55.572 --> 14:56.561
Sir?

14:56.773 --> 14:59.970
- You wanna be careful moving him.
- We know our job, okay?

15:00.176 --> 15:02.667
Sir, can you hear me?

15:02.879 --> 15:04.403
This car... No...

15:04.614 --> 15:06.138
If you hear me, press my hand.

15:06.583 --> 15:07.880
The car...

15:58.067 --> 16:00.035
Am I in heaven?

16:00.770 --> 16:02.704
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

16:03.373 --> 16:05.864
You'll help me out of it?

16:06.576 --> 16:08.305
That depends on
how deep you're in.

16:08.678 --> 16:11.806
- Don't trust anyone.
- Couldn't agree with you more.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.608
- Come on.
- No! Don't leave the car!

16:15.818 --> 16:18.981
- What's so special about the car?
- Not the car.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.964
Wait!

17:01.764 --> 17:02.753
I told you.

17:07.904 --> 17:09.666
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

17:11.273 --> 17:12.763
<i>I told you.</i>

18:05.294 --> 18:07.421
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

18:07.630 --> 18:09.791
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

18:09.999 --> 18:12.661
Correct. But I'm not working.

18:13.202 --> 18:16.296
- You see, boss? I told you.
- Please, Joseph.

18:17.006 --> 18:20.965
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

18:21.177 --> 18:22.735
Thank you.

18:23.412 --> 18:24.401
As I was saying...

18:24.614 --> 18:27.742
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.384
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

18:30.586 --> 18:32.110
He proved to be ineffective.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.586
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

18:35.792 --> 18:38.090
The way I see it, you're responsible.

18:38.594 --> 18:40.619
I understand your point of view.

18:40.830 --> 18:42.024
But I'm still unavailable.

18:44.033 --> 18:45.500
Boss, can I say something?

18:48.337 --> 18:50.567
Anyone else wanna say something?

18:53.709 --> 18:55.233
Good.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.536
Find me a smarter one.

18:59.882 --> 19:01.907
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

19:02.118 --> 19:04.882
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.079
One.

19:09.358 --> 19:10.347
Two.

19:13.563 --> 19:14.655
One condition.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.290
I'm listening.

19:20.002 --> 19:22.197
I drive my own car.

19:23.506 --> 19:24.973
Deal.

19:28.277 --> 19:31.678
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

19:31.881 --> 19:35.817
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

19:36.018 --> 19:39.545
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

19:39.755 --> 19:42.019
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

19:42.225 --> 19:44.090
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

19:44.527 --> 19:48.520
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

19:51.267 --> 19:53.701
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

19:53.903 --> 19:58.567
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

20:00.610 --> 20:03.443
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

20:03.646 --> 20:05.705
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

20:05.915 --> 20:08.645
You don't like names. Neither do I.
We're both precise.

20:08.851 --> 20:11.945
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

20:12.154 --> 20:16.113
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

20:24.300 --> 20:25.927
You forgot one.

20:26.535 --> 20:29.436
- I work alone.
- I thought you might like the company.

20:29.906 --> 20:32.204
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

20:34.443 --> 20:36.240
You're right. I do.

20:39.015 --> 20:40.209
Wait.

20:42.118 --> 20:44.052
What, you wanna change the rules?

20:45.655 --> 20:48.419
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

20:51.661 --> 20:52.821
You're the boss.

20:55.598 --> 20:57.589
Anything else?

20:58.267 --> 21:00.064
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

21:03.739 --> 21:06.367
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

21:06.575 --> 21:09.408
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

21:09.612 --> 21:11.512
Same principle, just refined.

21:11.714 --> 21:13.409
Twenty-five feet from the car...

21:13.616 --> 21:17.017
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

21:17.219 --> 21:19.016
Fifty feet, orange.

21:19.822 --> 21:21.551
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

21:21.757 --> 21:24.726
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

21:29.966 --> 21:31.729
Time to go.

21:32.234 --> 21:35.931
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

21:37.006 --> 21:40.874
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

21:41.978 --> 21:44.947
Money for gas and food.

21:45.147 --> 21:46.341
Any other questions?

22:17.980 --> 22:20.141
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

22:31.060 --> 22:34.223
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

22:40.036 --> 22:41.936
Great.

22:57.653 --> 23:00.213
<i>Ocean Pearl</i>
requesting cargo clearance.

23:01.924 --> 23:04.415
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

23:04.827 --> 23:06.727
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.557
- <i>We'll inform you when they're signed.</i>
- Okay.

23:19.141 --> 23:20.836
I know what happened to you.

23:21.043 --> 23:23.273
But what happened to Frank?

23:29.018 --> 23:33.114
Colonel Medved over at Intelligence
has been given all the information.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.120
He knows it's top priority.

23:35.324 --> 23:37.884
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

23:38.094 --> 23:40.255
He'll keep it out of official channels.

23:40.463 --> 23:44.126
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

24:39.588 --> 24:44.287
Look, I don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And I don't really care.

24:44.493 --> 24:46.791
You were here first,
you know more than I do...

24:46.996 --> 24:48.691
...download me on what you know.

24:48.898 --> 24:50.456
I know nothing.

24:50.666 --> 24:52.861
How did you know Malcolm?

24:53.302 --> 24:54.291
I didn't.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.737
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

24:59.909 --> 25:02.002
I'm now in a car
with man I don't know.

25:03.879 --> 25:06.507
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

25:12.888 --> 25:14.355
<i>Nice to hear from you.</i>

25:14.557 --> 25:17.617
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

25:17.960 --> 25:19.587
<i>1- 1- 2-6.</i>

25:23.832 --> 25:26.232
<i>Call me when you arrive.</i>

25:28.037 --> 25:30.403
What's in Budapest?

25:30.606 --> 25:32.870
Goulash. Beer.

25:39.882 --> 25:41.110
All right.

25:41.317 --> 25:44.115
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

25:44.753 --> 25:47.278
What happened
to the rule of no names?

25:47.489 --> 25:50.549
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

25:53.629 --> 25:55.824
I'm Frank Martin.

25:58.133 --> 25:59.566
And your name is?

26:02.771 --> 26:05.137
What matters, my name?

26:05.741 --> 26:08.642
Well, we're in this situation together.

26:09.211 --> 26:10.735
No.

26:13.415 --> 26:17.146
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.254
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

26:20.723 --> 26:23.283
It's not. They are going to kill you.

26:25.294 --> 26:27.285
I'm aware of that.

26:28.264 --> 26:31.256
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

26:31.467 --> 26:34.994
Now, if I'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

26:35.204 --> 26:37.832
From the top. We have this problem.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.008
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

26:40.476 --> 26:42.341
I look stupid to you?

26:43.045 --> 26:45.536
I didn't say you were stupid.

26:47.283 --> 26:48.648
But we have a problem...

26:48.851 --> 26:52.514
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

26:54.189 --> 26:56.453
I don't want to talk anymore.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.094
Fine.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.209
What did you say your name was?

27:21.183 --> 27:24.152
Frank. Frank Martin.

27:25.154 --> 27:27.281
Frank Martin.

27:27.656 --> 27:29.681
Valentina.

27:32.761 --> 27:35.252
Pleased to meet you.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.414
<i>The gentlemen</i>
<i>from Ecocorp are here.</i>

28:34.890 --> 28:36.050
Show them in.

28:43.866 --> 28:44.855
Gentlemen.

28:48.137 --> 28:49.661
Mr. Minister.

28:49.872 --> 28:52.739
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

28:52.941 --> 28:55.876
...on such short notice.
- You make it very hard not to.

28:56.078 --> 28:59.707
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

29:00.649 --> 29:02.116
Here are the contracts.

29:03.986 --> 29:05.044
All in order.

29:05.888 --> 29:07.913
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

29:08.123 --> 29:10.114
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

29:10.325 --> 29:11.656
Ships?

29:12.227 --> 29:13.660
I thought there was only one.

29:13.862 --> 29:16.330
Oh, well, here's the thing.

29:16.532 --> 29:19.262
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

29:19.468 --> 29:22.437
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

29:22.638 --> 29:24.265
How many ships
are we talking about?

29:24.473 --> 29:28.239
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

29:28.877 --> 29:30.071
Eight.

29:30.446 --> 29:31.606
This year.

29:32.881 --> 29:35.907
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

29:36.118 --> 29:38.109
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

29:38.320 --> 29:40.845
And I will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

29:41.056 --> 29:43.923
...where I will sign these.

29:44.893 --> 29:47.657
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

29:47.863 --> 29:52.232
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

29:52.434 --> 29:54.595
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

29:54.803 --> 29:57.169
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

29:57.940 --> 30:00.636
No, of course not.

30:00.843 --> 30:04.836
Then I will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

30:10.719 --> 30:12.118
<i>Yes.</i>

30:12.321 --> 30:14.050
Okay, I'll stay.

30:14.256 --> 30:15.883
- But the material is leaking.
- <i>And?</i>

30:16.091 --> 30:18.651
- We won't be able to hide it.
- <i>I'll take care of it.</i>

30:18.861 --> 30:20.158
If ever they check...

30:20.362 --> 30:22.660
<i>Easy. The deal will be closed</i>
<i>very soon.</i>

30:22.865 --> 30:24.492
Twenty-four hours. No more.

30:33.609 --> 30:37.375
- Yes?
- I've bought you another 24 hours.

30:37.579 --> 30:39.877
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

30:40.082 --> 30:41.913
That should be
more than enough time.

30:42.518 --> 30:44.349
<i>Do you have a lead?</i>

30:44.553 --> 30:46.350
Better than a lead.

30:47.189 --> 30:48.178
A location.

31:26.762 --> 31:28.730
I'm hungry.

31:29.765 --> 31:32.256
We're 100 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

31:33.735 --> 31:36.135
I don't like sausage.

31:38.941 --> 31:40.875
What would you like?

31:45.047 --> 31:46.674
Veal.

31:46.882 --> 31:48.816
Roast, with carrots...

31:49.017 --> 31:50.416
...and beets.

31:52.020 --> 31:55.046
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

31:55.257 --> 31:56.519
Nothing to start?

32:00.095 --> 32:02.063
A salad.

32:02.698 --> 32:05.929
Greens tossed with balsamic.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.897
From Modena.

32:08.103 --> 32:09.502
Aged?

32:09.705 --> 32:11.673
Of course, aged.

32:14.710 --> 32:16.701
And for dessert?

32:17.980 --> 32:19.572
Sachertorte.

32:20.115 --> 32:22.606
With whipped cream or without?

32:23.986 --> 32:25.317
With.

32:26.121 --> 32:27.952
To drink?

32:29.891 --> 32:31.085
Wine.

32:31.293 --> 32:33.090
Tokaj, perhaps?

32:33.629 --> 32:34.687
Ice wine.

32:35.864 --> 32:37.661
Of course.

32:49.578 --> 32:52.376
- What are you doing?
- Seeing a man about some jewelry.

33:04.092 --> 33:05.616
He's gone off the reservation.

33:07.996 --> 33:11.295
Send someone to get him back on.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.867
Don't kill him.

33:40.629 --> 33:43.223
Frank. It's so good to see you,
<i>mein Freund.</i>

33:43.532 --> 33:45.830
Good to see you too, Otto.

33:46.201 --> 33:48.692
You didn't mention
you bring company.

33:49.237 --> 33:50.363
It's not really company.

33:50.906 --> 33:52.533
It's...

33:53.742 --> 33:54.834
...complicated.

33:55.043 --> 33:58.012
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

33:58.213 --> 34:01.944
...over a nice schnitzel
with <i>Kartoffelsalat</i> I have prepared.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.745
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

34:04.953 --> 34:07.387
...but we need to get rid of this first.

34:09.925 --> 34:13.382
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

34:13.895 --> 34:15.089
English, please, Otto.

34:16.565 --> 34:18.556
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

34:18.766 --> 34:21.860
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

34:22.070 --> 34:25.402
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

34:25.607 --> 34:28.235
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

34:28.443 --> 34:30.467
Very hush-hush stuff.

34:32.147 --> 34:35.047
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

34:35.250 --> 34:37.275
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

34:37.485 --> 34:39.647
...walking through the Internet.

34:39.855 --> 34:42.085
You wanna see the
invasion plans for Iran?

34:42.556 --> 34:44.286
Maybe some other time.

34:44.493 --> 34:47.929
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to Iran.

34:48.130 --> 34:50.563
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

34:50.766 --> 34:55.293
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

35:01.510 --> 35:02.977
You should not be doing this.

35:03.178 --> 35:05.169
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

35:05.380 --> 35:07.848
Not advice. A warning.

35:08.183 --> 35:10.174
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

35:17.025 --> 35:18.151
I agree with you.

35:22.798 --> 35:24.322
You're off course.

35:30.472 --> 35:33.066
- Should I?
- Yeah, you should.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.638
Look, fellas...

35:41.483 --> 35:44.384
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

35:45.821 --> 35:48.119
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

35:48.323 --> 35:51.520
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

35:53.695 --> 35:56.027
The boss says, "Back on the road."

35:56.531 --> 35:57.862
Frank?

35:58.667 --> 35:59.656
Keep at it.

36:02.437 --> 36:03.529
Back in the car, Frank.

36:04.239 --> 36:05.433
No.

37:16.845 --> 37:18.904
- Find it?
- Not yet.

38:35.657 --> 38:37.249
You're the smart one?

38:37.459 --> 38:40.053
No. I'm the big one.

39:32.247 --> 39:33.544
Not so big anymore, are you?

39:56.171 --> 39:57.968
Found it.

40:02.210 --> 40:04.701
- The transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

40:07.215 --> 40:08.204
It's wired.

40:08.750 --> 40:10.547
If I do:

41:08.510 --> 41:10.535
You fight good.

41:13.581 --> 41:15.674
But you tie bad.

41:21.322 --> 41:22.311
Where are you going?

41:22.857 --> 41:24.620
Tired.

41:25.827 --> 41:28.022
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

41:28.897 --> 41:30.558
That makes two of us.

41:31.099 --> 41:34.068
What do you want me to do
when they...? When they wake up?

41:34.269 --> 41:37.329
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

41:55.690 --> 41:56.816
I'm not amused.

41:57.025 --> 41:58.890
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

41:59.093 --> 42:01.493
<i>If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.</i>
<i>You need me.</i>

42:01.696 --> 42:04.494
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

42:06.134 --> 42:07.226
I'm listening.

42:07.702 --> 42:08.828
In person.

42:09.037 --> 42:10.470
We've already done in person.

42:10.672 --> 42:12.765
<i>Well, not to my satisfaction,</i>
<i>apparently.</i>

42:13.508 --> 42:16.409
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

42:17.512 --> 42:20.037
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

43:16.938 --> 43:17.996
Hello?

43:18.206 --> 43:20.140
You've disappointed me.

43:20.341 --> 43:23.401
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

43:23.611 --> 43:28.378
- I told you I wanted to do this in person.
- That won't be necessary. You see...

43:28.583 --> 43:30.642
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

43:30.852 --> 43:34.344
...l've been thinking I don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

43:34.555 --> 43:36.716
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

43:36.924 --> 43:39.950
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

43:40.161 --> 43:43.494
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

44:29.844 --> 44:30.868
Who are you?

44:31.279 --> 44:33.873
- Your new chauffeur.
- I want the old one back.

44:34.082 --> 44:36.414
He's about to go to pieces.

45:44.886 --> 45:46.217
You're fired.

45:50.057 --> 45:51.081
How was your nap?

45:51.459 --> 45:53.859
Restful. How was your phone call?

45:54.061 --> 45:56.529
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

46:08.443 --> 46:09.432
Tarconi.

46:09.644 --> 46:10.668
It's me.

46:11.846 --> 46:13.575
I was wondering
when you would call.

46:13.781 --> 46:14.975
I've been busy.

46:15.183 --> 46:17.811
Let me guess. In Budapest?

46:19.086 --> 46:20.417
You've been busy too.

46:20.922 --> 46:23.755
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.791
So I don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

46:26.994 --> 46:29.428
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

46:29.630 --> 46:31.689
<i>Probably not occupied</i>
<i>by friends of yours.</i>

46:31.899 --> 46:34.527
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

46:35.336 --> 46:38.669
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

46:38.873 --> 46:40.773
Russian, I think.

46:41.008 --> 46:43.169
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

46:43.377 --> 46:45.345
Have you tried asking her?

46:45.546 --> 46:47.605
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- <i>Sorry.</i>

46:47.815 --> 46:49.510
Of course you've asked.
And she says?

46:50.151 --> 46:51.448
I'm going to die.

46:51.652 --> 46:53.950
Typical. Russians.

46:54.155 --> 46:56.350
They are so dark.

46:56.557 --> 47:00.049
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

47:00.261 --> 47:02.923
...when do these people laugh?

47:03.130 --> 47:04.791
One page after the other...

47:04.999 --> 47:07.968
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

47:08.169 --> 47:11.570
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? I'm blinking here.

47:11.772 --> 47:12.966
Is that code?

47:13.908 --> 47:17.344
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

47:17.545 --> 47:19.775
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

47:19.981 --> 47:20.970
<i>They?</i>

47:21.682 --> 47:22.706
Some American.

47:22.950 --> 47:25.783
<i>Can you be more specific?</i>
<i>A name? A number?</i>

47:25.987 --> 47:27.011
Nothing.

47:27.221 --> 47:29.416
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

47:29.624 --> 47:31.319
It's my nature.

47:31.526 --> 47:33.357
<i>Where are you? I will come there.</i>

47:33.561 --> 47:36.029
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

47:36.230 --> 47:39.063
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

47:40.701 --> 47:42.828
How close are you to a computer?

47:46.674 --> 47:47.766
Yes, Frank?

47:47.975 --> 47:50.739
<i>That wasn't very nice,</i>
<i>back there in the market.</i>

47:50.945 --> 47:53.778
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

47:53.981 --> 47:56.040
<i>Point well taken.</i>

47:56.317 --> 47:59.844
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

48:00.054 --> 48:03.182
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

48:03.824 --> 48:04.882
<i>More or less.</i>

48:05.092 --> 48:07.993
You have what I need
to get the bracelet off...

48:08.195 --> 48:11.028
...I have the packages
you need delivered.

48:12.066 --> 48:14.591
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-12.

48:15.002 --> 48:16.469
<i>That'll take you to the place...</i>

48:16.671 --> 48:18.969
<i>... where we can have a
<i>conclusion to this business.</i></i>

48:19.173 --> 48:20.902
I look forward to it.

48:26.914 --> 48:28.211
Frank.

48:28.416 --> 48:29.610
<i>Did you get it?</i>

48:34.622 --> 48:36.556
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

48:36.757 --> 48:38.987
<i>... and we should have his number</i>
<i>and location.</i>

48:40.361 --> 48:42.090
Your new phone, sir.

48:47.969 --> 48:50.938
- Anything else?
- No.

48:54.442 --> 48:58.139
<i>Frank, do you know where</i>
<i>the signal is taking you?</i>

49:08.522 --> 49:12.652
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

49:12.860 --> 49:16.023
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

49:16.230 --> 49:18.790
Romanian wine, not so good.

49:20.401 --> 49:23.234
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

49:25.740 --> 49:29.005
You really should begin
to think more positive.

49:29.210 --> 49:31.576
I'm realist.

49:33.514 --> 49:36.176
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

49:36.384 --> 49:39.251
What means "doom and gloom"?

49:39.453 --> 49:42.388
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

49:42.590 --> 49:45.559
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

49:45.793 --> 49:49.058
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

49:49.263 --> 49:51.390
I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian.

49:52.099 --> 49:53.157
Excuse me.

49:53.367 --> 49:57.428
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

49:57.638 --> 49:58.798
...and here.

50:04.478 --> 50:08.471
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

50:10.051 --> 50:12.451
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

50:14.455 --> 50:16.787
Well, I see
you're putting makeup on.

50:16.991 --> 50:20.483
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

50:23.030 --> 50:26.466
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

50:33.240 --> 50:35.333
Hello.

50:36.343 --> 50:37.503
What's that?

50:37.712 --> 50:40.180
Souvenirs from Ibiza.
Do you want one?

50:40.481 --> 50:43.507
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

50:45.586 --> 50:47.281
Okay.

50:52.393 --> 50:53.883
You stay sharp.

50:54.095 --> 50:56.962
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

50:57.431 --> 51:00.798
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

51:04.105 --> 51:05.367
Give me that...

51:10.478 --> 51:12.605
Jesus.

51:15.082 --> 51:16.709
Great.

51:18.819 --> 51:22.084
- Just great.
- Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

51:22.289 --> 51:24.154
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

51:24.358 --> 51:26.986
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

51:27.194 --> 51:28.252
That would be nice.

51:28.829 --> 51:31.297
Boring. Boring. Boring?

51:31.499 --> 51:33.433
Oh, yeah.

52:11.705 --> 52:13.468
You should stay in the car.

52:13.808 --> 52:16.140
You want me to pee in car?

52:21.448 --> 52:23.609
Okay. Go on.

52:27.521 --> 52:28.886
You remember.

52:55.115 --> 52:56.912
Don't.

53:18.639 --> 53:19.663
Don't.

53:21.108 --> 53:22.097
<i>Don't.</i>

53:42.796 --> 53:43.785
Oh, no.

54:22.036 --> 54:25.494
- Stop, all right?
- Why? I don't drive.

54:25.940 --> 54:26.929
I want to have fun.

54:27.141 --> 54:30.474
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

54:30.811 --> 54:33.837
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

54:34.048 --> 54:37.245
- Drink with me, Frankie.
- I don't want a drink.

54:40.020 --> 54:42.511
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

54:42.723 --> 54:44.657
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

54:45.693 --> 54:47.820
Come on, get in the car.

54:48.929 --> 54:50.988
I am free, like a bird.

54:59.006 --> 55:00.769
The girl! Come on! Faster!

55:09.550 --> 55:12.144
- I have lost my friend!
- I'll buy you a new one.

55:26.533 --> 55:28.524
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

55:29.870 --> 55:31.235
I don't know. I don't care.

55:33.574 --> 55:35.974
- You mind?
- First you say I'm doom and gloom...

55:36.176 --> 55:39.009
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

56:28.729 --> 56:31.163
- Yes, Frank?
- I thought we had an agreement.

56:31.365 --> 56:32.593
We do.

56:32.833 --> 56:34.698
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

56:36.336 --> 56:40.773
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

56:40.974 --> 56:42.771
Likely.

56:45.546 --> 56:48.879
What I think is that there are
other forces at work here.

56:49.083 --> 56:51.483
Let me check into it,
see what I can find out.

56:51.685 --> 56:53.277
What do I do in the meantime?

56:53.487 --> 56:55.648
Drive faster.

57:30.124 --> 57:31.421
What the hell is he doing?

58:34.454 --> 58:36.217
There!

58:36.423 --> 58:37.822
He's down there!

58:43.397 --> 58:44.694
I'm hungry.

58:44.898 --> 58:47.059
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

58:49.336 --> 58:50.360
Look!

58:56.777 --> 58:58.904
I wasn't hungry then, I was thirsty.

58:59.112 --> 59:00.773
Why you are so mean to me?

59:02.115 --> 59:05.278
- I'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
- What means "preoccupied"?

59:10.958 --> 59:12.516
That means preoccupied.

59:24.271 --> 59:26.239
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

59:28.075 --> 59:30.635
- Get down!
- Shoot him!

59:41.355 --> 59:42.652
Bloody hell!

59:52.699 --> 59:53.927
Faster!

01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:02.001
Stop the car!

01:00:02.876 --> 01:00:04.104
Oh, shit!

01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:10.508
What are you doing?

01:01:10.744 --> 01:01:12.177
You're so tense.

01:01:12.579 --> 01:01:14.604
You don't say.

01:01:19.186 --> 01:01:20.847
I make you relax, okay?

01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:25.022
- Yeah.
- I'm good at this.

01:01:25.492 --> 01:01:27.722
Making tense go away.

01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:37.897
What are you doing?

01:01:38.105 --> 01:01:42.872
I want to feel sex
one more time before I die.

01:01:43.076 --> 01:01:44.543
Don't you?

01:01:46.813 --> 01:01:49.247
What is it with you and dying?

01:01:50.684 --> 01:01:53.346
There is something wrong with me?

01:01:53.954 --> 01:01:55.216
Am I not sexy?

01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:57.716
Yeah, you're sexy.

01:02:03.764 --> 01:02:04.753
You're the gay.

01:02:06.066 --> 01:02:09.297
Nope, I am not the gay.

01:02:09.503 --> 01:02:11.403
I don't mind.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.939
I'm not, okay?

01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:20.039
Then what's the problem?

01:02:22.182 --> 01:02:25.948
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:46.797
- I thought rule is don't open package.
- It is.

01:02:47.007 --> 01:02:48.702
Why you have rules
if you break them?

01:02:49.976 --> 01:02:51.671
I keep asking myself the same thing.

01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:55.137
Phone books.

01:03:03.557 --> 01:03:05.957
- You're the package.
- Yes.

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:08.358
Could have said something.

01:03:08.895 --> 01:03:11.489
- Would it make a difference?
- Yes.

01:03:13.567 --> 01:03:14.932
Now what are you doing?

01:03:15.135 --> 01:03:17.569
You know, back in garage...

01:03:17.771 --> 01:03:22.640
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

01:03:22.843 --> 01:03:25.505
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

01:03:25.712 --> 01:03:27.145
I don't see the turn-on in that.

01:03:27.347 --> 01:03:32.410
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

01:03:32.619 --> 01:03:34.644
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

01:03:34.855 --> 01:03:37.824
Would you striptease for me again?

01:03:38.525 --> 01:03:41.153
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:42.487
You want keys?

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:49.331
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:52.801
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

01:03:53.006 --> 01:03:55.497
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:59.770
Why do I get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:02.278
If I wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

01:04:02.482 --> 01:04:04.712
Now, give me the keys.

01:04:05.252 --> 01:04:07.584
Come on, Frank Martin.

01:04:07.787 --> 01:04:10.017
Make playtime for me.

01:04:30.076 --> 01:04:32.567
All right? That enough?

01:04:32.779 --> 01:04:35.543
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

01:04:35.749 --> 01:04:39.241
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

01:04:39.619 --> 01:04:41.610
Come on, Frank Martin.

01:04:41.922 --> 01:04:43.822
You want keys?

01:04:44.224 --> 01:04:47.022
I want strip.

01:04:53.233 --> 01:04:55.827
You know what I'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

01:04:56.036 --> 01:04:57.469
Spank me?

01:04:58.038 --> 01:04:59.266
For starters.

01:04:59.472 --> 01:05:02.066
- Tie me up?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:05:03.543 --> 01:05:06.137
I like the rough stuff.

01:05:09.516 --> 01:05:11.507
Really?

01:05:15.822 --> 01:05:18.586
Oh, but not too rough.

01:05:19.593 --> 01:05:21.959
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

01:05:22.162 --> 01:05:25.620
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

01:05:33.273 --> 01:05:34.672
Like you mean it.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.043
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

01:05:45.185 --> 01:05:47.551
I'm thinking maybe not.

01:05:47.754 --> 01:05:50.018
I'm thinking you live alone.

01:05:51.024 --> 01:05:52.958
Inside and outside.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.729
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:58.795
It's living.

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:00.589
Live with me.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.563
Just this once.

01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:06.227
Just this moment. Live with me.

01:06:48.548 --> 01:06:50.482
- What's his position?
- We lost him.

01:06:52.585 --> 01:06:56.544
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

01:06:56.756 --> 01:06:59.156
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

01:07:06.366 --> 01:07:07.458
Yes.

01:07:07.667 --> 01:07:09.931
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

01:07:10.136 --> 01:07:11.933
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:07:12.138 --> 01:07:15.471
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

01:07:15.675 --> 01:07:18.735
<i>One more move like that and you will</i>
<i>never see your daughter again.</i>

01:07:18.945 --> 01:07:20.344
I want to hear her voice.

01:07:20.547 --> 01:07:23.175
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

01:07:23.383 --> 01:07:25.783
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

01:07:25.985 --> 01:07:28.579
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

01:07:28.788 --> 01:07:31.416
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:34.288
<i>Yes, I know who you are.</i>

01:07:34.627 --> 01:07:37.687
And I can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

01:07:37.897 --> 01:07:39.762
...I will use all the power I have.

01:07:39.966 --> 01:07:45.404
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

01:07:48.808 --> 01:07:50.036
We have to move now.

01:07:56.216 --> 01:07:57.911
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

01:08:14.934 --> 01:08:17.595
I'm in Ibiza. Making holiday.

01:08:22.908 --> 01:08:25.173
<i>Someone hands me</i>
<i>glass of champagne.</i>

01:08:25.377 --> 01:08:27.175
<i>I drink.</i>

01:08:27.913 --> 01:08:30.381
<i>Then I don't feel so good.</i>

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:46.457
<i>I go to bathroom, and next thing,</i>
<i>I'm awake in the car.</i>

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:51.466
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.707
He's pretty good driver.

01:08:58.645 --> 01:09:00.805
Not like you good.

01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:07.716
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

01:09:07.921 --> 01:09:12.290
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:15.024
<i>He's afraid.</i>
<i>He's never done this before.</i>

01:09:15.828 --> 01:09:20.390
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.933
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

01:09:24.571 --> 01:09:26.300
But I convince him.

01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.835
<i>I call.</i>

01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:32.740
<i>But before I say to my father</i>
<i>where we are...</i>

01:09:32.946 --> 01:09:34.243
Inside the car. Come on!

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.581
<i>We get away, but...</i>

01:09:45.758 --> 01:09:48.386
There's people shooting at us. Why?

01:09:48.595 --> 01:09:50.756
Why they shooting at us?

01:09:50.964 --> 01:09:55.867
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

01:09:56.236 --> 01:10:00.696
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

01:10:00.907 --> 01:10:03.205
He says he has a friend.

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:14.416
And then I met you.

01:10:17.223 --> 01:10:19.885
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:26.727
You didn't even know me.

01:10:27.467 --> 01:10:28.866
Of course I don't know you.

01:10:29.068 --> 01:10:32.560
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

01:10:34.707 --> 01:10:39.041
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

01:10:39.812 --> 01:10:43.407
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

01:10:43.616 --> 01:10:45.083
No?

01:10:46.653 --> 01:10:48.143
No.

01:10:48.655 --> 01:10:51.954
Yes. Just a little.

01:11:18.384 --> 01:11:20.545
He's back on the radar, sir.

01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:27.491
- Yeah.
- Where the hell are you?

01:11:27.694 --> 01:11:28.888
On the way to Bucharest.

01:11:29.228 --> 01:11:30.627
Not any longer.

01:11:32.699 --> 01:11:36.294
New coordinates: 3-7-13.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.003
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:18.837
Sorry, just a minute.

01:12:19.045 --> 01:12:21.138
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

01:12:22.749 --> 01:12:25.013
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

01:12:25.218 --> 01:12:28.153
...but a small town to the east...
- What do you want, inspector?

01:12:28.354 --> 01:12:30.015
- A word with you.
- I have no time.

01:12:31.024 --> 01:12:32.491
It's about your daughter.

01:12:40.767 --> 01:12:44.362
Odessa, Frank. My country.

01:12:45.038 --> 01:12:48.132
You take me home. Thank you.

01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:52.109
What happened to Bucharest?

01:12:53.713 --> 01:12:58.548
- Change of plans.
- It's a good change. I prefer Odessa.

01:12:59.218 --> 01:13:00.810
Yeah.

01:13:01.754 --> 01:13:04.882
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:07.082
Oh, it's much better here.

01:13:07.293 --> 01:13:10.387
- You know chicken Kiev?
- I do.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:12.791
I know restaurant here.

01:13:12.999 --> 01:13:14.330
Best in the world.

01:13:14.534 --> 01:13:18.868
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out...

01:13:19.072 --> 01:13:21.199
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

01:13:26.913 --> 01:13:29.347
You know what I feel like now?

01:13:32.018 --> 01:13:33.679
Hungry.

01:13:36.823 --> 01:13:38.552
Safe.

01:13:46.199 --> 01:13:51.034
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

01:13:54.707 --> 01:13:57.335
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:01.803
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:05.448
Liar.

01:14:23.569 --> 01:14:25.662
<i>Mr. Minister, an update, please.</i>

01:14:27.373 --> 01:14:31.810
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

01:14:33.646 --> 01:14:36.513
Hello? Hello?

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.711
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

01:14:48.361 --> 01:14:50.522
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- We are closing the noose, Frank.

01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:54.463
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:56.191
You know what this is about yet?

01:14:57.436 --> 01:14:59.927
The girl. Her father.

01:15:00.273 --> 01:15:02.798
Large amounts of toxic waste.

01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:05.341
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

01:15:07.079 --> 01:15:10.139
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

01:15:10.349 --> 01:15:13.580
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:17.244
Am I detecting a little attachment?

01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:23.024
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:25.424
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

01:15:26.132 --> 01:15:31.729
Frank, I always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

01:15:33.706 --> 01:15:34.695
Anything else?

01:15:35.908 --> 01:15:37.569
<i>Where is the rendezvous?</i>

01:15:37.777 --> 01:15:39.711
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:47.078
- Yeah.
- We're almost at the end, Frank.

01:15:47.286 --> 01:15:49.846
- <i>Just give me the coordinates.</i>
- No more coordinates.

01:15:50.556 --> 01:15:52.547
The road you're on.

01:15:52.892 --> 01:15:54.223
Make your first left.

01:15:55.027 --> 01:15:56.517
I'd like to know where I'm going.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.768
You'll know when you get there.

01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:36.063
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

01:16:43.009 --> 01:16:44.977
My compliments, Frank.

01:16:45.177 --> 01:16:48.806
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

01:16:49.382 --> 01:16:51.145
<i>If you could please</i>
<i>send the girl out.</i>

01:16:52.852 --> 01:16:54.342
She's coming.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.813
I'm not coming.

01:16:57.523 --> 01:16:59.650
They need you. They won't kill you.

01:16:59.859 --> 01:17:02.191
But they will kill you.

01:17:02.695 --> 01:17:05.960
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.189
Do I?

01:17:18.477 --> 01:17:20.945
We don't have all day, Frank.

01:17:24.784 --> 01:17:26.342
Look how many of them.

01:17:26.552 --> 01:17:28.486
They have all the guns.

01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:29.848
How it's gonna be okay?

01:17:34.026 --> 01:17:35.323
Tell you over dinner.

01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:38.190
Now, go.

01:17:39.165 --> 01:17:40.393
Go.

01:17:40.599 --> 01:17:42.328
Kiss me.

01:17:59.218 --> 01:18:00.708
Go.

01:18:05.591 --> 01:18:08.151
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

01:18:32.852 --> 01:18:35.047
Get to her, you bastard.

01:19:00.413 --> 01:19:02.472
Better now, darling?

01:19:20.933 --> 01:19:22.423
Finish him.

01:19:41.954 --> 01:19:44.252
No! Frank!

01:19:55.534 --> 01:19:58.025
His beloved car will be his grave.

01:19:58.237 --> 01:20:01.104
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

01:20:12.351 --> 01:20:14.342
- Tarconi.
- They have the girl.

01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:19.057
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

01:20:19.258 --> 01:20:21.488
- Where are you?
- In a lake.

01:20:22.728 --> 01:20:24.355
A lake?

01:20:24.864 --> 01:20:26.729
Can you be more specific?

01:20:26.932 --> 01:20:28.194
There's a dam.

01:20:29.869 --> 01:20:31.803
- A dam?
- I know the place, sir.

01:20:32.004 --> 01:20:33.801
- How far?
- Ten minutes at least.

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.870
Frank, we'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:20:36.075 --> 01:20:37.372
Can you make it any faster?

01:20:37.843 --> 01:20:40.141
- We'll do our best.
- Thank you.

01:22:38.597 --> 01:22:40.087
Buy tickets for all of us.

01:22:40.699 --> 01:22:42.098
Where to?

01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:46.237
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

01:22:46.438 --> 01:22:48.372
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

01:22:54.013 --> 01:22:55.412
Another day.

01:23:09.928 --> 01:23:12.419
Sir! There!

01:23:29.648 --> 01:23:33.778
- Out. Out!
- Everybody out!

01:23:34.019 --> 01:23:35.418
- Come on.
- Move!

01:23:36.188 --> 01:23:37.712
Move, quick!

01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:57.369
- Mr. Minister?
- Yes.

01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:59.705
Someone wants to talk to you.

01:24:01.046 --> 01:24:03.708
- Papa.
- Are you all right?

01:24:08.287 --> 01:24:09.948
Don't sign.

01:24:10.656 --> 01:24:13.716
What you have is 15 minutes.

01:24:20.999 --> 01:24:23.695
- You ever find out what this is about?
- Garbage.

01:24:23.902 --> 01:24:25.426
How much garbage are we talking?

01:24:26.371 --> 01:24:29.932
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

01:24:30.142 --> 01:24:31.131
Try it again.

01:24:51.864 --> 01:24:55.197
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:57.128
This is the new world.

01:24:58.303 --> 01:25:00.567
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

01:25:01.006 --> 01:25:04.373
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

01:25:04.576 --> 01:25:07.306
Efficiency and waste.

01:25:07.513 --> 01:25:09.504
Think global, not local.

01:25:10.315 --> 01:25:12.249
Think this.

01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:29.033
- Yes?
- Where are we?

01:25:36.642 --> 01:25:38.132
We're almost there.

01:25:40.779 --> 01:25:42.144
Where?

01:25:42.347 --> 01:25:44.372
Here. He is on a train.

01:25:45.017 --> 01:25:47.349
- And where are we?
- Here.

01:25:47.553 --> 01:25:49.748
We can get units there.

01:25:51.423 --> 01:25:53.220
That's a good idea. Do that.

01:25:57.196 --> 01:26:00.029
Oh, Frank, come on.

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:34.490
Mr. Minister, I assure you,
everything is in order.

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.565
I'm sure it is.

01:26:37.002 --> 01:26:40.836
- If there are any problems...
- I know you will solve them.

01:26:41.773 --> 01:26:43.673
Now, if you don't mind...

01:27:14.072 --> 01:27:17.599
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

01:27:18.877 --> 01:27:20.936
I hate violence.

01:27:22.948 --> 01:27:25.746
It creates more problems
than it solves.

01:27:27.386 --> 01:27:30.219
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

01:27:31.723 --> 01:27:34.783
A client asked me to obtain a result...

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:37.353
...so I went about creating
an environment...

01:27:37.562 --> 01:27:39.325
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

01:27:39.531 --> 01:27:42.261
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

01:27:42.467 --> 01:27:46.233
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

01:27:47.372 --> 01:27:49.932
Everyone wanted to fight.

01:28:05.324 --> 01:28:06.518
What's so funny?

01:28:07.759 --> 01:28:10.250
Hearing a dead man talking.

01:30:23.128 --> 01:30:25.062
One more step, Frank.

01:30:25.497 --> 01:30:27.021
Come on. One more.

01:31:10.642 --> 01:31:12.075
Look.

01:31:12.444 --> 01:31:13.468
It's over.

01:31:14.379 --> 01:31:16.040
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

01:31:19.851 --> 01:31:21.944
Oh, my God.

01:31:27.225 --> 01:31:28.658
No, Frank. No, no.

01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:12.102
It's over, Frank. It's over.

01:32:13.371 --> 01:32:15.839
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

01:32:17.442 --> 01:32:19.774
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

01:32:19.978 --> 01:32:21.639
...l'd like to offer you a position.

01:32:21.846 --> 01:32:25.145
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

01:32:44.436 --> 01:32:45.767
I hate to waste talent.

01:32:45.971 --> 01:32:48.269
But I really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

01:32:48.473 --> 01:32:49.963
That's right.

01:33:13.765 --> 01:33:14.857
No!

01:33:18.803 --> 01:33:21.966
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

01:33:26.544 --> 01:33:27.806
No, no.

01:33:39.124 --> 01:33:40.148
No!

01:33:41.793 --> 01:33:43.021
No!

01:33:58.743 --> 01:34:00.608
You're doing the right thing.

01:34:20.465 --> 01:34:22.194
Valentina.

01:34:27.339 --> 01:34:28.567
Valentina.

01:34:38.883 --> 01:34:41.010
Am I in heaven?

01:34:44.155 --> 01:34:46.419
Looks more like we're in hell.

01:34:46.925 --> 01:34:48.722
I don't care.

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:50.721
As long as we're there together.

01:35:03.074 --> 01:35:04.132
Yes?

01:35:04.342 --> 01:35:07.505
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

01:35:09.013 --> 01:35:10.605
Thank you.

01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:27.530
- What are you doing?
- What you said, the right thing.

01:35:27.732 --> 01:35:30.963
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

01:35:31.169 --> 01:35:34.104
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

01:35:34.305 --> 01:35:35.294
Thank you very much.

01:35:54.492 --> 01:35:55.516
Is the launch ready?

01:35:55.727 --> 01:35:58.059
- It's on the water, sir, waiting.
- Time to leave.

01:35:58.797 --> 01:36:00.128
- Grab the log.
- Okay.

01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:22.117
I just don't understand it.

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.288
When I was a boy, my father and I...

01:36:24.489 --> 01:36:27.822
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

01:36:28.026 --> 01:36:29.653
Times change, inspector.

01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:31.990
As do people.

01:36:34.999 --> 01:36:36.933
You referring to me?

01:36:38.503 --> 01:36:40.596
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

01:36:41.539 --> 01:36:43.769
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

01:36:43.975 --> 01:36:48.105
Oh, I was not referring
to your car or your house.

01:36:50.982 --> 01:36:53.348
The sea is so restful.

01:36:53.551 --> 01:36:54.711
Is lunch ready yet?

01:36:55.987 --> 01:36:59.286
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

01:36:59.491 --> 01:37:02.824
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

01:37:03.027 --> 01:37:05.257
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

01:37:05.463 --> 01:37:06.794
...we're gonna catch nothing.

01:37:06.998 --> 01:37:10.729
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

01:37:10.935 --> 01:37:12.869
...and go right to eating of lunch?

01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:16.234
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

01:37:16.441 --> 01:37:19.342
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

01:37:19.544 --> 01:37:25.312
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

01:37:26.017 --> 01:37:27.917
What kind of wine?

01:37:28.119 --> 01:37:29.848
Pink. From south.

01:37:31.155 --> 01:37:32.986
A Châteauneuf, perhaps.

01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:35.892
- Chilled.
- Of course, chilled.

01:37:36.094 --> 01:37:38.028
And for dessert?
