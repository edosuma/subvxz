00:00.992 --> 00:03.078
<i>Friday dinner out is a tradition</i>

00:03.156 --> 00:04.489
<i>my parents never believed in.</i>

00:04.557 --> 00:06.708
<i>But Shannon's finally
getting confirmed on Sunday,</i>

00:06.793 --> 00:08.960
<i>which means my mom has
set the dining-room table</i>

00:09.062 --> 00:10.361
<i>and the kitchen is off-limits.</i>

00:10.463 --> 00:11.762
Now, I know I told you

00:11.864 --> 00:13.631
that your Confirmation
could be on your terms,

00:13.700 --> 00:15.733
but I have decided that
your wardrobe is still up to me.

00:15.802 --> 00:18.536
Please don't make me wear some
little-girl dress that I hate.

00:18.604 --> 00:20.004
Oh, but it's adorable!

00:20.073 --> 00:21.806
And I got matching pocket
squares for your brothers.

00:21.908 --> 00:23.274
Mm, I'm gonna need to see swatches,

00:23.376 --> 00:24.408
but you have my attention.

00:24.510 --> 00:25.910
I would like to dress myself.

00:25.979 --> 00:26.978
Really?

00:27.080 --> 00:28.479
Actually, no, I trust you.

00:28.548 --> 00:30.247
I just want us all to look perfect...

00:30.316 --> 00:33.951
all of us sitting there
as a family in the front pew.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.753
That is the last thing
I ask of you people.

00:35.822 --> 00:37.054
Okay, if you promise I have

00:37.123 --> 00:38.789
total control over everything else.

00:38.891 --> 00:40.725
Okay, fine. Yes. I promise.

00:40.827 --> 00:43.127
Great, because I fired
Uncle Brendan as my godfather.

00:43.229 --> 00:44.195
What?

00:44.263 --> 00:45.930
But he's your Confirmation sponsor.

00:46.032 --> 00:47.098
He's also a dud.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.367
Hey. My brother's not a dud.

00:49.435 --> 00:51.229
- He lives off the grid.
- In a yurt.

00:51.393 --> 00:52.703
His best friend is a wolf.

00:52.805 --> 00:54.071
Okay, he's a dud.

00:54.173 --> 00:56.607
But I was arguing <i>for</i> him.

00:56.776 --> 00:58.976
I just don't feel comfortable
saddling Aunt Jodi

00:59.045 --> 01:00.845
with a godpartner
who's so far beneath her...

01:00.913 --> 01:02.346
or me, so I fired him.

01:02.415 --> 01:04.081
You can't fire a godparent.

01:04.183 --> 01:05.282
That's true.

01:05.351 --> 01:08.819
He received his emotional severance
in Bitcoin, as requested.

01:08.921 --> 01:11.355
Besides, I already have someone
in mind to take his place.

01:11.424 --> 01:13.791
Okay. Honey, we've talked about this.

01:13.893 --> 01:16.393
Alan Greenspan is not gonna
answer your e-mails.

01:16.462 --> 01:18.429
That is the hottest woman
I've ever seen.

01:19.499 --> 01:20.898
Oh, my God! That's not a woman!

01:20.967 --> 01:22.466
- That's our old babysitter!
- Yeah, it's Heather!

01:22.502 --> 01:23.901
- Oh!
- Hey!

01:24.003 --> 01:25.736
Oh, hi, Heather. Nice to see you.

01:25.838 --> 01:27.571
Yeah. When...
When'd you get back into town?

01:27.640 --> 01:30.074
Last week. Finally finished my PhD.

01:30.176 --> 01:31.175
- Oh!
- Congrats.

01:31.244 --> 01:32.943
Thanks. Hey, Jimmy.

01:33.012 --> 01:35.412
It's "James," now. Has been for a while.

01:35.481 --> 01:38.015
This pizza is tre formaggi.

01:38.117 --> 01:39.717
- Care for a slice?
- Careful. It's hot.

01:39.819 --> 01:41.619
Ohh! Ow! Balls on fire!

01:41.721 --> 01:42.620
Balls on fire!

01:42.722 --> 01:45.689

01:49.729 --> 01:51.262
Mm.

01:51.364 --> 01:53.464
Do you plan on putting the food
out a day early, too?

01:53.566 --> 01:55.733
Mm, I thought about it,
but this isn't France,

01:55.835 --> 01:57.568
so the eggs stay in the fridge
where they belong.

01:57.637 --> 01:58.869
Okay. I have an idea

01:58.971 --> 02:00.738
that would make Shannon's
Confirmation even better.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.940
Is it those top hats
that say "Confirmaniac"?

02:03.042 --> 02:04.041
'Cause the party store ran out.

02:04.143 --> 02:05.409
- No.
- Oh.

02:05.478 --> 02:07.678
Brett as my date
to Shannon's Confirmation.

02:07.780 --> 02:08.779
Not happening.

02:08.881 --> 02:10.114
Let me guess... You still can't handle

02:10.216 --> 02:11.415
the fact that I have a boyfriend.

02:11.517 --> 02:12.616
That's not what this is about.

02:12.718 --> 02:14.785
This is about Brett not
belonging in the front pew.

02:14.887 --> 02:16.153
That's for family.

02:16.255 --> 02:18.255
Aunt Jodi always gets to bring
a date to these things.

02:18.357 --> 02:19.523
Not this time.

02:19.625 --> 02:22.860
Need I remind you of the fortune
in photoshopping it cost

02:22.962 --> 02:25.095
to replace all of her bad dates
with a Ficus

02:25.198 --> 02:26.897
in past Confirmation photos?

02:26.999 --> 02:29.166
Okay. What about VP Murray?
Aren't you bringing him?

02:29.268 --> 02:30.434
No, I'm not.

02:30.536 --> 02:32.503
You know, we're seeing
each other, and that's nice,

02:32.605 --> 02:34.638
but he doesn't belong
in the family pew yet.

02:34.740 --> 02:35.906
Things are a lot more complicated

02:36.008 --> 02:37.908
than they were when
you got confirmed, okay,

02:38.010 --> 02:39.777
and your sister's already
given me enough of a hard time,

02:39.879 --> 02:41.545
so this conversation's over.

02:43.149 --> 02:44.682
I'll tell you what's over...

02:44.784 --> 02:47.384
symmetry of this table.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.188
No.

02:53.259 --> 02:54.992
I know the last time you saw me

02:55.094 --> 02:56.827
I was 12 and 2 months and 4 days,

02:56.929 --> 02:59.797
but I shave now... everywhere.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.499
So, you built all this?

03:02.602 --> 03:05.669
Sure did. Okay. Wait for it...

03:09.008 --> 03:11.342
And voilà!

03:11.444 --> 03:12.910
It's pretty cool, right?

03:12.979 --> 03:15.179
I knew some guys at Northwestern
that would have loved this.

03:15.281 --> 03:16.480
- Northwestern?
- Yeah.

03:16.582 --> 03:17.781
That's cool. I party there.

03:17.883 --> 03:18.949
- You do?
- Yeah.

03:19.051 --> 03:21.218
- That's very mature of you.
- I'm very mature.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.553
Other mature things I do

03:22.655 --> 03:25.189
are not chase the pigeons in the park

03:25.291 --> 03:28.325
and correctly pronounce the word
"Acetaminophen."

03:28.427 --> 03:31.195
Oh, and I... I win a boatload
of wrestling trophies.

03:31.297 --> 03:32.696
- You want to see them?
- Sure.

03:32.798 --> 03:34.465
- Okay, I'll be right back!
- Okay.

03:35.501 --> 03:36.634
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Jimmy.

03:36.736 --> 03:38.235
- Oh. Hey!
- Oh, hi.

03:38.337 --> 03:39.870
Jimmy was just showing me around.

03:39.972 --> 03:42.072
Oh. Sure is nice of him.

03:42.174 --> 03:43.274
Yeah.

03:43.376 --> 03:44.908
Seems like just yesterday
I was stopping him

03:45.011 --> 03:46.777
from bringing a hair dryer
into the bathtub.

03:46.879 --> 03:49.113
Well, for me it was just yesterday.

03:49.181 --> 03:51.582
It's really cool that you let him
build this place for himself.

03:51.684 --> 03:54.118
Oh, this is, uh, actually my place.

03:54.220 --> 03:55.853
Eileen and I got a divorce,

03:55.955 --> 03:57.554
so I live here now.

03:57.657 --> 03:59.390
I'm sorry. I-I-I didn't know.

03:59.492 --> 04:00.958
We are very much divorced.

04:01.027 --> 04:03.193
Yeah. Eileen's actually already
in a relationshi...

04:03.296 --> 04:04.895
Mm.

04:06.065 --> 04:07.164
What was that for?

04:07.266 --> 04:09.933
For the crush I've had since I was 17.

04:10.002 --> 04:12.636
Spoiler alert... I'm not 17 anymore.

04:16.075 --> 04:18.274
Jimmy. Oh, no.

04:18.377 --> 04:20.543
And no.

04:20.646 --> 04:23.647
So, Party Vault also didn't have
the top hats you wanted,

04:23.749 --> 04:26.750
but they did have this.

04:26.819 --> 04:29.753
Oh, Clive. A Jesus piñata?

04:29.855 --> 04:31.455
Don't you think the poor man's
been through enough?

04:31.557 --> 04:32.756
Well, you don't have to hit him.

04:32.858 --> 04:34.325
You just twist the sandal
and the candy falls out.

04:34.427 --> 04:35.826
Vice Principal Murray...

04:35.895 --> 04:38.195
Just the man I wanted to see
in my kitchen.

04:38.297 --> 04:39.663
I have a question for you.

04:39.765 --> 04:41.865
Well, if it has to do with
"Star Wars" or bird calls,

04:41.967 --> 04:43.000
I'm your man.

04:43.069 --> 04:44.568
Well, actually, only
North American bird calls.

04:44.670 --> 04:45.836
I-I get a little confused...

04:45.938 --> 04:47.471
Would you be willing
to be my new godfather?

04:47.573 --> 04:49.039
- What?!
- Wow!

04:49.141 --> 04:50.808
Wow, wow, wowzers. So many emotions.

04:50.876 --> 04:53.210
Um, I'm honored. I'm touched.

04:53.312 --> 04:55.045
I'm a little dry-mouthed
for some reason.

04:55.147 --> 04:57.514
Uh, but I guess it
depends on what your mom thinks.

04:57.616 --> 05:00.384
Your mom thinks she'd like to
have a word with her daughter

05:00.486 --> 05:01.652
in the other room.

05:04.724 --> 05:07.858
Clive cannot be your godfather.

05:07.927 --> 05:10.027
Okay, well,
I swear on the hidden cameras

05:10.129 --> 05:11.895
that may or may not be
recording this conversation

05:11.997 --> 05:13.030
that my motives are pure.

05:13.132 --> 05:14.832
So, you're saying you're okay

05:14.867 --> 05:17.167
with Clive being in your life forever.

05:17.269 --> 05:18.502
Yes, I am.

05:18.604 --> 05:19.970
But it seems like you're not.

05:20.072 --> 05:22.172
Okay, I am not prepared to be
making this decision right now,

05:22.308 --> 05:23.207
and I'm not gonna have

05:23.275 --> 05:25.042
some stupid Confirmation force my hand.

05:25.111 --> 05:27.444
And by "stupid",
I mean "big and meaningful."

05:27.513 --> 05:28.679
So sorry to rush you.

05:28.748 --> 05:31.382
I actually left my car on,
uh, not sure why.

05:31.484 --> 05:32.716
So, am I in?

05:32.785 --> 05:34.485
Yeah, Mom. Are you on board with

05:34.553 --> 05:36.754
your long-term boyfriend,
my vice principal,

05:36.822 --> 05:38.922
taking on such an important role
in my life?

05:39.024 --> 05:41.058
Wow. When you put it that way,

05:41.127 --> 05:43.160
I can't not not say no.

05:43.262 --> 05:45.062
I'm hearing a lot of double negatives,

05:45.164 --> 05:46.296
and I'm not sure what's going on.

05:46.399 --> 05:47.931
- You're in.
- Wow!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.767
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go try

05:49.835 --> 05:52.202
and return a blasphemous piñata
to Party Vault.

05:52.271 --> 05:56.206
I'll stop by your office later
to work out the logistics.

05:56.275 --> 05:57.608
Thank you for taking this chance.

05:57.643 --> 05:59.676
I can almost promise you,
I will let you down.

05:59.745 --> 06:01.745
She just doesn't want
the whole congregation

06:01.847 --> 06:02.980
seeing that we're dating.

06:03.082 --> 06:05.249
She cares more about appearances
than her own son.

06:05.284 --> 06:07.785
Come on. The gay thing can be
really hard for some parents.

06:07.887 --> 06:10.187
Not yours. I mean,
they're members of PFLAG.

06:10.289 --> 06:12.523
They have a rainbow banner
outside their house.

06:12.591 --> 06:15.392
My mom adjusted
the parental controls on our TV

06:15.494 --> 06:16.794
to block musicals.

06:16.896 --> 06:18.195
I think you're being a little unfair.

06:18.297 --> 06:19.663
She's unfair.

06:19.732 --> 06:21.565
I mean, you're an important
part of my life now,

06:21.667 --> 06:23.167
and she needs to accept that.

06:23.269 --> 06:24.635
And that's exactly what I told her

06:24.737 --> 06:26.036
in a very strongly worded e-mail

06:26.105 --> 06:27.371
that's currently in my drafts folder.

06:27.473 --> 06:28.705
Aww.

06:28.808 --> 06:30.240
You were standing up for me?

06:30.342 --> 06:31.675
That's really sweet.

06:31.777 --> 06:33.444
I love you, Kenny O'Neal.

06:33.546 --> 06:36.380
<i>What did he just say?</i>

06:38.217 --> 06:39.249
Got to go. See ya.

06:39.351 --> 06:41.585
What?

06:41.687 --> 06:42.786
"Got to go"?

06:42.888 --> 06:45.122
Who says "I love you"
and then "Got to go"?

06:45.224 --> 06:46.390
My father.

06:46.492 --> 06:47.491
Oh.

06:52.221 --> 06:54.101
Brett said, "I love you."

06:54.137 --> 06:56.070
Heather was about to say, "I love you,"

06:56.139 --> 06:58.439
and now she's just gonna be saying,
"I love being your stepmom."

06:58.508 --> 07:01.008
But it's too soon.
It's too soon for "I love you."

07:01.044 --> 07:03.144
I mean, I really like Brett,

07:03.246 --> 07:05.379
but I don't know if I love him yet.

07:05.448 --> 07:07.415
And love leads to commitment,

07:07.517 --> 07:08.916
and commitment leads to marriage,

07:08.952 --> 07:11.118
and marriage leads to
living with one man

07:11.220 --> 07:14.021
for the rest of your life,
which leads to...

07:14.123 --> 07:15.256
Oh, God.

07:15.358 --> 07:16.891
Am I settling?

07:16.960 --> 07:19.760
This program just gets better and better.

07:19.862 --> 07:21.963
Keep your track suit on.
It's "Blue Bloods."

07:22.065 --> 07:23.164
Again.

07:23.266 --> 07:24.999
Yes, but it's Bogart's favorite.

07:25.034 --> 07:26.901
Oh. Bread basket?

07:26.970 --> 07:28.569
We can be fat now that we're in love.

07:28.671 --> 07:30.271
You keep saying that.

07:31.441 --> 07:33.474
Excuse me.

07:35.712 --> 07:36.577
Hey, Kenny.

07:36.679 --> 07:37.979
Jordin Sparks?

07:38.047 --> 07:39.313
Jordin Sparks is at my house!

07:39.382 --> 07:41.315
- How did you get here?
- In a jet.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.250
Okay, so I am throwing this party,

07:43.319 --> 07:45.219
and I thought it would be,
you know, really cool

07:45.288 --> 07:46.754
to invite some cool young people to it,

07:46.823 --> 07:48.129
but, I mean, I can see you're old

07:48.191 --> 07:51.258
and in a very committed
relationship, so...

07:51.327 --> 07:53.828
So I'm gonna sing my karaoke
duets with somebody else.

07:53.896 --> 07:54.862
What? No, no, no.

07:54.964 --> 07:56.730
Jordin Sparks, I have a beautiful voice.

07:56.799 --> 07:58.999
Ohh. I mean, I think
at some point in your life,

07:59.102 --> 08:00.167
but not anymore.

08:00.236 --> 08:02.770
But if I'm so old,
how are you still so young?

08:02.839 --> 08:04.071
It's 2019.

08:04.140 --> 08:05.973
It's only been two years
since Brett said, "I love you."

08:06.075 --> 08:07.074
Two years?

08:07.143 --> 08:09.243
I look like this after two years?

08:09.345 --> 08:10.411
That's what love does.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.213
It takes your hair and your joy.

08:12.315 --> 08:13.881
My precious bangs!

08:13.983 --> 08:16.717
Noooooooo!

08:16.786 --> 08:18.652
Oh, thank God.

08:18.754 --> 08:19.787
This looks horrible.

08:19.889 --> 08:21.088
Why don't they make invisible tape?

08:21.190 --> 08:22.423
They do. It's called glue.

08:22.525 --> 08:23.457
Hm.

08:23.559 --> 08:25.226
Oh, no. It's Brett.

08:25.328 --> 08:27.528
Hmm. What do I do?

08:27.597 --> 08:29.163
You just answer it.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.899
I can't! There's something wrong
with my phone!

08:33.635 --> 08:36.770
You are terrifying
when you're in a relationship.

08:36.873 --> 08:38.304
- So...
- Aah!

08:38.407 --> 08:39.807
...here's why I called you
to your office.

08:39.909 --> 08:41.909
You've reconsidered. You don't
want me to be your godfather.

08:41.977 --> 08:42.909
That's a wise choice.

08:42.979 --> 08:44.211
No, you're still in. Sit.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.412
Hmm.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.114
Here's the deal...

08:47.216 --> 08:48.983
Everyone getting confirmed
has to write an essay

08:49.051 --> 08:50.217
about their spiritual journey,

08:50.286 --> 08:52.686
but Father Phil refuses to approve mine.

08:52.755 --> 08:54.655
Too many cuss words? Did you go blue?

08:54.690 --> 08:56.457
No. I refer to God as female.

08:56.559 --> 08:59.059
I always had a hard time
relating to a higher power

08:59.162 --> 09:01.162
until I realized "He" can be a "She."

09:01.230 --> 09:02.363
And I wanted other people to know

09:02.465 --> 09:04.198
they could see God
however they want, too,

09:04.300 --> 09:06.400
but Father Phil
doesn't think that's kosher,

09:06.435 --> 09:09.403
and he won't confirm me unless
I change every "She" to a "He."

09:09.472 --> 09:10.604
So, you need to borrow some Wite-Out?

09:10.706 --> 09:11.839
Because I have many shades.

09:11.941 --> 09:14.275
No. I'm not changing anything.

09:14.343 --> 09:16.844
This is my Confirmation, and it
has to mean something to me.

09:16.946 --> 09:19.380
That is why I need you...

09:20.750 --> 09:22.349
...to talk to Father Phil.

09:22.418 --> 09:23.617
Me?

09:23.686 --> 09:24.818
You have pull with him, right?

09:24.887 --> 09:26.086
Push. Pull.

09:26.155 --> 09:27.288
I mean, who's to say what we have.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.223
Words cannot really describe
our relationship.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.958
Then go talk to him and change his mind.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.793
You can do it.

09:32.862 --> 09:35.429
I believe in you, Godfather.

09:35.498 --> 09:37.464
Don't be a Fredo.

09:39.902 --> 09:42.102
What happens to Fredo?

09:47.109 --> 09:48.576
Hey, Jimmy.

09:48.644 --> 09:50.477
Can we talk, please?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.079
I was just taking the garbage out.

09:52.181 --> 09:53.714
Unless you wanted to
steal that from me, too.

09:53.783 --> 09:55.049
Well, I do, but only because

09:55.117 --> 09:57.184
it's leaking all over your sneakers.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.385
Come on!

09:58.487 --> 09:59.453
Here.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.924
Look, son, I obviously did not mean

10:04.026 --> 10:05.759
to get in the way of your little crush.

10:05.828 --> 10:07.761
It wasn't a little crush, Dad.

10:07.863 --> 10:09.797
I was about to get Heather
in the back seat of my car,

10:09.899 --> 10:11.198
in her bra.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.167
She's too old for you.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.836
And she's too young for me,
so let's just move on.

10:15.905 --> 10:17.605
I can't do that, Dad.

10:17.707 --> 10:19.373
She was my first crush,

10:19.442 --> 10:20.941
and I always imagined
that when I was old enough

10:21.043 --> 10:22.509
that we would run into
each other on the street

10:22.612 --> 10:24.945
and we would go and see
"Titanic 3" together.

10:25.047 --> 10:28.082
And then we would discuss how
much we loved it over espresso.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.750
But now that's never gonna happen.

10:29.785 --> 10:31.352
Our love has less
of a chance of surviving

10:31.387 --> 10:34.255
than... than... than
the robots aboard "Titanic 3."

10:36.058 --> 10:39.260
They're never gonna make "Titanic 3."

10:41.764 --> 10:42.796
- So?
- Aah!

10:42.898 --> 10:44.064
What did Father Phil say?

10:44.166 --> 10:46.066
Uh, well, full disclosure...

10:46.135 --> 10:47.401
The reason I'm in his office so much

10:47.436 --> 10:49.403
is because he keeps
butterscotches on his desk.

10:49.505 --> 10:51.472
I mean, the bowl is always full.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.940
But I explained your predicament to him,

10:53.042 --> 10:55.209
and I have some very good news.

10:55.278 --> 10:56.343
I can get confirmed?

10:56.445 --> 10:58.679
Yep. Yes, sirree. 100%.

10:58.748 --> 11:01.582
I mean, your essay won't
get printed in the program,

11:01.651 --> 11:03.550
uh, but you're totally
gonna get confirmed.

11:03.653 --> 11:05.753
What? That sucks.

11:05.821 --> 11:07.755
Everyone else's stupid essays
aren't about anything

11:07.857 --> 11:10.257
while mine is actually about something.

11:10.359 --> 11:11.859
It means a lot to me.

11:11.894 --> 11:13.193
You want to rehire your wolf uncle?

11:13.296 --> 11:14.595
I can help you find him.

11:14.697 --> 11:17.231
I have access to the dark web,
and I can speak to eagles.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.400
I appreciate you coming back, Heather.

11:19.502 --> 11:22.269
I know this may sound like
a weird request...

11:22.338 --> 11:24.571
I like weird. I am all about the weird.

11:24.674 --> 11:28.008
Okay, listen, I am very
flattered by your attention.

11:28.077 --> 11:29.743
- Oh.
- But the reason I asked you here

11:29.812 --> 11:31.211
was to see if there is any chance

11:31.314 --> 11:32.846
that you would go
and grab a coffee with Jimmy.

11:32.915 --> 11:34.915
It would really mean a lot to him.

11:34.984 --> 11:38.018
And if a robot-boat movie
comes up, just go with it.

11:38.054 --> 11:39.286
Would it mean a lot to you?

11:39.322 --> 11:40.487
Yes. It would.

11:40.589 --> 11:42.623
J-Jimmy's just such a sensitive boy,

11:42.692 --> 11:43.657
- and it's my job...
- Aww.

11:43.759 --> 11:45.159
Well, I've decided to forgive you.

11:45.227 --> 11:46.293
What? Again?

11:46.362 --> 11:48.762
No. Jimmy, it is not what it looks like!

11:48.831 --> 11:49.797
Not yet it's not.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.999
You need to leave. Go.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.434
I'm calling your mother.

12:01.410 --> 12:02.876
Kenny.

12:05.915 --> 12:07.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.149
Sorry. I went and
answered the back door.

12:09.218 --> 12:11.118
Sometimes I don't know
where sound's coming from.

12:11.220 --> 12:12.186
I've been calling you.

12:12.254 --> 12:14.154
You have? Yeah. Sorry.

12:14.256 --> 12:16.690
I've been helping my mom
with my sister's Confirmation.

12:16.759 --> 12:19.226
So far we've confirmed that we
can't do a thing with her hair.

12:19.328 --> 12:21.562
It's okay. Uh, maybe we can talk
for just a minute.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.030
T-Totally.

12:23.099 --> 12:27.201
But not without hot cocoa
made from scratch

12:27.269 --> 12:28.836
with real chocolate shavings.

12:28.904 --> 12:30.170
Okay? Wait here.

12:30.239 --> 12:31.905
- I'll be back in 10 to 40 minutes.
- But...

12:32.007 --> 12:33.374
But why can't I bring a date?

12:33.476 --> 12:34.708
I think you'd really like Basil.

12:34.810 --> 12:36.677
He has a subscription to ancestry.com.

12:36.746 --> 12:38.445
Oh, why does everyone
want to bring a date?

12:38.547 --> 12:39.980
It's just a young girl's Confirmation.

12:40.082 --> 12:42.049
- It's not the prom.
- But you're bringing Clive.

12:42.118 --> 12:44.651
Only in an official capacity
as Shannon's godfather,

12:44.687 --> 12:46.120
not as my date.

12:46.188 --> 12:47.388
"Shannon's godfather"?

12:47.490 --> 12:48.522
What happened to Brendan?

12:48.624 --> 12:50.324
She fired him and hired Clive.

12:50.426 --> 12:51.859
What are you looking for?

12:51.961 --> 12:53.794
An excuse not to talk to Brett
right now.

12:53.863 --> 12:56.029
I didn't realize things had
gotten so serious with you two.

12:56.132 --> 12:58.665
Nothing is so serious with us two.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.768
What is happening?

13:00.836 --> 13:02.436
We are arranging flowers

13:02.538 --> 13:03.971
for Shannon's Confirmation brunch, okay?

13:04.073 --> 13:05.305
That's what's happening.

13:05.374 --> 13:08.242
And the hydrangeas are helping
the carnations pop, okay?

13:09.812 --> 13:12.179
Good God, parenting is hard.

13:12.281 --> 13:13.580
I'm sorry. What... What did you say?

13:13.682 --> 13:14.715
You're not a parent.

13:14.817 --> 13:16.583
No, I said, "Good godparenting is hard."

13:16.685 --> 13:17.885
It's hard to be a good godparent.

13:17.987 --> 13:19.319
- And it's a big deal.
- That's what I said.

13:19.422 --> 13:20.921
You know what? You zip it.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.856
And, you, just emphasize
the right words.

13:22.925 --> 13:25.159
I'm sorry. It's just...
I really need to talk to <i> you.</i>

13:25.261 --> 13:26.794
Wait. That wasn't right.

13:26.896 --> 13:29.129
I really need to talk <i>to</i> you.

13:29.231 --> 13:30.431
You're in my head.

13:30.499 --> 13:32.232
You know, just clean these.

13:32.301 --> 13:33.801
Hey, Kenny, can we please just talk?

13:33.903 --> 13:35.436
Uh, talk about cocoa?

13:35.538 --> 13:36.770
It was invented by the Mayans.

13:36.806 --> 13:39.264
Look, I-I realize you're freaking out

13:39.366 --> 13:40.399
because I said, "I love you,"

13:40.468 --> 13:42.042
and I did notice you didn't say it back.

13:42.111 --> 13:44.111
- You did?
- I did.

13:44.180 --> 13:45.145
But I don't...

13:45.247 --> 13:46.447
Oh. Chocolate's ready.

13:46.549 --> 13:48.248
Only eight more steps to cocoa.

13:49.051 --> 13:51.852
Hey, there, godfather.

13:51.921 --> 13:53.454
Shannon just told me the news.

13:53.522 --> 13:55.889
You're gonna be a part of
this family forever now, huh?

13:55.958 --> 13:57.691
That's a pretty big deal.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.059
It is not a big deal!

13:59.161 --> 14:00.727
It is just a young girl's Confirmation.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.596
You know what? Let's just
throw a frickin' party.

14:02.665 --> 14:04.064
Okay? You can bring a date.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.232
Yay!

14:05.301 --> 14:07.468
- And you can bring a date.
- No.

14:07.570 --> 14:09.236
Anyone who wants to can bring a date!

14:09.338 --> 14:11.405
Oh. Some of us don't have dates,

14:11.507 --> 14:14.374
because their father crushes
their dreams with his tongue.

14:14.477 --> 14:15.876
Oh, Jimmy, come on. Wait. Are you okay?

14:15.978 --> 14:16.877
- No!
- Wait.

14:16.979 --> 14:18.579
"No"? You don't want me there?

14:18.681 --> 14:21.982
No, um, I do want you there.

14:22.084 --> 14:23.717
I totally want you there.

14:25.421 --> 14:28.622
I want you there, because...

14:28.691 --> 14:30.424
<i>No, don't say it. You don't mean it.</i>

14:30.526 --> 14:32.025
<i>Don't say it.</i>

14:32.127 --> 14:33.861
...I love you.

14:35.598 --> 14:36.897
<i>Damn it, Kenny.</i>

14:36.999 --> 14:38.465
<i>What is the point of having
voices in your head</i>

14:38.567 --> 14:39.600
<i>if you don't listen to them?</i>

14:41.000 --> 14:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:49.330 --> 14:50.898
Why are you up?

14:50.966 --> 14:52.432
I'm trying to make this table
look perfect,

14:52.534 --> 14:55.268
but this vase looks stupid
wherever I put it.

14:55.346 --> 14:57.738
- Why are you up?
- Same reason.

14:57.806 --> 15:00.574
I could hear this vase
being stupid in my sleep.

15:03.212 --> 15:04.478
So, what's going on?

15:04.580 --> 15:06.747
You and VP Murray seem
even more awkward than usual.

15:06.815 --> 15:09.783
We're just at that point
in every relationship where,

15:09.852 --> 15:10.884
you know, you freak out a little

15:10.953 --> 15:12.319
'cause the person you're casually dating

15:12.388 --> 15:15.656
is gonna spiritually connected to
your family for all of eternity.

15:15.724 --> 15:17.057
I can see how that would be stressful.

15:17.159 --> 15:18.292
Mm.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.393
What about you and Brett?

15:19.495 --> 15:20.727
You know, we're just at that point

15:20.829 --> 15:22.362
where he tells me he loves me,

15:22.431 --> 15:23.931
and then I freak out and avoid him

15:24.033 --> 15:25.165
and then tell him I love him

15:25.234 --> 15:26.667
even though I don't know how I feel.

15:26.735 --> 15:28.135
Do you ever miss those times back when

15:28.203 --> 15:32.005
we used to hide all our secrets
and swallow our feelings?

15:32.074 --> 15:34.074
- So much.
- Mm.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.475
What do I tell him?

15:35.544 --> 15:37.077
I like him, I really, really do,

15:37.146 --> 15:38.278
but I don't think I love him yet,

15:38.347 --> 15:39.613
and I hate that I said that I did.

15:39.682 --> 15:41.915
Well, I think you should say
exactly that.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.951
You know, there's a lot of love in it,

15:44.019 --> 15:46.420
even if it doesn't have "I love you."

15:46.522 --> 15:49.156
Thank you.

15:49.258 --> 15:52.059
You're welcome.

15:52.127 --> 15:53.860
Do you want to go clean the oven?

15:53.963 --> 15:55.462
I would really like that.

15:55.564 --> 15:57.197
Me too.

16:05.607 --> 16:06.773
Did she die?

16:06.875 --> 16:08.041
Oh, so sad.

16:08.110 --> 16:11.812
Due to a clerical error,
we left one essay out.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.150
- What did you do?
- What did you do?

16:17.219 --> 16:18.452
Father Phil said we couldn't

16:18.520 --> 16:20.253
print Shannon's essay in
the program, but he never said

16:20.322 --> 16:21.788
we couldn't just stuff it in.

16:21.890 --> 16:25.225
God is not a woman
sitting at a typewriter

16:25.294 --> 16:27.060
wearing an A-line skirt
and sensible boots.

16:27.162 --> 16:28.295
I hear that.

16:28.397 --> 16:29.463
But just for the record,

16:29.531 --> 16:31.431
I always thought God was a woman, too,

16:31.533 --> 16:34.835
who looked a lot
or exactly like Bea Arthur.

16:34.903 --> 16:37.204
I knew you were up to something.

16:37.306 --> 16:38.805
It's correct to always assume that.

16:38.907 --> 16:40.440
So, what are we gonna do
when Father Phil finds out?

16:40.509 --> 16:41.475
Just play dumb.

16:41.577 --> 16:42.876
I've already laid the groundwork for it.

16:42.978 --> 16:44.911
You are one badass godfather.

16:45.014 --> 16:46.446
Mm.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.283
- She just kissed you.
- I know.

16:50.352 --> 16:52.486
Last time I was called a badass
was by my doctor

16:52.554 --> 16:54.725
who said I physically have a bad ass.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.557
- Clive, I owe you a huge apology.
- For what?

16:57.626 --> 16:59.626
Well, I've been so concerned
about this Confirmation...

16:59.695 --> 17:01.628
Who could be here and why...

17:01.697 --> 17:04.131
that I missed out on seeing

17:04.233 --> 17:05.765
what a wonderful godfather you're being.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.902
No one is more surprised than me
that I came through for her.

17:08.971 --> 17:11.104
So, how many of these did you hand out?

17:11.205 --> 17:12.439
- 200.
- Oh.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.207
Well, we have to get them all back.

17:14.309 --> 17:15.208
God is a man.

17:15.277 --> 17:16.510
On it like a bonnet.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.878
May I have that, please?
Thank you. I'll take that.

17:18.981 --> 17:20.347
And my third time on the site,

17:20.449 --> 17:22.315
I discover I'm an eighth Swedish,

17:22.384 --> 17:23.950
which makes me Swede-ish.

17:24.051 --> 17:26.619
That's a joke.

17:26.722 --> 17:28.755
Kill him. Or me.

17:28.857 --> 17:30.090
Hey, buddy.

17:30.159 --> 17:31.324
Now, I know you're disappointed

17:31.393 --> 17:32.626
with the way things turned out
with Heather,

17:32.694 --> 17:34.427
and I'm sorry that
she got between us, but...

17:34.530 --> 17:37.063
look who I found.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.901
Miss Short? What are you doing here?

17:40.969 --> 17:43.937
Your dad said you were
missing your old babysitter

17:44.039 --> 17:45.906
and that brunch was being served.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.209
Did you really think
this would make me forget

17:49.278 --> 17:51.044
- about what happened?
- I was hoping.

17:51.146 --> 17:52.345
Yeah, well...

17:52.414 --> 17:54.114
you were right.

17:54.216 --> 17:57.250
Miss Short, I have had such a bad week.

17:57.352 --> 17:59.452
Oh, sweetheart.

17:59.555 --> 18:02.255
Do you still like grapes cut in half?

18:02.357 --> 18:03.723
Very much.

18:08.530 --> 18:09.696
Mmm.

18:16.004 --> 18:16.870
Hey.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.171
Hey.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.974
I brought a gift. Is that weird?

18:21.076 --> 18:22.809
No. Great wrapping job.

18:22.911 --> 18:24.544
Uh, look, I have to talk to you.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.712
Okay.

18:25.781 --> 18:27.981
Yesterday you said,
"I love you," which...

18:28.083 --> 18:30.217
which was so incredible to hear.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.419
And then I said it back,

18:32.521 --> 18:34.854
which wasn't... entirely true.

18:34.957 --> 18:36.423
Okay.

18:36.491 --> 18:40.093
Because while I feel so many
amazing things for you,

18:40.195 --> 18:43.363
love just isn't one of them yet.

18:43.465 --> 18:44.864
I knew you were freaking out. I...

18:44.967 --> 18:48.001
No, it's just you're my first boyfriend,

18:48.103 --> 18:49.769
and I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling

18:49.838 --> 18:51.504
or how fast I'm supposed to be
feeling it.

18:51.607 --> 18:53.240
I just...

18:53.308 --> 18:55.141
I don't want to screw this up.

18:55.244 --> 18:56.676
Can you forgive me?

18:56.778 --> 18:59.012
Yeah. Sure.

19:01.483 --> 19:03.250
Or maybe we should hit the pause button.

19:03.318 --> 19:05.385
What? No. Brett, that is not...

19:05.454 --> 19:07.621
Tell Shannon I said congratulations.

19:12.227 --> 19:13.660
You okay?

19:15.197 --> 19:16.863
I don't think so.

19:16.965 --> 19:19.332
Come on.

19:27.242 --> 19:29.309
<i>According to Catholic doctrine,</i>

19:29.378 --> 19:31.044
<i>the sacrament of Confirmation</i>

19:31.146 --> 19:34.114
<i>strengthens our bond with the church.</i>

19:34.182 --> 19:38.752
<i>It can also remind us how
strong that bond already is...</i>

19:43.625 --> 19:45.492
<i>...how quickly that bond can be made...</i>

19:48.196 --> 19:51.831
<i>...or broken or...</i>

19:51.933 --> 19:54.834
<i>Well, I don't know what this is
exactly, but it's a bond.</i>

19:54.936 --> 19:57.904
<i>Which just leaves me</i>

19:58.006 --> 20:01.608
<i>alone again with my family.</i>

20:05.947 --> 20:09.316
<i>Well, maybe not so alone after all.</i>

20:11.814 --> 20:14.829
Oh. My. Gosh.

20:16.584 --> 20:18.418
All that hard work.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.620
I mean, they didn't even use the tongs.

20:20.722 --> 20:22.288
Like, what... what is the point?

20:22.390 --> 20:23.489
Animals.

20:23.591 --> 20:26.225
I'm gonna go get a trash bag.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.630
These are delish.

20:30.732 --> 20:32.130
Thanks, Jesus.

20:32.216 --> 20:33.566
Mm-hmm. How you doing, Kenny?

20:33.668 --> 20:36.636
I've had better days.

20:36.738 --> 20:38.171
Thank you for showing up for me.

20:38.273 --> 20:39.906
Well, I'm not here for you.

20:40.008 --> 20:41.140
I'm here for that thing.

20:41.242 --> 20:42.575
You know, just 'cause they sell it

20:42.677 --> 20:43.976
doesn't mean you have to buy it.

20:44.078 --> 20:46.345
It has a three-day return policy.

20:46.447 --> 20:47.747
So did I.

20:47.849 --> 20:51.617
Ooh! Resurrection humor.
Nice one, Jesus.

20:51.719 --> 20:53.452
Ah, I needed that.

20:53.555 --> 20:56.289
Well, if you can't laugh at yourself...
