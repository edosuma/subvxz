01:05.265 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:22.982 --> 01:25.746
<i>Hey, kids. Look who's making breakfast.</i>

01:25.852 --> 01:28.616
Itchy and Scratchy?

01:28.721 --> 01:30.313
That's right, kids!

01:30.423 --> 01:33.290
Never start the day
on an empty stomach.

01:36.763 --> 01:40.255
- It's delicious. Want to try?
- Yea!

01:44.104 --> 01:46.265
Ooh! So cold.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.141
Wow! Pink daggers!

01:50.243 --> 01:52.211
- Green hatchets!
- Yellow ice picks!

01:52.312 --> 01:55.406
And Stabby-Oh's are part of
this nutritious breakfast.

01:55.515 --> 02:00.043
- Hey. If you guys made breakfast, where's Mom?
- <i>Here I am.</i>

02:00.153 --> 02:04.351
But thanks to Stabby-Oh's,
most of me is still in bed.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.982
That ad campaign
may have crossed a line.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.889
Ah, what can you do?
Sex sells.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.857
Homer, you're still here?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.729
You should have left
for work an hour ago.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.793
They said if I come in late again,
I'm fired. I can't take that chance.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.305
And, kids, you're gonna miss the school bus.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.307
It's only two blocks away!

02:29.682 --> 02:32.776
- But I gotta spit.
- You can spit on the bus.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.246
- Uh, Mom.
- Not now, Lisa.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.461
Chew, chew, chew!
Swallow, swallow, swallow!

02:48.568 --> 02:50.468
Mmm!

02:54.307 --> 02:56.901
Aw, darn. Looks like
we'll have to stay home today.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.910
Not on my watch!

03:00.580 --> 03:03.174
Stop! Stop!

03:03.283 --> 03:05.979
Oh, you want to drag?

03:08.054 --> 03:10.921
Yeah!

03:12.992 --> 03:15.392
I'm not racing!

03:15.495 --> 03:18.362
It's me, Marge Simpson.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.591
No. You eat <i>my</i> dust!
Hoo-hoo!

03:34.214 --> 03:36.876
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>It's like</i> Speed 2...

03:36.983 --> 03:39.213
only with a bus instead of a boat.

03:51.464 --> 03:54.831
I did it!
I caught the school bus!

03:54.934 --> 03:58.131
- Now hurry up and get on.
- But, Mom, the school's right here.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.607
I won. Don't take that away from me.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.812
Okay. Everybody off.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.382
<i>Oops. Almost forgot.</i>

04:10.483 --> 04:12.951
Picking up a new kid today.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.123
Wow. A new kid.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.454
I wonder what they're like.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.364
Help me! Help me!

04:34.641 --> 04:37.508
<i>Aw, man.</i>

04:37.610 --> 04:40.807
- Red hair?
- What's she trying to pull?

04:40.913 --> 04:43.279
Those shoes look Canadian.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.351
She'll never fit in.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.722
Oh, it's tough being the new kid.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.722
Someone should go talk to her.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.724
Yeah. Somebody should.

04:53.826 --> 04:57.159
One Hour Dry Cleaner?
Man, that's fast.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.657
- Kids gone?
- Yep.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.235
It's great to have some time
just to ourselves, huh?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.304
You read my mind.

05:06.873 --> 05:08.841
So...

05:08.941 --> 05:11.000
this coffee's good, huh?

05:11.110 --> 05:13.271
Yeah. The, uh-

05:13.379 --> 05:15.472
The milk really takes the edge off.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.572
You know, I think
our marriage is-

05:17.684 --> 05:19.584
I got it!

05:19.686 --> 05:21.119
- No, I got it.
- No, I do.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.916
Your baby is dead.

05:24.023 --> 05:27.220
That's what you'd hear if your baby fell victim...

05:27.327 --> 05:30.854
to the thousands of death traps
lurking in the average American home.

05:30.963 --> 05:34.626
"Springfield Baby-Proofing"?

05:34.734 --> 05:36.668
You-You really scared us.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.602
Sorry about that.
But the truth is...

05:39.706 --> 05:41.799
your baby, Maggie Simpson, is dead!

05:41.908 --> 05:46.174
Dead tired of baby-proofers who
don't provide a free estimate.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.179
Let's start in the kitchen.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.580
Now, pretend I'm a baby.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.620
Me like to explore.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.622
That's a pretty big caboose
for a baby.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.625
Homer, don't be-Wow, that is huge.

06:00.727 --> 06:06.393
Ooh! Pretty colors. Me want a drink.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.535
Oh!

06:20.780 --> 06:23.715
She got it open.

06:23.816 --> 06:28.515
You see how quickly your baby could have
been drinking this "Similac Baby Formula"?

06:28.621 --> 06:30.851
No!

06:31.991 --> 06:35.586
Oh. This is such an eye-opener.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.687
I always pictured the kids
dying in the living room.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.993
Okay. With the window bars,
toilet latches...

06:41.100 --> 06:43.830
dingo alarm and grapefruit squirt shield,
your total cost would be-

06:43.936 --> 06:46.871
- Wow! I'm rich!
- Three dollars?

06:46.973 --> 06:49.703
- That doesn't seem so bad.
- That's the price of the clipboard.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.972
- Here's your estimate.
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.049
We don't need your
high-price safety junk.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.086
Thank you.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.860
Look at the new kid hogging the teeter-totter.
It's like she owns the place.

07:09.962 --> 07:13.261
Yeah! She thinks she's
<i>- Pig in the City.</i>

07:13.366 --> 07:16.597
Give her a break.
Remember your first day at school?

07:16.702 --> 07:19.364
Not as long as I keep taking these.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.871
Well, someone's gotta
make her feel welcome.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.413
Hi there.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.209
My name's Lisa.
What's yours?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.255
Now don't feel bad, honey.

07:40.359 --> 07:44.022
Did you know back in grade school,
I had a bully problem myself?

07:45.264 --> 07:48.199
# Everybody was
kung fu fighting #

07:50.636 --> 07:53.434
#Those cats were fast as lightning ##

07:56.542 --> 07:59.943
Good times.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.879
Why don't you try
reaching out to this new girl?

08:02.982 --> 08:06.543
- See if you two have a common interest.
- Hmm.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.280
Well, lots of people
like jazz fusion.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.959
Okay. That's in the maybe file.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.762
What if you two bond over
your Malibu Stacy dolls?

08:16.762 --> 08:18.593
What if you two bond over
your Malibu Stacy dolls?

08:18.698 --> 08:20.791
They're not dolls.
They're aspiration figures.

08:20.900 --> 08:21.867
But it might work.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.898
That baby-proofing crook
wanted to sell us...

08:30.009 --> 08:31.977
safety covers for
the electrical outlets.

08:32.078 --> 08:36.275
But I'll just draw bunny faces on them
to scare Maggie away.

08:36.948 --> 08:40.248
- She's not afraid of bunnies.
- She will be.

08:41.821 --> 08:44.381
Uh, Francine?

08:44.490 --> 08:47.152
I think we got off to a bad start.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.661
So- Hey!
You like Malibu Stacy too.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.424
Oh, yeah.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.864
And you like the same one I like...

08:54.967 --> 08:56.730
<i>with the grad student</i>
<i>glamour pack...</i>

08:56.836 --> 08:59.066
just like the one in my...

08:59.171 --> 09:01.071
Iocker.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.971
That's mine, isn't it?

09:06.312 --> 09:08.940
Tastes like yours.

09:11.517 --> 09:15.180
<i>How aboutjazz?</i>
<i>Do you likejazz?</i>

09:15.288 --> 09:17.222
I like jazz.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.655
Milhouse?
She got you too?

09:19.759 --> 09:22.751
Yeah, but it's not so bad.
I'm standing on Ralph.

09:22.862 --> 09:26.798
We're a totem pole.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.734
There and there.
See, honey?

09:32.838 --> 09:35.705
Daddy's protecting you from
all the sharp, scary things.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.833
Here. Hold this a sec.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.174
Ow!

09:40.279 --> 09:42.645
Oh, my-

09:42.748 --> 09:46.445
Ow! Okay, Maggie.
Put it down.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.248
Ow! Okay now. Put-

09:49.355 --> 09:51.880
it-
down.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.891
Oh!

09:53.993 --> 09:57.053
Okay. That's quite enough.
It's not funny anymore.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.630
D'oh! D'oh!

09:58.731 --> 10:02.098
No, no, no!

10:02.201 --> 10:04.101
Oh, Homie.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.967
Ow. Ooh. Ow.

10:07.073 --> 10:10.270
Now do you realize how unsafe
the American home is?

10:10.376 --> 10:13.573
Baby accidents occur
every three minutes.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.476
I'm the one who told you that.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.481
Yeah, but this is me talking.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.017
Look. I already encased
the telephone in concrete.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.417
How are you supposed to dial?

10:22.521 --> 10:25.149
Reach into these holes.
I use a carrot.

10:25.257 --> 10:28.715
Isn't that a little excessive?
I mean, how are the buttons dangerous?

10:28.828 --> 10:32.025
- Baby could order poison.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

10:34.700 --> 10:38.192
Poison Delivery Service.
A gift basket of poisons is on its way.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.966
Oh, I'm a horrible mother.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.973
Of course you are.

10:43.075 --> 10:46.238
Marge, I finally discovered
the reason God made me-

10:46.345 --> 10:49.337
to protect his tiniest,
most breakable creatures.

10:49.448 --> 10:52.508
And I've got to share
that gift with the world.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.982
Ow!

10:55.087 --> 10:56.987
Get her out of here.

10:57.089 --> 11:00.889
<i>Why you throwing tomatoes at yourself, huh?</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:02.927
Why you throwing
tomatoes at yourself?

11:03.029 --> 11:04.894
Your very question is faulty.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.328
You're faulty!

11:06.432 --> 11:09.094
Knock, knock.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.066
What do you want?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.934
Would you bullies be interested
in some bodyguard work?

11:14.040 --> 11:18.067
Oh, this is so funny. We were just
talking about moving into protection.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.772
We're offering a recess and lunch
package that's very affordable.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.714
Well, I'm gonna need full coverage.
My bully is highly aggressive.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.377
- Check out these Indian burns.
- Good technique.

11:27.486 --> 11:31.115
- Check it out.
- Ho-ho! Triple twist! Nice work!

11:31.223 --> 11:34.886
- You sure this was done by hand?
- Yeah. She's a real purist.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.895
"She"? Sorry. We don't do girls.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.592
- They bite and kick and scratch.
- And sometimes we fall in love.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.330
Wow. There's so much I don't
understand about bullying.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.430
Yeah. There's
a lot of history there.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.736
Did you know
it predates agriculture?

11:50.843 --> 11:52.743
- Mm-mmm.
- Let's walk.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.780
Finish the job.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.181
I just don't understand
Francine's motivation.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.324
Why does she only
go after the smart ones?

12:08.427 --> 12:12.193
That's like asking the square root
of a million. No one will ever know.

12:12.298 --> 12:15.597
Someone will.
I'm gonna crack the bully code.

12:15.701 --> 12:18.966
# Oh, de, doo, doo
Saving those babies #

12:19.071 --> 12:22.837
#And the soft spots on their head
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ##

12:22.942 --> 12:25.206
A pointy deity.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.714
And I've got the perfect solution.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.306
- Hmm?
- Oh, thank you.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.682
No more Shiva-related pokings.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.755
Yeah. And, you know,
down the line...

12:36.856 --> 12:39.848
you might want to switch to a nice, round Buddha.

12:39.959 --> 12:43.258
- But we are Hindu.
- So am I, but I don't get all huffy about it.

12:43.362 --> 12:47.992
<i># Just had a whim</i>
<i>to go take a swim #</i>

12:50.102 --> 12:54.368
<i># Out on a limb</i>
<i>Just haul off andjump right in #</i>

12:57.276 --> 13:00.040
<i># Slow down</i>
<i>Buckle up #</i>

13:00.146 --> 13:02.706
<i># Take the time, rehearse #</i>

13:02.815 --> 13:08.720
<i># Always safety first ##</i>

13:19.965 --> 13:23.731
Ach. 'Tis a mighty puddle of puke.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.135
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's all right, lad.

13:27.239 --> 13:30.572
It reminds me why
I got into this business.

13:30.676 --> 13:33.372
Willie, I need to see
the school security tapes.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.379
Security tapes?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.506
There's no security tapes.

13:37.616 --> 13:41.746
It's hard to miss the cameras.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.823
Aye. Willie's a stinkin' liar.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.655
Why does the school need to
watch us all the time?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.029
- School?
- Oh, here's the tape I need.

13:56.836 --> 14:01.466
Oh, my God. That roll of towels
is nearing the end!

14:01.574 --> 14:04.975
<i>Ach! It's on double red stripe!</i>

14:19.525 --> 14:21.618
How did she know I was there?

14:27.533 --> 14:31.230
<i>Hey. That time she looked</i>
<i>right at me and didn't touch me.</i>

14:33.305 --> 14:35.273
Hmm.

14:36.508 --> 14:39.807
Of course. The nose clip.

14:39.912 --> 14:42.540
Hey, Willie. I think I'm
onto something. Check this out.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.183
Not talking, eh, Willie?

14:46.285 --> 14:49.118
Just listen then.
I think I figured out...

14:49.221 --> 14:53.089
what sets off that big ape Francine.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.160
Willie?

14:55.261 --> 14:57.229
Willie? Whoa!

14:59.398 --> 15:01.332
Aha!

15:07.773 --> 15:11.607
Come on, people! Move it!
I want to see some sweat.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.110
I am not mastering another stair...

15:14.213 --> 15:18.343
until you explain the purpose
of this monstrous experiment.

15:18.450 --> 15:22.978
I believe the key to bully/nerd
antagonism lies in your drippings.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.956
- Then I shall drip like a pot roast.
- Excellent.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.754
Now don't mind the squeegee.

15:32.164 --> 15:36.294
Ah. Oh, the scraping seems wrong...

15:36.402 --> 15:39.030
but it feels so right.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.574
And so, as, uh,
heavyweight champion...

15:42.675 --> 15:46.543
recognized by nine of
the 14 sanctioning bodies...

15:46.645 --> 15:49.307
I sincerely urge you all
to stay in school.

15:49.415 --> 15:52.441
Uh, thank you.

15:52.551 --> 15:57.011
Thank you, Drederick Tatum.
That was truly a K.O.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.022
"Knockout Oration."

15:59.124 --> 16:03.060
- Need a ride home?
- You really don't want that. Trust me.

16:03.162 --> 16:07.428
Mr. Tatum, do you mind
if I swab you with this damp rag?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.626
No. Not at all.
Swab away.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.829
Whoa, whoa. Nobody
mentioned a beaker.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.997
Please?
It's for science.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.132
Oh, for science.
In that case, proceed.

16:17.242 --> 16:22.270
- Lisa, this is outrageous. Explain yourself.
- Shh! It's working. Look.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.481
- Nelson, what are you doing?
- I don't know.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.182
I can't help myself.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.658
Hey. Cut it out. I insist that you desist.

16:35.761 --> 16:39.060
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.098
Yes!

16:43.435 --> 16:46.700
- Please don't hurt me.
- You leave me little recourse.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.871
<i>And now</i>
<i>the Estrogen Network presents</i> Afternoon Yak.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.449
- Men.
- Boo!

16:59.551 --> 17:00.575
Canceled.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.984
The safe baby craze.

17:03.088 --> 17:06.615
It's sweeping Springfield,
thanks to one crusading parent.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.159
That's me!
Safety dance!

17:09.261 --> 17:11.194
#You can dance
You can dance #

17:11.296 --> 17:13.195
# Everybody look at
your pants ##

17:13.298 --> 17:15.732
But while Homer Simpson
has made our babies safe...

17:15.834 --> 17:20.237
he's made infant-related businesses cry-
all the way away from the bank.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.866
- How are your baby crutch sales?
- Uh, terrible, Kent.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.604
And cartoon character
Band-Aids, forget about it.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.976
Look at this baby. Not a scratch on him.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.242
And I got boat payments.

17:32.351 --> 17:36.117
The dream is over.
Shut her down, boys.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.421
Dear God.
What have I done?

17:43.529 --> 17:46.987
Babies of Springfield,
we need your help.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.397
Please, skin your knees.

17:49.501 --> 17:53.403
Put dice up your nose.
Let cats sleep on your face!

17:56.608 --> 17:59.839
Constant flying saucer attacks.

18:01.947 --> 18:05.508
The solution-
And thus the Earth is saved.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.710
- Hurrah.
- That's a winner, Steve.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.584
That's quite an act to follow, Lisa.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.249
I know. And the crowd is
so distinguished.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.724
The inventor of
the walkie-talkie is out there.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.126
- Where?
- Third row, near the aisle.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.393
Ooh. You're right.
And that's not his wife.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.196
Scientists. Scientists, please.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.635
Looking for some order.
Some order, please...

18:26.738 --> 18:29.138
with the eyes forward
and the hands neatly folded...

18:29.241 --> 18:31.141
and the paying of attention.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.177
Pi is exactly three!

18:34.546 --> 18:36.741
Very sorry that it had to
come to that, but...

18:36.849 --> 18:38.749
now that I have your attention...

18:38.851 --> 18:42.082
we have some exciting new research
from young Lisa Simpson.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.678
Let's bring her out and pay attention.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.088
- <i>She's just a little girl.</i>
- In the larval stage.
- Silly.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.716
Let's not listen.

18:50.829 --> 18:54.856
My study is entitled " Airborne Pheromones
and Aggression in Bullies."

18:54.967 --> 18:56.491
- Bullies?
- I'm afraid.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.866
For as long as there
have been smart people...

18:58.971 --> 19:01.166
there have been bullies
to prey on them.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.264
From Galileo...

19:03.375 --> 19:05.275
to Sir Isaac Newton...

19:05.377 --> 19:07.709
and even in the animal kingdom.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.748
But why do the brawny
prey on the brainy?

19:11.850 --> 19:13.977
- Is it jealousy?
- Yes. Yes.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.680
No. The reason is chemical.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.949
Not possible.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.252
- That's impossible. Chemicals are our friend.
- <i>She's a witch.</i>

19:21.360 --> 19:24.158
Please, Dr. Koop.
Let me demonstrate.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.191
This is my test subject, Francine.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.370
I'd like to thank her parents...

19:34.473 --> 19:36.873
for helping with the caging.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.205
Let me out of here!

19:39.311 --> 19:44.214
I have isolated the chemical which is
emitted by every geek, dork and four-eyes.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.546
I call it "Poindextrose."

19:46.652 --> 19:48.847
Whoo-hoo!
Simpsons rule!

19:48.954 --> 19:50.922
Sorry.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.852
You're dead, nerd!

19:57.963 --> 20:01.194
The bully has caught my scent,
and she's at maximum rage.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.428
Professor Frink.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.438
Very well, Lisa. I'll just finagle this- glayvin.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.031
Are you mad, Frink?
Put down that science pole!

20:19.251 --> 20:22.448
- Huh?
- My God, she stopped in her tracks.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.717
The little girl's invented
some sort of bully repellent.

20:25.824 --> 20:26.950
- Silly.
- Let's not listen.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.459
Actually, it's just
ordinary salad dressing.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.688
So that's where that went.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.061
The pungent vinegar
and tangy Roquefort...

20:34.166 --> 20:36.794
block the smell receptors,
rendering the bully harmless.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.738
Congratulations, Lisa.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.367
You are truly the standout
of this year's Big Science Thing.

20:45.477 --> 20:48.640
A gift certificate from JCPenney?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.511
Yes. You'll love their slacks.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.677
Oh, honey, we're so proud of you.

20:56.221 --> 20:59.987
So all her bullying was
just to get some attention.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.959
No, Dad. Didn't you listen
to anything I said?

21:03.061 --> 21:06.053
Just to get some attention.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.132
<i>Lisa, help!</i>

21:11.136 --> 21:13.036
<i>Yes! Yes! I'm gonna-</i>

21:13.138 --> 21:16.699
- The repellent's all gone.
- Don't worry. She'll punch herself out.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.969
Suck fist, Dr. Dork!

21:19.077 --> 21:21.341
Someone's gonna sleep well tonight.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.707
What a cutie.

21:26.818 --> 21:29.286
Look at her pound that nerd.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.868
<i># I'm feeling free #</i>

21:47.973 --> 21:49.941
<i># I'll go climb a tree #</i>

21:52.110 --> 21:56.171
<i># Oh, monkey me</i>
<i>I'm just like a chimpanzee #</i>

21:58.784 --> 22:04.017
<i># But it's way too high and so</i>
<i>this time I'll just pretend #</i>

22:05.190 --> 22:07.215
<i># Oh #</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:10.420
<i># Then I will live</i>
<i>to climb again #</i>

22:11.596 --> 22:13.564
<i># Oh, oh #</i>

22:14.700 --> 22:17.692
<i># Oh, oh #</i>

22:17.803 --> 22:22.866
<i># Ah, just remember#</i>

22:22.974 --> 22:28.879
<i># Always safety first ##</i>
