WEBVTT

00:05.357 --> 00:06.491
Okay, she's almost here.

00:06.492 --> 00:08.000
Which ones,
these or these?

00:08.002 --> 00:09.935
Rae, you always freak out
every time

00:09.936 --> 00:11.263
your cousin Andrea comes in
from Europe.

00:11.264 --> 00:12.107
Girl, I am fine.

00:12.108 --> 00:13.631
I just need to know what hat
says, you know

00:13.632 --> 00:15.987
"Thanks for coming, but you need
to go back to Paris."

00:16.682 --> 00:19.204
Rae, she's only going to be here
for a little while.

00:19.205 --> 00:21.380
Okay, I understand that,
but does this belt say

00:21.381 --> 00:22.754
"Just because we're relatives

00:22.755 --> 00:24.555
doesn't mean
I have to like you?"

00:26.327 --> 00:27.691
Okay, where's Andrea?

00:27.692 --> 00:28.630
Is my little

00:28.631 --> 00:30.528
French pastry
here yet?

00:31.653 --> 00:32.302
No.

00:32.304 --> 00:34.017
Why do you like her so much?

00:34.018 --> 00:35.223
She is such a snob.

00:35.224 --> 00:37.272
Because she's not like the other
girls around here, Rae.

00:37.273 --> 00:39.826
I mean, she's lived in Rome,
London, Paris...

00:39.827 --> 00:42.196
and she's turned me down
in four different languages.

00:43.697 --> 00:45.696
"Nein," "nyet," "non"

00:45.697 --> 00:48.409
and the ever-popular
"ain't gonna happen."

00:49.992 --> 00:50.676
You know what?

00:50.677 --> 00:52.033
She is phony.

00:52.034 --> 00:53.418
I can't stand that about her.

00:53.419 --> 00:54.797
Look who's here.

00:55.227 --> 00:56.926
Oh, Ravey!

00:56.927 --> 00:59.030
Oh, Andrea, my girl!

00:59.031 --> 00:59.952
What is going on?

00:59.953 --> 01:01.324
Smooches.

01:02.255 --> 01:05.032
And listen,
it's "An-drea" now.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.336
I changed it

01:06.337 --> 01:07.996
when we moved to "Pa-ree."

01:07.997 --> 01:10.406
We live right near
the Eiffel Tower.

01:10.407 --> 01:12.504
That's the tall, pointy thing

01:12.505 --> 01:14.112
you might've seen in magazines.

01:18.297 --> 01:21.052
Ooh, girl, how I will
miss that sense of humor

01:21.053 --> 01:22.456
when you go back.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.431
When is that exactly?

01:25.657 --> 01:28.053
In a week,
but until then

01:28.054 --> 01:30.261
we're going to have
a nice family visit

01:30.262 --> 01:31.496
unlike the last time

01:31.497 --> 01:33.611
when the gum was
put in the hair.

01:33.612 --> 01:36.061
After the doll was put
in the toilet.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.594
She started it.
She started it.

01:44.456 --> 01:46.710
So, um, Andrea

01:46.711 --> 01:47.944
Andrea, you
remember

01:47.945 --> 01:48.977
Eddie and Chelsea?

01:48.978 --> 01:50.156
So, Chelsea

01:50.157 --> 01:52.025
Corey tells me
you two are dating.

01:52.927 --> 01:53.802
What?

01:53.803 --> 01:56.160
We got to share our love, baby.
Share it.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.856
Well, I'm going
to go freshen up now.

02:00.857 --> 02:04.897
You know how tiring those long
international flights can be.

02:06.058 --> 02:07.376
Oh, right.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.756
You don't.

02:08.757 --> 02:10.155
See you, Ravey.

02:10.156 --> 02:12.578
Oh... bye, girl.

02:12.579 --> 02:13.923
See you soon.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.531
"Oh, see you, Ravey."

02:16.532 --> 02:17.862
"Pa-ree."

02:18.345 --> 02:19.840
Oh, she gets
on my nerves.

02:19.841 --> 02:21.520
Everything is so perfect
with her.

02:21.521 --> 02:23.742
Perfect life, perfect hair,
perfect shoes.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.208
And then she comes
into my life

02:25.209 --> 02:26.990
interrupts everything,
and, you know...

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.439 --> 02:36.698
...kisses Eddie?

03:28.878 --> 03:30.190
Yep, that's me.

03:35.327 --> 03:37.724
You actually had a vision
of Eddie kissing Andrea?

03:37.725 --> 03:40.313
Really? Don't you
toy with me, woman.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.828
Eddie, how could you kiss her?

03:42.829 --> 03:44.529
I mean, you know
how I feel about her.

03:44.530 --> 03:45.608
I didn't do anything.

03:45.609 --> 03:46.649
Yeah, but you're going to.

03:46.650 --> 03:48.147
Not if you don't
want me to, Rammie.

03:48.148 --> 03:49.644
Come on, you know
that we're friends.

03:49.645 --> 03:51.954
You know, if you want her
out of your life

03:51.955 --> 03:53.698
this kiss might not be
such a bad thing

03:53.699 --> 03:55.161
'cause if she's busy
with Eddie all week

03:55.162 --> 03:56.459
she won't be around
to bug you.

03:56.460 --> 03:57.589
What kind of friend would I be

03:57.590 --> 03:58.335
if I did that
to Eddie?

03:58.336 --> 03:59.131
A good friend.

04:00.563 --> 04:01.642
A best friend.

04:01.643 --> 04:03.304
So when do
I kiss her?

04:03.997 --> 04:05.335
I don't know when,
but I know

04:05.336 --> 04:06.700
you guys were
standing here.

04:06.701 --> 04:07.268
Over there?
Right there.

04:07.269 --> 04:08.252
Right here?
Right there.

04:08.253 --> 04:10.107
Right here?
Eddie, right there.

04:15.426 --> 04:16.954
What you doing with your face?

04:16.954 --> 04:18.991
Oh, this is my kissing face.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.069
Watch up, now.

04:22.474 --> 04:24.162
That explains so much.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.106
Sure does.
Really...

04:25.107 --> 04:26.493
Here I am, all.

04:27.090 --> 04:28.056
Miss me?

04:28.057 --> 04:29.211
I know I did.

04:30.539 --> 04:32.361
Well, um, you know, Andrea

04:32.362 --> 04:33.770
our-our friend Eddie here--

04:33.771 --> 04:35.195
he made the basketball team
this year.

04:35.196 --> 04:37.743
Oh, you know,
he's also such a good rapper.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.896
Oh, my goodness, look!

04:39.897 --> 04:41.353
These marks are still

04:41.354 --> 04:42.626
here, Ravey.

04:42.627 --> 04:44.759
Remember when your dad used
to measure us?

04:44.760 --> 04:45.871
You'd get so angry

04:45.872 --> 04:50.262
that I was always just
a little bit taller than you.

04:51.744 --> 04:53.127
I don't remember that.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.411
So...

04:56.597 --> 04:59.581
So, isn't your dad a
colonel in the Army?

04:59.582 --> 05:02.102
Yes, and we get to travel
all over the world

05:02.103 --> 05:04.726
and meet lots
of fascinating people, but

05:04.727 --> 05:08.355
once a year I take a break
from all that excitement and...

05:08.356 --> 05:10.134
visit Raven.

05:10.957 --> 05:13.399
Well, actually, since
you moved to Paris

05:13.400 --> 05:14.413
it's Rah-ven.

05:18.304 --> 05:20.973
You're saying Cousin Andrea
can sleep in my room?

05:20.974 --> 05:23.606
You did not tell me
I had to sleep on the couch.

05:23.607 --> 05:25.053
Oh, come on, Corey.

05:25.054 --> 05:26.384
Think of it as
an adventure.

05:26.385 --> 05:27.396
It'll be fun.

05:27.397 --> 05:29.496
Down here all by yourself.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.592
But whatever you do,
don't open the coat closet

05:32.895 --> 05:35.097
'cause you never know
what might be hiding in there.

05:37.703 --> 05:39.709
What is hiding in there?

05:41.309 --> 05:42.146
No way...

05:42.147 --> 05:43.256
No way.

05:43.257 --> 05:44.296
Corey!

05:44.297 --> 05:45.791
It was a joke.

05:55.918 --> 05:58.497
"Don't open the
coat closet"?

05:59.055 --> 06:00.497
It was a joke.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.858
Okay, now,
when Andrea comes downstairs

06:12.859 --> 06:13.675
I'm going to say

06:13.676 --> 06:15.250
that I can't
do anything after school

06:15.251 --> 06:16.596
because I'm busy.

06:16.597 --> 06:17.891
That is where you come in.

06:17.892 --> 06:19.354
Then I kiss her?

06:20.645 --> 06:21.692
No, Eddie.

06:21.933 --> 06:24.557
Then you ask her to do something
after school.

06:24.559 --> 06:25.812
Right, right.

06:26.028 --> 06:27.676
Then I kiss her?

06:28.132 --> 06:29.828
No, Eddie.

06:29.830 --> 06:32.110
Then you take her out,
get to know her

06:32.112 --> 06:33.509
make her laugh.

06:33.964 --> 06:35.327
Then you kiss her.

06:35.329 --> 06:36.268
Yeah.

06:37.198 --> 06:39.097
Bonjour, mes amis.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.179
Oh, hi.

06:40.181 --> 06:41.406
I just dropped by

06:41.408 --> 06:43.608
to see if Raven wanted
to walk to school.

06:43.610 --> 06:44.810
Oh, Eddie.

06:44.812 --> 06:47.325
I would love to,
but if you're thinking

06:47.327 --> 06:48.953
about doing anything
after school

06:48.955 --> 06:50.960
I can't
'cause you know I'm busy.

06:51.734 --> 06:52.834
Oh, please.

06:52.836 --> 06:55.236
You don't have to tell me
about busy.

06:55.238 --> 06:56.662
I'm head of the Honor Society

06:56.664 --> 06:58.818
and still have time
to edit the yearbook.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.612
Very interesting.

07:01.977 --> 07:03.522
Uh, well, you know

07:03.524 --> 07:05.639
I barely have time
to read the yearbook

07:05.641 --> 07:06.394
because, you know

07:06.396 --> 07:08.125
I'm head of the volleyball team

07:08.128 --> 07:10.201
and head of, you know,
the Cheerleaders...

07:10.203 --> 07:11.957
Society.

07:13.939 --> 07:15.030
Cheerleaders
Society?

07:15.032 --> 07:15.962
Yes.

07:15.997 --> 07:17.181
It's new.

07:18.301 --> 07:19.466
We, you know...

07:19.468 --> 07:20.212
We-we do...

07:20.214 --> 07:21.997
We cheerlead
for the elderly.

07:23.497 --> 07:25.128
It raises their spirits.

07:25.872 --> 07:27.828
We go, like, uh, uh

07:27.830 --> 07:31.153
Go... old people!

07:31.155 --> 07:32.785
Don't mess with me.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.946
You know, Ravey,
since you're so busy later

07:41.948 --> 07:44.482
maybe I'll just go to school
with you right now.

07:48.897 --> 07:52.457
So, there I was just walking
down the Champs ElysÃ©es.

07:52.459 --> 07:53.849
when this photographer--

07:53.851 --> 07:55.257
he walks up to me, and he says

07:55.292 --> 07:57.695
"Aren't you Tyra Banks?"

07:58.857 --> 08:00.424
All right.
Yeah, man.

08:01.410 --> 08:02.728
Oh, man.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.746
Look at her.

08:06.101 --> 08:07.722
She been like that all day.

08:07.757 --> 08:09.522
And everybody thinks
she's so cool

08:09.557 --> 08:11.857
'cause, you know, she eats
in Europe, shops in Europe

08:11.892 --> 08:13.664
goes to school in Europe,
drinks in Europe...

08:13.666 --> 08:14.625
Okay, we
got it, Rae.

08:14.627 --> 08:16.340
Europe thing--
not good.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.641
This has been the worst day
I've ever had.

08:20.643 --> 08:23.045
I'm having the best day ever.

08:23.047 --> 08:24.108
Girl, me, too.

08:27.597 --> 08:30.078
Hey, Ravey,
why don't you introduce me

08:30.080 --> 08:31.761
to your cheerleading squad?

08:31.763 --> 08:33.297
You're the Captain.

08:34.626 --> 08:37.174
Well, let's go
meet us some girls. Come on.

08:37.176 --> 08:38.611
Hey, Squad.

08:38.614 --> 08:40.450
What's going on?
I made up a new cheer.

08:40.452 --> 08:41.967
Okay, diamond position, girls.

08:41.969 --> 08:43.582
Two, four, six, eight.

08:43.585 --> 08:45.224
That is the way we like to...

08:45.292 --> 08:46.392
Count.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.230
All right, Angie, work on that.

08:48.232 --> 08:50.346
April, you need some help. Okay.

08:52.827 --> 08:55.293
So, um, where's Eddie?

08:55.295 --> 08:56.062
Because, you know

08:56.097 --> 08:58.700
after school I got a
million other things to do.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.321
Oh, bonjour, guys.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.368
How's it going?

09:02.403 --> 09:04.355
Bonjour.

09:05.509 --> 09:08.209
Oh, American boys are so cute.

09:08.211 --> 09:11.997
If only I didn't have Jean Paul
waiting for me back in Paris.

09:12.032 --> 09:14.294
Oh, he misses me so much.

09:14.296 --> 09:16.532
You know how boyfriends
are, Ravey?

09:16.697 --> 09:18.979
Oh, um, I'm sorry, you don't.

09:20.102 --> 09:23.357
Well, actually, I do know
how boyfriends are.

09:24.179 --> 09:25.927
Yeah, she does.

09:25.929 --> 09:27.115
Y- ye...

09:27.527 --> 09:29.397
Y- yeah, 'cause I have one.

09:30.897 --> 09:33.162
Yeah, she does.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.630
He makes your Jean Paul

09:34.632 --> 09:36.375
look like French toast.

09:36.662 --> 09:38.118
French toast!

09:41.657 --> 09:45.766
'Cause he is charming, cute,
and there for me.

09:45.768 --> 09:46.697
And he is...

09:46.699 --> 09:47.360
Eddie.

09:47.394 --> 09:48.592
Eddie?

09:48.627 --> 09:49.742
Bon Jovi, y'all.

09:50.522 --> 09:54.015
Oh, boyfriend,
you say the cutest things.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.344
Come on, Boo.

09:55.981 --> 09:56.968
Who's Boo?

09:57.003 --> 09:58.027
Boo you.

10:04.857 --> 10:08.249
Okay, okay, I know I shouldn't
have said we were going out

10:08.251 --> 10:11.562
but she made me so mad.

10:11.757 --> 10:13.643
Can't you just be my boyfriend
for one week?

10:13.645 --> 10:14.568
What's the big deal?

10:14.570 --> 10:17.085
Because in a week,
Andrea will be gone.

10:17.087 --> 10:18.157
You had a vision.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.099
Now, I had that
same vision.

10:20.232 --> 10:21.151
I want that kiss.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.518
You promised me
that kiss.

10:23.334 --> 10:25.471
Okay, Eddie,
I just can't back down now.

10:25.473 --> 10:27.465
She will never let me
live it down.

10:27.467 --> 10:28.715
But I'm a man.

10:28.717 --> 10:30.456
I have feelings.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.318
I need to be held, Rae.

10:33.678 --> 10:36.158
Okay, Eddie, don't make me
come over there, and...

10:36.565 --> 10:41.363
give you the biggest hug
my Eddie Bear has ever had!

10:41.462 --> 10:43.674
What?! She's there, isn't she?

10:43.676 --> 10:46.475
Oh, I miss you too,
Pookie.

10:46.477 --> 10:48.291
Okay, now, Rae, that's it.

10:48.293 --> 10:50.212
I'm drawing the line
at "Pookie."

10:50.893 --> 10:54.093
Um, do you think Eddie would want to
come over for dinner tomorrow night?

10:55.197 --> 10:57.027
I'd love to, I'd love to

10:57.062 --> 10:58.822
I'd love to, I'd love to...!

10:59.582 --> 11:01.526
You know, he says
he's kind of busy.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.597
Let me talk to him.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.322
Eddie?

11:10.681 --> 11:12.624
Eddie, it's Andrea.

11:13.394 --> 11:15.727
Listen, I insist
you join us for dinner to...

11:15.729 --> 11:16.824
I'd love to!

11:19.088 --> 11:21.641
Well, well, seems
he just can't

11:21.643 --> 11:22.622
say no to me.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.497
And as a special treat

11:25.499 --> 11:27.054
I'll cook dinner.

11:27.056 --> 11:30.383
Oh, that won't be necessary
because I'm an excellent cook

11:30.385 --> 11:33.103
and no one cooks for my man
but me.

11:33.105 --> 11:34.257
Good night.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.792
Sofa bed?

11:47.827 --> 11:50.983
As long as you don't
open the coat closet.

11:52.454 --> 11:54.192
That was a joke.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.023
I woke up, and you weren't there!

12:02.392 --> 12:05.220
Please let this
be a dream.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.137
Climb in.

12:10.727 --> 12:12.226
Snuggle up to your father.

12:17.897 --> 12:23.887
# My little angel,
sleep, sleep tight #

12:24.541 --> 12:30.033
# And in your sweet dreams
through the night #

12:30.808 --> 12:38.796
# Just snuggle close, dear,
I hope this never ends... #

12:43.093 --> 12:51.123
# Dream, dream sweet dreams,
my little angel... #

12:51.492 --> 12:53.606
First you tell me
Andrea's going to kiss me

12:53.608 --> 12:54.727
then you make me
your boyfriend

12:54.729 --> 12:56.029
so I can't kiss her.

12:56.031 --> 12:58.026
I mean, this
is one big psychic rip-off.

12:59.427 --> 13:01.142
You think it's easy
being your girl?

13:01.177 --> 13:03.213
Okay, you don't
take me anywhere

13:03.215 --> 13:04.300
you don't buy me anything.

13:04.302 --> 13:05.527
It's not like I got ice

13:05.562 --> 13:07.018
all right?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.327
I sweat over a hot stove

13:08.329 --> 13:10.629
and all you do
is nag, nag, nag.

13:12.147 --> 13:13.579
Okay, Rae, this
is really starting

13:13.581 --> 13:14.962
to get a little weird.

13:17.145 --> 13:19.530
So, what's for dinner,
sweetheart?

13:20.969 --> 13:22.939
Stuffed crab Imperial.

13:22.941 --> 13:24.898
Chelsea's down at the
Sea Lion restaurant

13:24.900 --> 13:26.054
picking it up now.

13:26.593 --> 13:28.506
So, what's
all this boiling water for?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.120
Well, you know, I got
to create the illusion

13:31.122 --> 13:32.634
that I'm cooking,
you know.

13:33.941 --> 13:35.497
That water
needs a dash more salt.

13:35.532 --> 13:36.927
Bam!

13:40.274 --> 13:41.476
Ooh, Chelsea, so

13:41.478 --> 13:42.596
how did everything go
at the restaurant?

13:42.667 --> 13:43.642
Well, actu...

13:44.259 --> 13:47.568
Ravey,
how's everything going...?

13:47.570 --> 13:48.689
Ah-ah-ah!

13:48.691 --> 13:49.889
No peeking.

13:52.559 --> 13:54.959
I think we all need to
go into the dining room

13:54.961 --> 13:56.731
and get settled,
so, come on.

13:59.753 --> 14:02.228
All right, boyfriend,
tell me you love me.

14:02.262 --> 14:03.422
No.

14:03.457 --> 14:04.563
Well, then, say
I look pretty.

14:04.565 --> 14:05.207
No.

14:05.209 --> 14:06.281
Say something nice.

14:06.283 --> 14:07.617
Your cousin
looks hot tonight.

14:09.571 --> 14:10.978
Let me get that for you.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.584
Oh, you are so thoughtful.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.087
Thank you, Edward.

14:15.089 --> 14:17.354
Oh, you're
very welcome.

14:18.327 --> 14:19.672
Hey, is dinner ready?

14:19.675 --> 14:21.059
Oh, just about.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.360
Are you two
feeling better?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.692
Not much.

14:23.727 --> 14:26.042
That sofa bed
really messed up our necks.

14:26.077 --> 14:28.340
I don't know why,
'cause I slept like a baby.

14:29.309 --> 14:30.497
We know.
We know.

14:33.327 --> 14:35.682
Thank you so much,
Chelsea.

14:35.684 --> 14:36.743
Oh, my goodness,
this looks

14:36.744 --> 14:39.701
so good-- rice almondine,
fresh vegetables...

14:39.732 --> 14:41.822
Okay, where's
the crab Imperial?

14:42.814 --> 14:44.550
In the box.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.527
Chelse...

14:53.297 --> 14:54.428
It's still kicking.

14:55.239 --> 14:57.138
I know, I know, Rae,
b- but look

14:57.197 --> 14:59.173
that awful restaurant,
they wanted to kill them

14:59.175 --> 15:01.555
and I saved them.

15:01.557 --> 15:03.626
Look, look, look,
I saved Fred and Ethel

15:03.628 --> 15:04.970
and Little Ricky.

15:05.956 --> 15:07.621
Uh, you know what, Chelse?

15:07.623 --> 15:10.897
It's okay, 'cause I understand
that you love the animals

15:10.932 --> 15:12.557
and I'm all for it, girl.

15:12.592 --> 15:13.773
I respect that.

15:16.395 --> 15:17.803
Rae?
Huh?

15:17.827 --> 15:19.422
What you doing?

15:19.424 --> 15:21.828
I'm just showing it
around the kitchen, really.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.863
Hey, Freddie,
this is the kitchen

15:23.865 --> 15:25.755
here's the refrigerator,
and here's the hot pot

15:25.757 --> 15:26.715
of boiling water!

15:26.717 --> 15:28.592
Raven, you can't!
I have to.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.746
I have a snobby cousin in there
I have to impress.

15:30.748 --> 15:31.544
Sorry, crabby.

15:31.546 --> 15:33.469
Give it to me, Rae,
give it to me!

15:33.471 --> 15:35.312
No, no, no!

15:37.431 --> 15:39.234
Everything okay in there?

15:45.497 --> 15:46.717
Fine!

15:48.838 --> 15:50.827
I cannot believe
that this crab

15:50.829 --> 15:51.894
is attached
to our head.

15:51.896 --> 15:53.026
Ah...!

15:53.257 --> 15:55.192
Rae, Rae, r-remember

15:55.227 --> 15:57.477
he's more scared of
us than we are of him.

15:57.512 --> 15:59.012
Hey, we're
getting hungry out here.

15:59.015 --> 15:59.922
Uh, we're coming!

15:59.924 --> 16:00.894
What are we going
to do?!

16:00.896 --> 16:02.189
There's scissors
over there.

16:02.530 --> 16:04.134
Wait-wait, ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

16:04.136 --> 16:05.430
Okay, we'll
cut your hair.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.808
We'll cut
your hair, Rae.

16:06.811 --> 16:07.968
Huh?! I'm sorry?!

16:07.970 --> 16:09.790
Why can't we cut yours?

16:09.792 --> 16:12.060
All right, scissors--
bad idea.

16:12.062 --> 16:12.935
Yeah.

16:14.466 --> 16:16.886
Look who came
to help me serve the salad.

16:17.907 --> 16:21.715
Yes. No one serves salad
like I do.

16:21.717 --> 16:24.154
Raven, do you need any help
in the kitchen?

16:24.157 --> 16:25.788
Oh, no,
everything's under control.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.519
Yes. All right,
here's some salad

16:27.521 --> 16:28.686
Mr. Baxter.

16:28.688 --> 16:33.208
Okay, and here's some
for Mrs. Baxter.

16:34.764 --> 16:36.141
And here's some...

16:36.143 --> 16:37.516
for Corey!

16:38.182 --> 16:40.169
She always gets
a little emotional

16:40.171 --> 16:41.751
when she says my name.

16:42.797 --> 16:44.754
Here's some for Eddie.

16:44.756 --> 16:46.350
There you
go, Eddie.

16:46.352 --> 16:47.809
Oh, sorry about that.

16:47.811 --> 16:51.309
All right, and your main dish
will be up, okay?

16:51.311 --> 16:52.903
What are we having, anyway?

16:52.906 --> 16:54.786
Girl, we are having crab.

16:54.787 --> 16:57.425
Really, really...
fresh crab.

16:58.028 --> 16:59.275
And your salad

16:59.277 --> 17:00.937
servers will be leaving now.

17:00.939 --> 17:03.591
Buh-bye, buh-bye, buh-bye.

17:03.632 --> 17:05.236
See ya.
See ya.

17:12.291 --> 17:15.798
Raven is so lucky to
have a guy like you.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.531
She is?

17:19.184 --> 17:20.776
Almost. Okay, I think
I've got it, Rae.

17:20.778 --> 17:21.519
Just hold on.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.720
One, two...

17:23.671 --> 17:25.021
Oh, I'm free.

17:25.566 --> 17:28.666
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

17:28.668 --> 17:30.327
Can you help me?

17:31.427 --> 17:33.897
Hey, Rae, I think your
cousin's coming on to me.

17:33.932 --> 17:35.738
And you got a crab
in your hair.

17:36.727 --> 17:38.426
I know.
How do you like it?

17:39.291 --> 17:41.351
Eddie, Andrea cannot
see Rae like this.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.585
Go watch the door.

17:43.748 --> 17:44.379
You know what?

17:44.381 --> 17:45.454
That's just like Andrea.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.401
As soon as she finds out
that you're my boyfriend

17:47.403 --> 17:48.701
she's all over you.

17:48.703 --> 17:50.174
Yo, Andrea's coming.

17:50.257 --> 17:52.427
Oh, I can't let her
see me like this.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.158
Here, take it,
take it.

17:56.357 --> 17:58.197
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do?

17:58.232 --> 17:59.437
Uh, no.

17:59.439 --> 18:00.653
I'll help
cook the crab.

18:00.656 --> 18:01.786
No, really, no, please!

18:01.788 --> 18:03.755
You're the
guest, really.

18:03.756 --> 18:05.122
Please, you're
the guest.

18:06.057 --> 18:07.597
No, I want to.
Please, you're the guest.

18:07.599 --> 18:08.941
Where is Raven?!

18:10.907 --> 18:12.304
Upstairs.

18:12.306 --> 18:15.119
You know, she and Eddie
had this huge fight

18:15.121 --> 18:16.421
and they broke up.

18:16.883 --> 18:18.560
What is taking so long?

18:18.562 --> 18:20.323
Are those restaurant
containers?

18:20.357 --> 18:22.727
It sounds like Eddie and Raven
broke up.

18:22.762 --> 18:23.897
What?
What?

18:25.557 --> 18:27.962
Eddie and Raven
aren't going out

18:27.997 --> 18:30.845
because if they were,
Eddie would have told us.

18:30.847 --> 18:32.477
Isn't that right, son?

18:33.706 --> 18:36.956
Uh, Rae,
a little help here.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.627
Hey, everybody.

18:46.491 --> 18:48.060
Y'all enjoy your salads?

18:48.576 --> 18:49.972
What is going on?

18:53.781 --> 18:55.122
Okay.

18:55.571 --> 18:57.139
Eddie and I
aren't dating.

18:57.141 --> 18:59.370
Okay, it was all a joke,
just like this dinner.

19:00.169 --> 19:01.464
All to impress her.

19:01.562 --> 19:02.919
So, here.

19:02.921 --> 19:04.327
Eddie, you want her?

19:06.270 --> 19:07.727
You can have her.

19:08.927 --> 19:10.793
I got to go see if Rae is okay.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.957
No. This is between
my cousin and me.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.028
I think we need to talk.

19:29.783 --> 19:30.976
Why is that?

19:31.496 --> 19:33.507
Are you here to brag
about something else

19:33.508 --> 19:35.482
to make me feel even
worse about my life?

19:36.327 --> 19:39.327
Oh, no, here, I'll save
you the trouble, okay?

19:39.362 --> 19:40.762
I lied.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.671
I'm not head
of the volleyball squad

19:43.673 --> 19:45.897
I'm not head cheerleader,
and I can't cook.

19:45.932 --> 19:47.497
So, congratulations.

19:48.026 --> 19:49.212
You win.

19:49.214 --> 19:50.767
Your life is better than mine.

19:55.801 --> 19:56.717
Rae.

19:58.342 --> 19:59.532
Hold on.

20:00.097 --> 20:02.957
You actually think my
life is better than yours?

20:03.244 --> 20:04.857
You sure make it seem that way.

20:04.892 --> 20:06.262
Well, it's not.

20:06.297 --> 20:08.687
I live in a different country
every year.

20:08.689 --> 20:09.670
I change homes.

20:09.672 --> 20:11.262
I have to make
new friends.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.557
Believe me, Rae, you don't know
how lucky you are.

20:14.592 --> 20:16.944
But I don't shop in Rome, okay?

20:16.946 --> 20:18.508
And I don't live in Paris.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.923
Oh, I'd trade
all that for this.

20:22.242 --> 20:24.487
Look, you were standing
right here

20:24.490 --> 20:28.037
when you were two and four
and seven and nine.

20:28.387 --> 20:29.624
I don't have that.

20:29.626 --> 20:31.409
I don't have a real home
like you do.

20:33.142 --> 20:35.483
Oh, and you'll really love
this one.

20:37.039 --> 20:38.799
I don't have a boyfriend,
either.

20:39.287 --> 20:41.042
I made him up
to impress you

20:41.044 --> 20:43.933
because I thought
you had the better life.

20:45.192 --> 20:46.633
So, I don't win.

20:47.266 --> 20:48.119
You do.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.813
You mean... we wasted 14 years
of trying to impress each other

20:53.814 --> 20:55.162
when we could have been friends?

20:57.716 --> 20:59.019
Want to start over again?

21:00.027 --> 21:01.189
Sure.

21:04.710 --> 21:07.286
You know that, uh, red bag
you had on the other day?

21:09.182 --> 21:10.391
Can I borrow it?

21:11.827 --> 21:14.082
Only if you tell me
where you got those shoes.

21:14.084 --> 21:15.111
Girl, yeah, it was on sale.

21:15.113 --> 21:16.115
All right!

21:16.804 --> 21:18.079
I'm sorry.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.579
You remember
that pony I had?

21:29.322 --> 21:30.386
Yeah?

21:31.745 --> 21:32.993
Made it up.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.658
Well, remember
my soccer trophy?

21:37.232 --> 21:39.107
Garage sale. $2.50.

21:40.827 --> 21:43.927
Oh, I'm glad to see you guys
worked everything on out.

21:43.962 --> 21:45.646
So are we.
Yeah, well

21:45.648 --> 21:46.908
I'm going to leave.

21:46.910 --> 21:47.822
Thanks for dinner.

21:47.857 --> 21:49.030
I got to go home and eat.

21:51.097 --> 21:52.256
Eddie, wait.

22:06.891 --> 22:09.216
I love this spot!
