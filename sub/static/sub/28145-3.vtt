WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:05.800
God almighty, I don't
know what the world's coming to.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.680
Bloody perverts.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.480
You're overreacting, Da.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.080
Overreacting? That lad's got no
trousers on, for Christ sake.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.280
He has a great set of pins on him,
doesn't he?

00:15.320 --> 00:18.000
For God's sake will you close that
window, we're foundered here.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.560
I need aired, Mary.
I've five layers on me.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.120
Five layers? What are you
trying to do? Change race?

00:24.160 --> 00:26.360
Give us a going over
with the hairdryer, will you?

00:26.400 --> 00:28.680
Indeed I will not. I've enough to be
at. Why do they keep

00:28.720 --> 00:31.160
touching themselves? Because they're
artists, Granda.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.600
Dirty English bastards is what they
are. No offence son.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.480
SDLP leader John Hume has again
called for

00:37.520 --> 00:38.960
cross party peace talks...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.920
John's really dying
for peace, like, isn't he?

00:41.960 --> 00:45.720
It's all he ever goes on about.
I hope it works out for him.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.360
Aye, I sort of hope it works
out for all of us, Sarah.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.600
Come on, girls, tome to hit the road
here. You've been

00:50.640 --> 00:53.000
roped into going too then, son?
Roped in? Hardly.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.280
He's riding Gary Barlow.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.360
I am not! I just respect him
as a songwriter, that's all.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.200
Aye, dead on, James, so you do.
Will we need our passports, Gerry?

01:00.240 --> 01:02.440
For Belfast? I don't think so, love.
Belfast! Are we not

01:02.480 --> 01:05.000
a wee bit early, Daddy? It's a two
hour drive with traffic, love.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.680
This thing's in Belfast?! But it's
eight hours till the doors open.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.280
Aye, we're cutting it fine all
right. Belfast! Sure, why don't you

01:10.320 --> 01:12.560
just sell the wains into white
slavery and be done with it?

01:12.600 --> 01:15.520
Gerry'll be with them, Da.
That's worse! Sure, they hate

01:15.560 --> 01:17.320
his kind there. My kind? Pricks.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.080
That is enough!
They're going to the concert, Da.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.800
- That's the end of the matter.
- And, finally, panic

01:22.840 --> 01:26.560
at Belfast Zoo today when a polar
bear escaped from its enclosure.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.280
The RUC have launched
a widespread search

01:29.320 --> 01:32.200
and have warned residents in
the local area to be extra vigilant.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.080
Now will you see sense? Aye, Granda,
cos an escaped polar bear's

01:35.120 --> 01:36.640
going to track us down and kill us.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.280
As if Mammy's bothered about that.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.160
Wise up, Mammy! As if a polar bear's
going to rock up

01:48.200 --> 01:51.440
at a Take That concert! He wouldn't
get a ticket, for a start.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.360
They sold out months ago.
You'd be surprised, girls.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.560
Aye, thon boys would get in where
draughts wouldn't.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.560
Sure, the concert's
nowhere near the zoo.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.560
But he's not in the zoo anymore,
is he, simple Simon?

02:01.600 --> 02:04.480
He's sauntering about Belfast
without a care in the world.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.000
Aye, keep up, Gerry. What I'm saying
is, it would be quite

02:07.040 --> 02:09.639
a lot of ground for him to cover.
They're quick on their feet

02:09.680 --> 02:12.280
when they want to be, love. Or
someone might give him a lift.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.480
Whose side are you on, Orla?
Come on, Mary.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.400
If you don't let Erin go, our Mas
won't let us go.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.160
Well, neither they should! And I'll
be ringing them to say as much.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.160
Brilliant! I hate my life.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.000
Look, girls, I know how much you
were all looking forward

02:24.040 --> 02:27.040
to seeing This n' That. TAKE That!
But there'll be other concerts.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.800
No, there won't! The fact that this
one's happening is a miracle.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.280
Nobody good ever comes here cos
we keep killing each other!

02:32.320 --> 02:34.840
And now we're overrun with
polar bears. Where will it end?

02:36.600 --> 02:39.360
Well, I'm not letting the fat,
furry fuck ruin

02:39.400 --> 02:41.920
the biggest day of my life.
What can we do?

02:43.280 --> 02:46.960
Listen, girls, I've never told
anyone this before but sometimes

02:47.000 --> 02:51.520
when Robbie's being interviewed,
it's like he's sending me messages

02:51.560 --> 02:55.560
through the TV, you know,
telepathically or whatever.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.400
It's like he's telling me
we're going to be together.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.720
Aye, maybe don't that to anyone
again, Michelle. Ever.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.480
Look, this is too important.
I'm going to that concert.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.720
I'm not afraid of a fucking polar
bear! Me either! Nor me. Bastard!

03:08.760 --> 03:11.840
I'll kill it with my own two hands
if I have to. Bring it on!

03:11.880 --> 03:15.280
OK, we seem to have
gone down a weird road here, people.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.920
I think we've got a bit confused.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.160
We don't have to fight a polar bear.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.720
And, if we did, I wouldn't really
fancy our chances

03:21.760 --> 03:24.280
because, well, they're massive.
But there's five of us so...

03:24.320 --> 03:26.560
The point is the polar bear's not
the one stopping us

03:26.600 --> 03:28.280
going to the concert.
It's our mothers.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.360
And we'll never get them
to change their minds.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.000
We're not gonna try to
change their minds.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.040
We're going to do something else.
What?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.360
Lie our holes off.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.200
We're going to get caught. I just
know it.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.480
We're not going to get caught,
Clare. Because, as far as

03:48.520 --> 03:50.960
our Mas are concerned, me, you and
James are at Erin's house,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.880
and Erin and Orla are round mine.
But we're not round yours, Michelle.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.320
We're on a bus to Belfast.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.400
I can't, I cannot explain it to her
again, I'm going to scream.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.440
What's in the suitcase, Michelle?
Vodka.

04:01.480 --> 04:05.320
You've brought an entire
suitcase full of vodka? No.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.880
There's some mixers as well.
I'm not a savage.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.960
You can mix vodka with cider, right?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.280
God I'm boiling. Is it any wonder,
Clare? What are you wearing?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.920
Yeah, you look like a fucking provo.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.760
I don't want anyone recognising me,
OK? Nobody's going to

04:17.800 --> 04:20.920
recognise you, Clare. Clare Devlin?
Is that you? Jesus Christ.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.960
Relax, Clare. It's the weekend.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.320
She has no authority over us
at the weekend.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.000
She has no right to question us,

04:27.040 --> 04:29.560
and, if she tries to,
I'll tell her as much.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.200
Morning, girls.
Morning, Sister Michael.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.720
What takes you to Belfast?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.680
I'm not really sure that's...
Speak up.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.120
I'm not really sure
that's any of your business.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.160
I'm going to assume that was an
ill-judged attempt

04:46.200 --> 04:48.320
at humour, Miss Quinn. Yes.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.360
Now answer the question.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.800
We're going to the museum.
Which museum? The Ulster museum.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.600
What for? A project, a history
project. What about?

04:55.640 --> 04:56.920
Ulster?

04:58.000 --> 05:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:16.480 --> 05:17.720
A history project!

05:17.760 --> 05:20.920
This web of lies we're spinning is
getting out of control now, girls.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.200
It's grand, Clare.
I think she bought it.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.000
Of course she didn't buy it.
She's onto us. I'm telling you.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.440
My God, I'm sweltered here.
Then take it off.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.160
I can't take it off. I've nothing
underneath it. What, not even a bra?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.320
Jesus, Clare! You've no bra on?
Of course I've got a bra on.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.040
I haven't got a bra on. Can everyone
please stop saying "bra."

05:37.080 --> 05:40.240
But I can hardly parade about in
just my bra. I'm not Madonna.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.480
Isn't that the truth.
What's she doing now?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.080
Reading her book.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.600
Now she's looking at the woman
beside her.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.160
Now she's getting up.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.920
Now she's coming this way.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.200
Now she's standing
right in front of us.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.520
What is he doing? Now she's asking
me. Stop talking, James.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.360
I want to sit here. What? Why?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.760
Well, you're just such wonderful
company, girls, what with

06:01.800 --> 06:04.080
your stimulating conversation
and your razor sharp wit.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.400
Really? No, not really. The woman
next to me is eating

06:06.440 --> 06:08.280
an egg and onion sandwich and the
smell of it

06:08.320 --> 06:09.760
is enough to turn an orange march.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.160
Christ, but this is heavy.
Sister, no, let me.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.800
What have you got in here, girls?
It's not ours!

06:14.840 --> 06:16.200
Not yours?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.560
We've never see it before in our
lives. Have we, girls?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.120
Never. Nope.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.760
Excuse me, everyone!
Can I have your attention, please?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.240
Does anyone own this red suitcase?

06:29.280 --> 06:31.040
No. Now, let me be clear,

06:31.080 --> 06:33.720
no-one can claim this bag,
is that correct?

06:33.760 --> 06:34.840
That's correct.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.080
I think we've got a code
red on our hands.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.920
Driver, pull over!

06:56.280 --> 06:58.840
In position.
Examining suspect device now.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.040
Sweet Jesus.
Aye, this isn't great.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.240
Ach, it's not that big a deal.
They're going to blow up

07:06.280 --> 07:08.600
an entire suitcase of vodka,
Michelle! I know, animals.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.440
Their wee beekeeper costumes
are so cracker.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.120
You're unbelievable!

07:13.160 --> 07:15.800
This is so itchy now! Don't blame
me! Blame the Milk Tray man.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.560
This is really serious, Michelle!
People have gone to jail for less.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.960
Why is this place so mental?
That's enough, James.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.320
You have serious fucking anger
management issues, do you know that.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.640
33 Bravo
this is 31 Alpha, over.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.400
I hear you. Over.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.240
All clear here. Over.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.080
Roger. Let's pack it up. Over.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.640
Powerful smell of vodka down here.
Over.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.880
Vodka, did he say?

07:45.920 --> 07:47.640
Interesting.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.240
OK, we need to go.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.320
We need a better plan, Michelle!
This is a great plan.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.920
We cannot walk to Belfast!
How far can it be?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.680
Have you ever seen Northern Ireland
on a map? It's fucking tiny.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.880
I have to say I'm not overly keen
on being out in the open like this.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.600
Just because of the whole
"There's a polar bear on the loose

08:13.640 --> 08:16.080
"that could maul us to death" thing!
It can try!

08:16.120 --> 08:18.320
Is it just me,
or is that Gypsy an absolute ride?

08:18.360 --> 08:21.400
Michelle! You cannot say that!
What? They're called Travellers now.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.680
You can't say Gypsy any more,
it's insulting. Is it?

08:24.720 --> 08:27.440
Yes. Yes, it is. Really?
Who are they?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.880
They're just people, James,
they're just people

08:29.920 --> 08:32.559
that are exactly like us.
Except different. Yes. No!

08:32.600 --> 08:35.360
That's actually racist, Orla.
No, it's not. They are different.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.600
They're not. They live in caravans,
for a start.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.760
I wish I lived in a caravan.
Me too. Caravan's are class.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.760
Could you all stop being
so racist, please?

08:42.799 --> 08:46.240
I'm a bit scared of them.
Is that racist? Yes.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.240
Very much so. Is "gypsy"
even a race? Traveller!

08:49.280 --> 08:52.560
How'ya, girls. Well, hello, there.
Hi. Good afternoon, Sir.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.880
"Sir?" What the fuck, Clare?
Hey! Hold on! What does he want?

08:55.920 --> 09:00.400
I dunno. I'm talking to you! Just
walk on. Hey! Are you deaf or what?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.680
Keep your heads down and keep
walking. Get back here!

09:02.720 --> 09:05.560
Faster, walk faster. Am I going to
have to come after ya, am I?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.760
Jesus Christ, he's following us.
Holy fuck! Run! What?

09:08.800 --> 09:11.320
He's obviously a psychopath! Run!

09:16.280 --> 09:20.400
He looks fucking raging. I don't
want to die! I don't want to die!

09:22.480 --> 09:25.040
This is some craic, isn't it? Holy
shit, they're fast!

09:25.080 --> 09:28.720
Get off! What? Back off, you heard
me, I'm not messing around

09:28.760 --> 09:32.120
with this thing. We mean you
no harm, Sir.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.440
Seriously, Clare, the "sir" thing,
just pack it in.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.000
Why are you being so weird?

09:36.040 --> 09:37.560
Why are you chasing us?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.080
Because you dropped this.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.120
That's my purse.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.840
Why did you think
we were chasing you?

09:43.880 --> 09:49.040
Right, I see, we're travellers
which means we're psychopaths?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.960
You were right, Erin. Shut up, Orla.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.480
We run after people and beat them
up for no fecking reason.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.400
No, look, that isn't.
We're travellers,

09:55.440 --> 09:58.480
so we're obviously violent.
No, not at all.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.400
Listen, we have huge respect
for you and your people.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.480
You've such a strong sense
of community

10:04.520 --> 10:06.640
and such wonderful,
traditional values.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.120
These lads bothering you, girls?
Yes, yes, they are.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.600
They're fucking madmen. They're
going to kill us. Help us, please!

10:16.680 --> 10:18.080
Jump in.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
Arseholes.

10:37.780 --> 10:38.780
We're totally set.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.900
Have you ever actually met them,
Rita? Take That?

10:42.940 --> 10:45.100
No, I can't stand them, if I'm being
honest,

10:45.140 --> 10:47.420
but their fans are so thick
they'll buy any old shite.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.860
Present company included.
I think you mean excluded.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.220
Naw. Naw, I don't.
I see.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.260
Pop music isn't really my thing,
truth be told.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.700
It's all so fucking soulless. Nah.
I'm a classical head, all the way,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.980
but I've been banned from trading
at Glyndebourne ever since

11:00.020 --> 11:02.020
I absolutely battered that
Pavarotti fan.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.380
And when I say I battered,
I mean intellectually, like.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.220
I did kick the shit
out of him as well!

11:06.620 --> 11:08.500
Pavo's La Boheme is very muscular,

11:08.540 --> 11:12.620
but for purity of tone you simply
cannot fault Bocelli.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.020
I mean, listen to that, girls.

11:14.060 --> 11:15.060
Pass us a can there.

11:16.820 --> 11:17.820
A can of?

11:18.940 --> 11:20.580
Beer. I see.

11:21.860 --> 11:22.980
Alcoholic beer.

11:25.940 --> 11:28.860
That's fucking beautiful.
While driving. OK. Fine. Good.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.860
I mean, what a fucking
instrument! Glorious!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.060
Any idea what the speed limit
is around here?

11:36.580 --> 11:40.300
"Robie!?" Close your eyes, girls,
and soak it up!

11:40.340 --> 11:42.140
Sure. Of course.

11:42.180 --> 11:44.820
But maybe you could soak it up with
your eyes open and,

11:44.860 --> 11:45.940
you know, on the road?

12:13.180 --> 12:16.740
Erin, what are we going to do?
I don't know! She's fucking mental!

12:16.780 --> 12:18.900
She's spelt Robbie wrong on every
single T-shirt! What?!

12:18.940 --> 12:20.620
How are we going to break it to her?

12:20.660 --> 12:23.780
That's what you're worried about,
Clare? At this very second?

12:23.820 --> 12:27.460
That's what's concerning you, a spelling
mistake? I find it disturbing, Erin.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.180
I tell you what, girls, I don't
believe in God but, see, if I did...

12:30.220 --> 12:32.980
She's lost the plot. ..that's what
he would sound like!

12:33.020 --> 12:35.660
We should have took our chances with
the Gypsies. Travellers!

12:38.620 --> 12:39.980
Jesus Christ!
What was that?

12:40.020 --> 12:41.100
Did we hit something?

12:42.460 --> 12:44.020
My God, it's the polar bear!

12:50.100 --> 12:52.700
Not again. Get it shifted, girls.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.620
This is rank.
Why are we doing it?

12:56.660 --> 12:59.057
Because Rita told us to and
I'm scared of her, Clare!

12:59.137 --> 13:00.380
I'm very, very scared of her!

13:00.420 --> 13:02.900
Why's it so heavy? Aren't
they meant to be 90% wool?

13:02.940 --> 13:05.340
Just put your back into it!
The sooner this is done,

13:05.380 --> 13:08.060
the sooner we're back in that van
and on our way to see Robbie.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.420
Robie! I mean, it
so obviously doesn't look right.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.620
I am not getting back in that
van, Michelle.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.420
The woman is a maniac.
We've come this far.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.580
We're not turning back

13:15.620 --> 13:16.940
Jesus Christ!

13:16.980 --> 13:19.140
What is it? I just put my hand
on its hole!

13:20.700 --> 13:23.460
Fuck this, let's just make James do
it, the lazy bastard.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.500
Totally. Good idea.

13:27.220 --> 13:28.220
Where is James?

13:35.980 --> 13:37.940
..he doesn't have any other
friends...

13:40.180 --> 13:41.500
Will you shut the fuck up?!

13:43.340 --> 13:45.800
OK. So, as far as I can make out,

13:45.840 --> 13:49.160
you think you left this James character
with the Gypsies? - Travellers.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.460
The small annoying one thinks we
should go back for him because..?

13:51.500 --> 13:54.340
They were so angry with us.
He could be in real danger, Rita.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.000
And the mouthy curly one thinks
we shouldn't because..?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.800
- He's a dickhead, Rita.
- See, it's tricky.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.340
Come on, Michelle! If we go back for
him we'll miss the start of the concert.

14:02.380 --> 14:05.660
But he's your cousin. Who hasn't
lost a cousin or two in their time?

14:05.700 --> 14:08.980
OK, OK, so who agrees with Tiny
Tears, who thinks we should go back?

14:10.860 --> 14:14.300
Orla! I like James, I like Take That
more.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.980
Make a fucking decision,
I've T shirts to flog!

14:17.020 --> 14:20.180
Come on, girls, it's Take That we're
talking about.

14:20.220 --> 14:21.220
I know, it's just...

14:21.260 --> 14:23.940
You said it yourself
Erin, the greats don't come here.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.180
We never got to see Bros,
New Kids on The Block

14:26.220 --> 14:27.740
Right Said Fred.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.500
Let's not add Take That to the list.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.820
We can't turn back. There's too much
at stake.

14:31.860 --> 14:33.300
James has the tickets.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.420
Despite John Hume's optimism
earlier today,

14:36.460 --> 14:37.900
the DUP leader, Ian Paisley,

14:37.940 --> 14:41.660
has said that under no circumstances
will his party sit at the same

14:41.700 --> 14:45.940
table as Sinn Fein,
making all party talks impossible.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.580
I can't take it any more.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.580
All these false promises.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.260
Waiting week after week,

14:51.300 --> 14:53.820
hoping today might be the day, only
to be disappointed.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.500
Don't upset yourself, love.
It's just a wheelie bin.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.980
It'll change my life, Gerry.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.180
And Strabane's had them
for months.

15:00.220 --> 15:03.820
I mean, what's going on there? Who's
pulling the strings for Strabane?

15:03.860 --> 15:06.300
I mean, it's against the
Trades Description Act.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.940
The label said mahogany.
Sure, that's barely oak.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.100
Jesus, but I'm fuming, so I am.

15:12.780 --> 15:13.980
He's gaining ground.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.100
What? The polar bear.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.900
Margo Murphy's niece just saw him

15:17.940 --> 15:20.580
outside the Abrakebabra
in Coleraine, apparently.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.060
That close?
I'll get the holy water.

15:22.100 --> 15:25.300
Sarah, buzz Michelle's mother there,
tell her we need our wains back.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.660
I will surely, Daddy.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.940
Then we'll barricade the front door,
and if worst comes to worst,

15:29.980 --> 15:32.780
Jim across the road lent me his
tranquiliser gun. Nobody's picking up.

15:32.820 --> 15:35.460
Why does Jim across the road have a
tranquilizer gun?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.180
His brother had an awful lot of
bother with devil worshippers.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.980
Excuse me? Aye, they sent up camp on
his farm and he couldn't shift them

15:42.020 --> 15:44.620
for love nor money, so Jim bought
a couple of guns and just...

15:44.660 --> 15:47.180
What? Shot them?
Aye. I think it worked, you know?

15:47.220 --> 15:48.460
I imagine it would, yeah.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.020
I'm not convinced they were devil
worshippers, you know?

15:51.060 --> 15:52.900
Sure their hair had never seen a
brush

15:52.940 --> 15:54.980
and they were head to toe in
tie dye, Mary.

15:55.420 --> 16:00.380
Jesus Christ! OK, I think
we all just need to take a moment.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.180
Don't answer!

16:03.420 --> 16:05.340
That might be him!
That might be the polar bear!

16:05.380 --> 16:08.060
Yeah, because they're known
for their impeccable manners.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.405
They might come into your
house and rip your throat out,

16:10.485 --> 16:11.900
but they'll knock
on the door first.

16:11.940 --> 16:14.380
Could you please stop pointing that
thing at me, Joe?

16:14.420 --> 16:15.420
Da...

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
Och, Geraldine.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.460
I hope you don't mind,
your front door was open.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.100
Can you believe this
bloody polar bear?

16:23.140 --> 16:25.940
We're at our wits end over at our
place. It's desperate, so it is.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
Mary? Gerry?

16:28.420 --> 16:29.980
'mon in Deidre love, it's open.

16:30.220 --> 16:31.700
Can you credit this arsehole?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.780
He's going to hold this whole town
hostage, you mark my words.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.060
He's an evil bastard, Deidre.

16:36.100 --> 16:39.340
Look, I just want to get my two back
home if that's all right, Mary.

16:39.380 --> 16:42.140
Aye, same here. You wouldn't mind
getting Clare for me?

16:42.180 --> 16:43.980
What are you talking about?
Ssh! Listen.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.460
A polar bear that
escaped from Belfast Zoo

16:46.500 --> 16:48.220
this morning has been recaptured.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.860
A group of firefighters who were
helping with the search

16:50.900 --> 16:53.860
discovered the animal
close to the A6 between

16:53.900 --> 16:57.420
Belfast and Londonderry,
feasting on a sheep carcass.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.460
Thank God for that.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.380
I better leave Jim's gun back,
so.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.500
Michelle, James and Clare, did they
tell you they were coming round here?

17:06.540 --> 17:07.540
Aye. That's right.

17:08.700 --> 17:09.700
The wee feckers!

17:33.180 --> 17:35.260
What are you playing at?
Get in the van, fucko!

17:35.300 --> 17:37.940
Does not have to if you
don't want to, James.

17:37.980 --> 17:40.460
With all due respect,
this has got nothing to do with you.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.460
The way you treat this fella is
disgraceful.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.380
What's going on, James?

17:46.420 --> 17:49.060
Jonjo and the lads,
well, they just get me,

17:49.100 --> 17:52.020
and it turns out I'm a really
good salesman.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.580
He's a natural.

17:53.620 --> 17:55.380
So what? You're a Gypsy now?
Traveller!

17:55.420 --> 17:57.580
Actually, Gypsy's fine.
I knew it!

17:57.620 --> 17:58.860
Let's get a move on!

17:58.980 --> 18:00.460
Right, get in the van. Come on.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.380
And do not test me, cos we've
already missed PJ and Duncan.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.420
Is that who was supporting them?
Aye. Aw, I really like them!

18:06.460 --> 18:09.100
I'm not leaving, Michelle.
Not even for Gary Barlow?

18:09.660 --> 18:12.100
I don't really rate him
as a songwriter, you know?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.940
I'm sorry, Jonjo,

18:17.980 --> 18:19.940
but you've just crossed
the line there.

18:22.420 --> 18:29.260
"Sure"
by Take That

18:31.100 --> 18:33.380
My Michelle's going to be wishing
she was mauled to death

18:33.420 --> 18:34.980
by that thing when I get my hands on
her.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.580
I don't know what to do any more.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.060
I mean, they say that all
teenagers are a bit rebellious

18:40.100 --> 18:42.460
but Clare's off the scale.
She's basically a delinquent.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.500
Have you considered adoption,
Geraldine?

18:44.540 --> 18:47.780
She's 16, Sarah.
Sure, she's past the cut-off.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.260
And finally, amazing scenes in
The King's Hall this evening

18:51.300 --> 18:53.260
as the British pop sensations
Take That

18:53.300 --> 18:55.620
play their first ever
Northern Irish concert.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.260
Look, girls, we just need some cold,
hard proof

19:03.300 --> 19:04.620
they went to that concert.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.780
And then, by Christ, they won't know
what's hit them.
