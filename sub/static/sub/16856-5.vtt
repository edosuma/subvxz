What?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.664
The way you get people
to <i> do things</i> for you.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.733
I don't know what you're
talking about, chief.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.468
I mean, people
just do things for me

00:36.470 --> 00:37.803
Because of
my beautiful hair

And my flawless skin
and my perfect melons.

There's more to it
than that.

with the way you pout.
