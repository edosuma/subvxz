00:01.069 --> 00:02.836
Ain't no fun

00:03.671 --> 00:04.772
(siren wails)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.342
-(barks)
-(motor revs)

00:08.376 --> 00:10.744
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.

00:12.946 --> 00:16.084

00:30.231 --> 00:32.233
(dog barking in distance)

00:34.034 --> 00:36.036
(children's playful shouts
in distance)

00:53.887 --> 00:55.556
(door opens)

00:58.726 --> 00:59.860
(door closes)

00:59.893 --> 01:01.595
How's it look?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.030
Eh.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.433
Cameras everywhere.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.067
Yeah, right.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.702
Big gates.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.471
Not good.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.210
(groans)

01:16.244 --> 01:17.845
(exhales):
Oh...

01:20.848 --> 01:23.684
Ah, well, we've got plenty
of pistachios.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.825
-RAY: Connery. Yeah.
-GARY: Yeah. Totally.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.361
Second?

01:35.963 --> 01:37.265
Lazenby.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.933
-Lazenby?
-Yeah.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.969
Who the fuck's that?

01:42.002 --> 01:43.671
George Lazenby.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.038
No, never heard of him.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.176
After Connery.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.643
He did, um,

01:49.677 --> 01:51.679
Her Majesty's,
uh, Secret Service.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.281
-Mm-hmm?
-Only did one film.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.283
Never seen it.
I'll have to see it.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.784
Yeah, it's good.
Yeah, right.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.252
He's an Aussie.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.787
-An Aussie?
-Mm-hmm.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.589
-Bond?
-Aussie Bond, mate.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.956
-Fuck off.
-Yeah, serious.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.458
That's not right--
you can't have an Aussie Bond.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.759
No, he's Aussie.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.994
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.096
-Yeah, right.
-Mm-hmm.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.299
-Okay. So that's two.
-Yeah.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.267
What about number three?

02:13.301 --> 02:15.336
I don't mind the guy
playing him now.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.137
Mm-hmm.
What's his name?

02:19.707 --> 02:22.075
What's his fucking name?

02:25.145 --> 02:26.714
Yeah, I don't know.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.282
Yeah.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.950
-He's number three, though.
-Yeah, he's three.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.452
Right-o. Number four?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.387
Four...

02:33.421 --> 02:35.223
I didn't like Moore.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.491
-Don't like the old Roger?
-No.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.493
-Nah?
-Nah, too snobby,

02:39.527 --> 02:40.661
-Really?
-polished, yeah.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.129
-Yeah?
-I didn't like him.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.997
I like the old Roger.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.300
-Yeah, no, I didn't like him.
-Okay.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.901
What about Brosnan?

02:47.935 --> 02:49.703
No.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.838
No, I put Brosnan last.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.005
-Don't like Brosnan?
-Last.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.006
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.675
Yeah, all right.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.809
Yeah, no, I'd go:

02:55.843 --> 02:57.511
Connery, Lazenby,

02:57.545 --> 02:59.146
guy playing him now...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.215
-Mm-hmm.
-um, Dalton,

03:01.249 --> 03:03.351
Moore...

03:03.384 --> 03:04.685
-Brosnan.
-All right.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.855
I got: Connery...

03:07.888 --> 03:09.723
Moore, Brosnan,

03:09.757 --> 03:12.059
-guy playing him now...
-Mm-hmm.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.094
-Dalton.
-Don't like him.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.567
All right.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.035
Best Batman.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.371
Oh.
(scoffs)

03:23.404 --> 03:25.205
-Keaton.
-Keaton. Yeah.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.042
(whispers):
"I'm Batman."

03:29.076 --> 03:30.544
(engine starts)

03:31.979 --> 03:33.981
H... Here we are.
(grunts)

03:38.919 --> 03:40.220
(grunts softly)

03:47.761 --> 03:48.996
(engine starts)

04:14.788 --> 04:17.224
GARY (whispers):
Okay.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
Pull in there.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.267
(engine stops)

04:34.642 --> 04:36.777
GARY:
Which one's the prez?

04:36.810 --> 04:39.279
RAY:
Guy in the light-colored jacket.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.950
And the VP?

04:42.983 --> 04:46.153
That guy he's hugging now--
the bald head.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.288
GARY:
Yeah, right.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.358
(Gary groans)

04:50.391 --> 04:52.693
It's fucking Daniel Craig.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.629
RAY:
Ah. That's it.

04:55.663 --> 04:58.399
Ugh.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.005
(excited shouts)

05:05.038 --> 05:06.707
Put the thingy on! Put the...

05:06.740 --> 05:07.875
Aah!

05:07.908 --> 05:09.710
Aah!
(laughing)

05:09.743 --> 05:11.211
Go left!

05:12.413 --> 05:14.382
-(laughing)
-RAY: Yeah!

05:14.415 --> 05:15.883
BRITTANY:
Oh!

05:19.019 --> 05:20.320
ALLY: (chuckles)
All right, last one.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.622
You need to get this one.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.623
-Yeah?
-Last one.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.657
-All right.
-Ready?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.325
Start praying.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.898
He's good.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.633
What do you want?

05:32.666 --> 05:34.568
-Uh, that one, please.
-No worries.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.805
-There you go.
-(Ally chuckles)

05:37.838 --> 05:39.840
-Happy?
-Yeah.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.980
ALLY:
What are we doing
for Christmas?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.016
RAY:
What do you want to do?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.884
ALLY:
Well, my family

05:50.918 --> 05:54.321
are going to my folks
for lunch...

05:54.354 --> 05:55.756
-Yeah.
-and I was wondering

05:55.789 --> 05:58.526
if you and Bruce and Britt...

05:58.559 --> 06:00.594
wanted to come.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.596
Yeah, I'll ask Brucey.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.633
But Britt and I
will definitely come.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.136
Okay.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.272
-Girls, you want an ice cream?
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

06:12.305 --> 06:14.007
-ALLY: Yes.
-RAY: Yeah, that's a surprise.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.444
-MAN: Let me get
a scoop of chocolate.
-SERVER: Right.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.778
MAN:
Two scoops. Why not? Fill it up.

06:17.811 --> 06:18.946
-WOMAN: Two?
-MAN: Yeah.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.115
SERVER:
And there you go.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.685
Thank you.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.854
-Uh, excuse me?
-Yeah?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.355
I asked for two scoops.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.957
Oh, yeah,
there's two scoops there.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.059
How come they're
the same size, then?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.527
-See?
-(Ray clears throat)

06:33.561 --> 06:35.295
Well, there's one scoop
in this cup, right?

06:35.328 --> 06:37.064
-Yeah.
-And two scoops in this cup?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.932
-Yeah.
-So how come they're
the same size, then?

06:38.966 --> 06:41.702
-Oh. No, sorry, I...
-There-There's as much
in this one as this one.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.637
Right, I pushed
the two scoops down more

06:43.671 --> 06:46.574
so that they'd both
fit into the cup.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.642
-Just don't worry about it.
-What? It's a fucking rip-off.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.143
I put the same-size scoops
in there.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.712
You put
the same-size scoops in there?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.281
-Yes.
-I don't fucking think so, mate.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.049
-Look.
-(Ray groans)

06:56.083 --> 06:58.118
Scoops. Same height.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.720
SERVER:
Mm-hmm.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.455
Yeah, um, like I was saying,
I pushed it down, so...

07:01.489 --> 07:02.723
Two scoops. Yeah, yeah.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.558
-One still should be bigger.
-Mm-hmm.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.259
If you're n...
if you're not happy...

07:06.293 --> 07:07.628
-Give me two scoops.
-Okay.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.262
Fucking wrong with this guy.

07:09.296 --> 07:13.066
-Deaf or something.
-I'm really sorry about that.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.468
There's another scoop.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.003
All right, that's better.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.973
You get what I mean, right,
about the scoops?

07:20.007 --> 07:22.610
Oh, yeah, totally.
It's completely fine.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.411
-Yeah, all good.
-Mm-hmm.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.547
All right, let's go.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.284
You got a problem, mate?

07:31.318 --> 07:33.754
Yeah, mate.
Would you like one, would you?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.255
Well, come on.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.591
-Let's go.
-ALLY: Ray.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.259
-MAN: Huh?
-ALLY: It's not worth it.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.794
-Well, come on.
-MAN: Eh...

07:40.828 --> 07:43.531
Yeah, that's
what I thought. Fag.

07:44.532 --> 07:47.134
Uh, what do you want, girls?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.269
-What flavor?
-Eh? What do you want?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.138
-Uh...
-I want salted caramel.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.973
-Salted caramel?
-Yeah.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.374
I want mint choc chip.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.309
-Mint choc-- that's my favorite.
-Yeah.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.211
-How many scoops you want?
-Have a good night.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
(slap in distance)

08:07.054 --> 08:09.322
(slap)

08:10.357 --> 08:12.225
(slap)

08:12.259 --> 08:14.161
Dad?

08:14.194 --> 08:16.697
-Oh. God. Oh! Sorry, it's...
-Don't hit Ally!

08:16.730 --> 08:18.498
No, darling, it's okay.
It's okay. It's, um...

08:18.532 --> 08:19.967
-We're okay. We're just...
-Why were you hitting her?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.702
-No, no, no, no. It's okay.
-I... I wasn't hitting.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.004
-No...
-I wasn't. I wasn't. No,
we're just mucking around, love.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.739
-ALLY: Um...
-Just-just... just mucking
around, just playful.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.207
-And it's all right.
-What were you doing?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.377
Um...

08:30.410 --> 08:32.145
We were having sex.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.447
Oh, Jesus.

08:35.716 --> 08:39.086
Um, has Mum had the birds and
the bees chat with you, love?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.588
-What?
-The sex talk.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.723
-Has Mum talked
to you about sex?
-No.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.391
Okay. Well, we...
We'll... we'll...

08:44.424 --> 08:46.026
We'll have a talk
about it, okay?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.394
Why don't you just go
to your room, and we'll...?

08:47.427 --> 08:49.429
I'll come in
in a minute, all right?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.532
Just give us a minute.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.504
-(laughing)
-Ah, man. Mm.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.106
Jesus Christ.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.941
Fucking heart attack.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.944
(laughs)
Oh...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.949
Okay. So...

09:10.651 --> 09:12.920
When a man and a woman
love each other,

09:12.953 --> 09:15.455
all right, they have sex.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.457
Okay?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.959
So, um...

09:20.728 --> 09:22.029
...when they have sex,

09:22.062 --> 09:25.298
the man puts his penis...

09:25.332 --> 09:27.034
-You know what a penis is?
-Dad.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.468
Okay.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.638
So, the man takes his penis,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.205
and he puts it

09:32.239 --> 09:34.742
inside the woman's vagina.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.877
What? Why?

09:36.910 --> 09:39.379
Well, 'cause that's how
you make a baby.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.449
So, do you know what, um...

09:42.482 --> 09:44.417
do you know what testicles are?

09:44.451 --> 09:46.553
-Balls?
-ALLY: Mm.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.790
Balls, yeah. Okay.
So, in the man's balls,

09:49.823 --> 09:51.992
there's things called sperm.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.593
-Okay?
-Okay.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.664
And they're kind of like,
um, like little fish.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.632
-Fish?
-Mm.
-ALLY: No.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.233
Nah, they're more like,
um, tadpoles.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.770
You've got tadpoles
in your balls?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.473
(grunts softly)

10:08.809 --> 10:11.578
They're kind of like tadpoles,
but they're smaller.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.446
-ALLY: Mm.
-Okay?

10:13.480 --> 10:17.084
So, anyway, when the man
and the woman have sex, right,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.587
the sperm--
the little tadpoles--

10:20.620 --> 10:23.490
swim out of the man's penis,
right,

10:23.523 --> 10:26.660
and go into the woman's vagina.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.597
And then they swim

10:30.630 --> 10:32.700
up into...

10:32.733 --> 10:35.002
the woman's... tummy.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.604
Mm. There's an egg.
Where there's an egg there.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
-An egg?
-Yeah. No, it's...

10:39.673 --> 10:41.608
it's not a... it's not
a hard egg. It's not like...

10:41.641 --> 10:43.443
Not like a chicken egg.
It's-it's a soft egg.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.511
And there's, like,

10:44.544 --> 10:47.715
millions of these sperm, okay?

10:47.748 --> 10:50.818
So, the sperm
that swims the fastest

10:50.851 --> 10:52.652
out of all those
millions, right,

10:52.686 --> 10:54.955
is the first one
that gets to the egg,

10:54.988 --> 10:57.825
and that's the one
that makes the baby.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.061
So, when you were a sperm,
you swam the fastest.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.063
So, if I was the fastest sperm,

11:03.096 --> 11:05.232
how come I'm not
a good swimmer now?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.369
Um...

11:09.402 --> 11:10.738
-Well...
-Wait. So, hang on.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.372
I came from your balls?

11:14.441 --> 11:16.243
Half of you came from my balls.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.045
Half-half of you came
from my balls,

11:18.078 --> 11:20.047
and the other half came
from your mum's tummy.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.716
-That's weird.
-Mm.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.152
So, are you gonna
make a sister for me?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.855
Uh, no,
we're not planning to. No.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.757
Why are you doing sex, then?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.596
(both chuckle softly)

11:37.697 --> 11:40.433
Um... 'cause it feels nice.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.069
Gross!

11:42.102 --> 11:44.371
ALLY:
It's not that bad.
It's a bit gross.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.424
(grunts)

12:12.399 --> 12:15.002
(engine starts)

12:35.422 --> 12:37.324
* Lights out... *

12:37.357 --> 12:38.926
How you going, love?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.794
G'day.
What can I do you for?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.595
Just a couple of dimmies.
Thanks, love.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.631
Okay.

12:46.699 --> 12:48.335
So, how's your day going?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.103
RAY:
It's all right.
How's yours?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.805
Oh, you know.
Same old, same old.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.141
-Yeah.
-Boring.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.609
There you go.
That's $6.80, thanks.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.145
Keep the change,
love, all right?

12:58.178 --> 12:59.913
Aw, thanks.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.615
* Together we'll get through *

13:02.649 --> 13:04.852
* I don't have the time... *

13:04.885 --> 13:07.754
(loud, distant chatter)

13:07.787 --> 13:11.658
* I promise, baby, you *

13:11.691 --> 13:14.161
* Hold on to me tight *

13:14.194 --> 13:16.629
* I'm hanging by your side... *

13:16.663 --> 13:17.998
Here we go.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.432
Hey, Steph. How are you, doll?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.834
-G'day. Not bad. You?
-Good.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.269
-Good.
-I'm doing good, love.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.138
-You want a drink, mate?
-Yeah, a lemon i...

13:25.172 --> 13:27.107
lemon iced tea, man.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.141
Ray?

13:29.509 --> 13:30.777
How are you, mate?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.645
I don't believe it.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.281
-Ray Shoesmith.
-Yeah.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.682
How you been?
All right?

13:35.715 --> 13:37.284
Jesus.
I'm real good, mate.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.852
Geez, it's good to... Oh.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.488
-Mate, it's good to see you.
-Yeah. Same, Vinnie.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.023
-No, really. Seriously.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.391
-Fucking good to see you.
-Yeah, same, mate. Yeah.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.159
What the...? You-you live
around here, do you?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.827
-Yeah, just about ten minutes
down the road.
-Nice, nice.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.329
-You around here, too, eh?
Yeah, yeah.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.531
-Hey, listen, uh, Pauly, mate.
-Yeah.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.500
Yeah. I was real sorry
to hear about Pauly.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.567
-Oh, yeah.
-I was real sorry to hear

13:54.601 --> 13:55.802
-about that, mate.
-Yeah. Thanks, mate.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.404
Now, I would've come
to the funeral, I was overseas.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.306
-Yeah, no, it's all right.
-He was a good bloke, but...

13:59.339 --> 14:01.008
-Thank you. Yeah. Great bloke.
-Yeah, sorry.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.842
-Yeah. yeah.
-Yeah. Anyway,
so what you got there?

14:02.876 --> 14:05.178
-What you...? Dimmies.
-Dimmies, mate.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.579
-Yeah.
-Ah, can't go past
the dimmies, mate.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.847
-Surely can't.
-Hey. Hey, listen.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.316
Have you tried
the sausage rolls?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.551
-Uh, no. No, I haven't.
-Oh, fuck. Hey, Steph.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.154
Old mate here-- he's never tried
one of your sausage rolls.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.555
-Coming right up, Vinnie.
-I'll pay for it. Yeah?

14:15.588 --> 14:16.823
-Yeah.
-All right. I...

14:16.856 --> 14:18.425
It might sound like
I'm carrying on,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.027
but seriously, she makes them
fresh here every day.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.528
They're the best sausage rolls
in the country, I swear to God.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.330
-Oh, yeah?
-Put that down there...

14:23.363 --> 14:25.332
-I'll give it a crack, mate.
I got to run.
-All right.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.067
-Yeah, I'm late already.
Good to see you.
-Ah.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.501
-Real good. Real good.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.770
-You look good.
-You, too. You haven't aged.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.772
-Yeah. Look after yourself.
-Well, yeah.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.142
-It's real good
to see you, mate.
-Talk to you soon.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.448
Now, some of those numbers
aren't gonna add up exactly,

14:41.481 --> 14:42.849
-but I think...
-Some of 'em?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.251
-You know what to do.
-Yeah.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.685
-Some of 'em. Couple of 'em.
-Yeah.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.054
Couple of 'em. Hi, mate.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.855
-You all right?
-Yeah, good.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.790
-You sticking around for a bit?
-Yeah.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.792
I want to talk to you
about something, you know.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.727
-All right.
-How you doing, man?

14:54.761 --> 14:56.196
-Yeah.
-Ray.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.698
-Nasir.
-We got to have a chat,
all right?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.067
I'll catch you later.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.468
-Is that the guy?
-No, mate. Come on.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.869
-Is that the guy?
-Let's go.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.404
Answer me!

15:06.306 --> 15:08.708
I'm gonna teach you about loss.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.776
Excuse me?

15:09.809 --> 15:11.544
-Get to work, please now.
-I know your face now.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.180
-Get to work, Ray!
-Gonna teach you about loss!

15:25.858 --> 15:27.961
-(sighs)
-Davros' brother, was it?

15:27.995 --> 15:30.263
Why the fuck would you
bring him in here?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.965
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.235
Hey, listen, um,
that shit he said--

15:35.268 --> 15:36.903
don't worry about that.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.606
He's just...
he's just upset, you know?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.012
Is he a crim?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.014
No. No, he's an accountant.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.782
He's been helping me
with the books.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.961
(dance music playing)

16:05.965 --> 16:08.635
-Yeah.
-I can't even remember

16:08.668 --> 16:10.203
the last time I got laid.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.039
How long's it been?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.174
Oh, shit.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.608
Year and a half, maybe.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.943
Mm.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.211
Well,

16:18.245 --> 16:19.812
I could, uh,

16:19.846 --> 16:21.848
organize something for you,
if you want.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.850
I hate knock shops.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.185
No, I'd just get one
of the girls from work

16:25.218 --> 16:27.354
to come pay you a visit.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.688
BRUCE:
Mm.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.956
Maybe.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.991
Mm.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.364
Can I ask you something?

16:37.397 --> 16:39.532
Yeah.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.371
When I don't feel like doing
any of this anymore,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.339
will you help me?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.977
Help you with what?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.646
You know...

16:53.680 --> 16:56.249
call it quits.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.020
Die?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.456
Yeah.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.166
Cross that bridge
when we come to it, mate, eh?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.602
Yeah, okay.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.074
RAY:
You know, Britt'd miss you.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.844
Yeah, I know.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.014
I'd probably miss you
for about five minutes.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.849
(Bruce chuckles softly)

17:29.882 --> 17:32.285
(birds calling)

17:33.320 --> 17:35.722
You know, you guys
are the only reason

17:35.755 --> 17:38.658
I've stuck around
as long as I have.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
Mm.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
(Bruce chuckles softly)

17:50.270 --> 17:52.272
(knocking)

17:53.406 --> 17:56.209
(water running)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.478
(water stops)

18:08.621 --> 18:10.990
Ray. How are you?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.759
How come you didn't come
to the club?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.327
Yeah, sorry.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.963
Totally forgot.
My fault.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.500
So, you gonna invite me in
or...?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.802
Yeah, 'course.
Come in, come in.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.274
So, what's been happening?

18:27.307 --> 18:28.908
Oh, not much.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.510
What's been happening with you?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.845
Oh, mate, heaps, actually.
Yeah.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.081
I, um, had an audition
for a pilot yesterday.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.484
So, pretty stoked about that.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.252
-Like a TV show?
-Yeah.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.987
Oh.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.657
Yeah. It's, uh...

18:44.691 --> 18:46.826
You here for the dough?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.595
No, just thought I'd come around

18:48.628 --> 18:50.163
and see how your acting career
is going.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.931
(laughs)
Yeah.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.235
Uh, mate, I'm gonna have
to get that to you on Wednesday.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.837
Said you'd have the money, man.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.306
No, I know.
I know I did.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.374
And I'm sorry,
but I'm definitely gonna have it

19:01.408 --> 19:02.809
by Wednesday.
Definitely.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.677
(continues playing ukulele)

19:05.712 --> 19:08.147
I have to give you a touch-up.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.851
What? But Wednesday's
two days away.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.786
Yeah, I know when Wednesday is.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.455
(playing ukulele)

19:15.488 --> 19:16.789
Okay.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.191
Um...

19:18.225 --> 19:20.327
well, could it not be the face?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.394
It's got to be the face.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.729
Why?

19:22.762 --> 19:25.064
It's got to be somewhere
where people can see it.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.165
Why?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.367
So, if Freddy sees you,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.369
he knows I've done my job.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.804
(playing ukulele)

19:31.838 --> 19:33.373
Okay.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.574
Cool?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.209
-Yep.
-All right.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.177
Cool. All right.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.179
Don't-don't use my uke, please.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.081
My nan gave me that.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.151
(sighs)

19:45.184 --> 19:46.653
Happy?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.588
-Yeah.
-Cool.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.857
-Don't flinch, all right?
-(door closes)

19:50.890 --> 19:52.091
-(hammer cocks)
-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.193
Mate, mate, it's just my mum.
It's just my mum, okay?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.862
-Please. Pl...
-Why didn't you fucking
say something?

19:55.895 --> 19:58.231
She's staying with me
for a couple days.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.399
Please?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.836
Hello.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.204
How you doing?

20:05.238 --> 20:06.606
Mum, this is Ray.
He's a mate of mine.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.040
Hi. I'm Lorraine.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.942
Nice to meet you.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.944
Well, I'm gonna make a cuppa.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.446
Would you boys like one?

20:13.480 --> 20:16.048
Um...

20:16.082 --> 20:17.284
Yeah.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.952
Thanks, love.

20:19.986 --> 20:20.953
(cupboard door creaks open)

20:20.987 --> 20:22.555
(clinking)

20:22.589 --> 20:23.990
Mm-mmm.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.229
So, what do you do, Ray?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.731
Security, mainly.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.566
-Oh.
-Mm.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.268
So, you're just here
for a couple of days,

20:35.302 --> 20:36.903
-are you?
-Yes.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.138
I'm actually living
in Broken Hill at the moment.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.740
Been there a few years now.

20:40.773 --> 20:41.808
Oh, okay. Yeah.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.075
I went through there
a few years ago.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.076
Nice, uh...

20:44.110 --> 20:45.912
It's got a good feel to it.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.547
Yeah, it's nice.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.216
It's got a real community feel
about it, which I like.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.951
Yeah, well, you don't get much
of that around here, do you?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.219
No, you don't.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.423
-Mm.
-I lived in St Kilda
for many years,

20:56.456 --> 20:58.658
and there's very little
community spirit there,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.493
-I can tell you.
-Mm.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.662
Mm.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.432
Mm. We better get going.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.634
Oh, shit. Yeah.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.837
Um, we got to pick up my sister
from work, so...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.341
Actually, Mum,

21:14.374 --> 21:17.243
um, me and Ray--

21:17.276 --> 21:20.246
we've got to r-rehearse
for an audition I've got.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.981
-Oh, another one?
-Yeah.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.250
So... is that all right?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.985
Yeah. That's fine.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.420
I'll take my car.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.022
-JASON: Great.
-Oh. I'll get that door
for you, love.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.159
Nice to meet you.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.260
Nice to meet you, Ray.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.328
Okay.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.631
Oh, and... break a leg.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.900
I will. Thanks.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.271
Just-just not the teeth.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.306
Hey? I've just spent
eight grand on veneers.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.709
-Anything else?
-(sighs) No, that's it.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.945
Oh! Oh!

21:52.979 --> 21:54.447
Oh... I've got it!

21:54.481 --> 21:56.449
I've got it!
I've got the fucking money.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.017
(whimpers):
I've got it.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.285
Fuck!

21:59.318 --> 22:00.920

22:01.921 --> 22:04.491
(groaning)

22:04.524 --> 22:06.926
(panting, groaning)

22:17.504 --> 22:18.971
Why didn't you just give me
the fucking money

22:19.005 --> 22:20.373
when I asked for it?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.244
I'm going to L.A.
for pilot season.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.148
No, you're not.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.249
No, no, no, no, no, no!

much to say *

23:05.084 --> 23:08.120

they just want to take you *

23:08.154 --> 23:11.190

want to make you *

23:11.223 --> 23:15.127

23:34.346 --> 23:35.748

the money, man.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.250
No, I know I did.
I'm definitely gonna
have it by Wednesday.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.285
Definitely.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.755
I'm gonna have to
give you a touch-up.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.124
What? Well, can it
not be the face?

23:45.157 --> 23:46.893
-It's gotta be the face.
-Why?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.828
It's gotta be somewhere
where people can see it.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.397
-Now, don't flinch, yeah?
-WOMAN: Jason?

23:51.430 --> 23:54.133
Whoa, whoa. Mate, mate.
It's just my mum.

-Hi. I'm Lorraine.

-There's nothing to talk about.

-What we did was personal.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.184
We broke the rules.

I... know... more.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.068
I think I'd make
a great drag queen.
Like, for real.

25:02.101 --> 25:05.805
But the one time I tried it,
I looked so much like my mom,
it scared me.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.473
And I was sexy as hell.
