<i>They don't look like</i> <i>volunteers to me.</i>

00:03.087 --> 00:04.870
Millions of people are dying for no reason.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.071
These men are gonna die
to help us find a vaccine.

00:07.106 --> 00:09.374
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i> <i>No, no, no, no!</i>

00:13.879 --> 00:14.813
Those are zombie bites.

00:14.847 --> 00:15.513
Eight of them.

00:16.230 --> 00:17.831
If we can get him to the lab in California,

00:17.865 --> 00:20.100
they can use his blood and
make more of the vaccine.

00:20.735 --> 00:24.571
They will not attack me
because they love and fear me.

00:25.639 --> 00:26.773
I'm your messiah.

00:26.974 --> 00:27.674
Jesus.

00:27.708 --> 00:29.976
No, just Murphy.

01:09.216 --> 01:10.650
How old?

01:10.684 --> 01:11.651
Five months.

01:11.685 --> 01:13.853
He has his whole life ahead of him.

01:13.888 --> 01:16.556
Well hopefully he's got a nap ahead of him.

01:16.590 --> 01:17.423
They're important.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.259
Yeah, I wish he understood that.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.628
He doesn't want to miss anything.

01:23.330 --> 01:24.397
Have a great day.

01:24.431 --> 01:26.266
You too, my dear. And you.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.102
Have a good life, young man.
Make us all proud of you.

01:32.740 --> 01:33.840
You're the doctor?

01:33.874 --> 01:34.707
That's right.

01:34.742 --> 01:36.075
Cool. I'm Johnny.

01:36.110 --> 01:38.812
It's about ten blocks away.
You want to cab it?

01:38.846 --> 01:40.480
It's a beautiful day.

01:40.514 --> 01:42.415
Let's take a walk.

01:53.127 --> 01:56.229
Had a buddy down there
last week when Sandy hit.

01:56.263 --> 01:59.265
Had to pay a cabbie two grand
to get a ride out of town.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.801
He said it was bananas, lawless.

02:01.836 --> 02:04.504
Doesn't take much to get
people acting like savages.

02:04.538 --> 02:06.472
Just take their food away.

02:06.507 --> 02:07.907
That's it, brotha.

02:07.942 --> 02:09.776
Man eat man.

02:21.088 --> 02:22.422
That's Bill.

02:23.190 --> 02:25.391
Just can't kick the crock.

02:25.426 --> 02:27.360
Shit's nasty.

02:29.663 --> 02:30.396
Sweet.

02:35.336 --> 02:37.871
I'm going to ask you a few questions, Bill.

02:38.572 --> 02:41.307
When was your last meal?

02:41.675 --> 02:42.709
I don't no.

02:43.711 --> 02:44.611
A week maybe.

02:45.679 --> 02:48.081
Have you noticed an increased
sensitivity to light?

02:48.115 --> 02:49.115
Uh huh.

02:49.149 --> 02:50.950
Numbness in your extremities?

02:57.524 --> 02:58.458
Are you cold?

03:00.461 --> 03:01.294
Freezing.

03:09.370 --> 03:11.237
Are you gonna help me?

03:11.739 --> 03:13.006
Actually

03:16.477 --> 03:18.077
you're going to help me.

03:58.786 --> 04:01.020
Not sure how much longer
we can hold it together.

04:01.221 --> 04:03.356
It's only another 150 miles.

04:03.590 --> 04:05.258
We have a man down, Cassandra.

04:05.292 --> 04:07.093
She's not looking good.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.461
And then there's the package.

04:08.495 --> 04:09.996
Uh, what about the package?

04:10.464 --> 04:14.100
Don't know exactly,
but Murphy's acting weird.

04:14.134 --> 04:15.535
More than usual.

04:15.803 --> 04:17.003
Where's this new destination?

04:17.036 --> 04:19.105
It's Fort Collins, Colorado.

04:19.139 --> 04:20.373
What happened to California?

04:20.406 --> 04:21.240
Lab's dark again.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.943
Maybe for good. You've been redeployed.

04:24.244 --> 04:25.211
By whose orders?

04:25.245 --> 04:27.347
Well I started picking up a teletype signal

04:27.381 --> 04:28.948
on the old civil defense frequency.

04:28.983 --> 04:30.750
At first I thought it was a hacker,

04:30.784 --> 04:32.218
but turns out it's Doctor Merch.

04:32.252 --> 04:34.954
Yeah, that Doctor Merch.
The one who injected Murphy.

04:34.989 --> 04:36.756
So delivery Murphy to Fort Collins.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.726
Doctor Merch will be there
with her team to meet you.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.626
No more California?

04:41.161 --> 04:42.996
Colorado is the new California.

04:43.263 --> 04:43.997
Copy.

04:51.171 --> 04:52.338
<i>Feel better now?</i>

04:53.273 --> 04:54.707
Yeah, a little bit.

04:59.747 --> 05:01.714
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:02.649 --> 05:03.683
<i>Try to relax.</i>

05:03.717 --> 05:05.218
How much gas do we have left?

05:05.252 --> 05:07.954
I dunno, half a tank or so.

05:08.322 --> 05:10.256
Make it 150 miles?

05:10.290 --> 05:11.891
Well if it's mostly downhill.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.794
We're real low on ammo too.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.123
Yeah?

05:44.158 --> 05:46.159
We found a taker.

05:46.193 --> 05:47.393
For what?

05:47.428 --> 05:48.961
For you.

05:48.996 --> 05:50.496
What about California?

05:50.531 --> 05:53.433
New orders.
We are headed to a lab in Fort Collins.

05:53.467 --> 05:56.502
Fort Collins?
What the hell is in Fort Collins?

05:56.537 --> 05:58.938
Dr. Merch is there waiting for you.

05:59.073 --> 06:02.375
Doctor Merch?
Yeah, I got a bone to pick with that bitch.

06:02.409 --> 06:05.745
That bitch is the reason you're still alive.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.447
Define alive.

06:16.490 --> 06:17.657
Well, Murphy.

06:17.691 --> 06:20.359
I think I'm gonna miss your sorry ass.

06:20.394 --> 06:22.128
I appreciate the sentiment.

06:22.162 --> 06:23.963
We logged some miles together, brother.

06:23.997 --> 06:24.964
Amen.

06:24.998 --> 06:26.732
Starting to feel like a damn family.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.301
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:29.570 --> 06:33.406
Uh, I... I dunno if I've actually
ever said this to anybody before

06:33.440 --> 06:34.140
But I...

06:35.275 --> 06:37.710
I almost consider you

06:37.744 --> 06:38.678
a friend.

06:39.813 --> 06:41.481
Yeah, I don't envy you though, man.

06:41.515 --> 06:44.350
I mean, hell, once we deliver you,
all bets are off.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.385
They're gonna have more
needles stuck in you than

06:46.420 --> 06:48.588
the damn tomato in grandma's sewing basket.

06:49.123 --> 06:51.557
- No, they're... they're just gonna
take out my... - Oh, trust me,

06:51.592 --> 06:53.893
they're gonna have some kind of tube or prod

06:53.927 --> 06:56.896
rammed in every spare orifice,
or my name ain't Sally.

06:56.930 --> 06:59.298
You know this one time I had a catheter.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.367
Dude, you better hope
they don't go that route.

07:01.401 --> 07:02.101
Doc.

07:02.136 --> 07:03.202
What?

07:04.671 --> 07:06.539
How much further?

07:07.207 --> 07:09.976
Uh, I dunno, 65 miles or so.

07:10.444 --> 07:11.611
Anyway,

07:11.645 --> 07:13.246
I'm gonna miss you, dude.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.848
Yeah, right.

07:15.883 --> 07:16.716
How 'bout you, kid?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.484
What do you got planned?

07:18.519 --> 07:20.686
Uh, I don't know.

07:20.721 --> 07:24.123
Still got 6,998 to go.

07:24.158 --> 07:25.291
Might take a break for a while though,

07:25.325 --> 07:26.659
head up north somewhere cold.

07:26.693 --> 07:28.227
The Zs don't fare too well in the cold.

07:28.262 --> 07:30.897
Yeah, I don't fare too
well in the cold myself.

07:30.931 --> 07:32.265
Roberta?

07:32.299 --> 07:34.367
Uh, I don't know.

07:34.401 --> 07:37.970
Maybe follow the sun west.
I've never been to California.

07:38.005 --> 07:39.038
How 'bout you, Doc?

07:39.072 --> 07:40.606
Maybe I'll buy a boat

07:40.641 --> 07:42.108
and sail around the world.

07:42.142 --> 07:45.411
Find me an island where there's
not even a Z in their alphabet.

07:53.587 --> 07:54.787
This must be it.

07:54.821 --> 07:57.890
Citizen Z said look for a
metal shed with a roll up door.

07:57.925 --> 07:59.158
Like this one?

08:01.061 --> 08:02.762
What are they all looking at?

08:03.530 --> 08:04.697
Our entrance.

08:05.832 --> 08:07.767
You think we're in the right place?

08:07.801 --> 08:09.202
Looks small.

08:17.377 --> 08:18.544
Let me see your hands.

08:19.746 --> 08:20.313
What?

08:20.614 --> 08:21.681
My hands, why?

08:21.915 --> 08:23.849
Is this a hygiene thing again?

08:23.884 --> 08:25.885
Just let me see them.

08:30.023 --> 08:31.023
What the hell are you doing?

08:31.058 --> 08:32.558
They're looking for a group of civilians

08:32.592 --> 08:33.592
transporting a prisoner.

08:33.626 --> 08:35.760
I don't want anyone
mistaking you as a zombie.

08:35.796 --> 08:36.962
Bullshit.

08:36.996 --> 08:39.799
You don't trust me.
After all the times I've saved your ass.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.866
Trust has got nothing to do with it.

08:41.902 --> 08:45.304
I don't want anyone piking
you after we got you this far.

08:46.707 --> 08:48.641
Let's just get this over with.

08:50.110 --> 08:50.810
Hey!

08:51.178 --> 08:52.578

Two bullets.

09:34.859 --> 09:35.359
I got

09:35.627 --> 09:36.226
one.

09:36.595 --> 09:37.127
One?

09:37.162 --> 09:38.395
I told you.

What?!

09:45.904 --> 09:47.671
Oh, you want my help?!

Sure,

09:51.176 --> 09:52.276
why not.

09:57.082 --> 09:58.682
Hold your pants on.

10:04.189 --> 10:05.089
Follow me.

10:05.123 --> 10:05.990
How do you know?

10:06.024 --> 10:06.857
I don't.

10:07.826 --> 10:08.592
Don't!

10:09.160 --> 10:10.427
Don't do it.

10:16.266 --> 10:17.132
All right, quick.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.300
Group hug.

10:18.535 --> 10:18.967
What?

10:19.002 --> 10:20.435
Just do it!

10:20.470 --> 10:21.870
You want to live or not?

10:32.582 --> 10:34.550
Maybe someday you'll learn to trust me.

10:35.585 --> 10:37.686
Man, I hope nobody sees us.

11:01.210 --> 11:03.178
You know before the apocalypse,

11:03.212 --> 11:06.381
I had the same effect on the ladies.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.192
Sure doesn't look operational.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.712
All those zombies up there

11:21.747 --> 11:22.847
must've wanted something down here. at?

11:22.881 --> 11:24.782
Same thing they always want.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.017
Brains.

11:26.051 --> 11:27.251
No.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.454
Something different.

11:30.756 --> 11:33.424
Something inside is
attracting them like a magnet.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.926
I can feel it.

11:53.545 --> 11:55.613
Happy damn birthday.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.282
Uh, reminds me of my 50th.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.287
Happy birthday Doctor Kur...

12:03.322 --> 12:06.090
Dibs on the last rose.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.392
What? I can't help it.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.428
Damn vaccine makes me crave sugar.

12:10.462 --> 12:12.897
Well if you start craving brains,
let me know.

12:12.931 --> 12:13.831
Ha-ha.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.101
Puppies and kittens.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.492
I'll take it from here.

12:46.096 --> 12:48.230
It won't be long now, my child.

12:48.364 --> 12:49.364
Rest.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.236
You are going to a much better place.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.160
Murphy.

13:02.064 --> 13:06.681
Considering the situation... How did you...

13:06.781 --> 13:07.982
Pilates.

13:08.817 --> 13:10.084
<i>Here they come.</i>

13:10.185 --> 13:11.185
Come on, let's take cover.

13:26.468 --> 13:27.635
Three thousand and two.

13:31.573 --> 13:33.040
Well I hope that was a zombie.

13:33.074 --> 13:34.308
Incoming at at eleven o'clock.

13:34.342 --> 13:35.709
That's all you, kid. I'm out.

13:40.019 --> 13:40.685
Damn.

13:40.719 --> 13:41.753
It's okay, kid.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.222
Remember that time in
Missouri at the Piggly Wiggly?

13:44.256 --> 13:45.523
Frozen food section?

13:45.557 --> 13:46.724
Guys? Zombies.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.437
Three thousand and three.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.205
What is that?

14:02.374 --> 14:04.042
It sounds like a phone.

14:05.644 --> 14:06.811
Over here.

14:15.383 --> 14:18.218
Looks like he was texting
his wife or somebody

14:18.253 --> 14:19.653
when it went down.

14:19.887 --> 14:21.455
Something happened at the lab today.

14:21.489 --> 14:23.090
Can't talk now. I'll call you later.

14:23.124 --> 14:25.959
Won't be home till late, not telling us why.

14:25.994 --> 14:27.394
Putting us under quarantine.

14:27.428 --> 14:29.563
Will update when I know anything.

14:29.597 --> 14:32.432
Starting to get scared,
something very wrong.

14:33.201 --> 14:35.569
Something infecting us.
We might not get out of here.

14:38.206 --> 14:41.074
Tell the kids I love them.

14:41.643 --> 14:42.609

Red death.

15:09.103 --> 15:09.736
Catchy.

15:17.378 --> 15:20.380
Not surprising they were
doing animal testing.

15:20.415 --> 15:22.683
Yeah, but what were they testing?

15:22.717 --> 15:24.685
Look at the date on these videos.

15:25.753 --> 15:28.021
It's the year before anybody was infected.

15:28.056 --> 15:30.223
How did they know to be working on a vaccine

15:30.258 --> 15:31.792
before anybody was infected.

15:33.928 --> 15:34.361
What's this?

15:34.395 --> 15:35.329
That's her.

15:35.363 --> 15:36.229
That's Doctor Merch.

15:36.264 --> 15:38.031
That's the bitch that did this to me.

15:38.066 --> 15:38.865
Okay, okay.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.933
Let's start again from the beginning.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.935
Doctor Merch,
I just got through telling you.

15:41.969 --> 15:44.371
Tell me again.
We're just trying to help you.

15:44.405 --> 15:45.639
Don't believe her!

15:45.673 --> 15:47.541
I took the suit off after my shift.

15:47.575 --> 15:48.942
At what time?

15:48.976 --> 15:50.744
7:15, like I said.

15:50.778 --> 15:52.646
And then what?

15:52.680 --> 15:53.747
Tossed it in the incinerator

15:53.781 --> 15:55.282
and went straight to decontamination.

15:55.316 --> 15:56.483
Let's back up a second.

15:56.517 --> 15:58.418
How many times are we gonna...
When you took off your suit,

15:58.453 --> 16:00.654
in what order did you remove your items?

16:00.688 --> 16:01.855
I followed protocol.

16:02.190 --> 16:02.856
Which is?

16:03.691 --> 16:04.691
Boots.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.127
And unzipped my suit.

16:07.161 --> 16:08.528
Removed it.

16:08.563 --> 16:09.696
And gloves.

16:10.164 --> 16:11.198
And then what?

16:11.232 --> 16:12.966
Tossed it in the incinerator.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.701
And went straight to... To decontamination.

16:14.736 --> 16:17.872
Did you notice anything
different on this day

16:18.140 --> 16:19.641
when handling your samples?

16:19.675 --> 16:21.676
I left the samples exactly
where I found them.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.845
Did you come in contact
with anything in the lab,

16:23.879 --> 16:25.613
anything sharp that
could've punctured your...

16:25.648 --> 16:27.382
I told you this ten times!

16:27.416 --> 16:28.783
Well something happened.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.652
There's no denying it.

16:31.720 --> 16:32.921
Something happened.

16:32.955 --> 16:34.756
The decontamination alarm went off.
That's what happened.

16:34.790 --> 16:35.423
That's right.

16:35.457 --> 16:37.058
No, but it's wrong.

16:37.092 --> 16:38.593
That's what needs to be investigated,

16:38.627 --> 16:39.627
why the alarm went off.

16:39.662 --> 16:41.062
That's what we're trying to find out.

16:41.096 --> 16:43.865
What form of contamination
set off the pathogen alarm.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.700
No. Cuz this is a false alarm.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.435
The sensor made an error

16:47.469 --> 16:49.537
because I... I didn't touch anything.

16:49.805 --> 16:50.805
I didn't puncture my suit.

16:50.839 --> 16:52.507
I didn't remove any items out of order.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.142
I followed protocol.

16:56.345 --> 16:57.745
Am I gonna be sick?

17:02.651 --> 17:05.553
Well I'm guessing it didn't end
too well for old Doyle here.

17:05.588 --> 17:07.622
Okay, who's for getting
out of here right now?

17:07.656 --> 17:08.656
Show of hands.

17:09.258 --> 17:09.790
Okay.

17:10.626 --> 17:12.093
It's back out to the apocalypse it is.

17:12.127 --> 17:13.828
Nobody's going anywhere.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.633
This is not a goddamn democracy.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.667
We came here to find Doctor Merch,

17:20.703 --> 17:23.104
and that is exactly what we are going to do.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.007
He's right.

17:26.942 --> 17:29.043
If she's down here, we just can't leave her.

17:29.445 --> 17:32.680
She is still our only chance at a vaccine.

17:32.715 --> 17:33.848
<i>You're right.</i>

17:34.249 --> 17:35.783
I just thought we might want to,

17:35.818 --> 17:36.517
I dunno,

17:37.086 --> 17:37.986
live.

17:38.988 --> 17:41.055
Yeah, well quit your dreaming and let's go.

17:54.243 --> 17:56.377
When the government abandoned this facility,

17:56.412 --> 17:58.846
they just pulled plug and walked away.

17:58.881 --> 18:00.181
And the Russians did nothing

18:00.215 --> 18:02.383
to secure the bio-weapons they left behind.

18:02.418 --> 18:04.385
This is Kazakhstan now.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.221
There is no money for anything,
not even pay policemen.

18:07.256 --> 18:10.124
What happened to all the test
animals they were using here?

18:10.159 --> 18:11.392
Who knows?

18:11.427 --> 18:13.861
Maybe destroyed. Maybe set free.

18:14.129 --> 18:17.665
These walls have many sad stories to tell.

18:19.368 --> 18:23.504
These fools,
they come here to steal copper and titanium.

18:33.115 --> 18:34.682
He's already dead.

18:34.717 --> 18:37.819
Hmmm,
he was alive when I found him yesterday.

18:37.853 --> 18:39.120
Why didn't you <i> help</i> him?

18:39.154 --> 18:41.489
I can't be responsible for
every vodka-soaked idiot

18:41.523 --> 18:43.357
who comes in here to steal.

18:43.392 --> 18:45.126
Besides, he was already too far gone.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.096
He's of no use to me dead.

18:49.398 --> 18:51.299
But you'll still pay me, my friend.

18:52.768 --> 18:54.202
Help me turn him over.

19:01.110 --> 19:02.577
What are you doing?!

19:03.912 --> 19:05.313
Science.

19:27.503 --> 19:29.704
Zombie apocalypse,
how may I direct your call?

19:29.738 --> 19:30.738
Operation Bite Mark?

19:30.773 --> 19:32.840
Uh, yeah, what's left of us.
This is Doc speaking.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.609
Excellent. Are you all still together?

19:34.643 --> 19:36.811
Correctomundo. Nice to hear your voice.

19:36.845 --> 19:38.546
So what fresh hell awaits us?

19:38.580 --> 19:40.848
According to the operations
manual I've hacked into,

19:40.883 --> 19:42.884
you're going to need to go
through decontamination.

19:42.918 --> 19:44.418
Well that sounds great to me

19:44.453 --> 19:47.355
cuz I ain't had a decent shower since,
let's see,

19:47.589 --> 19:48.656
New York.

19:48.690 --> 19:50.525
Well it's not exactly a shower.

19:50.559 --> 19:52.126
But here's the most important thing.

19:52.161 --> 19:54.428
It is imperative that
you decontaminate again

19:54.463 --> 19:56.764
before going back to the surface.

19:56.965 --> 20:00.902
This lab is equipped with Def con
One level quarantine assurance.

20:01.003 --> 20:02.537
Def con One?

20:02.571 --> 20:04.739
Well isn't that some kind of nuclear term?

20:05.040 --> 20:07.408
In the event of the breach
of the quarantine system,

20:07.442 --> 20:09.243
the lab is targeted to be incinerated

20:09.278 --> 20:10.812
by a tactical nuclear weapon.

20:11.246 --> 20:12.713
What am I not surprised?

20:12.748 --> 20:14.115
And there's one other thing

20:14.149 --> 20:16.484
about the decontamination
process you need to know.

20:17.452 --> 20:18.753
Yeah, what's that?

20:19.388 --> 20:20.621
Naked?

20:20.889 --> 20:22.123
That's what he said.

20:22.624 --> 20:23.391
Naked.

20:24.459 --> 20:26.060
And then we got to put
all our clothes and stuff

20:26.094 --> 20:28.830
in this chute here to get
decontaminated with some

20:28.864 --> 20:30.531
liquid nitrogen.

20:30.566 --> 20:32.366
So what are we waiting for?

20:33.168 --> 20:35.369
For y'all to turn around.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.005
And no peeking.

20:41.376 --> 20:42.577
Eyes up front, young man.

20:42.611 --> 20:44.579
Sorry. Sorry.

20:44.613 --> 20:45.680
Cassandra, you okay?

20:46.014 --> 20:47.748
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

20:47.783 --> 20:50.251
You hang in there. Doc, what now?

20:50.285 --> 20:52.420
Oh, we got to put these on.

20:52.721 --> 20:53.988
And... and then you got to

20:54.022 --> 20:55.523
hit that button marked decontamination

20:55.557 --> 20:56.924
in front of you, 10K.

20:59.228 --> 21:00.695
Murphy.

21:00.729 --> 21:01.863
Your scars.

21:01.897 --> 21:04.131
It looks like it's spreading.

21:04.666 --> 21:07.335
That's what I wanted to
talk to Doctor Merch about.

21:07.369 --> 21:09.003
Well put your goggles on and quit staring.

21:09.037 --> 21:11.072
I'm not the goddamn elephant man.

21:11.106 --> 21:12.773
I'm a human being.

21:13.842 --> 21:14.876
Sort of.

21:14.910 --> 21:16.310
Are you ready?

21:16.345 --> 21:17.445
Just do it.

21:25.587 --> 21:27.755
Man, I think I fried my gonads.

21:27.890 --> 21:30.591
I shoulda used sunscreen on my junk.

21:31.927 --> 21:32.460
Hey.

21:33.095 --> 21:34.929
You're okay.

21:35.264 --> 21:37.498
I don't think I can go much further.

21:41.003 --> 21:42.069
I've got her.

21:42.638 --> 21:44.672
I'll carry her if I have to.

21:48.510 --> 21:50.745
Okay. Sure.

21:56.985 --> 21:58.519
Can you see anything?

21:58.553 --> 22:00.888
Hold on, little too dark.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.859
There's some kind of
emergency lights flashing.

22:06.061 --> 22:08.696
Dude, it says quarantine.

22:08.730 --> 22:09.897
Can't we just believe them?

22:09.932 --> 22:11.232
What are you, high?

22:11.266 --> 22:12.934
We're infected already, remember?

22:29.818 --> 22:31.819
What is this place?

22:41.730 --> 22:45.399
This isn't a hospital.
It's a goddamn hall of horrors.

22:45.434 --> 22:46.534
<i>Hey, look.</i>

22:49.938 --> 22:52.273
Oh my God.

22:57.980 --> 22:59.947
I hope God doesn't know about this.

22:59.982 --> 23:01.148
Cuz if he does...

23:01.183 --> 23:02.450
We should give her mercy.

23:02.484 --> 23:03.651
No.

23:03.685 --> 23:07.254
If we open this door,
them flies are gonna be feeding on us.

23:17.432 --> 23:18.499
Over here.

23:18.533 --> 23:20.634
This one's gone. The door's open.

23:22.404 --> 23:23.404
What was it?

23:24.006 --> 23:25.706
Better question is

23:25.741 --> 23:26.674
where'd it go?

23:27.642 --> 23:29.777
Well whatever it is, it's still here.

23:31.046 --> 23:31.712
Shut the...

23:32.881 --> 23:34.315
There's another one.

23:34.349 --> 23:35.282
Murphy.

23:35.317 --> 23:37.752
Go talk to them. Do... do that thing you do.

23:55.504 --> 23:56.704
Guys.

23:57.339 --> 23:59.607
These aren't regular zombies.

23:59.641 --> 24:01.809
They're some kind of mutant thing.

24:02.778 --> 24:04.445
I don't think they like me!

24:37.018 --> 24:39.019
Let's go find Merch.

24:40.488 --> 24:42.656
What's he gonna do when
he catches up to Merch?

24:42.690 --> 24:44.958
I dunno, but I'm glad I'm not her.

24:44.992 --> 24:47.227
Be ready for anything. Let's go.

24:58.110 --> 25:00.611
This is the patient I was telling you about.

25:01.580 --> 25:03.481
How long has he been like this?

25:03.515 --> 25:04.916
Since the earthquake. Almost...

25:05.551 --> 25:07.084
seven years now.

25:07.286 --> 25:10.054
He was buried under rubble
for 21 days and survived,

25:10.088 --> 25:12.757
but has been in this state since his rescue.

25:12.891 --> 25:15.326
Is he responsive at all?

25:15.894 --> 25:17.295
In a strange way.

25:17.629 --> 25:19.163
Can you sit up, please?

25:23.735 --> 25:25.069
He responds to commands

25:25.103 --> 25:27.772
but seems to be completely
unaware of his surroundings

25:27.806 --> 25:29.740
and has no will of his own.

25:30.242 --> 25:31.576
Has he ever spoken?

25:31.610 --> 25:32.343
No.

25:33.312 --> 25:34.879
The staff has nicknamed him "the zombie."

25:36.148 --> 25:37.415
Really?

25:50.629 --> 25:51.963
Fascinating.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.967
If you'll excuse me a minute.

25:57.102 --> 25:58.436
Of course.

26:00.405 --> 26:02.106
You can lower your arm.

26:03.275 --> 26:04.709
Turn toward me.

26:07.412 --> 26:08.880
Lie back down.

26:31.403 --> 26:33.437
I can't do it.

26:34.673 --> 26:35.439
Stop.

26:35.474 --> 26:36.340
I can carry you.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.808
You're gonna be okay.

26:40.479 --> 26:42.513
I'm gonna get us all killed.

26:43.849 --> 26:44.882
Please,

26:45.250 --> 26:46.551
Tommy.

26:49.021 --> 26:50.021
Okay.

26:58.564 --> 27:01.399
Just don't tell anybody my name, all right?

27:02.134 --> 27:03.568
I won't.

27:08.640 --> 27:09.740
Hey.

27:10.576 --> 27:11.242
Is she...?

27:11.343 --> 27:12.643
She's still alive.

27:21.920 --> 27:23.187
What happened?

27:24.690 --> 27:26.624
You can stay here and get some rest.

27:26.658 --> 27:28.159
And we'll come back for you.

27:28.994 --> 27:29.627
Look.

27:30.596 --> 27:32.396
I've been saving this
special since New York.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.334
I want you to have it.

27:37.569 --> 27:38.569
Just in case.

27:40.305 --> 27:42.073
Thank you, Warren.

27:42.174 --> 27:43.741
You got it.

27:44.776 --> 27:46.544
You hang in there, darlin'.

27:46.845 --> 27:49.013
We're gonna find you some antibiotics,

27:49.114 --> 27:51.782
and we're gonna get you
straightened out in no time.

28:03.929 --> 28:06.263
Thank you, Tommy.

28:18.377 --> 28:19.210
Guys,

28:19.411 --> 28:20.244
come on.

28:20.445 --> 28:22.013
I think I found something.

28:22.848 --> 28:24.715
Is she gonna make it?

28:26.752 --> 28:29.320
You might want to say your goodbyes.

29:03.055 --> 29:04.288
Let's go.

29:07.292 --> 29:08.693
Check this out.

29:10.195 --> 29:12.830
This trail of gore leads to here.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.368
Biocontainment.

29:36.388 --> 29:39.023
Could this place get any creepier?

29:39.624 --> 29:40.991
Yes.

29:52.671 --> 29:54.405
Oh my God.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.775
It's alive.

29:58.744 --> 30:00.511
Is that Doctor Merch?

30:04.015 --> 30:04.849
No.

30:06.017 --> 30:07.284
Somebody else.

30:07.986 --> 30:10.054
It's the lab tech in the video.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.334
He wants us to watch something.

30:25.470 --> 30:27.138
Why are you doing this to me?

30:27.172 --> 30:28.239
It's for your own good, Brendon.

30:28.273 --> 30:29.707
You've started to react to the virus.

30:29.741 --> 30:31.509
Don't give me that shit you've
been giving the monkeys.

30:31.543 --> 30:32.710
I've seen the side effects.

30:32.744 --> 30:35.546
We can't take the chance the
virus has jumped to humans.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.414
You'll be the first human
trial of the vaccine.

30:37.449 --> 30:38.549
We can't wait any longer.

30:38.717 --> 30:41.485
What's gonna happen to me?

30:41.520 --> 30:42.553
We don't know.

30:54.525 --> 30:55.592
Hold him down.

30:56.027 --> 30:56.960
Hold him down!

30:58.396 --> 30:59.496
Hold him still.

31:00.198 --> 31:01.932
And turn off that camera.

31:08.539 --> 31:10.006
The vaccine must have worked.

31:11.008 --> 31:12.709
Kept him from turning zombie.

31:13.411 --> 31:15.278
But it won't let him die.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.081
Did Merch do this to you?

31:20.818 --> 31:22.319
He's trying to say something.

31:24.488 --> 31:26.590
Kill me.

31:26.891 --> 31:28.258
<i>Kill me.</i>

31:30.428 --> 31:31.761
Kill me.

31:32.096 --> 31:33.396
<i>Kill me.</i>

31:34.031 --> 31:35.765
We're getting the hell out of here.

31:36.801 --> 31:38.001
You've got company.

31:38.035 --> 31:40.370
Looks like Doctor Merch and
two soldiers headed your way.

31:40.404 --> 31:41.905
They should be there any second.

31:42.773 --> 31:43.440
Heads up.

31:52.583 --> 31:54.417
Doctor Merch.

31:54.852 --> 31:56.453
We meet again.

32:01.759 --> 32:03.093
Doctor Merch didn't make it.

32:03.461 --> 32:05.495
I'm here boss, Doctor Kurtz.

32:05.830 --> 32:09.099
I'm here to help you save mankind.

32:10.886 --> 32:12.820
Wow. Somebody made their mama proud.

32:18.260 --> 32:19.961
That's not Doctor Kurtz.

32:20.596 --> 32:22.130
Who the hell is this?

32:26.602 --> 32:29.504
We've gone to a great deal of
effort to find you, Mr. Murphy.

32:29.538 --> 32:31.306
I've been on a little road trip.

32:31.340 --> 32:34.175
Well your journey ends here.
You're safe now.

32:34.209 --> 32:36.377
And your friends are to
be commended for their

32:36.412 --> 32:38.146
bravery and commitment.

32:38.247 --> 32:42.150
Your country, all mankind,
owes you a great deal.

32:42.585 --> 32:43.952
What's going to happen to him?

32:44.053 --> 32:47.488
Well we'll take him the rest of
the way to the lab in California

32:47.523 --> 32:49.857
where we'll sequence his genes

32:50.125 --> 32:51.926
and clone the antibodies in his blood.

32:52.294 --> 32:53.861
Then with any luck,

32:54.196 --> 32:56.230
we'll be able to recreate the vaccine

32:56.265 --> 32:57.599
that's keeping him alive.

32:59.635 --> 33:01.369
Doctor... Kurian?

33:01.503 --> 33:03.338
Who are you Doctor Kurian?

33:08.077 --> 33:09.410
Redacted my ass.

33:14.683 --> 33:16.918
What if I don't want to be your guinea pig?

33:17.386 --> 33:21.189
Well then you'll eventually
wind up just like Brendon Doyle,

33:21.457 --> 33:23.324
Patient Zero over there.

33:23.425 --> 33:24.525
Speaking of which,

33:24.560 --> 33:26.661
someone should really give
that poor creature mercy.

33:26.929 --> 33:27.996
I'll do it.

33:45.180 --> 33:47.115
I'm sorry.

33:52.388 --> 33:54.389
I'm sorry about all of it.

33:59.228 --> 34:00.595
Don't

34:01.563 --> 34:02.563
trust

34:04.233 --> 34:05.233
him.

34:06.769 --> 34:10.333
Don't... trust... him.

34:18.175 --> 34:19.074
I'm not going.

34:20.177 --> 34:20.944
Murphy.

34:21.846 --> 34:23.847
This is why we came this far.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.748
Explain to me again why I
should believe anything you say.

34:26.917 --> 34:29.252
Let's start with you have no choice.

34:30.254 --> 34:31.154
What are you doing?

34:31.388 --> 34:32.489
Just a precaution.

34:32.523 --> 34:34.224
Now just hold on a minute.

34:34.257 --> 34:36.659
Ain't no reason to just bad.
He's just nervous.

34:36.694 --> 34:38.094
Right, Murphy?

34:38.762 --> 34:40.663
He's actually very civic minded.

34:49.873 --> 34:50.974
No!

34:51.007 --> 34:53.810
Wanted by Interpol for
selling bio weapon technology

34:53.844 --> 34:55.777
to North Korea, Iran, Iraq.

34:55.813 --> 34:57.447
Under investigation for

34:57.748 --> 34:59.782
the development of battlefield hypnotics.

35:01.418 --> 35:03.753
This guy didn't create the vaccine.

35:04.021 --> 35:06.322
Oh my God, I've lead them into a trap.

35:06.357 --> 35:08.525
Delta-Xray-Delta! Do you copy?

35:08.726 --> 35:11.261
Delta-Xray-Delta! Come in!

35:11.362 --> 35:14.297
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Delta-Xray-Delta! Do you copy?

35:14.398 --> 35:16.198
- Delta-Xray-Delta!
- Really, this is so unnecessary.

35:16.232 --> 35:18.066
No one is going to harm you Mr Murphy

35:18.534 --> 35:19.801
- Delta-Xray-Delta!
- Quite the opposite.

35:19.836 --> 35:20.869
Do you copy?

35:20.903 --> 35:22.571
Kill the doctor.

35:22.605 --> 35:24.539
- You have to kill the doctor.

35:26.209 --> 35:27.342
Just a zombie.

35:27.377 --> 35:29.378
Give it mercy so it won't attract more.

35:29.412 --> 35:31.246
Zombies can't open doors, can they?

35:52.201 --> 35:53.902
Don't shoot.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.206
She's a zombie.

35:58.241 --> 35:59.408
Mercy her.

36:02.178 --> 36:04.746
I'm not dead.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.055
Kill him.

36:27.929 --> 36:28.696
Murphy, wait!

36:37.873 --> 36:38.773
Doc!

36:39.841 --> 36:40.641
Doc.

36:41.676 --> 36:42.710
Doc.

36:43.211 --> 36:46.046
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

36:46.548 --> 36:47.581
Look at me.

37:01.990 --> 37:03.057
Murphy!

37:04.292 --> 37:05.159
You.

37:05.326 --> 37:07.094
You set me up, you bastard.

37:07.128 --> 37:09.663
- You set us all up!
- No! No, I didn't.

37:09.831 --> 37:12.332
I had no idea this was gonna happen.
I swear.

37:12.367 --> 37:14.334
- You have to believe me.
- No, I don't!

37:14.369 --> 37:16.603
I don't have to believe
anything anyone says ever again!

37:16.938 --> 37:18.205
Especially you!

37:18.239 --> 37:19.540
You have got to listen to me.

37:19.574 --> 37:20.574
You're infected with the virus.

37:20.608 --> 37:22.209
If you attempt to exit the lab

37:22.410 --> 37:24.011
without going through decontamination,

37:24.045 --> 37:25.446
you're gonna set off the fail safe.

37:25.480 --> 37:26.380
And why should I care?

37:26.414 --> 37:27.181
Damn it, Murphy! Listen!

37:27.215 --> 37:29.083
I lost everything!

37:29.250 --> 37:30.517
Including myself!

37:30.618 --> 37:31.752
Murphy.

37:31.786 --> 37:33.954
A tactical nuclear weapon
will be launched from NORAD

37:33.988 --> 37:35.255
to incinerate the lab.

37:35.690 --> 37:38.625
If you go up, you will kill everyone there,

37:38.660 --> 37:41.328
including Warren, Doc, and the others.

37:41.663 --> 37:43.230
Do you read me?

37:43.731 --> 37:45.999
Murphy, do you read me?

37:49.137 --> 37:49.970
Murphy!

37:53.523 --> 37:56.992
Murphy! I did not set you up.
Do you copy?

38:00.224 --> 38:01.024
Murphy!

38:02.993 --> 38:05.561
<i>Fail safe activated.</i>

38:06.163 --> 38:08.031
<i>Fail safe activated.</i>

38:08.766 --> 38:11.100
<i>Seven minutes to detonation.</i>

38:25.449 --> 38:28.549
Come on, Doc.

38:37.493 --> 38:38.826
Come on, Doc.

38:39.561 --> 38:42.230
<i>Six minutes to detonation.</i>

39:00.883 --> 39:02.183
Wake up, Doc.

39:05.087 --> 39:06.054
Come on Doc.

39:10.459 --> 39:11.159
Get out of here!

39:11.660 --> 39:13.161
- Get out of here!
- Wake up, Doc.

39:13.362 --> 39:14.395
- Now!
- Wake up, Doc.

39:14.430 --> 39:16.297
Get out of here now!

39:21.236 --> 39:22.403
<i>Five minutes to detonation.</i>

39:22.438 --> 39:23.304
Come on.

39:24.306 --> 39:25.106
Come on.

39:27.042 --> 39:28.710
What the hell is happening?

39:30.279 --> 39:31.579
Holy crap.

39:32.014 --> 39:34.782
They must be third strike
weapons on a dead man switch.

39:44.493 --> 39:46.461
What is wrong with us?

39:57.840 --> 40:00.742
<i>Four minutes to detonation.</i>

40:07.082 --> 40:08.616
Where are you headed?

40:15.357 --> 40:16.758
Oh.

40:25.667 --> 40:26.868
Get the door.

40:33.175 --> 40:35.476
<i>Three minutes to detonation.</i>

40:45.821 --> 40:46.821
Look.

40:48.757 --> 40:49.891
What is it?

40:51.059 --> 40:53.161
Is that all that's left of Murphy?

40:53.195 --> 40:54.595
It's his skin.

40:55.130 --> 40:56.664
He shed his skin.

40:56.999 --> 40:57.565
Keep it.

40:59.668 --> 41:01.903
Make some awesome boots out of that.

41:02.638 --> 41:03.871
Where's Murphy?

41:14.483 --> 41:15.383
Where's the van?

41:15.417 --> 41:15.883
Murphy.

41:16.485 --> 41:17.485
Come on, let's take this.

41:23.425 --> 41:24.325
Look.

41:30.599 --> 41:31.833
Let's go.

41:36.672 --> 41:37.872
Cassandra?

42:11.273 --> 42:13.541
God, I hate the apocalypse.
