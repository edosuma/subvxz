WEBVTT

00:25.016 --> 00:26.047
Good morning, Phil.

00:26.476 --> 00:27.590
Tom. How are you doing?

00:28.645 --> 00:29.735
It's almost Friday.

00:29.759 --> 00:31.823
Rough week
to be selling insurance?

00:31.847 --> 00:35.474
- You want me to tell you about it?
- No, thank you, Tom.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.974
Excuse me. There's a bakery
around here, isn't there?

00:53.998 --> 00:58.002
Yeah, it is two blocks up
and make a left.

00:58.466 --> 00:59.747
Thanks.

01:36.004 --> 01:37.249
Oh, my God.

02:07.577 --> 02:09.261
Oh, my God.

02:09.285 --> 02:13.286
He just ran in the street. L...

02:13.791 --> 02:15.594
Did anyone else see that?

02:15.618 --> 02:18.794
Callen. Callen.

02:20.423 --> 02:21.430
I couldn't stop.

02:21.454 --> 02:25.024
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Is he breathing?

02:25.048 --> 02:27.545
Somebody call an ambulance!

02:28.139 --> 02:29.906
Somebody call 911.

02:29.930 --> 02:32.637
- Call 911.
- Oh, God.

03:00.463 --> 03:02.811
So last night I'm having a drink
at the place Macy took me

03:02.835 --> 03:04.252
after my first shootout.

03:04.509 --> 03:07.426
I just wanted some alone time,
but this guy walks over.

03:08.096 --> 03:10.479
Attractive, well-dressed,
bonus points for taking the lead.

03:10.503 --> 03:12.758
- You know the drill.
- All too well.

03:13.101 --> 03:14.595
Guess what he used as his opener.

03:15.978 --> 03:20.367
"Hi, my name is
Mr. L-Have-No-Idea-What-I'm-In-For.

03:20.391 --> 03:22.085
- Can I buy you a drink?"
- See?

03:22.109 --> 03:24.292
There wouldn't have been
anything wrong with that.

03:24.316 --> 03:25.650
But that's not what he said.

03:26.823 --> 03:30.084
"Hey, there. Noticed your boots.

03:30.108 --> 03:34.496
It takes a girl with a unique style
to pull that off."

03:34.831 --> 03:35.969
Unique style?

03:35.993 --> 03:38.597
As in weird? As in ugly?

03:38.621 --> 03:40.144
The boots were completely normal.

03:40.168 --> 03:41.854
The boots don't matter.

03:41.878 --> 03:43.706
He was running game on you.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.097
What?

03:45.121 --> 03:48.276
Game. The art of seduction.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.115
He offered to buy you a drink,
he'd be looking to get your approval.

03:51.139 --> 03:53.488
- He turned the tables.
- Putting me on the defensive.

03:53.512 --> 03:56.090
And trying to earn his approval
on a subconscious level.

03:56.477 --> 03:57.568
It's game.

03:57.592 --> 03:59.395
That stuff doesn't work on me.

03:59.689 --> 04:01.847
At least
you didn't give him your number.

04:03.609 --> 04:04.938
Right?

04:10.199 --> 04:11.362
Oh, boy.

04:12.326 --> 04:13.869
Have you seen Callen today?

04:45.526 --> 04:46.937
This guy buy you a drink?

04:48.070 --> 04:51.605
- Told me he'd let me buy him a drink.
- Game.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.207
Kept checking his phone

04:53.231 --> 04:55.710
- like he had better places to be.
- Game.

04:55.734 --> 04:58.663
Leaned in for a kiss
15 minutes after meeting me.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.634
Definitely game.

05:00.658 --> 05:02.577
At least you didn't let him.

05:03.419 --> 05:04.913
- Right?
- No.

05:09.967 --> 05:13.727
Who do you think
taught Mr. Beale to do that?

05:13.751 --> 05:16.800
- What's up, Hetty?
- Agent Callen's in trouble.

05:17.266 --> 05:20.801
He enacted the Beauregard Protocol
via text message.

05:21.938 --> 05:23.313
His current cover's been blown.

05:23.940 --> 05:27.640
- How did this happen?
- That's not clear for the moment.

05:27.944 --> 05:30.078
The only thing we know for certain

05:30.102 --> 05:33.529
is that our operations
have been breached.

05:33.991 --> 05:37.419
As of this moment,
we are not to make contact with him.

05:37.443 --> 05:40.954
That means you, Mr. Hanna.

05:41.707 --> 05:44.744
Callen's message to Hetty
also contained a location in Venice.

05:45.128 --> 05:47.665
Intersection of
Horizon and Speedway.

05:48.631 --> 05:50.873
That's two blocks
from his rooming house.

05:51.801 --> 05:54.398
This is traffic cam footage
pulled from that intersection

05:54.422 --> 05:56.967
approximately 15 minutes ago.

06:02.270 --> 06:03.277
I'll call Deeks.

06:03.301 --> 06:06.409
Make sure L.A.P.D. Knows
we'll be handling this discreetly.

06:06.433 --> 06:09.015
Eric, pull up everything you've got
about this guy.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.297
According to initial reports,

06:14.321 --> 06:16.210
the dead man's name
was Michael St. Paris.

06:16.234 --> 06:17.879
No criminal record.

06:17.903 --> 06:19.797
Employed by
North Gate Elite Security.

06:19.821 --> 06:23.199
They're a private investigation firm
specialising in surveillance work.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.596
He was running a tail.
G caught him, so St. Paris bolted.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.810
I'll call North Gate
and see who hired him.

06:28.834 --> 06:31.020
Callen left the crash scene
almost immediately.

06:31.044 --> 06:33.065
He must have stuck to blind spots
and moved fast

06:33.089 --> 06:34.539
because no cameras got him.

06:35.094 --> 06:38.154
Also, his phone went dead
right after he sent that alert to Hetty.

06:38.178 --> 06:39.379
Off the grid.

06:39.724 --> 06:42.950
Could this have anything to do with
Agent Macy's murder in Annapolis?

06:42.974 --> 06:45.611
No. It's unrelated.

06:45.635 --> 06:48.055
What's Callen gonna do now?

06:49.066 --> 06:51.308
What he does best:

06:51.611 --> 06:52.986
Become a ghost.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.654
So we can't find him?

06:58.284 --> 07:01.487
Not until he's ready to be found.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.604
Thank you.

07:38.574 --> 07:40.781
- There's one.
- Oh.

07:43.829 --> 07:46.806
North Gate said an unidentified man
hired them over the phone

07:46.830 --> 07:48.707
to keep tabs of G's movements.

07:49.627 --> 07:51.512
A single payment was sent
as a cashier's cheque.

07:51.536 --> 07:53.183
The firm didn't ask any questions.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.923
Well, how long was the tail active?

07:55.341 --> 07:57.274
G caught their man within minutes.

07:57.298 --> 08:00.480
The firm was only tasked
with surveillance. No background.

08:00.504 --> 08:03.550
They don't know anything
about NCIS or Callen's identity.

08:04.267 --> 08:07.267
All they got from the man who hired
them was Callen's name and address.

08:18.614 --> 08:20.132
Hey, buddy.

08:20.156 --> 08:22.994
Buddy.
Weirdest thing just happened.

08:23.452 --> 08:24.508
A guy just called the store.

08:24.532 --> 08:27.171
Says he wants to talk
to my most recent customer.

08:27.195 --> 08:29.247
Which is you.

08:41.261 --> 08:42.269
Yeah?

08:42.293 --> 08:43.857
Mr. Callen.

08:43.881 --> 08:48.196
Or do you prefer "special agent"?

08:48.220 --> 08:50.197
Sorry, bud. Wrong guy.

08:50.221 --> 08:53.159
The payphone
on Ocean Walk and Sunset.

08:53.183 --> 08:54.614
You got three minutes.

08:54.638 --> 08:58.815
And, Mr. Callen?
I know what the G stands for.

09:18.374 --> 09:19.916
- That's for me.
- All right, man.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.013
Okay, I'm here. Who is it?

09:24.037 --> 09:26.336
My name is Eugene Keelson.

09:26.882 --> 09:28.602
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure yet.

09:28.626 --> 09:30.378
We haven't.

09:31.053 --> 09:32.512
So who are you?

09:32.846 --> 09:35.682
Well, someone who knows more
than just your name and address.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.300
I have answers.

09:38.853 --> 09:40.821
And the name of the individual
who hired me

09:40.845 --> 09:43.512
to uncover every detail about you.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.203
Sam, Kensi.
I just got a message from Callen.

09:49.227 --> 09:53.354
He's at a payphone at the corner
of Ocean Walk and Sunset.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.507
I'm initiating a trace now.

09:56.531 --> 09:58.530
Okay, I'll bite.

09:58.747 --> 09:59.910
What do you know?

10:00.583 --> 10:03.786
A wealth of information
that I think you'd be interested in.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.117
What?

10:06.630 --> 10:08.729
And I'm willing
to share this information

10:08.753 --> 10:11.296
in exchange for a small favour.

10:11.886 --> 10:13.938
What makes you think
you've found something I haven't?

10:13.962 --> 10:16.807
Because I have access
to things you don't even know exist.

10:17.182 --> 10:19.151
So you haven't been asking
the right questions.

10:19.175 --> 10:22.518
This goes deeper
than your name and your family.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.236
You've been asking "who?"

10:24.260 --> 10:28.900
When maybe you should start
asking "why?"

10:29.236 --> 10:31.276
How small is this favour?

10:33.949 --> 10:36.760
Ugh. The caller disconnected.
I was five seconds away

10:36.784 --> 10:38.339
from triangulating his location.

10:38.363 --> 10:40.411
He knew what we were doing
as we were doing it.

10:45.628 --> 10:46.683
Impressive.

10:46.707 --> 10:48.978
Well, some people play checkers.

10:49.002 --> 10:51.165
We both play chess, don't we?

10:51.467 --> 10:53.934
You say you've got answers.
Show me.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.674
Reach underneath the payphone.
You'll find an envelope. Open it.

11:10.444 --> 11:13.528
Does that qualify as proof,
Mr. Callen?

11:15.824 --> 11:17.651
Mr. Callen?

11:19.870 --> 11:20.961
How did you get this?

11:20.985 --> 11:24.034
You need to decide if you're
gonna do this favour for me or not.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.462
Tell me what you want me to do.

11:30.798 --> 11:32.482
Do you see the flash drive?

11:32.506 --> 11:34.892
Deliver it to some clients of mine.
A group of Bulgarians.

11:34.916 --> 11:36.813
The location is listed
inside the envelope.

11:36.837 --> 11:38.696
You're gonna give them
the flash drive

11:38.720 --> 11:41.439
in exchange for a cash payment.

11:41.463 --> 11:44.512
- Who will the Bulgarians think I am?
- Me.

11:46.021 --> 11:49.532
- Will they expect an accent?
- No. They think I'm American.

11:49.556 --> 11:51.120
But be warned.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.046
If you are unable
to convince my clients

11:54.070 --> 11:57.499
that you are indeed Eugene Keelson

11:57.523 --> 11:59.633
then they will not hesitate to kill you.

11:59.657 --> 12:02.234
Are you having second thoughts?

12:04.707 --> 12:07.791
Well, I've been set up before.
This is pretty much the way it feels.

12:08.919 --> 12:10.971
If I can get to you,

12:10.995 --> 12:14.042
how easy do you think it would be
for me to get to the rest of your team?

12:14.717 --> 12:17.172
NCIS has been compromised.

12:17.928 --> 12:21.878
The only way you'll find out how badly
is by doing as you are told.

12:24.893 --> 12:26.862
Where do I bring the cash
after I've done the deal?

12:26.886 --> 12:29.078
I'll contact you.

12:29.102 --> 12:32.036
You have 30 minutes
to get it to the Bulgarians.

12:32.060 --> 12:35.828
If you contact anyone else,
our deal is off.

12:35.852 --> 12:40.549
If you try to decrypt the drive,
our deal is off.

12:40.573 --> 12:42.960
- Keelson...
- If you ever wanted to find out

12:42.984 --> 12:47.385
the truth about yourself,
now's your chance.

12:47.409 --> 12:48.697
Do you understand?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.518
- Yes.
- And your outfit looks sharp,

12:53.542 --> 12:55.920
but I'd lose the baseball cap
if I were you, Mr. Callen.

13:01.221 --> 13:02.822
Ugh. I was able
to triangulate the source

13:02.846 --> 13:04.615
to within one block of the payphone,

13:04.639 --> 13:07.893
but whoever it was
disconnected just in time.

13:08.270 --> 13:09.989
Prepaid burn phone most likely.

13:10.013 --> 13:12.062
Guy's probably already trashed it
and now he's...

13:14.401 --> 13:16.193
A server breach alert
in the Ops Center?

13:17.362 --> 13:18.998
Hold on. I gotta ID this and be sure.

13:19.022 --> 13:20.751
Is it related to Callen's call?

13:20.775 --> 13:22.503
No, totally separate.

13:22.527 --> 13:25.761
Trojan horse virus.
Conficker variant. F-type strain.

13:25.785 --> 13:27.923
This is a serious attack.

13:27.947 --> 13:31.539
I'm opening firewalls to block it from
accessing any more of our system.

13:32.086 --> 13:33.472
What's happening, Eric?

13:33.496 --> 13:35.888
It's broken through the firewalls.

13:35.912 --> 13:37.939
I'm losing control of the system.

13:37.963 --> 13:39.568
Can you stop it?

13:39.592 --> 13:41.859
It's starting to access our files.

13:41.883 --> 13:44.093
I know.
I can route it in from another segment.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.654
Turn the system off.

13:46.678 --> 13:48.486
Yeah, which one?

13:48.510 --> 13:51.936
All of them. We're going dark.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.311
Okay.

14:09.331 --> 14:13.281
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are officially off-line.

14:15.003 --> 14:16.284
We're blind.

14:17.089 --> 14:19.354
And if G tries to check in with us?

14:19.378 --> 14:23.843
He'll get a standardized
pre-recorded service error message.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.885
He's out in the cold.

14:27.724 --> 14:29.267
Alone.

14:31.728 --> 14:34.979
The number you have
reached is not in service at this time.

14:40.195 --> 14:42.579
You have reached
a number that is not in service.

14:42.603 --> 14:44.857
Please check the number
and try your call again.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.424
I'm Marinov.

15:47.395 --> 15:49.019
Keelson.

15:49.397 --> 15:53.311
My invitation said, uh, casual,
but okay.

16:01.409 --> 16:03.982
Right there. Beautiful.

16:06.289 --> 16:09.409
I recently spoke
to our mutual friend in Chechnya.

16:09.709 --> 16:14.146
He says your source inside the FSB
has proven quite valuable to the cause.

16:14.170 --> 16:17.019
Yeah, well,
I don't discuss friends or sources.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.711
Works out better for everyone
that way.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.550
I appreciate a man
who's all business.

16:22.263 --> 16:24.588
I appreciate a good client.

16:24.807 --> 16:26.266
You got some money for me
or what?

16:32.482 --> 16:34.355
Show me the flash drive first.

16:35.151 --> 16:37.191
I want to verify the information.

16:39.322 --> 16:41.279
Knock yourself out.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.678
Satisfied?

17:08.309 --> 17:09.448
Looks accurate to me.

17:09.472 --> 17:11.886
Wonderful. So where's my money?

17:12.521 --> 17:15.166
Yes. My money.

17:15.191 --> 17:17.825
The problem is you already have it,
Mr. Keelson.

17:17.848 --> 17:19.497
- Excuse me?
- Last year,

17:19.521 --> 17:22.292
the guard shift changes you sold me
for the airstrip in Chisinau?

17:22.317 --> 17:25.467
- They were wrong.
- Wrong?

17:25.491 --> 17:29.052
Like hell they were wrong.
That information was rock solid.

17:29.076 --> 17:30.990
You screwed it up.
That's your problem.

17:31.666 --> 17:34.501
You think you can play me for a fool,
Keelson?

17:36.337 --> 17:38.851
All right, look.
A little misunderstanding, okay?

17:38.875 --> 17:41.515
Obviously something got lost
in translation.

17:41.539 --> 17:45.857
We're all good. Let's just, uh...
We'll call it even.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.964
Everyone walks away.

18:35.188 --> 18:37.619
Sidewinder Rugged Appliance.

18:37.643 --> 18:40.709
The most secure portable IPS,
anti-virus,

18:40.733 --> 18:45.207
URL, geo-location, encrypted
application filtering in the world.

18:45.231 --> 18:50.969
Let's find out how far inside
the castle walls this Trojan horse rode.

18:50.993 --> 18:52.621
I'm on it.

18:55.416 --> 18:57.076
Agent Renko.

18:58.044 --> 19:03.061
With, uh, Mr. Callen having gone
Three Days of the Condor on us,

19:03.085 --> 19:06.543
I think we need every able body
we can muster.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.501
Speaking of which, where's Sam?

19:10.515 --> 19:12.922
Hmm. Where indeed.

19:29.325 --> 19:32.385
As far as fail-safe rally points go,
I've seen worse.

19:32.409 --> 19:35.864
You said the same thing when we
picked this out five years ago.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.035
Hoped we'd never meet like this, G.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.169
Thought we'd never get made?

19:41.629 --> 19:43.171
A man can hope, can't he?

19:44.715 --> 19:50.302
First Dom, then Macy, now this.

19:51.347 --> 19:53.885
Something's going on, Sam.

19:55.351 --> 19:58.020
Hetty's convinced
they're mutually exclusive.

19:58.354 --> 20:00.073
You once told me
we ain't working hard enough

20:00.097 --> 20:01.529
if nobody's trying to kill us.

20:01.553 --> 20:04.188
I said that? Really?

20:05.736 --> 20:09.070
- Make you feel better?
- A little bit.

20:11.826 --> 20:13.569
Who burned you?

20:13.828 --> 20:15.761
A guy named Eugene Keelson.

20:15.785 --> 20:18.660
Someone hired him
to find out about me.

20:19.250 --> 20:21.159
He did his job well.

20:21.836 --> 20:23.413
What is it?

20:24.005 --> 20:26.306
It's a list of every foster home
I ever stayed at.

20:26.330 --> 20:27.882
All 37 of them.

20:28.175 --> 20:30.667
Some of those addresses
aren't even in my NCIS file.

20:32.555 --> 20:33.776
Why contact you?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.823
He wanted me to meet
with some Bulgarians,

20:35.847 --> 20:39.468
pose as him,
exchange a flash drive for a payoff.

20:40.521 --> 20:42.537
I'm gonna guess
they didn't play nice.

20:42.561 --> 20:46.812
After they downloaded the file
there was no money. Just guns.

20:47.069 --> 20:50.497
I was an insurance policy
in case things went south.

20:50.521 --> 20:53.212
And you thought going it alone
with a group of armed thugs

20:53.236 --> 20:54.416
seemed like a good idea?

20:54.440 --> 20:57.168
Keelson implied
that NCIS had been compromised.

20:57.192 --> 20:59.743
It's more than an implication.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.473
Eric found a Trojan horse virus.

21:03.497 --> 21:05.911
Had to take the Ops Center off-line.

21:09.050 --> 21:12.300
This is as close as I've ever come
to finding out who I really am.

21:14.722 --> 21:16.513
That's what I'm worried about, G.

21:26.943 --> 21:28.935
I took photos.

21:30.696 --> 21:33.567
Keep your head down
and stay out of sight, G.

21:40.206 --> 21:44.345
As far as I can tell, the Trojan horse
didn't get beyond Callen's files.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.335
Keep looking.

21:52.927 --> 21:58.633
Mr. Hanna. You know, I'm aware
you speak several languages.

21:59.183 --> 22:03.453
But I don't recall
having used one you're unfamiliar with

22:03.477 --> 22:08.083
when I instructed you
to not make contact with Mr. Callen.

22:08.107 --> 22:10.813
What makes you so sure
that I con...?

22:11.445 --> 22:14.232
It was a breach of protocol.

22:16.659 --> 22:19.114
And one I understand.

22:20.079 --> 22:21.953
So, what do we have?

22:22.289 --> 22:25.872
The guy who burned Callen
is named Eugene Keelson.

22:26.168 --> 22:28.267
Callen made a drop for him
with some Bulgarian heavies,

22:28.291 --> 22:29.542
but it went all wrong.

22:30.965 --> 22:32.768
This guy's got information
about G's past.

22:32.792 --> 22:34.852
Things that even NCIS
doesn't know about.

22:34.876 --> 22:37.674
That's what he handed over
to the Bulgarians.

22:38.264 --> 22:39.864
Oh, this is encrypted bigtime.

22:39.888 --> 22:42.156
Without the mainframe,
this is gonna take a while.

22:42.180 --> 22:45.281
These are the photos he took
before he made the drop.

22:45.305 --> 22:48.492
We need to find everything we can
on Mr. Keelson

22:48.516 --> 22:51.645
before he destroys this unit.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.366
All the Eugene Keelsons I found
check out.

23:11.038 --> 23:12.556
Same here.

23:12.580 --> 23:15.678
This temporary server is Stone-Age
compared to the Ops Center,

23:15.702 --> 23:19.577
but I just got hits on the Bulgarians
from Callen's camera.

23:22.591 --> 23:28.273
Luka Dimitrov, Ilia Tagkov,
Kosta Daimov.

23:28.297 --> 23:29.479
That's a lot of "ov's."

23:29.503 --> 23:32.718
All shot and killed this morning.
Except for this one.

23:33.435 --> 23:35.475
Ruman Marinov.

23:36.188 --> 23:37.872
And all are former Bulgarian military

23:37.896 --> 23:40.330
now involved with organised crime
in the U.S.

23:40.354 --> 23:42.898
They're using a restaurant downtown
as a front.

23:43.445 --> 23:46.173
How do you feel about goulash,
Sam?

23:46.197 --> 23:48.073
I thought goulash was Hungarian.

23:48.576 --> 23:50.295
Actually,
the dish is Eastern European.

23:50.319 --> 23:51.881
It's got a lot of variations.

23:51.905 --> 23:53.218
Essentially, it's a stew,

23:53.242 --> 23:56.201
but what they all have in common
is noodles.

23:57.001 --> 23:58.850
Thanks for the tip, Martha Stewart.

23:58.874 --> 24:01.262
Give me everything you have
on the Bulgarians' connections

24:01.286 --> 24:02.922
to other crime organisations ASAP.

24:20.608 --> 24:22.161
We're closed.

24:22.185 --> 24:23.877
On a Tuesday afternoon?

24:23.901 --> 24:25.398
That's not a good sign.

24:30.117 --> 24:31.777
I said we're closed.

24:32.828 --> 24:34.536
Five employees, no customers.

24:35.372 --> 24:38.207
This isn't gonna go down well
when I write my Zagat review.

24:40.502 --> 24:43.124
I work for Ramon Casador.

24:47.009 --> 24:49.939
How is Ramon enjoying life
in prison?

24:49.963 --> 24:53.008
Well, it's not exactly his villa
in Cartagena,

24:54.141 --> 24:56.341
but I hear for the right price
the food's pretty decent.

24:57.186 --> 25:00.056
Considering his holdings,
I'm sure he eats very well.

25:00.814 --> 25:04.397
He has a small problem
that's affecting his digestion.

25:04.985 --> 25:06.693
Eugene Keelson.

25:19.750 --> 25:20.924
Mr. Casador wants to know

25:20.948 --> 25:23.119
what kind of man
he might be getting involved with.

25:24.004 --> 25:26.875
He's heard rumours
you had dealings with him.

25:33.722 --> 25:35.490
I'll tell Mr. Casador that you're busy

25:35.514 --> 25:38.352
running
your budding restaurant empire.

25:39.937 --> 25:45.690
As far as information dealers go,
Keelson's the best.

25:46.735 --> 25:50.484
Anything you want,
he can get it for you for a price.

25:50.906 --> 25:52.566
Anything.

25:52.908 --> 25:54.948
And the price is high.

25:55.703 --> 25:56.793
Any loyalties?

25:56.817 --> 25:58.596
Only to the highest bidder.

25:58.620 --> 25:59.904
He burned you?

26:02.501 --> 26:05.182
Let's just say
he's going to be the victim

26:05.206 --> 26:08.962
of an abrupt retirement
in the very near future.

26:10.718 --> 26:12.876
Mr. Casador will appreciate the info.

26:27.651 --> 26:29.395
Okay, we're good.

26:47.337 --> 26:48.369
Hello.

26:48.672 --> 26:50.914
- Hetty.
- Mr. Callen.

26:51.925 --> 26:54.796
Is this your third cell phone
of the day?

26:55.429 --> 26:56.899
I'm keeping receipts.

26:56.923 --> 27:00.881
Oh, good.
I'll expect a detailed expense report.

27:01.310 --> 27:04.571
For all of your necessities
while on the road.

27:04.595 --> 27:07.155
And I do mean necessities.

27:07.179 --> 27:10.773
Well, I'll cancel my, uh, suite
at the Chateau Marmont.

27:12.780 --> 27:14.404
Did you find anything
on the Bulgarians?

27:15.699 --> 27:18.546
Hetty, I broke the encryption
on the flash drive.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.843
- Hetty?
- Uh, I have to go.

27:20.867 --> 27:24.074
I got burned
and I can't be involved in the case.

27:24.750 --> 27:25.912
I get it, Hetty.

27:26.293 --> 27:28.178
I do too, Mr. Callen.

27:28.202 --> 27:29.956
More than you realise.

27:32.966 --> 27:35.125
What? What's the matter?

27:35.385 --> 27:38.303
I have no idea if the drive's infected
until I open it.

27:38.722 --> 27:41.260
Well, if you don't we may not get
our only clue in this case.

27:41.975 --> 27:44.786
Live dangerously is my creed,
Mr. Beale.

27:44.810 --> 27:46.473
Go ahead. Go ahead and do it.

27:50.609 --> 27:51.664
Harmless.

27:51.688 --> 27:55.288
It's a single file containing a dossier
and a travel itinerary.

27:55.312 --> 27:56.900
Who's Andres Werner?

27:58.325 --> 28:00.044
CEO of Haupt Eisen.

28:00.068 --> 28:02.367
It's one of Germany's
largest steel corporations.

28:03.372 --> 28:06.326
Looks like he's in L.A.
Completing a corporate merger.

28:07.668 --> 28:09.471
Marinov's a major shareholder.

28:09.495 --> 28:10.832
We're talking millions.

28:11.630 --> 28:15.165
Millions that will drop like a rock
if the merger goes through.

28:15.509 --> 28:16.944
They're gonna hit him.

28:16.968 --> 28:19.400
Callen gave Marinov the dossier.

28:19.424 --> 28:22.242
He was coerced into doing so
by Keelson.

28:22.266 --> 28:25.848
But we can't allow this man
to be killed as a result.

28:26.353 --> 28:29.520
Werner's plane touches down
at LAX in an hour.

29:11.481 --> 29:12.857
Werner, get out of the car.

29:14.484 --> 29:17.034
Federal agents!
Put the weapons down!

29:17.058 --> 29:20.487
- Put the weapons down!
- Gonna be some nasty goulash.

29:30.417 --> 29:32.244
Renko!

29:33.879 --> 29:35.077
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:48.769 --> 29:51.972
- Come on. You good?
- I'm good. Yeah. Yeah.

29:52.564 --> 29:54.889
I'm calling this in to the L.A.P.D.

30:02.658 --> 30:05.303
- Mr. Hanna?
- Decoy car worked.

30:05.327 --> 30:08.091
Werner's safe.
Marinov hit us with his team.

30:08.115 --> 30:10.506
Every one of them is down
except for the man himself.

30:10.530 --> 30:12.059
Backup getaway car picked him up.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.327
Have Kensi get out an APB.

30:15.837 --> 30:16.928
She's on it.

30:16.952 --> 30:20.641
Are any of Marinov's men
in a condition to talk?

30:20.665 --> 30:22.443
They're not in a condition to breathe.

30:22.467 --> 30:25.257
We protected Werner, but we're back
at square one with Keelson.

30:26.181 --> 30:28.944
Which, unfortunately, is nowhere.

30:28.968 --> 30:30.601
Yeah.

30:37.067 --> 30:39.143
What happened to protocol?

30:40.279 --> 30:43.612
It went out
the proverbial damn window.

30:44.825 --> 30:48.822
I've been thinking a great deal
about your situation.

30:49.579 --> 30:52.343
Nate has misgivings
about your state of mind.

30:52.367 --> 30:54.783
Well, he's gonna have to get in line.

30:55.669 --> 30:59.038
During this crisis,
he thought he should have a gun.

30:59.965 --> 31:00.996
You didn't...?

31:02.342 --> 31:03.884
Perish the thought.

31:06.179 --> 31:07.460
Walk with me.

31:08.890 --> 31:14.323
This, um, Eugene Keelson
is a clever fellow.

31:14.347 --> 31:16.905
It's rare for us
when we have an adversary

31:16.929 --> 31:21.057
who knows more about our operations
than we do of him.

31:22.321 --> 31:29.070
Despite Nate's misgivings, I think
we need everyone's skills onboard.

31:29.411 --> 31:31.534
Not sure that's such a good idea.

31:33.457 --> 31:36.184
I told myself making the Bulgarian deal
might help shed some light

31:36.208 --> 31:40.160
on just how badly
Keelson had compromised our team.

31:41.506 --> 31:43.333
Is that why I did it?

31:44.217 --> 31:48.523
Or was it just an excuse
to find out about my past?

31:48.547 --> 31:51.782
Oh, only you can answer that,
Mr. Callen.

31:51.806 --> 31:53.683
I can't.

31:54.811 --> 31:56.851
Which is why Nate's right.

31:57.064 --> 31:58.474
I should stay off this case.

32:03.445 --> 32:04.536
Yes?

32:04.560 --> 32:06.707
Not good news, Hetty.
I've been tracking the damage

32:06.731 --> 32:08.674
that Keelson's virus did to our server.

32:08.698 --> 32:11.168
Callen's file isn't the only one
it got into.

32:11.192 --> 32:13.825
- Who else was compromised?
- Everyone.

32:14.581 --> 32:15.672
And everything.

32:15.696 --> 32:18.447
Keelson's got information
on every one of our cases.

32:19.753 --> 32:21.959
I'm talking NCIS worldwide.

32:22.923 --> 32:26.505
Thank you, Eric.
I'll be back with you shortly.

32:28.512 --> 32:32.568
I appreciate your noble return
to reason, Mr. Callen.

32:32.592 --> 32:35.743
But things have taken a turn.

32:35.767 --> 32:39.577
The whole of NCIS
has been compromised.

32:39.601 --> 32:43.308
Like it or not, you are back in.

32:57.324 --> 33:00.550
Callen, please tell me Hetty isn't
gonna string me up for taking a call

33:00.574 --> 33:01.882
from a burned special agent.

33:01.906 --> 33:03.407
You're good, Eric.

33:04.039 --> 33:05.129
You should see our new digs.

33:05.153 --> 33:07.016
They are much more intimate,

33:07.040 --> 33:11.016
albeit a tad shadowy, cavernous,
and slightly spooky.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.387
Eric.

33:12.411 --> 33:14.807
I need you
to bring our servers back online.

33:14.831 --> 33:17.985
I want you to reactivate the computer
virus that Keelson introduced

33:18.009 --> 33:19.150
to our system.

33:19.174 --> 33:20.816
- Are you serious?
- Very.

33:20.840 --> 33:23.279
You're asking me
to commit technological malpractice.

33:23.303 --> 33:24.933
Eric.

33:25.518 --> 33:27.096
Here we go.

33:39.824 --> 33:41.674
Virus is reactivated.

33:41.698 --> 33:43.908
Our servers are exposed again.

33:45.372 --> 33:47.921
Detecting a foreign code
inside the firewall.

33:47.945 --> 33:49.132
It's gotta be Keelson.

33:49.156 --> 33:50.389
Open a new file.

33:50.413 --> 33:52.910
Label it Keelson.
Put it somewhere he'll find it.

33:55.423 --> 33:56.455
Done.

33:57.008 --> 33:59.024
All right,
now include the following message:

33:59.048 --> 34:00.986
"Call me. I wanna cut a deal."

34:01.010 --> 34:02.270
Anything else?

34:02.294 --> 34:04.263
Give him my active phone number.

34:06.059 --> 34:09.641
We're set. Now can I ask why we're
exposing ourselves to this guy?

34:10.480 --> 34:13.029
We need to get to Keelson
before he sells the NCIS case list

34:13.053 --> 34:16.732
on the black market.
This is the only way to lure him out.

34:24.284 --> 34:26.835
Keelson likes money
more than anything.

34:26.859 --> 34:30.099
If we can offer him enough of it,
he may just expose himself

34:30.123 --> 34:32.034
long enough
for us to take him down.

34:33.460 --> 34:39.606
And what if Keelson would rather die
than face prosecution for his crimes?

34:39.630 --> 34:43.027
The information he has
about your past

34:43.051 --> 34:45.842
would likely disappear with him.

34:46.641 --> 34:50.176
Are you ready to accept that,
Mr. Callen?

34:59.112 --> 35:00.227
This is Callen.

35:00.488 --> 35:01.520
What you offering?

35:01.948 --> 35:03.277
What? No small talk?

35:03.742 --> 35:05.378
Why bother? You hate it.

35:05.402 --> 35:08.613
Or did you forget that I know you
better than you know yourself?

35:08.997 --> 35:11.760
I can't let that case list get out
into the open market.

35:11.784 --> 35:15.576
Our offer is $10 million
in untraceable U.S. Currency.

35:17.047 --> 35:20.001
Your list would bring me more
if I auctioned it myself.

35:20.467 --> 35:23.800
The longer you hold onto it, the bigger
risk you're taking. You know that.

35:24.137 --> 35:26.593
This is a guaranteed payday.

35:29.476 --> 35:31.195
Griffith Park Observatory.

35:31.219 --> 35:33.826
Be there with the money.
You got one hour.

35:33.850 --> 35:37.142
- How will I find you?
- I'll find you.

35:39.986 --> 35:42.560
I can't authorise $10 million.

35:44.741 --> 35:46.733
I wouldn't ask you to.

36:01.132 --> 36:03.089
I'm in position. Kensi?

36:04.844 --> 36:08.924
I've got eyes on Callen, but so far
no one's making an approach.

36:10.767 --> 36:11.846
Renko?

36:12.268 --> 36:15.388
I got nothing.
This guy Keelson could be anyone.

36:15.688 --> 36:17.977
He'll show up. Eric?

36:18.608 --> 36:19.806
Looks clear from here.

36:24.364 --> 36:26.498
Wait a minute.
There's a guy in sunglasses

36:26.522 --> 36:28.692
approaching Callen
from the south side of the area.

36:35.333 --> 36:37.041
Eugene Keelson.

36:38.378 --> 36:40.454
I guess some tips are legitimate
after all, huh?

36:43.466 --> 36:44.497
Everybody get down!

36:46.511 --> 36:48.919
Get down! Get down!
Get out of the way! Get down!

36:49.556 --> 36:52.592
Sam, that's him! That's Keelson!

36:53.059 --> 36:55.218
Eric, guy in the black jacket.

36:55.478 --> 36:56.557
Turn over.

37:01.317 --> 37:04.081
I'm running facial rec,
but it's gonna take a while bef...

37:04.105 --> 37:06.188
How'd we get a match that fast?

37:08.825 --> 37:12.549
Sam, it's the driver who hit
and killed the guy tailing Callen

37:12.573 --> 37:14.928
this morning.
Callen must have recognised him.

37:14.952 --> 37:17.222
- Who is he?
- No name. No address.

37:17.246 --> 37:20.501
I think we're looking at the only
two images of this guy that exist.

37:37.312 --> 37:38.889
Keelson!

37:44.110 --> 37:45.984
You exposed yourself
by coming here.

37:46.529 --> 37:48.107
That's checkers. Not chess.

37:48.781 --> 37:51.818
Yeah, well, either you or Marinov
was gonna walk away.

37:52.952 --> 37:57.080
That left me with one final loose end
to snip.

37:57.832 --> 37:59.457
You won't get that chance.

38:02.128 --> 38:03.598
You know,
there's elements at play here

38:03.622 --> 38:06.797
that are way bigger
than you and me.

38:08.676 --> 38:11.713
If you kill me,
you'll never know the truth.

38:12.805 --> 38:14.513
Who you really are.

38:15.934 --> 38:18.341
Who hired me to find you.

38:21.481 --> 38:25.075
Are you ready
to live the rest of your life

38:25.099 --> 38:28.147
wondering what that G stands for?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.389
- Eric.
- Yeah?

39:36.889 --> 39:38.265
Fire it up.

39:50.737 --> 39:52.373
I just don't understand. I'm saying...

39:52.397 --> 39:54.125
Chess.

39:54.149 --> 39:58.048
You play backgammon? Poker?
It's game. They're all games.

39:58.072 --> 40:00.036
- I'm telling you, I just...
- Games.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.545
Hey.

40:09.922 --> 40:12.793
Have you ever heard
of running game on someone?

40:13.092 --> 40:14.172
No.

40:15.345 --> 40:19.556
But that jacket you're wearing, takes
a unique kind of girl to pull that off.

40:30.443 --> 40:33.088
Glad to see everything
back up and running.

40:33.112 --> 40:36.939
You can surf the Internet
for your, uh, funny cat videos again.

40:39.077 --> 40:43.264
At least my web browsing
doesn't require a full system purge

40:43.288 --> 40:44.654
at the end of the day.

40:46.459 --> 40:49.495
I'm composing a letter
to Elizabeth Macy,

40:50.046 --> 40:53.794
someone else looking for answers.

40:54.008 --> 40:55.800
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.299
About what?

40:59.097 --> 41:02.548
You didn't get the information
you were hoping for.

41:05.645 --> 41:08.350
Keelson found answers,
I'll find them too.

41:09.774 --> 41:11.648
Someone hired him.

41:11.984 --> 41:13.858
He's still out there.

41:14.112 --> 41:15.985
And how do you feel about that?

41:17.323 --> 41:20.609
I will be able to answer that question
eventually.

41:21.077 --> 41:22.322
When?

41:22.578 --> 41:24.737
After I track them down.

41:25.331 --> 41:26.790
Hey, guys.

41:28.459 --> 41:31.638
- What is it?
- This case isn't over yet.

41:31.662 --> 41:33.557
I just found a local address
on Keelson.

41:33.581 --> 41:35.500
- Where?
- Downtown.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.104
Could be a safe house.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.151
I checked out
its electronic signature.

41:39.175 --> 41:43.698
Looks like this place is filled
with some heavy-duty data servers.

41:43.722 --> 41:45.801
And I think we've got the key.

41:49.522 --> 41:51.230
Data means answers.
