WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:05.047
- Thanks. Is it cold out there!
- I know, it's freezing.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.924
Come on in. Sit by the fire.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.343
I'll make you both a drink
and then we can talk.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.677
- About what?
- Antennas up.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.346
Aye, aye, Captain.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.556
So, Lorelai, how are you?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.517
I'm fine, Mom.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.894
- Rory?
- I'm fine, too, Grandma.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.605
- How are you, Mom?
- Also fine.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.650
Look at that, all three of us fine,
just like the Judds.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.152
So, Lorelai, are you dating?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.073
No, I'm not dating.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.034
- Really? There's no one at all?
- No, I'm totally single.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.329
- Any chance you'll get back with Max?
- No, Mom, there's no chance.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.831
What about the man at the diner
who refuses to shave?

00:39.873 --> 00:43.126
- Luke is just a friend.
- You think you'll be single your entire life?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.169
Excuse me?

00:44.253 --> 00:47.589
In terms of your finding someone,
what do you think the odds are?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.299
Okay, what is going on?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.427
I visited the family mausoleum today.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.179
Never what you think it's gonna be.

00:54.263 --> 00:57.516
I just wanted to check on things,
make sure they were keeping it up...

00:57.599 --> 00:58.684
changing the flowers.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.937
So I went inside and looked around,
and it occurred to me...

01:02.020 --> 01:04.188
that there's a very limited space there.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.443
Now, of course, there's a slot open
for me, Richard, you, and Rory.

01:08.527 --> 01:12.197
But after the two of you, that's it.
No more room for anyone else.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.490
Yes.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.035
So if you actually do meet
someone someday...

01:17.077 --> 01:18.537
I don't know where to put him.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.540
Maybe we could just dump him
at the local pool hall.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.418
- Don't be silly.
- 'Cause this is not a conversation for that.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.587
We can't expand into the crypt next door...

01:26.670 --> 01:29.214
because the family that owns it
won't even discuss it.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.716
I'm getting a little creeped out.

01:30.757 --> 01:34.970
So I talked to the head of the cemetery,
and he suggested that we buy an annex.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.221
- An annex?
- Yes.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.975
Like an outlet store. It would specialize
in the irregular family members.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.896
If we do get the annex, and you do
eventually, someday, get married...

01:43.979 --> 01:45.606
Just say 'fat chance,' will you?

01:45.689 --> 01:48.317
I just meant
we'll have to decide who to move.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.239
Why don't we move Aunt Cecile?
She was always annoying at parties.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.241
- She loved the 'knock, knock' jokes.
- Mom!

01:56.283 --> 01:58.493
- What?
- You can't just kick out Aunt Cecile.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.289
'Knock, knock. ' 'Who's there?'
'Pineapple. ' 'Pineapple who?'

02:02.456 --> 02:05.459
That's where it ended.
Never fully grasped its concept.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.920
She was a complete idiot.
Okay, it's decided. Cecile goes.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.839
Look, put me in the annex.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.218
You are not leaving me alone
in there with Cecile.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.469
I won't be held responsible...

02:15.552 --> 02:18.430
for somebody being kicked out of
their eternal resting place.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.224
I have an idea. I'll probably go first.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.852
- Throw Rory in with me later.
- I'd like my own space, if you don't mind.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.355
Why? It'd totally be fun
to be there together.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.483
I plan to be buried with all the good CDs
and my 'rock star' belt.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.276
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

02:31.318 --> 02:34.112
We were just discussing
who to move to the annex.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.951
I vote for Cecile. Horrible woman.
And those terrible jokes.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.037
- What did I tell you?
- This is a cold, cold family.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.677 --> 03:41.346
- This is really good.
- Yeah. What is it?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.183
- No, don't tell us.
- Why not?

03:44.266 --> 03:47.394
Every time I've had something great,
but didn't know what it was...

03:47.477 --> 03:51.648
it turned out to be something disgusting
that I wouldn't have tried in the first place.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.483
- Example?
- Snails.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.652
- Gross.
- Eat in ignorance and enjoy.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.695
Gladly.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.449
- So, Dad, how's retired life treating you?
- Fascinating, actually.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.743
I find myself noticing things.

04:02.826 --> 04:06.038
Everyday things that I must have
witnessed a hundred times before...

04:06.121 --> 04:07.664
and just walked right past.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.335
Like yesterday, your mother
moved a vase, the one in the hall.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.003
And she didn't do it in front of me.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.714
No, 'cause nice girls never move vases
in front of men.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.548
And she only moved it a little...

04:17.632 --> 04:20.719
but as I passed it by,
I noticed it had been moved.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.013
- Impressive.
- Every day's a new discovery.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.640
Your mother changed her hair...

04:24.723 --> 04:27.809
or she wore shoes
that didn't match her purse.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.437
- Last Thursday.
- For heaven's sake.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.105
- You know what else I noticed?
- What?

04:32.189 --> 04:33.732
A first-edition Flaubert...

04:33.815 --> 04:37.277
mint condition, shoved behind
several of my Churchill biographies.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.654
- No.
- Interested?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.906
- My life is good.
- Follow me.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.451
See if you can find the new
Chanel patent leather pirate boots...

04:44.535 --> 04:46.745
stuffed back behind your Churchills.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.040
What's up, Mom?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.376
- Nothing's up.
- You were twitching. I saw you.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.585
You did not.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.421
When Dad talked about the vase,
you pulled a full-on Tabitha.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.298
- I did not.
- Is something wrong?

04:58.382 --> 05:00.133
No, nothing's wrong.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.261
Okay. Nothing's wrong.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.098
It's just that things
are a little strange lately.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.225
- What is?
- Having him home.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.477
We've never really been home
at the same time.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.564
We got married, went to Europe,
we came back, he went to work...

05:13.647 --> 05:16.483
- and it's been that way ever since.
- So now it's different.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.069
It's very different. He's always here...

05:19.152 --> 05:22.447
watching me and noticing
when I move a vase, and...

05:22.990 --> 05:25.534
I don't know. It's silly.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.663
So he noticed my hair was different.
Women die for that sort of thing.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.331
Mom, it's just an adjustment.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.501
You guys just need to figure out
a new routine.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.212
- I guess so.
- It'll just take some time.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.755
Then you'll find your rhythm...

05:38.839 --> 05:41.216
he'll go back to ignoring your hair.
All will be well.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.635
- Yes, you're probably right.
- I am right.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.929
Okay, I give. What is this?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.139
Sweetbreads.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.225
- Sweetbreads. So that's...
- Pancreas.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.688
No!

05:59.026 --> 06:00.444
- Paris.
- I'm not done.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.820
- Sorry.
- No.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.865
- Glad she finished that one.
- Why am I the only one who cares?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.742
You're not the only one who cares.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.286
I know you do,
but everyone in this room should care...

06:09.369 --> 06:11.747
because I can't be the only one to care,
besides you.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.082
It's just a contest.
It's not like you get a car...

06:14.166 --> 06:17.252
- or a lifetime supply of Rice-A-Roni.
- God, I love that stuff.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.923
The Oppenheimer Award for Excellence
in school journalism is not a contest.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.091
It's a statement. It says you're the best.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.594
The best writers, best reporters,
best editors.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.847
It says you've crushed all others
who have dared to take you on.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.975
It says that every other school
in the United States of America...

06:32.059 --> 06:34.394
is feeling nothing but shame,
defeat and pain...

06:34.478 --> 06:37.231
because of the people
who won the Oppenheimer plaque.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.234
I want to be those people.
I want to cause that pain.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.860
- Our paper is good.
- Not good enough.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.279
- Last week's issue...
- Was a fine effort by some kids.

06:44.363 --> 06:47.282
- We are a bunch of kids.
- Not when we're in this room.

06:47.366 --> 06:51.537
Lessure Prep Gazette, Broadmouth
Banner, Richmond Heights Chronicle...

06:51.578 --> 06:54.039
these publications
are not our competition.

06:54.581 --> 06:58.252
The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal, The Washington Post...

06:58.335 --> 07:00.796
these publications are our competition.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.341
- Paris has gone bye-bye.
- We need to raise the bar.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.510
We need to be better,
think harder, dig deeper.

07:06.593 --> 07:10.222
I don't want to just submit a good issue,
but a great issue, the best issue.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.932
- When's the deadline?
- Next week.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.476
Okay, so then
we'd better get brainstorming.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.520
- Does anyone have an idea for a theme?
- Yes.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.230
- What?
- The one that wins.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.940
Okay, good. Big help.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.860
All right, everyone,
we should get working.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.739
You're going to give yourself a stroke
one of these days, you know that?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.243
Graciella, I'm leaving the shopping list
on the table here.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.370
Remember, we need
the low-sudsing detergent.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.664
I've drawn a picture
of what the box looks like...

07:35.747 --> 07:38.417
so for heaven's sake,
pay attention this time.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.461
How was your walk?

07:41.545 --> 07:43.380
Carl Anderson needs a new roof.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.674
- I'm gonna drop him a note.
- Good idea.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.342
- Busy day?
- Very.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.887
Is that the same cup of coffee
you had when I left?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.639
When I left an hour ago,
you were having coffee.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.266
No, this is a different cup.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.435
So that's your third cup of coffee
this morning.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.437
- I guess.
- Interesting.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.440
I just realized you have
three cups of coffee in the morning.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.025
Not every morning.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.985
- Every morning this week.
- So what?

08:05.068 --> 08:07.863
Nothing. Just an observation, that's all.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.074
Lot of coffee to drink, early in the morning.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.119
Any thoughts
on what you'd like for dinner tonight?

08:14.203 --> 08:15.704
- No, anything's fine.
- All right.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.123
- What are you writing down?
- Lamb chops.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.209
- Is that for tonight?
- Yes.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.588
- Do you not want lamb chops tonight?
- No, lamb chops is fine for tonight.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.508
I just thought a nice roast
would also be nice for a change.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.843
- Roast it is.
- Of course, if you want lamb chops...

08:29.927 --> 08:32.304
- We're having roast.
- Okay, if that is what you want.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.015
Do you want me to drop off
anything at the dry cleaner's?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.308
- You're going there?
- Yes.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.601
I'll go with you.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.812
- I can bring in whatever you have.
- But it'd be nice to go together.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.941
It would be romantic,
but I won't have time to get back here...

08:43.982 --> 08:46.860
before my DAR meeting.
Probably better if I went alone.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.737
You can come with me next week.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.822
But I can go to the meeting with you.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.076
To my meeting of the
Daughters of the American Revolution?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.078
I think it'd be fascinating.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.330
I go straight from there
to the symphony luncheon.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.832
I'll tag along there, too.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.750
But from there, I get my hair done.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.253
You don't want to sit around
while I have my hair done.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.963
- No, I don't.
- There you go.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.506
You can cancel that.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.133
I get my hair done
every Wednesday at 3:00.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.802
Your hair looks fine.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.221
Because I have my hair done
every Wednesday at 3:00.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.389
What am I going to do?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.850
- Why don't you go to the club?
- What?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.184
Yes, the club.

09:19.268 --> 09:22.688
You spend a fortune to belong there,
and you never got to go much before.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.315
- Why don't you go there now?
- On a Wednesday afternoon?

09:25.399 --> 09:26.733
I think it would be perfect.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.111
I don't even know what they do
on a Wednesday.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.821
No time like the present to find out.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.699
- All right, I'll go to the club.
- Wonderful.

09:35.284 --> 09:38.120
Going to the club
on a Wednesday afternoon.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.082
Life certainly is
an interesting game of cards, isn't it?

09:42.166 --> 09:43.584
It certainly is.

09:44.042 --> 09:47.254
I'll see you tonight.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.881
Have a good time.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.594
Graciella, I need more coffee now.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.179
How about a triple feature?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.681
Three Days of the Condor,
The Show, and The Jerk.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.601
- The Show is 9.5 hours.
- The Jerk is short.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.978
The three faces of Costner: Bull Durham...

10:03.061 --> 10:04.688
Dances with Wolves, The Postman.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.357
Tom Petty playing Tom Petty,
that big speech about:

10:07.441 --> 10:09.735
'Once upon a time,
there was a thing called mail. '

10:09.776 --> 10:12.112
It'll make you laugh, cry,
or mail something.

10:12.196 --> 10:15.157
Or we could do
a Ruth Gordon film festival.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.368
Harold and Maude, Rosemary's Baby,
and that great episode of Taxi.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.662
Got it. The worst film festival ever:

10:20.746 --> 10:22.956
Cool as Ice, Hudson Hawk,
and Electric Boogaloo.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.249
- Sold.
- I'll get the Hawk.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.876
I'll get the Boogaloo.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.589
- See? I told you.
- Wow!

10:30.672 --> 10:33.342
- Guys, can I get in there?
- Yeah.

10:39.223 --> 10:42.267
- Got it, plus four boxes of red vines.
- Let's go.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.603
- Hi, Kirk.
- Evening, Lorelai.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.940
I forgot my card at home,
but I think my number's 6247.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.983
- You forgot your card?
- I might have lost it.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.111
- Lost it? Was it temporary or laminated?
- Laminated.

10:53.195 --> 10:56.406
- You lost a permanent card.
- You can just get me a new card.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.034
I hope you understand
the gravity of the situation.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.118
I'm trying to grasp it.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.328
These cards are agreements.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.789
It's an agreement
between you and the video store...

11:03.872 --> 11:07.042
stating that you will take care
of your card, honor your card...

11:07.125 --> 11:08.794
- you'll be nice to your card...
- Kirk.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.337
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.383
Hello? Reception sucks here.
I'll be right back.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.344
It'll be ready in a minute.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.721
There were a couple of
little kids over there...

11:19.805 --> 11:22.349
and they were looking at this tape
that's kind of mature.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.643
You might want to put that stuff
on a higher shelf.

11:24.726 --> 11:25.769
How mature?

11:25.853 --> 11:28.689
It's a half-naked woman
just standing there.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.524
- Is she a blonde?
- What?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.192
I'll check it out right now.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.111
Mom, I can hear you now. What's up?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.988
- You have to take your father.
- What?

11:36.071 --> 11:38.490
Tomorrow, for the whole day.
Just take him.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.117
- Take him where?
- I don't care.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.870
The zoo, the mall, Rhode Island.
Get him out of my house.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.165
- What happened?
- He's joining my water aerobics class.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.375
- What?
- He bought some new swim trunks.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.543
He's out of control.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.212
- Okay, Mom, calm down.
- I can't calm down.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.841
I can't turn around without him being
there, following me, staring at me.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.801
- He likes you.
- Don't be cute.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.428
The man is driving me insane.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.723
I am going to go insane.
If you don't help me, I'll take you with me.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.683
Okay, I would like to help you...

12:04.766 --> 12:06.185
- You owe me.
- What?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.811
I pay for Rory's school.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.230
- Are you serious?
- And I cosigned your loan.

12:10.314 --> 12:13.025
- You have a house because of me.
- Are you hearing yourself?

12:13.066 --> 12:16.361
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.
I just need one day of peace.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.488
And I will do anything to get it. Anything.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.658
Okay. Mom, fine. I'll take him.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.994
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.537
Emily, where are you?

12:25.621 --> 12:29.166
- I have to go. Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning. Bye.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.173
Oh, my God.
The most horrible thing happened.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.967
Headmaster Charleston's office called.
He's been kidnapped.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.428
Two guys broke in,
threw him in a Hefty bag...

12:41.512 --> 12:43.305
used those twisty ties and carted him off.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.432
Classes have been canceled
until further notice.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.850
I'm going to school.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.604
Rory, come on. It's just one day.
I'll write you a note.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.106
'Dear Nazis,
Rory had to miss school today...

12:53.190 --> 12:56.401
'to save her mom from spending
the entire day with her father...

12:56.485 --> 12:58.403
'who looks at her
like she has three heads. '

12:58.445 --> 12:59.571
Out of my way, please.

12:59.655 --> 13:03.909
Do you know the last time my father
and I were alone for any period of time?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.911
I was kicked out of summer camp...

13:05.994 --> 13:08.163
for refusing to call
the camp counselor 'Peaches. '

13:08.247 --> 13:12.209
I thought the entire concept of counselors
choosing summer-fruit names was stupid.

13:12.251 --> 13:14.837
So they called my dad,
and he came to get me...

13:14.920 --> 13:17.756
and it was just the two of us
alone in the car, from Maine...

13:17.798 --> 13:20.133
with nothing to talk about
but my camp failure.

13:20.217 --> 13:24.054
Luckily, I had also flashed the swim team,
or even that would have gotten stale.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.014
I have The Franklin today. I cannot miss it.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.432
Rory, please.

13:27.599 --> 13:31.019
I can't handle the entire day with him.
I can't.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.357
Mom, I promise.
Just make it till the afternoon...

13:35.440 --> 13:38.360
and I promise I'll come home
and take grandpa off your hands.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.445
- It'll be fine.
- It is not going to be fine.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.822
It's going to be horrible.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.533
It is going to be a bad,
depressing Lifetime movie...

13:44.616 --> 13:47.077
and Nancy McKeon will be playing me.
I am Jo.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.787
And that would be him.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.831
It's not going to be that bad.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.751
Be nice.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.378
Very good.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.630
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Grandpa.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.174
Good morning, girls.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.928
Did you have any trouble coming?

14:05.012 --> 14:06.680
Not at all. The directions were fine.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.641
- I'll see you this afternoon.
- I look forward to it.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.935
Have fun.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.655
- So, good drive?
- Very good.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.034
Here.

14:33.749 --> 14:36.043
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'm fine.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.714
- Do you want coffee?
- Yes. God, yes. Thank you.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.467
Sure you don't...

14:43.675 --> 14:45.302
Coffee? No.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.015
Can I offer you anything else?

14:50.098 --> 14:53.644
Some Pop-Tarts, or...
That's pretty much it.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.356
You don't have to entertain me, Lorelai.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.484
I just came here to see you
and your house and your town.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.736
You don't have to do
anything special for me.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.905
- But you're my guest.
- No, I'm your father.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.157
Just do whatever it is
you normally would do.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.951
What I would normally do?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.161
Yes, like for instance, this morning...

15:11.245 --> 15:13.956
if I wasn't here, you would wake up...

15:14.456 --> 15:17.417
obviously get some coffee, and then what?

15:18.502 --> 15:20.796
I'd probably read the paper
for a little while...

15:20.879 --> 15:22.047
and then have some breakfast.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.384
- Let's read the paper, then.
- Okay. Let's read the paper.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.891
- What sections would you like?
- You go first.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.893
- I'll take what's left.
- Okay.

15:34.935 --> 15:39.398
Normally, I read the Arts & Leisure
and the Lifestyles.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.649
Perfect.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.402
That leaves Business, Sports,
and World News.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.115
- That worked out well.
- Yes, it did, didn't it?

15:51.410 --> 15:54.037
Well, this is it. Luke's.

15:54.121 --> 15:58.709
You know, when I was in college,
there was this horrible little diner...

15:58.834 --> 16:00.627
across from my apartment building.

16:00.711 --> 16:03.380
It was run by this terrible little couple.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.257
They were very angry.

16:05.299 --> 16:08.343
They would fight, break plates, curse.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.972
And I went in there every morning
for three years...

16:12.055 --> 16:15.058
and I had the most dreadful breakfasts.
Just awful.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.768
I really miss that place.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.771
- Morning.
- Luke, you remember my father.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.732
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.067
- Quite a place you've got here.
- It pays the bills.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.777
Always a plus in business.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.363
- Dad, do you know what you want?
- I already ate.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.740
You did? When?

16:29.781 --> 16:32.451
I had breakfast at home.
I get up at 5:30 every morning.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.494
Wow. Why?

16:33.577 --> 16:36.246
I've gotten up at 5:30
for as long as I can remember.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.791
That was when you had to work.
You can afford to get a little crazy.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.836
- Get up at 5:45.
- Go ahead and order, Lorelai.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.048
I'll have the banana pancakes,
side of bacon, and lots of coffee.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.466
Coming right up.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.094
- You didn't order any grapefruit.
- I don't like grapefruit.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.639
I always start my breakfast
with half a grapefruit.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.432
Do the Florida people know about you?

16:55.474 --> 16:58.519
Anita Bryant left this huge gap
that has yet to be filled.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.230
It's important
to start the day off correctly.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.981
A grapefruit is brain food.

17:03.023 --> 17:07.069
It has vitamin C and folic acid,
and it helps with your digestion.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.821
- It really is a terrific fruit.
- I feel like you're about to break into song.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.492
- I'm serious about this.
- But I still don't like grapefruit.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.119
There are many things in life
that we don't like...

17:17.204 --> 17:19.957
but their benefits far outweigh
the temporary discomforts...

17:19.998 --> 17:22.584
- we have to endure.
- Hold on a sec.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.589
- I need a grapefruit.
- What?

17:27.673 --> 17:30.425
Before my pancakes this morning,
I need half a grapefruit...

17:30.509 --> 17:32.386
preferably one that tastes like a doughnut.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.221
- I don't have grapefruit.
- How come?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.807
- I've never had grapefruit.
- I need a...

17:36.849 --> 17:39.643
Listen. I have my father with me all day.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.312
So far, there's been no major drama,
yelling, ugliness...

17:42.396 --> 17:46.191
but there will be if I don't find a way
to get half a grapefruit for breakfast.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.152
I could go next door to Doose's
and buy a grapefruit.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.488
- I'd be eternally grateful.
- I'll be right back.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.656
Thank you.

17:57.536 --> 18:01.373
- Okay, the grapefruit is coming.
- You won't be sorry.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.792
So, listen, I was thinking...

18:04.084 --> 18:07.296
maybe after we're done here,
you might like to walk around town...

18:07.379 --> 18:10.674
see the sights, and Rory usually
gets home around 4:00.

18:10.716 --> 18:13.218
The two of you could hang out
until I get off work...

18:13.260 --> 18:15.929
the three of us could meet for dinner.
How does that sound?

18:16.013 --> 18:18.807
- Very sensible.
- I had to make up for my shoes.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.144
- Is that your second cup of coffee?
- Third. Why?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.312
No reason.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.400
It's a lot of coffee,
first thing in the morning.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.324
- You've got to stop doing that.
- I've been doing some research...

18:35.407 --> 18:37.659
on the Oppenheimer Award
and noticed something.

18:37.743 --> 18:41.288
The winning schools had an extremely
strong human-interest story on page 1.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.166
That's what we need.
We've got the teen issues down...

18:44.249 --> 18:47.085
a decent op-ed and political page,
but human interest?

18:47.169 --> 18:48.921
- That's what we're missing.
- Ideas?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.047
- Yes.
- Do tell.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.674
According to the papers,
there's been a huge increase...

18:52.758 --> 18:55.928
in the number of families fleeing
the major cities for small towns.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.263
Hundreds of thousands
of city-slicking yuppies...

18:58.305 --> 19:01.308
carting the trophy wife and asthmatic kids
off to small towns...

19:01.391 --> 19:02.559
in search of the simple life.

19:02.601 --> 19:06.730
- Milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself.
- Interesting.

19:06.772 --> 19:09.858
And I thought about it.
There's a romantic aspect to small towns.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.110
White picket fences, low crime rate...

19:12.194 --> 19:15.572
smaller classrooms, better tomatoes.
It all seems perfect.

19:15.614 --> 19:17.824
But nothing is perfect. Nothing is safe.

19:17.908 --> 19:21.286
Nothing is ever what it seems.
And then it hit me. Our story.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.873
We're going to blow the lid off
the seedy underbelly of small-town life...

19:24.957 --> 19:27.292
- starting with yours.
- Stars Hollow?

19:27.835 --> 19:31.296
You're going to uncover
the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow?

19:31.421 --> 19:33.632
Stars Hollow doesn't have
a seedy underbelly.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.175
We don't even have a meter maid.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.636
You may be blind to it
because you live there...

19:37.678 --> 19:40.264
but it's there and it's ugly,
and I'm going to find it.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.641
- I'll meet you out front after school.
- Not today.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.142
Why not? You hiding something?

19:44.226 --> 19:46.395
I promised to help my mom
with something.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.730
Help her tomorrow. We have work to do.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.858
This could be our chance to nail this.

19:50.941 --> 19:54.278
I have a hunch there's a good story here,
and I'm going to find it.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.446
I was even going to share
a byline with you.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.365
But if you want to bail out, that's fine.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.950
Am I meeting you or not?

19:59.992 --> 20:02.161
I don't think you're gonna find anything.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.038
Then the worst that can happen
is I spend time in your town...

20:05.122 --> 20:07.499
and have an urge
to enter a pie in the county fair.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.960
I'll meet you out front. Don't be late.

20:12.421 --> 20:16.175
As soon as I can,
I will send someone up. Yes, I will.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.011
I understand.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.312
I understand. Goodbye.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.731
- What do you understand?
- I have no idea.

20:30.814 --> 20:32.816
I tuned them out at the first screech.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.819
- Have we heard from Manny yet?
- No, and I have paged him twice.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.655
We only have enough linen
for one seating. Hand me the phone.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.241
Plus, we are completely out
of clean towels.

20:43.869 --> 20:46.705
Hi, Sophie, it's Lorelai.
I need to talk to Manny.

20:46.747 --> 20:48.540
When will he be back?

20:48.707 --> 20:51.835
Okay, I need him to call me really soon.
Like five minutes ago.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.171
Okay. Thanks. We need a backup plan.

20:54.213 --> 20:57.132
Call Patty's and see if she has
any party-rental tablecloths...

20:57.216 --> 20:59.426
and then pull all the towels
from the pool...

20:59.510 --> 21:01.887
and call Gandalfi's
and order a case of champagne.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.139
Send a bottle to every room
that's towelless.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.266
Page him every two minutes. No!

21:06.350 --> 21:08.435
Hi, Dad. What are you doing?

21:08.519 --> 21:11.730
- I thought you were gonna tour the town.
- I did.

21:11.897 --> 21:14.900
I went into all the stores.
The cat one, twice.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.819
And then I walked around a little,
and then I was done.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.531
- What about the park? See the park?
- Yes, I saw the park.

21:20.572 --> 21:23.700
What about the giant slinky?
We're mighty proud of that.

21:23.909 --> 21:27.412
I saw the slinky, yes,
and the 100-year-old oak tree...

21:27.746 --> 21:29.581
and the life-size yarn person.

21:29.665 --> 21:33.585
I even stopped by your house and had
Babbette introduce me to all her gnomes.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.755
And then I realized the only thing
I had not seen...

21:36.880 --> 21:38.090
is my daughter at work.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.676
Watching me at work
is not very interesting. Trust me.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.427
You underestimate yourself.

21:42.511 --> 21:45.222
Okay, there's books
on the shelves over there.

21:45.264 --> 21:46.765
I have my newspaper. I'm fine.

21:46.807 --> 21:48.725
All right, I'm just gonna...

21:48.809 --> 21:50.978
- What's the matter?
- Is your jacket in the back?

21:51.061 --> 21:53.772
- Your work jacket.
- I don't have a work jacket.

21:53.856 --> 21:55.607
- That's your working outfit?
- Yeah.

21:55.649 --> 21:56.733
And your boss doesn't mind?

21:56.817 --> 21:59.570
Considering my boss is me,
no, she doesn't.

21:59.611 --> 22:02.906
She did at first, but then I bought
her a cup of coffee, I realized...

22:02.948 --> 22:06.034
all the hostility she was expressing
toward me was just jealousy.

22:06.118 --> 22:09.079
We've been best friends ever since.
Take a seat, Dad.

22:10.539 --> 22:12.833
Will you get me an extra bottle
of champagne...

22:12.916 --> 22:15.627
- and smack me over the head with it?
- Absolutely.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.004
Independence Inn.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.298
Sit down, breathe,
remember you're at work...

22:19.381 --> 22:22.342
- so screaming and crying is not an option.
- What are you doing?

22:22.426 --> 22:24.720
- I can't meet you after school.
- What? You promised.

22:24.803 --> 22:29.433
I have to work on a story for The Franklin.
I tried to get out of it, but couldn't.

22:29.474 --> 22:30.893
- Great.
- I'm sorry.

22:30.976 --> 22:33.687
No. School comes before
Mommy's mental health.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.064
Tell Grandpa to wander around for a while.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.941
- He already did.
- Did he see the slinky?

22:37.983 --> 22:41.945
Yes, he saw the slinky. He's here now.
He hates my shirt.

22:41.987 --> 22:44.239
Give him a book,
have Sookie make him lunch...

22:44.323 --> 22:47.868
I swear I'll be home by dinner,
and you won't have to say a word.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.957
- I think I got rabies.
- It's just a bus.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.792
- It smelled.
- Like a bus.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.544
I'll have to burn my clothes.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.838
You have a car. We could have driven.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.965
We have to get the feel
of the small-town world.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.468
We won't get the feel of a small town
in a BMW.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.971
- Is there something crawling in my hair?
- Where do you want to go?

23:08.055 --> 23:10.557
I don't know.
Where's the bad part of town?

23:10.724 --> 23:12.142
- Over there.
- What?

23:12.601 --> 23:15.729
People. They're very upset
with the color of that fence.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.981
This is the town, Paris.

23:18.023 --> 23:21.026
It's not seedy, it's not run-down.
It's just Stars Hollow.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.028
- Where's the local bar?
- In Woodbridge.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.613
- Why aren't you helping?
- I'm trying.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.615
You're looking for something
that's not here.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.617
- What's this?
- Luke's Diner.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.161
Diner? Okay, good.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.546
What are you doing?

23:40.629 --> 23:42.965
Trying just to blend in,
fade away, observe.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.384
- Rory, coffee?
- Thanks, Luke.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.970
- Who's your friend?
- Angela Lansbury.

23:48.053 --> 23:50.472
- You're the owner here?
- Yes. Want some coffee?

23:50.556 --> 23:53.350
- No, thanks. So, you run the diner?
- Oh, boy.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.103
- You get a lot of truckers through here?
- Truckers?

23:56.186 --> 23:59.064
Guys on the road for weeks,
lonely, looking for company...

23:59.106 --> 24:00.190
a little pick-me-up?

24:00.274 --> 24:02.901
- What's she talking about?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

24:02.985 --> 24:05.529
It's common knowledge
that diners are breeding grounds...

24:05.571 --> 24:07.573
- for prostitution and drug dealers.
- What?

24:07.614 --> 24:09.324
Have you ever seen anything like that?

24:09.408 --> 24:11.869
What about that guy over there?
What's his story?

24:11.910 --> 24:13.203
Reverend Nichols?

24:13.245 --> 24:15.455
Reverend Nichols?
Is that like Dr. Feelgood?

24:15.539 --> 24:18.041
- How much do you like her?
- Do what you got to do.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.502
Where did he come from?
What's up there?

24:20.586 --> 24:23.547
Is that where you keep the girls?
You got a little cathouse?

24:23.589 --> 24:25.549
I think she got you, Uncle Luke.
Give up now.

24:25.591 --> 24:26.967
Do not add to this insanity.

24:27.050 --> 24:30.846
An innocent boy like me should not
be raised in an atmosphere like this.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.890
I want to be good.
Life's just not letting me.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.725
- Get her out of here.
- Okay. Let's go.

24:34.766 --> 24:37.227
Why do you need me to leave?
What have you got to hide?

24:37.269 --> 24:38.979
Paris, let's go.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.274
- We're aware of it.
- We're working on it.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.360
As soon as the towels arrive,
your room will get the first one.

24:45.444 --> 24:47.237
No one gets a towel before you do.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.323
Did you get
the complimentary champagne?

24:49.406 --> 24:51.617
Just open the champagne
and drink, relax, enjoy.

24:51.700 --> 24:52.951
Of course it's free.

24:53.035 --> 24:55.704
- We'll call you soon.
- Talk to you soon.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.789
- I'm killing Manny.
- I'm helping.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.542
I'm gonna strangle him
with one of his own towels.

25:00.626 --> 25:02.544
- Lorelai?
- Yeah, Dad?

25:02.628 --> 25:05.172
You realize there are no tablecloths
in the dining room?

25:05.255 --> 25:07.716
I do. We're having a problem
with our linen delivery.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.468
It doesn't look very professional.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.970
- It's Manny.
- I have to take this, Dad.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.016
Manny, my mysterious man,
where have you been?

25:16.308 --> 25:18.852
Me, Manny?
I'm just a desperate woman. Yes.

25:18.936 --> 25:22.523
I know you have many problems,
but I have to have some towels or linens...

25:22.606 --> 25:26.318
or I'm gonna be lying on the street,
talking about the inn I used to work at.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.237
You don't want that, do you?

25:29.112 --> 25:31.824
Anything you can do
to get me through the night.

25:33.158 --> 25:36.829
Manny, I love you. You rock.
I am devoted to you.

25:36.912 --> 25:40.082
I'm never gonna look at another towel
without thinking of you.

25:40.165 --> 25:41.667
Thank you. Bye, stud.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.128
- He'll be here in 20 minutes.
- Lorelai.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.006
- Yes, Dad?
- May I speak to you for a moment?

25:48.298 --> 25:50.300
Someone is in trouble.

25:52.177 --> 25:53.637
Is something wrong, Dad?

25:53.679 --> 25:56.431
Was that a business call
I just overheard there?

25:56.515 --> 25:58.225
That was my linen delivery guy.

25:58.308 --> 26:01.895
- So it was a business call?
- Yes, it was a business call.

26:01.979 --> 26:03.939
And that's how you handle a business call?

26:04.022 --> 26:06.024
I've known Manny for 10 years, Dad.

26:06.108 --> 26:07.818
I don't care how long you've known him.

26:07.860 --> 26:10.153
You never talk to a business associate
like that...

26:10.195 --> 26:12.573
- especially not one that you employ.
- Okay, Dad.

26:12.656 --> 26:15.325
- These people have to respect you.
- He does respect me.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.660
You were flirting with him.

26:16.702 --> 26:20.539
I said what I had to say in order to get
the linen before somebody else did...

26:20.581 --> 26:23.167
- and I did, so I won.
- This isn't about winning.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.045
This is about proper procedure.
You need to listen to me, Lorelai.

26:27.087 --> 26:30.966
If there is one thing I know about,
it is the correct way to conduct yourself...

26:31.049 --> 26:32.384
in a position of authority.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.053
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

26:36.930 --> 26:39.850
Because I'm only telling you this
for your own good.

26:41.476 --> 26:43.562
All right. Go back to work.

26:44.188 --> 26:46.315
I'll be right here if you need me.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.609
Okey-dokey.

26:58.410 --> 27:01.371
Nothing. Not even a cigarette butt
on the ground.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.916
This town would make Frank Capra
want to throw up.

27:03.957 --> 27:07.878
- Sorry, I tried to tell you.
- I know. It's just I was so sure.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.922
We'll think of something else
to write about.

27:10.005 --> 27:14.009
- We're not going to lose.
- There she is. The girl of the moment.

27:14.176 --> 27:17.554
- You, young lady, are my hero.
- Why is that, Taylor?

27:17.596 --> 27:18.972
Because in this day and age...

27:19.056 --> 27:22.643
when the kids are willy-nilly
with their clothes, hair and morals...

27:22.726 --> 27:27.022
it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl
like you still exists.

27:27.105 --> 27:30.400
A girl who has the gumption and guts
to stand up and say:

27:30.442 --> 27:33.904
'Why are we allowing this trash out
where all our children can see it?'

27:33.987 --> 27:36.824
- And a few selected adults also.
- What are you talking about?

27:36.907 --> 27:40.285
Come on in and see for yourself.

27:41.954 --> 27:43.539
What happened? Where is everything?

27:43.622 --> 27:45.958
Thanks to your brilliant suggestion...

27:46.041 --> 27:49.795
they are all safely stashed
behind 'the Rory curtain. '

27:49.837 --> 27:52.798
- The what?
- It seemed fitting to name it after you.

27:52.881 --> 27:56.009
No. I don't want a Rory curtain.
I never asked for it.

27:56.093 --> 27:58.887
You told me to put that movie
where the kids couldn't see it.

27:58.971 --> 28:00.347
You did?

28:00.430 --> 28:04.184
I just meant to put it on a higher shelf,
not to get fabric involved.

28:04.268 --> 28:06.895
This is much better than a higher shelf.

28:06.979 --> 28:09.314
Now all the movies
that we deem objectionable...

28:09.398 --> 28:12.276
will be safely hidden
from the eyes of the children.

28:12.317 --> 28:15.487
Plus, it'll make adults think twice
before they go back there.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.489
No. I did not mean to do this.

28:17.573 --> 28:18.907
What are you doing?

28:18.991 --> 28:20.117
- This is it.
- What?

28:20.200 --> 28:23.162
Our story.
Censorship in a small town. It's perfect.

28:23.245 --> 28:25.372
You know I don't believe in censorship.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.583
Even better.
'Small-town minds run amok. '

28:27.666 --> 28:30.377
This is genius. It's gold.
We're going to win.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.714
Taylor, on the record,
how long have you been working here?

28:35.299 --> 28:37.009
Rory, we're home.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.595
Next time, stop the car completely
before you get out.

28:39.678 --> 28:42.139
- Rory, for the love of God, be home.
- I'm here.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.683
Sorry. I was on the phone. How was your...

28:44.808 --> 28:48.520
I don't think I've ever loved you
quite as much as I love you right now.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.814
Ribs cracking. Organs crushing.

28:50.856 --> 28:52.482
Yeah, well, love hurts.

28:55.152 --> 28:57.446
- Lovely to see you, Rory.
- How was your day?

28:57.529 --> 28:58.864
It was very pleasant.

28:58.947 --> 29:01.408
- I heard you saw Mom in action.
- Yes, he did.

29:01.492 --> 29:05.037
- She's great, isn't she?
- She's spirited.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.955
- Spirited.
- Spirited is nice.

29:07.164 --> 29:09.875
Let's talk dinner. How about Chinese?

29:09.917 --> 29:12.753
- Very spirited food.
- Do you like Chinese food?

29:12.836 --> 29:14.838
If prepared properly, I like it very much.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.216
- I'll go call Al's.
- Al's?

29:17.591 --> 29:19.259
Al's Pancake World.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.929
I thought you said
we were having Chinese food.

29:22.012 --> 29:24.097
Al's has the best Egg Foo Young
in Stars Hollow.

29:24.181 --> 29:26.308
Is that saying anything?

29:26.391 --> 29:30.145
Rory, come entertain your grandpa
while your spirited mommy orders, please.

29:30.229 --> 29:33.357
Grandpa, do you want to see my room?

29:33.690 --> 29:35.150
Yes, I would.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.906
- $20 if you lock him in there.
- $30 if you chill.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.243
- Interesting.
- What are you doing?

29:44.326 --> 29:46.870
There are some holes
in your collection here...

29:46.912 --> 29:49.081
and I'm just making a list to fill them.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.375
These aren't all of my books.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.254
My goodness.

29:56.213 --> 29:57.214
And...

30:03.136 --> 30:06.765
Possibly, I should concentrate on
acquiring you a bookcase first.

30:06.849 --> 30:09.518
That's okay. I kind of like my system.

30:09.601 --> 30:11.353
- Organized chaos?
- Exactly.

30:11.436 --> 30:12.896
Very well. Carry on.

30:14.189 --> 30:18.151
I'm glad not to see
any death rockers on your walls.

30:18.235 --> 30:20.320
Where did you learn the term
'death rockers'?

30:20.404 --> 30:23.782
I'm not entirely unfamiliar
with the music world in which you live.

30:23.866 --> 30:26.410
I don't exactly live in the death-rock world.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.453
If I do move there, I will send you a card.

30:28.537 --> 30:29.955
I appreciate that.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.958
- Harvard.
- Yeah.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.294
We started the obsession board
a few years ago.

30:35.377 --> 30:36.920
When we took that trip to Harvard...

30:37.004 --> 30:39.464
the student store was having
a two-for-one flag sale...

30:39.506 --> 30:42.426
so that sent us into the final stage
of the psychosis.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.845
Hospitals were called,
medications were prescribed.

30:44.928 --> 30:45.929
There is no cure.

30:45.971 --> 30:48.140
Okay, I made the menu for the evening.

30:48.223 --> 30:49.224
My God.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.435
- Looks good.
- Who could eat all that food?

30:51.476 --> 30:53.478
- I almost added the garlic chicken.
- Add it.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.106
- There are only three of us.
- Yes, but we like choices.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.941
Let's call. I'm starved.

31:01.028 --> 31:03.489
Lorelai, you cannot order all that food.

31:03.572 --> 31:06.325
You're teaching your daughter
wastefulness and gluttony.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.951
Dad, we do this all the time.

31:08.035 --> 31:10.245
We order way too much
and eat a third of it...

31:10.329 --> 31:13.123
and eat leftovers for more than a week.
Finely honed system.

31:13.165 --> 31:16.335
Now please just sit
and read something or watch TV.

31:22.216 --> 31:25.010
I noticed all the Harvard paraphernalia
in Rory's room.

31:25.093 --> 31:26.136
Yeah.

31:26.178 --> 31:29.848
You might not want to get her settled
on one specific college quite so soon.

31:29.932 --> 31:31.683
- Why not?
- She's young.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.020
- She hasn't investigated her options.
- She wants to go to Harvard.

31:35.062 --> 31:37.689
- Because she thinks you want her to.
- I do.

31:37.773 --> 31:41.026
There are a lot of other good schools.
You know, I went to Yale.

31:41.109 --> 31:44.154
- Yes, I do know.
- Yale is a very fine school.

31:44.238 --> 31:46.365
Some might argue
a better school than Harvard.

31:46.448 --> 31:49.368
- Some, meaning you?
- I just think Rory should explore it.

31:49.409 --> 31:51.703
I can make some calls,
and set up an appointment.

31:51.745 --> 31:52.955
- No.
- Why not?

31:53.038 --> 31:55.415
- She wants to go to Harvard.
- That's ridiculous.

31:55.499 --> 31:58.710
- Who's going to help her get into Harvard?
- Reese Witherspoon.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.338
I am a Yale alumnus.
I give money to that school.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.090
Getting her in will be a breeze.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.092
We don't like breezes.
They mess up our hair.

32:05.175 --> 32:08.136
- Do not be petulant.
- Do not pick a fight with me.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.889
This is not about you. This is about Rory.

32:10.973 --> 32:13.392
No, this is about Richard interfering.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.394
Please, just let me handle this.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.063
I know more about
the Ivy League system than you do.

32:18.146 --> 32:21.567
- Is that the food already?
- No, sweets, I haven't ordered yet.

32:21.650 --> 32:23.318
- Oh, my God.
- Who is it?

32:28.991 --> 32:31.034
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

32:31.118 --> 32:32.703
- Just standing here.
- Next to?

32:32.786 --> 32:35.164
- A car. Your car.
- No.

32:35.247 --> 32:36.874
- I finished it yesterday.
- You didn't.

32:36.915 --> 32:38.458
Do you want them?

32:39.960 --> 32:42.754
Now, if you don't like it,
I can sell it to someone else.

32:42.796 --> 32:45.382
- Don't you dare.
- Dean, that's amazing.

32:45.424 --> 32:47.926
- Can we drive? Does it drive?
- Does it drive?

32:48.010 --> 32:51.138
I know it drives, but...
I can't believe you finished it.

32:51.221 --> 32:52.222
You built me a car.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.766
Now that the car is done,
will you build me a plane?

32:54.808 --> 32:56.226
One that looks like Shamu?

32:56.268 --> 32:58.478
- He made that car?
- Isn't that incredible?

32:58.562 --> 33:00.772
- She can't accept it.
- Dad, it's okay.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.482
It is not okay. He's a child.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.943
She's not driving a car
a child put together.

33:05.027 --> 33:07.279
Excuse me, sir,
but my father worked on cars...

33:07.321 --> 33:10.199
and my grandfather worked on cars.
I know what I'm doing.

33:10.282 --> 33:13.118
- A car is not a model airplane, young man.
- I know that.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.329
- It is a complex vehicle.
- I know that, too.

33:15.412 --> 33:18.499
I will not have my granddaughter
driving around in a contraption...

33:18.582 --> 33:21.001
- you put together in auto shop.
- Can I say something?

33:21.084 --> 33:25.547
I did not make this in auto shop.
I'm telling you, this car is safe.

33:25.631 --> 33:27.716
- So you are a certified mechanic?
- No.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.552
You had the assistance
of a certified mechanic?

33:30.636 --> 33:32.971
Then you drove it past
a certified mechanic?

33:33.013 --> 33:36.016
Dad, stop it.
This is a nice thing Dean did here.

33:36.099 --> 33:38.810
- Remember, nice things?
- I'm sorry, she can't accept it.

33:38.894 --> 33:42.147
Now, if you will excuse us,
we were about to order dinner.

33:42.189 --> 33:44.983
I understand you want Rory to be safe,
but so do I.

33:45.067 --> 33:47.903
I wouldn't give this car to her
if I didn't know for a fact...

33:47.986 --> 33:49.947
that it was 100% safe.

33:50.030 --> 33:53.742
I checked it, my father checked it,
and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it.

33:53.826 --> 33:55.035
It has been checked.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.162
I'm supposed to take your word for it?

33:57.246 --> 33:58.914
- No.
- Agreed.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.582
- Let's go.
- Go where?

34:00.666 --> 34:02.167
- To check it.
- I don't think so.

34:02.251 --> 34:04.628
I have been working on this car
for months.

34:04.670 --> 34:08.005
- I'm giving it to Rory.
- You're a very stubborn boy.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.342
You want to drive? Or should I?

34:10.551 --> 34:13.303
- I'll take my own car, thank you.
- Fine with me.

34:13.387 --> 34:16.514
Drive behind me. I don't want it
blowing up in front of the Jag.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.893
Try to keep your electrical system
working long enough to get there.

34:19.976 --> 34:22.813
They worked the kinks
out of this electrical system years ago.

34:22.855 --> 34:25.065
- I'll be right back.
- So will I.

34:29.945 --> 34:34.283
I feel like one of us should have stood
between them waving a flag or something.

34:35.242 --> 34:36.618
It looks fine to me.

34:36.702 --> 34:38.829
- Check it again.
- I already checked it again.

34:38.871 --> 34:41.748
I checked it earlier.
This was checking it again.

34:41.915 --> 34:43.792
Go ahead, Gypsy, check it again.

34:43.876 --> 34:45.377
- I've got all night.
- I don't.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.337
- Check the transmission.
- It's all good.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.630
- The carburetor.
- All good.

34:48.714 --> 34:50.924
- Manifold pressure.
- Best pressure I've ever seen.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.302
I insist you go over this entire car again.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.262
There's nothing wrong with this car.

34:55.344 --> 34:58.599
I am paying you for a service.
I would like that service performed.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.392
Okay, I look again.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.567
How many times
are you gonna make her do that?

35:08.650 --> 35:10.402
As many times as it takes.

35:12.654 --> 35:15.365
I know you think
I'm not good enough for Rory...

35:15.407 --> 35:19.453
- but do you have to take it out on my car?
- She's my only granddaughter.

35:19.536 --> 35:22.831
I have a responsibility to protect her.
She's young.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.125
- She's naive.
- She's smart.

35:25.209 --> 35:27.544
Yes, she's smart about certain things.

35:27.586 --> 35:29.880
Look, I'm not about to do battle
with you here.

35:29.922 --> 35:32.382
You can hate me, whatever. I don't care.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.968
I hardly hate you. I don't even know you.

35:35.052 --> 35:36.887
I'm right here. What do you want to know?

35:36.929 --> 35:39.765
Besides what college I want to go to
or what I want to do...

35:39.806 --> 35:41.767
because I still have no answers for you.

35:41.850 --> 35:43.769
Those are not ridiculous questions to ask.

35:43.810 --> 35:47.189
No, but you could have waited
until dessert to get to them.

35:47.272 --> 35:51.485
- Yes, well, perhaps, the timing of the...
- Interrogation?

35:51.568 --> 35:52.945
- Conversation.
- Conversation.

35:52.986 --> 35:56.073
Perhaps the timing was a little off.

36:04.623 --> 36:07.209
Your father. What does he do?

36:08.377 --> 36:10.796
- Stereo systems.
- Installing them?

36:11.296 --> 36:14.758
Selling them. He's got a shop
a couple of blocks from here.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.218
And your mother?

36:16.301 --> 36:19.429
She works part-time
transcribing medical records.

36:20.264 --> 36:21.974
Interesting.

36:27.813 --> 36:30.440
You like my granddaughter quite a bit.

36:30.649 --> 36:33.610
No, I love your granddaughter quite a bit.

36:33.652 --> 36:37.072
I was beginning to feel a little better
about this until you said that.

36:37.156 --> 36:40.534
I'm not trying to make you feel better.
I'm trying to be honest.

36:40.617 --> 36:42.077
Yes, you are.

36:42.911 --> 36:45.664
- That's an admirable quality.
- Thank you.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.333
Okay, I found something wrong.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.918
- You did?
- What?

36:50.002 --> 36:52.838
Windshield wipers came right off
in my hand. Very dangerous.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.256
Thank God I checked again.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.091
Gypsy, you broke those off yourself.

36:56.175 --> 36:57.551
- Yes, I did.
- Put them back.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.803
I can't look at this car anymore.

36:59.887 --> 37:02.181
- I miss my home.
- Put them back.

37:05.893 --> 37:08.395
- I suppose the car is safe.
- It is.

37:08.478 --> 37:12.024
- I'm still not sure it's an appropriate gift.
- I understand that.

37:17.196 --> 37:18.822
How tall are you?

37:19.656 --> 37:21.617
Why? You want to dance?

37:22.201 --> 37:23.660
No, thank you.

37:27.122 --> 37:29.458
I appreciate the offer, though.

37:31.168 --> 37:33.587
- How long are they going to be?
- I don't know.

37:33.670 --> 37:37.674
He probably made Dean take the entire
thing apart and put it back together again.

37:37.758 --> 37:38.800
Poor Dean.

37:38.884 --> 37:42.638
He has to spend one evening with him.
I share chromosomes with the guy.

37:42.721 --> 37:44.431
We had it thoroughly checked.

37:44.515 --> 37:47.226
We found a little problem
with the windshield wipers.

37:47.309 --> 37:51.063
Dean is there now, adjusting them.
But once that is taken care of...

37:51.104 --> 37:54.274
I don't see any reason why,
with proper insurance, of course...

37:54.358 --> 37:57.444
- why you can't have that car.
- Really? Thanks.

37:57.861 --> 38:00.697
Hon, why don't you run
and pick up the food for us?

38:00.739 --> 38:02.032
I've got this.

38:02.074 --> 38:04.576
Hurry, before the Mu Shu congeals.

38:06.787 --> 38:08.372
Why didn't you let me pay?

38:08.413 --> 38:12.334
I didn't think it would be appropriate
under the circumstances.

38:12.668 --> 38:14.545
What circumstances are those?

38:14.586 --> 38:17.881
The ones where I'm about to get
really mad at you.

38:17.923 --> 38:19.049
Excuse me?

38:19.925 --> 38:23.762
This is my house and my town,
where I live my life.

38:23.846 --> 38:25.430
Thank you for the geography lesson.

38:25.514 --> 38:27.599
In the 32 years we've known each other...

38:27.683 --> 38:31.103
have I once come to your work and
criticized the way you handle clients?

38:31.186 --> 38:32.938
I don't remember you coming at all.

38:32.980 --> 38:36.942
Have I passed judgment on your
breakfast habits or your clothing choices?

38:36.984 --> 38:38.277
I was offering opinions.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.697
I don't want your opinions,
especially not in front of my employees...

38:41.780 --> 38:43.282
and not in front of my friends.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.576
You can't take constructive criticism.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.703
Nothing that came out
of your mouth today...

38:47.786 --> 38:51.707
might in any universe, visited by Kirk
or Spock, be construed as constructive.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.833
I beg to differ.

38:52.916 --> 38:56.336
And this is the last time you come
into my house and overrule my word.

38:56.420 --> 38:59.798
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Dean and the car.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.426
- I was being...
- You have no right being anything.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.012
Rory's my kid, and I make the rules.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.471
If she comes home and says:

39:06.513 --> 39:09.349
'I'm gonna spend the weekend
with Patricia KrenwinkeI'...

39:09.433 --> 39:12.144
and I say, 'Okay, grab a sweater,'
you just have to deal.

39:12.186 --> 39:13.395
Who's Patricia Krenwinkel?

39:13.478 --> 39:16.732
If I tell her she can have the car
her boyfriend made for her...

39:16.815 --> 39:19.359
- then she can.
- I didn't think it looked safe.

39:19.443 --> 39:20.986
I have to think it looks safe.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.988
Why can't I make you hear
what I'm saying?

39:23.030 --> 39:24.698
I hear exactly what you're saying.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.700
You came here as the judgment police.

39:26.783 --> 39:29.453
You kept your uniform on,
and it comes off now.

39:29.495 --> 39:31.413
- Lower your voice.
- I am a grown woman.

39:31.497 --> 39:34.875
Treat me the way you treat people
who have invited you to their house...

39:34.958 --> 39:36.835
- or you will not be invited again.
- Invited?

39:36.919 --> 39:39.463
Don't you think
I know why you 'invited' me here?

39:39.505 --> 39:42.090
- Because...
- Because your mother asked you to.

39:42.174 --> 39:44.635
She called you up
and said I was driving her crazy.

39:44.676 --> 39:47.304
Would you please take me
off her hands for one day...

39:47.346 --> 39:49.598
so she could get some peace,
isn't that true?

39:49.681 --> 39:53.477
You have never once invited me
to your house, Lorelai. Never.

39:53.769 --> 39:56.939
I can hardly point to an event
that would prompt you to do so...

39:57.022 --> 39:59.316
except my recent employment situation.

39:59.358 --> 40:01.360
Okay, Dad, Mom did call me, but...

40:01.401 --> 40:03.862
I never thought about retirement.

40:03.904 --> 40:07.991
I never thought about what I would do
or what I would be once I wasn't working.

40:08.033 --> 40:11.787
I never once imagined that I would go
from being a productive member...

40:11.870 --> 40:13.288
of the human race...

40:13.372 --> 40:17.167
to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club
at 3:00 in the afternoon...

40:17.209 --> 40:19.336
drinking brandy and playing cards.

40:19.378 --> 40:23.048
I am an annoyance to my wife
and a burden to my daughter.

40:24.258 --> 40:28.053
Suddenly I realize
what it feels like to be obsolete.

40:29.179 --> 40:32.683
I hope that you never have to learn
what that feels like.

40:32.724 --> 40:34.726
Now, if you'll excuse me.

40:34.893 --> 40:38.856
I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check
on dinner. I'm not very hungry.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.870
- Nice picture.
- Gee, thanks.

40:52.911 --> 40:54.580
You're very popular right now.

40:54.663 --> 40:57.583
I bet if you burn a few books,
they'd probably make you mayor.

40:57.666 --> 40:59.710
- This is ridiculous.
- I don't know.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.378
You have a lot of supporters on this.

41:01.461 --> 41:04.756
Pat Buchanan, Jerry Falwell,
Kathie Lee Gifford.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.092
- Bye.
- Come on, it's a little funny.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.218
No.

41:08.302 --> 41:11.054
Being the poster girl for censorship
is not a little funny.

41:11.096 --> 41:14.183
The only videos not behind that
curtain are Bambi and Dumbo.

41:14.266 --> 41:15.517
They actually had a meeting...

41:15.601 --> 41:17.811
about whether Babe
should be behind the curtain...

41:17.895 --> 41:19.897
so as not to offend people
who keep kosher.

41:19.938 --> 41:21.440
It's a crazy world we live in.

41:21.481 --> 41:23.775
Where did they even find
that stupid picture?

41:23.817 --> 41:26.236
The picture's good.
It's the people who are stupid.

41:26.278 --> 41:29.406
- I'll never be able to leave my house.
- At least you won't starve.

41:29.490 --> 41:31.241
I can't look at it anymore.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.994
Relax. I don't think it'll be around
very long.

41:34.077 --> 41:36.872
- Why?
- Just a guess.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.502
- Enjoy the food.
- Come back here.

41:41.585 --> 41:43.587
- Why?
- I'll give you an egg roll.

41:46.965 --> 41:48.717
- Yes?
- What did you do?

41:48.800 --> 41:51.011
Nothing much.
Just wanted to make sure...

41:51.094 --> 41:53.430
whoever rented Dumbo or Bambi
gets a little surprise.

41:53.472 --> 41:55.474
What kind of a surprise?

41:55.516 --> 41:58.227
- What did you do?
- You owe me an egg roll.

42:17.329 --> 42:19.790
Richard, there you are,
sneaking in like that.

42:19.832 --> 42:22.000
- Hello, Emily.
- Nice to see you.

42:22.084 --> 42:23.293
You seem very happy.

42:23.377 --> 42:25.629
I had a very nice day.
Would you like a drink?

42:25.671 --> 42:29.132
I saw Kiki Lennox today.
She's redoing her entire house.

42:29.216 --> 42:32.302
I have to say, it's given me a few
ideas about this place.

42:32.344 --> 42:35.472
I won't scare you with them tonight,
but I'm very excited about it.

42:35.514 --> 42:36.640
I'm glad.

42:36.682 --> 42:39.518
Then I did a little shopping
and had my nails done.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.727
Very nice.

42:40.811 --> 42:43.814
Sugar and Spice,
a little crazier than I usually wear...

42:43.897 --> 42:46.567
but I don't know,
I was just in that kind of a mood.

42:46.650 --> 42:48.902
So how was your day with the girls?

42:48.986 --> 42:50.946
- Wonderful.
- Tell me about it.

42:51.029 --> 42:53.740
Well, I saw the town, I saw Lorelai's work.

42:53.866 --> 42:56.785
Did you eat? I can have Heloise
whip up something for you.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.328
No, thanks. We had Chinese food.

42:58.370 --> 43:00.664
- You love Chinese food.
- I do.

43:00.706 --> 43:03.250
Well, I'm thrilled you had
such a wonderful time.

43:03.333 --> 43:06.086
- It was good for you to get out like that.
- Yes, it was.

43:06.170 --> 43:09.047
In fact, I'm still a little energized
from the day...

43:09.131 --> 43:11.884
so I think I'm finally going to organize
all those stamps...

43:11.925 --> 43:13.719
that I've been talking about for ages.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.803
- Now?
- Why not?

43:14.887 --> 43:18.182
I think that would be wonderful. Have fun.

44:22.287 --> 44:23.288
English

44:24.305 --> 44:30.505
