00:18.333 --> 00:19.375
Good evening.

00:19.458 --> 00:21.833
-Good evening, thank you.
-Good evening.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.791
Look, there's lobster thermidor.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.583
We're going to dine like royalty, my love.

00:30.666 --> 00:32.500
Andrés, we need to talk.

00:37.041 --> 00:41.416
I don't like the sound of that sentence.
That's how all breakups begin.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.375
I know.

00:42.875 --> 00:46.875
I tried to find the best time to tell you,
but I guess there never is one.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.750
Don't say it's because of my illness.

00:51.916 --> 00:53.375
Hey, my love.

00:54.208 --> 00:55.166
My love,

00:55.750 --> 00:59.791
but that's the best reason
to stay together.

01:00.458 --> 01:04.000
Don't you see? We're not weighed down
by "the rest of our lives."

01:04.083 --> 01:06.333
That burdens any relationship.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.625
Our love is just for our enjoyment,

01:08.708 --> 01:12.416
because it's vibrant, light, ephemeral.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.583
It's pure hope. Do you know why?

01:17.041 --> 01:18.125
Because

01:18.208 --> 01:22.500
loving someone who's terminally ill
opens the door for the next love.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.791
It's like one of those wonderful trips
around old Europe.

01:26.875 --> 01:29.083
First, you go to Rome, then Vienna…

01:29.166 --> 01:32.541
You don't like Vienna? No problem.
Istanbul is around the corner.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.583
What if I make it easier?

01:36.333 --> 01:38.666
Let's say our relationship has changed.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.041
That we used to dream big.

01:41.625 --> 01:44.291
We wanted to visit Greenland,
see the northern lights.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.125
But after the vineyards in California

01:48.291 --> 01:49.333
came Madrid.

01:50.750 --> 01:51.750
And we're still here.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.750
You used to talk about
stealing the Spanish gold reserve.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.458
And here we are, city hopping. Doing what?

02:00.541 --> 02:02.583
Stealing some diamonds here,

02:03.083 --> 02:05.250
some Viking gold chalices there.

02:07.708 --> 02:10.666
It's not easy to retain
that initial level of fascination.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.625
Everyone gives their all during the chase.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.875
So, you want a divorce?

02:24.750 --> 02:25.583
I do.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.208
Can I take your order now?

02:28.291 --> 02:32.791
Not yet. You don't need to fill her glass.
It seems I'll be having this wine alone.

02:39.791 --> 02:42.541
I just want to know one thing.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.916
It's something small. Can I ask?

02:47.833 --> 02:49.166
Is there someone else?

02:52.541 --> 02:54.250
Don't make this harder.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.541
No. Come on, I can't believe it.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.791
That's the last thing
you're going to say to me?

03:02.333 --> 03:05.791
I've spent my whole life
searching for something real.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.625
Every second of my life,
in every decision I've made.

03:08.708 --> 03:13.500
And now I'm left with two of the most
overused sentences in movie history?

03:13.583 --> 03:16.125
"We need to talk,"
and "Don't make this harder"?

03:55.708 --> 03:56.666
Follow that car.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.666
Stop here.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.916
We're running out of water.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.791
This is the stormwater tank.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.791
The water's fluctuating.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.208
That's it! The last nuggets just came out!

07:09.291 --> 07:10.875
It's done!

07:12.500 --> 07:14.125
We did it!

07:30.583 --> 07:31.500
Colonel.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.875
Besides the engine,
I just heard a sharp suction noise.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.250
Did you say "suction"?
What are you talking about?

07:38.333 --> 07:42.500
It sounds like water going down a drain,
but on steroids.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.833
They're drawing water out.
Lots of gallons.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.083
No.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.250
Play it again.
Clear the signal as much as you can.

07:57.708 --> 08:00.000
It does sound like water being suctioned.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.291
I'd say they've emptied the vault.

08:03.375 --> 08:05.125
Did they get the gold out?

08:05.208 --> 08:06.958
I don't know. Maybe.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.833
You and the other engineer
told me it wasn't possible.

08:10.916 --> 08:13.166
It wasn't possible using the bank's pump.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.500
It isn't strong enough
to get that gold out.

08:15.583 --> 08:18.083
Unless it's been reduced
to micron-sized pieces.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.000
Even still,
I doubt they could move 90 tons.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.333
You don't know what they're capable of.

08:23.416 --> 08:27.666
They're pumping the gold out!
Tell me where it's going! Figure it out!

08:34.375 --> 08:35.250
Professor?

08:35.875 --> 08:39.166
Hey, in class you never told us
it'd be so fucking hard

08:39.250 --> 08:40.750
to get the gold out.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.375
Nor did I say it'd be easy.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.625
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
the criminal genius

08:44.708 --> 08:46.750
you fell in love with, like a 15-year-old.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.083
You're so silly.

08:49.750 --> 08:50.916
Over and out.

09:08.333 --> 09:11.833
Well, it seems things are coming
to an end, aren't they?

09:12.416 --> 09:13.625
Yes.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.458
When we get out…

09:17.875 --> 09:19.458
I'm going to buy a motorcycle,

09:19.541 --> 09:21.750
and imprint the shape of my ass
in the seat.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.541
I'll ride it around the world.

09:25.000 --> 09:25.875
Sounds good.

09:27.666 --> 09:30.041
What do you prefer, beach or pool?

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
Beach?

09:34.583 --> 09:36.041
One-piece or bikini?

09:40.625 --> 09:42.791
What's this, a Cosmopolitan questionnaire?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.333
It's just small talk.

09:47.791 --> 09:49.875
But if you want, when we get out,

09:51.250 --> 09:52.500
I'll take you out.

09:53.958 --> 09:55.375
And finish the questionnaire.

11:14.166 --> 11:17.291
Those embraces were not only
a celebration of triumph,

11:17.791 --> 11:21.291
or the heartfelt tribute
to those who fell along the way.

11:21.375 --> 11:25.291
It was the uproar
of a handful of insignificant people

11:25.375 --> 11:30.291
who had managed to move
90 tons of gold through a pipe,

11:30.791 --> 11:34.416
sending out
a message of hope to the world.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.333
"The impossible is possible."

11:39.875 --> 11:41.833
But the attack wasn't over.

11:42.583 --> 11:46.375
And we were going to need
massive amounts of that hope

11:46.458 --> 11:48.333
in the next few hours of the heist.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.208
Ahead of us we'd simply have to face

11:52.291 --> 11:55.291
the harshest reality check ever.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.916
I heard we got the gold out.

12:08.916 --> 12:10.166
I kissed Manila.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.666
Actually, that's not important.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.875
What matters is I'm really confused.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.541
I think I have more in common with her
than with you.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.416
Do you know
what I used to do in Indonesia?

12:36.125 --> 12:39.875
I'd tell you I was going to buy wood,
but I'd go party for two days.

12:41.083 --> 12:44.541
I did it behind your back because I felt
everything I wanted was wrong.

12:46.875 --> 12:47.833
I don't know.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.750
Being with Manila somehow

12:50.833 --> 12:53.500
made me realize that I'm not wrong.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.166
Aren't you going to say anything?

13:05.041 --> 13:06.916
I'd rather talk later, Denver.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.375
I have an awful headache, and…

13:11.208 --> 13:12.708
I'd rather get some rest.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.250
Alone.

13:14.875 --> 13:15.750
Sure.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.916
They must be moving it
through the stream that floods the vault.

13:26.416 --> 13:29.208
All the water is gathered
in two natural streams,

13:29.291 --> 13:32.083
and then drains
into another stream in the south.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.791
Motherfuckers.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.416
They wouldn't move it
through the drain or sewer.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.041
They're pumping the gold far away,
through the stream.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.458
They must have brought in
a more powerful pump.

13:42.208 --> 13:46.625
To cover those 16 miles of channels
carrying 90 tons of gold,

13:46.708 --> 13:49.291
they'd need at least an oil-pipeline pump.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.666
Find Suárez. We need to comb that stream.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.458
And bring me the pipe maps.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.208
I want to know
everywhere those channels go,

13:56.291 --> 13:57.833
where they end, everything.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.916
We're launching an offensive.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.708
What now?

14:02.208 --> 14:06.541
Well, now we'll assign lookout shifts,
freshen up. How does that sound?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.833
And wait for the Professor to act.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.625
Where are they sending the gold?

14:11.708 --> 14:15.625
These channels lead to many factories,
treatment plants,

14:15.708 --> 14:18.416
hydraulic facilities, stormwater tanks…

14:18.500 --> 14:20.125
We need to check every single one.

14:20.208 --> 14:24.083
I want soldiers combing
every cubic inch of water in those pipes.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.666
There are over 5,000 soldiers
surrounding the bank,

14:26.750 --> 14:29.208
and running Operation Cage
to find the Professor.

14:29.291 --> 14:32.750
-How many police officers can we count on?
-About 480 units.

14:32.833 --> 14:36.000
And your men, Suárez.
Everyone, off to the stream!

14:36.083 --> 14:37.000
Come on!

14:37.500 --> 14:39.083
Constant communication.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.875
Let's go!

15:00.750 --> 15:04.875
There's not much movement outside.
Just some vehicles leaving the perimeter.

15:04.958 --> 15:06.833
I think things are calming down.

15:07.791 --> 15:11.000
The police are still looking for me
in Madrid. Get some rest.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.166
Arteche, do you copy?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.250
Arteche, what's going on?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.000
I need a few minutes.

15:30.583 --> 15:31.583
Okay, roger that.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.333
Stockholm.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.458
Stockholm.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.750
Stockholm. It's Tokyo.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.083
I'm here.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.708
What's going on? Mónica!

16:44.791 --> 16:46.583
Mónica!

16:56.416 --> 16:59.333
What's wrong?

17:00.041 --> 17:01.125
What's wrong?

17:04.041 --> 17:05.458
I'm going crazy.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.500
I saw Arturo. Arturo talks to me.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.541
And Tokyo is in the dumbwaiter.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.333
It's okay.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.416
I think I have psychosis.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.458
I see things and shoot at them.
I'm dangerous. I need to get out.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.916
-I need medical help.
-You can't leave.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.333
Denver, I surrender. I want to get out.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.000
I almost killed you.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.833
-I'm dangerous.
-Listen.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.583
I have an idea, okay?

17:31.333 --> 17:33.875
I'm going to lock you in the vault.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.833
-No.
-You can't hurt anyone in there.

17:35.916 --> 17:38.208
-I have to get out.
-I'll look after you.

17:39.083 --> 17:43.000
I'll look after you.
If you don't get better, I'll get you out.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.125
Okay?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.250
Okay.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.458
Suárez, all channels must be checked.

18:26.541 --> 18:30.875
Your unit will go to the treatment plant.
The rest will continue southbound.

I don't know why I told you about Manila.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.583
No, Denver.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.583
What you said was painful, but…

19:09.208 --> 19:10.833
somehow I'm glad.

19:11.583 --> 19:14.375
It's the most honest thing
you've said to me

19:14.458 --> 19:15.666
in a long time.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.125
And anyway, don't worry about Manila.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.833
I already knew.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.541
You already knew?

19:23.458 --> 19:24.583
She told me.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.833
And I knew about Indonesia as well.
Well, I guessed.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.833
And why did you let me lie to you?

19:36.416 --> 19:40.708
I guess it was easier to accept
that you needed an escape than…

19:42.125 --> 19:45.833
ask you whether
our life together bored you,

19:45.916 --> 19:48.041
in case you said "yes," Denver,

19:48.125 --> 19:50.833
because I loved our life together.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.583
A lot.

19:53.791 --> 19:54.875
Me too.

19:55.625 --> 19:57.083
Then why did you lie to me?

19:57.166 --> 19:58.291
I don't know.

19:59.458 --> 20:00.500
I don't…

20:01.875 --> 20:04.750
I guess I was afraid my dad was right.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.083
He always used to say
I wasn't good enough for you.

20:11.583 --> 20:13.666
That I didn't measure up, you know?

20:14.458 --> 20:15.333
He was right.

20:16.666 --> 20:20.708
Who'd want a guy who needs to go to a club
60 miles away from home

20:20.791 --> 20:23.666
to party, get high as a kite,

20:23.750 --> 20:26.416
raise hell,
and fight with the first guy I see?

20:28.500 --> 20:30.916
I was afraid to show you that side of me.

20:32.625 --> 20:33.791
That beast.

20:36.416 --> 20:37.916
I was afraid you'd leave.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.708
-Are they here?
-Yes.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.750
The ectoplasms?

20:52.208 --> 20:53.500
It's not funny.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.750
-I wasn't joking.
-No.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.041
-You know what bugs me?
-What?

20:58.125 --> 21:00.333
Fucking Arturo. He's so annoying.

21:00.416 --> 21:03.583
He's so annoying he even managed
to butt into your psychosis.

21:03.666 --> 21:05.791
I know they're real because, well,

21:05.875 --> 21:08.875
post-traumatic stress,
tension during the heist…

21:08.958 --> 21:10.791
Psychosis. Okay.

21:12.041 --> 21:16.000
But since you're having visions…
Why don't you try and see nice things?

21:16.083 --> 21:19.208
-What do you want me to see?
-Something that makes you smile.

21:19.291 --> 21:23.166
Anything that won't make you empty clips.
You almost killed me.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.416
Do you know what I'd like to see?

21:28.500 --> 21:29.541
What?

21:30.500 --> 21:31.333
You.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.791
In one of those clubs,
dancing your head off.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.958
-I'm not sure you'd like it.
-Yes.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.333
What about you?

21:39.416 --> 21:40.791
-What about me?
-Dancing.

21:40.875 --> 21:41.750
-Here?
-Yes.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.916
-No.
-Yes, dance for me.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.500
-No, I can't.
-Why not?

21:45.583 --> 21:48.416
Look at me,
I'm all dirty and wearing red overalls.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.958
I can fix that.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.375
You're going to love it.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.291
Colonel, Suárez speaking.

22:04.375 --> 22:06.208
Approaching the treatment plant.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.750
Come on. Stay alert, and move steadily.

22:20.583 --> 22:22.541
Colonel, we're going underground.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.833
Police!

22:36.916 --> 22:39.000
Police! Everyone get on the ground!

22:47.416 --> 22:48.875
All clear here, Colonel.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.375
Next location.

22:54.625 --> 22:57.833
Hydraulic dam. I repeat, hydraulic dam.

23:01.875 --> 23:02.750
Well?

23:14.791 --> 23:15.625
My God.

24:39.500 --> 24:42.250
I'm going to the main door
to defuse the last explosives.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.041
Roger that. Keep me informed.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.500
Unit 2 approaching the hydraulic dam.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.125
Let's go.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.083
Unit 2 entering the dam, sir.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.125
Watch out for the bifurcations.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.916
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

25:21.583 --> 25:22.666
Now.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.708
Stop, police! Get on the ground!

25:27.083 --> 25:28.125
Hands up!

25:28.208 --> 25:30.250
There are two suspects at close range.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.958
-What's going on?
-Get back!

25:32.041 --> 25:33.500
Don't move! On the ground!

25:35.791 --> 25:36.791
It's not them, sir.

25:36.875 --> 25:37.833
Shit!

25:44.625 --> 25:45.875
Next location.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.833
SANTA JUSTA STORMWATER TANK

26:11.583 --> 26:15.166
-Cheers! To the 90 tons.
-To the 90 tons, sweetie.

26:19.958 --> 26:20.833
Guys.

26:22.750 --> 26:23.916
I want a city name.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.291
This late in the game?

26:28.375 --> 26:29.375
Well…

26:30.500 --> 26:32.625
If it ends badly and we get arrested,

26:33.500 --> 26:37.458
what will they say on TV?
"They've arrested Palermo, Rio,

26:37.541 --> 26:39.708
Manila, Bogotá…

26:39.791 --> 26:42.500
and Matías Caño."
I sound like a fucking intern.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.875
Have you thought of a name?

26:47.541 --> 26:48.541
Pamplona.

26:52.666 --> 26:53.625
You nailed it.

26:53.708 --> 26:56.500
It's the perfect name
for a crook like you.

26:58.416 --> 27:02.000
-What's wrong with "Pamplona"?
-Find something stronger, more memorable.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.250
Something that can be said in one go.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.208
Rio.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.458
Sweetie, "Manila."
Manila is exotic, sexy, burlesque…

27:10.541 --> 27:12.000
-"Sydney."
-"Palermo."

27:12.083 --> 27:13.375
Palermo is taken.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.250
-"Marrakesh."
-"Charbonier."

27:15.333 --> 27:17.291
But have you ever been to Pamplona?

27:18.333 --> 27:21.916
The wildest festival in the world
is held there, Sanfermines.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.833
Even the Japanese come for the bull-run,

27:24.916 --> 27:28.541
and Hemingway wrote a novel
that's studied at colleges in the States.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.583
Do you know the title?

27:30.666 --> 27:32.041
-No.
-The Sun Also Rises.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.833
It's called The Sun Also Rises!

27:33.916 --> 27:37.166
You want to party until dawn?
Then go to the Sanfermines.

27:37.958 --> 27:40.791
-Fine, "Pamplona" it is!
-To Pamplona!

27:40.875 --> 27:42.750
-To Pamplona, what the hell.
-Come on.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.916
-Pamplona it is.
-That's right.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.833
-No problem.
-To Pamplona.

28:49.166 --> 28:52.416
Don't worry,
Tatiana just went up to her room.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.791
Good evening.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.583
I'll have a negroni, please.

28:59.458 --> 29:01.125
Do you know what elegance is?

29:03.416 --> 29:04.583
Look at that.

29:05.166 --> 29:08.333
When you see a guy like that,
dapper, immaculate,

29:08.416 --> 29:10.416
you can say, "I'd fuck his wife"

29:11.000 --> 29:12.458
without ever seeing her.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.666
Because you're absolutely convinced

29:14.750 --> 29:16.958
that woman is amazing.

29:18.333 --> 29:21.041
And that's why you slept with my wife.

29:24.250 --> 29:27.750
Although you should be the one
to seduce the women.

29:27.833 --> 29:32.333
I'm not sure it should be your father
who seduces women on your behalf.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.250
I couldn't help it.

29:42.375 --> 29:46.708
I wish it had been me who told you
about the whole situation, but…

29:48.125 --> 29:51.666
I couldn't help it, Dad. I'm sorry.
I just couldn't.

29:59.791 --> 30:00.708
Since when?

30:02.125 --> 30:03.583
It's been two weeks.

30:05.416 --> 30:06.375
Three.

30:07.708 --> 30:08.791
Three weeks.

30:08.875 --> 30:12.458
Then what we had
wasn't robust and strong enough

30:12.541 --> 30:16.833
to resist the sweeping winds
of a fleeting lover.

30:18.041 --> 30:18.916
A fleeting lover?

30:19.500 --> 30:20.541
Really, Dad?

30:21.041 --> 30:22.458
A fleeting lover?

30:24.375 --> 30:27.375
Maybe Tatiana's head over heels
in love with me.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.666
You didn't consider that option, did you?

30:29.750 --> 30:31.833
I'm really in love with her, Dad.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.083
Really.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.291
As strange as it may seem,
this is a true love story.

30:38.875 --> 30:40.083
It was fate.

30:47.291 --> 30:48.125
Look at that.

30:48.750 --> 30:53.166
This is the first time I feel like
you're going to measure up.

30:53.750 --> 30:57.916
I would've gone after my dad's wife too
if I'd fallen in love with her.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.375
I wouldn't have given it a second thought.

31:01.166 --> 31:04.708
I would've broken
the sacred bonds of family,

31:05.375 --> 31:06.750
and respect,

31:07.250 --> 31:09.000
to satisfy my love.

31:14.708 --> 31:16.125
And in that respect, I'm…

31:17.583 --> 31:18.708
very proud of you.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.708
Look who's coming.

31:27.625 --> 31:29.416
I admit, you're better off with him.

31:29.500 --> 31:34.375
An attractive, intelligent,

31:34.458 --> 31:37.208
ambitious and unscrupulous young man,
like his father.

31:37.291 --> 31:38.750
And apparently he's healthy.

31:38.833 --> 31:42.208
The only downside
is that short of a year or two,

31:42.291 --> 31:46.958
you're not going to get a widower pension
and a huge inheritance.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.416
We had so much fun.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.125
I wish you the best.

32:24.583 --> 32:25.791
Go in peace.

34:18.708 --> 34:21.708
That was the only time
Berlin ever went to prison.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.000
Arrested for vandalism.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.708
And all for a broken heart.

34:29.750 --> 34:31.083
He let them catch him.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.875
On top of that,
he was given a few more months

34:34.958 --> 34:37.708
for some fingerprints found
at the scene of a robbery.

34:39.416 --> 34:41.583
But he couldn't care less about prison

34:42.583 --> 34:44.708
when his heart had just been broken.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.166
Santa Justa stormwater tank.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.333
I repeat, that's where they are,
Santa Justa stormwater tank.

34:55.416 --> 34:58.375
Bronze Unit to Tamayo.
We're approaching the exit.

35:13.458 --> 35:14.791
Colonel, Suárez speaking.

35:14.875 --> 35:17.083
Approaching the stormwater tank.

35:29.958 --> 35:33.208
Let's go.
It has to be here! We got it this time!

35:45.333 --> 35:46.833
Police!

35:46.916 --> 35:48.666
They're coming!

35:54.000 --> 35:55.541
Go, grab your weapons!

35:57.291 --> 35:58.500
They're coming!

36:28.375 --> 36:30.375
Grab the weapons, for fuck's sake.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.750
Professor, take shelter. Grab the gun.

36:36.833 --> 36:38.000
Grab the gun.

36:38.083 --> 36:39.041
Grab the gun!

36:40.666 --> 36:42.791
Professor! What's wrong? Wake up!

36:42.875 --> 36:45.041
-They're coming! Grab the gun!
-No.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.041
No, drop the gun.

36:47.541 --> 36:48.916
Drop the weapons!

36:49.000 --> 36:52.083
-It's just four cars. We can take them.
-No.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.375
Now it's four cars.

36:54.791 --> 36:57.875
Then it'll be ten, then 50, then the army.
Don't you get it?

36:57.958 --> 37:00.958
They found out we're here.
We can't do anything.

37:01.041 --> 37:03.458
They know we're here.
There's nothing we can do.

37:04.125 --> 37:06.625
Benjamín, nothing!
Do you hear me? Drop them.

37:08.541 --> 37:11.041
Didn't you hear me? Drop your weapons!

37:11.125 --> 37:12.500
Let's defend ourselves!

37:13.375 --> 37:14.500
No.

37:15.125 --> 37:17.416
-Move over.
-Please, Marseille, don't.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.208
I didn't surrender
when they arrested Lisbon.

37:20.291 --> 37:23.458
I didn't do it
when the army entered the bank,

37:23.541 --> 37:25.833
or when fucking Gandía killed Nairobi!

37:25.916 --> 37:27.541
-You're going to do it now.
-No.

37:27.625 --> 37:28.625
It's an order!

37:28.708 --> 37:30.541
Sergio, they killed Tokyo!

37:33.750 --> 37:36.583
Marseille, listen to me.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.958
-I'm not going to cause a massacre.
-No.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.625
I won't let people die
for something that's already lost.

37:43.708 --> 37:44.541
No!

37:45.958 --> 37:47.250
It's already lost.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.125
It's already lost.

38:41.875 --> 38:43.500
Stop! Get on the ground!

38:49.500 --> 38:50.666
On the ground!

38:52.583 --> 38:53.583
Don't move!

38:58.000 --> 38:58.916
Don't move!

39:44.041 --> 39:45.791
I just got out of prison.

39:48.333 --> 39:51.125
You came to pick me up, brought me here,

39:51.708 --> 39:55.833
and you spent 98 miles
in complete silence.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.875
There's nothing you want to know?

40:01.541 --> 40:03.833
Maybe I was raped in the showers.

40:05.125 --> 40:08.083
Or maybe I got Mom's name tattooed
on my bicep.

40:09.166 --> 40:10.541
You let them catch you.

40:11.125 --> 40:13.333
You've pulled off 27 heists in Europe,

40:13.916 --> 40:18.541
but that day you destroyed a cocktail bar
in Madrid and let them catch you.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.708
The negroni was terrible.
I couldn't allow such a disgrace.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.583
Losing my son broke my heart.

40:28.708 --> 40:31.541
I can understand my wife betraying me.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.708
Or my business partner, even my son.

40:37.708 --> 40:38.958
But I lost him,

40:40.250 --> 40:42.625
right when I decided

40:44.125 --> 40:46.500
to admit he existed for the first time.

40:49.208 --> 40:52.750
That's something
failure throws in your face

40:52.833 --> 40:55.916
when something in your life isn't right.

40:56.416 --> 40:59.625
But it's failure…

41:04.083 --> 41:05.500
…that defines a man.

41:06.958 --> 41:09.541
Some behave pusillanimously.

41:10.375 --> 41:11.500
Some accept it.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.125
Others rebel against it,

41:15.833 --> 41:17.291
but without dignity.

41:18.041 --> 41:18.875
And others

41:20.583 --> 41:22.666
can't help but destroy everything

41:23.500 --> 41:25.583
in order to have another life.

41:30.083 --> 41:31.083
I swear…

41:33.666 --> 41:34.833
I'm determined

41:34.916 --> 41:37.583
to squeeze every second
out of the life I have left.

41:37.666 --> 41:38.875
Every last drop.

41:42.791 --> 41:46.291
That's why, now, I want to help you

41:47.708 --> 41:49.708
pull off the heist of a lifetime.

41:54.541 --> 42:00.041
Before I die, you and I are going to rob
the Royal Mint of Spain.

42:12.416 --> 42:14.041
God!

42:14.125 --> 42:15.958
God!

42:16.625 --> 42:18.625
God!

42:21.500 --> 42:23.083
God!

42:24.333 --> 42:25.666
Little brother!

42:26.375 --> 42:28.750
God!

42:47.500 --> 42:48.750
How long will we get?

42:50.458 --> 42:51.666
A thousand years.

43:06.708 --> 43:09.458
-How long have we been here?
-Fifteen or twenty minutes.

43:11.375 --> 43:14.041
They should have taken us
into police custody.

43:15.083 --> 43:16.125
Exactly.

43:17.791 --> 43:19.666
They'll be waiting for forensics.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.208
We can only hear police sirens.

43:25.125 --> 43:27.750
We can hear the walkie-talkies,
but not the cars.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.041
Why can't we hear more cars?

43:38.833 --> 43:41.083
Why won't the police be waiting for us?

43:41.166 --> 43:45.166
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
but we do have the answer.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.208
Yes, we'll get the gold out

43:48.291 --> 43:50.958
through the only place we can, but…

43:52.375 --> 43:54.625
not in the direction
the police will expect.

43:55.416 --> 43:57.083
It's a wastewater tank.

43:57.166 --> 43:59.791
Suárez, go get them! They're in there!

43:59.875 --> 44:01.333
-Police!
-We got them!

44:05.000 --> 44:07.416
Colonel, the stormwater tank is empty.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.625
Fuck, no way.

44:08.708 --> 44:12.000
Logically, we should take advantage
of the gentle river slope

44:12.083 --> 44:16.208
and get the gold out that way,
but that would be too easy.

44:16.291 --> 44:19.750
It's the last place
the channels flow into. I don't get it!

44:20.416 --> 44:21.250
How can it be?

44:21.333 --> 44:25.583
Then, we'll take advantage
of the 5,000 kilowatts of our pump

44:25.666 --> 44:28.291
to push the gold

44:28.375 --> 44:30.541
almost 11 miles upstream.

44:30.625 --> 44:34.750
We'll get the gold up the river,
like fucking salmons,

44:34.833 --> 44:36.583
to the stormwater tank.

44:36.666 --> 44:39.000
That, my dear,
is something no one expects.

44:39.083 --> 44:42.791
We've combed 16 miles of pipes
with metal detectors and found nothing.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.875
Not the police, not the CNI,

44:44.958 --> 44:47.541
not even
the Spanish National Research Council.

44:47.625 --> 44:48.541
No one.

44:48.625 --> 44:51.125
It's impossible for 90 tons of gold
to leave no trace.

44:51.208 --> 44:53.541
They didn't get it out that way, fuck!

44:53.625 --> 44:57.125
Then where is it?
They couldn't get it out any other way!

44:57.208 --> 44:59.833
Someone tell me
where that fuck that gold is!

45:03.583 --> 45:05.083
LOS MIGUELES STORMWATER TANK

45:08.125 --> 45:09.291
What are you doing?

45:15.750 --> 45:18.500
My baby!

45:18.583 --> 45:19.833
It's my baby!

45:20.333 --> 45:21.625
Fuck!

45:23.083 --> 45:24.000
Kick it!

45:45.833 --> 45:46.833
Victoria.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.583
Our gold's been stolen.

46:18.583 --> 46:20.958
-We did it!
-We did it!

47:52.833 --> 47:56.625
