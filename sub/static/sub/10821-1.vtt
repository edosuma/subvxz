01:35.560 --> 01:38.340
Anthony, what are you doing down there?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.340
Just praying.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.568
Well, pray properly.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.540
Have you thought about your sins?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.380
I think I thought about them enough.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.980
Well, go get in the confessional, then.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.780
Be quick, 'cause we have to go.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.123
Skip some sins if you have to.
He'll get the point.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.980
Bless me, for I have sinned.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.764
"Father."

03:13.280 --> 03:14.884
"Bless me, Father."

03:16.520 --> 03:19.420
...for I have sinned.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.420
I think it's been eight weeks
since my last confession.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.488
These are my sins.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.740
Yes?

03:30.840 --> 03:32.020
What are your sins?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.860
I can't think of any.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.780
Are you trying to tell me that
you haven't even dishonored your mom...

03:36.880 --> 03:39.087
or your dad in the last two months?

03:40.400 --> 03:43.051
I don't see my dad enough to dishonor him.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.060
- Well, must've lied to them?
- No.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.180
- Must've lied to somebody?
- No.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.340
- You're lying to me now.
- No, I'm not.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.540
A boy can't go that long
without a falsehood.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.820
Maybe once.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.580
This girl in school...

03:58.680 --> 04:02.340
she asked me if I liked her cookies...

04:02.440 --> 04:04.100
and I said yes.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.281
Was that wrong?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.331
How about impure thoughts?
You must have had some of those.

04:12.840 --> 04:13.966
What's an impure thought?

04:14.480 --> 04:17.608
Maybe you wished bad things for someone?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.011
Why would I do that?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.604
Maybe thoughts about sex?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.364
What do those thoughts look like?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.420
Listen.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.362
No one is waiting.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.529
You think about it for a moment.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.722
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Walt.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.900
Running a little late, aren't we?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.180
Yeah, the truck's been stalling on me.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.980
Those shit after-market parts.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.287
Are you sure you're up
to taking Anthony this weekend?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.531
When are you back?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.041
About 4:00 tomorrow.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.780
Where you going?

05:09.880 --> 05:12.884
The church is having
a marriage encounter weekend.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.524
No, no. That's good.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.540
So...

05:21.640 --> 05:24.300
you're back with the church again?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.340
Kyle and I thought
it would be good for Anthony...

05:26.440 --> 05:27.660
so we're getting him caught up.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.060
Next week he is doing
First Communion and Confirmation.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.340
Yeah, you mentioned that.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.523
That's a lot of church
for a boy in one week.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.660
Well, Anthony seems to like it.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.242
And make sure he gets here
for mass tomorrow.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.691
Jesus. Poor kid.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.980
And he has to stay clean
before the sacraments next week...

05:48.080 --> 05:49.860
so please keep him out of trouble, okay?

05:49.960 --> 05:53.521
Well, I don't know what kind
of trouble he can get in in a day.

06:03.120 --> 06:05.980
Getting hot already.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.180
How's the house?

06:07.280 --> 06:08.820
Anything needs work...

06:08.920 --> 06:11.340
I can always come by and fix it.

06:11.440 --> 06:14.250
Kyle doesn't really
do that stuff, does he?

06:15.600 --> 06:18.763
No, Kyle doesn't have to.
He pays people to do it.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.940
Remember any sins yet, son?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.780
I'm not your son.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.740
You're God's son.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.900
You're not God.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.162
I am God's representation here on Earth.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.722
I thought Jesus was God's son.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.380
Say five Our Fathers and three Hail Marys.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.660
Okay.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.081
"Bless you, Father."

06:45.800 --> 06:48.020
Okay.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.460
I absolve you of your sins...

06:49.560 --> 06:52.380
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.860
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.644
Thanks be to the God.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.242
Promise me no drinking this weekend.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.460
I don't drink anymore.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.540
And even when I do, it's not that much.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.120
I'm serious.
We've been through this before.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.780
One more time, and that's it,
you don't see him.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.220
So promise me.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.020
I don't have to promise.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.849
I just won't do it.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.780
Our Father...

07:47.880 --> 07:49.644
who art in Heaven...

08:00.880 --> 08:01.980
Hey.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.940
What took you so long?

08:04.040 --> 08:05.860
Jesus, son...

08:05.960 --> 08:08.340
how many commandments did you break?

08:08.440 --> 08:09.680
Not that many.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.485
Did you say all your penance?

08:13.560 --> 08:15.300
The prayers that the priest has you say.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.686
Did you do all them?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.300
Yeah, Mom, I said them.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.020
Good. Okay. I love you.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.180
Love you.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.020
Have fun.
I'll see you tomorrow, all right?

08:27.120 --> 08:28.820
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.684
Bye.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.289
So, you learn anything
in school this week?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.124
Yeah, we had to.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.561
Like what?

08:56.680 --> 08:59.620
Well, my teacher said...

08:59.720 --> 09:03.180
that the scientists think
there might be more universes.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.260
More universes?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.044
Yeah.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.940
Did you hear what you just said?

09:11.040 --> 09:13.940
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.420
"Universe" means universal.
That's everything.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.140
You know, "uni" means one...

09:19.240 --> 09:22.767
"verse" means... all.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.500
There can only be one universe.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.020
Maybe I should have a talk
with this teacher of yours...

09:29.120 --> 09:32.980
'cause he's teaching you
a lot of nonsense.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.860
It's a woman.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.362
Well, women are just as full
of it as men, you know.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.244
You didn't know that?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.009
Kinda.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.926
I got a lead on a job.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.005
You stay in the truck.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.930
I'll be right out.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.700
Won't say a damn thing about it, right?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.340
Hey. Watch where you're going.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.380
Where are you going, anyway?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.960
What's happening out here?

11:24.400 --> 11:26.641
Jesus Christ.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.927
Never play in this truck.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.530
Do you hear me?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.860
Hey there. What are you having?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.740
I don't know.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.780
Don't know or don't care,
like your old man?

12:02.880 --> 12:05.042
Hey, I told you a while ago.
I'll be right out.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.300
I need to see some I.D., partner.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.290
I don't have some I.D. I'm not 21.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.900
All right, guys.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.460
Let me know if anything comes up.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.340
Anything.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.204
Come on.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.660
Can we go to the Hamburger Hut?

12:36.760 --> 12:40.660
Why waste money on that when I have food?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.161
I'll make you a sandwich.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.420
Pa?

12:59.520 --> 13:00.820
What's a "hussy"?

13:00.920 --> 13:02.860
Where did you hear
anything like that, Mark?

13:02.960 --> 13:06.140
At school.
Some of the girls were tearing around.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.060
Aren't you going to eat?

13:08.160 --> 13:09.820
Nah. I'm not hungry.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.809
...about being a hussy. What does it mean?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.620
Well, Mark...

13:14.720 --> 13:16.100
it means a worthless woman.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.620
- You mean shiftless and no account?
- That's right.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.700
So what are we going to do?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.007
What do you mean "do"?

13:25.960 --> 13:27.660
This weekend?

13:27.760 --> 13:30.411
They were probably repeating
something they heard, son.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.620
I don't know.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.245
Maybe go to Otto's.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.605
Yeah?

13:44.840 --> 13:47.300
Yes, I can.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.380
Yeah, I got all those tools.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.323
I got joinery, staircase...

13:53.120 --> 13:56.169
Yeah, I use the antique carving.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.020
Behind the Pastime. Monday morning, 9:00.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.770
Great. Thanks.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.340
Here's something to do.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.090
I got a job Monday.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.860
Go to the truck, unlock the big box...

14:12.960 --> 14:15.700
and bring me my wood tool box.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.740
The one with the old chisels and knives?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.100
You can help me sharpen them.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.725
Okay.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.043
- It's gone.
- What do you mean it's gone?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.740
The lock was on?

14:55.840 --> 14:58.002
Yeah, but it was unlocked.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.244
You left the truck alone at the tavern.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.460
Just for a few minutes.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.484
Yeah, I told you to stay in the truck.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.246
You forgot to lock it.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.924
Sometimes, when you're drunk,
you forget things.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.820
Can't you get new ones?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.580
Those are specialty tools.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.300
They're hard to find.
They cost a lot of money.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.940
If Otto doesn't have some to borrow...

15:32.040 --> 15:34.771
I've got to find the son of a bitch
who stole mine or I'm screwed.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.961
So we are going to Otto's.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.340
- Anthony.
- Hey, Otto.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.180
- How you doing? Walt.
- Hey.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.780
We don't see you guys enough.
How you doing?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.860
Good. Excellent.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.900
- Come on in.
- No, I'm sorry.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.860
Otto, we can't stay.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.660
I just wanted to see
if you've still got your Swiss files.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.060
I got a job Monday.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.300
- Mine went missing.
- Not that nice, old set?

16:11.400 --> 16:12.940
Yeah, they knew what they were after.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.620
Went right for them, left everything else.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.340
All right, well, let's see
what we got in the back.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.646
There we go.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.722
Wait.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.900
I sold mine a while back.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.900
Well, how long? Maybe I can find them.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.660
Not long. Maybe ten years.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.445
I got to find mine, then.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.620
You know, who you should talk to...

16:42.720 --> 16:47.060
is Guy Bishop over at Swift Creek Tavern.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.900
- Is he the owner?
- No, but he's always there.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.820
He's a good guy. Retired.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.526
He knows just about everybody.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.740
He might know
who would steal tools like yours.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.180
Was he a cop?

17:01.280 --> 17:02.780
No, a thief.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.619
- But he's a good guy now?
- Better than most.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.540
Better than most thieves
or better than most guys?

17:09.640 --> 17:11.500
Thieves.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.540
But he's a good guy now.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.130
He found Jesus.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.965
Well, if he found Jesus,
maybe he can find my tools.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.940
All right. See you, Otto.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.371
Good hunting.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.980
Dad?

17:31.080 --> 17:33.100
Why don't you have a job?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.620
What do you mean?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.500
I have a job.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.331
I'm a finish carpentry specialist.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.129
Well, I mean, like, all the time.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.980
I'm what's called a freelancer.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.731
I pick what jobs I want to do.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.247
Mom says you don't really work.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.240
Well, your mom is...

17:58.680 --> 18:00.409
mistaken.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.500
Wait here.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.931
I won't be long.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.420
Is there someone called Guy Bishop here?

18:15.520 --> 18:17.460
Yeah, good one.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.166
He's the old guy.
Right over there, as usual.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.487
Let me think.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.620
Do you know Vaughn Bennett?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.380
Barely.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.780
I worked a job with him once.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.580
You think he stole them?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.220
No.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.060
He knows all the guys around here...

19:08.160 --> 19:10.083
and they listen to him.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.685
If Vaughn puts out the word...

19:16.400 --> 19:18.164
you'll get your tools back.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.370
What are you doing?

20:14.560 --> 20:17.291
Why were you out of the pickup?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.562
I was just...

20:20.480 --> 20:22.528
standing out there.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.641
Hi.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.260
Hi.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.250
Hey. Is your dad here?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.620
Hey.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.580
How's it going?

20:57.680 --> 21:00.420
- This your boy?
- Yeah, this is Anthony.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.860
Can we talk?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.820
Sure. Come on inside.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.766
Allen, take Anthony out back and play.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.003
Hi, Linda. This is Anthony.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.980
Hi.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.900
That's my girlfriend.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.968
I want to show you something.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.300
So, they only took the specialty tools?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.323
They knew what they wanted.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.380
There's only a handful
of guys in this town...

21:38.480 --> 21:41.020
who know how to use those
or know their value.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.488
- Yeah, that makes sense.
- Hell, yes, it makes sense.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.220
Any idea where this happened?

21:48.320 --> 21:51.420
Well, it could have been
The Signal, or anywhere.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.420
The Signal? I never go to that place.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.090
Too much water in the sauce.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.900
You know Drake?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.540
Lives in that RV thing
in back of that shop place...

22:02.640 --> 22:04.060
on that street right off Meeker.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.540
Off Meeker?

22:05.640 --> 22:07.260
Absolutely. Hell, yes, you know it.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.220
Well, he is your best shot at this.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.900
Drake knows everything
that's going down in this town.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.020
Scary as hell, but he's whip-smart.
A good guy.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.620
I'll let him know you're coming.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.690
In the meantime,
I'll put out some feelers myself.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.940
Allen. What are you doing?

22:28.040 --> 22:30.008
Playing with crickets.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.260
Hey.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.380
What's the matter?

22:38.480 --> 22:39.720
You feel bad for it?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.140
- No.
- Then you kill one.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.340
Leave him alone.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.204
He can't kill a cricket.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.540
I don't need to.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.404
Well, I think you'd better.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.407
He's crying over an insect.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.300
Look. Sorry. Tell you what.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.980
You can shoot my gun to make up for it.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.082
I got a rabbit you can shoot in the shed.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.247
It'll be fun.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.660
I don't want to shoot a rabbit.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.300
If you don't want to get beat up...

23:18.400 --> 23:19.580
you'll shoot the rabbit.

23:19.680 --> 23:20.727
Knock it off, Mike.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.100
Seriously.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.940
Put it down, you little shit.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.020
It's actually loaded.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.860
You don't know what you're playing with.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.644
Don't point that at me.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.900
Cut it out, you nut.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.604
Put it down, you little asshole.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.540
What the hell is going on out here?

23:43.640 --> 23:45.369
Little shit pulled a gun on me.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.841
Isn't this your gun?

23:49.080 --> 23:52.580
I was gonna let him use it,
but then he pointed it at me.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.740
How many times
do I have to tell you guys...

23:54.840 --> 23:57.660
that these guns I give you
are not playthings?

23:57.760 --> 24:01.180
I have a mind to take them
all away until you grow up.

24:01.280 --> 24:03.965
Get your ass in the house.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.803
Unload this and put it away. Now.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.740
You okay, little soldier?

24:12.840 --> 24:15.460
Why did you point a gun at him?

24:15.560 --> 24:17.847
I thought it was fake.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.060
Thought we were just playing.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.700
Never point a gun at anyone.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.540
That's a rule, son.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.540
Unless, of course,
they're attacking you...

24:26.640 --> 24:29.620
then you can shoot them all you want.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.690
I think he'll remember that lesson.
Won't you?

24:34.200 --> 24:35.540
Come on.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.860
You guys should come over next weekend.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.740
We actually have
a little shooting gallery we set up...

24:41.840 --> 24:44.844
and we could teach him to really shoot.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.380
He could learn gun safety, everything.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.721
Seriously.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.444
Thanks.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.291
Son of a bitch.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.881
Goddamn it.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.740
You'll fit.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.100
I don't want to fit.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.780
Come on. It'll be fun.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.884
Here, I'll lift you up. Come on.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.140
You okay?

25:52.240 --> 25:53.651
Not really.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.300
Okay.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.980
Let me know if it hurts, okay?

25:58.080 --> 25:59.580
Yeah, it hurts.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.740
Doing great.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.842
You're almost in.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.925
There you go.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.540
Anthony, you okay?

26:11.640 --> 26:14.405
Yeah, most of me is okay.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.620
So, there's a jar on the dresser
in the bedroom.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.484
Go get it. Bring it to the window.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.250
Okay.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.820
Find it?

26:31.920 --> 26:33.445
Yeah.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.340
And there's a bottle on the floor...

26:38.440 --> 26:40.460
in the closet.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.846
Okay.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.020
I can't find it.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.646
No, it's there. Keep looking.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.886
There's no bottle in the closet.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.966
Okay, just bring the jar.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.540
Grab your backpack.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.325
Get me some shirts and a pair of pants.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.646
Okay.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.300
How can he lock you out of your own house?

27:17.400 --> 27:19.084
It's his house.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.460
I just owe him a little money, is all.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.380
He's just being pissy.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.960
So, where are we gonna stay?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.500
We'll have to stay at the house.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.700
My house?

27:30.800 --> 27:32.500
Well, it used to be
my house, too, you know.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.060
I rebuilt the thing from the ground up.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.049
Just don't tell your mom, okay?

27:39.520 --> 27:42.569
We'll have to leave before they get back.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.411
We have to go up there
for the newspapers anyway.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.848
Do Mom and Kyle still have the wagon?

28:12.960 --> 28:15.700
Yeah, but there's something wrong with it.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.540
- What?
- I don't remember.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.940
But it runs?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.407
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good enough.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.940
Can I do it?

29:29.040 --> 29:31.646
Quick now. We got places to get.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.806
No.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.163
You hit the damn charity button.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.523
Well, they told us
to do that in Catechism.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.284
Yellow?

30:13.920 --> 30:16.161
You've got to be kidding.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.980
What happened to the shelves
I built there?

30:40.080 --> 30:43.420
Kyle didn't like them,
so he took them down.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.580
He didn't like them?

30:45.680 --> 30:49.420
I mean, who doesn't like
custom built-in wood shelves?

30:49.520 --> 30:51.460
Jesus. I mean...

30:51.560 --> 30:54.220
Half of us build the world,
the other half destroy it.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.891
What the hell happened here?

30:58.640 --> 31:01.100
Kyle had an accident.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.540
He had an accident with door trim?

31:03.640 --> 31:04.687
How do you even do that?

31:04.800 --> 31:07.820
- Why didn't he fix it?
- He did.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.366
It used to be worse.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.020
You're living with a Philistine.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.580
- What's a Philistine?
- It's a religion.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.580
The religion of dumb-asses.

31:22.680 --> 31:26.860
Well, at least my cabinets are...

31:26.960 --> 31:29.440
Holy shit.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.049
- Kyle?
- Mom says it adds character.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.740
These are Kyle's tools.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.481
No, these aren't tools. These are toys.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.020
Where did he get these, the Dollar Store?

32:04.120 --> 32:05.940
Yeah.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.260
Jesus. I was just kidding.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.409
This guy is 90% puss.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.180
Do you like this Kyle?

32:17.280 --> 32:20.011
Yeah. He's pretty nice.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.443
Well, it could be worse then.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.820
You want to get the car keys?

32:27.920 --> 32:31.129
I'll put my stuff in the bedroom.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.966
Got the keys?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.123
Let's go see Drake.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.607
What the hell is that?

33:56.720 --> 33:57.860
That's Kyle's music.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.860
Your mom married a metalhead?

34:01.960 --> 34:03.500
Do you like that?

34:03.600 --> 34:05.364
A little bit.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.007
Not really.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.763
Where's that CD
I gave her for her birthday?

34:24.239 --> 34:26.780
That sounds better.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.940
Yeah. It sounds pretty good.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.420
It does sound pretty good.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.409
Let's go find my tools.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.009
Holy shit. Where did the brakes go?

34:51.080 --> 34:52.922
Yeah, that was the problem.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.500
I forgot.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.762
Mom said the brakes
were starting to go out.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.300
Brake pads? 75 bucks.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.140
275 installed.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.368
We can put them on now if you want.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.642
I'll put them on myself.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.009
Can I can borrow some tools?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.645
Let me ask my dad.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.060
Pretty good.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.731
Yeah. It stops now.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.260
It's getting late.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.489
Guess I'll have to see
this Drake guy tomorrow.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.900
- You hungry?
- Nope.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.889
I'm starving.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.260
Pancakes.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.761
That's a very good choice.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.567
And your mom was worried about us.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.460
If you have a six,
then you can ask me if I have a six.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.740
- I see.
- Then you take it and make a pair.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.500
If I've already got a pair, what do I do?

37:06.600 --> 37:08.620
You put it in that pile.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.140
Okay. Do you have a jack?

37:12.240 --> 37:13.460
Go fish.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.961
Go fish yourself.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.327
So, jab straight. Okay?

37:35.840 --> 37:38.940
No, no, no. No, no roundhouses.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.850
Keep your hands up by your face.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.940
The baboons sit and listen...

37:47.040 --> 37:49.008
to the hippos' distinct call...

37:49.120 --> 37:52.060
as they bathe and drink in the water.

37:52.160 --> 37:55.540
The hippopotamus is highly aggressive
and unpredictable...

37:55.640 --> 37:58.962
and is among the most
dangerous animals in Africa.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.020
Nevertheless, they are threatened
by habitat loss...

38:03.120 --> 38:06.363
and poaching for their meat and ivory...

38:08.440 --> 38:10.420
Wine coolers? Seriously?

38:10.520 --> 38:12.740
Make that 95% puss.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.966
What does that mean?

38:16.480 --> 38:17.820
That's good.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.980
95% puss is pretty good
for most guys these days.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.580
You can't take that.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.126
They'll think I did it.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.720
We have bottled water.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.940
Well, you stay here.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.170
I got to look for something in the garage.

39:14.240 --> 39:16.220
Did you find it?

39:16.320 --> 39:18.740
- Find what?
- I don't know.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.763
No.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.460
It's cold in here.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.050
You're sweating, Dad.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.180
Listen...

39:31.280 --> 39:33.620
I got to run out a sec.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.085
You'll be okay, right?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.180
Where are the keys?

39:39.280 --> 39:40.645
I don't know.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.940
Want me to call somebody?

39:48.040 --> 39:49.740
No.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.660
- Go to bed.
- I want to stay here with you.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.491
I'll be okay. Just go.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.402
Anthony. Go to bed, now.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.523
Please help my dad.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.660
There's something wrong with him...

40:12.760 --> 40:14.569
but you can probably see that.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.321
Make him better if you can.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.805
Amen.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.811
Jesus Christ!

40:33.320 --> 40:36.380
How will I know if you don't tell me?

40:36.480 --> 40:38.780
You know, we've talked
about all this before.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.211
It's just not all my fault.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.580
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
What do you want from me?

40:48.680 --> 40:51.180
Seriously, that doesn't make any sense.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.780
Why would I do that?

40:52.880 --> 40:54.769
What are you doing?

40:56.080 --> 40:57.100
Dad?

40:57.200 --> 41:00.170
You always do this.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.410
- Dad?
- I can't.

41:19.880 --> 41:22.780
- Hello?
- Otto. It's Anthony.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.848
There's something wrong with my dad.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.020
What do you mean?

41:27.120 --> 41:28.724
- I think he's drunk.
- What's he doing?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.340
He's talking to people who aren't there.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.060
All right. Well, just hang on.
I'll be right there.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.220
We're at my mom's house.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.005
- I'll just be a few minutes.
- Okay.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.851
I got to go. I got to go, I got to go.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.420
- I got to go.
- Dad. Dad, stop.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.140
Don't go out there. Don't go out there.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.260
Dad.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.249
Dad, Otto's coming.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.260
- He'll be here any minute.
- Otto?

42:00.360 --> 42:02.522
He says you should stay here.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.020
Is Dorothy gone?

42:06.120 --> 42:09.522
Yeah. But Otto's coming.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.440
Okay.

42:32.680 --> 42:33.740
Hello?

42:33.840 --> 42:35.444
We're in here.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.460
Hey, Walt. How you doing, buddy?

42:43.560 --> 42:45.340
- Otto?
- Yeah.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.940
Time for bed, don't you think?

42:48.040 --> 42:50.980
Come on. Let me help you.

42:51.080 --> 42:55.085
Yeah. There we go.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.260
Yep. There you go.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.600
All right.

42:59.720 --> 43:01.404
Okay.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.091
Yeah.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.367
I'll be right back.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.803
Upstairs.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.020
Well...

43:28.120 --> 43:29.770
He's finally out.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.260
Listen, Anthony.

43:35.360 --> 43:38.340
Your dad is not drunk.

43:38.440 --> 43:42.020
He's having withdrawal.
Do you know what that is?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.820
No.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.100
It means that he is acting funny...

43:47.200 --> 43:48.980
not because he's been drinking.

43:49.080 --> 43:52.140
He's acting funny because
he hasn't been drinking.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.020
You understand?

43:54.120 --> 43:55.281
No.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.580
Sometimes...

43:59.680 --> 44:03.241
when adults stop drinking...

44:04.640 --> 44:08.020
it makes their minds play tricks on them.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.300
See, your mother said...

44:10.400 --> 44:13.340
that he couldn't see you anymore
if he didn't stop drinking.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.380
He was in the taverns.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.380
But he's been drinking root beer.

44:17.480 --> 44:19.300
He's trying.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.500
Your dad is a good man.

44:21.600 --> 44:27.100
He's got some demons,
but, you know, we all do.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.060
He'll be asleep
for several hours, I think...

44:29.160 --> 44:32.540
and when he wakes up,
he's gonna be hurting...

44:32.640 --> 44:34.900
but he shouldn't be
acting strange anymore.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.820
Now, I got to get home for Beulah...

44:38.920 --> 44:40.580
but if you need me, you call me.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.820
Okay?

44:42.920 --> 44:45.740
I'll be here real quick. You promise?

44:45.840 --> 44:47.340
Yeah.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.171
All right. You're in charge.

44:51.720 --> 44:52.846
Thanks, Otto.

44:52.960 --> 44:55.500
Anytime, partner.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.841
Get some sleep, you hear?

46:57.160 --> 46:58.844
The Griffins get one.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.060
The Griffins?

47:03.160 --> 47:05.447
I didn't think they could read.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.980
- See their house?
- Yeah.

47:12.080 --> 47:15.260
The gutter's falling off,
the paint's shot.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.330
Garbage in the yard.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.766
Get off your ass and fix it. Clean it up.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.740
When we first moved here...

47:26.840 --> 47:30.220
this neighborhood had some pride.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.322
What's the matter with people?

47:33.680 --> 47:34.966
I don't know.

47:35.080 --> 47:39.420
The Griffins represent everything
that's gone wrong with this world.

47:39.520 --> 47:42.444
It's immoral, is what it is.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.780
Your generation's gonna have
to make it right again.

47:47.880 --> 47:49.820
It's up to you.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.740
- Okay.
- You know?

47:52.840 --> 47:57.209
I'm sorry my generation
screwed it up so bad.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.620
It's all right.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.740
No, not really.

48:01.840 --> 48:04.180
You know, our parents
built a great country...

48:04.280 --> 48:07.204
and we couldn't even maintain it for you.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.848
I'm sorry.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.050
They get one, too.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.180
You know, I think maybe you're right.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.080
I think I can see your other universes.

48:42.280 --> 48:45.762
I just hope they make
more sense than this one.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.844
I...

48:58.840 --> 49:03.129
I don't remember much from last night.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.364
I didn't hurt you, did I?

49:10.320 --> 49:12.049
No.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.740
- Dad?
- Yeah?

49:25.840 --> 49:28.241
I don't want to have Communion.

49:28.360 --> 49:29.660
Why not?

49:29.760 --> 49:32.047
I don't want to eat Jesus.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.220
Listen...

49:38.320 --> 49:40.420
- You're not really eating Jesus.
- They say you are.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.340
No, no, no. It's not Jesus.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.442
It's just a cracker.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.700
It is?

49:46.800 --> 49:50.500
And it's not Jesus' blood either.
It's grape juice.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.524
You know, it's crackers and grape juice.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.460
I don't get it.

49:56.560 --> 50:00.087
You will. Someday.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.208
Why don't you go to church anymore?

50:08.480 --> 50:09.900
I went enough already.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.660
I don't want you to go to hell.

50:11.760 --> 50:14.161
Listen, I'm going to tell you something.

50:14.280 --> 50:17.580
- Don't ever tell your mom, okay?
- Okay.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.420
These things that they tell you...

50:19.520 --> 50:22.205
they might be true,
they might not be true.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.620
What do you think?

50:24.720 --> 50:27.420
I think that I don't know...

50:27.520 --> 50:28.900
and neither do they.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.368
No matter what they say. They don't know.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.500
So, just in case...

50:35.600 --> 50:38.260
maybe you should take Communion.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.300
What about Confirmation?

50:40.400 --> 50:42.780
Won't hurt you.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.340
You know, just do it.

50:45.440 --> 50:46.980
For your mom.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.580
And once you're grown,
you can do what you want.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.860
- I can?
- Absolutely.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.460
You know, you can skip church...

50:54.560 --> 50:56.740
and listen to shitty metalheads...

50:56.840 --> 50:58.080
if you want, God forbid.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.620
Just...

51:01.720 --> 51:04.380
you know, listen to what they say...

51:04.480 --> 51:07.340
and then decide for yourself.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.728
Do what you think is right, okay?

51:12.280 --> 51:14.009
Okay.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.340
Okay.

51:24.440 --> 51:25.660
So, while you're in church...

51:25.760 --> 51:27.444
I'm gonna go visit this Drake fella.

51:27.560 --> 51:31.180
If I'm late, just wait for me right here.

51:31.280 --> 51:34.124
I don't want to go to church.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.380
But you have to.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.300
You told me to make my own decisions.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.620
- Well, not yet.
- Why not?

51:42.720 --> 51:45.180
I said when you grow up.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.020
You told me to think about it,
and I thought about it.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.884
Well, you're thinking about it too much.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.540
Look, I promised your mom
that you'd go to church.

51:53.640 --> 51:55.220
I'll tell her you took me.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.500
No, no, no, no. That's not how it works.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.285
Shit, Father Lyons. Get down.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.201
Okay, now get in there.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.563
I'll go if you go.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.420
Hey.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.060
You must be Walt.

52:39.160 --> 52:40.380
I'm Drake.

52:40.480 --> 52:42.060
- You talked to Vaughn?
- I did.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.340
He caught me up. Man, I'm on it.

52:44.440 --> 52:47.020
I'm on the case, all right?
This is what I do.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.300
Are you a detective?

52:48.400 --> 52:50.220
No. I'm a drywaller.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.220
- What's your name?
- Anthony.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.900
Anthony. What do you do?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.420
I go to school.

52:55.520 --> 52:58.060
All right, keep doing that.
Make sure he keeps doing that.

52:58.160 --> 53:00.700
I got five names last night.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.165
People are already talking.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.300
- They are?
- Yeah.

53:04.400 --> 53:05.620
Can you help us now?

53:05.720 --> 53:08.740
It would be an honor
to help any friend of Vaughn's.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.380
That guy's done so much for me.

53:10.480 --> 53:12.700
I'll co-pilot, okay?
That means I got to ride shotgun.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.060
- You cool with that?
- Yeah.

53:14.160 --> 53:16.322
All right, let's go, come on. Here we go.

53:20.480 --> 53:23.060
Walt, you wanna drive straight, okay?

53:23.160 --> 53:24.889
Make it look like you're driving
down the street.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.940
It's exciting, right, Anthony?

53:29.040 --> 53:30.201
Yeah.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.220
Who gave you these leads?

53:32.320 --> 53:34.500
Well, I know half the tradesmen in Kent...

53:34.600 --> 53:35.860
and I know all the thieves.

53:35.960 --> 53:38.140
All right.

53:38.240 --> 53:41.540
Okay, we're coming up on one now,
so ease on up here.

53:41.640 --> 53:44.740
I was worried about bringing Anthony,
but this guy is an old soul.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.700
I'm glad he's here, because this is
life experience. This is great. Okay.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.180
See the grey one in the driveway?

53:50.280 --> 53:51.930
- The grey car?
- Yeah, right there.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.060
- Here?
- Yeah.

53:53.160 --> 53:56.140
Park across the driveway
so they can't pull out.

53:56.240 --> 54:00.060
Let me do all the talking. Remember
the INXS lyric "Listen like thieves"?

54:00.160 --> 54:03.180
That's what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna do the talking.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.203
Here we go. Okay.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.444
What's up, guys? Can I help you?

54:13.800 --> 54:16.246
Go ahead, Walt. Ask him straight out.

54:18.720 --> 54:19.940
Are you...

54:20.040 --> 54:21.804
Who are we looking for?

54:22.960 --> 54:25.300
Have him tell you his supposed real name.

54:25.400 --> 54:27.687
What's going on here, fellas?

54:28.520 --> 54:31.500
Yeah, someone stole a toolbox of mine...

54:31.600 --> 54:34.500
and someone else said
that you might know something about it.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.580
You're accusing me of stealing your tools?

54:37.680 --> 54:38.740
No.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.060
Yes. Walter. Don't let him smoke you.

54:41.160 --> 54:44.180
Sir, we have evidence that, if true...

54:44.280 --> 54:46.442
you know, indicts you, more or less.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.940
This is your lucky day. You know why?

54:51.040 --> 54:54.340
Because normally
I'd kick your ass right now.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.660
But kind of in a good mood...

54:56.760 --> 55:00.003
because we've been camping
all week and we just got home.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.700
Drake, can I talk to you?

55:03.800 --> 55:06.531
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

55:08.280 --> 55:10.220
Yeah, that way.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.324
After you unload the car,
let's go inside and get cleaned up.

55:15.040 --> 55:18.020
This guy doesn't look like
he's jacking tools out of trucks.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.100
Yeah, I'm starting to have my doubts...

55:20.200 --> 55:23.180
so let's move his name
a little further down the list.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.420
Yeah, let's do that.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.340
Good call, all right? Excellent audible.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.940
I apologize. Have a good day.

55:29.040 --> 55:31.740
I'm a Boeing engineer.
How do I even get on your radar?

55:31.840 --> 55:33.700
Yeah, it's my mistake.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.167
I'm sorry to trouble you, sir.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.340
That was on me. Okay?

55:46.440 --> 55:49.125
I should not have trusted
the guy that gave me that name.

55:49.240 --> 55:51.180
- He's a nut.
- Who gave you the tip?

55:51.280 --> 55:53.260
You don't want to know.
Here's the good news.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.260
I know all the other names on this list.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.580
All the other ones, I know them.

55:56.680 --> 55:59.740
They're in the building trades.
They know the tools, okay?

55:59.840 --> 56:02.260
So let's just...
This guy, let's go to Central.

56:02.360 --> 56:05.420
- Maybe we should just forget this.
- I'm sorry.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.380
This was a bad start, I know...

56:07.480 --> 56:11.860
but I want to help you
and Vaughn find your man.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.940
Don't you want to check out
one more name on this list?

56:14.040 --> 56:15.660
Yeah, I don't know anyone on there.

56:15.760 --> 56:16.980
It's good.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.401
I'm glad you don't know them,
because these are criminals.

56:19.520 --> 56:22.460
I'm gonna take you back home, Drake.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.642
I appreciate your help.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.806
- You okay, Drake?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

56:42.920 --> 56:46.260
I'm just, you know, never been a quitter.

56:46.360 --> 56:48.500
Right?

56:48.600 --> 56:50.260
God, slow down. Walt, Walt, Walt.

56:50.360 --> 56:51.500
- What?
- That's Freddy Johnson.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.140
His name is on my list, okay?

56:54.240 --> 56:56.660
I've known him all my life.
Let me take him down.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.620
Okay, listen. He works with carpenters.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.980
He steals.
His name came up from all my sources.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.764
Watch this.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.900
Ready or not, here I come.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.048
Get away from me, Drake.

57:13.680 --> 57:16.180
What do you know about
the finishing tools stolen yesterday?

57:16.280 --> 57:18.140
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Why are you running?

57:18.240 --> 57:20.180
- Because you're an insane person.
- Hey, let him up.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.740
One second, one second,

57:21.840 --> 57:24.060
Look, I know that you know.
Even if you didn't do it...

57:24.160 --> 57:26.180
you better start talking, Freddy,
or I'm gonna mess you up.

57:26.280 --> 57:27.340
I don't know anything.

57:27.440 --> 57:30.808
Freddy, you know what I can do.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.140
Okay, okay, okay.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.660
You know the Thuringer brothers, right?

57:36.760 --> 57:38.900
Yeah. They're on the list.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.580
Yeah. They took them.

57:40.680 --> 57:42.580
Do you know what they did with them?

57:42.680 --> 57:44.260
- I just heard about it.
- From who?

57:44.360 --> 57:46.380
I can't say, but it's solid.

57:46.480 --> 57:50.140
They said the Thuringer brothers
were talking about it, laughing, even.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.480
Where did they steal them?

57:54.080 --> 57:55.127
A tavern?

57:58.800 --> 58:00.820
Okay, let him go, Drake.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.260
- If you're lying...
- I'm just saying what I heard.

58:03.360 --> 58:04.850
Can I go now, officer?

58:04.960 --> 58:07.167
Funny, Freddy. Yeah.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.600
So, when we get there,
should I do the talking?

58:16.720 --> 58:18.420
No, Walt, let me do the talking, okay?

58:18.520 --> 58:20.260
I know these guys,
and they don't scare me.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.980
Well, it's just that first guy...

58:22.080 --> 58:23.411
Yeah, okay, that threw me off...

58:23.520 --> 58:27.020
because I thought I knew who the guy was
and it turned out to be another guy.

58:27.120 --> 58:29.180
This one, I'm on it, I got it, okay?

58:29.280 --> 58:32.460
Just pull down
this little alley, right here.

58:32.560 --> 58:34.700
All right, there you go. Okay.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.245
Okay.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.048
Stay in the car.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.241
I mean it.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.060
These guys are slow. All right?

58:47.160 --> 58:48.260
They're dimwits, really.

58:48.360 --> 58:49.930
They'll indict themselves.

58:51.200 --> 58:52.940
- Hey, Drake, how you doing?
- Hi, Drake.

58:53.040 --> 58:54.900
Walt, this is Tucker and Trout.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.380
This is Walt.

58:56.480 --> 58:59.882
This is the guy whose toolbox you stole.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.260
What?

59:04.360 --> 59:06.060
Guys, we have refutable evidence...

59:06.160 --> 59:09.580
that you took the guy's toolbox.
Just own up.

59:09.680 --> 59:12.286
I don't want any trouble,
but I need my tools.

59:15.880 --> 59:18.020
Hey, Drake, are you on meth again?

59:18.120 --> 59:20.940
Tucker, don't change the subject, okay?

59:21.040 --> 59:22.540
Yes, I'm on meth, okay?

59:22.640 --> 59:25.500
That has nothing to do
with what we're talking about.

59:25.600 --> 59:26.580
What the hell?

59:26.680 --> 59:29.809
- We have it from a direct witness...
- We don't have a direct witness.

59:29.920 --> 59:31.980
We heard it. He was a direct witness...

59:32.080 --> 59:36.340
- No, Drake, he was lying.
- He wasn't lying. These guys stole it.

59:36.440 --> 59:39.808
- And it's about to get real, all right?
- I've had enough of this, Drake.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.243
Hi, Mom.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.091
Yeah. Everything's fine.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.980
Nothing, really.

59:55.080 --> 59:58.323
Yeah, we took the papers out
and went to church.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.460
Yeah, I'll tell Dad. Okay.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.620
All right.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.740
I love you, too. Bye.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.921
Okay.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.931
Guys, let's all take a breath here.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.580
- Trout, put the gun away.
- What?

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.180
Can't you see this guy's hurting?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.740
And be nice to Drake.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.660
He's got his own problems, obviously.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.410
You know better.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.140
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you will be. Okay?

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.620
Drake, it's over.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.700
- We got them dead to rights.
- No, not really.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.580
Okay, hey, Trout, I don't care
if you have a gun, I'm gonna look around.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.660
- Drake.
- Point a gun at me. I don't care.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.380
Hi, stolen merchandise. Hello.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.540
I'm sorry.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.166
I don't really know Drake.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.180
You know, I mean...

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.660
he seems pretty decent for a stoner.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.420
Yeah, he is.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.820
We love Drake...

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.366
but he just gets
some funny ideas sometimes.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.780
Hey.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.484
Hi.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.380
Drake?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.060
Hey, come on.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.220
We'll take you home.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.051
Yeah, Drake. We wanna take you.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.460
They did it. I know they did.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.220
No, they didn't steal my tools.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.060
Okay, well, then,
one of these other people...

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.220
No, Drake. This time we're really done.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.448
I'm taking you home.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.580
I just wanted to help.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.940
We know that.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.220
Not many people would've done
what you just did for us.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.300
That's right. Most people
can't even be bothered, you know?

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.660
And I... I care too much.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.140
That's my problem.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.369
It's a burden and it's a virtue, you know?

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.290
Well, the important thing is,
you tried your best...

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.100
and we appreciate that.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.201
Don't we, Anthony?

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.051
Yeah, we really appreciate
how much you tried your best.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.740
Yeah, man, 'cause that's
the story of my life...

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.180
is I always, I always
try my best, you know?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.660
And that's where I get in trouble.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.842
This one time... You'll like this.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.260
There was this lady...

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.940
her grandmother made
these German apple pancakes.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.780
She wanted this recipe,
she couldn't find it...

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.700
so I go, there's a website,
it's called "Stormfront"...

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.100
and it's like a neo-Nazi site.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.980
I'm not a neo-Nazi, but I figured
"German apple pancakes"...

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.540
maybe they'd have these old things.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.980
So I started posting on there...

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.926
and the next thing I know,
I get this call from the FBI...

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.765
All right. All right.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.690
That was fun, guys. That was fun.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.380
Well, you know,
you wouldn't have a few bucks, maybe...

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.060
for my troubles, or...

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.580
I don't really have a couple
of bucks to spare, Drake.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.180
Well, that's cool. You know, that's cool.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.886
I was glad to help, and... okay.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.284
Drake.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.700
Man, thank you.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.540
Guys, thank you. Hey, you know what?

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.180
Drop by any time you want. Come visit.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.380
And Anthony, keep doing school, okay?

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:26.860
- 'Cause that's my theme song.
- All right.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.041
Bye, Drake.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.888
I want to show you something.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.940
Is this okay?

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.380
Don't worry. They know me.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.324
Doesn't look like anyone's home, anyway.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.210
See this?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.220
I built it.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.780
It's called a trellis.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.940
You know, usually
they're simple and boxy...

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.700
but I added some carvings...

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.700
did some detail work.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.087
Wow. Looks pretty good, Dad.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.460
I think so.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.540
You know, it makes a statement.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.460
Says somebody's been here, somebody cares.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.380
They seemed to like it.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.260
I called the police.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.980
- Ma'am, It's me, Walt.
- Get out of my yard.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.740
My dog is trained to attack.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.366
- No, I built...
- Get them, Daisy.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.620
Are we in trouble?

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.484
Don't worry. It's fine.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.970
Hands where I can see them.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.140
I'm sorry. I was just showing my son...

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.810
License and registration.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.260
See, I built the trellis, and...

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.805
And your license.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.740
I'm sorry. I don't have it on me.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.411
Are you Kyle Zabler?

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.130
Yes, officer. I am Kyle Zabler.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.980
And this is my son... stepson.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.940
See, I built her trellis and...

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.326
This your stepdad?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.860
Here's what I'm gonna do.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.220
I'm going to ask you to try and stay out
of other people's yards, okay?

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.802
But I am gonna write you up
for driving without a license.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.570
Fair enough.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.881
That trellis lady had no idea who I was.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.140
Worked at her house for a week,
didn't even remember me.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.220
She should've.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.891
Maybe she's a Philistine.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.860
I liked your bookshelves, too.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.980
Kyle didn't.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.540
Did he say why he didn't like them?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.180
- He said he didn't like the color.
- The color?

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.011
They were pine. They were wood color.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.900
You try and stay out of trouble now.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.890
Yes, officer.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.580
What do we do now?

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.860
Got any homework?

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.325
Yeah.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.940
Your report card.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.180
How did you do?

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.900
Okay.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.970
"A", "A", "A".

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.568
Straight "A"s. Wow.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.260
Listen, did Kyle...

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.460
have any leftover trim
for the kitchen entry?

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.340
Yeah.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.220
You want to help me fix it?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.641
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.008
We'll fix that sticking door, too.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.368
You want to put a little putty in there?

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.300
You see this edge here?

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:28.580
- That's called a reveal.
- A reveal?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.060
Yeah, 'cause it reveals
some of the piece below it.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.020
You know, if it were even,
it would be called flush...

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.620
because it's flush.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.720
Flush.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.020
And if it protrudes, like this one...

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.609
then it's called proud.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.020
Proud.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.180
Yeah, 'cause it's sticking out...

01:08:45.279 --> 01:08:47.044
like it's boastful, right?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.700
You see, carpentry is only
the illusion of perfection...

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.979
but we can come close.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.162
They say God lives in the details.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:02.089
He does?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.408
Well, if he doesn't live in the details,
where does he live?

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.563
I don't know.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.640
See...

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.488
bad workmanship is a sin.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.844
People don't appreciate
quality work like they used to.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.340
But you, you notice things...

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:24.220
you give them some thought, right?

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.340
I think so.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.380
See that chair?

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.779
Someone built that chair, and not just
one person, several people helped.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.220
Remember that. Real people.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.779
You know, when you go over a bridge...

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.359
think about what it took
to build that bridge.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.620
Okay.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.006
You ever think about the people
who made your pants?

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:49.580
- No.
- Well, think about them.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.819
Now, Kyle, he's okay for a pud...

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:57.060
but I'm sure he never
gives things any thought.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.860
Not because he doesn't care.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.884
He just doesn't have the imagination.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.211
- You don't want to be like that, right?
- No way.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.140
Hey, Dad...

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.860
can Allen come over next time?

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.060
Who's Allen?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.740
The boy at your friend's house.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.260
What friend's house?

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.660
- Yesterday.
- You mean Vaughn?

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.700
He's not my friend. I barely know him.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.420
I just heard he might know
who stole my tools.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.220
I thought he was one
of your friends at the tavern.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.820
What are you talking about?

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.940
When I was going inside to The Signal...

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.280
he was coming out.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.820
Are you sure it was the same guy?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.460
Yeah. Allen was in the truck.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.801
Why didn't you tell me this?

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.410
I thought you saw him.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.648
He never goes there.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.820
And then he pawns crazy Drake off on us?

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.527
- Whip-smart, my ass.
- You think he stole your tools?

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.171
Get your coat.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.445
Where's your dad?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.321
Vaughn.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.020
What did your dad do with the tools?

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.900
My dad didn't take the tools. Roger did.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.380
Who's Roger?

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.403
The guy that was with my dad.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.220
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.860
I wanted to, but my dad
would've killed me.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.200
Come here.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.140
I'm the one who was helping you
find the damn tools.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.220
- Where are they, you son of a bitch?
- I told you. I don't know.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.460
I don't know where they are.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.300
You boys get out of here.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.420
- Dad, I think you should tell him.
- What?

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.820
Tell him what Roger said.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.740
What Roger said?

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.260
Yeah, Roger said
that Vaughn stole your tools.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.020
What?

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.020
Now, that's a goddamn lie.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.380
Roger's the one who stole your damn tools.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.100
Why should I believe you?

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.380
It's true.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.084
Roger went into your truck and took them.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.362
Dad told him to stop.

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.611
You believe this boy?

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.688
Where doses he live?

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.260
Are you Roger?

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.460
What do you want?

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.483
I want my tools.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.340
- Okay.
- Where are they?

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.580
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.780
Don't be sorry, just give me my tools.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.460
I don't have them. I pawned them.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.900
I checked the pawn shop.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.180
No, I took them to Pete's Pawn in Renton.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.660
I figured you'd never go there.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.860
- Give me the money.
- I don't have it.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.580
How much did you get?

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.365
$200, but I spent it.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.140
- I want the $200.
- I haven't worked in six months.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.780
I got three kids. We needed food.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.211
Get off of him.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.448
Get off of him. He's got heart trouble.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.330
- No, no, no, no.
- Get off.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.366
Just give me my money.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.380
We don't have it anymore. It's gone.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.980
Well, then give me something to sell.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.460
We've sold everything.
There's nothing left.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.220
Are you okay, honey?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.322
I'm fine.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.740
Look, we're done here.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.980
We're going back to Idaho
to live with my parents.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.180
When we get back on our feet,
I will send you the money.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.700
I need the money now.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.860
That's not gonna happen.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.860
Look, he stole your tools,
and that was wrong...

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.980
but we're broke.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.740
Look around here.
Do you see anything worth selling?

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.925
The only thing we got left is that mower,
and it don't even work.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.900
Come on, Anthony. Let's go.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.860
I'm sorry.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.406
Write down your address
and I'll send you the money.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.328
Forget it.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.700
I'm coming with you.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.689
No.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.780
Hey. How you doing?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.530
Hey.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.700
Are you the owner?

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.740
- Pete.
- Yeah?

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.808
Got a guy.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.900
- Hi.
- Yeah?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.300
Those are my tools.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.020
They were stolen.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.060
Right. You got a receipt?

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.020
They're very old. They were my dad's.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.620
I don't have a receipt.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.260
Well, that's your problem, then.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.940
I can tell you everything
that's in there without opening it.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.380
Yeah, I got guys coming in here
all the time, claiming stuff is theirs.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.245
Those are my tools.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.780
Then call a cop. Or a lawyer.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.220
Maybe you didn't know before
you bought them, but you know now.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.540
Those are stolen goods.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.300
Well, call the authorities.
We'll have an investigation, then.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.500
That's how things work in this country.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.580
How much did you put on them?

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.808
Four hundred bucks.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.140
- Anthony?
- Hey. What are you doing?

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.180
- Come back here.
- Anthony, run.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.645
- Run.
- Get out of the way.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.129
Keep running, Anthony.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.689
Anthony, run.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.721
Get the kid, Darren.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:13.900
Anthony...

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.368
Stop it. Leave him alone.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.404
Leave my dad alone, goddamn it!

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.100
Get away from my boy. What are you doing?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.884
Get away from my boy.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.460
You.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.820
You don't even think
about coming back here...

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.020
'cause I'm not selling you
these tools for any price.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.885
Now, go on. Get out of here.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.687
Are you sure you're not hurt?

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.289
You got blood, Dad.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.084
I'm okay.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.740
Come on.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.649
Let's go home.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.604
They got pop.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.249
You want anything?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.568
No, thank you.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.609
Me neither.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.290
I'm back.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.020
Hey. Great timing. We just got home.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.820
- Hi, bud.
- Hi.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.740
- How are you?
- Good. Dad's here.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.540
- Hey.
- Hey, Walt.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.020
Hi.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.380
So, how did it go?

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.380
Good. Wouldn't you say, Anthony?

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.860
Yeah, good. Nothing happened.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.180
Well, come on in for a minute. Sit down.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.900
You haven't seen the place, have you?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.580
Well, I...

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.380
I'm sorry, I mean since you lived here.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.740
Yeah, I haven't really been here since...

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.380
- Looks good.
- Yeah.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.380
Sit down. Sit down.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.323
Here.

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.700
So, what did you two
get up to this weekend?

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.140
Just messed around.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.340
Played some video games. At Dad's house.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.260
Really? You have video games now?

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.488
Yeah, I got them for Anthony.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.404
But I enjoy them, you know.
It's fun to kill aliens.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.140
Did you get enough to eat?

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.260
Yeah. We ate some.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.684
How about I'll make a snack,
and we'll have dinner later?

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.300
- Good?
- Walt, you want to stay for dinner?

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.767
No, I'm good. Thanks.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.660
Hey, Walt, do you want
to see my ham radio?

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.140
No.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.450
I mean, you know,
maybe someday, but not today.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.180
Hey, Walt, Bonnie tells me you've run
into kind of a rough patch...

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.660
and I want you to know
that if you need any money or anything...

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.180
don't be afraid to ask us.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.020
That's very nice
of you, Kyle, but I'm doing okay.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.220
Great.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.700
- I just want you to...
- No.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:36.820
Thanks.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.410
Okay.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.580
I really like what you've done
with this house.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.180
It's really nice.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.140
That's much appreciated, Kyle.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.060
And those kitchen cabinets?

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.730
Gorgeous.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.220
Well...

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.060
we had a great weekend.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.540
Yeah.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.020
We had a good weekend.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.047
We learned a lot about how to show
appreciation for one another.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.644
I don't mean just physically.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.180
No. No.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.060
It's all about communication.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.525
Telling the truth.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:22.900
Just be honest with each other.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.889
That's what the experts say.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.361
Isn't that right, partner?

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.323
I don't know.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.860
Hey, Walt, do you want a beer?

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.260
You have beer?

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.569
Yeah, I keep it tucked away
in a little fridge in the garage.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.926
Not for me, thanks.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.366
Would you mind if I had one?

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.688
Okay, I'll just go get one,
and I'll be right back.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.360
What happened to my sticky door?

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.900
Walt, can we talk outside, please?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.286
Buddy.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.011
What were you doing
in my house this weekend?

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.180
When I brought Anthony over
for the newspapers...

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.180
I had to go to the bathroom.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.001
You always fix the door trim
when you go to the bathroom?

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.606
Not always.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.140
I'm sorry, I...

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.140
I came in, I saw the bad work...

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.300
I couldn't help myself.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.140
Right. And I suppose...

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:51.323
that made you so hungry
that you had to make pancakes?

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.283
Hey.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.721
Why don't you have a seat, bud?

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.326
What's the money for?

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.980
It's for Dad.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.300
Why?

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:44.020
I don't want to say.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.700
I know he was here this weekend.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.484
I know everything that happened.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.204
That's why I want to give Dad the money...

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.007
for the car.

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.100
The car?

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.740
For fixing the brakes.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.162
Your dad was driving my car this weekend?

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.482
I thought you knew.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.500
How much were the brakes?

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.020
$75.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.340
But then there's labor.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.011
For his time.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.210
So...

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.700
$325 for his time?

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.370
Yeah.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.880
That's probably fair, don't you think?

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.730
I think so.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.691
Is there anything else you want
to tell me about this weekend?

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.220
No.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.420
That's about it.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.760
It was actually pretty boring.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.244
Okay.

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.580
Do you think Dad can borrow
the car for a few days?

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.001
Until his truck gets fixed?

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.246
Yeah.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.442
All right, what the hell?

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.940
Kyle? Would you mind if Walt...

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.820
took the wagon for a couple of days...

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.540
and put new brakes on it?

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.860
We talked and he said all good, right?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.450
You really don't mind?

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:44.250
I'd be happy to help.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.700
Great. That's nice.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:48.290
Thank you. Here's the keys.

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.220
Okay, I'd better get going.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.460
Dad? Remember you said
you'd take me back to your house...

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.846
to get some stuff I forgot?

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.020
- Is that okay, Mom?
- Okay.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.860
But no messing around.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.620
Just there and back.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.540
Okay, I'll see you later.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.740
Hey, Walt?

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.740
I really enjoy seeing you.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.286
Thank you for fixing the car.

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.770
You bet.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:35.860
Okay, buddy, what's going on?

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.180
Now we can get your tools back.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.540
Where did you get this?

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.020
Mom.

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.620
- No, we're taking it back.
- Well, it's for fixing the car.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.140
You weren't supposed to say anything.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.780
She said...

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.008
She was gonna ask you to fix it anyways.

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.580
Really?

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:57.284
Yeah.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.247
Let me borrow your phone.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.780
There's no way that guy
will sell them to us.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.420
Mom and Kyle will help.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.682
No, I can't do that.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.846
Otto isn't answering.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.924
I know.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.087
Go that way.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.969
Stay here. I'll be right back.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.288
Give him the money, Dad.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.140
Okay.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.100
So, you know where they are...

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.620
and what they look like?

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.940
Yes, sir.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.090
Just say it's for your dad's birthday.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.969
Hey! I should've known it was you.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.930
Darren.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.485
Darren!

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.260
Hey.

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.980
Come back here, you. Hey!

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.491
Stop. Stop!

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.940
What happened in there?

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.260
When I went in, he was talking to a man...

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.740
so I went right for the tools
and took them and ran.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.683
Let me take a look at these.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:07.210
Thank you, Allen.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.688
Thank you so much.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.489
This is good.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.122
My dad, he's probably still passed out...

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.402
but if he sees me, I'll get in trouble.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.082
Sorry I hit you with the glove.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.100
Hey.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.540
Maybe I'll take you and Anthony
to a game some time.

01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.140
Sure. This was fun.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.660
Bye.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.330
- Bye, Allen.
- Bye.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.885
We should make one more stop.

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.460
Bless me, for I have sinned.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.700
It's been one day
since my last confession.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.689
These are my sins.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.500
I lied to my mom and my dad.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.524
I stole... a lot.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.640
I coveted.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.700
I said bad words.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.020
I didn't keep the Lord's day holy.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.460
I shouldn't have lied
to the policewoman...

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.040
or pointed the gun at Mike.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.888
Let's see.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.729
What else?

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.980
So...

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.243
what do you want to do next weekend?

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.980
Next weekend is First Communion
and Confirmation.

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.860
Yeah.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:04.530
You gonna do it?

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.660
Yeah.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.205
For Mom.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.326
Are you gonna come?

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.460
Yeah.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:20.166
Yeah, I'll be there. For sure.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.140
Where are you gonna stay?

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:34.540
You know, maybe Otto
can put me up for a few days.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.220
I got a paycheck coming
at the end of the week...

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.325
so, you know, I can get my house back.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:45.686
That's good, Dad.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.770
You were right, Dad.

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.780
It was my fault.

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.723
What was?

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.420
I left the truck alone.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.620
No. No, Anthony.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.620
It wasn't your fault.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.166
No, I left it unlocked. It was me.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.380
Your dad messed up.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.620
Hey.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.580
You're a good boy.

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.460
You know? You did good.

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.961
You got my tools back.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.740
So...

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.420
see you next weekend?

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.524
See you next weekend, buddy.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.051
Hey.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.288
You behave yourself, now.
