( â™ª )

00:10.051 --> 00:12.554
(Theme music, country style)

00:20.354 --> 00:22.648
(Sizzling)

00:22.731 --> 00:25.108
(Exhaling)

00:27.486 --> 00:30.071
(Ice rattling in glass)

00:32.700 --> 00:33.951
Bubbles:

00:32.700 --> 00:33.951
Check it out, boys.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.202
(Singing)

00:34.034 --> 00:35.202
Hollywood!

00:35.285 --> 00:36.704
Ricky:

00:35.285 --> 00:36.704
Fucking awesome!

00:36.787 --> 00:38.747
Bubbles: (Singing)

00:36.787 --> 00:38.747
Hollywood!

00:38.831 --> 00:42.167
Ricky:

00:38.831 --> 00:42.167
I do like those fucking

00:38.831 --> 00:42.167
trees with no branches.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.836
Sun trees.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.212
Julian:

00:43.919 --> 00:45.212
Rick, they're palm trees.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.714
Bubbles:

00:45.295 --> 00:46.714
Palm trees, Ricky.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.757
I'm feeling good

00:46.797 --> 00:48.757
about today, boys.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.757
Me too.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.801
You know what?

00:48.841 --> 00:50.801
I am fucking

00:48.841 --> 00:50.801
pumped up for today!

00:50.885 --> 00:52.511
We're going to destroy

00:50.885 --> 00:52.511
these tasks,

00:52.594 --> 00:54.388
we're going to make

00:52.594 --> 00:54.388
a shit ton of money

00:52.594 --> 00:54.388
fair and square

00:54.471 --> 00:55.848
and we're going to make

00:54.471 --> 00:55.848
the best fucking video

00:55.931 --> 00:57.516
we possibly can, man.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.852
That's the attitude

00:57.599 --> 00:59.852
I like to hear right there.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.730
And in the spirit of

00:59.935 --> 01:02.730
fair and square, boys,

01:02.813 --> 01:04.481
everything we make

01:02.813 --> 01:04.481
on the tasks today,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.483
we're splitting it three ways.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.778
That's only fair. I'll just

01:06.567 --> 01:09.778
use my portion for the video.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.530
That's the way

01:09.862 --> 01:11.530
I want to do it.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.114
Bubs...

01:13.198 --> 01:15.242
Ricky and I have

01:13.198 --> 01:15.242
been talking, man,

01:15.325 --> 01:17.619
and we decided that whatever

01:15.325 --> 01:17.619
money we make today,

01:17.703 --> 01:19.830
it's all going towards

01:17.703 --> 01:19.830
your video, buddy.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.164
(Chuckling)

01:19.914 --> 01:21.164
Every cent

01:19.914 --> 01:21.164
of it.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.583
What?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.583
Yeah, man!

01:22.666 --> 01:24.960
You just pay us back

01:22.666 --> 01:24.960
when you're rich.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.086
That's awesome, boys.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.756
That's awesome.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.756
Thank you.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.592
You guys are the

01:28.839 --> 01:31.592
best friends a fella

01:28.839 --> 01:31.592
could ever have.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.844
(Chuckling)

01:31.675 --> 01:33.844
I love you guys.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.262
Love you too, man.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.262
Love you too, buddy.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.680
Let's kick some

01:35.345 --> 01:36.680
fucking ass today, boys.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.766
Yeah! Come on.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.392
Bubbles:

01:38.849 --> 01:40.392
Quick like a bunny, Ricky.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.278
Get the fuck off the phone,

01:48.650 --> 01:51.278
you fucking phone dummy!

01:54.322 --> 01:56.366
Hi there, you should have

01:54.322 --> 01:56.366
a reservation for Ricky,

01:54.322 --> 01:56.366
Julian, and Bubbles,

01:56.450 --> 01:58.285
and, yes, I know we

01:56.450 --> 01:58.285
were supposed to fucking

01:56.450 --> 01:58.285
check in yesterday.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.954
I don't want to hear it.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.954
I don't give a fuck.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.622
I don't even want

02:00.037 --> 02:01.622
the fucking room key.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.415
There's probably an envelope

02:01.705 --> 02:03.415
or package left here for us,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.375
I just want that and I'll

02:03.498 --> 02:05.375
get the fuck out of here.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.168
Don't make any funny comments

02:05.459 --> 02:07.168
about how dumb we are,

02:07.252 --> 02:08.963
or "Fuck, you were supposed

02:07.252 --> 02:08.963
to be here yesterday".

02:09.046 --> 02:10.631
Give me the fucking envelope

02:09.046 --> 02:10.631
and I'll get the fuck out.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.051
Thank you.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.138
All right, let's see what

02:16.011 --> 02:18.138
we're dealing with today, boys.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.431
Actually, Bubs,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.431
do you want to read that?

02:19.514 --> 02:21.475
Some bigger type

02:19.514 --> 02:21.475
of words there.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.768
What?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.437
Los Angeles, Ricky.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.022
Okay.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.022
Los Angeles.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.607
"Task number one.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.943
"Out-smoke Anthony Stoner

02:31.026 --> 02:34.529
"in a seven round smoke-off

02:31.026 --> 02:34.529
at the Marijuana Mansion.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.781
A thousand bucks."

02:35.864 --> 02:37.908
Oh my... Done!

02:35.864 --> 02:37.908
Fucking done!

02:37.992 --> 02:39.493
That's the easiest

02:37.992 --> 02:39.493
thousand bucks

02:37.992 --> 02:39.493
we'll ever make.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.495
Fuck, man!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.495
And I can get high?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.122
(Chuckles)

02:41.578 --> 02:43.122
Just wait, though.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.248
Who's Anthony Stoner?

02:43.204 --> 02:45.248
I know that fucking name.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.959
Does it really matter

02:45.332 --> 02:46.959
who it is?

02:47.042 --> 02:49.795
Bubs, he can

02:47.042 --> 02:49.795
out-smoke anybody.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.795
That's fucking easy.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.630
Okay. Number two,

02:51.713 --> 02:53.214
"go to the

02:51.713 --> 02:53.214
following address

02:53.298 --> 02:56.384

02:56.468 --> 02:59.638

02:56.468 --> 02:59.638
Okay.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.057
Score one basket

02:59.721 --> 03:02.057
for a thousand bucks."

03:02.141 --> 03:03.934
Here comes the bullshit again.

03:04.018 --> 03:07.186
Yeah but, Julian,

03:04.018 --> 03:07.186
it doesn't matter

03:04.018 --> 03:07.186
who that is.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.981
I mean, obviously

03:07.270 --> 03:08.981
it's going to be somebody

03:09.064 --> 03:10.315
that's good at

03:09.064 --> 03:10.315
basketball but,

03:10.398 --> 03:12.151
even if it's Wilt

03:10.398 --> 03:12.151
The Stilt Chamberlain,

03:12.233 --> 03:14.028
we should be able

03:12.233 --> 03:14.028
to get one basket.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.279
You know what?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.279
Fuck playing

03:14.111 --> 03:16.279
basketball

03:14.111 --> 03:16.279
right now.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.614
I need to get high

03:16.363 --> 03:17.614
as fuck anyway.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.033
Take me to this

03:17.698 --> 03:19.033
Marijuana Mansion place,

03:19.116 --> 03:20.993
let me out-smoke

03:19.116 --> 03:20.993
this Anthony dick.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.495
I guarantee you

03:21.076 --> 03:23.495
we walk out of there

03:21.076 --> 03:23.495
with a thousand bucks.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.748
All right. Driver,

03:23.578 --> 03:26.748
can you take us to the

03:23.578 --> 03:26.748
Marijuana Mansion?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.709
Please?

03:26.832 --> 03:28.709
Finally.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.044
Thank fuck!

03:30.127 --> 03:33.296
8426. This is it

03:30.127 --> 03:33.296
right here, boys.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.799
8426 Rich Dick Lane.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.799
Look at this fucking place.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.258
I'm going

03:35.883 --> 03:37.258
to destroy this guy.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
Rich people can't

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
fucking smoke dope!

03:38.593 --> 03:39.970
Ricky...

03:38.593 --> 03:39.970
What?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.304
You're being a little

03:40.054 --> 03:41.304
over-confident.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.890
The man's named

03:41.388 --> 03:42.890
Anthony Stoner.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.349
Why do you think

03:42.973 --> 03:44.349
they call him that?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.185
It's obviously for

03:44.432 --> 03:46.185
a fucking reason.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
Well they fucking

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
call me Ricky for

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
a reason, right?

03:48.311 --> 03:51.190
No one's going to out-

03:48.311 --> 03:51.190
smoke me. It's probably

03:48.311 --> 03:51.190
not even possible.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.858
All right, Anthony,

03:51.272 --> 03:52.858
are you here?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.860
Are you going to let me in

03:52.941 --> 03:54.860
or are you fucking a-scared?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.778
There's probably

03:54.943 --> 03:56.778
a ding-dong you've

03:54.943 --> 03:56.778
got to ring.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.031
Guess he's not

03:56.862 --> 03:59.031
a-scared, anyway.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.991
It's going to be the

03:59.114 --> 04:00.991
fucking easiest thousand

03:59.114 --> 04:00.991
bucks we've ever made, boys.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.617
Ricky...

04:01.075 --> 04:02.617
I fucking

04:01.075 --> 04:02.617
agree, Ricky.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.452
Don't... this...

04:02.701 --> 04:04.452
Would you give him

04:02.701 --> 04:04.452
some confidence?

04:04.536 --> 04:06.496
Look at this shit.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.496
Rich people are so fucked!

04:06.580 --> 04:07.831
Fuck off.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.583
Fuck off.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.086
Fuck off.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.086
Why are you pissed

04:09.666 --> 04:12.086
off at the house?

04:12.169 --> 04:14.796
I just hate

04:12.169 --> 04:14.796
rich fucking shit.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.049
Julian:

04:14.880 --> 04:17.049
Hell, this place is

04:14.880 --> 04:17.049
nice, man, though.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.383
Bubbles:

04:17.132 --> 04:18.383
I'm telling you, boys, just...

04:18.466 --> 04:20.052
I like it, man.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.052
I love it too.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
Yeah.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
Let's do

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
business.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.138
Let's do some business

04:21.803 --> 04:23.138
together, okay?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.138
All right.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.848
Okay, man,

04:23.222 --> 04:24.848
take care.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.848
See you later.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.060
Hey, welcome to Big Mike's

04:24.932 --> 04:28.060
Marijuana Mansion.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.063
We're looking for

04:29.061 --> 04:31.063
Anthony Stoner?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.063
Anthony...

04:31.146 --> 04:33.857
That's me.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.857
Nice to meet you.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.857
How you doing?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.859
I knew

04:33.941 --> 04:35.859
I fucking heard

04:33.941 --> 04:35.859
that name before.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.611
Tommy Chong.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.029
(Whispering)

04:37.694 --> 04:39.029
That was his name

04:37.694 --> 04:39.029
in "Up In Smoke".

04:39.113 --> 04:40.405
Come on in, let's get

04:39.113 --> 04:40.405
this party started.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.865
Everything I said...

04:40.488 --> 04:41.865
we're fucked.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.700
We're not fucked.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.700
You've got this, Ricky.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.244
He doesn't got this.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.244
He's got this!

04:45.326 --> 04:47.079
I can't fucking out-smoke

04:45.326 --> 04:47.079
Tommy fucking Chong!

04:47.162 --> 04:48.705
What are you

04:47.162 --> 04:48.705
talking about?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.498
You are the

04:48.789 --> 04:50.498
fucking man.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.498
You got this, man.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.543
His lungs are way

04:50.582 --> 04:53.543
fucking bigger

04:50.582 --> 04:53.543
than<i> his</i> lungs, okay?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.462
It doesn't matter.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.462
It does matter!

04:55.545 --> 04:57.923
Oh my God.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.301
Bubbles:

04:58.006 --> 05:01.301
It's like going to

04:58.006 --> 05:01.301
play fucking hockey

04:58.006 --> 05:01.301
against Wayne Gretzky.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
Okay, you know

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
the rules, right?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.638
I think so, yeah.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.766
Okay, why don't

05:04.721 --> 05:07.766
you tell them to me,

05:04.721 --> 05:07.766
because I forgot.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.144
Oh, uh, well I think

05:07.849 --> 05:10.144
it's like, seven rounds.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.020
I didn't know it was going

05:10.227 --> 05:12.020
to be this fucking fancy,

05:12.104 --> 05:14.314
this is awesome,

05:12.104 --> 05:14.314
but I guess we, what? We

05:12.104 --> 05:14.314
pick a case, and then...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.399
Yeah, it says here,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.399
Ricky, you pick a case

05:16.483 --> 05:18.902
and then it'll tell

05:16.483 --> 05:18.902
you what you need

05:16.483 --> 05:18.902
to do to smoke it.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
All right.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.947
But before we

05:20.403 --> 05:21.947
start, let's...

05:22.030 --> 05:24.074
let's just start

05:22.030 --> 05:24.074
with the joints, okay?

05:24.158 --> 05:25.867
Because I got to get

05:24.158 --> 05:25.867
warmed up a little bit.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.411
Bubbles:

05:25.951 --> 05:28.411
He's smoking a fucking

05:25.951 --> 05:28.411
warm-up joint!

05:28.495 --> 05:30.580
(Inhaling)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
Bubbles:

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
Jesus Murphy.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.710
(Continues inhaling)

05:35.794 --> 05:37.545
Did you see that?

05:39.256 --> 05:42.050
He smoked a whole

05:39.256 --> 05:42.050
fucking joint

05:39.256 --> 05:42.050
in one breath.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.885
Okay, that's pretty

05:42.134 --> 05:43.885
fucked up.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.470
Okay, so pick

05:43.969 --> 05:45.470
your case.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.683
Let's start right here.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.683
Hm.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.393
(Clicking of latches)

05:53.478 --> 05:55.272
All right.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.816
Joint. "You must

05:55.396 --> 05:57.816
smoke a whole joint

05:55.396 --> 05:57.816
in 30 seconds."

05:57.899 --> 05:59.484
All right, all right.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.484
Is that even possible?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
Julian:

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
That's easy, man.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
Let's go. Ready?

06:01.569 --> 06:03.071
Come on.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.071
Holy fuck.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.698
Bubbles:

06:03.155 --> 06:04.698
Oh, God, Ricky.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.698
30 seconds.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.116
Worth a try, I guess.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.116
Ready? Go!

06:04.781 --> 06:06.116
Let's go.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.909
(Lighter clicks)

06:07.993 --> 06:09.328
Bubbles:

06:07.993 --> 06:09.328
Going to have

06:07.993 --> 06:09.328
to chug it, Ricky.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.996
Go, Ricky. Chug, chug,

06:09.410 --> 06:10.996
chug, chug, chug.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.622
You got it, man.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.622
Come on.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.208
That's it. That's it.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.711
( â™ª )

06:17.794 --> 06:19.213
Julian:

06:17.794 --> 06:19.213
Let's go, man.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.716
Little bit left, buddy.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.716
Come on, let's do it!

06:22.799 --> 06:24.051
Bubbles:

06:22.799 --> 06:24.051
Tommy fucking

06:22.799 --> 06:24.051
destroyed it.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.302
Ricky's doing good,

06:24.134 --> 06:25.302
he's almost done.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.553
Come on, man.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.429
Chug it man,

06:26.636 --> 06:28.429
come on.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.681
(Groans)

06:31.850 --> 06:33.434
Done.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.434
All right.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.145
Round one complete.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.357
That was a tie.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.357
Okay, that was good.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.357
That was good.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.942
All right, round two.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.401
Want to pick a case, Bubs?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.279
Me? Um...

06:44.363 --> 06:46.281
Uh, let's go with

06:44.363 --> 06:46.281
that one right there.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.200
Ricky:

06:46.365 --> 06:48.200
All right.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.244
Bubbles:

06:48.283 --> 06:50.244
The big one. Come on.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.244
No whammies. No whammies.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.208
Vape pen. "You must do

06:53.538 --> 06:56.208
a hit from a vape pen."

06:56.291 --> 06:58.210
Okay.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.210
Julian:

06:56.291 --> 06:58.210
This is a fucking joke, Ricky.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.045
You got this one, man.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.214
Bubbles:

07:00.128 --> 07:02.214
Yeah, but this could be

07:00.128 --> 07:02.214
a nuclear fucking vape pen too.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.590
This is going to be

07:02.297 --> 07:03.590
fucking easy.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.008
Stoner:

07:03.673 --> 07:05.008
All right. You ready?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.010
(Deep breath)

07:07.094 --> 07:10.013
(Inhaling)

07:12.515 --> 07:14.309
No, you've got to

07:12.515 --> 07:14.309
hold it in, man.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.977
Hold it in?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.977
Yeah.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.312
Holy fuck!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.312
What is this?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.980
It's not... It's

07:17.396 --> 07:18.980
not a... toke.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.440
You've got to do it

07:19.064 --> 07:20.440
again, but you've got

07:20.523 --> 07:21.900
to hold it in

07:20.523 --> 07:21.900
this time.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.900
(Coughing)

07:22.525 --> 07:24.694
I mean, once you...

07:22.525 --> 07:24.694
Hold on, I'll put

07:22.525 --> 07:24.694
the timer on.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.448
Go. Thirty seconds.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.448
Hold it. Hold it.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
Bubbles:

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
There's no timer...

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
30 seconds.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.120
Julian:

07:30.533 --> 07:33.120
Tommy, it says nothing

07:30.533 --> 07:33.120
about a timer.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.205
He knows Ricky's

07:33.203 --> 07:35.205
baked and he's

07:33.203 --> 07:35.205
fucking with his mind.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.582
Bubbles:

07:35.289 --> 07:37.582
Ricky's very good at this stuff,

07:37.665 --> 07:39.918
but Tommy Chong, he's a pro.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.046
He can... he can handle it

07:40.001 --> 07:43.046
and as soon as he knew this...

07:43.130 --> 07:45.090
that Ricky was getting

07:43.130 --> 07:45.090
a little too high,

07:45.173 --> 07:47.217
he just took control

07:45.173 --> 07:47.217
of his mind.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.594
Started bending the rules.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.512
I'm all right.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.512
Julian:

07:49.677 --> 07:51.512
Good, man, good.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.098
Round four, is it?

07:51.596 --> 07:53.098
Or five?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.599
Ricky, it's

07:53.181 --> 07:54.599
round three.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.059
Three?

07:56.143 --> 07:58.019
He's fucked,

07:56.143 --> 07:58.019
Julian.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.019
He's okay, man.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.521
Do you want to pick a case

07:58.103 --> 08:00.521
for round three, Anthony?

08:01.522 --> 08:02.816
Yeah, let's pick

08:01.522 --> 08:02.816
this one.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.692
Okay.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.527
Holy fuck, boys.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.779
This stuff is nuclear.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.032
Please be an easy one.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.327
Oh, water bong. Right on!

08:11.116 --> 08:13.327
Nice, nice.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.536
"Must smoke a weed load

08:13.410 --> 08:15.536
from a water bong."

08:17.122 --> 08:19.624
Okay. This looks

08:17.122 --> 08:19.624
like a water bong.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.835
Who's going first?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.086
You know what...

08:25.046 --> 08:26.256
Of course,

08:25.046 --> 08:26.256
you're going to go.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.216
Fuck.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.216
Listen.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.011
That's special Chong's

08:28.300 --> 08:31.011
choice weed in there.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.138
Great.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.138
So be careful.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.806
Bubbles:

08:33.221 --> 08:34.806
Julian, throw in

08:33.221 --> 08:34.806
the fucking towel.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.308
I'm not going to throw

08:34.889 --> 08:36.308
the fucking towel.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.767
Stoner:

08:36.391 --> 08:37.767
There you go.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.560
Hold it, hold it,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.560
hold it, come on, man.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.062
Julian:

08:39.644 --> 08:41.062
That's easy, man. That was easy.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.440
You're wasting

08:41.146 --> 08:43.440
a lot of it.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.440
(Exhaling)

08:43.523 --> 08:45.733
Suck it up.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.733
So I've got to do more?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.194
Yeah, you've got to do

08:45.817 --> 08:47.194
the whole bowl.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.237
(Bubbling)

08:47.277 --> 08:49.237
Bubbles:

08:47.277 --> 08:49.237
Oh my God, Julian...

08:49.321 --> 08:52.032
There's a lot

08:49.321 --> 08:52.032
in there, man.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.032
What?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.783
There's enough for

08:52.115 --> 08:53.783
a joint in there.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.286
(Lighter clicks)

08:53.867 --> 08:56.286
There you go.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.540
Here.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.540
You ju... you said

08:57.996 --> 09:00.540
one bowl, Tommy.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.958
What the fuck's

09:00.623 --> 09:01.958
going on here?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.293
Bubbles:

09:02.042 --> 09:03.293
Julian, he's trying to...

09:03.377 --> 09:04.627
Julian:

09:03.377 --> 09:04.627
I know what he's fucking doing.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.629
Stoner:

09:04.711 --> 09:06.629
That one's burned out.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.507
He needs a fresh one.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.884
This is easy, man.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.884
This is easy.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.222
You already...

09:13.470 --> 09:15.222
you already went?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.931
Yeah.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.931
A long time ago.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.225
Holy fuck.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.476
Bubbles:

09:18.308 --> 09:19.476
He didn't. He didn't.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.561
In fact, you've

09:19.559 --> 09:21.561
got to go again.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.938
Do you know that?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.938
I forgot to put

09:21.644 --> 09:23.938
the timer on.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.857
Julian:

09:24.022 --> 09:25.857
Fucking... The timer again.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.984
Bubbles:

09:25.940 --> 09:27.984
Oh my God, Julian.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.984
Throw in the fucking towel!

09:28.068 --> 09:29.944
There's no way to

09:28.068 --> 09:29.944
win this competition.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.405
There you go.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.405
Oh, nice hit.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.365
That's it,

09:31.488 --> 09:33.365
that was a good one.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.949
Now that's a good hit.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
Here, give me

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
a little shot

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
of that one.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.328
There we go.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.205
Bubbles:

09:38.412 --> 09:40.205
This isn't just a smoking

09:38.412 --> 09:40.205
competition, Julian.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
He's outsmarting

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
him. Tommy's like

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
a fucking weed Jedi.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.625
Ricky:

09:43.208 --> 09:44.625
We're good here.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.877
Julian:

09:44.709 --> 09:45.877
One down. Okay.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.877
There's another one.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.879
Let's get another

09:45.960 --> 09:47.879
briefcase going.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.591
This whole competition got

09:47.962 --> 09:51.591
out of hand so quickly.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.051
It was ridiculous.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.969
I mean, the things

09:53.134 --> 09:54.969
they had him doing.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.138
Ricky had to smoke a joint,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.474
then chug a joint,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.474
then smoke three joints...

10:00.559 --> 10:02.143
Vape pen up the nose...

10:04.229 --> 10:07.482
(Lighter clicking)

10:04.229 --> 10:07.482
Smoking a big bud.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.482
By itself...

10:07.566 --> 10:08.816
(Exhaling)

10:08.900 --> 10:11.319
Dabs and bongs

10:08.900 --> 10:11.319
at the same time...

10:11.403 --> 10:13.696
It's fucking... you name it.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.490
Bubbles:

10:13.780 --> 10:15.490
Come on, Julian.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.490
He's going to damage

10:15.574 --> 10:17.658
what's left of

10:15.574 --> 10:17.658
his fucking brain.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.658
Let's just quit.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.035
I don't know what Bubbles

10:17.742 --> 10:19.035
is going on about.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.287
He was acting

10:19.119 --> 10:20.287
like he's never been

10:20.370 --> 10:21.746
around Ricky

10:20.370 --> 10:21.746
getting high before.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.331
As long as Ricky's breathing,

10:23.415 --> 10:25.125
Ricky can still

10:23.415 --> 10:25.125
keep getting higher.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.376
(Exhaling)

10:29.003 --> 10:30.838
Good. You're

10:29.003 --> 10:30.838
good, man.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.007
Bubbles:

10:30.922 --> 10:33.007
He's not good!

10:30.922 --> 10:33.007
He's almost in a coma.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.551
Leave him alone.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.551
He's fine.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.471
You're up.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.347
Bubbles:

10:37.554 --> 10:39.347
Julian, there's no way

10:37.554 --> 10:39.347
we're going to win this.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.182
Why are you

10:39.431 --> 10:41.182
doing this?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.351
Just hang in

10:41.266 --> 10:43.351
there, Bubs. He's

10:41.266 --> 10:43.351
almost done, man.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.852
Bubbles:

10:43.435 --> 10:44.852
He can't win.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.980
Tommy smoked

10:44.936 --> 10:46.980
as much as he has,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.982
and he doesn't even

10:47.063 --> 10:48.982
look like he's high,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.982
for fuck's sakes!

10:49.065 --> 10:51.234
Yeah...

10:51.318 --> 10:52.986
This dab shit.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.362
Julian:

10:53.069 --> 10:54.362
Okay, that's another one.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.947
Let's get another

10:54.446 --> 10:55.947
briefcase going.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.825
Bubbles:

10:57.031 --> 10:58.825
Oh, he's going down.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.825
He's going down.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.827
Julian:

10:58.908 --> 11:00.827
Rick, Rick. What

10:58.908 --> 11:00.827
are you doing, man?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.288
Bubbles:

11:00.910 --> 11:03.288
He's going for a nap.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.288
I'm fine, I'm fine, boys.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.373
I'm fine.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.373
Bubbles:

11:03.371 --> 11:05.373
He's going for a nap.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.750
Ricky:

11:05.457 --> 11:07.750
Just put it... Get the hose

11:05.457 --> 11:07.750
and put it in my mouth, Bubs.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.461
Julian:

11:07.834 --> 11:09.461
You got a hose or

11:07.834 --> 11:09.461
something, Tommy?

11:09.544 --> 11:11.045
Ricky:

11:09.544 --> 11:11.045
That dab machine hose.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.424
Dab machine hose?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.424
What the fuck?

11:14.508 --> 11:16.468
Julian,

11:14.508 --> 11:16.468
look at him.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.012
(Coughing)

11:19.095 --> 11:20.930
Julian:

11:19.095 --> 11:20.930
Rick, you've got to...

11:19.095 --> 11:20.930
Come on. Get up.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.557
Ricky: I'm good.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.557
Come on, man.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.557
You're up.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.767
I'm awesome, guys.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.767
It's your turn.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.145
All right. Bubs,

11:24.851 --> 11:27.145
just bring it over

11:27.228 --> 11:28.480
and get it in my mouth.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.023
No. You know

11:28.563 --> 11:30.023
what, Julian?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.816
Fuck this.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.816
I'm throwing in

11:30.106 --> 11:31.816
the towel.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.276
The towel's in.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.276
Let's go, Ricky.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.528
What do you mean

11:33.360 --> 11:34.528
the towel's in, bud?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.488
The towel is in.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.488
We're leaving.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.658
It's almost over, man!

11:36.571 --> 11:39.658
Let's go, Ricky.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.658
I'm 100%.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.660
He's saying he's

11:39.740 --> 11:41.660
a hundred percent.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.161
He doesn't even know

11:41.742 --> 11:43.161
what he's saying.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.412
Come on.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.412
Get up, buddy.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.830
Get up, Ricky.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.830
Get up, get up.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.874
His legs don't

11:45.913 --> 11:47.874
even work.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.874
Did I win?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.168
No, you didn't

11:47.957 --> 11:50.168
fucking win.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.168
We're about to win.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.710
No, he's done.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.630
I'm fine, guys.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.630
Ricky, you're not fine.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.131
Look at your rubber legs.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.884
Look, he's doing the

11:55.215 --> 11:57.884
funky chicken. Come on.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.470
Thanks, Tommy.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.470
Good try, buddy!

12:00.554 --> 12:02.430
See you, Tom.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.430
For fuck's sakes!

12:02.514 --> 12:05.183
Let's go, Ricky.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.183
Going in reverse,

12:02.514 --> 12:05.183
are you?

12:05.266 --> 12:06.809
Just... just one

12:05.266 --> 12:06.809
more round.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.229
I tried to tell Julian

12:06.893 --> 12:09.229
that Ricky was at his limit,

12:09.312 --> 12:10.522
but Julian doesn't listen.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.482
All Julian gives

12:10.605 --> 12:12.482
a fuck about is money.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.150
And the next thing you know,

12:14.234 --> 12:17.070
just like I predicted,

12:14.234 --> 12:17.070
fucking explosion time.

12:18.737 --> 12:20.615
Bubbles:

12:18.737 --> 12:20.615
Ricky! Jesus Murphy!

12:20.699 --> 12:22.659
He exploded, Julian.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.659
Oh my fuck.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.411
Ricky, are you

12:22.741 --> 12:24.411
all right?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.995
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.995
It must be from

12:24.494 --> 12:25.995
what I ate.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.247
It's not from

12:26.079 --> 12:27.247
the fucking dope.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.623
No, we ate

12:27.330 --> 12:28.623
the same thing.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.041
We're not fucking sick.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.041
Fuck off.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.459
Fuck off.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.169
Okay, what the fuck

12:31.543 --> 12:33.169
are we going to do now?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.004
What do you mean, what

12:33.253 --> 12:35.004
are we going to do now?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.548
Yeah, what the fuck

12:35.088 --> 12:36.548
are we going to do now?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.049
We're going to

12:36.631 --> 12:38.049
play basketball

12:38.132 --> 12:39.967
to make a thousand

12:38.132 --> 12:39.967
bucks for the video.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.967
With him?

12:40.051 --> 12:42.011
Bubs, I'm way too

12:40.051 --> 12:42.011
fucking high to

12:40.051 --> 12:42.011
play basketball.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.513
You don't understand.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.513
You'll have to get

12:42.095 --> 12:43.513
somebody else

12:43.597 --> 12:44.931
or we're not

12:43.597 --> 12:44.931
fucking doing it.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.765
Ricky,

12:45.014 --> 12:46.765
you have to do it.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.018
Me and him will do

12:46.849 --> 12:49.018
most of the work

12:46.849 --> 12:49.018
but you can do it.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.687
Come on.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.687
You even...

12:50.769 --> 12:52.939
Sebastian:

12:50.769 --> 12:52.939
What in the fuck is going on?

12:53.022 --> 12:54.773
You've got to be shitting me!

12:54.857 --> 12:56.484
Ricky:

12:54.857 --> 12:56.484
Baz! What the fuck?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.484
Are you serious?

12:56.568 --> 12:58.819
Bubbles:

12:56.568 --> 12:58.819
Sebastian Bach?

12:56.568 --> 12:58.819
How does this keep happening?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.238
Like, really?

13:00.321 --> 13:02.073
First it was Amsterdam,

13:02.156 --> 13:04.909
now it's beautiful

13:02.156 --> 13:04.909
Los Angeles!

13:02.156 --> 13:04.909
What's up, man?

13:04.992 --> 13:08.162
I saw this film

13:04.992 --> 13:08.162
equipment being utilized

13:08.246 --> 13:10.123
and I knew it

13:08.246 --> 13:10.123
would probably be

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
you three fine

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
individuals.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.501
Hey! What's

13:11.999 --> 13:13.501
going on?

13:13.585 --> 13:15.462
How are you doing?

13:13.585 --> 13:15.462
Check this

13:13.585 --> 13:15.462
fucking guy out.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.589
Are you puking?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.589
Ricky!

13:17.672 --> 13:19.758
Fuck!

13:17.672 --> 13:19.758
Jesus! That

13:17.672 --> 13:19.758
is killer.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.469
Dude, you guys have

13:19.840 --> 13:22.469
got to come to my

13:19.840 --> 13:22.469
house right now.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.804
I got some weed

13:22.552 --> 13:25.804
that'll make your

13:22.552 --> 13:25.804
tummy feel better.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.804
Yes.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
No!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
Let's fucking

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
do it.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.601
You need it.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.601
Ricky!

13:27.181 --> 13:29.601
No, no, hey!

13:29.684 --> 13:31.352
Bubs, come on.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.352
We can't go

13:29.684 --> 13:31.352
right now.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.771
It'll make him

13:31.436 --> 13:32.771
feel better.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.939
You've got to come to

13:32.853 --> 13:34.939
my house right now.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.441
We can't. We've got...

13:35.022 --> 13:36.441
Come on, Bubs. Please.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.985
Ricky, don't touch me

13:36.524 --> 13:38.985
with your puke hands.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.695
We got a thing

13:39.068 --> 13:40.695
we're doing.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.155
We've got to go

13:40.779 --> 13:42.155
play basketball

13:42.238 --> 13:43.531
'cause we can make

13:42.238 --> 13:43.531
a thousand bucks.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.325
Excuse me?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.325
Get him to

13:43.615 --> 13:45.325
play with you.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.034
He's perfect.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.034
Listen.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.412
I'm not tall enough

13:47.118 --> 13:49.412
to play basketball,

13:47.118 --> 13:49.412
for one thing.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.706
And fuck sports,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.706
by the way.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.501
Since when are you

13:51.790 --> 13:54.501
guys into sports?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.085
Other than puking?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.085
No, we're not.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.254
We're not, but

13:56.169 --> 13:58.254
we can make money.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.674
Look boys, we're not doing

13:58.338 --> 14:00.674
this right now. It's...

14:00.757 --> 14:02.883
Come on.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.883
It sounds awesome.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.011
Did you say

14:02.967 --> 14:05.011
"make money"?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.721
We have to make

14:05.094 --> 14:06.721
a thousand bucks

14:06.805 --> 14:09.015
'cause I'm trying

14:06.805 --> 14:09.015
to make a music video.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.392
You know what it's

14:09.098 --> 14:11.392
like, music videos...

14:11.476 --> 14:13.102
Yeah, I do know

14:11.476 --> 14:13.102
what it's like.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.771
And I never made

14:13.186 --> 14:14.771
a fucking video

14:14.853 --> 14:17.440
by making money

14:14.853 --> 14:17.440
from basketball!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.484
What the fuck?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.484
Fuck that!

14:19.567 --> 14:20.860
Come to my house!

14:20.943 --> 14:23.613
We can't. Not

14:20.943 --> 14:23.613
right now, boys.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.613
Bubs...

14:23.697 --> 14:24.905
Maybe another time.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.283
Okay, well, listen.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.283
Tomorrow night,

14:27.367 --> 14:30.495
I am having a fucking shindig.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.747
It's going to be

14:30.578 --> 14:32.747
unbelievable.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.166
There's going to be chicks.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.459
There's going to be booze.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.711
There's going to

14:36.543 --> 14:37.711
be celebrities,

14:37.794 --> 14:39.962
but I'm talking

14:37.794 --> 14:39.962
about cool celebs.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.842
Not only will there

14:40.046 --> 14:43.842
be Gene Simmons,

14:43.924 --> 14:46.511
but guess who's

14:43.924 --> 14:46.511
been hanging out

14:43.924 --> 14:46.511
at my fucking house?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.262
I've been hanging out

14:48.346 --> 14:50.724
with fucking

14:48.346 --> 14:50.724
Richard Simmons.

14:51.098 --> 14:53.309
And you know what

14:51.098 --> 14:53.309
he's got at my house?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.353
Whole wheat blow.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.855
What?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.855
It's organic!

14:56.937 --> 14:59.232
That's the way we roll

14:56.937 --> 14:59.232
down here in L.A.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.526
Whole wheat blow?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.526
Everything

14:59.315 --> 15:01.526
is organic,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.696
including the blow.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.696
Well, we can't.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.740
We're flying

15:04.779 --> 15:06.740
out tonight.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.740
We can't go.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.282
There's chicks going

15:06.823 --> 15:08.282
to be at this party?

15:08.366 --> 15:10.326
Yeah, there's chicks

15:08.366 --> 15:10.326
<i>and</i> Richard Simmons.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.703
I'm going to go...

15:10.410 --> 15:11.703
I don't care

15:10.410 --> 15:11.703
about it.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.953
The chicks... there

15:11.786 --> 15:12.953
are chicks there.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.082
We're flying out

15:13.037 --> 15:16.082
tonight, Julian.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.082
Bubs!

15:16.165 --> 15:17.751
Sebastian:

15:16.165 --> 15:17.751
Okay, you know what,

15:16.165 --> 15:17.751
I can't convince

15:17.834 --> 15:20.294
a bunch of fucking goofs

15:17.834 --> 15:20.294
to not be goofs.

15:20.378 --> 15:24.048
So you guys go do fucking

15:20.378 --> 15:24.048
basketball videos

15:24.131 --> 15:25.592
or whatever the

15:24.131 --> 15:25.592
hell that is.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.636
I'm going to go party

15:25.675 --> 15:28.636
with Richard Simmons

15:28.720 --> 15:31.264
and get a blow job

15:28.720 --> 15:31.264
in my car.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.515
Later.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.227
Come on, boys.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.227
Fuck's sakes, Bubs...

15:36.310 --> 15:38.938
Well, we can't

15:36.310 --> 15:38.938
go right now!

15:39.021 --> 15:41.357
It's... you promised me.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.357
Okay, let's get

15:39.021 --> 15:41.357
this over with.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.817
So the coolest guy ever

15:41.441 --> 15:42.817
shows up

15:42.901 --> 15:44.694
and it's, "Oh, fuck

15:42.901 --> 15:44.694
Bubbles and his video!"

15:44.778 --> 15:46.404
All right, okay...

15:44.778 --> 15:46.404
Are you all done, Rick?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.197
Are you finished?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.197
(Heaving)

15:48.281 --> 15:49.532
Okay, let's

15:48.281 --> 15:49.532
get in the...

15:49.616 --> 15:52.452
For fuck's sakes.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.452
(Groaning)

15:52.535 --> 15:55.371
Bubbles:

15:52.535 --> 15:55.371
Ricky, Jesus.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.371
Okay. Get it out.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.498
Let's get in the van.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.498
(Panting)

15:57.582 --> 15:59.250
You better fucking

15:57.582 --> 15:59.250
appreciate this, Bubs.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.752
This is lame!

15:59.333 --> 16:00.752
I do appreciate it!

16:00.835 --> 16:02.295
Oh, fuck, boys,

16:00.835 --> 16:02.295
I can't believe

16:02.378 --> 16:03.755
I'm still fucking

16:02.378 --> 16:03.755
this high.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.632
It's awesome,

16:03.838 --> 16:05.632
but it's too much.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.592
Ricky, you've got little

16:05.715 --> 16:07.592
danglers hanging off

16:05.715 --> 16:07.592
your chin there.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.135
You get the fuck back!

16:10.637 --> 16:13.598
You're not using me

16:10.637 --> 16:13.598
as a napkin.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.308
Julian:

16:13.681 --> 16:15.308
Fucking Jesus.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.518
Don't look at me like

16:15.391 --> 16:17.518
I'm a napkin, Ricky.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.313
A serviette.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.315
If anything,

16:20.396 --> 16:22.315
I'm a serviette.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.322
Look at how

16:26.694 --> 16:29.322
fucked he is.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.658
Ricky, we need you

16:29.405 --> 16:31.658
in this game,

16:31.741 --> 16:34.076
but I guess you can

16:31.741 --> 16:34.076
just stand still

16:34.160 --> 16:35.995
and we'll use you

16:34.160 --> 16:35.995
for passes and...

16:36.078 --> 16:38.498
I believe they call them

16:36.078 --> 16:38.498
"give and go's".

16:38.581 --> 16:41.417
I can't promise much.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.377
Bubs, none of us know

16:41.501 --> 16:43.377
how to play basketball.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.463
This is...

16:43.461 --> 16:45.463
I do.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.463
I'm quite good.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.006
It's going to be

16:45.546 --> 16:47.006
a waste of time.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.883
We're not going to

16:47.089 --> 16:48.883
fucking win any money.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.302
Well, not with

16:48.967 --> 16:51.302
that attitude.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.302
(Sigh)

16:51.385 --> 16:53.554
What if I told you

16:51.385 --> 16:53.554
there was a way we

16:51.385 --> 16:53.554
can shoot this video

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
without having to play

16:53.638 --> 16:55.890
fucking basketball?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.475
Huh?

16:55.974 --> 16:57.475
What does that mean?

16:57.558 --> 16:58.852
I don't know, man.

17:00.227 --> 17:02.062
I picked up another

17:00.227 --> 17:02.062
one of these.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.607
Oh, my fuck.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.607
Ricky:

17:02.146 --> 17:04.607
(Giggling)

17:04.691 --> 17:06.734
Is that Tommy Chong's

17:04.691 --> 17:06.734
credit card?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.528
Bubs, he's got lots

17:06.818 --> 17:08.528
of fucking money, okay?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.155
He's not going to

17:08.611 --> 17:11.155
notice a few little

17:08.611 --> 17:11.155
transactions on it.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.616
Oh, yeah?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.616
You're the fucking

17:11.238 --> 17:13.616
man, Julian!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.618
This is perfect!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.618
Bubbles:

17:13.700 --> 17:15.618
Unbelievable.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.119
Un-fucking-believable.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.621
That's fucking...

17:17.203 --> 17:18.621
We can change

17:17.203 --> 17:18.621
our flights,

17:18.705 --> 17:20.915
shoot a wicked video.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.915
Fuck, boys, this is...

17:20.999 --> 17:22.458
Bubbles:

17:20.999 --> 17:22.458
No.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.458
Oh, yes.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.627
Bubbles, we can rent

17:22.542 --> 17:24.627
a bunch of fucking

17:22.542 --> 17:24.627
hot models.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.338
Prostitutes?

17:24.711 --> 17:27.338
No, models. It's L.A.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.798
We'll pay for the

17:27.421 --> 17:28.798
fucking car this time

17:28.882 --> 17:30.174
and get food,

17:28.882 --> 17:30.174
like noodles

17:30.257 --> 17:32.468
and fucking

17:30.257 --> 17:32.468
foods of...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.387
Bubs, this video

17:32.552 --> 17:34.387
needs ladies.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.472
That's what this

17:34.470 --> 17:36.472
video fucking needs.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.307
Boys, we're not

17:36.556 --> 17:38.307
doing this.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.726
I'm telling you

17:38.391 --> 17:39.726
right now.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.686
We're going to play

17:39.809 --> 17:41.686
in this basketball game

17:41.769 --> 17:44.271
and we're going to win.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.271
Legitimately.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.940
That's the fucking deal.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.274
I'm not getting

17:46.024 --> 17:47.274
involved

17:47.358 --> 17:50.028
with more federal

17:47.358 --> 17:50.028
credit card fraud.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.280
I feel bad enough using

17:50.110 --> 17:53.280
Alex Lifeson's card.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.741
We're going

17:53.364 --> 17:54.741
to win this game

17:54.824 --> 17:57.076
or we're going the

17:54.824 --> 17:57.076
fuck home right now,

17:57.159 --> 17:58.828
and we'll just call

17:57.159 --> 17:58.828
this a waste of time

17:58.912 --> 18:00.914
and I'll figure out a way

17:58.912 --> 18:00.914
to make my video legit.

18:02.331 --> 18:06.044
(Sigh)

18:02.331 --> 18:06.044
You stole his

18:02.331 --> 18:06.044
fucking credit card!

18:06.126 --> 18:07.461
Tommy Chong!

18:07.545 --> 18:10.006
Bubs, it's not

18:07.545 --> 18:10.006
a big fucking deal.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.507
No! Fuck, no!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.509
Tommy Chong's going to be

18:11.591 --> 18:13.509
through his statement.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.720
"Oh, when did I get

18:13.593 --> 18:15.720
five prostitutes?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.722
I don't remember that."

18:15.803 --> 18:17.722
Models!

18:20.725 --> 18:22.268
Ricky, what are

18:20.725 --> 18:22.268
you doing?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.062
The doors are

18:22.351 --> 18:24.062
already open.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.312
He's fucked.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.564
This place is big.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.564
Holy fuck,

18:26.647 --> 18:28.066
look at the size

18:26.647 --> 18:28.066
of this place!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.400
Julian:

18:28.148 --> 18:29.400
All right, so who

18:28.148 --> 18:29.400
are we looking for?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.527
Banana pants.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.527
That must be him

18:29.483 --> 18:31.527
right there.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.988
There's, like, 50

18:31.611 --> 18:33.988
courts in this place.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.490
Guys, yellow pants?

18:34.072 --> 18:36.490
This guy?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.743
Ricky: (Singsong)

18:36.574 --> 18:38.743
Banana pants.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.743
Banana pants...

18:38.826 --> 18:40.411
Julian:

18:38.826 --> 18:40.411
Boys, boys, boys,

18:38.826 --> 18:40.411
this is...

18:40.494 --> 18:42.204
(Singsong)

18:40.494 --> 18:42.204
Banana pants.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.204
Listen, Ricky, Ricky...

18:42.288 --> 18:44.958
Do you know

18:42.288 --> 18:44.958
who that is?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.958
It's Dennis Rodman.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.584
Dennis fucking Rodman.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.877
Oh, my fuck.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.378
See, there

18:47.961 --> 18:49.378
they go again.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.630
We can't play fucking...

18:50.713 --> 18:52.799
three-on-one against him.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.425
What are we doing?

18:52.882 --> 18:54.425
Let's just...

18:54.508 --> 18:56.343
let's just

18:54.508 --> 18:56.343
fucking do it.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.343
We need one basket.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.638
I'm fucking baked!

18:58.721 --> 19:00.598
Hey, man,

18:58.721 --> 19:00.598
how's it going?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.598
What's up, brother?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.391
I guess we're supposed

19:00.681 --> 19:02.391
to be playing basketball

19:02.475 --> 19:04.268
with you or something?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.268
Oh, my God, that's

19:02.475 --> 19:04.268
Dennis Rodman.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.853
Hey, man,

19:04.351 --> 19:05.853
how's it going?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.313
Dennis Rodman,

19:05.937 --> 19:07.313
how you doing?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.773
Doing well, brother,

19:07.396 --> 19:08.773
doing well.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
We're supposed to,

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
um... play a game

19:11.317 --> 19:12.568
of three-on-one

19:11.317 --> 19:12.568
against you, apparently.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.820
But I don't know now,

19:13.903 --> 19:15.071
I'm starting

19:13.903 --> 19:15.071
to second-guess

19:15.154 --> 19:16.906
whether this is a

19:15.154 --> 19:16.906
good idea because...

19:16.990 --> 19:18.491
I mean, I'm good,

19:16.990 --> 19:18.491
boys, but I'm not...

19:18.574 --> 19:19.826
You are good,

19:18.574 --> 19:19.826
you can do this.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.577
Come on.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.577
I know, but,

19:19.909 --> 19:21.577
like...

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
There's

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
three of us,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
there's only

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
one of him, man.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.247
You're going to have

19:23.663 --> 19:25.247
to carry the team.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.917
That's right.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.917
All right,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.917
you ready for this?

19:28.001 --> 19:29.669
Yes, I guess.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.462
(Stammering)

19:29.752 --> 19:31.462
He's high.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
He's, uh, you know,

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
drinking, you know.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.549
So, I wish I was

19:33.339 --> 19:35.549
joining him.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.259
I don't do that,

19:35.633 --> 19:37.259
but I do that.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.845
I hear you. See?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.845
There you go,

19:37.343 --> 19:38.845
brother.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.096
This guy knows

19:38.928 --> 19:40.096
what it's all about.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.347
So I don't know

19:40.179 --> 19:41.347
what you do.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.807
I do both of

19:41.430 --> 19:42.807
those things,

19:42.890 --> 19:44.142
but I also...

19:42.890 --> 19:44.142
you know...

19:44.224 --> 19:45.392
You'd do both of us?

19:45.476 --> 19:46.853
(Laughing)

19:45.476 --> 19:46.853
What?

19:45.476 --> 19:46.853
No, I...

19:46.936 --> 19:48.104
No, Ricky, I...

19:48.187 --> 19:49.355
You want to

19:48.187 --> 19:49.355
do Dennis.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.690
Is that what

19:49.438 --> 19:50.690
you just said?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.650
What?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.650
I never said that!

19:52.733 --> 19:54.485
Julian:

19:52.733 --> 19:54.485
Obviously he's got

19:52.733 --> 19:54.485
a crush on you.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.485
There you go...

19:54.568 --> 19:56.362
You've got a crush...

19:54.568 --> 19:56.362
Stop telling

19:54.568 --> 19:56.362
Dennis Rodman

19:56.445 --> 19:58.197
I got a fucking

19:56.445 --> 19:58.197
crush on him!

19:58.280 --> 20:00.033
(Whispering)

19:58.280 --> 20:00.033
Okay, Ricky, get ready

19:58.280 --> 20:00.033
for the sneak pass.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.450
Dennis:

20:00.116 --> 20:01.450
Just got to

20:00.116 --> 20:01.450
make one, baby,

20:01.534 --> 20:03.285
got to make one.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.285
Okay. Can I take

20:01.534 --> 20:03.285
a practice shot?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.454
You can take

20:03.369 --> 20:05.454
a practice shot

20:03.369 --> 20:05.454
all you want.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.081
Let's see how good

20:05.538 --> 20:07.081
you are, Bubs,

20:07.165 --> 20:09.249
you've been

20:07.165 --> 20:09.249
fucking bragging.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.249
(Quick breaths)

20:09.333 --> 20:11.085
Dennis:

20:09.333 --> 20:11.085
(Laughing)

20:12.336 --> 20:13.504
You guys ready?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.089
I guess so.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.089
You guys ready?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.466
Yup, I've got to try

20:15.173 --> 20:17.466
to get around you.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.218
You got it, Bubs.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.218
Okay.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.095
I can get...

20:19.301 --> 20:21.095
(Panting)

20:21.179 --> 20:22.346
(Laughing)

20:24.431 --> 20:26.350
Julian:

20:24.431 --> 20:26.350
Bubs, you...

20:24.431 --> 20:26.350
(Laughter)

20:26.433 --> 20:27.894
That was terrible!

20:26.433 --> 20:27.894
Fuck's sakes!

20:27.977 --> 20:29.187
Here, Bubs.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.771
I used to watch

20:29.269 --> 20:30.771
the Globetrotters.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.523
All right.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.523
(Panting)

20:32.606 --> 20:33.816
Oh, fuck's sakes!

20:35.442 --> 20:37.236
Ricky & Julian:

20:35.442 --> 20:37.236
Ohhhhh...

20:35.442 --> 20:37.236
Dennis:

20:35.442 --> 20:37.236
There you go.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.821
See?

20:37.319 --> 20:38.821
I got it over him.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.821
Almost.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.781
I got it over

20:38.905 --> 20:40.781
him at least.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.366
Three on one,

20:40.865 --> 20:42.366
it's supposed

20:40.865 --> 20:42.366
to be you guys...

20:42.449 --> 20:44.077
Ricky:

20:42.449 --> 20:44.077
Okay, I'm ready.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.077
I'm ready.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.327
Let's get into it.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.746
All right.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.746
Ready?

20:46.829 --> 20:48.122
(Grunt)

20:46.829 --> 20:48.122
Sneak pass!

20:48.206 --> 20:50.083
(Laughing)

20:52.376 --> 20:53.502
(Quick panting)

20:55.046 --> 20:56.214
Fuck!

20:57.798 --> 20:58.966
Dennis:

20:57.798 --> 20:58.966
You can do better

20:57.798 --> 20:58.966
than that.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.384
Come on, Rick...

20:59.050 --> 21:00.384
Ricky,

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
you're too fucking

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
baked to do this.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.388
Here, you...

21:01.886 --> 21:04.388
Here, you do it.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.932
Another one, Bubs.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.932
A little lower,

21:06.015 --> 21:07.307
not as much fucking...

21:07.391 --> 21:08.893
Don't put

21:07.391 --> 21:08.893
as much muscle...

21:08.976 --> 21:10.811
Bubs, you were way

21:08.976 --> 21:10.811
to the left, man.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.730
All right, Julian.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.730
Fuck's sakes.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.356
All right, here.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.356
Here, take it, Rick.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.276
(Grunt, laughter)

21:17.359 --> 21:19.653
Nice pass, goofy.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.653
Too fucking tall!

21:19.737 --> 21:21.572
(Grunt)

21:19.737 --> 21:21.572
Fuck!

21:23.074 --> 21:25.576
Well, I'm fucking...

21:23.074 --> 21:25.576
least I'm trying.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.994
That's more than

21:25.659 --> 21:26.994
you're doing, Ricky.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.829
Here, I'll pass it

21:27.078 --> 21:28.829
to you, it'll help.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.458
Julian:

21:30.706 --> 21:32.458
You've got it, Bubs.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.085
You've got to deke

21:32.541 --> 21:34.085
around him or

21:32.541 --> 21:34.085
something, man!

21:35.711 --> 21:36.921
Bubbles:

21:35.711 --> 21:36.921
Aww, for fuck's sakes!

21:38.047 --> 21:40.299
(Frustrated groan)

21:38.047 --> 21:40.299
Not even close, man.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.302
Ricky:

21:41.675 --> 21:43.302
Oh, fuck, Bubbles!

21:44.971 --> 21:47.181
I don't know, man,

21:44.971 --> 21:47.181
we'll get...

21:44.971 --> 21:47.181
(Grunt)

21:47.265 --> 21:48.933
Bubbles:

21:47.265 --> 21:48.933
Fuck!

21:47.265 --> 21:48.933
Nice try, Bubs.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.602
Oh, that was...

21:49.016 --> 21:51.602
that's an old

21:49.016 --> 21:51.602
hockey move.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.187
A hockey move, huh?

21:53.271 --> 21:54.605
A Gretzky move, huh?

21:54.688 --> 21:56.023
Yes, Wayne Gretzky,

21:56.107 --> 21:57.900
best player

21:56.107 --> 21:57.900
in the NHL.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
Bubs...

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
All right, we've got

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
to figure something

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
out here, boys.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.782
Look, man, we...

22:03.405 --> 22:04.782
we need money.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.284
We have no

22:04.865 --> 22:06.284
money, right?

22:06.366 --> 22:08.744
And to get a basket...

22:06.366 --> 22:08.744
just let us get a basket.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.121
Okay.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.121
We'll split the

22:08.828 --> 22:10.121
money with you.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.831
We'll split it.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.831
It's five grand.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.707
All right.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.707
Okay, Bubs,

22:11.914 --> 22:13.707
you got it.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.417
All right, you

22:13.791 --> 22:15.417
probably only get

22:13.791 --> 22:15.417
one shot at this.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.796
Julian:

22:15.501 --> 22:18.796
You got this,

22:15.501 --> 22:18.796
man, come on.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.381
Show me in slow motion.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.381
Should be in slow motion.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.633
Simple science.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.052
Bubbles:

22:24.051 --> 22:25.052
Cocksucker!

22:25.136 --> 22:26.846
Dennis:

22:25.136 --> 22:26.846
Here you go.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.223
Can't do it.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.223
He can't be beat.

22:29.307 --> 22:32.018
I'm sorry, guys.

22:29.307 --> 22:32.018
(Indistinct) ...tries.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.978
Just keep practising

22:32.101 --> 22:33.978
man, keep practising.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.855
All right.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.855
One of these

22:34.061 --> 22:35.855
days, brother,

22:35.938 --> 22:37.898
I'll come to Canada

22:35.938 --> 22:37.898
and check you out.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.108
I'll come to Canada.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.818
All right?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.818
Bubbles:

22:39.192 --> 22:40.818
Thanks.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.902
Various:

22:40.901 --> 22:41.902
(Mixed thank yous)

22:40.901 --> 22:41.902
All right, brother.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.445
All right,

22:41.986 --> 22:43.445
brother.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.698
(Sigh)

22:47.033 --> 22:49.660
Nice.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.660
I get it in!

22:49.743 --> 22:51.287
It doesn't count now!

22:49.743 --> 22:51.287
Why couldn't you do that

22:51.369 --> 22:54.040
when fucking

22:51.369 --> 22:54.040
daff-der-dil pants

22:51.369 --> 22:54.040
was here?

22:54.123 --> 22:56.334
For fuck's sakes!

22:54.123 --> 22:56.334
See that?

22:56.416 --> 22:58.376
This task was

22:56.416 --> 22:58.376
fucking bullshit.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.129
One of the greatest

22:58.460 --> 23:00.129
basketball players

23:00.213 --> 23:01.964
of all time against us?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.799
With Ricky baked

23:02.048 --> 23:03.799
out of his fucking mind

23:03.883 --> 23:05.509
and Julian won't even

23:03.883 --> 23:05.509
set his drink down

23:05.592 --> 23:07.803
to... to give it a try?

23:07.887 --> 23:09.180
So I guess I just accept

23:09.263 --> 23:11.349
there's no money

23:09.263 --> 23:11.349
to make my video.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.142
Fucking assholes.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.145
All we had to do

23:13.226 --> 23:16.145
was make one shot!

23:17.479 --> 23:19.106
Well, one good thing is

23:19.190 --> 23:20.816
it looks like I'm finally

23:19.190 --> 23:20.816
crab-free, boys.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.193
So that's positive, right?

23:22.276 --> 23:23.986
Oh, yeah. Hooray!

23:24.070 --> 23:25.654
Let's have a big

23:24.070 --> 23:25.654
fucking party.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.823
Ricky got rid of his crabs.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.823
Bubs, I hope

23:27.907 --> 23:29.575
you're not blaming

23:27.907 --> 23:29.575
this whole thing

23:27.907 --> 23:29.575
on Rick and I,

23:29.658 --> 23:31.035
because we all

23:29.658 --> 23:31.035
fucked up together.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.912
You know that, right?

23:31.118 --> 23:32.912
Yeah, well.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.789
Some people fucked up

23:32.995 --> 23:35.789
more than others,

23:32.995 --> 23:35.789
didn't they, Julian?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.624
You know what? I'm sorry

23:35.873 --> 23:37.624
I got so fucking high.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.502
It was

23:37.708 --> 23:40.502
Tommy fucking Chong, man!

23:40.586 --> 23:43.214
And I told you there's

23:40.586 --> 23:43.214
a way we can fucking

23:40.586 --> 23:43.214
shoot this video

23:43.297 --> 23:44.464
and fund the

23:43.297 --> 23:44.464
whole thing, man.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.466
Don't even fucking

23:44.548 --> 23:46.466
go there, Julian.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.011
Well it's too bad,

23:46.550 --> 23:49.011
because it'd be

23:46.550 --> 23:49.011
twice as good now.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.637
What do you mean?

23:50.721 --> 23:53.349
I picked up

23:50.721 --> 23:53.349
another card.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.349
Oh, my fuck!

23:53.431 --> 23:55.809
Ricky:

23:53.431 --> 23:55.809
(Laughing)

23:53.431 --> 23:55.809
Oh, my fuck!

23:55.893 --> 23:57.353
I'm getting good

23:55.893 --> 23:57.353
at it, man.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.313
You took Rodman's credit card?

23:59.397 --> 24:02.524
Yes.

23:59.397 --> 24:02.524
You are fucking

23:59.397 --> 24:02.524
smooth, Julian.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.901
Bubbles:

24:02.608 --> 24:03.901
Pull the fucking

24:02.608 --> 24:03.901
van over,

24:03.984 --> 24:05.694
we're giving

24:03.984 --> 24:05.694
that card back!

24:05.778 --> 24:07.280
That's the end of it.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.280
We're not giving

24:05.778 --> 24:07.280
the card back.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.697
Keep driving!

24:08.781 --> 24:11.409
Pull the fucking

24:08.781 --> 24:11.409
van over, Julian.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.786
I've had enough

24:11.491 --> 24:13.786
of this shit.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.786
Bubs,

24:13.869 --> 24:15.579
we're not fucking

24:13.869 --> 24:15.579
pulling the van over.

24:15.662 --> 24:18.291
We're not giving

24:15.662 --> 24:18.291
this card back.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.043
(Voice breaking)

24:18.374 --> 24:21.043
Fucking pull the

24:18.374 --> 24:21.043
van over, Julian!

24:18.374 --> 24:21.043
Listen, Bubs,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.254
If you don't want

24:21.127 --> 24:23.254
me to fund this

24:21.127 --> 24:23.254
fucking thing,

24:23.337 --> 24:25.381
I'm staying here.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.381
You guys can leave,

24:25.463 --> 24:27.300
and I'm partying.

24:25.463 --> 24:27.300
I'll fucking stay here!

24:27.383 --> 24:29.176
We'll get some dope and

24:27.383 --> 24:29.176
some liquor and food,

24:29.260 --> 24:31.011
go to fucking Baz's

24:29.260 --> 24:31.011
party, this is...

24:31.095 --> 24:32.430
Julian:

24:31.095 --> 24:32.430
There we go.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.430
Yeah, man!

24:32.512 --> 24:33.680
There's an idea.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.680
(Chuckling)

24:33.764 --> 24:35.308
Pull the fucking

24:33.764 --> 24:35.308
van over, Julian,

24:35.391 --> 24:36.934
I'm not joking.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.934
Not happening.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.894
Oh, yeah?

24:37.017 --> 24:38.894
Yeah.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.894
Pull it over or else!

24:38.978 --> 24:40.146
Or else what?

24:41.230 --> 24:42.648
Or else that.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
Yeah?

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
Pull the fucking

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
van over!

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
Yeah?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.277
I've had enough

24:44.650 --> 24:46.277
of this shit!

24:44.650 --> 24:46.277
You want to keep

24:44.650 --> 24:46.277
shoving me?

24:46.360 --> 24:48.237
Bubs...

24:46.360 --> 24:48.237
Pull the van

24:46.360 --> 24:48.237
over, Julian!

24:48.321 --> 24:49.905
You keep your fucking

24:48.321 --> 24:49.905
hands off me!

24:49.989 --> 24:52.199
Just calm the

24:49.989 --> 24:52.199
fuck down here!

24:49.989 --> 24:52.199
You fucking want one?

24:52.283 --> 24:53.659
Yeah! Do I want one?

24:52.283 --> 24:53.659
You want one?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.411
Give me one!

24:53.742 --> 24:55.411
Give it to me!

24:53.742 --> 24:55.411
I'll fucking...

24:55.493 --> 24:57.537
Pull the fucking van over!

24:55.493 --> 24:57.537
Pull the fucking van

24:55.493 --> 24:57.537
over right now!

24:57.621 --> 24:59.748
I'm going to fucking

24:57.621 --> 24:59.748
unload on you!

24:57.621 --> 24:59.748
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

24:59.832 --> 25:01.583
What the fuck is

24:59.832 --> 25:01.583
wrong with you guys?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.627
Julian, you get the fuck

25:01.667 --> 25:03.627
out of the van, you're

25:01.667 --> 25:03.627
in fucking timeout.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.254
And you calm the fuck

25:03.710 --> 25:05.254
down and stay here,

25:05.338 --> 25:07.381
you're in

25:05.338 --> 25:07.381
timeout too!

25:05.338 --> 25:07.381
You're in timeout!

25:07.465 --> 25:09.467
Ricky:

25:07.465 --> 25:09.467
Man, you are being really,

25:07.465 --> 25:09.467
really fucking mean here.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.302
You're fucking

25:09.549 --> 25:11.302
out of line!

25:11.385 --> 25:13.095
That was fucking

25:11.385 --> 25:13.095
interesting.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.222
No shit.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.222
Why's he so fucking

25:13.179 --> 25:15.222
pissed off?

25:15.306 --> 25:18.476
Did we fuck up

25:15.306 --> 25:18.476
that bad?

25:15.306 --> 25:18.476
No, we didn't

25:15.306 --> 25:18.476
fuck up that bad.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.728
I'm not getting back in

25:18.558 --> 25:21.728
the van with him, though.

25:21.812 --> 25:22.980
(Sniffling,

25:21.812 --> 25:22.980
whimpering)

25:21.812 --> 25:22.980
Fuck that.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.773
What the fuck, man?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.773
(Whimpering)

25:24.857 --> 25:28.361
(Panting)

25:28.444 --> 25:29.653
I'm sorry!

25:29.736 --> 25:32.114
Okay? I'm sorry.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.114
I fucking snapped.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.491
It's just too

25:32.198 --> 25:33.491
much pressure.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.202
This is high stakes.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.829
You guys, I just want

25:36.285 --> 25:38.829
to do this legit.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.081
Why do you have to keep

25:38.912 --> 25:41.081
breaking the law, Julian?

25:41.165 --> 25:44.126
Bubs, the only way

25:41.165 --> 25:44.126
we're going to get

25:41.165 --> 25:44.126
a kick-ass video

25:44.210 --> 25:45.919
is if we break

25:44.210 --> 25:45.919
the law, man.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.296
And you're not

25:46.003 --> 25:47.296
going to go to jail.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.257
I'm signing everything

25:47.380 --> 25:50.257
off on the cards.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.759
We'd go to jail for you.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.759
We don't give a fuck.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.137
(Whimpering)

25:52.843 --> 25:55.137
I'm just... boys,

25:55.221 --> 25:57.139
I just... I'm

25:55.221 --> 25:57.139
worried, you know?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.975
If you guys go to jail

25:57.223 --> 25:59.975
in the U.S., that's it.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.227
You don't get out.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.936
And then I go

26:01.310 --> 26:02.936
home by myself

26:03.020 --> 26:05.147
and Bubbles

26:03.020 --> 26:05.147
is alone again...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.316
Bubs, we're...

26:05.231 --> 26:07.316
...never to see

26:05.231 --> 26:07.316
his friends again.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.609
We're not going

26:07.400 --> 26:09.609
to go to jail.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.609
We're not

26:07.400 --> 26:09.609
going to jail.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
These guys have

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
got millions,

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
probably drillions

26:09.693 --> 26:11.778
of fucking dollars.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.031
They're not going to

26:11.862 --> 26:14.031
notice three or four

26:11.862 --> 26:14.031
or ten grand missing.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.908
And they've got

26:14.114 --> 26:15.908
assistants, and

26:14.114 --> 26:15.908
they've got accountants.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.784
They're all looking at

26:15.991 --> 26:17.784
the transactions, man.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.412
They won't fucking

26:17.868 --> 26:19.412
have any idea.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.954
You think when

26:19.495 --> 26:20.954
you're rich as fuck,

26:21.038 --> 26:22.706
you're going to

26:21.038 --> 26:22.706
go through your

26:21.038 --> 26:22.706
credit card schemes?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.624
It's probably one

26:22.789 --> 26:24.624
of us and we probably

26:22.789 --> 26:24.624
won't even look at it.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.168
We'll just pay it,

26:24.708 --> 26:26.168
you'll have so much money.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.337
Fuck it!

26:26.252 --> 26:28.337
Big time, man.

26:28.421 --> 26:31.257
(Sigh)

26:28.421 --> 26:31.257
So much going on

26:28.421 --> 26:31.257
in there right now.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.300
We'll stay here and

26:31.340 --> 26:33.300
shoot a kick-ass

26:31.340 --> 26:33.300
video for you

26:33.384 --> 26:34.718
and have a fucking

26:33.384 --> 26:34.718
wicked party tonight.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.594
Get some food,

26:34.801 --> 26:36.594
maybe some ladies,

26:36.678 --> 26:38.889
go to Baz's party

26:36.678 --> 26:38.889
tomorrow night,

26:36.678 --> 26:38.889
get new flights

26:38.972 --> 26:40.349
and stay in

26:38.972 --> 26:40.349
a fucking bed.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.309
Yeah, a bed

26:40.433 --> 26:42.309
would be nice.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.229
Oh, fuck, a bed

26:42.393 --> 26:45.229
would be so nice.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.940
All kinds of pillows.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.359
A big bathtub to have

26:48.023 --> 26:50.359
a scrubby-dub in,

26:50.443 --> 26:51.860
would be nice.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.860
With room service.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.446
Let's fucking go with

26:51.944 --> 26:53.446
a bang here, boys.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.072
Julian, look.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.491
Just for

26:55.155 --> 26:57.491
the record, I...

26:57.575 --> 27:00.202
would never really

26:57.575 --> 27:00.202
clobber you or

26:57.575 --> 27:00.202
knock you out, okay?

27:00.286 --> 27:01.495
No, you wouldn't

27:00.286 --> 27:01.495
knock me out

27:01.579 --> 27:02.746
if you clobbered me.

27:02.829 --> 27:03.997
No, I almost did,

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
and I would have,

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
you know...

27:04.081 --> 27:06.041
No...

27:06.125 --> 27:07.543
bashed your teeth in

27:06.125 --> 27:07.543
or something.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.003
But I just mean I would

27:07.625 --> 27:10.003
never really do that,

27:10.087 --> 27:13.132
'cause I love you.

27:10.087 --> 27:13.132
No, it wouldn't

27:10.087 --> 27:13.132
happen anyway.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.426
(Sigh)

27:13.215 --> 27:15.426
So are we staying?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.344
I'm staying.

27:15.509 --> 27:17.344
I'll stay,

27:15.509 --> 27:17.344
but we...

27:17.428 --> 27:20.013
we need to keep it

27:17.428 --> 27:20.013
not too extravagant.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.723
(Chuckling)

27:20.097 --> 27:21.723
Awesome, buddy.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.142
Who's got your

27:21.807 --> 27:23.142
fucking belly?

27:23.225 --> 27:25.018
Deedle-deedle.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.018
Ricky...

27:25.102 --> 27:26.395

27:25.102 --> 27:26.395

27:26.479 --> 27:27.813
let me just calm down.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.231

27:29.315 --> 27:30.648
Deedle!

27:30.732 --> 27:32.485

27:32.568 --> 27:34.487
Don't ever slap

27:32.568 --> 27:34.487

27:34.570 --> 27:35.821
as long as you live.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.323
He just deedled

27:35.904 --> 27:37.323

27:37.406 --> 27:38.824
It's weird.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.993
Deedle.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.993
Let's go.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.993
Sorry, buddy.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.625
Can you cut that part off

27:43.996 --> 27:47.625
where they were grabbing me?

27:49.335 --> 27:53.046
( â™ª )

29:19.258 --> 29:24.096
(Seabirds squawking)

29:34.022 --> 29:38.444
Fishes:

29:34.022 --> 29:38.444
Oh fuck! Fuck!

29:34.022 --> 29:38.444
Fuck off! Fuck!...

29:38.527 --> 29:41.363
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:44.866 --> 29:46.243
(Whisper)

29:44.866 --> 29:46.243
<i>Fuck.</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:48.537
(Light clicks off)

29:46.326 --> 29:48.537
<i>Fuck off.</i>
