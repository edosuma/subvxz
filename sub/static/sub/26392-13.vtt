WEBVTT

00:03.435 --> 00:05.738

(chuckles)


00:03.435 --> 00:05.738

To an awesome night
at Coopers concert.


00:05.772 --> 00:07.272

(whoops)
Yay. Cheers.


00:05.772 --> 00:07.272

(whoops)


00:07.307 --> 00:08.474

Mm.


00:08.507 --> 00:10.377

(sighs)


00:14.314 --> 00:17.250

Oh, that takes me back.


00:18.283 --> 00:19.551

To what?


00:19.585 --> 00:23.088

Uh, our last HOA meeting.


00:23.123 --> 00:25.557

Oh, I can already tell Im
gonna get into a fight tonight.


00:25.591 --> 00:27.292

(chuckles)


00:28.327 --> 00:29.629

Ooh, Im so excited.


00:29.661 --> 00:31.231

We get full VIP treatment,


00:31.263 --> 00:33.298

which means free drinks.


00:31.263 --> 00:33.298

(chuckles): Yeah.


00:33.332 --> 00:35.134

(whoops)


00:33.332 --> 00:35.134

And-- Oh, my God.


00:35.167 --> 00:36.469

How is it already 8:40?


00:36.503 --> 00:37.670

8:40?


00:37.704 --> 00:40.807

Thats practically 9:15!


00:40.840 --> 00:42.307

Crazy.


00:40.840 --> 00:42.307

No. No.


00:42.341 --> 00:43.576

(yawning)


00:43.609 --> 00:45.411

Not tonight.


00:45.445 --> 00:46.880

We wont let you do that thing
where you get tired


00:46.912 --> 00:48.747

and talk yourselves out
of going out.


00:48.781 --> 00:51.250

Youre right, youre right.
Im sorry.


00:51.283 --> 00:53.118

Okay. Full VIP treatment.


00:53.152 --> 00:54.720

Backstage. Sold-out concert.


00:53.152 --> 00:54.720

Yeah.
Yep!


00:54.753 --> 00:56.456

(whooping)


00:54.753 --> 00:56.456

Yeah, it sounds great!


00:56.488 --> 00:58.258

Yeah.


00:56.488 --> 00:58.258

(chuckles)
(chuckles)


00:58.290 --> 01:00.426

But I did just get
a new pillow.


00:58.290 --> 01:00.426

Mm-hmm.


01:00.460 --> 01:03.329

And were going grocery
shopping tomorrow, you know?


01:03.362 --> 01:06.900

With all the driving
and the parking


01:06.932 --> 01:07.700

and then you forget
to validate


01:07.733 --> 01:09.569

and then you got
to go back inside.


01:09.602 --> 01:10.637

And theyre all like,


01:10.670 --> 01:12.371

"Validations for
customers only."


01:12.405 --> 01:14.641

And youre like, "I was
just in here, Janine!"


01:14.674 --> 01:16.376

CLAIRE:
Yeah, plus,


01:16.408 --> 01:17.676

we got to be fresh tomorrow,


01:17.710 --> 01:20.146

cause were meeting
with a life insurance agent.


01:20.180 --> 01:21.347

(laughs)


01:21.381 --> 01:23.349

Why do you guys need
life insurance?


01:23.382 --> 01:25.652

Youre zero risk.


01:26.686 --> 01:28.587

Well, actually,


01:28.620 --> 01:30.823

we have been talking
about...


01:30.856 --> 01:33.560

starting a family soon.


01:34.894 --> 01:36.728

JAKE:
Uh...


01:36.763 --> 01:38.298

youre not excited?


01:38.331 --> 01:40.834

Were just tired
of getting our hopes up.


01:40.866 --> 01:42.569

You two have been dangling
that carrot


01:42.602 --> 01:43.770

in front of us for so long


01:43.802 --> 01:46.840

weve got baby blue balls.


01:51.243 --> 01:53.278

No, I-I mean, wed
love to have kids.


01:53.313 --> 01:55.882

Its just, you know, its been
really crazy at work, you know?


01:55.914 --> 01:58.283

Um, but after tax season,
its gonna be, uh,


01:58.317 --> 02:00.920

"tax that ass" season.
(chuckles)


02:03.355 --> 02:05.757

Well, trust us, its good
to get your party days in


02:05.792 --> 02:07.260

before you have kids.


02:07.293 --> 02:10.530

Or someday you will find
yourself retired early


02:10.562 --> 02:13.265

and sneaking so much rosé
into your cornflakes


02:13.299 --> 02:15.200

you end up hitting
on the mailman.


02:16.536 --> 02:18.670

All I said is Jeff
has nice calves.


02:18.704 --> 02:21.341

What, now I
cant say facts?


02:21.373 --> 02:22.509

I dont want
to fight about it.


02:22.542 --> 02:23.909

Hey, guys.


02:23.943 --> 02:25.545

Whos ready to party?


02:25.578 --> 02:26.913

(whoops)


02:25.578 --> 02:26.913

(whoops)
All right.


02:26.945 --> 02:28.914

Um...


02:26.945 --> 02:28.914

Eh...


02:30.449 --> 02:31.818

(both suck in air through teeth)


02:31.850 --> 02:34.287

So... yeah.
(yawns)


02:34.319 --> 02:36.288

Is it okay if we take
a rain check?


02:36.322 --> 02:37.789

COOPER: Oh, yeah.
Yeah, for sure.


02:37.824 --> 02:39.992

Ill hit you up the next time
Ive sold out the Forum
three nights in a row


02:40.026 --> 02:42.528

and convinced Post Malone
to open for me.


02:43.562 --> 02:44.864

Great, man. Sounds
good. (chuckles)


02:46.900 --> 02:49.868

(yawns) Any idea
what a Post Malone is?


02:49.902 --> 02:51.236

Uh...


02:52.671 --> 02:56.909

I think its what you do
when youre finished Maloning.


02:57.944 --> 03:01.413

♪ Imagine me and you, I do


03:01.447 --> 03:04.317

♪ I think about you
day and night ♪


03:04.349 --> 03:06.019

♪ Its only right


03:06.051 --> 03:09.722

♪ So happy together...


03:09.756 --> 03:10.956

(vocalizing)


03:22.467 --> 03:23.836

(sighs)
Wow.


03:23.870 --> 03:29.808

All that sleep we got
was amaz-z-z-zing. Yeah.


03:29.841 --> 03:32.344

I added a few extra Zs
cause I caught so many.


03:32.377 --> 03:33.612

(chuckles):
Oh.


03:33.646 --> 03:34.948

I know. I tried
to wake you up,


03:34.980 --> 03:37.817

and you flipped me off
in your sleep.


03:37.849 --> 03:39.918

Oh, my God.
(groans)


03:44.090 --> 03:45.724

Wow.


03:45.758 --> 03:49.495

I guess Coopers after-party
mustve been cray.


03:49.528 --> 03:52.064

Do people still say "cray"?


03:52.098 --> 03:55.735

I think only when theyre
describing "how a bitch be,"


03:55.768 --> 03:57.402

but...


03:59.872 --> 04:01.441

All right, baby.


04:01.473 --> 04:03.308

Lets take out the trash.


04:03.342 --> 04:05.311

Okay. Yeah, Ill try
to wake em up.


04:05.344 --> 04:06.778

Um...


04:06.812 --> 04:08.448

Okay. Mommy. Dad.


04:08.480 --> 04:10.483

(groaning)


04:12.518 --> 04:13.652

Can I talk to em?


04:16.723 --> 04:18.358

(high-pitched):
Scuse me, uh,


04:18.391 --> 04:19.826

Bonnie,


04:19.858 --> 04:22.362

Gerald.


04:22.394 --> 04:24.463

Can you, uh...


04:24.497 --> 04:26.499

(air horn blows loudly)


04:30.702 --> 04:32.538

All right, folks,


04:32.572 --> 04:35.707

time to get up and
get goin, please.


04:35.742 --> 04:38.043

Your house is way
more comfortable,


04:38.076 --> 04:39.946

and its also...
(chuckles)


04:39.978 --> 04:41.047

...a lot quieter.


04:41.079 --> 04:43.081

(air horn blows)


04:47.420 --> 04:48.487

Soo!


04:48.521 --> 04:49.622

Okay.


04:49.656 --> 04:51.356

All cards on the table--


04:51.391 --> 04:52.824

either I dreamt
about peeing on your couch


04:52.858 --> 04:54.326

or I peed on your couch.


04:58.898 --> 05:01.100

(hissing)


05:04.137 --> 05:07.105

(door closes)


05:07.139 --> 05:07.874

Oh, hey, buddy.


05:07.906 --> 05:08.675

How was the concert?


05:08.708 --> 05:10.709

Well, I thought
it went well, but...


05:10.742 --> 05:12.644

according to this<i>L.A. Times</i>
review,


05:12.678 --> 05:14.913

"the venue was full,
but the songs were empty."


05:14.947 --> 05:16.716

And then he gave it


05:16.749 --> 05:20.052

four out of five poop emojis.


05:20.086 --> 05:22.922

Why do you care
what this reviewer says?


05:22.954 --> 05:26.391

Because.... cause
I kind of agree with him.


05:26.425 --> 05:28.427

You know,
Im 40 days into my tour,


05:28.461 --> 05:29.862

and I feel like I just sing


05:29.896 --> 05:32.130

the same shallow songs
over and over again.


05:32.165 --> 05:33.399

Dude, youre 21.


05:33.432 --> 05:34.600

What are you gonna sing about,


05:34.634 --> 05:36.435

opening a Roth IRA?
(chuckles)


05:36.468 --> 05:39.872

Why dont you try writing a song
thats more meaningful to you?


05:39.906 --> 05:40.673

Well, I have.


05:40.706 --> 05:41.807

Most of my songs
start out sincere.


05:41.841 --> 05:44.143

But then Id get scared
that my fans wont like them,


05:44.177 --> 05:46.144

so I increase the tempo,
add a beat,


05:46.178 --> 05:48.514

and then change the word "heart"
to "butt."


05:48.548 --> 05:50.115

Huh.


05:50.149 --> 05:52.451

That does explain...


05:52.485 --> 05:54.786

♪ Girl, relax your butt,
let my lovin flow ♪


05:54.821 --> 05:58.423

♪ Entwine your butt with mine,
let the lovin grow. ♪


06:02.461 --> 06:04.430

Claire, I-I knew you could sing,


06:04.463 --> 06:06.132

but you have
a really amazing voice.


06:06.165 --> 06:08.468

Oh, come on. I mean,
I dont know if thats...


06:08.500 --> 06:10.470

♪ True...


06:10.502 --> 06:12.071

♪ Yeah.


06:12.105 --> 06:13.773

Claire, Im serious.


06:13.805 --> 06:14.740

Well, uh, you know,


06:14.774 --> 06:15.807

if you want to sing
a more personal song,


06:15.841 --> 06:17.576

why dont you test it out
at your next concert?


06:17.610 --> 06:19.211

Because fans hate new music
at concerts.


06:19.245 --> 06:21.447

Have you ever been booed
by thousands of people?


06:21.480 --> 06:22.548

Yes.


06:25.218 --> 06:27.052

At Dodger Stadium,


06:27.086 --> 06:28.920

when I snagged a foul ball
from a small man


06:28.954 --> 06:30.956

who turned out to be a kid.


06:32.257 --> 06:34.994

In a wheelchair.


06:36.528 --> 06:39.564

Well, why dont you try doing
a smaller, more intimate show?


06:39.598 --> 06:40.432

What, alone?


06:40.466 --> 06:42.802

No-no backup dancers?
No pyrotechnics?


06:42.834 --> 06:46.471

Guys, Ill feel naked
without my laser tuxedo.


06:46.505 --> 06:47.807

I mean, you could
make it a duet,


06:47.840 --> 06:49.742

and then youll have
someone up there with you.


06:49.776 --> 06:52.011

Thats actually a great idea.


06:52.043 --> 06:54.079

I cant wait to start changing
my lyrics back


06:54.112 --> 06:55.648

from "butt" to "heart."


06:56.682 --> 06:58.084

Oh!


06:58.117 --> 07:01.187

Your latest single was supposed
to be "Eat Your


06:58.117 --> 07:01.187

<i>Heart</i>


06:58.117 --> 07:01.187

Out."


07:05.958 --> 07:08.661

Gosh, I cant believe how
healthy and safe you guys are.


07:08.694 --> 07:09.762

Youre on track for the lowest


07:09.795 --> 07:10.896

life insurance rate
Ive ever seen.


07:12.798 --> 07:15.500

So, just
a few more questions.


07:15.535 --> 07:17.502

Do you have any pre-existing
medical conditions?


07:17.536 --> 07:20.540

Well, Ive been told I have
too big a heart. (chuckles)


07:21.908 --> 07:22.841

Oh.


07:22.875 --> 07:25.978

You suffer from
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?


07:26.012 --> 07:27.646

No.


07:27.680 --> 07:29.615

No, I was just being cute.


07:29.649 --> 07:30.615

(chuckles)


07:30.649 --> 07:32.617

Now, do you have any kids?


07:32.651 --> 07:34.252

(chuckles)
Not that I know of.


07:34.286 --> 07:36.622

(chuckles)
Wait.


07:38.990 --> 07:41.226

That only works for guys.
(chuckles)


07:41.259 --> 07:43.129

Oh. Hey, guys.


07:43.161 --> 07:44.863

Dont mind me.
Im just grabbing a snack.


07:44.896 --> 07:46.298

Which, in this
house, are all...


07:46.331 --> 07:50.302

"low in sodium
and high in fiber."


07:50.336 --> 07:51.771

How-- W--


07:51.803 --> 07:54.173

Was that Cooper James?


07:54.206 --> 07:56.308

Um, does he live here?


07:56.341 --> 08:00.779

Yeah, its your, uh, standard
"millionaire pop star moves in


08:00.812 --> 08:02.048

"with his accountant
because he craves


08:02.081 --> 08:04.684

a sense of normalcy"
situation.


08:04.716 --> 08:08.588

But-but he could live<i>anywhere.</i>
(chuckles)


08:08.620 --> 08:10.122

Why would he choose here?


08:10.156 --> 08:12.124

Is--
Youre, like--


08:12.158 --> 08:14.192

Well, how do I say this
politely?


08:14.226 --> 08:17.129

Immensely boring.


08:17.163 --> 08:18.997

(chuckles)
Okay.
Um...


08:19.031 --> 08:21.199

We are not boring.


08:19.031 --> 08:21.199

Yeah.


08:21.233 --> 08:23.603

I mean, if you really
knew how we were,


08:23.636 --> 08:26.706

I mean, youd be hitting us
with a higher rate. (laughs)


08:27.807 --> 08:29.875

So youre committing
insurance fraud?


08:29.908 --> 08:32.010

No, no, no, no, no, no.


08:29.908 --> 08:32.010

No, no.


08:32.043 --> 08:35.581

All-- No, no. All the-- all
the answers we gave were true.


08:35.615 --> 08:36.749

CLAIRE: Yeah.


08:35.615 --> 08:36.749

You know? It just--
But they dont paint


08:36.782 --> 08:38.717

the full picture
of who we are.


08:38.750 --> 08:40.052

Like, were cool. Right?


08:38.750 --> 08:40.052

Were cool.


08:40.086 --> 08:41.988

I mean, Claire, tell her one
of our awesome stories.


08:42.020 --> 08:43.722

Hit her, man.


08:42.020 --> 08:43.722

Oh. Awesome. So,


08:43.755 --> 08:45.991

yeah, theres, uh,
the one ti-- um...


08:43.755 --> 08:45.991

Right?


08:46.024 --> 08:48.693

Get ready.
Oh! Oh.


08:49.695 --> 08:51.663

There was that one time


08:51.697 --> 08:54.567

that we almost committed
insurance fraud. (chuckles)


08:55.400 --> 08:57.970

Look, Im sorry
I called you boring.


08:58.004 --> 08:59.038

Its just that


08:59.071 --> 09:00.773

Cooper James is Cooper James.


09:00.806 --> 09:02.375

And, you know, youre...


09:02.408 --> 09:04.243

See, I already forgot
your names.


09:05.278 --> 09:07.178

No, but, seriously,


09:07.212 --> 09:09.282

you two dont need
life insurance.


09:09.315 --> 09:11.616

You need get-a-life insurance.


09:11.650 --> 09:14.287

(laughing)


09:14.320 --> 09:16.755

You know what, you might want to
look into fire insurance, too,


09:16.788 --> 09:18.658

after that sick burn.
(laughs)


09:19.692 --> 09:21.259

Oh, this is fun!


09:22.662 --> 09:24.129

(groans) Man, I guess we
dont have to try so hard


09:24.163 --> 09:26.131

at being boring,
cause we just are.


09:26.164 --> 09:28.067

Relax, Claire.
Thats just the opinion


09:28.100 --> 09:30.068

of someone who evaluates
the relative excitement


09:30.101 --> 09:33.205

of peoples lives
for a living.


09:33.239 --> 09:36.174

Jake, last night, we got
invited to a concert


09:36.207 --> 09:37.976

by the biggest
pop star in music.


09:38.009 --> 09:39.312

And, instead, we stayed home


09:39.345 --> 09:42.347

and ranked the months
of the year.


09:42.380 --> 09:44.283

Yeah, yeah,
I guess youre right.


09:44.317 --> 09:47.286

I, uh, guess we have gotten
into a bad habit


09:47.320 --> 09:49.187

of saying no to adventure.


09:49.221 --> 09:50.121

Great news, guys.


09:50.155 --> 09:51.990

I took your advice,
and, as of tonight,


09:52.024 --> 09:53.725

Im doing a small show
at the Troubadour.


09:53.759 --> 09:55.260

Oh, thats awesome, man.


09:53.759 --> 09:55.260

Yeah.


09:55.293 --> 09:57.163

Yeah, Im doing a duet
with Laurel Tyson.


09:57.196 --> 10:00.166

What?
Huh?


10:00.198 --> 10:02.000

The lead singer of Human Disco.


10:02.033 --> 10:04.836

Uh...
Come again?


10:04.870 --> 10:06.672

They had that hit song,
"Loser Police."


10:06.706 --> 10:09.174

Uh...
Uh...


10:09.207 --> 10:11.210

That they used
in that Nespresso commercial.


10:11.243 --> 10:12.177

Oh!
Oh!


10:12.211 --> 10:13.745

Yeah!


10:12.211 --> 10:13.745

(laughs)


10:13.778 --> 10:15.214

I love that song.


10:13.778 --> 10:15.214

That is such a good s--


10:15.246 --> 10:17.216

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


10:15.246 --> 10:17.216

So good. I would get it.


10:17.249 --> 10:19.118

You know, as usual, you guys
are welcome to come.


10:20.952 --> 10:23.154

But you probably have an excuse
as to why you cant.


10:23.188 --> 10:24.756

Nope. Not this time.


10:23.188 --> 10:24.756

No, Im pretty sure


10:24.789 --> 10:26.258

we can think
of something.


10:24.789 --> 10:26.258

No, I mean...


10:26.292 --> 10:28.159

I mean we should go.


10:28.193 --> 10:29.161

Were gonna go.
Oh.


10:29.195 --> 10:30.162

Right. Were gonna go.


10:29.195 --> 10:30.162

Were in!


10:30.196 --> 10:31.297

Really?
Yeah.
Yeah!


10:31.330 --> 10:33.231

Amazing. All right, well,
my driver will be here soon,


10:33.264 --> 10:35.234

if you want
to come with me.
Okay. Yay!


10:35.267 --> 10:36.302

I guess we
should change.


10:36.335 --> 10:37.903

No way.
You guys are amazing.


10:37.937 --> 10:40.272

Oh. You mean clothes.


10:43.075 --> 10:44.844

Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.


10:47.178 --> 10:49.447

♪


10:50.750 --> 10:52.985

Ive got to say, Jake,
you look pretty sexy


10:53.019 --> 10:54.220

in Coopers skinny jeans.


10:54.253 --> 10:56.187

Yeah, Claire, too sexy.


10:56.221 --> 10:58.890

Feels like
Im smuggling grapes.


10:56.221 --> 10:58.890

(laughs)


11:00.192 --> 11:01.293

Hey, there she is.


11:01.326 --> 11:03.395

Guys, this is
my duet partner, Laurel.


11:03.428 --> 11:05.464

So, are you excited to sing
with Cooper tonight?


11:05.498 --> 11:06.999

His new song is so good.


11:07.033 --> 11:09.168

JAKE:
Ah...


11:09.201 --> 11:10.769

Do you have, like, a
whole bunch of signs


11:10.802 --> 11:12.270

for different situations,
or just the one sign?


11:14.173 --> 11:16.207

Oh.


11:14.173 --> 11:16.207

Its just the one sign, okay.


11:16.241 --> 11:17.876

Were gonna go warm up.
You guys have fun.


11:17.909 --> 11:18.977

Those VIP bracelets


11:19.010 --> 11:20.879

give you access
to


11:19.010 --> 11:20.879

<i>everything.</i>


11:20.913 --> 11:22.380

Ooh.


11:20.913 --> 11:22.380

(laughing):
Oh...


11:24.283 --> 11:26.184

Hello.


11:26.217 --> 11:29.154

(giggles)


11:26.217 --> 11:29.154

(imitates cocking, firing gun)


11:31.222 --> 11:32.924

Oh...


11:32.957 --> 11:34.192

Jake, this is, like,
one of those parties


11:34.225 --> 11:35.260

where the prostitutes
are so fancy


11:35.293 --> 11:37.863

you cant tell them apart
from just a regular skank.


11:37.897 --> 11:38.998

(laughs)


11:39.030 --> 11:40.533

Oh, God, this is so fun.


11:40.566 --> 11:42.268

(yawning): Yeah, this was
just such a great call


11:42.301 --> 11:44.102

to come out tonight.


11:44.135 --> 11:45.403

No, Jake. You lock it up.


11:45.437 --> 11:46.538

Come on.


11:46.572 --> 11:48.073

Cool people dont yawn.


11:48.106 --> 11:50.241

They do awesome things,
like walk into a party


11:50.275 --> 11:52.110

and say, "Im bored."


11:52.144 --> 11:53.278

Youre right.
Youre right.


11:53.312 --> 11:55.280

Time to go huge.
Tonight we say good-bye


11:55.313 --> 11:58.183

to the old Jake and Claire who
get excited over simple things.


11:58.216 --> 12:00.186

Oh, jumbo shrimp.


12:00.219 --> 12:01.953

Look at all
these jumbo shrimp.


12:01.986 --> 12:03.254

Oh. Oh.


12:03.288 --> 12:05.124

Hey, man.
(chuckles)


12:05.157 --> 12:06.926

Dont sleep
on that garlic shrimp.


12:06.958 --> 12:08.561

You know what
Im saying? Ha-ha!


12:08.594 --> 12:11.096

Im cool. Hey,
you guys want to hit


12:11.129 --> 12:12.264

one of these?


12:12.298 --> 12:13.899

Oh?


12:13.932 --> 12:15.835

Oh, my God,
these are real live drugs.


12:15.868 --> 12:19.105

What do we do? Drug
people hate it when you
dont take their drugs.


12:19.138 --> 12:22.374

Okay, obviously, theres
only one thing to do here.


12:22.408 --> 12:24.009

Ah.


12:22.408 --> 12:24.009

Mm-hmm.


12:24.043 --> 12:26.077

Let me get one
of them things, man.


12:26.111 --> 12:28.114

I dont care
if its a weekday.


12:28.147 --> 12:30.515

You know what Im saying?
(chuckles)


12:30.548 --> 12:32.817

See you
on the other side, girl.


12:32.851 --> 12:34.320

(chuckles)
Mmm.


12:35.520 --> 12:37.155

Okay, you can spit yours out.


12:37.188 --> 12:38.423

What? I swallowed mine.


12:38.456 --> 12:40.058

What? Why?


12:40.091 --> 12:41.927

Because we said we were
gonna go huge tonight.


12:41.961 --> 12:44.462

That doesnt include taking
random drugs from a stranger.


12:44.496 --> 12:47.500

And we just shared
the "wed fake it" look.


12:47.533 --> 12:50.235

That wasnt a "fake it" look,
that was a "take it" look.


12:50.269 --> 12:52.270

Okay, this is a "fake it" look.


12:50.269 --> 12:52.270

Right.


12:52.303 --> 12:55.073

This is a "take it" look.


12:55.106 --> 12:57.509

Thats the exact same look.


12:57.543 --> 12:59.577

My God, Claire,
Im gonna die.


12:59.611 --> 13:01.312

(choking):
Its already
burning my throat.


13:01.346 --> 13:03.048

Okay, okay,
you know what?


13:03.081 --> 13:04.482

(hacking)


13:03.081 --> 13:04.482

Relax.


13:04.517 --> 13:06.451

Its a small pill.
Youre a big guy.


13:06.485 --> 13:09.087

Im sure that you can handle
whatever drug it is.


13:09.120 --> 13:11.356

Oh. Did you not want that?


13:11.389 --> 13:13.091

I guess theyre
a little strong.


13:13.125 --> 13:15.260

Wha... Who, me?
(chuckles)


13:15.293 --> 13:17.096

I already took mine, girl.


13:17.129 --> 13:19.097

This is his.


13:17.129 --> 13:19.097

(chuckles)


13:19.130 --> 13:21.000

Hes mine.


13:23.134 --> 13:23.969

(chuckles)


13:24.003 --> 13:26.238

Mmm.


13:24.003 --> 13:26.238

Okay, you can spit
that out now.


13:26.272 --> 13:28.039

I swallowed
that one, too.


13:26.272 --> 13:28.039

Why?!


13:28.072 --> 13:29.575

I panicked. Oh, my God,
Claire, what did I...


13:29.607 --> 13:30.942

what did I take?


13:30.975 --> 13:33.611

What if its one of
those drugs where I end up
eating someones face?


13:33.645 --> 13:36.148

Okay, you know what?
Just-just try to stay calm.


13:36.182 --> 13:38.017

Im gonna go ask
him what you took.


13:38.049 --> 13:41.486

(coughing):
Its probably bath salts.


13:41.519 --> 13:45.024

Oh, no. Ive become addicted
to my favorite way to relax.


13:45.057 --> 13:46.258

(hacking)


13:51.462 --> 13:52.932

Guys, Ill be
straight with you.


13:52.965 --> 13:55.100

I took a narcotic
tablet, and, uh,


13:55.134 --> 13:57.101

Im dealing with the real-world
consequences right now.


13:57.135 --> 13:59.205

(coughs)


13:57.135 --> 13:59.205

You, uh, seem fine.


13:59.238 --> 14:02.106

And even if Im not,
its okay, its okay.


14:02.140 --> 14:05.910

Okay, Jake, I asked the
dude what drug he gave you.


14:05.945 --> 14:07.546

What was it? Yayo? Smack?


14:07.580 --> 14:10.416

Fleck? Nurp-nurp? Quam?


14:10.448 --> 14:11.450

It was a mint.


14:11.482 --> 14:12.451

A mint!


14:12.484 --> 14:13.485

Oh, Ive never even
heard of that!


14:13.519 --> 14:15.053

(sobs)


14:15.086 --> 14:16.522

Is this, like,
a Class A narcotic?


14:16.554 --> 14:18.190

Yeah, "A" for Altoids.


14:18.224 --> 14:20.426

"A" for...


14:18.224 --> 14:20.426

He gave you a mint


14:20.458 --> 14:24.529

because your breath was so bad
from eating the garlic shrimp.


14:25.563 --> 14:26.999

I see.


14:28.500 --> 14:31.036

Ha! Yeah, man,
I knew that.


14:32.538 --> 14:35.573

I assume the patient-paramedic
confidentiality agreement


14:35.607 --> 14:37.243

will be honored?


14:37.275 --> 14:38.943

Well, thats not a thing.


14:38.977 --> 14:41.246

And Im definitely telling
all my friends.


14:41.279 --> 14:42.981

Okay.


14:47.219 --> 14:48.386

Uh...


14:48.419 --> 14:49.989

Sorry, you need a wristband.


14:50.022 --> 14:51.956

Um, uh, the medic
just ripped mine off.


14:51.990 --> 14:54.092

I was just in here,
man. Its me.


14:55.094 --> 14:56.528

Come on, man, I know Coop.


14:56.562 --> 14:59.030

Thats my guy.
Like, were best friends.


14:59.063 --> 15:00.599

Hes gonna sleep
in my attic tonight.


15:00.633 --> 15:02.567

Im wearing his pants.
Come on, let me in.


15:02.600 --> 15:05.303

We got a live one here.


15:02.600 --> 15:05.303

Oh...


15:05.336 --> 15:08.307

Hi, guys. Will you watch
from the side stage?


15:08.340 --> 15:10.542

Knowing youre here will
help ease my nerves.


15:10.576 --> 15:12.311

Yeah, of course well

15:12.344 --> 15:13.511

These guys are with me.


15:15.214 --> 15:16.481

Yeah.


15:16.514 --> 15:17.649

Uh-huh-huh.


15:17.682 --> 15:20.552

Look whos in the VIP area.


15:20.586 --> 15:22.388

Ha-ha-ha-ha.


15:22.421 --> 15:25.291

"We got a live one here."
Shut your ass up, man.


15:25.323 --> 15:27.192

Im up in your space!


15:29.193 --> 15:31.196

(beatboxing)


15:36.467 --> 15:38.470

Can I have my
microphone?


15:38.504 --> 15:40.306

Oh, yeah. Sorry.


15:40.338 --> 15:43.475

Warmed it up for you.
A little wet.
Yeah.


15:43.509 --> 15:44.777

Thank you.


15:44.809 --> 15:46.511

Guys.


15:46.544 --> 15:48.681

Im nervous.
What if my fans hate it?


15:48.713 --> 15:50.081

What if they love it?


15:50.115 --> 15:51.450

Youll never know
if you dont try.


15:51.482 --> 15:53.686

(sighs)
Thanks, guys.


15:53.719 --> 15:55.086

(chuckles)


15:56.120 --> 15:57.655

Hey.


15:57.690 --> 16:00.058

People said I was crazy
when I told them


16:00.091 --> 16:02.260

I was moving in
with my accountant, but...


16:02.293 --> 16:04.395

its the best decision
Ive ever made.


16:04.429 --> 16:07.332

Except for when I was 12
and I posted a video


16:07.365 --> 16:10.302

of me singing on YouTube
that got a billion views.


16:10.336 --> 16:11.570

Yeah.


16:11.602 --> 16:13.538

That was a good decision.


16:11.602 --> 16:13.538

(chuckles)


16:13.572 --> 16:14.706

Well, the feelings mutual.


16:14.740 --> 16:16.674

16:39.465 --> 16:41.567

I did.
And it was breathtaking.


16:41.600 --> 16:43.634

it on... the mike.
