00:12.513 --> 00:17.952
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
My teenage daughter is missing.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.158
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.261
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.764
Today is going to be
the longest day of my life.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.896
It is just after 7:00 a.m.
on the West Coast...

01:19.096 --> 01:22.099
...and the California Primary
is now officially underway.

01:22.299 --> 01:25.319
We're here outside the San Clarita
Power Plant in Los Angeles...

01:25.519 --> 01:29.356
...where Senator David Palmer will
be addressing local labor leaders...

01:29.556 --> 01:31.650
...and some members of the
state energy council.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.944
The senator has pledged
support for renovations...

01:35.612 --> 01:38.032
...that would advance this
power plant to production.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.116
Yeah?

01:39.316 --> 01:41.735
Bauer's on his way. Are you in yet?

01:41.935 --> 01:42.536
- Just about.
- Good.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.538
create thousands of new jobs.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.041
This promises to be a landmark day...

01:47.241 --> 01:50.711
...as it is expected that Senator Palmer
will get the delegates he needs...

01:51.211 --> 01:54.214
...to become the first African-American
presidential candidate...

01:54.715 --> 01:56.517
...of a major political party.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.720
Of the 11 states that will be
looking for delegates today...

01:59.920 --> 02:02.022
...California is expected to be crucial.

02:02.222 --> 02:07.227
And most of the polls say that David
Palmer will win by a decisive margin.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.732
Have you decided?

02:18.572 --> 02:21.275
I've rewritten the speech I was
going to give this morning.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.945
I'm going to tell them about Keith.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.950
What are you going to say?

02:30.150 --> 02:32.253
The truth.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.123
That seven years ago he was involved
in an accidental death.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.841
I need you to stand by me, Sherry.

02:38.342 --> 02:40.844
It's the only way to protect Keith.

02:43.347 --> 02:45.849
For the man seen as the best hope...

02:46.350 --> 02:49.053
...for their country's financial future.

02:49.553 --> 02:52.890
I will never forgive you if something
bad happens to my son.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.077
He's my son, too.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.613
We'll get through this.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.082
I hope so, David.

03:02.282 --> 03:06.537
We caught up with some voters
who started lining up at 6:00 a. m.

03:07.538 --> 03:08.872
Hey, ma.

03:09.373 --> 03:10.833
Good morning, honey.

03:11.033 --> 03:12.293
Where's your sister?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.211
Oh, she changed her mind. She's not going.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.712
Really?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.298
Yeah, she went to the airport
to pick up Susie and Rachel instead.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.801
Oh, that's right. The Brenner girls
are flying in.

03:22.553 --> 03:24.922
So, uh. what's gonna to happen this morning?

03:26.423 --> 03:28.058
We have to put this thing behind us, Keith.

03:28.258 --> 03:31.762
By me being in prison and
you in the Oval Office?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.263
Is that how we're going to put it behind us?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.015
You're not going to prison.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.567
You didn't do anything wrong.

03:36.767 --> 03:39.069
That's not how a jury will see it.

03:39.269 --> 03:41.905
Why don't you just have a little
faith in the system?

03:42.105 --> 03:44.208
What's this fairy tale
that you're living in?

03:44.408 --> 03:48.412
The world's going to believe that I
killed a white kid who raped my sister.

03:48.912 --> 03:51.281
Do you think that anyone will believe
it was an accident?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.249
Yes, I do.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.834
- Then you're a fool.
- Keith, no.

03:54.034 --> 03:54.835
No, that's all right.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.422
You talk about fairy tales.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.424
You think you can run from this?

04:00.924 --> 04:02.793
You think it's going to make things better?

04:03.293 --> 04:05.596
I'm not running anywhere.

04:05.796 --> 04:08.882
I'd just rather not spend my last
hour of freedom with you.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.888
Let's go and get this over with.

04:18.942 --> 04:20.277
Martin Belkin?

04:20.777 --> 04:21.911
Yes.

04:22.112 --> 04:24.014
Hi, I'm Jessica Abrams.

04:24.214 --> 04:25.791
I work for Senator Palmer.

04:25.991 --> 04:27.568
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.786
Can I help you with..

04:28.986 --> 04:30.988
- I got it.
- Okay. Great. Follow me.

04:32.322 --> 04:33.374
Is the senator here yet?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
Not yet, but he is on his way.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.377
Great.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.012
I am a huge fan of your work.

04:38.212 --> 04:39.713
- Thank you.
- Right this way, please.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.934
Hi.

04:44.134 --> 04:47.588
I'm going to be taking some
photographs of the senator.

04:53.393 --> 04:58.148
I need a check on a Belkin: B-E-L-K-I-N.

04:58.348 --> 04:59.650
First name, Martin.

05:05.239 --> 05:06.540
Clear on Belkin.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.193
All right, copy that. Thank you.

05:10.027 --> 05:11.745
You can go in.

05:38.222 --> 05:39.973
Turn right at the light.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.947
You see the bus stop on your left?

05:47.147 --> 05:47.831
Yes.

05:48.031 --> 05:49.533
Pull over to it.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.504
Hey, Jack.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.142
How are you doing?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.613
Don't touch it until I tell you to. Now, go.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.524
I'm not going anywhere until I can
talk to my wife and my daughter.

06:22.724 --> 06:25.435
Oh, you'll do this, because
it really isn't an inconvenience...

06:25.635 --> 06:27.237
...for me to hurt your daughter.

06:27.738 --> 06:30.073
Or your wife, for that matter.
In fact, here she is.

06:30.574 --> 06:33.110
Would you like to speak to your husband?

06:34.611 --> 06:36.997
Say anything you want.
Tell him you love him.

06:39.082 --> 06:40.467
- Jack.
- Teri?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.120
I don't know where I am yet,
and I haven't seen Kimberly...

06:43.620 --> 06:46.790
You were saying, Jack, you're
not sure you wanted to do this?

06:47.791 --> 06:49.401
That's what I thought.

06:49.601 --> 06:51.011
San Clarita Power Station.

06:51.211 --> 06:54.181
417 Ridgeway Road. Get over there now.

07:03.473 --> 07:04.975
This is only temporary, Mrs. Bauer.

07:05.475 --> 07:08.695
If Jack follows instructions, you'll
be released within the hour.

07:08.895 --> 07:09.997
Where's my daughter?

07:10.197 --> 07:12.199
She's here and she's safe.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.618
Could you take me to her, please?

07:59.246 --> 08:00.247
- Hey.
- What, Milo?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.499
- What happened to Nina?
- She got called out.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.251
What am I supposed to do about this keycard?

08:04.451 --> 08:06.453
Because this was supposed to be the
most important thing we're doing.

08:06.953 --> 08:07.954
They brought me in here
on the highest priority...

08:08.154 --> 08:09.756
...and now I'm just sitting around.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.958
I think Nina's got some new intel
that preempts this.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.877
That's why she had to run out.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.596
So, what should I be doing?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.397
Why don't you help me format some files?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.767
They didn't bring me in here
at 5:00 a.m. to format files!

08:53.917 --> 08:57.387
Does this kid Milo know he's working
on the wrong keycard?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.982
Is this going to be a problem?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.489
Nina Myers is dead.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.991
Make up a story for why she's not there.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.878
- Mom!
- Kimberly!

09:50.357 --> 09:52.225
It's okay.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.194
It's okay, honey.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.658
Where's Dad?

10:25.858 --> 10:27.060
I don't know.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.762
He knows we're in trouble?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.063
Yeah, he does.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.265
He's doing everything he can, baby.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.035
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.238
No, no, no, no. it's not your fault.

10:40.190 --> 10:42.075
It's not your fault, honey.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.581
Why don't you tell me about these boys?

10:52.586 --> 10:55.238
I met them through Janet, and...

10:55.438 --> 10:57.891
She started dating this guy, Dan...

10:58.091 --> 11:01.461
...and his friend Rick came into
town and we just hang out and... oh, God.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.466
They kept you here the whole time?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.467
Yes.

11:13.857 --> 11:15.225
Janet was hit by a car.

11:18.194 --> 11:19.613
I know.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.314
You do?

11:27.237 --> 11:29.739
We are going to get through this.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.241
I promise you.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.185
Hello?

12:30.216 --> 12:32.218
Come on, Jamey! Pick up!

12:54.040 --> 12:55.258
- Almeida.
- Tony.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.243
Nina, where've you been?

12:57.744 --> 12:58.545
I can't get into it.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.748
Well, force yourself. Where are you?

13:01.948 --> 13:04.250
Just east of downtown.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.553
What are you doing there?

13:06.753 --> 13:09.255
Tony, you have to listen to me carefully.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.674
No one at CTU can know I'm alive.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.894
Who would think you were dead?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.096
I can't tell you any more right now.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.097
Where's Jamey?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.432
She's working with Milo.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.233
Get her for me.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.235
No, not until you tell me what's going on.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.437
Please, Tony. This is an order.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.438
I need your help.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.941
All right.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.501
Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer.

13:38.701 --> 13:40.003
This is a giant waste of time.

13:40.203 --> 13:41.505
When is Nina coming back?

13:41.705 --> 13:43.707
Probably not for a couple of hours.

13:44.207 --> 13:45.041
What makes you say that?

13:46.543 --> 13:47.794
I just talked to her.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.096
When?

13:50.296 --> 13:51.222
A couple minutes ago.

13:51.422 --> 13:52.348
She's at Division.

13:52.849 --> 13:54.718
It's possible she'll be there all day.

13:57.353 --> 13:58.855
What do you need?

14:00.857 --> 14:02.358
Never mind.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.946
Look, if somebody doesn't tell
me what's going on right now..

14:07.146 --> 14:08.164
...I'm going to Chapelle.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.367
I told you, I have to speak to Jamey.

14:10.567 --> 14:14.571
Yes, and I just heard her tell Milo that
you'll be at Division all day.

14:15.572 --> 14:16.790
Oh, my God.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.992
- What?
- Who did she hear that from?

14:19.492 --> 14:20.877
She said she talked to you minutes ago.

14:21.377 --> 14:23.029
Nina, what is going on?

14:23.229 --> 14:24.881
We can't trust Jamey.

14:26.382 --> 14:28.468
Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.053
Are you saying Jamey's a spy?

14:30.253 --> 14:31.679
Why else would she lie?

14:31.879 --> 14:33.427
She must think I'm dead.

14:33.627 --> 14:35.175
Why would she think that?

14:35.375 --> 14:35.976
I'll explain later.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.394
You have to bring me back in now.

14:38.594 --> 14:40.396
Okay, I'll come get you.

14:40.596 --> 14:41.397
No, stay there.

14:41.898 --> 14:43.366
Act as if everything is all right.

14:43.566 --> 14:46.069
Jack was behaving very
strangely back at CTU.

14:46.569 --> 14:47.871
These people must be watching us.

14:48.071 --> 14:51.282
I don't know, probably through
our own surveillance.

14:51.482 --> 14:54.694
All right, look. I'll send a car.
What's your address?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.223
Senator. How are you?

15:43.459 --> 15:44.961
Copy that.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.811
GAII you have to do now Jack,
is get through security.

16:11.321 --> 16:14.657
Jack Bauer, CTU. I've been
cleared by Frank Simes.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.084
All right, I'll need you to open the case.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.085
Sure.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.101
What do you need a laptop for?

16:41.301 --> 16:45.188
Everything that we've compiled on Palmer
over the last eight hours is in there.

16:46.189 --> 16:48.942
You want to lift that up, please?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.203
Turn it on.

17:01.204 --> 17:02.705
Press any two buttons.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.502
All right, go ahead.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.003
Thank you.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.060
Thank you.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.762
Where is Senator Palmer now?

17:25.962 --> 17:26.762
He's on his way up.

17:26.963 --> 17:27.763
Good.

17:31.768 --> 17:32.769
Excuse me.

17:39.442 --> 17:40.827
Jack Bauer?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.446
Jessica Abrams?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.283
Yeah, Hi. What are you doing here?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.835
I'm working security.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.087
How many years has it been?

17:51.287 --> 17:52.889
Since high school?

17:53.089 --> 17:55.425
Yes. I'm sorry, I've got to get going.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.460
Are you still racing motorcycles?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.179
Keep moving, Jack.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.015
Not since my daughter was born.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.183
I'd like to catch up.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.051
Maybe later. I've just got to get going.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.219
Great, I'll be here.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.270
Okay.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.659
What do I do now?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.361
You'll hand the briefcase
to one of our people.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.329
Who?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.364
I'll tell you when it's time.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.400
Go wait by the buffet table.

18:37.550 --> 18:41.054
But now our election
coverage shifts to the polls.

18:41.471 --> 18:44.223
Back east, we've had some
interesting developments.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.957
Good to see you.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.715
Senator, I'd like you
to meet Martin Belkin.

19:26.049 --> 19:27.617
Good you could make it, Martin.

19:27.817 --> 19:29.385
Jessica says you're the best.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.303
Thank you.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.307
I look forward to working with you.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.243
Honey, you're so tired.

20:26.109 --> 20:27.610
Hi.

20:31.614 --> 20:33.916
I brought you some breakfast.

20:42.425 --> 20:43.342
Is Kim okay?

20:43.542 --> 20:44.460
Who are you?

20:45.461 --> 20:46.295
Rick.

20:46.796 --> 20:47.597
You kidnapped my daughter.

20:48.014 --> 20:48.848
I didn't know.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.234
How could you not know?

20:51.434 --> 20:52.935
I tried to help her get out, okay?

20:53.386 --> 20:55.354
Gaines wants to go
over some things with us.

20:58.107 --> 20:59.358
What's going on here, Rick?

20:59.558 --> 21:00.193
Nothing.

21:02.445 --> 21:03.446
Don't make friends.

21:03.946 --> 21:04.614
I wasn't.

21:04.814 --> 21:06.816
Good, they ain't gonna be
around much longer.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.651
- What do you mean?
- Move it.

21:20.329 --> 21:23.499
Okay, time to move,
Jack. Head across the floor.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.502
Excuse me.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.422
Excuse me.

21:32.842 --> 21:35.094
Okay, Jack, head towards the south wall.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.246
Hello, Jack.

21:37.446 --> 21:38.398
Hello, Jess.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.417
Do you remember Tracy Zigler?

21:41.617 --> 21:44.237
Yes. I just saw her last winter.

21:44.437 --> 21:48.824
Well, we keep in touch and she said
you and Teri got divorced.

21:49.024 --> 21:50.326
Get out of there.

21:50.826 --> 21:53.746
No, we just got separated.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.887
Jared, take care of this.

22:01.087 --> 22:05.258
If you want to get in touch,
reach me at this number here.

22:08.711 --> 22:10.012
Are you all right?

22:10.212 --> 22:11.380
I'm fine.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.299
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.101
- You sure?
- Yeah.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.111
He's heading across now.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.233
Make a left in front of the turbines.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.825
Show him your ID.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.044
Jack Bauer, CTU.

22:42.244 --> 22:43.963
That's my boy.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.169
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.847
Go to the end.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.153
On the left is Medical Station 3.

23:16.996 --> 23:17.997
I'm here.

23:18.497 --> 23:21.000
It's where I want you. Go in and wait.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.977
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

23:48.978 --> 23:50.479
I'm okay.

23:51.981 --> 23:53.816
You don't look okay.

23:58.537 --> 23:59.538
Is it safe to come in here?

24:00.039 --> 24:02.792
Yeah, I looped the cameras.
They can't see us.

24:05.294 --> 24:07.096
Why is Jack doing all this?

24:07.296 --> 24:09.799
They've kidnapped his wife and daughter.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.250
How long have you known this?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.552
Not long.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.053
You chose not to tell me.

24:14.253 --> 24:16.555
That's right. I was acting on orders.

24:16.755 --> 24:17.890
Screw orders!

24:18.090 --> 24:19.225
Tony, I'm sorry.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.027
Where's Jamey?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.229
She's still working with Milo.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.531
So what do you want to do?

24:25.731 --> 24:28.184
Restrain her and call in Division?

24:28.384 --> 24:29.986
No, we can't call anyone yet.

24:30.186 --> 24:32.530
- We've gotta do something.
- I know.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.874
This whole thing must be about Palmer.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.076
They're using Jack to stop
the investigation?

24:37.493 --> 24:38.578
Maybe.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.280
Hang on. We've got to do something.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.084
You sure this room is dark?

24:45.284 --> 24:48.287
I checked the log. There are
no active cameras.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.091
We've got to call Secret Service.

24:52.291 --> 24:56.011
No. The people holding Teri and Kim
will think Jack gave the order.

24:56.211 --> 24:59.932
I hate to say it, but it's not our problem.
We have to protect Palmer.

25:00.216 --> 25:01.717
We got to make the call now.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.018
Wait.

25:03.519 --> 25:05.471
Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.148
Let's try to find out more
before we do anything.

25:08.348 --> 25:10.526
Are you ordering me not to call
Secret Service?

25:15.698 --> 25:17.316
No, you're right.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.624
Hi, it's Tony. Can you get
me Agent Pierce's number?

25:47.680 --> 25:48.981
Assemble it.

26:30.689 --> 26:33.025
You want my prints on this weapon?

26:35.728 --> 26:39.782
Do you really think that anybody's going
to believe that I shot David Palmer?

26:55.748 --> 26:58.467
You better put that away.
Somebody might get hurt.

27:23.809 --> 27:28.647
We're watching the Senator work the room
before he gives the speech.

27:35.588 --> 27:37.423
Milo, come here.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.833
You were right.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.277
About what?

27:41.477 --> 27:44.096
The keycard was a forgery.
We found the original.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.139
- Where?
- Jack's office.

27:46.339 --> 27:48.183
Why did he swap it out?

27:48.383 --> 27:49.985
It doesn't matter.

27:50.185 --> 27:52.821
I sent it to Archiving to make
a backup of all the data.

27:53.021 --> 27:54.657
Then, it's going straight to you.

27:54.857 --> 27:56.158
You'll have to work quickly.

27:56.659 --> 27:58.160
Just get it to me.

28:00.996 --> 28:02.498
A forged keycard?

28:02.998 --> 28:04.566
What's that about?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.335
I have no idea.

28:18.213 --> 28:19.715
She's squirming.

28:24.687 --> 28:25.988
Almeida.

28:26.188 --> 28:28.190
This is Pierce from Secret Service.

28:28.691 --> 28:32.144
I called because we have some
new information you should know about.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.730
One of our agents, Jack Bauer,
might be there today.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.615
Yes, he's here. I cleared him.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.785
We learned that he may
have been compromised.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.955
He may not be acting to protect the senator.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.957
Are you saying he's a threat?

28:46.959 --> 28:49.828
Yeah. Take the appropriate actions.

28:51.213 --> 28:52.715
She's on the move.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.347
Okay, ladies restroom.
Second to last stall.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.232
The cameras are on a 20-second loop.

29:10.733 --> 29:11.759
Am I clear?

29:11.959 --> 29:12.985
No, not yet.

29:27.916 --> 29:29.835
Go. Got 20 seconds.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.878
Get out! Now!

29:44.600 --> 29:46.468
Grab it! All of it. Go!

29:53.609 --> 29:57.730
Can you tell if expectations
are high in the party for the speech?

29:58.614 --> 30:00.065
I got to keep you guys working.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.068
The fatter your paycheck, the more
taxes you can afford.

30:04.987 --> 30:06.238
That's right, Senator.

30:06.789 --> 30:08.323
Excuse me, guys.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.376
What's up?

30:10.576 --> 30:12.169
I just got a call from CTU.

30:12.369 --> 30:13.962
We need to get you out, sir.

30:14.162 --> 30:14.713
Why?

30:14.913 --> 30:17.049
There's a problem with one of their agents.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.667
What kind of problem?

30:18.967 --> 30:21.554
He could be a threat to you.

30:21.754 --> 30:25.174
If he's one of ours, why don't you
find him and take care of this quietly?

30:25.374 --> 30:26.975
We are trying, sir.

30:28.761 --> 30:30.062
I'll tell you what.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.623
I'll lose the face time,
but the speech stays.

30:32.823 --> 30:34.984
There's something I have
to say this morning.

30:35.184 --> 30:37.836
With all due respect,
I think it's a mistake, sir.

30:38.036 --> 30:40.689
This information comes directly
from CTU headquarters.

30:43.158 --> 30:46.195
I am sure your people will
take care of this.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.465
All Right! Everyone on the floor,
listen up. This is Pierce.

30:58.665 --> 31:02.711
Palmer has decided to proceed.
I repeat, Palmer will remain.

31:02.911 --> 31:05.714
We need to locate and detain a suspect...

31:05.914 --> 31:08.467
...whose name is Jack Bauer.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.269
Bauer is 5'11".

31:10.469 --> 31:12.805
Blond hair, 160 pounds.

31:13.272 --> 31:18.007
He is wearing a dark brown jacket
that may display CTU ID.

31:18.307 --> 31:20.749
This is Hayes. Spotting
is possible on Bauer.

31:20.849 --> 31:22.314
How would you like me to proceed?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.316
All right. Hold your position.
I'll be right there.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.400
Copy.

31:34.910 --> 31:36.411
Hi, Jamey.

31:39.081 --> 31:40.983
What's this all about?

31:41.183 --> 31:43.085
Why don't you tell us?

31:43.385 --> 31:45.329
I have no idea what you're talking about.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.251
Who were you contacting in the bathroom?

31:47.451 --> 31:48.974
None of your business. It was personal.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.618
Are they the same people who
set me up to be killed?

31:51.818 --> 31:54.263
Set you up to be killed?
What are you talking about?

31:54.463 --> 31:55.781
We don't have time for this.

31:55.981 --> 31:59.902
Talk to us, Jamey. Who's got Jack's
wife and daughter?

32:00.102 --> 32:03.071
- What are they making Jack do?
- I don't know.

32:03.572 --> 32:05.891
Richard Walsh is dead.
So is Scott Baylor.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.410
You'll be charged with
murder and treason.

32:08.911 --> 32:10.746
I suggest you start telling me
what's going on.

32:12.247 --> 32:13.749
They said no one would get hurt.

32:13.949 --> 32:14.750
Who are they?

32:15.751 --> 32:17.035
I can't tell you.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.588
Tell us everything you know!
It's your only way out!

32:19.788 --> 32:21.590
Do you understand!

32:23.091 --> 32:28.347
I was just supposed to tap into the
surveillance of all the security cameras.

32:28.630 --> 32:31.300
Then they asked me
to send messages from inside.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.551
What messages?

32:33.385 --> 32:34.887
What messages!

32:38.390 --> 32:40.392
Mostly about Jack.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.895
Then about the keycard.

32:44.897 --> 32:48.283
I didn't know this was going to happen.
You have to believe that.

32:48.483 --> 32:51.286
Fine, we do. But now
you need to help us.

32:51.787 --> 32:53.539
Who were you doing all this for?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.943
No. I have to talk to someone first.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.212
What? No! There is no time, Jamey.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.998
Palmer is exposed. Jack's family is
in danger.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.717
You have to start talking to us now!

33:09.137 --> 33:10.589
All right, Jamey.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.091
I'll make sure they cut you a deal, okay?

33:17.229 --> 33:21.733
No. I'm not saying anything,
not until I get Agency counsel

33:45.874 --> 33:47.976
Sit!

33:48.176 --> 33:51.880
As Mayor of LA, I'm often given
the opportunity...

33:52.080 --> 33:54.090
...to meet some truly remarkable people.

33:54.290 --> 33:56.301
People that strive for the greater unity.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.104
People that work to make
our world a better place.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.407
One of those people is here today.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.610
And "remarkable" only begins
to describe this man.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.112
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president
of the United States...

34:08.313 --> 34:10.616
...and my good friend, David Palmer.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.824
I love you, Kimberly.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.775
You know that?

34:38.777 --> 34:39.911
Yeah.

34:42.914 --> 34:43.915
Good.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.754
It's important that you know that.

34:50.205 --> 34:53.292
Mom, if you're feeling guilty
about our fight yesterday...

34:53.792 --> 34:55.043
...I'm over it.

34:55.543 --> 34:56.645
I just want to get home.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.430
It's not why I'm saying that.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.933
We're stuck in this awful place...

35:01.133 --> 35:03.635
...and I just want you to know that
you're not alone.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.441
Mom, you're scaring me.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.564
Sounds like you're saying this
'cause something bad will happen.

35:15.764 --> 35:16.982
No, no.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.486
It's just...

35:24.489 --> 35:29.494
I'm trying to explain to you what a simple,
powerful thing my love for you is.

35:32.798 --> 35:35.100
So, no matter how bad things get...

35:35.300 --> 35:38.086
...or how good they get,
that's not going to change.

35:41.590 --> 35:44.509
I just don't know how to do
anything but love you.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.114
Thank you.

36:07.115 --> 36:08.033
Thank you very much.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.970
Thank you.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.839
I'll be right back.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.062
Thank you, Mayor Nelson.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.382
And thank you, kind citizens
of Los Angeles.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.889
Identification, please.

36:31.390 --> 36:35.277
You know, this country depends
on a healthy economy in California.

36:38.113 --> 36:41.566
And the nucleus of that economy is energy.

36:41.766 --> 36:43.452
All right, Jack. Step out.

36:43.652 --> 36:44.903
We're ready for you.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.207
To do what?

36:48.407 --> 36:52.044
Relax. It will be over in five minutes.

36:52.244 --> 36:55.247
...is standing right
here in this room today.

37:00.001 --> 37:01.002
It's you!

37:01.503 --> 37:02.304
Do you see the photographer?

37:02.504 --> 37:04.973
The men and women
who serve this industry...

37:05.474 --> 37:06.775
Yes.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.977
Go over and join him.

37:18.737 --> 37:22.741
After he shoots Palmer,
he will hand you his weapon.

37:22.941 --> 37:23.909
You've got to be kidding me.

37:24.109 --> 37:27.612
I know you'll be tempted to intervene
but you must believe me, Jack...

37:27.812 --> 37:30.615
...if you do, your family dies and we'll
get Palmer anyway.

37:33.618 --> 37:34.753
I understand.

37:34.953 --> 37:38.882
When I started my campaign,
over a year ago...

37:39.082 --> 37:42.811
...I made a promise to you
who've supported me.

37:43.011 --> 37:46.882
That my campaign would be built on
integrity, commitment...

37:47.299 --> 37:48.800
...and above all, honor.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.389
Thank you.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.777
Thank you.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.641
Palmer!

38:04.841 --> 38:06.284
Thank you.

38:08.653 --> 38:12.123
Integrity, commitment, honor.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.910
Anything less would be unacceptable.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.963
Agent Bauer.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.990
Alan Hayes, Secret Service.
I need you to come with me.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.718
- What's the matter?
- No problem. Just come with me.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.093
Seven years ago...

38:33.311 --> 38:34.763
Gun!

38:35.814 --> 38:37.516
Blanket Palmer.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.572
- Get him out of here.
- Get Sherry.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.448
I can't see exactly...

38:45.648 --> 38:47.075
Palmer's being shielded.

38:47.275 --> 38:47.743
But why?

38:47.943 --> 38:50.161
Bauer? Bauer? What's happening?

38:50.361 --> 38:51.446
Did you screw me?

38:52.447 --> 38:53.665
I didn't do this.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.083
Do you understand?

38:55.584 --> 38:57.786
Please, don't hurt my family.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.089
Don't hurt my family.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.141
I'll help. I promise. Please!

39:03.341 --> 39:06.511
That's it, we're done.
Kill the wife and kid!

39:13.218 --> 39:14.719
Get out of here!

39:33.788 --> 39:35.790
I don't have time for this.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.387
- Hello?
- What do you want?

39:48.587 --> 39:51.089
Division picked up
Bauer at the power plant.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.390
They've been looking for him all night.

39:52.590 --> 39:53.475
Why?

39:53.675 --> 39:56.394
He's been breaking protocol
since you got to him.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.562
Damn it!

39:59.931 --> 40:00.932
Take me!

40:02.434 --> 40:03.935
No!

40:09.157 --> 40:11.159
No!

40:18.450 --> 40:20.085
Mom! No!

40:25.707 --> 40:26.708
No!

40:31.379 --> 40:32.847
Don't!

40:37.185 --> 40:38.687
Please don't...

40:48.697 --> 40:50.240
Eli.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.783
Yeah.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.985
I still need them alive.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.488
Both of them?

41:08.917 --> 41:11.920
Yes. Take them back.

41:23.932 --> 41:26.768
No! No!
