Previously on
The Shannara Chronicles...

00:08.500 --> 00:10.060
- Eretria...
- Welcome back, Short Tips.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.067
If Allanon's your father,
who's your mother?

00:14.133 --> 00:16.300
She was King Eventine's sister.

00:16.367 --> 00:17.800
You know, in a previous life,

00:17.867 --> 00:20.333
I had a cause and a purpose
I was willing to die for.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.833
Sounds like the Weapons Master
has a secret past.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.200
I need to see Riga.

00:24.267 --> 00:25.667
Not possible.

00:25.733 --> 00:27.667
My mother hates the elves.

00:27.733 --> 00:30.167
This alliance is
some kind of maneuver.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.833
Allanon was
taken by the Crimson.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.233
Someone set him up.

00:41.533 --> 00:43.800
Bring me the Druid
or your uncle dies.

00:46.267 --> 00:47.267
You let him go!

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:12.600 --> 01:13.800
Who are you?

01:17.433 --> 01:19.967
An old friend sent me.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.700
Guards!

01:24.967 --> 01:26.267
Arrest this intruder.

01:28.067 --> 01:29.233
Arrest him!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.533
"Intruder," Your Highness?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.933
Unfortunately,
they can't see me.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.367
What do you want?

02:00.700 --> 02:02.800
No, it's not me.

02:02.867 --> 02:05.467
It's the Warlock Lord.

02:05.533 --> 02:08.199
He'll be back soon and he's
come to collect on his deal.

02:08.267 --> 02:10.500
- He was destroyed.
- No,

02:10.567 --> 02:12.433
merely delayed.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.367
And he has a very long memory,

02:17.567 --> 02:20.400
so allow me refresh yours.

02:23.067 --> 02:24.533
Do you remember the Mord Wraiths

02:24.600 --> 02:28.066
that encircled this city
during the War of the Races?

02:28.067 --> 02:31.300
Choked you off from
the outside world...

02:32.467 --> 02:35.733
Until you made
a certain deal, that is.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.833
I was young, and my people
were starving.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.900
Mmm, and that pact
saved your kingdom.

02:41.967 --> 02:44.733
It allowed
your people to flourish.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.767
But you banked on the fact that
he would never come to collect.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.067
Is this your idea of a threat?

02:53.067 --> 02:55.367
Think of it as a reminder

02:55.433 --> 02:58.433
of what could happen
to your people

02:58.500 --> 03:01.700
should you not honor
your arrangement.

03:01.767 --> 03:04.533
'Cause you see, when it comes
to the Warlock Lord,

03:06.167 --> 03:07.700
debts are always paid.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.433
That blade you're holding
is made with Mennonite steel.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.200
The only people who forge
weapons with it

03:58.267 --> 04:00.066
are the swordsmiths of Leah.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.667
And every Crimson soldier
was armed with one.

04:02.733 --> 04:06.267
Riga's men certainly have
a foothold in the kingdom.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.533
Which means the Queen
may also be complicit.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.367
Eretria,

04:11.433 --> 04:13.333
you must go back
and warn King Ander

04:13.400 --> 04:14.909
that he is nesting
with a pit of vipers.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.533
I should stay here with Wil.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.100
The Ellcrys said that he's in...

04:18.166 --> 04:21.100
The Ellcrys understands that
each of us has a part to play.

04:23.967 --> 04:27.533
I won't let anything
happen to Wil. I promise.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.367
And you'll go with her.

04:30.567 --> 04:33.400
I'll get her to the city,
magic man,

04:33.467 --> 04:34.467
but then I'm out.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.700
Wil's stable,

04:36.767 --> 04:38.833
but the Elder Stor said
that he lost a lot of blood.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.367
He was asking for you.

04:52.733 --> 04:56.233
Well, I'm gonna go...

04:56.300 --> 04:58.067
Polish my sword.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.133
What do you want?

05:05.200 --> 05:07.600
You're a Druid, right?

05:07.667 --> 05:09.067
Read my mind.

05:13.533 --> 05:17.400
You think you're my daughter,
but that is not possible.

05:17.467 --> 05:19.400
'Cause you don't want it to be?

05:22.267 --> 05:23.433
Don't worry.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.043
I've spent my whole life
without a father,

05:25.067 --> 05:27.700
I'm not looking for one now.

05:27.767 --> 05:30.200
I was just hoping that
maybe you could help me.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.767
She said that
you would reject me.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.967
That looking for you
was a mistake.

05:41.167 --> 05:42.800
It is a mistake.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.233
You need to rest.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.066
I can't.

06:05.067 --> 06:09.233
We have to be in Paranor by tomorrow
or Bandon will kill my uncle.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.700
- Then I'm coming with you.
- No.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.933
It's too dangerous.

06:14.067 --> 06:15.300
Why are you pushing me away?

06:15.367 --> 06:17.500
I already lost you once.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.633
The last thing I want
is to lose you again.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.933
If we're both lucky enough
to survive this,

06:26.067 --> 06:27.800
we'll meet up again.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.300
Sure.

06:37.333 --> 06:39.367
I found these in Graymark.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.833
Figured you might need them.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.133
I'm coming back.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.533
Then I'll see you
when I see you.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.267
See you when I see you.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.300
My scouts lost them
in the woods.

07:26.633 --> 07:28.200
But they did find this.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.133
Incompetence won't be tolerated.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.333
Get word to Edain.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.333
We need to secure
that weapons shipment.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.066
It'll be difficult
with the King there.

07:56.067 --> 07:58.067
You find a way!

08:24.567 --> 08:26.567
We need to get going.

08:26.633 --> 08:29.833
- You're not fit to travel.
- I'm fit enough.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.900
We can't afford
to waste any more time.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.933
I don't trust Bandon
to keep Flick alive.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.366
You two talk?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.299
She had a lot to say.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.866
You don't believe her.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.633
I've read her mind.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.067
She believes herself
to be my child.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.700
It's not possible.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.633
She used your staff, didn't she?

08:52.567 --> 08:54.567
The Druid's sleep,

08:54.633 --> 08:57.167
I was told that it prevented
me from having children.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.467
Maybe they were wrong.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.067
Isn't it worth
trying to find out?

09:15.067 --> 09:18.200
Let's go!
We need to hit the road.

09:18.267 --> 09:21.233
The sooner we get to Paranor,
the sooner we save Flick

09:21.300 --> 09:23.567
and end this once and for all.

09:42.067 --> 09:45.667
I'd think twice
about reaching for that sword.

09:45.733 --> 09:47.933
I'd kill you
before you reached it.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.367
Where did you
disappear to last night?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.033
I thought you were asleep.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.067
It's hard to sleep
tied to a tree.

10:11.600 --> 10:15.267
I was making preparations
for the Warlock Lord's return.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.400
You think the Warlock Lord
is your salvation?

10:18.467 --> 10:19.867
Think again.

10:21.033 --> 10:22.267
You'll end up like

10:22.333 --> 10:24.400
all those other creatures
he's enthralled.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.200
A mindless slave.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.867
When I found you,

10:28.933 --> 10:30.333
your town was burned
to the ground

10:30.400 --> 10:33.100
and you were cowering
in the ashes.

10:33.167 --> 10:35.033
If that's your idea of freedom,

10:35.100 --> 10:36.267
you can keep it.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.467
I'm not naive, boy.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.933
The Crimson are fanatics,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.767
but their cruelty is no match
to the Warlock Lord.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.133
I've seen what he
can do to good people.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.267
Hmm.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.367
Allanon practically
delivered me to the Dagda Mor.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.133
He drove your brother to madness

10:55.200 --> 10:56.400
and he broke Wil's heart.

10:57.933 --> 11:01.066
All so that he could save
the world for the good people

11:01.067 --> 11:03.067
who don't give a damn
about people like me.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.200
You're wrong.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.533
I'm not.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.333
And I can prove it.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.400
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.433
I still have both my eyes.

11:52.967 --> 11:55.067
Those tattoos on your hand...

11:57.833 --> 12:00.133
You were in the Border Legion?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
That was a long time ago.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.367
When all hope was lost,

12:09.433 --> 12:14.333
and bodies stacked
knee-deep...

12:14.400 --> 12:16.100
They called us.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.800
My men were the best.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.167
You said "were."
What happened?

12:25.267 --> 12:27.267
Routine scouting mission.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.667
Gnomes making noise
around the Borderlands.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.967
Turns out...

12:36.067 --> 12:38.067
It wasn't gnomes at all.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.667
It was demons.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.066
Pack up.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.900
We got a long ride ahead of us.

12:59.567 --> 13:02.066
Has there been
any word from Catania?

13:02.067 --> 13:04.167
Not a whisper.

13:04.233 --> 13:07.233
It's not like her
to just disappear.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.967
What exactly did she say
when you last spoke to her?

13:10.067 --> 13:13.200
I told you, she was trying
to make a graceful exit.

13:13.267 --> 13:15.900
Your engagement wasn't
sitting well with her.

13:15.967 --> 13:18.567
She was the one who insisted
I cement the alliance.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.433
Lose the scowl.

13:39.733 --> 13:42.967
King Ander,
you remember Princess Lyria.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.867
Of course.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.300
She makes quite an impression.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.533
I'll leave you
to get acquainted.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.066
Enough chaperones for you?

13:59.067 --> 14:02.066
Yeah, they're nervous
that I'll run away.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.467
I heard that's a hobby of yours.

14:04.533 --> 14:07.233
I've heard a lot about you, too.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.500
Why don't we take a walk
and compare intel?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.433
What are we doing here?

14:28.500 --> 14:31.200
Putting your theory about
good people to the test.

14:44.267 --> 14:46.267
Excuse me.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.867
Uh, my uncle and I
are traveling to Arborlon

14:48.933 --> 14:51.833
and we're in need of food
and lodging for the night.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.300
I'm sorry to impose.

14:55.267 --> 14:56.767
No trouble.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.967
Always happy to
help a fellow elf.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.800
Thank you.

15:11.133 --> 15:14.700
- The terrain is treacherous.
- We walk from here.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.733
Sorry about him.
He's not a real people person.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.200
I don't care
about having a father.

15:19.267 --> 15:20.500
I just need a teacher.

15:20.567 --> 15:22.133
I don't remember passing
through here

15:22.200 --> 15:23.933
the last time
we went to Paranor.

15:24.067 --> 15:26.066
We're taking a detour.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.300
You're doing that thing again,

15:27.367 --> 15:29.933
where you don't tell me
what's really going on.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.100
Well, this is Wolfkstaag.

15:32.167 --> 15:35.133
Old magic from the Great Wars
is rooted here.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.133
We don't have time for this.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.933
We need to get to Paranor.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.400
Bandon is under the thrall
of the Warlock Blade.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.300
He is bringing us to Paranor

15:43.367 --> 15:45.833
as part of his ploy
to raise the Warlock Lord.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.967
We agreed we were going
to rescue Flick,

15:48.067 --> 15:49.200
regardless of the risks.

15:49.267 --> 15:51.067
I will not allow you
to sabotage that.

15:51.633 --> 15:53.333
I am not.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.067
But if Bandon succeeds,

15:55.100 --> 15:57.433
we will need the only weapon
that can defeat him.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.100
The Sword of Shannara.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.367
The Sword is buried in Tyrsis.

16:04.433 --> 16:06.167
That was just a cover story.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.567
Then where is it?

16:08.533 --> 16:10.200
It's buried with your father.

16:22.967 --> 16:26.167
That's the most fun I've had
in a long time. Thank you.

16:26.233 --> 16:29.200
Thank you for understanding
my situation.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.067
The fact is, I still need
your mother's aid.

16:33.133 --> 16:36.900
So, I'm at an impasse
if you decline my proposal.

16:36.967 --> 16:39.067
The only thing she can't
control are my feelings.

16:39.667 --> 16:40.933
I love Eretria,

16:41.067 --> 16:42.367
and I'm not gonna let

16:42.433 --> 16:44.833
my mother's political
maneuvers destroy that.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.967
I'm glad to hear it.

16:48.067 --> 16:51.100
Eretria,
what are you doing here?

16:51.167 --> 16:53.567
It's a Crimson sword.
Got it back at Graymark.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.500
The whole battalion
was armed with them.

16:55.567 --> 16:57.767
No mistaking it's Leah steel.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.067
And it's not
just the swords, Ander.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.433
I saw them take Allanon.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.067
They're working with
someone inside the kingdom.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.833
I sent Catania to warn you.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.700
She never reached me.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.599
Edain told me
she returned to Arborlon.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.599
He's lying.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.633
She wouldn't have gone
without telling you.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.833
I knew something was wrong.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.099
I pressed him about it.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.267
Edain and I grew up together,
he's family.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.833
Come on. Slanter should be
able to track him down.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.700
This is a beautiful home.

17:36.167 --> 17:38.200
I'm surprised it wasn't
ripped apart by the demons.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.733
So were we.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.533
We've been here
less than a year.

17:43.867 --> 17:45.167
And how'd you get so lucky?

17:46.533 --> 17:49.567
Well, truth be told,
nobody wanted it.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.267
Said it was cursed.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.533
Folks who lived here
before had a boy,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.533
kept him locked in the barn.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.633
Well, that's how you
treat an animal, not a child.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.066
Apparently,
they didn't have a choice.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.567
He was dangerous.

18:02.633 --> 18:03.767
"Dangerous"?

18:04.967 --> 18:06.933
- How so?
- Magic.

18:08.167 --> 18:09.600
Show him, boy.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.800
They used this to muzzle him.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.100
Our neighbors told us
they heard him screaming

18:28.167 --> 18:29.733
about demons coming.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.600
Then, that night, they showed
up and murdered his parents.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.333
Mmm.

18:35.933 --> 18:38.300
Maybe he was
trying to warn them.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.300
Maybe he was one of them.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.400
Some people just come
into the world damaged.

18:46.467 --> 18:47.533
Like a lame foal.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.467
There's no fixing it,
you just put it down.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.300
I mean, that "it" was
an innocent child.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.700
There's nothing innocent
about magic.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.333
As far as I'm concerned,

19:01.400 --> 19:04.333
magic is the cause
of all the ills in the world.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.200
So you believe all magic users

19:09.267 --> 19:10.867
should be treated with cruelty?

19:10.933 --> 19:12.933
I think they should be treated
with death.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.533
Make the world a safer,
better place.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.066
Hmm.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.533
I mean, you're right.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.300
You're absolutely right.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.633
When people are bad,

19:30.700 --> 19:34.100
there's just no reasoning
with them.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.900
I don't get it.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.567
Of all places in the Four Lands,

20:12.633 --> 20:15.467
why would my father choose
to be buried here?

20:15.533 --> 20:18.433
He didn't want anyone coming
to look for him.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.233
After all that Shea had seen,

20:20.300 --> 20:21.833
he could not fit
into the normal world.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.600
He tried to adapt,

20:24.667 --> 20:27.067
to make a life for you
and your mother,

20:27.133 --> 20:30.000
but he found it too hard
to blot out the past.

20:30.067 --> 20:33.900
Still, this is not anyone's
idea of a resting place.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.467
Your father never intended
for you to wield the Sword.

20:40.533 --> 20:43.900
It is a powerful weapon
of magic.

20:45.067 --> 20:47.500
And magic always has
a price, right?

20:49.067 --> 20:50.800
If wielding that sword
is what I need to do

20:50.867 --> 20:53.000
to save Flick, then I will.

21:28.233 --> 21:30.800
The Sword,
I can sense its presence.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.133
This way.

21:43.167 --> 21:44.167
Stay close.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.700
Let's keep moving.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.400
Greetings, my brothers.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.833
I have the weapons
that General Riga requested.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.100
I need to return

22:21.167 --> 22:22.687
before King Ander questions
my absence.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.100
Pretty sure I have all
the answers I need.

22:45.733 --> 22:47.067
Stay where you are!

22:50.467 --> 22:51.533
Where's Catania?

22:52.200 --> 22:53.267
Dead.

22:56.433 --> 22:58.633
You murdered her!

22:58.700 --> 23:00.633
We're getting stronger
every day.

23:00.700 --> 23:01.933
You'll never defeat us.

23:09.467 --> 23:11.067
We'll see about that.

23:16.533 --> 23:18.200
This place is like a labyrinth.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.500
You guys go that way,
I'll look down here.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.333
We should stick together.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.776
No, there's too much ground
to cover.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.800
We'll never find the Sword
if we don't separate.

23:26.867 --> 23:28.567
Are you sure that's a good idea?

23:28.633 --> 23:30.067
I have the Elfstones.

23:30.133 --> 23:31.733
I'll be fine.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.900
You stay with Allanon
and his winning personality.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.400
He's stubborn,
just like his father.

23:43.533 --> 23:44.767
Come on.

23:52.233 --> 23:53.673
We, uh, don't have room
in the house,

23:53.733 --> 23:55.467
but you're welcome
to sleep in the barn.

23:59.400 --> 24:02.367
Actually, I'd prefer to sleep
in my old room.

24:03.633 --> 24:05.233
It's the one with the blue bed

24:05.300 --> 24:08.300
and the window
that overlooks the hills.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.733
You see,
this used to be my home.

24:16.433 --> 24:19.700
I sat at this table,
played in that yard.

24:21.400 --> 24:26.233
I was locked away in that barn.

24:36.533 --> 24:38.867
Are these the good people
you're so intent on saving?

24:38.933 --> 24:40.500
Bandon, please.

24:44.367 --> 24:47.733
I tried to save my family
from the demons...

24:47.800 --> 24:48.833
No.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.333
But they wouldn't listen.

24:57.133 --> 24:59.600
- No!
- No! No! Help!

25:00.500 --> 25:02.200
Please, please, don't!

25:02.267 --> 25:03.600
No, no! Please!

25:04.933 --> 25:06.133
No!

25:07.467 --> 25:09.066
No!

25:09.067 --> 25:10.467
No! Help!

25:17.133 --> 25:18.567
- Dad!
- No!

25:18.633 --> 25:21.133
Bandon, don't do this.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.433
Please!
Please, have mercy on him!

25:30.700 --> 25:33.067
- I'm afraid I can't.
- No!

25:33.100 --> 25:34.433
I was born damaged.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.500
No!

25:42.067 --> 25:43.133
No!

25:43.967 --> 25:45.067
No!

25:47.967 --> 25:49.067
No!

26:09.567 --> 26:11.500
If you wanna know something,
you can just ask.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.067
It's called having
a conversation.

26:19.467 --> 26:21.600
Okay.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.533
When did your magic manifest?

26:24.300 --> 26:25.633
I was 10.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.900
I was sitting on a beach,

26:28.967 --> 26:31.733
wishing a great fleet of ships
would come whisk me away

26:31.800 --> 26:33.733
from my boring life.

26:35.067 --> 26:37.067
And then, there they were.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.467
Clear as day.

26:38.533 --> 26:41.100
Broad sails flapping
in the wind and everything.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.333
I went to tell my mom
what I'd done

26:43.400 --> 26:45.067
and I will never forget it.

26:46.167 --> 26:50.067
The look of pure dread
on her face.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.567
She told me to stop.

26:55.067 --> 26:56.987
And when she found out,
it only made her angrier.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.100
She kept telling me that

26:59.167 --> 27:02.733
it was a curse passed down
to me from my father.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.800
And did your magic change
as you got older?

27:10.067 --> 27:11.667
It got stronger.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
But also more unpredictable.

27:15.233 --> 27:16.533
Dangerous.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.500
In what way?

27:21.900 --> 27:23.833
Illusions come easy,

27:23.900 --> 27:26.933
they don't require much control.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.533
But when I get upset,
or if I'm angry...

27:33.400 --> 27:36.100
The last time that
I used real magic,

27:37.733 --> 27:39.367
I hurt someone...

27:41.233 --> 27:42.400
Someone I loved.

27:42.467 --> 27:45.067
And that is why
I came looking for you.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.400
So you can help me control it.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.067
I'm not trying to make you
something you're not.

27:51.133 --> 27:53.066
I just want you to teach me.

27:53.067 --> 27:54.967
That is not a good idea.

27:55.067 --> 27:57.567
Are you even listening to me?

27:57.633 --> 28:00.500
Without your help,
I might hurt someone again.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.600
I need you.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.433
I'm not moving a step further
until you agree.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.600
What the hell is that?

28:16.633 --> 28:17.867
A Dweller.

28:17.933 --> 28:19.067
Move!

28:40.933 --> 28:42.067
Wil!

28:42.667 --> 28:43.800
Wil!

28:47.400 --> 28:48.467
Wil!

28:54.933 --> 28:56.267
Allanon?

28:56.333 --> 28:57.633
Mareth?

29:06.300 --> 29:07.367
Wil!

29:18.100 --> 29:19.267
It has him.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.567
Then we have to find its nest.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.367
It's this way.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.233
What will it do to him?

29:39.300 --> 29:41.367
The Dweller feeds off pain.

29:41.433 --> 29:44.533
Right now, Wil is reliving
his deepest trauma.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.067
If we don't find it,
it will kill him.

29:52.467 --> 29:53.900
Wha...

30:03.500 --> 30:04.767
Allanon!

30:04.833 --> 30:06.167
Mareth!

30:27.733 --> 30:30.000
That'll teach you
to mess with Wil Ohmsford,

30:30.067 --> 30:32.333
master swordsman of the Vale!

30:33.867 --> 30:34.933
Watch this, Dad.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.267
Give it to me. Now!

30:37.333 --> 30:39.000
Never touch that! Ever!

30:39.067 --> 30:40.967
You can't touch the Sword!

30:42.833 --> 30:45.067
Dad... Stop, please! No!

30:54.100 --> 30:55.776
Don't look me in the eye
and tell me you had no idea

30:55.800 --> 30:57.000
what was going on.

30:57.067 --> 30:58.309
It's not the first time
your sword was seen

30:58.333 --> 30:59.443
in the hands of the Crimson.

30:59.467 --> 31:01.733
Ironic, you questioning
my loyalties

31:01.800 --> 31:03.767
when you had a Crimson
in your inner circle.

31:03.833 --> 31:06.433
One of your closest friends,
no less.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.267
These are treacherous times.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.066
No one is immune.

31:12.067 --> 31:15.600
You can be sure my soldiers
will be punished accordingly.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.867
My daughter means everything
to me.

31:17.933 --> 31:20.067
I will not allow her safety
to be compromised,

31:20.100 --> 31:22.200
no matter how much
I may value this alliance.

31:22.267 --> 31:24.567
I'm sure Lyria will be glad
to hear it,

31:24.633 --> 31:27.467
since she has no intention
of marrying me.

31:27.533 --> 31:29.833
She loves another.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.300
Edain will be dealt with,
you have my word.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.066
But I need yours.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.233
Can I count on your support

31:36.300 --> 31:38.400
in squashing the Crimson
once and for all?

31:38.467 --> 31:40.400
The Kingdom of Leah
will not abide terrorism

31:40.467 --> 31:41.567
within its walls.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.066
That's propaganda,
not a promise.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.700
You have my word.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.100
I guess time will tell
what that's worth.

32:27.967 --> 32:29.067
Over here.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.167
Get back!

33:16.733 --> 33:18.300
Everybody okay?

33:32.733 --> 33:34.967
You've been found guilty

33:35.067 --> 33:37.300
of conspiring with the Crimson.

33:37.367 --> 33:40.367
Those who perpetuate violence,

33:40.433 --> 33:43.200
hatred or terror

33:43.967 --> 33:45.600
must be punished.

34:24.132 --> 34:26.833
Is this really what you wanted?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.933
To become a martyr
for a hateful cause?

34:30.067 --> 34:32.400
You're my oldest friend.

34:32.467 --> 34:34.800
After all we've been through,
why did you betray me?

34:35.632 --> 34:37.433
I tried to reach you...

34:38.733 --> 34:41.100
But you wouldn't listen.

34:41.167 --> 34:44.833
Wouldn't hear of the pleas
of your own people.

34:44.900 --> 34:47.699
The Crimson became their voice.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.199
Catania was one of those people

34:49.266 --> 34:50.333
you defend so valiantly.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.467
Did you think twice
before murdering her?

34:54.533 --> 34:56.833
I did what had to be done.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.267
For a cause greater than myself.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.867
Something you could never do.

35:15.100 --> 35:17.667
You've underestimated me
for the last time.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.167
Eretria?

35:44.700 --> 35:46.633
You're still here.

35:46.700 --> 35:49.133
I wouldn't leave without
a proper goodbye.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.367
You've got this, Princess.

36:14.367 --> 36:16.067
I wish I had your confidence.

36:17.567 --> 36:21.600
You really have no idea
how much power you have.

36:22.533 --> 36:24.567
What are you talking about?

36:25.233 --> 36:26.733
Your mother.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.100
She needs you way more
than you need her.

36:30.867 --> 36:32.367
Remember that.

36:54.233 --> 36:56.067
You know,
King Ander sees right through

36:56.100 --> 36:58.367
your little charade.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.233
He knows
you're supporting the Crimson.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.467
So now he's confiding in you?

37:04.533 --> 37:06.700
That's a change for the better.

37:07.833 --> 37:10.467
Oh, on the contrary,

37:10.533 --> 37:13.400
I'm done being your pawn.

37:13.467 --> 37:16.933
If I marry him,
it's gonna be on my terms.

37:18.233 --> 37:20.567
When I'm on the throne
at Arborlon,

37:22.100 --> 37:24.433
you won't be able to count
on my support.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.133
What exactly do you think
you're doing?

37:29.633 --> 37:32.067
What you do best, Mother.

37:32.900 --> 37:34.300
Negotiating.

37:36.367 --> 37:38.300
So if you want me as an ally,

37:38.367 --> 37:42.067
you're gonna start treating me
as an equal.

37:42.133 --> 37:44.700
And you're gonna
leave Eretria alone.

37:58.367 --> 38:00.100
This is the place.

38:19.433 --> 38:21.900
He looks exactly
like I remember.

38:37.533 --> 38:40.200
Your father
was afraid to have children.

38:40.267 --> 38:41.609
He didn't want to pass on
the burden

38:41.633 --> 38:44.066
of being a Shannara.

38:44.067 --> 38:46.833
He knew that
no matter what he'd done,

38:46.900 --> 38:51.066
you would be called,
and that broke him.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.100
Whatever you think you knew
about your father,

38:54.533 --> 38:58.133
always remember that
he carried you in his heart,

39:00.367 --> 39:02.267
like any father would.

39:13.400 --> 39:17.333
I was angry at you
for a long time,

39:19.400 --> 39:21.367
that you'd abandon us.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.133
For all you did...

39:29.667 --> 39:31.767
I didn't understand why.

39:37.367 --> 39:39.533
But I understand now.

39:42.700 --> 39:46.967
You were trying to protect me
and Mom.

39:56.567 --> 39:58.600
That's what family does.

40:05.767 --> 40:08.300
I'm sorry that
you had to die alone.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.033
I'm sorry
we didn't have more time.

40:23.533 --> 40:25.400
I've seen this before.

40:27.533 --> 40:29.600
You hid it in the barn.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.667
I thought it was just
a regular sword.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.867
It was the last day I saw you.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.367
I thought
it would look different.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.300
More...

41:18.167 --> 41:19.600
I don't know,

41:19.667 --> 41:21.100
impressive.

41:21.167 --> 41:24.533
Do not be deceived
by its simplicity.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.100
The Sword of Shannara is
the most powerful weapon

41:27.167 --> 41:29.233
ever forged.

41:29.300 --> 41:33.067
Yet it is only as strong
as the man who wields it.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.467
It will show you your truth.

41:37.567 --> 41:39.933
But you must be prepared
to see it.

41:47.933 --> 41:49.733
You don't think I'm ready.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.067
Nobody is ever ready.
