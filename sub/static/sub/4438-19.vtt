WEBVTT

00:09.218 --> 00:10.595
End times
are here, folks.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.604
Only way to salvation
is to embrace

00:12.763 --> 00:14.640
the triangular ways
of our overlord.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.397
Any object with more than
three sides is sinful.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.482
That's it. That's probably
what Bill wants.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.404
( Screaming )

00:21.563 --> 00:23.486
I reckon I've been
living a lie.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.125
Ladies, gentlemen,

00:33.325 --> 00:36.204
that creature with, like,
87 different faces.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.209
Eighty-eight
different faces.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.131
Oh, sorry.
Touchy subject.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.334
Anyways, it's been fun
turning Gravity Falls

00:42.543 --> 00:45.797
inside out, rounding up
all its terrified citizens

00:46.004 --> 00:47.631
and then stacking them
into this massive

00:47.839 --> 00:49.056
throne of frozen
human agony.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.556
( Voice echoes )

00:55.055 --> 00:57.183
Don't worry, they're not
conscious anymore.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.517
Probably.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.066
My omelets... they have
friendly faces.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.150
Whoops.
Back you go there.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.359
But Gravity Falls
is just the beginning.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.162
It's time to take
our chaos worldwide!

01:10.320 --> 01:12.618
All right, boys,
to the corners of the earth.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.621
Set the world aflame
with your weirdness.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.623
This dimension is ours!

01:16.827 --> 01:19.580
Ah, global domination.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.711
I could get used to...

01:22.708 --> 01:24.130
What?!

01:31.717 --> 01:35.767
Hm, this might be
more complicated than I thought.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.393
I think
I broke something.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.646
Walk it off!

02:01.079 --> 02:04.458
Mabel. Mabel!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.509
Okay, guys, Bill has
taken over the town,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.303
and if
this weirdness spreads,

02:08.502 --> 02:09.846
he's gonna take over
the whole world.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.890
Our first step to
stopping him is rescuing Mabel,

02:12.090 --> 02:15.014
but he's got her trapped in
this strange prison bubble.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.721
What is this place
anyway?

02:23.602 --> 02:27.027
Guys, if I die,
I wanna die hugging.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.527
Soos, you're choking me.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.734
Let my body
be your shield.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.410
(all yelling )

02:35.238 --> 02:38.538
Is the entire ground
a bouncy castle?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.085
Do you hear
'80s music?

02:40.243 --> 02:43.247
And does the air smell
like childlike wonder?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.128
ALL: Whoa!

02:47.084 --> 02:49.257
DIPPER:
This is Mabel's prison?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.304
Yes. Definitely.
Absolutely.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.802
( Bell tolls )

02:53.006 --> 02:54.508
MAN:
It's fun o'clock, everyone.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.343
Today's weather calls for
rainbows

02:56.551 --> 02:59.304
with a chance of
dance parties.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.016
If you're the owner of
a unicorn with a top hat,

03:02.224 --> 03:03.771
please come to
the ice cream beach.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.774
Your unicorn
is being towed.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.480
What is this new world?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.862
Shining, shimmering,
splendid.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.580
Welcome to Mabeland.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.532
<i>♪ Mabeland I'</i>

03:18.740 --> 03:20.788
And this is worse than
the apocalypse.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.790
Dude, this place
hurts my eyes.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.337
Oh, that's normal.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.165
Mabeland's rainbows
have colors

03:26.373 --> 03:27.499
only bees and art students
can see.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.177
Now who wants to go
on the grand tour?

03:30.377 --> 03:33.472
- Do we have a choice?
- BOTH: No!

03:34.756 --> 03:36.554
Mabeland is the ultimate
paradise,

03:36.758 --> 03:38.977
and the only rule--
there are no rules!

03:39.177 --> 03:41.350
Except for one rule,
which is very serious.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.432
But no one would
ever break it,

03:43.598 --> 03:45.191
so it's not
worth mentioning.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.565
BOTH: Yeah!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.191
Listen, creepy dream guys,
we're not here to party, okay?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.740
We just need to find Mabel
and get her out of here.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.738
Where is she?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.694
Our home girl Mabel
lives at our next stop.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.740
That rules!

04:01.158 --> 04:02.284
Now come have
rad snacks

04:02.492 --> 04:04.494
served by
awesome penguins.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.377
Oh, score.
I'm so hungry.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.924
Yeah. I haven't eaten
anything

04:09.082 --> 04:11.426
except for part of my hat
for the last three days.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.503
Can you guys
just hold on a second?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.259
Do you see
what's happening here?

04:15.464 --> 04:17.762
Don't forget, this world
was created by Bill.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.641
That punch
is probably blood.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.273
And that glitter rain is probably
ground-up bones or babies or something.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.522
Bill's using Mabel's
own fantasies

04:27.684 --> 04:29.686
as some sick trap.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.863
We need to grab Mabel
and get the heck outta here.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.612
Oh, Mabel? She's at
the top of the tallest tower,

04:34.816 --> 04:37.444
guarded by those
big, buff waffle guards.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.404
There's no way
to get past them.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.241
Someone hand me
some syrup.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.292
( Screaming )

04:44.493 --> 04:46.666
It's happening.
The moment we trained for.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.713
Don't worry, man.
I gotcha.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.257
( Screams )

04:50.457 --> 04:51.458
It's now or never, guys.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.336
This is a rescue.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.012
Everyone hit the deck.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.178
SOOS:
Hang in there, Mabel!

05:02.344 --> 05:03.470
There she is.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.684
Soos, grab her.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.516
Wendy, barricade
the door.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.564
UP Yo" 9°,
little lady.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.197
Soos? Wendy?
Dipper?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.569
The waffles
are coming back.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.493
- We gotta hurry!
- Uh, guys.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
Don't worry, Mabel.
We'll get you out of this.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.656
But Dipper...

05:30.747 --> 05:32.340
Mabel, what are
you doing?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.464
We're trying to save you
from this prison.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.295
This isn't a prison.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.595
I made this world.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.548
Well, I sorta woke up here.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.475
- It's complicated.
- What are you saying?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.724
I'm saying this is
my home now,

05:44.928 --> 05:46.646
and I don't wanna
be saved.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.189
- Sorry, Mabel.
- No worries, bubble bear.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.448
- You did what?!
- Look, after you said

05:56.648 --> 05:58.992
you wouldn't come back home with
me at the end of the summer

05:59.192 --> 06:00.535
for your "apprenticeship,"

06:00.735 --> 06:03.033
I wanted to hide
in my sweater forever.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.206
But then I woke up
in a place that gives me

06:05.365 --> 06:06.833
exactly what I wanted--

06:07.033 --> 06:09.456
an endless summer where
we'll never have to grow up.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.755
Here, the sun shines all day,
the party never ends,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.834
and now that you guys are here,
it's finally perfect.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.422
Listen, Mabel,
we're not here to party.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.344
All of this is crazy.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.175
Ugh! I figured <i>you</i> might say
something like that, Dipper.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.259
That's why I've prepared
a backup Dipper

06:24.467 --> 06:25.684
with a more supportive
attitude.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.267
Whoa!

06:28.471 --> 06:30.644
Uh, yeah!

06:30.849 --> 06:33.193
Wiggity-wiggity
what's up, dude bros?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.645
I'm Dippy Fresh.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.981
I like skateboarding,
supporting my sister,

06:37.188 --> 06:40.192
and punctuating every
third sentence with a high five.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.947
Oh, don't mind if I...

06:42.152 --> 06:43.825
Ahem!

06:44.029 --> 06:45.656
I'm sorry. I can't
leave him hanging.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.208
- Yes.
- You're dead to me, Soos.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.786
Trust me. You guys
are gonna love it here.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.792
This world always
knows what you want,

06:52.996 --> 06:54.964
sometimes even
before you do.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.922
Apparently I wanted
a chinchilla.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.799
Right again, Mabeland.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.838
Mabel, listen to yourself.
This is crazy.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.640
I'm sorry about our fight,

07:03.798 --> 07:05.675
and I'm sorry
things aren't great right now,

07:05.842 --> 07:08.470
but that doesn't mean
you can just stay in here forever.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.522
Hey, take a chill pill.
Those grow on trees here.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.523
You stay out of this,
Dippy Fresh!

07:12.682 --> 07:14.480
Dude, calm down.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.815
Dippy Fresh didn't do
anything to you, dawg.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.487
( Growling )

07:17.687 --> 07:19.109
I know it seems
too good to be true,

07:19.314 --> 07:21.316
but just give
this place a chance.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.281
Mabeland knows
just what you want,

07:23.443 --> 07:24.615
and always provides.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.950
Pudding center.
Nice.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.707
Actually, Mabel,
I'm with Dipper on this.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.709
Gravity Falls is in trouble,
and I really think--

07:34.913 --> 07:36.665
( horn honking )

07:39.626 --> 07:40.878
ALL: Wendy!

07:41.044 --> 07:43.138
Guys? You're safe.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.466
We've got a monster truck
full of fireworks, fake ID's,

07:45.674 --> 07:47.551
and pranking supplies.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.432
Wanna drive this truck
to the high school

07:49.636 --> 07:51.479
and glue this plunger
to the principal's head?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.933
Yes. Yes, I do.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.733
Sorry, guys. I've always
wanted to do that.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.811
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.905
<i>ALL: Whoa-hoe!</i>

08:01.106 --> 08:02.574
- Wendy?
- Don't worry, dude.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.742
There's nothing in this world
that could break me

08:04.943 --> 08:06.911
from our mission.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.286
Soos <i>mi hijo.</i>
I have returned.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.788
Holy... whoa, whoa.
Dad?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.495
You don't remember
what I look like,

08:14.703 --> 08:16.330
so I have the body
of a pro wrestler,

08:16.538 --> 08:18.540
and a face you once saw
on a hot sauce bottle.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.592
I was never there for you,
but in this world, I can be.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.591
- You're perfect.
- It's a trap.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.093
Don't go with him, Soos,
no matter what he offers you.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.299
Want to play catch?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.634
I'm sorry, dude.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.553
Even if it is
all a dream,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.347
I've gotta play
just one game.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.227
Come on, Dad.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.230
Okay, this has
gone too far.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.812
You can't honestly think these
fantasies are good for anyone.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.818
You can't argue with
the results.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.615
People are happy here.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.193
Does it really matter
if it's real or not?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.578
For once, stop listening
to your head,

08:48.778 --> 08:50.530
and listen to your heart.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.618
Mabeland has something
for everyone, even you.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.702
In fact...

08:57.787 --> 09:00.256
Nope. Not looking.
Not looking.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.471
(all groaning )

09:06.671 --> 09:08.799
All right, can anybody
explain to me why,

09:09.007 --> 09:12.011
even with our newfound
infinite power...

09:14.637 --> 09:16.514
none of us can escape
the borders

09:16.681 --> 09:19.525
of this stupid
hick town?!

09:19.684 --> 09:22.187
There's some kind of
force field keeping us in.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.568
But who would know
how to fix it?

09:24.773 --> 09:29.700
Hmm. Maybe someone needs
to come out of retirement.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.405
Bill. Sorry, boss,

09:31.613 --> 09:34.036
but Gideon let
the Pines family escape.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.917
They're inside Mabel's
bubble as we speak.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.461
( Evil laughter )

09:38.661 --> 09:40.709
Mabel's bubble is
the most diabolical trap

09:40.914 --> 09:42.632
I've ever created.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.300
It would take
a will of titanium

09:44.501 --> 09:46.299
not to give into
its temptations.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.597
Fetch me Gideon, and take
the rest of the day off.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.175
Things just got
a little more interesting.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.646
♪ Bo-ba-do-do,
I'm a stuffed animal tree ♪

09:56.805 --> 09:59.729
♪ He's a stuffed
animal tree ♪

10:01.726 --> 10:04.445
(all giggling )

10:04.646 --> 10:06.990
Even my stone skips
are perfect.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.908
Who am I kidding?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.077
Maybe Mabel's right.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.904
It's a horror show
out there.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.081
At least the air here
is breathable.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.867
Dude, you're talking
to a river.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.077
Oh! hey! Wendy.
What's up?

10:19.244 --> 10:21.622
I thought you were busy
wrecking the school or whatever.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.457
Yeah, that got
old quick.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.417
And this music is really starting
to get on my nerves.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.844
I think that stuff you said about
this place is right.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.721
Really? Well, now
we just need a plan.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.882
Don't worry. You always
think of something.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.968
(giggling )

10:37.053 --> 10:41.024
You know, you're so much
smarter than, like, everyone else.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.067
( Chuckles )
It's kinda funny.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.817
If you were older,
you'd be, like, my dream guy.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.022
Wait. Do you
really mean that?

10:48.231 --> 10:49.483
Wait a minute.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.785
In this place, you can be
any age you want.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.613
If we were the same age,
maybe you and me could...

10:54.821 --> 10:56.698
I don't know...
actually be together.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.079
Wait. Really?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.495
I bet if we asked Mabel,
she could do it right now.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.047
In this place, it could finally
be just you and me.

11:04.247 --> 11:07.547
Come on, man.
Just take my hand.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.503
Wait. ( screams )
This isn't real!

11:13.715 --> 11:14.682
( Shrieks )

11:17.302 --> 11:20.932
You shouldn't have
done that, Dipper!

11:21.139 --> 11:22.982
We're watching you.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.857
TOYS: There are
eyes everywhere.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.482
<i>'</i> Hi, Dipper.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.742
Oh! my gosh.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.536
This is crazy.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.535
I'm losing my mind.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.161
We have to get
out of here.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.998
We have to go back...
to the real world!

11:42.160 --> 11:44.629
( Voice echoing )

11:45.955 --> 11:47.582
Hey!

11:47.790 --> 11:50.384
Under Article Smiley Face
of Exhibit Squeaky Duck,

11:50.585 --> 11:52.679
you are hereby accused of
breaking our one rule--

11:52.879 --> 11:54.722
mentioning reality.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.554
(all exclaiming )

11:56.758 --> 12:01.434
Prepare to be banished
from this land forever!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.561
Mabel, you're
smarter than this.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.942
Bill has you hypnotized
or something.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.610
Are you really gonna
let them banish me?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.437
No. Of course not.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.776
That's my brother, guys.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.778
There's gotta be
another way.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.575
Very well.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.619
If Dipper wishes to stay,
he must plead his case

12:16.819 --> 12:21.370
in the ultimate trial
of Fantasy vs. <i>Reality.</i>

12:23.368 --> 12:25.245
Hey. Seriously?

12:25.453 --> 12:28.548
( Muffled chewing )
It was him.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.429
Oh!

12:39.634 --> 12:41.261
( Quacking )

12:41.469 --> 12:42.846
Seriously, Mabel?

12:43.054 --> 12:45.352
You're letting them
take our argument to court?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.354
Hey, I didn't make
the rules of Mabeland.

12:47.558 --> 12:51.153
Yes, you did. There's a tapestry
of you making the rules.

12:51.354 --> 12:55.325
All rise for the Honorable Judge Kitty
Kitty Meow Meow Face Schwartzstein.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.613
- Order, order.
- ( gavel squeaking )

12:59.821 --> 13:02.244
This trial begins
right meow.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.252
Oh! Ha ha!

13:06.452 --> 13:07.419
Ahem. Judge?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.506
Sorry, sorry.
( clears throat )

13:10.707 --> 13:12.675
We are here to try
Dipper Pines

13:12.875 --> 13:17.551
in the case of
<i>Fantasy vs. Reality.</i>

13:17.755 --> 13:19.507
If Dipper wins,
Mabel will return with him

13:19.716 --> 13:21.093
to the real world.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.271
But if he loses,
he will be banished forever,

13:24.470 --> 13:26.518
and replaced with
town darling Dippy Fresh.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.479
Dippy, come on out.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.144
Flip-a-dip-dip.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.447
I hate him so much.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.819
The final decision
will be made by

13:36.024 --> 13:37.742
a jury of your peers.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.326
Hi there.
I love your headband.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.703
Shut your mouth.
I love your headband.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.705
We're all wearing
the same headband.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.536
ALL: Ha ha!
Headband!

13:48.745 --> 13:51.214
Look, Mabel, this whole thing
is ridiculous.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.542
But if winning a trial is what it takes
to get you to come home with us,

13:53.750 --> 13:55.878
then so be it.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.715
I'm sorry, Dipper, but I can only
speak through my legal team now.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.509
We have a doctorate degree
in hunkiness.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.390
Also criminal
and international law.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.517
Let's hear
opening statements.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.101
Your Honor,
townsfolk,

14:08.306 --> 14:09.683
lovely ladies
of the jury.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.564
Oh, he's talking
about us.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.611
That's lovely.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.028
My case is simple.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.529
This very unrighteous dude thinks
that reality is better than fantasy.

14:18.733 --> 14:22.533
But reality is bogus,
lame, and whack.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.739
Objection, Your Honor.
That's conjecture.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.199
Meow-verruled!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.580
I'd like to show you
this "reality"

14:28.785 --> 14:30.207
that Dipper loves so much.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.505
Show you how it has
wronged my client, and Dipper,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.628
their entire lives.

14:34.832 --> 14:35.924
Exhibit "A."

14:36.084 --> 14:38.587
Mabel's scrapbook.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.639
Second grade,
October 10.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.638
Photo day.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.430
( Sniffling )
Darn allergies.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.232
Boom! A million
slap bracelets.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.605
I'm gonna have
the best photo ever.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.814
And how do you like
my new pigtails?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.773
Have fun, brat.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.655
( Gasps )
You ruined my hair!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.657
Dipper, what do I do?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.239
Um, I... well...
I don't...

15:06.447 --> 15:08.324
- ( sobbing )
- Mabel!

15:12.120 --> 15:14.498
Mabel's fantasy was
having a great school photo,

15:14.705 --> 15:17.458
but reality
had other plans.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.214
Look, that was
one bad day.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.298
One of many. February 14,
fourth grade.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.600
- Valentine's Day.
- Oh, come on, man. You can't...

15:27.468 --> 15:29.721
How many Valentines
did you get, Dipper?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.809
Oh, hey,
Dipper didn't get any.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.065
Oh, man, I thought
I was the class loser.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.897
Hey, everyone,
Dipstick didn't get any.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.700
( laughter )

15:44.360 --> 15:47.705
I can't believe
that kid's your brother.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.368
Hey, what's the point
of all this?

15:52.577 --> 15:53.669
That was in the past.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.918
Is your life
any better now, bro?

15:56.080 --> 15:59.926
Heartbreak, disaster,
broken promises.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.677
That's reality for you.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.880
Out there,
it's nothing but heartbreak.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.432
But in here,
who wants pug sundaes?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.226
Hand me a microphone,
Xyler.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.566
Totally
righteous, bro.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.272
- Are we brothers?
- I don't know.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.445
I think we're ready
for a verdict.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.864
Wait! I haven't even
presented my case.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.032
Do you even
have a case?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.528
Yes, I do,
Your Honor.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.866
I call as a witness
Mabel Pines.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.120
(all gasping )

16:32.283 --> 16:33.910
Uh, objection?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.495
I'll allow it.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.546
Us cats are famously
curious, meow meow.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.999
( Spectators murmuring )

16:42.210 --> 16:43.587
Mabel, listen.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.047
I might not have
all the answers.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.179
I'm not stylish,
and I'm not cool,

16:49.383 --> 16:51.511
and I can't make
pugs appear out of thin air.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.847
<i>“</i> B00!
<i>'</i> Guilty!

16:54.055 --> 16:56.558
But I know one thing well,
and that's you,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.147
and I know that even though
you might act like it,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.525
you don't wanna be
in this fantasy world.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.232
Uh... pssshh!
Yeah, right.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.366
You're scared
of growing up.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.069
And who could
blame you?

17:08.277 --> 17:09.779
I'm scared, too.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.580
Uh... la la la la la la la!
I'm not listening.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.082
Guards, the fingers.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.665
Look, real life
stinks sometimes, okay?

17:17.869 --> 17:19.667
I'm not gonna lie.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.874
There's a better way
to get through it than denial,

17:22.040 --> 17:24.464
and that's with help from
people who care about you.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.467
It's how we've gotten
through our whole lives.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.469
Just look.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.267
Mabel, I figured out a way
to fix your photo.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.185
What? You have a wig?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.480
No, but I have a razor.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.651
( laughs )
You're crazy.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.911
We've always been there
for each other.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.919
Mabel, I thought you were
living a fantasy,

18:06.127 --> 18:07.344
but look at me.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.047
I actually thought I was
gonna stay here

18:09.255 --> 18:10.802
and be Ford's apprentice.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.135
Spend my entire teens
cooped up in a basement

18:13.342 --> 18:15.436
with a lab coat.
How ridiculous is that?

18:17.221 --> 18:18.723
I don't know what's
gonna happen in the future,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.933
but whatever it is,
you don't have to fear,

18:21.142 --> 18:23.019
because we'll
do it together.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.279
I'm not taking
Ford's apprenticeship.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.652
We've traveled
to heck and back to get you,

18:27.857 --> 18:29.484
and we're going back
together.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.909
Leave this fantasy world.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.613
Let's beat Bill
and grow up together.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.497
Order. Order in the court!

18:38.701 --> 18:40.920
Dang it, why is this hammer
squeaking?!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.463
You mean it?

18:42.663 --> 18:43.915
You're really
coming home with me?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.424
Yes. Definitely.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.423
Absolutely.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.004
Awkward sibling hug?

18:49.211 --> 18:52.306
- ( Frightened exclamations )
- Don't do it!

18:52.506 --> 18:54.258
You do this,
and it's all over.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.603
Sincere sibling hug.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.348
Don't do the pats!

19:00.556 --> 19:02.684
Pat, pat.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.826
Oh, man.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.700
I never noticed
how bright this place is.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.373
Ugh! Have I actually been
listening to the same song

19:17.573 --> 19:20.122
- for an entire week?
- ( anguished yowl )

19:20.326 --> 19:22.249
Whoa, time to calm you down.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.000
Uh, why isn't
this working?

19:27.208 --> 19:29.882
Because your reign over
this land is over!

19:35.800 --> 19:37.143
We gotta get outta here.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.641
Soos, Wendy,
Paradise is cancelled.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.613
Everyone get on.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.739
Take us to freedom,
Giant Waddles. Yeah!

20:02.660 --> 20:05.630
All right, guys,
are you ready for this?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.082
Sorry, Mabeland.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.509
It's time to burst
your bubble.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.637
Whoa.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.642
You all good?
Everyone good?

20:18.801 --> 20:21.554
- (all laughing )
- We've missed you, Mabel.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.691
Hey, Dipper, I appreciate
what you said back there.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.109
But if you wanna take
Ford's apprenticeship,

20:27.309 --> 20:28.561
I won't get
in your way.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.692
Pfft. Miss out on
your awkward teen years?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.694
You wish.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.535
Man, I went nuts
back there.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.831
I mean, come on, the real
world can't be that bad, right?

20:42.950 --> 20:44.748
Oh, boy-

20:46.704 --> 20:48.502
Where is everyone?
The town's deserted.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.708
Did Bill already win?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.635
Come on, guys. Let's see if we can
go hide out in the shack.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.766
Yes! It's in shambles
just like we left it.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.095
Oh, man, this is the first time I've
ever felt happy going to work.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.896
Hello, house.
Hello, porch.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.519
Hello, wads of gum
I left stuck to the couch.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.605
( Muffled noises )

21:08.809 --> 21:10.607
Wait. What was that?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.688
Sh!

21:17.359 --> 21:19.703
Let's get 'em, dudes.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.998
ALL: Yah!!

21:22.198 --> 21:24.246
( Screaming )

21:24.450 --> 21:26.578
- Stan?
- Kids?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.584
( Toilet flushes )

21:28.788 --> 21:31.462
Just so everyone knows,
we're out of toilet paper.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.418
Did I miss something?

21:37.004 --> 21:39.382
Whoa, we survived.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.718
But where are we?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.518
Are we real?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.307
Is this reality?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.439
Jean-Paul Sartre
postulated that

21:50.601 --> 21:52.478
every existing thing
is born without reason,

21:52.686 --> 21:54.563
prolongs itself
out of weakness,

21:54.772 --> 21:56.274
and dies by chance.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.363
Totally righteous,
bro.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.410
I know!
