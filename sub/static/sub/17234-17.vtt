10:15.931 --> 10:17.458
Just got off the phone with Glenn Goodman,

10:17.459 --> 10:19.714
and Juliette's kicking you off the tour.

10:19.715 --> 10:21.106
Both of you, actually.

10:21.107 --> 10:22.314
Whoa. Hang on.

10:22.315 --> 10:24.378
<i>But your awesome new manager just heard</i>

10:24.379 --> 10:26.242
that someone fell out at
the Franklin theatre tonight.

10:26.243 --> 10:27.435
You're gonna be the main event.

10:27.436 --> 10:29.011
How do you know about my tour?

10:29.012 --> 10:30.299
<i>I haven't heard anything yet.</i>

10:30.300 --> 10:31.498
You will...

10:31.499 --> 10:35.210
as soon as Edgehill finds a way
to give it some positive spin.

10:35.211 --> 10:36.666
[Scoffs] [Chuckles]

10:36.667 --> 10:37.763
Well...

10:38.243 --> 10:41.194
I'm gonna fix this and
save them the trouble.

[Song ends]

10:56.741 --> 10:59.136
You've got three great tracks there.

10:59.821 --> 11:01.055
Yeah.

11:01.056 --> 11:02.031
You really do.

11:02.032 --> 11:03.431
And we're gonna make an amazing album.

11:03.432 --> 11:05.831
Um, I've got my eye on two producers

11:05.832 --> 11:08.152
who I think would be wonderful for this.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.687
'Course, neither one of
them is available right now,

11:10.688 --> 11:12.207
so I'm thinking maybe...

11:12.208 --> 11:14.863
Maybe you go back out
on tour for a little bit,

11:14.864 --> 11:16.343
keep working on the word of mouth.

11:16.344 --> 11:17.264
Oh.

11:17.728 --> 11:19.328
Actually, I, um...

11:20.265 --> 11:22.768
I would rather not go back
out on the road right now.

11:23.768 --> 11:25.871
I really, really want to finish the album.

11:25.872 --> 11:28.159
But I'm not sure I could trust

11:28.160 --> 11:30.335
another stranger to produce it,

11:30.336 --> 11:32.063
after what happened with Liam.

11:32.064 --> 11:33.344
Okay.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.023
Do you have somebody in mind

11:36.024 --> 11:37.655
that you'd like to work with?

11:37.656 --> 11:39.984
Yeah. His name is Avery Barkley.

11:40.504 --> 11:42.070
He, uh, he produced the EP

11:42.071 --> 11:43.520
that Deacon recorded at the Bluebird,

11:43.928 --> 11:45.440
- and he's worked with Juliette Barnes.
- Ohh.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.417
Um, I-I don't know if he'll
do it, but he's very good.

11:48.418 --> 11:50.658
Those are great
credentials. So, talk to him.

11:50.962 --> 11:52.948
You know, see if he's on board.

11:52.949 --> 11:54.735
<i>If he's on board, I'm on board.</i>

11:54.736 --> 11:55.890

Hot off the presses.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.368
Wow!

12:01.369 --> 12:02.553
Thank you!

12:02.554 --> 12:03.943
This is so cool.

12:03.944 --> 12:05.444
[Chuckling] All right.
Can you sign it for me?

12:05.445 --> 12:07.449
[Chuckling] Of course. Yeah. Sure.

12:07.450 --> 12:08.741
- Thanks.
- All right.

12:08.742 --> 12:10.654
Um... Tell you what, though.

12:10.655 --> 12:12.803
You keep, uh, writing songs

12:12.804 --> 12:14.162
like the one you brought me today,

12:14.755 --> 12:16.860
<i>you'll be signing one
for me before too long.</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:17.933
[Chuckles]

12:19.354 --> 12:22.438
Could you, uh, try to
explain that to my dad?

12:22.439 --> 12:23.392
What?

12:23.393 --> 12:24.619
That I'm good at this...

12:25.573 --> 12:28.665
So that maybe he can get off
my back about school a little?

12:28.666 --> 12:30.233
Education is important.

12:30.845 --> 12:32.378
Now you sound just like him.

12:32.379 --> 12:35.111
Well, maybe that's because we
both want what's best for you.

12:35.112 --> 12:37.334
Well, I don't think
taking my guitar away is.

12:37.335 --> 12:39.150
Maybe he's holding on a
little bit tighter right now,

12:39.151 --> 12:40.999
but you got to remember,
he just lost someone...

12:41.362 --> 12:42.668
someone that he loves.

12:44.317 --> 12:45.578
Grief is a tricky thing.

12:45.579 --> 12:47.736
I think maybe you should just give
him a little slack right about now.

12:49.577 --> 12:52.108
"To Maddie, you make
me smile. Love, Deacon."

for the county, and I think
you should head the task force.

13:10.739 --> 13:12.471
Are you using my personal tragedy

13:12.472 --> 13:14.324
to try to spend time with me?

13:14.325 --> 13:15.592
No.

13:15.593 --> 13:18.113
No, I just... I just want
the best person for the job.

13:19.876 --> 13:21.999
Then I will get names of qualified people.

13:22.484 --> 13:24.262
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm quite busy.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.295
Can we just at least
talk about what happened?

13:27.296 --> 13:28.647
It was a mistake.

13:32.631 --> 13:33.868
I'm with Deacon.

13:33.869 --> 13:35.626
And I get that we're
gonna bump into each other

13:35.627 --> 13:37.016
because of Maddie, but...

13:37.842 --> 13:39.359

I signed with Highway 65.

go spreading it around.

to the party with me tonight.

14:18.255 --> 14:19.925

14:19.926 --> 14:21.527
I'm sorry... I can't.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.010
I know you don't care much for Layla,

14:27.011 --> 14:28.924
but I thought you and I
were getting on just fine.

14:29.238 --> 14:32.018
No. It is nothing personal.

it to be a sure thing,

you went to an audition?

the first one that went well.

the others 'cause...

for unless I get a callback.

me longer if they like me.

be selling out arenas,

definitely fill the seats

rather be the star of your own show

Yeah, but you're
forgetting... my deal's 360.

19:29.288 --> 19:30.879
Jeff's gonna have an opinion about this.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.835
I'm, uh... I'm gonna try him again.

19:35.853 --> 19:37.493
You almost ready? We should get going.

19:37.494 --> 19:40.720
Yeah. I just have to do some jewelry.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.180
Here. You want to hold those for me?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.375
- Yes. [Chuckles]
- Thanks, babe.

19:43.376 --> 19:44.558
And then I'll be right with you.

19:45.137 --> 19:48.293
By the way, I heard you laid down
the law with Juliette today...

19:48.294 --> 19:51.254
made her kick will Lexington off her tour.

19:51.255 --> 19:54.407
Well, that was Tandy's brainchild.

19:54.408 --> 19:55.946
Where'd you hear that?

19:55.947 --> 19:57.558
Your good friend Jeff Fordham.

19:57.559 --> 19:59.733
<i>He wants me to take him out on mine.</i>

19:59.734 --> 20:02.044
[Sighs] I swear, Jeff Fordham might as well

20:02.045 --> 20:04.018
just declare war against me.

20:04.019 --> 20:05.568
I don't have to do it, you know.

20:05.569 --> 20:07.291
Well, that's very sweet of you.

20:07.705 --> 20:11.170
But as much as I would love
to screw over Jeff Fordham,

20:11.547 --> 20:14.108
and as much as it kills
me that will bailed on me,

20:14.109 --> 20:16.409
it's not up to me to tell
you what to do with your tour.

20:16.410 --> 20:17.561
Hmm.

20:17.562 --> 20:20.645
I guess that just means
I'm sleeping with the enemy.

20:20.646 --> 20:22.074
- Oh, does it?
- Mnh.

20:22.075 --> 20:24.699
Oh, let's, uh, let's see about that.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.304
[Zipper opens] What are you doing?

20:26.305 --> 20:27.856
- Where's this go?
- I thought we had to go.

20:29.184 --> 20:32.713
You are the guest of honor,
and we can be fashionably late.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.312
Girls! Come on! Let's go!

20:42.366 --> 20:44.734
Okay, wait. Wait. Did...
did you do that to her?

20:44.735 --> 20:46.815
No. She just copies me.

20:46.816 --> 20:49.581
Unh-unh. No. Go back
upstairs and wash your faces.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.053
- Why?
- Why?

20:51.054 --> 20:52.254
Because you're too young for makeup,

20:52.255 --> 20:53.780
and that is way too much for you.

20:54.489 --> 20:56.674
- But, dad...
- No buts. Go.

20:56.675 --> 20:58.230
Dad, it's not like this makeup

20:58.231 --> 20:59.738
is getting in the way of my homework.

20:59.739 --> 21:01.900
You know what? You got to be a better
example for your sister, all right?

21:01.901 --> 21:03.969
How?! By acting like I'm 10?

21:03.970 --> 21:05.843
I'm not a little kid anymore, dad.

21:05.844 --> 21:07.816
Yeah, that's true.
You're right. You're not.

21:07.817 --> 21:09.551
And you're also old enough
to stay home by yourself

21:09.552 --> 21:11.262
while I take your sister to the party.

21:11.263 --> 21:12.340
What?!

21:12.341 --> 21:13.956
Dad, this is mom's big night.

21:13.957 --> 21:15.473
Deacon's gonna be there!

21:15.474 --> 21:17.777
And so will you when you
go clean that up a bit.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.070
Go on.

21:19.683 --> 21:20.919
[Sighs]

21:24.017 --> 21:25.610
Yes, sir. Thank you.

21:27.184 --> 21:28.418
[Cellphone beeps] Who was that?

21:28.907 --> 21:30.215
Bucky Dawes.

21:30.216 --> 21:32.973
With an offer from Rayna
to produce Scarlett's album.

21:34.106 --> 21:36.481
How do Bucky and Rayna
even know who you are?

21:36.819 --> 21:38.843
Uh, Scarlett said she suggested me.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.282
Really?

21:42.283 --> 21:46.070
So, Edgehill can offer you a
deal to produce anybody you want

21:46.071 --> 21:47.713
and that's charity from me,

21:47.714 --> 21:50.402
but if Scarlett does you
a favor, then that's okay?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.879
[Chuckling] This is different.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.491
How? How's...

21:54.492 --> 21:56.476
I turned down my own imprint,

21:56.477 --> 21:58.810
and she's sacrificing what, exactly?

21:58.811 --> 22:00.239
No, she's in a jam.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.175
I mean, this is me helping out a friend.

22:02.176 --> 22:04.121
You have nothing to be jealous about.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.142
Jealous? No, no, no. I'm not jealous.

22:06.143 --> 22:08.041
I'm pissed!

22:09.000 --> 22:11.526
Okay, then instead of
picking a fight with me,

22:11.527 --> 22:12.899
- how about talking to me about it?
- Why?!

22:13.353 --> 22:16.613
Why? So you can say one thing
and do the exact opposite?!

22:16.614 --> 22:19.222
Like, you don't want to ride my coattails,

22:19.223 --> 22:21.679
but you can grab onto
Scarlett's with both hands?

22:21.680 --> 22:23.467
<i>Okay, you know what? Now I'm pissed!</i>

22:23.468 --> 22:24.647
Yeah?

22:24.648 --> 22:26.599
What? You're bailing on the party?

22:26.600 --> 22:27.620
Good! Good!

22:27.621 --> 22:29.304
That's one less person's feelings

22:29.305 --> 22:31.548
I have to tiptoe around all night!

22:39.485 --> 22:41.424
[Cheers and applause]

22:41.982 --> 22:43.826
All right. Don't let
us stop the party, now.

22:43.827 --> 22:45.062
Y'all keep going.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.348
Hey! How are you?

22:47.566 --> 22:48.883
Hi!

- Oh, yeah.

Thought I was gonna have
to get a sleeping bag

23:14.925 --> 23:16.776
and camp out in your office to see you.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.068
[Chuckles] Where's Luke?

24:01.609 --> 24:02.878
I don't know.

24:03.245 --> 24:05.024
Oh, there he is. Come on, Maddie.

- Hi.

Wow. Congratulations on
all this. It's fantastic.

24:13.984 --> 24:14.847
Oh, thanks.

24:15.331 --> 24:17.698
Hey, look, I hate to bring this up tonight,

24:17.699 --> 24:19.211
but I'm having a little
trouble with Maddie.

24:19.575 --> 24:20.867
The only reason she's here tonight

24:20.868 --> 24:22.343
is because this is a big night for you.

24:22.344 --> 24:24.528
But I was eight seconds away
from grounding her earlier.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.285
She's obsessed with the
music, the guitar lessons...

24:26.286 --> 24:28.401
all to the exclusion of everything else.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.763
If you have to draw a
line, I will back you up.

24:30.764 --> 24:32.548
Same here. Thanks.

24:32.549 --> 24:33.768
All right, well, look, enjoy.

24:33.769 --> 24:35.684
And, uh, what time do you want
me to be back to get the girls?

24:35.685 --> 24:37.058
Stay and have a drink, if you want.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.315
Uh...

24:38.889 --> 24:40.807
<i>Yeah, you know what? Maybe I will do that.</i>

24:40.808 --> 24:41.513
- All right.
- All right, have fun.

24:41.514 --> 24:42.530
Okay.

24:42.531 --> 24:45.245
Well, at least I got to
use the front door for once.

24:45.246 --> 24:46.972
[Chuckles] You didn't have to come at all.

24:46.973 --> 24:49.089
Yes, I did. Rayna's right.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.626
I'm done hiding out
from people who hate me.

24:51.627 --> 24:54.764
The only way to win them back
is showing up and making nice.

24:54.765 --> 24:55.851
Understood.

24:55.852 --> 24:58.541
But you don't really seem to be
in the mood to make nice right now.

24:58.542 --> 25:00.568
I think I know how to turn it on.

25:01.278 --> 25:03.047
Hey, y'all! How are you?

25:03.048 --> 25:04.526
- Good to see you.
- Man: Hey, Juliette.

25:04.854 --> 25:06.607
When's the next time you go on tour?

25:06.608 --> 25:08.464
Next week. Why? You want
to come see the show?

25:08.465 --> 25:10.117
Yes. Yes.

25:10.118 --> 25:10.982
Hey, guys.

25:10.983 --> 25:12.090
- Hey!
- Hey, Deacon.

25:12.091 --> 25:13.542
What's up, wheels up? [Laughter]

25:13.543 --> 25:16.906
Hey, if you and Deacon are in
the same city at the same time,

25:16.907 --> 25:18.832
<i>maybe we can go and see both shows.</i>

25:18.833 --> 25:20.174
Wait... you're touring?

25:20.175 --> 25:22.013
Well, I guess you can call it that.

25:22.014 --> 25:24.031
It's a van tour. You remember those.

25:24.032 --> 25:26.081
Hope you don't mind me saying, but, uh,

25:26.503 --> 25:28.603
Deacon Claybourne is too damn good

25:28.604 --> 25:31.650
to be playing bars and sleeping in motels.

25:31.651 --> 25:33.928
Well, I keep telling them all
that, but they don't listen.

25:35.344 --> 25:36.867
Listen, I'm, uh...

25:36.868 --> 25:38.708
I'm retooling my tour a little bit.

25:40.601 --> 25:42.142
Why don't you come open up for me?

25:42.143 --> 25:43.535
Deacon! You have to say yes!

25:43.536 --> 25:45.149
Seriously, say yes!

25:45.150 --> 25:46.896
[Chuckling] Well, I...
I mean, yeah... I w...

25:46.897 --> 25:48.448
I would love to, but I just...

25:48.449 --> 25:49.631
Can you just give me one day?

25:49.632 --> 25:51.934
There's just somebody
I ought to... Run it by.

25:54.283 --> 25:56.429
[Sighs] Could have sworn I
asked you to leave me alone.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.292
You did... but not because
you don't want me around.

25:58.293 --> 25:59.818
<i>It's because you're
scared of how much you do.</i>

25:59.819 --> 26:00.712
[Sighs]

26:00.713 --> 26:02.510
Do you really think you can
go the distance with Deacon?

26:03.362 --> 26:04.458
I mean, let me tell you...

26:04.459 --> 26:06.545
These musicians, they're not normal people.

26:06.546 --> 26:09.108
And he will never understand
your life the way I do.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.707
And what happened between
us was not a mistake.

26:11.708 --> 26:12.700
Please don't.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.627
Only if you can tell me you
haven't been thinking about me

26:14.628 --> 26:16.574
<i>as much as I've been thinking about you.</i>

26:24.643 --> 26:25.577
Hey!

26:25.896 --> 26:27.637
Oh. Got to go.

26:27.638 --> 26:28.868
Girls: Layla!

26:28.869 --> 26:30.286
- Guess what.
- What's up?

26:30.287 --> 26:32.337
Tonight was so awesome
that Brent got Unionmade

26:32.338 --> 26:34.883
to sign on as a sponsor
if we put a tour together.

26:36.379 --> 26:38.163
I talked to Jeff. [Sighs]

26:38.710 --> 26:40.966
Edgehill wants me on Luke Wheeler's tour.

26:41.595 --> 26:42.754
Oh, wow.

26:42.755 --> 26:43.864
I said yes.

26:44.628 --> 26:46.017
What? [Scoffs]

26:46.018 --> 26:47.679
Without even discussing it with me?

26:47.680 --> 26:49.049
Look, I have an opportunity to be on

26:49.050 --> 26:51.884
the biggest tour in America
when my album comes out.

26:51.885 --> 26:53.028
Why would I go on

26:53.029 --> 26:56.121
some little 1,000-seat
tour Brent puts together

26:56.122 --> 26:57.880
when I can be playing stadiums?

26:57.881 --> 26:59.924
Maybe you can get me on Luke's tour, too.

27:00.634 --> 27:02.025
[Groans]

27:02.026 --> 27:05.286
You saw how Jeff reacted
when I promoted your single.

27:05.287 --> 27:06.345
I...

27:09.710 --> 27:11.374
So you're not helping me,

27:11.859 --> 27:13.809
you're not even sleeping with me now,

27:13.810 --> 27:15.861
and you want to go on tour
without talking about it?

27:17.399 --> 27:20.083
Do you even want to be in
this relationship anymore?

27:30.972 --> 27:32.073
- Juliette: Hey.
- Hey!

27:32.825 --> 27:34.456
Didn't expect I was
gonna get to see you here.

27:34.457 --> 27:35.576
Oh, wouldn't miss it.

27:35.577 --> 27:36.680
Marcella.

27:36.681 --> 27:37.864
Jim, how are you?

27:37.865 --> 27:39.617
Didn't realize you were still in Nashville.

27:39.937 --> 27:43.144
Something about you moving to
L.A. because it suits you better?

27:43.145 --> 27:44.128
No. Oh.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.769
I went for a business meeting with Howie V.

27:45.770 --> 27:47.713
He wants to work with
me, but this is my home,

27:47.714 --> 27:49.249
and I'm not going anywhere.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.161
Good thing, too.

27:50.162 --> 27:51.626
We want to keep all our
top talent right here.

27:52.530 --> 27:53.833
So many people.

27:53.834 --> 27:56.261
What did you say you used to
quiz Rayna with, flashcards?

27:56.262 --> 27:57.949
- Golly.
- Hey, y'all, this is my niece...

27:57.950 --> 28:00.309
Scarlett. I've been waiting
to meet you all night.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.228
I'm Marcella Omo from Clear Channel.

28:02.229 --> 28:03.441
Nice to meet you, Marcella.

28:03.785 --> 28:05.480
Jim Perlman, XM radio.

28:05.481 --> 28:07.232
Good to meet you, Jim. Hi.

28:07.233 --> 28:10.824
Rayna went on about you
for 10 minutes earlier.

28:10.825 --> 28:11.720
Oh.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.424
She said that you're one of the best

28:13.425 --> 28:15.872
young singer/songwriters she's ever heard.

28:15.873 --> 28:17.584
Well, I would actually
have to agree with that.

28:17.585 --> 28:18.488
Thank you.

28:18.489 --> 28:21.752
She also said that your debut
album is her next big project?

28:21.753 --> 28:23.792
Yeah, I-I still can't believe my luck,

28:23.793 --> 28:25.080
being taken under her wing.

28:25.081 --> 28:27.096
It's really like I won
the lottery or something.

28:27.097 --> 28:29.088
Looks like you might
have to share her soon.

28:29.089 --> 28:31.592
She says she's getting
close to signing Evan Ryder.

28:31.593 --> 28:33.121
Well, that's great. Evan Ryder...

28:33.122 --> 28:34.774
Seems like she's building
a nice little stable

28:34.775 --> 28:36.534
of honest-to-goodness
country artists over there.

28:36.535 --> 28:38.230
Oh, well, it's a real privilege

28:38.231 --> 28:40.240

do or something? Oh, that's my fault.</i>

28:47.626 --> 28:50.649
She mentioned something about competing
in dressage when y'all were younger,

28:50.650 --> 28:52.296
and we've been jawing
about horses ever since.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.815
Not "y'all"... just that
one. No horses for me.

28:54.816 --> 28:55.751

together for a true legend.

signed me to Highway 65

29:24.007 --> 29:27.630

the next phase of my career.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.922
You have now destroyed any possibility

29:55.923 --> 29:57.611
that we might be able to
use the momentum from that

29:57.612 --> 30:00.211
to salvage your disastrous public image!

wearing a little bit thin

30:09.715 --> 30:12.708
I'm willing to wait for your album, yes,

30:23.689 --> 30:25.832
General consensus is
they love your new song,

I was thinking about
tonight, and I thought,

"well, now, what song
am I gonna play next?"

I've never played before,

38:53.044 --> 38:54.506

artist to sing it with you.
