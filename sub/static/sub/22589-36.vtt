<i>NARRATOR". When we said our last
fearful farewells to Batman and Robin...</i>

00:13.723 --> 00:15.934
<i>...the malevolent Mad Hatter
had trapped them...</i>

00:16.142 --> 00:19.145
<i>...in a fluoroscopic cabinet
of an atomic energy laboratory...</i>

00:19.354 --> 00:21.856
<i>...where, exposed to high-voltage x-rays...</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:25.610
<i>...it would only be a matter of moments
before they'd be radiated forever.</i>

00:25.818 --> 00:28.196
<i>For you, another few hours have gone</i> by...

00:28.404 --> 00:30.865
<i>...for the Dynamic Duo, an eternity...</i>

00:31.074 --> 00:33.409

01:45.565 --> 01:49.277
<i>Horror of horrors,
can it have happened at long, long last?</i>

01:49.485 --> 01:52.447
<i>The disastrous demise
of the Dynamic Duo?</i>

01:52.655 --> 01:54.324
<i>Yesterday, flesh and blood...</i>

01:54.532 --> 01:56.492
<i>...now cowled skeletons.</i>

01:56.701 --> 01:57.994
<i>But who could this be?</i>

01:58.369 --> 01:59.662
<i>The Mad Hatter again?</i>

01:59.871 --> 02:04.626
<i>Demented enough to return
to the scene of his fossilized folly?</i>

02:06.085 --> 02:09.130
Now what's the matter, Polly?
I told you what to expect.

02:09.339 --> 02:10.673
But I didn't expect it.

02:10.882 --> 02:13.718
Why did you bring me here
if you knew about this all the time?

02:13.926 --> 02:17.555
Every man likes a pretty girl with him
at a skeleton dance.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.224
This time, Jervis, you've gone too far.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.268
At least far enough, boss.

02:22.477 --> 02:24.228
There's still ground to be covered.

02:24.437 --> 02:28.691
But with Batman and Robin out of the way,
as I've seen with my own two eyes...

02:28.900 --> 02:31.778
...the rest of this caper should be a picnic.

02:32.278 --> 02:34.530
A picnic? At a time like this?

02:35.114 --> 02:37.950
Let's get out of here
before anybody discovers us.

02:38.159 --> 02:42.038
Although apparently
no one is keeping a death watch.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.464
Hey, boss, you know you could have
picked up another cowl in there.

02:51.673 --> 02:53.174
A morbid thought, Skimmer.

02:53.383 --> 02:58.971
The one I tricked Batman out of last night
will fill the bill beautifully.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.685
No.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.228
I won't believe it.

03:05.436 --> 03:08.356
I don't believe it. I can't believe it.

03:10.525 --> 03:14.028
My world has just been ripped to shreds...

03:14.237 --> 03:16.739
...seam by seam.

03:17.156 --> 03:21.411
Come now, commissioner,
nothing could be as bad as all that.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.122
This is, chief.

03:24.539 --> 03:28.418
A cleaning woman
at the Gotham Atomic Energy Laboratory--

03:28.626 --> 03:30.211
Now, now, easy does it.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.382
--Just called the editor
of the Gotham <i>Post</i> Tribune.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.009
- Maybe if you loosened your tie.
-And told them--

03:37.218 --> 03:39.637
Have you still got that bottle here
in your drawer?

03:39.846 --> 03:42.181
--That she had seen the--

03:43.015 --> 03:45.476
The skeletons...

03:45.810 --> 03:47.687
...of Batman and Robin.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.815
The what?

03:51.691 --> 03:55.403
The skeletons of the Caped Crusaders...

03:55.611 --> 03:58.781
...shrouded in their cowls--

03:58.990 --> 04:00.908
Hold on to me, commissioner.

04:01.117 --> 04:05.371
--In a fluoroscopic cabinet
where they met their maker--

04:05.580 --> 04:07.290
Don't say it.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.168
--Under high-voltage x-ray.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.297
No.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.891
Pennsylvania 6-5-0-0-0.

04:25.475 --> 04:26.809
Oh!

04:27.018 --> 04:32.398
No, no, no.

04:33.065 --> 04:37.195
Well, he's at his ranch right now,
but I'm sure he'll fly to Gotham City right away.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.292
Trafalgar 6-5-0-0-0.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.963
Oh! No, no, no.

04:56.881 --> 04:59.884
She's at Windsor Castle.
She'll fly to Gotham City immediately.

05:05.223 --> 05:09.894
Belatzova 6-5-0-0-0.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.703
- Herr Batman?
-I wanna thank you for your assistance...

05:27.912 --> 05:30.957
...Professor Overbeck.
-Oh, please, don't thank me.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.085
You know, if it weren't
for that little thingamajig...

05:34.669 --> 05:39.423
You mean the Bat X-ray deflector
in my utility belt.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.425
Gosh, yes. Sure a great gadget...

05:41.634 --> 05:44.178
...for deflecting all types of radiation
in an instant.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.764
It never hurts to be prepared, professor.

05:46.973 --> 05:49.141
Oh, and you certainly were.

05:49.350 --> 05:53.855
You know, with that extra cowl you wore
under your contaminated one...

05:54.063 --> 05:57.942
...and the additional wardrobe you had
in your Batmobile. Hmm!

05:58.150 --> 06:01.863
It never would've worked if it hadn't been
for the two skeletons in your closet.

06:03.281 --> 06:06.075
Now I think we should get
to the Batcave. Wait a minute.

06:06.284 --> 06:08.119
Remember, we left the Batmobile in back.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.372
Holy memory bank, you're right.

06:15.626 --> 06:22.300
<i>NARRATOR". But earth-shaking events
or solitary moments, crime marches on.</i>

06:23.593 --> 06:26.387
Look, Jervis,
they're coming down the tank now.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.556
So I see. Ha, ha.

06:28.890 --> 06:33.895
Batman thought he was so smart
planting that tracking gizmo in this cowl.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.397
But now it's planted forever...

06:36.606 --> 06:38.858
...in that tank at the top of the tower.

06:39.066 --> 06:43.905
Oh, the Mad Hatter
has outsmarted the dear departed. Heh.

06:44.238 --> 06:48.117
Jervis, you sound like the Joker
or the Puzzler, or even the Riddler.

06:48.326 --> 06:49.744
Those phonies?

06:50.119 --> 06:53.205
Well, if Batman is so departed...

06:53.414 --> 06:56.417
...why do you go to all the trouble
of hiding the tracking gizmo?

06:56.626 --> 06:59.921
I'm not hiding it, Polly, I'm drowning it.

07:00.129 --> 07:04.967
Now, obviously the Caped Crusader's
little accident will be discovered.

07:05.301 --> 07:08.429
Now, there will be questions asked.
The police will be called in.

07:08.638 --> 07:11.891
I don't want anything to lead them to me.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.102
At least not until I have replaced
the priceless ruby...

07:15.311 --> 07:18.689
...in the Golden Buddha
of Bergama's forehead...

07:18.898 --> 07:23.361
...with this cheap replica
from Hattie Hatfield's headdress.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.363
Cheap replica?

07:25.571 --> 07:29.784
Of course, this is not the real Hatfield ruby.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.869
You mean you knew that all the time?

07:32.078 --> 07:33.329
All the time, Polly.

07:33.537 --> 07:38.376
My entire plan was to find a ruby
similar to one in the Buddha's forehead...

07:38.584 --> 07:41.671
...and then get rid of Batman and Robin.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.756
Now I've succeeded in both.

07:43.965 --> 07:46.258
Now, just as soon as
Benny and Skimmer come in...

07:46.467 --> 07:48.469
...we're off to the Gotham Art Center.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.430
- Why there?
-That's where the Buddha...

07:51.639 --> 07:53.766
...goes on exhibit in one hour.

07:53.975 --> 07:57.019
Now, all we have to do
is overpower the Royal Bergama Guard...

07:57.228 --> 07:59.647
"accompanying the exhibit
on its world tour.

07:59.855 --> 08:03.567
And then with the aid
of my reliable ruby retriever...

08:03.776 --> 08:07.446
...we'll switch rubies,
and we're off and running.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.740
We'd better be off and running right now.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.659
Yeah. Have you been outside recently?

08:11.867 --> 08:13.369
Not since we came in here. Why?

08:13.577 --> 08:16.330
Because everything's come to a dead stop,
that's why.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.041
Someone found those two skeletons.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.419
Well, it was bound to happen
sooner or later.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.505
Well, it happened sooner.
All business is shut down.

08:24.714 --> 08:27.967
The people are flocking to their home
by the thousands.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.302
The whole town's at half-mast.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.264
What a perfect time to snatch the ruby.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.599
Now, Jervis, I'm not so sure that I--

08:35.808 --> 08:37.601
Now, don't go soft on me, Polly.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.272
Who made Batman and Robin
famous crime-fighters?

08:41.480 --> 08:45.985
Criminals, that's who. If you want
to show a little respect to the departed...

08:46.193 --> 08:47.403
...stay crooked.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.196
That's the least you could do.

08:49.405 --> 08:50.740
Sure, boss.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.074
You bet.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.453
I guess you're right, Jervis.

08:56.078 --> 08:58.914
It is sort of like putting flowers
on their graves.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.049
I'm sorry, Mildred.

09:08.257 --> 09:13.929
There are already over 4000 women
on the funeral committee alone.

09:14.138 --> 09:20.102
But I might work you in
on the Statue of Batman Committee.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.814
Good, I'll put your name down.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.234
It's just wonderful
the way the citizens get together...

09:27.443 --> 09:30.946
...when it's a national crisis, isn't it?

09:31.197 --> 09:33.532
Oh, Alfred, how touching.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.493
You're in mourning too.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.788
And you're not even a native citizen.

09:38.996 --> 09:44.668
Now, you two boys
must get black armbands too.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.337
Aunt Harriet...

09:48.506 --> 09:54.095
- Oh. What in the world is that?
-That's what I was coming to tell you, madam.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.555
An immense crowd has gathered outside.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.599
I had to close the gates.

09:58.808 --> 10:04.230
You see, madam, they know that, um,
Mr. Bruce was a friend of Batman's and...

10:04.438 --> 10:06.690
- Yes, yes.
-Well, they're just here.

10:07.024 --> 10:10.653
See that they're served coffee
and sandwiches.

10:10.861 --> 10:15.157
And we'll see them
as soon as we get composed a little more.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.498
Aunt Harriet.

10:22.998 --> 10:27.211
Aunt Harriet, what would your reaction be...

10:27.419 --> 10:32.967
...if I told you that
beyond a shadow of a doubt...

10:33.175 --> 10:39.348
...I knew that Batman and Robin
are still alive?

10:39.682 --> 10:43.435
Well, I just wouldn't believe it, that's all.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.354
What if I told you, Aunt Harriet?

10:45.563 --> 10:51.026
Oh, you two are sweet
to try to bolster my shattered spirits.

10:51.235 --> 10:56.282
But after all, I myself was the one
who telephoned Professor Overbeck...

10:56.490 --> 10:58.450
...at the atomic laboratory.

10:59.118 --> 11:01.120
And he wouldn't lie, would he?

11:01.871 --> 11:07.710
Dick, um, perhaps you and I
should have a moment alone in my study.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.211
I think so, Bruce.

11:09.420 --> 11:13.507
Oh, that's a beautiful way
for you to express your respects.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.600
Hello?

11:22.808 --> 11:24.560
Oh, hello, Esther.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.396
One more try, Dick?

11:27.605 --> 11:29.940
It's the only thing to do, Bruce.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.360
Fifty-thousand people...

11:33.569 --> 11:35.446
...just standing.

11:38.032 --> 11:41.827
The greatest of all the ills of man
is grief, Chief O'Hara.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.670
Mother McGillicutty,
he's calling from the grave.

11:51.879 --> 11:56.300
One thing we do know,
at least Batman isn't buried yet.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.808
Yes?

12:05.142 --> 12:07.686
- Batman?
-Commissioner, I tried to get you earlier.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.773
For as a great man before me has said:

12:11.273 --> 12:14.401
<i>"The rumors of my death
are greatly exaggerated."</i>

12:14.610 --> 12:17.279
It's him, all right, the Caped Crusader.

12:17.488 --> 12:20.241
Returned from beyond the pale,
that's what he's done.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.661
Apparently there's been
a slight error, Batman?

12:23.869 --> 12:28.707
I'll explain, or certainly try, later,
commissioner.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.710
Right now Robin and I are off
to nail Mad Hatter.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.629
Mad Hatter? At a time like this...

12:33.837 --> 12:36.882
...who cares about that pipsqueak's
inconsequential crimes?

12:37.091 --> 12:40.469
Any crime, no matter how large or small,
Commissioner Gordon...

12:40.678 --> 12:43.264
...is a violation of a public right
and common law...

12:43.472 --> 12:47.601
...and the criminal or criminals committing
such an offense must be apprehended...

12:47.810 --> 12:50.145
...for the sake of all human morality.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.148
<i>- You'll hear from</i> me <i>shortly.
-Right.</i>

12:53.357 --> 12:55.109
To the Batpoles.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.615
I guess the first order of business,
Chief O'Hara...

13:01.824 --> 13:04.868
...is getting word to the presidential jet.
-Right.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.872
<i>NARRATOR". But even while the world pulls
out of its tailspin...</i>

13:09.081 --> 13:14.461
<i>...the Mad Hatter's violating public right
and common law.</i>

13:15.879 --> 13:18.465
I told you, the perfect time
for the perfect crime.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.884
Even the Bergama Royal Guards
aren't here.

13:25.139 --> 13:26.890
Boy, that was quick, boss.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.059
But not quick enough, Jervis.

13:29.268 --> 13:33.022
I was down at the hat check stand,
checking no hats, and guess what I heard.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.441
- What?
-Batman and Robin are alive.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.443
How could you have heard that?

13:37.818 --> 13:41.322
I did, and it's spreading like wildfire,
from the president at the airport...

13:41.530 --> 13:43.699
...to the satellite,
to every country on earth.

13:44.366 --> 13:49.038
Wouldn't you know. I reach the peak of my
career and now a petty annoyance like this.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.503
<i>While</i> at the same time...

13:56.712 --> 14:01.508
<i>...Batman and Robin are back
in their familiar haunt.</i>

14:03.010 --> 14:09.099
Mad Hatter has to be someplace
with that contaminated cowl.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.101
Ergo...

14:11.310 --> 14:16.899
Ergo, the small bug I tucked in the cowl
has to be someplace too.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.444
Is that a bleep?

14:22.029 --> 14:26.158
It sounded more like a splash to me, Robin.

14:26.367 --> 14:31.288
Which fits. My little gadget contained
an Underwater Bat-sonar Device.

14:31.497 --> 14:32.664
Holy mermaid.

14:32.873 --> 14:36.627
Now let's see if we can pinpoint
the exact location.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.052
Aha.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.931
A body of water at Spring and Lake Streets.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.516
The old Lake Street reservoir.

14:50.724 --> 14:54.269
Drained, filled,
and turned into a housing project.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.397
The Spring Street Aquarium?

14:56.605 --> 14:58.899
Ran out of fish.

14:59.108 --> 15:00.234
We're not getting far.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.987
But it's a lot better
than being departed and defunct.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.240
Defunct.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.325
I think you may have hit it, old chum.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.869
The defunct Green Derby Restaurant...

15:11.078 --> 15:13.997
...near the intersection
of Spring and Lake Streets.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.667
And if memory serves me correctly...

15:16.875 --> 15:21.046
...there's an old elevated water storage tank
directly behind it.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.594
Yes, commissioner?

15:27.803 --> 15:30.889
We've just learned a ruby was stolen
out of the Golden Buddha...

15:31.098 --> 15:33.058
...on exhibit at the Gotham Art Center...

15:33.267 --> 15:37.104
...and replaced by the one taken
out of Hattie Hatfield's headdress last night...

15:37.312 --> 15:39.189
...which incidentally was fake.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.692
No doubt the Mad Hatter's involved.

15:41.900 --> 15:46.196
But you don't know how relieved I am
to tell you this, Batman.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.283
Relieved?
At the loss of a million-dollar ruby?

15:49.491 --> 15:50.826
<i>No, no, no.</i>

15:51.034 --> 15:54.037
Relieved to know
that you're back on the job.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.622
Thank you, commissioner.

15:55.831 --> 15:59.126
And we'll try to get that ruby back too.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.004
Well, old chum...

16:02.212 --> 16:07.926
...out of the sarcophagus
and back into the saddle.

16:16.101 --> 16:21.315
Gentlemen, uh, would you care
to check your cowls?

16:21.523 --> 16:23.775
We won't be staying that long, miss.

16:23.984 --> 16:28.614
And business doesn't seem
to be exactly thriving.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.117
Well, we shut down immediately
when we heard about Batman and Robin.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.870
A thoughtful gesture.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.332
But a lot of dust sure settled in a short time.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.083
Well, it's this location.

16:40.292 --> 16:44.379
With that, uh, water tower
out back there, it's, uh...

16:44.588 --> 16:46.548
What about that water tower?

16:46.757 --> 16:50.594
Well, it seems to attract a lot of dust.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.638
Let's level, young lady.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.975
Does it not also attract Mad Hatter
and his equally mad henchmen?

16:57.184 --> 17:02.814
And are they not using this defunct restaurant
as a hideout, with you as a pretty decoy?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.233
Where would you ever get an idea like that?

17:05.442 --> 17:07.152
From that cowl...

17:07.736 --> 17:10.531
...which Mad Hatter stole from me last night.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.325
You're Batman?

17:13.534 --> 17:14.910
Holy hoodwink.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.371
Or holy naïveté. Take your choice.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.455
Exactly, Robin.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.376
And when they saw the Batmobile
pull up outside...

17:22.584 --> 17:25.878
...did Mad Hatter and his slippery stooges
head for that water tower...

17:26.088 --> 17:28.089
...whatever the nefarious reasons?

17:28.298 --> 17:30.551
Sure, they're climbing it right now.

17:33.762 --> 17:38.016
That cowl, which Mad Hatter
apparently forgot to decontaminate...

17:38.225 --> 17:40.936
...contains lethal radioactive elements.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.815
He must get medical help at once.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.484
Let's go, Robin.

17:48.485 --> 17:51.822
- May I go with you?
-Yes, you can lead the way.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.501
Look, boss, Polly is leading Batman and Robin
right here, straight to this water tower.

18:13.010 --> 18:15.304
Oh, Jervis isn't gonna like this at all.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.016
Or is he expecting you to play coy...

18:19.224 --> 18:20.767
...then innocent...

18:20.976 --> 18:22.352
...then frightened...

18:22.728 --> 18:24.479
...then lead us to him?

18:24.688 --> 18:27.065
You mean a trap, Batman.

18:27.399 --> 18:32.654
I think we should make this climb
with even more caution than usual.

18:32.863 --> 18:36.950
Robin, stand back.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.290
- They're coming up.
-So what?

18:49.755 --> 18:51.632
When they get to the top of the ladder...

18:51.840 --> 18:56.094
...I'll simply turn on my super-instant
mesmerizing device in my hat, and--

18:58.430 --> 19:00.182
Any other ideas, boss?

19:00.390 --> 19:01.808
Where's the rest of the gang?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.560
Hey, gang-

19:20.035 --> 19:22.954
Sic them. Sic them. Sic them.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.012
Come on, boys!

21:23.533 --> 21:26.036
- Where's the Mad Hatter?
-Up there.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.830
Come down before you die of radioactivity.

21:29.039 --> 21:31.541
At least I'll die with a fortune.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.337
The ruby from the Golden Buddha
of Bergama's forehead is in my pocket...

21:35.545 --> 21:38.298
...and I defy anybody to get it.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.842
And we'll accept that challenge, begorra.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.224
Gosh, Chief O'Hara, are we glad to see you.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.143
Oh, that goes double for me,
Boy Wonder. That in Shamrocks.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.521
We got your call
from the Batmobile, Batman.

21:52.729 --> 21:57.025
But the whole city has gone wild,
celebrating your arising from the grave--

21:57.234 --> 22:01.780
A waste of the citizens' time,
energy and money, Chief O'Hara.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.200
- Where's Commissioner Gordon?
-He caught the girl at the bottom...

22:05.408 --> 22:07.953
...and he's taking her in to book her
as an accessory.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.121
Good. Well, then you can take over here.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.706
Yes, my pleasure.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.215
Holy multitudes.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.136
Well...?

22:25.470 --> 22:27.055
Well...?

22:28.056 --> 22:30.016
After you, old chum.

22:37.941 --> 22:41.987
Now that the tumult and the shouting
have died down...

22:42.195 --> 22:45.699
...and the captains and the kings
have departed...

22:45.907 --> 22:47.617
...I have a question.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.953
- Yes, Aunt Harriet?
-How did you know...

22:50.161 --> 22:54.165
...without a shadow of a doubt
that Batman and Robin were alive...

22:54.374 --> 22:56.751
...when the whole world thought
they were dead?

22:56.960 --> 22:59.754
Yes, well, I, um...

22:59.963 --> 23:01.131
Or you, Dick?

23:01.339 --> 23:03.341
You were equally emphatic.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.678
Well, Aunt Harriet, you see, I, uh...

23:06.887 --> 23:09.347
I know you don't want me
to divulge the secret, sir...

23:09.556 --> 23:12.517
...but I think the time has come
to tell Mrs. Coop--

23:12.726 --> 23:14.519
- No, no, Alfred.
-Yes, sir.

23:14.728 --> 23:18.607
- To tell Mrs. Cooper the truth.
-Alfred.

23:18.982 --> 23:23.361
- It is I who told them, madam.
-You, Alfred? How did you know?

23:23.570 --> 23:26.990
Maudie, the cleaning woman
at the atomic energy laboratory...

23:27.198 --> 23:29.659
...is my cousin Egbert's wife.

23:29.868 --> 23:34.247
And Maudie's always been sadly given
to, shall we say, heh, exaggeration.

23:34.664 --> 23:39.044
But Professor Overbeck himself
substantiated her story.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.297
Just protecting a bewildered
employee, madam.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.799
So that's all it was.

23:45.008 --> 23:48.470
An idle rumor that shook the world.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.723
Well, perhaps it's just as well.

23:51.932 --> 23:56.061
At least Batman and Robin,
wherever they are--

23:56.561 --> 24:00.273
Whoever they are beneath those masks.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.444
--Must know with what esteem
they are held...

24:04.653 --> 24:09.741
...in the hearts of all the people
on this earth.
