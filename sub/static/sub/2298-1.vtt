00:58.893 --> 01:01.604
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.065
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

01:07.318 --> 01:08.570
It's a cake.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.822
I decide what it is.

01:14.284 --> 01:15.952
Looks like some kind of cake.

01:16.661 --> 01:20.832
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

01:57.869 --> 01:59.621
Oh, God.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.422
Boris the Animal...

02:10.048 --> 02:11.466
...you've got a visitor.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.011
It's just Boris.

02:20.975 --> 02:23.853
Your letters have been
a soul-nourishing...

02:24.020 --> 02:24.771
...tonic.

02:26.606 --> 02:29.651
And you are much more...

02:29.817 --> 02:34.364
...unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.125
This ain't a conjugal visit.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.669
So quit your conjugating.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.131
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

02:52.590 --> 02:54.634
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.929
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.765
I'm a romantic like that.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.480
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

03:07.647 --> 03:08.314
Why's that?

03:08.481 --> 03:10.233
It'll ruin your figure.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.530
You complete me.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.425
The big one.

04:22.722 --> 04:24.724
Boris! You promised
to take me with you!

04:24.891 --> 04:25.975
We had a deal!

04:28.352 --> 04:30.354
Obadiah Price.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.151
Yes. I did make you a promise.

04:43.743 --> 04:46.454
Wait. I smell something.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.212
You can't win, Boris.

04:54.504 --> 04:56.172
Let's agree to disagree.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.256
There's too many of us.

04:57.423 --> 05:01.177
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

05:19.779 --> 05:23.074
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.392
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

06:10.079 --> 06:11.038
Good afternoon.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.916
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.711
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical...

06:16.878 --> 06:19.505
...neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

06:19.672 --> 06:20.882
We call it the neuralyser.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.342
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.

06:23.593 --> 06:24.635
Thank you, Agent K.

06:24.802 --> 06:27.096
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

06:30.099 --> 06:33.853
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

06:34.020 --> 06:37.231
You're like, "I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."

06:37.398 --> 06:39.817
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

06:39.984 --> 06:43.195
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and:

06:43.362 --> 06:44.780
Just turn your damn phone off.

06:44.947 --> 06:48.242
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

06:49.619 --> 06:52.455
Check the composition
of the fuel units and surface deposits.

06:52.622 --> 06:53.998
I wanna know who was driving.

06:54.165 --> 06:55.583
Yes, sir.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.960
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Don't worry.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.962
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

07:00.129 --> 07:02.840
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.676
Seriously,
I'm not even sure that's meat.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.180
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.

07:09.347 --> 07:10.848
Thanks, Manny.

07:11.015 --> 07:13.517
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.895
What would go good with this
would be silence.

07:16.062 --> 07:17.229
See, here's the problem.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.564
You can't smell it...

07:18.731 --> 07:21.817
...because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

07:21.984 --> 07:26.030
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

07:26.197 --> 07:28.866
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.409
Let me enjoy this.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.203
Whoa, enjoyment.

07:32.370 --> 07:35.748
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

07:36.916 --> 07:38.125
I keep emotion out of it.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.795
Out of what, K? Life?

07:43.172 --> 07:44.590
You don't wanna run it by me?

07:44.757 --> 07:46.717
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.303
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.889
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.601
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

07:56.519 --> 07:58.854
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.941
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

08:02.108 --> 08:03.526
People will be moved.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.507
And now a few words from Agent K.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.927
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time...

08:30.094 --> 08:31.721
...he never invited me to dinner.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.640
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.895
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.313
Yeah, he was weird.

08:47.403 --> 08:48.738
Thank you.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.951
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.412
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.707
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.

08:59.874 --> 09:03.002
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.

09:03.419 --> 09:07.173
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing...

09:07.339 --> 09:09.592
...she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.802
And I'm paraphrasing.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.453
That's just so Zed.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.663
Thank you.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.344
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

09:53.511 --> 09:57.098
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.308
You know, something like:

09:59.475 --> 10:01.352
"J was a friend.

10:01.519 --> 10:04.522
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

10:04.688 --> 10:08.025
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said...

10:08.192 --> 10:10.444
...except I was too old...

10:10.611 --> 10:12.404
...and craggy and surly...

10:12.571 --> 10:14.865
...and just tight. I was too...

10:15.032 --> 10:16.575
...tight.

10:16.742 --> 10:20.663
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin."

10:20.830 --> 10:22.540
I'll wing something.

10:24.834 --> 10:28.629
<i>K, it's O. We have reports</i>
<i>of several humans suffering from...</i>

10:28.796 --> 10:31.549
<i>...intestinal worms of alien origin.</i>

10:31.715 --> 10:32.758
Thank you, O.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.095
How did you get to be like you?

10:36.262 --> 10:38.055
Something happened, K.
What happened?

10:38.514 --> 10:40.307
You know how I live
such a happy life'?

10:40.850 --> 10:43.352
How you live such a happy life?

10:43.602 --> 10:46.438
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.191
That's deep.

11:00.411 --> 11:01.745
Jeffrey.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.332
Do I know you?

11:05.624 --> 11:10.004
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.839
You were in Lunar-Max.

11:12.006 --> 11:15.593
There is no prison that can hold me.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.138
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

11:19.305 --> 11:20.598
The device.

11:20.931 --> 11:25.352
I'm going back in time to kill a man
before he takes my arm.

11:41.827 --> 11:42.786
K, J!

11:42.995 --> 11:46.540
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

11:54.089 --> 11:55.132
You no hungry?

11:55.299 --> 11:56.383
Show us the tanks, Wu.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.803
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.722
Show us the tanks in the back.

12:02.264 --> 12:05.184
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

12:05.351 --> 12:07.645
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.400
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

12:13.859 --> 12:15.110
You don't have no balls.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.325
Man, you look like
you come from the planet...

12:21.492 --> 12:22.576
...Damn.

12:22.952 --> 12:26.622
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

12:26.789 --> 12:30.167
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...

12:32.628 --> 12:33.754
...food stuffs.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.339
That is an Earth fish.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.008
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...

12:38.175 --> 12:39.218
...that's a hate crime!

12:39.385 --> 12:40.386
It would be...

12:40.552 --> 12:42.137
...if you were Chinese.

12:42.972 --> 12:44.723
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.060
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?

12:48.227 --> 12:49.144
Nobody.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.312
Who's it for?

12:50.479 --> 12:51.480
I keep them in case!

12:51.647 --> 12:53.023
- In case what?
- I don't know!

12:53.190 --> 12:54.108
anybody!

12:54.275 --> 12:55.567
All right, you slug.

12:58.821 --> 12:59.655
Wu...

12:59.822 --> 13:03.409
...he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.285
Thank you, J.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.579
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.374
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.961
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

13:14.128 --> 13:17.673
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.717
Don't nobody want your
nasty-ass noodles.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.593
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

13:21.969 --> 13:22.928
Shrimp and bok choy.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.639
We're gonna be here for a while.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.114
That was just mean.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.700
What you did to Wu back there.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.703
Snatched his skirt off.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.872
That's just disrespectful.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.874
I used to play a game
with my dad:

13:52.041 --> 13:54.752
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

13:55.461 --> 13:57.379
You could do worse than this.

13:59.715 --> 14:00.883
Okay.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.802
I played a game with my dad...

14:03.969 --> 14:05.012
...called catch.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.681
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall...

14:07.848 --> 14:09.183
...because he wasn't there.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.226
Don't badmouth your old man.

14:12.061 --> 14:15.022
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

14:15.731 --> 14:16.732
It's not right.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.942
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.320
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...

14:21.487 --> 14:23.238
...just drank his fourth cup...

14:23.405 --> 14:25.699
...of duck sauce.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.120
<i>K, the crashed ship...</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:31.997
<i>...from this morning</i>
<i>was stolen from...</i>

14:32.164 --> 14:32.831
Lunar-Max.

14:32.998 --> 14:33.957
Boris the Animal.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.167
How did you know?

14:35.334 --> 14:36.794
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.504
<i>Give us a minute, chief.</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:42.383
We're in a situation.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.301
Oh, yeah.

14:45.511 --> 14:46.512
I take the Chloropod.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.805
You take the Tarantabee.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.431
And the Hydronian over there.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.682
I'll take the kitchen.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.476
Meet you on the street.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.436
This is a very confusing time...

14:54.603 --> 14:55.896
...in my life.

15:15.999 --> 15:16.667
Hey.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.892
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.564
Hello, K.

17:05.901 --> 17:06.818
Boris the Animal.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.570
It's just Boris.

17:09.738 --> 17:13.825
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.411
Yes, my arm.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.999
We've thought about that moment...

17:21.290 --> 17:23.710
...every day for the last 40 years.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.921
Well, that's just not living a full life.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.799
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

17:28.966 --> 17:32.678
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.680
We'll see about that.

17:34.846 --> 17:38.600
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.893
Yo, K.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.730
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.002
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.092
You all right?

18:23.604 --> 18:25.522
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

18:29.943 --> 18:30.736
Thank you.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.989
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie...

18:34.156 --> 18:36.742
...from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house...

18:36.908 --> 18:40.370
...so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

18:40.537 --> 18:42.039
Well, this is what happens.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.417
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.301
Man, I am getting too old for this.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.803
I can only imagine how you feel.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.056
Boris the Animal.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.601
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.853
Why? Was he innocent?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.938
Should have killed him.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.109
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.070
- No.
- Leave it alone.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.446
It's above your pay grade.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.365
We have the same pay grade.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.451
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.580
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

19:23.747 --> 19:27.292
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.836
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect...

19:30.003 --> 19:32.005
...that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.509
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.178
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.305
Four weeks.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.557
How about I quit?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.976
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.188
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.157
What up, pops?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.993
- Lose your partner?
- Yeah.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.831
<i>Next shuttle to Afazumba...</i>

20:05.997 --> 20:08.875
<i>...leaving in 22 minutes.</i>

20:21.263 --> 20:21.972
<i>Search...</i>

20:22.139 --> 20:23.140
...Boris the Animal.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.559
<i>Boris the Animal,</i>
<i>Boglodite assassin.</i>

20:25.726 --> 20:27.519
<i>Boglodites were a rogue alien race...</i>

20:27.686 --> 20:29.688
<i>...that consumed all planets</i>
<i>in their path.</i>

20:29.855 --> 20:31.732
<i>Boris the Animal</i>
<i>was the only suspect...</i>

20:31.898 --> 20:34.067
<i>...in a series of alien murders</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

20:34.401 --> 20:35.193
Incident report.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.903
<i>Boris the Animal was convicted...</i>

20:37.070 --> 20:40.907
<i>...for the following murders</i>
<i>that occurred on July 15, 1969</i>

20:41.116 --> 20:45.662
<i>Murder number one: Coney Island,</i>
<i>10:37 a.m. Roman the Fabulist.</i>

20:45.829 --> 20:47.956
<i>Murder number two: The Factory.</i>

20:48.123 --> 20:48.790
Refine search.

20:48.957 --> 20:49.833
Agent K.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.461
<i>Junior Agent K apprehended</i>
<i>and arrested...</i>

20:52.627 --> 20:57.174
<i>...Boris the Animal on July 16,1969,</i>
<i>at Cape Canaveral, Florida.</i>

20:57.340 --> 20:58.759

20:58.925 --> 21:01.386
<i>...received highest commendation</i>
<i>for heroic action...</i>

21:01.553 --> 21:02.888

21:03.054 --> 21:04.723
<i>...of the Arc Net Defense System...</i>

21:04.890 --> 21:07.392
<i>...which protected the Earth</i>
<i>from Boglodite invasion...</i>

21:07.559 --> 21:09.269
<i>...and led to the race's extinction.</i>

21:09.436 --> 21:10.437
Details.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.022
<i>Access restricted.</i>

21:13.190 --> 21:18.487
Excuse me? Clearance level
senior agent, class one. J.

21:18.653 --> 21:19.863
<i>Access denied.</i>

21:20.238 --> 21:21.531
What?

21:36.213 --> 21:40.258
So why this sudden interest
in your partner's old exploits?

21:40.675 --> 21:42.344
What happened between Boris and K?

21:42.511 --> 21:43.428
That's easy.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.639
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.350
He protected the Earth
from the Boglodites.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.101
He did his job.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.938
That's not what I'm asking.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.773
Cape Canaveral, what happened?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.734
Something that changed him.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.028
Leave it at that.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.324
So you two go way back, huh?

22:09.579 --> 22:11.581
That's classified.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.334
A word of advice, Agent J.

22:14.501 --> 22:18.129
Don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.635
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.558
He's a very wise man.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.060
Take the rest of the night off.

22:48.827 --> 22:49.494
What?

22:49.953 --> 22:52.247
Guess I owe you some answers,
hoss.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.416
<i>What, you're feeling chatty</i>
<i>all of a sudden?</i>

22:54.791 --> 22:58.378
I can't talk right now. I've got secret
cases of my own I'm working on.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.797
I hate to tear you away
from your video game.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.883
All right, I'm hanging up.

23:03.133 --> 23:06.511
<i>You know the most destructive force</i>
<i>in the universe?</i>

23:07.804 --> 23:09.139
sugar?

23:09.639 --> 23:11.141
<i>Regret.</i>

23:13.476 --> 23:15.395
You don't have to wait. Just talk.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.189
I promised you the secrets
of the universe. Nothing more.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.359
So there's secrets out there
the universe don't know about?

24:40.021 --> 24:41.147
Mommy.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.958
Can I help you?

25:03.420 --> 25:04.671
K?

25:05.255 --> 25:06.840
5K.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.846
I'm sorry, is that chocolate milk?

25:13.013 --> 25:15.890
Can I...? I'm so sorry.
I don't know what...

25:17.767 --> 25:19.894
Mommy, the president is drinking...

25:20.061 --> 25:22.313
...my milk.

25:23.773 --> 25:24.441
I'm sorry.

25:27.777 --> 25:29.988
He didn't say please.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.463
- Who?

25:46.629 --> 25:47.505
You new?

25:47.672 --> 25:50.341
Very funny, Agent J.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.269
J, everything you told me yesterday,
you were right as rain.

26:01.436 --> 26:04.022
- Thank God for that 10-hour stakeout.
- Who are you?

26:04.189 --> 26:06.900
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.862
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...

26:11.029 --> 26:13.615
...but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my step mom.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.784
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.244
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.455
But I threw a brick
through that window.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.499
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

26:22.665 --> 26:26.336
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

26:28.088 --> 26:30.465
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room...

26:30.632 --> 26:34.177
...then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.055
Who was that?

26:37.222 --> 26:40.141
Double A? Your partner.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.230
I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

26:45.396 --> 26:48.066
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

26:48.233 --> 26:49.776
Did he call in sick or anything?

26:49.943 --> 26:51.402
Who's K?

26:52.362 --> 26:54.823
All right, all right,
go ahead, go ahead.

26:54.989 --> 26:55.740
K!

26:57.033 --> 26:58.159
All right.

26:58.451 --> 26:59.828
You got me.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.247
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.583
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.461
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor...

27:08.628 --> 27:10.338
...but this is a good one.

27:10.505 --> 27:12.340
But I need you
to come out here now...

27:12.507 --> 27:14.926
...because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.387
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down...

27:17.554 --> 27:19.430
...and telling me
who you're looking for?

27:19.597 --> 27:20.723
I'm looking for K.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.559
Who is K?

27:24.644 --> 27:26.020
You too? You too.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.148
I mean, who is he to you?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.440
My partner.

27:29.899 --> 27:32.110
Older gentleman, 110...

27:32.277 --> 27:33.319
...maybe 111 years old.

27:33.486 --> 27:38.449
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

27:39.409 --> 27:40.743
Seen him around?

27:43.246 --> 27:44.747
I'll take you to K.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.749
Thank you.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.550
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.802
He's been dead for over 40 years.

27:58.678 --> 28:02.390
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

28:02.932 --> 28:04.309
It's never been funny.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.984
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.862
<i>Men in Black incident report,</i>
<i>July, 1969.</i>

28:16.029 --> 28:17.197
<i>Location, Cape Canaveral.</i>

28:17.363 --> 28:19.741
<i>Perpetrator Boris the Animal</i>
<i>escaped and fled Earth.</i>

28:19.908 --> 28:23.161
<i>Assumed to have returned to planet</i>
<i>Boglodotia 20 light'-years away.</i>

28:23.328 --> 28:26.664
<i>Agent K pronounced dead at scene.</i>
<i>Awarded posthumous commendation...</i>

28:26.831 --> 28:29.751
<i>...for action which prevented</i>
<i>greater loss of human life.</i>

28:29.918 --> 28:31.419
That's not what happened.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.546
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

28:33.713 --> 28:36.674
- Agent K is dead.
- Well, I just talked to him last night.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.259
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.386
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:40.553 --> 28:44.390
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

28:44.557 --> 28:49.103
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.314
Every morning with his coffee...

28:51.481 --> 28:55.109
...he'd say, "I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

28:55.276 --> 28:57.487
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?

28:57.654 --> 28:59.447
- It was ground this morning."
- "This morning."

28:59.822 --> 29:01.324
How do you know that?

29:01.574 --> 29:02.867
Chocolate milk, sir?

29:03.034 --> 29:06.537
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

29:08.122 --> 29:08.873
Wait.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.918
How long have you been craving
chocolatised dairy products?

29:12.085 --> 29:13.461
Just today.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.256
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

29:16.422 --> 29:17.924
Loss of balance?

29:18.091 --> 29:19.592
Agitation? Depression?

29:19.842 --> 29:20.927
Hell, yeah.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.681
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...

29:24.847 --> 29:26.349
...by a Hovartian brain tick...

29:26.516 --> 29:28.977
...and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.398
Damn it. It's not the tick.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.525
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?

29:35.692 --> 29:37.360
It's something worse than the tick?

29:39.862 --> 29:42.031
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates...

29:42.198 --> 29:44.784
...that you might be involved
in a temporal fracture.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.786
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.372
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.207
What's a temporal fracture?

29:51.374 --> 29:52.375
A break in the time line.

29:52.542 --> 29:53.501
Don't know what you mean.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.503
Time travel! Time travel.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.880
There's no such thing
as time travel.

29:58.256 --> 29:59.716
- Well, there is.
- No.

29:59.882 --> 30:00.967
There's not.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.552
Because if there were...

30:02.844 --> 30:05.722
...a class-one senior agent
such as myself...

30:05.888 --> 30:08.433
...would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

30:08.599 --> 30:11.144
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

30:12.353 --> 30:13.521
You know, I need a raise.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.274
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.485
He figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal...

30:19.944 --> 30:23.197
...throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.117
No... That's where Boris
was locked up.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.371
If Boris worked out
how to time jump...

30:30.538 --> 30:33.249
...he could seriously change
the course of history.

30:34.167 --> 30:36.627
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Early warning system engaged.</i>

30:37.045 --> 30:39.756
<i>Inbound hostile warships</i>
<i>entering solar system.</i>

30:39.922 --> 30:41.966
<i>Boglodite markings</i>
<i>and language detected.</i>

30:42.133 --> 30:45.595
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.055
Apparently not.

30:47.221 --> 30:50.183
<i>Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.</i>

30:50.767 --> 30:52.060
Put up the Arc Net.

30:52.352 --> 30:54.937
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defense system.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.773
K got it for the Boglodites.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.525
There is no K.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.986
He's been dead for over 40 years.

31:02.153 --> 31:05.782
No K. No defense system.

31:06.157 --> 31:07.700
Boris jumped back and killed him.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.787
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

31:11.204 --> 31:13.623
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.292
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.423
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.651
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...

31:41.818 --> 31:42.485
...on batteries.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.279
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

31:45.655 --> 31:47.407
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.659
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.827
He killed my partner.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.371
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.873
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

32:02.046 --> 32:03.464
Target vector, July 16...

32:03.631 --> 32:05.550
- ...1969.
- All right.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.468
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.095
I'm sure he was a great guy.

32:09.262 --> 32:11.305
But in terms of
the space-time continuum...

32:11.472 --> 32:14.100
...your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

32:18.980 --> 32:20.940
That's a big blip.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.152
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me...

32:24.318 --> 32:26.237
...back to July 15th, 1969.

32:26.404 --> 32:29.198
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

32:29.365 --> 32:32.243
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...

32:32.410 --> 32:33.870
...before the older one shows.

32:34.036 --> 32:36.497
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.500
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

32:40.209 --> 32:40.918
No?

32:41.085 --> 32:43.212
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

32:43.379 --> 32:45.882
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...

32:46.048 --> 32:48.134
...New York was like a big-ish city.

32:48.301 --> 32:50.219
So how are you
gonna really find him?

32:50.386 --> 32:54.849
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.185
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

32:57.351 --> 32:59.479
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.897
My man, for real?

33:01.230 --> 33:01.939
Oh, right.

33:02.106 --> 33:03.357
Sorry.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.526
This...

33:05.735 --> 33:08.112
...is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

33:08.321 --> 33:09.989
Very rare, very old.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.325
But first, we gotta get high.

33:12.575 --> 33:13.868
Hey. No.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.704
No. No, I mean, really high.

33:38.518 --> 33:41.604
Hey, man? A little help here?

33:44.524 --> 33:45.650
Thank you.

33:45.816 --> 33:46.692
Okay.

33:47.860 --> 33:50.863
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.824
Okay. You wanna save your partner,
word of advice:

33:53.991 --> 33:55.535
Stay away from him.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.204
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

33:58.371 --> 34:00.206
Now, take these.

34:00.373 --> 34:02.124
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

34:03.376 --> 34:04.502
The way down?

34:04.669 --> 34:07.004
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

34:07.171 --> 34:10.591
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveler, which is cool.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.842
I am not jumping off of this building!

34:13.010 --> 34:14.887
Time jump.

34:16.138 --> 34:16.931
Okay, now...

34:17.098 --> 34:18.891
...I gotta set this thing...

34:19.058 --> 34:20.643
...to the 15th.

34:22.186 --> 34:22.853
That seems...

34:23.020 --> 34:25.022
...right-ish.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.065
Now...

34:27.233 --> 34:29.694
...all you gotta do is jump.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.280
Hey, hey, Stop. Stop it.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.156
When you're moving fast enough...

34:34.322 --> 34:37.868
...that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid...

34:38.034 --> 34:39.786
...and it's gonna glow really bright.

34:39.954 --> 34:42.581
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line...

34:42.748 --> 34:44.708
...with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.918
At this height, that should be...

34:47.085 --> 34:50.005
Let's see, mass of Earth
and 30-something feet per minute...

34:50.172 --> 34:52.632
It's 32 feet per second. Per second.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.760
That sounds right-ish.

34:54.927 --> 34:59.265
So that would be, I guess,
about two feet off the ground.

34:59.432 --> 35:00.725
I break the laser line?

35:00.891 --> 35:01.892
No, don't break it!

35:02.059 --> 35:04.020
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!

35:04.186 --> 35:07.106
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

35:07.273 --> 35:09.275
Do not lose that time device...

35:09.442 --> 35:13.404
...or you will be stuck in 1969!

35:13.571 --> 35:16.407
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.620
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.330
How will I know if it works?

35:22.496 --> 35:24.332
You'll either know...

35:25.291 --> 35:26.834
...or you won't.

35:32.965 --> 35:35.217
You must really love this guy
to do this.

35:35.384 --> 35:38.429
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

35:41.599 --> 35:44.185
- That means you were there!
- I was where?

35:44.393 --> 35:47.313
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.147
Where was I?

35:49.815 --> 35:50.816
You gotta go!

35:51.025 --> 35:51.776
Just go, go, go!

36:16.967 --> 36:18.094
Oh, no!

36:34.985 --> 36:35.820
Come on!

38:10.790 --> 38:13.751
- My man, what's today?
- Tuesday.

38:13.918 --> 38:15.419
- The date?
- The 15th.

38:15.586 --> 38:17.171
- Of?
“July

38:17.338 --> 38:19.465
- Dog, the year.
- 1969.

38:19.632 --> 38:21.258
Thank you.

38:21.634 --> 38:23.886
Look at me like I'm crazy.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.356
Far out.

38:35.523 --> 38:37.983
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.285
Okay, we're here.

38:48.452 --> 38:49.995
- Happy?
- You're such a pill, Fred.

38:53.249 --> 38:55.668
- Get us checked in.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.546
Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

38:58.712 --> 39:00.923
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.

39:01.924 --> 39:04.260
I paid a lot of money
for that luggage.

39:04.426 --> 39:06.971
- We'll take good care-
- Last time, it got scuffed up.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.599
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.227
There's more in the trunk.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.522
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

39:16.689 --> 39:19.608
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?

39:26.782 --> 39:27.908
Let's go!

39:45.551 --> 39:46.969
Far out, man!

39:47.136 --> 39:49.889
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.640
Make love, not war.

39:53.142 --> 39:55.185
I prefer to do both.

40:30.888 --> 40:32.932
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

40:33.098 --> 40:36.185
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.479
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.

40:38.646 --> 40:41.982
Yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.026
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

40:44.276 --> 40:45.486
An individual of your...

40:45.653 --> 40:48.572
...particular ethnic persuasion?

40:50.115 --> 40:52.493
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

40:53.285 --> 40:58.082
Yes. Starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.501
- Where'd you get the car?
- And the suit?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.379
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...

41:03.545 --> 41:05.381
...suit from your grandmother.

41:07.216 --> 41:07.883
Hey.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.885
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

41:10.052 --> 41:11.762
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.931
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.

41:14.098 --> 41:16.392
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer...

41:16.558 --> 41:19.478
...before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

41:19.645 --> 41:20.312
Press it.

41:25.651 --> 41:28.654
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyser.

41:28.821 --> 41:30.280
You're not gonna remember that.

41:30.447 --> 41:33.200
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car...

41:33.367 --> 41:35.661
...does not mean it's stolen.

41:38.497 --> 41:42.209
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.922
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

41:47.089 --> 41:50.676
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.484
Where is the Archanan?

42:07.651 --> 42:08.736
You are too late.

42:08.944 --> 42:11.572
He is going to give the humans...

42:11.739 --> 42:12.406
...the Arc Net.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.535
Let's agree to disagree.

42:47.316 --> 42:48.650
We'll take it from here.

42:49.068 --> 42:50.444
K?

42:52.071 --> 42:54.114
K! K!

43:10.255 --> 43:12.049
Dad, I'm on Earth.

43:12.216 --> 43:13.842
I need bail.

43:23.018 --> 43:26.396
<i>Will the owner of a blue</i>
<i>warp-speed cruiser...</i>

43:26.563 --> 43:28.982
<i>please report to the front desk.</i>

43:31.944 --> 43:36.490
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

43:36.657 --> 43:38.826
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

43:38.992 --> 43:40.119
How do you know my name?

43:42.121 --> 43:44.456
What? Because I called you "K"?

43:45.124 --> 43:46.750
No, I call everybody K.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.669
It's kind of my thing.

43:48.836 --> 43:50.003
What up, K?

43:50.254 --> 43:51.463
All right, I sort of...

43:53.298 --> 43:56.885
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Some people like it.

43:57.052 --> 43:59.179
Most people.

43:59.388 --> 44:00.973
Now that I know what you look like...

44:01.140 --> 44:02.766
...when you're lying, show me...

44:02.933 --> 44:05.310
...what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

44:06.061 --> 44:08.689
I won those at Coney Island
on the ring toss.

44:08.897 --> 44:11.275
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

44:11.567 --> 44:13.318
Must be good, slick.

44:13.652 --> 44:16.196
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

44:16.363 --> 44:18.532
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way...

44:18.699 --> 44:21.326
...is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

44:21.493 --> 44:24.496
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

44:24.663 --> 44:25.581
What's her name?

44:27.124 --> 44:28.417
Your gal, what's her name?

44:29.835 --> 44:31.336
Schtaron.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.215
Schtaron?

44:39.511 --> 44:41.930
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours.

44:42.848 --> 44:44.766
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

44:45.017 --> 44:47.811
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.439
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.

44:50.606 --> 44:54.776
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.445
Thanks for the heads-up.

44:58.030 --> 45:00.824
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

45:00.991 --> 45:03.744
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.

45:04.703 --> 45:05.495
K?

45:09.708 --> 45:11.668
No, I call ladies

45:11.835 --> 45:14.880
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

45:15.047 --> 45:19.551
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

45:19.718 --> 45:22.095
What a mess. Any casualties?

45:22.304 --> 45:24.181
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

45:24.348 --> 45:26.600
Any human casualties?

45:27.226 --> 45:28.894
No, sir.

45:29.895 --> 45:31.188
Who the hell is this?

45:31.605 --> 45:32.773
Look, I was...

45:32.940 --> 45:35.943
- Stray human caught in the net.
- Code 43 him and throw him back.

45:36.109 --> 45:38.195
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

45:38.362 --> 45:40.489
They have a revolutionary new pill.

45:40.656 --> 45:41.823
It's really...

45:43.533 --> 45:44.701
Okay, slick.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.664
I was waiting for my girl.

45:48.830 --> 45:49.873
Schtaron.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.709
Yes, she's Greek.

45:53.919 --> 45:58.215
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.

46:03.595 --> 46:06.431
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyser!

46:06.598 --> 46:09.768
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

46:09.935 --> 46:11.311
I see what you're saying.

46:11.895 --> 46:13.855
You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

46:14.022 --> 46:15.232
K!

46:16.108 --> 46:17.776
Let's get this bite guard in here.

46:17.943 --> 46:19.695
Hey, back up, back up.

46:20.779 --> 46:23.615
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

46:23.782 --> 46:26.118
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

46:26.285 --> 46:27.995
Don't put me in here, K!

46:28.161 --> 46:29.329
Too late, hoss.

46:29.496 --> 46:32.499
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

46:33.458 --> 46:34.793
K!

46:36.128 --> 46:38.338
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

46:38.755 --> 46:40.340
I'll just use my imagination.

46:43.802 --> 46:44.761
K, the killer...

46:44.928 --> 46:47.639
...you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

46:47.806 --> 46:48.849
His name is Boris.

46:49.016 --> 46:50.142
Ship has sailed, amigo.

46:50.309 --> 46:52.060
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

46:52.311 --> 46:54.146
You had my undivided attention.

46:54.313 --> 46:55.439
One will have one arm...

46:55.605 --> 46:57.316
...and one's gonna have two. K!

46:57.482 --> 46:58.817
Listen to me!

46:58.984 --> 46:59.943
If you erase me...

47:00.110 --> 47:01.361
...you erase the world!

47:03.322 --> 47:04.239
<i>Fifteen seconds...</i>

47:04.406 --> 47:06.616
<i>...to neuralysation. Fourteen.</i>

47:07.409 --> 47:09.453
<i>Thirteen. Twelve.</i>

47:09.619 --> 47:12.539
<i>Eleven. Ten. Nine.</i>

47:12.706 --> 47:17.627
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

47:18.003 --> 47:20.839
<i>Four. Three. Two.</i>

47:27.512 --> 47:31.266
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

47:31.767 --> 47:33.769
It's whirring and buzzing.

47:34.603 --> 47:36.897
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

47:40.859 --> 47:42.277
I knew Roman.

47:42.569 --> 47:45.322
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...

47:45.489 --> 47:46.990
...he was my friend.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.160
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

47:55.374 --> 47:56.333
I'm an agent...

47:56.500 --> 47:58.126
...from the future. We're partners.

47:58.293 --> 47:59.961
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...

48:00.128 --> 48:03.215
...and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today...

48:03.382 --> 48:05.384
...escapes from prison,
jumps to the past...

48:05.550 --> 48:09.221
...and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...

48:09.388 --> 48:12.057
...so, really, we need to go right now.

48:20.065 --> 48:20.774
All right.

48:26.488 --> 48:28.240
So that's the story you believe.

48:28.407 --> 48:29.449
That one was the truth.

48:29.616 --> 48:31.701
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

48:31.868 --> 48:34.996
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

48:35.163 --> 48:38.375
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

48:42.337 --> 48:43.922
Agent K.

48:44.506 --> 48:45.799
What's he still doing here?

48:46.007 --> 48:48.802
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

48:48.969 --> 48:50.804
I put my pants on.

48:56.518 --> 48:58.019
Okay, future man, where to?

48:59.521 --> 49:00.605
I don't know.

49:00.772 --> 49:01.773
What do you mean?

49:03.942 --> 49:07.821
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.

49:07.988 --> 49:10.407
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

49:10.615 --> 49:13.994
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

49:14.911 --> 49:18.331
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

49:18.957 --> 49:23.086
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

49:23.253 --> 49:24.296
It's dysfunctional.

49:24.546 --> 49:28.633
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

49:30.093 --> 49:31.344
Man...

49:34.806 --> 49:37.642
There was something in the file
about a factory.

49:37.809 --> 49:39.978
Something happened at a factory.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.817
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

49:45.984 --> 49:47.235
That's all I got.

49:52.574 --> 49:53.658
That spark something?

49:53.867 --> 49:56.536
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

49:59.039 --> 49:59.706
It's a matchbook.

49:59.915 --> 50:01.750
No, it's a clue.

50:01.958 --> 50:03.585
He didn't smoke.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.158
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

50:35.534 --> 50:36.910
No.

50:37.077 --> 50:39.371
Hey, man, how old are you?

50:41.998 --> 50:43.083
Twenty-nine.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.502
You got some city miles on you.

50:46.294 --> 50:49.297
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

50:56.179 --> 50:58.890
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

50:59.349 --> 51:03.019
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

51:03.687 --> 51:05.438
Sure thing, slick.

51:05.605 --> 51:08.024
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in
with you!

51:08.275 --> 51:09.985
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

51:10.151 --> 51:12.320
Wait, no! No!

51:12.487 --> 51:13.280
K!

51:13.446 --> 51:16.157
K, don't go in by yourself!

51:18.827 --> 51:19.703
Hi, fellas.

51:21.997 --> 51:23.373
Need to see the boss.

51:23.707 --> 51:24.874
He's busy.

51:26.042 --> 51:28.086
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.219
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

51:36.386 --> 51:38.346
Looks that way.

51:42.309 --> 51:45.478
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.

51:45.645 --> 51:47.188
Now, where were we?

51:47.355 --> 51:49.232
I was about to tell you to screw off.

51:49.399 --> 51:51.276
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

51:51.443 --> 51:53.612
MiB league champ,
three years running.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.447
Well, let's see it.

51:56.406 --> 51:57.657
You did not walk into my...

51:57.824 --> 51:59.618
...establishment
and rip my head off!

51:59.784 --> 52:03.288
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

52:03.455 --> 52:05.123
I'll tell him this!

52:05.290 --> 52:06.291
All right, your head.

52:06.458 --> 52:10.462
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...

52:10.629 --> 52:11.796
...and make sure you...

52:11.963 --> 52:13.465
...walk funny for the rest...

52:13.632 --> 52:15.717
...of your miserable last days
on Earth!

52:16.801 --> 52:17.802
Tough spare, slick.

52:17.969 --> 52:19.220
You messed with the wrong head!

52:19.387 --> 52:21.556
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us...

52:21.723 --> 52:23.224
...where Dom is?

52:23.391 --> 52:25.685
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

52:28.021 --> 52:30.273
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

52:30.440 --> 52:32.067
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.

52:32.734 --> 52:35.987
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

52:36.154 --> 52:37.447
No cleaning! No cleaning!

52:37.614 --> 52:41.618
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

52:41.785 --> 52:44.371
But he's not gonna talk
to Men in Black scum like you.

52:44.537 --> 52:46.206
Now give me back my head.

52:46.790 --> 52:49.751
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."

52:49.959 --> 52:51.211
That ain't a finger hole...

52:51.378 --> 52:53.088
...you sick bastard!

52:53.254 --> 52:54.422
I'll pop your head off...

52:54.589 --> 52:55.965
...and see how you like it.

52:58.593 --> 52:59.844
I'm gonna kill both of you!

53:00.261 --> 53:02.305
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

53:02.472 --> 53:03.973
I'll kill you both!

53:07.477 --> 53:10.438
- Well, we're on the right track.
- Just the wrong train.

53:10.814 --> 53:12.148
If he had any secrets...

53:12.315 --> 53:13.817
...I'm guessing he spilled them.

53:13.983 --> 53:16.361
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

53:16.528 --> 53:18.029
A smart man would.

53:18.196 --> 53:19.614
That's a big-ass phone.

53:20.156 --> 53:22.867
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.

53:23.034 --> 53:25.453
How's your day been, Agent K?

53:25.620 --> 53:26.746
Fair to middling.

53:26.913 --> 53:27.914
How are things going?

53:28.081 --> 53:29.290
<i>Very good, thank you.</i>

53:29.457 --> 53:31.209
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

53:31.376 --> 53:33.586
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

53:33.753 --> 53:35.672
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

53:35.839 --> 53:38.550
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong...

53:38.717 --> 53:42.345
- ...from the same planetary grouping?
<i>- A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...</i>

53:42.512 --> 53:43.763
...wiped out by Boglodites.

53:43.930 --> 53:45.140
Wasn't the third planet...?

53:45.306 --> 53:47.058
- Glamouria?
- Glamouria.

53:48.727 --> 53:49.811
Thank you, Miss O.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.398
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

53:53.565 --> 53:58.153
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

54:02.031 --> 54:05.076
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him...

54:05.243 --> 54:07.787
- ...I need my gun.
- No deal.

54:09.706 --> 54:11.207
I've been an agent for 14 years.

54:11.374 --> 54:14.919
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...

54:15.086 --> 54:17.130
...but I am instructing
my junior agent...

54:17.297 --> 54:20.216
...that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

54:27.182 --> 54:28.641
No, no, no, space gun.

54:28.808 --> 54:30.226
You're welcome.

54:31.186 --> 54:32.687
I didn't say thank you.

54:38.777 --> 54:41.279
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

54:41.446 --> 54:43.031
I was an agent for three years...

54:43.198 --> 54:45.241
...before I realised
all models were aliens.

54:45.408 --> 54:47.577
Found out the hard way.

54:47.952 --> 54:48.703
Password?

54:48.912 --> 54:51.539
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

54:51.706 --> 54:52.999
Janis Joplin.

55:01.299 --> 55:03.718
Is there anybody here
who's not an alien?

55:09.057 --> 55:10.141
Very nice.

55:10.809 --> 55:11.935
Blink. That's good.

55:12.143 --> 55:13.061
Look in the camera.

55:13.394 --> 55:15.271
Is that Andy Warhol?

55:17.148 --> 55:18.358
Yep.

55:20.401 --> 55:23.613
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

55:23.780 --> 55:26.991
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

55:27.492 --> 55:28.326
Just a few...

55:28.493 --> 55:29.744
...questions.

55:29.911 --> 55:33.081
No questions. No answers.

55:33.248 --> 55:34.874
Just being.

55:35.250 --> 55:37.460
We have an urgent matter
to discuss with you...

55:37.627 --> 55:39.462
...regarding one
of your party guests.

55:40.839 --> 55:42.298
Why don't you come back...

55:42.465 --> 55:44.467
...next week, after the happening...

55:44.634 --> 55:46.427
...has happened.

55:47.303 --> 55:50.431
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

55:50.598 --> 55:51.808
I've got a planet to save.

55:52.725 --> 55:54.394
You're distressing. Everything...

55:54.561 --> 55:56.145
...about you upsets me.

55:59.983 --> 56:02.026
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

56:02.193 --> 56:03.903
Agent W, your cover is safe.

56:04.195 --> 56:05.905
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

56:06.072 --> 56:06.906
Safe?

56:07.073 --> 56:09.075
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...

56:09.242 --> 56:11.452
...I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakes.

56:11.703 --> 56:14.372
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.

56:14.622 --> 56:15.874
Oh, thank you.

56:16.040 --> 56:16.958
Who's the dumb-ass?

56:18.126 --> 56:20.295
How about a little
professional courtesy here?

56:20.461 --> 56:21.754
- Dumb-ass.
- Say it again.

56:21.921 --> 56:23.089
- Want me to?
- I dare you.

56:23.256 --> 56:24.048
Dumb-ass.

56:24.215 --> 56:25.884
- Agents.
- I have no problem...

56:26.050 --> 56:28.386
...pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

56:29.053 --> 56:29.721
What?

56:35.310 --> 56:36.561
Why are you looking at me?

56:39.314 --> 56:41.649
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...

56:41.816 --> 56:44.485
...you see what information
you can get from Agent W...

56:44.652 --> 56:46.863
...and I'll go case the perimeter.

56:47.030 --> 56:48.740
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.

56:48.907 --> 56:50.366
- How about that?
- Oh, cute.

56:50.533 --> 56:52.410
- Okay.
- Very nice.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.996
Someone forget his nap?

57:02.837 --> 57:04.672
Hey, how you doing?

57:05.840 --> 57:07.300
Chilling.

57:12.555 --> 57:13.264
Who's that guy?

57:13.514 --> 57:15.183
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

57:15.350 --> 57:18.937
Actually, he's my old partner.
He travelled back from the future...

57:19.103 --> 57:21.230
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

57:21.397 --> 57:23.191
Andy, Yoko's here.

57:23.358 --> 57:25.234
Yoko's here.

57:26.361 --> 57:30.657
Tell her that I'm filming this man
eating a hamburger.

57:31.199 --> 57:33.409
It's transcendent.

57:33.743 --> 57:35.995
All right, now the pickle.

57:43.336 --> 57:44.754
What are you doing on my turf?

57:45.171 --> 57:46.506
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

57:46.673 --> 57:49.217
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

57:49.384 --> 57:52.428
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

57:52.595 --> 57:54.138
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

57:54.305 --> 57:55.556
Archanans are extinct.

57:55.723 --> 57:58.643
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.

57:58.893 --> 58:01.980
The whole Roswell circuit's
all abuzz about it.

58:02.313 --> 58:04.565
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

58:05.233 --> 58:06.275
His name's Griffin.

58:06.734 --> 58:08.820
<i>Griffin the Archanan.</i>

58:10.571 --> 58:11.614
How's it going?

58:11.781 --> 58:15.243
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

58:15.410 --> 58:16.911
Unless we're in the future...

58:17.078 --> 58:19.414
...where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

58:19.580 --> 58:22.458
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms...

58:22.625 --> 58:24.711
...who dumps the tray
on the sailors on leave.

58:24.877 --> 58:26.129
A shoving match breaks out.

58:26.295 --> 58:29.132
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

58:33.344 --> 58:36.139
Or it's the future where
the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...

58:36.305 --> 58:38.016
...causes me gastric distress.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.810
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries...

58:40.977 --> 58:43.813
...in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.941
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...

58:47.108 --> 58:49.527
...before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids...

58:49.694 --> 58:52.697
...so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

58:54.866 --> 58:56.534
But that depends.

58:58.619 --> 58:59.912
K!

59:00.413 --> 59:01.622
How will we find this guy?

59:01.789 --> 59:03.541
What am I, a schmuck?

59:04.042 --> 59:04.709
He's here?

59:04.876 --> 59:07.920
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

59:08.087 --> 59:10.381
They can live in and visualize
an infinite set...

59:10.548 --> 59:12.759
...of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

59:13.301 --> 59:14.844
Sounds like fun. Good work.

59:15.011 --> 59:16.471
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

59:17.972 --> 59:20.266
You gotta fake my death, okay?

59:20.433 --> 59:22.518
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.

59:22.810 --> 59:25.396
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.690
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

59:27.857 --> 59:29.067
May I see your watch?

59:29.734 --> 59:30.985
Oh, it is 7:18.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.863
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

59:35.740 --> 59:37.825
How do you know
about my father's watch?

59:41.496 --> 59:42.747
Oh, dear.

59:43.164 --> 59:44.874
This is the one
where Roman is dead...

59:45.041 --> 59:47.668
...and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

59:47.835 --> 59:51.297
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

59:52.173 --> 59:53.174
K!

59:53.382 --> 59:54.050
Griffin, right?

59:55.051 --> 59:55.718
We're here...

59:55.885 --> 59:57.011
Because of Boris.

59:57.220 --> 59:58.387
We think he's coming...

59:58.554 --> 01:00:00.139
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:01.349
...unless we're in...

01:00:01.516 --> 01:00:02.975
...the future
where he made the lights...

01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:04.143
...and is about...

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.520
...to shoot from the door...

01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.021
...in which case we're all dead.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.567
Good, that was a close one.

01:00:11.734 --> 01:00:13.152
K, I need a space gun.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.403
The Boglodites...

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:15.988
...consume any planet
in their path.

01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:17.448
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:21.452
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth...

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:23.746
...we can stop them.
They'll starve before...

01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:24.997
...they reach the next planet.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.085
Sixty-three seconds.

01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:30.837
How do we do that? Stop them?

01:00:31.546 --> 01:00:33.214
What?

01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:35.675
Sorry. I have something for you.

01:00:35.842 --> 01:00:38.010
A gift. It can protect you.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:42.223
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again...

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.684
...I'll give it to you.

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:48.521
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:50.356
What do you mean? What miracle?

01:00:50.523 --> 01:00:52.108
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:53.234
No, we got you.

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:55.820
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

01:00:55.987 --> 01:00:57.280
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:58.114
All right.

01:00:58.281 --> 01:00:59.240
We got it, relax.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:01.576
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:04.495
Fly! Find your place in the world!

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.330
Oh, dear.

01:01:06.539 --> 01:01:08.457
Boris is coming through that door...

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:09.333
...in 12...

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.127
...11,10...

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.086
Wait!

01:01:12.253 --> 01:01:13.838
Did you have chocolate milk?

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:15.756
Yes.

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:17.884
Cindy.

01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:20.219
K!

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:21.220
- Griffin!
- Got him.

01:01:30.438 --> 01:01:31.564
Damn it!

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.418
I'm good, I'm good.

01:01:52.585 --> 01:01:53.794
What you got?

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:56.964
Damn it! We had him!

01:01:57.215 --> 01:01:59.091
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.552
First of all, my name is J, okay?

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:04.639
It's not "son," it's not "slick"
and it damn sure ain't no "Cochise."

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.725
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time...

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.477
...and there's an invasion coming.

01:02:09.644 --> 01:02:12.605
You're not really recognizing
my voicial intensity.

01:02:14.232 --> 01:02:16.234
But there was one guy
who could help.

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:18.444
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?

01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:21.280
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:25.493
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no bueno.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.119
We need pie.

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:29.830
- What?
- My granddaddy always said:

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:32.208
"if you got a problem
you can't solve...

01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:34.543
...it helps to get out
of your head." Pie.

01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:36.087
- Pie?
- Yeah.

01:02:36.254 --> 01:02:37.880
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:40.633
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.343
We've been doing smart stuff:

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.679
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.973
It might be time
we do something stupid.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:50.101
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:52.186
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:53.729
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:55.815
Sounds good.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:26.804
Have any specials?

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:30.850
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes...

01:03:31.017 --> 01:03:32.435
...and asks about specials.

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:35.271
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

01:03:35.438 --> 01:03:36.981
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:38.899
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:45.823
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:48.492
What do you do in your spare time,
stretch?

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:53.372
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

01:03:53.539 --> 01:03:55.583
Pie don't work unless you let it.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.126
I'm gonna let it.

01:03:57.293 --> 01:03:58.669
And you say we don't talk?

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:02.214
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:06.093
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:09.930
What's up with you and O?

01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:12.099
Me and O?

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:14.685
Yeah, you and O.

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.187
All right, all right.

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:18.064
All right, this is it.

01:04:19.357 --> 01:04:22.693
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:23.736
Mick Jagger?

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.072
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:27.323
Rings a bell.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:30.785
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

01:04:30.993 --> 01:04:34.205
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

01:04:34.372 --> 01:04:38.334
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.588
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:46.759
Warm beer and the worst food
you ever ate.

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:50.679
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.556
Neither of us wanted to leave.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:04.068
What the hell happened
to you, man?

01:05:04.485 --> 01:05:06.946
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.

01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:11.033
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:12.952
I got you..

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:15.788
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.331
Total losers!

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:19.291
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:22.002
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

01:05:22.336 --> 01:05:25.339
That's funny. The Mets actually
win it all this year.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:26.924
Oh, yeah.

01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:27.967
No, I'm serious.

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:28.843
I'm sure.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:31.554
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there...

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.889
...are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets...

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:36.559
...and the Miracle Mets.

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:40.062
What?

01:05:40.229 --> 01:05:41.897
What you got there, hoss?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:47.361
The Archanan said, "it's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:49.905
I know where he is.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:52.700
Told you to trust the pie.

01:05:57.037 --> 01:06:00.541
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:04.044
He's here. We just gotta find him
before Boris does.

01:06:11.302 --> 01:06:13.220
It's time to give you
your things back...

01:06:13.387 --> 01:06:14.472
...partner.

01:06:14.722 --> 01:06:16.765
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

01:06:16.932 --> 01:06:19.101
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.688
Come on now! All right! Let's go...

01:06:22.855 --> 01:06:23.731
...Mets!

01:06:23.898 --> 01:06:26.400
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:28.777
- ...Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?

01:06:31.489 --> 01:06:32.948
You're just in time!

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:37.453
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.956
Are we missing something?

01:06:41.749 --> 01:06:42.958
The game.

01:07:11.612 --> 01:07:14.823
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.702
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

01:07:19.203 --> 01:07:21.247
This game doesn't happen
till October.

01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:22.748
It's always October...

01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:24.583
...and November and March.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.753
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.713
Until then, they're all happening.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.841
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:36.387
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

01:07:36.554 --> 01:07:39.723
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:41.183
You said you had a gift.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:42.184
That baseball...

01:07:42.351 --> 01:07:46.272
...thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding...

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:49.900
...of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed...

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.403
...due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned...

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.405
...because the tanner's wife
left him...

01:07:54.572 --> 01:07:56.073
...for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.741
The gift?

01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.160
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.

01:08:04.164 --> 01:08:07.001
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:08.043
It's a shield.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:13.424
Shield.

01:08:14.967 --> 01:08:17.511
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.430
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to...

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:20.430
...Davey Johnson...

01:08:20.598 --> 01:08:21.807
<i>...who became a player...</i>

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:25.435
<i>...because his dad couldn't find a</i>
<i>football to give him for his birthday...</i>

01:08:25.603 --> 01:08:26.353
<i>it hits</i>

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.479
<i>...his bat two micrometres</i>
<i>too high...</i>

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:29.982
<i>popping out to Cleon Jones...</i>

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:33.068
<i>...who would've been born Clara,</i>
<i>a statistical...</i>

01:08:33.277 --> 01:08:36.738
<i>...typist, if his parents didn't have</i>
<i>an extra glass of wine that night...</i>

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.782
<i>...before going to bed.</i>

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:40.951
<i>A miracle...</i>

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.621
...is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.506
I lost my planet.

01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:57.091
I don't want you to lose yours.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.761
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off...

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.971
...you'll be my new
favourite moment...

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:03.974
...in human history.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.600
Oh, dear.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.685
I forgot to see this one coming.

01:09:14.777 --> 01:09:15.861
Damn it!

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.206
Have these in the future?

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:28.457
No.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:29.707
Get on.

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:35.464
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:38.216
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the centre stalk...

01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:39.760
...between 80 and 100 psi.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.261
I didn't understand...

01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:42.845
...any of that!

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.099
- Gyro at zero gain.
- It is.

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:47.643
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the centre stalk.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:48.477
I did!

01:09:48.644 --> 01:09:50.604
Between 80 and 100 psi!

01:09:51.647 --> 01:09:52.689
Got it.

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:57.194
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.238
This isn't the one where you get it!

01:09:59.405 --> 01:10:01.490
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.

01:10:01.657 --> 01:10:03.200
It'd be better with four wheels!

01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:04.702
Two is, like, my minimum.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.086
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

01:10:14.253 --> 01:10:16.505
Boglodite invasion,
total destruction of Earth!

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.406
The box!

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:54.877
Good boy.

01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:56.795
We gotta stop this guy!

01:10:59.047 --> 01:10:59.923
I've been trying!

01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:01.467
You haven't been trying?

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:02.676
Hey, slick.

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:06.054
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:07.890
Yes, sir!

01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:34.291
Did you get him?

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:36.084
Give me a sec.

01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:41.381
Is he dead?

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.217
Negative.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.302
He got away.

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:49.598
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:06.448
I feel younger already.

01:12:32.683 --> 01:12:36.103
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:39.565
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:41.608
- Who are you?
- Look at you.

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:44.820
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:46.154
What happened to my arm?

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.574
You lose it, shot off by a human.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.200
No human could defeat me.

01:12:50.576 --> 01:12:54.830
You spend the next 40 years in prison,
chained up like an animal.

01:12:54.997 --> 01:12:56.874
No prison can hold me!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.751
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.879
No human has been to the moon...

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.715
...so they cannot have
built it there already.

01:13:04.882 --> 01:13:07.885
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:11.680
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

01:13:11.847 --> 01:13:14.641
That wasn't me, that was you!

01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:20.898
What's your plan?

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:23.358
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.069
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:27.529
Didn't work.

01:13:27.696 --> 01:13:28.655
With my help...

01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:31.783
...we'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K...

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.244
...the invasion will be successful...

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:35.996
...and we'll get to keep both...

01:13:36.163 --> 01:13:38.540
...of our ar...! Stop...

01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:40.208
...staring at it!

01:13:41.126 --> 01:13:42.210
Listen.

01:13:57.559 --> 01:14:00.812
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:02.022
It's what we do.

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.358
You still have the Arc Net?

01:14:06.568 --> 01:14:08.737
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal...

01:14:08.904 --> 01:14:10.614
...you get good at hiding things.

01:14:36.014 --> 01:14:38.100
This will save your world.

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:43.188
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets...

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:44.648
...a whole lot bigger.

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:47.693
All you have to do is deploy it.

01:14:48.777 --> 01:14:52.197
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:55.033
It's just one small step.

01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:10.590
The moon launch.

01:15:14.052 --> 01:15:15.721
Cape Canaveral.

01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:19.933
July 16th, 1969.

01:15:20.308 --> 01:15:21.893
We got six hours to get to Florida.

01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:23.603
Better get a move on, slick.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:24.855
Wait, hold up.

01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:27.149
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:28.233
He has to be the...

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.276
Griffin.

01:15:29.443 --> 01:15:30.569
What do you mean, alone?

01:15:31.319 --> 01:15:33.196
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

01:15:33.363 --> 01:15:34.614
I need you to trust me.

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:38.785
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

01:15:38.952 --> 01:15:40.412
You're not going to Florida.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:42.330
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:43.874
Look, K...

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:46.710
...please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:49.546
<i>Stop me.</i>

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.178
You die there!

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:02.017
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:05.771
Boris kills you there.

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.733
That's what I'm here for.

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:11.860
That's what I came back to stop.

01:16:12.069 --> 01:16:14.029
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:17.324
K...

01:16:18.075 --> 01:16:20.202
...I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:21.578
I said I told you everything...

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:24.748
That's for lying to me.

01:16:24.998 --> 01:16:26.041
Look, I'm sorry, man!

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:30.837
That's for telling me the truth!

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.007
I'm trying to protect you...

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:36.676
<i>...-man!</i>

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.389
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:46.978
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

01:16:47.145 --> 01:16:49.898
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

01:16:50.065 --> 01:16:51.566
There's no other way.

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.320
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:57.697
Can I save him?

01:16:58.573 --> 01:17:02.369
Is there any future
where I save his life?

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:06.623
Yes.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.377
But where there is death...

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:13.755
...there will always be death.

01:17:31.606 --> 01:17:33.441
According to you,
I've done this before.

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.026
So we know it's possible.

01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:37.154
If you're half the agent
you say you are...

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.614
...you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:45.996
So are we partners? You tell me.

01:17:48.874 --> 01:17:50.458
Let's go.

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:04.472
Agent K...

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:06.057
- ...how are you?
- I'm good.

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:09.394
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:13.773
<i>This morning, man is about to launch</i>
<i>himself on a trip to the moon...</i>

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.443
<i>...with the expectation</i>
<i>of landing there.</i>

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:18.069
Look, I gotta ask you.

01:18:18.236 --> 01:18:20.614
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were...

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.574
...O and I, are we...?

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:23.950
A wise man once told me...

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:26.912
...don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:30.916
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

01:18:35.587 --> 01:18:37.047
Here they are.

01:18:37.923 --> 01:18:40.050
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.

01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:41.760
Jetpacks?

01:18:42.844 --> 01:18:45.597
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:48.099
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

01:18:48.266 --> 01:18:49.267
K, we gotta drive.

01:18:49.684 --> 01:18:52.646
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

01:18:52.938 --> 01:18:56.858
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

01:18:57.025 --> 01:18:58.902
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

01:18:59.069 --> 01:19:00.862
No red buttons yet, slick.

01:19:02.614 --> 01:19:04.741
Come on, man.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:10.664
Do you know...

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.123
...how to work this thing?

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:14.417
It's like with anything.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:18.505
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

01:19:19.631 --> 01:19:20.924
Isn't that right, Miss O?

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.302
Unfortunately, it is.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.773
You ready, slick?

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.193
Let's get it.

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:42.237
This is gonna be interesting!

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:57.460
<i>It's just minutes to the</i>

01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:59.296
<i>...historic launch of Apollo 11...</i>

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.798
<i>with all going well</i>

01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:21.359
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.320
One of the times?

01:20:26.156 --> 01:20:27.699
Oh, we got company.

01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:33.705
The hell?

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:37.250
Is that a battery belt?

01:20:47.135 --> 01:20:48.678
All right, I got it.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:54.434
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed...

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:56.394
...is one where you tell the truth.

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:58.146
The truth?

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.482
The truth is the only path.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:02.359
This is a restricted area!

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.366
Yes, sir, it is.

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:12.494
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.331
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

01:21:16.498 --> 01:21:18.583
We're from a secret government
organization...

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:22.337
...that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

01:21:23.755 --> 01:21:24.881
Here's the thing.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:27.509
We have this special
little metal thingy...

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:31.471
...that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket...

01:21:31.638 --> 01:21:35.266
...to prevent an alien invasion.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:39.646
That worked.

01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:42.524
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.

01:21:42.857 --> 01:21:46.236
Three trespassers. No IDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:48.613
Some kind I've never seen before.

01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:57.914
What breed of fool
do you have to be...

01:21:58.081 --> 01:22:01.000
...to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat...

01:22:01.167 --> 01:22:02.419
...attempted by mankind?

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.505
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own...

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:06.798
- ...firstborn!
- Colonel?

01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:08.842
Colonel, they had these.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:12.178
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket...

01:22:12.345 --> 01:22:13.513
...for an invasion.

01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:18.726
Thanks.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.186
I got 10 minutes to launch.

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:24.482
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:30.905
I told the truth last time.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:37.704
Sir, this man came here from...

01:22:37.912 --> 01:22:39.289
...the future to protect me...

01:22:39.456 --> 01:22:42.876
...so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.003
I need your help to do that.

01:22:48.173 --> 01:22:49.466
Take them to the brig.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.134
You're slipping, Griff.

01:22:51.676 --> 01:22:52.844
Sir, if I may.

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.777
Corporal.

01:23:11.196 --> 01:23:12.530
You men are no longer needed.

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.157
I'll take the prisoners.

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:16.367
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:26.211
Follow me.

01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:35.762
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

01:23:35.929 --> 01:23:38.056
Only what he needed to see.

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:40.767
I have to go now.

01:23:41.893 --> 01:23:43.311
What? No, no, no. Come on.

01:23:43.728 --> 01:23:45.230
You don't need me anymore.

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:48.024
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:51.653
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:53.780
He will not know
you were ever here.

01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:59.577
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:02.997
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

01:24:03.164 --> 01:24:03.831
You coming?

01:24:03.998 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah, all right!

01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:10.421
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

01:24:10.672 --> 01:24:12.465
Anything's possible.

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:16.469
Oh, Griff.

01:24:22.767 --> 01:24:25.270
I can never bear to watch this part.

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:28.856
<i>Armstrong and Aldrin</i>
<i>are scheduled...</i>

01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:30.942
<i>...to set foot on the moon...</i>

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:35.071
<i>...on early Monday morning,</i>
<i>Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:37.198
Where's Griffin?

01:24:37.407 --> 01:24:39.158
Doing his own thing.

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:02.515
Gentlemen.

01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:08.855
This elevator
will take you to the top.

01:25:09.022 --> 01:25:11.024
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere...

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:14.193
...you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.737
You do not want to be...

01:25:15.903 --> 01:25:18.156
...anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

01:25:18.323 --> 01:25:20.700
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.

01:25:20.867 --> 01:25:22.452
Some job you got there.

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:23.870
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

01:25:24.037 --> 01:25:26.539
What did Griff
show you back there?

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.124
How important you are.

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:30.043
You and your partner.

01:25:38.301 --> 01:25:40.720
If everything goes right
the way we hope it does...

01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:43.640
...I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick...

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:47.226
...so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:50.938
If things go wrong,
not gonna have a chance to, either.

01:25:52.899 --> 01:25:54.525
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

01:25:59.072 --> 01:26:00.948
I see why I recruited you.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:04.911
You're a good man.

01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:10.041
Good man.

01:26:12.502 --> 01:26:14.754
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:17.507
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

01:26:22.345 --> 01:26:24.055
I'll take this one!

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.556
Naught)'

01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:30.311
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:42.365
And liftoff.

01:27:23.823 --> 01:27:25.533
<i>Just passed the two-minute mark...</i>

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:29.162
<i>...in the countdown, and all is still go</i>
<i>as we monitor our status board.</i>

01:27:50.475 --> 01:27:53.269
<i>Astronauts report it feels good.</i>
<i>Power transfer is complete.</i>

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:56.981
<i>Neil Armstrong just reported back</i>
<i>it's been a smooth countdown.</i>

01:28:09.577 --> 01:28:10.620
Hey!

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:12.497
Boris, can you give me a hand?

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:14.457
Hey.

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:19.921
Hey!

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.507
You hear me calling you?

01:28:23.382 --> 01:28:24.884
Boris the Animal!

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:26.052
Hey!

01:28:26.219 --> 01:28:28.387
Boris the Animal!

01:28:30.264 --> 01:28:32.642
It's just Boris!

01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:37.522
You're gonna lose.

01:28:37.814 --> 01:28:39.065
Let's agree to disagree.

01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:59.877
Hey!

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.547
Boris the Animal!

01:29:12.515 --> 01:29:13.307
Right.

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:14.809
Left.

01:29:42.879 --> 01:29:43.796
You're gonna lose.

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:46.007
Let's agree to disagree.

01:29:54.891 --> 01:29:56.267
Hey!

01:29:56.976 --> 01:29:58.769
Boris the Animal!

01:30:05.693 --> 01:30:06.402
Right.

01:30:06.777 --> 01:30:08.321
Left. Left.

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:10.156
Right.

01:30:14.243 --> 01:30:16.203
That's not possible.

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:18.414
Let's agree to disagree.

01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:26.797
That's not possible!

01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:37.099
K!

01:30:38.768 --> 01:30:41.103
I win! I'm better than me!

01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:49.779
That's my partner.

01:30:50.237 --> 01:30:52.073
That's my partner!

01:30:58.287 --> 01:30:59.330
If we call this in...

01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:02.166
- ...they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.

01:31:36.867 --> 01:31:38.744
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.

01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:40.413
- How does that work?
- You got me.

01:31:40.579 --> 01:31:41.872
Come on!

01:31:56.721 --> 01:31:57.513
Get down!

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:29.920
Bingo.

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:32.923
Man, that is some next-level stuff.

01:32:42.933 --> 01:32:44.268
You ever want to see more...

01:32:44.477 --> 01:32:47.772
...I know a top-secret organization
that could use a man like you.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:51.358
I wish I could.

01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:52.902
Thank you.

01:32:53.527 --> 01:32:55.404
I'll see you around, K.

01:32:57.156 --> 01:32:57.823
Look out!

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:04.789
Go ahead.

01:33:05.039 --> 01:33:06.791
Arrest me.

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:10.044
Not this time.

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:23.057
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:35.653
Daddy! Daddy!

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:40.533
Hey.

01:33:41.575 --> 01:33:43.536
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

01:33:44.078 --> 01:33:45.121
James.

01:33:45.287 --> 01:33:47.832
James? That's a nice name.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.375
Where's my dad?

01:33:52.253 --> 01:33:54.130
What have you got there?
What is that?

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:55.673
My dad gave it to me.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.092
We timed the launch.

01:34:05.224 --> 01:34:07.017
Where is my daddy?

01:34:11.105 --> 01:34:12.523
He...

01:34:13.107 --> 01:34:16.861
He went to go do something
very special.

01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:18.904
And he wanted me...

01:34:19.071 --> 01:34:23.409
...to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

01:34:28.289 --> 01:34:30.457
When is he gonna be back?

01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:33.002
He...

01:34:47.808 --> 01:34:49.268
James...

01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:52.438
...if you look right here...

01:34:52.605 --> 01:34:55.816
...I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

01:35:01.322 --> 01:35:03.115
Your daddy is a hero.

01:35:03.324 --> 01:35:05.784
My daddy is a hero?

01:35:08.996 --> 01:35:12.291
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.

01:35:21.842 --> 01:35:23.135
James?

01:36:05.511 --> 01:36:07.179
You're late.

01:36:07.346 --> 01:36:09.598
Sorry. Lost track of time.

01:36:11.558 --> 01:36:12.768
How do you know that song?

01:36:13.143 --> 01:36:15.187
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

01:36:16.063 --> 01:36:17.856
What do you know
and what do you don't?

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:19.733
How do I know what I don't know?

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.820
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

01:36:22.987 --> 01:36:23.737
Yeah.

01:36:24.071 --> 01:36:24.947
Boglodites?

01:36:25.114 --> 01:36:25.906
Extinct for 40 years.

01:36:26.323 --> 01:36:28.575
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:29.994
You hung up on me.

01:36:30.411 --> 01:36:32.037
Yeah, I did.

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.249
But that was because
of all those secrets...

01:36:35.791 --> 01:36:38.711
...the universe doesn't know about.

01:36:43.424 --> 01:36:44.216
But...

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:46.385
...I've realised that...

01:36:46.552 --> 01:36:49.054
...last night was a long...

01:36:49.221 --> 01:36:51.515
...long time ago.

01:36:55.769 --> 01:36:58.522
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

01:36:59.106 --> 01:37:01.108
It's been my privilege.

01:37:10.951 --> 01:37:13.370
You know, there's a really
high possibility now...

01:37:13.537 --> 01:37:16.123
...that I might know some things
you don't know.

01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:17.875
I doubt it.

01:37:18.042 --> 01:37:20.002
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

01:37:20.169 --> 01:37:22.087
She's a fine lady,
but you know the rules.

01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:24.423
There's no fraternizing
amongst agents.

01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:27.301
I think y'all might have fraternized
a time or two.

01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:33.807
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

01:37:33.974 --> 01:37:37.227
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

01:37:51.825 --> 01:37:53.702
Almost forgot.

01:38:02.252 --> 01:38:03.962
That was a close one.
