00:02.878 --> 00:04.380
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:04.547 --> 00:07.758
So I'm in my apartment doing
the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle...

00:07.925 --> 00:11.637
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

00:11.804 --> 00:15.683
Three down. "Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

00:15.850 --> 00:19.103
That's me! I'm blank! Hey.

00:19.270 --> 00:23.190
How cool is. We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.317
Yeah, you are, baby.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.819
Three down knows I'm married.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.280
- What's three down doing?
- Sorry.

00:29.447 --> 00:32.116
So do they call you to tell you
your name's gonna be in this?

00:32.283 --> 00:33.743
No. They really liked me there.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.995
They wanted to do a profile on me.
I said no.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.621
Why'd you say no?

00:37.788 --> 00:40.458
Remember what happened
the last time I did an interview?

00:40.624 --> 00:44.086
I said I write a lot of my own lines,
then the writers got mad...

00:44.253 --> 00:46.672
...and made my character fell down
the elevator shaft.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.008
So who knows
what I might say this time?

00:49.175 --> 00:53.345
If only there was something in your head
to control the things you say.

00:53.512 --> 00:57.183
Oh, come on, Joey,
you'll totally keep it in check this time.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.144
And plus, you know, the publicity
would be really good for your career.

01:00.311 --> 01:01.896
And you deserve that.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.482
And if you do the interview,
you could mention...

01:04.647 --> 01:07.526
...oh, I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green.

01:07.693 --> 01:11.072
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

01:12.615 --> 01:14.408
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?

01:15.576 --> 01:16.869
Fine, all right, I'll do it.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.996
But, hey. You guys have to be
at the next table...

01:19.163 --> 01:22.041
...so you can stop me if I,
you know, start to say something stupid.

01:22.416 --> 01:27.129
Just then or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

01:28.047 --> 01:31.634
Come on, we will be there for you
the whole time. Just remember:

01:31.801 --> 01:34.804
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.640
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest.

01:37.807 --> 01:40.935
And not just in the dumb
crossword puzzle.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.146
- Seriously, proud of you.
- Yeah.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.106
I really appreciate you
taking the time to do this.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.441
Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.362
You think we're being obvious?

02:33.529 --> 02:37.950
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

02:38.701 --> 02:41.328
I think it's great
that you wanted to meet here.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.039
When most people hear
that the magazine's paying for it...

02:44.206 --> 02:47.793
...they want a big, fancy restaurant.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.421
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.257
Wouldn't have mattered.

02:53.424 --> 02:56.886
I'm doing this for the fans,
not the free food. Ha, ha.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.555
- Can I get you anything?
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.932
Yeah, and I'll have all the muffins.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.022
- Hey.
- Shh. We're not talking.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.566
Oh, finally. Ugh.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.739
So according to your bio, you've done
quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.700
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

03:22.453 --> 03:25.623
All you want is a dingle

03:25.789 --> 03:28.876
What you envy's a shwang

03:29.043 --> 03:32.463
A thing through which you can tinkle

03:32.630 --> 03:35.299
Or play with, or simply let hang

03:50.314 --> 03:53.567
Folks, this ever happen to you?
You go to the fridge to get a glass of milk...

03:53.734 --> 03:57.112
...but these darn cartons
are so fringing-flanging hard to open.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.323
Boy, you said it, Mike. I don't...

03:59.907 --> 04:01.575
Oh, oh.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.454
- There's gotta be a better way.
- And there is, Kevin.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.414
He's never used this product before.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.000
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.
Go ahead.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.837
- This works in any milk carton.
- Wow, it is easy.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.675
- Now I can have milk every day.
- Ah.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.803
So this is it, Victor?

04:21.428 --> 04:25.933
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

04:27.476 --> 04:30.980
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

04:37.319 --> 04:40.906
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

04:42.574 --> 04:49.081
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.875
But I won't have aged at all.

04:54.962 --> 05:00.050
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.138
Because, Adrian...

05:04.305 --> 05:05.806
. "baby".

05:07.599 --> 05:08.934
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

05:18.027 --> 05:21.780
Shh, shh. Okay, here I come. Here I come.
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

05:21.947 --> 05:25.826
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"

05:27.494 --> 05:32.916
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

05:33.083 --> 05:36.420
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.675
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, wait, wait, you see me again.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.219
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

05:45.054 --> 05:48.182
There I am. There I am. There I am.

05:49.224 --> 05:53.145
Well, there are so many things,
you know, it's hard to pickjust one.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.482
- I'm gonna get some coffee. Want anything?
- Oh, yeah.

05:56.648 --> 06:00.944
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte, extra foam.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.781
- And a bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.410
Okay. How about
when you're not working?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.704
What do you do in your spare time?

06:12.915 --> 06:15.292
Look at this clown.
Just because he's got a bigger boat...

06:15.459 --> 06:17.419
...he thinks he can
take up the whole river.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.297
Get out of the way, jackass!

06:22.049 --> 06:25.052
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

06:27.137 --> 06:29.139
That is the Coast Guard.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.810
What are they doing out here?
The coast is all the way over there.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.397
- Hi.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.858
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.282
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

06:54.289 --> 06:57.334
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.837
Don't you think the cowboy hat
is a little much?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.089
Come on, it's fun.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.635
All right.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.853
Isn't this a woman's hat?

07:16.019 --> 07:18.021
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.235
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.863
I think you're right.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.783
- All right, ready?
- One.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.035
- Two, three.
- Three.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.333
That's kind of nice.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.086
- Yeah, it's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.349
- Free porn! We have free porn here!
- Yeah.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.811
In my spare time,
I, uh, read to the blind.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.397
And I'm also a mento for kids.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.611
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.616
- A mento?
- Right.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.076
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.500
Well, um, another thing that our readers
always want to know...

08:19.666 --> 08:22.586
...is how soap stars
stay in such great shape.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.421
Do you have some kind
of a fitness regime?

08:24.755 --> 08:30.093
Uh, we stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

08:31.053 --> 08:35.097
Wow, you realize we've been throwing
this ball without dropping it for an hour?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.517
Are you serious?

08:36.683 --> 08:39.394
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to say anything...

08:39.561 --> 08:41.855
...because I didn't want to jinx it.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.692
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.694
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

08:47.903 --> 08:51.865
Oh. I think that's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.826
Yeah, I think my pants are a little loose.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.622
What's wrong with you?

08:58.789 --> 09:03.710
Oh, I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.797
And then I, uh, passed out.

09:07.005 --> 09:12.135
I haven't been able to stand up since.
Ha, ha. But I don't think it's serious.

09:12.302 --> 09:15.305
This sounds like a hernia.
You have to... Go to the doctor.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.557
No way.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.600
Look, if I go to the doctor for anything...

09:18.767 --> 09:21.895
...it's gonna be for this thing
sticking out of my stomach.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.526
Why'd I have to start working out again?

09:28.193 --> 09:30.821
Damn you, 15's.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.949
- What is it?
- It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.494
First, there's a layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

09:37.661 --> 09:41.123
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.584
Then raspberries, more ladyfingers...

09:43.750 --> 09:46.003
...then beef sautÃ©ed
with peas and onions.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.589
Then a little bit more custard.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.217
It tastes like feet.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.929
I like it.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.145
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.523
Jam, good. Meat, good.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.987
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.366
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.870
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.831
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

10:22.998 --> 10:24.916
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.962
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.382
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.771
All right, what are we having?

10:49.608 --> 10:55.781
Uh, I don't believe in these crazy diets.
You know, just everything in moderation.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.824
- Your muffins.
- Uh...

10:59.201 --> 11:00.243
I'll take those to go.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.455
For the kids.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.751
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.671
You were on the show years ago
and then they killed you off.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.880
What happened there?

11:12.047 --> 11:13.590
Oh, it's so stupid.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.593
I said some stuff in an interview
that I shouldn't have said.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.012
But believe me,
that is not gonna happen today.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.391
Understood.
So, what did you say back then?

11:22.599 --> 11:23.725
Oh, I said that I...

11:23.892 --> 11:27.229
GROUP
Hey, Joey! How you doing?

11:33.402 --> 11:36.488
You guys, this is Shelly. She's
interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.240
- Hi.
- Shelly, these are my friends.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.242
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.

11:40.409 --> 11:43.370
Um, and if you want the dirt,
I'm the one you come to.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.748
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

11:48.041 --> 11:52.337
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.383
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.720
- I'm gonna go get this warmed up.
- Okay.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.348
- Joey, you're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.600
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.313
So as Joey's friends...

12:10.480 --> 12:12.774
...is there anything you think
our readers ought to know?

12:12.941 --> 12:15.944
Uh, no, just that he is a great guy.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.322
Yeah, that's gonna get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.782
Well, I...

12:20.949 --> 12:23.201
I would just like to say that Joey...

12:23.368 --> 12:27.080
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

12:28.623 --> 12:33.170
Um, I just think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.966
- Oh, I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.177
How do you spell that?
So we can get it right.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.638
Okay, it's P as in Phoebe.
H as in Heebie.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.932
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.270
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate."

12:51.396 --> 12:54.149
Great.
Well, it was nice meeting all of you.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.318
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks, you guys.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.652
Bye.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.739
So it seems like
you have a lot of friends.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.241
- Yeah.
- Who would you say is your best friend?

13:06.328 --> 13:08.288
How come you have two?

13:09.581 --> 13:11.500
Well, this one's for you.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.920
- Get out.
- No, I can't.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.299
No, no. Listen,
I know how much this means to you.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.510
And I also know this is about
more than jewelry.

13:21.676 --> 13:25.514
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

13:27.098 --> 13:31.895
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.606
Check it out. We're bracelet buddies.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.776
That's what they'll call us.

13:39.402 --> 13:43.824
- Oh, Joey. I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.535
No, but look.
Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.

13:46.701 --> 13:50.789
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.917
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.005
- Ha.
- Yeah.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.801
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.971
Whoo! Ha, ha.

14:06.388 --> 14:10.433
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.104
I've been feeling guilty about this.
I wanna be a good friend...

14:14.271 --> 14:17.232
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.859
Yeah, uh...

14:21.987 --> 14:23.321
Wow.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.449
You are a good friend.

14:26.616 --> 14:30.453
Of course, the audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

14:31.204 --> 14:36.376
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

14:38.670 --> 14:42.090
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.136
And they're off. Oh.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.513
Get your foot off my contestant.
Judge.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.433
- Judge rules: No violation.
- Oh.

14:51.975 --> 14:56.229
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter.
- No. Wait, that's not a Nutter Butter.

14:56.396 --> 15:00.442
- That's an old wonton.
- Judge rules: Nutter Butter.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.695
- Oh. Tough call.
- Yeah.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.656
I had seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.993
Wait a minute. I saw that.
On the Discovery Channel.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.038
Yeah, about jellyfish, and how if you...

15:15.707 --> 15:19.127
Ew. You peed on yourself?

15:19.961 --> 15:24.758
- Ew.
- You can't say that. You don't know.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.928
I mean, I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

15:28.094 --> 15:32.807
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.145
O

15:38.772 --> 15:40.649
GROUP
Ew.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.570
That's right, I stepped up.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.867
She's my friend and she needed help.

15:51.409 --> 15:55.038
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.044
Uh, nope. No best friend.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.089
No, just a lot of close friends. Yeah.

16:04.923 --> 16:08.051
So, uh, now back to the show.

16:08.218 --> 16:12.305
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.933
Really? Me?

16:15.100 --> 16:18.061
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.731
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

16:23.525 --> 16:27.153
Now, off the record, you're not...

16:28.405 --> 16:31.241
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

16:32.909 --> 16:36.579
At first, I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too. Check it out.

16:36.746 --> 16:40.750
It's got compartments for all your stuff:
your wallet, your keys, your address book.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.502
Your makeup.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.465
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

16:47.632 --> 16:52.929
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

16:54.139 --> 16:56.683
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face to face.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.770
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.317
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

17:07.569 --> 17:12.906
I'd prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.291
You know, when we talked about
face to face...

17:22.459 --> 17:25.170
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.256
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.218
Check it out.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.429
Huh?

17:37.599 --> 17:40.435
- How much of a man am I?
- Wow.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.397
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.817
You're turning into a woman.

17:48.234 --> 17:52.489
No, I'm not. Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.868
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

17:57.702 --> 18:00.330
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.626
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

18:13.551 --> 18:17.097
- Great nap.
- It really was.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.779
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.533
Uh, but I have a number
of close friends who are.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.162
So let's talk about women.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.250
I'm sure our female readers will be
interested to know about your romantic life.

18:45.416 --> 18:49.295
Oh, what I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

18:49.462 --> 18:53.133
"Hey. How you doing?"

18:55.218 --> 18:56.803
Oh, please.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.973
Hey. How you doing?

19:04.561 --> 19:07.272
Hey. How you doing?

19:07.438 --> 19:10.441
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.695
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.158
Hey, would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

19:24.581 --> 19:27.542
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God. Jill.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.420
- Oh, my God. Rachel.
- Oh, hi.

19:30.587 --> 19:34.674
- Oh, my God. Introduce us.
- Well, this is Chandler.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.467
- Hi.
- You know Monica and Ross.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.970
- Hi.
- And that's Phoebe. And that's Joey.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.930
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.311
You're a really nice guy...

19:46.477 --> 19:49.898
...and I'm happy to be
your roommate and your friend.

19:50.064 --> 19:55.403
I'm just... You know,
I just don't feel that way about you.

19:56.237 --> 20:00.533
Oh, I see what happened. Ha, ha.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.078
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

20:04.245 --> 20:08.541
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.920
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.175
How you doing?

20:19.093 --> 20:20.553
I'm okay.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.349
What? Oh, dear God.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.856
Not much to tell there. I'm really shy.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.195
So that's it. I guess that's all I need.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.696
Thank you so much.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.616
I think they will be running this
in the beginning of next month.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.994
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.121
- Bye.
'Bye-bye.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.917
- I did it.
- Amazing.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.672
Oh, wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

20:55.838 --> 20:59.092
Other than Days of Our Lives,
what's your favorite soap opera?

20:59.259 --> 21:03.763
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

21:06.516 --> 21:09.352
Thank you.
The readers at Soap Opera Digest...

21:09.519 --> 21:10.812
...will be happy to learn that.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.356
Oh. Good enough.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.736
So close.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.202
Wow, I can't believe
they didn't put in the part...

21:26.369 --> 21:28.288
...where you said you didn't
watch soap operas.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.124
Yeah, I called the lady about that.
I told her I was joking.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.583
She was pretty nice about it.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.962
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit. Yeah.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.883
Wow.
This picture of you sure is steamy.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.762
Oh, yeah, that's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.889
Did you just wink at me?

21:47.056 --> 21:49.017
Hey, you're the one
who loves the picture.
