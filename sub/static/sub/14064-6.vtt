WEBVTT

00:10.177 --> 00:12.157
You want to run that by me again?

00:12.679 --> 00:15.176
We have a group of complaining parents.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.636
They're suing their elementary

00:17.636 --> 00:19.227
school over the Halloween pageant.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.173
In particular…

00:21.605 --> 00:23.251
they don't like the witch.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.117
There are two groups of parents who are upset.

00:27.669 --> 00:29.013
One is Christian.

00:29.048 --> 00:30.932
The other group is, uh…

00:32.036 --> 00:32.780
well…

00:34.101 --> 00:35.576
Yes?

00:36.818 --> 00:38.076
Witches.

00:38.347 --> 00:39.631
Did you say witches?

00:39.666 --> 00:41.074
I said witches.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.333
Which group does the firm represent?

00:43.368 --> 00:45.568
Well, actually, both.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.596 --> 00:56.076
Candy corn?

01:30.131 --> 01:31.462
It's just, though they are

01:31.462 --> 01:33.291
together for the purpose of this motion,

01:33.291 --> 01:34.571
they're not so much together.

01:34.571 --> 01:36.075
And I think having two

01:36.110 --> 01:38.553
lawyers, in case there are conflicts.

01:38.588 --> 01:40.961
Yes, and you think the senior partner

01:40.996 --> 01:43.456
of the firm should be doing this because…

01:43.687 --> 01:45.110
It'll be fun.

01:45.145 --> 01:48.712
Plus, you promised I'd get to try cases
with you.

01:56.073 --> 01:58.152
Do you know your briefcase is smoking?

01:58.152 --> 01:59.493
This is the season, Brad.

01:59.493 --> 02:01.871
Bubble, bubble, toil and so forth.

02:01.906 --> 02:03.744
This is a law firm.

02:03.779 --> 02:05.583
Thank you for that.

02:06.667 --> 02:09.592
Mr Shore. My name is Garrett Wells.

02:09.627 --> 02:12.465
Sounds like an old western town, Garrett Wells.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.507
I'm an associate here.

02:13.507 --> 02:16.327
Yes, you're the one who sleeps with paralegals.

02:16.378 --> 02:18.813
–And this is, uh…
–The paralegal.

02:20.848 --> 02:22.201
Can we talk to you for a second?

02:22.201 --> 02:23.517
You are talking.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.466
In private, please?

02:28.522 --> 02:30.983
Let me put this out.

02:34.069 --> 02:37.609
My little brother Jeffrey signed up for
the national guard.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.027
He fulfilled his service contract in Iraq.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.767
He was supposed to come home.

02:41.785 --> 02:45.247
The army kept him there under the stop loss program.

02:45.282 --> 02:47.791
There weren't enough soldiers on the ground

02:47.791 --> 02:51.045
so they put him in a position that he
never trained for.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.481
It got him killed.

02:54.423 --> 02:56.425
I realize as a matter of law that

02:56.508 --> 02:58.399
the army is immune from these suits.

02:58.399 --> 03:00.255
There is probably no way to win this.

03:00.255 --> 03:02.135
That's why we came to you.

03:02.170 --> 03:04.016
You, um, have a high success

03:04.099 --> 03:06.059
rate for unconventional trials.

03:06.094 --> 03:09.574
That's only because the conventional
trials won't have me.

03:10.230 --> 03:13.483
What are you looking to gain from this?

03:14.109 --> 03:16.361
I'm not sure.

03:18.697 --> 03:21.908
I go home and cry every night.

03:21.943 --> 03:25.370
Until I start to scream.

03:26.413 --> 03:28.213
Maybe…

03:28.248 --> 03:32.252
I just want someone to hear my screams.

03:45.473 --> 03:48.268
It promotes a specific religion.

03:48.303 --> 03:50.475
Ah! Shirley Schmidt!

03:50.510 --> 03:52.647
Grace and Bob Mathias.

03:52.682 --> 03:54.520
They're, uh…

03:54.555 --> 03:56.324
The Christians.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.215
And Evelyn and Sam Sawtelle.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.036
–The witches.
–Wiccans.

04:00.071 --> 04:03.116
Sorry. Uh, as I understand it,
the four of you

04:03.151 --> 04:06.161
want to stop the school celebration of Halloween.

04:06.196 --> 04:07.162
It's satanic.

04:07.245 --> 04:08.975
Uh, that's not the position we're taking.

04:08.975 --> 04:11.684
I mean, we're not allowed to have a Christmas concert

04:11.684 --> 04:13.607
because of the whole church and state
thing, but every year…

04:13.607 --> 04:15.659
–At our children's school.
–A public school.

04:15.659 --> 04:16.718
Paid for with our taxes.

04:16.718 --> 04:18.672
They have a Halloween pageant.

04:18.707 --> 04:20.103
It's a pageant, is it?

04:20.137 --> 04:21.599
Where not only are images of

04:21.599 --> 04:22.990
witches prominently displayed

04:22.990 --> 04:24.419
But the principal of the school…

04:24.419 --> 04:25.012
Mrs Berleth…

04:25.012 --> 04:28.953
dresses up like a witch. And she cackles.

04:30.257 --> 04:32.666
–She cackles.
–Bloodcurdling cackles.

04:32.701 --> 04:35.361
We find the whole thing horribly offensive.

04:35.396 --> 04:37.986
Because… Ms Schmidt, as a Wiccan couple,

04:38.021 --> 04:41.043
it's hard enough raising our daughter in this culture

04:41.043 --> 04:44.030
without stereotypical images holding her
up for ridicule.

04:44.030 --> 04:46.146
I mean, I ask you, are we green?

04:46.181 --> 04:48.941
–Do we have warts?
–And as a Christian couple,

04:48.942 --> 04:50.521
we resent having our faith

04:50.556 --> 04:52.704
marginalized while satan worship is openly…

04:52.704 --> 04:54.926
Witches don't worship satan, Grace.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.200
Promoted.

04:56.965 --> 04:58.722
Specifically.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.818
–It's unfair.
–It's defamatory.

05:00.853 --> 05:03.939
You can see, while both couples
are on the same side,

05:03.939 --> 05:05.627
we have competing claims.

05:05.662 --> 05:07.276
But we're putting our differences aside…

05:07.276 --> 05:08.536
For the greater good…

05:19.442 --> 05:22.406
How could they possibly
file papers so thick so fast?

05:22.406 --> 05:25.336
Clearly the government was
ready for this very case.

05:25.336 --> 05:28.277
And just as clearly,
they want to shut it down fast.

05:28.277 --> 05:29.333
So what happens?

05:29.368 --> 05:31.453
Well, instead of responding in kind,

05:31.453 --> 05:34.999
I plan to ask the judge for an evidentiary hearing.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.453
My feeling is, after listening to you, Cassie,

05:37.453 --> 05:39.503
he'll be less inclined to

05:39.587 --> 05:41.532
just summarily dismiss the claim.

05:41.532 --> 05:42.630
Okay.

05:42.665 --> 05:45.665
It also might help if your parents could be there.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.921
Well, my parents aren't with me on this.

05:47.921 --> 05:49.671
They think I'm dishonoring my

05:49.706 --> 05:52.508
brother's memory and his sacrifice.

05:54.011 --> 05:56.145
Okay. We filed in state court

05:56.228 --> 05:58.313
under the state torts claim act,

05:58.355 --> 06:01.900
and miraculously, a judge agreed to hear us.

06:01.935 --> 06:05.445
The bad news is we drew a peculiar judge.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.073
In 26 years on the bench, I have

06:08.157 --> 06:10.742
never seen a case so ridiculous.

06:10.777 --> 06:11.869
It nauseates me.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.336
Your honor is being a little dramatic.

06:14.371 --> 06:17.749
He was a soldier in a war.
What's more, he enlisted.

06:17.833 --> 06:19.668
Private Elliot's tour of duty was

06:19.668 --> 06:21.461
over. He should not have been in Iraq.

06:21.461 --> 06:23.081
He enlisted in part because

06:23.088 --> 06:24.584
he was fraudulently recruited.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.105
Moreover, the army then put him in

06:26.105 --> 06:27.755
a job for which he was not trained

06:27.755 --> 06:29.370
And which resulted in his death.

06:29.370 --> 06:30.454
Move to dismiss.

06:30.489 --> 06:32.461
The United States army
is immune from this sort…

06:32.461 --> 06:34.201
Not to claims based on fraud,

06:34.217 --> 06:35.013
Which this is.

06:35.013 --> 06:36.203
What if the families of every

06:36.203 --> 06:38.807
soldier killed in combat decided to sue?

06:38.842 --> 06:40.308
We'd have a logistical nightmare.

06:40.308 --> 06:41.729
Fortunately, we're only

06:41.764 --> 06:43.582
dealing with one person suing here,

06:43.582 --> 06:45.723
and if you're predisposed to kick it, so be it.

06:45.723 --> 06:47.996
But at least take an hour to hear from

06:47.996 --> 06:50.235
a couple of witnesses before doing so.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.479
You have a legacy of

06:52.514 --> 06:55.530
unfettered fairness, your honor.

06:55.565 --> 06:58.163
Please do not tarnish it.

07:04.170 --> 07:05.956
You pay the court costs.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.486
2 o'clock.

07:10.385 --> 07:12.227
He actually got a hearing?

07:12.262 --> 07:14.848
–Don't ask me how.
–Well, what did he say?

07:14.883 --> 07:17.223
Don't you two have anything else to do?

07:17.767 --> 07:19.172
Um, we're discussing a case, sir.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.512
It's not a case. It's an

07:20.512 --> 07:22.663
abuse of the judicial process.

07:24.566 --> 07:27.626
–Yes, we're discussing that.
–Go shine your shoes.

07:27.661 --> 07:30.613
–I beg your pardon?
–You heard me.

07:30.697 --> 07:32.550
Shine your shoes now.

07:39.747 --> 07:44.585
–And how's your grooming?
–I think fine… sir.

07:44.620 --> 07:47.213
Go to work.

07:49.424 --> 07:51.210
It's fun to pull rank, isn't it?

07:51.210 --> 07:52.392
What you are doing

07:52.427 --> 07:54.637
is an arrogant dismissal of that

07:54.720 --> 07:56.820
young soldier's ultimate sacrifice.

07:56.848 --> 08:00.768
And as somebody who served
in the Gulf war, proudly,

08:00.803 --> 08:03.684
when you disrespect our soldiers,

08:03.719 --> 08:06.566
you disrespect me. I don't like it.

08:16.742 --> 08:18.120
Is it true?

08:19.286 --> 08:21.601
You're criticizing the war?

08:21.636 --> 08:23.916
Constructive criticism.

08:30.506 --> 08:31.086
What?

08:31.121 --> 08:33.866
Alan, I've loved you like a…

08:33.900 --> 08:35.107
Sister.

08:36.312 --> 08:39.481
We're Americans. To be
critical in a time of war.

08:39.515 --> 08:42.591
Even the Democrats are smart

08:42.626 --> 08:43.998
enough to keep their mouth shut on this.

08:43.998 --> 08:45.598
Edward R. Murrow said we should

08:45.598 --> 08:47.478
never confuse dissent with disloyalty.

08:47.478 --> 08:49.672
Edward R. Murrow is media.

08:49.707 --> 08:51.715
And he's dead. Dead don't count.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.700
The dead do count, Denny, which

08:53.735 --> 08:55.835
is why we're bringing this lawsuit.

08:57.616 --> 08:59.373
Drop the case. Do it now.

08:59.952 --> 09:01.572
I'm not dropping it, Denny.

09:03.414 --> 09:04.551
Alan?

09:06.750 --> 09:08.801
I'm senior partner.

09:08.836 --> 09:13.924
I'm asking you, check that,
I'm directing you.

09:13.959 --> 09:17.719
–Drop it.
–No.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.537
I'll boil you whole and

09:33.572 --> 09:36.938
suck the skin from your bones!

09:45.705 --> 09:47.250
Or something like that.

09:50.710 --> 09:54.256
Mr Mathias, is this an accurate depiction

09:54.291 --> 09:56.007
of principal Berleth's

09:56.091 --> 09:59.409
behavior during the Halloween pageant?

09:59.444 --> 10:02.727
Yes, except she does sort of a… swoop.

10:06.364 --> 10:09.039
Could we see the swoop, please?

10:20.615 --> 10:22.539
Uh, your honor, just…

10:23.111 --> 10:24.107
Your honor…

10:25.578 --> 10:27.193
Your honor, the defense

10:27.228 --> 10:29.604
stipulates she's scary as all get out.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.551
Mrs Berleth, you may be seated.

10:33.586 --> 10:37.229
The court thanks you for
the riveting demonstration.

10:42.136 --> 10:44.113
Why is Mrs Berleth's

10:44.148 --> 10:46.217
performance so harmful to your children?

10:46.217 --> 10:48.097
I mean, it's just Halloween.

10:48.132 --> 10:49.942
And that's what we hear daily.

10:49.977 --> 10:52.473
“It's just a movie. ”
“It's just a video game. ”

10:52.473 --> 10:54.451
“It's just the super bowl halftime show. ”

10:54.451 --> 10:56.359
But she's not just a witch to you, is she?

10:56.359 --> 10:58.437
No, and I should be able
to protect my children

10:58.437 --> 11:00.369
from things I deem harmful.

11:00.404 --> 11:02.073
Trying to raise my kids to have

11:02.073 --> 11:03.866
strong Christian values in today's world

11:03.866 --> 11:05.952
is hard enough without
the head of the school

11:05.952 --> 11:08.204
dressing up like a servant of satan.

11:08.287 --> 11:10.414
It's bad enough my 7–year-old
knows all about

11:10.414 --> 11:12.822
bitches, pimps and hos from “grand theft auto”.

11:12.822 --> 11:14.194
Michael Jackson and child

11:14.194 --> 11:16.215
molestation are now words in his vernacular.

11:16.215 --> 11:17.645
My sixth grade daughter has

11:17.645 --> 11:19.345
classmates who will, excuse me,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.975
perform oral sex for a dollar.

11:20.975 --> 11:22.785
Now all of this is learned at school.

11:22.785 --> 11:24.010
This is why we're so livid.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.897
This is why so many of us are homeschooling,

11:25.897 --> 11:27.279
but I don't want to have to do that.

11:27.279 --> 11:31.296
Public school is just that.
It's our school, too.

11:32.577 --> 11:34.458
And satan shouldn't be there.

11:41.203 --> 11:42.403
The national guard said

11:42.403 --> 11:44.530
they'd pay his tuition for college.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.665
He was also told that he'd be safe.

11:47.243 --> 11:48.150
Safe?

11:48.185 --> 11:50.404
He was gonna be a cannon loader,

11:50.439 --> 11:52.623
not one of the guys on the streets.

11:52.706 --> 11:55.084
They promised. When he was reassigned,

11:55.167 --> 11:58.837
doing the job of an MP,
guarding a convoy truck,

11:58.921 --> 12:01.476
he made a joke that he should've just
joined the Boston PD.

12:01.476 --> 12:02.722
If he was gonna travel halfway

12:02.722 --> 12:03.899
around the world to become a cop.

12:03.899 --> 12:07.831
Cassie, what happened
on September 2nd of this year?

12:07.866 --> 12:11.526
Jeff's convoy was pulling through a town
called Iskandariyah.

12:12.463 --> 12:15.053
They nearly ran over an IED.

12:15.088 --> 12:17.518
It's an improvised explosive device.

12:17.553 --> 12:18.051
A bomb.

12:18.086 --> 12:21.206
They had to disarm it
before the convoy could go on.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.774
Jeff didn't have any training

12:23.793 --> 12:25.473
in disarming homemade bombs.

12:25.483 --> 12:28.545
But it had to be done,
and no one else had a clue.

12:29.187 --> 12:31.043
He was always like that.

12:31.078 --> 12:32.710
You know, he…

12:32.745 --> 12:34.785
was always one you could count on.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.582
He just never should have been there!

12:37.582 --> 12:38.651
Okay.

12:38.686 --> 12:41.075
But, Cassie, he did enlist.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.430
You sign up for the military,

12:43.465 --> 12:46.105
you have to assume the risk of going to war.

12:46.677 --> 12:48.091
His tour of duty was up.

12:48.091 --> 12:52.251
Plus he died doing something
he was never trained for.

12:52.286 --> 12:54.801
He didn't assume that risk.

12:59.523 --> 13:01.003
Nothing further.

13:03.818 --> 13:05.243
Mr Randolph?

13:05.278 --> 13:06.905
I have nothing for Ms Elliot

13:06.905 --> 13:08.407
except to thank her family

13:08.407 --> 13:10.272
for the sacrifice that they've made

13:10.272 --> 13:13.571
during this difficult struggle for freedom.

13:34.015 --> 13:35.725
Thank you.

13:36.392 --> 13:39.652
Hi. Did we have a meeting scheduled?

13:39.687 --> 13:42.690
Denise, we have
some concerns about our case.

13:42.725 --> 13:45.944
Okay. Well, please.

13:48.029 --> 13:49.322
We don't want to make trouble,

13:49.322 --> 13:51.723
but the Christians keep bringing up satanism,

13:51.723 --> 13:53.248
which completely misrepresents

13:53.248 --> 13:54.536
what our religion is about.

13:54.536 --> 13:55.754
We're worried that the Wiccan

13:55.754 --> 13:57.892
side isn't being represented fairly,

13:57.892 --> 13:59.961
I mean, we're a recognized religion

13:59.961 --> 14:03.093
with hundreds of thousands of followers.

14:03.128 --> 14:04.673
We're just looking for balance.

14:04.673 --> 14:06.148
Well, your side is up next,

14:06.148 --> 14:09.028
and you'll be able
to state your position fully.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.747
I promise.

14:10.782 --> 14:14.119
Thank you. That's all we ask.

14:14.154 --> 14:14.828
Yeah.

14:19.477 --> 14:20.917
Should we say something?

14:21.456 --> 14:22.593
What?

14:22.628 --> 14:27.276
–Um, Denise…
–Uh, we don't know you very well.

14:27.311 --> 14:30.911
Wiccans care about spreading goodwill

14:30.946 --> 14:34.427
and restoring the natural
balance of the world.

14:34.462 --> 14:36.839
And from you, well, we're feeling

14:36.874 --> 14:39.217
a quiet, screaming disharmony.

14:41.048 --> 14:41.748
Come again?

14:41.783 --> 14:45.563
Maybe it has to do with the fact that
you're recently divorced.

14:46.245 --> 14:47.377
How did you know that?

14:47.377 --> 14:50.849
You have a tan line from your ring.

14:53.010 --> 14:55.144
We can help. It's what we do.

14:55.179 --> 14:59.850
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm completely…

14:59.885 --> 15:01.797
harmonic.

15:02.019 --> 15:04.173
–Okay.
–Okay.

15:15.908 --> 15:17.764
This case is going great.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.585
You did excellent today.

15:19.620 --> 15:23.707
Yeah, whatever that means. It's…

15:23.742 --> 15:26.008
so…

15:26.043 --> 15:28.320
so I'm just gonna…

15:34.259 --> 15:38.506
I don't want to have sex
with you anymore.

15:40.682 --> 15:41.769
Yeah.

15:42.893 --> 15:46.621
Well, as it turns out, as my client,

15:46.855 --> 15:49.555
I'm not supposed to have sex
with you anyway.

15:53.737 --> 15:55.336
So there we are.

15:57.129 --> 15:59.534
There we are.

16:53.504 --> 16:56.674
I'm trying on my Halloween costume.

16:56.709 --> 16:58.122
What are your thoughts?

16:59.594 --> 17:01.971
I prefer to be alone. Please leave.

17:02.006 --> 17:05.183
–Why?
–No reason.

17:05.933 --> 17:07.804
If you were to guess at a reason…

17:07.804 --> 17:09.944
If I were to guess,

17:09.979 --> 17:12.096
I'd say maybe I don't want to socialize

17:12.096 --> 17:14.316
with a pinko liberal Democrat commie.

17:15.776 --> 17:18.053
You may think it's patriotic to dissent,

17:18.053 --> 17:20.467
and maybe it is, sometimes.

17:20.502 --> 17:22.847
But to sue the army in a

17:22.882 --> 17:24.660
time of war is not patriotic.

17:24.702 --> 17:28.279
It borders on treason.
And I'm disgusted with you.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.703
And just so you know, most of

17:30.703 --> 17:32.290
the Democrats voted for this war.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.462
John Kerry voted for it.

17:34.545 --> 17:36.213
Hillary Clinton voted for it.

17:36.213 --> 17:38.341
And now suddenly it becomes unpopular,

17:38.341 --> 17:40.501
say what you will about Republicans,

17:40.756 --> 17:42.016
we stick to our convictions,

17:42.016 --> 17:43.486
even when we know we're dead wrong.

17:43.486 --> 17:44.922
Some might say especially then.

17:44.922 --> 17:48.142
It's not funny, Alan.

17:48.225 --> 17:50.025
I can't look at you right now.

17:50.589 --> 17:52.689
I don't know how you could miss me.

17:54.743 --> 17:58.321
This is how I feel.  I don't want to be
in your company.

18:18.589 --> 18:20.915
On the ground, there's separate rules

18:20.950 --> 18:23.019
for national guards and active duty soldiers.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.094
How do you mean?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.471
Well, guardsmen have to write

18:25.471 --> 18:26.722
home for essential supplies,

18:26.722 --> 18:30.225
little things like flashlights, batteries,

18:30.309 --> 18:31.980
to major stuff like body armor.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.628
You weren't given proper body armor?

18:33.628 --> 18:34.775
None of us were.

18:34.810 --> 18:36.818
Now you were trained as a medic.

18:36.853 --> 18:38.827
Yes, sir. And when I got there

18:38.862 --> 18:40.224
they had me doing MP duty

18:40.224 --> 18:42.185
because there was no one left to do it.

18:42.185 --> 18:44.111
Before I knew it, I was guarding convoys.

18:44.111 --> 18:45.182
With private Elliot?

18:45.182 --> 18:46.240
It happened to a lot of us.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.128
There just aren't enough guys over there.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.765
Corporal, based on what your recruiter told you,

18:50.765 --> 18:52.300
is this what you expected when

18:52.300 --> 18:53.581
you signed up for the national guard?

18:53.581 --> 18:56.736
No, sir. No. I wanted to go
into the medical field.

18:56.771 --> 18:58.317
My recruiter told me that the

18:58.317 --> 18:59.710
government would pay for my medical school,

18:59.710 --> 19:03.254
and that in Iraq I'd be
a medic, never see combat.

19:03.289 --> 19:04.642
Why are you home now?

19:05.606 --> 19:07.380
I was shot.

19:08.424 --> 19:10.017
Thank you, corporal.

19:11.571 --> 19:13.418
You were a soldier in a war.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.369
I was told that I would never see combat.

19:15.369 --> 19:16.791
Is it your testimony that you

19:16.791 --> 19:18.178
were never trained in combat?

19:18.178 --> 19:19.764
That's not my testimony.

19:19.799 --> 19:22.919
And, corporal, before
you joined the national guard,

19:22.927 --> 19:25.200
you were roughly $6,000 in debt.

19:25.235 --> 19:25.867
Yes.

19:25.902 --> 19:28.023
And the government gave you
a hefty signing bonus,

19:28.023 --> 19:30.183
which you used to pay off that debt.

19:30.865 --> 19:31.573
Yes, sir.

19:31.608 --> 19:33.260
And now that you're back at home,

19:33.260 --> 19:36.417
going to college at night, tuition-free
and have a good job,

19:36.417 --> 19:38.480
both of which the government facilitated

19:38.480 --> 19:41.097
based on your training in the national guard.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.243
–Yes, sir.
–And your testimony is

19:43.278 --> 19:46.919
that the government
didn't keep its promises to you.

19:47.814 --> 19:50.135
That is not my testimony.

19:58.938 --> 20:00.099
It's actually a good thing

20:00.099 --> 20:01.274
that they're calling a witness

20:01.274 --> 20:02.798
and that the judge wants
to hear from their side.

20:02.798 --> 20:03.919
It means we've…

20:07.447 --> 20:08.623
made an impression.

20:13.619 --> 20:15.718
–What's this?
–My Halloween costume.

20:15.718 --> 20:18.326
We were gonna be flamingos together.

20:18.361 --> 20:20.934
I decided to be a hunter. Leave.

20:21.495 --> 20:22.990
Hunters shoot flamingos.

20:26.716 --> 20:29.509
Could you excuse us, please?

20:32.972 --> 20:35.259
Denny, whether or not one agrees with the war…

20:35.259 --> 20:36.475
I don't want to talk about it.

20:36.475 --> 20:38.247
Why is that? Why does no one
want to talk about it?

20:38.247 --> 20:39.952
Why can't friends even discuss it?

20:39.952 --> 20:41.346
Because you're either with us or against us,

20:41.346 --> 20:44.586
and I don't want to talk to people
who are against us.

20:51.782 --> 20:55.668
Wicca is a way to reconnect.

20:55.703 --> 20:58.414
In our modern, mechanized world,

20:58.449 --> 21:01.125
people have lost touch with nature,

21:01.160 --> 21:03.460
and Wicca teaches us that

21:03.502 --> 21:05.937
God is in all living things.

21:05.972 --> 21:07.721
What about magic?

21:07.756 --> 21:10.342
The only spells we cast are positive ones.

21:10.377 --> 21:12.341
We believe in the law of three.

21:12.376 --> 21:14.388
Whatever energy you put out in the

21:14.388 --> 21:17.745
world will return to you threefold.

21:17.780 --> 21:21.103
So we promote goodwill, not hexes.

21:21.138 --> 21:25.626
Tell us why you want Mrs Berleth to
end her witch act.

21:25.661 --> 21:28.200
The stereotype, the wicked witch.

21:28.235 --> 21:31.321
My daughter comes home at least once a week crying

21:31.356 --> 21:33.636
because the kids in school torment her

21:33.650 --> 21:36.250
and say she worships the devil.

21:36.285 --> 21:38.197
You don't worship satan, do you, Evelyn?

21:38.197 --> 21:41.004
Wicca has no concept of satan.

21:41.039 --> 21:44.605
The devil and fire and brimstone, hell.

21:46.299 --> 21:48.206
That stuff was dreamed up by Christians.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.733
“Dreamed up”?

21:55.178 --> 21:57.860
Now you said Wicca is an ancient belief.

21:57.895 --> 21:58.712
Yes.

21:58.842 --> 21:59.850
But I'm confused.

21:59.850 --> 22:02.644
Wasn't Wicca made up in England in the 1950s?

22:02.679 --> 22:04.111
It wasn't made up.

22:04.146 --> 22:07.169
It came about after England finally repealed

22:07.204 --> 22:10.193
the last of its witchcraft laws in 1951.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.362
But it's simply a modern

22:12.445 --> 22:14.531
version of an old belief system.

22:14.566 --> 22:15.914
Witchcraft laws?

22:15.949 --> 22:18.083
Laws created in England and Europe

22:18.118 --> 22:20.530
during what are called the burning times.

22:20.530 --> 22:22.622
It started in about 1480 and

22:22.706 --> 22:24.582
went on for hundreds of years.

22:24.617 --> 22:26.459
Tens of thousands of innocent

22:26.543 --> 22:28.211
people were burned at the stake

22:28.211 --> 22:31.339
–Because of these laws.
–Burned by whom?

22:31.374 --> 22:34.426
Well, the Christians.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.350
You said you'd leave out the attacks.

22:42.350 --> 22:44.957
–She didn't attack you.
–Sam, Bob, please.

22:44.992 --> 22:46.380
They're making a mockery of our religion.

22:46.380 --> 22:47.972
I did no such thing,

22:48.830 --> 22:49.778
What?

22:50.203 --> 22:51.203
This is why we came to you.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.138
This is what we were talking about.

22:52.138 --> 22:52.677
Wait a second.

22:52.677 --> 22:54.309
You saw Denise behind our backs?

22:54.309 --> 22:55.741
It wasn't behind your back.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.139
Oh, so then you're a hypocrite.

22:57.139 --> 22:57.860
Hey, hey, hey.

22:57.860 --> 22:59.445
I didn't know I was dealing with a
hypocrite, that's all.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.268
Hey!

23:00.303 --> 23:01.256
Don't push me.

23:01.291 --> 23:02.810
Well, what are you gonna do,
turn me into a toad?

23:02.810 --> 23:04.670
–All right!
–We don't do hexes!

23:05.315 --> 23:07.595
We throw punches occasionally.

23:07.717 --> 23:09.217
All right, that's enough.

23:19.846 --> 23:22.786
I think I know where
you can put your broomstick.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.153
I told private Elliot exactly what

23:27.188 --> 23:29.236
he'd be getting into when he signed up.

23:29.236 --> 23:30.977
I answered all of his questions.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.714
Did you ever lie or mislead private Elliot

23:33.749 --> 23:36.451
when he came into your recruitment office?

23:36.486 --> 23:37.066
No, sir.

23:37.101 --> 23:38.562
We went over his service contract

23:38.562 --> 23:41.478
together, and explained
each provision completely.

23:41.478 --> 23:43.549
I may have emphasized the positive,

23:43.549 --> 23:44.989
but I never lied to him.

23:45.429 --> 23:47.189
You told private Elliot that he'd be

23:47.189 --> 23:48.880
doing things other than cannon loading?

23:48.880 --> 23:52.387
Of course. I explained
all the contingencies to him.

23:52.422 --> 23:54.891
I told him the same thing I tell all recruits.

23:54.891 --> 23:55.650
Really?

23:55.685 --> 23:59.082
This man Mr Dewey, seated in the second row,

23:59.117 --> 24:01.791
went to your recruiting office yesterday
at our direction.

24:01.791 --> 24:02.945
Do you remember speaking with him, sir?

24:02.945 --> 24:03.574
Objection!

24:03.609 --> 24:06.152
Mr Shore? What are you doing here?

24:06.187 --> 24:07.169
Impeachment, your honor.

24:07.169 --> 24:08.942
Sergeant Hendler articulated that he

24:08.942 --> 24:10.680
tells the same thing to all recruits.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.582
Mr Dewey is one of those all.

24:14.221 --> 24:15.517
I will allow it.

24:16.569 --> 24:18.507
But I have my eye on you.

24:19.078 --> 24:20.252
Again, sergeant,

24:20.287 --> 24:23.767
do you remember having a conversation
with this young man?

24:24.519 --> 24:25.968
–Vaguely.
–Vaguely?

24:26.003 --> 24:27.701
You told him the national guard

24:27.701 --> 24:29.329
could train him in sound mixing.

24:29.329 --> 24:32.563
We offer a wide spectrum
of training possibilities.

24:32.598 --> 24:34.954
Isn't it a fact that you never told

24:34.989 --> 24:37.222
Mr Dewey he'd have to do anything else?

24:37.222 --> 24:39.096
You also told him he'd
probably never see combat.

24:39.096 --> 24:40.592
I believe my words were

24:40.627 --> 24:42.589
“hopefully, he'd never see combat”.

24:42.589 --> 24:43.956
And if Mr Dewey says he

24:43.956 --> 24:45.486
never heard the word “hopefully,”

24:45.486 --> 24:46.768
would he be lying or mistaken?

24:46.768 --> 24:47.858
Because he's willing to take a polygraph.

24:47.858 --> 24:49.721
–Objection.
–Sustained.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.105
You also mentioned to him something

24:51.105 --> 24:52.985
about a “Try one” program.

24:53.020 --> 24:54.003
What's that?

24:54.038 --> 24:55.879
Try one is a 1-year trial program.

24:55.879 --> 24:57.450
If you sign up, and you aren't happy

24:57.450 --> 24:58.986
at the end of your 1-year contract,

24:58.986 --> 25:00.712
then you can leave without

25:00.747 --> 25:02.340
officially enlisting in the national guard.

25:02.340 --> 25:03.650
And that's what private Elliot

25:03.650 --> 25:04.720
signed up for, correct?

25:04.720 --> 25:05.429
Yes, sir.

25:05.509 --> 25:07.494
See, this is what confuses me.

25:07.529 --> 25:09.589
Private Elliot served out his year,

25:09.589 --> 25:12.469
fulfilled his contract and clearly wasn't happy.

25:12.488 --> 25:14.125
Why didn't he just come home?

25:14.125 --> 25:15.685
Private Elliot was kept in

25:15.693 --> 25:17.355
Iraq under the stop loss program.

25:17.355 --> 25:19.165
In case you haven't noticed, we're at war.

25:19.165 --> 25:20.043
Yes.

25:20.078 --> 25:23.021
Tell me, sergeant,
under this stop loss program,

25:23.056 --> 25:25.414
how much longer had the military planned

25:25.414 --> 25:27.694
to keep private Elliot in the service?

25:27.702 --> 25:32.489
Private Elliot's obligation
was extended to 2031.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.747
26 years.

25:38.831 --> 25:41.667
Did you tell either Mr Elliot or

25:41.750 --> 25:44.545
Mr Dewey about these contingencies?

25:44.628 --> 25:46.755
We're at war, Mr Shore.

25:46.839 --> 25:48.465
We need soldiers.

25:48.549 --> 25:51.095
Yes. According to our generals
and military advisors,

25:51.095 --> 25:53.607
we need a lot more than
the 140,000 currently over there.

25:53.607 --> 25:55.287
Why are we not sending more?

26:01.580 --> 26:04.400
Are we trying to win this war
or not, sergeant?

26:23.945 --> 26:25.488
Your honor, this is clearly a

26:25.488 --> 26:26.823
stunt. He orchestrated this.

26:26.823 --> 26:28.639
These are the children who will be affected.

26:28.639 --> 26:30.941
That doesn't mean you parade them around
like exhibits.

26:30.941 --> 26:33.213
Counsel, this has already taken up enough time.

26:33.213 --> 26:36.150
Let's just get through this. Step back.

26:47.385 --> 26:50.137
Halloween is a secular holiday

26:50.221 --> 26:52.813
and as you can see, a fun one.

26:52.848 --> 26:54.975
Now the witch at the center of this

26:55.059 --> 26:57.138
case, played with gusto by Mrs Berleth,

26:57.138 --> 26:59.195
is not a symbol of satanism

26:59.230 --> 27:01.899
and in no way defames
the religion of the Wiccans.

27:01.899 --> 27:03.901
The whole pageant, indeed, all of

27:03.984 --> 27:05.938
Halloween everywhere is just make-believe.

27:05.938 --> 27:07.613
And to claim that this somehow

27:07.613 --> 27:09.865
rises to the level of persecution

27:09.900 --> 27:12.117
is not only laughable but offensive.

27:12.201 --> 27:13.494
Persecution is an issue,

27:13.494 --> 27:14.745
which, to be perfectly frank,

27:14.745 --> 27:16.205
neither of these suburban parents

27:16.205 --> 27:18.139
nor their high-priced attorneys
know anything about.

27:18.139 --> 27:19.154
And it's insulting to

27:19.154 --> 27:20.668
groups who have been persecuted

27:20.668 --> 27:23.799
to raise that issue at this time in this case.

27:42.189 --> 27:43.982
The First Amendment says we

27:44.066 --> 27:46.547
shouldn't discriminate against any group

27:46.582 --> 27:49.064
on the basis of region. It's a nice theory.

27:49.064 --> 27:51.323
But the truth is the law is rarely

27:51.406 --> 27:53.652
applied to protect the Christian faith,

27:53.652 --> 27:56.335
because being in the majority,

27:56.370 --> 27:59.122
well, I guess we feel they can take it.

27:59.157 --> 28:01.875
And if the religion is too far out there,

28:01.910 --> 28:04.336
Christian scientists? Sure.

28:04.371 --> 28:06.970
Scientologists? Maybe.

28:07.005 --> 28:09.841
Wiccans? Well, at what point

28:09.925 --> 28:12.656
does a religion become silly enough

28:12.691 --> 28:15.388
that it's okay to make fun of them?

28:15.423 --> 28:17.481
And who decides?

28:17.516 --> 28:20.769
What this case is really about is tolerance.

28:20.804 --> 28:23.219
Whether it's Hindus attacking

28:23.254 --> 28:25.810
Jews or Muslims against Catholics,

28:25.845 --> 28:28.604
Christians fighting with Wiccans,

28:28.639 --> 28:31.363
the aim of the law is tolerance.

28:31.398 --> 28:33.406
And I could be wrong but,

28:33.448 --> 28:35.418
I don't think we ever ratified

28:35.453 --> 28:39.335
persecution under the heading of “fun”.

28:39.663 --> 28:43.500
Let me read you something by Martin Niemoeller,

28:43.535 --> 28:46.616
a German pastor who opposed the Nazis.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.110
“In Germany, they came first
for the communists,”

28:50.145 --> 28:53.301
“and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a communist.

28:53.336 --> 28:54.803
”Then they came for the Jews,“

28:54.803 --> 28:58.640
“and I didn't speak up
because I wasn't a Jew”.

28:58.675 --> 29:01.559
“Then they came for the trade unionists,”

29:01.594 --> 29:03.520
“and I didn't speak up

29:03.603 --> 29:05.681
because I wasn't a trade unionist”.

29:05.681 --> 29:07.690
“Then they came for the Catholics,

29:07.690 --> 29:11.653
and I didn't speak up
because I was a Protestant”.

29:11.688 --> 29:14.193
“Then they came for me,”

29:14.228 --> 29:16.699
“and by that time, there

29:16.741 --> 29:19.285
was no one left to speak up”.

29:33.132 --> 29:37.094
In war, any war, there are casualties.

29:37.129 --> 29:39.468
For the family of a victim

29:39.503 --> 29:41.807
to sue the army for such a

29:41.891 --> 29:44.143
casualty is not only patently ridiculous,

29:44.143 --> 29:45.728
it's an insult.

29:45.811 --> 29:47.719
First, it offends the memory

29:47.754 --> 29:49.663
of the soldier who gave his life

29:49.663 --> 29:52.124
to defend his country.

29:52.159 --> 29:56.085
Worse, it's an attack on patriotism and
the U.S. army itself.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.075
He enlisted. He was trained in combat.

29:59.110 --> 30:02.180
He assumed the risks of combat.

30:02.215 --> 30:05.485
This lawsuit merely represents
a flamboyant attempt

30:05.520 --> 30:10.166
to showcase antiwar sentiment.
It is wrong. It is baseless.

30:10.201 --> 30:13.056
And it's an affront to every soldier,
to every veteran

30:13.056 --> 30:15.114
who has put himself on the line to

30:15.149 --> 30:17.207
defend the United states of America.

30:17.207 --> 30:20.597
Especially, primarily, the ones

30:20.632 --> 30:24.309
who have given their lives to do so.

30:32.566 --> 30:35.386
First, this is hardly about antiwar sentiments.

30:35.396 --> 30:37.286
Private Elliot was for the war.

30:37.321 --> 30:40.046
Personally, I was against it.
Then I was for it.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.736
Then I was against it again.
But that's just me.

30:42.736 --> 30:44.787
I'm a flip-flopper.

30:44.870 --> 30:47.070
But whether one is for or against the occupation,

30:47.070 --> 30:49.235
and let's assume, judging from your tie, one is,

30:49.235 --> 30:51.461
that does not exempt the military from

30:51.461 --> 30:53.775
a duty to be honest with its soldiers.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.173
Private Elliot was told he'd serve a year.

30:56.173 --> 30:57.827
He was told he wouldn't see combat.

30:57.827 --> 30:59.446
Okay, unexpected stuff happens.

30:59.446 --> 31:01.021
He did see combat. Fine.

31:01.056 --> 31:04.721
But he was sent into combat
with insufficient backup.

31:04.756 --> 31:06.741
He was sent in to perform duties

31:06.776 --> 31:08.357
for which he was never, ever trained.

31:08.357 --> 31:10.997
He wasn't given the most basic of equipment.

31:11.025 --> 31:13.658
And then after his tour of duty was finally up,

31:13.658 --> 31:14.809
they wouldn't let him leave.

31:14.809 --> 31:18.924
He never assumed those risks by enlisting.

31:20.664 --> 31:23.080
Over-extended, under-equipped,

31:23.115 --> 31:25.722
non-trained. He never signed up for that.

31:25.757 --> 31:27.436
And now he's dead.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.676
And aside from his sister,
nobody seems to care.

31:31.711 --> 31:33.485
We talk about honoring the troops.

31:33.485 --> 31:35.274
How about we honor them by

31:35.309 --> 31:37.751
giving a damn when they're killed?

31:37.786 --> 31:40.158
Our kids are dying over there.

31:40.193 --> 31:43.244
And this country, the people, the media,

31:43.279 --> 31:46.260
we all chug along like nothing is wrong.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.059
We'll spend a month obsessing
about Terry Schiavo,

31:49.059 --> 31:52.006
but dare we show a body
of a fallen soldier?

31:52.297 --> 31:54.855
The most watched cable news station

31:54.890 --> 31:56.799
will spend an hour a night

31:56.834 --> 31:58.673
on a missing girl in Aruba.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.307
But God forbid we pay any attention

32:01.342 --> 32:03.907
when kids like private Elliot,
 killed in action…

32:03.907 --> 32:06.437
–You're off the point.
–I'm not off the point.

32:06.437 --> 32:08.977
We've had 2,000 American trees

32:09.012 --> 32:11.483
fall in that forest over there,

32:11.518 --> 32:14.980
and we don't even know it, not really.

32:15.015 --> 32:16.875
But maybe we don't want to know

32:16.882 --> 32:17.831
about our children dying.

32:17.831 --> 32:20.855
So lucky for us, this war isn't really
being televised.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.835
We're not seeing images of soldiers

32:22.835 --> 32:24.746
dying in the arms of their comrades,

32:24.746 --> 32:26.581
being blown apart
in the streets of Baghdad.

32:26.581 --> 32:29.572
But they are by the thousands.

32:29.607 --> 32:32.003
And all the American public wants to
concern itself with

32:32.003 --> 32:34.521
is whether Brad and Angelina
really are a couple.

32:34.521 --> 32:37.556
At least with Vietnam, we all watched,
and we all got angry.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.557
What does this have to do with
the death of private Elliot?

32:40.557 --> 32:42.896
Private Elliot is dead, in part,

32:42.931 --> 32:46.051
because we have a people
and a government in denial.

32:46.411 --> 32:49.883
We currently have no strategy to fight this war.

32:49.918 --> 32:51.326
We have no timetable for getting out.

32:51.326 --> 32:54.103
Some of these troops
could be extended 20-plus years.

32:54.103 --> 32:56.639
Their mothers and fathers have
to spring for body armor

32:56.639 --> 32:59.141
because the army doesn't,
and they're getting killed!

32:59.141 --> 33:02.882
And we, as a nation in denial,
are letting them.

33:02.917 --> 33:06.589
We simply don't seem to care.
Well, she does.

33:06.624 --> 33:12.113
She's in this courtroom
honoring one dead soldier.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.374
That's a start.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.848
We're dealing here with a pageant
in a public school.

33:46.883 --> 33:51.552
A public school can't promote the
exercise of any religion,

33:51.587 --> 33:55.441
and it can't denigrate
the followers of any religion.

33:55.934 --> 34:00.647
No one should take that lightly. And indeed,

34:00.682 --> 34:02.941
Christians, witches and other groups

34:03.025 --> 34:05.200
have been persecuted over the years,

34:05.235 --> 34:08.947
and no one should take persecution lightly.

34:08.982 --> 34:10.746
But…

34:10.782 --> 34:14.161
we should take Halloween lightly.

34:14.196 --> 34:16.413
As the defense pointed out,

34:16.496 --> 34:18.588
Halloween is a secular holiday.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.882
But more importantly,
it's a silly holiday.

34:21.918 --> 34:26.505
Children don't see a witch
as a symbol of any sort.

34:26.541 --> 34:31.094
A witch is just something
to enjoy being afraid of.

34:31.129 --> 34:33.645
Motion by the plaintiffs is denied.

34:33.679 --> 34:37.225
The Halloween pageant
will go on as it always has.

34:37.260 --> 34:40.152
And I advise both parties to lighten up

34:40.187 --> 34:44.858
and remember what Halloween really is all about.

34:44.893 --> 34:47.824
The candy. Court adjourned.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.538
–Sorry.
–Oh, it's okay.

34:51.572 --> 34:54.146
–We forgive you.
–I thought you might.

34:55.737 --> 34:57.481
–Thank you both.
–Bye.

34:58.298 --> 35:00.077
–I'm sorry.
–Thank you.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.420
Listen, tonight's Samhain,

35:05.503 --> 35:08.138
that's what we call Halloween.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.259
There's a women's circle
after the celebration.

35:11.294 --> 35:12.976
It's a full moon.

35:13.011 --> 35:14.723
It's the perfect time for letting the

35:14.723 --> 35:19.309
energy of the goddess
heal and restore you.

35:19.344 --> 35:23.187
You need it. I'll fax you directions.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.523
Thank you so much.

35:30.194 --> 35:33.819
Do I strike you as being out of harmony?

35:41.414 --> 35:43.708
All rise!

35:56.929 --> 35:59.939
This war is a disaster.

35:59.974 --> 36:03.936
It has been sold to America
on a false premise.

36:03.971 --> 36:05.759
The government has been repeatedly told

36:05.759 --> 36:09.779
by its most senior military advisors
that it needs far more troops.

36:09.900 --> 36:14.412
The advisors have been ignored or in
some cases even fired,

36:14.613 --> 36:17.657
and now we have what very much looks

36:17.692 --> 36:20.702
like the beginning of another Vietnam,

36:20.737 --> 36:24.623
except, as Mr Shore points out,

36:24.707 --> 36:28.085
without the necessary outrage.

36:28.169 --> 36:32.132
That said, like it or not, we are at war.

36:32.167 --> 36:35.375
And the one thing that keeps the

36:35.410 --> 36:39.276
military functioning in war is its hierarchy.

36:39.311 --> 36:41.781
Orders are given, orders followed.

36:41.816 --> 36:44.217
That's why congress has granted the

36:44.252 --> 36:47.399
military immunity in lawsuits like this.

36:49.072 --> 36:51.074
Miss Elliot, I have the deepest

36:51.109 --> 36:54.935
sympathy for you and for your brother.

36:55.641 --> 36:56.958
However…

36:58.030 --> 37:00.838
I rule in favor of the government.

37:00.873 --> 37:03.647
The motion to dismiss is granted.

37:12.588 --> 37:15.090
I hope at least somebody
heard your screams.

37:15.090 --> 37:18.978
If not, then maybe they heard
yours. Thank you.

37:24.224 --> 37:28.902
Well… Bye.

37:28.937 --> 37:33.240
–Why?
–I'm sorry?

37:33.275 --> 37:35.484
Why does it have to be good-bye?

37:50.208 --> 37:52.875
We lost, if it's any consolation.

37:52.910 --> 37:54.629
It isn't.

37:55.213 --> 37:57.340
Anybody who truly loves this country, Denny,

37:57.340 --> 37:59.592
must at least try to

37:59.676 --> 38:01.886
understand the awful truth over there.

38:01.886 --> 38:03.930
One of the reasons it's happening over there

38:03.930 --> 38:05.390
Is so it won't happen here.

38:05.390 --> 38:07.434
I'm afraid I don't agree with you, Denny.

38:07.434 --> 38:10.145
But if Americans can continue to

38:10.228 --> 38:12.928
nurture the expression of differing opinions,

38:12.939 --> 38:16.860
what's happening over there
will never happen here.

38:44.752 --> 38:46.230
I don't, I don't think

38:46.265 --> 38:48.410
people recognize our costumes.

38:48.445 --> 38:50.555
Maybe we should use the accents.

38:59.310 --> 39:02.071
I give you my word.  I'm not trying to
be disrespectful.

39:02.071 --> 39:05.060
I just wanted to feel… hot.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.391
Tried it on.

39:23.426 --> 39:25.184
Looked good. Kept it on.

39:25.219 --> 39:29.014
–Doesn't mean I forgive you.
–Got it.

39:29.049 --> 39:32.399
Denny? You look pretty in pink.

39:32.434 --> 39:36.522
–Not having sex with you.
–Just the same.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.031
What exactly is our costume again?

39:46.066 --> 39:47.660
It's, um,

39:47.695 --> 39:49.387
“I look good in white tails”.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.282
Ah. Right.

39:54.123 --> 39:56.583
Thank you. Did I say that?

39:56.618 --> 40:00.041
To Alan Shore you did.

40:00.076 --> 40:03.465
–Nothing for you?
–No.

40:28.782 --> 40:30.784
What are you thinking about?

40:34.037 --> 40:36.456
It's not a trick question.

40:38.375 --> 40:42.379
Can I have a solitary, pensive moment,

40:42.414 --> 40:44.596
keep a thought to myself?

40:44.631 --> 40:47.551
You forgot what you were thinking.

40:52.264 --> 40:54.124
I don't presume to know whether

40:54.140 --> 40:55.892
this is a good war or not, Denny.

40:55.892 --> 40:58.513
But there can be no dispute
it's a complex one,

40:58.513 --> 41:02.691
one that we as a citizenry, as patriots,

41:02.726 --> 41:05.033
need to be talking about.

41:05.068 --> 41:08.071
Here's all you need to know,
put me in charge.

41:08.106 --> 41:12.200
I'll win the damn thing.
–No doubt.

41:12.235 --> 41:13.246
Do you think the army

41:13.246 --> 41:15.787
would let two flamingos enlist?

41:15.822 --> 41:19.124
Don't ask, don't tell.

41:23.837 --> 41:26.541
Most of the Cranes in my family were flamingos.

41:26.541 --> 41:28.508
Indeed.
