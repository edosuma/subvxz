♪ ♪

00:48.682 --> 00:50.949
Oh!

00:51.018 --> 00:53.084
This is more uncomfortable
than I would have thought!

00:53.120 --> 00:54.752
It's all right.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.355
It doesn't make you feel sick?

00:59.359 --> 01:00.826
What's that?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.961
Reading while in motion.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.629
No.
Why would it?

01:04.698 --> 01:06.832
It does for many people.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.233
Well, not me.

01:10.704 --> 01:14.640
So, why didn't I come
straight to toronto?

01:14.642 --> 01:17.775
Well, I was informed that
the railway line was damaged

01:17.812 --> 01:19.912
And rather than make you wait
for the repair,

01:19.914 --> 01:21.580
I thought I'd come
and get you.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.548
Your father's very
excited to see you.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.051
Then why didn't he
come to pick me up?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.255
Well, he was occupied at work.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.258
Besides, I felt
like the journey.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.193
I thought it would be
a nice opportunity

01:35.262 --> 01:37.129
For you to see
the country.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.664
Yes, well there it is.
Country.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.702
(coachman):
Come on. Hep.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.879
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.481
Don't lie to me.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.416
I've seen my mother's
face look like that

01:57.551 --> 01:58.617
When something's wrong.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.691
Ahh!

02:06.760 --> 02:08.793
That doesn't sound
like nothing to me.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.796
Hey!
Don't shoot at us!

02:11.866 --> 02:13.565
(ogden): Please don't shoot!
We're coming out.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.567
You two, out of the coach.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.135
Now.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.977
Idiot.
I said no one was to get hurt.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.314
Least not yet.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.450
Ralph fellows.

02:31.452 --> 02:35.053
Dr. Ogden. What a pleasure
to renew our acquaintance.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.524
Oh, this must be young harry.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.192
Oh, pleased to meet you.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.401
(grunts)

02:50.538 --> 02:52.471
- I'll wrap it as best I can.
- It hurts.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.606
The bullet went
straight through.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.409
Do you know these men?

02:58.445 --> 02:59.911
No.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.913
(fellows):
Let's get going, doctor.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.315
When I'm finished.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.216
(man):
It doesn't look too bad to me.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.320
- Surprised you hit him.
- I meant to wing him.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.888
It was deliberate.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.056
That's a laugh.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.624
(fellows):
Okay, you two.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.160
- Ready to go?
- Born ready, boss.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.697
- Can you two ride?
- I can ride.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.699
Oh, well, aren't you something?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.700
All right, well, as they
say in the vernacular,

03:22.736 --> 03:24.335
Let's saddle up.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.405
Oh, you, too.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.174
Unless your condition
doesn't allow for it.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.310
I can handle it.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.883
So, you will be
at the party tonight?

03:38.018 --> 03:40.319
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

03:40.454 --> 03:43.121
How could you not?
It'll be a lively affair.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.591
There'll be music, readings,
a female imposter.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.860
Oh!
So, a low-key affair.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.730
Llewellyn, there's very little
I do that is low-key.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.531
And I'd very much
like you to come.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.000
I don't think I can.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.135
I'm still in the employ
of the constabulary.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.271
As such, discretion--

03:59.406 --> 04:01.006
...Is for the cowardly.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.941
And I fear I'm starting
to count you among them.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.744
Besides, I already
have a friend.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.078
You know that.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.947
Yes, I know you have a friend
who is married to a woman.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.384
Llewellyn, you deserve
better than that.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.619
I'm not asking to be
your one and only:

04:14.688 --> 04:17.589
Just your once
in a while.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.859
You're being a bit forward,
mr. Strange.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.228
There's no other way to be.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.530
If only that were so.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.044
- Here you are, my queen.
- Oh, thank you, arthur.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.379
What time shall I gather you?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.913
- When I call.
- Very good.

04:48.188 --> 04:52.390
You know what they say:
Happy wife, happy life.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.326
Do you believe that
to be true?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.527
I do.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.730
And your happiness is
not of concern to you?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.199
Good day, detective.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.740
All right, rest time's over.
Let's get going.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.276
Don't worry about leaving
an obvious trail.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.477
Come on.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.981
- Otto, keep an eye on them.
- Yes, sir.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.618
- Where are you taking us?
- (fellows): Uh, you'll see.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.620
A good looking young man.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.890
One can definitely
see the resemblance.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.858
If you harm him,
mr. Fellows--

05:26.927 --> 05:29.094
Good-looking people have it a
little easier, don't you think?

05:30.197 --> 05:32.230
I guess some people
are just born lucky,

05:32.266 --> 05:34.032
Others have to make
their own luck.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.801
So, I guess yours was all bad.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.436
Well, you got spunk.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.904
Not really.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.140
I was simply taught
to tell the truth.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.778
Well, at least you have a little
more wit than your old man.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.912
Very little.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.549
Let's get going.
Otto, come on.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.856
I don't like him.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.390
Not many do.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.060
Don't worry.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.528
I'll make sure
you're all right.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.002
- Watts.
- Detective.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.604
I'm heading out.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.742
That is apparent.
Anything of interest?

06:17.811 --> 06:20.011
Yes. A woman has
been reported missing.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.750
But I wouldn't want to tear
you away from your reading.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.686
Mr. Strange's work is
a little over my head,

06:28.756 --> 06:30.755
But I do find it
mesmerizing.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.090
Clearly.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.226
Poets see the world
through different eyes

06:34.361 --> 06:35.326
Than the rest of us.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.162
I'm sure they do.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.230
And who is this missing woman?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.167
A mrs. Clara walker.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.003
- Good lord.
- What?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.706
Clara walker.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.976
That's jack walker's wife.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.212
The butcher?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.917
Uh, with your permission,
could I take the lead on this?

06:59.719 --> 07:01.052
Can you remain objective?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.821
Of course.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.793
Yes. Yes, yes.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.004
And when did you notice
clara was missing?

07:20.474 --> 07:23.208
Uh, she had taken samuel to her
parents' house last evening.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.677
She never returned.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.479
And samuel?

07:27.481 --> 07:28.814
He's with her parents.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.685
So, she disappeared sometime

07:33.754 --> 07:36.221
After dropping samuel
off at her parent's home?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.422
(jack):
Yes.

07:41.895 --> 07:45.363
Jack, are you sure
she didn't just leave?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.032
No.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.435
- Jack?
- Perhaps.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.772
Perhaps?
Why do you say that?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.373
She had become
displeased with me

07:55.375 --> 07:57.308
And my relationship
with you.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.180
Enough to abandon her child?

08:02.249 --> 08:04.649
I don't think so, but

08:04.718 --> 08:06.117
I don't know for certain.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.993
What's your feeling
on this, watts?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.861
I'm not sure what you mean.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.799
I imagine you know
the family some.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.066
I do.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.404
Would clara walker abandon
her husband and child?

08:28.208 --> 08:31.810
Her marriage is an important
symbol of stability for her.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.478
Proof that she's not
a fallen woman.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.650
Even if her husband
doesn't love her?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.687
Jack has great affection
for clara.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.492
Perhaps affection
wasn't enough.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.797
Sir!
You need to see this.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.501
"coach from guelph
to toronto attacked.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.737
Woman and child
taken prisoner."

09:01.008 --> 09:02.541
That's julia and
harry.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.674
(stammering)

09:04.778 --> 09:06.911
Uh, telephone the livery--

09:06.980 --> 09:08.379
Go. I can handle
what's happening here.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.447
Yes.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.786
I do hope you enjoy
your new accommodations.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.258
You'll be staying here.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.399
You stay with 'em.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.704
When do we get paid for this?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.271
I have told you.

09:34.308 --> 09:37.208
You will get paid
when the job is done.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.345
We have the woman and child.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.014
Isn't the job done?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.316
Oh, no, my thick-skulled
hessian.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.751
(chuckles)

09:46.820 --> 09:48.153
Not by a long shot.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.055
(laughs)

10:03.604 --> 10:04.769
Hello.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.570
You're not looking
for your wife?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.240
She left on her own accord.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.574
She won't be found
lest she wants to.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.577
I thought she was...

10:12.646 --> 10:15.313
Comfortable with
the arrangement.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.514
So did I.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.918
- Well I still need to find her.
- I know.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.619
- The child...
- I said I know!

10:28.061 --> 10:29.794
Whatever mr. Fellows
is paying you,

10:29.863 --> 10:30.795
I can pay you more.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.363
Just to let us go.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.631
(scoffs)

10:33.766 --> 10:35.600
That's if he pays you at all.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.535
Not interested.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.204
At least let the boy go.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.473
- He's done nothing wrong.
- No can do. Sorry.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.443
I could outrun
the two of you, you know.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.846
Can you outrun a bullet?

10:47.848 --> 10:51.248
I've seen you shoot, so I'm not
worried much about that.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.118
Watch your mouth, son.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.754
Heard he grew up
without a father.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.357
And what of it?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.693
Means he never had a chance
to learn manners.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.360
Isn't that right?

11:03.397 --> 11:04.562
That's right.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.231
What's your excuse?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.435
Out of my way.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.436
What are you going to do
if I don't?

11:15.242 --> 11:16.574
Sit down!

11:26.286 --> 11:27.718
Mr. And mrs. Cartwright.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.855
Where's detective murdoch?

11:30.857 --> 11:32.590
He had urgent business.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.126
More urgent than the fact our
daughter is missing?

11:35.195 --> 11:37.128
- Well, it's a different...
- So, we're stuck with you?

11:37.164 --> 11:38.529
It would appear so.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.332
Well, this is less than ideal.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.801
I am more than capable
of finding your daughter.

11:43.837 --> 11:47.138
Yes. We know all about you
and what you're capable of.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.474
Our daughter told us.
It's shameful.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.944
Be that as it may,

11:53.079 --> 11:55.546
I am still charged with
finding out where she is.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.451
She's been taken prisoner,
or some ill has befallen her.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.154
- You're sure about that?
- Yes!

12:03.823 --> 12:04.989
She was happy!

12:06.293 --> 12:09.160
And she loved her child and she
would never leave samuel.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.896
And she had come to terms with
her husband's

12:12.031 --> 12:13.164
Immoral
behaviour.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.966
Yes.
Despite her...

12:14.968 --> 12:16.701
Unfortunate circumstances,

12:16.836 --> 12:19.370
She was happy
and she was content.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.306
Something has happened
to our daughter, detective.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.583
Detective murdoch?

12:33.686 --> 12:34.718
Yes.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.988
Billy williams.
I'm sorry.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.323
There's nothing we could do.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.925
- Are the woman and child safe?
- When I last saw them.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.994
I tried to follow,
but I was in no condition.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.597
- How many were they?
- Four men. All on horse.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.531
Any idea what direction
they went in?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.467
No. But I have a man
who could find them.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.668
Uriah.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.375
Seems the detective will be
requiring your assistance.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.744
Then he best ask for it
himself.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.447
If you need someone found around
here, uriah's the man for you.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.716
- That so?
- That is indeed so.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.885
Dollar a day.
Ten when I find them.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.221
- I'm a police officer.
- No matter to me.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.090
You still pay me
for what I'm worth.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.625
Man here tells me that

13:14.694 --> 13:16.160
The missing are
your wife and child.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.162
- That so?
- Yes.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.064
Then I think they're worth more
than a dollar a day.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.367
Fine.
And you can find them?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.036
You want that to happen,
we best start looking.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.504
We got light
on our side.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.440
I trust your animal still has
some hours left in her?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.774
- Yes.
- Good.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.076
All right.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.045
If I could have done
anything more, sir.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.048
I'm sure you did all you could
under the circumstances.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.117
The man who seemed to be the
leader, he left me with this.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.461
(fellows): All right, that's it.
Back in the barn.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.196
He hasn't finished eating.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.199
Hey!

13:55.202 --> 13:56.634
Now he's finished.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.136
Yeah, quite the thing, huh?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.606
Yeah, you fall in that,
one second, you're here,

14:01.675 --> 14:03.807
Next second,
you're gone.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.576
Are you trying to scare me?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.145
(fellows):
Well, the child, actually.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.479
Well, I'm not scared.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.848
Oh, good for you.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.483
Where's your husband?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.685
On your trail, probably.

14:14.754 --> 14:15.887
Good.

14:16.022 --> 14:16.954
Good?

14:16.990 --> 14:18.589
I've been waiting
impatiently for him.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.158
We have unfinished business.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.427
Come on.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.474
Someone's lucky day.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.378
Not funny.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.780
Although with her out of the
picture, I can safely say

14:42.782 --> 14:44.281
The lucky day is not mine.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.389
What a curious fellow.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.589
Mr. Strange?

14:52.626 --> 14:54.258
No, mr. Walker.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.593
Why do you say that?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.329
Well, look at him.
At work.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.166
It's unusual behaviour
for a man with a missing wife.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.635
If my ruthie were gone,

15:05.805 --> 15:07.405
I'd be turning over heaven
and earth to find her.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.683
Six horses, I'd say.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.352
Two from the wagon.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.887
How can you tell?

15:23.022 --> 15:24.621
I shoe those horses.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.690
These tracks bear my mark.

15:27.894 --> 15:28.893
Funny, though.

15:29.829 --> 15:30.761
What's that?

15:31.965 --> 15:33.764
They're not making
an effort to stay hidden.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.637
Harry, no! You're only
going to hurt your wrists.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.906
- I can get out.
- No, you can't.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.441
That's a constrictor knot.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.176
There's no way
to get out of it.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.243
How do you know that?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.313
Your father's not the only one
who knows things.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.915
I guess.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.220
Now, young harry,
I have a question for you.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.990
Which of these three men do you
think is the weakest link?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.862
The german.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.831
And why do you say that?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.632
He's not a real cowboy.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.436
And he thinks he's gonna be
cheated out of his pay.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.939
If he had a better offer,

16:15.008 --> 16:17.608
He would double-cross
these guys in a heartbeat.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.679
My thoughts exactly.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.585
(watts):
Hello?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.024
Anyone?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.592
(woman):
Who's there?

17:08.661 --> 17:09.994
(watts clearing throat)

17:12.866 --> 17:14.065
Excuse me?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.933
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?

17:15.969 --> 17:17.835
All her things
are still here.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.206
She wore this...

17:22.208 --> 17:23.407
Every day.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.610
St. Christopher.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.378
The patron saint
of travelers.

17:29.849 --> 17:33.350
Whatever's happened to clara
was not of her own making.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.020
I understand your suspicions,

17:37.090 --> 17:39.490
But I know jack walker
to be a good man.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.959
I never said he had anything
to do with it, did I?

17:41.995 --> 17:44.895
But someone has taken my
daughter, detective.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.932
And if someone's taken her,
we will find her.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.634
Believe me.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.837
I wish I could.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.056
They were here
about five hours ago.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.459
Right.
Which way?

18:15.929 --> 18:17.661
The only way you can tell is by
picking one.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.130
See if we can
find the trail again.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.031
Not very scientific.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.268
Here, call it.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.270
Heads are left,
tails are right.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.140
Looks like we're going left.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.242
What if we're wrong?

18:33.246 --> 18:34.945
We double back,
go the proper way.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.090
So, I hear mr. Fellows
hasn't paid you any money.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.262
I know him, you know.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.764
Be quiet.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.066
He's not a trustworthy man.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.703
More?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.470
Yes, please.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.375
(ogden):
I have money.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.310
A lot more
than mr. Fellows.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.513
If you let us go...

19:08.648 --> 19:09.580
(henchman): You getting
friendly, sauerkraut?

19:11.017 --> 19:12.783
Just giving them water.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.518
- Yeah?
- Mm.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.752
Well, they had enough.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.134
Hope the german wasn't
getting fresh with you.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.468
He wasn't.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.605
Well, just so you know,
he has it in him.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.174
So be mindful.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.482
Don't worry, harry.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.018
I'm not.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.419
Neither should you be.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.854
I've been in worse.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.357
Have you?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.959
You know what?
So have I.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.227
Really?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.962
Really.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.496
I was buried alive once.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.899
Really?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.367
Really.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.102
- Wow.
- I don't recommend it.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.781
Do you need something?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.349
Who are you?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.185
Detective llewelyn watts.
Toronto constabulary.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.587
What other constabulary
would you be from?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.022
Oh.
Very good.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.526
Is this about clara?
I'm her neighbour.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.794
And what do you
know about clara?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.063
I know that she is missing.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.065
Her mother told me.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.803
And do you have any wisdom as to
what might have happened to her?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.404
I do not.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.606
My family and I
keep to ourselves.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.910
Despite the fact you're keenly
interested in her fate.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.079
Who said that?

20:48.081 --> 20:50.414
Well, why would you be
in here if you weren't?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.951
Only because there
is little else to do.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.286
I see.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.755
And have you
noticed anything

20:57.757 --> 20:59.357
Suspicious
around here lately?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.159
Define suspicious.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.429
Something out of the ordinary.

21:07.066 --> 21:10.634
You know, yesterday,
I thought I might have.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.802
What's that?

21:12.739 --> 21:15.239
I saw a man
prowling around here.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.508
A man?
What can you tell me about him?

21:17.643 --> 21:18.709
Well...

21:20.446 --> 21:22.913
At first, I thought he was
a strange man. But...

21:24.450 --> 21:27.584
In retrospect, I think it might
have been her husband.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.786
I see. And...

21:31.057 --> 21:33.457
Why would you consider
that suspicious?

21:34.727 --> 21:37.328
Mr. Walker is never
around during the day.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.531
He leaves at sunup for work and
arrives back home after sundown,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.165
Regular as clockwork.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.735
It's almost as if
he hated being home.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.870
I see.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.437
And I do understand that.

21:48.241 --> 21:49.239
Do you?

21:50.009 --> 21:52.543
There are rumours about him.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.779
Ah, what sort of rumours?

21:56.949 --> 21:58.782
That he is a bit of a molly.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.753
That when he wasn't playing
loving husband,

22:02.755 --> 22:06.424
He was gadabouting
all over town.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.758
I see.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.961
And you believe the man
you saw prowling around

22:11.030 --> 22:12.296
Was jack walker.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.364
I do.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.101
Uh, one more question.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.668
Of course.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.572
Do you know where
clara would go

22:21.641 --> 22:23.307
When she wanted to be alone
with her thoughts?

22:25.311 --> 22:27.811
She often took samuel
down by the pond.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.981
For a married woman,
she had the demeanour

22:30.983 --> 22:32.850
Of someone
very much alone.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.124
(door closing)

22:45.164 --> 22:46.664
Get your hands off me!

22:47.367 --> 22:48.999
Shh!

22:49.001 --> 22:50.200
You have money?

22:52.939 --> 22:53.937
How much?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.209
One hundred dollars.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.010
Give it to me.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.345
When you let us go.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.848
Tonight.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.630
What are you doing?
Why are we stopping?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.233
Not going any further tonight.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.902
Not unless you want
to kill your horse.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.105
My wife!
And my son!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.040
I'd say if whoever has them
wanted them dead,

23:30.176 --> 23:31.875
They would have shot them
when they took the coach.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.877
Wouldn't you say, detective?

23:35.381 --> 23:36.447
I suppose.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.916
No supposing about it.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.656
Where are the horses?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.191
No horses for you.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.059
Then how are we supposed to
get out of here?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.327
Shh!

23:50.329 --> 23:53.029
Main road is ten
miles that way.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.400
Madam, better get going.

23:59.338 --> 24:00.637
Come, harry.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.910
Not much call for
a man like me anymore.

24:08.681 --> 24:09.546
Why is that?

24:11.184 --> 24:13.751
You have telephones.
Automobiles.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.688
No one goes missing
unless they want to.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.026
- Want some?
- I don't drink.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.229
It's just water.

24:25.231 --> 24:28.499
I don't drink either...
Not on the job.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.302
Why are we waiting?

24:34.106 --> 24:36.507
'cause in the dark,
we'd just be running in circles.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.208
We'll pick up the trail
first thing.

24:39.712 --> 24:40.844
Don't worry.

24:42.047 --> 24:43.247
He's not going to hurt her.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.250
That's the second time
you've said that.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.852
How can you be sure?

24:50.490 --> 24:53.057
What kind of man would hurt
a woman with child?

24:58.197 --> 25:00.597
(panting)

25:00.666 --> 25:02.065
Are you all right?

25:03.269 --> 25:05.536
A bit winded.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.837
I just need a moment
to catch my breath.

25:10.609 --> 25:11.609
Here.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.944
Thank you, harry.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.757
Are you sure you're all right?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.227
How could I not be with such
a thoughtful travel companion?

25:32.365 --> 25:34.231
Want to know a secret?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.700
I most definitely do.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.636
I always kinda
wanted a brother.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.439
You might end up with a sister.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.075
I wouldn't mind that,
as long as she's tough like you.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.177
(ogden laughs)

25:49.382 --> 25:50.914
It's not exactly
how you imagined

25:50.950 --> 25:52.716
Your trip back to
canada to go.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.718
Unexpected things.

25:54.853 --> 25:55.986
Pardon?

25:56.121 --> 25:59.122
My mother told me to expect
unexpected things.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.391
So you're never surprised?

26:02.528 --> 26:03.493
Never.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.697
That's a shame.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.399
Surprise!

26:11.137 --> 26:12.803
Think we'll be making
our way back to town.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.871
- Please, no. Just let us go.
- Can't do that.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.807
So, let's be quick about it.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.248
(man): Little further
down the shoreline!

26:25.318 --> 26:26.816
(man 2):
All right, mind yourself there.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.184
(man 3):
It's a little deep.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.489
Just a few moments more, lads,

26:32.491 --> 26:33.757
Then we'll bring
this to a close.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.426
(mosquito buzzing)

26:35.561 --> 26:37.094
Not a moment too soon.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.064
(men chatting in background)

26:42.568 --> 26:43.901
(man):
Been through here?

26:45.237 --> 26:46.770
(man 2):
Ah, no, not there yet.

26:48.774 --> 26:49.573
Oh, dear.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.843
Fellows, I think I've found
something.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.945
(man):
You got 'er?

27:00.152 --> 27:01.785
Get mrs. Hart, please.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.520
It's hardly necessary, is it?

27:03.656 --> 27:04.988
Even I can tell she drowned.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.590
Drowned, or was drowned?

27:07.827 --> 27:09.159
Makes her equally dead.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.000
On your knees.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.468
I will not.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.205
Don't touch me!
I'm with child.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.140
(fellows):
Gentlemen! Manners.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.810
After all, we are civilized.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.213
Get her a chair.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.317
How'd you get away?

27:35.888 --> 27:38.222
- We got away by ourselves.
- Remarkable.

27:39.325 --> 27:41.158
- Isn't it, mr. Rooster?
- Indeed it is.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.225
Yeah.

27:42.294 --> 27:45.495
Although it does
make one wonder.

27:46.699 --> 27:49.099
How did otto get a hundred
dollars in his pocket?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.101
- I know how it got there.
- So do I.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.538
How much am I paying
you gentlemen?

27:54.540 --> 27:56.005
Nothing, yet.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.843
How much have I promised
to pay you men?

27:59.912 --> 28:02.545
One hundred fifty,
divided three ways.

28:04.116 --> 28:08.017
What would that be
divided by two?

28:13.058 --> 28:14.058
Ah!

28:19.265 --> 28:23.267
I'd say it's now 75 a head.
That right?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.436
Is now.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.538
What about the hundred dollars
that the lady gave otto?

28:27.540 --> 28:30.073
Oh, let's not be greedy,
mr. Smith.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.842
After all, I have
funeral expenses.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.347
(both laugh)

28:45.124 --> 28:46.856
(jack):
I suppose it is possible.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.225
You always told me
she was happy.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.830
I may have been
lying to myself.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.632
And you.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.769
We both live in lies, don't we?

29:00.039 --> 29:01.905
Sometimes they're necessary.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.444
When will you be
releasing her body?

29:08.481 --> 29:11.047
Once our coroner has done
a full investigation.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.350
Will she be able to find
a broken heart?

29:16.322 --> 29:19.088
- What are you saying?
- That I as much as killed her.

29:20.659 --> 29:24.928
I married her to save
myself from shame,

29:25.063 --> 29:26.730
To save my
business.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.866
She obviously
couldn't cope with it.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.870
Don't blame yourself.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.406
Who do I blame?

29:39.812 --> 29:42.479
(laughter)

29:45.217 --> 29:46.550
Did you enjoy it?

29:47.886 --> 29:49.620
I did.
Thank you.

29:50.523 --> 29:51.955
You should have come in,

29:51.991 --> 29:53.891
Dined in more pleasant
surroundings.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.026
Oh, this suits me just fine,
arthur.

29:58.798 --> 29:59.763
(sighs)

30:03.736 --> 30:05.802
What happened to this
poor unfortunate?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.172
(hart):
She got married.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.109
Sometimes a fate like hers is
the end result of a poor union.

30:14.112 --> 30:15.645
You're a hard woman,
mrs. Hart.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.382
When need be.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.416
A quality I very much adore.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.120
I know that, arthur.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.654
I should get back to her.

30:32.798 --> 30:36.065
(men chatting indistinctly)

30:42.274 --> 30:43.806
Oh, good lord!

30:45.811 --> 30:47.411
I think that's good.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.979
Don't.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.748
I take it those are the two
you're looking for.

30:53.719 --> 30:54.884
(murdoch):
Indeed.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.019
(uriah):
That'll be twelve dollars.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.222
You're leaving?

30:59.225 --> 31:00.490
I done my job.

31:02.628 --> 31:03.927
I could deputize you.

31:04.963 --> 31:07.697
And I'd refuse.
I'm not a violent man.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
Judging by the situation,
I'd say trouble's brewing.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.736
I got my own troubles.

31:14.573 --> 31:15.672
Fair enough.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.913
Good luck to you.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.388
Maybe your husband's
love isn't so true.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.789
Excuse me?

31:32.858 --> 31:35.591
Well, his wife and only son

31:35.628 --> 31:38.395
Abducted by a violent gang.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.363
Where is he?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.000
Especially since we
didn't hide our trail.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.802
We're really easy to find.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.938
Maybe the man's enjoying
his freedom.

31:47.940 --> 31:51.608
Little time off from the brat
and the ball and chain.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.043
You're a coward,
mr. Fellows.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.813
And not half the man
my husband is.

31:56.882 --> 31:58.481
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.853
You're a hotel detective
pretending to be a cowboy.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.758
And despite your many
attempts to harm us,

32:07.893 --> 32:09.092
You've done
nothing but fail.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.827
You watch your mouth.

32:10.863 --> 32:12.295
How does it feel?

32:12.331 --> 32:13.430
How does what feel?

32:13.499 --> 32:15.698
Living your life as a failure.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.533
I am the farthest thing
from a failure.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.636
I am a victim

32:20.772 --> 32:22.572
Of unfortunate
circumstances.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.408
Well, that is something
a failure would say.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.178
(harry):
My father will find you.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.447
That's what I'm counting on.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.688
I'm sorry, harry.

32:39.858 --> 32:40.791
For what?

32:40.926 --> 32:42.993
I should have gotten
you out of this.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.660
It's all right.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.329
We're still going to get away.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.531
I wish I had your confidence.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.340
It's not confidence.
Look.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.346
Wha... What is he doing?

33:04.583 --> 33:06.016
He's sending a message.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.876
They won't let me see samuel.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.478
A reasonable enough reaction.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.880
He is my son.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.347
And you are not the father.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.548
I'm as good as.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.017
And I'm the only one he has.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.152
Detective watts.
A moment?

34:16.221 --> 34:17.554
Is this about clara?

34:18.723 --> 34:20.257
My attention is directed
at the detective, sir.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.324
Jack.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.827
What is it?

34:24.863 --> 34:28.632
There may be more to mrs.
Walker's death than suicide.

34:28.767 --> 34:29.966
Her spine was pierced.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.169
- Pierced?
- Yes.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.338
With a filleting knife,
I'd imagine.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.240
Something a fishmonger
or a butcher would have.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.651
Latrine.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.386
Mr. Smith!

34:50.255 --> 34:51.388
(smith):
What do you want?

34:51.390 --> 34:53.790
My son needs to use
the latrine.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.758
Huh, tell him to hold it.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.092
I have been!

34:56.128 --> 34:58.195
Please.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.697
Or are you not man enough
to corral a small child?

35:06.638 --> 35:07.803
All right.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.677
No funny stuff.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.956
- Henry?
- Yes?

35:26.091 --> 35:27.757
I need you to go
back to the swamp.

35:27.793 --> 35:28.892
The swamp.
Why?

35:28.961 --> 35:31.628
I need to see if you can
find a knife somewhere near

35:31.630 --> 35:33.563
Where the body was found,
I'd imagine.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.165
What sort of knife?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.300
A murder weapon knife, henry.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.368
Sir.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.770
Llewelyn.

35:41.874 --> 35:43.440
Oh, hello.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.175
Have you thought more
about that party?

35:45.244 --> 35:47.510
I confess I have not.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.779
You've heard more about
your friend's wife.

35:50.448 --> 35:51.714
I have.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.316
And not good news?

35:53.318 --> 35:54.550
How can you tell?

35:55.587 --> 35:56.852
I can see it on your face.

35:57.656 --> 35:58.922
Well, you're right.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.524
It's not good news.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.559
Did he kill her?

36:06.064 --> 36:07.263
Why would you say that?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.133
Some peop...

36:11.136 --> 36:12.935
People in our position...

36:13.872 --> 36:15.538
Well, it is a hard
life to lead.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.874
Especially when
you're living a lie.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.743
Perhaps...

36:21.713 --> 36:23.613
Perhaps he needed an escape?

36:26.552 --> 36:29.485
The man I know
is not capable of murder.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.321
Please?

36:40.265 --> 36:41.498
You want to hurry it up?

36:46.271 --> 36:47.904
Hurry it up or I'm
going to come in there.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.042
(grunts)

36:53.912 --> 36:54.911
Harry!

36:56.215 --> 36:57.847
- Come out here!
- Father.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.081
Are you all right?

37:00.118 --> 37:02.052
- How many more are there?
- Just two.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.986
Shouldn't be much
of a problem for you.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.656
Oh, I appreciate
the confidence.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.330
Harry, stay right here.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.811
Drop your weapon.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.146
Toronto constabulary.
Drop your weapon!

37:32.084 --> 37:33.283
Ain't that special.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.950
Drop your weapon!

37:36.655 --> 37:37.620
No.

37:40.993 --> 37:42.892
Then I'll give you
a fighting chance.

37:51.637 --> 37:54.236
If all goes well,
I'll be needing you soon.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.840
Stay here.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.180
T want to think
about what happens next.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.115
I've never lost.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.584
How many duels have you had?

38:08.620 --> 38:09.919
- Two.
- Just two?

38:10.055 --> 38:11.987
But I lost neither one of
them.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.390
You want to count it down?

38:17.862 --> 38:20.396
All right.
Dealer's choice it is.

38:23.368 --> 38:24.401
One.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.206
Two--

38:31.476 --> 38:33.008
Wait! Ah!

38:40.719 --> 38:41.751
You cheated.

38:41.886 --> 38:44.321
You never said we
were counting to three.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.755
Ah!

38:48.827 --> 38:51.361
Father!
Is everything all right?

38:51.430 --> 38:53.028
Where were they keeping you?

39:08.646 --> 39:09.779
What are you doing?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.314
Clara was stabbed.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.885
We don't think
she took her own life.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.555
And I did it?

39:21.860 --> 39:23.559
Where's the missing
knife, jack?

39:25.764 --> 39:26.930
Get out.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.131
(watts):
Answer the question!

39:28.266 --> 39:29.933
I don't know.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.069
- I misplaced it.
- Well, you better find it.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.072
I can't believe you would
think this of me.

39:37.442 --> 39:41.211
Your reluctance to help me
is only fueling my suspicion.

39:41.346 --> 39:43.846
I don't give a damn what
it's fueling. Get out!

39:54.492 --> 39:55.291
Arthur.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.560
Arthur?

39:57.629 --> 39:58.761
Arthur!

39:59.731 --> 40:00.764
Are you all right?

40:02.134 --> 40:03.532
I'm lovely.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.035
You can't do this here.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.736
I didn't mean to.

40:08.874 --> 40:10.974
I must confess morpheus
got the better of me.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.175
Go home.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.978
- Come with me.
- No. I have work to do.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.647
I am your husband.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.348
I want you to come home.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.852
Right now, what you want is of
no concern to me.

40:23.721 --> 40:26.021
Violet, I will let you know

40:26.057 --> 40:28.190
That I am starting
to tire of this game.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.541
- Julia!
- (ogden): William!

40:46.611 --> 40:49.278
It seems I'm holding
your future in my hands.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.284
Detective, I hate swamps.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.353
I'm going to have to bathe
in calamine tonight.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.488
What did you find?

40:58.623 --> 41:01.324
Well, that is the good news.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.627
Good news for some, I suppose.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.365
Yes, thank you, henry.

41:10.501 --> 41:13.536
I'm sorry but you're
leaving me no choice.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.238
- Ahh!
- No!

41:16.441 --> 41:17.707
(screams)
(loud splash)

41:19.244 --> 41:20.243
Stay here!

41:22.514 --> 41:23.780
(groans)

41:25.550 --> 41:26.649
Julia?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.652
Julia.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.920
Are you all right?

41:31.923 --> 41:34.057
- I think I'm all right.
- And fellows?

41:34.059 --> 41:36.192
Oh, I don't know.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.065
I don't think he
fared too well.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.475
Whoever is in there
is made of stern stuff.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.211
Kicking up a storm.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.812
You don't have to
tell me that.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.314
I suppose not.

42:03.888 --> 42:05.087
Wow!

42:06.157 --> 42:08.358
Is that what was going
to happen to you?

42:08.493 --> 42:10.326
I suppose so.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.430
Wow.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.365
Quite the end
for mr. Fellows.

42:17.835 --> 42:18.767
Indeed.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.637
All right.
That's enough, harry.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.377
- Want to know something funny?
- All right.

42:28.580 --> 42:29.912
When I was with my mother,

42:31.182 --> 42:33.449
I spent my whole life running
from the black hand.

42:33.518 --> 42:34.883
How is that funny?

42:36.021 --> 42:38.754
I visit you two times
and I get kidnapped both.

42:40.392 --> 42:42.124
But, to be fair,
you ran away once.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.860
I'll give you that!
But I still got kidnapped.

42:44.862 --> 42:45.995
Fine.

42:46.064 --> 42:50.165
Well, you are a murdoch,
so every day's an adventure.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.337
He's gone!

42:54.406 --> 42:56.205
- He's gone!
- He's gone!

42:56.274 --> 42:57.539
Who?

42:57.576 --> 42:59.342
Samuel.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.676
Good lord.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.612
Jack walker just marched into
our home, and he just took him!

43:02.614 --> 43:04.480
I tried to stop him,
but he overpowered me.

43:04.616 --> 43:05.615
He stole our grandson.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.550
Also his son.

43:07.552 --> 43:08.751
He is not.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.753
Jack walker never
fathered that child.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.821
He has no claim to him!

43:11.823 --> 43:13.423
Well, that may not be exactly--

43:13.425 --> 43:14.891
Please, please, please!
Just stop talking.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.025
Please just go and find him,
please?

43:16.094 --> 43:17.226
Yes, yes.

43:18.830 --> 43:20.929
He's gone.
He's gone.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.367
(driver):
Hello, sir. Where to?

43:24.369 --> 43:26.035
Anywhere but here.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.704
Where specifically?

43:28.773 --> 43:29.805
Just drive.
