One week ago,</i>

02:19.881 --> 02:22.891

a newly unearthed stone feature</i>

<i>in the southeast corner

02:24.635 --> 02:28.305
<i>archaeologist Laird Niven
discovered pottery</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:30.473
<i>that was made
by Indigenous Mi'kmaq people</i>

02:30.558 --> 02:34.227
<i>between 500 and 2,500 years ago.</i>

02:34.729 --> 02:37.981
Basically,
Acadia First Nation got hold of

02:40.568 --> 02:42.411
<i>NARRATOR:
When Laird reported the finds</i>

02:42.570 --> 02:45.581
<i>to the provincial department of
Community, Culture and Heritage,</i>

02:45.740 --> 02:47.916
<i>he was given a stunning mandate</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:51.170
<i>to share with the Laginas

02:51.329 --> 02:53.922
The archeologists asked
that we stop down.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.010
I.E. you must cease and desist
immediately.

02:59.253 --> 03:02.589
<i>NARRATOR: Now, until an
assessment of both sites can be made</i>

03:02.682 --> 03:05.684
<i>by representatives of
the Indigenous authorities,</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:08.595
<i>the Oak Island team has agreed

03:11.933 --> 03:14.776
<i>also known as the buffer zones.</i>

03:15.937 --> 03:18.947
And so,
what we're constricted by is,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.533
we call this the center
of the circle, the buffer.

03:21.692 --> 03:25.445
- If we go out 120 feet all around...
- Mm.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.289
Is-is kind of the no-go zone.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.450
- Yes, exactly.
- That's the center?

03:30.543 --> 03:33.378
- LAIRD: Yeah.
- MARTY: What is this stone feature?

03:33.463 --> 03:36.798
Well, I think you can guess that
there's human-placed rock here.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.209
- It looks like it. Not as clear as that, honestly.
- IAN: Yeah. No.

03:39.293 --> 03:41.711
- LAIRD: No.
- IAN: But I think it's again some kind of attempt to,

03:41.804 --> 03:44.723
in the interface
between land and wetland,

03:44.807 --> 03:47.893
- produce a dry... a dry surface.
- A platform of some sort?

03:48.052 --> 03:51.054
Platform or possibly
even a continuation of a...

03:51.138 --> 03:53.899
To me, this looks like the pav--
The original paved area.

03:54.058 --> 03:56.726
- IAN: Yeah. - RICK: Quite irregular.
- MARTY: Me, too.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.979
This was an incredibly
active area.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.489
The stone road tells us that.

04:02.149 --> 04:05.735
<i>NARRATOR: Of the sites
affected by the new restrictions,</i>

04:05.828 --> 04:07.904
<i>perhaps the one that is
the most critical</i>

04:07.989 --> 04:09.990
<i>to Rick and Marty's
investigation is</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:13.001
<i>the mysterious stone road--
Or possible ship's wharf--</i>

04:13.160 --> 04:15.087
<i>First uncovered last year</i>

04:15.246 --> 04:16.922
<i>in the southeast corner
of the swamp.</i>

04:17.340 --> 04:19.249
This is one right here, too.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.001
GARY:
I think we found a barrel here.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.595
<i>NARRATOR: It was here,
over the past three weeks,</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:25.764
<i>that the team recovered
not only evidence</i>

04:25.923 --> 04:28.091
<i>of a possible shipping
operation,</i>

04:28.184 --> 04:31.177
<i>including parts of
cargo barrels and tools</i>

04:31.262 --> 04:33.939
<i>used to construct
wooden sailing vessels...</i>

04:34.098 --> 04:36.275
That right there could be
an outlet that heads

04:36.359 --> 04:38.026
- towards the Money Pit.
- Yeah.

04:38.185 --> 04:40.520
<i>But also a new stone feature</i>

04:40.613 --> 04:43.106
<i>which according to surveyor
Steve Guptill</i>

04:43.190 --> 04:44.866
<i>may be part of a pathway</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:47.035
<i>heading directly
toward the Money Pit.</i>

04:47.870 --> 04:49.371
I'm not surprised
to find evidence

04:49.455 --> 04:51.114
of the Mi'kmaq, uh,
on Oak Island.

04:51.198 --> 04:54.868
<i>But the stones are
really puzzling to me.</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:57.704
<i>I think we can discount
the Mi'kmaq from doing it.</i>

04:57.797 --> 05:00.957
<i>We have no record of them doing
anything like that.</i>

05:01.050 --> 05:03.209
<i>However,
we're not digging in there</i>

05:03.294 --> 05:04.886
<i>until we get clearance</i>

05:04.971 --> 05:06.221
from the Mi'kmaq
Rights Initiative

05:06.380 --> 05:07.964
and Community, Culture
and Heritage.

05:08.049 --> 05:10.383
Okay, well, we're gonna do
what's right.

05:10.468 --> 05:11.560
We're gonna continue to do
what's right.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.395
But we have to look after
our own rights, too.

05:13.554 --> 05:15.147
- Yeah.
- So, this has, this has thrown

05:15.306 --> 05:17.399
a major complication
into things, from my standpoint.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.151
Don't you agree?

05:19.235 --> 05:21.644
- Well, it certainly hampers the search.
- Yeah.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.897
Especially when
you're turning up all these...

05:23.990 --> 05:26.158
things that were relevant to us.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.660
<i>We're starting to find
some amazing things</i>

05:28.819 --> 05:30.829
<i>in the southeast corner
of the swamp.</i>

05:30.988 --> 05:33.165
<i>And all of a sudden,
now it's all shut down.</i>

05:33.249 --> 05:36.585
<i>We want to follow the law.
We will follow the law.</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:38.920
Being shut down in an area
that hasn't yet

05:39.080 --> 05:41.748
revealed all its secrets
is frustrating.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.177
<i>RICK: Because there are certain
areas now that are off limits,</i>

05:45.336 --> 05:47.921
<i>I think we have to
refocus and readjust</i>

05:48.014 --> 05:52.768
<i>and maybe look in areas
that previously we dismissed.</i>

05:52.927 --> 05:54.594
We'll just keep moving forward.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.439
There-There's no obstacle
that cannot be overcome.

05:57.598 --> 05:59.608
Okay, well, we'll deal with it.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.184
- All right.
- All right.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.520
<i>- Let's get after it.
- LAIRD: Yeah.</i>

06:03.604 --> 06:06.365
<i>NARRATOR: While Rick and Marty

<i>The fabled Money Pit

06:35.052 --> 06:37.887

- No. I've seen tighter.

06:37.972 --> 06:40.565
We're getting some of
those little marker horizons.

06:47.815 --> 06:49.983
<i>A borehole located in an area</i>

07:04.832 --> 07:07.884
<i>Traces of both silver and gold.</i>

07:09.086 --> 07:11.838
Pretty Mother Nature-ish.

TERRY:
D-1, still no tunnels.

07:36.530 --> 07:39.449
Our next run still has
the potential to hit,

07:39.542 --> 07:40.959
you know, uh,
some wood from a tunnel.

07:41.118 --> 07:43.620
We chased that tunnel right
across the north side of C-1.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.289
- Yep.
- And, I mean, this is, this is our depth where we brought up

07:46.373 --> 07:48.041
the iron that contains gold.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.211
That's right.
We're five feet away from D2.

07:51.795 --> 07:53.305
CHARLES:
There's something in here.

Yeah, looks like it.

a piece of metal</i>

08:03.149 --> 08:05.475
<i>from a depth of some 88 feet</i>

08:05.568 --> 08:07.611
<i>that contained
a significant amount of gold...</i>

08:08.821 --> 08:11.406

08:11.491 --> 08:14.409
<i>to as early as 1488.</i>

08:14.568 --> 08:16.069
How deep did you get, Adam?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.738
- 99.
- 99? Okay.

08:18.822 --> 08:20.749
More to come. 89 to 99.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.825
<i>NARRATOR:

08:31.761 --> 08:35.922
- What is that? That's 89.
- 89 feet.

08:36.006 --> 08:38.767
Just caught the edge
of something, it looks like.

08:40.261 --> 08:42.178
SCOTT:
Whoa!

08:42.271 --> 08:44.681
TERRY:
Interesting all the sudden. Wow.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.849
SCOTT:
We weren't expecting that.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.693
- That's more than one beam.
- Yep.

08:48.852 --> 08:52.355
Just by the initial looks,
I would say shaft.

08:52.439 --> 08:54.616
TERRY: It's a shaft
or a tunnel, for sure.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.277
We've hit a lot of tunnels
in and around the 90-foot mark.

08:57.361 --> 08:59.037
<i>NARRATOR:
A possible tunnel?</i>

08:59.196 --> 09:02.040
<i>Or a shaft some 90 feet deep
in the area</i>

09:02.199 --> 09:04.450
<i>where the team also
recently found evidence</i>

09:04.544 --> 09:05.961
<i>of silver and gold?</i>

09:07.380 --> 09:10.206
<i>Has the team once again
encountered an ancient tunnel</i>

09:10.291 --> 09:12.875
<i>that might be leading
to the original Money Pit?</i>

09:12.960 --> 09:16.638
<i>Or could it be
the Money Pit itself?</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:20.550
If it's a shaft, okay,
it's a very large shaft.

09:20.634 --> 09:22.644
If it's a tunnel,

09:22.728 --> 09:25.388
it matches very well
with our tunnel intersections

09:25.481 --> 09:28.057
- at 90 feet in the C-1 cluster.
- Yeah.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.402

10:04.020 --> 10:08.273
TERRY: We're thinking
possibly intersection of a tunnel,

10:08.357 --> 10:10.191
but we're leaning shaft.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.352
You're now in an area
where we had

10:12.436 --> 10:14.779
very little inclination that
there may be something up here.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.939
- Yes.
- Now we have empirical evidence

10:17.024 --> 10:18.116
- that there's something in this area.
- Yeah.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.526
- So, I think we have to continue.
- Yeah.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.280
<i>We certainly have found
man-made workings</i>

10:24.365 --> 10:26.041
<i>at the most northerly part of

10:26.200 --> 10:30.536
<i>So, on that basis alone,
it's significantly interesting.</i>

10:30.621 --> 10:34.215
The hope, of course,
is that it is original work

10:34.300 --> 10:36.709
and, thus, the implication
that we are near

10:36.794 --> 10:39.220
to a depositional target.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.139
We'll see where it goes.

Here, come show us.

13:48.902 --> 13:49.828
GARY:
It's got some heft to it.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.488
Um, to me,
it looks like a chisel.

13:52.573 --> 13:54.749
I-I don't believe it's a spike.

13:54.908 --> 13:56.742

CHARLES:
Yeah.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.249
Well, what would you use
a chisel like that for?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.928
It's hard to say, Jack,
what they were using it for.

14:07.087 --> 14:10.339
Yeah. To me, a chisel like that
is for doing the finer work.

14:10.424 --> 14:12.183
CHARLES: I agree with Bill
on that. It's not to break rocks.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.593
It's for detail work.

14:13.677 --> 14:15.436
- Yeah.
- This is a good candidate

14:15.521 --> 14:17.680

21:00.926 --> 21:02.593
MARTY:
This could be good.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.838
The unusual thing is
75 and a half feet

21:05.922 --> 21:08.766
because the tunnel horizon is
86 to 93.

21:08.925 --> 21:10.259

- So, what's that doing there?

21:10.343 --> 21:13.521

- RICK: I'm curious in the trace metals, right?
- KELLY: Sure.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.609
Because it may be a clue as to
how old the metal is itself.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.944
It's a very shallow depth,
though, 75 and a half feet.

22:44.104 --> 22:46.030
- That's great.
- Yeah.

22:46.114 --> 22:48.199
I've always felt
the most logical solution

22:48.358 --> 22:50.025
to this whole thing is
an offset chamber.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.860
I mean, how does a piece of iron

22:51.953 --> 22:54.455

get gold on it?

the most likely reason

of the Money Pit was as a decoy

23:37.082 --> 23:40.075

these two round,

small-ish rocks.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.406
Um, what is,

24:52.491 --> 24:54.158
<i>Well, when I first saw the rocks</i>

24:54.317 --> 24:55.734
I anticipated that
they were probably

24:55.818 --> 24:57.578
something that had been picked
up from a beach somewhere.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.154
But then, I got a chance
to look at them

24:59.239 --> 25:00.322
with a hand lens.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.992
<i>If there are small
green minerals in each one,</i>

25:04.085 --> 25:05.577
<i>um, my best guess is that</i>

25:05.662 --> 25:07.829
<i>these are actually
olivine bearing rocks.</i>

25:07.914 --> 25:10.082
And olivine gabbro
and an olivine basalt.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.252
<i>A basalt is a-a rock
that erupted volcanically,</i>

25:13.336 --> 25:14.762
and a gabbro is a rock that

25:14.846 --> 25:16.088
never quite made it
to the surface.

25:16.172 --> 25:20.175
Would that be likely
to be found on Oak Island?

25:20.268 --> 25:23.521
- Definitely not.
- Ah, I like that.

25:23.605 --> 25:27.266
And the composition of the rocks
are quite unusual

25:27.350 --> 25:29.193
for anything I would expect
to see here in Nova Scotia.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.104
Where else in the world
might they be?

25:32.188 --> 25:36.608
They form generally in, uh,
hot spot volcanic island chains.

25:36.701 --> 25:40.204
So something like the Azores
or the Canary Islands

25:40.363 --> 25:42.206
would be the obvious places,
I would think.

25:42.365 --> 25:46.034
And those two islands,
they're synonymous

25:46.119 --> 25:49.964
with transatlantic adventurers,

25:50.048 --> 25:51.966
conquistadores.

25:52.050 --> 25:56.303
- Yeah.
- Canary Islands, Spanish. Spain.

29:50.622 --> 29:51.955
It's hand-hewn.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.625
That's-- it's too thick
for dimensional, too. Right?

29:54.709 --> 29:58.212
<i>NARRATOR: A hand-hewn
or manually cut timber?</i>

29:58.296 --> 30:00.372
<i>Because mechanized

<i>in construction until
the late 18th century,</i>

30:07.222 --> 30:10.215

30:10.299 --> 30:12.643
<i>of the original Money Pit shaft?</i>

30:12.727 --> 30:15.470
<i>If so, what else might be
waiting to be found</i>

30:15.563 --> 30:18.482
<i>in the so-called
Dunfield spoils?</i>

30:18.566 --> 30:21.485
You mind if I poke around
down there a little bit?

30:21.569 --> 30:23.728
Just go around to the other end
and walk down that slope, right.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.780
JACK:
Okay.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.818
I'll come down there and detect.

30:29.902 --> 30:33.247
- 'Cause this is spoils just going all the way up.
- BILLY: Yep.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.074
Right. Now, if we do find
anything here...

30:36.167 --> 30:39.753
Yeah, a nail or anything would
be good to find here, Gary.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.506
(detector beeping)

30:45.009 --> 30:48.512
- You're getting a hit already?
- Yeah, it's in this.

30:51.257 --> 30:54.184
Is it that? Yep, it is.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.271
- JACK: Oh, wow.
- GARY: It's a cribbing spike.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.764
- Cribbing spike's a... Yeah.
- JACK: And that one's probably really old.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.851
I mean, anywhere where
we've been at a good depth,

31:02.935 --> 31:04.853
we find these older
cribbing spikes.

31:04.937 --> 31:07.439
And, of course,
we can have it tested...

31:07.523 --> 31:09.441
Mm-hmm.

31:09.534 --> 31:13.361
To see if it's, you know,
pre-1830s, 1840s.

31:13.446 --> 31:16.290
But it's got some heft to it
as well.

31:16.449 --> 31:18.867
That's a good point.

31:18.951 --> 31:21.119
<i>GARY: A cribbing
spike is an iron fastener</i>

31:21.212 --> 31:24.956
that was used to connect
two pieces of wood together.

<i>Normally associated
with tunnels or shafts.</i>

31:28.970 --> 31:30.795
This cribbing spike
could actually be

31:30.889 --> 31:34.975
part of the original
construction of the Money Pit.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.219
All right, mate, I'll put this
in my pouch and keep going.

31:38.304 --> 31:40.731

<i>on the mysterious metal artifact

32:16.935 --> 32:21.346
<i>at a depth of 75 feet
in borehole CD4.5.</i>

32:21.430 --> 32:25.266
It is rare for metal to come up
in these cores.

32:25.351 --> 32:26.526
<i>NARRATOR:
It is the team's hope</i>

32:26.611 --> 32:27.861
<i>that she can not only verify</i>

32:28.020 --> 32:29.437
<i>their initial findings</i>

32:29.522 --> 32:32.524
<i>that the object contains
a significant amount of gold</i>

32:32.608 --> 32:35.285
<i>but also identify
its country of origin.</i>

32:35.370 --> 32:37.371
MARTY:
So, today you have some results.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.948
Yeah, I found it interesting.

32:40.032 --> 32:42.292
I think you will find it
interesting as well.

32:42.451 --> 32:45.462
This is from CD4.5.
It was found at 75 feet.

32:45.546 --> 32:49.299
It's this funky,
little piece of metal.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.377
It's rare, and exceedingly rare,

32:52.470 --> 32:55.472
that we find any sort of metal
object in any of the cores.

32:55.556 --> 32:58.308
If you find it interesting,
certainly we will.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.555
So, yes, this is the breakdown
of the metal itself.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.650
So, it's an iron object.

33:06.809 --> 33:10.145
It does contain manganese
but just in one spot

33:10.229 --> 33:11.571
and in very high concentration,

33:11.656 --> 33:14.491
so, typically for me,
that's an indication

33:14.575 --> 33:16.735
that the manganese is original
to the ore body.

33:17.912 --> 33:21.665
But the really interesting part
of this particular object is

33:21.824 --> 33:24.292
that there are several
gold flakes on it.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.912
- Wow.
- (chuckles)

33:28.006 --> 33:29.423
CHRISTA: So, there's
about three or four large ones,

33:29.507 --> 33:31.925
and then there's
a few smaller ones.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.012
And so, they're very obvious
under the electron microscope.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.596
Um, so, of course,
right away that was

33:36.756 --> 33:37.848
really interesting to me.

33:38.007 --> 33:39.591
- That's why it was, uh...
- Yeah, I would say so.

33:39.675 --> 33:42.260
- But, um...
- (laughter)

33:42.353 --> 33:45.522
And so, the composition
of the gold flakes on this piece

33:45.681 --> 33:48.516
is very, very similar
to the composition

33:48.601 --> 33:52.612
of the gold flake
that you found on the object

33:52.697 --> 33:54.322
that had come out of D2.

33:58.527 --> 34:01.946
<i>NARRATOR:
The metal from borehole CD4.5,</i>

34:02.031 --> 34:03.948
<i>discovered 75 feet deep</i>

34:04.042 --> 34:06.710
<i>within a possible tunnel
in the Money Pit area,</i>

34:06.869 --> 34:09.963
<i>a near match to
the gold composition</i>

34:10.048 --> 34:14.468
<i>of that found in borehole D2,
some 15 feet deeper?</i>

34:14.627 --> 34:18.797
<i>If so, could Rick, Marty and
the team have found evidence</i>

34:18.881 --> 34:20.891
<i>that the actual design
of the Money Pit</i>

34:20.975 --> 34:24.227
<i>is even more complex
than anyone ever knew?</i>

34:25.396 --> 34:27.147
For there to be
a significant treasure

34:27.231 --> 34:29.149
where we've been drilling
all these boreholes

34:29.233 --> 34:31.401
seems far-fetched at this point.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.320
But if it's
in an offset chamber,

34:33.404 --> 34:35.405
which is what this is
kind of suggesting,

34:35.490 --> 34:37.232
then it makes sense.

34:37.316 --> 34:39.234
I-It makes sense
why it still might be there.

34:39.318 --> 34:42.320
It makes sense why
our predecessors didn't find it.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.081
It's exciting.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.574
Do you know
how they're adhered to it?

34:46.659 --> 34:49.086
- Are they stuck to it, or are they wedged?
- Yeah.

34:49.245 --> 34:51.663
They're stuck
into the-the metal itself.

34:51.747 --> 34:54.591
This, at some point, has been
transferred onto the surface.

34:56.418 --> 34:58.086
The thing that I found
even more interesting,

34:58.170 --> 35:00.430
because of course
I can look at composition,

35:00.589 --> 35:04.017
that gold and this gold
have essentially

35:04.102 --> 35:05.936
almost identical compositions.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.181
And so, historically,
the only thing that I could find

35:10.266 --> 35:13.110
that was, uh, from antiquity,

35:13.194 --> 35:16.521
high copper content
in gold artifacts,

35:16.605 --> 35:18.907
uh, is coming out of,
actually, South America.

35:20.526 --> 35:25.288
Oh.

35:25.447 --> 35:26.790
Wow.

35:26.949 --> 35:28.700
<i>NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,</i>

35:28.784 --> 35:30.451
<i>Dr. Christa Brosseau has just
presented a scientific report</i>

35:30.536 --> 35:32.879
<i>that the metal objects unearthed</i>

35:32.964 --> 35:37.709
<i>from boreholes CD4.5 and D2
in the Money Pit area</i>

35:37.793 --> 35:40.053
<i>not only contain
the same amount of gold</i>

35:40.138 --> 35:42.889
<i>but may also be
of South American origin.</i>

35:42.974 --> 35:45.884
CHRISTA:
And so, the composition here

35:45.977 --> 35:48.720
would be consistent
with a, like a 14 karat gold.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.731
It could be a rose gold.

35:51.891 --> 35:56.236
The high copper content is used
to make gold jewelry stronger.

35:56.395 --> 35:59.823
Does that mean that gold is
definitively worked by man?

35:59.907 --> 36:02.325
(stammers) It couldn't
be naturally occurring?

36:03.652 --> 36:06.246
I would not think
it's naturally occurring.

36:06.405 --> 36:10.000
MARTY: It's exciting that it
showed up on two different pieces.

36:10.084 --> 36:12.577
I looked and reached out
to these treasure hunters

36:12.661 --> 36:14.337
that are, um,
looking for the Spanish gold.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.831
Uh, when the Spanish
first arrived,

36:16.916 --> 36:19.083
they first started plundering
the artifacts

36:19.168 --> 36:21.428
that the Indigenous people had,

36:21.512 --> 36:23.013
and they often had var--

36:23.172 --> 36:24.848
Quite varying amounts of copper
in them.

36:25.007 --> 36:26.591
So, they melted it all down
and created

36:26.675 --> 36:29.102
what they called tumbaga bars.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.096
If they were mainly gold,
they called them gold bars.

36:32.181 --> 36:34.682
- So that was actually really exciting.
- Yeah.

36:34.767 --> 36:36.610
There is history
of the Spanish Conquistadors

36:36.769 --> 36:40.447
- like, yeah... (stammers) making these tumbaga bars.
- Yeah.

<i>as well as the one found

<i>used a lot of copper

and anticipation about what we
are about to proceed to do,

Absolutely.

38:13.615 --> 38:17.043

anything else better,

38:17.202 --> 38:21.715
short of a coin or-or something
indicative of possible treasure.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.875
- Yeah.
- MARTY: I would say that for sure.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.960
You know, it's-it's the thing
that keeps you going.

38:26.045 --> 38:28.546
