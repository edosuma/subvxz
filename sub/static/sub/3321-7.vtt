01:35.040 --> 01:39.512
Make way there!
Come on! Make way!
Make way!

02:09.280 --> 02:10.872
Brother!

02:13.960 --> 02:16.680
Brother! Where are you?

02:18.440 --> 02:20.397
Aethelwulf?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.036
Thank God
you are come.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.630
What on Earth made you
think I would not, sire?

02:28.720 --> 02:32.236
No, I never doubted you,
but others...

02:32.920 --> 02:36.152
Our own youngest
brother fled to Mercia.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.357
He was always
the runt of the litter.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.512
Our parents should've
drowned him at birth.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.393
Where are
the heathens now?

02:43.840 --> 02:45.877
Only one,
perhaps two days away.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.679
And your forces
are ready and armed?

02:47.760 --> 02:50.150
Yes, if you are
ready to lead them.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.797
I would regard it
a great honor, sire,

02:52.920 --> 02:54.991
to defend our kingdom
and our homeland.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.232
And there's no man better,
Lord Aethelwulf.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.915
The poets sing
your battle praises
in the halls.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.915
That's because I paid them.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.749
If you paid them,
they'd sing your praises too.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.274
That's poets for you.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.997
My Lady, pray,
have you no time
for laughter?

03:17.120 --> 03:20.796
No, My Lord Aethelwulf,
only for fear.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.472
How soon will
they come?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.993
Soon enough.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.316
I hope so.
I can't wait
for Valhalla.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.635
Good day to you, folk.
What is the problem here?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.473
The problem is her.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.156
What has she done?

04:27.240 --> 04:30.790
She has had a child,
the boy in her arms.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.155
What of it?

04:33.200 --> 04:35.032
He's not my child.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.354
We tried for many
years to have children
but without success.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.879
And then,
just over a year ago,
a young man came to the door.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.955
I remember the day.
I was making a loom.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.196
The young man said
his name was Ríg.

04:50.560 --> 04:55.032
He gave us some
good advice on our work
and stayed at our house.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.871
After three days,
he left,

04:57.960 --> 05:01.636
and then nine months later,
she gave birth to a son.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.313
Whose child is it?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.280
I do not know, My Lady.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.710
We were all
in the same bed.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.436
I was too scared...
You see? She is
not an honest woman.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.878
She had sex with Ríg

05:22.960 --> 05:26.112
and could not bring
herself to tell
me the truth!

05:30.440 --> 05:32.432
Do you know
who this Ríg was?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.359
No, he was
just a young man.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.755
On the contrary.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.837
We know from our
ancient stories

05:40.960 --> 05:44.317
that Ríg is another
name for Heimdall.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.350
The god Heimdall?
My Lady!

05:48.440 --> 05:50.671
Yes, the god Heimdall!

05:51.560 --> 05:54.837
You are fortunate
that he chose your
household to appear in.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.240
That's just a story.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.755
Our whole lives
are just stories.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.476
You should be ashamed
you did not trust your wife,

06:01.840 --> 06:04.560
despite the joy and comfort
she has brought you,

06:04.720 --> 06:08.953
and the fact
that a god chose you
of all people to visit.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.118
Do not punish her,

06:13.560 --> 06:17.110
but rejoice with her,
drink wine with her,

06:17.680 --> 06:21.117
and sacrifice
one of your animals
to Heimdall, the god.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.559
But if I hear you
have harmed this woman
or this child,

06:29.320 --> 06:31.789
you will answer
for it to me.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.156
It seems
they intend to stay
here a while.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.832
I had not expected that.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.798
My Lord,
why don't we attack?

07:06.440 --> 07:07.840
They have
a strong position.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.593
Perhaps if we can
make them leave their
position and attack us.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.559
How could we
force them to do that?

07:14.760 --> 07:17.195
They're scavengers,
little more than beasts.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.272
We must be able
to out-think them.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.353
If we leave it
much longer, they'll be
even better dug-in.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.716
My Lord, if a wolf comes
into your sheep fold,

07:24.800 --> 07:26.280
you don't try to out-think it.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.671
You go in and drive
it away or kill it!

07:28.800 --> 07:30.553
How dare you
argue with me?

07:30.640 --> 07:32.359
Lord Aethelwulf, forgive us.
We only meant...

07:32.840 --> 07:34.069
I know what you meant.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.880
You meant that you're
already greater warriors
than I am,

07:37.040 --> 07:38.554
although only yesterday
you were still green,

07:38.640 --> 07:40.154
sucking on your
mothers' breasts.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.471
Go do your jobs.
Set up camp.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.871
You see them up there?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.231
Yes, I can see them.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.757
What're we waiting for?

08:00.520 --> 08:02.716
To see what they'll do.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.274
So you want to hand
them the initiative?

08:07.920 --> 08:12.551
We can't afford to lose
half our men by being
stupid and attacking.

08:14.080 --> 08:17.676
We wait until the odds
are in our favor.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.517
Ah...

09:30.280 --> 09:33.079
Awake! Awake!
Under attack!

09:35.880 --> 09:36.870
Arm yourselves!

09:37.000 --> 09:37.990
Rise! Rise!

09:42.080 --> 09:43.560
Throw! Throw!

09:56.160 --> 09:57.753
Odin!

10:00.840 --> 10:03.400
They're on us! Weapons!

10:19.160 --> 10:21.356
My Lord!
We're being attacked!

10:39.760 --> 10:41.240
Amen.

11:13.160 --> 11:13.911
Who are you?

11:16.720 --> 11:20.600
I'm Lord Aethelwulf,
brother of King Aelle.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.274
You are the brother
of the King, yet you
lead his army?

11:25.840 --> 11:26.830
Hmm.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.071
Does he send you to
fight all his battles?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.078
In the bedroom too?

11:38.120 --> 11:41.272
Ragnar! Come and see!

11:42.160 --> 11:46.473
Their iron is stronger
and better than ours.

11:47.080 --> 11:50.710
And we've
captured a dozen
of their horses.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.352
I'm hungry already.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.439
What ails you, my friend?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.076
The gods won't
lift my curse.

11:59.320 --> 12:03.234
I am fated to live forever
on this miserable Earth.

12:11.840 --> 12:12.876
Who is this?

12:13.280 --> 12:14.316
This?

12:14.720 --> 12:17.235
This is
the King's brother.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.519
What do you say?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.237
Shall we go
visit the King?

12:24.320 --> 12:27.154
God help us!
My brother defeated, dead.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.118
God help Northumbria.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.351
Sire, we do not know
if your brother is dead.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.553
But we do know, My Lord,
that he was defeated!

12:37.720 --> 12:40.872
Who are these barbarians,
these savages?

12:41.520 --> 12:44.274
Why have they
come to torment us?

12:44.360 --> 12:47.000
Sire, some learned
and wise men say

12:47.120 --> 12:50.397
that these Northmen have
been sent here by God...

12:50.480 --> 12:54.599
To punish our people
for their many sins
and transgressions.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.875
That we have departed
from the path
of righteousness

12:57.960 --> 13:02.079
that our lord set out,
so now he is holding
us to terrible account.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.639
Forgive me, sire,

13:07.720 --> 13:11.634
but what if God has not
sent these Northmen
here to plague us?

13:13.200 --> 13:14.554
Then who has, pray?

13:14.840 --> 13:18.072
Could it not, sire,
rather be the work
of the devil?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.120
Go on then, My Lord.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.080
What is your advice?

13:23.480 --> 13:27.360
My advice, sire, is that,
as we are facing
the forces of Satan,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.711
we must resist
them at all costs.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.875
Even at the cost
of all our lives
if necessary.

13:35.200 --> 13:40.229
For evil cannot be
accommodated nor yet
ever bargained with.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.073
Aye!

13:44.240 --> 13:46.914
Sire, if I might speak?

13:47.760 --> 13:50.320
I put it to you
that it might be

13:50.400 --> 13:53.120
that these
pagans have come here
by their own account,

13:53.440 --> 13:56.911
that they are
neither of God
nor the devil.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.591
They are just savage men

13:59.680 --> 14:03.913
more interested in robbery
and plunder than in
matters of the spirit.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.957
Then what is your advice?
Listen to him.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.680
Sire, since they
have come for gain,

14:08.760 --> 14:13.391
then let us offer them
enough money or whatever
else they desire

14:13.480 --> 14:16.154
to go away and
leave us in peace!

14:16.440 --> 14:20.593
Shame! Shame on you!
Shame on you!

14:20.880 --> 14:25.033
He is right!
Why waste more blood?

14:26.080 --> 14:27.833
Let's pay them off!
Foolish!

14:28.840 --> 14:32.629
My Lords, let me think
on it just a little while.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.874
In the meantime,
let it be known

14:36.960 --> 14:40.158
I have sent envoys out
to raise more men to arms

14:40.240 --> 14:42.516
for our use if need be.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.551
Long live the King!

14:55.320 --> 15:00.315
Contend, O Lord,
against those who
contend with me.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.630
Fight against those
who fight against me.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.552
Draw the spear and javelin
against my pursuers.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.319
Say to my soul,
"I am your salvation."

15:20.480 --> 15:23.632
Sire, they are here.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.880
Greetings.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.836
King Aelle invites your
leader to meet him
in his villa to talk.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.719
Who is your leader?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.315
The King did not know
that his brother
was still alive.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.920
He would like to talk
to you about what
he can give you

16:33.360 --> 16:35.317
to set his brother free.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.920
Do you accept
the King's invitation?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.751
Where are you going?

17:07.040 --> 17:10.317
We should attack
while they are weak.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.152
How long will it take them
to raise another army?

17:13.240 --> 17:17.119
"Attack,
attack, attack!"
That's all he ever says.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.633
I want to talk
to the King.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.950
What is
there to talk about?

17:23.359 --> 17:26.637
Imagine the treasures
the King keeps
in his household.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.680
I want them.

17:28.760 --> 17:33.471
I want to see how he lives,
what manner of men they are,

17:34.600 --> 17:35.795
and I'm hungry.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.269
Listen to me,

17:37.360 --> 17:39.875
if we agree to
walk into his house,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.552
he can kill each
and every one of us.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.394
You forget,
we hold his brother hostage.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.596
Why should he care
about his brother?

17:50.840 --> 17:53.036
Do I not care
about mine?

18:27.080 --> 18:29.117
They're coming.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.358
My Lord Eadric.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.596
Sire, this man
is Ragnar Lothbrok,

19:46.120 --> 19:48.112
his brother Rollo,

19:48.200 --> 19:49.714
and their companions.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.759
Ah, yes, Ragnar Lothbrok.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.196
We've heard
that name before.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.353
We are pleased
you have decided
to talk to us.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.431
Perhaps, sire,
you should invite
them to eat first.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.880
Forgive me.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.715
Let us feast
together and then talk.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.995
The King!

20:52.520 --> 20:53.840
Ragnar Lothbrok,

20:54.680 --> 20:58.913
may I present
my wife, Ealswith,
and my son, Egbert.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.710
Hello.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.710
Go on now.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.430
We need more.

21:42.080 --> 21:47.314
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.951
Amen.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.793
Shall we talk, King?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.110
Very well.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.799
What do you want

23:10.880 --> 23:14.794
for the safe
return of my brother
and for leaving my kingdom?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.474
Is he a priest?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.119
He's a bishop
of our church,

23:22.680 --> 23:24.034
a man of God.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.360
I, too, have a man
of God at home.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.959
Two thousand pounds
in gold and silver.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.396
What did
he say?

23:35.480 --> 23:36.675
How much?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.993
Two thousand pounds.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.797
I do not think
I heard you properly,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.110
Hmm.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.790
Two thousand pounds
in weight.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.919
That is the price.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.797
I agree to the terms.

24:24.840 --> 24:25.910
Good.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.593
But first, you must
return my brother.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.758
When we receive payment,
you shall have your brother.

24:44.520 --> 24:48.150
You must give me
time to collect such
a vast amount.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.794
And in the meantime,

24:53.200 --> 24:56.238
you and your men
must remain in your camp

24:56.440 --> 25:00.832
and make no further
attacks on my people
or their property.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.834
Agreed.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.754
Sire! How can we trust
the word of a pagan?

25:09.680 --> 25:11.751
Let me baptize
one of them.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.835
There is one
further condition.

25:16.280 --> 25:19.352
I desire that either you
or one of your companions

25:19.440 --> 25:21.875
agrees to be
baptized into our faith.

25:23.120 --> 25:27.034
That way, I can make peace
with a friend and
fellow Christian,

25:27.400 --> 25:28.959
and not an enemy.

25:29.080 --> 25:33.279
You want one of us
to become Christian?
Yes.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.795
Tostig!

26:00.600 --> 26:04.310
I will be Christian.

26:25.320 --> 26:26.356
My Lady Lagertha,

26:26.480 --> 26:27.834
I hope you can
find it in your heart

26:27.920 --> 26:30.037
to speak to the wife
of the late Earl.

26:30.320 --> 26:33.631
Of course. Hello, Siggy.
Please sit down and join us.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.475
Wait! Earl Haraldson
tried to kill my father.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.269
I know.
And if he had succeeded,

26:44.640 --> 26:47.280
I would be standing
where Siggy's standing now.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.154
So what would you
like me to say to her?

26:56.560 --> 26:59.519
I would ask her
to sit down.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.120
Thank you.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.074
What can I do for you?

27:13.520 --> 27:14.874
It is what I can
do for you.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.274
I want to serve you.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.917
That is not necessary.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.151
I remember very well
how I served
the father of my church,

27:35.000 --> 27:36.639
and it did me no harm.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.509
In fact, I found in service
a great freedom and honor.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.120
When I accepted
that I should
forget about myself

27:44.200 --> 27:46.351
and serve Father Cuthbert,

27:47.720 --> 27:51.077
well, then I became happy.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.757
If it's really what you want,
I accept your offer.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.993
Thank you.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.595
You and your daughter
are now under my protection,

28:19.200 --> 28:21.715
but I will never
treat you as a servant.

28:36.640 --> 28:40.395
O Lord, Holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,

28:40.960 --> 28:44.840
expel the devil and
his kin from this person,

28:45.080 --> 28:48.915
from the head, from the hair,
from the brain, from the brow,

28:49.360 --> 28:51.317
from the ears,
from the nostrils,

28:51.400 --> 28:53.790
from the mouth,
from beneath the tongue,

28:54.640 --> 28:56.359
from the throat,
from the neck,

28:56.440 --> 28:58.113
from the chest,
from the heart,

28:58.200 --> 29:00.635
from the entire
interior of the body,

29:01.560 --> 29:05.110
from the thoughts,
from the words,
and from the deeds,

29:05.320 --> 29:08.313
in the name of
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.315
Amen.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.354
I anoint thee

29:16.200 --> 29:21.639
in the name of the Father
and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.829
Amen.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.277
I now pronounce
you baptized and born again

29:39.360 --> 29:42.194
with the new
Christian name of Rolf.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.718
May the Lord
bless you and keep you

29:55.800 --> 29:57.917
from this day
hence and forever.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.270
Amen.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.394
We have witnessed
a true miracle.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.553
Now I ask you to
fulfill your promises.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.673
Return to your ships
and await your
payment in peace.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.434
Agreed, Ragnar Lothbrok?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.194
What is it?

31:06.440 --> 31:07.920
I can't sleep.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.516
Come here
beside me, daughter.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.793
What worries you?

31:24.880 --> 31:28.556
I fear for father
so far away.

31:34.240 --> 31:38.234
Our lives are fated, Gyda.
We all have to accept that.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.638
I can feel it moving
underneath my hand.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.793
Mmm-hmm.
He has a strong kick.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.400
He? Are you
so sure it's a boy?

31:57.240 --> 31:59.994
A long time ago,
the Seer prophesized

32:00.080 --> 32:02.675
that your father
would have many sons.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.957
That's how I know
it's a boy.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.034
Now sleep.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.353
I won again.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.952
Well done, Rolf.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.632
What's wrong
with you, Floki?

32:48.720 --> 32:50.951
There's nothing
wrong with me.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.632
I did not renounce the gods
in front of everyone.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.753
It was a joke.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.393
I didn't believe it.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.634
I didn't even know what
the old fool was saying.

33:03.720 --> 33:07.714
It doesn't matter.
Surely, you've made
them very angry.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.234
Don't be stupid.

33:16.320 --> 33:21.679
No, you are the
stupid one to risk
the wrath of the gods.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.513
How will you ever get Odin
to forgive you now?

33:28.600 --> 33:30.910
They're here!
Come and see!

34:25.080 --> 34:26.560
They're empty.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.880
Move back!

35:30.480 --> 35:31.470
Reform!

35:34.480 --> 35:35.550
My men!

35:35.720 --> 35:36.836
Regroup!

36:38.840 --> 36:39.956
Odin!

37:37.400 --> 37:39.790
Valhalla.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.874
How many Christians
did I kill, Floki?

38:47.640 --> 38:49.120
How many?

38:51.240 --> 38:55.075
Do you think Odin
is still angry
with me now?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.070
Whoo!

39:16.280 --> 39:19.239
It seems your brother,
the King,

39:20.600 --> 39:23.035
does not care if
you live or die.

39:25.280 --> 39:29.433
If you let me talk to him,
I will persuade him
to honor his pledge.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.435
Why should I not
just kill you now?

39:51.720 --> 39:54.554
Then you'll have nothing
left to bargain with.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.792
I have this.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.954
Open!

40:17.680 --> 40:19.160
Open the gate!

42:04.760 --> 42:07.594
I swear
before God almighty,

42:07.680 --> 42:13.074
I declare war eternal
on the Northman,
Ragnar Lothbrok.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.759
I swear to our
Lord Jesus Christ
and to the Blessed Virgin,

42:18.960 --> 42:23.000
one day, I will
avenge myself on him

42:24.200 --> 42:27.477
and bring him to
justice and to death,

42:27.800 --> 42:29.712
so help me God.
