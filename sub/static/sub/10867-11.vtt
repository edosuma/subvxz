00:32.784 --> 00:35.661
These are the best
cookies I ever ate...

00:35.661 --> 00:37.162
ever.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.456
Grandma Aggie made 'em.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.874
Old family recipe.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.626
Doesn't chocolate
give you pimples?

00:41.626 --> 00:44.003
Who cares?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.819
Uh oh.

01:07.819 --> 01:09.236
What?

01:09.236 --> 01:10.822
I feel...
gross.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.824
I think I ate about
six too many.

01:12.824 --> 01:14.116
Wimps!

01:14.116 --> 01:16.243
Not you too?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.496
What's in the bottom ones?
Lead?

01:18.496 --> 01:21.540
No!
They're all the same.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.298
The trouble is, too
much of a good thing...

01:29.298 --> 01:31.467
isn't always such a good thing.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.887
I got a story about a guy
who has a dream come true.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.097
He gets so much of a good
thing, that it's going to

01:37.097 --> 01:39.350
change his life.

01:39.350 --> 01:43.395
But if he's not careful, those
changes might make his dream

01:43.395 --> 01:45.064
come true...

01:45.064 --> 01:50.152
turn into a nightmare.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.948
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:53.948 --> 01:57.451
I call this story...

02:10.130 --> 02:12.758
Uh-hhhh...

02:23.394 --> 02:25.312
Well, this is your lucky day!

02:25.312 --> 02:28.524
I have just one vial of the
egyptian youth potion left.

02:28.524 --> 02:33.071
Of course it's very rare and
the price will go up...

02:33.071 --> 02:34.613
Ahhh!

02:34.613 --> 02:38.283
Don't be scared
Sardo, it's me, it's me,

02:38.283 --> 02:39.869
Bobo.

02:39.869 --> 02:43.915
Bobo? You look
so... so... thin.

02:43.915 --> 02:45.457
Have you been working out?

02:45.457 --> 02:48.502
Uh- little bad luck...
you know how it is.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.754
Really?

02:49.754 --> 02:52.757
Yeah.
Sardo, I need your help.

02:52.757 --> 02:55.384
Well, anything I can do...

02:55.384 --> 02:57.803
I need money...
almost anything.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.221
I distinctly said almost.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.514
Is it getting warm in here?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.601
Sardo, Sardo, I
don't want your charity.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.228
I have something for you.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.313
What is it?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.274
What is it you ask.

03:10.274 --> 03:16.781
Well...
it is, an ancient...

03:16.781 --> 03:20.242
fortune telling...
box.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.079
Really? How does it work?

03:23.079 --> 03:28.000
I don't know, but, I'm sure
someone of your experience,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.962
someone with your brain
size is going to be able

03:30.962 --> 03:33.005
to make a small
fortune with this.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.507
Well, of course...

03:35.507 --> 03:37.426
How much do you want for it?

03:37.426 --> 03:39.553
Um- Fifty dollars.
Fifty??

03:39.553 --> 03:41.764
I mean 40 For
you my friend, $40.

03:41.764 --> 03:43.432
That's too rich
for my blood Bobo.

03:43.432 --> 03:44.682
Free!

03:46.144 --> 03:48.228
You sell it for
what you can, and

03:48.228 --> 03:50.564
you give me what
you think is fair.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.816
Eh...

03:51.816 --> 03:55.820
Sardo, how can you go wrong?

03:55.820 --> 03:56.780
Give it.

03:58.864 --> 04:02.076
Oh!
(laughs)

04:08.791 --> 04:11.335
And this is funny because...?
(laughs)

04:11.335 --> 04:13.004
Oh, this
is funny because

04:13.004 --> 04:15.881
you finally are
losing on the deal!

04:39.864 --> 04:43.993
Hahahahaha...
Loser.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.790
I hate this game.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.221
Hi Andrea?

05:03.221 --> 05:04.680
Hi Jason.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.850
Yeah, uh- I was...
um- I was wondering if like...

05:07.850 --> 05:10.435
uh-if you aren't doing
anything Friday like...

05:10.435 --> 05:14.356
you might um- wanna...
[bell rings]

05:16.275 --> 05:18.861
I, I gotta go.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.809
Hiding from someone?

05:50.809 --> 05:52.061
Uh-No.

05:52.061 --> 05:54.063
Um...

05:54.063 --> 05:56.065
Yes.
Uh-I'm sorry.

05:56.065 --> 05:59.151
Ah, wait!
I can see you're the shy type.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.485
Trouble with the ladies?

06:00.485 --> 06:04.698
Uh... Yeah... sort of.
A-ha!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.909
And what you lack is
confidence, am I right?

06:06.909 --> 06:08.368
Um- I... I guess.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.704
A-ha! (giggle) Then I have
exactly what you need.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.290
Uh-you...
you do?

06:12.290 --> 06:15.417
Yes! You see, confidence
comes from experience.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.544
And experience comes from age.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.339
And age comes from...

06:20.339 --> 06:22.049
age comes from...

06:22.049 --> 06:23.884
well from THIS!

06:23.884 --> 06:26.553
An egyptian
aging potion.

06:26.553 --> 06:30.182
Two tiny drops of this and
you'll instantly become a more

06:30.182 --> 06:33.060
mature confident person!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.146
I don't wanna be
older, I just...

06:35.146 --> 06:38.316
I wanna have the
guts to talk to girls.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.985
Of course you do!
Of course you do!

06:40.985 --> 06:43.988
Then what you need is uh
something more like...

06:43.988 --> 06:47.532
like... like this!

06:47.532 --> 06:49.327
What, what is... this?

06:49.327 --> 06:51.453
Uh-well...This is a...

06:51.453 --> 06:52.830
it's a...

06:52.830 --> 06:54.165
a hand...

06:54.165 --> 06:55.582
a HANDsome...

06:55.582 --> 06:56.834
a HANDsome...

06:56.834 --> 07:00.087
a HANDsome Persian...

07:00.087 --> 07:02.298
victory box.

07:02.298 --> 07:05.509
Persian victory box?

07:05.509 --> 07:07.178
Yes.

07:07.178 --> 07:10.639
Uh-Warriors for centuries
have used this to give them

07:10.639 --> 07:13.767
the confidence to do battle.

07:13.767 --> 07:18.105
Imagine what it could
do for your love life!

07:18.105 --> 07:19.690
O-kay...

07:19.690 --> 07:23.194
Uh - how - how does - how
does - how does it work?

07:23.194 --> 07:27.365
Um- you put your hand,
your hand uh-on top of it,

07:27.365 --> 07:29.616
right there, and
then you ask it for...

07:29.616 --> 07:31.535
whatever it is you want.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.163
And then bang!

07:34.163 --> 07:36.707
You shall have it.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.084
Lemme try.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.880
Ahhhh, but you know, confidence
like this doesn't come cheap.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.132
Well, what if I, uh-I
don't believe it works?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.551
Now then...
maybe it will come cheap.

07:54.850 --> 07:58.187
Hey mom!
I'm home!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.208
Uh...

08:19.208 --> 08:24.755
I wish that I was the
kind of guy that girls like.

08:29.260 --> 08:34.097
Hey, dinner's ready.
What're you doing?

08:34.097 --> 08:37.268
Wasting my time.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.576
Hi!

08:54.576 --> 08:55.416
Uh, Hi.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.711
Hey like, what do you want?

09:04.711 --> 09:09.091
(giggles) Um-It's what YOU want.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.759
What?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.719
You wished to be the kind
of guy girls like, right?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.305
Well, when they
see you with me,

09:14.305 --> 09:16.223
they're gonna think
you're pretty special.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.976
Isn't he a babe? (giggles)

09:18.976 --> 09:21.353
Would.. would you stop!

09:21.353 --> 09:23.688
How...how did you know I wished?
It's what I do.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.067
I'm...
I'm Belle.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.486
Ready for some fun?

09:28.486 --> 09:30.488
But... what? I..I
don't understand?

09:30.488 --> 09:32.656
The box.
The Zemi.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.409
It's yours now. Whatever
you wish, I can deliver.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.288
Just uh...
leave me alone.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.594
What's the matter?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.887
You're in this class?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.598
I am now. What's the trouble?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.393
The trouble is I've got a book
report on "Treasure Island"

10:01.393 --> 10:06.190
due today that I of
course left at home.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.233
Look in your pack.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.653
I already looked in my pack.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.991
You're welcome.

10:18.118 --> 10:23.248
Report time, let's
start with... Jason.

10:27.294 --> 10:31.756
Uh..er...-I-uh- did my
report on "Treasure Island,

10:31.756 --> 10:34.885
by Robert Louis Stevenson."

10:34.885 --> 10:38.305
Uh-There have been many versions
of Treasure Island my personal

10:38.305 --> 10:40.682
favorite was the old
black and white one.

10:40.682 --> 10:44.395
The one with the puppets
was kind of stupid..."

10:44.395 --> 10:47.064
You were supposed to do a
book report not a movie review.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.857
Yes...

10:48.857 --> 10:51.527
Did you read the book?
Uh, yeah.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.404
Then why did you
write about the movies?

10:53.404 --> 10:59.326
I'm... gonna have to get
back to you on that one.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.413
Come by after school and
we'll straighten you out.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.632
Oh, leave me alone.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.926
Why?
This is fun.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.886
What're you doing now?

11:17.886 --> 11:19.388
Well I'm about to
be embarrassed.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.932
You might not want to see this.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.085
Hey, easy man!

12:07.144 --> 12:09.854
You're meat!

12:24.161 --> 12:24.881
Uh oh!

12:27.581 --> 12:30.167
So?
What's a little detention?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.460
You were great!

12:31.460 --> 12:32.836
Try a DOUBLE detention.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.254
English and Gym.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.880
I nearly could
have killed the guy!

12:35.880 --> 12:37.716
I mean, how
did you even do that?

12:37.716 --> 12:38.967
I told you, the Zemi.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.427
Whatever you want
I can give you.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.928
What's a Zemi?

12:41.928 --> 12:45.432
The box! You put your hand
on it and made a wish...

12:45.432 --> 12:47.392
that makes it yours.

12:47.392 --> 12:51.563
So you're a... genie?

12:51.563 --> 12:52.523
Exactly!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.860
And anything I
wish for I can have?

12:56.860 --> 12:58.195
Now you got it.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.238
Well, I wish
I didn't miss the bus

13:00.238 --> 13:01.740
cuz now I gotta walk home.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.867
No you don't.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.248
Uh - Is this your car?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.792
No. It's yours.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.891
Let's roll.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.395
Oh no!

13:31.395 --> 13:33.938
Oh man I just got my
license last week.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.857
Let's see your license
and registration please.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.694
Uh- yes sir!
Where's the registration?

13:38.694 --> 13:41.946
I don't know.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.824
What do you mean you don't know?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.411
Isn't this your car?

13:47.411 --> 13:50.789
They think it was stolen!

13:50.789 --> 13:53.751
I'm in jail now!

13:53.751 --> 13:58.338
How am I ever gonna
explain this to my parents??

13:58.338 --> 14:01.675
(giggle) Yeah,
that should be fun.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.995
Fun? Fun???

14:07.681 --> 14:09.641
What kind of genie are you?

14:09.641 --> 14:13.729
Like you give me what I wish
for but then things end up

14:13.729 --> 14:15.606
worse off than
they were before.

14:15.606 --> 14:18.275
Every wish has it's price.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.068
What???

14:20.068 --> 14:22.404
Look, I've been stuck in
that dumb box for centuries.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.697
I gotta have fun somehow.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.156
So you make things worse??

14:25.156 --> 14:26.658
Sure, it's fun!

14:26.658 --> 14:28.660
Okay look.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.371
Someone once wished for
an exciting voyage...

14:31.371 --> 14:32.790
I gave them the Titanic.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.208
A kid didn't want to
go on a camping trip...

14:35.208 --> 14:38.587
I exploded the volcano
at Mount Saint Helens.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.464
World War One?

14:40.464 --> 14:43.801
A reporter wanted an
interesting story.

14:43.801 --> 14:46.094
So, like uh...

14:46.094 --> 14:47.596
World War Two?

14:47.596 --> 14:50.808
Oh yeah...
No, wasn't mine.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.183
Nice work though.

14:52.183 --> 14:55.061
Oh, this is crazy!

14:55.061 --> 14:58.816
Nah, we're just
getting warmed up.

14:58.816 --> 15:01.819
Go on, wish for something...

15:01.819 --> 15:04.112
but be careful.

15:04.112 --> 15:09.785
Alright, uh- here's
your wish, leave me alone!

15:16.166 --> 15:17.416
What?

15:18.502 --> 15:20.211
Okay, I get it.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.548
I get it. I'm alone
now. I'm alone.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.800
Well like...

15:24.800 --> 15:27.135
would you get me
outta of here, please!

15:27.135 --> 15:30.930
Where am I?
I'm nowhere.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.475
Get me outta here!!!!

15:35.727 --> 15:38.689
Help! Genie! Belle!

15:38.689 --> 15:42.901
Whatever your name is.

15:42.901 --> 15:48.114
Alright.
I wish I was back with you!

15:53.077 --> 15:55.831
Why don't you go
back to your uh...

15:55.831 --> 16:01.127
lamp, or uh-box
or whatever it is?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.755
Sorry.
It's like a prison in there.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.590
When I get the chance
to get out and work

16:05.590 --> 16:07.133
with someone, I take it.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.094
What if I wished you back?
-I might take you with me.

16:10.094 --> 16:15.559
Is that allowed?
-Try me.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.062
But you gotta do
what I wish, right?

16:19.062 --> 16:20.647
Yup.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.860
Go for it wish-boy, but
choose your words carefully.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.540
Okay.
I wish...

16:29.573 --> 16:33.243
I was back at that Magic
Shop where this all started.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.430
Uh oh.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.134
You! You.
What's your name?

16:50.134 --> 16:53.346
It's Sar... let's not go there.
What can I do for you?

16:53.346 --> 16:56.892
That, that... Persian
Victory Box you sold me...?

16:56.892 --> 16:58.184
I'm sorry I don't remember.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.811
So much time has
actually passed ...

16:59.811 --> 17:01.479
It was yesterday!

17:01.479 --> 17:04.232
Oh the persian Victory box.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.693
Hey, what seems
to be the problem?

17:06.693 --> 17:09.237
The problem is it
came with a girl.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.655
And that's a problem?

17:10.655 --> 17:12.365
She's a genie!

17:12.365 --> 17:17.369
She makes wishes come true
and I don't want it anymore!

17:17.369 --> 17:19.705
Help me to understand this.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.877
I sold you a box that came with
a genie that will grant your

17:23.877 --> 17:27.923
every wish, and you
don't want it anymore?

17:27.923 --> 17:28.883
Exactly!

17:30.884 --> 17:32.719
Perfectly understandable!

17:32.719 --> 17:37.015
I tell you what, you show
me where it is and I'll

17:37.015 --> 17:39.309
gladly take an exchange...

17:39.309 --> 17:42.896
but no cash, store
credit only, right?

17:42.896 --> 17:45.189
I left it right...

17:45.189 --> 17:47.275
Honey?
Who's your friend?

17:47.275 --> 17:50.111
Hey mom!
Uh-This is mister...um

17:50.111 --> 17:53.239
Sardo. No mister,
accent on the do.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.409
Uh, yeah... He's...
a teacher.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.370
He's helping me with-uh...

17:59.370 --> 18:01.289
current events.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.624
Good.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.250
I'll leave you two alone.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.543
Nice cape.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.671
Hahaha...

18:08.755 --> 18:11.008
Where's the box?

18:15.136 --> 18:17.263
It's not that easy Jason.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.599
Who's this?
The Genie.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.351
Oh, hello.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.644
What do you mean?

18:22.644 --> 18:25.480
he wants it, huh, he
can have the wishes.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.398
But he gave it up.
He can't take it back.

18:27.398 --> 18:30.027
Why not?
Rules. I don't make 'em up.

18:32.278 --> 18:36.282
Oh man, I wish I was
out of this nightmare.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.002
Uh oh.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.453
How...
how did you do that???

18:40.453 --> 18:43.665
Oh no!
No, no, no!

18:43.665 --> 18:46.543
I wished to be out of this
nightmare. Now I am!

18:46.543 --> 18:48.503
Oh, everything's changed.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.254
Did I hear voices...?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.673
AHHHH!

18:51.673 --> 18:55.343
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:55.343 --> 18:56.970
Uh-This is my house.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.638
Yeah, I'm just visiting.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.849
This isn't your
house, this is my house!

19:00.849 --> 19:04.561
And, and my husband's
gonna be home any second.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.646
This just keeps getting better.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.024
You picked the wrong
house to break in to.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.234
Oh, no, no, no!
You see, we're not bad guys!

19:11.234 --> 19:13.070
HONEY!

19:18.575 --> 19:21.327
At least he's alone.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.878
My.
That was quick.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.089
Uh, we're
we're trapped.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.339
Let's not panic.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.174
ATTENTION, YOU IN THE HOUSE.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.928
COME ON OUT OR WE'RE
GONNA FIRE TEAR GAS.

19:37.928 --> 19:40.597
Okay, let's panic.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.349
Okay-uh...the...There has to
be a wish to get us outta this.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.476
I just uh- I gotta
be smart about it.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.896
Wish us to be a
hundred miles away.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.774
No! You see she could put
us in a burning building,

19:50.774 --> 19:53.192
or the middle of the ocean
or something like that...

19:53.192 --> 19:56.446
It has to be a wish
that's foolproof.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.239
Well don't look at me.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.784
Attention you in the house!
Come out with your hands up...

20:00.784 --> 20:03.202
I got it!
-What?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.413
I wish Sardo had a wish.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.418
What happened?

20:10.418 --> 20:11.962
I gave you a wish!

20:11.962 --> 20:16.091
I mean maybe the evil
wishes only work with me.

20:16.091 --> 20:17.759
Look you can wish us outta this.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.844
You mean, I can wish
for anything I want?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.596
Yes.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.890
You got one minute to come
out with your hands up,

20:23.890 --> 20:25.266
or we'll start shooting.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.102
Think of something, huh? Hurry!

20:27.102 --> 20:29.104
This is the
chance of a lifetime!

20:29.104 --> 20:31.148
If you don't think of
something that lifetime

20:31.148 --> 20:32.482
won't last very long.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.110
They're getting
ready to shoot tear gas.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.360
I could wish for...

20:36.360 --> 20:38.780
for world peace...

20:38.780 --> 20:41.825
or cure every disease...
Wish faster!

20:41.825 --> 20:43.493
Oh, I've got it!

20:43.493 --> 20:44.786
I've got the perfect wish!

20:44.786 --> 20:45.996
Then do it!

20:45.996 --> 20:49.040
I wish I had a
million more wishes!

20:54.045 --> 20:57.256
I'm out.
I'm out for real!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.675
Hahahaha...

20:58.675 --> 21:00.301
Where's Sardo?

21:00.301 --> 21:03.763
He wished a million wishes!

21:03.763 --> 21:06.307
That's what I wished ages
ago and I got stuck

21:06.307 --> 21:08.768
in this dumb box!
Look!

21:08.768 --> 21:11.437
Help!
Please let me out!

21:11.437 --> 21:13.231
I don't wannabe a genie!

21:13.231 --> 21:15.692
Oh, you've got a
million wishes alright,

21:15.692 --> 21:18.528
but you've got to
grant them to others.

21:18.528 --> 21:22.866
Starting with you! (giggle)

21:22.866 --> 21:26.703
Time's up.
We're going to fire!

21:26.703 --> 21:28.163
10... 9... 8...

21:28.163 --> 21:29.998
What do I do?

21:29.998 --> 21:34.878
Don't ask me, I'm not a
genie anymore. (giggle)

21:34.878 --> 21:36.921
Well just don't stand there!

21:36.921 --> 21:39.049
Wish something!!!!

21:39.049 --> 21:42.219
3... 2... one!

21:42.219 --> 21:44.971
I....I wish it was yesterday!

22:10.580 --> 22:12.082
Jason!
Hi!

22:12.082 --> 22:13.958
Oh, oh..
Hey, Andrea.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.460
Hey, what was it you
were gonna ask me before?

22:16.460 --> 22:17.879
Ask?

22:17.879 --> 22:20.298
Oh uh, right.

22:20.298 --> 22:25.011
I was just -uh wondering if
you were doing anything

22:25.011 --> 22:27.055
Friday night cuz, I...

22:27.055 --> 22:33.144
I thought, that maybe you'd like
to-uh go see a movie with me?

22:33.144 --> 22:34.604
I'd love to.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.440
You would?

22:37.440 --> 22:42.112
That's, that's cool!
That's cool.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.654
So huh, where you headed?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.282
I've got a driving lesson.

22:45.282 --> 22:49.535
Really? I-uh.. just
got my license.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.345
The end.

23:07.345 --> 23:08.805
Awesome story.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.807
So he found true love after all.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.809
And Belle's stuck
back in the box.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.059
Cool.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.729
Wanna let her out?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.690
No way.
- No thanks.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.059
Ughhhhh...

23:26.864 --> 23:31.244
I'm dying here.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.454
You finished all the cookies?!?

23:33.454 --> 23:35.081
I... I had to...

23:35.081 --> 23:37.583
they were too good.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.128
I hope they taste as
good on the way up

23:40.128 --> 23:42.922
as they did on the way down.

23:45.091 --> 23:45.931
Ughh...
