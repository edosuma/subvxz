(car horn)

00:38.021 --> 00:40.023
(knock at door)

00:41.149 --> 00:43.777
Gilbert, you'd better get up. They're here.

00:43.861 --> 00:46.321
- I'm up.
- You OK?

00:46.405 --> 00:48.657
- Yeah.
- You sure?

00:48.740 --> 00:51.451
Sure I'm sure.

00:53.161 --> 00:56.874
- You remember the first time you left home?
- Yes.

00:56.957 --> 01:00.002
And I was just as scared as you are.

01:00.085 --> 01:04.423
I'm not scared. I just don't like
the idea of leaving you here all alone.

01:04.506 --> 01:08.343
Oh, I'll be fine. I was fine
when you went away to computer camp.

01:09.011 --> 01:11.805
Mom, that was just for two weeks.

01:11.889 --> 01:16.143
I can take care of myself.
I'm much more worried about you.

01:16.226 --> 01:20.814
I'm gonna be just fine. Anyways,
I'm not gonna be alone. I got Lewis.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.527
Gilbert? Come on, rise and shine.

01:25.611 --> 01:28.405
Dad's waiting outside in the car.
It's all packed.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.991
Hi, Flo. It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

01:31.074 --> 01:35.704
It's gonna be a great year.
Now, I figure with lunch and two ARVs,

01:35.787 --> 01:39.791
we should be on the road approximately
7 hours, 18 minutes and 7 seconds.

01:39.875 --> 01:43.378
- ARVs?
- Average restroom visits.

01:43.462 --> 01:44.963
(laughter)

01:45.047 --> 01:47.382
Oh, I'm so proud of you two boys.

01:47.466 --> 01:50.344
Come on, Gilbert. Let's go to college.

01:50.427 --> 01:52.971
(braying laugh)

02:22.751 --> 02:27.005
Hey, Lewis, what time you got?
I'm tryin' to work out our exact ETA.

02:27.089 --> 02:31.301
I got two thirty-seven.
Dad, how fast are we going?

02:31.385 --> 02:34.721
I've got the old cruise control set at 35.

03:06.879 --> 03:09.631
Adams College, home of the Atoms.

03:10.465 --> 03:12.676
Gilbert, this is gonna be really neat.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.429
I sure hope so. What if it isn't, huh?

03:15.512 --> 03:18.390
Don't be so negative.
We'll have the time of our lives.

03:18.473 --> 03:20.976
I'm not being negative. I'm being nervous.

03:21.059 --> 03:23.729
Don't be, cos everything's gonna be great.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.773
- Just like high school, right?
- This is college.

03:26.857 --> 03:31.445
Remember, there are
6,127 students at Adams.

03:31.528 --> 03:34.156
- 58 per cent of which are girls.
- So?

03:34.239 --> 03:37.576
So that's 7,107.32 boobs.

03:37.659 --> 03:39.953
(braying laughter)

03:40.037 --> 03:45.167
You college guys are all alike.
All you really care about is gettin' laid.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.338
- I wish I was goin' with you.
- (braying laugh)

03:51.298 --> 03:52.883
Dad!

03:58.639 --> 04:01.642
(Lewis) Wow! This campus is awesome.

04:02.726 --> 04:07.940
It's a lot bigger than I expected. Maybe
we should have just gone to City Tech, huh?

04:08.023 --> 04:13.445
Tech's nothin'. You know Adams has got
the best computer department in the country.

04:13.529 --> 04:17.115
Yeah, you're right. Adams is the best.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.225
(Mr Skolnick) Well, boys...
I mean "men"...here we are.

04:49.022 --> 04:53.360
What an opportunity for you guys.
You're both gonna do great.

04:53.443 --> 04:57.948
I'm proud of you. Your father would
have been proud of you, too, Gilbert.

04:58.031 --> 05:03.412
I know, Mr Skolnick. Don't tell my mother
I was nervous. I wouldn't want her to worry.

05:03.495 --> 05:05.956
- Of course not. Don't sweat it.
- Thanks.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.624
(cycle bell rings)

05:07.708 --> 05:10.210
Hey, Lewis, come here. Sit down.

05:13.297 --> 05:15.382
I envy you, Lewis.

05:15.465 --> 05:19.094
This is one of the finest institutions
in the country.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.389
You're gonna do fantastic here.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.852
Try not to break too many hearts.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.146
That hasn't been a real problem yet.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.357
Come on, you're gonna make
some lucky girl very happy.

05:32.441 --> 05:35.485
You're smart, easy-going.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.279
Got your father's good looks.

05:37.362 --> 05:39.907
(braying laughter)

05:39.990 --> 05:44.411
And you got a great sense of humour.
I really believe in you, son.

05:44.494 --> 05:48.040
- Thanks, Dad. I won't let you down.
- I know.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.084
Gilbert, help me with the trunk.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.548
- Uh, Gilbert?
- Yes, sir?

05:58.050 --> 06:00.510
College isn't like high school.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.972
You'll be on your own.
I want you to take care of yourself.

06:04.056 --> 06:07.809
I will. Anyway, I won't be alone. I got Lewis.

06:07.893 --> 06:10.270
Besides, we're college men now, right?

06:10.354 --> 06:12.689
- Right.
- Ow.

06:17.611 --> 06:20.030
It's easier gettin' it down.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.701
Hold it, guys. This is an historic moment.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.871
All right, say "cheese".

06:27.955 --> 06:29.706
(both) Cheese!

06:30.040 --> 06:32.501
Got it.

06:32.584 --> 06:34.836
Bye, Dad.

06:35.879 --> 06:38.298
Bye. Thanks for the ride.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.970
(passers-by laugh)

06:49.226 --> 06:51.103
- You OK?
- Yeah.

06:59.111 --> 07:02.865
- (Gilbert) Bye, Mr Skolnick!
- (Lewis) Drive careful, Dad.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.785
(girl) Watch out!

07:08.996 --> 07:11.081
- Sorry.
- Excuse us.

07:16.378 --> 07:19.214
You know, Gilbert, I feel different already.

07:19.298 --> 07:22.342
Like... more mature.

07:22.426 --> 07:24.761
Looks like we're in for quite a change.

07:24.845 --> 07:30.100
I'll say. Parties, meeting new people.
This is really gonna be great.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.811
- I don't know.
- Just relax. Be yourself.

07:32.895 --> 07:37.065
Like Davy Crockett always said -
be sure you're right, then go ahead.

07:41.403 --> 07:45.157
(all chant) Ogre! Ogre! Ogre! Ogre!

07:45.240 --> 07:48.994
- Anyway, college is a whole new ball game.
- Nerds!

07:49.077 --> 07:52.623
- People judge you different than in school.
- Nerds!

07:53.832 --> 07:55.250
Nerds!

07:57.711 --> 07:59.171
Nerds!

07:59.254 --> 08:02.883
- Where are they?
- I think they're talking about us.

08:02.966 --> 08:05.510
- No way.
- Nerds!

08:06.970 --> 08:09.264
- Nerds! Nerds!
- (all chant) Nerds! Nerds!

08:09.348 --> 08:11.725
Come on, Lewis, let's go.

08:11.808 --> 08:13.977

(man) Ogre!

08:38.460 --> 08:41.046
Fill her up, baby!

08:42.172 --> 08:44.049
All right!

09:01.733 --> 09:06.238
OK, everybody, listen up!
It's time for stair diving!

09:29.094 --> 09:33.724
- Well, Gilbert, here's our new home.
- Can't believe we finally made it.

09:51.867 --> 09:55.287
Lewis, if you don't want
the bed by the window, I'll take it.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.456
- You got it.
- Thanks.

10:04.046 --> 10:08.717
- You know, this is really a great room.
- Yep. Definite possibilities.

10:10.677 --> 10:14.556
Do you think they'd let us put in
a little refrigerator for snacks?

10:14.640 --> 10:19.519
Are you kiddin', Gilbert? We can put
a fridge and a microwave right there.

10:19.603 --> 10:22.689
That'd be a good place
for an entertainment centre, too.

10:22.773 --> 10:25.150
Great.

10:25.234 --> 10:28.862
That's just the beginning.
We'll have the best dorm room on campus.

10:28.946 --> 10:31.990
I don't know about the best.
It'll be the messiest.

10:32.074 --> 10:35.202
Relax, Gilbert. Remember, we got it covered.

10:37.496 --> 10:40.082
This robot will be better than a maid.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.752
It'll help with the women, too.

10:43.835 --> 10:46.255
- Women?
- Yeah.

10:46.338 --> 10:48.590
Let's say one of us is up here with a woman.

10:48.674 --> 10:52.177
This'll be our warning device,
so we don't walk in on each other.

10:52.261 --> 10:56.265
Wait a minute. We're allowed
to have girls in our dorm room?

10:56.348 --> 10:59.685
Not girls, Gil. Women.
We're college men now.

10:59.768 --> 11:03.313
- Isn't college great?
- It's gonna be a great year.

11:06.358 --> 11:09.486

11:11.822 --> 11:14.408
C'mon, Betty. Show me what you got.

11:16.034 --> 11:19.454
Gable, check this out.
Check this out. This is outrageous.

11:19.538 --> 11:22.040
- What is it?
- Just try it.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.918
Oh! You OK?

11:25.002 --> 11:28.297
- Jeez, Burke! What is this?
- 188 proof.

11:28.380 --> 11:33.594
It's called a fireball, man. Watch.
Take that. Flame on, buddy. Flame on!

11:39.016 --> 11:42.269
Yeah! Can you do it again? Do it again.

11:42.352 --> 11:45.981

Fireball. Fireball. Fireball.

12:02.915 --> 12:05.000
(all) Oh, shit!

12:10.714 --> 12:14.134
(all)? Our house, our house is burning down

12:14.218 --> 12:18.347
? Our house, our house,
our house is burning down

12:18.555 --> 12:22.226
? Our house, our house,
our house is burning down

12:22.726 --> 12:27.189
? Our house, our house,
our house is burning down

12:28.774 --> 12:33.111
- It must have been the wiring.
- That isn't what the fire department thinks.

12:33.195 --> 12:36.865
Dean, if my boys say it was the wiring,
you gotta believe them.

12:36.949 --> 12:39.493
Dean, school ought to be more careful.

12:40.035 --> 12:45.749
We got a big game comin' up. I don't want my
boys worried about where they're gonna live.

12:45.832 --> 12:49.545
They should have thought of that
before they burnt their house down.

12:49.628 --> 12:53.048
What's done is done.
Where am I gonna put my athletes?

12:53.131 --> 12:56.593
- The freshman dorm?
- What about the students there now?

12:58.428 --> 13:02.516
All right. Thanks to faulty wiring,
we have no place to live. Right?

13:02.599 --> 13:06.436
- (jocks) Right!
- These freshmen are sittin' pretty in there!

13:06.520 --> 13:09.565
- So as of now, that dorm is ours! Right?
- Yeah!

13:09.648 --> 13:12.317
Any room you want. Ready? Break!

13:22.119 --> 13:24.955
Don't come back!

13:25.038 --> 13:27.457
There's your roommate, pal!

13:30.586 --> 13:33.422
If everyone follows directions,

13:33.505 --> 13:38.093
we can manage this move
with as little inconvenience as possible.

13:38.802 --> 13:43.223
All right, men. I want everybody to listen up.
We're movin' out, and I mean now!

13:43.307 --> 13:47.603
Move it! Move it! Move, move, move!

each and every one of you is taken care of.

14:03.076 --> 14:07.998
You will be provided with the best possible
food, shelter and accommodation.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.499

14:09.583 --> 14:13.420
- We will try to provide you...
- Now let's move it out!

Move it! Move, move, move! Move it!

14:16.798 --> 14:18.884
(jocks jeer)

14:21.762 --> 14:23.722
Move it!

Get outta here!

Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

14:36.109 --> 14:38.195
(chanting continues)

14:45.452 --> 14:48.455
(Dean) I know this move
has been sudden for all of you,

14:48.539 --> 14:53.210
and you're probably all still very disoriented.

14:53.293 --> 14:59.341
I do want to assure you that this move
is in no way permanent. It's only temporary.

14:59.424 --> 15:05.681
As you see, we've provided accommodations
for you that are... quite acceptable.

15:05.764 --> 15:08.559
It'll be a nice place
for you to enjoy your studies.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.769
(boy) I don't even wanna go to college.

15:10.853 --> 15:14.481
You have a special gift.
You need college to develop it.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.608
I wanna be with people my own age.

15:16.692 --> 15:19.778
You will be with people your own age
when you're older.

15:19.862 --> 15:24.867
But you can't drop me off in a gymnasium.
It looks like we're refugees from a war.

15:24.950 --> 15:28.245
We gotta go now, honey.
Your dad has an appointment.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.414
Bye, son.

15:31.540 --> 15:34.668
(Dean) It is really very comfortable here.

15:36.086 --> 15:39.423
Is there anyone here with allergies?

15:40.173 --> 15:43.594
Me too. Uh, for those of you
who do have allergies,

15:43.677 --> 15:46.013
you can request a foam rubber pillow.

15:46.096 --> 15:50.893
Also, there's a television
for your viewing pleasure.

15:50.976 --> 15:53.770
It is a black and white television.

15:53.854 --> 15:58.650
More good news.
Because of the housing situation,

15:58.734 --> 16:02.571
we are allowing the freshman class
to join and live in fraternities.

16:02.654 --> 16:04.698
(all) Yeah!

16:04.781 --> 16:07.701
The fraternities will select
their members tomorrow.

16:07.784 --> 16:09.161
(whistle)

16:09.244 --> 16:12.998
All right! Enough of this
social bullshit. Grab a cot.

16:13.081 --> 16:15.751
Move it or lose it!

16:17.961 --> 16:20.047
(coach) Go, son.

16:20.130 --> 16:21.673
Move!

16:22.216 --> 16:24.301
Move, move, move, move, move!

16:30.807 --> 16:35.687
(Dean on PA) And the Delta Kappa Gamma
fraternity has selected as its new members

16:35.771 --> 16:39.233

16:39.316 --> 16:44.446
(Dean) For those of you
who weren't selected by any fraternities,

16:44.530 --> 16:47.366
you won't be left out in the cold.

16:47.449 --> 16:51.620
You can stay here in the gym
for as long as you like.

but why do they call you "Booger"?

Gilbert, it's probably not over yet.
There's a fraternity for us.

17:53.223 --> 17:55.225
(Dean) Dooley, Edward.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.728
Yozonski, Yosef.

18:02.316 --> 18:06.445
- Wait a second. Are you sure about this?
- Gilbert, yes. Come on.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.913
(Lewis) Hi, girls.

18:15.996 --> 18:18.707
Are you guys looking to join a sorority?

18:18.790 --> 18:20.626
A sorority?

18:20.709 --> 18:23.212
No!

18:23.295 --> 18:29.509
We need some help. We figured pretty girls
like you might be able to suggest a fraternity.

18:29.593 --> 18:35.182
Choosing the right fraternity can be one of
the most important decisions in a man's life.

18:35.265 --> 18:39.102
- For sure.
- Guys like you have to choose very carefully.

18:39.186 --> 18:42.481
- Definitely.
- Tell us what frat do you think is us.

18:42.564 --> 18:46.151
- You guys are Alpha Betas all the way.
- Totally. For sure.

18:46.235 --> 18:50.572
What? Wait. Aren't Alpha Betas,
like, all jocks and face men?

18:50.656 --> 18:55.869
Yes. But you guys have got that certain
something I know they'd be interested in.

18:55.953 --> 19:00.165
- I'll tell 'em you're coming.
- Should we ask for a particular Alpha Beta?

19:00.249 --> 19:02.918
- Stan Gable.
- And you're?

19:03.585 --> 19:05.504
Betty Childs.

19:06.296 --> 19:08.340
Thank you, Betty. Ms Childs.

19:08.423 --> 19:13.095
Maybe if you're not busy sometime
we could have a cup of coffee or somethin'.

19:13.178 --> 19:15.389
Come on, pal.

19:15.472 --> 19:18.475
(Gilbert) I can't believe you asked her out.

19:18.892 --> 19:23.230
(Lewis) You know, Gilbert, if we get in,
maybe we can have our old room back.

19:23.313 --> 19:26.817
- (Gilbert) These guys will never accept us.
- Why wouldn't they?

19:26.900 --> 19:31.071
These are the Alpha Betas.
They're the football players.

19:31.780 --> 19:34.825
I don't think Ms Childs
would have sent us over here

19:34.908 --> 19:38.161
if she didn't think we had
a decent chance of getting in.

19:39.329 --> 19:41.206
(door creaks)

19:41.290 --> 19:43.292
- (eerily) Yes?
- Hi.

19:43.375 --> 19:47.838
Tell Stan Gable that we're the guys
that Betty Childs sent over.

19:47.921 --> 19:50.465
Follow me, boys.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.634
(door creaks)

19:53.677 --> 19:55.554
Gilbert!

20:23.373 --> 20:25.751
(solemnly) Welcome.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.920
(both) Hi.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.840
(Stan) Hey!

20:33.217 --> 20:36.845
You guys seem pretty cool.
Take these for later.

20:39.431 --> 20:42.267
Rubbers? What do we need rubbers for?

20:42.351 --> 20:44.520
(sheep bleats)

20:47.606 --> 20:49.942
(Stan) Let the initiation begin.

20:50.567 --> 20:53.487
(jock) Have you ever made love to a woman?

20:53.570 --> 20:54.530
- Yes.
- No.

20:54.613 --> 20:56.448
- No.
- Yes.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.451
(jocks) Liars!

21:00.035 --> 21:02.371
(TV) All right, let's go for the burn.

21:02.454 --> 21:05.040
(horrible tuneless scraping)

21:09.962 --> 21:13.215
- OK, Takashi, whaddaya got?
- Oh, I think I have a frush.

21:13.298 --> 21:16.176
- What the fuck is a "frush"?
- A frush.

21:16.260 --> 21:19.221
I got two sevens,
and two sevens beats a frush.

21:19.304 --> 21:20.681
Oh, thank you.

21:20.764 --> 21:23.684
(tuneless violin playing continues)

21:34.069 --> 21:36.822
- Oh!
- Jesus.

21:40.492 --> 21:42.578
(violin stops)

21:47.249 --> 21:52.504
So, getting into a fraternity can be the most
important thing in a man's life, huh?

21:52.588 --> 21:56.049
You know, that cheerleader set us up, Lewis.

21:56.133 --> 22:00.304
I really don't think Betty Childs
is that kind of person, Gilbert.

22:02.723 --> 22:04.850
Hey, Lewis?

22:04.933 --> 22:07.019
What is it, Gilbert?

22:07.978 --> 22:12.316
I'm really sorry that I snapped at you.
This gym's really gettin' to me.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.610
It's OK. I understand.

22:14.693 --> 22:18.906
Tomorrow morning we'll find
a better place to live, OK?

22:18.989 --> 22:21.909
- Good night, Gilbert.
- Good night, Lewis.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.746
- Good night, Lamar.
- Good night, Wormser.

22:25.829 --> 22:29.625
- Good night, Takashi.
- Good night, Poindexter.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.794
- Good night, Booger.
- (loud belch)

22:32.878 --> 22:35.214
(all laugh)

22:39.301 --> 22:40.344
(thud)

22:47.100 --> 22:51.146
Hey, take it easy. The computer's your friend.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.607
I wasn't meant to interface with a machine.

22:53.690 --> 22:56.443
Well, you're just beginning. Relax.

22:57.361 --> 22:59.988
It's no use. It's inhuman.

23:00.072 --> 23:03.450
It's not inhuman.
Only humans can be inhuman.

23:04.284 --> 23:06.203
Here, let me show you.

23:10.958 --> 23:13.293
Working with a computer's great.

23:13.377 --> 23:16.755
I mean, it's godlike, in a way,

23:16.838 --> 23:19.675
cos you can have complete control.

23:22.302 --> 23:24.388
- That's good.
- Thanks.

23:26.473 --> 23:30.727
You know, some people,
they can create with their hands.

23:30.811 --> 23:36.024
But when you're working with a computer,
you gotta build something with your mind.

23:37.192 --> 23:41.154
If you're good, you can do somethin'
no one's ever seen before.

23:42.114 --> 23:44.199
It's a definite high.

23:51.415 --> 23:54.251
Uh... what's your name?

23:54.334 --> 23:56.879
- Judy.
- Hi, Judy. Gilbert.

23:57.254 --> 24:00.883
- (Judy) Very nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.600
- Hello, Lewis.
- Hi, Gilbert.

24:10.684 --> 24:13.562
- Did you find a house?
- No.

24:13.645 --> 24:15.772
I met a girl.

24:15.856 --> 24:18.066
Gilbert!

24:18.150 --> 24:21.612
- Her name's Judy.
- Judy's a nice name, Gilbert.

24:21.695 --> 24:25.616
- Yeah. She's a nice girl.
- Big deal. Did you get in her pants?

24:25.699 --> 24:29.369
- She's not that kind of a girl.
- Why? Does she have a penis?

24:34.208 --> 24:36.293
You gonna eat this?

24:41.298 --> 24:44.718
- Smell this one, nerd.
- Oh, Coach, Coach.

24:44.801 --> 24:48.180
I got to find a place to live.
Is OK I leave early?

24:48.931 --> 24:50.682
No.

24:50.766 --> 24:53.101
Oh, OK.

24:53.185 --> 24:54.645
- You know karate?
- No.

24:54.728 --> 24:56.605
Good.

24:59.858 --> 25:03.111
I've programmed him with
all the rental units in the area.

25:03.195 --> 25:07.157
For optimum efficiency,
I've assigned each of you a part of the list.

25:07.241 --> 25:11.787
This'll prevent doubling up.
We'll be able to blanket the area in no time.

25:11.870 --> 25:13.997
Booger.

25:14.706 --> 25:16.583
Wormser.

25:17.793 --> 25:19.294
Toshiro.

25:25.801 --> 25:27.886
(speaks Japanese)

25:29.805 --> 25:31.890
(replies in Japanese)

25:32.850 --> 25:34.393
Nerd!

25:45.612 --> 25:48.031
- Hi.
- All right?

25:48.115 --> 25:51.034
- Mr Wilson?
- Yeah.

25:53.161 --> 25:55.080
Just checking.

25:55.873 --> 25:58.166
(woman) Hi there, big boy.

25:58.250 --> 26:01.962
Hi. I came about the room for rent.

26:02.045 --> 26:06.216
It's right next to mine.
It'll be perfect for us.

26:09.303 --> 26:11.513
(buzzer)

26:13.682 --> 26:16.852
(man) Who's there? What do you want?

26:16.935 --> 26:20.564
- Is this the Stewart residence?
- Why are you here? What do you want?

26:20.647 --> 26:23.567
- I've come about the room.
- Go away.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.861
- Do you have a room to rent?
- Not for rent.

26:25.944 --> 26:28.405
- I thought it was for rent.
- Fuck off.

26:36.330 --> 26:38.457
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Gilbert.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.876
- How are you?
- Fine. Where are you going?

26:40.959 --> 26:43.712
I gotta go find a place to live.

26:43.795 --> 26:48.217
- It's horrible you having to live in the gym.
- Oh, yeah, well...

26:48.634 --> 26:51.720
- What is that? Is that yours?
- It's my accordion.

26:51.803 --> 26:53.931
- You play the accordion?
- Yeah.

26:54.014 --> 26:56.183
- I love the accordion.
- Really?

26:56.266 --> 26:59.811
- Are you very good, or?
- No, not really.

26:59.895 --> 27:02.481
I'm on my way to class.
Do you wanna walk with me?

27:02.564 --> 27:05.150
Yeah, sure. Oh, no. Here, let me get it.

27:13.242 --> 27:15.953
- I think I found a house.
- (nerds cheer)

27:16.036 --> 27:18.455
(Booger) About fuckin' time!

27:23.794 --> 27:26.296
Isn't it fantastic?

27:26.380 --> 27:29.591
(? "One Foot In Front Of The Other"
by Bone Symphony)

27:51.530 --> 27:53.615
(imitates Dracula) Welcome.

28:11.884 --> 28:16.096
- Are you feeling anything yet, Takashi?
- Oh, Booger, I feel nothing.

28:16.179 --> 28:18.682
You better have another hit.

28:28.734 --> 28:31.570
Oh, this counter. Could be good.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.457
Agh!

28:47.419 --> 28:50.005
- Feeling anything now?
- Oh, no.

28:50.088 --> 28:54.509
I feeling... nothing... at all.

28:56.637 --> 28:58.472
How about now?

29:25.916 --> 29:28.669
I can't believe what
they've done to that house.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.588
That's amazing.

29:31.672 --> 29:36.301
- Looks terrific, doesn't it, Stan?
- Yeah, well, it won't look terrific for long.

29:37.594 --> 29:40.264
What are you lookin' at, nerd? Huh?

29:42.683 --> 29:47.771
I thought I was looking at my mother's
old douche bag, but that's in Ohio.

29:48.105 --> 29:51.066
Seven and eight. And stretch those arms.

29:51.149 --> 29:54.653
Come on. Looks great. Come on, Wormser.

30:00.659 --> 30:02.744
- Morning, Poindexter.
- Uh.

30:05.163 --> 30:07.249
Agh! Excuse me.

30:11.587 --> 30:14.006
Ah, thank you very much.

30:16.717 --> 30:18.760
OK, Takashi, show me your cards.

30:18.844 --> 30:21.471
OK. Two and four kings. That's good, yes?

30:21.555 --> 30:25.017
No, you got too many kings.
So you gotta get rid of these here.

30:25.100 --> 30:30.355
Take three of these kings out,
and replace them with... three fresh cards.

30:30.439 --> 30:33.192
Oh, OK. Thank you.

30:33.275 --> 30:37.070
- (Toshiro) When do I deal?
- (Booger) You gotta win a hand first.

30:37.154 --> 30:40.157
I told you we'd find a better place.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.452
Yeah. This is way better than the dorm.

30:45.621 --> 30:47.748
(motorcycle drives away)

30:53.587 --> 30:56.089
It says "Nerds get out."

30:56.173 --> 30:58.217
What is a nerd?

30:58.300 --> 31:00.385
We are.

31:01.553 --> 31:05.933
I don't know what this world is comin' to.
You see that man over there?

31:06.016 --> 31:08.810
We arrested him for mopery.

31:08.894 --> 31:13.857
- What's mopery?
- Exposing yourself to a blind person.

31:15.901 --> 31:19.613
I'm sorry about your windows, fellas.
It's out of my jurisdiction.

31:19.696 --> 31:24.368
Sounds like a fraternity prank. There's only
one organisation that can handle this.

31:24.451 --> 31:26.954
What organisation is that?

31:28.205 --> 31:30.082
The Greek Council.

31:30.165 --> 31:34.336
(Dean) Our next order of business:
New membership.

31:34.419 --> 31:37.130
Earl, show the petitioners in, please.

31:46.223 --> 31:48.308
(sniggering)

31:50.435 --> 31:51.937
Shh!

31:54.898 --> 31:57.067
Kneel, gentlemen.

32:03.866 --> 32:06.869
You are the gentlemen
who wish to form a fraternity?

32:06.952 --> 32:09.037
(nerds) Yes, sir.

32:14.543 --> 32:17.045
Gentlemen,
as president of the Greek Council,

32:17.129 --> 32:20.674
I'm sorry to inform you
that your membership has been denied.

32:21.091 --> 32:23.051
Excuse me, but... why?

32:23.135 --> 32:27.681
According to our charter, you must
have a national fraternity as your sponsor.

32:27.764 --> 32:29.892
Do you have one?

32:29.975 --> 32:31.602
(all) No.

32:32.644 --> 32:37.024
- I'm afraid he's right.
- But with a national sponsor, we're in, right?

32:37.107 --> 32:41.778
Right, right. So I guess
we'll see you in about, say... 20 years.

32:41.862 --> 32:44.198
(laughter)

32:45.782 --> 32:47.868
(tuneless scraping)

32:51.246 --> 32:55.250
"Dear sirs, thank you for applying
to Delta Kappa Gamma."

32:55.334 --> 32:59.504
"We have gone over your application,
and it wasn't even close."

33:00.339 --> 33:04.134
"In the future, we recommend
that you not include a group photo."

33:04.218 --> 33:08.555
That's 29 rejections so far.
Did we send pictures to everybody?

33:09.932 --> 33:13.894
Yeah. Everybody except for...
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

33:14.770 --> 33:17.147
Here's one that will see us.

33:17.231 --> 33:19.066
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda?

33:19.149 --> 33:22.402
Yeah. They're gonna love us.

33:27.157 --> 33:30.035
As you know, we have
no chapter at Adams College,

33:30.118 --> 33:32.663
which is why we agreed to see you.

33:32.746 --> 33:38.585
But I must tell you, gentlemen, you have
very little chance of becoming Tri-Lambdas.

33:39.378 --> 33:41.922
I'm in a difficult situation here.

33:42.548 --> 33:44.633
I mean, after all...

33:45.676 --> 33:47.177
you're nerds.

33:49.137 --> 33:54.434
According to your bylaws,
you have to take us on a 60-day trial basis.

33:54.935 --> 33:57.563
- I beg your pardon?
- According to your bylaws...

33:57.646 --> 34:03.902
He's right, UN. Any group that petitions
can become a probationary Tri-Lamb chapter.

34:03.986 --> 34:06.071
May I see that, please?

34:08.197 --> 34:10.074
Thank you.

34:16.456 --> 34:20.502
Well, gentlemen...
you are now probationary Tri-Lambs.

34:21.043 --> 34:24.005
- Hey.
- Great, UN. Why don't we have a party?

34:24.089 --> 34:29.511
You can celebrate with us and observe us
to make sure we're Tri-Lamb material, OK?

34:29.594 --> 34:31.554
- Great.
- We won't let you down.

34:31.638 --> 34:35.434
We'll have the highest grade-point
average of any chapter you've got.

34:35.516 --> 34:41.356
We certainly won't discriminate. Our chapter
will be open to people of all races and creeds.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.775
And sexual orientation.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.112
Wonderful.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.157
(door bell)

34:54.995 --> 34:57.247
Hi. Remember me?

34:57.331 --> 35:00.375
- No.
- Well, we're having a party Saturday night.

35:00.459 --> 35:02.628
Would you like to come?

35:02.711 --> 35:05.214
- No.
- Oh, well...

35:05.964 --> 35:07.883
(girls'laughter)

35:07.966 --> 35:10.135
Come on, get it up! Get it up! C'mon!

35:10.219 --> 35:13.472

- What's up, Betty? Is somethin' wrong?
- Yeah.

35:21.647 --> 35:24.942
- What?
- One of those nerds just asked me out.

35:25.025 --> 35:28.362
- Which one?
- I don't know. They all look alike to me.

35:28.445 --> 35:31.657
- Yeah.
- They can't get any dates for their party.

35:31.740 --> 35:35.869
- Oh, yeah?
- I'll eat their ancestors. I'll kill their parents!

35:35.953 --> 35:40.624
No, Ogre. Ogre! Don't worry about it.
Wait a second. Just wait a second.

35:43.293 --> 35:45.379
Maybe we could help 'em out.

35:45.462 --> 35:47.297
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:47.381 --> 35:50.759
And I know just what to do.

35:50.842 --> 35:52.386
Come here.

35:56.557 --> 36:02.563
We'll put the bar here, the hors d'oeuvres
over there, and we'll pass the cheese puffs.

36:02.646 --> 36:04.648
- Oh, good.
- That sounds expensive.

36:04.731 --> 36:09.319
This party's important. If we don't impress
the Tri-Lambs, we'll never get in.

36:09.403 --> 36:13.740
- Maybe we can have robster craws.
- What the fuck are "robster craws"?

36:13.824 --> 36:17.369
- Have any of you got dates, besides Gilbert?
- I do.

36:17.452 --> 36:20.706
- Yeah, but that's with a guy.
- What about you, Booger?

36:20.789 --> 36:24.084
I've been out combing
the high schools all day.

36:24.167 --> 36:28.130
- Maybe we should cancel the party.
- No, we can't cancel the party.

UN Jefferson's coming.
We gotta impress him.

It must be the music.
I'll put on something he'll like better.

38:14.027 --> 38:15.445
- Lewis?
- UN?

38:15.529 --> 38:18.448
- Great party.
- Thanks.

you have dates with?

- Yeah.
- I could call my sorority sisters.

38:43.849 --> 38:46.059
- You could?
- You think they'll come?

38:46.143 --> 38:49.897
They're really spontaneous people.
I'll call 'em.

- Who?

This party isn't going very well, is it?
I don't know why everybody's so uptight.

41:03.363 --> 41:06.825
I don't know either. Maybe we should eat.

I was thinking mostly of the aerospace field.

I wanted something more challenging.

you get that jock dorm,

54:51.149 --> 54:54.278
you get the laundry money,
you get the new cars.

54:55.028 --> 55:00.158
Now, this season started out fine -
we won some big ball games.

55:00.242 --> 55:02.578
But we were lucky.

55:02.661 --> 55:06.456
We can't get soft.
We can't sit back on our laurels.

55:06.540 --> 55:09.793
We win homecoming, we take league.

55:09.877 --> 55:12.921
We take league, we get a bowl bid.

55:13.005 --> 55:15.465
It's as simple as that.

55:15.549 --> 55:18.927
But, gentlemen, you have got to want it.

55:19.636 --> 55:22.097
- Do you want it?
- (jocks yell) Yeah!

55:22.181 --> 55:24.433
- I can't hear you.
- Yeah!

55:24.516 --> 55:27.644
We can't let up. We gotta stay tough.

55:28.437 --> 55:30.439
You can do it. You can do it.

55:30.606 --> 55:33.275
You can do it. You can do it.

55:33.358 --> 55:36.320
You gotta believe that you can do it!

55:37.779 --> 55:40.991
- You gotta let them know that you want it!
- I want it!

55:41.074 --> 55:42.951
- Good.
- (groans)

55:43.035 --> 55:45.120
Shower up!

55:45.204 --> 55:47.789
(jocks groan in pain)

55:48.832 --> 55:51.335
Shit. We forgot to practise.

55:52.920 --> 55:56.131
- You put what?
- (Gilbert) Liquid Heat.

55:56.215 --> 55:59.343
- On their what?
- In their jocks.

55:59.426 --> 56:02.095
- That's outrageous.
- Are you angry, UN?

56:03.514 --> 56:07.017
No. I'm not angry.

56:07.100 --> 56:10.896
I'm glad to see you nerds...
you guys finally fought back.

56:10.979 --> 56:14.816
You'd make a fine addition to Tri-Lambda.
I want to welcome you aboard.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.361
- Congratulations.
- All right!

56:17.444 --> 56:21.615
- You'll tell the guys?
- Oh, I will. (braying laugh)

56:22.741 --> 56:24.701
OK, everybody ready?

56:25.285 --> 56:27.246
OK, I focus now.

56:27.329 --> 56:29.873
I set timer.

56:29.957 --> 56:33.293
- Now say "Hi, UN."
- (all) Hi, UN.

56:37.714 --> 56:41.593
(Lewis) Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to UN Jefferson,

56:42.177 --> 56:46.723
who, in his ultimate wisdom,
chose to accept us

56:46.807 --> 56:50.060
into our new fraternity,
Lambda Lambda Lambda.

56:50.143 --> 56:52.646
(all) Lambda Lambda Lambda.

57:02.114 --> 57:06.827
Before we take this matter to a vote,
I would like it clearly stated in the record...

57:06.910 --> 57:08.787
Miss Childs...

57:08.871 --> 57:13.709
that the evidence is
overwhelmingly against the Alpha Betas,

57:13.792 --> 57:16.753
and I urge that they be found guilty.

57:16.837 --> 57:18.922
Point of order.

57:20.007 --> 57:23.927
Dean Ulich, I am an Alpha Beta,

57:24.011 --> 57:26.680
and I know that no member of my fraternity

57:26.763 --> 57:31.393
could have perpetrated such
a callous, heinous act against the nerds...

57:31.476 --> 57:33.687
or the Tri-Lambs.

57:33.770 --> 57:38.525
Therefore, I feel a vote at this time
would be, shall we say, premature.

57:38.609 --> 57:40.861
- Premature?
- Yes.

57:40.944 --> 57:43.113
You see, instead,

57:43.197 --> 57:47.910
I am going to organise a special,
blue-ribbon, fact-finding commission,

57:47.993 --> 57:52.164
made up of myself and... Miss Betty Childs.

57:52.956 --> 57:55.542
We will get to the bottom
of this dastardly deed.

57:55.626 --> 57:59.838
- Wait a minute, you can't get away with this.
- Oh, no, I'm afraid I can.

57:59.922 --> 58:05.010
You see, only the president
of the Greek Council can call a vote.

58:05.093 --> 58:08.055
- That's completely unfair.
- This is bullshit!

58:08.138 --> 58:09.932
Meeting adjourned.

58:16.688 --> 58:20.817
Guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake
as long as Stan Gable is president.

58:20.901 --> 58:24.571
The only way to become president
is to win the homecoming carnival.

58:24.655 --> 58:28.700
That's right, Arnold. And that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

58:29.034 --> 58:30.911
(fanfare)

58:32.788 --> 58:39.503
I take great pleasure in officially opening
this year's homecoming carnival.

58:39.586 --> 58:41.964
(cheering)

58:47.803 --> 58:53.267
(Dean) The overall winner
will be determined by total points from:

58:53.350 --> 58:56.103
Number one - field events,

58:56.186 --> 58:59.690
number two - the charity fund-raising booth,

58:59.773 --> 59:04.570
and number three -
the musical show and skit competition.

59:04.653 --> 59:08.282
And now, let the games begin!

59:08.365 --> 59:11.702
(cheering and fanfare)

59:17.916 --> 59:22.671
OK. The object of the race
is to complete 20 laps around the track,

59:22.754 --> 59:25.924
while stopping every lap
for a mandatory pit stop,

59:26.008 --> 59:28.886
at which time the driver will chug a beer.

59:29.928 --> 59:32.222
You don't have a fucking chance, nerd.

59:32.306 --> 59:35.934
- Oh, thank you. Good luck to you, too, Burke.
- Fuck off.

59:36.351 --> 59:39.146
Gentlemen, start your engines.

59:39.229 --> 59:40.772
(pistol shot)

59:40.856 --> 59:42.858
(? "Daisy, Daisy")

59:59.458 --> 01:00:04.463
This is trichloromethalene. It counters
all effects of alcohol in your system.

01:00:05.214 --> 01:00:08.425
- Drink the whole beer.
- (Stan) Go! Go! C'mon, Danny!

01:00:08.509 --> 01:00:10.761
You got 'em! Kick his ass!

01:00:10.844 --> 01:00:13.597
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:26.235
- OK, OK. C'mon.
- Are you feelin' OK?

01:00:26.318 --> 01:00:29.029
- Oh, fucking great!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:36.286
Come on, baby! Yeah!

01:00:40.874 --> 01:00:42.125
Come on!

01:00:42.209 --> 01:00:45.003
- One more lap.
- It's just you and the Alpha Betas.

01:00:45.087 --> 01:00:48.966
- Danny, let that nerd beat you, you're nothin'!
- No sweat.

01:00:49.049 --> 01:00:52.302
- He no stand no chance now.
- Go, Takashi!

01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:54.763
Go on! Let's go, Burke!

01:00:54.847 --> 01:00:56.640
Oh, no!

01:00:57.391 --> 01:00:59.685
All right! Come on! Go!

01:01:00.143 --> 01:01:02.187
(Ogre) Ah, man, he's wasted!

01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:05.482
(? "Daisy, Daisy" sung in Japanese)

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:11.989
(Stan) Come on, Burke! You're an Alpha Beta!

01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:20.914
Oh, I won!

01:01:27.546 --> 01:01:31.508
Times are changin', Betty.
These nerds are a threat to our way of life.

01:01:31.592 --> 01:01:35.095
If they win homecoming,
they'll take over the Greek Council.

01:01:35.179 --> 01:01:37.848
And we'll be up to our necks in nerd shit!

01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:45.439
(Dean on PA) Our next competition
will be the Trojan Horse.

01:01:45.522 --> 01:01:47.941
(? Overture from "William Tell"
by Rossini)

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.072
C'mon! Get off! Get off!

01:01:55.657 --> 01:01:57.576
- Ow!
- Yeah!

01:01:57.659 --> 01:02:00.537
What are those Alpha Betas doing?

01:02:46.959 --> 01:02:49.878
(booing and jeering)

01:02:55.092 --> 01:02:57.177
(cheering)

01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:05.602
(crowd chant) Ogre! Ogre! Ogre!

01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:30.752
(weeps)

01:03:31.295 --> 01:03:33.714
(Coach) On your mark. Set.

01:03:34.673 --> 01:03:36.758
(whistle)

01:03:44.516 --> 01:03:46.560
(Coach chuckles)

01:03:46.643 --> 01:03:49.688
(cheerleaders chant) Ooh, ah, Alpha Beta!

01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:50.939
Ooh, ah...

01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:53.609
(Coach) On your mark. Set.

01:03:54.318 --> 01:03:56.278
(whistle)

01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:01.867
You win.

01:04:07.164 --> 01:04:09.666
(Dean chuckles)

01:04:15.964 --> 01:04:21.595
I'm not too wild about this next event,
but it has become a tradition here at Adams.

01:04:21.678 --> 01:04:23.305
The belching contest.

01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:29.019
Our first of two finalists,
Frederick W Polowoski.

01:04:31.313 --> 01:04:33.398
Ogre You Asshole.

01:04:34.191 --> 01:04:36.068
Ogre.

01:04:40.864 --> 01:04:43.492
(belches loudly and long)

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:46.245
(cheering and applause)

01:04:57.339 --> 01:05:01.885
And, from the Lambda-Mu team,
Dudley Dawson.

01:05:01.969 --> 01:05:04.054
- Booger.
- Booger.

01:05:11.311 --> 01:05:14.231
(belches louder and longer)

01:05:29.162 --> 01:05:34.877
Our next event goes all the way back to
the Peloponnesian War - the javelin throw.

01:06:12.206 --> 01:06:14.917
- All right, baby!
- What did you expect?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.544
You won it.

01:06:17.628 --> 01:06:19.713
(laughter)

01:06:23.133 --> 01:06:25.969
- (Gilbert) Wait for Lamar's throw.
- (Judy) How come?

01:06:26.053 --> 01:06:29.765
Wormser's a master at aerodynamics.
He designed the javelin to fit

01:06:29.848 --> 01:06:32.434
with Lamar's limp-wristed throwing style.

01:06:34.645 --> 01:06:37.773
(? Parody of music from "Chariots of Fire")

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.882
Wormser, it worked!

01:07:03.966 --> 01:07:06.260
I can't believe it. Did you see that?

01:07:13.475 --> 01:07:15.561
I love you all. I love you all.

01:07:15.644 --> 01:07:17.729
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:22.501 --> 01:07:27.673
(Dean on PA) The Alpha Beta-Pi team leads.
The Lambda-Mus are a surprising second.

01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:31.385
Now let's see what happens
at the charity fund-raising booths.

01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:34.221
Eat a Pi for charity. C'mon, let's go!

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:43.689
Take a break, Chip.

01:07:46.859 --> 01:07:48.527
Hi.

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:53.073
- Hi, Betty.
- A nerd.

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:59.580
- I'm not kissing a nerd.
- You have to. I've paid my money.

01:08:01.165 --> 01:08:03.584
It's time for my break.

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:06.587
Kiss this, nerd.

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:09.840
- (Betty) Stan?
- Yeah?

01:08:12.051 --> 01:08:15.262
I wanna do it.
All this kissing's made me horny.

01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:17.930
God, Betty. You're like a goat.

01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:24.520
Next.

01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:55.135
Stan!

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:00.599
Changed your mind.

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:05.729
I'm glad. Come on.

01:09:12.027 --> 01:09:15.154
(Lewis mimics Darth Vader's breathing)

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:29.377
D'you wanna do it on the moon?

01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:51.191
Take off your mask.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.359
Oh, Stan.

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:55.738
You're so kinky.

01:10:00.617 --> 01:10:04.872
(Booger) Eat a Pi for charity.
C'mon, step right up. C'mon, step up.

01:10:04.955 --> 01:10:08.667
Eat Pi for charity. Thank you very much.

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.419
Eat a Pi for charity.

01:10:10.836 --> 01:10:15.799
- Gable, how we doing?
- Great. 1258 bucks. Better than last year.

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:19.595
- The nerds are over 2,000.
- For selling pies?

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:23.599
They got a line around the corner.
Guys are buying two, three pies apiece.

01:10:23.682 --> 01:10:27.936
There's something fishy about these pies.
C'mon, let's go check it out.

01:10:35.277 --> 01:10:40.032
This can't be. Ogre, go get a pie.
Find out what the hell's goin' on here.

01:10:43.577 --> 01:10:46.080
Thanks, wimp. Get yourself one.

01:10:49.166 --> 01:10:50.834
- Well? How is it?
- Good.

01:10:50.918 --> 01:10:53.629
- Is it good or is it great?
- It's good.

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:56.298
Just good?
Then what they sellin' so many for?

01:10:56.382 --> 01:10:59.385
This why. Uh-oh.

01:11:05.057 --> 01:11:06.725
That's my Pi.

01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:17.736
Oh, Stan!

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.239
That was wonderful.

01:11:20.322 --> 01:11:23.492
You did things to me
you've never done before.

01:11:23.575 --> 01:11:25.160
(gasps)

01:11:25.244 --> 01:11:27.830
- You're that nerd!
- Yeah.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.875
God, you were wonderful.

01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:33.836
Thanks.

01:11:35.337 --> 01:11:39.133
- Are all nerds as good as you?
- Yes.

01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:40.968
How come?

01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.637
Cos all jocks think about is sports.

01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:47.099
All we ever think about is sex.

01:11:48.892 --> 01:11:51.812
- What's your name?
- Lewis.

01:11:51.895 --> 01:11:58.027
Lewis... would you meet me
after the pep rally tonight?

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.987
Sure.

01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:09.955
(Dean on PA) It's all tied up. The musical
and skit competition will decide the winner.

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:12.833
So, let the music begin!

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:17.254
? Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:19.548
? Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:23.218
? Life is but a dream

01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:26.138
(cheering and applause)

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:31.685
What did the Pink Panther say
when he stepped on an ant?

01:12:31.769 --> 01:12:35.397
(? "Pink Panther" tune) Dead ant. Dead ant.
Dead ant, dead ant, dead ant.

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:38.776
What is the dirtiest thing
ever said on television?

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:39.860
Tell me.

01:12:39.943 --> 01:12:43.697
"Ward, I think you were
a little hard on the Beaver last night."

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:50.287
(all chant) Gable, Gable, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Burke can.

01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:53.791
Burke, Burke, he's our man.
If he can't do it, Ogre can.

01:12:53.874 --> 01:12:55.334
- Gimme an A!
- A!

01:12:55.417 --> 01:12:57.086
- Gimme a D!
- D!

01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:58.962
- Gimme an A!
- A!

- What's that spell?
- Adams!

01:13:07.721 --> 01:13:10.974
? They always call him Mr Touchdown

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:14.561
? They always call him Mr T

01:13:14.645 --> 01:13:17.981
? He can run and kick and throw

01:13:18.065 --> 01:13:20.693
? Give him the ball and just look at him go

01:13:20.776 --> 01:13:24.446
? Hip, hip, hooray for Mr Touchdown

01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:27.157
? He's gonna beat 'em today

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:30.661
? So give a great big cheer
for the hero of the year

01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:33.789
? Mr Touchdown USA

01:13:33.872 --> 01:13:35.165
Hurrah!

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:38.377
(loud cheering and applause)

01:13:54.018 --> 01:13:56.687
(? Electronic dance music)

01:14:03.444 --> 01:14:05.529
(well-played violin riff)

01:14:53.827 --> 01:14:58.082
? Clap your hands, everybody
And everybody clap your hands

01:14:58.165 --> 01:15:02.544
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:07.132
? We come here on stage tonight
to do our show for you

01:15:07.216 --> 01:15:09.426
? We got a rockin' rhythm and a hi-tech sound

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:11.679
? That'll make you move
your body down to the ground

01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:16.266
? We got Poindexter on the violin
And Lewis and Gilbert will be joinin' in

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:20.854
? We got Booger Presley on a mean guitar
And a rap by little old me, Lamar

01:15:20.938 --> 01:15:23.482
? We got Takashi beating on his gong

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:25.693
? The boys and the Mus are clappin' along

01:15:25.776 --> 01:15:28.028
? And just when you thought you'd seen it all

01:15:28.112 --> 01:15:30.322
? Along comes a Lambda four foot tall

01:15:30.406 --> 01:15:32.533
? So, Wormser, come on out here on the floor

01:15:32.616 --> 01:15:34.952
? So we can work our bodies
like never before

01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:37.871
? Break

01:16:08.152 --> 01:16:10.738
(wild cheering and applause)

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:34.511
I'd like to present the trophy
to this year's champions,

01:16:34.595 --> 01:16:37.514
Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu.

01:16:43.187 --> 01:16:48.942
They will be able to select the president
of next year's Greek Council.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:57.493
I'd like to announce we've made
our selection already. It's Gilbert Lowe!

01:17:01.413 --> 01:17:05.250
This sucks! I gotta get rid of this anger.
C'mon, Betty, let's pump iron.

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:07.878
No, Stan. I don't think so.

01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:11.673
What d'you mean, you don't think so?
C'mon, let's go. Why not?

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:14.927
I've got a date with a Tri-Lamb.

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.596
- A Tri-Lamb!
- Here's your pin.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.642
Take it.

01:17:21.725 --> 01:17:23.936
Wait. Betty...

01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:25.646
C'mon.

01:17:26.563 --> 01:17:29.191
God! I'm in love with a nerd!

01:17:30.901 --> 01:17:33.821
- Gable.
- Yeah, Coach.

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:39.493
I wanna see you and the other girls
in the locker room now!

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:41.787
Yes, sir.

01:17:48.961 --> 01:17:52.506
You know, when you were
a baby in your crib,

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:56.802
your father looked down at you,
he had but one hope -

01:17:57.428 --> 01:18:00.180
"Someday my son will grow to be a man."

01:18:02.057 --> 01:18:04.601
Well, look at you now.

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:12.735
You just got your asses whipped
by a bunch of goddamn nerds.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.239
Nerds!

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:22.494
Well, if I was you, I'd do something about it.

01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:27.374
I would get up and redeem myself

01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:32.671
in the eyes of my father,
my Maker and my coach!

01:18:32.755 --> 01:18:35.507
- Let's get those nerds!
- Nerds!

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:37.092
Nerds!

01:18:37.176 --> 01:18:39.595
What are we waitin' for?!

01:18:47.394 --> 01:18:52.191
? We're Lambda Lambda Lambda
and Omega Mu

01:18:52.274 --> 01:18:55.402
(chanting) Nerds! Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:04.995
(Stan) Come on!

01:19:05.079 --> 01:19:07.748
Come on!

01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.569
I'm a nerd.

01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:41.615
Welcome to the real world.

01:19:41.699 --> 01:19:44.535
I never really wanted to believe that.

01:19:44.618 --> 01:19:47.329
- It's OK.
- It's not OK.

01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:49.998
We're nothing.

01:19:50.082 --> 01:19:52.459
We let them destroy our house.

01:19:52.543 --> 01:19:56.213
- We'll control the Greek Council next year.
- Big deal!

01:19:57.756 --> 01:20:00.926
You'll be dead by then, Gilbert.

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:05.305
Nobody cares. Don't you understand that?
The university doesn't care.

01:20:05.389 --> 01:20:07.975
There's nothin' we can do about it.

01:20:08.058 --> 01:20:11.770
We got something good goin',
and I won't let 'em take it away from us.

01:20:11.854 --> 01:20:16.066
Gilbert, don't be a fool.
You'll just get yourself hurt again.

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:18.777
- Big deal.
- Gilbert?

01:20:24.533 --> 01:20:27.119
(? Brass band plays marching tune)

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:43.886
I'd like to introduce the men
that will bring you a homecoming victory

01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:46.513
against State tomorrow.

01:20:46.597 --> 01:20:49.391
At defensive back,
number 38, Kevin O'Leary.

01:20:51.143 --> 01:20:54.688
Offensive guard,
number 64, Rich Valrow.

01:20:56.065 --> 01:20:59.568
At centre,
number 53, Harry Reagan.

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:03.864
- Look who's comin'.
- Where you goin'?

01:21:03.947 --> 01:21:07.493
You went way too far this time,
and you're not gettin' away with it.

01:21:07.576 --> 01:21:12.456
Oh, is that right? Well, let's see if shit floats.
What do you think of that idea?

01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:15.959
Come on! Put me down!
Goddamn! Put me down!

01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:19.088
(Stan) Fire away!

01:21:19.171 --> 01:21:21.507
Now our tri-captains.

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:27.638
Leading the conference in reception,
at wide receiver, number 84, Danny Burke.

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:33.477
Our defensive captain,
number 79, Fred Polowoski - the Ogre.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:40.776
Now our two-time all-American quarterback,
number ten, Stan Gable.

01:21:45.823 --> 01:21:48.659
Hold it, son. Hold it, hold it!

01:21:48.742 --> 01:21:51.370
Leave him alone.
Coach, I said leave him alone.

01:21:51.453 --> 01:21:54.540
What did you say?
I'll break his goddamn neck.

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:58.210
You will do nothing of the sort.
Don't touch that boy.

01:22:02.131 --> 01:22:04.383
Says who?

01:22:05.467 --> 01:22:09.513
Says me... you asshole.

01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:14.560
Hold it, Coach.
You just hold it right there.

01:22:50.429 --> 01:22:52.514
OK, kid.

01:22:53.849 --> 01:22:56.477
Say what you gotta say.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.437
Thanks.

01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:10.699
Uh... I just wanted to say that...
that I'm a nerd.

01:23:11.617 --> 01:23:15.996
And I'm here tonight to stand up
for the rights of other nerds.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:20.501
I mean, all our lives we've been laughed at

01:23:20.584 --> 01:23:23.462
and made to feel inferior.

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:29.593
And tonight those bastards,
they trashed our house.

01:23:30.594 --> 01:23:32.304
Why?

01:23:32.388 --> 01:23:35.140
Because we're smart?

01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:38.060
Because we look different?

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:40.771
Well, we're not.

01:23:41.939 --> 01:23:46.360
I'm a nerd, and... I'm pretty proud of it.

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:54.660
Hi, Gilbert.

01:23:55.536 --> 01:23:57.746
I'm a nerd, too.

01:23:58.789 --> 01:24:01.583
I just found that out tonight.

01:24:01.667 --> 01:24:04.211
We have news for the beautiful people.

01:24:04.294 --> 01:24:08.173
There's a lot more of us than there are of you.

01:24:08.716 --> 01:24:10.926
I know there's alumni here tonight.

01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:16.056
When you went to Adams,
you might have been called a spaz,

01:24:16.515 --> 01:24:20.310
or a dork, or a geek.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.063
Any of you that have ever felt...

01:24:23.147 --> 01:24:27.443
stepped on, left out, picked on, put down,

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.197
whether you think you're a nerd or not,
why don't you come and join us?

01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:33.782
Come on.

01:24:40.164 --> 01:24:41.665
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:44.376
Just join us, cos, uh...

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.961
Hi.

01:24:47.087 --> 01:24:50.841
(Gilbert) No one's really gonna be free
until nerd persecution ends.

01:25:22.623 --> 01:25:27.711
You know, Coach, I think I'm gonna let
these boys live over at the Alpha Beta house,

01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:30.673
while you and your boys rebuild theirs.

01:25:30.756 --> 01:25:34.301
- And where the hell are we gonna live?
- What about us, huh?

01:25:35.052 --> 01:25:37.388
You're jocks, go live in the gym.

01:25:38.889 --> 01:25:41.725
