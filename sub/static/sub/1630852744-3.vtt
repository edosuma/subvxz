<b>Yes, sir -- If you're looking</b>

<b>I think your family</b>
<b>would love South Park.</b>

<b>You can get four times</b>

<b>Yeah, we --</b>

<b>We're up in the mountains</b>
<b>about an hour from Denver...</b>

00:54.221 --> 00:56.657
<b>Do you think you could drive out</b>
<b>from the city this weekend</b>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.458
<b>and I could show you</b>
<b>some properties?</b>

00:58.492 --> 01:01.895
<b>Oh, you have a Tesla?</b>
<b>Oh, how nice.</b>

01:01.929 --> 01:05.399
<b>South Park -- yeah, it's</b>

<b>moving out here to the country.</b>

<b>And the truth is we just don't</b>

<b>Mrs. Cartman,</b>
<b>being a real estate agent</b>

<b>when you show them houses.</b>

01:41.101 --> 01:45.372

<b>My mom is dumb as shit</b>

03:21.969 --> 03:24.171
<b>Have you ever heard of</b>

03:24.204 --> 03:26.139
<b>Well, not really.</b>
<b>Yeah, well, neither had I.</b>

<b>It's more than a good deal,</b>
<b>Butters,</b>

<b>If my mom can be</b>
