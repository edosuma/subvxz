WEBVTT

00:00.244 --> 00:02.282
Previously on Californication...

00:02.649 --> 00:04.883
I want some fucking girls

00:04.918 --> 00:07.286
and some fucking drugs!

00:07.320 --> 00:08.789
Drugs!

00:08.909 --> 00:11.523
I decided to go abroad

00:11.558 --> 00:13.292
for an indeterminate amount
of time.

00:13.326 --> 00:15.494
I want to make
a literary pilgrimage.

00:15.528 --> 00:17.963
How did you even know
where I was just now?

00:17.998 --> 00:19.498
Oh, I tracked your iPhone.

00:19.532 --> 00:22.468
That's really fuckin' weird,
Ophelia.

00:22.502 --> 00:24.370
You know, chlorine kills

00:24.404 --> 00:27.239
99.9% of the sperm,
right?

00:27.307 --> 00:29.308
Fine, I'll get a condom.

00:29.342 --> 00:30.809
Hank, what's up?

00:30.844 --> 00:32.077
Aah!

00:32.112 --> 00:33.512
I want you to meet Gabriel.

00:33.546 --> 00:35.080
- Oh.
Both: [Gasp]

00:35.115 --> 00:37.116
You were getting
sucked off by your sponsor.

00:37.150 --> 00:38.817
Our daughter wants to go
on a literary pilgrimage,

00:38.852 --> 00:40.686
and what kind
of malignant fucking asshole

00:40.720 --> 00:42.421
wouldn't indulge
that sort of behavior?

00:42.455 --> 00:43.822
I think we should let her go.

00:43.857 --> 00:46.325
What are you gonna do?
You gonna slap me again?

00:46.359 --> 00:47.559
[Taser buzzes] Aah!

00:47.594 --> 00:49.161
Ow!

00:49.195 --> 00:51.797
Woman, you are
a fucking fruitcake.

00:51.831 --> 00:53.932
[Taser buzzes]
Oh, my God!

00:53.967 --> 00:55.267
Ophelia!

00:55.335 --> 00:57.269
I had to create Atticus Fetch,

00:57.304 --> 01:00.939
and now I have to kill him
before he kills me.

01:00.974 --> 01:02.141
That doesn't make any sense.

01:09.215 --> 01:12.818
[Breathes deeply]

01:12.852 --> 01:15.654
[Growls]
[Door closes]

01:15.689 --> 01:18.190
Well, that was a short-lived
mid-life career change.

01:18.224 --> 01:20.159
We're foreplaying here,
Charlie.

01:20.193 --> 01:22.161
Not anymore.

01:22.195 --> 01:23.796
Charlie Runkle,

01:23.830 --> 01:26.231
more irritating
than shit on a shoe.

01:26.266 --> 01:28.434
Atticus has quit the business.

01:28.468 --> 01:29.835
Yay!

01:29.869 --> 01:31.203
His wife is divorcing him.

01:31.237 --> 01:32.805
He's pulling out
of the musical.

01:32.839 --> 01:34.540
He's cancelling his world tour.

01:34.574 --> 01:37.042
Bummer.
Both of those disappointed fans.

01:37.077 --> 01:38.711
Fuck the fans, Hank.

01:38.745 --> 01:40.479
This is gonna cost him
tens of millions of dollars.

01:40.513 --> 01:41.714
But no, no, no.

01:41.748 --> 01:43.716
He wants to concentrate
on his sobriety

01:43.750 --> 01:45.084
and enlightenment.

01:45.118 --> 01:47.686
He's at fucking Happy Endings!

01:47.721 --> 01:50.522
- Listen, do you think maybe--
- No, Charlie.

01:50.557 --> 01:52.057
You don't even know
what I'm about to say.

01:52.092 --> 01:53.659
You were gonna ask me
to go talk to him for you.

01:53.693 --> 01:55.361
- Would ya, Hank, please?
- No, can't do it.

01:55.395 --> 01:56.862
- Won't do it.
- Of course he will.

01:56.896 --> 01:58.731
- We'll talk to him.
- What the--why, woman?

01:58.765 --> 02:00.332
Because Happy Endings
is no place

02:00.367 --> 02:02.201
for anyone's sobriety
or enlightenment.

02:02.235 --> 02:03.569
That's what I said,

02:03.603 --> 02:04.937
and you negged me
for being negative.

02:04.971 --> 02:07.740
Well, who's being negative now?

02:07.774 --> 02:09.775
I'm not sure.

02:09.809 --> 02:13.112
Atticus Fetch made
some great fucking music

02:13.146 --> 02:14.513
at one time.

02:14.547 --> 02:16.048
And if you were great once,

02:16.082 --> 02:17.316
you can be great again.

02:17.350 --> 02:19.017
Come on.

02:19.052 --> 02:21.353
Let's help this Phoenix
rise from the ashes.

02:21.388 --> 02:23.522
- It'll be so much fun.
- [Sighs]

02:23.556 --> 02:25.057
I promise.

02:25.091 --> 02:26.291
[Giggles]

02:26.326 --> 02:27.793
Oh, God!

02:27.827 --> 02:29.461
I feel so inspired.

02:29.496 --> 02:30.796
I'm gonna go jerk off.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.364
- Run, save yourself.
- Oh, come on.

02:32.399 --> 02:33.732
That shit'll stain your ears.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.401
I can't unhear
that kind of shit.

02:35.435 --> 02:36.735
Ahh.

02:36.770 --> 02:40.739

Quiet, please.

03:45.939 --> 03:48.507
- I'm in the gap.
- Oh, that's cool.

03:48.541 --> 03:49.508
Can you pick me up a polo
and a pair of chinos?

03:49.542 --> 03:51.109
I'll pay you back.

03:51.144 --> 03:54.847
The gap is the space
between my thoughts, Hank.

03:54.881 --> 03:57.049
Oh, so you're forgoing

03:57.083 --> 04:00.285
millions of quatloos
to explore your mental taint?

04:00.320 --> 04:02.521
I don't wanna
make music anymore.

04:02.555 --> 04:05.123
What's the fucking point,
really?

04:05.158 --> 04:08.193
I just want to--

04:08.228 --> 04:11.330
I just wanna garden.

04:11.364 --> 04:12.531
How are you gonna keep

04:12.565 --> 04:14.666
Air Force 69 in the sky
gardening?

04:14.734 --> 04:17.970
I'll fly coach--
business.

04:18.004 --> 04:20.137
That is if I fly at all
anymore.

04:20.173 --> 04:24.009
I-I don't see why I
would ever leave this place.

04:24.043 --> 04:25.844
What about the fans?

04:25.879 --> 04:27.446
[Exhales]

04:27.480 --> 04:29.214
What fans?

04:29.249 --> 04:30.582
You said it yourself, Hank.

04:30.617 --> 04:32.050
I'm a fuckin' dinosaur.

04:32.085 --> 04:33.886
Yeah, but dinosaurs are cool.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.454
You've seen a velociraptor,
right?

04:35.488 --> 04:36.855
It's pretty bad-ass.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.424
Atticus, you're one

04:39.459 --> 04:42.394
of the most iconic artists
in rock history.

04:42.428 --> 04:45.163
You're just going
through a blue period.

04:45.198 --> 04:47.399
I appreciate it, dear girl.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.067
But I should've done
the world a favor

04:49.102 --> 04:51.570
and died young.

04:51.604 --> 04:52.938
Flash him.

04:52.972 --> 04:55.374
Mm.

04:58.711 --> 05:00.546
I'm sorry, I find no joy

05:00.580 --> 05:03.115
in objectifying women anymore.

05:03.149 --> 05:05.384
It's not fun, and it's not fun.

05:05.418 --> 05:06.618
This is worse than I thought.

05:06.653 --> 05:07.886
[Clears throat]

05:07.921 --> 05:09.087
Your tits are powerless.

05:09.122 --> 05:10.389
You're upsetting him.

05:10.423 --> 05:11.757
What are you talking about?

05:11.791 --> 05:13.191
The guy's practically
lobotomized.

05:13.226 --> 05:14.593
I said that you
could visit with him,

05:14.627 --> 05:15.861
but you're getting him
all riled up.

05:15.895 --> 05:17.095
He's very fragile right now.

05:17.130 --> 05:18.530
Which is the perfect time
for you

05:18.565 --> 05:19.865
to swoop in and get
all blowjobby with him.

05:19.899 --> 05:21.300
You should thank me.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.668
Speaking of such things,

05:22.702 --> 05:24.436
do you have any idea
where Richard is?

05:24.470 --> 05:26.538
- Didn't you go to Fist?
- I did, yes.

05:26.573 --> 05:27.973
And they said that he
doesn't work there anymore.

05:28.007 --> 05:30.208
Oh.
Nice place, huh?

05:30.243 --> 05:31.910
Like Disneyland.

05:31.945 --> 05:34.880
Hmm. You're a complicated
individual, aren't you?

05:34.914 --> 05:36.782
The heart wants, Hank.

05:36.816 --> 05:38.050
- Gabriel?
- Yes?

05:38.084 --> 05:39.751
This encounter
has left me feeling

05:39.786 --> 05:41.420
like I'd really like
to use some drugs right now.

05:41.454 --> 05:43.121
Well, Hank has that effect
on people.

05:43.156 --> 05:44.456
Let's talk about it
in my office.

05:44.490 --> 05:46.224
Leave, now.

05:51.197 --> 05:54.066
You gotta quit cogitating,
bitch.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.400
Becca is gonna be fine.

05:55.435 --> 05:57.736
Road trip is a rite of passage.

05:57.770 --> 05:59.738
You gotta have a little faith
in the girl.

05:59.772 --> 06:02.240
Don't say that word,
"Faith."

06:02.275 --> 06:04.676
Oh, Jesus, trouble walking.

06:04.711 --> 06:07.245
Look away. Look away.
Look away.

06:09.482 --> 06:10.682
Ladies?

06:10.717 --> 06:12.851
O-phelia.

06:12.885 --> 06:14.453
What's up, crazy?

06:14.487 --> 06:16.154
Uh, I would like to invite you

06:16.189 --> 06:17.789
to my house for lunch.

06:17.824 --> 06:19.458
Oh, God.
You know what?

06:19.492 --> 06:21.927
I-I gotta--
I gotta help my daughter.

06:21.961 --> 06:23.495
She's going on a road trip.

06:23.529 --> 06:25.664
Yeah, I-I wasn't
inviting you, Karen.

06:25.698 --> 06:28.066
Oh.
Okay.

06:29.702 --> 06:32.671
Um--

06:32.705 --> 06:34.840
- What--
- Good luck.

06:34.874 --> 06:36.708
- Oh, it's like that?
- Yeah, I think--

06:36.743 --> 06:38.677
Yeah.

06:38.711 --> 06:40.879
I have never been able
to penetrate

06:40.913 --> 06:43.715
that woman's dysfunctional
relationship to men.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.585
She is just a lost cause.

06:46.619 --> 06:48.620
But you--
[Sighs]

06:48.688 --> 06:53.392
You are still impressionable.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.227
And I owe you a big apology.

06:55.261 --> 06:56.862
Hey, you know what, O?

06:56.896 --> 06:59.231
Just--let's forgive
and forget.

06:59.265 --> 07:00.532
Please, Marcy.

07:00.566 --> 07:02.200
I-I really wanna
make it up to you.

07:02.235 --> 07:03.635
You know, I-I don't
wanna leave it like this.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.505
I really don't, please.

07:06.539 --> 07:09.074
Pretty please?

07:09.108 --> 07:10.575
I know where you live, Marcy.

07:10.610 --> 07:13.912
[Chuckles]

07:13.946 --> 07:16.381
That's why it's so important
to live first.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.016
Write later.

07:18.051 --> 07:19.885
Pen, paper, laptop--
that shit doesn't matter.

07:19.919 --> 07:22.154
The only tool you need
is right here

07:22.188 --> 07:24.089
between your legs.
[All giggling]

07:24.123 --> 07:26.525
Use it every chance you get.

07:26.559 --> 07:28.994
Do not deny yourself, children.

07:29.028 --> 07:31.363
Follow every instinct,

07:31.397 --> 07:34.833
then sit down
and write about it.

07:34.867 --> 07:39.771
But do not get up
until you expose yourself.

07:39.806 --> 07:43.008
[Cheers and applause]

07:43.042 --> 07:44.576
Thank you, children.

07:44.610 --> 07:47.345
Thank you.
Go forth. Go forth.

07:47.380 --> 07:51.049
[Cheers and applause]

07:51.084 --> 07:53.285
- Batesy!
- Oh, my God, Hank!

07:53.319 --> 07:55.153
- How you doing, Batesy?
- Oh!

07:57.156 --> 07:59.024
Thank you for that.
That was lovely.

07:59.058 --> 08:00.525
- Wow.
- Batesy, this is Faith.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.593
- Batesy, Faith.
- Faith.

08:01.627 --> 08:03.762
- Hello.
- What a beauty you are.

08:03.796 --> 08:05.397
Um, he's very friendly,

08:05.431 --> 08:06.598
- super handsy.
- He's a friendly boy.

08:06.632 --> 08:07.912
Look at you two.
Look at you two.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.035
Dr. Kinsey
would be very confused

08:10.069 --> 08:11.603
by my meter reading right now.

08:11.637 --> 08:13.605
- That's--that's a compliment.
- Hmm.

08:13.639 --> 08:15.240
Oh, these
are my teaching assistants

08:15.274 --> 08:18.376
Rodrigo and Gabriela.

08:18.411 --> 08:21.113
You know, give us a moment,
kittens, go warm the bed.

08:21.147 --> 08:22.748
Unless, of course,
you two care to join us.

08:22.782 --> 08:24.249
- No.
- Rain check, yeah.

08:24.283 --> 08:25.884
We have no time
for your pansexual shenanigans.

08:25.918 --> 08:27.119
- Little time crunch.
- We have a favor to ask though.

08:27.186 --> 08:28.720
Oh, anything, you know that.

08:28.788 --> 08:32.157
We need to sneak some drugs
into rehab.

08:32.191 --> 08:34.458
That sounds fun.
How can I help?

08:34.494 --> 08:36.193
You can distract Gabriel.

08:36.229 --> 08:38.563
Gabriel, oh, my gosh,
that dear boy.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.499
That does sound
like an adventure.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.534
Let's do it.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.903
Listen, once again, Marcy,
I apologize.

08:44.937 --> 08:49.708
My behavior was childish
and uncalled for.

08:51.177 --> 08:54.246
You know what, man?
It's okay.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.814
There was no permanent damage.

08:55.848 --> 08:58.784
And at the very least,
it was funny

08:58.818 --> 09:01.119
watching Runks
piss himself, right?

09:01.154 --> 09:02.888
[Chuckles]

09:02.922 --> 09:05.323
Marcy?

09:05.358 --> 09:07.192
I have a confession to make.

09:07.226 --> 09:09.094
I'm scared.

09:09.128 --> 09:10.695
[Exhales] Don't be.

09:10.730 --> 09:13.265
If you could look
into my heart right now--

09:13.299 --> 09:16.835
if you could see
the expansive feelings

09:16.869 --> 09:18.270
that I have for you,

09:18.304 --> 09:22.440
um, you wouldn't be afraid.

09:22.475 --> 09:24.009
Well, when you put it that way,

09:24.043 --> 09:25.744
I think I'd be
fuckin' terrified.

09:25.778 --> 09:30.916
Don't you dare belittle me!

09:30.950 --> 09:32.384
Okay, you know,

09:32.418 --> 09:35.153
probably time
for me to go, Ophelia.

09:35.188 --> 09:37.022
- Wait, don't.
- Thanks for the grub.

09:37.056 --> 09:39.124
Please.
Please, don't.

09:39.158 --> 09:41.092
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Ophelia,

09:41.127 --> 09:44.496
but you're just
a wee bit too intense for me.

09:44.530 --> 09:46.398
I know, I know.

09:46.432 --> 09:48.667
It's this lifestyle
that I've chosen for myself.

09:48.701 --> 09:50.702
I'm so lonely.

09:50.736 --> 09:54.673
Well, I hate to say it,
Ophelia,

09:54.707 --> 09:58.210
but methinks
you need to get laid.

09:58.277 --> 09:59.978
I think you're right.

10:00.012 --> 10:01.680
Well, that's so great.

10:01.714 --> 10:04.015
Let me set you up with someone.

10:04.050 --> 10:05.317
What about Stu?

10:05.351 --> 10:06.718
Dude's a sweetheart,

10:06.752 --> 10:07.986
and he's hung
like a fuckin' hog.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.254
And he's got big balls.

10:09.288 --> 10:11.590
Marcy, that is disgusting!

10:11.624 --> 10:13.258
And he cheated on you.

10:13.292 --> 10:15.660
Yeah, he cheated on me,
not you.

10:15.695 --> 10:18.330
[Sighs] Oh,
you are not getting the point.

10:18.364 --> 10:22.033
I want you.

10:22.068 --> 10:24.970
Okay.
Okay.

10:25.004 --> 10:26.838
So you are a dyke.

10:26.906 --> 10:28.240
Why didn't you say so?

10:28.274 --> 10:29.741
I am totally cool
with that shit.

10:29.775 --> 10:31.743
I'm not a lesbian, Marcy.

10:31.777 --> 10:36.214
I just love you.

10:36.249 --> 10:38.717
[Sighs] Oh, fucksticks.

10:38.751 --> 10:40.619
I want you
to be my first, Marcy--

10:40.653 --> 10:41.853
aside from the Puerto Rican

10:41.921 --> 10:43.955
who fouled my anus
when I was 23.

10:43.990 --> 10:45.390
Okay, that's...
[Chuckles]

10:45.424 --> 10:47.192
really flattering, Ophelia.

10:47.226 --> 10:49.261
And I've been with women.

10:49.328 --> 10:51.263
And that can be really hot
and everything,

10:51.297 --> 10:54.366
but I just don't think
that you and me

10:54.400 --> 10:57.035
have that kind of chemistry.

10:57.069 --> 10:59.604
Well, that's disappointing.

10:59.639 --> 11:01.740
So you'll just spread your legs

11:01.774 --> 11:03.808
for every snake in the garden,

11:03.843 --> 11:05.744
but you won't even consider

11:05.778 --> 11:09.848
my precious flower?

11:09.882 --> 11:12.217
Yeah, pretty much.

11:12.251 --> 11:15.887
Sorry.

11:15.922 --> 11:18.256
Wait, Marcy, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.991
I understand.

11:20.026 --> 11:22.327
You do?

11:22.361 --> 11:24.562
I'm glad.
Okay.

11:24.597 --> 11:27.399
Okay, so, um,
thank you for coming.

11:27.433 --> 11:28.967
Okay.

11:29.001 --> 11:31.670
And let's do this again.

11:31.704 --> 11:34.005
Sure.
Thank you.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.875
[Taser buzzes]
[Grunts]

11:39.312 --> 11:42.013
I've got you, my darling.

11:42.048 --> 11:43.415
For God's sake,

11:43.449 --> 11:44.816
put them in the right order
this time.

11:44.850 --> 11:46.351
Red, pink, red, pink.

11:46.385 --> 11:47.686
And you can just bend over,

11:47.720 --> 11:48.687
and you can plant
those impatiens.

11:48.721 --> 11:49.955
That's great.

11:49.989 --> 11:51.156
Maybe pull some
of those weeds out--

11:51.190 --> 11:52.691
[Clears throat]

11:52.725 --> 11:54.693
No, no, no, no, no.
You need to leave now.

11:54.727 --> 11:56.695
You are endangering
the sober happiness

11:56.729 --> 11:59.030
of everyone--
Richard!

11:59.065 --> 12:01.099
Gabriel, my dear boy.

12:01.133 --> 12:03.601
I feel like a child
on Christmas morning.

12:03.636 --> 12:04.869
Thank you so much, Hank!

12:04.904 --> 12:06.471
You're welcome, Gaby baby.

12:06.505 --> 12:08.273
We just need to go talk
to Atticus for a minute.

12:08.307 --> 12:09.507
Yeah, sure,
do whatever you want.

12:09.542 --> 12:10.875
Thank you.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.610
- Come to papa.
- Ahh.

12:12.645 --> 12:14.179
Come to papa.

12:14.213 --> 12:17.449
[Smacks lips] Shoo.

12:17.483 --> 12:19.551
Ahh.

12:19.585 --> 12:21.386
[TV turns on]

12:21.420 --> 12:24.622
- [Chuckles]
- Ooh.

12:24.657 --> 12:26.191
[Sighs] Ahh, yes.

12:26.225 --> 12:27.559
[Clears throat]

12:27.593 --> 12:29.894
It's been too long, my friend.

12:29.929 --> 12:31.296
[Cell phone chimes]

12:31.330 --> 12:35.300
[Girls giggling on TV]

12:35.334 --> 12:37.135
Ugh.
Now what?

12:39.338 --> 12:40.705
[Gasps] Hank!

12:40.740 --> 12:42.841
Hello, rapist.
We meet again.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.709
- Ahh!
- Hey, whoa.

12:44.744 --> 12:46.644
Feed me
some fucking inches, dude,

12:46.679 --> 12:48.680
- right fucking now.
- Aah, no.

12:48.714 --> 12:50.148
Tweaker chick, be cool.

12:50.182 --> 12:52.050
What are you looking at,
skank, huh?

12:52.084 --> 12:53.351
You think
you're better than me?

12:53.386 --> 12:54.986
No, no, not better,
just different.

12:55.021 --> 12:56.688
I'll poke your eyes out
and do a puppet show

12:56.722 --> 12:58.890
- with your balls, bitch.
- That's sweet.

12:58.924 --> 13:00.825
Your mother
sucks cocks in hell.

13:00.860 --> 13:03.061
[Squealing] I love you.

13:07.299 --> 13:09.267
We'd like to speak with you
privately.

13:09.301 --> 13:11.102
Anything you have to say to me

13:11.137 --> 13:12.904
can be said
in front of the group.

13:12.938 --> 13:15.440
These people are my friends,

13:15.474 --> 13:19.010
fellow soldiers in the war
against substance abuse.

13:19.078 --> 13:20.845
Not this.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.381
Then I'm afraid you won't
be talking to me today.

13:30.623 --> 13:34.092
[Screams]

13:34.126 --> 13:40.932
[Indistinct yelling]

13:40.966 --> 13:42.967
Get off of me,
you fucking fucks.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.903
- Stop, wait.
- This is so mean.

13:44.937 --> 13:46.604
Why are you doing this to me?

13:46.639 --> 13:47.939
What happened to you, man?

13:47.973 --> 13:49.641
You used to be
decadence incarnate.

13:49.675 --> 13:51.209
Yeah, well,
but look where that got me.

13:51.243 --> 13:53.611
My immortal beloved left me.

13:53.646 --> 13:55.213
No, she left you
because you wouldn't stop

13:55.247 --> 13:56.381
fucking other women.

13:56.415 --> 13:57.816
The drugs made me do it!

13:57.850 --> 13:59.551
No, the drugs did not
make you do it.

13:59.585 --> 14:01.086
- You made you do it.
- [Whimpers]

14:01.120 --> 14:02.921
Me made me do that.
[Crying]

14:02.955 --> 14:05.557
Me made me do it.

14:05.591 --> 14:07.959
Atticus, there is nothing wrong

14:07.993 --> 14:09.828
with a little recreational
occasional drug use

14:09.862 --> 14:11.262
or fucking anyone that wants

14:11.330 --> 14:12.964
to fuck you right back.

14:12.998 --> 14:15.300
You are a rock star.

14:15.334 --> 14:18.736
You deserve it and more.

14:18.771 --> 14:21.339
You have my attention.

14:23.042 --> 14:25.210
I've looked up to you
for years, Atticus.

14:25.244 --> 14:27.579
I'm quite possibly
your biggest fan.

14:27.613 --> 14:29.948
In fact, I was just about
to hit the road

14:29.982 --> 14:32.016
and follow you
from show to show.

14:32.051 --> 14:33.918
This is not just about me.

14:33.953 --> 14:35.653
Think of all the fans
out there.

14:35.688 --> 14:37.422
We have tickets to your shows.

14:37.456 --> 14:38.957
And we've been staying up late
every night,

14:38.991 --> 14:41.292
wondering what it'll be like
to see you live.

14:41.327 --> 14:43.361
What song will he open with?

14:43.395 --> 14:45.930
What will the stage look like?

14:45.965 --> 14:48.366
Well, I'm opening
for Marilyn Manson,

14:48.400 --> 14:50.468
so it won't be
as elaborate as usual.

14:50.503 --> 14:51.970
Hey, that's a killer
double bill.

14:52.004 --> 14:53.671
Technically
we're co-headlining.

14:53.706 --> 14:55.106
But he closes the show
every night,

14:55.174 --> 14:56.774
which makes him the headliner.

14:56.809 --> 14:58.977
I remember when that
cocky teabagging motherfucker

14:59.011 --> 15:00.612
opened for me.

15:00.646 --> 15:02.046
Use this as an opportunity

15:02.081 --> 15:04.115
to show these kids
how it's done.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.583
Don't be a fucking quitter.

15:05.618 --> 15:07.051
It's unbecoming.

15:07.086 --> 15:09.988
Call it a comeback.

15:13.159 --> 15:15.660
Oh, child.

15:15.694 --> 15:17.996
Tell me, what song
would you like me to open with?

15:18.030 --> 15:22.534
What would please you,
sweet, sweet child?

15:22.568 --> 15:24.669
[Mumbles] <i>Step and Fetch It.</i>

15:24.703 --> 15:26.471
<i>Step and Fetch It.</i>

15:26.505 --> 15:27.505
Well, obviously.

15:27.540 --> 15:28.973
All: Obviously.

15:29.008 --> 15:30.542
Come on.
That's a no-brainer.

15:30.576 --> 15:32.710
You guys are making
a lot of sense right now.

15:32.745 --> 15:35.046
I'm not sure if I'm ready
to sacrifice

15:35.080 --> 15:37.215
my hard-won sobriety
just yet,

15:37.249 --> 15:41.319
but we should talk further...

15:41.353 --> 15:43.922
over a glass of wine.

15:43.956 --> 15:46.224
[Doorbell rings]

15:49.228 --> 15:50.595
What is it, pig?

15:50.629 --> 15:53.498
- Is Marcy here?
- No.

15:53.532 --> 15:55.266
Are you sure?
Because--

15:55.301 --> 15:57.368
She was here.
She was, okay?

15:57.403 --> 15:58.903
She left, ten minutes ago.

15:58.938 --> 16:02.106
Okay, well, uh...

16:02.141 --> 16:05.076
her car is still here.

16:05.110 --> 16:09.180
[Laughter]

16:09.215 --> 16:10.582
Okay, I give up.

16:10.616 --> 16:12.116
I'm done lying.

16:12.151 --> 16:13.718
[Laughs]

16:13.752 --> 16:15.720
Come in.

16:15.754 --> 16:18.089
You're not gonna
tase me again, are you?

16:18.123 --> 16:20.158
No, of course not.

16:22.228 --> 16:23.861
[Taser buzzes]

16:27.900 --> 16:30.368
[Knock at door]

16:30.402 --> 16:32.403
What is it?
I'm in the middle of something.

16:32.438 --> 16:35.273
You have to see this
for yourself, sir.

16:37.443 --> 16:40.812
Can't imagine
what the commotion is.

16:40.846 --> 16:42.714
[Snorting]

Oh, nonsense, son.

16:55.828 --> 16:57.161

16:57.196 --> 16:58.696
Come on, Gaby baby,

16:58.731 --> 17:00.098
all the cool kids are doing it.

17:00.132 --> 17:02.000
Ahh.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.137
Hello.

17:06.171 --> 17:08.406
It's the right thing
to do, Gabriel.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.807
Just treat yourself.

17:09.842 --> 17:11.476
You've been a good boy, kitten.

17:11.510 --> 17:14.779
You've been a very good boy.

17:14.813 --> 17:17.115
Take a bite out of that peach.

dribble down your chin.

Yeah.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.508
I'm fine.

18:17.543 --> 18:19.977
It's just I'm really pissed
at the crazy bitch.

18:20.012 --> 18:22.213
That tasing shit
really fuckin' hurts.

18:22.247 --> 18:25.683
I know, right?
This is my third time.

18:25.718 --> 18:27.585
[Sighs]

18:31.790 --> 18:33.658
Thanks for coming
to get me, Runks.

18:33.692 --> 18:36.494
Of course.
I got your text.

18:36.528 --> 18:38.396
I really freaked out.

18:38.430 --> 18:40.732
Well, I guess
with all this time

18:40.766 --> 18:43.267
and all the punani in between,

18:43.302 --> 18:44.535
you still love me, huh?

18:44.570 --> 18:48.206
Yes, I do.
Very much so.

18:51.243 --> 18:53.811
And I guess I still love you,

18:53.846 --> 18:56.714
- you dumb fuck.
- Whoa, stop the clock. You do?

18:56.749 --> 18:58.716
[Sighs]

18:58.751 --> 19:00.518
After we called it quits,

19:00.552 --> 19:02.286
things got all weird
and pear-shaped.

19:02.321 --> 19:06.090
And then I took that crazy
fucking detour with Stu.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.126
And we had some good times,

19:08.160 --> 19:12.163
but nothing felt right
ever since.

19:12.231 --> 19:15.333
That's exactly how I feel.

19:15.367 --> 19:17.702
And you're right, you know?
It was fun.

19:17.736 --> 19:19.816
Because, man, I mean,
some of the sex that I've had--

19:19.838 --> 19:23.241
Don't! Don't!
Don't press your luck, Charlie.

19:23.275 --> 19:25.276
Right.
Right, sorry.

19:25.310 --> 19:30.047
[Laughs]
And this little piggy had none.

19:30.082 --> 19:32.917
Aah! No!

19:32.951 --> 19:35.319
- No!
- Ophelia! Ophelia!

19:35.354 --> 19:37.989
Why the fuck
did you chain me up

19:38.023 --> 19:39.390
next to this fucking worm?

19:39.425 --> 19:41.325
You know that I hate
his fucking guts.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.662
Oh, Marcy.
That's the spirit!

19:44.696 --> 19:45.963
You know what?

19:45.998 --> 19:47.665
I was gonna fuckin' chop off

19:47.699 --> 19:50.501
his pathetic, little
fuckin' excuse for a penis

19:50.536 --> 19:52.837
and feed it to my cats.

19:52.871 --> 19:54.472
But maybe you should do it.

19:54.506 --> 19:55.907
Yeah, maybe I should.

19:55.941 --> 19:57.508
I'll cut it off.
I'll eat it myself.

19:57.543 --> 19:58.910
- Oh!
- Okay?

19:58.944 --> 20:00.144
I got a better idea.

20:00.179 --> 20:01.979
Let's make soup out of it.

20:02.014 --> 20:04.849
- Fuck yeah, cock soup!
- Yeah.

20:04.883 --> 20:06.350
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, okay.

20:06.385 --> 20:09.654
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

20:09.688 --> 20:12.490
- There you go.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

20:12.524 --> 20:14.625
That's great.
That's really...

20:14.660 --> 20:16.694
- Good!
- [Grunts] Ow!

20:16.728 --> 20:18.296
I'm not gonna cut his dick off,

20:18.330 --> 20:19.630
you crazy bitch.

20:19.665 --> 20:21.365
And being a fucking feminist

20:21.400 --> 20:24.802
is not about castrating men,
you kooky cunt.

20:24.837 --> 20:27.371
It's about learning to coexist

20:27.406 --> 20:29.006
with these dumb fucks.

20:29.041 --> 20:32.677
And sucking a dick
every once in a while

20:32.711 --> 20:36.347
is not about surrendering
your fuckin' sheness--

20:36.381 --> 20:38.716
which isn't even a word.

20:40.419 --> 20:42.153
And your books are unreadable.

20:42.187 --> 20:44.555
That was
a very beautiful speech, Marcy.

20:44.590 --> 20:46.824
You're a very strong
and beautiful woman.

20:46.859 --> 20:49.994
And you should be fuckin' lucky

20:50.028 --> 20:53.331
you made any cash
off of them at all.

20:53.365 --> 20:54.565
[Taser buzzes]
Oh, fuck!

20:54.600 --> 20:57.068
That fuckin' hurts!

20:57.102 --> 20:58.836
Damn it!
[Taser buzzes]

20:58.871 --> 21:00.238
[Grunts]

21:00.272 --> 21:03.207
Oh, Jesus, that was fun.

21:03.242 --> 21:06.043
[Panting]
Oh, my God.

21:06.078 --> 21:07.378
Can I try?

21:07.412 --> 21:09.714
- No!
- What?

21:09.748 --> 21:11.048
Okay, just once.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.284
We don't wanna kill her.

21:13.352 --> 21:15.086
Just do one more--
[Taser buzzes]

21:15.120 --> 21:16.521
- Okay!
- Whoo-hoo!

21:16.555 --> 21:18.189
- That is a lot of fun.
- It worked.

21:18.223 --> 21:19.357
That's why I'm gonna
do it one more time.

21:19.391 --> 21:20.992
On the toe.
[Taser buzzes]

21:21.026 --> 21:22.426
[Laughter]

21:22.461 --> 21:24.262
â™ª That deaf, dumb, and blind kid â™ª

21:24.296 --> 21:28.266
â™ª sure plays a mean pinball â™ª

21:31.637 --> 21:33.471
â™ª Hey, hey

21:33.505 --> 21:35.506
â™ª he is a pinball wizard â™ª

21:35.541 --> 21:37.208
â™ª there's got to be a twist â™ª

21:37.242 --> 21:39.176
â™ª he's a pinball wizard

21:39.211 --> 21:43.548
â™ª he's got
such a supple wrist â™ª

21:43.582 --> 21:45.049
â™ª ah

21:45.083 --> 21:47.752
â™ª How do you think he does it? â™ª

21:47.786 --> 21:49.220
I don't know.

21:49.254 --> 21:50.721
â™ª Yeah, what made him
so good? â™ª

21:50.789 --> 21:53.958
What happened to you guys?

21:53.992 --> 21:54.959
Whoo!

21:54.993 --> 21:57.428
Ophelia Robins chained me

21:57.462 --> 21:59.263
to a radiator in my prannies.

21:59.298 --> 22:00.798
- What?
- Excellent, continue.

22:00.832 --> 22:04.368
And then Runks
rescued me--kinda, sorta.

22:04.403 --> 22:06.604
- Oh, that is so romantic.
- [Laughs] Oh.

22:06.638 --> 22:08.773
- My man.
- I know, right?

22:08.807 --> 22:10.875
And--

22:10.909 --> 22:12.443
we're getting married!

22:12.477 --> 22:13.844
- No!
- The Runkles!

22:13.879 --> 22:15.746
- Well, remarried.
- No, you're not.

22:15.781 --> 22:17.548
I need you on tour with me,
you motherfucker.

22:17.616 --> 22:19.717
- I thought the tour was off.
- Not anymore.

22:19.751 --> 22:21.819
I'm back on drugs,
and I'm better than ever.

22:21.853 --> 22:23.387
Yeah, he is!

22:23.422 --> 22:25.823
I-I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

22:25.857 --> 22:28.893
So I will take a day off
to get remarried.

22:28.927 --> 22:31.062
No. I tell you
what I will do though,

22:31.096 --> 22:32.964
for both of you,

22:33.031 --> 22:34.966
I'll fuckin' marry you fuckers

22:35.000 --> 22:37.368
on the stage, at the Greek!

22:37.436 --> 22:38.836
I'm a licensed minister.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.538
Of course you are.

22:40.572 --> 22:42.506
What do you think?

22:42.541 --> 22:45.242
Fuck yeah.
Why not?

22:45.277 --> 22:46.944
And then you can bring
your spunky, little fuck bunny

22:46.979 --> 22:49.013
up on the road with us,
and I can finish eating

22:49.047 --> 22:51.749
that chocolate bar out of
her sweet, little, girly bits.

22:51.783 --> 22:52.984
- Okay.
- It's good to be the king!

22:53.051 --> 22:54.285
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!

22:54.319 --> 22:56.087
- You guys are coming, right?
- What?

22:56.121 --> 22:57.455
On tour.

22:57.489 --> 22:59.123
We gotta keep writing
this musical.

22:59.157 --> 23:01.158
I write incredibly well
on tour.

23:01.193 --> 23:02.860
I find it inspiring.

23:02.894 --> 23:04.695
Sounds like an adventure.

23:04.730 --> 23:06.964
Think about it,
and then say yes.

23:06.999 --> 23:09.967
I'm gonna go to bed and show
this dedicated fan girl

23:10.002 --> 23:13.537
what it's like to be penetrated
by a ginger God.

23:13.572 --> 23:14.805
No, you are gonna see
what it's like

23:14.840 --> 23:16.774
to get raped by a tweaker!

23:16.808 --> 23:19.010
- Watch that, shit's intense.
- Holy shit.

23:19.044 --> 23:20.324
One of us
is gonna bleed tonight,

23:20.345 --> 23:21.846
and I ain't gonna be me.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.482
I can hardly wait.

23:35.594 --> 23:38.529
I'm gonna miss you, squirt.
[Kisses]

23:38.563 --> 23:40.731
I'll miss you too, dad.

23:40.766 --> 23:43.167
- But it's time to go.
- Yeah.

23:43.201 --> 23:44.568
I need a change of scenery.

23:44.603 --> 23:45.836
I know that feeling.

23:45.871 --> 23:47.605
So hit the road.

23:47.639 --> 23:49.240
What's keeping you?

23:49.274 --> 23:51.308
The truth?

23:51.343 --> 23:53.044
I guess I'm always hoping
that your mom

23:53.111 --> 23:56.247
will take me back,
give me another chance.

23:56.281 --> 23:58.382
Maybe that's your problem, dad.

23:58.417 --> 24:01.085
You see it as winning her back.

24:01.119 --> 24:03.387
But there's no winning
in this game.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.557
You're not some white knight
on a steed.

24:06.591 --> 24:09.427
She's not
some fairy tale princess.

24:09.461 --> 24:13.164
She's just
as fucked up as you are...

24:13.198 --> 24:15.366
and just as incredible.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.767
You know what's funny?

24:16.802 --> 24:18.102
What?

24:18.136 --> 24:19.737
You talk a good game
about living,

24:19.771 --> 24:21.372
loving and fucking
and fighting,

24:21.406 --> 24:23.040
but this whole time,

24:23.075 --> 24:25.543
I've only seen you
with that guy--

24:25.577 --> 24:27.511
troll doll.

24:27.546 --> 24:30.948
Yeah, I can't seem
to scrape him off my shoe.

24:30.982 --> 24:33.150
Uh-oh, that's like the beginning

24:33.185 --> 24:36.120
to every great love story
I know.

24:36.154 --> 24:41.258
He's one of the good guys, dad.

24:41.293 --> 24:42.860
He told me he loved me
last night.

24:42.894 --> 24:44.428
Of course he did.

24:44.463 --> 24:47.465
What took him so long?

24:49.901 --> 24:51.781
Does she have any allergies
I should know about?

24:51.803 --> 24:55.773
Uh, penicillin and lameness.

24:55.807 --> 24:57.074
I know I've failed to make

24:57.109 --> 24:58.442
an excellent impression
on you, sir.

24:58.477 --> 24:59.844
Yeah.

24:59.878 --> 25:01.879
But I really do
enjoy your daughter.

25:01.913 --> 25:03.647
I'm sorry.
"Enjoy" sounds dirty.

25:03.682 --> 25:05.716
And I do enjoy her in that way,
you know, like, sexually.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.451
No.
No, no, no.

25:07.486 --> 25:09.086
But I'm really talking
about the other way, you know?

25:09.121 --> 25:10.654
Like, I love her brain.

25:10.689 --> 25:13.124
She's better than me
and smarter than me.

25:13.158 --> 25:15.226
And I'd like to support
and nurture that

25:15.260 --> 25:17.928
for as long as she'll let me.

25:17.963 --> 25:20.164
Sorry, I guess this is just
my long-winded way of saying

25:20.165 --> 25:23.567
I'll take very good care
of your daughter, sir.

25:23.602 --> 25:29.507
â™ª Broken skyline
movin' through the airport â™ª

25:29.541 --> 25:33.110
I'm gonna miss you so much.

25:33.145 --> 25:35.446
You better, or I'll rip
that stupid fucking hair

25:35.480 --> 25:37.314
- right out of your head.
- [Gasps]

25:37.349 --> 25:38.315
[Laughs]

25:38.350 --> 25:41.986
I'm so proud of you.

25:42.020 --> 25:45.556
â™ª

25:45.624 --> 25:49.260
â™ª Broken skyline

25:49.294 --> 25:53.097
â™ª which way
to love land? â™ª

25:53.131 --> 25:57.168
â™ª which way
to something better? â™ª

25:57.202 --> 25:59.003
â™ª which way
to forgiveness? â™ª

25:59.037 --> 26:01.172
Don't stand still.

26:01.239 --> 26:03.541
Keep moving.

26:07.512 --> 26:11.549
â™ª It's time to move on â™ª

26:11.583 --> 26:12.850
[Engine starts]

26:12.884 --> 26:15.452
â™ª Get going

26:15.487 --> 26:17.021
â™ª what lies ahead

26:17.055 --> 26:21.091
â™ª we don't have no way of knowing â™ª

26:21.126 --> 26:23.027
â™ª

26:23.061 --> 26:27.031
â™ª under my feet, babe â™ª

26:27.065 --> 26:31.202
â™ª grass is growing, yeah â™ª

26:31.236 --> 26:34.872
â™ª it's time to move on â™ª

26:34.906 --> 26:38.242
[Sighs]
You wanna take a walk?

26:38.276 --> 26:41.011
No.
[Crying]

26:41.046 --> 26:43.881
I just wanna go back
to my empty nest and cry.

26:43.915 --> 26:45.716
- You want company?
- No.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.751
I think I need a solo cry.

26:47.786 --> 26:52.489
Oh, that sounds kinda
like code for rubbin' one out.

26:52.524 --> 26:56.026
I'm sorry, I'm just--I'm just
trying to keep it light.

26:56.061 --> 26:59.430
[Sighs] I just
can't believe she's gone.

26:59.464 --> 27:01.498
She's not really gone, Karen.

27:01.533 --> 27:03.067
She wants to be a writer,

27:03.101 --> 27:04.702
which means
she's gonna be unemployed

27:04.736 --> 27:06.270
for the next decade.

27:06.304 --> 27:07.605
And then she's gonna have
to move back home

27:07.639 --> 27:10.341
with one of us, preferably you.

27:10.375 --> 27:13.377
[Sighs] Good.

27:13.411 --> 27:18.549
Watching her go,
I don't know, it kinda--

27:18.583 --> 27:21.719
it kinda feels like
the end of something.

27:21.753 --> 27:25.389
It makes you wonder.

27:25.423 --> 27:26.035
About?

27:31.129 --> 27:32.563
If she was the only thing

27:32.597 --> 27:34.615
that was still keeping us
together.

27:36.668 --> 27:39.370
â™ª Breaking up a dogfight â™ª

27:39.404 --> 27:44.441
â™ª like a deer
in the headlights â™ª

27:44.476 --> 27:48.145
â™ª frozen in real time â™ª

27:48.179 --> 27:51.148
â™ª I'm losin' my mind

27:55.420 --> 27:58.989
â™ª time to move on

27:59.024 --> 28:02.326
â™ª to get going

28:02.360 --> 28:04.528
â™ª what lies ahead

28:04.562 --> 28:10.401
â™ª we don't have
no way of knowing â™ª

28:10.435 --> 28:14.438
