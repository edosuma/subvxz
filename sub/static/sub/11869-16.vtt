00:01.335 --> 00:03.291
CARTER:
Previously on Eureka...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.046
Your criminal record
disqualifies you

00:05.172 --> 00:06.708
from being in
the Astraeus Project.

00:06.882 --> 00:07.837
Yeah, I know.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.218
Allison has found
something in my heart.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.926
l'm cut from
mission selection.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.420
I'd still like to
take you to dinner.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.177
Something more
off-the-clock
might be nice.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.307
So, you guys
really went out?

00:20.062 --> 00:21.848
BEVERLY: The BBI interface
with Allison

00:21.980 --> 00:24.016
becomes less stable
the longer I use it.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.686
I'd really prefer
not to get stuck
inside her head.

00:28.904 --> 00:29.893
Beveny?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.066
Beverly doesn't
live here anymore.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.609
(BEEPING)

00:41.500 --> 00:45.459
Hey, was I dreaming
or did I hear
yelling last night?

00:45.629 --> 00:48.211
Oh, uh, a bunch
of commandos
abducted Jo.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.580
Coffee?

00:50.008 --> 00:51.088
Sure.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.544
Ooh, you made me
breakfast.
My finest ever.

00:55.681 --> 00:56.636
Mmm.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.427
SARAH: Ahem.
Well, SARAH and I
had a...

00:59.643 --> 01:00.598
SARAH did most...

01:00.727 --> 01:02.228
I put the greens down.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.060
It's the
presentation
that sells it.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.430
I'd like to think so.
So what are you
doing today?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.519
Uh, l have a meeting
with Senator Wen at G.D.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.439
But I think I will be
back in time for lunch,
so I'm thinking

01:11.572 --> 01:13.028
another picnic by the lake.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.444
Uh, actually, I am
planning on going
back to work today.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.072
Two weeks of
doting is about all
that I can handle.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.910
Well, two weeks since
you were brain-jacked.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.124
And I don't dote.

01:26.336 --> 01:29.043
Oh, you dote.
I mean, I love
that you dote.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.753
Butjust not so much.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.043
Besides, the kids
are coming back from
my mom's tomorrow, so...

01:33.218 --> 01:34.458
Thursday.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.094
No, today is Wed...
Thursday.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.971
See? Brain-jacked.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.136
I'm fine, really.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.637
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

01:47.357 --> 01:49.018
LARRY: Tick tock, people.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.895
Tick tock.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.064
No pressure.
Oh, God.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.527
And time's up,
Astraeus candidates.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.774
Pencils down.

01:59.745 --> 02:00.905
Easy on the stairs.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.118
(SIGHS) Jack.
l'm doting, right.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.987
SENATOR WEN: Sheriff.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.113
Dr. Blake.
Hi.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.490
It's good to see
you up and about.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.834
Enjoying your
time off?
Uh, yes, lwas.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.463
But I'm ready
to get back to work.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.539
Oh, no need to rush.
Enjoy your you time.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.466
(CHUCKLES) Well, thank you.
I appreciate your
understanding.

02:16.678 --> 02:17.633
But G.D. still needs...

02:17.763 --> 02:20.379
Sorry, sometimes I forget to
turn off the politician speak.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.256
It wasn't understanding.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.603
I'm not reinstating
you just yet.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.057
Oh.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.896
Listen, the trauma
you experienced

02:30.025 --> 02:31.515
would shake
anyone's confidence.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.063
Well, my confidence
isn't shaken, Senator.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.235
Mine is.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.030
I just want to be sure
that you're ready.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.660
No need to rush.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.412
Feel free to use
the facilities, Allison.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.531
Maybe take a day
at the spa.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.036
Sheriff, you're with me.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.917
I guess I'm with her.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.756
Uh, I'll find you later.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.975
Miss Lupo.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.395
Your test results
are ready.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.852
Wow, that was fast.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.189
Titan waits
for no one.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.648
Oh.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.322
Okay.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.068
Quick, quick,
like a bandage.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.161
lt'll hurt less.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.123
lpassed.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.587
lpassed!

03:36.842 --> 03:40.710
I passed, I passed, I passed,
I passed, I passed!

03:40.846 --> 03:45.135
I passed, I passed, I passed,
I passed, I passed!

03:45.267 --> 03:46.677
(CHUCKLING)

03:46.810 --> 03:48.050
I knew you would.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.638
I didn't.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.929
l was half asleep when
they brought me in here.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.023
Yeah, well,
any tool can ace
orbital dynamics

03:55.152 --> 03:56.983
with eight hours sleep
and three cups of coffee.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.068
That's why they yank you
in the middle of the night.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.062
They want to see what
you're really made of.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.032
So you should
probably resume your
little happy dance.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.572
Besides, I was
kind of enjoying it.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.997
You know, I kind of wish
that you were going.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.244
Oh, I'm going to Titan.
Hmm?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.171
They just don't
know it yet.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.920
(BEEPING)
Oh. Oh.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.089
Level Q?

04:26.641 --> 04:27.767
Where the hell's that?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.226
SENATOR WEN:
Morning, everyone.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.344
Morning.
Morning, Senator.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.269
Should I sit?
Just stand there
and look pretty.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.392
You've all been
doing yeoman's work

04:38.528 --> 04:39.984
on your
Astraeus assignments,

04:40.113 --> 04:42.820
but I'm afraid
you're behind schedule.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.898
Actually, I should
have construction

04:45.035 --> 04:47.117
of the ship's hull
completed right on track.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.862
Not according
to the new schedule.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.037
Oh.

04:55.170 --> 04:58.082
I'm afraid you're going to
have to accelerate things
a bit, Dr. Sanagustin.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.131
Okay, I can push our
guys to finish ASAP.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.052
Oh, excellent.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.131
Where's Dr. Fung?

05:06.598 --> 05:07.587
Oh, uh...

Sorry, everybody.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.107
My bad.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.024
I'm guessing that's him.
Yeah.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.236
He's been having some issues

05:30.372 --> 05:33.034
with his interstellar
communications system.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.535
Well, uh, on that note,
I'll let you get back to work.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.669
Yeah, I should
do the same.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.538
Oh, you
are working.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.874
For me.

05:44.094 --> 05:48.007
Things will be heating up
around here with the
tighter deadlines.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.839
I'd appreciate your help
with extra security.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.139
Well, I'd love to,
but, uh, I'm the
town sheriff.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.929
So, I have
sheriffy things to do.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.814
That's politician speak
for "You have to."

06:00.360 --> 06:01.975
Paper work's
already done.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.190
Oh, and, um,
I'd appreciate it
if you'd wear a suit.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.526
Finally.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.703
What took you
solong?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.292
This level
is amazing.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.503
ldidn't even know G.D.
went this deep.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.212
So, um, what's up?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.586
Um, you tell us.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.301
We got texts from you
to come down here.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.172
No, you sent me a text
to come down here.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.147
FARGO: Someone, anyone!
Let us out!

06:44.446 --> 06:46.903
Yeah, there's
no reception here, guys.

06:47.032 --> 06:47.987
(BEEPING)

06:48.116 --> 06:49.947
LARRY: Congratulations,
Astraeus candidates,

06:50.076 --> 06:51.941
on making it
to the next round.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.406
Psychological
stress testing.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.491
Oh, I've read
about this.
(CHUCKLES)

06:56.625 --> 06:58.741
They put us
in isolation
for days on end.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.869
Give us challenging tasks
that test our mettle
at every turn.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.036
Where the
strong survive,

07:03.173 --> 07:05.380
and the weak get discarded
like yesterday's trash.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.162
In front of everyone?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.539
Test uniforms
will be provided.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.340
HOLLY: One of the things we're
going to have to deal with

07:49.469 --> 07:51.425
on the mission
is lack of privacy.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.964
This is our first test.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.469
l for one believe
that the human body
is a beautiful thing.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.388
And I am happy to share it.

Oh, no!
No sharing, no!

We're going to space.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.695
Okay.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.984

just face our lockers
and agree to no peeking?

Great, great stuff.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.742
Thank you. I take it
Senator Wen brought you in.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.539
When she calls, I heed.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.536
This place is so much cooler
than the Mayo Clinic.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.667
You know, if I'd known
you were coming, I'd
have cleaned up a bit.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.416
Well, that's fine.
If you could just fill me in
on everything that I missed.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.215
Sorry. Uh,
Senator Wen's orders.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.510
l was told about
your incident.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.260

you're no-fly.

Now, uh, I'm about
to start a private

How you feeling?
Well, like everyone
thinks that I'm crazy.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.089
Uh, tell me
that you were not
wearing that before.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.378
No, Senator Wen
asked me

09:54.511 --> 09:56.502
to fill in for Jo
while she's doing
some stress test.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.253
I'm not a tie guy.
This is...

09:58.723 --> 10:00.759
Yeah, well, maybe
you should tighten it.

A lot.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.009
l'm sensing hostility.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.181
Apparently,
everyone thinks that
my brain is broken.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.975
Well, not everyone.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.557
Well, what do you think?

I can't even believe
that you're taking
Wen's side.

I'm not taking
any sides.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.003
You were fuzzy about
what day it was.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.670
Because of the monotony
of one day blending
into the next.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.168
Oh, so spending
quality time with me
is monotonous.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.135
You know what
I really think?

10:40.306 --> 10:43.844
I think that
it's okay to be
a little off your game.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.347
I think it's okay to
ease back into things.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.596

let me take care of you.

something about

for the mission.

I ram my worth
down their throats.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.348
Once the doors are sealed,
no one comes or goes.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.265
So I suggest
you adapt and
overcome.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.227
Slim pickings in here.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.149
FARGO: Yeah, and now
they're getting slimmer
with you here.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.189
The resources are
meant for four people.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.907
We should treat him
as a stowaway.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.405
Restrain him,
and put him
on rations.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.153
Oh, you're welcome
to try.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.995
All right.
First test, candidates.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.090
You must each fold 100 cranes
and string them on a wire.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.086
(LAUGHING) Oh, seriously.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.554
No, no, no, no,
this is an actual
astronaut test.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.055
This is arts
and crafts.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.970
lt's empirical
origami.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.093
A chronological record
of our ability
to perform

12:10.230 --> 12:11.640
the kind of
intricate,
repetitive tasks

12:11.773 --> 12:13.263
that will be
necessary
on the mission.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.014
How do we handle
the monotony?

12:15.151 --> 12:17.358
Are the
last 10 cranes
as good as our first?

12:18.029 --> 12:19.894
Arts and crafts.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.027
No doubt the lack
of ab crunches
and dead lifts

12:24.160 --> 12:25.741
disappoints you,
Number One.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.076
Don't call me that.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.491
But this is about
strength of mind.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.407
As Holly so
acutely observed.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.078
(CLEARING THROAT)
Did I mention
you're being timed?

12:37.215 --> 12:39.001
(ALL CLAMORING)

12:39.550 --> 12:41.165
HOLLY: Excuse me.
Excuse me.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.798
ALLISON: Well,
it can't just be gone.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.261
ANDY: There's debris
at the bottom
of the shaft,

12:46.391 --> 12:48.256
just no sign
of the main
compartment.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.301
Shut down
all elevators
until further notice.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.063
There is nothing
wrong with me!

13:00.196 --> 13:03.313
Okay, so maybe
it was just
an accident.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.364
I mean, the
interstellar
something-or—other guy,

13:05.493 --> 13:07.654
he shattered glass
in Wen's office
this morning, so...

13:07.787 --> 13:09.948
VVeH,lguess
that's possible.

13:10.081 --> 13:13.289
You should look into it,
since clearly l'm incapable.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.671
Your atrial
septal defect is

13:19.799 --> 13:22.962
in a particularly
bad spot, Henry.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.217
Most doctors agree
it's untreatable.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.425
Fortunately for you,
I'm not most doctors.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.507
l have developed
a new surgical procedure

13:31.644 --> 13:32.884
that I believe could
repair your heart

13:33.021 --> 13:34.602
with very little
recovery time.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.767
Now, what do you say
we patch you up and
send you into space?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.060
Uh, I say,
"When can we
get started?"

13:39.193 --> 13:40.933
What's your
success rate?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.314
Oh, on people?

13:42.447 --> 13:46.110
Uh, sample size
is too small to
be significant.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.779
Um, it healed
a lot of pigs,
though.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.068
Truckloads of them.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.905
Henry,
we need to talk.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.499
Yeah... Mmm.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.826
Uh, yeah.
I guess we
need to talk.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.078
Yeah.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.172
DR. FUNG: Uh, yes,
I could have disintegrated
the elevator

14:03.301 --> 14:05.041
using the right
or wrong frequency.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.167
But I didn't.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.335
Really?

14:08.014 --> 14:10.130
'Cause we heard a
pretty nasty-sounding
sonic boom

14:10.266 --> 14:12.803
right before
the elevator
went bye-bye.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.969
You do realize,
l'm actualizing

14:16.105 --> 14:19.939
a real-time interplanetary
communications network.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.647
Well, that's a
lot of big words,
uh, Dr. Fung.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.192
But you're playing
loose and easy
with safety. So...

14:26.324 --> 14:29.236
Nothing I've done
could disintegrate
a tungsten elevator.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.280
I swear to you.
And frankly, I have to...

14:31.412 --> 14:32.913
(RUMBLING)

14:59.399 --> 15:01.560
You know,
I'll be needing
a new lab, ASAP.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.068
That's not my department.
Uh... Hey, guys?

15:03.194 --> 15:05.936
Another lab and a
chunk of the cafeteria
just collapsed.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.403
Andy, any ideas?

15:07.532 --> 15:09.818
Yup. The floor's
support beams.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.118
They don't seem
to be there.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.652
Right.
Uh, disintegrated
by a giant sound wave.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.157
Gosh, no.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.451
That would leave
a totally different
forensic signifier.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.417
Thank you. Totally
different forensic signifier.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.797
So, gone as in,
uh, taken, then?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.383
Hmm. Unlikely.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.219
Reinforced G.D. tungsten
is awfully tough
to cut through.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.050
Though there are
tiny serrations along
the remaining debris.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.265
Okay.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.886
Well, the missing elevator
was made of tungsten.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.307
Ooh!

15:43.109 --> 15:44.519
A pattern.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.900
Yeah, if
it was taken.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.644
Uh, what would
someone do with it?

15:48.781 --> 15:49.941
All kinds of
useful things.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.315
They could make support beams,
the Astraeus spacecraft.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.407
An elevator.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.152
Let's talk about
the second one.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.739
LARRY: Boring!

16:00.251 --> 16:01.912
Let's heat you up
just a bit.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.048
Oh, God, I love myjob.

16:15.391 --> 16:20.602
Okay, okay. l'll grant
that Dr. Timmons comes off
a touch overconfident.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.685
A touch?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.931
But he is one of the
top cardiac surgeons
in the world.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.104
And if your heart was in
danger, I'd be all for it.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.398
But your heart works
perfectly fine
here on earth.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.567
Grace, this was your idea.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.487
lt's experimental
heart surgery, Henry.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.951
It is too risky.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.410
It's my risk.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.411
Oh, is it now?

16:44.545 --> 16:45.751
Huh.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.458
(EXHALES)

16:56.182 --> 16:58.173
Bathroom's free.
Oh.

16:58.309 --> 17:00.265
But it doesn't work.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.353
So, fix it,
Number Four Asterisk.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.564
Hell, no. I got
cranes to fold.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.272
How chivalrous of you.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.063
I bet it's part
of the test.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.032
They mess with the
facilities to see
how we react.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.780
Luckily, I can
hold it a long time.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.704
My doctor says
I have the bladder
of a water buffalo.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.871
Holly, have you ever
heard the expression

17:26.003 --> 17:27.038
too much information?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.962
With Holly,
there's no such thing.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.711
Aw! Thanks, Isaac.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.965
Man, it's like
a sauna in here.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.259
There's gotta be a...

17:43.020 --> 17:45.807
Ah, here we go.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.936
Aw! Seriously?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.444
My bad.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.491
Please, why would
I steal tungsten?

18:00.121 --> 18:02.954
Well, Senator Wen
told you to finish
the spacecraft ASAP.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.915
Maybe you needed
more raw materials to
meet the new deadline?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.908
It's already been met.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.957
What?
The ship.
The hull's done.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.338
See for yourself.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.420
Oh.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.643
ANDY: Whoa.
Very impressive.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.309
DR. SANAGUSTIN:
Just wait until you see
the micro-polymer paint job.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.433
You said you're going
to have to push your guys
hard to finish it.

18:31.569 --> 18:32.558
Maybe I should
talk to them.

18:32.695 --> 18:36.028
Oh, well, you might
find that conversation
a bit one-sided.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.986
The ship was built by
a team of construction mites.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.149
Hmm.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.822
Mites, as in bugs?

18:42.163 --> 18:45.906
Bug-like robots
that are programed
to consume tungsten

18:46.042 --> 18:46.906
and fuse
the raw material

18:47.043 --> 18:49.455
layer by layer
using laser centering.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.665
Andy, you said
that there were, um,

18:51.797 --> 18:53.958
tiny serrations
in the lab floor?

18:55.009 --> 18:55.964
| see where
you're going
with that, boss.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.926
I would have to measure
the bite radius of the mite
to be sure.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.046
But it sounds
plausible.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.513
I don't think so.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.473
Yes, | crank them to 11
to speed things up,

19:04.602 --> 19:06.684
but that wouldn't
make them go around
eating elevators.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.188
They had more than
ample raw material

19:08.314 --> 19:09.554
to complete
the ship's hull.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.066
CARTER: Where are
the mites now?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.974
Well, when they
complete the task,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.943
they go into
storage automatically.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.108
Huh. They should be there.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.656
And you're going...
You're going to...

19:24.830 --> 19:26.206
Fill in the blank.
You're going to...

19:26.332 --> 19:27.822
Look, I designed
the spacecraft.

19:27.958 --> 19:28.868
I didn't program the mites.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.241
Why don't you talk
to the man who did?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.118
A bright kid, Zane Donovan.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.583
Fantastic.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.511
Can you stop doing that?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.848
Helps me concentrate.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.850
Well, if you didn't
bring enough
for everyone...

19:52.483 --> 19:54.599
For you, Miss 92, anything.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.484
How did you know
my score?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.983
On the written test?
Lucky guess.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.033
You hacked my test
and cheated for me,
didn't you?

20:04.745 --> 20:07.122
I'm sure
I have no clue
what you mean.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.455
VVeH,lguess
not all of us are
playing on a level field.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.494
Interesting.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.591
Could this get
any more frustrating?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.381
(POP SONG PLAYING OVER PA)

20:26.934 --> 20:28.925
LARRY: Enjoy
the tunes, Number Two.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.726
I gotta go number one.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.062
So do I.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.273
(SINGING) Car wash, yeah

20:38.487 --> 20:39.818
Senator Wen?

20:40.906 --> 20:41.895
Thank you.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.952
With all due respect,
I believe that I should
be reinstated.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.741
Allison.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.744
Your last MRI
still showed
slight variation

20:53.002 --> 20:54.788
from your
pre-incident state.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.162
Yes, but still within
the parameters of
normal brain activity.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.298
Why the rush?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.927
Because I'm fine. I've
had multiple brain scans.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.182
My motor skills
are perfectly fine.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.923
You didn't
answer my question.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.974
Why the rush?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.185
Then I don't understand.

21:15.024 --> 21:15.979
I think I do.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.517
To have your mind
taken over.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.942
The violation,
the loss of control.
If it were me,

21:24.074 --> 21:26.486
I'd want my normal life
back as soon as possible.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.447
I'd need it back.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.449
Yes, exactly.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.871
So what I need
to ask you is,

21:33.000 --> 21:37.460
are you absolutely sure
that you're 100%
back to normal?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.962
Or do you just
need to be?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.837
Boss, you seem
particularly
stressed today.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.304
Would you like
to talk about it?

21:49.433 --> 21:50.809
No, not...

21:53.062 --> 21:57.021
All right, um, I'm stressed
because Allison's mad at me.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.182
I'm stressed because
I'm wearing a tie
that's strangling me.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.058
And I'm stressed because
we can't find the
one guy at G.D.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.526
who can tell us
about a bunch
of insect bugs

22:02.655 --> 22:04.441
that are
running around
destroying everything...

22:04.573 --> 22:05.562
(GRUNTING)

22:06.283 --> 22:07.318
Look out.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.861
(GROANING)

22:09.662 --> 22:11.744
Who put a metal door
in the hallway?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.747
Actually, it's a hatch
for the Astraeus.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.740
And I'm guessing
they did.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.586
Andy, they're
not building a hatch.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.499
They're eating G.D.
and building a whole ship.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.474
Senator Wen?
We have a bug problem.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.764
I just heard about
the missing mites
from Dr. Sanagustin.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.978
Notjust missing.
Eaﬂng.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.814
Eating and
building ship walls.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.683
Now, we've evacuated
the areas with the
most damage.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.402
But it's only a matter of time
before whole sections
coHapse.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.945
Recommendations?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.406
I think we should
kill the mites.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.693
Actually, the

They're impervious
to heat, cold, gases,
electromagnetic pulses.

Fantastic.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.710

working on shutting
them off.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.205

I'm sorry, no.

If we had restrained
the stowaway
like I suggested,

23:31.201 --> 23:33.112
there would be plenty
of extras for everyone.

You can have
some of my paper, Holly.

through all of this.

that happen?

Sure.

But you have to
go down to the

have come back on.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.136
How could you
know that?

put me in here

is just the next step in
messing with our heads.

hear any of this.

supposed to go out.

should have restored it.

were like ants
at an Andy picnic.

Yeah, well, something
hit this mite,
that's for sure.

29:34.064 --> 29:34.974
I mean, it's
no wonder that they

29:35.107 --> 29:37.223
never got the order
to shut down.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.021
The signal transducers
were reduced to dust.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.898
Uh, a dusted
signal transducer
means...

29:43.031 --> 29:45.022
Well, ifthere's
no way to override
the initial mandate,

29:45.158 --> 29:46.568
then the mites continue

29:46.702 --> 29:49.159
consuming and
building indefinitely.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.071
I think I know
what happened.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.822
And I know where to
find our exterminator.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.082
Okay.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.915
All shored up,
for now.

attention span of toddlers.

every little distraction
that happens on Titan?

unshakeable fortitude

30:17.149 --> 30:18.810

That would be
a construction mite.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.203
Uh-oh, guys.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.960
If my mites have
eaten their way
clear down here,

30:41.089 --> 30:43.341
they would have done
some serious damage to
G.D. on the way down.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.083
Then Carter
will figure out
a way to help us.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.086
I highly doubt
Carter's top priority
is restoring our power.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.883
FARGO: And these chairs
won't hold much longer.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.177
So we have
to get ourselves out.

manual override
in this tin can?

sealed door.

already damaged

with his sound waves.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.402

out of commission?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.205
How long before
the iso-chamber
coHapses?

31:19.461 --> 31:21.201
At their accelerated
rate of consumption

31:21.797 --> 31:24.038
and the amount of tungsten
they've already consumed,

31:24.174 --> 31:26.005
I'd say in about
30 minutes.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.874
Okay, I can make it
happen in five, but...

31:28.178 --> 31:29.167
Go.
No, stop.

31:29.763 --> 31:32.004
Look, a pulse on that
wavelength intense enough

31:32.140 --> 31:33.300
to reach the mites
from a distance would

31:33.433 --> 31:35.719
scramble essential systems
all over G.D.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.764
That's the but
I was starting
to mention.

31:39.272 --> 31:43.641
Look, the mites
have all gathered on
the isolation chamber.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.063
A localized pulse could
obliterate them all

31:46.196 --> 31:47.527
if we could
get it down there.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.318
But there's no guarantee
that we can reach the
iso-chamber in time.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.609
The mites have turned
the entire sublevel
into a maze of ship walls.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.327
Yes, and the level was
hard enough to navigate
on a good day.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.163
But I can guide someone
using the thermal imaging.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.123
I'll be the bug bomber.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.493
WEN: No, Allison.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.958
You just said that it was
hard enough on a good day.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.297
You're feeling
that good?

32:08.009 --> 32:11.217
Yes, and no one knows
G.D. better than me.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.550

32:14.683 --> 32:18.096

I know.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.059
How's it coming?

32:28.363 --> 32:31.275
Why did I have to make
these things damn near
indestructible, huh?

32:31.450 --> 32:34.192
Because you don't
do things half-assed.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.073
Even when you're
being a complete ass.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.827
So, why'd you
tell me the truth?

32:42.335 --> 32:45.122
It was either come clean
about being a mole,
or die in here.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.543
Besides, I can't
break out on my own.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.876
You confessed
about my test score

32:52.095 --> 32:53.380
before anything
went wrong.

32:54.431 --> 32:59.642

I'm not always
a complete ass.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.304
We

33:08.236 --> 33:09.487
have power.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.316
Okay,
now remember.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.990
This is a one-time use
bug bomb with limited range.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.498
To annihilate
all the mites,
you're gonna have to

33:20.707 --> 33:23.949
get right up close
to the isolation chamber
before you push the button.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.462
The sonic blast should
take care of business.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.663
Should I cover my ears?

33:29.799 --> 33:31.835
Well, it couldn't hurt.

It's, like, eight inches.
We'll never make it.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.139
Oh, me, me.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.190
I can manage
eight inches,
no problem.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.602
It's gonna be
a bit tight.

34:33.738 --> 34:37.105
Oh, I have
extremely limberjoints.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.319

34:39.077 --> 34:40.066
Okay.

34:54.676 --> 34:55.665
Uh-oh.

34:55.927 --> 34:56.916
You're stuck.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.927
Is it too late to coat me
in something slippery?

35:00.140 --> 35:01.880
Not even remotely.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.058
Oh.
Can you at least
reach the override?

35:05.395 --> 35:06.430
Oh.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.472
Oh, oh, oh!

Jack, you can get over.
There's a good
two feet at the top.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.226
Then make a sharp right
on the other side.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.773

Okay, we need a plan.
We can do this.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.460
Holly, stay put.
I'm gonna need you
in a sec.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.588
I'm not going anywhere.

Zane, start chewing.
We're gonna need it sticky.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.093
Jo, fasten these wires
together at the ends

Half an inch
to your left, Jack.

Yeah, about that.
Um...

39:44.132 --> 39:46.999
Um, I may have been
a little overprotective.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.792
But it was nice.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.259
And then there was
a particularly traumatic

39:54.392 --> 39:55.632
fifth-grade
dodge ball incident,

39:55.768 --> 39:57.724
so teams have never
been my thing.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.603
But after seeing you
in the iso-chamber,

40:01.274 --> 40:03.606
your commitment
to the work and the group...

40:03.735 --> 40:06.147
Well, I do like
to lead by example.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.937
Oh, and you did, you did.
Uh, it was very manly.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.032
What I'm trying to say
is that, uh...

40:14.787 --> 40:16.402
You make me want
to be a team player.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.247
Manly, huh?

40:27.800 --> 40:28.926
Yeah.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.085

scream like a girl.

gets me, Henry?

ls you still think
like a bachelor.

I mean, I am
the last person to stand

40:46.903 --> 40:48.393

and your dreams.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.396
I'm just asking that we
weigh the risks together.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.236
You're right, it's not
just my risk, it's ours.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.906
And as much as
I want to go to space,

40:57.038 --> 40:59.575
I'm not willing to risk
my life with you to do it.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.038
You know, I'm not
going to go either.
No, no, mmm-mmm.

a full pardon for me.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.663
So I'll be eligible
for Astraeus.

Is that so?

if I really want to go.

be kidding me.

l threatened those guys
with triple tire drills

recommend you
to Wen, and...

Seriously, Jo,

42:53.821 --> 42:55.652
you don't even realize
what you've done for me.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.697
With a pardon,
I can go anywhere.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.860
From now on,
if! stay in Eureka,

43:03.206 --> 43:05.538
it won't be because
I have to be here.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.496
It'll be because
I want to be.
