<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

00:14.414 --> 00:18.217
- There she is again.
- Crazy hat's always here.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.187
What do you think
her deal is?

00:22.189 --> 00:24.957
Former movie star?
Olympic figure skater?

00:24.959 --> 00:26.692
Bum on a bench.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.195
But look at how
she looks at everyone.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.398
What goes on
in a head like hers?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.799
I guess we'll never know.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.235
Hey, crazy hat!
What goes on in your head?

00:37.404 --> 00:40.239
And a new adventure begins.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.975
You and you, c'mere!
I'll teach you about life.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.444
Can't.  Stranger.
You want me to sit on the bench,

00:45.446 --> 00:47.880
I'm gonna need three forms
of identification.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.749
Trust me.
I know who she is.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.984
She's all right.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.553
Okay, copper.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.589
Hey!  That's officer copper
to you.

00:59.492 --> 01:02.928
Mornin', evelyn.
Never gonna stop rainin', is it?

01:02.930 --> 01:05.697
That's okay, eugene.
These two little dollies

01:05.699 --> 01:09.001
Are about to give me one
of their designer ponchos.

01:09.003 --> 01:11.970
They're garbage bags, eugene.
But you have to put a hole
for your head.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.972
Ah, so you can breathe.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.542
So the garbageman
doesn't throw you out.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.410
Yep, that happened.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.979
- I was yelling,
but he didn't care.
- I rescued her from the truck.

01:22.015 --> 01:25.717
She chased me all the way
to 33rd street.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.519
Wow, now that is a friend.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.022
Me?  I don't chase nobody
for nothin'.

01:30.024 --> 01:32.291
What if I stole a banana?

01:32.293 --> 01:35.394
I'd be very
disappointed in you.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.830
Okay.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.665
I have observed

01:39.667 --> 01:41.366
You two are good friends.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.635
Don't miss a thing,
do you, crazy hat?

01:43.637 --> 01:46.839
No, I don't.
Now you're about to be
late for school,

01:46.841 --> 01:50.275
And I'm about to be
late for addressing
the united nations.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.311
Have a good day, dollies.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.047
Be good people,
learn all you can.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.717
How does that happen
to someone, maya?

01:58.719 --> 02:00.619
Do you think that could
ever happen to us?

02:02.422 --> 02:05.324
Well, at least nothing worse
than that could ever happen.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.594
Maya!

No!

- no!

- Riley?
- What's my thing?

03:14.495 --> 03:16.862
- What's your thing?
- What am I going to be, dad?

03:16.864 --> 03:20.032
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Riley, listen to me
very carefully.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.035
- Okay.
- In 1831, belgium declared

03:23.037 --> 03:25.037
Its independence
from the netherlands.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.873
What will people
be thinking of me

in a subway?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.911
What if nothing happens
for her, sir?

03:32.913 --> 03:36.014
Riley can't end up like that.
She's my meal ticket!

03:36.016 --> 03:39.051
What the--?  I just saw
you girls at breakfast!

03:41.721 --> 03:43.822
( speaks dutch )

03:45.458 --> 03:47.993
Calm down, farkle.
You're speaking in dutch again.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.031
( speaks spanish )

03:53.033 --> 03:54.766
Cory:
<i>No no no.</i>

03:54.768 --> 03:56.602
You slapped yourself
way too hard.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.570
You went all the way
to spanish.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.709
My education should not be based
on your daughter's moods.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.411
Neither should mine,
but it is!

04:07.847 --> 04:10.949
Guys, a daughter
asks her father,

04:10.951 --> 04:14.987
This question will resonate
in the hearts of all parents

04:14.989 --> 04:16.989
From the moment it's asked

04:16.991 --> 04:19.825
Until the day their child feels
comfortable in the world.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.895
Pretty soon you're all
going to join the work force.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.064
<i>What's your thing?</i>

04:26.066 --> 04:28.567
What do you aspire to?

04:28.569 --> 04:31.069
How will you affect people?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.572
That's the only history
that matters.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.940
Thank you, daddy.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.708
( whimpers )
thank you, daddy.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.111
All right, guys,
tell you what.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.047
Let's split the class
into two separate businesses

04:42.049 --> 04:44.016
And see how you do
for yourselves.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.518
We'll see if anyone's got
anything to worry about, okay?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.654
( mimics cartoon character)
excellent.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.055
What will
our companies be?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.090
Doesn't matter.
Uh...

04:52.092 --> 04:54.059
Muffins, okay?

04:54.061 --> 04:57.896
You two are going to be
"riley and farkle's muffins."

04:57.898 --> 05:00.832
- That'll be
your thing for the week.
- I already got my thing.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.001
Riley's gonna be a success
and I'm gonna sponge off her

05:03.003 --> 05:04.469
Until she gets sick of me.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.040
- I will never get sick of you.
- I am set for life!

05:08.042 --> 05:09.975
All right, let's get out there
and make some money--

05:09.977 --> 05:13.045
Cash, cabbage,
cheddah-cheeeze!

05:13.047 --> 05:14.946
Those are your values, farkle?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.049
What else should
a company value
but profits?

05:17.051 --> 05:18.984
If I had a company,
I'd treat my employees well

05:18.986 --> 05:20.986
And make sure we did right
by our customers.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.989
You are everything that's wrong
with this country.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.893
Then you do have
a company, lucas.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.262
"hart and friar muffins."

05:30.264 --> 05:33.865
So these two
competing companies

05:33.867 --> 05:36.268
Will hire the rest
of you guys as employees.

05:36.270 --> 05:39.237
Everyone else in school
will be your customers.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.873
- Let's see what happens.
- Here's what happens,

05:41.875 --> 05:44.009
- We crush you.
- We will be bajillionaires,

05:44.011 --> 05:46.578
And you will eat your words
using plastic cutlery.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.748
You're cute when
you're menacing.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.985
I don't know
what to do now.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.054
- I know.
-  <i>( bell ringing )</i>

06:03.563 --> 06:05.764
- What?
- Belgium.  Let's go.

- Get out.
- Okay.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.644
What would I be
paying you for?

06:19.646 --> 06:21.613
I don't know.
You pay riley.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.616
I give riley an allowance
because she does chores.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.152
- What do you do?
- You're lookin' at it.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.922
Okay, here is
a nickel.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.925
Is this a joke?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.827
What do you think
you're worth, auggie?

06:35.829 --> 06:39.297
I think I'm worth
$3.49 plus tax.

06:39.299 --> 06:42.768
Well, that sounds like
the price of something.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.104
And you know that
somebody's birthday
is coming up, don't you?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.807
Maybe I do.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.345
Then you are about
200 times cuter
than I thought.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.947
Wow, 10 bucks!

06:55.949 --> 06:57.682
I'm gonna go roll
around in this!

06:59.118 --> 07:01.353
- I like chocolate!
- Me too!

07:04.991 --> 07:07.025

- Last muffin from this batch.
- ( crowd groans )

07:13.167 --> 07:15.967
Why are their muffins
so white?

07:15.969 --> 07:18.670
- One dollar.
- Hold on.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.139
- I don't think so.
- What are you doing, farkle?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.974
It's the law of supply
and demand, riley.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.810
We supply, they demand.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.778
Let's find out what
our last muffin is
worth to them.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.346
- Dollar and a quarter!
- $1.50.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.183
Hey!  What's so great
about their muffins?

07:31.185 --> 07:33.218
We've got plenty
of muffins right here.

07:34.153 --> 07:35.253
- $2.00.
- $2.50!

07:35.255 --> 07:37.055
I'll give you
my brother!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.326
All right,
progress reports.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.162
What's up in make-believe
corporate america?

07:44.164 --> 07:49.000
We started with 100 muffins,
made each with all-natural
and organic ingredients.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.102
And you selected
these ingredients because?

07:51.104 --> 07:54.005
Because that's the right
and responsible thing to do.

07:54.007 --> 07:57.776
- You really believe that?
- I dunno!  You spend a day
with this guy.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.013
So far we've sold 14 muffins
at a dollar each.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.115
Okay, how much
do they cost you?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.151
- They didn't
cost us anything to make.
- How's that possible?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.954
My mother bought them
for us.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.122
She wanted us
to sell healthy food.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.426
How's that
workin' out for us
so far, huckleberry?

08:14.428 --> 08:16.795
As soon
as we sell them all,
I'll pay her back.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.363
I stand by
our product, sir.

08:18.365 --> 08:21.166
So do I.
They're everywhere.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.103
How are
your profits, friar?

08:25.105 --> 08:27.138
Let me teach my class,
farkle, okay?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.441
I decide what to say
and when I'm gonna say it,

08:29.443 --> 08:32.744
And I decide who to call on
and what I'm gonna ask them!

08:32.746 --> 08:36.047
- How were my profits, friar?
- Yes!

08:36.049 --> 08:38.917
Well, I have those
right here, sir.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.153
None.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.155
- I'm sorry, what?
- None.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.925
And it's not right, sir.
Our muffins are good for you.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.094
- I'm sorry, what?
- None!

08:49.096 --> 08:50.695
We can't even
give them away.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.169
All right, let's talk about
a real make-believe company.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.239
Farkle's muffins!

09:01.241 --> 09:03.108
Riley and farkle's
muffins.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.943
Yeah, keep tellin'
yourself that.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.012
Unlike our competitors,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.447
Our profits are
through the roof,
and so are our employees.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.021
Why are they like that?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.956
- They ate the product, sir.
- Riley?

09:17.958 --> 09:20.025
Everybody seems to like
our muffins, dad.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.461
Oh, my sweet innocent child.

09:23.463 --> 09:27.132
- Can't you see why?
- Because they're
filled with love.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.001
I don't think that's what
they're filled with, riley.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.472
Yeah.
Why do they come out
so white, farkle?

09:34.474 --> 09:37.175
Because they're 100% carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.077
Uh, explain that
to the non-scientists, farkle.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.848
Sugar!
They're all sugar!
Just one big sugar cube!

09:43.850 --> 09:45.183
What?

09:45.185 --> 09:49.421
Ours are oatmeal, honey
and locally-harvested berries.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.823
Farkle, you said
all-natural.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.825
- Sugar!
- You said organic.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.828
- Sugar!
- You said delicious.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
Sugar!

09:58.832 --> 10:01.099
Farkle,
we're a business.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.168
Businesses do not just
mislead their customers

10:03.170 --> 10:05.136
- To make a little bit
of money!
- Ha-aaaa!

10:07.073 --> 10:10.809
We're done for, farkle.
These muffins are
pure evil.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.044
Are you gonna eat that because
if you're not gonna eat that I
would eat that right now

10:13.046 --> 10:15.180
Is what I would do is
I would eat that right now
is what I would do.

10:16.949 --> 10:18.850
You know how
you succeed, riley?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.085
You give the people
what they want.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.087
That's why
we're a success...

10:25.291 --> 10:27.459
And they're not.

10:29.496 --> 10:33.164
I had to listen to lucas
and his mother talk about

10:33.166 --> 10:35.934
( twangy accent )
"good eatin'"
and "wholesome livin'"

10:35.936 --> 10:39.170
And "the natural cornucopia
of the earth's bounty"...

10:39.172 --> 10:44.042
- Have you ever
even heard me talk?
- Huh-hur-rrrr!

10:44.044 --> 10:46.144
Wow.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.246
...While these two
just poured sugar
into a muffin cup.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.315
- It isn't fair!
- What isn't fair?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.817
That I'm not
on their team!

10:52.819 --> 10:54.919
Maya, what we did
isn't okay.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.088
But I didn't know
and I'm not going down
for this.  I'll talk.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.557
To who?  To everyone
who loves our muffins?

10:59.559 --> 11:03.061
Enjoy the taste
of success, riley.
It's sweet.

11:04.230 --> 11:07.098
Not to me.
I have a very bitter
taste in my mouth.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.234
You must've eaten
one of ours.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.569
Maya, you played fair.
We didn't.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.405
We have no integrity.
You do.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.474
And what does that get them?
We can buy and sell
their business.

11:16.476 --> 11:20.111
In fact, I like
the sound of that.
Yeah!

11:21.180 --> 11:23.381
I propose a merger between
riley and farkle's muffins

11:23.383 --> 11:26.084
- And hart and friar muffins.
- Why the merger, farkle?

11:26.086 --> 11:28.186
We both have what we
each need, mr. Matthews.

11:28.188 --> 11:31.189
We have profits.
They have integrity.
I'm buyin' it!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.591
My integrity
is not for sale.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.527
- Mine is.
- Maya!

11:35.529 --> 11:38.129
We owe your mother
a hundred bucks.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.031
Put 'er there, partner!

11:40.033 --> 11:42.867
Our new company
will be called

11:42.869 --> 11:44.936
"farkle."

11:44.938 --> 11:47.038
Your names are no longer
part of the company.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.506
Why not?

11:48.508 --> 11:51.242
"what's the first thing
that happens after
a merger, daddy?"

11:51.244 --> 11:54.412
What's the first thing
that happens after
a merger, daddy?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.214
Downsizing.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.384
When two companies
come together, employees
become vulnerable.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.354
- Don't tell him!
- Uh, riley, I think
he already knows.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.993
Lucas, fire half
of the company.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.063
- Start with riley and maya.
- Why do I have to do that?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.566
Because you're
all full of that texas
"gee willikers" hooey.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.536
You charm people.
So you'll be the face
of the company

12:18.538 --> 12:20.939
And I'll be
the behind-the-scenes
hermit genius.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.543
- Mr. Matthews?
- How do you argue with that?

12:25.545 --> 12:28.980
Always liked you, matthews.
You got moxie.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.150
Thanks, chief!

12:35.554 --> 12:37.689
- Riley?
- Yeah?

12:39.125 --> 12:40.291
You're fired.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.394
<i>Fine.</i>
<i>( footsteps )</i>

12:45.131 --> 12:47.465
Hey, if she goes, I go.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.538
Friendship and loyalty
are for the weak.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.673
Let everyone know
I'll cook another batch.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.208
And raise the price
up to $3.00.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.410
- They'll never go for it.
- Oh...

12:59.412 --> 13:01.212
I think they're hooked.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.186
Mommy, doing your
lawyer stuff?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.221
Yeah, I'm just
going over a case.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.723
- What's it about?
- Oh!

13:11.725 --> 13:14.025
Thank you for taking
an interest, auggie!

13:14.027 --> 13:16.060
One company
under-reported their
earnings for the fiscal--

13:16.062 --> 13:18.663
Please make it stop!

13:18.665 --> 13:20.498
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

13:20.500 --> 13:22.233
Thank you!

13:22.235 --> 13:25.069
- Who's that?
- That's what I spent
my allowance on.

13:25.071 --> 13:29.541
Oh, well, it's not quite
my birthday yet, but okay!

13:29.543 --> 13:32.510
And it's a delivery?
You had something delivered?

13:32.512 --> 13:36.281
How did you do that?
Are you a genius and we
don't know it?

13:37.283 --> 13:39.717
Hi, auggie.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.554
Thanks for the stuff!

13:42.556 --> 13:45.123
Okay, no.
You're not a genius.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.125
You're just a boy
under the spell of--

13:47.127 --> 13:48.459
♪ look at me

13:48.461 --> 13:53.264
♪ I'm ava mor-gen-stern!
Yeah! ♪

13:55.301 --> 13:57.535
I just like you
more and more.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.239
Auggie bought
all of this for me.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.608
What did he buy for you?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.744
Auggie doesn't have to buy
my love with costume jewelry.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.314
( demonic voice )
you said this was real!

14:09.316 --> 14:12.717
Okay okay!  You know
what we're gonna do?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.385
You know what we're
gonna do right now?

14:14.387 --> 14:17.121
We are going to play
hide and seek!
Yes, we are!

14:17.123 --> 14:19.557
Okay, auggie, you can go
in the other room and count.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.060
- Isn't the hider supposed--
- we're gonna play a new way.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.562
- I'm pretty sure
it's supposed--
- new way!

14:24.564 --> 14:26.631
Women!

14:29.201 --> 14:32.503
- I'm onto you.
- This is not about us, topanga.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.176
- What did you say?
- Auggie needs a raise
in his allowance.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.480
I'll tell you what,
you little sugar cube.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.285
I am gonna show you
the best place to hide

14:47.287 --> 14:49.621
- Where he will
never find you!
- Where?

14:49.623 --> 14:52.557
Both: Whee!

14:52.559 --> 14:54.525
- Your house.
- But--

14:56.095 --> 14:58.496
Ready or not
here I come!

15:01.166 --> 15:05.136
( whispering )
mommy, where's ava?
Am I getting warm?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.105
No.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.706
- Auggie?
- Yes?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.209
You bought ava
some shiny stuff, huh?

15:11.211 --> 15:14.112
Because I love her.
Where is she?

15:14.114 --> 15:17.215
Listen, auggie,
what's shiny isn't
always good.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.184
But it sure was expensive.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.153
- You don't have
any money left?
- Nope.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.554
Who's gonna love me now?

15:25.224 --> 15:29.227
Listen, people don't always
know what's good for them.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.529
Please know what's
good for you, auggie.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.799
This is pretty good.

15:36.201 --> 15:39.437
You threw her out again,
didn't you?

15:49.181 --> 15:51.649
I gave my whole life
to that company.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.585
What happened?
I can't even keep
a fake job.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.554
Oh no, all of my fears
are realized.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.457
- I'm going to end up here!
- Don't go crazy.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.128
Now go crazy.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.564
Now you got fired...
( mumbles gibberish )

16:08.500 --> 16:11.402
Ah, the box of shame.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.338
What happened?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.906
Class project.
Fake business.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.342
- Got fired.
- Not so terrible.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.277
I've been fired myself
once or twice.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.245
Yeah, but not
from fake businesses.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.581
I think you could
call 'em that.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.416
Now I come down here
and watch people

16:25.418 --> 16:28.386
Coming and going,
giving their lives
to fake businesses.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.189
Welp, gotta go!
Big meeting!

16:32.624 --> 16:34.492
With squirrels.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.498
Yeah.  Thanks.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.838
It's just us.
It's just us on the bench.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.240
No jobs, no future,
no dollar,

16:49.242 --> 16:52.944
Because I gave it to her.
What am I gonna do about
my mid-afternoon snack?

16:52.946 --> 16:55.880
I got pizza crust
and a shoe.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.582
- What size?
- 10!

16:57.584 --> 17:00.451
What a terrible day.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.825
<i>♪ I'm singing "go-o-o"</i>

17:07.827 --> 17:10.328
<i>♪ oh oh oh oh.</i>

17:12.264 --> 17:13.431
( chuckles )

17:13.433 --> 17:15.967
Well, look who's still here.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.803
My dollies.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.639
Been looking at
the people, huh?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.941
Hey, hat, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.878
- How'd your meeting go?
- Oh, the usual.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.981
Yelled at everybody.
Y'know, rahr rahr rah!
Rahr rahr rah!

17:29.983 --> 17:32.483
Had 'em all running around
scared of me.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.286
- Sounds like fun.
- It's more fun

17:35.288 --> 17:37.622
When I come down here
from my big, tall building.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.825
- Oh, your building?
- It was named after me.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.828
The crazy hat building?

17:43.830 --> 17:47.365
I sit here
lookin' at all the people
because it turns out,

17:47.367 --> 17:50.968
Other people are the key
to your own happiness.
I watch 'em enough

17:50.970 --> 17:53.337
And I start thinkin' about
what I can do for them.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.541
- What you can do for them?
- Mm-hmm.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.677
Now you've been lookin'
at all these people,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.312
Now what do you see?

18:05.784 --> 18:07.618
I see a bunch
of wet people

18:07.620 --> 18:09.887
Who could probably use
some real umbrellas.

18:09.889 --> 18:13.291
Yeah, not the no-good kind
some farkle sells
on the street

18:13.293 --> 18:15.927
Just to make some "cash,
cabbage, cheddah-cheese."

18:15.929 --> 18:19.564
Huh.
You saw all that just
by lookin' a little.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.499
What's a farkle?

18:24.903 --> 18:27.271
Did you know that people
won't protect themselves
from the storm,

18:27.273 --> 18:28.906
But they'll make sure
their morning doughnut
stays dry?

18:28.908 --> 18:31.476
Interesting observation.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.544
Now what are you gonna tell
your class about it?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.880
Nothing.
Not going back.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.282
- Tired of being humiliated.
- Tough.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.952
You know what?
We're gonna go back.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.820
Crazy hat goes
into buildings

18:42.822 --> 18:45.356
And screams at people
and you're not humiliated,
right?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.358
- Rahr!
- Rrow!

18:48.293 --> 18:49.794
Okay, rahr.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.596
That was terrible!

18:58.971 --> 19:00.738
It's been raining
for six days.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.541
Here's what's real:
People are wet and cold
out there.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.977
They need something
to keep them safe
from the storm,

19:05.979 --> 19:07.712
And we know how
to give it to them.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.814
What if every single
subway stop in new york city

19:09.816 --> 19:14.519
The matthews and hart
umbrella foundation.
It's non-profit.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.687
What?!

19:16.689 --> 19:18.456
When you come
into the subway station

19:18.458 --> 19:20.324
You leave an umbrella
in the stand--

19:20.326 --> 19:22.894
And when you leave
the next station, there'll
be one waiting for you.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.029
The matthews and hart
umbrella foundation.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.631
We got you covered.

19:27.566 --> 19:28.933
There's no money
in umbrellas.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.369
- No, only people.
- My company makes a profit.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.938
Yeah, but at what cost?
Look at your customers.

19:33.940 --> 19:38.509
How could something
that tastes so good
make me feel so bad?

19:39.978 --> 19:42.079
What goes up must
come down, farkle.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.091
At least I was up.
What do you have
besides an idea?

19:54.093 --> 19:57.061
They've got an investor!

19:57.063 --> 19:58.863
- Oh no.
- She followed us.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.999
Evelyn rand.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.101
You know crazy hat?

20:04.103 --> 20:07.371
I know she's
the chairman of the board
of rand industries.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.974
<i>You guys</i>
<i>walk by her building</i>
<i>on the way to school.</i>

20:09.976 --> 20:13.044
- She really has a building?
- With her name on it.

20:13.046 --> 20:17.148
You'll usually find me
on the top floor of my building

20:17.150 --> 20:19.050
Going,
"rahr rahr rah!"

20:20.652 --> 20:24.088
You two dollies want
to know how I got my name
on the building?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.058
I do!

20:27.060 --> 20:30.161
By knowing a good idea
when I hear one.

20:30.163 --> 20:34.165
So I've made out a check
to "the two dollies."

20:34.167 --> 20:36.667
- You can do that?
- I can do whatever I want.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.103
Now what I want you to do

20:39.105 --> 20:40.705
Is go get some umbrellas,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.573
Go get 'em in some
subway stations.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.976
You start.
The people will do the rest.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.612
I believe in them.
I've watched them.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.081
Now which one
is the farkle?

20:52.651 --> 20:54.852
Mm-hmm.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.692
Stop it!

21:02.894 --> 21:07.832
Now this is
$1.00, farkle.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.535
Somebody came by it
by doing hard work.

21:11.537 --> 21:15.072
Not by pumping people up
with something you knew
would let them down.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.643
Don't keep the dollar.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.445
It won't fix you
if you keep it.  Pass it on.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.782
That's what changes you, farkle.
Take it from me.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.451
( speaks dutch )

21:30.789 --> 21:33.057
And, you two,
don't worry so much
about your future.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.092
- Really?
- Really, yes.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.962
You two dollies,
you're going to be just fine.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.032
Mm-hmm, now here,
here's your first umbrella.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.108
Nice, nice work, dad.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.211
You really think that
you can make a difference
in these kids' lives?

21:54.213 --> 21:56.914
Yeah, I do.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.517
I'm their teacher.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.653
Good for you.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.559
Riley, if it's
at all possible,

22:08.561 --> 22:10.127
I'd like to help out
with your company.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.630
Aww.
You're as sweet
as sugar.
