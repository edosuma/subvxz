WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:05.922
I kissed Walter.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.551
-Oh, my god!

00:09.634 --> 00:11.511
Tell me everything.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.681
Okay. I was feeling down,
so I did what my dad always says to do

00:14.764 --> 00:15.932
and I went to the ocean.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.977
And Walter was just there. Like he knew.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.311
-No.
-Yes.

00:20.895 --> 00:24.733
And we talked, and then he leaned in,
and he was chewing sweet mint gum.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.317
Or maybe it was winter mint.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.320
It's hard to tell with all that xylitol,
sorbitol and aspartame, and then...

00:29.404 --> 00:32.365
Wow, all that, and with a guy
who can afford to buy gum.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.626
What's up, dudes?

00:48.673 --> 00:50.050
Dudes?

00:51.426 --> 00:54.929
Honestly, even "ma'am"
would have been better.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.142
I have an announcement.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.769
I just got my first chest hair.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.520
I'm a man now.

01:06.024 --> 01:09.069
-There?
-No, that's a Pop-Tart crumb.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.323
There it is, I think.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200
Yes! No. Yes!

01:15.283 --> 01:16.242
Aw.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.285
Hm.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.787
Chest hair and make-outs

01:18.870 --> 01:20.580
-in the same 24-hour period.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.208
Can't believe you guys are still talking
about Lahela and Walter.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.502
It's, like, so what? I've kissed 45 girls.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.504
-Forty-five?
-Forty-five.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.422
-Oh.
-You sound impressed.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.216
Well, I'm not "not impressed".

01:31.299 --> 01:33.093
I mean, this is an island.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.471
"Dudes"?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.307
What is happening?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.643
You just need to just chill out
and read his vibe.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.561
I'm a busy doctor.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.939
I don't have time to read his vibe.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.024
You know what?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.276
I'm just gonna swim out there right now
and ask him.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.402
No!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.988
You might not know this
because you finished high school at seven,

01:54.072 --> 01:55.907
but you can't just ask a teen boy
what he's thinking.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.242
Why not?

01:57.867 --> 02:01.079
It's literally never been done before.
Who knows what would happen.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.332
My gut tells me
I should just go talk to him.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.417
My gut tells me to hide
under your brother's bed,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.586
pop out in the middle of the night
and confess my love.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.840
But I don't, because your mom told me
not to do it anymore.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.591
So this is it.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.928
I just have to live my life not knowing.

02:17.762 --> 02:22.183
You know, you could post a video on TikTok
and see what he comments.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.728
So inexact, so basic.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.523
Whatever Walter replies
will show you how he feels.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.742
I've never wanted to be a towel before.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.411
I think I just got pregnant.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.496
I'm gonna make that video.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.252
What would you like the card to say?

03:31.336 --> 03:34.047
I don't know. "Happy Anniversary"?

03:34.839 --> 03:35.882
Or...

03:37.258 --> 03:41.721
"My love, every day,
I marvel that I have the honor

03:41.804 --> 03:44.599
of being on this planet
at the same time as you.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.934
I love you."

03:46.768 --> 03:48.353
How's that?

03:48.937 --> 03:49.854
Sure.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.150
Can you imagine not knowing
what to say to your partner?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.902
One time I didn't know what to say,

03:55.985 --> 04:00.073
but I picked up my ukulele
and ultimately conveyed it with my hips.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.534
Now that I'm a man,
I've been taking notes on romance.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.080
If you want notes on romance,
it's kind of my specialty.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.164
Back in the day,

04:08.248 --> 04:11.251
I used to go out to a club
and get onto the dance floor.

04:11.793 --> 04:15.088
Forget it.
The ladies love a man who can dance.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.216
-But then what happened?
-What do you mean, "what happened"?

04:18.299 --> 04:19.884
Well, you don't have moves now.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.012
You say, "Here we go,"
whenever you get off the couch.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.264
I have moves.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.975
Ask Mom. She thinks I'm romantic.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.103
To her,
I'm still Benny <i>Ke Ali'i oke Aloha.</i>

04:31.896 --> 04:33.523
The King of Romance!

04:34.816 --> 04:37.026
How do you say "the King of Chest Hair"?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.737
<i>Keil... li.</i>

04:41.197 --> 04:43.950
<i>Keil... li... hi.</i>

04:47.745 --> 04:50.331
We just picked him up from his hotel,
paralyzed from the waist down.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.000
-Pool accident?
-Not this time.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.126
I can't move my legs.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.003
A few minutes ago,
I could still move my legs.

04:55.086 --> 04:57.255
-Hi, what's your name?
-Caleb.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.841
-Can you tell me what happened today?
-Nothing.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.259
What?

05:01.342 --> 05:02.844
I came here to hike Stairway to Heaven.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.929
I was walking to the hotel elevator
to pick up some gear,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.307
and then my legs just stopped working.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.143
-Have you fallen recently?
-No, I'm telling you, normal day.

05:10.226 --> 05:13.313
Okay, this nurse is gonna check
your vitals and we'll be right back.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.190
Let's get him in for an MRI immediately.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.109
-MRI machine's out.
-What?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.903
A claustrophobic guy kicked it last night,
and it's still being serviced.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.822
Okay, well, in the meantime,

05:22.905 --> 05:25.950
I need an initial workup of LP,
CBC, and electrolytes.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.329
Let's get his copper, vitamin B12,
and vitamin E levels, too.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.706
Doctor. Hey, doctor.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.625
I'm gonna be able to walk again, right?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.754
I'm gonna do everything I can for you.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.442
Sorry, I'm late.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.819
My mom has a date tonight,
so we were waxing her legs.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.238
She must really like him,
'cause we did both sides.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.577
Oh, my god. Walter finally commented.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.204
What is it? Show mama.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.374
A caterpillar?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.127
What does that mean?
Does Walter like me or not?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.713
Listen, translating emojis
is my life's work.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.298
That, and perfecting my moves.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.676
But a caterpillar emoji?

06:29.472 --> 06:30.306
No clue.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.019
Hey, Mom, you're not gonna believe
what happened.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.312
My chest hair thickened.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.897
Because you drew on it with a Sharpie.

06:37.980 --> 06:42.151
And Dad told us that people
used to call him "The King of Romance".

06:42.235 --> 06:44.445
Our dad! This guy!

06:44.529 --> 06:46.447
Benny Kamealoha!

06:46.531 --> 06:49.367
Well... he was.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.077
Was?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.830
You should have seen your dad
back in our 20s.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.457
Oh, we would go out to the club

06:56.541 --> 07:00.044
and I would have to chase
all the girls away in my tube top saying,

07:00.128 --> 07:03.923
"Hey, like, get back, shoo, scram.
I will follow you home

07:04.006 --> 07:05.174
and I will hurt you."

07:05.258 --> 07:06.968
I just realized,

07:07.051 --> 07:09.387
you guys have never
seen him do "the song".

07:10.304 --> 07:13.391
Okay, you know that Nelly song,
<i>Hot in Herre</i>?

07:13.474 --> 07:14.809
Come on, Benny.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.478
Show the boys what you're working with.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.024
-Ooh!

07:22.108 --> 07:24.735
-Ooh.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.571
-Ooh!

07:27.155 --> 07:30.491
Oh, there it is. Yes.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.287
-Go, Dad, go.
-I knew I got it from somewhere.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.332
Man, your dad was the smoothest.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.001
Once again, I'm hearing "was".

07:40.084 --> 07:42.837
Always knew
what to say and what to do.

07:42.920 --> 07:47.633
He was just so thoughtful and so suave.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.927
Not loving the amount
of past tense I'm hearing.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.686
How are you feeling today, Caleb?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.272
I still can't walk.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.361
I just want to ask you
a few more questions.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.114
We've been over your medical history,

08:10.198 --> 08:12.450
but we're at the point
where it would be helpful

08:12.533 --> 08:15.536
to ask your family members
about their medical histories.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.455
Any history of autoimmune diseases,

08:17.538 --> 08:21.042
like lupus or myasthenia gravis,
rheumatoid arthritis,

08:21.125 --> 08:23.711
-or multiple sclerosis...
-I just don't understand.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.882
Yesterday, I was preparing
for the hike of a lifetime,

08:27.965 --> 08:29.842
and today, I can't even walk.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.930
I might be leaving this hospital
in a wheelchair.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.681
And I don't know why.

08:36.474 --> 08:40.228
Caleb, hopefully,
we will have answers soon.

08:42.897 --> 08:48.444
Now, I'm so sorry, but I just have
a few more questions.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.866
This case is driving me crazy.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.660
The tests keep coming back clean.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.621
I mean, I feel so far from a diagnosis.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.957
Girl, if anyone can figure it out,
it's you.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.875
Your brain is basically a computer.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.961
I'm just a fast reader.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.463
I mean, what is life?

09:07.838 --> 09:10.591
One day, you're walking
and then suddenly, you can't.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.885
One day you're making out
with someone on the beach

09:12.969 --> 09:15.596
and then, they're sending you
the world's worst emoji.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.014
I mean, what the crap?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.850
Uh, can we circle back
to the making out on the beach part?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.060
Please circle back.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.145
Hey, any update on the case?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
I heard you up all night working on it.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.275
Yeah, I mean, I have to crack this.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.903
Well, don't forget, the best way
to get a definitive answer

09:30.987 --> 09:33.197
is to go back to one
of the building blocks of medicine,

09:33.281 --> 09:34.740
the scientific method.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.909
You can apply it to almost any question.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.084
Exactly.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.212
The scientific method.

09:50.339 --> 09:53.342
His progressive weakness
and lack of lower extremity reflexes

09:53.426 --> 09:55.303
makes me think
it's Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.846
But since I'm not a neurologist,

09:56.929 --> 09:59.098
I really appreciate you
looking into this case.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.142
I agree with the full neuro work-up.

10:01.225 --> 10:04.687
The CSF protein isn't high like
you'd expect with Guillain-Barre,

10:04.770 --> 10:05.980
but that doesn't rule it out.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.774
I'll perform nerve conduction
studies right now.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.610
And report back to you,
and let you know what I find.

10:10.693 --> 10:15.072
Thank you, Dr. Tukushi. He's in 327.
Again, I really appreciate it.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.282
Oh, my pleasure.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.660
Oh, excuse me,
I gotta run to my ten o'clock.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.786
Okay.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.415
Thank you for joining me today

10:24.498 --> 10:28.711
as I present my findings
on applying the scientific method

10:28.794 --> 10:30.504
to the query, "Does Walter like me?"

10:34.550 --> 10:36.302
Hey, can you rent this room
out for the hour?

10:36.385 --> 10:38.512
My improv team is always looking
for a place to practice.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.473
No, this is a hospital.

10:40.556 --> 10:44.769
So I did a deep dive into Walter's socials
and his use of the caterpillar emoji...

10:45.436 --> 10:49.148
Positive, although he did use it
on his mom's Instagram once.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.734
In your defense, she is hot.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.403
My next data point, body language analysis

10:54.487 --> 10:56.906
from candid shots my mom took
before the dance.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.950
-Oh.
-His leaning stance suggests interest

11:00.034 --> 11:01.077
based on a study published

11:01.160 --> 11:03.287
in the Journal of Nonverbal Communication.

11:03.371 --> 11:07.291
Great. So for the non-doctors in the room,
he likes you.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.417
I hope so.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.546
But all my evidence is circumstantial.
I wish I had some hard data, his DNA.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.131
Then I could run some tests,

11:14.215 --> 11:16.550
vis a vis, the science of attraction

11:16.634 --> 11:18.052
-and maybe I could...

11:21.430 --> 11:22.556
Steph?

11:23.683 --> 11:26.143
Yeah, we go straight up there, right?
Then we come...

11:26.227 --> 11:27.353
What the...

11:27.436 --> 11:30.147
I don't wanna know
how you got this, but thank you.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.484
Oh girl, we haven't even scratched
the surface on my creep ability.

11:35.444 --> 11:38.072
This proves that Walter and I
have dissimilar DNA,

11:38.155 --> 11:39.782
which was a key factor in a study where...

11:39.865 --> 11:40.700
I'm good.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.079
Okay, well, my point is,
the science supports my hypothesis.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.664
Walter likes me.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.165
Now, I just need to prove it

11:48.249 --> 11:50.835
by replicating the findings
and getting Walter to kiss me again.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.670
Well, slap on some ChapStick
and go get it.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.672
I have to set up the perfect date.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.341
I'm thinking the beach.
That's where we had our first kiss.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.885
Ooh, string lights, hurricane candles,

11:59.969 --> 12:02.513
beachy pillows, soft blankets,
maybe some live music.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.515
-It'll be amazing.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.767
-For science.
-For science.

12:07.351 --> 12:11.439
-Science! Science! Science!
-Science! Science! Science!

12:11.522 --> 12:12.732
-DR.- Hey.
-- Science! Science!

12:12.815 --> 12:14.734
Can you guys get out of here?
It's my Xbox time.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.777
DR.Go, go, go.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.904
Hey.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.825
I thought we'd have
a romantic night tonight,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.577
just you and me, baby.

12:25.619 --> 12:29.540
This candle is not the only thing
that got waxed today.

12:33.127 --> 12:38.632
First course of the night,
smooth jazz and some filet mignon.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.967
-Oh, thanks babe.
-Mm-mm.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.182
Mmm.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.349
It's good.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.434
So how was work?

12:48.517 --> 12:51.395
Mmm. Mmm.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.690
Any update on the Gail-Jim-Gary
love triangle?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.777
I still can't believe
she's dating two security guards.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.986
Mmm.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.491
Wow, honey, you're missing
a very romantic date.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.828
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.248
I mean, be in the moment,
take in the sky, take in the moon.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.959
I have a crazy job and three kids.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.544
Catch up with you later, moon.

13:17.797 --> 13:22.384
Shoot. I gotta hop on a Zoom
with a gastroenterologist in Hamburg.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.596
<i>Hallo!</i>

13:40.152 --> 13:42.488
Lookin' good, girl.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.366
All right, I'm gonna prove
that hypothesis, once and for all.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.244
-These lippies are getting some action.
-And you're all set at the beach.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.829
You got the blankets, the lighting.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.164
And don't worry,
I dragged away that dead shark.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.792
I can't do anything
about the smell, though.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.544
Now, go get him!

13:56.627 --> 13:57.837
Okay!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.426
So, how was school today?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.638
Kind of a mixed bag.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.225
We had a pop quiz in Spanish class,
which was <i>no bueno,</i>

14:11.308 --> 14:14.436
but then, we had a fire drill,
so we got to go outside.

14:15.145 --> 14:19.108
You know, I’ve never really asked,
what's it like being a 16-year-old doctor?

14:19.191 --> 14:22.403
Well, I love being a physician.

14:22.486 --> 14:26.031
But, I mean, I can't really compare
my life to anything else.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.075
This is the only 16 I know.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.494
You know, I get that.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.289
People always ask if it's weird
to be raised by my mom and six aunties,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.082
but it's all I've ever known.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.460
Plus, now, I've memorized
the washing directions for Spanx, so...

14:40.379 --> 14:42.840
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you this.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.175
What did the caterpillar emoji
on my TikTok mean?

14:45.843 --> 14:47.094
Caterpillar?

14:47.177 --> 14:49.179
Transformation challenge? Get it?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.764
Ooh.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.602
Whoa.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.812
You like it?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.732
Yeah.

15:00.524 --> 15:01.525
Wait, who's that?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.194
Just some casual live music.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.536
Wow, this is all...

15:12.620 --> 15:14.580
Awesome, right?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.877
It's a perfect date.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.174
So...

15:35.935 --> 15:36.852
Sorry, Lahela,

15:36.936 --> 15:40.314
I actually forgot I have to write a paper
on King Kamehameha.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.690
Oh.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.944
You know, my dad's totally obsessed
with King Kamehameha.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.278
I could help you.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.156
That's okay,
but, um, thanks for the fun hangs.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.242
Yeah, totally.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.162
So then, this is goodbye.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.843
At least he didn't call you "dude".

16:24.191 --> 16:26.527
Hey, did I hear someone singing out there?

16:26.860 --> 16:27.945
Pretty dope.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.406
Oh, glad I spent hundreds of dollars

16:30.489 --> 16:33.909
so that my brother could have
a romantic evening with his surfboard.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.870
Hey, this is the only time
we've had together all day.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.455
Beach was blanket to blanket
with tourists.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.500
I could barely get in the water.
Looking out, all I could see was this.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.546
-"Look at me. I'm from Ohio!"

16:45.629 --> 16:47.381
Why do they all do it like that?

16:47.464 --> 16:48.882
No clue.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.969
Even the most beginner surfers
from Hawaii sit on their boards,

16:52.052 --> 16:53.137
waiting for their waves.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.973
Guess it's 'cause we grew up
watching people do it the right way.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.017
Wait.

16:58.767 --> 16:59.810
Do that again.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.937
-The dumb tourist thing?
-Yeah.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.275
Cheesecake Factory. Go Packers!

17:52.613 --> 17:54.406
-Did you surf?
-What?

17:54.490 --> 17:56.075
Before you were paralyzed, did you surf?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.868
Yeah, the day before,
but it was just my first lesson.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.537
-I didn't wipe out or anything...
-It's surfer's myelopathy.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.749
It's an extremely rare condition,
only about 50 cases worldwide.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.876
And most of them happened
right here in Hawaii.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.253
When the back's hyperextended,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.380
a blood vessel leading to the spine
becomes kinked,

18:10.464 --> 18:12.091
depriving the spinal cord of oxygen.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.635
Hold up. Only 50 cases worldwide?

18:14.718 --> 18:15.969
Wow, Lahela. I'm...

18:16.053 --> 18:18.639
That's a tough diagnosis.
How did you figure it out?

18:18.722 --> 18:21.100
I just read all 578 patient reports

18:21.183 --> 18:23.560
of spinal cord injuries
ever treated in this hospital.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.145
-You just read all of that?
-What?

18:25.229 --> 18:28.816
Yeah. And found this guy in 2008,
and then 2003, and more.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.110
Surfing lessons mentioned
in almost all of them.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.862
Here I was, thinking Caleb
might have Guillain-Barre,

18:33.946 --> 18:36.115
turns out it was a spinal stroke.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.326
Excuse me. I want a spinal angio
with intra-arterial tPA,

18:39.409 --> 18:40.744
start methylprednisolone

18:40.828 --> 18:42.246
-and up his IV fluids.
-Yes, doctor.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.332
I'm gonna induce hypertension
to improve blood flow to his spine.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.333
Really?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.377
-What does that mean?

18:48.460 --> 18:51.213
It's like if your phone battery
was really low,

18:51.296 --> 18:53.465
and you found a really fast charger.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.885
I'm gonna do that,
with oxygen and your spine.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.028
No. No, no, no, no, no.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.738
No, no, no, no.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.950
What are you doing?

19:20.033 --> 19:23.203
I lost my manhood. My chest hair is gone.
Help me find it.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.415
Can't. Dad actually inspired me
to sign up for a hip-hop dance class.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.043
Okay. If I were a chest hair,
where would I be?

19:30.127 --> 19:31.461
Not on your chest.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.630
No, no, no.

19:33.714 --> 19:34.840
No, no, no, no, no.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.763
Good morning, Caleb.
How has treatment been going?

19:43.765 --> 19:45.058
Check this out.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.693
-Oh, my god.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.361
You're walking!

19:56.820 --> 19:59.239
Look at you! Go, Caleb!

19:59.323 --> 20:01.158
.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.618
Thank you, Dr. Kamealoha.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.578
Oh, you're welcome. Really.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.288
It's so good to see you up and about.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.041
And I'm hopeful
you will make a full recovery.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.670
So when physical therapy clears you,
you can hike, climb Stairway to Heaven,

20:13.754 --> 20:15.547
maybe even take a second surf lesson.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.382
Oh, one was enough.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.552
Hey, I'm so happy to be on my feet again,
I may just keep walking for a bit.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.764
Might as well see Hawaii out of these
hospital windows while I'm here, right?

20:23.847 --> 20:25.098
Just take it slow.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.600
Thanks again, Doctor.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.860
Lahela, you cracked it.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.697
This is amazing.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.076
We're getting a shave ice to celebrate.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.370
I feel like
I'm doing really great as a doctor,

20:46.453 --> 20:49.289
but sucking everywhere else.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.166
Oh, I know that feeling.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.337
I just wish relationships
were more like science.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.298
Oh, yes, that's my kid.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.800
Science is clean.

20:59.883 --> 21:00.926
-It's easy.
-Linear.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.844
Like nucleotides linked into chains.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.096
Yes.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.848
I don't get it. I thought Walter liked me.

21:07.641 --> 21:11.103
But I set up
this whole romantic night and...

21:12.312 --> 21:13.814
he didn't even care.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.607
Well, maybe you should just talk to him.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.775
That's what I said.

21:16.858 --> 21:21.238
Plus, you may be half me,
but you're also half your dad,

21:21.321 --> 21:24.199
who's the most romantic guy I've ever met.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.120
And I'm gonna make sure he knows that.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.705
Ew.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.249
No one wants to hear about mom-dad love.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.210
Yeah, I know right. Wait.

21:50.434 --> 21:55.397
Come on, give me some
of that Benny <i>Ke Ali'i oke Aloha.</i>

21:55.897 --> 21:57.024
Nope. Can't.

21:57.107 --> 22:01.653
I gotta prep for a flower Zoom
with a dude in Austria.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.493
I'm sorry.

22:10.329 --> 22:14.458
But, babe, next time you're on a date
with me, just let me know.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.625
Okay?

22:17.085 --> 22:18.462
I love you.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.547
I know.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.133
I just don't want to be
in one of those marriages

22:23.216 --> 22:27.012
where some handsome, strapping stranger
has to write my anniversary card

22:27.095 --> 22:28.764
because I don't know
how to show you I care.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.850
You don't have to worry about that.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.728
I feel very loved, Benny.

22:34.811 --> 22:37.147
Not just then, but now too.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.276
-Good.
-Good.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.028
Because you're actually
on a date right now.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.281
-Oh, am I?

22:53.497 --> 22:56.958
Oh, oh, oh. You're so smooth.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.127
-That's sweet.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.253
I like that move.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.380
You do.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.359
I wanted to ask you this days ago,

23:22.442 --> 23:26.238
but I didn't because I wanted to be cool,
but I'm not cool, so here we go.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.240
Um, hi.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.450
Hi.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.371
Do you like me or not?

23:34.454 --> 23:37.582
What? Yes, of course, I do.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.793
So then what was last night about?

23:40.377 --> 23:41.461
Honestly, Lahela?

23:42.212 --> 23:45.465
That whole scene was a lot, you know?

23:45.549 --> 23:47.968
The lights, and the big guy
on the ukulele...

23:49.469 --> 23:51.388
It all just felt so out of my league.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.349
I mean, you're out of my league.

23:55.392 --> 23:56.643
I was nervous.

23:57.477 --> 24:00.272
Wait. You were nervous?

24:00.355 --> 24:03.608
Um, you don't remember my weird high five?

24:03.692 --> 24:06.570
'Cause it's all I've been thinking about
since it happened.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.489
No, that's gonna be lodged in my brain
for a very long time.

24:21.751 --> 24:27.549
So, it turns out,
love is life's big mystery.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.760
It's not a science, there's no math to it.

24:31.386 --> 24:35.682
You have to show up, make mistakes,
live through the awkward moments.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.851
Still thinking about that high five.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.605
But it's worth it.

24:42.898 --> 24:48.069
Love is this sloppy, weird,
confusing thing.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.073
And I'm so ready to try and figure it out.
