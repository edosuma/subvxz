00:09.109 --> 00:12.442
<i> For 1000 years, the worlds divide. </i>

00:12.512 --> 00:15.845
<i>Creatures of magic</i>
<i>in Halloweentown reside. </i>

00:15.915 --> 00:18.941
<i>Witches and goblins</i>
<i>forced to take flight,</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:21.852
<i>driven away by evil Iron Knights. </i>

00:21.921 --> 00:25.254
<i>But the era is over. </i>
<i>The worlds reunite. </i>

00:25.325 --> 00:28.920
<i>The portal is open,</i>
<i>but not without a fight. </i>

00:33.099 --> 00:36.728
Now, what are you planning on
saying to the council?

00:36.803 --> 00:39.829
- What am I gonna say to them?
- Grandma, no. Don't get her started.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.636
Oh, well. I sure know
what I'd like to say to them.

00:42.809 --> 00:46.074
But you know what?
All I should have to say is...

00:46.146 --> 00:47.773
"You're welcome. "

00:47.847 --> 00:52.079
I mean. I only opened the portal
to save the entire world.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.710
thank me very much!

00:53.787 --> 00:56.620
I should be getting a parade.

00:56.689 --> 01:00.090
but no, no, no.
I get a summons instead.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.390
- You got her started.
- Any idea how to turn her off?

01:02.462 --> 01:04.453
Oh, and you know why
they don't like my idea

01:04.531 --> 01:06.499
of letting the kids from
Halloweentown go to school here?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.194
- Fear and ignorance.
- Fear and ignorance!

01:09.269 --> 01:11.760
That's why. Honestly.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.966
I mean, you try to bring
a little harmony to the universe.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.736
and all you get is...

01:18.344 --> 01:20.778
- Is it time?
- Oh, no, dear. Trust me.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.439
You'll know when it's time.

01:22.515 --> 01:23.948
Huh? What are you talk...

01:24.017 --> 01:26.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:26.953 --> 01:28.580
It's time.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.924
Uh, hi, your greatness...

01:36.996 --> 01:41.092
sses-sses-sses-sses-sses.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.328
Um... Whew.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.871
If I could just say
a few words in my defense...

01:45.939 --> 01:47.804
Please. You have nothing to defend.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.172
We've asked you here to thank you.

01:50.243 --> 01:52.939
- Really?
- Of course. You saved Halloweentown.

01:53.012 --> 01:57.244
- I think it's the least we can do.
- Oh.

01:57.317 --> 02:01.151
Oh, it was nothing.
You're welcome.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.210
Hm?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.984
I don't suppose
there's a parade involved.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.687
Now, about your proposal to send
a dozen Halloweentown students

02:08.761 --> 02:11.662
to high school in the human world...

02:11.731 --> 02:17.397
I say that if the portal's open.
we might as well use it, right?

02:17.470 --> 02:21.634
Now. Council President Dalloway.
I really must put several of my feet down.

02:21.708 --> 02:25.508
You and this council are determined to
leave us defenseless.

02:25.578 --> 02:28.274
The idea of sending children
into the human world...

02:28.348 --> 02:32.079
They'll have me.
And my mother and my grandmother.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.848
They'll have the entire
Cromwell clan protecting them.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.049
I doubt that even you
are a match for the knights.

02:38.124 --> 02:42.527
Knights. You mean, like, round table.
shields, lances, metal suits knights?

02:42.595 --> 02:44.256
Yes, the Knights of the Iron Dagger.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.891
Their mission in life
was to destroy all things magical.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.594
OK, OK.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.263
You people really have to
get out a little more.

02:52.338 --> 02:57.776
See, this is why we need this program -
to show you that the world is different now.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.280
I mean, people have changed.
People are more tolerant now.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.248
I find that highly unlikely.

03:04.317 --> 03:08.879
In fact. I'd bet all the Cromwell magic
that humans have changed.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.082
We can all live in harmony.
We can all coexist.

03:11.157 --> 03:12.124
- She said it!
- Yes!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.023
You all heard it. She said it!

03:14.093 --> 03:18.086
Marnie, if you feel that strongly
to bet the Cromwell magic.

03:18.164 --> 03:23.227
then we have no choice
but to accept your proposal.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.740
You have until midnight on Halloween.

03:28.975 --> 03:32.138
Uh, midnight on Halloween?
Wait.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.875
Now, what's going on?
Wait, wait! What did I say?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.451
- You bet our magic?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:42.522 --> 03:46.652
- I thought it was just a figure of speech.
- This is all your fault.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.093
- What? How is this my fault?
- If Marnie had been properly trained.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.290
she wouldn't have ever said
anything like that.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.163
If Marnie had been raised
the way that I wanted her to be raised.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.864
she wouldn't have been sucked through
a portal and put on trial in the first place.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.236
OK, OK.

04:01.307 --> 04:05.038
Look, let's just cancel the program.

04:05.111 --> 04:08.376
I mean, nothing can go wrong
if nobody comes to live with us.

04:08.448 --> 04:12.009
Oh, and I was so looking forward
to sharing my room with a werewolf.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.519
No. This is too important.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.988
We have to show people that they
have nothing to be afraid of.

04:18.057 --> 04:21.117
Besides, we have nothing to worry about.
There aren't any knights.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.286
Well, of course not.

04:22.362 --> 04:25.695
It's just a story parents in Halloweentown
tell their kids to scare them.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.596
It's like... the bogeyman.

04:27.667 --> 04:32.366
Oh. He's back in town.
He's been asking about you.

04:32.438 --> 04:35.464
For the 10.000th time.
Mother, no.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.874
- There really is a bogeyman?
- And apparently, he has a thing for Mom.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.311
- One date!
- But you're sure there aren't any knights?

04:41.381 --> 04:45.181
Yes. We're absolutely sure
there aren't any knights.

04:58.865 --> 05:04.030
Grasshopper Flakes? Who eats
honey-flavored Grasshopper Flakes?

05:04.103 --> 05:07.630
Gremlins. Apparently, it's the only thing
they will eat for breakfast.

05:07.707 --> 05:10.801
I think his name is Bobby, guys.

05:10.877 --> 05:12.435
Extra fresh.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.675
And where is your grandmother?
Sophie, let's go!

05:15.748 --> 05:20.617
I'd really rather that we weren't late
on our first day of school. Oy.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.655
Soph!

05:22.722 --> 05:26.453
Yeah. I'm not screwing up
my perfect attendance record

05:26.526 --> 05:29.495
just because you want to bring a little
peace and harmony to the universe.

05:29.562 --> 05:32.588
Some things are more important
than your perfect attendance record.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.895
like reuniting the worlds, for example.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.936
Why does reuniting the worlds
have to involve me sharing a bathroom

05:38.004 --> 05:40.632
with an ogre and a gremlin named Bobby?

05:40.707 --> 05:45.406
If I can get this spell right, none of us
will have to share any bathrooms.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.915
- That doesn't look like a level one spell.
- You know I'm almost at level two.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.678
Yeah, and that means
you're still at level one.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.846
Would you just trust me, OK?
I know what I'm doing.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.351
Whoa.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.094
- Marnie!
- Sorry.

06:09.635 --> 06:10.795
Ohh!

06:11.871 --> 06:16.535
OK. I think the construction spells
are still a little advanced for you.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.406
Let's see.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.742
Told ya.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.141
See?

06:33.593 --> 06:34.890
- Not bad.
- Beautiful.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.657
You'd think I'd be used to
this kind of stuff by now.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.719
Ugh. Let's go.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.195
Mom.
Grandma's on the witch's glass.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.930
Grandma, where are you?

06:45.004 --> 06:48.098
School starts in 20 minutes.
and you promised you wouldn't be late.

06:48.174 --> 06:51.007
And we're on our way.
I'm just getting everybody loaded up.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.840
No. Chester.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.743
You can't take your armadillo with you.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.272
- We'll just meet you at school, dear.
- Wait. Grandma, wait.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.244
See? No problem.
She's gonna meet us at school.

07:02.321 --> 07:05.484
What is she thinking?
She can't come to school dressed like that.

07:05.558 --> 07:06.616
Oh. I wouldn't worry.

07:06.692 --> 07:10.423
If she brings the flying school bus, people
won't even notice what she's wearing.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.624
Flying school bus?
She wouldn't.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.690
Oh, my gosh. We'd better go.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.329
Come on. Let's go, everybody.
Quick, Sophie, come on.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.667
I don't see anything.

07:24.744 --> 07:28.305
I don't suppose you know a
total-eclipse-of-the-sun spell?

07:28.381 --> 07:29.973
Afraid not.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.416
We're gonna need something to keep
people from noticing a 40-foot orange bus

07:33.486 --> 07:34.783
falling out of the sky.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.989
Yoo-hoo!

07:39.926 --> 07:42.895
- Grandma?
- Yes, yes, yes.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.862
It's me, it's me, it's me.

07:44.931 --> 07:47.229
Oh, my. Don't I look stylish?

07:47.300 --> 07:50.463
Mother. I am so impressed.

07:50.536 --> 07:53.664
Yeah. I mean. I didn't
even know you could drive.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.468
Oh, well. I can't.

07:55.541 --> 07:59.978
Oh. I asked two leprechauns
that I know to help work the pedals for me.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.209
They're right in here.
Thanks, guys! Thanks!

08:05.218 --> 08:07.186
It's a step in the right direction.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.016
- So sorry. Cassie.
- A little help.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.283
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, here, dear.
Let me help you.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.190
Oh, your backpack.
All right.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.751
Hi. Um. I'm Cassie.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.026
Are any of you human?
I've never met a human before.

08:20.099 --> 08:24.399
My guidebook says it's important to make
direct eye contact and not to show fear.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.869
Ha.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.633
Hi. I'm Marnie.

08:27.707 --> 08:31.939
And that would be lesson number one
on how not to greet humans.

08:32.010 --> 08:36.505
See, people around here automatically
assume that everyone they meet is human.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.642
Oh. Well, that's good to know.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.653
This is Cassie.
She's a neighbor of mine.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.053
Where are the other kids?
They're expecting...

08:44.123 --> 08:47.058
- Ow! Quit shoving!
- Come on out. Pete.

08:47.126 --> 08:51.586
Just put your backpack on.
Oh. Natalie. You're so cute.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.962
Oh, hi. Sweet girl.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.059
Here we are, now.
Just checkin' up. Here we go.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.502
Prettiest girl.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.632
Oh, big ones. Oh, my.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.573
Ohh. Chester.

09:04.644 --> 09:09.946
Ethan? Ethan Dalloway!
Now, come on.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.280
Chester's armadillo
ate a hole in my sweater.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.649
Oh. Chester.
I thought I told...

09:14.720 --> 09:18.588
Never mind, never mind.
Oh, everybody...

09:18.658 --> 09:23.254
this is Marnie.
and she'll be your student adviser

09:23.329 --> 09:25.194
- while you're in this world.
- Hi.

09:25.264 --> 09:28.256
And remember, if anybody
asks where you're from.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.928
you-you-you-you-you...
Oh.

09:31.003 --> 09:33.631
- Where are we from again?
- Canada.

09:33.706 --> 09:37.836
- You're all from Canada.
- Better write that down.

09:37.910 --> 09:42.574
OK, well, hi, and welcome. We don't
really have a lot of time for introductions.

09:42.648 --> 09:47.017
but I wanna take a moment to stress how
important it is that you try and blend in.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.348
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.083
OK. Come on, guys.
Let's go.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.455
- Bye.
- See you later. Good luck.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.586
Guys. I have your
school schedules here. Cassie?

09:56.662 --> 10:00.928
Well, if you'll excuse me.
I've got to go see a man about a job.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.768
Mom.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.670
Mother!

10:12.745 --> 10:14.713
Mother! Mother!

10:22.588 --> 10:25.716
- Go help your sister.
- Yeah.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.281
Knock, knock.

10:28.527 --> 10:31.087
Oh. Mrs. Cromwell.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.963
I've got to be honest with you.
Mrs. Cromwell.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.559
When you first contacted me this summer

10:37.637 --> 10:41.471
about enrolling nearly a dozen
foreign exchange students.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.907
well. I said to myself.
"There's just no way. "

10:44.977 --> 10:49.471
But here you are, paperwork done.
It's like magic.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.949
Oh, well. Remarkably similar.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.580
You just have to know
how to work the system. Mr. Flanagan.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.214
Oh, call me Phil.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.190
Mm, Aggie.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.557
What in the...?

11:02.628 --> 11:04.528
Get down! Stop that.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.260
I mean, your bird probably
wants to get down from there.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.733
Ah.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.203
You know, the students and I
are all looking forward

11:13.272 --> 11:17.766
to soaking up your culture
and taking part in your customs.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.607
You're all from Canada, right?

11:21.914 --> 11:23.711
Oh. Certainly are.

11:24.850 --> 11:29.685
I should probably get to class.
I don't want to keep my students waiting.

11:29.755 --> 11:33.486
If you have any problems.
any problems at all, just...

11:33.559 --> 11:35.618
- My bird! It's gone!
- Oh.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.159
- I hope you find your bird.
- Oh, thank you. Where...?

11:43.235 --> 11:46.466
Honestly.
I can't take you anywhere.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.732
Peepers?

11:48.808 --> 11:52.300
I'll let you know when Aggie's
found a place for us to meet.

11:52.378 --> 11:56.974
But in the meantime, if you have any
problems, just find me or Dylan, OK?

11:57.049 --> 12:00.018
I'm sorry, but Dylan is jumping
off this welcome wagon.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.714
AP Calculus starts in two minutes.

12:02.788 --> 12:06.724
I have AP Calculus, too.
All my classes are AP.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.317
- Geek.
- I know. He's always been kind of a...

12:10.529 --> 12:13.327
- Oh. You mean her.
- AP Art?

12:13.399 --> 12:16.163
Wow, some things really are universal.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.500
Um, OK. Then Dylan.
why don't you show Natalie

12:19.572 --> 12:22.268
where those
with dazzling intellects congregate?

12:22.341 --> 12:25.902
And the rest of you, follow me.
Come on.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.446
Hey, you've got to keep up.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.482
And lose the tail.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.017
What are you.
some power-mad hall monitor?

12:33.085 --> 12:37.488
I saw your ta... Uh, your shirt hanging.
I'm sorry.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.622
- I'm Cody. It's my first day.
- Hi. I'm Marnie.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.722
- Can I join your little tour group?
- No.

12:46.799 --> 12:51.668
It's-it's not a tour group.
It's my senior project.

12:51.737 --> 12:55.036
I'm helping a group of exchange students
find their way.

12:55.107 --> 12:58.770
- So I'll see you around, then?
- Yeah.

12:58.844 --> 13:02.837
I'm sure.
It's not a very big school, so...

13:02.915 --> 13:03.973
Right.

13:12.057 --> 13:15.220
So, let's open our books
to chapter one.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.525
What's she talkin' about?
Has she ever taught in her life?

13:18.597 --> 13:24.229
Mr. Miller?
If I could have your attention.

13:24.303 --> 13:29.468
Ohh. And I had so hoped
we could all be friends.

13:29.542 --> 13:33.137
Uh. I must warn you.
I have quite a little temper.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.182
So, chapter one.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.082
- Ah.
- Sorry I'm late.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.320
Oh.

13:50.830 --> 13:55.358
Hi. See?
I told you it was a small school.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.800
So, now we're going
to start our experiment.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.031
Let's get our goggles on.
Mm-hm.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.376
If we mix together the sulfur

14:05.444 --> 14:07.708
with the iron ore.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.216
it should bring a puff of smoke.

14:15.721 --> 14:18.189
Grandma!

14:18.257 --> 14:21.522
- Wait a second.
- What are you...?

14:21.594 --> 14:24.222
I must've gotten a little help
from the magic.

14:24.296 --> 14:28.756
- You know, it's not quite an exact science.
- Yes, it is. It is a science.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.962
That's why they call it Science 101.
You're supposed to be here

14:32.037 --> 14:36.565
- so this kind of thing doesn't happen.
- What's a green puff of smoke, anyway?

14:36.642 --> 14:40.908
I mean, he's a parrot.
So much more exciting.

14:43.115 --> 14:46.107
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll be more careful.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.916
I forgot this.
I found us a perfect place to meet.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.356
Thank you. Now, would you be careful?
Watch that thing.

14:58.931 --> 15:02.867
She kind of fancies herself
an amateur magician.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.132
Let me know if you're
having a birthday party.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.270
So, no other parrots?

15:09.341 --> 15:12.572
Well. I see you've all managed your smoke.

15:12.645 --> 15:18.015
Now, who can tell me why these elements
reacted the way they did -

15:18.083 --> 15:21.177
why you got smoke and not a parrot?

15:42.308 --> 15:43.935
There's...

15:51.050 --> 15:57.114
Marnie, you of all people should know
that things aren't always what they seem.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.556
Hm. This is way better
than a teachers' lounge.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.220
Can I please take this off now?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.820
Of course, dear.
You're perfectly safe in here.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.026
Oh, and if anyone else
wants to unzip, it's OK.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.329
Oh, it's about time.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.393
- Unzip?
- Oh, finally!

16:35.260 --> 16:38.559
Oh, no. Things are definitely
not what they seem.

16:38.630 --> 16:42.464
How much longer do I have to
wear this stupid human suit?

16:42.534 --> 16:47.733
You guys have to remember that
to most humans, you don't exist.

16:47.806 --> 16:51.537
You're make-believe. But hopefully.
over time, we can change all that.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.945
What is that?

17:05.023 --> 17:10.223
Oh, don't worry. It's probably just the pipes.
My magic hasn't set yet.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.093
Oh. Oh, that's it.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.325
I'm already starting to make new friends.

17:17.403 --> 17:20.839
These two cheerleaders
walked past me and said...

17:20.906 --> 17:23.704
"What are you looking at, freak?"

17:23.776 --> 17:29.078
Isn't that sweet? I mean, they actually
thought I was a freak. It was so great.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.810
Oh, and when they pass out mice
in biology.

17:31.884 --> 17:36.651
you're apparently
not supposed to eat 'em. But...

17:36.722 --> 17:38.485
I had three.

17:40.459 --> 17:44.327
Everyone keeps saying.
"Hey, what's up?" What's up where?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.421
- Yeah. I heard that, too.
- OK, it's your turn.

17:46.498 --> 17:50.559
OK. Chester. It's your move.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.301
I wish you could've been there.
Today was, like, the greatest day

17:57.376 --> 18:01.938
of my whole life.
Everything went so perfectly.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.211
- I really think this is gonna work.
- Was there ever any doubt?

18:05.284 --> 18:11.189
You had an idea, you followed it through.
I am so proud of you.

18:11.256 --> 18:15.522
I just hope that someday I won't feel like
I'm leading separate lives.

18:15.594 --> 18:21.294
- You know, that I'm two different people.
- Both of them equally annoying.

18:21.366 --> 18:26.099
Oh. Do you have any unicorn milk?
It helps my digestion.

18:26.171 --> 18:30.608
I think there's some in the back
of the fridge. Oh. I'll help you.

18:30.676 --> 18:34.578
Oh, and I didn't even tell you the best part.
I met a boy.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.342
He's new. And I think he likes me.

18:37.416 --> 18:42.080
Smart. Snag him before he has
the chance to meet anyone else.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.549
Marnie! Ahh... Wah...

18:45.624 --> 18:47.615
Uh...

18:49.695 --> 18:52.960
Uh, OK.
I probably deserved that.

18:53.031 --> 18:57.365
Hello? A little help?
Mildly afraid of heights.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.136
Ohh. Nonfat.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.572
Everyone's so health-conscious.

19:03.642 --> 19:08.341
If you had any idea how hard it is to milk
a unicorn in the first place, you...

19:09.815 --> 19:12.113
- What's wrong. Mom?
- What...?

19:12.184 --> 19:13.173
Heh.

19:13.252 --> 19:16.085
I had set it to vibrate.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.057
Now, let's see who's calling
at this late hour.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.056
<i>Aggie, how are you?</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:29.392
- Edgar. I'm fine.
- <i>And your brilliant granddaughter?</i>

19:29.468 --> 19:32.062
Oh. Hi. Mr. Dalloway.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.469
The first day was amazing.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.100
Ethan and the kids are already
settling in to human life.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.442
<i>Well. I'm not worried about my son. </i>
<i>You know, he's such a little go-getter. </i>

19:41.513 --> 19:43.606
<i>I'm thrilled to know</i>
<i>everything's going so well. </i>

19:43.682 --> 19:45.673
Yep. We won't let you down.

19:45.751 --> 19:49.778
<i>It's not me I'm worried about, dear. </i>
<i>It's you and your magic. </i>

19:49.855 --> 19:52.255
<i>Have there been any signs of danger?</i>

19:52.324 --> 19:54.519
- Oh, no, no. None whatsoever.
- Mm-mm.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.460
<i>Good. Well, just remember. </i>

19:57.529 --> 20:00.259
<i>the hopes of all of Halloweentown</i>
<i>are on you. </i>

20:07.573 --> 20:09.871
What's the matter, dear?

20:09.942 --> 20:12.934
I never knew the weight of the world
could be so heavy.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.878
Don't worry.
We're gonna help you carry it.

20:15.948 --> 20:19.281
- What did he mean by "danger"?
- Was he talking about the knights?

20:19.351 --> 20:24.482
Uh, yes, but you have nothing to worry
about because there aren't any knights.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.615
- How do we know they're really gone?
- Yeah.

20:26.692 --> 20:31.459
It's been over a thousand years.
I mean, we're pretty sure they don't exist.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.225
You mean, like we don't exist?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.691
You know what?
I can be OK with this.

20:37.769 --> 20:41.432
You just watch me.
I'll stay up here all night.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.475
Well. I didn't exactly mean that.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.002
Are you OK?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.844
Oh. I'm fine, for someone
who slept on the ceiling.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.009
I said I was sorry.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.985
Come on, guys. Keep up.

20:55.053 --> 20:59.149
Uh, you know, you really don't need
to show us where our classes are.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.159
Well, maybe not.
but everybody is counting on me.

21:02.227 --> 21:07.756
and I want to make sure that
absolutely nothing goes wrong, OK.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.562
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.967
Uh, OK. Go on ahead, guys.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.631
You don't need me to show you
where your classrooms are.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.436
Didn't she just say...?

21:17.509 --> 21:22.606
- Um, so how's it going?
- Not bad. Uh...

21:22.681 --> 21:26.549
I waited around for you yesterday
after school, but you kind of disappeared.

21:26.618 --> 21:31.521
Oh. I was... I must've been
at a meeting or something.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.524
You waited for me?

21:33.592 --> 21:35.685
Yeah. Uh...

21:35.761 --> 21:39.527
I know you're really busy with
your exchange program and all, but...

21:39.598 --> 21:41.964
I was wondering if...

21:42.034 --> 21:45.936
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

21:46.004 --> 21:48.973
So I was wondering if...

21:49.041 --> 21:50.975
sometime...

21:51.043 --> 21:53.637
Fine! I...

21:53.712 --> 21:56.681
Would you excuse me for just a s...?
I have to go.

21:56.748 --> 22:00.309
Ah, mid-sentence. Sure.
Later, then.

22:00.385 --> 22:04.048
So I was wondering if you'd like
to go out with me sometime.

22:04.122 --> 22:08.024
Yeah, that was worth three hours
in front of the bathroom mirror.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.021
What is the matter with you?

22:13.098 --> 22:17.125
Did you not see the giggling?
The twisting of the hair?

22:17.202 --> 22:21.263
Can't a girl flirt for two s...?

22:21.340 --> 22:25.174
- What is that?
- It's an iron dagger.

22:25.243 --> 22:29.509
The knights' calling card.
They know we're here.

22:29.581 --> 22:32.243
They? Who's they?

22:32.317 --> 22:35.377
They don't exist.
I don't understand.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.319
Neither do I.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.290
It's perplexing.
I mean, why the warning?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.055
The knights weren't known for playing fair.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.858
It could just be somebody
from Halloweentown, right.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.230
who's trying to scare us?
Someone who wants the portal closed?

22:49.301 --> 22:52.964
I don't know.
But that's what we're going to find out.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.596
And if there really are knights?

22:54.673 --> 22:57.164
We have a lot more to lose
than just our magic.

23:05.650 --> 23:09.746
What do you know about
that boy you were talking to?

23:09.821 --> 23:14.884
I don't know that much about him.
I mean, he's new and he...

23:14.960 --> 23:18.020
Oh, no. No, there is no way
he has anything to do with this.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.394
I can't believe you'd even say that.

23:20.465 --> 23:24.731
- Knock, knock. Is everything all right?
- Fine.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.601
It's fine, it's fine.
Oh, my, my.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.505
- My. Phil, you're soaking wet.
- Phil?

23:30.575 --> 23:35.274
This rain, it just...
it just came from nowhere.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.407
Oh, well, remarkably similar
to nowhere. Yes!

23:41.019 --> 23:43.579
So. I should let you get to your class.

23:46.224 --> 23:51.184
Unless... you'd like me to stay and help.
'Cause I can always help.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.996
Maybe you could help Aggie move
her things to a different room.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.001
- Aggie?
- A different room?

23:58.069 --> 24:01.129
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have
to reassign you in light of...

24:01.206 --> 24:04.141
- Stop it! Stop!
- ... what happened yesterday in class.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.973
Oh. Is this about the parrot?

24:07.045 --> 24:09.673
Parrot? What parrot?
I'm talking about the llama.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.807
Llama? What llama?

24:11.883 --> 24:14.147
I thought this was a progressive school.

24:14.219 --> 24:17.711
And I'll have you know
not one of my students went to sleep.

24:17.789 --> 24:23.125
True. Though one did get a little infection
when the llama spit in his eye.

24:23.195 --> 24:27.655
I'd like you to fill in over
in the history department, as a favor to me.

24:27.732 --> 24:31.498
Hm. How can I refuse?

24:33.371 --> 24:36.363
- Here, just take this.
- Give him to me.

24:54.192 --> 24:57.093
<i> Today's varsity football</i>
<i>practice has been canceled</i>

24:57.162 --> 24:58.652
<i>due to flooding on the field. </i>

24:58.730 --> 25:03.133
OK. Grandma, could we please try not
to draw any more attention to ourselves?

25:03.201 --> 25:07.661
- We're trying to blend in, remember?
- You don't have to worry about me.

25:07.739 --> 25:11.175
So welcome to history.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.939
Though "Modern Fiction"
might be a more apt title.

25:14.012 --> 25:18.711
So, we'll start with chapter 15.
"The Renaissance. "

25:18.783 --> 25:23.220
Oh. So many fond memories.

25:23.288 --> 25:28.055
Now, the Renaissance was also called
the Age of Enlightenment.

25:28.126 --> 25:32.756
and that's just because between the plague
and all of the boneheads in charge

25:32.831 --> 25:34.958
refusing to write things down.

25:35.033 --> 25:41.233
people pretty much forgot everything
they learned for the last 5.000 years.

25:41.306 --> 25:45.174
And divine the ancients were.
except for their breath.

25:45.243 --> 25:49.646
It's always hummus this and hummus that.
Oh, but that's another topic.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.649
It was also where we supposedly
discovered the New World.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.742
Yes.

25:54.819 --> 26:00.780
"New to whom?" is my question.
Now. I don't care what it says.

26:00.859 --> 26:04.124
Columbus did not discover America.

26:04.195 --> 26:07.255
He couldn't find his socks.
let alone a continent.

26:12.404 --> 26:17.000
Tomorrow, somebody remind me to tell you
a funny story about da Vinci.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.739
Oh, there was a good reason
the Mona Lisa was smiling.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.408
Who knows what she's talking about?

26:24.482 --> 26:26.746
She came with the rest of
those foreign exchange freaks.

26:26.818 --> 26:29.946
- Talk about a bunch of losers.
- I know.

26:38.396 --> 26:41.263
Hm.

26:41.800 --> 26:46.032
<i> Maintenance, please reset</i>
<i>all classroom clocks to the correct time. </i>

26:52.043 --> 26:53.806
- Hey!
- Hi!

26:53.878 --> 26:56.108
Am I a fool to save you a place?

26:56.181 --> 27:00.379
No, not a fool, but have you
seen any of my kids?

27:00.452 --> 27:03.944
Uh, no. You know.
I never really see them around.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.047
Yeah, why is that?

27:10.028 --> 27:12.087
Wait. There's one.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.996
Oh! Thank you!

27:17.969 --> 27:22.201
And I'm really looking
forward to Saturday, OK, bye.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.410
Hi, hi, hi.
You want to go sit over here?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.249
No, no, no. I didn't want to sit.

27:36.321 --> 27:39.347
I was observing the eating habits
of your average human.

27:39.424 --> 27:46.091
Apparently you cram as much food into
your mouth as possible, then start to talk.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.155
Yeah, OK.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.896
WI don't know if that's all humans.
but you definitely have teenage boys down.

27:52.937 --> 27:55.497
- Boys.
- She's writing a paper. Excuse us.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.667
Let's... Let's go.
Where's everybody else?

27:58.743 --> 28:01.473
- Oh, where they always are.
- Yeah, duh.

28:04.582 --> 28:05.571
There.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.452
There.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.425
Just got one question.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.298
What are you all doing here?

28:25.370 --> 28:29.101
We're not risking our futures so you guys
can hide out in the back of a locker.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.777
I mean, come on.
You guys gotta get out there, participate.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.074
Participate?
What do you mean, participate?

28:35.146 --> 28:37.080
Yeah, um...

28:37.148 --> 28:38.445
Ooh!

28:41.086 --> 28:43.816
Hey. Pete, think fast.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.551
- Good catch, bro!
- Nice one!

28:47.625 --> 28:51.061
Ah, see? There's no reason you shouldn't
try out for the football team.

28:51.129 --> 28:53.996
- Hm.
- Try your paws instead of your mouth.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.999
- Huh?
- What?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.467
No, that's really how they play.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.004
Yeah, she's right.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.903
Ooh, and Nancy.

29:02.974 --> 29:07.240
how about the gardening club?
No better gardener than a wood nymph.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.643
Mm-hm.

29:08.713 --> 29:13.912
And Chester, how about trying
for the wrestling team? Huh?

29:13.985 --> 29:17.477
- I don't like wrestling.
- Well, then what do you like?

29:17.555 --> 29:20.353
- I like stamps.
- Oh! Well, you know what?

29:20.425 --> 29:23.360
- There's a club for that, too.
- That's great.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.953
You know. I always
wanted to be in a play.

29:26.030 --> 29:29.227
Oh, that's great! You know what?
I think auditions are this week.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.736
See, we're all here to make connections
and celebrate common bonds.

29:32.804 --> 29:35.637
I mean, if we're gonna do it.
then let's do it right, right?

29:35.707 --> 29:39.336
- What can I do?
- You've already done enough. Trust me.

29:39.410 --> 29:42.538
I know! All the clubs are doing a booth
for the Halloween carnival.

29:42.614 --> 29:47.745
- We should do a booth, too.
- Oh! That's a wonderful idea.

29:48.386 --> 29:52.880
If anyone can show these mortals
a thing or two about Halloween...

29:52.957 --> 29:56.222
Maybe a haunted house.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.728
Ooh! That's a great idea.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.494
Hey. Cassie, you can be in charge
and give everybody a job.

30:02.567 --> 30:05.195
OK? So it's settled? We're all
gonna sign up for something?

30:05.270 --> 30:06.965
- Yeah!
- Great.

30:07.038 --> 30:10.474
I pity the knight that has to tussle with you.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.566
Ooh!

30:15.947 --> 30:17.812
Down! Set! Hike!

30:24.255 --> 30:28.351
Yes! Woo! Go. Pete!

30:30.228 --> 30:32.992
I come to you by that which you profess.

30:33.064 --> 30:35.692
How ere you come to know it.
answer me!

30:36.701 --> 30:38.066
He's pretty good.

30:38.136 --> 30:44.336
Oh. Shakespeare offered me a part in
the original production. Mm-hm!

31:29.053 --> 31:31.613
OK, guys, come on! Let's move.

31:34.659 --> 31:38.095
OK, guys, let's go!
Come on, move it!

31:38.162 --> 31:40.027
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.225
Ooh, there's that witty repartee again.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.668
All right, OK. Let's go, everybody.
Let's go to the car!

31:46.738 --> 31:49.502
Follow me, follow me, follow me.

31:52.877 --> 31:54.936
Yes, yes, yes.

31:55.013 --> 31:59.074
- No. I get the window seat!
- Everybody can have a window seat.

31:59.150 --> 32:02.551
Um, so did you want something?

32:02.620 --> 32:05.214
Uh, you mean other than a date?

32:05.290 --> 32:08.919
Well, shouldn't we get through
our first one before...

32:08.993 --> 32:10.858
Oh, no.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.365
You thought this was the first date.
Oh!

32:14.432 --> 32:17.868
See, when you said Saturday.
I thought you meant Saturday night.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.461
Come on! We've got interacting
and socializing to do!

32:20.538 --> 32:22.733
OK. I'm coming!

32:22.807 --> 32:25.435
We're going to the mall.
It's a big deal.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.570
They don't have malls in Canada?

32:29.113 --> 32:31.911
Um... So tonight, then?

32:31.983 --> 32:34.451
- Marnie!
- Tonight.

32:34.519 --> 32:37.682
Um, she's, uh...
OK, thanks.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.246
- Let's go.
- Wait, where did they all go?

32:40.325 --> 32:41.587
Bye!

32:42.593 --> 32:44.857
Why does none of this surprise me?

32:44.929 --> 32:48.092
Climb in, darling.
Here we go!

32:49.033 --> 32:50.022
OK.

32:55.239 --> 32:58.640
Boys in the back, come on!

32:58.710 --> 33:02.407
OK, now. I know this may seem
a little overwhelming at first.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.313
I mean, we're definitely
not in Halloweentown anymore.

33:05.383 --> 33:09.251
But if you really want to get
the full human world experience

33:09.320 --> 33:13.051
it's important that you sample
all of our customs.

33:13.124 --> 33:18.289
And like it or not, the mall is definitely
one of the most human things that...

33:18.363 --> 33:22.857
- Who are you talking to?
- I'm talking to the...

33:22.934 --> 33:24.265
I...

33:26.070 --> 33:28.538
Is...?

33:29.674 --> 33:34.111
Hm. Well. I guess it doesn't matter
what dimension you're from.

33:34.178 --> 33:38.012
- teenagers are teenagers.
- True.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.821
That's amazing. Are you sure you don't
have this game in Halloweentown?

33:45.890 --> 33:48.017
Positive.

33:48.426 --> 33:51.418
Oh! Look. I have the second-highest score.

33:51.496 --> 33:54.465
- Please note who's number one.
- Blasterdude.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.397
Guilty.

33:56.467 --> 34:00.927
Well, not for long.
I can spend all day playing this with you.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.100
Why are your glasses fogging up?

34:08.946 --> 34:10.607
Oh, wow!

34:10.681 --> 34:12.706
What do you think?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.809
That is such a cute hat.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.485
That's so cute!

34:35.005 --> 34:36.667
Yes!

34:40.411 --> 34:45.178
Well, yeah, he's cute, but I haven't said
one intelligent thing since I met the guy.

34:45.248 --> 34:48.581
I'm always making some lame excuse.
and then just running off.

34:48.652 --> 34:51.713
Maybe I should just tell him to forget it.

34:51.789 --> 34:54.417
Well, so he's gonna be very disappointed.

34:54.492 --> 34:59.930
Especially since he drove all the way
here and followed you to this spot.

34:59.997 --> 35:00.986
What...?

35:02.533 --> 35:06.970
Marnie? I can't believe it.
What are you...? I had no idea.

35:07.038 --> 35:10.940
- I mean, of all the malls in town...
- This is the only mall in town.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.306
- How lucky is that?
- Heh!

35:14.078 --> 35:15.773
You look fairly kid-free.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.907
Yeah, but I really can't leave
my grandmother alone.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.281
Aggie!

35:21.352 --> 35:23.650
But apparently you have
no trouble leaving me alone.

35:23.721 --> 35:27.851
- Sorry I'm late.
- See you back at the car.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.565
I'm really liking the mall.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.034
What?

35:44.442 --> 35:48.208
No wonder they're scared of us.
I'm scared of us.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.577
Aren't most werewolves vegetarians?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.548
Yeah, but he kind of looks like
my uncle Ernie.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.814
I hope this isn't what they're
expecting in our haunted house.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.983
Well. I find it offensive.
We're just a big joke.

36:00.057 --> 36:03.424
I mean, how many green witch zombies
do you know?

36:03.494 --> 36:05.724
Once a year
they'll dress up like us and laugh.

36:06.564 --> 36:09.055
Man, don't you just hate Halloween?
It's such a freak show.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.829
Seriously!

36:11.903 --> 36:16.237
- Uh, you're the freak.
- Ethan! Ethan!

36:16.307 --> 36:18.104
What did you just call me?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.612
So you think that anyone who has anything
to do with Halloween is a freak, huh?

36:21.679 --> 36:25.410
I bet you think all monsters want to do
is hide under people's beds.

36:25.483 --> 36:29.476
You probably think that all vampires
want to do is just suck people's blood.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.784
Like they don't have jobs and families...

36:31.856 --> 36:35.053
I'm warning you.
you better shut it, all right?

36:36.494 --> 36:38.485
Ethan, just back off.
Come on!

36:38.563 --> 36:42.124
So if Halloween is just about
scaring people.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.532
then why don't they make
a mask out of your face?

36:44.602 --> 36:46.194
That's it!

36:48.239 --> 36:50.036
Hey!

36:50.107 --> 36:53.372
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

36:53.444 --> 36:55.105
Aah!

37:00.885 --> 37:04.013
- What? You have to go already?
- Not me, you.

37:04.088 --> 37:07.785
It's been 15 minutes and you haven't
gone running off with a crazy excuse.

37:07.858 --> 37:11.055
I know. I'm sorry. It must seem
like I'm always running off.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.455
Oh, boy!

37:14.532 --> 37:18.127
Um... No, no, stay.
I'm just gonna go...

37:18.202 --> 37:22.662
It's kind of a little signal thing that they
worked out for when they... Excuse me.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.742
What is going on?

37:28.813 --> 37:32.408
I have no idea.
I left Phil in home appliances.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.280
Oh.

37:34.352 --> 37:35.910
What...?

37:35.987 --> 37:38.319
Oh, my gosh.
What is that?

37:41.926 --> 37:45.020
<i>Smoketeri congulte!</i>

38:03.047 --> 38:05.015
- What happened?
- I don't know.

38:09.720 --> 38:13.656
You're a troll!
You're a big pink furry troll!

38:13.724 --> 38:16.488
- So what?
- What do you mean "so what?"

38:16.560 --> 38:19.427
So what? I never want to see you again.
you stupid human, so what!

38:19.497 --> 38:20.862
Oh. Natalie, wait!

38:22.133 --> 38:23.998
Well, what happened?
Is everybody OK?

38:24.068 --> 38:26.434
There was a fight and this smoke
came out of nowhere.

38:26.504 --> 38:29.473
- I couldn't see anything.
- It's OK. Everything's gonna be fine.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.872
Come on. Ethan, let's go. What?

38:31.942 --> 38:35.673
The knights.
They tried...

38:42.453 --> 38:44.421
The dagger!

38:44.488 --> 38:50.893
Oh, hurry, everyone! Get back to the car.
Find Natalie. Go, go! Go, go!

38:50.961 --> 38:55.455
Hurry up! Get up, get up!
You're not that old. You can run, can't you?

38:55.533 --> 38:56.898
That's it! Go!

39:01.305 --> 39:05.571
<i>In breaking news, firefighters were</i>
<i>called to a local mall this afternoon</i>

39:05.643 --> 39:08.339
<i>when a mysterious purple smoke</i>
<i>forced the evacuation... </i>

39:08.412 --> 39:10.539
There! Home, safe and sound.

39:10.614 --> 39:15.347
Now you all go get cleaned up while
I conjure us up some hot chocolate.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.887
<i>Eyewitness accounts that monsters... </i>

39:17.955 --> 39:19.354
I miss everything.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.220
<i>Authorities have yet to determine... </i>

39:21.292 --> 39:23.760
Yeah. I'd kind of like to know
what happened today, too.

39:23.828 --> 39:26.296
<i>... security guard who</i>
<i>was eating a corn dog when... </i>

39:28.566 --> 39:31.501
I just... It doesn't add up.
I mean, the mall?

39:31.569 --> 39:35.232
There were no knights there.
and that puff of smoke.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.864
Somebody had to have been using magic.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.136
Marnie! Is everybody OK?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.405
- Everybody's fine.
- Yeah, we're fine.

39:41.479 --> 39:45.381
You're all good. Good.
We've got an even bigger problem.

39:45.449 --> 39:48.316
The Halloweentown council is here.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.911
They're waiting for you upstairs in...

39:55.593 --> 39:56.617
...your room.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.432
Uh, wow!

40:02.500 --> 40:06.834
You guys should do one of those home
makeover shows. You know, the bed...

40:06.904 --> 40:09.930
I really like what you did with my bedroom.

40:11.375 --> 40:14.173
Um, would now be a good time
to beg for mercy?

40:14.245 --> 40:16.509
Now, Marnie. I'm so sorry...

40:16.580 --> 40:20.072
No, no, no. Begging for mercy
is exactly what she should be doing.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.676
It was her callous disregard
for our children's safety...

40:22.753 --> 40:25.517
- Order!
- Honestly. Dalloway.

40:25.589 --> 40:30.117
- Your own son was attacked, so...
- I'll ask the questions.

40:30.194 --> 40:33.493
Marnie, why didn't you contact us
after the first threat at the school?

40:33.564 --> 40:35.623
Perhaps we could've done something.

40:35.699 --> 40:38.634
She thought we were going to
take her precious magic away.

40:38.702 --> 40:42.297
She cares more about the Cromwell magic
than she does our own children's lives!

40:42.373 --> 40:43.499
No!

40:44.742 --> 40:46.937
I thought the threat had come
from Halloweentown.

40:47.011 --> 40:52.244
That someone here was trying to
scare us into getting what they wanted -

40:52.316 --> 40:54.784
our magic and the portal sealed.

40:54.852 --> 41:00.119
I offer a compromise. We end
the program, shut down the portal.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.283
No, you can't do that!

41:01.358 --> 41:04.987
And you and your family
can keep your precious magic.

41:05.062 --> 41:07.394
Marnie, considering
everything that's happened.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.663
I think that's a very generous offer.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.033
We may never get this opportunity again...

41:14.104 --> 41:17.562
Listen, you little halfling! Just because
your father was a wretched human...

41:17.641 --> 41:20.075
- Humans never change!
- Order! Order!

41:20.144 --> 41:22.203
- I'm beginning to agree!
- Enough!

41:24.648 --> 41:25.808
Marnie?

41:28.619 --> 41:32.953
You said I have my magic
until midnight on Halloween, right?

41:33.023 --> 41:37.551
Well. I intend to use
every ounce of my power

41:37.628 --> 41:42.691
and every second of time to prove to you
that you are wrong about humans.

41:42.766 --> 41:45.792
So you know what?
Meeting adjourned!

42:02.253 --> 42:05.154
I had a chance to save our magic.

42:05.222 --> 42:08.714
But now that you're thinking clearer...

42:08.792 --> 42:12.125
would you have done it any differently?

42:12.196 --> 42:13.959
No.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.530
More hot chocolate?

42:34.084 --> 42:37.713
Don't you just love marshmallow spiders?

42:37.788 --> 42:39.585
Geronimo!

42:43.327 --> 42:47.661
Remind me again why
I don't like to use magic.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.627
Oh, honey bun.

42:53.170 --> 42:56.765
OK, enough wallowing.

42:56.840 --> 43:01.140
- You've still got charges to take care of.
- What, there's kids still here?

43:01.211 --> 43:05.443
I would've thought after this afternoon they
all would've gone back to Halloweentown.

43:05.516 --> 43:11.944
No. Some of them are just
as stubborn as you are.

43:20.064 --> 43:23.659
- Did you see the way...
- I think I'm going to turn in.

43:25.202 --> 43:26.294
Grandma. I...

43:26.370 --> 43:30.773
It wasn't yours to bet in the first place.
and then they offered to let us keep it.

43:30.841 --> 43:32.138
Ooh! Ooh!

43:39.516 --> 43:41.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:41.218 --> 43:44.153
Thought you guys would've had
the good enough sense to go home.

43:44.221 --> 43:48.385
Yeah. I tried, but my dad...
We'd never abandon you.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.120
We were there.
There weren't any knights.

43:50.194 --> 43:53.891
- Yeah, there were just a couple of punks.
- And most of it was our fault.

43:53.964 --> 43:57.491
This... This wasn't my fault.

43:57.568 --> 44:01.834
Look, if we all just stick together.
we'll figure out what's going on.

44:02.406 --> 44:05.705
Yeah, good luck.
We only have till next week.

44:05.776 --> 44:08.301
We are so gonna do this.

44:12.182 --> 44:15.948
If you don't start talking to me.
we're definitely gonna lose our magic.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.421
Fine.
But what am I supposed to do?

44:19.490 --> 44:23.153
Everyone suddenly
looks suspicious to me.

44:23.227 --> 44:28.392
- Oh, well, not everyone. Good morning!
- Aggie!

44:28.465 --> 44:30.729
You are nothing but a little flirt.
you know that?

44:30.801 --> 44:32.359
I know.

44:32.436 --> 44:34.028
- Hello.
- Aggie, can I talk to you?

44:34.104 --> 44:36.231
Of course.
What's the problem?

44:36.306 --> 44:38.934
I don't quite know how to say this.

44:39.009 --> 44:44.072
but I think that history
may not be the best place for you.

44:44.148 --> 44:46.981
Oh, but I love history.

44:47.051 --> 44:50.418
I try and bring it to life every time.

44:50.487 --> 44:53.979
Well, actually.
that's part of the problem.

44:54.058 --> 44:58.893
Parents have been complaining about.
well, some of your teaching methods.

45:00.631 --> 45:03.225
Oh, it's just this old briefcase.

45:03.300 --> 45:07.964
It keeps coming open
and snapping closed on things.

45:08.038 --> 45:11.474
- I guess I'll just have to replace it.
- Yeah.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.807
- Oh, can I help you sew that back on?
- Well, yes.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.345
Ah.

45:17.381 --> 45:21.545
I said I was sorry, like.
12 to the ninth power times.

45:21.618 --> 45:26.646
It was such a shock. I'm just used to you
looking all cute, and well, you know. I...

45:26.724 --> 45:29.955
Here's a newsflash for you.
I don't think I look better this way.

45:30.027 --> 45:31.016
What?!

45:31.095 --> 45:34.531
I'm all pale and hairless.
It's gross.

45:34.598 --> 45:36.930
Well, you're normally
a big pink puffball.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.404
I know! People back home think
I'm beautiful. I'm a junior miss!

45:42.473 --> 45:44.464
Well, wait, then you must think I'm...

45:44.541 --> 45:47.999
One of the ugliest creatures
I've ever laid my eyes on.

45:48.078 --> 45:53.311
but I thought you were sweet and nice.
That's all that mattered.

45:55.352 --> 45:59.846
- Wait, you think I'm funny-looking?
- Ooh, talk about being the last to know.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.481
It's OK.

46:01.558 --> 46:03.651
Marnie, Marnie, Marnie!

46:03.727 --> 46:05.888
- Come quick! Come quick! Come quick!
- What?!

46:07.030 --> 46:08.964
Girls, stop!
No running in the hallway!

46:12.703 --> 46:16.195
Somebody really wanted to get inside.

46:20.244 --> 46:22.178
What?

46:29.753 --> 46:32.722
Doesn't look like anybody
was in here except for us.

46:37.761 --> 46:39.695
I don't get it.

46:39.763 --> 46:41.196
What's the matter?

46:41.265 --> 46:44.996
It's good that nobody got in here, right?

46:45.068 --> 46:47.468
I guess, but...

46:47.538 --> 46:50.666
I mean, if we were dealing with
somebody from Halloweentown.

46:50.741 --> 46:54.177
they wouldn't have
had to smash their way in.

46:54.244 --> 46:59.238
So maybe we really are dealing
with somebody from this world.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.647
I have to talk to Grandma.

47:00.717 --> 47:03.811
Well, wait.
What do you want me to do?

47:03.887 --> 47:06.355
Uh, just stay here.
You'll be safe.

47:22.039 --> 47:24.803
Marnie, are you still here?

47:41.024 --> 47:45.324
Let's choose up sides.
and then we can play our little...

47:45.395 --> 47:47.727
- What's this called again?
- Basketball.

47:47.798 --> 47:50.426
Oh, basketball!

47:50.500 --> 47:53.958
All right, let's go. Just hit it, boys.
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it.

47:55.305 --> 47:57.796
Grandma.

47:57.875 --> 48:02.369
Why must you be so difficult?
As if any of this is my fault.

48:02.446 --> 48:06.314
Oh! Well, you know what? I'm guessing
the only reason they even know we're here

48:06.383 --> 48:10.945
is because you can't go two seconds
without turning someone into a lamppost.

48:11.021 --> 48:12.613
One time.

48:12.689 --> 48:17.922
And I don't think a little harmless magic
told them the location of our clubhouse.

48:17.995 --> 48:22.329
but if there's one thing I can do.
it's keep a secret.

48:22.399 --> 48:24.264
Oh, and what is that
supposed to mean?

48:24.334 --> 48:26.097
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

48:26.169 --> 48:30.071
but maybe you just said
a little something to your little friend.

48:30.140 --> 48:31.402
Oh, my little friend?

48:31.475 --> 48:33.670
You know what?
Now that you mention it.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.042
the other day in homeroom I was, like.

48:36.113 --> 48:40.311
"Hey, Cody, guess what?
I'm a witch and I have a secret clubhouse. "

48:40.384 --> 48:42.511
I just think it's a little odd, you know.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.555
I mean, first of all he shows up
at the school on the same day.

48:45.622 --> 48:48.056
then he comes to our house
and then the mall.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.958
Whoa, whoa, wait.
You think it's odd that he likes me?

48:51.028 --> 48:54.486
Oh. I didn't say that, but we have to
be open to the possibilities.

48:54.564 --> 48:56.361
There's no possibility.
You know why?

48:56.433 --> 49:00.335
- 'Cause I'm done talking to you.
- Good, because I'm through listening.

49:00.404 --> 49:02.929
Fine!

49:04.574 --> 49:07.509
Come, boys!
Come here.

49:17.287 --> 49:19.152
Calm down. It's just me.

49:19.222 --> 49:21.349
- Sorry.
- So?

49:22.326 --> 49:23.384
So?

49:23.460 --> 49:25.451
So what is going on?

49:25.529 --> 49:28.191
I think you owe me
at least some sort of explanation.

49:28.265 --> 49:32.395
I mean, the mall. What was that?
And then you stood me up.

49:32.469 --> 49:35.529
I'm sorry about all of it.
I just. I can't...

49:35.605 --> 49:38.904
And what the heck's
in that mysterious locker of yours?

49:38.976 --> 49:40.568
You know about the locker?

49:40.644 --> 49:45.513
Yeah. I saw the note that your grandma
gave you on the first day.

49:45.582 --> 49:48.278
Aggie was right.

49:48.352 --> 49:51.788
I can't believe it. I don't know what
game you're trying to play.

49:51.855 --> 49:54.881
but I'm warning you.
you better knock it off, now.

49:54.958 --> 49:59.486
Hey, don't worry. The only thing I was
trying to do was to get to know you better.

49:59.563 --> 50:01.895
I like you.

50:01.965 --> 50:04.263
Didn't know that was a crime.

50:16.446 --> 50:19.438
Hello? Is anybody here?
Hello?

50:45.575 --> 50:48.100
Cassie? Cassie!

50:51.948 --> 50:54.075
Cassie.

50:58.021 --> 50:59.648
Oh, no.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.920
Where are you? Oh.

51:04.061 --> 51:07.292
Poor Cassie.
I can't believe they got her.

51:07.364 --> 51:09.355
Do you think they're gonna
come after us next?

51:09.433 --> 51:11.094
No, you have nothing to worry about.

51:11.168 --> 51:12.328
How can you say that?

51:12.402 --> 51:15.667
- Because you're all going home.
- What?!

51:15.739 --> 51:18.970
No. I don't want to risk
this happening to anybody else.

51:19.810 --> 51:23.610
You're all going home, even if
it means losing my magic, then...

51:25.015 --> 51:27.984
Oh, don't pack your broomsticks just yet.

51:28.051 --> 51:31.020
Grandma! I was beginning to
think you had disappeared, too.

51:31.088 --> 51:36.185
Oh, no. I was doing a little investigating
and I needed your mother's help.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.658
Aggie put a spell on the clubhouse.

51:37.727 --> 51:40.059
Something I remembered
from the Dark Days.

51:40.130 --> 51:43.395
It's a spell to prevent humans
from crossing the threshold.

51:43.467 --> 51:46.493
We checked the clubhouse
and the spell hasn't been broken.

51:46.570 --> 51:50.336
Wait. So that means that somebody from
Halloweentown was definitely responsible.

51:50.407 --> 51:52.466
Or it could just mean that it's one of us.

51:52.542 --> 51:54.100
Ow! Well, it could!

51:54.177 --> 51:57.840
So no one is going back
to Halloweentown just yet.

51:57.914 --> 52:01.372
We all have to try
and stick together, all of us.

52:01.451 --> 52:05.888
even though one of us
is a pigheaded old woman

52:05.956 --> 52:10.222
who can't stop using magic
for two seconds.

52:10.293 --> 52:16.198
Or if one of us is in over her head
and says stupid, selfish things

52:16.266 --> 52:19.030
because she's scared and frustrated.

52:19.102 --> 52:21.468
We definitely have to stick together.

52:22.272 --> 52:24.069
Oh. Grandma. I love you.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.234
Do you ever get the feeling
you missed something?

52:26.309 --> 52:30.905
All the time.
I'm the mother of teenagers.

52:30.981 --> 52:36.510
We still have to send for help.
Our first priority has to be to find Cassie.

52:36.586 --> 52:39.020
- If there's any of her left to find.
- Dylan!

52:39.089 --> 52:43.082
I wouldn't worry too much about Cassie.
Witches, even young.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.924
are pretty tough, you know...

52:45.996 --> 52:49.796
There's only one thing
strong enough to hold them.

52:49.866 --> 52:52.994
- A witch's glass.
- Do any of you have one?

52:53.069 --> 52:56.766
Ethan has one. He uses it
to call his dad all the time.

52:56.840 --> 53:01.800
- Oh, go get it.
- Wait, don't you have one?

53:01.878 --> 53:04.369
I think I see something
going by the window.

53:04.447 --> 53:06.745
Hm. Eyes in the back of her head.

53:06.816 --> 53:10.718
Explains why I never
got away with anything growing up.

53:10.787 --> 53:11.845
I just saw it, too.

53:11.922 --> 53:15.119
Hm. Which explains why we never
got away with anything.

53:15.192 --> 53:19.128
Keep talking. Just...

53:28.471 --> 53:30.530
- Hey!
- <i>Krepto fragilius!</i>

53:33.510 --> 53:35.478
Mom!

53:36.379 --> 53:39.143
We've got a problem. Uh...

53:40.717 --> 53:42.742
Mom!

53:44.421 --> 53:48.050
- Oh, Cody.
- Is he a knight?

53:48.124 --> 53:51.821
No, he's just a big idiot
that keeps trying to be my prince.

53:51.895 --> 53:56.195
Oh, he brought me flowers.
Oh. Mom, how could you?!

53:56.266 --> 54:02.330
I'm so sorry. But you know.
he should wake up soon... ish. Sorta.

54:13.550 --> 54:16.485
- <i>Hey!</i>
- What are you doing in there?

54:16.553 --> 54:18.544
<i>What do you mean what am I doing here?</i>
<i>Somebody put me in here. </i>

54:18.622 --> 54:20.954
- <i>Now get me out!</i>
- I can't.

54:21.024 --> 54:23.219
- <i>Ethan, what is going on?</i>
- I don't know.

54:30.166 --> 54:31.895
Come in.

54:32.702 --> 54:33.964
Everything all right?

54:34.037 --> 54:35.629
Yeah.

54:35.705 --> 54:38.936
Oh. I know you and Cassie
were good friends.

54:39.009 --> 54:41.000
but try not to worry too much.

54:41.077 --> 54:45.844
I'm sure she's gonna be
just fine... wherever she is.

54:45.915 --> 54:47.177
Hm, what?

54:47.250 --> 54:48.308
Oh, uh...

54:48.385 --> 54:50.945
Oh, right, wherever.

54:51.021 --> 54:53.046
Yes...

54:54.324 --> 54:58.226
- Good night.
- Good night. Sweet dreams.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.640
Come in.

55:18.648 --> 55:21.344
Hi. Grandma.
Is everyone in bed?

55:21.418 --> 55:24.979
Oh, almost everyone.
Are you gonna go out?

55:25.055 --> 55:28.422
Yes, Cody should be waking up soon.
so I thought I should take him home.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.981
Want to borrow my car?

55:30.060 --> 55:33.223
Oh, no, that's OK.
I have my own method of transportation.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.558
Hm...

55:34.631 --> 55:37.532
- See ya later.
- See you later.

55:38.134 --> 55:40.568
More like me every day. Ha!

55:51.514 --> 55:52.879
What happened?

55:52.949 --> 55:56.646
Um, let's just say there was a little mix-up.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.154
but thanks for the flowers.

55:59.222 --> 56:01.588
Oh, sure.

56:01.658 --> 56:04.092
I have the worst taste in my mouth.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.254
Oh, that's magic.
It tastes awful.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.890
What are you talking about?

56:10.967 --> 56:13.595
Cody... I'm a witch.

56:13.670 --> 56:15.467
Marnie...

56:23.747 --> 56:25.715
I was kinda hoping you'd do that.

56:25.782 --> 56:29.775
I'm-I'm dreaming.
I'm-I'm hallucinating.

56:29.853 --> 56:36.918
- Actually, it's called hovering.
- What? So you really are a...

56:36.993 --> 56:40.292
Which explains all the stuff at school
and why you're always disappearing.

56:40.363 --> 56:45.130
Ah, yes. I just learned how to do that.
actually. Level two.

56:47.804 --> 56:52.503
What? How? Why?
Where are you from?

56:52.575 --> 56:55.510
Hey, we have a lot of time for questions.

56:55.578 --> 56:59.139
Right now, let's just have some fun, OK?

56:59.215 --> 57:01.183
Hold on!

57:02.819 --> 57:03.808
Whoo!

57:06.156 --> 57:07.783
Whoo!

57:07.857 --> 57:10.382
Ooh.

57:11.461 --> 57:13.452
Whoa.

57:16.132 --> 57:18.362
Ha-ha!

57:19.302 --> 57:22.328
Yeah, still rides like a charm.

57:22.405 --> 57:23.633
Ha-ha!

57:23.706 --> 57:26.004
- Yeah, that's something.
- Whoo!

57:47.430 --> 57:49.489
Where's my dad?!

57:50.300 --> 57:53.360
He isn't here yet.

57:57.407 --> 58:00.808
Must you always travel
with that stupid door?

58:00.877 --> 58:02.174
What if somebody sees you?

58:02.245 --> 58:06.648
What if someone had seen you drawing
an iron dagger at your little school?

58:06.716 --> 58:09.879
Some things are just worth taking the risk.

58:09.953 --> 58:12.888
What is this?
Did you do this to Cassie?

58:12.956 --> 58:15.982
What, no hug for your old man?

58:17.560 --> 58:21.189
Hm. Yes, unfortunate, but necessary.

58:21.264 --> 58:24.927
You have a girl trapped in there?

58:25.001 --> 58:28.903
<i>Hey, knock it off. </i>
<i>Mr. Flanagan?</i>

58:28.972 --> 58:33.739
Yes. For centuries.
my family has been keeping a vigil.

58:33.810 --> 58:38.611
a vigil to ensure that our world
remains pure of the magical.

58:39.382 --> 58:43.011
I'm the last remaining descendant
of a noble order.

58:43.086 --> 58:46.078
Please.
You wouldn't have even known

58:46.155 --> 58:50.251
that the Knights of the Iron Dagger existed
if I hadn't found you and told you.

58:50.326 --> 58:52.624
But I'm still a knight, right?

58:52.695 --> 58:56.392
Yes, of course.
All hail.

58:58.535 --> 59:02.096
Dad, how could you?
She's my friend.

59:02.171 --> 59:03.763
You didn't seem too worried
about your friends

59:03.840 --> 59:07.799
when you stirred up that trouble at the mall
or plunged the dagger into the pumpkin.

59:07.877 --> 59:14.146
You're lucky that I was there to give you
some cover. It's pathetic. How long...?

59:14.217 --> 59:17.084
But you are such a good boy.

59:17.153 --> 59:20.384
Did everything you were told. I...

59:20.456 --> 59:25.416
You said no one was gonna get hurt.
You said they would just give up.

59:25.495 --> 59:27.656
- You said that...
- Yes. I know what I said.

59:27.730 --> 59:29.925
But when the good people
of Halloweentown realize

59:29.999 --> 59:31.899
that humans have not changed.

59:31.968 --> 59:37.338
that they are still these lying.
backward, wretched creatures...

59:37.774 --> 59:40.174
No offense.

59:40.243 --> 59:45.237
Then they'll understand that this portal
must be closed permanently.

59:45.315 --> 59:47.875
A separate world for freaks?

59:47.951 --> 59:49.475
I'm all for it.

59:49.552 --> 59:51.281
Nothing's going to stop us now.

59:51.354 --> 59:53.481
<i>The Cromwells will stop you. </i>

59:55.191 --> 59:59.150
No, not without their magic.
they won't.

59:59.228 --> 01:00:03.028
And at midnight on Halloween...

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:06.296
the Cromwell magic is going to be mine.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.808
Well, if you're right.
whoever is behind all this

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:16.140
won't stop until they prove
to the council that we failed.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.873
And we won't fail.

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:23.510
There's nothing that Cromwell women
can't do if they set their minds to it.

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.653
We all know what we have to do?

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.356
I think so.

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:38.264
Then we better get started.

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.030
Wish me luck finding Cassie.

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:51.646
It's very important that
we keep our eyes open

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.705
and that we're aware of our surroundings.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.650
Aggie. I am so sorry about...

01:00:56.719 --> 01:01:00.177
Oh, shoot.
Being reassigned again.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:03.419
Honestly, these kids are so whiny.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.690
So he lost an ear.
It's not like it won't grow back.

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:09.095
No, you're doing just fine.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:11.565
though I hadn't heard about the ear.

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:15.365
No. I'm just sorry that we're not gonna
have your haunted house in our carnival.

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:19.807
Why wouldn't we do our haunted house?
We're actually going there right now.

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:25.678
Oh. Well. I just thought with so many
of your students going back to Canada...

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.184
I can't wait.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.460
Being aware of my surroundings as I am.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.557
that seemed highly suspicious.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:47.125
- What. Phil?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.934
Oh, no.
I can't believe you'd suspect him.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:55.239
Honestly, Marnie.
He's not... He's...

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.836
I hate paybacks.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.745
Fine.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.409
You just don't want me to be happy.

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:08.514
Ugh. Somebody really lost an ear?
Who is it?

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:27.133
<i> Mr. Flanagan, </i>
<i>you're needed in the front office. </i>

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.678
I'll be right in.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.231
OK. I'm thinking that the haunted house
just isn't such a good idea.

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:58.504
Everybody else just set up booths
and they're already done.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:03.170
Uh, need I
remind you I'm a witch?

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.146
- Oh.
- Hm.

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.682
Look, hardhats, everyone.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:13.855
- Come on, let's get out of here!
- <i>Togos beerai contus... </i>

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.016
Marnie. Hey.

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:19.289
Hi! Hey.
How's it going?

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:23.355
You tell me. I think I had
this really crazy dream last night

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:26.333
where you and I were flying...

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.869
Marnie!

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:30.735
What? Oh. Sorry.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.037
Uh. <i>fragiliotose!</i>

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:36.836
Oh, my gosh!

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.381
- You told me that you were a...
- Come on, let's go.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:43.407
- Thanks, Marnie.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.886
Ah!

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.388
Check that out, man.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.220
Now, what did I say I was?

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:53.353
Uh, you said you were a...
How...?

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:57.432
You really are a witch.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.399
It wasn't a dream.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:07.102
No, it wasn't a dream.
Is there a problem?

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:10.612
Um... I don't think so.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.172
Still in the processing stage.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.051
- You're the good kind, right?
- Yes, definitely the good kind.

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.420
Marnie?!

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:24.391
- What?
- The walls keep dissolving.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.950
Hm.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:30.988
You know. I can conjure floors for days.
but walls - they're tricky.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:34.559
Um. I should go.
We'll talk later?

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:36.628
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:44.472
- Where did that...?
- I...

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.446
Why did you do that?

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.054
Hey! Open the door!

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:58.455
Here's that bag of yours.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.791
I feel like such a fool.
He is a knight.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:13.331
You're not a fool.
A flirt, maybe, but not a fool.

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.843
Well, at least we know.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.279
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.714
OK, guys, listen up.
I've got it all figured out.

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:23.274
I'm gonna go check on Dylan.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:26.082
...greatest haunted house ever.
I'm telling you.

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:28.248
This is gonna be really cool.

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:32.624
We'll make it super-scary
with buckets and buckets of fake blood.

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:34.996
It's gonna be scary, right?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.924
- Um...
- Come on, it's a haunted house.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:41.367
But isn't the point
to try and get people to like us?

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.302
I'm tired of people being scared of us.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:46.000
Yeah, you know what?
So am I.

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.839
Whoever heard of a haunted house
without buckets of fake blood?

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:49.969
Hello!

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:53.038
- What is that?
- I have a sensitive...

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.276
Aggie.

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:58.684
I just want to say
that I expected more of you.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:04.121
Where did you get this? How...?

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:07.594
I hope that you know that
the men you're trying to emulate.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:10.826
the men that originally wore those rings.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.303
they were bigoted, hideous.
evil human beings.

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:21.003
And to be honest.
I'm a little surprised that it fits.

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:23.910
Aggie!

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:40.023
Happy Halloween.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:38.414
It's almost midnight.
Maybe they won't try anything.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:41.923
No. This is as important to them
as it is to us.

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:46.519
only we have a lot more to lose.
Just be ready.

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:48.529
Oh! Watch your step.

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:50.064
Have fun.
Enjoy yourselves.

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:53.795
OK, that was the worst haunted house
I've ever seen.

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.928
The ghosts didn't even go. "boo. "

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.596
I know.

01:07:57.673 --> 01:08:02.576
"Boo"? How many ghosts
do you know that say "boo"?

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.216
People are laughing.

01:08:08.284 --> 01:08:11.412
"Dances with Werewolves"?
"The Monster Tea Party"?

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:15.617
There's not even a gross-out factor.
They're eating chocolate-chip cookies!

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:18.353
Can't we at least have mealy worms
crawling out of them?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.362
My mom makes the best
oatmeal mealy worm cookies.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.398
Happy Halloween!
Anyone care to hear about

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:26.332
the positive contributions
trolls have made to society?

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.029
Um, welcome to
the Halloween Wax Museum.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:33.667
See the ogres picnicking
in their natural setting.

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.506
Excuse me.
would you like to see the...

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:47.545
Whoa! OK, now.
that was pretty cool.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:50.251
Yeah. That was the best thing in here.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:57.956
Seems to me this haunted house
could use a little excitement.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.703
What's goin' on?

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:11.939
OK, don't run. It'll be OK.

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.754
Dad, no!

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.990
That's OK.
Come with me.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.731
- Ooh.
- What?

01:09:33.801 --> 01:09:36.999
Oh, my, let's go.
This is what we've been waiting for.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.090
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:06.691
<i>Krepto fragilius!</i>

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:17.737
<i>Krepto fragilius!</i>

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:24.208
Oh! What did I do?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.724
<i>Krepto fragilius!</i>

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.929
Grandma, what's going on?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.340
Oh, my. Oh!

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.404
Oh, oh!

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.778
<i>Krepto fragilius!</i>

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.447
No!

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.819
Help! Oh!

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.228
- Marnie, Marnie, Marnie!
- Grandma!

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:15.770
What's happening? Why are you
using your magic this way?

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.635
No, Cody, it's not what you think.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.071
I thought you said you were the good kind.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:23.578
I am! I don't know what's wrong!
You have to believe me.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.876
Grandma, it's not working!

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.506
Look!

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:45.391
<i>Krepto thundris!</i>

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.526
Be gone!

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:04.585
Whoa!

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.823
Did you see that?

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.836
Did you see what they did?
They tried to destroy us.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:23.269
No! That's not true...

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.704
- You saw it!
- Yeah!

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.900
They caused everything!

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:31.344
They are witches and monsters and freaks!

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:34.712
No! We're your friends!

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:38.048
If we don't drive them
back to where they came from.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.917
they will destroy us!

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:44.118
We're trying to help you! Come on. I've
known most of you since the first grade!

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.994
- Marnie, it's almost midnight.
- Hey, it's us or them!

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:50.292
Yeah!

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.391
Who's it gonna be?!

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.368
Them!

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:57.303
Uh... Grandma!

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.397
Go get 'em!

01:12:58.474 --> 01:13:00.101
Yeah!

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.574
Whoo!

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:10.614
You've got to do something. Don't you
know a spell to get us out of here?

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.883
I'm afraid the time for spells is over.

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:16.686
I was right!

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:19.887
You are responsible for all of this.

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:23.127
I can't take all the credit.

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:26.231
- Ethan?!
- Marnie.

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:30.795
it seems your little experiment
has come to an end. It's time to pay up.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:35.435
No! No, you can't take our magic.
Humans have changed.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:37.809
No one was threatening us
until you showed up.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.974
Well, that's just because they never
got to know the real you.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:46.146
And now that they do...
you Cromwells don't deserve magic.

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:48.655
Now your magic is mine.

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:51.192
<i>Magicus fixum!</i>

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:55.962
Our magic! Ah!

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:03.299
Marnie!

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.540
He... took my magic.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:10.176
Aggie!

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.770
Aggie! Is she hurt?

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:18.643
What do you care? You're the one
who offered her up to an angry mob.

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.181
Ethan.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.319
No.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:33.234
- I'm staying.
- A disappointment right to the very end.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:37.204
Well, then this is goodbye to all of you.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:55.747
This doorway linking our two worlds
should never have existed.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:15:00.022
And now, with my newfound powers.

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:03.553
I can make sure that it never will again.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:14.042
No! He can't do that!
Somebody's gotta stop him!

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:18.379
Halloweentown - it's gone!

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.438
Yeah!

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:27.345
What is the matter with you people?
Marnie is your friend.

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:29.322
So she's different.

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:33.794
Now that she's lost her magic.
are you gonna like her again?

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:36.296
I kept thinking
that we needed to fit in.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.266
but how do you know if someone
truly cares about you

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:42.735
if you don't show them
who you really are?

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.070
OK.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.441
Oh!

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.949
I'm really a werewolf.

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:03.856
Sweet!

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:08.393
That is so freaky!

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:14.333
I'm an ogre. With a little bit of
forest giant on my mother's side.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.167
What on Earth?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.730
And I'm a troll.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.773
I'm just going through an awkward stage.

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:26.575
This is all there is.
Sorry.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:32.186
And these are the people
you want destroyed?

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.848
- Sure, they look different, but...
- Yeah, they do.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.483
...are they really
any different on the inside?

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:43.186
I don't know what werewolves
are like inside.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:46.962
but Pete's the best halfback
we've ever had!

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:50.527
- Natalie's president of the science club.
- Uh, co-president.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.301
You know what?

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:55.104
You were right, Aggie.

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.737
This never really fit.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:05.175
See? Humans really have changed.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:11.886
Now, has everybody seen everything
that they need to see in the witch's glass?

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.325
Ooh. Welcome back.

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:24.164
- Cassie!
- Gwen rescued me!

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:27.902
It took some time, but I finally
found the right witch's glass.

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.208
What is going on?

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:34.840
You forgot that witches' glasses.
while excellent for imprisoning witches.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:38.147
are also good for communicating
between the worlds.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:43.624
And I believe that all of Halloweentown
just saw that humans have changed.

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.023
Which means...

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.887
<i> Magico faxum!</i>

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:58.030
You can't do this to me!
I won't let you get away with this!

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:02.543
But we will.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:05.041
No, no, you don't understand.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:08.742
I was doing this for the good of
Halloweentown. You see, humans...

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:12.913
Are apparently much more accepting
than you led us to believe.

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.081
If they're willing to give us a chance.

01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:17.682
then we should be willing to
return the favor.

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.386
- We did it.
- No!

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:25.127
- No! I absolutely forbid it!
- Then we'll consider this your resignation.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.137
<i>Let me outta here!</i>

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.701
I'll deal with you later!

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:42.113
But right now we still have to
put on the haunted house, right?

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:44.118
Yeah!

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.586
Happy Halloween!

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.816
Happy Halloween!

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.360
Yes!

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:01.424
Yeah!

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.472
Come on, guys! Ah!

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:20.721
All right! Whoo! Yeah!

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:32.226
- I'm really sorry I...
- No, no. I'm sorry.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.326
I would have acted the same way
if things were reversed.

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:38.270
I just never met a girl like you before.

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:42.208
We have so much in common.
and I like being with you.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:45.178
I feel the same way.

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:50.207
No. I'm sorry.
It's just too gross!

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.853
- Thank goodness. Friends?
- Friends.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:01.620
I...

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:06.065
I certainly hope I can convince you
to stay on at the school.

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:09.328
Oh. Well. I don't know.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:13.465
- We'd have to make a few changes.
- Changes?

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:16.670
Something has to be done
about the athletic department.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:21.705
I mean, really, who ever heard of
field hockey without flying monkeys?

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:29.485
Mother, have you seen Marnie anywhere?

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.726
Oh, sure.

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:36.730
She's just hangin' around somewhere.
