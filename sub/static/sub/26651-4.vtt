05:55.440 --> 05:59.720
Comrade Dietrich,
please update us on the numbers.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.080
Yes.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.560
The latest from our sanitation initiative
is very positive.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.800
The expansion of waste collection
from many West German urban centers,

06:08.880 --> 06:11.880
Hamburg, Cologne, Frankfurt,
has been a success.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.120
Last year we collected three million
cubic meters of household waste

06:16.200 --> 06:17.720
from West Berlin alone.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.440
I'm pleased to announce that

06:21.520 --> 06:24.040
since we began the initiative,

06:24.120 --> 06:26.960
we've amassed a net profit
of one billion West Deutschmarks.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.240
Very good,
Comrade Dietrich.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
Excuse me.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.360
We're letting the West dump its trash here
just to balance our books?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.440
Isn't that beneath us?

06:38.520 --> 06:41.320
Why shouldn't we profit
from the West's excessive consumption?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
Well.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.840
For a billion Deutschmarks...

06:46.800 --> 06:47.800
Who are you anyway?

06:47.880 --> 06:49.400
Comrade Schweppenstette.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.360
He's new to our special unit.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.400
-Special Commission.

Please walk us through it.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.800
Gladly.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.480
A certain Werner Esselbaum,
a television producer in West Berlin,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.600
has agreed to broker

07:14.200 --> 07:18.440
the sale of a new cruise ship
for our most distinguished workers.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
Well, this ship...

07:20.280 --> 07:22.520
is not just any ship.

07:23.080 --> 07:26.520
It's the very cruise ship
that until recently was used

07:27.480 --> 07:32.160
for the ZDF's
legendary TV show, The Love Boat.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.960
Which is to say,

07:35.760 --> 07:38.680
the platonic ideal of a cruise ship.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.880
How much does that thing cost?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.560
I already told you, you've got 90 million.
Not a penny more.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.640
Just listen.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.960
We'll make up the additional cost
by taking eight rooms

07:49.040 --> 07:52.000
out of the bottom floor
of the boat here to make room

07:52.080 --> 07:55.120
to hide sensitive cargo
bound for South Africa.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.800
And by sensitive, I mean

07:57.880 --> 07:59.600
very valuable cargo.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.200
As you know,

08:01.280 --> 08:05.240
UN sanctions make it very difficult
for western manufacturers

08:05.320 --> 08:06.960
to sell goods to South Africa officially.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.320
But our cruise ship

08:09.560 --> 08:11.360
is the perfect hiding place

08:11.440 --> 08:14.480
while our distinguished workers

08:14.920 --> 08:18.000
enjoy a grand view of the sea
from up on deck.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.640
Due to Comrade Rauch's
work in South Africa,

08:22.120 --> 08:25.240
we have a direct line to
help on the ground there

08:25.320 --> 08:27.440
who can facilitate deals for us

08:27.720 --> 08:29.640
so we can deliver anything

08:30.680 --> 08:32.560
the West Germans want to sell
to South Africa.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.440
Vehicles, chemicals, weapons.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.280
Completely under the radar.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.440
And you thought shoveling their shit
was beneath us.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.440
It's a brilliant idea.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.160
Please continue.

was so much crueler than the crime.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.680
In jail I was interrogated,
isolated, threatened, confused.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.400
I copped to destruction of property
pretty quickly.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.120
Trespassing, too.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.760
But treason?

09:15.240 --> 09:17.440
My crime was just youthful rebellion.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.400
What is youth without rebellion anyway?
A youth spent in East Germany.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.280
We'll broadcast this out of West Berlin
in range of East German radios,

09:25.360 --> 09:27.800
so people from
both sides of the Wall can hear it.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.080
Pffft. There are dozens of people
who want to speak up...

09:30.160 --> 09:31.600
Are you out of your minds?

09:32.240 --> 09:34.520
Those people are unprotected.
You'll put them in danger.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.160
You play their stories on the radio,

09:36.360 --> 09:38.440
and you're playing with their lives.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.640
You always want to be a hero, Thomas.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.040

was so much crueler than the crime.

In jail I was interrogated,
isolated, threatened, confused.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.960
I copped to destruction of property...

09:57.280 --> 09:58.880
And we've changed all the names.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.360
You don't know who you're dealing with.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.000
If this recording plays in East Berlin,
prison will be the least of her worries.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.360
Well, Tobias.
Then you can just buy her out.

10:08.440 --> 10:09.520
Excuse me?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.080
Buy her from the East German government,
like you bought me.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.520
Saving East German dissidents
always makes a good story over here.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.720
I'm not the one with a novel about
East Germany on the bestseller list.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
Hmm.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.600

to the West German Government, hmm?

but not in this form.

citizens has just fallen into my lap.

Could you be more specific?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.360
I need more time.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.200
Besides, we're recovering from
our exhausting trip to Cape Town.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.480
It was our party's greatest
public relations triumph to date.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.520

11:38.960 --> 11:40.160
I'll do my best.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.520
Muammar al-Gaddafi
thanked Erich Honecker for his greetings

11:43.600 --> 11:45.080
and sent him his own.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.400
He praised East German peace policy,

11:48.480 --> 11:53.320
solidarity with Libya
and the struggle of Arab peoples.

when I was asleep,

12:23.840 --> 12:25.800

-Are you sure it's him?
-Gary Banks insists it is.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.880
But at this price, we had better be sure.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.560
(English)  Judging from the way
you looked like when you arrived,

13:04.640 --> 13:06.080
you are lucky to be alive.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.400
Tell me about yourself.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.520
-Is this a job interview?
-Maybe.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.400
I come from East Germany.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
But for the past three years,

13:19.320 --> 13:22.920
I've been working as a German teacher
in an orphanage in Angola.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.920
Yes, and before that?

13:26.560 --> 13:29.600
I was a soldier in the East German army.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.920
A border guard in Berlin.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.240
-That's it?
-More or less.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.520
You know, we are comrades in arms.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.800
Our brotherly leader
is a great admirer of your country.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.800
Like you, we are anti-West, anti-American.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.560
In East Germany we define ourselves
also in terms of what we are for.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.080
Just as you.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.680
State for the people, by the people.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.440
Just imagine if we pooled our resources

14:05.800 --> 14:08.120
to pursue common interests.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.320
Actually my sister lives in East Berlin.
Her husband is the Libyan Ambassador.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.840
-Have you ever been?
-No, no.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.760
She only tells me about crossing over
to the West and shopping

14:20.160 --> 14:23.760

14:25.320 --> 14:27.520
I cannot find it on the map.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.080
Yeah, that's...
because it's a nickname.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.160
On a map it's called Kurfürstendamm.
Should I write it down?

35:50.360 --> 35:51.680

35:54.840 --> 35:56.440

background chatter)

35:58.400 --> 35:59.400
(Gasps)

36:00.280 --> 36:01.800
Nice try, Kolibri.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.440
Khaled, this is where the party's happening.
Come and join us.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.040
Sit.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.920
Who are you really working for?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.840
No one. Yet.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.600
Why don't I trust you?

36:47.880 --> 36:49.480
The truth is like the sun.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.400
You can shut it out for a while
but it ain't goin' away.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.640
Who said that? Engels?

36:57.240 --> 36:58.280
Elvis.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.320
You don't know Elvis?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.560
Elvis? The guy with the slick hair
and white clothes...

37:06.360 --> 37:08.160
and this voice, this...

37:08.240 --> 37:10.680
(Elvis impression)

37:10.760 --> 37:12.120
...No?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.440
Explain this.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.680
I had to know what you two were planning
before I could come in.

37:26.760 --> 37:27.760
What?

37:29.200 --> 37:32.800
You know my history.
You think I work with just anyone?

37:33.160 --> 37:35.680
-You hardly have a choice.
-I always have a choice.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.920
Banks expects a pretty penny
for your services.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.680
Save your money.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.360
(Background chatter)

37:51.160 --> 37:53.000
(Banks bellows)

37:53.760 --> 37:57.520
And this sick trade fair you've set up out
here on the ass of the world, Khaled?

37:58.800 --> 38:01.720
-It's nothing but a toy store.
-I don't follow.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.720
I'm the fucking weapon, Khaled?

38:06.800 --> 38:08.440
Don't you get it?

38:12.800 --> 38:15.560
And now that I know that
you two are professionals...

38:18.320 --> 38:19.840
I'm in.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.920
Oh, isn't this cozy, huh?

38:29.680 --> 38:32.760
I've come to negotiate payment
for my merchandise.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.480
I saved this little fucker's life.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.240
-I own him.
-Come on,

38:37.640 --> 38:38.920
let's have a civilized negotiation
tomorrow morning.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.240
No.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.880
-Yes.
-I want my fucking money now.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.520
-Stop.
-Huh?

38:48.880 --> 38:50.880
Pull yourself together now.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.720

West Berlin, West Germany

39:08.360 --> 39:12.040
We were just kids. Punk friends of ours
had been thrown in jail.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.760
Andi and Steve. We were angry about it.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.840
We wanted to make a statement.
But honestly? We were also drunk.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.800
The whole thing was only half politics.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.840
The other half was youthful stupidity.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.880
It was late after a party.
We spray-painted graffiti

39:28.960 --> 39:31.520
in a new-build neighborhood:
"Free Andi! Free Steve!"

39:31.720 --> 39:33.560
Turn on your radio. Channel 68.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.880
(Dialing through radio channels)

39:38.560 --> 39:40.920
By morning we'd been reported
to the authorities.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.920
By evening we were all in jail.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.760
The punishment was so much crueler
than the crime.

39:45.840 --> 39:49.880
In jail I was interrogated,
isolated, threatened, confused.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.280
I copped to destruction of property
pretty quickly.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.640
Trespassing, too.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.520
But treason?

39:57.160 --> 39:59.080
My crime was just youthful rebellion.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.480
What is youth without rebellion, anyway?

40:01.800 --> 40:03.480
A youth spent in East Germany.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.640

40:30.040 --> 40:33.760
And now, from one of my favorite
East German punk groups, Feeling B.

Shh, we're getting out of here. Come on.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.120

42:05.720 --> 42:07.320
I was in the West.

42:09.480 --> 42:10.480
(sigh)

42:11.640 --> 42:14.200
I wanted to bring my grandson a bear.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.440
In the middle of the night?

42:18.800 --> 42:19.800
Yes.

42:21.360 --> 42:24.720

Martin?

42:47.880 --> 42:49.600
No, what makes you think that?

42:50.760 --> 42:52.600
