THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN (1982)

00:16.029 --> 00:17.997
You sure you know
which ones go where?

00:18.031 --> 00:19.089
I'm sure, Gino.

00:19.132 --> 00:20.497
That's what
you told me yesterday.

00:20.534 --> 00:23.196
I ended up driving 12 anchovies
to a customer's house.

00:23.236 --> 00:24.863
That's 'cause of
your lousy handwriting.

00:24.905 --> 00:26.065
I can't read the address.

00:26.106 --> 00:27.767
You ought to spend
more time in school...

00:27.808 --> 00:29.901
instead of cruisin' around
with broads in my car.

00:29.943 --> 00:31.968
Then you'd learn how to read.

00:32.012 --> 00:33.502
Now come on, hurry up.

00:33.547 --> 00:35.242
And this time
bring the car back.

00:35.282 --> 00:36.909
Gino, you said
I could have it tonight.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.315
What are you tryin' to do,
ruin me?

00:38.352 --> 00:40.115
I ain't in
the rent-a-car business.

00:40.153 --> 00:42.314
Let's go.
The pizzas are gettin' cold.

00:42.356 --> 00:44.347
And don't squish the boxes.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.951
Be careful how you drive!

02:03.136 --> 02:05.104
I'll take a rocky road.

02:05.138 --> 02:06.935
Pink bubble gum, please.

02:06.973 --> 02:08.201
Pink bubble gum?

02:08.241 --> 02:11.210
Yeah, it's the flavor
of the month.

02:20.153 --> 02:21.279
Rocky road.

02:21.321 --> 02:23.016
Oh, thank you.

02:28.628 --> 02:30.255
What do you want?

02:30.297 --> 02:32.162
A rocky road.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.335
She's fine, isn't she?

02:38.371 --> 02:39.895
Yeah, do you know her?

02:39.940 --> 02:42.602
Never saw her before
in my life.

02:47.314 --> 02:49.839
Hey. You know those
three chicks over there?

02:49.883 --> 02:51.077
- Where?
- Right there.

02:51.117 --> 02:53.347
You don't mean
those three alien creatures...

02:53.386 --> 02:54.683
sittin' over there, do you?

02:54.721 --> 02:57.485
David's just telling me
that they're easy lays.

02:57.524 --> 02:59.082
You're imagining easy lays.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.820
I'm not imagining.
Listen, Gary...

03:00.861 --> 03:03.159
Tommy's brother screws
that blonde like he owns her.

03:03.196 --> 03:05.357
Bullshit. Will you look at 'em?
They're virgins.

03:05.398 --> 03:08.060
They're not. I can tell by
the way they walk. Right, Rick?

03:08.101 --> 03:09.728
That brunette ain't no virgin.

03:09.769 --> 03:11.703
Look at the way
she's suckin' on that straw.

03:11.738 --> 03:13.399
I'm wasting my time here.
Count me out.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.603
Hey, cool it for a second, Gary.
This could be interesting.

03:16.643 --> 03:18.508
David, why don't you
walk over there...

03:18.545 --> 03:21.571
and invite the three ladies
back to our table?

03:21.615 --> 03:23.276
No problem.

03:36.930 --> 03:39.296
Hi, girls.
How's it goin' tonight?

03:41.835 --> 03:43.860
Seriously,
will you count me out, Rick?

03:43.904 --> 03:45.599
Hey, do you want
to get laid or not?

03:45.639 --> 03:47.470
I'd rather screw Godzilla
than them.

03:58.018 --> 03:59.815
Do you have the key
to your grandmother's house?

03:59.853 --> 04:03.152
No, but we can go to my house.
My parents went out.

04:03.189 --> 04:04.178
Perfect.

04:04.224 --> 04:06.886
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

04:06.927 --> 04:08.258
Sit down.

04:19.639 --> 04:21.334
I'm Rick.

04:21.374 --> 04:22.773
This is Gary.

04:22.809 --> 04:25.039
You've met the Big Apple.

04:25.078 --> 04:26.705
I'm Millie.

04:26.746 --> 04:28.043
I'm Roxanne.

04:28.081 --> 04:29.241
Hi, I'm Brenda.

04:29.282 --> 04:32.911
Let's not let the party
go on without us, girls.

04:32.953 --> 04:33.942
What party?

04:33.987 --> 04:36.751
The best party in town,
sweetheart.

04:36.790 --> 04:38.223
Tell 'em about it, Gary.

04:41.061 --> 04:43.689
Yeah, it's gonna be great.

04:43.730 --> 04:46.927
There's great music
and people, and...

04:46.967 --> 04:48.730
What about drugs?

04:48.768 --> 04:54.206
Well, we have uppers,
downers...

04:54.240 --> 04:55.605
a little bit of smoke.

04:55.642 --> 04:57.735
All kinds, right guys?

04:57.777 --> 04:59.938
- What about coke?
- Yeah.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.608
- Coke?
- Yeah.

05:02.649 --> 05:04.446
Yeah, lots of coke.

05:04.484 --> 05:06.042
Of course.

05:06.086 --> 05:09.988
Yeah, we have a whole big...
plenty of coke.

05:12.359 --> 05:14.486
Well, what do you say, ladies?

05:14.527 --> 05:15.994
No. I say no.

05:16.029 --> 05:18.224
- Told you they were hot to trot.
- Shut up.

05:18.264 --> 05:20.061
OK.

05:21.935 --> 05:23.459
OK, what's the verdict, girls?

05:24.771 --> 05:28.002
Well, as long as you keep
your hands to yourselves...

05:28.041 --> 05:29.975
and get us home by 12:00.

05:30.010 --> 05:31.375
A quarter till 12:00.

05:31.411 --> 05:33.379
You know I have to be home
at a quarter till 12:00.

05:33.413 --> 05:35.040
You guys fight later.

05:35.081 --> 05:37.242
We have a party
to go to, right?

05:37.283 --> 05:38.875
Yeah!

06:02.075 --> 06:04.066
Step right in, ladies.

06:05.178 --> 06:06.805
Relax, the place is ours.

06:06.846 --> 06:09.212
Gary's parents are out of town.

06:09.249 --> 06:11.410
Everybody
make yourselves at home.

06:17.123 --> 06:19.023
Where is everybody?

06:19.059 --> 06:21.550
- They should be here any minute.
- Yeah, they're on their way.

06:21.594 --> 06:22.891
I don't like this.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.798
Would you like to dance?

06:29.836 --> 06:31.167
OK.

06:36.076 --> 06:38.203
How about you?
Would you like to dance?

06:38.244 --> 06:40.405
Oh, yeah, sure.

06:50.023 --> 06:51.354
Gary.

07:09.309 --> 07:10.936
You know,
you're a great dancer.

07:10.977 --> 07:12.035
Yeah, I know.

07:13.513 --> 07:16.710
- Would you like to dance?
- I really don't care.

07:18.818 --> 07:21.184
Well, you don't care yes...

07:21.221 --> 07:22.813
or you don't care no?

07:22.856 --> 07:24.847
It doesn't make
any difference.

07:29.696 --> 07:32.688
So, what do you say
we dance?

07:34.134 --> 07:35.863
I don't care.

07:42.442 --> 07:45.240
What do you think
about this song?

07:45.278 --> 07:48.611
I really don't care.

07:48.648 --> 07:50.616
What do you care about?

07:50.650 --> 07:53.346
Listen, don't start
that small talk with me.

07:53.386 --> 07:55.320
It's not gonna help you anyway.

07:55.355 --> 07:57.414
You're not gonna get
anything from me.

07:57.457 --> 08:01.120
- Listen, I didn't...
- I really don't care.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.925
Please don't, Rick.

08:05.965 --> 08:07.455
Please.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.660
Stop.

08:10.870 --> 08:12.360
Please stop.

08:22.949 --> 08:23.938
Rick.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.648
- I think maybe we should go.
- No.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.680
We don't even know
where we are.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.157
So...

08:38.198 --> 08:39.688
What about the drugs?

08:42.302 --> 08:44.133
What about the drugs?

08:45.572 --> 08:47.233
What about the drugs?

08:49.008 --> 08:51.067
They're in the kitchen.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.907
They're in the kitchen.

08:52.946 --> 08:54.174
They're in the kitchen.

08:54.214 --> 08:56.648
- They're in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

08:56.683 --> 08:59.447
So you girls sit tight,
and we'll be right back.

08:59.485 --> 09:02.147
You better think
of something quick.

09:02.188 --> 09:04.816
Why the hell did you have
to promise 'em drugs?

09:04.858 --> 09:06.189
Because that's
what they wanted.

09:06.226 --> 09:08.091
You shouldn't have
promised them anything.

09:08.127 --> 09:09.651
If I didn't promise
them something...

09:09.696 --> 09:10.890
they would've
never come, right?

09:10.930 --> 09:12.397
What are we supposed
to do now?

09:12.432 --> 09:15.060
Wait a second.
You got any Sweet'N Low?

09:19.339 --> 09:22.502
Here we are, girls.
The best stuff in town.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.169
Yeah, fresh from Peru.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.474
And crispy chips.

09:26.512 --> 09:29.174
One hit, and you'll be flyin'.

09:42.762 --> 09:45.595
Really good stuff!

09:45.632 --> 09:47.224
Great.

09:57.844 --> 09:59.209
I love it.

10:29.008 --> 10:32.034
This is the best Colombian
I've ever had.

10:32.078 --> 10:34.842
- Want another line?
- You mean, like, now?

10:34.881 --> 10:35.848
Yeah.

10:35.882 --> 10:38.646
- No, no.
- No, thanks a lot.

10:38.685 --> 10:39.743
Good stuff, huh?

10:39.786 --> 10:40.912
Yeah.

10:59.973 --> 11:03.101
Hey, Brenda. Can I talk to you
inside for a second?

11:03.142 --> 11:05.508
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.474
Gee, it's sort of dark in here.

11:11.517 --> 11:14.213
Yeah, I guess the bulb
kinda burnt itself out.

11:14.253 --> 11:16.244
Sit down.

11:18.257 --> 11:21.124
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

11:21.160 --> 11:22.354
You know.

11:22.395 --> 11:23.794
I know what?

11:23.830 --> 11:25.457
You know.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.193
You sorta like me, huh?

11:27.233 --> 11:28.393
Yeah.

11:31.304 --> 11:33.534
You got white stuff
all over your nose.

11:33.573 --> 11:35.803
- So do you.
- I do.

11:37.110 --> 11:39.601
This coke is kinda sweet.

11:39.645 --> 11:41.704
It's really good stuff.

11:41.748 --> 11:43.545
Yeah, the best.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.710
David, what are you doing?!

11:48.287 --> 11:50.448
Excuse me.

12:03.369 --> 12:05.360
Let's take our business
elsewhere.

12:05.405 --> 12:06.702
OK.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.808
Now, you two have fun.

12:31.864 --> 12:33.058
Do you want a chip?

12:33.099 --> 12:34.430
Thank you.

12:53.953 --> 12:55.784
David, please don't.

12:55.822 --> 12:58.154
Look, I don't wanna
take my blouse off.

12:58.191 --> 12:59.783
I just met you tonight.

12:59.826 --> 13:01.726
But what about
Roxanne and Millie?

13:01.761 --> 13:03.058
What about them?

13:03.096 --> 13:05.257
They don't seem
to be having any problems.

13:16.909 --> 13:18.968
But I'm not on the pill.

13:19.011 --> 13:20.342
Me, neither.

13:39.132 --> 13:40.827
The patio?

13:40.867 --> 13:44.860
Yeah, go out on the patio
and count to 100...

13:44.904 --> 13:48.601
and when you're finished,
I'll be already undressed.

13:49.876 --> 13:51.605
Undressed?

13:51.644 --> 13:53.805
In bed.

13:53.846 --> 13:55.404
You sure?

13:55.448 --> 13:57.507
I'm sure.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.745
I'll be on the patio.

13:59.785 --> 14:01.116
OK.

14:03.789 --> 14:05.586
I'll be countin'.

14:08.327 --> 14:10.761
One, two, three...

14:10.796 --> 14:13.196
four, five, six...

14:13.232 --> 14:15.826
seven, eight, nine...

14:15.868 --> 14:18.302
ten, eleven, twelve...

14:18.337 --> 14:20.703
thirteen, fourteen...

14:37.890 --> 14:40.256
- Would you like a chip?
- What?

14:40.293 --> 14:42.352
A chip... would you like one?

14:42.395 --> 14:44.056
No, thanks.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.426
It really was.
You were wonderful.

15:20.466 --> 15:22.525
Gary, are you home?

15:22.568 --> 15:25.093
What the hell
is going on here?

15:25.137 --> 15:28.766
Hal, I think your son should
explain what's going on here.

15:28.808 --> 15:31.038
Gary, what the hell
is going on here?

15:31.077 --> 15:32.271
Millie?

15:34.046 --> 15:36.310
I'd like you
to meet my parents.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.682
Pop...

15:39.719 --> 15:41.016
Millie.

15:41.053 --> 15:42.315
Hi.

15:42.355 --> 15:43.379
Hi.

15:45.124 --> 15:48.787
Oh, my God!
I'm having a heart attack!

15:50.396 --> 15:53.388
Hal! Just don't stand there!

15:53.432 --> 15:55.593
I want these tramps
out of here!

15:55.635 --> 15:56.761
Gary, get them out of here.

15:56.802 --> 15:59.202
Millie, can I borrow
your breath spray?

15:59.238 --> 16:01.138
I'm dying!

16:02.608 --> 16:03.973
I'm dying.

16:08.814 --> 16:10.281
Hurry up!

16:12.251 --> 16:14.116
All right. Where to now?

16:14.153 --> 16:15.780
I think we should
just call it a night.

16:15.821 --> 16:17.652
No, come on,
let's go to the beach!

16:17.690 --> 16:19.749
Wait a minute. Where's David?

16:19.792 --> 16:21.760
This is terrible.

16:21.794 --> 16:23.762
I want you to lay down.

16:23.796 --> 16:26.697
- Lay down and rest.
- All right. I will.

16:26.732 --> 16:30.259
Please just do me a favor.
Just please go...

16:30.303 --> 16:34.672
and get me two aspirin
and some water, please.

16:34.707 --> 16:36.607
And then close the door.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.178
Oh, what a mess.

16:40.212 --> 16:42.976
96, 97, 98...

16:43.015 --> 16:45.540
99, 100.

17:06.705 --> 17:08.640
Not now, Hal.

17:08.674 --> 17:10.335
Hal?

17:10.376 --> 17:12.435
Mrs. Spencer,
what are you doing here?

17:12.478 --> 17:14.570
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?!

17:14.613 --> 17:16.478
Oh, Hal!

17:16.515 --> 17:19.608
I brought you a couple of...

17:19.652 --> 17:21.050
Mr. Spencer!

17:21.087 --> 17:22.554
What the hell
is going on here?!

17:22.588 --> 17:25.352
You don't understand.
She told me to go outside, and...

17:25.391 --> 17:27.483
I did not!
He tried to rape me!

17:27.526 --> 17:28.788
- Rape?!
- No! No!

17:28.828 --> 17:31.058
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

17:34.533 --> 17:38.629
You pervert!
Get out of my house!

17:38.671 --> 17:40.036
Shame on you!

17:40.072 --> 17:42.165
Here he comes!

17:42.208 --> 17:43.334
David!

17:43.376 --> 17:44.843
Come on, David!

17:44.877 --> 17:47.004
You're in your
fucking underwear!

17:49.281 --> 17:51.579
- Hey, guys, you know something?
- What?

17:51.617 --> 17:53.107
Your parents are home.

18:51.410 --> 18:52.934
Victor!

18:52.978 --> 18:54.809
What are you doin', Victor?

18:54.847 --> 18:59.147
Looks like we've got ourselves
a peeping tom, guys!

18:59.185 --> 19:01.210
I wasn't peeping.

19:01.253 --> 19:02.880
I was just...

19:02.922 --> 19:04.412
I was just looking
at the board.

19:04.457 --> 19:07.017
Sure.

19:07.059 --> 19:09.289
Victor's got himself
a hard-on.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.496
What are you hiding, Victor?

19:13.532 --> 19:14.760
It's none of your business.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.358
Buzz off, blimp.

19:16.402 --> 19:19.166
OK, OK, come on, guys.
Let's lay off him.

19:19.205 --> 19:21.833
I mean, it's too small
to see, anyway, right?

19:21.874 --> 19:25.867
Oh, yeah? I just bet you guys
wish you had what I have.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.145
Bullshit, Victor.

19:30.182 --> 19:32.844
Put your money
where your mouth is.

19:32.885 --> 19:34.182
Money? Now he's talkin'.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.984
All right, listen up, guys.
Everybody put in a buck...

19:37.022 --> 19:39.217
and the man who's got
the biggest tool...

19:39.258 --> 19:41.590
he's the one
who wins the pool.

19:54.139 --> 19:55.663
3 and 1/2.

19:59.178 --> 20:01.203
Rick is here!

20:07.286 --> 20:09.345
Holy shit.

20:09.388 --> 20:10.446
It's alive!

20:11.590 --> 20:13.285
Jesus Christ.

20:15.861 --> 20:17.226
That's nine inches.

20:17.263 --> 20:19.322
Nine? Who are you
trying to cheat?

20:19.365 --> 20:21.299
It's 9 and 1/2.
Measure it again.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.198
We're not including
your balls, Victor.

20:23.235 --> 20:26.864
Neither am I. Look, it's mine.
I should know what it is.

20:26.906 --> 20:28.897
OK, you want to give him
the extra 1/2 inch?

20:28.941 --> 20:30.875
9 and 1/2 for Victor!

20:40.819 --> 20:42.787
One, two, three, four.

20:42.821 --> 20:44.550
Thank you.

20:48.594 --> 20:50.459
- Hey, Gary.
- Hi.

20:53.232 --> 20:54.859
Don't strain your eyeballs.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.800
Hey, you know who she is?

20:56.835 --> 20:58.097
Which one?

20:58.137 --> 20:59.798
The one with the purple streak
in her hair?

20:59.838 --> 21:01.533
No, the other one, turkey.

21:01.574 --> 21:04.236
- I think her name is Karen.
- Karen what?

21:04.276 --> 21:07.404
I don't know. She just
moved here about a week ago.

21:07.446 --> 21:09.573
Can you find out
where she lives?

21:09.615 --> 21:11.242
Sure, no sweat.

21:11.283 --> 21:14.446
For a small fee,
I think I can find out.

22:29.728 --> 22:31.855
- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

22:31.897 --> 22:33.694
Is something wrong?

22:33.732 --> 22:35.256
I'm not sure.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.097
Well, let me have a look.

22:42.408 --> 22:44.273
Looks like you have a flat.

22:44.309 --> 22:45.776
Can it be fixed?

22:45.811 --> 22:47.039
I don't know.

22:47.079 --> 22:49.604
You must have run over
some small glass or something.

22:49.648 --> 22:52.310
- Do you have a pump?
- No.

22:52.351 --> 22:54.512
Oh, darn, I'm gonna
be late for school.

22:54.553 --> 22:57.386
- Can I give you a lift?
- Which way are you going?

22:57.423 --> 22:59.550
- To Roosevelt High.
- So am I!

22:59.591 --> 23:02.219
- So be my guest.
- OK.

23:06.765 --> 23:08.824
Can I offer you some pizza?

23:08.867 --> 23:10.300
No, thank you.

23:10.335 --> 23:12.064
How about a big
meatball sandwich?

23:12.104 --> 23:14.732
No, thanks.
I just had breakfast.

23:14.773 --> 23:16.502
What's your name?

23:16.542 --> 23:17.839
Karen.

23:17.876 --> 23:19.707
- Sharon?
- Karen.

23:19.745 --> 23:21.576
Marion?

23:21.613 --> 23:22.978
Karen... with a ''K. ''

23:23.015 --> 23:25.540
Oh, ''Karen. ''
Why didn't you say so?

23:25.584 --> 23:26.642
I just did.

23:33.559 --> 23:35.288
Thanks for the ride.

23:38.230 --> 23:39.390
Bye.

23:42.301 --> 23:44.292
Karen! Hold on a second.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.907
I wanted to ask what
you were doing tonight.

23:50.943 --> 23:52.535
I'm afraid I'm busy.

23:52.578 --> 23:54.808
Oh. That's too bad.

23:54.847 --> 23:58.010
Because I know about this
really happening party tonight.

23:58.050 --> 24:01.281
Sorry. There's always
a next time.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.753
Thanks again, Gary.

24:04.256 --> 24:05.382
Karen!

24:06.892 --> 24:09.019
Let me ask you
something straight out.

24:09.061 --> 24:11.120
Go ahead.

24:14.099 --> 24:16.590
Do you have a boyfriend?

24:16.635 --> 24:17.897
No.

24:17.936 --> 24:19.062
Well...

24:19.104 --> 24:21.095
Thanks again, Gary.

24:23.509 --> 24:24.737
Come on, move!

24:24.777 --> 24:26.972
That's it, get that lead
out of your ass.

24:27.012 --> 24:28.240
One, two, three!

24:33.919 --> 24:35.409
Hey, shake it.

24:55.674 --> 24:57.141
Hey, Big Apple,
what's going on?

24:57.176 --> 24:59.974
- Gary, where have you been?
- My parents. Don't ask.

25:00.012 --> 25:02.207
Don't worry about it.
You came at the perfect time.

25:02.247 --> 25:04.078
The place is really jumping.

25:04.116 --> 25:05.549
Hey, give me a cigarette.

25:05.584 --> 25:08.485
- Come on, I only have nine left.
- Put it on my bill.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.715
Jesus Christ.
You know, you guys.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.690
Hey, Gary, guess who's here?

25:12.724 --> 25:14.885
- Who?
- Karen.

25:14.927 --> 25:16.918
She's right over there
dancing with Rick.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.499
It doesn't take old lover boy
very long, does it?

25:24.536 --> 25:26.470
He's on her like flies to shit.

25:36.849 --> 25:39.818
Come on, you might as well
just forget about her.

25:39.852 --> 25:42.719
Maybe he'll give you
sloppy seconds.

25:54.299 --> 25:55.926
My pleasure, madam.

25:55.968 --> 25:57.595
Oh, mine, too.

25:57.636 --> 26:01.197
I want you to meet
my two very best friends.

26:01.306 --> 26:03.706
Gary, David,
how you guys doing?

26:03.742 --> 26:07.007
Listen, I want you to meet
the love of my life.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.738
Gary, this is...

26:09.781 --> 26:11.715
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi, Gary.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.218
So you two have met before?

26:14.253 --> 26:17.051
Yeah, I guess
you can say that.

26:17.089 --> 26:19.057
Karen, hi, there you are.

26:19.091 --> 26:20.888
I've been looking
for you all night.

26:20.926 --> 26:22.393
Oh, hi, Rose.

26:22.427 --> 26:24.258
Rose, this is Rick.

26:25.597 --> 26:28.896
And this is Gary.

26:28.934 --> 26:30.424
Hi, Gary.

26:30.469 --> 26:32.801
Oh. Hi, Rose.

26:32.838 --> 26:34.897
All right,
let's cut this shit...

26:34.940 --> 26:37.602
and now let's all get serious.

26:39.478 --> 26:41.105
May I have this dance,
princess?

26:41.146 --> 26:42.272
Sure.

27:12.077 --> 27:14.204
Would you like to dance, Gary?

27:14.246 --> 27:15.713
Let's dance.

27:15.747 --> 27:17.044
Rose, I don't know...

27:17.082 --> 27:18.743
Come on, dance with me.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.458
You and Rose
are pretty tight, huh?

27:27.492 --> 27:29.892
I guess. Why?

27:29.928 --> 27:33.386
It looks like she's a little bit
more than hot for Gary.

27:33.432 --> 27:35.992
I think it would be great
if they hit it off.

27:36.034 --> 27:37.592
Have we done that?

27:37.636 --> 27:39.831
Done what?

27:39.871 --> 27:41.930
Hit it off.

27:54.019 --> 27:56.749
I really love this song.

27:56.788 --> 28:00.884
This song just drives me crazy.

28:00.926 --> 28:03.622
Yeah, it's great.

28:03.662 --> 28:05.630
Will you excuse me
for one minute?

28:05.664 --> 28:06.722
Sure.

28:14.740 --> 28:17.402
Excuse me.
I'll be back in a minute.

28:19.044 --> 28:20.204
May I?

28:20.245 --> 28:21.610
Cool.

28:21.646 --> 28:23.580
Looking real foxy tonight.

28:36.628 --> 28:40.325
What's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?

28:40.365 --> 28:43.528
Not yet.
I'm just getting started.

28:43.568 --> 28:45.900
Well, seems like you're off
to a pretty good start.

28:45.937 --> 28:47.404
The night's still young.

28:47.439 --> 28:50.203
I'm just getting ready
for the good part.

28:50.242 --> 28:52.904
Hey, do you want some?

28:52.944 --> 28:54.935
Oh, no thanks. I'll pass.

28:57.282 --> 29:00.774
How's about a big
meatball sandwich, huh?

29:03.722 --> 29:06.850
You and Rick are
pretty good friends, aren't you?

29:06.892 --> 29:11.192
Yeah. We're partners,
you know? Tight.

29:11.229 --> 29:14.687
You sure like him, don't you?

29:14.733 --> 29:16.462
Why do you ask?

29:16.501 --> 29:19.902
I don't know.
I just felt like asking.

29:19.938 --> 29:24.204
Hey, there you are,
my beautiful baby.

29:24.242 --> 29:26.574
I was looking all over for you.

29:26.611 --> 29:29.205
Well, I was just
talking to Gary.

29:29.247 --> 29:33.377
Gary. I think you better
lighten up on that stuff, man.

29:33.418 --> 29:35.249
It'll turn your brain to shit.

30:07.252 --> 30:09.550
Hey, man, take it easy!

30:09.588 --> 30:12.022
Watch it, jerk!

30:12.057 --> 30:13.217
Gary.

30:13.258 --> 30:15.123
Hey, you're
fucking wrecked, man.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.821
Get it together.

30:16.862 --> 30:19.092
David, will you
take care of him, please?

30:19.131 --> 30:20.325
We got a freak-out
on our hands.

30:20.365 --> 30:23.300
Come on, Gary, it's me... David.

30:24.970 --> 30:27.803
What's the matter
with you, man?

30:27.839 --> 30:29.602
Hi, David.

30:29.641 --> 30:31.768
You're ruining it
for everybody.

30:31.810 --> 30:34.176
Come on, let's take him
out by the pool.

30:34.212 --> 30:36.510
No, I don't want to go.

30:36.548 --> 30:39.016
No, I don't want to go.

30:46.525 --> 30:50.655
Listen, I want you to go home,
get a good night's sleep...

30:50.695 --> 30:52.856
and in the morning
you'll feel 100%% % better.

30:52.898 --> 30:54.297
Thanks, pal.

30:54.332 --> 30:56.960
Look, you go on.
Go on. I'll be all right.

30:57.002 --> 31:00.062
Are you sure you don't want me
to drive you home?

31:00.105 --> 31:03.905
You're gonna get my seats wet,
and my boss is gonna kill me.

31:03.942 --> 31:06.240
Get in the car, come on.

31:06.278 --> 31:08.371
- David?
- What?

31:08.413 --> 31:10.381
Are you going back
to the party?

31:10.415 --> 31:12.747
Of course, what do you think?

31:12.784 --> 31:15.252
Give her my best, will you?

31:15.287 --> 31:16.584
To who?

31:16.621 --> 31:18.748
To her... Karen.

31:18.790 --> 31:21.918
Oh, Karen, of course.
Yeah. Come on, get in.

31:21.960 --> 31:26.260
David, make sure to tell her
I love her madly.

31:26.298 --> 31:30.325
OK, I'll tell her your love
for her is highly spiritual.

31:30.368 --> 31:32.302
OK? Now come on.

31:32.337 --> 31:33.804
Thanks.

31:33.838 --> 31:35.066
No problem.

31:35.106 --> 31:36.573
Don't forget.

31:36.608 --> 31:37.597
I won't.

31:37.642 --> 31:38.973
Just be careful, all right?

31:44.783 --> 31:46.478
Gary?

31:46.518 --> 31:47.917
Yeah?

31:47.953 --> 31:49.147
Why don't you come in...

31:49.187 --> 31:51.212
and introduce yourself
to our guests?

31:51.256 --> 31:52.348
OK.

31:52.390 --> 31:54.585
You'll never get over
how much he's grown...

31:54.626 --> 31:57.026
since the last time
you've seen him.

31:57.062 --> 31:58.222
Hi, everybody!

31:58.263 --> 32:00.390
Gary!

32:00.432 --> 32:06.462
Oh, my goodness, Martha,
how this young man has grown!

32:06.504 --> 32:09.496
Are you in high school
already, Gary?

32:13.278 --> 32:18.079
Gary, Mrs. Roswell
is asking you a question.

32:19.484 --> 32:22.885
Oh, I am so sorry.

32:22.921 --> 32:25.219
He hasn't been
feeling well lately.

32:25.257 --> 32:29.853
What this young man needs
is a long, cold shower.

32:29.894 --> 32:31.259
Oh, yeah?

32:31.296 --> 32:33.696
Only if you join me, baby.

32:33.732 --> 32:36.633
'Cause I know what you need.

32:37.869 --> 32:39.268
Good night, Gary.

32:39.304 --> 32:42.205
Gary, I want you to take this
tray back into the kitchen...

32:42.240 --> 32:44.105
and then go to your room!

32:44.142 --> 32:45.769
Good night, Gary.

32:45.810 --> 32:48.244
Good night, everybody!

32:48.280 --> 32:50.305
Good night, Gary!

32:57.222 --> 33:00.214
Good night, Mrs. Roswell.

33:00.258 --> 33:02.590
Good night, Gary.

33:02.627 --> 33:06.063
Good night, My Mrs. Roswell

33:06.097 --> 33:09.396
Good night, my love

33:09.434 --> 33:13.632
Sleep tight, my Mrs. Roswell

33:13.672 --> 33:16.300
Sleep tight, my love

33:16.341 --> 33:17.933
Good night

33:19.177 --> 33:20.906
No, please, nobody get up.

33:20.945 --> 33:22.674
We'll clean it up
in the morning.

33:22.881 --> 33:26.248
An isosceles is a triangle
which has two equal sides.

33:26.284 --> 33:29.185
A scalene is a triangle
with no equal sides...

33:29.220 --> 33:30.847
like so.

33:30.889 --> 33:34.450
We have A, B, C.

33:34.492 --> 33:39.156
Now, let's review
yesterday's problem on page 74.

33:39.197 --> 33:41.757
What did we say about
the relationship...

33:41.800 --> 33:46.328
between two squares
bisected by lines...

33:46.371 --> 33:49.101
both horizontal and vertical?

33:49.140 --> 33:50.835
Gary?

33:52.377 --> 33:53.366
Gary!

33:55.647 --> 33:57.114
Yes?

33:57.148 --> 33:59.776
Gary, please stand up
and illustrate the theory.

34:05.757 --> 34:07.019
Well...

34:07.058 --> 34:08.547
Gary, please answer.

34:08.592 --> 34:10.389
See, it's really very simple.

34:10.428 --> 34:11.656
You...

34:11.696 --> 34:13.721
Take the side that's longest.

34:13.764 --> 34:15.733
You take the side
that's longest.

34:15.766 --> 34:18.463
- And then...
- And what?

34:18.503 --> 34:20.266
And then you...

34:22.974 --> 34:25.340
And then BC.

34:25.377 --> 34:26.742
And then BC...

34:26.777 --> 34:28.712
you know, the lines cross.

34:28.746 --> 34:30.408
And then?

34:30.447 --> 34:33.349
And then you... sorry.

34:33.385 --> 34:36.980
- And then?
- And then...

34:37.021 --> 34:39.251
and then...

34:39.290 --> 34:40.757
and then...

34:42.827 --> 34:45.159
And then you shove it
up your ass.

35:15.727 --> 35:18.787
Un momentita... I'm coming.

35:20.765 --> 35:22.096
Pizza delivery.

35:22.133 --> 35:23.930
Ah, my pizza.

35:23.968 --> 35:25.833
Come on in, chico.

35:31.576 --> 35:36.775
Carmela is pleased to see
such a beautiful delivery.

35:38.316 --> 35:41.581
Where should I put these?

35:41.619 --> 35:44.383
Why don't you put the pizza
in the kitchen.

35:44.422 --> 35:45.719
Over there?

35:45.757 --> 35:48.658
And put the bottles
in the fridge.

35:48.693 --> 35:49.682
OK.

35:51.029 --> 35:53.623
How much do you charge,
my little pizza boy?

35:53.665 --> 35:55.963
It's $7.50 for the pizza...

35:56.000 --> 35:59.458
and $1.50 for the drinks.

35:59.504 --> 36:01.233
It's nine bucks.

36:02.340 --> 36:05.207
Jesus, lady, I'm s...

36:05.243 --> 36:07.609
I'm sorry. It slipped.

36:08.947 --> 36:10.471
Here, let me clean it up.

36:10.515 --> 36:13.006
Don't worry, it's nothing.

36:13.051 --> 36:15.815
Could've happened to anyone.

36:21.626 --> 36:25.153
Taste it. It's good?

36:28.066 --> 36:31.763
It's papaya. Don't you like it?

36:31.803 --> 36:33.236
I do.

36:33.271 --> 36:37.105
It's very good, ma'am.

36:37.141 --> 36:39.837
You can call me Carmela.

36:41.279 --> 36:44.737
Don't worry,
Carmela does not bite...

36:44.782 --> 36:47.444
nice, young muchachos.

36:47.485 --> 36:51.717
That's my boss. I gotta go.
I have to go call him.

36:51.756 --> 36:54.725
You must come back
when you have more time.

36:54.759 --> 36:56.351
Hey, the money!

36:56.394 --> 36:58.954
Hey, that's OK. So long!

36:58.997 --> 37:01.727
Come back whenever you like!

37:42.941 --> 37:46.468
Oh, it's my little muchacho.

37:46.511 --> 37:48.240
Back so soon.

37:48.279 --> 37:51.248
Hi. Me and my friends...

37:51.282 --> 37:53.079
we just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

37:53.117 --> 37:55.278
And I thought we'd bring you
some extra pizzas.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.881
Oh, you're friends
of my muchacho?

37:58.923 --> 38:01.118
Good, good,
we have a pizza party.

38:01.159 --> 38:02.421
Come in.

38:08.099 --> 38:10.033
Yeah, go.

38:24.949 --> 38:27.645
Don't be shy, muchachos.

38:27.685 --> 38:29.744
Please sit down.

38:33.124 --> 38:36.651
Now I will get you
a little drinkito.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.432
Sit down.

38:44.469 --> 38:47.097
You weren't bullshitting.
She is totally hot!

38:47.138 --> 38:48.765
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:48.806 --> 38:50.774
You sure this isn't
going to cost us?

38:50.808 --> 38:54.767
I'm positive.
She does it 'cause she loves it.

38:57.148 --> 38:59.616
If I had known
you were coming...

38:59.651 --> 39:03.519
I would have had
everything just right.

39:03.554 --> 39:07.388
Lucky for us my darling
sailor boy Paco...

39:07.425 --> 39:09.723
left me this bottle of tequila.

39:21.572 --> 39:22.800
Amor.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.034
Amor?

39:24.075 --> 39:25.906
To love.

39:37.388 --> 39:39.754
Let's have some music.

39:48.599 --> 39:50.533
Go ahead,
she's waiting for you.

39:50.568 --> 39:52.866
You go.
You're her little muchacho.

39:52.904 --> 39:55.372
Cut the shit. You saw the way
she was looking at you.

39:55.406 --> 39:56.668
Now, go!

41:18.089 --> 41:20.057
Come...

41:20.091 --> 41:22.116
and dance with Carmela.

42:24.288 --> 42:26.279
Get your clothes off.

42:28.793 --> 42:29.987
What are you doing?

42:30.027 --> 42:32.689
Come on, he said
to take our clothes off.

42:38.536 --> 42:41.130
Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí.

43:04.262 --> 43:06.230
Move... let me have a look.

43:06.264 --> 43:08.528
Come on, I gotta look.

43:08.566 --> 43:12.730
Oh, you are so long,
my sweet papaya.

43:12.770 --> 43:17.400
You are driving Carmela crazy!

43:17.441 --> 43:21.070
- Come on, I gotta see!
- Shut up! Shut up!

43:21.112 --> 43:22.909
- Oh, God.
- What?

43:22.947 --> 43:24.209
I don't believe this.

43:24.248 --> 43:28.446
More! More!
That's it! Harder!

43:28.486 --> 43:30.784
Yes! Yes!

43:30.821 --> 43:32.254
More! More!

43:32.290 --> 43:34.383
Gary, I can't stand it.
I gotta look.

43:34.425 --> 43:35.449
Wait, no.

43:38.429 --> 43:40.260
Mama! Mama!

43:40.298 --> 43:41.458
Papa!

43:44.635 --> 43:46.535
My angel.

43:46.570 --> 43:49.095
I am ready! I am ready!

43:49.140 --> 43:51.267
Jesus Christ, he's fucking her.

43:51.309 --> 43:53.106
He's fucking her!

43:53.144 --> 43:54.975
They're finished.
Here he comes.

43:58.582 --> 44:03.212
Who is the next muchacho
for Carmela?

44:03.254 --> 44:05.484
Go to it, Gary.
She's waiting for you, man.

44:05.523 --> 44:06.547
David's next.

44:06.590 --> 44:08.717
No, you said
you wanted seconds.

44:08.759 --> 44:11.284
Come on, David, you said
you were going after Rick.

44:11.329 --> 44:12.728
Now, go ahead.

44:12.763 --> 44:14.958
I am starting to feel Ionely.

44:14.999 --> 44:17.991
- Rick, I'll tell you why...
- Get in there.

44:20.604 --> 44:22.902
Rick, tell me, how was it?

44:22.940 --> 44:25.170
It was great, man.

44:25.209 --> 44:27.143
Hi.

44:27.178 --> 44:30.306
Come to me, my big burrito.

44:30.348 --> 44:31.747
Me?

44:31.782 --> 44:33.773
You are the only man I see.

44:33.818 --> 44:34.978
You sure?

44:35.019 --> 44:38.955
Oh, yes. Come to Carmela.

44:38.990 --> 44:41.015
Hurry up. Come on.

44:41.058 --> 44:43.253
Hurry up.

44:43.294 --> 44:48.095
Carmela wants to feel you.

44:49.467 --> 44:53.028
Carmela wants you to feel good.

44:59.777 --> 45:01.210
Take this off.

45:01.312 --> 45:02.711
What?

45:02.747 --> 45:04.180
Take it off.

45:06.884 --> 45:08.044
Don't be shy.

45:09.587 --> 45:11.145
That's it.

45:13.257 --> 45:14.690
Bueno.

45:19.597 --> 45:21.827
She's going for it.
She's totally going for it.

45:21.866 --> 45:23.959
Let me see.

45:51.062 --> 45:52.324
Here she comes!

45:54.065 --> 45:56.761
Intermission.

45:56.801 --> 46:01.204
I just love a good fiesta.

46:01.305 --> 46:03.330
Let's have some more music.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.509
Who is it?

46:13.584 --> 46:15.609
- Paco!
- Carmela.

46:15.653 --> 46:16.847
Oh, shit!

46:16.887 --> 46:19.014
Hurry! Get your clothes on.

46:19.056 --> 46:20.614
Mi amor.

46:20.658 --> 46:23.024
- Mi corazón.
- Hi!

46:23.060 --> 46:24.687
Mi vida.

46:24.728 --> 46:27.322
Get your shirt on!
Come on, man!

46:28.899 --> 46:31.424
This is my sailor Paco.

46:31.469 --> 46:34.302
He's arriving from Puerto Rico
to visit Carmela.

46:34.338 --> 46:36.238
Isn't he good?

46:36.273 --> 46:38.901
These are my neighbor boys
from downstairs.

46:38.943 --> 46:41.935
I was helping them
with their Spanish lessons.

46:41.979 --> 46:45.107
That is all for today, boys.
You can go now.

46:45.149 --> 46:46.480
Adiós, muchachos.

46:48.652 --> 46:49.983
What a nympho.

46:58.162 --> 47:00.130
David's still inside!

47:00.164 --> 47:02.394
David, come on! Hurry up!

47:04.235 --> 47:05.793
Shit, my clothes!

47:07.805 --> 47:09.102
Come on, David!

47:09.140 --> 47:10.607
Come on,
you're not gonna make it!

47:10.641 --> 47:12.074
Come on, man, hurry up!

47:12.109 --> 47:13.269
Shit!

47:26.457 --> 47:27.788
Come back here!

47:30.127 --> 47:31.059
Come back!

47:36.200 --> 47:37.360
Hey, Rick.

47:37.401 --> 47:39.096
Hi, what's happening?

47:39.136 --> 47:40.660
Where's the car?

47:40.704 --> 47:44.868
I couldn't get it tonight.
My boss wouldn't let me have it.

47:44.909 --> 47:46.877
Are you serious?
Gary, you're crazy, man.

47:46.911 --> 47:48.811
Karen and Rose
are gonna be here any second.

47:48.846 --> 47:50.973
I told you to count me out
in the first place.

47:51.015 --> 47:54.212
You're supposed to be my buddy,
help me out tonight, remember?

47:54.251 --> 47:55.980
And you know that Karen
won't hang out with me...

47:56.020 --> 47:57.385
unless Rose comes along.

47:57.421 --> 47:59.412
Besides, she's got
the hots for you, man.

47:59.456 --> 48:01.924
Oh, gee. Thanks a lot.

48:06.363 --> 48:08.263
Hey, guys. How's it goin'?

48:08.299 --> 48:11.564
- It's not so great, Victor.
- What's the problem?

48:14.305 --> 48:16.603
Well, you see, Victor,
Gary and I...

48:16.640 --> 48:20.906
we invited these three
real hot blondes here tonight.

48:20.945 --> 48:24.847
But the thing is,
we got the rum...

48:24.882 --> 48:27.248
we got the chicks...

48:27.284 --> 48:29.184
but there's only two of us.

48:29.220 --> 48:30.482
We need another guy.

48:30.521 --> 48:33.354
Hey, I'll give you a hand.

48:33.390 --> 48:35.688
Aw, no, Victor, really.

48:35.726 --> 48:37.591
No, no, no. No problem.

48:37.628 --> 48:38.788
Look, Victor, no.

48:38.829 --> 48:40.490
If there's any problem at all.

48:40.531 --> 48:41.828
We don't want
to inconvenience you.

48:41.865 --> 48:45.062
Hey, no, it's no inconvenience.
I'd like to.

48:45.102 --> 48:49.232
I mean,
what are friends for, right?

48:49.273 --> 48:52.538
Right. Now, Victor,
I'll park your car...

48:52.576 --> 48:55.443
and you go inside and get
some coke for the rum, OK?

48:56.880 --> 48:58.643
Well...

48:58.682 --> 49:01.674
Come on, what do you say?
Look, it's gettin' late.

49:01.719 --> 49:04.187
Yeah, I don't know.

49:04.221 --> 49:05.415
Well...

49:07.224 --> 49:09.556
OK. All right.

49:09.593 --> 49:11.891
But you guys, really...

49:11.929 --> 49:14.056
park this beauty gently.

49:14.098 --> 49:16.430
- Oh, we will, Victor.
- I just got her painted.

49:16.467 --> 49:17.593
Looks great.

49:17.635 --> 49:19.535
Yeah, it cost me my last buck.

49:19.570 --> 49:21.936
And be careful
with your cigarette.

49:21.972 --> 49:23.963
- No problem.
- Oh, good.

49:25.376 --> 49:26.570
Three blondes?

49:26.610 --> 49:28.441
Three!

49:28.479 --> 49:31.141
Great.

49:31.181 --> 49:32.671
Great.

49:44.228 --> 49:46.059
- Get in the back.
- No way.

49:46.096 --> 49:47.427
Hey, how you doing?

49:47.464 --> 49:48.556
Hi, Gary.

49:52.403 --> 49:54.303
All right.

49:54.338 --> 49:56.431
So, what do you guys
want to to do tonight?

49:56.473 --> 49:57.701
I don't know.

49:57.741 --> 50:00.471
- Why don't we go to the point?
- Hey, that's a great idea!

50:00.511 --> 50:03.605
Oh, God! I've never been
to the point before.

50:03.647 --> 50:06.639
That sounds like
a lot of fun! Yeah!

50:21.799 --> 50:24.768
Rose, do you have any mints
or gum or something?

50:24.802 --> 50:27.066
I only have two pieces left...

50:27.104 --> 50:29.197
and that has to last me
all night.

50:29.239 --> 50:33.767
Rose, how'd you like to sit
up front with Gary?

50:33.811 --> 50:35.642
Sure.

52:03.867 --> 52:05.858
Assholes.

52:09.273 --> 52:10.740
Gary, wait up!

52:10.774 --> 52:13.208
I'll see you in a couple.

52:14.711 --> 52:17.839
Listen, Gary, I gotta
ask you a small favor.

52:17.881 --> 52:19.974
Can you lend me the key
to your grandmother's tonight?

52:20.017 --> 52:21.109
What for?

52:21.151 --> 52:24.120
I got a date with Karen,
and I want to be alone.

52:24.154 --> 52:25.883
Yeah, well, I don't...

52:25.923 --> 52:29.518
Listen, Gary.
This is really important to me.

52:29.560 --> 52:32.927
Tonight could really be
the big night, you know?

52:32.963 --> 52:34.260
Yeah.

52:34.298 --> 52:36.266
OK, I'll give you
the key tonight.

52:36.300 --> 52:39.792
All right! Thanks a lot, man.
I owe you one, OK?

52:52.316 --> 52:53.715
Here he comes.

52:54.952 --> 52:56.419
Hey, what's shakin', guys?

52:56.453 --> 52:57.750
How's it goin', Rick?

52:57.788 --> 52:59.255
Hi, what's happening?

52:59.289 --> 53:01.780
You know what's happening.
Let me have it.

53:01.825 --> 53:02.985
Let you have what?

53:03.026 --> 53:04.789
What do you mean,
''Let me have what''?

53:04.828 --> 53:06.625
I believe we talked
about a key...

53:06.663 --> 53:08.096
to somebody's
grandmother's house.

53:08.131 --> 53:11.396
Oh, that. Look, Rick...

53:11.435 --> 53:13.630
I looked all over for it.
I couldn't find it.

53:13.670 --> 53:16.833
- Didn't we look for it, David?
- We couldn't find it anywhere.

53:16.874 --> 53:18.967
Well, that's great.
Thanks for telling me on time.

53:19.009 --> 53:20.704
Now what am I supposed to do?

53:20.744 --> 53:22.803
David, what about
your parents' guest house?

53:22.846 --> 53:24.837
No way. That's been off limits
since Big Earl...

53:24.882 --> 53:27.373
smoked angel dust
and he ate my mom's parakeet.

53:27.417 --> 53:29.647
I'll be cool.
All I need is an hour with her.

53:29.686 --> 53:31.176
Sorry, man.
I wish I could help you.

53:31.221 --> 53:33.689
Guess you'll just have
to call it off, Rick.

53:33.724 --> 53:35.191
Come on, David, let's go.

53:35.225 --> 53:37.159
What are you guys
in such a rush to do?

53:37.194 --> 53:39.628
There's a lady that's
just waitin' to lay us.

53:39.663 --> 53:42.223
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- The redhead.

53:42.266 --> 53:44.393
The one that Tommy's brother's
been screwing.

53:44.434 --> 53:47.028
- The one with the big tits?
- That's right, pal.

53:47.070 --> 53:49.561
We've been doing business
with her now for a while.

53:49.606 --> 53:50.903
Nine times already.

53:50.941 --> 53:53.637
You guys have screwed her
nine times...

53:53.677 --> 53:55.304
and you haven't even told me?

53:55.345 --> 53:57.142
We can't even talk
to you anymore.

53:57.180 --> 53:59.375
I mean, it's Karen this
and Karen that.

53:59.416 --> 54:01.543
You're too busy teeny-boppin'
all over the place.

54:01.585 --> 54:04.145
I thought you guys
were my friends.

54:04.187 --> 54:08.146
OK, we're asking you now, Rick.
You're comin' or you're not?

54:08.191 --> 54:11.592
How can I, Gary? I got a date
with Karen right now.

54:11.628 --> 54:13.061
There you go again.

54:13.096 --> 54:14.927
Come on, David, let's go.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.132
You just go
and play house with Karen.

54:25.542 --> 54:28.067
Wait up, you guys.

54:39.323 --> 54:41.291
So, what's the story, fellas?

54:41.325 --> 54:43.657
Do I have anything you want?

54:46.597 --> 54:48.224
Make up your mind, honey.

54:48.265 --> 54:51.234
You better go home before
your mother starts to miss you.

54:51.268 --> 54:52.826
Look, I don't know about this.

54:52.869 --> 54:55.895
Hey, wait a minute.
Are we gonna get laid or not?

54:55.939 --> 54:59.033
Money, guys, or Ruby walks.

54:59.076 --> 55:00.907
Well, how much
are we talkin' about?

55:00.944 --> 55:03.208
30 bucks is the goin' rate.

55:03.246 --> 55:05.111
Are we on or not?
What do you say?

55:05.148 --> 55:08.606
30 bucks? That's 10 apiece.
I think we can handle that.

55:08.652 --> 55:11.587
That's 30 bucks apiece, guys,
and it ain't negotiable, see?

55:11.622 --> 55:12.987
Jesus, that's 90 bucks!

55:13.023 --> 55:14.957
No, I can't afford that.
No way.

55:14.992 --> 55:18.428
Stop wastin' my time.
Take it or leave it.

55:18.462 --> 55:20.089
How about 75?

55:20.130 --> 55:22.098
How about goin' home to mama?

55:22.132 --> 55:24.623
OK, all right, hold on.

55:24.668 --> 55:27.068
Go ahead. Come on.

55:27.104 --> 55:30.699
Hey, man, I am workin' here,
and you are killin' my action.

55:37.514 --> 55:39.379
Come on, guys. Time is money.

55:39.416 --> 55:40.815
We ain't got all night.

55:40.851 --> 55:44.184
I'll show you a good time,
but let's move it. Come on.

55:44.221 --> 55:46.553
Move your fat ass.

55:46.590 --> 55:48.421
All right, cowboys,
who's first?

55:48.458 --> 55:50.358
I want to get this over with.

55:50.394 --> 55:52.089
Go ahead, Gary. You go first.

55:52.129 --> 55:54.927
Go on, Gary. Go on.

55:54.965 --> 55:56.592
Go.

55:56.633 --> 55:58.658
Come on.
This is my busiest night.

55:58.702 --> 56:00.693
Let's get it on.

56:03.206 --> 56:05.037
Come on, move it. Please?

56:17.487 --> 56:19.352
Come on,
let's get those pants off.

56:19.389 --> 56:21.687
We haven't got all night.

56:21.725 --> 56:24.853
You move like you don't want
to get laid.

56:31.935 --> 56:34.369
Look at that.

56:34.404 --> 56:35.598
What's the matter?

56:35.639 --> 56:37.573
You ain't still a virgin,
are you?

56:40.077 --> 56:42.170
Come on.

56:42.212 --> 56:44.043
Come over here.

56:53.390 --> 56:54.550
There.

56:56.526 --> 56:58.357
There, that's got it.

56:58.395 --> 57:01.626
Yeah, that's a lot better.

57:01.665 --> 57:03.826
Now it's wide awake.

57:06.203 --> 57:08.194
Now we can do business.

57:10.640 --> 57:11.800
Come on.

57:19.082 --> 57:21.073
Hurry up. Come on.

57:24.321 --> 57:26.050
No, dummy. Not there.

57:26.089 --> 57:28.683
Move up a little.

57:28.725 --> 57:31.091
There you go. OK, now.

57:31.128 --> 57:33.119
I wonder what's
taking him so long.

57:33.163 --> 57:36.132
Well, he might as well get
his thirty bucks worth, right?

57:36.166 --> 57:38.293
I think you mean my 30 bucks.

57:38.335 --> 57:40.667
Shit, move your ass.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.330
Shit.

57:47.077 --> 57:48.772
My goddamn luck.

57:48.812 --> 57:50.803
I get all the live ones.

57:52.616 --> 57:56.074
You've still got a lot to learn,
little boy, you know?

58:01.324 --> 58:04.521
Well, come on, fat-ass.
You're next.

58:05.595 --> 58:06.823
How was it?

58:06.863 --> 58:08.296
Go ahead, David.

58:08.331 --> 58:10.322
Go on, man. Go ahead.

58:16.206 --> 58:17.639
Hey, what's wrong?

58:27.484 --> 58:30.009
Hi, how's it going?

58:30.053 --> 58:32.021
It could be better.

58:32.055 --> 58:34.683
Cigarette?

58:34.724 --> 58:36.385
I have my own.

58:38.662 --> 58:40.254
Busy day for you today, huh?

58:40.297 --> 58:42.697
Are you here to interview me
or to fuck me?

58:54.077 --> 58:58.138
For this examination, you will
have exactly twenty minutes.

58:59.349 --> 59:03.149
I will expect silence,
absolute silence.

59:03.186 --> 59:05.154
There will be no...

59:05.188 --> 59:06.849
You're late again.

59:06.890 --> 59:09.290
There's no excuse
for this kind of behavior.

59:09.326 --> 59:11.556
I'm sorry, Mrs. Applebaum.

59:11.595 --> 59:13.927
I didn't sleep
'cause I haven't...

59:13.964 --> 59:16.159
I haven't been
feeling too well.

59:16.199 --> 59:19.498
Very well.
Go to your seat.

59:21.104 --> 59:22.765
And no talking.

59:28.311 --> 59:29.642
Begin.

59:32.698 --> 59:34.563
Rick.

59:34.600 --> 59:39.128
Rick! Shit.

59:39.171 --> 59:42.538
Rick! I can't stop itching!

59:42.575 --> 59:44.736
Me, too. It's driving me crazy.

59:44.777 --> 59:46.972
I know!

59:47.013 --> 59:48.640
What about David?

59:50.983 --> 59:52.245
Get David.

59:55.554 --> 59:58.182
- How do you feel?
- My balls are burning up.

59:58.224 --> 01:00:00.454
I know. Gary's, too.

01:00:00.493 --> 01:00:04.327
David, I'm dying. It hurts.

01:00:04.363 --> 01:00:05.853
I know.
I can't take it anymore.

01:00:05.898 --> 01:00:07.957
- What is it?
- I think I know.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.831
Gary! David! Richard!

01:00:09.869 --> 01:00:11.302
Out of this classroom at once.

01:00:11.337 --> 01:00:15.239
I warned you. Out!

01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:21.710
Report to the principal's
office right now.

01:00:25.685 --> 01:00:26.947
And close the door!

01:00:26.986 --> 01:00:28.317
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:31.824 --> 01:00:33.189
- Crabs?!
- Crabs?!

01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:35.216
Crabs! You know,
like head lice.

01:00:35.261 --> 01:00:37.058
What the hell
can we do about them?

01:00:37.096 --> 01:00:38.063
Please!

01:00:38.097 --> 01:00:39.257
Don't worry about it.

01:00:39.298 --> 01:00:42.165
I know a way we can get
rid of them like that.

01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:45.227
- You sure this will drown them?
- Positive.

01:00:45.271 --> 01:00:47.364
But I thought crabs
loved the water.

01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:49.101
Not this kind.

01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:51.336
- Yeah? How do you know?
- I know!

01:00:51.377 --> 01:00:53.845
Tommy had 'em and drowned them
in his parents' jacuzzi.

01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:55.904
It sure takes long enough
to kill these suckers.

01:00:55.948 --> 01:00:58.280
Do you know we've been
in here for four hours now?!

01:00:58.317 --> 01:01:00.182
Yeah, my back is already baked.

01:01:00.219 --> 01:01:02.084
Yeah, well, stop itching,
lover boys.

01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:03.554
If you two
remember correctly...

01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:06.285
you're the ones
that got me into this.

01:01:06.325 --> 01:01:08.486
Hey, guys, look who's here.

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.063
Hi, Gary.

01:01:13.099 --> 01:01:15.192
Hi.

01:01:15.234 --> 01:01:16.724
What happened to you
last night?

01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:18.703
I waited till 11:00 for you.

01:01:18.738 --> 01:01:21.036
What happened to me?
What happened to you?!

01:01:21.073 --> 01:01:23.769
I called you
at least ten times.

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:25.367
My phone didn't ring once.

01:01:25.411 --> 01:01:28.574
You're kidding!
You better get it checked, then.

01:01:28.614 --> 01:01:30.206
I was worried about you, Karen.

01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:32.877
We're gonna get some sun.
Are you staying here?

01:01:32.918 --> 01:01:34.886
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll be right with you.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.616
Come on.

01:01:37.656 --> 01:01:39.851
OK, that should do it.
Let's go.

01:01:44.163 --> 01:01:47.257
Rick, would you mind putting
some suntan lotion on my back?

01:01:47.299 --> 01:01:48.288
Sure.

01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:49.767
Gary?

01:01:49.802 --> 01:01:51.736
Yeah?

01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:55.502
Would you mind putting
some lotion on my back, too?

01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:56.667
Please?

01:01:56.709 --> 01:01:58.040
Fine.

01:01:58.077 --> 01:01:59.408
Thank you.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.844
What's been happening
in your life?

01:02:03.883 --> 01:02:07.148
Not a whole
hell of a lot, Rose.

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:19.798
How's the pizza world?

01:02:19.832 --> 01:02:21.629
It's round, Rose.

01:02:22.802 --> 01:02:25.999
- What's wrong?
- They didn't drown!

01:02:28.474 --> 01:02:29.634
I'll see you later.

01:02:29.675 --> 01:02:31.108
I'll be right back.

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:33.202
Hey, what's your hurry?

01:02:33.245 --> 01:02:35.577
Hey! Who didn't drown?

01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:41.713
I need something...

01:02:41.754 --> 01:02:43.517
to kill ticks.

01:02:43.556 --> 01:02:46.423
Oh, no problem.
What kind of a dog do you have?

01:02:46.459 --> 01:02:50.987
A collie, but it's not for him.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.193
I'm afraid I don't know
what you mean.

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:56.827
It's not really ticks.

01:02:56.869 --> 01:02:58.928
Not ticks?

01:02:58.971 --> 01:03:02.634
Uh-uh. It's...

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:07.510
it's more like... lice.

01:03:07.546 --> 01:03:09.207
Oh, lice.

01:03:09.248 --> 01:03:11.512
Well, I've got
just the thing for you.

01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.485
I've got a special comb...

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.648
and it does very nicely
in these sort of things.

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.250
You'll find it
very, very efficient.

01:03:20.292 --> 01:03:21.953
No.

01:03:21.994 --> 01:03:24.485
- No?
- See...

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:28.364
it's not exactly lice, either.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.595
It's...

01:03:30.636 --> 01:03:33.537
Well, you see,
it itches a lot.

01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:35.403
Let me take a look
at your head here.

01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:38.171
I don't see anything
wrong with that.

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:41.509
Did you ever have any
allergy problems or anything?

01:03:41.547 --> 01:03:45.745
No. It's not on my head.

01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:47.081
So where is it?

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:49.110
It's...

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:56.250
it's down there.

01:04:02.368 --> 01:04:05.064
Your balls itch?

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:14.809
Crabs! At your age!

01:04:14.847 --> 01:04:19.375
Young people... not what
they used to be in my...

01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:24.481
Don't worry about it.
I got just the thing for you.

01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:30.291
If you'll take this and apply it
three times a day...

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:33.025
those little things'll
go away in no time.

01:04:33.065 --> 01:04:34.032
Thank you.

01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:35.090
You're welcome.

01:04:35.134 --> 01:04:36.431
Pay him.

01:04:36.468 --> 01:04:37.628
How much do I owe you?

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:39.137
$3.99.

01:04:42.241 --> 01:04:46.735
Crab... killer.

01:04:46.779 --> 01:04:49.145
$3.99.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.232
Extra points. David...

01:05:17.276 --> 01:05:19.437
- Hey, Big Apple.
- Hey, Gary. How's it going?

01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:21.571
OK. Have you seen
Karen around here?

01:05:21.614 --> 01:05:23.548
Yeah. She should be
around here somewhere.

01:05:23.582 --> 01:05:25.174
Because I saw
her moped outside.

01:05:25.217 --> 01:05:26.878
I saw her go
with Rick somewhere.

01:05:26.919 --> 01:05:28.853
Yeah, but they
should be right back.

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:31.378
- Where did they go?
- They probably went for a walk.

01:05:31.423 --> 01:05:33.618
Bullshit, David. He took her
to the football field...

01:05:33.659 --> 01:05:36.321
to bust her cherry,
and you know it.

01:05:37.463 --> 01:05:39.124
Hey, Gary, hold up!

01:05:42.534 --> 01:05:44.195
Asshole!

01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:12.501
Gary, what are you doing here?

01:09:12.544 --> 01:09:15.011
Nothing much.
Where have you been?

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:17.537
I was out
on the football field.

01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:19.050
By yourself?

01:09:19.084 --> 01:09:22.611
No, with Karen.
She's right over there.

01:09:22.654 --> 01:09:25.145
Just you two?

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:28.091
Of course. I couldn't
wait around for you...

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:30.424
to give me the key
to your grandmother's house.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:31.554
Meaning what?

01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:35.430
Meaning that I was the first one
to get to Miss Thing over there.

01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:36.593
You what?

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:38.500
I fucked Karen.

01:09:38.537 --> 01:09:41.267
You're full of shit.
You're lying!

01:09:41.305 --> 01:09:43.831
What do you want me to do,
show you an instant replay?

01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:44.843
You fucked Karen?!

01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:47.175
She'll hear you!

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:54.951
Man, you're a fucking liar
and you know it.

01:09:54.987 --> 01:09:57.683
Hi, Gary. How's it going?

01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:10.965
What's wrong with him?

01:10:56.415 --> 01:11:00.112
Just think, three more days
to Christmas vacation.

01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:01.346
It's gonna be great.

01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:02.910
Yeah, just great.

01:11:02.955 --> 01:11:05.321
What's the matter with you?
You should be happy.

01:11:05.357 --> 01:11:09.316
Just think, a week from today,
we'll all be on the slopes.

01:11:09.361 --> 01:11:11.556
Next time, bring your book
back on time...

01:11:11.597 --> 01:11:14.964
if you don't want to pay a fine.
We charge for every day overdue.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.160
- Hi.
- Yes?

01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:18.226
Do you have the October issue
of Consumer Reports?

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.498
- What year?
- '80.

01:11:19.538 --> 01:11:21.802
- I'll look.
- Thanks.

01:11:24.209 --> 01:11:26.439
I don't want
to know about it, OK?

01:11:26.478 --> 01:11:29.379
We're completely through.
I told you that already.

01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:32.212
Why are you coming here with
all these fucking people around?

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.150
I told you that
we're through anyway...

01:11:34.186 --> 01:11:37.019
so why don't you just split
and leave me alone, OK?

01:11:37.055 --> 01:11:39.023
Don't you know what you did?

01:11:39.057 --> 01:11:40.581
Would you get the fuck
out of here already?

01:11:40.626 --> 01:11:43.823
You're embarrassing
the shit out of me. Now split!

01:11:43.862 --> 01:11:45.352
God...

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:23.301
Karen?

01:12:23.335 --> 01:12:25.303
What's wrong?

01:12:26.872 --> 01:12:29.397
It's got nothing
to do with you.

01:12:29.441 --> 01:12:31.602
I saw you two
arguing in there.

01:12:31.643 --> 01:12:35.511
It's over between us,
so it doesn't matter.

01:12:35.547 --> 01:12:37.412
So why are you crying, then?

01:12:37.449 --> 01:12:41.749
Look... I'll be all right.

01:12:43.488 --> 01:12:48.289
Relax. You know all couples
have their moments.

01:12:48.326 --> 01:12:51.090
He'll cool off. I know him.
Don't worry about it.

01:12:51.129 --> 01:12:53.689
I really don't care
what he does!

01:12:53.732 --> 01:12:55.791
He will get over it.

01:12:55.834 --> 01:12:57.199
I'm...

01:12:57.235 --> 01:12:58.930
I'm pregnant.

01:13:07.713 --> 01:13:11.308
Look, hey, don't worry.

01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:14.750
It's gonna be all right.

01:13:14.786 --> 01:13:18.415
Come on, listen to me.

01:13:18.457 --> 01:13:21.051
OK, I want you to get
yourself together...

01:13:21.093 --> 01:13:25.792
and don't breathe
a word of this to anyone.

01:13:25.831 --> 01:13:28.766
I'm gonna take care of this,
understand?

01:13:31.503 --> 01:13:34.301
I'm gonna help you.

01:13:34.339 --> 01:13:36.705
OK?

01:13:36.742 --> 01:13:38.471
OK.

01:13:50.288 --> 01:13:52.051
What's your problem?

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.082
She's pregnant
and you know it.

01:13:55.127 --> 01:13:57.857
Good news travels fast, huh?

01:13:57.896 --> 01:13:59.625
What are you gonna do,
come to her rescue?

01:13:59.664 --> 01:14:01.359
That's what you should
be doing, Ricky.

01:14:01.399 --> 01:14:03.594
Hey, what's it got
to do with you, man?

01:14:03.635 --> 01:14:05.967
Anyway, I've had it with her.
It's over.

01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:10.498
That's very convenient,
isn't it?

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:12.567
Hey, she's been getting
on my nerves.

01:14:12.611 --> 01:14:14.408
She's pregnant, you creep!

01:14:14.446 --> 01:14:16.505
So what? She's not the first.

01:14:16.548 --> 01:14:18.277
Yeah, but you were!
Have you forgotten?

01:14:18.316 --> 01:14:21.649
Me? The first?
Forget it, buddy.

01:14:21.686 --> 01:14:23.881
What are you trying to say?

01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:27.449
That I'm probably not the only
guy that ever screwed her.

01:14:27.492 --> 01:14:31.360
You take that back before
I decide to bust your head open!

01:14:31.396 --> 01:14:33.887
I'll say whatever I like,
you asshole!

01:14:39.905 --> 01:14:42.135
Stop it!
I will not have that in here!

01:14:42.174 --> 01:14:43.573
You're jealous
'cause it wasn't you!

01:14:43.608 --> 01:14:45.735
You're a stupid asshole!

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:49.235
Anytime, pizza boy!
Anytime, man!

01:14:49.281 --> 01:14:51.181
You're the biggest load
I've ever met!

01:14:51.216 --> 01:14:54.811
You are gonna regret this,
Gary, man.

01:14:54.853 --> 01:14:56.912
You're nothing
but a piece of shit!

01:14:56.955 --> 01:15:00.083
I will call the principal
if you don't get out of here!

01:15:09.634 --> 01:15:11.465
David, you geek, come on, man.

01:15:11.503 --> 01:15:13.095
We've been waiting for you.
Get it together.

01:15:13.138 --> 01:15:15.299
- David!
- Come on, man!

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:24.012
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

01:15:24.049 --> 01:15:26.347
Come on! All right! Come on!

01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:32.481
Hey, come on!

01:15:32.524 --> 01:15:34.617
Hey, wait! Where you going?

01:15:36.795 --> 01:15:39.525
Come on, man!
Hurry up! Get in!

01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:53.273
That's OK. I got it.

01:15:53.311 --> 01:15:55.302
Go on in.

01:16:04.623 --> 01:16:06.716
It's been empty for a year.

01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:09.886
Every since my grandmother died,
nobody's been here.

01:16:11.296 --> 01:16:14.163
It'll look better
once I put up the blinds.

01:16:17.969 --> 01:16:20.233
It needs a little cleaning.

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:31.543
Good. At least she left us
a working radio.

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:34.814
Karen, do you want to see
a picture of me when I was two?

01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:46.895
Please... don't cry.

01:16:51.036 --> 01:16:52.799
I promise...

01:16:52.837 --> 01:16:55.499
I promise you
it'll be all right.

01:16:58.977 --> 01:17:01.639
Karen, I know dozens of girls
who have been through it...

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.170
and it was fine.

01:17:07.185 --> 01:17:09.653
Please, I promise.
Just don't cry.

01:17:10.989 --> 01:17:12.320
You know, of course...

01:17:12.357 --> 01:17:14.484
there are certain precautions
you could have taken...

01:17:14.526 --> 01:17:17.620
before the few moments
of pleasure that you enjoyed.

01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:23.094
The operation itself
is quite simple.

01:17:23.134 --> 01:17:26.865
Still, it does cost money.
$250 to be exact.

01:17:26.905 --> 01:17:31.137
That's OK. I can cover that.

01:17:31.176 --> 01:17:34.805
- Cash.
- Cash.

01:17:34.846 --> 01:17:37.838
Fine. You'll bring it
with you this evening.

01:17:37.882 --> 01:17:39.474
Now, I'd like you to leave us.

01:17:39.517 --> 01:17:41.508
Come back at 6:00.
She'll be ready then.

01:18:58.997 --> 01:19:02.296
Look, I need to know
how much I can get for this.

01:19:02.333 --> 01:19:03.800
This is my stereo...

01:19:15.647 --> 01:19:18.013
Thank you.

01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:34.557
Hey, Gino, I gotta talk to you.

01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:37.830
The Olympic ski team is back.
Can't you see I'm busy?

01:19:37.869 --> 01:19:39.598
Gino, please,
will you listen to me?

01:19:39.637 --> 01:19:40.729
What?

01:19:40.772 --> 01:19:42.569
I gotta borrow a hundred bucks.

01:19:42.607 --> 01:19:44.575
You gotta? You gotta get
your ass outta here.

01:19:44.609 --> 01:19:46.509
Hundred bucks. Are you crazy?

01:19:46.544 --> 01:19:48.637
Look, I'm serious. I mean it.

01:19:54.219 --> 01:19:57.484
Gino, please.
It's an emergency.

01:20:16.674 --> 01:20:17.971
How is she?

01:20:18.009 --> 01:20:19.340
She's fine.

01:20:19.377 --> 01:20:21.436
She's resting.

01:20:21.479 --> 01:20:22.969
She's in Room 16.

01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:24.811
You can take her home now.

01:23:00.405 --> 01:23:01.565
Gary?

01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:02.732
Yeah?

01:23:02.774 --> 01:23:04.765
Where did you put
the yellow towel?

01:23:04.809 --> 01:23:07.175
It's on the chair.

01:23:07.211 --> 01:23:08.872
Oh, I see it.

01:23:14.085 --> 01:23:16.144
Come on,
your eggs are getting cold.

01:23:16.187 --> 01:23:17.848
I'll be right there.

01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:22.817
Good morning.

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.021
Good morning. I'm so hungry.

01:23:26.364 --> 01:23:28.594
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, fine.

01:23:28.633 --> 01:23:30.601
I'm sorry you had to sleep
on the couch...

01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:32.102
because of me last night.

01:23:32.136 --> 01:23:34.036
That's OK.
Look, if we'd gone skiing...

01:23:34.072 --> 01:23:36.666
I would've been sleeping
on a cold floor somewhere.

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:38.699
I wonder how they're all doing.

01:23:40.578 --> 01:23:43.979
Are you sorry you didn't go?

01:23:44.015 --> 01:23:45.243
A little.

01:23:45.283 --> 01:23:49.083
Do you miss anyone?

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.781
What do you mean?

01:23:50.822 --> 01:23:53.017
I don't know. I just...

01:23:53.057 --> 01:23:55.423
No, I just wondered
if you missed, you know...

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.189
the gang, or anything.

01:23:57.228 --> 01:23:59.219
Not really.

01:24:00.965 --> 01:24:02.933
I'll make up for it
at my party.

01:24:02.967 --> 01:24:04.958
- What party?
- My birthday party.

01:24:05.002 --> 01:24:06.333
Your birthday? When?

01:24:06.371 --> 01:24:07.599
This Saturday.

01:24:07.638 --> 01:24:09.230
Am I invited?

01:24:09.273 --> 01:24:11.969
That's a dumb question.

01:24:15.613 --> 01:24:17.979
Why are you doing that now?

01:24:18.015 --> 01:24:21.712
I just wanted
to get everything ready.

01:24:21.753 --> 01:24:23.846
You could do it
tomorrow morning.

01:24:23.888 --> 01:24:27.153
Nah, I'd just rather
get it done now.

01:24:28.493 --> 01:24:30.791
Gary?

01:24:30.828 --> 01:24:32.819
I want you to know
I really appreciate...

01:24:32.864 --> 01:24:36.027
everything you've done for me.

01:24:36.067 --> 01:24:38.535
Karen, you're more
than welcome.

01:24:38.569 --> 01:24:40.628
No, you've been a true friend.

01:24:40.671 --> 01:24:42.730
I can't think of anyone
who would've done...

01:24:42.774 --> 01:24:45.641
what you've done for me.

01:24:45.676 --> 01:24:48.304
Karen...

01:24:50.381 --> 01:24:52.372
it's just that...

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:56.512
that...

01:25:02.627 --> 01:25:03.992
I love you.

01:25:06.798 --> 01:25:08.959
I always have.

01:25:11.769 --> 01:25:14.101
Ever since I first saw you...

01:25:16.441 --> 01:25:18.568
I've loved you.

01:25:18.609 --> 01:25:20.941
I could never tell you, but...

01:25:25.116 --> 01:25:26.378
I love you.

01:26:25.676 --> 01:26:27.200
Hi, Dad.

01:26:27.245 --> 01:26:29.338
Hey, you're back!

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:31.610
Martha, Gary's home!

01:26:33.718 --> 01:26:35.743
- So, how was the trip?
- Good.

01:26:35.786 --> 01:26:37.185
I heard you had great snow.

01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:40.156
Wonderful, sweetheart.

01:26:40.191 --> 01:26:42.785
You could've at least sent
your mother a postcard.

01:26:42.827 --> 01:26:43.953
Martha.

01:26:43.995 --> 01:26:46.361
There weren't any mailboxes
where we were, Mom.

01:26:46.397 --> 01:26:49.264
So then how come David's mom
got four postcards?

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.565
You see, David chickened out
and stayed behind...

01:26:52.603 --> 01:26:54.093
while we were up at the slopes.

01:26:54.138 --> 01:26:56.504
You have an excuse
for everything.

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:58.702
Oh, my God. The roast.

01:26:58.743 --> 01:27:00.608
Come here.

01:27:00.645 --> 01:27:02.977
Come on. Welcome home.

01:27:06.517 --> 01:27:08.109
How much is it?

01:27:08.152 --> 01:27:09.585
Like it?

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.110
It's beautiful.

01:27:11.155 --> 01:27:12.247
$80.

01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:14.554
I'll take it.

01:27:14.592 --> 01:27:17.152
And I'd like something
inscribed on it.

01:27:17.194 --> 01:27:18.821
What would you like on it?

01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:21.331
''To Karen with love. ''

01:27:21.365 --> 01:27:22.957
''To Karen with love. ''

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.969
Yeah, and when
will it be ready?

01:27:26.003 --> 01:27:27.527
Monday.

01:27:27.572 --> 01:27:29.472
No, that's no good.

01:27:29.507 --> 01:27:30.804
Why not?

01:27:30.841 --> 01:27:33.867
You see, it's a birthday present
for my girlfriend...

01:27:33.911 --> 01:27:35.503
and tomorrow night's
her birthday.

01:27:35.546 --> 01:27:37.980
All right. Tomorrow night
it'll be ready.

01:27:38.015 --> 01:27:40.347
It will? Thanks.

01:27:40.384 --> 01:27:41.976
Look, I really appreciate it.

01:27:42.019 --> 01:27:43.680
And remember...

01:27:43.721 --> 01:27:45.848
''To Karen... '' with a ''K''...

01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:46.914
''with love. ''

01:27:46.958 --> 01:27:49.483
''To Karen with love. '' Got it.

01:27:49.527 --> 01:27:51.859
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks.

01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:32.226
- Hey, Gary, what's goin' on?
- Not much. Where's Karen?

01:28:32.269 --> 01:28:33.827
She's somewhere around here.

01:28:33.871 --> 01:28:34.963
OK, thanks.

01:28:35.006 --> 01:28:36.405
- Hi, Gary.
- Hi.

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.600
What's that for?

01:28:37.642 --> 01:28:40.110
Oh, it's nothing.
Victor, have you seen Karen?

01:28:40.144 --> 01:28:42.442
Yeah, I think I saw her
go in the kitchen.

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.539
Great. Thanks, Vic.

01:28:44.582 --> 01:28:45.879
Sure.
