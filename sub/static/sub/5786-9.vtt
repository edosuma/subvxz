00:00.961 --> 00:02.587
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.796 --> 00:05.632
<i>I need everything
you can tell me about
Mr. Boss' crime organization.</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:07.217
We need
to make zombie rats to test
whether or not

00:07.425 --> 00:09.469
this Utopium can truly lead
to a zombie cure.

00:09.719 --> 00:11.763
I could be with Major.

00:11.972 --> 00:14.349
That was
the tainted Utopium
Max Rager combination

00:14.557 --> 00:16.768
I was going to use
to make the cure.

00:16.977 --> 00:18.687
We are back to square one.

00:18.895 --> 00:21.106
<i>Someone is going around
the city taking out zombies.</i>

00:21.314 --> 00:22.774
<i>You and I
are going to be fine.</i>

00:22.983 --> 00:25.318
Being with zombie me
is different than being
with old me.

00:25.527 --> 00:26.778
What about Liv?

00:26.987 --> 00:28.613
How extreme do her personality
swings get?

00:28.822 --> 00:30.532
<i>She can be a bit mercurial.</i>

00:30.740 --> 00:34.160
This brain I'm on,
apparently the woman was
an unhinged stalker.

00:34.369 --> 00:36.871
<i>We have to be totally
honest with each other
this time around.</i>

00:59.310 --> 01:00.645
Get up, bitch.

01:04.149 --> 01:07.360
Prey on the weak.
Feast on my fury.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.461
I'm The Fog.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.588
And tonight...

01:26.755 --> 01:29.215
I'm thick with justice.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.391
How can you not see
that you're the one
who is in the wrong here?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.561
While I was sleeping, you used
my finger to unlock my phone.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.815
You snooped through my texts.
You sent a text to a girl
I used to date,

02:27.023 --> 02:28.983
a girl I told you
I ended things with.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.861
If it's so over, why is she
texting you half-naked
photos of herself?

02:32.070 --> 02:34.572
Oh, my God. This fight
is freakin' <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

02:34.781 --> 02:36.783
I can't keep saying the same
thing over and over again.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.701
Then how about you just try
telling me the truth?

02:38.910 --> 02:40.411
Okay, so keep doing
the thing I've been doing

02:40.620 --> 02:41.871
for the past five hours.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.706
No "pfft!" There's no "pfft!"

02:43.915 --> 02:45.500
All right, you should've been
able to see from your snooping

02:45.708 --> 02:47.335
that I haven't texted her
since we got back together.

02:47.544 --> 02:50.255
How do I know that you didn't
call her from a landline?

02:50.463 --> 02:53.091
Because it's not 1987.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.968
I can't help this, Major.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.427
One minute, you're
defending your actions,

02:56.636 --> 02:57.929
and the next,
you're blaming the brain.

02:58.138 --> 02:59.722
- Which is it?
- It's both!

02:59.931 --> 03:01.641
From one minute to the next!
It's both!

03:01.850 --> 03:03.434
You think
it's dizzying to witness,

03:03.643 --> 03:06.271
imagine what it's like having
that go on inside your head.

03:08.481 --> 03:12.235
Sorry for
interrupting round 3,008,
but we have a body, Liv.

03:20.076 --> 03:22.871
I was afraid
this would happen.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.290
You were afraid someone
would find a grown-ass man

03:25.498 --> 03:27.750
wearing a cape in the back
of a garbage truck?

03:27.959 --> 03:29.377
Pretty specific fear.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.462
Everyone on the force
knew this guy.

03:31.671 --> 03:34.340
His name is Chris Allred,
AKA The Fog.

03:34.549 --> 03:36.843
He was a high school shop
teacher by day, but at night,

03:37.051 --> 03:39.429
he put on a costume
and patrol the streets.

03:39.637 --> 03:41.389
He considered himself
a real-life superhero.

03:41.598 --> 03:43.474
So he was crazy?

03:43.683 --> 03:46.978
I'm sorry, Seattle has
a vigilante crime fighter
called The Fog?

03:47.187 --> 03:48.396
How did I not know about this?

03:48.563 --> 03:50.440
Oh, we've got a few
superhero wannabes here.

03:54.444 --> 03:56.321
I've gotta take this.

03:56.529 --> 03:59.657
- Babineaux.
- Sorry if we kept
you up last night.

03:59.866 --> 04:02.160
I'm just glad the body
we're working on
is not Major's.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.579
I spent the night
worried you were going
to rage out.

04:04.787 --> 04:08.958
"Hell hath no fury like
a zombie on stalker brain
thinking she's been scorned."

04:09.167 --> 04:10.793
It wasn't just thinking.

04:11.002 --> 04:13.171
- He got a text from...
- Oh, my God.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.424
Don't. Please, stop. No.

04:16.633 --> 04:18.843
Apparently, The Fog foiled
a mugging last night.

04:19.052 --> 04:21.304
The victim is still
at the station
looking over mug shots.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.223
I'm going to head over
to talk to her.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.600
Got a good chance one
of the muggers is our killer.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.647
Well, climb on in,
start scooching him forward.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.190
Are you serious?

04:32.398 --> 04:33.983
Were you thinking
I'd lay out the body bag out

04:34.192 --> 04:35.944
and wait for
The Fog to roll in?

04:40.657 --> 04:42.784
Cause of death
is blunt force trauma
to the head.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.202
But the guy was a mess.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.412
Contusions at various stages
of healing,

04:46.621 --> 04:49.958
ribs that look like he broke
a different one every week.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.210
The Fog certainly
took some licks for
the greater good.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.379
Ravi, the most
this guy ever did

04:54.587 --> 04:56.214
was momentarily
distract criminals,

04:56.422 --> 04:58.383
who were shocked to see
a grown man in tights.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.593
I disagree.

05:00.802 --> 05:03.179
I think it's noble to go out
and pursue danger
to protect the innocent,

05:03.388 --> 05:05.431
to be an active
symbol of hope.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.226
To show the world that one
person can make a difference.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.770
I just think
it's kind of ridiculous.

05:10.979 --> 05:12.230
Would you say that to Batman?

05:12.438 --> 05:14.607
If he were real, yes, I would.

05:14.816 --> 05:17.193
You should be a little
more open to this.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.779
I mean, we don't know which
of Chris Allred's personality
traits will be more dominant.

05:19.988 --> 05:22.198
Shop teacher
or superhero wannabe.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.284
Will you start rappelling
down the sides of buildings

05:24.492 --> 05:26.661
or should I expect
a personalized spice rack?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.579
I don't think my relationship
can take another minute

05:28.788 --> 05:30.623
of stalker brain,
so I'll take either.

05:33.418 --> 05:34.877
I don't know,

05:35.086 --> 05:37.213
it looks to me like you have
the makings of a hero.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.324
Excuse me?

06:04.532 --> 06:05.450
Do you know what time it is?

06:05.658 --> 06:07.785
It's time to be honest.

06:07.994 --> 06:12.457
That is some lackluster
effort, buddy.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.834
I'm not saying you had
to bring your A-game,
but, yeesh!

06:19.547 --> 06:21.632
Ah.

06:21.841 --> 06:24.177
For future reference,
I think you're a guy who
can probably just get away

06:24.385 --> 06:26.679
with saying "Hi"
and introducing yourself.

06:37.690 --> 06:40.568
As a man who's
mentally assembled
his own utility belt,

06:40.777 --> 06:41.903
I find The Fog's impressive.

06:44.822 --> 06:45.823
Carabiner hooks.

06:46.491 --> 06:47.450
Oh!

06:48.743 --> 06:50.495
- Giant marble.
- Marble?

06:50.703 --> 06:52.163
Always handy.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.999
Mace.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.459
No. No, wait.

06:57.168 --> 06:58.795
It's chloroform.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.506
And the handiest
of crime-fighting tools,

07:01.714 --> 07:02.882
duct tape.

07:03.091 --> 07:05.093
Our mugging victim
ID'd her assailants.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.844
They were both in the system.

07:07.053 --> 07:08.930
They're not
in the system.

07:10.306 --> 07:11.391
They are the system.

07:13.101 --> 07:15.686
Yeah, not really following.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.439
There are bad people
in this world.

07:18.648 --> 07:21.859
We put them in cages,
expect them to change,

07:22.068 --> 07:23.528
they never do.

07:23.736 --> 07:26.364
So no spice rack, then.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.533
Great. So I spoke
to each mugger's P.O.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.243
and got a last place
of employment.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.870
Turns out, they work together.
Wanna go check them out?

07:33.079 --> 07:34.622
I make time for justice.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.715
There is something not right
about this place,

07:44.924 --> 07:46.884
- I can feel it in the air.
- Coming through.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.513
Look at that.
Now, that's a tree.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.558
Twenty feet
of noble fir.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.810
That Santa,
I've seen him before.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.312
That's Mr. Boss.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.857
He's head of the biggest
crime syndicate in Seattle.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.237
So all this Santa
delivers to our city

08:06.446 --> 08:07.864
is crime.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.787
Can I help you, Detective?

08:14.996 --> 08:16.914
Do you know these two men?

08:17.123 --> 08:19.292
Carlos Rena and Jerry Byrd.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.419
No. I can't say that I do.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.463
Do you know anything about
a vigilante crime fighter

08:23.671 --> 08:24.797
who called himself "The Fog"?

08:25.006 --> 08:26.757
- The Frog?
- The Fog.

08:26.966 --> 08:29.677
No, I don't. What exactly is
a "vigilante crime fighter?"

08:29.886 --> 08:32.513
You know what he is,
a superhero.

08:32.722 --> 08:35.308
A selfless defender of those
who can't defend themselves.

08:36.267 --> 08:37.727
I see.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.437
I don't want to pretend
I know how to do your job,

08:39.645 --> 08:41.814
but it just seems to me,
your best bet

08:42.023 --> 08:43.524
would be to aim a floodlight

08:43.733 --> 08:46.986
into the night sky
with his logo burned into it.

08:47.195 --> 08:48.237
I'm sure he'd find you.

08:48.446 --> 08:49.989
He was murdered last night.

08:50.198 --> 08:52.533
His body was discovered
not too far from here.

08:52.742 --> 08:54.994
This city.

08:55.203 --> 08:57.663
Well, I should get
back to the kids.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.874
We don't want them to
find out the truth about me,
now, do we?

09:01.792 --> 09:04.629
You know,
that I'm not really Santa.

09:08.925 --> 09:11.260
- He was toying with us.
- Yeah, I got that.

09:11.469 --> 09:14.347
I already have a couple
of unis checking the muggers'
last known residence.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.640
Maybe we'll get
something there.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.938
I am going to end you!

09:24.440 --> 09:26.859
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

09:30.530 --> 09:32.698
Do you always find
tic-tac-toe so riveting?

09:32.907 --> 09:35.826
The Fog, he was attacked
by another guy in a costume.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.703
Tic-Tac-Toe Man,
or something.

09:37.912 --> 09:41.749
That's Hashtag.
I'll bring him in.

09:41.958 --> 09:45.211
- He's another joker in a mask.
- You know where to find him?

09:45.419 --> 09:49.006
All you have to do to summon
Hashtag is to hashtag Hashtag.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.428
He's dying.
You gotta help me.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.680
We usually wait till
they're all the way dead

09:55.888 --> 09:57.640
before bringing
them down here.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.017
- Who shot him?
- This is so bad.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.103
This is so bad,
you got to do something.

10:02.270 --> 10:03.396
Damn it, Don E.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.189
I'm a brain dealer,
not a doctor.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.235
Who is this poor sap?

10:13.573 --> 10:14.949
Do you know who this is?

10:16.450 --> 10:17.451
Yeah.

10:20.121 --> 10:23.040
And what the hell were you
thinking, bringing him here?

10:24.792 --> 10:27.378
"Super Dead," that's just
too awkward to say.

10:27.587 --> 10:29.130
"Help me, Super Dead."

10:29.338 --> 10:31.841
Ooh! "Mighty Whitey!"
What do you think?

10:32.049 --> 10:35.011
I think I would be the Ku Klux
Klan's favorite superhero.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.096
Fair enough.

10:37.305 --> 10:39.181
What do you think
about calling yourself

10:39.390 --> 10:41.851
"Doctor Power"?

10:42.059 --> 10:44.353
"Dead Power"? "Doctor Dead"?

10:44.562 --> 10:46.731
How about "Snow Woman"?

10:46.939 --> 10:48.024
Because you're
ice-cold, right?

10:48.232 --> 10:49.567
Potentially deadly and...

10:49.775 --> 10:51.777
A woman. Clever.

10:51.986 --> 10:54.280
Ideally, the name
should be symbolic

10:54.488 --> 10:57.491
and correspond with your
aesthetic and/or powers.

10:58.117 --> 10:59.368
Okay.

10:59.577 --> 11:01.871
Give this one a moment.
Don't say no right away.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.125
"Ol' Scratchy"!

11:06.334 --> 11:08.002
This city needs
more than a symbol.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.754
Yeah, just keep saying
stuff like that.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.839
I'll follow behind you,
jotting notes
for the graphic novel.

11:15.301 --> 11:17.637
- You?
- Twins. I'm Scott E's brother.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.430
You've got
the system a bit backwards.

11:19.639 --> 11:21.098
Your job is to take
the bodies away.

11:21.307 --> 11:24.685
Well, lucky for all of us,
this body ain't dead yet.

11:24.894 --> 11:26.020
Oh, my God.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.318
I think we're already
too late.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.653
No. There's a heartbeat.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.154
Barely.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.531
We are not
an emergency room.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.575
We're not equipped for this.

11:39.784 --> 11:41.911
This man is dying,
and your first thought
is to bring him here?

11:42.119 --> 11:43.663
Actually, my first thought
was to call you and have
you come to my place,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.373
but I had some concern
you wouldn't show, so...

11:45.581 --> 11:47.041
He's deteriorating
to bradycardia.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.668
There's no way he'll make it.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.170
Well, there's one way.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.218
Now, before you get
all self-righteous,

11:57.385 --> 11:59.470
know that this dying man,

11:59.679 --> 12:02.640
he's the only person who knows
where to find tainted Utopium.

12:02.848 --> 12:05.309
The real stuff, the stuff
left over from the boat party.

12:05.518 --> 12:07.687
So if he croaks, so does
our hope for a cure.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.522
Why should we believe you?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.399
What can I say?
It's gonna be a gamble
on your part.

12:11.607 --> 12:15.152
Liv, I can't move forward
without more tainted Utopium.

12:16.529 --> 12:17.822
I simply can't.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.324
Scratch him,
and by this afternoon,

12:20.533 --> 12:23.160
you will have all
the tainted Utopium
the good doctor needs.

12:23.369 --> 12:25.871
Not to mention,
that this cat'll still be
amongst the living.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.289
He may rather be dead.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.041
Tick-tock, Doc.

12:53.733 --> 12:56.986
Hey, let's get some mojitos.
You know, celebrate.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.988
The next shift is showing up
here in 10 minutes.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.990
This would be
rather hard to explain.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.783
Gotta zip you back up, friend.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.201
Down you go.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.583
We'll stop by your place later
to check on him

13:10.791 --> 13:12.752
and to pick up
the tainted Utopium.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.919
Look forward to it.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.892
Thanks for
coming in, Hashtag.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.185
We know you had a fight
with The Fog.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.978
We know you threatened
to end him.

13:31.187 --> 13:33.731
- Oh, that... That was nothing.
- You sucker punched him.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.567
- He had it coming.
- Why's that?

13:36.776 --> 13:38.944
The Fog thought he was
the king of the superheroes.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.738
Always bad-mouthing me
to the others.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.616
Then I find out he's got a
super-team and doesn't ask me.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.910
Do you know how many
marketing opportunities

13:46.118 --> 13:47.912
I was going to lose out on
if I wasn't included?

13:49.705 --> 13:51.624
- You ever hear of Snake Bite?
- No.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.918
But I bet you can
name everyone in the
Justice League, can't you?

13:54.126 --> 13:56.253
- Well...
- I rest my case.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.297
Why was he assembling a team?

13:58.506 --> 14:00.090
I only heard that The Fog
thought something big
was going down

14:00.299 --> 14:01.550
but couldn't handle it alone.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.761
I didn't get any details.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.056
Do you know who else
was going to be a part
of this, uh, team?

14:14.104 --> 14:15.064
I did get shot, right?

14:16.273 --> 14:17.900
Gut shot. Yeah.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.027
It was gnarly.

14:20.236 --> 14:21.403
At least
I know I'm not crazy.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.322
- How are you feeling?
- Fuzzy.

14:23.531 --> 14:24.865
Really friggin' hungry.

14:25.074 --> 14:27.618
Yeah, about that.
Why don't you have a seat?

14:27.827 --> 14:31.121
How familiar are you
with the movie...

14:31.330 --> 14:33.457
<i>- Dawn of the Dead?</i>
- I've seen it.

14:33.666 --> 14:36.001
Remember how that group
of survivors barricaded
themselves inside of a mall?

14:36.210 --> 14:37.294
Yeah.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.547
You're what's
outside of the mall.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.591
You're a zombie.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.179
You were dying, and in
an effort to save you...

14:48.973 --> 14:51.350
Well, we had a zombie
scratch you.

14:51.559 --> 14:55.062
I may have
buried the lead here.
Zombies are a real thing.

14:55.271 --> 14:56.480
So the fact that I crave...

14:56.689 --> 14:59.149
Brains?
Yeah, that's a zombie thing.

15:00.276 --> 15:01.402
But fear not,

15:01.610 --> 15:03.195
everything's gonna be
just fine.

15:03.404 --> 15:04.530
If you follow my instructions,

15:04.738 --> 15:06.657
you'll have all the brains
you need.

15:06.866 --> 15:08.075
I need brains.

15:08.284 --> 15:10.077
Sorry, wow.

15:10.286 --> 15:12.496
I am really rusty at the
"Welcome to Team Z" speech.

15:12.705 --> 15:13.664
I should've made pamphlets.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.332
Um...

15:15.541 --> 15:17.501
You need to eat brains
in order to stay functioning.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.795
If you don't,
your mind goes...

15:20.004 --> 15:22.840
Your flesh decays...
All the... All the tropes.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.884
But you don't need to
worry about that.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.219
I give you brains.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.221
You get a spray-tan,
a box of hair-dye

15:29.430 --> 15:31.307
and you just
keep on keeping on.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.818
Tell me what I need to do
to get these brains.

15:43.027 --> 15:45.321
I love that can-do spirit.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.347
Ghost Cobra. Gray Area.

16:53.555 --> 16:55.724
Superfly. Mega Fist.

16:56.684 --> 16:57.935
Blue Swallow.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.312
Detective Babineaux
needs your help.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.564
And someday, you may need his.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.110
Think of him
as your Jim Gordon.

17:06.318 --> 17:07.486
I'm not your Jim Gordon.

17:07.695 --> 17:09.822
That's right.
He's his own man.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.615
Detective Clive Babineaux.

17:11.824 --> 17:12.783
Remember that name.

17:12.992 --> 17:14.910
Your friend in the Seattle PD.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.996
Now what was it
that made The Fog

17:17.204 --> 17:18.914
want to form a super-team?

17:22.084 --> 17:25.295
The Fog heard Mr. Boss
was bringing in
a shipment of guns.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.131
Mr. Boss, huh?

17:27.339 --> 17:30.342
Yeah. He said
they were big-ass guns.

17:30.551 --> 17:31.593
So, what was the plan?

17:33.804 --> 17:37.266
We really didn't get to
the "hearing the plan" part.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.935
Mr. Boss? Guns?

17:40.144 --> 17:41.562
That's some
super-dangerous stuff.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.855
You disappoint me.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.690
Yeah,
that's what The Fog said.

17:45.733 --> 17:47.317
I'm sorry,

17:47.526 --> 17:49.778
I work at a cold-pressed
juicery during the day.

17:49.987 --> 17:52.156
I'm not taking on
a crime lord.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.449
Oh.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.618
Okay...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.871
Um...

17:59.079 --> 18:00.789
The body
of one of your muggers
was just discovered.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.297
Where's the body?

18:12.968 --> 18:16.680
I have no idea how
they got him up there
without anyone noticing.

18:16.889 --> 18:18.348
How tall do you think
that tree is, anyway?

18:19.349 --> 18:20.976
20 feet of noble fir.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.236
His throat was slashed.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.864
Mr. Boss's calling card.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.407
All right, he was hung
on the Christmas tree
post-mortem.

18:35.616 --> 18:36.658
I've got something.

18:37.785 --> 18:39.620
"447, North Palmetto Street."

18:40.871 --> 18:43.540
447, North Palmetto...

18:43.749 --> 18:46.001
That's the address for Mary,
our mugging victim.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.545
Why would the guy who tried to
mug her have her address?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.881
My guess is
he was afraid Mary

18:51.090 --> 18:52.925
saw him and his buddy
kill The Fog.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.885
He was hoping to get rid of
any evidence against him

18:55.094 --> 18:56.887
before Mr. Boss
got wind of it.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.305
There's a reason
Mr. Boss's men

18:58.514 --> 19:00.182
never get brought in
on murder charges.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.809
He kills them first.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.353
Doesn't like them to have
the opportunity to talk.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.355
I better send a unit
to Mary's house.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.857
No disrespect to the deceased,

19:09.066 --> 19:10.234
but I vote for
making this snappy.

19:10.442 --> 19:11.944
Blaine should have our
tainted Utopium by now.

19:15.489 --> 19:18.033
You're here just in time
for Drake's first feeding.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.536
It's intense, man!

19:20.744 --> 19:22.746
To eat brains or
not to eat brains?

19:22.955 --> 19:24.498
That is the question.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.958
It's a bit of an
acquired taste.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.001
You couldn't flavored it up
a bit for him?

19:28.210 --> 19:30.838
Sorry. The quality of
all the meals has really
gone downhill here

19:31.046 --> 19:33.966
since someone's boyfriend
offed my chef.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.761
Poor Don E. has been
reduced to eating
pepperoni pockets.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.555
That's much better. Thank you.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.057
And I guess I should thank you
for saving my life too, huh?

19:42.266 --> 19:43.517
You may want to wait
a couple weeks.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.060
See if you still
feel grateful.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.854
So, we'll be taking
that tainted Utopium now.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.605
Yeah, some bad news
on that front.

19:48.814 --> 19:49.898
You said he knew
where to find it.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.316
No, he... He does...

19:51.525 --> 19:54.444
It's just more in a general
sort of way.

19:54.653 --> 19:57.114
Drake, why don't you
share your story with
our friends here?

19:57.322 --> 20:00.576
Yeah, uh, old high school
buddy of mine, Vic,
he was a drug dealer.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.287
- He's an associate of mine.
- And mine.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.622
He got his leg blown off
in Afghanistan.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.541
So when he got home,
he couldn't find a job,

20:07.749 --> 20:09.334
started dealing.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.837
Street name, Pogo.
'Cause he had one of
those springy fake legs.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.298
One night he calls me
from the trunk of a car.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.508
Basically, him and this
other dealer, Larry,

20:16.717 --> 20:20.179
they swallowed a bunch of
condoms full of Utopium
in its powder form.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.181
They were trying to
smuggle it into Ibiza,

20:22.389 --> 20:24.141
sell some,
party with the rest.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.559
Except someone
must've found out,

20:25.767 --> 20:26.852
because when he called me,

20:27.060 --> 20:28.645
he was 100% sure
he was gonna die.

20:28.854 --> 20:30.856
Steal from Mr. Boss,
you're taking your life
in your hands.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.150
He was able to kick
the taillight out.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.277
Last thing that he saw
was the Jensen Water Tower.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.030
Then I heard the gunshot.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.116
So we have two bodies
packed full of tainted Utopium

20:41.325 --> 20:44.620
buried in a shallow grave
somewhere within sight
of that water tower.

20:44.828 --> 20:45.954
So we start digging.

20:46.163 --> 20:47.623
It's a needle
in a haystack, man.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.042
How do you know
whoever buried him didn't...

20:50.250 --> 20:51.835
...extract the Utopium
themselves?

20:52.044 --> 20:53.587
Because Mr. Boss
was still looking for it.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.507
How did you end up shot?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.719
My associate Don E.
has been trying to locate
this lost batch.

21:00.928 --> 21:02.346
He learned Drake
might know something

21:02.554 --> 21:04.306
and let that information
get into the wrong hands.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.682
Whoops.

21:05.891 --> 21:06.892
Something's burning.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.613
Someone went on a little trip.

21:20.489 --> 21:21.657
We need to leave.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.372
- Clive.
- There you are.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.873
I got a lead on
our second mugger.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.750
Carlos Rena is a diabetic.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.252
If he's hiding from Mr. Boss,

21:33.460 --> 21:35.212
he can't go home
to retrieve his medication.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.922
I found a cousin
who's a registered nurse.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.298
I sent a car to his house

21:38.507 --> 21:40.175
in case Carlos tries to
get his insulin there.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.094
I'm afraid we have more
dangerous fish to fry.

21:42.302 --> 21:43.679
We do?

21:43.887 --> 21:45.597
The Fog was right
about Mr. Boss's gun shipment.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.891
I saw one of his elves
blasting away.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.601
We need to get down there,

21:49.810 --> 21:51.144
and bust him before the guns
make it onto the streets.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.729
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.856
Calm down a second, okay?

21:55.065 --> 21:57.192
We can't just raid a place.
There's a protocol.

21:57.401 --> 21:59.736
First comes probable cause.
Then comes the warrant.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.989
I'm the probable cause.

22:02.197 --> 22:04.199
Liv, you know how this works.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.743
Judges don't issue warrants
based on psychic visions.

22:06.952 --> 22:08.287
- We can't...
- Babineaux.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.205
The uni you sent to check on
your mugging vic?

22:10.414 --> 22:12.124
He's saying the door was
wide open when he got there.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.043
The place was ransacked.
No sign of her.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.671
This is what I'm...

23:03.633 --> 23:05.177
Oh, no, no!

23:10.682 --> 23:12.309
Hey, there. It's okay.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.852
It's going to be okay.

23:21.735 --> 23:22.944
Stop, please.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.571
There are these people,

23:24.738 --> 23:26.031
they're forcing me
to hunt zombies

23:26.239 --> 23:27.574
or they'll kill my girlfriend.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.076
She's a zombie, too.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.959
So, you're the bogeyman?

23:39.461 --> 23:40.420
The bogeyman?

23:43.298 --> 23:45.717
The person taking out zombies.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.219
My pimp told me
there's a bogeyman

23:47.427 --> 23:48.887
out there thinning
the zombie herd.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.142
Your... Pimp?

23:57.187 --> 23:58.647
I was a call girl.

23:58.855 --> 24:00.524
The normal, human kind...

24:00.732 --> 24:03.318
Upscale clientele.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.613
Then this mystery man
contacts me.

24:06.822 --> 24:07.823
We have our date.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.324
And the next morning
I wake up,

24:09.533 --> 24:10.951
and guess what sounds
tasty to me?

24:11.159 --> 24:12.702
- Brains.
- Exactly.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.579
Then this John drops back by,

24:14.788 --> 24:17.249
welcomes me to "Team Z."

24:17.457 --> 24:19.042
And explains
that I was a zombie now

24:19.251 --> 24:22.504
and in exchange for the brains
I needed to survive,

24:22.712 --> 24:24.589
I would have to service
his zombie clients.

24:24.798 --> 24:26.425
That's horrible.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.678
Yeah. I literally got screwed
into becoming a zombie hooker.

24:29.886 --> 24:33.056
Before that, it was
all on my terms.

24:33.265 --> 24:36.435
I screened like crazy,
weeded out the skeezoids,

24:36.643 --> 24:40.397
had some generous regulars.

24:40.605 --> 24:43.692
"Work a little, make a lot,
live my life."

24:43.900 --> 24:46.528
Pre-zombie,
I went to Japan... Twice.

24:47.904 --> 24:50.031
Cambodia, Malta...

24:50.991 --> 24:52.868
I spent three weeks

24:53.076 --> 24:55.412
taking pictures of the Bay
of Kotor in Montenegro.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.372
- So, you took all these?
- Yeah.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.332
Maybe my choices were
different from most people's,

24:59.541 --> 25:02.252
but they were mine.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.796
I liked my life.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.923
And I guess you can't just
get on a plane now, can you?

25:07.132 --> 25:09.092
Even if I could,
my savings are gone.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.303
I get paid in brains.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.182
I have sex for food.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.767
Try living with that
for a while.

25:17.976 --> 25:20.437
And these zombie men have me
whenever they want me.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.522
And...

25:22.731 --> 25:26.359
I spend the rest of my time
hating myself and showering.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.779
So,

25:29.988 --> 25:31.448
if you wouldn't mind
giving me my gun back

25:31.656 --> 25:32.616
and skedaddling...

25:32.824 --> 25:34.159
You don't really
want to do that.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.369
How badly could you
want to die

25:36.536 --> 25:38.788
if you spent an hour
untangling Christmas lights?

25:38.997 --> 25:40.123
I was setting a mood.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.878
Being a zombie hooker
is horrible.

25:47.923 --> 25:49.508
Being a zombie hooker
when you've eaten the brain

25:49.716 --> 25:52.302
of a Benedictine nun?

25:52.511 --> 25:54.137
Or a man with dementia?

25:54.346 --> 25:57.557
That is an extra level
of devastating.

26:00.143 --> 26:02.354
A few weeks ago,
I shot a deer.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.525
I started being a vegan
when I was 16

26:06.733 --> 26:09.152
and hunter-brain made me
kill Bambi.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.907
You have
a zombie girlfriend...

26:14.115 --> 26:16.409
I'm sure you've seen
what these brains do to her.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.495
It's coming
into sharper focus.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.955
I'm either being controlled
by a pimp,

26:20.163 --> 26:21.581
or I'm being
controlled by a brain.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.835
I've had it.

26:28.838 --> 26:29.881
My gun?

26:32.092 --> 26:33.385
What?

26:33.593 --> 26:34.678
Do you want the honors?

27:12.132 --> 27:15.385
Do you know how much Max Rager
I used to drink?

27:15.594 --> 27:18.054
I basically kept them
in business for years.

27:18.263 --> 27:19.639
Then you're part
of the problem.

27:21.933 --> 27:25.312
I'm making my way down this
list as slowly as possible.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.272
I mean, I'm 99% sure that
when I make it to the end,

27:27.480 --> 27:29.566
they'll just kill me
and my girlfriend, too.

27:29.774 --> 27:32.736
Ah, there's gotta be
something you can do.

27:32.944 --> 27:35.280
The guy who owns the company
thinks he walks on water,

27:35.488 --> 27:37.365
that he can charm anyone.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.826
So I'm trying to figure out
a way to use that.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.537
You sound like the sort
of quality boyfriend
I've only heard about.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.914
Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.917
You're doing all of this
to keep your girlfriend safe.

27:48.126 --> 27:49.252
She's got
to appreciate that.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.047
Ah, she doesn't know.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.177
I can't tell her.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.554
Liv would try to stop Vaughn.

27:59.763 --> 28:03.224
I'd end up getting her killed,
and I can't risk that.

28:03.433 --> 28:05.435
I won't risk that.

28:05.644 --> 28:07.228
You know, it's like
a cult over there,

28:07.437 --> 28:09.439
and he is their messiah
offering up immortality
in a can.

28:09.648 --> 28:12.567
I'm working on a plan,
but in the meantime,

28:12.776 --> 28:14.653
I have to keep
abducting zombies,

28:14.861 --> 28:16.655
taking them away
from their families,

28:16.863 --> 28:19.199
and proving
I'm a good soldier,

28:19.407 --> 28:21.701
and I'm pretty sure
that Liv would find that...

28:24.371 --> 28:25.747
...reprehensible.

28:27.999 --> 28:30.460
I know I do.

28:30.669 --> 28:32.921
You're not ripping me away
from my life or loved ones.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.758
I've have no one
and I already want to die.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.262
This should be
your easiest job.

28:45.809 --> 28:48.395
We know a lot
about you, Carlos.

28:48.603 --> 28:52.482
We knew you'd show up
at your cousin's
looking for an insulin fix.

28:52.691 --> 28:55.402
We know you fought
with The Fog on the night
he was murdered.

28:55.610 --> 28:56.778
The woman whose bag
you tried to steal

28:56.986 --> 28:58.655
identified you
from your mugshot.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.658
She told us
The Fog rescued her.

29:01.866 --> 29:05.161
I didn't kill anyone.
I didn't mug anyone neither.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.831
Your so-called mugging victim,
Mary Contreras...

29:08.039 --> 29:10.125
Yeah, I know her name.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.877
She wasn't some school girl
strolling down the street
with her big purse.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.504
So you know,

29:14.713 --> 29:16.756
there was over 50 grand
in that bag...

29:16.965 --> 29:17.924
...none of it hers.

29:18.717 --> 29:19.676
Explain.

29:21.678 --> 29:26.516
She'd just walked into
a high stakes poker game
at Mr. Boss's place,

29:26.725 --> 29:28.518
pulled out a Glock

29:28.727 --> 29:31.146
and robbed some of the city's
most dangerous men
at gunpoint.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.522
<i>We were chasing her
down the street</i>

29:32.731 --> 29:34.149
<i>when we get jumped
by that Fog guy.</i>

29:34.357 --> 29:35.859
I'm The Fog.

29:36.067 --> 29:38.027
And tonight...

29:38.236 --> 29:39.946
I'm thick with justice.

29:46.911 --> 29:48.455
What the hell?

29:55.420 --> 29:57.088
The girl is your killer.

29:57.297 --> 30:00.008
And it's not her first,
won't be her last.

30:00.216 --> 30:02.051
So Mary killed your partner?

30:02.260 --> 30:04.220
She's coming after you
because you're witnesses?

30:04.429 --> 30:07.056
No. That was Mr. Boss.

30:08.892 --> 30:12.020
Me and Jerry were on security
at the poker game.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.396
We screwed up,

30:13.605 --> 30:16.524
and Mr. Boss has a low
tolerance for screw-ups.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.617
It's got a buffer
recoil system.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.035
That way,
when you're shooting,

30:27.243 --> 30:28.495
you don't have to worry
about jerking your neck.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.538
It's kind of a dream.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.999
Unless of course,
you don't like long-range,
accurate shooting.

30:33.208 --> 30:34.709
Now, I showed you mine...

30:41.925 --> 30:43.384
Who the hell are you?

30:46.805 --> 30:47.889
Find her!

30:59.150 --> 31:00.109
Come on.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.312
Okay, seriously...

31:36.521 --> 31:38.439
What are you
supposed to be?

31:41.484 --> 31:43.361
I'm the nightmare
before Christmas.

32:32.243 --> 32:33.870
What are you?

32:34.078 --> 32:36.873
Just a girl in a mask
doing her civic duty.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.375
They were going to kill me.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.296
Call the police.
I'll tie these guys up.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.448
Whatever you are,

33:10.657 --> 33:12.784
I don't want you
coming after me.

33:21.834 --> 33:22.877
You're welcome.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.515
I have a favor to ask.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.183
Anything.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.645
If this doesn't work...

33:40.853 --> 33:42.146
If the cure doesn't happen...

33:42.355 --> 33:43.690
- It's going to.
- But if it doesn't...

33:45.483 --> 33:47.068
I don't want to come back
as a zombie.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.113
Not like this.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.532
And definitely not
like one of those mindless,

33:52.740 --> 33:54.993
drooling monsters
you see in the movies.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.828
There's going to be a cure.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.955
And you'll be sending me
postcards from Tasmania...

33:59.163 --> 34:00.415
But if there isn't...

34:02.500 --> 34:03.793
You'll make sure?

34:05.837 --> 34:06.921
Promise me.

34:10.133 --> 34:11.092
I promise.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.181
So, is this an "in the arm"
kind of thing or?

34:17.390 --> 34:19.142
Uh, the neck is best.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.356
You don't have to worry.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.275
It's not like
it's going to hurt.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.413
Liv.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.540
Liv. You okay?

34:44.417 --> 34:45.460
Judging by the bump
on your head,

34:45.668 --> 34:46.794
you were clocked
pretty good.

34:48.546 --> 34:49.672
Whoa. Slow down.

34:51.883 --> 34:53.718
Did they already arrest
everyone?

34:53.926 --> 34:55.678
Arrest who?

34:55.887 --> 34:58.097
Mr. Boss's thugs.

34:58.306 --> 35:00.308
The guys buying the guns.
Where are the guns?

35:00.516 --> 35:02.477
Did the police take them?

35:02.685 --> 35:04.896
I haven't heard anything
about thugs or guns.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.773
I was called
because of the body.

35:06.981 --> 35:08.316
Mary Contreras.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.901
The mugging victim?

35:10.109 --> 35:11.235
Clive believes she's the one
who killed The Fog.

35:11.444 --> 35:12.445
She was going
to kill me, but...

35:12.653 --> 35:13.863
Mr. Boss to the rescue.

35:14.864 --> 35:16.115
Yeah.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.533
He's also the one
who phoned the police.

35:17.742 --> 35:19.035
He's at the station
with Clive now.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.955
The woman you shot...

35:23.164 --> 35:24.415
I've been told she's been
dropping in

35:24.624 --> 35:26.834
at high stakes poker games,

35:27.043 --> 35:28.920
robbing your friends.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.338
Who told you that?

35:30.546 --> 35:32.590
If that's true, no one
has looped me in.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.927
As I told you, I stopped by
the warehouse
to pick up my Santa suit,

35:36.135 --> 35:38.471
and I saw that woman
about to shoot your partner.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.100
- Liv?
- It's a Christmas miracle!

35:42.308 --> 35:43.392
What did you do with the guns?

35:43.601 --> 35:44.811
I'm sorry? Guns?

35:45.019 --> 35:46.145
There were crates
of.50 caliber rifles.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.647
Your minions
were selling them.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.482
My minions?

35:49.690 --> 35:52.026
I'm a CPA,
I'm not a super-villain.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.987
I don't know anything
about "minions" or guns.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.990
The only illegal activity
going on in my warehouse

35:58.199 --> 35:59.450
was trespassing.

35:59.659 --> 36:00.827
There was a suitcase with
what looked like

36:01.035 --> 36:02.453
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

36:02.662 --> 36:04.705
And visions of sugar plums
danced in her head.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.040
Liv, Mr. Boss says

36:06.249 --> 36:08.167
that Mary Contreras
was about to shoot you.

36:09.085 --> 36:10.086
Is that true?

36:12.255 --> 36:13.214
Liv?

36:13.422 --> 36:14.924
- It's true.
- Well, then...

36:16.717 --> 36:18.594
For what it's worth,

36:18.803 --> 36:21.472
I'm not planning on
pressing charges against her
for trespassing.

36:21.681 --> 36:22.974
It is the holiday season.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.601
It turns me into a big softy.

36:35.695 --> 36:36.946
Let's hit the road.

36:39.490 --> 36:40.741
Where to, boss?

36:40.950 --> 36:42.660
Let's see what Mrs. Claus
is up to.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.624
How can you not get this?
It doesn't matter
what you saw.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.168
You work
for the police department.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.128
You can't storm into a place
without a warrant.

36:52.336 --> 36:54.046
That's why I wore a mask.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.464
Someone needed to take action.

36:55.673 --> 36:57.592
How'd that work out for you?

36:57.800 --> 36:59.468
What if Mr. Boss hadn't
shown up when he did?

36:59.677 --> 37:01.512
Why was he even there?

37:01.721 --> 37:03.139
Don't you think
it's suspicious?

37:05.474 --> 37:07.310
You've done some
crazy stuff before,

37:07.518 --> 37:10.104
but this is too far
over the line.

37:10.313 --> 37:11.772
And that's on me.

37:11.981 --> 37:14.692
You're not a cop and I've been
treating you like one.

37:14.901 --> 37:15.860
Clive...

37:16.068 --> 37:17.069
You and me?

37:18.863 --> 37:20.615
This strange relationship...

37:22.158 --> 37:23.159
It's over.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.663
Clive.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.874
I need this.
This is my one thing.

37:32.376 --> 37:33.502
Sorry, Liv.

37:50.895 --> 37:52.855
Spiced apple cider!

37:53.064 --> 37:54.148
A holiday staple.

37:58.778 --> 38:00.655
I'm not here to fight.

38:00.863 --> 38:02.323
I've done some soul-searching.

38:02.531 --> 38:04.533
And I think I get it now...

38:04.742 --> 38:06.494
You know, the brains,
and how they affect you.

38:07.745 --> 38:09.247
I want to be more empathetic.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.418
You have got blood
in your hair.

38:14.627 --> 38:15.753
Is that a bullet hole?

38:16.754 --> 38:18.172
Hmm.

38:18.381 --> 38:20.341
Shop teacher brain
was a little intense.

38:20.549 --> 38:23.094
Yeah... I saw on the news.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.054
He sidelined
as a superhero.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.474
You know,

38:28.683 --> 38:31.435
maybe there's a way
for you to get brains
that are a little...

38:31.644 --> 38:32.937
...milder.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.106
You know, I was reading
about some research

38:35.314 --> 38:36.732
that's been done
on synthetic brains.

38:36.941 --> 38:38.109
Now, it's a long way off...

38:38.317 --> 38:40.403
I'm not eating
synthetic brains.

38:40.611 --> 38:42.530
Well, they might work
just like regular brains
but without you having to...

38:42.738 --> 38:44.031
What? Serve a purpose?

38:44.907 --> 38:46.617
If I have to eat brains,

38:46.826 --> 38:49.578
I'm helping solve murders
while I'm doing it.

38:49.787 --> 38:52.748
Okay, look, obviously
this brain is affecting you.

38:53.624 --> 38:55.751
There it is.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.421
You think you get it now,
but you just don't.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.967
This isn't the brain, Major.
It's me.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.928
You know, I'm sorry,
but how am I ever supposed
to know which is which?

39:07.555 --> 39:09.640
Can we just be honest
for a moment?

39:11.309 --> 39:14.603
We both know, deep down,
that this can't work.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.149
Being a zombie has changed me.

39:18.357 --> 39:21.110
You love the woman
I was before.

39:21.319 --> 39:23.362
You tolerate the woman
I am now.

39:23.571 --> 39:24.947
Who you are now
is only temporary.

39:25.156 --> 39:26.532
This brain is temporary.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.368
But...

39:29.577 --> 39:32.621
The not being able to
have sex, the day-to-day
personality changes,

39:32.830 --> 39:34.123
that's the new normal.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.377
And that's what neither one
of us is okay with.

39:38.586 --> 39:39.837
We're not.

39:41.505 --> 39:42.757
The truth is,

39:46.052 --> 39:47.678
we belong with our own kind.

39:49.305 --> 39:50.348
Is this...

39:53.809 --> 39:54.977
Are we breaking up?

39:59.190 --> 40:00.399
We have to.

40:14.372 --> 40:16.415
It isn't going to be
like this forever.

40:17.541 --> 40:18.876
Ravi is going to find a cure.

40:20.878 --> 40:22.046
Maybe.

40:26.675 --> 40:27.968
Be careful out there.

40:48.697 --> 40:53.494
The subject maintained
a normal state for 162 days.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.539
The reversion to zombie form
was sudden and complete.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.041
There were no warning signs.

41:00.835 --> 41:03.629
<i>If the cured rat regressed
to zombie form,</i>

41:03.838 --> 41:05.339
<i>it's more than likely
that at some point,</i>

41:05.548 --> 41:07.216
<i>the cured humans will as well.</i>

41:09.927 --> 41:12.430
<i>The reversion also casts doubt</i>

41:12.638 --> 41:16.684
<i>on all working theories
about the cure,</i>

41:16.892 --> 41:19.478
<i>muting whatever hopes
we've been able to muster.</i>

41:20.938 --> 41:24.108
<i>And if hope is indeed lost,</i>

41:24.316 --> 41:26.527
<i>what's left for our zombies
to live for?</i>
