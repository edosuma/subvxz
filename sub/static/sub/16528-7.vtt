  <i> I even made my own version</i>

       to my station wagon?

00:28.095 --> 00:30.062
    Isn't it great?
    I turned it into
    G.I.T.T.,

   You know I would
   literally die

06:24.952 --> 06:27.819
 if I didn't have
 all my children
 here for Thanksgiving.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.687
 Is that what you want...

06:28.689 --> 06:31.089
   To bury your mother
   on Thanksgiving?

06:31.091 --> 06:31.790
                     Yes!

06:31.792 --> 06:33.658
          Lainey's dad inviting
          me to his house

06:33.660 --> 06:36.728
        is the first clear sign
        that he's given up
        on hating my guts!

06:36.730 --> 06:39.664
 Boopie, now you have
 the best of both worlds.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.833
    You can have dinner
    with Lainey's family

06:41.835 --> 06:43.735
 and with your actual family,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.271
 who means so much more
 than those other people.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.139
        (DOORBELL RINGS)

06:47.141 --> 06:49.808
    Hello. Welcome
    to a Goldberg Thanks...

06:49.810 --> 06:52.010
             Gangway, gangway!
             Have no fear,

06:52.012 --> 06:54.279
    the Thanksgiving cavalry
    is here!

06:54.281 --> 06:56.281
 Um, no, no, no,
 no, no, no!

06:56.283 --> 06:59.017
 Bill, I told you,
 you didn't have to
 bring anything.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.085
        Oh, please! As a guest,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.554
           it's my job to bring
           you a few snacks.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.356
                 Main course.
                 Also six pies.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.559
 That is so sweet.
 (CHUCKLES) Really, but no.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.194
    (CHUCKLES)
    We're covered on food,

07:09.196 --> 07:10.629
   and I'm about to put
   my turkey in the oven.

07:10.631 --> 07:14.366
      Oven? Well, I guess
      that's one less delicious
      way to do it.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.867
      Dad, you promised
      to keep it breezy.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.069
              That's me...
              Easy-breezy Bill,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.205
        and he says it can't be
        Thanksgiving

07:20.207 --> 07:22.474
             without his famous
             fried turkey.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.309
     Fried? (LAUGHS)

07:24.311 --> 07:27.212
       Never had a Thanksgiving
       without my fryer.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.347
               So, you know...

07:34.254 --> 07:35.120
 Do something?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.254
             How about we serve
             both of them?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.223
               Great idea, son.
     You called me son.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.026
         Yes, thank you,
         my actual son.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.794
          (LAUGHS)
          Double birds.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.462
        Makes total sense.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.764
              Huge Thanksgiving
              announcement,
              Bill and Lainey.

07:45.766 --> 07:49.267
   I won't be eating turkey
   this year for moral reasons.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.735
   What's her deal?

07:50.737 --> 07:51.403
       Get out of here!

07:51.405 --> 07:52.904
     No one has time for
     your thing this year.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.540
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> While Thanksgiving was off</i>
  <i> to a competitive start,</i>

07:55.542 --> 07:57.976
     <i> I was realizing</i>
     <i> I lost out big time.</i>

07:57.978 --> 08:00.545
<i> I seemed to be the only person</i>
<i> in all of Philadelphia</i>

08:00.547 --> 08:02.547
  <i> who wasn't seeing K.I.T.T.</i>
  <i> that day.</i>

08:02.549 --> 08:04.683
       Oh, man.
       I wish I was there.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.584
     ADULT ADAM: <i> Literally.</i>

08:05.586 --> 08:08.987
         <i> Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>
               <i> Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

08:09.356 --> 08:10.288
     What the hell is that?

08:10.290 --> 08:12.424
   It looks your father
   and your uncle

08:12.426 --> 08:14.459
     doing the thing
     you wanted to do...

08:14.461 --> 08:16.294
       I know what it is, Pops!

08:17.564 --> 08:18.463
        Whoo!

08:18.465 --> 08:20.065
              That was amazing.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.434
    Who would've enjoyed
    this more than us?

08:22.436 --> 08:23.702
      No one, that's who!

08:23.704 --> 08:24.903
      ADULT ADAM:
     <i> There was someone...</i>

08:24.905 --> 08:26.605
       <i> A spiteful dork</i>
       <i> in a puffer vest</i>

08:26.607 --> 08:29.107
       <i> ready to unleash</i>
       <i> pure nerd rage.</i>

08:29.109 --> 08:30.041
         You!

08:30.043 --> 08:31.042
           What are you doing?

08:31.044 --> 08:31.943
      I got to pull the car in!

08:31.945 --> 08:34.645
  How could you two
  see K.I.T.T. without me?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.914
           Calm down. How was I
           supposed to know

08:36.917 --> 08:38.683
            you wanted to see
            the awesome TV car?

08:38.684 --> 08:41.186
  'Cause I'm the one
  who told you about it!

08:41.188 --> 08:43.621
           Ah. That's where
           I heard that.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.791
          In my defense,
          you're always talking
          about these He-Mans,

08:46.793 --> 08:50.595
 these robots, and these Trons,
 they all kind of
 blur together.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.597
       You're confusing
       sci-fi fantasy

08:52.599 --> 08:54.766
     with reality-based
     sci-fi action.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.201
 You're embarrassing yourself!

08:56.203 --> 08:58.970
        Listen, kid, if it's
        any consolation,

08:58.972 --> 09:00.138
        you were totally right.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.440
           Meeting K.I.T.T.
           in person...

09:02.442 --> 09:03.441
   It was, like, life-changing.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.710
     It w... It was better
     than you could ever think!

09:05.712 --> 09:08.947
 That's not a consolation!
 That's rubbing my face in it!

09:08.949 --> 09:12.150
    Look, I know it meant a lot
    to you, so it's on me.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.518
            And?
              And, uh...

09:13.520 --> 09:14.886
            We should just
            move past this.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.787
             No!
               Hey! Hey!

09:15.789 --> 09:19.224
      Your father is opening up
      his heart to you, Adam.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.927
            You should be
            more sensitive
            to his feelings.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.528
       It's Thanksgiving, man!

09:23.530 --> 09:25.196
     Kids, huh?
              Unbelievable.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.432
 Fine! You want...
 You want to see bad?

09:27.634 --> 09:30.802
      Mark my words,
      vengeance will be...

09:30.804 --> 09:32.971
  Oh, man, this thing's fast!

09:32.973 --> 09:35.006
    (QUICKLY)
    Vengeance will be mine!

09:35.142 --> 09:37.242
    Ew, there's a spider here!

09:38.645 --> 09:39.911
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> It was still Thanksgiving,</i>

09:39.913 --> 09:41.446
   <i> and I was going to dish</i>
   <i> some sweet revenge</i>

09:41.448 --> 09:44.182
 <i> by turning my dad and uncle</i>
 <i> against each other.</i>

09:44.184 --> 09:46.084
 Come on,
 they're getting along.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.888
    Don't take that
    away from them over
    some singing boat.

09:49.890 --> 09:50.989
               Talking car.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.857
   Enough with
   this meshuggaas.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.060
       Dad and Uncle Marvin
       think they can just take

09:55.062 --> 09:56.962
           my favorite TV show?
           (LAUGHS)

09:56.964 --> 10:01.266
           We'll see about that
           when I unleash
           the power of this.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.500
     A fun kid's game?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.201
              Ages 8 and up,

10:03.203 --> 10:06.538
       and guaranteed to turn
       my uncle against my dad.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.307
       That's it, we are
       officially not brothers!

10:09.309 --> 10:10.375
             Guys, relax.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.644
           All I said was
           only one person

10:12.646 --> 10:14.646
       could be
       the Michael Knight
       game piece.

10:14.648 --> 10:18.750
   We just have to figure out
   which one of you
   is not the hero.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.351
     I'm the Hoff!

10:19.353 --> 10:21.553
             If anyone is
             Michael Knight,
             it's me!

10:21.555 --> 10:23.989
   Be the car!
   You love the car!

10:23.991 --> 10:28.593
       You think that I would
       ever let you ride in me?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.128
               Oh-ho-ho!

10:30.130 --> 10:31.563
            I ride in you!

10:31.565 --> 10:33.965
           Oh, this is, like,
           crazy awkward.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.101
           We can't have two
           Michael Knights.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.535
           This is just like
           when we were kids

10:37.537 --> 10:40.238
    and you always wanted to be
    the Lone Ranger,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.574
              and you forced me
              to be Tonto!

10:42.576 --> 10:43.642
   You loved Tonto!

10:43.644 --> 10:44.876
  Why don't you both discuss

10:44.878 --> 10:46.544
     the childhood betrayal
     in detail?

10:46.546 --> 10:49.080
          I always wanted to be
          the Lone Ranger,

10:49.082 --> 10:50.715
           but now I proved you
           wrong!

10:50.717 --> 10:52.217
                I'm a cop!
   You're not a cop!

10:52.219 --> 10:55.353
 You just guard the fountain
 where the bored dads sit.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.588
         Ouch. Attacking you
         as a person.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.958
         Well, you know
         everything there is
         to know about sitting,

10:59.960 --> 11:00.558
             don't you, Mur?

11:00.560 --> 11:04.529
         Because that's all you
         ever do, you lazy ass!

11:04.531 --> 11:06.431
   Well, I'm walking now!

11:06.433 --> 11:07.165
   Look at this!

11:07.167 --> 11:09.868
           You can't storm out!
           That's my move!

11:09.870 --> 11:11.603
          He is the worst, huh?

11:11.605 --> 11:13.004
            Know what'll really
            piss him off?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.306
   I don't. Tell me.
   Say it!

11:15.308 --> 11:17.642
       A picture of you sitting
       in the real K.I.T.T.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.244
             That would prove
             you're the Hoff.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.879
 Hey!
 The mall where I work...

11:20.881 --> 11:23.415
 That's where they're
 storing all the
 Thanksgiving Day floats...

11:23.417 --> 11:26.918
  K.I.T.T. included!
  Let's go there now.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.119
         What a brilliant idea,

11:28.121 --> 11:30.388
             which you had with
             no help from me.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.624
             Here's your jacket
             and car keys!

11:32.626 --> 11:33.191
                Let's jam!

11:33.193 --> 11:34.592
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> As my plan was heating up,</i>

11:34.594 --> 11:38.163
 <i> things were getting frostier</i>
 <i> between Bill and my mom.</i>

11:38.165 --> 11:39.597
     <i> Excusez-moi.</i>

11:39.599 --> 11:41.199
           Okay, Bill, if you
           could just stay

11:41.201 --> 11:44.169
 in your designated area,
 I would appreciate it.

11:44.171 --> 11:44.936
           Oh, my bad. You see,

11:44.938 --> 11:47.072
       when you're a pro
       at Thanksgiving like me,

11:47.074 --> 11:48.039
       cooking is like jazz.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.874
         You just go where
         it takes you.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.443
            (SCATTING)

11:51.445 --> 11:52.177
               Salt.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.546
        No one likes jazz,
        okay? No one.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.715
   Oh, well, maybe we should do
   a little Pepsi Challenge.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.250
    Put our birds side by side.
    Winner takes all!

11:59.252 --> 12:01.553
         We're not having
         a cook-off, okay?

12:01.555 --> 12:02.754
   You're a guest in my home.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.222
    I couldn't embarrass you
    like that.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.423
          Ooh! Sounds like
          someone's scared.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.393
    Maybe you should be cooking
    a chicken instead! (CLUCKS)

12:08.395 --> 12:10.762
    Okay, now he's taunting her
    with the chicken squawk.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.964
                   This is bad.
 Don't sweat it, babe.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.401
 Big Tasty is the master
 at defusing tension.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.402
       There's a line.
                  Excuse me.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.670
         Stop it.
       I'm gonna just help you.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.505
  Mom. Bill.
  It's Thanksgiving.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.640
 And me and Lainey
 both think...

12:22.642 --> 12:24.609
 Oh, sweet god of food,

12:24.611 --> 12:26.978

 right now?

       meant to say

12:33.854 --> 12:35.420
    was let's not make today
    a competition.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.055
      It's not what
      the holiday's about.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.056

        Don't care.

             winners or losers.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.560
     Don't look at me.
         You're right.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.995
       Shame on us
       for competing over

12:43.997 --> 12:45.497
         who cares more
         about Thanksgiving.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.898
         Although, if it was
         a competition,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.033
      clearly I'd win because
      I'm a single dad

12:49.035 --> 12:50.435
           and this day
           is all I got.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.102
   Oh, would you win, though?

12:51.104 --> 12:54.038
         'Cause I'm the one
         with three kids about
         to leave the nest

12:54.040 --> 12:55.640
           and pretty soon
           it'll just be
           me and Murray

12:55.642 --> 13:00.578
 staring silently at each other
 across a long table thinking,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.413
       "Is this all there is?"

13:02.415 --> 13:02.814
            Sad story, Bev.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.216
       But not as sad
       as the Thanksgiving when
       Lainey's mommy left.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.585
 Which isn't important,
 'cause it's not a competition.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.153
               No, it isn't.

            matter that I
            tell you that year

13:10.023 --> 13:11.790
            I was too depressed
            to cook.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.758

        at me and said,

             In that moment,

13:16.596 --> 13:18.663

             I would always
             fry her a turkey.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.365
  Okay, now you're both
  just competing

13:20.367 --> 13:21.599

13:21.601 --> 13:24.035
        Oh, you want sad?
        I'll give you sad.

 to your stupid

13:33.914 --> 13:35.914
       May the best turkey win.
           Which is mine!

     I had to be the boss.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.517
  <i> � I'll always be there...</i>

18:39.519 --> 18:42.120
        Yeah, well, I'm sure
        it wasn't easy.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.020
<i> � But when you're in doubt...</i>

18:43.022 --> 18:45.056
    Point is, I should have
    given you the chance

18:45.058 --> 18:46.724
  to be the Lone Ranger, too.

18:46.726 --> 18:47.959
 <i> � And when you're in danger</i>

18:47.961 --> 18:49.260
         Thanks, man,
         that means a lot.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.862
     Well, you can still
     be the Hoff.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.697
   <i> � Take a look all around</i>
       It's up to you.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.565
 You know, you're the one
 who's the cop.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.401
    <i> � And I'll be there</i>
         (VOICE BREAKING)
         Aw, Mur.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.538
     You're choking me up here.
 That was not my intention.

19:00.540 --> 19:00.905
                  Bring it in.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.141
    No, hugging in a car...
   <i> � Of the right words to say</i>

19:03.143 --> 19:05.109
 No, I... I... Okay.
            (GROANS) Oh, buddy.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.078
 <i> � I know they don't sound</i>
 <i> the way I planned them to be</i>

19:07.080 --> 19:09.147
           <i> � Promise</i>
       <i> � But if you wait</i>
       <i> around a while</i>

19:09.149 --> 19:10.081
        What's going on
        out there?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.517
             Dad apologized
             to Uncle Marvin.
       <i> � I promise</i>

19:12.519 --> 19:13.951
              No.
  <i> � I promise you I will</i>

19:13.953 --> 19:16.154
            I guess that's what
            today's about...

19:16.156 --> 19:18.489
      Being thankful for
      the people that are here,

19:18.491 --> 19:20.358
               even if they
               drive you crazy.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.058
  ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>

19:21.060 --> 19:25.096
  <i> my mom realized she could</i>
  <i> still save Thanksgiving.</i>

19:25.365 --> 19:28.432
      Well, well,
      it's the turkey saboteur.

19:28.434 --> 19:31.269
    I deserve that.
    But I, uh...

19:31.271 --> 19:35.273
 Just wanted to tell you
 that you win.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.275
                   I do?
          Yes.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.911
  Your Thanksgivings
  were way sadder.

19:39.913 --> 19:44.582
 And I realize that as much
 as the holiday means to me,

19:44.584 --> 19:46.083
   it means way more
   to you.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.084
      <i> � But if you wait</i>
      <i> around a while</i>

19:47.086 --> 19:49.921
    Listen, I just wasn't ready
    to change up Thanksgiving.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.355
     <i> � I promise</i>
     <i> I promise you I will</i>

19:51.357 --> 19:52.823
               It's always been
               me and Lainey.

19:52.825 --> 19:53.891
    <i> � I'm sorry,</i>
    <i> but I'm just thinking</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:56.093
 <i> � Of the right words to say</i>
              She's all I have.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.462
 And now you have us, too.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.231
 And we can figure out

20:00.233 --> 20:03.167
 how to have the best
 Thanksgiving for both of us.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.602
  <i> � I'd make you fall for me</i>

20:04.604 --> 20:05.803
     <i> � I promise you</i>
     <i> I promise you I will</i>

20:05.805 --> 20:09.473
     ADULT ADAM: <i> That year,</i>
    <i> our Thanksgiving</i>
    <i> got a little bigger.</i>

20:09.475 --> 20:09.840
         Okay, folks,

20:09.842 --> 20:12.243
  Bev and I aren't quite sure
  what this will be like,

20:12.245 --> 20:13.978
    but it's her seasonings
    and a little bit

20:13.980 --> 20:16.714
 of Lewis frying know-how.
 Dig in!

20:16.816 --> 20:19.050
      Holy crap,
      that's amazing!
 <i> � Of the right words to say</i>

20:19.052 --> 20:21.152
      What happened to
      your vegetable thing?

20:21.154 --> 20:22.386
   Eh, I'll try it again
   next year

20:22.388 --> 20:24.922
 when everyone doesn't have
 as much stuff going on.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.159
  ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> doesn't matter</i>
<i> what kind of turkey you cook.</i>

20:28.161 --> 20:29.760
      And a Happy Thanksgiving,
      everyone.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.397
  Happy Thanksgiving, you guys.
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> Or what table you sit at.</i>

20:33.399 --> 20:35.633
       <i> It's the people</i>
       <i> who you welcome</i>
       <i> into your home</i>

20:35.635 --> 20:37.969
      <i> and your heart</i>
      <i> who really matter.</i>
          <i> � I will</i>

20:37.971 --> 20:41.606
  <i> And that's something to be</i>
  <i> truly thankful for.</i>

20:41.608 --> 20:43.341
           <i> � I will</i>

20:43.343 --> 20:45.042
          <i> � I will �</i>

20:47.614 --> 20:49.146
           (LAUGHTER)
     MAN: Go!

20:50.617 --> 20:52.650
        (TURKEY SIZZLING)

20:58.157 --> 20:59.657
 (SIGHS) Being
 a vegetarian sucked.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.393
 Honestly, I was just
 looking for something
 to distract me

21:02.395 --> 21:04.629
 from thinking about
 Geoff all the time.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.796
               No freakin' way!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.798
 Hey, Geoff!
 Look, it's Geoff!

21:07.800 --> 21:09.267
            I thought Barry
            was messing with me

21:09.269 --> 21:10.268
            when he said
            K.I.T.T. was here.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.102
            <i> Knight Rider</i> is
             my favorite show!

21:11.104 --> 21:15.606
 Mine too!
 I love the knights
 and horses and swords.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.841
     Maybe don't talk
     until you've seen it.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.743
 We should take her
 for a spin together!

21:18.745 --> 21:20.645
 Uh, maybe grab a burger,
 just me and you?

21:20.647 --> 21:23.781
         Oh, my God, yes!
         We can swing by Evy's
         house and pick her up!

21:23.783 --> 21:24.348
              She's gonna flip!

21:24.350 --> 21:26.450
              That's not how
              you wanted it
              to work, huh?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.485
 Yeah, really not my week.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.188
          K.I.T.T.,
          pick up girlfriend.
          (LAUGHS)
