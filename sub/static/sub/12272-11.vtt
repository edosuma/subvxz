WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:11.850
And the rockets' red glare
the bombs bursting in air

00:11.890 --> 00:22.890
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there

00:22.940 --> 00:37.230
o,say,does that
star-spangled banner yet wave

00:37.270 --> 00:53.740
o'er the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.120
Welcome to pbr finals in las vegas.

02:03.170 --> 02:07.360
For two weekends,we have 45 riders
competing in a race for the world title.

02:07.410 --> 02:10.039
The world champion goes
home with a million bucks.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.830
You want to talk about pressure?

02:11.850 --> 02:13.810
It's all in las vegas.

02:13.870 --> 02:20.460
Next up,cody latshaw riding wintwister,

02:20.510 --> 02:22.430
*****a champ among champions.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.920
ready?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.840
hold on wait a minute

02:47.930 --> 02:49.360
easy, Cody.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.500
Hey,cody,you all right?

02:55.540 --> 02:56.240
You okay?

02:56.290 --> 02:57.060
Get a stretcher.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.330
Get a stretcher!

02:58.370 --> 02:59.570
I don't need a stretcher.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.240
- You sure?
- I'm okay.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.130
Just give me a hand.

03:02.170 --> 03:03.800
All right. Here we go.

03:09.010 --> 03:10.280
re-ride!

03:10.410 --> 03:15.000
*****

03:15.030 --> 03:18.650
This is why we call him
lazarus,ladies and gentlemen.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.570
Knock him down,and he rises again.

03:21.620 --> 03:22.720
What an athlete!

03:22.750 --> 03:25.120
What a hero!

03:35.950 --> 03:36.800
So,who found him?

03:36.840 --> 03:37.880
Security.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.090
We have a tough time finding
guys to wrangle a bull.

03:41.130 --> 03:44.100
Cowboys like to party
when they come to vegas.

03:44.710 --> 03:46.060
Did you see anything?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.870
No,we just put the bull back in the pen.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.310
Ty murray,pbr presid T.

03:51.340 --> 03:52.780
En and seven-time world champ.

03:52.850 --> 03:53.650
Okay,dustin.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.520
- Jim brass,vegas pd.
- Nice to meet you.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.750
Gil grissom,crime lab.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.410
Nice to meet you.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.790
What can you tell me about this guy?

03:59.850 --> 04:02.280
Cody latshaw,a real institution.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.980
Most guys his age hung up
their rope a long time ago.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.200
What about the bull?

04:06.240 --> 04:10.560
Wintwister-- he threw cody earlier
tonight,but he got up and was fine.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.000
He even asked for a re-ride.

04:12.040 --> 04:12.900
"Re-ride"?

04:12.940 --> 04:16.490
Well,if a bull doesn't buck good
enough,they can ask to get on another one.

04:16.529 --> 04:19.180
That wasn't the case.
Wintwister had a good day.

04:19.209 --> 04:23.810
Cody must not have been in his right
mind to think he'd get a second shot.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.430
Is this the rope they
tie around the bull?

04:26.480 --> 04:27.310
That's one of them.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.980
That's the bull rope.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.010
Looks like it's got rosin on it.

04:34.070 --> 04:37.490
Yeah,it helps the rope stick to the
glove so they can get a good grip.

04:37.530 --> 04:39.640
Do all the riders wear a glove?

04:39.690 --> 04:40.960
Yes,sir.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.890
He's not wearing one.

04:46.650 --> 04:49.020
Guy was living the american dream.

04:49.650 --> 04:52.880
Every kid wants to
grow up to be a cowboy.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.050
Not a dead cowboy.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.960
catherine.

05:37.690 --> 05:39.020
Hi.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.090
Pbr sports medicine just sent this over.

05:43.140 --> 05:46.400
Taken after cody's fall in competition.

05:50.050 --> 05:54.570
He was held together by every
kind of hardware but roofing nails.

05:54.630 --> 05:55.730
I can relate.

05:55.790 --> 05:56.770
Yeah,it's a violent sport.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.530
Check out his hand.

05:58.910 --> 06:02.450
Riders live with constant
injuries and pain.

06:02.520 --> 06:08.770
They always get on that next bull and try like
hell to hang on for the next eight seconds.

06:08.810 --> 06:10.490
You sound like a fan.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.380
I used to date a bull rider.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.830
Cowboy up.

06:14.870 --> 06:15.970
- Here you go.
- Hey.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.010
These are the ones I took.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.210
Thank you.

06:18.820 --> 06:20.890
So there's just a few
bills in his pockets.

06:20.950 --> 06:22.250
David,why don't you give me a hand here?

06:22.280 --> 06:23.160
Oh,sure.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.730
Some guys keep valuables in their boots.

06:29.410 --> 06:32.140
Cody's little doggies
are right fragrant.

06:32.190 --> 06:34.430
Catherine,take a look at this.

06:37.860 --> 06:44.170
This x-ray shows he walked away from his earlier
fall with a hairline fracture of the c1 vertebra.

06:50.530 --> 06:55.930
in bull riding,the rider's spine must sustain
vertical,horizontal and diagonal thrust,

06:55.960 --> 07:00.110
together if they put tremendous
force onto the spinal column.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.770
that guy was a walking time bomb.

07:18.060 --> 07:23.020
Any trauma with sufficient force would snap
that vertebra and sever the spinal cord.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.010
It did.

07:24.050 --> 07:28.350
The film david just took
shows a complete fracture.

07:29.370 --> 07:30.440
That's your cod.

07:30.490 --> 07:33.800
Consistent with getting
thrown a second time.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.400
hey

07:35.430 --> 07:38.540
You got anything to do with taking
my bull off tomorrow's day sheet?

07:38.600 --> 07:39.570
Do you own the bull?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.580
Yeah,I'm nancy twicker.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.010
And I want my bull in the finals.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.520
The more he bucks,the more he's worth.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.330
So whatever you got to do
to clear him,get it done.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.200
Your bull gave cody latshaw
a pretty brutal beating.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.670
It's not the bull's fault.

07:52.710 --> 07:55.350
I blame cody for taking
him out after hours.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.120
Is it true that some riders tie the
bull's testicles to get them to buck more?

07:59.170 --> 08:01.050
Well,sure,we always
want the bulls to buck.

08:01.090 --> 08:02.950
That's why we tie a flank
strap across their back.

08:03.010 --> 08:04.330
They're trying to shake it off.

08:04.390 --> 08:05.210
Think about it.

08:05.240 --> 08:10.620
If I tied a rope around your testicles,would
you feel like jumping up and down?

08:12.250 --> 08:14.920
Could a guy get a bull out of
this chute without any help?

08:14.980 --> 08:17.660
Well,one guy could get a bull all
the way to the bucking chute,sure,

08:17.700 --> 08:22.200
but well,then he'd have to tie on
the bull rope and the flank strap.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.770
Then he'd have to get on the bull.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.090
And open the gate.

08:25.150 --> 08:26.440
Not without help.

08:26.490 --> 08:28.630
The chute only ope ns from the outside.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.309
I'm going to need to process your bull.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.470
Can you do it in eight seconds?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.830
Even confined like this,these are
not the most cooperative creatures.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.330
So if my flank man
says get back,you jump.

08:42.370 --> 08:43.520
Hey,cash.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.730
Howdy,cash dooley.

08:46.810 --> 08:48.510
And my name's about the only cash I got.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.790
And this is wintwister?

08:52.100 --> 08:54.070
What,uh...

08:54.130 --> 08:57.030
what would be the safest way
for me to handle his hooves?

08:57.080 --> 08:57.990
There ain't one.

08:58.050 --> 08:59.040
Too dangerous.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.020
He's a kicker.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.470
Do you think I could get
him to step on something?

09:02.530 --> 09:03.760
Sure.

09:03.790 --> 09:06.060
But you better let me do the bending.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.320
Think you could get him to step on this?

09:16.140 --> 09:18.310
Cash knols bulws like nobody.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.580
Heck,before these kids could even walk,

09:19.590 --> 09:22.210
they're out riding sheep,then
calves and baby bulls.

09:22.220 --> 09:26.710
And finally these one-ton,back-jerkin'
snot-slingin' monsters.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.830
Now,they get all busted
up and quit ridin',

09:28.840 --> 09:31.170
but they just can't quit these animals.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.230
Cotton fiber.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.380
Appears to be bloodstained.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.390
I need another piece for comparison.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.880
Forget how to use the scissors?

09:52.890 --> 09:55.750
Put your fingers in
the holes and squeeze.

09:57.070 --> 09:58.920
Yes,ma'am.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.460
This looks like semen.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.860
Cowboy had a roll in the hay.

10:14.600 --> 10:19.390
Either he's messy or,uh,we could
have a brokeback mountain situation.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.500
Oh,god,that movie made me cry.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.180
Me,too.

10:24.470 --> 10:27.680
You know,it takes a
big man to admit that.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.260
And I am that man.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.870
You don't say?

10:32.750 --> 10:36.420
Fibers from the bull are
consistent with cody's shirt.

10:37.650 --> 10:39.930
Looks like wintwister's a killer.

10:54.470 --> 10:59.820
found her body on patrol,called
in the 401ab,apparent fatal.

11:00.510 --> 11:02.810
If there were any eyewitnesses,they
didn't stick around.

11:04.010 --> 11:06.010
Okay,thanks.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.760
Here's the point of impact.

11:23.540 --> 11:27.270
Threw her that far,he must
have been going at least...

11:28.360 --> 11:31.620
Tiffany rigdon,27,local.

11:31.630 --> 11:33.160
I'll run her for you.

11:33.490 --> 11:34.610
Thanks.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.990
Radiator fluid.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.700
Bunch of empty liquor miniatures.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.800
Card key from pike's gambling hall.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.300
hit-and-run.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.820
Hit back there...

12:05.060 --> 12:07.230
ran over here.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.220
Ro is cody latshaw--
durant,oklahoma.

12:38.230 --> 12:40.780
- Isn't that grissom's dead cowboy?
- Yeah.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.650
Boy,he had a hell of a night.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.490
He gets humiliated...

12:47.960 --> 12:49.770
hits a pedestrian...

12:51.660 --> 12:55.840
he ditches the car,walks a couple of
blocks to the arena,joyrides a bull,

12:55.850 --> 12:58.570
and then ends up
getting stomped to death?

13:01.130 --> 13:04.820
Here's another card key from
pike's gambling hall right here.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.720
First one's for room
810,registered to cody latshaw.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.590
Here you go.

13:20.510 --> 13:23.010
Second one's also to room 810.

13:23.020 --> 13:26.310
*********

13:29.620 --> 13:31.680
Cody knew the girl he ran over.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.780
Lucky for us,housekeeping's
a little slow on the uptake.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.370
Riding glove.

13:54.380 --> 13:58.550
So he wasn't planning on re-riding
wintwister when he left here.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.550
Threw back a bunch of beers,some liquor.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.620
I don't see any drugs.

14:05.530 --> 14:08.790
Bed looks used. Maybe
he partied with tiffany.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.270
Bet it cost him.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.570
I ran her priors. She's got
a couple for solicitation.

14:17.250 --> 14:21.590
"I can't help now but wonder "what
your brown eyes were concealing.

14:21.600 --> 14:26.880
"They just showed me reflections
of all that I was feeling...

14:27.220 --> 14:32.110
"our bodies close together
like my ride hand in my glove.

14:32.330 --> 14:37.560
"Hearts pounding with excitement
and,dare I say it,love."

14:40.090 --> 14:42.010
Nobody ever wrote me a poem.

14:42.020 --> 14:45.710
"I know I'll never own you.
"It's your nature to run free,"

14:45.720 --> 14:50.100
but I pray the lord above that
one day you'll come back to me.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.000
" that's sweet.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.610
"By the time you read this,I'll
be married. "He's a great guy.

14:57.620 --> 15:01.860
"Honest,cody,I'll always be thankful
"for everything you did for me.

15:01.870 --> 15:03.940
"Love,tiffany.

15:03.950 --> 15:06.810
" Sounds like it was more
than a money relationship.

15:08.090 --> 15:10.780
Broken bones-- he gets
up and rides again.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.430
Broken heart and he's a killer.

15:18.620 --> 15:22.250
"Then we'll ride off in
glory until our time "is done

15:22.260 --> 15:26.230
and I will be your
hero,your cowboy in the sun."

15:26.570 --> 15:28.220
It's not shakespeare.

15:28.730 --> 15:31.070
I'm actually a fan of cowboy poetry.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.010
Are you really?

15:32.020 --> 15:36.270
Yeah,it's just a way of organizing your thoughts
and feelin gs so that you can make sense of them.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.690
Well,it sounds like cody was trying to
make sense out of his girl leaving him.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.000
Yeah,well,poetry can
help you with that,too.

15:46.920 --> 15:51.560
Rib fractures,multiple
lacerations,pulmonary contusions,

15:51.570 --> 15:53.910
lacerated aorta,lacerated liver.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.050
I could go on,but you get the idea.

15:56.060 --> 15:58.560
Cod was multiple blunt force trauma.

15:58.570 --> 16:01.910
Right,but not all of it
was from the hit-and-run.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.900
You see the coloration of the bruises?

16:05.910 --> 16:07.420
Yellowish.

16:07.430 --> 16:11.540
They're from an event at least
12 hours before the accident.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.640
Maybe cody had rejection issues.

16:15.650 --> 16:18.110
Could be why she was leaving him.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.240
Sanders: Lot of tools back here.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.610
It's an equipment
- intensive sport.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.830
What have we here?

16:45.720 --> 16:47.840
Some kind of cattle prod?

16:47.850 --> 16:51.130
They don't use those in
professional bull riding.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.790
Buckaroos,have you seen catherine?

16:53.800 --> 16:57.700
'Cause I just got the results from that
semen stain on cody latshaw's jeans.

16:57.710 --> 16:58.940
Come up with a match?

16:58.950 --> 16:59.870
I did.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.470
I had to run an ouchterlony test on it.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.680
So not from a human donor?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.819
No... no.

17:06.829 --> 17:08.470
Bovine.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.940
Yeah...

17:09.950 --> 17:14.130
I took a psychobiology class once and
we studied a very interesting case.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.800
Okay,there was a guy,he lived on
a farm,and literally the only way

17:16.810 --> 17:20.380
that this guy could get sexually
satisfied was when he was with livestock.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.329
That's okay. I'm good.

17:21.339 --> 17:25.500
Well,see,apparently,the whole thing started one
night because he was in the barn-- it started snowing.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.400
He got stuck in there.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.569
He couldn't make his way
back to the farmhouse,

17:28.580 --> 17:31.670
so he decided that he
would try and stay warm...

17:31.680 --> 17:34.170
well,with a sheep.

17:35.090 --> 17:37.470
But then the horses were jealous,so...

17:37.480 --> 17:40.510
you know,and i think there
was a cow in there as well.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.000
You know,I think we got the picture.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.820
I wish I didn'T.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.820
I think I know what this is for.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.280
It's called an electroejaculator.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.600
It's used on bulls
that have back trouble.

17:56.610 --> 17:59.790
- It looks,uh...pretty persuasive.
- Yeah.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.270
So,uh,was cody helping you
collect from wintwister?

18:03.280 --> 18:04.300
Hell,no.First of all,

18:04.310 --> 18:06.880
you don't collect during competition.

18:06.890 --> 18:08.970
Right,right,so like an
athlete before a game.

18:08.980 --> 18:09.930
Now you're talking.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.220
And when I do collect,I bring
a service out to the ranch.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.720
You know,one collection from
that old boy gives you about...

18:14.730 --> 18:16.020
500 breeding units.

18:16.030 --> 18:18.320
At a hundred bucks a
pop,you do the math.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.190
Well,if the stuff is so valuable,maybe
cody was doing a little moonlighting,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.250
you know,collecting on his
own,making a little extra money.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.730
Cattle rustling? No,not cody.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.180
We found bull semen on his jeans.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.940
Cody wouldn't steal from me.

18:28.950 --> 18:32.110
Besides,it's a two-person job,no
matter which method you use.

18:32.340 --> 18:33.540
There's more than one?

18:33.550 --> 18:38.480
In addition to your electroejaculation,you
got what's called an artificial vagina.

18:38.490 --> 18:41.180
Now,you get a teaser animal
in there,like a steer.

18:41.190 --> 18:44.140
See,bulls go homosexual in captivity.

18:44.150 --> 18:47.230
You get that bull to mount that steer,then
you get that av in there right before th...

18:47.240 --> 18:49.550
yeah,I get the point.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.770
Do you know this girl?

18:51.780 --> 18:54.740
- We think she's cody's girlfriend.
- Yeah.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.000
I thought he had a new girlfriend in
vegas from the way his mood was changing.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.100
She's younger,probably...

19:02.110 --> 19:04.190
does whatever he says.

19:05.450 --> 19:08.240
Listen,if you need anything
else,I'll be at the arena all day.

19:08.250 --> 19:11.110
I thought wintwister
didn't compete tonight.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.270
Well,captain,I'm not
a one-bull kind of gal.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.450
Here you are,sir.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.180
Can I help you?

19:23.190 --> 19:25.660
Saw a woman get killed last night.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
Hey,cath,listen,it's jim.

19:27.130 --> 19:31.560
We got an eyewitness confirming that
tiffany's tod was after 2:21 A.M.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.770
Well,that's over an hour
after cody's body was found.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.470
Thanks,jim.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.500
I got prints from the truck,but
half of them are cody'S.

19:41.510 --> 19:42.880
Well,it is his truck.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.000
So... get this.

19:44.010 --> 19:47.680
There's a witness that puts
tiffany's tod after cody'S.

19:47.690 --> 19:49.120
He didn't kill her.

19:49.630 --> 19:51.140
I think he had a partner.

19:51.150 --> 19:54.320
There's a set of unknowns both
on the truck and on the,uh...

19:54.330 --> 19:55.960
electro-love machine.

19:56.040 --> 20:00.730
So...say this partner thought tiffany
knew something about the semen-rustling

20:00.740 --> 20:03.730
and he ran her over to keep her quiet.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.730
So who's the partner?

20:05.740 --> 20:07.240
We've got cody's phone.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.310
Find out who he's been talking to.

20:11.740 --> 20:15.620
Johnson: Most of cody's calls were
to a number in durant,oklahoma.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.250
He lived on the family ranch.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.680
He was probably letting his folks
know how he was doing in the finals.

20:22.430 --> 20:26.220
All other calls were to
pbr staff and to tiffany.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.490
What about her records?

20:28.500 --> 20:30.400
Well,they're a little more interesting.

20:30.410 --> 20:33.380
Check out... last night.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.420
A dozen calls after
midnight from eric hong.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.140
Precious ricky.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.120
You know this guy?

20:47.550 --> 20:51.670
Yeah,he's a pimp,and he quit
calling her after 2:00 A.M.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.900
Like he knew she was already dead.

21:00.140 --> 21:03.330
all right,I don't want
nobody hitting me. All right?

21:03.860 --> 21:05.910
- Nobody's going to hit you,rick.
- Good.

21:07.070 --> 21:08.970
This is about tiffany rigdon.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.980
Beautiful girl,skin
like butterfly wings.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.090
Did you beat her up?

21:15.390 --> 21:17.880
I'm a lover,brother.

21:18.300 --> 21:19.260
Let me tell you something,man.

21:19.270 --> 21:22.460
You play around with me,I'm gonna
throw your ass in jail. You feel me?

21:22.470 --> 21:25.620
- Yeah,I feel you.
- Good.

21:26.390 --> 21:30.330
So she said she was leaving
you,going to get married,right?

21:30.690 --> 21:34.350
oh,come on,at least admit
I'm right about that.

21:35.510 --> 21:37.340
Yeah,okay,sure.

21:37.350 --> 21:40.070
Is that when you took her
boyfriend's truck and ran her over?

21:40.650 --> 21:42.460
- Wait.Wait.
- It's a good plan,

21:42.470 --> 21:45.340
You get the boyfriend and a little
revenge to boot. I mean,it'S...

21:45.350 --> 21:47.210
okay,I didn't like the
girl quitting on me,

21:47.220 --> 21:49.440
especially during one of my
busiest freaking weeks of the year,

21:49.450 --> 21:51.670
and I wanted to talk her out of it.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.930
Is that all you did: Talk?

21:52.940 --> 21:54.350
No,I couldn't even talk to her.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.180
She wouldn't take my
calls,so I quit trying.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.290
Where were you making all
these phone calls from?

21:59.300 --> 22:01.050
From a country-western bar.

22:01.060 --> 22:03.300
I hit them all when the
cowboys come to town.

22:03.310 --> 22:05.100
Mm-hmm,all right,all
right,I'll check it out.

22:05.110 --> 22:07.070
Yeah,you do that,please.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.150
I didn't take you for a
country music fan. Yee-ha.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.590
Shotgun.

23:56.350 --> 23:58.150
At rlose cange.

23:58.940 --> 24:02.830
Would have been pretty loud,but
everything is in a place like this.

24:02.840 --> 24:06.690
Cowboys,cattle rustling,and now
a shooting at the dance hall.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.700
Welcome to the wild west.

24:08.710 --> 24:13.130
So,coco,you didn't see anyone
threaten precious ricky?

24:13.140 --> 24:15.800
I was trying to put the nine
ball in the corner pocket.

24:15.810 --> 24:16.880
Yeah,right.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.090
You know this girl?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.260
That's tiffany.

24:19.270 --> 24:22.470
She got married last night. Lucky bitch.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.400
Do you know who the groom was?

24:24.810 --> 24:27.970
Troy? Troy something?

24:28.320 --> 24:29.850
Know anything about him?

24:29.860 --> 24:31.420
No. She just met him.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.040
Sweet kid.

24:33.300 --> 24:37.500
He,uh,took her side when that
cowgirl trash got all up in her face.

24:59.240 --> 25:00.600
hey,cowboy.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.350
Like that hat.

25:02.360 --> 25:03.540
Thank you.

25:04.810 --> 25:07.200
What's underneath don't
look too bad,either.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.590
I'm tiffany.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.880
I'm troy.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.600
We know what you are.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.090
Excuse me,miss,but we're having
a private conversation here.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.880
Why pay that cow when others
would give you the milk for free?

25:21.890 --> 25:23.870
I think you owe her an apology.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.940
We don't want your kind in here.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.100
Oh,yeah?

26:39.070 --> 26:42.340
She came back last night and said
that she was going to marry the guy.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.740
It's kind of impulsive,isn't it?

26:43.750 --> 26:47.630
Hey,cop,somebody says they want
to marry you,take care of you,

26:47.640 --> 26:53.310
pay all your bills,give you a nice
place to live,why would you even wait?

26:54.360 --> 26:57.830
It's always crazy busy with
the cowboys in this town.

26:57.840 --> 27:00.400
You know,I think it's being
around all these bucking bulls.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.160
Gets them all worked up.

27:02.170 --> 27:04.670
Brings out their
animal instinct to mate.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.440
according to the marriage bureau,

27:06.450 --> 27:10.470
troy birkhartand tiffany rigdon got
their license just before midnight.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.950
And then,what,troy came over to
your chapel to set up the service?

27:13.960 --> 27:16.980
Yeah. He said his girl
was changing at the hotel.

27:17.350 --> 27:19.000
It's the old story,you know.

27:19.010 --> 27:23.760
She gets cold feet,he can't face the
truth,keeps thinking she's running late.

27:57.610 --> 27:59.100
how long did he wait?

27:59.110 --> 28:00.410
Hours.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.330
He shows me the prize buckles
he's won for bull riding.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.070
Tells me he's going on
the pro tour next year.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.700
The little ranch they're
going to settle down on...

28:07.710 --> 28:10.580
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plains.

28:10.590 --> 28:12.180
And what time did he end up leaving?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.390
A little after 3:00 A.M.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.610
Frankly,if she's not going
to make a go of it,I say,

28:17.620 --> 28:22.750
better now than down the road before all the
lawyers and the property and all that mess.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.600
Wedding chapel's only a couple
blocks from the crime scene.

28:25.610 --> 28:28.110
Yeah,and she was killed at 2:30.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.440
Killed?

28:29.450 --> 28:32.500
Yeah,on the way to her own wedding.

28:32.510 --> 28:35.090
I'll get a bolo out on troy's vehicle.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.170
Attention,all officers:

28:58.180 --> 29:02.510
Attempt to locate yellow
ford ranger 2005 pickup,

29:02.520 --> 29:06.950

29:06.960 --> 29:11.420
Troy birkhart,white male adult,wanted
in connection with a 415a,

29:11.430 --> 29:14.030
eric hong homicide.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.640
Dispatch,this is c-21 brown.

29:16.650 --> 29:21.640
The pickup that you're looking
for is on level 3 of the pd garage.

29:21.650 --> 29:25.460
Suspect is in the
vehicle,armed and agitated.

29:25.470 --> 29:30.080
I repeat: Suspect is armed and agitated.

29:30.090 --> 29:33.040
Copy,c-21. Units responding.Code three

29:50.100 --> 29:51.370
hey,buddy.

29:51.930 --> 29:53.640
You must be troy,huh?

29:53.650 --> 29:57.380
just be cool,okay? All right?

30:00.000 --> 30:03.210
Hey,troy,listen to me.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.470
We don't want anyone getting hurt,okay?

30:07.480 --> 30:09.040
So put the gun down.

30:09.050 --> 30:11.620
Come out of the truck
with your hands up.

30:11.630 --> 30:15.170
Put the gun down,troy.
Just let it fall away.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.240
Now.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.010
He moves on that gun,don't wait.

30:21.020 --> 30:24.320
Hang on,jim. Let me...let
me talk to him real quick.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.600
- Okay,but we're not taking any chances.
- Yeah,yeah,okay.

30:30.280 --> 30:33.340
Hey,troy,when's the last
time you got down to big bend?

30:35.970 --> 30:38.360
You-you got the plate frame.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.800
Man,I used to go to
summer camp down there.

30:40.810 --> 30:42.280
Stay back!

30:42.600 --> 30:43.770
Hey,take it easy,troy.

30:43.780 --> 30:47.230
Look,I got no weapon on me.

30:48.070 --> 30:50.690
Okay,I just want to
talk to you for a second.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.570
I killed somebody!

30:54.580 --> 30:56.220
Yeah,I know.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.040
You came out to vegas,and
u yogot in over your head,

30:59.050 --> 31:01.480
but this is getting out of control.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.730
If you don't put that gun down,these
cops are going to start shooting,

31:03.740 --> 31:07.030
and that could turn out very bad
for both of us. You know what I mean?

31:08.410 --> 31:12.050
I'm just... I'm just
doing the right thing.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.000
Making sure you know it was me.

31:16.130 --> 31:18.570
And I'll pay for what I did.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.950
Eye for an eye,man.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.640
Stay back! I'll do it,I swear!

31:22.650 --> 31:23.640
- I'll do it,I swear!
- No,troy,just wait.

31:23.650 --> 31:26.150
Hang on now. Listen to me.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.150
I know about tiffany.

31:28.660 --> 31:31.920
I know why she stood you
up at the wedding chapel.

31:35.390 --> 31:37.020
That ricky.

31:40.570 --> 31:42.750
Thought he owned her.

31:46.930 --> 31:48.930
Hey,what you doing,man?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.860
he wouldn't let her come.

31:51.870 --> 31:55.310
Hey,man,look at me. Look at me.

31:59.570 --> 32:02.620
I know she wanted to be there for you.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.820
Come on out of there,man.
I'll tell you all about it.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.610
You don't want to do this.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.980
give me that.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.160
Come on,give me that
thing. Give it to me.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.770
it's going to be okay.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.290
Nice job

32:38.400 --> 32:40.350
you didn't go to summer camp.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.850
Missed you around here. Welcome back.

32:46.220 --> 32:47.560
Thanks.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.290
*********

32:55.300 --> 32:57.880
because he couldn't have opened
the bucking chute by himself.

32:57.890 --> 33:03.200
And we know that someone other than cody put the
electroejaculation equipment into the truck and drove away.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.730
Killing tiffany.

33:04.740 --> 33:09.750
Whoever that someone was knew how to get into
the arena,and also how to use the equipment.

33:11.810 --> 33:13.850
More cowbell!

33:17.570 --> 33:19.870
- I processed these for you.
- And?

33:19.880 --> 33:21.910
Well,as you can see,they're bull ropes.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.080
These are the kind that the
riders hold in their hands.

33:24.090 --> 33:27.070
Every rider has one,and
they're usually custom-made.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.760
I mean,look at that craftsmanship.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.090
Yeah,it's exquisite.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.620
Now,that's the rope that i
collected from cody's room?

33:33.630 --> 33:34.520
Yes,it is.

33:34.530 --> 33:36.900
Uh,you'll note that it is polynylon.

33:36.910 --> 33:39.530
Now the rope that was
collected from the crime scene,

33:39.540 --> 33:42.910
though,was long sisal,a type of hemp.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.380
Very old-school,and they
stopped making it years ago.

33:45.390 --> 33:49.980
That means the rope found with cody's body
belonged to someone who's been around for a while.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.510
How'd you like to go on a roundup?

33:58.760 --> 34:00.780
Hey,ms. Twicker,how's it going?

34:01.140 --> 34:04.410
It'd be going a lot better if my
bull wintwister was in there bucking.

34:05.150 --> 34:07.130
Is cash dooley here?

34:07.140 --> 34:08.639
Cash!

34:09.580 --> 34:11.659
Cops want to talk to you.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.290
Hey,mr.Dooley.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.650
So,where you staying
when you're here in vegas?

34:19.659 --> 34:20.590
Here.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.989
He's got the sleeper cab up front.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.190
Oh,right here.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.190
Is that where you keep your
clothes,the rest of your stuff?

34:27.199 --> 34:28.590
What's this about?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.159
I'd like to take a look in that cab.

34:30.170 --> 34:31.699
No. It's private.

34:31.710 --> 34:33.739
Nancy: Now hold on. I own this rig.

34:33.750 --> 34:37.260
If you guys want to search it,go ahead.

35:07.110 --> 35:11.240
Brass: Well,bull semen is property,and
that property isn't yours so it's theft.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.630
Now,here's what I think happened.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.580
You know cody. He's at
the end of his career.

35:15.590 --> 35:18.990
He's a little down on his
luck. Never put any money aside.

35:19.310 --> 35:23.500
Wintwister's output goes for 20
grand a pop on the open market.

35:23.770 --> 35:29.160
So you and cody,you get together,you
do the deed and,uh,sell it on the sly.

35:30.270 --> 35:34.360
If you knew cody,you'd know
he'd never do anything like that.

35:34.370 --> 35:37.480
And then when he told his
girlfriend,you took his truck.

35:37.490 --> 35:39.310
He always let me borrow his truck.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.060
Even when it was to hunt down his girl?

35:42.350 --> 35:43.410
Jim?

35:49.490 --> 35:51.930
We ran his ten-card against the prints
from the truck and the equipment.

35:51.940 --> 35:52.890
They don't match.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.480
So,there is a third guy?

35:54.490 --> 35:57.840
Right. So now,I'm convinced that cody
latshaw's death was not an accident.

36:06.370 --> 36:10.090
Okay,so who is working
with you on this,cash,huh?

36:10.460 --> 36:13.480
Who was at the wheel of cody's
truck when you ran down that girl?

36:13.490 --> 36:15.470
Was it someone in the arena?

36:19.030 --> 36:21.940
What's this,a cowboy code of silence?

36:21.950 --> 36:26.850
Look,you want to make me compel fingerprints
from everyone working in that arena,I can do that.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.300
we got a match!

36:40.310 --> 36:41.650
Dustin lightfoot.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.940
Dustin? He's a bullfighter.

36:48.310 --> 36:49.670
Right there

36:53.100 --> 36:57.230
I got a 440 exiting the east
end of the arena. Head him off.

37:04.910 --> 37:06.640
******

37:11.470 --> 37:13.490
Hold it. Freeze.Right there.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.920
Don't move.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.220
Hands behind your back.

37:19.610 --> 37:21.290
Well,howdy,partner.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.170
This is a new experience for me.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.640
First time I caught me a cattle rustler.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.250
Look,cash and me was just trying
to make a little extra money.

37:34.010 --> 37:37.470
Then cody latshaw came in
drunk and itching for a fight.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.500
- Quit that!
- Hey,cody.

37:45.510 --> 37:47.300
- You hear me?
- Cody,relax.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.550
Ain't nobody hurtin' anybody.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.550
That ain't your property.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.050
Cody,cody,just...

38:04.090 --> 38:05.790
He ain't breathin'.

38:06.770 --> 38:08.870
We wasn't tryin' to kill him.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.180
He had a cervical fracture
from his earlier ride.

38:11.190 --> 38:13.590
It didn't take much to snap his spine.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.190
Then you tried to make
it look like an accident.

38:32.930 --> 38:35.570
But you didn't have to
run over his girlfriend.

38:35.580 --> 38:38.530
That girl we hit-- that was...
that was cody's girlfriend?

38:38.540 --> 38:40.300
Yeah,you didn't know?

38:41.830 --> 38:44.620
We was racing to get
the product to our buyer.

38:44.940 --> 38:50.020
And we took cody's truck 'cause,well,mine
ain't air-conditioned and,

38:50.030 --> 38:52.460
and he wasn't gonna be usin' it.

39:07.930 --> 39:11.650
It's kind of a lonely life,these
cowboys,every weekend a different town.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.080
That's part of the tradition,you know.

39:13.090 --> 39:15.280
Solitary man out there
trying to find himself.

39:15.290 --> 39:18.510
Yeah,but no man is an island.

39:18.980 --> 39:22.350
I mean,obviously,he had feelings for nancy
or he wouldn't have written her that poem.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.370
Nancy? I don't know about that.

39:24.380 --> 39:25.510
Tiffany's the one that broke his heart.

39:25.520 --> 39:27.600
I don't think it's about either girl.

39:28.980 --> 39:33.160
"I can't help now but wonder what
your brown eyes were concealing."

39:33.940 --> 39:36.130
Did you read tiffany's autopsy report?

39:37.370 --> 39:38.930
Yeah,her eyes were blue.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.640
So were nancy'S.

39:40.650 --> 39:43.060
Then who did he write the poem for?

39:43.780 --> 39:45.740
Wintwister.

39:46.930 --> 39:47.880
The bull?

39:47.890 --> 39:50.950
I think that's why he went
back to the arena that night.

39:51.290 --> 39:55.860
Wordsworth once wrote,"through love
we feel we are greater than we know."

39:56.430 --> 40:01.350
My guess is,riding that
bull,cody felt like a greater man.

40:04.060 --> 40:08.590
"Our bodies close together,"like
my ride hand in my glove.

40:09.360 --> 40:13.610
"Hearts pounding with
excitement,and dare I say it,"love.

40:14.340 --> 40:17.910
"I know I'll never own you;
it's your nature to run free.

40:17.920 --> 40:22.350
"But I pray the lord above "that
one day you'll come back to me.

40:22.360 --> 40:26.480
"Then we'll ride off in
glory until our time is done.

40:27.660 --> 40:32.690
"And I will be your
hero,your cowboy in the sun."
