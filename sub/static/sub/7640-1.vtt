01:00.147 --> 01:03.696
The popcorn you're eating
has been pissed in.
Film at 11:00.

01:04.587 --> 01:08.341
At Argon, we know that a
country which depends on oil

01:08.467 --> 01:10.378
can't afford to run short.

01:10.507 --> 01:13.305
But conventional drilling
is not always possible.

01:13.427 --> 01:17.215
Now, new ways must be found
to produce crude oil.

01:17.747 --> 01:20.864
Here at our multi-million-dollar
refinery in Fairbanks.

01:20.987 --> 01:25.538
we're extracting 2,5 billions
of barrels of crude oil every day,

01:25.907 --> 01:27.818
from teenagers' faces.

01:27.947 --> 01:30.825
The crude oil can be shipped
via mammoth supertankers

01:30.947 --> 01:33.541
in order to better utilize
our country's vast supplies

01:33.667 --> 01:36.818
of yet untapped
natural resources.

01:37.187 --> 01:38.825
And here in Milan, Italy,

01:38.947 --> 01:43.338
an affiliate of Argon has
developed a way to reclaim oil

01:43.467 --> 01:46.857
from the discarded combs
of local residents. Enough to fill

01:46.987 --> 01:50.866
an 1,100 ft. tanker and save
60,000 gallons of valuable energy.

01:51.427 --> 01:52.826
Back in the United States,

01:52.947 --> 01:56.940
we've developed a way to filter
the oil from carry-out food.

01:57.067 --> 01:59.945
An amount sufficient to supply 
the entire city of Oakland

02:00.067 --> 02:02.865
in California.
And for the future, 

02:02.987 --> 02:07.822
the promise of capturing over forty
trillion cubic feet of natural gas

02:07.947 --> 02:12.225
has brought us to Beaumont, Texas,
and this unique recycling method.

02:12.547 --> 02:15.903
At Argon, we're working to
keep your money.

02:28.507 --> 02:31.579
Welcome to "A.M. Today."
I'm Barbara Duncan.

02:31.707 --> 02:32.901
I'm Frank Bowman.

02:33.027 --> 02:36.622
We'll  see why school children
are learning faster in Louisiana.

02:36.747 --> 02:38.897
Why trains are slower in Vermont.

02:39.027 --> 02:41.177
We'll meet an adorable, furry
Australian friend.

02:41.307 --> 02:44.140
And we'll take an up-close look
at the nation's newest safety craze:

02:44.267 --> 02:46.417
Smoke detector alarms.
But first,

02:46.547 --> 02:50.460
New York city teachers are voting
on whether to continue the strike.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.817
Ron Butler with local affiliate W.I.L.O.

02:52.947 --> 02:55.939
is at the convention center now
with a live report.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.697
Ron, what's the situation?

03:04.947 --> 03:06.938
Ron, are the teachers still voting?

03:09.467 --> 03:13.745
We are having trouble getting that report.
We'll try back later in the program.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.664
In the mean time, this is "A.M. Today."

03:15.787 --> 03:19.223
It's 18 minuters after the hour,
and time for our daily debate:

03:19.347 --> 03:23.704
Count Pointercount"
with J. Fitzsimmons and S. Hamilton.

03:24.747 --> 03:28.342
Sheila, I guess even you 
and your liberal cronies

03:28.507 --> 03:31.704
have found the light at the end
of love

03:31.827 --> 03:34.057
with our beloved president.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.982
The intellectuals have been
much agitated

03:37.107 --> 03:41.897
and now, having gotten the presidency
by exploiting the problems

03:42.027 --> 03:44.495
they themselves have manufactured,

03:44.627 --> 03:48.939
he has done his best to fuel their
anxieties about him.

03:49.067 --> 03:53.379
Sheila. Will you and your pack
of bleeding heart liberals

03:53.547 --> 03:56.505
never learn that
expanding welfare roles

03:56.627 --> 03:58.936
only accelerate inflation

03:59.067 --> 04:03.743
and inevitably hurt most
those they purport to help?

04:05.867 --> 04:08.700
Why John, you old stick in the mud.

04:09.787 --> 04:13.336
Ive been listening to that
horse shit of yours for months.

04:13.507 --> 04:17.101
And you can take that crap
and blow it out your ass.

04:17.226 --> 04:21.903
And for good measure,
sit on this, John.

04:23.667 --> 04:28.183
The teachers has completed their balloting
and the decision if forthcoming.

04:28.307 --> 04:31.697
Ron Butler, would you hazard a guess
as to the outcome for that vote?

04:37.067 --> 04:40.662
It's 19 min after the hour,
time for our daily feature:

04:40.787 --> 04:42.505
"The astrological report."

04:42.667 --> 04:46.945
These reports are not intended
to foster beliefs in astrology,

04:47.067 --> 04:51.618
but to support people who can not
take responsibility for their own lives.

04:52.067 --> 04:56.345
If you are a Libra and hesitate
to make this big purchase,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.583
hold on for a couple of days.

04:58.707 --> 05:01.665
Don't forget, your
Moon is in Sagittarius.

05:01.787 --> 05:04.176
Not the time for
reckless spending.

05:04.307 --> 05:07.424
You Virgos can expect
an untimely death

05:07.587 --> 05:12.024
or perhaps a tragic dismemberment
to someone close to you.

05:12.147 --> 05:15.662
Pisces: It's a good time to 
pull the plug on that machine

05:15.787 --> 05:19.063
that's been keeping your daughter
alive the past six months.

05:19.187 --> 05:21.747
If you are Taurus,
see your florist.

05:21.867 --> 05:26.383
And if you are Gemini like me,
you can expect the unexpected.

05:26.507 --> 05:29.226
I'm Joyce Wilson, your astro...

05:31.547 --> 05:32.821
Thank you, Joyce.

05:32.947 --> 05:36.735
With us, Judy Morton from the
San Diego Wild Animal Preserve.

05:36.867 --> 05:40.860
Judy's been a guest in the past,
it's always been a delightful segment.

05:40.987 --> 05:42.306
Welcome, Judy.

05:42.427 --> 05:43.382
What have you got
for us today?

05:43.507 --> 05:45.816
I brought an Australian gerbil,

05:45.947 --> 05:48.256
one of the few to have
been raised in captivity.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.105
He's tame, he won't bite?

05:50.227 --> 05:51.899
No, he's really friendly.

05:52.027 --> 05:54.382
They are very loveable.
His name is Oscar.

05:57.467 --> 05:59.059
I'd like to get one of those
for my kids.

05:59.187 --> 06:01.018
They would make great pets

06:01.187 --> 06:03.257
except that they really do need
a wild surrounding.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.946
Well... Oscar?

06:05.347 --> 06:07.417
- is absolutely irresistible.

06:07.547 --> 06:10.141
You have another surprise for us.

06:10.267 --> 06:11.586
That's right, Frank.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.626
The next fellow is not small,
but he certainly is cute.

06:15.787 --> 06:18.585
At least I think so.
I have to go get him.

06:18.747 --> 06:19.975
Go ahead.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.583
This is always one of my
favorite segments, because

06:23.747 --> 06:26.466
I never know quite what they
are going to bring out here.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.184
Look what they are bringin out here!

06:29.307 --> 06:31.059
This is Dino.

06:33.867 --> 06:35.095
He is huge!

06:35.227 --> 06:37.343
But don't let Dino's looks fool you,

06:37.467 --> 06:40.982
he's gentle as a lamb, as result
of being raised in captivity.

06:41.107 --> 06:42.859
That's why we're able
to bring him out here.

06:43.067 --> 06:44.420
Is this a rare animal?

06:44.547 --> 06:48.062
Yes, as a matter of fact
we're having trouble mating him.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.862
You're having trouble
finding a female for Dino?

06:51.307 --> 06:56.142
Not really, we have matched Dino
with several candidates,

06:56.307 --> 07:00.220
but all efforts of reproduction
have been unsuccessful.

07:00.347 --> 07:04.659
I can't believe it. Dino might
not be the most handsome,

07:04.827 --> 07:07.705
but certainly a big gorilla like this...

07:07.867 --> 07:10.904
We're not sure what
the trouble is with Dino.

07:11.027 --> 07:12.824
It could just be shyness,

07:12.987 --> 07:16.297
natural reluctance or
even impotence.

07:16.427 --> 07:17.337
Impotent?

07:27.867 --> 07:30.062
It is now 24 efter the hour,

07:30.187 --> 07:33.543
time for the top story
with Tom Leclair.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.495
Thank you, Barbara.

07:35.627 --> 07:39.779
It concerns the meeting
of OPEC ministers in Teheran.

07:39.987 --> 07:43.821
An anticipated 10% price hike
across the board...

07:47.507 --> 07:50.305
We've finally gotten through
to Ron Butler,

07:50.427 --> 07:54.215
And i'm told our audio is operating.
Go ahead, Ron.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.016
The balloting has lasted three hours.

07:57.147 --> 08:00.219
As soon as the absentees are
counted we should have the results.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.978
Is there any hint
about a possible outcome?

08:04.787 --> 08:07.460
I thought that the teachers
would like to return to work,

08:07.587 --> 08:11.375
but being a Gemini, 
I just never know what to expect.

09:01.027 --> 09:03.939
More offensive than "Mandingo"

09:04.947 --> 09:08.257
More shocking than
"Behind the Green Door"

09:08.827 --> 09:12.263
More erotic than
"Deep Throat"

09:12.707 --> 09:14.299
You will cream

09:14.467 --> 09:17.186
in your jeans when you see:

09:26.507 --> 09:28.896
recreating her classic roll.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.861
And introducing
Susan Joyce and Nancy Reems. 

09:32.987 --> 09:35.217
Susan, this is Nancy.

09:35.347 --> 09:37.702
Nancy, this is Susan.

09:38.827 --> 09:42.740
The screen has never dared
to be so explicit.

09:42.867 --> 09:44.698
Show me your nuts.

09:54.587 --> 09:57.579
Mrs. Burke! I thought you were Dale.

09:58.787 --> 10:02.860
People often mistake me for
my teenage daughter, Dale.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.739
Never before has the beauty of
the sexual act

10:12.867 --> 10:14.858
been so crassly exploited.

10:17.347 --> 10:21.135
The bizarre story of what happens
when high school girls

10:21.135 --> 10:24.000
are allowed to stay out after curfew.

10:25.227 --> 10:28.902
Finally an adult motion picture
has the courage to reveal

10:29.027 --> 10:31.222
tha truth about masturbation.

10:42.027 --> 10:43.779
You must see:

10:58.747 --> 10:59.975
How much is a ticket?

11:00.107 --> 11:01.540
Three dollars.

11:10.547 --> 11:11.741
Thank you.

11:20.427 --> 11:23.225
You are aware that this movie
is shown in "Feel-around"?

11:32.627 --> 11:33.855
Can I help you?

11:33.987 --> 11:36.217
Some popcorn, please.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.941
One dollar.

11:46.787 --> 11:47.822
Thank you.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.219
Come in. I am in the den.

12:36.347 --> 12:37.462
Guess who.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.379
Zsa Zsa Gabor. 

12:40.867 --> 12:43.939
Donald, you're always kidding.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.179
I see you've started smoking again. 

12:49.467 --> 12:51.344
I'm on another diet. 

12:54.467 --> 12:57.345
And you didn't even
notice my perfume. 

13:05.387 --> 13:06.866
May I mix you a drink?

13:07.267 --> 13:11.260
I propose a toast,
to you and me and the future.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.305
Darling, I'm so sorry. 

13:18.627 --> 13:21.016
Let me get you a towel
or something. 

13:26.507 --> 13:28.463
Carol, watch where you
swing that cigarette. 

13:33.307 --> 13:35.298
Let me put this bandage on. 

13:35.827 --> 13:37.783
My poor baby. 

13:39.587 --> 13:42.659
I love to run my hands
through your hair. 

13:45.427 --> 13:49.864
And those big strong
shoulders... 

13:51.467 --> 13:54.379
And that curly hair
on your chest... 

13:57.307 --> 13:59.218
You're the only one, Carol. 

14:11.747 --> 14:13.100
What's this?

14:13.507 --> 14:15.577
Lipstick on your collar?

14:15.747 --> 14:17.146
Let me see!

14:18.107 --> 14:20.302
It is lipstick on your collar!

14:20.627 --> 14:22.106
You cheat, you... 

14:23.707 --> 14:25.743
I could kill you!

14:27.227 --> 14:30.742
I could tear every hair of
your insensitive head. 

14:31.587 --> 14:33.782
Carol, put down that knife!

14:35.347 --> 14:37.019
All right, Donald. 

14:37.307 --> 14:40.344
Tell me you love me
or I'll slit your throat. 

14:40.467 --> 14:44.176
I wouldn't tell you that
in a million years. 

14:46.547 --> 14:49.584
So you want to see
your own blood, Donald?

14:49.747 --> 14:54.537
You can't scare me. I'm not afraid
of spilling my own blood. 

14:57.387 --> 14:59.298
I can't do it. 

15:07.987 --> 15:10.342
I know you wouldn't do it.

15:10.787 --> 15:14.177
That's why I want you to marry me.

15:25.267 --> 15:28.976
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Rialto "Feel-o-rama" invites you 

15:29.107 --> 15:33.339
to stay for our next picture
"Deep Throat", 

15:33.467 --> 15:35.458
which will begin shortly.

15:43.387 --> 15:46.379
It's hard to believe
you went to bed with a headache,

15:46.547 --> 15:49.778
when you wake up feeling
so wonderful. 

15:49.907 --> 15:52.262
Thanks to Nytex P.M.

15:52.387 --> 15:55.265
The pain reliever that works
while you sleep.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.184
Nytex relaxes you. 

15:57.307 --> 16:00.583
Relieves pains from
tensions and minor discomforts.

16:00.707 --> 16:03.619
You wake up feeling so wonderful, 

16:03.787 --> 16:06.665
refreshed and ready
to begin a new day.

16:07.147 --> 16:09.536
It's hard to believe
you went to bed with a headache

16:09.667 --> 16:12.943
when you wake up
feeling so wonderful.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.817
Nytex P.M., it is hard to believe. 

16:24.467 --> 16:28.301
Hello and welcome to
"High Adventure."

16:28.427 --> 16:30.258
I am Paul Burmaster.

16:30.387 --> 16:33.538
With us today, the famed
adventurer and explorer,

16:33.707 --> 16:34.935
Claude Lamont.

16:35.147 --> 16:37.707
Claude, it's a pleasure
to have you with us.

16:37.827 --> 16:39.738
It's a great pleasure to be here.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.097
It's a thrill to
have someone with us

16:42.267 --> 16:44.223
who lives such great adventures.

16:44.387 --> 16:46.696
I live the unknown,

16:46.827 --> 16:49.739
I love the unknown,
I am the unknown.

16:49.867 --> 16:52.540
Claude...
Where are you living, now?

16:52.667 --> 16:54.862
That is unknown.
I don't know.

16:55.227 --> 16:59.505
Let me ask you about
the film we're going to see.

16:59.667 --> 17:03.137
I understand there were
great dangers involved.

17:03.827 --> 17:07.023
Yes, there were
great many dangers involved.

17:07.186 --> 17:11.260
The most dangerous,
was the poisonous fish.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.135
Poisonous fish?

17:14.827 --> 17:16.180
Continue, it is your show.

17:16.307 --> 17:17.626
No, you are my guest.

17:20.186 --> 17:23.781
The poisonous fish will kill
more faster than a bullet.

17:23.906 --> 17:26.740
In what ocean do we
find these fish?

17:26.867 --> 17:28.903
The Atlantic and the Pacific.

17:29.027 --> 17:31.905
What sizes are they?

17:32.067 --> 17:34.456
Some are very large,
others very small.

17:36.107 --> 17:37.426
That's very interesting.

17:38.427 --> 17:39.860
Tell us, Claude,

17:41.947 --> 17:44.859
how many men do you take 
with you on these voyages?

17:45.027 --> 17:48.906
Sometimes, we take 45 or 50 men

17:49.027 --> 17:50.506
on a single voyage.

17:51.027 --> 17:52.938
- That many?
- Yes.

17:53.067 --> 17:56.742
You can just imagine
the food problems we have.

17:57.267 --> 18:00.145
Often, we must take
enough food for three,

18:00.307 --> 18:02.104
maybe four months at a time.

18:02.507 --> 18:04.862
The important thing,
is to eat well

18:04.987 --> 18:07.262
on a regular basis.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.460
If you don't eat
well balanced meals at sea,

18:11.827 --> 18:13.943
several things can happen.

18:25.627 --> 18:28.539
By the way, many of you
may not know this,

18:28.667 --> 18:32.626
but Claude Lamont has made
many humanitarian deeds.

18:32.747 --> 18:37.502
He is a teacher of diving and
involved with several charities.

18:38.267 --> 18:42.306
You've done work with
the great white shark.

18:42.427 --> 18:46.420
Have you verified this idea
of distinct territories?

18:46.547 --> 18:51.302
Not only has this idea
been substantiated,

18:51.427 --> 18:55.625
we also can show
that few or no shark

18:55.747 --> 18:58.580
change territories.

18:59.267 --> 19:03.704
My guest tonight has been 
famed explorer Claude Lamont.

19:03.987 --> 19:06.979
This is Paul Burmaster, 
thanking you for joining us on:

19:07.107 --> 19:09.701
"High Adventure."

19:18.747 --> 19:21.545
Moscow in flames. 
Missiles headed toward New York.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.100
Film at 11:00.

19:24.547 --> 19:27.425
Actor/director,
Bill Bixby.

19:28.147 --> 19:32.618
People must feel their best
to do their best.

19:32.747 --> 19:37.343
So when I'm on the set
and have headache pain,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.139
I take Sanhedrin.

19:39.307 --> 19:43.903
Here, at the world's leading
headache clinic.

19:44.027 --> 19:46.700
tests have proven 
Sanhedrin's modern formula

19:46.827 --> 19:49.500
provides fast, effective
relief from pain of:

19:49.627 --> 19:53.939
headache, cold
or minor arthritic discomfort

19:54.067 --> 19:55.341
It's safe

19:55.467 --> 19:57.935
and effective. So the next time
you have a cold,

19:58.627 --> 19:59.901
do what Bill Bixby does,

20:00.347 --> 20:04.226
take Sanhedrin. 
The extra strength pain reliever.

20:10.987 --> 20:14.377
I remember the day
the girls came over for bridge club.

20:14.507 --> 20:17.817
I was so embarrassed
because of lingering odors.

20:26.067 --> 20:28.183
Fish for dinner last night?

20:32.947 --> 20:35.825
Harvey's still smoking those cigars?

20:39.387 --> 20:42.743
Christ! Did a cow shit in here?

20:54.067 --> 20:55.659
That was a delicious dinner.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.937
I do my best.

21:36.587 --> 21:40.023
Welcome to
"The Wonderful World of Sex",

21:40.347 --> 21:42.338
where together we will achieve

21:42.507 --> 21:45.783
a new level of sexual fulfillment.

21:46.027 --> 21:50.782
After dimming the lights, give
your partner a reassuring smile, 

21:50.907 --> 21:52.818
and a gentle kiss. 

21:56.627 --> 22:01.337
Then, move to opposite areas
of the bedroom to disrobe.

22:06.707 --> 22:08.698
The revelation of
erogenous zones

22:08.827 --> 22:12.376
is an enticing prelude
to sexual foreplay

22:13.107 --> 22:15.223
Become aware of your own body

22:15.347 --> 22:18.259
as it readies itself
for the ultimate

22:18.387 --> 22:20.139
sensual awareness. 

22:22.507 --> 22:25.977
It is now time to approach
your love partner

22:26.467 --> 22:28.776
placing both hands
round her waist.

22:29.267 --> 22:30.143
Tenderly...

22:32.307 --> 22:35.902
Moving smoothly up the torso,

22:36.107 --> 22:39.497
slowly massaging
the erotic areas,

22:39.627 --> 22:41.822
and gently exploring the curves

22:41.947 --> 22:43.619
of the upper body. 

22:44.587 --> 22:47.499
Wasn't that nice?

22:47.867 --> 22:51.177
Now you are ready to approach
the conjugal bed, 

22:51.347 --> 22:54.703
relaxing as you fill your senses,

22:54.827 --> 22:57.660
in your world of awareness.

22:57.947 --> 23:01.337
A this instant, the male 
may whisper to the female:

23:01.507 --> 23:03.941
A: "I love you."

23:04.507 --> 23:07.101
B: "I need you". 

23:07.387 --> 23:10.345
or C: "I want you."

23:10.947 --> 23:11.857
"B"

23:11.987 --> 23:15.821
The female may respond:
"I want you now." 

23:15.947 --> 23:17.380
"I want you now." 

23:20.387 --> 23:22.457
"Recuerdos a todos." 

23:29.747 --> 23:33.660
It is now time to insert
the birth control device. 

24:24.747 --> 24:26.544
And we're back. 

24:30.067 --> 24:33.980
We are now ready to heighten
our foreplay to petting.

24:34.427 --> 24:37.624
The male may fondle
her back and arms.

24:38.107 --> 24:41.019
The female, if she is so inclined,

24:41.147 --> 24:43.615
may latch on to his honker.

24:44.347 --> 24:47.578
Now he may kiss her gently
on the face and neck, 

24:47.707 --> 24:50.460
seeking out the erogenous zones. 

24:54.867 --> 24:57.700
The kissing should be
increasingly passionate, 

24:57.827 --> 25:01.820
with both partners working into
a sexual frenzy.

25:05.427 --> 25:09.306
One of the most frequent problems
encountered during the sexual act 

25:09.427 --> 25:12.544
is that of
premature ejaculation. 

25:14.787 --> 25:17.585
Should premature ejaculation occur, 

25:17.707 --> 25:20.175
"The Joy of Sex" album
comes equipped with

25:20.707 --> 25:22.823
"BIG JIM SLADE". 

25:26.787 --> 25:30.826
Big Jim, tight end for Kansas City Chiefs
is outfitted with whips, chains

25:30.947 --> 25:33.381
and a sexual appetite
that will knock your socks off.

25:33.507 --> 25:35.577
Big Jim has satisfied women
throughout the world, 

25:35.747 --> 25:38.466
and the capital of Nebraska
is Lincoln!

26:03.947 --> 26:05.221
Three days ago, 

26:05.947 --> 26:08.302
Russian intelligence
sent up this photograph,

26:08.427 --> 26:12.056
clearly at least a thirty
megaton nuclear blast.

26:13.147 --> 26:17.220
First reports from CIA
linked it with the red Chinese.

26:18.107 --> 26:22.225
however, Radio Peking
denied the allegation.

26:23.347 --> 26:25.781
These are the Hartz mountains of Asia.

26:25.947 --> 26:30.065
A terrain so rugged, so traitorous,
no country will claim it.

26:30.587 --> 26:31.781
Worse than Detroit?

26:31.947 --> 26:33.585
I am afraid so.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.987
Here, doctor Klahn has built
his fortress.

26:38.467 --> 26:39.377
Klahn?

26:39.547 --> 26:41.583
Yes. Klahn has been connected

26:41.707 --> 26:45.416
with every sort of
nefarious activity:

26:45.787 --> 26:48.347
Opium, weapons traffick, assassination,

26:48.467 --> 26:50.219
motion picture distribution...

26:50.667 --> 26:52.305
And global extortion.

26:52.427 --> 26:54.861
Precisely. Klahn has kidnapped

26:55.587 --> 27:00.217
the famous Chinese
nuclear physicist Ada Gronik.

27:00.387 --> 27:04.296
And attends to use
her knowledge of atomic devices

27:04.427 --> 27:07.499
to create a practical detonator,

27:07.627 --> 27:10.585
with which he will then
threaten the world.

27:11.827 --> 27:15.661
This is Butkus. Klahn's bodyguard.

27:15.947 --> 27:18.063
He is tough and ruthless.

27:19.427 --> 27:22.419
Here is Kwong, Klahn's chauffeur.

27:22.547 --> 27:24.822
He is rough and toothless.

27:25.307 --> 27:28.185
We need someone to find
an uncharted mountain,

27:28.307 --> 27:30.218
defeat an army of killers

27:30.507 --> 27:33.067
and come back with Ada Gronik.

27:33.267 --> 27:34.985
I know just the man.

28:46.547 --> 28:49.345
I hope you were paying attention.

28:56.107 --> 28:57.381
Kick me.

29:06.427 --> 29:07.826
What was that?

29:08.627 --> 29:10.982
This is not a charade.

29:11.427 --> 29:14.783
We need total concentration.

29:16.067 --> 29:18.103
Now, once again.

29:18.227 --> 29:22.186
This time, with feeling.

29:28.387 --> 29:29.502
Better.

29:39.267 --> 29:42.703
My government is prepared
to offer you 50,000 pounds,

29:42.827 --> 29:45.136
to join Klahn's army
as our agent.

29:48.147 --> 29:51.378
I'm afraid you underestimated me,
Mr. Pennington.

29:51.947 --> 29:54.666
Your people and mine,
have different values.

29:55.587 --> 29:56.702
Mr. Loo,

29:56.907 --> 30:00.695
you must understand that the survival
of the free world is at stake.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.977
You must understand,
Mr. Pennington,

30:03.427 --> 30:07.340
geographical boundaries
are of no significance to me.

30:07.707 --> 30:11.017
I owe my allegiance
to a higher source.

30:12.467 --> 30:15.698
But you'll have the chance
to kill fifty or sixty people.

30:38.707 --> 30:42.017
Hello. My name is Ming Chow.

30:42.667 --> 30:45.306
You are joining a noble leader.

32:34.187 --> 32:36.747
Gentlemen, welcome.

32:37.147 --> 32:39.707
We are honored
to have you among us.

32:40.507 --> 32:42.304
We are building a fighting force

32:42.427 --> 32:45.703
of an extraordinary magnitude.

32:46.307 --> 32:48.059
We forge our spirits

32:48.187 --> 32:51.497
in the tradition of our ancestors.

32:51.827 --> 32:54.705
You have our gratitude.

33:18.627 --> 33:20.697
ADA, I HAVE COME TO RESCUE YOU

33:28.987 --> 33:31.581
Now, bring me the prisoners!

33:49.107 --> 33:51.826
Now, take him to be tortured.

33:58.147 --> 34:00.377
As for my American friend,

34:00.787 --> 34:03.620
the CIA thinks he can infiltrate

34:03.747 --> 34:05.783
the mountain of doctor Klahn?

34:06.107 --> 34:09.018
You can't scare me,
you slant-eyed yellow bastard!

34:11.266 --> 34:13.178
Take him to Detroit.

34:14.706 --> 34:16.777
No! Not Detroit!

34:16.907 --> 34:20.058
Please! Anything but that.

34:21.266 --> 34:25.146
This way, gentlemen. I'll
show you to your rooms.

34:32.867 --> 34:37.577
Hello, this is doctor Klahn. 
I'm not home right now.

34:37.987 --> 34:40.784
Leave me a message
when you hear the beep.

34:40.907 --> 34:43.101
You have our gratitude. 

35:03.147 --> 35:04.102
Come in.

35:09.787 --> 35:12.017
I have come to rescue you.

35:12.227 --> 35:13.626
Where do you come from?

35:14.147 --> 35:15.375
Pennington...

35:17.707 --> 35:20.699
How was your trip
to the mountains, Mr. Loo?

35:21.747 --> 35:25.262
It was a very pleasant journey.

35:25.387 --> 35:29.380
You are fortunated. The seas can
be very stormy this time of year.

35:29.507 --> 35:33.458
I hope your accomodations are
to your liking.

35:35.267 --> 35:38.816
Doctor Klahn has a great
sense of hospitality.

35:39.907 --> 35:43.297
Have you ever been in
a martial arts army like this?

35:44.307 --> 35:46.741
Not for quite some time.

35:47.027 --> 35:51.339
I am sure you'll find
the caliber of men here

35:51.467 --> 35:52.900
among the finest in the world.

35:53.907 --> 35:57.263
We're building a fighting force
of extraordinary magnitude.

35:57.387 --> 35:59.343
You honor our mountains.

35:59.467 --> 36:03.346
We forge our spirits in the
tradition of our ancestors.

36:05.587 --> 36:08.499
The guards will have to be bribed.
We need money.

36:08.627 --> 36:11.141
We can waste some money,
thats no problem.

36:15.387 --> 36:18.299
But it would be wrong!

37:05.947 --> 37:07.221
What was that?

37:08.067 --> 37:11.742
This is not a charade.

37:12.187 --> 37:14.781
We need total concentration.

37:16.587 --> 37:17.815
Try again.

38:17.387 --> 38:20.220
I brought you a present.
Take your pick.

38:27.547 --> 38:29.538
If you don't see anything you like...

39:22.747 --> 39:27.298
And if you follow me,
we are now entering the Haybrick wing,

39:27.427 --> 39:29.577
where the opium goes through
it's final processing

39:29.707 --> 39:32.904
prior to packaging 
and world wide distribution.

39:33.027 --> 39:35.143
We manufacture enough heroine

39:35.267 --> 39:38.737
to supply one fourth
of the world's addicts.

39:38.947 --> 39:43.384
The tanks to your left, stores our
biological chemicals for germ warfare.

39:43.507 --> 39:46.499
Their capacity is of 4,000 cubic liters.

39:47.187 --> 39:49.257
To my right, is the atomic detonator,

39:49.387 --> 39:53.266
with which the Dr Kahn intends
to threaten the entire world.

39:54.027 --> 39:55.540
Are there any questions?

39:56.347 --> 39:59.544
No? Good. Follow me.

39:59.667 --> 40:03.546
We remind you to stay near the 
white line, and not using flash bulbs.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.425
A toy robot!

41:02.707 --> 41:03.981
A toy robot?

41:04.507 --> 41:06.145
Eat lead, sucker!

42:43.627 --> 42:45.697
You have my gratitude.

42:45.827 --> 42:49.615
You are a man of an
extraordinary magnitude.

43:17.787 --> 43:18.822
Come in.

44:39.827 --> 44:44.457
Your technique is only surpassed
by your courage, Mr. Loo.

44:45.427 --> 44:48.305
A magnificent display of skill.

44:48.947 --> 44:51.222
I am flattered by your curiosity.

44:51.347 --> 44:56.102
Evidently, you are anxious
to see my operation.

45:06.587 --> 45:08.020
Who are they?

45:08.147 --> 45:11.617
Refuse, found in waterfront bars.

45:13.867 --> 45:15.016
Shanghaied? 

45:15.147 --> 45:19.425
Just lost drunken men who don't know
where they are, and no longer care.

45:21.347 --> 45:22.860
Where are we?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.343
I don't care.

45:27.747 --> 45:29.021
And these?

45:29.147 --> 45:33.698
These are lost drunken men who don't
know where they are, but do care.

45:34.187 --> 45:38.703
And these are men who know where
they are and care, but don't drink.

45:38.867 --> 45:41.461
Where am I?
I don't know who I am!

45:41.587 --> 45:42.861
Yeah. and I don't drink. 

45:43.427 --> 45:44.143
Guards!

45:51.107 --> 45:53.063
- Do you care?
- No.

45:53.187 --> 45:56.065
Put this man in cell number one,
and give him a drink.

45:57.147 --> 45:59.741
- What do you drink?
- I don't care.

46:06.787 --> 46:07.697
Gentlemen.

46:08.707 --> 46:11.665
Regrettably, we have
discovered among us

46:11.787 --> 46:13.857
am unfriendly visitor.

46:14.667 --> 46:18.216
Mr. Loo will be punished
for his treason.

46:18.427 --> 46:21.305
But that is not important right now.

46:21.787 --> 46:25.666
What is important, is that my
guards have accepted bribes

46:25.787 --> 46:28.255
and failing their duties.

46:29.187 --> 46:32.497
Now, they must prove
themselves worthy

46:32.627 --> 46:34.504
to remain among us.

46:35.587 --> 46:37.976
Let us meet our guards.

46:42.107 --> 46:46.225
Number one is a senior on Klahn's
mountain and aspires to be a chemist.

46:46.347 --> 46:49.066
Welcome, please, Hung Well!

46:52.867 --> 46:58.546
Number two is a real skating buff.
A warm welcome for Long Wang!

47:02.827 --> 47:06.342
Traveling comes naturally to number three,
as he's a licensed airplane pilot. 

47:07.467 --> 47:09.698
Welcome, please, Enormous Genitals!

47:15.507 --> 47:18.340
Guard number one,
you're out on your first date,

47:18.467 --> 47:21.618
it is too late to see a movie.
What do you propose to do?

47:22.307 --> 47:23.535
Well...

47:23.667 --> 47:27.296
First, we walk on the beach
to the moonlight.

47:27.627 --> 47:30.664
Then I play love songs
on my guitar.

47:31.227 --> 47:32.262
And the next morning...

47:32.427 --> 47:33.223
Butkus!

47:37.547 --> 47:38.536
Guard number two,

47:39.627 --> 47:43.825
if I were asleep,
and you were my alarm clock,

47:44.387 --> 47:46.378
how would you wake me up
in the morning?

47:46.507 --> 47:49.101
I wouldn't. I'm no ding-a-ling.

47:54.787 --> 47:55.902
How about you, number three?

47:56.547 --> 47:57.866
The same question?

47:58.387 --> 48:02.096
We're building a fighting force
of extraordinary magnitude.

48:03.107 --> 48:06.304
We forge our spirits in the same
tradition as our ancestors.

48:06.987 --> 48:11.299
Dr. Klahn is magnificent leader.
He has our gratitude.

48:11.467 --> 48:13.423
Let's give Dr. Klahn
a great big hand!

48:31.667 --> 48:34.579
Are you ready for this mornings
exercise, Mr. Loo?

54:19.147 --> 54:20.500
Not water!

54:28.627 --> 54:30.902
I'm melting!

54:31.907 --> 54:32.942
What a world!

54:34.947 --> 54:38.383
It was a fighting force
of extraordinary magnitude!

54:42.427 --> 54:44.145
Congratulations, Mr. Loo.

54:44.667 --> 54:46.976
Your mission is a complete success.

54:47.387 --> 54:50.379
Since you are responsible for
the death of Dr. Klahn,

54:50.507 --> 54:55.183
you may assume the rights to the
fortress and all it's riches.

54:56.627 --> 54:58.538
Thank you, Mr. Pennington.

54:59.067 --> 55:02.377
But all I wanna do right now,
is to go back home.

55:03.547 --> 55:05.185
Back to Kansas.

55:05.307 --> 55:10.176
But my dear fellow, you had the
power to go back home all along.

55:10.307 --> 55:11.422
I had?

55:11.707 --> 55:15.700
All you have to do is
click your heels three times,

55:15.867 --> 55:19.655
and say: "There's no place
like home."

55:26.587 --> 55:29.260
There's no place like home.

55:47.187 --> 55:48.381
Loo...

55:48.507 --> 55:51.180
Wake up!

55:54.267 --> 55:55.666
Auntie Em!

55:57.547 --> 55:58.741
Toto!

56:00.787 --> 56:01.902
I'm home at last.

56:02.027 --> 56:04.461
You must have had a bad dream.

56:06.707 --> 56:07.981
No, I was there.

56:08.147 --> 56:09.580
Where were you?

56:10.267 --> 56:11.461
On this terrible mountain

56:11.627 --> 56:13.345
ruled by the evil Dr. Klahn.

56:13.507 --> 56:15.145
And there were prisoners, and...

56:15.627 --> 56:16.776
Jake was there and...

56:18.787 --> 56:20.584
Slim, and Ben.

56:24.307 --> 56:26.025
Maybe it was just a dream.

56:26.187 --> 56:28.303
And quite a nasty one, young feller!

56:28.427 --> 56:31.624
A dream of extraordinary magnitude.

56:33.627 --> 56:36.095
- It sure was real.
- I know, dear.

56:36.587 --> 56:38.942
But what have you learned
from all of this?

56:39.427 --> 56:40.462
Well,

56:41.347 --> 56:44.180
you can search all over for happiness,

56:45.267 --> 56:48.816
but there's no need to look
any further than your own front door.

56:49.307 --> 56:52.458
There are plenty of things you can do
in your own community.

56:54.547 --> 56:56.219
To visit a dairy

56:56.587 --> 56:59.818
and find out how milk is handled and
prepared for delivery.

57:00.787 --> 57:03.745
Or plant a series of window displays
on home safety.

57:04.307 --> 57:06.218
Or help start a library.

57:06.667 --> 57:10.296
To discuss with your dentist how
to make your teeth more attractive.

57:29.747 --> 57:33.820
You've just sold your last case of incense

57:33.947 --> 57:35.699
and pestered over sixty pedestrians. 

57:35.947 --> 57:39.257
After a gruelling day,
you finally run out of leaflets.

57:39.867 --> 57:42.506
Now it's Willer time.

57:42.627 --> 57:44.504
Time to kick off your sandals,

57:44.627 --> 57:47.699
and pop open a Willer. 

57:47.827 --> 57:51.376
The best taste in beer since 1892.

57:52.027 --> 57:54.780
It's time to relax
after a tough day. 

57:54.907 --> 57:59.298
You owe yourself
the best tasting beer you can buy. 

57:59.547 --> 58:01.219
It goes down easily. 

58:01.627 --> 58:04.380
It's cool, refreshing
and far less filling. 

58:07.467 --> 58:10.982
You're only reincarnated
six or seven times in life,

58:11.107 --> 58:14.656
so you got to reach
for all the guster you can.

58:18.507 --> 58:21.499
"Rams" plagued by fumbles
as earthquake shatters Los Angeles.

58:21.627 --> 58:22.742
Film at 11:00.

58:24.907 --> 58:28.104
New from Barker Brothers,
a game for the entire family. 

58:28.267 --> 58:31.498
"Scot Free." Your team has just
assassinated the president.

58:32.027 --> 58:34.416
Can you get away "Scot Free"? 

58:34.547 --> 58:36.060
Shake the dice and see. 

58:36.587 --> 58:38.942
Great! You found a patsy. Go again. 

58:43.107 --> 58:44.699
Bonus card.

58:45.107 --> 58:47.416
You get Jack Ruby to kill your patsy. 

58:47.787 --> 58:49.937
That's good because
dead men don't talk.

58:51.347 --> 58:52.780
Oh no! Abraham Sabruter
films the assassination.

58:53.427 --> 58:55.736
Tough break. But now you go again.

58:56.027 --> 58:56.982
And a stroke of luck, 

58:57.107 --> 58:58.699
Twenty-two witnesses 

58:58.827 --> 59:01.660
die of unnatural causes.
Now your opponent shakes again. 

59:03.667 --> 59:06.545
"Life Magazine"
buys the Sabruter film.

59:06.667 --> 59:07.986
But, you buy "Life Magazine"

59:08.107 --> 59:10.496
and show the frames out of sequence.

59:10.627 --> 59:14.345
You're almost home. Now you must spin 
the "Public Opinion Board."

59:15.307 --> 59:17.263
You've got it! The public believes it. 

59:17.387 --> 59:20.663
You're "Scot Free"!
Available from Barker Brothers. 

59:22.227 --> 59:26.186
If you were thrilled by
"The Towering Inferno", 

59:26.987 --> 59:30.138
if you were terrified by
"Earthquake", 

59:32.027 --> 59:35.617
then you will be
scared shitless

59:35.747 --> 59:39.342
by the Samuel L. Bronkowitz
production of

59:43.107 --> 59:46.986
The most realistic depiction
of death, doom and destruction

59:47.107 --> 59:51.305
in motion picture history.
See George Lazenby 

59:51.427 --> 59:52.496
as the architect. 

59:52.627 --> 59:55.425
This building is unsafe.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.339
Barbara Radnitz as the nurse.

01:00:04.547 --> 01:00:07.141
Jack Roberts as the governor. 

01:00:07.307 --> 01:00:08.865
Governor, the city is in flames,

01:00:08.987 --> 01:00:11.785
the national guards powerless
to deal with the situation,

01:00:11.907 --> 01:00:13.420
the dam is threatening to burst,

01:00:13.587 --> 01:00:15.817
the airport has been
seized by terrorists,

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:18.547
and the nuclear plant
is about to blow any second!

01:00:18.947 --> 01:00:21.825
Governor, what are we going to do?

01:00:25.547 --> 01:00:29.506
Donald Sutherland as the clumsy waiter. 

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.737
Larry, you can't go in there!
It's certain death!

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.823
But I've got to. For Helen's sake!

01:00:44.427 --> 01:00:45.496
Leave her.

01:00:45.627 --> 01:00:47.458
Come back to Montana with me.

01:00:47.587 --> 01:00:49.817
I could no sooner
run away from her than myself.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:53.219
I'm not asking you to run,
I'm asking you to face reality!

01:00:53.387 --> 01:00:55.298
Whose reality, yours or mine?

01:00:55.467 --> 01:00:57.742
My reality AND yours, that's whose!

01:00:57.867 --> 01:00:58.982
What are you saying?

01:00:59.267 --> 01:01:01.576
Leave her! Come back to Montana with me!

01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:03.937
I could no more
run away from her than myself!

01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:07.139
I'm not asking you to run,
I'm asking you to face reality!

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:08.700
Whose reality, yours or mine?

01:01:08.827 --> 01:01:11.387
My reality AND yours, that's whose!

01:01:11.507 --> 01:01:12.826
What are you saying?

01:01:16.267 --> 01:01:19.020
Larry, we're going now!

01:01:19.587 --> 01:01:20.542
Whose game?

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:22.658
You know damn well whose game.

01:01:25.707 --> 01:01:28.141
Larry, we're starting the engines.

01:01:29.027 --> 01:01:31.746
You will never forget 

01:01:35.427 --> 01:01:37.895
You know damn well what I'm saying!

01:01:39.747 --> 01:01:43.740
In the past year,
over 800,000 Americans have died.

01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:46.182
Despite millions of dollars in research,

01:01:46.307 --> 01:01:49.504
death continues to be
our nation's number one killer.

01:01:49.627 --> 01:01:51.743
Hello, I'm Henry Gibson,

01:01:51.867 --> 01:01:55.177
speaking to you on behalf of 
the United Appeal for the Dead.

01:01:55.707 --> 01:01:59.583
So far, there is no treatment
for death's crippling effects,

01:01:59.747 --> 01:02:04.537
still everyone can acquaint himself
with the warning signs of death:

01:02:11.987 --> 01:02:14.979
It is also important to know
what to do when you die.

01:02:23.347 --> 01:02:27.659
Your past contributions to this cause
has already worked wonders.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:30.182
Many deserving families
have been helped.

01:02:30.307 --> 01:02:33.299
Right now, I'd like you to
meet the Hefsteders.

01:02:34.107 --> 01:02:36.541
Three years ago, our Johnny died.

01:02:36.747 --> 01:02:39.215
We thought that there was no hope,
but then we discovered

01:02:39.387 --> 01:02:41.264
the United Appeal for the Dead.

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:43.981
They showed us that despite
Johnny's handicap,

01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:47.304
he could still be a useful member of
our family and the community.

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:50.466
Our "United Appeal for the Dead"
caseworker,

01:02:50.587 --> 01:02:53.818
showed us that the absence
of life from Johnny's body

01:02:53.947 --> 01:02:57.144
didn't have to mean his absence
from our daily life. 

01:02:59.107 --> 01:03:02.338
We realized the constant joy
that could be ours,

01:03:02.507 --> 01:03:05.943
as we were able to include him
in our family activities.

01:03:07.507 --> 01:03:10.943
The United Appeal for the Dead
turn misery into happiness. 

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:15.185
We have them to thank for our family's
newfound togetherness. 

01:03:16.107 --> 01:03:17.859
This is Henry Gibson saying:

01:03:17.987 --> 01:03:21.536
please, give generously
when death knocks at your door.

01:03:23.947 --> 01:03:26.700
No pictures, please.

01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:29.697
I said no pictures, no comments.

01:03:31.827 --> 01:03:32.942
No pictures.

01:03:46.587 --> 01:03:49.260
On September 22, 1957,

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:51.662
there occured a multi-car collision

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:55.336
resulting in over
55,000 dollars in damages.

01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:59.302
Today we bring you the trial
resulting from that incident.

01:03:59.907 --> 01:04:03.820
The litigants you will see are the
actual people involved in the accident.

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:07.782
As we join the preceding,
judge Coarse DeSmizer,

01:04:07.907 --> 01:04:11.536
is about to ask Mr. Hornung to make
his opening remarks.

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:15.183
Mr. Hornung, you may make your
opening remarks.

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:20.377
If it pleases the court,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:04:20.507 --> 01:04:22.498
it is my intention to prove here today,

01:04:22.627 --> 01:04:26.336
that on the evening
of February 22, 1957,

01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:28.776
Sheldon Grunwald
was driving his vehicle

01:04:28.947 --> 01:04:31.859
on the northbound lane 
of U.S. highway 30,

01:04:32.027 --> 01:04:34.939
when the rear of his automobile
was struck from behing

01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:37.342
by a car driven by the defendant,

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:38.860
Mile Rita Filagree.

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:43.256
In conclusion, your Honor,
I would like the jury

01:04:43.387 --> 01:04:45.025
to listen to a tape.

01:04:51.147 --> 01:04:54.537
Hey, Wally, being in court
is really neat stuff.

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:57.977
Knock it off! I don't want
the judge to yell at us.

01:04:58.107 --> 01:05:01.099
Are you prepared with your case?

01:05:01.227 --> 01:05:02.376
Yes I am, your Honor.

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:04.543
Then call your first witness.

01:05:12.427 --> 01:05:14.497
The number of a Sheldon Gunwald.

01:05:15.227 --> 01:05:17.104
That's me.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:20.107
Nevermind, operator, I found him myself.

01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:22.626
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,

01:05:22.787 --> 01:05:24.937
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

01:05:25.907 --> 01:05:26.942
I do.

01:05:27.107 --> 01:05:28.745
You've made me so happy!

01:05:33.907 --> 01:05:38.546
We will tell you only that Mr. Grunwald
is salaried, deals in a service,

01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:40.382
and we'll start the questioning
with Mr. Hornung.

01:05:40.747 --> 01:05:43.625
Mr. Grunwald, would I be more likely
to use your service

01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:45.738
than... let's say, my wife?

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:51.541
That's five down,
and forty-five to go.

01:05:52.027 --> 01:05:53.699
I think I'll pass to Arlene.

01:05:54.387 --> 01:05:58.426
Sorry, we're running short of time.
We'll flip all the cards now..

01:05:58.547 --> 01:06:01.937
And I'll tell you that, in fact,
Mr. Grunwald is a spoon.

01:06:12.187 --> 01:06:13.620
Mr. Grunwald,

01:06:13.747 --> 01:06:17.217
in addition to your
occupation as a spool...

01:06:17.347 --> 01:06:19.383
No, spoon!

01:06:19.787 --> 01:06:21.220
Ah yes, spoon.

01:06:22.947 --> 01:06:25.063
Of course, "spool" 
doesn't make much sense.

01:06:25.587 --> 01:06:30.342
Mr. Grunwald, in addition
to your occupation as a spoon, 

01:06:31.107 --> 01:06:34.383
is it not true that
you are a driving instructor?

01:06:34.507 --> 01:06:35.576
No.

01:06:36.427 --> 01:06:38.497
- Then it is true?
- Yes.

01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:41.139
That you're not
a driving instructor?

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:42.382
No.

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:45.144
Your Honor, I object
to this line of questioning.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.620
Overruled.

01:06:46.747 --> 01:06:48.942
Very well, then. 
I'd like some time to go over my briefs.

01:06:49.107 --> 01:06:50.335
Please.

01:06:54.227 --> 01:06:55.262
They're fine.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.139
Your witness, council.

01:06:58.907 --> 01:07:01.467
Please state your first name.

01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:06.501
Sheldon.

01:07:07.427 --> 01:07:08.985
Mr. Grunwald,

01:07:09.427 --> 01:07:12.703
what does ... that exactly mean?

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:15.580
Happy birthday to you...

01:07:15.707 --> 01:07:18.460
Happy birthday dear - Sheldon. 

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:24.180
Mr. Grunwald,

01:07:24.747 --> 01:07:28.535
would you kindly tell the court
the fabric of which your shirt is made?

01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:31.540
Objection! That shirt is immaterial.

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:32.986
Sustained.

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:34.860
Very well, then.

01:07:34.987 --> 01:07:39.344
Mr. Grunwald, please follow
me to the south end of the courtroom.

01:07:42.307 --> 01:07:44.502
Objection! The council
is leading the witness.

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:45.742
Sustained.

01:07:45.867 --> 01:07:50.065
Mr. Hornung, Mr. Taylor,
approach the bench.

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:55.222
While the judge conferres
with the attorneys,

01:07:55.347 --> 01:07:58.180
let's pause for this brief message.

01:08:02.707 --> 01:08:04.857
What is our little skeptic
doing today?

01:08:04.987 --> 01:08:07.820
She's frying the cat
in pure Nesson oil.

01:08:13.867 --> 01:08:17.823
The judge will ask Mr. Hornung
to show relevance.

01:08:17.987 --> 01:08:22.265
Mr. Hornung, you are going to
have to show relevance.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:24.457
Not only will I show relevance,

01:08:25.386 --> 01:08:28.345
I will show how these facts
relate to the case.

01:08:33.267 --> 01:08:35.258
I call to the stand,

01:08:36.027 --> 01:08:37.585
Miss Rita Filagree.

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:44.256
As everybody expected,
a surprise witness.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.743
Miss Filagree was a passenger
in the Grunwald vehicle,

01:08:47.867 --> 01:08:50.096
but was pronounced
dead at the scene.

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:53.816
I do.

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:57.975
Miss Filagree, as a passenger
in the Grunwald vehicle,

01:08:58.346 --> 01:09:01.464
can you identify the man
driving the blue Buick?

01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:03.055
Yes.

01:09:04.267 --> 01:09:06.542
Is he in this courtroom right now?

01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:08.816
Yes!

01:09:10.386 --> 01:09:12.617
Can you point him out to me?

01:09:12.907 --> 01:09:14.386
I can't do it.

01:09:14.506 --> 01:09:16.702
I just can't do it.

01:09:16.907 --> 01:09:19.740
Young lady, are you familiar with the
penal codes in this State?

01:09:20.426 --> 01:09:24.055
You would not cry, if you were just
getting yelled at, would you, Wally?

01:09:24.227 --> 01:09:26.661
Heck no, Beef!
But girls are different.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:29.823
If a guy cried, everybody would think
he was a creep or something.

01:09:29.947 --> 01:09:32.506
Gee, Wally. I guess you're right.

01:09:33.267 --> 01:09:34.541
Young lady,

01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:37.022
are you aware that to withhold evidence,

01:09:37.147 --> 01:09:41.581
pertinent to a crime, so heinious...
- No.

01:09:42.067 --> 01:09:43.897
- "Hineous"?
- No.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:44.935
"Hinéous."

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:47.263
I think it's pronounced "heenus"

01:09:47.386 --> 01:09:49.423
No, you wouldn't say "your heenus."

01:09:49.546 --> 01:09:52.743
No! Ladies and gentlemen,
I have it right here.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:54.136
"Hyenas":

01:09:54.347 --> 01:09:58.420
Any of a family of cowardly,
carnivorous beasts of Asia and Africa.

01:10:04.307 --> 01:10:05.626
Hey, look, Wally.

01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:08.106
Lay off, will you!

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.067
You see? I told you we'd get harred at.

01:10:14.907 --> 01:10:17.375
We mean no harm to your planet.

01:10:20.427 --> 01:10:24.022
Your Honor, the prosecution is making
a mockery of this courtroom!

01:10:24.867 --> 01:10:26.266
All right.

01:10:26.707 --> 01:10:28.663
He's sitting over there.

01:10:33.987 --> 01:10:36.217
Oh, no. Him!

01:10:37.987 --> 01:10:42.219
The bailiff is now trying to
the driver of the blue Buick.

01:10:42.867 --> 01:10:45.665
Everybody is, of course,
anxiously awaiting

01:10:45.787 --> 01:10:47.505
the identification
of the mystery driver.

01:10:47.627 --> 01:10:50.858
He could blow the case wide open.

01:10:50.987 --> 01:10:52.818
Perhaps the next person to...

01:10:53.147 --> 01:10:54.785
That's him!

01:10:56.347 --> 01:10:58.861
Announcer Steven McCrosky
was found guilty,

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:02.662
and sentenced to twenty years
in a federal penitentiary.

01:11:03.267 --> 01:11:06.976
Stenographer Gordon Simley
had a sex change operation,

01:11:07.107 --> 01:11:10.099
and is now a switch-hitter
for the Atlanta Braves.

01:11:10.427 --> 01:11:13.578
Wallace and Theodore Cleaver
had their allowance suspended, 

01:11:13.707 --> 01:11:16.221
and was sent to bed without supper.

01:11:27.787 --> 01:11:30.824
She was six feet of black dynamite.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.227
He was a short hasidic jew.

01:11:34.387 --> 01:11:37.815
She fought a savage battle
to stay alive in the ghetto.

01:11:37.947 --> 01:11:40.666
He studied the Talmud at night.. 

01:11:48.507 --> 01:11:50.975
While she burned the ghetto
to the ground,

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:53.940
he kindled the sabbath candles. 

01:12:04.067 --> 01:12:06.183
Theirs was a love of passion!

01:12:06.307 --> 01:12:11.142
A torrid sensual lust
fueled by those who said no!

01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:21.496
They alone dared to triumph
in a hellish inferno 

01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:23.424
of unrelenting desire. 

01:12:23.747 --> 01:12:27.342
Never before has the screen
unleashed such violent fury.

01:12:27.507 --> 01:12:28.940
Never again will one man 

01:12:29.067 --> 01:12:31.979
and one woman defy
such incredible odds.

01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:34.143
Together, 

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.576
no one could stop them. 

01:12:47.907 --> 01:12:49.135
Whether we know it or not, 

01:12:49.507 --> 01:12:52.340
chemicals play an important
and ever increasing role

01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:54.025
in our daily life. 

01:12:54.187 --> 01:12:57.975
One of the most widely used
chemical compounds

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.985
is zinc oxide.
This policeman, 

01:13:02.227 --> 01:13:03.376
this farmer, 

01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:05.937
and this housewife 
don't realize it, 

01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:09.264
but they all depend on zinc oxide
in their daily lives.

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:12.100
But how do I use zinc oxide?

01:13:12.227 --> 01:13:15.902
If it wasn't for zinc oxide,
you wouldn't have that bar of soap. 

01:13:16.787 --> 01:13:18.903
The dish towels you use every day.

01:13:20.827 --> 01:13:21.942
Your toaster.

01:13:22.867 --> 01:13:24.505
That brassiere you're wearing.

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:28.500
Your kitchen sink. 

01:13:30.347 --> 01:13:31.905
Those curtain rods. 

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:34.823
The shelves in your refrigerator. 

01:13:38.027 --> 01:13:39.426
Metal hooks. 

01:13:40.107 --> 01:13:42.018
The heat control on your stove. 

01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:49.858
The safety catch on your son's rifle. 
That fire extinguisher.

01:13:55.187 --> 01:13:57.337
The emergency brake on your car. 

01:14:02.107 --> 01:14:03.335
All brakes. 

01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:10.941
That blanket. 

01:14:11.787 --> 01:14:13.266
How about sand?

01:14:16.907 --> 01:14:18.659
Yes, sand. 

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:20.822
Oh, my God!

01:14:20.947 --> 01:14:22.699
Your husband's pacemaker. 

01:14:25.947 --> 01:14:27.539
Your artificial limb. 

01:14:29.387 --> 01:14:33.266
Yes, zinc oxide at work
in our daily life.

01:14:33.987 --> 01:14:36.262
Watch for
"Science series number seven":

01:14:44.867 --> 01:14:47.301
It's been said that
the test of a man's courage

01:14:47.427 --> 01:14:50.100
is how he performs in
the face of danger.

01:14:51.107 --> 01:14:54.986
You are gonna meet a very unique
breed of cat.

01:14:55.307 --> 01:14:58.663
The kind of man that doesn't know
the meaning of the word "fear".

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:03.298
Rex Kramer, part-time airplane
mechanic, full-time daredevil.

01:15:03.427 --> 01:15:07.340
A man willing to risk his life
for the sake of adventure.

01:15:07.507 --> 01:15:10.897
He has to chase it, confront it,
and whip it.

01:15:11.267 --> 01:15:14.577
Rex Kramer. Danger seeker. 

01:15:32.507 --> 01:15:34.259
Niggers!

01:15:58.427 --> 01:16:00.782
Turn on the tv,
I think the news is on

01:16:01.387 --> 01:16:02.786
Forget it!

01:16:05.307 --> 01:16:07.184
Come on, turn on the tv.

01:16:22.387 --> 01:16:26.175
Governor Billingsley goes
on trial today for extortion. 

01:16:26.467 --> 01:16:29.982
Billingsley is the fourth governor in U.S. history
to be tried for a crime while in office.

01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:33.179
U.S. attorney Mark Fielding
is the prosecutor,

01:16:33.307 --> 01:16:36.902
and Billingsley charges
that Fielding is trying to destroy him, 

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:39.985
and "hand pick the next governor." 

01:16:40.107 --> 01:16:42.143
Senator John Hammond 
of New Mexico says 

01:16:42.267 --> 01:16:46.340
that a report scheduled for release
next week, will embarass the CIA

01:16:46.507 --> 01:16:48.145
and the FBI. 

01:16:48.467 --> 01:16:50.935
The report will not damage the agencies,

01:16:51.067 --> 01:16:53.262
and recommend resignation
of any senator

01:16:53.387 --> 01:16:55.981
who leaks secret intellegency
information. 

01:16:57.507 --> 01:17:00.783
In Detroit, top officials
of the United Rubber Workers Union,

01:17:00.947 --> 01:17:03.666
are concentrating their
contract talks

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:06.506
on the big three
tire and rubber companies.

01:17:06.627 --> 01:17:08.857
Because of the wage price freeze
three years ago,

01:17:09.027 --> 01:17:11.985
the union didn't get a "cost
of living" clause in its contract

01:17:12.107 --> 01:17:14.667
and this time the URW is demanding

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:17.620
an unlimited "cost of living" clause.

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:21.143
The businesses are in turmoil
and traffic is at a standstill, 

01:17:21.267 --> 01:17:24.304
as more than 500,000
Japanese railway workers

01:17:24.427 --> 01:17:27.578
staged a three day strike
which began today.

01:17:27.707 --> 01:17:29.459
Officials say the strike disrupted

01:17:29.627 --> 01:17:31.345
the lifes of... 

01:17:35.547 --> 01:17:37.981
17 million city-dwellers
across Japan,

01:17:38.107 --> 01:17:41.179
who use trains
to get to work

01:17:41.307 --> 01:17:43.377
or to school.

01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:46.863
Commuters are scrambled to find
alternative ways

01:17:47.027 --> 01:17:50.463
to get to their jobs as
the traffic clogs Tokyo's streets.

01:17:51.187 --> 01:17:55.419
Tens of thousands of 
lower level employees

01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:57.543
were forced to stay in their desks...

01:17:57.667 --> 01:18:00.739
They camp out in desks and... 

01:18:00.867 --> 01:18:04.223
because clo...
stores were closing down.

01:18:04.627 --> 01:18:06.504
Strike... 

01:18:06.627 --> 01:18:09.619
... there is what's happening ...

01:18:09.747 --> 01:18:12.386
in Japan ... with those Japanese. 

01:18:14.707 --> 01:18:17.096
Prices on the stock market
softened this afternoon

01:18:17.227 --> 01:18:19.946
from readings earlier in the day

01:18:20.107 --> 01:18:21.779
as the pace of trading is slacking.

01:18:24.827 --> 01:18:26.340
... tributes the stabilisation

01:18:26.467 --> 01:18:30.699
to the recent deregulation
of foreign imports.

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:34.458
A tragedy struck the new
Hitchcock home development today,

01:18:34.587 --> 01:18:37.147
when a gas explosion ripped through

01:18:37.267 --> 01:18:38.666
their recreation center.

01:18:39.587 --> 01:18:42.863
The explosion claimed
the life of the owner

01:18:43.067 --> 01:18:45.945
of the development,
Mr. James Hitchcock... 

01:18:47.507 --> 01:18:50.021
and his entire family of five. 

01:18:50.147 --> 01:18:52.900
Three others were injured

01:18:53.107 --> 01:18:54.859
and two are listed as missing. 

01:19:14.227 --> 01:19:15.660
Sudan revealed evidence, ehh, 

01:19:16.067 --> 01:19:19.264
wednesday night, that colonel
Hernando Escalante of Libya

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:24.177
is trying to buy fruits...
and arms... and legs...

01:19:25.267 --> 01:19:29.656
to Uganda to assist
president Adi Amin.

01:20:00.507 --> 01:20:03.226
Goodnight and thank you 

01:20:03.347 --> 01:20:04.575
for joining us

01:20:06.347 --> 01:20:08.303

01:20:15.707 --> 01:20:18.904
I'm not wearing any pants.
