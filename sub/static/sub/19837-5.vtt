<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.280 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:01.880 --> 02:04.210
<b>I see, I see...</b>

02:04.700 --> 02:06.540
<b>That settles it...</b>

02:06.540 --> 02:08.560
<b>You're the real one.</b>

02:11.900 --> 02:14.090
<b>Examiners are Hunters</b>

02:14.090 --> 02:18.900
<b>selected by the committee to perform 
this duty without pay.</b>

02:19.290 --> 02:22.910
<b>Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek,</b>

02:22.910 --> 02:27.160
<b>would have been able to block that attack.</b>

02:27.160 --> 02:30.000
<b>I shall take that as a compliment.</b>

02:30.750 --> 02:35.690
<b>However, should you attack me again, 
for any reason,</b>

02:35.690 --> 02:38.210
<b>I will report you for turning 
on an examiner.</b>

02:38.210 --> 02:40.730
<b>And you will be immediately disqualified.</b>

02:41.060 --> 02:42.050
<b>Are we clear?</b>

02:42.420 --> 02:43.510
<b>Sure.</b>

<b>Hisoka x Is x Sneaky</b>

<b>The 368 applicants who made it through

02:57.800 --> 03:01.220
<b>find themselves in an unexplored land 
teeming with strange creatures,</b>

03:01.220 --> 03:04.550
<b>known as the Numere Wetlands.</b>

03:13.280 --> 03:14.440
<b>Pay attention now.</b>

03:14.440 --> 03:17.840
<b>Be sure to stay close behind me.</b>

03:57.890 --> 04:00.260
<b>The fog is getting thicker.</b>

04:05.280 --> 04:06.210
<b>All right...</b>

04:06.210 --> 04:07.360
<b>This is our chance.</b>

04:08.300 --> 04:11.220
<b>We'll take advantage of the fog

04:18.630 --> 04:19.530
<b>Gon...</b>

04:19.530 --> 04:20.700
<b>Huh?</b>

04:20.700 --> 04:22.410
<b>Let's move up.</b>

04:22.410 --> 04:23.450
<b>Okay.</b>

04:23.450 --> 04:26.500
<b>We don't want to lose sight 
of the examiner.</b>

04:26.500 --> 04:27.870
<b>I'm more concerned with</b>

04:27.870 --> 04:29.790
<b>increasing the distance between 
us and Hisoka.</b>

04:30.100 --> 04:32.660
<b>Staying too close to him is dangerous.</b>

04:33.320 --> 04:34.950
<b>I can smell it in the air.</b>

04:35.960 --> 04:37.380
<b>Smell?</b>

04:39.040 --> 04:40.430
<b>Hmm...</b>

04:40.430 --> 04:42.420
<b>I don't think he smells.</b>

04:42.420 --> 04:45.150
<b>Leorio! Kurapika!</b>

04:45.150 --> 04:48.520
<b>Killua says that we should move up!</b>

04:48.520 --> 04:49.350
<b>Hey...</b>

04:49.350 --> 04:51.680
<b>Can't you feel the tension 
surrounding us?</b>

04:51.680 --> 04:53.170
<b>Moron!</b>

04:53.170 --> 04:55.810
<b>If I had the strength, 
I'd already be there!</b>

04:55.810 --> 04:57.560
<b>Don't worry about us!</b>

04:58.020 --> 04:59.570
<b>What?</b>

04:59.990 --> 05:01.260
<b>Let's go, Gon.</b>

05:01.870 --> 05:03.430
<b>Ah, wait!</b>

05:10.580 --> 05:14.810
<b>We can't even tell 
which way we're going.</b>

05:14.810 --> 05:15.710
<b>It's okay.</b>

05:16.090 --> 05:19.340
<b>As long as we don't lose sight 
of the guys ahead of us...</b>

05:26.180 --> 05:27.840
<b>What's going on?</b>

<b>Huh? What?</b>

<b>Damn!</b>

07:02.450 --> 07:04.480
<b>Which way are we supposed to go?</b>

07:04.480 --> 07:06.370
<b>Did we lose sight of him?</b>

07:06.930 --> 07:08.900
<b>Pay attention now.</b>

07:08.900 --> 07:13.530
<b>Be sure to stay close behind me.</b>

07:13.990 --> 07:14.910
<b>Over there!</b>

07:30.410 --> 07:32.620
<b>Pay attention now.</b>

07:32.620 --> 07:34.430
<b>Caw!</b>

<b>Be sure to stay close behind me.</b>

<b>That thing can imitate human speech?</b>

07:43.330 --> 07:44.930
<b>Close call...</b>

07:44.930 --> 07:46.320
<b>Yeah...</b>

07:49.040 --> 07:52.320
<b>I hear people screaming all around us.</b>

07:52.320 --> 07:54.790
<b>Just stay on your guard.</b>

07:54.790 --> 07:57.830
<b>I wonder if Leorio and

08:00.170 --> 08:00.800
<b>Mm?</b>

08:09.860 --> 08:12.340
<b>Frog-in-Waiting</b>

08:24.810 --> 08:25.650
<b>Leorio!</b>

08:47.950 --> 08:48.850
<b>Ouch.</b>

08:49.710 --> 08:51.550
<b>Leorio, here's our opportunity.</b>

08:51.550 --> 08:53.300
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

09:15.960 --> 09:19.000
<b>Guess he didn't like the taste of us.</b>

09:19.000 --> 09:20.080
<b>It was this.</b>

09:20.880 --> 09:22.700
<b>That was from Tonpa-san!</b>

09:23.170 --> 09:25.020
<b>Guess he saved us.</b>

09:25.020 --> 09:28.350
<b>Well, I could have escaped.</b>

09:29.600 --> 09:32.670
<b>I'm still worried about Leorio and Kurapika.</b>

09:33.640 --> 09:36.130
<b>Forget about them. Let's get a move on.</b>

09:36.130 --> 09:38.220
<b>We can still catch up to the examiner.</b>

09:47.680 --> 09:50.310
<b>We've lost sight of the front-runners.</b>

09:51.700 --> 09:52.980
<b>Which way should we go?</b>

09:57.990 --> 09:58.990
<b>Stop!</b>

09:59.980 --> 10:01.150
<b>Over there...</b>

10:10.130 --> 10:12.130
<b>When I saw you last year,</b>

10:12.130 --> 10:15.390
<b>I knew you weren't Hunter material.</b>

10:15.390 --> 10:19.010
<b>We'll spare you if you swear not to 
take the Hunter Exam again.</b>

10:19.540 --> 10:20.840
<b>Sure.</b>

10:20.840 --> 10:21.690
<b>Huh?</b>

10:21.690 --> 10:23.170
<b>I'm passing the exam this year,</b>

10:23.170 --> 10:24.630
<b>so I won't need to retake it.</b>

10:24.630 --> 10:25.690
<b>Passing?</b>

10:25.690 --> 10:26.650
<b>Idiot!</b>

10:26.650 --> 10:28.220
<b>Look at this fog.</b>

10:28.220 --> 10:32.250
<b>It's impossible to determine which 
direction the main pack went!</b>

10:32.250 --> 10:36.650
<b>Meaning we've all failed the exam!</b>

10:38.310 --> 10:40.170
<b>So that's why.</b>

10:40.170 --> 10:43.030
<b>Having already failed, you wish 
to play examiner.</b>

10:43.370 --> 10:45.700
<b>Hunters require prey.</b>

10:45.700 --> 10:47.910
<b>Why don't I play examiner...</b>

10:47.910 --> 10:53.050
<b>And judge whether you 
are Hunter material?</b>

10:55.800 --> 10:58.800
<b>Shut up!</b>

11:27.590 --> 11:29.080
<b>Now, then...</b>

11:36.570 --> 11:39.520
<b>H-H-Help!</b>

11:40.420 --> 11:41.260
<b>Helâ€”</b>

11:55.620 --> 11:56.730
<b>Well?</b>

11:58.290 --> 12:00.070
<b>Care to participate,</b>

12:00.580 --> 12:03.070
<b>in my little game of examiner?</b>

<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

12:14.000 --> 12:18.170
<b>Satotz</b>

12:29.830 --> 12:31.090
<b>Cool...</b>

12:31.090 --> 12:33.810
<b>We've caught up to the 
main group, Gon.</b>

12:35.270 --> 12:36.400
<b>Huh?</b>

12:36.400 --> 12:38.550
<b>Where'd he go?</b>

12:54.860 --> 12:56.170
<b>Leorio.</b>

12:56.170 --> 12:59.380
<b>On my signal, we run in 
opposite directions.</b>

12:59.380 --> 13:00.440
<b>What?</b>

13:00.440 --> 13:05.620
<b>He is vastly more experienced 
in real combat.</b>

13:06.100 --> 13:09.100
<b>The two of us won't stand a 
chance against him.</b>

13:09.100 --> 13:13.740
<b>We cannot afford to squander time 
in a pointless fight!</b>

13:39.620 --> 13:40.250
<b>Now!</b>

13:50.510 --> 13:52.160
<b>I see...</b>

13:52.160 --> 13:54.350
<b>A wise decision.</b>

14:03.390 --> 14:04.280
<b>Hmm?</b>

14:11.010 --> 14:13.290
<b>I just can't do it...</b>

14:14.360 --> 14:18.300
<b>This may not be my fight,</b>

14:19.460 --> 14:22.180
<b>but I won't close my eyes</b>

14:23.250 --> 14:26.920
<b>and make a break for it!</b>

14:27.630 --> 14:28.680
<b>Leorio?!</b>

14:32.460 --> 14:35.680
<b>Mm, I adore that look on your face.</b>

14:41.860 --> 14:42.730
<b>What?</b>

15:08.570 --> 15:09.800
<b>Gon?</b>

15:09.800 --> 15:11.420
<b>I made it in time...</b>

15:14.900 --> 15:17.770
<b>Not bad, little boy.</b>

15:19.560 --> 15:21.610
<b>Is that a fishing pole?</b>

15:21.610 --> 15:23.720
<b>What a fascinating weapon.</b>

15:30.670 --> 15:33.030
<b>Allow me a closer look.</b>

15:35.160 --> 15:37.660
<b>Your fight is with</b>

15:37.660 --> 15:40.250
<b>me!</b>

15:51.090 --> 15:53.550
<b>You came to rescue your friend?</b>

15:56.010 --> 15:57.770
<b>Such a good boy.</b>

16:00.480 --> 16:02.390
<b>And that expression...</b>

16:08.730 --> 16:09.880
<b>Nice...</b>

16:10.880 --> 16:12.320
<b>Very nice.</b>

16:13.050 --> 16:15.400
<b>I'm getting excited now...</b>

16:17.510 --> 16:18.410
<b>Okay!</b>

16:48.160 --> 16:50.860
<b>How wonderful...</b>

16:56.180 --> 16:58.990
<b>I really do love that look.</b>

17:07.500 --> 17:09.110
<b>Do not fear.</b>

17:10.460 --> 17:13.420
<b>I will not kill your friend.</b>

17:14.580 --> 17:16.930
<b>He passed.</b>

17:21.060 --> 17:24.220
<b>Yes, you pass, as well.</b>

17:24.220 --> 17:26.690
<b>Grow up and become a fine Hunter.</b>

17:31.400 --> 17:33.970
<b>Hisoka, you should get back here.</b>

17:33.970 --> 17:37.450
<b>We're nearly at the Phase Two site.</b>

17:37.450 --> 17:39.660
<b>Okay, I'll be right there.</b>

17:42.340 --> 17:45.010
<b>It's always good to have friends.</b>

17:47.900 --> 17:49.960
<b>You can find your own way back, yes?</b>

17:53.960 --> 17:55.880
<b>That's a good boy.</b>

18:13.450 --> 18:14.320
<b>Gon!</b>

18:15.150 --> 18:16.260
<b>Are you all right?</b>

18:33.020 --> 18:34.600
<b>Huh?</b>

18:34.600 --> 18:37.480
<b>Gon isn't here...</b>

18:56.280 --> 18:57.650
<b>This way.</b>

18:58.610 --> 19:01.010
<b>You can really tell?</b>

19:01.010 --> 19:02.160
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

19:02.160 --> 19:05.610
<b>Leorio's cologne is very unique.</b>

19:05.610 --> 19:08.580
<b>I can smell him from a 
few kilometers away.</b>

19:15.710 --> 19:17.710
<b>Say, Kurapika...</b>

19:17.710 --> 19:21.720
<b>What did Hisoka mean when 
he said that we passed?</b>

19:23.460 --> 19:26.820
<b>Hisoka was acting as a judge.</b>

19:26.820 --> 19:28.120
<b>A judge?</b>

19:28.120 --> 19:29.060
<b>Yes.</b>

19:29.900 --> 19:34.100
<b>He must have his own benchmarks 
for evaluating power.</b>

19:34.100 --> 19:37.400
<b>It's possible that he was ascertaining 
each applicant's strength.</b>

19:38.440 --> 19:43.230
<b>Apparently, you and Leorio must 
have met his standards.</b>

19:44.270 --> 19:45.520
<b>I see.</b>

19:45.520 --> 19:49.160
<b>But I was powerless to do 
anything against him.</b>

19:49.490 --> 19:52.370
<b>Didn't you land your first hit on him?</b>

19:52.370 --> 19:54.540
<b>Only because I surprised him.</b>

19:54.540 --> 19:59.130
<b>Besides, Leorio passed, 
even though he lost...</b>

20:00.170 --> 20:01.370
<b>Hmm...</b>

20:01.370 --> 20:05.640
<b>Perhaps he sensed that you 
were kindred spirits.</b>

20:06.100 --> 20:07.390
<b>Kindred spirits?</b>

20:07.770 --> 20:13.060
<b>I seriously doubt that Hisoka 
could qualify as a Hunter.</b>

20:13.810 --> 20:15.110
<b>However,</b>

20:15.110 --> 20:17.730
<b>I must admit that he did impress me</b>

20:17.730 --> 20:22.110
<b>with his superhuman agility 
and graceful technique.</b>

20:22.820 --> 20:25.160
<b>It's quite common that those</b>

20:25.160 --> 20:28.770
<b>possessing special talents are drawn 
to others with unique gifts.</b>

20:28.770 --> 20:32.100
<b>Most likely, Hisoka's instincts 
and experience</b>

20:32.100 --> 20:36.590
<b>told him that you had the skill and 
potential to become Hunters.</b>

20:39.160 --> 20:41.590
<b>Killing you now would have been a waste...</b>

20:41.590 --> 20:44.130
<b>That was his perspective.</b>

20:46.540 --> 20:48.090
<b>Oh, I'm sorry!</b>

20:48.090 --> 20:49.970
<b>Was that insensitive on my part?</b>

20:49.970 --> 20:51.390
<b>No...</b>

20:51.390 --> 20:55.060
<b>But I was pretty excited, as well.</b>

20:56.300 --> 20:59.490
<b>I was so scared, I wanted to run away.</b>

20:59.490 --> 21:01.320
<b>But I couldn't.</b>

21:01.320 --> 21:03.900
<b>And at the same time, I was excited.</b>

21:03.900 --> 21:05.320
<b>Isn't that strange?</b>

21:29.540 --> 21:33.310
<b>For the first time in his life, 
Gon has experienced mortal fear.</b>

21:34.220 --> 21:38.710
<b>Though the unfamiliar feelings 
accompanying that fear confuse Gon,</b>

21:38.710 --> 21:43.820
<b>he cannot restrain his growing curiosity.</b>

21:47.030 --> 21:51.420
<b>At this stage, 220 candidates have 
withdrawn from the exam,</b>

21:51.420 --> 21:54.580
<b>leaving 148 remaining applicants.</b>

23:27.380 --> 23:29.960
<b>Next time: A x Surprising x Challenge!</b>

23:29.960 --> 23:32.120
<b>S-Surprisingly challenging.</b>

23:32.120 --> 23:32.850
<b>Huh?</b>

23:32.850 --> 23:34.300
<b>Gon, are you okay?</b>
