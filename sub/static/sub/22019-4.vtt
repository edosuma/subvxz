WE WERE ON THE ROOF

01:58.780 --> 02:00.270
AND I WAS TRYING
TO BOX HIM IN.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.925

02:24.340 --> 02:26.228

IN THE HEAD AND TORSO.

06:58.810 --> 07:01.119
HOW MANY SHOTS
DID BELL FIRE?

07:01.150 --> 07:03.880
NONE. HIS FIREARM
WAS IN HIS HAND

07:03.920 --> 07:05.512
WHEN WE FOUND THE BODY,
BUT IT HADN'T BEEN FIRED.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.983
HE MIGHT HAVE
RECOGNIZED THE GUNMAN.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.783
THAT COULD HAVE
MADE HIM HESITATE.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.653
HE WAS TRAINED
TO RETURN FIRE.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.555
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.819
IT WAS CRAZY, TOTAL CHAOS.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.088
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.496
THEN, AFTER
THE SHOOTING STOPPED,

07:21.540 --> 07:23.462
I RAN TOWARD
THE FRONT OF THE ROOM

07:23.510 --> 07:24.659
TO SEE IF I COULD HELP.

07:24.710 --> 07:25.665
DID YOU SEE

07:25.710 --> 07:27.769
YEAH, I SAW HIM,

07:27.810 --> 07:29.004
BUT NOT HIS FACE,

07:29.040 --> 07:32.100
BUT HE WAS WEARING
A BLACK SHIRT.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.916
HE RAN OUT THE EMERGENCY
EXIT OVER THERE.

07:35.950 --> 07:38.487
HE PULLED A FIRE ALARM
AS HE RAN OUT.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.919
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
THE SHOOTING WAS COMING FROM,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.882
SO WHEN THERE WAS A PAUSE,
I JUST MADE A RUN

07:41.920 --> 07:44.855
FOR THE EMERGENCY EXIT.
THAT ONE.

07:44.890 --> 07:46.255
THERE'S A FIRE ALARM
ON THAT WALL.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.928
ARE YOU THE ONE
THAT PULLED IT?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.996
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
I HOPED IT MIGHT

07:50.030 --> 07:52.089
STARTLE THE SHOOTER,
MAKE HIM STOP.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.997
I WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.837
I SAW HIM GET SHOT.

07:56.870 --> 08:00.874
I'M SORRY. I KNOW--
I KNOW IT WAS TRAUMATIC.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.878
DID YOU SEE THE SHOOTER?

08:02.910 --> 08:04.571
I DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM,

08:04.610 --> 08:06.646
BUT I HEARD HIM.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.786
HE YELLED,
"EVERYBODY GET DOWN."

08:09.820 --> 08:11.788
AND THEN HE RAN
BACK THAT WAY

08:11.820 --> 08:13.617
TOWARDS THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.809
SO YOU WERE IN
THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

08:14.860 --> 08:15.952
I'M A TEAM LEADER.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.127
I WAS RUNNING
A MARKETING MEETING

08:17.160 --> 08:18.184
FOR MY PROJECT GROUP.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.697
AND WERE YOU AWARE

08:19.730 --> 08:20.697
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
OUT HERE?

08:20.730 --> 08:21.958
WE HEARD THE SHOTS.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.266
I RAN OUT. I JUST
WANTED TO WARN PEOPLE.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.733
I SHOUTED,
"EVERYBODY GET DOWN,"

08:27.770 --> 08:29.806
AND THEN I DOUBLED BACK.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.877
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
THEY SAW A LOT OF THINGS,

08:32.910 --> 08:34.002
NOT ALL OF IT ACCURATE.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.645

NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE,

08:36.680 --> 08:38.272
ESPECIALLY IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.040
YEAH, A VERY VIOLENT,
CHAOTIC SCENE.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.310
ANXIETY SPIKES,
MAKES IT DIFFICULT

08:43.350 --> 08:46.148
FOR PEOPLE TO OBSERVE
AND RECREATE EVENTS.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.919
WELL, ONE THING EVERYBODY
SEEMS TO AGREE ON

08:47.960 --> 08:50.053
IS THAT ABDELLA
WAS KILLED FIRST,

08:50.090 --> 08:51.819
AND THEN
THERE WAS A PAUSE,

08:51.860 --> 08:53.896
FOLLOWED BY
TWO BURSTS OF GUNFIRE

08:53.930 --> 08:55.818

A FEW SECONDS EACH.

MUST HAVE USED

08:57.270 --> 08:59.795
AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
THERE'S NO NEED TO RELOAD.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.968
OK, SO DEVLIN

09:15.850 --> 09:16.680
THAT THE MOTIVE WAS PERSONAL.

THAT MANY ROUNDS FIRED,

THERE WERE ONLY
A HANDFUL OF STRAYS.

ARE RARE, I KNOW.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.478
NATHAN KATZ WORKED
IN MOTION CAPTURE

18:06.510 --> 18:09.115
AND JOSH ABBOTT IN
MOBILE PLATFORMS.

18:09.150 --> 18:11.243
SO THE COMMON THREAD
IS VIDEO GAMES.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.643
THAT'S TOO BROAD.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.851
AND SOMETHING ELSE.
LOOK, EACH ONE OF THE VICTIMS

18:14.890 --> 18:17.484
WAS UNEMPLOYED FOR
APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS

18:17.530 --> 18:19.555
IN 2016.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.591
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.359
THE DATES DON'T
COMPLETELY OVERLAP,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.426
BUT THEY ALL FALL
BETWEEN FEBRUARY
AND JULY OF 2016.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.189
QUESTION IS,
WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.333
THERE'S 4 MORE CODERS DEAD

18:30.370 --> 18:31.701
AND ALL OF THEM ON THE TEAM.

18:31.740 --> 18:34.402
THAT MAKES 6.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.829
I KNOW. I THOUGHT IT WAS
A COINCIDENCE, TOO, AT FIRST,

18:36.880 --> 18:39.474
BUT NOW...

18:39.510 --> 18:42.240
I KNOW, THE SEVENTH ONE, BUT--

18:42.280 --> 18:44.646
IT CAN'T ALL BE ARBITRARY,
ALL RIGHT?

18:44.690 --> 18:47.614
AND I CAN'T JUST PRETEND
LIKE IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.480
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

18:49.520 --> 18:52.683
OH! OH, GOD, IT'S HIM!

18:52.730 --> 18:54.698
IT'S HIM!

18:56.730 --> 18:58.823
OHH!

18:58.870 --> 19:00.667
[CELL PHONE CHIRPS]

19:06.270 --> 19:09.603
HEY, TORI, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:16.420 --> 19:18.388
[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]

19:21.790 --> 19:24.350
[SIREN IN DISTANCE]

19:24.390 --> 19:27.291
CAR IS REGISTERED
TO TORI HOFFSTADT.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.321
GARCIA SAID TORI
WAS ON HER PHONE

19:29.360 --> 19:30.759
AT THE TIME
THIS HAPPENED,

19:30.800 --> 19:32.495
BUT HER NUMBER'S
ENCRYPTED,
SO SHE CAN'T TRACK IT.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.929
TORI WORKS FOR PEAKSTONE.

19:33.970 --> 19:36.359
AND IF SHE HAS ACCESS
TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.459
HER CALLS
COULD BE ENCRYPTED
FOR SECURITY REASONS.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.331
PEAKSTONE. PRIVATE
MILITARY CONSULTING FIRM?

19:41.380 --> 19:44.474
YEAH. I WORKED WITH
SOME OF THEIR CONTRACTORS

19:44.510 --> 19:45.499
IN AFGHANISTAN.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.313
THOSE GUYS
ARE A DIFFERENT BREED.

19:47.350 --> 19:50.615
THEY'RE NOT QUITE CIVILIAN
AND NOT QUITE MILITARY.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.515
PEAKSTONE'S A VERY
POWERFUL COMPANY.

19:52.550 --> 19:54.916
THEY PROVIDE THE MILITARY
WITH CIVILIAN DRONE OPERATORS,

19:54.960 --> 19:57.884
AND THAT COULD BE
OUR PEAKSTONE CONNECTION
TO THE UNSUB.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.750
BUT WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST KILL HER RIGHT HERE?

19:59.790 --> 20:02.657
WHY ABDUCT HER?
IT'S A DEPARTURE
FROM HIS M.O.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.429
AGENT PRENTISS, A WORD?

20:04.470 --> 20:05.664
SURE.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.533
THIS ISN'T LIKE
A GARDEN VARIETY PSYCHO, IS IT?

20:08.570 --> 20:10.435
I'M SORRY, WHAT I MEAN IS,

20:10.470 --> 20:11.960
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
THE LEAD ON THIS.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.331
YOU NO LONGER WANT
TO TAKE LEAD ON THIS?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.608
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND,
WE'LL STILL PROVIDE

20:15.640 --> 20:18.245
PHYSICAL RESOURCES
AND MANPOWER, BUT...

20:18.280 --> 20:19.406
THE CASE IS YOURS.

20:19.450 --> 20:21.372
AND YOU'RE SURE
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

20:21.420 --> 20:23.513
YOU WANTING TO STEER
CLEAR OF PEAKSTONE?

20:23.550 --> 20:26.348
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE
THAT THE TEAM WITH
THE GREATEST PROFICIENCY

20:26.390 --> 20:27.652
TAKES THE HELM.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.821
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

20:32.860 --> 20:35.294
JUST DRIVE.

20:35.330 --> 20:38.458
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU, TORI?

20:38.500 --> 20:39.694
I DO.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.528
I WAS JUST ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR GAMEBOY RECRUITS.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.333
A DIME A DOZEN, RIGHT?

20:44.370 --> 20:48.477
I REMEMBER YOU, JAKE.

20:48.510 --> 20:52.002
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.574
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

20:53.620 --> 20:54.769
YOU DON'T GET TO
ASK QUESTIONS!

20:54.820 --> 20:56.344
AND YOU DON'T GET ANSWERS!

20:56.380 --> 20:58.712
JUST DO WHAT
I TELL YOU TO DO.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.389
TORI HOFFSTADT FREELANCED
FOR PEAKSTONE.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.980
SHE WAS IN CHARGE
OF PUTTING TOGETHER

21:04.030 --> 21:05.850
AND SUPERVISING DRONE TEAMS.

21:05.890 --> 21:09.519
A DRONE TEAM CONSISTED OF 6
CODERS AND ONE DRONE PILOT.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.599
THE CODERS WERE SUPPOSED
TO CREATE A MILITARY DRONE

21:13.640 --> 21:16.461
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED
TO APPEAL TO GAMERS.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.502
BECAUSE BLOWING AWAY
COMPUTER GRAPHICS

21:18.540 --> 21:20.405
IS EXACTLY THE SAME
AS KILLING HUMAN BEINGS?

21:20.440 --> 21:21.976
OK, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

21:22.010 --> 21:24.706
THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY BE INTO
FIRST-PERSON SHOOT-'EM-UP GAMES

21:24.750 --> 21:26.809
AND BE A COMPLETE PACIFIST,
BUT I GUESS

21:26.850 --> 21:29.944
THE MARKETING BEHIND THIS
WAS USING YOUR GAMING EXPERTISE

21:29.980 --> 21:32.813
TO DO SOMETHING PATRIOTIC,
AND THE PAY WAS REALLY GOOD.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.556
WELL, THEY NEEDED
THE RECRUITS.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.751
OUR ENLISTED MEN AND WOMEN
ARE STRETCHED TO THE LIMITS.

21:36.790 --> 21:39.486
NO ONE WANTS A DRAI-T,
SO CONTRACTORS TAKE OVER.

21:39.530 --> 21:42.624
THEIR MARKETING WORKED.
HUNDREDS OF DRONE OPERATORS

21:42.660 --> 21:44.093
WERE STATIONED OVERSEAS

21:44.130 --> 21:47.463
AND EMBEDDED WITH VARIOUS
AIR FORCE SQUADRONS.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.762
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
OVERWHELMING

21:48.800 --> 21:50.939
TO GUYS RECRUITED
FOR THEIR ABILITY
TO HANG OUT

21:50.970 --> 21:53.109
IN THEIR MOM'S BASEMENT
PLAYING "CALL OF DUTY."

21:53.140 --> 21:54.732
IF OUR UNSUB IS A FORMER
DRONE OPERATOR,

21:54.780 --> 21:56.577
IT COULD ALSO EXPLAIN
WHY HE'S TARGETING THE CODERS

21:56.610 --> 21:57.941
WHO DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.607
HE COULD HOLD
THEM RESPONSIBLE

21:59.650 --> 22:01.572
FOR MAKING KILLING
SEEM LIKE A GAME.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.678
PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T
IN ACTIVE COMBAT

22:02.720 --> 22:04.381
BUT STILL RACKED UP
CASUALTIES,

22:04.420 --> 22:05.978
THEY CAN SUFFER
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.512
BUT, GARCIA, DID TORI
BUT TOGETHER A TEAM

22:09.560 --> 22:11.653
DURING THE EMPLOYMENT
GAPS OF OUR VICTIMS?

22:11.690 --> 22:15.592
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETWEEN FEBRUARY
AND JULY OF 2016.

22:15.630 --> 22:19.122
SHE DID, AND IT PRODUCED
A DRONE THAT WAS USED

22:19.170 --> 22:21.491
IN STRIKES AGAINST
ENEMY TARGETS

22:21.540 --> 22:26.000
UNTIL JULY 2016
WHEN THE CONTRACT

22:26.040 --> 22:28.429
WAS ABRUPTLY CANCELED
BY PEAKSTONE.

22:28.480 --> 22:29.674
ANY SPECULATION
AS TO WHY?

22:29.710 --> 22:31.644
NONE. ACCORDING TO
OFFICIAL REPORTS,

22:31.680 --> 22:34.513
THE FINAL MISSION
WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.

22:34.550 --> 22:38.418
IT WAS AN INSURGENTS CAMP
IN THE HELMAND PROVINCE

22:38.450 --> 22:39.610
OF AFGHANISTAN.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.151
A LOT OF CASUALTIES.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.953
372 DEAD.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.686
GARCIA, WE NEED THE NAME
OF THAT CIVILIAN DRONE OPERATOR.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.459
HE'S OUR UNSUB.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.853
I KNOW THAT. I KNOW THAT.
DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.697
BUT PEAKSTONE
HAS ITS DATA IN A VAULT.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.129
I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.935
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D REMEMBER ME.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.733
I DO.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.101
I WAS SO HAPPY
WHEN YOU JOINED THE TEAM.

23:03.140 --> 23:06.678
YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE
I'D JUST BE PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.541
THE SOFTWARE WAS A LOT
LIKE A VIDEO GAME.

23:08.580 --> 23:12.038
YOU GAVE INPUT
ON THE DESIGN, REMEMBER?

23:12.090 --> 23:15.958
YEAH. BUT IT
WASN'T A GAME.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.527
NO. IT WASN'T A GAME.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.790
YOU WERE FIGHTING
FOR OUR COUNTRY.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.798
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR SERVICE.

23:22.830 --> 23:26.721
I WANTED TO BE.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.795
BUT I'M NOT LIKE
THE ENLISTED GUYS.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.638
YOU SERVED WITH THEM,
SIDE BY SIDE.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.706
THOSE FLYBOYS LOOKED DOWN
THEIR NOSES AT ME,

23:33.740 --> 23:35.571
SAID I NEVER REALLY
PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE,

23:35.610 --> 23:37.009
JUST STAYED SAFE
AND JUST KILLED

23:37.040 --> 23:38.746
WITH THE FLICK
OF A BUTTON.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.714
THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.809
EVERYONE HAS A PART
TO PLAY.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.989
YOU WERE JUST DOING
YOUR PART.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.647
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY CALLED IT?

23:46.690 --> 23:49.716
THEY CALLED IT
CUTTING THE GRASS.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.752
YOU GOTTA CUT THE GRASS
BEFORE IT GETS TOO TALL.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.798
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

23:59.830 --> 24:01.491
THEY'D TELL US
TO PULL THE WEEDS

24:01.540 --> 24:02.768
BEFORE THEY TOOK OVER
THE GARDEN.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.631
DID YOU EVER
HEAR THAT ONE?

24:04.670 --> 24:07.707
I NEVER HEARD THAT.
THAT'S--THAT'S CLEVER.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.071
NO, IT'S NOT.

24:09.110 --> 24:11.044
BECAUSE PEOPLE
AREN'T GRASS.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.105
AND PEOPLE AREN'T WEEDS.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.742
THEY'RE TERRORISTS.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.613
YOU WERE DOING
WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE,

24:17.650 --> 24:21.689
KEEPING THE PEOPLE
OF THIS COUNTRY SAFE.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.520
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE
PEOPLE ON THE SCREENS.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.824
THEY JUST LOOK
LIKE SHADOWS.

24:29.260 --> 24:33.697
BLACK AND GRAY SMUDGES
MOVING ACROSS THE DESERT.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.707
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY CALLED THE LITTLE ONES?

24:39.740 --> 24:42.800
I DON'T KNOW.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.277
FUN-SIZE TERRORISTS.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.948
LIKE THE CANDY BARS.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.912
THEY WERE JUST KIDS.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.817
LITTLE KIDS.

24:55.860 --> 24:59.489
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, JAKE?

25:02.060 --> 25:03.721
YOU KNOW.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.628
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH CLASSIFIED
MILITARY INFORMATION.

25:12.670 --> 25:15.275
INTEL LIKE THAT
IS BEYOND MY CAPABILITY.

25:15.310 --> 25:18.575
YOU'RE HOMELAND SECURITY.
YOU HAVE MILITARY CONNECTIONS.

25:18.610 --> 25:21.716
I NEED THE NAME
OF THE CIVILIAN DRONE
OPERATOR ON THE TEAM.

25:21.750 --> 25:22.842
HE'S OUR UNSUB.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.188
THE MILITARY
DOESN'T HAVE HIS NAME.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.188
SO WHO HAS IT?

25:26.220 --> 25:28.051
ONLY THE PEOPLE
THAT HIRED HIM.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.648
PEAKSTONE.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.749
YES. BUT THE EMPLOYMENT
RECORDS ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

25:31.790 --> 25:33.257
THEY'RE NOT EVEN SUBJECT
TO SUBPOENA.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.827
THIS UNSUB HAS MURDERED
7 PEOPLE

25:35.860 --> 25:37.760
AND IS HOLDING A HOSTAGE.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.961
YOU CAN HELP US
SAVE HER LIFE.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.861
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.798
YOU KNOW SOMEONE
AT PEAKSTONE.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.966
I'M ASKING YOU TO REACH OUT.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.136
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.273
PEAKSTONE WON'T
RELEASE THE NAME.

25:50.310 --> 25:52.642
THEN GIVE ME THE NAME
OF YOUR CONTACT

25:52.680 --> 25:55.114
AND I WILL TRY.
I WILL TAKE ALL THE BLOWBACK.

25:55.150 --> 25:58.881
PLEASE, I HAVE TRY.
A WOMAN'S LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.686
LOOK, YOU AND ME, WE DEAL
WITH BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE

26:02.720 --> 26:06.850
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO.
BUT WHAT WE REALLY DO
IS SAVE LIVES.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.029
HELP ME SAVE HER LIFE.

26:18.970 --> 26:20.835
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, JAKE?

26:20.880 --> 26:24.179
WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?

26:24.210 --> 26:26.906
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

26:26.950 --> 26:28.269
ABOUT WHAT?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.641
THE LETTER I GOT
WHEN THE CONTRACT ENDED.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.215
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THOSE LETTERS.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.319
THAT'S PEAKSTONE.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.180
YOU ARE PEAKSTONE.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.688
THAT IS NOT WHAT I DO.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.652
OTHER PEOPLE
AT THE COMPANY DO THAT,

26:40.700 --> 26:41.928
PEOPLE HIGHER UP
THAN ME.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.929
IT BREAKS EVERYTHING
DOWN BY MISSION.

26:44.970 --> 26:49.066
OUR LAST MISSION,
THAT ONE WAS BIG.

26:49.100 --> 26:52.968
372.

26:54.340 --> 26:57.036
THE INSURGENT
TRAINING CAMP?

26:57.080 --> 27:00.072
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR SERVICE.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.338
DON'T YOU KNOW?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.915
KNOW WHAT, JAKE?

27:06.950 --> 27:09.054
I TOLD YOU, AFTER I GET
A TEAM UP AND RUNNING,

27:09.090 --> 27:12.389
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE MISSIONS.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.834
I WISH I DIDN'T KNOW.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.206
THANK YOU.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.434
I DON'T OI-TEN
HAVE THE PLEASURE

27:29.480 --> 27:31.072
OF HOSTING DOMESTIC
LAW ENFORCEMENT,

27:31.110 --> 27:33.908
GIVEN THAT OUR BAILIWICK
IS NATIONAL SECURITY.

27:33.950 --> 27:36.942
I ONLY NEED ONE THING.
THE NAME OF THE DRONE PILOT

27:36.980 --> 27:40.438
ON THE TEAM THAT
TORI HOFFSTADT
PUT TOGETHER IN 2016.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.357
THAT INFORMATION
IS CONFIDENTIAL.

27:43.390 --> 27:46.154
I UNDERSTAND YOU ADMINISTER
PSYCH EVALUATIONS

27:46.190 --> 27:47.350
TO YOUR RECRUITS.

27:47.390 --> 27:48.357
THAT'S TRUE.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.799
THE RECRUIT I'M ASKING ABOUT

27:49.830 --> 27:51.297
WOULD HAVE TESTED
AS IMMATURE AND UNSTABLE,

27:51.330 --> 27:53.127
WITH AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.899
WE WOULDN'T EMPLOY
SUCH A PERSON.

27:54.940 --> 27:58.398
BUT IF YOU DID, THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU LIABLE FOR HIS ACTIONS.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.135
LET ME BE CLEAR.

28:00.170 --> 28:03.742
WE DO NOT EMPLOY

38:41.450 --> 38:43.873
YEAH. SHE GOT 5 YEARS
ON A PLEA

38:43.920 --> 38:45.512
IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER TESTIMONY.

38:45.550 --> 38:48.451
AND THE GOVERNMENT
CUT ALL CONTRACTS
WITH PEAKSTONE.

38:48.490 --> 38:51.550
ALL IN A DAY'S WORK.
FEELS GOOD.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.559
OH, AND I GOT YOUR
REPORT ON SCRATCH.
THANK YOU.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.420
OH, YEAH. IT'S NO PROBLEM.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.428
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO STAY LATE
TO FINISH IT, THOUGH.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.597
I DIDN'T--
DIDN'T TAKE LONG.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.394
I SEE YOU'RE STILL
DIGGING YOUR WAY OUT

39:03.440 --> 39:04.634
OF THIS MOUNTAIN
OF PAPERS.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.604
IT SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO METASTASIZE

39:06.640 --> 39:08.130
OVER THE 6 WEEKS
WE WERE OFF.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.479
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
LATE NIGHTS HAPPEN.

39:13.410 --> 39:15.514
NO WAY.
YOU BROUGHT DINNER?

39:15.550 --> 39:18.519
OHH! WOW,
THAT IS SO PERFECT.

39:18.550 --> 39:19.983
I FIGURED YOU'D BE
HUNGRY, YOU KNOW?

39:20.020 --> 39:21.112
THAI OK?

39:21.150 --> 39:23.516
OH, TOTALLY OK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.925
YOU GOTTA STAY
AND HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.521
UNLESS--NO, IT'S LATE
AND YOU GOTTA GO. ROXY.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.563
NO, ACTUALLY, ROXY 'S
STILL WITH MY PET SITTER

39:31.600 --> 39:33.124
AND IT'S TOO LATE
TO PICK HER UP NOW.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.637
I'LL SWING BY
IN THE MORNING.

39:34.670 --> 39:37.434
GOOD. [CHUCKLES]

39:37.470 --> 39:39.938
EATING ALONE IN
THE OFFICE IS THE WORST.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.130
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.503
AND WHY IT IS I ALWAYS
COME HOME TO AN EMPTY
REFRIGERATOR?

39:44.550 --> 39:45.539
YEAH.
