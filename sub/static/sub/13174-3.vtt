WEBVTT

00:04.174 --> 00:06.408
Boom. Found one.

00:10.582 --> 00:12.816
You're welcome...

00:12.841 --> 00:15.209
"Kurt... Turdhole?"

00:15.360 --> 00:16.652
- What?
- Turdhole.

00:16.677 --> 00:17.963
- Dude's name is Turdhole.
- No.

00:17.988 --> 00:20.398
Yeah, right.

00:20.423 --> 00:21.889
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:21.914 --> 00:24.098
Maybe it's "Turd-olee?"

00:24.123 --> 00:25.474
- I don't...
- Either way, he's dead.

00:25.499 --> 00:27.301
I would remember meeting a Turd-olee.

00:27.326 --> 00:29.626
Okay, we good then? Can we go back now?

00:29.651 --> 00:31.681
I mean, dude, there's got
to be more luggage out here.

00:31.706 --> 00:33.452
There could be food, medicine.

00:33.477 --> 00:35.277
Condoms.

00:35.976 --> 00:37.613
I didn't even think about that.

00:37.637 --> 00:38.527
- Yeah.
- Hah!

00:38.552 --> 00:40.328
Let me tell you, pal, in a month,

00:40.353 --> 00:42.134
those things are gonna be rubber gold.

00:42.159 --> 00:44.542
Nobody wants a bunch of
little island bastards

00:44.567 --> 00:47.048
running around with their
umbilical cords still attached.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.173
- Or whatever...
- Right there. What is that?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.114
Dude.

00:56.421 --> 01:00.178
There's no way this bad
boy just landed here.

01:00.466 --> 01:02.676
What are you saying
somebody hid this here?

01:02.803 --> 01:04.280
Man, look at this lock.

01:04.305 --> 01:06.162
Some kind of future lock.

01:06.187 --> 01:08.489
I mean, it's obvious
that whoever hid this

01:08.514 --> 01:10.026
did not want us to open it.

01:10.051 --> 01:13.106
What do you think's inside?

01:13.664 --> 01:15.042
I don't know.

01:15.067 --> 01:16.612
But it looks like we got ourselves

01:16.637 --> 01:20.340
an island... mystery.

01:25.245 --> 01:26.448
- Whoo!
- I got chills.

01:26.473 --> 01:27.984
Oh, I got goose flesh.

01:28.009 --> 01:29.072
When you said, "island mystery,"

01:29.097 --> 01:29.869
- I was like, Oh.
- Yeah.

01:29.894 --> 01:31.337
And the fact that it's a future lock.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.266
- I mean, I don't even...
- So cool.

01:33.291 --> 01:36.262
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:38.055 --> 01:40.065
Well, this is just
stupid. This is stupid.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.697
You're a stupid lock.

01:42.418 --> 01:43.521
Damn it.

01:44.189 --> 01:45.825
Tag's been busted off.

01:45.849 --> 01:47.979
- We got to get this open.
- I think we should just leave it alone.

01:48.004 --> 01:50.455
- You know, it's locked for a reason.
- Are you insane?

01:50.480 --> 01:53.498
Owen, when you go into a
store, what's locked up?

01:53.523 --> 01:55.456
All the good shit.

01:55.481 --> 01:57.982
Guns, booze, the nice deodorant.

01:58.007 --> 01:59.707
For all we know, it could be all three.

01:59.732 --> 02:02.099
Yeah, or it could be, like,
some drug lord's blood money.

02:02.124 --> 02:03.403
Or cocaine.

02:03.428 --> 02:04.423
Exactly.

02:12.359 --> 02:13.653
Here we go.

02:13.678 --> 02:15.070
Rich housewife handbag.

02:15.095 --> 02:16.942
- Ooh.
- Yep. Which means...

02:17.286 --> 02:19.679
Boom! Painkillers in a Ziploc.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.410
- Shah!
- Always.

02:22.197 --> 02:23.958
What is Pack doing?

02:23.983 --> 02:27.325
Oh, he said he wanted to feel
the warm glow of a screen.

02:27.889 --> 02:30.521
I don't know, I feel
like this is our chance

02:30.554 --> 02:33.384
- to unplug from that stuff, you know?
- Technology.

02:33.409 --> 02:34.875
Like, when is the last time

02:34.900 --> 02:37.066
you really connected with someone

02:37.091 --> 02:38.293
- on a deeper level?
- Found something!

02:38.318 --> 02:40.184
Oh, shut up, what is it?!

02:40.209 --> 02:41.935
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.344
Thank you, Toshiba.

02:43.604 --> 02:45.287
It's a DVD player.

02:45.312 --> 02:46.676
It's got two hours of battery left,

02:46.701 --> 02:48.082
just enough time to watch a movie.

02:48.107 --> 02:49.794
What's inside?

02:49.818 --> 02:51.753
Well, it looks like we are watching...

02:54.488 --> 02:55.989
It's empty.

02:56.119 --> 02:57.190
Oh.

02:57.215 --> 02:59.448
Man.

02:59.473 --> 03:01.643
What kind of monster travels
with an empty DVD player?

03:01.668 --> 03:04.188
- Well, so much for that.
- No. No.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.974
I need a break from this island.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.455
I need two hours

03:08.480 --> 03:10.951
where I don't think
about food, or water,

03:10.975 --> 03:14.437
or the fact that we saw the most
handsome man in the world possibly,

03:14.463 --> 03:16.759
get smushed to death by an airplane.

03:16.784 --> 03:18.004
Yeah.

03:18.029 --> 03:20.822
Emma, aren't you tired of Creepy Pete

03:20.847 --> 03:23.966
staring at you every time you bathe?

03:24.517 --> 03:27.470
- He's always watching.
- Never stops.

03:28.237 --> 03:29.723
And, Florence, aren't you tired of

03:29.748 --> 03:31.922
wiping your butthole with a palm frond?

03:32.113 --> 03:33.969
It feels like it's on fire.

03:33.994 --> 03:35.362
Exactly.

03:35.387 --> 03:37.570
This is why we need a break.

03:37.595 --> 03:42.293
And that break is some
dumb, mindless movie.

03:42.862 --> 03:45.338
All we have to do is find it.

03:45.802 --> 03:48.099
- We'll take the bags.
- You take the wreckage on the beach.

03:48.124 --> 03:49.711
Yes, there's the plan.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.187
It's movie night. Hell, yeah.

03:53.131 --> 03:54.301
- Whoo.
- Ahh!

03:55.668 --> 03:57.573
Geez! Man.

03:57.598 --> 03:59.037
Sorry, Turdhole.

03:59.498 --> 04:02.371
- Whoo!
- Opened that one, though.

04:02.396 --> 04:03.370
You're just smashing it.

04:03.395 --> 04:04.902
No one can open this,
no one could open this.

04:07.650 --> 04:08.298
Oh.

04:08.323 --> 04:09.474
Yeah.

04:09.635 --> 04:11.562
Sick son of a bitch.

04:11.587 --> 04:12.920
I'm going to get you open.

04:15.173 --> 04:16.141
At least hit the lock.

04:21.298 --> 04:22.339
Brother. Don't spit on it.

04:22.364 --> 04:23.280
I don't care, I hate it.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.917
Aah!

04:24.942 --> 04:26.299
Aah!

04:28.132 --> 04:31.517
Aah!

04:34.273 --> 04:35.914
I have an idea.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.755
DVDs, DVDs, DVDs.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.011
God. What's wrong with these people?

04:40.036 --> 04:41.369
- Glitter...
- Lotion.

04:41.394 --> 04:42.760
- Dumb bangle...
- Lotion.

04:42.785 --> 04:44.651
- Loneliest man on the planet.
- Ooh!

04:44.676 --> 04:46.481
- Toothbrushes, no case, disgusting.
- Loofah?

04:46.506 --> 04:48.366
This isn't even wet.

04:48.391 --> 04:50.651
No one has any DVDs anymore?

04:50.676 --> 04:53.003
Everyone's just streaming everything?

04:53.028 --> 04:55.532
Good for you, Netflix, you won.

04:55.749 --> 04:57.710
Ahh! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh,
my God. Look, look, look, look.

04:57.735 --> 04:58.662
What? What? What?

04:58.687 --> 05:00.758
Oh, my God.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.544
- Is that a stupid-looking DVD case?
- Yeah.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.870
No mix CDs, no mix CDs, no mix CDs.

05:04.895 --> 05:06.632
What is it?

05:06.888 --> 05:08.487
Huh?

05:08.537 --> 05:10.897
"Dumb and Dumber To."

05:10.922 --> 05:13.524
Yes! Yes!

05:14.298 --> 05:15.701
This is exactly what we
need. Are you kidding me?

05:15.726 --> 05:17.713
Dumb, loud, stupid fun... Dumb.

05:17.738 --> 05:19.526
And it's gonna distract us from the fact

05:19.550 --> 05:22.312
that we are all slowly
dying on this hell hole.

05:22.338 --> 05:25.570
Uh, wait, my friend.
There's another option.

05:25.594 --> 05:27.169
- What?
- The day is not done.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.298
- Oh, my God.
- It is...

05:31.603 --> 05:32.669
What is it?

05:32.694 --> 05:33.762
What is it?

05:33.948 --> 05:35.409
"Selma."

05:36.550 --> 05:40.545
"Selma," the Martin Luther King movie?

05:42.146 --> 05:44.738
- I always meant to see that, I just...
- Yeah, I know, me, too.

05:44.763 --> 05:47.573
- It's supposed to be so moving.
- Very powerful.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.662
Yeah.

05:48.687 --> 05:50.728
Such an important story.

05:50.753 --> 05:51.972
Mm-hmm.

05:52.623 --> 05:57.881
I mean, if this is the
last movie we ever watch,

05:57.906 --> 05:59.502
we need to make the right choice.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.703
Right. Yeah. So, yeah.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.221
Obviously, we should watch...

06:13.197 --> 06:15.281
- "Selma."
- "Selma."

06:15.531 --> 06:18.540
Yes. Movie night will be "Selma."

06:18.986 --> 06:20.085
Good.

06:20.197 --> 06:21.563
Great.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.048
So you want me to shoot the lock?

06:24.073 --> 06:25.706
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:25.917 --> 06:27.421
Do we know whose case it is?

06:27.446 --> 06:29.784
- No, the tag's busted off.
- I don't know, guys.

06:29.809 --> 06:31.675
Kind of seems like a waste of bullets.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.085
Are you serious? That's
real rich coming from you.

06:34.110 --> 06:35.502
What is that supposed to mean?

06:40.002 --> 06:42.441
Well, we ate pretty
damn well that night,

06:42.466 --> 06:43.475
didn't we, guys?

06:43.500 --> 06:46.156
Roger got lead poisoning.
Just give me the gun.

06:46.181 --> 06:49.296
Fine. But good luck
shooting off that lock.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.419
Child's play.

06:57.444 --> 06:58.970
This is very exciting.

07:04.555 --> 07:08.966
Mother of God.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.593
I mean, what kind of freak

07:17.618 --> 07:20.101
packs an entire bag full of sex toys?

07:20.126 --> 07:22.276
- This is F'd up.
- Yeah, so F'd.

07:22.301 --> 07:23.288
Yeah, for some reason,

07:23.313 --> 07:25.531
I thought there'd be stuff
in here to help us get home,

07:25.556 --> 07:27.295
not a sex swing.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.990
We need to find out who this pervert is.

07:29.015 --> 07:29.880
What? Why?

07:29.905 --> 07:30.960
Because, Danny,

07:30.985 --> 07:34.479
you're not packing "The Jackhammer,"

07:34.504 --> 07:36.518
unless you mean business.

07:36.543 --> 07:39.407
This guy could be a
full-on sexual deviant.

07:39.432 --> 07:40.934
I mean, think about it.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.039
We don't know anything about
who we're trapped here with.

07:43.064 --> 07:44.495
You know what? You're right.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.848
- We don't.
- Thank you.

07:45.872 --> 07:47.327
Now let's go find this freak

07:47.352 --> 07:50.381
before he finds us sleeping
with our mouths open,

07:50.406 --> 07:51.708
or our butts exposed,

07:51.733 --> 07:53.729
and he can plug 'em with
all sorts of things.

07:53.754 --> 07:54.815
No, no, I'm just saying, like,

07:54.840 --> 07:56.856
we really don't know anything
about who we're here with.

07:56.881 --> 07:57.975
There could be somebody here

07:58.000 --> 08:00.071
that knows how to build a raft, right?

08:00.096 --> 08:01.375
There could be an architect here

08:01.400 --> 08:04.655
that could design us a... blueprint.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.711
I don't know. The point is, we should
be figuring out everybody's skills

08:07.735 --> 08:08.743
so we can get home.

08:08.769 --> 08:10.615
What do we do, like a census?

08:10.640 --> 08:12.319
That's a good idea. Yes.

08:12.344 --> 08:13.942
- Census.
- Yeah.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.612
- That could work.
- Yeah.

08:15.637 --> 08:17.179
We ask a few leading questions,

08:17.204 --> 08:18.179
dig around a little,

08:18.204 --> 08:19.634
and then when we find the pervert,

08:19.659 --> 08:21.330
we grab him,

08:21.356 --> 08:23.370
Which they'll probably love.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.778
Todd, we're not trying to
find the pervert, okay?

08:25.803 --> 08:27.539
And you are definitely
not part of the census.

08:27.563 --> 08:28.939
Oh, yes, I am.

08:28.964 --> 08:31.290
It doesn't matter who owns these, man.

08:31.701 --> 08:32.953
All right, fine.

08:33.265 --> 08:34.932
If I'm not part of the census,

08:34.957 --> 08:36.881
I guess I'll just tell
everyone they're yours.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.145
What?

08:38.171 --> 08:41.067
I mean, it doesn't matter, right?

08:41.667 --> 08:42.754
What would you...?

08:42.779 --> 08:44.546
What? That makes zero sense.

08:44.571 --> 08:46.899
See? See? You think it's weird.

08:46.924 --> 08:48.091
It's not not weird, dude.

08:48.116 --> 08:49.972
It's very weird. I'm just... it's not...

08:49.997 --> 08:51.861
Fine, be on the census, be on it.

08:51.886 --> 08:52.975
I don't care, okay?

08:53.005 --> 08:54.670
But it's about getting
us off the island.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.669
There's got to be another one.

08:56.694 --> 08:57.772
Are you sure you checked it?

08:57.797 --> 08:59.237
No luck on my end.

08:59.261 --> 09:01.756
Please tell me you guys found a movie?

09:02.444 --> 09:04.911
- We did.
- Ahh. You did?

09:04.936 --> 09:06.292
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

09:06.317 --> 09:07.939
You, island.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.012
What are we watching?

09:09.037 --> 09:10.796
Well, we found "Dumb and Dumber To."

09:10.821 --> 09:11.930
Absolutely. Love it.

09:11.956 --> 09:14.139
Carrey and Daniels back
together cashing checks.

09:14.163 --> 09:16.294
The tongue getting stuck, you
remember that, on the pole?

09:16.319 --> 09:17.335
- Mm-hmm.
- Ahh!

09:17.360 --> 09:18.481
- In the first one.
- Ahh!

09:18.506 --> 09:20.273
- That was in the first one.
- Aah!

09:20.298 --> 09:22.378
Maybe they'll bring that back, you know?

09:22.403 --> 09:25.338
And... also "Selma."

09:27.706 --> 09:29.323
"Selma"?

09:31.279 --> 09:33.433
The critically-acclaimed
civil rights story?

09:33.836 --> 09:35.546
"Selma."

09:35.796 --> 09:37.773
- Always meant to see that.
- Of course.

09:37.798 --> 09:39.823
- Us, too. We missed it.
- Yeah.

09:40.099 --> 09:42.132
And we're sure there's
only enough charge

09:42.157 --> 09:43.168
for one movie?

09:43.193 --> 09:45.094
- Just for one.
- Just one.

09:49.136 --> 09:51.236
- "Selma."
- Uh-huh.

09:51.271 --> 09:53.138
- It's great.
- Yep.

09:53.741 --> 09:55.564
Steve, this is something of a census.

09:55.589 --> 09:57.255
It's just to get an idea

09:57.280 --> 09:59.480
of what everyone's skills
are here on the island.

09:59.505 --> 10:02.066
Ask away. I love a good query.

10:02.272 --> 10:03.702
You're a plumber?

10:03.735 --> 10:05.819
Okay. Wow. That's fantastic.

10:05.844 --> 10:07.711
So then maybe you can help with what,

10:07.746 --> 10:09.923
like a water collection system, or...?

10:09.948 --> 10:10.901
A plumber, huh?

10:10.926 --> 10:13.011
Bet you know a lot about laying pipe?

10:13.414 --> 10:14.883
Am I right?

10:14.908 --> 10:16.941
- Pack, you're a sports agent, right?
- Yeah.

10:16.966 --> 10:18.309
- Okay.
- Very successful.

10:18.334 --> 10:20.186
Do you have any practical skills?

10:20.211 --> 10:22.575
Is leasing a brand-new Audi every year

10:22.600 --> 10:23.599
a practical skill?

10:25.534 --> 10:26.846
No.

10:26.871 --> 10:28.078
Okay.

10:28.103 --> 10:30.614
- Emma, you're obviously a foot doctor.
- Podiatrist.

10:30.639 --> 10:32.640
Yes, you wouldn't call a gynecologist

10:32.665 --> 10:35.457
- a pussy doctor, would you?
- Would you?

10:36.259 --> 10:37.941
No.

10:37.966 --> 10:39.580
And why were you going to Thailand?

10:39.605 --> 10:42.876
- Business or pleasure?
- Pleasure. Yep.

10:42.901 --> 10:44.785
Just wanted to get away for a bit.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.921
Looking to get a little
loose, a little wild?

10:47.946 --> 10:50.465
Yeah. Little bit.

10:50.490 --> 10:51.786
Hmm.

10:52.617 --> 10:55.713
Just running it through the ground?

10:56.087 --> 10:57.748
Filling it up, hmm?

10:57.773 --> 10:58.941
Not going to answer?

10:58.966 --> 11:00.333
Put him at the top of the list.

11:00.358 --> 11:02.317
- Of what?
- The census.

11:02.342 --> 11:05.269
So why were you guys going to Thailand?

11:05.294 --> 11:06.828
I thought it was a chance to reconnect

11:06.853 --> 11:08.502
before she started at a hospital.

11:08.527 --> 11:10.393
Reconnect, huh?

11:10.947 --> 11:12.681
Oh. Okay. We're good here.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.596
- Okay, buddy.
- Let's go.

11:14.873 --> 11:16.584
Jerk.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.189
- Hit a nerve.
- You're an idiot.

11:19.725 --> 11:21.294
- We get it.
- Did you get it?

11:21.319 --> 11:22.252
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

11:22.277 --> 11:23.278
- That's just...
- I got it.

11:23.866 --> 11:25.884
Sun's going down.

11:26.221 --> 11:29.660
Almost time for... "Selma."

11:29.685 --> 11:32.133
Yay.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.438
Uh, wait.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.830
What if we asked Diane from Toledo

11:40.854 --> 11:42.165
what she thought?

11:42.190 --> 11:43.718
Right?

11:43.743 --> 11:45.758
I mean, if she didn't want to watch,

11:45.790 --> 11:46.826
you know, one of the movies...

11:46.851 --> 11:47.922
- Either one.
- Right?

11:47.947 --> 11:49.836
I mean, I guess it would be fine,

11:49.861 --> 11:52.511
'cause, you know, she's a...

11:52.722 --> 11:55.011
- Uh...
- She's a...

11:55.731 --> 11:56.813
Film buff?

11:56.838 --> 11:58.404
- A film buff? Yes!
- Yes!

11:58.429 --> 11:59.923
A strong, powerful film buff.

11:59.948 --> 12:02.049
- Lover of the arts.
- Yes, she is.

12:02.074 --> 12:03.382
"Selma."

12:03.407 --> 12:05.286
Well, obviously,

12:05.311 --> 12:07.990
that is a very important movie.

12:08.015 --> 12:09.078
- Yes.
- Necessary.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.436
Vital to our history.

12:15.634 --> 12:19.380
Yes, we'd be remiss if
we didn't watch "Selma."

12:19.794 --> 12:20.902
Good.

12:20.927 --> 12:22.590
- Yep.
- Great.

12:27.193 --> 12:30.543
Just curious... What
was the other movie?

12:30.568 --> 12:32.591
- "Dumb and Dumber To."
- Jim Carrey?

12:32.616 --> 12:33.448
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:33.473 --> 12:35.366
Oh, I love him.

12:35.391 --> 12:37.197
- He is so funny.
- He's a physical comedian.

12:37.222 --> 12:38.724
You can watch him on mute.

12:38.749 --> 12:40.646
- Oh, my God,
- I love Jim Carrey.

12:40.671 --> 12:42.026
He's so watchable.

12:42.051 --> 12:43.915
Yeah. Um...

12:45.625 --> 12:47.390
I'll see y'all at "Selma."

12:49.500 --> 12:51.265
Yes, you will.

12:56.348 --> 12:59.527
Three baristas, one foot doctor,

12:59.552 --> 13:02.715
two lifestyle bloggers, and
the founder of "Deez Nutz,"

13:02.740 --> 13:04.785
which is an app that lets you see

13:04.810 --> 13:07.539
what you would look like
with other people's pubes.

13:07.564 --> 13:08.620
This island is useless.

13:08.645 --> 13:10.291
We still don't know
who the sex freak is.

13:10.316 --> 13:11.707
How am I supposed to sleep at night?

13:11.732 --> 13:12.698
Huh?

13:12.723 --> 13:14.728
I'm taking these.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.220
So it's not gonna bother you

13:16.246 --> 13:17.779
that we don't know who the sex freak is?

13:17.804 --> 13:18.779
Hmm.

13:18.804 --> 13:20.907
I think this is just
gonna have to remain

13:20.932 --> 13:24.099
- an island mystery.
- I hate this island!

13:24.594 --> 13:26.660
Oh. Hi, guys.

13:26.685 --> 13:28.940
I... was going through the stuff,

13:28.965 --> 13:30.938
and, uh, I think this is yours.

13:30.963 --> 13:32.400
Oh, my God, my planner.

13:32.426 --> 13:34.453
And no luck finding your bag, Danny,

13:34.478 --> 13:36.139
but we did find this tag.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.105
Damn it. Tag's been busted off.

13:44.832 --> 13:47.664
So, uh, I guess I'll
see you guys at "Selma."

13:47.689 --> 13:48.962
Should be, uh...

13:48.987 --> 13:51.000
I don't know.

13:52.488 --> 13:54.336
The suitcase is yours?

13:54.575 --> 13:57.432
I can explain.

14:00.378 --> 14:02.198
It's time.

14:03.559 --> 14:05.709
It's time to watch "Selma."

14:07.000 --> 14:13.074

14:31.593 --> 14:34.100
About a year ago, I
got into a relationship

14:34.125 --> 14:36.907
with a woman named Becca from Vietnam.

14:36.932 --> 14:39.075
A Vietnamese woman named Rebecca?

14:39.100 --> 14:40.102
Okay.

14:40.127 --> 14:41.306
We were going to meet in Thailand,

14:41.331 --> 14:42.964
and that's why I was super-nervous,

14:42.989 --> 14:44.575
'cause we had only e-mailed and chatted.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.903
We had never met in person before.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.771
You never FaceTimed or Skyped, or...?

14:47.796 --> 14:49.378
No, she always had a bad connection.

14:49.403 --> 14:52.319
You ever think that maybe
you were getting catfished?

14:52.344 --> 14:54.275
- Yeah. Of course.
- Okay.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.233
But her words were so
sweet and funny and...

14:57.258 --> 15:00.217
I don't know, I took a chance, you know?

15:00.242 --> 15:01.626
Yeah, there was also a chance

15:01.651 --> 15:03.751
that she was another weird
guy with mutton chops.

15:03.776 --> 15:05.137
- Another.
- Yeah.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.955
But there's a chance she was real.

15:08.415 --> 15:11.775
You know, there's a chance that she was
really waiting for me at the airport.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.441
- I'm sorry if I took a chance on love.
- No, no, oh, my God.

15:15.565 --> 15:17.507
I think it's really sweet, honestly.

15:17.532 --> 15:19.563
I just think that the weirdness comes

15:19.588 --> 15:22.682
when she asks you to fill
a briefcase with dildos.

15:22.707 --> 15:24.025
She said when I fly over,

15:24.050 --> 15:26.318
I should make sure to bring enough dong.

15:27.977 --> 15:29.535
Danny, did you ever consider

15:29.560 --> 15:31.780
that maybe she asked you to bring dong,

15:31.805 --> 15:34.215
because that's the currency of Vietnam?

15:34.240 --> 15:36.740
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it is.

15:36.765 --> 15:38.654
- Dong?
- Yeah.

15:38.679 --> 15:41.190
D-o-n-g? That's not true.

15:41.215 --> 15:43.020
Oh, I'm 1,000% sure that it is.

15:43.044 --> 15:46.576
So if I go to a store, and
I want a pack of smokes,

15:46.601 --> 15:47.744
I say, "Here's 5 dong"?

15:47.769 --> 15:49.291
I don't know the exchange rate, but...

15:49.316 --> 15:51.815
So if something's expensive,
it's too much dong?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.427
- Yeah.
- She was talking about money.

15:56.265 --> 15:57.954
Oh, shit.

15:57.979 --> 15:59.135
I think it's really sweet

15:59.160 --> 16:00.626
that you followed through, honestly.

16:00.651 --> 16:02.111
Come on. I'm not a sex freak, man.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.899
I swear, this was just a huge mistake.

16:03.924 --> 16:05.144
Dude, I won't say anything.

16:05.169 --> 16:06.796
If you want, I'll just...
I'll keep it buried.

16:06.821 --> 16:08.524
I haven't told anyone you're not a cop.

16:08.549 --> 16:10.203
- Thanks, Owen.
- Yeah.

16:10.228 --> 16:11.902
I know that, you know, if
the tables were turned...

16:11.927 --> 16:12.647
Wait.

16:14.718 --> 16:18.914
Someone here is a freak and a liar,

16:18.939 --> 16:20.623
and we're not watching this movie

16:20.648 --> 16:22.359
until I find this perv.

16:23.635 --> 16:25.958
Someone packed an arsenal big enough

16:25.983 --> 16:27.871
to bang this entire island

16:27.896 --> 16:30.063
and we have a right to know who.

16:30.088 --> 16:33.922
We also have a right to
know how this one works.

16:33.947 --> 16:35.668
- What is that?
- Oh, that's the front.

16:35.694 --> 16:36.968
Todd, why don't we just let this go?

16:36.993 --> 16:38.912
We don't really have to
get to the bottom of this.

16:38.937 --> 16:41.711
Todd, is this what all your
weird questions were about?

16:41.736 --> 16:44.244
Yeah, and I'm looking right at you two.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.061
Excuse me?

16:45.086 --> 16:47.861
All that talk about
reconnecting in Thailand,

16:47.887 --> 16:49.390
- is that what this so for?
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:49.415 --> 16:51.345
Sexually, I'm an open book,

16:51.370 --> 16:53.181
and if those were mine, I
would straight-up own it.

16:53.205 --> 16:54.707
Yeah, it's probably Steve's.

16:54.732 --> 16:55.328
Me?

16:55.353 --> 16:56.792
Yeah, man, you're divorced,

16:56.817 --> 16:58.345
you're traveling to
Thailand by yourself.

16:58.370 --> 17:00.593
That has like 10-day
tour written all over it.

17:00.618 --> 17:01.595
10 days?

17:01.620 --> 17:02.880
Well, I'm flattered,

17:02.905 --> 17:04.500
but I've never seen any
of those things before.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.881
How do we know they're not yours?

17:05.906 --> 17:08.538
Hmm? Why were you and
Jess going to Thailand?

17:08.564 --> 17:10.137
Okay, all right, for your information,

17:10.162 --> 17:12.945
Todd was gonna surprise me
with something very special.

17:13.038 --> 17:15.007
- Tell him, babe.
- Babe, it was a surprise.

17:15.031 --> 17:18.068
Babe, it could still be
a surprise, right here.

17:18.093 --> 17:19.762
Fine. God.

17:20.268 --> 17:23.051
When we got to Thailand,
I was gonna give you...

17:25.028 --> 17:30.563
"The Hangover 2," premium
experience movie tour.

17:30.944 --> 17:32.404
What?

17:32.429 --> 17:34.364
- What? What is that?
- Trip of a lifetime.

17:34.389 --> 17:36.492
They take you to all the
"Hangover 2" locations,

17:36.517 --> 17:38.764
you have brunch with the monkey.

17:38.789 --> 17:40.852
And Justin Bartha picks
you up at the airport.

17:40.877 --> 17:42.604
How much did you even spend on that?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.220
I don't know, like three months' salary.

17:44.245 --> 17:44.779
Wow.

17:44.804 --> 17:46.444
Anyway, surprise.

17:46.469 --> 17:48.748
There. I came clean.

17:48.773 --> 17:51.061
Now somebody come clean about all this.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.331
We could just let this go.

17:52.356 --> 17:53.094
They're mine.

17:54.936 --> 17:56.102
That's gross.

18:01.176 --> 18:04.736
- What?
- That's my case and those are my...

18:04.768 --> 18:05.977
things.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.236
What? Dude, no way.

18:09.261 --> 18:11.336
Ew.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.032
Seriously?

18:13.057 --> 18:15.608
Ew!

18:15.633 --> 18:16.944
Yeah.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.405
Yeah, I'm the sex freak.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.801
Ah, you don't have to say it twice!

18:25.759 --> 18:27.723
I was a pageant prince.

18:27.748 --> 18:29.233
- What?
- Hmm?

18:29.258 --> 18:30.849
Yeah, when I was 9 years old,

18:30.874 --> 18:33.227
I was crowned Little Mr. Nevada.

18:33.315 --> 18:35.163
They are beauty pageants for boys?

18:35.188 --> 18:36.477
No, there's not.

18:36.502 --> 18:38.109
And I won.

18:38.134 --> 18:39.348
Wow. Geez.

18:39.373 --> 18:40.891
I'm just saying...

18:41.370 --> 18:46.307
don't we all have a sex
toy in our suitcase?

18:50.761 --> 18:52.292
I'm not a vegan anymore.

18:52.317 --> 18:55.064
I've been sneaking boar
every single night,

18:55.089 --> 18:57.627
and that shit is delish.

18:57.652 --> 18:58.751
Everybody!

18:58.924 --> 19:00.260
I'm a fraud.

19:00.285 --> 19:03.367
This amazing suit and
shirt, it's off the rack.

19:04.812 --> 19:06.852
I feel like a weight has
been lifted off of me.

19:06.877 --> 19:07.695
It feels good.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.118
I'm a liar.

19:09.546 --> 19:13.662
My last name isn't Smith, it's Turdhole.

19:14.669 --> 19:15.902
Kurt Turdhole.

19:15.927 --> 19:18.974
I tell people it's
"Turd-olee" but it's not.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.806
I killed a man outside Tallahassee.

19:20.831 --> 19:21.543
What?

19:21.568 --> 19:22.654
- Oh, no.
- What?

19:22.679 --> 19:24.562
I told myself it was him or me,

19:24.587 --> 19:25.568
but that's a lie.

19:25.594 --> 19:26.673
It was always him.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.343
Okay, let's... Let's shut this down.

19:30.368 --> 19:32.820
I'm not gonna bite my tongue anymore.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.926
I got to speak my mind.

19:34.951 --> 19:37.096
I don't want to watch "Selma."

19:38.126 --> 19:39.809
It's too long, and it's not fun,

19:39.834 --> 19:41.121
and we're all just watching it

19:41.146 --> 19:43.079
because we don't want to seem racist.

19:43.104 --> 19:44.228
That is not true.

19:44.253 --> 19:46.320
I'm ethnic so I'm not...

19:46.345 --> 19:47.844
No, no, no, no, no.

19:47.869 --> 19:49.603
She's right.

19:49.848 --> 19:52.481
I want to watch "Dumb and Dumber."

19:52.506 --> 19:55.272
I mean, if this is the last
movie I am ever going to see,

19:55.297 --> 19:58.073
I want to watch those two crazy
white boys, and I want to laugh...

19:58.098 --> 19:59.905
Ooh, forgive me, Dr.
King... But I want to laugh.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.713
Yeah, I want to laugh. I mean,
if we have forgiveness...

20:01.738 --> 20:03.480
I'm with Diane!

20:07.481 --> 20:09.668
Wait, so no one cares

20:09.694 --> 20:13.792
a freak over here had
this huge bang bag?

20:13.816 --> 20:15.311
No one?

20:15.336 --> 20:17.183
Hey, man, thanks.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.272
That meant a lot.

20:18.297 --> 20:21.711
Yeah. Yeah, hey, I took a chance.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.456
What?

20:24.036 --> 20:26.183
Because when we were
walking, you said...

20:26.208 --> 20:28.208
- Oh, just before the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- "I took a chance"

20:28.244 --> 20:29.803
- It was trying to do, like, a call...
- I lost that. I'm sorry.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.406
- It was a callback.
- No, it was good, it was good.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.398
- It was stupid.
- No, no, no, it was good. It was great.

20:33.423 --> 20:35.045
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was cool.

20:35.070 --> 20:37.371
- Okay, cool, all right.
- All right, let's join.

20:37.396 --> 20:38.506
Okay.

20:38.531 --> 20:39.494
Todd: Get in the back, freak.

20:39.519 --> 20:41.285
Florence: You're tall. Get in the back.

20:43.870 --> 20:46.661
Careful, no anal beads fall out.

20:46.686 --> 20:48.782
- Oh, should I hit "play"?
- Yeah.
