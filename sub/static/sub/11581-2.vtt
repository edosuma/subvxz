00:01.135 --> 00:03.304
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.337 --> 00:06.674
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.143
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.177 --> 00:10.811
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.844 --> 00:12.546
are members of an elite squad

00:12.580 --> 00:14.348
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.016
These are their stories.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.124
More blood.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.393
( radio chatter )

00:25.426 --> 00:27.595
Turn them down.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.100
Floor's clean this way.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.235
Elliot...
What have you got?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.104
Print on the wall.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.151
Psst! Psst....
something on the door.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.830
It's locked.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.866
BOY ( distant ):
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!

01:05.899 --> 01:09.370
( siren )

01:09.403 --> 01:11.572
Patrol got the call
at 9:50 A.M.,

01:11.605 --> 01:14.175
passerby saw a broken window,
open door, thought it might

01:14.208 --> 01:16.144
have been a break-in
till they heard shots fired.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.811
We found two dead kids
in the gym,

01:17.845 --> 01:19.880
naked except
for shoes and socks.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.881
Elliot's inside.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.582
Hey, they get
the shooter yet?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.117
Negative, your guy
just called

01:23.151 --> 01:24.618
for ESU and HNT.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.155
HNT. Bastard's got a hostage.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.123
Let the boy go and we can talk.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.424
We're not going to hurt you.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.166
I repeat, we're not going to
harm you, just let the kid go!

01:38.199 --> 01:39.600
( whispering ):
Any other exits?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.135
I don't know.
Where's HNT?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.603
On their way.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.505
My name is Elliot.
What's your name?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.409
Look, send out the kid,

01:48.442 --> 01:49.910
I'm going to step away
from the door...

01:49.943 --> 01:52.112
( gunshot )

02:08.562 --> 02:10.198
Got the kid.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.432
FIN:
Shooter's gone!

02:11.465 --> 02:13.534
Might have gone out this way.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.406
( moaning )

02:18.439 --> 02:20.174
Where are you hit?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.210
My head.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.183
Okay. All right.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.685
Everything's going to be fine.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.892
Stay with me.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.661
Gunshot wound
to the head.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.330
Kid is passed out.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.532
Manhattan SVU,
we got a teenage boy,

02:44.565 --> 02:45.699
gunshot to the head,
put a rush...

02:48.269 --> 02:52.373
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:52.406 --> 02:55.943
and NBC

03:35.783 --> 03:36.784
No luck?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.286
Lady saw a tall
white guy running,

03:38.319 --> 03:39.587
he' jumps into a car
a block away.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.588
Make, model?

03:40.621 --> 03:41.589
Black or blue or

03:41.622 --> 03:43.491
green, maybe. Any
word on the kid?

03:43.524 --> 03:45.459
Elliot called.
Kid is still

03:45.493 --> 03:46.994
unconscious, but the bullet
only winged him.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.698
Teacher lives close by, came in
when he heard the sirens.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.533
Says the boy's
name is Joe Blaine,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.436
ID'd the victims as
Luke Rhodes and Tyrell Dent.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.371
School basketball stars.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.540
Patrol's informing the families.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.874
Takes hazing
to a whole new level.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.643
What were the kids doing
here on a Saturday anyway?

04:02.676 --> 04:03.844
Patrol found
a basketball outside.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.978
Probably shooting hoops.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.914
Killer came up, broke a window,
and forced them inside.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.349
Captain...

04:08.382 --> 04:10.518
Hector Recincto,
school security.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.652
There's a gun missing.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.653
Where from?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.822
My lock-box.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.424
I confiscated it
from a student Friday.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.891
Patrol was going
to pick it up Monday.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.394
What's the student's name?

04:20.428 --> 04:21.462
Derek Fowler.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.732
He's in the same grade
as these boys.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.501
Police!
We have a search warrant!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.339
Hands where we
can see them!

04:31.372 --> 04:32.340
What'd I do?

04:32.373 --> 04:33.341
Name!

04:33.374 --> 04:35.042
Randy Fowler.
I'm clean,

04:35.075 --> 04:36.844
ask my P.O.
Shut up.
Where's Derek?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.347
In his room.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.350
Don't go smashing
down his door.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.453
What the hell?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.320
Where's the gun, Derek?
What gun?

04:46.354 --> 04:47.888
The one you brought
to school on Friday.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.558
School pigs took it off me.
Kicked my ass out.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.759
You stole my gun,
you little prick?

04:51.792 --> 04:52.893
I was going
to tell you, Dad.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.462
I didn't use it,
I was showing off.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.829
Where were you
this morning?
Shut up, Derek.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.897
You don't have to say anything.

04:56.930 --> 04:57.898
That's right, listen

04:57.931 --> 04:58.766
to your pops.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.469
You can spill your guts
at the precinct.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.970
The kid usually
lives with mom.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.539
He's been suspended twice
for bringing knives to school.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.408
Now he's graduated
to guns.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.676
School expelled him,
maybe he decided

05:08.709 --> 05:09.777
on a quick revenge.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.044
Or maybe one
of the dead boys

05:11.078 --> 05:13.514
saw the piece
and turned Derek in.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.682
I checked
dad's movements.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.883
He was drinking
his breakfast

05:15.916 --> 05:17.451
from 10:00 to 12:00 AM
at the local bar.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.719
That gives Derek
plenty of time

05:18.752 --> 05:20.688
to go out and do his thing.
( cell phone ringing )

05:20.721 --> 05:21.889
M.E. says that there's no hairs,

05:21.922 --> 05:23.957
no fluids on the victims,
so no DNA.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.526
No sexual assault?
Doesn't look like it.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.527
FIN:
Well, our perp gets

05:26.560 --> 05:27.528
his kicks out of killing.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.596
He could've made those kids

05:28.629 --> 05:29.597
strip just to humiliate them.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.499
That was Elliot.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.401
Joe Blaine is awake.
Get down there.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.435
Show him an array.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.437
See if he picks out
our little buddy in there.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.810
Joe, do you recognize
any of these faces?

05:44.945 --> 05:48.449
He went to my school.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.983
Did he hurt you?

05:51.519 --> 05:54.955
You can do this, honey.
You can help them.

05:54.988 --> 05:55.956
How'd you get inside?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.825
Who broke the window?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.528
He made me do it.
I cut my hand.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.929
And who is he?
Do you know him?

06:03.864 --> 06:04.898
He has a gun,

06:04.932 --> 06:06.967
he has a gun...

06:09.069 --> 06:11.439
oh boy, oh boy,

06:11.472 --> 06:13.140
he's shooting,

06:13.173 --> 06:15.509
bang, bang...

06:15.543 --> 06:16.610
It's okay.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.745
Tell them what you saw.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.812
I can't.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.147
BENSON:
Did you see his face?

06:20.180 --> 06:25.586
No, no, no...
I don't want to.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.491
You're a really
talented artist, Joe.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.193
I bet you could draw
his face.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.563
I don't remember.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.664
STABLER:
Think back.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.566
He dragged you
to the boiler room,

06:38.599 --> 06:40.167
he had a gun...

06:42.703 --> 06:44.137
I know you can do this, Joe.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.440
Just give us his face,
that's all we need, just give us

06:46.474 --> 06:48.442
his face.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.517
HECTOR:
Sure I know him.
George Waddell.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.685
He's the janitor here.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.489
What kind of guy is he?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.190
He's got a temper.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.725
Some kids messed
with him last week,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.494
kicked his bucket over.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.495
George went after them

07:07.528 --> 07:08.596
with a mop.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.830
And, uh, what kids were these?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.031
There was
a bunch of them,

07:11.064 --> 07:13.166
but you know who started it?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.168
The kids that got shot,
Luke and Tyrell.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.704
Call's gone out.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.639
Now you said you kept
the gun in a lock-box?

07:18.672 --> 07:22.175
Yeah, we confiscate a gun
it goes in here

07:22.209 --> 07:23.711
till the cops come pick it up.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.712
STABLER:
Who else has the key?

07:24.745 --> 07:25.713
Only me.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.481
BENSON:
And you keep it
with you at all times?

07:27.515 --> 07:29.717
Of course. I keep
a spare set hidden back here.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.184
Nobody ever
comes around this side.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.687
Except for the janitor.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.758
FIN:
We know you went
to the school today, George.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.059
On Saturday?
Why would I do that?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.662
'Cause you wanted a rematch
with those kids
that pissed you off.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.230
No, sir, they were just
having a little fun with me.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.231
MUNCH:
Sure you didn't want

07:44.264 --> 07:45.432
to teach them a lesson?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.635
Strip 'em naked? Embarrass them
like they embarrassed you?

07:47.668 --> 07:48.636
No way.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.237
You killed
these kids, George.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.872
Whoa! I didn't
kill nobody.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.507
Sure you did,
with the gun you lifted

07:53.541 --> 07:54.808
from the security office.
I didn't shoot

07:54.842 --> 07:55.876
nobody with that gun.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.611
Seem to know
a lot about it.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.513
I'm not saying anything else.
I wasn't at the school.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.681
Yeah, well,
this puts you there.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.082
Joey Blaine drew that,
after you tried

08:02.115 --> 08:03.283
to put a bullet
through his skull.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.653
I would never hurt Joey.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.654
You stole the gun,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.021
you killed Luke and Tyrell,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.523
you dragged Joey
into the boiler room,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.024
locked yourself in,
then you tried to kill Joey.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.225
Oh, yeah?

08:12.259 --> 08:15.563
So if I locked myself in,
how come I'm not still there?

08:15.596 --> 08:17.731
You went out
through the window.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.032
Nobody can get
out of that window.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.167
FIN:
I did.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.735
Look, man.
I got emphysema.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.670
Maybe you could wiggle

08:22.703 --> 08:25.072
your pretty little ass
out of there. Not me.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.545
STABLER:
Well, he could be
telling the truth.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.046
It would have taken
half-an-hour

08:33.080 --> 08:34.648
for that wheezer George
to get out that window.

08:34.682 --> 08:35.949
So how'd he get out?

08:35.983 --> 08:39.019
SIPER:
Detectives. We got
ourselves a puzzle.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.689
Fire a gun in here,
ricochet heaven.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.724
If we trace
the bullet backwards,

08:43.757 --> 08:45.025
it ended up at

08:45.058 --> 08:46.226
the base of the wall.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.227
Before that,

08:47.260 --> 08:50.130
it bounced off the furnace,

08:50.163 --> 08:53.333
after it first hit that pipe.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.202
The bullet impact mark
is a perfect circle,

08:55.235 --> 08:56.637
means the bullet was fired

08:56.670 --> 08:59.807
straight up,
which doesn't make sense.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.575
Unless Joe struggled
with the shooter

09:01.609 --> 09:03.811
and forced him
to fire straight up in the air.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.312
Could be the reason why
the bullet only grazed

09:05.345 --> 09:06.580
the side of Joe's head.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.648
Possible.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.982
How you doing on prints?

09:09.016 --> 09:10.684
We've got hundreds.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.819
At least the kid's
are easy,

09:11.852 --> 09:13.654
there's blood all over them.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.823
Sprayed amido-black
to bring them up.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.725
Did Joe leave his prints
on the inside door lock?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.927
Yep. Shooter must've
made him shut it.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.164
So what if the kid and the
shooter are the same person?

09:24.197 --> 09:26.333
Joe comes in here,
he runs to the window,

09:26.366 --> 09:30.337
it's too high, he can't get out,
he hears us on the outside,

09:30.370 --> 09:31.404
he put the gun to his own head,

09:31.438 --> 09:35.108
he shrinks from the shot,
bullet goes straight up.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.309
He's bleeding, he panics,

09:36.343 --> 09:39.747
so he looks for a place
to hide the gun...

09:46.186 --> 09:47.888
Where else?

09:56.196 --> 09:59.066
( knocking on door )

09:59.099 --> 10:00.734
Detectives, did you find the guy

10:00.768 --> 10:01.802
who did it?
Where's Joe?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.937
In his room.
Why?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.673
What's wrong?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.374
Tell me.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.709
Tell me!

10:08.742 --> 10:10.678
Joe, it's the police.
Open up.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.350
My God, what are you doing!?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.419
What are you
doing with guns?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.421
Please don't
hurt him!

10:21.454 --> 10:23.090
Please, wait!

10:26.827 --> 10:27.861
Where is he?

10:27.895 --> 10:30.030
I don't know.
He was just here.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.771
I guess that's one window
he could get out of.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.875
Elliot...

10:41.909 --> 10:43.877
school gym,
two bodies on the floor,

10:43.911 --> 10:47.748
shooter standing over them.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.820
He planned
the whole damn thing.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.293
It's just a drawing.
It doesn't mean he did it.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.695
BENSON:
Well, if he didn't do it,

11:01.729 --> 11:04.331
then why did he run away?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.498
He's terrified.

11:05.532 --> 11:08.736
He saw his friends killed,
someone tried to shoot him,

11:08.769 --> 11:11.805
and he's afraid the guy's going
to come back and get him.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.806
School gym,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.843
two dead bodies,
guy with a gun.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.210
Your kid did this.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.748
Nope. Drawing is
an outlet for Joey.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.215
He drew what he saw,
not what he did.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.216
What he saw?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.285
This is dated July 4th.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.221
Joe did this, Sandra.
This is what he did.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.090
You're wrong.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.759
He's a gentle kid.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.126
He's a...

11:33.160 --> 11:34.762
a really sweet kid.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.764
I know
he's been depressed recently,

11:36.797 --> 11:38.098
but he couldn't have done it.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.100
Sandra...

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
Joe could hurt himself.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.370
He could hurt somebody else.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.806
Now, you need to tell us
where he is.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.174
I already told you.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.342
We came home from
the hospital.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.944
He went into his room.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.345
I had no idea that
he'd gone, until

11:52.379 --> 11:54.782
you guys come
busting in.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.850
Does he have any friends
that he would go to?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.287
He has his art, okay?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.789
That's what matters.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.290
What about family?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.257
What about his dad?

12:04.291 --> 12:07.260
No. It's just Joe and me.

12:07.294 --> 12:11.464
His dad walked out
on us three years ago.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.804
So why would Joe
pick out Luke and Tyrell?

12:16.837 --> 12:18.205
HUANG:
Because they're athletes.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.439
They're the kings
of the school.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.208
Joe's a loner.
He's socially awkward.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.442
He's been teased and bullied.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.311
After years of humiliation,
he snaps.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.412
Like Eric Harris
at Columbine.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.815
Walks into the room,
shouts, "All jocks stand up,"

12:27.848 --> 12:29.783
and then he starts shooting.
( knocking )

12:29.817 --> 12:32.285
MUNCH:
This model citizen
has a confession to make.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.453
Spill it, George.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.822
I gave Joey the gun.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.989
Tell them why.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.290
He's always getting picked on.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.392
It was just to scare
the other kids.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.561
I had no idea
it was loaded, man.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.096
If I'd known,
I never would have...

12:43.130 --> 12:44.998
Yeah, right.
Thank you.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.433
We got the LUDS from Moms.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.335
Two hours after Joey
left the hospital,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.470
someone made a call
to MetroNorth line,

12:50.503 --> 12:53.040
passenger information.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.345
WOMAN:
Computer logged your boy's call
at 4:05 p.m.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.447
It also logged
the menu choices he made.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.049
Where's he heading?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.050
Let's see.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.018
He checked the schedule
for trains

13:05.052 --> 13:06.019
to Milford, Connecticut.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.355
The first he could have caught
was at 5:35 p.m.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.825
So my boys here checked
today's cameras from 4:30 on.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.863
Alfonso struck gold.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.198
FIN:
Look, kind of hard
to miss, isn't he?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.399
5:25 p.m.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.600
Psycho brat caught the 5:35.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.402
I'll call Connecticut
state troopers.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.471
Well, hang on. He's not leaving
the upper level.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.106
So?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.208
Out of town trains leave
from the lower level.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.210
So he's going downstairs.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.211
Not in that direction.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.445
He's headed for the subway.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.280
Staying in the city,
not leaving it.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.481
FIN:
Well, that kid's
not smart enough

13:34.514 --> 13:36.449
to pull that kind of stunt.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.852
I'll say Mama's taking us
for a ride.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.320
Sandra can't really think

13:40.353 --> 13:43.390
she's going to get
away with this.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.092
One of your kids
got into serious trouble,

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
what would you do?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.061
I don't know.

13:48.095 --> 13:48.962
Yeah, you do.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.098
You'd hire the best lawyer
that you could,

13:51.131 --> 13:53.300
and you'd tell them
to keep their mouth shut.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.168
You know how the system works,
Elliot.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.336
She doesn't.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.906
It doesn't make what
she's doing right.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.408
It makes her a mother.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.442
There she is.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.553
The subject's getting
into a cab

14:13.586 --> 14:14.621
going north on Avenue C.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.457
FIN:
Copy that.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.559
Taxi dropped
Sandra off here.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.928
She went around back.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.430
Munch followed
her on foot.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.165
Store's closed.
She got keys?

14:25.198 --> 14:26.166
Service entrance.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.600
Must be where she works.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.403
Any sign of the kid?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.272
MUNCH:
He's here all right.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.573
Any chance of back-up?

14:33.606 --> 14:36.343
We're on our way.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.414
Where is he?

14:41.448 --> 14:43.316
Storeroom.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.164
Police.
Don't move.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.465
STABLER:
Let's see the hands.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.532
Let's see the hands!
Up, up!

14:59.566 --> 15:00.533
Leave him alone.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.534
Come on.
Come on.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.470
You leave him alone.
Talk to me. Talk to me!

15:03.503 --> 15:04.437
Get out of the way,
Sandra.

15:04.471 --> 15:05.305
Get out of the way.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.140
He didn't do anything!
It's my fault!

15:07.174 --> 15:08.341
JOE:
Mom! Mom, help me!

15:08.375 --> 15:09.342
Just leave him be.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.444
Mom, what's
happening? Mom!

15:11.478 --> 15:12.946
SANDRA:
Talk to me!

15:12.980 --> 15:14.314
I was going to bring him in.
I was.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.515
Mom, help me.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.985
Was that before or
after your bus trip
to Phoenix, Arizona?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.619
Mom! Mom...
I'm trying to protect my kid!

15:19.652 --> 15:20.720
Mom!

15:20.753 --> 15:26.159
BENSON:
Joe, why did you shoot
Luke and Tyrell?

15:26.193 --> 15:27.594
Don't know them.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.029
You don't know them?

15:29.062 --> 15:31.464
You told us that
you went to school with them.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.665
No, I didn't.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.368
Joe, Joe, look at me.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.637
You're in serious
trouble here,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.639
and you need
to help yourself.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.441
Don't want to.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.711
Did you draw this?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.280
Where's my pen?
I want my pen!

15:47.314 --> 15:48.681
We can get you one.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.118
I know you drew that.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.652
Now, did you
also do this?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.287
You don't have
to answer that, Joe.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.291
Didn't draw that.
Didn't draw that!

15:59.692 --> 16:02.029
Joe, who-who's this?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.596
Who is this person here?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.698
( quietly ):
Zoltar.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.535
Who's Zoltar?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.271
No! No, I won't!
Stop!

16:11.304 --> 16:12.139
Come on, Joey,
take it easy.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.073
Calm down.
Hey, relax.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.507
Stop! I won't!

16:14.541 --> 16:15.675
It's okay.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.510
Zoltar's going to kill you.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.511
Are you Zoltar?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.313
He's going to kill you!

16:20.347 --> 16:22.382
All right, come here.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.383
Get off!

16:23.416 --> 16:24.051
He's going to kill you!

16:24.084 --> 16:25.618
Zoltar's going to kill you!

16:25.652 --> 16:27.620
We're stopping right now.
This boy is sick.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.589
He's going to kill you!

16:29.622 --> 16:32.059
Zoltar's going
to kill you!

16:32.092 --> 16:34.061
Joe's lawyer argues
that he's not competent

16:34.094 --> 16:35.062
to stand trial.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.063
I buy it.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.064
Kid could be acting.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.065
Ah, he's not acting.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.299
He's having
a psychotic break.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.300
Okay, the question is,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.335
was he psychotic
before he killed those two boys?

16:42.369 --> 16:43.536
Sandra gave me
his school reports.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.538
They mention moodiness,
irritability,

16:45.572 --> 16:46.539
lack of attention--

16:46.573 --> 16:48.641
these are all
signs of depression.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.211
He's probably got
Attention Deficit Disorder.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.579
A.D.D. doesn't turn kids
into murderers.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.347
HUANG:
No, but you've
seen his journals.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.348
His mom is right.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.749
He's a really creative kid

16:56.783 --> 16:59.186
with an elaborately dark
fantasy life.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.555
Unfortunately today, something
tipped fantasy into reality.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.457
So he really believes
that he's Zoltar?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.393
I once treated a kid
from a Special Ed class

17:06.426 --> 17:08.061
who whenever I asked him
a question,

17:08.095 --> 17:10.130
he got under the desk
and barked like a dog.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.764
Now did he think that
he was a dog? No.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.999
He's just
blowing off steam.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.136
Right. It was a displacement
activity to release his anxiety,

17:16.169 --> 17:17.604
and that's what Zoltar does
for Joe.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.571
It creates an escape.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.707
The question is:
what made him turn violent?

17:20.740 --> 17:23.543
Well, George Waddell
gave him a gun.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.278
That gave him the means to kill,

17:25.312 --> 17:28.148
but that's not enough
to trigger a psychotic episode.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.484
Okay, so what does?

17:31.518 --> 17:35.088
Alcohol, uh, drugs,
uh, lack of sleep,

17:35.122 --> 17:36.289
any other stressors.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.290
CRAGEN:
Okay, look,

17:37.324 --> 17:38.391
I feel real sorry for Joe,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.727
but I feel more sorry
for the two kids he killed.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.095
Now we want a
confession here, Doc.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.096
How do we get one?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.097
You let him rest.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.099
You get him something to eat,

17:46.133 --> 17:47.600
you get him
a paper and pencil,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.336
and you try again later.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.473
When did you last sleep, Joe?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.175
Wednesday.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.644
This is Saturday.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.146
That was three days ago.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.147
I can't sleep.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.614
I can't sleep!

18:01.648 --> 18:04.317
I get bad dreams.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.585
Are you taking
any pills, Joe?

18:05.618 --> 18:08.321
I don't want to.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.789
It's okay.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.159
Why don't you want to take
the pills?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.294
'Cause it puts voices
in my head.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.129
I can't hear anything else.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.798
They're talking so loud.
They're screaming!

18:18.831 --> 18:21.734
Stop! Please tell them to stop.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.403
Please, stop it!

18:23.436 --> 18:26.373
Please tell them to stop!

18:26.406 --> 18:27.540
Okay. Shh...

18:27.574 --> 18:29.809
Please!
Please, stop it!

18:29.842 --> 18:32.545
Joe... what are the voices

18:32.579 --> 18:34.647
telling you?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.517
They're telling me
to do things.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.219
You mean Zoltar?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.856
No one messes with Zoltar.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.795
Kids mess with you?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.699
All the time.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.701
They laugh at me,
they pull down my pants,

18:54.734 --> 18:57.170
they call me a shrimp.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.571
But Zoltar punished them.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.739
STABLER:
With a gun.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.882
They're running,
and I'm shooting.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.620
There's blood everywhere,
but they just won't die--

19:13.653 --> 19:14.754
not till I get close.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.756
Bang! Bang!

19:16.789 --> 19:19.459
They finally stop.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.561
I heard sirens.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.729
I ran to hide.

19:22.762 --> 19:26.633
I went to the boiler room,
but the window is too high.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.835
So I put the gun to my head.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.778
I don't remember any more.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.458
Can I see my mom now?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.962
Well, there's
your confession.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.931
You want to try him in
Family or Criminal Court?

19:58.965 --> 20:02.001
He's only 13,
but the murder was premeditated.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.605
The DA will insist
on charging him as an adult.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.641
We'll arraign on Monday.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.181
Barry!

20:15.214 --> 20:17.784
Alex, great to see you.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.952
What are you
doing here?

20:19.986 --> 20:21.488
Mr. Moredock has
taken Joe's case.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.722
But this is a murder case.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.591
There's no constitutional
issue here.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.925
Really? What about
the freedom

20:25.958 --> 20:27.294
to refuse medication?

20:27.327 --> 20:27.860
Fourteenth Amendment
guarantees

20:27.894 --> 20:28.861
the right to privacy.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.663
What are you talking about?

20:30.697 --> 20:33.566
It seems Joey's school
made him take Aptril,

20:33.600 --> 20:34.734
a psychotropic

20:34.767 --> 20:35.768
antidepressant.

20:35.802 --> 20:36.803
That's your defense?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.371
Some pills made him do it?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.939
Barry, he confessed to killing

20:39.972 --> 20:41.308
two of his classmates.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.742
You're wasting
your time

20:42.775 --> 20:43.876
and Mrs. Blaine's money.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.645
Mr. Moredock is doing this
for free.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.946
Before you
scoff, Alex,

20:46.979 --> 20:49.649
consult the Physicians'
Desk Reference

20:49.682 --> 20:51.951
for the known side-effects
of Aptril:

20:51.984 --> 20:54.321
abnormal dreams, anxiety,
insomnia...

20:54.354 --> 20:55.755
I suffer from anxiety
and insomnia.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.590
I don't go out and shoot people.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.625
Pleased to
hear it, Alex,

20:58.658 --> 20:59.992
but you should also look

21:00.026 --> 21:02.061
at the National
Drug Administration's

21:02.094 --> 21:03.696
labeling enclosure for Aptril

21:03.730 --> 21:06.933
which lists mania
as one of its side-effects.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.835
How can you try a child
for murder

21:08.868 --> 21:11.838
when he's got this poison
running through his system?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.873
How did you get so well-briefed
on the subject?

21:13.906 --> 21:16.909
You can thank the doctor
who called me about this case.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.545
What doctor?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.424
What were you thinking,
turning this case over

21:32.124 --> 21:33.960
to Barry Moredock?

21:33.993 --> 21:35.728
I'm concerned
about Joe Blaine.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.564
I knew Moredock
would share my concerns.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.966
So it wasn't enough you
had to call him in,

21:39.999 --> 21:42.669
you also handed
him his defense.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.505
I'm not against the use
of psychiatric drugs
to treat children.

21:45.538 --> 21:46.339
I just don't think
they should be used

21:46.373 --> 21:47.840
as an instrument
of school policy.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.542
Then publish an article.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.778
You had no business
interfering in my case.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.413
Thousands of children
are being forced

21:53.446 --> 21:56.549
to take powerful drugs without
psychiatric supervision.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.084
Before you crucify
Joe Blaine,

21:58.117 --> 22:00.953
maybe you should hear what
your detectives found out.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.523
What, now you're working
on Joe Blaine's defense, too?

22:03.556 --> 22:06.526
Alex, you weren't there--
this kid is seriously troubled.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.495
We spoke to his
school counselor.

22:08.528 --> 22:12.098
She said that Joe was
exceptionally creative
yet extremely disruptive.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.966
They suggested counseling,
medication,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.968
but Joe's mother
always resisted.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.371
Well, she said he
was special, needed
special treatment,

22:18.405 --> 22:19.872
so in the end, the
school insisted that
he go see their shrink.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.641
So that's who prescribed
Joe the Aptril?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.742
Apparently not--
Mom wanted

22:22.775 --> 22:25.678
a second opinion, so they
went to go see a Dr. Engles.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.016
All right.
Find out when Dr. Engles

22:30.049 --> 22:31.784
started Joe on the Aptril.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.453
Then I can decide
if I should take this defense

22:33.486 --> 22:36.489
as seriously as
Dr. Huang seems to.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.062
MAN:
Come on, Detectives,
you know I won't discuss

22:43.095 --> 22:45.432
a patient with you.
Fine, then we
won't discuss him.

22:45.465 --> 22:46.633
Just tell us what
you prescribed.

22:46.666 --> 22:50.069
That amounts to the same thing
and gets the same answer: no.

22:50.102 --> 22:54.140
Your patient just shot and
killed two of his classmates.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.609
The shooting at I.S. 41,
that was Joe?

22:56.643 --> 23:00.680
STABLER:
Yeah.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.949
Did you prescribe
the happy pills?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.717
I didn't prescribe
him anything.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.719
Well, he said he
was taking Aptril.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.054
He didn't get
it from me.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.522
Well, he and his mother
came to see you.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.525
And agreed to try
a course of psychotherapy.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.827
I thought Joe was bright
and willing enough

23:14.861 --> 23:16.563
to be treated by therapy alone.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.965
Obviously you were wrong.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.800
We'll never know.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.969
After the second session,
Joe's mother called

23:23.002 --> 23:26.005
and said I was not on her HMO's
list of approved doctors,

23:26.038 --> 23:29.208
and they were
refusing to pay for
the therapy sessions.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.844
Would the HMO have paid
for the meds?

23:31.878 --> 23:33.079
Of course.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.483
Therapy takes countless hours,
costs thousands of dollars.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.618
Prescribing meds
costs a fraction of that

23:38.651 --> 23:39.886
and takes five minutes.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.555
Okay, so why not
prescribe the Aptril?

23:42.589 --> 23:45.658
It's a standard medication
for children with depression,

23:45.692 --> 23:47.894
but I avoid prescribing meds
if I can.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.562
Why?
Because, frankly,

23:49.596 --> 23:51.230
we still don't
understand...

23:51.263 --> 23:57.169
what impact these powerful drugs
have on developing brains.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.705
CABOT:
So this whole drug defense

23:58.738 --> 24:00.006
is a fake?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.007
Joe's mental problems
aren't a fake.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.710
Both doctors who saw him
agreed he was depressed.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.713
Moredock can hardly
blame Aptril if Joe
wasn't even taking it.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.748
E.R. faxed over Joe
Blaine's tox screen.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.117
Negative for narcotics
and alcohol

24:11.150 --> 24:13.820
but not for
phenyl oxypropylamine.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.688
Aptril.
That's the baby.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.056
How recently
did he take it?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.791
Well, based on
the plasma concentration,

24:18.825 --> 24:21.694
M.E. says he took a pill about
24 hours before the shooting.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.597
But if a doctor didn't prescribe
Aptril, then how did Joe get it?

24:24.631 --> 24:25.732
I mean a 13-year-old kid

24:25.765 --> 24:26.866
can't just buy it
over the counter.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.702
He might've got it
from school.

24:29.736 --> 24:30.903
What do you mean?

24:30.937 --> 24:33.205
Well, you got millions of
kids taking psychiatric meds.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.708
School nurse stations
have more drugs than
some hospitals.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.710
They're not handed out
like candy.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.746
Good as.
STABLER:
And the drugs are being traded.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.214
I've heard of college students
snorting Ritalin

24:42.248 --> 24:43.149
just to help them
get through exams.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.884
Or to get a good buzz--
they're too stupid

24:44.917 --> 24:48.721
to know they're burning
their own brain out.

24:48.755 --> 24:51.858
Well, I know one person
I could ask.

24:51.891 --> 24:52.592
CABOT:
Did Dr. Engles

24:52.625 --> 24:54.193
give you the Aptril?

24:54.226 --> 24:56.663
I didn't want it.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.130
He said I'd feel better
just by talking.

24:58.164 --> 24:58.998
But you stopped
seeing him

24:59.031 --> 25:00.667
after two sessions.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.102
Did you go see another
doctor after that?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.804
No.

25:04.837 --> 25:05.938
( sighs ):
All right.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.174
Did a school nurse
give you the meds?

25:08.207 --> 25:10.977
Is there a purpose to this
fishing expedition, Alex?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.178
Well, if you and
Joe are claiming

25:12.211 --> 25:13.680
that Aptril made him a killer,

25:13.713 --> 25:15.948
I think we should know
where he got it.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.117
Joe?

25:18.150 --> 25:19.185
I don't know.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.152
Well, if you
won't tell me,

25:20.186 --> 25:22.922
I can only assume that
you got it yourself.

25:22.955 --> 25:23.890
Maybe you bought it

25:23.923 --> 25:25.892
from a kid at school.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.727
Maybe from the janitor,
George Waddell?

25:27.760 --> 25:28.527
I'm not sure

25:28.561 --> 25:30.062
what you're trying
to achieve here.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.931
I think it's
pretty clear.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.033
No doctor prescribed
the Aptril.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.768
Joe took it himself--

25:35.802 --> 25:37.904
not because he wanted
to get better

25:37.937 --> 25:39.906
but because he wanted
to feel good.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.808
If that's the best
you can do, Alex,

25:41.841 --> 25:44.844
I think we're going to have
a nice, short trial.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.646
Let's go, Joe.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.586
WOMAN:
Serotonin is one of the brain's

25:53.620 --> 25:56.155
chemical messengers--
it governs our moods.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.289
If it's reabsorbed

25:57.323 --> 25:59.792
into the brain too quickly,
people can have feelings

25:59.826 --> 26:02.862
of depression,
worthlessness, fatigue.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.365
And reuptake inhibitors,
such as Aptril,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.067
can block this reabsorption?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.336
Yes. They boost
levels of serotonin,

26:10.369 --> 26:12.271
and it can
relieve depression,

26:12.304 --> 26:14.073
giving a sense
of general well-being.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.608
Thousands of lives

26:15.642 --> 26:17.076
have been improved
by the drug.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.878
MOREDOCK:
So what's the bad news?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.714
In an FDA-approved
trial of Aptril,

26:21.748 --> 26:23.215
its maker, Tauscher-Leto,

26:23.249 --> 26:27.754
found that a significant
percentage-- 1.8% in fact--

26:27.787 --> 26:31.758
of those taking the drug
suffered a manic reaction.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.692
MOREDOCK:
How many people

26:32.725 --> 26:35.762
might be prone
to this "manic reaction"?

26:35.795 --> 26:37.764
Current estimates
are that between

26:37.797 --> 26:40.967
three and four million
children and adolescents

26:41.000 --> 26:43.335
currently take at least
one psychiatric drug.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.638
1.8% of that number?

26:45.672 --> 26:50.276
That's... that's between
50,000 and 70,000, huh?

26:50.309 --> 26:51.644
Yes.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.779
So between 50,000 and 70,000

26:52.812 --> 26:56.849
children and adolescents might,
at any time, be subject

26:56.883 --> 27:01.053
to these manic reactions,
might feel omnipotent,

27:01.087 --> 27:04.891
invincible... violent?

27:04.924 --> 27:06.693
Yes.

27:06.726 --> 27:11.030
Thank you, Dr. Petrus.

27:11.063 --> 27:14.366
Dr. Petrus,
as a child psychologist

27:14.400 --> 27:17.336
and psychopharmacologist,
you must be very familiar

27:17.369 --> 27:19.305
with FDA-approved drug trials.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.472
Yes.

27:20.506 --> 27:24.110
This trial that you quoted,
how many people were involved?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.846
I mean, actually
taking Aptril?
Uh, 190.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.817
190. That doesn't seem
like a very large number.

27:30.850 --> 27:34.153
Was that the only trial
that Tauscher-Leto did?

27:34.186 --> 27:35.755
There were others.

27:35.788 --> 27:39.859
And did they get the same
incidence of manic reaction?

27:39.892 --> 27:41.861
No.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.831
CABOT:
Isn't it true that in order
to have reliability,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.866
a scientific experiment
must be capable

27:46.899 --> 27:47.967
of being replicated?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.135
Yes.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.803
Yet the results of this trial

27:50.837 --> 27:52.004
have not been repeated.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.405
There is a wealth
of anecdotal evidence...

27:53.439 --> 27:54.741
Dr. Petrus,
I thought you were here

27:54.774 --> 27:56.709
as a scientist,
not a storyteller.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.145
Your Honor...
Nothing further.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.852
JOE:
It was like I was in a red fog.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.487
The blood was pounding
in my ears.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.990
The medication made
you feel this way?

28:11.023 --> 28:14.360
Yes. Like nothing
could stop me,

28:14.393 --> 28:15.494
nothing could hurt me.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.797
MOREDOCK:
So you killed those boys.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.131
Yes.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.500
And afterwards,
how did you feel?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.102
Like I wanted to die.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.104
I put the gun to my head,

28:25.137 --> 28:27.106
but my hand was shaking
too much.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.108
Did you want to take
this medication,

28:29.141 --> 28:31.978
this, uh, Aptril?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.112
No.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.381
I didn't want everyone to know
I was such a screwup.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.383
But still, you took it.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.051
Why was that?

28:39.085 --> 28:42.388
'Cause if I didn't, they said
I'd have to leave my school.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.791
Thank you, Joe.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.797
CABOT:
Joe, did you do
this drawing?

28:50.830 --> 28:53.232
Did you draw this?

28:53.265 --> 28:54.500
Yes.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.803
Dead bodies
in a gym,

28:56.836 --> 28:58.404
a masked man with a gun.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.439
What does it mean?

29:00.472 --> 29:04.043
Nothing. It's just a drawing.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.813
When did you draw it?

29:06.846 --> 29:08.380
I can't remember.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.217
Well, you dated it, Joe--
it's July 4.

29:11.250 --> 29:15.254
That's two months
before you were referred
to the psychiatrist.

29:15.287 --> 29:19.058
So doesn't that mean
that you had thought
about the shooting,

29:19.091 --> 29:20.793
planned it, even,
long before anyone

29:20.827 --> 29:22.995
ever mentioned Aptril to you?

29:23.029 --> 29:23.796
MOREDOCK:
Objection.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.865
Are the boy's
creative processes

29:25.898 --> 29:27.499
on trial here, Your Honor?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.269
Overruled. Answer the question.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.974
I thought about it...

29:35.007 --> 29:37.309
but I never
would've done anything,

29:37.343 --> 29:38.878
not without the drug.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.446
Who prescribed Aptril

29:40.479 --> 29:41.981
to you?

29:42.014 --> 29:43.315
I-I can't remember.

29:43.349 --> 29:44.016
You can't remember

29:44.050 --> 29:46.352
because no one prescribed it to.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.820
Who gave it to you?

29:50.957 --> 29:53.025
I don't know.
You said

29:53.059 --> 29:55.427
you didn't like Aptril, you
didn't want to take Aptril--

29:55.461 --> 29:56.795
how could you not know
who gave it to you?

29:56.829 --> 29:59.999
I told you, I don't know!
The truth is, you did
want to take Aptril.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.201
You wanted to find out
how it made you feel?
No!

30:02.234 --> 30:03.936
And the reason
that you can't tell us

30:03.970 --> 30:05.905
where you got it
is because you bought it

30:05.938 --> 30:07.239
or you stole it at school.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.908
No! Stop it!
Well, then how
did you get it?

30:08.941 --> 30:09.808
Stop it!
Tell me.

30:09.842 --> 30:11.844
Tell me, Joe,
where did you get
Stop it!

30:11.878 --> 30:13.045
the medication?
Stop it!

30:13.079 --> 30:14.213
Leave him alone, okay?

30:14.246 --> 30:15.581
Just leave him alone.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.383
I gave it to him. Okay?

30:17.416 --> 30:19.151
It was me.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.424
CABOT:
Sandra, why did you
lie to us?

30:25.457 --> 30:28.260
I told Barry Moredock.

30:28.294 --> 30:31.263
He said Aptril was the issue,
not where it came from.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.631
So it was your Aptril?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.300
Prescribed by a doctor?

30:34.333 --> 30:37.203
No. It came in the mail.

30:37.236 --> 30:40.106
You sent off for it, ordered it
on the Internet, what?

30:41.473 --> 30:44.410
No, it just arrived.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.980
It arrived just like that? When?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.982
Right after I'd
heard from my HMO

30:50.016 --> 30:52.651
that they weren't going to pay
for Joey's therapy.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.988
I just started a new job...

30:56.022 --> 30:58.290
and Joey was causing
all sorts of trouble at school,

30:58.324 --> 30:59.926
and I kept getting
these phone calls.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.028
My boss was on my case.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.896
And his counselor calls
and tells me

31:03.930 --> 31:06.198
that they're going to expel him
if I don't medicate him.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.468
And then this package arrived...

31:09.501 --> 31:11.403
with the Aptril.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.039
Just the Aptril?

31:13.072 --> 31:15.007
No letter, no nothing?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.442
No, there was a letter.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.254
This is on Tauscher-Leto
letterhead,

31:28.287 --> 31:30.156
signed by a Dr. Carl Medwin.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.091
Who's he?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.426
That's my doctor
from about three years ago.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.028
Well, he recommends
you try

31:36.062 --> 31:38.030
this new weekly version
of Aptril.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.466
Had he ever prescribed Aptril
to you before?

31:40.499 --> 31:42.268
Yes. I got depressed

31:42.301 --> 31:44.436
when my husband walked out.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.973
It helped me.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.540
So that makes it okay
to give it to Joe

31:48.574 --> 31:50.276
even though
he didn't want to take it?

31:50.309 --> 31:53.279
I love my son. Okay?

31:53.312 --> 31:56.082
I would never do anything
to hurt him.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.349
He was going to get
thrown out of school,

31:57.383 --> 31:59.018
and I was going to lose my job.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.619
So you forced this stuff
on your son

32:00.652 --> 32:02.488
so you could get to work
on time?

32:02.521 --> 32:04.323
No!
Did you talk
to a doctor

32:04.356 --> 32:06.058
or a nurse or anyone?

32:06.092 --> 32:08.394
Yeah, doctors, teachers,
the psychiatrists--

32:08.427 --> 32:09.395
everyone said he should be
on the Aptril.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.198
So why didn't you get a doctor
to prescribe it?

32:12.231 --> 32:16.268
Because I didn't want him
to get labeled.

32:16.302 --> 32:20.272
You know, those records, they'll
follow you your whole life.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.974
I came home from work one day,

32:22.008 --> 32:22.908
and there it was,
sitting on the stoop:

32:22.941 --> 32:26.578
Aptril, like some kind of gift
from God.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.347
I gave it to him--
I thought, you know,

32:28.380 --> 32:32.684
it'll make him better.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.653
( crying ):
No one will know,

32:34.686 --> 32:37.356
and everything would be okay.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.996
The pharmacy that sent
Sandra the Aptril

32:44.030 --> 32:45.597
says it was legitimate:

32:45.631 --> 32:47.366
a licensed physician
signed the prescription,

32:47.399 --> 32:49.001
all they did was
mail out the meds.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.602
But is there a crime here?

32:50.636 --> 32:51.770
Well, it's pretty sleazy.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.206
Sending powerful prescription
meds through the mail blind

32:54.240 --> 32:55.107
is more than sleazy.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.109
STABLER:
Tauscher-Leto
just gave me

32:57.143 --> 32:58.044
the run-around.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.646
The spokesman for
the CEO Dean Reynolds

33:00.679 --> 33:03.582
categorically denies
that his company would ever

33:03.615 --> 33:07.153
engage in
any unsolicited mail-out

33:07.186 --> 33:09.121
of their fine
pharmaceutical products.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.589
So how do they
explain the use

33:10.622 --> 33:11.690
of their letterhead?

33:11.723 --> 33:12.658
Ah, yes,

33:12.691 --> 33:14.626
a rogue sales agent
who will be disciplined

33:14.660 --> 33:15.894
as soon as he's identified.

33:15.927 --> 33:19.565
They didn't send this stuff out
of the goodness of their hearts.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.434
They were marketing it to people
they knew might use it.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.602
It's your call, Counselor.

33:23.635 --> 33:26.705
I don't think a doctor would
sign a letter to a patient

33:26.738 --> 33:28.240
he hasn't seen
in over three years

33:28.274 --> 33:30.442
without some kind of incentive.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.578
Let's find out
who was paying Dr. Medwin.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.717
MEDWIN:
It's my signature,
but I didn't write the letter.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.119
Did you even read it?

33:40.152 --> 33:41.220
Not until now.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.290
You know, Doctor, aren't you
the least bit pissed-off?

33:44.323 --> 33:47.759
I mean, they could have used you
to advertise crack cocaine

33:47.793 --> 33:49.295
and you wouldn't
have had a clue.

33:49.328 --> 33:49.995
The Tauscher-Leto
sales rep

33:50.028 --> 33:51.730
told me the letter would be used

33:51.763 --> 33:54.666
to market an improved
weekly form of Aptril,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.835
and that samples would be sent
only to those of my patients

33:56.868 --> 33:58.404
who had already
taken the drug.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.272
Right. How many of these
letters did you sign?

34:00.306 --> 34:01.607
Maybe two dozen.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.541
Did you also
give the company

34:02.574 --> 34:04.543
copies of your
patient lists?

34:04.576 --> 34:06.378
Only those with a history
of depression.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.615
With or without
their consent?

34:09.648 --> 34:10.849
I did not consult them.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.517
STABLER:
Oh, what the hell.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.351
You make a couple easy bucks

34:12.384 --> 34:14.786
off their medical problems,
right?

34:14.820 --> 34:17.456
I got paid nothing.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.392
They guaranteed a
three-month supply
of essential drugs

34:20.426 --> 34:21.860
for my clinic.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.695
Most of these patients
have no insurance.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.631
If I don't help them,
no one will.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.499
So you made a deal
with the devil.

34:27.533 --> 34:28.667
If it means giving

34:28.700 --> 34:32.204
poor patients the medicine
they can't afford, then yes.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.606
Anyway, Aptril is
a well-established drug

34:34.640 --> 34:36.508
with an excellent record
for treating depression.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.709
So what harm could it do?

34:37.743 --> 34:38.577
CABOT:
That's what one

34:38.610 --> 34:40.679
of your patients
who received it thought.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.314
So she gave the Aptril
to her son,

34:42.348 --> 34:43.849
who had a psychotic episode
and shot

34:43.882 --> 34:45.684
two of his classmates.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.720
Oh, my God.

34:48.754 --> 34:49.421
STABLER:
What's the name

34:49.455 --> 34:51.690
of this Tauscher-Leto sales rep?

34:51.723 --> 34:54.593
Jane Wellesley.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.663
STABLER:
Ms. Wellesley?

34:57.696 --> 34:58.664
Yes?

34:58.697 --> 35:00.432
I'm Detective Stabler, NYPD.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.601
This is Assistant District
Attorney Alexandra Cabot.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.470
I'm sorry, I have
nothing to say.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.873
How do you know
what we're going to ask?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.908
Why did you send prescription
drugs through the mail?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.643
I've told you, I
have nothing to say.

35:11.677 --> 35:14.146
Did Tauscher-Leto
know what you were doing?

35:14.180 --> 35:15.514
JANE:
Please, you're
in my way.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.882
These your kids?

35:16.915 --> 35:18.083
Give me that!
How would you feel

35:18.116 --> 35:20.619
if someone sent a package of
prescription drugs to your home

35:20.652 --> 35:21.920
and your girls
opened them

35:21.953 --> 35:22.754
and decided to give them a try?

35:22.788 --> 35:23.789
That would never happen.

35:23.822 --> 35:27.326
Well, something very much
like it did happen.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.429
Every sample we sent out was
to a carefully selected patient

35:30.462 --> 35:31.897
with a genuine need,

35:31.930 --> 35:33.765
together with a letter
giving precise instructions.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.367
STABLER:
Well, not precise enough,

35:35.401 --> 35:36.635
otherwise a 13-year-old
wouldn't have taken them

35:36.668 --> 35:40.306
and executed
two of his classmates.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.840
I have an appointment.
Excuse me.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.176
Did you say
"we sent out"?

35:44.210 --> 35:45.444
So it wasn't just you.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.180
Tauscher-Leto did know.

35:57.789 --> 36:00.492
( knock on door )

36:04.830 --> 36:06.798
I need your advice.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.700
Lie down on the couch.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.902
Not that sort of advice.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.475
What's up?

36:18.544 --> 36:21.313
I think that Tauscher-Leto's
direct marketing tactics

36:21.347 --> 36:24.983
were responsible
for Joe's manic episode,

36:25.016 --> 36:27.853
which led to his shooting
Luke and Tyrell.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.656
The company disclaims
all responsibility.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.957
All the sales reps

36:31.990 --> 36:34.426
are taking the Fifth.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.829
The trial re-starts tomorrow
and I think I'm going to win

36:37.863 --> 36:41.533
and I'm...
I'm not sure I want to.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.702
Then plead Joe out.

36:43.735 --> 36:47.373
How does that get justice
for Luke and Tyrell?

36:47.406 --> 36:49.441
It doesn't.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.377
You can't help them,
but you can help Joe.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.344
Plead him out
and he'll get time

36:52.378 --> 36:53.445
in a psychiatric
institution

36:53.479 --> 36:55.814
where his treatment
will be decided by
doctors,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.849
not insurance
and drug companies.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.721
That's justice.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.828
CABOT:
Your expert witness

37:09.861 --> 37:11.663
imploded on the stand,

37:11.697 --> 37:13.632
and Joe's drawings show
clear intent to kill.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.534
Take the deal.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.637
I think I'd rather
take the win.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.640
All right, let's
say you do win
and Joe walks.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.941
What happens then?

37:22.974 --> 37:24.876
MOREDOCK:
What do you mean?

37:24.910 --> 37:29.448
Sandra, you do acknowledge
that Joe has problems.

37:29.481 --> 37:32.884
Yes. They're not
all his fault.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.754
But they are the
reason that we're here.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.923
If Joe is released,
then what happens?

37:37.956 --> 37:39.491
He is dumped right back

37:39.525 --> 37:41.427
into the same
hopeless situation:

37:41.460 --> 37:42.661
HMOs that won't pay
for his treatment,

37:42.694 --> 37:46.598
schools that demand
he go on medication.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.700
How is he ever
going to get better?

37:48.734 --> 37:50.669
MOREDOCK:
What do you propose, Alex?

37:50.702 --> 37:51.670
Joe pleads guilty

37:51.703 --> 37:53.472
to manslaughter.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.073
He goes to a
psychiatric

37:55.106 --> 37:57.543
institution where he
gets the proper treatment.

37:57.576 --> 38:00.045
Do you understand
what she's saying, Joe?

38:00.078 --> 38:03.982
Yes.

38:04.015 --> 38:08.420
You have to decide
what you want to do.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.959
Wait... we're not going
to do this right now.

38:13.992 --> 38:14.893
CABOT:
We have to.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.095
The trial starts again
tomorrow morning.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.531
No, I have to think...
I have to talk to Joe.

38:19.565 --> 38:22.434
Mom, it's okay.

38:27.105 --> 38:30.108
You know what you want to do?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.978
I want to get better.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.021
( knock on door )

38:43.054 --> 38:47.593
Alexandra, did you do a
deal with Joseph Blaine?

38:47.626 --> 38:50.128
He pled guilty
to man two.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.799
Man two for a
double murder?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.601
I think you let
that oily-tongued,

38:55.634 --> 38:57.536
Tennessee weasel
Barry Moredock

38:57.569 --> 38:58.670
out-maneuver you.

38:58.704 --> 39:02.474
Mitigating circumstances
came to light during the trial.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.543
What mitigating
circumstances?

39:04.576 --> 39:08.547
A particularly egregious
instance of corporate greed.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.883
Corporate greed is
the beating heart
of America, Alex.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.952
I'm not accountable
to corporate America.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.054
But you are
accountable to me,

39:16.087 --> 39:18.089
and I won't let
two innocent boys die

39:18.123 --> 39:20.459
without punishing someone
for their murder.

39:20.492 --> 39:23.929
Do you believe this
bleeding-heart nonsense

39:23.962 --> 39:27.733
that Aptril
made Joe Blaine kill?

39:27.766 --> 39:29.635
Tauscher-Leto
put that medication

39:29.668 --> 39:32.604
into Joe Blaine's hands,
substantially diminishing

39:32.638 --> 39:34.806
his responsibility
for his actions.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.809
So who's guilty?

39:37.843 --> 39:38.944
I don't know yet.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.812
Then find out.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.114
And I don't care how high
you have to go.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.656
CABOT:
Jane? Jane?

39:50.689 --> 39:51.457
Don't you give up?

39:51.490 --> 39:53.158
There's someone
I want you to meet.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.526
I'm not talking to anyone.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.394
It's just two minutes
of your time.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.600
Jane, this is
Joey Blaine's mother,

40:01.633 --> 40:03.769
Sandra.

40:05.471 --> 40:10.008
Ms. Wellesley,
you sent Aptril to my home.

40:10.041 --> 40:13.545
You told me it was safe
and I gave it to my son.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.780
That was your fault.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.715
You shouldn't have
given it to him.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.118
Why? Because Aptril can
cause psychotic episodes
in children?

40:20.151 --> 40:21.587
Did your letter
warn Sandra of that?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.555
Those reports are unproven.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.090
No! My son proves them.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.061
I-I didn't come here
to attack you.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.501
I know what I did.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.068
I know what my kid did.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.004
And I have to live with that.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.205
But you and your company,

40:40.238 --> 40:43.008
you have to share
some of the guilt, too.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.076
The letter gave you
clear instructions.

40:45.110 --> 40:49.581
You didn't follow them.
I'm sorry.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.683
You have children, don't you?

40:51.717 --> 40:55.687
Yeah? Can you imagine
what it's like

40:55.721 --> 40:57.188
to know your own kid
is a murderer?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.595
Two boys are dead,

41:03.629 --> 41:06.698
their families
are destroyed.

41:06.732 --> 41:07.633
And I keep asking,

41:07.666 --> 41:10.502
why didn't I do something
to prevent it?

41:10.536 --> 41:12.604
How could I fail my own kid?

41:15.741 --> 41:17.876
Please, if you love
your children,

41:17.909 --> 41:22.748
please, don't let these people
destroy any more lives.

41:32.858 --> 41:33.859
What do you want from me?

41:37.596 --> 41:38.597
REYNOLDS:
In 2000,

41:38.630 --> 41:40.632
direct-to-consumer marketing
of pharmaceuticals

41:40.666 --> 41:43.068
was worth over one billion
in the U.S. alone.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.703
Now, that figure can only rise,

41:44.736 --> 41:46.738
and we're going to rise with it.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.307
What's this,
a hostile takeover?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.543
Funny man. Are
you Dean Reynolds,

41:51.577 --> 41:52.811
Chief Executive Officer
of Tauscher-Leto?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.713
I am. And you are?

41:54.746 --> 41:55.714
The police.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.315
This is Alexandra Cabot
of the DA's office.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.316
What are you
doing here?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.752
Uh, this memo approves
a direct marketing scheme

42:00.786 --> 42:03.589
wherein Aptril would
be mailed directly
to patients' homes.

42:03.622 --> 42:04.823
Do you recognize your signature,
Mr. Reynolds?

42:04.856 --> 42:05.891
Where did you get that?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.826
This approves of giving
doctors off-patent meds

42:07.859 --> 42:09.795
free of charge in exchange
for their patient lists.

42:09.828 --> 42:10.862
Is that your signature?

42:10.896 --> 42:11.763
I don't have to listen to this.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.899
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll resume later.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.901
And this third memo
threatens Tauscher-Leto
employees

42:15.934 --> 42:17.636
with breach-of-
contract lawsuits

42:17.669 --> 42:20.005
if they talk to either the
press or law enforcement

42:20.038 --> 42:21.973
about the Aptril
direct mailing scheme.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.174
Is that your signature?

42:23.208 --> 42:24.776
That's enough.
I'm calling my lawyer.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.745
Tell him to meet you
down at our lock-up.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.880
Dean Reynolds, you
under arrest for
reckless endangerment

42:28.914 --> 42:32.183
and for criminal diversion
of prescription medication.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.184
You have the right
to remain silent...

42:33.218 --> 42:34.586
But I haven't done anything.

42:34.620 --> 42:36.622
Stop it, you're hurting me!

42:36.655 --> 42:38.790
Take some Aptril, that'll
make you feel better.
