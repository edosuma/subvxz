00:00.013 --> 00:01.995
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:01.996 --> 00:03.376
- Sheriff Romero?
- Yeah?

00:03.377 --> 00:05.233
- I'm Marcus Young.
- Running for sheriff.

00:05.234 --> 00:07.235
You want to do what's in the
best interest of the town?

00:07.236 --> 00:08.486
Find the damn flash drive.

00:08.487 --> 00:09.704
I didn't particularly want to bring

00:09.705 --> 00:10.788
Marcus Young out here to take your job.

00:10.789 --> 00:12.240
You left me with no choice.

00:12.241 --> 00:13.407
Someone ran you off the road?

00:13.408 --> 00:14.826
Yes, and threatened me.

00:14.827 --> 00:16.327
Call Mr. Paris.

00:16.328 --> 00:17.879
I found out that Norma's brother

00:17.880 --> 00:19.714
has been staying up at Dylan's farm.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.382
He raped her. He's dangerous.

00:21.383 --> 00:22.633
And I don't understand how Dylan

00:22.634 --> 00:23.751
could have anything to do with him.

00:23.752 --> 00:25.303
Because it's his father.

00:25.304 --> 00:26.587
Is it really like she said it was?

00:26.588 --> 00:28.139
Maybe not exactly.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.557
And Ma, we were so close, her and me.

00:29.558 --> 00:30.842
We were all we had.

00:30.843 --> 00:32.259
He just wants to talk to you, to tell you

00:32.261 --> 00:34.145
he's so sorry that it ever happened.

00:34.146 --> 00:35.513
You have to try and understand.

00:35.514 --> 00:37.732
It's his father.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.599
Mother, stop it! You're scaring me!

00:41.520 --> 00:43.570
Leave me the hell alone!

00:46.275 --> 00:49.827
Norman, let her go!

00:49.828 --> 00:52.112
Mother!

00:56.785 --> 00:59.754
Get her back, Dylan! Get her back!

00:59.755 --> 01:01.289
Calm down!

01:01.290 --> 01:03.791
Not calming down! She's never left me!

01:03.792 --> 01:05.092
Stop it!

01:05.093 --> 01:06.460
No!

01:06.461 --> 01:08.262
You have to! She's coming back!

01:08.263 --> 01:11.349
She's not gonna come back! She hates me!

01:11.350 --> 01:13.601
She hates me now, Dylan,
and it's all your fault!

01:13.602 --> 01:16.437
It's not my goddamn fault!

01:16.438 --> 01:18.438
Ah!

01:20.309 --> 01:23.360
Shit.

Really?

05:18.764 --> 05:20.431
It's fine.

05:20.432 --> 05:22.549
There's no one here.

05:24.519 --> 05:25.719
Hello, it's Norma Bates. Leave a message

05:25.720 --> 05:27.104
and I'll call you back.

05:27.105 --> 05:29.523
Norma, you need to come home.

05:29.524 --> 05:31.058
Norman is losing it, okay?

05:31.059 --> 05:33.611
I don't know what to do with him.

05:33.612 --> 05:36.279
Mom, please.

05:44.206 --> 05:48.742
She's not coming back.

05:48.743 --> 05:50.878
She's your mother.

05:50.879 --> 05:53.747
She's gonna come back.

05:53.748 --> 05:58.252
This is what she does. She leaves.

05:58.253 --> 06:02.590
Just like she moved from
Arizona and didn't tell you.

06:02.591 --> 06:05.426
Just like we moved all those
times when we were little.

06:05.427 --> 06:09.229
Just like she left her home
and never talked to her parents.

06:11.650 --> 06:14.268
Only now she's leaving us too.

06:18.657 --> 06:21.024
No.

06:27.115 --> 06:30.117
You're different.

06:30.118 --> 06:32.285
She's not gonna leave you.

06:34.506 --> 06:36.706
You don't know her like I do.

06:41.296 --> 06:45.299
I think it's gonna be okay.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.301
She's just mad. She'll calm down.

06:54.609 --> 06:57.227
I feel strange.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.152
Like I'm outside my body.

07:10.625 --> 07:14.210
It's probably just from
getting knocked out.

07:17.415 --> 07:20.084
I'm sorry I had to hit you.

07:23.054 --> 07:24.721
Hello?

07:27.592 --> 07:29.592
Hello?

07:35.066 --> 07:37.234
Hey, Emma.

07:37.235 --> 07:40.187
Is everything okay?

07:40.188 --> 07:42.322
- Um...
- What happened?

07:44.859 --> 07:47.578
I'm worried about Norman.

07:47.579 --> 07:49.330
Yeah, he...

07:49.331 --> 07:52.283
My mom found out that my
uncle is staying at the farm.

07:52.284 --> 07:53.784
I told her.

07:53.785 --> 07:56.086
Norman was with me. He
was trying to back me up.

07:56.087 --> 07:58.672
She, uh...

07:58.673 --> 08:02.343
She totally wigged out on me
on a... on a whole new level.

08:02.344 --> 08:06.797
She's never left Norman before.

08:06.798 --> 08:10.551
Yeah. What can I do to help?

08:10.552 --> 08:11.802
Do you want me to stay here with you?

08:11.803 --> 08:13.470
I can sleep on the couch.

08:13.471 --> 08:15.472
No, I don't want to ask you to do that...

08:15.473 --> 08:18.142
You didn't. I offered.

08:18.143 --> 08:20.110
I've got some extra oxygen in the office.

08:20.111 --> 08:23.530
- I'll run down and get it.
- Emma, you sure?

08:23.531 --> 08:26.317
I mean, is... is it okay for
you to stay out overnight,

08:26.318 --> 08:28.118
breathing and all?

08:28.119 --> 08:30.237
I'll breathe here same
as I'll breathe anywhere.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.240
You don't need to be
alone with all of this.

09:11.973 --> 09:13.858
What... what happened?

09:13.859 --> 09:15.860
You got shot.

09:15.861 --> 09:18.145
You're not gonna die, but you're also

09:18.146 --> 09:20.807
not going anywhere for a while.

09:23.235 --> 09:26.203
Wh... wh... where's my
phone? It was in my jacket.

09:26.204 --> 09:28.072
Your phone, your wallet, and
your clothes are in the drawer.

09:28.073 --> 09:29.073
You don't need those right now.

09:29.074 --> 09:30.324
No, I need my phone.

09:30.325 --> 09:31.792
- No, you need to lie still.
- No!

09:31.793 --> 09:32.993
Do you need me to make a call for you?

09:32.994 --> 09:35.246
No, I-I want my damn phone,
and I want you to go away.

09:35.247 --> 09:36.714
Get me my phone.

09:48.927 --> 09:50.261
Hello, it's Norma Bates.

09:50.262 --> 09:52.096
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

09:53.265 --> 09:55.432
It's Alex, Norma.

09:55.433 --> 09:57.768
I wa...

09:57.769 --> 10:00.104
I-I was... I was shot.

10:00.105 --> 10:02.189
Though you... you got...
You gotta be very careful.

10:02.190 --> 10:04.992
You could be in a lot
of danger, so call me.

10:04.993 --> 10:06.860
Call me.

10:16.338 --> 10:18.871
I'm buying these.

11:16.765 --> 11:18.932
How can I help you, young lady?

11:18.933 --> 11:20.234
You know what? I'm... I'm sick of my car.

11:20.235 --> 11:22.352
I just want a new one.

11:25.991 --> 11:27.908
You got a little damage here.

11:27.909 --> 11:31.744
Look, I just... just want to
trade in my car, like, now.

13:14.466 --> 13:16.967
They'll stop soon.

13:16.968 --> 13:19.853
He's drunk. He'll pass out.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.909
Mother?

14:12.824 --> 14:15.191
Mother, where are you?

14:23.034 --> 14:25.202
Mother?

14:25.203 --> 14:28.922
Where are you?

14:28.923 --> 14:31.123
Mother, where are you?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.708
Caleb, I-I got to talk to you.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.572
Hey.

15:15.573 --> 15:17.073
What's the matter?

15:17.074 --> 15:19.458
What happened?

15:22.747 --> 15:24.914
Norman never told her.

15:26.417 --> 15:29.085
I finally did.

15:29.086 --> 15:31.921
I asked if she would talk to you, but...

15:33.925 --> 15:36.091
She won't do it.

15:37.929 --> 15:40.012
You're gonna have to leave.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.101
Hey, don't worry. It's all right, Dylan.

15:45.102 --> 15:48.021
I'll clear out.

15:48.022 --> 15:50.439
I'm sorry.

15:53.361 --> 15:54.944
Um, me too.

15:56.864 --> 16:00.699
Hey, go to bed, kid, okay?

17:15.693 --> 17:19.529
You look like you're gonna cry.

17:19.530 --> 17:22.031
Uh, if that's a pickup
line, it's a bad one.

17:22.032 --> 17:23.867
It wasn't.

17:23.867 --> 17:27.753
You just look like you actually might cry.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.456
Well, maybe you're projecting,
and you're gonna start crying.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.545
Well, it wouldn't be the first time,

17:35.546 --> 17:37.763
and it won't be the last.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.384
I'm Taylor.

17:44.555 --> 17:47.524
Never seen you in here
before. What's your name?

17:49.560 --> 17:50.727
I'm, um...

17:50.728 --> 17:53.446
I'm Norma Louise Calhoun.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.701
You're pretty, Norma Louise.

18:18.389 --> 18:19.922
You always this quiet?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.513
I ran out on my wedding today.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.398
You did not.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.899
I certainly did.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.569
He was a really nice guy.

18:32.570 --> 18:36.573
I just couldn't do it, you know?

18:36.574 --> 18:39.075
I-I have a problem with commitment,

18:39.076 --> 18:40.859
as in I don't get it.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.416
So...

18:46.417 --> 18:49.753
So you've never been married, Norma Louise?

18:49.754 --> 18:52.338
Mm...

18:52.339 --> 18:54.674
maybe once...

18:54.675 --> 18:56.342
but...

18:56.343 --> 18:58.011
there was something wrong with him,

18:58.012 --> 19:01.848
you know, like, mentally.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.684
Um, we couldn't stay together,

19:04.685 --> 19:08.521
so I had to kill him.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.534
Don't listen to anything
I say. I'm so drunk.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.620
I haven't made sense in the last hour.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.383
You want to go out to my truck with me,

19:37.384 --> 19:39.886
have a smoke?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.387
Mm...

19:41.388 --> 19:44.557
Mm...

19:44.558 --> 19:45.842
Okay.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.611
What are you doing?

20:38.612 --> 20:40.562
What does it look like I'm doing.

20:52.743 --> 20:55.578
Hey! You think it's okay
to get a guy all worked up

20:55.579 --> 20:57.831
- and then just leave?
- Leave me alone.

20:57.832 --> 21:00.083
You're a freakin' mess, lady!

21:00.084 --> 21:01.918
Screw off!

21:46.630 --> 21:48.681
Stop it, Juno. You're scaring it.

22:28.867 --> 22:31.502
Norman.

22:31.503 --> 22:34.355
Norman.

22:34.356 --> 22:37.608
Norman, talk to
us. We're here for you.

22:37.609 --> 22:39.693
Norman.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.963
I've never seen him like this.

22:43.964 --> 22:46.682
Norman.

22:50.054 --> 22:53.222
- What in the hell do we do?
- I don't know.

22:53.223 --> 22:55.224
Should we call an ambulance?

22:55.225 --> 22:57.060
No.

22:57.061 --> 23:00.729
No, this has happened
before. We... we wait it out.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.074
Hello?

23:11.075 --> 23:13.126
You know how hard it
is to find a pay phone?

23:13.127 --> 23:15.078
Who's this?

23:15.079 --> 23:17.880
It's Norma Bates.

23:17.881 --> 23:21.333
Are you okay?

23:23.087 --> 23:25.755
Uh... I got nowhere to go,

23:25.756 --> 23:27.256
and I don't want to be alone right now,

23:27.257 --> 23:29.926
so, uh, can I come over?

23:29.927 --> 23:34.146
Norma, what's going on?

23:37.434 --> 23:40.269
I don't know. It's like I'm
having some kind of a breakdown.

23:42.773 --> 23:46.909
So, please, can I just...
Please, can I come over?

23:46.910 --> 23:48.328
Okay.

23:48.329 --> 23:51.079
I want my mother.

23:54.785 --> 23:57.252
I want my mother.

23:59.923 --> 24:01.758
Let's put him in your mom's room.

24:01.759 --> 24:03.426
Maybe he'll feel safer.

24:03.427 --> 24:04.844
Okay.

24:32.322 --> 24:34.957
You okay?

24:34.958 --> 24:37.960
I know. It's attractive.

24:37.961 --> 24:38.995
I know this sounds weird, but could you

24:38.996 --> 24:40.830
possibly bang on my chest?

24:40.831 --> 24:43.082
I've got all this crap in
there that needs to get out.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.801
I know it's disgusting.

24:44.802 --> 24:47.420
My dad normally has the honors, but...

24:47.421 --> 24:50.056
Yeah, of course.

24:50.057 --> 24:51.674
Tell me what to do.

24:51.675 --> 24:53.725
Okay.

24:58.232 --> 25:01.733
Cup your hands and then
pound on my chest like this.

25:05.239 --> 25:06.856
Sorry.

25:06.857 --> 25:08.741
You've got to do it harder.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.359
You've got to knock all the
stuff off the walls in my lungs.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.278
I-I don't... I don't want to hurt you.

25:12.279 --> 25:14.997
You won't. I'm tougher than I look.

25:14.998 --> 25:16.749
Okay.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.417
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

25:20.254 --> 25:21.920
All right.

25:24.374 --> 25:25.875
You've got to do it harder.

25:25.876 --> 25:27.794
That's better.

25:39.723 --> 25:41.974
Sorry. There's...

25:41.975 --> 25:44.393
- phlegm on the floor.
- I'll clean it up.

25:44.394 --> 25:46.028
No, Emma, please...

25:46.029 --> 25:47.897
It's fine.

25:47.898 --> 25:49.732
I never should've let
you come here tonight.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.067
I didn't... I didn't realize...

25:51.068 --> 25:52.902
Don't say that.

25:52.903 --> 25:54.904
I wanted to.

25:54.905 --> 25:58.241
You have no idea how much
this family means to me...

25:58.242 --> 26:01.793
how much I want to be a part
of it, but... but never am.

26:04.248 --> 26:06.414
Yeah, I understand.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.753
You too?

26:30.440 --> 26:32.942
Oh, hi. How's it going?

26:32.943 --> 26:35.745
This is highly unusual.

26:35.746 --> 26:37.946
Yeah, welcome to my world.

26:51.378 --> 26:53.962
How you doing, Sheriff?

27:00.888 --> 27:02.438
What do you want?

27:02.439 --> 27:05.224
Relax.

27:05.225 --> 27:07.894
I'm not here to finish the job.

27:07.895 --> 27:10.061
No.

27:11.398 --> 27:13.198
What are you here for?

27:15.903 --> 27:18.905
They were talking about you at the club.

27:18.906 --> 27:20.740
Bob's done with you,

27:20.741 --> 27:23.042
says you're no good to him anymore.

27:23.043 --> 27:25.244
They're gonna kill you.

27:25.245 --> 27:28.164
Should've gotten the flash
drive back from that woman.

27:28.165 --> 27:29.916
Thanks for the tip.

27:29.917 --> 27:34.336
For my money, though, it's
a waste them killing you.

27:36.089 --> 27:39.759
I am gonna be the sheriff
here. That's a done deal.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.762
But you know this
place... The ins and outs.

27:42.763 --> 27:44.981
I could use a guy like you.

27:44.982 --> 27:48.184
I could keep you alive.

27:48.185 --> 27:50.403
I can handle Bob.

27:50.404 --> 27:53.655
He just needs to know
you're working for me.

27:57.194 --> 27:59.195
Yeah, I'll think about it.

27:59.196 --> 28:00.830
Excuse me.

28:00.831 --> 28:02.331
Visiting hours are over.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.200
On my way out.

28:04.201 --> 28:06.201
Give me one minute.

28:11.008 --> 28:14.210
I'll be back tomorrow for an answer.

28:14.211 --> 28:17.046
Then we'll proceed one way...

28:17.047 --> 28:19.631
or the other.

29:16.656 --> 29:18.689
So...

29:20.326 --> 29:22.326
What happened?

29:25.532 --> 29:28.200
My kids asked me to go talk to my brother,

29:28.201 --> 29:31.036
whom I haven't spoken to in years.

29:31.037 --> 29:34.706
Um, when we were growing up,
he was really terrible to me,

29:34.707 --> 29:37.459
and, um, I don't want
to talk to him, you know.

29:37.460 --> 29:41.380
I don't want to dig it up.

29:41.381 --> 29:43.015
Makes sense.

29:43.016 --> 29:45.217
Mm.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.218
Well...

29:49.355 --> 29:52.590
You're safe here, Norma.

30:01.501 --> 30:04.135
I don't know if I can keep living my life.

30:06.122 --> 30:08.490
There's so much I have
to deal with every day.

30:08.491 --> 30:11.242
I don't feel like I'm
dealing with any of it.

30:12.378 --> 30:15.464
Like what?

30:15.465 --> 30:17.833
Can I be honest with you?

30:17.834 --> 30:20.135
You're a therapist. You won't tell anyone?

30:20.136 --> 30:24.138
Not unless you're gonna
hurt yourself, someone else.

30:28.678 --> 30:30.229
My son isn't normal.

30:30.230 --> 30:32.064
There's something wrong with him.

30:32.065 --> 30:34.516
How so? Like, physically?

30:34.517 --> 30:36.768
Um, no, not physically.

30:36.769 --> 30:38.153
He... he had a brain scan,

30:38.154 --> 30:42.107
and his... his brain was normal.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.526
Uh...

30:44.527 --> 30:47.446
he has these blackouts,
and he loses himself.

30:47.447 --> 30:51.083
And I have killed myself

30:51.084 --> 30:53.418
trying to take care of him, to protect him,

30:53.419 --> 30:55.254
to keep it a secret.

30:55.255 --> 30:58.173
And the idea that he would turn on me,

30:58.174 --> 31:00.175
that he would ask me to do this thing...

31:00.176 --> 31:04.096
Okay, but why do you have
to keep that a secret?

31:04.097 --> 31:05.681
It seems like you're making it

31:05.682 --> 31:09.101
way more of a burden than it has to be.

31:10.803 --> 31:13.805
Norma, tell me... Tell me what's going on.

31:25.285 --> 31:28.370
You know how... you know how
my husband was in an accident?

31:28.371 --> 31:29.705
Yeah.

31:29.706 --> 31:33.492
It... it wasn't an accident.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.302
Your son did it.

31:43.303 --> 31:44.303
It wasn't like that.

31:44.304 --> 31:45.721
He was defending me.

31:45.722 --> 31:47.639
He... he... And he was blacked out.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.091
He didn't know.

31:49.092 --> 31:50.259
I called the insurance company.

31:50.260 --> 31:52.094
I told them that it was an accident

31:52.095 --> 31:54.646
because I didn't want them
to take him away from me.

31:57.150 --> 31:59.101
Oh, my God.

31:59.102 --> 32:02.154
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:02.155 --> 32:04.323
Oh, God, I hate myself.
I shouldn't have told you.

32:04.324 --> 32:05.691
I don't know why I told you.

32:05.692 --> 32:08.410
Why did I tell you? This... this is...

32:08.411 --> 32:11.330
You have to forget about
what I just said, okay?

32:11.331 --> 32:14.199
Promise me that you will
forget everything I said.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.501
Promise me! Promise me, please!

32:16.502 --> 32:17.586
- Promise me!
- Okay, Norma.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.037
I-I promise.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.340
Okay.

32:21.341 --> 32:23.041
I don't know why I even came here.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.793
Honestly, I'm so drunk.

32:24.794 --> 32:25.794
Like, don't believe
anything that I've said.

32:25.795 --> 32:27.346
Okay, just... just...

32:27.347 --> 32:28.380
Don't believe anything that I've said.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.682
Norma... Nor... Norma!

32:30.683 --> 32:34.052
Norma, stop it. Stop it, Norma.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.020
Norma, stop.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.061
It's okay.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.062
It's okay.

32:58.995 --> 33:00.328
It's okay.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.332
It's okay.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.333
It's gonna be okay.

33:09.172 --> 33:14.393
You've been carrying this
burden around alone a long time.

33:14.394 --> 33:16.812
Thank you.

33:16.813 --> 33:19.480
Thank you so much.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.021
We can't do this.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.609
I think you need me more
as a therapist right now.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.584
I could lose my license.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.233
Oh.

34:11.234 --> 34:12.567
What are you doing?

34:12.568 --> 34:14.235
Sit down, honey.

34:14.237 --> 34:16.071
I'm just making some breakfast.

34:16.072 --> 34:18.456
French toast.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.491
Are you feeling better?

34:19.492 --> 34:21.159
Oh, I'm fine.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.462
Got some beautiful blackberries yesterday.

34:23.463 --> 34:24.629
Will you get them out of the fridge?

34:24.630 --> 34:26.496
Norman?

34:28.418 --> 34:31.168
Norman's sleeping.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.804
Get me the blackberries.
They're on the bottom shelf.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.511
Okay.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.418
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm fine.

35:03.419 --> 35:06.537
Maybe just go wake up your
brother, so he can eat.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.541
My brother?

35:09.542 --> 35:11.093
Yes, silly.

35:11.094 --> 35:13.461
What's wrong with you?

35:15.465 --> 35:16.715
Nothing's wrong with me.

35:16.716 --> 35:19.217
So run upstairs. You know how Norman is.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.636
He'll sleep all morning
if you don't wake him up.

35:56.143 --> 35:59.262
He's still sleeping?

35:59.263 --> 36:01.847
I hope he had a peaceful night.

36:03.484 --> 36:06.268
I'm gonna go home and shower and change.

36:08.272 --> 36:11.356
Thank you, Emma. I can't thank you enough.

36:13.577 --> 36:15.527
I'll be back soon.

37:02.576 --> 37:04.327
Hey.

37:04.328 --> 37:06.162
What are you doing?

37:06.163 --> 37:08.164
Um, I was...

37:08.165 --> 37:10.133
I'm going home. I have to go home.

37:10.134 --> 37:11.801
Jesus.

37:11.802 --> 37:15.254
Norma, okay, stop.

37:15.255 --> 37:17.340
Look, I-I know it doesn't seem like it,

37:17.341 --> 37:19.809
but you're in a very
fragile state right now.

37:19.810 --> 37:22.261
You need to stop worrying
about everybody else

37:22.262 --> 37:24.263
and just take care of yourself.

37:24.264 --> 37:26.766
I hear you, but I can't
take care of myself.

37:26.767 --> 37:28.768
I'm a mother.

37:28.769 --> 37:31.521
Now I have to go talk
to my horrible brother.

37:31.522 --> 37:32.822
You know what, I have no choice

37:32.823 --> 37:34.273
because it is important to my sons.

37:34.274 --> 37:36.442
Yeah, and what about your own needs?

37:36.443 --> 37:38.578
Parents do not have needs.

37:38.579 --> 37:40.530
You ever read the book The Giving Tree?

37:40.531 --> 37:43.116
It's about a tree, and
this kid keeps coming

37:43.117 --> 37:45.118
and taking stuff from it his whole life,

37:45.119 --> 37:47.286
until there's nothing left but a stump.

37:47.287 --> 37:49.372
And then the kid sits on the stump.

37:49.373 --> 37:52.174
That's being a parent.

38:06.473 --> 38:09.475
Morning, neighbor.

38:09.476 --> 38:11.476
Hey.

38:14.481 --> 38:16.481
What happened?

38:19.236 --> 38:22.155
Yeah.

38:22.156 --> 38:23.622
Okay.

38:25.626 --> 38:27.493
So I'm gonna leave.

38:27.494 --> 38:29.412
I just wanted to give you another shot

38:29.413 --> 38:31.413
at that driving gig.

38:35.636 --> 38:37.636
When's it happening?

38:39.173 --> 38:41.507
Couple of days.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.643
That work for you?

38:43.644 --> 38:45.811
Maybe. Yeah.

38:48.182 --> 38:50.233
What is it exactly?

38:50.234 --> 38:52.517
This "driving"?

38:54.354 --> 38:57.356
No need to worry about that now.

38:57.357 --> 38:58.775
When you need to know,

38:58.776 --> 39:02.744
I'll tell you.

39:17.344 --> 39:19.344
Wake up.

39:21.381 --> 39:24.300
- Norma?
- Wake up, Norman.

39:24.301 --> 39:25.551
- Mother.
- Come on.

39:25.552 --> 39:27.103
Get up. We got to go.

39:27.104 --> 39:28.554
Where are we going?

39:28.555 --> 39:30.306
We're going to the farm
to talk to your uncle.

39:30.307 --> 39:32.358
This might not be the best time.

39:32.359 --> 39:34.193
You don't have to. It... it was a bad idea.

39:34.194 --> 39:35.561
It doesn't matter. The damage is done.

39:35.562 --> 39:37.395
We're going.

39:42.569 --> 39:44.237
Why are we doing this?

39:44.238 --> 39:45.238
Because I said we're doing it.

39:45.239 --> 39:46.289
I don't want to go!

39:46.290 --> 39:48.291
Well, neither do I,

39:48.292 --> 39:49.575
but I'm not gonna be the mom who
says, "I won't talk to your dad

39:49.576 --> 39:51.661
because I hate him because he raped me."

39:51.662 --> 39:53.463
That's not what parents do.

39:53.464 --> 39:54.881
So get in the damn car!

40:03.757 --> 40:05.842
Why does she have this car?

40:05.843 --> 40:08.677
Look, don't ask any questions right now.

41:22.135 --> 41:24.503
Norma Louise, I'm so sorry.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.672
I'm so sorry.

41:26.673 --> 41:30.309
I'm so sorry.

41:30.310 --> 41:33.596
I'm so sorry.

41:53.700 --> 41:56.335
I'm so sorry.

41:56.336 --> 41:58.800
I'm so sorry.
