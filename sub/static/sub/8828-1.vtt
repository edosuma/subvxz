01:09.172 --> 01:12.090
- You are not.
- Don't worry about me.

01:12.175 --> 01:13.753
Mm.

01:14.552 --> 01:17.921
- Hey, isn't that suit charcoal?
- No.

01:18.014 --> 01:22.391
Looks charcoal grey to me.
Some gray polyester blend.

01:22.477 --> 01:26.178
Couldn't you find a black suit
for your father's funeral?

01:26.272 --> 01:28.099
- It's black.
- It's grey.

01:28.191 --> 01:30.397
- It's black. Black.
- Grey. Grey!

01:30.485 --> 01:32.110
Fine, it's black.

01:33.404 --> 01:36.109
It's the greyest black
I've ever seen.

01:36.199 --> 01:38.607
- The colour doesn't matter!
- Oww!

01:42.288 --> 01:44.861
I'm sorry, Pop. I'm sorry!

01:57.386 --> 02:01.847
- Quick! Get him out of there!
- He's halfway to the harbour by now.

02:01.974 --> 02:03.848
Ah, well.

04:09.143 --> 04:12.642
"I leave you
not just a model factory...

04:12.730 --> 04:17.392
"but something infinitely
more valuable.

04:17.485 --> 04:22.562
"The future of string... itself."

04:31.666 --> 04:35.117
"And thus it is my dying wish...

04:35.211 --> 04:39.707
"that my two sons
run Smuntz String together."

04:39.799 --> 04:43.049
Great. Stick a "For Sale" sign up,
see what we can get.

04:43.136 --> 04:47.086
Ernie, we're not supposed to sell it.
We're supposed to run it.

04:47.181 --> 04:51.677
Either way, this godforsaken museum
piece is not worth a dime, is it?

04:51.769 --> 04:55.981
Some things are more important
than money, Ernie.

04:56.065 --> 04:59.101
The financially challenged
always say that.

04:59.193 --> 05:01.399
Uh, please, please.

05:01.487 --> 05:05.567
"I also bequeath to you
my personal effects,

05:05.658 --> 05:09.276
"including my ceramic egg,

05:12.165 --> 05:15.748
"half box of Cuban cigars..."

05:15.835 --> 05:18.124
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:18.212 --> 05:23.088
"M-my collection of spoons."

05:23.885 --> 05:27.586
My goodness,
what a treasure. What a legacy.

05:27.680 --> 05:32.721
Spoons! Spoons!
So many spoons, so little time.

05:32.810 --> 05:37.104
Oh! And, of course, something
no household should be without.

05:37.190 --> 05:39.942
The ceramic egg! Ooh-hoo-hoo.

05:40.026 --> 05:42.944
Can I have the egg?
Can I? Huh? Huh?

05:43.029 --> 05:46.445
- No. I want you to have it.
- Fine, I'll take it!

05:46.574 --> 05:50.406
If you find any real estate
on that desk, let me know.

05:50.495 --> 05:52.618
It seems there is also a house.

05:52.705 --> 05:55.623
- A house?
- Yes, 5120 Nortondale.

05:55.708 --> 06:01.212
Your father acquired it
many years ago as payment of a debt.

06:01.297 --> 06:05.509
H-he never lived there,
but i-i-it's interesting.

06:05.593 --> 06:10.504
It seems the previous owner was found
locked in a trunk in the attic.

06:10.598 --> 06:13.006
Wait a minute. Is it worth anything?

06:13.101 --> 06:16.221
Well, he was able to borrow
$50,000 against it.

06:16.312 --> 06:20.013
Really? So, what is its value today?

06:20.108 --> 06:22.065
$50,000.

06:22.151 --> 06:26.730
Great. A worthless house
and a broken-down string factory.

06:26.823 --> 06:30.737
Oh, well. At least the day
wasn't a total loss.

06:30.827 --> 06:33.532
Thanks for the stogies, Pop.

06:33.621 --> 06:37.785
Wait. You can't go. W-we
have to go through all these papers.

06:42.255 --> 06:44.828
You'll have to excuse me.

06:44.924 --> 06:47.759
I've got a date with the mayor.

06:52.098 --> 06:55.265
Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor, over here!
Mr Mayor!

06:55.351 --> 06:59.349
Will your recent triple heart bypass
affect your campaign strategy?

06:59.480 --> 07:01.722
Now, Leslie, I'm just here to eat.

07:03.317 --> 07:06.816
Ah, monsieur
le maire, Madame maire,

07:06.904 --> 07:08.529
welcome to Chez Ernie.

07:08.614 --> 07:12.065
What an honour it is
to have you in my humble bistro.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.656
Suivez-moi. You brought the little
ones. The little bicycle thieves.

07:16.747 --> 07:19.499
Bonjour! Our very best table.

07:19.584 --> 07:21.873
- Have you lost weight?
- Oh, I...

07:21.961 --> 07:25.579
I think so! I think you may be!

07:25.673 --> 07:28.342
Je suisse enchante
pour votre beaute.

07:28.426 --> 07:30.668
- You know?
- Oh, monsieur Ernie...

07:30.761 --> 07:33.881
Excusez-moi. Au revoir, les enfants!

07:36.893 --> 07:40.227
The air's not so thin at the top.

07:42.190 --> 07:45.357
Just like the old man to die
before I hit it big.

07:48.362 --> 07:52.739
Remember, everyone.
Attention to detail is vital!

07:52.825 --> 07:56.241
Presentation is everything.

07:57.330 --> 08:00.913
No, no, no, no, no!
These I must deliver myself.

08:10.635 --> 08:13.802
Duck a I'Orange
avec du quack sauce...

08:13.888 --> 08:17.720
And for ze Mayor,
la specialite de la maison,

08:17.809 --> 08:20.929
Lobster Loaf a la Ernest
ou la bibliotheque.

08:21.020 --> 08:23.428
- Oh...
- Bon appetit.

08:27.068 --> 08:29.310
- Ah, bonjour!
- How does it feel...

08:29.403 --> 08:31.976
to serve the mayor
after his re-election?

08:32.073 --> 08:35.240
- Well... May I call you Leslie?
- Of course.

08:39.580 --> 08:43.328
Crunchy! Hmm. I love the almonds.

08:43.417 --> 08:46.537
Leslie, cuisine,
she is a fickle mistress...

08:46.629 --> 08:50.674
Ee-yew! Look!

08:50.800 --> 08:53.089
A cockroach!

08:55.012 --> 08:57.005
That's only half a cockroach.

08:57.098 --> 09:00.182
Daddy! You ate the head!

09:00.268 --> 09:02.889
Honey, are you OK?

09:15.491 --> 09:17.697
Not again!

09:17.785 --> 09:20.276
Was this an accident or murder...?

09:20.371 --> 09:22.031
Clear!

09:23.207 --> 09:27.501
I can do that better!

09:35.094 --> 09:38.380
Smuntz String
is a relic of history.

09:38.473 --> 09:43.182
You don't make string by twining
two strands together any more.

09:43.269 --> 09:47.516
No. You make it simple,
singular, strong, with nylon.

09:47.607 --> 09:50.727
Bu-but that's not string.
Tha-that's cord.

09:50.818 --> 09:54.436
- Exactly.
- Twine is yesterday. Cord is today.

09:54.530 --> 09:59.239
Zeppco was interested in your factory
but your father refused to sell.

09:59.327 --> 10:01.284
We are hopin' you're smarter.

10:01.370 --> 10:03.861
Zeppco is willin'
to buy you out...

10:03.956 --> 10:07.076
and bring this museum
into the 21st century.

10:07.168 --> 10:11.830
We'd keep you on as a consultant,
with a huge salary and hefty pension.

10:13.508 --> 10:15.797
So...

10:15.885 --> 10:17.961
what do you say?

10:38.658 --> 10:42.276
- My sons...
- Ernie.

10:42.370 --> 10:46.831
- Ernie!
- Yeah. Just a sec.

10:46.916 --> 10:51.245
I want you... to have... something.

10:51.337 --> 10:54.671
My most prized possession.

10:54.757 --> 10:58.589
Oh, it's
a piece of st-string.

10:58.678 --> 11:03.174
Not just any string. THE string.

11:03.266 --> 11:08.687
I found it my first day in America.

11:08.771 --> 11:12.021
- What's with the string?
- I've had it 60 years.

11:12.108 --> 11:15.559
Here! I want you two to share it.

11:15.653 --> 11:19.520
Maybe it'll bring you
closer together.

11:19.615 --> 11:23.114
- You haven't talked much lately.
- Yeah.

11:23.202 --> 11:26.867
- Ah! What are you doing?
- I'm breaking it in half.

11:26.956 --> 11:29.910
- No! I want you to share it.
- No?

11:30.001 --> 11:33.037
- Forever.
- Sure, Pop, sure.

11:33.129 --> 11:36.213
You carry it the first 50 years,
I'll take it the next.

11:36.299 --> 11:39.004
- Sure.
- And turn up the morphine drip.

11:39.093 --> 11:41.216
I heard that.

11:43.681 --> 11:48.224
Promise me...
that you will never sell...

11:48.311 --> 11:51.597
Smuntz String...

11:51.689 --> 11:54.809
to one of those big conglomerates.

11:54.901 --> 11:57.392
Keep it between you.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.821
Brothers. Family.

12:00.907 --> 12:04.821
- Promise.
- I promise, Pop.

12:04.911 --> 12:08.695
- I promise.
- So, you were sayin'?

12:09.874 --> 12:11.831
I'll have to pass.

12:11.918 --> 12:13.875
What?

12:15.671 --> 12:19.799
"A world without string is chaos."

12:22.094 --> 12:25.130
For once the Smuntz name
was worth something!

12:25.223 --> 12:27.132
- No, no! Don't!
- Oh!

12:29.227 --> 12:31.469
You... You used to love string!

12:31.562 --> 12:35.939
That was when I was dating
the son of a wealthy string magnate!

12:36.025 --> 12:41.102
Not now, when I am married to the
owner... of a worthless death-trap!

12:43.658 --> 12:47.109
I thought you'd be happy!
I stood up for myself today!

12:47.203 --> 12:49.279
April, I've got new ideas.

12:49.372 --> 12:51.448
You know, I've got big plans!

12:51.541 --> 12:55.621
Don't you see, Lars?
That's all you've ever had are plans.

12:55.711 --> 13:00.539
But my life is passing me by,
and I... I need more!

13:00.633 --> 13:05.509
There's no air in the middle class,
Lars. I can't breathe here.

13:05.596 --> 13:07.968
Please, April, don't go.

13:08.057 --> 13:10.465
I'm not going anywhere.

13:27.034 --> 13:31.363
'In a few moments, the joy
of the holidays was shattered...

13:31.456 --> 13:34.125
'and the world changed
for many people.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.450
'Mayor McKrinkle died at 4:30 p.m.,

13:36.544 --> 13:38.833
'at Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

13:38.921 --> 13:41.542
'Doctors say
the cause of death is...

13:41.632 --> 13:45.381
'heart failure due to
the mayor's culinary disaster.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.926
'And once the hottest restaurant...

13:48.014 --> 13:50.968
'Chez Ernie is scheduled
for demolition.'

13:51.058 --> 13:55.270
I-I don't think I ordered
my cheese sandwich with capers.

13:55.354 --> 13:58.390
- 'We go live to Leslie Reinhart.'
- Sorry.

13:58.483 --> 14:01.567
'If this tragedy has a villain
it is Ernie Smuntz.

14:01.694 --> 14:04.363
- 'Once a local...'
- Ernie, you're on TV!

14:04.447 --> 14:07.020
What? Oh.

14:07.116 --> 14:09.524
You know what this is? I'll tell ya.

14:09.619 --> 14:12.288
- Guilt by accusation.
- No capers.

14:12.371 --> 14:15.657
But that's just grilled cheese.
What's the point?

14:15.750 --> 14:17.992
Why don't they eat out of a trough?

14:18.085 --> 14:22.297
Which one of you palateless sheep
sent my sandwich back?

14:22.381 --> 14:24.338
Hi, Ernie!

14:24.425 --> 14:25.919
Lars?

14:27.720 --> 14:30.555
When I'm in the kitchen,
I cook.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.178
I can't control everything in there.

14:33.267 --> 14:36.351
You know,
it isn't fair to blame you.

14:36.437 --> 14:41.265
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- But society likes to persecute.

14:41.359 --> 14:46.270
A scapegoat, someone to demonise.
The same thing happened to Galileo.

14:46.364 --> 14:49.282
Really? That's unbelievable.

14:49.367 --> 14:51.692
With a cockroach and everything?

14:51.786 --> 14:56.115
No. The point is, I put everything
into that restaurant.

14:56.207 --> 14:58.615
It was my livelihood and my home.

14:58.709 --> 15:01.959
In one fatal bite,
it was all taken away from me.

15:02.046 --> 15:04.169
If only we could sell the factory.

15:04.257 --> 15:09.797
I'd let you stay with me, you know,
but, uh, April threw me out.

15:09.887 --> 15:13.505
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah, well, don't worry about me.

15:13.599 --> 15:16.933
April's been like this
since high school.

15:17.019 --> 15:20.305
- She'll be back. I...
- Would you look at them?

15:20.398 --> 15:24.348
Sleeping in the street. Pitiful.

15:26.404 --> 15:29.191
If I had a house, I'd sleep in it!

15:29.282 --> 15:34.786
- Remember how close we were as kids?
- No.

15:34.871 --> 15:38.370
Hey! Merry Christmas!

15:38.458 --> 15:40.581
Yeah, I was on top once too.

15:40.668 --> 15:45.579
But there's only one way to go from
there, and that's down, baby, down!

15:45.715 --> 15:47.043
Oh!

15:48.301 --> 15:50.210
Ernie.

15:50.303 --> 15:54.431
Ernie! Ernie, there was
a quarter in there.

15:54.515 --> 15:59.224
A quarter? You think so small, Lars.

15:59.312 --> 16:04.188
Look at the bigger picture.
You have no home, no wife, no money.

16:04.275 --> 16:08.107
You have no discernible talents.
How can you ignore that?

16:08.196 --> 16:11.731
Ernie, it's Christmas.

16:11.824 --> 16:16.036
Instead of dwelling on what we lack,
let's be thankful for what we have.

16:16.120 --> 16:22.834
â™ª If only in my dreams â™ª

17:10.090 --> 17:12.249
What a dump.

17:21.144 --> 17:24.893
Wow! I can't believe Pops
never told us about this house.

17:26.732 --> 17:28.725
It's huge.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.523
This is
the kind of house he'd have.

17:31.612 --> 17:34.566
It's just like him. Cold and spooky.

17:38.870 --> 17:43.117
- Wow! Did you feel that?
- What?

17:43.207 --> 17:46.541
I got a chill. You shouldn't
talk about Pop like that.

17:46.627 --> 17:49.414
Really? What's this do for you?

17:49.505 --> 17:54.333
Thanks for nothing,
you string-sucking old loon!

17:56.971 --> 17:59.379
He didn't mean it, Pop.

18:01.726 --> 18:04.098
Ernie! Ernie!

18:11.819 --> 18:15.520
Only one bed.
I'll flip you for it.

18:17.742 --> 18:19.948
Heads.

18:38.262 --> 18:40.420
E-Ernie?

18:42.183 --> 18:45.967
Ernie. Ernie.

18:46.062 --> 18:48.814
- You asleep?
- I was.

18:48.898 --> 18:52.184
How can you sleep through that?

18:52.276 --> 18:55.610
- What? I don't hear anything.
- Shh-shh-shh. That.

18:55.696 --> 18:59.279
Listen. Hear it?
It's coming from upstairs.

19:20.138 --> 19:22.261
Mothballs.

19:26.644 --> 19:29.930
H-hey, stop it! Hey! Ow!

19:38.906 --> 19:41.444
Ernie! Ernie!

20:21.407 --> 20:23.530
Wait. Wait a minute. Stop. Stop!

20:23.618 --> 20:27.568
Look. Look, look, look.
It's only a toy.

20:34.921 --> 20:37.542
Ah, shut up!

20:43.638 --> 20:45.880
It's coming from up there!

20:48.559 --> 20:52.308
One, two, three!

20:57.193 --> 20:58.984
Ooh!

20:59.987 --> 21:03.438
- It's just a mouse.
- What?

21:03.533 --> 21:07.661
It's just a mouse. Never mind.

21:07.745 --> 21:10.995
Hey, there are some posters up here.

21:11.082 --> 21:14.416
Oh! Stand still!

21:27.557 --> 21:30.344
- They're blueprints.
- Wow!

21:30.435 --> 21:34.018
Wait a minute.
Look at this date. 1876.

21:34.105 --> 21:37.806
A centennial house could actually
be worth something.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.605
Look, this must be the architect.
Look.

21:40.695 --> 21:44.064
Charles Lyle LaRue.

21:45.366 --> 21:50.705
- Charles Lyle LaRue.
- Charles Lyle LaRue?

21:54.417 --> 21:57.204
Charles Lyle LaRue.

21:59.297 --> 22:02.417
Charles Lyle LaRue!

22:02.717 --> 22:05.753
Charles Lyle LaRue!

22:05.845 --> 22:10.840
I'm actually standing
in the missing LaRue!

22:10.933 --> 22:14.717
- It's bold yet subtle.
- Classical yet non-traditional.

22:14.812 --> 22:17.018
The missing LaRue.

22:17.106 --> 22:21.234
The rumoured design completed before
his committal isn't a rumour.

22:21.319 --> 22:23.228
Before his committal?

22:23.321 --> 22:25.527
I'm just glad he finished it...

22:25.615 --> 22:30.573
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy.

22:30.661 --> 22:35.323
So, what do you think a magnificent
edifice like this is worth?

22:35.416 --> 22:37.456
Properly restored, of course.

22:37.543 --> 22:41.208
Well, his Parma Charnel House
went for six...

22:41.297 --> 22:45.129
But that was 10 years ago,
and it didn't have this moulding.

22:45.218 --> 22:48.302
I see. I can't get enough
of good moulding.

22:50.556 --> 22:54.305
- Did you hear that? $600,000.
- Phew.

22:54.393 --> 22:56.682
Alexander Falko!

22:56.771 --> 22:58.598
Back!

22:58.689 --> 23:01.310
Gentlemen, congratulations.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.564
Congratulations on your find.
I'm a great admirer of LaRue.

23:05.655 --> 23:10.234
- Glass of rainwater, please.
- The leading collector of LaRues.

23:10.326 --> 23:14.324
Sort of like collecting stamps,
but bigger?

23:14.413 --> 23:18.992
I'll get to the point. LaRue.
I have his books and his letters.

23:19.085 --> 23:21.208
You see these shoes?

23:21.295 --> 23:24.296
- LaRues?
- No, but he would love them.

23:24.382 --> 23:27.585
Vegetarian snack. I own...

23:27.677 --> 23:31.757
42 LaRue houses. 42.
I want to make it 43.

23:31.848 --> 23:34.137
You tell me how I'm going to do this.

23:34.225 --> 23:37.676
Tell me how I will do this.
Help me. How will I do this?

23:37.770 --> 23:39.679
Well, I'm, uh, glad you asked.

23:39.772 --> 23:42.975
His Parma Charnel House
went for six, ten years ago,

23:43.067 --> 23:45.439
but it didn't have this moulding.

23:45.528 --> 23:48.564
A find like this today
is worth twice as much.

23:48.656 --> 23:52.155
- He's a LaRue connoisseur.
- Guilty as charged.

23:52.243 --> 23:55.363
Gentlemen, I'm going
to make you an offer.

23:55.455 --> 23:58.990
No, no, no, I couldn't be so crass
as to allow you to do that.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.752
But you are welcome
to come to the auction.

24:01.836 --> 24:03.663
- Auction?
- Auction, yes.

24:03.754 --> 24:08.463
It would be unfair of us to deprive
others of the chance to bid.

24:08.551 --> 24:10.923
Um...

24:11.012 --> 24:14.262
May I have one moment
with my brother, please?

24:14.348 --> 24:16.506
- Sure. Of course.
- Thank you.

24:18.102 --> 24:19.762
- What is this?
- It's the...

24:19.854 --> 24:22.890
- What is this? No.
- It's the first I've heard...

24:25.151 --> 24:28.437
- What are you doing?
- Answering your prayers.

24:28.529 --> 24:30.735
These pigeons are ripe for plucking.

24:30.823 --> 24:33.279
Put them in a room
to outbid each other?

24:33.367 --> 24:37.281
- We'll make $700,000, $800,000 easy.
- Man, you're smart!

24:37.371 --> 24:39.198
Oof!

24:39.290 --> 24:41.662
- You'll get it...
- Don't talk to me!

24:41.751 --> 24:44.954
So, when is the, uh,
earliest we can set the auction?

24:45.046 --> 24:49.174
I suppose all arrangements
could be completed within the week.

24:49.258 --> 24:51.298
- A week it is.
- Great!

24:51.385 --> 24:55.632
- You're smarter than you look.
- Thank you.

24:56.641 --> 24:58.550
But know this.

24:58.643 --> 25:02.972
I have never paid more than $10
million for a house in my life!

25:17.453 --> 25:19.529
OK, see you, then.

25:19.622 --> 25:22.291
Yeah. Thanks for stopping by.

25:28.297 --> 25:31.333
Ten million linen napkins.

25:31.425 --> 25:34.924
Five million bales
of top-grade cotton fibre.

25:35.054 --> 25:39.597
Forty thousand hot lamps complete
with rotating plate-warming trays.

25:39.684 --> 25:43.433
Two thousand twine threaders,
gleaming under real lights.

25:43.563 --> 25:46.517
My own chain of restaurants.

25:46.607 --> 25:50.474
April can have
anything she's ever wanted!

25:50.570 --> 25:54.235
Cars, coats, china.
She loves china.

25:56.325 --> 25:59.279
I'm gonna build
a swimming pool...

25:59.370 --> 26:02.157
full of pina coladas
and a college girls.

26:05.918 --> 26:08.872
If only Pop
could've seen this house!

26:08.963 --> 26:12.047
He did. He just wasn't
smart enough to sell it.

26:12.133 --> 26:15.584
We've turned a corner.
Our future is staring us in the face.

26:15.678 --> 26:20.969
All we have to do is grab it,
baste it, and scarf it down!

26:30.193 --> 26:33.527
Aha! We've finally found
our friend's home!

26:33.613 --> 26:36.282
Well, I bought
a present for ya, buddy.

26:36.365 --> 26:41.442
Ernie, i-it's just a little mouse.
Do we really have to kill it?

26:41.537 --> 26:45.404
Yes. Listen to me.
A single vermin can bring you down.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.834
Believe me, I know. Ah...

27:34.507 --> 27:39.252
- I trust you slept well.
- Oh! Like a baby.

27:47.812 --> 27:50.517
Hey, last night,
did you hear the, uh...

27:50.606 --> 27:53.856
Oh, yeah. Let's see.

28:01.993 --> 28:05.777
- Well, where'd he go?
- Maybe it snapped by itself.

28:07.582 --> 28:10.120
I don't believe it.

28:10.209 --> 28:15.665
He snapped the trap, ate the olive,
and left the pit just to mock us.

28:15.756 --> 28:19.706
You're giving him
a little too much credit.

28:19.802 --> 28:23.420
Mice don't mock.
They don't have a sense of humour.

28:23.514 --> 28:26.681
He's not sitting in his hole
in a smoking jacket,

28:26.768 --> 28:29.804
sipping cognac,
giggling "I left the pit."

28:29.896 --> 28:33.645
The trap snapped itself,
the olive flew off, and he ate it.

28:33.733 --> 28:37.683
But now he knows we're here,
he won't come near us.

28:37.779 --> 28:40.484
We won't be seeing that... Mouse!

28:43.534 --> 28:45.942
Aha! Ow!

28:47.413 --> 28:51.078
What are you doing, ya stupid nitwit?

28:53.169 --> 28:55.625
Don't let him get away!

29:13.689 --> 29:15.646
Ow!

29:18.945 --> 29:20.902
Ow!

29:23.908 --> 29:26.233
Are you trying to kill me?

29:28.121 --> 29:29.699
Ah, the mouse!

29:31.916 --> 29:34.241
Let me see. Let me see!

29:34.335 --> 29:36.209
Can you see him?

29:37.713 --> 29:40.418
Get me my Gouda.

29:43.010 --> 29:46.960
- Careful, careful!
- Don't touch me. You'll snap it.

29:47.056 --> 29:49.132
You're not doin' it right.

29:49.225 --> 29:52.143
Put it on carefully.
I am.

29:52.228 --> 29:55.264
Oh, relax. It's cheese.

29:56.691 --> 29:58.565
Bon appetit.

30:00.695 --> 30:03.898
That takes care of that. Huh?

30:17.170 --> 30:19.079
Oh! Oh!

30:25.845 --> 30:27.470
Hey!

30:28.431 --> 30:30.507
Hey! What are you doin'?

32:48.529 --> 32:51.281
Lars! Gimme a hand with this.

32:56.913 --> 32:59.700
You sure this tub
fits with the house?

32:59.791 --> 33:02.329
Jacuzzi tub, Lars.
It's a Jacuzzi tub.

33:02.418 --> 33:05.170
And this isn't just a house.
It's a LaRue.

33:05.254 --> 33:07.211
Of course it fits the decor.

33:07.298 --> 33:10.465
- Luxury is timeless.
- How much, Ernie?

33:10.551 --> 33:13.635
It was a steal at $1200.

33:13.721 --> 33:15.714
$1200?

33:15.807 --> 33:18.298
You spent our last money on a tub!

33:18.392 --> 33:20.219
A Jacuzzi tub!

33:20.311 --> 33:22.980
You have to spend money
to make money.

33:23.064 --> 33:25.637
They threw in the cardboard lady too.

34:04.897 --> 34:07.981
Well...

34:15.824 --> 34:19.408
Don't you think
this is a little... much?

34:19.495 --> 34:23.623
Never underestimate your opponent.

34:23.708 --> 34:29.295
Say he has mastered a way to empty
a mousetrap without getting caught.

34:29.380 --> 34:31.752
If he snaps one of these babies,

34:31.841 --> 34:35.043
a chain reaction
will start snapping them all.

34:35.136 --> 34:38.422
The law of averages
says one has to nab him.

34:40.516 --> 34:42.473
Not bad.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.309
Yes. Well, I like
to use both sides of my brain.

34:46.397 --> 34:48.271
Come on, let's hit the sack.

35:25.394 --> 35:28.015
- Have you figured it out yet?
- Shut up.

35:28.106 --> 35:30.478
I'm thinking. I'm thinking!

35:44.205 --> 35:46.613
Ernie. Ernie!

35:51.087 --> 35:56.082
Keep perfectly still. This is it.

36:14.944 --> 36:17.316
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

36:29.584 --> 36:32.122
That was good.

36:52.899 --> 36:55.472
Shh! He's goin' for the cherries!

36:58.821 --> 37:00.695
You said mice like Gouda.

37:00.782 --> 37:03.949
Not in the morning!
They need fruit for energy.

37:23.054 --> 37:26.672
Oh, no!

37:34.857 --> 37:36.933
Ow! Ow.

37:47.286 --> 37:50.240
- Aah... Ow!
- D-D-D-D-D-D-D.

37:56.212 --> 37:58.039
There he goes!

38:01.134 --> 38:03.803
- Juice!
- Got it!

38:08.141 --> 38:10.430
This game is over!

38:25.575 --> 38:27.983
- I think it's working!
- Yeah.

38:32.665 --> 38:35.583
Whoa! Uh! I felt something.

38:35.668 --> 38:38.622
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Keep sucking!

38:46.095 --> 38:50.009
Goddamn, that mouse stinks!

38:50.099 --> 38:52.056
Dead animals always do.

38:52.143 --> 38:54.681
Ohh!

39:05.198 --> 39:07.950
Keep sucking!

39:08.034 --> 39:10.192
Oh, yeah, this'll get him!

39:33.392 --> 39:36.843
- What's this?
- We're foreclosing on your house.

39:36.938 --> 39:39.061
You quit paying your mortgage.

39:39.148 --> 39:43.940
Oh, wait a minute, there's some
mistake, this house is paid for.

39:44.028 --> 39:46.484
It was, but you borrowed against it.

39:46.572 --> 39:49.941
If you don't pay the $1200,
we repossess it.

39:50.034 --> 39:53.866
- $1200?
- Well, how long do we have?

39:53.955 --> 39:59.080
One week from, uh... five days ago.

39:59.168 --> 40:02.003
But, uh, that's two days!

40:02.088 --> 40:04.793
We don't have the time
or energy for this.

40:04.882 --> 40:08.002
We're in the midst
of an extensive renovation.

40:08.094 --> 40:11.593
Looks like you're off
to a great start.

40:13.057 --> 40:16.426
Ask your boss for an advance.
Pay him back later.

40:16.519 --> 40:20.564
Couldn't your workers
forfeit their salaries?

40:20.648 --> 40:24.860
If you hadn't spent all our money
on that tub, we might be able to pay.

40:24.944 --> 40:28.313
It doesn't help to start crying.

40:28.406 --> 40:31.442
No, Fluffy! No!

40:31.534 --> 40:34.321
No! I want my kitty!

40:34.412 --> 40:38.908
No, no, no!

40:51.888 --> 40:54.509
That one's cute.

40:54.599 --> 40:58.549
He doesn't have a killer instinct.

41:15.495 --> 41:19.279
Morning, gentlemen. I'm Maury.
Can I help you?

41:19.373 --> 41:21.829
Uh, hi, Maury. W-we need a cat.

41:23.628 --> 41:28.005
Find the one you want
and I'll spay or neuter it myself.

41:28.090 --> 41:30.877
Well, these are all kittens.

41:30.968 --> 41:34.633
We were hoping for an older cat.
One with experience.

41:34.722 --> 41:38.506
Most people like cute little ones.
Experience with what?

41:38.601 --> 41:41.637
- Mouse hunting.
- All cats are good mousers.

41:41.729 --> 41:45.063
But we have huge rats,
the size of sumo wrestlers.

41:45.149 --> 41:50.060
So, we need a ferocious feline
with a history of mental illness.

41:50.154 --> 41:52.360
I'm talkin'... one mean pussy.

41:52.448 --> 41:55.568
Yeah! A vicious cat,
difficult to love.

41:55.660 --> 41:58.531
Do you have any of those
knocking around?

41:58.621 --> 42:03.746
Funny you should ask. I had all
but given up on anyone wanting him.

42:03.835 --> 42:07.085
We were about to gas him again.

42:07.171 --> 42:09.211
Again?

42:09.298 --> 42:12.833
He's spent most of his whole life
in that box, I expect.

42:12.927 --> 42:15.762
"Catzilla"?

42:15.847 --> 42:18.172
The guys who clean up call him that.

42:18.266 --> 42:20.971
But you can call him
anything you want.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.349
I'd say he looks like a "Fluffy."

42:27.233 --> 42:30.602
Ah, poor little Catzilla.

42:31.654 --> 42:35.153
You want a home, don't you?
You wanna get out of here.

42:35.241 --> 42:38.575
Well, you're gonna have
to kill, kill, kill for it.

42:38.661 --> 42:41.413
You're a stupid cat, aren't you?

42:41.497 --> 42:44.866
Yes, you are. And ugly. Extremely.

42:48.838 --> 42:54.592
- Oh! Oh, you little bastard.
- We'll take him.

42:56.596 --> 42:59.763
Here, boy.

43:13.029 --> 43:14.938
Ooh... He's got the scent now.

43:15.031 --> 43:16.940
Yeah, uh, go get 'im, boy.

43:19.577 --> 43:22.115
Oh, easy, easy, easy, easy!

43:30.004 --> 43:33.338
Wow. I almost feel sorry
for the little fella.

43:34.425 --> 43:37.343
Almost!

44:44.245 --> 44:46.487
Don't
worry about that mouse,

44:46.581 --> 44:49.119
start thinking about
how to get $1200.

44:49.208 --> 44:52.209
Don't worry,
the workers will help us.

44:52.295 --> 44:54.833
You see, the truth is...

44:55.923 --> 44:59.374
we don't actually have any money.

45:08.853 --> 45:12.685
We may have to defer
your next paycheque or... or two.

45:12.774 --> 45:16.392
So we can pay the mortgage.

45:16.527 --> 45:18.401
It's the missing LaRue!

45:18.488 --> 45:21.157
There's no need
for violence!

45:23.868 --> 45:27.071
Put that thing down. Whoa!

45:47.058 --> 45:51.270
- Ernie!
- What's the matter?

45:51.354 --> 45:55.268
Well, the, uh, workers...
didn't react very positively.

45:58.236 --> 45:59.730
No?

45:59.821 --> 46:02.027
Uh, what are you doing?

46:02.115 --> 46:05.780
- You could fit through here, right?
- What? I guess so.

46:05.868 --> 46:07.944
Come on.

46:12.667 --> 46:15.419
But, Lars, that was our last resort!

46:15.503 --> 46:18.290
We'll have to
find money someplace else.

46:36.441 --> 46:40.486
Gosh, it's a shame nobody's
interested in buying the factory.

46:40.570 --> 46:44.698
Yeah, yeah, it's a shame.
But who'd be stupid enough, right?

46:44.782 --> 46:47.273
Yeah.

48:31.681 --> 48:35.216
Ah, you must be... Caesar.

48:35.309 --> 48:38.144
I'm glad you could get here
so quickly...

48:38.229 --> 48:40.056
Shh!

49:10.970 --> 49:12.595
You have mice.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.549
He's good.

49:16.642 --> 49:19.429
5120 Nortondale.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.560
January 4th, 0800 hours.

49:21.647 --> 49:24.767
Don't forget to get
toothpaste and Saran Wrap.

49:24.859 --> 49:28.857
We're in sort of a hurry. I wanted
to warn you about this mouse.

49:28.946 --> 49:32.647
Yeah! You got asbestos, all right!

49:32.742 --> 49:35.577
I'll bet it's up
in the ceiling, mostly!

49:36.871 --> 49:41.118
Shouldn't take me more
than a day or two to remove it.

49:44.962 --> 49:49.920
OK, then.
Um, uh, so, we're gonna go upstairs!

49:50.009 --> 49:53.093
All right, well,
we'll all go upstairs!

49:53.179 --> 49:54.590
Yeah.

49:56.557 --> 49:58.965
OK, then. Yeah.

50:03.064 --> 50:04.891
What are you doing?

50:07.110 --> 50:10.230
- He's not listening any more.
- Oh.

50:10.321 --> 50:12.361
Good. Well, you're the expert.

50:12.448 --> 50:15.817
I hope you can take care
of this, whatever it takes.

50:15.910 --> 50:19.077
We've been trying
to catch this menace all week.

50:19.163 --> 50:21.037
Here's your problem.

50:21.124 --> 50:23.366
Normal people are not...

50:23.459 --> 50:26.910
psychologically equipped
to catch mice.

50:27.004 --> 50:30.455
You have to get inside their mind.

50:30.550 --> 50:33.670
You have to know what
they want... need.

50:33.761 --> 50:36.548
You have to think like a mouse.

50:36.639 --> 50:40.174
If you can do that...
if you can think like a mouse...

50:40.268 --> 50:43.139
you can anticipate their moves.

50:43.229 --> 50:47.393
Then, boom! Sayonara, mouse.

50:47.483 --> 50:51.018
Well, you got some great stuff...

50:51.112 --> 50:53.484
Whoa! Never touch that!

50:55.241 --> 50:58.159
- All right!
- What is it?

50:59.287 --> 51:01.327
The big one.

51:01.414 --> 51:04.119
It's a flea bomb!

51:04.208 --> 51:06.497
Works on mice too.

51:07.462 --> 51:11.163
It better. Because we
can't handle any more intrusions.

51:11.257 --> 51:15.006
Sure. That's how you perceive it.

51:15.094 --> 51:17.929
But to that mouse,

51:18.014 --> 51:20.849
you are the intruder.

51:32.570 --> 51:35.571
We can make
enough string to meet our orders.

51:35.656 --> 51:37.565
Just so we can keep the LaRue.

51:37.658 --> 51:40.327
- Good luck.
- Wait! Where are you going?

51:40.411 --> 51:42.285
I have to run a little errand.

51:42.371 --> 51:44.944
All you have to do
is make $1200 worth.

51:45.041 --> 51:47.876
Light a match,
they're frightened by fire!

53:53.836 --> 53:55.710
Unsanitary creature.

53:58.090 --> 54:02.004
Defecating... in the dining room.

54:06.098 --> 54:09.016
0915. Evidence found.

54:12.939 --> 54:16.771
Mus communis. Ugh. Male.

54:21.280 --> 54:26.072
Ten to, uh, twelve
centimetres long,

54:28.204 --> 54:31.288
with a... hmm...

54:33.960 --> 54:36.996
What's this?
A slight calcium deficiency.

54:38.297 --> 54:40.124
That's interesting.

54:47.348 --> 54:50.349
Hi. This is Ernest Smuntz
of Smuntz String.

54:50.435 --> 54:52.926
Is this Zeppco International?

54:53.020 --> 54:56.769
Vinny? Hi, Vinny.
Oh, I'm glad I can call you Vinny.

54:56.858 --> 55:00.559
My brother and I have decided
to reconsider your offer.

55:00.653 --> 55:03.856
I'd love to discuss
selling our factory to you.

55:03.948 --> 55:05.739
Oh, no, not at the office.

55:05.825 --> 55:09.408
How about Ellman Square
under the big clock at noon?

56:34.914 --> 56:39.243
Uh, you, you must be
Mrs Lars Smuntz?

56:39.335 --> 56:42.455
I'm afraid that status
is in transition.

56:42.547 --> 56:47.292
Oh, well, is Lars in? I'd like to
discuss preparations for the auction.

56:47.385 --> 56:49.259
The auction?

57:05.069 --> 57:08.403
Careful, Lars.
You might catch a cold.

57:09.866 --> 57:11.277
April!

57:13.453 --> 57:16.656
You look like you could use
some warming up.

57:23.171 --> 57:27.833
1300 hours. I've activated
the Squeak Seeker 2000.

57:27.925 --> 57:30.297
I'm about to join with the prey.

57:46.736 --> 57:50.603
I'm experiencing malfunction
with the screen. Stand by.

58:01.042 --> 58:02.951
Junk.

58:12.637 --> 58:14.594
Nothing works.

58:51.634 --> 58:53.627
Ah, nuts!

59:39.182 --> 59:43.049
EKG, a C-spine, a chest x-ray
and pelvis. Now move!

59:43.144 --> 59:44.804
$1200...

59:44.896 --> 59:47.102
Mr Smuntz, you've been hit by a bus.

59:47.190 --> 59:49.895
I feel fine. What time is it?

59:49.984 --> 59:52.522
You may have had a concussion.

59:52.612 --> 59:55.946
Doc, I have to get out of here.
I still have a chance.

59:56.032 --> 59:57.989
We saved your hat.

59:58.075 --> 01:00:01.526
- I'm sorry. Are you family?
- Yes, we are sisters.

01:00:01.621 --> 01:00:04.705
There's some paperwork
I need you to fill out.

01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:06.499
I don't even know them!

01:00:06.584 --> 01:00:09.205
Oh, I'm Hilde, and this is Ingrid.

01:00:09.295 --> 01:00:13.542
- We are hair models from Belgium.
- Belgium. How exotic.

01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:18.378
Doc. I need to find a phone before
I miss out on the deal of my life.

01:00:18.471 --> 01:00:21.472
- He's delirious.
- I am not their brother!

01:00:21.557 --> 01:00:25.507
- I don't have any sisters!
- Are you OK? I came when I heard.

01:00:25.603 --> 01:00:28.011
Why are you wearing a pink overcoat?

01:00:29.357 --> 01:00:33.058
Because April gave us the $1200!

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.941
She gave you the money?
She didn't hear about the auction?

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:45.993
I didn't even tell her about the
auction until after she took me back.

01:00:46.082 --> 01:00:51.123
She just showed up at the factory
and begged me to take her.

01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:55.673
We made love in a way
I've only ever seen in nature films.

01:00:55.758 --> 01:00:57.916
Wow. I almost can't believe it.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:02.008
I can open up another restaurant,
you're back with April,

01:01:02.098 --> 01:01:05.348
you can even keep
that worthless factory.

01:01:05.435 --> 01:01:08.602
It's funny
you call the factory worthless,

01:01:08.688 --> 01:01:13.184
because there's something I probably
should have mentioned...

01:01:13.276 --> 01:01:17.190
Yeah? Well, I guess
I have something to confess too.

01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:20.897
Hey, isn't that Caesar's truck?

01:01:33.379 --> 01:01:36.000
- Oh, my God!
- Caesar! What happened?

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:39.459
- Please, he's not well.
- Did you kill the mouse?

01:01:39.552 --> 01:01:42.043
What's that? Horse?

01:01:42.138 --> 01:01:46.052
Fiendish! I won't eat it.

01:01:52.064 --> 01:01:54.057
How'd you find him?

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:58.397
911 call. No voice, but we heard
screaming in the background.

01:01:58.488 --> 01:02:01.026
He was locked in a trunk
in the attic.

01:02:01.115 --> 01:02:03.487
We'll call you if we get any leads.

01:02:25.848 --> 01:02:27.722
What's that?

01:02:30.603 --> 01:02:34.815
'Put that down.
What is that?'

01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:38.600
'That tickles!'

01:02:44.367 --> 01:02:48.032
I don't think we're dealing
with an ordinary mouse.

01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:01.548
My kitchen!

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:12.098
Looks like Caesar decided
to make himself a sandwich.

01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:18.065
Pickles, arugula and capers.

01:03:18.151 --> 01:03:22.279
He toasted the side
with the cheese...

01:03:22.363 --> 01:03:24.439
but not the other side,

01:03:24.532 --> 01:03:27.403
so the arugula doesn't wilt.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.445
How did he know that?

01:03:41.507 --> 01:03:43.381
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.801
Ow!

01:03:52.268 --> 01:03:53.466
Ow!

01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:07.067
Aha!

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.665
- Do you see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:33.554
Lars, I'm stuck!
Get me out of here! I can't breathe!

01:04:33.684 --> 01:04:38.145
- I-I'll get a flashlight.
- Hurry!

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:48.233
- Here, Ernie, I got it.
- I can see that.

01:04:49.367 --> 01:04:51.739
Wh... Oh!

01:04:51.869 --> 01:04:55.819
Hang on, Ernie.
The flashlight's broken.

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:06.300
- OK, Ernie. I got a light.
- Great.

01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:14.425
Lars,
do you smell something?

01:05:16.978 --> 01:05:18.805
Smells like gas.

01:06:43.356 --> 01:06:45.681
What are you gonna do?

01:06:45.775 --> 01:06:48.348
Kill that unspeakable thing.

01:06:48.444 --> 01:06:50.686
- Come on, Ernie...
- Stand back!

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.820
I'm a man on a mission!

01:06:52.949 --> 01:06:56.235
This is how accidents happen!

01:06:56.327 --> 01:07:00.906
- Come on, put the gun down.
- I'll blow his furry head off.

01:07:00.998 --> 01:07:05.707
and splatter his devious mouse brain
from here to kingdom come!

01:07:05.795 --> 01:07:08.333
No, no! You'll blow
a hole in the wall.

01:07:08.422 --> 01:07:10.296
It'll be worth it!

01:07:10.383 --> 01:07:12.791
Think of the auction! For God's sake!

01:07:12.885 --> 01:07:17.512
Think of the money! They'll cut our
price if there's bullet holes.

01:07:17.598 --> 01:07:20.801
- The money?
- Yeah, the money, the moola.

01:07:20.893 --> 01:07:24.938
- There he goes.
- Shoot! Shoot!

01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:33.358
Yes... You hit the piano!
You hit the piano...

01:07:33.448 --> 01:07:35.073
- Look...
- Shh!

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:52.378
What are you, crazy? The only thing
you haven't hit so far is the mouse!

01:07:52.467 --> 01:07:55.468
Give somebody else a chance
with that gun.

01:07:55.553 --> 01:07:58.969
You're doing a wonderful job.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.769
Whoa! You got him!

01:08:13.362 --> 01:08:15.935
G-g-get him!

01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:21.781
See you in hell, mouse!

01:08:24.874 --> 01:08:26.997
Fire!

01:08:53.528 --> 01:08:55.568
God, I hate that mouse!

01:09:03.412 --> 01:09:06.247
'After the beep,
start talking.'

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:11.538
'Mr Smuntz,
this is Vinny from Zeppco calling.

01:09:11.629 --> 01:09:15.578
'We waited in the square for an hour,
but you never showed.

01:09:15.675 --> 01:09:18.877
'We do not appreciate
being treated this way,

01:09:18.970 --> 01:09:23.299
'especially after your brother
already turned down our offer.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.060
'Consider our proposal withdrawn.'

01:09:30.398 --> 01:09:34.395
- Betrayed by my own brother!
- Betrayal?

01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:39.692
Don't talk to me about betrayal. You
should have told me about that offer!

01:09:39.782 --> 01:09:43.910
- Half that factory is mine.
- And half is mi...

01:09:43.995 --> 01:09:48.158
And half is mine, including the half
that you tried to sell.

01:09:48.249 --> 01:09:51.285
And would have,
if it hadn't been for that bus!

01:09:51.377 --> 01:09:57.000
Bus? You can't leave well enough
alone, can you? You ruin everything!

01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:59.878
Me? You... you blame me for this?

01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:02.341
Look! You blew a hole in the floor!

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:06.344
I distinctly remember
somebody yelling, "Shoot!"

01:10:06.434 --> 01:10:09.269
You've never listened to me before!

01:10:09.353 --> 01:10:11.346
- And you know why?
- Why?

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:14.642
Because I have no respect for you!

01:10:14.734 --> 01:10:18.898
Spending your whole life
in that stupid factory!

01:10:18.988 --> 01:10:20.981
It's tragic.

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:25.984
You think I didn't have
ambitions of my own in my life?

01:10:26.078 --> 01:10:29.577
- Come on. You loved string.
- I didn't love string!

01:10:29.665 --> 01:10:34.078
You and Pop were always running
something through your fingers.

01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:36.210
It didn't matter what I did!

01:10:36.297 --> 01:10:39.962
I made a special rack
of lamb for his 70th birthday...

01:10:40.051 --> 01:10:42.803
- Oh, no!
- Yes! You remember.

01:10:42.887 --> 01:10:47.928
I slaved over that meal,
making sure everything was perfect.

01:10:48.017 --> 01:10:52.560
Did he say, "Thanks, Ernie,
it was delicious"? No.

01:10:52.647 --> 01:10:55.767
He only noticed the string
I had tied it with.

01:10:58.653 --> 01:11:00.480
He was crazy!

01:11:01.697 --> 01:11:03.903
But I still wanted his approval.

01:11:03.991 --> 01:11:07.241
I didn't leave, Lars. I was cast out.

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:13.826
There you go again!
Blaming everything else but yourself.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.416
You think you're a success! Huh?

01:11:16.504 --> 01:11:21.000
Well, you... can't... cook!

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.463
- I hate you!
- And I hate you!

01:11:25.555 --> 01:11:27.963
- Not as much as I hate you!
- Yeah?

01:11:28.057 --> 01:11:29.765
Yeah. Double. Double!

01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:33.600
Oh, give me something!
I'm gonna brain you!

01:11:33.729 --> 01:11:35.603
Here it is!

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:38.015
Oh, yeah, give it to me! Go ahead!

01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:45.071
You killed him!

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.608
I-I didn't even know he was there!

01:11:48.744 --> 01:11:53.572
All the trouble we'd have saved
if we'd just thrown fruit at him!

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:56.204
Look! H-He's still breathing!

01:11:56.294 --> 01:11:59.129
Kill him! Kill him!
Find a blunt object!

01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:02.747
There. Let him have it.

01:12:02.842 --> 01:12:05.380
- I-I...
- What are you waiting for?

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:07.878
- I can't just hit him.
- Why not?

01:12:07.972 --> 01:12:10.130
Well, look at him. He's pathetic.

01:12:10.224 --> 01:12:12.632
Pathetic? He's Hitler with a tail.

01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:17.021
This is The Omen with whiskers.
Nostradamus didn't see this.

01:12:17.106 --> 01:12:21.056
- W-well, he's a living thing.
- Not for long. Gimme that!

01:12:25.448 --> 01:12:27.322
I can't!

01:12:27.408 --> 01:12:29.733
God!

01:12:31.287 --> 01:12:33.493
Look at him just lying there.

01:12:33.623 --> 01:12:36.541
It just doesn't feel
very sportsmanlike.

01:12:36.626 --> 01:12:38.868
Do something! He's coming to.

01:12:45.468 --> 01:12:49.003
Ah, I forgot to put holes in the box.

01:13:09.909 --> 01:13:13.325
Hasta la vista,
you little rat bastard!

01:13:14.747 --> 01:13:19.326
- Come on. We got work to do.
- Two days till pay-day, my friend.

01:14:12.221 --> 01:14:16.598
It's the architectural find
of the decade. Oh, let's go...

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.312
- Shall we?
- Yes.

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:35.199
- It wasn't easy, but we made it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:35.286 --> 01:14:39.035
Ernie, I want you
to have something.

01:14:44.712 --> 01:14:46.621
Pop's lucky piece of string.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.928
- I'm glad you kept it.
- He, uh, he wanted us to share it.

01:14:53.012 --> 01:14:54.886
I don't know why, but...

01:14:55.932 --> 01:14:58.340
I think if he were here right now,

01:14:58.434 --> 01:15:00.427
he'd be proud of you.

01:15:02.146 --> 01:15:04.719
I think he'd be proud of us.

01:15:09.654 --> 01:15:14.115
Hello, ladies.
How magnificent! Welcome!

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.403
Lars, you remember Ingrid and Hilde.

01:15:17.495 --> 01:15:19.120
Hello.

01:15:19.205 --> 01:15:22.954
Ladies, your hair
is positively biblical!

01:15:23.042 --> 01:15:25.118
Oh, thank you.

01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:29.624
Well, if you will excuse me,
I have to check on my crepes.

01:15:35.304 --> 01:15:39.883
Keep the champagne coming. The
more they drink, the higher they bid.

01:15:39.976 --> 01:15:42.384
You boys put on quite a shindig here.

01:15:42.478 --> 01:15:44.886
Thank you so much, Mr Falko.

01:15:56.868 --> 01:15:59.952
You know, it would be
very, very sad...

01:16:00.037 --> 01:16:03.453
if you boys put on this auction
and nobody bid.

01:16:03.541 --> 01:16:07.076
That would put a real crimp
in our evening, but...

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:09.210
there's no danger of that.

01:16:09.297 --> 01:16:13.509
I don't know. There's a lot of
Eurotrash scarfin' the shrimps.

01:16:13.593 --> 01:16:15.467
I tell you what.

01:16:15.553 --> 01:16:19.503
You call off the auction... now...

01:16:19.599 --> 01:16:22.470
and I will write you a cheque...

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.434
for ten millions.

01:16:28.274 --> 01:16:31.690
As insanely generous as that is,
I have to decline,

01:16:31.778 --> 01:16:34.814
but I appreciate
your thoughtful concern.

01:16:34.906 --> 01:16:37.231
Enjoy the party.

01:16:37.325 --> 01:16:40.160
Are you interested in spooling?

01:16:40.244 --> 01:16:42.450
Oh, sure. My father...

01:16:42.538 --> 01:16:46.322
I mean, my brother and I
own a string factory.

01:16:46.417 --> 01:16:49.453
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:49.545 --> 01:16:53.210
I would love to see
your factory sometime.

01:16:53.299 --> 01:16:54.674
Really?

01:16:57.178 --> 01:17:01.591
April. What a surprise.
Dropping by for no reason, I suppose?

01:17:01.682 --> 01:17:05.727
Does a wife need a reason?
Oh, are you entertaining?

01:17:05.812 --> 01:17:08.599
- You mean "ex-wife"?
- Not quite yet.

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:14.979
- Ah, hakuna matata.
- This crepe... c'est magnifique.

01:17:15.071 --> 01:17:18.772
- The raisins are a nice touch.
- Good, aren't they?

01:17:20.118 --> 01:17:21.743
Raisins?

01:17:46.644 --> 01:17:49.811
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:52.222
We are about to start the auction.

01:17:54.819 --> 01:17:58.603
I don't know whether to
congratulate you or wish you luck.

01:17:58.698 --> 01:18:00.856
- Wish us luck!
- Hello, April.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.821
- Oh, hello.
- Nice to see you again.

01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:07.612
- I didn't know you knew our lawyer.
- It's just an expression.

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:15.500
Thank you, for joining us
for this momentous occasion

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.499
the auction of our one item,

01:18:18.926 --> 01:18:23.220
the missing LaRue.

01:18:23.306 --> 01:18:27.933
I would like to introduce the owner
of this architectural wonder,

01:18:28.019 --> 01:18:32.064
Mr Ernest Smuntz.

01:18:44.577 --> 01:18:47.661
Thank you, all, for coming.

01:18:47.747 --> 01:18:50.950
When my father left this
extraordinary house

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.667
to my brother Lars...

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:00.467
and myself, uh, we...

01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:04.763
had no idea what surprises
were in store for us or...

01:19:04.847 --> 01:19:07.303
what was going to happen next.

01:19:17.527 --> 01:19:21.026
Uh, when Quincy Thorpe of the, uh...

01:19:21.114 --> 01:19:23.866
Historical Society
told us of its value,

01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:28.570
you, uh... you could have... knocked!

01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:34.206
us over with a feather. We...

01:19:35.336 --> 01:19:39.203
didn't know what... hit us!

01:19:40.341 --> 01:19:44.469
The renovation was exhausting
but ultimately rewarding.

01:19:44.554 --> 01:19:48.682
The house was in terrible disrepair

01:19:48.766 --> 01:19:51.008
but nothing that a few nails...

01:20:02.738 --> 01:20:06.024
and old-fashioned
elbow grease couldn't fix.

01:20:06.117 --> 01:20:10.067
- People are eager to start bidding.
- What? The bidding?

01:20:10.163 --> 01:20:13.366
- The bidding!
- All right. Thank you.

01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:17.787
Thank you, Mr Smuntz.

01:20:19.797 --> 01:20:22.288
No matter what happens, keep going.

01:20:29.682 --> 01:20:34.889
Built in 1876, the last LaRue
in existence has five bedrooms...

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:38.146
- Did you see him? I thought so.
- Yes!

01:20:38.232 --> 01:20:41.019
- He ate the string.
- What?

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.945
The string. Pop's lucky string!

01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:45.939
The son of a bitch ate it!

01:20:46.032 --> 01:20:50.279
- Why didn't you tell me you saw him?
- I didn't, but I found this.

01:20:50.369 --> 01:20:53.405
- You should have weighed him.
- I'm sorry.

01:20:55.792 --> 01:20:58.959
- Did you see where it went?
- It can't go far.

01:20:59.045 --> 01:21:02.496
Well, shall we start
the bidding at $1 million?

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:07.051
Now, we all know we're here
to bid on the missing LaRue.

01:21:07.136 --> 01:21:09.342
Shall we start at $500,000?

01:21:10.932 --> 01:21:13.886
$500,000
from the gentleman from Japan.

01:21:13.976 --> 01:21:18.021
- Now, can I hear a million?
- A million!

01:21:19.315 --> 01:21:23.609
- I'll give you one and a half.
- I have $1.5 million. Two?

01:21:23.694 --> 01:21:26.481
There he is!

01:21:26.572 --> 01:21:31.863
Ladies and gentleman,
all the carpets and tapestries...

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:35.903
- are from Northern Turkey.
- Oh!

01:21:35.998 --> 01:21:40.707
Now, can I have an advance on 1.5?
May I have two?

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:44.460
Can I have two,
ladies and gentlemen?

01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:47.716
- Two million!
- I have $2 million.

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:54.347
I have $2 million, ladies and
gentlemen. Can I have an advance?

01:21:54.434 --> 01:21:57.055
Can I have an advance on $2 million?

01:21:57.145 --> 01:22:01.357
I'd like to draw your attention
to the Lincrusia details...

01:22:01.441 --> 01:22:06.150
of the gold and silver-leafed
copper and pewter.

01:22:06.237 --> 01:22:11.314
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
an advance? An advance on $2 million.

01:22:11.409 --> 01:22:15.621
May I hear $3 million? I have three
from the lady from New York City.

01:22:15.705 --> 01:22:20.201
- What are you doing?
- Uh, uh, uh... nothing!

01:22:20.293 --> 01:22:22.998
Get your hand
out of there immediately!

01:22:26.257 --> 01:22:28.415
Wait! Wait just a minute!

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:32.092
- Wait!
- Now, may I hear $4 million?

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.932
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:36.058 --> 01:22:37.718
Four million.

01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:40.301
- Ooh!
- $4 million from the gentleman.

01:22:40.396 --> 01:22:42.305
I got it!

01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:50.940
Uh, the sheikh bids $5 million.
Thank you, sir. I have $5 million.

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:54.531
$5 million.

01:22:54.619 --> 01:22:58.913
Any advance on $5 million?
Ladies and gentlemen, $5 million.

01:22:58.998 --> 01:23:03.459
An advance? Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the missing LaRue.

01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:06.913
The bidding stands at $5 million.

01:23:07.006 --> 01:23:08.833
I've got you now!

01:23:08.925 --> 01:23:12.508
Hold on tight, I'll get it out.

01:23:12.595 --> 01:23:15.347
Uh, $5 million for the missing LaRue.

01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:18.432
- Have you got it yet?
- I'm not sure.

01:23:18.518 --> 01:23:23.014
Ladies and gentlemen,
will someone give me $6 million?

01:23:23.106 --> 01:23:25.858
- Six million.
- Thank you, sir.

01:23:25.942 --> 01:23:29.276
Hilde, the spool is smoking!

01:23:29.362 --> 01:23:34.238
May I have an advance?
An advance, ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:34.325 --> 01:23:36.531
Can I have an advance on six?

01:23:36.619 --> 01:23:39.324
The bidding stands at $6 million.

01:23:39.413 --> 01:23:42.165
- $7 million.
- $7 million. Thank you.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:45.500
Any advance on seven?

01:23:55.012 --> 01:23:58.630
Keep her away from the walls!
The house is priceless!

01:23:58.724 --> 01:24:01.049
C-c-can I have 7.5?

01:24:03.896 --> 01:24:07.099
I have $8 million over there.

01:24:07.191 --> 01:24:10.525
$8 million going once,
$8 million going twice...

01:24:10.653 --> 01:24:14.022
$8 million?!
You should have taken the cheque!

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:16.867
You shut up! You...

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:20.285
- Ten millions!
- $10 million. Can I have 11?

01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:23.538
$11 million
from the gentleman from Japan.

01:24:23.624 --> 01:24:25.913
12. 13. 14. 15.

01:24:26.002 --> 01:24:27.544
Aha!

01:24:27.628 --> 01:24:30.831
- $16 million from Ernie Smuntz.
- No!

01:24:32.175 --> 01:24:35.176
- 17 million!
- $17 million. Thank you, sir.

01:24:35.261 --> 01:24:37.135
Any advance on 17?

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:49.224
Good idea.

01:24:53.738 --> 01:24:57.522
When I say, turn it on full blast.
We'll flush him out.

01:25:00.036 --> 01:25:01.744
Now!

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:11.787
- $18 million.
- $18 million from the lady.

01:25:11.881 --> 01:25:14.419
You don't have that kind of money.

01:25:18.095 --> 01:25:19.922
- Ernie?
- Not now.

01:25:25.478 --> 01:25:29.558
- 20 millions.
- 20 million. Can I hear 21?

01:25:49.502 --> 01:25:51.874
$21 million from the gentleman.

01:25:56.509 --> 01:26:00.174
- Any advance?
- 22 million. That's my last offer.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:06.468
22 million going once...

01:26:09.605 --> 01:26:13.650
- 25 millions.
- $25 million dollars.

01:26:17.363 --> 01:26:21.147
Thank you, sir. $25 million.

01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:27.528
The bidding stands at $25 million.
Do I have an advance?

01:26:29.375 --> 01:26:32.127
$25 million going once,

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.503
$25 million going twice...

01:27:03.159 --> 01:27:05.033
Going... going...

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.115
Hey! Don't go!

01:27:13.544 --> 01:27:16.747
The water was just a...

01:27:16.839 --> 01:27:19.710
a demonstration of...
of how durable...

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.802
a LaRue really is.

01:27:22.887 --> 01:27:25.129
How about that?

01:27:25.223 --> 01:27:28.806
Now you know this house
will last forever.

01:28:38.254 --> 01:28:42.583
- Pop's lucky string.
- I guess we got him.

01:28:45.136 --> 01:28:47.627
Yeah, I guess we did.

01:30:16.185 --> 01:30:18.094
What was that?

01:30:30.783 --> 01:30:32.941
Lars! Look!

01:31:04.984 --> 01:31:07.142
It's string.

01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:16.284
It's cheese.

01:31:43.147 --> 01:31:48.390
The factory has been retrofitted
to manufacture cheese-based products.

01:31:48.486 --> 01:31:52.733
- I see.
- This is our new lactose-free line.

01:31:52.824 --> 01:31:55.695
- What is that?
- That's quality control.

01:31:57.036 --> 01:31:58.910
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.991
Oh. No good, huh? Otis, more curry.

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.994
OK. Try this one.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:12.801
Huh? It's mozzarella and herring.
You can taste the herring, right?

01:32:12.885 --> 01:32:15.672
I've got an idea
for a caviar-brie swirl
