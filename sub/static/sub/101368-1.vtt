WEBVTT

04:47.972 --> 04:50.107
We found that certain
personality traits

04:50.141 --> 04:51.574
play an important role

04:51.608 --> 04:54.278
in heightened
extrasensory perception.

04:54.311 --> 04:56.047
This list of characteristics

04:56.080 --> 04:57.815
seems to increase
the success rate

04:57.848 --> 04:59.749
in an experiment of this nature.

04:59.784 --> 05:01.718
And what are the
characteristics?

05:01.952 --> 05:04.121
Positive believe in ESP,

05:04.155 --> 05:05.923
practicing a mental discipline

05:05.956 --> 05:09.994
such as meditation
and artistic ability.

05:10.027 --> 05:11.195
And what's the
average success rate

05:11.228 --> 05:12.997
for Ganzfeld experiments?

05:13.030 --> 05:15.866
We have a hit rate
of just over 32%.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.769
The participants have always
been varied in ability.

05:18.803 --> 05:21.372
As Annie said, "Those
who have the compatible

05:21.405 --> 05:23.240
"characteristics
always perform better

05:23.274 --> 05:24.308
"than those who don't."

05:25.776 --> 05:28.079
Dean Michaels, an
unexpected pleasure.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.916
Geez, it's like some kind

05:31.949 --> 05:33.851
of surrealist
nightmare in there.

05:34.218 --> 05:34.919
Poor saps.

05:35.219 --> 05:37.288
They're being
paid for the study.

05:37.321 --> 05:40.657
Oh well, that means
you can torture them

05:40.690 --> 05:41.992
as much as you like.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.726
I'd like to see
you and Dr. Barron

05:43.761 --> 05:46.130
in my office when you're done.

05:46.163 --> 05:46.997
Fine.

05:53.838 --> 05:54.737
What's that?

05:54.772 --> 05:56.240
That has teeth.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.110
The kind of bite I need
to bring more funding in.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.611
Are we struggling?

06:01.812 --> 06:03.948
Let's cut to the chase,

06:03.981 --> 06:07.218
your department budget
is going to be slashed

06:07.251 --> 06:09.120
unless we have more
exciting research

06:09.153 --> 06:10.620
to present to investors.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.124
Is that really true, Dean?

06:13.157 --> 06:15.126
I mean what kind of
scientific research

06:15.159 --> 06:16.659
is exciting to a layman?

06:17.228 --> 06:20.764
The kind that brings
publicity and glamor.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.868
Most of your findings
are derivative research

06:23.901 --> 06:26.203
done in the 70s and 80s,

06:27.138 --> 06:29.874
and that's not in enticing
to people with deep pockets.

06:31.175 --> 06:33.710
<i>This</i> is the sort of thing

06:33.743 --> 06:36.080
your department
should be focused on.

06:43.454 --> 06:44.788
Margam Castle?

06:44.822 --> 06:47.124
Yeah, it's a place in Wales.

06:48.192 --> 06:49.760
You ever heard of Wales before?

06:50.761 --> 06:51.428
Yeah.

06:51.762 --> 06:54.165
Good, because I want
you both to go there,

06:54.198 --> 06:57.234
conduct some experiments,
collect data,

06:57.268 --> 06:59.870
all the stuff you guys live for.

07:01.005 --> 07:01.772
And then what?

07:03.140 --> 07:06.177
We're going to present
your findings to the media,

07:06.210 --> 07:09.013
generate a bit of publicity
for this institution.

07:09.947 --> 07:13.284
It'll be a lot easier
to attract funding

07:13.317 --> 07:15.753
when we have a cause celebre

07:15.786 --> 07:17.955
with the university's
name attached to it.

07:17.988 --> 07:19.223
Are you serious?

07:21.458 --> 07:24.261
Would you rather have
your budget slashed?

07:24.295 --> 07:26.830
Are those the only options?

07:26.864 --> 07:29.732
Look, federal and state
funding is pitiful

07:29.767 --> 07:33.437
for a university of our
size, you know that.

07:33.470 --> 07:37.274
We rely on those extra
dollars from wealthy donors.

07:37.308 --> 07:40.311
Media coverage for
something we're involved in

07:40.344 --> 07:42.880
will pique their interest.

07:42.913 --> 07:43.480
So...

07:45.316 --> 07:46.450
what are we supposed to say

07:46.483 --> 07:48.252
to the media when we get back?

07:48.953 --> 07:51.088
Oh, talk about the
ghosts you've seen.

07:52.256 --> 07:53.257
Of course, it'd be even better

07:53.290 --> 07:55.392
if you captured one on camera.

07:55.426 --> 07:57.294
What if we don't see anything,

07:57.328 --> 07:58.728
are we supposed to lie?

08:00.130 --> 08:03.067
Lying is such a strong word.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.202
Let's call it embellishment.

08:07.271 --> 08:09.773
So even if we don't encounter

08:09.807 --> 08:12.343
anything of a
supernatural nature

08:12.376 --> 08:13.944
you still want us
to come back here

08:13.978 --> 08:15.246
and tell the press we did?

08:17.147 --> 08:18.482
Do you like your job, Holzer?

08:20.317 --> 08:21.385
Yes.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.088
This is a good way to make sure

08:24.121 --> 08:25.756
you still have
one next semester.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.764
Do we understand each other?

08:35.232 --> 08:36.066
I guess.

08:49.146 --> 08:50.180
You know all that stuff

08:50.214 --> 08:53.150
that Michaels fed us back
there is bull, right?

08:53.517 --> 08:54.385
You think?

08:54.753 --> 08:57.154
Yeah, there's
always some ulterior motive

08:57.187 --> 08:58.155
with that guy.

08:58.188 --> 09:00.391
He's probably the one
who wants the publicity,

09:00.424 --> 09:02.159
he loves the limelight.

09:02.192 --> 09:04.194
You've never
seen eye to eye.

09:04.228 --> 09:05.296
I bet he's
getting a kick out of

09:05.329 --> 09:08.332
giving me such a
shitty assignment.

09:08.365 --> 09:10.200
It may not be so bad.

09:10.234 --> 09:11.969
Staying in some dank old castle

09:12.002 --> 09:14.471
in the middle of
nowhere? Please.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.241
I'm all for it.

09:17.274 --> 09:18.575
I got thermal imaging cameras

09:18.609 --> 09:20.277
and electronic voice recorders

09:20.311 --> 09:22.379
I'd love to use in a place
with that much history.

09:22.913 --> 09:25.382
Probably a lot of
residual energy in there.

09:25.416 --> 09:27.818
I think we could get some
interesting readings.

09:29.453 --> 09:32.156
If nothing else it'll be fun
to take the team overseas.

09:32.189 --> 09:33.290
You guys ever been to the UK?

09:34.291 --> 09:35.426
- No.
- Nope.

09:37.361 --> 09:38.429
Do you want to?

09:39.630 --> 09:41.365
- Yeah.
- Why not?

09:41.398 --> 09:42.566
See Annie.

09:42.599 --> 09:44.935
Look if you're not
gonna do it for me

09:44.968 --> 09:45.936
at least do it for the kids.

09:46.236 --> 09:49.406
Michaels didn't give
me much of a choice, did he?

09:49.440 --> 09:50.507
Do they have Wi-Fi in Wales?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.211
You know, Brent, I think
you should be focused

09:54.244 --> 09:55.579
on more important things.

09:55.979 --> 09:57.381
Like what?

09:57.614 --> 10:00.150
You need to look the
part of parapsychologist

10:00.184 --> 10:01.218
when we go over there.

10:01.251 --> 10:04.188
Maybe, get a haircut.

10:05.656 --> 10:07.658
Actually what you
need is a big coat.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.193
Castles are freezing.

10:09.226 --> 10:10.394
Yeah, that's for sure.

13:01.766 --> 13:05.402
Holy crap, this
place is a shit hole.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.805
It's no worse than
some places back home.

13:07.839 --> 13:10.340
Well, I've been
to the UK a few times

13:10.374 --> 13:12.142
and there's one thing
you guys gotta know

13:12.175 --> 13:13.377
about the Brits it's...

13:13.410 --> 13:14.578
They have
fucked up teeth?

13:14.611 --> 13:15.379
Nice.

13:16.014 --> 13:19.249
Well, some do but no.

13:19.283 --> 13:22.619
It's that they are absolutely
obsessed with the weather.

13:22.653 --> 13:26.290
Anytime you talk with a
Brit they'll bring it up.

13:26.323 --> 13:28.659
The sky could be a light
gray or a dark gray

13:28.692 --> 13:30.494
or any sort of gray in between

13:30.527 --> 13:33.196
and they will speculate
about when it's gonna change

13:33.230 --> 13:35.599
like, well like
they're meteorologists.

13:35.632 --> 13:38.101
And then, when the
sun does come out,

13:38.135 --> 13:39.703
it's like it's
the second coming.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.241
We should
grab a bite to eat

13:44.274 --> 13:45.275
before we go to the castle.

13:46.143 --> 13:48.211
Yeah, good
idea, I'm starving.

14:16.607 --> 14:17.407
Let's order.

14:24.681 --> 14:27.284
All right love, what you after?

14:27.317 --> 14:30.888
Some menus would be great.

14:30.922 --> 14:32.422
There you go.

14:41.933 --> 14:44.234
What's Welsh Rarebit?

14:44.267 --> 14:47.437
Oh well, that's a classic
dish around these parts.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.407
It dates back to the
late 18th century.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.878
And it was originally
called Welsh Rabbit.

14:54.112 --> 14:55.679
So it's rabbit then?

14:55.712 --> 14:57.915
No, no there's no rabbit in it.

14:57.949 --> 14:59.784
No.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.685
So why was it
called Welsh Rabbit?

15:02.686 --> 15:03.855
Oh, I don't know.

15:03.888 --> 15:05.589
You know what these
chefs are like,

15:05.622 --> 15:07.691
they give all sorts of fancy
names and stuff, don't they?

15:08.960 --> 15:10.460
What's in it then?

15:10.494 --> 15:13.363
Well, so you got lump of cheese.

15:13.397 --> 15:17.634
You got eggs, milk, pinch
of salt, pinch of pepper,

15:17.668 --> 15:20.504
you blend it all together,
chuck it on some bread,

15:20.537 --> 15:24.776
stick it in the oven,
bake it, cheese is melted

15:24.809 --> 15:27.444
and you can do a variety
of things with it too.

15:27.477 --> 15:29.546
Put a fried egg on it

15:29.579 --> 15:31.214
and then it becomes
a buck rabbit.

15:31.248 --> 15:35.787
Or, better still, you can
stick a tomato with it

15:35.820 --> 15:37.721
and it becomes a Blushing Bunny.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.658
It's funny name, isn't it.

15:41.692 --> 15:43.694
But I'll level
with you here love,

15:45.462 --> 15:49.332
it's really posh cheese
on toast, all right?

15:50.734 --> 15:51.969
I'm sold, I'll
have one of those.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.705
That is the only thing I
understand on the menu,

15:54.738 --> 15:55.807
so me too.

15:57.975 --> 15:59.643
Why not, I'll have
one of those too.

16:00.011 --> 16:01.378
Another one here.

16:06.616 --> 16:08.685
Well, looks like Welsh
Rarebit for all of us.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.520
Good choice. Hey!

16:11.254 --> 16:14.591
Idris, make that
five Welsh Rarebits!

16:14.624 --> 16:15.927
No need to shout.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.561
I'll do it now in a minute.

16:23.633 --> 16:24.802
So where you lot from then?

16:25.502 --> 16:27.972
New York.

16:28.005 --> 16:28.873
America, eh?

16:31.374 --> 16:32.743
I never been there myself

16:32.777 --> 16:34.812
but I've heard it's all right.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.580
Yeah, we like it.

16:39.817 --> 16:40.684
So what do you do?

16:40.717 --> 16:41.886
What are you doing here?

16:42.352 --> 16:43.955
We're parapsychologists.

16:44.856 --> 16:45.790
Headshrinkers, is it?

16:47.424 --> 16:49.994
No, we study
paranormal phenomenon.

16:50.027 --> 16:52.329
We're spending the
night at Margam Castle.

16:53.998 --> 16:54.731
Oh no.

16:57.101 --> 16:59.569
No, you don't wanna go up there.

17:02.006 --> 17:03.473
Really, why?

17:06.376 --> 17:07.711
Many say it's cursed.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.786
Well, a lot of
places have a legend.

17:15.987 --> 17:16.788
Oh no.

17:17.989 --> 17:19.422
No.

17:20.624 --> 17:21.959
This is more than a legend.

17:37.607 --> 17:40.644
If you had any sense
you'd turn back.

17:40.677 --> 17:42.512
Stay away from the castle.

17:43.713 --> 17:44.748
Oh Jesus, you too.

17:45.448 --> 17:47.417
They've laid dormant
for many years

17:47.450 --> 17:49.987
but now they are awakening.

17:51.688 --> 17:53.991
Yeah, okay, thanks a lot.

17:54.025 --> 17:54.959
Who are "they"?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.130
They're waiting for you.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.431
They've always been waiting.

19:13.771 --> 19:15.873
Which one of you is in charge?

19:15.907 --> 19:16.740
I am.

19:18.075 --> 19:18.910
Right.

19:19.542 --> 19:22.980
My name is Enos,
I'm the caretaker.

19:23.014 --> 19:23.881
I'm Annie Holzer.

19:23.915 --> 19:25.149
Good to meet you.

19:25.182 --> 19:27.517
Hi, Dr. Daniel Barron.

19:28.652 --> 19:30.121
Doctor?

19:30.154 --> 19:32.924
What's a doctor want to
spend the night here for?

19:32.957 --> 19:36.060
Oh no, I'm not a medical doctor.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.627
I got a minor in parapsychology

19:37.661 --> 19:38.963
while earning a
bachelor's degree

19:38.996 --> 19:41.766
in psychology at
Franklin Pierce.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.167
We're just here to
do some research.

19:43.768 --> 19:45.669
What are you researching?

19:45.702 --> 19:47.004
We're investigating claims

19:47.038 --> 19:49.040
of paranormal sightings
in the building.

19:49.472 --> 19:51.943
There's been plenty of
those down the years.

19:55.947 --> 19:57.747
Hey, do you get any
phone signal around here?

19:58.215 --> 19:58.950
No.

19:59.984 --> 20:01.752
No Wi-Fi either, I guess.

20:01.953 --> 20:03.020
Nothing like that.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.322
How come?

20:04.587 --> 20:07.590
Well, there are no
phone masts for miles.

20:08.359 --> 20:11.996
Locals don't like
to get too close.

20:12.029 --> 20:15.099
Yeah, we met a few
of them earlier.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.001
They were bit twitchy
about this place.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.003
With good reason.

20:35.685 --> 20:37.989
I'll be
back in the morning.

20:38.022 --> 20:38.923
All the best to you.

20:38.956 --> 20:40.958
You're not
gonna give us the tour?

20:41.993 --> 20:45.796
Oh, I'm sure you can
find your own way around.

20:50.101 --> 20:51.969
He didn't wanna stay too long.

20:52.003 --> 20:55.973
Yeah, this place sure
does spook everyone.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.126
Holy shit.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.932
It's like something
out of Dracula movie.

21:21.966 --> 21:24.068
Pretty creepy, right?

21:24.101 --> 21:27.838
Speaking of which what's
with the new fatigues?

21:27.872 --> 21:31.008
Oh, Annie said, "I
should look the part."

21:31.876 --> 21:33.244
Yeah, but the waistcoat?

21:33.277 --> 21:36.213
Dude, she wanted you to
look like a parapsychologist

21:36.247 --> 21:37.214
not fuckin' Aladdin.

21:38.082 --> 21:39.216
Too much?

21:39.250 --> 21:40.550
Just a little.

21:41.519 --> 21:43.187
But the haircut's
good though, right?

21:44.021 --> 21:46.589
Sure, if you came here
to sell insurance.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.027
You know, you're mean
when you're sober.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.963
Well, speaking of which.

21:52.997 --> 21:53.764
Is that weed?

21:54.298 --> 21:56.333
Keep your voice down.

21:56.367 --> 21:57.201
Where'd you get it?

21:57.234 --> 21:58.035
I have my sources.

21:58.969 --> 22:01.205
How the hell did you
get it on the plane?

22:01.405 --> 22:04.108
You really
don't wanna know that.

22:08.112 --> 22:09.346
- Oh, sorry.
- Kirk, yeah.

22:09.380 --> 22:10.781
Yeah.

22:10.815 --> 22:13.150
Kirk, sorry
forgot about you dude.

22:16.719 --> 22:17.321
Hello.

22:19.123 --> 22:19.857
Mr. Morgan?

22:20.191 --> 22:23.360
Yes, no please, come
on, call me Hugh, please.

22:23.394 --> 22:25.830
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

22:25.863 --> 22:27.064
Dr. Daniel Barron.

22:27.098 --> 22:29.200
It's great to put
a face to the name.

22:30.334 --> 22:31.936
This is my colleague

22:31.969 --> 22:33.736
and leader of our research
team, Annie Holzer.

22:33.771 --> 22:36.407
- Annie, how nice to see.
- Good to meet you.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.342
As you can see I
brought somebody with me

22:38.375 --> 22:41.178
I'd like to introduce
you to, Edith Withers.

22:41.212 --> 22:44.014
She's a very well-know
psychic medium.

22:44.048 --> 22:45.282
Fabulous to meet you.

22:45.316 --> 22:46.417
Likewise.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.152
Hi.

22:48.185 --> 22:50.687
So, what do you feel you can
contribute to our research?

22:51.222 --> 22:52.890
Well, I understand your studies

22:52.923 --> 22:55.192
are of the paranormal variety.

22:55.226 --> 22:56.260
That's right.

22:56.293 --> 22:57.962
Perhaps someone who communicates

22:57.995 --> 22:59.263
with the world of the spirit

22:59.296 --> 23:02.099
could be a worthwhile resource.

23:02.133 --> 23:04.902
That's not usually how
we collect our data.

23:06.103 --> 23:08.139
I understand that.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.908
But a different perspective
could be useful.

23:16.213 --> 23:18.449
Okay, let's give it a try.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.184
Oh, thank you.

23:20.217 --> 23:23.154
I've always been
fascinated by this castle.

23:23.187 --> 23:26.157
I hear it has remarkable
residual energy.

23:27.992 --> 23:29.692
What is your objective here,

23:29.726 --> 23:32.062
I mean if you don't
mind me asking you?

23:32.096 --> 23:33.797
Well, like I said on the phone

23:33.831 --> 23:35.199
we're a parapsychology team

23:35.232 --> 23:38.735
just looking to study
and collect data.

23:38.769 --> 23:40.271
I was sort of wondering
whether or not

23:40.304 --> 23:44.341
you had some kind of
specific hypothesis

23:44.375 --> 23:45.409
that you were going to prove?

23:45.442 --> 23:46.810
Nothing specific.

23:46.844 --> 23:48.312
We're open-minded
about the conclusion.

23:48.345 --> 23:49.547
Oh good, I'm so pleased to hear

23:49.580 --> 23:54.752
because you know a lot of people
sort of over-sensationalize

23:54.785 --> 23:56.120
about it, all right?

23:57.354 --> 23:58.189
Shall we
took a look around?

23:58.222 --> 23:59.722
Yeah, that'd be great.

24:44.101 --> 24:46.070
Camera on the north
side corridor is down.

24:46.103 --> 24:47.238
Who hooked that one up?

24:48.372 --> 24:49.306
Aw, shit.

24:50.441 --> 24:52.042
Nice job.

24:52.076 --> 24:53.844
Do you want me to
go check it out?

24:53.877 --> 24:55.546
Don't bother, I'll do it.

24:55.579 --> 24:57.481
Just stay here and
watch the monitors.

25:02.119 --> 25:03.287
Apple polisher.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.421
What?

25:04.455 --> 25:05.356
Well, you jumped right in there

25:05.389 --> 25:07.258
offering to fix my mistake.

25:07.291 --> 25:08.359
What a kiss ass.

25:08.392 --> 25:09.293
Oh bite me.

25:14.932 --> 25:16.233
Forgive my ignorance, Edith

25:16.267 --> 25:20.037
but what is it exactly you do?

25:21.005 --> 25:24.141
I mean I've seen mediums
in movies and things

25:24.174 --> 25:27.278
but I'm guessing
there's more to it.

25:27.311 --> 25:30.447
I act as intermediary between
the world of the living

25:30.481 --> 25:32.182
and the world of spirit.

25:33.117 --> 25:37.521
Right, but are there different
categories of mediumship?

25:39.423 --> 25:42.526
There are usually two
types of mediumship,

25:42.559 --> 25:44.428
mental and physical.

25:45.129 --> 25:48.265
So what kind of medium are you?

25:48.299 --> 25:51.201
I specialize in the
mental side of mediumship.

25:52.336 --> 25:54.338
I walk through a house

25:54.371 --> 25:57.975
and I tune into the residual
energy that's there.

25:58.008 --> 25:59.543
So have you ever been involved

25:59.576 --> 26:01.945
in a investigation
like this before?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.882
10 years ago I was invited

26:04.915 --> 26:07.017
to join a team of ghost hunters

26:07.051 --> 26:09.887
who were investigating
Pendle Hill.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.388
That's where the famous trials

26:11.422 --> 26:15.025
of the Pendle witches
were held in 1612.

26:15.059 --> 26:16.960
Have you ever heard of them?

26:16.994 --> 26:18.162
- No.
- No.

26:18.195 --> 26:21.498
They were the most famous witch
trials in British history.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.502
10 women were
accused and executed

26:25.536 --> 26:28.939
by Matthew Hopkins, the
Witchfinder General.

26:28.972 --> 26:33.977
I found being in Pendle Hill
a most disturbing experience.

26:34.978 --> 26:36.313
Why's that?

26:36.680 --> 26:41.318
When I connected I
realized that the women

26:41.352 --> 26:44.188
weren't practicing
dark witchcraft at all.

26:45.189 --> 26:46.990
They were simply women like me

26:47.024 --> 26:50.427
who were practicing
their skills.

26:51.562 --> 26:53.330
That's what I found
so disturbing.

26:55.599 --> 26:57.401
Had I'd lived in the 1600s,

26:57.434 --> 26:59.536
perhaps I'd have been
burned at the stake.

27:01.505 --> 27:05.342
Have you had any prior
experience in this castle?

27:06.377 --> 27:10.080
I've never been invited to
any events or studies here.

27:10.114 --> 27:14.017
I think the locals would rather
leave this place well alone.

27:15.185 --> 27:17.521
When was the castle
first built, Hugh?

27:17.554 --> 27:20.424
The Talbot family constructed it

27:20.457 --> 27:24.962
over a 10-year period
from 1830 to 1840.

27:24.995 --> 27:28.565
A young man, the Talbot
patriarch, Christopher,

27:28.599 --> 27:31.468
he traveled across
Europe for years

27:31.502 --> 27:34.438
and he returned to
South Wales in 1830.

27:34.471 --> 27:36.473
And he was the one who

27:36.507 --> 27:39.276
redeveloped the
whole family estate.

27:39.309 --> 27:42.346
When was the first report of
supernatural activity here?

27:42.379 --> 27:44.348
Well the whole Talbot family

27:44.381 --> 27:47.184
they lived here until 1941

27:47.217 --> 27:51.021
and then they sold it
to David Evans-Bevan,

27:51.054 --> 27:52.623
good Welsh name.

27:52.656 --> 27:54.558
Anyway he sold it
soon afterwards.

27:54.591 --> 27:57.494
He said, that it was, you know,
too big for what he wanted.

27:57.528 --> 28:02.099
But his relatives said, that
the real reason he sold it

28:02.132 --> 28:05.302
was because he was you
know, very, very disturbed

28:05.335 --> 28:09.406
by all the noises he
heard every evening.

28:10.107 --> 28:13.477
Like children running up
and down the corridors.

28:13.510 --> 28:16.280
And David's son said,
he saw a little girl

28:16.313 --> 28:18.449
darting in and out of rooms

28:18.482 --> 28:21.618
and she was always
wearing Victorian dress.

28:23.086 --> 28:24.688
So are we to assume

28:24.721 --> 28:27.157
that children died
here during that era?

28:28.525 --> 28:31.528
Yes, I think that's
safe to assume.

31:25.736 --> 31:28.940
Hey, do you want me to get
you an aspirin or something?

31:28.973 --> 31:29.807
Why?

31:31.241 --> 31:34.779
I'm fine.

31:36.713 --> 31:39.851
I can't believe we didn't
put a camera in that room.

31:39.884 --> 31:41.451
We have one in there now.

31:46.824 --> 31:49.559
I sense a lot of
consternation from a child

31:49.593 --> 31:53.363
who lived in this
castle, a little girl.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.734
She lived mainly in one room.

32:00.404 --> 32:02.506
It was a room filled with toys.

32:03.507 --> 32:07.277
But, for her, it was a room
filled with loneliness.

32:08.846 --> 32:10.647
What era are we talking about?

32:12.884 --> 32:15.953
18, 1871.

32:18.722 --> 32:19.723
What was her name?

32:21.291 --> 32:22.192
Abigail.

32:24.896 --> 32:27.698
Did she,
did she die there?

32:28.966 --> 32:32.703
Yes, in that room.

32:35.305 --> 32:36.473
What?

32:36.506 --> 32:37.340
What happened?

33:10.607 --> 33:11.374
It's over Catherine!

33:11.408 --> 33:12.676
I want you out of here!

33:12.709 --> 33:13.778
Don't say that please!

33:13.811 --> 33:15.445
I mean it I have had enough!

33:15.479 --> 33:16.379
Just get out!

33:17.347 --> 33:18.916
I'm taking Abigail with me.

33:18.950 --> 33:19.984
No you're not.

33:20.017 --> 33:22.319
She's staying here with me.

33:22.352 --> 33:23.720
No!

33:23.755 --> 33:24.889
She's not!

33:24.922 --> 33:26.858
This is your final warning.

33:26.891 --> 33:28.658
If you're still
here when I get back

33:28.692 --> 33:30.427
there'll be hell to pay!

33:31.796 --> 33:32.596
Just get out!

36:56.867 --> 36:59.569
The members of the family
covered up their deaths.

37:00.972 --> 37:03.573
A murder-suicide would
have brought public shame.

37:06.110 --> 37:09.479
The bride and the child
are buried on the property.

37:11.681 --> 37:15.052
Their tormented souls
trapped within the walls.

37:24.929 --> 37:25.930
I'm going to the bathroom.

37:27.164 --> 37:28.265
Have fun.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.110
- You sure your okay?
- I said I'm fine!

37:40.845 --> 37:42.512
All right, just asking.

37:44.915 --> 37:45.816
I'm sorry.

37:47.952 --> 37:49.586
It was just creepy.

37:51.155 --> 37:54.025
That's the first time I've
seen an apparition in person.

37:54.925 --> 37:55.760
Really?

37:57.795 --> 38:00.064
We don't do much
fieldwork like this.

38:01.598 --> 38:04.001
I mean I've been to
haunted sites before but...

38:05.970 --> 38:09.206
never one with such tangible
supernatural energy.

38:10.374 --> 38:13.576
Well yeah, it's always scary
seeing something that's...

38:13.610 --> 38:15.745
- Well, it's not just that...
- ...not supposed to be there.

38:17.915 --> 38:20.885
It's said that when the
ghost of a deceased person

38:20.918 --> 38:24.721
appears to someone the ghost
retains the personality

38:24.755 --> 38:26.157
from when the person was living.

38:28.259 --> 38:30.928
And it's said most of the
time that communication

38:30.961 --> 38:35.766
is of a peaceful nature
but I didn't feel that.

38:38.202 --> 38:39.970
All I felt was anger,

38:41.105 --> 38:42.106
bitterness,

38:43.174 --> 38:44.641
injustice.

38:46.676 --> 38:48.112
And that's what scared me.

38:50.281 --> 38:53.350
I thought that when we
died we'd be at peace

38:54.885 --> 38:58.588
and now I know that
if we don't die happy

39:00.124 --> 39:03.060
we're stuck with that
anger for eternity.

39:06.696 --> 39:08.032
And that's hell.

40:05.322 --> 40:06.223
Kirk?

40:08.926 --> 40:10.794
Lydia.

40:11.795 --> 40:13.297
Brent, is that you?

40:32.116 --> 40:35.452
Hey, were you guys watching
the corridor on the south side?

40:35.486 --> 40:36.820
No.

40:36.854 --> 40:38.222
Okay, but you're
recording though, right?

40:38.255 --> 40:38.989
Yeah.

40:39.523 --> 40:41.192
Good, I need you to wind it back
and check something for me.

40:41.225 --> 40:42.059
What happened?

40:43.194 --> 40:44.828
Writing appeared
in the bathroom.

40:45.396 --> 40:46.430
Was it your mom's phone number?

40:46.463 --> 40:48.866
- I'm not kidding around, Brent.
- Ow!

40:48.899 --> 40:50.301
A message appeared
in the mirror.

40:50.334 --> 40:51.734
What did it say?

40:52.436 --> 40:54.471
It said to get out.

40:54.972 --> 40:57.041
We don't have a camera
in the bathroom.

40:57.341 --> 40:59.410
I know that but when I came out

40:59.443 --> 41:03.814
into the hallway I saw a figure.

41:03.847 --> 41:04.915
All right, I'll check it out.

41:04.949 --> 41:06.350
Okay, thanks.

41:06.383 --> 41:07.518
It's freaky isn't it?

41:07.551 --> 41:09.153
Seeing something like that.

41:09.186 --> 41:09.719
Yeah.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.755
It makes you think
you're going crazy.

41:12.323 --> 41:13.123
Yeah, I guess.

41:14.158 --> 41:15.125
That's strange.

41:16.260 --> 41:17.428
What?

41:17.461 --> 41:19.063
Look at the monitor.

41:19.396 --> 41:20.231
That's playback.

41:21.398 --> 41:22.499
What?

41:59.370 --> 42:01.305
I don't doubt you
both saw apparitions.

42:01.338 --> 42:02.206
It's just frustrating

42:02.239 --> 42:04.541
our cameras haven't
captured anything.

42:04.575 --> 42:06.877
I checked the heat sensors,

42:06.910 --> 42:08.112
they detected a sudden drop

42:08.145 --> 42:10.414
in temperature during
both sightings.

42:10.447 --> 42:11.882
That's
something at least.

42:12.383 --> 42:13.951
I get the impression

42:13.984 --> 42:16.220
that won't be our last
encounter tonight anyway.

42:17.621 --> 42:19.490
Of course, you know
you haven't come across

42:19.523 --> 42:22.259
the most famous
ghost in the castle

42:22.293 --> 42:24.995
a man called Robert Scott.

42:25.029 --> 42:28.032
He was a gamekeeper
way back in 1898.

42:28.065 --> 42:29.266
Why is he the most famous?

42:48.986 --> 42:49.987
You!

42:51.522 --> 42:53.957
You are not allowed
on this land!

43:55.519 --> 43:57.688
Robert Scott was
not a forgiving man in life

43:57.721 --> 44:00.391
and nothing has
changed in his death.

44:00.424 --> 44:02.393
He's a bitter and
vengeful entity

44:02.426 --> 44:05.429
who will punish anyone
who invades his territory.

44:05.462 --> 44:08.999
You know the big staircase
by the entrance hall?

44:09.032 --> 44:10.200
That's where he's seen.

44:10.234 --> 44:11.301
He's, you know he's
carrying the axe

44:11.335 --> 44:13.303
and his face is blah.

44:14.371 --> 44:17.541
Some spirits choose to reveal
themselves to the living

44:17.574 --> 44:19.410
in the way they died.

44:19.443 --> 44:21.645
That's why Scott
still bears the scars

44:21.678 --> 44:23.480
of that fateful battle.

44:27.985 --> 44:29.620
I'm going for a walk.

44:29.653 --> 44:31.155
I need some fresh air.

44:32.356 --> 44:33.290
I'll go with you.

44:47.271 --> 44:50.040
Edith, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

44:50.073 --> 44:50.707
Yes?

44:52.476 --> 44:56.313
I'd always believed
that when we passed over

44:56.346 --> 44:59.183
that the pain of life
would be washed away.

45:00.250 --> 45:02.553
That we would genuinely
rest in peace.

45:03.253 --> 45:05.122
Sounds like that's not the case.

45:08.492 --> 45:10.127
No, not for everyone.

45:11.528 --> 45:14.298
But that's a scary
idea isn't it?

45:14.331 --> 45:19.069
That even in death the anger
of life may stay with us.

45:19.102 --> 45:21.004
There are many different
beliefs out there

45:21.038 --> 45:23.407
but most cultures agree

45:23.440 --> 45:25.709
that the reason that
ghosts remain behind

45:25.742 --> 45:27.578
is unfinished business.

45:28.612 --> 45:31.682
Whether it's avenging a
murder or some other desire.

46:13.590 --> 46:15.760
You seemed a little
agitated back there.

46:15.793 --> 46:20.297
Running around a castle with
some psychic chasing ghosts?

46:20.330 --> 46:22.699
Seems like something a
reality TV crew would do

46:22.733 --> 46:25.502
more than a team of
educated parapsychologists.

46:26.804 --> 46:28.272
You know, I can't
help but feeling

46:28.305 --> 46:29.706
that a lot of what
we're experiencing

46:29.740 --> 46:31.675
could be power of suggestion.

46:33.410 --> 46:35.679
What about all the
monitors cutting out?

46:35.712 --> 46:38.181
That was probably just
Brent and Kirk screwing up.

46:41.184 --> 46:41.718
Hey.

46:43.755 --> 46:46.223
What inspired you to
become a parapsychologist?

46:46.723 --> 46:49.761
Why are you
asking me that now?

46:50.795 --> 46:51.628
I'm nosy.

46:54.164 --> 46:56.233
It was so long ago,
I don't remember.

46:57.434 --> 46:58.268
Really?

47:00.170 --> 47:05.108
Well, maybe I don't feel
comfortable sharing.

47:08.745 --> 47:10.113
In all our years
working together

47:10.147 --> 47:13.317
have I ever given you any reason

47:13.350 --> 47:14.786
to believe that
I'm not a good guy?

47:18.722 --> 47:20.557
I guess not but...

47:23.160 --> 47:24.628
this is not the happiest story.

47:26.663 --> 47:27.497
I can take it.

47:33.570 --> 47:36.673
I never had a very good
relationship with my parents.

47:38.275 --> 47:41.813
It was my brother Kenny who
was always there for me,

47:41.846 --> 47:45.716
giving me advice, protecting me,

47:45.749 --> 47:49.252
showing me the love that
our parents never did.

47:52.689 --> 47:54.691
One day, when we were
teenagers, he was getting ready

47:54.725 --> 47:58.362
to go on road trip to
Mexico with his friends.

47:59.596 --> 48:01.766
I had this terrible feeling.

48:01.799 --> 48:03.233
Before he left...

48:05.736 --> 48:08.271
...he told me, he'd
always be there for me.

48:09.807 --> 48:11.375
The next day we got the call.

48:13.644 --> 48:14.711
There had been a car crash.

48:14.745 --> 48:16.680
Kenny and his
friends were killed.

48:17.614 --> 48:20.651
I had to go to the coroner's
and identify the body.

48:20.684 --> 48:23.788
My parents wouldn't go.

48:26.758 --> 48:29.761
I wish the last
memory I had of him

48:29.794 --> 48:31.796
was while he was
still alive, but...

48:33.865 --> 48:35.699
seeing him at
the mortuary...

48:37.267 --> 48:39.837
it often, it flashes
through my mind a lot.

48:42.974 --> 48:45.542
Cold and lifeless, he looked.

48:47.744 --> 48:48.712
Haunts me.

48:51.348 --> 48:52.282
Jesus.

48:53.918 --> 48:54.752
That's terrible.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.189
I still miss him so much.

49:01.591 --> 49:02.927
He was everything to me.

49:07.597 --> 49:09.867
That's why I took an
interest in parapsychology.

49:09.901 --> 49:14.371
I thought that it would make
me less scared of dying.

49:15.439 --> 49:17.374
Sounds silly, I know.

49:17.407 --> 49:18.876
No, not at all.

49:21.378 --> 49:23.714
It's hard for me to
get close to someone.

49:26.616 --> 49:27.384
Well...

49:29.887 --> 49:32.723
if you're meant
to get close to someone

49:32.757 --> 49:37.762
the link just kinda
happens, organically.

49:40.330 --> 49:42.867
You know the, universe,

49:42.900 --> 49:45.669
has a funny way

49:45.702 --> 49:46.804
of working these things out.

49:53.044 --> 49:54.812
We should get back.

49:56.580 --> 49:57.414
Yeah.

53:25.957 --> 53:26.958
Jesus!

53:26.991 --> 53:28.826
We need to call someone!

53:28.859 --> 53:30.761
There's no signal here.

53:31.862 --> 53:34.131
Someone has to drive
into town and get help!

53:39.103 --> 53:39.971
What the fuck?

53:44.909 --> 53:46.710
They won't let us leave.

53:54.952 --> 53:56.921
Where's Lydia?

53:56.954 --> 53:58.022
I haven't seen her.

53:59.190 --> 54:00.257
Is she still outside?

54:01.926 --> 54:03.127
Maybe she'll go back to town

54:03.160 --> 54:04.795
when she realizes
we're locked in.

54:50.908 --> 54:52.209
These big places always

54:52.243 --> 54:54.278
have hidden compartments
and passages.

54:54.311 --> 54:56.247
Maybe they'll lead
us to a secret exit.

54:57.747 --> 54:58.648
Have you ever heard of anything

54:58.681 --> 54:59.616
like that in this place, Hugh?

54:59.649 --> 55:01.986
Yeah, well actually
there was an employee

55:02.019 --> 55:03.254
who worked here for
many, many years,

55:03.287 --> 55:05.923
now he claimed that
there was a secret vault

55:05.956 --> 55:07.124
down in the grounds there

55:07.158 --> 55:10.327
and it contains some of the
castles historic artifacts.

55:10.361 --> 55:13.330
And he also said,
that from the vault

55:13.364 --> 55:16.633
there was another tunnel
leading to the outside.

55:16.666 --> 55:18.235
It was constructed
in case the Talbot's

55:18.269 --> 55:21.272
ever had to you know get out
of the castle undetected.

55:21.505 --> 55:24.008
I don't see anything like
that on the blueprints.

55:24.041 --> 55:25.608
Yeah, I know it was supposed
to be secret, wasn't it?

55:25.976 --> 55:26.811
Well, if it's such a secret

55:26.844 --> 55:28.946
how come that employee
knew about it?

55:28.979 --> 55:31.048
Sound very logical to me
when he told me any way.

55:31.082 --> 55:34.952
All right, our only option
is search this castle.

55:34.985 --> 55:36.987
Find out if there
really is a secret door

55:37.021 --> 55:38.189
that leads to a vault.

55:38.222 --> 55:39.622
We have no proof
there's even a vault

55:39.656 --> 55:41.892
let alone an escape
route inside it.

55:41.926 --> 55:44.261
It's not in the blueprints
it's just hearsay.

55:44.295 --> 55:46.097
What other choice do we have?

55:46.130 --> 55:47.264
All we've got up here

55:47.298 --> 55:49.366
are bars on the windows
and locked doors.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.802
We tried to break them
down they won't budge.

55:51.836 --> 55:53.871
I believe there is a vault.

55:53.904 --> 55:55.406
But I must warn you
that the spirits

55:55.439 --> 55:58.242
will do everything they
can to stop us finding it.

56:01.245 --> 56:02.046
Shit!

56:03.447 --> 56:05.349
Is it just this
room or the whole building?

56:07.384 --> 56:09.987
All the lights are
off out here too.

56:10.020 --> 56:11.621
I think the whole
building's down.

56:12.022 --> 56:13.424
Did you pack the flashlights?

56:13.457 --> 56:15.292
Yeah, they're in
a bag over there.

56:26.370 --> 56:28.072
- Hugh.
- Thank you.

56:29.173 --> 56:30.174
We'll search the rooms,

56:30.207 --> 56:32.409
find this secret
passage if we can.

56:33.410 --> 56:35.980
You stay here, keep an
eye on the equipment.

56:36.614 --> 56:38.249
I haven't heard Lydia knocking.

56:40.951 --> 56:42.319
Do you think she still outside?

56:45.990 --> 56:47.224
I don't know.

56:47.258 --> 56:48.359
Maybe she went back
to town to get help.

56:48.392 --> 56:50.027
That's what we're hoping for.

57:06.844 --> 57:09.046
Okay, let's search.

57:09.079 --> 57:10.447
Daniel and I will
take that room,

57:10.481 --> 57:12.183
Hugh and Edith, you
take the one opposite.

57:12.216 --> 57:13.384
Anyone finds anything,

57:13.417 --> 57:15.986
come back to the
corridor and call out.

57:16.020 --> 57:17.221
- All right, fine.
- And leave the doors open

57:17.254 --> 57:18.756
so we can hear each other, okay.

57:18.789 --> 57:21.358
- Yeah, okay fine.
- Yes, yes, yes.

57:38.008 --> 57:39.910
I didn't see this room earlier.

57:42.112 --> 57:43.047
Yeah, me neither.

57:45.316 --> 57:49.320
There's something really
familiar about this place.

57:51.789 --> 57:53.490
I feel like I've
been here before.

58:21.118 --> 58:21.952
Wait.

59:00.491 --> 59:02.826
Where on earth are we?

59:06.397 --> 59:07.965
Pendle Hill.

59:07.998 --> 59:10.267
It's the castle toying with us.

59:10.301 --> 59:11.869
Playing on our fears.

59:11.902 --> 59:13.504
Bringing the past
into the present.

59:28.452 --> 59:30.587
Edith Withers.

59:30.621 --> 59:31.355
Yes.

59:32.289 --> 59:35.125
The mark of Satan is upon you.

59:36.393 --> 59:37.261
You

59:37.494 --> 59:38.595
must

59:39.463 --> 59:40.431
burn.

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:07.257
Who is that?

01:00:09.526 --> 01:00:11.195
It's my brother.

01:00:55.639 --> 01:01:00.611
Your Satanic ways are an
affront to common decency

01:01:02.479 --> 01:01:07.084
and it is just that
you suffer for them.

01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:39.483
Stern.

01:01:42.719 --> 01:01:45.456
Do your duty.

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.409
What the hell happened?

01:02:39.443 --> 01:02:41.645
Psychological warfare.

01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:44.448
The castle using our
fears against us.

01:02:48.685 --> 01:02:49.586
Was that Kirk?

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.555
Shh.

01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:45.242
No!

01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:48.545
She's gone, Hugh!

01:03:49.546 --> 01:03:50.714
Come on, come on!

01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:15.572
Look!

01:04:17.674 --> 01:04:18.508
Help me!

01:04:22.713 --> 01:04:23.747
Come on!

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:01.218
Annie.

01:05:02.754 --> 01:05:03.553
- Okay.
- Go.

01:05:03.587 --> 01:05:04.756
Okay.

01:05:09.493 --> 01:05:10.594
This could be it.

01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:15.767
Do you know how to pick a lock?

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:16.600
No, do you?

01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:17.734
No.

01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:20.437
But I don't see any keys
around here so we have to try.

01:05:27.879 --> 01:05:30.681
Look at this place, this
most be worth a fortune.

01:05:30.714 --> 01:05:33.283
Hugh, this isn't the
fucking "Antiques Roadshow"!

01:05:36.253 --> 01:05:37.187
What are you doing?

01:05:37.822 --> 01:05:38.923
It's got a key.

01:05:38.956 --> 01:05:40.892
If it's got a key there's
something valuable inside.

01:05:40.925 --> 01:05:43.193
We're not here to loot
the fucking place, Hugh!

01:05:43.861 --> 01:05:44.862
We need to get the
hell out of here!

01:05:44.896 --> 01:05:46.596
Help us get this door open!

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.334
Oh my God.

01:05:52.335 --> 01:05:52.970
What!

01:05:54.906 --> 01:05:56.339
Necronomicon.

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.376
Is that supposed to
mean something to us?

01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:01.611
This is one of the most
famous occult books

01:06:01.645 --> 01:06:02.546
in the whole world.

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:03.848
It's got enormous powers.

01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:05.850
Earlier Edith said,
she sensed something

01:06:05.883 --> 01:06:07.752
of significance
was in the vault.

01:06:07.785 --> 01:06:09.787
Something the spirits
didn't want us to find.

01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:10.788
Could this be it?

01:06:10.822 --> 01:06:11.956
Yeah, it could be.

01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:14.658
I mean I heard that they
collected historical artifacts.

01:06:14.691 --> 01:06:16.326
I never thought they had this.

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:19.496
Could we potentially use
it to ward of the spirits?

01:06:19.529 --> 01:06:20.497
I think we could.

01:06:21.698 --> 01:06:22.867
Maybe we shouldn't
be messing around

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.734
with something like that.

01:06:23.768 --> 01:06:25.770
But we gotta try
something, haven't we?

01:06:25.803 --> 01:06:29.606
Maybe we can use this
book to lift the spirits

01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:30.741
and make our escape.

01:07:12.083 --> 01:07:14.351
If spirits threaten
us in this place,

01:07:14.384 --> 01:07:16.854
fight water by water
and fire by fire.

01:07:16.888 --> 01:07:19.757
Banish those souls
into nothingness

01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:22.927
and remove their powers
until the last trace.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.497
Let these evil beings flee
through time and space.

01:07:27.531 --> 01:07:30.634
By earth, by wind,
by water and by fire

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:34.504
banish the darkness and
bring forth the light.

01:07:34.538 --> 01:07:38.810
Oh evil spirit in the
name of the Holy One

01:07:38.843 --> 01:07:40.945
I cast thee to hell!

01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:39.837
Come on, Hugh!

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.921
What, what the hell happened?

01:08:57.955 --> 01:09:00.791
I thought the secret exit
led into the grounds?

01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:02.459
That's what they told me.

01:09:10.868 --> 01:09:13.069
Oh Enos, thank God you're here.

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:14.971
Listen, it's been
a total disaster

01:09:15.006 --> 01:09:17.073
we need to get the police
out here right now!

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.049
Why is he ignoring us?

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:27.018
I don't know.

01:09:27.051 --> 01:09:28.953
Enos, are you listening?

01:09:28.986 --> 01:09:30.854
We had no phone reception.

01:09:30.888 --> 01:09:32.455
We couldn't call anyone.

01:09:32.488 --> 01:09:34.557
We've been stuck
in here all night.

01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:40.430
Enos, this isn't funny!

01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:42.899
Answer us for Christ's sake!

01:10:14.231 --> 01:10:18.535
We encountered a lot of
poltergeist phenomenon.

01:10:20.704 --> 01:10:22.672
Enos, this
is getting ridiculous!

01:10:22.706 --> 01:10:23.740
Speak to us!

01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:00.610
Oh my god!
