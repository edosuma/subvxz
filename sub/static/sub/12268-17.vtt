WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:01.772
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:01.772 --> 00:03.204
I'VE BEEN FINISHING
CARRION.

00:03.204 --> 00:04.535
THE PEOPLE
THAT TOOK YOUR DAD

00:04.535 --> 00:06.077
DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD

00:06.077 --> 00:07.778
WHEN IT COMES TO FULFILLING
THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN.

00:07.778 --> 00:10.481
AIDEN MATHIS, WELCOME ABOARD.
 (applause)

00:10.481 --> 00:11.782
KENNY WAS DRIVING
THAT BOAT?

00:11.782 --> 00:13.514
MAKES SENSE, CONSIDERING
NO ONE CAME FORWARD

00:13.514 --> 00:15.416
TO SAY THEY SAVED YOUR LIFE.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.088
THEY'RE HIDING THEIR MONEY
IN THIS FOUNDATION

00:17.088 --> 00:19.790
IN CASE THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION
AND THEIR ASSETS ARE FROZEN.

00:19.790 --> 00:22.793
IF WE CAN ACCESS
THAT ACCOUNT, WE COULD--
 BANKRUPT THE GRAYSONS.

00:22.793 --> 00:25.656
WHOEVER WROTE THE CODE
PROTECTING THIS BANK ACCOUNT

00:25.656 --> 00:27.758
IS THE SAME PERSON THAT SEALED
YOUR FATHER'S FATE.

00:27.758 --> 00:29.660
THE FALCON IS BACK.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.262
MY FOSTER BROTHER
SHOWED UP.

00:31.262 --> 00:34.765
ELI WAS MY PROTECTOR
TILL I BURNT DOWN OUR HOUSE.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.637
ELI JAMES.
 WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO BE A GUEST

00:36.637 --> 00:39.670
AT THE INAUGURAL BENEFIT
IN YOUR SISTER'S NAME.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.772
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD
FOR A DEAD GIRL.

00:41.772 --> 00:44.715
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED THAT I'M
GONNA MESS THINGS UP, ARE YOU?

00:55.786 --> 00:59.290
(Emily) IN THE ART OF WAR...

00:59.290 --> 01:02.833
IF YOU KNOW THE ENEMY
 AND KNOW YOURSELF...

01:04.635 --> 01:08.239
YOU NEED NOT FEAR
 THE APPROACHING BATTLES.

01:08.239 --> 01:09.440
(pen cap clicks)

01:13.704 --> 01:15.676
(door creaks open)

01:15.676 --> 01:17.408
(book clatters)

01:17.408 --> 01:18.679
(door creaks closed)

01:18.679 --> 01:21.552
(footsteps approach)

01:25.356 --> 01:28.159
AMANDA.

01:29.460 --> 01:31.562
ELI?

01:31.562 --> 01:33.564
READING THIS BOOK
A THOUSAND TIMES

01:33.564 --> 01:35.366
WON'T CHANGE WHAT HE DID.

01:35.366 --> 01:36.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

01:36.667 --> 01:39.099
YOU GOT PICKED
BY THAT FAMILY.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.272
WE MADE A PROMISE,
REMEMBER?

01:41.272 --> 01:43.804
STAY TOGETHER,
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.838
BUT IF YOU KNOW ONLY YOURSELF
 AND NOT YOUR ENEMY...

01:49.680 --> 01:51.612
FOR EVERY VICTORY...

01:51.612 --> 01:53.644
(Aiden) EMILY?
 (presses keys)

01:53.644 --> 01:55.546
THERE WILL ALSO BE DEFEAT.

01:55.546 --> 01:58.749
I TAKE IT THIS IS NOT YOU
TRYING TO I.D. THE FALCON.

01:58.749 --> 02:00.651
(sighs) NOLAN'S ON THAT.
 (kisses)

02:00.651 --> 02:04.325
I FOUND OUT THAT ELI'S BEEN IN
CONTACT WITH OUR FOSTER MOTHER.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.826
MISS HAYWARD. I THOUGHT
SHE WAS HORRIBLE TO YOU.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.398
(huffs) SHE WAS.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.229
MADE A SMALL FORTUNE TAKING IN
OLDER, UNWANTED ORPHANS,

02:09.229 --> 02:10.860
SCAMMING THE AGENCIES,

02:10.860 --> 02:13.634
CONVINCING THEM THE MONEY
WENT TO BETTER OUR LIVES.
 (printer whirs)

02:13.634 --> 02:14.805
IT DIDN'T.

02:14.805 --> 02:17.137
AND THESE ARE THE KIDS
YOU LIVED WITH?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.470
AND THIS IS WHERE
THEY ARE NOW.
 (clicking keys)

02:19.470 --> 02:22.513
ADDICTS, PROSTITUTES,
FELONS.

02:22.513 --> 02:23.814
ELI'S GOT INTO YOUR HEAD...
 (laptop clicks)

02:23.814 --> 02:25.816
AND YOUR HEART,
WHICH MEANS HE HAS TO GO.

02:25.816 --> 02:28.179
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T HURT HIM.

02:28.179 --> 02:29.720
I NEED TIME.

02:29.720 --> 02:33.854
(exhales) WHAT'S HAPPENING
AT GRAYSON GLOBAL?

02:33.854 --> 02:36.327
PRECIOUS LITTLE.

02:36.327 --> 02:37.788
SINCE I WAS UPGRADED
TO THE BOARD,

02:37.788 --> 02:40.761
DANIEL'S GONE ODDLY QUIET.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.763
AS FOR DANIEL, HE'S GONNA
KEEP YOU OUT OF THE LOOP

02:42.763 --> 02:46.166
SO LONG AS HE'S PLANNING ON
MAKING YOU HIS PATSY.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.239
BUT I KNOW HIM.

02:48.239 --> 02:49.740
HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

02:49.740 --> 02:51.672
HE'S GONNA NEED TO CONFIDE
IN SOMEONE.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.645
AND WE BOTH KNOW
WHO THAT'S GONNA BE.

02:54.645 --> 02:57.208
(huffs)

02:57.208 --> 02:58.779
(sighs)

02:58.779 --> 03:01.212
(touch screen clicks,
beep, auto-dials)

03:01.212 --> 03:04.184
(phone rings, line clicks)

03:04.184 --> 03:05.616
DANIEL, IT'S EMILY.

03:05.616 --> 03:08.489
MR. TAYLOR,
NICE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.822
IS THERE A TIME
WHEN WE COULD SAFELY SPEAK?

03:11.822 --> 03:13.494
SURE. HOW ABOUT IN PERSON?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.896
UM, CAN YOU
HAVE LUNCH TOMORROW, SAY...

03:15.896 --> 03:17.598
1:00?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.330
THAT'S PERFECT.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.201
TERRIFIC.
I'LL TEXT YOU THE DETAILS.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.274
OKAY.

03:23.274 --> 03:24.675
(beep)

03:24.675 --> 03:25.736
(beep)

03:25.736 --> 03:26.907
GRACE?

03:28.839 --> 03:30.681
A 1:00 FOR 2 TOMORROW
AT CAFE ARNAUD.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.583
MAKE IT UNDER TAYLOR.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.285
WELL, GRAYSON WILL GET YOU
A BETTER TABLE.

03:34.285 --> 03:36.287
AFTER I GOT INTO IT
WITH THAT GUY THE OTHER DAY,

03:36.287 --> 03:37.918
THE PAPARAZZI'S
BEEN GUNNING FOR ME.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.520
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.821
DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER
FOR MR. TAYLOR

03:40.821 --> 03:42.693
SO I CAN LET HIM KNOW?

03:42.693 --> 03:46.297
I'LL HANDLE IT.
THANKS, GRACE.

03:46.297 --> 03:48.459
(Conrad)
DANIEL IS FAR TOO TRUSTING

03:48.459 --> 03:50.901
OF THE WOMEN WITH WHOM
HE INVOLVES HIMSELF.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.433
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU

03:52.433 --> 03:53.734
HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM
IT WOULD POSE

03:53.734 --> 03:56.407
IF DANIEL WERE TO UNBURDEN
HIMSELF OF RECENT EVENTS

03:56.407 --> 03:57.738
ONTO EMILY THORNE.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.411
CONRAD, FOR ONCE, I HATE
TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH YOU,

04:00.411 --> 04:02.613
BUT IT'S EXACTLY
THAT MISGUIDED AFFECTION

04:02.613 --> 04:04.845
THAT WE CAN USE
TO KEEP DANIEL QUIET.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.846
(Ashley) CONRAD.

04:05.846 --> 04:06.977
OH, GOOD MORNING,
MS. DAVENPORT.

04:06.977 --> 04:08.649
NOT FOR YOU, IT ISN'T.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.950
YOUR POLLING NUMBERS
ARE ABYSMAL.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.752
WELL, THESE NUMBERS
ARE BASED

04:11.752 --> 04:14.254
SOLELY ON BOORS WATCHING
THEIR DAYTIME TALK SHOWS,

04:14.254 --> 04:15.756
ANSWERING
THEIR ROTARY PHONES.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.459
THAT KIND OF TALK
WILL HARDLY CAPTURE

04:18.459 --> 04:20.461
THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T OWN

04:20.461 --> 04:23.263
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
SECOND AND THIRD HOMES.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.466
THE ONLY POSITIVE WAS
THE BUMPS YOU RECEIVED

04:25.466 --> 04:27.868
FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION

04:27.868 --> 04:30.000
AND YOUR TV APPEARANCE
WITH JACK PORTER.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.774
(doorbell rings)
 AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY
TO CONTINUE RAISING AWARENESS

04:33.774 --> 04:35.506
FOR BOTH OUR CAUSES.
 (dish clatters)

04:35.506 --> 04:38.048
ALWAYS INTERESTED
IN A FRESH IDEA.

04:38.048 --> 04:39.950
AREN'T WE ALL?

04:39.950 --> 04:41.752
I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE.

04:41.752 --> 04:45.856
EMILY, WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO START A PRIVATE MEETING.

04:45.856 --> 04:47.518
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I INVITED HER.

04:47.518 --> 04:48.759
MM.

04:48.759 --> 04:50.721
AFTER YOU
APPOINTED ME CO-CHAIR,

04:50.721 --> 04:54.024
EMILY HERE OFFERED
HER SERVICES.

04:55.866 --> 04:56.997
SO WHAT HAVE I MISSED?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.799
WELL, MR. JAMES HERE

04:58.799 --> 05:00.731
WAS ABOUT TO RESCUE
MY CAMPAIGN.

05:00.731 --> 05:02.733
WELL, IN TRUTH,
MR. GRAYSON,

05:02.733 --> 05:06.036
IT'S MORE ABOUT
THE FOUNDATION AND AMANDA.

05:06.036 --> 05:08.709
NOW THIS IS SOMETHING

05:08.709 --> 05:10.711
I TRULY BELIEVE
CAN BE A BENEFIT.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.913
THAT'S MEREDITH HAYWARD.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.815
SHE WAS MY FOSTER MOTHER,
AND AMANDA'S.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.818
WELL, IF THIS IS THE WOMAN
WHOSE HOUSE AMANDA BURNED DOWN,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.520
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SHE WOULD
WANT TO TAKE PART

05:19.520 --> 05:21.692
IN A FOUNDATION
BEARING AMANDA'S NAME?

05:21.692 --> 05:23.394
(coffee pouring)

05:23.394 --> 05:26.497
WELL, IT'S SIMPLE.

05:26.497 --> 05:30.831
MRS. H. ALWAYS TAUGHT US
THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.434
BUT IN RECENT YEARS,

05:33.434 --> 05:35.536
HAYWARD HOUSE HAS FALLEN
ON HARD TIMES.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.409
SO YOU THINK THE A.C.F.
SHOULD SPONSOR HER HOME?

05:38.409 --> 05:40.911
OUT OF THE ASHES,
A BEACON OF HOPE?

05:40.911 --> 05:42.713
AND WITH AMANDA'S CONNECTION
TO JACK PORTER,

05:42.713 --> 05:44.745
IT'S A WIN-WIN
FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN...

05:44.745 --> 05:47.848
AND THE FOUNDATION.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.979
(Victoria) WELL, THEN,

05:48.979 --> 05:50.581
SINCE IT'S MR. JAMES' IDEA,

05:50.581 --> 05:51.882
I THINK HE SHOULD RUN
WITH IT.

05:51.882 --> 05:53.053
WELL, GREAT.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.486
I'LL GO PITCH MRS. H.
THE IDEA TODAY.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.057
I WOULD LOVE TO ACCOMPANY YOU.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.759
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SEE
HOW AMANDA GREW UP.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.030
BY ALL MEANS.

06:02.132 --> 06:04.635
MR. ELI JAMES--

06:04.635 --> 06:06.897
THERE'S A YOUNG MAN
TO WATCH.

06:06.897 --> 06:09.069
(door opens)
 I'LL SAY.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.003
(rapid beeping)

06:13.003 --> 06:14.805
(clicks keyboard keys)

06:14.805 --> 06:16.907
(beeps)
 (Padma) NOLAN.

06:16.907 --> 06:18.609
(door closes)

06:18.609 --> 06:20.711
PADMA, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HIDING.

06:20.711 --> 06:21.882
IT IS NOT SAFE
FOR YOU HERE.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.414
IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR ME ANYWHERE.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.985
I JUST RECEIVED THIS.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.717
MY FATHER'S NOT DEAD.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.118
(sighs)

06:34.725 --> 06:36.767
(clicks keyboard keys)

06:36.767 --> 06:39.670
PADMA, MERI JAAN,

06:39.670 --> 06:40.971
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

06:40.971 --> 06:43.804
THERE IS AN ALLEY
 BETWEEN OSWALD AND DRAKE,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.736
NEAR THE EAST RIVER.

06:45.736 --> 06:48.909
IN TWO DAYS' TIME, YOU MUST
 COME WITH THE CARRION PROGRAM.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.483
COME AT NOON. BRING
 NOTHING ELSE AND NO ONE ELSE.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.685
OTHERWISE, THEY WILL KILL ME

06:54.685 --> 06:55.846
AND YOU.
 (beep)

06:55.846 --> 06:58.418
OH, MY GOD.
WHERE'S CARRION?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.850
IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.892
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED TO MAKE
SOME ADJUSTMENTS

07:01.892 --> 07:03.193
TO ITS FLASH DRIVE.

07:03.193 --> 07:04.725
PADMA,

07:04.725 --> 07:07.558
I SWEAR TO YOU,
ON MY LIFE,

07:07.558 --> 07:09.730
I WON'T LET
ANY HARM COME TO YOU

07:09.730 --> 07:11.031
OR YOUR FATHER.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.603
BUT, UH...

07:12.603 --> 07:15.065
WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME REINFORCEMENTS.

07:15.065 --> 07:16.867
I TRUST YOU.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.208
GOOD.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.810
(kisses)

07:19.810 --> 07:21.872
SO WHAT'S YOUR END GAME, ELI?

07:21.872 --> 07:23.874
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION

07:23.874 --> 07:25.846
THE BEST IT CAN BE.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.947
YEAH, I REALIZED THAT
WHEN YOU INVESTED

07:26.947 --> 07:28.819
MY $100,000 INTO IT.

07:28.819 --> 07:30.150
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE
FOR THE MONEY,

07:30.150 --> 07:31.822
THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT?

07:31.822 --> 07:33.884
YOU ACT LIKE YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT THAT BITCH DID TO US.

07:33.884 --> 07:35.055
(Amanda) NO!

07:35.055 --> 07:38.058
LET GO OF ME! OW! OW!
(cries)

07:40.090 --> 07:41.962
I REMEMBER JUST FINE.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.035
WELL, THEN LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING

07:45.035 --> 07:46.867
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
REMEMBER.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.670
SHE KEPT A BUNCH OF LETTERS
YOUR FATHER HAD WRITTEN YOU.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.702
YOU'RE LYING.

07:55.245 --> 07:58.478
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A MAN WHO
DIDN'T LOVE HIS DAUGHTER TO ME.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.782
(rustles paper)

08:01.782 --> 08:03.784
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

08:03.784 --> 08:07.658
I FOUND IT IN HAYWARD'S SAFE
AFTER THEY TOOK YOU AWAY.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.860
I COULD ONLY POCKET ONE
BEFORE SHE CAUGHT ME.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.962
AS FAR AS I KNOW,
SHE'S STILL GOT THE REST.

08:11.962 --> 08:14.565
I WANT TO GET THEM BACK
FOR YOU.

08:14.565 --> 08:15.726
WHY?

08:15.726 --> 08:17.227
'CAUSE I ONCE MADE YOU
A PROMISE

08:17.227 --> 08:18.769
TO ALWAYS LOOK AFTER YOU.

08:18.769 --> 08:22.703
AND HAYWARD DESERVES
TO BE PUNISHED.

08:24.274 --> 08:26.907
LOOK, I'M DOING THIS
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.779
FINE.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.140
(jangles keys)

08:30.140 --> 08:32.683
BUT WE DO IT MY WAY.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.632
DID HE TELL YOU WHAT HE WROTE
IN THE LETTERS?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.263
A REBUTTAL OF EVERYTHING
THAT TREADWELL LIED ABOUT.

08:53.263 --> 08:55.105
WHEN YOU NEVER ANSWERED,

08:55.105 --> 08:56.767
HE CREATED THOSE JOURNALS
FOR YOU.

08:56.767 --> 08:59.670
LOOK, EMS, THERE WAS NOTHING
THAT DAVID WROTE

08:59.670 --> 09:00.811
THAT WOULD'VE
CHANGED ANYTHING.

09:00.811 --> 09:01.972
YOU KNOW NOW--

09:01.972 --> 09:03.674
IT COULD'VE CHANGED EVERYTHING,
NOLAN.

09:03.674 --> 09:05.145
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN THAT
MY FATHER WAS REACHING OUT,

09:05.145 --> 09:07.618
I MIGHT NOT HAVE LOST HIM,
I MIGHT NOT HAVE LIT THAT FIRE,

09:07.618 --> 09:08.919
I MIGHT NOT HAVE GONE TO JUVIE.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.550
AND AMANDA--

09:10.550 --> 09:13.924
MIGHT.
 MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.226
(sighs)

09:16.226 --> 09:17.588
(jangles keys)

09:17.588 --> 09:18.929
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:18.929 --> 09:19.990
DRIVING DOWN WITH ELI

09:19.990 --> 09:21.592
TO MANAGE
OUR FOSTER MOTHER SITUATION.

09:21.592 --> 09:23.594
BUT FIRST,
I WANT TO CHECK ON JACK.

09:23.594 --> 09:24.965
(huffs) WELL, NOT TO SOUND
ALL NEEDY,

09:24.965 --> 09:27.738
BUT WE DO HAVE THE WHOLE
CARRION/PADMA'S FATHER EXCHANGE

09:27.738 --> 09:28.869
THING TO DEAL WITH,

09:28.869 --> 09:31.341
AND I COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.143
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES,
I'LL BE THERE.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.806
AIDEN WILL FILL YOU IN.

09:35.806 --> 09:37.878
DID YOU BRING CARRION?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.579
(typing)

09:39.579 --> 09:40.911
WHAT'S THAT?

09:40.911 --> 09:42.082
IT'S A FLASH DRIVE

09:42.082 --> 09:44.755
WITH A TRACKING DEVICE
BUILT INTO THE HEAD.

09:44.755 --> 09:46.787
WE'LL KNOW WHERE IT IS
AT ALL TIMES.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.258
THAT'S A GOOD BACKUP.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.161
(clicks keyboard keys)
 HERE. HAVE A LOOK.

09:51.161 --> 09:53.964
THE TOP FLOOR
OF THIS CAR PARK

09:53.964 --> 09:56.026
PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT
VANTAGE POINT FOR THE EXCHANGE.

09:56.026 --> 09:57.367
WHEN PADMA'S FATHER'S RELEASED,

09:57.367 --> 09:58.829
I'LL SIMPLY TAKE OUT
THE PLAYERS.

09:58.829 --> 10:02.833
MM. THE PLAN IS TO...
SHOOT PEOPLE?

10:02.833 --> 10:05.335
NOT PEOPLE, NOLAN. TERRORISTS.
 (resumes typing)

10:05.335 --> 10:06.707
WHAT--WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

10:06.707 --> 10:07.978
THAT BLOWING PEOPLE'S
BRAINS OUT

10:07.978 --> 10:09.640
WON'T PUT A BIGGER TARGET
ON THE LAHARIS' HEAD?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.111
THEY CAN'T HARM THEM
IF THEY CAN'T FIND THEM.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.383
PADMA AND HER FATHER
ARE GONNA HAVE TO DISAPPEAR.

10:13.383 --> 10:15.916
WHAT?

10:15.916 --> 10:17.287
(scoffs)

10:17.287 --> 10:19.349
FOR GOOD?

10:19.349 --> 10:22.622
(sighs)
EMILY HAS ALREADY FOUND

10:22.622 --> 10:25.325
THEIR NEW IDENTITIES
AND A LOCATION.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.698
I'M SORRY, NOLAN,
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE PADMA

10:27.698 --> 10:29.860
IS TO, UM...

10:29.860 --> 10:31.261
LET HER GO.

10:34.164 --> 10:37.167
(seagulls calling)

10:43.874 --> 10:44.845
HEY.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.016
MM.

10:46.016 --> 10:47.147
HOW YOU DOING?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.318
HEY.

10:48.318 --> 10:49.720
LITTLE GUY
KEEP YOU UP ALL NIGHT?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.822
NO, NO, NO.
CARL SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

10:51.822 --> 10:56.186
I JUST... CAN'T STOMACH
THAT EMPTY BED.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.028
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

10:58.028 --> 10:59.329
ANY LUCK FINDING KENNY?

10:59.329 --> 11:02.262
NO. NONE.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.965
HIS APARTMENT'S EMPTY.
HIS PHONE'S BEEN DISCONNECTED.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.868
THERE'S NO ACTIVITY
ON HIS CREDIT CARDS.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.139
NOLAN.

11:09.139 --> 11:10.300
AH.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.842
I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T GIVE UP,

11:11.842 --> 11:13.403
BUT I... (sighs) I KEEP
HITTING THESE DEAD ENDS.

11:13.403 --> 11:16.006
IF I CAN'T FIND KENNY,
I MAY NEVER KNOW

11:16.006 --> 11:18.809
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO AMANDA,
OR WORSE,

11:18.809 --> 11:19.950
WHY IT HAPPENED.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.451
WELL, MAYBE DON'T GIVE UP
JUST YET.

11:21.451 --> 11:22.983
(knock on door)
 I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA.

11:22.983 --> 11:23.954
(Emily) JACK, YOU IN THERE?

11:23.954 --> 11:25.115
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

11:25.115 --> 11:26.987
I'M NOT GONNA DO...

11:26.987 --> 11:28.819
(seagulls calling)

11:30.460 --> 11:31.822
EMILY.

11:31.822 --> 11:34.294
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA GET BACK TO CLASS.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.465
BUT, UH,

11:35.465 --> 11:36.827
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

11:36.827 --> 11:37.798
OKAY.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.800
BYE, EMILY.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.102
(sighs) YOU'RE NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.074
YEAH, I WAS BUSY.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.276
STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

11:46.276 --> 11:48.438
TO GET BACK AT CONRAD?

11:48.438 --> 11:52.442
(chuckles) EVEN IF I WANTED
TO GO AFTER CONRAD,

11:52.442 --> 11:55.045
HE STOLE THE COMPUTER,
WHICH WAS MY ONLY LEVERAGE.

11:55.045 --> 11:56.917
STOLE IT...

11:56.917 --> 12:00.821
WHILE MY WIFE
WAS BEING BURIED.
 (Carl fussing)

12:00.821 --> 12:02.823
ANYWAY...

12:06.056 --> 12:09.900
I NEED TO FOCUS ON CARL.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.832
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.105
JACK, I THINK YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

12:15.105 --> 12:18.508
AMANDA WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED YOU
TO FIGHT THIS BATTLE FOR HER.

12:18.508 --> 12:21.972
SHE WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY.

12:21.972 --> 12:24.744
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.949
IT'S GOTTA BE
ONE OR THE OTHER.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.384
(Charlotte) HOW'S JACK?

12:34.384 --> 12:36.426
HE'S BEAT UP, YOU KNOW?
 (school bell ringing)

12:36.426 --> 12:38.258
THERE ARE A LOT
OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.090
I WISH I COULD
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.492
UH... UH, HOW--HOW ARE YOU?

12:42.492 --> 12:45.796
IT'S BEEN NICE HAVING
AMANDA'S FOSTER BROTHER AROUND.

12:45.796 --> 12:47.267
I THINK YOU'D LIKE ELI
IF YOU GOT TO KNOW HIM.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.999
(chuckles) YEAH,
I'M SURE I WOULD.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.200
GOOD, BECAUSE HE'S WORKING

12:50.200 --> 12:51.842
ON A PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN THE FOUNDATION

12:51.842 --> 12:53.874
AND THE FOSTER MOTHER
HE SHARED WITH AMANDA.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.176
I WAS HOPING WE COULD
ANNOUNCE IT AT THE STOWAWAY--

12:56.176 --> 12:58.248
AMANDA'S FINAL HOME--

12:58.248 --> 13:00.911
IF YOU THINK JACK
WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT.

13:00.911 --> 13:02.983
YEAH. YOU KNOW, HE'D DO
ANYTHING FOR AMANDA,

13:02.983 --> 13:05.085
AND SO WOULD I, SO I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.057
THANK YOU, DECLAN.

13:07.057 --> 13:08.388
YEAH.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.290
I'M GONNA CALL ELI
AND TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.322
OKAY.

13:12.322 --> 13:15.926
(indistinct conversations)

13:20.100 --> 13:21.431
OHH!
 OH, I'M SORRY, TREY.

13:21.431 --> 13:22.802
WHAT THE HELL, PORTER?

13:22.802 --> 13:23.974
YEAH, MY BAD.

13:23.974 --> 13:24.975
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
MAN.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.107
SORRY.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.849
SO WE'RE GETTING
NEW IDENTITIES?

13:38.849 --> 13:40.150
YEAH.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.152
AIDEN WILL GET THEM
TO YOU AND YOUR FATHER

13:42.152 --> 13:44.254
ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

13:44.254 --> 13:47.227
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.431
I DON'T KNOW.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.865
I... I CAN'T KNOW.

13:54.865 --> 13:57.567
ARE YOU SAYING I MAY NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN?

13:57.567 --> 13:59.469
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO ENSURE

13:59.469 --> 14:02.142
THAT THE INITIATIVE
NEVER FINDS YOU.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.473
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF CASH

14:03.473 --> 14:05.075
AND SUBSTANTIAL
BANK ACCOUNTS--

14:05.075 --> 14:08.048
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANY OF THAT.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.050
I CAN'T FLY OFF SOMEWHERE

14:10.050 --> 14:13.083
AND LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE
WITHOUT YOU.

14:14.584 --> 14:16.086
I LOVE YOU.

14:18.929 --> 14:21.932
AND I LOVE YOU, TOO,

14:21.932 --> 14:23.493
SO MUCH.

14:23.493 --> 14:25.966
HEY.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.970
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
THAT THINGS END FOR US.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.871
SOMEDAY...

14:31.871 --> 14:35.205
YOU'LL BE...
SITTING ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE,

14:35.205 --> 14:37.577
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT
THE INITIATIVE WAS EXPOSED

14:37.577 --> 14:41.011
AND THE THREAT IS GONE.

14:41.011 --> 14:43.914
(sniffles)

14:43.914 --> 14:45.385
YOU BETTER BE
WALKING DOWN THAT BEACH

14:45.385 --> 14:47.557
TEN SECONDS LATER.

14:47.557 --> 14:50.320
I WILL BE RUNNING.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.661
(exhales)

14:58.969 --> 15:00.971
ANY SIGN
THAT SHE RECOGNIZES ME,

15:00.971 --> 15:02.272
AND WE WALK.

15:02.272 --> 15:03.934
(children shouting playfully)

15:03.934 --> 15:05.535
HELLO.

15:05.535 --> 15:07.037
YOU MUST BE MS. THORNE.

15:07.037 --> 15:08.538
EMILY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:08.538 --> 15:10.680
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SEEING US
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.983
WELL, ANYTHING
FOR POOR AMANDA CLARKE.

15:12.983 --> 15:15.145
SHE WAS VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.950
I'M AFRAID THAT TIME
IS NOT ON THE CHILDREN'S SIDE.

15:19.950 --> 15:21.451
WITHOUT FULL PAYMENT
AND PENALTY,

15:21.451 --> 15:24.094
I'LL LOSE THIS HOUSE
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.595
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.427
WHEN THE GRAYSONS PUT
THEIR RESOURCES TO WORK,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.029
THINGS HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.031
(chuckles) BUT WE HOPE
TO PRESENT YOU A CHECK

15:31.031 --> 15:33.433
TO COVER ALL YOUR EXPENSES
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE TOMORROW.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.935
MY GOODNESS. THAT IS FAST.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.968
(chuckles)

15:37.968 --> 15:39.609
I KNOW THIS IS A LONG SHOT,

15:39.609 --> 15:41.711
BUT WE'RE ALSO WONDERING
IF YOU STILL HAVE ANY

15:41.711 --> 15:43.543
PERSONAL ITEMS
FROM AMANDA'S YOUTH,

15:43.543 --> 15:46.676
ANYTHING TO POTENTIALLY
CONNECT DONORS TO HER PAST?

15:46.676 --> 15:49.379
OH, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT.

15:49.379 --> 15:52.222
ANYTHING THAT WAS PERSONAL
OF AMANDA'S

15:52.222 --> 15:54.224
WOULD'VE BEEN LOST
IN THE FIRE.

15:54.224 --> 15:55.685
OF COURSE.

15:55.685 --> 15:59.529
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO MEET
SOME OF YOUR CURRENT KIDS.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.631
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN FEATURE
THEM IN OUR NEW LITERATURE.

16:01.631 --> 16:04.364
OH, WELL,
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU AROUND.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.696
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY
HAVE TO RETURN A PHONE CALL,

16:06.696 --> 16:08.238
SO I'LL--
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU.

16:08.238 --> 16:09.399
YOU GO AHEAD.

16:09.399 --> 16:10.740
OH. MM.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.380
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.382
WE'RE GONNA SOAK THESE PEOPLE
FOR MORE MONEY

16:22.382 --> 16:24.384
THAN YOU'D MAKE IN A LIFETIME
FLEECING THE STATE.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.186
THANKS FOR THIS, ELI.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.658
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I NEED THIS MONEY.

16:28.658 --> 16:32.122
LOOK, I'M NOT DOING THIS OUT
OF THE GOODNESS OF MY HEART.

16:32.122 --> 16:33.623
I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE YOU TAUGHT ME

16:33.623 --> 16:35.465
HOW TO SEIZE
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

16:35.465 --> 16:37.467
KICKING ME BACK
60% OF THIS SCAM

16:37.467 --> 16:40.070
IS GONNA HEAL
A LOT OF WOUNDS.

16:40.070 --> 16:42.132
TRUST ME.

17:15.204 --> 17:16.366
(handle clinks)

17:16.366 --> 17:18.538
(door creaks)

17:21.371 --> 17:23.542
(Amanda) NO! LET GO OF ME!

17:23.542 --> 17:25.545
(crying) NO!

17:25.545 --> 17:29.119
NO PARENT
WILL EVER WANT YOU.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.051
(door opens)

17:32.051 --> 17:33.483
(Eli) EMILY?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.457
(handle clinks)

17:38.828 --> 17:40.790
(wheels squeak)

17:43.062 --> 17:44.834
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.367
OKAY. THANK YOU.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.270
SORRY. I GOT LOST
TRYING TO FIND YOU.
 (cell phone beeps)

17:51.671 --> 17:54.204
WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED HERE

17:54.204 --> 17:56.546
IS TRULY IMPRESSIVE.
 (claps hands together)

17:56.546 --> 17:57.747
(chuckles)

17:57.747 --> 18:00.310
WELL, I HOPE THIS MEANS
I'VE PASSED INSPECTION.

18:00.310 --> 18:02.812
WITH FLYING COLORS.

18:02.812 --> 18:09.759
(all laugh)

18:11.321 --> 18:12.862
MEREDITH, I'VE HEARD SO MANY
WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU.

18:12.862 --> 18:15.565
ONE ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT ELI
TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

18:15.565 --> 18:17.567
WELL, ELI WAS ALWAYS
VERY SPECIAL TO ME,

18:17.567 --> 18:18.868
AS WAS AMANDA CLARKE.

18:18.868 --> 18:21.471
OH, HOW NICE.

18:21.471 --> 18:25.104
THOUGH I DON'T THINK
I COULD EVER FORGIVE ANYONE

18:25.104 --> 18:27.537
WHO SET FIRE TO EVERYTHING
I CARED ABOUT.

18:27.537 --> 18:30.740
I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE IT
FROM AMANDA'S PERSPECTIVE.

18:30.740 --> 18:33.313
I MEAN, SHE FELT LIKE
SHE COULDN'T TRUST ANYONE.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.615
AND BEING A MOTHERLESS CHILD,

18:35.615 --> 18:39.149
AND HER FATHER TURNING OUT
TO BE THIS OTHER... PERSON,

18:39.149 --> 18:41.451
SHE JUST HAD SO MUCH PAIN.

18:41.451 --> 18:43.223
(Meredith) INDEED.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.325
I'VE LONG SINCE FORGIVEN HER.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.157
WELL...

18:47.157 --> 18:48.628
WE'LL PRESENT THE FIRST CHECK
TO YOU

18:48.628 --> 18:50.700
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE
THIS AFTERNOON.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.402
THE FIRST?

18:52.402 --> 18:54.904
YES, THE ONE TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR REMAINING MORTGAGE.

18:54.904 --> 18:56.606
THE REST OF THE FUNDS
WILL BE USED

18:56.606 --> 18:58.708
TO ENSURE
THAT AMANDA'S FORMER HOME

18:58.708 --> 19:00.870
REMAINS A PLACE
WHERE OTHER UNWANTED CHILDREN

19:00.870 --> 19:02.872
CAN FLOURISH
FOR YEARS TO COME.

19:02.872 --> 19:04.874
NOT TO SOUND CRASS,

19:04.874 --> 19:08.218
BUT WHAT SORT OF DONATION
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

19:08.218 --> 19:10.520
$250,000...

19:10.520 --> 19:13.183
ANNUALLY.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.654
BUT DOES THAT SOUND
REASONABLE?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.427
YOU ARE TRULY A GODSEND,
VICTORIA.

OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

19:23.593 --> 19:24.734
I FIGURED TREY WOULD HAVE

19:24.734 --> 19:26.266
KENNY'S NUMBER
IN HIS PHONE, RIGHT?

19:26.266 --> 19:27.867
SO I-I ROLLED HIM.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.699
SO YOU'RE SURE THAT
KENNY HAS NO IDEA

19:29.699 --> 19:31.641
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WAS TEXTING HIM?

19:31.641 --> 19:33.203
NO, HE'S GOT NO CLUE.

19:33.203 --> 19:34.744
HE THINKS HE'S MEETING TREY
IN A HALF AN HOUR, THOUGH,

19:34.744 --> 19:37.547
ON THE FIELD,
SO YOU BETTER GET MOVING.

19:37.547 --> 19:38.708
I'LL WATCH CARL.

WHAT THE HELL'S THAT ABOUT?
 UM...

19:43.713 --> 19:45.555
THAT WOULD BE ME. I-I THINK
I MIGHT HAVE TOLD CHARLOTTE

19:45.555 --> 19:47.487
THAT THEY COULD USE THE BAR
FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.818

HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.

IN A MORE OFFICIAL CAPACITY.

YOU WANT ME TO CONVINCE
THE POOR GUY

FOR THE CLOAK AND DAGGER.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.396
I KNOW THIS PLACE
WASN'T EASY TO FIND.

20:26.396 --> 20:27.857
NO, I'M JUST HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

20:27.857 --> 20:30.830
I'VE BEEN... WORRIED
SINCE WE LAST SPOKE.

IT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.432
ALL RIGHT, TAKING
MY FATHER'S SEAT ON THE BOARD

29:28.898 --> 29:30.199
I HAD TO KEEP YOU
OUT OF THE LOOP

29:30.199 --> 29:31.340
TO KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN.

29:31.340 --> 29:32.501
YOU JUST SHREDDED EVERY BIT

29:32.501 --> 29:34.844
OF THIS
FOUNDATION'S CREDIBILITY.
 NO.

29:34.844 --> 29:36.345
YOU SPIN THIS
THE RIGHT WAY,

29:36.345 --> 29:38.347
PEOPLE WILL SEE YOU
AS A HERO.

29:38.347 --> 29:40.179
BE THAT AS IT MAY,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.351
YOU ARE NO LONGER WELCOME
IN THIS FOUNDATION

29:42.351 --> 29:44.253
OR IN MY HOME.

29:48.517 --> 29:51.020
(Emily) IS IT TRUE?

29:55.524 --> 29:57.496
YOU SET THE FIRE?

29:58.928 --> 30:00.099
YES.

30:02.031 --> 30:05.875
THE ONE YOU LIT
BURNED OUT.

30:05.875 --> 30:08.237
SO I RESTARTED IT.

30:08.237 --> 30:10.880
BUT ONLY TO GET YOU
IN TROUBLE.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.943
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
OUT OF CONTROL IT WOULD GET,

30:13.943 --> 30:17.016
BUT... JUST THAT IT WAS
A MATTER OF TIME

30:17.016 --> 30:20.819
BEFORE A FAMILY
ADOPTED YOU OUT.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.052
I MEAN, WE HAD A PACT
TO STAY TOGETHER.

30:23.052 --> 30:26.325
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT LIGHTING THAT FIRE DID?

30:28.527 --> 30:31.200
MY WHOLE LIFE
COULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT, ELI.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.003
IT WAS SELFISH, I KNOW,
AND I'M SORRY.

30:34.003 --> 30:36.265
BUT I'M TRYING TO
MAKE IT UP TO YOU NOW.

30:36.265 --> 30:38.507
THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO LEAVE.

30:38.507 --> 30:41.040
AND IF YOU SO MUCH
AS EVEN THINK

30:41.040 --> 30:42.912
ABOUT EXPOSING MY IDENTITY--

30:42.912 --> 30:45.074
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT
TO YOU.

30:45.074 --> 30:47.576
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT BETWEEN US.

30:47.576 --> 30:49.348
YOU'LL SEE.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.253
ELI...

30:56.926 --> 30:58.157
(clatters)

30:59.458 --> 31:00.629
IT'S CLEAR.

31:03.492 --> 31:04.964
THEY SHOULD BE HERE.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.495
THE--THE LOCATOR SAYS
WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

31:06.495 --> 31:08.237
(cell phone chimes)

31:08.237 --> 31:10.039
OH, NO.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.540
WHAT?

31:13.572 --> 31:14.974
"SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND,
NOLAN.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.546
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO LOSE ONE'S... HEAD."

31:22.912 --> 31:25.584
(whispers) AIDEN, DON'T.

31:42.271 --> 31:44.903
IT'S THE TRACKING DEVICE.

31:49.038 --> 31:51.440
THEY KNEW ALL ALONG.

31:54.483 --> 31:56.445
AND NOW...

31:56.445 --> 31:59.148
WE'VE GIVEN OUR ENEMY

31:59.148 --> 32:03.592
THE MOST UNIMAGINABLY DANGEROUS
PROGRAM KNOWN TO MAN

32:03.592 --> 32:06.495
AND PUT
TWO INNOCENT PEOPLES' LIVES

32:06.495 --> 32:11.000
IN UNIMAGINABLE DANGER.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.333
YOU REALLY SHOULD CONSIDER
ANOTHER LINE OF WORK.

32:19.508 --> 32:21.310
(Nate) OKAY, LOOK,

32:21.310 --> 32:22.611
LET'S SAY SOMEBODY
 WAS ABLE TO REMOVE

32:22.611 --> 32:25.044
THIS LEVERAGE
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.076
IS THE DEAL BACK ON?

32:27.076 --> 32:28.417
(Conrad) AS IT STANDS,
 MR. RYAN,

32:28.417 --> 32:30.949
THAT'S
A PURELY HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.453
WE NEVER HAD
 THIS CONVERSATION.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.086
THE SON OF A BITCH PRACTICALLY
ORDERED A HIT ON YOU.

32:37.086 --> 32:38.257
YEAH,

32:38.257 --> 32:39.558
HYPOTHETICALLY...

32:39.558 --> 32:42.431
AND WITH
CAREFULLY CHOSEN WORDS.

32:42.431 --> 32:44.263
AND, UH, WHAT'S THE--

32:44.263 --> 32:45.734
WHAT'S THE LEVERAGE
HE MENTIONED?

32:45.734 --> 32:49.468
(sighs) IT'S SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU ABOUT YET.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.500
LOOK,
IT'S GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

32:51.500 --> 32:53.542
BUT AMANDA
WAS COLLECTING EVIDENCE

32:53.542 --> 32:55.004
AGAINST CONRAD.
 WHAT EVIDENCE?

32:55.004 --> 32:56.175
I DON'T KNOW WHAT,

32:56.175 --> 32:57.346
BUT SHE USED IT
TO BLACKMAIL HIM,

32:57.346 --> 32:58.577
TO GET US THE BAR BACK.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.549
AMANDA DID THAT FOR US?

33:00.549 --> 33:02.551
AND HE HAD HER KILLED
FOR IT.

33:02.551 --> 33:04.683
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THEN WE GOTTA
TAKE THAT TO THE POLICE.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.585
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
 NO, WE CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE.

33:06.585 --> 33:07.716
WE CAN'T TRUST THE POLICE,

33:07.716 --> 33:09.258
ESPECIALLY NOT WHEN IT COMES
TO THE RYANS.

33:09.258 --> 33:10.719
THEY HAD ME PUT IN JAIL,
REMEMBER?
 YES.

33:10.719 --> 33:13.222
NO, THE ONLY PEOPLE
WE CAN TRUST ARE EACH OTHER.

33:13.222 --> 33:14.563
YEAH, BUT THIS IS PROOF.
JACK, WE HAVE PROOF.

33:14.563 --> 33:16.065
THEY GOTTA PAY FOR THIS,
AND THIS--

33:16.065 --> 33:17.996
THIS DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING
TO ANYONE BUT ME.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.429
NOW I KNOW THAT CONRAD
WAS BEHIND NATE

33:20.429 --> 33:21.600
BEING ON THE BOAT.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.302
I JUST NEED...

33:23.302 --> 33:26.175
TO FIND SOME CONTRACT
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

33:26.175 --> 33:27.636
SOME PROOF THAT MONEY
CHANGED HANDS.

33:27.636 --> 33:29.508
AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?

33:32.281 --> 33:35.284
(crickets chirping in distance)

33:36.315 --> 33:39.448
(squeak)

33:39.448 --> 33:41.490
KNOCK, KNOCK.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.322
(sniffles)

33:43.322 --> 33:45.394
THEY TOOK THE KIDS.

33:46.625 --> 33:50.359
THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN
AN INVESTIGATION.

33:50.359 --> 33:52.361
GOOD.

33:52.361 --> 33:54.203
IT'S TOO BAD
AMANDA DIED

33:54.203 --> 33:57.206
BEFORE SHE COULD FIND OUT
WHAT YOU DID TO HER.

33:57.206 --> 33:59.168
HMM.

33:59.168 --> 34:00.739
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.511
I OWE HER.

34:02.511 --> 34:05.614
AS A MATTER OF FACT...

34:05.614 --> 34:07.516
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.451
(door opens)

34:13.621 --> 34:14.583
(closes door)

34:18.257 --> 34:20.228
(sighs)

34:22.531 --> 34:26.063
I FEEL LIKE I FAILED YOU.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.366
NOLAN, THERE WAS NO WAY

34:27.366 --> 34:28.437
I COULD'VE MADE IT THERE
ON TIME.

34:28.437 --> 34:30.339
IT WOULDN'T
HAVE MATTERED ANYWAY.

34:30.339 --> 34:32.501
THEY HAVE BEEN AHEAD OF US...

34:32.501 --> 34:36.545
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

34:36.545 --> 34:38.476
AND NOW...

34:38.476 --> 34:41.449
THEY'LL PROBABLY KILL HER,
IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY.

34:41.449 --> 34:46.083
AND I TOLD HER, EMS...

34:46.083 --> 34:48.617
I PROMISED HER
THAT I WOULD KEEP HER SAFE.

34:48.617 --> 34:51.489
NOLAN, LOOK AT ME.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.592
I DON'T KNOW
IF PADMA'S STILL ALIVE.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.426
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT IF SHE IS,

34:57.426 --> 34:59.097
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON
THAT CAN FIND HER.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.599
I SHOULD'VE LET AIDEN SHOOT.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.802
DON'T SAY THAT. DID YOU...
TRACK THE SOURCE OF THE TEXT?

35:03.802 --> 35:05.634
I TRIED.

35:05.634 --> 35:07.476
THE ENCRYPTION'S INSANE.

35:07.476 --> 35:09.578
IT'S GONNA TAKE WEEKS.

35:09.578 --> 35:10.879
WELL, THEN WE NEED TO
GET STARTED.

35:10.879 --> 35:13.582
LOOK AT ME. I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE HURTING,

35:13.582 --> 35:15.584
BUT YOU NEED
TO STOP BLAMING YOURSELF,

35:15.584 --> 35:18.587
GET ON YOUR COMPUTER,
AND DIG UNTIL YOU FIND THEM.

35:18.587 --> 35:20.689
AND I SWEAR TO GOD,
WHEN YOU DO,

35:20.689 --> 35:22.721
I WILL HELP YOU SAVE HER.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.793
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

35:24.793 --> 35:26.695
(cell phone rings)
 (huffs)

35:26.695 --> 35:27.856
(ring)

35:27.856 --> 35:29.598
UNBELIEVABLE.
 GO AHEAD.

35:29.598 --> 35:31.129
NO.
 YES.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.401
(ring)
 TAKE IT.

35:32.401 --> 35:33.902
(ring)
 I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

35:33.902 --> 35:36.705
(ring)

35:36.705 --> 35:39.738
(ring)

35:39.738 --> 35:40.909
(ring, beep)

35:40.909 --> 35:42.641
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO GO AWAY.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.743
NOT UNTIL YOU AND I
ARE SQUARE.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.576
(Meredith) Please...
 ELI, WHERE ARE YOU?

35:47.576 --> 35:50.519
(Meredith cries) IF YOU
LET ME OUT NOW, I PROMISE,

35:50.519 --> 35:52.451
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.
 What are you doing?

35:52.451 --> 35:55.184
GETTING YOUR LETTERS BACK
LIKE I PROMISED YOU.

35:55.184 --> 35:58.327
(Meredith crying)
 (beep)

36:07.236 --> 36:08.497
(vehicle approaches)

36:14.803 --> 36:16.645
(knock on door)

36:17.546 --> 36:18.907
(pen cap clicks)

36:25.714 --> 36:27.416
ANOTHER LETTER?

36:27.416 --> 36:28.557
NO.

36:28.557 --> 36:29.818
A CONFESSION.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.593
SHE SOLD THE LETTERS
TO SOME GUY YEARS AGO.

36:36.425 --> 36:37.826
IT'S ALL IN HERE.

36:40.969 --> 36:42.671
AND HAYWARD?

36:42.671 --> 36:44.873
SHE'LL LIVE.

36:44.873 --> 36:46.575
THE LESS YOU KNOW,
THE BETTER.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.584
YOU THINK YOU'LL...
EVER FORGIVE ME?

36:55.584 --> 36:59.288
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

37:00.649 --> 37:02.451
RIGHT.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.795
WELL, YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

37:06.795 --> 37:08.557
GOOD-BYE.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.231
ELI.

37:15.504 --> 37:18.567
THANK YOU.

37:33.482 --> 37:35.654
AH, MR. PORTER.

37:35.654 --> 37:36.785
AM I INTERRUPTING?

37:36.785 --> 37:38.927
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT AT ALL.

37:38.927 --> 37:40.559
MS. DAVENPORT
WAS JUST ABOUT TO EMBARK

37:40.559 --> 37:43.932
ON SOME DAMAGE CONTROL
FOR MY CAMPAIGN.

37:47.336 --> 37:48.697
NOW WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

37:48.697 --> 37:53.342
WELL, I'VE--I'VE GIVEN
SOME THOUGHT TO YOUR OFFER.

37:53.342 --> 37:54.673
AH.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.776
AND I ACCEPT.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.848
AND I'M DELIGHTED.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.550
AFTER YESTERDAY'S FIASCO,

38:01.550 --> 38:03.482
THERE'S NO ONE
I'D RATHER HAVE BESIDE ME

38:03.482 --> 38:04.983
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.517
WELCOME ABOARD.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.560
(typing rapidly)

38:11.560 --> 38:12.661
ANY LUCK?

38:12.661 --> 38:14.593
GETTING CLOSER.
THE TEXT WAS SPOOFED.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.865
(computer beeping)
 IT CAME FROM A COMPUTER,
NOT A PHONE,

38:16.865 --> 38:19.868
THEN WAS BOUNCED AROUND
THROUGH SEVERAL S.M.S. SERVERS.

38:19.868 --> 38:22.871
I AM JUST PULLING UP
THE HEADER DETAILS NOW.

38:22.871 --> 38:24.403
(bangs keys)

38:24.403 --> 38:27.436
LOOK. THERE IT IS AGAIN.

38:27.436 --> 38:29.007
FALCON'S SIGNATURE.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.410
THE FALCON'S WORKING
FOR THE INITIATIVE?

38:31.410 --> 38:33.512
WELL, THEY MUST HAVE
POACHED HIM FROM THE GRAYSONS

38:33.512 --> 38:34.843
AFTER HE HELPED FRAME
DAVID CLARKE.

38:34.843 --> 38:36.845
WHICH MEANS HE MAY HAVE ACCESS
TO EVERY TRANSACTION

38:36.845 --> 38:39.017
THE INITIATIVE OR THE GRAYSONS
HAVE EVER MADE.

38:39.017 --> 38:42.451
WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT
THE PEOPLE HOLDING PADMA

38:42.451 --> 38:44.353
MIGHT BE
DIGITALLY WALLED OFF

38:44.353 --> 38:45.824
BY THE ONE PERSON
ON THIS PLANET

38:45.824 --> 38:48.727
WHO MIGHT BE BETTER AT THIS
THAN I AM.
 (continues typing)

38:48.727 --> 38:50.599
(phone rings, line clicks, beep)

38:50.599 --> 38:53.101
You've reached Emily.
 Leave a message.
 (beep)

38:53.101 --> 38:54.863
MR. TAYLOR, DANIEL GRAYSON.

38:54.863 --> 38:57.035
I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP
ON OUR LUNCH MEETING.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.567
I'M SORRY, DANIEL.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.509
UH, THIS JUST CAME FOR YOU.
IT'S MARKED "URGENT."

39:00.509 --> 39:02.070
I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

39:02.070 --> 39:03.642
(clatter)
 THANK YOU.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.815
(telephone ringing
in distance)

39:26.665 --> 39:27.666
(clink)

39:45.814 --> 39:47.616
(door slams in distance)

39:47.616 --> 39:50.619
(indistinct conversations)

39:55.664 --> 39:57.526
What, no cake?

39:57.526 --> 40:01.029
You've been keeping
something from me, Mason.

40:01.029 --> 40:03.702
My guess is, you're not
referring to my recipe

40:03.702 --> 40:06.104
for brewed-in-the toilet
prison wine.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.937
I'm talking about
the letters from my father.

40:08.937 --> 40:11.610
THE ONES THAT YOU BOUGHT
FROM MEREDITH HAYWARD.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.882
(chuckles)
Hayward gave me up, did she?

40:13.882 --> 40:16.645
Give me the letters,
Mason.

40:16.645 --> 40:19.417
(huffs) Sadly, I cannot.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.750
Those letters were reduced
to smoke, my dear,

40:21.750 --> 40:23.652
along with everything else
I owned

40:23.652 --> 40:25.594
when you burned down
my house

40:25.594 --> 40:26.555
LAST SUMMER.

40:26.555 --> 40:28.627
You obviously read them

40:28.627 --> 40:29.758
SO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WROTE.

40:29.758 --> 40:31.460
Oh, I do.

40:31.460 --> 40:34.533
One of them was so revealing
that I suspect

40:34.533 --> 40:36.134
IT MIGHT EVEN BLOW YOUR MIND,
BUT TELL ME,

40:36.134 --> 40:37.666
what's in it for me?

40:37.666 --> 40:39.638
Do I
really need to remind you

40:39.638 --> 40:41.940
that only I have the power
to release you

40:41.940 --> 40:43.772
OR SEE TO IT
THAT YOU DIE IN THERE,

40:43.772 --> 40:46.775
JUST LIKE MY FATHER DID?

40:46.775 --> 40:48.647
And let's not forget
Mason,

40:48.647 --> 40:51.580
YOU NEED ME TO FINISH
YOUR NEW BOOK.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.453
Tell me what he wrote.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.887
He was worried about you
being in some kind of...

40:58.887 --> 41:00.959
Dickensian foster home,

41:00.959 --> 41:02.761
'CAUSE HE HAD WITNESSED
FIRSTHAND

41:02.761 --> 41:03.962
THE ANGUISH

41:03.962 --> 41:06.234
of another parent who...

41:06.234 --> 41:09.197
surrendered her firstborn son
to just such a facility

41:09.197 --> 41:10.869
many years ago.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.941
Who was he talking about?

41:12.941 --> 41:16.745
A very lonely, very frightened
16-year-old girl

41:16.745 --> 41:19.578
who would mature into someone
with whom he was very close

41:19.578 --> 41:21.880
after your mother...

41:21.880 --> 41:23.852
left you.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.616
Victoria.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.861
She has another son.

41:32.861 --> 41:35.824
I imagine you'll exploit
this fresh little morsel

41:35.824 --> 41:38.226
with your usual flair.

41:40.268 --> 41:42.270
You can't even begin
to imagine.
