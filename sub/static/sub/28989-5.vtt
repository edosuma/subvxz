WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:02.158
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.252 --> 00:05.244
Rachel and I were offered a
chance to run a firm in Seattle.

00:05.464 --> 00:08.125
It's a place that only takes cases
against Fortune 500 companies.

00:08.217 --> 00:09.958
If you want to do
more pro bono cases...

00:10.052 --> 00:12.009
That's not the point,
Harvey. This is who I am.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.551
Harvey gave his
clients to Eric?

00:13.639 --> 00:15.425
He did. But he still
has one more to give up.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.677
Brick Street
Athletics.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.849
Why?
He wanted to make a gesture.

00:18.936 --> 00:19.926
LOUIS: The dean
of a law school.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.309
There's no way you'll
be able to do both.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.809
I want this job, and I want a baby,
and I don't see why I can't have both.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.149
You betrayed me.
You betrayed this firm...

00:27.236 --> 00:28.351
I tried to hide it,
I swear.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.152
Get the hell out of
my firm. You are fired.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.736
FAYE: No, he's not.
This shows an utter

00:31.823 --> 00:32.813
lack of judgment.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.364
And I'm not
letting it stand.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.907
I can't work
here anymore.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.902
Brian, please don't do this.
It's gonna be okay.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.986
No, it's not.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.994
If you want me gone, convince me
you people can be trusted to fly right.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.119
And if
we don't?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.496
If you continue
to cross lines?

00:44.586 --> 00:45.701
Then you'll be fired.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.131
What do you mean,
"you can't come over tonight"?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.212
I got pizza.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.297
I even got those stupid
yellow tomatoes that you like.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.386
Harvey, something
came up last-minute.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.975
An old friend called
me out of the blue.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.473
Well, then, why don't
you come by later?

01:04.355 --> 01:05.596
I could reheat the pizza.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.898
It'll be 40% worse,
but it's okay.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.317
Why do I get the feeling
that this isn't about pizza?

01:10.612 --> 01:12.649
All right, look, it's not
something I advertise,

01:12.739 --> 01:14.446
but I watch Survivor.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.448
You watch Survivor?
I do.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.991
You shouldn't
admit that.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.614
It's an underrated show
but I love it,

01:19.830 --> 01:21.366
and I was hoping
to get you into it.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.663
Okay, then what do you say
I take a rain check?

01:23.834 --> 01:25.370
All right, but
it's under protest.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.618
Who's this old friend,
anyway? Survivor?

01:27.713 --> 01:29.829
What are you, 1,0007?
I get it.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.127
The plans weren't for
you, they were for me.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.874
Have a great time, Harvey.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.425
You know, just because she gave you
a key doesn't mean you're staying here.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.472
Why would I stay here?
I've got my old apartment

01:40.559 --> 01:42.425
that you're pretending
to rent for me.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.311
"Rick Sorkin"?
You've gone soft.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.637
I was using it
as a tax shelter.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.144
And what's the name of that
tax shelter? "I'm A Softie"?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.645
Maybe I've always
been a softie.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.194
What happened to,
"caring makes you weak"?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.988
I think you're confusing
"caring" with "moving to Seattle."

01:56.450 --> 01:58.691
Speaking of Seattle, don't
you have some old ladies

01:58.785 --> 02:01.117
looking to sue
the condo association,

02:01.204 --> 02:02.786
or whatever big case
you've got going these days?

02:02.873 --> 02:05.240
Yes, I do, but those ladies
are gonna have to wait,

02:05.334 --> 02:07.575
because I always have time
for an old friend.

02:08.794 --> 02:09.910
(CHUCKLES)

02:10.088 --> 02:12.705
It's good to see you, Harvey.
Great to see you, Mike.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.041
Is that Gionno's?
It is.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.960
You like yellow tomatoes?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.424
LOUIS: And should the
slipper fit, I will know thee

02:20.515 --> 02:23.803
to be yon fair maiden who
so enchanted me at the ball.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.678
But, my prince, I
am not worthy of you.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.980
Not in these
dirty clothes.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.606
You're mistaken,

02:31.818 --> 02:34.185
for it is your dirtiness
that so attracts me.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.400
(STRAINS)

02:37.741 --> 02:40.028
Is something wrong,
my Lord? No, my Lady.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.442
It's just...

02:42.245 --> 02:44.361
It's just...
Maybe if I...

02:44.456 --> 02:46.367
Shit, it doesn't fit,
does it?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.166
Of course it fits.
You're my princess.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.334
No, I'm the
fat step-sister.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.295
What... Sheila,
don't say that.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.668
You're just retaining
a little extra water.

02:54.758 --> 02:55.748
"Water"?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.708
Louis, my foot's
the size of Wisconsin.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.964
And no one's arguing that,

02:59.096 --> 03:00.757
but once you have the baby
it will shrink right back down.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.758
No, it won't.
What are you talking about?

03:02.849 --> 03:04.305
Louis, if your feet grow
when you're pregnant,

03:04.393 --> 03:05.975
they don't get
smaller again.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.931
But these were $9,000.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.637
That's what
you're upset about?

03:09.815 --> 03:11.397
Well, what the hell else
would I be upset about?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.562
You know what, maybe I'm
the one who should be upset

03:13.777 --> 03:16.064
because I'm fat
and stupid

03:16.154 --> 03:19.237
and just cost us a lot of money
and I can't do anything right!

03:19.324 --> 03:22.533
Oh, Sheila.
You do everything right.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.406
(SOBBING) No, I don't.
What's going on?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.488
Okay, I tried not
to think about it,

03:27.874 --> 03:29.831
but I spent an entire
meeting this morning

03:29.918 --> 03:33.331
calling one of our most
important donors the wrong name.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.003
He pulled
his donation.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.504
$50,000.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.581
Hey, hey.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.795
It's okay.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.379
It's just one donor. No,
it's not just one donor.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.597
It's everything!

03:45.976 --> 03:48.638
And I'm so tired
and so foggy.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.348
Yeah, because
you're pregnant.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.729
And if I can't do my job
when I'm pregnant,

03:52.816 --> 03:54.432
why should anyone think
I'll be able to do it

03:54.526 --> 03:55.561
when I have a baby?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.643
Sheila, you are being
way too hard on yourself.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.524
No, you just don't get it,

03:59.614 --> 04:01.480
so just leave
me alone!

04:04.369 --> 04:06.656
Let me get this straight,
I tell Donna to kiss you,

04:06.747 --> 04:09.364
she does, and then,
as a result,

04:09.624 --> 04:11.911
you ask another woman
to move in with you.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.042
It was a
complicated situation.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.712
Must have been, because
then Donna starts dating a client,

04:16.798 --> 04:18.380
breaks privilege for him,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.211
and then you two
end up together.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.588
Didn't we already discuss
this on the phone

04:21.678 --> 04:23.009
like a month ago?
Yeah,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.837
well, if it had been on
FaceTime, I'd let it go,

04:24.931 --> 04:27.719
but a real friend needs to
enjoy the shame in person.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.800
Well, while you're
doing that, let's have it.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.472
Have what?
Why you're really here.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.727
"Cause I'm not buying

04:32.814 --> 04:34.396
you showed up unannounced
without a reason.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.099
If you really must know,
I'm here on business.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.850
The business of begging
for your old job back?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.855
Because it's too late.
We've replaced you.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.232
Yeah, but do they
have a law degree?

04:41.323 --> 04:43.781
Shit, I knew there was
something I forgot to check.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.279
If you had my memory, you
wouldn't forget things like that.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.701
No, I'd just forget to lock
my briefcase full of weed.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.867
The lock was broken.
Your brain is broken.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.989
(LAUGHS)

04:52.167 --> 04:53.157
Come on, give it to me.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.707
Who's the asshole
you're going up against?

04:54.795 --> 04:55.785
Actually, I think you
know him pretty well.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.961
His name
is Harvey Sphincter.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.915
He plays it real tight.
You gotta be kidding me.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.467
A five-hour flight and all you
came up with was "sphincter"?

05:03.720 --> 05:06.087
I stand by sphincter. But
you want something better?

05:06.348 --> 05:07.429
How about this.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.219
I represent Jeremy Wall,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.392
and he wants out of his
contract with Brick Street.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.852
Wait a second, "out"?

05:14.064 --> 05:16.556
Mmm-hmm, Jeremy's deal
stipulates they do no harm to his image,

05:16.650 --> 05:19.893
and exploiting overseas
workers is textbook harm.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.193
Exploiting its workers?
Where's he getting that idea?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.321
He went on a goodwill trip.
He saw the factory himself.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.738
Well, if you want me
to sell them on this,

05:26.117 --> 05:27.403
he's gonna have to give
them their money back.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.986
He's not giving back a dime.
He's not walking for free.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.616
I figured
you might say that,

05:31.706 --> 05:34.073
so I brought
a little incentive.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.955
Breach of contract.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.911
I see what this is.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.038
You don't want me
to convince Brick Street.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.505
You wanna take me on.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.583
I take you on, kick your ass.
I mean, what's the difference?

05:44.970 --> 05:47.712
Well, in that case, why don't
you and Jeremy pop by tomorrow?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.594
And by "pop by,"
I mean sit for a deposition.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.674
Are you sure?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.884
You're not worried about
losing to a lawyer in his prime?

05:53.979 --> 05:54.969
I hate to break
it to you, Mike,

05:55.063 --> 05:57.179
but I was in my prime
before you were born,

05:57.357 --> 05:59.769
and I'll be in it long after
you're dead.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.442
You know that
doesn't make sense, right?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.144
It will when
you're in your prime.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.811
Then I guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.778
And Harvey, to put this in a
way that you might understand,

06:09.035 --> 06:10.571
if this ends up
going to a jury

06:10.662 --> 06:14.371
like they do in Survivor,
I'll be the last man standing.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.000
I knew he watched Survivor.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.957
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

06:24.050 --> 06:27.259
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

06:27.512 --> 06:30.880
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

06:30.974 --> 06:34.012
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

06:34.102 --> 06:37.436
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

06:37.522 --> 06:39.354
Me and missy is so early

06:39.441 --> 06:41.057
Busy, busy making money

06:41.151 --> 06:42.141
All right!

06:42.736 --> 06:46.320
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

06:48.700 --> 06:50.441
The greenback boogie

06:52.954 --> 06:55.742
Alex, just the man
I wanted to see.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.494
Um...

06:58.960 --> 07:02.203
You survived two pregnancies
with Rosalie, right?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.461
Yes, I did. Why?

07:03.548 --> 07:04.629
How'd you do it?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.081
Right now I can't
do anything right.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.340
No matter what I say,

07:07.427 --> 07:08.758
no matter what I do,
it upsets her.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.965
And I have read every book
that I can get my hands on,

07:11.139 --> 07:13.130
but none of them talk about

07:14.017 --> 07:15.507
(WHISPERS)
her being crazy.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.308
Louis, why did you
whisper that?

07:17.479 --> 07:18.469
I don't know.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.553
(LAUGHS)

07:19.648 --> 07:20.638
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
What is so funny?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.063
I'm thinking about
how fucked you are.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.892
God damn it, Alex, I
have no one else to turn to.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.143
Brian left,

07:26.237 --> 07:27.648
if Harvey has children,
he doesn't know about them,

07:27.739 --> 07:29.070
and if you think
I'm gonna ask my sister

07:29.157 --> 07:30.522
you're out
of your goddamn mind.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.780
All right, listen, the answer
to your problem is simple.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.861
Just do nothing.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.072
What are you talking about?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.032
Whatever's upsetting her,
don't try to solve it.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.076
Don't tell her
it's gonna be okay.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.582
Just listen
and do nothing.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.004
Nothing.
That's right, nothing.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.418
Not even... What about...
Nope. Uh-uh.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.915
Surely I can... Louis,
the reason I was laughing

07:49.010 --> 07:51.251
was because I know you're
incapable of doing nothing,

07:51.346 --> 07:54.429
so if you must do something,
and I don't recommend this,

07:54.808 --> 07:55.798
just tell her you love her.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.474
I tried that. She threw
a shoe in my face.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.472
So you feel me now?

08:00.605 --> 08:01.811
Yeah, I do.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.222
Thank you, Alex.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.063
I'm going to go ahead
and do nothing.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.357
He's totally fucked.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.737
Good morning, Katrina.
Donna, what can I do for you?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.117
I want to thank you for

08:19.207 --> 08:21.073
protecting my vote with that
code of conduct.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.375
It was nothing.
It was something,

08:24.421 --> 08:25.832
and I wanna
return the favor.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.587
What are you talking about?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.547
I'm talking about Brian.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.000
Katrina, you haven't picked
a new associate

08:32.095 --> 08:33.506
and you haven't seemed
like yourself lately,

08:33.596 --> 08:35.587
and it makes me think
that you haven't moved on.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.056
Well, I appreciate
your concern, but I have.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.682
Well, how about you
give him a call right now?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.977
See? Even the thought of it
makes you uncomfortable.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.397
Okay, you're right. I haven't
picked a new associate.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.687
And with everything
that's been going on,

08:48.778 --> 08:51.395
you can hardly blame me
for not seeming like myself.

08:51.614 --> 08:55.608
But as far as Brian goes,
I'm doing just fine.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.155
I understand.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.080
And if you change your mind and
you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.788
Benjamin, do you
have a second?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.999
Actually, Louis, I don't.
I'm a little busy right now.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.959
Unless you want
to fire me again.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.295
Okay, I get it. You are
still upset about that.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.595
"Upset"?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.423
You asked me to do
something shady for you,

09:19.517 --> 09:20.598
and then
when I got caught,

09:20.685 --> 09:22.517
instead of standing
up for me, you fired me.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.641
And on top of all of that,
you don't even show your face

09:24.731 --> 09:26.267
until you need something,
which is obvious

09:26.441 --> 09:28.227
by that greasy bag of
delicious bacon in your hand.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.685
Well, bacon is not gonna solve
your problem this time, a-hole.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.066
Benjamin, I know
I have not been here,

09:33.156 --> 09:35.488
and all I can say about
that is, I am ashamed.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.399
You wanna know how to
make that shame go away?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.944
How about saying, "I
was wrong and I'm sorry"?

09:40.121 --> 09:42.408
I was wrong,
and I am sorry.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.199
And I am not just saying that
because I need your help.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.326
But you are saying it
when you need help.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.623
I am.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.961
And if you don't wanna help,
you don't have to.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.959
But it's not for me,
it's for Sheila.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.383
Sheila?
She lost a huge donor.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.506
She feels horrible,
and the only way I can think

09:56.596 --> 09:58.837
of making the mother
of my unborn child feel better

09:59.224 --> 10:01.135
is to replace
his contribution.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.217
How much?
$50,000.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.853
Okay, well, if you are willing
to part with that much money

10:06.940 --> 10:08.647
to make Sheila
feel better, I'll help.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.144
What do you need?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.775
I need you to run a proxy
through a financial institution

10:12.862 --> 10:14.773
to create the appearance
of an anonymous donation

10:14.864 --> 10:16.195
from a tax-sheltered company.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.281
All right, I am doing
this for Sheila

10:18.535 --> 10:20.025
and I will require
the bacon,

10:20.203 --> 10:23.161
but that is the most romantic
thing I've ever heard in my life.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.491
Thank you.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.877
(INHALES DEEPLY)

10:32.882 --> 10:33.872
Harvey?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.128
Samantha, I was just
gonna come see you.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.708
No, you weren't.
You know how I know that?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.885
Because my new client,
the one you gave me,

10:38.972 --> 10:41.088
was served with a lawsuit
at your condo last night

10:41.182 --> 10:42.764
and you didn't
tell me about it.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.137
You heard about
Brick Street already?

10:44.227 --> 10:45.843
Did you think I wouldn't?
Well, it's possible.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.306
You sometimes box
in the mornings.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.478
Harvey...
Samantha,

10:48.565 --> 10:49.726
I'm not trying
to take them back.

10:49.816 --> 10:50.806
It's just
a little complicated.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.686
What exactly is
complicated about it?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.477
Hey, Jeremy's here.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.737
Ready to go
do this deposition?

10:56.990 --> 10:57.980
"Jeremy"?

10:58.575 --> 10:59.565
Let me get
this straight,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.400
not only did you take my
client without telling me,

11:01.494 --> 11:03.326
you scheduled a deposition
with the other side?

11:03.413 --> 11:06.496
Wait, her client?
Mike, meet Samantha Wheeler.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.324
I gave her Brick Street
about a month ago.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.534
I might have forgotten to
mention that to you last night.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.211
Samantha,
meet Mike Ross.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.334
Hmm. The protégé.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.756
Okay, why did she
just say it like that?

11:16.843 --> 11:19.835
If I had to take a guess, it's
because she thought you'd be taller.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.216
I'm the same height as you.
The lies we tell ourselves.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.591
It's because I'm less concerned
with meeting you than kicking your ass,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.143
since I'm the one you're gonna
be going up against, not him.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.182
Hang on, I didn't agree...
Harvey, if I may?

11:31.149 --> 11:33.607
Look, Samantha, I get it.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.893
I've been where you are
right now a hundred times.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.274
It's so frustrating,
but I think we all know

11:38.364 --> 11:40.105
Harvey's gonna take
this client back

11:40.200 --> 11:42.316
whether you like it or not,
So you might as well

11:42.410 --> 11:43.696
just let him do it.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.776
(CHUCKLES)

11:44.996 --> 11:45.986
That's about as naive

11:46.080 --> 11:48.492
as hoping we'll let Jeremy
Wall out of his contract.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.073
Well, this isn't
really about hope.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.909
It's about Brick Street
doing right by its workers.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.461
And if you think that sob story is
gonna work here, you're wrong.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.996
Sob stories
are his specialty.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.457
I prefer to call it "appealing
to a jury's humanity."

11:58.551 --> 12:00.918
Well, I call it "bringing a
violin to a gun fight."

12:01.137 --> 12:03.128
Well, we'll see what
you call it when I'm done.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.217
Anyway, I'll give you two
a minute to discuss

12:05.308 --> 12:06.719
who's gonna take the loss.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.307
Your protege
IS a douche.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.143
Not gonna argue
with you there.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.521
Then how about not arguing
over whose client this is?

12:16.778 --> 12:18.394
Because I got
a deposition to get to.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.569
You don't even
know this case.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.522
I know the client,
I know the contract...

12:21.616 --> 12:23.948
And I know the man.
You think I can't beat him?

12:24.035 --> 12:25.776
Samantha, he used
to be my guy.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.828
He travelled across the
country to pick a fight with me.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.452
He's never gonna let me
live it down if I duck him.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.285
Then we're doing this together,
because this is my client.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.916
I'm not just handing
them over to you.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.627
Okay, but don't
underestimate him.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.501
Whatever else Mike Ross is,

12:42.595 --> 12:44.552
he's just as good
as you or me.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.312
This is stupid.
You're over him,

12:54.399 --> 12:56.185
and someone
who is over someone

12:56.276 --> 12:58.233
should be able
to call them as a friend.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.518
(SIGHS)

13:00.655 --> 13:02.111
VOICEMAIL: Hey, you've reached
Brian Altman.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.030
Please leave a message
and have a great day.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.733
Hey, Brian.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.991
Just calling because you came
up in conversation today.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.246
Apropos of nothing.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.200
We certainly weren't talking
about how I'm still not over you.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.252
Oh, Sweet Lord,
I just made it worse.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.172
What do I do? What do I...

13:21.259 --> 13:23.591
If you are satisfied with your
message, please press one.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.168
To rerecord, press two.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.587
Thank God.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.968
Hey, Brian. It's your buddy.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.599
Your friend
with a capital

13:35.898 --> 13:37.354
Your F-buddy.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.609
Hi, Katrina, it's Brian. Shit.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.902
B-dawg, it's Kitty Kat.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.401
What? Who are you?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.482
Nope. Ass.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.988
Damn it. Ball sack!

13:49.078 --> 13:50.739
Fuck. Mother of pearl!

13:50.872 --> 13:53.239
Just tell her you love me
and that it's over!

13:53.541 --> 13:54.997
That felt good.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.960
Hello, Brian. Today you came
up in a work-related discussion,

13:59.047 --> 14:01.630
and I wanted to see if
there were any bespoke files

14:02.008 --> 14:03.544
you had not yet received.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.917
Cordially, Katrina Bennett.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.432
SAMANTHA: Mr. Wall, you claim to
have seen objectionable factory conditions.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.805
I'm not claiming anything.
I saw them.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.765
Those people
are miserable.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.731
And misery isn't a
violation of international law.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.649
Are they violating
international law?

14:21.736 --> 14:22.897
I don't know.
No, you don't,

14:23.154 --> 14:25.441
because you're a basketball
player. You're not a lawyer.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.613
That doesn't mean I can't tell
when something's not right.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.442
And when exactly did you start
thinking something wasn't right?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.493
When I visited that factory
six months ago.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.114
And yet, you're only
bringing this up now? Why?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.915
Because, like, you said,
I'm a basketball player.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.117
I didn't know what to do
or who to go to.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.874
No, you were afraid you
wouldn't be paid your full contract.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.292
MIKE: Don't talk
to my client like that.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.794
And you can't speak
to his motivations.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.591
I don't care
about his motivations.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.384
What I want to know
is why he lied

14:48.471 --> 14:51.714
about being contacted by
an activist named Charles Hu.

14:51.808 --> 14:52.969
I didn't lie
about anything.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.016
HARVEY: You said you
didn't care about the conditions

14:55.103 --> 14:56.184
until six months ago.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.853
He wrote you 18 months ago.
Sounds like a lie to me.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.227
That letter got me
a little concerned,

15:01.317 --> 15:04.184
but I didn't take it seriously
until I saw the conditions myself.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.814
And what you need
to take seriously

15:05.947 --> 15:08.860
is that you had one year
to blow the whistle,

15:08.950 --> 15:10.156
and you are
six months too late.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.529
Bullshit, that letter
was unsolicited.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.280
It didn't trigger
his awareness.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.738
He just said it did.
He used the word "concern."

15:15.832 --> 15:17.072
This is a technicality.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.658
No, Mike, it's the terms
of his contract.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.584
I think this case
is getting dismissed.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.083
MIKE: So you're really
gonna do this?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.039
Mike, it's there
in black and white.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.125
I don't care what's
in black and white.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.586
He found out about the
conditions six months ago, not 18.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.795
It's not a violation.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.721
Well, you're gonna have
to explain that to a judge.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.091
And even if you're
successful, he'll be on record

15:36.185 --> 15:39.303
saying he didn't give a shit about
those people for an entire year.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.559
Harvey, they're exploiting
these people and you know it.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.807
What I know is,
you're the same old Mike

15:43.943 --> 15:45.525
playing that violin
to get me to help you.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.195
I might be the same old Mike, but
you are not the same old Harvey.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.447
What'd you just say?
You heard me.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.358
That's why you did this now.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.451
You know Faye's
breathing down our necks,

15:55.705 --> 15:57.070
and I can't fight
at full strength.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.623
That's one way to put it.
Another is that her being here

15:59.709 --> 16:01.791
might actually make you
fight fair for a change.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.125
You saying
you're gonna fight fair?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.919
All of my bad habits
I learned from you.

16:05.006 --> 16:08.499
I don't care what rules we play by as
long as we're playing by the same ones.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.126
So, how fair do you
want this fight to be?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.336
Anything that could get us
disbarred or put in prison is off-limits.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.838
You're still
afraid of prison?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.390
Frank Gallo's dead.
Harvey, I'm serious.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.518
All right, you got
yourself a deal.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.643
But one thing, no crying
in your coffee.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.940
We end this thing on good
terms no matter who wins.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.142
You got it.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.944
I'll make sure to accept
your loss gracefully.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.079
You were right.
I'm not over him.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.328
Dare I ask how exactly
you came to this conclusion?

16:42.418 --> 16:43.533
I called him.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.960
Oh, no.
It was a disaster, Donna.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.629
I had to redo
a million messages.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.831
I started out
calling him Katrina.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.957
Oh, dear.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.714
My F-buddy.
That's worse.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.964
I finally had to write a script
for myself just to get out of it.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.682
Is that it?

17:00.269 --> 17:01.634
But I can't relive
the rest of it.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.719
And I won't make you,

17:02.813 --> 17:04.429
at least not until you
have a martini in you,

17:04.523 --> 17:06.891
which by my calculations
should be in about five hours.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.646
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.726
I am.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.397
You and I are hitting
the town tonight.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.730
Donna, that's a great idea.
Thank you.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.361
Shit.
Is everything okay?

17:16.953 --> 17:17.988
Um...

17:19.163 --> 17:21.244
It will be. I just need to figure out
how I'm gonna handle something.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.203
I'll meet you
in the lobby at 7:00.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.505
There she is.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.467
The wonderful, beautiful
love of my life.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.544
What is this?

17:35.638 --> 17:37.128
Took the afternoon off,
did some shoe shopping.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.593
New glass slippers
for my princess.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.642
Louis, that is so sweet,
but you didn't need to.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.429
You're not gonna
believe this,

17:45.648 --> 17:48.857
but an anonymous
$50,000 donation

17:48.943 --> 17:51.105
came in this morning.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.397
That is fantastic.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.526
I am popping the
sparkling cider right now.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.944
And while you're at it,
why don't you take these

17:57.034 --> 17:59.196
anonymous glass slippers
and shove them up your ass.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.485
What now?
Is that the phone?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.945
Save it, Louis.
I know it was you.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.868
Anonymous donations
don't come in anonymously.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.245
They just tell me
to keep their name out.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.825
Well, then that's just
false advertising.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.831
Damn it, Louis, how
could you do this to me?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.412
"To you"? I was
doing it for you.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.669
When I saw how upset you were
I just couldn't stand it.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.591
I told you to leave me alone,

18:15.678 --> 18:19.262
and instead, you showed me you
think I'm incapable of doing my job.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.430
Sheila, I spent $50,000.
I don't care.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.100
It was selfish and cruel...
Okay, you know what?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.551
I have been trying
to get it right,

18:25.646 --> 18:27.728
but no matter what I do you
just keep biting my head off.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.601
That's because
you never just listen.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.354
And the last time I listened, you
said, "Why aren't you saying anything?"

18:32.486 --> 18:34.318
And now I'm saying,
how could you not think about

18:34.405 --> 18:35.691
how this would make me feel?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.694
All I have been thinking
about is how you feel.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.484
And I have been walking on
eggshells this whole time

18:41.579 --> 18:43.786
trying not to set off
the pregnant woman who...

18:43.873 --> 18:45.363
Yes!
So now I'm crazy.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.790
Well, then, maybe I should
just check myself into a nuthouse

18:47.877 --> 18:49.413
and stop making
your life so miserable.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.335
No, Sheila, wait.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.757
Maybe we both need to check
ourselves into a nuthouse.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.379
What are you talking about?
Lipschitz.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.753
I'm talking about
us seeing Stan.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.008
How is that going to help?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.759
He hasn't made you
any less insane.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.132
Yes, he has.
You know he has.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.055
So what do you say
we give it a try?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.228
Because, Sheila,
I don't know what else to do.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.479
(SIGHS) I'm sorry, Donna. I am
right in the middle of something.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.776
And I'm on my way to meet
Katrina, but this can't wait.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.322
Where did you get this?

19:20.409 --> 19:21.774
The Journal's
online edition.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.067
Goddamn Mike Ross.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.573
It'll be on
the front page tomorrow.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.371
Well, he's not
getting away with it.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.366
That's the thing, Samantha.
What if he does?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.246
Are you asking me
to let him tell the world

19:31.337 --> 19:32.919
our client exploits people?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.837
I'm asking you to cut a deal.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.668
Samantha, you can
still find a compromise.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.217
Why would I want to do that?
Because Mike Ross is family.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.260
He's not my family.
Yes, he is.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.383
He's Robert's family,
and so are you.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.839
Donna, I can't sell out
our clients

19:44.934 --> 19:46.800
just because Mike
married Robert's daughter.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.352
I didn't say "sell out,"
I said "compromise."

19:49.647 --> 19:51.012
And if you won't do it
because he's family,

19:51.107 --> 19:53.519
then do it because this ad
is just the beginning.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.480
I am telling you, he is
just like you and Harvey.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.981
He will never stop,

19:58.072 --> 20:00.404
and if you can't come up
with a win-win,

20:00.491 --> 20:03.404
then I guarantee you, we
will end up with a lose-lose.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.798
The thing is, I didn't
mean to fall for Brian.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.467
I was just so comfortable
around him.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.509
Of course, you were
at work in your element.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.880
Have another.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.093
Ooh. (SHUDDERS)

20:30.187 --> 20:31.769
Katrina, the way
to get over Brian

20:31.856 --> 20:34.723
is to stop dwelling on him
and start having some fun.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.516
What do you mean, "fun"?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.567
I mean, before Rachel
was with Mike,

20:38.654 --> 20:40.520
we used to go out
and assume the identities

20:40.614 --> 20:42.605
of Harriet Specter
and Michelle Ross,

20:42.700 --> 20:45.488
and we would convince
unsuspecting yet handsome men

20:45.578 --> 20:46.568
to buy us drinks.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.573
You mean, you defrauded
the public?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.120
That's exactly what I mean.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.744
And if I'm not mistaken,

20:51.834 --> 20:53.871
I think Louise Litt
is still up for grabs.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.711
So what do you say we go flank
that 6'2" hunk of gorgeous?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.001
Donna, I'm not...
Copy that, too handsome.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.716
What about Tom Hanks
over at five o'clock?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.292
No, you're not...
Got it.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.718
He might as well
be Brian's brother.

21:04.805 --> 21:05.840
What about...

21:05.931 --> 21:08.343
Damn it, Donna,
I don't want anyone.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.140
Katrina, what's going on?

21:10.227 --> 21:12.434
I thought you wanted to
talk about how I was feeling,

21:12.563 --> 21:15.555
not try to make me party
my way out of this.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.639
Katrina, wait.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.105
When's the last time you
were in a real relationship?

21:21.030 --> 21:23.237
I don't feel comfortable
talking about that with you.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.903
In other words, you've only
been in one real relationship,

21:25.993 --> 21:27.449
and you broke
both your hearts

21:27.536 --> 21:29.118
because you didn't want
anything to get in the way

21:29.205 --> 21:31.446
of your career,
and I must be losing it

21:31.540 --> 21:33.451
because I completely
misread the situation.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.782
What do you mean?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.790
Brian was your soul's way of telling
you that there's more to life than work,

21:37.880 --> 21:42.465
and the person that you need to
develop a relationship with is you.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.962
How am I supposed to do that?

21:44.053 --> 21:46.590
You are gonna
start by promising me

21:46.680 --> 21:47.886
that one night a week
you're gonna do something

21:47.973 --> 21:49.384
that's just for you.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.886
I don't care
if it's a cooking class

21:50.976 --> 21:54.139
or origami or just curling up
with your favorite book,

21:54.230 --> 21:57.063
as long as it has nothing
to do with work.

21:57.608 --> 21:58.814
Or origami.
(CHUCKLES)

22:00.694 --> 22:02.059
I promise.

22:02.196 --> 22:05.655
And I'm going to start tonight
by having drinks with a friend.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.402
That's what
I'm talking about.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.744
You're not Harvey.
And you're not Jeremy Wall.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.663
But you took an ad out in
his name defaming my client.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.915
Are you here to shoot me?

22:20.005 --> 22:21.666
I'm here to negotiate
with you.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.918
Then come on in.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.050
We took out that ad

22:26.136 --> 22:27.843
because Brick Street
is exploiting its workers,

22:27.930 --> 22:29.386
and we have every
right to say so.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.679
Then let's get to it.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.006
What's it gonna take
to make it all go away?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.258
It's simple.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.850
You stop making clothes
the way you do

22:34.937 --> 22:37.053
or you let Jeremy out of his
contract with full pay.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.479
Of course, you could do both,
but I'm a realist.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.935
Look, Mike, I am trying
to find some common ground.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.564
I've known your
father-in-law forever,

22:44.655 --> 22:46.020
your wife since
she was a little girl.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.651
Well, who's playing
the violin now?

22:47.741 --> 22:49.277
Do you really expect me
to start tearing up

22:49.368 --> 22:50.984
because you used
to babysit Rachel?

22:51.078 --> 22:52.284
"Babysit her"?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.821
I saved her father
from going to prison.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.030
And what does
that have to do

22:56.125 --> 22:57.832
with the way your clients
treat its people?

22:57.918 --> 22:59.625
You want the truth?
Nothing.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.670
The only reason I'm here talking to
you is because Donna begged me to.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.996
Well, I don't really care
what Donna did.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.048
I'm not handing Harvey a win,
and I'm certainly not

23:06.135 --> 23:08.172
handing one
to his new second fiddle.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.133
You're not handing
anything to anybody

23:11.223 --> 23:13.464
because I have you and
your client dead to rights.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.550
You're lucky I don't come
after you for slander.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.602
Let me guess, this is the part where
you slap me with a defamation suit.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.556
Well, I happen to have
one right here.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.106
Well, then, you might as well
hand over that suit,

23:23.193 --> 23:24.479
because I'm not
changing the offer

23:24.570 --> 23:26.060
and we are definitely not
pulling that ad.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.198
Faye, can I help you?

23:35.289 --> 23:36.779
I hope so.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.332
I was wondering what you
could tell me about Mike Ross.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.705
Easy, he's cocky, arrogant,

23:41.879 --> 23:43.290
thinks he's the smartest guy
in the room.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.163
And he's had my back
more than once,

23:45.299 --> 23:46.755
so why don't you tell me
what you're doing here?

23:46.842 --> 23:49.083
I'm here because Harvey
and Mr. Ross have history,

23:49.261 --> 23:51.172
and when people have history,

23:51.472 --> 23:53.383
they tend to do things
they shouldn't.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.468
Not to mention
Samantha's now involved.

23:55.559 --> 23:57.049
You've gotta be shitting me.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.222
That's why you came in
all hat in hand?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.895
You want me to spy on them.
Not spy, oversee.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.643
Well, my answer's the same
either way.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.770
I'm not a snitch
and I'm not a damn babysitter.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.192
And I didn't come
hat in hand.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.108
I came with respect, because
you're the only name partner

24:10.199 --> 24:11.781
in this place that
hasn't come at me.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.403
You want people
to stop coming at you, Faye,

24:13.494 --> 24:15.155
stop doing shit where
you show you don't trust us

24:15.245 --> 24:16.531
and we can't trust you.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.871
You don't want to do this,
don't do it,

24:18.999 --> 24:21.912
but there's a powder keg here
and I'm the only one trying

24:22.002 --> 24:23.367
to keep it from exploding.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.500
Harvey, good.
The deposition is tomorrow...

24:30.636 --> 24:32.343
Did you go see Mike
behind my back?

24:32.596 --> 24:34.178
Yes, I did, but...
Why?

24:34.390 --> 24:37.007
Because Donna practically begged
me to work things out with him.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.843
Samantha, I didn't take this
case to lay down. I took it to win.

24:39.937 --> 24:40.972
Then what are you getting
so worked up about?

24:41.063 --> 24:43.851
Because I didn't lay down. I slapped
them both with a defamation suit,

24:43.941 --> 24:46.057
which is exactly what you would
have done if you had seen that ad.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.357
It isn't what
I would have done

24:47.444 --> 24:49.105
because I told you,
I know him,

24:49.196 --> 24:52.405
and he didn't fly all the way out
here just to get slapped with a suit

24:52.491 --> 24:54.027
he could have seen
coming a mile away.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.201
You know what, I'm getting a little tired
of you telling me I can't handle this kid.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.619
Well, that's too bad,
because until you filed the suit

24:59.707 --> 25:02.449
the only questions they could
ask were about Jeremy's contract.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.327
Now, they get to ask about
our manufacturing conditions.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.627
And that doesn't matter

25:06.755 --> 25:08.996
because we didn't do
anything wrong. Don't you get it?

25:09.091 --> 25:10.673
We don't have to have done
anything wrong.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.966
He just has to make it
look that way to a jury.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.885
Shit.
That's right.

25:15.097 --> 25:18.180
So you and I are gonna stay
here for as long as it takes

25:18.267 --> 25:20.099
to figure out how
to get out of this.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.723
Wait a second.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.852
If his goal is to play his
violin in front of a jury,

25:26.942 --> 25:30.310
all we have to do is make sure
they never get to hear it.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.530
Mind if the enemy stops in?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.907
I do, but you're
not the enemy.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.955
I guess you haven't heard
about me and Harvey, then.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.000
I've heard, but I stand
by my statement.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.040
How have you been?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.211
How's Rachel?
Good.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.461
In fact, if I told you how good,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.716
Please tell her I
said hello. I will.

25:55.137 --> 25:58.505
Speaking of good,
check out this office.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.841
Shit.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.306
What's the matter?
Nothing. It's just,

26:08.901 --> 26:11.734
you should have been
senior partner first, not me.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.358
Katrina, I am exactly
where I want to be.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.611
I'll let you
get back to work.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.113
Mike, I know
it's not my business,

26:23.207 --> 26:25.494
but Samantha is
an excellent lawyer,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.871
and deep down,
she's a good person.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.253
But?
Don't push her.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.126
I'm not trying
to do anything to her.

26:33.634 --> 26:34.669
This is between me and Harvey.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.377
As far as I'm concerned,
she's just along for the ride.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.382
That's the thing
about Samantha.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.219
She's never just
along for the ride.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.147
Coming to beg for mercy
before I rip your guy apart?

26:50.484 --> 26:54.899
No, I'm coming to give formal notice
of our decision to waive a jury trial.

26:54.988 --> 26:55.978
What?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.109
I'll use tiny words
so you'll understand.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.067
This case is going to a
judge and only a judge.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.492
This is bullshit.

27:02.579 --> 27:04.741
What's bullshit is you're
gonna make it seem like

27:04.873 --> 27:07.410
my client exploits his workers.
That's because he does.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.284
Those working conditions
are miserable.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.291
And that's exactly the kind of sob
story you were gonna play for a jury.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.081
Well, we took that bullet
out of your chamber,

27:15.384 --> 27:17.000
so why don't we
call this off

27:17.094 --> 27:19.335
and you don't have to
embarrass yourself in there?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.136
No, we're not
calling anything off

27:21.431 --> 27:23.092
because while a jury
might never hear it,

27:23.225 --> 27:25.592
I'm gonna make that motherfucker
answer for what he's doing.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.603
MIKE: Mr. Haskins, how many
people work in your factories in China?

27:29.731 --> 27:31.313
Approximately
2,000.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.182
And are you aware
that those 2,000 people

27:33.277 --> 27:34.767
work twice what
they're supposed to?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.352
That's a fabrication and
there's no record of it.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.436
You want a record?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.147
These people make less
than 20 cents an hour.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.107
You make $20 million a year.
How do you live with yourself?

27:41.201 --> 27:43.317
Every company makes
clothes the same way.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.777
Is it perfect? No,

27:45.038 --> 27:47.325
but we can't compete if
we don't do the same thing.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.991
And we're not violating the
terms of Jeremy's contract.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.497
No, you're just building an empire
on the backs of women and children.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.170
Are you kidding me?
Don't you say that.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.997
No children are involved.
So it's just women, then?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.547
You're twisting my words.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.671
We break no local laws,
no international laws...

27:59.761 --> 28:01.422
And yet, conditions
are so fucking bad

28:01.513 --> 28:04.175
that two people have killed
themselves in the last two years!

28:04.266 --> 28:07.054
God damn it, I don't care how
many people have killed themselves!

28:07.144 --> 28:09.135
This has nothing to do
with my company!

28:09.271 --> 28:10.682
We abide by the law.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.185
Are you done?

28:13.275 --> 28:16.188
Because you can get emotional
and he can get emotional

28:16.278 --> 28:19.737
and you still have no
evidence, no jury, and no case.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.939
And I don't have to remind you
that this testimony

28:22.034 --> 28:23.741
is not to be revealed
outside this room.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.784
SAMANTHA: And tomorrow
morning, we go to a judge,

28:25.871 --> 28:27.487
and then I send you back
to wherever you came from

28:27.581 --> 28:30.824
with nothing but your
crocodile tears and a big fat loss.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.709
LIPSCHITZ: Let me see if
I understand this correctly.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.678
Louis, you fabricated
a $50,000 donation to Columbia

28:44.765 --> 28:47.803
out of nothing
but love for your partner.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.175
Exactly.

28:49.311 --> 28:53.225
And Sheila, this same gesture
filled you with rage.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.396
As it would anyone.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.976
Then I believe I may have a
way to help you through this.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.522
Does it include me
screaming into a pillow?

28:59.613 --> 29:01.854
Because I'm out 50 grand.
Okay, you know what, Louis...

29:01.949 --> 29:03.280
If I may.

29:05.327 --> 29:08.365
I understand you two
have an interest in role-play.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.287
You told him about that?
Of course I did.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.331
It's therapy. It's a
passionate interest.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.827
Okay, well, I'm not playing Hansel
and Gretel with your Nazi therapist.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.459
Sheila, as I've told Louis
no fewer than 65 times,

29:20.259 --> 29:21.465
I am not a Nazi.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.427
Secondly, I am suggesting
nothing of the Hansel and Gretel sort.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.221
Wait a second, are you
suggesting that we do

29:27.349 --> 29:29.010
what you had me
and Harvey do? I am.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.724
Well, then, I'm out,
because I have no interest

29:30.811 --> 29:32.518
in me pretending to be Sheila
and her pretending to be me

29:32.604 --> 29:35.096
because it's stupid and it's
not gonna lead to anything.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.314
Are you finished?
Okay, let's try it.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.767
What gave rise
to the initial incident?

29:39.903 --> 29:41.814
Ironically, it happened
during role-play.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.066
Ah. Can you reenact it for me?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.988
No, I cannot, because
all I can remember

29:45.075 --> 29:47.942
is I was getting ready to play
Cinderella's Dirty Redemption

29:48.036 --> 29:50.778
and then the next thing I
know, she is yelling at me.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.159
Because you made it clear
I was unattractive to you.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.950
Sheila, that's just not true.
I don't care about your feet.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.876
You said they were fat.
You said they were fat.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.954
And instead of reassuring
me, all you focused on

30:00.048 --> 30:01.129
was the money
you were out.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.832
It was $9,000.
Don't you get it?

30:02.926 --> 30:04.963
What if I can't pay it back?
But you can pay it back.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.715
That's the whole reason
I spent the $50,000

30:07.806 --> 30:09.296
to convince you that
you're good at your job.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.596
No, you spent $50,000 to
make me feel trapped in my job.

30:12.686 --> 30:13.847
What the hell
are you talking about?

30:13.937 --> 30:16.053
I thought you loved
your job. So did I.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.772
Sheila, I don't understand.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.779
Louis, I never saw
myself having children.

30:28.702 --> 30:31.285
But the more I embrace
becoming a mother,

30:32.414 --> 30:36.078
the more I feel pulled
in two opposite directions.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.368
And maybe I just
want to pick one.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.496
Why didn't you
tell me this?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.458
Because being a warrior
is who I am.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.636
And I if I change who I am...

30:50.015 --> 30:52.552
What if Louis
won't want you anymore?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.304
Okay.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.720
Sheila, look at me.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.102
Being a warrior has
nothing to do with your job.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.772
It's who you are.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.813
And no matter what you choose
to do about your career,

31:08.241 --> 31:12.075
I support it 1,000%.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.363
I love you, Louis.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.291
(YAWNS)

31:27.386 --> 31:29.127
You look like you could
use this more than me.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.428
I came in early today
because I couldn't sleep

31:32.057 --> 31:33.388
and all of a sudden
it just hit me.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.715
What, are you stressed out
about a client?

31:35.102 --> 31:36.968
I was out late drinking
with Donna.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.394
(CHUCKLES) I feel that.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.269
Katrina, you know about this
Mike, Harvey, and Samantha thing?

31:43.360 --> 31:44.691
I do. Why?

31:44.778 --> 31:47.486
What if I told you Faye came
to me to keep an eye on them

31:47.572 --> 31:49.188
to make sure it doesn't
get out of control?

31:49.282 --> 31:51.899
I'd say it wouldn't
surprise me,

31:51.993 --> 31:53.449
but what you're
really asking is,

31:53.537 --> 31:55.278
do I think you
should warn them?

31:55.372 --> 31:58.160
Because I know
you didn't agree to spy.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.207
I guess that is
what I'm asking.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.411
Don't do it.
You mind if I ask why not?

32:03.505 --> 32:05.337
Have you ever seen
either one of them react well

32:05.424 --> 32:07.381
to an authority figure telling
them not to do something?

32:07.551 --> 32:09.963
Shit, it'll just make them
more likely to do it.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.043
Exactly.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.630
Besides, I already told Mike
not to push Samantha.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.381
With any luck,
we'll get out

32:15.475 --> 32:17.807
of this thing without it
blowing up in any of our faces.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.400
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

32:26.486 --> 32:27.772
I'm here to talk about today.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.147
Well, if you're looking for a
settlement, our original offer stands.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.737
"Original offer"? Were you in
there? You got your ass kicked.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.119
I'm just here to make
sure we're still good.

32:37.581 --> 32:38.696
You haven't seen it,
have you?

32:39.166 --> 32:41.203
Seen what?
Jeremy had an interview

32:41.293 --> 32:42.533
scheduled for today,

32:43.211 --> 32:44.576
but there was...

32:44.880 --> 32:47.247
Well, there was a
last-minute wardrobe change.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.509
Guess Russell Westbrook

32:53.597 --> 32:55.383
isn't the only one who
can make a fashion statement.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.385
Damn it, Mike, that
deposition was under seal.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.682
So sue me.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.310
But, if you do, it won't
be a countersuit anymore,

33:01.396 --> 33:02.636
which means
there will be a jury.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.472
And if you think I won't
have you sanctioned for this...

33:04.566 --> 33:06.728
Go ahead, 'cause this
is already going viral.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.775
The more Brick Street tries
to stop it from getting out,

33:08.862 --> 33:10.318
the more people
are gonna see it,

33:10.405 --> 33:12.646
so I suggest, Harvey,

33:13.116 --> 33:15.574
that you just tell them
to give us what we want.

33:16.745 --> 33:17.826
I don't get it.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.779
You went to all this trouble
just to get him out

33:19.873 --> 33:21.489
so he would sign
with a competitor?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.199
Well, I've got some news
for you, Harvey,

33:23.293 --> 33:26.081
he's actually not looking
to sign with a competitor.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.661
He's looking to be

33:28.590 --> 33:29.580
the competitor.

33:30.383 --> 33:33.717
He gets the money from his
contract to put into his company...

33:34.679 --> 33:36.590
Free advertising
from a public feud.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.423
And maybe he changes the way
things get done in the process.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.263
You helped him plan this thing
from the beginning, didn't you?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.344
Well...

33:43.438 --> 33:44.849
How the hell
did you pull that off?

33:44.981 --> 33:45.971
It was easy.

33:46.483 --> 33:47.848
You see, I knew
that you would play the man,

33:47.943 --> 33:49.525
but the thing is,
the version of me

33:49.611 --> 33:52.273
you thought you were playing,
he doesn't exist anymore.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.776
The new Mike cares
more about the results

33:54.866 --> 33:56.482
than he does about
playing the violin.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.576
Gotta give you credit, Mike,

34:00.747 --> 34:03.159
But you couldn't have
done any of this

34:03.291 --> 34:05.623
if you hadn't learned so much from
me all those years. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.168
Are you actually taking credit
for my win when you lost?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.376
Let's be very clear
about something here, Harvey.

34:12.634 --> 34:15.842
Right now, you are
the governor of Loserville,

34:15.929 --> 34:18.795
and I am the mayor
of Winnertown.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.472
You know mayor's
below governor, right?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.141
Not in Winnertown, he isn't.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.806
Mike, enjoy it
while it lasts.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.558
Next time, you won't have
the element of surprise.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.855
Who said there's gonna
be a next time?

34:29.275 --> 34:30.687
What do you say
we get a drink?

34:30.777 --> 34:32.233
You, me, and Donna?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.103
Yeah, that sounds
nice, Harvey.

34:35.489 --> 34:36.821
Donna, do you have a minute?

34:37.199 --> 34:38.190
Of course.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.150
Always.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.536
I just wanted to tell you that
I signed up for a dance class.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.289
Ooh, I like it.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.199
Tango? Salsa?
Ballet.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.376
I was into it
when I was younger.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.954
Of course you were.

34:52.966 --> 34:55.047
I'm so happy for you.
That's not all.

34:55.635 --> 34:56.966
Right after I signed up
for class,

34:57.053 --> 34:59.590
I noticed I had a voice mail
from Brian.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.339
He called me back.
What did he say?

35:02.434 --> 35:03.515
That's just it...

35:04.936 --> 35:06.518
I deleted it
without even listening.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.891
Katrina, that's amazing.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.847
Thank you, Donna.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.354
Hey, Harvey and I
are supposed to get together

35:13.445 --> 35:14.435
with Mike tonight.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.019
Do you want to join us?
I can't.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.525
Tonight's the first
night of class.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.690
Well, then, prance on
out of here.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.276
(GIGGLES)

35:25.206 --> 35:27.618
Did you see that video? I did.

35:27.709 --> 35:29.165
That asshole
set us up.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.164
And you know it.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.619
Well, I'm not letting
him get away with it.

35:32.714 --> 35:33.954
Samantha, he beat us
fair and square.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.297
Bullshit, he planned this
whole thing in advance.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.050
A clear violation
of Jeremy's contract.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.252
And knowing Mike,
we'll never prove it.

35:40.430 --> 35:41.420
Careful, Harvey.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.339
You're starting to sound
like you're proud of him.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.674
And what if I am?
Then get off the field,

35:45.769 --> 35:47.555
because one of us
isn't finished fighting.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.432
I told you, there's no way
we'll prove it.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.980
Then I'll make proof.
No, you won't.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.646
Are you paying attention to
what's going on around here?

35:54.736 --> 35:56.818
If you're talking about Faye,
Mike Ross isn't the only one

35:56.905 --> 35:58.612
that can do things
without leaving a trace.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.235
Samantha, I told him we
wouldn't do anything like this.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.112
And you told me
you wanted to win.

36:03.912 --> 36:05.869
Get out of my way.
No.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.743
You're letting this go,
and that's an order.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.207
You don't give me orders.
I do now.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.956
You do this, you'll wish your
problem was with Faye.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.134
Then you are taking
this loss, not me.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.642
What's that?
Your new business cards.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.892
This says my title is
"Vice President." It does.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.859
You're giving me a
promotion? And a 30% raise.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.772
Is this because I helped
you out with Sheila?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.232
It's because
you're a warrior.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.951
You always have been,
and it's long past time

36:46.037 --> 36:47.698
I let you know
how much I appreciate it.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.664
Thank you, Louis.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.288
No, Benjamin, thank you.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.252
I've gotta say,
you were right.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.803
This is much better
than going out.

37:05.890 --> 37:06.880
Thanks.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.886
Of course, when I
suggested it, I didn't mean

37:08.977 --> 37:10.934
that I would be the one
to go to the grocery store

37:11.020 --> 37:12.681
and the cheese shop
and the wine place.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.934
To be fair, I do buy
my own toilet paper.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.480
Which we would have
had to use as napkins

37:16.568 --> 37:18.650
if I hadn't also
picked up napkins.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.774
(DOOR OPENS)
Thank God he's here.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.354
Hey!

37:22.532 --> 37:24.569
You want some cheese?
What the hell did you do?

37:24.659 --> 37:26.115
What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.364
You bribed Charles Hu
to say I contacted him

37:28.455 --> 37:30.116
a year and a half ago
with a scheme

37:30.206 --> 37:32.493
to break up Jeremy's contract,
and I can't dispute it

37:32.584 --> 37:34.951
because we're on the record
saying the guy's a saint.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.703
Mike, listen to me, I had
nothing to do with this.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.333
Bullshit!
It's not bullshit, Mike.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.539
He's telling
the truth.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.424
Okay, well, if it wasn't you
then it was her.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.260
So my question is, what
are you gonna do about it?

37:45.346 --> 37:46.757
What the hell
can I do about it?

37:46.848 --> 37:48.964
You can say she fabricated
evidence, like she did.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.514
Are you out
of your mind?

37:50.602 --> 37:51.763
Do you know what
would happen to her?

37:51.853 --> 37:54.595
I don't care! She is cheating
my client out of a company

37:54.689 --> 37:56.179
that could change
people's lives!

37:56.274 --> 37:57.890
And I'm not gonna
sell her out!

37:58.151 --> 37:59.937
Just like I'd do for you
if you were still here.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.985
I don't believe this.
You're pissed that I left.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.527
No, Mike, I'm glad
that you left,

38:03.948 --> 38:06.736
and you could have come back
to visit any fucking time,

38:06.826 --> 38:10.035
but you came back to pick a fight
with me that you rigged six months ago.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.328
So it's not that I left,
it's just that I beat you.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.826
No, you almost did.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.332
I was gonna let you get away
with it, but she didn't.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.002
And I might want to kill her,
but I'm not gonna betray her.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.750
I don't care about her!
I care about you.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.633
You gave me your word,
and the Harvey I know

38:25.720 --> 38:29.554
wouldn't break his word and screw over
a bunch of innocent people in the process.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.389
Mike. No, you've
lost yourself, Harvey,

38:31.476 --> 38:32.682
and you know it.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.390
Harvey...

38:40.485 --> 38:41.691
No, you're gonna listen
to what I have to say,

38:41.778 --> 38:42.939
because you lied to me.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.103
I didn't lie,
I changed my mind.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.939
Bullshit.
You're right.

38:47.033 --> 38:50.071
It is bullshit, because I
don't take orders from you,

38:50.161 --> 38:52.402
and I tried to tell you that
and you wouldn't listen.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.329
So I did what
needed to be done.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.123
And you put us both at risk,
because if Faye finds out...

38:57.210 --> 38:58.951
She's not gonna find out.

38:59.045 --> 39:03.460
All I did was produce a piece of evidence
that proves exactly what we know he did.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.757
You didn't produce I,
you fabricated it

39:05.844 --> 39:08.006
because you can't stand
someone getting the better of you.

39:08.096 --> 39:11.009
I can't stand someone
ripping off my client.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.597
So what are you
really upset about?

39:12.684 --> 39:16.552
The fact that I crossed a line, or
that I beat your little adopted son?

39:16.729 --> 39:19.892
Samantha, Mike came at me
and I defended you,

39:19.983 --> 39:21.894
because that's what
partners do.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.892
Well, that's all over now,

39:24.737 --> 39:26.444
because I don't
trust you anymore.

39:38.668 --> 39:39.783
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

39:47.135 --> 39:48.125
Louis.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.418
What are you doing here?
Donna sent me.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.503
Can I
come in?

39:58.354 --> 39:59.719
Why didn't Donna
come herself?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.100
Well, she's with
Harvey now.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.680
She didn't want you
to hold it against her.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.561
I'm not gonna hold
anything against her, Louis.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.984
Well, I'm here to ask you not
to hold anything against Harvey.

40:07.614 --> 40:08.854
What do you
want me to say?

40:09.657 --> 40:11.739
She crossed the line,
he let her get away with it,

40:11.826 --> 40:13.567
and then he tried
to defend it to me.

40:13.661 --> 40:17.575
Mike, do you remember the time I told
you Harvey and I were like Ralph and Sam?

40:17.665 --> 40:19.702
The sheep dog
and the wolf, yeah.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.290
Of course I remember.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.994
Well, the point of that story
was, we were rivals at work.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.918
But no matter how much we
fought, at the end of the day,

40:27.467 --> 40:29.458
we didn't let it get in
the way of our friendship.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.424
Mike, I'm not saying
you can't be furious.

40:34.766 --> 40:38.304
I'm just saying, don't let this
be the end of you and Harvey.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.099
I got a plane to catch, Louis.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.221
Safe travels, Mike.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.277
Louis, wait.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.152
I never got a chance
to bring this by.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.985
I was gonna mail it
when I got back,

40:56.079 --> 40:58.411
but since you're here...

41:02.460 --> 41:05.327
Oh, my God. I gave
one just like this to Brian.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.329
I had a bunch of these
I gave away.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.207
I just couldn't find the
last one. Rachel took it.

41:11.427 --> 41:12.667
She was saving it for you.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.005
I wanted to get one that said,
"Future Harvard Grad."

41:16.808 --> 41:19.470
You know, 'cause I never
actually went to Harvard.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.143
This one's perfect.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.554
Tell Rachel I said
thank you, Mike. I will.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.859
Faye, if this could wait until
tomorrow, I've had a long day.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.786
I'm sure you did,
considering the impressive win

41:39.872 --> 41:41.988
you and Harvey got
on behalf of your client.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.915
Thank you, but like I said,
I've had a long day...

41:44.002 --> 41:47.996
Here's the thing, despite that win, I
was walking by earlier, and it appeared

41:48.089 --> 41:51.002
as if you and Harvey
were at each other's throats.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.585
Harvey and I fight about a lot
of things. So what?

41:54.762 --> 41:57.629
So I think Harvey wanted
to beat his former protégé

41:57.724 --> 42:00.136
so badly that he did something
he shouldn't have.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.054
You don't know what you're
talking about.

42:02.145 --> 42:04.512
We were about to lose,
and out of nowhere

42:04.605 --> 42:06.721
evidence shows up
that saves the day.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.894
I think he created
that evidence,

42:08.985 --> 42:12.569
you got upset about it, and if
you don't stop covering for him,

42:12.655 --> 42:14.817
instead of handling
it in-house,

42:15.033 --> 42:16.273
I'll hand him over to the Bar.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.412
Harvey didn't do anything,

42:22.790 --> 42:23.996
and that is all
I'm going to say.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.659
Then it was you.
I didn't say that.

42:26.753 --> 42:28.585
It doesn't matter.
I warned you,

42:28.671 --> 42:31.208
I will not tolerate
unethical behavior.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.085
You have no proof
I did anything.

42:33.176 --> 42:34.962
I don't care,
because I know you did it.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.465
Now, pack up your things.
I'm not packing anything.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.593
Then I'll have them packed for
you, because as of this second,

42:41.517 --> 42:42.507
you're fired.
