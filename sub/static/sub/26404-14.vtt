WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.919
Previously on "Station 19"...
I want you settled down.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.539
I may just have
to go on a few dates.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.669
I would love to get to
know... The check, right?

00:07.670 --> 00:10.209
Mom's never gonna be happy
if you're just phoning it in.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.329
Medic One... I'm considering
going for it.

00:12.330 --> 00:13.619
They asked if I could have

00:13.620 --> 00:16.248
my previous boss fill out
a recommendation.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.379
You know you're vastly
overqualified for this.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.539
That ruined my prospects
as captain of 19, but...

00:20.540 --> 00:21.999
It's also how you got me.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.459
Could that be
a bright spot, too?

00:23.460 --> 00:25.459
I don't do things
behind people's backs.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.619
I'm telling Andy about it. Cool.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.119
You're not worried about
how she's gonna react?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.579
Maybe I would be if I were you.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.499
I screwed up. It's Hughes.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.879
I am sick of the secrets,
and I'm tired of hiding,

00:33.880 --> 00:35.209
but we have to.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.790
Maybe we shouldn't be
a secret anymore.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.619
A flashover can happen
in a matter of seconds.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.579
All you need
is the perfect combination

00:44.580 --> 00:47.459
of air, heat,
and combustible material.

00:47.460 --> 00:50.289
The smoke around you
comes alive with fire,

00:50.290 --> 00:53.119
rushing toward you,
rushing over you.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.669
There's no time to outrun it.

00:55.670 --> 01:00.379
A blast so expansive, so big,

01:00.380 --> 01:03.040
it can rock your entire world.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.190
And you want to hear
the scariest part?

01:08.380 --> 01:10.830
Most of us
will never see it coming.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.879
You want to go again?

01:16.880 --> 01:17.919
No way. I can't.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.579
Come on, Herrera.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.420
10 more and you get
to pick what we do next.

01:23.670 --> 01:24.959
Why... One.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.379
Are you torturing me?

01:26.380 --> 01:28.209
Don't you have
other work-out buddies?

01:28.210 --> 01:29.789
Two. Well, I was
boxing with Warren...

01:29.790 --> 01:31.419
until I punched him.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.999
Well, you need more friends.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.539
I got you. You're my friend.

01:34.540 --> 01:35.749
That's big for me.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.749
Because you're not
a very friendly person?

01:37.750 --> 01:39.419
Yes, I am.

01:39.420 --> 01:40.670
When I want to be.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.169
Come on.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.329
Come on where?

01:44.330 --> 01:46.119
You said I get to pick
what we do next.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.999
I pick you coming with me,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.499
for hydrant inspections.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.419
You know, captains don't
do hydrant inspections.

01:52.420 --> 01:53.829
Not usually, that's true.

01:53.830 --> 01:56.329
But I want the company.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.119
You know, that's abuse.
Of our friendship.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.420
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:01.670 --> 02:03.079
We leave in 15.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.459
Wh...

02:05.460 --> 02:06.919
What if one of us transferred

02:06.920 --> 02:08.959
to a different department?

02:08.960 --> 02:10.619
You really want
to do long-distance?

02:10.620 --> 02:12.539
You're right. Never works.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.499
I could, -

02:14.500 --> 02:16.709
I could step down.

02:16.710 --> 02:19.169
I've had a long career.
Yours is just starting.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.379
Well, that's some
lame ass co-dependent

02:20.380 --> 02:21.619
self-sacrificial territory,

02:21.620 --> 02:23.210
and I won't live there, so...

02:24.960 --> 02:27.289
What are the rules here exactly?

02:27.290 --> 02:29.919
We're risking disciplinary
action, suspension.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.040
Possible termination.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.669
We aren't technically
allowed to date

02:33.670 --> 02:35.329
and work in the same department
when I outrank you...

02:35.330 --> 02:37.120
By about a thousand ranks..

02:39.080 --> 02:41.829
We don't have to go public.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.210
Risks are still the risks.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.919
There's, - There's really
only one other option

02:48.920 --> 02:50.080
I can think of and that's...

02:51.710 --> 02:54.119
You're probably right,

02:54.120 --> 02:56.169
maybe we should just keep things
under wraps. Don't hold out.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.709
What's the other option? It's nothing.
Forget it.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.169
No, you can't do that.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.419
You can't dangle
some secret silver bullet

03:00.420 --> 03:02.289
and not tell me what it is.
It's too crazy.

03:02.290 --> 03:03.749
Well, lay your crazy on me.
Lock and load, baby.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.329
You would never go for it.
Try me.

03:05.330 --> 03:06.829
- Marriage.
- What?

03:06.830 --> 03:09.000
It's a loophole. I'm sorry.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.619
Rank technically isn't
an issue amongst spouses.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.039
I told you, it's kind of crazy.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.959
Yeah, it's also
kind of a marriage.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.379
Which is why I'm gonna say "crazy"
yet again in this conversation.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.120
I shouldn't have brought it up.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.709
It is crazy.

03:24.710 --> 03:26.910
That a marriage license could
protect us from the rules.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.040
But...

03:30.330 --> 03:32.580
It's too crazy, right?

03:34.670 --> 03:36.920
We'll keep exploring
other options.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.749
We will find a solution, okay?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.170
Okay.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.500 --> 03:53.749
What are you doing?!
Caffeinating.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.209
No, no, no, no, no.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.539
This is Medic One coffee... Aah!

03:56.540 --> 03:59.079
I brewed specifically
for Warren, okay?

03:59.080 --> 04:01.959
It is highly concentrated.
For concentration.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.539
Can't you see
he's trying to study?

04:04.540 --> 04:05.999
Actually, I didn't see him

04:06.000 --> 04:07.919
or hear him
or even feel a presence.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.289
Why does he look
so creepy right now?

04:10.290 --> 04:11.499
He gets that way
when he's thinking.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.499
I asked him about
an in-field procedure

04:13.500 --> 04:15.289
literally five minutes ago.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.290
Been that way ever since.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.250
Did he just twitch?

04:21.290 --> 04:22.669
I got it!

04:22.670 --> 04:25.249
Congestive heart failure...
IV lasix and give nitro.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.499
No.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.119
What? No, no, no.
That would absolutely work.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.499
Giving Lasix and nitro

04:31.500 --> 04:33.169
is the right move
for someone with CHF...

04:33.170 --> 04:34.919
I did it a bunch of times
as a surgeon.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.959
Yeah, but without
a chest X-ray you can't be sure.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.039
And you can't chest x-ray
in the field.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.289
It says here, um,

04:40.290 --> 04:41.919
your patient
could have pneumonia

04:41.920 --> 04:43.040
or a pulmonary embolism.

04:45.830 --> 04:46.999
Yeah, I need Miller.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.959
Why? Would Miller
make you not wrong?

04:48.960 --> 04:50.619
Well, he's my actual
study buddy.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.919
No offense, man, but, you know,
he's... he's really helpful.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.879
Maybe it's his voice,

04:54.880 --> 04:56.329
that soothing baritone.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.000
I made you Medic One coffee.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.580
Where is Miller anyway?

05:12.500 --> 05:16.039
You have been here three times
this week already.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.959
- Another blind date?
- Afraid so.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.379
Although I think
it's safe to say

05:19.380 --> 05:20.579
that I've been stood up,

05:20.580 --> 05:21.829
so I'll... I'll just
take the check.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.079
Hey, sorry.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.169
I am so sorry
for being this late.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.039
Impossible client. You're Dean?

05:27.040 --> 05:29.249
Yeah. Nikki.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.459
No problem, but I-I do
need to get to work soon,

05:31.460 --> 05:32.789
so maybe we should just,
you know, call... Perfect.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.880
Let's make this quick.

05:38.460 --> 05:39.619
Listen.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.829
Can I be honest for a sec? Okay.

05:41.830 --> 05:42.959
I hate blind dates.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.209
Especially ones set up
by my father.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.119
I'm really just here
to make him happy,

05:46.120 --> 05:49.329
so can we maybe just chit chat,
go through the motions?

05:49.330 --> 05:51.039
Then we can both
tell our parents

05:51.040 --> 05:52.499
that it didn't work out
without being liars.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.289
Is that cool? Yes.
That is totally cool.

05:54.290 --> 05:55.920
Okay. Cool.

06:00.620 --> 06:01.789
Ooh. Ooh, sorry.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.289
Sorry.

06:03.290 --> 06:05.749
I know you saw
my dad this morning.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.329
Let me guess.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.999
He suckered you into helping him
move heavy boxes around.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.579
And now you're feeling the burn?

06:10.580 --> 06:11.620
No. No suckering.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.170
Maybe a little suckering, yeah.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.329
I'm glad. That I got suckered?

06:17.330 --> 06:19.079
No. No, just...

06:19.080 --> 06:21.249
There was a time
when I didn't think you and I

06:21.250 --> 06:24.039
would ever get here.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.459
Laughing, as friends
together like this.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.539
Especially here here,
given how we used to spend

06:28.540 --> 06:30.879
most of our time in this room.
Right.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.829
I'm glad we came out
the other end.

06:33.830 --> 06:34.919
It's like
I was telling Sullivan,

06:34.920 --> 06:36.540
I'm basically a friendship guru.

06:41.790 --> 06:43.999
There is my father,

06:44.000 --> 06:45.919
pounding on
the limo door yelling,

06:45.920 --> 06:47.329
"You better not be doing
what I think you're doing."

06:47.330 --> 06:49.249
And? We were literally
just comparing

06:49.250 --> 06:51.209
answers from our History final.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.789
Then he pulls out
a breathalyzer.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.289
Worst... prom... ever!

06:56.290 --> 06:58.039
He's got to be proud
of you now, though.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.290
You being a respectable
lawyer and everything.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.169
Is that what my dad
told your mom?

07:05.170 --> 07:07.329
Yes, I have a law degree.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.329
But I gave that all up
to be a graphic designer.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.789
Which my parents hate.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.999
My mom hates what I do, too.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.459
But you're a firefighter.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.499
I wanted to be a firefighter
when I was a kid.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.209
But then I figured out

07:20.210 --> 07:21.709
that you had to run into
burning buildings. Yeah.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.329
So I moved on to
my backup career...

07:24.330 --> 07:26.289
Space Ninja Princess.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.829
Sorry.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.209
Impossible client again.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.749
No, no, it's... it's no problem.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.999
Um, you know, actually,
maybe we should...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.169
Thanks for making this painless.

07:36.170 --> 07:37.540
Good luck on your other set-ups.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.539
Four hydrants cleared.

07:41.540 --> 07:42.919
39 to go.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.499
You know, most of my closest
friends are firefighters.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.959
And we're back to that.
But not all.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.879
I-I see the advantage to both,

07:49.880 --> 07:52.289
though it is helpful when there's a
shorthand, like with me and Maya.

07:52.290 --> 07:54.539
We can literally talk
to each other about anything.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.209
I had that with Ripley.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.789
A long time ago.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.330
We had a falling out.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.289
But we're rebuilding.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.770
You know, I was angry
for a long time.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.120
It's not easy
to let go out of that.

08:11.580 --> 08:12.959
But you're trying?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.459
Why are you so fixated
on that anyway?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.669
I just think it's not good
to always be alone.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.210
For anyone.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.249
Do you see that?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.579
Can't be more
than a few blocks away.

08:21.580 --> 08:24.039
19 to Dispatch,
we've spotted smoke.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.919
400 block of Nelson.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.829
Do you have any reports
of fire in that area?

08:27.830 --> 08:29.289
Dark smoke, rapid rising.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.669
Whatever it is,
it's not being contained.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.499
Negative 19.
No report in the area.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.419
All right, here, let's see
if we can get to it...

08:34.419 --> 08:36.499
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Herrera, that's a sidewalk!

08:36.500 --> 08:37.960
I know. Hang on!

08:45.120 --> 08:47.329
Looks like the fire is seated
at the rear of the building,

08:47.330 --> 08:48.829
bravo side.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.999
First thing... we'll do
a 360 around the perimeter.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.380
I'll call it in.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.749
We need assistance
at 436 Nelson Street.

08:56.750 --> 08:58.289
We got a structure fire
in progress.

08:58.290 --> 09:01.289
Copy. Dispatching 42
to your location.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.249
Think we ought to wait
for back-up?

09:03.250 --> 09:04.579
We don't have a hose line
or any standard gear

09:04.580 --> 09:05.999
beyond turnouts and bottles.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.289
He-Help!

09:07.290 --> 09:08.789
Please! Help.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.249
Sir, are there
any more people inside?

09:10.250 --> 09:11.669
Yeah, a few.
I'm not sure how many.

09:11.670 --> 09:12.789
You have to get them out,
please.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.709
No waiting now.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.580
No, there isn't.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.329
You smell that?

09:30.330 --> 09:32.169
Smells like dark roast.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.379
Bags of coffee everywhere.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.709
Be careful.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.880
Dry grounds are highly flammable
at peak temperatures.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.210
Help!

09:44.540 --> 09:45.580
Help!

09:48.290 --> 09:50.619
Help! Help! Anybody!

09:50.620 --> 09:53.209
You okay? Where are the others?

09:53.210 --> 09:54.619
A bunch ran out the back.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.919
She just dropped.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.209
Let's get you two outside.

09:57.210 --> 09:59.329
Can you walk? Are you dizzy?

09:59.330 --> 10:00.419
Are you having
any shortness of breath?

10:00.420 --> 10:02.709
Station 19, we got it from here.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.829
We're tagging you guys out.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.330
Captain's orders.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.499
Knew about 19's response time,

10:18.500 --> 10:20.379
but this far out of district?

10:20.380 --> 10:22.209
Gonna have to get
a faster truck.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.249
Good to see you there,
short stop.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.749
Short stop?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.579
You still mad about
my double play from last week?

10:27.580 --> 10:29.619
Is that why you had Cook
"tag us out" inside?

10:29.620 --> 10:31.289
I won't say I'm not mad,

10:31.290 --> 10:33.419
but just because you won
a Medal of Valor

10:33.420 --> 10:34.579
doesn't mean that
all your throws count.

10:34.580 --> 10:37.329
I had Galarza out at third
by a mile, and you know it.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.669
You guys need
to be careful in there.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.630
Those bags inside will combust
if it gets too hot.

10:42.460 --> 10:45.119
Well, dried grounds
make for bad kindling.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.829
My people know
what they're doing.

10:46.830 --> 10:49.999
Always did hear you brought
your A-game there, Sullivan.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.169
Never saw you
on the diamond, though.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.169
He's not
the group activity type.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.709
Maybe that's a good thing.

10:54.710 --> 10:55.959
'Cause Montana here looks like

10:55.960 --> 10:57.160
he can play some serious ball.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.919
Henderson, make sure
I got enough water

11:00.920 --> 11:02.669
pumping through that hydrant.
Copy that.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.499
Sorry. Do you know me?

11:04.500 --> 11:05.879
Yeah, I had a cousin
work under you for a beat

11:05.880 --> 11:07.079
out there in the Midwest.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.329
Had some stories...
All good ones, though.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.169
Said you were a true cowboy.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.119
Ted Conlin.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.579
Love to see you
out on the field sometime.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.749
Look, this thing looks like

11:15.750 --> 11:17.459
it'll get bigger
before it calms down.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.749
You want us to stick around
and assist?

11:18.750 --> 11:19.919
I appreciate your support,

11:19.920 --> 11:21.789
but, Dispatch gave us the call.

11:21.790 --> 11:24.249
Not to be territorial,
but, you know, rules are rules.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.579
You're the home team. Got it.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.379
We'll get out of your hair.
All right.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.999
Looking forward to the rematch.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.209
See ya at the next game,
Montana!

11:31.210 --> 11:32.999
I didn't know
we had a softball team.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.169
I think he likes you.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.579
Maybe you should
go get his number.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.789
Herrera. Add him to
your "friends" list.

11:37.790 --> 11:39.579
Herrera. He gave you a nickname.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.619
Exactly. He gave me a nickname.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.669
He likes rules. You love rules.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.250
You think
he likes smoothies too?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.209
My hobby proposed
to me this morning.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.669
What?!!

11:54.670 --> 11:56.329
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

11:56.330 --> 11:57.709
Not the burn-yourself-with-
scalding-hot-coffee

11:57.710 --> 11:59.619
kind of proposal.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.079
You've only been playing with
your new hobby for a few months.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.080
No, I know. We're not...

12:03.081 --> 12:04.669
We're not there yet,
but things are good.

12:04.670 --> 12:06.999
They're... really good,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.959
and we would really love
to stop being a secret hobby.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.459
And more of a "live out loud",

12:11.460 --> 12:13.749
"show your hobby
off in public" kind of...

12:13.750 --> 12:16.959
Anyway, it turns out one way to
circumvent disciplinary action

12:16.960 --> 12:18.789
is to sign a piece of paper.

12:18.790 --> 12:20.169
A marriage license?

12:20.170 --> 12:21.669
Meaning you'd be married?

12:21.670 --> 12:22.999
Well, yeah, not... I mean
not married married,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.119
but piece-of-paper married.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.419
Both of those things
last forever.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.169
Untrue. We could
piece-of-paper break up.

12:28.170 --> 12:29.619
That's called divorce.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.079
Okay, look.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.249
I agree.
I know it's not perfect,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.329
but there is
no perfect solution here.

12:36.330 --> 12:38.539
And, this one is very practical.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.379
So is toilet paper.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.789
Is that what you want?

12:41.790 --> 12:43.459
Toilet paper proposal?
Don't call it that.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.789
Are you really considering this?

12:44.790 --> 12:47.709
Well, I want... I want Ripley.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.999
And I want my job.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.170
And this gets me both.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.459
I'm sorry. Do you have
a better suggestion?

12:54.460 --> 12:55.540
Yes!

12:56.960 --> 12:58.619
Okay, no. Exact... See?

12:58.620 --> 13:01.039
But marriage is
not a transaction.-

13:01.040 --> 13:03.079
Or practical. It's... It's...

13:03.080 --> 13:05.119
Look, I am not a heart and rainbows
kind of girl, and you know that.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.459
I don't want
all that fluffy stuff.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.289
I'm not suggesting
all that "fluffy stuff."

13:08.290 --> 13:10.829
I'm just asking
if something "practical"

13:10.830 --> 13:13.959
is more important to you than...

13:13.960 --> 13:14.960
something real.

13:18.210 --> 13:19.539
You know what?
You don't know what's going on

13:19.540 --> 13:22.000
in my head, Montgomery,
so stay... out of there.

13:23.580 --> 13:24.580
Stay out.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.490
That needs to go in the hamper!

13:31.290 --> 13:33.249
All right. Ask me another one.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.079
Victim presents with
altered mental status,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.879
seizures, and
evidence of vomiting

13:37.880 --> 13:39.580
before loss of consciousness.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.210
Head trauma could explain it.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.329
Hey, what happens
if you're ghosted?

13:45.330 --> 13:46.749
Is the patient mobile?

13:46.750 --> 13:49.289
No. No, no, no. Not the patient.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.079
I'm just asking what happens
if you meet someone,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.669
and they're smart,
and they're gorgeous,

13:52.670 --> 13:54.789
and you bond over adolescent
school dance traumas,

13:54.790 --> 13:56.999
and... and then she leaves,

13:57.000 --> 13:58.579
acting like she's never
gonna speak to you again.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.289
Who are we talking about?

14:00.290 --> 14:03.379
Nikki.
My hit-and-run coffee date.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.999
Like may... maybe
it's okay, you know?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.249
We clearly met under
the wrong circumstances,

14:08.250 --> 14:10.379
and I'm... I'm not gonna
give my mother

14:10.380 --> 14:13.079
the satisfaction of being right
about this whole dating thing.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.669
Maybe I can call
without calling?

14:15.670 --> 14:17.039
What if Nikki has...

14:17.040 --> 14:18.879
Epilepsy! What? No. What?

14:18.880 --> 14:20.249
My patient has epilepsy.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.169
Mild head trauma from a seizure.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.289
Yeah. According to this,

14:24.290 --> 14:26.749
you're supposed to diagnose
ethylene glycol poisoning

14:26.750 --> 14:28.419
with a handheld i-STAT machine.

14:28.420 --> 14:30.879
What? We... We don't have
a handheld i-STAT.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.169
Medic One does. Damn it!

14:33.170 --> 14:35.919
I keep getting
these answers wrong.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.619
Either I'm thinking
like a surgeon

14:37.620 --> 14:38.789
or I'm thinking like an EMT.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.289
If I'm gonna pass
this evaluation,

14:40.290 --> 14:41.829
I got to figure out
how to think like Medic One.

14:41.830 --> 14:43.789
Give me another one.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.669
Okay.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.749
What if I pretend
to text her by accident?

14:47.750 --> 14:49.000
A medical question.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.419
- Chief?
- Sullivan.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.249
Chief, it is so weird
that you're here.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.999
We were just talking about you.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.829
Captain Sullivan was just about
to give you a call, right?

15:01.830 --> 15:03.329
He was?

15:03.330 --> 15:05.120
I'm gonna go...
restock the rig now.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.919
- I don't know.
- Hey.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.620
Let me help you with those.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.540
You're in a good mood. I am.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.579
Today's been a pretty
great day so far.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.289
Called in a structure fire,

15:19.290 --> 15:21.249
helped Sullivan
with a good friend,

15:21.250 --> 15:22.829
helping you as your good friend.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.290
I'm kind of on a roll.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.999
So I heard you beat 42
to the punch earlier today.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.329
Hey.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.459
Conlin said you rescued
three civilians

15:36.460 --> 15:37.460
before they arrived.

15:37.461 --> 15:39.249
He seems like
a decent guy, Conlin.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.039
Yeah, he's great.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.499
You two ever hang out?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.289
What?

15:44.290 --> 15:45.790
Nothing. Just, - Never mind.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.380
Hey, can I run
a hypothetical by you?

15:51.420 --> 15:53.709
Say two firefighters
are married.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.289
It doesn't really matter
who holds rank

15:55.290 --> 15:56.829
in that scenario, correct?

15:56.830 --> 15:59.079
No, it doesn't.
And you already knew that.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.709
Why are you asking me?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.829
This about Hughes?
Are you two trying...

16:02.830 --> 16:05.420
No, no, that's...
Definitely not.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.829
I mean, it's a possible
option I presented,

16:09.830 --> 16:11.419
but I just needed to bend
a friend's ear on it.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.579
That is all. Thank you.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.709
This isn't the best place
to discuss this sort of thing.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.999
Sure. Understood.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.209
But maybe,

16:20.210 --> 16:22.169
over beers instead?

16:22.170 --> 16:24.000
After, shift?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.249
Yeah, sounds great. I like beer.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.040
I remember.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.820
You, - have you
talked to Andy today?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.419
She's on some kick about us

16:44.420 --> 16:46.669
as... as her friends, and...

16:46.670 --> 16:48.079
We got to tell her.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.709
This thing
with you and me, it's...

16:49.710 --> 16:51.119
I know, you're right.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.079
Andy deserves the truth.
I agree.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.709
So we'll tell her about us?

16:54.710 --> 16:56.120
Today. Today it is.

16:57.170 --> 16:58.919
Okay.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.080
Wait.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.999
You know, if...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.419
we are coming clean today...

17:09.420 --> 17:10.878
this might be our last chance

17:10.880 --> 17:12.960
to secretly steal away.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.829
It'd be a shame to let
a last chance just pass us by.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.460
A really big shame.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.289
Okay, we can explain. It's
not what it looked like.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.709
I was just...
It kind of just happened.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.249
It's... Well, it...
Not just happened.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.290
What am I looking at?

17:43.750 --> 17:46.169
Has this...

17:46.170 --> 17:48.040
Has this happened before?

17:50.830 --> 17:52.419
Yeah. Yes.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.789
So it's... this has been
happening?

17:55.790 --> 17:57.039
A lot?

17:57.040 --> 17:58.120
For how long?

17:59.380 --> 18:00.619
For how long?

18:00.620 --> 18:02.499
Since, -

18:02.500 --> 18:04.209
Since the outbreak on the train.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.880
So it's been weeks?

18:07.790 --> 18:10.079
My God.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.669
Andy, but we were gonna
explain it to you... My God.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.290
We were...

18:21.500 --> 18:23.329
Something wrong? Forget
everything I said.

18:23.330 --> 18:25.379
I know nothing about my friends.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.419
Ignore my wisdom. It wasn't wise.
What happened?

18:27.420 --> 18:29.119
I'm just trying to process
a few things

18:29.120 --> 18:30.619
like the fact that

18:30.620 --> 18:32.669
my best friend's apparently
been jumping my ex

18:32.670 --> 18:33.959
since they were
quarantined on a train.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.419
Ha! Weird, right?

18:35.420 --> 18:36.919
Anyway, like I said, I'm fine.
I'm just...

18:36.920 --> 18:39.169
I just needed
to vent for a second.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.539
Thank you.
I feel a lot better now.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.829
Wait. Gibson's your... ex?

18:43.830 --> 18:45.379
Structure fire
at 436 Nelson Street.

18:45.380 --> 18:47.459
RIT assist needed from 19.
Respond.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.379
Nelson Street?
Weren't we just there?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.919
We got a fire at
a coffee processing plant!

18:52.920 --> 18:54.379
Could have been out an hour ago,

18:54.380 --> 18:55.959
which means conditions
have escalated!

18:55.960 --> 18:58.289
Alert level's high!
The incident commander needs us

18:58.290 --> 19:00.379
on stand-by
for Rapid Intervention.

19:00.380 --> 19:03.289
Chief's already
on-site to coordinate.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.960
Move!

19:10.330 --> 19:12.499
Well, you ruined my solution.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.079
You mean I made you stop and
think through a decision

19:15.080 --> 19:16.329
that affects
the rest of your life?

19:16.330 --> 19:18.329
I was thinking
things through, okay?

19:18.330 --> 19:19.709
I hadn't made any decisions yet,

19:19.710 --> 19:21.329
and I was just getting right
with this practical solution,

19:21.330 --> 19:23.419
and you got all... in my head.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.079
So now what?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.959
So... I don't know.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.379
Now it has to be no.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.079
No to marriage. No to practical.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.789
No to toilet paper. Good!

19:32.790 --> 19:33.790
Thank you for that.

19:33.791 --> 19:35.879
Because marriage
isn't practical.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.329
It's an endless,
illogical compromise

19:39.330 --> 19:42.329
between people
who are drunk on love.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.959
It's amazing, but... Can
we just stick to work talk

19:43.960 --> 19:45.290
for the rest of the shift?

20:05.330 --> 20:07.879
19. Glad to have you back.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.999
But don't consider this
a rematch, by any means.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.459
Things got more complicated
after you left.

20:12.460 --> 20:14.289
Got to give my people
some more bottles.

20:14.290 --> 20:15.829
And watch your team
on this one, Montana.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.329
We've already had
a few close calls.

20:17.330 --> 20:19.459
Will do. Montana?

20:19.460 --> 20:20.749
Don't. Civilians cleared
of the building?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.039
Primary search is over.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.749
42's on the fire attack
at the main entrance.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.879
Grab Bishop.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.249
Hook our engine up
to that hydrant.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.460
You got it.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.579
Hi. We're working together?

20:32.580 --> 20:33.959
Sullivan's orders. I see.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.459
I need sterile water.
And gimme some 4x4s.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.249
Dad? Dad, what are you doing?

20:38.250 --> 20:39.999
Hey, I took on a new job.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.749
Private EMT. Great?

20:41.750 --> 20:43.459
First day,
we get called to assist.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.919
We've already treated
two second-degree burns!

20:45.920 --> 20:48.749
That's... great? I know!

20:48.750 --> 20:51.539
I didn't know your dad was
private-EMT-ing. Me neither.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.260
Apparently nobody tells me
anything anymore.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.749
About that,
and not telling you...

20:57.750 --> 20:59.459
No talking, please.
But I just...

20:59.460 --> 21:01.920
No, I crack it,
you rig it, okay?

21:03.210 --> 21:07.459
You know, I spent all morning...

21:07.460 --> 21:10.209
talking about how unbreakable
our friendship is.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.170
I thought we weren't talking.

21:11.171 --> 21:13.709
We're not. We're working.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.789
Worst part is,

21:15.790 --> 21:17.910
you're normally the person
I would talk to about this.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.919
Hammer set.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.499
Water on the way!

21:25.500 --> 21:27.539
What it is, is...
So we are talking.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.249
We need more hoses in here ASAP!

21:29.250 --> 21:31.619
Possible flashover.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.879
Did he just say flashover?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.419
All those bags
of combustible grounds,

21:34.420 --> 21:35.709
stacked a mile high.

21:35.710 --> 21:37.790
If a flashover hits,
this whole place is going up.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.079
- Everybody back up!
- Move! Move!

21:41.080 --> 21:43.169
- Everybody get back!
- Get back!

21:43.170 --> 21:45.789
- Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

21:45.790 --> 21:49.209
Get back! Get back now!

21:49.210 --> 21:50.499
Get back! Pull out!

21:50.500 --> 21:51.790
42, pull out of the building!

22:09.790 --> 22:12.119
We've got multiple
downed firefighters.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.289
Initiating Mayday protocol.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.119
Ladder Companies, engines...

22:16.120 --> 22:17.919
I repeat...

22:17.920 --> 22:20.039
We've got multiple downed
firefighters from an explosion.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.709
Initiating Mayday protocol.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.079
I need the next
due Ladder Companies,

22:23.080 --> 22:24.919
engines, and Aid Cars ASAP!

22:24.920 --> 22:28.169
19, you're
my Rapid Intervention Team.

22:28.170 --> 22:29.459
Sullivan, I'm gonna need

22:29.460 --> 22:31.079
a personnel
accountability report

22:31.080 --> 22:32.539
for everyone on scene. Right.

22:32.540 --> 22:34.169
As soon as we have
all of our people out,

22:34.170 --> 22:35.920
we begin a defensive attack. Go.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.419
We're being deployed.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.459
We have a report
of 10 members of 42

22:40.460 --> 22:42.209
being inside the building
when it blew,

22:42.210 --> 22:43.959
we don't know many
were impacted by the blast.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.789
There are no real points of
reference once you're in there,

22:45.790 --> 22:47.079
so it will be easy
to get turned around.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.619
We move in two teams,
two pairs each.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.209
When we find someone,
two of us take them to safety.

22:52.210 --> 22:53.579
The other two
continue to search.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.209
We use 42's hose lines as
a guide to find our people.

22:56.210 --> 22:58.249
Some of them may be trying
to follow those lines out.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.170
And listen for PASS devices.
Go, go!

23:07.620 --> 23:09.880
Over here. Come here.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.709
Cook!

23:23.710 --> 23:25.170
I got him.

23:28.330 --> 23:30.329
Hey. Cook, right?

23:30.330 --> 23:31.829
Yeah. Come on.

23:31.830 --> 23:34.250
First base?
Don't worry. We got you.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.169
Ready?

23:37.170 --> 23:38.880
Go. Go.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.119
We got it from here.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.539
Got it. Got it.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.330
Go.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.789
What the hell was that?!

23:54.790 --> 23:56.289
Heads-up!

23:56.290 --> 23:57.459
Some of these bags are reaching

23:57.460 --> 23:59.039
their auto-ignition temperature.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.579
They can burst at any moment.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.329
These things are
like ticking time-bombs.

24:02.330 --> 24:03.460
Everybody, be careful!

24:04.960 --> 24:06.379
Need a break, pops?

24:06.380 --> 24:08.419
Let me know.
I can handle this solo.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.379
What I need is to listen
to FD updates

24:10.380 --> 24:11.709
so we know what
we're dealing with.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.169
Look, my old man
has bad knees, too.

24:14.170 --> 24:16.669
Why don't you sit this one out?

24:16.670 --> 24:18.079
Try again.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.419
What?

24:19.420 --> 24:21.249
I said try again.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.789
Do you know
who you're talking to?

24:22.790 --> 24:24.579
This is Captain Pruitt Herrera.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.329
He is better, smarter, and
definitely a faster driver

24:26.330 --> 24:27.709
than you could ever hope to be.

24:27.710 --> 24:29.249
He was handling calls
bigger than this

24:29.250 --> 24:30.669
while you were in diapers.
Show some respect.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.170
I've got it covered, Tanner.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.419
This one looked bad,
came to help.

24:40.420 --> 24:41.999
How is he?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.080
Cook's airway is clear,
but he's still not breathing.

24:47.210 --> 24:48.789
Wow.

24:48.790 --> 24:50.579
It got so hot, it burned
under his turnouts.

24:50.580 --> 24:52.709
His skin's already getting hard.

24:52.710 --> 24:54.289
His lungs can't expand
to draw in air.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.499
Got to get him air.
And fluids...

24:55.500 --> 24:57.459
He needs a central line
and a... and an escharotomy.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.919
Medic One,
arriving on the scene.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.289
It's... It's a vertical slit
cut down the chest

25:01.290 --> 25:02.250
and through the burnt flesh.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.749
That'll allow his chest
to expand again.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.209
Can you do that? No, not here.

25:05.210 --> 25:06.959
We need to get him
to an E.R., but...

25:06.960 --> 25:08.289
he won't make it in time
if he can't breathe.

25:08.290 --> 25:09.710
Hey, hey. Over here.

25:14.620 --> 25:15.959
Mid-30s, male.

25:15.960 --> 25:17.379
Third-degree burns across
his upper torso area.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.079
Shireen Varma. Medic One.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.329
This one's charred to hell.

25:20.330 --> 25:22.209
No IV access.
Let's prep for an escharotomy.

25:22.210 --> 25:23.459
Antibiotics on standby.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.749
You're gonna do
the escharotomy here?

25:24.750 --> 25:25.829
You bet your ass we are.

25:25.830 --> 25:27.150
Isn't that what you said
you'd do?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.499
You're not gonna sedate him?

25:30.500 --> 25:32.079
You could drop this guy off
in the middle of a NASCAR race,

25:32.080 --> 25:33.999
he wouldn't wake up right now.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.040
Push lidocaine,
then hand me a scalpel.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.040
I got Lee.

25:50.170 --> 25:51.709
Homerun hitter's coming next.

25:51.710 --> 25:54.789
How many more?!

25:54.790 --> 25:56.120
Here comes Galarza.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.709
Best second baseman
in the department.

25:59.710 --> 26:00.960
I got you, bud.

26:03.710 --> 26:05.209
We got everyone?

26:05.210 --> 26:06.619
Still can't find Henderson.

26:06.620 --> 26:08.670
Henderson, come in.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.830
I can do the final sweep.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.379
No, wait.

26:15.380 --> 26:18.170
Sir, we already cleared
that area out.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.669
There are bags
exploding everywhere.

26:21.670 --> 26:23.830
You should not go back there.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.289
Sir, this structure
is not sound!

26:27.290 --> 26:28.880
I guess you better
get moving then.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.249
Ripley here.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.959
Is all of 42 accounted for?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.999
No, no. Conlin's still inside.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.039
He went rogue and stayed behind
to look for Henderson.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.749
I see Henderson was shipped
to Rainer First

26:43.750 --> 26:45.919
10 minutes ago.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.670
Conlin, what's your location?

26:49.710 --> 26:51.209
My company's not clear yet.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.249
Henderson's clear.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.749
Now it's your turn
to get out of there.

26:53.750 --> 26:57.249
Not sure if I can
do that right now.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.460
The beam fell.
I think my leg is broken.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.169
Put the structure on lockdown!

27:03.170 --> 27:04.999
The building's losing
all structural integrity.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.209
No one comes back in.

27:06.210 --> 27:07.879
Captain, what is your location?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.249
We're coming in for you.

27:09.250 --> 27:10.619
Montana, your team's
done enough!

27:10.620 --> 27:11.669
Tell us where you are.

27:11.670 --> 27:14.209
No one comes back in.

27:14.210 --> 27:16.879
Captain's orders.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.499
I mean, screw that, right?
There's an officer down.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.379
42 has to follow his command,
but not us.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.959
He says the structure
isn't sound.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.709
We can't just leave him in there.
He made his decision.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.230
He's the ranking Captain
of this scene.

27:26.210 --> 27:27.459
He doesn't want
to risk more lives

27:27.460 --> 27:28.669
because he knows better
than to waste them.

27:28.670 --> 27:29.749
What are you doing?

27:29.750 --> 27:30.919
I outrank Conlin.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.169
I'm superseding his command.

27:32.170 --> 27:33.379
I'm coming with you.

27:33.380 --> 27:34.579
No. I need you
on the building blueprints.

27:34.580 --> 27:35.879
You're gonna be my eyes
over the radio.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.249
Luke... I trust you.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.670
Hughes.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.499
You were the last one
to see Conlin, right?

27:46.500 --> 27:47.789
Where was he? Why
are you doing this?

27:47.790 --> 27:49.459
I'm not risking
anyone else's life.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.249
Especially yours.
That is not fair.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.459
Hey. Don't mistake this
for preferential treatment.

27:53.460 --> 27:54.709
There has to be another option.

27:54.710 --> 27:56.250
Not anymore. Now where was he?

28:00.290 --> 28:01.749
Southern corridor.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.619
Please don't... It's okay.
I'm coming back.

28:03.620 --> 28:05.290
I promise.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.079
Found Conlin's drop-line.
Sullivan, talk to me.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.119
About 30 feet ahead,
you're gonna turn left.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.959
That will put you in
the building's south wing.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.080
Copy that. On the move.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.040
He'll make it out.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.379
You still with me, Chief?

28:34.380 --> 28:36.420
Entering the south wing now.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.329
If he's in the west wing,

28:39.330 --> 28:40.879
then he could be
by the generator.

28:40.880 --> 28:42.879
Or was that the east wing?
Help me remember.

28:42.880 --> 28:43.620
Sullivan? Captain?

28:43.621 --> 28:44.999
Talk to me.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.709
Herrera?
I'm not sure where I am.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.829
Chief's inside.
I-I-I'm stuck here.

28:48.830 --> 28:51.749
I need an Incident Commander
who knows the ropes right now.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.499
I got you. All right, everyone.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.379
Let's get ready for
when the Chief comes out.

28:55.380 --> 28:57.169
Grab your rotary saws.
If that fire goes out,

28:57.170 --> 28:59.039
you cut the bars
off those windows.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.579
You four! Get to the entrance,

29:00.580 --> 29:03.039
keep it clear of fires
so there's another way out.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.619
Hey, kid, quit standing there!

29:04.620 --> 29:05.920
Move!

29:16.290 --> 29:17.460
Conlin!

29:31.080 --> 29:32.580
Luke, talk to me.

29:34.330 --> 29:36.079
Where is he?
Why isn't he out yet?

29:36.080 --> 29:37.709
You still with me, Chief?

29:37.710 --> 29:39.249
Come on, come on, come on.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.829
Come on.

29:41.830 --> 29:44.249
Why is he still in? Come on, come
on, come on. Luke, answer me.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.040
Come on. Come on.

29:48.330 --> 29:49.330
Chief?

29:54.460 --> 29:55.879
- Luke?
- I got him!

29:55.880 --> 29:57.330
We're coming out!

30:17.380 --> 30:20.790
Gurneys! We need O2 and IVs now!

30:49.500 --> 30:51.329
How's G-Galarza and Cook?

30:51.330 --> 30:52.669
They're being taken care of.

30:52.670 --> 30:55.249
Good. Don't want to lose
my two best players.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.540
I got to figure out a way
to make it up to you guys.

30:59.460 --> 31:00.789
Well, the Chief and I...
We've been thinking about

31:00.790 --> 31:02.169
grabbing a beer or two later.

31:02.170 --> 31:04.249
You should join.
When you're cleared.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.169
First round's on me. All right.

31:06.170 --> 31:09.080
Looks like you made a friend.

31:10.830 --> 31:12.000
Suppose I did.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.119
I was talking it over

31:15.120 --> 31:16.749
with the rest
of the team, and...

31:16.750 --> 31:19.619
we'd like permission to stay,
work a double shift.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.329
A double? There's
a need right now.

31:21.330 --> 31:23.329
A lot of responders
are down after this call,

31:23.330 --> 31:24.669
and we wanna help them
any way we can,

31:24.670 --> 31:26.749
even if they sometimes

31:26.750 --> 31:29.289
kick our ass
on the softball field.

31:29.290 --> 31:30.959
Granted.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.289
Let's get the rigs back to 19

31:32.290 --> 31:33.450
and prepare for an overnight.

31:37.210 --> 31:38.539
You sure that's a good idea?

31:38.540 --> 31:40.210
Yeah, they can handle it.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.959
You, on the other hand...

31:43.960 --> 31:45.499
You should take a rest.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.749
You're giving me orders now?

31:46.750 --> 31:48.169
It's been a while

31:48.170 --> 31:49.890
since you've seen
the inside of a firefight.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.709
I might tell Hughes to also
spend some time off the clock.

31:53.710 --> 31:56.960
She looks like she could,
use the break, too.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.289
You still on shift
after all this?

32:05.290 --> 32:07.169
That little fire?

32:07.170 --> 32:09.119
It was nothing.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.169
I saw what you did for my dad,

32:11.170 --> 32:13.579
putting that kid in his place.

32:13.580 --> 32:16.539
Thank you.
For looking out for him.

32:16.540 --> 32:17.830
As if I needed it.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.619
Personally, I think the new job's great,
Mr. Herrera. Don't encourage him.

32:23.620 --> 32:24.879
I never wanted
to stop being useful.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.329
I'm not gonna start now.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.579
I'll see you next shift.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.120
Youngblood! Let's go!

32:38.290 --> 32:40.540
I'm good. Thanks.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.669
You could have died in there.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.919
But I didn't.
But you could have.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.669
I had other plans. Okay.

32:46.670 --> 32:48.329
Okay, you and I...
We are risk-taking,

32:48.330 --> 32:51.209
fire-chasing,
out-of-our-mind weirdos.

32:51.210 --> 32:53.419
You know that, right?
That's... That's us.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.419
Yeah, so getting married
for "practical" reasons,

32:55.420 --> 32:57.709
to circumvent the rules,
to cheat the system...

32:57.710 --> 32:59.499
That is not... that's not us.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.459
I don't... That's not me, anyway.
Okay.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.039
So, no. The answer is no,

33:04.040 --> 33:05.789
I don't want...
I don't want toilet paper.

33:05.790 --> 33:07.999
I don't... either?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.459
But, no, I don't want
hearts or rainbows either.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.459
That's not
what this is about for me.

33:13.460 --> 33:16.329
I don't think I-I don't think
I realized quite how much

33:16.330 --> 33:17.459
'til I was standing out here
waiting for you

33:17.460 --> 33:19.790
to come running out of
those doors, but I...

33:22.170 --> 33:23.420
I want all of it.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.829
I'm all in.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.539
I want something...

33:30.540 --> 33:32.709
I want something real.
I want that.

33:32.710 --> 33:33.950
When I get married, if I get...

33:35.580 --> 33:37.959
If I get married,
I want love and inspiration

33:37.960 --> 33:40.419
and respect, and I want real.

33:40.420 --> 33:41.999
And I think you want that, too,
and I want it...

33:42.000 --> 33:45.039
I want it with you.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.669
And I think this must be
the adrenaline talking

33:46.670 --> 33:48.619
'cause I don't know
what I'm saying, but, um...

33:48.620 --> 33:49.789
Damn it. Fine. Okay.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.710
Lucas Ripley, will you
marry me for real?

33:56.710 --> 33:59.119
God.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.539
I just... I just...
I just proposed.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.329
Vic... No, no. Don't answer.

34:03.330 --> 34:05.579
Not... Not yet 'cause,
um... you know what?

34:05.580 --> 34:07.209
Take a minute
and think about it.

34:07.210 --> 34:10.879
Um, I just... My God.
Answer me later.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.998
This is insane, so let's talk about
this later. Okay, okay, okay.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.918
We could meet at our "place"
in the morning for breakfast,

34:16.920 --> 34:18.539
and we'll talk then, okay?

34:18.540 --> 34:19.579
Yeah, that's better.
Bre... you know, breakfast.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.918
Breakfast is better. Okay.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.248
I'll see you at the diner?

34:23.250 --> 34:25.710
Yep. Great. Okeydokey.

34:29.880 --> 34:30.918
What was all that?

34:30.920 --> 34:32.748
I just proposed.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.829
Stop rubbing all your hearts
and rainbows all over me.

34:34.830 --> 34:36.210
And stop all
your stupid smiling.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.879
And then boom...

34:49.880 --> 34:52.248
She just cut the dude's
chest open on the spot.

34:52.250 --> 34:53.539
I know. I was there.

34:53.540 --> 34:55.039
You don't have
to keep talking about it.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.418
It all crystallized for me
out there, all right?

34:56.420 --> 34:58.669
I-I got it right
when it counted...

34:58.670 --> 34:59.959
Can't overthink it, all right?

34:59.960 --> 35:01.829
Just... Just got to go for it.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.190
Sounds like you have a real
crush on this Medic One program.

35:05.210 --> 35:06.709
I'm not the only one
with a crush.

35:06.710 --> 35:07.749
Hey, Miller,

35:07.750 --> 35:09.749
you gonna call your girl?

35:09.750 --> 35:11.119
I don't know.
I was thinking about it.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.120
Don't overthink it.

35:13.670 --> 35:16.079
Yeah, things get overcomplicated
all by themselves.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.379
Trust me. Okay, so...

35:17.380 --> 35:18.709
So you're saying
I should go for it?

35:18.710 --> 35:21.039
Psh! Or don't.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.329
The more free time you have,

35:22.330 --> 35:24.039
the more you can
spend quizzing me.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.830
So...

35:32.960 --> 35:34.289
Hi, Nikki.

35:34.290 --> 35:36.250
Yeah, yeah. It, -
It's Dean Miller.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.539
You avoided me all night.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.080
Well, I'm here now.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.460
I meant to tell you.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.999
Gibson and I...
We started as... nothing.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.039
I thought you and I'd probably
wind up laughing about it,

36:34.040 --> 36:36.459
I mean, it's Gibson,
of all people,

36:36.460 --> 36:37.789
and then, by the time
it was something...

36:37.790 --> 36:41.169
But how? How did you
and Jack become anything?

36:41.170 --> 36:45.459
I really... I-I-I-I don't...
I don't even know.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.289
It's just something
clicked with us.

36:47.290 --> 36:49.499
He's not what
I expected underneath.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.619
He's... He...
He doesn't pour his heart out.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.169
He doesn't trust easily,
but he trusts me,

36:53.170 --> 36:54.419
and that made me trust him...

36:54.420 --> 36:55.500
I trust you.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.540
I guess I didn't
think that you...

37:01.290 --> 37:04.579
Do you still... like him or...?

37:04.580 --> 37:06.170
No.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.249
No, no!

37:09.250 --> 37:10.959
I'm not... I'm not
jealous here, Maya.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.879
I'm... I'm not even mad exactly,

37:13.880 --> 37:15.619
but... but you two have been...

37:15.620 --> 37:18.829
You've been doing all this
right under my nose

37:18.830 --> 37:20.709
and didn't even think
enough of me to tell me?

37:20.710 --> 37:22.670
We were going to tell you.
But you didn't.

37:25.830 --> 37:28.669
I-I-I don't even have
the right words.

37:28.670 --> 37:31.879
I just... I'm...

37:31.880 --> 37:33.749
I'm humiliated.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.419
You humiliated me.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.000
I didn't want to do that.
But you did.

37:39.540 --> 37:41.920
I'm so sorry.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.959
It's not good enough.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.459
Do better.

37:46.460 --> 37:50.039
You and I... we...
We are better than this.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.669
You are mad.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.619
Okay, yeah. I am.

37:53.620 --> 37:57.170
Herrera, Dispatch just came in
with an Aid Car call.

37:58.250 --> 38:00.669
That's you, me, and Warren.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.829
Bishop,

38:02.830 --> 38:05.039
the rest of you are heading back
to the coffee-fire site.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.880
They need help with overhaul.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.330
We should get a move on.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.209
There's a moment
right before a flashover begins

38:18.210 --> 38:19.330
where everything goes quiet.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.499
Some firefighters swear

38:31.500 --> 38:33.670
it feels like
time is standing still.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.379
Like every sound, every detail,

38:40.380 --> 38:42.040
every inch of your body's
on high alert.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.329
Yeah.

38:47.330 --> 38:48.580
I could use an opinion.

38:50.330 --> 38:52.079
Which one of these says,

38:52.080 --> 38:54.120
"I want to spend the rest
of my life with you"?

38:55.380 --> 38:58.459
That seems like a lot of
pressure to put on some flowers.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.749
Maybe I should
just go with roses.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.579
But I mean, are... are roses...
Are roses enough?

39:03.580 --> 39:05.579
Maybe I should get roses
and something else.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.749
I've been
standing here for five minutes,

39:07.750 --> 39:09.169
trying to decide the same thing.

39:09.170 --> 39:12.249
Do you think that these say,

39:12.250 --> 39:13.730
"I'm really sorry
you killed someone"?

39:16.250 --> 39:19.329
No, it's...
It's not... I'm a doctor.

39:19.330 --> 39:22.249
They're for another doctor
who, -

39:22.250 --> 39:24.249
it's... it's a long story.

39:24.250 --> 39:25.669
I think the roses,

39:25.670 --> 39:29.749
and maybe some of these big,
fancy ones would be great.

39:29.750 --> 39:31.710
Smart guy. Thanks.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.709
And I forgot my wallet. Genius.

39:42.710 --> 39:43.959
Here, I got it.

39:43.960 --> 39:44.790
No, no. You don't have to.

39:44.791 --> 39:46.959
Today seems special.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.959
It should be special.

39:49.960 --> 39:51.539
I hope it goes great.

39:51.540 --> 39:54.079
Thank you.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.670
I hope your thing
goes well, too.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.539
Your instincts can sense

39:58.540 --> 39:59.980
what your brain
hasn't processed yet.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.960
You feel it in your bones.

40:24.830 --> 40:27.209
Heard we got called back in
to help with overhaul.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.119
What are you doing here?
What happened with, -

40:29.120 --> 40:31.289
Nothing happened.
He didn't show.

40:31.290 --> 40:33.169
Now I'm getting
back to work, okay?

40:33.170 --> 40:34.329
I need to work.

40:34.330 --> 40:36.580
You get out of there...

40:41.500 --> 40:44.170
so you don't get hit.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.209
Somebody call 911!

40:54.210 --> 40:55.810
Tell them we need
an ambulance right now!

40:56.880 --> 40:59.000
So maybe you'll survive.
