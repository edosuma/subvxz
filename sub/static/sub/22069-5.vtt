WEBVTT

00:06.174 --> 00:07.241
See you Monday,
Dr. Vega.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.742
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.343
Get in.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.953
Where's Adam Radford?

00:53.020 --> 00:56.324
He's fine.
I left him safe,
police found him.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.558
Are you expecting
anyone else?

00:57.625 --> 01:00.628
Just, uh,
cleaning staff at 6:00.

01:00.694 --> 01:01.762
Good. Take a seat.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.170
Don't move.
Oh!

01:09.237 --> 01:11.739
Why are you doing this?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.677
I need your help
and I need to buy some time.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.146
Okay, feet together.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.484
Now, where's my file?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.552
Over there.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.290
It's locked.
Where's the key?

01:29.357 --> 01:31.625
In the desk.
The first... Right.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.129
What are you looking for?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.097
Everyone thinks
that I am behind this

01:37.165 --> 01:39.533
and it's blinding them
to the truth.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.302
Somebody else
is behind this.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.337
And I thought that Radford
would have a few answers.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.005
Turns out he did.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.407
In fact, he gave me a clue

01:46.474 --> 01:47.741
and I need you to help me
make sense of it.

01:47.808 --> 01:51.279
Hey, look, I don't think
you killed those people.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.781
But my advice for you
is to turn yourself in.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.249
I can't.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.151
Too close
to solving this.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.120
I need your help, Doctor.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.855
How can I help?

02:02.690 --> 02:03.691
Bleeding eye.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.559
It's a place.

02:07.328 --> 02:10.598
Except I can't remember
where it was. I saw it
when I was a kid.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.965
I just...

02:12.032 --> 02:13.301
Did I ever mention it?

02:13.367 --> 02:16.036
No, I... You can look
through your file,

02:16.103 --> 02:17.605
but I don't think so.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.840
You think this place
has something to do

02:19.907 --> 02:21.509
with your abduction?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.511
I don't know.
I'll know when I see it.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.947
Okay.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.883
I'm going to ask you
to do something

02:29.950 --> 02:31.485
that might sound
impossible,

02:31.552 --> 02:33.954
given the state
you're in right now...

02:34.021 --> 02:35.389
Hey! Stop.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.559
And breathe.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.197
Thank you. Relax.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.773
That's right.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.575
Thank you.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.644
Relax.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.613
Concentrate on your vision.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.284
Take your time.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.488
That's it.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.523
Okay.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.284
You okay?

03:37.184 --> 03:38.619
Yeah, I will be.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.391
Just a scrape.

03:45.693 --> 03:46.727
Thanks in there.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.795
Yeah.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.265
No vest?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.233
Didn't think I was walking
into a shoot-out.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.538
I guess you know
her better than I do.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.974
I wanted to
bring her in alive.

04:02.876 --> 04:03.877
If I could.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.779
So much for that.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.289
DR. VEGA: Describe your vision.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.361
Describe the place
we're looking for.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.544
It's a tree.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.351
It's smooth and white.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.822
It's an aspen.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.630
I'm there with other children.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.298
DR. VEGA: From the orphanage?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.501
Yeah.

05:00.568 --> 05:04.705
And we're spinning
around a tree.

05:06.940 --> 05:07.975
EMILY: We're singing.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.878
I'm with friends.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.749
I feel happy.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.587
DR. VEGA:
Stay there. Breathe. Deep.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.590
Breathe on.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.425
Stay there, with your friends.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.663
EMILY:
There's a fog coming in.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.974
Thank you, Doctor.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.276
You know where it is?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.447
Yeah. But you know
I can't tell you.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.817
You're duty bound
to tell the police.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.652
No.
But I really need
a head start.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.553
Hey.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.722
Okay, now... Hey!

05:54.788 --> 05:56.624
Cleaning crew comes at 6:00.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.795
Yes, sir.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.432
I think somebody's dealing
with that as we speak.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.402
Yeah, sure.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.042
Congratulations.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.612
It's a temporary assignment.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.583
Am I fired?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.685
Seriously, Durand?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.023
I'm sorry.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.068
Adam?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.139
Why do you think
she killed him?

06:46.206 --> 06:50.544
I mean, I get Semerov
and I sure as hell
get Harlow, but...

06:55.415 --> 06:58.285
I know why
she killed Adam.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.054
She thought that he had been
holding her in that cabin.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.190
What?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.559
It's crazy. I know.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.028
I kept trying
to talk her off of it.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.930
She wouldn't hear it.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.233
That's what she was
raving on and on about

07:13.300 --> 07:14.635
when she ran off on me.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.037
How the hell did
she get that idea?

08:11.491 --> 08:14.528
I didn't want to
drag you into it
more than you already were.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.699
Now you see where going
after Adam got me.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.202
I really thought

08:22.269 --> 08:24.271
that I could
bring her in
and end this.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.506
You still think that?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.885
I want you to be
our point person with BPD.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.888
Work with Tommy
to bring Emily in safely.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.356
I don't know.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.525
Nobody knows
her mind like you do.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.294
She's not the woman I knew.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.163
Come on, Nick.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.040
Okay.

09:00.107 --> 09:04.411
Good. We need to
bring her in before
anyone else gets hurt.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.615
We're gonna keep
this stuff about Radford
to ourselves for now.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.617
After we bring Emily in,

09:09.683 --> 09:11.885
we'll go to Internal Affairs
about Radford together.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.158
And, Nick...

09:20.994 --> 09:25.232
Your loyalty is to me now.
Not Tommy or anyone else.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.768
No secrets. We clear?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.103
Yeah.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.754
I'll be ready.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.957
Did she kill Adam?

09:53.994 --> 09:54.995
My God.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.699
It's my fault.

09:59.867 --> 10:03.971
Everything she does
from here on out, it's on me.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.608
I'm gonna take a shower.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.674
Did you sleep with her?

10:43.877 --> 10:46.714
The night she escaped,
did you sleep with her?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.290
Are you in love with her?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.331
Part of me
will always love her.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.884
When does the next bus
leave for Colebrook?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.786
At 9:00 p.m.
Making all stops.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.254
Manchester,
Concord, Plymouth,

12:34.321 --> 12:36.289
Whitefield,
Lancaster, Colebrook.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.590
When's it get in?

12:37.657 --> 12:39.526
1:00 a.m.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.862
Four hours?
Making all stops.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.800
Okay.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.535
Twenty, thirty...
There you go.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.736
Thanks.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.708
Yeah?

12:55.775 --> 12:56.977
I didn't kill Radford.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.746
NICK: Emily?
Where the hell are you?

12:59.813 --> 13:01.982
Look, I left him alive.
He was alive.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.851
Where are you?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.319
Listen.
You're both in danger.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.856
I don't know
how he found me there,
but he did.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.723
And he could be
watching you and Flynn.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.459
You need help.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.526
You're not well.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.662
Just tell me where you are.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.164
Would you just
listen to me?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.199
He is going to hurt you.
He is going to hurt Flynn.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.234
Please, Nick,
I am getting close.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.136
The only thing that you
are getting closer to, Emily,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.138
is getting shot
dead in the street.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.707
Think about our son.

13:27.774 --> 13:29.242
I am.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.011
I'm not going
to let him grow up
thinking I'm a murderer.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.546
I would rather die
trying to clear my name.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.816
Somebody killed all
of those people
and I'm gonna find out who.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.519
This is not the way.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.988
This is not
the way, Emily.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.722
If you want to catch
this person,

13:42.789 --> 13:45.158
you need
to turn yourself in.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.896
I'm sorry, Nick.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.098
I can't do that.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.424
CROWN: What's up?

14:17.490 --> 14:18.825
It's me.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.193
She called.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.377
Look at the evidence, Dad.
We have to consider it's her.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.344
It's not true.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.879
The facts speak
for themselves, Dad.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.382
Don't condescend to me, boy.
Don't you know your own sister?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.150
She's your family,
for God's sake.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.818
See, that's the problem
right there.

15:18.885 --> 15:22.355
You haven't considered that
maybe I know her and you don't?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.058
You didn't come here
out of care for me.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.727
You came because
you couldn't wait to tell me

15:27.794 --> 15:29.496
when your sister disappeared.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.199
That's bullshit
and you know it.
I am here because of you.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.134
Last time nearly killed you.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.903
As you can see, I didn't
keel over from the shock.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.938
So, you can go.
Go celebrate.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.607
You're drinking again.
I can tell.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.775
The great detective
strikes again.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.478
Or maybe Emily
ratted me out to you
and you're covering for her.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.114
You mean after
you threw her out?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.815
Of course
you'd think that.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.517
It's you and her
against the world.
It always has been.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.986
The rest of us
can go to hell.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.687
Well, don't worry,
I know the way.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.193
Look, Dad, please,

16:00.260 --> 16:03.263
she's going to reach out
to you somehow
and when she does,

16:04.097 --> 16:05.298
just turn her in.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.200
Just turn her in.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.709
Filthy junkie.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.515
It was a bad dream. Sorry.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.734
CROWN: Based on Nicks' account
of this conversation they had,

17:14.801 --> 17:17.537
it sounds like she's not
targeting anyone right now.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.307
Unless
we are dealing
with a split personality.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.542
NICK: That's
a bit extreme, Dr. Vega.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.810
What do you mean?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.380
You said she thought

17:27.447 --> 17:30.483
the killer was
right on her heels.

17:30.550 --> 17:35.355
Maybe we should consider
that she's both

17:35.422 --> 17:38.458
the killer and
the investigator
hunting that killer.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.594
With all
due respect, Doctor,

17:41.661 --> 17:43.330
wouldn't you have
flagged this condition

17:43.396 --> 17:44.897
in all your time
with her?

17:44.964 --> 17:46.766
Not necessarily.

17:46.833 --> 17:52.972
I'd have to see
that side of her
to know it existed.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.941
I may have only seen one side.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.511
Okay, the one thing
we know for sure is
we have to find her.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.348
Now, Dr. Vega said
wherever she's going,

18:01.414 --> 18:03.015
it's tied to her childhood.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.752
And that vision
she's been having
since her return.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.320
Yes, the eye.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.357
Crying a tear of blood.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.525
She worked out
that it was a tree.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.428
She'd played there
with other children.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.997
We need to speak
to her brother
and father.

18:18.064 --> 18:22.535
Or you might need
to go back deep into her past.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.037
She was adopted.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.307
And ask people what?

18:27.374 --> 18:30.143
"Did Emily ever play
near a tree?"

18:30.210 --> 18:31.944
NICK: No. She still thinks
she's on a case.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.413
She's going from clue to clue.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.783
And that tree, that place,
that's her next clue.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.387
We find it, we find her.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.054
Okay, you two
take the brother and father,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.623
we'll look into
the orphanage.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.739
OFFICER:
Excuse me, ma'am.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.542
I heard a complaint from
a passenger on the bus.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.713
English.
Do you speak English?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.482
No. No English.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.526
The silent treatment
you're giving us

20:59.592 --> 21:02.929
only puts your daughter at
greater risk. You know that.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.066
NICK: Warren,
just help us end this.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.335
For everyone.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.703
Think of
your grandson.

21:17.243 --> 21:18.411
You know how
this is going to end

21:18.478 --> 21:20.513
unless I'm the one
that gets to her first.

21:27.820 --> 21:32.592
Just help us
with this tree thing.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.662
She played there
as a child.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.565
She remembers
other children there, singing.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.501
Could it have been
a family vacation.
School trip.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.005
You can help us out
just by saying no.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.742
Then we can get started looking
into her time at Barrett House.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.816
Don't sit here and lie to me
like you care about her.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.653
Six years
she was out there.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.856
Took only one before
you threw in the towel.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.659
Nothing would have stopped me
if it were my wife.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.429
Remarried?

22:10.863 --> 22:13.466
You're a poor excuse
for a man. Get out.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.437
Let's go.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.038
We'll try the brother.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.107
Sure, go see that traitor.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.542
Just like this one here.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.611
Quick to throw her
under a bus.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.748
Warren, she killed
an FBI agent.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.418
Did you see her
pull the trigger?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.486
She shot at
Detective Gibbs and me.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.987
I taught her
to shoot myself.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.689
If she shot at you,
you'd be dead.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.025
Put that in your file.

22:39.091 --> 22:42.462
I was there when you made
your vows, you coward.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.330
I heard you say
those vows to her.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.565
A man keeps his vows.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.534
Now get the hell out
of my room!

25:01.701 --> 25:05.071
You're looking for a park
we used to play in as kids?

25:05.137 --> 25:10.176
Her doctor said
that she remembered
other kids with her.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.811
They were all singing.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.648
Well, I wasn't one of them.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.917
Jack, anything
you can remember
might help.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.451
Guys, seriously
I want to help. I do.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.189
But I don't remember
anything from back then, okay?

25:23.255 --> 25:24.490
I was a kid.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.292
Seriously, you should
talk to my dad.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.931
How was their relationship,
your father and sister?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.002
She was the son
he never had.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.537
Hmm.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.274
Did they play
sports together?

25:42.341 --> 25:45.845
He'd take her out
to play catch, hit a ball,
something like that?

25:47.179 --> 25:49.315
Maybe some place
close to your house?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.517
No. She was into track.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.286
When my parents
first adopted her

25:54.353 --> 25:56.923
she always use to talk
about running away.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.226
I didn't know that.

26:00.292 --> 26:03.129
Oh, yeah. Yeah, constantly.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.396
Was she unhappy?

26:04.463 --> 26:06.198
No. No, it was quite
the opposite.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.967
She couldn't handle
being happy.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.201
It was like
she thought it was

26:09.268 --> 26:10.703
all going to
fall apart any second

26:10.770 --> 26:12.872
and that my parents were
going to kick her out

26:12.939 --> 26:14.173
or I was
plotting against her.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.809
So, I guess she figured
she might as well just

26:16.876 --> 26:18.845
reject my whole family first.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.649
NICK: Did she ever run away?

26:22.715 --> 26:26.686
No. No. She did not.
It was all talk.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.920
Threats.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.823
Got her a lot of
attention, though.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.026
She ever say
where she'd run to?

26:35.461 --> 26:36.729
No.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.998
I mean, as a kid,
she used to joke about

26:39.065 --> 26:43.202
going to live with
her merry men
in Sherwood Forest.

26:43.269 --> 26:47.473
You know,
she loved Robin Hood.
I remember that.

26:47.539 --> 26:51.343
But somehow, I don't think
she's on a plane
to England right now.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.945
Maybe there's...

27:02.855 --> 27:04.056
I don't believe it.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.958
You don't believe what?

27:06.025 --> 27:09.061
Thank you, Jack.
Thank you. This might work.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.798
What did you find?

27:11.864 --> 27:13.399
Let's go.
What did he find?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.067
Yeah.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.202
Thank you, man.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.307
Okay.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.053
Do you know of
an old amusement park

30:21.120 --> 30:22.922
up I-93 called
Nottingham Park?

30:22.989 --> 30:24.456
TROOPER: Yeah,
it's 40 minutes up the road,

30:24.523 --> 30:25.691
just outside Colebrook.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.927
Thirty if you have
a State Trooper escort.

30:28.727 --> 30:29.728
Which we do?

30:29.795 --> 30:31.130
TROOPER: Sure thing.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.040
Fuck!

31:33.926 --> 31:35.127
Kill the lights.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.577
TROOPER: Agent Durand! Here!

32:32.318 --> 32:33.319
Jesus.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.635
The decomp on this body
is 10 years old.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.702
At least.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.407
Christ, that's long
before she was taken.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.422
Nick.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.260
She knew where to dig.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.133
TROOPER: We found her tracks.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.013
Okay.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.525
I need as many troopers
as you can get.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.627
I want roadblocks
in all directions.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.014
I say we focus
on the border.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.282
Not so sure.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.451
I don't think
she's running.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.655
Check the borders anyway.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.590
We'll needs to comb
those woods with the dogs.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.227
I'd say a five-mile radius
from the grave.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.829
Call them in.
We need more manpower, too.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.453
Hi, Park View General Hospital.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.521
OPERATOR: Boston area?

37:02.588 --> 37:04.490
Yeah, cardiopulmonary surgery.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.292
I got it. Connect you?

37:06.358 --> 37:08.294
Okay. Connect me. Thanks.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.598
RECEPTIONIST: Cardiopulmonary.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.134
Hi, yes this is
Katherine Carbonne, B-Tronic.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.202
Good morning.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.270
How you doing this morning?

37:18.337 --> 37:19.538
Ready for my break.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.340
I know,
I had an early start, too.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.174
Look, I'm calling you
about one of our devices

37:23.241 --> 37:26.278
that a patient of yours
received a few years ago.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.079
There might be
a problem with the device

37:28.146 --> 37:31.450
and I was wondering if we could
get a contact for that patient

37:31.517 --> 37:32.751
because we're going to need it.

37:32.818 --> 37:33.819
I can email you

37:33.885 --> 37:34.886
the request
for information form

37:34.953 --> 37:35.954
but I can't...

37:36.021 --> 37:37.523
I know. I understand, but...

37:37.589 --> 37:40.025
I have the serial number
right here, so we can just...

37:40.091 --> 37:41.593
We need the form.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.895
Is there some way you can get
the information on your end?

37:43.962 --> 37:46.832
It's not at our end.
Otherwise I wouldn't
be calling you.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.534
Well,
I can only send you the form.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.768
Well, this is a matter that

37:49.835 --> 37:51.437
could seriously affect
the patient's life,

37:51.503 --> 37:53.572
so I think we can place
that above protocol, don't you?

37:53.639 --> 37:55.907
We really can't.
It's federal policy.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.644
You know how these rules are.
I just follow them.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.379
Is there a supervisor
that I can talk to?

38:00.446 --> 38:01.747
You can talk to my supervisor,

38:01.813 --> 38:03.214
but she'll give you
the same answer.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.282
Should I connect you?

38:04.350 --> 38:05.551
No. Okay.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.486
Sorry.
I understand.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.455
Thank you.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.097
Hey, listen up! Listen up!

38:52.163 --> 38:54.533
We are looking for
a white female, 5'9".

40:37.503 --> 40:39.505
TRUCKER:
Let's see those hands.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.139
Nice and easy.
