WEBVTT

00:50.551 --> 00:51.461
Yeah.

00:51.469 --> 00:53.334
Yeah, you're right.
They got it all.

00:53.346 --> 00:54.677
Damn it.

00:55.515 --> 00:57.801
Talk to Ray.
He'll know what's going on.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.220
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:00.478 --> 01:03.561
Yo, Lieutenant,
your boys tossed my apartment,

01:03.564 --> 01:05.475
and they snagged a bunch
of my personal stuff.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.269
I want it back.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.892
You're off the Larsen case,
Holder. Let it go.

01:09.904 --> 01:13.192
Besides, county has it now.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.238
County?

01:15.243 --> 01:18.076
Yeah. Transferred.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.570
You and your partner really
screwed the big one on this.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.742
You violated every federal law.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.036
You made a laughing stock
out of this department.

01:25.044 --> 01:28.002
- Yeah.
- You're lucky you kept your badge.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.839
Go home, Holder.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.800
Look...

01:34.804 --> 01:36.886
In a way, it's not your fault.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.506
You had some bad luck
being paired with Linden.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.758
Hey, Linden ain't so bad.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.260
You know she spent a month
in a psych ward?

01:45.064 --> 01:48.147
Completely lost it
working on a case.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.983
I wouldn't put my career
in her hands if I were you.

01:50.987 --> 01:53.478
My advice...
Find yourself a new partner.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.151
Like I said...

01:56.158 --> 01:58.649
I'm just looking for my stuff.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.993
So who do | talk to at county?

03:14.070 --> 03:16.561
No one's there?
It's only 8:00.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.073
What are you county boys
doing down there?

03:18.074 --> 03:20.235
You having a party?

03:20.242 --> 03:23.405
There's got to be someone
in evidence.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.078
Yeah, whatever.

03:26.082 --> 03:28.994
Yeah, yeah...
No, tomorrow's too late!

03:29.877 --> 03:33.040
The mayor must have put Gil
up to this.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.412
We have to get that key.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.800
And how are we gonna get it?
We can't go to Gil.

03:37.635 --> 03:40.342
Then we go around him.
We go around county.

03:40.346 --> 03:41.836
You just got suspended, Linden.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.304
Now you got friends
in high places?

03:52.817 --> 03:56.810
Then Oktoberfest.
At the Ballard Senior Center.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.483
- Old gals love you.
- Four days, Jamie.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.980
We have four days
until the election.

04:00.991 --> 04:04.119
Are you sure a senior center
is our best use of...

04:07.039 --> 04:09.530
Who let you in?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.874
Door was open.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.792
Rosie Larsen was last seen alive
at the Wapi casino.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.249
We need access.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.592
To the casino?

04:21.595 --> 04:23.301
That's on Indian land.

04:23.305 --> 04:27.139
- City has no jurisdiction.
- But you have pull.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.759
lf solving the Larsen case
is truly a priority

04:29.770 --> 04:30.930
as you've said.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.724
l have an election
in four days.

04:32.732 --> 04:34.563
l have many priorities.

04:34.567 --> 04:35.977
Helping us find Rosie's killer

04:35.985 --> 04:38.192
is only gonna improve
your situation, Mr. Richmond.

04:38.446 --> 04:41.028
And you're just here
to lend a helping hand.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.736
We filed a federal warrant,
but that could take months.

04:44.744 --> 04:46.154
You've had to deal
with Chief Jackson

04:46.162 --> 04:47.493
for years on the city council.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.077
Maybe you have a relationship
with her.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.662
My relationship
with Chief Jackson

04:50.666 --> 04:52.577
is no better than yours.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.621
I promise you that, detective.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.165
Chief Jackson does what's best
for Chief Jackson.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.922
Perhaps.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.548
Maybe somebody
should be thinking

05:01.552 --> 05:04.885
about that dead 17-year-old girl
and her family.

05:05.556 --> 05:08.172
Good luck with the election,
councilman.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.853
Man, I still got
a few amigos down in county.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.691
I'll make a few calls
first thing,

05:19.695 --> 05:21.481
see if I can track down
our case files.

05:23.616 --> 05:26.949
Holder, I'm sorry.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.908
We shouldn't have split up.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.330
It happened.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.199
We're good, Linden.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.749
You're still my BFF.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.545
Where you going now?

05:43.886 --> 05:46.423
Still staying
at that $120 a night

05:46.430 --> 05:48.341
flop joint you call a hotel?

05:48.349 --> 05:50.681
Get out of my car.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.770
Holder.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.730
Thanks.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.191
And thanks for being there
for Jack.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.837
Jack.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.117
Hi.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.330
Mitch? Wow.

07:45.341 --> 07:49.675
|-| wasn't sure
that I could find you, David.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.055
| just had this old address,
and...

07:52.556 --> 07:54.547
I don't... I'm...
I should have called first.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.674
I'm so sorry.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.301
You're here because of Rosie.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.941
It was like seeing you
at that age.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.106
It completely threw me.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.480
I knew she was yours before
she even opened her mouth.

08:15.287 --> 08:19.371
I had no idea
she was coming up here.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.785
She never said anything to me.

08:20.793 --> 08:21.782
Teenagers, right?

08:21.794 --> 08:24.001
Their whole lives
are based on secrets.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.619
She'll tell you eventually.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.297
Yeah.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.047
What did she want?

08:37.059 --> 08:40.051
Why was she making a four-hour
bus trip to Blaine?

08:40.062 --> 08:40.767
I don't know.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.604
I kept wondering
the same thing myself.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.687
You know, honestly,

08:44.692 --> 08:46.102
I think she just
wanted to talk to someone

08:46.110 --> 08:48.226
who knew mom before.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.986
Before what?

08:50.990 --> 08:52.275
Before life happened,

08:52.282 --> 08:54.568
before, you know,
you became her mom.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.739
She seems angry, Mitch.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.032
S—she... and, um...

09:00.040 --> 09:02.497
She seems a...
little lost.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.790
I guess you guys are having
a hard time, huh?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.923
Your girl's really...

09:12.803 --> 09:14.543
Honest...

09:14.555 --> 09:16.796
And direct.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.053
Just like you were.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.267
What did you tell her about me?

09:22.271 --> 09:25.354
I told her you always had a book
in your hand.

09:26.442 --> 09:27.773
And...

09:27.776 --> 09:30.438
Um... oh, that you...
that you liked...

09:30.446 --> 09:32.937
Really crappy movies

09:32.948 --> 09:34.939
like...

09:35.451 --> 09:37.612
What was that one... What was
that one about the whale?

09:38.871 --> 09:39.951
"Free Willy"

09:39.955 --> 09:41.286
Oh, no, no, no.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.498
Yeah.
She knew that.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.002
I didn't tell her
about the pot.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.417
But I did say that you weren't
afraid of anything.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.586
That time we went to see
Soundgarden

09:53.594 --> 09:55.300
and you insisted on jumping

09:55.304 --> 09:56.714
right in the middle
of the mosh pit.

09:57.848 --> 10:00.965
Head banging...
Body slamming and all.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.137
- You told her that?
- She loved it.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.136
She couldn't believe
you were that person.

10:05.147 --> 10:08.105
She had no idea.
Kids never do, I guess.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.814
She wanted to know
if we were in love.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.166
How could you not know
your daughter was a prostitute?

10:28.170 --> 10:29.535
What kind of parent are you?

10:31.632 --> 10:34.123
Hey, I think
I've seen your daughter

10:34.134 --> 10:36.546
Is there like a double reward
if you ﬁnd her..

10:37.971 --> 10:39.472
Mr. Larsen,

10:39.473 --> 10:41.759
this is Principal Rosenstein
from Woodridge Elementary.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.133
Your son Tommy's been involved

10:44.144 --> 10:47.102
in a serious incident
this morning.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.689
What are you doing?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.156
I've been looking
all over for you.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.492
Hotel front desk said
you weren't in your room.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.157
You been sleeping here
all night?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.371
What time is it?

11:07.126 --> 11:08.241
It's 8:30, Linden.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.868
I told you
you could crash at my place.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.795
What's going on?

11:13.799 --> 11:15.460
I talked to my guy at county.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.923
And get this...

11:16.927 --> 11:19.168
Evidence isn't there.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.635
Never showed up.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.880
They don't know nothing
about it.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.844
What?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.843
The Larsen case files, Linden.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.846
They're gone.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.010
What the...?

12:04.266 --> 12:06.302
Hey, Gil.

12:07.853 --> 12:08.968
What are you doing here?

12:08.979 --> 12:10.890
This is arrabbiata, right?

12:14.193 --> 12:15.774
What?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.985
This is arrabbiata?
Penne all'arrabbiata?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.695
It's damn good, too.
What'd you put in this?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.280
Holder.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.817
What do you want, Holder?

12:25.495 --> 12:27.486
Larsen case files.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.872
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.083
I think you do.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.166
You know what "arrabbiata"
means in Italian?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.343
Hmm? "Angry."

12:45.557 --> 12:48.264
Although in my case it would
be more like "pissed off. "

12:48.268 --> 12:50.304
You get the hell
out of my place.

12:50.312 --> 12:53.179
You know what a low-life tweaker
does when he gets pissed?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.599
You don't have the balls.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.938
Oh, damn.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.901
Got to go, Gil.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.364
Hey, it was great catching up.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.657
And thanks for the leftovers,
man. It was real good.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.540
You know,
timing's everything, Habib.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.879
You feel me?

13:20.217 --> 13:23.050
And the time will come.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.091
Like the good book says...

13:27.975 --> 13:30.466
An eye for an eye.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.684
We ain't done, my brother.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.615
He don't have the files.
Not in his apartment.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.954
You sure?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.573
I tossed it good.
It's not there.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.960
You get anything from his car?

13:55.961 --> 13:56.950
Yeah.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.168
Oh, snap, Linden.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.662
You finally figured out
how to work the slim Jim, huh?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.210
Gil's last five
locations...

14:02.217 --> 14:04.924
1262 Healey Ave.
Everett, Washington.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.214
30 miles away.
That's where he went last night.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.883
Everett.

14:09.558 --> 14:12.345
Maybe... he stashed
the Larsen files

14:12.352 --> 14:13.967
in the middle of nowhere.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.844
Wait till everyone
loses interest.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.768
Rosie Larsen becomes
just another cold case.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.185
Let's go.

14:26.658 --> 14:30.492
We propose using
this waterfront property

14:30.495 --> 14:33.953
to build a Northwest American
Indian museum and gift shop.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.373
A place that honors
the rich legacy

14:36.376 --> 14:38.332
and history of our people.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.498
I certainly have
no objection to that.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.082
Good.

14:42.466 --> 14:47.460
I'm not sure mayor Adams and |
see eye to eye on this.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.131
Truth be told,

14:49.139 --> 14:52.006
we'd rather be in partnership
with you on it.

14:52.017 --> 14:55.930
This would include
my endorsement of your campaign.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.268
Of course.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.348
And in return?

15:00.359 --> 15:02.020
Simply put,

15:02.027 --> 15:05.064
we want you as mayor
to endorse legislation

15:05.072 --> 15:07.529
granting tax-exempt status
to all our land

15:07.532 --> 15:09.523
found within the city limits.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.276
So, you are asking
for tax-exempt status

15:12.287 --> 15:13.197
for the museum.

15:13.205 --> 15:16.413
And anything built
on our property.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.081
Ah, let me ask you a question.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.249
As you may imagine,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.963
I am eager to put
the Larsen case behind me,

15:26.510 --> 15:28.546
as we approach election day.

15:29.388 --> 15:32.300
Seattle police seem to feel
this won't be possible

15:32.307 --> 15:34.514
without getting
into your casino...

15:34.518 --> 15:36.554
Where the girl was last seen.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.977
As a sign of good faith,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.266
I'd like you
to give them access.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.562
Your police have no place
on sovereign Indian land.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.360
It would set
a terrible precedent.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.568
Please understand that I speak
for the American Indian Nation

15:50.575 --> 15:51.530
when I say this.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.947
I don't think so.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.366
I think you speak
for yourself...

15:56.373 --> 15:58.910
Miss Jackson.

15:58.917 --> 16:03.081
Always have.
That much is clear.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.703
Darren,
I'm sure that we can...

16:04.714 --> 16:06.454
This conversation is over.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.915
Your choice.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.042
Good luck with the election.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.090
You're saying he killed a bird?

16:13.098 --> 16:14.508
Three fledglings.

16:14.516 --> 16:15.972
Tommy and some friends

16:15.976 --> 16:17.807
found a bird's nest
near the swings.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.096
When they knocked it off,

16:19.104 --> 16:20.594
there were some
baby birds inside.

16:20.605 --> 16:21.685
Starlings.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.646
Tommy then proceeded
to step on them.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.935
Stomp on them.

16:24.943 --> 16:28.686
Until Miss Herman observed this
and intervened.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.066
Well...

16:31.908 --> 16:33.990
That certainly
doesn't sound like Tommy.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.905
He loves animals.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.619
But, um, I will have a talk
with him.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.620
Mr. Larsen,
we're concerned about your son.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.084
Killing animals can be
a warning sign.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.168
Come on.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.913
Boys will be boys, right?

16:47.924 --> 16:49.960
I mean,
sometimes they do dumb stuff.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.085
Killing defenseless creatures
is not just "dumb stuff."

16:53.305 --> 16:56.012
- It's a cruel and violent act.
- No.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.133
My daughter being murdered
three weeks ago...

16:59.311 --> 17:01.802
That was a cruel
and violent act.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.974
This...
This is just stupid!

17:05.942 --> 17:07.478
Mr. Larsen...

17:07.944 --> 17:09.980
Tommy is suspended
for two weeks.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.400
- Maybe during that time...
- Two weeks?

17:12.407 --> 17:14.022
That's... that's crazy.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.570
How am I gonna work
with a kid at home?

17:15.577 --> 17:17.909
My wife...

17:18.246 --> 17:20.862
My wife is out of town.
It's just me.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.956
It's just me trying to
hold it all together there.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.745
I'm sorry.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.623
I know this has been hard
for your family,

17:28.089 --> 17:29.875
though we can't just let this go.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.750
Tommy really needs
to think about his actions.

17:36.848 --> 17:41.342
1262 Healey Ave., Everett.
This is it?

17:42.479 --> 17:45.516
Maybe he got hungry.
Gil loves him some gyro.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.269
Oh, this was a waste of time.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.359
Wait, wait.
I've been here before.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.864
At that Greek joint.
With Gil.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.949
That's good to know.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.864
Come on.
Let's get back on the freeway.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.577
No,
h-hold on, Linden.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.072
Gil took me there when l was
helping him move his crap out

18:04.084 --> 18:06.040
after his old lady
kicked him out of the house.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.329
Move it where?

18:07.963 --> 18:09.419
To his storage locker,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.208
which happens to be
right around back.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.470
You've got to be kidding me.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.218
Why'd you think
she kicked him out?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.810
You take the front,
I'll take the back.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.816
What'd you do?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.735
Shut up, ass wipe.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.113
Come on, move it!
I got to get back to work!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.782
You know what a pain
in the ass this is?

18:42.789 --> 18:44.700
How am I supposed to work
when you're in at the house

18:44.708 --> 18:46.744
for two weeks, damn it?

18:46.918 --> 18:49.375
I'll tell you something
right now, kid.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.494
You better shape up,

18:50.505 --> 18:52.461
or your life's gonna become
a nightmare.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.922
For starters, you can forget
about Halloween.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.462
No parties, no trick or treating.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.458
What?!

18:57.470 --> 18:58.459
You heard me.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.007
Too much going on in my life

19:00.015 --> 19:02.222
to have to deal with you
and your bullshit.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.261
You used a bad word, dad.
That's right.

19:04.269 --> 19:07.511
'Cause I'm tired of your brother
and his stupid stunts.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.646
You know what else?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.686
No TV, no video games
for three months.

19:12.694 --> 19:13.774
Get in.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.689
- You have to be kidding me.
- Don't push it!

19:15.697 --> 19:18.439
You would never do something
like this to Rosie.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.281
Because Rosie never pulled
crap like this!

19:20.285 --> 19:22.276
She did a lot worse!

19:22.287 --> 19:24.824
Everybody at school
knows what she did!

19:24.831 --> 19:26.241
Shut your mouth.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.284
I hate her.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.748
And I'm glad she's dead.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.244
I hate you!

19:33.256 --> 19:35.121
- I hate you!
- Tommy, stop.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.419
I wish I could leave you
like mom did!

19:37.427 --> 19:38.758
- I hate you!
- Guess what!

19:38.762 --> 19:41.754
I hate you, too!
You think I want to be here?!

19:41.765 --> 19:44.177
I don't have a choice,
and neither do you!

19:46.353 --> 19:48.014
Now, get in the truck!

19:55.945 --> 19:57.901
Get in the truck, now!

20:19.594 --> 20:21.004
I'll say it the last time,

20:21.012 --> 20:23.424
I'm not making any kind of deal
with that woman.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.514
Darren, you don't owe
these cops anything.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.719
It is insane to throw this away
because of them.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.936
It's not because of them.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.522
I have no intention
of doing business

20:34.526 --> 20:36.482
with that self-serving
charlatan.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.977
She wants to build a museum.
What's the big deal?

20:38.988 --> 20:39.773
You heard her, Jamie.

20:39.781 --> 20:40.941
She reserves the right

20:40.949 --> 20:42.439
to develop anything she wants
on that land.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.906
Not to mention
her refusal of my...

20:43.910 --> 20:46.743
That is a different problem
for a different day.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.032
When you're mayor.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.411
Why are we doing this?

20:53.336 --> 20:54.496
Why are we doing what?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.119
Why are we running
this campaign?

20:56.131 --> 20:57.792
- Why am | running for mayor?
- Oh, Darren.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.289
After everything
that's happened, Jamie,

20:59.300 --> 21:01.507
it has to mean something,
or what's the point?

21:01.511 --> 21:03.877
- First you have to win.
- At what cost?

21:03.888 --> 21:05.549
The chances of you winning

21:05.557 --> 21:07.673
and running
a squeaky-clean campaign

21:07.684 --> 21:10.016
are nil at this point.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.806
I don't believe that.

21:12.814 --> 21:17.228
You do it your way, and see
what happens in four days.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.199
He loves it
when you get idealistic.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.742
I'm gonna lose this thing.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.832
Aren't I?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.128
Your own room, huh?

21:39.132 --> 21:42.624
And an iPod. Wow.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.298
Okay. Well, let me know
what math they put you in.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.637
'Cause you're good at math

21:47.640 --> 21:50.302
and you should be
in honors, okay?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.141
Okay, I will.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.760
I do, too.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.982
Little man okay?

21:59.986 --> 22:01.851
Yeah, he's great.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.198
You know, it's gonna
take more than an iPod

22:11.206 --> 22:12.946
to win him over.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.576
The maid...

22:17.587 --> 22:20.203
is willing to meet us
at the end of her shift,

22:20.215 --> 22:22.581
open the kitchen door
and avoid the cameras.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.048
If we find the key.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.045
You okay, Linden?

22:28.056 --> 22:30.342
I'm fine.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.801
'Cause you know...

22:33.812 --> 22:36.144
You can talk to me.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.479
About whatever.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.817
If you want.
Look, I'm... I'm here.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.191
I know you are.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.201
So, can we find the key now?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.534
Yeah, whatever you say, boss.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.374
It's not in there.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.603
Holder?

23:21.651 --> 23:23.266
Yeah!

23:32.871 --> 23:35.533
Yeah, we were gonna travel
every summer, right?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.995
Peru, India, Europe.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.289
Nothing ever turns out
the way you think it's gonna

23:42.297 --> 23:44.458
when you're young, does it?

23:44.465 --> 23:46.126
Mm-hmm.

23:46.134 --> 23:49.251
Rosie is just like you.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.503
Hey, look,
for what it's worth...

23:51.514 --> 23:54.677
I told Rosie she ought to wait
till she graduates

23:54.684 --> 23:55.924
before taking off.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.096
She didn't want to hear it.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.095
But...

24:00.106 --> 24:01.721
Taking off?

24:03.234 --> 24:06.692
Oh, |-| figured she...
She told you by now.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.647
Told me what?

24:10.658 --> 24:13.195
About the... bus trip
to California,

24:13.202 --> 24:14.612
to see the monarchs.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.862
At the Pacific Grove, I think?

24:16.873 --> 24:20.582
And, uh, from there she was
just gonna play it by ear.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.874
I'm
II
"A.
'3"
oil;

24:25.882 --> 24:28.874
I... I assumed she was
on her way by now.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.046
I told her to be sure
and say goodbye

24:31.054 --> 24:32.385
to everyone that matters.

24:32.388 --> 24:36.347
That people have a hard time
when you just disappear.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.552
She'll tell you, Mitch.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.225
She said she would.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.351
David, I'm so sorry.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.355
You've been so gracious,
but, um, it's really late

24:51.366 --> 24:54.028
and I have to go.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.991
Hey, uh, look,
I'm... I'm sorry

24:55.995 --> 24:58.452
if I said something
I wasn't supposed to.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.822
No. No, no, no.
It's fine.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.414
Everything's...
everything's fine.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.125
It's just, um...
it's just late.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.621
So...

25:08.800 --> 25:09.539
Uh...

25:09.550 --> 25:12.007
Mitch, | just got to ask...

25:16.975 --> 25:19.591
Is she mine?

25:23.398 --> 25:26.185
No, she's Stan's.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.653
It was really good
to see you again, David.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.666
Tommy!
Denny, dinner!

25:50.049 --> 25:52.085
You heard what I said.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.134
I'm not hungry.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.979
I'm sorry I...
lost my temper.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.447
I don't like to get that way.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.828
Tom, why did you hurt
those birds?

26:31.257 --> 26:33.088
I don't know.

26:33.092 --> 26:37.426
Did... did it make you
feel better?

26:37.430 --> 26:39.716
No.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.605
If you go, dad...

26:49.609 --> 26:52.396
Who's gonna take care of us?

26:52.403 --> 26:54.735
Denny, what are you
talking about?

26:54.739 --> 26:57.776
Everybody leaves.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.527
I know you want to go.

27:01.537 --> 27:05.029
I lo...
I love you boys.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.656
Huh?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.999
I love you and...

27:09.003 --> 27:12.086
You will never be alone.
I promise you that.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.669
Does mom still love us?

27:15.676 --> 27:16.665
Yes, of course.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.668
Mom didn't leave
because she doesn't love you.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.419
She left because...

27:21.516 --> 27:24.132
she had stuff
to figure out.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.634
I miss her.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.637
Mom? I know.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.730
I miss Rosie.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.712
Mary's housekeeping shift
gets on at 7:00.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.922
She said she'd prop the doors
open at 10 past.

27:56.926 --> 27:58.166
Good.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.384
Okay, the elevator bank is right
outside the kitchen.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.379
It'll take you about 20 seconds
to get there.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.800
As far as I remember,

28:03.808 --> 28:06.971
there's a camera here, here,
and one inside the elevator,

28:06.978 --> 28:08.514
so you got to keep
your head down.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.978
Security clocks you,
and chances are they will,

28:10.982 --> 28:12.688
crazy horse
and her prairie dogs

28:12.692 --> 28:14.307
are gonna be just
a couple of minutes behind you,

28:14.318 --> 28:16.604
so you got to work fast.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.368
Sure you want to do this?

28:27.290 --> 28:28.655
Yeah.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.000
D.C. didn't agree with you?

28:33.004 --> 28:35.746
Thank you for coming.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.717
You're looking well.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.793
I was intrigued
by your phone call.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.796
- I have a proposal for you.
- A proposal?

28:44.807 --> 28:47.469
I propose you walk away
from any deal with Chief Jackson

28:47.476 --> 28:49.307
and the whole
waterfront project.

28:51.939 --> 28:54.396
My father's always been a...

28:54.400 --> 28:56.812
great fan of yours, Lesley.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.810
- A real supporter.
- Mm.

28:58.821 --> 29:00.777
Couldn't have done it with him.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.317
What's your point?

29:03.159 --> 29:06.196
Your political aspirations
lie beyond this city.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.159
I know you've got your eye

29:07.163 --> 29:09.199
on the seventh
congressional district,

29:09.207 --> 29:13.166
in which case my father's
support will be... essential?

29:15.213 --> 29:16.544
It's late, Gwen.

29:17.465 --> 29:20.832
We can discuss my political
aspirations another time.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.925
After I win this election.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.466
I've been thinking a lot
about the summer

29:25.473 --> 29:27.885
before my freshman year
of high school.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.803
Dad was running for senate.

29:29.810 --> 29:32.017
You were working
on his campaign.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.228
Spent all that time
at our house.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.728
Yeah?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.945
That night after the rally?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.741
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.946
I was 14 years old.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.954
I think maybe
we see events differently.

29:55.962 --> 29:59.204
I wonder how my father
will see it.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.838
You think your father
didn't know?

30:06.973 --> 30:09.464
Jesus.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.511
Richmond must be
really desperate.

30:11.519 --> 30:14.306
To put you up to this?

30:42.967 --> 30:45.299
Yeah.

30:45.303 --> 30:48.591
Why do we have
so many secrets, Stan?

30:52.018 --> 30:55.476
There's so much
we never talked about.

30:57.982 --> 31:00.189
Rosie hadn't been speaking
to us...

31:00.192 --> 31:01.853
For months.

31:01.861 --> 31:06.195
Why did we not ask her
what was wrong?

31:06.198 --> 31:10.066
We did the best
we could, Mitch.

31:12.038 --> 31:15.371
Rosie found a letter that...

31:15.374 --> 31:18.992
I wrote to David
when I was pregnant.

31:19.003 --> 31:22.336
A letter I never sent.

31:22.340 --> 31:25.798
And she went to visit him
a few weeks ago.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.048
And he said that she told him

31:30.056 --> 31:32.172
that she was planning on...

31:35.728 --> 31:38.310
She was leaving.

31:38.689 --> 31:42.181
She was... she was going
on some sort of a trip.

31:42.193 --> 31:44.980
She was leaving, Stan.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.328
How are my boys?

31:57.833 --> 32:01.621
The boys are okay.
How are you?

32:12.223 --> 32:14.384
I got to go, Mitch.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.098
You take care.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.407
Mary,
Detective Linden calling again.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.571
You were supposed to meet us

32:34.578 --> 32:36.034
at the kitchen door
20 minutes ago.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.905
Where are you?
Please call me.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.960
Damn it, she's not coming.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.623
We should give her time.

32:46.674 --> 32:49.791
No, she's not coming.
She's scared.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.644
Stay in the car.
Linden!

33:05.651 --> 33:07.312
Linden, what are you doing?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.059
I'm going in.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.487
That's a bad idea.
Let me go instead.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.197
You just got out
of the hospital.

33:14.201 --> 33:17.284
They're gonna be right on you.
You won't stand a chance.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.619
Watch me.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.455
Stay in the car.

33:53.824 --> 33:57.157
Hey! What's up, guys?!

33:57.161 --> 33:58.822
You winning!
You winning, right?

33:58.829 --> 34:01.320
It's slick Rick
and Johnny Knoxville!

34:01.332 --> 34:03.789
What's up, boy?
How you doing, man?

34:03.792 --> 34:05.293
What you got there?
What you...

34:05.294 --> 34:08.502
Show me your cards, man.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.712
You winning?

34:10.716 --> 34:13.207
- I love your haircut, man. I love..
- Sir? Sir.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.551
- It's like... It's slick.
- You're not allowed to touch the players.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.885
It's old-school slick.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.049
What do you mean
"touch the players"?

34:18.057 --> 34:19.388
We're friends.
We go way back.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.473
If I touch him, it's cool,

34:21.477 --> 34:23.138
- 'cause you love when I touch you, right?
- Sir?

34:23.145 --> 34:25.807
Sir. You're not allowed
to touch the players.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.145
- Everywhere I go...
- Sir.

34:27.149 --> 34:28.650
People just, you know,
like, start winning.

34:28.651 --> 34:29.982
You need to come with us.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.486
I need to come with you.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.602
I need to come with...
what?

34:32.613 --> 34:34.274
Oddjob, I just got here.
I'm not going anywhere.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.782
All right?
Just, like, settle down.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.650
Where are the ladies at,
anyway, man?

34:38.661 --> 34:39.867
No, not like old ladies.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.371
I'm talking about
real ladies, you know.

34:41.372 --> 34:43.738
It ain't no party
without no trim.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.175
Okay, that's enough.
You're leaving.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.555
Hey, don't touch me, man!

34:58.556 --> 35:00.547
I ain't done nothing, all right?
I just want my cellphone back.

35:00.558 --> 35:02.014
We don't have your phone, sir.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.723
You got my phone,
sneaky-G.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.218
I know you got my phone.
| just want it back.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.562
I ain't leaving here
until I get my phone back.

35:08.566 --> 35:10.477
Hey, what's up, Bobby?
What's the haps?

35:10.484 --> 35:12.600
What's going on?
It's been too long, mama.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.023
You're one crazy son of a bitch
or incredibly stupid.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.986
Yeah, well,
I'm a private citizen,

35:16.991 --> 35:18.231
and I got my rights, all right?

35:18.242 --> 35:19.448
I just want my phone, cupcake.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.827
Probably fell out of my pocket

35:20.828 --> 35:22.944
when you kicked the shit
out of me the other day!

35:22.955 --> 35:25.662
Hey, people, better beware
of the she-wolf!

35:25.666 --> 35:28.282
She'll crack your ribs.
Look at that, huh?

35:28.294 --> 35:29.750
She'll crack your ribs.

35:29.753 --> 35:34.087
Oh. I found my phone.
My bad.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.127
All right, smile, Bobby.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.626
Boom. Ooh, my boss at SPD
will love that one.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.877
He'll love that one.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.049
I got a gun, man!
What? What?

35:42.057 --> 35:44.093
Forgot it in my car.
I'm gonna go get it.

35:44.101 --> 35:45.682
I'll be right back, all right?

35:45.686 --> 35:49.144
I'll see myself out.
It's okay.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.725
Sayonara, Hiawatha.

36:35.903 --> 36:38.645
This is Detective Linden.
Leave a message.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.442
Damn it, Linden.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.617
This is Detective Linden. Leave a message.
- Come on, Linden.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.036
Come on.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.054
Holder. I'm in.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.764
What do you see?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.178
A hallway.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.926
All the rooms are bolted shut.

37:53.731 --> 37:55.096
Wait.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.315
I found the construction site.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.357
Large room.

38:06.368 --> 38:08.859
Been taken down to the studs.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.534
No obvious sign of blood.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.705
Why would Rosie come up here?

38:18.255 --> 38:20.086
She wasn't working that night.

38:20.090 --> 38:23.207
She didn't have to be
at the casino.

38:24.178 --> 38:27.011
It's dark, isolated.

38:40.444 --> 38:41.809
That's it.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.353
That's the sound
from the voicemail.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.273
Generator.

38:48.076 --> 38:51.113
The maid said they went up there
to smoke sometimes.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.531
Rosie didn't take a ferry
from her house at 11:45 pm.

38:55.542 --> 38:59.501
to come up here
and bust a lung.

39:00.631 --> 39:01.916
W-what about her backpack?

39:01.924 --> 39:04.290
It had clothes, a camera.

39:05.469 --> 39:07.926
Girl with dreams.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.805
Her teacher said
she wanted to see the world.

39:12.142 --> 39:16.681
Wanted something more
than what she had.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.855
So, why was she hanging out
in a dusty construction site

39:20.859 --> 39:24.772
in some crap casino
in the middle of the night?

39:34.623 --> 39:35.738
What's that?

39:35.749 --> 39:37.910
Sliding glass door
to the balcony.

39:37.918 --> 39:40.159
Same sound as the voicemail.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.377
She went out here.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.762
She came here
to look at the city.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.266
She was leaving
that night forever,

40:00.274 --> 40:06.861
she came to say goodbye.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.947
Linden?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.913
Linden, yo, you there?

40:24.840 --> 40:27.456
She was standing out here.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.083
And that's when she saw Ames.

40:30.429 --> 40:33.011
Rosie said on the voicemail...

40:33.015 --> 40:35.381
"I saw him again."

40:35.392 --> 40:38.384
He's standing in the room
with someone.

40:38.395 --> 40:41.603
Who was it... Nicole?

40:42.399 --> 40:46.517
She's willing to kill
to protect what's in this room.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.315
They're having some kind
of meeting.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.483
Rosie saw it,
and it got her killed.

40:54.912 --> 40:58.200
This is where it all started,
Holder.

40:58.582 --> 40:59.947
Linden,
you got to get out of there.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.119
It's been almost five minutes.

41:05.047 --> 41:07.288
She's terrified.
She calls Alexi.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.460
And then what?
They caught her?

41:09.468 --> 41:11.004
What happened after that?

41:11.011 --> 41:12.592
There was so much blood
on the backpack.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.632
What did they do to her?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.588
Linden, you got to go!

41:16.600 --> 41:18.966
How did they get her
to the car?

41:19.853 --> 41:22.094
There must have been
a struggle.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.720
Rosie must have fought them.

41:23.732 --> 41:26.439
There would have been blood
everywhere.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.137
Linden,
turn off your flashlight

41:58.141 --> 42:00.177
and get the hell out of there.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.017
- What are you doing?
- It's a key card.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.012
There was someone else
in here that night.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.400
Besides Ames, besides Nicole.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.899
Somebody from city hall.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.609
A key card.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.820
The mayor.

42:25.502 --> 42:27.993
Damn it, Linden,
turn off your flashlight!

42:28.005 --> 42:29.541
It's off.
