The Republic of Sarah...

00:02.961 --> 00:05.714
We have an opportunity
to build something great.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.800
In order to do that, we do need

00:08.842 --> 00:10.593
more voices in the room
than just mine.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.220
Greylock's new legislators are

(whoops)

00:18.518 --> 00:20.520
Why didn't you tell Sarah
you're getting married?
Well, I thought you would.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.605
You're her best friend.
Yeah, you're her brother.

00:22.647 --> 00:23.898
And it's your engagement, which,
you know, congratulations,

00:23.940 --> 00:25.400
by the way.
Maybe this time

00:25.442 --> 00:27.235
you'll actually
go through with it.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.279
I know why you had
to leave Greylock.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.280
Why did you leave me?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.740
I wish I could explain.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.700
But I can't.
You mean you won't.

No. We aren't that loud, are we?

I thought God

00:48.298 --> 00:49.466

Today's a big day.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.058
Today we start writing
our constitution.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.436
Together,
me as Greylock's leader,

01:01.478 --> 01:03.772
you as its congress,
we will establish the blueprint

01:03.813 --> 01:05.732
of our new country's government.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.276
A constitution is forever.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.278
But I know if we work
together, we can create

01:10.320 --> 01:11.988
something that all of
Greylock will be proud of.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.782
and we can show the world

What?

LIZ: Experienced leadership
is valuable.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.424
AJ: No term limits

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
a country ran by dinosaurs.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.177
Yeah, just like America is now.

dedicate one to the economy.

Police should be separate

Cops need oversight.

Yeah.
How many are there?

Hi, there. So, uh,
you're all from the same place?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.833
Radford, southwest corner
of the state.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.585
There's about 30 of us.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.086
Everyone's at that diner.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.797
But my little one forgot
his hoodie, of course.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.674
You're a long way from home.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.050
Well, it's not home anymore.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.635
Not after Diotyne
showed up a year ago.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.888
What was supposed
to happen to Greylock

02:59.929 --> 03:01.306
actually did happen in Radford.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.600
Except it was fracking
and not coltan.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.602
I remember reading about that.
They flattened the town.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.562
Yeah, and a few months ago,
a couple of us saw your story

03:07.604 --> 03:08.771
and we thought,

03:08.813 --> 03:10.982
"Why not move
to Greylock?"

03:11.024 --> 03:12.358
When we showed up
at the border this morning,

03:12.400 --> 03:13.443
we asked them
if we could immigrate.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.611
They looked a little confused

03:14.652 --> 03:16.571
and said
that they would call you.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.157
Greylock was always a welcoming
place when we were just a town.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.408
No reason we should
be any different

03:20.450 --> 03:21.659
now that we're a country.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.536
Thank you, Sarah.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.582
It doesn't matter
if they're nice.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.834
We can't have open
borders, Sarah.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.377
Because you don't
like immigrants?

03:31.419 --> 03:33.338
My mother was an
immigrant, Maya.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.839
I like immigrants just fine.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.799
But we don't have the space.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.551
Right now, it's
a few families,

03:38.593 --> 03:40.929
but what happens if a hundred
show up, or a thousand?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.223
Our constitution has
to set a precedent

03:43.264 --> 03:45.225
for Greylock
for the next 500 years.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.768
We can't let

03:46.809 --> 03:48.436
some incident from today
affect how we write it.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.271
DANNY:
We don't know who
these people are.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.523
Businesses run background
checks before they hire you.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.859
Shouldn't our country
at least do the same?

03:54.901 --> 03:57.111
New people means new energy
and new ideas for a community.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.613
Also means new problems.
Okay. I'm gonna

03:58.655 --> 04:00.114
pull our zoning maps
and show you

04:00.156 --> 04:02.116
that we have plenty of space
for new families.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.952
AJ can run background checks

04:03.993 --> 04:05.745
on our friends
from Pennsylvania,

04:05.787 --> 04:07.413
as well as anybody
else who shows up.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.375
Greylock was nearly wiped
off the map five months ago,

04:10.416 --> 04:12.627
and then it would've been us
who were the immigrants.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.796
We should be just as eager
to give out a second chance

04:14.837 --> 04:16.214
as we were to get one.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.092

04:27.767 --> 04:30.103

04:32.397 --> 04:33.940
Hi, Princess.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.739
What are you doing here?

04:41.781 --> 04:44.617
Can't a father come visit
his daughter?

04:51.749 --> 04:53.584
Where the hell have you been?

04:54.544 --> 04:56.587
I've been around.
Around?

04:56.629 --> 05:00.591
Do they have phones in around?
What about Wi-Fi?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.760
I should've called, I know.
I-I just...

05:02.802 --> 05:05.013
I haven't seen or heard
from you in 18 years.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.639
Why come back now?

05:06.681 --> 05:09.726
I saw Greylock on TV
with the drilling and Lydon.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.394
And then, there
you were--

05:11.436 --> 05:13.730
my little girl, all grown up.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.857
I'm not...
I'm not your little girl.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.442
Seeing you

05:17.483 --> 05:18.693
made me realize
I needed to make things right

05:18.735 --> 05:20.028
with you and your brother.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.030
That's why I'm here.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.281
I-I just thought
maybe we could talk.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.532
I don't want
to talk to you.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.492
Not now.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.536
Not ever.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.038
Sarah?

05:30.079 --> 05:32.832

05:35.335 --> 05:37.503
(bell dings)

05:37.545 --> 05:39.047
Do you have a
phone charger?

05:39.088 --> 05:40.673
My phone died during
the meeting this morning.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.216
Yeah. Counter, my backpack.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.218
All right, thanks.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.554
(overlapping chatter)

05:46.596 --> 05:48.222
Are these your photos?

05:48.264 --> 05:49.974
I, um...
Yeah.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.559
I didn't know
you were into photography.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.770
I'm not.
Dude, these are really good, Ty.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.563
I've never see Greylock look
like this before.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.857
I should honestly put these up.
Could you put those back?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.150
Please?

06:00.526 --> 06:03.029
Yeah.
Thanks.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.535
(indistinct chatter)

06:11.371 --> 06:13.331
It's two-for-one
donuts tonight.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.124
You want my extra?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.542
It's blueberry.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.211
It's my favorite. (sighs)

06:18.252 --> 06:20.505
Yeah, I know.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.050
Um, so, uh, how's-how's the...

06:24.092 --> 06:25.593
constitution thing?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.929
Turns out democracy is
a little harder than it looks.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.099
Since when
do you teach accounting?
I got this

06:31.140 --> 06:33.810
delinquency notice from a bank
that I don't even recognize

06:33.851 --> 06:35.937
that I guess has to do
with my student loans.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.730
Want me to take a look?
No, no, no. No.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.690
I've got plenty of time
to wade through the fine print,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.443
'cause Adam and Josh are
in Boston

06:42.485 --> 06:43.528
for a Cub Scout retreat,
so I...

06:43.569 --> 06:44.821
Corinne, I'm a lawyer.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.032
I eat fine print
for breakfast. I insist.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.284
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.702
Thank you, Danny.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.204
DANNY:
You're welcome.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.539
CORINNE:
This isn't too much?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.706
DANNY:
No.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.625
(laughter)

06:57.667 --> 07:00.461
Sorry I'm late, Ty.
The battery died.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.631
No problem.
It's been pretty light.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.467
Dead battery, huh?

07:06.509 --> 07:09.220
Yeah.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.222
You know
I know where you really were.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.224
And I know you know
I don't want to talk about it.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.643
You don't have to lie about
going to therapy, Grover.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.186
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.188
You know, it's-it's been
three sessions,

07:19.230 --> 07:20.982
and I've barely said a word.

07:21.023 --> 07:25.069
But I open my mouth,
and nothing...

07:25.111 --> 07:27.321
nothing comes out.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.240
Have you thought about
maybe finding somebody else?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.825
No way.
Edna's the only Black therapist

07:30.867 --> 07:32.660
for a hundred miles.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.871
Besides, she's not the problem.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.581
I am.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.626
Maybe therapy just isn't for me.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.504
It's hard, but
it's worth it.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.965
And you're worth it.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.845
SARAH:
And as far as I can tell,

07:50.887 --> 07:52.847
Greylock has more
than enough space

07:52.889 --> 07:55.349
for whatever or whoever
comes our way, so Liz can relax.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.809
I don't know

07:56.851 --> 07:58.519
what you're getting
so worked up about.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.189
Between me, you and Maya,
we have all the votes we need

08:01.230 --> 08:03.024
to outvote her
and your brother on immigration.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.026
No. We're trying
to build a real democracy.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.694
We can't just steamroll people
who disagree with us.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.446
We have to change their minds.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.656
These maps should help
answer Liz's concerns.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.117
Um, how is it going
on the background checks

08:13.159 --> 08:15.369
for Kayleigh and the rest
of our new arrivals?

08:15.411 --> 08:17.205
Mm. In progress.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.539
Okay, can you do me a favor

08:18.581 --> 08:20.917
and add Paul Preston Cooper
to your list?

08:20.958 --> 08:23.085
Why would I do that?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.338
Because he's here.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.341
Your father's in Greylock?

08:28.382 --> 08:30.218
Since this morning.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.969
Is he here for good?

08:32.011 --> 08:36.182
I don't know, and I don't care,
but, um, we told Liz and Danny

08:36.224 --> 08:38.100
we would look into anyone
who had the intention

08:38.142 --> 08:41.562
of staying in Greylock for
longer than a vacation, so...

08:42.605 --> 08:44.023
Okay. I'll
check into him.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.691
Yeah. Um, make it thorough.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.235
If you can find any reason

08:47.276 --> 08:49.904
to justify kicking him out
of Greylock, I'm all ears.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.031
You got it.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.706
(birds singing)

09:12.343 --> 09:14.428
(wind whistling)

09:28.276 --> 09:30.695
I missed you, Danny.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.286
You know, Danny, I...
I don't need all this.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.622
I can stay in a hotel
until I find a place.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.293
The hotel's full of immigrants
from Pennsylvania. Don't ask.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.462
This place is empty. Seems
like a waste not to use it.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.590
Just gonna turn the heat on.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.135
Oh.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.845
I remember buying that couch.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.639
Your old trunks are probably
still in the basement.

09:58.681 --> 10:02.143
Well, would have thought

10:02.184 --> 10:04.312
she'd gotten rid
of every trace of me.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.730
Please.
Never saw her do anything

10:05.771 --> 10:07.982
that required
putting down her drink.

10:08.024 --> 10:11.193
Yeah, caught her interview
on the news a few months back.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.321
Three DUIs?

10:13.362 --> 10:16.073
I had no idea her
drinking got so bad.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.200
"Bad" is an understatement.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.000
Hey, Dad?

10:27.126 --> 10:30.630
All this time,
where'd you go?

10:31.255 --> 10:34.925
Well... (exhales)
Wherever work sent me, you know?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.013
You didn't think to maybe...

10:39.055 --> 10:41.932
stop by once or twice?

10:41.974 --> 10:44.810
I-I... I-I wanted to, Danny.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.521
I just...
It was better that I didn't.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.690
Because of Mom.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.859
Because of me.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.361
I would've done
more harm than good.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.864
I-I just really wasn't
father material back then.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.200
But you are now?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.160
I'd like to be.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.208
♪ It's a cold day in... ♪

11:07.249 --> 11:10.336
Oh. Thank you, Groves.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.631
♪ And I'm wishing that... ♪

11:14.131 --> 11:16.592
What the hell is going on
with you and Danny?

11:16.634 --> 11:17.635
What?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.136
♪ It's a cold... ♪

11:19.178 --> 11:21.222
What do you mean?
I mean the smiles,

11:21.263 --> 11:24.141
the long stares,
the wistful eye contact.
(chuckles)

11:24.183 --> 11:26.811
It's like I'm watching
a-a teenage rom-com,

11:26.852 --> 11:29.105
the way you two are
looking at each other.
No. We're not...

11:29.146 --> 11:31.023
You're playing with fire.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.234
Grover...
Look,

11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
I understand
the power of first love.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.405
Okay? There's a connection
that doesn't fade

11:37.446 --> 11:39.490
no matter how
many years go by,

11:39.532 --> 11:42.243
and it's obvious you and Danny
still have that connection.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.161
And that's okay.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.080
You can't control how you feel.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.790
But you can control how you act.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.417
And right now,
you're acting

11:49.458 --> 11:51.544
like someone who's
looking for trouble.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.797
I'm not saying
this to be a dick.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.508
I'm saying this because
I am your friend.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.927
Stay away from Danny.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.388
That road only leads
to bad places.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.307
You know that.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.435
♪ It's a cold day in hell. ♪

12:07.476 --> 12:10.271
Danny! You let him
stay in Mom's house?

12:10.312 --> 12:12.064
It's his house, too.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.441
Oh, is it?

12:13.482 --> 12:15.317
Does he... Does he
pay the mortgage?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.486
What about the
property taxes?
What do you want me to do,

12:17.528 --> 12:19.071
send him a bill?
He needs a place to stay.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.116
How can you...
how can you treat him

12:22.158 --> 12:24.326
like dear old Dad

12:24.368 --> 12:26.162
after what he did?
Don't you want to know

12:26.203 --> 12:27.830
where he was?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.458
Don't you think it's weird
that he's suddenly back

12:30.499 --> 12:32.293
after all this time?
Of course I do.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.794
But, unlike you, I'm willing

12:33.836 --> 12:35.337
to actually let him answer
those questions

12:35.379 --> 12:36.964
instead of giving him
the silent treatment.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.799
You know what happens if
you ignore him, Sarah?

12:38.841 --> 12:41.469
Nothing. Just more silence.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.554
Look,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.474
he was our dad once. I'd like to
see if maybe he could be again.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.684
It took me years

12:48.726 --> 12:51.771
to climb out of the crater
that he left behind.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.822
He hurt me, too.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.824
Have dinner with him.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.035
What's the worst
that could happen?

13:06.076 --> 13:08.162
("Hang Up the Spurs"
by Cinemechanica playing)

13:20.216 --> 13:21.967
Hey.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.594
Somebody submitted two of my
photos to the Greylock art show.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.970
Tyler...
I told you

13:25.012 --> 13:26.514
I didn't want
anything to do with this.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.474
Hey, I know. I-It's just
with Bella being gone

13:28.516 --> 13:30.184
and me being so busy,
you've been

13:30.226 --> 13:32.353
kind of down lately.
Thought it might, I don't know,

13:32.394 --> 13:34.939
get you more hyped if people
actually saw your work.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.652
"Mr. Easterbrook, your work is
both trivial and pretentious.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.362
"The photos you captured
were amateurish

13:41.403 --> 13:43.030
and poorly composed.
We, the Greylock Arts Council,"

13:43.072 --> 13:45.074
on our highty,
hoity-toity horses,

13:45.115 --> 13:47.701
think that your work
is not good enough.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.204
Screw you.
Go back to where you came from.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.164
Hey, I was
just trying to help.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.541
I thought
you needed a boost.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.376
What I need
are friends I can trust.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.128
♪ What went wrong, here we go,
time to fight ♪

13:58.170 --> 14:00.589
♪ Now this dark horse
is riding. ♪

14:09.014 --> 14:11.225
You don't got to walk me home
from work, Grover.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.395
If a bear comes,
I'll just fight his ass.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.272
It's all good.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.399
My hotel is the
same direction.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.528
Besides, if you're
gonna fight a bear,

14:22.570 --> 14:24.321
I definitely want to watch.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.159
I guess your sour
mood has to do

14:29.201 --> 14:31.662
with your little throwdown
with Maya earlier.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.248
She had no right
to go behind my back like that.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.958
You're right.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.085
And if that were the only
reason why you were upset,

14:38.127 --> 14:40.546
I'd be on your side.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.757
That's not why you were mad,
right? Not entirely, anyway.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.093
You were mad at the results.
Yeah. Those judges

14:46.135 --> 14:47.761
tore me apart.
Look,

14:47.803 --> 14:49.179
the Greylock Council
for the Arts

14:49.221 --> 14:52.892
is old and white
and stuck in their ways.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.769
They look at Basquiat
and think that it's graffiti.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.313
Screw their art show.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.023
If you want to show your
photos, do it yourself.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.483
Don't worry what other people
think about your work.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.611
Focus on what you
think about it.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.948
Cool?

15:10.159 --> 15:12.786
So, I've been sending my
cash to the wrong place?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.496
For three months now.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.958
Which is why the new bank tried
to nail you with late fees.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.251
(sighs)

15:19.293 --> 15:21.295
Wait, "tried?"

15:21.337 --> 15:23.213
Yeah, I spouted
a bunch of legalese at them

15:23.255 --> 15:24.924
about failing to notify you

15:24.965 --> 15:26.634
of the loan transfer
and they backed off.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.094
Thank you so much, Danny.
This is so...

15:29.136 --> 15:31.680
This is so helpful.
You're welcome.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.098
You know, I assume
that you've been

15:33.140 --> 15:34.433
living out of a
vending machine,

15:34.475 --> 15:37.811
so I made you some cookies.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.480
(clears throat)

15:39.521 --> 15:40.898
Yeah.
Oh, my God. Please tell me

15:40.940 --> 15:42.441
this is the same recipe
from high school.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
Brown butter chocolate chip,
a little burnt?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.153
They're not burnt.
They're well-done.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.696
Mmm.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.032
You should bribe Sarah

15:50.074 --> 15:51.659
with these. I mean...
(chuckles)

15:51.700 --> 15:53.077
Might get her
to relax a little bit.
Um,

15:53.118 --> 15:56.538
her father left and
never looked back.

15:56.580 --> 15:57.915
She was six years old
when he left.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.249
And now he's trying
to worm his way

15:59.291 --> 16:00.292
back into her life.
She was too young

16:00.334 --> 16:01.919
to really know him or understand

16:01.961 --> 16:03.170
the whole story.
No, if anyone should
relax, it's him.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.548
Okay.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.219
And what's the whole story?

16:10.260 --> 16:13.138
My dad met my mom
almost 30 years ago

16:13.180 --> 16:15.599
when he was
on a State Department assignment

16:15.641 --> 16:16.850
in New Hampshire.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.268
When she got pregnant
with me,

16:18.310 --> 16:20.604
he settled down
because that's what people do,

16:20.646 --> 16:22.940
but having kids is different
from being a parent.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.943
My... My father wasn't built

16:25.985 --> 16:27.194
for fatherhood.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.862
Looking back, I realize

16:28.904 --> 16:30.614
he was miserable in Greylock.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.325
Guess I shouldn't have been
so surprised when he left.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.536
But now that
he is here,

16:35.577 --> 16:37.204
you're really just
gonna welcome him back,

16:37.246 --> 16:38.622
no questions asked?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.416
I have plenty of questions.

16:40.457 --> 16:42.001
But I know my dad. He loves us.
And you don't walk away

16:42.042 --> 16:44.503
from people you love
without a good reason.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.556
I should go.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.684

much for the help.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.225
So far, the only
information I have

17:40.267 --> 17:42.102
about the last 18 years
is that you were...

17:42.144 --> 17:44.271
around.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.566
It wasn't supposed to be
for that long.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.569
At first, it was just a week.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.404
Get my head on straight.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.364
And then...

17:54.406 --> 17:58.452
week became a month

17:58.494 --> 18:01.205
became a year.
Yeah, I know
how time works.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.498
We covered that in first grade.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.124
Not that you were here
to see it.

get me started

18:22.684 --> 18:24.645

18:24.686 --> 18:26.438
You mother was strong. She...

18:26.480 --> 18:28.190
She could roll with the punches.
Yeah.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.691
She could dole 'em out, too.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.486
What's that supposed to mean?

18:33.445 --> 18:34.988
You should ask Danny.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.990
You know, Sarah,
you-you think

18:37.032 --> 18:39.827
my leaving made me a bad father.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.372
But truth is
I was a bad father before that.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.082
Being a parent means
being selfless.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.333
I wasn't.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.793
I couldn't stop thinking

18:47.835 --> 18:49.586
about the opportunities
I was missing,

18:49.628 --> 18:52.422

18:55.717 --> 18:57.678
I'm saying I was an idiot.
So you've come back here

18:57.719 --> 18:59.680

Hi, Fenway.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.079
What's up with you?
You look like someone just died.
I was running

20:06.121 --> 20:07.289
background checks
on our new immigrants,

20:07.331 --> 20:08.957
and I found two things.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.417
First,

20:10.459 --> 20:11.835
Kayleigh's mother--
she's traveling with them--

20:11.877 --> 20:13.587
she was arrested
for civil disobedience

20:13.629 --> 20:15.589
at a Vietnam protest
in 1968.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.717
Okay, that's a...
that's a feature, not a bug.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.178
And second...

20:23.138 --> 20:25.474
It's your dad, Sarah.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.768
Paul Cooper is wanted

20:27.809 --> 20:29.561
by the U.S. government.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.531
You lied to me. You
only came to Greylock

20:41.573 --> 20:43.450
because you're wanted
by the U.S. government.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.994
And since we don't have
any official diplomatic ties

20:46.036 --> 20:49.456
to the U.S., that makes us
a non-extradition country,

20:49.498 --> 20:50.707
which means
they can't arrest you

20:50.749 --> 20:52.125
as long as you're here.
Princess,

20:52.167 --> 20:53.168
don't jump to conclusions.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.586
I'm not your princess

20:54.628 --> 20:56.672
or your safe haven

20:56.713 --> 20:58.465
or your way out.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.133
I didn't think
you could sink

21:00.175 --> 21:02.010
any lower than you already were,

21:02.052 --> 21:04.554
but congratulations.
You found a basement.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.350
You don't want to hear
what I did?

21:08.392 --> 21:10.227
Was it a hit-and-run?

21:10.269 --> 21:13.272
You were always really great
at fleeing from responsibility.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.525
I stole classified documents
from the State Department.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.235
Published them
online.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.862
The story was all over the news
a few months back.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.490
The Capeero-326 Leaks.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.158
I'm Capeero-326.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.676
My work with the Feds took me
all over the world.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.803
During that time,
I saw a lot of bad behavior

21:44.845 --> 21:46.179
at the State Department.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.598
Kickbacks, payoffs,
that kind of thing.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.269
But then one day last year,
the embassy in Kinshasa

21:52.311 --> 21:56.898
that was built
by U.S. contractors collapses.

21:56.940 --> 22:00.777
No earthquake, no bomb--
just poof, collapses.

22:00.819 --> 22:03.196
Kills 16 people,

22:03.238 --> 22:04.990
injures
another five dozen.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.076
So I started digging around,
and I find out

22:08.118 --> 22:10.370
there's this group
of officials at State

22:10.412 --> 22:13.206
that have been accepting bribes

22:13.248 --> 22:14.750
to look the other way

22:14.791 --> 22:17.878
while contractors use
shoddy construction materials.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.835
Why don't you tell me?

29:13.877 --> 29:15.295
What do you want to know?

29:15.336 --> 29:17.505
She'd get drunk
and then she'd get mean,

29:17.547 --> 29:19.466
and then she'd...

29:19.507 --> 29:20.842
get...

29:20.884 --> 29:22.260
You?

29:26.723 --> 29:29.058
Should've been there
to protect you.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.561
You're not the one who needs
to apologize for that, Dad.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.313
Yeah, I am, and...

29:33.354 --> 29:35.940
I will, even if
she never does.

29:35.982 --> 29:38.026
When you were
a teenager,

29:38.067 --> 29:39.652
was it all darkness?

29:39.694 --> 29:41.905
Was there any light in there?
Yeah,

29:41.946 --> 29:43.782
there were...
there were happy times,

29:43.823 --> 29:46.493
and, you know what, even...

29:46.534 --> 29:48.244
even on the worst days,

29:48.286 --> 29:52.749
I was never totally alone, so...

29:52.791 --> 29:55.752
♪ ♪

29:55.794 --> 29:58.755
SARAH:
Good morning, everyone.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.007
I'm really proud to announce

30:01.049 --> 30:04.928
that Greylock has ratified
its first constitution.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.638
The council and I are really...

30:06.679 --> 30:08.848
we're really proud
of the foundation we have laid

30:08.890 --> 30:10.850
for our country's future.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.394
But if the... if the process
of writing this document

30:13.436 --> 30:16.231
has taught me anything,
it's this:

30:16.272 --> 30:18.358
it's an imperfect process.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.859
People make mistakes.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.403
I know,
because I've made plenty,

30:22.445 --> 30:26.533
and I'm sure I will make
plenty more. We all will.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.868
So, before the council took
its final vote,

30:28.910 --> 30:32.205
we added one last clause
to our constitution

30:32.247 --> 30:34.541
to account for those mistakes,

30:34.582 --> 30:37.252
to account for the fact
that we're human.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.711
Every five years,

30:38.753 --> 30:41.548
our constitution...

30:41.589 --> 30:44.425
must be rewritten from scratch,

30:44.467 --> 30:49.097
so that we aren't chained
to the mistakes of our past

30:49.138 --> 30:52.100
or crushed
by the burden of perfection.

30:52.141 --> 30:57.397
As Greylock's people grow
and evolve...

30:57.438 --> 30:59.816
so will Greylock.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.831
How are you
feeling today?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.666
I know you're having
a hard time

31:16.708 --> 31:18.626
opening up, Grover.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.753
And that's okay.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.758
Why don't I do
a little bit of talking,

31:25.800 --> 31:28.928
and we'll see if that
inspires you to do the same?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.180
So...

31:31.222 --> 31:33.433
I'm Edna.

31:33.474 --> 31:37.061
I was born and raised
in Roxbury, Massachusetts.

31:37.103 --> 31:40.690
My mother was a seamstress,
my father was...

31:40.732 --> 31:41.941
an ass.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.110
(soft chuckle)

31:44.152 --> 31:46.237
And I've been a therapist
for 40 years.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.453
You're Grover Sims.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.873
You're 25 years old.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.335
You were raised
in Greylock, New Hampshire,

32:00.376 --> 32:03.922
and you're here
because...

32:03.963 --> 32:06.215
Uh...

32:07.175 --> 32:10.136
Because your wife died.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.727
It feels like there's an anvil
on your chest, doesn't it?

32:21.606 --> 32:23.608
When my Henry passed,

32:23.650 --> 32:26.110
I didn't leave the house
for a month.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.657
You're a widow?
(laughs)

32:30.698 --> 32:33.618
Twice. (sighs)

32:33.660 --> 32:35.912
Steven died in '97.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.580
Heart attack in his sleep.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.791
We should all be so lucky.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.336
And Henry went just last year.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.963
Pancreatic cancer.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.090
Here one day,
gone the next.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.885
When you lose...

32:50.927 --> 32:53.388
someone you love...

32:58.226 --> 33:00.478
...how... how do you, uh...?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.483
Get up in
the morning?
Yeah.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.193
It's not easy.

33:07.235 --> 33:11.280
You just have to remind yourself
that you're still breathing.

33:11.739 --> 33:15.201
And then you have to
give yourself permission

33:15.243 --> 33:17.328
to keep breathing.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.873
That last one's
the tricky part.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.834
I-I don't know how
it's been for you,

33:22.875 --> 33:25.503
but for me,

33:25.545 --> 33:27.964
it was never the grief
that got to me.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.508
It was always, uh...
The guilt.

33:34.762 --> 33:39.684
You, uh... you feel guilty
for still being here after...

33:39.726 --> 33:41.811
after they've gone.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.066
And guilty for...
for moving on.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.860
(sniffles)

33:48.901 --> 33:51.029
Even thinking about moving on.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.824
How long have you
felt that guilt?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.035
Right from the start.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.122
Right when
Patience first got sick.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.125
Patience.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.794
That's a lovely name.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.882
Oh.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.095
I remember when, um...
(sniffles)

34:16.137 --> 34:18.556
...when the oncologist came

34:18.598 --> 34:20.892
to give us the bad news...

34:23.269 --> 34:27.607
...just pleading for the
universe to give us, uh...

34:27.648 --> 34:29.817
more time.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.197
Or just give me the cancer
instead.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.451
Just make me sick, you know?

34:38.493 --> 34:40.828
(sniffles)

34:54.550 --> 34:56.177
(loud, overlapping chatter,
music playing)

34:56.219 --> 34:58.304
SARAH:
Can't believe
Tyler did all this.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.014
They're good, right?
I'm so proud.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.641
Oh, I know.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.400
MAYA:
It's your rejections
letter, huh?

35:11.442 --> 35:13.778
This whole thing
is so dope.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.863
Thanks.
How did you find
all of these people?

35:15.905 --> 35:18.991
Social media, mostly.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.493
Uh, I just invited anyone

35:20.535 --> 35:22.286
who got their art rejected
from the art show.

35:22.328 --> 35:23.830
Told them
they could show it here.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.918
(whooshing on TV)

35:28.960 --> 35:30.503
So, uh, what do you think?

35:30.545 --> 35:33.256
(growling)

35:33.297 --> 35:35.341
I think it's accurate.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.676
That we all become zombies?

35:36.717 --> 35:38.678
(growling)

35:38.719 --> 35:41.097
We all become
victims of our past.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.644
You made the right choice
voting "yes" on immigration,

35:46.686 --> 35:48.271
letting Dad stay.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.189
I didn't do it for him.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.358
You can't stay mad
at him forever, Sarah.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.404
You should give him some time
to earn your trust back.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.530
I will.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.948
Really?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.783
Yeah. He wants time,
he can have it.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.244
18 years.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.204
That's how long
I had to wait.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.873
Why shouldn't he?

36:06.914 --> 36:09.292
But until then, he can
stay the hell away from me.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.587
MAYA:
Listen, dude,

36:12.628 --> 36:14.881
I'm really sorry
about what I did.

36:14.922 --> 36:17.758
I should have never submitted
your work without asking.

36:20.094 --> 36:22.805
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.516
Why were you so nervous about
showing people your photos?

36:25.558 --> 36:28.936
I mean, you ran my campaign, you
organized our border protest.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.354
You're a total badass.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.647
I don't get what's so scary

36:31.689 --> 36:34.233
about showing a couple
of pictures.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.528
With the campaign
and with those... protests,

36:37.570 --> 36:38.905
you know,
I'm-I'm in the shadows.

36:38.946 --> 36:42.742
I'm, like, the guy
behind the guy.

36:42.783 --> 36:45.077
And with this, I just...

36:45.119 --> 36:48.247
You're the guy.
Mm-hmm.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.416
I feel like
everyone's just always...

36:50.458 --> 36:54.754
looking at me and judging me.

36:54.795 --> 36:56.589
And with the photos,
at least until now,

36:56.631 --> 36:58.591
I always had one thing
that I kept sacred.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.639
(wind whistling,
crowd chatter)

37:04.680 --> 37:06.098
Can I get some more?
Yeah.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.226
Thanks.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.939
GROVER:
Yeah, storm's getting
bad out there.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.691
Yeah? Weather reports say
it's gonna be a real doozy.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.236
They're comparing it
to the blizzard of '78.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.363
This place
looks great, Ty.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.989
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.658
Oh, sorry I'm late.
I had therapy,

37:23.699 --> 37:25.618
and that snow slowed
me down on the way back.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.203
It's not a problem.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.747
Um, as long as you can
keep everybody drinking.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.124
Got some cookies in the oven.
They might be burning.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.128
Right.
I saw that.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.964
You saw what?

37:38.005 --> 37:40.049
You being honest
about going to therapy.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.676
(scoffs)

37:41.717 --> 37:43.678
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, right?

37:43.719 --> 37:45.972
Right.

37:46.013 --> 37:48.474
You know, I, uh... I
never got to thank you

37:48.516 --> 37:50.643
for letting me
meet your dad.
Mm.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.980
And I'd like to come with you
next time you go and see him.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.065
I mean, somebody's got to help
him eat all those peppermints.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.025
(laughs)
Thanks, Grover.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.152
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.
