00:28.487 --> 00:30.197
- You're late
- Sorry Sir

00:30.197 --> 00:32.448
What's the threshold of the H2 molecule?

00:32.448 --> 00:34.117
14.7 electron volts.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.454
- 3rd brightest star in Orion?
- Viewed from where?

00:37.454 --> 00:40.290
- Earth
- Gamma Oriones or Bellatrix...

00:40.332 --> 00:42.876
If you prefer the original Arabic name.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.922
Not bad, now give me a hug Katie,
That’s an order

00:47.130 --> 00:49.174
I wasn't expecting a pop-quiz.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.886
Just wanted to make sure all those 'pips' haven't
made you forget you're a scientist first.

00:52.928 --> 00:58.100
How could they, I still have nightmares
about your fractal calculus final.

00:58.100 --> 01:02.271
There is still some work to be done, but once
the saw dust clears I think you'll be impressed.

01:04.147 --> 01:08.861
Voyager may not be as big as a Galaxy
Class ship, but she's quick and smart.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.447
- Like her Captain.
- 700,000 metric tons.

01:12.531 --> 01:16.368
15 Decks, Computer systems augmented
with bio-neural circuitry.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.496
Top cruising speed: Warp 9.975

01:19.538 --> 01:23.000
- Deck 1
- Of course I expect to get that up a notch or 2.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.377
Sounds like you already know your ship
pretty well.

01:25.377 --> 01:30.632
I've been buried in Voyager’s schematic for the
past 3 months, I can walk the corridors blindfolded.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.303
You might not want to shut your
eyes just yet.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.890
Captain on the bridge!

01:38.557 --> 01:40.559
As you were.

01:43.145 --> 01:47.858
- It's bigger than I expected
- Schematics never prepare you for the real thing.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.616
Try it on

02:03.790 --> 02:07.377
Don't get to comfortable, I have more
to show you.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.555
Your home away from home.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.309
- Coffee?
- Ahh, no thanks.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.395
Coffee. Black.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.734
- Any word from Tuvok?
- Not yet

02:30.734 --> 02:33.028
Shouldn't he have made contact by now?

02:33.028 --> 02:37.783
You know he's aboard Chakotay's ship, he's probably
decided not to risk exposure till he has to.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.536
Catching up with him in the badlands is going
to be tricky...

02:40.536 --> 02:43.664
Even in a ship as quick and smart
as Voyager.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.626
I've heard about a pilot who might make
the job easier.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.670
Who's that?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.964
Tom Paris.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.591
Admiral Paris's son!?

02:54.758 --> 02:58.595
- Correct me if I'm wrong, but he is serving a sentence...
- He's made some mistakes.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.142
But everybody deserves a 2nd chance.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.145
I look into it.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.277
If it's not too late I'd like to recalibrate
the navigational sensors.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.320
I think I can enhance the range.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.741
-Your coffee is not even cold and you're already making changes.
-Excuse us.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.619
I like a ship that knows where it's going.

03:22.661 --> 03:29.001
I assure you, Voyager has the best
sensors in the fleet...

05:29.496 --> 05:32.916
- The bridge is clear; there is no sign of the weapon.
- Continue scanning.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.085
Acknowledged.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.090
Briefing Room.

05:40.382 --> 05:45.220
Starfleet’s most up-to-date vessel and they still
can't design a comfortable place to hold a meeting.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.099
- What do you think Ensign?
- Captain?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.268
What's your opinion of this room?

05:52.895 --> 05:55.022
It is an efficient design.

05:55.105 --> 05:59.902
Ahh, there you have it, Admiral. It's
efficient. I must be wrong.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.279
Carry on.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.335
We added a new system. We’re thinking
of installing it throughout the fleet.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.879
The Emergency Medical Hologram
I'm up-to-date.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.964
Computer, activate EMH.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.550
Please state the nature of the
medical emergency.

06:23.592 --> 06:26.678
It's programmed with over 4 million
surgical procedures.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.766
Five Million and a medical knowledge of
over 3000 cultures.

06:30.766 --> 06:31.475
Impressive.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.229
Did you call me to "chit chat" or
is there an actual emergency?

06:35.312 --> 06:37.272
Its personality could use some work.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.192
I'm designed to practice medicine as
efficient as possible.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.444
Smalltalk only compromises my performance.

06:42.486 --> 06:46.240
Thank you Doctor.
Computer, deactivate the EMH.

06:47.699 --> 06:53.330
[Indistinctive Chattering]

07:01.547 --> 07:04.383
- Hello?
- Sir.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.554
Lt. Carrey, I don't think we've met.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.391
Jamieson, Anna. Service number 860790.

07:12.391 --> 07:19.022
I'm not security, I'm just trying to
get to know all new faces around here.

07:20.065 --> 07:25.529
- What are you working on?
- I'm attempting to realign the EPS manifolds.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.948
- Do you need a hand?
- No!

07:28.031 --> 07:31.493
- Well, maybe I’ll see you in the mess hall later.
- Unlikely.

07:31.994 --> 07:36.957
I’m not a member of Voyager's crew.
I'm on assignment here at Utopia Tenisa.

07:37.040 --> 07:43.380
Too bad. Well, next time I'm in the
Neighborhood, I’ll drop by and say hello.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.816
I wish Starfleet would give me
more than three weeks.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.277
With a little more time we could really
explore the badlands.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.863
You haven't changed a bit.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.950
Main Engineering.
Class 9 Warp Drive.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.703
Tri-Cyclic input manifold.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.375
You'll be the first to test
it in Deep Space.

08:33.889 --> 08:38.352
I've localized the temporal distortions.
Deck 4 Section 39.

09:04.962 --> 09:08.966
- I found the weapon.
- Begin the procedure.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.016
[Rapid Beeping]

09:19.768 --> 09:21.186
Problem?

09:22.521 --> 09:24.940
One of the EPS relays just went
offline.

09:25.023 --> 09:30.237
- Voyagers first malfunction.
- I'm sorry Captain; I tested those systems this morning.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.699
As you were Lieutenant, I've been looking
forward to getting my hands dirty.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.881
The weapon is out of phase, you've
sent me to the wrong time frame.

09:48.881 --> 09:53.468
At least we know where the weapon was
placed, now we have to determine when.

09:57.347 --> 10:00.058
This hatch is locked from the inside.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.145
This isn't a secure area. None
of these hatches should be sealed.

10:03.187 --> 10:07.274
- I'm reading some kind of chronotron flux.
- Chronotron?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.776
It's coming from inside this
Jeffries Tube.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.988
[Communicator Beeps]
Patterson to security, seal of deck 4.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.618
I've been detected, I must leave.

10:17.618 --> 10:21.872
There is too much interference from the weapon,
recalibrate your temporal transport beacon.

10:21.914 --> 10:25.667
- Understood.
- We can access section 39 through here.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.842
Scramble the locking mechanism,
before they get in.

10:33.884 --> 10:37.763
Hurry, they're approaching your coordinates
you'll need to reset the command controls.

10:37.763 --> 10:41.058
Stand by; we're trying to get you
out of there.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.119
It's time, pull her out.

11:01.119 --> 11:05.123
There is too much interference, if I transport
her now, we'll damage her bio-neural implants.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.918
If we don't, Captain Janeway is going to
find her and we contaminate the timeline.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.711
- Sir.
- Now!

11:12.673 --> 11:15.509
Temporal transport in progress.

11:29.648 --> 11:35.112
Question Admiral, what causes a
chronotron flux of.003?

11:36.238 --> 11:39.700
- I don't know.
- Neither do I.

11:39.908 --> 11:45.372
But whoever or whatever it was;
It’s gone now.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.587
Subject is approaching the
temporal threshold.

12:08.061 --> 12:13.317
I told you this was going to happen.
She's dead.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.791
- Any luck reviving her?
- No Sir.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.376
We'll have to recruit her again.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.255
Sir, a fourth jump she could suffer neural
damage, even temporal psychosis.

12:35.339 --> 12:38.008
Unless we repair the timeline
she's going to die.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.969
We give her another chance to
save her crew and herself.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.264
We go back and retrieve Seven of Nine
a microsecond before the explosion.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.767
That way no one notice she's gone.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.727
...Lieutenant.

12:49.853 --> 12:56.360
Raise shields.
Timeframe; Stardate 52861.274

12:56.401 --> 13:02.324
Delta Quadrant Coordinates;
87 theta by 271.

13:02.533 --> 13:06.203
- Target?
- USS Voyager

13:10.415 --> 13:19.383
Follow the light, to the left...
right... and up...

13:19.758 --> 13:22.636
and down.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.513
Hmmm

13:29.017 --> 13:33.230
- I ran a complete self-diagnostic.
- Uhuh

13:33.313 --> 13:35.941
At first I thought my ocular implant
were malfunctioning.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.236
However, after consulting the Starfleet
medical database...

13:39.361 --> 13:42.447
I realize it's a flaw in my human
physiology.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.742
- Specifically?
- I'm experiencing dizziness...

13:45.784 --> 13:50.164
double-vision, after considering all potentional
environmental and genetic factors...

13:50.164 --> 13:53.208
I've concluded that I'm suffering from
Albright Salzman Syndrome.

13:53.834 --> 13:59.089
A rare neurological condition, that hasn't
affected a single human being for over 2 centuries.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.799
Unlikely

14:01.008 --> 14:05.012
Human physiology is imperfect, susceptible
to a variety of disorders.

14:05.053 --> 14:10.893
True, but in this instance we can safely say
you’re suffering from a mild case of sensory aphasia.

14:10.934 --> 14:16.356
A minor disruption to your neuro receptors
neither rare, nor life threatening.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.568
Apparently I was in need of a
second opinion.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.530
That's the danger of self diagnosis.
Patients always assume the worst.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.074
This should clear it up.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.166
How do things look now?

14:34.458 --> 14:34.917
Normal.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.960
[Beeping]
Doctor, please report to sickbay.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.253
On my way.

14:38.378 --> 14:43.425
Next time your human physiology fails you,
don't consult the database, just call me.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.094
You are the database.

14:46.136 --> 14:49.556
With 2 legs and a splendid bedside manner.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.735
- A curious exercise.
- Yeah, Ping-Pong.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.822
You should try it, it's a great test
of hand-eye coordination.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.575
- I don't require testing.
- Yeah, so the Doc. tells me.

15:08.867 --> 15:12.579
A visual acuity index of 99.6

15:14.456 --> 15:16.500
You know, you'd be great at this game.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.794
Why don't you be my partner in
the doubles tournament tonight?

15:18.877 --> 15:22.756
Chapman was supposed to play, but he's come
down with a nasty case of space sickness.

15:22.798 --> 15:26.593
- I'm busy
- Ahh, to bad.

15:26.677 --> 15:30.264
Well, I guess I have to tell B'Elanna
that you felt you couldn't beat her.

15:30.347 --> 15:34.643
- You're attempting to appeal to my vanity.
- Is it working?

15:34.810 --> 15:36.728
I will consider your request.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.773
It's yes or no Seven, the tournament
is tonight.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.570
- Yes.
- Great.

15:44.570 --> 15:48.782
Meet me in the mess hall at 19:00 hours.
We’ll get into a little practice first.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.292
Captain, you don't look well.
Come in, please.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.003
- I'm sure it's nothing serious.
- Symptoms?

16:01.128 --> 16:03.380
Nausea, dizziness...

16:03.380 --> 16:07.342
Looks like a simple case of space sickness;
the 3rd one I treated today.

16:07.342 --> 16:10.012
That's odd, we haven't run
into any turbulence.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.389
It's possible the inertial dampers are
out of alignment.

16:12.556 --> 16:16.852
Even so, I've been on some pretty rough
rides. It never affected me like this.

16:16.977 --> 16:22.274
It's happens to everyone. 20mg of
inerproveline should restore your space legs.

16:22.316 --> 16:27.196
I'll check the dampers. Double check your bio
readings, see if there is another explanation.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.293
Point, server.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.880
- It's all in the wrist.
- Score?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.632
19- 18

16:56.141 --> 16:59.061
Ahh, say good night Harry.

17:03.482 --> 17:06.568
[Chuckles]
What do you call that shot?

17:07.486 --> 17:10.446
I'm reading temporal distortions.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.967
Report.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.970
The temporal distortions are fracturing
space-time throughout the ship.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.763
- Cause
- Unknown...

17:34.763 --> 17:37.391
They appear to be emanating
from Deck 4 Section 39.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.644
We already erected a force field
but they're not having any effect.

17:40.686 --> 17:43.856
If we can't find a way to stop them
they'll tear the ship apart.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.817
- How much time do we have?
- 2 Hours at most.

17:46.817 --> 17:51.363
Go to deck 4 and find out what we're dealing
with. Let's see if we can enhance the force fields.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.705
An injection a day, keeps space
sickness away.

17:59.746 --> 18:03.792
You try to be funny after treating
37 cases of nausea.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.544
- Janeway to sickbay.
- Go ahead.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.130
We found the source of our epidemic.
Temporal distortions.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.966
I was beginning to suspect some
kind of anomaly.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.844
I designed a treatment that seems to
be inhibiting the symptoms.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.304
- Keep me posted.
- Aye Captain.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.930
[Beeping]
Neelix to the Doctor.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.891
I've got a medical emergency
in the mess hall.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.851
Ensign Manis is violently ill.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.562
On my way. Take over here.

18:28.734 --> 18:31.153
Doctor, should I whip you up a
photonic snack?

18:31.278 --> 18:32.654
Where is the medical emergency?

18:32.654 --> 18:34.489
I hope you’re not returning to this
potroast?

18:34.698 --> 18:37.993
You called me a few minutes ago, you
said Ensign Manis was ill!?

18:37.993 --> 18:39.369
- I did?
- Yes.

18:39.369 --> 18:44.124
Ensign Manis is right over there, he came in
an hour ago, he looks perfectly normal to...

18:52.049 --> 18:55.219
- Acute space sickness
- Good thing you were here.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.346
I wouldn't have been, if you hadn't...

18:58.180 --> 19:00.682
- Temporal distortions.
- Doctor?

19:00.974 --> 19:03.519
This is all starting to make sense.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.607
In sickbay it's 1500 hours 43 minutes.

19:08.774 --> 19:12.986
But in the mess hall it's 15:36.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.365
- Seven minutes earlier.
- I did get a call from you.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.033
You just haven't made it yet.

19:21.829 --> 19:22.704
Coffee. Black.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.000
[Beeping]
Come in.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.172
Before you say anything, let me remind you
what happens to bearers of bad news.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.757
Don't kill the messenger.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.342
Go ahead. Fire.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.803
It looks like the space-time fractures
are growing stronger.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.972
We're detecting temporal paradoxes
throughout the ship.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.098
Paradoxes?

19:41.306 --> 19:46.186
Internal chronometers show it's 0600 on
Deck 9 and 0605 on Deck 13.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.606
Time is passing more quickly in some parts
of the ship and slowing down in others.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.735
Maybe that explains why this coffee
tastes like it's 3 days old.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.737
Same thing is been happening in the mess hall

19:55.779 --> 19:58.407
Food replicated less than an hour ago
is already spoiled.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.285
I've been working on a way to
enhance our containment fields

20:01.326 --> 20:03.453
to keep the fractures from spreading.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.789
I've get a team on it right away.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.625
In the meantime we should evacuate
the affected areas.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.295
- See to it.
- There is one other problem.

20:12.421 --> 20:17.634
[Echoing] Turbolifts are offline, so
we've been using the Jeffries tubes.

20:24.975 --> 20:25.893
Captain?

20:25.893 --> 20:28.020
There is a temporal distortion
intersecting this room.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.939
- It's expanding.
- Time to test your new containment fields.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.737
This is where they coming from.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.574
I still can't tell what's causing them.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.335
- What is it?
- A piece of technology.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.670
It's emitting temporal distortions.

20:54.213 --> 20:55.839
Why can't I see it?

20:56.256 --> 20:59.843
My ocular implant can detect
irregularities in space-time.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.096
Torres to bridge, we found the problem.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.225
There is some kind of device in
Junction beta 28.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.977
- Beam it off the ship.
- I can't get a lock.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.191
The distortions beginning to
de-molecularize the hull.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.861
Hull breach, Vector section 14.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.955
Captain, I'm picking up a strange
reading on Deck 4.

21:27.955 --> 21:29.122
What kind of reading?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.875
It's chronotron flux.003

21:31.875 --> 21:34.419
- More distortions?
- I don't think so.

21:38.799 --> 21:41.635
- Dry dock
- Ma'am?

21:41.635 --> 21:45.889
First time this readings was
5 years ago.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.934
Voyager was still in dry dock.
Same readings, same location.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.312
- What caused them?
- I never found out.

21:55.774 --> 21:59.486
- We're losing structural integrity.
- Multiple breaches, all decks.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.530
Emergency systems are failing.

22:01.530 --> 22:03.657
The distortions are ripping us apart.

22:03.991 --> 22:05.784
We have to abandon ship.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.330
All hands, this is the Captain.

22:10.622 --> 22:13.375
Proceed to the escape pods and
abandon ship.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.503
Repeat. Abandon ship.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.882
Program the pods for a heading
of 178 Mark 4.

22:19.923 --> 22:23.468
We'll rendezvous in orbit on an M class
planet of those coordinates.

22:23.802 --> 22:27.931
Repeat. All hands proceed to the
escape pods and abandon ship.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.607
- Identify yourselves.
- No time.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.806
- Welcome back
- Why have you brought me here?

23:10.807 --> 23:12.726
For some reason I always think
you remember.

23:12.768 --> 23:15.145
I'm Captain Braxton, this is
Lieutenant Duane.

23:15.187 --> 23:18.190
You're aboard the Federation
Time Ship Relativity.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.860
- I'm no longer in the 24th century.
- No.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.363
For you it's almost 500 years later.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.698
We brought you here to help us
solve a mystery.

23:26.698 --> 23:30.577
Someone, we don't know who, has
planted a weapon aboard Voyager.

23:30.702 --> 23:34.331
It's designed to fracture space-time
within a radius of 150 meters.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.918
- Why do you need me?
- Your ocular implant.

23:38.001 --> 23:41.255
It can detect disruptions in space-time
better than our sensors.

23:41.588 --> 23:45.133
You're more familiar with Voyager and
her crew, less likely to arouse suspicions.

23:48.303 --> 23:51.682
- So far you've been quite useful.
- So far?

23:51.682 --> 23:54.101
We've recruited you twice before
for this mission.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.728
Take a look.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.484
A force 3 temporal disruptor.

24:02.860 --> 24:05.320
Your previous attempts to
disable it were unsuccessful.

24:05.529 --> 24:09.074
We're trying to catch the saboteur
before he places the weapon on Voyager.

24:09.283 --> 24:12.161
- Do you have a suspect?
- Not yet.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.413
Do you know when the device was placed?

24:14.538 --> 24:19.126
Not precisely, but we narrowed the window
to a period 2 years before you joined the crew.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.336
When the ship was under attack.

24:21.545 --> 24:23.881
Species 329, the Kazon.

24:24.006 --> 24:27.467
Our database indicated that Voyager
were boarded twice during that period.

24:27.551 --> 24:32.431
Kazon are an inferior species, they don't
possess the technology to create such a weapon.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.351
We believe the saboteur infiltrated this
time frame, because Voyager's shields were down.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.521
It's the perfect opportunity to
evade detection.

24:40.731 --> 24:43.650
If I fail, you will recruit me
again?

24:43.734 --> 24:45.444
If necessary.

24:45.986 --> 24:48.822
This will be the 3rd time you are
going to be removed from your time frame.

24:48.864 --> 24:52.201
If we do it a forth, there could be
certain... side effects.

24:52.743 --> 24:53.869
Side effects?

24:53.994 --> 24:57.164
You might experience sensory aphesia.

24:57.331 --> 25:00.876
It can affect the cerebral cortex and
can lead to temporal psychosis.

25:01.084 --> 25:04.004
But in your case we're hoping
3rd time is the charm, eh?

25:05.172 --> 25:06.548
I'll do my best.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.009
- Bring her up to date on our protocols.
- Aye Sir.

25:09.343 --> 25:12.721
When you're finished, meet me in holo-matrix
One, I've prepared a simulation.

25:19.436 --> 25:21.688
See how much you've assimilated.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.942
- The dolly paradox.
- Also known as the melting clock effect.

25:24.983 --> 25:28.987
It refers to a temporal fissure, which
slows the time to a gradual hold.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.405
The pogo paradox.

25:30.489 --> 25:34.743
Causality loop in which interferes to prevent
an event actually triggers the same effect.

25:34.743 --> 25:38.080
Excellent, can you give me an example?

25:38.622 --> 25:43.210
The Borg once traveled back in time to stop
Zefram Cochrane from breaking the warp barrier.

25:43.210 --> 25:47.297
They succeeded, but that in turn led the
Starship Enterprise to intervene.

25:47.756 --> 25:50.843
They assisted Cochrane with the flight
the Borg were trying to prevent.

25:50.884 --> 25:51.969
Causal loop complete.

25:51.969 --> 25:55.597
So, in a way the Federation owes it's
existence to the Borg.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.683
You’re welcome.

25:58.392 --> 26:01.311
- The Seven of Nine paradox.
- I beg your pardon?

26:01.728 --> 26:05.274
How do we know, that my presents on
Voyager will not alter the timeline?

26:05.607 --> 26:07.609
You know you've asked me that
every time?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.152
What's been your response?

26:09.653 --> 26:11.989
Uncertainty is part of the equation.

26:12.364 --> 26:14.366
We don't know what's going to happen.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.785
I don't enjoy uncertainty.

26:16.827 --> 26:18.162
Neither do I.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.039
But I trust Captain Braxton’s instinct.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.209
Just as you trust Captain Janeway's.

26:24.918 --> 26:28.463
This is a simulation of Junction 49
on Voyagers 4th Deck.

26:28.797 --> 26:33.051
Thanks to you we've learned that the temporal
disruptor was and will be concealed here.

26:33.594 --> 26:36.263
I gave up trying to keep my tenses
straight years ago.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.348
How will I disarm it?

26:38.348 --> 26:40.851
You've already tried, unsuccessfully.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.978
The weapon is out of phase.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.689
We have to find the Saboteur, before
he plants it.

26:46.023 --> 26:49.818
This will detect any chronotron flux
other than your own.

26:50.319 --> 26:53.739
And I'm authorizing you to use
whatever force necessary.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.577
One more thing, watch out for
the Janeway Factor.

26:59.119 --> 27:01.246
I'm not familiar with that
protocol.

27:01.371 --> 27:07.044
Your Captain, has a neck for sticking her nose where it
doesn't belong especially when it comes to time travel.

27:07.336 --> 27:11.215
Captain Janeway is quite resourceful. Has it
occurred to you that she might be helpful?

27:11.340 --> 27:15.719
Helpful?! That woman has been responsible
for 3 mayor temporal incursions.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.638
No doubt, creating numerous paradoxes.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.057
And who do you think had to repair
the damage?

27:20.432 --> 27:20.891
Me.

27:21.642 --> 27:25.521
She's reckless, she has no regard for
the integrity of the timeline.

27:25.646 --> 27:29.274
I asked her to help once.
She refused.

27:29.608 --> 27:33.111
And I've ended up stranded in the late 20th
century. Have you ever been in that time frame?

27:33.445 --> 27:35.864
- No.
- Well I don't recommend it.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.201
After three decades with those post
industrial barbarians...

27:39.201 --> 27:42.996
I had to go through extensive rehabilitation
before I could return to duty.

27:43.372 --> 27:47.292
Avoid contact with Janeway.
That's an order.

27:48.669 --> 27:50.379
Yes Sir.

27:55.133 --> 27:58.095
This will occlude your Borg implants.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.764
- Ready?
- Yes.

28:00.848 --> 28:04.560
We have a saying in the line of our
work: There is no time like the past.

28:07.771 --> 28:11.358
- Raise shields
- Timeframe: Stardate 49123.5621, Delta Quadrant

28:11.358 --> 28:16.238
Spatial Coordinates 21 alpha prime by
936 Zeta.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.824
- Target
- USS Voyager

28:21.451 --> 28:23.120
All hands to battle stations.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.874
We're under attack. Repeat.
All hands to battle stations.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.483
Return fire.

28:54.735 --> 28:57.905
- Dropping spatial charges.
- Evasive maneuvers.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.327
Shields down to 20%.

29:03.452 --> 29:05.829
Another Kazon ship is approaching.

29:07.915 --> 29:10.167
Janeway to engineering, we need
warp engines.

29:10.167 --> 29:13.504
I can't give them to you, not until I’ve
repaired the containment generator.

29:13.504 --> 29:16.298
- Time?
- I need 10 minutes, at least.

29:17.841 --> 29:20.427
Captain, I'm picking up a strange reading
on Deck 4.

29:20.511 --> 29:21.887
What kind of reading.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.516
It's a chronotron flux.003

29:28.310 --> 29:31.563
- Any idea what's causing it?
- Not yet.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.944
It could be random interference
from Kazon weapons fire.

29:36.944 --> 29:41.198
I don't think so. I've seen these
reading before.

29:58.382 --> 30:02.636
- There is no sign of the weapon.
- Any uninvited guests?

30:03.345 --> 30:04.304
Not yet.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.560
The lead vessel has been disabled.
The others are regrouping.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.728
- B’Elanna, Status?
- Warp drive is online.

30:11.979 --> 30:16.191
But the containment field is still unstable
Warp 2 is the best I can give you.

30:16.191 --> 30:19.570
I'll take it... Engage.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.705
They're not pursuing.

30:30.205 --> 30:33.041
- Dry dock.
- Ma'am?

30:33.041 --> 30:37.171
First time I saw these readings was over
2 years ago, when Voyager was in the dry dock.

30:37.296 --> 30:40.424
- Same readings, same location.
- What caused them?

30:40.424 --> 30:43.552
I never found out, the signal vanished
before we could isolate it.

30:43.552 --> 30:46.638
Erect a level 10 force field around
that section.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.849
Is this really the time to be chasing
sensor ghosts?

30:48.849 --> 30:52.519
Something tells me this is more than a
coincidence, seal off Deck 4. Tuvok you're with me.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.822
They've erected force fields around my location,
I may have been detected.

31:03.989 --> 31:05.991
How shall I proceed?

31:07.701 --> 31:10.204
- Lieutenant respond.
- What's wrong?

31:10.412 --> 31:13.874
- The force fields are blocking our transmissions.
- Compensate!

31:15.459 --> 31:18.128
- Seven of Nine report.
- Relativity, are you there?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.130
It's no use Sir, she can't hear us.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.646
I don't believe, we've been introduced
Ensign.

31:36.063 --> 31:42.861
- Lower the force field.
- I stand corrected, we have met...

31:42.861 --> 31:45.572
Utopia Tenisa, Briefing room.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.783
You told me it was efficient.

31:47.783 --> 31:50.327
- Janeway
- You've mistaken me for someone else.

31:50.369 --> 31:54.498
Ohh I don't think so.
So here you are, 2 years later.

31:54.540 --> 31:57.417
On the other side of the Galaxy,
imagine that.

31:57.417 --> 32:00.170
You're preventing me from completing
a vital mission.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.673
Who are you and what are you
doing on my ship?

32:02.673 --> 32:04.758
- Don't say anything
- She can't hear you Sir.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.385
My designation is irrelevant.

32:06.426 --> 32:11.056
- But I assure you I have no hostile intension.
- Somehow I don't find that very comforting.

32:11.139 --> 32:13.934
- Are you working with the Kazon?
- No, I am not.

32:13.976 --> 32:18.272
I'm detecting bio-mechanical implants, they
have a Borg signature.

32:19.314 --> 32:22.317
Janeway to bridge, scan the vicinity
for Borg ships.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.902
- Did you say Borg?
- Do it!

32:23.902 --> 32:26.905
- You will find none.
- Then how did you get here?

32:27.114 --> 32:30.367
- I'm no longer Borg.
- Then who are you?

32:32.202 --> 32:34.705
- I can't answer your questions.
- Good.

32:34.788 --> 32:38.458
- Why not?
- It would be a violation of the temporal prime directive.

32:38.584 --> 32:41.837
- You're from another time?
- Yes.

32:41.837 --> 32:44.006
- No...
- Who sent you?

32:44.006 --> 32:46.967
I can't tell you that, I'd be risking
damage to the timeline.

32:47.009 --> 32:51.513
I' don't care if history itself comes unraveled, I
want to know why you're on my ship.

32:54.224 --> 32:57.561
- What's that?
- You must release me.

32:57.686 --> 33:01.857
- Why?
- Voyager is in great danger.

33:01.899 --> 33:04.943
- So we've noticed.
- Not from the Kazon.

33:04.985 --> 33:07.613
From an act of sabotage, I've been
sent here to stop it.

33:07.696 --> 33:12.409
The intruder has already boarded the ship.
Please, your lives depend on it.

33:12.451 --> 33:16.038
You're not going anywhere until you
tell me what's happening.

33:17.039 --> 33:21.752
My name is Seven of Nine, I am a member of your
crew, rather; I will be a member of your crew.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.172
I traveled back in time to prevent a disaster
that will destroy Voyager.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.424
- Get her out of there.
- I'm, trying.

33:28.884 --> 33:31.178
Let's see if I've got this straight.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.722
You're a Borg drone...

33:33.722 --> 33:37.559
Attempting to prevent a disaster that
will not occur for another 3 years.

33:37.643 --> 33:40.437
3 Years, 6 Months and 2 days.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.689
Does this make any sense to you?

33:42.814 --> 33:47.945
Like most time paradoxes it's implausible, but
not necessarily illogical.

33:48.070 --> 33:51.323
Captain, when you take me from the Borg...

33:51.365 --> 33:55.285
You're going to tell me, that part of being
Human is learning to trust.

33:55.786 --> 33:58.831
Trust me, now.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.799
Lower the force field.

34:13.971 --> 34:17.683
- Seven of Nine to Braxton
- Stay where you are, we're pulling you out

34:17.766 --> 34:22.813
That would be unwise, I'm pursuing the Saboteur
with Captain Janeway’s assistance.

34:29.570 --> 34:32.114
- Proceed.
- Yes Sir.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.201
Intruder is in junction 52 beta.

34:36.201 --> 34:38.036
- Take the Starboard hatch.
- Aye Captain.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.629
Captain Braxton.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.057
Lower the temporal disruptor.

35:00.350 --> 35:04.730
It's on, I'll activated, lower
your weapons.

35:09.526 --> 35:12.529
- Janeway
- Have we met?

35:12.613 --> 35:16.450
Too many time, but you wouldn't remember,
they haven't occurred yet.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.285
Seven of Nine, report.

35:18.744 --> 35:21.872
- I've located the Saboteur.
- Who is it?

35:22.122 --> 35:24.958
- It's you Captain Braxton.
- Me?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.127
More accurately, a future you.

35:27.336 --> 35:31.423
- Now let me complete our mission.
- Our mission?

35:31.590 --> 35:34.843
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen, very carefully.

35:35.594 --> 35:39.181
The circumstances of your life are going
to change in the next few years.

35:39.181 --> 35:43.310
You'll be sent into rehabilitation
again, forced to retire...

35:43.310 --> 35:45.646
And it's all because of Voyager.

35:45.646 --> 35:49.733
Captain, I think your future self is
suffering from temporal psychosis.

35:49.858 --> 35:52.653
Well of course I am, you
pedantic drone.

35:52.820 --> 35:56.156
The only way for me... for us to recover...

35:56.448 --> 36:01.370
is to obliterate Voyager from the timeline, that way none
of the events that caused this illness will have occurred.

36:01.453 --> 36:05.833
- What events?
- 30 Years of exile on 20th Century Earth.

36:06.333 --> 36:09.044
The temporal inversion in the Dekares Sector.

36:09.378 --> 36:12.506
Three violations that I had to repair.

36:12.589 --> 36:17.469
- Can you get a lock on him?
- Negative, he's activated the dispersal node.

36:17.594 --> 36:21.181
We should say, YOU activated the
dispersal node.

36:21.265 --> 36:24.977
Don't be absurd, I have no wish to
sabotage Voyager.

36:25.227 --> 36:26.562
Not yet.

36:27.145 --> 36:30.232
Remodulate the transporters, find a way
to cut through the interference.

36:33.277 --> 36:35.404
I gave you an order Lieutenant.

36:35.529 --> 36:39.616
I'm sorry Sir, I'm taking control
of this vessel.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.620
And I'm relieving you of duty for crimes
you are going to commit.

36:43.912 --> 36:45.581
I haven't done anything.

36:47.207 --> 36:50.294
Seven of Nine, apprehend Braxton.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.465
No.

36:59.386 --> 37:02.014
- Relativity, he's escaped.
- I'm tracking him.

37:02.472 --> 37:04.683
He's traveled to another timeframe.

37:05.017 --> 37:08.103
- 2 Years earlier
- Transport me to those coordinates.

37:08.353 --> 37:12.191
- That would be your 4th jump.
- I'm aware of the risks.

37:12.941 --> 37:14.818
Stand by.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.696
Thank you for your assistance.

37:39.593 --> 37:45.182
There's still some work to be done, but
once the saw dust clears I think you'll be impressed.

37:45.516 --> 37:48.936
Voyager may not be as big as a
Galaxy Class Ship but she is quick...

37:50.938 --> 37:52.147
Take cover.

37:56.902 --> 38:01.907
Security report to Deck 4 section 12.
Erect force fields around all access points.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.369
Is this part of the tour?

38:29.184 --> 38:30.060
I've lost him.

38:30.269 --> 38:32.729
He's still on Voyager, but
he's gone five years ahead.

38:35.232 --> 38:37.067
Initiate transport.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.710
Point, Server.

38:55.169 --> 38:58.338
- It's all in the wrist.
- Score?

38:58.422 --> 38:59.798
19- 18

39:02.676 --> 39:03.760
Who are you?

39:08.724 --> 39:10.976
Bridge, Intruder alert, Deck 2.

39:26.408 --> 39:29.286
- Explain.
- No time, you must apprehend him.

39:29.495 --> 39:32.748
- He's trying to destroy Voyager.
- Seven of Nine, status?

39:32.831 --> 39:38.462
- I'm incapacitated, it's sensory aphesia.
- Stand by, I'm pulling you out.

39:39.046 --> 39:42.090
Stop him, your future depends on it.

39:54.061 --> 39:58.482
- Braxton?
- I disabled his Tricorder, he's trapped there.

39:58.524 --> 40:03.362
Seven of Nine is pursuing him,
she's efficient, she will succeed.

40:03.654 --> 40:08.033
Let's hope so, because we ran out
of options.

40:17.876 --> 40:21.672
- You again!
- I don't believe we've met Ensign.

40:24.007 --> 40:27.761
No, I'm wrong. We have met.

40:28.637 --> 40:33.976
- Captain Braxton
- Not anymore, I've lost my rank thanks to you.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.896
Seven of Nine to Seven of Nine,
what's your status?

40:38.230 --> 40:42.484
- We've apprehended Braxton, how shall we proceed?
- Stand by.

40:54.913 --> 40:56.957
Long time no see.

41:02.337 --> 41:07.509
- You alright Seven?
- I believe we've just prevented Voyagers destruction.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.679
Would you care to explain how you...

41:26.320 --> 41:29.406
- The time ship Relativity.
- We need your help.

41:29.448 --> 41:34.495
This Seven of Nine stopped Braxton, but she's
created several temporal incursions along the way.

41:34.828 --> 41:41.293
She was engaged in a phaser fire at Utopia Tenisa, she was seen
by you and Lieutenant Tuvok 2 years before she joined you crew.

41:41.543 --> 41:47.174
And she interacted with her past self in front of
15 Crew members at a Ping Pong Tournament.

41:47.174 --> 41:50.594
Approximately 6 minutes ago, your timeframe
of course.

41:51.136 --> 41:54.515
- Of course
- Needless to say, we need to clean up the timeline.

41:54.556 --> 41:59.102
Someone must go back to the beginning and prevent
the chain events from occurring in the first place.

41:59.186 --> 42:02.189
I can't make another jump without
damaging myself.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.570
I get the feeling I'm about to be
drafted.

42:08.695 --> 42:13.992
In exchange for leniency, Captain Braxton informed us of
the precise moment he boarded Voyager, to plant the weapon.

42:13.992 --> 42:17.204
We'll be sending you to stop him.
Tell her.

42:17.204 --> 42:19.540
Deck 4 Section 38.

42:19.706 --> 42:23.710
I stumble over a wounded crewmember,
that will be your chance to capture me.

42:24.002 --> 42:27.005
Don't miss him, or we have to do this
all over again.

42:27.047 --> 42:33.053
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.
I'M going back in time to stop Braxton.

42:34.221 --> 42:37.766
- But you already have him.
- And there is a 3rd one in our brig.

42:37.975 --> 42:44.314
I arrested him earlier today, but don't worry, they
all will be reintegrated in time for the trial.

42:47.651 --> 42:52.865
- And Seven?
- I assure you when all this is over there will be just one Seven of Nine.

42:53.407 --> 42:56.410
Alright let's get started before my
headache gets any worse

43:05.210 --> 43:09.173
Captain, a Kazon torpedo just blew out the
containment generator.

43:09.173 --> 43:12.509
Do you want me to reroute power or take the
warp core offline?

43:12.551 --> 43:15.512
- Use your best judgment.
- I thought you were on your way to the bridge?

43:15.512 --> 43:18.307
I have to take care of something first,
now get moving Lieutenant.

43:31.528 --> 43:34.323
Send damage control teams to
Decks 9 through 14.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.701
Seal the breaches if you can,
I'll be on the bridge.

43:37.826 --> 43:39.953
- Keep me informed.
- Yes Ma'am.

43:56.470 --> 43:57.971
Come here often?

44:07.523 --> 44:11.443
Incursion factor.0036

44:11.902 --> 44:15.906
- Better than I expected
- Glad I could lend a hand.

44:17.449 --> 44:20.661
- When do we go home?
- You'll both be returned to your timeframe...

44:20.661 --> 44:23.330
you'll be reintegrated with the other
Seven of Nine.

44:23.330 --> 44:30.337
Since none of your time jumps, were to your foreseeable future,
only the past, I see no reasons to resequence your memory engrams.

44:31.213 --> 44:35.342
But remember the temporal prime directive,
discuss your experience with no one.

44:35.384 --> 44:36.844
Understood.

44:40.097 --> 44:43.851
Ohh Captain, Braxton was right about
one thing.

44:43.934 --> 44:46.562
Voyager shows up on our sensors far
too often.

44:47.145 --> 44:49.773
Try to avoid time travel.

44:51.316 --> 44:55.404
- See you in the 24th Century
- I'll look forward to it.

44:55.487 --> 44:58.657
- Or should I say backward.
- Don't get started.
