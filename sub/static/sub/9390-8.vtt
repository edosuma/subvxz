Hey, what are you doing
with my laptop?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.004
Going through
your stuff.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.172
Why were you getting
MapQuest directions

00:41.174 --> 00:42.173
to Abigail
Breslin's house?

00:42.175 --> 00:43.842
I just think she's
a one-of-a-kind spirit,

00:43.844 --> 00:45.310
and I don't want to see
her go down the wrong...

00:45.312 --> 00:47.545
What the hell are you doing
going through my personal stuff?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.114
You should really
clear your history.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.883
I noticed you Googled yourself,
you egomaniac.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.151
Whoa, whoa,
th-that wasn't me.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.786
Maybe Lois
got on there.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.056
She's fascinated by things
that are going in my life,
Oh. Oh, yeah.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.457
and... Fine, I
Googled myself, okay?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.226
You got me.
But check this out.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.128
I found a Web site
for a group called

01:03.130 --> 01:05.764
the Rhode Island Society
for Special Literary Excellence,

01:05.766 --> 01:09.100
and they happen to have chosen
to read and discuss my book,

01:09.102 --> 01:10.869
<i>Faster Than</i>
<i>the Speed of Love.</i>

01:10.871 --> 01:12.904
See? I knew it was
just a matter of time

01:12.906 --> 01:15.006
before somebody would
recognize my genius.

01:15.008 --> 01:16.174
Whoa, take it easy.

01:16.176 --> 01:17.976
You're getting a bigger
head than Chris Matthews.

01:17.978 --> 01:21.212
The economy's in the news today,
and Congress is considering

01:21.214 --> 01:22.347
a minimum wage increase.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.315
Live by satellite
to talk about it,

01:24.317 --> 01:25.917
Senator Harry Reid
in Washington.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.420
How about it, Senator Reid--
is this the right move

01:28.422 --> 01:30.021
during the worst recession
since the 1930s?

01:30.023 --> 01:32.590
Look, if we're gonna get
this economy back on track,

01:32.592 --> 01:34.092
we have to get more money
in the pockets of hardworking

01:34.094 --> 01:36.494
Republicans are saying
this increase is gonna, in fact,
Americans who are the backbone

01:36.496 --> 01:38.997
put more people out of work
and make it harder
of the American economy,

01:38.999 --> 01:41.132
for American employers
to compete
instead of lining the pockets

01:41.134 --> 01:43.601
in the global marketplace.
of the ultra-rich who are the
people who caused this collapse.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.937
Wouldn't it? Senator,
wouldn't it... Senator...
Chris, if-if I could just...

01:45.939 --> 01:48.940
Senator, let me finish.
Chris? If I could j...
Chris, if I...

01:48.942 --> 01:50.408
My forehead, my rules.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.643
Let's go to Los Angeles.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.279
Big actor, played the father
in <i>That 70's Show,</i>

01:54.281 --> 01:55.280
Kurtwood Smith.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.815
How's it going, Kurtwood?

01:56.817 --> 01:59.017
Good. Thanks for having me.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.520
Quagmire, it's so awesome
that you

02:02.522 --> 02:04.189
could come over
after work today.

02:04.191 --> 02:05.390
I know.
I'm so psyched.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.391
Hey, let's make
some Kool Aid!

02:06.393 --> 02:08.359
No, we got to wait
for Lois to do it.

02:08.361 --> 02:10.428
No, we don't-- I know
how to make Kool Aid.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.864
No, Quagmire!
We're not a'sposed to...

02:12.866 --> 02:13.398
(gasps)

02:13.400 --> 02:16.267
LOIS (calling):
I'm home, Peter!

02:16.269 --> 02:18.269
Oh, hi, Glenn...

02:18.271 --> 02:21.005
Peter, can you
help me with the...

02:21.007 --> 02:22.240
Oh, Peter Griffin!

02:22.242 --> 02:25.310
Peter, you come out here right
now and clean up this mess!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.479
No! You said I could
have two friends over,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.481
and I didn't--
Joe couldn't come!

02:29.483 --> 02:31.249
So I only had
one friend over,

02:31.251 --> 02:33.017
and it was just
me and Quagmire,

02:33.019 --> 02:35.120
and I said we could
make Kool Aid

02:35.122 --> 02:36.421
instead of the
other friend!

02:36.423 --> 02:38.056
You come out here right now!

02:38.058 --> 02:39.624
Bonnie's way
cooler than you!

02:39.626 --> 02:41.993
Joe has
computer games!

02:45.431 --> 02:47.098
Peter, it took me
a half hour

02:47.100 --> 02:48.733
to clean up
all that Kool Aid.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.935
I am sick as hell of you
constantly making a mess

02:50.937 --> 02:53.538
of this house and having
to clean up after you.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.105
So I hired a maid.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.174
What, are you nuts? We don't
have the money for that.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.143
Oh, really? And what about
the Peter Copter?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.345
Did we not have money
for the Peter Copter?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.614
Hey, did I say anything
when you bought that iron?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.750
Whatever. I want you
to meet Consuela.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.586
Consuela, this is
my husband, Peter,

03:08.588 --> 03:10.588
and these are
our children.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.857
Oh. Hello,
Mr. Peter.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.392
Hello,
Mr. Children.

03:14.394 --> 03:17.061
Consuela's gonna be
our new housekeeper.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.531
Why is she wearing makeup
like she's going out?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.233
Is this "going out" for them?

03:24.537 --> 03:27.338
Hey, where you going
all dressed up?

03:27.340 --> 03:28.373
Oh, nowhere important.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.074
Just this special dinner
in my honor.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.477
It's being thrown
by the Rhode Island Society

03:32.479 --> 03:34.913
for Special Literary Excellence.

03:35.447 --> 03:36.481
What's that?

03:36.483 --> 03:37.749
Nobody said
anything, Brian.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.552
Oh, I thought someone just
asked why they're honoring me.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.687
No. Nobody
asked that.
Oh, okay.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.322
I-It's no big deal--
it's actually,

03:44.324 --> 03:46.324
it's just you remember
the book I wrote,

03:46.326 --> 03:47.559
<i>Faster Than the</i>
<i>Speed of Love?</i>

03:47.561 --> 03:49.060
They loved the
book so much,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.130
they want to give me their
most prestigious award.

03:52.132 --> 03:52.697
Mmm.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.199
Look, this is a
really big deal.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.367
It'd be nice to get some
support around here!

03:56.369 --> 03:58.536
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian.
That's great news!

03:58.538 --> 04:01.773
(laughs): Yeah, what channel
will the awards ceremony be on?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.408
Oh, are they having
an awards ceremony

04:03.410 --> 04:05.643
for how well you did
the dishes last night?

04:05.645 --> 04:09.347
Ha! You got nothing
going on.

04:13.953 --> 04:14.552
Hi, Brian.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.588
I'm Kathy from
the book society.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.755
So glad you could come.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.157
Hi there.
Uh, you know,

04:19.159 --> 04:21.559
I wasn't sure I had
the right address.

04:21.561 --> 04:22.360
Pizza parlor, huh?

04:22.362 --> 04:24.362
(chuckles)
Yeah. The group
loves this place.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.031
Oh, hey, this is fine.
I-I like this place.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.633
It's... I'm a...

04:28.635 --> 04:31.236
I'm a pizza <i>dawg.</i>

04:32.171 --> 04:33.238
So, how long have
you been a member

04:33.240 --> 04:35.607
of the Rhode Island
Society for Special
Literary Excellence?

04:35.609 --> 04:38.443
Oh, no, I'm not a member;
I'm their chaperone.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.311
Chaperone?
Yeah, uh-huh.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.348
We're in that section
right over there.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.650
Hey! There he is!

04:45.652 --> 04:47.418
It's Brian Griffin!

04:47.420 --> 04:48.419
Damn it, Randy!

04:48.421 --> 04:51.089
You just spilled
my juice box!

04:54.727 --> 04:55.460
Oh.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.262
They absolutely
love your book.

04:57.264 --> 05:01.099
The simplistic writing style
is very graspable to them.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.736
Here's your award--
I made it all by myself.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.770
Thanks.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.473
Hey, Brian!
Smell my finger!

05:08.475 --> 05:11.509
I-I... I... I already can.

05:15.714 --> 05:19.384
Lois was right--
I'm not a writer, I'm a joke.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.253
I'm one big, fat,
ridiculous joke.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.223
Well, maybe you just didn't
try hard enough, Brian.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.458
You know what, father
from <i>Family Circus?</i>

05:27.460 --> 05:29.093
All you do is
judge other people.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.329
Every day in the funnies,
all you do is judge.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.398
Why don't you shut your
(bleep) mouth for once

05:33.400 --> 05:36.501
and go home and (bleep)
your wife in the face!

05:36.503 --> 05:37.602
You know what?

05:37.604 --> 05:42.173
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.980
(tires squealing)

05:58.090 --> 06:00.258
(sighs)
Almost home. Oh, my God!

06:00.260 --> 06:02.226
(tires screech, loud thump)

06:02.228 --> 06:05.763
Oh, please be okay,
please be okay, please be okay.

06:05.765 --> 06:06.764
Oh, thank God!

06:06.766 --> 06:09.500
Okay, you're gonna be okay,
you're gonna be o...

06:09.502 --> 06:11.135
Oh, my God!

06:11.137 --> 06:13.304
(tires squeal)

06:27.553 --> 06:28.820
Oh, my God, yes!

06:28.822 --> 06:30.655
Brian killed a dog!

06:30.657 --> 06:32.123
This is fantastic!

06:32.125 --> 06:35.193
Oh, Mr. Swanson
is sleep-dragging again.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.627
I'm flying.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.130
I'm flying!

06:45.104 --> 06:46.237
I clean in here?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.305
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

06:47.307 --> 06:51.075
I'm just reading the funnies,
so keep it down.

You callin' about my dog?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.691
He's all I got,
'cause I'm a young street tough,

08:13.693 --> 08:15.660
and my parents
ain't so good to me.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.595
So, have you heard anything?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.765
Did anybody see anything?
Or anybody?

08:20.767 --> 08:22.467

09:10.250 --> 09:15.253
And this one I call
"Alive Dog Burying Dead Dog."

09:15.255 --> 09:16.454
This is a photograph!

09:16.456 --> 09:17.955
Oh, is it?
Wait a minute.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.424
You saw the
whole thing?
Yes, indeed.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.592
(laughing):
Oh, boy.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.860
Have I been
having some fun

09:22.862 --> 09:24.562
at your expense,
old man!

09:24.564 --> 09:25.696
How could you
do that to me?

09:25.698 --> 09:28.833
Do you have any idea how
upset I am about all this?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.668
I killed one of my
own kind, Stewie.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.937
How would you feel if
you killed a baby?

09:32.939 --> 09:33.838
Well, I've killed seven,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.606
but the point is,
you might feel better

09:35.608 --> 09:37.742
if you just confess
to what you've done.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.512
(sighs)
Maybe you're right.

09:45.450 --> 09:49.520
Everyone, I have something
very important to tell you.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.023
Is this about Meg's
cervical cancer?

09:52.025 --> 09:52.623
What?!

09:52.625 --> 09:55.026
(laughing):
You always
fall for that!

09:55.028 --> 09:57.662
You can't always
fall for that!

09:57.664 --> 09:59.497
You-you just can't!

09:59.499 --> 10:00.898
Go ahead, Brian.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.700
(knock at door)

10:03.802 --> 10:06.537
Hi, Joe.
Thanks for coming.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.706
Okay, now
that Joe's here,

10:08.708 --> 10:11.842
I can say this
in front of all of you.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.978
Everyone...

10:13.980 --> 10:15.546
I am a criminal.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.415
A few nights ago,
I committed a murder.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.818
Then I buried the body
and even went out of my way

10:20.820 --> 10:22.520
to cover up the evidence.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.387
Oh, my God!

10:23.389 --> 10:25.590
These are very serious
charges, Brian.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.692
I know, and that's
why I'm prepared

10:27.694 --> 10:28.926
for you to arrest me

10:28.928 --> 10:30.928
and take me to jail
where I belong.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.264
I just couldn't take
the stress anymore.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.232
I had to come clean.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.400
I mean, the truth is,
I didn't even stop

10:36.402 --> 10:37.635
to find out if
he had an owner.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.303
I just completely...
Wait, wait, owner?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.606
What are you
talking about?
I just told you.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.609
I hit and killed a
dog with my car!

10:45.877 --> 10:47.878
(others laughing)

10:47.880 --> 10:48.746
What?

10:48.748 --> 10:51.015
(laughing):
Brian...
it's a dog!

10:51.017 --> 10:52.483
That's not
a crime!

10:52.485 --> 10:53.884
What do you mean?

10:53.886 --> 10:54.852
Well... I mean,

10:54.854 --> 10:56.988
it's not like
you killed a <i>person.</i>

10:56.990 --> 10:59.957
Or-or even ran over
somebody's mailbox.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.959
Killing a dog
is not a crime?

11:01.961 --> 11:04.829
(laughing):
Of course not!

11:04.831 --> 11:06.197
Yeah, especially
for you.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.798
An animal killing
another animal?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.001
That happens
all the time.

11:10.769 --> 11:14.572
Hey, sweet ass,
last night was fantastic.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.608
Hello? Where'd you go?

11:20.279 --> 11:21.946
(gasps)

11:23.815 --> 11:25.082
(screeches)

11:25.084 --> 11:29.020
Oh. Well, then I guess I
worried for nothing.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.356
Yeah, nobody cares
if a dog gets killed.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.593
I could do it, Brian!
I could do it right now!

11:35.595 --> 11:36.594
Nobody would say a thing!

11:36.596 --> 11:38.829
I could blow your brains out
and they'd throw me a parade!

11:38.831 --> 11:41.465
What?
I'm just screwing
around, Brian.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.034
Nobody cares.

11:49.908 --> 11:51.509
Peter, what are you doing?

11:51.511 --> 11:52.643
She's still here, Lois.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.812
Wasn't she supposed to leave
like two hours ago?

11:54.814 --> 11:57.615
I thought so. Go ask
her what she's doing.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.051
I'm not asking her.
You go ask her.

12:01.553 --> 12:02.586
Uh, Consuela?

12:02.588 --> 12:04.855
I thought you
finished cleaning hours ago.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.824
Yeah, what are
you still doing here?

12:06.826 --> 12:08.426
I wait for
rain to stop.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.194
It's time for
you to go home.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.396
Is too much rain.
I stay.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.165
But it's gonna
rain all night.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.700
I sleep here.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.501
Uh, I don't know
about that.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.370
I sleep here.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.807
Can I get some
covers over here?

12:22.809 --> 12:27.745
No. No. You fat
keep you warm.

12:34.152 --> 12:36.620
No, no...

12:44.563 --> 12:47.698
You know, Brian, I love it
here at the ice cream shop.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.567
In fact, this is gonna
be my happy place.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.736
If I ever get molested or
raped, this is the place

12:51.738 --> 12:54.004
I'm gonna think of to make
everything all right.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.206
That's great, Stewie.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.974
Hey, what's up your fanny?
Nothing. I'm just...

12:56.976 --> 12:59.176
I'm a little bummed out
from the other day.

12:59.178 --> 13:02.213
I just can't believe
our society actually values

13:02.215 --> 13:05.649
the life of a dog less than that
of a human. It's infuriating.

13:05.651 --> 13:07.651
That is infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark

13:07.653 --> 13:09.987
at a tree and chew on
your balls for an hour.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.590
You know, that's the problem.
That's usually the way I'd

13:12.592 --> 13:14.592
handle this kind of thing,
but not this time.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.860
I mean, look at
that dog over there.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.762
You think he wants to be tied
to that chair,

13:17.764 --> 13:20.498
waiting in the hot sun while his
owner gets ice cream?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
Hell, no! I am gonna
make people see

13:22.502 --> 13:26.837
that an animal's life is just
as important as a human's!

13:27.706 --> 13:31.742
Go, fellow canine,
be free and enjoy life!

13:32.477 --> 13:34.178
(screams) Oh, my God!
Help! Help!

13:34.180 --> 13:37.014
It's killing my dog!

13:37.016 --> 13:39.750
(screams)
He's got my neck!

13:39.752 --> 13:44.555
(groaning)

13:44.557 --> 13:45.956
(gunshots)

13:45.958 --> 13:49.894
(sobbing): Oh, my God!
My dog is dead!

13:49.896 --> 13:53.697
Maybe that's why
he was tied up.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.371
Meg, will you take one of these
and pass it down, please?

14:00.373 --> 14:03.107
What's this?
I'm starting a
new advocacy group.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.276
The Quahog Animal
Equal Rights League.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.844
Our first meeting
is tomorrow night,

14:06.846 --> 14:08.813
and I'd really
appreciate it if you guys

14:08.815 --> 14:09.947
would come and
show your support.

14:09.949 --> 14:13.050
Well, of course we will, Brian.
We'd be happy to come.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.718
Terrific. See, I thought I'd
start locally,

14:14.720 --> 14:17.254
and then maybe try to merge
with one of the larger groups.

14:17.256 --> 14:21.292
Oh, that's a great idea, Brian.
Maybe you could join PETA.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.293
Join me for what?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.028
No, PETA.
The organization.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.262
What organization?

14:25.264 --> 14:26.464
PETA.
What?

14:26.466 --> 14:27.731
PETA is an acronym, Peter.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.033
No, I'm not!
I'm Catholic!

14:29.035 --> 14:30.267
Are we really
doing this?

14:30.269 --> 14:33.704
No, Peter, I'm just saying,
maybe if this meeting goes well,

14:33.706 --> 14:35.272
Brian could be part
of a PETA rally.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.974
Somebody's having
a rally for me now?

14:36.976 --> 14:39.243
No, for PETA.
That's me! I'm Peter!

14:39.245 --> 14:42.379
I'm not talking about you,
Peter! I'm talking about PETA!

14:42.381 --> 14:45.382
Somebody better have something
to say to me pretty damn soon,

14:45.384 --> 14:47.751
or I'm gonna have something
to say to them!

14:47.753 --> 14:49.286
I am very busy!

14:49.288 --> 14:51.055
I think Betty White
is in PETA.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.958
That doesn't even
make any sense!

14:56.728 --> 14:59.163
(knocking at door)

15:00.298 --> 15:02.032
Oh. Hi, Consuela.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.000
Hello, Mr. Peter.

15:03.002 --> 15:07.938
No school today, so I
bring my nephew, Mikey.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.207
You want to buy
light-up yo-yo?

15:10.209 --> 15:12.843
Well... kinda.

15:13.745 --> 15:16.146
That's it. Peter, we have
got to get rid of her.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.315
I couldn't agree more.
Just let me see if Mikey sells

15:18.317 --> 15:22.553
those things with batteries
or what the situation is there.

15:23.255 --> 15:27.024
Consuela, I'm sorry,
but this is not working out.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.993
We're asking you to go.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.128
No, I stay. I clean.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.130
You don't understand.
You're fired.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.365
No, I keep job.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.035
Here. Here's $40
if you leave right now.

15:38.037 --> 15:39.770
No. I stay.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.873
God, she's more stubborn
than you are.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.676
Daddy, I want a turn
on the swing set.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.210
No.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.178
But you've gone
for two turns.

15:48.180 --> 15:48.946
Get lost.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.781
It looks like fun,
and I want to do it.

15:50.783 --> 15:55.219
No, I'm doing it.
I'm gonna do a big jump-off.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.288
Aah! Get Mom!

15:57.290 --> 16:00.057
Mom! Mom! Mom!

16:02.427 --> 16:05.029
Good evening, everyone.
I want to thank you all

16:05.031 --> 16:07.131
for joining me at this
very important event.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.100
Animals are treated
as second-class citizens

16:10.102 --> 16:11.802
everywhere throughout
this nation.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.205
We kill them for food,
we humiliate them as pets,

16:15.207 --> 16:18.242
and we use them for
medical and cosmetic research.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.710

Now, underneath each one of your

17:20.873 --> 17:25.009
with a simple list of animal
rights do's and don'ts.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.177
Wait a minute, I'm not allowed
to have steak?

17:27.179 --> 17:30.014
Well, no. Steak is made
by killing cattle.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.181
No medical research?

17:31.183 --> 17:34.018
But how are we supposed
to find cures for disease?

17:34.020 --> 17:36.353
Well, there are many more
promising research methods

17:36.355 --> 17:38.555
for curing disease
than animal testing.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.224
Name one.
I want a hamburger.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.026
I have a sudden craving
for quail.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.293
No, no,
you're missing the point.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.562
We've got to change our way
of thinking.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.232
Animals are miracles
of nature, just like humans,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.334
but our society
hasn't figured that out.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.003
Do you know that
in some Asian countries

17:53.005 --> 17:54.938
they actually cook and eat dogs?

17:54.940 --> 17:57.241
What?! Oh, no.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.143
Are they... are they good?

17:59.145 --> 18:00.477
Yeah, I wonder
what they taste like.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.781
I would try it...
I mean, if everybody else was.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.015
I'm adventurous.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.317
You know what, you know what?
This is driving me crazy.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.886
I want to eat a dog now.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.487
I say we eat that one!

18:10.489 --> 18:12.656
What?!
Get him!

18:17.262 --> 18:21.565
(sniffling and sobbing)

18:22.801 --> 18:24.068
What the hell is this?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.236
Nobody gives a damn
about animals!

18:26.238 --> 18:30.040
I just never realized how
little meaning my life had!

18:30.042 --> 18:33.143
Stewie, my life
isn't worth anything!

18:33.145 --> 18:36.447
Oh, come on... Hey...

18:36.449 --> 18:39.216

18:44.055 --> 18:48.025

Chardonnay! He's tricking you!

18:57.369 --> 18:59.236
Get out of there!

19:00.705 --> 19:02.206
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Abogados!</i>

19:02.208 --> 19:05.109
<i>Cinco cinco cinco,</i>
<i>cinco cinco cinco cinco!</i>

19:05.111 --> 19:06.710
<i>¿Accidente? Abogados!</i>

19:06.712 --> 19:10.614
<i>Cinco cinco cinco,</i>
<i>cinco cinco cinco cinco!</i>

19:10.616 --> 19:14.485
Uh, Consuela, does this rag
smell like chloroform?

19:14.487 --> 19:18.188
No, no, is no...

19:19.924 --> 19:21.825
(doorbell chimes)

19:23.161 --> 19:26.497
I need more Lemon Pledge.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.198
Okay.

19:30.935 --> 19:32.269
(knocking)

19:33.104 --> 19:34.838
Is this the Griffin household?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.506
Yes.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.908
There was a fire
at Quahog Liquor last night.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.109
No people were killed,

19:39.111 --> 19:41.278
but the burned body of a dog
was found inside.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.947
The tag on the collar
says he lived here.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.282
I'm sorry.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.185
Oh, my God! Brian!

19:48.187 --> 19:50.420
What the hell happened?

19:50.422 --> 19:52.523
Brian's dead!

19:54.325 --> 19:55.125
Hey, come here.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.861
Got something
you'll want to see.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.135
I can't believe
Brian's dead.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.372
My best friend
in the whole world...

20:08.374 --> 20:10.707
and he's gone.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.376
(sobbing)

20:12.378 --> 20:16.246
You know, Peter, I think
he was also my best friend.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.448
He was the smartest
person I knew.

20:18.450 --> 20:22.252
Nothing will ever
be the same again.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.192
Wow. I guess my life
does have meaning.

20:28.194 --> 20:32.296
I never realized how important
I was to this family.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.398
Wait a second.
Just to prove a point to me,

20:34.400 --> 20:38.001
you burned down a liquor store
and murdered a dog?!

20:38.003 --> 20:39.603
Well, a stray.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.370
Thank you.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.840
Well, I guess we should tell
them the truth now.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.007
Well, hold...
hold on a sec.

20:44.009 --> 20:48.078
We could... probably let 'em go
for just a few more minutes.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.581
(sobbing)

20:54.586 --> 20:57.888
Hi. We here at <i>Family Guy</i>
<i>want you to know that we respect</i>

20:57.890 --> 21:00.324
all living beings and assure you
that no animals

21:00.326 --> 21:02.426
were harmed in the making
of this episode.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.661
But we're about to hurt
the feelings

21:04.663 --> 21:05.929
of this Italian opera singer

21:05.931 --> 21:08.532
by prematurely dropping
the curtain on his performance.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.702
♪ Figaro li, Figaro la,
Figaro mi, Figaro... ♪

21:11.704 --> 21:14.037
Aw...
