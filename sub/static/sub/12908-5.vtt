Now is the time for camping

23:26.613 --> 23:28.488
and road trips and stoned sex.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.743
Val, you spend your whole life

23:32.744 --> 23:34.494
taking care of other people,

23:34.495 --> 23:38.916
and I am sure that that feels
familiar and comfortable,

23:38.917 --> 23:42.629
but... no.

23:46.090 --> 23:49.009
Okay.

23:53.681 --> 23:57.392
Who's the god of relationships?

23:57.393 --> 23:59.645
Cupid?

23:59.646 --> 24:02.314
Sure.

24:02.315 --> 24:06.568
To Cupid, god of relationships,

24:06.569 --> 24:10.072
accept our humble tribute.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.574
May the twisted spokes

24:12.575 --> 24:15.327
and broken handlebars

24:15.328 --> 24:17.996
satisfy your thirst for blood.

24:17.997 --> 24:19.665
- Thirst for blood?
- Uh-huh.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.583
- Cupid loves blood.
- Okay, then.

24:21.584 --> 24:25.963
Also heartache, shame, agony...

24:25.964 --> 24:28.757
Why would Cupid like that stuff?

24:28.758 --> 24:30.550
'Cause if those things didn't exist,

24:30.551 --> 24:33.303
relationships would be easy
and he'd be out of a job.

24:37.475 --> 24:40.018
Are you ready?

24:40.019 --> 24:42.062
One,

24:42.063 --> 24:44.147
