00:33.832 --> 00:35.701

- Ew.

It's not a teardown.

03:40.486 --> 03:43.188
- Well, we lost one person
because of the telephone pole.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.356
- Right.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.591
- I was trying
everything in my power.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.793
I was, like, trying to hide
it, saying that, you know,

03:47.826 --> 03:49.728
it's historic, it's beautiful,
it's all those things.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.331
I don't have all the answers,
Dolph, but you gotta trust me.

05:37.803 --> 05:40.473

You've been married.

05:50.449 --> 05:52.584
You know, enjoy yourself.
And here we are with--

05:52.619 --> 05:55.422
You sold your house, and
I'm about to sell my house.

05:55.454 --> 05:56.755

05:56.790 --> 05:58.792
that you're actually

05:58.824 --> 06:00.492

it. I'm ready to sell.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.728

06:01.761 --> 06:02.928

been a long time.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.630
I'm ready to do it.

06:04.663 --> 06:06.766
I've bought another
place, and it's time to move.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.670
<i>- Mapleton has

06:10.704 --> 06:12.738

Christmastime there.</i>

06:15.641 --> 06:17.543
<i>I mean, we've had
birthdays there.</i>

06:17.576 --> 06:19.846
Just a lot of sweet memories.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.882
<i>She's deciding to sell
because she got a divorce,</i>

06:22.915 --> 06:25.752
and she wants something
smaller for her and her two girls

06:25.785 --> 06:27.487
<i>that's just more manageable,</i>

06:27.519 --> 06:29.456
which, by the way, I
completely relate to.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.358
- During the pandemic,
it's been tough,

06:31.391 --> 06:33.589
and the markets
got stale for a bit,

06:33.590 --> 06:34.827
and I think it was
a good idea to...

06:34.860 --> 06:36.129
- Yeah.
- Take it off.

06:36.161 --> 06:38.697
- Agree. It's been
about seven months,

06:38.731 --> 06:41.935
and now I feel like
the market's picked up.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.473
So, we need to be
aggressive on price.

06:46.505 --> 06:49.808
When Kristin and I initially
sat down to list her house,

06:49.843 --> 06:53.446
we agreed to list at 34,900,000.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.917
And we showed it like
bananas. And then, COVID hit.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.653
And we just lost all
that beautiful traction

07:01.687 --> 07:03.689
that we had in the 30s.

07:03.723 --> 07:06.158
And so we decided to
pull it from the market.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.279
We have to be more aggressive.

07:08.610 --> 07:10.529
- How aggressive
are we thinking?

07:10.562 --> 07:13.132
- I think that we should take it

07:13.165 --> 07:16.903
just a hair under 30.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.805
- That's a lot.
- Like, if we can just get it

07:18.838 --> 07:20.740
just with a two in front of it,

07:20.774 --> 07:24.310
that we'll get a whole new
pool new pool of buyers.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.778
- I hear that you're saying.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.846
I mean, I did not
have under 30 in mind.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.315
I wanted to leave a
little negotiating room.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.185
I was thinking
more like 32 million.

07:33.218 --> 07:35.487
I will give you
your, 29,900,000.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.568
But you need to deliver.

07:37.569 --> 07:40.726
I know, from your book,
that you not being the agent,

07:40.759 --> 07:41.927
when I bought this house,

07:41.961 --> 07:45.465
was a huge point of
contention with you.

07:45.497 --> 07:47.385
But you're my agent now.

07:47.386 --> 07:50.502
We're not in business
together. You're working for me.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.774
- Kristin is incredibly
hard to impress.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.877
I questioned my
worth as a broker

07:57.911 --> 08:02.149
when she chose not to hire
me when she purchased it.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.851
And I think that has
given our relationship, like,

08:05.884 --> 08:07.887
a more complicated dynamic.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.458
So, prior to it actually
hitting the MLS,

08:11.490 --> 08:12.925
I want to call
some of the agents

08:13.259 --> 08:15.228
that I know have been
interested in the property,

08:15.261 --> 08:16.762
but they weren't
ready to move on it

08:16.795 --> 08:18.163
because of COVID, and you know--

08:18.197 --> 08:19.598
- Let them know first?

08:19.632 --> 08:21.338
That's a great
idea. I like that.

08:21.339 --> 08:22.701
- And then we'll hit
the market running.

08:22.735 --> 08:26.271
I feel strongly that you
become the most competitive

08:26.305 --> 08:29.419
listing in Holmby
Hills, for sure.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.677
- Right.
- I mean, we've got

08:30.709 --> 08:32.449
$100,000,000 properties,

08:32.450 --> 08:37.115
so at 29,900,000, you become
the best thing on the market,

08:37.116 --> 08:39.119
and that's what's gonna
ultimately get us sold

08:39.152 --> 08:40.552
for the highest price.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.721
- I agree.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.389
- Okay, so when
you call me in a week

08:43.423 --> 08:45.125
and I don't have an offer,
are you gonna, like, spank me?

08:45.158 --> 08:48.927
- Well, that's another story.

fireplaces everywhere.

18:09.154 --> 18:12.258
- Great.
- So, welcome to the office.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.295
Library.

18:15.327 --> 18:19.132
There's sexy offices,
and then there's, like, this.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.201
- Yes.
- This is a power office.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.237
- And there's a little secret.

18:24.269 --> 18:28.273
Behind the bookcases, you
have a beautiful powder room here.

18:28.307 --> 18:32.177
- Wow.
- And then a wine room in here.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.615
It is a fully-functioning
wine cellar.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.116
- I see.
- Room for a table...

18:37.150 --> 18:38.509
- Okay.

18:38.839 --> 18:40.353
- And obviously
several thousand bottles.

18:43.690 --> 18:47.227
Where I spend most of my
time when I'm here with her

18:47.259 --> 18:50.663
is in the billiard room.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.634
She did this bar complete onyx.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.935
She wrapped
around all of this brass

18:56.970 --> 18:59.638
and custom-designed
this bar for the house.

18:59.673 --> 19:01.708
- Beautiful.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.910
- She did do this extra detail

19:04.099 --> 19:06.179
of having the sunken
media room space,

19:06.211 --> 19:07.681
because she
liked it to feel cozy.

19:07.713 --> 19:08.847
- And, you know, you
probably have your daughters...

19:08.882 --> 19:10.159
- Yes.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.483
- Living with you.
- Yeah.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.551
- As much as you love
them, they probably want

19:12.585 --> 19:13.787
their own space.
- Right.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.221
- And you probably
want your own space.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.323
And I think this house
really caters for that.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.692
Do you want to explain this?

19:18.724 --> 19:21.260
<i>[rock music]</i>

19:21.294 --> 19:23.829
- So, yeah, she
loves motorcycles,

19:23.863 --> 19:27.701
and also, you know,
guitars. So, she collects.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.269
- Well, it's beautiful.
- Isn't it cool?

19:29.301 --> 19:31.270
- Yeah, it really is.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.442
- Great dining room, obviously.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.278
You walk through the
butler's pantry area,

19:39.311 --> 19:40.880
and you're in the kitchen.

19:43.750 --> 19:49.489
This house has nine
bedrooms, nine bathrooms.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.325
And here is the primary suite,

19:52.358 --> 19:54.493
which is almost
2,000 square feet total.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.597
- This is beautiful.
- So, this is the sitting room.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.866
Once you come in to
the sleeping quarters...

20:02.902 --> 20:05.505
you've got, again,
the repeat of the stone

20:05.538 --> 20:06.839
for where the television is,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.608
and then, again,
another fireplace.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.380
- This is a great
space. This is nice.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.717
- Good size, right?
- Very good size, yes.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.219
- So, huge deck.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.220
Covered and uncovered.
We have a full sauna.

20:22.549 --> 20:24.557
- Well, that's handy.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.460
- Another fireplace out here.

20:27.493 --> 20:31.263
- I think we're on, like,
fireplace 36 right now, Tracy.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.798
- I know! There
really are a lot.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.669
But you can see what I
love a lot about this as well,

20:35.701 --> 20:37.871
is that, from a
privacy standpoint,

20:37.903 --> 20:40.399
you are in a much
better position

20:40.400 --> 20:41.540
to not see your neighbors.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.741
And when you're
paying these price tags,

20:42.776 --> 20:44.099
you shouldn't have to.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.444
- Right. This is lovely.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.779
- This is one thing
I'm gonna point out,

20:46.813 --> 20:48.515
especially in Bel-Air
and Holmby Hills.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.384
Typically, I've sold
properties that are two acres,

20:51.417 --> 20:52.719
that have less flat pad...

20:52.751 --> 20:53.787
- Right.
- Right.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.555
- Than this property does.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.657
So, at 33,000 square foot,
this feels like over an acre to me.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.426
I do love the privacy.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.362
That is the key to a good house.

21:02.394 --> 21:05.397
- Yes.
- The estates in Holmby Hills

21:05.432 --> 21:07.800
are superior to the
flats of Beverly Hills.

21:07.834 --> 21:11.270
They're bigger, they have
less restrictions on privacy,

21:11.304 --> 21:12.505
so the gates are bigger.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.508
Everything screams
the richest of the rich.

21:15.541 --> 21:18.577
You can't even get in
to Holmby Hills for dirt

21:18.611 --> 21:19.945
for under 22 million.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.580
- Do you mind if I take

21:21.614 --> 21:23.828
a couple of photographs...?
- No.

21:23.829 --> 21:24.718
- Just of this area?
'Cause this is phenomenal.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.519
- No, not at all. Absolutely.
- Okay, thank you.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.921
- Just let me know if
you have any questions.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.823
- Okay, thank you.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.590
- What do you think?
- I think he likes it.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.929
I mean, I'll be honest with you,

21:33.930 --> 21:34.961
he's carrying a lot of
real estate right now.

21:34.993 --> 21:37.529
But I told him--he likes
a deal, so I was like,

21:37.564 --> 21:40.099
"Look, Tracy told me
there's an opportunity here.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.968
"It's come off the market.
You can get it below 30.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.569
You should definitely
come and see it."

21:43.603 --> 21:44.770
I believe in it, in case
you haven't noticed.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.306
- Yeah.

21:46.338 --> 21:47.906
- I've been making that
too obvious, aren't I?

21:47.941 --> 21:48.942
- First of all,

21:48.974 --> 21:50.943
can we just talk about
your wrist for a second?

21:50.977 --> 21:53.112
- You're one of the most
stylish people I know.

21:53.113 --> 21:54.480
But this is not about fashion.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.782
- Oh, what is it?
- This is about stress.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.490
- Yes. Anxiety.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.794
- How many beads are
in this necklace, David?

22:10.630 --> 22:11.698
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.767
- And is this, like, a thing?
- For me it is. Yeah.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.434
- Do I need the beads?

22:15.468 --> 22:16.903
- Do you stress?
- Yes!

22:16.935 --> 22:18.404
- They're yours.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.739
- Oh, my God. I'm
gonna see if this works.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.739
- Shall we carry on?
- I promise you it does.

22:21.740 --> 22:22.442
- Sure.
- What are those?

22:22.474 --> 22:23.643
- These are his--what
are they called?

22:23.676 --> 22:24.978
- They're yours now.

22:25.779 --> 22:26.346
- They're--
- They're my worry beads.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.713
- Worry beads.
- Oh, beautiful.

22:27.747 --> 22:28.981

Tracy's worry beads.

22:29.819 --> 22:30.650

- Yes, exactly.

26:45.739 --> 26:47.106
Very popular in
the gay community.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.307
I don't know where that started,

26:48.340 --> 26:50.876
but it's always been that way.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.244
All these people
are good candidates

26:52.278 --> 26:53.579
for Suzanne's property.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.915
- Okay, this is what
you want to see.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.183
- Oh, I love this.

26:58.218 --> 26:59.885
When was the last
time you used this thing?

26:59.919 --> 27:01.855
- Couple weeks ago.
- [laughs]

27:01.887 --> 27:05.250
- But when you lie here and
you look out here, it's fantastic.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.929
This is an original bedroom.
It's a 100-year-old house.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.798
- So pretty.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.200
- There have only
been three owners.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.903
We've been here the
longest, the 43 years.

27:18.672 --> 27:21.409
- When we bought this place,
it was only two bedrooms.

27:21.410 --> 27:22.909
But it's now seven bedrooms.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.913
- Our bedroom suite is up here.

27:27.946 --> 27:30.383
And then we just kept
adding bedrooms suites,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.518
because our family kept growing.

27:32.519 --> 27:35.501
And I was able to give our
boys a normal life up here.

27:35.502 --> 27:38.791
- I love all these buildings.
I'm a little turned around.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.629
You could very easily
get lost on this property.

27:43.630 --> 27:45.932
Outside of the fact that
there's 28 acres out there,

27:45.964 --> 27:48.701
we've got five dwellings.
The bottom is a guesthouse.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.270
Above that, you have the
kitchen, the dining room,

27:51.304 --> 27:53.272
above that an
enormous primary suite,

27:53.306 --> 27:55.842
and then beyond
that, more guestrooms.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.743
And you need one of those
guides, like, from Disneyland.

27:57.777 --> 28:01.714
It's, like, really complicated.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.215
- And this is where I
brought you and Bobby.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.718
- Yeah, we had a
great dinner in here.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.189
- Yeah. There's something--

28:06.190 --> 28:07.252
- It's so nice to sit in here...

28:07.287 --> 28:08.788
- Yeah.
- Versus a formal dining room.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.289
- That's right. I like
to cook, so I cook here

28:10.323 --> 28:13.589
and serve right there,
and I like the connection.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.328
- Remind me, what
are we pricing this at?

28:16.363 --> 28:19.318
- Well, I wanted 10,500,000.

28:19.319 --> 28:20.200
- I think we're still-we're

28:20.232 --> 28:22.167
still shooting a
little high there.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.803
I think we should
go to 8,500,000,

28:23.836 --> 28:25.379
to be honest with you.

28:25.380 --> 28:27.740
- But it's 26 acres - No, 28.

28:27.773 --> 28:28.807
- Or 28 acres...

28:28.842 --> 28:30.143
- Who's counting?

28:30.175 --> 28:31.478
You could have a
25, it's all the same.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.469
- Of prime land. I mean...
- The best.

28:34.470 --> 28:35.749

28:37.500 --> 28:38.451

28:38.484 --> 28:39.818
It's always the same story.

to appreciate it,

28:41.186 --> 28:44.223
<i>share memories
there, understand it."</i>

28:44.257 --> 28:47.160

has a dog that they love,

28:47.192 --> 28:48.427
<i>but they have allergies,</i>

28:48.461 --> 28:50.629
<i>and they have to
give the dog away.</i>

28:50.630 --> 28:52.649
You want it to go to
somebody that likes it.

28:52.650 --> 28:54.768
14.6 million is where
you started, right?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.236
And it's gone through brokers,

28:56.269 --> 28:58.837
and it's gone through a
ton of years on the market.

28:58.872 --> 29:00.906
I'd put it at $8 1/2 million.

29:01.700 --> 29:02.307
And I can tell you
we're gonna generate

29:02.342 --> 29:03.910
a tremendous amount of interest,

29:04.099 --> 29:05.310
and that's the most
you can get in the desert,

29:05.345 --> 29:07.279
'cause, you know,
when was the last time

29:07.313 --> 29:09.150
something went in
multiple offers here,

29:09.490 --> 29:10.349
no matter how hot the market is?

29:10.383 --> 29:12.180
It just doesn't
happen that way here.

29:12.519 --> 29:14.721

29:25.832 --> 29:28.468

million. That's what I think.

29:38.478 --> 29:40.246

29:40.279 --> 29:41.413
- We'll get you the best.

36:17.844 --> 36:19.311
- You too.
- Thanks for coming by.

36:19.346 --> 36:20.480
- No problem.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.215
I have like 30 minutes to
kill between my appointments,

36:23.248 --> 36:24.784
so it's fine. I was
down the street.

36:24.818 --> 36:26.786
- We probably only need five.
- Great.

36:26.820 --> 36:29.489
'Cause I'm gonna turn it
down? What's-what's your point?

36:29.521 --> 36:32.324
- No, it's all gonna be
good. Just take that.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.460
Take the whole thing.
- Oh, God.

36:34.494 --> 36:38.297
I'm so excited that David is
actually bringing me an offer.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.532
I mean, I haven't
hit the market yet.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.668
<i>I feel like I've
priced it right.</i>

36:42.702 --> 36:45.438
Someone's coming to the
table with something for me

36:45.472 --> 36:47.606
to deliver to Kristin.
Let's talk about Mapleton.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.541
- Okay, so look, my
client loved the house.

36:49.576 --> 36:51.577
And I think I've
got a great offer.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.445
24 million.

36:55.248 --> 36:56.916
- 24 million?

36:56.949 --> 37:00.820
I just reduced it--your
lip is quivering a little bit.

37:00.853 --> 37:02.856
- No, it's not. My lip's fine.
- 29,900,000.

37:02.889 --> 37:05.249
I haven't even put
it on the market yet.

37:05.250 --> 37:10.262
You're coming in $5 million
under ask? Almost six.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.565
- Yes.
- I can't pick up the phone

37:12.599 --> 37:15.702
and call her with that offer.

37:15.735 --> 37:18.237
I won't pick up the phone
and call her with that offer.

37:18.271 --> 37:19.539
- Tracy.

37:19.572 --> 37:22.419
- I'm not pulling this house
off the market at $24 million.

37:22.420 --> 37:24.543
- Are you genuinely
telling me that $2,000 a foot

37:24.577 --> 37:26.378
is unreasonable for
a ten-year-old house?

37:26.413 --> 37:28.581
- I'm genuinely
telling you the offer

37:28.614 --> 37:30.499
that you are
bringing me right now,

37:30.500 --> 37:34.420
I won't even present to
my client, sister or not.

37:34.454 --> 37:38.625
A $24 million offer is gonna
fly with my sister like monkeys

37:38.657 --> 37:40.293
flying out of my ass.

37:40.326 --> 37:43.362
It's not happening. She's
going to lose her mind.

37:43.396 --> 37:45.231
- You can like at
Kylie Jenner, okay?

37:45.264 --> 37:46.398
She bought a house, right?

37:46.432 --> 37:47.634
- Right.
- On the same street.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.934
- Yes.
- Brand new construction.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.304
And it traded for
just over 2,000 a foot.

37:51.338 --> 37:52.838
Even though it's
your sister's house...

37:52.871 --> 37:55.474
- Yes.
- $2,000 a foot is exactly

37:55.507 --> 37:58.411
where it should be in
relation to that comp,

37:58.445 --> 38:00.313
which is probably the
best comp out there.

38:00.347 --> 38:01.681
- So, to be clear,

38:01.715 --> 38:04.451
is 24 million your
client's best and final?

38:04.483 --> 38:06.552
- I'm pretty sure.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.855
- So, that, to me,
sounds like a no.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.556
So, why don't you
just text your client

38:10.590 --> 38:12.425
and say that you and I are
sitting across from each other,

38:12.458 --> 38:14.393
and we're having a
discussion about how pathetic

38:14.427 --> 38:16.596
the $24 million offer
you're trying to present me.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.398
- Well, that's not
gonna fly. I will text him.

38:21.701 --> 38:25.304
- Don't look at me like that.
- I'm not. It's in your mind.

38:25.338 --> 38:26.840
- You're much more
charming when you speak.

38:26.873 --> 38:29.943
Maybe you should call him.

38:30.429 --> 38:33.460
- Clearly not that
----ing charming.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.315
- That's how you got Adrienne.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.815
- I actually chased
her around the block.

38:36.849 --> 38:37.916
- Did you?
- She ran.

38:37.951 --> 38:39.853
- Stop it.
- Yeah. Initially, yeah.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.820
- Well, she is Armenian.
She's my people.

38:41.855 --> 38:43.722
- Yeah, tell me about it.

38:45.391 --> 38:48.609
Okay, Tracy, he's just
come up $1 1/2 million.

38:48.610 --> 38:50.896
He's at 25.5 million.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.599
- Well, I can assure
you of one thing.

38:52.632 --> 38:55.367
- Mm-hmm.
- She's not gonna take that.

38:55.402 --> 38:57.469
But it's worthy of
me presenting it.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.539
And I will take credit
for the $1 1/2 million

38:59.572 --> 39:01.807
I just got out of you. Let
me actually grab my phone.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.376
- You absolutely should.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.744
- I'm gonna sight, and
you get up and leave me.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.478
- Yeah, yeah, no,
absolutely, I will.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.138
- All right. I'm gonna
relax in your backyard.

39:08.139 --> 39:09.882
Come back in five.

- Hi. How are you?

39:22.929 --> 39:24.364
- I'm good.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.800
So, remember the guy I
told you wanted to get in

39:26.833 --> 39:31.670
before we go to market,
David Parnes, with his client?

39:31.704 --> 39:32.871
- Okay.

39:32.905 --> 39:34.106
- So, he just called
me and asked me

39:34.139 --> 39:35.608
to come over to the house,

39:35.641 --> 39:38.411
and he wanted to talk
to me about an offer.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.459
- Yeah.

39:40.460 --> 39:42.114
- Well, it's not
where I want it to be.

39:42.148 --> 39:45.510
But the offer is, after
a little bit of discussion

39:45.849 --> 39:47.887
and what have you...

39:47.920 --> 39:50.856
- It's 25,500,000.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.735
- I get it. Obviously, I'm--

40:04.103 --> 40:05.938
- It's not that we're
not on the same page.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.706
And I'm not even saying
anything other than

40:07.740 --> 40:12.144
that obviously I have
this offer in hand right now,

40:12.177 --> 40:13.947
and I think sometimes
a bird in the hand

40:13.980 --> 40:15.815
can be better than
two in the bush.

40:20.887 --> 40:23.559
- Okay. All right. Well,
then, let me just--let me

40:23.889 --> 40:24.690
just get back to
you a little later.

40:24.724 --> 40:26.626
Maybe we can talk
tomorrow or something.

40:26.659 --> 40:29.396
- All right. Talk to you later.
[line disconnects]

40:31.530 --> 40:34.099
- I wouldn't say that
Kristin and I are competitive,

40:34.134 --> 40:38.102
but we're both, like,
super strong personalities

40:38.103 --> 40:41.907
that sometimes collide. David?

40:41.940 --> 40:45.612
I think there's just a part
of me that would like her

40:45.644 --> 40:48.614
to at least acknowledge
that getting the offer

40:48.648 --> 40:50.784
<i>before it even goes to
market is a good thing.</i>

40:50.817 --> 40:53.190
There's no, like,
positive reinforcement,

40:53.530 --> 40:54.887
<i>and so I'm struggling with that,</i>

40:54.920 --> 40:58.692
because I don't know
how to make her happy.

40:58.724 --> 41:02.661
Well, that went about as well
as I anticipated it would go.

41:02.695 --> 41:04.931
- Really?
- Listen, I mean,

41:04.963 --> 41:07.599
she pretty much shut
me down completely

41:07.634 --> 41:09.902
and said she wouldn't
have the discussion.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.471
If you want a sentiment,

41:11.503 --> 41:15.108
I would say it sounded
like a "go (BLEEP) yourself."

41:15.141 --> 41:17.777
- Excellent.
- It is what it is.

41:17.811 --> 41:20.646

me of someone.</i>

41:24.918 --> 41:26.552
Well, I'm sorry.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.588
I didn't intend to, like,
create family politics.

41:28.621 --> 41:30.190
- It's not family politics.
- I'm just doing a job.

41:30.222 --> 41:33.929
- It's business, and we're
doing the best that we can.

41:33.930 --> 41:35.795
- [sighs] Okay.

41:39.498 --> 41:42.100

41:42.101 --> 41:44.971
- Do you have them?
- I do!

41:45.500 --> 41:46.806
- Do you really?
- In my car.

41:46.840 --> 41:49.708
- I'll come and get them.

41:49.742 --> 41:50.809
<i>- Coming up...</i>

41:50.844 --> 41:53.146
- I don't think you
understand the gravity of this,

because if it wasn't
for that dream

41:55.248 --> 41:56.849

taking you to, I found.

It's very, like, when you
think about Palm Springs,

42:18.710 --> 42:21.240
but I wanted something that
had a lot of space, a lot of land.

42:21.273 --> 42:23.643
I think it has a
mix of what I like.

42:23.677 --> 42:25.577
- Have you run the comps?

little high for what it is.

- Wow.

- This is really special.
- Yeah.

42:43.963 --> 42:46.800
Do me a favor, because this
is his schtick and not mine,

42:46.833 --> 42:48.268
and I don't really know
Palm Springs as well.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.869
- Oh.
- What is this location?

42:49.902 --> 42:51.905
- We're in what's
called Little Tuscany.

42:51.938 --> 42:53.306
- What about Suzanne Somers?

42:53.340 --> 42:54.708
- People would say, "I'd
rather be in Little Tuscany

42:54.740 --> 42:56.175
versus the Mesa." Yes.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.210
- That's all I needed to know.
- That's it.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.844
- Okay.

- I'd rather be in, like,

much more attuned

43:02.782 --> 43:04.284
to what's happening in
the Palm Springs market,

43:04.317 --> 43:07.529
because he's done a lot
more research than I have.

43:07.530 --> 43:09.289
Bobby's got a great
eye for real estate,

43:09.322 --> 43:12.192
and clearly impeccable
taste in men.

43:12.224 --> 43:14.598
- They want to sell
this furnished or no?

43:14.599 --> 43:16.262
- Actually, we've
included in the price--all

43:16.295 --> 43:18.697
the outdoor Schultz--Richard
Schultz furniture...

43:18.731 --> 43:20.132
- Yeah.
- Is included. And indoors,

43:20.166 --> 43:23.397
it's pretty much--would
be available upon request.

43:23.398 --> 43:24.971
- Okay. Let's take a look.

43:28.307 --> 43:30.110
That's a Wilfredo Lam chair.

43:30.143 --> 43:31.777
- It is. Yep, love that.
- It's a great chair.

43:31.811 --> 43:33.789

really good chair.

I mean, this is Nakashima.

There's, like, everything--

43:35.882 --> 43:38.784
Tommi Parzinger lamps.
- Exactly.

43:38.818 --> 43:41.621
- The owner is a very
well-known interior designer.

43:41.653 --> 43:44.224
- That's really,
really interesting.

43:44.257 --> 43:46.919
This house was definitely
done by somebody

43:46.920 --> 43:49.295
who knows what they're
doing. It's got good pieces.

43:49.329 --> 43:51.630

lot of fluff and bullsh--.

some sh-- from Topshop.

- Kitchen's a little small,
but I guess maybe--

44:02.420 --> 44:03.108
- What do you expect?

44:03.143 --> 44:06.346
- People don't cook here much.

44:06.378 --> 44:09.488
- Where's the hidden bar? Yes.

44:09.489 --> 44:10.349
- Oh, my God, this
is a St. Charles.

44:10.382 --> 44:11.951
- I love how this
is the same color

44:12.519 --> 44:13.318
as my grandmother's
phone in her kitchen,

44:13.353 --> 44:15.549
you know, with, like,
the long, 100-foot cord.

44:15.550 --> 44:16.856
- Yep, yep, yep.
- It's like that avocado green.

44:16.889 --> 44:18.257
- Avocado color.
- Yeah.

44:18.291 --> 44:19.893
- It's the original color
from when it was done.

44:19.925 --> 44:21.795
- It's fantastic.

44:25.650 --> 44:26.699
- These are all
really large lots.

44:26.733 --> 44:27.934
They're over half an acre.

44:27.967 --> 44:29.135
- How do you keep it so green?

44:29.168 --> 44:31.304
- All the irrigation
was replaced.

44:31.338 --> 44:35.375
- This is fantastic,
especially from this view.

44:35.407 --> 44:37.143
I would think it
would be a good idea

44:37.177 --> 44:38.344
to bring Suzanne
and Alan down here

44:38.378 --> 44:40.799
and look at-- see
what their opinion is.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.715
- They would say, "Oh,
this is like our guesthouse."

44:41.748 --> 44:42.748
[laughter]

44:42.782 --> 44:44.684
- We have their house
listed now, if you want--

44:44.717 --> 44:46.860
- Oh.
- If you have a buyer, maybe.

44:46.119 --> 44:47.853
- Okay. She's had
it, for a while, listed.

44:47.887 --> 44:48.887
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:48.922 --> 44:51.123
- But she didn't have
it listed with me before.

44:51.157 --> 44:53.259
- That's what's gonna sell it.
[laughter]

44:54.893 --> 44:56.362
- Is this the primary bedroom?

44:56.396 --> 44:57.530
- Yeah.

44:57.563 --> 45:00.328
Lots of light, and every
room has a slider going out.

45:00.329 --> 45:04.436
It's totally the indoor/outdoor
concept of Palm Springs living.

45:04.471 --> 45:06.206
- See, I would make
this the master, actually.

45:06.239 --> 45:07.806
- I think it's really great,
too, because of the pool.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.907
- Yeah.

45:08.942 --> 45:10.710
- But you're gonna get daylight.

45:10.744 --> 45:12.311
- The morning sun comes in.
- The what's it called? The--

45:12.344 --> 45:13.746

put blackout shades.

- Yeah, look at the
bathroom, though.

It's not gonna
work as the master.

45:16.949 --> 45:18.840

- Yeah, it's a smaller bath.

45:18.117 --> 45:19.385
- I could do whatever I want.

45:19.418 --> 45:21.539
- I'm just saying,
in terms of resale.

45:21.869 --> 45:22.722
- I'm not planning on
selling anytime, Joshua.

45:22.755 --> 45:25.578
I'm planning on
having it until I'm 80.

45:25.579 --> 45:27.393
Because there's, like, a lot
of usable space on the lot,

45:27.427 --> 45:28.827
what are the restrictions

45:28.862 --> 45:30.960
if I wanted to build,
like, a little casita?

45:30.130 --> 45:31.398
- Well, actually, you can do it.

45:31.431 --> 45:32.699
- Yes. See, that's
what I want to do.

45:32.731 --> 45:33.833
- That corner there...
- Yeah.

45:33.867 --> 45:35.300
- Has the best view.

45:35.335 --> 45:36.869
- 'Cause I have a lot
of friends that have kids.

45:36.902 --> 45:38.304
It's like, you would
put them there.

45:38.338 --> 45:40.729
Like, it has its own
bathroom, a kitchenette.

45:40.730 --> 45:42.749
- Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.
- Okay. This closes up, huh?

45:42.750 --> 45:44.768
- Yeah, so basically, this
is a--the third bedroom.

45:44.769 --> 45:45.411
They didn't know if they
were gonna have guests.

45:45.445 --> 45:46.880
- I was hoping that you
were gonna tell me that

45:46.913 --> 45:48.809
it was not the third bedroom,

45:48.114 --> 45:49.315
that I could make
this a third bedroom.

45:49.349 --> 45:50.916
- You can make it
the third bedroom.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.385
There's two proper bedrooms,

45:52.418 --> 45:54.454
and this is on the tax
roles as the third bedroom.

45:54.487 --> 45:55.989
- Gotcha.

45:56.889 --> 45:57.257
- What are the comps
in the neighborhood?

45:57.289 --> 46:00.126
- There's one a
street over that sold

46:00.159 --> 46:01.860
for just about this asking.

46:01.894 --> 46:03.762
There's one another
street over there,

46:03.797 --> 46:06.231
sold about six months
ago, for 3,000,000.

46:06.266 --> 46:08.902
But the market is different
six months ago than it is now.

46:08.934 --> 46:10.401
Everything's lifted.

46:10.402 --> 46:11.871
- Right.
- Yeah.

46:11.905 --> 46:15.107
So, I'll let you kind of just
wander around, drink it all in.

46:15.108 --> 46:16.242
- I'll see you in two days.
- Yes.

46:16.275 --> 46:20.459
- Just give me the keys. So,
what do you think, Joshua?

46:20.460 --> 46:22.479
- I think it's wonderful.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.784
I'm trying to figure out,
how to create value here?

46:24.818 --> 46:26.518
- Oh, I was just talking to him.

46:26.519 --> 46:27.253
I could build a casita out here.

46:27.286 --> 46:28.487
You want to see
where I'd put it?

46:28.521 --> 46:30.456
- No.
<i>[dramatic musical sting]</i>

46:30.489 --> 46:32.192
- All right. Well, I don't
know why you asked.

46:32.224 --> 46:34.126
- I want to know how you
can get a third bedroom in the--

46:34.159 --> 46:36.329
- A casita is a third bedroom.
It would have a bathroom.

46:36.362 --> 46:39.649
- I gotcha. Just let
me finish my sentence.

46:39.650 --> 46:40.199
- Okay.

46:40.233 --> 46:41.967
- Where can you
add a third bedroom

46:42.679 --> 46:44.103
in the structure to maximize

46:44.137 --> 46:46.206
and get more square
footage, plus the casita?

46:46.239 --> 46:47.940
That's what I'm trying to say.
And that's what I'm thinking.

46:47.974 --> 46:49.442
- I don't think that
that's important,

46:49.476 --> 46:50.476
and I don't think you know
the Palm Springs market

46:50.510 --> 46:51.811
as well as I do. So.

46:51.844 --> 46:53.512
- You are 100%
correct. I do not.

46:53.545 --> 46:55.949
- [inhales]

46:55.981 --> 46:56.983
All right.

46:57.829 --> 46:59.518
- My only concern is how
do you create value here?

46:59.552 --> 47:01.487
- I just tried to tell you how
I was gonna create value,

47:01.521 --> 47:03.322
and you didn't want to
get up from your chair.

47:03.356 --> 47:06.525
So, maybe I'm just not
ready to hear your opinion.

47:06.559 --> 47:08.527
It's a big deal for me.
It's not a spec house.

47:08.561 --> 47:09.795
- I get it.

47:09.829 --> 47:13.329
It would just be nice if you
could also have another bedroom

47:13.659 --> 47:14.434
and keep this as the den,

47:14.467 --> 47:16.335
and then market this as a
potential fourth bedroom.

47:16.369 --> 47:18.137
- That's where you
and I differ a little bit.

47:18.170 --> 47:19.239
- Okay.

47:19.271 --> 47:20.940
- Because this is a--
- Got you.

47:21.409 --> 47:23.476
- This is 15 years of a dream.
- I got you. I'm just--

47:23.510 --> 47:25.378
- But you don't have me.

47:25.411 --> 47:27.480
I don't think you
understand the gravity of this,

47:27.514 --> 47:30.500
because-- [clears throat]

47:31.384 --> 47:33.152
At that time, my
parents were alive,

47:33.186 --> 47:35.855
and I said, "if I buy a big
house in Palm Springs,

47:35.889 --> 47:37.423
"can't you guys just
go live out there?

47:37.456 --> 47:39.920
"Then you'd never have
to worry about anything.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.293
"I'll take care of the house.

47:40.326 --> 47:42.128
"I'll take care of
your expenses.

47:42.161 --> 47:43.963
And you'll live there."

47:44.639 --> 47:47.099
What I'm saying is this is
not something I'm buying

47:47.132 --> 47:48.601
because I want to
make a million bucks on.

47:48.635 --> 47:52.338
I'm buying it because,
if it wasn't for that dream

47:52.371 --> 47:55.507
that I still have
with my parents,

47:55.541 --> 47:57.177
I would buy a smaller house.

47:57.210 --> 47:58.478
- I got it.
- I just want to be able

47:58.510 --> 47:59.913
to close that chapter,
where I'm like,

48:00.130 --> 48:01.414
"Okay, guys, I did
it," kind of thing.

48:01.447 --> 48:02.916
- Okay. So, I'm totally
giving my stamp of approval.

48:03.159 --> 48:04.217
- And so when you're--I know,

48:04.250 --> 48:05.518
but you keep talking
about third bedroom.

48:05.552 --> 48:06.585
Guess what? My
parents aren't here.

48:06.619 --> 48:08.539
There's no third bedroom needed.

48:08.880 --> 48:09.188
- Okay. Hey, hey,
can we calm down?

48:09.222 --> 48:10.889
Just let me--
- I am calm.

48:10.923 --> 48:13.259
- Let me get a sentence in.
My question still is is there

48:13.260 --> 48:15.161
a place for a fourth
bedroom, inside the structure?

48:15.195 --> 48:17.396
- There is. Well, there is.
- Where?

48:17.429 --> 48:18.931
- There is. This is
the third bedroom.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.934
You need a four-bedroom
main house...

48:21.340 --> 48:22.469
- Okay.
- In Palm Springs.

48:22.501 --> 48:24.369
- To me, that's awkward,

48:24.699 --> 48:26.239
but I'm not a Palm Springs
buyer, so I don't know.

48:26.271 --> 48:27.639
- Forget it, Josh. Forget it.

48:27.673 --> 48:29.376
I can't do this with
you. Such bullsh--.

48:29.409 --> 48:31.210
- Why are we getting
worked up? I don't understand.

48:31.244 --> 48:33.346
- I'm just sick of this. I'm
sick of the manipulation.

48:41.755 --> 48:43.558
- When I think about
this, I think about us

48:43.559 --> 48:45.224
bringing our new dog here.

48:45.257 --> 48:47.393
I think--forget it, Josh.

48:47.427 --> 48:49.539
Forget it. I can't
do this with you.

48:49.540 --> 48:50.963
- Hey.
- Such bullsh--.

48:51.639 --> 48:52.565
- Calm down.
- How is that being supportive?

48:52.599 --> 48:54.669
It's not.

48:54.670 --> 48:56.369
- Hey. This is like a
dog and pony show.

48:56.402 --> 48:58.371
- I keep saying the
same the over again.

48:58.405 --> 49:02.420
- Honestly, let's just
wrap it. I'm just sick of this.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.376
<i>I...</i>

49:04.411 --> 49:05.411

my husband in that room?

49:09.150 --> 49:12.452

This is a big moment.

49:12.485 --> 49:14.387
It's not just today.
It's not just a house.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.456
It's very emotional
for me. It's something

49:16.489 --> 49:19.224
<i>that was supposed to be
for my family for generations.</i>

49:19.259 --> 49:22.128

more from him today.

49:22.161 --> 49:24.563
- I'm not saying
to you don't buy it.

49:24.597 --> 49:27.534
Even if there's no value to
add to it, a dream is a dream.

49:27.567 --> 49:29.436
Who cares? And it's just money.

49:29.469 --> 49:31.137
- That's where we're
missing. It's not just money.

49:31.170 --> 49:32.405
- Okay.

49:32.438 --> 49:34.399
- It's not--I didn't
grow up like you.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.208
I didn't grow up
with a wealthy family.

49:36.242 --> 49:37.543
I didn't grow up
with a trust fund.

49:37.577 --> 49:41.380
So, for me, purchasing
a house like this,

49:41.414 --> 49:42.581
a $3 1/2 million home...

49:42.614 --> 49:44.500
- Right.
- Coming where I come from...

49:44.840 --> 49:46.251
- Okay.
- It's a big deal.

49:46.286 --> 49:49.120
- Look, I totally get
your--where you're coming from.

49:49.121 --> 49:50.623
I'm just look at
this as a broker.

49:50.657 --> 49:52.625
But that's because I'm
just trying to be protective.

49:52.659 --> 49:55.461
And I'm just trying to look at
where you can create value,

<i>- [laughs]</i>

53:20.567 --> 53:22.202
- (BLEEP) up like this.
I can't lose like this.

53:22.235 --> 53:23.702
Why are you
laughing? It's not funny.

53:38.251 --> 53:39.818
- [sighs]

53:47.293 --> 53:51.864
- The losses, the fiascoes,
they hurt as much, still,

53:51.898 --> 53:54.501
after 20 years
doing this. It's, like--

54:11.784 --> 54:13.353
- Well, thank you.

54:13.385 --> 54:15.454
Are you gonna eat some
Swedish meatballs tonight?

54:16.856 --> 54:18.391
- Yes.

54:19.458 --> 54:21.561
- Okay. I love you so much.

54:21.594 --> 54:23.530
- You're my hero.

54:23.563 --> 54:25.231
- Thank you.
[speaks Swedish]

54:25.264 --> 54:27.599
<i>[sighs] Okay.</i>

54:27.634 --> 54:29.869
<i>- Next time on "Million
Dollar Listing LA"...</i>

54:29.902 --> 54:31.538
- I'm just the mom.

54:31.570 --> 54:33.505
- You're just the mom, with
three awesome daughters.

54:33.539 --> 54:34.541
Love it.

54:34.574 --> 54:36.409
All right. Are you guys
attached to the house?

54:36.443 --> 54:38.311
- Yeah.
- I can't really move my feet.

54:38.344 --> 54:40.713
I'm too attached. [laughter]

54:40.746 --> 54:42.514
- You know I got some
showings right now.

54:42.548 --> 54:44.839
- I know. We weren't
supposed to be here.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.518
- There's mold here?
- No, this--

54:46.552 --> 54:48.554
- I mean, have you had
the house mold remediated?

54:48.588 --> 54:49.489
- This is a little distracting,

54:49.521 --> 54:51.925
Josh--all these signs
around the house.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.992
- I do apologize.
- Sorry, I have to go.

54:55.929 --> 54:57.731
- This is original.
- This is all authentic.

54:57.764 --> 54:58.931
- Yeah, there's not a lot

54:58.965 --> 55:00.567
of houses like this,
that are still here.

55:00.599 --> 55:01.867
- A lot of people that are
coming here right now,

55:01.900 --> 55:03.402
they want to get out
of where they are,

55:03.436 --> 55:04.670
and they want to get
into something now,

55:04.704 --> 55:06.388
so the idea of
taking on a project

55:06.389 --> 55:07.740
that might take several
years to complete

55:07.773 --> 55:09.641
might not be so
appealing to them.

55:11.443 --> 55:13.346
- How's things going
with your sister Kristin?

55:13.380 --> 55:15.849
- If I don't pull this off,
what's she gonna do,

55:15.882 --> 55:17.550
fire me and hire someone else,

55:17.583 --> 55:19.619
and then our relationship
is, like, forever ruined?

55:19.652 --> 55:22.288
It's just, like, a lot at stake.
