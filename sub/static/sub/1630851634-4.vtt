00:18.018 --> 00:19.394
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:19.477 --> 00:23.064
[Goodwin] It's been three days
since the disappearance of Natalie Engler.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.858
-Falco.
-We found the ring.

00:24.941 --> 00:25.859
Okay.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.652
Love, this is my son, Theo.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.987
Didn't know you had a son.

00:29.070 --> 00:32.949
I'm still very unclear
as to why you decided to volunteer here.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.243
I'm at the hospital.
Henry has the measles.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.829
-Who do you think it was?
-Not closed yet, are you?

00:37.912 --> 00:40.248
Can't tell you
how sorry we are for exposing Henry.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.167
We hope you won't hold it against us.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.543
-Hey, Gil.
-Yep?

01:07.984 --> 01:10.403
[Joe]
Well, this came sooner than expected.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.406
The proverbial paint is hardly dry.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.908
Breathing.

01:14.991 --> 01:19.704
It's more than I can say for Natalie.
Meaning, you did the right thing.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.168
Controlled your impulses.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.007
So I won't be frustrated
with you, Love. No.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.217
This is growth,

01:32.300 --> 01:35.386
and it's important I show you
I recognize it--

01:35.470 --> 01:37.388
No. Appreciate it.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.309
I'll set aside the fact that we're using
our son's baby monitor as surveillance.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.686
It's twisted but smart.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.938
[Gil groaning]

01:46.481 --> 01:48.399
[Joe] Hey, Gil. Hey, buddy.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.819
Hey there.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.779
Hey.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.030
She hit me.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.407
[groaning]

01:56.491 --> 01:57.325
I'm so sorry.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.410
"Slipped and hit your head" is
off the table.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.287
Your wife. She knocked me out.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.081
[Joe] Can't say it was a shock.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.332
I was shocked.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.502
I said, "Gil? Nice guy Gil?"

02:07.585 --> 02:09.671
'Course she told me what you said.

02:10.755 --> 02:15.218
Not that it justified what she did.
The thing is, if you could have seen...

02:16.344 --> 02:19.013
what she went through
in the hospital with our baby...

02:19.806 --> 02:20.640
Here.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.065
Still, she should not have done this.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.316
That's for sure.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.241
It's a proofing room.
Something about temperature and humidity.

02:38.324 --> 02:42.954
Keeps the dough from getting a tough skin.
I'm not sure I understand any of it.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.290
That's Margaret with her gardening.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.626
Seeds and soil pH and...

02:48.710 --> 02:51.129
[Joe] Friendly chatter's
a reflex with this guy.

02:51.212 --> 02:55.175
You may have assaulted the one person
who might give us a pass for this.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.760
Love and I are very embarrassed.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.346
Is there any chance
we could keep this between us?

03:00.430 --> 03:03.850
We will not tell a soul
how you recklessly endangered our son.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.853
-I don't know I would put it like that.
-No? How?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.690
Well, it's just-- No judgment.

03:10.773 --> 03:14.277
But to dose an infant
with chemicals we know nothing about?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.487
-I mean, I call that reckless.
-Hmm.

03:16.571 --> 03:20.158
Actually, your son has naturally
gained immunity, so...

03:20.950 --> 03:22.493
I'd say it was beneficial.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.661
[knuckles cracking]

03:26.831 --> 03:28.333
You know what? I'm sorry.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.502
-I'm sorry, I get carried away.
-No, no, no.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.048
You might be right, yeah.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.885
-Our child is fine.
-Yeah.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.597
Here.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.022
Here, let me help you up.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.067
[Gil grunts]

03:54.150 --> 03:55.068
Ooh.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.242
So, what do you say, bygones?

04:08.873 --> 04:09.791
Okay.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.086
Sure. Bygones.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.548
[Joe] He's lying.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.926
-Are you absolutely sure?
-[Gil] I'm cool!

04:20.009 --> 04:22.011
I'm cool. Let me out, please?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.138
No doubt. He'll go straight to the police.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.766
-Fuck.
-Guys, let's be grown-ups about this!

04:26.849 --> 04:28.810
-Now what?
-Come on!

04:41.114 --> 04:43.574
Here we go. Coming in hot, Henry. Hey.

04:43.658 --> 04:48.162
[sputtering] Got to bank to the left.
Here. Open. There we go.

04:48.246 --> 04:51.291
Peek in our window,
you see your typical suburban family

04:51.374 --> 04:52.792
having a typical morning.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.711
You know, it can be blissful...

04:55.336 --> 04:57.922
watching our son discover
the pleasures of sweet potatoes.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.090
All I really need.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.425
I did have a thought.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.804
Mutually-assured destruction.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.099
Get something that he doesn't want
anyone else to know about

05:08.182 --> 05:10.143
and he can't expose us.

05:11.477 --> 05:15.106
-He opens his mouth, we open ours.
-Worked for me once before.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.108
It would have, Benji.

05:17.191 --> 05:20.320
-He may look like a choirboy...
-So did Dahmer.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.378
[Joe] A plan in place,
a Monday's worth of returns.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.924
I got lots of time to learn what Gil's
hiding behind the Mr. Rogers persona.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.472
Okay. All right. So Google
out of my boss's eagle-eyeline.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.641
Kids are gonna commit hara-kiri.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.144
No child sacrifice in the library, please.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.855
Gil is MIA. He was our reader today,

05:55.938 --> 05:58.274
and I told Lansing
I'd run the boys to the dentist.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.361
-[Joe] He did not just say "Gil."
-That's so not like Gil.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.238
He's their favorite. Man's a saint.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.658
[Joe] Except for that one dark thing
about him that Dante knows?

06:07.742 --> 06:10.661
You know better than that.
Not even the saints were saints.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.705
Hey, sorry. I couldn't help but overhear.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.624
-I could read to the kids.
-I've got it.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.708
Okay.

06:17.293 --> 06:21.005
Joe Goldberg? Hi.
Did I know you work here?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.549
[Joe] Did I know you had
your breasts enhanced in 2017?

06:23.633 --> 06:26.344
Vlogged your recovery
from Adderall addiction?

06:26.427 --> 06:28.679
Brother's a roadie
for 5 Seconds of Summer?

06:28.763 --> 06:29.889
Cool to post this?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.812
[Gil over phone] This is stupid!

06:36.562 --> 06:38.731
Hey, hello? Hey!

06:39.232 --> 06:41.943
-Hey, you--
-I could have one of everything.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
Well, I wouldn't tell.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.030
But my ass would.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.783
God, I envy you, Love.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.369
I have so many photo shoots,
next thing you know,

06:51.452 --> 06:53.913
people will be calling me "brave"
and then unfollowing

06:53.996 --> 06:56.666
'cause I'm no longer aspirational.
[chuckles]

06:56.749 --> 06:57.959
Mind if I post this?

06:58.042 --> 06:58.960
Oh.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.379
Perfect. Okay, ciao.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.172
Ciao.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.842
[door opens, then bells chiming]

07:08.928 --> 07:10.221
-Fuck.
-[Joe] Love, listen.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.890
[Love] That ring, it was supposed
to look like she left it there,

07:12.974 --> 07:15.476
then moved on,
but of course they want to look there.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.397
-What if we missed something else?
-We control what we can.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.898
We keep up appearances.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.235
We volunteer to help with the search.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.030
-God.
-It's gonna be okay.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.241
Okay.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.910
I'll see you at home.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.459
[Joe] A man in a cage is a problem.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.711
Few hundred citizens combing the woods

07:41.794 --> 07:43.880
where we buried
and exhumed Natalie Engler?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.381
Full-stop crisis.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.388
[Theo]
I don't understand why I would go to this!

07:52.472 --> 07:55.099
-[Matthew] Theo, can you be reasonable?
-You can't make me volunteer!

07:55.183 --> 07:59.770
-That's implied in the word "volunteer"--
-Theo! Keep your voice down.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.315
Dad, they're making you look pathetic.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.859
I am not going.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.905
When you're ready to talk like a person
above the age of 6, I'll be inside.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.919
Hey, was the idea to be so loud,
the whole neighborhood could hear?

08:24.045 --> 08:27.006
'Cause that was gauche.
You sounded like a brat.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.509
You little peeping Tom. You spying on me?

08:29.592 --> 08:30.760
[Love chuckles]

08:30.843 --> 08:33.095
What's up with all the dad theatrics?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.014
Um...

08:35.097 --> 08:38.851
So, apparently, Sherry Conrad
and her creepy little squad

08:38.935 --> 08:43.064
are teaming up with the cops
to go search some state park

08:43.147 --> 08:46.984
to, like, I don't know,
find Natalie out there stacking rocks?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.028
You don't want to join?

08:49.111 --> 08:52.657
I've been waiting
for this opportunity to join a cabal

08:52.740 --> 08:55.660
of soulless, bulimic yoga moms.
I think it's my calling.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.628
They're convinced that he killed her.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.091
I don't want him helping
the villagers sharpen their pitchforks.

09:12.927 --> 09:17.223
You should go. Optics are a thing.
If you don't go, both of you look bad.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.642
Hey, hey, hey.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.813
I will be your search buddy. Hmm?

09:23.896 --> 09:24.939
[gasps]

09:26.732 --> 09:28.401
Tie my shoes and everything?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.278
If necessary.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.490
Brat.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.910
Hey, you should get this fixed by the way.

09:42.832 --> 09:46.043
[Joe] This "Hands Across
Madre Linda" exercise in the woods

09:46.127 --> 09:48.170
has me dangerously distracted.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.593
What if we did leave something
for John and Betty Volunteer to find?

09:54.510 --> 09:57.305
But we weren't careless, were we?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.473
Focus! One thing at a time.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.103
Need to find Gil's fatal flaw.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.024
"Geology rocks." "Schist happens."

10:08.107 --> 10:11.444
If I've mined anything, it's that
"Rock Star" Professor Gil Brigham

10:11.527 --> 10:13.279
has a taste for geologist humor.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.032
Once taught at Burgess College
in Columbus, Ohio.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.076
Left in his second year. In October. Hmm.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.161
It's abrupt.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.913
Did he transgress with a co-ed?

10:22.997 --> 10:25.666
"Sophomore Burgess student
victim of campus attack."

10:25.750 --> 10:27.335
Could it be...?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.420
Hmm.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.925
Four hours in
and the only fault I can find

10:35.009 --> 10:36.719
is Gil's sense of humor.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.889
Spotless academic career, church,
a dedication to his kids so deep

10:39.972 --> 10:42.850
he may be the inspiration
for those World's Greatest Dad mugs.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.977
Never misses a game, a birthday--

10:45.061 --> 10:47.063
Look, he volunteers
at the children's ward--

10:47.146 --> 10:48.856
And shit! The library.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.441
Better account for today.

10:51.442 --> 10:55.613
Sorry to miss today. A little work crisis.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.990
Sorry to disappoint the kids.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.825
-[Marienne] Who are we stalking?
-Hey.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.411
-No, no, I'm just--
-You seen Peer Gynt?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.580
[Joe] Yes. In that I stole it for Ellie.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.958
Yeah, I may have taken it home for a read.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.420
You took a 2500-dollar book
that isn't supposed to leave?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.215
You know how when you know a rule exists,

11:14.298 --> 11:16.550
but you don't think it applies to you

11:16.634 --> 11:19.011
because you're quick
and careful, and you work here.

11:19.095 --> 11:23.015
For those of us who didn't grow up
with first editions for coasters--

11:23.099 --> 11:25.726
I'm sorry,
you think that I come from money?

11:25.810 --> 11:28.854
Look what you've done to me, Love.
I smell like the rich now.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.356
Just let me say this.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.983
There were no first editions
on the shelves growing up

11:33.067 --> 11:35.152
because there were no... shelves.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.863
-Right. You were poor.
-Practically homeless.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.492
A bookstore owner took me in
and let me work for free,

11:41.575 --> 11:44.120
and I slept in a cage in his basement.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.790
No, wait. Marienne, hang on.
Wait, I'm sorry.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.335
I'm sorry. Stop. That crossed the line.
It was an exaggeration.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.671
We straddled the poverty line
my entire childhood,

11:53.754 --> 11:57.049
and I escaped with books.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.884
I learned all about them,

11:58.968 --> 12:01.637
like you wanna know everything
about that one beautiful thing.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.391
It saves your miserable life.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.310
So I...

12:09.520 --> 12:12.273
I misjudged a little, maybe.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.735
Generally, my favorite apologies
are stiff and grudging...

12:17.278 --> 12:18.112
Fair.

12:19.029 --> 12:19.864
I'm sorry.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.031
Ah...

12:23.617 --> 12:26.996
And I guess I might have
to like you after all, Goldberg.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.373
-Perish the thought.
-Hmm.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.377
Since we're friends now,
what else did you take?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.504
[Joe] A Dickens, a Shelley,
a signed early Strand.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.672
-Nothing.
-Mm-hm.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.384
Make sure that's still true
when I look real hard tomorrow.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.302
Okay?

12:50.811 --> 12:53.314
-[Gil] Thought we had a deal!
-We did. I'm sorry.

12:53.397 --> 12:57.109
You know, you can't keep me in here
like some animal.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.739
People know that I was coming here.
So you can let me out or the police can.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.284
-When they come looking--
-No one's gonna save you. We--

13:06.660 --> 13:09.538
We already made excuses on your behalf.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.332
Uh...

13:11.415 --> 13:14.502
I'm sorry, Gil.
I want to let you out, man.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.712
I won't tell a soul.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.838
I promise.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.925
I told you, we can keep this between us.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.262
Say...

13:26.680 --> 13:28.390
we knew something about you.

13:28.474 --> 13:33.938
Something you really don't want
anyone to know.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.150
Right, I see.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.861
Okay, I keep your secret, you keep mine.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.865
And this time,
you'll keep your end of the deal?

13:44.949 --> 13:45.825
Yes.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.702
Okay. Okay.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.957
Just-- Give me a minute to think.

13:56.377 --> 13:57.211
I got it!

13:58.003 --> 13:58.963
Okay, listen.

14:01.257 --> 14:06.011
Couple years back, our church group went
to a festival for Christ in Vegas.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.473
[Joe] Christ? Vegas?
Strong starter ingredients.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.810
We raised funds for the Santoses,

14:12.893 --> 14:14.937
who'd lost their home to a fire.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.817
And now, there's this woman, Cheryl.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.361
[Joe] Christ. Vegas. Cheryl.

14:23.153 --> 14:26.115
Real, you know, fun-lover.
You know the type.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.535
Anyway, everyone else had gone to bed,

14:29.618 --> 14:33.497
but she and I have
a little more in our tanks.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.456
So...

14:35.958 --> 14:40.045
So we take the 600 dollars
that we'd raised, and...

14:41.046 --> 14:43.757
[Joe] A room with a pile of blow
and a dominatrix dressed as a nun.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.593
Why didn't I start here this morning?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.511
We put it all on red.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.892
And lost.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.562
That sucks. Then what?

14:56.645 --> 15:00.190
Then we had to recoup it
from our own savings that Monday.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.029
-That's it?
-"That's it?"

15:05.112 --> 15:10.159
-We gambled and lost the Santoses' money.
-And you returned it-- It was a Monday?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.660
Yeah, but we lied.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.913
You know, we were selfish.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.624
If people knew that, are you kidding me?

15:20.044 --> 15:21.211
Okay.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.214
Okay, fine. I slept with her.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.216
I did.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.303
Real rough-style too.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.017
-Can you define "rough style"?
-You know, when...

15:35.976 --> 15:37.978
I'm trying to give you something.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.980
-Got to do better, Gil.
-Fuck!

15:43.067 --> 15:43.901
Fuck.

15:45.569 --> 15:48.405
So I managed to rolling-pin
the only saint in Madre Linda?

15:48.489 --> 15:50.032
Not even the saints are saints.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.786
But, look, I-- I don't know.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.287
My mom's taking Henry tomorrow.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.790
-With everything...
-It's a good idea.

15:57.873 --> 15:59.833
[reporter on TV]
"Committee to Find Natalie Engler"

15:59.917 --> 16:03.087
is organizing a search party in
Redwood State Park, which is Natalie's...

16:03.170 --> 16:04.588
Better give her a frozen one.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.133
In case of an earthquake, right? Or...

16:08.759 --> 16:10.678
we're taken in for questioning.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.347
Joe?

16:15.349 --> 16:18.227
-Tell me not to panic.
-There's nothing for them to find.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.353
What if they do?

16:20.020 --> 16:24.316
What if they get a search warrant
or they start looking around?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.151
"What's in this basement?"

16:26.235 --> 16:29.321
[Joe] Why is it feeling
like this has become my fault?

16:29.405 --> 16:32.408
[boy] It's your fault
your mommy left you here, Goldberg.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.537
We need to get rid of Gil.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.789
We can't have this hanging over our heads.

16:38.872 --> 16:39.707
I know.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.128
Okay, so we built the cage
so that we could stop and think.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.588
What if we've done that and now...?

16:49.258 --> 16:52.761
-What? And now what?
-[boy] What you gonna do, Goldberg?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.180
He's gonna cry.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.766
Just like he cries for his mommy
in bed very night.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.726
[boys laughing]

16:58.809 --> 17:01.186
We didn't want... to do this.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.189
-We did this to protect our family.
-[Sandy] It had to be done.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.568
You were protecting me.
You're a good boy, Joey.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.070
What if the only option is for Gil to--?

17:12.322 --> 17:13.657
[boy] She's not coming for you.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.826
No one is coming to save you.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.578
Yeah.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.581
Give me a better idea.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.209
-I can't believe you're saying this.
-I'm just asking questions.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.878
You're saying, "I don't know."

17:25.961 --> 17:28.297
You hit him and put him in a cage
when we could've--

17:28.380 --> 17:29.923
-Sued him.
-The cage was your idea.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.593
-No, no, no. We are not going to--
-How--?

17:32.676 --> 17:35.971
You are not making me kill anyone!

17:38.724 --> 17:40.768
We are not doing that to our son.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.333
I shouldn't.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.462
Not exactly getting my run in down here.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.718
Used to be my son Alan and I
got out there every morning.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.679
Before he went off to Dartmouth.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.893
-He'd get a kick out of this.
-He would?

18:22.976 --> 18:25.729
Come on. His pops knocked down a peg?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.023
You know...

18:28.941 --> 18:30.692
sons and their fathers.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.736
Yeah, I'm new to it.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.697
You kidding?
This idea that you have to mold them

18:35.781 --> 18:37.991
into a good strong man...

18:38.075 --> 18:39.284
How'd you?

18:40.327 --> 18:41.245
Mm.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.707
I came to realize it's a lot simpler
than I was making it.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.459
Here's what you do as a parent:

18:47.543 --> 18:51.588
You keep them healthy and safe
and be a good person.

18:53.382 --> 18:57.678
That's it. Protect, be good,
get out of the way.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.471
To be honest, I'm jealous.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.890
You have it all ahead of you.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.609
Hey, um...

19:14.278 --> 19:18.115
whatever happens here,
I just hope I get to see them again.

19:23.787 --> 19:28.292
...hoping we can buy another 30 acres
of this wonderful property on the coast

19:28.375 --> 19:31.837
that apparently gets
this great fog Pinot thrives in.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.257
Sweetie, hand me
those fleece-y p.j.'s in case it's cold.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.760
Butt Paste. He's been a bit red lately.
So I'm gonna...

19:41.221 --> 19:43.765
Worried?
If you think this vineyard business

19:43.849 --> 19:46.560
is going to jeopardize the bakery,
it's the opposite.

19:46.643 --> 19:51.315
-This is how empires are born.
-Yeah, it's actually not that. I, um...

19:54.860 --> 19:56.904
Does Dad still have that guy Cy?

19:56.987 --> 20:00.616
Probably has that little snake digging
into me right now.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.700
Why, what's up?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.953
I know it was something.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.122
Oh, it's no big. I just...

20:08.457 --> 20:11.210
I got a weird vibe from the guy
I rent the bakery from.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.630
I wanna make sure he's legit.
I don't want to put in all of this work

20:14.713 --> 20:17.257
just to have the property seized
by the IRS.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.509
I'll get you his number.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.905
I did something you're not gonna
be totally... psyched about.

20:42.157 --> 20:42.991
Try me.

20:45.827 --> 20:46.662
My mom...

20:47.537 --> 20:51.250
gave me a number for a guy
that my dad uses to look into people.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.003
You involved your family?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.674
I didn't tell them anything. Okay?

21:00.592 --> 21:03.971
I contacted him directly.
I didn't tell him why. He's discreet.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.309
-You're mad at me anyway.
-I'm not mad. I'm worried.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.395
I'm worried.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.356
-That we can't deal with this?
-That you'll hate me

21:14.439 --> 21:16.400
if we don't do it the right way.

21:16.483 --> 21:20.070
The look on your face when you said
you thought Henry would be hurt if...

21:23.407 --> 21:24.866
I'm sorry. I--

21:25.951 --> 21:27.035
I scared you.

21:27.869 --> 21:28.704
No.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.456
Joe...

21:32.249 --> 21:33.625
it broke my heart.

21:33.709 --> 21:37.462
I see how hard
you're trying to be a good dad.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.009
You're scared one little move is
gonna magically fuck it all up.

21:42.092 --> 21:46.179
No, I know it's not magic
because I saw it growing up, how--

21:46.930 --> 21:50.934
What kids are exposed to sticks.
Fucks them up for life.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.603
You've been through a lot.
You're not fucked up for life.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.023
I know.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.609
But I don't wanna roll the dice
with Henry.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.695
I-- You know I understand.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.699
I think about it with Forty.
If he'd grown up differently, maybe--

22:08.869 --> 22:09.703
I get it.

22:11.121 --> 22:11.997
I'm just...

22:13.290 --> 22:14.666
trying to fix this.

22:17.836 --> 22:18.670
Hey.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.255
I love you.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.264
[cell phone buzzing]

22:34.353 --> 22:37.939
Hey, Cy.
No, of course I'm not busy. What is it?

22:44.988 --> 22:46.031
Really?

22:47.449 --> 22:49.076
Oh, that's rich.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.871
I cheated to get my son
into Dartmouth? Why?

22:52.954 --> 22:56.041
Alan is a stellar student.
Not the world's best test-taker--

22:56.124 --> 22:59.252
Dartmouth received perfect test scores
from your son.

22:59.336 --> 23:03.673
No. He got in on his GPA,
his essay and community service.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.302
And his perfect SAT score.
And there's also...

23:07.386 --> 23:10.972
Yeah, all-American water polo
until a career-ending injury.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.976
-That isn't my son's transcript.
-No? 'Cause there's also this.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.356
That's 50 K you donated
to a Bennett's Fund

23:19.439 --> 23:22.192
to help underprivileged kids have
a shot at college.

23:22.275 --> 23:25.195
-[Joe] You're good at this.
-What's that got to do with anything?

23:25.278 --> 23:29.699
There is no Bennett's Fund.
Or there is, but for kids like Alan.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.992
[Joe] Disturbingly good.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.078
That's 25,000 to a Frye family

23:33.161 --> 23:36.706
whose all-star cheerleader Vicky
graduated with Alan.

23:36.790 --> 23:40.877
What? Did they agree to vouch
they build houses in Haiti or some shit?

23:45.924 --> 23:47.342
Wait, wait, wait.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.760
-Wait a second.
-What?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.139
You had no idea, did you?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.143
Why...?

23:57.269 --> 23:58.478
Why would my wife--?

24:01.106 --> 24:01.940
Oh, God.

24:02.732 --> 24:03.608
Oh, no.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.068
Alan.

24:05.986 --> 24:06.987
Not again.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.532
He promised he would be good.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.119
[Joe] This is worse
than some college scandal.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.205
Alan did something to this Vicky.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.373
It was a payoff.

24:19.207 --> 24:23.920
His beloved Alan is a very bad young man
who hurts girls.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.591
It was Alan in Ohio, right?

24:28.675 --> 24:30.802
The girl who was attacked...

24:32.053 --> 24:33.305
sexually assaulted.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.557
The reason you left.

24:37.058 --> 24:38.852
And he did it again.

24:40.645 --> 24:44.608
I believed
that it was just a onetime mistake.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.068
I made my mistakes at that age, so I--

24:50.697 --> 24:51.698
I did nothing.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.577
Now another girl got hurt.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.414
I made poor Margaret feel
like she had to do all this.

25:02.834 --> 25:06.046
[Joe] Gil said fatherhood was
just about protecting them

25:06.129 --> 25:07.464
and getting out of the way,

25:07.547 --> 25:11.593
but that's clearly not enough
to keep his son from going wrong.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.721
Which is terrifying
but also exactly what we needed

25:14.804 --> 25:16.556
to get Gil to play ball.

25:16.640 --> 25:21.311
Our next move is to propose
his imminent relocation from Madre Linda.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.357
Too bad for Ellie, my boss busted me,
so this book's back to the library.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.650
I'll try again.

25:26.733 --> 25:30.111
Now, as for Gil,
I wonder if he's marinated long enough.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.282
What? No. No, no, no.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.784
[shouting]

25:39.746 --> 25:40.997
Oh, my God!

25:43.250 --> 25:44.501
Get it off. Get it off him.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.586
-Get it off him!
-I'm trying!

25:47.712 --> 25:49.464
I'm trying. I'm trying.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.509
[Love speaking indistinctly]

25:55.387 --> 25:57.931
[Love]
Joe, we can't just sit here all night.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.976
I-- I need you to talk to me.

26:02.602 --> 26:06.898
We need to do something about this.
We need to come up with some plan.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.485
Joe, I really need you to listen to me.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.112
Joe.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.240
Joseph Quinn-Goldberg!

26:16.491 --> 26:17.492
Hey.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.411
This is not our fault.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.247
He did this.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.083
It was his decision.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.211
We did everything to keep our promise.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.880
Why the fuck did he have to...

26:31.840 --> 26:33.717
kill himself? Oh, my God.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.094
He's already ruined his family.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.345
[cell phone buzzes]

26:40.348 --> 26:41.474
Fuck.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.898
The search is starting soon.

26:49.816 --> 26:51.776
Okay, okay.

26:52.902 --> 26:55.071
I will make an appearance for us.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.951
And then I will be back
as soon as I can. Okay?

27:00.035 --> 27:00.952
Okay.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.705
Okay, okay, okay.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.375
Oh, my God.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.085
Joe.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.963
I have a plan.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.716
Hi, can you guys hear me okay? Hi.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.886
Okay. Fine.

27:59.969 --> 28:02.472
Thank you all for showing up.

28:02.555 --> 28:06.810
If I may say on behalf
of Natalie's beautiful family,

28:06.893 --> 28:08.645
we are so grateful

28:08.728 --> 28:11.773
to each and every one of you.

28:11.856 --> 28:15.443
Natalie is a fixture of Madre Linda.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.071
We need her,

28:18.154 --> 28:20.281
and now she needs us.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.201
[sobbing] So good luck out there and--

Sorry.

[crowd applauding]

28:51.730 --> 28:56.401
[Joe] The story you came up with, Love,
is fit for a steamy psychodrama.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.821
Gil Brigham,
Madre Linda's answer to Ned Flanders,

28:59.904 --> 29:00.989
had a secret.

29:01.906 --> 29:05.618
But it was when you used
the phrase "two birds, one stone"

29:05.702 --> 29:08.413
that I saw your true brilliance.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.293
Two bodies, one story,
if we get this part right.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.754
And we will. I will.

29:15.837 --> 29:16.880
I have to.

29:16.963 --> 29:20.008
It's on me to protect you and Henry.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.135
There's no one else who will.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.847
Here are your flags. Drop them as you go.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.153
Hi, Matthew.

29:40.987 --> 29:41.821
Hello.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.909
-How are you holding up?
-Hmm.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.536
I never really know
how to answer that question

29:48.620 --> 29:50.872
when I'm out searching for my wife.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.960
It's your-- I'm sorry. I was just--
I just wanted to know...

29:57.378 --> 29:59.088
I'm sorry this is happening.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.382
I really am.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.510
Well, I guess I have you to thank.

30:05.386 --> 30:08.556
For getting Theodore to come.
He told me you talked to him.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.519
-He called you a kind person.
-I barely said anything. I just...

30:13.645 --> 30:15.146
He seems like a good kid.

30:18.024 --> 30:18.900
Excuse me.

30:30.620 --> 30:34.624
Yo, why is everyone so scared
of Sherry Conrad?

30:35.250 --> 30:39.838
She is fucking pathetic, right?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.716
I hear that her husband,

30:43.800 --> 30:47.804
he has to take pharmaceutical molly
just so he can get it up for her.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.305
Yeah.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.893
Oh, and please tell me
you saw that speech, right?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.065
I have to pee. Be right back.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.027
Okay.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.656
[dramatic music playing]

31:39.814 --> 31:41.941
Awful, you know?

31:42.025 --> 31:45.403
But if I was married
to a robot like Matthew Engler,

31:45.486 --> 31:47.030
probably disappear too.

31:47.113 --> 31:47.947
[all laughing]

31:48.031 --> 31:50.700
-Did you forget your bullhorn, Sherry?
-Theo!

31:50.783 --> 31:53.244
If you have a theory,
make sure everyone hears it.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.038
Everyone knows what you're doing.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.457
You're trying to cash in
on someone else's tragedy,

31:57.540 --> 32:00.001
-so you can sell your vegan panties--
-Hey! Theo!

32:00.084 --> 32:01.878
And get all these likes on Instagram.

Count to ten, okay? Relax.

[thunder rumbling]

32:06.341 --> 32:07.884
Hey, Sherry, are you okay?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.764
He's having a very hard day.
He doesn't mean it.

32:12.847 --> 32:13.848
Right, Theo?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.602
You've done so much.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.521
How about we just get back to it?

32:21.397 --> 32:23.107
-Thank you.
-Of course.

32:24.108 --> 32:24.984
Let's go.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.200
-So that happened.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.778
No idea why they did this to you?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.154
It doesn't matter.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.907
Counselors say I'm a lost cause.
I heard them.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.325
Hey, no, no.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.703
No kid is a lost cause.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.080
Especially not you.

33:24.752 --> 33:28.423
You know, if I were to adopt,
I would want an older kid.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.760
You know why?
Because... you know who they are.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.055
The whole messy truth.

33:37.265 --> 33:39.767
And that's beautiful and worthwhile.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.895
And exactly what I would want in my life.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.899
No matter what happened in the past,

33:48.526 --> 33:51.988
someone out there will want you too.
You're a good kid.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.327
You know, it is really hard to stay mad

34:39.410 --> 34:42.371
at the one person
that I can actually stand talking to.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.791
Hmm. Stepdad still a brick wall?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.795
He's got a lot going on.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.595
But he's not a murderer.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.976
Hey, how did you deal with it?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.061
Like...

35:05.645 --> 35:08.231
all the attention and the rubbernecking?

35:08.314 --> 35:10.566
-You mean, about my brother?
-Yeah.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.862
-I read the Vanity Fair article, so...
-Mm-hm.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.866
He insisted that I cut his hair because
I was the only one that did it right.

35:19.450 --> 35:22.245
And he loved the Ninja Turtle movie.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.915
Uh, he always wanted to fast-forward
where the red one got hurt

35:25.998 --> 35:27.667
because it made him too sad.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.212
The shit that doesn't sell magazines.

35:33.005 --> 35:35.925
The part where he was
a whole fucking human being.

The big,

35:39.762 --> 35:41.931
beautiful, sensitive fucking heart.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.725
He was the only person
who ever really knew me.

You know...

35:49.689 --> 35:50.606
publicity...

35:51.899 --> 35:53.985
it has a way of flattening.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.988
Flattening you
and the people you love into types.

35:57.071 --> 36:01.159
And it's really hard because nobody
will ever let you forget what happened.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.161
Yeah.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.595
Rain snuck up on us.

If it clears up soon,
we'll send people back out.

36:23.014 --> 36:26.350
You can be honest.
Today accomplished absolutely nothing.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.519
Besides something exciting
for the social media feeds

36:28.603 --> 36:30.771
of people that barely knew my wife.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.608
The search was always a long shot,

36:33.691 --> 36:36.485
and you had no belief whatsoever
we'd find anything. None.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.739
I've seen everything
up to this point, okay?

36:39.822 --> 36:42.116
And, yes, usually, you're right.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.077
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.581
I mean, if we did find something...

36:48.664 --> 36:52.752
It would probably be something
that indicated she's not alive anymore.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.341
I know this is hard.

36:59.425 --> 37:02.261

let us keep working.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.493
my heart aches as I write this.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.787
[Gil] You stood by me in spite of my flaws

37:27.870 --> 37:30.539
and Lord knows you don't deserve
what I've done to you.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.084
I strayed. No excuse.

37:33.167 --> 37:37.046
Idiot me thought Natalie could
provide something I was missing.

37:37.129 --> 37:40.716
When it became clear
she'd never belong exclusively to me,

37:40.800 --> 37:42.051
I lost control.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.804
I do not know what came over me.

37:44.887 --> 37:49.642
Next thing I knew, I was standing there,
with an ax, her body on the ground.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.852
And when I put her in the ocean,

37:52.561 --> 37:55.106
I felt like I was possessed
by someone else.

37:55.815 --> 37:59.443
But I am guilty all the same,
and I can't live with what I've done.

38:00.194 --> 38:03.656
I'm sorry I hurt you.
And I'm sorry you found me like this.

38:03.739 --> 38:06.867
I failed all of you. But especially Alan.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.955
Didn't want to see in him
what I saw in myself.

38:11.038 --> 38:13.499
Maybe you can mold him into a better man.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.377
Tell him and the girls I love them.

38:18.629 --> 38:23.050
And know that I love you, Megy.

38:24.218 --> 38:25.928
More than you'll ever know.

38:27.930 --> 38:28.848
[Joe] Forgive me,

38:31.183 --> 38:32.518
Your Gily.

38:34.020 --> 38:38.899
Yeah, well, someone wrote a think piece
about my parents' divorce.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.276
Yeah.

38:40.359 --> 38:43.070
It was about the first wives
of tech superstars

38:43.154 --> 38:45.948
and how Silicon Valley discards women.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.412
Thought that was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

38:51.495 --> 38:55.041
Yeah, look at you now.
Got a family tragedy all your own.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.421
I'm not trying to sound flip. It's just--

39:02.298 --> 39:04.592
-Welcome to the club.
-Mm. Do I get a gift bag?

39:05.760 --> 39:10.848
Or does terrible family tragedy
make people more fuckable?

39:11.390 --> 39:14.685
'Cause... Could really use
a silver lining.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.020
Um...

39:16.896 --> 39:19.357
In my experience, yes, but...

39:20.191 --> 39:22.818
you end up resenting
the people who think that fucking you

39:22.902 --> 39:25.738
was somehow gonna make them
more interesting.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.449
Like it's gonna rub off on them
or something.

Don't let people like that define you.

You just do.

-Don't do that.
-Yep.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.499
Oh, shit. I got a text from my dad.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.459
Whoa. They think they found something.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.630
They think they might have just found
a murder weapon.

I'm Detective Falco
with the Madre Linda Police Department.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.608
There's been a development
in the Natalie Engler investigation.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.862
New evidence points to a suspect
in her disappearance

40:47.945 --> 40:50.990
-and potentially her murder.
-[Joe] We are hardly criminal masterminds.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.032
Gily?

40:53.701 --> 40:55.286
I got your text, honey.

40:55.369 --> 40:58.456
I don't know why you insisted
on the kids staying with my mother.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.835
[Joe] But sometimes
all it takes is a good story.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.547
Make it solid, sexy, relatable.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.553
Give them just enough evidence.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.930
[reporter] It has come to our attention
that Mrs. Engler

41:15.014 --> 41:16.849
was involved
in an extramarital relationship

41:16.932 --> 41:19.185
with Madre Linda resident Gil Brigham,

41:19.268 --> 41:21.604
a professor at Stanford University.

41:22.188 --> 41:26.025
In a letter, Mr. Brigham confessed
he murdered Mrs. Engler and disposed...

41:26.108 --> 41:31.113
[Joe] And the town of Madre Linda settles
into begrudging acceptance

41:31.197 --> 41:34.533
that the sordid tale
of suburban ennui, sex and murder

41:34.617 --> 41:36.160
has come to an end

41:36.243 --> 41:40.164
'cause, well, what bored suburbanite
isn't gonna buy that?

We did it, Love.

Let's be honest,
rebuilding the cage was crazy.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.098
Could've really backfired.
And yet it worked.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.100
We slowed down.

Reflected.

42:02.436 --> 42:03.687
Responded.

42:04.772 --> 42:07.775
Proved we're a team. For Henry.

on every aisle, in Braille.

Weird to think disclosing
one's shit childhood could do that.

Hers must not have been
exactly roses either.

She's with her dad these days.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.666
[Joe] And she throws that away. Curious.

43:05.749 --> 43:08.168
Guess I don't need to ask if you've heard

43:08.252 --> 43:12.131
about the whole awful Gil Brigham thing.

43:12.214 --> 43:14.550
Yeah. Yeah, it's terrible.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.467
Truly.

43:16.885 --> 43:18.721
Does mean we need a new reader.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.806
-You still interested?
-Sure.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.933
-Of course.
-Great.

43:23.017 --> 43:26.145
Oh, and I have a new rec for you.

43:27.855 --> 43:28.939
David Copperfield.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.734
You know, hardscrabble orphan
down on his luck.

43:31.817 --> 43:33.444
Figured you could relate.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.237
[Joe] She's teasing me, isn't she?

43:35.321 --> 43:38.616
-Ha.
-Anyway, if you wanted to apply

43:38.699 --> 43:42.077
your wizard-level book repair skills,
have at it.

43:42.786 --> 43:47.041
[Joe] It's almost like
you're flirting with me?

43:47.124 --> 43:50.002
No. No, you wouldn't.
Well, not consciously.

43:51.086 --> 43:54.423
This necklace thing, nervous habit?

43:54.506 --> 43:59.303
Why would you be nervous unless...?
It couldn't be about me. Could it?

43:59.386 --> 44:00.721
You okay there, Joe?

44:00.804 --> 44:03.599
[Joe] Oh, shit. What was I just doing?

44:03.682 --> 44:05.893
-I'm totally fine.
-Great.

44:06.810 --> 44:09.480
[Joe] I cannot be thinking
about you like this. No.

44:13.525 --> 44:16.111
No, no, no. This is bad.

44:21.116 --> 44:22.493
