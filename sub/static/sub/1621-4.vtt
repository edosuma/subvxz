WEBVTT

02:00.913 --> 02:03.164
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.583
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.460
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.630
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.

02:10.714 --> 02:14.383
Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.969
If he ever gets out.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.596
Loras Tyrell?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.808
Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.644
I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of them.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.979
How good could he be?

02:27.064 --> 02:31.234
He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,
and Renly ain't dead.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.870
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.497
They're horses.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.166
They get spooked by their own shadows.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.839
Do you hear that?

02:54.383 --> 02:55.716
No.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.803
There's something out there.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.869
Oh.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.872
Oh, you're a right little prick.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.498
You should see your face.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.625
I swear you pissed yourself.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.711
"Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

03:32.963 --> 03:34.046
There is something out there.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.215
Yeah, don't even try me.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.801
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.470
Rennick!

03:48.103 --> 03:51.480
- King in the North!
- The King in the North!

04:12.336 --> 04:14.378
Five Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.255
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.007
We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.927
Barely enough food to feed our own.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.929
We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.597
Of course, Your Grace.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.183
The officers will be useful.

04:27.476 --> 04:30.269
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.354
I doubt it.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.981
Well, we'll learn soon enough.

04:34.358 --> 04:38.152
In my family, we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.029
"A flayed man none."

04:40.113 --> 04:42.114
My father outlawed flaying in the North.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.326
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.328
The high road's very pretty,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.121
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.959
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.087
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.632
No, don't! Don't! Please!

05:04.388 --> 05:06.430
The rot's set in.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.391
No, don't! No, don't!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.644
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

05:11.728 --> 05:13.604
It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.565
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now...

05:16.692 --> 05:18.442
No, you can't!

05:21.863 --> 05:23.739
Ser! Please, ser.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.324
- I can't lose...
- You'll die if she doesn't.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.326
I don't want to be a cripple, please.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.246
Surely one of our men
needs your attention more than this cub.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.707
Your men are not my men, my lord.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.334
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.920
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.214
It's better than biting your own tongue,
believe me.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.293
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.336
Your last name?

06:19.463 --> 06:21.714
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.716
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.427
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.013
They killed my father.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.932
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.769
Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?

06:35.312 --> 06:37.688
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.816
He probably never held a spear before they
shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.902
I have no hatred for the lad.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.322
That should help his foot grow back.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.370
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.415
I understand. The country would be at peace

06:56.500 --> 06:59.835
and life would be just under
the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.713
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the gods give me strength.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.007
- And then what?
- I don't know.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.260
We'll go back to Winterfell.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.970
I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.681
So who will?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.642
I don't know.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.936
You're fighting to overthrow a king,

07:17.020 --> 07:18.395
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

07:18.814 --> 07:20.856
First we have to win the war.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.656
You never told me where you're from.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.700
- Volantis.
- Volantis? You're far from home.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.788
The boy was lucky you were here.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.082
He was unlucky that you were.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.844
You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.887
Your Grace,

07:51.972 --> 07:55.141
whatever my traitor brother has done,
I had no part.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.642
You know that. I beg you, please...

07:56.726 --> 07:58.477
Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.229
Using some vile sorcery,

08:00.313 --> 08:03.274
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.277
Thousands of good men were butchered.

08:06.361 --> 08:10.531
After the slaughter,
the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.202
Killing you
would send your brother a message.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.250
But my mother insists on keeping you alive.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.918
Stand.

08:24.671 --> 08:28.132
So we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.343
Meryn.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.683
Leave her face. I like her pretty.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.402
Meryn, my lady is overdressed.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.779
Unburden her.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.748
If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.543
What is the meaning of this?

09:13.595 --> 09:15.846
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

09:15.931 --> 09:18.057
The kind who serves his king, lmp.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.310
Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
all over your pretty white cloak.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.230
Someone get the girl
something to cover herself with.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.649
She is to be your queen.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.400
Have you no regard for her honor?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.736
- I'm punishing her.
- For what crimes?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.988
She did not fight her brother's battle,
you half-wit.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.824
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

09:36.493 --> 09:38.661
The Mad King did as he liked.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.789
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you
what happened to him?

09:41.957 --> 09:44.792
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.504
I'm not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.674
Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks,
kill him.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.053
That was a threat. See the difference?

10:18.368 --> 10:21.036
I apologize for my nephew's behavior.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.583
Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?

10:26.668 --> 10:29.878
I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.

10:33.883 --> 10:38.220
Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.727
The little king's backed up.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.479
Clogged from balls to brains.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.774
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.235
There's no cure for being a cunt.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.988
But the boy's at that age.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.658
And he's got nothing to do all day
but pick wings off flies.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.411
Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.879
What are you doing here, dog?

11:11.963 --> 11:16.425
Your uncle left your nameday present
and asked me to see that you got it.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.929
And?

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
What is it?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.976
Look inside, Your Grace.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.650
Your Grace.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.613
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.115
We won't tell if you won't.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.120
No.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.831
Her.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.752
Touch her.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.025
Could you hit her?

12:28.665 --> 12:30.165
My uncle sent you?

12:30.792 --> 12:33.669
Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.295
Hmm.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.181
Use this.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.654
Harder.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.537
I said harder.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.001
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

13:56.961 --> 14:00.088
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.766
Please, Your Grace.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.520
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...

14:14.604 --> 14:16.563
Oh, I want him to find out.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.400
You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished

14:20.485 --> 14:22.236
and show him what you've done,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.448
or the same thing will happen to you.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.540
Begin.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.675
Harder!

14:55.979 --> 14:58.981
Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.776
Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.738
Your Grace.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.203
Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
is that it?

15:13.705 --> 15:18.667
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.836
I'm a practical man.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.506
Just not a loyal one.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.258
And who would you have me be loyal to?

15:26.718 --> 15:28.218
Your brother's corpse?

15:31.055 --> 15:33.348
I don't like you, Lord Baelish.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.393
I don't like your face.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.229
I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.150
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.652
So tell me, why are you here?

15:47.697 --> 15:51.199
You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.997
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

15:57.081 --> 16:01.918
many who believe Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.547
Now I understand.

16:06.716 --> 16:11.094
You know I have the numbers.
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.890
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.060
And your head.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.103
I would give priority to my head.

16:21.439 --> 16:25.859
I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.487
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.157
When you march on King's Landing,

16:32.241 --> 16:35.369
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

16:37.121 --> 16:38.580
open gates.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.433
Your Grace.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.976
Lord Baelish.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.564
All of these tents look the same to me.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.983
- Would you be so kind...
- It would be my pleasure.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.444
It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.948
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

17:13.031 --> 17:17.077
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
we're on the move again.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.787
"Your tent"?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.789
Not "Our tent"?

17:22.040 --> 17:25.961
The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?

17:27.130 --> 17:29.715
Pressures of command, no doubt.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.134
Four kings vying for the throne.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.386
I am not tutored in warfare,

17:34.470 --> 17:38.306
but basic arithmetic
favors the side with the greater numbers.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.310
If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.523
I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent just now.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.734
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the king's side.

17:48.818 --> 17:53.113
And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.574
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.243
Your marriage is quite interesting.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.121
Not only to me, but to the realm.

18:01.497 --> 18:06.501
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest, if nothing else.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.587
You've never married, have you?

18:09.547 --> 18:13.008
I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.927
That is sad.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.429
Though perhaps it's for the best.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.514
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

18:19.974 --> 18:21.516
so allow me to explain.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.103
My husband is my king,
and my king is my husband.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.691
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.351
This isn't your horse.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.314
It was given to me by the Thirteen.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.899
The Elders of Qarth.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.275
Qarth?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.862
Three days to the east, on the sea.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.073
Will they let us in?

19:18.241 --> 19:21.952
They said they would be honored
to receive the Mother of Dragons.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.207
What do you know of this place?

19:27.708 --> 19:31.336
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.633
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

19:36.717 --> 19:38.260
the garden grows.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.567
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.784
Bring her about!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.120
What kind of fire melts stone?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.331
Dragon fire.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.083
There's dragons here?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.711
No, all the dragons are dead.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.796
What's that smell?

20:17.008 --> 20:18.466
Dead people.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.510
Move.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.105
Please, please, no, no!

20:39.572 --> 20:40.822
No.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.876
He's dead.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.880
He was my son.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.676
My sister was three days ago.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.513
My husband, the day before that.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.100
They take someone every day?

21:11.354 --> 21:13.021
Does anyone live?

21:36.879 --> 21:38.088
Joffrey.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.507
Cersei.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.759
Ilyn Payne.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.552
The Hound.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.388
Joffrey.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.932
Cersei.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.601
Ilyn Payne.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.436
The Hound.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.231
Joffrey. Cersei.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.900
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.615
How dare you?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.701
You may have heard false reports.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.995
- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.871
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.748
I begged him to seize the moment.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.210
I trusted you. My husband trusted you.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.089
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.298
- No, my lady.
- Get out!

22:22.425 --> 22:23.800
Cat, I've...

22:25.094 --> 22:27.137
I've loved you since I was a boy.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.224
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance...

22:31.392 --> 22:33.977
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

22:48.451 --> 22:50.118
Do you want to see your girls again?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.623
Sansa, more beautiful than ever?

22:56.417 --> 22:59.753
And Arya, just as wild as ever?

23:01.088 --> 23:02.464
You have Arya, too?

23:02.715 --> 23:06.468
Both girls are healthy and safe.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.054
For now.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.932
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

23:14.226 --> 23:18.146
I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.628
What do you want?

23:43.714 --> 23:46.257
The Lannisters will trade your daughters
for the Kingslayer.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.093
Of course they will.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.553
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

23:51.180 --> 23:52.889
Robb will never agree to those terms.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.141
I'm not bringing these terms to him.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.518
I'm bringing them to you.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.270
You think I keep secrets from my son?

23:59.355 --> 24:02.023
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

24:02.108 --> 24:03.149
but he's not a mother.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.027
Consider it, Cat.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.906
You may not get another chance.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.830
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.707
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

24:20.417 --> 24:24.045
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

24:24.964 --> 24:26.297
is offered in good faith.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.715
Good faith?

24:32.805 --> 24:33.972
What's this?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.795
Your husband was an honorable man.

25:07.131 --> 25:10.300
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.432
- You may not believe...
- Get out.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.133
Get up, you dogs!

26:03.646 --> 26:05.688
That's him, the one who picks.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.650
The Mountain.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.404
What are you doing?

26:13.989 --> 26:16.115
He told me he stares at him every day.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.159
That's why he doesn't get picked.

26:43.769 --> 26:44.852
You.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.522
Move, boy!

26:48.274 --> 26:49.357
Move!

27:09.545 --> 27:11.462
Is there gold and silver
in the village?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.464
- I don't know.
- Gems?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.175
I didn't see any.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.303
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.113
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.116
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.790
Which of the villagers aided them?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.584
- I don't know.
- Who?

27:50.044 --> 27:51.085
I...

27:55.382 --> 27:59.260
- Who?
- I never saw.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.680
Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to...

28:02.765 --> 28:05.016
- Who?
- I didn't see anyone help him.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.269
Take it off! Take it off!

28:08.354 --> 28:10.813
- Who helped him?
- Ganes, the butcher,

28:10.898 --> 28:12.565
- and his son.
- That's better.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.693
- You've been very helpful.
- No, stop, please!

28:15.986 --> 28:18.279
What are you doing? Please, stop!

28:18.364 --> 28:20.656
Please, stop! No! No!

28:20.991 --> 28:23.117
I told you everything! No!

28:23.285 --> 28:25.161
No!

28:27.331 --> 28:28.581
Joffrey.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.334
Cersei.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.337
Ilyn Payne. The Hound.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.006
Please, Polliver. Some food.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.550
Just a crust of bread.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.264
Polliver.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.642
The Mountain.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.413
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

29:08.622 --> 29:11.499
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.961
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.172
When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.758
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.763
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.349
Why is your stag on fire?

29:29.476 --> 29:33.604
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

29:33.689 --> 29:37.692
Ah, you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.902
Mmm, brother,

29:40.654 --> 29:43.156
now I understand
why you found religion in your old age.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.740
Watch yourself, Renly.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.868
No, no, I'm relieved.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.204
I never really believed you were a fanatic.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.166
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,

29:53.292 --> 29:55.042
but not a godly man.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.837
You should kneel before your brother.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.839
He's the Lord's chosen,

30:00.382 --> 30:02.216
born amidst salt and smoke.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.135
Born amidst salt and smoke?

30:05.345 --> 30:07.722
- Is he a ham?
- That's twice I've warned you.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.640
Listen to yourselves.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.685
If you were sons of mine,
I would knock your heads together

30:12.769 --> 30:16.397
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered that you were brothers.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.108
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.819
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.905
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.033
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.659
We share a common enemy.

30:28.911 --> 30:31.579
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.749
All those that deny that are my foes.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.337
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.172
Old men deny it with their death rattle

30:41.256 --> 30:43.633
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.179
No one wants you for their king.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.140
You never wanted any friends, brother.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.559
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

30:54.853 --> 30:59.774
For the sake of the mother who bore us,
I will give you this one night to reconsider.

31:00.776 --> 31:04.362
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

31:05.072 --> 31:08.282
and I will grant you
your old seat in the Council.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.285
I'll even name you my heir

31:12.454 --> 31:13.621
until a son is born to me.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.959
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.673
Look across those fields, brother.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.551
Can you see all those banners?

31:26.635 --> 31:29.053
You think a few bolts of cloth
will make you king?

31:29.137 --> 31:30.179
No.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.392
The men holding those bolts of cloth
will make me king.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.561
We shall see, Renly.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.813
Come the dawn, we shall see.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.482
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.651
The night is dark and full of terrors.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.660
Would you believe I loved him once?

32:13.515 --> 32:15.516
I thought we were welcome.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.185
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.104
you might do the same, Khaleesi.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.858
Horde?

32:39.625 --> 32:41.626
My name is Daenerys...

32:41.710 --> 32:44.545
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.756
You know me, my lord?

32:46.840 --> 32:48.966
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.428
And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.891
They call you the Mother of Dragons.

32:57.059 --> 32:58.643
And what should I call you?

32:59.227 --> 33:00.353
Oh, my name is quite long

33:00.437 --> 33:03.105
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

33:03.357 --> 33:06.192
I am simply a trader of spices.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.612
But we are the Thirteen,

33:10.322 --> 33:13.616
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

33:13.742 --> 33:16.827
the greatest city that ever was or will be.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.749
- The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
- Qarth.

33:24.628 --> 33:25.795
Qarth.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.422
Might we see the dragons?

33:33.970 --> 33:36.347
My friend,

33:37.599 --> 33:39.600
we have traveled very far.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.894
We have no food, no water.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.647
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored...

33:44.773 --> 33:47.108
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

33:47.943 --> 33:50.945
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

33:51.947 --> 33:53.823
Some of my more skeptical friends

33:53.907 --> 33:57.118
refuse to believe your children

33:57.828 --> 33:59.203
even exist.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.289
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.625
I am not a liar.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.752
Oh, I don't think you are.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.337
But as I've never met you before,

34:08.422 --> 34:11.005
my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.969
Where I come from,

34:15.971 --> 34:20.975
guests are treated with respect,
not insulted at the gates.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.353
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.063
We wish you well.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.735
What are you doing?

34:31.987 --> 34:34.155
You promised to receive me.

34:35.614 --> 34:36.991
We have received you.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.326
Here we are, and here you are.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.539
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.000
Which we shall deeply regret.

34:46.626 --> 34:49.587
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that ever was or will be

34:49.670 --> 34:52.922
by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.433
Khaleesi, please be careful.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.353
Thirteen!

35:08.106 --> 35:13.527
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me

35:13.695 --> 35:15.821
and destroy those who have wronged me.

35:15.906 --> 35:20.493
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.914
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.792
Ah.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.211
You are a true Targaryen.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.255
Only, as you said a moment ago,

35:33.340 --> 35:35.758
if we don't let you into the city,
you will all die.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.551
And so...

35:37.636 --> 35:42.431
Retreating in fear from a little girl
is unbecoming of the greatest city

35:42.516 --> 35:43.974
that ever was or will be.

35:44.226 --> 35:47.645
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.480
The Thirteen have spoken.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.732
I am one of the Thirteen,

35:52.567 --> 35:53.901
and I am still speaking.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.238
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

35:57.322 --> 36:00.241
and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.576
She is the Mother of Dragons.

36:02.994 --> 36:07.915
Do you expect her to watch her people starve
without breathing fire?

36:08.291 --> 36:10.709
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki

36:10.794 --> 36:13.337
through our gates without dooming our city.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.464
After all, here I am,

36:16.591 --> 36:20.427
a savage from the Summer lsles,
and Qarth still stands.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.013
Our decision is final.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.266
Very well.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.854
I invoke soumai.

36:34.734 --> 36:39.947
I will vouch for her, her people,
and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.289
Be it on your head.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.459
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

37:42.344 --> 37:43.427
You.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.648
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

37:55.732 --> 37:59.109
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

37:59.861 --> 38:00.903
I don't know what that is.

38:30.350 --> 38:34.395
You two.
Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.271
What's this?

38:36.356 --> 38:39.650
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.735
Evidently not.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.489
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

38:45.573 --> 38:47.908
Cells are overflowing, my lord.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.120
This lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.999
After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...

38:55.625 --> 38:59.837
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

38:59.921 --> 39:02.006
able young bodies and skilled laborers?

39:11.975 --> 39:14.268
You, do you have a trade?

39:15.937 --> 39:17.104
Smith, my lord.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.941
What are you looking at? Kneel!

39:22.819 --> 39:25.779
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.157
He'll do no such thing.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.493
This one's a girl, you idiot,

39:32.454 --> 39:33.620
dressed as a boy.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.457
- Why?
- Safer to travel, my lord.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.542
Smart.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.586
More than I can say for this lot.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.630
Get these prisoners to work.

39:43.923 --> 39:44.965
Bring the girl.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.426
I need a new cupbearer.

39:47.761 --> 39:48.969
My lord.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.479
Your visits are too few, cousin.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.064
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,

40:00.148 --> 40:02.524
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.985
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.155
Will you take a cup with me?

40:08.448 --> 40:11.158
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

40:11.284 --> 40:14.495
I am here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, lmp.

40:15.497 --> 40:18.332
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.000
I would have thought she'd come herself.

40:20.502 --> 40:23.587
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.422
I don't care what you make of it,

40:25.507 --> 40:28.175
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

40:28.259 --> 40:32.012
And you've received
these instructions directly from Cersei?

40:32.472 --> 40:34.306
As I said several times.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.184
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

40:38.019 --> 40:40.604
When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
I carry it out without delay.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.360
Cersei must have great trust in you,

40:47.403 --> 40:51.031
allowing you into her chamber
during the hour of the wolf.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.330
The Queen Regent has
a great many responsibilities.

40:58.414 --> 40:59.915
She often works from dusk till dawn.

40:59.999 --> 41:04.211
She must be very glad to have you helping her
from dusk till dawn.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.964
Ah.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.173
Lavender oil.

41:08.258 --> 41:10.676
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.261
I am a knight!

41:12.971 --> 41:14.930
An anointed knight, yes.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.893
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

41:21.563 --> 41:23.564
What? Nothing to say?

41:24.232 --> 41:25.774
No more warnings for me, ser?

41:25.859 --> 41:27.568
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.238
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

41:31.322 --> 41:34.408
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

41:38.705 --> 41:39.997
It's not my fault!

41:40.081 --> 41:42.666
Did she take you against your will?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.751
Can you not defend yourself, knight?

41:44.836 --> 41:48.088
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

41:48.256 --> 41:50.215
he told me to obey her in everything.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.176
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

41:52.260 --> 41:55.262
I only meant I did as I was bid.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.014
Hated every moment of it,

41:57.098 --> 41:58.849
is that what you'll have me believe?

41:59.267 --> 42:01.185
A high place in court, a knighthood,

42:01.269 --> 42:03.520
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.772
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.774
Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.904
- Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
- Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.573
My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
the Queen.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.366
I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.620
- No, I think not.
- My lord?

42:20.330 --> 42:21.496
You heard me.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.629
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.

42:28.755 --> 42:31.381
Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.967
Pleasure her whenever she requires.

42:34.052 --> 42:38.513
No one ever need know,
as long as you keep faith with me.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.726
I want to know what Cersei is doing,

42:43.144 --> 42:47.731
where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.150
And you will tell me.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.653
Yes, my lord, I will.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.738
I swear it, as you command.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.160
Oh, rise, rise.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.622
Let us drink to our understanding.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.250
Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.

43:06.876 --> 43:11.046
Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
and it's all for the good of the realm.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.632
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

43:13.716 --> 43:15.759
that I want no more conflict between us

43:15.843 --> 43:19.471
and that, henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.806
But her demands?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.475
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.186
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

43:26.271 --> 43:29.815
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
but I will not have him on the Council.

43:30.191 --> 43:32.734
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

43:32.819 --> 43:36.029
but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.

43:47.125 --> 43:50.127
Stay within one table length.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.717
Your Grace.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.558
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?

44:07.437 --> 44:10.731
Well, life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.941
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

44:13.026 --> 44:14.943
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

44:16.279 --> 44:18.196
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.867
Never understood why you had to wear them.

44:22.327 --> 44:25.746
It reminds me of where I come from
and where I am now.

44:26.247 --> 44:27.789
It reminds me of yourjustice.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.542
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.919
You were a hero and a smuggler.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.592
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad the good.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.471
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

44:42.555 --> 44:44.639
- Does he listen?
- To me?

44:44.724 --> 44:45.974
Gods, no.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.936
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest...

44:50.188 --> 44:51.730
She has a name.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.986
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.157
I've lived within the law for 17...

45:02.241 --> 45:04.451
I want you to be a smuggler this time.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.037
Any shore, any night.

45:07.663 --> 45:08.997
What am I bringing ashore?

45:09.082 --> 45:10.582
The red woman.

45:12.627 --> 45:16.296
No one must know what you do
and we'll not speak of this again.

45:16.381 --> 45:19.466
I am true to Your Grace and always will be,

45:20.468 --> 45:22.677
but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.472
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.504
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

46:00.716 --> 46:04.094
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.557
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.564
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

46:15.690 --> 46:19.025
I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
good and bad.

46:19.694 --> 46:22.821
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

46:23.948 --> 46:26.199
A man is good or he is evil.

46:26.367 --> 46:28.160
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

46:29.370 --> 46:34.374
I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
a champion of light and life.

46:35.835 --> 46:38.170
Well, that must be very nice for you.

46:54.479 --> 46:57.439
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

46:58.316 --> 47:00.358
Yet you have known other women.

47:00.443 --> 47:02.194
Don't talk about my wife.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.946
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

47:06.616 --> 47:08.366
Like me, Ser Davos.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.498
You want me.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.501
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.713
And you will.

47:26.344 --> 47:31.056
Strange that this Lord of Light
asks you to work in the shadows.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.435
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.

47:35.770 --> 47:39.606
They are servants of light, the children of fire.

47:40.608 --> 47:43.944
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

47:44.028 --> 47:46.571
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

47:48.157 --> 47:50.408
They can't bar our passage.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.165
Gods protect us.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.876
There's only one god, Ser Davos,

48:01.254 --> 48:03.547
and he only protects those who serve him.
