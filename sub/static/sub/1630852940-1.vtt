00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
What now?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.760
<i>Where's the key to your locker?</i>

01:22.840 --> 01:24.800
I have it.
How many times must I tell you?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.040
<i>And the inspection?</i>

01:26.120 --> 01:27.600
<i>It's tense here. Where are you?</i>

01:28.080 --> 01:30.320
I'm almost there.
Quit calling every five minutes.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.440
<i>I don't care.</i>
<i>You deal with Internal Affairs.</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:34.640
<i>I have nothing to do with your schemes.</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:35.600
<i>Is that clear?</i>

01:37.320 --> 01:39.000
How long until they show up?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.320
<i>Whenever they want.</i>
<i>That's kind of the point.</i>

01:42.760 --> 01:43.640
What a pain!

01:43.720 --> 01:45.280
<i>That's kind of the point, too.</i>

01:45.360 --> 01:46.960
<i>So, what do we do, Lieutenant?</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:49.320
Nobody touches my stuff, you got that?

01:55.120 --> 01:56.120
Yes, Agathe?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.040
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

01:58.920 --> 02:00.240
The paperwork's done.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.520
She's in the funeral parlor.
They're placing her in the coffin.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.800
We're waiting for you.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.600
Listen, I had no choice.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
How is Louise?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.480
How do you think she is?

02:13.160 --> 02:14.320
Agathe!

02:15.680 --> 02:18.000
Shit, you're not helping me, little sis.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.200
Where'd you come from?

02:38.760 --> 02:41.120
Come on, move! Move!

02:42.560 --> 02:43.440
Shit!

02:45.400 --> 02:46.800
What a stupid dog!

03:00.600 --> 03:01.480
What was that?

03:07.680 --> 03:08.520
Oh, shit.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.000
Sir, are you all right?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Sir?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.080
Sir?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.120
No…

03:35.920 --> 03:36.880
Shit!

03:48.680 --> 03:50.160
112 EMERGENCY - CALL

03:56.640 --> 03:57.480
Hello?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.400
<i>Daddy?</i>

03:59.400 --> 04:00.320
Louise, sweetie.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.200
<i>Daddy, I'm bored here.</i>

04:02.280 --> 04:03.480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

04:06.400 --> 04:08.240
<i>Daddy? Hello?</i>

04:08.920 --> 04:11.000
<i>-Can you bring me a toy?</i>
-A toy?

04:12.720 --> 04:15.240
Sweetie, ask your aunt, alright? Okay?

04:15.760 --> 04:17.200
<i>Will you be here soon?</i>

04:17.800 --> 04:19.320
Daddy will call you back.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.120
Fuck…

05:20.240 --> 05:21.280
Did you reach Thomas?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.200
-And?
-And nothing.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.280
What do you mean?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.080
He said he wants to do it himself.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.280
Dammit… Did you insist?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.600
How long have you been partners?
Eight? Ten years?

05:32.680 --> 05:33.640
Twelve. So what?

05:33.720 --> 05:36.480
So you must know
how shitty a person he is.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.160
What an idiot!

05:45.120 --> 05:46.880
Dammit! What a pain in the ass!

05:58.000 --> 05:59.080
They're here.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.600
Okay, thank you.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.240
They just drove in.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.480
Listen, I'm not screwing up
my internship for you.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.520
Don't worry.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.720
If IA asks me about Thomas, what do I say?

06:21.440 --> 06:23.280
Nothing. We don't rat out colleagues.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.760
And the police… are one big family.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.240
Got it?

06:33.320 --> 06:34.320
I'm sick of this!

07:33.080 --> 07:34.240
Dammit, what is this?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.360
Dammit!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.760
Yes, I'm going.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.400
No…

08:09.600 --> 08:11.640
National Gendarmerie, good evening, sir.

08:11.720 --> 08:12.720
Good evening.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.080
Watch out.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.160
I can't find it.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.200
-Turn off the engine, sir.
-I told you I'm one of you, it's okay.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.840
-Vehicle inspection, open your trunk.
-This is bull. Please let me go, now.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.480
Exit the vehicle and open your trunk, sir.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.080
You need to stop giving me orders.

08:59.160 --> 09:02.000
-Is there a problem?
-He says he's police but has no badge.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.080
He's also refusing to open his trunk.
His attitude is suspicious.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.920
His car is damaged.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.160
He must've had an accident.
That warrants a breathalyzer test.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.080
Aren't you overreaching a little?

09:12.680 --> 09:13.760
It's okay.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.280
Sorry, chief.
It's just a misunderstanding.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.040
Good evening, sir.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.360
Good evening. I'm Lt. Blin, Crime Squad.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.200
I forgot my badge at the hospital.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.880
At the hospital?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.200
Yes.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.000
My mother died,
and they're placing her in her coffin now.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.120
I'm late, so…
Do me a favor. One cop to another.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.160
I would, sir, but isn't the hospital…

09:39.840 --> 09:41.440
in the other direction?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.600
What is your badge number?

09:48.440 --> 09:51.120
811403. Hey! Don't touch my car, please.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.160
A badge has seven numbers, sir.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.040
I know, this just isn't a good time.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.240
-We're going to verify it. Follow me.
-No. Go ahead, I'll wait here.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.840
I said don't touch my car!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.480
-Calm down!
-What are you doing?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.520
Get him!

10:08.600 --> 10:10.240
-Stop!
-Chief!

10:27.560 --> 10:30.160
So Thomas keeps all his cash
in his locker. Smooth.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.960
Do you know a better hiding spot
than the station?

10:33.440 --> 10:34.920
Well, he's screwed now!

10:35.000 --> 10:37.240
Yes, whatever, just do it. Hurry up.

10:37.320 --> 10:40.680
-Don't mess around! Toss it all!
-What do you think I am?

10:41.560 --> 10:44.040
Not too much at once. We mustn't clog it.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.160
I'm doing my best, okay?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.200
Fuck, it reeks!

10:49.280 --> 10:51.280
-Come on, keep going!
-Okay, I get it!

10:51.360 --> 10:52.320
Fuck.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.600
I'm truly sorry, Lieutenant.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.800
This stays between us.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.560
You can count on me.

11:13.560 --> 11:17.440
MARC - THEY'RE HERE. DON'T COME.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.280
Are you sure
you don't want an escort, Lieutenant?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.640
Three hundred kilos of cannabis.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.480
Hidden in frozen shrimp packages?

11:52.560 --> 11:55.760
Yes. The drugs were hidden
using the rip-off method.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.360
The drugs were loaded
into a legitimate cargo shipment,

11:59.440 --> 12:01.480
unbeknownst to the shipping company,

12:01.560 --> 12:04.080
and received at the port
in refrigerated containers

12:04.160 --> 12:05.840
by accomplices, dock workers.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.800
In Paris, I don't know, but…
Sorry, Commandant,

12:08.880 --> 12:11.120
but everyone here knows what a rip-off is.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.640
In Paris, it's "Madam Commandant."

12:14.840 --> 12:17.080
Are you here to give us a police exam or…?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.320
No, let's just say
I'll be examining your morals.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.840
What's this?

12:28.600 --> 12:30.720
That Internal Security report states

12:30.800 --> 12:33.600
that officers in your unit
are strongly suspected to be

12:33.680 --> 12:35.680
turning a blind eye to those activities.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.400
In exchange for bribes, considerable ones.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.840
Dammit.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.560
Is anyone there?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.360
Daddy, your foot!

13:29.000 --> 13:30.160
You all right, sweetie?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.280
-Yes.
-I'm back. Give me that.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.320
-You all right?
-It's about time.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.320
Where were you?

13:36.400 --> 13:40.040
-Why did you get her a toy like that?
-She's the one who picked it out.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.640
Like father, like daughter.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.680
Why did you leave me all alone?

13:44.440 --> 13:46.160
I'm sorry. But I'm here now.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.600
But they're ready to close the casket.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.920
I'm not going back in. I couldn't bear it.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.440
Well…

14:09.920 --> 14:12.000
Shall we rest a little in the meantime?

14:12.080 --> 14:13.480
Yes, that's a good idea.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.480
Give Daddy a kiss to give him strength.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.440
I want to stay with you.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.080
No, it's better
if you stay with Auntie, okay?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.760
-See you later.
-Wait.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.480
She wanted to be buried with this.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.760
It's important to her.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.680
Alcohol is allowed at the station?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.680
A local custom, perhaps.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.880
A two-hour drive
just to go through my trash?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.960
I'm not sure it justifies
your expense reports.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.360
That's why we're still searching.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.520
Your staff's private cars
are in the parking lot?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.720
-Yes.
-Very well.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.520
Could you take my men there?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.520
-Naomi.
-Yes?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
If you don't mind.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.080
Go ahead.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.320
Excuse me, Madam Commandant,
the alcohol, it's…

15:22.040 --> 15:23.920
This was an exception.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.800
A colleague's mother passed away.
We had a few drinks in her honor.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.280
-That's all.
-You're talking about Lt. Blin?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.360
Yes. So what?

15:34.240 --> 15:36.040
And where is this orphan cop?

15:37.760 --> 15:39.320
At the hospital funeral parlor.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.040
Okay.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.040
You're going to harass him
at a time like this?

16:12.800 --> 16:13.640
Well.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.600
May we proceed
with the closing of the casket?

16:17.520 --> 16:18.440
Okay.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.520
You can put in whatever you wish,
even valuables.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.880
Don't worry, the room
has surveillance cameras

16:26.960 --> 16:28.880
to prevent theft from the deceased.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.200
Gentlemen…

17:10.960 --> 17:13.440
THEY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

17:22.360 --> 17:23.360
Excuse me, sorry.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.520
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING,
EVEN THE CARS.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.280
GOT ANYTHING IN THERE?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.800
Is everything okay?
Would you like to sit down?

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
No. I'll be fine.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
Thank you.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.960
Shit!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.160
Excuse me.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.440
Could I spend
a few more minutes with my mother?

20:08.720 --> 20:09.640
It's just that…

20:10.280 --> 20:12.240
It's already past closing time.

20:13.960 --> 20:14.960
I understand.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.200
Here, for your troubles.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.560
You have until 10:00 p.m.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.080
Thank you.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.880
And what are those for?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.520
For my daughter.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.600
I'm sorry, Mom.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.480
Come on.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.720
Come on!

21:53.840 --> 21:56.320
SIGNAL DISTANCE OF 4 METERS

22:05.840 --> 22:08.480
There. That's good, come on.
Come, that's it.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.560
No!

22:31.320 --> 22:32.480
Come on.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.640
Come on.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.880
Sorry, I'm a bad son.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.280
Is anybody there?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.600
Did you hear that?

24:06.840 --> 24:08.040
I'm not sure.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.280
I'll call security.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.920
Motherfucker!

24:21.880 --> 24:22.840
Yo.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.320
<i>-Security?</i>
-Hmm?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.200
<i>We can't get into Room 1</i>

24:26.280 --> 24:28.360
<i>and there are strange noises.</i>
<i>Could you check?</i>

24:31.640 --> 24:33.520
The video's out. That's weird.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.400
<i>Do you have the key?</i>

24:36.240 --> 24:39.120
Yes, but I can't leave
my post just like that.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.160
I'll tell the manager.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.360
So, what do we do?

24:44.440 --> 24:46.160
We wait, they're sending someone.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.280
Wait for what?

24:47.760 --> 24:49.720
You're right.
We've got better things to do.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.200
Come on!

25:31.200 --> 25:32.200
Come on…

26:31.040 --> 26:31.920
Stop right there!

28:10.880 --> 28:11.920
It's okay…

28:12.920 --> 28:13.800
It'll be okay…

28:25.760 --> 28:27.280
No…

28:27.960 --> 28:29.520
Please, hang up!

28:31.320 --> 28:33.800
Hang up!

28:37.080 --> 28:38.000
I'm sorry…

28:53.720 --> 28:55.160
Is everything all right, sir?

28:57.800 --> 28:58.640
Very well…

28:59.480 --> 29:00.880
It's time.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.200
Of course.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.520
Sir!

29:25.800 --> 29:28.120
The balloons for your daughter.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.240
Oh yes, of course.

29:30.480 --> 29:31.800
-Thank you.
-There you go.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.480
Fucking heavy, isn't it?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.160
Don't drop it, it might open!

31:11.360 --> 31:12.440
I'll be back, Mom.

31:14.320 --> 31:15.400
I promise.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.640
Thomas is putting me up
until I find a place.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.640
I was living at Mom's, but…

31:32.200 --> 31:33.480
Want some more tea?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.600
No, thank you, I'm not staying.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.480
And this way, I can help with Louise.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.280
It hasn't been easy
for him since the divorce.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.280
Yeah, I know.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.760
I don't know what's keeping Thomas.
An emergency, apparently.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.040
It's okay. I'll see him at the station.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.280
Louise! Come say bye to your godfather!

31:56.440 --> 31:59.040
-It was nice of you to stop by.
-No, no problem.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.960
I wanted to attend the service,

32:01.040 --> 32:03.760
but we had a crisis meeting.
I couldn't get out of it.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.240
Are you guys having problems?

32:10.440 --> 32:12.160
That's a lovely police car.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.520
Agathe bought it for me.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.360
That was very nice of her.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.120
I had no choice.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.200
Some psychopath stole her toy
at the hospital.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.240
What? What an asshole!

32:23.320 --> 32:25.800
Marc, when is Daddy coming back?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.080
Exit the vehicle, sir.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.040
Lt. Blin, Crime Squad.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.920
It's not safe to park
in the middle of the street.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.880
Internal Affairs didn't stop by
the funeral parlor to search your car?

33:52.360 --> 33:53.880
-No.
-Good.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.520
So they found nothing.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.480
-What did you expect them to find?
-I don't know…

34:02.360 --> 34:04.800
There was a nice bundle of cash in there.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.600
You leave it there to get caught?

34:08.080 --> 34:10.360
I had no choice. I had to toss it all.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.360
You did good.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.320
It must be your way of thanking me.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.560
We'll split my share.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.480
Don't bother.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.360
Come on. Don't play that with me.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.680
Home care, the nursing bed…

34:31.160 --> 34:33.160
All that cash worked out for your mom.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.000
Does Valérie suspect anything?

34:38.960 --> 34:40.080
Excuse me?

34:40.160 --> 34:41.960
How long's your wife been depressed?

34:42.680 --> 34:44.760
Shooting up meds when you're not home.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.880
You paid for her Swiss rehab.
That costs a ton.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.040
What do you tell her?

34:51.640 --> 34:53.480
That our risk premiums shot up?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.600
That finally, being a cop pays well?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.080
That all that worry
is worth it until you retire?

34:59.160 --> 35:00.800
Is that what you're feeding her?

35:00.880 --> 35:02.480
Why are you bringing up my wife?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.120
Why are you bringing up my mom?

35:07.040 --> 35:08.400
Sorry to bother you guys,

35:08.480 --> 35:10.880
but a big fish got ratted out.
Vaubour's ecstatic.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.480
He wants to raid his hideout.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.640
We gotta move!

35:23.280 --> 35:25.200
-I need shells for the Benelli.
-Yes.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.720
What's all that gear?

35:28.800 --> 35:29.640
-That?
-Yeah.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.640
Little C4 packages with time delay.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.000
Cool! How do they work?

35:34.080 --> 35:34.920
Hang on.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.840
Look. Here's the detonator
which is triggered via Bluetooth.

35:40.920 --> 35:41.760
Yeah.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.000
This is the emitter,
inside this plastic case.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.040
It's really discreet,
like any old key chain.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.960
-Yeah, that's crazy.
-Then it's simple.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.800
You press on the button, here,

35:50.880 --> 35:54.160
the timer is preset to two minutes.
Once it hits zero, boom!

35:54.240 --> 35:56.280
Stop using your gadgets to flirt with her.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.040
Hand me my vest instead of chit-chatting.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.040
A hundred bucks says it gathers dust here.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.000
We could test it.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.640
You have to be trained with C4.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.440
You only have to press a button.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.240
We'll need it to blow open a door.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.240
And us with it?
No thanks. Quit dreaming.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.160
The M3 will do just fine.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.000
We're not going after Godzilla.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.920
-Thank you.
-See you later.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.400
-Bye.
-"Bye."

36:18.880 --> 36:20.000
-Is he hitting on you?
-No.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.240
-Yes.
-Absolutely not.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.840
Here's your new girlfriend.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.280
Manuel Barcelo.
Already charged with drug trafficking,

36:26.360 --> 36:28.960
associating with criminals
and pimping. To top it off,

36:29.880 --> 36:31.400
he's wanted by Interpol.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.120
If we arrest him,
it'll go down well. Got it?

36:34.200 --> 36:37.840
After the Internal Affairs bitch's show,
we need to boost our image.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.840
-Do we have to say "bitch"?
-Yes.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.760
Come on, hit the road. Let's move.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.480
Thomas, what are you doing?

36:49.440 --> 36:50.320
Yeah, I'm coming.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.160
-Well?
-Nothing.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.840
Where did that asshole go?

37:25.400 --> 37:26.560
There's no one here.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.200
We're sure he lives here.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.120
He suspected we were coming and left.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.400
He suspected nothing. He was tipped off.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.120
What do we do?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.480
We look for clues.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.760
He can't have vanished into thin air.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.720
Come on, get moving!

37:43.800 --> 37:45.200
Shit! We look like idiots!

39:18.040 --> 39:19.040
Can I help you, sir?

39:19.640 --> 39:20.840
What are you doing?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.280
Lt. Blin.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.360
-Brigadier Bertin, hello Lieutenant.
-Hello.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.320
Someone reported a car accident.
It must be here.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.280
Was anyone hurt?

39:32.360 --> 39:33.720
Yes, a hit and run, it seems.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.640
-And who reported this?
-An anonymous call.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.560
Where did you go? Did you find anything?

39:41.640 --> 39:42.960
Yes, this gentleman.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.440
-Brigadier Bertin, good day.
-Lt. Andrade.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.080
What are you doing in the area?

39:47.160 --> 39:49.400
Someone reported
a strange accident on the 9th.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.120
Strange? Meaning?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.600
A reckless driver hit a man,

39:52.680 --> 39:54.360
put him in his trunk and took off.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.160
That guy has some nerve.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.720
-Do you have a lead?
-Not yet.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.400
I need to check the surveillance footage.

40:10.520 --> 40:13.080
Maybe we'll find something on our guy.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.800
Can we also watch the tapes?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.040
Want to see them tonight, Lieutenant?

40:17.120 --> 40:18.720
I'm an officer in training.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.600
Well. Okay. See you later.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.000
See you later, Bertin.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.720
-I'll take care of the video.
-No.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.720
It's fine. Thomas, go home.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.760
Naomi, you handle the ticket report.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.840
What? I'm not a secretary.
I have to do the paperwork again?

40:32.920 --> 40:34.200
Okay, I'll take care of it.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.960
Thomas. Go home.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.160
You need to take a breather.

40:38.240 --> 40:41.320
Spend some time with your daughter.
It'll do you some good. Okay?

40:41.400 --> 40:42.800
-Marc, let me come…
-No.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.200
Stop. Marc is going, end of discussion.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.120
Fine.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.600
Now, let's move!

40:47.680 --> 40:49.400
I've had enough of you guys.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.760
-And gals.
-Come on, you.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.680
But seriously,
you're a pain with your reports.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.120
You're getting the hang of it!

40:59.200 --> 41:01.720
We've got it, Lieutenant.
The recordings from the 9th.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.840
-Surprise!
-What are you doing here?

41:05.920 --> 41:08.160
You're so stubborn,
I told you to stay home.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.800
I couldn't let you die of starvation now.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.760
-Fried chicken?
-Yeah, it's on me.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.120
Nice!

41:15.200 --> 41:16.560
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.080
Have any leads?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.160
What have we got?

41:22.320 --> 41:25.000
It happened here, but it's not clear.
The image is cut off.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.720
The quality is lousy, isn't it?

41:29.520 --> 41:30.360
Come on, eat.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.760
Wait.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.520
-Back it up.
-What?

41:36.600 --> 41:37.680
I said go back.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.440
Stop.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.320
Play it back frame by frame.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.480
Pause.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.800
That's him.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.200
Definitely.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.480
-Look at the brake lights.
-So what?

41:58.960 --> 41:59.800
So what?

42:01.200 --> 42:03.920
No other car's brake lights lit up
except for this one.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.000
That means, at some point,

42:06.600 --> 42:09.000
the driver saw someone
suddenly appear on the road.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.960
He slammed the brakes, too late. And bam!

42:12.560 --> 42:13.640
He hit the guy.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.040
Let's see the photos.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.280
Yes, it all fits.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.920
Skid marks,

42:26.920 --> 42:28.000
brake lights,

42:29.200 --> 42:30.520
the debris from the impact.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.040
Check out that dog.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.200
It's looking at the accident.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.760
It's there, surely.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.800
Back it up a bit.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.680
It's a gray BMW. Like yours.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.160
It looks like it, yeah.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.920
Zoom in on the license plate.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.680
What's the first letter?

43:04.520 --> 43:05.600
I see a "D."

43:06.440 --> 43:07.280
Yeah.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.640
Yeah, a "D," that's it.

43:10.440 --> 43:11.280
Do you agree?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.400
No, I would say an "O."

43:14.480 --> 43:15.520
No, it's not an "O."

43:15.600 --> 43:17.160
Wait, let's see the second one.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.760
Fuck! Dammit!

43:31.240 --> 43:32.600
Illegible, we see nothing.

43:32.680 --> 43:33.960
Eat up, it'll get cold.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.560
Come on.

43:42.000 --> 43:42.920
Hi.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.440
Hi, how are you?

43:46.120 --> 43:48.120
Do you know when
they'll pick up Mom's bed?

43:48.200 --> 43:50.120
No, I've called them three times.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.240
Is Louise asleep?

43:51.320 --> 43:52.600
Yes, have you seen the time?

43:53.400 --> 43:55.320
Sorry, but I did my best.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.840
You don't see much of her these days.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.480
Would you rather I quit?

44:00.440 --> 44:03.240
Actually, I wanted
to ask you about Mom's apartment.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.160
Do you think I could move in?

44:07.840 --> 44:09.920
It would be nice for my yoga classes.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.720
I won't bother anyone.

44:12.680 --> 44:13.680
What do you say?

44:14.240 --> 44:16.280
There's a tenant in there with a lease.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.680
We can't just evict him.

44:17.760 --> 44:19.760
Well, you're a cop, aren't you?

44:21.560 --> 44:22.480
I see no connection.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.160
By the way…

44:45.360 --> 44:47.040
Did you know she had a lover?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.640
-Who?
-Well, Mom.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.600
Our mother had a lover? What?

44:52.680 --> 44:57.200
Yes. Get this, yesterday, at the end
of class, I was relaxing in Shavasana.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.160
You know, the corpse pose.

45:03.080 --> 45:03.920
All of a sudden,

45:04.440 --> 45:06.440
I had a vision. A flash.

45:07.320 --> 45:10.040
Like with your divorce.
I wasn't wrong about that.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.320
Yeah, great vision.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.360
So what is it now?

45:14.440 --> 45:17.040
Well, I saw a man close to Mom.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.040
Lying down beside her.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.600
A younger man.

45:22.000 --> 45:22.840
I was shocked.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.800
-Go ahead, continue.
-Yeah.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.360
Here we go.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.120
Get in the right position.
Spread your legs.

45:45.240 --> 45:47.000
Yes, Lt. Blin, Crime Squad.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.520
<i>I'd like to report a man</i>
<i>who's wanted by your force.</i>

45:50.240 --> 45:51.400
<i>Can you write it down?</i>

45:51.480 --> 45:54.160
I'm not at my desk.
Speak to one of my colleagues, or…

45:54.240 --> 45:55.320
<i>I saw Manuel Barcelo.</i>

45:57.880 --> 45:58.760
What did you say?

45:59.240 --> 46:01.240
<i>I said I saw Manuel Barcelo.</i>

46:03.040 --> 46:05.520
-If this is a joke, it isn't funny.
<i>-What?</i>

46:06.160 --> 46:08.520
<i>It's a crime to report a wanted man?</i>

46:09.240 --> 46:11.320
-Fine, go ahead.
<i>-Can you write this down?</i>

46:11.400 --> 46:12.440
Yes, I'm listening.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.960
<i>I saw Manuel Barcelo.</i>

46:15.720 --> 46:18.000
You've already told me that.
So, where is he?

46:18.480 --> 46:19.960
<i>That's what I wanted to ask you.</i>

46:21.360 --> 46:23.480
What is this bullshit? What's your game?

46:23.560 --> 46:26.520
<i>Tell me, Lt. Blin, where did you take him?</i>

46:26.600 --> 46:27.760
What?

46:27.840 --> 46:30.680
<i>What did you do with him</i>
<i>after loading him into your car?</i>

46:32.760 --> 46:33.840
-My car?
<i>-Yes.</i>

46:33.920 --> 46:35.360
You're talking nonsense.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.240
<i>A gray BMW.</i>

46:37.840 --> 46:38.720
<i>That's it, right?</i>

46:49.120 --> 46:50.720
Change the target and continue.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.760
Okay, thank you.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.520
Thomas?

46:54.280 --> 46:55.120
Look.

46:55.600 --> 46:58.120
3 in the chest,
1 in the head, at 25 meters away.

46:58.200 --> 46:59.920
-Hey, I'm making progress.
-Yeah.

47:00.960 --> 47:02.160
I'm going to show Marc.

47:08.680 --> 47:10.120
UNKNOWN NUMBER

47:12.080 --> 47:13.360
Not gonna answer it?

47:15.040 --> 47:16.120
No, it's nothing.

47:21.240 --> 47:22.080
Hello?

47:24.960 --> 47:26.240
Okay, I'll tell him.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.920
It's a guy who wants you to answer.

47:38.560 --> 47:40.320
-Hello?
<i>-We got cut off, I believe.</i>

47:40.880 --> 47:42.960
<i>I didn't finish my statement, Lieutenant.</i>

47:45.440 --> 47:46.520
Who the fuck are you?

47:46.600 --> 47:48.400
<i>Someone who knows</i>
<i>you killed Manuel Barcelo.</i>

47:48.480 --> 47:50.320
I don't understand. Who are you?

47:50.400 --> 47:53.520
<i>Come on, Thomas, please.</i>
<i>This is getting embarrassing.</i>

47:53.600 --> 47:55.280
No, sir, this must be a mistake.

47:55.360 --> 47:56.480
A misunderstanding.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.640
<i>Don't be so tense.</i>

47:57.720 --> 48:00.240
<i>After all,</i>
<i>your car was fully restored, right?</i>

48:00.320 --> 48:01.440
My car?

48:01.520 --> 48:03.000
I just had a little accident.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.680
A minor crash covered by my insurance.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.520
So I'll repeat, you're mistaken.

48:07.600 --> 48:08.840
<i>That's cute.</i>

48:09.800 --> 48:11.920
<i>You even found</i>
<i>an alibi for your car. Bravo.</i>

48:12.000 --> 48:14.080
That's enough. Stop calling me, asshole.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.320
<i>What if I told the police</i>
<i>where you buried him?</i>

48:19.240 --> 48:20.440
That's it, I'm hanging up.

48:20.520 --> 48:23.520
<i>Careful, Thomas.</i>
<i>If you hang up, I'll rat you out.</i>

48:25.600 --> 48:26.800
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

48:27.720 --> 48:28.800
<i>See, you did kill him.</i>

48:29.280 --> 48:32.480
-You lousy son of a bitch.
-<i>Calm down, Thomas.</i>

48:34.120 --> 48:35.280
Who the fuck are you?

48:35.360 --> 48:36.360
Where'd you come from?

48:36.440 --> 48:39.360
<i>I'll let you think it over.</i>
<i>Don't worry, we'll talk again soon.</i>

48:39.440 --> 48:42.400
<i>One last thing,</i>
<i>don't get smart with me. You hear me?</i>

48:43.160 --> 48:44.280
<i>Don't get smart with me.</i>

48:45.080 --> 48:46.240
Fuck.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.920
You okay?

49:49.480 --> 49:50.320
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:55.280 --> 49:56.120
Where to?

49:57.520 --> 49:59.160
Nowhere. I mean, yes…

49:59.240 --> 50:00.920
I just came down to get my phone.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.400
What's with your car? It looks brand new.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.400
I got into an accident. Didn't I tell you?

50:07.320 --> 50:08.480
No.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.000
There you go…

50:10.080 --> 50:11.480
They changed the whole front?

50:11.560 --> 50:13.280
Yeah, no, I don't even know.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.240
Well at least you didn't get hurt.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.880
Yeah, no, I'm okay.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.520
-Don't worry. See you.
-Hey.

50:19.240 --> 50:21.720
Is your mother buried
in the cemetery by the sea?

50:25.920 --> 50:26.760
Yes, why?

50:26.840 --> 50:30.760
I got some intel.
It's where Barcelo's cell was last active.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.520
And?

50:35.600 --> 50:37.080
And, well, nothing.

50:37.640 --> 50:38.840
The area is too big,

50:38.920 --> 50:41.680
there aren't enough relay towers,
impossible to triangulate.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.880
-That's too bad.
-Yeah.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.800
Okay.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.200
-Your phone?
-Yeah, my phone.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.480
You forgot it again!

50:52.560 --> 50:53.760
No, I got it this time.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.600
-I'll see you upstairs.
-Okay.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Hello?

51:05.080 --> 51:07.080
<i>For a cop, you suck at car chases.</i>

51:07.600 --> 51:09.920
<i>What were you doing?</i>
<i>I was waiting for you.</i>

51:11.520 --> 51:12.400
<i>Well.</i>

51:13.080 --> 51:14.920
<i>Did you think it over? Can we talk now?</i>

51:15.440 --> 51:16.400
Fine, I'm listening.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.360
<i>Good. You've become reasonable.</i>

51:18.440 --> 51:20.560
-I have just one question.
<i>-I'm listening.</i>

51:21.280 --> 51:22.360
I was wondering,

51:22.840 --> 51:25.400
how did you see me
bury him in<i> </i>pitch-black night?

51:25.480 --> 51:27.400
<i>The night is no obstacle, my friend.</i>

51:27.480 --> 51:30.040
<i>I'm like a cat, I can see in the dark.</i>

51:30.120 --> 51:32.320
Cat, my ass. You saw nothing,
you know nothing.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.600
So, listen closely.

51:34.400 --> 51:36.880
You can report me. I don't give a crap.

51:38.240 --> 51:40.560
Dig wherever you want,
you won't find Barcelo.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.200
So, I'm going to hang up now.

51:42.280 --> 51:44.400
And you can go fuck yourself, asshole!

51:44.880 --> 51:46.960
There! Fuck!

51:49.320 --> 51:50.320
There.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.400
Tell me, are all vehicles
that enter and exit

52:02.480 --> 52:04.440
the station parking lot recorded?

52:04.520 --> 52:05.880
Affirmative, Lieutenant.

52:05.960 --> 52:08.080
All vehicle movements are recorded.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.560
<i>Do you want to see the list?</i>

52:10.240 --> 52:12.840
Is it possible to see
who came and left this morning?

52:12.920 --> 52:13.760
<i>Yes.</i>

52:20.640 --> 52:22.080
UNKNOWN NUMBER

52:26.680 --> 52:29.040
Don't send them to me. I'll come get them.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.360
Thanks a lot.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.920
Why won't you answer my calls?

52:45.720 --> 52:48.440
-What are you doing?
-Why aren't you answering my calls?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.240
Why won't you answer?

52:53.160 --> 52:54.000
Thomas?

52:56.400 --> 52:57.840
A cop? What do you mean?

52:57.920 --> 52:59.920
What do you expect?
This is a police station.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.800
I thought he was a thief.

53:01.880 --> 53:02.800
You know him?

53:02.880 --> 53:04.600
Obviously, he's Lt. Blin.

53:04.680 --> 53:05.920
He's part of my team.

53:06.640 --> 53:09.200
-Do you have a problem with him?
-No, no problem.

53:09.280 --> 53:12.000
I guess I made a mistake.
It's not him. Sorry.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.760
I know, hitting a colleague is wrong.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.840
You won't believe it
but I thought you were someone else.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.000
A thief. Sorry.

53:21.560 --> 53:22.400
Are you okay?

53:23.360 --> 53:26.480
Once again, my apologies. Lt. Blin, is it?

53:27.480 --> 53:28.600
Capt. Marelli.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.800
Miss, where's the bathroom?

53:34.880 --> 53:36.640
Do I look like a restroom attendant?

53:37.360 --> 53:39.120
At the back, in our locker room.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.720
I can't believe it.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.280
I got the wrong guy.

53:46.200 --> 53:47.520
I don't know how.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.440
You know that asshole?

53:52.400 --> 53:54.160
I graduated with Marelli, yeah.

53:54.720 --> 53:56.760
That's Antoine Marelli, head of Narcotics.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.520
Exactly, yes. In the flesh.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.120
-What's he doing here?
-No idea.

54:00.200 --> 54:01.640
We should report this.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.280
No, we'd better not. No.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.400
He beats up Thomas,
takes a piss and we do nothing?

54:07.480 --> 54:09.240
Precisely. We do nothing.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.560
And we say nothing.

54:14.720 --> 54:15.920
What?

54:18.440 --> 54:19.520
Naomi!

54:28.160 --> 54:32.600
But, Captain, your buddy, your classmate.
He's a psychopath, he's bipolar.

54:32.680 --> 54:33.960
He needs to be committed.

54:34.560 --> 54:35.760
First, he's not my buddy.

54:36.240 --> 54:40.640
Also, I'd love to hear
your personality disorder diagnosis.

54:42.840 --> 54:45.600
Finally, he blocked
the Internal Affairs investigation.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.120
What? Wait, how did he manage that?

54:49.080 --> 54:51.760
He didn't want Internal Affairs
snooping around drug busts.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.480
That's Narcotics' territory.

54:54.280 --> 54:56.040
One call from the top and it's over.

54:58.440 --> 55:00.120
Anyway, he saved all your asses.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.200
So we should thank him now?

55:02.280 --> 55:03.640
Naomi, the police…

55:03.720 --> 55:05.160
Are a family, I know.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.640
-Smoke break authorized?
-Yeah.

55:08.960 --> 55:12.200
Leave it, I'll handle it.
We'll have a calm discussion.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.720
You scared me.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.880
So you're a cop?

55:38.960 --> 55:40.160
That worries you, huh?

55:40.920 --> 55:44.600
The police always make us worried
when we don't have a clear conscience.

55:44.680 --> 55:45.920
What are you talking about?

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
The universe laughs at human morality.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.600
Honest people die despite their honesty.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.400
Evil people survive
despite their evilness.

55:54.480 --> 55:55.600
Too bad, but verifiable.

55:55.680 --> 55:56.880
Especially by an officer.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.400
Isn't that so, Lt. Blin?

56:01.480 --> 56:02.600
What do you want?

56:02.680 --> 56:05.440
It's about time.
It's the first good question you've asked.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.280
What I want…

56:09.080 --> 56:10.520
Bring me Barcelo tonight.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.680
Why?

56:14.440 --> 56:16.760
Curiosity killed the cat, my friend.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.640
Enough chit-chat. Just bring him to me.

56:22.800 --> 56:24.600
I don't know how I can.

56:25.640 --> 56:27.280
I have no idea where he is.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.280
I feel we don't understand each other.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.400
Get out of there! Get out!

57:37.400 --> 57:39.440
Quit squirming! Quit squirming!

57:44.720 --> 57:47.320
Submerging the airways
will lead to bradycardia.

57:48.960 --> 57:51.720
Your heartbeat will drop
and start to slow down.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.520
Come on, hold on!

57:57.120 --> 57:59.880
-There! Come back! You're here!
-No!

58:00.560 --> 58:02.320
Look at me!

58:02.400 --> 58:03.920
To avoid cardiac arrest,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.560
you must reduce
your body's need for oxygen.

58:06.640 --> 58:07.640
-Got it?
-Yes.

58:07.720 --> 58:08.960
-Let's get back!
-No!

58:14.560 --> 58:16.960
Limit muscular strain,
stay perfectly relaxed!

58:18.680 --> 58:20.680
Focus on your vital functions.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.000
There you go!

58:24.480 --> 58:25.560
That's it, good.

58:30.880 --> 58:32.720
That's good. Good.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.040
There. That's good.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.120
Fine.

58:48.960 --> 58:49.880
I didn't get that.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.000
Fine, I'll do it.

58:52.840 --> 58:55.320
The benefits of breath-holding.
I told you.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.680
Well, I must be on my way.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.520
I've got things to do.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.480
And two guys alone so long in a bathroom,

59:06.560 --> 59:07.680
people will gossip.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.040
And don't forget.

59:17.360 --> 59:18.880
Bring me Barcelo tonight.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.040
I'll contact you.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.800
I'm sorry, Mom.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.600
MARIE-JEANNE BLIN
MARCH 21 1930 - MAY 9 2021 - REST IN PEACE

1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.680
Why the hell is he looking for a dead man?

1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:46.600
There must be a reason.

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:03.320
BATTERY LEVEL LOW

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:14.760
What the fuck is that?

1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:16.720
Fuck…

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:17.640
What is this?

1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:04.880
SECURITY SAFE SERVICES
PRIVATE VAULTS

1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:21.920
<i>Fuck, Manu, this is the 20th time</i>
<i>I've called. You could've picked up.</i>

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.880
<i>I thought maybe Marelli took you out.</i>

1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:26.840
<i>So, where are you?</i>

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:29.320
<i>Answer, you asshole!</i>

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:31.560
<i>You're not Manu.</i>

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:35.040
<i>Who are you?</i>

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:36.160
<i>Shit, who are you?</i>

1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:40.600
The number belongs
to Michael Bourgi, 38 years old.

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:43.480
Arrested for fraud and computer hacking.

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:44.720
He's a small-time hacker.

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:46.920
<i>He grew up</i>
<i>in the same neighborhood as Barcelo</i>

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.080
<i>and they were spotted together recently.</i>

1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:52.960
Locate his position minute by minute
and send me his photo.

1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:55.640
That's crazy talk.
We need a warrant from a judge.

1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.840
Don't worry, I'll take responsibility.

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:03.240
-Was that Thomas?
-Yeah.

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.640
-What's he doing?
-That's what I'm wondering.

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:08.280
Shit. You're still working?

1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:10.320
I have to check the tickets for the team.

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:12.000
I'll help you then.

1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.600
So…

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:22.920
120 km/h in a 50 zone.
Shit, that's no small infraction.

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:24.480
That's for sure.

1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:33.440
Hey! Where do you think you are?

1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:35.720
Police! Everybody move! Go, on get out!

1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:37.320
-Everyone!
-I didn't do anything.

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.000
My arm! Let me go of me!

1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:40.640
-Bastard!
-It's okay!

1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.000
That's right. Come here.

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:44.240
Let me go!

1:05:44.280 --> 1:05:46.120
WE ARE OPEN

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:49.080
SORRY WE'RE CLOSED

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:01.760
I don't know anything.

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:02.840
Okay, you're sure?

1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:05.280
I told you, nothing. Please let me go!

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:07.880
Let's start with one hour in the dryer.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.760
What? No! Wait!

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:12.080
I promise, I'll talk!

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:13.840
Why is Marelli after Barcelo?

1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:15.920
-I don't know!
-Okay, I believe you.

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:18.720
-Very well!
-I don't know anything!

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:20.360
I swear!

1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:25.040
Here's what we're gonna do.
I suggest 1 hour 30 at 60 degrees.

1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:28.440
Because it won't shrink your clothes.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:30.000
-Bastard!
-How about 80.

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:33.440
I'm not sure. Do you prefer that?
You decide. Is 80 better?

1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:36.960
-You're out of your mind!
-I can't hear you. We'll go with 80, okay?

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.520
-Are you ready?
-Wait!

1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:40.040
I'll tell you everything!

1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:41.920
-What?
-I'll tell you everything!

1:06:42.400 --> 1:06:43.360
Well, there you go!

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:46.840
I'm listening.

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.400
Marelli is looking for a key.

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:51.320
What key?

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:54.200
The key to a vault.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:56.720
And what's in this vault?

1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:58.920
I don't know! I swear!

1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.600
-Great, come on.
-Okay!

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:02.280
Let's go. Hold on!

1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:04.160
-You're in for a real spin.
-Wait!

1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:05.760
-Let's go!
-I'll tell you!

1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:08.720
What's in that damn vault?

1:07:10.840 --> 1:07:11.680
Money.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.200
Drug money.

1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:15.760
What drug money?

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:17.040
Fuck…

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.240
What are you talking about?

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.680
Marelli took advantage
of his post at Narcotics

1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:25.080
to get his hands on a portion
of the drugs seized during raids.

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.760
<i>Narcotics obtain enormous quantities.</i>

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.160
<i>They're meant to destroy it all.</i>

1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:37.960
<i>And that's where</i>
<i>Marelli and Barcelo came in.</i>

1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:44.400
<i>They diluted the drugs in alcohol,</i>

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:48.560
<i>and sold it in private clubs.</i>

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.840
<i>It worked like a charm.</i>

1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:58.040
<i>Just one taste and people were hooked.</i>

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.680
<i>Marelli's network grew bigger</i> <i>by the day.</i>

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.880
<i>The Ukrainian Bratva,</i>

1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:09.880
<i>the Irish, the Chinese.</i>

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:12.560
<i>Everybody wanted to do business with him.</i>

1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:16.680
<i>Marelli was becoming</i>
<i>a major player and he loved it.</i>

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.920
<i>But Manu</i> <i>turned it all upside down.</i>

1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:23.560
<i>He sold it all</i>
<i>to the Albanians behind the boss' back.</i>

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:26.480
<i>Marelli was furious.</i>

1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.040
<i>-He did the guys in.</i>
-What?

1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:37.160
<i>They were found in a fridge, in pieces,</i>

1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:39.200
<i>in the hold of a tugboat.</i>

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:43.080
<i>The problem was that</i>
<i>the drugs had vanished.</i>

1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:48.520
<i>Manu had stored the cash</i>
<i>in a secret vault only he had the key to.</i>

1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:50.400
<i>Where's the key now?</i>

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:51.720
<i>On him.</i>

1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:53.760
<i>Well, inside him.</i>

1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:11.440
Fuck, what am I doing?

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:24.000
Oh fuck…

1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:26.000
Come on…

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:33.680
Thomas, don't move!

1:09:34.840 --> 1:09:35.800
Don't move.

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.480
-What are you doing?
-I didn't kill him.

1:09:39.320 --> 1:09:40.160
Drop the knife.

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:43.720
-Drop the fucking knife!
-Okay!

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:46.400
What is that?

1:09:48.120 --> 1:09:49.040
Give it here.

1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:51.360
I said give it!

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:56.520
Listen, I can explain everything.
I didn't kill him, okay?

1:09:56.600 --> 1:09:57.680
So why are you here?

1:09:57.760 --> 1:09:59.440
Put your gun down and I'll explain.

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:03.040
Are you going to explain this ticket too?

1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:04.840
Can you explain this?

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:07.120
Your car was damaged
the day before your crash.

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.080
I'll explain, just lower your gun!

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:13.280
Marc, calm down.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:15.960
Put these on.

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.440
Put the cuffs on.

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:18.800
Marc, stop.

1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:20.080
I said put them on.

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:21.480
Put them on.

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:26.200
Marc, let's talk calmly, okay?

1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:29.640
We'll talk calmly,
I'll tell you everything.

1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:32.160
-We're not model cops.
-Okay.

1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:33.120
But this is insane.

1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:38.040
-This is nonsense. I swear…
-Shut up!

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:46.640
Homicide, hit-and-run, body removal.
Do you realize what that means?

1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:51.320
That's life, guaranteed,
with a minimum of 20 years inside.

1:10:53.640 --> 1:10:55.200
What the fuck were you thinking?

1:10:57.960 --> 1:10:59.080
Got anything to say?

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:03.960
Don't you give a damn
about Louise or your daughter?

1:11:05.040 --> 1:11:07.200
How old will she be when you get out?

1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:12.040
What will you have done
for her in all those years?

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:14.600
Nothing.

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.040
Fuck, I would've given anything
to be a father.

1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:22.120
And you…

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:24.920
You fucking idiot…

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:31.760
Why are we here?

1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:35.160
We're not going to the station?

1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:39.960
Hello, it's Andrade.

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:42.920
Are we meeting at the usual spot?

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:45.880
Okay.

1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:00.920
This has gone too far, Thomas.

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:02.400
This is the end.

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:05.760
I'm returning the cash
and not covering things up anymore.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.360
Don't thank me, this isn't for you.

1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:39.040
What is this?

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.480
A cop is blackmailing me.

1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:47.480
Which cop?

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.480
Marelli, the head of Narcotics.

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:51.760
Shit…

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:55.040
It's true, I hit a guy with my car.

1:12:56.840 --> 1:12:58.560
But he'd already been shot to death.

1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:01.120
And when I…

1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.280
-Hello?
<i>-It's me.</i>

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:07.520
<i>Is Lt. Andrade there?</i>

1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:08.960
Why?

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:11.400
<i>-Is your colleague next to you?</i>
-Is that him?

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.160
<i>Get out of the car, we have to talk.</i>

1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.800
Okay, I got out. Where are you?

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:22.480
<i>Shut up and keep walking.</i>

1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:24.680
<i>Do you see the sewer grates?</i>

1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:26.080
Yes.

1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:28.080
<i>Take a few more steps.</i>

1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:32.920
Okay, I'm here.

1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:34.360
<i>Then don't move.</i>

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:36.400
Where are you, dammit? Hello?

1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.000
Hello?

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.000

<i>He's crying.</i>

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:23.400
<i>You're sentimental now?</i>

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.400
-Why'd you do that?
<i>-Let's get to business.</i>

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.760
You had no reason to.
I told you I would do it.

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:29.840
<i>Quit bawling.</i>
<i>Bring me Barcelo in the morning.</i>

1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:31.400
You know what?

1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:35.000
It's over, I'm turning myself in!

1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:36.320
You're finished!

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:39.600
You hear me? I'm telling them everything!

1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:41.440
<i>Oh yeah? You're gonna rat me out?</i>

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:43.600
<i>Sure about that?</i>

1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:45.360
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:48.600
<i>Who's there?</i>

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.280
<i>Capt. Marelli. I'm the one who called you.</i>

Nice to meet you.

<i>-Come in.</i>
-Listen to me.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:02.320
Listen to me!
Okay! I'll bring you the body.

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:03.960
Good evening, miss.

Good evening.

-You must be Louise.
<i>-Yes, that's me.</i>

Don't hurt them, please. I'll do it.

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:11.040
You'll get the body, don't hurt them!

1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:12.720
Don't hurt my daughter! Please!

-Thomas, are you okay?
-Where is he?

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:10.840
In the end, he said he'd come back later.

He couldn't stay.

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:16.480
Are you okay?

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:20.240

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:42.640
You decided suddenly?

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:46.720
You wanted to take her
on a weekend trip, now's your chance.

1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:50.200
You're not coming with us?

1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.960
No, I have to finish a thing at work.

-I am.

-Yeah, that's it.

1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:21.400
Put it here.

1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:25.840
We said no weapons.

1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:28.040
Back up.

1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:40.000
It's my keys, okay?

1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:43.680
Turn around.

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:57.360
Nice and cozy.

1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:01.120
-The bullet holes, that was you?
<i>-</i>Yeah, that was me.

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:04.120
I shot him and then you ran him over.

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:06.720
So, who do you think killed him?

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:07.640
You or me?

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:09.360
You want him, you got him.

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:10.800
You want a receipt?

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:13.000
Okay, I'm leaving.

1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:23.920
Thomas.

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:35.040
Clever, aren't you?

1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:37.920
You wanted to use my service weapon

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:39.560
to make it look like a suicide?

1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:44.120
An email goes out tomorrow if I die.

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:45.720
Everything's in it.

1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:47.960
The rerouted drugs, the hooker bars,

1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:49.560
Barcelo's murder.

1:20:49.640 --> 1:20:51.040
And Lt. Andrade's.

1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:54.520
You killed my best friend, asshole.

1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:59.160
I'm sure you've done much worse,
but you'll get life.

1:20:59.240 --> 1:21:00.960
That's it? That's all you've got?

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:03.080
What do you want? To kill me?

1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:04.560
Go ahead, shoot!

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:07.000
Shoot and it's over for both of us.
Go ahead, shoot!

1:21:08.560 --> 1:21:10.000
What are you gonna do? Shoot?

1:21:10.880 --> 1:21:13.640
Shoot or put the gun down?
Go ahead, I'm looking at you!

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.720
Why is that idiot coming back?

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:45.960
That's enough, leave me alone.

1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:47.720
Here, take your gun.

1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:51.680
A cop losing his gun is no good.
It'll also lead to an investigation,

1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:52.880
and that's never good.

1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:57.600
Blanks, I can't believe it. Here.

1:21:58.640 --> 1:21:59.520
All right.

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:01.840
-Thomas, come back here.
-Oh, shit.

1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.280
-Thomas, come back.
-What?

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.680
Your little schemes at the dock,
you deserve better.

1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.080
-You could make real cash with me.
-Leave me alone!

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:41.280
Come here!

1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:45.000
Wanted to fuck me over, did you?

1:23:47.400 --> 1:23:48.400
I'm gonna torture you.

1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:25.240
No!

1:24:56.480 --> 1:24:57.560
Okay, let's go.

1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:01.160
<i>You didn't forget to feed the fish?</i>

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:02.480
Don't worry about that.

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:04.680
I have to go now, all right?

1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:08.000
Daddy's working, but I'll call you later.

1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:09.200
<i>I love you, Daddy.</i>

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:11.360
I love you too.

1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:44.560
So, to sum up…

1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:47.240
Misappropriation and trafficking of drugs,

1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:49.560
murdering a police officer, hit-and-run,

1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:52.280
corpse removal,
theft and use of explosives.

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.280
You'll have to bury
all this shit, Vaubour.

1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:00.560
-Do you know how?
-Affirmative, Chief.

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:05.040
If this gets out to the new prefect,

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.880
it would be the end of us.

1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:09.720
Nothing will get out.
You have my word as a man.

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:14.000
Well, otherwise, Vaubour,
you'll be taking the fall for everything.

1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:16.760
You have my word as a civil servant.

1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:19.560
What about Lt. Blin?

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:50.480
I knew you'd be here.

1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:55.160
Vaubour told me you quit the force.

1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:59.360
Sorry. I wasn't in the mood
for leaving drinks.

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:02.080
What are you going to do now?
Any plans, or…

1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:06.120
I'm going to try to be a father.

1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:13.320
Well I think it's great you gave
your severance pay to Marc's wife.

1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:15.120
It won't bring him back, but…

1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:16.960
No, it won't.

1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:21.200
Vaubour told me
you aced your internship.

1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:24.360
Yeah, yesterday.

1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:25.360
Good job.

1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:26.800
Thank you.

1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:28.680
You're the future now.

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:30.680
So don't be like us.

1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:34.040
I was put in charge
of investigating Marc's death.

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:37.880
After his body
was transferred to Forensics

1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:39.800
we went through his car.

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:42.560
Well, what was left of it.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:44.840
And?

1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:47.840
I reckon it would be best
if no one found this.

1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.880
Especially not the Internal Affairs bitch.

1:27:58.640 --> 1:28:00.480
I'm no longer getting involved in this.

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:03.080
I just didn't want
Marc's memory to be tarnished.

1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:08.280
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.520
It's "Madam Lieutenant."

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:35.000
Your pass?

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:21.800
Insert the key and enter your code.

1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:22.760
Thanks.

1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:24.160
Is this for a withdrawal?

1:29:24.840 --> 1:29:26.520
-Yes.
-How much?

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:28.240
All of it.

1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:00.440
SECURITY SAFE SERVICES

1:30:14.800 --> 1:30:15.720
Come on.

1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:23.320
