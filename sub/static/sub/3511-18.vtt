00:19.733 --> 00:21.456
I sure could go for
something sweet.

00:21.457 --> 00:22.875
Do you want to grab
a bite to eat?

00:22.876 --> 00:26.042
Actually, it's not
food that I'm craving.

00:26.043 --> 00:27.300
Oh, uh...

00:28.376 --> 00:29.545
What? Is it...

00:29.570 --> 00:31.334
No, no. It's nothing.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.442
No, no. I happen to be
an expert on nothing.

00:33.443 --> 00:36.336
And this. This is not nothing.

00:37.424 --> 00:38.498
Okay. Fine.

00:38.499 --> 00:41.287
Um... do you know how you talk
in your sleep sometimes?

00:41.303 --> 00:41.842
Oh, yeah.

00:41.854 --> 00:43.934
Well, last night
you said a name.

00:43.935 --> 00:46.716
Oh...
and not your name I'm assuming.

00:46.717 --> 00:47.426
No.

00:47.427 --> 00:49.188
Well, I wouldn't read anything

00:49.189 --> 00:50.934
into one random utterance.

00:50.935 --> 00:52.418
14 utterances.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.672
And the name was Jordan.

00:53.673 --> 00:56.197
You said it over and over again.

00:56.686 --> 00:57.612
Who's Jordan?

00:58.867 --> 00:59.880
I have no idea.

00:59.881 --> 01:00.604
Is it a woman?

01:00.605 --> 01:01.736
No, it's nothing.

01:01.737 --> 01:03.000
Castle, I know nothing.

01:03.001 --> 01:04.654
Nothing is a dear
friend of mine.

01:04.655 --> 01:06.166
And this. This is not nothing.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.039
Yes, it is. Besides...

01:08.053 --> 01:09.610
most of what I say
is meaningless.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.255
Why would it be any
different when I'm asleep?

01:11.766 --> 01:12.913
We're not done here.

01:13.697 --> 01:16.164
Come on, Castle.
Who is Jordan?

01:16.165 --> 01:18.683
I got nothing to hide.
There's just nothing to tell.

01:18.872 --> 01:20.432
Then why are you
being so defensive?

01:20.433 --> 01:22.476
I'm not.

01:22.477 --> 01:23.969
Okay, fine.

01:24.442 --> 01:25.887
I'll just wait until
you're asleep.

01:25.888 --> 01:27.341
And then I'll ask you.

01:27.829 --> 01:28.806
You can't do that.

01:28.807 --> 01:31.276
Come on, Castle. You just said
that you had nothing to hide.

01:31.277 --> 01:32.786
Yeah, but interrogating
me in my sleep?

01:32.787 --> 01:34.100
Would you stoop that low?

01:34.101 --> 01:35.767
Who says I haven't already?

01:36.601 --> 01:37.895
- Hey, Lanie.
- Hey.

01:37.896 --> 01:40.329
Wow.
Talk about death by chocolate.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.231
Don't blame it on the
chocolate, Castle.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.647
A bullet's what did him in.

01:43.648 --> 01:45.492
So that red stuff's
not raspberry sauce?

01:45.493 --> 01:47.258
Afraid not. Exit wound.

01:47.259 --> 01:49.796
So he was shot in the back
and then fell in the mixer?

01:49.797 --> 01:51.527
Looks like, but before that,

01:51.528 --> 01:53.538
he may have struggled
with his attacker.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.605
Beige fibers--

01:54.606 --> 01:56.151
they were caught
on his watchband.

01:56.152 --> 01:57.692
CSU will run an analysis.

01:57.693 --> 02:00.151
Vic's name is Jimmy Whelan.
He's the owner of the shop.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.284
He has no record.

02:01.285 --> 02:03.992
And nothing in his bio that
points to who did this.

02:04.106 --> 02:05.770
You can rule out
dissatisfied customers.

02:05.771 --> 02:07.117
These things are insanely good.

02:07.118 --> 02:07.926
Eww.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.047
You're eating a
dead man's cupcake?

02:13.009 --> 02:15.047
There was free samples.

02:16.666 --> 02:17.486
Time of death?

02:17.487 --> 02:18.914
Between 11:30 and 12:00.

02:19.275 --> 02:20.593
Based on what?

02:20.594 --> 02:22.602
All of a sudden, you're an ME?

02:22.752 --> 02:24.924
I thought you liked it
when I played doctor.

02:29.057 --> 02:31.069
I, uh, based the time
of death on what

02:31.070 --> 02:32.331
the vic's assistant told me.

02:32.332 --> 02:33.511
Right over there.

02:35.028 --> 02:37.286
Okay, Todd, why don't you just
run us through what happened?

02:37.287 --> 02:39.559
Jimmy sent me on a
delivery at 11:30--

02:39.560 --> 02:42.235
a dozen red velvets to a
beauty shop down the way.

02:42.236 --> 02:43.873
And when I came back...

02:44.761 --> 02:46.558
He's a super-nice guy-- Jimmy.

02:47.137 --> 02:48.165
Well, is there
anyone in his life

02:48.166 --> 02:49.183
who didn't feel that way?

02:49.184 --> 02:50.153
I'm not sure.

02:50.154 --> 02:52.092
The truth is, this is
only my second week here.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.926
But he was acting real
strange right before I left.

02:55.161 --> 02:56.088
Strange how?

02:56.089 --> 02:58.621
This car... cruised by the shop,

02:58.622 --> 02:59.739
kinda slow.

02:59.994 --> 03:01.253
He got all nervous.

03:01.432 --> 03:02.874
That's when he
sent me on my run,

03:02.875 --> 03:05.278
like he wanted to get rid of me.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.020
What kind of car was it?

03:07.021 --> 03:09.251
It was a black '68 Charger R/T.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.002
I know my muscle cars.

03:12.003 --> 03:13.144
Did you see who was driving?

03:13.145 --> 03:15.240
No, but whoever it was
parked it around the corner

03:15.241 --> 03:16.215
as I was leaving.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.403
When I got back,
the car was gone,

03:19.445 --> 03:20.517
and there was Jimmy.

03:20.841 --> 03:23.301
Well, we'll need a detailed
description of that car.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.131
Looks like Jimmy kept a
lot of dough around here.

03:26.132 --> 03:27.422
It is a bakery.

03:27.597 --> 03:28.590
Good one.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.598
This briefcase was
stashed in his office.

03:30.599 --> 03:31.925
That's $50,000.

03:31.926 --> 03:34.364
Whoa. At $4 a pop,

03:34.365 --> 03:36.685
he would have to sell
12,500 cupcakes.

03:36.686 --> 03:37.694
That seems unlikely.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.109
Todd, what do you know
about that money?

03:39.110 --> 03:41.558
Nothing. I swear.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.387
But he's real paranoid
about that case.

03:43.388 --> 03:44.986
Twice a week, he'd take
it out of the safe

03:44.987 --> 03:46.876
and take it with him
down to Staten Island.

03:46.877 --> 03:49.017
- What for?
- Just said he had business there.

03:49.018 --> 03:51.645
Well, obviously Jimmy was into
more than just baking cupcakes.

03:51.646 --> 03:52.630
So let's look at all the owners

03:52.631 --> 03:54.464
of '68 Chargers in
the Metro area.

03:54.465 --> 03:55.635
You got it.

03:56.364 --> 03:57.645
Hey, where's Ryan?

03:59.019 --> 04:00.609
Oh, right.

04:01.764 --> 04:03.523
The appointment at 
Dr. Rosenberg's office

04:03.524 --> 04:04.546
is in 20 minutes.

04:04.547 --> 04:06.342
It's gonna take us at
least 15 to get there,

04:06.343 --> 04:07.862
so we should probably go, right?

04:07.863 --> 04:10.104
Which means you should probably...

04:12.421 --> 04:15.539
Hey, what's the matter?

04:16.103 --> 04:17.406
What if it's my fault?

04:17.493 --> 04:20.889
What if it turns out that there's
something wrong with me?

04:20.890 --> 04:22.653
It's nobody's fault, Kev.

04:22.654 --> 04:25.104
We just need to know
what's going on.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.264
You want some help?

04:32.148 --> 04:32.970
Nice.

04:32.971 --> 04:35.299
So master baker Jimmy Whelan,

04:35.300 --> 04:38.942
longtime purveyor of caloric
yet delicious baked goods,

04:38.943 --> 04:40.891
sponsor of a local
kids' softball team,

04:40.892 --> 04:42.972
charter member of the small
business roundtable--

04:42.973 --> 04:45.701
but what was he doing
with 50 grand in cash,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.429
and why the secret trips
to Staten Island?

04:47.430 --> 04:49.914
Sounds like you're not the only
one keeping secrets, Castle.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.394
I'm going to ignore that.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.614
That's peculiar.

04:52.615 --> 04:54.091
What's so peculiar about
wanting to ignore--

04:54.092 --> 04:56.105
No, no, no, I mean
these purchase orders.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.743
They show that Jimmy
spent over $70,000

04:58.744 --> 05:00.067
on kitchen equipment.

05:00.068 --> 05:02.467
Like a 20-foot-wide
walk-in freezer.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.558
I don't remember seeing that.

05:03.559 --> 05:04.587
That's because there wasn't one.

05:04.588 --> 05:05.933
It wouldn't even fit
in his kitchen.

05:05.934 --> 05:08.794
Yo. So I ran '68 Chargers.

05:08.795 --> 05:10.966
There's only a handful of them
on the road, but get this.

05:10.967 --> 05:14.276
One of 'em is registered
to a Robert S Shannon,

05:14.277 --> 05:16.461
AKA Bobby S.

05:16.675 --> 05:17.357
He's a shot caller

05:17.358 --> 05:19.429
for the Irish mob over
in Staten Island.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.132
He's a ruthless son
of a bitch, too--

05:21.133 --> 05:22.335
drug trafficking, assaults.

05:22.336 --> 05:25.052
He's suspected of half a dozen
murders over in Staten Island.

05:25.053 --> 05:27.907
Wait a minute. Secret trips to
Staten Island, all that cash...

05:28.053 --> 05:30.216
What if the cupcake shop
is actually a mob front?

05:30.217 --> 05:32.192
Jimmy Whelan the baker

05:32.193 --> 05:34.095
is actually Jimmy Whelan
the money launderer.

05:34.096 --> 05:35.981
Bobby S could've had a
falling out with him,

05:35.982 --> 05:36.897
could've whacked him.

05:36.898 --> 05:38.376
Maybe, but we're gonna need more

05:38.377 --> 05:39.746
than just his car
at the crime scene

05:39.747 --> 05:40.983
to connect him to that murder.

05:40.984 --> 05:42.861
Well, I may have somebody who
can help us out with that.

05:42.862 --> 05:44.125
I pulled Jimmy's phone records.

05:44.126 --> 05:47.142
In the last three days, he
received numerous calls

05:47.143 --> 05:50.190
from a woman named, um...
Sibhan...

05:50.191 --> 05:51.275
Siob--

05:51.552 --> 05:53.233
Siob--Sib--

05:53.234 --> 05:54.382
- Siobhan.
- Siobhan?

05:54.383 --> 05:57.350
Yeah, the Irish are notorious
for spelling names

05:57.351 --> 05:58.981
in wild and
unpronounceable ways.

05:58.982 --> 06:00.118
I don't even see how
you get that from--

06:00.119 --> 06:01.197
you're not alone.

06:01.198 --> 06:03.193
Anyway, Siobhan O'Doul,

06:03.194 --> 06:04.984
she runs a bar over
in Staten Island.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.828
And according to
organized crime,

06:06.829 --> 06:09.542
it's a place where Bobby S
does a lot of his business.

06:09.649 --> 06:11.469
Does Siobhan happen
to own that bar?

06:11.470 --> 06:13.829
She does, yeah.

06:16.346 --> 06:18.123
Thank you for coming in,
Ms. O'Doul.

06:18.124 --> 06:20.101
Anything for New York's finest.

06:20.102 --> 06:21.556
Yeah, especially considering

06:21.557 --> 06:23.624
that a felony charge
like obstruction

06:23.625 --> 06:25.600
would cost you your
liquor license.

06:25.604 --> 06:26.758
What do you want?

06:27.845 --> 06:30.541
I need some answers
about Jimmy Whelan.

06:31.359 --> 06:32.333
Never heard of him.

06:32.334 --> 06:35.508
That's funny considering
you made seven phone calls

06:35.509 --> 06:37.935
to him over the last three days.

06:38.172 --> 06:40.511
Oh, Jimmy the baker.

06:40.874 --> 06:43.738
Yeah, I-I'm thinking of
ordering some cupcakes.

06:43.739 --> 06:45.878
Yeah, well, you missed your chance.
He was killed.

06:47.468 --> 06:48.202
When?

06:48.203 --> 06:49.285
Earlier today.

06:49.286 --> 06:50.643
Do you know anything about it?

06:51.618 --> 06:52.971
No. Why would I?

06:52.972 --> 06:55.238
Well, we think that someone
that frequents your bar

06:55.239 --> 06:56.360
was involved.

06:58.022 --> 07:00.162
What can you tell
me about Bobby S?

07:02.760 --> 07:04.253
I'm not saying another word.

07:04.388 --> 07:07.534
Give me my phone call.
I want my phone call now.

07:10.863 --> 07:11.659
Hey, guys.

07:11.660 --> 07:12.578
Hey, what's up, man?

07:12.579 --> 07:13.600
Sorry I'm late.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.966
How did the, uh, thing
go, with the, uh...

07:15.967 --> 07:17.640
You know, do the
thing in the thing

07:17.641 --> 07:19.349
and give the thing
to the doctor?

07:19.874 --> 07:22.682
Yeah. Uh, it went... fine.

07:23.646 --> 07:24.660
So are your swimmers swimming?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.919
Um, I don't know yet.

07:26.920 --> 07:27.898
Hey, caught a case.

07:27.899 --> 07:29.098
Yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, we did.

07:29.099 --> 07:30.467
Let me bring you up to speed.

07:30.468 --> 07:31.518
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

07:31.558 --> 07:32.486
Hey, what's up, Jenny?

07:32.487 --> 07:34.347
Kevin, you forgot your lunch.

07:34.348 --> 07:35.295
Thanks, baby.

07:35.391 --> 07:36.969
What would you do
without me, huh?

07:38.031 --> 07:39.210
Fenton?

07:40.731 --> 07:41.821
Siobhan?

07:42.315 --> 07:43.634
Fenton.

07:46.463 --> 07:48.663
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

07:48.699 --> 07:50.062
That's my husband.

07:51.315 --> 07:52.459
You're married?

07:53.899 --> 07:55.828
Oh, lady, you can't slap a cop.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.304
You're a cop?

07:57.305 --> 07:58.837
- Ohh!
- Ugh!

07:59.225 --> 08:01.208
You liar! You son of a bitch!

08:01.209 --> 08:04.576
How could you?!
Get off of me! Let go!

08:08.945 --> 08:10.331
I can explain.

What do you know about this?

08:30.392 --> 08:31.438
Not a thing.

08:31.439 --> 08:32.121
Come on.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.582
Is it possible our Ryan

08:33.583 --> 08:35.573
is involved in something
scandalous and tawdry?

08:35.573 --> 08:37.804
Ryan? No way.
He doesn't have it in him.

08:37.806 --> 08:38.715
Yeah, but did you see the way

08:38.716 --> 08:40.688
Siobhan gave him that
flying lip lock?

08:40.690 --> 08:43.212
They--ooh. Look, Jenny's pissed.

08:43.212 --> 08:44.313
Yeah, well, it's not surprising

08:44.314 --> 08:45.773
when you find out someone
you're in a relationship with

08:45.774 --> 08:47.675
is keeping a secret.

08:47.676 --> 08:48.597
I...

08:49.377 --> 08:50.513
Be cool. Here he comes.

08:50.514 --> 08:52.690
Act normal. Act normal.

08:52.691 --> 08:54.320
- I am. This is normal.
- I can't--

09:03.788 --> 09:04.686
Damn.

09:04.687 --> 09:05.944
Bobby S.

09:06.568 --> 09:07.797
Are we thinking that this guy

09:07.798 --> 09:08.980
is the one that took
out Jimmy Whelan?

09:08.981 --> 09:10.925
Wait. You know Bobby S?

09:10.926 --> 09:12.803
Yeah, we were friends
back in the day.

09:12.804 --> 09:15.779
You were friends with this lowlife?
How's that?

09:15.780 --> 09:17.336
We used to run in the same crew.

09:21.664 --> 09:24.130
I was undercover for 14 months

09:24.131 --> 09:25.668
before I joined homicide.

09:26.177 --> 09:28.061
You were undercover
on Staten Island?

09:28.062 --> 09:29.243
With the Irish mob?

09:29.244 --> 09:31.452
Yeah.
So what do we got on Bobby S?

09:31.453 --> 09:32.399
No. Hold on. Hold on.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.915
Just go back for a
second, please.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.150
You were undercover?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.088
That's where you and
Siobhan used to--

09:38.089 --> 09:39.524
It's complicated.

09:39.525 --> 09:40.749
I love complicated.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.223
How is Siobhan
connected to all this?

09:42.224 --> 09:43.370
She knows the vic.

09:43.371 --> 09:45.201
And she knows Bobby S,
obviously.

09:45.202 --> 09:46.815
But she's not talking.

09:46.834 --> 09:49.444
Well... maybe she'll talk to me.

10:01.991 --> 10:04.548
So I guess it's not
Fenton O'Connell.

10:05.527 --> 10:08.296
It's Kevin. Kevin Ryan.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.748
Well, at least you're Irish.

10:11.285 --> 10:12.731
You didn't lie about that.

10:13.342 --> 10:14.983
I didn't lie about
a lot of things.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.775
They said you went into hiding.

10:19.499 --> 10:22.354
Seven years without a word.

10:23.252 --> 10:24.122
Yeah, I know.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.543
You do not know.

10:26.963 --> 10:28.088
Believe me, I didn't want to go.

10:28.089 --> 10:29.228
Spare me.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.925
You didn't even have the guts

10:30.926 --> 10:32.821
to tell me to my face.

10:32.822 --> 10:34.923
Just a note on the dresser.

10:36.644 --> 10:38.183
Siobhan, I know you're angry.

10:39.987 --> 10:41.049
But if you're in trouble,

10:41.195 --> 10:43.385
if you know something about
Bobby S killing this guy,

10:43.386 --> 10:44.361
tell me.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.593
Let me help you.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.737
You can go straight to hell,

10:50.054 --> 10:51.083
cop.

10:57.481 --> 10:58.488
Deep cover?

10:58.611 --> 10:59.847
I can't believe he
didn't tell me.

10:59.848 --> 11:01.640
Espo, he didn't even tell Jenny.

11:01.641 --> 11:03.694
Yeah, but I'm his best friend.
She's just the wife.

11:03.695 --> 11:06.694
Thus proving why there
is no Mrs. Esposito.

11:06.695 --> 11:09.307
Hey, it's hard to find a
woman for this much man.

11:10.434 --> 11:11.698
So how'd it go?

11:12.696 --> 11:13.870
It didn't.

11:14.442 --> 11:15.158
So, uh,

11:15.159 --> 11:17.219
what do we think Bobby's motive
was for killing this guy?

11:17.220 --> 11:18.112
We don't know.

11:18.113 --> 11:19.580
But it seems like
the two of them

11:19.581 --> 11:21.268
had a falling out of some sort.

11:21.269 --> 11:22.987
Yeah, you could put it that way.

11:23.598 --> 11:24.611
And you are?

11:24.612 --> 11:26.742
Special Agent Sam Walker, FBI.

11:26.743 --> 11:27.661
I'm Detective Beckett.

11:27.662 --> 11:29.558
This is Detective
Ryan and Esposito.

11:29.559 --> 11:31.455
Ryan? Kevin Ryan?

11:31.456 --> 11:33.509
- You've heard of him?
- Yeah, of course.

11:33.510 --> 11:35.492
This man got inside the
Irish mob with a wire

11:35.493 --> 11:36.757
when no one else could.

11:36.758 --> 11:39.042
You helped put away half
the crew in Staten Island.

11:39.319 --> 11:40.935
Too bad the weeds
grew back, huh?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.203
They always do.

11:42.225 --> 11:45.033
So what's the FBI's interest
in our murder investigation?

11:45.034 --> 11:47.222
Your victim--Jimmy Whelan.

11:47.537 --> 11:48.920
He was my informant.

11:50.926 --> 11:52.525
Jimmy was just running his shop,

11:52.526 --> 11:53.529
trying to get by,

11:54.070 --> 11:55.327
but then when the
economy turned,

11:55.328 --> 11:56.415
he borrowed some hard money,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.282
and after that, Bobby S
owned him.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.753
So Jimmy was feeding you
intel on Bobby's operations.

12:00.754 --> 12:01.507
No, more than that.

12:01.508 --> 12:03.318
He was gonna help us
get the crew's bible.

12:03.357 --> 12:04.326
The bible?

12:04.401 --> 12:06.321
I'm guessing we're not
talking about the holy book.

12:06.322 --> 12:08.301
No, it was just something
the crew called it.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.720
It's a list of transactions and
contacts going back years.

12:10.721 --> 12:13.259
You get that bible, you'll
take down the whole crew.

12:13.338 --> 12:15.169
So now that Jimmy's gone,
you're back to square one.

12:15.170 --> 12:17.553
Pretty much, though we
still have Siobhan.

12:17.949 --> 12:19.223
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

12:19.224 --> 12:20.548
She's my informant, too.

12:20.549 --> 12:22.943
What? Siobhan wouldn't snitch.

12:22.944 --> 12:24.312
Maybe not the old Siobhan.

12:24.313 --> 12:25.814
But the truth is, once you left,

12:25.815 --> 12:27.221
she fell on hard times.

12:28.287 --> 12:29.739
The crew drinks at her bar.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.522
They talk to her.
They trust her.

12:31.523 --> 12:33.725
Bobby S even keeps an
office in the basement.

12:33.726 --> 12:35.454
So when she wanted out,
we made an offer.

12:35.592 --> 12:36.780
For what, Witness Protection?

12:36.781 --> 12:38.752
Yeah, if she helps us
bring down the crew.

12:38.762 --> 12:41.384
Helping us get the bible,
that was gonna be her ticket.

12:42.036 --> 12:44.242
Well, until Bobby S figured out

12:44.243 --> 12:45.459
that Jimmy was a rat

12:45.588 --> 12:46.613
and had him killed.

12:46.614 --> 12:48.976
So that's why she called
Jimmy, to warn him?

12:48.977 --> 12:49.790
Yeah.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.688
Jimmy thought he could
talk his way out of it.

12:51.999 --> 12:53.379
Of course, he couldn't.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.347
So what happens to Siobhan now?

12:57.010 --> 12:58.164
She goes back in.

12:58.789 --> 12:59.758
She can't.

12:59.759 --> 13:00.939
Not now. I--

13:00.941 --> 13:02.248
It's too dangerous.

13:02.659 --> 13:03.600
She knows the risks.

13:03.601 --> 13:05.803
Agent Walker, if we
linked her to Jimmy,

13:05.804 --> 13:07.260
then Bobby S can, too.

13:07.261 --> 13:08.954
Look, Siobhan is
free to walk away.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.140
And go where?

13:10.141 --> 13:12.338
You don't just walk
away from Bobby S.

13:12.339 --> 13:14.782
Everybody knows that.
He's gonna hunt her down.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.880
You have to put her in
Witness Protection.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.644
Yeah, for the bible, sure.

13:18.767 --> 13:21.611
But Witness Protection isn't
some entitlement program.

13:21.896 --> 13:23.375
Siobhan has to earn it.

13:23.877 --> 13:24.714
Excuse me.

13:24.715 --> 13:26.119
I need to meet with her now.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.705
The feds are hanging
her out to dry.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.386
And when Bobby finds out,
he'll kill her for sure.

13:37.439 --> 13:38.453
Look, Siobhan,

13:38.454 --> 13:40.041
the main thing is not to panic.

13:40.042 --> 13:42.725
You don't want to do anything
that might arouse suspicion.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.835
Just keep your head down for a while.
You'll be fine.

13:44.836 --> 13:45.794
No.

13:46.009 --> 13:47.344
You'll be dead.

13:47.472 --> 13:49.753
Look at you, telling the truth.

13:50.101 --> 13:53.350
The cop is right.
I'm screwed six ways to Sunday here.

13:53.351 --> 13:54.903
Where does Bobby S
keep the bible?

13:54.904 --> 13:56.403
In his bedroom safe.

13:56.404 --> 13:57.565
How was Jimmy gonna get it?

13:57.566 --> 14:00.052
Every Thursday, Bobby S
has the guys over to bet on pool.

14:00.053 --> 14:01.629
Jimmy was supposed
to do it then.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.058
What about the combination?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.978
Bobby changes it every Friday.

14:05.121 --> 14:06.860
But I know the system he uses.

14:06.895 --> 14:09.127
And Jimmy could get the bible
because he was one of the crew,

14:09.128 --> 14:11.006
and he had access
to Bobby S's house.

14:11.007 --> 14:12.768
And now we got no one inside.

14:14.518 --> 14:15.712
I'll go in.

14:16.994 --> 14:18.194
I'll get the bible.

14:18.412 --> 14:19.388
Really?

14:19.389 --> 14:21.170
You? How?

14:21.431 --> 14:23.499
You know how close I was
to Bobby S back then.

14:23.576 --> 14:25.397
My Fenton O'Connell
cover is still good.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.157
Detective, that was
seven years ago.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.043
As far as the crew knows,

14:28.044 --> 14:29.588
I bolted when the
feds swooped in.

14:29.589 --> 14:31.949
You guys even filed indictments
against Fenton O'Connell, right?

14:31.950 --> 14:32.609
Yeah.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.678
How long has law enforcement
been after that bible,

14:35.060 --> 14:37.111
15, 20 years, huh?

14:37.269 --> 14:39.022
These guys are
drug-dealing parasites.

14:39.437 --> 14:41.815
When are you gonna get another
shot to wipe 'em all out?

14:41.816 --> 14:43.075
Look, you want the bible,

14:43.128 --> 14:44.409
we want Bobby S for murder,

14:44.410 --> 14:46.033
Siobhan wants to keep breathing.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.563
Everybody wins.

14:48.607 --> 14:49.863
I can do this.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.761
Let me run this by my ASAC.

15:00.390 --> 15:01.683
What are you doing?

15:02.572 --> 15:04.118
Are you out of your mind?

15:05.780 --> 15:08.751
I was Fenton.
I can be him again.

15:08.815 --> 15:10.469
Don't get yourself
killed on my account.

15:10.511 --> 15:12.147
Okay. Yeah, you hate me.

15:12.306 --> 15:14.065
I get that, and I deserve it.

15:14.658 --> 15:17.201
But do you want to be put in
witness relocation or not?

15:17.559 --> 15:18.654
Yes or no?

15:22.933 --> 15:24.091
Detective...

15:24.951 --> 15:26.543
Were you serious
about that offer?

15:32.340 --> 15:34.658
You've been out of it a
long time, Detective.

15:34.785 --> 15:36.387
There's a new hierarchy,

15:36.593 --> 15:39.441
and you're going to have
to win them over, fast.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.061
Seven years since
you were Fenton--

15:53.392 --> 15:54.587
that's a lifetime.

15:55.837 --> 15:57.845
It's not enough to act like him.

15:57.978 --> 15:59.640
You must become him.

16:00.354 --> 16:02.017
I am Fenton O'Connell.

16:02.968 --> 16:04.497
If you're not convincing,

16:05.075 --> 16:05.910
you're dead.

16:06.302 --> 16:07.984
I am Fenton O'Connell.

16:17.249 --> 16:18.984
I am Fenton O'Connell.

16:30.903 --> 16:32.161
I don't like this, bro.

16:32.178 --> 16:34.776
You don't have a
wire, no locator.

16:35.860 --> 16:37.507
If I did, Bobby S
would find 'em.

16:37.535 --> 16:39.051
This is the way
it's gotta be, man.

16:39.804 --> 16:41.292
What's the name of Agent
Walker's informants

16:41.339 --> 16:42.453
who will vouch for you?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.207
The Mason Brothers,
Matt and Tony.

16:44.417 --> 16:45.290
Where'd you do
your last stretch?

16:45.385 --> 16:46.763
Elmira for man one.

16:46.855 --> 16:48.206
I can even tell you
my cell number.

16:48.243 --> 16:49.592
I know what I'm doing, okay?

16:50.254 --> 16:51.593
What about Siobhan?

16:51.625 --> 16:53.113
Our plan is solid.

16:54.434 --> 16:55.630
I got this.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.013
See you on the other
side, partner.

17:00.415 --> 17:01.346
Mm-hmm.

17:37.619 --> 17:41.145
What, this is the
welcome I get, huh?

17:41.969 --> 17:44.085
None of you Irish
bastards missed me, huh?

17:45.289 --> 17:46.263
Fenton?

17:46.980 --> 17:48.632
Fenton O'Connell?

17:51.125 --> 17:52.074
Hey, Siobhan.

17:52.713 --> 17:53.495
Ugh!

17:56.095 --> 17:57.256
Nice to see you, too, Maggie.

17:57.287 --> 17:59.632
What'd you expect, a parade?

17:59.658 --> 18:01.317
After what you did to Siobhan?

18:02.512 --> 18:03.917
- Unh-unh.
- One shot's all you get.

18:03.944 --> 18:05.965
Hey, take your hands
off the lady.

18:08.863 --> 18:10.588
Long as she keeps her
hands off of me.

18:15.446 --> 18:17.817
Seven years, Fenton?

18:17.870 --> 18:18.981
Where the hell have you been?

18:19.014 --> 18:20.534
Look, you're pissed. I get it.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.245
But we'll work all this...
out, maybe a little less publicly.

18:24.282 --> 18:25.692
But first I need to
talk to Bobby S.

18:25.728 --> 18:27.564
Oh, that's why you
came back, for Bobby?

18:27.596 --> 18:28.683
Let me handle my business,

18:28.706 --> 18:30.592
and then I'll have nothing
but time for you.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.624
Ah, you are such a charmer.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.108
But if it's Bobby S
you're after,

18:35.124 --> 18:36.925
you're gonna have to go
through his number two.

18:36.973 --> 18:38.742
Yeah? Who might that be?

18:38.801 --> 18:40.204
My husband...

18:40.944 --> 18:41.792
Liam.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.082
I'm telling you, man.
He's not the Ryan I know.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.142
And I'm not just talking about
the haircut and the clothes.

18:52.195 --> 18:52.965
It's like he's a different dude.

18:53.002 --> 18:54.695
That's what he's supposed to be.

18:54.738 --> 18:56.588
He's in character.
He's Fenton. That's good.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.644
Yeah, but what if
he's not good enough?

18:57.672 --> 18:59.290
After seven years,
he's gotta be rusty.

18:59.315 --> 19:01.024
And these Staten Island
boys are no joke.

19:01.169 --> 19:02.767
You guys, the best
way to help Ryan

19:02.810 --> 19:05.178
is by building a case
against Bobby S.

19:05.221 --> 19:07.132
That might be trickier
than we thought.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.157
Bobby S's '68 Charger has
an electronic E-Z pass,

19:10.204 --> 19:11.046
and records show

19:11.099 --> 19:12.748
the Charger drove to Yonkers

19:12.764 --> 19:15.279
via the George Washington
Bridge around 10:00 AM.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.917
It didn't make the return
trip till after 2:00 PM.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.720
Jimmy was killed between
11:30 and 12:00.

19:18.738 --> 19:19.968
That puts Bobby in the clear.

19:20.011 --> 19:21.008
How is that possible?

19:21.040 --> 19:23.155
The car that Todd saw
outside of the bakery

19:23.171 --> 19:24.549
had to have been Bobby S's.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.902
Maybe he somehow
disabled his E-Z pass,

19:26.920 --> 19:28.175
making it appear as
though all he did

19:28.203 --> 19:29.748
was go to and from Yonkers.

19:29.764 --> 19:30.884
Okay, yeah, but how
do we prove that?

19:30.921 --> 19:32.782
We figure out where he went
when he was in Yonkers.

19:32.819 --> 19:33.842
And then we find evidence

19:33.911 --> 19:35.862
that he left during our
time-of-death window.

19:35.895 --> 19:38.389
He's trying to build an alibi,
and we're gonna tear it down.

19:42.416 --> 19:43.418
Give me your phone.

19:43.578 --> 19:44.324
Why?

19:44.708 --> 19:47.801
Bobby S has an abiding
distrust of electronic devices.

19:47.828 --> 19:48.992
Give me your phone.

19:56.511 --> 19:58.777
Whoa. Whoa.
What'll the missus think, huh?

20:07.544 --> 20:08.615
Hey, Bobby.

20:12.663 --> 20:13.850
Do I know you?

20:13.898 --> 20:15.868
What the hell? It's me Fenton.

20:17.147 --> 20:20.698
I recall knowing a Fenton
O'Connell years ago.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.107
He was like a brother to me.

20:24.159 --> 20:25.661
Real stand-up guy...

20:26.346 --> 20:27.615
Till he cut and ran.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.216
Come on, Bobby.

20:29.321 --> 20:31.188
I got ratted out. You know that.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.266
Me hanging around

20:32.325 --> 20:34.142
woulda just brought more
heat down on everyone.

20:34.174 --> 20:35.673
So you made yourself scarce.

20:35.700 --> 20:40.150
In fact, no one's heard from you in...
seven years.

20:40.820 --> 20:41.628
Where you been?

20:41.740 --> 20:42.554
Out west.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.650
Been making some
moves here and there

20:43.692 --> 20:45.813
until the statute of
limitations ran out.

20:45.831 --> 20:47.168
Tell you the truth, Bobby,

20:47.367 --> 20:48.320
I didn't want to come home

20:48.352 --> 20:50.167
till I had something
to bring to the table.

20:50.279 --> 20:51.246
Well, friend...

20:52.491 --> 20:53.798
Here's the table.

20:55.898 --> 20:57.694
I heard the feds took
down Ben Gideon,

20:57.726 --> 20:59.447
so you might be in
need of some product.

20:59.495 --> 21:01.981
I been working with the Mason
Brothers out of Chicago.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.050
I've heard of 'em.

21:04.148 --> 21:06.693
It's a stable source,
quality stuff.

21:06.825 --> 21:08.540
I can get you whatever you need.

21:10.260 --> 21:11.701
This is me stepping up, Bobby.

21:11.994 --> 21:13.421
So what...

21:15.184 --> 21:17.616
You're the wild rover
from the song?

21:17.792 --> 21:20.483
"Returning with gold in
great store," is that it?

21:22.481 --> 21:23.658
Or are you a rat?

21:23.814 --> 21:25.122
You know me better than that.

21:26.051 --> 21:26.814
Well...

21:26.834 --> 21:29.899
I said my piece, but I'm
not gonna beg, Bobby.

21:29.937 --> 21:31.016
It's up to you, okay?

21:31.367 --> 21:32.800
Oh, yeah, it is.

21:36.290 --> 21:37.368
So...

21:37.410 --> 21:39.886
Should I welcome home
the prodigal son,

21:40.048 --> 21:41.063
or should I have
Liam put a bullet

21:41.101 --> 21:42.555
in the back of your head?

21:42.873 --> 21:44.883
Oh, just say the word, Bobby.

21:48.482 --> 21:49.857
You think I'm some kind of rat,

21:49.921 --> 21:51.165
that I'm a man without honor?

21:51.182 --> 21:52.509
Then you pull the trigger.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.276
You doubt me, Bobby,

21:54.301 --> 21:55.578
you do it yourself.

22:08.983 --> 22:10.372
Fenton's back.

22:10.420 --> 22:11.446
Welcome home.

22:20.824 --> 22:21.902
Still here.

22:22.846 --> 22:23.697
What can I get you?

22:23.718 --> 22:25.142
A pint of the black stuff.

22:28.645 --> 22:29.960
Glasses in the air.

22:31.223 --> 22:33.497
Luke 15:32.

22:33.529 --> 22:35.073
What the hell kind
of a toast is that?

22:35.445 --> 22:37.062
Where'd you find
this heathen, Bobby?

22:37.307 --> 22:38.535
Didn't he ever go
to Sunday school?

22:39.499 --> 22:41.739
"We should celebrate and rejoice

22:41.818 --> 22:42.656
because..."

22:42.693 --> 22:44.579
"Because your brother
here was dead

22:45.243 --> 22:46.549
and has come to life."

22:48.026 --> 22:49.008
Welcome home.

22:49.295 --> 22:50.692
- To Fenton.
- Fenton.

22:50.728 --> 22:51.685
Slainte.

23:00.011 --> 23:01.194
What do you think of him?

23:01.525 --> 23:04.660
Doesn't matter what I think.
It's up to Bobby S.

23:04.990 --> 23:06.787
Yeah, but do you buy his story

23:07.015 --> 23:08.698
about where he's been for
the last seven years?

23:08.725 --> 23:11.244
I don't know, but I'm
gonna check it out.

23:11.639 --> 23:13.694
And if he's lying
about somethin'?

23:13.956 --> 23:15.389
Then I'll kill the bastard.

23:22.059 --> 23:23.097
So I think I figured out

23:23.121 --> 23:25.570
where Bobby S went in Yonkers.

23:25.608 --> 23:26.552
The raceway.

23:26.584 --> 23:29.521
He pulled out $500 in cash
from the ATM there.

23:29.559 --> 23:30.791
Betting on the ponies.

23:30.822 --> 23:32.181
Any security cameras
in the parking lot?

23:32.224 --> 23:34.717
Espo's checking right now,
but if we can prove

23:34.755 --> 23:36.958
that he left just before
our time-of-death window,

23:36.977 --> 23:39.736
then that should help us
nail him for the murder.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.202
Oh, no.
Thank you. I'm fine.

23:45.106 --> 23:47.212
So do we know how Ryan's doing?

23:47.286 --> 23:50.391
I don't know, and I hate
not knowing things.

23:50.653 --> 23:51.876
Okay, look. Uh...

23:52.070 --> 23:54.120
Jordan is not a
woman, all right?

23:54.148 --> 23:56.280
Then who is it?
Or rather, what is it?

23:56.312 --> 23:57.376
Why does it matter?

23:57.388 --> 23:59.199
Because, Castle,
it matters to you.

23:59.221 --> 24:01.013
Why won't you tell me?

24:04.771 --> 24:07.055
Lanie's identified the
fibers on Jimmy Whelan.

24:07.104 --> 24:10.087
They are...
wool from an Australian sheep.

24:10.151 --> 24:12.518
Ah, perhaps Bobby S
had an accomplice--

24:12.555 --> 24:14.396
a cold-blooded, murderous sheep.

24:14.422 --> 24:16.103
- That's it.
- Seriously?

24:16.140 --> 24:18.498
No, not that. This. Look.

24:18.849 --> 24:20.145
Look at the jacket he's wearing.

24:20.182 --> 24:21.695
It's leather shearling...

24:21.727 --> 24:22.548
with wool.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.892
- That ties him to the murder.
- Not so fast.

24:24.935 --> 24:26.700
There were no cameras
in the VIP parking area

24:26.718 --> 24:27.740
of the racetrack.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.873
But it turns out Bobby S
had a lucky day.

24:29.910 --> 24:32.986
His 40-to-1 long shot won.
Netted him 14 grand.

24:33.028 --> 24:34.879
And wearing the same coat.

24:34.932 --> 24:35.514
The problem is,

24:35.822 --> 24:37.466
he's filling out
his W-2G tax forms

24:37.479 --> 24:39.833
at the exact same time
that Jimmy got whacked.

24:39.865 --> 24:41.144
Then Bobby S
can't be our killer.

24:41.182 --> 24:42.127
So he was being set up.

24:42.154 --> 24:45.018
Someone borrowed Bobby S's
car, planted those fibers,

24:45.050 --> 24:47.029
all in an effort to make
him look like the killer.

24:47.055 --> 24:48.479
If someone's trying
to set Bobby S up,

24:48.612 --> 24:49.697
Ryan needs to know.

25:02.814 --> 25:05.299
You know...
it's risky meeting like this.

25:05.331 --> 25:06.810
It better be important.

25:06.877 --> 25:08.691
Bobby S didn't kill Jimmy.

25:08.905 --> 25:10.699
The real killer stole
his car and set him up.

25:10.768 --> 25:12.869
Or Bobby ordered the hit

25:12.954 --> 25:14.337
and loaned his car
to the killer.

25:14.369 --> 25:15.012
No, bro.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.413
Forensic evidence was
purposefully left behind.

25:17.626 --> 25:18.748
It's a frame.

25:18.796 --> 25:20.191
Probably someone
in his own crew.

25:21.584 --> 25:22.882
Okay. I'll keep my eyes open.

25:22.904 --> 25:24.729
What good is that
gonna do you, hmm?

25:24.756 --> 25:26.345
What good is that gonna do you
when something goes down,

25:26.369 --> 25:27.480
I'm not there to back you up?

25:27.523 --> 25:29.156
What you need to
do is walk away.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.558
I'll walk away when I'm done.

25:30.584 --> 25:31.413
What's wrong with you?

25:31.450 --> 25:33.202
You got a lot to lose, man.
You got Jenny.

25:33.217 --> 25:33.986
You're trying to start a family.

25:34.029 --> 25:36.103
I don't need you to tell
me what's at stake here.

25:37.205 --> 25:38.239
Look, man...

25:38.479 --> 25:41.603
I got invited to Bobby S's
pool game tonight.

25:41.641 --> 25:42.683
This is it.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.622
This is my shot at
getting that bible.

25:46.717 --> 25:47.700
It's not worth it, man.

25:47.718 --> 25:48.786
I'll call you when I get it.

25:52.241 --> 25:54.049
How could Bobby S
not be the killer?

25:54.102 --> 25:55.713
I heard him say he
thought Jimmy was a rat.

25:55.749 --> 25:57.061
Someone else must've
heard that, too.

25:57.098 --> 25:57.979
Someone in the crew?

25:58.012 --> 25:59.090
It has to be, right?

25:59.127 --> 26:02.015
This is bad. You can't go
to the pool game tonight.

26:02.047 --> 26:02.964
I have to go.

26:02.984 --> 26:04.582
I won't get another chance.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.351
You won't get another chance.

26:08.497 --> 26:10.177
What's the combination
to Bobby S's safe?

26:10.240 --> 26:11.030
Uh...

26:12.139 --> 26:14.510
3-0-4-2-1-7.

26:14.553 --> 26:16.046
3-0-4-2-1-7.
How do you know that?

26:16.126 --> 26:18.059
Bobby has me ring up a
total on the cash register

26:18.100 --> 26:18.809
on Friday nights.

26:18.835 --> 26:20.778
He bases the combination
on that total.

26:24.591 --> 26:25.899
We're gonna get through this.

26:34.757 --> 26:36.625
Oh, come on.
You still have this little guy?

26:37.559 --> 26:37.854
Wait.

26:37.923 --> 26:39.879
Um, what his name again?

26:39.906 --> 26:41.992
How could you forget
Mr. Whiskers?

26:42.024 --> 26:44.296
You spent over 50 bucks
trying to win him for me.

26:44.516 --> 26:45.876
That ring toss was a bitch.

26:46.505 --> 26:47.965
Well, it was worth every penny.

26:48.716 --> 26:50.911
He's seen me through
some pretty rough times.

26:53.526 --> 26:55.000
Was any of it real?

26:59.140 --> 27:00.257
What I felt was.

27:08.835 --> 27:09.664
I gotta go.

27:11.887 --> 27:12.943
Big night tonight.

27:15.749 --> 27:17.127
So the canvass at
Yonkers raceway

27:17.164 --> 27:18.298
came up with something.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.563
A parking attendant saw
Bobby S's black Charger.

27:20.803 --> 27:22.954
Now it returned 30 minutes
after the murder.

27:22.991 --> 27:24.543
He only saw it from a distance,
but he says the driver

27:24.578 --> 27:25.668
was wearing a baseball cap,

27:25.700 --> 27:27.057
and he walked to
the subway stop.

27:27.115 --> 27:29.196
- Okay, let's touch base with the MTA.
- Already did.

27:29.233 --> 27:31.915
I cross-referenced all
metrocards swiped at that time.

27:31.958 --> 27:32.972
One of 'em was bought
with a credit card,

27:33.014 --> 27:34.988
and that credit card
belonged to Liam Finch.

27:35.036 --> 27:36.470
That's Bobby S's number two.

27:36.611 --> 27:37.429
It's a coup.

27:37.467 --> 27:39.442
Liam is framing Bobby to
get him out of the way.

27:39.474 --> 27:40.467
He wants to take over.

27:40.515 --> 27:42.235
And Ryan walked right
in the middle of it.

27:42.251 --> 27:43.439
Worse.
He didn't walk in the middle.

27:43.464 --> 27:45.099
He walked in as
Bobby S's friend.

27:45.138 --> 27:46.473
That makes him Liam's enemy.

27:46.639 --> 27:47.724
Okay, we have to warn him.

27:47.762 --> 27:49.684
If we call him, we
could blow his cover.

27:49.732 --> 27:51.148
If we don't, he
could end up dead.

27:59.653 --> 28:01.209
Get the hell outta here.

28:01.487 --> 28:03.357
Since when'd you become
such a pool hustler?

28:03.395 --> 28:04.813
Just call me fast Eddie.

28:09.024 --> 28:09.623
Come here.

28:12.098 --> 28:14.359
I went over your numbers.
I can live with 'em.

28:14.428 --> 28:16.860
So how soon can you get some
of that Chicago crank up here?

28:17.262 --> 28:19.007
I can get you 5 pounds
by this weekend.

28:19.055 --> 28:19.939
Come next week,

28:19.971 --> 28:21.475
I can get you however
much you want.

28:22.669 --> 28:23.267
Love it.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.979
Take your shot, you
lucky bastard.

28:26.816 --> 28:28.634
It's Keane. Says it's urgent.

28:32.146 --> 28:33.111
Yeah, Keane.

28:33.164 --> 28:34.368
Liam, you were right.

28:34.951 --> 28:36.529
We got a rat in the house.

28:37.163 --> 28:38.289
I'll call you back.

28:43.895 --> 28:46.254
He said we got a
rat in the house.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.424
Ahh!

28:57.630 --> 28:59.602
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

29:04.811 --> 29:06.392
All right, I gotta hit the head.

29:37.945 --> 29:39.841
Tell Stevie to bring
my car around front.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.949
Hey, sport.
Been looking for you.

30:11.950 --> 30:14.750
Bobby S needs us
to take a ride.

30:15.410 --> 30:16.190
Okay. Let me get my phone.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.109
You're not gonna be needing it.

30:18.110 --> 30:21.210
Car's out back. You're driving.

30:24.060 --> 30:25.660
All right. I'll be right back.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.900
Time to go... Fenton.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.638
Ryan's still not answering.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.700
Well, if Bobby S doesn't allow
cell phones in his presence,

30:51.701 --> 30:54.189
maybe he and Ryan are
still just playing pool.

30:54.190 --> 30:55.188
What did Agent Walker say?

30:55.189 --> 30:57.630
The feds don't know any more
than we do about where Ryan is.

30:57.631 --> 31:00.089
Something's not right.

31:00.090 --> 31:04.099
Guys... is Kevin in trouble?

31:04.100 --> 31:05.129
Uh, no.

31:05.130 --> 31:07.030
We're just talking
some procedural stuff.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.590
Don't lie to me, Javi.
What's going on?

31:10.460 --> 31:11.810
Where's my husband?

31:12.610 --> 31:14.770
Jenny, maybe we should
go get a coffee.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.540
So you don't know where he is?

31:21.350 --> 31:25.009
No.
But we are going to find him.

31:25.010 --> 31:28.889
And, um, we don't believe that
he's in any immediate danger.

31:28.890 --> 31:31.070
Why would he do a
thing like this?

31:32.740 --> 31:35.359
Maybe he thinks he has
something to prove

31:35.360 --> 31:39.309
'cause of all of our...
pregnancy stuff.

31:39.310 --> 31:43.109
You know, I think that there are
probably a number of reasons,

31:43.110 --> 31:47.429
but the main one is that he just
wants to do the right thing.

31:47.430 --> 31:49.670
I mean, that's who he is,
that's why he became a cop,

31:49.671 --> 31:52.060
that's why you fell
in love with him.

31:52.420 --> 31:54.510
I just want him to come home.

31:54.770 --> 31:57.480
Hey, Beckett.
I need to talk to you.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.370
We going to the docks?

32:10.110 --> 32:11.980
Only two things to
do at the docks--

32:11.981 --> 32:13.870
kill someone or go fishing.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.109
Kinda late to be
fishing, ain't it?

32:16.110 --> 32:20.440
Yep. All the fishies are asleep.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.429
What now, huh?

32:51.430 --> 32:53.010
You know, I had my
suspicions about you

32:53.011 --> 32:55.870
from the moment you walked
into Siobhan's bar.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.669
But, no. Everybody said,
"Fenton is stand-up."

32:58.670 --> 33:01.570
Everybody vouched for
you, even Bobby S.

33:02.070 --> 33:03.829
But you still had
your doubts, huh?

33:03.830 --> 33:05.020
That's right.

33:05.140 --> 33:09.500
So I had Keane follow
you around today.

33:10.560 --> 33:15.299
You know, I knew that we
had a rat amongst us.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.710
But what I didn't figure

33:18.220 --> 33:23.280
was how that rat could
hide in plain sight.

33:38.910 --> 33:41.000
- Siobhan?
- I'm sorry.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.730
So am I, brother.

33:43.731 --> 33:46.419
Keane followed you over
to Siobhan's place.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.138
Yeah, I spoke with one
of her neighbors.

33:48.139 --> 33:50.620
Turns out she was picked up
by the cops two days ago.

33:50.621 --> 33:54.529
Being an inquisitive lad,
Keane broke in to her place.

33:54.530 --> 33:56.129
Tell him what you found, Keane.

33:56.130 --> 33:58.139
I went through her
cell phone, Fenton.

33:58.140 --> 34:00.149
Man, she's been
talking to the FBI.

34:00.150 --> 34:03.780
After all this time,
nothing but a snitch.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.740
A Judas...

34:07.870 --> 34:09.820
With an angel's face.

34:13.739 --> 34:16.879
Now, Fenton, you know me.
I'm nothing if not fair.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.902
So I'm gonna give
you a fair chance

34:17.904 --> 34:20.400
to prove you knew
nothing about this.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.330
Blow her brains out.

34:49.280 --> 34:53.560
Fenton, we're leaving with
one or two bodies tonight.

34:56.340 --> 34:57.900
It's up to you.

35:02.430 --> 35:06.290
It's okay. It's not your fault.

35:07.630 --> 35:09.350
Just do it.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.700
I just can't do it, bobby.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.160
I can't shoot her.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.130
However I have no
problem shooting you.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.839
Empty. You son of a bitch.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.869
Had to be sure, friend.

35:45.870 --> 35:48.289
And damn.
I'm so disappointed in you, Fenton.

35:48.290 --> 35:50.610
Not as disappointed as
you're about to be.

35:51.120 --> 35:54.319
My name's not Fenton.
It's Kevin Ryan,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
and I'm a cop.

35:56.920 --> 35:59.119
What? A cop?

35:59.120 --> 36:01.869
Yeah, and I'm placing the
three of you under arrest.

36:01.870 --> 36:03.469
Well, that'll be a
hell of a trick,

36:03.470 --> 36:06.059
considering Liam's about to shoot you...
and your girlfriend.

36:06.060 --> 36:07.850
Wait a second.
Liam, before you do that,

36:07.851 --> 36:11.110
let me ask you a question.
Where's your cell phone, huh?

36:11.500 --> 36:11.998
What?

36:11.999 --> 36:13.600
Remember when we tussled
back in the hall?

36:13.601 --> 36:15.119
Yeah. I picked your pocket.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.548
And then when you
weren't looking,

36:16.549 --> 36:18.380
I dialed my partner and
left the line open.

36:18.381 --> 36:19.920
No way.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.499
He heard exactly
where we were going.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.340
- Liam.
- He's full of crap, Bobby.

36:24.341 --> 36:26.449
- He's bluffing.
- Oh, am I?

36:26.450 --> 36:28.749
Why don't we meet
my partner, huh?

36:28.750 --> 36:31.060
Yo, Javi, where you at?!

36:38.550 --> 36:39.560
Right here, bro.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.870
No, no.
He is former Special Forces.

36:41.871 --> 36:44.199
You do not want to draw on him.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.909
Want to meet the
rest of my crew?

36:45.910 --> 36:47.470
Hey, Beckett!

36:47.640 --> 36:49.169
You called, Ryan?

36:49.170 --> 36:50.709
Don't let the looks
fool you, boys.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.530
You don't want to mess
with her, either.

36:52.531 --> 36:54.000
Castle!

36:54.860 --> 36:58.380
Seriously? I didn't...
I didn't bring my vest.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.970
Drop your weapons. Now.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.889
I got the best
lawyer in New York.

37:13.890 --> 37:15.540
I'm gonna walk.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.060
Not when I hand the feds this.

37:33.470 --> 37:36.760
Snazzy 3-piece suit could
only mean one thing...

37:37.350 --> 37:38.579
Ryan is back.

37:38.580 --> 37:40.610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:41.820 --> 37:42.928
So where are we with Liam?

37:42.929 --> 37:44.838
Beckett's got him in the box,
trying to get him to confess

37:44.839 --> 37:45.860
to Jimmy Whelan's murder.

37:45.861 --> 37:49.339
And Agent Walker called.
He said the bible you gave him is gold.

37:49.340 --> 37:51.370
Bobby S and his whole crew
are doing down.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.739
And, uh, Javi...

37:53.740 --> 37:55.010
The other day at the diner--

37:55.011 --> 37:57.119
Don't sweat it.
That wasn't you talkin', man.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.400
That was Fenton.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.369
Yeah. Thanks.

38:00.370 --> 38:04.399
You guys aren't gonna believe
this, but Liam is not our killer.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.348
What are you talking about?
It was his metrocard.

38:06.349 --> 38:08.098
He paid for it with
his own credit card,

38:08.099 --> 38:10.100
and then he swiped it after
he dropped off Bobby S's car.

38:10.101 --> 38:12.519
I know, but his alibi is solid.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.510
He was on Staten
Island at that time.

38:14.511 --> 38:16.639
Okay, well, if he
has a solid alibi,

38:16.640 --> 38:18.489
the only question
that remains is,

38:18.490 --> 38:20.720
who had access to his metrocard?

38:22.330 --> 38:23.879
Maggie...

38:23.880 --> 38:27.049
You know, I pegged you for a
lot of things, never a killer.

38:27.050 --> 38:29.719
Yeah, I pegged you for a lot
of things, but never a narc.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.909
Actually, see, I'm a
homicide detective,

38:31.910 --> 38:34.530
which is why I know that you
killed Jimmy the baker.

38:34.900 --> 38:35.810
Jimmy the who?

38:35.811 --> 38:38.040
Oh, god. Are we actually
gonna play this game?

38:38.050 --> 38:39.589
It's late. I am tired.

38:39.590 --> 38:42.339
Officers went through your house,
and they found your gun.

38:42.340 --> 38:44.530
Same caliber that killed Jimmy.

38:44.940 --> 38:47.670
It's only a matter of time before
we get a ballistics match.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.000
So Liam had no idea what
his wife was doing?

38:51.001 --> 38:53.099
No, it was all Maggie.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.739
She knew that Liam
was too loyal,

38:54.740 --> 38:57.769
and she figured that if she
could get Bobby S in prison,

38:57.770 --> 39:00.539
her husband would
ascend to the throne.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.969
So really, Lady Maggie
was Lady Macbeth,

39:02.970 --> 39:05.400
only she was Irish,
not Scottish.

39:08.330 --> 39:10.289
Listen, Kate, about Jordan...

39:10.290 --> 39:12.050
You know what? If, uh, if you
don't want to talk about it--

39:12.051 --> 39:14.939
No, I-I-I wanna, but...

39:14.940 --> 39:17.699
What happens if you don't
like what you see?

39:17.700 --> 39:19.840
What happens if you
don't let me look?

39:23.190 --> 39:27.699
Jordan Motor Company.
They made cars from 1916 to 1931.

39:27.700 --> 39:31.769
That's Jordan? That's the big
secret, a defunct car company?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.649
Sort of. It goes back to
my boarding school days.

39:34.650 --> 39:37.989
My first semester there, I was
in danger of flunking out.

39:37.990 --> 39:41.399
I needed an "A"
on my term paper.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.190
So you wrote the paper
on that car company?

39:43.191 --> 39:47.290
No. Someone else did,

39:47.700 --> 39:50.099
and I paid him $250.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.979
Um, Castle, that happened
when you were a kid.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.999
I don't understand why that
would change how I see you.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.530
Because it changed
how I saw myself.

39:59.210 --> 40:01.729
The teacher read the paper
to the entire class

40:01.730 --> 40:05.299
as an example of great
writing, and they applauded.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.169
It was the first time I was
celebrated ev--for anything,

40:08.170 --> 40:10.419
and... it was a fraud.

40:10.420 --> 40:14.300
I... I was a fraud.

40:14.940 --> 40:16.820
That's when I learned
how to write.

40:16.821 --> 40:18.529
I wrote and wrote,

40:18.530 --> 40:22.060
trying to be as great as
everyone thought I was...

40:22.880 --> 40:26.040
Trying to earn that applause.

40:27.860 --> 40:30.069
I'm still trying.

40:30.070 --> 40:32.990
You're right, Castle.
It does change how I see you.

40:35.810 --> 40:38.360
It makes me like you
just a little bit more.

40:48.890 --> 40:50.960
Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.980
Oh, so now you
remember his name.

40:54.770 --> 40:56.800
Could you give us
a second, please?

40:58.320 --> 41:00.400
I was hoping you'd come.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.720
I wanted to say
good-bye this time.

41:04.750 --> 41:07.599
"Good-bye" makes me feel like
I'll never see you again.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.240
You won't.

41:10.710 --> 41:14.350
Tomorrow you'll be in a new
city, have a new name.

41:14.550 --> 41:17.120
You'll get to start over again.

41:17.230 --> 41:21.250
Why'd you do this,
risk your life for me?

41:23.010 --> 41:24.670
You know why.

41:27.420 --> 41:29.750
This Kevin Ryan guy,

41:30.170 --> 41:32.210
I wish I would've
met him sooner.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.760
I'm sorry, Jenny.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.600
I know it wasn't fair to you.

41:58.601 --> 42:00.450
Just tell me the truth.

42:00.700 --> 42:04.800
Is this part of your life,
this undercover part, over?

42:05.410 --> 42:07.619
- Yeah, it is now.
- Good.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.449
Because I need to know
that you're gonna be here.

42:11.450 --> 42:14.890
A-and I need to know that
I can depend on you,

42:15.240 --> 42:16.597
especially after
the test results

42:16.598 --> 42:18.590
we got back from the
fertility doctor.

42:18.591 --> 42:20.469
- Oh, no. Bad news?
- Yeah.

42:20.470 --> 42:23.420
We took all those damn
tests for nothing.

42:25.620 --> 42:27.890
I'm already pregnant.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.850
You're pregnant?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.320
You're pregnant.

42:38.770 --> 42:40.709
Let's, uh, let's pop
some champagne.

42:40.710 --> 42:42.679
No. No, We-we can't pop
any champagne.

42:42.680 --> 42:43.939
Do you know why?
Because...

42:43.940 --> 42:45.457
- you're pregnant.
- I'm pregnant.
