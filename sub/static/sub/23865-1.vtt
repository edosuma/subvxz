00:26.290 --> 00:31.760
December

00:27.570 --> 00:30.860
Adults often said that I sleep on the go.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.750
Hey! Where are you going?

00:41.370 --> 00:44.820
Please take me and my package to the city.

00:45.130 --> 00:48.420
Usually it is carried by my brother, but he has a cold.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.950
I'm here instead of... him...

00:53.370 --> 00:54.940
That's it...

00:54.940 --> 00:59.530
Don't sit like that, there's scattered gravel everywhere.

00:59.880 --> 01:04.620
First I'll take the nori, then I'll buy stuff for my brother and sister and go home.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.420
Yeah...

01:19.240 --> 01:20.540
Look.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.970
Here we are.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.220
Oh! Don't sleep on the go.

01:43.370 --> 01:47.670
Chocolate "Morinaga"

01:47.670 --> 01:49.710
New Year's sale in Hiroshima

01:54.570 --> 01:56.240
Chocolate - 10 yen.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.260
A large packet of caramel - 10 yen, small - 5 yen.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.880
Yo-yo - 10 yen.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.310
So, pull, pull.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.170
Look at this.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.000
Come in, please.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.240
Thank you very much.

Corner of
the World

03:50.200 --> 03:52.590
I lost my way in the city.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.510
Then I saw an uncle with a basket.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.330
Suzu, who is this?

04:01.550 --> 04:02.370
The monster.

04:02.550 --> 04:03.150
Eh?

04:03.600 --> 04:08.910
He said to me: "Climb up and look into your telescope".

04:11.110 --> 04:13.910
How well you can see!

04:16.350 --> 04:19.800
I fell inward, and there was an unfamiliar boy.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.910
He steals children, and he also stole me.

04:25.660 --> 04:27.240
That's bad.

04:27.730 --> 04:31.600
I need to return by evening to feed the chickens.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.350
I also need to see my father at the station.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.060
Me too, me too...

04:37.370 --> 04:41.260
If I don't get there before sunset, trouble will happen to me.

04:41.370 --> 04:43.460
What's the trouble with him?

04:43.460 --> 04:45.080
Now, see for yourself.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.350
Uncle, uncle.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.860
Aw, what?

04:53.660 --> 04:56.570
There's something strange, just look.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.860
And where is that?

05:04.220 --> 05:07.420
At night, the monsters sleep soundly.

05:08.710 --> 05:11.240
We're leaving him without dinner, poor fellow.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.240
Thanks, Urano Suzu.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.860
Oh, how do you know my name?

05:20.170 --> 05:21.910
Thanks, Urano Suzu.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.990
Hey, stop making noise!

05:26.130 --> 05:28.000
Maybe I was sleeping on the go.

05:28.440 --> 05:33.310
But everything that happened that day was like a dream.

05:35.640 --> 05:42.650
August

05:39.370 --> 05:41.820
Usually the sea looks like this.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.570
And at low tide it becomes like that.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.420
For the first time, we're going to the sea without adults. That's great!

05:51.860 --> 05:56.170
I'll say "Good morning, uncle, aunt and grandmother from Kusatsu."

05:56.710 --> 05:59.930
And mom and dad will be back in town.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.320
"Here's your watermelon."

06:01.580 --> 06:04.780
Ah! Give it to me, I want to carry it!

06:04.910 --> 06:05.530
Quiet!

06:07.220 --> 06:09.170
Here, it's your turn to carry it.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.150
My brother is always strict.

06:12.510 --> 06:13.530
Wait...

06:15.480 --> 06:17.000
Good morning.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.840
Dad and Mom...

06:23.750 --> 06:25.350
Here... the watermelon...

06:25.350 --> 06:27.910
Thanks, I'll take it away.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.060
Our little beauty.

06:31.420 --> 06:36.460
Every year my grandmother sews a new kimono for me.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.170
Here we are.

06:36.950 --> 06:41.240
Mom and Dad returned from the city with shopping and we went to the cemetery.

06:37.710 --> 06:40.910
The weather is good.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.840
What's going on now in Eba?

06:45.950 --> 06:49.350
Well, times are not all that simple.

06:49.350 --> 06:50.530
And that's right...

06:57.060 --> 06:58.510
Lot of things happened.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.660
But we children seemed to be fearless at the time.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.760
Even when seeing something unusual.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.020
Good afternoon.

07:33.620 --> 07:38.840
Say... do you want me to get more watermelon?

07:42.680 --> 07:44.060
Mom.

07:46.820 --> 07:49.710
Hey, the tide's going to be over soon.

07:50.660 --> 07:51.950
Come on, wake up.

07:53.150 --> 07:55.040
And you too, Sumi.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.240
Come on.

07:59.170 --> 08:02.550
Put it in the corner, she'll eat it.

08:03.280 --> 08:08.770
Uh-huh, tell me... if you leave her a kimono, will she dress?

08:09.800 --> 08:13.440
Suzu, you're a kind girl.

08:13.750 --> 08:18.620
They mentioned in school that it was a Zashiki-warashi house spirit.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.370
My brother explained everything to me.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.880
It seemed that both people and nature became a little kinder.

08:27.130 --> 08:29.600
You left a new kimono in Kusatsu?

08:29.600 --> 08:32.730
Go take it back. Idiot!

08:33.340 --> 08:35.480
My brother is the devil himself.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.350
I forgot how terrible my brother was.

08:39.330 --> 08:44.000
February

08:43.460 --> 08:45.420
Suzu, lower it further!

08:45.910 --> 08:47.330
It's not going to blow in the wind.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.220
Uh-huh.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.710
Mom, give me a couple yen.

08:51.970 --> 08:53.510
My pencil's out.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.310
You always buy one when you have money.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.020
And you draw nothing but horrible stuff.

09:01.970 --> 09:04.600
Sumi, want to exchange pencils?

09:04.600 --> 09:05.240
Nope.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.950
Suzu, is Mizuhara Tetsu at school every day?

09:09.240 --> 09:10.840
Eh? I think so...

09:16.530 --> 09:18.280
It's cold!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.020
It's so short.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.750
Is it enough for a whole week?

09:44.060 --> 09:46.260
Look, you shouldn't drop it there.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.930
A drawing lesson on a free topic.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.770
Those who are done can go home.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
Yes!

09:55.880 --> 09:57.640
Let's draw over here.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.240
Hmm, not bad.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.080
Good work, Urano.

10:03.550 --> 10:05.620
Suzu is such an artist.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.170
I came back!

10:12.460 --> 10:14.660
I'll go and collect some dry needles.

10:14.950 --> 10:16.040
Be safe.

10:34.880 --> 10:40.310
Mizuhara, you won't go home until you finish your picture?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.600
Go home?

10:42.550 --> 10:46.080
My parents drink all day, they don't even collect nori.

10:46.710 --> 10:49.680
I don't want to draw the sea... I hate it.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.660
Urano, reach out your hand.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.370
This is for you.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.950
Can I take it?

11:01.310 --> 11:04.060
Take it, it's my brother's pencil.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.350
The rabbits are jumping.

11:06.930 --> 11:10.280
When they rolled over, everything was the same.

11:11.130 --> 11:14.820
Draw me something, even though this is a stupid sea.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.150
Mizuhara, what kind of rabbits are these?

11:21.350 --> 11:22.020
What?

11:22.600 --> 11:26.880
Ah... the foam on the waves is similar to white rabbits.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.460
Mizuhara, take my brother.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.310
Don't want him.

11:32.260 --> 11:36.680
We have a rule: we see your brother, we run without looking back.

11:38.970 --> 11:45.710
Although, still... he, at least, isn't such a fool to go study to become a sailor and immediately drown.

11:46.880 --> 11:50.600
You know, they really look like rabbits.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.110
Done.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.640
I got your needles.

11:55.770 --> 11:56.930
Thank you.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.570
Something good happened.

12:01.350 --> 12:04.000
Of course, now you can go home.

12:04.910 --> 12:08.480
But such a sea... it's hard to even hate it.

12:13.830 --> 12:17.380
March

12:15.330 --> 12:19.760
The Imperial Navy is fighting bravely in the eastern waters of the Pacific...

12:16.710 --> 12:20.260
December

12:19.460 --> 12:23.750
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

12:19.760 --> 12:25.260
April

12:20.090 --> 12:23.320
Urano Suzu

12:20.090 --> 12:23.320
Bloody brother is in the army

12:25.300 --> 12:29.810
December

12:25.480 --> 12:28.950
Look at that, Morita's niece is already gathering.

12:29.170 --> 12:30.020
Exactly.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.970
What a wonderful outfit you have.

12:51.950 --> 12:56.260
You're doing good. Come, I made dinner.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.260
I'm coming!

13:01.510 --> 13:04.240
Suzu will find her husband far from here.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.680
Right?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.680
And for Sumi, someone close.

13:07.910 --> 13:13.350
Like a girl holding sticks, your new house will be so close.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.060
Granny, are you from afar?

13:18.200 --> 13:20.930
I was born in Furue.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.110
So it's nothing from Furue to Kusatsu.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.770
Think of the people that are getting married in Manchuria or some other places.

13:27.860 --> 13:31.730
Even after saying this, Urano Sumi later moved far from home.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.730
It's not interesting to live very closely.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.910
Suzu, hurry up back home.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.480
We got a phone call.

13:42.480 --> 13:48.550
They said that a man came to your house who wants to marry you. Straight from Kure.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.400
From Kure?

13:49.730 --> 13:53.130
Suzu, how old are you?

13:53.130 --> 13:57.240
Nineteen... no, eighteen.

13:57.750 --> 14:01.750
You can refuse if you don't like it, but go see him first.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.220
Suzu, come with me.

14:05.800 --> 14:11.240
I kept waiting for that day to come.
I made something for you.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.860
In it, you'll look like a princess.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.060
Thank you.

14:19.330 --> 14:23.620
The wedding ceremony will be at the groom's house.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.170
Yes...

14:25.170 --> 14:30.020
And in the evening he will ask you: "Have you taken an umbrella with you?".

14:31.280 --> 14:35.840
You will answer: "Yes, I took one, completely new."

14:36.510 --> 14:39.970
He will say: "Can I take it?".

14:39.970 --> 14:42.330
And you tell him: "Take it."

14:42.860 --> 14:43.950
What for?

14:44.350 --> 14:45.310
For everything.

14:45.570 --> 14:47.840
So, I become an adult.

14:48.750 --> 14:55.110
Once in Kure... there's a big military port there... and there's a lot of sailors...

15:00.930 --> 15:01.910
Mizuhara?

15:04.150 --> 15:05.330
Long-time no see...

15:05.600 --> 15:07.040
Get home already.

15:07.110 --> 15:07.640
Eh?

15:08.000 --> 15:12.800
Your mother made such a mess, all the neighbors know.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.950
Oh, I was so scared. I really thought they were giving me away to you.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.150
Are you a fool?

15:20.620 --> 15:24.460
I went to my brother's funeral.
He drowned seven years ago.

15:26.930 --> 15:29.600
So you don't know who he is?

15:30.170 --> 15:31.080
Not at all.

15:31.770 --> 15:34.280
Maybe I got confused with Sumi.

15:35.150 --> 15:37.600
She will be more beautiful.

15:38.350 --> 15:40.680
Or maybe not.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.770
It seems that he met her somewhere when he was studying at a local school.

15:48.020 --> 15:50.930
But it wasn't easy to find you.

15:51.220 --> 15:56.840
Three years ago I decided to stop collecting nori and went to work at the factory.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.480
She will come back soon.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.350
I don't know if it's good or bad.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.260
Help yourself.

16:04.570 --> 16:08.240
I had some kind of caramel taste in my mouth.

16:08.370 --> 16:09.800
I don't know why.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.510
It's really cold.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.930
It's a mess.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.420
I can refuse if I want to.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.880
But how can I decide if I don't know him at all...

16:20.880 --> 16:22.060
Sorry to intrude.

16:23.170 --> 16:23.820
Yes?

16:25.930 --> 16:28.080
We got lost in the city.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.020
Where is the train stop?

16:30.510 --> 16:31.420
Over there.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.550
Forgive us.

16:32.730 --> 16:36.080
A young sailor already showed us the way.

16:36.530 --> 16:40.510
Ah, it's a little weird here.

16:40.680 --> 16:45.240
They got lost in the mountains, but a little strange woman helped them out.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.610
February

16:49.750 --> 16:53.110
Why am I so confused?

16:51.070 --> 16:53.570
Hiroshima

16:54.360 --> 16:56.990
Hiroshima

16:54.550 --> 16:57.600
When did I become so?

16:56.450 --> 16:59.410
Kaitaichi

16:58.950 --> 17:01.620
Yano

17:01.120 --> 17:03.870
Saka

17:03.000 --> 17:05.210
Coyaura

17:07.710 --> 17:08.839
It was a long trip.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.819
The train will enter the tunnel, close all the windows.

17:23.280 --> 17:24.800
It's hard to breathe.

17:29.310 --> 17:33.040
Kure! Kure!

17:34.660 --> 17:37.220
This is the training fleet.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.280
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.530
Is the bus broken again?

17:59.910 --> 18:01.570
Oh, Mrs. Kobayashi.

18:00.970 --> 18:04.000
Welcome, Mrs. Kobayashi.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.350
The weather is good today.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.930
All that matters is that everyone is healthy.

18:10.060 --> 18:12.080
From now on, I'll be grateful to you.

18:12.570 --> 18:15.080
I beg your indulgence for my foolishness.

18:15.080 --> 18:20.020
I'm Kobayashi, the groom's aunt.
I'll be a matchmaker at the ceremony.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.480
She did not even remember the name of the groom.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.440
This unreasonableness frightens me.

18:32.420 --> 18:36.550
Oh, how high they we climb.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.000
It seems their house is above all others.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.370
This way, please.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.260
HOUJO

18:41.170 --> 18:43.020
They're here!

18:43.400 --> 18:46.460
Forgive me that the ceremony is so modest and not crowded.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.280
It's ok, my daughter is very shy, it's even better.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.170
Suzu.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.350
In fact, I wonder why I dressed in this kimono.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.530
Why are you undressing, Suzu?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.020
This is a feast.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.000
It's a pity that our elder son could not come.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.420
Now it's hard to get together.

19:13.420 --> 19:17.640
Thank you for bringing so many nori and vegetables with you.

19:13.800 --> 19:18.860
Eat more. We must all eat without fail until the evening.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.710
And the roast is also very tasty.

19:22.770 --> 19:26.020
Lucky for you, he's such a quiet guy.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.600
I think there's not a single troublemaker in the whole house.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.420
Unless you become one.

19:28.860 --> 19:31.110
Don't forget us, come visit.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.330
Be happy with your stay!!

19:34.460 --> 19:36.400
Bye!

19:38.330 --> 19:39.600
I'll be back.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.080
Err.. who is she?

19:48.280 --> 19:53.570
Well, she's someone that will help with the household chores so you can rest more.

19:53.570 --> 19:54.280
Yes.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.000
Mother, father.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.370
From now on, I will be gracious to you.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.750
We're happy, too.

20:03.020 --> 20:08.240
My legs hurt, thanks for the help, Suzu.

20:08.860 --> 20:09.350
Of course.

20:10.730 --> 20:14.750
I'm sorry. When Keiko cooks, she burns everything.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.420
Yeah, she's his married older sister.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.660
It's lighting from the training ships.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.510
Where is mom and dad now?

20:51.530 --> 20:54.730
Thanks for the futon.

20:55.220 --> 20:55.930
Uh-huh.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.800
Oh, Suzu...

21:02.370 --> 21:02.970
What?

21:04.150 --> 21:06.350
Did you took an umbrella?

21:10.680 --> 21:14.530
Yes. I absolutely did... a new one...

21:15.530 --> 21:17.130
Can I take it?

21:24.530 --> 21:25.240
Here you go.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.080
Hungry?

21:33.110 --> 21:35.130
Well, it's not ripe yet.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.420
You have not eaten anything for a day.

21:40.220 --> 21:43.240
You do eat with your mouth, like everyone else. It's calming.

21:45.110 --> 21:46.710
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

21:46.710 --> 21:50.040
I drink like everyone else. Also with my mouth.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.860
Listen, have we seen each other before?

21:57.620 --> 22:00.420
Have we seen? You don't remember?

22:00.600 --> 22:04.570
Sorry, I'm a little distracted.

22:04.570 --> 22:06.420
It was a long time ago.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.480
But I remember this birthmark well.

22:44.770 --> 22:49.260
We collect water from a common well nearby.

Shūsaku was in the fourth grade when they ceased to build warships after the peace conference.

25:50.860 --> 25:56.880
My husband, like many others, lost his job.

25:57.370 --> 26:03.750

Okay, I'll try not to give it up.

Welcome back, sister.

26:36.750 --> 26:37.510
Shame.

I'm talking about you!

26:46.160 --> 26:47.570
You're from Hiroshima, are you not?

26:47.570 --> 26:49.690
I thought you had some taste.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.730
So what are these patched pants?

26:53.260 --> 26:54.950
Are you grilling beans?

26:53.280 --> 27:01.060
Girls should dress decently. Are not you ashamed of yourself?

26:55.170 --> 26:57.910
Oh, welcome back, Harumi.

26:57.910 --> 27:02.750
Although I obeyed, Mom was angry all day for some reason.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.330

27:06.330 --> 27:07.550
So take it!

27:11.930 --> 27:16.040
And the rice in that sack is not a gift. It's my and Harumi's share.

27:19.860 --> 27:21.440

Yes, well, I tried.

27:26.400 --> 27:26.930
Ouch!

27:27.420 --> 27:29.840
Well, again. No, not like that.

27:30.020 --> 27:33.440

27:33.680 --> 27:35.440
Well, it's not really necessary.

27:42.570 --> 27:45.910

27:47.260 --> 27:48.420
Yeah, I see.

Is this okay?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.240
Wow.

28:46.170 --> 28:48.130
Suzu, are you leaving?

28:48.170 --> 28:49.730
Yes, for the distribution.

28:50.370 --> 28:53.930
I will go myself, give me the purse and the card.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.600
Okay, be safe.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.420
Welcome back.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.640
Enough, let me do it.

29:20.970 --> 29:21.640
Eh?

29:28.970 --> 29:31.110
Listen, Mom!

29:33.510 --> 29:35.950
Yes, yes, what do you want...

29:35.950 --> 29:37.880
Where are all the pots?

29:56.130 --> 29:59.150
Oh, Keiko and Harumi came back.

29:59.370 --> 30:00.110
Together?

30:00.530 --> 30:01.930
Welcome back, Dad.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.730
Well, have a good rest.

30:05.770 --> 30:10.420
Wow... My sister cooked, but nothing burned out.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.710
Listen, Shūsaku!

30:12.730 --> 30:18.460
You know, sister told me how to sew a new kimono.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.340
It's nothing.

30:21.740 --> 30:24.150
My mother has aching legs.

30:24.480 --> 30:28.220
A girl like you probably doesn't know how to help.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.130
I'll stay here for a while.

30:33.310 --> 30:36.950
Suzu, don't you want to go to Hiroshima?

30:38.330 --> 30:38.750
Eh?

30:39.620 --> 30:40.880
That's okay.

30:46.030 --> 30:48.010
The castle of Hiroshima. Urano Suzu.

30:46.310 --> 30:47.730
I'm home.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.730
Oh, I'm tired.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.040
Welcome back.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.620
It's eight already.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.620
There was a lot of work.

30:57.060 --> 30:58.840
Is that belt a "sennninbari"?
(千人針 thousand-person-stitches belt)

30:58.840 --> 31:01.510
Yes. Sumi, will you also make a stitch?

31:01.550 --> 31:02.370
Yes.

31:03.130 --> 31:05.420
Hey, Suzu, it's time to wake up!

31:05.800 --> 31:06.970
Y..yes!

31:09.370 --> 31:10.860
Here, sit down and have supper.

31:11.930 --> 31:17.150
Oh, I dreamed that I got married and left for Kure.

31:18.770 --> 31:20.510
Are you awake now?

31:19.660 --> 31:20.370
Yes.

31:20.860 --> 31:25.000
Well, my husband's sister said, "go to Hiroshima."

31:26.060 --> 31:28.110
I don't quite understand why.

31:28.510 --> 31:30.510
Ah! To visit?

31:30.710 --> 31:35.800
And, mom and dad, you said to me, "we're so sorry that we haven't noticed so far."

31:36.880 --> 31:41.550
"Go, stay two or three days with your relatives," his sister said.

31:41.820 --> 31:45.910
If you want to go, we don't mind.

31:46.970 --> 31:49.550
Did you write to Yoichi in the army?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.110
Yeah, I wrote.

31:51.420 --> 31:55.840
But no answer... it didn't come.

31:58.660 --> 32:00.060
They are far away.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.080
And they probably are not up to it.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.750
Most likely the address was confused.

32:06.710 --> 32:08.750
Bath! Bath!

32:08.880 --> 32:11.020
Sumi, is it hard to be a volunteer?

32:11.020 --> 32:12.600
I got used to it already.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.880
All the engines stinks of oil.

32:15.260 --> 32:18.130
Dangerous work is terrible.

32:18.370 --> 32:23.040
It's not as cold as the nori harvesting, and there are good sides.

32:23.220 --> 32:27.880
A nice lieutenant sometimes secretly
gives me coupons for lunch.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.000
Oh, Wicked.

32:29.150 --> 32:31.930
Be careful not to hear any military secrets inadvertently.

32:32.260 --> 32:35.660
Suzu, how are you coping?
Is Kure a good place?

32:37.480 --> 32:39.840
I'm still just sorting it out.

32:41.640 --> 32:48.330
I think I just found out a very important military secret.

32:48.330 --> 32:49.420
What are you talking about?

32:49.420 --> 32:50.310
Good night.

32:52.550 --> 32:53.620
Suzu.

32:53.620 --> 32:54.440
What?

32:55.330 --> 32:57.840
You have a bald spot.

32:57.840 --> 32:58.420
What!?

33:00.200 --> 33:03.280
Bye Suzu, I'm going to work!

33:04.020 --> 33:06.040
Victory requires special measures.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.570
Starting next month, even short trips will be limited.

33:10.260 --> 33:11.260
Take care of yourself.

33:12.640 --> 33:15.600
Well, I have a job in the women's association.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.570
What? You work too?

33:33.370 --> 33:36.420
Dad gave me some money.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.420
Farewell.

34:11.330 --> 34:12.969
Farewell, Hiroshima.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.719
To date, all tickets  SOLD

34:17.719 --> 34:19.719
Hiroshima Station

34:19.280 --> 34:21.400
And you came back here?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.860
I already sympathize with your new family.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.350
I'm back.

34:35.210 --> 34:41.300
April

34:36.460 --> 34:38.860
His sister still lives with us.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.929
Mom, give me an inkwell.

34:46.260 --> 34:47.750
I'm not going to, Harumi.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.260
Give me.

34:50.550 --> 34:54.150
Suzu, what did you say to Harumi?

34:55.909 --> 34:59.040
Can I pass the board on?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.280
Take it.

35:01.730 --> 35:02.950
I'm going.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.840
She has been like that since she came back from Hiroshima.

35:07.310 --> 35:09.370
It's nothing, she's just being childish.

35:09.370 --> 35:11.840
Thank you for your concern.

35:12.640 --> 35:13.730
Well give me.

35:13.730 --> 35:15.280
I clearly said no.

35:15.510 --> 35:16.950
Please.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.750
You don't need it!

35:44.150 --> 35:45.440
Welcome back.

35:47.150 --> 35:49.020
Field grass?

35:49.260 --> 35:52.750
Yes. It can be added to the food.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.350
Here, all the dandelions are white.

35:58.020 --> 35:59.660
And they are not in Eba?

36:00.440 --> 36:02.750
Oh, that one is still yellow.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.550
It must have been brought from afar.

36:09.840 --> 36:14.480
I wondered why you were so down.
Did you fall in love in Hiroshima?

36:14.750 --> 36:15.820
Not at all.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.060
Look! There!

36:24.330 --> 36:26.060
The aircraft carriers arrived today.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.530
Ship and carriers, I guess.

36:28.530 --> 36:29.710
The big ones.

36:31.150 --> 36:33.350
And these small ships are destroyers.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.880
There are also submarines from Germany.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.400
And similar to an ordinary ship, their mother ship.

36:44.420 --> 36:46.150
Oh, the dandelion's seed are flying.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.080
Where?

36:47.260 --> 36:49.000
Yes, over there.

36:49.730 --> 36:50.710
I can see for myself.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.220
Shūsaku, what is this?

36:56.680 --> 36:58.330
Is it a ship?

36:58.600 --> 36:59.770
It's the Yamato.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.330
The largest warship in the world, built in our local port.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.800
And there are people on it?

37:08.220 --> 37:09.060
Yes.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.970
There's a team of two thousand seven hundred.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.770
Two thousand seven hundred people?

37:20.350 --> 37:21.350
Exactly.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.220
Tell her "welcome home", Suzu.

37:26.680 --> 37:31.130
Does someone cook food for all these people every day?

37:31.020 --> 37:31.710
Suzu.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.710
And more laundry...

37:37.840 --> 37:39.130
I'm sorry.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.800
You didn't hurt yourself?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.570
No, I think I'm okay.

37:53.510 --> 37:57.950
You know, Suzu, if you're too nervous, you'll grow bald faster.

37:58.220 --> 37:59.840
You noticed.

38:00.240 --> 38:05.260
Please, let me paint Suzu's bald spot.

38:05.370 --> 38:09.260
If I give it to you, you'll be covered in ink from head to toe.

38:11.640 --> 38:15.310
And then his sister returned to her husband's house.

38:15.660 --> 38:18.060
It's time for me to cook dinner.

38:18.670 --> 38:22.670
Today
Everything's
sold out.

38:18.670 --> 38:22.670
Do the
queue
again.

38:18.670 --> 38:22.670
Confidence
in getting some
can't be bought
with money.

38:18.670 --> 38:22.670
We don't know
when new arrival
will happen.

38:18.820 --> 38:21.950
There are less and less products being distributed.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.980
May

38:23.240 --> 38:27.370
Only four sardines per family of four.

38:28.510 --> 38:29.460
Mom!

38:28.620 --> 38:31.040
But at least I can add something to the usual greens.

38:31.460 --> 38:34.530
It's necessary to do the queue to buy soybean pulp.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.710
Ah, I see.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.370
Violet, stellaria, horsetail.

38:42.910 --> 38:47.020
Dandelion, sourdough, dried sardines, soybean pulp.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.930
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, wheat flour, plum seeds.

38:53.660 --> 38:55.510
Cut the sweet potatoes.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.930
Macerate the leaves in boiling water.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.280
Mix them with wheat flour and put everything together.

39:04.460 --> 39:06.110
And dinner is ready.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.600
Without Keiko around, it's so quiet.

39:08.820 --> 39:11.060
What's not eaten, you can dry it.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.040
So, let's continue.

39:14.550 --> 39:18.060
Fill rice with five times the volume of water and cook the porridge.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.080
Add the pieces of potatoes and cook for another 10 minutes.

39:22.970 --> 39:25.020
Now we put the leaves of the stellaria.

39:25.620 --> 39:28.530
We cut the daikon and dandelion root.

39:28.530 --> 39:31.110
Fry them with sugar and soy sauce.

39:31.910 --> 39:36.640
We add dandelion leaves and soybean pulp. A little more frying.

39:38.510 --> 39:42.510
Cover with the remaining daikon, add some leaves and salt.

39:44.220 --> 39:47.800
Pour water in miso-nabe, add the plum seeds and boil it.

39:48.020 --> 39:52.440
Add the sardines to make a broth and don't put the lid.

39:52.710 --> 39:54.800
Add salt to taste.

39:54.860 --> 39:58.220
That's great. Did Karia teach you that?

39:58.220 --> 40:00.550
The ration of rice was reduced by half.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.800
We'll eat porridge from sweet potatoes.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.600
Okay.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.950
Tomorrow I will prepare something interesting again.

40:06.600 --> 40:12.880
The loyal Kusunoki, when resisting at the gate, came up with ways to make the rice reserve last longer.

40:14.460 --> 40:17.280
First fry the rice well.

40:18.220 --> 40:22.200
Add a three-fold portion of water and simmer on a small fire.

40:23.770 --> 40:27.110
To save rice and not to waste firewood for nothing,

40:27.770 --> 40:32.860
Trust his great Japanese invention: a fireless cooker.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.310
We wait till tomorrow.

40:38.110 --> 40:43.570
We warm up yesterday's fish broth, add violet and miso.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.400
In the morning we stoke the fire and finish the rice.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.000
It's ready!

40:49.640 --> 40:52.880
The famous Kusunoki Masashige rice!

40:53.840 --> 40:56.040
I filled Dad's bento with it.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.930
Wow, what a big portion today.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.530
The rice is all swollen.

41:02.770 --> 41:05.150
Is there really such a way of cooking?

41:05.150 --> 41:05.820
Yes.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.820
We're going to eat.

41:18.150 --> 41:19.170
We are going.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.660
Sorry to see you go.

41:19.750 --> 41:25.820
If Kusunoki ate this voluntarily, he really was a great hero.

41:26.420 --> 41:28.130
Probably...

41:28.340 --> 41:33.090
June

41:30.280 --> 41:34.080
Air alarm!

41:35.310 --> 41:38.480
Air alarm!

41:45.080 --> 41:47.080
There's nothing on the radio.

41:47.350 --> 41:49.710
Is Shūsaku still at work?

41:50.020 --> 41:50.600
Yes.

41:50.600 --> 41:56.080
But if you think from the enemy's way of view, it's logical to start bombing Kyūshū.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.440
There's no point hitting here in the mountains.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.280
They just turned off the lights.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.330
Be careful up there.

42:08.110 --> 42:10.200
They should remove those houses.

42:10.950 --> 42:13.750
The city needs a fire wall.

42:13.750 --> 42:14.550
Right.

42:14.770 --> 42:17.480
But we'll definitely not do it.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.460
Poor things.

42:19.910 --> 42:22.420
They will have to look for a new home.

42:23.710 --> 42:24.550
Thank you.

42:25.730 --> 42:27.080
It's my pleasure.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.370
There will be plenty of firewood.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.420
Because my house was wrecked.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.730
That's bad.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.910
He had to go to Simonoseki.

42:38.910 --> 42:40.910
This is not a good thing, I am directly divorced.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.060
Don't worry, I'll find a job and I will not be a freeloader.

42:46.970 --> 42:49.750
It should be taken into account that there is more people around now.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.730
Will that do?

42:51.730 --> 42:52.750
Yeah.

42:53.630 --> 42:58.380
July

42:57.710 --> 43:00.680
Yesterday they fired from the
very top of the Hagamine mountain.

43:00.930 --> 43:03.840
How did they bring the guns so high?

43:03.840 --> 43:05.750
Everything is becoming more and more dangerous.

43:06.350 --> 43:08.110
Thank you so much.

43:06.910 --> 43:08.000
And you, too.

43:08.880 --> 43:12.800
Well, the shelter became famous.

43:12.800 --> 43:13.510
Yes.

43:14.840 --> 43:18.220
It has been hard work, my legs can't hold me anymore.

43:19.330 --> 43:23.660
Keiko helped us out, bringing tatami boards from home.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.280
Shūsaku, why is she here?

43:29.950 --> 43:31.820
Simply, it happened.

43:33.130 --> 43:35.660
But now we need to clean up.

43:38.150 --> 43:43.000
Shūsaku, should I take this earth into the fields?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.550
Yes, of course, just be careful.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.770
Ah, you're here, too.

43:49.950 --> 43:52.130
Yeah, I'm watching the ships.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.440
Today a lot of them have gathered.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.620
The Yamato is the biggest.
The second one is the Musashi.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
There are many cruisers, but there are no aircraft carriers.

44:07.840 --> 44:11.130
This is the Tone, she has no towers behind her.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.130
Is she an aircraft carrier?

44:13.460 --> 44:17.730
Wow, that's great. How much you know.

44:17.910 --> 44:20.950
Yeah. I learned this from my brother.

44:21.570 --> 44:24.680
I see. I also know something.

44:25.730 --> 44:26.460
These are destroyers.

44:26.460 --> 44:26.950
Yeah.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.040
And there's something small floating around.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.710
It's a boat.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.370
Do you want me to tell you something?

44:36.220 --> 44:38.020
Do you see that huge cloud?

44:38.420 --> 44:38.970
Yeah.

44:38.970 --> 44:40.970
These are called "anvils".

44:41.150 --> 44:41.800
Yes.

44:42.370 --> 44:43.800
Oh, and it will rain very hard.

44:44.240 --> 44:44.820
Eh?

44:48.240 --> 44:49.260
Shūsaku!

44:48.930 --> 44:51.930
Let's hide in here for now.

45:01.220 --> 45:02.170
Thanks.

45:09.710 --> 45:11.280
I can do it myself.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.460
Are you very fond of ships?

45:14.570 --> 45:15.020
What?

45:15.370 --> 45:17.080
I spoke with Harumi.

45:17.310 --> 45:21.000
Ah... It was not I who taught Harumi.

45:21.620 --> 45:22.660
It was He-bo.

45:22.750 --> 45:23.370
Hee?

45:23.880 --> 45:27.150
Yes. He also likes ships.

45:27.710 --> 45:29.420
One day you will meet him.

45:30.220 --> 45:33.370
This Hisao, is this him?

45:34.150 --> 45:34.950
Yes.

45:45.950 --> 45:49.240
Now we kiss beside his name.

45:54.130 --> 45:56.880
Well, it was just a little sprinkle.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.080
You can go home already.

45:59.620 --> 46:00.660
Listen...

46:00.860 --> 46:05.200
This is fine when the family has a friendly relationship.

46:05.620 --> 46:09.820
Yes, husband and wife that loves each other. How lovely.

46:09.820 --> 46:11.330
Keiko?

46:14.240 --> 46:18.860
They really were close to each other, both so tall.

46:19.660 --> 46:24.910
Could it be that something happened to her husband?

46:25.130 --> 46:29.440
He was tall and thin, he was not even accepted into the army.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.400
He probably was too thin.

46:32.860 --> 46:39.170
When my father found a new job, my sister went to buy him a present.

46:39.570 --> 46:42.020
She met a young merchant.

46:39.570 --> 46:42.020
Kuromura Watch Shop

46:43.150 --> 46:47.730
They got married and ran a watch shop together.

46:48.730 --> 46:52.020
But you know what kind of character Keiko is.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.910
She quarreled with all of his family.

46:55.400 --> 47:01.150
Then her husband died and she had to manage the shop alone.

47:01.480 --> 47:06.310
Then there was some demolition and now, there is nothing left.

47:08.370 --> 47:11.280
Hisao is still the heir of the Kuromura family.

47:11.910 --> 47:14.400
He is now in Simonosaki.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.550
Naturally, it's hard for her.

47:18.260 --> 47:22.220
An happy family, where everyone smiles.

47:23.110 --> 47:24.660
Probably.

47:33.330 --> 47:35.150
I'll quickly go check the beds.

47:48.950 --> 47:53.480
Such simple things, but I didn't understand them for several months.

47:54.020 --> 47:56.040
How stupid I am.

48:00.860 --> 48:02.200
This is the Yamato.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.910
Like this.

48:11.020 --> 48:13.280
Well, I'm just...

48:11.760 --> 48:14.680
Military police Kempeitai.

48:15.150 --> 48:18.860
It's just a drawing for my niece.

48:18.860 --> 48:20.600
Do you know this woman?

48:20.600 --> 48:22.040
Ke... Kempei?

48:23.330 --> 48:27.710
To make sketches of the coastline is an act of espionage!

48:27.710 --> 48:33.460
Her face looks so innocent, but who knows what insidious plans ripen in her heart.

48:34.800 --> 48:40.220
This woman's husband serves as a clerk in the naval court.

48:40.460 --> 48:44.200
Maybe she's looking for a way to steal military secrets?

48:45.060 --> 48:47.170
Maybe she tried to send signals to someone?

48:47.680 --> 48:50.570
Maybe you found tables with codes in her things?

48:50.660 --> 48:53.970
Maybe you're hiding something? Confess!

48:55.970 --> 48:58.460
Consider that you got off lightly.

48:58.770 --> 49:03.310
Keep an eye on her, now no one can be trusted.

49:15.350 --> 49:16.460
I'm home.

49:17.550 --> 49:20.710
Why are all the clothes scattered around?

49:20.910 --> 49:24.910
Oh, Shūsaku, Suzu was almost arrested.

49:27.820 --> 49:30.220
Suzu, come here.

49:38.130 --> 49:41.060
Although in such a small book, you won't be able to draw much.

49:43.420 --> 49:49.280
You really like drawing so much, will you draw me sometime?

49:50.260 --> 49:54.400
It's probably better not to draw you.

49:56.730 --> 49:59.260
We have a spy in Suzu.

49:59.930 --> 50:02.910
Shūsaku, how can you hold back?

50:03.110 --> 50:06.660
We so apologized to them.

50:06.660 --> 50:08.680
And they bursted out laughing.

50:08.680 --> 50:11.350
When you try not to laugh, your face gets even weirder.

50:14.660 --> 50:19.480
It was like she didn't notice anything around her.

50:19.710 --> 50:23.950
For some people, a naive person seems so cunning.

50:24.310 --> 50:28.600
The only thing Suzu remembers about my job is that it ends at six in the evening.

50:28.820 --> 50:32.530
I'm also a military secret, the Kempeitai are so dumb.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.800
I don't understand anything, but it's still funny.

50:39.350 --> 50:42.930
An happy family, where everyone smiles.

50:43.480 --> 50:44.770
Indeed...

50:44.770 --> 50:45.820
I'm home.

50:46.750 --> 50:49.020
Dad, it was like that right now!

50:50.510 --> 50:52.800
For some reason, I'm not the only one who's funny.

50:50.930 --> 50:54.510
And they asked where her code tables were.

50:54.840 --> 50:57.130
I could hardly restrain myself.

50:59.070 --> 51:04.290
August

50:59.970 --> 51:03.820
The war is on, the cicadas are singing, and the butterflies are flying.

51:04.570 --> 51:06.240
It's so hot.

51:05.250 --> 51:09.980
Attention
Starting in August
The delivery of sugar will stop,
Hurry up to get some

51:08.350 --> 51:10.060
What, there won't be any sugar?

51:11.340 --> 51:17.030
When the air raids began in June, the war seemed to be very close.

51:17.730 --> 51:19.880
Where is she going now?

51:23.420 --> 51:24.710
Ow.

51:24.860 --> 51:26.910
Harumi, I'm sorry.

51:26.910 --> 51:30.200
I'm ok. There are a lot of ants.

51:32.020 --> 51:34.730
I wonder where they all creep to?

51:54.880 --> 51:56.840
SUGAR

51:55.970 --> 51:58.910
Not the sugar, it's too expensive!

52:06.130 --> 52:08.910
We must put it where the ants won't reach it.

52:09.260 --> 52:12.480
Where do we find such a place?

52:16.860 --> 52:18.600
What? What's wrong with you?

52:19.220 --> 52:24.260
We thought that if put it in water,
the ants wouldn't get to it.

52:33.110 --> 52:36.550
Take the money. Go and buy more.

52:40.750 --> 52:42.640
I've never been here before.

52:45.770 --> 52:47.040
Try it.

52:52.420 --> 52:56.770
If there are no products anywhere,
why is there so many people?

53:01.640 --> 53:05.220
Taiwanese rice from old stocks.

53:02.050 --> 53:06.430
Next entry planned
At the end of the month

53:06.570 --> 53:09.350
And then our own local production is no worse.

53:10.330 --> 53:14.150
Wait, aren't watermelons forbidden to grow?

53:16.400 --> 53:18.170
What's this?

53:22.220 --> 53:25.020
It's like it was the summer before the war.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.620
Twenty yen for a kin.

53:26.370 --> 53:28.620
*1 kin = 600 grams

53:29.370 --> 53:31.800
Fifty times more than at the distribution?

53:31.910 --> 53:34.750
Tomorrow, it will become even more expensive.

53:35.020 --> 53:40.240
Mom's money plus this month's living allowance are only 25 yen.

53:40.210 --> 53:43.700
Not buy

53:40.210 --> 53:43.700
buy

53:40.440 --> 53:43.130
Kaki no dance.

53:46.400 --> 53:53.880
If sugar is now about 150 yen, then you can't buy caramel for 100 yen.

53:54.170 --> 53:58.770
Soon it will be a thousand yen just for three pairs of socks.

54:00.080 --> 54:03.600
What will happen to the country, how will it survive?

54:09.220 --> 54:12.620
Wait, where did I get to?

54:13.350 --> 54:16.080
Naganoki? It's behind the military cemetery.

54:16.510 --> 54:18.370
Although, there also Nagasako.

54:18.420 --> 54:19.820
In that direction.

54:20.020 --> 54:21.130
No, over there.

54:36.310 --> 54:37.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:42.460 --> 54:43.080
It's nothing.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.110
A watermelon?

54:45.550 --> 54:46.240
Yes.

54:46.600 --> 54:47.620
Caramel?

54:48.150 --> 54:48.930
Yes.

54:49.060 --> 54:50.080
You're lost?

54:50.370 --> 54:51.240
Yes.

54:51.930 --> 54:55.400
And to say you are an adult... Where are you from?

54:55.860 --> 54:56.930
Naganoki.

54:57.860 --> 55:01.530
Sister, no one's telling me the way.

55:01.970 --> 55:06.640
And then everyone is smiling instead, maybe I'm in a fairy tale?

55:07.110 --> 55:12.530
Naganoki, it's right past the post office, and then...

55:13.400 --> 55:14.480
Wait here.

55:16.170 --> 55:18.800
Sister, can I leave?

55:23.800 --> 55:26.280
From this point, you go straight over there.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.930
And then behind the post office, you go right two time and then straight ahead.

55:30.620 --> 55:32.310
Thank you so much!

55:33.440 --> 55:36.750
No one here knows the city well.

55:37.110 --> 55:41.200
Almost everyone are from different places and never leave the district.

55:41.770 --> 55:45.860
You don't look like you're from Hiroshima... maybe from the coast?

55:46.280 --> 55:48.550
Yeah from over there. How do you know?

55:48.800 --> 55:49.800
Your accent.

55:51.150 --> 55:52.000
Are you from Eba?

55:52.220 --> 55:54.130
No, from Kusatsu.

55:54.130 --> 55:55.310
Kusatsu!

55:56.260 --> 55:59.260
I went there every year to see my grandmother and eat watermelon.

55:59.800 --> 56:04.660
Our family was poor, I only got watermelon's skins.

56:05.200 --> 56:10.620
Although, one time, some good people gave me a taste of the core.

56:11.350 --> 56:13.130
That was a long time ago.

56:14.110 --> 56:16.440
Maybe you could draw something for me?

56:16.860 --> 56:20.280
For something to remember... here...

56:21.220 --> 56:22.600
As easy as pie.

56:23.040 --> 56:24.950
I can draw anything, just say it.

56:25.420 --> 56:27.420
Mint candies! Ferns cookies!

56:27.680 --> 56:29.150
Mint...

56:29.330 --> 56:33.550
Ice cream in a waffle cone.

56:33.820 --> 56:34.770
A waffle cone?

56:35.020 --> 56:38.310
You don't know?
You never went to a café?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.370
Enough time off already!

56:41.510 --> 56:43.530
I'm sorry, I have to go.

56:44.820 --> 56:46.550
I'll draw you something the next time.

56:48.510 --> 56:52.600
No. You shouldn't come here again.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.200
You'll get lost again.

57:19.260 --> 57:24.200
You were gone a long time.
I thought you got lost in the city.

57:25.370 --> 57:31.860
Sister, do you know what's an ice cream in a waffle cone?

57:32.020 --> 57:33.680
You don't know?

57:34.280 --> 57:35.790
Oh you.

57:35.790 --> 57:40.750
It's sweet and cold, with a crispy shell, the best dessert.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.710
Ah, there was a time...

57:43.530 --> 57:44.370
There...

57:47.570 --> 57:53.040
Just remembering something that delicious is making simple water seems sweeter.

57:56.360 --> 58:02.660
September

58:00.130 --> 58:01.640
The heat isn't subsiding.

58:03.240 --> 58:06.800
Mrs. Hojo, you have a phone call.

58:07.950 --> 58:10.460
What? For me?

58:14.040 --> 58:15.460
Ah, here it is.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.240
It's so hot.

58:18.240 --> 58:21.800
So you're going to go like that?
Are you not ashamed?

58:32.110 --> 58:34.020
Let's take a walk, it's not that far.

58:34.510 --> 58:37.800
Well, how are things with the police?

58:37.880 --> 58:39.330
Without incident.

58:39.330 --> 58:42.060
Good. Well then, you can...

58:58.400 --> 59:01.710
Shūsaku, I brought your notebook.

59:02.110 --> 59:02.800
Eh?

59:06.800 --> 59:08.420
Ah, Suzu!

59:09.260 --> 59:11.200
You're so pale, are you well?

59:12.130 --> 59:13.800
What? I look strange?

59:14.860 --> 59:16.860
No, you look all right.

59:17.510 --> 59:18.860
Let's go.

59:19.620 --> 59:21.480
Eh? What about work?

59:21.970 --> 59:25.150
I deliberately left the notebook at home so I could be free.

59:26.330 --> 59:29.170
You said you wanted to go shopping.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.350
What are you doing?

59:34.770 --> 59:35.860
You're sure you're ok?

59:36.240 --> 59:38.310
It's my turn to burst out laughing.

59:44.200 --> 59:46.220
I thought I'd take you to the movies.

59:48.600 --> 59:51.510
But then a big ship came to port.

59:53.660 --> 59:58.480
We'll have to give up, but we'll go some other time.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.530
Suzu?

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:07.600
Many of my former classmates are now in the Navy.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.840
What if I see one of them?

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.460
You just greet them normally.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:21.130
If I meet someone I know from the past, he could wake me up from my dream.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.420
Your dream?

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.480
I have a different name and address, and not an easy and simple life.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.840
But you've always been kind to me.

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:31.640
And a good friend too.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.460
I don't want to wake up right now.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.260
If this is the real me, then so much the better.

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:40.510
I see.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.510
Past events, unselected paths.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.710
They are all like broken dreams.

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:53.840
Suzu, for me, the best reality is the one in which I chose you.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.660
You're so skinny, I'm worried.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.480
You know, I felt hungry in the last few days.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.110
Here, double scoop.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.010
HOSPITAL

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.530
You ate a lot in the morning, now that's enough.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.420
Great, back to the usual portion.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.460
December

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.110
I'll go ask first.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:40.800
Okay.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.820
Who's there? Wow, a real sailor!

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:51.240
I went out for water, and we accidentally met.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.730
I'm Mizuhara Tetsu, a sailor from the ship Aoba.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.020
The Aoba is a heavy cruiser.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.110
Behave, Harumi.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.460
It's winter right now and he's tan.

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:10.040
So, would you like to wash up with us?

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:13.000
We were given some free time for washing up.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:18.480
I didn't know where to go, but I remembered Suzu and decided to ask around for her.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.680
Thank you for taking care of her.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.510
Suzu used to draw skillfully and harvest nori.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.800
There's probably no benefit from her.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.370
So just ask, and I'll take her back.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.080
Don't be insolent! "Suzu-Suzu"...
Did I allow you to call me that?

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.280
And how should I call you?

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.280
You're not Urano anymore.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:48.220
Eh?

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.400
Suzu, don't be rude to our guest.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:02.750
What's so funny?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.260
It's interesting.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.370
You're so ordinary.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:08.840
It's delicious! Delicious!

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.260
Eat for health.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.350
This is heaven.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.910
Suzu, will you rub my back?

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:16.060
Idiot!

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:18.820
Suzu, where's the light bulb?

01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:21.710
I think it's in the table drawer.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.550
I see.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.680
When I grow up, I'll also become a sailor.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.000
That's our thing.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:29.800
Drink.

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:31.280
Thanks for the treat.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:32.860
Best regards.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.510
Good night.

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:36.620
Good night.

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:40.570
It's a good thing.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.420
Well, I'm going too.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.600
How's the Aoba now?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.220
We were damaged in Manila,
we managed to crawl back for repairs.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.000
She's a good ship. She's still afloat after everything that happened.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.820
Shūsaku, when everyone die around you, It's haunting to still be alive.

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:08.660
Mizuhara, my father isn't here tonight and I'm in charge.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.040
I'm sorry, but I'm not letting you stay in the house.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.770
He's going to sleep in the barn's attic.

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:25.800
And you're harsh with him.
I haven't seen you like this before.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.860
Here, the bed-stove. Bring it to him.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:34.910
Talk to him tonight, there may not be another time.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:52.310
I'm sorry about the barn.

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.770
After the hanging beds, this is paradise.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:05:00.310
Here, it will warm you up while we talk.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.240
Okay.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.530
Here, this is for you.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.570
Really?

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:12.820
Do you want to write with it?

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:13.260
Yes.

01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:16.060
Just like that.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.930
It's working!

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.820
It's working.

01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:31.400
A bird that looked like a heron flew over us in the middle of the ocean.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.020
Herons can fly over the ocean.

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:35.240
Exactly.

01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:39.510
In Eba, they live near the river all year round.

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.910
Yes, there's really a lot in Eba.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.130
It seems I forgot how to draw them.

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.000
Even you don't always get out?

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.840
It's been a long time since you painted?

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:55.930
Yeah.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.060
Remember those rabbits on the waves?

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.550
I remember.

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:06.660
Oh, and there were problems with them.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.170
Eh? Why is that?

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260
You don't remember?

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:18.370
The teacher sent that drawing to the city competition, and it managed to take a prize.

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:24.060
But I didn't draw it, imagine how awkward I was.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:28.600
It was you that was supposed to win.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.820
Suzu, you're so warm, so soft, you smell like...

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.150
Mizuhara.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.860
It think I waited a long time for this day to come.

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:59.570
You came back like this... wanting to be so close to me!

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:06.620
How can I... Ah! Now I'm angry with you!

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:10.440
I'm sorry, really sorry.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:15.110
Do you love your husband?

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.550
Yes.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.200
You're still so ordinary.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.170
Sorry.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:27.110
You get angry when you're supposed to be.
Sorry about that.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.080
So, you don't want me to pick you up?

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.460
You were forced to leave for him, it doesn't matter?

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:34.550
No.

01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:36.550
Well, that's good.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:40.860
He's four years older?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600
Shūsaku?

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:45.080
He's the age of my drowned brother.

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:51.350
We were poor, so my brother had to go to the nautical school.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:54.970
He died, and I took his place.

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:58.000
That's the way it is.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.220
But somewhere, I turned off the road laid ahead for an ordinary person.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.420
But...

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:08.020
I'm relieved that you live a normal life.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:11.440
If I die, don't pray for me.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.330
Just remember me and smile.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:22.260
I just wish you'd been at the end of road of the most ordinary man in the world.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.819
Suzu!

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:24.529
What?

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:25.880
You have become a beauty.

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.970
Don't be foolish!

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:37.359
In fact, since childhood, it was hard for me to find the right words for you.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:38.670
Tetsu
Thank you for the feather.
Thank you for growing up as a worthy person.
Come back alive and healthy.
Suzu.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.200
The remains of the deceased warrior Miyamoto Teru

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.200
The remains of the deceased warrior Kawauti Tahai

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.200
The remains of the lost warrior Urano Yoichi

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.510
February

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.640
Welcome back, brother.

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:55.149
There was a pebble instead of dust in the box.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.729
It was so small and smooth.

01:08:57.729 --> 01:08:59.970
Is that a piece of his skull?

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.529
Maybe it's not him?

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.640
Then what happened to him?

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:08.130
And why was it necessary to convoke everyone in such a cold weather?

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:10.970
Our Yoichi could not have died so easily.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:14.600
People are so fragile.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:19.710
I can't remember his face, not even his voice.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:22.840
Shūsaku.

01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:27.750
Thank you for that time.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.479
When you let me talk to Mizuhara.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:34.529
My pleasure.

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:38.859
However, Shūsaku, you trust our couple to this degree?

01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:43.970
I made you leave for me.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.660
And didn't even notice that you were angry.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:52.910
And you're not noticing now?

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.450
Ooooh. Are you angry now?

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.660
You just don't care!

01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:00.880
Ooooh.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.950
Then why are you wearing a leaky socks today?

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:10.130
You gave them to me, so I put them on.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.350
They were different!

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:15.350
Listen, can you fight at home?

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.570
Are you confusing the road again? This way.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.620
I know.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.350
To the right. In the direction of Mount Higamine.

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:25.640
Yes, I know!

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:35.330
A lot of snow fell this winter and spring was delayed.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:48.530
♪ Just look, snowflakes fly straight from the sky.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.380
March 19

01:10:48.820 --> 01:11:00.400
♪ Like thousands of tiny white roses, they fall down.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:06.370
Come on, you're so obedient, the teacher won't scold you.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.200
Really? Is it scary at school?

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:10.680
Not at all.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.840
You don't have any friends here.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.750
For example, when I moved here, I was all alone.

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.350
And now I made friends with everyone.

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:21.530
And with my mom too?

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.880
Put your hood on.

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:17.440
Harumi!

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:43.440
It's like paint on a large canvas.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.170
What am I thinking about?

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:54.570
What are you standing there for?
Lie down and press against the wall.

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:56.680
Welcome back.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.130
Yeah, it's a good time to be welcome.

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:05.730
Be careful, shards can get here.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.000
Ow!

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.420
Just listen.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:27.020
Eh?

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:30.840
This sound of our engines is 2000 horsepower.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:37.350
We worked day and night in the factory to improve them.

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:43.970
We started with the usual type-95, with a capacity of only 500 horsepower.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:51.440
New technologies and hard work.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.560
For the sake of eternal peace and prosperity.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:03.290
We spare no effort...

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:05.400
What's the horse power of our enemies?

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:10.150
Say, the horse power of our enemies?

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:11.710
Dad!

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.280
The raid is over!

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:26.660
He worked night shift relentlessly.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:31.000
And during the raid, he just laid down on the ground and fell asleep.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.310
I was so scared!

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.170
After the raid, we collected a lot of dead fish.

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:38.480
Small!

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:42.040
And you draw a big one, and it will become bigger.

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:50.840
04:50
March 29

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.750
Air alarm! Air alarm!

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.080
Put your hood on, put out the lights.

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.860
Remove the paper doors.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:57.620
Take the essentials and go to the shelter.

01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:03.040
The raid is over!

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.260
It's not cooked at all.

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.800

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440
What a pain.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:15.060
Her husband and elder brother were killed in the war, now they are taking their son to the army.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.060
Congratulations.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:25.580
1 April
22h10

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.350
Wear your protective hood.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.570
Extinguish the lights.

01:15:24.570 --> 01:15:26.080
Remove the paper doors.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.370
Set the Fire-fighting...

01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:31.040
You can't see a thing.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:31.680
Ay.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.150
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.110
Whose cat is this?

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:44.310
How many alerts is it?

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.200
It's the first time I see this.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.250
April 6

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.970
10:43. Heavy bombers are coming from Tokuyama.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:19.170
May 5

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.640
Tokuyama is launching.

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:25.240
Thirty targets seen in the southeast of Tokushima prefecture are moving towards Kure.

01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:30.730
The raid is over!

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.440
More than 125 B-29 bombers participated in the raid.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:41.660
Hiro's naval arsenal suffered serious damage.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.110
I'm home.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.750
But the number of casualties is minimal.

01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:44.640
Are you okay, Shūsaku?

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:45.730
And father?

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.240
He didn't come back.

01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:49.330
I see.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.510
Suzu, put out the fire.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.220
Suzu, you're so small.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.240
What?

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:12.680
You're still small.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.060
So what?

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:16.240
Nothing.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.800
I'm just telling you the truth.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.860
Dad's going to be fine.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:35.910
There's a uniform.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:36.710
Eh?

01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:39.020
In that package.

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:43.840
Starting the 15th, we're becoming part of the army.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.110
I'm a soldier now, and I am going to exercise with the fleet.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.880
I won't be here for three months.

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:54.080
But then you'll come back?

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:55.110
Probably.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.330
Are you going to be okay, Suzu?

01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:01.110
You're so small and skinny.

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:05.660
If there are no men left to hold the fort, will you be able to protect it?

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.510
No.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.600
No way!

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm sorry, that's not true.

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:20.770
I love you.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.880
But in three months, I'm going to forget your face.

01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:27.730
Suzu.

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:30.040
I'll be waiting for you in this house.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:34.620
If it's not there, I might not find you.

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:39.980
May 6
Sunday.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.780
May 8
Tuesday.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:48.320
May 10.
Thursday.
Air alarm.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:48.320
May 11.
Friday.
Two alarms
in the morning.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.320
May 12.
Saturday.
There was no alarm.

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:48.320
May 13.
Sunday.
Only a siren
three times.

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:54.580
May 14

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.310
And now you won't forget?

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.060
It was just a saying.

01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:01.640
No, not in your case.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.660
Let me see how you drew me.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:05.710
No way.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.950
This is a military secret.

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:17.600
May 15

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.280
Well, I'm leaving.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:26.770
Have a safe trip.

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.840
Shūsaku, you and I are on our way.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.330
Yes.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.170
You've become a real sailor.

01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:40.130
The house just became completely empty.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:46.590
June 21

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:46.400
For Ms. Hojo!

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.590
Hiroshima Prefecture, Kure, Upper Naganoki, 808

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.660
He was supposed to get to the factory hospital.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:58.110
Wow...

01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:00.400
That's why they couldn't find him.

01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:05.440
Dad was wounded in the stomach and on the head, but he's almost recovered.

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.910
I'll take his watch for repairs.

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:17.060
This is a rare occasion to see the Kuromura in Simonoseki for a short while. I'll go tomorrow.

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:20.040
To the place where brother lives?

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:21.350
I'm going.

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.620
Will you take me?

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:26.060
Is this a school?

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:29.860
It's a school. But now there's only gymnastics in there.

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:44.350
It's going to take a long time.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:49.770
While I'm buying a ticket, can you and Harumi go see Papa at the hospital?

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.350
All right, come with me, Harumi.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.350
We'll go see the fleet base?

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:56.370
Yes.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.950
Why are you frowning?

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.930
They make the best bamboo spears in the world over there.

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:07.110
Are you stupid? My husband's parents are terrible people.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.480
Just seeing you like this is unusual...

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.930
And what should I do with a bamboo spear?

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.220
Is Simonosaki far?

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:15.950
Yes.

01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:18.150
Next to Hiroshima?

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.480
Much farther.

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.310
That way?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.910
Here's the hospital, be quiet.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:29.950
They're listening to enemy songs?

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:32.110
I made you worry.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:36.570
I was unconscious all the time until June.

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:38.240
What's important is that you're alive.

01:21:38.710 --> 01:21:41.970
And now we will take the train and go see my brother.

01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:44.910
Are you? Well, the sooner, the better.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.750
Uncle, what ship are you from?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.150
From mine trawler number 16.

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:55.770
I've learned a lot of news over here.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.980
Hiro's arsenal has been destroyed.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.020
The whole fleet wants to be transferred to the army command.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.860
Suzu, they sunk the Yamato.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:06.730
The Yamato?

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.970
Yes.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:11.970
She moved in front of the fleet, diverting enemies onto herself.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.910
The inner Sea of Japan now belongs to the enemy.

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:20.600
So the rabbits are on the waves now...

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.460
Really? Really?

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:21.660
What?

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:22.680
Nothing.

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:25.060
I would advise the same.

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.860
Harumi should be sent to her father's family.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.370
It'll be much safer there.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.150
What about sister...

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:36.570
Listen, Suzu.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:37.130
Yes?

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.620
Let's see from over there?

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:42.110
I'll tell my brother what ships we have here.

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.310
I can't see anything.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.530
Let's keep going. Let's keep going.

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:48.080
I can't see.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.880
There's trouble, what to do?

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:56.400
We don't have time to get back home.
There should be a public shelter somewhere.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:22:59.820
Is there really something flying?

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:02.770
They usually just try to scare us and fly away.

01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:11.330
09:23. North-east of Tokuyama, enemy aircrafts going towards Kure.

01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:15.440
Looks like the really are flying.

01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:17.620
Excuse me, can we come with you?

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:18.820
Come in.

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.910
Red alert! Faster!

01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:27.600
Suzu, I'm afraid.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.800
Don't worry, look.

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:33.880
Mama?

01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:36.020
Yes, and who is this?

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:37.880
Harumi?

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.550
Here you are with your mother.

01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.800
You must be from afar.

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.880
We're here to visit the hospital. From Naganoki.

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.170
You're out of luck.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.820
Here they are! Close your ears, open your mouth, bend your head!

01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:54.730
It's hot.

01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:56.330
Bend down.

01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:33.240
Excuse me, can we have some water?

01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.770
Yes.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.910
Thank you very much.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.750
We're not too late for the train?

01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:48.260
The train couldn't leave, it waiting for us.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:59.020
I can't see anything!

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.710
Are you okay over there?

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.970
Yes!

01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:11.310
It's dangerous to stand there. There
could be unexploded bombs. Go away.

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.280
What? Thank you for your work!

01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:20.130
Say, Suzu, are you going to draw my brother?

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.420
Craters from unexploded bombs are not large.

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:26.660
According to the latest civil defense reports,

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:29.370
Part of the bombs dropped by the enemy...

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.730
Let's go, Harumi!

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.770
Okay, here we go again. Not like that.

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.240
No one's will ever get married to you like that.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:21.770
I think I've been told this a lot, but I'm already married.

01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:24.770
Watermelon.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.240
Ferns biscuits.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.730
Mint candies.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:35.460
If the road had a ditch, we could have hidden in it.

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:39.330
In my left hand, things.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.140
In my right hand, Harumi.

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:46.150
If it were the other way around.

01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:51.280
I could have thrown off my sandals and ran.

01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:56.480
Further down the slope, to the other side...

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.220
This is the Tone, and that one's the Hyuga.

01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:04.240
Mom, this is the Yamato.

01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:14.640
She... she looks so much like Shuusaku.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.750
I should have followed... I really should have followed you...

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.860
I'm sorry. Forgive me, Harumi.

01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.860
I'm sorry, sister.

01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:28.530
Murderer!

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.310
Murderer!

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:32.770
Don't, Keiko.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.730
Give me back Harumi!!

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.420
The tofu distribution will begin soon.

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:41.680
She's grieving, don't let it go in your head.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.040
It is good that at least you are alive.

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:48.930
Really?

01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:54.510
There's a place for everyone in this world.

01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:55.310
Rin.

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.840
Yes?

01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.620
And then? Where was my cherished place?

01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:05.400
In that fence there could have been a broken board.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.840
And the wind from the explosion would have carried us.

01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:13.170
Far, far from there.

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:18.350
June 28

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.820
Well, here we are again.

01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:20.460
I can't hear the planes. Keep sleeping.

01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:24.620
Nothing will happen to the house?

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:28.130
Of course, don't worry.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:29.600
I'm glad.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.280
Liar.

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.310
That woman...

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:40.550
If our house were broken, I could go away from the city.

01:28:41.290 --> 01:28:45.290
July 1

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:44.570
Don't force yourself.

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:49.400
You know, we don't have the time to relax.

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:50.510
See you later.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.220
Looks like the Sun came out.

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:59.330
Let me tie you up.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.750
The central region's defense reports.

01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:08.520
23:50. Two targets are observed in the bay of Hiroshima.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.120
There are two targets over the Suo Strait. There is also two more targets above the Bungo Channel.

01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:11.680
Are you awake, Suzu?

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.780
And also in the northeast are seen...

01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:21.110
23:58. A lot of enemy planes are circling over Hiroshima and Kure.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.510
Like this.

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:28.150
23:58. A lot of enemy planes are circling over Hiroshima and Kure.

01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:32.510
They say that there are many planes. But you can't even see their shadows.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.240
Flare bombs?

01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.930
Suzu, come with us more quickly.

01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:05.550
Let's get outta here!

01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:18.020
Suzu? Why aren't you coming?

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.330
Hurry up!

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.910
Suzu! Suzu!

01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:41.600
Suzu, why are you staying?

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:44.260
Water! More water!

01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:47.020
Well, we got it.

01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:48.080
Defense of the central region.

01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:55.460
00:30. The enemy air group flew over the Bungo Channel.

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.510
Careful.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:03.080
In addition, one more air group is approaching the Bungo Channel and three more were seen in the southern waters.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.510
So that's it.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.880
One-two.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.260
End of message.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.350
This is JOFK. The transmitting station of Hiroshima.

01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:10.780
Residents of Kure, hang on!

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.530
Residents of Kure, hang on!

01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:23.950
To the affected inhabitants of Kure, Hiroshima sends rice.

01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:28.210
Distribution will be in Ito Park!

01:31:28.210 --> 01:31:30.420
And where will I get my I.D.?

01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:32.150
The government don't know yet.

01:31:32.150 --> 01:31:34.200
My house burned down.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.420
They didn't get into the bomb shelter and remained alive.

01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:37.600
Can I get that bandage?

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.950
Take it.

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:47.640
Here, eat it while it's hot. I kept them in the subfield and they were all baked.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.110
Thank you.

01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:51.820
And for my sister...

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:57.170
Oh, the heat, it's so hot.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.860
Is there anyone from Sinonome?

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:05.730
There was no fire break in Asahimachi. Almost everything burned out.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:06.710
I see.

01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:09.660
Suzu!

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:13.530
Hey. Are you hurt?

01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:14.910
What about your training?

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:15.730
They stopped it.

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:19.060
It's a good thing you're alive.

01:32:20.150 --> 01:32:22.440
And now I suddenly want to sleep.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.110
Suzu!

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:29.510
"We'll find a cool place," came to me from somewhere.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:24.800
Suzu! What are you doing?

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.660
It's a good thing...

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.480
It's a good thing that she had time to put it out.

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:39.330
It's a good thing it wasn't a bomb.

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:41.600
It's a good thing it didn't catch fire.

01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:43.930
It's a good thing that it's healing so quickly.

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:48.440
Good, good, good...

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:53.020
I no longer know what is good.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.150
In June, I held Harumi with my right hand.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:02.800
In May, I painted Shūsaku's face with my right hand.

01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:07.950
In April, I took the lipstick with my right hand.

01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:12.200
In February, I held the remains of my brother with my right hand.

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:17.460
Last November, I accidentally ruined my sister's kimono with my right hand.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.440
Last August I drew a watermelon for Rin with my right hand.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:25.710
Last July, the kempeitai took away the drawing made with my right hand.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.460
Last May, I cooked Kusunoki's rice recipe with my right hand.

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:29.710
Last April I tore the dandelions with my right hand.

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:34.040
Last March I drew my hometown with my right hand.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.510
Two years ago I collected nori with my right hand.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.260
Seven years ago in February, I drew rabbits with my right hand.

01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.260
Your sister's here.

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.680
What happened to you, Suzu?

01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:50.750
Sumi?

01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:53.310
You came to see me?

01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:58.130
A officer I know let me ride on the truck to help.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.460
What's that?

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:01.170
So.

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.880
Here. It's old, but it's pure cotton.

01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.750
Without artificial fibers?

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.350
Absolutely.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.640
Sorry.

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:31.400
And here's some medlar from Ebayama.

01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:33.350
Can you do that?

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:37.370
I need to do some stretching. I'll walk you halfway.

01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:40.640
I'm expected not far from the fire station.

01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:43.530
Why not at the observation tower on the river?

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.150
Ah, it's probably burnt.

01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:47.800
It's still in place.

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:50.950
One officer from Kure showed it to me.

01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:57.280
He's so young and kind, he used to give me coupons for lunch and movie tickets.

01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:02.640
And he remembered that I have a married big sister here.

01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:03.910
Are you in love?

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.640
Oh, what are you talking about, Suzu?

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:08.750
It hurts.

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:14.500
Go back to your place and
continue to work. Let's go
to work together. Put all your
hatred in hard work.
To protect your hometown
we need heroic perseverance.
Don't give up!
2 July, Shōwa 20. Kure's City Hall

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:14.500
Attention
1. Food stocks have been prepared.
2. Emergency centers are fully equipped
3. Distribution of funds for the first
need to start immediately
Kure's City Hall

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.080
This is awful.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.020
Kure gets bombed endlessly, how do people endure?

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:35.510
It's so awful when there's no home to return to.

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:39.060
Listen, Suzu.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.280
Return with us to Hiroshima.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:43.440
Eh?

01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:45.840
It's almost not bombed.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.260
Brother is no more, no one's going to hurt you.

01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:54.550
It's tempting.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.800
At the same time I could see if your young officer is really cute.

01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:02.130
It's not fair.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.310
Yes, I'm joking.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.660
Bye then.

01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:05.570
I'm skewed.

01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:08.260
Think about it.

01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:13.710
Next month, on the 6th, there will be a festival, come back home.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.060
Thank you, Sumi.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.000
I was glad that my brother was dead.

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.730
I'm skewed, like drawings with my left hand.

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.390
28 July
7 am

01:37:13.710 --> 01:37:17.550
Today they are buzzing all day.
We need to take something with us.

01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:18.350
Ouch!

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.750
Suzu, come down here.

01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:29.880
You can't come in here.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.930
You can't come here now!

01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:47.260
Fly away! Fly away from here!

01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:50.420
Fly away up the mountain! To Hiroshima!

01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:24.200
Are you tired of living?

01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:26.240
Forgive me.

01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.550
A heron. A heron flew by.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.820
It flew away from the sea.

01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:38.480
Shūsaku, I want... to return to Hiroshima.

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.750
And never come back?

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.840
Are you having a hard time without a hand?

01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:50.420
Are you afraid of the attacks?

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:52.710
Is it because of Harumi?

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:53.680
That's right.

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:55.060
That's right.

01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:56.730
So it is.

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.080
I can't hear you!

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.020
Not at all.

01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:02.280
Then why?

01:39:03.930 --> 01:39:07.060
Suzu, I was happy.

01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.680
Going back to the house where you are waiting.

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.860
Walking with you through the streets and talking about something.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.060
Aren't you?

01:39:18.330 --> 01:39:20.260
Were you just pretending?

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:24.620
I'm not listening.

01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:28.460
I'm not listening, I'm not hearing anything!

01:39:28.570 --> 01:39:31.950
I Want! Home! Back to Hiroshima!

01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:35.600
Is that it? Well, go!

01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:53.090
9 days later

01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:51.710
The enemies of the central region are not seen.

01:39:52.150 --> 01:39:55.000
The enemies of the central region are not seen.

01:39:55.660 --> 01:40:00.880
In Hiroshima prefecture at 07:31 the air alarm is canceled.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.970
So the alarm has been canceled.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.860
Well, then we're going.

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.620
Have a safe trip.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.710
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:14.620
More over there.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.950
Oh, it's morning, it's already hot.

01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:24.800
It will be lonely in here when Suzu leaves us.

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.710
Say, when do you want to go?

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:47.550
Eh?

01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:48.910
The hospital.

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.680
Ah... by 10 o'clock.

01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:57.750
You're not going to do that.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.420
I'm sorry.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.480
That one...

01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:15.350
It doesn't need to be washed.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.730
Today, have some free time in town.

01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:25.110
Yes, but I'm leaving at the end of the week.

01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.820
Today I need to go to the hospital.

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:33.950
Don't peek.

01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:34.970
I'm sorry.

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.510
The Hospital can't keep up.

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:41.170
Our doctor is very busy.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.800
You can get a doctor's statement in Hiroshima.

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.240
Just don't buy your tickets now.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.130
Here, a gift from your sister.

01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:56.130
I made some pants.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.400
I sewed an elastic band so you could wear it by yourself.

01:41:59.510 --> 01:42:01.660
Sorry if it's a little crooked.

01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:05.170
Thank you so much.

01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:13.620
Forgive me, I shouldn't have blamed you for Harumi.

01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:15.660
No problem.

01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:20.930
Kuromura Watchmaker Shop

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.000
I lost my beloved husband early.

01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:23.070
My house got destroyed.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.970
I couldn't see my son.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.910
But still, I chose my own path.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.240
You're different. You obediently moved to an unfamiliar house.

01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:38.560
You do what you're told.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.680
It must be a very boring life.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:51.440
Maybe your cherished place is not here but somewhere else.

01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.880
Anyway, it's up to you to decide.

01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:09.440
Keiko, what was that flash?

01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:14.170
I don't know. It's like lightning but there's not a cloud in the sky.

01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.840
Still, can you help me wash this dress?

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.570
And yet...

01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:25.620
Can I stay here?

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:29.510
Yes you can, you can, let me go, it's hot.

01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:40.710
What was that?

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.080
I can't hear anything from JOFK.

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.460
Nothing?

01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:48.480
Hey!

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.170
Yes?

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.220
Come out, take a look!

01:43:55.330 --> 01:43:57.530
What is this cloud?

01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.930
Cloud?

01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:04.660
Do you see those huge clouds?
They are called anvils.

01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:12.400
This is Okuyama radio station. Hiroshima Station, respond. This is Okuyama radio station.

01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:17.880
I went to see what had fallen, and this is a transfer board from Hiroshima.

01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:28.680
Everyone who's not busy, go to the district council's building.

01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:32.660
Isn't Tita like a nurse?

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.820
But I've never done it before.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.530
We've never done this before.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:39.950
Is that right?

01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:40.510
Yes.

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.770
It's a shame to only have one hand.

01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:46.440
Are you making fun of me?

01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:49.260
Why do you need all those sandals?

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.420
We'll take them to Hiroshima. After the recent raids, the roads there are quite bad.

01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:55.110
Shoes and Geta are not suitable.

01:44:56.170 --> 01:44:57.400
Can I go?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.370
Wounded can't go.

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:02.680
My son was also recently transferred to Hiroshima.

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:05.150
Will you come with me on the truck tomorrow?

01:45:05.370 --> 01:45:10.130
The people of Hiroshima helped us when we were bombed, we also should...

01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:16.910
Look at all those braid. There's no problem with me.

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:17.840
You can't go!

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.200
Again with this? Let's finish it quickly and go home.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.240
Our family went to Hiroshima recently.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.480
They say they dropped a new kind of bomb on Hiroshima.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.910
It's a...

01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:33.280
Suzu, is your family...

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.620
Mom!

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.020
People were also sent to the army base. But...

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:51.330
Did you also fly from Hiroshima?

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:09.170
He just sat here and died.

01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:12.260
Apparently, he came on foot from Hiroshima.

01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:17.220
We never found who he was. Both his face and body were burnt.

01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:19.640
Keep a secret from miss Hojo.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.280
It's a scary poor thing to look at.

01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:30.310
I collected the eucalyptus leaves.
They help with the mosquitoes.

01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.970
Thank you. Hold on, be strong.

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:35.910
Yes.

01:46:36.150 --> 01:46:40.460
The Urano family from Eba: Jūrō, Kiseno and Sumi

01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:45.480
And the Morita Morita family from Kusatsu: Marino and Tizuko.

01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:51.880
I want to be strong. Kind and strong.

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.930
As the inhabitants of our city.

01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:59.350
Oh, come on! We will not succumb to your threats.

01:46:57.970 --> 01:47:02.390
August 9

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.620
Let me stay here.

01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:11.420
I was so worried and you're a fool. Fool! Fool! Fool!

01:47:12.110 --> 01:47:13.420
I'm sorry.

01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:16.260
I'm sorry.

01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:18.310
I'm really sorry.

01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:20.420
I'm sorry!

01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:22.040
I didn't manage to hit anything.

01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:24.910
I will become the laughingstock of the whole fleet.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:30.060
Suzu, why did you collect enemy flyers?

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:32.350
You're going to be lectured by the kempeitai.

01:47:33.170 --> 01:47:35.440
Even If you give them away, they will just burn them.

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:39.370
It's good paper, if you stretched it, it's fine for the toilet.

01:47:39.970 --> 01:47:44.110
Indeed. But you will have to not let other people into the toilet.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.570
We use everything to survive. This is our battle.

01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:49.570
Yeah...

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.530
August 15

01:47:51.150 --> 01:47:52.420
Come in, please.

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.640
Thank you.

01:47:55.550 --> 01:48:02.770
Our first duty is to care for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods.

01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:12.600
For the sake of the great peace for all generations to come, we must endure the unbearable.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:19.370
Strengthen the courage of the spirit, work hard to exalt the glory of the imperial state.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:24.240
You just listened to the Emperor's message to the people.

01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:24.600
It's all over.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.920
But it comes out...

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.170
that we lost.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.170
How's that?

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:33.550
They dropped these terrible bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:37.170
And the Soviets entered the war, what can you do...

01:48:38.330 --> 01:48:40.540
How can you say that?

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.770
Shouldn't we fight to the last?

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:46.550
There are five of us living here!

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.930
My left hand is in place, and so are both my feet!

01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.350
Harumi!

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.370
Harumi!

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.990
They are flying away.

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.060
Everything that we thought was right before.

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.680
Everything for which we have endured so much.

01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:25.510
What about rice from behind the sea? And soybeans?

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:29.150
Our lives depended on them.

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:33.460
Is it possible to drop on your hands in front of brute force?

01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:41.260
It would be better to die and don't know anything.

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:58.840
I hid it to eat together when the last day comes.

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:03.060
Today we will eat pure rice.

01:50:03.550 --> 01:50:09.150
But not all of it. We'll leave some for tomorrow and the next day.

01:50:14.850 --> 01:50:18.910
And after the fifteenth of August came the sixteenth.

01:50:20.170 --> 01:50:21.790
And then the seventeenth.

01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:24.200
And then September.

01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:26.680
And October.

01:50:27.710 --> 01:50:29.350
And November, like last year.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:33.370
And the year before that and like ten years ago.

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:36.750
The same as always.

01:50:48.150 --> 01:50:50.530
It's so white and shiny.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:52.530
But we got nothing else.

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:53.840
It's all right.

01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:55.330
And Shūsaku?

01:50:55.710 --> 01:50:56.280
He's working.

01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:01.150
It's the duty of the Legal Service to maintain order with the troops.

01:51:01.930 --> 01:51:03.400
Let's eat.

01:51:05.970 --> 01:51:08.710
The bombings have stopped so the fish are no longer dying.

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.480
That's correct.

01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:24.150
What are we doing?

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:26.600

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.350
I'm being transferred to Otake.

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:46.330
Until the fleet is dissolved.

01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:50.530
The Legal Service will
be needed to keep order.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.310
If I had two hands,

01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:59.800
I would hold on to him and share his unease.

01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:02.880
The streets are empty.

01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:04.400

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:39.770
I don't know. What difference does it make?

01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:41.770

01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:43.710

And Harumi would have done the same thing.

Our food is completely tasteless.

01:53:22.570 --> 01:53:27.510
I showed the way to the American soldiers and they gave me some chocolate.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:31.110

02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:09.840
When rainy thorns are gone

02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:33.280
To you, this world

02:03:33.710 --> 02:03:38.270
What does it look like?

02:03:38.490 --> 02:03:42.840
Here I am taking roots

02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:48.000
With a sigh in the middle of a dream

02:03:48.000 --> 02:04:03.740
The fluff fills the sky far away

02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:07.600
Skip it.

02:04:30.330 --> 02:04:35.120
A wish that cannot be fulfilled

02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:39.600
A feelings that never reach

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.200
Become a deep deep color

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:50.890
To dye me gently

02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:56.510
Over that roof.

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:01.340
To the next town

02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:11.020
To the garden of someone I don't know

02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:16.190
Some of them are stepped on

02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.680
Some of them are on the ship.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:31.180
If you can reach your shoulder

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:53.850
A small fire is burning.

02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:58.540
There's no sound in the soil

02:05:59.550 --> 02:06:03.860
When the time comes for a free tomorrow

02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:11.480
I'm sure I'll see you.
