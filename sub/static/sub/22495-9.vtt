00:38.799 --> 00:41.970
You know, Lois, Krypto might
need a little snip-snip.

00:42.773 --> 00:43.805
Sorry, old buddy.

00:43.841 --> 00:45.340
Got to do it.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.636
It's for your own good, Krypto!

00:46.859 --> 00:49.426
It'll reduce the probability
of perianal adenomas!

00:49.461 --> 00:51.696
That's ass cancer!

00:51.765 --> 00:54.166
Sit! Sit!

00:56.070 --> 01:02.174
Oww! Let go of my...Those balls are coming
off whether you like it or not!

01:02.210 --> 01:04.510
Gonna assume you don't like it.

01:04.546 --> 01:05.179
There now.

01:05.214 --> 01:06.547
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:14.588 --> 01:16.155
Can I take your order, please?

01:16.191 --> 01:17.523
Yeah. Can I get a what-what?

01:17.559 --> 01:18.691
What-what!

01:19.126 --> 01:20.159
Man, I'm thirsty.

01:21.129 --> 01:21.795
Watch this.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.165
Hey, kool-aid!

01:25.200 --> 01:26.333
Just give it a second.

01:26.368 --> 01:26.900
Yeah.

01:26.935 --> 01:29.904
Your imagination is a pretty
piss-poor solution to my thirst,

01:29.940 --> 01:35.310
and the kitchen is literally 10 feet away, so...
You're just like my real dad,

01:35.378 --> 01:36.377
kool-aid.

01:36.413 --> 01:37.846
You never show up.

01:43.754 --> 01:44.855
Dora!

01:44.890 --> 01:45.755
Dora!

01:45.791 --> 01:46.690
Wha-a-a-a-at?!

01:46.758 --> 01:48.858
It's almost time for your quinceaÃ±era!

01:48.893 --> 01:50.393
I need you to run to the store!

01:54.132 --> 01:55.465
Fine!

01:59.003 --> 02:02.472
Soda, cookies, horchata... barf!

02:02.507 --> 02:04.240
Help me out!

02:04.276 --> 02:07.844
Which beer has the highest
alcohol by volume?

02:08.948 --> 02:09.880
Good choice!

02:09.949 --> 02:13.250
Uh, Dora, you're not old
enough to buy that.

02:13.286 --> 02:14.318
No [bleep]

02:14.353 --> 02:15.786
Dora, please, no!

02:15.855 --> 02:16.754
It's wrong!

02:17.691 --> 02:20.058
Now let's complete this transaction!

02:20.093 --> 02:21.426
Hey! Stop that kid!

02:21.495 --> 02:23.027
I need your help again!

02:23.063 --> 02:26.698
I need everybody to shout, "Where
my mother [bleep] map at?"

02:27.467 --> 02:29.968
Aw, yeah!

02:30.004 --> 02:32.671
Map, show me where to
find my friend Marcus!

02:32.706 --> 02:33.905
He's always holding.

02:33.974 --> 02:37.709
I, uh -- I don't know, Dora.

02:39.514 --> 02:40.279
Okay, okay!

02:40.315 --> 02:43.049
He's at the park on 12th,
under the jungle gym!

02:43.084 --> 02:45.451
He said he might have some "X," too.

02:45.487 --> 02:48.154
You can call me Dora the X-plorer!

02:49.090 --> 02:50.524
Hey!

02:50.559 --> 02:51.959
I need your help!

02:51.994 --> 02:55.095
Paulo or Maria?

02:56.632 --> 02:58.599
No argument here!

03:02.672 --> 03:05.273
Just call me the virginity swiper.

03:05.342 --> 03:07.475
Swiper, no swiping!

03:07.511 --> 03:09.377
Swiper, no swiping!

03:09.446 --> 03:11.512
You're too late!

03:11.548 --> 03:14.448
Oh, man!

03:14.517 --> 03:18.086
I wish boots was here to see our
little girl become a woman!

03:18.154 --> 03:20.622
Monkeys are cute when they're little.

03:20.657 --> 03:22.657
But boots got big.

03:22.692 --> 03:24.292
<i>Oh, hello, boots!</i>

03:26.964 --> 03:27.929
<i>Get away!</i>

03:27.965 --> 03:28.797
<i>My God!</i>

03:29.967 --> 03:30.999
Oh, my God!

03:31.034 --> 03:33.102
Dora's on the roof!

03:33.170 --> 03:35.537
I bet I can fly.

03:35.573 --> 03:38.741
Do you think I can fly?

03:38.809 --> 03:42.444
I've never been able to hear you!!

03:42.480 --> 03:45.014
It's the show's big lie!!

03:45.049 --> 03:46.182
Whoo-hoo!

03:47.452 --> 03:50.119
Aah, she missed the pool.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.021
Bass with a bass.

03:53.056 --> 03:54.556
Bass with a bass.

03:54.591 --> 03:57.092
Bass -- bass with a bass.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.571
That ghost is awesome, dude!

04:42.607 --> 04:44.040
Play it again!

04:46.877 --> 04:48.478
So, you're a shirt tale.

04:48.513 --> 04:49.612
That must be fun.

04:49.648 --> 04:51.247
Yeah, it's pretty great.

04:51.949 --> 04:53.415
And what do you do again?

04:53.484 --> 04:56.251
Oh, uh, I'm the I.T. manager for
a furniture supply company.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.688
We make those things you put on table
legs so they don't scratch the floor.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.757
Wow, that is really interesting.

05:02.493 --> 05:04.232
Uh, are you having a good time?

05:04.352 --> 05:05.894
Yeah! Totally!

05:06.597 --> 05:08.864
Can I get you two anything else?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.700
Oh, um, do you want dessert?

05:10.768 --> 05:12.368
Ah, no. Nothing, thanks.

05:20.144 --> 05:21.711
I didn't kill my wife!

05:21.779 --> 05:23.546
I don't care!

05:23.615 --> 05:24.613
<i>And there's the jump!</i>

05:24.649 --> 05:25.448
<i>Strong take off.</i>

05:25.516 --> 05:27.817
<i>He moves from the classic
forward approach and hurdle</i>

05:27.885 --> 05:28.984
<i>to the open pike position.</i>

05:29.053 --> 05:31.520
<i>There's the tuck, the twist,
and... a fairly clean entry,</i>

05:31.555 --> 05:32.788
<i>despite the roaring waterfall.</i>

05:32.823 --> 05:33.989
<i>Let's check with the judges.</i>

05:34.058 --> 05:36.731
<i>Dr. Richard Kimble
takes home a score of 27.</i>

05:36.851 --> 05:38.229
<i>He's got to be happy about that.</i>

05:38.264 --> 05:40.597
<i>But we remind viewers he
probably killed his wife, and</i>

05:40.666 --> 05:43.923
<i>if you have any information on his
whereabouts, please call the police.</i>

05:44.043 --> 05:44.976
<i>I am Cornholio.</i>

05:45.045 --> 05:46.984
<i>I need teepee for my bunghole.</i>

05:47.104 --> 05:49.772
<i>Get the [bleep] out of
here, running joke.</i>

05:49.892 --> 05:50.881
<i>Man, I'm thirsty.</i>

05:50.995 --> 05:52.061
<i>Watch this.</i>

05:52.096 --> 05:54.063
<i>Hey, kool-aid!</i>

05:56.367 --> 05:58.334
<i>Hey, kids! I'm silk!</i>

05:58.402 --> 06:03.139
<i>I'm just like milk, except soy-based,
to prevent nasty lactose diarrhea!</i>

06:03.175 --> 06:04.490
<i>Oh, hey, silk!</i>

06:04.610 --> 06:06.776
<i>I'd love a tall, cool glass of
get the [bleep] out of here!</i>

06:06.812 --> 06:07.977
<i>B-but --
Leave!</i>

06:08.013 --> 06:08.978
<i>But --
Go!</i>

06:09.047 --> 06:10.179
<i>But I --
Split!</i>

06:10.248 --> 06:11.181
<i>Aw!</i>

06:16.755 --> 06:17.887
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

06:17.956 --> 06:18.988
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

06:19.057 --> 06:20.823
<i>We can still cuddle, right?</i>

06:21.291 --> 06:22.358
<i>Ready!</i>

06:22.393 --> 06:23.459
<i>Aim!</i>

06:23.494 --> 06:24.360
<i>Fire!</i>

06:26.197 --> 06:27.362
<i>Ready!</i>

06:27.431 --> 06:28.363
<i>Aim!</i>

06:28.432 --> 06:29.464
<i>Fire!</i>

06:31.268 --> 06:33.162
<i>Let's never do that again!</i>

06:33.282 --> 06:35.536
<i>Plot a course for "Get us
the [bleep] out of here."</i>

06:36.004 --> 06:38.739
<i>There once was a bird
with a very happy life.</i>

06:38.775 --> 06:41.542
<i>He had a nice nest, a
nice car, hot wife.</i>

06:41.611 --> 06:44.979
<i>But one day he gave his bedroom
door a push, to see a bird in</i>

06:45.014 --> 06:47.649
<i>her hand and two in the bush.</i>

06:47.684 --> 06:51.085
<i>The next day at his job as a
bird on "The Wire," he showed up</i>

06:51.153 --> 06:53.721
<i>too late, and his boss
said, "You're fired!"</i>

06:53.757 --> 06:56.157
<i>On his drive home, on the radio feed...</i>

06:56.192 --> 06:59.293
<i>The fat pigs on Wall
Street have all the seed!</i>

06:59.328 --> 07:02.296
<i>And on the TV, more menacing words.</i>

07:02.364 --> 07:05.365
<i>This land's for the
pigs, not for the birds.</i>

07:05.401 --> 07:10.003
<i>His nest repossessed, to his family,
a stranger, he felt a new feeling.</i>

07:10.072 --> 07:11.838
<i>Could this be... anger?</i>

07:11.907 --> 07:15.008
<i>He found other birds with
ruffled up feathers, and said,</i>

07:15.044 --> 07:17.256
<i>"If you're mad as hell,
then let's flock together!"</i>

07:17.376 --> 07:22.382
<i>They loaded him into a gigantic sling
aimed at the palace of the evil pig king.</i>

07:22.417 --> 07:25.485
<i>He sailed towards the
tyrants, blocking the sun!</i>

07:25.521 --> 07:28.021
<i>The bird revolution had finally begun!</i>

07:31.058 --> 07:32.359
<i>Aw, dang it.</i>

07:33.996 --> 07:34.561
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:36.898 --> 07:37.831
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Oh, man.</i>

07:38.567 --> 07:40.272
<i>That's hilarious!</i>

07:40.392 --> 07:42.272
<i>Hey, did you ever see
"A Christmas Story"?</i>

07:44.638 --> 07:45.638
<i>Oh, man!</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:47.273
<i>The water main broke!</i>

07:47.308 --> 07:49.784
<i>This wet t-shirt contest is canceled!</i>

07:49.904 --> 07:51.477
<i>Not so fast!</i>

07:51.512 --> 07:53.112
<i>Hey, kool-aid!</i>

07:53.147 --> 07:53.946
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

07:53.981 --> 07:56.782
<i>You kids made a responsible,
non-alcoholic choice!</i>

07:56.851 --> 07:57.483
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

07:57.518 --> 07:58.683
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

07:58.752 --> 08:00.685
<i>Oh [bleep]</i>

08:00.721 --> 08:02.787
<i>Kool-aid stains, you
dumb mother [bleep]</i>

08:02.856 --> 08:05.123
<i>This is my grandmother's t-shirt!</i>

08:05.591 --> 08:09.060
<i>Thomas the Tank Engine was huffing
and puffing, when suddenly --</i>

08:09.096 --> 08:10.061
<i>Bust my buffers!</i>

08:10.130 --> 08:12.329
<i>This isn't the way to
the Whistling Woods!</i>

08:12.364 --> 08:13.497
<i>No, it ain't, pal!</i>

08:13.532 --> 08:16.466
<i>Unless the mayor of Sodor gives
me 100 million bucks, we're</i>

08:16.502 --> 08:19.803
<i>gonna drive this dynamite
right into Knapford station!</i>

08:19.805 --> 08:21.096
<i>Uh, we've got a problem.</i>

08:21.216 --> 08:23.340
<i>Get me Sir Topham Hatt.</i>

08:23.375 --> 08:24.841
<i>And you...</i>

08:24.876 --> 08:26.042
<i>You come back later.</i>

08:26.111 --> 08:27.877
<i>You know my schedule, dear.</i>

08:27.912 --> 08:28.945
<i>Okay, people.</i>

08:28.980 --> 08:30.680
<i>This is what we trained for.</i>

08:31.616 --> 08:32.615
<i>So immature.</i>

08:32.650 --> 08:34.417
<i>Can we all just stay on track?</i>

08:35.352 --> 08:37.220
<i>Let's just get this bastard!</i>

08:41.491 --> 08:42.857
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

08:52.701 --> 08:53.701
<i>Hello, Percy!</i>

08:53.737 --> 08:54.802
<i>Hello, Thomas!</i>

08:54.838 --> 08:57.438
<i>Wonderful weather for a
hijacking, isn't it?</i>

08:57.473 --> 09:01.408
<i>Shut your steam hole and get closer!</i>

09:01.444 --> 09:03.411
<i>I love being really useful!</i>

09:06.381 --> 09:10.084
<i>You'll never take me
alive, Sir Topham Hatt!</i>

09:11.187 --> 09:12.152
<i>Missed me!</i>

09:13.188 --> 09:14.888
<i>Your blows are harmless!</i>

09:14.924 --> 09:16.591
<i>My internal organs!</i>

09:17.627 --> 09:19.794
<i>Just finish me, you pussies!</i>

09:22.486 --> 09:23.819
<i>Conductor to Skywolf.</i>

09:23.854 --> 09:24.753
<i>Request pickup.</i>

09:24.822 --> 09:26.288
<i>Copy that. I'm on my way.</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:27.756
<i>Harold the helicopter?</i>

09:27.792 --> 09:29.092
<i>You're</i> a part of this?

09:29.127 --> 09:30.026
That's right.

09:30.095 --> 09:33.296
I'm tired of taking a back seat
to a bunch of steam trains.

09:33.331 --> 09:35.298
I can [bleep] fly!

09:37.034 --> 09:38.935
So long, Topham!

09:47.979 --> 09:48.578
Aah!

09:48.647 --> 09:52.949
What cruel God would
give a train a face?!

09:53.018 --> 09:56.486
Pump those pistons, you
steam-powered son of a bitch!

10:01.024 --> 10:02.391
Topham! Help me!

10:02.426 --> 10:04.359
I'll turn myself in, I swear.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.594
Just pull me up!

10:05.629 --> 10:08.029
End of the line, [bleep] head.

10:11.433 --> 10:12.767
Thank you, everyone!

10:12.836 --> 10:14.302
Knapford station is safe!

10:14.337 --> 10:16.037
You're quite welcome, mayor!

10:16.106 --> 10:18.674
And how did you dispose
of the dynamite?

10:18.709 --> 10:20.576
Uhhhh...

10:24.286 --> 10:26.537
_

10:26.657 --> 10:29.067
_

10:29.187 --> 10:29.953
Whew!

10:30.022 --> 10:32.122
I've got a lot of work to do!

10:32.158 --> 10:33.290
