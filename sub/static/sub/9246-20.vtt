[instrumental music]

00:04.482 --> 00:06.528
I can't decide
between a veil or a hat.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.269
I mean, I wanna look elegant,
but with a, you know

00:08.356 --> 00:10.793
sense of whimsy.
Traditional, but fun.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.838
Maybe they have one
of those beer can hats

00:12.925 --> 00:17.234
but for champagne flutes.
That's elegant and fun.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.628
Victoria, my wedding is in
three weeks and you're either

00:19.715 --> 00:22.065
part of the problem
or you're part of the solution.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.589
Don't upset your sister.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.722
I think the veil
you're wearing is gorgeous.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.811
- I hate it.
- I hate it too.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.205
Here we are.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.945
[in unison]
Oh!

00:33.033 --> 00:37.037
- It's so beautiful.
- Amazing.

00:37.124 --> 00:40.040
Oh, my God.
I think I'm gonna cry.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.652
Where the hell are the wrist
loops to carry the train?

00:43.739 --> 00:45.828
The seamstress will add those
after this final fitting.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.699
Information, communication.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.658
That is the only way
this is gonna work.

00:51.094 --> 00:53.966
Just fork it over.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.578
She's got a little case
of the pre-wedding jitters.

00:56.665 --> 00:59.407
Yeah, this morning,
she made the florist cry.

00:59.494 --> 01:02.410
He said it was allergies,
but we all knew.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.194
What we're saying is,
it's been a long day already

01:04.281 --> 01:07.589
so keep the free hooch flowing.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.112
I'll grab you another bottle.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.853
Just so you know,
three is the limit.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.029
Then three it shall be.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.250
[sighs]

01:16.337 --> 01:18.730
Appreciate you coming along
with us today.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.123
Having an eyewitness
kept me from killing her

01:20.210 --> 01:21.516
about four times.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.736
Do what you need to do, mom.
I'm no snitch.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.695
She's gonna be a beautiful
bride, though, isn't she?

01:26.782 --> 01:28.218
Oh. Absolutely.

01:28.305 --> 01:31.569
- So happy for her.
- Yeah.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.224
Until about two years ago,
I'd have bet cash money

01:34.311 --> 01:36.487
she was gonna be one
of those cranky, old spinsters

01:36.574 --> 01:39.795
in sensible shoes
and a boy's haircut.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.101
Living in a mobile home

01:41.188 --> 01:43.538
filled with stacks
of old Redbook magazines

01:43.625 --> 01:46.584
and 25 uncaged parakeets.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.064
We'd go visit her
on the weekends.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.414
And walk through
her gauntlet of wind chimes

01:50.501 --> 01:53.765
and dream catchers, ignoring
the health department citations

01:53.852 --> 01:55.898
and her prominent chin whiskers.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.511
- Ta-da!
- There she is.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.818
The most beautiful bride
in the whole world.

02:02.905 --> 02:06.822
- Not too shabby, right?
- You look amazing.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.606
Let's get you zipped up.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.654
Okay.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.483
Alright.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.093
Oh!

02:17.180 --> 02:18.747
Looks like we might need
to let this out just a smidge.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.792
No, you won't,
I am just a few pounds

02:20.879 --> 02:22.446
from my target weight
and when I set a goal

02:22.533 --> 02:24.361
for myself, I-I reach it.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.276
Honey, the wedding
is in three weeks.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.017
Which means
I'm right on schedule.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.802
I am gonna drop
those last six pounds

02:30.889 --> 02:32.717
easy peasy lemon squeezy.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.066
Of course you will!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.460
Those six pounds
will be your bitch.

02:36.547 --> 02:37.940
Damn right, they will.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.550
Now, why don't you
go get changed

02:39.637 --> 02:41.770
and I'll take my two girls
out for a nice lunch.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.859
Lunch?
I have six pounds to lose.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.035
Am I in this by myself?

02:47.471 --> 02:49.169
Back up. Back up.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.261

Mike, come on. Get out of bed.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.854
What's wrong?
Is the house on fire?

03:22.941 --> 03:25.727
Wake me when it gets
to the stairs.

03:25.814 --> 03:28.599
Get up. You and I
are going for a two-mile run.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.167
Alright, sweetie,
I think you're sleepwalking.

03:31.254 --> 03:32.603
Just climb back into bed

03:32.690 --> 03:34.475
and don't pee
in the clothes hamper.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.261
We are getting
married in three weeks

03:38.348 --> 03:40.089
and you and I
are gonna tone up.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.570
Hey, we Biggs don't tone,
and we don't tan.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.224
We burn, and we stroke out.

Honey roasted peanuts.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.932
You think Molly
will be tempted by these?

03:57.019 --> 03:58.107
You remember what happened
the last time

03:58.194 --> 03:59.456
she starved herself.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.893
She ate half a jar
of my avocado face scrub.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.940
In her defense,
it does look like guacamole.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.681
That may be but a sane woman

04:06.768 --> 04:08.335
doesn't dig around
her mother's makeup kit

04:08.422 --> 04:09.684
looking for a snack.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.122
What's going on?

04:13.209 --> 04:15.385
Molly's trying to drop
six pounds before the wedding

04:15.472 --> 04:17.605
so we're getting rid of
everything but ice and onions.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.303
If she's really serious
about this weight loss thing

04:20.390 --> 04:21.609
starving herself
is not the answer.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.306
Oh, she's exercising too.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.395
She's out right now jogging
around the neighborhood.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.223
Not talking diet and exercise.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.094
I'm referring
to the weight loss miracle

known as horse laxatives.

- Vince, don't be an ass.
- I'm serious.

who sometimes has to drop

04:35.449 --> 04:37.320

04:37.407 --> 04:40.758
All he needs is one cap full
of hiyo, silver and a good book.

to...take a day off.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.730
...reattach themselves
to the bone.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.428
No, you can't have a day off.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.125
It's all about speeding up
your metabolism.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.997
Now, I'm gonna go
take a shower and make us

05:02.084 --> 05:04.304
a nice, healthy smoothie
out of beets, carrots and kale.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.175
That's my reward
for running in the dark

05:06.262 --> 05:08.612
and giving myself
a two and a half mile wedgie?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.224

- Yeah.

an empty milk jug in the car

spending my entire day

porta-potties and big trees.

of bed at 5 o'clock

this morning to go jogging.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.946
Oh, that was you?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.034
I have to call my roommates
and tell them

05:39.121 --> 05:40.514
it wasn't Godzilla.

05:41.689 --> 05:42.994
I have hot coffee
in my hand

05:43.081 --> 05:45.519
and I'm going on
about five hours of sleep.

05:45.606 --> 05:47.042
Boy, someone woke up
on the wrong side of Tokyo

05:47.129 --> 05:48.435
this morning.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.742
I'm guessing
this new fitness regime

05:51.829 --> 05:53.440
has something to do
with your impending nuptials.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.311
She's driving me crazy, Carl.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.443
I don't know why
she's making

05:56.530 --> 05:58.140
such a big deal
out of a wedding.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.534
Hey, this is a huge milestone
in a woman's life.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.100
It's something she's been
dreaming and fantasizing

06:02.187 --> 06:03.450
about since she was
a young girl.

06:03.537 --> 06:04.755
But it's just one day.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.757
One day
she will remember forever.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.542
For me and you,
that's like the first time

06:08.629 --> 06:10.065
we ever saw
a real-life naked boob.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.067
October 6, 1988.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.810
Joy Harmon was her name.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.768
She was the first girl
in our class to get boobs

06:17.855 --> 06:20.249
and I was the third guy
to see them.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.859
And I bet you the time
leading up to that was filled

06:21.946 --> 06:22.860
with hope and expectation.

06:22.947 --> 06:23.992
Oh, God, yes.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.036
She told me at lunch I could

06:25.123 --> 06:26.516
see one of them after school.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.213
I remember it was pizza day
and I left half of it

06:28.300 --> 06:29.432
on my plate.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.042
Hey, that speaks volumes
right there.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.393
When the bell rang, I ran

06:33.480 --> 06:34.611
to meet her
underneath the bleachers.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.221
My heart was pounding
with anticipation.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.527
Of course it was.

06:37.614 --> 06:38.746
There can be
no other first time

06:38.833 --> 06:40.225
and you wanted it to be perfect.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.662
And it was.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.141
I could tell she liked me
'cause she showed me

06:43.228 --> 06:44.708
the second one
without me even asking.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.710
And that's after I drooled
all over the first one.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.104
Mmm. Yeah.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.845
Can't see one without the other.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.630
It's like
the "Kill Bill" movies.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.111
They were like
two perfect pieces of flan.

06:56.198 --> 07:00.245
You know, if you put
a Hershey's kiss on each one.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.943
Now, if you'd like to get
into your bride's head

07:02.030 --> 07:04.511
a little bit, just change
boobs to holy matrimony

07:04.598 --> 07:06.208
and you can understand
where she's coming from.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.036
Wow, I always knew
it was important to her

07:08.123 --> 07:10.517
but I never realized
it consumed her every thought

07:10.604 --> 07:13.345
and dictated her every action.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.173
Well, sometimes you gotta
step back and look at things

07:15.260 --> 07:17.872
from an intellectual standpoint.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.351
Thanks for helping me
understand.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.831
No problem.

07:20.918 --> 07:22.616
So I'm guessing
Joy Harmon is the reason

07:22.703 --> 07:24.705
you always order
two pieces of flan?

07:24.792 --> 07:27.925
You know, I hope one day
Molly gets me the way you do.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.322
Alright, here we go.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.498
Oh..

07:35.585 --> 07:38.675
Feeling good. Feeling good.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.895
Feeling good. Oh..

07:40.982 --> 07:43.767
Whoops.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.466
Hello, old friend.
We meet again.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.993
Alright, stop. Stop.

Stop, stop!

07:53.864 --> 07:55.736
Son of a bitch!

07:58.129 --> 07:59.566
'Liar!'

07:59.653 --> 08:01.785
Uh-oh. She's arguing
with the scale again.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.787
Just so you know,
when the pothead ties the knot

08:03.874 --> 08:06.137
we're gonna go live in a hotel.
Probably Europe.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.183
[Molly]
'Mom!'

08:08.270 --> 08:09.619
Down here, sweetie.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.535
Hide the chips
and try not to piss her off.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.015
The smoothie you made me
for dinner tonight

08:14.102 --> 08:16.104
did you put banana in it?

08:16.191 --> 08:19.194
'Cause I specifically
said no banana!

08:19.281 --> 08:20.978
Well, if you said no banana

08:21.065 --> 08:23.241
then there was not
a banana in there.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.678
There were two bananas
in the kitchen.

08:24.765 --> 08:25.940
If I go in there right now

08:26.027 --> 08:27.463
are there still
going to be two bananas?

08:27.550 --> 08:30.074
- Vince ate them.
- No, I didn't. I hate bananas.

08:30.161 --> 08:33.904
They got a weird texture,
and they make me look apish.

08:33.991 --> 08:37.081
You look apish holding a pen!

08:37.168 --> 08:39.562
One banana's not
gonna kill you, sweetie.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.434
It's pure starch,
and my glycemic index spikes.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.480
I mean, you might as well
fill the blender with fudge.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.221
'You're all trying
to sabotage me.'

08:46.308 --> 08:48.919
Don't even, pal. I see you.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.617
Hi, hon.
Did you have a good day?

08:50.704 --> 08:52.357
Grab your gym bag.
We're taking a spinning class.

08:52.444 --> 08:54.272
I just walked in the door.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.971
For the love of God, grab your
bag and get her outta here!

08:57.058 --> 08:59.234
If she looks in the trash
and finds two banana peels

08:59.321 --> 09:00.844
we're all dead!

09:02.237 --> 09:04.456
[instrumental music]

09:04.544 --> 09:06.458
You realize
this is a nightmare for me.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.244
I'm a fat guy in a little room
on a bike that goes nowhere.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.375
You don't get on that bike

09:10.462 --> 09:11.507
you're gonna have
a new nightmare.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.335
Alright, let's mount up.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.642
Oh, good,
the seats are really small.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.256
Remember not to stay
in the saddle the whole time.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.737
You need to move up and down
and lift with your core.

09:25.869 --> 09:29.351
This should put me on the fast
track to erectile dysfunction.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.962
I thank you for that.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.964
- Molly?
- Yeah.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.663
It's Allison.
We met at OA a couple years ago.

09:36.750 --> 09:40.797
Oh, my God. Allison.
Well, you look great.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.494
What'd you lose, like 40 pounds?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.106
- Fifty-two.
- Fifty-two.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.587
It took me almost three years,
but I did it.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.764
Well, I'm, I'm happy
for you, seriously.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.679
Oh, this is, uh,
my fiance, Mike.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.289
Hi.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.726
- Doesn't she look great?
- Sure.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.380
Fifty-two pounds.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.949
Well, you set a goal
and you hit it. Bully for you.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.603
The key is not to try
and lose it too quick.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.780
Absolutely. Yeah.

10:06.867 --> 10:10.131
That's what I'm always trying
to tell this guy over here.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.524
Slow and steady wins the race.
Don't I always say that?

10:12.612 --> 10:16.528
She does. Never in this context,
but it's a good rule anywhere.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.661
Those crash diets never work,
you try starving yourself

10:18.748 --> 10:20.228
you just end up
gaining more weight.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.493
Right. I say that too.
That's.. Yeah, yeah.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.973
Oh!

10:26.060 --> 10:30.412
I-I forgot my sports bra
in the car. I, uh..

10:30.499 --> 10:31.979
Looks like I'm wearing one
but that's just

10:32.066 --> 10:34.242
'cause they're
naturally...perky.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.070
- Excuse me.
- Where you going?

10:36.157 --> 10:37.158
Are you coming back?

10:37.245 --> 10:38.725
[upbeat music]

10:38.812 --> 10:40.814
Welcome, everybody.
Let's wake those legs up.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.077
Spin away the cares of the day.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.339
- 'In the saddle..'
- Ow!

10:44.426 --> 10:45.645
[female #1]
'Out of the saddle.'

10:45.732 --> 10:46.863
- 'In the saddle..'
- Ow!

10:46.950 --> 10:47.908
[female #1]
'Out of the saddle.'

10:47.995 --> 10:49.170
- 'In the the saddle..'
- Ow!

10:49.257 --> 10:50.606
[female #1]
'Out of the saddle.'

10:50.693 --> 10:52.434
[siren wailing in distance]

10:54.392 --> 10:57.308
"The key is tryin' to try
and not to lose it too quick."

10:57.395 --> 10:59.136
So smug.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.530
She has a tiny ass
and one chin.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.669
Come on, Biggs.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.627
I know you've got candy
in here somewhere.

11:16.588 --> 11:19.287
Come on, think like Mike, think
like Mike, think like Mike.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
Bup-bup-bup.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.208
Jackpot!

11:29.036 --> 11:30.951
[rustling wrapper]

11:36.434 --> 11:38.785
Thought you had me, didn't you?

11:38.872 --> 11:41.701
Not this time,
you fun-sized son of a bitch.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.316
Hey. Oh.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.405
Excuse me. You hit my car.

11:50.492 --> 11:53.190
Sorry, it's covered in dents
already and my car's fine

11:53.277 --> 11:54.757
so no big whoop.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.454
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa.
It's a whoop.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.066
It's a very big whoop.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.198
Come on,
I'm late for spin class.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.985
And, FYI, this parking lot
is for gym members only.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.770
Well, FYI, I am a gym member.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.685
[chuckles]
Of course you are.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.166
Look, how about I give you
five dollars

12:12.253 --> 12:14.908
buy yourself a slice of pizza,
we'll call it even.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.871
[car alarm wailing]

12:21.958 --> 12:23.655
Now we're even!

12:27.921 --> 12:29.009
You think you're so smart,
don't you?

12:29.096 --> 12:30.575
My boyfriend's a cop.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.752
He still needs a cheat sheet
for the microwave!

12:34.318 --> 12:35.755
- Molly?
- 'Mike!'

12:37.104 --> 12:38.627
- Molly!
- 'Mike!'

12:38.714 --> 12:40.934
Molly, you've got my keys!

12:41.021 --> 12:43.414
Ow! Ow! Ow..

12:46.417 --> 12:48.506
[dramatic music]

12:54.382 --> 12:56.688
I can't believe this!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.299
I've never been arrested
in my life.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.083
What'd you do?

13:00.170 --> 13:02.782
This woman in the parking lot
got very snotty with me

13:02.869 --> 13:06.437
I accidentally kicked off
her side view mirror.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.919
I admire your restraint.

13:10.006 --> 13:13.183
I once bit off a woman's earlobe
for giving me a bad manicure.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.623
Well, there's, uh...nothing
worse than a bad manicure.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.278
Yeah, I couldn't speak Korean

13:21.365 --> 13:23.280
so I opted for
the universal language of

13:23.367 --> 13:25.239
"I'm biting your ear off,
bitch!"

13:28.546 --> 13:30.635
Sure, a girl's
gotta make her point.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.162
If the gal's on angel dust
and bathtub crack

13:35.249 --> 13:37.033
it could take four cops
and a dog

13:37.120 --> 13:38.992
to get her off her soapbox.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.125
So what's your poison?

13:42.212 --> 13:43.779
Well, I've..

13:43.866 --> 13:45.955
...been on kind of
a crazy juice fast.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.739
And..

13:47.827 --> 13:50.090
...I'm not gonna lie to you,
I'm-I'm tweaking pretty bad.

13:53.702 --> 13:56.531
Oh, I am never so mean
as when I am hungry.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.750
I did four days on Jenny Craig

13:58.838 --> 14:01.231
lit my boyfriend's legs on fire.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.494
Oh, my God.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.061
I was actually
aiming for his junk

14:05.148 --> 14:07.237
but the welding torch sparked.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.850
Those things can be tricky.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.288
Other than that, though

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
did you have any success
on Jenny Craig?

14:19.075 --> 14:23.340
You know what, portion control
ain't my strong suit.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.255
Tell me about it,
when I open a can of Pringles

14:25.342 --> 14:27.214
I don't stop till I hit dust.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.000
I'm just so emotional lately

14:31.087 --> 14:32.784
and I'm getting married
in three weeks

14:32.872 --> 14:34.917
and I've been acting crazy.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.311
That's a stressful time.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.313
Lots of couples
can't take the pressure.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.707
Especially if you lit
the groom-to-be's legs on fire.

14:45.362 --> 14:49.366
I can see how that might
give a fella cold feet.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.151
Ironically.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
I-I just don't wanna give up.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.200
I've set a goal for myself
and, my God, I wanna meet it.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.639
Hopefully without
killing somebody.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.990
Or paying somebody else
to do it for you.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.776
I didn't hear a thing.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.127
[instrumental music]

15:13.129 --> 15:15.566
Oh. So, is everything okay?

15:15.653 --> 15:17.264
The woman agreed
to drop the charges

15:17.351 --> 15:19.744
if I paid for a new side view
mirror and a new brake light.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.486
That brake light was broken
before I kicked it!

15:24.227 --> 15:25.620
I said I believe you.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.665
Now, why don't you run upstairs
and take a shower.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.364
Not that he's trying
to tell you what to do.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.627
Nah, I would never do that.
Shower if you want.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.107
I mean, you did sit
in somebody's pee

15:34.194 --> 15:36.413
but it's your call.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.589
I'm gonna go take a shower.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.291
I don't know who that woman is!

15:44.378 --> 15:45.814
Keep your voice down.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.990
And if you're gonna cry,
cry in the kitchen.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.470
Thought I was marrying
a sweet little schoolteacher

15:49.557 --> 15:51.733
not some car-kicking lunatic.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.126
There's three weeks
until the wedding

15:53.213 --> 15:54.954
and Molly's already
been thrown in the pokey.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.305
At this rate, our honeymoon's
gonna be a conjugal visit!

15:58.392 --> 16:00.698
Ow!

16:00.785 --> 16:02.613
Buck up and sit down!

16:02.700 --> 16:04.311
Great, she's a kicker
and you're a hitter.

16:04.398 --> 16:06.530
What kind of family
am I marrying into?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.228
A loving, supportive one.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.099
And we are gonna help
my little angel

16:10.186 --> 16:11.971
look her best for her wedding.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.102
What if she doesn't
lose the weight?

16:13.189 --> 16:14.321
What if the dress doesn't fit?

16:14.408 --> 16:16.062
That is not an option!

16:18.151 --> 16:20.196
Please don't hit me again.

16:20.283 --> 16:21.850
Look, I've been
through this with her before.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.373
She gets her mind
set on something

16:23.460 --> 16:25.462
and God help anything
that gets in her way.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.942
Wait, so she's acted
this way before?

16:27.029 --> 16:29.249
Oh. Are you kidding me?

16:29.336 --> 16:33.122
Prom, senior picture day,
and one God-awful summer

16:33.209 --> 16:36.386
when she decided
to master the accordion.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.997
I didn't know
she could play the accordion.

16:38.084 --> 16:41.652
Umh, second runner-up,
Cook County Polka Festival

16:41.739 --> 16:44.090
pre-teen division.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.788
Three worst days of my life.

16:46.875 --> 16:49.095
So are you gonna go talk to her?

16:49.182 --> 16:50.879
I've had a lifetime
of talking to her.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.882
You're gonna be her husband,
so now it's your turn.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.492
Take this to your future bride.

16:55.579 --> 16:57.059
Sleepy time tea.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.670
- Always calms her down.
- Okay.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.412
Sometimes I find it's helpful
to drop an Ambien in

17:02.499 --> 17:04.458
just to make sure
crazy goes night-night.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.596
What the hell?
Nobody gains weight in prison!

17:17.906 --> 17:19.560
Knock, knock.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.170
Brought you your tea.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.042
Put an ice cube in there
so it's not so hot

17:23.129 --> 17:25.696
in case you spill it
or it gets thrown.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.439
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

17:29.526 --> 17:31.789
What? I don't think that.
I certainly wouldn't say that.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.965
If I did, who'd be
the crazy one then, right?

17:35.271 --> 17:36.838
I'm so caught up
in this wedding

17:36.925 --> 17:39.623
and I know
I'm driving everybody nuts.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.147
You've been
a little off your game

17:41.234 --> 17:43.062
but I don't think
anyone else has noticed.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.194
Come on.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.935
Few cops,
couple of eyewitnesses

17:47.022 --> 17:49.546
but for all they know,
you're like that all the time.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.289
I'm sorry to put you
through all this.

17:53.376 --> 17:56.640
I just, I wanted to look perfect
for you on our wedding day.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.427
Are you kidding?

18:00.514 --> 18:03.908
You look perfect to me
all the time.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.693
Whether it's just waking up
in the morning

18:05.780 --> 18:07.608
wearing one
of my football jerseys

18:07.695 --> 18:10.698
or cleaning the garage
in those goofy-looking overalls

18:10.785 --> 18:13.614
or this whole gypsy
fortune-teller thing

18:13.701 --> 18:15.572
you got going on here.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.489
Listen..

18:19.576 --> 18:21.404
...you don't have to squeeze
into some wedding dress

18:21.491 --> 18:22.927
to look perfect to me.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.193
You're already the most
beautiful woman in the world.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.719
- I love you.
- I love you too.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.638
Come on, let's get into bed.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.727
I know better than to argue
with a crazy woman.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.163
We gotta get up bright
and early if we're gonna get

18:41.250 --> 18:42.469
in those three miles.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.645
Wait, did you not
hear a word I just said?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.299
I am getting married
in three weeks and

18:46.386 --> 18:47.822
I'm gonna fit
in that freaking wedding dress

18:47.909 --> 18:49.432
if it kills us all!

18:51.434 --> 18:52.696
God, what's it gonna be like
when she's pregnant?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.655
- 'Mike!'
- Coming!

18:54.742 --> 18:56.135
[instrumental music]

19:01.488 --> 19:04.099
- Okay, which button is it?
- It's the red one, mother.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.672
Alright, Molly,
play it for mommy.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.500
[polka music]

19:15.589 --> 19:19.070
That's beautiful.
Is that, uh, "Fra re Jacques?"

19:19.158 --> 19:22.857
"Beer barrel polka," mother.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.641
Wow, it's like having
Lawrence Welk

19:24.728 --> 19:26.861
in the living room.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.951
- Isn't she good, Victoria?
- Amazing!

19:33.737 --> 19:35.478
Okay, sweetie, you keep playing.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.306
Mommy's gonna make us
all some lunch.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.656
No, mom,
I'm getting to the best part!

19:39.743 --> 19:42.050
You're gonna miss the best part!

19:42.137 --> 19:44.835
Okay, I'll stay.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.708
Victoria, get mama's vodka
out of the freezer.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.275
Amazing!
