02:16.320 --> 02:18.277
Hang in there, Sergeant.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.919
American heroism has a new face today.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.037
Despite heavy enemy fire,

02:27.120 --> 02:30.909
a young infantryman rushes to the aid
of his fallen sergeant.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.435
This now-famous image
was captured on a camera

02:33.520 --> 02:35.637
abandoned by an embedded reporter

02:35.800 --> 02:41.159
during an ambush by anti-coalition forces
in Al-Ansakar, Diyala Province, Iraq.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.673
Nineteen-year-old Specialist William Lynn
was awarded the Silver Star,

02:45.800 --> 02:47.917
and he and the eight-man Bravo squad

02:48.080 --> 02:50.754
have spent the last two weeks
touring the country,

02:50.840 --> 02:52.832
receiving the nation's thanks.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.630
Their tour ends right here in Dallas,
where they'll be performing

02:56.760 --> 02:59.992
in Thursday's halftime show
alongside Destiny's Child.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.435
Hello?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.517
Hey, Billy. How's your head, buddy?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.518
- What?
- You get a good night's sleep?

03:18.600 --> 03:21.479
Yeah, those strippers last night
were really into you, man.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.199
What are you talking about?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.839
Hey, remember that halftime show
we're doing?

03:24.920 --> 03:26.320
- Shit!
- With Destiny's Child?

03:26.400 --> 03:27.720
Why don't you join us, dumbass?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.996
Here's the reason why people love this story.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.919
They give us hope,
they give us reason not to despair.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.630
Yeah.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.757
Six minutes and 40 seconds late.

03:36.840 --> 03:37.910
Yes.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.238
- Are you flakin' on me, Lynn?
- No, Sergeant.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.152
Just dreaming about cheerleaders.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.113
- Good man.
- I know it's not a popular war,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.271
and I know what's going on
in the media right now,

03:47.360 --> 03:49.875
but Bravo's a story about America
feeling good about America again.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.640
When the last time you felt good
about that, huh? Tell me.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.959
Dude! She really liked me.
She gave me a freebie.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.039
Sykes, you are so full of shit, man.
We were all wasted last night.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.635
I can't remember shit.
You sure as hell can't remember shit.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.558
Well, all I know is I got a free dance.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.798
We all got a free dance, boy.
Strippers love their country, too.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.075
What I'm saying is,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.277
there was a connection between us,
you know?

04:10.360 --> 04:11.476
Emotion and shit.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.110
That's her job, motherfucker.
Supposed to make you feel like they like you.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.077
Waitress, actress, stripper, prostitute.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.640
Go fuck yourself.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.358
Come on. At ease with the trash talk, fellas.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.080
- We're in front of civilians.
- Yeah. Hey, listen up, all of you.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.271
Right now,
by the grace of God and the media,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.352
we are the face of the American military,

04:27.440 --> 04:29.796
and you will act accordingly.
Do I make myself clear?

04:29.880 --> 04:31.030
Hooah!

04:31.360 --> 04:32.794
Man, we're gonna look ridiculous.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.837
Tell me about it, man. This whole tour's been

04:34.960 --> 04:36.713
one big dog-and-pony show
for the cameras, Sergeant.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.314
Those were just local appearances.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.040
At halftime, we will be performing
on national television

04:41.120 --> 04:42.952
in front of 40 million viewers.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.794
Now, if that happens to be
the mother of all clusterfucks,

04:45.880 --> 04:47.678
then we should blame it on bad intelligence.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.750
Inspiring words, Sergeant.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.638
No, they're not the...
No, they're not the elite force.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.955
No, they're a bunch of kids thrown into
the deep end of a not-so-popular war.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.110
And what do they do?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.476
They bond together with love
and brotherhood, that's what they do.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.597
You can't write that shit, man. Come on!

05:01.560 --> 05:02.880
You guys the Bravos?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.510
What gave us away?

05:06.080 --> 05:07.639
Sergeant David Dime.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.794
These are the men of 2nd Squad,
otherwise known to the media as "Bravo."

05:11.880 --> 05:14.156
Well, I'm Josh. I'm liaison from the team,

05:14.240 --> 05:16.197
so if you guys need anything today,
you just tell me.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.953
- I'll be taking care of you, all right?
- Hooah.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.679
Sykes would like his dignity back.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.513
- Crack needs to go fuck himself.
- Come on.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.069
This is Albert Brown,
producer extraordinaire.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.999
- How are you?
- Army set us up with him.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.992
You ever seen the "Fight Night" movies?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.312
- No.
- Well, you're missing out.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.552
He'll be rolling with us today.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.110
Is everybody here?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.476
- Present and accounted for.
- Wait, where's Major Mac?

05:37.560 --> 05:38.994
We're missing our public affairs coordinator.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.150
He's here, Sergeant.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.836
Major McLaurin, I'm Josh.
I'm gonna be taking care of you...

05:42.920 --> 05:43.910
He can't hear you.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.515
Major McLaurin was blown up
on the first day of his tour

05:46.600 --> 05:48.910
by an improvised explosive device.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.112
Twice. Lost his hearing.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.238
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.035
Well, here's your ride to the stadium.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.589
Courtesy of Mr. Oglesby.
So if you guys'll just...

06:01.040 --> 06:03.680
Wait, wait. Norm Oglesby sent this?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.792
Who the fuck is Norm Oglesby?

06:11.280 --> 06:13.351
All right, now,
that's what I'm talkin' about.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.079
- Just one little drink, Sergeant.
- No!

06:15.160 --> 06:16.196
But, Sergeant...

06:16.280 --> 06:19.159
Sykes, have you not had
your morning glass of shut-up?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.871
"Quietness, quietness over this countryside,

06:31.520 --> 06:34.194
"except for unmistakable signals on radio...

06:35.440 --> 06:37.591
"Has anyone looked in the eyes of the dead?

06:39.040 --> 06:42.431
"Is anyone living
to look for future forgiveness?"

06:47.400 --> 06:51.314
Well, I'm not much for poetry,
but this was one of Sergeant Breem...

06:51.400 --> 06:52.959
Shroom's favorites.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.070
I remember him
walking around base camp perimeter

06:56.160 --> 06:58.277
reciting this kind of stuff really loud.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.191
"Just sharing the wisdom," he said,

07:01.280 --> 07:03.476
when I'd tell him to shut the hell up.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.876
Maybe Shroom had a point.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.390
But personally, I believe
he was really using his voice

07:10.480 --> 07:13.120
to let the insurgents draw a bead on us
with their mortars,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.476
because that's the kind
of person Shroom was,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.552
always thinking of the other guy.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.559
Private Beckwith!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.116
Here, Sergeant!

07:23.200 --> 07:24.395
Sergeant Holliday!

07:24.640 --> 07:25.835
Here, Sergeant!

07:25.960 --> 07:27.235
Specialist Koch!

07:27.560 --> 07:28.960
Here, Sergeant!

07:29.280 --> 07:30.760
Specialist Yang!

07:30.840 --> 07:32.035
Here, Sergeant!

07:32.120 --> 07:33.349
Specialist Lynn!

07:33.520 --> 07:34.636
Here, Sergeant!

07:34.760 --> 07:35.750
Private Sykes!

07:35.880 --> 07:36.950
Here, Sergeant!

07:37.080 --> 07:38.639
Specialist Montoya!

07:38.840 --> 07:40.115
Here, Sergeant!

07:40.200 --> 07:42.032
Staff Sergeant Breem!

07:46.720 --> 07:48.712
Staff Sergeant Virgil Breem!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.633
Staff Sergeant Virgil Jeremiah Breem!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.117
Honor Guard! Attention!

08:04.120 --> 08:06.351
Ready! Aim!

08:06.880 --> 08:08.030
Fire!

08:08.920 --> 08:12.231
Ready! Aim! Fire!

08:24.320 --> 08:27.631
Aunt Marie said she hardly recognized you
on TV, you'd gotten so big.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.632
What's the Army been feedin' you?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.473
We order Domino's, mostly.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.676
It's easier than cooking.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.355
They don't really have those
over there, do they?

08:35.440 --> 08:38.717
Yeah. And free extra cheese
with every medal, right, Billy?

08:39.120 --> 08:40.315
Kathryn!

08:40.400 --> 08:42.517
Everyone in town's been asking about you.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.673
It's like we're celebrities.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.437
The neighbors all say how proud they are
of you and how grateful they are.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.957
Billy, you're not on duty, you're home,
so go put your dogs up.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.269
Yes, ma'am.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.352
Come help me get the casserole dish down.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.239
I'm makin' your favorite, chicken tetrazzini.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.232
Except I'm making it with turkey
instead of chicken

09:00.320 --> 09:01.834
since you can't be here for Thanksgiving.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.879
- I figure turkey's just as good, right?
- Turkey's just as good, Mom.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.840
And I have stocked the fridge
full of Cokes, Dr Pepper,

09:08.920 --> 09:11.116
sweet tea, all your favorites.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.870
Or we could slip out the back
and have a beer.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.155
Kathryn.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.519
Kathryn! Get in here and let your brother be!

09:20.640 --> 09:22.199
Change, though.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.040
You wear that to dinner,
and I'm gonna wear my prom dress.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.713
It's tempting.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.152
Hey, you, little man. What's up?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.035
You getting big and strong like your dad?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.475
Where's Pete?

09:37.560 --> 09:40.439
He's working a double shift.
He sends his regards.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.039
Billy.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.237
We've been praying for you, you know that?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.437
We're all so proud of you.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.719
...saw an opportunity and came here...

09:50.800 --> 09:53.031
- Him, too.
- ...overrunning the town and setting up

09:53.160 --> 09:55.117
- headquarters at the police station.
- In his way.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.989
Before dawn on Saturday,
Captain Brown's men,

09:58.120 --> 10:00.589
together with Iraqi forces,
some wearing masks,

10:00.720 --> 10:03.360
led an assault on the police station.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.436
Dad.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.070
After searching 24 hours,
the troops found nothing but a few guns.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.357
Locals say the insurgents
had already moved on.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.034
No drink on game day?

10:13.120 --> 10:16.591
No. No, Dan, I'm excited, too.
Yes, I'm excited. Yes.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.474
Talk to your client. I'll do my thing.
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.880
Hey, guys. Good news. Hey.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.440
- We got interest...
- Hey, listen up.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.477
Hey, we got interest from a major star.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.954
Matt Damon?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.315
- No.
- DiCaprio.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.720
- No.
- Matt Damon?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.154
I just said, "Matt Damon".

10:30.640 --> 10:32.518
Hey. Hey, this may not be a name

10:32.640 --> 10:35.075
that comes readily to mind
to you guys, but hear me out.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.355
- Hear me out.
- All right.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.590
Hilary Swank.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.080
- Whoa.
- What?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.590
She won an Oscar playing a guy
in Boys Don't Cry.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.433
Well, she played a girl
pretending to be a guy.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.638
We know who she is. Who she is.
Why is she interested in us?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.359
Because she wants to play him.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.273
Oh, man!

10:55.840 --> 10:57.797
I know this may not be the ideal choice,

10:57.880 --> 10:59.633
but let me tell you something,
if she gets attached,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.992
other stars hear about it
and they start sniffing around,

11:03.080 --> 11:05.072
and next thing you know, Mark Wahlberg.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.117
- Dirk Diggler. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.920
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is she playing him as a girl,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.514
or as a girl playing a guy?

11:13.280 --> 11:16.318
If Hilary Swank gets on board,
this movie gets made.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.160
- Which means you guys get paid.
- Yeah, how much?

11:19.280 --> 11:21.636
Well, if we get a major star
and I'm just guessing,

11:21.720 --> 11:24.394
so don't hold me to it,
maybe 100 grand each.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.711
Fuck you. We could make that much?

11:26.840 --> 11:30.231
Means I got a lot of work getting it made,
and then everybody get paid,

11:30.360 --> 11:32.238
but a lot of things got to happen.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.079
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Boys!

11:34.160 --> 11:35.719
Hundred grand's a lot of money.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.672
Sensible ideas on how to spend it?

11:38.520 --> 11:41.877
I don't know. Probably help pay down
my sister's medical bills.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.189
Oh, yeah. Word up, yo.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.192
That's true. Family comes first, man.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.715
Like I told my moms,
I'm gonna buy her a new car.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.598
- Fuck family.
- Yeah.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.195
I'm getting myself
a top-of-the-line Sauer 202,

11:52.280 --> 11:53.919
couple of vintage fly rods,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.311
spend the next three years up in Montana
just huntin' and fishin'.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.159
Hey, what the fuck, Sykes!

12:00.280 --> 12:02.636
- Get him down now.
- Sit down, boy! Park that...

12:04.400 --> 12:06.551
Hey, hey, hey, everything okay back there?

12:06.640 --> 12:07.869
- It's all good, man.
- Yeah.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.838
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, Josh. Nice hair.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.071
Yeah, man, you're looking
all spiffy and crewed up.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.355
Who's your stylist, Papi?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.716
Hey, Josh, what can you tell us
about the halftime, bro?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.917
Yeah, when can I get
my lap dance from Beyoncé?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.434
- Sykes, shut!
- Hey, Josh,

12:19.520 --> 12:22.160
- do you know Norm, like, personally?
- You're full of shit, yo.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.357
For God's sake. I'm just trying to find out,

12:24.480 --> 12:26.312
Josh, what's expected of us, bro.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.073
Okay, well, there's no details yet,

12:28.160 --> 12:31.710
but knowing Mr. Oglesby,
it's sure to be a real extravaganza.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.913
Does this Hummer come with Advil?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.753
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry. But...

12:35.840 --> 12:38.196
But I'll be sure you get some
when we arrive, okay?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.954
A musical? Are you shittin' me? Larry...

12:43.000 --> 12:44.992
Billy, what if you don't go back?

12:45.960 --> 12:48.600
There are a ton of ways
you could get shipped home.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.558
Or at least out of active duty.

12:50.840 --> 12:54.390
I mean, you're a decorated hero, Billy.
You've done your part.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.477
...about more than just blowing shit up.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.916
Larry, Larry, my boys ship out in two days,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.356
and access becomes
extremely problematic after that,

13:01.440 --> 13:04.000
unless your lawyers
want to parachute into a war zone.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.790
Well, come on, let's get this shit done.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.559
Sarge, you want to stop here?

13:52.440 --> 13:53.556
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:02.920 --> 14:03.910
Good.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.998
Let me guess. Just fell off a truck?

14:33.720 --> 14:35.757
Says a boy brought it,
but doesn't know from where.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.390
Mister! Mister!

14:45.880 --> 14:47.712
Hello, my friend. You want big movie?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.075
Which one you got here?

14:49.200 --> 14:50.759
You want big movie? Mister!

14:50.840 --> 14:51.876
Mister! Hello!

14:51.960 --> 14:53.679
Hey, Crack, they got Finding Nemo.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.274
- I love this shit.
- Finding Nemo.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.874
- How much?
- Sykes!

14:58.480 --> 15:00.392
Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?

15:00.520 --> 15:02.716
No, Sarge, it's for... It's for my daughter.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.117
Life during wartime.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.913
Okay, guys, these are your seats right here.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.357
Got you the best row in the house.
This is Mr. Oglesby's reserved section.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.676
Make yourself at home.
You need anything, you let me know.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.479
I think... I think she likes you.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.711
- Don't you fucking lie to me.
- Hey. Stand down now,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.679
or I'll have both of you
running laps around the stadium.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.437
- Excuse me.
- Look at all these people.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.434
What do you think they're thinking about?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.273
Heavy stuff.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.394
God. Philosophy.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.633
The meaning of life.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.593
There it is.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.118
You look good.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.112
You are a shit liar.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.034
Thank you.

16:13.320 --> 16:17.314
Hey, the doctor said, and I'm quoting here,

16:17.400 --> 16:19.437
my face is 87% healed.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.153
And check it out.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.076
It's two more operations,
and that is goodbye, Miss Frankenstein.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.233
How about you?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.160
You gettin' any?

16:33.560 --> 16:34.994
None of your business.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.597
Yeah, well, that's a big fat no.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.990
So you've killed for your country
and you're still a virgin.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.640
- If that's not a sign of how fucked...
- So, how are things here?

16:43.720 --> 16:45.234
Don't change the subject.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.876
You better be out there gettin' some, boy.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.599
Are you?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.475
Guess.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.115
Some nights I'm like,

16:55.240 --> 16:58.597
whatever, maybe I'll just go
cruise the high school boys

16:58.680 --> 17:01.115
and be like,
"Hey, bubba, take a ride with me.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.680
"Once you've had a girl
with a scar on her face..."

17:02.760 --> 17:04.398
So, how are things here?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.479
I worry about you.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.159
I can't stop worrying about you.
I feel so responsible.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.030
I'm all right.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.999
Your bad.
Thanks for getting me in this shit, Kat.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.597
You know what I mean.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.200
Billy, what the fuck are you doing?

17:28.280 --> 17:29.873
Let's see what this bad boy can do.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.475
I'm not getting an Article 15 because of you.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.835
If they let us Texans all drive,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.480
there'd be no need
for PT belts and safety briefs.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.438
Just 'cause you were conceived in a truck

17:38.520 --> 17:40.477
- doesn't mean you got to die in one.
- Watch this.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.597
- Oh, shit.
- It could save your life someday.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.435
Fuck! Stop!

17:45.200 --> 17:46.793
Oh, shit!

17:47.160 --> 17:49.550
Private Lynn, you are one delinquent punk!

17:50.480 --> 17:52.073
No excuse, Sergeant.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.392
That is correct, Private Lynn.
There is no excuse for your existence.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.678
You got a long, glorious history
of being a shit-bag, don't you?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.038
We heard all about your
criminal butt-fuckery in Texas.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.310
But, Billy, you're no longer in Texas.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.754
So speak up!

18:07.520 --> 18:09.079
Sergeant Breem, Sergeant Dime,

18:09.160 --> 18:12.073
I'm just bustin' my ass tryin'
to be a credit to my platoon.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.592
What in the world led you to believe
you could join the infantry?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.876
You know, the Army needs flute players, too.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.232
I want to defend my homeland, Sergeant.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.879
Bullshit. Keep running.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.194
Hunt down terrorists.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.476
Well, let us know when you find them.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.479
Bring democracy to Iraq.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.234
Lynn, your stupidity
is robbing this world of oxygen,

18:32.320 --> 18:33.720
and I won't stand for it!

18:34.320 --> 18:35.800
Get to the pull-up bars.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.631
Private, did I say recover?

18:44.280 --> 18:46.192
I did it for my sister.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.472
Okay, drop.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.474
Your sister?

18:53.920 --> 18:55.479
Continue, Private Lynn.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.758
My sister Kathryn,

18:57.840 --> 19:00.833
sophomore year at college,
was driving home from work.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.800
Heavy rain.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.919
Big Mercedes goes into a spin,
broadsides her.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.390
Car's totaled.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.756
Fractured leg, pelvis.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.632
A hundred and seventy stitches
below the neck, 63 above.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.791
- Kat was this angel.
- You're creeping me out, Lynn.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.156
I know how you Texas boys are
about your sisters.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.754
Stay on point, Private.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.551
My sister came this close to death.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.117
And then her pussy-boy fiancé dumps her?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.239
In the hospital?

19:31.800 --> 19:33.314
And what did you do?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.312
I sort of went and fucked up his car.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.120
Seems like Private Lynn
has an issue with vehicles.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.474
What kind of car?

19:45.960 --> 19:48.919
Brand-new Saab convertible
with graphite alloy rims.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.317
And I chased after him with a tire iron.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.838
Just... I just wanted to see him run.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.994
My dad...

19:59.080 --> 20:01.470
My dad was able to get him
to drop the charges

20:01.560 --> 20:04.029
if I went to the recruiter's
office the next day.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.272
No regrets, Sergeant.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.191
Hey, y'all. Look! It's you!

20:12.640 --> 20:14.040
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:14.120 --> 20:18.399
America's sport proudly honors
America's heroes.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.475
- Welcome, heroes of Al-Ansakar Canal.
- Beyoncé!

20:21.560 --> 20:22.960
Put a lid on it, Sykes.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.391
Staff Sergeant David Dime,

20:25.480 --> 20:27.756
Sergeant Antonio Holliday,

20:27.880 --> 20:29.951
Specialist William Lynn,

20:30.320 --> 20:32.960
Specialist Marcellino Montoya,

20:33.080 --> 20:35.720
Specialist Theodore Yang,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.920
Specialist Robert Earl Koch,

20:39.320 --> 20:41.630
Private Lodis Beckwith

20:41.760 --> 20:43.831
and Private Kenneth Sykes.

20:52.680 --> 20:54.273
USA!

20:58.760 --> 21:00.877
If you suffer from erectile dysfunction,

21:00.960 --> 21:02.758
it could be due to inadequate blood flow...

21:02.840 --> 21:04.354
Figures.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.070
Sergeant, request permission
to switch seats.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.429
Permission denied, Specialist Lynn.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.910
You will take it for the team.
Move out and draw fire.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.599
Roger that.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.509
Hi. I saw you on the TV.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.311
It was just like a movie.
I was just so proud.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.437
You guys are the best.
I'm right there with you.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.432
No. Not with you in Iraq, but...

21:22.520 --> 21:24.989
My cousin's girlfriend's brother
is also serving in Iraq.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.400
You remind of my dear late husband, Fred.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.675
I wear a uniform, too, but...

21:27.760 --> 21:29.240
I must have watched your video, like...

21:29.320 --> 21:30.436
Then we could drop a big one on Fallujah.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.590
But you boys, you're the real thing.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.672
- ...your supreme sacrifice.
- ...keep you in my heart.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.479
Just like it says in the 89th Psalm.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.029
...gettin' 72 virgins in Heaven. Why 72?

21:38.440 --> 21:39.430
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.749
- Good job.
- Good job.

21:40.840 --> 21:41.876
Very cool.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.269
Josh, man, I'm starving right now.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.953
Can we please stop and get a slice of pizza,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.918
- a hot dog, something?
- I'm sorry, man, we just...

21:50.000 --> 21:52.356
We have to head to the end zone
now for the video shoot.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.636
- What video shoot?
- They didn't tell you guys?

21:54.720 --> 21:56.996
You're gonna be starring
in the official team greeting.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.673
- Go America!
- Wait, what about...

21:58.760 --> 22:00.194
What about halftime, Josh?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.272
I am still waiting on intel from HQ.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.393
"Intel"? "HQ"?
That's, like, G.I. Joe talk, Josh.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.473
Hey, but seriously, Josh,
you're gonna look out for us, right?

22:08.560 --> 22:10.756
We don't want to look like
a bunch of morons on TV. Understand?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.069
- Of course.
- You are a soldier, Mango.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.276
Just be prepared.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.317
Yeah, but prepared for what,
is what I'm trying to find out.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.234
For whatever. Have you not learned this yet
from being in Iraq?

22:18.320 --> 22:21.677
You see, in Iraq, people just try to kill you,
not make you look like a douche bag.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.638
Oh, shit. Don't worry about that, bro.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.638
You'll always be a douche bag in my book.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.592
Okay, okay, guys, it's gonna be fine.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.275
But sorry, one second.
Where's Major McLaurin?

22:30.520 --> 22:31.715
Shit.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.510
Lodis, Sykes, go find Major Mac.
Bring him to the end zone.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.750
- Yes, Sarge.
- Josh?

22:35.840 --> 22:38.480
- Advil?
- Oh, shit, shit. Sorry.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.592
I'm sorry. Sorry. Yes, yes.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.911
I will definitely get that
for you right away.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.919
Okay. Okay, so you guys
can just wait right here,

22:46.040 --> 22:48.157
and I will go tell them that we're ready.

22:50.040 --> 22:53.511
- Wait, there's Major Mac.
- Wonders never cease.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.596
So, so let's get this straight.
You say you want the shooting,

23:01.680 --> 23:04.639
you want stuff blowing up,
but no swearing and no smoking?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.152
That guy ever come up for air?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.475
It's cool, man.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.518
- Man's closing our deal.
- Better be.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.190
My mom's gonna be pissed
if I don't get her that car, man.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.317
Hey, Billy. Go long.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.079
You got it!

23:25.720 --> 23:27.791
Specialist Lynn comes through in the clutch!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.596
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Steven.
That's Steven. I gotta call you back.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.154
It's Steven. He's calling. Okay, bye.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.991
- Hey! Let's go! Let's go!
- Ready, aim, fire!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.957
- Play football, Albert?
- I play a little bit.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.919
- Get off me!
- Get the hell off my field!

23:46.560 --> 23:48.836
Get off now! Get off!

23:48.920 --> 23:51.435
- Mango, Mango, Mango!
- Hey, you! Get off!

23:51.520 --> 23:53.432
I think we need to get off the field.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.193
- Go! Go!
- Let 'em play!

23:55.480 --> 23:57.836
- Get off! Get off!
- Dude!

23:57.960 --> 24:01.670
Off! Let go of that ball! Get off the field!
Get off...

24:01.760 --> 24:03.831
- Put him down!
- I'm taking this Viet Cong off your...

24:03.960 --> 24:05.110
You boys better watch out.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.317
That gentleman's pretty touchy
about his field.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.359
Hey, game's over, boys. Come on, rally up.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.794
Let's go, guys, let's go.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.515
Hey, the man don't care
about our sacrifices, sir.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.910
Keeping his ass safe from WMDs and stuff.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.790
Well, to be fair, he does do a good job
keeping up the grounds.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.115
Hey, Mango.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.511
Doesn't all that green make you
just want to crank up that lawnmower

24:24.600 --> 24:26.717
- and have a go at it?
- It's AstroTurf, you moron.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.359
At ease, at ease, at ease.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.433
My apologies, sir.
That's just how we talk amongst ourselves.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.557
I can appreciate good trash talk.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.355
It's not the best I've heard,
but still pretty good.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.318
- Why, thank you, sir.
- All I'm saying is,

24:38.400 --> 24:39.800
any beaner would love a...

24:40.720 --> 24:43.155
- Hey, show some respect.
- Lock it up. Mango, come on.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.435
Eyes front, y'all.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.910
High-value target, 11 o'clock,
20 meters. Goddamn!

24:47.000 --> 24:47.990
Excuse me.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.912
- I see Mrs. Mango right there.
- Doesn't miss a thing, does he?

24:50.080 --> 24:52.231
- Come on.
- Hey.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.359
- On the whistle.
- Let's go.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.639
Bad news?

25:01.240 --> 25:03.755
No, sir. Are you...

25:03.920 --> 25:07.470
That's right. And you must be
Specialist William Lynn, right?

25:08.240 --> 25:11.278
Specialist Lynn,
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

25:11.360 --> 25:13.591
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- The honor's mine.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.637
You're part of a famous tradition now.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.638
Audie Murphy? You heard of him?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.836
Heroes of the Alamo.
I know you heard of them.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.435
Everybody knows Texans
make the best fighters.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.398
I never thought of it that way, sir.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.437
And modest, too. I like that.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.155
- You're from Stovall, correct?
- Yes, sir, I am.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.074
I know it. Grew up near Sweetwater myself.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.920
Started my first real estate company
in the area.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.789
Excuse me, Mr. Oglesby.
Everything's ready for the videotaping, sir.

25:50.960 --> 25:53.634
Okay, now hold your balls up like this.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.110
- Big smiles, girls!
- Everyone ready?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.520
And action.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.391
Bravo Squad would like to wish
you and your families

26:01.480 --> 26:02.800
a very happy Thanksgiving.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.351
And to our brother and sister
soldiers in the field,

26:05.480 --> 26:06.630
Hajji don't surf!

26:07.160 --> 26:08.674
Cut! That was not in the...

26:08.840 --> 26:11.753
Bravo Squad would like
to wish you and your family...

26:11.880 --> 26:13.155
Cut! People, we...

26:13.520 --> 26:15.637
Bravo Squad would like
to wish you and your family

26:15.760 --> 26:17.877
a very happy Thanksgiving.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.395
Go team!

26:19.480 --> 26:21.073
Dallas sucks horse cock!

26:21.160 --> 26:22.833
- Boo!
- You suck!

26:23.840 --> 26:27.038
American soldiers strong and true,

26:27.480 --> 26:30.552
the best in the world at what they do.

26:30.960 --> 26:34.032
Thanks for keeping us safe and strong...

26:34.120 --> 26:35.110
Come on, Bravo.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.351
...against all those who would do us harm.

26:37.960 --> 26:42.159
Bravo, USA! Bravo, USA!

26:44.360 --> 26:45.874
USA!

26:50.920 --> 26:54.630
Now, if you want to talk about a group
that knows how to suit up and show up,

26:54.720 --> 26:55.949
well, here they are.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.312
The best our nation has to offer.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.355
I have to say, I have never...

27:06.080 --> 27:09.118
I have never been prouder to be an American

27:09.200 --> 27:11.556
than when I saw that footage
of Bravo in action.

27:13.920 --> 27:16.799
Now, it's my personal feeling
that the War on Terror

27:16.920 --> 27:18.593
may be just about as pure a fight

27:18.680 --> 27:21.320
between good and evil
as we're likely to ever see.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.236
And would the world be a better place
with Saddam Hussein in power?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.919
I bet a grateful Mr. and Mrs.
Mohammed Q Public in Baghdad

27:29.040 --> 27:32.556
would have a thing or two
to tell the naysayers about that.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.750
Now, I was visiting
with the President recently,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.232
and he assured me we are winning this war,
make no mistake.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.197
As long as we keep our eye on the ball,
we shall prevail.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.236
- Sir.
- Welcome to Texas.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.679
So, what are your feelings
as you look forward to the halftime show?

27:49.760 --> 27:51.911
We weren't issued feelings, sir.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.199
My men are ready for anything.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.237
Just don't ask us to dance,
and we'll be all right.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.195
Ma'am.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.791
Any trouble sleeping or readjusting
to life back home?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.835
No, ma'am.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.195
I sleep fine.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.634
Yeah, I'm good.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.949
Sir in the back.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.913
What was your hardest mission?

28:15.040 --> 28:16.918
When we lost Sergeant Breem.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.556
Are we making a difference over there?

28:21.960 --> 28:23.679
Absolutely, sir. America's out there

28:23.760 --> 28:26.912
producing dozens of suicidally
pissed-off insurgents every day.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.276
Are we making a difference over there?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.399
I think we are, yes.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.798
We are making a difference, definitely.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.479
What do you do during your downtime?
For fun.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.149
Masturbate.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.710
- Masturbate.
- Masturbate, just all over the place.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.634
What do you do during your downtime?
For fun.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.795
Most days we're putting in 12 to 14 hours.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.351
When we get a little
kick-back time, though...

28:58.440 --> 28:59.669
Guys?

29:00.560 --> 29:02.392
I like to lift weights.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.359
I play video games.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.520
I have a plethora of board games.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.831
Yeah, my... My baby girl sent us her copy
of Chutes and Ladders.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.600
Keeps us battle-ready.

29:18.120 --> 29:22.592
"I like to kill my enemies and listen
to the lamentation of their women."

29:29.200 --> 29:33.035
That's from Conan the Barbarian.
I just always wanted to say that.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.040
Sir in the back.

29:39.320 --> 29:44.952
So, what inspired Bravo to do
what it did that fateful day at AI-Ansakar?

29:48.960 --> 29:52.158
Specialist Lynn was the first to recognize
what was going on down there.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.197
He was also the first one to react.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.792
I think he's the appropriate one
to answer your question.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.032
To tell you the honest truth, sir,
I don't remember all that much.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.598
I saw Shroom, Sergeant Breem,
being dragged away,

30:09.680 --> 30:11.911
so I wanted to get him back.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.633
And I guess my training just kicked in.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.632
According to your Silver Star citation,

30:16.720 --> 30:18.916
you were in hand-to-hand combat
with one of the insurgents.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.229
Is that right?

30:21.520 --> 30:24.479
I mostly returned fire
and rendered aid to Sergeant Breem.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.756
Yeah, but you also got
to engage the enemy up close.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.958
I mean, not many soldiers
are given that kind of experience.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.118
"Given"? I mean,
it's not what I wanted to do.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.357
The... The guy just jumped me, and we...

30:36.720 --> 30:39.474
- What was it like?
- What was what like, sir?

30:39.800 --> 30:42.235
Well, to be so close to the enemy.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.554
It wasn't like we had that much time
to get acquainted.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.356
Look, it all happened
real fast, okay? I just...

30:55.240 --> 30:58.039
It's not something I'm real proud of, but...

30:58.760 --> 31:00.911
You know, I did what I had to do.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.512
USA!

31:10.680 --> 31:13.275
Yeah, the Hindus were onto something, Billy.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.276
Ours is what they called
"the karma of action."

31:18.720 --> 31:20.359
The way of the warrior.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.712
Sorry fucking excuse for a warrior
I'm turning out to be.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.715
Only if you keep asking why.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.113
Like, "Why must I always
take point on patrol?"

31:30.520 --> 31:32.477
Or, "Why must I kill?"

31:33.360 --> 31:37.149
Always wanting answers?
That's just desire, bro.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.679
And that shit'll trap you inside of yourself.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.434
And believe me, you don't want to be there,
especially when you're out here.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.319
Yeah. Well, what if I desire
not to get killed?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.837
Well, it's useless to worry about it.

31:48.640 --> 31:52.190
If a bullet's gonna get you,
it's already been fired.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.073
Don't worry.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.638
Any suggestions?

31:58.160 --> 32:02.439
"Always perform with detachment
any action you must do.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.830
"And surrender all actions to me."

32:05.160 --> 32:08.039
This is what Krishna tells the warrior Arjuna

32:08.160 --> 32:10.994
when he's hesitating the night
before the great battle.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.192
Krishna. That's the dude
with the blue skin, right?

32:16.120 --> 32:19.477
An avatar of Vishnu, the supreme deity.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.837
Not in my part of Texas.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.719
Look, Billy,

32:27.480 --> 32:30.200
it doesn't have to be about God or country.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.516
Just find something bigger than yourself.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.040
Some actually prefer to believe
they're already dead.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.795
Bob, I'm glad you asked me that question,

32:59.880 --> 33:03.874
because it gives me the opportunity
to clear up a few misconceptions.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.640
Shit.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.230
You okay?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.080
Yeah.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.033
I'm just a little beat.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.157
Sounds like it's been a long tour.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.432
- Iraq or America?
- I guess both.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.759
I'm Faison.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.958
- Say again?
- Faison.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.356
F-A-I-S-O-N.

33:34.920 --> 33:37.674
And I know who you are,
Billy Lynn from Stovall.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.880
My great-grandmother
was Miss Stovall, 1937.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.189
How 'bout that?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.954
Everyone said she had a shot
at winning Miss Texas that year.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.992
Really? And how'd she do?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.190
Second runner-up.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.476
Everybody said she should've won,
but the fix was in.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.358
You know how those pageant deals work.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.159
Yeah, I do.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.794
Actually, no, I don't.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.671
I have no idea how
those pageant deals work.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.236
I don't know much about anything, really.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.839
Could have fooled me.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.197
I've gotten kind of used to telling people
stuff they want to hear.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.637
No. You put it right out there.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.309
And that's strong. I mean...

34:13.159 --> 34:15.469
Grappling with the enemy up close like that.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.559
Your friend's death.
You were right there with him.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.472
Can't be easy talking to a roomful
of strangers about those things.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.995
It is sort of weird being honored
for the worst day of your life.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.033
It's like...

34:32.440 --> 34:33.715
Never mind.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.152
So, what's it like being a cheerleader?

34:39.360 --> 34:41.079
You really want to know?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.953
Yeah. I really do.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.870
Really.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.277
Well, it's great.

34:47.360 --> 34:50.592
I mean, people see us on TV,

34:51.000 --> 34:53.389
and they think that's all there is to it.

34:53.480 --> 34:57.076
You know, dancing and having fun,

34:57.600 --> 35:01.276
but community service
is actually the main part of our job.

35:01.400 --> 35:05.030
Visiting hospitals,
working with underprivileged kids,

35:05.200 --> 35:07.192
stuff like that, you know?

35:07.400 --> 35:10.677
To me, that's been the most satisfying thing
about being a cheerleader,

35:11.200 --> 35:14.352
serving others. The spiritual aspect of it.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.310
Billy,

35:18.320 --> 35:21.279
are you a Christian?

35:25.120 --> 35:27.157
I'm searching.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.034
Do you pray?

35:30.560 --> 35:32.711
Not as much as I should.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.517
I never got much from going to church,

35:35.600 --> 35:38.240
but then in Iraq,
in the middle of all this shooting,

35:38.400 --> 35:42.235
my friend Shroom, Sergeant Breem, gets hit.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.434
He's just, you know,

35:46.400 --> 35:48.995
lying there, bleeding out.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.395
And when I go to him, suddenly,
for the first time in my life,

35:53.560 --> 35:56.473
I feel close to something...

35:58.800 --> 36:03.352
I don't know, bigger than myself.

36:04.680 --> 36:08.993
And when Shroom died,
I felt something passing through me,

36:09.280 --> 36:10.714
like...

36:12.600 --> 36:15.069
Like his soul or...

36:16.600 --> 36:18.034
I don't know.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.076
Billy.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.236
Most of the time, that's how it works.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.958
Life gets so dark,
and we think all the light's gone out of us,

36:27.920 --> 36:29.673
but it's always there.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.558
If we just open the door a crack,
the light comes pouring in.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.755
You know how we kept looking at each...

36:38.400 --> 36:40.790
I think God wanted us to meet today.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.554
We are all called to be his lights
out in the world.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.599
And I truly believe that we...

36:51.960 --> 36:54.111
Look, if you couldn't deliver,
why'd you tell the guys that number?

36:54.200 --> 36:56.556
Now they think they're coming home
to Jacuzzis and shit.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.199
I told them a lot of things have to happen.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.516
It's Thanksgiving in LA.
I just need more time to deliver.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.319
- Yeah, we don't have time, Albert.
- I... I know.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.711
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.951
Why do you look like you just got laid?

37:09.720 --> 37:12.554
Gather round, boys.
Here's a little gift for you from the team.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.630
Answers.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.791
- Thank you.
- Now, these are actual game balls.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.352
But they'll look better with a little
ink on 'em, don't you think?

37:19.640 --> 37:21.632
Hooah. Thank you.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.433
There you go.

37:24.360 --> 37:25.760
Thank you, sir.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.478
- Thanks.
- No problem.

37:29.640 --> 37:30.869
Hey, listen.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.317
What you carry out there?

37:33.520 --> 37:37.719
Most of the time my weapon's the M4,
standard semi-automatic assault rifle.

37:37.840 --> 37:41.754
A few times I've been on the.50,
what we carry on top of our Humvees.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.669
That's a heavy machine gun,
lays down 550 rounds a minute.

37:46.520 --> 37:49.240
Incendiary rounds
that could punch through an inch of steel.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.789
The M4.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.319
I mean, what does it do
when it... When it hits somebody?

37:56.200 --> 37:58.396
- Fucks 'em up.
- But does it kill them?

37:59.160 --> 38:01.629
I mean, stopping power's what I'm getting at.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.796
Maybe not with a body shot.
That's why we aim for the face.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.078
The.50, I read about that sucker
in Guns & Ammo.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.199
Been in every single war since the 1920s.
What's that one like?

38:14.000 --> 38:18.517
Well, you hit someone with a.50,
it takes 'em apart like...

38:19.480 --> 38:20.960
Like a pink mist.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.634
You ever kill somebody?

38:23.720 --> 38:25.996
I mean, like...

38:26.720 --> 38:28.279
Watch 'em die?

38:28.720 --> 38:29.870
Yes.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.758
What's that feel like?

38:32.400 --> 38:35.552
It doesn't feel like anything.
Not while it's happening.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.552
Come on, man.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.552
- You can tell us.
- Come on.

38:42.560 --> 38:47.351
What's it feel like when you hit somebody?
Like, really connect.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.519
Look at the crap they use
to protect themselves.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.671
- Do you guys have half this shit?
- Nope.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.434
Grab an equipment bag
and you can take some back.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.510
Do it.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.353
Hey, Billy, find where
they're keeping the steroids?

39:07.080 --> 39:08.275
Roy.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.956
You remember my wife, Nikki. Tiffany.
Excuse me.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.392
Hello. Thrilled you could come.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.069
Come on in.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.629
Thank you.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.398
Now, normally, I like to give
thanks to God before kickoff

39:29.480 --> 39:31.711
for the blessings we've received...

39:32.200 --> 39:33.839
And the games we've won.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.478
But this Thanksgiving,
I want to honor my special guests.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.990
A group of soldiers called Bravo.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.760
Their presence here serves as a reminder

39:45.840 --> 39:47.718
that we must not only give thanks
for our bounty,

39:47.960 --> 39:49.952
but we must also defend it.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.793
And in times of grave threat,
mount an aggressive offense

39:55.360 --> 39:59.240
if America is to hang on to that trophy
of being the greatest nation on Earth.

40:00.600 --> 40:02.000
Door left, door right!

40:02.320 --> 40:04.357
- Got door right.
- Sykes! Foo, get them up!

40:04.480 --> 40:06.312
Get up! Get up! Get the fuck up!

40:06.480 --> 40:08.039
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

40:08.800 --> 40:10.314
Don't fuckin' move!

40:10.440 --> 40:12.511
Don't fuckin' move! You stay right there.

40:12.680 --> 40:13.670
- Okay.
- You stay!

40:13.920 --> 40:15.991
- Foo, check the back.
- Got it.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.997
- All clear.
- Room clear.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.152
- Check that kitchen.
- Do you have any weapons?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.519
No. He doesn't have anything.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.593
He says to tell you there's nothing here.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.990
Are you working
with the anti-coalition forces?

40:32.800 --> 40:36.350
This is ridiculous. He is a simple man.
He's taking care of his family.

40:36.880 --> 40:37.916
He is not the enemy.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.515
Are you hiding anyone or anything?

40:42.640 --> 40:44.677
- That's crazy. He's not...
- Look at this shit.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.833
Come on. You just said you had no weapons.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.874
It is a personal gun.
For personal use to defend his family.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.679
There's no government, no law.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.872
You think I'm going to fight
the Americans with a pistol?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.032
- Hey.
- And these papers?

41:04.720 --> 41:05.949
He was a colonel in the military.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.032
These are his personal things, his memories.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.838
We got more houses to get to, Sergeant.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.760
What's he saying?

41:17.760 --> 41:18.830
Interpret!

41:18.960 --> 41:20.440
Sorry, he's upset. He's not...

41:20.560 --> 41:22.916
Hey, hey, hey, Sergeant, check this out.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.315
Enough! Enough!

41:37.760 --> 41:39.319
Zip them up and put them in the truck!

41:40.600 --> 41:42.239
Do you not fear me?

41:42.320 --> 41:44.152
I'm fuckin' serious... Get the fuck off!

41:44.240 --> 41:47.392
Easy. Easy, man. Easy.

41:48.760 --> 41:49.750
Go easy.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.000
He says he knows once you take him
he's not coming back.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.239
Tell them we're just going
to verify their identities.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.595
Then they'll be brought back to their family.

42:33.800 --> 42:36.315
So let's give 'em
a big-as-all-hell Texas welcome.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.514
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

42:50.280 --> 42:52.237
- Hey, what'll you have?
- How about an OJ?

42:52.320 --> 42:53.470
Cool.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.835
Thanks a lot, Joe.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.678
- My man.
- Hell, yeah.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.316
Hey, it's all coming together.
Just taking a little time.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.512
Now, how you gonna finance this film?

43:11.600 --> 43:13.557
We have a lot of interest in Hollywood.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.359
That's a problem, Albert.

43:15.480 --> 43:20.032
The way I see it, Bravo's here,
and Hollywood is way the heck over there.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.354
And frankly, I don't think these studio folks

43:22.440 --> 43:25.717
have the moral fortitude
to grasp the true stakes of Bravo's story.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.440
You have a point there, Norm.
You have a point.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.951
What do you mean you don't disagree?
If you agree, then buy the thing.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.235
If you disagree, then don't.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.198
Because when you're telling me
you don't disagree,

43:35.360 --> 43:37.511
what I hear is you don't have
an opinion whatsoever.

43:38.520 --> 43:41.115
Sorry, ma'am. Just keep your hands
and feet away from their mouths

43:41.200 --> 43:42.680
and you won't get hurt.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.716
That's what I'm saying,
and you keep saying the same thing.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.393
I mean, give me...

43:48.520 --> 43:50.000
So, Billy, tell us about everything.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.753
Dad, would you turn that shit off?

43:52.280 --> 43:53.316
It's loud in here.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.794
He doesn't need to be hearing
all this propaganda...

43:54.880 --> 43:55.996
Kathryn.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.560
They could cripple the economy,

43:57.720 --> 44:00.838
force widespread quarantines,
and cause sickness and death.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.594
So, how's it going?

44:05.320 --> 44:06.959
It's weird.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.796
I mean, we got rid of their dictator,

44:09.920 --> 44:12.560
and now they're fighting each other
as well as us.

44:12.720 --> 44:16.430
We're getting 'em sewer systems
and building schools,

44:16.560 --> 44:18.233
and they don't even have textbooks.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.035
We're soldiers.
What do we know about stuff like that?

44:21.760 --> 44:23.956
I'm sure y'all are doing the best you can.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.149
Yeah, with an illegal war

44:26.240 --> 44:28.436
that we should've never started
in the first place.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.639
What about all those WMDs
we keep hearing about?

44:32.760 --> 44:34.638
You see any?

44:35.160 --> 44:37.720
How about bringing democracy
to the country,

44:37.800 --> 44:40.793
- is that working out...
- Kathryn, no politics at the table.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.759
- We all know what that war is about.
- Yeah, right. The oil?

44:43.880 --> 44:46.031
Like you know everything, Kat.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.397
Like you're better
than all the people in Washington?

44:48.480 --> 44:51.234
Yeah, I think if they want a war so bad,
they should fight it themselves.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.353
It's not worth another American life,
especially not my brother's.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.669
Kathryn.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.877
- Your son.
- That's enough!

44:59.600 --> 45:00.829
What's the matter, Albert?

45:00.920 --> 45:02.195
Don't like cake?

45:02.280 --> 45:03.953
Everybody in LA is eating turkey.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.954
This is the part I hate, waiting around.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.756
Know what I do over there to kill time?

45:09.120 --> 45:10.554
I'm afraid to ask.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.279
I imagine my kid.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.795
Up here. I imagine playing with him, man.
It just levels me up.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.080
What you do over there? What's...
What's your specialty?

45:22.920 --> 45:24.240
Communications.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.596
And I'm telling you, AI, when I get out,

45:26.680 --> 45:29.673
I could be like one of them IT guys
up in some office, man.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.553
You got a skill, man.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.679
I need one of them.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.469
Hello.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.711
How has Norm been treating you fellas?

45:37.880 --> 45:41.191
Excellent, sir.
Stadium cake's just out of this world.

45:41.520 --> 45:46.595
Well, good. I just wanted to come over here
and tell you all how much I appreciate you.

45:46.760 --> 45:51.118
Oh, heck. I bet you boys have had
just about your fill of compliments by now.

45:51.440 --> 45:55.559
No. We thrive on them, sir.
It's the compliments that keep us going.

45:55.680 --> 45:58.718
You know, in the face
of the enemy's fanatical hatred.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.274
A sense of humor is a powerful weapon.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.033
My name is Wayne Pfister.

46:05.120 --> 46:08.875
Pfister Oil & Gas. 100% family-owned.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.597
We are digging deep to find
new sources of energy right here in Texas.

46:13.720 --> 46:18.920
Extracting oil out of the Barnett Shale
with a process called "hydraulic fracturing".

46:19.520 --> 46:23.480
See, some of my friends' kids
are servin' over there with y'all,

46:23.600 --> 46:28.152
so it's a personal thing for me,
lessening our dependence on foreign oil.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.836
I figure the better I do my job,

46:30.960 --> 46:33.839
the quicker we can bring
you youngsters home.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.110
Thank you, sir.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.677
We certainly do appreciate your efforts.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.039
From your own perspective,

46:47.880 --> 46:50.395
how do you think we're doing over there?

46:51.800 --> 46:53.598
How are we doing?

46:55.080 --> 46:57.072
Just from our own perspective?

46:59.800 --> 47:02.918
Well, I'm far from qualified
to speak to the big picture, sir.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.037
All I can tell you with any confidence

47:05.280 --> 47:08.956
is that the exchange of force
with intent to kill...

47:10.920 --> 47:13.833
That is truly a mind-altering
experience, sir.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.756
I can only imagine how hard it is
to face that level of violence.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.240
No.

47:19.600 --> 47:21.193
We like going lethal.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.511
I mean, isn't that
what you're paying us for, sir?

47:23.600 --> 47:26.559
Take the fight to America's enemies
and send them straight to hell?

47:26.680 --> 47:28.831
If we didn't enjoy killing people,
what'd be the point?

47:28.960 --> 47:31.759
Might as well send the Peace Corps in
to fight the war.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.595
Well, I... I guess you got me there.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.989
Sir, you see these men?

47:38.120 --> 47:40.840
I don't know how they were
before the Army got them,

47:40.960 --> 47:43.031
but you give them a weapon system
and a couple Red Bulls

47:43.120 --> 47:44.873
and they'll blast the hell
out of anything that moves.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.952
- Ain't that right, Bravo?
- Yes, Sergeant!

47:47.040 --> 47:48.793
See what I mean, sir? They're killers.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.599
They're having the time of their lives.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.518
So if your company
wants to frack the living shit

47:52.640 --> 47:55.474
out of the Barnett Shale, that's fine,
that's your prerogative,

47:55.600 --> 47:57.080
but don't go doing it on our account.

47:57.160 --> 47:58.958
You got your business, sir, and we got ours.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.999
You just keep on drillin', sir,
and we'll keep on killin'.

48:05.640 --> 48:06.869
Okay.

48:09.280 --> 48:10.714
Okay.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.679
I'm gonna go now.

48:20.080 --> 48:24.120
Yo, Dave, after the Army, man,
you... You really should consider acting.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.913
Dime ain't no act.
He just likes fucking with people.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.639
What do you think acting is, man?

48:30.800 --> 48:34.396
Damn it, Billy, why did I have to
give that nice man such a hard time?

48:34.480 --> 48:36.153
Hard to say, Sergeant.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.511
Maybe I'm just an asshole?

48:41.160 --> 48:42.992
Maybe you are, Sergeant.

48:45.680 --> 48:47.831
Good man, Billy. Stay sharp.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.593
- Hey, Mango.
- Yeah, buddy?

48:54.680 --> 48:56.558
I met somebody at the press conference.

48:56.640 --> 48:59.314
- A cheerleader.
- Don't be an idiot, Billy.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.074
I'm telling you, this girl and I...
We sort of connected.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.560
Actually, we made out.

49:03.640 --> 49:05.950
What? And then you banged her?

49:06.040 --> 49:07.315
Man, this is serious.

49:07.400 --> 49:10.074
I want to see her again,
get to know her better.

49:10.160 --> 49:11.958
I hate to tell you this, Billy,
but you got to go for it

49:12.040 --> 49:13.156
- right now, bro.
- Thanks for your service.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.118
Thank you. 'Cause by the time we get back,

49:15.200 --> 49:17.635
she's gonna be fucking
this big-ass linebacker.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.189
Buddy, she's gonna be like,
"Ay! Ay! Billy who? Ay!"

49:20.280 --> 49:22.556
- Fuck you, asshole.
- I'm just saying,

49:22.640 --> 49:24.438
give her a call, man.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.636
You... You don't have her number, do you?

49:27.720 --> 49:29.677
Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.

49:29.760 --> 49:31.433
Hey, what's up, vato?

49:31.520 --> 49:33.398
Yeah, what's up, vato?

49:33.480 --> 49:35.312
- Chillin', chillin'.
- Yeah. My friend Billy here

49:35.400 --> 49:37.790
is feeling a little stress, you know?
Girl troubles.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.634
Hey, Billy. I'm Hector.
I got just the thing for that.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.440
- Let's go outside.
- All right.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.959
What is this place?

49:52.280 --> 49:54.875
Nowhere, man.
One of them place that don't exist.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.917
Good for smoke breaks.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.913
You think we should?

50:00.400 --> 50:02.517
The hell are they gonna do, Billy,

50:02.600 --> 50:04.159
send us to Iraq?

50:08.920 --> 50:11.071
What's that all about?

50:11.160 --> 50:13.720
- Norm's fancy-ass new stadium.
- It's huge.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.871
This team hasn't made
the playoffs in, like, years.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.952
- They suck.
- Doesn't matter.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.760
Some folks pay tens of thousands of dollars.

50:20.840 --> 50:24.231
- For seats?
- Just to reserve the right to buy seats.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.993
Jesus.

50:26.480 --> 50:29.234
Rich people. I don't get 'em.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.199
They don't get you, either, Billy.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.000
Well... Thanks for sharing, my bro.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.560
Appreciate it.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.831
Hey, got to support the troops.

50:40.920 --> 50:42.036
Hooah.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.312
You know, I'm thinking of signing up.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.199
- For real?
- Yeah.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.397
Well, I've got a kid and her mom,

50:49.480 --> 50:51.437
and I want to take care of them and all,

50:51.520 --> 50:54.991
but the way it is now,
it just isn't working out.

50:55.080 --> 50:57.720
Once I'm in the Army,
won't have to worry about insurance.

50:57.800 --> 51:01.589
Plus, they're offering
an enlistment bonus. Six thousand dollars.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.194
Six...

51:03.280 --> 51:05.476
They got my brown ass for free, Billy.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.074
They said, "Sign here, Mr. Montoya."

51:07.160 --> 51:09.675
"Yes, of course. Here, take it."

51:09.760 --> 51:11.479
I don't know why we're laughing.

51:11.560 --> 51:14.234
- That pretty much sucks.
- It definitely sucks.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.755
- Yeah?
- Yeah. All those days I was over there,

51:16.840 --> 51:19.674
I just kept thinking,
"I am so done with this shit."

51:19.760 --> 51:22.229
You know? But then I'm like...

51:22.320 --> 51:24.835
Okay, so when my time's up...

51:24.920 --> 51:27.879
What the hell's waiting for me
here gonna be any better?

51:28.120 --> 51:31.511
Like, working at Burger King,
you know? Fuck that.

51:32.120 --> 51:34.919
That's when I remember
why I signed up in the first place, you know?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.912
Exactly.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.754
Yo, what I got out here sucks.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.799
So, I might as well join.

51:42.880 --> 51:46.430
- What else is there?
- What else is there?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.114
What else is there?

51:49.480 --> 51:53.599
Proudly we hailed

51:53.680 --> 51:59.119
At the twilight's last gleaming

51:59.200 --> 52:04.594
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

52:04.680 --> 52:10.039
Through the perilous fight

52:10.120 --> 52:15.639
O'er the ramparts we watched

52:15.720 --> 52:21.591
Were so gallantly streaming

52:21.680 --> 52:26.709
And the rockets' red glare

52:26.840 --> 52:32.677
The bombs bursting in air

52:32.800 --> 52:37.920
Gave proof through the night

52:38.000 --> 52:39.992
That our flag

52:40.080 --> 52:44.438
Was still there

52:44.560 --> 52:48.076
O say does that

52:48.200 --> 52:51.079
Star-spangled

52:51.400 --> 52:53.960
Banner yet

52:54.040 --> 52:56.760
Wave

53:00.840 --> 53:04.470
O'er the land of the

53:04.560 --> 53:07.394
Free

53:10.160 --> 53:14.632
And the home

53:14.720 --> 53:18.316
Of the

53:18.400 --> 53:20.995
Brave

53:24.480 --> 53:26.790
Order arms!

53:31.800 --> 53:35.874
We were flying home
with Shroom's body two weeks ago,

53:35.960 --> 53:39.032
and there were these

53:39.120 --> 53:42.796
civilian contractors
in the front of the plane.

53:42.880 --> 53:47.432
Bunch of chefs back from working
in the Green Zone for the big brass.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.720
These guys made a ton of money in Baghdad,

53:51.800 --> 53:53.996
and they're all celebrating.

53:54.080 --> 53:56.959
Handing us drinks, and...

53:57.040 --> 54:00.238
It's like champagne and cigars.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.833
And then there's Shroom in the back, just...

54:07.280 --> 54:10.637
Just lying there, in...

54:11.120 --> 54:12.839
In his flag-covered box.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.880
You know?

54:21.360 --> 54:23.079
You doing okay?

54:25.320 --> 54:26.834
We're there.

54:28.080 --> 54:31.357
We just try to
get through the day in one piece.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.477
I've been seeing this shrink.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.518
He used to work at the VA hospital,

54:38.600 --> 54:41.877
- seeing a lot of soldiers...
- Kat. I'm fine.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.752
You're "fine"?

54:47.240 --> 54:48.515
How?

54:56.200 --> 54:57.998
Billy, what if you don't go back?

54:58.080 --> 54:59.434
Like I have a choice.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.920
You could.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.960
There are a ton of ways
you could get shipped home.

55:06.040 --> 55:08.316
Or at least out of active duty.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.390
I mean, you're a decorated hero, Billy.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.233
You've done your part.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.439
There's no shame in it.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.079
I've done my research.

55:17.160 --> 55:19.117
- I made a commitment.
- To what?

55:19.200 --> 55:20.998
We both know exactly why you signed up.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.197
Okay, well, I'm going back, Kat.

55:26.840 --> 55:30.072
If anything happens to you,
I'm gonna kill myself.

55:31.120 --> 55:33.510
Now, why would you do a thing like that?

55:33.640 --> 55:35.120
'Cause you're, like,

55:35.200 --> 55:37.317
the last solid thing
we have left in this family.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.390
Come on, look at us.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.314
That's pretty fucked up.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.954
It is fucked up.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.272
What do you say?

55:51.080 --> 55:52.878
I'm going back, Kat.

55:54.120 --> 55:55.793
I have to.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.236
Hit him! Hit him!

56:09.320 --> 56:11.915
Get that motherfucker!
Get that motherfucker!

56:12.000 --> 56:14.435
Go! Go, go, go, go!

56:24.440 --> 56:26.511
- Come on, D!
- Come on!

56:26.600 --> 56:29.195
- Come on, D!
- Come on! Come on!

56:29.320 --> 56:32.233
D-line, you're getting blown back!

56:32.320 --> 56:34.232
Johnson hasn't
filled that gap in two seasons.

56:34.320 --> 56:36.232
Foo, you haven't filled the gap

56:36.320 --> 56:38.039
- in, like, three years.
- Shut up.

56:38.120 --> 56:39.554
Losers, you suck!

56:39.640 --> 56:41.074
Dude, can you show some respect?

56:41.160 --> 56:42.833
I don't see you out there fighting for 'em.

56:42.960 --> 56:45.077
Take a seat, killing machine. You got this.

56:45.160 --> 56:47.994
Hello, Billy? Dr. Paul Schatten here.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.436
Your sister Kathryn asked me...

56:50.520 --> 56:53.240
Man, football is boring.

56:53.320 --> 56:56.392
What are you talking about?
Football kicks every other sports' ass.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.233
There's, like, five seconds
of game play for ten minutes

56:58.320 --> 57:00.516
of standing around checking in
on each other. Hi. How you doin'?

57:00.600 --> 57:01.920
- You good?
- That's 'cause they're planning it out.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.753
Do you know how much thought and effort
goes into this shit?

57:03.840 --> 57:04.910
How much thought...

57:05.000 --> 57:07.356
Hi. We got cut off.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.238
This is Dr. Paul Schatten.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.999
I know you're listening.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.799
Billy, your sister spoke to me.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.439
She's very concerned about you.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.230
I believe there's solid grounds
for taking you out of active duty.

57:18.320 --> 57:21.870
Now, Kathryn will drive you
to the VA hospital right after the game.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.913
And I can put in a request for
a delay in your redeployment

57:25.000 --> 57:27.390
pending an honorable discharge hearing.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.120
I know this isn't an easy decision, Billy,

57:31.200 --> 57:33.237
but there's no dishonor in it.

57:33.320 --> 57:37.200
Many returning soldiers suffer from PTSD
and are not diagnosed.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.554
The more courageous individuals
like you come forward,

57:40.640 --> 57:42.757
the more we can help others.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.513
Billy...

57:44.600 --> 57:47.035
Please, think about it, okay?

57:47.120 --> 57:49.476
Call me if you have any questions.

57:49.840 --> 57:51.718
Goodbye, Billy.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.998
Asian! There are no Asians
or Latinos in football!

57:55.080 --> 57:56.639
Well, just try to watch a little bit.

57:56.720 --> 57:59.315
- Okay, I'll watch. Okay. I'm sorry.
- You might learn a little thing or two.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.312
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be back.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.075
Come on!

58:10.840 --> 58:14.231
And how are you enjoying your time here
in sunny Iraq, Private Lynn?

58:14.640 --> 58:16.996
- That's quite a question.
- And what's your answer?

58:21.840 --> 58:23.354
All right.

58:24.600 --> 58:26.796
This place sucks.

58:26.880 --> 58:28.314
People hate us.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.352
Nothing makes sense.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.999
I'd rather go home.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.514
"Go home"?

58:33.600 --> 58:36.274
Back in Texas, you were pretty much
a wall-to-wall fuck-up.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.433
Yeah, pretty much.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.316
Look, I know this isn't
the most pleasant place

58:45.400 --> 58:47.835
for you to be spending
the flower of your youth,

58:47.960 --> 58:50.191
but I'm beginning to think
you might have an aptitude

58:50.280 --> 58:51.953
for the soldiering business.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.317
I've been watching you, Billy.

58:57.840 --> 59:00.355
When the shit hits the fan,
you're always on point.

59:00.440 --> 59:02.079
And with this bunch of broke dicks,

59:02.160 --> 59:03.833
that's exactly what we need.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.959
You belong here.

59:10.840 --> 59:14.720
You know, Shroom would probably say
some mumbo-jumbo horseshit about karma

59:14.800 --> 59:17.634
and everything happening
as it's been preordained.

59:18.840 --> 59:21.309
So, maybe there's a reason you're here.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.637
Think about it, Billy.

59:37.480 --> 59:40.120
Gentlemen, a little gift from my man Hector.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.714
Okay?

59:45.280 --> 59:47.237
Hide that shit, hide that shit,
hide that shit.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.915
- Hey, shitbirds, move over.
- All right, guys, get up.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.390
- Scoot one over for Albert.
- What's up, man?

59:52.480 --> 59:53.709
What's up? What's up?

59:56.160 --> 59:59.278
All right. So, where's
that big check there, buddy?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.760
What... What check?

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.069
I'm working on it.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.634
- Hey, Albert, man.
- Yo.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.112
You know, we were wondering what's up
with the movie project, man.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.271
Seeing as we're about to head out to Iraq,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.113
to get shot at and all?

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.159
- You got a studio yet, man?
- We do not. And Hilary's out.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.516
But there's still tons of interest out there.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.913
Gonna get a little crazy
Just because I can, you know...

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.515
So, which one is she?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.196
Third from left, down near the 20.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.873
Till they throw me out...

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.033
Congratulations, Billy.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.793
Lady is bangin'.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.030
What's her name?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.635
- Faison.
- "Faison". Damn.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.360
Depths and depths in young Billy.
Who'd have thought?

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.477
Though how the hell you talked her into it...

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.155
- I let her do most of the talking.
- Smart man.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.119
I got a feeling you're gonna
get laid a lot in life, Billy.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.919
Thanks, Sergeant.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.759
Thing is, I don't want to lose her.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.354
What?

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.550
Jesus Christ, Billy, lose what?

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.597
How long were you with her, ten minutes?

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.833
You're a hero. She was doing
something nice for the troops.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.832
And we're on post as of 2200 tonight,

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.594
so I don't know when you think
you're gonna see her again.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.391
- Do you have a problem?
- No, Sergeant.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.480
We're going back to Iraq, Billy.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.358
We're gonna be in the enemy's sights, and
you're gonna be the first one to get smoked

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.352
if you let your gun
get in the way of your rifle.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.639
Now, I want you to forget about
those pom-poms, and I mean fast.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.951
Every man's penis has the same IQ, Billy.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.350
Be smarter than your penis.
Do I make myself clear,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.113
- Specialist Lynn?
- Hooah, Sergeant.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.236
Good.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.232
Push it through, Dallas!

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.797
Tell you what, why don't you get her e-mail?

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.236
That way y'all can e-fuck
when we're back in Iraq.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.754
Enjoy the game.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.280
Albert, switch with me.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.472
Classic Hollywood.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.789
What?

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.712
Old-time Hollywood films.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.917
Movies about groups of men
working together fine,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.559
like you all, until some woman

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.279
- comes in and messes it up.
- There's no woman.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.794
There's always a woman.
Without a love interest,

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.553
- there's no story.
- Yeah, well...

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.359
Dime set me right about that.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.713
Well, listen, brotherly love is a great
thing, but all these people in this stadium

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.917
want to see you ride away
into the sunset with the girl.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.276
Without a woman, you ain't got shit, Billy.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.160
That's why I got married.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.357
Got to get your priorities straight.
Listen, don't worry,

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.318
we're gonna get this movie made right.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.550
Fuck 'em.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.799
- Fuck who?
- The studios.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.076
You guys keep protecting America,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.560
I'll keep pitching.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.199
You guys are the real heroes, man.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.351
You guys deserve to get this movie made.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.160
I'm on... I'm on it. All good.
Don't worry about it.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.829
Everything is bigger and better in Texas,
and our cheerleaders...

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.151
Hey, hey, sorry to interrupt.
We need to get you guys ready

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.436
- for halftime.
- Everyone here?

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.592
Good. Okay. First off,
what are y'all gonna wear?

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.036
What we're wearing, ma'am.
These are our dress uniforms.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.237
No way.
I'm already drowning in dress uniforms.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.596
I need you boys
to really stand out, you know?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.353
Give me some of that "bring it on" attitude.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.159
You guys are gonna be right up there,

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.035
on stage with Destiny's Child.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.476
Excuse me, ma'am. Doing what?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.398
We don't have anything prepared.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.079
We'll go over it after you change.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.594
Right now, we've got wardrobe issues.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.718
- What else you got?
- Just our DCUs.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.871
That's our desert camouflage.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.998
Did you say "camo"? That's perfect!

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.549
Josh, get these boys
battle-ready for halftime ASAP.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.552
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.112
- It's gonna be fine.
- "Battle-ready"?

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.873
Come on, it'll be great.
It'll be great. Let's go.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.276
- Let's go, guys.
- Okay, time to shine.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.995
Bravo 2-2. This is Bravo 2-6 Alpha.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.912
Go ahead, Bravo 2-6.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.438
We have a civil affairs unit in contact,
vicinity Al-Ansakar village. Break.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.557
Looks like they're trying
to take hostages. Break.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.478
Move immediately to the east entrance

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.115
and cover until BG4 arrives. How copy? Over.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.760
Roger that, Bravo 2-6. Over.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.036
Stand by for follow-on tasking.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.794
Stay sharp, 2-2. Bravo 2-6 out.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.317
AI-Ansakar... We just built the school there.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.234
That's why the teenagers
keep shooting at us.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.352
We don't know what's up there,
so hold the trucks here.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.432
We'll radio you after we assess.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.474
LT wants us to secure that site
for a medevac when BG4 arrives.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.119
Against the wall.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.197
- Come on.
- Enemy?

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.599
I'm guessing the same militia shitheads
that shot up Charlie company last week.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.871
Sergeant, is this it?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.520
All good. Stay focused.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.638
Ladies, Hajji's gonna pop your cherry.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.153
And he's not the kind of guy
to take you to dinner first.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.551
These men are fighters.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.236
This is their house,
and you respect a man in his house.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.437
Now, warriors...

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.910
Embrace your fear
and let your training guide you.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.400
We ready?

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.718
All right.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.440
Scan your rooftops and watch your corners.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.032
I love you, Lynn.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.079
Roger that, Sergeant.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.674
I love you, Sykes.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.319
Copy, Sergeant.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.712
I love you, Lodis.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.439
Word, Sergeant.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.557
- I love you, Crack.
- I love you.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.279
I love you, Mango.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.479
Yes, Sergeant.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.755
I love you, Foo.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.917
Love you, Sergeant.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.755
Yeah, yeah. Let's go get
a middle school named after us.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.669
They're looking for hostages again.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.989
Stay down!

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.317
Fuck. They're creeping up on the left side.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.471
Get to that wall. Day, stay on the left.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.914
- Keep an eye on that two-story.
- Copy.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.760
Dime, set security on the right.
BG4's coming in that way.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.035
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll take the first shot.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.520
Then get ready to move.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.637
Come on.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.432
Ten! Nine!

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.799
Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four...

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.837
- Billy, I don't know about this.
- It's all good, Sykes.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.673
We're on the field. The stadium.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.638
Just follow me
and do everything I do, okay?

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.353
Ladies and gentlemen, from Iraq,

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.319
the heroes of the Battle of Al-Ansakar,

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.551
- the pride of the United States...
- Like lambs to the slaughter.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.875
I fuckin' knew it, man.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.634
The intrepid young soldiers of Bravo!

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.910
Beyoncé!

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.709
Hit me!

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.551
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.111
please welcome Kelly, Michelle and Beyoncé,

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.475
the hit singing sensation,

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.676
Destiny's Child!

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.073
Fuck! Fuck, man!

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.197
It's okay. Keep going! Come on.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.835
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.069
Get the fuck off me!

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.197
I'm sorry, man. Just trying to help.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.514
It's just fireworks, dude! It's cool!

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.875
Hey, man, this is all kinds of fucked up.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.792
- Twelve o'clock, what do you see?
- Shadows...

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.600
Beyoncé. Destiny's fucking Child, dude,
right in front of you.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.080
Ignore all the other shit.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.475
Keep your eyes focused
on the good stuff, all right?

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.953
Let's go! Let's go!

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.398
Out of the way, please! Out of the way!

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.160
Come on.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.999
What the hell is going on?
Come on, let's stick together!

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.072
- Sykes, are you all right?
- I'm fine, Sergeant.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.270
There you are!

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:39.470
Okay, that was kind of hairy,
but you guys made it.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.711
Now, when this screen flies up,
I want you guys to step out

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.154
and march down the stairs.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.840
And for you, you have an extra cue.
You know "Soldier"?

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.673
The song Soldier.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.192
In the first bridge where they sing,
"They wanna spend that on me,"

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.352
that's your signal to move
to your special mark downstage.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.639
Now, here's the important part.
Once y'all hit your marks,

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.189
you have to stay absolutely still
until the show's over

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.273
no matter what is going on around you.
Think you can manage?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.954
All right, let's get you
in a nice straight line.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.159
- Straight line.
- On your marks.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.839
Come on, come on...

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.031
What the fuck did she just say?

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.192
I want a soldier

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.356

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.751

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.591
Holliday, get the.50s up here
to cover our movement!

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.672
- Let's go!
- Bravo team, on me!

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.593
Put some smoke in their fuckin' faces!

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:53.599
Mango, Sykes, get their heads down!

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.192
- Smoke out!
- Smoke out!

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.710
Let's get ready to move!

01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.995
Okay, let's go!

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.475
Down to that rock pile and through the gate!

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.314
- Alpha team, when we move, shift fire!
- Hooah!

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.672
Lynn, Foo, when we get to that pile,
throw everything you got on that gate!

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.036
Dime, you and Crack
start working your way to the wounded!

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.839
- Mango!
- Hooah!

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.159
It's going down.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.273
What?

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.714
I'm going down.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.555
Shit!

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.040
Damn it, where the fuck did that come from?

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.074
Two o'clock in that building!

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.992
Foo, prep those AT4s.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.555
- Level that motherfucker!
- Roger that, Sarge!

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.519
Damn it, Sykes, get down!

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.633
- He's down there!
- Fuck!

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.560
What the fuck?

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.597
- Call out the building!
- Fuck.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.712
Call out the building!

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.314
He's hit!

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.871
- Shroom's been hit!
- Fire those motherfuckers now!

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.469
Get those fuckers in there!

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.755
Backblast area clear!

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.309
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.478
Backblast area clear!

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:05.750
Fuck, yeah!

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.320
- Put that on my tab, motherfucker!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.669
Crack, get down!

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.433
- Okay!
- Bravo, on me!

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.152
Let's push up, set security. Mango,

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.915
Sykes, cover our movement.
Get ready to move to Breem. On me.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.800
Goddamn it, Lynn! Cover him!

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.600
Hang in there, Sergeant.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.119
Medic!

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.554
Billy.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.034
Hey, Billy.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.192
Halftime show's over.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.238
Dude, we finally saw Beyoncé.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.471
Yeah, well, ain't we fuckin' special.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.756
Sergeant, I feel bad.
That was some kind of fucked-up shit.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.519
Just another normal day in America, Billy.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.393
We strike the set in nine minutes.
You guys have to go.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.830
Fuck off.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.553
Hey. I told you get the hell off my stage.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.233
- Dude, don't touch me.
- Chill out, chill out.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.920
- Nobody told us where to go.
- Come on.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.713
I don't give a fuck where you go.
You can't stay here.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.359
Second half starts in nine minutes.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.071
All right, Rufus, I'll tell you what.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.316
We'll go right after
you're done sucking my dick.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.550
How about...

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.160
- What the fuck, man?
- Stand down!

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.396
Fuck off!

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.670
- Hey, break it up!
- What the hell is going' on?

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.080
Fuckers didn't move when I asked them to.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.435
We got fucking work to do!

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.757
I suggest you get back to it. Now.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.431
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- We're good.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.354
I'm frankly astonished
to see our military behaving...

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.794
Sir!

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.235
Excuse me, sir.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.631
That is so not the way we treat our guests.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.473
These are American heroes,

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.831
here at the personal invitation
of Mr. Norman Oglesby.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.632
We'll take charge now, thank you very much.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.276
Come on, guys.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.478
- Nice work, dude.
- Hey, girl.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.750
- Hi.
- Sorry about that.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.274
- Hey, fellas.
- You're my best friend.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.915
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.919
I can't believe
they just left y'all stranded there.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.629
And what happened to your nice uniforms?

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.514
Stage manager said we should look
more "battle-ready" for halftime.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.514
Well, ready or not,
you still look pretty darn cute.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.750
Really?

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.719
And you looked great.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.678
That trippy little step
you were doing earlier.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.513
- Come on.
- What's wrong with him?

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.432
Sykes is kind of an emotional guy.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.239
He just misses his wife and kids.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.476
The sacrifices you guys make.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.400
Sometimes I wonder if we really deserve
what y'all are doing for us.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.439
I mean, before I met you,
I'd be worried about

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.196
silly little stuff like my car's engine
making a funny noise

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.840
or my roommate's cat scratching up the sofa.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.750
While you're on the other side of the world,
getting shot at by folks

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.031
who would just as soon
blow us all up to Kingdom Come.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.796
Well, ma'am, I guess that's just
what we're trying to prevent.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.070
Billy, to have you come into my life,
it's just like...

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.190
Five minutes, ladies.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.396
Shoot. Second half's starting.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.193
Listen, why don't we stay in touch?

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.599
Yeah. I mean...

01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.156
Yes.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.232
Yeah, I think, we should. Definitely yes.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.710
Good.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.837
Get out your phone,
I'll give you my information.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.392
Then you can call me
and leave a message so I'll have yours.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.154
'Cause, frankly, I do not want to lose you.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.872
- What's your last name?
- Zorn.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.871
I know. Everyone thinks it's funny.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.799
It means "anger" in German.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.075
Roger that.

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.075
You got a call from Kathryn.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.152
That's my sister.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.390
- Okay, there's you.
- "Zorn."

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.639
Always last on everyone's list.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.316
I'll change you to "Anger,"
that way you'll be first.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.070
- Sweetie.
- Faison, come on.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:42.754
I gotta go.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.750
You guys, I'm so sorry. I totally apologize.
That was 110% my fault.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.877
I don't know what happened. I am so sorry.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.078
We blew it. We just blew it because they
were supposed to bring you up immediately,

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.072
and then I was waiting for you
for, like, 20 minutes,

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.230
and I don't really know what happened.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.549
Josh, you hear about the fight we just had?

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.955
- With the roadies?
- Wait.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.759
Wait a second.
What do you mean, "fight"? Guys.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.511
Joshy, Joshy, Joshy, it's good, man.
Relax, okay?

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.751
- Hey.
- Jesus, Billy. I've been trying you.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.195
I know. I'm sorry.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.950
You know me,
banging all those cheerleaders.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.634
Yeah, right.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.757
Listen, I'm on the freeway, okay?
I'm coming to get you.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.513
Did Dr. Schatten
arrange that appointment yet?

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.549
He left a message.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.473
- Look, Kat, you really think...
- No, I know. Trust me.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.874
There's no way I'll let those fuckers
take my brother away.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.637
- What are you laughing at?
- You.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.949
I should just take you with me.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.993
You'd kick Hajji's ass.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.274
Listen, what you're about to do
is the right thing.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.710
Billy, it's the right thing.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.793
Just tell me where I can find you
after the game, and I'm there, okay?

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.870
All right.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.913
Drive to the yellow loading area.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.356
- It's a black stretch Hummer.
- A stretch Hummer?

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.320
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that's us.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.519
But, Kat, I don't know.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.956
It'll be hard to leave the guys.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.396
Just hold tight, Billy, okay?
I'll be right there.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.230
Love you.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.400
Raise it. And praise it.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.510
We must let the world...

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.710
...that we will persevere.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.117
- Hallelujah!
- Losers.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.555
Come on.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.551
Dude, what the fuck happened to your eye?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.793
Dude, what happened to your face?

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.358
Hey, Travis, man.
Don't mess with these guys.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.030
These guys are the Bravos.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.720
The what-hos?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.674
Yeah, I heard of you guys.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.640
Goddamn. You're famous?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.636
Tell me something, Bravos.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.237
What do you think about gays in the military?

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.438
At least they got the balls to join.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.878
I hear ya, dude, serving your country
and all that, very cool,

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.876
but guys blowing each other in foxholes?

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.280
That sounds kind of wack to me.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.792
Like maybe it's got something to do with
why we're getting our butts kicked in Iraq.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.312
Shit, Billy, this guy seriously
needs to shut the fuck up.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.755
- What?
- Yup.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.876
I'll tell you what.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.710
Why don't you join up?

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.639
Why don't you get in a foxhole with me
and see what happens?

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.360
Hey, man,
I'm just messing with you, all right?

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.558
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
I'm totally down with that.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.639
I don't give a shit if you guys are
gay, bi, tranny.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.833
You're the real American heroes.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.480
No? Whatever, man. It's cool.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.991
I still support the troops. Go, Dallas!

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.719
- Let's go, guys.
- Yeah, Dallas!

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:42.672
- So, how does that feel, baby?
- Okay.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.672
- Does that feel good? Yeah.
- That's funny, right?

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.638
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.234
- Hey. Let go.
- This is one of the things we learn

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.118
in basic training
when we're not blowing each other.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.600
- Hey.
- That's right.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.356
Relax, relax.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.120
Hey, this is what happens
when you cut off the blood flow to the brain.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.032
- Hey. Hey. Shut up.
- How's that feel?

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.270
He's fine. He's just joking.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.510
That feel good, boy?

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.110
Hey, I'm just having a little fun here
with "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.351
- Do something.
- Arm down. Put your fucking arm down.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.039
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Come on. He can't breathe.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.270
- Crack.
- He's gay?

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.870
Fucking asshole.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:15.510
Travis. Travis, hey.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.553
- Hey, Travis. Come on.
- Hey, Travis, wake up!

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.353
Would you wake up and give me a kiss, boy?

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.991
- Wake up, Travis. Come on.
- Come back anytime, okay?

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.311
- Yo, Travis, wake up.
- Travis, babe.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.791
Travis, wake up.
Stand up. Stand up. Come on.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.639
- Sergeants.
- Anytime.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.640
Hey, shut your mouth.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.310
- Something I should know about?
- Guy was mouthing off.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.995
Crack gave him some corrective training.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.160
Okay, children, drink up.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.390
Y'all gotta get sharp.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.155
Hooah.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.159
He's pretty wasted there, Sergeant.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.039
He'll be fine once he's back on base.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.953
- It's the rest of us that I'm worried about.
- Look.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.198
Push it through, Dallas!

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.670
Sergeant, if you had a choice,
would you go back?

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.516
To Iraq, I mean.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.320
I don't have a choice, do I?

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.194
So your question lacks relevance.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.999
- But if you did have a choice.
- But I don't.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.116
- But if you did.
- But I don't.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.873
- I'm just saying.
- Shut!

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.790
Do you wish we had a choice,
is that what you're asking?

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.200
Well...

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.316
We don't, Sergeant.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.159
That is correct, Specialist Lynn, we don't.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.552
We're in the thick and deep
and all we have is each other.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.036
That's why we need to keep our shit
high and tight,

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.349
and watch out...

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.078
This better be good, Albert,
because we are runnin' out of fuckin' time.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:54.800
Yeah?

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.639
Are you available for a meeting?

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.520
Am I what?

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.993
- Sure. When?
- Now, with Norm.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.039
Albert says Norm wants to make our movie.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.952
- Holy shit.
- What?

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.919
Albert comes through in the clutch.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.955
After all that bullshit,
the man keeps his word, shit.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.514
I just hope Hilary Swank

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.670
- thinks about playing Billy again.
- Shut up.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.479
Come on, Billy. We're on our way.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.079
Could you please tell Mr. Oglesby
that they're here?

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.793
- Thank you.
- I'll tell him. I'll tell him.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.234
Yo.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.680
All right, guys, here's the deal.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.355
I've been talking to Norm. He's inspired.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.796
He's all over Bravo.
He wants to make the picture.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.474
Might as well. His team sure sucks.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.230
He wants to do it right.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.391
The only thing is, he has a little
problem with the option price.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.598
Hundred thousand for eight men.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.190
- That's a lot of cash.
- Hear that, Billy?

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.395
What's that, Sergeant?

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.880
That's the sound of us getting fucked.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.314
Dave, have some faith, man.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.792
Look, Norm ain't no...
He ain't no Santa Claus.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.234
We all know that. In fact, they floated
around an idea of making you two the stars

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.390
- and forgetting about the others.
- No.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.640
That's what I said.
I said Bravo lives by the warrior code.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.120
You guys don't leave anyone behind.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.520
Show some goddamn respect, Albert.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.156
I got nothing but, Dave. Nothing but.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.398
I'm on your team, okay? Relax.

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.915
I am relaxed. Billy's relaxed, too.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.639
- Aren't you, Billy?
- Totally relaxed, Sergeant.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.558
- He's totally relaxed.
- Okay, hang with me.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.472
Guys, I'm gonna get you there, okay?

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.518
So, right now what they're offering is,

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.393
you'll be deferring monies up front

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.597
against a net profit percentage
on the back end.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.155
How much?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.150
It ain't a lot to start with.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:43.358
- $5,500 against the profits.
- Fifty-five fucking hundred?

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.313
You said 100,000 up front.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.952
I said "possibly."
You guys had major heat coming in.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:52.314
But two weeks?
That's like two years in Hollywood time.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.520
It breaks my heart to say, man,
but people move on.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.114
"People move on."

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.074
People move on.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.193
Everybody supports the troops.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.792
Hell, yeah, "We're so fucking
proud of our troops,"

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.758
but when it comes to actual money,

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.275
then all of a sudden
we're stuck in everybody's tight-ass budget.

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.636
Talk is cheap, I get that. Talk is cheap.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.074
But money screams.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.512
This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.714
I think we should all fear for it.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.515
I do, Dave. I truly do.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.800
Yeah, right.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.714
So you're saying
this is the best offer we got?

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.152
I'm saying this is the only offer we got.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.430
I got to call the men.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.549
Holliday.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.759
Will you ask the guys
what they think of $5,500 apiece?

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.551
...fucking apiece, guys. What do you think?

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.991
- Fuck that!
- He can kiss my fucking brown ass!

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.596
Your thoughts, Billy?

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.113
What do you think we should do?

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.434
- I...
- Look, Dave...

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.394
If you think you can do better,
you come talk to the man.

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.274
Come on.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.274
Mr. Oglesby.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.513
We got a goddamn hole in the fence!

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.956
- What's he doing calling trips right 90 jet?
- Okay.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.153
They were in Cover 2. We run 494 bingo.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.914
- That's what we do.
- Run 494 bingo. Screen pass...

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:35.672
Well, gentlemen, welcome to the War Room.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.753
I apologize for today.
Not our most stellar effort.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.638
I hate to lose.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.712
Rather cut off my little finger than lose.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.676
Well...

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:48.351
Maybe we'll turn it around in the fourth.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.677
So, Albert, you tell our friends
about our plans for their film?

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.752
- I sure did.
- Let's face it,

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.070
a lot of people
are discouraged about this war.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.916
They forget that some things
are actually worth fighting for.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.195
Please sit down.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.274
Now, I think Bravo's story

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.558
will go a long way toward reinvigorating
our commitment to this war.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.710
Now, I'm not interested
in making a good movie.

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.355
I want to make something great.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.635
What makes you think you can?

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.480
Pardon?

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.634
Can you deliver, sir?

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.672
You want to buy our story for 5,500 bucks.

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.712
That sure sounds like chump change to me.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.793
Hell, my granny could swing that deal
with a trip to the ATM.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:31.113
With all due respect, Mr. Oglesby,
show us you're serious.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.960
Show us you're a player.

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.272
Look around you, son.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.078
Look around and think for a moment
about everything you see.

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.472
Take a good, hard look...

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.598
And you tell me, am I a player?

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.874
Now, we need maximum flexibility
to get this movie together.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:58.560
But your risk won't be greater than it is
for any other investor, myself included.

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.672
May I speak frankly, sir?

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.913
Why stop now?

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.073
We're soldiers, sir.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.518
We feel like we've already got
enough risk in our lives.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.393
Now, I understand that 100,000

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.073
might have been
an overly optimistic number,

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.150
but after all they've been through,

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.590
my men don't deserve to be stuck
in somebody's bottom line.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.592
Now, if you can just find it in your heart...

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.240
Sergeant Dime, my offer stands.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.316
Now, it may not be as much as
you fellas were hoping for,

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.234
but from what I hear,
it's the only offer you've got.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:29.713
And I think most people agree
something is better than nothing.

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.360
"Something" would be nice.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.916
"Something" would be great.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.834
But it's just...

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.240
I don't know, sir.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.954
It's just so sad.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.914
We thought you kind of liked us.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.910
But I do.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.554
I do like you.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.912
I think the world of you fine young men.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.874
See, Billy? He does like us.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.270
He likes us so much
he's gonna fuck us in the face.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.398
Hey, hey. The sergeant and I
need to have a little talk.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.873
You don't have to go, Billy.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:13.952
Let Sergeant Dime cool off a bit.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.073
Could you excuse us for a moment?

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.311
Dime is direct. I appreciate that.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.754
Even if his language
is a bit salty for my taste.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.637
So I'm gonna be straight with you, that okay?

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.552
It's a free country, sir.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.950
That's right. Freest in the world.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.073
And with that freedom
comes responsibilities.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.597
Now, what you did that day
at AI-Ansakar Canal

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.160
was caught on camera, Billy.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:42.032
And for many folks,
that's where the war became real.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.272
But for us, the war's always been real, sir.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.316
- And we never needed cameras to tell us that.
- Of course.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.156
You know, I was never tested
like you've been, Billy.

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:53.871
Young man forged in the crucible of war.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.992
I never did get to Vietnam.

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.549
You know things
most of the rest of us will never know.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.357
That kind of friendship,

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.432
the taste of death
in the back of your throat,

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.873
your enemy going limp
with a final twist of the knife.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.520
Well, anyway,

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:14.799
what I'm trying to say is,

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.440
I can't begin to imagine
what you went through personally.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.354
Thank you for saying that, sir.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.000
And being celebrated as a hero,

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.311
that's got to weigh heavy
on a young man's shoulders.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.550
Makes me feel like
I've got no say in things, sir.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.560
I sympathize.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.511
But your story, Billy...

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.513
You got to understand,
it no longer belongs to you.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.592
It's America's story now.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:40.919
That's what this country's built on.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.560
You take this great state of Texas,

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.512
cattle, land, oil.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.913
Those things made us rich.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.120
But what made us Texas
is the story of some local boys

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.795
that made a valiant stand at the Alamo.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.193
And so it is with this war, Billy.

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.471
It's all about ideas.

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.680
Your battle foreshadows America's triumph
over the forces of terror.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.392
Bravo is us.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.590
And that's why you got to get your boys
to accept my offer.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.996
Glad to have you back, Sergeant Dime.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.671
Billy and I have been having
a little man-to-man.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.910
He's wrong, Sergeant.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.030
Who's wrong?

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.430
You are, Mr. Oglesby, sir.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.080
What I did, what we did,
isn't just some story or idea.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.873
It's our lives.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.679
You've got no clue what it means.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.753
You just... You want to turn it
into something it's not.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:44.519
We wouldn't cut a deal with you
even if you weren't such a tightwad.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.834
I mean, Hajji has more respect for us
than you do.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.869
Sometimes nothing is better than something.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:53.919
And about the Alamo?

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.711
Mexico kicked Texas' ass.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.157
All due respect, sir.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.712
Well, sir, Bravo's spoken.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.634
Let's go, Billy.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.320
I think our business is done here.

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.392
- We'll form up in the loading area.
- I'll let the driver know.

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:17.159
Hey. Billy.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.800
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.594
Hey, Billy.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.591
I thought a bathroom break was in order.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:35.474
Give Norm a little space.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.719
I got to say, though, Billy,

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.520
the way you stood up
to that arrogant prick in there,

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.150
now, that, that's what we call in my world
"a real movie moment".

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.831
I don't know, maybe I was just talking shit.

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.638
The truth is, for most of the guys,
something is better than nothing.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:54.872
No. You got to do what you know is right,
and that sure in the hell wasn't right.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.239
What you guys go through, Billy,

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.198
it's real hard for us over here to get it,

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.000
but we need to get it,
and the country needs to get it.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.670
Yeah.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.312
Well, I'm sorry for wrecking your deal.

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.432
I know how hard you work for us.

01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.989
No. Getting the offer is bad enough.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.840
Hard part is making a decision,
and that's on you.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.117
We gonna get this done,
and we gonna get it done right.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.112
I just got to start thinking outside the box.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.317
Hell, I'll go to China if I have to.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.876
So you guys just take care over there, now.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.589
We'll talk soon.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.080
I'm on it. It's all good.

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:36.550
- I'm sorry, guys.
- It's cool, man.

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.280
I know you've been looking out for us.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.919
Taking one for the team.

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.000
Yeah, you the man, Billy Lynn.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:53.874
- You okay, Billy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.551
Fuck it. Better this movie not get made, man.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.712
Shit, with Bravo starring,
people'll get so pumped up about the war,

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:02.269
they'd keep redeploying our asses
back to Iraq, you know?

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.034
- Wait, Sergeant, nobody's seen Major Mac.
- He'll show.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.074
There goes those fucking
asswipe dickheads again.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.992
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, guys, guys, guys!

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.400
- Hey, come on, now.
- Back down! Back down!

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.073
- Come on. Come on.
- Back up, you guys.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.480
- Come on, guys.
- Get back to work.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.115
Let's go. They're not worth it. Let's go.
Let's go. You all right?

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.190
- Get back to work.
- Everyone okay?

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.475
Hey, Josh, where's your kit?

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.989
What do you mean?

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.355
You're rolling with Bravo now, man.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.517
- Yeah, one of us, going to Iraq, man.
- Come on,

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.398
- I'm just gonna take you, 'cause I like you.
- No, no, no.

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:29.560
Boys, okay, that's my undercarriage.

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:31.438
Josh, man, you got to learn how to fight.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.638
- Hey. Where are you?
- Near the yellow loading area.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.552
I'm almost there. Hang on.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.240
I see you. I see you.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.953
God, why do you have to go?

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.474
No sacrifice too great. Duty first.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:07.757
Geez, I can't believe I just said that.

01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.632
I need you, Billy Lynn.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.792
Well, you can have me. Anytime.

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.310
I'd like that.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:19.472
I'd like any minute I can get with you.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.710
Girl...

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.317
I'd just about run away with you.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:50.915
"Run away"?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.992
But y'all are getting redeployed.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:56.194
You're a decorated hero.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.955
Right. Of course.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.273
I was just kidding.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.391
Well, I still got a long walk
ahead of me, so...

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.716
I guess I better get going.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.799
I'll pray for you.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.549
- Shut up.
- Thought we lost you there, Billy.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.070
No?

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.633
Suck my dick, you bunch of shits!

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.751
I'll fucking kill you, you fucking shit!

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.632
Get off! Get off me!

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.269
I'm going down.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.150
Boys!

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:23.596
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.232
Stand down. Stand the fuck down.

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.670
Fuck off.

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:57.200
Sarge?

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.274
Sarge?

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.315
Take them out!

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.079
Cover that fucking building.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.557
Fuck! Lynn!

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.789
He's gone, Sergeant.

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.678
Fuck. Come on, buddy.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.712
Come on, Shroom. Come on, buddy.

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:43.600
I knew it'd be you, man.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.478
I fucking knew it'd be you.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:47.313
I am so fuckin' proud of you.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.196
Hey, Billy. You still with us?

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.914
Yes, Sergeant.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.429
I'm not flaking on you.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.751
Good. I'm gonna need you, Billy.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.316
You got to help me
keep these clowns alive, okay?

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.914
Come on.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:15.191
All right, 2nd Squad, let's move on out.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.114
Okay, boys, your duffels, and your footballs,
are in the car already.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.475
It's been a pleasure.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:20.909
Real bad-ass, Josh...

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:23.634
Right back in time.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.360
One minute.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.354
Hey.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.912
Looking like I might die a virgin.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.916
That's really fucking hilarious, Billy.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.550
I'm going back, Kat.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:27.836
Good. You go back.

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:30.712
Trashing another country's easy.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.113
Standing up to your own...

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.713
That would take a real hero.

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.794
It's not fair, Kat.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.473
It's not fair.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.952
Nothing's fair.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.633
I'm not a hero, Kat.

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.314
I'm a soldier.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.872
That's what Shroom taught me.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.474
That's where I belong.

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.079
I'm not saying it's right,
but it's not wrong, either.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.480
It just is.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:09.313
I just wish there was some goddamn way
I could make you proud of me.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:26.152
I'm always proud of you.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.360
I love you.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:49.596
So, here you are, Billy.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.234
Yeah.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.590
I guess I always have been.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.192
You know, I've been thinking
these past two weeks

01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:59.158
that I know something.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.833
Something that civilians don't know,

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.159
but you know what?

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.357
They're the ones running this show.

01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.954
I mean, I've lived the damn war,

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.115
but it's still their war. Isn't it?

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.360
Their movie.

01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.349
We're a nation of children, Billy.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.591
We go somewhere else to grow up,

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:22.160
sometimes die.

01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:25.472
It's your time to step up.

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.634
Remember,

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.952
the bullet's already been fired.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.393
Yeah.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.680
I'm ready, Sergeant.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.874
I love you.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.320
I love you.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.834
I love you.

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.679
I love you, man.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.956
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:01.237
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.833
What do you want me to say?

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.234
I love you, too.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.799
We're good. Let's roll.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.753
- Hell, yeah.
- And get us the fuck out of here.

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.152
Yeah, before they kill us.

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.477
Take us someplace safe.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:36.074
Take us back to the war.

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.478
Take us home.

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.396
Seat belts, ladies.
