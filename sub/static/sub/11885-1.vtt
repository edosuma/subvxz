01:37.000 --> 01:40.099
- Morning, Oscar.
- Morning, Miss Albright.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.478
Finding a cab may take a while
in this mess. No umbrella?

01:44.584 --> 01:47.039
Really think I need one?

01:51.048 --> 01:53.219
Guess not.

01:56.679 --> 02:00.421
<i>- [Horn Honks]
- Thanks. Have a good one.</i>

02:01.639 --> 02:03.778
Oh.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.116
Nice. Bye.

02:10.439 --> 02:12.414
First stop,
66th and Broadway.

02:12.519 --> 02:14.625
I need to be there
in four minutes, please.

02:14.727 --> 02:16.898
[Laughs] Oh, yeah.
That's gonna happen.

02:16.999 --> 02:18.821
Hi. Dana?

02:18.919 --> 02:22.181
[Man On Phone] WNYH. You're caller seven.
Can you name our mystery song?

02:22.279 --> 02:24.102
Oops. I did it again. Sorry.

02:24.199 --> 02:26.022
That's right! You win!

02:27.463 --> 02:29.951
<i>Oh, that's like
five greens in a row.</i>

02:30.055 --> 02:32.259
The force is strong
this morning, boy.

02:32.359 --> 02:34.693
Dana, it looks like
I'm running a little early.

02:34.791 --> 02:37.344
So I'm gonna make a stop
at Balducci's. Muffin?

02:37.446 --> 02:40.414
I am the master of my universe.
Positive energy, positive results.

02:52.199 --> 02:55.396
Oh, perfect.
Taking the dog for a walk.

02:57.575 --> 03:01.371
Good morning, Mr. Phillips. I want to introduce
you to the hottest band in New York City.

03:01.479 --> 03:05.024
- [Dog Yipping]
- Magic time.

03:05.127 --> 03:08.160
Oh, perfect!

03:08.263 --> 03:10.783
Huh. Find a penny-

03:21.126 --> 03:23.614
Uh, Mr. Phillips?
Excuse me?

03:35.494 --> 03:37.317
<i>Here we go. Lift.</i>

03:41.958 --> 03:43.780
Good.
Walk it around.

03:43.878 --> 03:45.700
Bring it around.
Bring it around.

03:45.798 --> 03:47.075
<i>That's it.</i>

04:01.029 --> 04:02.917
<i>- [Man] Hey, hold it, please.
- Oh.</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:08.449
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

04:16.933 --> 04:19.519
<i>- [Dog Yipping]
- Come on, baby.</i>

04:19.620 --> 04:22.207
- [Whimpers]
- Baby made a poo-poo!

04:22.309 --> 04:25.157
<i>- Now, let's go.
- [Whistles]</i>

04:29.125 --> 04:31.711
Baby, your poo-poo's
costing me.

04:35.365 --> 04:37.275
Happy?

04:42.757 --> 04:45.659
- Hi. Good morning.
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.181 --> 04:56.898
[Laughs]
Sweet.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.930
- [Grunts]
- Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

05:20.037 --> 05:23.201
- What are you doing? Get off!
- I'm sorry. Are you o-

05:23.300 --> 05:25.373
Look, I'm- Let me help you up.
Stop hitting me!

05:25.477 --> 05:28.259
- Let me help you up! It was an accident!
- Oh, my God! Help!

05:28.356 --> 05:30.778
- Hey, you! Don't move!
- This is not-

05:30.884 --> 05:33.634
- Help! Help!
- This is not- not good. Not good.

05:33.732 --> 05:36.099
<i>- [Woman] Somebody!
- Stay there!</i>

05:36.197 --> 05:39.393
<i>- Let me help you up! Come on!
- Get that thing near me, and I'll smack it!</i>

05:39.492 --> 05:42.874
<i>I need backup! 288 in the park!
Hey, you! Stay there!</i>

05:42.980 --> 05:44.736
<i>- [Woman] I'll get you!
- The button popped!</i>

05:44.836 --> 05:46.659
<i>[Officer] Green jacket, skull cap.
Pursuing on foot.</i>

05:46.756 --> 05:49.058
We're making music here.
We're not making chicken.

05:49.156 --> 05:51.043
Well, get it done.
We need this done.

05:51.140 --> 05:54.817
<i>Sir, excuse me!
Good morning, Mr. Phillips!</i>

05:54.916 --> 05:57.054
- I have a brand-new-
- Got you!

05:57.156 --> 05:59.228
<i>- Mr. Phillips!
- Give me your arm, pervert!</i>

05:59.332 --> 06:01.471
<i>- Take a quick listen!
- You smell like dog crap!</i>

06:03.524 --> 06:07.004
Officer, could you take me
to the 36th Precinct?

06:07.108 --> 06:09.017
They're nice to me there.

06:11.268 --> 06:13.439
You promise? 6:00?

06:13.540 --> 06:16.257
Okay. I'll be the redhead
who looks like this.

06:16.356 --> 06:18.941
In that case,
I'll be there at 5:30.

06:19.044 --> 06:20.866
Okay.

06:25.092 --> 06:26.914
Morning, Maggie.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.986
Oh, what are you
so chipper about?

06:29.092 --> 06:31.458
[Sighs] Brad Pitt and Jude Law
had a baby...

06:31.555 --> 06:33.377
and I just met him in the elevator.

06:33.475 --> 06:35.297
<i>Braden & Company.
Can I help you?</i>

06:35.395 --> 06:37.697
Somebody ordered Balducci's.

06:37.796 --> 06:39.770
Oh, yum. Excuse me.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.177
What's happening on this body?
Is this a new coat?

06:42.275 --> 06:44.577
Yeah. Can you believe it?
Sample sale. Fifty percent off.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.228
- Ohh.
- And her coat met someone.

06:47.331 --> 06:50.746
David Pennington. Owner of
the Boston Celtics David Pennington?

06:50.851 --> 06:52.956
No, silly. It's his son.

06:53.059 --> 06:56.768
Impressive. But I, too,
had a really great morning.

06:56.867 --> 06:59.387
Apparently, Saturn
is in line with Neptune.

06:59.491 --> 07:02.240
Dana, you know those things
aren't exactly factual, right?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.274
Ooh! Ooh! And my new song
got a really polite rejection letter...

07:05.379 --> 07:07.201
from Two Tone Records.

07:07.299 --> 07:10.561
But you know what they say:
One door closes, and two doors open.

07:10.659 --> 07:13.473
<i>Speaking of doors, uh,
the Phillips meeting- When is it?</i>

07:13.570 --> 07:15.512
Now.

07:15.619 --> 07:18.040
All right, I've gotta
go take notes.

07:18.147 --> 07:20.219
- Okay.
- I will see you guys after.

07:20.323 --> 07:23.040
- Bye. Can I have one of those?
- Do you want the bran?

07:28.034 --> 07:29.922
Where is everybody?

07:36.738 --> 07:39.586
Look, our SoundScans
last week were 470,000.

07:39.683 --> 07:42.552
That's why we de-Yes, we deserve
to be at the front of the store.

07:42.659 --> 07:45.277
Look, you tell him
because I said so.

07:45.378 --> 07:49.153
You tell him Damon Phillips said so.
I'm hanging up now.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.389
I thought we had a meeting.

07:51.490 --> 07:53.465
Oh, they should be here soon.
If you'd care to-

07:53.570 --> 07:56.832
Wait? This is a big insult.
D. Doesn't wait for anybody.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.937
<i>Yeah, that's right.
No one. Okay?</i>

07:59.042 --> 08:00.732
And he is furious.
Ain't that right?

08:00.834 --> 08:02.721
It's true. I'm furious.

08:02.818 --> 08:06.593
They should be here
at any second. I promise.

08:06.690 --> 08:11.097
- [Alarm Continues Blaring]
- Are you kidding me, people!
Sara! Sara, do something!

08:18.241 --> 08:21.089
Oh, look! I just got
an I.M. From Miss Braden.

08:21.185 --> 08:23.869
And it says she's doing
some final touches...

08:23.970 --> 08:26.588
on an extra special presentation
for you, and she'll be right here.

08:26.689 --> 08:29.210
Right.

08:29.313 --> 08:33.023
Do you know how much Downtown
Masquerade Records made last year?

08:33.121 --> 08:35.707
Yes. 507 million, gross.

08:35.809 --> 08:39.552
Therefore, you know how much each
and every minute of my time is worth.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.472
$964.

08:41.570 --> 08:43.871
Damn, that's a lot of money.
I didn't expect that.

08:43.969 --> 08:46.140
<i>[Man] Yeah, and that includes
the time that you're sleeping.</i>

08:46.241 --> 08:49.023
So even when I go poo-poo,
I'm makin' money?

08:49.121 --> 08:51.903
<i>- That's some expensive shit.
- Damn skippy.</i>

08:52.001 --> 08:54.586
<i>So you see why I can't afford
to waste any time.</i>

08:55.841 --> 08:58.623
And this is wasted time!

08:58.721 --> 09:02.779
I completely understand that. If you could
just give me a moment, then I will start.

09:02.881 --> 09:06.907
Please. If it's not worth the minute,
then I will give you $965.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.667
Hmm.

09:08.769 --> 09:11.518
Because personally
I think you're underpaid.

09:15.649 --> 09:17.471
Hope you have
your checkbook.

09:25.569 --> 09:28.187
- They brought him into custody.
- Charlie caught the case?

09:28.289 --> 09:30.623
- Yeah.
- Charlie's crazy, you know.

09:30.721 --> 09:33.208
- Oh, I can't believe it's raining again.
- Oh. Yeah.

09:39.361 --> 09:42.230
- [Alarm Continues Blaring]
- Let me out! Let me out first!

09:44.256 --> 09:47.038
- Sara!
- Yes, uh, Miss-

09:47.136 --> 09:50.170
Right. No. Of course.

09:50.272 --> 09:53.306
Wha- Right.

09:53.408 --> 09:57.270
Damon. Damon, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

09:57.376 --> 09:59.514
- Uh-huh.
- [Sighs]

09:59.616 --> 10:01.689
With cheese. Okay.

10:01.792 --> 10:04.181
I just need to get the files,
and we can start the presentation-

10:04.288 --> 10:07.256
- No, no. We're done.
- Damon, please. The elevator was stuck.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.670
What are you talking about? Miss Albright
just pitched me your entire P.R. Strategy.

10:11.776 --> 10:14.142
It's brilliant. Especially
the part about the party.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.070
Oh. A p-party?

10:18.176 --> 10:20.064
Yeah, the masquerade
bash thing. I love it.

10:20.159 --> 10:22.167
<i>- Oh, you-you like that?
- Yeah.</i>

10:22.272 --> 10:26.876
It's a great way to showcase our talent and
get a tax write-off and support a good cause.

10:26.976 --> 10:30.271
And you know I can never
say no... to a party.

10:30.367 --> 10:33.880
<i>[Rapping] What you say.
What you say. What you say.</i>

10:33.984 --> 10:36.701
<i>Me too.
I love to par-tay.</i>

10:36.799 --> 10:39.069
Don't do that.

10:39.167 --> 10:42.069
<i>Got you covered, Mr. D.
Your car is right this way.</i>

10:42.176 --> 10:44.729
Masquerade bash?

10:44.831 --> 10:48.312
Uh, I'm really sorry,
Miss Braden. I just-

10:48.415 --> 10:51.764
I took notes at other meetings,
and then I just improvised from there.

10:51.872 --> 10:55.668
Well, looks like you've
got a big party to plan.

10:55.776 --> 10:58.231
Right. Right. Yeah.

10:58.335 --> 11:01.085
<i>Of course, you'll need
your own office.</i>

11:01.184 --> 11:04.828
- Wh- Me?
- Your idea. You're in charge. Sara?

11:04.927 --> 11:06.421
<i>- Huh?
- Find Ashley a new office...</i>

11:06.527 --> 11:09.789
- and get her a company credit card.
- Thank you, Miss Braden.

11:09.887 --> 11:13.335
Oh, please, Ashley.
From now on, it's Peggy.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.861
- Peggy.
- Peggy.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.934
- [Giggles]
- And you are?

11:19.039 --> 11:21.210
- Mail.
- Whatever.

11:21.311 --> 11:24.180
And don't worry, Ashley.
I'll be watching your every move.

11:24.287 --> 11:26.109
<i>- Sara.
- Yes, ma'am?</i>

11:34.879 --> 11:37.116
Katy, I'm home.

11:39.871 --> 11:42.075
Oh, hey, Jake.

11:42.174 --> 11:44.957
Hey. Wow.
What happened to you?

11:45.054 --> 11:48.796
- Fourth-grade boys.
- They're the worst, aren't they? Let me see.

11:48.894 --> 11:51.196
- What's it stuck on with?
- Krazy Glue.

11:51.295 --> 11:55.255
Huh, been there. At least
you had a better day than me.

11:55.358 --> 11:57.911
- Burger?
- Of course. Ketchup for you.

11:58.015 --> 11:59.989
- Katy, where's my bun?
- Oh, it's in the oven, Grandma.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.917
<i>- She's got a bun in the oven?
- Hey, Jake.</i>

12:02.015 --> 12:04.884
- Hey, Aunt Martha.
- Now, Katy...

12:04.991 --> 12:07.325
I'll be back after
my shift at midnight.

12:07.423 --> 12:09.277
Cool.

12:09.374 --> 12:12.156
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

12:12.254 --> 12:13.465
- Love you, Jake.
- Love you too.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.087
<i>- Katy, mind your cousin.
- I'll keep an eye on her.</i>

12:16.190 --> 12:17.499
<i>- See ya.
- Ready?</i>

12:17.598 --> 12:22.006
Wait. Is it gonna sting?
'Cause I kind of like wearing it.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.980
Well, it's not gonna sting
if you hold still.

12:25.086 --> 12:28.501
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Hold still! It's gonna be fine!

12:28.606 --> 12:31.867
Hold still.
One, two, three-

12:31.966 --> 12:35.130
There you go. There you go.
Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. All right.

12:35.230 --> 12:37.750
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Jake. You're my hero.

12:37.854 --> 12:40.701
Give me some skin.
You know, I'm gonna take this.

12:40.798 --> 12:43.187
This is definitely
a, uh, choking hazard.

12:43.294 --> 12:46.229
- All right.
- Bye.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.188
See ya.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.620
<i>- [Grunts] Not again! Oh!
- [Clattering]</i>

12:54.717 --> 12:56.539
So, where is he taking you?

12:56.637 --> 12:59.801
A basketball game.
His dad's team is playing Philly.

12:59.902 --> 13:02.268
Not sexy enough.
Home or away?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.187
- Away.
- Let me guess.

13:04.285 --> 13:07.187
On his private jet
which he flies himself?

13:07.294 --> 13:10.905
- So wrong. He has a pilot.
- Speaking of dates. Hello?

13:11.005 --> 13:13.787
<i>We should try to find
the dragon lady one for the bash.</i>

13:13.885 --> 13:16.536
That way, she won't be all over us,
watching our every move.

13:16.638 --> 13:20.664
Mm. Good luck. Men of Peggy's caliber
don't exactly take ads in the Yellow Pages.

13:20.765 --> 13:23.285
[Scoffs] Could you possibly
idolize her any more?

13:23.389 --> 13:25.942
<i>What? She's sophisticated, glamorous,
gets invited everywhere...</i>

13:26.045 --> 13:28.379
and never has to stay home
because she has nothing to wear.

13:28.477 --> 13:31.259
- Right. Nothing to wear.
- Wee, wee, wee.

13:31.357 --> 13:33.429
<i>- [Doorbell Rings]
- Coming!
- I'll get it.</i>

13:33.533 --> 13:34.874
- I'm coming.
- I'm coming!

13:34.973 --> 13:36.500
- Find an outfit.
- I found one.

13:36.604 --> 13:40.216
<i>- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Whoa. Who is that?</i>

13:40.317 --> 13:44.026
Down, girl. You're drooling on my doormat.
Oh, it's my next-door neighbor.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.067
- Who?
- Shh. Antonio.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.376
<i>- Oh, hey, Ashley.
- Hey.</i>

13:48.476 --> 13:51.346
Your dry cleaning was delivered
while you were out, so I took it.

13:51.453 --> 13:54.322
Oh, you are such an angel.
Thank you.

13:54.429 --> 13:57.909
- I do what I can. Big date tonight?
- Kind of big. You?

13:58.013 --> 14:00.696
- Ah, every night is date night.
- [Chuckles]

14:00.797 --> 14:02.585
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Thanks.

14:02.684 --> 14:04.572
- Bye.
- Oh, hey, Antonio.

14:04.668 --> 14:06.643
Are you free next Thursday?

14:06.749 --> 14:08.985
I'm never free.
What do you have in mind?

14:09.085 --> 14:11.092
Well, you won't want to miss this.

14:11.197 --> 14:14.164
<i>Masquerade Records is throwing
an outrageous promo party.</i>

14:14.268 --> 14:17.913
Food, fun, dancing...
and a blind date with my boss.

14:18.012 --> 14:20.052
Your boss?
What's she like?

14:20.156 --> 14:23.287
She's very smart, strong,
an independent woman.

14:23.389 --> 14:26.138
- Is she good-looking?
- Of course.

14:26.236 --> 14:29.465
Okay, look, if you think we'll hit it off,
then that's good enough for me.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.662
Oh, you're the best.
Thank you so much. Bye.

14:32.764 --> 14:35.415
- Bye.
- Oh, yes! A date for the dragon lady.

14:35.516 --> 14:38.582
- Yes!
- You know, this isn't mine.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.506
Whose is it?

14:40.604 --> 14:42.971
- Oh! Sarah Jessica Parker's.
- [Screams]

14:43.068 --> 14:44.661
- What?
- Not kidding.

14:44.763 --> 14:47.284
I did not know Sarah Jessica Parker
lived in your building.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.363
Oh, my God.
And look, it's Dolce.

14:49.467 --> 14:51.856
Oh, my gosh.
I can return it tomorrow.

14:51.964 --> 14:53.906
[Sighs]
Let me look. Oh, yes.

14:54.011 --> 14:56.313
Your size.
What are the odds?

14:56.412 --> 15:00.602
- Don't be jealous.
- You know, this might actually look cute on me.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.674
- You should totally wear it tonight.
- Well, of course.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.169
- Yeah, I'm gonna need some chocolate now.
- I'm gonna need some milk.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.676
I'm gonna go try on the dress.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.631

Sorry. Sorry. It's okay.

15:25.628 --> 15:28.661
Yo, one, two, check.
Sound check.

15:42.011 --> 15:44.214
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Mac.

16:04.635 --> 16:07.056
Hey, hey! Hey, Jake!

16:07.163 --> 16:09.781
Jake, how'd it go?

16:09.883 --> 16:12.338
So, uh- So you got
Phillips the CD?

16:12.442 --> 16:15.791
Uh, not ex- not exactly.

16:15.899 --> 16:18.866
You know, we just had some
scheduling conflicts we had to deal with.

16:18.970 --> 16:21.654
Jake, this has been
going on for weeks.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.577
Guys, we're right on track.
Trust me.

16:23.674 --> 16:26.424
There are even gonna be a couple
of "A" and "R" guys here tonight.

16:26.522 --> 16:29.456
Hey, Jake. There's a clogged toilet
in the men's room.

16:29.562 --> 16:32.213
Uh, and I'm looking forward
to plunging it, Mac...

16:32.314 --> 16:35.543
but not until my shift starts,
which is in two hours.

16:35.642 --> 16:38.577
Pretend it's a Grammy.

16:38.682 --> 16:41.682
Grammy? Grammy it is. Okay.

16:41.786 --> 16:45.844
So I'm gonna take care of this.
Keep up the energy.

16:45.946 --> 16:49.045
Hit that "G", Tom. We're gonna
have a great show tonight, guys.

17:10.233 --> 17:12.599
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.316
I thought we were taking a jet.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.240
This takes us to the jet.

17:17.338 --> 17:21.113
Oh, wow. This is definitely
going in my diary. [Squeals]

17:21.209 --> 17:25.464
Good evening, Bayonne. Ashley,
where did you get that gorgeous dress?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.384
[Laughs]
Don't ask.

17:56.089 --> 17:57.911
- Hi. How are ya?
- Hi.

17:58.009 --> 17:59.831
Guys, you're on.

Gentlemen, enjoy the show.
Cocktails on us.

<i>- [Jake Yells]
- Hey, fellas, come on.</i>

18:58.008 --> 19:00.495
You're firing me?
You don't even pay me.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.862
Look, Jake, you're good.
I mean, you did find us.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.782

- But? What's the but?

19:05.879 --> 19:07.854
<i>But wejust think

19:07.960 --> 19:10.261
No, you can't go back home.
We're this close, guys.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.782
Jake, we haven't had
any lucky breaks over here.

19:12.888 --> 19:16.052
And poor Doug misses his mum.
Yeah, he does. He cries every night.

19:16.152 --> 19:18.257
<i>- [Yells]
- One week. How's that?</i>

19:18.359 --> 19:21.141

You give me one week.</i>

19:21.239 --> 19:24.174
<i>And if I can't make it happen
for you guys by then, then I get it.</i>

19:24.279 --> 19:27.541
We're done. You can go back home.
No hard feelings. One week.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.061
- Okay. One week.
- One week.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.077
- One week.
- All right!

19:32.184 --> 19:35.893
- Get some rest, guys.
- Mum's gonna have to wait
one more week, Doug.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.989
One week.

19:40.151 --> 19:43.413
- [Japanese]
- So, did you?

19:43.512 --> 19:45.366
Okay, David Pennington
is a gentleman.

19:45.463 --> 19:47.732
- We kissed.
- Boring.

19:47.831 --> 19:49.424
<i>- Check please, Zuki.
- Okay.</i>

19:49.528 --> 19:51.797
<i>- Thank you.
- So, was it a, um, normal kiss...</i>

19:51.895 --> 19:54.197
or was it a supernatural,
tingling in your toes...

19:54.295 --> 19:56.564
butterflies in your tummy
sort of kiss?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.630
It was... enough to get him
to ask me on another date.

19:59.735 --> 20:01.972
- Mm!
- [Laughs]

20:02.071 --> 20:04.111
- Thank you.
- No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

20:04.215 --> 20:06.255
Uh-W-Wait.
What's that?

20:06.358 --> 20:08.660
Senor Platinum
says lunch is on him.

20:08.759 --> 20:11.988
- I can't stand this.
- What?

20:12.087 --> 20:15.916
Now, on top of everything else, Peggy Braden
has given you worldwide buying power?

20:16.023 --> 20:18.324
Okay, there's positive energy,
and then there's just plain dumb luck.

20:18.423 --> 20:21.205
Here we go again. Maggie, you've known me
since seventh grade, right?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.670
Okay, will you please
tell her that I'm not lucky?

20:23.767 --> 20:27.116
Well, you were voted
prom queen at Franklin High.

20:27.223 --> 20:29.590
- So?
- We went toJefferson.

20:30.935 --> 20:32.789
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Okay.

20:32.886 --> 20:34.959
- What? Are you kidding me?
- Thank you, Ashley.

20:35.062 --> 20:37.004
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Ashley.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.933
- Thank you, Ashley.
- But face it, babe...

20:39.031 --> 20:41.845
when they whacked you with that
lucky stick, they whacked you good.

20:41.942 --> 20:44.331
- You guys are silly.
- [Speaking Japanese]

20:44.439 --> 20:46.261
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.741
Okay. All right. If you don't think
you have the luck gene...

20:49.847 --> 20:51.669
then you wouldn't mind
taking a little test.

20:51.766 --> 20:53.589
<i>- Test?
- Yeah.</i>

20:53.686 --> 20:55.509
Test? Cool.
What kind of test?

20:58.230 --> 21:00.052
<i>- Ooh, sorry.
- Excusez-moi.</i>

21:00.150 --> 21:01.906
- Hi. One scratcher, please.
- Oh!

21:02.006 --> 21:03.599
- What kind?
- You wanna pick?

21:03.703 --> 21:07.215
- This is not a fair test.
I happen to be good at these.
- The green one.

21:07.318 --> 21:09.652
It's a lottery.
Nobody's good at them.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.855
<i>- Dollar.
- Thank you.</i>

21:11.958 --> 21:14.827
- [Sighs] Guys-
- Come on!

21:14.934 --> 21:17.105
I mean, seriously, this is silly.

21:17.206 --> 21:20.075
- Do it. Do it. Do it.
- Fine. No peeking.

21:20.181 --> 21:22.287
- Why?
- It's my scratcher now.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.428
What'd you get? What'd you get?
What'd you get?

21:25.526 --> 21:28.396
Five, 10, 15.
I told you I was good at these.

21:28.502 --> 21:30.771
You are the luckiest
person in the world.

21:30.870 --> 21:32.844
How do you do it, Ash?
How do you do it?

21:32.950 --> 21:35.252
I told you. You just
scratch the silver boxes.

21:35.349 --> 21:38.578
Scratch? You just scratch?
I could kill you!

21:38.677 --> 21:41.808
Hey, watch it. I can't afford to be injured.
I've got a major event to plan.

21:41.909 --> 21:45.706
And we have a walk-through downtown
with Peggy in 10 minutes.

21:45.813 --> 21:48.879
Taxi! We have to pick up the presentation
boards. We're never gonna make it.

21:48.981 --> 21:51.086
Negativity.
That's your problem.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.907
- That's true. Bye, sweets!
- Make mama proud!

21:54.005 --> 21:57.039
<i>- Of course. Love you.
- Au revoir!</i>

21:59.126 --> 22:01.264
- How you feeling?
- Nervous.

22:01.365 --> 22:03.187
- She's gonna love it.
- Okay.

22:03.285 --> 22:05.107
- How about right here?
- Yeah.

22:05.205 --> 22:08.020
- This place is amazing!
- Quick. She's ready.

22:08.117 --> 22:10.157
- Hi, Miss Braden.
- Uh!

22:10.261 --> 22:14.385
Sorry. Peggy. So, are you
ready to be impressed?

22:14.485 --> 22:17.834
- I'm ready to have questions.
- Of course. I would hope so.

22:19.957 --> 22:23.502
Okay, so we're going
for a carnival-like atmosphere.

22:23.605 --> 22:25.994
We'll have an upscale mixture
of V.I.P.'s, celebs...

22:26.101 --> 22:28.468
<i>and record industry insiders.</i>

22:28.565 --> 22:30.703
Only, everyone will wear masks.

22:30.805 --> 22:33.042
Interesting.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.962
We'll have a deejay,
circus performers...

22:35.060 --> 22:38.126
fortune-tellers,
atmosphere smoke and neon.

22:38.229 --> 22:40.498
Over here will be the V.I.P. Area.

22:40.597 --> 22:43.117
We'll have champagne-
only the best.

22:43.221 --> 22:46.799
<i>Dom Pérignon served
by waiters on stilts.</i>

22:46.900 --> 22:50.730
<i>And then a stage with Masquerade's
latest videos and professional dancers.</i>

22:52.660 --> 22:55.049
<i>And over there, little alcoves...</i>

22:55.157 --> 22:57.775
<i>with couches and with drapes
to give people privacy.</i>

22:57.877 --> 23:00.746
<i>Overhead, sky dancers.</i>

23:00.852 --> 23:04.649
<i>You know, I want people to feel
like anything can happen here.</i>

23:14.708 --> 23:17.327
It's gonna be a magical night.

23:32.180 --> 23:35.147
- The hired dancers?
- Are doing their thing.

23:35.252 --> 23:38.121
- And Phillips?
- Is happy and is going up in five.

23:38.228 --> 23:39.984
Peggy, I've got it covered.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.123
See that you do, my dear.

23:46.003 --> 23:48.043
Oh, thank God.

23:48.148 --> 23:50.962
Thank you so much.
I owe you big time.

23:51.059 --> 23:53.961
So, which one is she?

23:54.068 --> 23:56.785
<i>Oh, she's the tall blonde one,
near the fortune-teller.</i>

23:56.883 --> 24:00.331
- Ah, very nice.
- Yeah, she's a little high-strung.

24:00.436 --> 24:02.410
<i>No problem.</i>

24:02.515 --> 24:04.620
It is gonna cost you extra.

24:04.724 --> 24:06.731
You're terrible. But a doll.

24:06.835 --> 24:08.657
Now go.
I have work to do.

24:08.755 --> 24:10.577
So do I.

24:14.515 --> 24:16.719
- [Man On Earpiece] Got another freeloader.
- What? No, no, no.

24:16.819 --> 24:19.753
If they're not on the list,
they cannot get in. No exceptions.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.128
- I'm on the list. "Plus one."
- [Chattering]

24:22.227 --> 24:24.648
I'm on the list.
It's the jacket!

24:24.755 --> 24:27.122
<i>- [Male Reporter] Hey, look this way!
- Ow! My foot!</i>

24:27.219 --> 24:30.253
- Sorry. They threw me.
- What a loser!

24:30.354 --> 24:33.453
- Of course I'm all right.
- [Grunts]

24:42.195 --> 24:44.616
Uh, mm, is this
the Masquerade bash?

- Are you Ronald?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

24:47.923 --> 24:50.094
- Th-That's me. Ronald.
- You're late.

24:50.195 --> 24:52.496
- Dancers change in Room 5.
- Okay. [Chuckles]

24:52.594 --> 24:54.667
So go on.

24:54.770 --> 24:57.039
Up to Room 5.
Hope these clothes fit.

25:01.938 --> 25:04.589
<i>[Woman]
Just as I thought. The Lovers.</i>

Oh, fantastic!

- Ashley!

25:09.170 --> 25:11.025
Antonio. Peggy.

25:11.123 --> 25:12.945
You two look like
you're hitting it off.

25:13.043 --> 25:15.912
Yes, we really are.
Thanks for hooking us up.

25:16.019 --> 25:18.702

25:21.970 --> 25:24.556
<i>Oh, my pleasure.
You two look made for each other.</i>

25:24.658 --> 25:26.698
That's what Madame Z just said.

25:26.802 --> 25:29.103
- Did she?
- The Lovers.

25:29.202 --> 25:32.551
Come on, baby.
Let's... dance.

25:32.658 --> 25:34.632
- Whoa.
- [Giggling]

25:34.738 --> 25:36.494
Keep up the good work, Z.

25:36.593 --> 25:40.074
You, come. Don't you want Madame Z
to tell you what's in the cards for you?

25:40.178 --> 25:43.691
- No, it's okay. Save it for the guests.
- Ah, a skeptic.

25:43.794 --> 25:47.339
No, it's just, how many times can you hear,
"You'll meet a handsome stranger"?

25:47.442 --> 25:49.581
Hello? It's called a Tuesday.
[Laughs]

25:49.681 --> 25:52.365
What? You think that
good fortune is normal?

25:52.465 --> 25:55.182
Just as I suspected.

25:55.282 --> 25:57.453
What? What'd it say?
Am I gonna win a cruise?

25:57.554 --> 25:59.888
'Cause lately I've been having
that cruise-winning feeling.

25:59.985 --> 26:05.036
Not exactly. It says that good luck
has always spun your way.

26:05.138 --> 26:07.342
<i>Uh-oh. Be careful.</i>

26:07.441 --> 26:11.053
This card, the Wheel of Fortune,
it is upside down.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.153
<i>That means the wheel
may be spinning back.</i>

26:14.257 --> 26:17.770
Right. Yeah. I don't really have time
for the whole spinning wheel thing.

26:17.873 --> 26:21.735
I have 500 guests and a broken
bubble cannon to attend to.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.158
- So go.
- Well, keep up the good work.
People are loving it, Z.

26:27.665 --> 26:30.054
Holy crap.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.695
Yeah! Yeah!

26:38.801 --> 26:42.096

26:54.833 --> 26:57.451
<i>I said do you like the music?</i>

26:57.553 --> 27:00.455
<i>Ain't nothin'like a Damon party!</i>

27:00.561 --> 27:03.692
And I want to thank you for comin' out
and supporting the Second Street Shelter.

27:08.112 --> 27:10.251
As of right now...

27:10.353 --> 27:15.109
we've raised $270,000!

27:15.217 --> 27:17.584
Give yourselves
a round of applause.

27:17.681 --> 27:22.088
<i>That's a lot of money!
It's not enough.</i>

27:22.192 --> 27:24.843
I promise you,
if you dig deep...

27:24.944 --> 27:28.719
<i>and show me some money,
I'll show you a good time.</i>

27:28.816 --> 27:31.685
- Music!
- [Cheering]

27:31.792 --> 27:34.639
Hit it! Come on! Oh!

27:34.736 --> 27:37.321
<i>Wha- Wha- Ooh, ooh!</i>

27:37.424 --> 27:40.293
Ooh, ooh!
Damn I'm good!

27:47.056 --> 27:50.252
- Where's the bubbly? Let's party, yo.
- Mr. Phillips? Excuse me!

28:05.872 --> 28:09.483
Hey. I'm gonna see you at church.
[Laughing]

28:09.583 --> 28:11.493
What's up, man?

28:19.824 --> 28:22.474
Hey, hey. The dancers are
supposed to be on the dance floor.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.997
- And the dance floor is that way.
- Uh, right. Sure.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.274
I just-

28:34.447 --> 28:39.084
I was just about to ask
this lovely lady to dance.

28:39.183 --> 28:42.249
- Oh!
- Oh, sucking up to the boss, huh?

28:42.351 --> 28:44.293
The bo- Sorry.

28:44.399 --> 28:46.668
You should go dance.
Go dance with him.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.288
<i>- Come on. You're earned it.
This party's amazing.
- He's kinda cute.</i>

28:49.391 --> 28:52.490
You know what? I will.
I deserve to have a little fun tonight.

28:52.591 --> 28:54.478
- Ooh. Bye!
- [Wolf Whistle]

28:54.575 --> 28:58.219
<i>Can I go dance? I wanna go dance.
Can I go dance?</i>

28:58.319 --> 29:00.970
- Please.
- Fine. Go, go, go. Play. Play.

29:02.990 --> 29:06.471
- [Woman] Hey, watch it, jerk!
- Sorry.

30:13.166 --> 30:16.265
- I'm sorry.
- No. No. Don't- Don't be sorry.

30:16.365 --> 30:18.373
L- I, uh-

30:18.477 --> 30:21.957
What? I can't hear you.
It's too loud in here. Let me step outside.

30:22.061 --> 30:25.192
- I have to go.
- What? Wait.

30:25.294 --> 30:29.123
Look, I have to take care of one thing,
but I promise I'll be right back.

30:29.230 --> 30:31.237
<i>- But-
- Just stay where you are. All right?</i>

30:31.342 --> 30:33.164
Okay.

30:36.654 --> 30:38.988
Ashley, who was that?

30:39.086 --> 30:41.868
Um, I honestly don't know.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.835
You were just kissing that guy
you honestly don't know?

30:44.942 --> 30:48.935
Yeah. Yeah. Oh!
[Gasps]

30:49.038 --> 30:51.688
- What?
- My shoe.

30:51.789 --> 30:55.750
<i>- [Cloth Tearing]
- Oh, my God.</i>

30:55.853 --> 30:57.992
- What?
- My dress.

30:58.093 --> 31:00.329
- My dress!
- At least you're wearing underwear.

31:04.493 --> 31:07.842
<i>That- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is the biggest party.</i>

31:07.949 --> 31:10.436
- Mr. Phillips? Excuse me.
- No, no, no, no.

31:10.541 --> 31:13.159
The big-This is the biggest party.
Yes, we're throwin'-

31:13.261 --> 31:16.010
- [Horn Honking]
- Right. Hey!

31:18.381 --> 31:23.170
- The kid! The kid!
- The guy cut me off! Somebody call 911!

31:23.277 --> 31:25.415
- Unbelievable!
- Are you all right?

31:25.517 --> 31:28.452
- Uh, uh. No. No, I'm okay.
- No, no, no.

31:28.556 --> 31:31.076
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.547
- Uh, no, really. I'm fine.
- Let me help you, man.

31:33.645 --> 31:37.801
- I'm not hurt. Mr. Phillips.
- You're the luckiest son of a gun I've ever seen!

31:39.468 --> 31:41.475
Mr. Phillips, you okay?
You all right?

31:41.581 --> 31:44.036
I'm better than okay, man.
I'm alive!

31:44.140 --> 31:47.239
- You saved my life, Spider-Man.
- It was nothing, really.

31:47.341 --> 31:49.315
There's gotta be a way
I can repay you.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.242
I'm just glad you're okay.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.162
There's gotta be something
I can do for you.

31:53.260 --> 31:57.667
Um, okay. You know what?
I don't want to put you out or anything...

31:57.772 --> 31:59.911
but this band is exactly
what you're looking for.

32:00.012 --> 32:02.696
- They're the hottest band in New York City.
- It's done.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.666
- If you just-What did you say?
- I said it's done.

32:05.772 --> 32:07.594
- You bring, um- McFly, right?
- Yeah.

32:07.692 --> 32:10.114
Bring McFly by the office,
and we'll have a listen.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.227
Okay.

32:12.332 --> 32:15.332
- Say, kid, what's your name?
- Jake. Jake Hardin.

32:15.436 --> 32:18.785
Jake Hardin, Damon Phillips
owes you big. [Chuckles]

32:18.892 --> 32:22.852
Yeah, I'm still here.
This kid saved my life, man.

32:24.620 --> 32:28.711
Is it me,
or did I just get lucky?

32:28.812 --> 32:32.838
She's choking! Breathe, Ashley!
Puke- Puke it up!

32:32.939 --> 32:34.881
<i>- Move it! Get out of my way!
- She's choking!</i>

32:34.988 --> 32:36.843
- Here! Let me help.
- She's red!

32:36.939 --> 32:39.907
<i>- Here.
- Somebody help-</i>

32:40.011 --> 32:42.084
<i>- One more time.
- [Grunts]</i>

32:44.236 --> 32:47.083
- What was that?
- An olive.

32:47.179 --> 32:49.318
Ash, Ash, look!

32:49.419 --> 32:53.794
- No, I did not! Not me!
- Is she getting arrested?

32:53.899 --> 32:55.906
- It's her! Her!
- Who?

32:56.012 --> 32:57.986
Are they pointing at me?
They're pointing at me.

32:58.091 --> 33:00.163
Come on.
Let's get her.

33:00.267 --> 33:02.471
Excuse me.

33:02.571 --> 33:04.840
- They're coming over here.
- Oh, okay.

33:04.939 --> 33:08.551
Move it! Move it!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

33:08.651 --> 33:11.520
- Ashley Albright?
- I'm afraid to say yes.

33:11.627 --> 33:13.634
You're under arrest.

33:13.739 --> 33:16.521
Is this about
Sarah Jessica Parker's dress?

33:16.619 --> 33:19.718
[Gasps] Wait. I mean, no-
I'm gonna give it back!

33:24.939 --> 33:27.394
Wait. I obey the law.
I like the law.

33:27.498 --> 33:31.011
<i>[Phillips] It's been a great night.
I almost got hit by a car.</i>

33:31.115 --> 33:32.937
- And I would-
- Step aside, sir.

33:33.035 --> 33:34.857
<i>[Phillips]
Hey, what the hell's going on?</i>

33:34.955 --> 33:36.777
<i>I mean, hello?
Sex and the City?</i>

33:36.875 --> 33:38.882
Sarah Jessica Parker
has so many dresses.

33:38.987 --> 33:41.092
That was so last season.
Is she really gonna miss it?

33:41.194 --> 33:43.365
You're a prostitute?

33:43.466 --> 33:45.670
An escort.
I thought you knew.

33:45.771 --> 33:48.673
I have never been so humiliated.

33:48.778 --> 33:51.528
- Peggy, l-
- Thanks to you and your little alcoves.

33:51.627 --> 33:54.441
"I want people to feel like
anything can happen here."

33:54.538 --> 33:56.643
Oh.

33:59.211 --> 34:03.750
- Oh. [Chuckles]
- What are you grinning about?

34:03.850 --> 34:06.534
- I know what's going on here.
- What?

34:06.634 --> 34:09.601
- Where do you think he is?
- Where do I think who is?

34:09.706 --> 34:11.429
Shh. The host.

34:11.530 --> 34:13.668
- The host of what?
- Of this reality show.

34:13.770 --> 34:15.942
Okay, I've figured it out.

34:16.042 --> 34:18.726
You guys can come out
and tell me that I've won now.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.281
- Are you insane?
- Hey, keep it down in there!

34:21.386 --> 34:23.655
Did David Pennington
put you up to this?

34:23.754 --> 34:26.786
<i>- Huh? Did he?
- That's my seat.</i>

34:26.889 --> 34:29.759
I thought this was festival seating.

34:29.866 --> 34:32.386
- Huh?
- This is real life, Ashley.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.562
You not only cost me
my biggest client...

34:34.666 --> 34:37.632
<i>but I can't even imagine what they're
gonna say about me in the Post.</i>

34:37.737 --> 34:39.679
- Braden.
- That's me.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.208
- You made bail.
- Oh, God, thank you.

34:42.313 --> 34:44.681
- Thank you.
- Peggy, I'm sorry.

34:44.777 --> 34:47.396
Oh, and in case
you haven't guessed...

34:47.496 --> 34:49.320
you're fired.

34:51.016 --> 34:53.603
<i>- [Clears Throat]
- [Guard] This way, ma'am.</i>

34:57.097 --> 35:00.326
- Is this your floor too?
- What did you say?

35:18.569 --> 35:20.511
All right. That's enough.

35:21.897 --> 35:25.028
<i>- Hey, guys.
- [Phillips] Car ready, Tiff?</i>

35:25.129 --> 35:28.129
You know, they're just-
They're...

35:29.481 --> 35:32.350
- a little nervous.
- Mm, go with 'em.

35:32.457 --> 35:35.490
<i>Jake? Jake?</i>

35:37.800 --> 35:41.378
- I'm sorry if that wasn't
exactly what you're look-
- What do you like about 'em?

35:41.481 --> 35:44.896
They have a fresh take on retro,
like early Beatles meets Blink 182.

35:45.001 --> 35:47.619
I'm surprised you don't talk
about record sales and demographics.

35:47.721 --> 35:49.892
Well, it's funny you
should say that, actually.

35:49.992 --> 35:52.578
I think a band that's good
will sell itself.

35:52.681 --> 35:55.015
- An idealist and a purist. I like that.
- Yeah.

35:55.113 --> 35:58.790
I used to be like that once,
but then I decided to become filthy rich.

35:58.888 --> 36:02.117
Uh, okay, well, thanks-
thanks for the opportunity.

36:02.216 --> 36:05.315
Look, kid, I believe in luck.

36:05.416 --> 36:08.613
So I'm gonna send it out to a couple
radio stations, see how it plays.

36:08.713 --> 36:12.062
Meanwhile, you guys work on
a follow-up, okay? You got two weeks.

36:12.168 --> 36:15.234
<i>- So, you're signing the band?
- [Groans]</i>

36:15.336 --> 36:18.816
I spent eight minutes with you. Why would I
waste that time if I wasn't signing the band?

36:18.921 --> 36:22.783
Tiffany, call accounting and cut them an
advance check and put them up in a penthouse.

36:22.888 --> 36:26.466
<i>- Okay.
- Now it's been nine minutes. Let's go.</i>

36:26.568 --> 36:28.542
All right. Bye.

36:28.648 --> 36:30.470
<i>Thanks. Thank you!</i>

36:34.696 --> 36:36.932
Congratulations.

36:38.504 --> 36:40.326
Thanks.

36:54.311 --> 36:57.279
[Screams]
Oh! Oh, my God!

37:08.519 --> 37:11.585
[Sighs]
Home.

37:11.687 --> 37:13.662
Good morning.

37:13.767 --> 37:16.451
Oh.
[Sniffs]

37:19.048 --> 37:21.568
Do I need a bubble bath.

37:23.431 --> 37:26.082
Hey. Whoa. Isn't that my-

37:26.183 --> 37:30.111
We've gone through pretty much
everything. It's all rated PG-1.

37:30.215 --> 37:34.208
- That's right. We're gonna
have to clear it all out.
- What? Oh, my goodness.

37:34.311 --> 37:37.507
- This your apartment?
- Yes. Um, what happened?

37:37.607 --> 37:39.647
- Flood.
- Flood?

37:39.751 --> 37:44.061
Yeah, it's a, uh, technical term
for a lot of water where it shouldn't be.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.403
It's no big deal though.
We'll take care of it.

37:46.503 --> 37:50.758
<i>- Oh, thank you. Do you mind
if I go in and change now?
- Hey, hey, fellas!</i>

37:50.855 --> 37:53.244
She wants to come in
and change her clothes.

37:53.351 --> 37:55.718
- [All Laughing]
- I don't get it. Why are you laughing?

37:55.815 --> 37:58.717
Sweetheart, we got
a grade-four mold infestation.

37:58.822 --> 38:02.684
- You're lucky we found it.
- Lucky. Yeah.

38:03.974 --> 38:05.796
Oh!

38:05.894 --> 38:08.382
- Move it out!
- Easy!

38:08.486 --> 38:11.869
- Do you have my furniture?
- Don't worry about that.

38:11.974 --> 38:15.520
- Oh.
- We'll burn it before it can
contaminate anyone else.

38:15.623 --> 38:18.622
<i>We did manage to save these.</i>

38:20.966 --> 38:23.584
- This is it?
- That's it.

38:27.526 --> 38:30.079
<i>[Man] Check with the I.C.
We're gonna need another hose.</i>

38:30.182 --> 38:33.598
<i>[Man #2] We're on it already.
We're gonna do a reverse hose lay.</i>

38:43.814 --> 38:46.749
Hey, you.
Are you okay?

38:51.334 --> 38:56.036
- This is my new apartment?
- I know. It's pretty amazing.

38:56.134 --> 38:59.232
Home theater, satellite TV.

38:59.334 --> 39:02.203
<i>And at night,
with the lights down low...</i>

39:02.310 --> 39:06.139
let's just say this place
is pretty mind-blowing.

39:06.246 --> 39:09.923
Uh, yeah, it's pre- it's pretty mind-
you know, in broad daylight.

39:10.021 --> 39:13.796
Well, the band is down the hall.
The bar and the fridge are fully stocked.

39:13.893 --> 39:17.984
Oh, and just so you know,
D.M.R. Is a really nice place to work.

39:18.086 --> 39:21.566
<i>You know, like at some companies they
don't allow employees to date each other?</i>

39:21.670 --> 39:23.492
Here they do.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.728
Date?

39:25.829 --> 39:28.611
That'd be great!
I'm free all weekend.

39:28.709 --> 39:31.392
Hey, you don't mind
if the girl pays, do ya?

39:31.493 --> 39:33.915
Some guys have
this weird hang-up.

39:34.021 --> 39:36.956
Ooh, gotta split. I'm late
for my erotic massage class.

39:37.061 --> 39:40.290
<i>Catch you later, Spider-Man.</i>

39:42.565 --> 39:44.769
Erotic massage.

39:48.229 --> 39:52.506
<i>Guys, thank you for letting me stay here.
Not only don't I have money...</i>

39:52.613 --> 39:55.809
but the dragon lady's blackballed me
from every firm in the city.

39:55.909 --> 39:59.521
- Well, why don't you phone your parents?
- And admit defeat? No way.

39:59.620 --> 40:03.330
- Yeah.
- So, where should I sleep?

40:03.429 --> 40:06.047
- In your room.
- My room?

40:06.148 --> 40:08.767
Mm-hmm. See, Maggie's room
is right here above the kitchen.

40:08.868 --> 40:12.163
Thanks. And Dana's
is a Jennifer Convertible.

40:12.260 --> 40:15.424
Yeah, so your options
are the La-Z-Boy.

40:15.525 --> 40:17.729
- Mm.
- Soft and sturdy.

40:17.828 --> 40:20.862
And my personal favorite,
the fabulous futon.

40:20.964 --> 40:23.037
- Hmm?
- Perfect.

40:23.140 --> 40:26.555
<i>Well, I'll keep out of your way,
and you guys won't even know I'm here.</i>

40:26.660 --> 40:29.278
- Blow-dryer?
- Oh, yeah. On top of the radiator.

40:29.380 --> 40:32.195
Thanks.
[Sighs]

40:32.292 --> 40:35.424
<i>- [Mews]
- I never noticed. Is your cat all black?</i>

40:35.524 --> 40:38.394
- Yeah. Why?
- Just curious.

40:39.748 --> 40:42.595
Well, this is nice.
We'll have fun.

40:42.692 --> 40:46.751
Everything's gonna be-
Oh, my God!

40:46.852 --> 40:49.470
- What?
- I have a zit.

40:49.572 --> 40:52.507
<i>I have a zit!
Girls, I have a zit!</i>

40:55.748 --> 40:58.563
- [Gasps]
- Ash, are you okay in there?

40:58.660 --> 41:01.475
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, wow!

41:01.571 --> 41:04.605
- Ashley!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

41:09.124 --> 41:11.360
<i>[Dana Gasps]
Ash!</i>

41:11.460 --> 41:14.559
<i>- [Man] Okay, who's the idiot?
- [Woman] Nice work!</i>

41:14.659 --> 41:20.061
Ash? Are you okay, Ash?
Hold tight. Hold on. Sweetie?

41:20.163 --> 41:22.749
<i>I broke a mirror.
I broke a mirror. I know.</i>

41:22.851 --> 41:26.332
- Ah.
- I mean, guys, what is going on with me?

41:26.435 --> 41:28.639
You know, I can't take
seven more years of this.

41:28.740 --> 41:31.423
<i>Ever since this masquerade bash,
it's like I'm the anti-Midas...</i>

41:31.524 --> 41:33.728
and everything I touch
turns to crap.

41:33.827 --> 41:36.129
Okay, Ashley,
calm down, all right?

41:36.227 --> 41:39.194
For some reason, the fates
have dealt you a lousy hand.

41:39.300 --> 41:42.234
- [Scoffs]
- But the wheel always spins back.

41:42.339 --> 41:45.405
<i>- Right?
- [Siren Wailing]</i>

41:50.243 --> 41:52.283
- [Sighs]
- You're fired.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.629
Oh, my God. I need
to borrow some clothes.

42:11.459 --> 42:14.361
Hello! Open up!

42:14.467 --> 42:16.540
- Hello!
- Yoo-hoo.

42:16.643 --> 42:19.490
- Yes?
- You have ruined my life!

42:19.586 --> 42:21.408
What? Ugh, it's you.

42:21.506 --> 42:23.743
Everything in my life was
perfect until you came around.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.974
<i>Wait a minute.
Was it really perfect?</i>

42:27.074 --> 42:30.423
- You know what?
Don't you psychoanalyze me!
- Whoa.

42:30.531 --> 42:33.913
Okay, just work your voodoo
magic and give me my luck back.

42:34.019 --> 42:37.913
Fine. Concentrate.
[Grunting]

42:38.018 --> 42:41.149
- Gosh.
- [Shouts In Russian]

42:41.250 --> 42:44.828
All right? It's back.
Now, please, go home.

42:44.931 --> 42:46.753
- I got an early day tomorrow.
- No, no.

42:46.850 --> 42:50.047
Do not patronize me, okay?
You and your cards screwed everything up!

42:50.146 --> 42:51.968
Now you have to fix it.

42:52.066 --> 42:54.935
I tried to warn you,
sweetheart.

42:55.042 --> 42:57.312
Look, did anything unusual
happen at that party?

42:57.410 --> 43:01.120
[Laughs] Well, besides the fact
that I tore my dress...

43:01.218 --> 43:05.080
<i>nearly choked to death
and the felony charges, no.</i>

43:05.186 --> 43:08.699
Yikes.
How about before that?

43:08.802 --> 43:11.868
Well, I mean, I kissed a cute guy,
but that's hardly unusual.

43:14.946 --> 43:18.688
Wait a second. You said that I could
lose it to someone else, right?

43:18.786 --> 43:21.404
So does that mean that
he took my luck from me?

43:21.506 --> 43:24.223
Maybe he needed it
more than you.

43:24.322 --> 43:28.282
So he stole it? That little
whack-kissing bandit!

43:28.386 --> 43:31.069
<i>No, that is just my luck, okay?</i>

43:31.169 --> 43:33.951
And you're gonna help me
and tell me how to get it back.

43:34.049 --> 43:36.154
Me?

43:36.258 --> 43:39.007
Well, let's see. Uh-

43:39.105 --> 43:42.421
If he took it from you with a kiss...

43:44.129 --> 43:46.584
then it stands to reason-

43:47.745 --> 43:49.654
What?

43:52.449 --> 43:55.351
<i>So wait. We're talking
20 professional dancers?</i>

43:55.457 --> 43:58.457
One of these guys' lips are the key
to getting my life back, guys.

43:58.561 --> 44:00.383
- I don't believe it.
- Whoa!

44:00.481 --> 44:02.619
- Hey, get off the sidewalk!
- Take it eas'!

44:02.721 --> 44:04.925
- What am I, a target?
- See, it's ridiculous, right?

44:05.025 --> 44:07.294
You can't get your luck back
by kissing a guy.

44:07.393 --> 44:09.498
I don't believe
how hot these guys are.

44:09.601 --> 44:11.576
Oh, great!
Now you're encouraging her?

44:11.681 --> 44:13.656
Oh, no. I'm just here
to observe and mock.

44:13.761 --> 44:16.282
Guys, I'm just trying to get my life
the way it was again.

44:16.385 --> 44:19.102
Okay, how are you even
gonna know if you kissed the right guy?

44:19.201 --> 44:21.023
Oh, I've got a foolproof test.

44:21.121 --> 44:25.082
<i>- [Bell Chiming]
- Oh! Hey, hey, that's him!</i>

44:26.465 --> 44:28.636
Oh, yeah.

44:28.736 --> 44:31.071
All right!

44:34.049 --> 44:37.464
[Gasps] Oh, my God!
It's definitely him.

44:37.568 --> 44:40.056
<i>Oh, my gosh!
Ashley, he's married!</i>

44:40.160 --> 44:41.983
Ashley!

44:46.368 --> 44:49.565
<i>- Michael!

44:54.208 --> 44:56.826
- I suppose that's your sister?
- No, no, muffin, muffin!

44:56.928 --> 44:59.743
- Tomato. Sorry.
- [Arguing]

44:59.841 --> 45:02.207
You ruined my wedding!

45:10.272 --> 45:12.159
Ooh, yeah.

45:19.647 --> 45:22.397
Okay, push, push, push!

45:22.496 --> 45:25.114
- Excuse me. This'll just be a minute.
- Come on.

45:40.448 --> 45:42.270
Sorry.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.298
Here. Here.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.236
- [Groans]
- Thanks anyway. It's all right.

45:54.175 --> 45:57.274
- Oh, Dana?
- Hmm? What?

46:00.191 --> 46:03.126
Thank you so much.
Feel better.

46:05.407 --> 46:08.277
Please, please, please, please.

46:08.383 --> 46:10.205
Why?

46:28.095 --> 46:30.713
Hi. I'm Dave.

46:36.063 --> 46:38.484
Hey, Lance.
Can you hear me?

46:38.591 --> 46:41.438
Hi. How are you?

46:41.535 --> 46:43.258
Um, okay, here goes.

46:44.702 --> 46:46.525
Oh! Ow!

46:49.246 --> 46:51.418
Girls.

46:54.175 --> 46:56.215
He bit my tongue.

46:59.839 --> 47:02.522
Here.

47:04.606 --> 47:07.388
Oh, come on. Oh.

47:07.486 --> 47:09.657
Ooh! We still have one left.

47:09.758 --> 47:11.514
<i>- Tom Guthrie.
- [Dana] Spit out the ice, Ash.</i>

47:11.614 --> 47:13.948
- Mm.
- Tom Guthrie.

47:14.046 --> 47:16.533
We've looked for him at, like,
three different addresses already.

47:16.638 --> 47:18.460
Yeah.
You know, you're right.

47:18.558 --> 47:21.657
I'm like the rest of the rabbit
after they cut off its lucky foot.

47:21.758 --> 47:25.107
- I should just give up.
- Come on, Ash. It's not that bad.

47:25.214 --> 47:27.897
Yeah, so you've kissed
a dozen bacteria-ridden strangers.

47:27.998 --> 47:31.314
- You know, you still got your friends.
- Oh, thanks.

47:31.421 --> 47:33.756
But it's probably best
that we no longer touch.

47:33.854 --> 47:35.676
- [Scoffs]
- But I love you.

47:35.773 --> 47:38.294
Oh, you love me?
I'm gonna get you.

47:38.397 --> 47:40.220
<i>- I'm gonna kiss you.

47:44.253 --> 47:46.457
## [Hums]
[Gasps] Pancakes!

47:46.558 --> 47:48.216
- Hi, kitty.
- [Beeps]

47:48.318 --> 47:50.140
- Hey, Ash. It's me, David.
- [Gasps]

47:50.238 --> 47:52.343
Uh, big art opening tonight
at Station "A" Gallery.

47:52.445 --> 47:55.063
<i>- David Pennington!
- Meet you there at 7:00? Don't break my heart.</i>

47:55.165 --> 47:57.554
<i>- [Beeps]
- David Pennington. Another date.</i>

47:57.661 --> 48:00.793
- I'm not going.
- Why not? It's a chance with a great guy.

48:00.893 --> 48:04.308
No. It's a chance
to get hit by a bus. Maggie...

48:04.413 --> 48:06.235
your black cat
is crossing my path.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.220
Not good.

48:08.317 --> 48:12.660
Come on, Pancakes. Don't be scared
of the superstitious, mean lady.

48:12.765 --> 48:15.994
I'm not superstitious, but it's true.
I mean, it's bad luck.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.035
[Sighs]
Dane, how's my scope?

48:18.141 --> 48:20.989
Leo. Leo.

48:21.085 --> 48:24.314
- "Your moon is in Uranus."
- Ooh.

48:24.413 --> 48:26.039
Doesn't sound pretty.

48:26.141 --> 48:29.272
He could have canceled.
Isn't that proof enough...

48:29.373 --> 48:31.315
<i>that this whole bad luck thing
is totally bogus?</i>

48:31.421 --> 48:33.243
[Chuckles]
I don't think so.

48:33.341 --> 48:36.308
Ashley, unlucky girls...

48:36.413 --> 48:40.341
<i>don't get asked out by one of Us Weekly's
most eligible bachelors.</i>

48:40.444 --> 48:43.674
Unlucky girls sit and watch their
more fortunate friends get asked out...

48:43.772 --> 48:47.067
<i>while they sit at home and watch Oprah
and eat last year's Halloween candy.</i>

48:47.164 --> 48:49.815
- That's true.
- You're right.

48:49.917 --> 48:53.146
Of course I'm right.
Go get ready.

48:53.245 --> 48:55.067
[Sighs]
You know what?

48:55.165 --> 48:58.394
Maybe I'm not cursed. You know,
I'm just looking at things the wrong way.

48:58.492 --> 49:00.347
And these setbacks
could just be opportunities.

49:00.444 --> 49:02.233
- Of course.
- Exactly.

49:02.332 --> 49:05.464
- Because when one door closes-
- Two others open.

49:05.564 --> 49:08.859
Okay. I'm turning over a new leaf,
and my good luck starts now.

49:08.956 --> 49:09.905
Good.

49:14.620 --> 49:15.700
It's okay.

49:23.804 --> 49:25.626
Oh-

49:27.132 --> 49:29.270
Did you just put that
back in your eye?

49:29.372 --> 49:32.787
- It was my last one, guys.
- That's really gross.

49:32.892 --> 49:34.069
Ow! My eye!

49:39.356 --> 49:41.559
But, you see,
l- I'm on the list. I'm "plus one."

49:41.660 --> 49:43.067
David Pennington, plus one.

49:46.652 --> 49:49.434
- Hi, David.
- There he is. See? There he is.

49:50.844 --> 49:53.462
- Oh, hey.
- David Pennington. There.

49:53.564 --> 49:56.182
No, no, no. There.
She's- She's with me.

49:56.283 --> 49:58.618
Thank you. Oh!

49:58.715 --> 50:00.690
Ooh.

50:00.796 --> 50:03.479
I'm okay. Fine.

50:03.580 --> 50:06.394
Come on.
I got a surprise for you.

50:10.075 --> 50:11.984
Oh, my God.

50:12.091 --> 50:14.938
<i>Would you look at that big, ugly...</i>

50:15.035 --> 50:16.857
- brown pile of-
- Uh, Ashley-

50:16.955 --> 50:20.184
It looked like it came out of the rear end
of an elephant. [Groans]

50:20.283 --> 50:22.388
- Ashley.
- Huh?

50:22.492 --> 50:25.558
Uh- [Clears Throat]
Meet my mother, the artist.

50:25.659 --> 50:28.114
- Hmm.
- The artist.

50:28.219 --> 50:30.936
Hi, Mrs. Pennington.

50:31.036 --> 50:33.905
You know, you look
so much younger in person.

50:34.011 --> 50:36.630
Not that I mean
you're old or anything.

50:36.731 --> 50:39.731
David, if I'm going to listen to this,
I'll need vodka.

50:39.835 --> 50:41.657
Good idea.

50:41.755 --> 50:43.249
<i>- Waiter.
- [Man] Yes, sir.</i>

50:46.715 --> 50:49.104
Sure. Hmm?

No, thank you.

<i>David, darling, that awful man

- That son of a-
- Excuse me.

50:59.738 --> 51:02.902
Yeah? Oh, um, the waiter.
He was just-

51:03.003 --> 51:05.818
- More your type? I totally agree.
- Wha-

51:05.914 --> 51:10.257
- Mother, please.
- Um, if you two don't mind,
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.

51:14.331 --> 51:16.786
You! Finally.

51:16.890 --> 51:19.825
- Excuse me?
- You're gonna keep your tongue
in your mouth at all times...

51:19.931 --> 51:22.418
- 'cause this is strictly business.
- What?

51:22.522 --> 51:24.496
- Give me back my luck. Come here.
- What the-

51:24.602 --> 51:26.293

No, he's not.
It's a cardiac reflex thing.

51:56.633 --> 52:00.278

- [Muffled] I can't breathe.

52:06.874 --> 52:09.623
He's gonna be okay.

maybe I'm not even here right now.

<i>This is all probably
a- a dream that I'm having...</i>

<i>That looks good.
Are you done with that?</i>

54:05.367 --> 54:07.855
No. That was a joke.

Oh, not the salt.

54:31.607 --> 54:33.942
Just so everyone knows...

54:34.039 --> 54:37.901
<i>I think what I'm about to do is completely
ridiculous, but it can't hurt, can it?</i>

54:38.007 --> 54:39.829
<i>Come on.</i>

54:39.927 --> 54:41.967
- [Screaming] My eye!
- Oh, my God!

54:42.071 --> 54:44.526
Oh! Oh, my-

54:44.631 --> 54:47.631
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Miss, I think it's, uh...

54:47.735 --> 54:49.590
<i>- time to go now.
- Oh, my God. All right.</i>

54:49.687 --> 54:52.338
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

54:54.359 --> 54:58.004
<i>- I think we're clear.
- Thanks for that. Sorry.</i>

54:58.103 --> 55:00.973
- I couldn't help but overhear your, uh-
- Oh, meltdown?

55:01.079 --> 55:04.625
<i>- [Chuckles]
- Yeah. Broke. Jobless.
And I just ate lejambon d'étranger.</i>

55:04.727 --> 55:07.411
- What?
- A stranger's bacon. I thought
it would sound better in French.

55:07.511 --> 55:09.900
- Oh.
- Guess not.

55:10.007 --> 55:13.422
You looked a little hungry. I thought you
could use this. Turkey on rye, extra mustard.

55:13.526 --> 55:15.981
Oh. Yes. Thank you.

55:16.087 --> 55:19.796
- Thanks. Um, nice to meet you.
- Okay. Yeah.

55:19.894 --> 55:21.782
I'm gonna-

55:28.119 --> 55:30.737
Look. I know of a job-
if you're looking for one.

55:30.839 --> 55:32.693
[Chuckles]
Really? What's the scam?

55:32.790 --> 55:35.725
- No scam.
- Well, do you want me to
join your religion or something?

55:35.830 --> 55:38.896
[Chuckles]
No. No religion stuff.

55:38.998 --> 55:42.064
It's just a job. You know, a bad job.
Crummy pay for crummy hours.

55:42.167 --> 55:44.501
That still doesn't answer
my question. What's the scam?

55:44.598 --> 55:47.565
Let's just say I know
what it's like to be S.O.L.

55:47.671 --> 55:51.053
- S.O. L?
- "Shit out of luck."

55:51.159 --> 55:54.868
What makes you think I'm S.O. L?
Just because I spilt the salt back there?

55:54.966 --> 55:56.493
Yeah.

55:56.598 --> 55:58.737
Oh!

55:59.926 --> 56:02.861
Look. Where you are right now,
I've been there.

56:02.966 --> 56:05.813
Been there? I lived there.
I was kind of the mayor of there.

56:08.118 --> 56:09.776
I'm Jake.

56:09.878 --> 56:12.016
Ashley.

56:12.118 --> 56:14.005
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, yeah. No, you got it.

56:14.102 --> 56:15.957
- Oh, my gosh.
- Looks great on you.

56:16.054 --> 56:18.737
Can anything else-
I mean, to be honest...

56:18.838 --> 56:21.259
I'm not really dressed for
a job interview right now.

56:21.366 --> 56:23.089
For this one
I think you'll be fine.

56:23.190 --> 56:25.077
- Okay.
- Wanna check it out?

56:25.173 --> 56:28.108
- Why are you so nice?
- Why-Just- Look. I mean...

56:28.213 --> 56:30.766
shit out of luck-
That's my thing.

56:30.870 --> 56:32.812
...put me in this position.
- You're gonna love her.

56:32.917 --> 56:34.805
- This is not fair. Listen.
- She's great.

56:34.902 --> 56:38.163
- I don't need another loser waitress here.
- Okay, Mac. Okay.

56:38.261 --> 56:41.196
- You won't be sorry.
- [Sighs]

56:41.301 --> 56:44.847
- I didn't get it.
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no. It's not that.

56:44.949 --> 56:47.819
You can have the job,
but it's my old job.

56:47.925 --> 56:49.649
So?

56:49.749 --> 56:52.913
Well, see, l- I'd hoped he would hire you
as a waitress or something.

56:53.013 --> 56:57.868
My old gig was kind of a- like a janitor,
food delivery person, toilet attendant.

56:59.605 --> 57:01.427
I'll take it. I'll take it.

57:16.725 --> 57:19.180
Whoa! God!

57:19.284 --> 57:21.423
Whoa! Whoa!

57:22.676 --> 57:25.808
Whoa. Oh!

57:29.557 --> 57:31.345
Oh!

57:31.445 --> 57:32.852
God.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.542
Oh! Oh!

57:43.092 --> 57:44.914
Oh!

57:57.621 --> 57:58.995
Oh!

58:11.412 --> 58:14.446
Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh!

58:21.108 --> 58:23.017
Oh.

58:37.043 --> 58:38.767
Oh! Oh!

58:38.867 --> 58:41.715
Oh!

58:41.812 --> 58:44.364
What the-

58:48.052 --> 58:50.637
I'll clean that up.

58:59.091 --> 59:02.506
[Muffled] Come on, boys.
Move it or lose it. Let's go.

59:12.083 --> 59:13.938
There we go.

59:20.595 --> 59:23.726
<i>Before Phillips will release the album,
he wants to see you play a larger space...</i>

59:23.827 --> 59:25.650
- like the Knitting Factory.
- [All] Oh!

59:25.747 --> 59:28.398
See if you can hold a big crowd
for an hour, create some preheat. Huh?

59:28.499 --> 59:30.637
- Yeah! When?
- I don't know.

59:30.739 --> 59:34.187
<i>- Guys! Listen. Carley, turn the radio up.
- ##[Radio: Rock]</i>

59:34.290 --> 59:36.527
- No way!
- That's it! That's it!

59:39.123 --> 59:41.163
Let's celebrate.
Burgers and fries on me.

59:41.266 --> 59:42.728
[All]
All right.

59:42.834 --> 59:47.057
Hey, sweetie. You, uh, scamper up
that ladder and- and fix that light.

59:47.155 --> 59:49.576
- Well, I'm not so good with-
- Thanks.

59:49.683 --> 59:51.505
Heights.

59:51.603 --> 59:53.970
<i>[Radio: Man] That's McFly,
a new British invasion band-</i>

59:54.066 --> 59:58.442
Phillips will tell us tonight. In the meantime,
we have to focus on fine-tuning-

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:02.763
Whoa.

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:04.972
Track-
See, that's not good.

01:00:06.546 --> 01:00:08.783
<i>She should have gone up
without the bulb...</i>

01:00:08.882 --> 01:00:11.338
then brought down the old one,
because now she's gonna be juggling-

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.410
Eh! Hey!

01:00:14.514 --> 01:00:16.935
- You know where the broom is.
- Yeah. I'll-

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:24.043
And she should have turned off the light
first because now she's gonna be-

01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:27.562
Electrocuted.

01:00:29.906 --> 01:00:31.728
- [Panting] Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:00:31.826 --> 01:00:33.648
Hi.

01:00:33.746 --> 01:00:37.062
So, other than, uh, you know,
getting zapped, how's the job working out?

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:38.992
<i>- Oh, I can't complain.
- That's good.</i>

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.603
No. I mean I'm literally not allowed
to complain. I had to sign something.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.615
Oh. I remember that.

01:00:44.721 --> 01:00:48.038
- This is cold, so it'll help.
- You're very handy with this stuff.

01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:51.179
- Thanks.
- Ah, that feels good.

01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:58.988
- Is that toothpaste?
- Yeah. It's an ancient Chinese
remedy for burned fingers.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:02.057
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah. It pays to be prepared.

01:01:02.161 --> 01:01:03.983
I've got everything in this backpack.

01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:06.415
I have first aid, extra socks.

01:01:06.513 --> 01:01:09.830
- Isn't that a bit defeatist?
- No, it's being a realist. You've been out there.

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:12.141
[Chuckles]
Hey. Let me see your cell phone.

01:01:12.241 --> 01:01:14.064
Why?

01:01:14.161 --> 01:01:17.544
- What the-What is this?
- Oh. Flip it like that.

01:01:17.649 --> 01:01:19.472
Like that.

01:01:19.569 --> 01:01:21.609
Address book.

01:01:21.713 --> 01:01:23.600
"Bergdorf's, Bendel's and sushi."

01:01:23.697 --> 01:01:27.788
Are you nuts?
Unlucky people need hospitals.

01:01:27.889 --> 01:01:30.311
<i>Also, never call 911.
They take forever.</i>

01:01:30.417 --> 01:01:32.905
Fire responds. They're great.

01:01:33.009 --> 01:01:35.376
National Poison Control Center.
Ask for Lou. He's very good.

01:01:40.145 --> 01:01:42.567
You know what? Um...

01:01:44.049 --> 01:01:46.350
this backpack has seen me through
just about everything.

01:01:46.449 --> 01:01:47.823
<i>And...</i>

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:50.190
I think it's time to pass it on.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:53.737
- Oh. No, no, no. I couldn't.
- No. No. Honestly, I think you should have it.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.524
- Please. You need it more than I do.
- Thank you.

01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:04.623
Uh, I better take this.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.455
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
- Hey, Katy. How's my girl? What?

01:02:09.552 --> 01:02:12.367
Your key? You checked the doormat?
[Chuckles]

01:02:12.465 --> 01:02:16.174
Um, okay. What-What if I pick you up,
take you to the new place?

01:02:16.272 --> 01:02:18.443
Yeah. You'll love it.
It's huge.

01:02:18.545 --> 01:02:21.000
<i>Okay. We'll have pizza.
It'll be fun.</i>

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:24.683
- I gotta run.
- Okay. Uh, yeah.

01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:28.461
<i>See ya, Ashley. Uh, it's just a-
It's a girl. Yeah. No.</i>

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.494
- Hey. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on.
- ## [Stops]

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.283
- Hey, guys. Sounds good.
- How you doing? Thank you.

01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:05.231
- What's going on?
- Look, Jake. The Knitting Factory fell through.

01:03:05.328 --> 01:03:07.467
- What?
- Oh, you're joking.

01:03:07.567 --> 01:03:10.699
- That sucks.
- But "Five Colours" has been
gettin' great radio play...

01:03:10.799 --> 01:03:15.054
<i>so I decided to book our boys
at the new Hard Rock Cafe Times Square.</i>

01:03:15.151 --> 01:03:16.613
No way!

01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:19.370
<i>- Who's your boy, huh? This is big!
- Beauty!</i>

01:03:19.472 --> 01:03:23.246

01:03:23.343 --> 01:03:25.416
We're-We're working on it.

01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:28.487
- Uh-
- All right. That's good. Don't let me stop you.

01:03:28.591 --> 01:03:31.690
- Sounds good, guys. Congratulations.
- All right. Have a good one.

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:35.850
So, um, Jake, when are we gonna
hear this amazing follow-up?

01:03:35.951 --> 01:03:38.885
- When you guys write it.
- Right.

01:03:40.047 --> 01:03:42.119
Hey, Jake.
You got a delivery.

01:03:43.503 --> 01:03:45.161
Over there.

01:03:45.263 --> 01:03:47.684
<i>[Man] Hey. Isn't that that bird
from the bowling alley?</i>

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:50.125
<i>- [Man #2] Yeah. The electrocuted one.
- [Man #3] Hey, Jakey.</i>

01:03:50.223 --> 01:03:52.557
Danny, let's work on your vocals
for "Too Close for Comfort."

01:03:52.655 --> 01:03:55.524
I think we're on the right track.
Just tighten it up a little bit.

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:58.119
Okay. We're-We're gonna take it
from the second verse.

01:04:01.007 --> 01:04:02.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:02.927 --> 01:04:05.316
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:08.554
- Thanks. Oh!
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:04:11.022 --> 01:04:13.892
- I'm- I'm sorry about-
- No. Don't worry about it.

01:04:13.998 --> 01:04:15.973
Come on in.
Check out this song.

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:21.034
Sounds great, Tim.

01:04:24.622 --> 01:04:26.891
- They sound good.
- Yeah. Yeah. They do, don't they?

01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.707
- Yeah.
- So, did you hear we're playing
the new Hard Rock?

01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:32.840
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah. Well, besides the fact
that it's a huge space...

01:04:32.943 --> 01:04:34.983
I'm probably not gonna
be able to fill it...

01:04:35.086 --> 01:04:37.737
- and I'm kind of dead.
- It's tough, but not impossible.

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:51.204
So, you think maybe, uh,
you'd want to go to coffee later...

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:53.677
or something maybe?

01:04:53.774 --> 01:04:56.840
Yeah, um- [Clears Throat]
That'd be nice.

01:05:02.478 --> 01:05:04.779
Oh. There she is.

01:05:08.269 --> 01:05:10.920
- Oh. Is- Is that Katy?
- Yeah. [Chuckles]

01:05:11.022 --> 01:05:13.258
She's cute, huh?
She picked out this jacket.

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:15.878
- Oh. Nice.
- Yeah.

01:05:18.062 --> 01:05:20.134
- Looks like a tramp.
- What?

01:05:20.237 --> 01:05:24.165
What? Camp. Camp. She looks
like someone I went to camp with.

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.092
- Yeah.
- Strange.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:28.012
Weird.

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:31.557
You know, l- I better get going.
Uh, Mac wants me to reset the rat trap.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.483
So, should I call you tonight?

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:36.134
Um, yeah, about that-
Oh, geez.

01:05:36.237 --> 01:05:39.849
Um, yeah. Some other time maybe.
I have other plans.

01:05:39.949 --> 01:05:42.982
<i>- If that's cool. Sorry about that again.
- That's okay.</i>

01:05:43.085 --> 01:05:44.907
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:51.622
Oh!

01:06:02.732 --> 01:06:05.154
- Thanks for the ride, Jake.
- Yeah. Hold up one second.

01:06:06.989 --> 01:06:08.876
Um, so I'll see you later?

01:06:08.973 --> 01:06:12.137
Tell Aunt Martha I'm gonna send
Bernie with the car to pick you up.
Don't forget your homework.

01:06:12.236 --> 01:06:14.757
- Yeah, yeah. I hear ya. Later.
- All right. See ya.

01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:24.803
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

01:06:24.908 --> 01:06:27.494
Don't open the umbrella.
Not inside.

01:06:27.596 --> 01:06:29.090
Very unlucky.

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:40.836
Oh! Oh!
[Yelps]

01:06:45.964 --> 01:06:47.874
<i>- Bernie.
- Yes, sir?</i>

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.369
Back it up, will ya?

01:06:57.068 --> 01:06:58.955
Oh, God.

01:07:03.564 --> 01:07:05.702
You know, there's a poncho
in that backpack.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.540
I didn't even think to- to look.

01:07:09.644 --> 01:07:11.684
Can I give you a ride?

01:07:11.788 --> 01:07:14.723
I only live 29 blocks from here.

01:07:15.787 --> 01:07:18.122
Uh, at least take my umbrella.

01:07:18.219 --> 01:07:20.608
I already have one.

01:07:20.716 --> 01:07:23.782
You know,
I got a washer-dryer, uh...

01:07:23.883 --> 01:07:27.145
microwave popcorn,
satellite TV.

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:30.539
No. L- l-
I really shouldn't.

01:07:30.636 --> 01:07:33.898
Look. I don't do this
for just anybody, but...

01:07:33.995 --> 01:07:37.257
I'll even throw in some hot chocolate
with those little tiny marshmallows.

01:07:40.492 --> 01:07:42.379
I love the tiny marshmallows.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.762
How about you toss
the lightning rod and get in?

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.747
Oh.

01:07:50.635 --> 01:07:52.523
Thank you.

01:08:12.139 --> 01:08:13.961
- Nice place.
- Yeah. Um-

01:08:14.059 --> 01:08:16.676
We should get you some dry clothes.
Here. Let me get this.

01:08:16.778 --> 01:08:19.560
- Oh, thank you.
- Laundry room's that way.
Bathroom's right over there.

01:08:19.658 --> 01:08:22.593
Uh, kitchen's right here. Go whichever way
you think you should go.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.586
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Sure.

01:08:29.227 --> 01:08:32.194
Mind if I throw some of my clothes
in with yours?

01:08:32.298 --> 01:08:35.015
No. Not at all. Wow.
Laundry room in your apartment.

01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:39.042
- As far as I'm concerned,
that's when you know you've arrived.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

01:08:39.147 --> 01:08:42.049
[Chuckles] You know what?
I should wash this too. Hold on.

01:08:42.154 --> 01:08:45.002
Okay.
[Sighs]

01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:57.443
Oh. Oh, shoot.

01:08:57.546 --> 01:09:00.928
- Toss this in for me, will ya?
- Um, yeah. Sure.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.856
<i>- Thanks.
- [Phone Rings]</i>

01:09:02.953 --> 01:09:06.249
- Oh. I should get this. I'll be right back.
- Okay. I'll be in here.

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:12.008
Since when does a washing machine
need an L.C.D. Screen?

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.407
- [Beeps]
- Okay.

01:09:28.618 --> 01:09:31.335
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
What is going on?

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.638
Oh, my gosh.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:35.876
Oh, no!

01:09:35.978 --> 01:09:39.011
Stop! Please stop! Stop!

01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:42.375
- [Beeping]
- Um, off.

01:09:42.473 --> 01:09:43.880
Off!
[Groans]

01:09:45.353 --> 01:09:47.207
What are you, possessed? Oh!

01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:51.779
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah! Everything's fine.

01:09:51.881 --> 01:09:53.769
<i>- Okay.
- Oh!</i>

01:09:55.594 --> 01:09:58.889
What is going on?
Okay. Water off.

01:09:58.985 --> 01:10:00.992
Water off! Oh!

01:10:01.098 --> 01:10:03.519
- Oh, God!
- [Beeping]

01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:05.600
Off! Off!

01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:07.330
- [Whirring]
- No, not spin!

01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:10.975
<i>- [Whirring]
- [Gasping] Oh, my God.</i>

01:10:11.081 --> 01:10:12.903
Hello?

01:10:16.681 --> 01:10:19.201
Oh, my God. Oh!

01:10:19.305 --> 01:10:21.890
<i>- Stop! Please stop!
- [Jake] Okay. Uh-</i>

01:10:21.993 --> 01:10:23.815
I'm sorry.

01:10:23.913 --> 01:10:25.571
I'm so sorry.

01:10:25.673 --> 01:10:28.128
I got it. I got it. I got-

01:10:31.593 --> 01:10:33.698
- How'd you do that?
- [Chuckles]

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.418
Uh, there's a- there's an off button
on the L.C.D. Screen.

01:10:38.089 --> 01:10:42.693
What can I say? I am a pathetic
disaster, and I give up.

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:45.759
- You give up?
- I give up. I don't care anymore.

01:10:45.865 --> 01:10:48.036
You know what?
It feels great.

01:10:50.505 --> 01:10:54.465
You know what? I gave up years ago.
It's my secret to happiness.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.775
Oh! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.019
- Play fair.
- Oh.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.527
- Ow.
- Oh, no.

01:11:03.624 --> 01:11:04.671
- Oh, man.
- Your eye?

01:11:04.776 --> 01:11:06.118
- You're done.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:06.216 --> 01:11:08.039
No.

01:11:10.473 --> 01:11:13.407
Oh, cool!

01:11:13.512 --> 01:11:16.130
Oh, am I interrupting something?

01:11:16.232 --> 01:11:18.501
- Hi, Katy.
- Hi.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.659
- Wait. You're Katy?
- Last time I checked.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.702
Hi. I'm Ashley.

01:11:28.456 --> 01:11:31.238
<i>No. No, that's not a problem.
I'm on it. Yeah.</i>

01:11:31.336 --> 01:11:33.725
So, Jake tells me you're a loser.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:36.003
What? I'm not a loser.

01:11:36.103 --> 01:11:37.762
That's cool.
I'm a loser too.

01:11:37.863 --> 01:11:41.376
Anyway, it's just like a term of affection,
not a permanent condition.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.869
- Oh.
- You just haven't had any good luck. That's all.

01:11:43.976 --> 01:11:45.438
No, no. It's great.

01:11:45.543 --> 01:11:47.201
I love these
little marshmallow things.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.508
So do I.

01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:52.575
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
We'll talk later. All right, sir. Bye.

01:11:52.679 --> 01:11:54.501
<i>- [Chuckles] Oh, my God.
- Hot.</i>

01:11:54.599 --> 01:11:58.974
- What's the problem?
- Oh, Phillips wants the new
song ready before the concert.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.251
- And?
- And we don't have shit.

01:12:03.559 --> 01:12:05.796
I mean shoot.
We don't have shoot.

01:12:05.896 --> 01:12:08.613
<i>We don't have to tell Aunt Martha
about this, do we?</i>

01:12:08.711 --> 01:12:11.199
<i>Don't stress it.
I'll write you a kick-ass song.</i>

01:12:11.304 --> 01:12:13.922
<i>Oh, so you're a-you're a songwriter now?
Very funny.</i>

01:12:14.023 --> 01:12:15.846
- You could be more supportive.
- This is serious.

01:12:15.943 --> 01:12:17.765
- This is my life we're-
- Guy- Guys-

01:12:17.863 --> 01:12:19.685
- No shoot.
- No shoot. That-

01:12:19.783 --> 01:12:22.205
Uh- I think I can help you out.

01:12:22.311 --> 01:12:23.838
What do you have in mind?

01:12:23.943 --> 01:12:26.332
Well, I have this friend-

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:47.775
What a song.

01:12:50.022 --> 01:12:52.990
I totally understand. If you don't
want to use it, it's cool.

01:12:53.095 --> 01:12:54.884
No. No, it's great.

01:12:54.982 --> 01:12:56.990
<i>Just a few little adjustments.</i>

01:12:57.094 --> 01:12:59.004
Hey, Harry.
Double the tempo.

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:02.274
Danny, Tom, why don't you
kick it off tight and rough it up a bit?

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.012
- Ashley.
- Yeah?

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:26.557
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:13:45.158 --> 01:13:46.980
Hey.

01:13:47.973 --> 01:13:50.526
So I hear a rumor that, uh,
you have another hit for me.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:53.729
Well, it's, uh- it's rough,
but I got a good feeling, sir. Yeah.

01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:56.699
Sounds good. Positivity.
That's what I like.

01:13:56.806 --> 01:13:59.075
Oh, yeah. Congratulations
on, uh, selling out.

01:13:59.174 --> 01:14:01.061
Selling out?

01:14:01.157 --> 01:14:03.907
You mean the Hard Rock?
We sold out the Hard Rock?

01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:05.860
- I BlackBerried you.
- I don't have a BlackBerry.

01:14:05.957 --> 01:14:07.779
- Tiffany, get him a BlackBerry.
- Yes.

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:11.172
- There's a line around the corner
of people just hoping to get in.
- Ah?

01:14:11.269 --> 01:14:13.757
Hey, hey, hey. I don't hug people,
but, look, bro.

01:14:13.861 --> 01:14:17.090
You saved my life twice. Once
at the masquerade bash and- and now.

01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:19.077
<i>L- It was
a great night for me too.</i>

01:14:19.173 --> 01:14:22.337
I mean, ever since then I've been
about the luckiest guy in the world.

01:14:22.437 --> 01:14:25.753
- [Chuckles]
- Look. Come by my office later.

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.683
<i>- It can't be.
- I got some ideas.</i>

01:14:27.781 --> 01:14:29.952
<i>- [Jake] Okay.
- Geez.</i>

01:14:30.054 --> 01:14:32.574
Jake. Jake is the guy I kissed
at the masquerade bash.

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:33.921
- Uh-uh.
- Yes.

01:14:34.021 --> 01:14:35.166
- No.
- Yes.

01:14:35.269 --> 01:14:36.610
- No.
- Yes.

01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:39.971
Yes! That's great. He's hot.

01:14:40.069 --> 01:14:41.923
You don't understand.
If I kiss Jake...

01:14:42.021 --> 01:14:45.120
it's hello,
fabulous carefree life.

01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:47.610
And that's a problem?

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:50.586
- Well-
- Go.

01:15:11.236 --> 01:15:13.058
- Ashley.
- No, no, no.

01:15:13.156 --> 01:15:15.011
Um, I have to go now.

01:15:15.109 --> 01:15:18.687
<i>- ##[Continues]
- Uh, now?</i>

01:15:27.972 --> 01:15:29.532
<i>- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.</i>

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.250
- Taxi!
- [Tires Screeching]

01:15:41.348 --> 01:15:44.097
Sorry. I was just
checking something.

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.932
[Gasps]
Five dollars. Yes.

01:15:52.036 --> 01:15:53.891
- Thank you, luck.
- Ashley?

01:15:53.988 --> 01:15:55.842
Miss Braden.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.395
Listen. I am so sorry for-

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.572
- Antonio?
- Hey, Ash.

01:16:00.676 --> 01:16:03.131
- Hi.
- How lucky that we ran into you.

01:16:03.235 --> 01:16:05.788
I feel just horrible about
those things I said to you.

01:16:05.892 --> 01:16:08.161
No. Stop. You were right
to blame it all on me.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:13.595
Then let me blame you for bringing this sweet,
wonderful, iron-tushed man into my life.

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:15.641
Yes. We're getting married, baby.

01:16:15.748 --> 01:16:18.268
- No way!
- It's true. I bought him the ring.

01:16:18.372 --> 01:16:21.950
<i>- Well, good for you guys. Congratulations.
- Ashley...</i>

01:16:22.052 --> 01:16:24.157
I want you to come back
to work for me.

01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:29.372
- Are you kidding?
- I can't lose you. You are my good luck charm.

01:16:29.475 --> 01:16:31.036
L- I don't know what to say.

01:16:31.139 --> 01:16:34.554
Well, we have a huge pitch tonight.
St. Regis at 8:00.

01:16:34.659 --> 01:16:37.026
So, say you'll be by my side...

01:16:37.124 --> 01:16:40.506
and say you'll be wearing something
appropriate to your new vice president title.

01:16:40.612 --> 01:16:44.124
Oh, my gosh. Yes. Yes.
Thank you.

01:16:44.227 --> 01:16:46.049
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:16:46.147 --> 01:16:48.635
Oh! Yes! My luck is back!

01:16:48.739 --> 01:16:50.561
Oh, my God.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:54.430
<i>- Hello.
- [Maggie] Ash?</i>

01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:57.314
Anyone want some late lunch?

01:16:57.411 --> 01:16:59.266
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

01:16:59.362 --> 01:17:01.599
Hey. I have some surprises.

01:17:01.699 --> 01:17:05.528
Ta-da! Last one in stock,
and just my size. Lucky, huh?

01:17:05.634 --> 01:17:08.351
- Yeah.
- And I went to Miyakami
and got two orders of everything...

01:17:08.451 --> 01:17:10.873
'cause I thought we could use
a little celebration.

01:17:10.978 --> 01:17:14.012
- That's nice.
- Oh. Yeah.

01:17:14.114 --> 01:17:15.805
What's wrong?

01:17:15.907 --> 01:17:18.394
The band isn't
gonna do Maggie's song.

01:17:18.499 --> 01:17:20.092
What? Why not?

01:17:20.194 --> 01:17:22.583
Phillips is superstitious.

01:17:22.691 --> 01:17:24.349
<i>- Come on.
- He thinks that new groups...</i>

01:17:24.451 --> 01:17:27.069
should only perform music
that they've written themselves.

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:29.691
- That's crazy.
- No. It's just bad luck.

01:17:29.794 --> 01:17:32.958
<i>Look. I'm sorry this is happening.
I didn't have anything to do with-</i>

01:17:33.058 --> 01:17:36.735
Ashley, stop. It's not your fault.
It's life. Right?

01:17:36.835 --> 01:17:41.144
Come on. We gotta get going. We gotta get
there before they go on. I want to wish them luck.

01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:45.440
- You're still going?
- Oh, yeah. We have V.I.P.
Tickets. Why waste 'em? You?

01:17:45.538 --> 01:17:49.596
<i>- Um, actually, I'm not. I have, um, a meeting.
- [Door Opens]</i>

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:52.447
- Job interview?
- Actually, it's a funny story.

01:17:52.546 --> 01:17:56.288
<i>- Um, Peggy rehired me.
- Ashley!</i>

01:17:56.386 --> 01:17:58.426
I am so proud of you.

01:17:59.906 --> 01:18:02.721
You totally stuck it out,
and it all got better.

01:18:02.817 --> 01:18:04.825
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.752
Of course.
What choice do I have?

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:08.989
If you dwell on
all the bad things in life...

01:18:09.089 --> 01:18:11.478
- you miss out on all the good things.
- It's getting late.

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:14.171
- Well, have fun.
- Good luck on your meeting, Ashley.

01:18:14.274 --> 01:18:16.183
Thanks.

01:18:17.186 --> 01:18:19.160
<i>Bye.</i>

01:18:58.849 --> 01:19:00.704
<i>- ##[Continues]

01:19:00.801 --> 01:19:03.518

Look how many people there are.</i>

01:19:07.489 --> 01:19:09.758
- [Danny] Hottie, mate. There's a hottie there.
- [Tom] Yeah.

01:19:09.857 --> 01:19:12.246

Oh, by the way, have you seen
Harry anywhere?

01:20:58.463 --> 01:21:00.438
He's- He's not here?

01:21:03.519 --> 01:21:05.428
Hello?

01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:10.520

[Phillips]
D.M.R.'s got the money, baby!

01:21:37.502 --> 01:21:40.764
Excuse me, sir. Could you make a left
up ahead? Union Square's always a mess.

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:42.685
I can't believe
you blew off Peggy Braden.

01:21:42.783 --> 01:21:45.597
She'll get over it. LfJake's bad luck
is half as bad as mine was...

01:21:45.694 --> 01:21:47.582
then we don't have much time.

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.667
Harry. Harry, are you in here?

01:21:52.766 --> 01:21:54.588
- Hey. Has anyone seen Harry?
- [All] No.

01:21:54.686 --> 01:21:57.468
- Excuse me. Has anyone
seen Harry? The drummer.
- No.

01:21:57.566 --> 01:22:00.435
- Harry!
- Has- Has anybody got a 20 on the drummer?

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:02.364
[Headset: Woman]
What's he look like?

01:22:02.462 --> 01:22:04.763
Yeah. I don't know.
They all look alike to me.

01:22:07.198 --> 01:22:09.435
Harry!

01:22:11.678 --> 01:22:13.565
Harry.

01:22:15.326 --> 01:22:17.268
<i>- Harry.

01:22:17.374 --> 01:22:19.261
Harry.

01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:21.497
<i>- He's not here.
- [Man #2] We want McFly!</i>

01:22:21.598 --> 01:22:23.540
He's not here either.

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:30.516
- [Laughing]
- Ah, but then- No, no. No, no, no.

01:22:30.622 --> 01:22:32.444
- Jake, baby!
- Hey!

01:22:32.542 --> 01:22:35.509
I understand the drill- keep 'em waiting-
but the natives are gettin' restless.

01:22:35.613 --> 01:22:38.515
<i>- We thought it was normal
to go up a half hour late.
- Jake.</i>

01:22:38.622 --> 01:22:41.077
Jake, we can't find Harry anywhere.
He's not upstairs. He's gone.

01:22:41.182 --> 01:22:43.189
- Checked the loos. He's not in men's or women's.
- No.

01:22:43.293 --> 01:22:45.366
There something
you want to tell me, Jake?

01:22:46.525 --> 01:22:48.413
We-We have a problem.

01:22:52.766 --> 01:22:55.864
Hello?
What the hell is that?

01:23:03.486 --> 01:23:06.006
- Oh! We're so late. Come on! Come on!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:23:06.109 --> 01:23:09.208
Thank you! Wait. You guys.
You guys. Backstage is this way.

01:23:09.309 --> 01:23:11.730
Come on. Hi. Excuse me.
Watch out, buddy.

01:23:11.837 --> 01:23:13.844
- Come on!
- [Dana] Hold on a second, girls.

01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:15.859
[Ashley] Catch up, Dana.
You got the passes.

01:23:15.965 --> 01:23:17.624
<i>[Man]
Let's go!</i>

01:23:17.725 --> 01:23:19.864
Hello.

01:23:19.965 --> 01:23:22.332
<i>Hello.</i>

01:23:24.093 --> 01:23:25.915
And I, for one...

01:23:26.013 --> 01:23:30.421
am not looking forward to going
out here and telling this angry crowd...

01:23:30.525 --> 01:23:33.046
that the band decided
not to play.

01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:35.386
Oh. That won't be me.

01:23:35.484 --> 01:23:37.307
That's gonna be you.

01:23:37.404 --> 01:23:40.568
<i>Unless you get your boys
out there now!</i>

01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:42.491
<i>Mr. Phillips,
without a-a drummer?</i>

01:23:42.589 --> 01:23:44.411
- No way.
- It won't work.

01:23:44.509 --> 01:23:49.594
<i>Hey, guys. I used to be the, uh, backup
drummer for, uh, Whitesnake.</i>

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:52.148
<i>- [All Groan]
- [Phillips] Whitesnake? Hell, yeah!</i>

01:23:52.252 --> 01:23:54.357
- There you go. Here's your drummer.
- Wait a minute.

01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:57.461
<i>- We're not gonna go out there without Harry.
- [Tom] It's not gonna happen.</i>

01:23:57.564 --> 01:23:59.386
McFly doesn't play...

01:23:59.484 --> 01:24:01.306
you'll be lucky enough
to manage...

01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:02.866
<i>- a high school marching band.
- [Ashley]Jake.</i>

01:24:02.972 --> 01:24:05.394
- Get out of the way.
- We got a problem. We need a new band.

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.631
<i>- Cancel the limo.
- Get out of the way, please. All right. Now go.</i>

01:24:08.732 --> 01:24:10.554
Ashley, now's not a-

- What the hell is this?
- [Together] Shh!

01:24:19.676 --> 01:24:24.281
And in nine, eight, seven-

01:24:25.244 --> 01:24:28.244
- Oh, no.
- Who hit the smoke?

01:24:28.348 --> 01:24:32.025
Five, four, three-

01:24:33.084 --> 01:24:35.222
Whoa.
[Coughing]

01:24:35.324 --> 01:24:37.112
Two-

01:24:40.604 --> 01:24:41.913
Whoa.

01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:43.638
Is that- Is that Harry?

01:24:47.387 --> 01:24:50.322
<i>[Woman]
Get started, baby!</i>

01:24:50.428 --> 01:24:52.566
We're on. We're on.

01:24:52.668 --> 01:24:55.864
- No way. The freak went on without us.
- [Mouthing Words]

01:24:55.964 --> 01:24:58.233
I don't believe it.

01:25:02.108 --> 01:25:04.442
Hey. Do me a favor.

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.442
- Play Maggie's song.
- Absolutely.

01:25:07.547 --> 01:25:09.489
Hey. Let's kick it off
with "I've Got You."

01:25:09.596 --> 01:25:11.450
Yeah. Definitely.
Come on. Let's go.

01:25:11.547 --> 01:25:14.165
<i>- [Doug] Phillips is gonna be pissed.

01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:22.840
Harry. Harry, we're playing
"I've Got You."

01:25:28.859 --> 01:25:31.062
Ashley. Thank you.

01:25:31.163 --> 01:25:33.749
You're welcome.

01:25:39.963 --> 01:25:42.865
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.945
Oh, I'm proud of you.

01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:13.265
- Katy!
- Yes!

01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:15.377
- They're great!
- It's good!

01:26:26.266 --> 01:26:27.924
Danny! Whoo!

01:26:29.179 --> 01:26:31.545
I thought I told you
not to play this song.

01:26:32.666 --> 01:26:35.514
Well, I guess
I'm not superstitious.

01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:37.999
But I am.

01:26:38.106 --> 01:26:40.408
I should fire you, Jake.

01:26:40.506 --> 01:26:43.156
But it works.

01:26:43.258 --> 01:26:45.625
It works. Good job.

01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:48.272
Thank you.

01:26:55.898 --> 01:26:58.069
They're playing my song!

01:27:18.521 --> 01:27:21.423
- Whoo!
- [Both] Whoo!

01:27:23.065 --> 01:27:24.887
Is that the sound
of them clapping...

01:27:24.985 --> 01:27:27.058
- or my nervous system shutting down?
- No. They're clapping.

01:27:27.161 --> 01:27:28.950
Hello, Times Square!

01:27:34.809 --> 01:27:36.402
- Congratulations!
- Ashley, thank you!

01:27:36.505 --> 01:27:39.025
<i>- [Danny] Great to be here, everybody.

Oh. Who wants to meet
my friend Mr. Dom Pérignon?

01:28:00.633 --> 01:28:02.543
- That would be the '94?
- Yeah!

01:28:02.649 --> 01:28:05.998

01:28:32.313 --> 01:28:35.760
- Come on. Let's go celebrate.
- Hey. Um, not now.

01:28:35.864 --> 01:28:37.686
What's wrong with you?
You look miserable.

01:28:39.737 --> 01:28:42.257
[Sighs] Maggie,
I think I've fallen for him.

01:28:44.216 --> 01:28:48.242
That's great.
What's the matter with that?

01:28:48.344 --> 01:28:54.007
I don't know. I mean, the feelings
I have generally lead toward kissing.

01:28:54.104 --> 01:28:56.591
So kiss him. Kiss him!

01:28:56.696 --> 01:28:59.030
I can't.

01:28:59.128 --> 01:29:01.015
Oh, Ash.

01:29:01.112 --> 01:29:04.146
Please don't tell me
you still believe in that stuff.

01:29:04.247 --> 01:29:06.582
More than ever.

01:29:06.679 --> 01:29:08.883
And I can't not kiss him.

01:29:12.695 --> 01:29:14.735
- I gotta go.
- What? Where are you going?

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.301
Grand Central.

01:29:16.408 --> 01:29:19.724
<i>I'm gonna visit
my parents for a bit.</i>

01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:23.443
I have to sort things out.
Give me a hug, you.

01:29:23.544 --> 01:29:25.911
Have fun, okay?
And be careful.

01:29:26.008 --> 01:29:27.830
Okay.

01:29:29.463 --> 01:29:31.285
Bye.

01:29:34.808 --> 01:29:37.142
Gather round. Gather round.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.294
Of course.

01:29:53.399 --> 01:29:55.821
<i>[Jake]
You waitin'for a train?</i>

01:29:55.927 --> 01:29:59.156
I'm just saying if you are,
you might as well give up now.

01:29:59.255 --> 01:30:01.077
<i>- Jake, please.
- With your luck...</i>

01:30:01.175 --> 01:30:04.241
there's gonna be an announcement
that due to some freak accident
all trains have been canceled.

01:30:04.343 --> 01:30:06.415
<i>Then you're gonna go outside
and wait for the bus...</i>

01:30:06.519 --> 01:30:10.064
at which point the acid rain will commence-
perhaps even acid hail. [Chuckles]

01:30:10.167 --> 01:30:13.582
Listen, Jake. I can't see you.
Okay? It's for your own good.

01:30:13.687 --> 01:30:15.759
Luck changes, Ashley.

01:30:15.863 --> 01:30:17.357
You know?

01:30:17.462 --> 01:30:21.586
You know, l- I kissed this amazing girl
at this masquerade party.

01:30:21.687 --> 01:30:24.883
No. Listen. I swear I'm not crazy, okay?
Our luck did get switched.

01:30:24.983 --> 01:30:28.812
And it still is.
Here. I dare you not to win.

01:30:28.919 --> 01:30:32.083
So you think meeting me
was unlucky?

01:30:32.182 --> 01:30:35.794
No. God, I'm lucky
to have met you.

01:30:35.895 --> 01:30:37.869
Okay?
But you deserve my luck.

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:41.716
- You put it to better use than I ever did.
- Well, I don't want it anymore.

01:30:41.814 --> 01:30:44.083
- Are you crazy?
- I want you to have it.

01:30:44.183 --> 01:30:47.182
- No. Go away.
- It's been great...

01:30:47.286 --> 01:30:49.173
but I'll be fine without it.

01:30:51.702 --> 01:30:53.841
How do you know that?

01:30:53.942 --> 01:30:56.309
Because I'll have you in my life.

01:30:56.406 --> 01:31:00.563
A few bumps and bruises along the way
are a small price to pay.

01:31:13.782 --> 01:31:15.669
Tag. You're it.

01:31:20.534 --> 01:31:23.981
Oh, no. You're not
gettin' away with it that easy.

01:31:27.285 --> 01:31:29.773
- Oh, yeah?
- Not a chance.

01:31:33.078 --> 01:31:35.445
So now who?

01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:37.429
[Mumbles]
Who cares?

01:31:40.885 --> 01:31:42.860
Ew! Gross!

01:31:42.965 --> 01:31:45.616
<i>You leave a kid sitting in a limo
so you can make out?</i>

01:31:45.718 --> 01:31:48.500
You take me from a perfectly good party
with really cute rock stars...

01:31:48.598 --> 01:31:50.420
I pop a shoelace,
swallow my gum...

01:31:50.518 --> 01:31:54.511
<i>and now I'm stuck here
watching you two play tonsil hockey.</i>

01:31:54.614 --> 01:31:56.883
<i>- Good grief!
- Katy.</i>

01:31:58.997 --> 01:32:01.136
I am so glad you're here.

01:32:02.645 --> 01:32:05.231
Why are you guys
looking at me like this?

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:08.300
- Hold still. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
- [Groaning]

01:32:08.405 --> 01:32:11.405
[Groans]
Oh, I've been slimed!

01:32:11.509 --> 01:32:14.323
- Try this. You'll like it.
- It's fun.

01:32:14.421 --> 01:32:16.309
Cool.

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.228
- So, where were we just, like-
- [Chuckles]

01:32:22.325 --> 01:32:23.502
- Ow.
- Ow.

01:32:23.605 --> 01:32:26.867
<i>Twenty-five bucks?
No freakin'way. I'm rich!</i>

01:32:26.964 --> 01:32:28.972
Oh, yeah! I'm rich!

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:32.176
I'm taking the limo, okay?
This I gotta show Grams.

01:32:32.276 --> 01:32:34.862
I definitely hit the jackpot.

01:32:34.965 --> 01:32:38.194
<i>- Hey, Bernie!
- Thank you.</i>

01:32:39.892 --> 01:32:41.747
She deserves it.

01:32:41.845 --> 01:32:44.114
- Pizza?
- You're on.

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.748
So, you think you can
adjust to life without luck?

01:32:48.852 --> 01:32:51.219
- Right now I've never felt luckier.
- Me too.

01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:53.650
- Do you believe in karma?
- Karma? Ash, you kidding me?

01:32:53.748 --> 01:32:57.523
One time I helped an old lady across the street.
Next day, I found a hundred-dollar bill.

01:32:57.621 --> 01:32:59.115
- Ash, that's luck.
- Karma.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.714
- It's luck.
- Karma, karma, karma.

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.096
- Luck, luck, luck.
- It's karma.

01:33:02.196 --> 01:33:03.440
- It's luck.
- Get the door.

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:07.314
Why, thank you.
[Chuckles]

01:33:07.412 --> 01:33:09.584
Hey. [Chuckles]
Quarter.

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:11.539
Hmm. Seems we still
have our luck.

01:33:11.636 --> 01:33:14.003
- Who cares?
- Absolutely.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.955
[Man] Hey! Shut the valve!
The pipe is broken.

01:33:19.305 --> 01:33:25.819
