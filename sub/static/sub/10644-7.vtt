Are you Emma's mom?

00:02.661 --> 00:04.528
- I am.
- What are you doing here?

00:04.529 --> 00:05.913
I have something for Emma,
and it doesn't concern you.

00:05.914 --> 00:07.491
There's something I need to get to Emma,

00:07.492 --> 00:08.916
and her father won't let me see her.

00:08.917 --> 00:11.168
<i>- Could you give it to her?
- No, I can't do that.</i>

00:11.169 --> 00:14.084
It's funny, you and I, that
we're here, and we're happy.

00:14.085 --> 00:16.837

00:23.509 --> 00:25.393
She doesn't want me to talk to you.

00:25.394 --> 00:27.541
Why don't you want him
to talk for himself?

00:27.542 --> 00:29.900
Because there's things that
he does not need to remember,

00:29.901 --> 00:31.702
and I have worked very
hard to make him forget

00:31.703 --> 00:34.321
about these things, and I
don't need you undoing it.

00:34.322 --> 00:36.323
Don't make him remember these things,

00:36.324 --> 00:38.708
or I will have to do something about it.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.893

Norman, um...

00:56.978 --> 00:59.313
one thing therapists
don't always like to tell

00:59.314 --> 01:01.682
their patients is that sometimes,

01:01.683 --> 01:04.920
for things to get better,
they have to feel worse first.

01:06.254 --> 01:09.048
I can't make that not true for you,

01:10.776 --> 01:13.438

02:22.430 --> 02:24.764
- Do you mind?
- Oh, no.

02:30.822 --> 02:33.022
Yeah, I'll start the coffee.

it was a good idea

03:21.740 --> 03:23.240
for a bunch of medicated psychos

03:23.241 --> 03:26.160
to spend the morning inhaling glue.

03:26.161 --> 03:29.079
- Nice cat, by the way.
- It's a dog.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.497

- Hi.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.784
Heading to work. What you got there?

04:40.785 --> 04:42.620
I was thinking about
making some new curtains

04:42.621 --> 04:44.538
for the kitchen and
maybe the living room.

04:44.539 --> 04:46.290
Wanted to since I moved in.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.125
I thought maybe if I
buy the fabric wholesale

04:48.126 --> 04:49.877
and do it myself...

04:49.878 --> 04:51.545
You're gonna make curtains.

04:51.546 --> 04:53.740
Yeah, I use to make my own
clothes in high school.

04:54.916 --> 04:57.668
This house is so cool.
I mean, look at this.

04:57.669 --> 04:59.303
Lookit, this is a frickin' fruit cellar

04:59.304 --> 05:01.722
if you just wiped all this junk away.

05:02.924 --> 05:06.093
I always wanted to plant more
fruit trees and preserve fruit.

05:06.094 --> 05:07.818
There's so much I want to do.

05:09.764 --> 05:11.598
Well, we could do that. I'll help you.

05:11.599 --> 05:13.067
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah... well,

05:13.068 --> 05:15.702
I can't make curtains,
but I can plant a tree.

05:16.771 --> 05:18.398
Yeah, I'll start this weekend.

05:20.025 --> 05:22.409
All right. I gotta go, but
just start thinking about

05:22.410 --> 05:24.194
what kind of fruit
trees you want to pick,

05:24.195 --> 05:26.030
and I'll go buy them and
whatever else you need.

05:26.031 --> 05:27.530
Yeah?

05:30.835 --> 05:32.836
- Alex?
- Yeah?

05:32.837 --> 05:35.372
- Don't worry about it.
- What? Why?

05:35.373 --> 05:38.175
It's... I'm...

05:38.176 --> 05:39.626
I don't want you spending
your money on it.

05:39.627 --> 05:40.878
That's not what I was asking.

05:40.879 --> 05:42.463
Oh, come on. I don't mind.

05:42.464 --> 05:43.574
Yeah, but that's not
why I brought it up.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.101
It's so silly.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.645
I don't really have any money.

05:50.188 --> 05:52.022
You know, we haven't
really had enough guests

05:52.023 --> 05:53.941
since they put the road
in to even break even.

05:53.942 --> 05:55.476
I'm behind on a lot of bills,

05:55.477 --> 05:56.777
so the last thing I
should be thinking about

05:56.778 --> 05:58.896
is home improvements.
It's bad accounting.

05:58.897 --> 06:01.981
- Norma, why didn't you tell me?
- Because it's embarrassing.

06:07.155 --> 06:09.239
I was so excited when I first
showed Norman this place.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.723
I had so many ideas on how to fix it.

06:13.211 --> 06:16.431
It's an amazing house, and I just
kind of gave up on it, but...

06:17.665 --> 06:20.167
I feel like taking it on.

06:20.168 --> 06:22.336
So I'm gonna start with the curtains,

06:22.337 --> 06:24.671
and then we can work on
it one thing at a time.

06:24.672 --> 06:27.057
There's no rush. Mm-kay?

06:27.058 --> 06:29.510
And I know things will pick up
in the spring, and, you know,

06:29.511 --> 06:31.511
this... what are you doing?

06:35.984 --> 06:38.902
Remember that day I told you I was
hiding a bunch of money down here?

06:38.903 --> 06:42.022
- Yeah.
- Well, I actually was.

06:42.023 --> 06:43.440
[stifling laughter]

06:43.441 --> 06:46.075
- Open it.
- [laughs]

06:51.750 --> 06:52.966
Where did you get this?

06:54.702 --> 06:57.286
It was Bob Paris' getaway cash.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.793
Oh, I... no, I can't do that.

07:06.264 --> 07:09.182
Well, it would help me 'cause I
don't know what to do with it.

07:13.388 --> 07:15.773
Look, this money... it
doesn't belong to anybody,

07:15.774 --> 07:17.975
and who knows how he got it?

07:17.976 --> 07:20.694
And, honestly, I couldn't
think of a better use for it

07:20.695 --> 07:22.396
than to put it back out in the world

07:22.397 --> 07:24.031
through your hands.

07:24.032 --> 07:26.116
You've had nothing but bad
breaks since you moved here.

07:26.117 --> 07:27.987
And you deserve some good ones.

07:29.904 --> 07:33.240
I mean, think of it like it's
like a balancing of the scales.

07:33.241 --> 07:34.824
Some positive karma.

07:38.163 --> 07:40.463
Please take it. It'll help me.

07:51.426 --> 07:55.011
I wish we could just erase all
the bad things that have happened.

<i>Hello?</i>

08:15.750 --> 08:18.284
Hello. Uh, is my mother there?

08:21.539 --> 08:23.873
Uh, yeah, she's right here, Norman.

08:26.544 --> 08:27.894
Hi, honey.

08:28.847 --> 08:30.631
Everything okay, Mother?

08:30.632 --> 08:32.966
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

08:32.967 --> 08:35.802
Oh, the sheriff is there
answering your phone,

08:35.803 --> 08:38.355
so I thought maybe you were
in trouble or something.

08:38.356 --> 08:40.524
No, no, uh, the stained-glass
window in the hallway

08:40.525 --> 08:43.309
needed to be replaced, so he...
he just stopped by and helped me

08:43.311 --> 08:44.702
<i>put a new one in.</i>

08:48.950 --> 08:50.484
Norman?

08:50.485 --> 08:52.202
Mother, I'm coming home.

08:52.203 --> 08:55.622
- What do you mean?
- I'm coming home.

08:55.623 --> 08:57.324
<i>As soon as I can.</i>

08:57.325 --> 09:01.495
Is that... is that something
that you can just do?

09:01.496 --> 09:03.380
<i>I signed myself in voluntarily.</i>

09:03.381 --> 09:05.299
<i>I can leave whenever I want.</i>

09:05.300 --> 09:06.884
[mouthing word]

09:06.885 --> 09:09.720
Has something happened, Norman?

09:09.721 --> 09:11.755
No. No, no.

09:11.756 --> 09:13.674
Well, Dylan said that you
were doing really well.

09:13.675 --> 09:15.309
I mean, don't you think it would be good

09:15.310 --> 09:17.227
<i>to give it a little more time?</i>

09:17.228 --> 09:19.479
Oh, well, Dr. Edwards thinks
I've made significant progress

09:19.480 --> 09:21.098
and it's time for me to come home.

09:21.099 --> 09:24.206
<i>Is there some reason I shouldn't?</i>

09:26.020 --> 09:28.438
Of course not. I'm just surprised.

09:28.439 --> 09:29.869
I'm sure you are.

09:31.109 --> 09:32.967
I'll let you know when
you can pick me up.

09:38.093 --> 09:41.519
I'd like to know the procedure
for checking myself out, please.

09:43.814 --> 09:45.615
I'm a voluntary patient here.

09:45.616 --> 09:49.652
I believe that means I can go
home whenever I feel I'm ready.

09:49.653 --> 09:52.905
Not exactly. There are protocols.

09:52.906 --> 09:55.375
- Oh.
- As a voluntary patient,

09:55.376 --> 09:56.993
we ask that you write what we call

09:56.994 --> 10:00.880
a "three-day letter" formally
requesting your release.

10:00.881 --> 10:03.750
We then have 72 hours
to assess whether or not

10:03.751 --> 10:06.057
you meet the release requirements.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.106
What happens if I just stop payment?

10:10.107 --> 10:11.758
Well, you've already been pre-approved

10:11.759 --> 10:14.010
by your insurance
company for three months.

10:14.011 --> 10:17.096
- My insurance?
- Well, your stepfather's.

10:17.097 --> 10:19.599
Yes, we had to pull some
strings to get you approved

10:19.600 --> 10:20.900
for coverage quite quickly.

10:20.901 --> 10:23.754
Hmm. Oh, I see.

10:24.571 --> 10:26.739
Yes, you've arranged payment with...

10:26.740 --> 10:28.667
with my stepfather.

10:29.576 --> 10:32.945
I understand and... and... and very
much appreciate you doing that.

10:32.946 --> 10:36.282
Everyone here has been so
very thoughtful and kind,

10:36.283 --> 10:39.118
uh, but I'm leaving,
and so I will just go

10:39.119 --> 10:41.954
and prepare the necessary paperwork.

10:41.955 --> 10:44.624
- Norman.
- Yeah?

10:44.625 --> 10:47.593
Have you told Dr. Edwards your wishes?

10:47.594 --> 10:48.961
Not yet.

10:48.962 --> 10:50.629
I will.

10:52.299 --> 10:53.633
<i>Well, Dad, you don't understand that</i>

10:53.634 --> 10:55.051
I can dictate the terms!

10:55.052 --> 10:56.269
That's not how it works with her.

10:56.270 --> 10:58.137
She doesn't play by any rules.

10:58.138 --> 11:00.173
Emma, please. Listen to me!

11:02.109 --> 11:03.726
I know her.

11:03.727 --> 11:06.979
I wish she was a different
person, but she's not.

11:06.980 --> 11:09.649
She's thinking she's got a
daughter that may not die.

11:09.650 --> 11:12.201
What that means to her, who knows?

11:12.202 --> 11:14.287
But I guarantee you it's about her,

11:14.288 --> 11:15.655
and not about you.

11:15.656 --> 11:17.156
[door closes]

11:17.157 --> 11:19.325
I, uh, brought some breakfast.

11:19.326 --> 11:20.910
We're fighting about my mother.

11:20.911 --> 11:22.908
It's not a fight. It's a discussion.

11:24.631 --> 11:26.082
Dylan, you can back me up here.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.476
Audrey was a mess at the hospital, yeah?

11:33.173 --> 11:34.477
You met my mother?

11:38.429 --> 11:40.964
Dylan, please tell her.

11:42.182 --> 11:43.606
Why didn't you tell me?

11:46.236 --> 11:48.654
I...

11:48.655 --> 11:50.439
I didn't want to upset you.

12:11.929 --> 12:13.366
You, uh,

12:14.431 --> 12:17.403
- you left this.
- Thank you.

12:25.943 --> 12:28.394
So your, uh, your...
your dad finally told you

12:28.395 --> 12:30.415
that she came to the hospital.

12:34.902 --> 12:36.869
I'm sorry I didn't tell you myself.

12:36.870 --> 12:38.210
I should have.

12:39.573 --> 12:41.874
But your... your dad had really
strong feelings about her,

12:41.875 --> 12:43.421
and she... she seemed...

12:44.411 --> 12:46.275
she seemed complicated.

12:51.368 --> 12:53.502
Her cell phone's no longer in service.

12:56.006 --> 12:57.306
What?

12:57.307 --> 12:58.925
That's what we were fighting about.

12:58.926 --> 13:01.010
He told me about the hospital,
and I tried to call her,

13:01.011 --> 13:03.346
and it was one of these
automated messages...

13:03.347 --> 13:05.793
"This phone is no longer
in service" thing.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.312
Well, m-maybe she got a new number.

13:10.237 --> 13:11.487
Yeah,

13:11.488 --> 13:13.606
or maybe she forgot to pay the bill.

13:13.607 --> 13:15.274
Or couldn't afford it.

13:15.275 --> 13:17.967
Or just didn't bother
telling us she changed it.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.750
I can't help that she's my
mother and she reached out,

13:24.751 --> 13:27.612
and I... I want to see her, but
I just don't know where she is.

13:40.467 --> 13:41.517
[knocking on door]

13:41.518 --> 13:44.103
Yeah?

13:44.104 --> 13:47.189
Rebecca Hamilton from the
bank is here to see you.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.025
She says she has your new checks.

13:49.026 --> 13:51.193
Asked if she could give
them to you personally.

13:51.194 --> 13:53.062
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah. Have her come in.

13:53.063 --> 13:55.364
That's what I thought you'd say.

13:55.365 --> 13:57.483
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:57.484 --> 13:58.868
Uh, you busy?

13:58.869 --> 14:00.569
No. Yeah, we're good. Thanks.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.075
Maybe not such a good idea
for you to be showing up here.

14:06.076 --> 14:08.661
I came here on official bank business.

14:08.662 --> 14:10.496
For your joint checking account.

14:10.497 --> 14:12.714
Alex Romero and Norma Bates.

14:14.668 --> 14:17.109

evicted a week ago.

26:44.828 --> 26:47.413
<i>Had to hire movers to haul her crap.</i>

26:47.414 --> 26:48.864
What did she leave?

26:48.865 --> 26:50.950
- <i>[knocking sound]
- Uh, everything.</i>

26:50.951 --> 26:53.002
Listen, are you looking
for an apartment?

26:53.003 --> 26:55.871
Otherwise, I've got stuff to do.

26:55.872 --> 26:57.492
No, I'm good. Thanks.

26:59.209 --> 27:02.210
[indistinct chatter]

27:10.270 --> 27:12.305
What are you doing here, Mother?

27:12.306 --> 27:14.140
I can't leave yet.

27:14.141 --> 27:16.783
There's a waiting period.
I said that I'd call you.

27:17.334 --> 27:20.145
I know. I know. I'm not...
I'm not here to pick you up.

27:27.404 --> 27:28.904
I'm so proud of you.

27:28.905 --> 27:30.790
I'm so proud of the
work that you're doing.

27:30.791 --> 27:32.291
And...

27:32.292 --> 27:37.046
um, but, a-as much as I
want you to come home too...

27:37.047 --> 27:41.467
I-I think it might be worth
it if you give it more time.

27:41.468 --> 27:44.303
And we were so lucky to
get you in this place.

27:44.304 --> 27:47.757
- "We"?
- We. Yeah, "we."

27:47.758 --> 27:50.091
We. You and me. We.

27:55.816 --> 27:58.484
You know...

27:58.485 --> 28:01.654
Dr. Edwards is such a good doctor,

28:01.655 --> 28:03.572
and, um...

28:03.573 --> 28:05.658
and I know you've been working hard,

28:05.659 --> 28:08.527
but real change takes time,

28:08.528 --> 28:10.663
and if you just work with
him just a little longer,

28:10.664 --> 28:13.362
you'll be that much stronger
when you do come home.

28:14.001 --> 28:16.252
All right? That makes sense, doesn't it?

28:16.253 --> 28:17.918
It does.

28:21.425 --> 28:22.842
I'm just wondering, Mother,

28:22.843 --> 28:25.928
is this your idea or your husband's?

28:25.929 --> 28:28.797
<i>[swelling orchestral music]</i>

28:30.183 --> 28:31.517
I perfectly understand

28:31.518 --> 28:34.136
that newlyweds often want time alone.

28:34.137 --> 28:36.389
Is that it? If I come home now,

28:36.390 --> 28:38.462
will I be in the way of your honeymoon?

28:41.278 --> 28:43.533
I don't know what you're
talking about, Norman.

28:45.365 --> 28:47.781
Don't embarrass yourself by lying to me.

28:49.202 --> 28:50.552
Okay...

28:52.572 --> 28:54.990
Yes. [scoffs]

28:54.991 --> 28:56.876
I... okay.

28:56.877 --> 28:59.879
It's not how it looks. Norm...
it's not what you think.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.797
Okay, I did it for
the medical insurance.

29:01.798 --> 29:03.382
I don't believe you.

29:03.383 --> 29:05.301
Norman, no. Pineview is expensive.

29:05.302 --> 29:08.671
You needed help, and I did it for you.

29:08.672 --> 29:10.506
- He answered our phone.
- Yes.

29:10.507 --> 29:13.726
He was in our house. Have
you been sleeping with him?

29:13.727 --> 29:15.978
What are you talking about?

29:15.979 --> 29:18.597
I can't even believe that
you are asking me this.

29:18.598 --> 29:20.399
I can't believe you're doing it.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.601
Don't look at me like
that. I can't bear it.

29:22.602 --> 29:25.404
Stop. Stop!

29:25.405 --> 29:28.157
I did it for the insurance.
That's it. I swear, Norman.

29:28.158 --> 29:30.943
That's all. He is a public figure.

29:30.944 --> 29:33.913
It has to look real.
That's all it is. I swear.

29:33.914 --> 29:36.082
I... I... I love you.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.667
Everything I have ever done,
I have done it for you.

29:38.668 --> 29:41.787
You are my child. You are my priority.

29:41.788 --> 29:43.706
- Then prove it.
- How? What?

29:43.707 --> 29:45.707
Let me come home.

29:47.544 --> 29:50.429
I...

29:50.430 --> 29:52.515
but I...

29:52.516 --> 29:57.470
I don't think that that's
what's best for you.

29:57.471 --> 30:00.606
Please, Mother. Please.

30:00.607 --> 30:03.192
I've done everything that you asked.

30:03.193 --> 30:05.144
I came here, and I stayed,

30:05.145 --> 30:07.029
and I made an effort,
and I've made progress.

30:07.030 --> 30:08.646
Even the doctor says so.

30:09.616 --> 30:12.818
And I'm taking medication, and
I'll keep seeing Dr. Edwards.

30:12.819 --> 30:15.905
I just can't stay here. I...
I want to be home with you.

30:15.906 --> 30:18.407
I need to come home, Mother.

30:18.408 --> 30:21.242
Please. Please let me come home.

30:24.164 --> 30:25.547
Oh, please.

30:28.301 --> 30:31.337
- Okay.
- Of course you can come home.

30:31.338 --> 30:32.471
I'm so sorry.

30:32.472 --> 30:33.839
[sighs]

30:33.840 --> 30:36.892
You can come home.

30:36.893 --> 30:38.394
Oh, thank you.

30:38.395 --> 30:41.035
I'll keep seeing Dr. Edwards, I promise.

30:42.482 --> 30:45.350
[breathing heavily]

30:55.905 --> 30:57.978
That's how I knew your mom
was staying at the motel.

30:59.730 --> 31:01.659
[paper crinkling]

31:08.345 --> 31:11.347
I tracked down her landlord,

31:11.348 --> 31:13.649
and she said that she
hadn't heard from your mom,

31:13.650 --> 31:16.429
and that your mom owed back,
like, four months' rent,

31:18.522 --> 31:20.849
so they had to get rid of
her stuff and evict her.

31:26.613 --> 31:28.215
Did you read this?

31:29.666 --> 31:31.033
I think that, you know,

31:31.034 --> 31:32.618
it seems like she wants
to get to know you

31:32.619 --> 31:33.981
and make an effort.

31:36.707 --> 31:39.258
What it says is that she wants
to tell me about why she left.

31:39.259 --> 31:41.677
What it means is that she
actually wants to tell me

31:41.678 --> 31:44.079
horrible things about my dad.

31:47.084 --> 31:48.777
Are you sure?

31:50.988 --> 31:53.456
All that stuff you found out
about the disconnected phone.

31:53.457 --> 31:55.596
The back rent. It all makes sense.

31:56.643 --> 31:58.478
She's broke.

31:58.479 --> 32:00.279
She wanted to make us feel sorry for her

32:00.280 --> 32:01.798
so that we'd bail her out.

32:04.234 --> 32:06.152
She did it a few times
when I was little,

32:06.153 --> 32:08.653
until my dad finally
told her to go to hell.

32:11.658 --> 32:14.144
I can't keep pretending
like I don't remember that.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.883
She's not a very good person.

32:25.055 --> 32:27.889
I'm such an idiot.

32:30.060 --> 32:32.562
- No, no.
- No, it's fine.

32:32.563 --> 32:34.647
I don't need someone who doesn't...

32:34.648 --> 32:36.932
who doesn't want me.

32:40.938 --> 32:42.938
I want you.

32:51.832 --> 32:53.202
I love you.

33:10.717 --> 33:12.935
Oh, Nurse Penny said I
could have ten more minutes.

33:12.936 --> 33:14.535
Oh, that's fine.

33:15.439 --> 33:17.473
Just wanted to talk to you.

33:17.474 --> 33:19.983
- May I? Uh?
- Of course.

33:26.650 --> 33:29.117
I feel like I owe you an apology.

33:31.905 --> 33:33.873
Why?

33:33.874 --> 33:36.626
You're smart. You're capable.

33:36.627 --> 33:39.579
You can understand more than
many of my other patients,

33:39.580 --> 33:42.497
and, as a result, I think
I pushed you too hard.

33:43.402 --> 33:45.585
No, I... I...

33:45.586 --> 33:48.421
it's fine. I don't think you did.

33:48.422 --> 33:52.592
A couple of days ago, I felt
we were on the same page.

33:52.593 --> 33:55.561
What changed for you?

33:55.562 --> 33:57.063
Nothing changed.

33:57.064 --> 33:59.515
I just think that I'll be better served

33:59.516 --> 34:01.526
being in my home environment.

34:04.404 --> 34:08.190
- Are you scared to go home?
- No. Of course not.

34:08.190 --> 34:12.612
Look, I feel calmer
already on the medication.

34:12.612 --> 34:15.197
Okay, so you're calmer,

34:15.197 --> 34:17.032
but what if the blackouts still happen?

34:20.871 --> 34:22.255
I know what you're doing.

34:22.255 --> 34:25.121
- What am I doing?
- You're trying to scare me.

34:29.263 --> 34:31.806
Don't you think you
should be scared, Norman?

34:33.132 --> 34:36.351
When you have these blackouts,
you become a different person,

34:36.353 --> 34:37.887
Norman, you move differently.

34:37.888 --> 34:39.138
You speak differently.

34:39.139 --> 34:41.474
You experience the world differently.

34:41.475 --> 34:43.976
You have different impulses.

34:43.976 --> 34:45.695
Now, if that happened
to me, I'd be scared.

34:45.696 --> 34:47.112
Well, I'm not you.

34:47.114 --> 34:50.815
No. You, Norman, are a kind,

34:50.817 --> 34:54.120
sensitive, empathetic,
intelligent person.

34:54.121 --> 34:56.322
You disassociate because
that version of you

34:56.322 --> 34:58.824
hasn't been capable of
navigating your world.

34:58.825 --> 35:01.377
Now, do you really feel like you've
done the work to change that?

35:01.378 --> 35:03.244
I don't know!

35:09.836 --> 35:12.170
Do you want me to admit I'm scared?

35:14.808 --> 35:16.270
Yes, I'm scared.

35:18.679 --> 35:20.262
I don't like that I can't remember.

35:20.263 --> 35:22.202
I don't like that I go away.

35:24.935 --> 35:26.627
But I am also glad...

35:27.821 --> 35:29.572
Glad that I'm taking the medication...

35:29.573 --> 35:31.440
I hope it helps... and mostly,

35:31.441 --> 35:32.775
above everything else,

35:32.776 --> 35:35.048
I am so glad that I have you.

35:38.415 --> 35:41.534
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.

35:41.535 --> 35:45.028
I don't want to leave here and
have you not care about me.

35:46.957 --> 35:48.791
But don't you think that it's possible

35:48.792 --> 35:50.926
that I might make even more progress

35:50.927 --> 35:52.928
if I'm near the person
who makes me feel complete

35:52.929 --> 35:55.681
and whole and safe?

35:55.682 --> 35:57.350
With you, and with her,

35:57.351 --> 35:58.884
I really think that I can get better.

35:58.885 --> 36:01.553
I... I really, really do.

36:05.142 --> 36:07.475
Will you please just
give me this chance?

36:17.821 --> 36:21.081
- All right.
- Thank you.

36:24.661 --> 36:28.381
We're going to start with
three sessions a week.

36:28.382 --> 36:30.915
- Three.
- Of course.

36:36.139 --> 36:38.808
I've got you, Norman.

36:38.809 --> 36:40.008
I promise.

36:43.230 --> 36:45.431
I'll sign your release.

36:45.432 --> 36:48.734
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

36:48.735 --> 36:50.518
Good night, Norman.

<i>[indistinct TV chatter]</i>

37:26.377 --> 37:28.374
Surprise!

37:30.548 --> 37:33.879
- You got a TV.
- Yeah! Well, for you.

37:35.770 --> 37:37.137
Okay, fine, it's for us.

37:37.138 --> 37:39.723
[laughs] What? Oh, come on.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.691
Well, you don't have a decent
one anywhere in the house,

37:41.692 --> 37:43.310
and I know how much you
like watching old movies.

37:43.311 --> 37:45.061
I thought you might actually
like seeing the picture,

37:45.062 --> 37:47.197
so I got the 60", and... hey, look,

37:47.198 --> 37:49.429
I picked up a couple of these guys.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.537
Well, what is it? What's wrong?

37:56.624 --> 37:59.209
I went to see Norman. I
told him he could come home.

37:59.210 --> 38:02.077
<i>[swelling string music]</i>

38:03.714 --> 38:05.424
W-why would you do that?

38:07.134 --> 38:08.752
Because he's my kid,

38:08.753 --> 38:10.804
and he really wants to come home,

38:10.805 --> 38:13.589
and he said that he'd continue
working with Dr. Edwards.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.033
Pineview's not close.

38:19.146 --> 38:21.597
So I'll have to drive him.

38:24.402 --> 38:25.852
Thanks for discussing it with me.

38:25.853 --> 38:27.854
Alex, please. Please, please, please.

38:27.855 --> 38:29.689
Don't be mad at me. Please?

38:29.690 --> 38:31.858
You can't be mad. I can't stand it.

38:31.859 --> 38:34.694
I can't stand... please don't be mad.

38:34.695 --> 38:36.663
Please?

38:36.664 --> 38:39.032
I just couldn't tell my own
son he couldn't come home.

38:39.033 --> 38:41.167
He was desperate. He was
begging me. He's my son.

38:41.168 --> 38:42.786
- What could I do?
- No, I understand.

38:42.787 --> 38:45.171
He found out we're married too.
That's... that's a part of it.

38:45.172 --> 38:46.756
He was so vulnerable. So scared.

38:46.757 --> 38:49.092
I... I had to tell him that
it was just for the insurance.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.594
- Norma.
- I know. I know it's stupid,

38:50.595 --> 38:52.262
but I just couldn't
tell him in the moment.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.381
I j... I was afraid that it
would undo all of the progress

38:54.382 --> 38:56.883
that he's done, so I will tell him...

38:56.884 --> 38:59.468
soon. Okay? But just not right away.

39:03.858 --> 39:05.392
I've screwed everything up.

39:05.393 --> 39:07.777
- No, no.
- Yeah, I have.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.313
You brought me a big, beautiful
TV. I've just screwed it up.

39:10.314 --> 39:12.866
No, no. No, you haven't.

39:12.867 --> 39:15.068
You did what you thought
was the right thing, okay?

39:15.069 --> 39:18.560
You're a mother. I'm not.
I've never been a parent.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.961
We're gonna get through this. Okay?

39:24.962 --> 39:27.797
And I'm going to help you.
And I'm going to help Norman.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.467
He's never had a decent
father figure in his life.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.636
He just... he needs to adjust.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.554
Okay? You did the right thing.

39:34.555 --> 39:36.139
He's your son. I'm not trying
to get in the way of that.

- Yes.
