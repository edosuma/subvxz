00:54.479 --> 00:56.401
We've got Osaka police
covering the perimeter,

00:56.402 --> 00:58.903
but our best bet is to
take the target down on site.

00:58.937 --> 01:00.655
Make no mistake,
he will be armed

01:00.689 --> 01:02.824
and he will do whatever it takes
to avoid capture,

01:02.858 --> 01:05.443
even if that means
using civilians for cover.

01:05.494 --> 01:07.728
Gentlemen, I've been hunting
this man for two years now.

01:07.746 --> 01:09.030
I can tell you
with the utmost

01:09.064 --> 01:11.499
certainty that he would rather
die than be taken alive.

01:11.533 --> 01:13.534
We got one
shot at this.

01:13.568 --> 01:16.587
Everybody good to go?

01:18.791 --> 01:20.074
Let's move.

01:28.417 --> 01:29.384
On the floor right now!

01:29.418 --> 01:31.769
Show me your hands!

01:33.422 --> 01:35.473
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:35.524 --> 01:38.860
Get on the floor.
Get on the floor.

01:39.812 --> 01:41.312
Clear!

01:41.363 --> 01:42.697
Cuff him.
Bedroom's clear.

01:42.731 --> 01:44.699
I've been expecting you,
McGarrett.

01:47.102 --> 01:48.436
All clear.

01:48.454 --> 01:50.455
But there's something back there
you need to see, Commander.

02:12.811 --> 02:14.645
Who was that?

02:14.680 --> 02:16.297
Huh?

02:16.315 --> 02:17.298
Was that Shelburne?

02:17.316 --> 02:19.133
Who'd you kill,
you son of a bitch?!

You don't have to be at

Adam.

04:40.492 --> 04:43.444
You don't have
to go yet, right?

04:49.635 --> 04:50.718
What's wrong?

04:50.752 --> 04:52.620
Well, you're about to head
into a meeting.

04:54.506 --> 04:57.575
What was I supposed to say,
I'm in bed with a cop?

05:00.795 --> 05:02.930
No.

05:03.798 --> 05:05.299
We can't even go out to dinner.

05:05.317 --> 05:08.069
And we have to sneak off
to a hotel

05:08.103 --> 05:09.437
every time we want
to be together.

05:09.471 --> 05:11.856
Look, you got
a better idea?

05:11.907 --> 05:13.908
I mean, I don't
see you, uh,

05:13.942 --> 05:16.160
rushing to tell
Chin about us.

05:16.194 --> 05:18.996
Or Five-O.
I want to.

05:19.031 --> 05:21.949
But you don't.

05:21.983 --> 05:24.168
Because you know
they'd look at me

05:24.202 --> 05:26.621
and see one thing:

05:26.655 --> 05:30.091
Hiro Noshimuri's son.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.360
Heir apparent to the head
of the Yakuza.

05:33.828 --> 05:36.681
They won't see that
if you're clean.

05:36.715 --> 05:38.549
I'm getting there.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.303
Our hotels on the North Shore
are entirely legit now.

05:42.337 --> 05:44.555
But it doesn't
happen overnight.

05:44.606 --> 05:48.225
I have to take it one
business at a time.

05:48.276 --> 05:51.445
I know.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.197
I just want to be with you.

05:53.231 --> 05:55.650
I want that, too.

06:10.749 --> 06:12.133
<i>Sumi masen.</i>

06:12.167 --> 06:15.052
I want that blood run through
every database you can find.

06:17.339 --> 06:19.390
Sasaki, there was a phone.

06:19.424 --> 06:20.925
I saw it on the table
when we made entry.

06:20.976 --> 06:22.059
We got it.

06:22.094 --> 06:24.729
Hey, guys, the phone
that was on the table?

06:27.516 --> 06:28.683
It's a burner.

06:28.717 --> 06:30.685
All right.

06:58.430 --> 07:00.581
Detective Williams.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.752
Hello. Detective Williams.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.053
Long time, partner.

07:06.087 --> 07:08.272
What the hell
is the matter with you?!

07:08.306 --> 07:09.590
Where the hell have you been?

07:09.608 --> 07:11.058
Been looking for Joe
and Shelburne.

07:11.092 --> 07:12.526
Didn't you get my letter?
I explained.

07:12.561 --> 07:13.761
No, no, no,
you didn't explain.

07:13.779 --> 07:14.979
You didn't explain anything.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.897
You just left me a letter,
and then you took off.

07:16.931 --> 07:18.115
Okay, I didn't take off.

07:18.150 --> 07:19.950
You're making it sound like
I was on the run. Why you angry?

07:19.985 --> 07:21.318
I'm not angry.

07:21.369 --> 07:22.369
Oh, you sound angry.

07:22.404 --> 07:24.271
I'm not angry, okay?
I was worried,

07:24.289 --> 07:25.740
and now I'm concerned.

07:25.774 --> 07:26.676
That's all.

07:26.701 --> 07:28.901
Okay. Well, uh, I appreciate
your concern.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.128
Thank you, but I'm fine.

07:31.163 --> 07:32.780
Well, you don't sound fine,
okay?

07:32.798 --> 07:34.114
You sound like
you're stressed out.

07:34.132 --> 07:35.132
Tell me something.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.834
Did you find Joe?

07:37.969 --> 07:39.953
No. But I think
I might've found Shelburne.

07:39.971 --> 07:42.289
What do you mean "you think"?
You either found him

07:42.307 --> 07:43.742
or you did not find him.
It's one or the other.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.458
It's complicated.

07:44.459 --> 07:45.760
All right with the secrecy.

07:45.794 --> 07:46.960
Okay? I don't need it
right now.

07:46.978 --> 07:48.679
I mean, did you just call me
to not tell me

07:48.730 --> 07:49.930
what's going on with you?

07:49.964 --> 07:51.599
No. I called you to tell you
that I'm in Osaka

07:51.633 --> 07:52.850
and I have Wo Fat in custody.

07:52.901 --> 07:54.018
All right?

07:54.069 --> 07:55.102
You...

07:55.136 --> 07:56.604
Way to bury the lead, buddy.

07:56.638 --> 07:57.772
Danny,

07:57.806 --> 07:59.640
I know that I owe all of you
an explanation,

07:59.658 --> 08:00.691
and you're gonna get it, okay?

08:00.742 --> 08:02.810
But right now,
I need your help.

08:02.828 --> 08:04.311
Are Chin and Kono around?

08:04.329 --> 08:07.114
Yeah. Hold on, Steve.

08:10.652 --> 08:12.486
Steve's in Japan.
He needs our help.

08:12.504 --> 08:14.822
Oh, and as a side note,
he arrested Wo Fat.

08:15.757 --> 08:17.324
Go ahead.

08:17.359 --> 08:18.492
What do you need, Steve?

08:18.510 --> 08:20.327
We're worried about you.
Are you okay?

08:20.345 --> 08:22.663
I'm okay. I'll be home soon.

08:22.681 --> 08:24.164
And I'm bringing Wo Fat in.

08:24.182 --> 08:25.299
How'd you get him?

08:25.333 --> 08:26.884
I was in Osaka tracking
Shelburne

08:26.935 --> 08:28.536
when I heard chatter
about Wo Fat.

08:28.570 --> 08:30.003
So I coordinated with Interpol,

08:30.021 --> 08:33.173
got a lock on his location,
we executed a raid.

08:33.191 --> 08:34.942
Oh, you make it
sound very easy.

08:34.976 --> 08:35.842
It was too easy.

08:35.861 --> 08:37.193
That's what I don't like.

08:37.229 --> 08:38.729
Wo Fat surrendered himself.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.280
That's definitely
too easy.

08:40.315 --> 08:41.649
I found a phone.

08:41.683 --> 08:44.183
It was used to call a number
in Honolulu 17 times

08:44.202 --> 08:46.370
in two days-- I want to know
who he was calling.

08:46.404 --> 08:47.872
You have the number?

08:47.906 --> 08:50.324
808-555-0172.

08:53.528 --> 08:55.079
All right,
the phone's on,

08:55.113 --> 08:56.363
getting a signal.

08:57.465 --> 08:59.032
Looks like Kewalo Basin.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.301
Okay, we're all over it, babe.

09:00.335 --> 09:01.385
Just be careful, okay?

09:01.419 --> 09:02.837
I don't know what
Wo Fat's up to,

09:02.871 --> 09:04.171
but he wanted me
to find this phone.

09:04.205 --> 09:06.590
I don't want you
walking into an ambush.

09:06.641 --> 09:08.342
Hey, listen, we will be fine.
Just do me a favor:

09:08.376 --> 09:09.844
take care of your own six.

09:09.878 --> 09:12.062
Sorry, did you say "six"?

09:12.097 --> 09:14.047
Okay, I've been gone
way too long.

09:14.065 --> 09:15.549
You're starting
to sound like me.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.151
I know, I know, and it just
made me want to throw up.

09:17.185 --> 09:18.185
Can you hurry back, please?

09:18.219 --> 09:20.070
Yeah. Roger that.

09:34.953 --> 09:37.204
We've got a body.

09:49.050 --> 09:50.384
Phone's still on her.

09:50.418 --> 09:52.586
Looks like she was
the one Wo Fat was calling.

09:54.105 --> 09:55.639
She got a shot off.

09:56.758 --> 09:58.943
Who is she?

10:00.428 --> 10:01.645
Anna Douglas.

10:01.696 --> 10:02.980
Look at that.

10:03.031 --> 10:05.649
She worked
for the State Department.

10:05.684 --> 10:06.767
So, what is she doing

10:06.785 --> 10:07.935
taking calls from Wo Fat?

10:07.953 --> 10:09.954
She was dirty.
Either that,

10:09.988 --> 10:11.322
or the United States
government's

10:11.373 --> 10:13.273
been doing business
with an international fugitive.

10:41.620 --> 10:42.895
Danny, what do you got?

10:42.896 --> 10:43.978
We followed up
the phone calls

10:43.979 --> 10:44.841
that Wo Fat was making.

10:44.842 --> 10:45.859
We found a dead woman

10:45.894 --> 10:47.194
with State Department
credentials.

10:47.228 --> 10:49.263
Her name is Anna Douglas,

10:49.297 --> 10:51.899
and apparently she worked
for Cultural Affairs.

10:51.950 --> 10:53.650
Out of D.C.?

10:53.684 --> 10:55.518
Yeah. Uh, the body's on the way
to Max right now.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.204
Kono and Chin
are gonna follow up.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.322
What was she doing in Hawaii?

10:58.356 --> 10:59.740
I don't know;
I have no idea.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.159
I put a call in to TSA;
they said in the past year,

11:02.193 --> 11:04.194
she's travelled to Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Iraq.

11:04.212 --> 11:06.797
Sounds more like CIA
than Cultural Affairs.

11:06.831 --> 11:08.248
Yeah, I was figuring
the same thing.

11:08.299 --> 11:10.584
Why would Wo Fat be in contact
with a CIA agent?

11:10.635 --> 11:11.701
I have no idea, but the CIA

11:11.719 --> 11:13.086
has a field office here;
I'm gonna

11:13.137 --> 11:14.838
head over to
the Federal Building in a minute

11:14.872 --> 11:16.473
and find out.
All right, keep me posted.

11:16.507 --> 11:17.808
All right, so, uh,

11:17.842 --> 11:20.344
what's up; you get a chance
to interrogate Wo Fat yet?

11:20.378 --> 11:22.229
Sorry, Danny, that's classified.

11:22.263 --> 11:24.147
It's classified?

11:24.182 --> 11:25.532
Is that a joke?
Are you kidding me?

11:25.567 --> 11:26.900
No, I'm not kidding.

11:26.935 --> 11:28.151
Okay, uh, well,

11:28.186 --> 11:29.353
when are you bringing him back?

11:29.387 --> 11:31.221
I can't tell you that either,
Danny; I can't

11:31.239 --> 11:33.190
tell you these things over an
unsecured line, you understand?

11:33.224 --> 11:34.274
It's a security issue.

11:34.325 --> 11:35.642
Okay, you know what I think?

11:35.677 --> 11:38.779
I think that you think that
saying stuff like that is cool.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.197
It's not cool;
it's actually the opposite

11:40.231 --> 11:41.248
of cool. You know what?
Danny...

11:41.282 --> 11:42.583
Forget it.
I don't care when...

11:42.617 --> 11:43.784
Well, no, I care.

11:43.835 --> 11:45.285
I'm just gonna
find out myself, okay?

11:45.336 --> 11:46.336
I will track your plane.

11:46.371 --> 11:49.339
No, you won't.
We're coming in dark.

11:50.425 --> 11:51.425
Dark, huh?

11:51.459 --> 11:53.076
Yes, dark,
as in off the radar, dark.

11:53.111 --> 11:54.911
I-I know what dark means, okay?

11:54.929 --> 11:56.263
Is that really necessary,
though?

11:56.297 --> 11:58.015
It's protocol, Danny;
I'm sorry but I can't

11:58.049 --> 11:59.716
answer your questions right now.
Okay, I got to go.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.051
Well, I got an easy one.
All right?

12:01.085 --> 12:02.552
What are you wearing?

12:02.586 --> 12:03.586
You know what, don't answer it.

12:03.605 --> 12:04.805
I'm sure it's top secret,

12:04.856 --> 12:06.473
so I will take a guess.

12:06.524 --> 12:08.609
Cargo pants.

12:08.643 --> 12:11.378
Good-bye, Daniel.

12:19.954 --> 12:23.557
I know we were both in Osaka
looking for the same thing.

12:25.609 --> 12:27.728
Is that who was in the bathtub?

12:30.882 --> 12:34.818
Unfortunately, Shelburne
continues to elude us both.

12:36.754 --> 12:38.955
Is that right?

12:38.973 --> 12:42.059
What about Anna Douglas?

12:42.844 --> 12:44.761
She's dead, isn't she?

12:44.795 --> 12:45.929
You know she is.

12:45.964 --> 12:49.132
Question is why would you
have a CIA agent killed?

12:50.735 --> 12:52.469
What was she to you?

12:54.405 --> 12:58.425
Let's just say Agent Douglas
is the reason you're here.

13:00.745 --> 13:03.296
Hey, Max, I got
your message.

13:03.331 --> 13:05.115
Find anything interesting?

13:05.149 --> 13:06.650
My finding are always
of interest to me.

13:06.684 --> 13:07.668
Few people comprehend

13:07.702 --> 13:09.036
the confessional nature
of autopsies.

13:09.087 --> 13:12.322
They allow the body to reveal
a treasure trove of secrets

13:12.340 --> 13:15.459
even when the cause of death
appears to be quite evident.

13:15.493 --> 13:18.545
Is that your way of saying a
bullet didn't kill Anna Douglas?

13:18.596 --> 13:20.830
What?
No, even the untrained eye

13:20.848 --> 13:22.132
can see the cause of death

13:22.166 --> 13:23.717
was a gunshot wound
to the frontal lobe.

13:23.768 --> 13:25.268
Max,

13:25.303 --> 13:26.520
why are we here?

13:26.554 --> 13:28.605
Because of this.

13:30.525 --> 13:33.560
It's the bullet that I extracted
from the victim.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.196
What about it?

13:36.230 --> 13:38.222
Notice the gold-colored flakes
around the tip.

13:38.449 --> 13:39.449
Do you think
it was a custom load?

13:39.484 --> 13:40.517
Quite possibly.

13:40.535 --> 13:41.902
I haven't heard
of anyone

13:41.953 --> 13:43.487
on the Island using gold.
Yeah, neither have I.

13:43.521 --> 13:45.622
Unfortunately,
this is

13:45.656 --> 13:46.856
beyond my area of expertise.

13:46.874 --> 13:49.025
However, I do know someone
who is quite familiar

13:49.043 --> 13:50.293
with the current
ballistic trends

13:50.328 --> 13:51.561
among the criminal element.

13:51.596 --> 13:53.096
You do?

13:58.136 --> 14:01.755
I appreciate your position,
Detective Williams,

14:01.806 --> 14:04.707
but I'm afraid
I can neither conform nor deny

14:04.726 --> 14:06.476
Miss Douglas's affiliation

14:06.511 --> 14:07.844
with the agency.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.930
You appreciate my position?

14:09.981 --> 14:11.581
Is that, uh, is that a joke?

14:11.616 --> 14:12.566
Now,

14:12.600 --> 14:13.934
if there's nothing else...

14:13.985 --> 14:15.018
No, no, no, there is

14:15.052 --> 14:16.219
something else,

14:16.237 --> 14:17.571
Agent Kendricks, I am not done.

14:17.605 --> 14:19.689
All right, I am
investigating a homicide.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.074
I don't know if
you heard me,

14:21.109 --> 14:22.559
but one of your agents
has been murdered.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.861
I can't help you, Detective.

14:26.581 --> 14:27.864
Okay, listen,  uh,

14:27.898 --> 14:30.333
I know about the plane
that's coming in dark.

14:30.368 --> 14:32.452
A plane coming in dark?

14:32.503 --> 14:35.705
You do realize those only exist
in spy thrillers, right?

14:35.739 --> 14:38.258
Oh, no, I know for a fact
that they exist in real life

14:38.292 --> 14:39.793
along with black helicopters.

14:39.844 --> 14:41.595
Those exist, too.

14:41.629 --> 14:44.914
Hey, hey, hey,
listen to me.

14:44.932 --> 14:47.584
Whether or not you care
to acknowledge it,

14:47.635 --> 14:49.970
the fact is
Anna Douglas was murdered.

14:50.021 --> 14:51.772
And I can't figure out
why you don't want to help

14:51.806 --> 14:52.939
me find the person
who did it.

14:52.974 --> 14:55.725
Are you going to leave
on your own,

14:55.759 --> 14:57.494
or do I need to call security?

14:59.063 --> 15:00.864
You know, I, uh,
I can also take this

15:00.898 --> 15:02.399
to the governor's office,
if you'd like.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.117
Oh, you do that.
Okay.

15:04.152 --> 15:05.569
The press, I'm sure that

15:05.603 --> 15:07.988
they'd like to hear
about something like this.

15:13.411 --> 15:14.327
Detective Williams,

15:14.378 --> 15:15.445
you need to leave.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.330
Now.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.749
That's security?

15:21.636 --> 15:23.620
Okay.

15:53.784 --> 15:54.701
Hey,

15:54.752 --> 15:56.286
why are we landing?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.821
We're still 50 miles
out of Honolulu.

15:57.855 --> 15:59.372
Please take your
seat, Commander.

15:59.423 --> 16:00.590
No, what the hell is going on?

16:00.625 --> 16:02.042
Why are we landing this plane?

16:02.093 --> 16:02.959
Commander McGarrett,
sit down.

16:02.993 --> 16:04.678
Everything okay,
Commander?

16:04.712 --> 16:06.179
Yeah, it's fi...

17:39.161 --> 17:42.113
♪ ♪

18:27.543 --> 18:29.578
♪ ♪

18:54.756 --> 18:57.524
Hey,

18:57.559 --> 18:59.810
you, uh, you the one
who sent me that text?

18:59.811 --> 19:01.946
Yes.
Oh.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.515
Okay, not exactly
what I was expecting.

19:04.533 --> 19:05.533
Really?

19:05.567 --> 19:08.486
You want 007,
you got to see a movie.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.239
You want information, I'm afraid
you're stuck with me, kid.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.708
Okay, fair enough.

19:13.742 --> 19:16.210
Uh, who are you and what
are you doing here?

19:16.245 --> 19:18.329
Let's just say
I'm a friend in the CIA.

19:18.363 --> 19:19.530
A friend?

19:19.548 --> 19:21.916
Okay, that still doesn't
answer my questions.

19:21.967 --> 19:23.417
Well, it's the only answer
you're gonna get.

19:23.468 --> 19:24.919
Now, do you want information
about Wo Fat

19:24.970 --> 19:26.220
and Agent Douglas or not?

19:26.255 --> 19:29.223
Yes, so Anna Douglas was CIA?
Yes.

19:29.258 --> 19:31.008
She was working with Wo Fat.

19:31.042 --> 19:33.811
Working with Wo Fat how?

19:33.845 --> 19:36.347
Wo Fat has a long history
with the CIA.

19:36.381 --> 19:38.566
He does?

19:38.600 --> 19:41.402
Over the past 15 years,
Wo Fat has negotiated

19:41.436 --> 19:44.888
arms deals between the U.S.
and certain organizations.

19:44.906 --> 19:47.441
Organizations
that we've since disavowed.

19:47.492 --> 19:49.560
That's great.

19:49.595 --> 19:50.778
That's amazing.

19:50.829 --> 19:53.914
The CIA is in bed with
a murderous psychopath,

19:53.949 --> 19:56.784
whose body count includes
the governor of Hawaii.

19:56.818 --> 19:58.736
Hindsight is twenty-twenty.

19:58.770 --> 20:01.639
You got to understand,
foreign policy

20:01.673 --> 20:04.041
is a game of shifting alliances.

20:04.075 --> 20:07.428
Sometimes, you get into bed
with people you shouldn't.

20:07.462 --> 20:08.579
That's good.

20:08.597 --> 20:09.930
So, now what?

20:09.965 --> 20:11.849
He has information.

20:11.883 --> 20:13.968
The people he can bring down
are powerful.

20:14.019 --> 20:15.886
They'd rather him kept quiet.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.973
Agent Douglas was his handler
within the agency.

20:19.024 --> 20:20.391
Handler? What
does that mean?

20:20.425 --> 20:23.327
It means she can make all
the charges against him go away.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.648
So, what, she's his get
out of jail free card?

20:27.699 --> 20:28.783
Exactly.

20:28.817 --> 20:30.868
Then why would he
have her killed?

20:30.902 --> 20:32.320
He may not have killed her.

20:32.371 --> 20:34.572
He may have gotten her killed.

20:34.606 --> 20:36.106
Meaning the wrong person
found out

20:36.124 --> 20:38.075
that she was helping him out.
Maybe.

20:38.110 --> 20:39.994
The only thing I'm certain

20:40.045 --> 20:42.079
is that it's not just
a coincidence

20:42.113 --> 20:45.049
that Agent Douglas wound up
with a bullet in her head

20:45.116 --> 20:48.619
on the same day that Wo Fat
was being extradited from Japan.

20:48.654 --> 20:50.221
I agree.

20:50.255 --> 20:51.789
Listen, if this
thing is going down,

20:51.807 --> 20:54.342
I need to know when and
where that plane is landing.

20:54.393 --> 20:56.727
Now, can you track it?
Can you help me with that?

20:56.762 --> 20:59.730
I can't promise anything.

20:59.765 --> 21:01.565
Plane is coming in dark,
but I'll try.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

21:03.134 --> 21:05.436
how do I get in touch with you?
You don't.

21:12.444 --> 21:14.111
Where were you
last night, cuz?

21:14.145 --> 21:15.145
I called you twice.

21:15.163 --> 21:16.497
What are you, my father?

21:16.531 --> 21:17.665
Things are getting serious

21:17.699 --> 21:19.316
between you and this new guy,
aren't they?

21:19.334 --> 21:21.035
You ever gonna
introduce us?

21:21.086 --> 21:22.503
Yeah, one of these days.

21:22.537 --> 21:23.704
Excuse me.

21:23.755 --> 21:25.406
Can you tell us
where to find Charlie?

21:26.591 --> 21:29.159
Thanks.

21:30.095 --> 21:31.595
Hey, excuse me, Charlie?

21:31.630 --> 21:33.330
I'm Charlie. Can I help you?

21:33.348 --> 21:35.165
Yeah.

21:35.183 --> 21:36.217
Our friend Max

21:36.268 --> 21:37.435
told us you might be able

21:37.469 --> 21:38.719
to answer a couple questions
for us.

21:38.770 --> 21:40.221
Max should know better
than to send

21:40.272 --> 21:41.806
a couple of cops to talk to me.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.674
Yeah, well, we're actually
just looking

21:43.692 --> 21:45.443
for a little information.

21:45.477 --> 21:47.778
What's this?
We were hoping you could tell us.

21:47.813 --> 21:49.146
We pulled that slug

21:49.180 --> 21:50.865
out of a woman's head.

21:50.899 --> 21:51.649
See the gold bits?

21:51.683 --> 21:52.683
We're wondering if you

21:52.701 --> 21:54.017
know where
a custom load like that

21:54.035 --> 21:54.952
might come from.

21:54.986 --> 21:56.120
Well, it's not
a custom load.

21:56.154 --> 21:58.689
It's a custom piece,
gold-plated.

21:58.707 --> 22:00.541
The gold flakes are
from the barrel--

22:00.575 --> 22:02.626
they shoot out with the load.
Who's using them?

22:02.661 --> 22:04.662
Most people don't use them;
they're just for show.

22:04.696 --> 22:06.380
Gold-plated handguns
have become

22:06.415 --> 22:08.749
popular tokens of appreciation

22:08.800 --> 22:12.420
within a certain segment
of our Asian population.

22:12.471 --> 22:14.538
Can you be more specific?

22:14.556 --> 22:17.975
The Yakuza.

22:20.979 --> 22:22.730
Doesn't make
any sense.

22:22.764 --> 22:24.765
The Yakuza hasn't been
in bed with Wo Fat

22:24.800 --> 22:26.717
since before Hiro
Noshimuri disappeared.

22:26.735 --> 22:29.219
Things change.

22:29.237 --> 22:30.771
What are you doing?

22:30.806 --> 22:32.440
Calling Danny.
I'm gonna let him know

22:32.474 --> 22:34.642
we're gonna pay
Adam Noshimuri a visit.

23:05.557 --> 23:07.641
Get up! Get up!

23:07.692 --> 23:11.779
They're coming for you,
aren't they?

23:12.764 --> 23:15.950
That's not gonna happen.

23:15.984 --> 23:17.267
Let's go.

23:17.285 --> 23:18.886
Now.

23:29.581 --> 23:31.215
Go.

23:37.637 --> 23:39.271
<i>My client is</i>
<i>a legitimate businessman.</i>

23:39.305 --> 23:42.090
I'm sure Mr. Noshimuri
has an alibi

23:42.124 --> 23:43.475
for the time
of the murder.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.559
I'm sure he does.

23:44.594 --> 23:46.011
But everyone in
this room knows

23:46.062 --> 23:48.396
his business is anything
but legitimate.

23:48.431 --> 23:49.998
You are fishing,
Lieutenant.

23:50.032 --> 23:52.601
Your client is
the acting head of the Yakuza

23:52.635 --> 23:53.568
on the island.

23:53.603 --> 23:54.736
We have evidence
that Agent Douglas

23:54.770 --> 23:56.037
was murdered
with a Yakuza weapon.

23:56.072 --> 23:57.022
That makes you

23:57.073 --> 23:59.157
a person of interest.

23:59.191 --> 24:00.659
You seem to have me confused

24:00.693 --> 24:02.027
with my father,
Lieutenant Kelly.

24:02.078 --> 24:05.146
Even if what you
believe is true,

24:05.164 --> 24:07.415
why would Mr. Noshimuri
want to kill a CIA agent?

24:07.450 --> 24:09.084
To score points
with Wo Fat.

24:09.118 --> 24:10.919
Wo Fat is the last person

24:10.953 --> 24:12.420
Hiro's son
would take orders from.

24:12.455 --> 24:15.423
Look, it's no secret

24:15.458 --> 24:17.375
that Wo Fat wanted
your father dead.

24:17.426 --> 24:19.177
It's what drove him
to fake his own death

24:19.211 --> 24:20.712
and go into hiding
in the first place.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.431
Wo Fat came to you
with a proposition:

24:23.466 --> 24:25.550
you order a Yakuza
hit on a CIA agent,

24:25.601 --> 24:29.020
and, in exchange, your father
gets to come out of hiding.

24:29.055 --> 24:32.140
That's quite a theory.

24:32.174 --> 24:36.778
But despite what you believe,
the truth is, my father's dead.

24:36.812 --> 24:40.448
You're a good liar,
I'll give you that.

24:40.483 --> 24:42.517
Apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

24:42.568 --> 24:43.485
Okay, that's enough.

24:43.519 --> 24:44.703
You've had your fun. Let's go.

24:44.737 --> 24:47.455
It's time to harass
somebody else.

24:48.908 --> 24:50.959
What, you hurt yourself,
Mr. Lansing?

24:50.993 --> 24:52.377
Let me help you
with that.

24:53.963 --> 24:55.246
Good-bye, Lieutenant.

24:58.867 --> 25:01.836
Did you see that?

25:01.870 --> 25:04.589
The way Lansing moved
when we were leaving?

25:04.640 --> 25:05.840
Not really, no.

25:05.874 --> 25:08.143
He winced when he reached
out to open the door.

25:08.177 --> 25:09.544
Okay, so he winced.
Big deal.

25:09.562 --> 25:11.730
Come on, you can do better
than that. He's injured.

25:11.764 --> 25:13.732
Remember the shell
casing at the scene?

25:13.766 --> 25:15.000
Agent Douglas
fired her weapon.

25:15.034 --> 25:16.234
She clipped him.

25:16.268 --> 25:19.938
Lansing isn't a triggerman,
Chin, he's a lawyer.

25:19.989 --> 25:21.489
No, he's a
Yakuza enforcer

25:21.524 --> 25:23.891
with a fancy suit
and a law degree.

25:23.909 --> 25:25.493
Everything that
I've heard is that

25:25.528 --> 25:27.612
Adam Noshimuri
is working to clean up

25:27.663 --> 25:28.780
the family's holdings.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.115
You don't really believe that,
do you, Kono?

25:30.166 --> 25:33.251
Don't be fooled by
the Ivy League front.

25:33.285 --> 25:35.503
Just because
Hiro Noshimuri is capable

25:35.538 --> 25:38.790
of murdering a CIA agent,
it doesn't mean that Adam is.

25:42.962 --> 25:44.262

defending him?

25:44.296 --> 25:46.264
I'm not.

25:46.298 --> 25:48.883

jumping to conclusions.

25:51.354 --> 25:52.437
Steve, it's me, again.

25:52.471 --> 25:54.856
Please call me back
as soon as you get this.

25:54.890 --> 25:56.074
Huh?

25:56.108 --> 25:58.810

You're pretty chatty

26:23.102 --> 26:26.221
Shelburne murdered
my father.

26:26.255 --> 26:28.790
Ah, well, you sanctioned
my father's execution,

26:28.808 --> 26:30.508
so I know exactly
how you feel.

26:30.543 --> 26:33.094
Then why don't you kill me?

26:34.980 --> 26:36.898
Keep moving.

26:47.576 --> 26:49.194
Keep moving.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.235
Whoa.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.038
Let's go.

27:00.089 --> 27:01.322
Go!

27:22.228 --> 27:24.863
Okay.

27:24.897 --> 27:26.514
What am I doing here?

27:26.532 --> 27:29.117
You're being advised
that the investigation

27:29.151 --> 27:31.185
into Agent Douglas's death
is closed.

27:31.203 --> 27:32.904
"Agent Douglas."

27:32.955 --> 27:35.373
Okay, so you admit
that she is CIA.

27:35.407 --> 27:36.991
That's a moot point.
Her body's gone.

27:37.025 --> 27:38.960
It's gone?

27:38.994 --> 27:40.545
What do you mean, it's gone?

27:40.579 --> 27:42.196
Disappeared.

27:42.214 --> 27:44.966
Like the shell casing
you found at the scene,

27:45.000 --> 27:48.136
the autopsy report--
everything.

27:48.170 --> 27:50.889
This case is closed
because it was never opened

27:50.923 --> 27:51.973
to begin with.

27:52.007 --> 27:53.341
Oh.

27:53.375 --> 27:54.592
Okay.

27:54.643 --> 27:56.427
Do you think
I'm just gonna go along

27:56.479 --> 27:57.479
with that, genius?

27:57.513 --> 27:58.563
You don't have a choice.

27:58.597 --> 28:01.399
Yes, yes, I do have a choice.

28:01.433 --> 28:02.734
Okay, more importantly
than that,

28:02.769 --> 28:04.636
how do you
group of morons

28:04.671 --> 28:06.638
think that you're
gonna keep this quiet

28:06.673 --> 28:07.973
when Wo Fat gets here, huh?

28:08.007 --> 28:10.475
What makes you think
anyone's bringing him in?

28:10.509 --> 28:12.943
Because I know for a fact that
he's on a plane right now.

28:12.978 --> 28:16.681
Yeah, well,
that plane doesn't exist.

28:21.219 --> 28:22.953
Listen to me.

28:22.988 --> 28:26.290
Uh, if anything happens
to that plane,

28:26.324 --> 28:31.294
I promise you, I'm find you
and I'm gonna kill you, okay?

28:32.830 --> 28:34.931
Don't be ridiculous.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.432
We're the good guys.

28:36.466 --> 28:39.535
Yeah, you're the good guys.

good guys? Huh?

Hey.

29:15.069 --> 29:16.569
Why did you ask me to come here?

29:16.604 --> 29:18.605
I didn't want
anyone to see us.

29:18.639 --> 29:21.041
We need to talk.

29:21.075 --> 29:22.876
Yeah, I'm sorry about today.

29:22.910 --> 29:24.344
I didn't know what to do.

29:24.378 --> 29:26.079
I know.

29:26.114 --> 29:28.849
Look, I need you to believe that

29:28.883 --> 29:31.150
I didn't have anything to do
with that murder.

29:31.184 --> 29:32.618
I want to believe you.

29:32.652 --> 29:34.019
I didn't order it,

29:34.054 --> 29:36.222
and none of my people would've
acted without my consent.

29:36.256 --> 29:37.223
Are you sure?

29:37.257 --> 29:39.125
What about Lansing?

29:39.159 --> 29:41.593
Ted? No.

29:41.628 --> 29:43.195
No, he...

29:43.230 --> 29:45.631
No, he was loyal to my father
and he's loyal to me.

29:45.665 --> 29:47.265
He would never do
something like that.

29:47.299 --> 29:50.268
It's just...

29:50.302 --> 29:52.203
if Wo Fat offered you a trade--

29:52.238 --> 29:56.440
the CIA agent
for your father--

29:56.475 --> 29:59.477
I need to know.

29:59.511 --> 30:00.812
I told your cousin,

30:00.846 --> 30:04.915
and I'll tell you--
my father is dead.

30:04.949 --> 30:06.583
I know he's in hiding.

30:06.617 --> 30:08.118
I know he faked his death.

30:08.153 --> 30:09.086
You don't know.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.453
Adam, don't lie to me.

30:10.488 --> 30:12.022
I'm not here as a cop.

30:12.056 --> 30:14.024
I'm here because
I care about you.

30:14.058 --> 30:16.559
It's not a lie!

30:20.497 --> 30:22.498
Look in the box.

30:22.532 --> 30:24.667
Just-just look
in the box.

30:36.913 --> 30:38.814
Oh, my God.

30:41.918 --> 30:45.287
There were five more boxes
just like that.

30:47.056 --> 30:49.490
Different pieces.

30:49.525 --> 30:52.526
Wo Fat sent them to me.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.494
And you're sure it's...

30:56.264 --> 30:58.299
Oh, Adam.

30:59.500 --> 31:03.537
My father-- he stopped
taking orders from Wo Fat

31:03.571 --> 31:08.007
and paid with his life.

31:08.042 --> 31:10.476
Now you understand...

31:10.510 --> 31:14.513
the Yakuza is not in league
with Wo Fat.
