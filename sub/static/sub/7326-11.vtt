WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:06.677
(beeping)

00:06.677 --> 00:10.111
(Meredith) EVERY DOCTOR HAS
A DIRTY LITTLE SECRET--

00:10.111 --> 00:12.783
WE'RE ALL
COMPETITIVE SCIENCE NERDS.

00:12.783 --> 00:14.385
IN GRADE SCHOOL...

00:14.385 --> 00:16.347
(whirring
WE MADE THE BIGGEST
AND BEST VOLCANOES,

00:16.347 --> 00:20.251
WHICH ERUPTED
ACTUAL FAKE MOLTEN LAVAL.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.622
IN JUNIOR HIGH,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.755
WE SPENT HOURS LABORING OVER
OUR RAT MAZES...

00:24.755 --> 00:27.358
THE COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC IS
COMPLETE. EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT.

00:27.358 --> 00:28.759
FINISHED THE ROBOTIC PROSTHETIC
INSPECTION.

00:28.759 --> 00:30.101
IT'S ALL IN ORDER.

00:30.101 --> 00:33.464
SO... WE'RE READY TO TRY AGAIN?

00:33.464 --> 00:35.566
LET'S GET HER CONNECTED.
OKAY.

00:35.566 --> 00:36.737
OKAY.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.369
EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT...

00:38.369 --> 00:40.241
(device clicks)
I FEEL LIKE
THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.372
SO THAT ONE DAY...

00:41.372 --> 00:43.174
(device clicks)
WE'D BE THE PERSON

00:43.174 --> 00:44.815
WHO CHANGED
THE FACE OF MEDICINE....
(clippers whirring)

00:44.815 --> 00:47.278
FOREVER.
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

00:47.278 --> 00:50.281
YOUR FIRST PRINTED PORTAL VEIN
IS GOING INTO A TEST SUBJECT.

00:50.281 --> 00:51.382
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:51.382 --> 00:54.125
LIKE A FARMHAND
BEHIND THE BACK BARN.

00:54.125 --> 00:57.228
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OVER
THE CLIPPERS?
(whirring stops)

00:57.228 --> 00:58.659
LOOK AT US.
(whirring resumes)

00:58.659 --> 01:01.492
CHANGING THE FACE OF MEDICINE,
SHEARING A SHEEP.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.494
NO, I WAS SHEARING A SHEEP.

01:03.494 --> 01:05.436
YOU ARE JUST GIVING HIM
A FADE.

01:05.436 --> 01:07.298
THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.

01:07.298 --> 01:10.201
LOOK AT US. WE'RE CHANGING
THE FACE OF MEDICINE.

01:10.201 --> 01:12.303
(chuckles)

01:12.303 --> 01:14.305
OH! (sighs)
(laughs)

01:14.305 --> 01:16.107
WOW. THAT WAS...

01:16.107 --> 01:18.209
YOU REALLY KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:18.209 --> 01:19.610
ARE YOU GRADING ME?

01:19.610 --> 01:21.582
MAYBE I AM, A LITTLE.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.753
MMM.

01:22.753 --> 01:24.115
YOU'RE GETTIN' AN "A."

01:24.115 --> 01:26.187
I DON'T KNOW. I'M KIND OF
AN OVERACHIEVER.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.488
I'D LIKE TO GO FOR
THE "A"-PLUS.

01:27.488 --> 01:31.192
NO. WE HAVE A TON TO DO
BEFORE THE PROCEDURE TODAY.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.323
(sighs deeply) OKAY.

01:32.323 --> 01:34.165
THE CONDUIT'S
COMING OFF THE PRINTER IN...

01:34.165 --> 01:36.397
TWO HOURS, 47 MINUTES--

01:36.397 --> 01:39.099
WHICH GIVES US
ANOTHER 30 MINUTES

01:39.099 --> 01:40.801
BEFORE WE HAVE TO
START PREP.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.374
(kissing)
ALL RIGHT.

01:43.374 --> 01:44.535
MAYBE A LITTLE EXTRA CREDIT?

01:44.535 --> 01:46.307
AHH.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.778
HOW'S YOUR RESEARCH GOING?

01:47.778 --> 01:49.580
OH, THE DIAGNOSTICS LOOK GOOD.
I JUST SLIPPED OUT FOR A SEC.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.841
I DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS.

01:50.841 --> 01:53.244
MM. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE IT TO THE SHOWER?

01:53.244 --> 01:55.216
OH, CRAP. KEPNER'S SHOWER
IS TODAY?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.487
YEAH, IT'S TODAY.
(sighs deeply)

01:56.487 --> 01:58.289
AND SHE'S OUR FRIEND, SO...
I KNOW SHE'S OUR FRIEND.

01:58.289 --> 01:59.690
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
SHE'S OUR FRIEND.

01:59.690 --> 02:01.552
SORRY. WELL...
I JUST--I'LL BE THERE IF I CAN.

02:01.552 --> 02:03.123
GREAT.
GREAT.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.455
DR. ROBBINS. DR. TORRES

02:04.455 --> 02:05.626
(Arizona and Callie) DR. MURPHY.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.897
(elevator bell dings)

02:06.897 --> 02:08.128
THAT WAS GOOD.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.360
PROFESSIONAL. I BOUGHT IT.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.601
MM-HMM.

02:10.601 --> 02:12.233
YOU'RE DYING INSIDE,
AREN'T YOU?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.864
THERE'S STILL TWO SEATS LEFT
IN THE GALLERY. WHO WANTS THEM?

02:13.864 --> 02:15.306
I DO.
ME.

02:15.306 --> 02:16.667
WHOA. HEY, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT MY SURGERY?

02:16.667 --> 02:18.439
HERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.
IT'S JUST ME AND DR. GREY,

02:18.439 --> 02:20.341
AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST,
AND A VETERINARIAN.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.213
YOU LOST ME AT "VETERINARIAN."

02:22.213 --> 02:24.275
HE'S PUTTING A SEEDED CONDUIT
INTO A BABY.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.917
WHO IS HUMAN.
YOU ARE BOTHERING A SHEEP.

02:26.917 --> 02:28.649
PLUS, I'M ALLERGIC TO WOOL.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.251
I'M ALLERGIC
TO BORING SURGERIES.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.222
(Steph) WOW.
(elevator bell dings)

02:31.222 --> 02:32.553
(Owen sighs)

02:32.553 --> 02:34.755
HEY. BIG DAY.
IT IS.

02:34.755 --> 02:35.926
YOU GONNA WATCH?

02:35.926 --> 02:37.328
WATCH?

02:37.328 --> 02:39.360
CRISTINA'S SURGERY.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.661
I HAVE MY OWN.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.933
OH, YEAH. THE, UH, THE PIG.
SHEEP.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.435
THE SHEEP. YES. (chuckles)

02:44.435 --> 02:47.298
HEY. UH, HERE HE COMES.

02:51.542 --> 02:54.305
WHAT ARE ALL OF YOU
DOING HERE?

02:54.305 --> 02:55.706
WE CAME TO SEE YOU OFF.

02:55.706 --> 02:57.548
WE COULDN'T LET YOU LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

02:57.548 --> 02:58.709
WE'LL MISS YOU.

02:58.709 --> 03:01.252
I'M JUST GOING HOME.
I'M NOT RETIRING.

03:01.252 --> 03:04.755
BUT FIRST, I JUST NEED
A VACATION FROM ALL OF YOU.

03:04.755 --> 03:07.218
(all chuckle)

03:08.589 --> 03:10.221
YOU DID IT, SIR.

03:10.221 --> 03:12.363
YOU GOT YOURSELF BETTER.

03:12.363 --> 03:14.965
NO. YOU DID IT, BAILEY.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.497
(elevator bell dings)

03:16.497 --> 03:17.968
YOU GOT ME BETTER.

03:26.937 --> 03:30.281
(woman) IS DR. WEBBER LEAVING
VERY STRESSFUL FOR YOU?

03:30.281 --> 03:31.442
(telephone rings)

03:31.442 --> 03:32.943
NO.

03:32.943 --> 03:35.346
THEN WHY ARE YOU COUNTING
YOUR FINGERS?

03:35.346 --> 03:39.290
(siren wailing in distance)

03:39.290 --> 03:41.822
(Chvrches' "Gun" playing)

03:41.822 --> 03:43.994
HERE'S TO OUR LITTLE DUCKIE
FINALLY GETTING MARRIED.

03:43.994 --> 03:46.957
(women) TO DUCKIE AND MATTHEW!
(clink)

03:46.957 --> 03:48.699
"DUCKIE"?
DON'T ASK.

03:48.699 --> 03:51.862
MMM.
WE THOUGHT FOR SURE YOU WERE
GONNA BE A SPINSTER FOR LIFE.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.805
MAYBE TAKE IT A LITTLE EASY
ON THE MIMOSAS, KIMMIE.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.837
OH, LEAVE HER BE.
SHE'S CELEBRATING.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.440
YOU TWO COULD STAND TO ADD
A LITTLE CHAMPAGNE TO THAT O.J.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.741
WE'RE ON CALL.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.744
OHH. HE IS SUCH A DREAMBOAT.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.347
RESPONSIBLE, HANDSOME.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.350
DUCKIE, I HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.022
SPEAKING OF DREAMBOATS,

04:12.022 --> 04:14.885
WHO IS THAT
AND WHY IS HE WAVING AT US?

04:14.885 --> 04:16.727
(door opens)

04:16.727 --> 04:19.029
HEY, GUYS.
HEY, AVERY.

04:19.029 --> 04:22.262

O.M.GOSH!

04:23.564 --> 04:25.436

04:25.436 --> 04:28.299
LOOK AT THAT.
I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

04:28.299 --> 04:30.000
YEAH. IT WAS, UH,
NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.002
OH, WAIT. YOU'LL BE DONE IN TIME
FOR MANI-PEDIS, RIGHT?

04:32.002 --> 04:34.645
I WILL TRY. CAN YOU TAKE THEM
BACK TO MY APARTMENT?

04:34.645 --> 04:36.276
ROGER THAT.
OH, NO WAY!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.748
WE WANNA GO WITH YOU.
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
WE'RE THERE.

04:37.748 --> 04:39.279
WE CAN SEE THE ROOM
FOR THE SHOWER TOMORROW,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.381
PLAN DECORATIONS.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.413
WHOO! FIELD TRIP.

04:42.413 --> 04:45.285
COME ON, DUCKIE.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.017
BYE, BOYS.

04:47.017 --> 04:49.920
(lowered voice)
GOSH, THOSE EYES.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.622
YOU KNOW, I TOTALLY GET WHY
YOU'D NAME A PIG AFTER HIM.

04:51.622 --> 04:54.465
♪ I WILL BE A GUN ♪

04:54.465 --> 04:56.567
♪ AND IT'S YOU I'LL COME FOR ♪

04:56.567 --> 04:58.929
HEY. SOMEONE PAGED ME?

04:58.929 --> 05:01.832
THAT MAN OVER THERE
REQUESTED YOU.

05:01.832 --> 05:04.074
HEY, HON.

05:04.074 --> 05:05.035
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:05.035 --> 05:06.737
(breathing heavily)

05:06.737 --> 05:07.778
I THINK I'M GONNA PUKE.

05:07.778 --> 05:08.979
YOU HAVE TO GO.
ARE YOU HIGH?

05:08.979 --> 05:10.611
NO.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.983
I'M--I'M TRYING
TO GET CLEAN.

05:12.983 --> 05:15.346
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT HERE.

05:15.346 --> 05:17.317
YOU SAID...

05:17.317 --> 05:18.719
WHEN I WAS HERE,
YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.421
YEAH, I TRIED TO, JIMMY,

05:20.421 --> 05:22.793
BUT YOU REFUSED MY HELP,
AND THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

05:22.793 --> 05:24.995
NOW I CAN GET
SOME NAMES FOR YOU...

05:24.995 --> 05:25.956

ALL RIGHT, WELL,

05:44.375 --> 05:45.546
YEAH.

05:48.879 --> 05:50.381

05:50.381 --> 05:51.622
YEAH, I TRY TO HOLD OFF

05:51.622 --> 05:52.823
SO I DON'T DRINK IT ALL
BEFORE WORK.

05:52.823 --> 05:54.455
OH. YEAH. THAT'S--
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.926
(grunts) HEY!

05:55.926 --> 05:57.357
HEY! THIS IS MY CAB!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.759
TAKE A WALK, HIPPIE.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.130
WHAT? NOT COOL, MAN.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.892
AREN'T YOU PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO
LOVE BIKES OR SOMETHING?

06:01.892 --> 06:03.834
HEY.

06:03.834 --> 06:04.895
(man) HEY, OPEN THE DOOR.
PEOPLE ARE FREAKING ANIMALS.

06:04.895 --> 06:06.066
RIGHT?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.137
HEY, MY TIE.
(engine starts)

06:07.137 --> 06:08.138
GO!
OPEN THE DOOR.

06:08.138 --> 06:10.070

06:23.714 --> 06:24.655
I NEED ALL OF YOU TO STEP BACK,
PLEASE. STEP BACK.

06:24.655 --> 06:25.856
MAKE ROOM.
(man) I DON'T KNOW.

06:25.856 --> 06:28.088
(woman) HE'S NOT MOVING.
AH, HE'S NOT BREATHING.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.159
9-1-1 SAID
A RIG'S TEN MINUTES OUT,

06:29.159 --> 06:30.861
BUT WE GOTTA
GET AN AIRWAY NOW.

06:30.861 --> 06:32.062
I SWEAR I DIDN'T SEE IT HAPPEN.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, ALL RIGHT?

06:32.062 --> 06:33.494
STEP BACK. BACK, SIR.
OH, GOD. IS HE BREATHING?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.896
I NEED YOU TO BACK UP!
BACK UP!
OKAY! OKAY!

06:35.896 --> 06:37.097
I NEED YOU TO BACK UP, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.128
SERIOUSLY, STAND BACK.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.971
BACK UP. BACK UP.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

06:40.971 --> 06:42.072
BACK UP. BACK IT UP.

06:42.072 --> 06:43.674
(woman) HE'S NOT BREATHING.

06:43.674 --> 06:45.576
WHOA! JEEZ!

06:45.576 --> 06:46.807
(crowd) OHH!

06:46.807 --> 06:48.839
WHOA! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

06:48.839 --> 06:51.041
GOOD CHEST RISE.
I THINK HE'S BREATHING.
(man) I HOPE HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

06:51.041 --> 06:55.716
(siren wailing in distance,
indistinct conversations)

06:55.716 --> 06:56.947
(Owen) THE CAMERAS
ARE ONLY RECORDING

06:56.947 --> 06:58.889
THE DOCTORS
AND THE SURGICAL FIELD.

06:58.889 --> 07:01.822
YOUR SON'S IDENTITY WILL BE
COMPLETELY PROTECTED.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.694
GOOD MORNING.
BIG DAY.

07:03.694 --> 07:06.026
(voice breaks) WE'RE JUST
HEARING ABOUT THE CAMERAS.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.529
SORRY?
WE JUST TOLD THE GLAZIERS

07:08.529 --> 07:10.200
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO'D LIKE TO OBSERVE,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.703
SO WE'VE SET UP A LIVE STREAM.

07:12.703 --> 07:14.605
OKAY, BUT I THINK
WE WOULD FEEL BETTER

07:14.605 --> 07:17.538
IF WE KNEW THE FOCUS WAS ON
OUR BABY, NOT PUTTING ON A SHOW.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.710
(Owen) THE CAMERAS ARE THERE
SO THAT, IN SUCCESS,

07:19.710 --> 07:21.842
OTHER DOCTORS CAN LEARN
THIS TECHNIQUE

07:21.842 --> 07:23.944
TO HELP OTHER KIDS LIKE NATHAN.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.678
NO. NO, THAT DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME. HE'S A BABY.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.480
HE'S A BABY.
ASHLEY.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.021
ASHLEY, LOOK AT ME.

07:31.021 --> 07:33.453
I WILL BE PERFORMING
THE OPERATION,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.586
AND MY FOCUS WILL BE YOUR SON.

07:35.586 --> 07:38.859
THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT, OKAY?
THAT'S IT.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.036
(indistinct conversations)

07:46.036 --> 07:48.669
YOU SPRING THIS ON ME
THE DAY OF SURGERY?
WHAT?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.140
THIS CIRCUS?

07:50.140 --> 07:51.842
ROSS SAID THAT
THIS CAME FROM YOU.

07:51.842 --> 07:54.244
EVERYONE IN THE HOSPITAL'S BEEN
ASKING TO WATCH THE PROCEDURE.

07:54.244 --> 07:55.806
I GOT E-MAILS FROM U.C.L.A.
AND BAYLOR.

07:55.806 --> 07:57.077
THEY WANTED A STREAM.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.208
AND I FELT NONE OF THAT
SHOULD BE ON YOUR PLATE,

07:58.208 --> 07:59.680
SO I MADE
SOME EXECUTIVE DECISIONS.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.111
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU VETO
ANY OF THEM.

08:01.111 --> 08:02.553
YEAH, LIKE ALL OF 'EM.

08:02.553 --> 08:03.954
IF THAT'S WHAT DR. YANG WANTS,
CONSIDER IT DONE.

08:03.954 --> 08:05.856
ROSS, HANG ON.

08:05.856 --> 08:07.017
THIS IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL.

08:07.017 --> 08:08.589
WE NEED TO CREATE CONDITIONS

08:08.589 --> 08:10.891
WHERE MORE PEOPLE CAN LEARN
FROM WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.764
LIVE STREAMING?
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

08:13.764 --> 08:16.026
EVEN IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

08:16.026 --> 08:18.068
YOU'RE DOING IMPORTANT WORK,
AND PEOPLE SHOULD SEE THAT.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.670
(pager chimes)

08:19.670 --> 08:20.731
(sighs deeply)
I NEED TAKE THIS ONE.

08:20.731 --> 08:22.102
CRISTINA?

08:22.102 --> 08:24.074
(telephone rings)

08:24.074 --> 08:26.136
FINE.

08:30.741 --> 08:33.213
OKAY, NOW WE'RE GONNA
START SMALL TODAY.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.045
JUST WIGGLE YOUR FINGERS.

08:35.045 --> 08:36.887
(woman) GOT IT.
OKAY.

08:36.887 --> 08:38.689
LET ME DO IT.
OKAY.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.999
YEAH, OKAY.
HOW ABOUT JUST ONE FINGER?

08:48.999 --> 08:50.300
NOW JUST A FINGER?
MM-HMM.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.832
WHICH ONE?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.033
YOUR CHOICE.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.905
KEEP IT CLEAN, THOUGH.
(chuckles)

08:54.905 --> 08:56.306
AND JUST TRY TO RELAX.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.970
I'M PRETTY RELAXED, JOHN.

08:59.970 --> 09:03.043
NOT GONNA DISTRACT YOU.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.045
I'M JUST GONNA GO
GRAB A BITE.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.176
DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?

09:06.176 --> 09:08.118
I WANNA MOVE
THIS STUPID FINGER.

09:08.118 --> 09:12.022
YOU CAN DO IT.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.727
TRY AGAIN?

09:16.727 --> 09:19.059
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.863
(typing)

09:25.135 --> 09:26.597
DAMN IT!

09:26.597 --> 09:29.099
YOU PUT THE SENSORS
IN WEEKS AGO.

09:29.099 --> 09:31.902
I HAVEN'T MOVED
THE DAMN THING ONCE.

09:31.902 --> 09:33.143
YOU WILL.

09:33.143 --> 09:36.046
JUST FOCUS
ON WIGGLING THE FINGERS.

09:36.046 --> 09:37.307
OKAY? JUST BEND IT
FROM HERE--

09:37.307 --> 09:39.009
I CAN'T FOCUS ON ANYTHING
WITH YOU TALKING AT ME.

09:48.919 --> 09:51.792
OKAY, HANG A BANANA BAG
AND GIVE HIM 2 OF ATIVAN.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.163
I'VE TREATED HIM BEFORE.

09:53.163 --> 09:54.224
HE'S A HEROIN ADDICT.

09:54.224 --> 09:56.326
OKAY, LET'S, UH,
START A TOX SCREEN

09:56.326 --> 09:57.968
AND START HIM ON METHADONE.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.129
(weak voice) NO.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.200
NO METHADONE.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.033
THE METHADONE
WILL HELP YOU DETOX.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.905
I HAVEN'T USED IN MONTHS.

10:04.905 --> 10:08.308
I GOTTA GET TOTALLY CLEAN.
OFF THE METHADONE, TOO.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.640
I GOTTA DO IT.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.141
LET ME DO IT.

10:11.141 --> 10:12.783
(siren wailing in distance)

10:12.783 --> 10:16.016
OKAY, THEN. NO METHADONE.

10:16.016 --> 10:19.119
LET'S ADMIT HIM
AND WATCH HIM.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.892
CAN WE SEND HIM
TO A REHAB FACILITY?

10:21.892 --> 10:23.794
HE'S--HE'S ALEX'S DAD.

10:23.794 --> 10:26.897
THERE'S HISTORY.
LIKE, BAD HISTORY.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.729
(sighs)
I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.731
FOR YOU, HE IS A PATIENT
WHO HAD HEART SURGERY

10:30.731 --> 10:32.002
LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AGO.

10:32.002 --> 10:34.204
AND YOU ARE HIS DOCTOR,
SO ACT LIKE IT.

10:34.204 --> 10:35.906
GET HIM ADMITTED.

10:35.906 --> 10:38.939
OH, UH, DR. HUNT?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.170
HEY, I DID IT.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.873
UM, I DID TWO DAYS
WITH HER FOLLOWING ME AROUND

10:42.873 --> 10:44.174
EVERYWHERE I GO.

10:44.174 --> 10:47.047
I DON'T NEED HELP ANYMORE.
I'M DOING REALLY WELL.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.019
YOU'RE PULLING
YOUR FINGERS AGAIN.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.981
(clenched teeth)
OH, GOD. GO AWAY.

10:50.981 --> 10:54.254
UH, LOOK, I-I JUST WANNA
BE CLEARED FOR SURGERY.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.757
DR. ALMA, IS SHE CLEAR
FOR SURGERY?

10:56.757 --> 10:57.788
NO, SHE'S NOT.

10:57.788 --> 11:00.090
HMM. DR. BAILEY,
YOU'RE NOT CLEAR

11:00.090 --> 11:02.933
UNTIL SHE SAYS
YOU'RE CLEAR.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.238
OKAY, UM...

11:08.238 --> 11:10.140
WE NEED
TO FAST TRACK THIS

11:10.140 --> 11:12.172
BECAUSE, UH, I HAVE PATIENTS
TRYING TO SCHEDULE SURGERIES.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.874
SO...

11:13.874 --> 11:17.908
JUST--JUST TELL ME WHAT HOOP
I NEED TO JUMP THROUGH

11:17.908 --> 11:20.080
FOR YOU TO CLEAR ME.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.882
(telephone rings in distance)

11:21.882 --> 11:24.855
AND THIS IS THE E.R.,
WHERE I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME.

11:24.855 --> 11:27.117
I KIND OF RUN IT. (chuckles)

11:27.117 --> 11:29.419
AH, HEY. WHO'S THIS?

11:29.419 --> 11:30.460
THESE ARE MY SISTERS.

11:30.460 --> 11:31.762
(Libby, Kimmie, and Alice)
HI.

11:31.762 --> 11:33.724
HI, I'M ARIZONA ROBBINS.
IT'S--

11:33.724 --> 11:34.825
ARIZONA!

11:34.825 --> 11:35.866
(giggles)

11:35.866 --> 11:36.897
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.029
APRIL TOLD US EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

11:39.029 --> 11:40.731
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE IT
TO THE SHOWER?

11:40.731 --> 11:42.773
WE THROW THE BEST SHOWERS.

11:42.773 --> 11:44.174
I-I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

11:44.174 --> 11:46.977
I HAVE A CAT A HOME
WHO LOST A LEG.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.439
EVERY TIME I SEE HIM
HOPPING AROUND,

11:49.439 --> 11:52.082
I JUST THINK,
THAT IS REAL STRENGTH.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.313
STOP TALKING.
(elevator bell dings)

11:53.313 --> 11:55.846
WELL, IT WAS SUPER NICE
TO MEET YOU GUYS.

11:55.846 --> 11:58.188
AND I WILL SEE YOU
AT THE SHOWER.

11:58.188 --> 12:00.120
(siren wailing in distance)

12:00.120 --> 12:01.221
SHE IS SUCH A GOOD WALKER.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.924
OKAY, UM, I'M JUST
GONNA GET DRESSED.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.026
AND THEN WE'LL HEAD OUT.
OKAY?
(man) COMING THROUGH!

12:06.026 --> 12:07.497
32-YEAR-OLD MALE.
WE JUST LOST HIS AIRWAY.

12:07.497 --> 12:09.099
I'M GONNA CHANGE IT OVER
A WIRE.

12:09.099 --> 12:10.230
WE NEED A 5 MILLIMETER SHILEY

12:10.230 --> 12:11.762
AND A PERCUTANEOUS TRACH KIT
RIGHT AWAY.

12:11.762 --> 12:13.033
LET'S GET HIM SET UP
FOR TRANSFER.

12:13.033 --> 12:17.237
(April) BY MY COUNT,
ONE, TWO, THREE.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.839
(Jackson) ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
BETADINE THE NECK.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.940
HE COULDN'T BREATHE
SO I TRACHED HIM.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.812
YOU TRACHED HIM?
OH, YEAH, HE DID.

12:21.812 --> 12:23.774
TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE
BOY SCOUT KNIFE

12:23.774 --> 12:25.515
AND SLICED A WIDE
AND HORIZONTAL INCISION

12:25.515 --> 12:27.948
INTO HIS THROAT, WAY LOWER
THAN IT NEEDED TO BE--

12:27.948 --> 12:29.980
ALL THINGS I'M GONNA NEED
TO FIX IN SURGERY.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.183
READY?

12:33.183 --> 12:34.424
(squirts)
WHOA!

12:34.424 --> 12:35.786
EW.
MOTHER OF...

12:35.786 --> 12:37.127
SICK.
YOU GUYS CANNOT BE IN HERE.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.258
DAMN IT. ALL RIGHT,
LET THE O.R. KNOW THAT WE GOTTA

12:38.258 --> 12:40.791
COME UP THERE
AND FIX YOUR MESS.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.062
HEY, I HAD TO DO IT LIKE THAT.
AND WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK,

12:42.062 --> 12:43.263
YOU'RE GONNA SEE THAT.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.364
IT DOESN'T MATTER RIGHT NOW.
WHAT MATTERS IS

12:44.364 --> 12:45.535
WE HAVE TO GET HIM READY
FOR TRANSFER.

12:45.535 --> 12:46.867
SO CAN YOU JUST
TAKE MY SISTERS AND GO NOW?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.545
ALEX, I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING

12:55.545 --> 12:57.277
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
WANNA HEAR.
WELL, THEN DON'T TELL ME.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.180
YOUR DAD'S HERE.
JIMMY'S HERE.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.781
WHAT? WHY?

13:01.781 --> 13:03.153
HE'S GOING THROUGH
WITHDRAWAL.

13:03.153 --> 13:05.485
KICK HIM OUT.
I CAN'T.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.157
I CAN.

13:07.157 --> 13:08.458
ALEX...

13:08.458 --> 13:11.061
GET UP.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.562
(door closes)

13:12.562 --> 13:14.965
(breathing unevenly)
HEY, SON.

13:14.965 --> 13:16.396
HOW YOU DOIN'?

13:21.071 --> 13:22.102
YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE.
(gate clinks)

13:22.102 --> 13:23.373
WE'VE HELPED YOU ONCE.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.335
WE'RE NOT HELPING YOU
WITH THIS.
ALEX--

13:25.335 --> 13:26.476
SON, LISTEN--

13:26.476 --> 13:27.577
OH, STOP CALLING ME THAT.

13:27.577 --> 13:28.808
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.841
I DIDN'T REMEMBER--
I DON'T CARE.

13:30.841 --> 13:33.383
I DIDN'T REMEMBER TILL
I SAW YOU PISSED OFF,

13:33.383 --> 13:34.985
TILL I SAW YOU
STANDING OVER ME.

13:34.985 --> 13:37.247
LIKE WHEN YOU WERE 15,
YOU SAID YOU WISHED I WAS DEAD.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.051
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET RIGHT
SINCE THE BAR.

13:41.051 --> 13:42.592
I'M STILL TRYING.
NOT HERE.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.024
NO, ALEX, STOP.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.025
I'M NOT GONNA HELP A GUY
WHO MADE MY LIFE HELL.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.296
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:46.296 --> 13:48.258
BUT I AM BECAUSE HE NEEDS HELP
AND I'M A DOCTOR.

13:49.299 --> 13:50.560
YOU CAN GO.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.162
I GOT THIS.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

13:58.308 --> 14:00.871
SO IT'S NOT THE SENSORS.
IS IT THE CODING?

14:00.871 --> 14:02.612
CODING'S BEEN TESTED
AND RETESTED.

14:02.612 --> 14:03.843
(sighs) SO IT'S BECCA.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.215
IT'S BECCA.

14:05.215 --> 14:08.478
(whispering) LOOK, SHE IS NOT
THE MOST POSITIVE PERSON,

14:08.478 --> 14:09.920
I MEAN, EVERY DAY
IT'S A FIGHT.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.181
BUT SHE'S TRYING.

14:11.181 --> 14:14.124
SHE'S NO RAY OF SUNSHINE,
BUT SHE'S TRYING.

14:14.124 --> 14:16.486
UH, MAYBE IT'S ME.

14:16.486 --> 14:18.158
MAYBE IT'S NOT BECCA.
MAYBE I'M JUST NOT SAYING

14:18.158 --> 14:19.890
THE RIGHT THING
TO GET HER TO DO IT.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.563
(sighs deeply)

14:23.563 --> 14:24.995
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU

14:24.995 --> 14:29.069
TO LEARN THAT I AM
QUITE GOOD AT SUTURES.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.101
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME
IN THE LEAST.

14:31.101 --> 14:33.643
WHAT WOULD SURPRISE ME
IS IF YOU WERE ABLE TO DO

14:33.643 --> 14:37.547
FIVE OF THEM WITHOUT
ENGAGING IN O.C.D. BEHAVIORS.

14:37.547 --> 14:40.880
(sighs) AND IF I CAN,
YOU'LL SIGN OFF

14:40.880 --> 14:42.182
SO I CAN GO BACK TO WORK?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.014
THAT'S THE DEAL.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.585
FIVE SUTURES.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.357
THAT'S ALL?

14:47.357 --> 14:49.459
THAT'S ALL.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.193
GAME ON.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.096
UH, JUST A SEC.

14:57.527 --> 15:02.572
(instruments clattering)

15:09.279 --> 15:12.582
NOW... ONLY USE THE TOOLS
TO YOUR IMMEDIATE RIGHT.

15:12.582 --> 15:16.086
IF YOU TOUCH ANY OF THE TRAYS,
WE START OVER.

15:16.086 --> 15:19.249
IF YOU COUNT YOUR FINGERS,
IF YOU DOUBLE-CHECK A STITCH,

15:19.249 --> 15:22.092
IF YOU REARRANGE ANY OF
THE INSTRUMENTS ON THE TRAYS,

15:22.092 --> 15:23.153
WE START OVER.

15:23.153 --> 15:26.526
FIVE SUTURES.
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

15:33.563 --> 15:35.535
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
YELLED AT MATTHEW

15:35.535 --> 15:37.067
IN FRONT OF MY SISTERS.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.069
NOW THEY'RE GONNA THINK
I'M ENGAGED TO A NITWIT.

15:39.069 --> 15:41.411
ALL RIGHT, DUCKIE--
DON'T CALL ME DUCKIE!

15:41.411 --> 15:43.513
(suction gurgling)

15:43.513 --> 15:45.215
OKAY.

15:45.215 --> 15:47.077
IT MEANS "UGLY DUCKLING"

15:47.077 --> 15:49.579
BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH BRACES
AND PIMPLES,

15:49.579 --> 15:51.181
AND THEY STILL
SEE ME THAT WAY.

15:51.181 --> 15:54.284
IT'S LIKE IDIOT INCAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING RIGHT.

15:54.284 --> 15:56.156
I'M A FREAKING TRAUMA
SURGEON!

15:58.528 --> 16:00.060
HE DID A GREAT JOB.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.662
ACTUALLY, I WOULD'VE DONE
EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.663
MATTHEW WAS RIGHT?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.535
YEP.

16:05.535 --> 16:06.596
YOU SHOULD GO
SPREAD THE WORD.

16:06.596 --> 16:09.139
YOU ARE NOT ENGAGED
TO A NITWIT.

16:09.139 --> 16:10.700
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE

16:10.700 --> 16:13.203
A PRETTY EASY FIX.
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

16:13.203 --> 16:14.674
GO AHEAD AND GO?
I GOT IT.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.406
REALLY? I WAS KINDA HOPIN'

16:16.406 --> 16:19.149
THAT I COULD HIDE OUT
HERE ALL DAY. (chuckles)

16:19.149 --> 16:20.610
THEY CAME ALL THIS WAY
TO SEE YOU.

16:20.610 --> 16:21.551
YOU SHOULD GO.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.516
SMILE.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.019
EDWARDS, CAN WE STOP FIDDLING
WITH THE CAMERA?

16:29.019 --> 16:30.660
AND LET'S GET STARTED.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.664
(instruments clatter)

16:34.664 --> 16:36.766
GETTING PROXIMAL VASCULAR
CONTROL.

16:36.766 --> 16:40.570
(loudly) SHE SAID SHE'S GETTING
PROXIMAL VASCULAR CONTROL.

16:40.570 --> 16:41.571
YOU'RE CHANGING
THE FACE OF MEDICINE,

16:41.571 --> 16:43.002
YOU NEED TO BE LOUDER.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.304
DO YOU KNOW
WHO DOESN'T TALK ABOUT

16:44.304 --> 16:45.775
CHANGING
THE FACE OF MEDICINE?

16:45.775 --> 16:48.007
PEOPLE WHO CHANGE
THE FACE OF MEDICINE.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.679
THEY JUST DO THEIR JOB.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.111
(suction gurgling)

16:51.111 --> 16:55.715
OKAY, PREPARING TO PLACE
THE PORTAL VEIN.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.587
(woman) DOCTOR...
(speaks indistinctly)

16:57.587 --> 17:00.690
DR. YANG, SURGEONS
AT BAYLOR HAVE JOINED US.

17:02.052 --> 17:03.293
OKAY, AT THIS POINT,

17:03.293 --> 17:05.325
I HAVE DISSECTED
THE SCAR TISSUE

17:05.325 --> 17:07.227
AND PUT THE PATIENT
ON BYPASS.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.498
TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

17:08.498 --> 17:10.600
WE JUST RECEIVED WORD
THAT THE CONDUIT

17:10.600 --> 17:12.662
HAS GONE THROUGH ITS
FINAL ROUND OF TESTS,

17:12.662 --> 17:14.434
AND IS ON ITS WAY
TO THE O.R.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.635
WHILE WE WAIT,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.707
DR. KAREV CAN GIVE A BRIEF
PATIENT HISTORY.

17:17.707 --> 17:19.769
(Alex) 9-MONTH-OLD
BORN WITH HYPOPLASTIC

17:19.769 --> 17:22.472
LEFT HEART SYNDROME.
HE'S REJECTED

17:22.472 --> 17:24.714
THE SYNTHETIC CONDUIT
THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY PLACED.

17:24.714 --> 17:26.646
THIS CONDUIT WAS GRANTED
BY F.D.A.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.717
WITH COMPASSIONATE USE.

17:31.081 --> 17:32.582
THIS IS DR. ROSS.

17:32.582 --> 17:35.555
AND THIS IS THE CONDUIT
WE PRINTED

17:35.555 --> 17:38.628
ON THE 3D PRINTER.

17:38.628 --> 17:42.562
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, LET'S COMMENCE
WITH THE IMPLANTATION PROCESS.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.834
(Meredith)
DECLAMPING THE PORTAL VEIN.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.537
OH! WE HAVE BLOOD FLOW!

17:47.537 --> 17:48.698
OKAY, LET'S RECHECK VITALS.

17:48.698 --> 17:52.102
OH, UH, BLOOD PRESSURE'S
115 OVER 75.

17:52.102 --> 17:53.703
BLOOD PRESSURE'S FALLING.
YOU KNOW, THE CONDUIT IS

17:53.703 --> 17:55.775
A LITTLE SMALLER
THAN ANTICIPATED.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.649
I'M GONNA DO A TRIANGULAR CUT
WITH A PATCH.

17:59.649 --> 18:02.512
(Cristina) Call the lab and try
to... (speaks indistinctly)

18:02.512 --> 18:04.314
global testing.
(Arizona whispers) EXCUSE ME.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.656
DID SHE MOVE HER HAND?
(Cristina continues
speaking indistinctly)

18:06.656 --> 18:07.787
NO.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.689
OH, THAT SUCKS.
(clears throat) YES.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.222
WELL, IT'S JUST--IT JUST
TAKES TIME, RIGHT?

18:12.222 --> 18:14.164
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

18:14.164 --> 18:16.696
WELL, CHEER UP.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.368
WHY? (chuckles)

18:18.368 --> 18:21.301
MY RESEARCH JUST STALLED.
WHY WOULD I CHEER UP?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.173
I DON'T KNOW.

18:23.173 --> 18:26.606
I DON'T KNOW, THAT'S JUST
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SAY--
I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.508
I'M JUST...
LET'S NOT FIGHT.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.680
CALLIE, I--
I SHOULD GET BACK.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.383
All of our preliminary research,
however... (speaks indistinctly)

18:33.383 --> 18:36.446
WOW. DID YOU SEE THAT?

18:36.446 --> 18:38.288
YEAH, THAT WAS INTENSE.
MM-HMM.

18:38.288 --> 18:39.549
DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE GONNA BREAK UP?

18:43.853 --> 18:45.755
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:45.755 --> 18:47.397
C.V.P. IS LOW, HE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH VOLUME.

18:47.397 --> 18:48.858
OKAY, UH, GIVE ANOTHER,
UH, BOLUS OF L.R.

18:48.858 --> 18:50.730
YOU'RE GONNA FLUID
OVERLOAD HIM.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.702
WHAT'S THAT PIECE STICKING UP
ON THE CONDUIT?

18:52.702 --> 18:54.234
IS THERE A GAP
IN THE ANASTOMOSIS?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.366
DR. YANG?

18:56.366 --> 18:57.467
SAY SOMETHING.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.239
FOR POSTERITY.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.171
UH, THIS IS
DR. MEREDITH GREY.

19:01.171 --> 19:04.544
TODAY, WE IMPLANTED
A 3D PRINTED PORTAL VEIN

19:04.544 --> 19:06.616
WITH SEEDED CELLS
INTO A SHEEP.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.578
CURRENTLY, HER VITALS
ARE STABLE,

19:08.578 --> 19:12.482
AND DR. EDWARDS WILL CONTINUE
TO MONITOR HER VIA ULTRASOUND.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.884
OUR HOPE
IS THAT THE PORTAL VEIN

19:14.884 --> 19:18.728
WILL CONTINUE TO HEAL,
WITHOUT STENOSIS.

19:18.728 --> 19:19.759
(monitor beeping erratically)
(Shane) HE'S IN V-FIB.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.931
DAMN IT. STARTING C.P.R.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.393
(Alex) INTERNAL PADDLES.
(Cristina) OKAY.

19:23.393 --> 19:24.434
CHARGE TO 10.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.566
(lowered voice)
TURN THE CAMERA OFF.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.438
CLEAR.
(paddles thunk)

19:28.438 --> 19:30.370
ROSS, GET THE CAMERA OFF.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.541
STOP FILMING.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.251
WE'VE SAT OUTSIDE
ALL NIGHT LONG

19:41.251 --> 19:43.213
WAITING TO HOLD HIM,
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING US

19:43.213 --> 19:44.454
THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT LONGER?

19:44.454 --> 19:46.416
NATHAN'S NUMBERS STILL
AREN'T STABLE ENOUGH FOR--

19:46.416 --> 19:47.657
WE SHOULD'VE NEVER LET YOU
TALK US INTO THIS.

19:47.657 --> 19:49.659
WE SHOULD'VE GONE WITH
THE SYNTHETIC GRAFT.

19:49.659 --> 19:51.291
WE SHOULD'VE
LISTENED TO YOU.
IT'S STILL EARLY.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.463
THE CONDUIT COULD STILL
BE A SUCCESS.

19:53.463 --> 19:54.694
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.367
LOOK ME IN THE EYE
AND TELL ME YOU BELIEVE THAT.

19:59.829 --> 20:02.201
LET'S FOCUS
ON WHAT WE KNOW.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.773
RIGHT NOW,
HE'S ON THE OSCILLATOR

20:03.773 --> 20:05.505
TO FORCE OXYGEN
INTO HIS LUNGS,

20:05.505 --> 20:06.736
AND IF HE CAN
MAINTAIN HIS SATS,

20:06.736 --> 20:07.907
WE HOPE TO BE ABLE
TO GET HIM ON

20:07.907 --> 20:09.679
A NORMAL VENTILATOR.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.481
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

20:11.481 --> 20:12.582
OKAY?

20:16.316 --> 20:17.387
(telephone rings)

20:17.387 --> 20:19.419
(woman) NURSES' STATION.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.850
THANKS FOR THE STRONG SHOW
OF SUPPORT.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.422
SORRY, I'VE GOT...

20:22.422 --> 20:23.923
(inhales deeply)
I GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.926
ALEX...
YEAH, IT'S JUST BEEN
A CRAP COUPLE OF DAYS.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.598
ALEX...

20:28.598 --> 20:29.759
DO YOU REALLY THINK

20:29.759 --> 20:31.831
THE CONDUIT'S GONNA
BE A SUCCESS?

20:31.831 --> 20:35.605
I DON'T KNOW.
I HOPE SO.

20:38.468 --> 20:42.312
(monitor beeping steadily)
(groaning)

20:42.312 --> 20:44.414
DO YOU WANT
ANOTHER BLANKET?

20:44.414 --> 20:46.276
WHERE'S ALEX?

20:46.276 --> 20:48.648
ALEX, COME HERE!

20:48.648 --> 20:50.780
SHH. I'M HERE.

20:50.780 --> 20:53.252
WHO BROKE THIS?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.454
WHERE'S HE AT?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.686
JIMMY, ALEX ISN'T
COMING BACK.

20:56.686 --> 20:58.858
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.490
(breathing heavily)

21:00.490 --> 21:04.494
HELEN, YOU LET THE DAMN KID
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.466
I TOLD HIM NOT TO PLAY
WITH MY STUFF.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.598
NOW LOOK AT THIS!

21:08.598 --> 21:11.871
WHERE--ALEX! LOOK AT THIS!
JIMMY. JIMMY.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.303
IT'S DR. WILSON,

21:13.303 --> 21:16.306
YOU'RE DETOXING,
WHICH CAUSES HALLUCINATIONS.

21:16.306 --> 21:21.581
AH, OH, GOD. DON'T START
THAT CRAP WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.353
HELEN...

21:23.353 --> 21:24.584
(beeping)
I SWEAR TO GOD.

21:24.584 --> 21:28.988
I... (breathing heavily)

21:28.988 --> 21:30.860
SHH.
ALEX.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.662
(whispers) OKAY. OKAY.

21:34.424 --> 21:37.296
OKAY.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.500
OKAY, SHH.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.932
(bell dings)

21:42.932 --> 21:45.705
(indistinct conversations)

21:45.705 --> 21:48.338
DR. ROSS,
HOW'S IT GOING?

21:48.338 --> 21:49.479
DON'T BE SMUG.

21:49.479 --> 21:51.441
WHAT?

21:51.441 --> 21:53.413
YOU WON, WE LOST.
I GET IT.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.416
DR. ROSS, YOU DO NOT GET
TO TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.417
(bell dings)

21:57.417 --> 21:59.989
CONGRATULATIONS.

21:59.989 --> 22:02.652
DR. ROSS, GET BACK HERE!

22:02.652 --> 22:06.396
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

22:06.396 --> 22:07.697
(woman) NURSES' STATION.
PLEASE HOLD.

22:07.697 --> 22:09.328
WHERE'S APRIL?

22:09.328 --> 22:12.031
OH! UM, A TRAUMA CAME IN.
SHE GOT PULLED INTO SURGERY.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.634
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG SHE'LL BE.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.406
SO, WHAT?
WE JUST CANCEL THE SHOWER?

22:16.406 --> 22:17.967
WE ALREADY PAID FOR
THE FLOWERS, THE FOOD,

22:17.967 --> 22:20.470
THE CHAMPAGNE.
WHEN SHE CAME IN
THIS MORNING TO WORK,

22:20.470 --> 22:21.811
SHE PROMISED
SHE'D BE DONE ON TIME.

22:21.811 --> 22:23.573
YEAH, WE SAY A LOT
OF THINGS.

22:23.573 --> 22:26.376
LOOK, WE'RE JUST NOT IN CHARGE
OF OUR SCHEDULE.

22:26.376 --> 22:27.617
THIS IS JUST HOW IT WORKS.

22:27.617 --> 22:28.978
WHY DO YOU LIVE THIS WAY?

22:28.978 --> 22:30.620
BECAUSE WE SAVE
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.651
(elevator bell dings)

22:31.651 --> 22:33.483
SHE'LL POP IN
AT SOME POINT.

22:33.483 --> 22:35.385
NO, IT'S HER SHOWER.
SHE CAN'T JUST POP.

22:35.385 --> 22:38.488
YOU MAY HAVE TO SETTLE
FOR A POP.

22:38.488 --> 22:40.460
(telephone rings)

22:40.460 --> 22:46.436
(siren wailing in distance)

22:46.436 --> 22:49.439
(breathing heavily)
DONE.

22:49.439 --> 22:52.442
SEE? TWO DOWN, THREE TO GO.

22:52.442 --> 22:54.043
I THOUGHT THAT
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP

22:54.043 --> 22:56.476
WAS GONNA MAKE IT EASIER.

22:56.476 --> 22:59.479
(pills rattling)

23:01.411 --> 23:04.454
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL
MAKE IT EASIER.

23:04.454 --> 23:07.717
MIRANDA, I HATE TO SEE
YOU SUFFER LIKE THIS.

23:07.717 --> 23:09.519
TAKE THE MEDICATION.

23:09.519 --> 23:10.389
TWO DOWN,

23:10.389 --> 23:11.491
THREE TO GO.

23:11.491 --> 23:15.024
OKAY, OKAY, UM,

23:15.024 --> 23:16.496
WHY DON'T WE TAKE
A FIVE MINUTE BREAK?

23:16.496 --> 23:20.770
(sighs)
I'M GONNA GO VISIT
THE LADIES' ROOM.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.071
AND, UM...

23:26.506 --> 23:27.677
JUST FOR REFERENCE.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.078
(camera shutter clicking)
OH, COME--

23:29.078 --> 23:32.682
I'LL BE BACK.

23:42.852 --> 23:44.994
(crying)

23:44.994 --> 23:47.897
(mouths words)

24:01.771 --> 24:02.872
(door opens, instrument clanks)

24:05.044 --> 24:06.445
SIR, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

24:06.445 --> 24:07.977
WELL, IF I WAS GONNA
COME BACK TO WORK,

24:07.977 --> 24:10.019
I NEED TO PRACTICE
MY SKILLS.

24:10.019 --> 24:13.523
BUT YOU ARE JEOPARDIZING
YOUR RECOVERY.

24:13.523 --> 24:15.555
YOU SHOULD BE HOME, NOT--

24:15.555 --> 24:17.787
SITTING ON THE COUCH,
FLIPPING THROUGH THE CHANNELS

24:17.787 --> 24:20.960
ISN'T GONNA GET ME BACK
TO WORK IN AN O.R. ANY FASTER.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.933
I MEAN, I'M SITTING THERE
WATCHING HOUSEWIVES FLIP TABLES

24:23.933 --> 24:26.065
AND CELEBS FLIP HOUSES.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.537
AND PRETTY SOON,
IT'S JUST LIKE

24:27.537 --> 24:30.670
I COULD FEEL MY BRAIN CELLS
WITHER AND DIE.

24:33.002 --> 24:35.645
BAILEY,
THESE TRAYS ARE A MESS.

24:35.645 --> 24:39.178
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU EXPECT
TO FIND ANYTHING ON 'EM.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.811
(instruments clinking)

24:41.811 --> 24:43.152
OKAY, NOW VISUALIZE
THE LIGAMENTS

24:43.152 --> 24:47.116
IN YOUR RIGHT INDEX FINGER
CONTRACTING.

24:53.523 --> 24:56.225
(exhales)

24:56.225 --> 24:58.197
(under breath) STUPID,
STUPID, STUPID.
(door opens)

24:58.197 --> 25:01.100
HEY, BABE. THEY GOT THOSE
CHIPS YOU LIKE.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.533
(Becca)
JOHN, LEAVE US ALONE.

25:03.533 --> 25:04.804
I'M SORRY.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.205
JUST WAIT OUTSIDE,

25:06.205 --> 25:07.937
AND I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I'M DONE.

25:07.937 --> 25:09.839
JUST GO.

25:13.512 --> 25:17.146
(door opens and closes)

25:17.146 --> 25:20.620
(whispers) MY GOD.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.821
(normal voice)
DID YOU SEE THAT?

25:21.821 --> 25:23.723
I JUST KEEP SNAPPING
AT HIM.

25:23.723 --> 25:27.126
AND PRETTY SOON, WE CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.298
IT'S AWFUL.

25:29.298 --> 25:30.560
(whispering) I'M AWFUL.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.201
MNH-MNH.

25:32.201 --> 25:35.665
(whispering) BECAUSE...

25:35.665 --> 25:38.738
HE DOES EVERYTHING
FOR ME.

25:38.738 --> 25:44.073
AND I STARTED THIS BECAUSE
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

25:44.073 --> 25:46.015
FOR HIM FOR ONCE.

25:46.015 --> 25:51.851
AND IT SEEMED LIKE
SOMETHING I COULD DO.

25:51.851 --> 25:57.026
I JUST WANTED TO DO...
(sniffles) ONE DAMN THING.

25:57.026 --> 26:00.089
(crying) AND I CAN'T.

26:00.089 --> 26:01.761
I'M DONE.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.134
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

26:05.134 --> 26:08.938
OKAY. LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

26:08.938 --> 26:10.339
NO, YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME.

26:10.339 --> 26:12.571
I DON'T WANNA DO THIS
ANYMORE.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.643
I CAN'T.

26:13.643 --> 26:15.004
I HATE THIS.

26:15.004 --> 26:19.208
TAKE THIS CRAP
OUT OF MY HEAD.

26:19.208 --> 26:22.111
(sniffles)
DO YOU WANNA SCHEDULE
SURGERY TO HAVE THEM TAKEN OUT?

26:22.111 --> 26:24.283
DR. TORRES,
WE ARE NOT THERE YET.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.314
WELL, IF SHE DOESN'T
WANNA KEEP--

26:25.314 --> 26:26.786
DR. TORRES,
MAY I TALK WITH YOU?

26:26.786 --> 26:28.217
YEAH.

26:28.217 --> 26:29.759
EXCUSE US.

26:31.661 --> 26:33.222
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:33.222 --> 26:34.293
NO, NO, NO,

26:34.293 --> 26:36.265
NO, NO, NO! NO.

26:36.265 --> 26:39.829
SHE DISTENDED. SHE DROPPED
PRESSURE AND FLATLINED.

26:39.829 --> 26:42.201
(erratic beeping continues)

26:42.201 --> 26:46.776
SHE'S BEEN DOWN
FOR 20 MINUTES, DR. EDWARDS.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.610
(flatlining)
IT'S OVER.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.382
(panting)

26:57.286 --> 26:58.888
(voice breaks)
SO SORRY, LITTLE GIRL.

26:58.888 --> 27:01.390
WE TRIED.

27:01.390 --> 27:04.353
EDWARDS, DO YOU KNOW

27:04.353 --> 27:07.026
HOW MANY DOGS
THE RUSSIANS SENT INTO SPACE

27:07.026 --> 27:08.698
BEFORE A MAN WALKED
ON THE MOON?

27:08.698 --> 27:10.129
(voice breaks)
THOSE POOR PUPPIES.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.400
(sniffles)

27:11.400 --> 27:13.933
EDWARDS, WE ARE
GOING TO DO A NECROPSY,

27:13.933 --> 27:16.906
AND WE ARE GOING
TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.

27:16.906 --> 27:19.308
AND THEN WE'LL TRY AGAIN,
AND WE'LL FAIL AGAIN,

27:19.308 --> 27:21.871
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE.

27:21.871 --> 27:24.013
PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE
A DEAD SHEEP.

27:24.013 --> 27:26.746
NO, PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE
A BUNCH OF FAILURES.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.118
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
FEELINGS ABOUT THAT

27:29.118 --> 27:32.021
BECAUSE IT'S SAD,
BUT YOU CAN'T FALL APART.

27:32.021 --> 27:33.652
AND THEN ONE DAY,
WE WILL SUCCEED,

27:33.652 --> 27:35.054
AND WE WILL
SAVE A PERSON'S LIFE.

27:35.054 --> 27:38.958
AND WE WILL
WALK ON THE MOON.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.359
FIGURATIVELY, ANYWAY.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.231
(chuckles and sniffles)

27:42.231 --> 27:44.393
ARE YOU WITH ME?

27:44.393 --> 27:47.937
(whispers) YEAH.

27:47.937 --> 27:49.138
SHE HATES BEING HERE.

27:49.138 --> 27:51.340
SHE SHOWS UP EVERY DAY.
SHE IS TRYING.
(scoffs)

27:51.340 --> 27:53.743
NO, I CAN'T FIGHT ANYMORE.
EVERY DAY---

27:53.743 --> 27:56.275
EVERY DAY IS A FIGHT.
MY WHOLE WORLD IS A FIGHT.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.777
AT HOME,
I FIGHT WITH ARIZONA,

27:57.777 --> 27:59.078
AND THEN I COME HERE
AND FIGHT WITH BECCA,

27:59.078 --> 28:00.409
AND NOW I'M FIGHTING
WITH YOU.

28:00.409 --> 28:02.011
WELL, WE JUST HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT YET...
(sighs)

28:02.011 --> 28:03.052
HOW TO GET HER TO DO IT.
SO WE'RE FRUSTRATED,

28:03.052 --> 28:04.153
AND SHE'S FRUSTRATED.

28:04.153 --> 28:05.955
MM.

28:05.955 --> 28:07.016
IS IT WRONG THAT I WISH

28:07.016 --> 28:09.218
THAT WATER
WERE A BOTTLE OF GIN?

28:12.261 --> 28:14.924
(sighs)

28:14.924 --> 28:18.868
IS THAT GONNA
BE FOR ME OR...

28:18.868 --> 28:19.999
WE NEED TO TALK TO BECCA.

28:22.271 --> 28:24.003
(door opens)

28:24.003 --> 28:27.076
IT IS SO GREAT THAT YOU TWO
ARE TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT.

28:27.076 --> 28:29.078
IT IS SO MUCH BETTER
FOR THE KIDS.

28:29.078 --> 28:34.413
DUCKIE DOESN'T KNOW THIS,
BUT MY HUSBAND HAD AN AFFAIR.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.045
OH, THAT'S...

28:36.045 --> 28:40.249
WE HAVE, UH, THREE BOYS,
SO WE STAYED TOGETHER.

28:40.249 --> 28:41.991
WOW, SO, DID YOU GO
TO THERAPY?

28:41.991 --> 28:43.152
BECAUSE WE CAN'T EVEN
AGREE ON THAT.

28:43.152 --> 28:44.353
OH, NO. MNH-MNH.

28:44.353 --> 28:46.255
WE DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED
TO TALK IT TO DEATH.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.998
WE JUST FOCUSED
ON MOVING FORWARD,

28:48.998 --> 28:50.860
PUTTING IT IN THE PAST.
OH.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.731
HOPING THINGS
WOULD GET BETTER ONE DAY.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.963
SO, WELL, DID THAT WORK?

28:57.036 --> 28:58.107
(bottle thuds)

28:58.107 --> 29:01.941
WELL... WE ARE STILL
GETTING THROUGH IT.

29:12.181 --> 29:16.856
(muttering)

29:16.856 --> 29:20.029
AND WE'RE BACK TO TWO.

29:20.029 --> 29:20.990
(sighs)
LET'S TRY FOR A THIRD.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.092
NO, NO,
THIS IS THE SEVENTH.

29:23.092 --> 29:25.094
TWO STITCHES AGO,
YOU TUGGED ON YOUR FINGERS.

29:25.094 --> 29:26.335
TWO BEFORE THAT,

29:26.335 --> 29:27.496
YOU STRAIGHTENED
AN INSTRUMENT ON THE TRAY.

29:27.496 --> 29:29.338
LOOK, I CAN'T--I CAN'T
KEEP DOING THIS.

29:29.338 --> 29:30.439
I CAN'T--
I KNOW.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.441
THEN YOU REALLY
NEED TO CONSIDER

29:32.441 --> 29:33.943
TAKING THE MEDICATION.

29:33.943 --> 29:36.305
OKAY, NO, I'M NOT TAKING
THE DAMN PILLS!

29:39.508 --> 29:42.281
BAILEY, I WAS GONNA HEAD UP
TO KEPNER'S SHOWER

29:42.281 --> 29:44.413
TO STEAL SOME FOOD.
COME WITH ME.

29:44.413 --> 29:48.117
YOU JUST NEED A BREAK.
N-N--I NEED...

29:48.117 --> 29:50.019
(inhales deeply)

29:50.019 --> 29:53.192
TO GET BACK INTO SURGERY.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.195
(Macklemore & Ryan Lewis'
"Make the Money" playing)

29:59.168 --> 30:01.971
I HEARD NATHAN'S NOT
DOING SO WELL.

30:01.971 --> 30:04.173
I'M SORRY.

30:04.173 --> 30:05.204
YEAH, I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

30:05.204 --> 30:07.006
IF THERE'S A PLAN "B"
WE CAN TRY.

30:07.006 --> 30:09.178
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE'S GONNA...

30:09.178 --> 30:10.809
(inhales deeply)

30:10.809 --> 30:13.943
I HEARD YOUR SHEEP
DID GREAT. CONGRATS.

30:13.943 --> 30:15.915
THANKS. ACTUALLY,
THE SHEEP DIED.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.189
OH, SORRY.
(sighs deeply)

30:20.189 --> 30:21.520
DID YOU NEED THE PRINTER?

30:21.520 --> 30:22.992
YEAH, BUT IF YOU
NEED IT MORE...

30:22.992 --> 30:25.054
NO, I'LL FINISH THIS UP,
AND THEN IT'S ALL YOURS.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.525
SO CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION,

30:26.525 --> 30:28.157
UM, ABOUT ROSS?

30:28.157 --> 30:30.329
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT HIM?

30:30.329 --> 30:31.861
HE SEEMS DIFFERENT.

30:31.861 --> 30:33.032
DO YOU NOTICE THAT?

30:33.032 --> 30:35.434
(beep)
WELL, NO, NOT REALLY.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.037
WELL, HE'S NOT THE SAME GUY
HE WAS WHEN HE STARTED HERE.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.909
HE'S NOT THE GUY
WHO DELIVERED MY BABY.

30:39.909 --> 30:42.511
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE NOT THE SAME
AS WHEN WE WERE INTERNS EITHER.

30:42.511 --> 30:44.113
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:44.113 --> 30:47.176
BUT HE IS AGGRESSIVE
AND MEAN.
(beeping)

30:47.176 --> 30:48.317
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,

30:48.317 --> 30:50.079
HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME
ON YOUR SERVICE.

30:50.079 --> 30:51.450
DO YOU THINK HE'S TRYING
TO BE LIKE YOU?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.882
OR... DO YOU NOTICE THAT?

30:52.882 --> 30:53.983
I'M SORRY.

30:53.983 --> 30:56.255
ARE YOU SAYING
I TAUGHT HIM TO BE MEAN?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.556
THAT'S WHAT HE'S LEARNED
FROM ME?

30:57.556 --> 30:59.088
NO.

30:59.088 --> 31:00.859
BECAUSE A LITTLE EDGE
IS NOT THE WORST THING

31:00.859 --> 31:02.031
FOR A SURGEON.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

31:02.031 --> 31:02.932
AND I AM NOT MEAN.

31:02.932 --> 31:04.063
I AM EFFECTIVE.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.364
ARE YOU IMPLYING
THAT I'M NOT?

31:05.364 --> 31:08.097
WELL, NO, YOU JUST SAID
I RUINED A RESIDENT.

31:08.097 --> 31:09.168
NO, THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.971
I SAID SOMETHING IS OFF
ABOUT ROSS.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.903
WELL, MAYBE HE GOT TIRED
OF PEOPLE THINKING

31:13.903 --> 31:15.104
HE WAS SOFT AROUND
THE EDGES.

31:15.104 --> 31:17.006
MAYBE HIS FOCUS
IS BEING A DOCTOR,

31:17.006 --> 31:18.207
AND NOT A FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

31:18.207 --> 31:19.909
AND MY JOB IS
HIS SURGICAL SKILL,

31:19.909 --> 31:21.480
NOT HIS PERSONALITY.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.082
♪♪♪

31:23.082 --> 31:24.483
(typing)

31:24.483 --> 31:26.655
(pager beeps)

31:28.217 --> 31:29.388
(exhales deeply)

31:29.388 --> 31:30.559
(door opens and closes)

31:30.559 --> 31:32.591
(indistinct conversations)

31:32.591 --> 31:34.063
TALK TO ME, ROSS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:34.063 --> 31:36.025
NATHAN'S O-2 SATS
ARE STABLE, SO...

31:36.025 --> 31:38.597
DR. ROSS SAYS
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

31:38.597 --> 31:43.032
IT'S AN EXCELLENT SIGN.

31:43.032 --> 31:44.073
HE CAN COME OFF
THE OSCILLATOR.

31:44.073 --> 31:45.935
(crying) IT'S WORKING?

31:45.935 --> 31:48.978
I THINK SO.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.941
(gasps)

32:03.322 --> 32:05.024
(both) YES!

32:12.661 --> 32:13.963
(types)

32:13.963 --> 32:16.105
(Jimmy) HELEN!

32:18.667 --> 32:20.109
JIMMY.
WHERE ARE THE CAR KEYS?

32:20.109 --> 32:21.610
YOU DIDN'T GET ALEX.

32:21.610 --> 32:23.212
JIMMY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET'S JUST TAKE YOU--

32:23.212 --> 32:24.713
HE'S--HE'S STILL OUT THERE
WAITING.

32:24.713 --> 32:26.645
YOU SAID YOU'D GET HIM.
I COME HOME,

32:26.645 --> 32:28.447
YOU'RE JUST SITTING
ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR!

32:28.447 --> 32:30.079
ALEX IS ALL RIGHT,
JIMMY. LI--

32:30.079 --> 32:31.550
IT'S AFTER DARK!
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE!

32:31.550 --> 32:33.052
(gasping)
YOU STUPID--

32:33.052 --> 32:34.283
LEAVE HER ALONE!

32:34.283 --> 32:36.085
(groaning)

32:36.085 --> 32:36.986
GET OUT OF HERE!

32:36.986 --> 32:39.628
GO!

32:43.732 --> 32:44.593
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO GET YOU.
I WAS AFRAID YOU--

32:44.593 --> 32:45.594
JUST SHUT UP!

32:45.594 --> 32:47.666
ALEX, PLEASE! ALEX, DON'T!

32:47.666 --> 32:50.499
GO SLEEP IT OFF!

32:50.499 --> 32:53.642
(groaning)
COME ON.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.504
GO GET SOME SLEEP.

32:55.504 --> 32:57.376
(objects clatter)

33:03.612 --> 33:05.584
YOU OKAY?

33:05.584 --> 33:07.456
YEAH.

33:08.517 --> 33:10.659
I'M SORRY.

33:10.659 --> 33:13.162
WHY ARE YOU SORRY?
HE'S A JUNKIE.

33:13.162 --> 33:14.523
SHE WAS CRAZY.

33:14.523 --> 33:17.596
I STARTED RUNNING INTERFERENCE
FOR THEM WHEN I WAS 6.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.198
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE.

33:21.430 --> 33:24.633
I'M JUST ASKING
FOR ONE MORE TIME.

33:24.633 --> 33:26.575
LAST TIME, I SWEAR.

33:26.575 --> 33:29.608
IF YOU WANNA GO,
WE CAN JUST--
JOHN, HUSH.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.281
FINE, YOU WANNA WASTE
YOUR TIME?

33:32.281 --> 33:33.642
I DON'T CARE.

33:33.642 --> 33:36.515
ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.587
ACTUALLY, JOHN,
WE NEED YOU HERE.

33:38.587 --> 33:41.250
YOU'RE GONNA STAND
RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

33:41.250 --> 33:42.421
OKAY.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.123
WHEN YOU'RE THIRSTY,

33:44.123 --> 33:47.056
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT
MOVING YOUR FINGERS,

33:47.056 --> 33:48.527
OR GRASPING THE CUP.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.799
YOU JUST GET A DRINK,

33:50.799 --> 33:53.662
AND THE REST FOLLOWS.

33:53.662 --> 33:56.805
BECCA, I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AT JOHN.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.370
HI.

34:05.674 --> 34:06.645
WHEN DO I MOVE THE HAND?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.117
YOU DON'T.

34:08.117 --> 34:10.119
JUST LOOK AT JOHN.

34:10.119 --> 34:12.521
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU
WANT TO SAY TO HIM.

34:12.521 --> 34:14.823
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

34:14.823 --> 34:16.485
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

34:20.429 --> 34:23.592
(whirring)

34:23.592 --> 34:26.064
DID IT JUST...

34:26.064 --> 34:27.666
SHH.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.800
LOOK AT JOHN.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.742
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SAY TO HIM?

34:33.742 --> 34:34.843
(exhales)

34:34.843 --> 34:38.107
(whirring continues)

34:41.680 --> 34:43.812
OH.

34:51.660 --> 34:53.422
(voice breaking)
BECCA...

34:53.422 --> 34:56.425
BECCA, YOU TOUCHED ME.

34:56.425 --> 35:00.569
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D DO THAT AGAIN.

35:03.532 --> 35:07.406
ME NEITHER.

35:07.406 --> 35:11.180
(sniffles)
OH, I'M SORRY.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.512
(sniffles)

35:16.445 --> 35:18.647
(Kimmie) OH! YOU ARE
GONNA LOVE THAT THING.

35:18.647 --> 35:20.549
I USE MINE ALL THE TIME.

35:20.549 --> 35:21.650
(April) GREAT!

35:21.650 --> 35:22.891
IT'S A SALAD SPINNER.

35:22.891 --> 35:24.893
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES.

35:24.893 --> 35:28.657
BUT THE GUY AT THE STORE
RECOMMENDED IT AND...

35:28.657 --> 35:30.429
THE RECEIPT IS ON THE BACK.
THANK YOU, MER.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.500
OOH, ANOTHER BOW.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.501
WHO'S MAKING
THE RIBBON BOUQUET?

35:32.501 --> 35:33.662
OOH, HEY, YAY.

35:33.662 --> 35:35.564
SO SHE CAN CARRY IT
AT THE REHEARSAL.

35:35.564 --> 35:36.635
SUPER FUN.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.806
OOH, WE ARE LATE.

35:37.806 --> 35:39.738
DO YOU THINK SHE NOTICED
THAT WE'RE LATE?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.740
I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE KNOWS WE'RE INVITED.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.871
WHAT DID WE MISS?

35:42.871 --> 35:45.874
(muffled) UM, GARLIC PRESS,
COFFEE MAKER,

35:45.874 --> 35:47.546
AND A DELICIOUS
TRAY OF BRUSCHETTA.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.777
OH, BEAUTIFUL!

35:48.777 --> 35:50.148
(women cooing)
(Lorde's "Team" playing)

35:50.148 --> 35:51.550
DID YOU EVEN SEE
WHAT SHE GOT?

35:51.550 --> 35:52.581
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

35:52.581 --> 35:54.253
AS LONG AS YOU SAY
SOMETHING NICE.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.554
YOU GOTTA TRY
THE QUICHE.

35:55.554 --> 35:56.625
LOVELY!

35:56.625 --> 35:58.156
LOVE IT.
FANTASTIC!

35:58.156 --> 36:00.689
OKAY, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ONE IS FROM YOUR SISTERS.

36:00.689 --> 36:02.331
OH, NO, NOT THAT ONE.

36:02.331 --> 36:04.663
WE WANTED TO SAVE THAT ONE,
DUCKIE, TO OPEN IN PRIVATE.

36:04.663 --> 36:09.167
OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS,
YOU--YOU ACTUALLY REMEMBERED?

36:09.167 --> 36:10.299
(exhales) YOU REMEMBERED

36:10.299 --> 36:11.770
HOW MUCH I WANNA
WEAR MOM'S VEIL?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.542
NO, WE DIDN'T--
GRAB IT, ALICE!

36:13.542 --> 36:15.604
(Alice) I'M TRYING, STOP!

IT'S NOT.

36:20.749 --> 36:21.880

36:21.880 --> 36:23.582
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR LATER.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.655
BUT SINCE
YOU'VE OPENED IT...
SURPRISE!

36:26.655 --> 36:27.686
IT'S FOR YOUR WEDDING NIGHT,

36:27.686 --> 36:29.558

YOU AND MATTHEW... (hums)

WE ALL HAD OUR FIRST TIMES,
TOO, RIGHT, LADIES?

36:34.563 --> 36:36.665
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU
THE LINGERIE AND SOME TIPS.

36:36.665 --> 36:39.528
THE PEARLS, BY THE WAY,
ARE FOR THE INSIDE--
STOP. JUST STOP TALKING.

36:39.528 --> 36:41.430
I--
BUT MATTHEW IS YOUR FIRST
REAL BOYFRIEND.

36:41.430 --> 36:42.571
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP.
PLEASE, DON'T.

36:42.571 --> 36:43.832

36:43.832 --> 36:45.634
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD WITH MEN.

NO, SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY TRACK RECORD.

A BOYFRIEND, I WAS LIKE,

SUDDEN MOVEMENTS."
