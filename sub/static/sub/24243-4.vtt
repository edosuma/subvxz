00:53.775 --> 00:55.743
Hey, you OK?

00:57.446 --> 00:59.246
Yeah.

00:59.247 --> 01:01.315
It's just a nightmare.

01:03.251 --> 01:05.453
- Go back to sleep.
- Same one?

01:09.057 --> 01:11.258
- Yeah.
- You ever think that maybe

01:11.259 --> 01:14.261
opening up your dad's old case right now
might not be the best thing for you?

01:14.262 --> 01:16.797
Get someone else to do it.

01:16.798 --> 01:20.034
Jack or... hell, I don't know, Donnie?

01:22.004 --> 01:24.305
I can handle it.

01:24.306 --> 01:26.674
Yeah, but what about the rest of us?

01:28.677 --> 01:30.678
I gotta get up.

01:30.679 --> 01:33.514
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

01:40.188 --> 01:42.389
Hey.

01:48.797 --> 01:50.865
Katherine Jean Hall,
what do you think you're doing?

01:50.866 --> 01:53.300
What?! Margot's mom
lets her drink coffee.

01:53.301 --> 01:56.570
Well, you can talk to Margot's
mom when you don't get any taller.

02:01.076 --> 02:02.810
Bye, Mom.

02:02.811 --> 02:05.946
Have a good day.
Hey, you know where your bro...

02:08.383 --> 02:11.485
Nate, come on, it's time for...

02:17.392 --> 02:20.161
Mom, this is a crime scene and I died.

02:20.162 --> 02:22.196
You're ruining the game!

02:22.197 --> 02:24.165
- No, the game is over!
- Get off!

02:24.166 --> 02:26.426
You're taking it too far!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

02:29.571 --> 02:31.939
Stevie!

02:31.940 --> 02:34.141
Nate, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

02:34.142 --> 02:36.444
I'm so sorry. Nate! Nate!

02:36.445 --> 02:38.479
What the hell are you doing?

02:38.480 --> 02:41.215
I-I-I-I don't know what you saw.

02:41.216 --> 02:43.717
Yeah, me neither.

02:43.718 --> 02:45.953
I'm gonna call Dr. Stone.
I think we need a session.

02:45.954 --> 02:48.956
- No. It wasn't Nate's fault.
- I'm not calling about him.

03:00.168 --> 03:02.903
- What have we got?
- A teenager.

03:02.904 --> 03:04.939
City workers noticed
the car just left here,

03:04.940 --> 03:07.341
- called the police.
- Officer on the scene

03:07.342 --> 03:09.410
noticed blood on the bumper,
opened the trunk

03:09.411 --> 03:11.345
- and found her inside.
- How bad?

03:11.346 --> 03:13.347
It's bad. Stabbed repeatedly.

03:13.348 --> 03:15.316
Post-mortem will give us
a cause of death.

03:15.317 --> 03:17.251
We got an ID.

03:17.252 --> 03:19.286
Not yet. We're running a VIN number.

03:19.287 --> 03:20.178
You're ready?

03:20.179 --> 03:22.289
Yeah. Can you and Hall
conduct a thorough search

03:22.290 --> 03:24.291
- of this car?
- Sure. Where is Stevie?

03:24.292 --> 03:26.293
Funny, I was just about to ask you.

03:26.294 --> 03:28.295
How's that for a turn of event?

03:28.296 --> 03:30.664
So how are you today, Detective?
You're feeling OK?

03:40.976 --> 03:43.010
You're late. Everything OK?

03:43.011 --> 03:46.046
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

03:55.624 --> 03:57.691
Medusa was almost

03:57.692 --> 04:00.127
downright courteous to Cooper here.

04:00.128 --> 04:02.029
I get it; Only you
get to call her that?

04:02.030 --> 04:04.031
Nobody gets to call her that.

04:04.032 --> 04:06.033
What do you know
about the victim's injuries?

04:06.034 --> 04:08.369
She can't be older than 16.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.638
I'm getting tired
of seeing these dead girls.

04:10.639 --> 04:13.974
Um, nails are chipped.
Signs of a struggle.

04:13.975 --> 04:15.976
I bet she felt like a million bucks

04:15.977 --> 04:18.245
when she had those done.

04:20.281 --> 04:22.550
There appears to be bruising

04:22.551 --> 04:25.519
to the upper inner-thigh area.

04:28.723 --> 04:30.724
What happened to you, honey?

04:30.725 --> 04:33.194
Jesus!

04:33.195 --> 04:36.397
- She's still alive!
- Over here!

04:43.405 --> 04:46.807
The medics
didn't check her vitals.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.310
OK. Thank you.

04:49.311 --> 04:52.413
Let me guess, Coroner
Phelps is retiring early?

04:52.414 --> 04:54.582
With a little help from me
and my friends upstairs.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.551
The girl was VSA,
miracle she's still breathing.

04:57.552 --> 05:00.487
- The miracle is if she lives.
- So what does that mean

05:00.488 --> 05:02.923
for us, Boss? No body.
I assume you're kicking it over

05:02.924 --> 05:05.359
- to Special Victims?
- No, I think we're gonna

05:05.360 --> 05:07.928
follow through on this
until further notice, OK?

05:07.929 --> 05:09.735
Aaron, you want to head
to the hospital, keep us posted.

05:09.736 --> 05:12.366
You got it.

05:14.603 --> 05:16.604
I know that look.

05:16.605 --> 05:19.306
- What look?
- That I-have-a-secret look.

05:19.307 --> 05:21.308
Me? Nooo.

05:21.309 --> 05:24.211
Come on, Cooper, cough it up.

05:24.212 --> 05:26.146
I mean, I don't have a secret.

05:26.147 --> 05:28.082
Well, I mean, I do,

05:28.083 --> 05:31.585
but you know what it is.
The baby.

05:31.586 --> 05:35.589
Right, of course, the baby.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.725
So does that mean
that you're having it then?

05:37.726 --> 05:39.994
Yeah.

05:39.995 --> 05:42.062
Yeah, I think I am.

05:43.965 --> 05:46.600
Then, congratulations.

05:46.601 --> 05:49.603
Thanks! I feel pretty good about it.

05:49.604 --> 05:52.006
It's good that you feel good.

05:52.007 --> 05:53.907
Yeah.

05:56.811 --> 05:59.013
- What's that?
- A parking pass

05:59.014 --> 06:01.282
from last night.
Scarborough Conversation Park.

06:01.283 --> 06:03.817
Now, what was a teenage girl
doing there?

06:03.818 --> 06:06.153
Well, it's a popular make-out spot.

06:06.154 --> 06:07.454
Is it?

06:07.455 --> 06:09.423
Yes.

06:09.424 --> 06:10.924
Ladies,

06:10.925 --> 06:13.294
VIN confirms that the car
belongs to a Thomas Williams.

06:13.295 --> 06:16.063
Reported his daughter missing
this morning, Deana Williams.

06:16.064 --> 06:19.133
Um, I want you to report
to the family,

06:19.134 --> 06:21.101
deliver notification.

06:21.102 --> 06:23.804
- But there's no death.
- Just got off the phone

06:23.805 --> 06:25.773
with Erin. She didn't make it.

06:45.627 --> 06:48.295
Mr. Williams? Can we come in?

06:53.968 --> 06:56.203
So you're here about Dee?

06:56.204 --> 06:58.539
- Where is she?
- Did you find her?

06:58.540 --> 07:01.642
Do you have a wife, Mr. Williams?

07:01.643 --> 07:04.144
It's probably best
if we do this all together.

07:05.714 --> 07:09.216
My wife... My wife passed a year ago.

07:09.217 --> 07:11.552
It was cancer.

07:14.222 --> 07:17.991
This is gonna be very hard to hear.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.094
We found your car this morning.

07:20.095 --> 07:22.730
Yeah, so where's Deana?

07:22.731 --> 07:24.998
A girl matching
your daughter's description

07:24.999 --> 07:27.134
was found on scene.

07:28.870 --> 07:30.838
But she's OK though, right?

07:30.839 --> 07:34.341
Unfortunately, the girl we found

07:34.342 --> 07:36.176
died on the way to the hospital.

07:36.177 --> 07:38.879
- Deana's dead?
- No.

07:41.082 --> 07:43.083
You got the wrong girl.

07:43.084 --> 07:45.419
My daughter's just gone somewhere.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.422
She's, And frankly,

07:48.423 --> 07:50.457
I don't know why you guys aren't
out there looking for her.

07:50.458 --> 07:53.460
We are very sorry, Mr. Williams.

07:53.461 --> 07:55.763
Tell me my daughter isn't dead.

07:55.764 --> 07:58.532
What happened to her?

07:58.533 --> 08:00.167
Simon...

08:01.870 --> 08:03.871
No.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.410
How do you even know
that this girl is Deana?

08:09.411 --> 08:12.312
Since she was found in your car,

08:12.313 --> 08:14.448
it's very likely that it's her.

08:16.217 --> 08:17.951
I'm so sorry.

08:20.755 --> 08:22.556
Just...

08:24.492 --> 08:26.627
Just give me a minute.

08:26.628 --> 08:29.930
I need a minute to think.

08:29.931 --> 08:32.633
I just, I just... Give me a minute.

08:32.634 --> 08:35.235
Just give me a minute, OK? I just...

08:39.573 --> 08:41.808
Was...

08:45.380 --> 08:47.080
Was she...?

08:47.081 --> 08:50.117
There are indications
that she was assaulted, yes.

08:50.118 --> 08:52.119
God!

08:52.120 --> 08:54.755
Mr. Williams,
let's confirm it's Deana first

08:54.756 --> 08:57.524
before we...
before we go any further, OK?

08:57.525 --> 09:00.427
In order to do that, we need
you to come down to the station

09:00.428 --> 09:02.930
- to identify the body.
- Wait. Right,

09:02.931 --> 09:06.099
just in-in-in case
it's not her, right?

09:07.969 --> 09:10.537
Simon, why don't you come
with me for a minute.

09:23.384 --> 09:26.720
I know this is very hard
to process, Mr. Williams,

09:26.721 --> 09:29.556
but I still have a few questions
that I need to ask.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.461
OK.

09:34.462 --> 09:37.297
Do you know
who Deana was with last night?

09:37.298 --> 09:39.566
I don't know.

09:42.770 --> 09:46.273
We had a fight.

09:46.274 --> 09:48.842
Because she quit her...

09:48.843 --> 09:51.645
her tutoring job, and...

09:56.150 --> 09:58.652
I lost my temper and then...

10:01.523 --> 10:03.524
I pushed her.

10:03.525 --> 10:06.293
I have never done that before.

10:26.838 --> 10:28.095
Yeah, they were fighting.

10:28.096 --> 10:29.997
She quit her job, it's understandable.

10:29.998 --> 10:32.633
He didn't even notice she was
missing until this morning.

10:32.634 --> 10:35.102
- He thought she came home late.
- I know.

10:35.103 --> 10:37.604
I don't have a kid yet, so
I don't get an opinion, right?

10:37.605 --> 10:41.308
You said that, not me.

10:51.252 --> 10:54.355
So far, no one recognizes Deana.
Anything?

10:54.356 --> 10:56.724
Only if you count an alien abduction.

10:56.725 --> 10:58.726
- You?
- Nada.

10:58.727 --> 11:02.663
But if you see
a Grey tabby with three legs,

11:02.664 --> 11:04.465
- he's called Phillip.
- Awww.

11:04.466 --> 11:07.034
I had a dog with three legs,
growing up. Cheeto.

11:07.035 --> 11:09.870
My dad would try to make him
a leg out of a tennis racket

11:09.871 --> 11:12.940
- when he was drunk.
- You truly are a success story.

11:14.976 --> 11:16.977
You talked to them yet?

11:16.978 --> 11:19.913
Doesn't look like anybody's
talked to them in three months.

11:19.914 --> 11:23.217
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

11:31.860 --> 11:34.695
Hello? Police! Open up!

11:39.067 --> 11:41.101
It's the police!

11:41.102 --> 11:43.337
Drop your weapon and come out
with your hands up!

11:43.338 --> 11:44.972
Now, asshat!

12:10.064 --> 12:13.100
God, I hate nature!

12:13.101 --> 12:15.102
Stupid racoon!

12:17.238 --> 12:20.307
Some heavy-duty bleaching.

12:26.948 --> 12:30.083
Yes. You know, they say

12:30.084 --> 12:32.386
the true sign of a great home
business is when the owner

12:32.387 --> 12:35.289
uses the product himself.

12:35.290 --> 12:38.425
Still good.
Someone's been here recently.

12:38.426 --> 12:41.061
Looks like someone's been
living here recently.

12:43.031 --> 12:46.133
- Where are the cushions?
- Between that and the bleach,

12:46.134 --> 12:47.801
they've been trying to cover up.

12:47.802 --> 12:50.404
This looks like Deana's.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.406
They didn't get everything.

12:52.407 --> 12:55.008
- I'm calling Forensics.
- Yeah.

12:57.979 --> 13:00.581
Camper belongs to Matt Chatland, 43.

13:00.582 --> 13:03.750
- Aggravated assault, burglary.
- Just finished a three-month stint

13:03.751 --> 13:05.752
at Montclair. Out on good behaviour.

13:05.753 --> 13:07.469
He's been selling pot
to the teens in the

13:07.470 --> 13:09.089
park. We think that's
how he met Deana.

13:09.090 --> 13:11.492
I hate him already.
Any other links to Deana?

13:11.493 --> 13:13.494
Forensics searched the camper

13:13.495 --> 13:15.462
at Scarborough Conversation Park,

13:15.463 --> 13:17.464
Luminol revealed

13:17.465 --> 13:19.466
blood that he tried to clean up
with bleach, a lot of it.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.369
Next time, start there.

13:22.370 --> 13:25.372
- Is the blood hers?
- We're still waiting to hear back.

13:25.373 --> 13:27.341
In the meantime,

13:27.342 --> 13:29.343
why don't we pick him up,
see if we can get him to talk.

13:29.344 --> 13:31.845
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.
Where do we find him?

13:31.846 --> 13:34.181
A uni sitting on the camper
says he hasn't come back yet,

13:34.182 --> 13:35.983
but we have the wife's
last known address so

13:35.984 --> 13:37.651
we're gonna see if
she's able to tell us.

13:37.652 --> 13:39.453
Good. Well, let's see what she says.

13:39.454 --> 13:41.688
Donnie, Aaron, see if you dig up
some more dirt on Chatland.

13:41.689 --> 13:44.725
Price, you're with me.
Let's solve this, shall we?

13:44.726 --> 13:46.793
Yeah.

13:51.499 --> 13:54.668
Mr. Williams.

13:54.669 --> 13:56.670
Simon. I'm Detective sergeant Price.

13:56.671 --> 13:58.672
This is Staff Inspector Currie.

13:58.673 --> 14:01.041
We are so sorry
for your loss, Mr. Williams,

14:01.042 --> 14:03.043
and we are doing

14:03.044 --> 14:05.045
- everything in our power...
- Did you find

14:05.046 --> 14:07.047
- the son of a bitch who did this?
- We're in the process

14:07.048 --> 14:09.483
- of locating him.
- So he's still out there?

14:09.484 --> 14:12.553
- Yes, sir, yes.
- But rest assured

14:12.554 --> 14:14.655
that the men and women
of this unit are doing

14:14.656 --> 14:16.723
everything they can
to bring him to justice

14:16.724 --> 14:18.959
for what he did to Deana.

14:22.297 --> 14:24.331
Are you ready to see
your daughter now?

14:41.349 --> 14:44.084
- Fiona?
- Yep.

14:44.085 --> 14:46.787
OK, we got you. Here. We've got you.

14:49.257 --> 14:51.358
- There's no air in here.
- Yeah.

14:51.359 --> 14:54.595
I need some air. I can't breathe.

14:54.596 --> 14:58.265
Take a deep breath.

14:58.266 --> 15:00.367
There you go.

15:03.071 --> 15:05.105
I know this is hard, Thomas,

15:05.106 --> 15:07.608
but I need you to try.

15:07.609 --> 15:09.610
I need your official identification

15:09.611 --> 15:11.612
before we can proceed further.

15:11.613 --> 15:15.348
I don't think I can do it.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.620
- It's OK, Dad.
- I can't see my baby girl

15:19.621 --> 15:21.622
on that table. I can't see

15:21.623 --> 15:23.624
- my baby girl on that table.
- I'll go.

15:23.625 --> 15:27.294
- No, no. Hang on.
- Look at him.

15:27.295 --> 15:29.596
- You think he could do it?
- We...

15:29.597 --> 15:33.000
Can I have a word in private?

15:33.001 --> 15:34.735
Excuse me.

15:37.238 --> 15:39.239
I know you didn't ask
for my opinion but...

15:39.240 --> 15:41.375
- Then why are you giving it?
- Clearly, the father is

15:41.376 --> 15:43.343
in no state; I don't think we
should force him to go in there.

15:43.344 --> 15:45.779
I am not sending a child in
to ID his dead sister.

15:45.780 --> 15:47.614
Why not?

15:47.615 --> 15:50.217
The kid's ready to go in;
The father isn't.

15:50.218 --> 15:52.219
I don't see what the problem is.
We don't get this,

15:52.220 --> 15:55.589
- we don't move forward.
- Please.

15:55.590 --> 15:59.159
Dad watched Mom waste away
to nothing...

15:59.160 --> 16:01.294
he can't do this again.

16:03.131 --> 16:05.065
I'm begging you.

16:05.066 --> 16:07.267
Let me go in.

16:42.613 --> 16:43.861
No.

16:43.862 --> 16:46.839
No. No. Daddy, no!

16:47.723 --> 16:51.058
You OK? Thought I was the
one with morning sickness.

16:52.728 --> 16:54.662
Don't know what's up with me today.

16:54.663 --> 16:58.432
Why don't you hang back. Just
keep an eye on the perimeter.

16:58.433 --> 17:00.434
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, of course.

17:00.435 --> 17:02.236
No worries.

17:14.648 --> 17:16.784
- Is your mom home?
- Cole, who's that?

17:16.785 --> 17:19.487
Detective Jac Cooper. Need to
speak with you, Mrs. Chatland.

17:19.488 --> 17:22.348
No, you can't be here.
You gotta get out of here.

17:22.349 --> 17:23.528
What happened to your face?

17:23.529 --> 17:26.131
I told you not to open
that damn door!

17:28.233 --> 17:31.002
Chatland's here, I need backup now!

17:31.003 --> 17:33.171
He didn't do anything.

17:57.663 --> 18:00.131
Argh!

18:02.568 --> 18:06.404
- You're alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:08.874 --> 18:10.875
- I'm fine.
- You bitches,

18:10.876 --> 18:13.511
you got nothing on me!

18:18.484 --> 18:20.618
Are you certain you can do this?

18:24.490 --> 18:26.558
OK.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.700
Is that her?

18:35.701 --> 18:37.936
Is this your sister?

18:41.073 --> 18:43.041
Yes or no, Simon.

18:45.077 --> 18:47.312
- Yeah.
- OK.

18:47.313 --> 18:50.215
That's her.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.517
- Yeah.
- OK.

18:52.518 --> 18:55.820
That's Deana.

18:55.821 --> 18:58.690
Are they gonna cut her open now?

18:58.691 --> 19:00.792
They're gonna do
the autopsy there, yes.

19:00.793 --> 19:03.828
- OK. Good work, let's go.
- No.

19:03.829 --> 19:05.797
- No, we can't stay here.
- I wanna stay with her!

19:05.798 --> 19:08.266
We really have to go now.

19:12.038 --> 19:14.005
I didn't do anything

19:14.006 --> 19:16.541
to that girl. I don't even know her.

19:16.542 --> 19:18.543
Are you sure?

19:18.544 --> 19:20.378
Maybe you sold her some weed. I mean,

19:20.379 --> 19:23.014
you can't remember every kid
you sold a dime bag to, can you?

19:23.015 --> 19:23.986
No.

19:23.987 --> 19:26.087
Pretty sure I'd remember
if I killed one though.

19:28.090 --> 19:30.592
Look, I sell a bit of dope, big deal.

19:33.396 --> 19:35.530
Is this your car, Mr. Chatland?

19:37.433 --> 19:39.434
We spoke to Security
at Deana's high school;

19:39.435 --> 19:41.970
They said this car was
parked up front every day

19:41.971 --> 19:45.273
for a month or so. 3 p.m. on the dot.

19:45.274 --> 19:48.810
- Were you watching Deana?
- My kids go to that school.

19:48.811 --> 19:52.080
Security says you never picked
anyone up,

19:52.081 --> 19:55.317
just sat there looking
at all the pretty, little girls

19:55.318 --> 19:57.419
out the window
'til they asked you to leave.

19:57.420 --> 19:59.754
I was trying to get my kids

19:59.755 --> 20:02.624
to convince their dumb mother
to let me back in the house.

20:02.625 --> 20:06.328
So have you been living
in your camper? You're homeless?

20:06.329 --> 20:08.263
Camper's a home on wheels, isn't it?

20:08.264 --> 20:10.231
Are you aware we found

20:10.232 --> 20:12.267
residue of blood in that camper?

20:12.268 --> 20:14.436
That's not possible.

20:16.005 --> 20:18.440
You said that your wife
won't let you come back home,

20:18.441 --> 20:20.775
but she did let you
sleep over yesterday, correct?

20:20.776 --> 20:23.645
- Yeah. I pay for the damn place.
- Your wife says

20:23.646 --> 20:25.680
you disappeared last night,

20:25.681 --> 20:28.283
returned early this morning.
Can you explain where you were?

20:28.284 --> 20:31.186
Nowhere. I was on that couch.

20:31.187 --> 20:33.855
What would she have to gain
from lying, Mr. Chatland?

20:33.856 --> 20:36.558
I don't know. Bitches lie.

20:43.132 --> 20:45.033
- What's that?
- Bank records.

20:45.034 --> 20:47.035
Apparently, at 1:30 this morning,

20:47.036 --> 20:50.839
you made a stop at Sunshine
Convenience to buy cigarettes.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.941
Now, can you explain to me
how you managed

20:52.942 --> 20:55.310
to make that purchase
from your wife's couch?

20:56.979 --> 20:58.813
Alright.

20:58.814 --> 21:02.017
I'm not going down for this.
I wanna talk to somebody.

21:02.018 --> 21:04.986
'Til I do, I got no further comment.

21:12.579 --> 21:14.613
Did someone do that to you?

21:14.614 --> 21:17.383
It's a... No, I'm...

21:17.384 --> 21:20.419
I'm just a klutz;
I fell down the front steps.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.454
You're sure Matt didn't do it?

21:27.327 --> 21:29.328
What about you, Vanessa?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.564
Did somebody hurt you?

21:31.565 --> 21:33.566
Was it your dad?

21:33.567 --> 21:35.768
I don't remember.

21:37.370 --> 21:39.438
Do you know where Matt was last night?

21:43.176 --> 21:45.878
Could you take Cole and Vanessa

21:45.879 --> 21:47.847
to the vending machine, please?

21:47.848 --> 21:51.317
Thank you.

21:58.603 --> 22:00.437
Was Matt with you last night?

22:00.438 --> 22:03.340
He's been wanting
to get back together.

22:03.341 --> 22:06.810
- I was weak, so...
- You let him sleep over?

22:08.579 --> 22:11.048
We had a couple of beers,
so I gave him the couch.

22:11.049 --> 22:14.518
I went to bed early. I got up to pee,

22:14.519 --> 22:17.287
- he was gone.
- Do you know where he went?

22:17.288 --> 22:19.156
I didn't ask.

22:19.157 --> 22:22.225
He stumbled in later
demanding to use the shower.

22:22.226 --> 22:24.995
I... I was pretty sure

22:24.996 --> 22:28.165
- he'd been up to no good.
- Do you think it's possible

22:28.166 --> 22:31.201
he could have gone back to the camper?

22:31.202 --> 22:33.804
We know that he sells drugs
to the kids in the park.

22:33.805 --> 22:37.774
Beats me.

22:37.775 --> 22:40.744
His keys were on the table
when I woke up this morning.

22:40.745 --> 22:42.879
Right.

22:44.849 --> 22:46.883
Mrs. Chatland,
if what you're saying

22:46.884 --> 22:49.152
is true, then your house

22:49.153 --> 22:51.555
is a potential crime scene.
We'll have to search it.

22:51.556 --> 22:54.925
- Why? Didn't do nothing wrong.
- I know, I know.

22:54.926 --> 22:58.628
It's protocol.
Do you have somewhere else

22:58.629 --> 23:00.764
that you can stay
until we've cleared the space?

23:00.765 --> 23:02.766
Can't we go back
to get our stuff first?

23:02.767 --> 23:04.701
I can get an officer

23:04.702 --> 23:06.903
to bring you whatever you want.

23:06.904 --> 23:10.073
I will also need any keys
that you have for the property.

23:13.044 --> 23:15.746
You don't have to protect him anymore.

23:15.747 --> 23:17.881
You're safe now. We've got you.

23:20.151 --> 23:22.686
I just want to do right by my kids.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.688
I know.

23:24.689 --> 23:26.690
And this is the first step.

23:36.868 --> 23:39.002
Thank you.

23:50.948 --> 23:52.949
We're gonna search the Chatland house.

23:52.950 --> 23:56.219
Good. I want this bastard.
Stevie, hang on.

23:56.220 --> 23:58.355
Wanna sit down for a second.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.363
So you wanna tell me about your field
trip to Flowers' place last week?

24:08.065 --> 24:11.301
- I should have cleared it with you.
- Yeah, I agree, but you didn't.

24:11.302 --> 24:14.871
And it made it really difficult for
me to clarify with the superintendent

24:14.872 --> 24:16.740
why you were investigating him
without clearance.

24:16.741 --> 24:18.942
'Cause it seems Flowers

24:18.943 --> 24:20.844
- didn't take too kindly to it.
- Yeah. No, let me

24:20.845 --> 24:24.014
- just exp...
- No. Just let me finish.

24:24.015 --> 24:26.082
Are you aware that Price already has

24:26.083 --> 24:28.251
several citations against him
for harassing Flowers?

24:28.252 --> 24:30.720
He's on our team. He's a good cop!

24:30.721 --> 24:33.156
Yeah, but he is not you.

24:33.157 --> 24:35.292
And trust me when I say,

24:35.293 --> 24:38.762
all this Grey area you're in,
this off-book stuff,

24:38.763 --> 24:40.797
you will wear it worse than he will.

24:40.798 --> 24:43.433
- Because I'm a woman?
- No.

24:43.434 --> 24:45.836
Stevie.

24:45.837 --> 24:48.104
Because of what this case
did to your dad.

24:50.107 --> 24:52.442
Why investigate Flowers now?

24:54.779 --> 24:56.780
Because Brooke Dodson's
disappearance is linked

24:56.781 --> 24:58.782
- to my dad's case.
- Are you sure about that?

24:58.783 --> 25:01.117
- Have a very good feeling, yes.
- Yeah, feeling is not the same

25:01.118 --> 25:03.053
- as evidence.
- What we're trying to find.

25:04.689 --> 25:07.123
Alright. Until you do,

25:07.124 --> 25:09.526
let's just focus on the active cases.

25:11.829 --> 25:13.830
Can I get a full report on that house?

25:13.831 --> 25:16.533
Thank you.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.254
Fiona knows
about the stakeout at Flowers;

25:21.255 --> 25:23.223
Has she talked to you about it yet?

25:23.224 --> 25:25.391
No. But you can add that
to an already winning day.

25:25.392 --> 25:28.528
I felt we should get our story
straight before she does.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.199
What story, Stevie?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.935
We staked out that piece of
crap's garbage hole of a story.

25:35.936 --> 25:38.076
You went in, I stayed
in the car. No problem, right?

25:39.740 --> 25:41.235
Anything else? I gotta
call the Williams

25:41.236 --> 25:42.609
family to make sure they got home OK.

25:42.610 --> 25:45.879
No, that's it.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.914
I heard that the brother
took the ID hard.

25:47.915 --> 25:51.718
- Yeah, he did.
- How did you take it?

25:57.091 --> 25:59.259
Where do we stand
on Matt Chatland?

25:59.260 --> 26:02.095
We have him for another 18 hours.
He's talking to a lawyer now.

26:02.096 --> 26:05.298
Well, let's head over to the house,
see what we can find in the meantime.

26:05.299 --> 26:07.967
- Are you sure you're up for it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

26:19.213 --> 26:23.149
Who even uses photo albums anymore?

26:23.150 --> 26:26.853
Cute kids, they look happy.

26:26.854 --> 26:29.556
So did me and my brother.
Doesn't mean it was true.

26:29.557 --> 26:31.958
Oof!

26:31.959 --> 26:34.260
They're not loving school.

26:34.261 --> 26:36.429
Cole's failing everything.

26:38.332 --> 26:41.467
- Am I gonna suck as a mom?
- What?

26:41.468 --> 26:43.603
No more than the rest of us do.

26:43.604 --> 26:45.705
When I took Matt down, I didn't think

26:45.706 --> 26:48.508
about being pregnant once.
I just wanted to kick his ass.

26:48.509 --> 26:51.177
Which you did.
Impressively I might add.

26:51.178 --> 26:54.180
Right. So I could go
toe to toe with Rhonda Rousey,

26:54.181 --> 26:56.216
- but I'll be a terrible mother.
- Who?

26:56.217 --> 26:59.786
You're just freaking out.

26:59.787 --> 27:01.788
No, I'm not.

27:01.789 --> 27:05.458
Yes, you are. You'll be fine.

27:05.459 --> 27:08.061
Fine? I still eat Fun Dip.

27:11.365 --> 27:14.200
I slapped Nate this morning.

27:14.201 --> 27:16.369
Across the face.

27:16.370 --> 27:20.373
And I felt sick about it all day.

27:20.374 --> 27:23.042
We all suck at it

27:23.043 --> 27:25.645
in one way or another.

27:25.646 --> 27:27.747
It's life.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.218
Guys, we found this
buried in the garden.

27:34.221 --> 27:36.556
That could be blood.

27:36.557 --> 27:39.259
I'll call the boss.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.327
Judging by the condition of the shirt,

27:41.328 --> 27:43.296
it looks quite weathered.

27:43.297 --> 27:46.900
And the blood stains...
It couldn't be Deana Williams.

27:46.901 --> 27:48.935
- Why?
- They look too old.

27:50.571 --> 27:53.072
OK, let's run this up to Biology,

27:53.073 --> 27:55.141
find out exactly
how old these stains are

27:55.142 --> 27:57.877
and see if they develop
a DNA profile for the donor.

27:57.878 --> 28:00.580
Because unless this blood
belongs to someone

28:00.581 --> 28:03.216
in the Chatland family, we might
be looking at a second victim.

28:09.794 --> 28:11.795
The DNA profile
came back on the shirt.

28:11.796 --> 28:14.998
It belongs to Maddie Smith,
an unsolved case from last year.

28:14.999 --> 28:17.501
16 year old stabbed repeatedly,

28:17.502 --> 28:19.670
dumped just like Deana.

28:19.671 --> 28:22.673
- Find anything else on Matt?
- It's just more of the same.

28:22.674 --> 28:25.008
Theft, assault, domestic abuse,

28:25.009 --> 28:27.344
- drug-related offences.
- But no murder.

28:27.345 --> 28:29.546
Maybe we just never caught him.

28:29.547 --> 28:31.849
He's been in and out of prison

28:31.850 --> 28:35.319
since he was 18 years old.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.354
When was Maddie Smith's body found?

28:37.355 --> 28:40.357
The night of February 12th.

28:40.358 --> 28:42.359
He was serving

28:42.360 --> 28:44.895
a six-month stint
for breach of probation.

28:44.896 --> 28:47.164
He wasn't released until April 6th.

28:47.165 --> 28:49.833
So unless he was
in two places at once...

28:49.834 --> 28:52.536
Matt Chatland didn't do it.

28:52.537 --> 28:54.538
So what about the plaid shirt?

28:54.539 --> 28:56.607
Wait. I need to look
at that photo album again.

29:03.381 --> 29:05.482
Look at his shirt.

29:07.385 --> 29:09.720
The kid must have grabbed
the keys to the camper

29:09.721 --> 29:12.656
off his dad when he was
passed out on the couch.

29:12.657 --> 29:14.258
What?

29:14.259 --> 29:16.059
- Nothing.
- Don't tell me

29:16.060 --> 29:18.061
- you feel bad for him.
- Of course I don't.

29:18.062 --> 29:20.063
I feel sorry for his mom.
She'll be devastated.

29:20.064 --> 29:22.065
She's the one who raised a psycho.

29:22.066 --> 29:24.334
Sometimes, kids just turn out bad.

29:24.335 --> 29:26.061
Look, if you're about
to have the whole

29:26.062 --> 29:27.804
nature-versus-nurture
argument with me,

29:27.805 --> 29:29.840
I'll tell you right now, it is always

29:29.841 --> 29:31.742
- nurture for me.
- You had a rough upbringing;

29:31.743 --> 29:33.777
- You turned out pretty good.
- Thanks to places like this.

29:33.778 --> 29:36.180
I could leave the crazy at home.

29:36.181 --> 29:39.583
I don't see Cole. Maybe
we should try the next park.

29:39.584 --> 29:42.119
No, his sister said
this is where he goes.

29:45.356 --> 29:48.358
- Want your board back?
- You guys here about Deana?

29:48.359 --> 29:50.527
- You knew her?
- Kinda.

29:50.528 --> 29:54.198
She hung around here. Didn't skate
though, just crush on the guys.

29:54.199 --> 29:57.100
Was Cole Chatland
one of the guys she crushed on?

29:57.101 --> 30:00.003
Chatland? No way, he's weird.

30:00.004 --> 30:02.573
She might have tutored him though.

30:02.574 --> 30:04.374
He's over there
if you want to ask him.

30:04.375 --> 30:08.011
Thanks.

30:08.012 --> 30:10.480
Didn't Deana's dad say
she quit tutoring?

30:10.481 --> 30:12.182
He did.

30:12.183 --> 30:14.685
Maybe Cole didn't take it too well.

30:17.956 --> 30:20.257
Hey, Cole. Remember us?

30:20.258 --> 30:22.059
We need to talk to you about Deana.

30:31.736 --> 30:33.804
Cole.

30:35.707 --> 30:38.976
Before we begin, I need to remind you
you've waived your right to an attorney.

30:38.977 --> 30:40.978
Do you understand what that means?

30:40.979 --> 30:43.080
Pff! I saw how legal aid
helped my dad.

30:43.081 --> 30:46.149
OK.

30:46.150 --> 30:48.585
So let's talk about Deana.

30:48.586 --> 30:50.687
She was your tutor
for a while, wasn't she?

30:50.688 --> 30:53.991
- You like her?
- She was fine.

30:53.992 --> 30:55.926
Fine enough to steal

30:55.927 --> 30:57.928
your dad's keys and take her
to his camper with you?

30:57.929 --> 31:01.999
- But we didn't.
- Yes, you did.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.168
You smoked this joint
together, didn't you?

31:05.169 --> 31:07.170
No, I don't smoke.

31:07.171 --> 31:09.106
But Deana did.

31:09.107 --> 31:11.975
Toxicology found it in her blood
during her autopsy.

31:11.976 --> 31:15.445
She quit being your tutor, why?

31:15.446 --> 31:17.381
I didn't need help anymore.

31:17.382 --> 31:20.017
I've seen your test scores,
man, I beg to differ.

31:20.018 --> 31:21.818
I'm not stupid.

31:21.819 --> 31:24.087
Does it bother you

31:24.088 --> 31:26.423
when people say stuff like that?

31:26.424 --> 31:28.725
Is that why you took her there?

31:28.726 --> 31:31.661
You wanted to show her
how smart you could be?

31:33.598 --> 31:36.833
You know, just because I'm not
from a perfect family

31:36.834 --> 31:38.835
doesn't mean that I killed someone.

31:38.836 --> 31:40.937
That's true,

31:40.938 --> 31:44.107
but the evidence
suggests the contrary.

31:44.108 --> 31:46.576
What evidence?

31:46.577 --> 31:50.280
When can Cole come home?

31:50.281 --> 31:52.482
He's not coming home, Gwen.

31:54.218 --> 31:56.219
We've arrested him for murder.

31:56.220 --> 31:59.056
We have reason to believe,

31:59.057 --> 32:01.258
strong reason,

32:01.259 --> 32:03.894
that he was the one
that killed Deana Williams,

32:03.895 --> 32:05.996
as well as another girl.

32:08.066 --> 32:11.535
No. Matt did.

32:11.536 --> 32:14.738
You said he was the one
that wasn't home that night.

32:14.739 --> 32:18.175
That's right.
He was getting cigarettes.

32:18.176 --> 32:20.977
Cole wasn't home either, was he, Gwen?

32:24.349 --> 32:26.350
You wanna talk about
your family, Cole? Let's talk

32:26.351 --> 32:29.419
about 'em. Can you tell me who
the people in this photo are?

32:29.420 --> 32:31.188
It's me, my sister, my mom.

32:31.189 --> 32:33.023
Do you remember
when the photo was taken?

32:33.024 --> 32:35.459
Christmas, about a year
and a half ago.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.228
Happier times, I take it.

32:38.229 --> 32:40.263
We don't do happy times.

32:40.264 --> 32:43.934
- It's pretty much duck and cover.
- Duck and cover from who?

32:43.935 --> 32:46.470
Depends on the day.

32:46.471 --> 32:49.005
Sometimes Mom.

32:49.006 --> 32:52.075
Mainly Dad though.

32:52.076 --> 32:54.077
I'm very sorry

32:54.078 --> 32:56.880
- you've had to go through that.
- I don't care,

32:56.881 --> 32:58.882
so why should you?

33:01.886 --> 33:04.321
Can you describe to me what
you're wearing in this photo?

33:04.322 --> 33:06.356
Stupid paper hats
that Mom makes us wear

33:06.357 --> 33:08.325
on Christmas Eve.

33:08.326 --> 33:10.727
What else are you wearing?

33:10.728 --> 33:13.497
Brown pants, a shirt.

33:13.498 --> 33:16.566
What does the shirt look like?
Can you describe it to me?

33:16.567 --> 33:19.936
It's blue, plaid.

33:19.937 --> 33:24.307
- Do you still have that shirt?
- No, I think I got rid of it.

33:24.308 --> 33:26.209
- It got ruined.
- How?

33:26.210 --> 33:29.279
I don't remember. I think
it had oil on it or something.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.248
I want to go now.

33:31.249 --> 33:34.351
OK, but first,
can I show you something else?

33:35.920 --> 33:39.055
- What's that?
- Do you recognise it?

33:39.056 --> 33:41.158
- No.
- I think you do.

33:41.159 --> 33:44.461
- No, I don't!
- Really? Because that shirt

33:44.462 --> 33:46.296
looks an awful lot

33:46.297 --> 33:49.032
like the one you were wearing
in the Christmas photo, no?

33:49.033 --> 33:52.169
- No.
- It's not oil, Cole;

33:52.170 --> 33:54.171
That's blood.

33:54.172 --> 33:56.139
It's not Deana's though, is it?

33:56.140 --> 33:59.009
You cleaned up after her,
and fairly well I might add,

33:59.010 --> 34:01.011
but you had practice by then.

34:01.012 --> 34:03.346
Not like when you cleaned up
after Maddie Smith.

34:03.347 --> 34:06.650
- You were still new at this.
- That's not my shirt!

34:06.651 --> 34:08.819
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not!

34:08.820 --> 34:10.821
I know you're not good with
words, Cole, but you're gonna

34:10.822 --> 34:12.956
have to explain to me why we
found this shirt in your back...

34:12.956 --> 34:16.393
Because she told me she got rid of it!

34:26.871 --> 34:29.371
Hall, a word.

34:33.177 --> 34:36.746
What?

34:38.516 --> 34:41.585
Mrs. Chatland,

34:41.585 --> 34:43.687
I'm gonna need you to stand up
and come with me.

34:43.688 --> 34:47.357
Why? What about Cole?

34:47.358 --> 34:50.293
I think you're best to worry
about yourself right now.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.030
Okay. Stevie!

35:04.262 --> 35:06.696
The Chatland's house
has been firebombed.

35:06.697 --> 35:07.430
What?

35:07.431 --> 35:09.599
Yeah, the victim's
brother, Simon Williams,

35:09.600 --> 35:11.668
pitched a pipe bomb
through the living-room window.

35:11.669 --> 35:13.370
- No.
- Kyle had gone to pick him up,

35:13.371 --> 35:15.438
didn't get there in time, and...

35:15.439 --> 35:18.575
and the daughter, Vanessa,
had snuck in to get her iPad.

35:18.576 --> 35:22.245
- Is she alright?
- No, she's in the ICU.

35:22.246 --> 35:24.614
Go talk to the mother.

35:24.615 --> 35:26.349
Yeah.

35:41.198 --> 35:44.434
Who gave you the black eye, Gwen?

35:44.435 --> 35:46.937
Was it Cole?

35:46.938 --> 35:50.306
No. Cole's not like that.
He's a softie.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.411
You got kids, Detective?

35:54.412 --> 35:55.946
Yeah.

35:55.947 --> 35:58.615
I have a son and a daughter.

35:58.616 --> 36:00.650
Just like yourself.

36:00.651 --> 36:03.219
The girls are easy;

36:03.220 --> 36:06.056
It's the boys that are hard.

36:06.057 --> 36:09.426
They'll break your heart.

36:09.427 --> 36:11.461
Still, you gotta do what you can
to protect them.

36:11.462 --> 36:14.998
Were you protecting Cole?

36:14.999 --> 36:17.200
Is that why you hid the clothes
the first time?

36:19.804 --> 36:22.505
Did you understand
that you were hiding evidence

36:22.506 --> 36:24.975
of a murder when you buried
that shirt in the garden?

36:24.976 --> 36:27.811
- That shirt had oil on it.
- No, no, it did not.

36:27.812 --> 36:31.314
It had Maddie Smith's blood
on it. And she'd been

36:31.315 --> 36:33.450
all over the news,
so I know that you saw her.

36:33.451 --> 36:36.486
You don't really think
that Cole did that.

36:36.487 --> 36:39.489
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.858
And you know what?

36:41.859 --> 36:44.027
I think that you do too.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.601
- What's that?
- That is Cole's cellphone.

36:53.504 --> 36:56.706
And it was filled
with pictures of Deana Williams.

36:56.707 --> 36:58.742
Someone erased them
this morning, but our tech

36:58.743 --> 37:02.846
- managed to retrieve them.
- So?

37:02.847 --> 37:04.781
Doesn't prove I knew nothing.

37:04.782 --> 37:08.585
So why was the phone in your
possession when you came in?

37:10.955 --> 37:13.189
Did you ever try and do anything

37:13.190 --> 37:15.725
about Cole's anger problem?

37:15.726 --> 37:17.794
Did you ever try to stop it?

37:19.363 --> 37:22.532
Gwen?

37:22.533 --> 37:25.568
Gwen?

37:25.569 --> 37:28.972
Gwen, look at me.

37:32.043 --> 37:35.211
Deana Williams was somebody's child.

37:35.212 --> 37:38.815
And he's mine.

37:38.816 --> 37:41.251
What was I supposed to do?

37:41.252 --> 37:43.553
He's my baby boy.

37:43.554 --> 37:46.723
I told him

37:46.724 --> 37:48.792
to count to 10.

37:48.793 --> 37:51.261
I told him, "Don't get so worked up."

37:51.262 --> 37:52.996
"Worked up"?

37:54.899 --> 37:58.401
Deana's ribs were shattered.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.670
Her pelvis was broken in two places.

38:00.671 --> 38:02.772
He pulverised her!

38:04.642 --> 38:06.576
It's what his daddy taught him.

38:06.577 --> 38:09.445
Gwen, stop making excuses.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.316
He stabbed those girls

38:13.317 --> 38:15.685
17 times. 17! Do you know

38:15.686 --> 38:18.521
how much anger do you have
to have to do that?!

38:21.425 --> 38:24.093
I'm sorry for what he did
to those girls.

38:26.397 --> 38:28.498
You will be.

38:32.203 --> 38:34.604
Your house was subject
to a pipe-bomb attack,

38:34.605 --> 38:36.606
your daughter was inside at the time.

38:36.607 --> 38:39.809
- Vee?
- Yes. She has been taken by ambulance

38:39.810 --> 38:41.811
- to St. Victoria's.
- No, you're lying.

38:41.812 --> 38:43.913
The 15 year old
responsible for the attack

38:43.914 --> 38:46.583
was the brother of the girl
that your son murdered.

38:46.584 --> 38:49.753
I wanna see my daughter, please.

38:49.754 --> 38:52.455
She's only alive, Gwen, barely alive,

38:52.456 --> 38:54.491
because one of our men
got to her in time.

38:54.492 --> 38:56.726
But no one was there
for Deana, were they?

38:56.727 --> 39:00.630
You let her perish along with any
possibility of justice for Maddie Smith

39:00.631 --> 39:03.266
the moment that you decided
to hide those clothes

39:03.267 --> 39:05.401
and help your son
cover up what he did.

39:08.773 --> 39:11.674
I was just trying to protect him.

39:13.911 --> 39:16.780
I know,

39:16.781 --> 39:19.115
and I understand,

39:19.116 --> 39:21.618
but who's gonna protect
the rest of us?

39:38.402 --> 39:40.770
They call the game Crime Scene.

39:40.771 --> 39:42.739
Nate pretends he's being murdered.

39:42.740 --> 39:45.008
- It's pretty dark.
- It's not that dark.

39:45.009 --> 39:47.010
It is though.

39:47.011 --> 39:50.013
Why don't you tell us
what you think it is, Stevie?

39:50.014 --> 39:54.517
He just doesn't get it.

39:54.518 --> 39:57.554
So, Nate is obsessed
with these detective stories

39:57.555 --> 39:59.522
about this little boy called Mikey

39:59.523 --> 40:01.724
who solves these crimes
with a pet iguana,

40:01.725 --> 40:04.327
and... he's got the bug.

40:04.328 --> 40:06.496
I did too at his age.

40:06.497 --> 40:08.464
So Nate wants to be a detective?

40:08.465 --> 40:11.634
Aw, he would kill at forensics.

40:11.635 --> 40:14.637
Photographic memory,
holding on to all the details,

40:14.638 --> 40:16.906
no interest in the living.

40:19.643 --> 40:22.378
What? It was supposed to be a joke.

40:22.379 --> 40:25.548
Jono mentioned
that your dad's old case

40:25.549 --> 40:27.584
is taking up a lot of your time.

40:27.585 --> 40:31.387
How is that affecting the family?

40:31.388 --> 40:33.556
It's stressful.

40:33.557 --> 40:36.059
She comes home late. She's tense

40:36.060 --> 40:38.161
when she is home. She's not sleeping.

40:38.162 --> 40:40.163
"She" is fine.

40:40.164 --> 40:42.932
And what about the job?
Are you finding it hard?

40:42.933 --> 40:46.703
The job? No. The job is easy.

40:46.704 --> 40:48.905
Dead bodies are cut and dry. You know,

40:48.906 --> 40:51.341
you find the right person,
ask the right questions?

40:51.342 --> 40:53.843
Case closed. It's autism. It's...

40:57.715 --> 40:59.716
Ever since Nate got identified,

40:59.717 --> 41:01.951
we have been on a conveyor belt

41:01.952 --> 41:05.688
of doctors and specialists,

41:05.689 --> 41:07.924
appointments, and...

41:07.925 --> 41:09.859
half the time, I don't even know

41:09.860 --> 41:11.828
what they're saying to me.

41:11.829 --> 41:13.897
Don't even get me started
on the acronyms.

41:13.898 --> 41:16.532
It's like, what? ADD? ASD?

41:16.533 --> 41:18.401
- Possible OCD?
- You're frustrated?

41:18.402 --> 41:20.870
I am pissed off!

41:24.575 --> 41:26.843
And I am exhausted.

41:28.779 --> 41:31.614
And I could really do with a rest.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.950
Yeah, well, so could I, Stevie,
but if I checked out too,

41:33.951 --> 41:36.286
then neither of us will be there.

41:36.287 --> 41:38.254
I didn't mean that how it sounded.

41:38.255 --> 41:40.089
- Yeah.
- OK.

41:41.692 --> 41:44.928
Let's try an exercise. I want
you to maintain eye contact...

41:44.929 --> 41:47.597
and think about a time

41:47.598 --> 41:49.599
when you were there for each other...

41:49.600 --> 41:51.734
when you felt supported.

41:53.637 --> 41:57.140
Come on. Let's just try this.

41:57.141 --> 41:59.142
Come on.

42:11.822 --> 42:13.823
No.

42:13.824 --> 42:17.293
Daddy, no!

42:22.533 --> 42:24.667
No! NOOO!

42:24.668 --> 42:26.769
NOOO! No!

42:29.506 --> 42:32.942
Now tell me, Stevie,
what do you see?
