00:03.635 --> 00:06.214
Hi, Charlie. It's your big
sister Teddy with my video diary.

00:06.248 --> 00:09.986
So today, I want to talk
to you about best friends.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.626
You bragging
about me again?

00:11.661 --> 00:14.231
Huh. Yeah, this is Ivy.
She's my BFF.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.133
I'm also her hero,

00:16.167 --> 00:18.402
the wind beneath her wings,
the hip in her hop,

00:18.437 --> 00:20.070
the peanut to her butter.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.671
- I am... - The mouth
that wouldn't shut.

00:22.705 --> 00:25.039
Let's see how
we're looking.

00:25.073 --> 00:27.639
Perfect!

00:27.673 --> 00:29.539
- I'd date us.
- I'd marry us.

00:32.174 --> 00:35.813
- So what's the big news? - You are
not gonna believe what I did for you.

00:35.847 --> 00:39.051
I saw the cutest guy working
at the mall food court...

00:39.085 --> 00:42.053
And pause
for dramatic effect...

00:42.087 --> 00:44.419
Tomorrow I'm going
to talk to him.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.923
How is this something
you're doing for me?

00:46.957 --> 00:50.327
Maybe he has a friend. The
cute ones always have a friend.

00:50.361 --> 00:52.229
I mean, I have you, right?

00:54.366 --> 00:56.602
Hi, girls.
What you doing?

00:56.636 --> 00:58.836
Nothin'.

00:58.870 --> 01:00.872
- How's it going, Ivy?
- Real good.

01:00.906 --> 01:02.775
Ignore her. She'll go away.

01:04.212 --> 01:06.513
You girls are always
on those phones.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.515
- Who are you texting now?
- Nobody.

01:08.549 --> 01:11.918
- Clueless!
- I wish I could do that.

01:11.952 --> 01:14.687
Hey, then you and I could text
each other. Wouldn't that be fun?

01:14.722 --> 01:18.625
Oh my gosh, mom,
I'd love that!

01:20.494 --> 01:23.295
- I don't think I can text
from this phone. - Oh, well!

01:23.330 --> 01:25.565
Sure you can, miss d.
What's your number?

01:25.599 --> 01:28.368
555-0134.

01:28.402 --> 01:30.470
Not ignoring.

01:30.504 --> 01:32.771
What is that noise?

01:32.806 --> 01:34.606
I just sent you a text.

01:34.641 --> 01:36.442
Just hit that button to read it.

01:36.476 --> 01:38.276
Well, look at that.

01:38.311 --> 01:40.979
Oh, that's funny, Ivy.

01:41.013 --> 01:43.247
Then your response
is "L.O.L."

01:43.282 --> 01:46.449
"Laugh out loud."

01:46.484 --> 01:49.685
No... no, mom. You don't
do it, you type it.

01:51.021 --> 01:52.789
Or if you want
to get a little saucy,

01:52.823 --> 01:54.491
You can wink.

01:54.525 --> 01:59.328
Not there. There.

01:59.362 --> 02:02.430
Just a semicolon
and parentheses.

02:02.465 --> 02:05.133
Oh, that does
look like a wink.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.468
I can't believe
I'm finally a texter.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.503
Let's see if it works
from the kitchen!

02:14.843 --> 02:19.280
- "W.H.Y.D."?
- What have you done?

03:23.407 --> 03:26.108
Yeah, this is way more fun
since you've learned how to clap.

03:26.143 --> 03:28.343
<i>Don't ignore me!</i>

03:28.378 --> 03:30.646
<i>When I tell you to do
something, I expect you to do it!</i>

03:30.680 --> 03:32.614
<i>Get off my back, woman!</i>

03:32.648 --> 03:34.282
<i>You want me off your back?</i>

03:34.317 --> 03:37.385
<i>I can arrange that.</i>

03:37.419 --> 03:39.787
Charlie, those are
our neighbors, the Dabneys.

03:39.821 --> 03:43.123
They've been married
a long time.

03:43.158 --> 03:46.526
Hey, P.J., I just kicked the football

03:46.561 --> 03:48.862
Into the Dabneys' backyard.
Will you go get it?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.665
No way! They're going at it again.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.367
- Well, what about the football?
- Who cares?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.369
It's gone.
Kiss it goodbye.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.637
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that

03:58.671 --> 04:00.404
Because it was
your football.

04:16.785 --> 04:18.486
<i>Ha! I warned you!</i>

04:18.519 --> 04:21.553
<i>That's what you get
for being a bad husband!</i>

04:21.589 --> 04:24.424
<i>And now you're dead!</i>

04:29.196 --> 04:31.063
Is somebody out here?

04:31.097 --> 04:33.632
Who's out here?

04:58.387 --> 05:01.521
- Where's the football?
- Forget the football!

05:01.556 --> 05:03.923
Mrs. Dabney just
murdered Mr. Dabney!

05:04.925 --> 05:06.859
What?!

05:06.893 --> 05:08.860
I heard her talking
to his corpse.

05:08.895 --> 05:10.962
It was chilling.

05:10.996 --> 05:13.231
Just so I'm clear,

05:13.265 --> 05:15.366
You didn't get
the football?

05:15.400 --> 05:18.302
- I'm serious, Gabe.
- Come on!

05:18.337 --> 05:21.105
Mrs. Dabney may be
a mean, vicious, cruel,

05:21.140 --> 05:24.275
Horrible,
nasty old witch,

05:24.310 --> 05:26.544
But she'd never
do something like that.

05:26.578 --> 05:28.146
- You don't believe me?
- No.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.215
Fine. Fine, I'll prove it.

05:30.249 --> 05:32.651
Come here, Gabe.

05:32.685 --> 05:35.153
<i>Hello?</i>

05:35.187 --> 05:39.257
Is Mr. Dabney home?

05:39.291 --> 05:41.758
<i>He... can't come to the phone.</i>

05:41.793 --> 05:45.060
Interesting.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.095
<i>Who is this?</i>

05:47.129 --> 05:51.363
Uh... I'm some
sort of salesman.

05:53.332 --> 05:55.232
<i>Gabe, is that you?</i>

05:55.267 --> 05:58.002
Why would you assume
my name is Gabe?

05:59.104 --> 06:01.271
<i>Because I have caller ID.</i>

06:03.608 --> 06:06.576
Oh! Then yeah, it's Gabe.

06:06.611 --> 06:08.744
Hey!

06:08.779 --> 06:11.747
Whoo! She's cool under
pressure, I'll give her that.

06:11.782 --> 06:14.916
- P.J., she's not a murderer.
- I heard what I heard, Gabe.

06:14.951 --> 06:16.517
Why don't you believe me?

06:16.552 --> 06:19.553
Because you're you
and you get things wrong.

06:21.489 --> 06:23.823
What are you saying,
that I'm dumb?

06:25.292 --> 06:27.092
Well, no.

06:27.127 --> 06:29.227
You're just not very...

06:31.029 --> 06:34.530
- Thinky.
- Thinky?

06:34.565 --> 06:36.866
Gabe, why would you
say something like that?

06:36.900 --> 06:39.034
'Cause mom said
I can't call you dumb.

06:40.970 --> 06:42.804
It is so pathetic.

06:42.838 --> 06:44.839
My mom's in the kitchen
texting away.

06:44.873 --> 06:46.841
Gosh, I'd hate to be on the
other end of that conversation.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.778
Who are you texting?

06:49.812 --> 06:52.379
- Your mom.
- I am so sorry.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.347
Look, I promise I'll
get her out of your hair.

06:54.382 --> 06:56.348
No, it's okay.
Your mom's cool.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.017
My mom is what?

06:59.051 --> 07:00.652
And she's really funny.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.187
My mom is what?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.323
Wait, that's her again.

07:05.357 --> 07:07.658
What are you talking about with my mom?

07:07.692 --> 07:09.326
- Nothing.
- Nothing?!

07:09.361 --> 07:11.062
That's what say to her!

07:11.096 --> 07:14.065
Hold on,
I have to "L.O.L." Her.

07:16.568 --> 07:18.869
Okay, well "L.O.L." Has
officially lost all meaning.

07:21.005 --> 07:24.240
I'm sorry.
Is this a problem for you?

07:24.275 --> 07:26.909
No, I just think it's
a little bit inappropriate.

07:26.944 --> 07:29.545
Inappropriate? Now you
sound like my mother.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.081
Well, how would you know
what your mother sounds like?

07:33.115 --> 07:35.850
You've been spending
so much time with mine!

07:35.884 --> 07:37.886
What are you getting
so whacked about?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.854
You didn't
want to text her.

07:39.889 --> 07:42.690
Well yeah, that's because
she's my mom, not my friend.

07:42.724 --> 07:45.358
- Wouldn't you be weirded out if
I was texting your mom? - Yes...

07:45.393 --> 07:48.327
Because she doesn't
have a cell phone.

07:48.361 --> 07:50.895
Look, t, if you're
not cool with this,

07:50.929 --> 07:52.896
I'll just stop.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.931
No no, I don't care.
I mean, it's a free country.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.532
Go crazy...
text my mom,

07:56.567 --> 07:58.534
I.M. My dad,
video-Chat my aunt helen.

07:58.568 --> 08:00.602
Oh! Your aunt helen?

08:00.637 --> 08:02.704
Your mom says she is
da bomb diggitty!

08:04.407 --> 08:06.708
My mom really said
"da bomb diggitty"?

08:06.742 --> 08:09.409
Well, I y have
added that part.

08:16.049 --> 08:18.582
P.J. You've got to stop
watching these mysteries.

08:18.617 --> 08:21.453
Not until I figure out
how to catch Mrs. Dabney.

08:21.487 --> 08:23.288
These old movies
are gonna help me do that.

08:23.322 --> 08:25.756
That's like saying
cartoons will teach you

08:25.791 --> 08:27.591
How to run through walls.

08:27.626 --> 08:30.561
Learned that the hard way.

08:30.595 --> 08:34.530
Mom! Can you get that?!

08:34.565 --> 08:38.234
Sure, I'll get the door.
I am a lot closer to it.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.738
Hello, Mrs. Dabney.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.374
- Hello.
- Come on in.

08:45.408 --> 08:47.575
Heads up!
Killer in the house.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.045
What have they
done this time?

08:51.079 --> 08:53.747
For once, nothing...
that I know of.

08:53.782 --> 08:56.650
It's nice to see you too.

08:58.252 --> 09:00.320
I'd like to speak
with your husband, please.

09:00.354 --> 09:05.591
I'll let him know
you're here.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.492
I'm a texter now.

09:09.462 --> 09:11.595
I'm texting.

09:13.364 --> 09:15.264
Really speeds things up.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.400
Somebody lose a ball today?

09:19.435 --> 09:23.370
Possibly. Did you lose
anything today, Mrs. Dabney?

09:25.706 --> 09:29.240
Honey, what does this mean:
"somebody's at the doof."

09:32.043 --> 09:34.043
O.M.G.!

09:36.546 --> 09:39.747
I meant "door"!

09:39.782 --> 09:41.517
T.T.Y.L.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.955
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Dabney?

09:45.990 --> 09:49.861
- You're an exterminator, righ
- Pest control specialist.

09:49.895 --> 09:53.364
Maybe you can help me
with a problem I'm having.

09:53.398 --> 09:55.932
How do I get the smell
of death out of my house?

09:59.903 --> 10:02.438
Will you turn
that tv down?

10:02.472 --> 10:05.708
- So youhink something died in your house?
- Oh, I know something's dead.

10:05.742 --> 10:08.043
Well, first thing
you're gonna have to do

10:08.077 --> 10:09.878
Is locate and dispose
of the carcass.

10:09.912 --> 10:11.813
I suppose you could get
Mr. Dabney to do that.

10:11.847 --> 10:14.348
Oh, Mr. Dabney won't
be doing anything

10:14.382 --> 10:16.349
Around the house
for a while...

10:16.384 --> 10:18.451
A long while.
He's... gone.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.756
You know what,
would you just turn it off?

10:26.192 --> 10:28.292
What's wrong
with your boys today?

10:28.327 --> 10:30.661
I just got here.

10:30.695 --> 10:32.496
Um, all right,
old trick of the trade...

10:32.530 --> 10:34.464
Get yourself some maple
syrup, put it on the stove,

10:34.499 --> 10:37.634
Let it simmer... that
should get rid of the smell.

10:37.668 --> 10:41.537
Thank you. That
very useful information.

10:41.571 --> 10:44.073
Bye, boys.

10:49.379 --> 10:51.546
"I.T.B.O.O.T.P."...

10:51.580 --> 10:54.248
What does that stand for?

10:54.283 --> 10:57.518
<i>In the bathroom
out of toilet paper!</i>

10:59.387 --> 11:02.322
T.M.I.!

11:02.356 --> 11:04.824
I can't believe it,
but you were right!

11:04.858 --> 11:06.492
Mrs. Dabney did it.

11:06.526 --> 11:09.594
Wow! This is what it feels
like to be right, huh?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.763
I like it!

11:12.798 --> 11:14.564
Too bad somebody
had to die, but...

11:14.599 --> 11:16.733
- What are we gonna do now?
- I have to tell mom and dad!

11:16.767 --> 11:18.501
They're never
gonna believe you.

11:18.535 --> 11:20.136
I didn't believe you
and I'm 10.

11:21.371 --> 11:23.171
Well, then we need proof.

11:23.206 --> 11:25.373
And I have to warn you, Gabe,
until we get that proof,

11:25.407 --> 11:26.941
Our lives may be in danger.

11:30.578 --> 11:33.714
I thought we turned that off.

11:43.228 --> 11:45.230
What'd you get
for number nine?

11:45.264 --> 11:47.699
Switzerland.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.735
Well, that's odd
since we're doing math.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.374
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:56.408 --> 11:58.376
Mom, what are you
doing here?

11:58.410 --> 12:00.311
You weren't supposed
to pick me up until 5:00.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.313
Teddy left a message
and said to come by early...

12:02.347 --> 12:04.348
Something about "chilling"?

12:05.782 --> 12:07.483
Yeah, that's right.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.417
Thought your mom and I
could chill for a little while.

12:09.451 --> 12:11.685
Really? This is
what you're doing?

12:11.719 --> 12:13.352
Yeah well, this is
what we're doing,

12:13.387 --> 12:15.420
So if you
will excuse us,

12:15.455 --> 12:18.156
- We'd like a little privacy please.
- Sure. Fine.

12:18.190 --> 12:21.058
I'll be in the kitchen
with your mom.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.768
Come on over.

12:33.802 --> 12:36.270
Sit down next to me,
girlfriend.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.538
What's this all about?
Is Ivy in trouble?

12:39.573 --> 12:41.239
Oh, no!

12:41.274 --> 12:43.274
Is she back
on the chocolate?

12:45.077 --> 12:46.744
No no no, Ivy's fine.

12:46.778 --> 12:48.412
I just wanted
to spend some time

12:48.446 --> 12:50.614
With one of the cool moms.

12:51.615 --> 12:54.550
You.

12:54.584 --> 12:56.218
Okay.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.458
I love your outfit.
Where'd you get it?

13:03.492 --> 13:05.126
My closet.

13:09.798 --> 13:12.299
You are so funny. I bet
you get that a lot, right?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.234
- No.
- No?

13:15.269 --> 13:18.303
Are we done chilling?

13:18.338 --> 13:23.207
Yes. Yes, we are because it is time
to Par-Tay. Let's get this jam started!

13:25.176 --> 13:28.612
Yeah! Come on, Miss W!
Let your freak flag fly!

13:30.747 --> 13:33.983
That's kind of loud.
Could you lower that, please?

13:34.017 --> 13:36.819
Yeah.

13:36.853 --> 13:38.621
A little bit more.

13:40.323 --> 13:42.223
A little bit more.

13:42.258 --> 13:44.792
Perfect.

13:44.827 --> 13:46.194
Hey, want to do
something fun?

13:46.228 --> 13:48.529
I like making these video
diars for my baby sister.

13:48.564 --> 13:50.831
So how about we say hi?

13:50.865 --> 13:52.799
Hi, Charlie.
It's Teddy here

13:52.834 --> 13:55.501
With my new friend
Mrs. Wentz.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.237
Hello.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.305
Let's see how we look.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.674
Oh, I'd date us.
Wouldn't you?

14:02.708 --> 14:05.543
I'm married.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.812
Okay, that's enough of that.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.149
No, you know what? We've been
doing a lot of my fun stuff.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.251
Tell me... tell me about you.
What do you like to do for fun?

14:12.285 --> 14:15.521
I like to knit.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.454
That is so cool because...
anything else?

14:21.456 --> 14:23.590
- I like to read.
- Oh, yeah? Me too.

14:23.624 --> 14:25.858
- What kind of stuff do you like
to read? - Knitting magazines.

14:28.095 --> 14:30.429
That's awesome. I mean,
weave so much in common...

14:30.464 --> 14:34.066
You know, once I start
reading knitting magazines,

14:34.100 --> 14:36.101
Which you're pulling
out of your bag.

14:44.475 --> 14:46.109
Okay, she's gone.

14:46.143 --> 14:47.943
Here's how this
is gonna go dodown.

14:47.978 --> 14:50.546
I'm gonna jump over the fence,
you hand Charlie to me.

14:50.580 --> 14:53.148
- And then... - Or I could
just walk through the gate

14:53.183 --> 14:55.217
Like this.

14:55.251 --> 14:57.953
You did know there
was a gate, right?

14:57.988 --> 15:02.190
Yes. Would I be riding
on top of it if I didn't?

15:05.494 --> 15:08.229
- Now what?
- Now it's time to be

15:08.263 --> 15:10.731
In operation
"catch a killer"...

15:10.766 --> 15:12.699
While babysitting.

15:14.769 --> 15:16.737
So, what are we looking for?

15:16.771 --> 15:19.606
Evidence, clues, a weapon.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.941
Mr. Dabney's rotting corpse
would be nice.

15:22.975 --> 15:24.609
Oh my gosh,
that's horrible!

15:24.643 --> 15:27.776
- What? What do you see?
- That paint color...

15:27.811 --> 15:29.444
It's so wrong
for that room!

15:31.879 --> 15:35.148
- I watch a lot of design shows.
- Focus!

15:37.219 --> 15:40.321
- Look. Something's moving.
- Where?

15:40.355 --> 15:42.355
By the couch,
right... right there.

15:42.389 --> 15:44.657
- It's a baby!
- It's Charlie!

15:44.691 --> 15:47.325
No, it's not.
Charlie's right over...

15:47.359 --> 15:49.993
Inside the murder house!

15:54.630 --> 15:56.797
Okay, try to stay
with me now

15:56.832 --> 15:59.165
Because we're going
to get a little wild.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.635
Instead of knit one,
purl two,

16:02.670 --> 16:05.939
We kick it up
to knit one, purl three!

16:05.974 --> 16:08.710
Is that even legal?

16:08.744 --> 16:10.545
I don't know,

16:10.579 --> 16:13.148
But I just like
living dangerously!

16:13.182 --> 16:16.317
Okay, I'm gonna go
get something to drink.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.952
- Do you want anything?
- Oh, not now.

16:17.986 --> 16:19.587
I'm in the zone!

16:23.224 --> 16:25.025
What you doing in here?

16:25.060 --> 16:27.561
Giving up.

16:27.595 --> 16:31.463
Did she suck
the life out of you?

16:31.498 --> 16:33.299
Yeah, pretty much.

16:33.333 --> 16:36.068
Now you see why
I'm always at your house.

16:36.102 --> 16:37.836
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.504
I was being selfish
with my mom.

16:39.539 --> 16:41.506
And even though I think
it's a little bit weird,

16:41.541 --> 16:43.041
You can xt her
as much as you want.

16:43.075 --> 16:45.777
I think I got
a better idea.

16:46.778 --> 16:48.379
And then, get this,

16:48.413 --> 16:50.715
If you type in
a semicolon parentheses,

16:50.749 --> 16:53.017
- You get a...
- Winky face!

16:54.853 --> 16:57.055
I have got to get
a cell phone.

16:58.757 --> 17:00.925
I like it.
You put our moms together

17:00.960 --> 17:03.094
And they leave us alone.
You are brilliant.

17:03.128 --> 17:05.063
See, this is why
we're B.F.F.S.

17:05.097 --> 17:08.098
I'm brilliant
and you recognize it.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.568
Now if I type "R.O.T.F."

17:10.603 --> 17:13.771
Do I actually
have to roll on the floor?

17:13.805 --> 17:16.839
I thought the same
thing at first,

17:16.874 --> 17:18.941
But no.

17:18.974 --> 17:20.540
This'll get her out.

17:20.575 --> 17:23.175
Charlie loves
things that rattle.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.611
Okay, girl.
Charlie, come on.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.246
Get the keys.
Get the keys!

17:27.280 --> 17:29.514
Aw, man!
I dropped the keys.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.715
Fantastic!

17:31.749 --> 17:33.416
Now we can't get
into our house either.

17:36.151 --> 17:38.986
- I don't see Charlie. Where'd she go?
- Oh, there she is.

17:44.391 --> 17:47.023
Wait, what is she
putting on her head,

17:47.058 --> 17:49.025
A dishtowel?

17:49.059 --> 17:51.694
Mrs. Dabney's underpants!

17:53.598 --> 17:55.699
Man!

17:55.733 --> 17:57.366
Come on, we gotta
get her out of there.

17:57.401 --> 17:59.101
Yeah, come on!

17:59.135 --> 18:02.203
What are you doing
in my yard?

18:02.237 --> 18:05.071
We're here to help you
with your groceries.

18:05.106 --> 18:06.572
You want to be helpful?

18:06.607 --> 18:10.072
I like to try new things.

18:10.107 --> 18:11.740
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.708
I can handle
the grocies.

18:13.743 --> 18:15.811
But as long
as you're here,

18:15.845 --> 18:17.747
I could use yourelp
with something inside.

18:17.781 --> 18:20.550
Inside? Perfect.

18:20.584 --> 18:23.552
Let me just put
my groceries down.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.754
- Take your time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:25.789 --> 18:27.622
Where's Charlie?

18:27.656 --> 18:30.992
- Look behind the curtains!
- Okay.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.094
- Nothing!
- There she is!

18:33.128 --> 18:35.162
Oh, I've got you.

18:39.501 --> 18:41.769
I don't want it!

18:44.172 --> 18:46.239
Where did that
baby come from?

18:46.273 --> 18:48.006
Charlie? I've been
holding her the whole time.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.675
- You have?
- That's sad, Mrs. Dabney.

18:50.709 --> 18:53.142
They say the eyes are
the first things to go.

18:53.176 --> 18:54.643
We gotta go.

18:54.677 --> 18:56.511
Not so fast.
Put the baby down.

18:56.545 --> 18:58.779
I need you to carry
something out for me.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.151
I want you to take
this trunk out to my car.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.785
It's too heavy for me.

19:05.819 --> 19:08.187
- Why? What's in it?
- Something I should've

19:08.221 --> 19:10.122
Gotten rid of
a long time ago.

19:11.658 --> 19:13.290
- Where are you taking it?
- To the dump.

19:13.325 --> 19:15.024
That's where you
take trash, isn't it?

19:15.058 --> 19:16.758
Trash?!

19:16.793 --> 19:19.260
Mr. Dabney wasn't trash,
he was a person!

19:19.295 --> 19:22.964
- What are you talking about? - You
know exactly what I'm talking about.

19:22.998 --> 19:25.500
You bumped off your husband
and stuffed him into that trunk.

19:25.534 --> 19:28.170
- Is that what you think?!
- That's what we know!

19:30.339 --> 19:32.607
What is she...
oh, watch it!

19:32.642 --> 19:34.709
She's kill-Crazy!

19:34.744 --> 19:36.878
You want to see
what's in here?

19:36.912 --> 19:38.646
Take a look.

19:43.419 --> 19:45.718
It's Mr. Dabney!

19:45.753 --> 19:48.121
And he's already decomposed!

19:48.155 --> 19:49.889
That's not Mr. Dabney.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.990
That's a skeleton
he used in his classroom.

19:52.025 --> 19:55.026
He used to be
a science teacher.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.796
But I heard you
screaming at him.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.064
You called him a bad husband
and then you said,

20:00.099 --> 20:02.166
"And now you're dead!"

20:02.200 --> 20:04.968
Oh! You must have
heard me talking back

20:05.003 --> 20:06.570
To someone on my soaps.

20:06.604 --> 20:07.971
Soaps?

20:08.005 --> 20:10.806
Soap operas...
on tv...

20:10.840 --> 20:12.808
Like the one they should
name after you two...

20:12.842 --> 20:14.542
"The young and the clueless."

20:16.111 --> 20:18.346
Well, if Mr. Dabney isn't
dead, then where is he?

20:18.380 --> 20:20.881
At his mother's probably
wishing he was dead.

20:23.051 --> 20:25.686
Well, then how do you
explain the smell of death

20:25.720 --> 20:28.421
- You asked my dad about?
- Dead possum in my dryer vent.

20:28.456 --> 20:31.824
Well, then how
do you explain...

20:31.859 --> 20:33.559
That's pretty much it,
I guess.

20:35.261 --> 20:37.395
Just one more question...

20:37.430 --> 20:39.564
Do you have any cookies?

20:40.866 --> 20:42.900
Get out.

20:46.705 --> 20:49.072
What are my underpants
doing in the fireplace?

20:49.106 --> 20:51.107
Gotta go!

20:57.544 --> 20:59.711
Here she comes!

20:59.745 --> 21:02.846
Coolest mom
in the world!

21:02.881 --> 21:04.448
Okay, what's all this?

21:04.482 --> 21:06.383
Oh, just showing Charlie
how much I love you.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.083
Oh, I love you too, sweetie.

21:08.118 --> 21:10.218
And I love you too, Charlie.

21:10.253 --> 21:12.520
Oh, so mom,
I've been thinking...

21:12.555 --> 21:14.555
Maybe you and I
should start texting.

21:14.590 --> 21:16.291
I mean, you are
a pretty cool mom, right?

21:16.326 --> 21:18.628
Oh, sorry, honey.
Those days are over.

21:19.897 --> 21:21.898
Text thumbs.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.534
Text thumbs?
That's our mom...

21:25.568 --> 21:28.637
From cool to embarrassing
just like that.

21:28.671 --> 21:30.506
All right.
Good luck, Charlie.

21:38.332 --> 21:41.433
Hey, guys. Better make
your friend a sandwich.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.202
He's looking
a little thin.

21:44.236 --> 21:45.769
Where'd you guys
get that thing?

21:45.804 --> 21:47.938
Mrs. Dabney
was throwing it out.

21:47.972 --> 21:50.608
Yeah, it belonged to Mr. Dabney.
He was a science teacher.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.811
Mr. Dabney wasn't a science
teacher. He was a music teacher.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.646
What?!

21:55.681 --> 21:58.282
- That means...
- This is...

22:04.823 --> 22:06.790
Mr. Dabney wasn't
a music teacher.

22:06.825 --> 22:10.794
You're thinking of...
of Mr. Dixon across the street.

22:10.828 --> 22:13.596
Oh, that's right. Mr. Dabney
was a science teacher.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.801
The boys seem
a little jumpy to you?

22:18.836 --> 22:20.469
Ah, I just got here.
