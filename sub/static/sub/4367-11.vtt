00:01.718 --> 00:03.886
You are being watched.

00:03.888 --> 00:06.406
The government
has a secret system...

00:06.408 --> 00:11.093
A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.429
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.431 --> 00:14.781
but it sees everything...

00:14.783 --> 00:18.534
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.536 --> 00:21.320
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.539
We don't.

00:23.541 --> 00:27.960
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.862
You will never find us.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.448
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.450 --> 00:35.656
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:35.657 --> 00:38.463

00:39.590 --> 00:41.474
911. What is your emergency?

00:41.476 --> 00:44.393
This is
subway train operator 4827.

00:44.395 --> 00:45.761
There's been an accident.

00:45.763 --> 00:47.413
I couldn't stop the train
in time,

00:47.415 --> 00:48.797
and I hit a kid.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.268
I think
he might have been pushed.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.691
Open.

Advertise your product or brand here

01:17.044 --> 01:18.794
I want 'em held in isolation.

01:18.796 --> 01:20.596
Not with their lawyers,

01:20.598 --> 01:22.882
not with each other,
not with anybody.

01:22.884 --> 01:25.501
This is a matter
of national security.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.969
They're terrorists?

01:26.971 --> 01:29.838
They look more like
investment bankers to me.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.475
Well, warden,
three of them may be.

01:32.477 --> 01:34.560
But one of them is
the most dangerous criminal

01:34.562 --> 01:36.279
I've ever pursued.

01:36.281 --> 01:38.447
I can hold them for 72 hours
without charging them,

01:38.449 --> 01:40.783
and I fully intend to.

01:40.785 --> 01:42.785
Then you have 72 hours.

01:42.787 --> 01:46.205
This is Rikers, not Guantanamo.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.043
You don't plan on asking them
any questions?

01:51.045 --> 01:52.628
Don't worry, Carter.

01:52.630 --> 01:54.163
We've got the DNA evidence
from new Rochelle,

01:54.165 --> 01:56.299
we got the blood
from the burned car,

01:56.301 --> 01:59.085
and, thanks to you,
fingerprints.

01:59.087 --> 02:04.507
He's ours.

02:35.839 --> 02:37.373
How did I know

02:37.375 --> 02:39.125
the federal government would be
no match for you?

02:39.127 --> 02:40.710
As I suspect
it might be compromising for you

02:40.712 --> 02:42.295
to be found with a phone,
I'll be brief.

02:42.297 --> 02:43.746
The matter is in hand, John.

02:43.748 --> 02:45.047
We'll get you out of there.

02:45.049 --> 02:46.382
I took too many risks.

02:46.384 --> 02:47.934
It's my fault.
I'll handle it.

02:47.936 --> 02:49.385
Listen to me.

02:49.387 --> 02:50.937
I made preparations
for a scenario like this.

02:50.939 --> 02:53.255
In 72 hours,
you will walk free.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.090
What if
another number comes up?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.276
Unfortunately,
as I told you,

02:57.278 --> 02:59.061
they never stop coming.

02:59.063 --> 03:01.364
I'll have
to manage as best I can.

03:01.366 --> 03:02.448
I sincerely hope
our next conversation is

03:02.450 --> 03:05.434
under better circumstances.

03:07.538 --> 03:12.124
I'll be in touch.

03:12.126 --> 03:16.379
My name is Mr. Swift.

03:16.381 --> 03:19.465
I'm your substitute teacher.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.951
Ms. Benthem received
a last-minute opportunity

03:22.953 --> 03:26.138
to attend an all-expenses-paid
teaching seminar in Maui.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.808
I see
in Ms. Benthem's lesson plan

03:28.810 --> 03:32.127
that today we're doing...
Addition.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.462
That can't be right.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.814
It's busywork, punishment.

03:34.816 --> 03:35.964
We're supposed
to add all the numbers

03:35.966 --> 03:40.569
from one to a hundred.

03:40.571 --> 03:43.138
You know,
in the late 18th century,

03:43.140 --> 03:46.575
there was a math prodigy
named Carl Friedrich Gauss

03:46.577 --> 03:49.362
who was faced
with the same tedious problem

03:49.364 --> 03:50.979
that you are.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.315
He figured a way around it.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.201
One to a hundred.

03:55.203 --> 03:58.621
Who'd like to take a crack
at working out Gauss' equation?

03:58.623 --> 04:00.706
Anybody?

04:00.708 --> 04:03.876
Mr. Phipps?

04:03.878 --> 04:06.095
Uh...

04:06.097 --> 04:09.882
I got to be honest, "Mr. Swifty,"
you lost me at "Friedrich."

04:11.135 --> 04:14.637
I'll give you a hint.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.696
- Fusco.
- Good morning, Detective.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.381
I trust
that you received my email?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.500
And the entire roll call
for Brooklyn science.

04:44.502 --> 04:46.585
I need you
to tell me everything you can

04:46.587 --> 04:49.588
about Caleb Phipps.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.474
Couple run-ins with the NYPD.

04:51.476 --> 04:53.375
Typical kid stuff.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.478
- Nothing exceptional.
- I'll say.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.012
2.6 gpa

04:57.014 --> 05:01.550
and test scores that
sit squarely in the mid-range.

05:01.552 --> 05:05.821
He spent my whole class doodling
in his notebook.

05:09.326 --> 05:10.659
Hey, you still there?

05:10.661 --> 05:11.861
Please continue.

05:11.863 --> 05:13.446
One thing did come up.

05:13.448 --> 05:14.830
Caleb had an older brother Ryan,

05:14.832 --> 05:16.999
killed two years ago
in a subway accident.

05:17.001 --> 05:18.250
Kid was drunk.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.835
Slipped on the tracks
and got clipped.

05:19.837 --> 05:21.170
Sounds awful.

05:21.172 --> 05:22.705
Any further details?

05:22.707 --> 05:24.206
I'll pull the incident report.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.958
Now Caleb lives alone
with his mom.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.844
She's an administrative
assistant in Kensington.

05:28.846 --> 05:31.130
Hey, Caleb.

05:31.132 --> 05:32.798
You going
to that party saturday?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.967
Uh, no, that's
not my kind of thing.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.418
Oh.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.803
Besides,
I'm heading out of town.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.472
Taking a trip.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.544
They never seem
to stop texting.

06:01.546 --> 06:03.162
Beginning to feel like
I'm on another planet.

06:03.164 --> 06:04.964
Get used to it.

06:04.966 --> 06:07.333
Their planet's gonna be running
ours in about ten years.

06:07.335 --> 06:09.084
High schools
are different nowadays.

06:09.086 --> 06:11.119
Gang fights, drug searches,
and pregnancies.

06:11.121 --> 06:15.090
This kid could be
into anything.

06:16.778 --> 06:19.745
You weren't exaggerating
about the drug problem.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.130
Kids ain't
what they used to be.

06:21.132 --> 06:22.648
Be careful in there, pal.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.657
I-I won't even ask.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.076
Probably best.

06:34.078 --> 06:37.663
Besides, we have
more urgent matters to discuss.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.449
Our friend in Rikers.

06:40.451 --> 06:42.317
I have the situation in hand.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.337
I don't want you crossing
some kind of line to do...

06:45.339 --> 06:46.922
This?

06:46.924 --> 06:50.960
Already deleted them
from the network too.

06:50.962 --> 06:52.761
That line
you're talking about,

06:52.763 --> 06:54.680
I crossed it a long time ago.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.432
Now we have
to deal with the DNA sample.

06:56.434 --> 07:00.219
FBI keeps it in a secure lab
here in New York.

07:00.221 --> 07:01.770
I know what to do.

07:01.772 --> 07:05.891
But I'm gonna need
a couple things from you.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.927
This is principal Lawton,

07:06.928 --> 07:08.611
reminding you

07:08.613 --> 07:10.178
that the Brooklyn school
of science & humanities

07:10.180 --> 07:11.847
closes promptly at 5:00 P.M.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.649
Thank you.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.405
Mr. Swift.

07:19.407 --> 07:23.692
A word, please.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.377
It has come to my attention

07:25.379 --> 07:27.246
that you tried
to show Ms. Benthem's students

07:27.248 --> 07:29.715
how to get around
one of her assignments.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.884
Well, the assignment
seemed a bit remedial.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.870
- I was hoping to teach...
- Teaching is Ms. Benthem's job.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.205
Your job is to ensure
that her students

07:37.207 --> 07:40.226
do the work
that she prepared.

07:46.433 --> 07:49.051
Don't sweat Lawton.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.569
She thinks schools
would run better

07:50.571 --> 07:53.055
if they just got rid
of the students and teachers.

07:53.057 --> 07:55.941
Chris Beckner,
computer science.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.526
Harold Swift.

07:57.528 --> 07:59.912
- Nice to meet an idealist.
- No, no, not me.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.497
Throw all this stuff online,
I say.

08:01.499 --> 08:04.667
Let me teach in my boxers.

08:04.669 --> 08:06.619
Run wild, man.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.259
I believe I will.

08:21.487 --> 08:22.987
Yes, Detective Fusco?

08:22.989 --> 08:24.772
Do you have some
new information for me?

08:24.774 --> 08:26.691
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I do.

08:26.693 --> 08:28.659
I took a look at the report
of his brother's death.

08:28.661 --> 08:31.946
- Caleb was the only witness.
- He was there?

08:31.948 --> 08:33.998
His brother died
right in front of him?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.482
Yeah, but something's
not right.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.484
I looked at every incident
report that night.

08:37.486 --> 08:40.921
The transit cop called
for a backup, to dispatch,

08:40.923 --> 08:42.789
and then canceled the request.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.508
Why would a policeman rescind
a request for backup?

08:44.510 --> 08:46.460
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

08:46.462 --> 08:48.879
I'm waiting on the transcripts
to find out why.

08:48.881 --> 08:50.348
Maybe it's time
I go meet Caleb's mom

08:50.350 --> 08:53.184
and find out
what his home life is like.

08:53.186 --> 08:54.702
Interesting.

08:54.704 --> 08:56.404
Caleb's latest
national aptitude test score

08:56.406 --> 08:57.671
is <i>exactly</i> 50%.

08:57.673 --> 09:01.609
A statistically
improbable score.

09:01.611 --> 09:03.277
Unless you try to get it.

09:03.279 --> 09:06.113
You see, Caleb knew the answer
to every question.

09:06.115 --> 09:08.366
But he chose only
to fill in every other one.

09:08.368 --> 09:10.868
I don't get it.
He tanked on purpose?

09:10.870 --> 09:16.540
Why would you want to hide
the fact you're a genius?

09:16.542 --> 09:18.626
Why, indeed?

09:35.095 --> 09:38.231
Caleb, a word?

09:40.317 --> 09:44.237
I couldn't help but notice this.

09:44.239 --> 09:45.805
No offense, Mr. Swift,

09:45.807 --> 09:48.825
but now you're going
through the garbage?

10:10.347 --> 10:11.631
Pi.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.217
Can any of you tell me
what it means?

10:16.804 --> 10:21.641
I'll settle for
an intelligent question here.

10:21.643 --> 10:23.393
My friend has a question,
Mr. Swift.

10:23.395 --> 10:25.395
"What is any of this good for,

10:25.397 --> 10:28.114
and when would we ever use it?"

10:31.953 --> 10:33.870
Let me show you.

10:33.872 --> 10:35.371
Pi.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.323
The ratio of the circumference
of a circle

10:37.325 --> 10:38.624
to its diameter.

10:38.626 --> 10:40.710
And this is just the beginning.

10:40.712 --> 10:41.994
It keeps on going.

10:41.996 --> 10:43.496
Forever.

10:43.498 --> 10:46.031
Without ever repeating.

10:46.033 --> 10:50.720
Which means that contained
within this string of decimals

10:50.722 --> 10:54.223
is every single other number.

10:54.225 --> 10:58.377
Your birth date, combination
to your locker,

10:58.379 --> 11:00.546
your social security number.

11:00.548 --> 11:04.150
It's all in there somewhere.

11:04.152 --> 11:07.403
And if you convert
these decimals into letters,

11:07.405 --> 11:10.606
you would have every word
that ever existed

11:10.608 --> 11:15.077
in every possible combination.

11:15.079 --> 11:18.164
The first syllable you spoke
as a baby,

11:18.166 --> 11:20.065
the name of your latest crush,

11:20.067 --> 11:23.035
your entire life story
from beginning to end.

11:23.037 --> 11:25.237
Everything we ever say or do...

11:25.239 --> 11:27.840
All of the world's infinite
possibilities rest

11:27.842 --> 11:31.127
within this one simple circle.

11:31.129 --> 11:34.680
Now what you do
with that information...

11:34.682 --> 11:37.133
What it's good for...

11:37.135 --> 11:41.637
Well, that would be up to you.

11:48.596 --> 11:50.095
NYPD, ma'am.

11:50.097 --> 11:51.614
We're investigating
a string of burglaries

11:51.616 --> 11:52.815
in the area.

11:52.817 --> 11:53.933
Talking
to residents about things

11:53.935 --> 11:55.434
they might have seen or heard.

11:55.436 --> 12:01.207
Mind if I come in
and ask you a few questions?

12:01.209 --> 12:04.794
I'm running a little late.

12:04.796 --> 12:07.112
So you, uh, you live alone?

12:07.114 --> 12:09.582
With my son Caleb.

12:09.584 --> 12:12.802
We don't have a lot of room,
so Caleb takes the couch.

12:14.172 --> 12:17.974
Uh, that's work.
Just give me a sec.

12:24.982 --> 12:27.433
So you and your son see
anything suspicious lately?

12:27.435 --> 12:29.735
Any strange comings and goings?

12:29.737 --> 12:31.136
Anyone who stands out?

12:31.138 --> 12:32.905
Nothing I can think of.

12:32.907 --> 12:34.323
Cops come a few times a year.

12:34.325 --> 12:36.409
It's domestic stuff mostly.

12:36.411 --> 12:40.746
Some families have it rough,
you know?

12:40.748 --> 12:43.749
Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

12:43.751 --> 12:47.587
Thanks for your time.

12:50.174 --> 12:51.757
Yes, Detective?

12:51.759 --> 12:53.509
I planted that webcam for you.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.160
Met Caleb's mom.

12:55.162 --> 12:56.929
Late for work, rolling
out the door with the shakes.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.598
My guess is
she's hitting the bottle.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.933
No wonder Caleb doesn't care
about his grades.

13:00.935 --> 13:02.518
Anything new on our two dealers?

13:02.520 --> 13:05.404
Diego Velasquez
and Ronnie Samms.

13:05.406 --> 13:07.640
Used to deal for a guy
by the name of Lorenzo.

13:07.642 --> 13:09.842
Type of guy
you don't wanna cross.

13:09.844 --> 13:12.028
But now they're working
for some new up-and-comer

13:12.030 --> 13:13.779
that narcotics
hasn't been able to identify.

13:13.781 --> 13:15.648
I tell you, that school's
a real minefield.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.066
Okay.

13:20.521 --> 13:23.789
Gonna keep your mouth shut,
right, chief?

13:26.192 --> 13:28.878
Yeah, sure.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.197
Except to say this.

13:32.199 --> 13:34.000
The next time you decide
you want to deal E

13:34.002 --> 13:35.635
to a kid who's clearly never
bought in his entire life,

13:35.637 --> 13:38.337
do it
in the locker room downstairs,

13:38.339 --> 13:39.805
because this jumpy fool

13:39.807 --> 13:48.230
is a neon sign shouting
"drugs ahoy"... Chief.

13:48.232 --> 13:50.382
That's enough!

13:50.384 --> 13:54.403
Unless you want to settle this
in the principal's office.

13:59.326 --> 14:00.826
Are you okay?

14:00.828 --> 14:04.580
I don't need your help... okay?

14:22.633 --> 14:28.087
"Hacker" used to refer
to industrious coders

14:28.089 --> 14:31.023
who pushed the boundaries
of modern computing.

14:31.025 --> 14:33.759
Then that word
became misappropriated

14:33.761 --> 14:36.762
by those who pushed
the boundaries so far

14:36.764 --> 14:38.097
that they ended up
with jail time.

14:38.099 --> 14:41.400
Like Kevin Mitnick,
back in the 1980s.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.619
He was just trying
to see how stuff worked.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.488
Mitnick was looking
for flaws in the system.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.406
And he did so
by breaking the law.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.125
But he proved people were
the flaw, not the code.

14:49.127 --> 14:50.910
Now they're paying him millions

14:50.912 --> 14:52.828
for the same thing that got him
locked up in the first place.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.951
Perhaps the most notorious
hacker of them all

14:58.953 --> 15:00.452
was the one that got away.

15:00.454 --> 15:02.555
Back when Uncle Sam was trying

15:02.557 --> 15:04.724
to maintain IriTrip
on the budding Internet...

15:04.726 --> 15:06.509
Or Arpanet,
as it was known then...

15:06.511 --> 15:09.478
This hacker, this coder,
hacked into the system

15:09.480 --> 15:11.130
and laid its secrets bare,

15:11.132 --> 15:15.017
ensuring that the Internet
would become an open forum.

15:15.019 --> 15:19.021
Plus that hacker made his mark
without ever getting busted.

15:19.023 --> 15:20.773
True.

15:20.775 --> 15:23.976
Whoever it was,
that person's still out there.

15:29.817 --> 15:31.450
Hey, I'm checking
on the boy genius.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.002
Not you, the other one.

15:33.004 --> 15:36.288
Turns out
he's quite the little coder.

15:36.290 --> 15:39.125
He's been coding
a massive program.

15:39.127 --> 15:41.510
In longhand, he doesn't
have a computer at home.

15:41.512 --> 15:44.830
Then he writes it
into a computer in the lab.

15:44.832 --> 15:47.099
If the partial code
I've discovered

15:47.101 --> 15:52.855
is a snapshot of his work...
What he's creating...

15:52.857 --> 15:55.808
Could be groundbreaking.

15:55.810 --> 15:58.510
Detective Fusco,
can you do something for me?

15:58.512 --> 16:00.062
I need you
to follow Diego and Ronnie.

16:00.064 --> 16:01.397
Caleb had a run-in
with them today

16:01.399 --> 16:02.815
that might lead to trouble.

16:02.817 --> 16:04.867
- Is there a history there?
- Hard to tell.

16:04.869 --> 16:06.368
But Caleb seemed

16:06.370 --> 16:08.487
to take an outsized interest
in their drug dealing.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.122
If someone's pulling
their strings,

16:10.124 --> 16:11.657
I'd like to know who.

16:34.397 --> 16:37.983
Finch, whoever this drug
dealer is, he's careful.

16:51.949 --> 16:55.618
Detective, how goes
phase one of your plan?

16:55.620 --> 16:57.203
I got
the package you sent over,

16:57.205 --> 16:59.338
but if I'm gonna wade
in this pool,

16:59.340 --> 17:00.873
I need the right specs.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.541
Yeah.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.076
Sending them to you now.

17:04.078 --> 17:07.880
Our friend in Rikers
is counting on you.

17:07.882 --> 17:11.717
- Okay.
- Knock 'em dead, Detective.

17:14.020 --> 17:17.138
They won't know
what hit 'em.

17:21.945 --> 17:23.695
Wow.

17:25.031 --> 17:28.483
Hi, I'd like to have...
The first one, on me.

17:28.486 --> 17:30.619
How are you doing?

17:30.621 --> 17:33.706
Thanks, but, um, I'm looking

17:33.708 --> 17:41.497
for something a little more...
Specific.

18:07.657 --> 18:10.280
Detective Fusco,
our Young man is on the move.

18:20.370 --> 18:21.837
Give you a ride home?

18:21.839 --> 18:23.088
Car is right down there.

18:23.090 --> 18:24.590
I'd like that.

18:24.592 --> 18:26.792
I have to admit,
you kind of threw me at first.

18:26.794 --> 18:29.044
Asking all those questions
about my background,

18:29.046 --> 18:30.679
my health.

18:30.681 --> 18:33.015
I couldn't tell whether
we were flirtin'

18:33.017 --> 18:34.300
or fillin' out
my medical history.

18:34.302 --> 18:35.667
I'm a practical girl.

18:35.669 --> 18:37.553
I like to know
what I'm getting into.

18:51.184 --> 18:54.904
So are we... Getting
into anything tonight?

18:54.906 --> 18:57.539
I am.

18:58.825 --> 19:00.993
Ooh, I don't know
what happened, but...

19:00.995 --> 19:03.362
I didn't even have
that much to drink.

19:03.364 --> 19:05.547
Yeah.

19:08.802 --> 19:12.638
Open wide, big fella.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.673
I've been following
this drug money all night.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.309
Diego and Ronnie
handed a bagful of it

19:17.311 --> 19:18.894
to a homeless guy,
who I followed

19:18.896 --> 19:20.879
till he dumped it off
at a money transfer place.

19:20.881 --> 19:22.181
The worker there wired it

19:22.183 --> 19:23.565
to another money hub
across town,

19:23.567 --> 19:26.051
where I hoofed it over there
just in time

19:26.053 --> 19:27.719
to see some other guy
pick up the cash

19:27.721 --> 19:30.055
and drop it in a P.O. box
right here in crown heights.

19:30.057 --> 19:32.658
Our mysterious drug lord
is laundering his money,

19:32.660 --> 19:34.410
making it untraceable.

19:34.412 --> 19:35.945
Well, not untraceable enough.

19:35.947 --> 19:38.831
Whoever comes in
for this cash is our guy.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.400
Where are you anyway?

19:41.402 --> 19:43.585
I'm looking at you.

19:46.256 --> 19:49.758
Thought you were following
the kid.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.294
I am.

19:55.515 --> 19:58.384
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.

20:06.359 --> 20:08.394
Well, I'll be damned.

20:08.396 --> 20:12.648
Our mystery drug lord
is Caleb.

20:24.639 --> 20:25.973
Graded your quizzes.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.292
Some of you have been
paying attention.

20:28.294 --> 20:33.147
Caleb, I expected better.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.267
Pssh.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.099
- What did the kid do now?
- Caleb just got a message.

20:52.101 --> 20:53.667
He's supposed
to meet his supplier at 2:00.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.319
We have to follow him.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.338
Tricky little bastard,
keeping his identity a secret.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.256
He's better
than most dealers twice his age.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.725
I'll be sure and tell him
how impressed you are

21:00.727 --> 21:02.326
with his criminal aptitude.

21:20.845 --> 21:24.031
Beckman just broke
into Caleb's account, Detective.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.784
He copying a file
named 17-6-21

21:26.786 --> 21:28.285
onto a thumb drive.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.321
Whatever Caleb's making...

21:30.323 --> 21:34.708
His teacher's interest in it...
Is far from academic.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.635
Oh, Mr. Phipps!

21:44.637 --> 21:47.421
Look, I'm kind of
on my way somewhere.

21:47.423 --> 21:48.756
I just wanted
to return something of yours.

21:48.758 --> 21:50.541
You dropped this yesterday.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.844
You really got to stop going
through the trash, Mr. Swift.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.547
You know, I used
to do a little coding myself.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.516
That's an elegant string
you have.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.151
But it occurs
to me that if you want

22:00.153 --> 22:01.735
to implement multi-threading,

22:01.737 --> 22:05.072
you'd do better
to use atomic variables.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.774
Just a thought.

22:08.893 --> 22:10.528
Wait, that...
That works.

22:10.530 --> 22:14.748
Yes, that's why
I suggested it.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.118
Uh, thanks.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.135
I hope you have your service
weapon with you, Detective.

22:34.137 --> 22:36.086
Yeah, I got you
a machine gun too.

22:36.088 --> 22:39.140
Very funny, Detective.
Let's try not to lose him.

22:44.813 --> 22:45.946
Yo, Roman.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.232
You here?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.153
Oh, jeez.

22:53.489 --> 22:55.072
Whoa.

22:56.575 --> 23:00.127
That's what
you came for, right?

23:00.129 --> 23:02.112
So tell me...

23:02.114 --> 23:04.748
Why would a kid like you
do something so stupid

23:04.750 --> 23:08.002
like dealing at a school
in my neighborhood?

23:10.555 --> 23:13.390
That's Lorenzo, all right,
Diego and Ronnie's old boss.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.726
What's the plan?

23:16.778 --> 23:18.762
Crap.

23:18.764 --> 23:22.650
You know, before he had
his little accident here...

23:22.652 --> 23:24.768
Roman was telling me
how you're just trying

23:24.770 --> 23:26.303
to score some bank
to take a big trip.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.022
That true?

23:28.024 --> 23:29.273
Yeah.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.742
You pay back
every dime you made

23:31.744 --> 23:35.362
selling to my customers,
I'll let you leave town intact.

23:35.364 --> 23:39.333
Be back here tomorrow
night, 8:00 P.M.,

23:39.335 --> 23:41.785
or I'll come find you.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.588
How do you expect me
to score that kind of cash

23:44.590 --> 23:45.956
in a day?

23:50.345 --> 23:51.879
Relax.

23:51.881 --> 23:54.932
All right, I'll...
Rob a bank or something.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.718
I like you.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.136
You got brass.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.889
But you don't show
tomorrow night...

24:01.891 --> 24:05.859
Break a lot more than your legs.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.882
Kid's got it tough.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.802
But picking a fight
with a drug dealer?

24:31.804 --> 24:34.421
A dumb move for a genius.

24:34.423 --> 24:36.373
Why would a Young man
with such potential

24:36.375 --> 24:39.493
risk it all just
to get some easy drug money?

24:39.495 --> 24:41.395
I don't think
it's about the money.

24:41.397 --> 24:44.348
I think it's about the brother.

24:45.884 --> 24:48.435
Dispatch transcripts
from the night Ryan Phipps died.

24:48.437 --> 24:51.689
Now the transit cop who filed
the report called for backup...

24:51.691 --> 24:53.407
Because Caleb initially reported

24:53.409 --> 24:56.277
that two youths got
into a shoving match with Ryan,

24:56.279 --> 24:57.695
pushed him onto the tracks.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.913
But the officer canceled
the backup call

24:59.915 --> 25:03.050
and filed
an accident report instead.

25:03.052 --> 25:06.754
Why would Caleb
change his story?

25:06.756 --> 25:08.405
Maybe he knew the killers.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.842
Maybe he was thinking about
taking care of them himself.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.927
Diego and Ronnie?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.713
He's manipulating
those morons.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.464
Got 'em running drugs for him,

25:17.466 --> 25:22.386
and they don't even know it.

25:22.388 --> 25:26.757
What's Beckner so absorbed in?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.525
That's Caleb's work.

25:30.646 --> 25:31.862
Howard, it's Chris.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.397
Can you still meet up tonight?

25:33.399 --> 25:35.783
I think you'll be impressed
with what you see.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.602
Great. I'll see you there.

25:38.604 --> 25:41.989
- Change of plans, Detective.
- Let me guess.

25:41.991 --> 25:43.240
You need me to keep an eye

25:43.242 --> 25:46.627
on little Einstein,
myself, tonight.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.296
Keep me posted.

25:53.968 --> 25:58.622
So, Mr. venture capital
firm partner...

25:58.624 --> 26:00.224
<i>Junior</i> partner.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.925
Long way from the corner office.

26:01.927 --> 26:04.461
Still have
to watch my step.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.897
- Pick my projects carefully.
- I get it.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.632
When you see this...

26:08.634 --> 26:11.235
Well, then, let's...
Let's just see it, Chris,

26:11.237 --> 26:15.489
so I can get back
to my wife and kids.

26:29.954 --> 26:31.338
What the hell was that?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.624
The library of congress.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.259
What?

26:35.261 --> 26:40.047
235 terabytes on...
On one thumb drive?

26:40.049 --> 26:42.766
The Internet's choking
on streaming video.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.351
They're gonna need
a new compression algorithm

26:44.353 --> 26:45.719
to continue growing.

26:45.721 --> 26:47.838
And I've got it.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.340
All I need is an investment
from a firm like yours

26:50.342 --> 26:52.008
to help me get it
off the ground.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.612
So... here's the thing,
Chris.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.849
I remember your code
from back in college.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.068
You were a medium talent
at best.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.620
There is no way that
<i>that</i> Chris Beckner

27:03.622 --> 27:06.407
designed something
this extraordinary.

27:06.409 --> 27:10.411
Unlike our old friends, I
didn't peak in college.

27:10.413 --> 27:12.629
So no one else knows
about this project?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.465
Programmers? Developers?

27:14.467 --> 27:17.050
No other entanglements?

27:17.052 --> 27:19.970
I can guarantee it.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.090
Well, let's hope so.

27:23.092 --> 27:26.226
Because I would hate for anyone
to come between you

27:26.228 --> 27:31.064
and what I believe is going
to be a very large check.

27:49.063 --> 27:50.679
Finally tracked down
that transit cop, Murphy.

27:50.681 --> 27:52.397
The one who was first
on the scene

27:52.399 --> 27:54.900
when Caleb's brother died.
Left a message for him

27:54.902 --> 27:56.351
to come down to the eighth
after his shift.

27:56.353 --> 27:58.904
Speaking of which,
where's the kid now?

27:58.906 --> 28:00.472
He's moving money around,
large amounts.

28:00.474 --> 28:02.357
Getting the cash
to pay off Lorenzo?

28:02.359 --> 28:03.775
No, he set up
some kind of a trust,

28:03.777 --> 28:05.660
and he's pouring
all his money into it.

28:05.662 --> 28:06.978
Maybe he's thinking
about taking that trip

28:06.980 --> 28:08.196
he's always talking about.

28:09.583 --> 28:11.716
Beckner just texted Caleb.

28:11.718 --> 28:13.685
<i>He</i> wants
to meet at 8:00 tonight.

28:13.687 --> 28:15.921
The same time he's supposed
to meet Lorenzo.

28:15.923 --> 28:17.989
And quantum physics
notwithstanding,

28:17.991 --> 28:19.758
he can't be
in two places at once.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.877
Unless I'm right,
and this kid's got a plan,

28:21.879 --> 28:23.962
time's running out
on two fronts.

28:23.964 --> 28:25.714
Maybe skipping town's
the best thing for him.

28:25.716 --> 28:28.266
Then we could focus some on
getting your pal out of lockup.

28:28.268 --> 28:29.834
Mr. Reese can take care
of himself, Detective.

28:29.836 --> 28:33.105
And right now,
he's in very capable hands.

28:33.107 --> 28:34.689
Detective Carter,

28:34.691 --> 28:37.275
time is ticking away fast
for our friend in Rikers.

28:37.277 --> 28:40.345
Don't worry.
I know what to do.

29:44.293 --> 29:46.511
Here you go.

29:46.513 --> 29:51.266
Mm. Sorry, honey.

29:51.268 --> 29:52.968
I'll be better tomorrow.

29:52.970 --> 29:56.754
I promise.

29:58.441 --> 30:00.859
Yeah.

30:00.861 --> 30:05.096
Everything's gonna
be better tomorrow, ma.

30:07.650 --> 30:09.367
Detective Fusco.

30:09.369 --> 30:12.237
I just want to remind you
that I need your help tonight.

30:12.239 --> 30:14.272
Caleb has two appointments,

30:14.274 --> 30:17.042
and we have no idea which one
he intends to keep.

30:17.044 --> 30:20.078
I'll be there.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.963
You wanted to speak with me?

30:21.965 --> 30:24.716
Yeah, have a seat,
officer Murphy.

30:24.718 --> 30:29.387
Like I said, I'm, uh...
Working on a cold case.

30:29.389 --> 30:30.972
Commuter got pushed.

30:30.974 --> 30:33.341
Looking for related cases,
this popped up.

30:33.343 --> 30:34.593
Ryan Phipps.

30:34.595 --> 30:36.461
Says here you were first
on the scene?

30:36.463 --> 30:38.513
Yeah, that's right.

30:38.515 --> 30:41.349
Kid was six months shy
of his 18th birthday.

30:41.351 --> 30:43.084
Coming home
with his little brother Caleb.

30:43.086 --> 30:45.937
Ryan was horsing around,
drinking a little bit.

30:45.939 --> 30:48.073
Slipped on the tracks
and got clipped.

30:48.075 --> 30:49.474
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

30:49.476 --> 30:51.993
It was a rough one.

30:51.995 --> 30:53.945
Because it was a kid?

30:53.947 --> 30:57.815
Or because you didn't report
the whole story?

30:57.817 --> 31:02.587
I know about the kids
who pushed Ryan on the tracks.

31:06.158 --> 31:07.292
I'm no Detective, Detective.

31:07.294 --> 31:09.678
I'm just a lowly transit cop.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.097
I seen a lot of things
in my time.

31:12.099 --> 31:14.466
And I made a lot
of decisions I regret.

31:14.468 --> 31:16.501
This is not one of those times.

31:16.503 --> 31:18.470
You may regret it
when Caleb becomes a killer.

31:18.472 --> 31:20.021
What are you talking about?

31:20.023 --> 31:21.723
You think revenge is gonna
make Caleb feel better

31:21.725 --> 31:23.341
about seeing his brother die?

31:23.343 --> 31:25.694
You're a long ways off,
Detective.

31:25.696 --> 31:28.480
Then give me some directions.

31:28.482 --> 31:29.731
You know, I did to the kid

31:29.733 --> 31:32.817
what you're doing
to me right now.

31:32.819 --> 31:34.736
When I asked him
for descriptions

31:34.738 --> 31:41.192
of the other kids...
Kept changing it up.

31:41.194 --> 31:42.210
There were no other kids.

31:42.212 --> 31:44.079
No.

31:44.081 --> 31:48.500
Just two brothers drinking.

31:48.502 --> 31:49.751
Bored.

31:49.753 --> 31:53.088
Waiting for a train
to go home.

31:53.090 --> 31:57.842
So they dare each other
to, uh... cross the tracks.

31:57.844 --> 32:01.546
You know, how many times
you can cross back and forth

32:01.548 --> 32:04.182
before a train comes?

32:04.184 --> 32:07.736
Well, Ryan doesn't want to lose
to his little brother.

32:07.738 --> 32:12.107
One kid makes it,
the other kid doesn't.

32:12.109 --> 32:17.195
I don't know
who got the better deal.

32:19.248 --> 32:22.000
So I told him I'd leave all that
out of the report,

32:22.002 --> 32:23.335
write it up as an accident,

32:23.337 --> 32:26.471
and for him
to keep it to himself.

32:26.473 --> 32:29.457
So no matter what he had
to tell his mom...

32:29.459 --> 32:34.129
Or the cops,
or God himself...

32:34.131 --> 32:37.749
Nothing was gonna bring
his brother back.

32:37.751 --> 32:39.351
What can I tell you?

32:39.353 --> 32:44.055
Some things you can't fix.

32:51.448 --> 32:53.815
Hey, I just talked
to Murphy.

32:53.817 --> 32:55.450
The brother's death
was an accident,

32:55.452 --> 32:57.535
but it sounds like
Caleb blames himself for it.

32:57.537 --> 32:59.070
Well, that's a problem,
Detective,

32:59.072 --> 33:00.789
because I lost Caleb.

33:00.791 --> 33:02.774
He got on a city bus, and it
left before I could catch up.

33:02.776 --> 33:04.626
You're kidding me.

33:04.628 --> 33:06.628
May I remind you that of the
many things I'm equipped to do,

33:06.630 --> 33:08.380
pursuit would not be chief
among them.

33:08.382 --> 33:10.114
Our only option now
is to wait for Caleb

33:10.116 --> 33:12.467
at the two places
he's likeliest to turn up.

33:12.469 --> 33:14.118
I'll stake out beckner
at the High School.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.046
You keep an eye out
for our aggrieved drug dealer.

33:24.296 --> 33:28.349
Get everyone,
and hunt that kid down!

33:30.737 --> 33:33.354
Our boy is a no-show,
and Lorenzo wants his head.

33:33.356 --> 33:34.539
You worry about the kid.

33:34.541 --> 33:36.491
I'll take care of Lorenzo.

33:37.860 --> 33:40.144
He's
not here either, Detective.

33:40.146 --> 33:44.413
I may be too late.

33:46.869 --> 33:48.503
Swift,
what are you doing here?

33:48.505 --> 33:49.987
I was gonna ask you the same.

33:49.989 --> 33:51.456
- I-I left some papers on...
- Stop it!

33:51.458 --> 33:53.041
I saw you break
into Caleb's account

33:53.043 --> 33:54.492
and copy his files.

33:54.494 --> 33:56.294
Is that what you're willing
to stoop to?

33:56.296 --> 33:59.292
Stealing the work of a student
and passing it off as your own?

33:59.293 --> 34:00.715
I am not gonna stand here

34:00.717 --> 34:02.667
and be accused of plagiarism
by some substitute teacher.

34:02.669 --> 34:05.637
Besides, why would I copy work
off of a "C"-grade student?

34:05.639 --> 34:08.917
Because Caleb
is anything but average.

34:08.918 --> 34:10.809
And you know it.

34:10.811 --> 34:16.231
That's why you took his work
to your friend.

34:16.233 --> 34:20.851
Caleb... Approached
me a few months ago

34:20.853 --> 34:23.571
about this project
he was working on.

34:23.572 --> 34:27.024
I was skeptical,
but when I... saw his code

34:27.025 --> 34:28.877
I couldn't believe my eyes,
so I decided to help him.

34:28.879 --> 34:30.462
- By cutting him out of it.
- No.

34:30.464 --> 34:31.830
All he wanted was
some money up front

34:31.831 --> 34:33.297
for this trip that he wants
to take.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.666
Said he didn't even want
any credit.

34:34.668 --> 34:36.417
Why on earth
would you agree to that?

34:36.418 --> 34:39.337
I didn't.

34:41.639 --> 34:44.259
Read it for yourself.

34:44.261 --> 34:47.043
Caleb gets all the credit.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.730
It was just easier for me to...

34:48.732 --> 34:51.014
Pitch the idea
with him myself...

34:51.016 --> 34:53.400
Get some capital...

34:53.402 --> 34:55.436
And then reveal
the true brain behind it.

34:55.438 --> 34:57.772
He offered me half
if I put the other half

34:57.774 --> 35:00.825
in a trust that he set up
for his mom.

35:00.827 --> 35:03.661
But I'm giving him
the whole thing.

35:03.663 --> 35:06.731
All the money from 17-6-21.

35:06.733 --> 35:08.500
17-6-21?

35:08.502 --> 35:10.335
It's the name
he gave the program.

35:10.337 --> 35:12.036
He said it was some kind
of dedication.

35:12.038 --> 35:14.589
Look, I am telling you,
six months from now,

35:14.591 --> 35:16.591
Caleb is going
to be the richest 18-year-old

35:16.593 --> 35:18.877
in the country.

35:18.879 --> 35:22.079
No.

35:22.081 --> 35:24.539
No, he won't.

35:35.132 --> 35:36.214
Dispatch?
Officer Murphy,

35:36.216 --> 35:37.632
regarding the subway fatality.

35:39.402 --> 35:41.586
10-5, officer.
Cancel backup request?

35:41.588 --> 35:43.555
Affirmative.

35:56.134 --> 35:59.616
This seat taken?

36:12.284 --> 36:13.918
What are you doing here?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.803
You're so smart, Caleb.

36:15.805 --> 36:19.807
Ask me something you <i>don't</i> know.

36:22.644 --> 36:25.045
The thing
about being reckless...

36:25.047 --> 36:27.231
Taking chances...

36:27.233 --> 36:28.933
Is that you make
a lot of mistakes,

36:28.935 --> 36:30.401
cause a lot of grief.

36:30.403 --> 36:34.021
Gonna start lecturing me
on mistakes?

36:34.023 --> 36:36.574
How I need to live and learn?

36:36.576 --> 36:39.110
Move on?

36:39.112 --> 36:42.163
That's really inspiring,
Mr. Swift.

36:42.165 --> 36:46.167
I'd stand up on my desk
and clap for you.

36:46.169 --> 36:51.539
But... No.

36:51.541 --> 36:53.541
Your mistakes, like mine,

36:53.543 --> 36:55.459
are part of who you are now.

36:55.461 --> 36:59.913
You can't move on from that.

36:59.915 --> 37:01.415
Believe me.

37:01.417 --> 37:04.751
I've made a sizable number.

37:04.753 --> 37:10.107
But... Sometimes your
mistakes can surprise you.

37:10.109 --> 37:15.796
My biggest mistake,
for instance...

37:15.798 --> 37:17.531
Brought me here.

37:17.533 --> 37:19.417
At exactly this moment...

37:19.419 --> 37:22.769
When you might need some help.

37:22.771 --> 37:28.042
17 years, 6 months
and 21 days into your life.

37:28.044 --> 37:30.628
The age
at which your brother died.

37:30.630 --> 37:35.132
The age you've chosen
to end your life too.

37:35.134 --> 37:39.870
17-6-21.

37:43.175 --> 37:49.180
So, you see... Maybe you
and I are connected.

37:49.182 --> 37:52.733
Two reckless people.

37:55.604 --> 37:58.322
Yeah? Then what's the use?

37:58.324 --> 38:01.525
We're just gonna keep
breaking things...

38:01.527 --> 38:05.812
Over and over.

38:05.814 --> 38:09.650
Why not save everyone the grief?

38:09.652 --> 38:11.502
The thing about the world is

38:11.504 --> 38:15.256
that it doesn't have
any extra pieces.

38:15.258 --> 38:17.258
It's like pi.
It contains everything.

38:17.260 --> 38:22.513
You remove a single piece...
No circle.

38:22.515 --> 38:24.515
Your recklessness,
your mistakes,

38:24.517 --> 38:26.967
are the reason why,
when they say

38:26.969 --> 38:31.171
"you can't change the world,"
you won't listen.

38:31.173 --> 38:32.339
The world is better off

38:32.341 --> 38:35.059
with both of us in it, Caleb,

38:35.061 --> 38:38.195
- rather than the alternative.
- Yeah? You sure about that?

38:38.197 --> 38:40.064
Yes, and your mom is
better off with you in it.

38:40.066 --> 38:46.036
If you think
money can replace you...

38:46.038 --> 38:50.124
You haven't seen
the whole equation.

38:50.126 --> 38:52.376
Take it
from someone who thought

38:52.378 --> 38:58.198
that leaving would make it
easier on everyone...

38:58.200 --> 39:00.880
And then learned otherwise.

39:55.690 --> 39:57.024
Say it to me again.

39:57.026 --> 39:58.108
Slowly.

39:58.110 --> 39:59.643
According to the lab results,

39:59.645 --> 40:02.062
none of the DNA we took
from these four men

40:02.064 --> 40:03.647
matches any of the DNA
in our database.

40:03.649 --> 40:05.399
They're clean, sir.
All four of 'em.

40:05.401 --> 40:07.735
I want every one of
those samples sent to Quantico,

40:07.737 --> 40:10.788
reviewed through codis,
and inspected for tampering.

40:10.790 --> 40:12.823
They got to it.

40:12.825 --> 40:15.743
I don't know how,
but those bastards got to it.

40:15.745 --> 40:17.944
Go.

40:17.946 --> 40:19.863
One more thing.

40:19.865 --> 40:23.083
Get me Carter.

40:33.178 --> 40:36.981
You really ought to be
more careful with your code.

40:42.687 --> 40:43.988
Thanks.

40:47.525 --> 40:50.694
I grew up during
the Cold War...

40:50.696 --> 40:52.830
When computer networks
were just a gleam

40:52.832 --> 40:55.833
in the eye
of the department of defense.

40:55.835 --> 40:58.035
Things seemed
more black and white then.

40:58.037 --> 41:01.672
Arpanet was the new frontier.

41:01.674 --> 41:03.657
Till a kid
with a homemade computer

41:03.659 --> 41:04.958
turned the whole thing
inside out.

41:04.960 --> 41:09.129
All I'm saying is...
It's a new era now,

41:09.131 --> 41:13.851
and things are about
to get <i>really</i> weird.

41:13.853 --> 41:18.004
So you should keep your code
close to your vest.

41:19.891 --> 41:22.276
And pick your friends wisely.

41:25.313 --> 41:27.147
Pi.

41:27.149 --> 41:30.117
The first 3,000 digits.

41:30.119 --> 41:34.521
My number's in there somewhere.

41:34.523 --> 41:38.158
You're smart,
you'll figure it out.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.194
Wait, uh, the hacker.

41:41.196 --> 41:43.914
The one who got away?

41:43.916 --> 41:45.966
How'd you know he did that
with a homemade computer?

41:45.968 --> 41:49.703
I've read all that research.
No one's ever mentioned that.

41:49.705 --> 41:52.539
I must have heard it
somewhere.

42:06.888 --> 42:08.305
Detective Carter?

42:08.307 --> 42:10.023
Has our friend in Rikers
been released?

42:10.025 --> 42:12.142
Almost. I'm going
to meet him now.

42:15.498 --> 42:18.282
Your DNA wasn't a match for
whoever they're looking for.

42:18.284 --> 42:23.337
We'll be processing you out
momentarily.

42:35.049 --> 42:37.968
Stop right there.

42:37.970 --> 42:39.252
These men have
all been classified

42:39.254 --> 42:41.305
as "unlawful combatants"
by the AUMF.

42:41.307 --> 42:43.023
Until we can establish
that they're not a threat

42:43.025 --> 42:45.926
to national security,
they're not going anywhere.

42:47.262 --> 42:51.097
Put him back.

42:51.099 --> 42:54.535
Just the person
I wanted to see.

42:54.537 --> 42:55.953
What is going on?

42:55.955 --> 42:57.771
I thought the evidence
cleared these guys.

42:57.773 --> 43:00.407
The DNA, the fingerprints,
it's all too neat.

43:00.409 --> 43:01.575
I've been burned too many times

43:01.577 --> 43:03.276
trying to bring this man
to justice.

43:03.278 --> 43:05.829
There's only one person
that I know I can trust anymore:

43:05.831 --> 43:07.798
You.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.466
You've been chasing him
from the beginning.

43:09.468 --> 43:12.386
And we've only got one shot left
at him, Detective.

43:12.388 --> 43:14.721
If he walks out of here,
we're never gonna see him again.

43:14.723 --> 43:18.091
I know you were
a senior interrogator in Iraq.

43:18.093 --> 43:20.060
It's time to put
those military skills to use.

43:20.062 --> 43:22.146
I want you to interrogate
every last one of these men.

43:22.148 --> 43:24.148
Find out who they are,
what they know.

43:24.150 --> 43:27.484
Start with him.
