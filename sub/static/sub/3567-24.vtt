WEBVTT

00:04.288 --> 00:07.114
Steven, hurry up!

00:07.691 --> 00:09.392
Are you okay?

00:09.493 --> 00:13.229
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?

00:13.330 --> 00:17.500
Yeah.

00:17.567 --> 00:22.305
Okay. Uh, so, um...
Is this fence new?

00:22.372 --> 00:25.374
Eh... it's a long story.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.779
- Is it a magic story?!
- M-M-M-a-a-a-ybe...?

00:29.846 --> 00:32.682
Well, what happened?!
Tell me. Please?

00:32.749 --> 00:36.519
Okay, okay.
But it's not a happy story.

00:36.586 --> 00:39.188
<i>Amethyst was horsing
around by the cliff.</i>

00:39.256 --> 00:41.791
Amethyst, be careful!

00:41.858 --> 00:44.627
Steven, why you getting so
worked up?

00:44.695 --> 00:47.630
What ... do you care about me or
something?

00:47.698 --> 00:50.232
- Yes!
- Aw, Steven, I

00:50.334 --> 00:52.601
didn't mean to make you ...
whoa-a-a-a-a-a!

00:52.703 --> 00:55.137
Amethyst, stop!
You're gonna fall!

00:55.238 --> 00:57.640
Ooh!
Steven, I'm

00:57.708 --> 00:59.825
- gonna fa-a-ll!
- Amethyst, you're

00:59.910 --> 01:02.378
- gonna get hurt!
- Steven, please.

01:02.412 --> 01:04.580
I'm a gem warrior.
I'm not gonna fa...

01:05.894 --> 01:08.417
Ugh. This is so embarrassing.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.254
<i>I'm okay!</i>

01:12.339 --> 01:15.558
So, I ran down there
as fast as I could.

01:21.898 --> 01:24.600
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, Steven.

01:24.684 --> 01:27.269
I'm fine, except for this!

01:27.354 --> 01:29.105
- Amethyst!
- Great.

01:29.189 --> 01:34.377
- Show me your gem!
- Fresh!

01:34.444 --> 01:36.579
Amethyst, your gem is cracked!

01:36.646 --> 01:39.415
Rude!
It's not a big deal!

01:39.516 --> 01:41.684
Plus, now I have this cool
googly eye!

01:41.752 --> 01:44.286
How did this happen?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.455
She fell off the
cliff by the lighthouse.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.557
- Did not!
- Of course.

01:48.658 --> 01:52.428
How could I have been so blind?
We need to put a fence up there

01:52.496 --> 01:57.600
- so this will never happen again!
- And that's why there's a fence. The end.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.904
- Wait, what happened to Amethyst?
- Uh...

02:01.972 --> 02:05.441
- Come on. Tell me the rest!
- I don't wanna.

02:05.509 --> 02:09.311
Steven?
Steven...

02:09.413 --> 02:11.730
- Mm...
- Steven!

02:14.197 --> 02:17.703
Okay, okay! But only if you
let me try on your glasses.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.872
Only if you give me the rest
of your juice.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.957
Okay, but it's mostly backwash.

02:21.992 --> 02:25.711
- Good enough.
- How do I look?

02:25.829 --> 02:30.766
- I have no idea.
- Well, um, so...

02:30.834 --> 02:32.935
Uh, we were all worried about Amethyst.

02:33.003 --> 02:34.225
So, what's the problem?

02:34.226 --> 02:38.240
- Amethyst falls on stuff all the time.
- It'd be fine if it was

02:38.308 --> 02:40.409
just her body, but her gem is damaged.

02:40.477 --> 02:42.611
So what do you do to fix it?

02:42.679 --> 02:45.347
Before...
we had Rose.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.560
Steven, your mother
had healing tears that

02:48.561 --> 02:51.520
flowed from her gem. She
felt real love for those

02:51.588 --> 02:54.940
around her. She felt real
sorrow when they were hurt.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.335
You have the Rose Quartz gem now.

02:57.336 --> 03:02.226
- I know that power is in you, too.
- Amethyst, show me your gem!

03:02.227 --> 03:03.766
Yeah, all right.

03:03.834 --> 03:07.253
The power to heal.

03:12.242 --> 03:15.461
It's not working. I guess
I'm just too tough to cry.

03:15.545 --> 03:17.963
Just today, you were
crying about snakes.

03:18.048 --> 03:21.423
- They don't have any arms!
- We have no choice.

03:21.424 --> 03:24.797
We need to take Amethyst to
Rose's healing spring.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.389
Guys, I'm fine.
I'm not gonna get any

03:27.474 --> 03:32.394
wor-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r...
r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r...

03:32.462 --> 03:35.231
_

03:38.401 --> 03:41.787
And in the center of
the garden ... Rose's fountain,

03:41.872 --> 03:46.408
overflowing with your mother's
healing, lachrymal essence!

03:46.459 --> 03:48.377
- I don't see it.
- Wha...

03:48.445 --> 03:52.122
_

03:52.157 --> 03:53.382
Now, now!

03:53.483 --> 03:56.318
Uh, let's keep it together!
Our memories of Rose can't be

03:56.419 --> 03:58.287
tainted by some overgrown brambles!

03:58.355 --> 04:01.924
Look at them. They're
a mess without her guidance.

04:01.992 --> 04:05.294
Directionless, pathetic,
clinging things.

04:05.362 --> 04:08.497
- It's going to be okay, Garnet.
- Sure.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.299
Y-Y-You really think so?

04:10.367 --> 04:14.820
Healing tears!

04:16.990 --> 04:19.858
Hmm.
Maybe there's a path over here!

04:34.791 --> 04:38.360
Pain can make one cry.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.696
Where is pain?

04:48.388 --> 04:50.356
Amethyst, no more roughhousing!

04:50.440 --> 04:52.397
You'll exacerbate your crack!

04:52.524 --> 04:55.332
_

05:00.116 --> 05:03.452
Aw, right in the gem.

05:03.486 --> 05:08.624
_

05:08.692 --> 05:12.461
Ohh! Oh! Keep calm.
What we need to do is get you

05:12.495 --> 05:15.497
Into the fountain immediately,
if we can ever find the way

05:15.582 --> 05:18.334
- under all this mess!
- Shh.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.841
I needed that.
This way.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.427
We could've probably gotten in

05:28.511 --> 05:31.057
without hurtling a giant
rock into Rose's most

05:31.058 --> 05:33.766
precious sanctuary!
But if you're okay with it,

05:33.850 --> 05:37.276
I'm fine, too!

05:37.687 --> 05:39.722
This isn't right.

05:45.528 --> 05:47.563
- The fountain isn't running.
- What?

05:47.631 --> 05:50.532
- W-What's wrong with it?
- I'm not sure.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.504
Is that... mom?
Oh, oh, I'm getting emotional!

05:55.588 --> 05:59.975
I think it's happening!
Uh, I'm really feeling it!

06:03.371 --> 06:05.547
Headache!

06:05.649 --> 06:09.652
So give back my glasses and
finish the story!

06:09.919 --> 06:12.721
Ah, come on! I had it!

06:12.772 --> 06:15.974
Steven, it's fine. Just ...

06:16.059 --> 06:18.560
just stay here and watch Amethyst.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.779
We'll find out what's wrong with
the fountain.

06:20.864 --> 06:25.818
No, no. Wait!
I can still do it!

06:25.902 --> 06:28.404
Wait, wait!

06:28.488 --> 06:31.373
It might still happen!
Guys?

06:35.688 --> 06:38.116
_

06:39.435 --> 06:44.119
I can't understand you!
I don't understand anything!

06:44.187 --> 06:46.805
Why is everyone acting so strange?

06:46.890 --> 06:51.927
Why can't I ...
why can't I cry?!

06:52.011 --> 06:57.178
<i>Why can't I cry?</i>

06:57.179 --> 06:58.901
It's just...

06:58.968 --> 07:01.883
I mean, I don't know
how to feel about you,

07:01.884 --> 07:04.064
but everybody else does.

07:04.065 --> 07:06.608
I wish I could have met you.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.945
Then this place could make me
sad, and I could cry

07:09.996 --> 07:15.177
healing tears, like you.

07:15.535 --> 07:19.088
Are you okay?

07:19.122 --> 07:20.589
Keep going.

07:42.896 --> 07:49.005
Amethyst, Where's your gem?

07:57.827 --> 08:00.097
Amethyst, I'm sorry!

08:00.098 --> 08:03.048
I can't do anything right.

08:03.133 --> 08:06.168
Now I'm going to lose
you, and it's all my fault.

08:06.219 --> 08:11.173
Ha, ha.
You care about me.

08:13.309 --> 08:16.678
Please let me be a magic healer.

08:23.853 --> 08:26.572
Oh, come on!

08:51.703 --> 08:56.969
Look at this guy,
saving my life and junk.

08:57.053 --> 09:00.504
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Did you see what I did?

09:00.539 --> 09:01.139
It was magic!

09:01.224 --> 09:05.027
My tears brought the fountain
back to life and saved Amethyst!

09:05.061 --> 09:07.563
I'm pretty sure Garnet
and I unplugging a clogged

09:07.614 --> 09:09.731
chamber brought the
fountain back to life.

09:09.816 --> 09:13.068
- We saved Amethyst.
- You don't think my

09:13.203 --> 09:15.737
crying was a little related to that?

09:15.822 --> 09:19.324
Oh, Steven, you don't
have healing tears.

09:19.409 --> 09:22.294
You'll never have any real magic
powers, and we don't want

09:22.378 --> 09:25.964
- anything more to do with you.
- She didn't really say that.

09:26.049 --> 09:28.917
No, but that's what it felt like.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.721
Is that why you've been so down?

09:32.755 --> 09:35.757
Oh.
You can have your juice back.

09:35.808 --> 09:38.927
Nah, that's okay.

09:39.062 --> 09:41.146
Everyone expects me to be like my mom.

09:41.264 --> 09:43.148
What if I never get those powers?

09:43.266 --> 09:45.817
Then you'll be like me.
That's not so bad.

09:45.902 --> 09:49.104
But if I don't have
powers, then I can't hang out

09:49.155 --> 09:53.825
with Amethyst or Garnet or
Pearl, and I-I can't

09:53.910 --> 09:56.945
- go on missions!
- You don't need any powers

09:56.996 --> 10:00.249
to be here with me.

10:03.384 --> 10:05.037
Ow. Ugh.

10:05.121 --> 10:07.322
- What's wrong?
- I think ...

10:07.390 --> 10:09.758
There's just ...
there's something wrong with my

10:09.859 --> 10:13.505
glasses.
My... My eyes.

10:13.506 --> 10:15.330
I-I-I can see!

10:15.398 --> 10:17.900
- What?
- I can see without my glasses!

10:17.967 --> 10:24.406
Did I heal your eyes?
But how?

10:24.474 --> 10:27.709
The juice box!

10:27.777 --> 10:31.914
I don't have healing tears!
I have healing spit!

10:31.981 --> 10:34.082
What am I going to tell my parents?

10:34.150 --> 10:36.285
What am I going to tell my optometrist?!

10:36.352 --> 10:39.221
I don't even know!
Oh, thank you, Connie!

10:39.289 --> 10:42.893
Lion, let's go tell the gems!
They're never gonna believe this!
