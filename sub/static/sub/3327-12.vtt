00:02.800 --> 00:06.031
MAN (on TV):
Here's Owens, the Welshman.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.493
Nice piece of skill
to get past Neep.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.405
Still Owens, heading toward
the penalty area.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.805
Wide it goes to Marwick.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.808
Marwick with it.
Touch inside to Williams.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.671
Williams with a lovely chip
toward the back post.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.803
Mountroy is there.
It's in the net!

00:17.850 --> 00:19.477
A scorching header
from Mountroy,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.147
and Manchester United
are back on top!

00:21.180 --> 00:22.545
It'_s 2-1 here as Arsenal
again caught ball-watching

00:22.590 --> 00:23.716
in the defensive end.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.116
(turns TV off, man grunting)

00:26.160 --> 00:29.687
(grunting continues)

00:29.730 --> 00:31.220
(sighs)

00:31.260 --> 00:33.694
(muffled grunting continues)

00:37.300 --> 00:39.393
(frantic grunting)

00:39.440 --> 00:41.829
(muffled):
No. No.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.338
No! No!

00:44.370 --> 00:46.406
(grunting)

00:46.440 --> 00:50.069
No.No!No!

00:50.110 --> 00:52.749
(grunting)

00:59.560 --> 01:01.710
No!

01:01.760 --> 01:04.183
No!

01:06.160 --> 01:07.354
(panﬁng)

01:07.400 --> 01:10.722
(grunting)

01:17.410 --> 01:19.833
(buzzing)

01:21.240 --> 01:22.798
WATSON:
What are bees doing in here?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.375
Buzzing.
No. I mean,

01:25.410 --> 01:27.617
why aren't they on the
roof with the others?

01:27.650 --> 01:29.709
I'm seeing how the indoor
temperature suits them.

01:29.750 --> 01:33.356
Our six weeks together
are very nearly up, Watson.

01:33.390 --> 01:36.223
In a matter of days,
your room will be vacant.

01:36.260 --> 01:37.625
I'm very seriously
considering

01:37.660 --> 01:39.696
turning it into
one large apiary.

01:39.730 --> 01:42.119
Finally the space
will serve a purpose.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.728
Oh, you say
the nicest things.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.797
The end of our companionship
is actually what I wanted

01:47.840 --> 01:49.660
to talk
to you about.
Do tell.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.507
Well, when I'm wrapping up
with a client,

01:51.540 --> 01:53.337
I like to carry out
exit protocols.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.201
Sounds _ominous.
No, we Just need
to carve out a time to talk.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.649
It's time I told
you, Watson.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.318
You place far too much
emphasis on talking.

01:59.350 --> 02:01.818
Most of what we humans _have
to say to one another IS

02:01.850 --> 02:03.442
communicated haptically.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.583
When I think
of the many thousands of words

02:05.620 --> 02:07.713
that you yourself have wasted
during your time here...

02:07.760 --> 02:10.285
We'll go to dinner, we'll talk--
verbally, haptically, whatever.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.890
I think the whole point is
to reflect on your progress.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.898
Reflection is for mirrors. Can't
you Just hand me a report card?

02:14.930 --> 02:16.898
Well, I am working
on a final assessment,

02:16.930 --> 02:18.921
but that is for your father.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.461
Right, 'cause he's the one
paying your exorbitant fees.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.502
Actually, my fees are
the opposite of exorbitant.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.905
He'll probably put it
on his fridge

02:24.940 --> 02:26.805
with his many colorful magnets.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.274
Oh, no, wait. He doesn't have
any magnets or interest in me.

02:29.310 --> 02:31.198
(phone ringing)

02:32.520 --> 02:34.943
Captain Gregson, how
may I be of assistance?

02:34.980 --> 02:38.746
The owner of the house is a CPA
by the name of Ian Vickers.

02:38.790 --> 02:41.918
We're pretty sure
he's also the victim.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.178
And by "pretty sure,"
you mean...

02:44.230 --> 02:47.427
I mean there's no body.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.769
Just blood.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.495
This is all
from one person?

02:51.530 --> 02:54.499
Well, we pulled some hairs
out of a comb in his bathroom

02:54.540 --> 02:57.429
to check the DNA,
so, yeah, for now.

02:57.470 --> 03:01.236
Vickers' secretary
dropped off some files,

03:01.280 --> 03:02.542
and found the place
like this.

03:02.580 --> 03:07.313
Hard to like his chances,
given all this.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.944
Hey. You okay?

03:09.990 --> 03:12.208
GREGSON:
So, aside

03:12.260 --> 03:14.251
from the blood,
the scene is clean.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.850
No footprints, no witnesses,
no nothing.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.620
Whoever did this-- we don't
know the first thing about him.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.854
He's tall.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.265
I beg your pardon?

03:22.300 --> 03:24.427
He's tall. Strong, too.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.631
He'd have to be
to hang his victims from a hook.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.264
Hook's gone now, but it
was at one point attached

03:29.310 --> 03:31.301
to a tripod device of
the killer's own design.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.331
He assembled it
after he incapacitated Vickers,

03:33.380 --> 03:35.268
then hung him upside down,
slit his throat.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.902
Gravity and the last few
beats of his heart drove

03:36.950 --> 03:38.372
every last ounce of blood
from his body.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.809
GREGSON:
A tripod device?

03:39.850 --> 03:42.614
Here. It's from
one of its legs.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.242
There are two
more groove marks

03:44.290 --> 03:48.010
inside the perimeter of the
blood-- there and there.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.948
After he'd completely
drained Vickers,

03:49.990 --> 03:51.958
he dismantled the
device, taking it

03:51.990 --> 03:54.629
and the exsanguinated corpse
of his victim with him.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.322
How the hell did you deduce all
that from this pool of blood?

03:57.370 --> 04:00.362
I didn't deduce anything,
actually.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.733
I've stalked
this particular madman before.

04:03.770 --> 04:06.534
In London.

04:24.060 --> 04:25.982
M.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.851
A simple moniker
for a complicated monster.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.721
He is, without question,
the most sinister taker of lives

04:31.770 --> 04:33.795
I have ever had the displeasure
of pursuing.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.707
He's been active
since January 2002.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.764
During the last ten years,

04:37.810 --> 04:40.802
he has tallied a body count
of 37.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.899
His image has never
been captured.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.042
He is methodical.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.548
He is as efficient
as he IS clean.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.844
And he also has no type
or victim profile,

04:48.880 --> 04:50.711
which makes it almost impossible

04:50.750 --> 04:53.719
to predict when, where,
or whom he might strike.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.012
His oldest victim in the
U.K. was in her late 805.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.779
The youngest-- 12.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.957
He drains his victims
of his or her blood,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.922
then dumps their bodies
in the ocean.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.097
_ Bodies of 21 of his
Victims were recovered

05:05.130 --> 05:07.098
when they washed up
on the coastline.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.109
The other 16 were, presumably,
carried out to sea.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.903
And I wouldn't be surprised

05:11.940 --> 05:13.100
if the body of
his latest victim,

05:13.140 --> 05:15.005
Mr. Vickers,
were to make an appearance

05:15.040 --> 05:17.747
on one of your beaches
in the next few days.

05:17.780 --> 05:19.042
I'm gonna call
the Coast Guard,

05:19.080 --> 05:20.775
tell them to keep
an eye out?
Yeah.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.947
I trust that the lab
has by now confirmed

05:22.990 --> 05:25.117
that the blood
at the scene was Vickers'?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.811
All 12 pints of it.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.384
M's fascination with blood is

05:28.420 --> 05:31.355
as mysterious
as the man himself.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.494
He mentions it in his, uh,

05:33.530 --> 05:34.792
correspondence
with the police...

05:34.830 --> 05:36.593
(muttering)

05:36.630 --> 05:38.860
...but only rarely.
You'll notice that he has

05:38.900 --> 05:39.969
a tendency to ramble.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.865
Do not be fooled.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.698
I have long suspected
that M isn't nearly as mad

05:44.740 --> 05:46.139
as he would like us to believe.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.968
His letters are, in my humble
estimation, a feint,

05:49.010 --> 05:50.739
an attempt to make
the authorities, or anyone

05:50.780 --> 05:52.577
who would attempt
to analyze him,

05:52.620 --> 05:54.770
believe that he is one thing,
when he is, in fact, another.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.139
Finally, M tends

05:56.180 --> 05:58.944
to kill in bunches,
so the whole NYPD

05:58.990 --> 06:00.855
should be prepared
for more bodies to drop.

06:00.890 --> 06:02.016
I've brought my
own personal files

06:02.060 --> 06:03.857
on M to the station,

06:03.890 --> 06:05.824
and I'm arranging them
for your consumption.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.693
(indistinct chatter)

06:08.730 --> 06:10.425
Hey. How are
you doing?

06:10.470 --> 06:11.994
Quite well. Why?

06:12.030 --> 06:13.588
You seem oddly chipper.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.993
Ido?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.667
Yeah, and last night,
at the crime scene--

06:16.710 --> 06:18.530
the way you were
staring at the blood.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.003
Well, I was struck,
I suppose.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.008
I mean, the moment
I laid eyes on the scene,

06:22.040 --> 06:25.908
I knew it could only be
the handiwork of... M.

06:25.950 --> 06:26.814
And this morning?

06:30.690 --> 06:32.954
Ten years ago,
when M first started killing,

06:32.990 --> 06:35.811
I was an integral part
of the investigation.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.954
By the time he had claimed
his 36th life, however,

06:38.990 --> 06:40.855
my addiction was
out of control.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.460
I was, I'm quite
embarrassed to say,

06:43.500 --> 06:44.967
useless to the police.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.888
Now, his appearance here
in the States--

06:46.940 --> 06:48.464
it's a second chance for me.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.832
It's an opportunity to do
what I should have done

06:50.870 --> 06:53.100
a long time ago-- bring
a ruthless killer to justice.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.971
Let me ask you something.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.149
This-this M character--
what, uh...

06:57.180 --> 07:00.115
What was his awareness
of you back in London?

07:00.150 --> 07:03.039
Oh, he may have referenced me
in a letter or two. Why?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.650
Seems sort of coincidental,
don't you think?

07:05.690 --> 07:07.783
Him coming to New York
so soon after you?

07:07.820 --> 07:10.653
Well, H...
I hadn't considered that.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.829
Really?
I suppose

07:12.860 --> 07:15.556
it is a little odd-- flattering
if you think about it.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.625
Hmm. I'm gonna post
a couple uniforms

07:17.670 --> 07:19.831
in front of your place
until further notice.

07:19.870 --> 07:22.031
Captain, I hardly
think that's necessary.
Much appreciated. Thank you.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.199
Hey, just a reminder that
I have an appointment

07:25.240 --> 07:28.630
in a little while, but I will
be back in a couple of hours.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.500
I shall count the seconds
until your return.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.474
Well, in the meantime, I thought
I could dig into the M files.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.078
You have so many.
I can help.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.678
Actually, Watson,
it occurs to me

07:36.720 --> 07:38.984
that help from you is the
last thing that I need.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.487
Much as it pains
me to admit it,

07:40.520 --> 07:41.987
you have become
something of a crutch.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.829
I need to get used to
working by myself again.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.851
Are you sure?
Positive.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.221
In fact, I encourage you

07:47.260 --> 07:48.852
to leave for your
appointment immediately.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.788
This is good. Exciting.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.663
I shall keep you apprised
of my progress via e-mail.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.699
WATSON:
So, it's been a while

07:56.740 --> 07:58.537
since I've been here.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.174
It's been really busy.

08:00.210 --> 08:02.007
With?

08:02.040 --> 08:04.838
Sherlock. It's our
last week together,

08:04.880 --> 08:07.678
so I'm trying to
get us both ready.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.588
I'm your therapist, Joan.

08:11.620 --> 08:14.680
My conﬁdentiality protects
your confidentiality.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.224
How does he feel
about you leaving?

08:18.260 --> 08:21.593
I think he's ready.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.064
I mean, he told me
to take off early this morning

08:24.100 --> 08:26.534
so that he could work
on his new case without me.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.868
You must have mixed feelings.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.700
I know how invigorating
you've found his work.

08:32.740 --> 08:35.208
You went from being a surgeon
to an addiction counselor.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.970
There's no reason you couldn't
make another change,

08:38.010 --> 08:40.274
pursue work
of a more investigative nature.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.744
Yeah-- I-I'm not interested

08:43.790 --> 08:45.781
in becoming an investigator.

08:45.820 --> 08:47.708
I like what I do right now.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.751
Well, there's the rub,
I'm afraid.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.054
Short of your client
falling off the wagon,

08:52.090 --> 08:53.955
your "right now"

08:54.000 --> 08:57.197
is coming to an end.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.790
(water flowing)

09:20.860 --> 09:24.079
*

09:33.140 --> 09:35.165
Thanks for the effort.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.805
Thanks, baby.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.035
(cheering on TV)

09:42.080 --> 09:43.377
ANNOUNCER:
Neep.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.071
So, what do you do?

09:45.110 --> 09:46.839
He's got the ball,
but he's having to work hard

09:46.880 --> 09:48.142
to keep hold of it.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.182
Owens.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.185
Before I go,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.790
you want another go?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.326
Do you mind, love?

10:04.370 --> 10:07.692
The Arsenal are playing.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.935
Here's Taylor.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.961
Throw in here.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.878
Thanks again, baby.

10:15.910 --> 10:16.899
This was fun.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.077
Now Owens.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.146
Good challenge.
(phone buzzes)

10:21.180 --> 10:22.909
ANNOUNCER 2:
Well, he's letting
the play go here.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.087
ANNOUNCER 1:
I never named a referee

10:24.120 --> 10:26.884
who tries taking advantage.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.182
ANNOUNCER 2:
Here's the shot!

10:28.220 --> 10:31.257
ANNOUNCER 1:
So Arsenal get their corner.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.929
(whistle blowing)

10:37.930 --> 10:40.990
Neep.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.234
ANNOUNCER 2:
So dangerous!

10:42.270 --> 10:43.908
ANNOUNCER 1:
Was brought here by Neep,

10:43.940 --> 10:46.204
and that's really the way
to get the ball

10:46.240 --> 10:48.834
out of the danger zone.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.841
Hey. I got your text.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.417
Meet Ian Vickers.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.918
Washed up not long ago
on Roosevelt Island.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.450
Thus narrowing
M's dump site

11:02.490 --> 11:05.186
to the entire east
side of Manhattan.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.398
My money's on
the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.193
Oil in the hair.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.834
I noticed.
There's a high

11:12.870 --> 11:15.896
concentration of industrial
engine orl around the navy yard.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.262
I donated to the cleanup effort
a couple years ago.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.270
I'm gonna miss this.

11:30.950 --> 11:34.215
Well, maybe not
this, but...

11:34.260 --> 11:35.909
this.

11:38.090 --> 11:39.489
Working with you.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.122
I think
what you do

11:41.160 --> 11:43.094
is amazing.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.098
I wanted to tell you that
at our "wrap-up dinner,"

11:45.130 --> 11:46.290
but it seems
less and less

11:46.330 --> 11:47.866
likely that's gonna happen.

11:47.900 --> 11:48.969
Anyway, I'm gonna

11:49.000 --> 11:50.331
wait outside-- just give me

11:50.370 --> 11:52.258
a five-minute warning,
and I'll call a cab.

12:00.820 --> 12:04.347
So, given that it's after 11:00,
our delivery options

12:04.390 --> 12:06.187
are a little more limited.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.188
There is that
Vietnamese place on 23rd,

12:08.220 --> 12:10.882
but I think you said it was
a front for songbird smuggling.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.319
Watson, I need you
to be very, very
quiet right now.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.123
Why?

12:15.160 --> 12:18.994
Because I believe our home
has just become a crIme scene.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.329
*

12:34.550 --> 12:35.949
GREGSON:
"Men make plans, God laughs.

12:35.980 --> 12:39.188
"I am laughing at you
now, as I always have.

12:39.220 --> 12:41.518
"You think you honor me
with your pursuit,

12:41.560 --> 12:43.027
"you do not.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.085
"You are a mouse
chasmg a lion,

12:45.130 --> 12:47.849
"a mere planet
in orbit

12:47.900 --> 12:49.299
of a raging sun."

12:49.330 --> 12:50.922
You talk to Ellis
and Hitch yet?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.892
Yeah. They were parked
out front all night

12:52.940 --> 12:54.931
and never saw anyone
come near the door.

12:54.970 --> 12:56.392
He came in the back.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.533
The lock on the rear door
was picked.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.935
Quite expertly,
I might add.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.504
I guess this answers
the question

13:01.540 --> 13:03.804
about whether he came to
New York for you, huh?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.499
My sincerest apologies, Captain.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.575
If I'd have had any notion
that my presence here

13:07.620 --> 13:09.542
would have drawn him
to your City...
Hey,

13:09.580 --> 13:12.515
hey, uh, he's the twist,
okay? Not you.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.359
You two should go
pack a few things.

13:14.390 --> 13:16.119
I'm taking you
to a safe house

13:16.160 --> 13:18.458
until all
this... M stuff

13:18.490 --> 13:20.390
gets resolved.
Captain, I hardly think

13:20.430 --> 13:22.022
that that's
necessary.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.528
Wha...? There's a psychopath
with 37 notches

13:24.570 --> 13:26.390
_in his belt that
is targeting you

13:26.430 --> 13:28.159
and was inside
your home.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.135
Look, if he wanted me dead,
he would have lain in wait,

13:31.170 --> 13:34.571
not left some
bombastic note.

13:34.610 --> 13:35.929
Holmes...

13:35.980 --> 13:36.969
He wants the game.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.147
He wants me fully engaged.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.374
That's all.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.479
If you're concerned,
feel free

13:40.520 --> 13:41.612
to leave additional security

13:41.650 --> 13:43.311
at the back of the building.

13:43.350 --> 13:46.217
But I assure you,
I am safe as houses here.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.514
I guess that leaves you,
Miss Watson.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.289
I'm staying.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.355
I go where he goes, remember?

13:54.630 --> 13:56.222
WATSON:
Thank you very much.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.262
Good night.

14:06.070 --> 14:08.277
I'm heading to bed.

14:10.410 --> 14:11.502
What's all that?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.142
Oh, it's another

14:13.180 --> 14:15.614
of my father's
properties. I'm...

14:15.650 --> 14:17.948
thinking of moving
when you and I part ways.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.548
Since when?

14:19.590 --> 14:20.909
Since our humble home

14:20.960 --> 14:23.155
was penetrated so easily
by a madman.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.579
But you told Captain Gregson
you weren't worried.

14:25.630 --> 14:26.585
I'm not.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.222
I'm just thinking ahead.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.898
My enemies are legion.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.488
The next one might leave more

14:31.530 --> 14:33.236
than just a note.

14:33.270 --> 14:37.001
So much for the giant apiary
in my bedroom.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.565
Everyone else is gone,
correct? It's just us?

14:39.610 --> 14:40.634
Just us.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.614
*

15:09.440 --> 15:12.409
*

15:37.600 --> 15:40.194
Yo, man, I got these
knockoff Gucci shades--

15:40.240 --> 15:42.299
20 bucks,
and they're yours.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.069
No, thanks.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.737
BOY: All right,
too Euro-trash?
I got more

15:45.770 --> 15:47.306
of an American
feel for you.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.604
I got some movies.
I got all the new releases.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.505
Even got a couple
Oscar bait in here.
Back off.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.274
Come on, man,

15:54.320 --> 15:55.742
could you just
check it out
for me, please?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.008
I said back off!

16:01.090 --> 16:03.354
Yo, dawg, you just
broke my phone.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.654
Yeah, that's right,
you bett run.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.592
*

16:14.800 --> 16:17.360
(doorbell rings)

16:19.740 --> 16:21.708
Sorry to bother you.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.674
He was making his way
up to your stoop.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.746
Claims to be a friend
of Mr. Holmes.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.578
You know him?
I don't. And Sherlock
isn't here at the moment.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.679
Look, Holmes told
me to text him,
but I couldn't

16:30.720 --> 16:32.779
'cause I broke my phone.
That's the only
reason I'm here.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.015
Say the word,
and we'll send him on his way.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.379
You a friend of his?

16:36.420 --> 16:38.650
Associate.
He doesn't have
any friends.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.726
It's okay, he can stay.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.491
Captain said stop
anyone and everyone.
Black?

16:44.530 --> 16:47.192
You know, if I need you,
I will use the radio

16:47.240 --> 16:48.662
that Detective Bell left for me.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.736
(quietly):
All right.

16:50.770 --> 16:51.759
Thank you.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.111
Are you a hooker?

17:01.150 --> 17:02.617
No.

17:02.650 --> 17:03.810
Hmm.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.818
I know how
Holmes rolls.

17:05.850 --> 17:07.818
Right. 'Cause you're
his associate.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.781
Mm-hmm.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.158
Hey... I've
never actually

17:13.200 --> 17:15.191
been inside this place.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.660
So, how do you know Sherlock?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.634
A while back, me and a buddy

17:20.670 --> 17:22.797
were scamming
on Washington Square Park.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.662
I'd chat the folks up,
Levon'd steal their wallets.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.178
No one made us
except for Holmes.

17:29.210 --> 17:31.144
He told us to give
the stuff back.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.704
But he didn't
turn us in.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.615
Now he just uses us sometimes.

17:34.650 --> 17:36.174
What do you mean
he uses you?

17:36.220 --> 17:38.518
Little earlier he came up
to me and a few of my boys

17:38.550 --> 17:40.780
and told us to check out a few
hotels, look for this guy.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.186
Said he had a few hundred
for whoever could find him.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.154
And I found him--
so I'm here to collect.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.693
If this is who I think it is,
he's dangerous.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.869
You shouldn't
have been near him.
Yeah, Holmes

17:50.900 --> 17:52.765
warned us about sticking
to the public places.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.530
I followed him, even
got him to talk to me,

17:55.570 --> 17:57.868
so I could be sure it was him.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.539
He's a Brit, just
like Holmes said.

18:09.150 --> 18:12.085
Uh, yo.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.783
Is he gonna
be here soon?

18:15.820 --> 18:17.481
'Cause I need to get paid.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.735
Care to explain this?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.736
I got it

18:36.780 --> 18:38.145
from a friend of yours-- Teddy.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.817
No?

18:40.850 --> 18:42.841
What about this?

18:43.820 --> 18:44.684
I took a look
around the house

18:44.720 --> 18:46.779
while you were out.
I found three others

18:46.820 --> 18:48.310
just like it.
I can only imagine

18:48.360 --> 18:49.657
how many I didn't find.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.351
That's funny, when
I moved in here,

18:51.390 --> 18:52.721
you didn't mention anything
about your little,

18:52.760 --> 18:55.354
uh... surveillance system.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.698
This is my sanctum sanctorum.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.733
Did you honestly believe there
wouldn't be security measures?

19:00.770 --> 19:02.931
Okay.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.461
Is that M?

19:05.510 --> 19:08.229
You told a bunch of children
to go to upscale hotels

19:08.280 --> 19:10.475
to look for him. Why?

19:15.520 --> 19:17.488
Note the hands.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.647
Vintage MG driving gloves--
quite expensive.

19:19.690 --> 19:22.716
But not nearly as expensive
as his John Varvatos shoes.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.387
M has money.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.829
That much is obvious.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.828
He's also a recent migr
to New York.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.624
Why did I assume that
he would be in a hotel

19:30.670 --> 19:32.490
as opposed to a property
he might own?

19:32.530 --> 19:33.895
Well, it's quite simple.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.589
I noted a curious scent

19:35.640 --> 19:37.437
on the note that he left.

19:37.470 --> 19:38.402
I quickly realized

19:38.440 --> 19:39.600
it was, in fact,

19:39.640 --> 19:40.971
a combination of scents.

19:41.010 --> 19:44.343
Those of the high-end
hand soap and an even

19:44.380 --> 19:46.348
higher-end mint-based shampoo.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.213
Each product is used
by various upscale hotels

19:49.250 --> 19:51.389
around the city,
but only one chain,

19:51.420 --> 19:53.479
the Betancourt, stocks both.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.488
My lieutenants and I

19:55.520 --> 19:57.852
each took a Betancourt,
and watched for M.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.324
That's all very impressive,
but I want to know

20:00.360 --> 20:02.624
why you shared a photo
of a wanted serial killer

20:02.660 --> 20:04.764
with a bunch of kids
instead of going

20:04.800 --> 20:07.189
to the NYPD.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.537
Several weeks ago, you
learned of the existence

20:14.580 --> 20:16.468
of a woman named
Irene Adler.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.501
I told you she'd died.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.018
M killed her.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.484
Obviously, he realized
the degree to which
I was assisting

20:23.520 --> 20:25.511
the British police in
their hunt to find him.

20:25.550 --> 20:29.782
He zeroed in on me,
made things personal.

20:29.820 --> 20:32.527
As to why I am withholding
information from the NYPD,

20:32.560 --> 20:35.529
it's quite simple:
I have no intention

20:35.560 --> 20:37.528
of capturing M.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.891
I have every intention
of torturing...

20:39.930 --> 20:41.932
and murdering him.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.649
What do you mean you plan
to torture and murder M?

20:51.680 --> 20:53.978
Hard to imagine I could have
been much clearer, Watson.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.715
Hey, this
isn't a joke.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.684
No. This is revenge.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.745
Wait, how are
you so calm?

20:59.790 --> 21:02.611
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.457
I'm not calm.

21:04.490 --> 21:06.458
I'm merely presenting
a calm exterior.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.458
Inside, I am roiling.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.468
I've been dreaming
about this moment

21:10.500 --> 21:12.968
quite some time:
one year, six months,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.036
22 days, to be exact.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.038
That's when he killed her.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.867
WATSON:
Irene.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.732
We'd been together
seven months by then.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.749
I won't bore you with
the details of our courtship.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.873
Suffice it to say...

21:27.920 --> 21:29.615
I was quite smitten.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.641
Up until that point in my life,

21:31.690 --> 21:33.578
I'd found most women
qUIte boring--

21:33.620 --> 21:37.454
a perfumed and
pillowy means to
a physiological end.

21:37.490 --> 21:38.752
Irene was different.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.348
You were in love.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.824
Prior to her murder,
my drug use had been...

21:45.870 --> 21:47.098
recreational.

21:47.130 --> 21:48.961
Something to do
when I was bored

21:49.000 --> 21:51.901
or in need of a boost
during a particularly

21:51.940 --> 21:53.669
challenging investigation.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.429
After Irene,
well, I lost control.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.675
I used... various stimulants

21:58.710 --> 22:02.669
as I tried to help
the authorities identify M.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.382
On_ce went several weeks
Without sleeping. Yeah.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.581
When the trail
finally went cold,

22:07.620 --> 22:09.611
I turned to opiates.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.355
Look, I'm grateful
to know the whole story,

22:11.390 --> 22:12.823
but you've come
a long way since London.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.589
I'm not gonna let you

22:14.630 --> 22:16.621
risk it all by chasing
down a psychopath.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.026
You know, I don't think
you understand, Watson.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.868
Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.936
Everything that you've helped me
do these past six weeks--

22:23.970 --> 22:25.665
every-every meeting
you've dragged me to,

22:25.710 --> 22:27.769
every exercise
you've compelled me to perform--

22:27.810 --> 22:29.835
it's all been in preparation
for this moment.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.677
I'm not throwing away
anything I've learned.

22:31.710 --> 22:33.712
I'm using it.

22:33.750 --> 22:37.447
I am as clearheaded and
as focused as I have ever been.

22:37.490 --> 22:40.584
There's a clarity
to my thinking that's...

22:40.620 --> 22:42.451
frightening.

22:42.490 --> 22:45.129
I didn't help you stay sober
so you could become a murderer.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.720
Well, you didn't realize
that's what you were doing.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.728
Nor did I.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.489
Not until I walked in

22:51.530 --> 22:53.066
on that crime scene
the other day.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.762
I saw M's handiwork.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.506
_ I realized I'd been
given a second chance.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.565
Is that why you didn't
want me to help you

22:59.610 --> 23:00.770
with the M files
the other day?

23:00.810 --> 23:01.936
Because you knew
I'd see Irene's name

23:01.980 --> 23:03.572
and realize you were
up to something?

23:03.610 --> 23:05.840
I was the only one who
could make that connection.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.677
I'd hoped we would never have
to have this conversation.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.039
I don't want you feeling
responsible for something

23:09.080 --> 23:10.889
that I have to do.
You lied to me

23:10.920 --> 23:12.808
because you know what you're
planning to do is wrong.

23:12.850 --> 23:13.885
If you were considering
following me,

23:13.920 --> 23:16.013
I strongly advise against it.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.425
I'm not gonna follow you.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.189
But you know

23:19.230 --> 23:21.551
that I'm gonna have to
call Captain Gregson.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.568
You do as you feel
you must, Watson.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.591
I'll do the same.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.632
(rap music playing
over headphones)

23:33.840 --> 23:34.875
VVhoa!

23:34.910 --> 23:37.549
Theodore.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.707
Heard you met another
of my associates today.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.547
She said you had
something for me.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.740
That depends.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.589
You got something
for me?

23:44.620 --> 23:45.780
Right.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.857
Now, tell me everything
you saw today.

23:48.890 --> 23:50.881
WOMAN (over television):
Pizzas come savory
and they come sweet.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.182
With the pizza dough you can do
a lot of different things.

23:53.230 --> 23:56.028
First thing I want to do
is melt some butter.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.891
So I'm going to brush
the pizza dough...

23:57.930 --> 23:59.067
(growls)

23:59.100 --> 24:01.534
...just to give it
a little bit of a...

24:01.570 --> 24:02.935
(barking)

24:04.110 --> 24:05.702
(growls, barks)

24:05.740 --> 24:07.776
What is it?
(barking in distance)

24:07.810 --> 24:10.938
Flour the board a little bit
so the dough doesn't stick,

24:10.980 --> 24:12.174
flour your rolling pin...

24:12.210 --> 24:14.212
Bavaro, you okay?

24:23.890 --> 24:26.029
(chewing)

24:29.560 --> 24:31.699
Where the heck did you get that?

24:38.910 --> 24:42.129
(muffled screaming)

24:42.180 --> 24:43.704
(phone beeping loudly)

24:43.750 --> 24:45.809
GREGSON:
Son of a bitch.

24:45.850 --> 24:47.272
I am pissed.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.971
I get revenge.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.285
I've lost friends
on the job to scumbags.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.719
Believe me,
there's been more

24:53.760 --> 24:54.818
than a few times I thought about

24:54.860 --> 24:56.851
taking things into my own hands.

24:56.890 --> 24:58.858
But I didn't. Now,
he may not be a cop,

24:58.890 --> 25:01.552
but he's been
around law enforcement

25:01.600 --> 25:02.953
long enough
to know that.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.820
This Teddy kid.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.292
What did he say
about the killer?

25:06.330 --> 25:08.662
Just that he was staying
at an upscale hotel.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.032
Sherlock deduced that it was,
uh, the Betancourt chain.

25:11.070 --> 25:13.607
I'm gonna have my guys go to
all the Betancourt hotels,

25:13.640 --> 25:15.107
see if we can't
scoop him up.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.700
I don't think M is the only one
we need to be looking for.

25:19.180 --> 25:22.946
If he isn't at his hotel,
Sherlock may already have him.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.017
ANNOUNCER:
Arsenal looking a bit ragged now
as play continues.

25:26.050 --> 25:28.018
Santiago moving right.
The young Spaniard

25:28.060 --> 25:30.278
looking good here in his first
match. Taylor tracking back

25:30.320 --> 25:31.958
through midfield,
nipping at his heels.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.821
Oh, and a hard tackle
from Taylor.

25:33.860 --> 25:34.997
Looks like Browns is reaching

25:35.030 --> 25:36.952
for his pocket.
Yes, a yellow card here

25:37.000 --> 25:39.662
for Taylor in the 70th minute.
That'll certainly make things

25:39.700 --> 25:40.997
interesting for the Gunners
as they cling

25:41.040 --> 25:42.837
to a tenuous one-nil lead.

25:42.870 --> 25:45.304
That's a joke.
He hardly touched him.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.308
HOLMES:
Arsenal fan.

25:47.340 --> 25:50.002
As if I didn't have enough
reasons to despise you.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.268
You.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.675
Me.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.712
Baton.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.921
(buzzing)

26:12.070 --> 26:12.991
(grunting)

26:23.850 --> 26:25.647
I hope you don't mind being

26:25.680 --> 26:27.716
hung right-side up--
I know you prefer the opposite

26:27.750 --> 26:29.012
for your victims.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.115
You figured out
where you're gonna start yet?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.788
I have not.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.991
I had hoped
to use the...

26:42.030 --> 26:44.897
bees in some fashion,
but then it occurred to me

26:44.930 --> 26:47.091
you might be allergic.

26:47.130 --> 26:50.190
After all this trouble, I'd hate
for our fun to be over too soon.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.061
That would be a pity.

26:53.110 --> 26:55.408
Bit surprised at you, though.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.841
I thought you as more
of a by-the-book kind of bloke.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.917
So, why here, huh?

27:01.950 --> 27:03.611
Why not take me straight
to the nick?

27:04.850 --> 27:07.148
I think you know why.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.987
I think I don't.

27:09.020 --> 27:12.126
Irene.

27:15.060 --> 27:17.028
Pretending the name
isn't familiar to you

27:17.060 --> 27:19.369
will not make things
any easier for you.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.937
(buzzing continues)

27:21.970 --> 27:24.165
Addison?

27:30.410 --> 27:32.901
Adler.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.839
Irene Adler.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.211
(laughs)

27:37.250 --> 27:39.138
Got killed
in her flat,

27:39.190 --> 27:42.387
Camden Lock,
about a year and a half ago.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.957
(laughs)

27:44.990 --> 27:48.118
Sorry to disappoint you,
mate, but it wasn't me.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.065
It was probably
the other blood-draining madman

27:52.100 --> 27:55.160
with the tripod device, hmm?

27:55.200 --> 27:57.737
I was banged up in Brixton
for six months.

27:57.770 --> 27:59.260
Not for the killing,
of course.

27:59.310 --> 28:02.006
I had a misunderstanding
with a Man United fan.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.975
He was running around
slagging off the Arsenal.

28:05.010 --> 28:06.807
Didn't paralyze him.
I just

28:06.850 --> 28:08.442
bashed him up a bit.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.040
And while I was
doing the stretch,

28:11.090 --> 28:15.857
read in the papers that the
notorious "M" had struck again.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.482
Imagine my surprise.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.125
But you disappoint me.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.095
And Scotland Yard, of course.

28:23.130 --> 28:25.860
Falling for that copycat
so easily?

28:27.770 --> 28:31.069
(laughs)

28:31.110 --> 28:35.103
Tell me. You and Miss Adler

28:35.140 --> 28:37.176
an item?

28:37.210 --> 28:39.178
I have to say, I'm a little
disappointed in you.

28:39.210 --> 28:40.746
I thought you'd be
a much better liar.

28:40.780 --> 28:41.872
I'm not lying.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.478
Well, why would you

28:43.520 --> 28:46.080
when facing an agonizing death?

28:46.120 --> 28:48.486
Ex-Royal Marine.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.056
Death's an old friend.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.455
Is he?

28:51.490 --> 28:54.527
What about torture?

28:54.560 --> 28:56.221
Is he an old friend, too?

28:58.500 --> 29:01.799
You made me a shambles of a man.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.206
Now I'm simply
returning the favor.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.231
(sighs)

29:06.270 --> 29:07.202
(grunts)

29:07.240 --> 29:09.970
I was on the floor.

29:10.010 --> 29:11.841
I was screaming,

29:11.880 --> 29:15.247
but the tape was so tight
around my mouth, I cou...

29:15.280 --> 29:18.078
Oh, oh.
I couldn't...

29:18.120 --> 29:20.111
It's okay.
It's okay, Ms. Cullen.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.254
Take your time.

29:22.290 --> 29:25.088
That's when I saw
the second man's feet.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.121
He walked right by me.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.821
Did you get a look at his face?

29:28.860 --> 29:30.964
Um...

29:31.000 --> 29:34.231
He said something
to the man who tied me up,

29:34.270 --> 29:40.106
but I-I couldn't hear them over
the TV, but then after a minute,

29:40.140 --> 29:43.200
the second man came back
into the hall.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.209
He said he would cut me free.

29:46.250 --> 29:49.139
He said he didn't want me
to turn around.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.410
And he said
I should wait ten minutes

29:51.450 --> 29:54.886
and then call the police.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.808
He
even said "P
, lease."

29:56.860 --> 29:58.885
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Klein. Paging Dr. Klein.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.283
Did he have
an accent?

30:00.330 --> 30:01.592
I think he was British.

30:01.630 --> 30:05.418
I think the first man
was British, too.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.030
He was watching
a British soccer game...

30:08.070 --> 30:10.368
on my TV.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.200
Do you remember any other
details about either man?

30:14.240 --> 30:16.435
The second one,

30:16.480 --> 30:18.141
the one that set me free--

30:18.180 --> 30:20.148
he had some sort of chalk

30:20.180 --> 30:22.216
on his shoes.
Chalk?

30:22.250 --> 30:24.445
Powder.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.548
It was white.

30:25.590 --> 30:28.013
Miss Cullen?

30:28.060 --> 30:31.325
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse us.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.295
Last night
he was looking at photos

30:35.330 --> 30:36.524
of one of his father's

30:36.560 --> 30:38.027
other properties in New York.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.389
He said
he was thinking about moving.

30:39.430 --> 30:41.193
But maybe he was looking
for a place

30:41.240 --> 30:43.037
to take M after he found him.

30:43.070 --> 30:45.106
Well, what makes you think
that would be the place?

30:45.140 --> 30:47.028
It was being renovated. There
was white powder everywhere.

30:47.070 --> 30:48.230
Do you have an address?

30:48.280 --> 30:50.236
No.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.101
I think I know
how we can find one.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.139
(grunting)

30:58.250 --> 30:59.581
(laughing)

31:05.290 --> 31:08.293
Anybody ever tell you
you punch like a woman?

31:08.330 --> 31:09.649
Yeah, a woman did once.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.429
But she was much bigger than me.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.938
And the abductor of young girls

31:13.970 --> 31:17.929
that she used to turn a profit
in the sex trade, 50...

31:17.970 --> 31:21.337
Well, for a ponce,
you move pretty quick.

31:21.380 --> 31:25.168
What, I dropped my first body
here, what, 72 hours ago?

31:25.210 --> 31:26.973
What'd you do,
jump on a plane?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.274
Where am I supposed
to have flown in from?

31:29.320 --> 31:32.448
Uh... London?

31:32.490 --> 31:34.651
What makes you think
I'd gone back there?

31:34.690 --> 31:36.578
What are you talking about,
"gone back"?

31:36.620 --> 31:38.349
You trying to tell me
you live here now?

31:38.390 --> 31:40.051
You know I live here.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.955
You were in my home
the other night.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.525
You left a note.
That's how I found you.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.368
That was your place?

31:48.400 --> 31:51.039
You don't look well, M.

31:51.070 --> 31:54.130
You-You don't mind
ifI call you M, do you?

31:54.180 --> 31:57.274
Something's not right.

31:57.310 --> 32:01.110
I'm not what you think I am.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.983
I'm not a serial killer.
I'm an assassm.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.385
I have an employer.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.287
Listen...

32:08.320 --> 32:10.709
I received the names of everyone
I killed for him.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.557
He pays me.

32:12.590 --> 32:16.390
I already told you you're
a terrible liar, didn't I?

32:16.430 --> 32:18.421
I'm not lying.

32:20.670 --> 32:23.639
He sold me out.

32:23.670 --> 32:26.059
He never told me you was here.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.168
Who didn't?

32:27.210 --> 32:28.404
My employer.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.000
The MOs, the notes,

32:31.050 --> 32:34.144
all that "serial killer"
bollocks! That was him!

32:34.180 --> 32:36.319
Let's pretend
that I believe you.

32:36.350 --> 32:40.081
What was his motive
for killing 37 people?

32:40.120 --> 32:44.420
I don't know.
I never met him.

32:44.460 --> 32:48.351
He sends me coded message
on my cell phone.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.755
It's there in my jacket.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.223
Have a look
if you don't believe me.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.206
Gobbledygook.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.501
Proves nothing.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.576
Sebastian Moran--
that's my real name.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.384
Look it up!

33:11.420 --> 33:13.513
The fight I was in--
there was a trial,

33:13.550 --> 33:15.518
it was in the papers.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.187
I couldn't have hurt
your girl.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.426
You'll see
I'm telling the truth.

33:18.460 --> 33:21.497
He always
talked about you.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.464
Must have been

33:24.500 --> 33:25.467
obsessed or something.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.398
Had a fascination.

33:26.430 --> 33:28.068
He never told me you was here,

33:28.100 --> 33:29.431
and he sure as hell
never told me

33:29.470 --> 33:31.404
that was your apartment
I broke into.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.307
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's the one that killed your

33:34.340 --> 33:35.409
precious Irene.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.408
No.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.078
Don't let him play you as well.

33:39.110 --> 33:40.202
No.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.569
It's you.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.110
Has to be.

33:43.150 --> 33:45.118
Listen.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.708
You can kill me
for all the others,

33:46.750 --> 33:48.479
but your girl...

33:48.520 --> 33:51.455
that was him.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.481
That was Moriarty.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.493
Just heard
from the Buildings Department,

33:58.530 --> 34:00.259
and they said
that Holmes' dad's company

34:00.300 --> 34:01.597
applied for a remodeling permit

34:01.640 --> 34:04.302
about six months ago
on a loft in Brooklyn.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.409
The address is

34:05.440 --> 34:07.135
3203 North Sixth Street.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.331
They got any other building
permits out at the moment?

34:09.380 --> 34:10.369
No.
Well, then,

34:10.410 --> 34:11.638
let's assume that's the one

34:11.680 --> 34:12.647
we're looking for.

34:12.680 --> 34:14.443
Tell ESU to meet me there.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.074
Moriarty's who you want, not me.

34:18.850 --> 34:22.411
I seem to recall you saying
you were not afraid to die.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.520
It's not fear
I'm feeling right now.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.528
It's anger.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.324
Righteous anger.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.090
Moriarty sold me out,
and I'm gonna get even.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.337
You're a monster.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.531
A sadist.

34:37.570 --> 34:39.561
A murderer.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.547
All of those...

34:44.580 --> 34:45.740
but I'm not

34:45.780 --> 34:47.543
a liar.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.673
Reach out
to Brixton Prison,

34:49.720 --> 34:52.587
they'll tell you
that I was locked up

34:52.620 --> 34:54.383
when Irene was killed.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.580
No.

34:55.620 --> 34:58.555
_I couldn't have been
in two places at once.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.729
Look at me, Holmes.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.422
I'm telling the truth.
You killed her.

35:03.460 --> 35:04.620
I never touched
a hair on her head!

35:04.670 --> 35:05.659
You killed her.

35:07.470 --> 35:11.531
(panﬁng)

35:11.570 --> 35:15.131
Moriarty said you was
obsessed with puzzles.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.809
But he's greatest puzzle
you'll ever come across.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.670
You kill me now,

35:20.710 --> 35:25.579
and you'll be killing
the best clue you ever had.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.479
(sighs)

35:33.490 --> 35:37.494
I knew you'd make
the right decision.

35:37.530 --> 35:41.364
You're a rare thing
in this world, Holmes.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.698
You're an honorable man.

35:43.740 --> 35:46.504
A famous statistician
once stated

35:46.540 --> 35:49.407
that_ while the individual man
is an insoluble puzzle,

35:49.440 --> 35:52.705
in the aggregate he becomes
a mathematical certainty.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.344
You can,
for example,

35:55.380 --> 35:57.314
never foretell _
what any one man Will do.

35:57.350 --> 35:58.715
But you can, with precision,

35:58.750 --> 36:02.151
say what an average man will do.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.682
Individuals vary,

36:04.730 --> 36:07.255
percentages remain constant.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.952
So says the
statistician.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.263
(M screams)

36:20.670 --> 36:22.900
Stay here.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.306
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:27.910 --> 36:31.641
Holmes! If you're in here, get
down on the ground right now!

36:31.690 --> 36:33.487
OFFICER:
Clear!

36:33.520 --> 36:34.555
OFFICER:
Clear!

36:34.590 --> 36:36.285
(phone rings)

36:36.320 --> 36:38.459
Yeah.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.720
Are you kidding me?

36:40.760 --> 36:41.727
Were we too late?

36:41.760 --> 36:42.727
Yeah, we were.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.660
Just got a call from Bell.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.725
Holmes just walked into the
station five minutes ago...

36:46.770 --> 36:48.761
with M.

36:50.470 --> 36:54.531
For the last time, mate,
Holmes did not abduct me.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.775
I lured him
to Miss Cullen's place,

36:56.810 --> 37:00.644
and then he followed me
to that loft.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.910
A loft just happened to
be owned by his father?

37:02.950 --> 37:04.918
Yeah, I was aware of that.

37:04.950 --> 37:08.989
I just thought it'd be pretty
cool if they found Holmes' body

37:09.020 --> 37:10.749
at his father's property.

37:10.790 --> 37:12.826
BE_LL: _ _ _
Can you explain your injuries

37:12.860 --> 37:14.418
one more time?

37:14.460 --> 37:15.688
(M sighs)

37:15.730 --> 37:17.721
I went at him.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.558
He defended himself.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.465
It's as simple as that.

37:22.500 --> 37:23.990
He stabbed you.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.837
Eventually, yeah.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.758
Miracle, really.

37:27.810 --> 37:30.404
He missed every major organ,

37:30.440 --> 37:32.704
according to the doc that looked
me over in the cell.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.671
Luclq.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.610
What can I say?

37:35.650 --> 37:38.289
I've led a charmed life.

37:47.790 --> 37:51.362
You're missing out
on quite a story back there.

37:56.370 --> 37:57.928
The stab wound
he sustained?

37:57.970 --> 37:59.733
He claims he got it
in a struggle,

37:59.770 --> 38:01.032
but I'm pretty sure if he had,

38:01.070 --> 38:04.039
there would've
been more damage.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.974
Looks more like he was
stationary.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.318
Maybe even restrained.

38:11.350 --> 38:13.545
I used to be
a surgeon.

38:13.590 --> 38:15.683
I don't know if I could've found
a way to stab a man

38:15.720 --> 38:17.654
without actually doing
any real harm.

38:17.690 --> 38:19.954
If that's what
you meant

38:19.990 --> 38:23.756
to do, I'm impressed.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.893
If you're trying to make
some sort of point...

38:25.930 --> 38:27.591
He presumed to know me

38:27.630 --> 38:31.600
and he needed to be shown
that he did not.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.733
He says he's willing to confess
to all the murders,

38:33.770 --> 38:34.976
but he won't give you up.

38:35.010 --> 38:39.845
He believes that
he's been wronged.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.643
He thinks
I'm the best chance he has

38:41.680 --> 38:45.013
at bringing whoever wronged him
to justice.

38:45.050 --> 38:46.688
Are you planning on helping him?

38:49.020 --> 38:51.750
He killed Irene.

38:51.790 --> 38:55.021
No.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.528
As it turns out, he did not.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.425
_ He was
incarcerated

38:59.470 --> 39:01.688
at the time she died.

39:01.740 --> 39:05.528
I confirmed it
a short while ago.

39:10.980 --> 39:13.801
I'm sorry that I lied
to you, Watson.

39:15.780 --> 39:19.716
The last few days have been
quite... vexing.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.456
Even now, I'm
not certain

39:21.490 --> 39:24.789
if I've done the right thing
in allowing M to live.

39:24.830 --> 39:28.391
It's strange,
really.

39:28.430 --> 39:31.524
I'm rarely conflicted
about the decisions I make.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.131
That's the beauty of deductive
reasoning, I suppose.

39:35.170 --> 39:39.709
It makes a science
of almost everything.

39:44.580 --> 39:46.502
Not this.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.707
I'm gonna miss this.

40:16.810 --> 40:19.677
(stammering)

40:19.710 --> 40:24.613
Maybe not this so much.

40:24.650 --> 40:28.984
But this.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.113
Working with you.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.191
I think what you do is amazing.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.961
I'm sorry our last days together
had to go so poorly.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.204
(door shuts)

40:57.950 --> 41:02.011
Hi, this is Joan Watson calling
from New York.

41:02.060 --> 41:05.928
Is Mr. Holmes available?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.484
Okay.

41:08.600 --> 41:12.627
Can you just tell him...

41:12.670 --> 41:13.796
I'm worried about his son

41:13.830 --> 41:16.560
and I'd like to stay on
a bit longer?

41:23.540 --> 41:25.178
(text alert sounds)

41:40.260 --> 41:42.296
Watson, what is it?

41:42.330 --> 41:46.699
Um, I called your
father last night.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.027
Given everything
that's happened,

41:48.070 --> 41:49.958
_I recommended
staying on a while longer.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.537
And?

41:52.570 --> 41:54.538
He agreed.

41:54.580 --> 41:59.005
I suppose the apiary will have
to wait.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.079
