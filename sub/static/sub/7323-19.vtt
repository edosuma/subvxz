WEBVTT

00:02.673 --> 00:05.176
(Meredith) AFTER A TRAUMA

00:05.176 --> 00:08.539
YOUR BODY
IS AT ITS MOST VULNERABLE.

00:08.539 --> 00:10.641
RESPONSE TIME IS CRITICAL.

00:10.641 --> 00:12.613
(Little Red's "Slow Motion"
playing)

00:12.613 --> 00:14.615
SO YOU'RE SUDDENLY
SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE...

00:14.615 --> 00:16.617
GO. GO.
YOU GOT IT.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.150
DOCTORS, NURSES...
FOCUS. FOCUS.

00:19.150 --> 00:21.122
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
SPECIALISTS, TECHNICIANS.

00:21.122 --> 00:24.225
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH. GO.
SURGERY IS A TEAM SPORT...

00:24.225 --> 00:26.657
(Cristina and Arizona
talking over each other)
EVERYONE PUSHING
FOR THE FINISH LINE...

00:26.657 --> 00:28.559
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
GOOD JOB.
YAY, FINGERS.

00:28.559 --> 00:31.562
YEAH. YEAH.
PUTTING YOU
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.164
(pants) OOH.

00:33.164 --> 00:36.367
(Miranda) OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.239
YOU'RE RETRAINING YOUR BRAIN.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.641
GETTING YOUR FINGERS STRAIGHT
WAS THE GOAL FOR TODAY, OKAY?
MM-HMM.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.243
LITTLE GOALS, REMEMBER?

00:42.243 --> 00:45.416
ALL RIGHT, LET ME GET IN THERE
TO CHECK HER INCISION.

00:45.416 --> 00:47.548
GOOD MORNING.
BABY REPORT. BOOM.
I'M GONNA GO SEE HER.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.720
HEY. YOU'RE AWESOME.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.483
OH, GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.
SEE? SHE'S MOVING HER ARM
LIKE SHE'S WAVING.

00:52.483 --> 00:54.485
SHE STILL DOESN'T OPEN
HER EYES,

00:54.485 --> 00:57.228
BUT SHE ONLY STOPPED BREATHING
ONCE LAST NIGHT. AND GET THIS--

00:57.228 --> 00:59.590
HER BRAIN BLEED'S
STILL GRADE 1.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.392
(gasps) GOOD GIRL.

01:01.392 --> 01:04.395
SHE LOOKS BIGGER.

01:04.395 --> 01:06.137
IS SHE BIGGER?

01:06.137 --> 01:09.800
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.
SOME OF US ARE STILL WORKING.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.743
LET ME GET IN THERE, PLEASE.
(Mark) OKAY, I HAVE A CONSULT.
I HAVE TO GO.

01:12.743 --> 01:14.405
HOW ARE YOU?

01:14.405 --> 01:18.379
UM... I ALMOST
GOT MY HAND STRAIGHT.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.111
THAT'S GREAT.
MM-HMM. YEAH.

01:20.111 --> 01:21.652
YEAH.

01:21.652 --> 01:24.215
BUT SURGERY IS A TRAUMA
IN AND OF ITSELF.

01:24.215 --> 01:27.618
SO TODAY?
I CAN SEE HER TODAY?

01:27.618 --> 01:31.091
AND ONCE IT'S OVER,
THE REAL HEALING BEGINS.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.364
WE CALL IT RECOVERY.
I'M SORRY.

01:33.364 --> 01:35.095
NO.
BUT UNTIL...

01:35.095 --> 01:36.367
NO.

01:36.367 --> 01:38.129
YOU CAN BE MOBILIZED

01:38.129 --> 01:40.131
AND YOUR INFECTIONS
ARE COMPLETELY GONE,

01:40.131 --> 01:41.832
YOU CANNOT SEE HER,

01:41.832 --> 01:44.635
AND SHE CANNOT LEAVE
THE NICU.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.507
(sobs)
NOW YOU KNOW

01:46.507 --> 01:48.539
I WOULD IF I COULD.
MM. MM-HMM.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.541
RIGHT? YOU KNOW THAT, RI--

01:50.541 --> 01:52.683
RECOVERY IS NOT
A TEAM SPORT.

01:52.683 --> 01:54.185
YANG.

01:54.185 --> 01:56.187
MM-HMM.
TELL HER I WOULD.

01:56.187 --> 01:58.789
MM-HMM. SHE WOULD
IFSHE COULD.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.392
IT'S A SOLITARY DISTANCE RUN.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.394
ARE YOU GIVING ME
THE FINGER?

02:03.394 --> 02:05.196
YES, I AM.

02:05.196 --> 02:06.827
GOOD JOB.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.159
(laughs)

02:08.159 --> 02:10.130
IT'S LONG, IT'S EXHAUSTING...

02:10.130 --> 02:12.603
♪ WHEN I SEE YOU,
I CAN JUST STARE ♪

02:12.603 --> 02:14.605
AND IT'S LONELY AS HELL.

02:14.605 --> 02:16.607
♪ FOR A MOMENT,
CAUGHT HANGING IN MIDAIR ♪

02:16.607 --> 02:19.810
(sighs)

02:19.810 --> 02:22.443
(Owen) MRS. PULCHER, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO STOP SMOKING.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.446
YOUR INFECTIONS
ARE GETTING WORSE.
YOUR INFECTIONS, YOU MEAN.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.449
I DIDN'T HAVE THEM BEFORE
YOU TWO IDIOTS OPERATED.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.451
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
DO THAT RIGHT.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.453
AGAIN, I AM SORRY,
BUT YOUR LUNG CANCER

02:32.453 --> 02:35.686
HAD SPREAD TO THE POINT
THAT WE COULDN'T--
PLEASE. USELESS.

02:35.686 --> 02:38.329
I CAN AFFORD ANY HOSPITAL
IN THE WORLD,

02:38.329 --> 02:41.262
AND I COME TO THIS THIRD-RATE
CRAP FACTORY.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.794
WHEN AM I GETTING OUTTA HERE?
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE WEEKS.

02:43.794 --> 02:47.268
THIS IS NOT GUANTáNAMO.
(lowered voice) DISCHARGE HER,
PLEASE. I'LL PAY YOU.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.270
THERE IS NOT MUCH MORE
THAT WE CAN DO

02:49.270 --> 02:51.742
UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP
YOURSELF. NOW THE SMOKING--

02:51.742 --> 02:53.844
OH, IF I WANTED A LECTURE
ON SMOKING,

02:53.844 --> 02:55.846
I'D DIG UP MY DEAD HUSBAND.

02:55.846 --> 02:59.250
NOW GET ME OUTTA HERE
BEFORE I SUE YOUR BALLS OFF.
WELL, WE'LL RUN SOME TESTS,

02:59.250 --> 03:01.312
AND IF
YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNT

03:01.312 --> 03:05.486
IS UP TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL--
HOW HIGH
DOES IT HAVE TO BE?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.187
GIVE ME A NUMBER.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.690
WELL, IT'S AT A .8 NOW,
AND I'D LIKE IT TO BE ABOVE A 2.
1.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.492
THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.325
EVERYTHING IS. 1.5.

03:14.325 --> 03:16.867
1.5
AND YOU LET ME OUTTA HERE.

03:16.867 --> 03:18.769
NOW GET ME A WHEELCHAIR,

03:18.769 --> 03:21.332
'CAUSE IF I HAVE TO
WAIT AROUND THIS HELLHOLE,

03:21.332 --> 03:23.904
I'M GONNA SMOKE.
OKAY.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.437
(clears throat)

03:26.437 --> 03:27.838
(elevator bell dings)

03:27.838 --> 03:29.740
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:29.740 --> 03:32.743
OOH. I SMOOTHED OUT SOME BUMPS
IN THE NICU SURGERY PROTOCOL

03:32.743 --> 03:36.216
IF YOU WANNA...
STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.749
(clipboard thuds)
YOU CRUSHED HIS HEART, APRIL,

03:38.749 --> 03:41.622
AND NONE OF US THOUGHT HE HAD
ONE, SO THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S INCONVENIENT.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.325
I NEED HIM TO SIGN THIS.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.357
UH, MORNING.
OH, GOOD MORNING.

03:46.357 --> 03:49.330
OH, UH, ANOTHER ALZHEIMER'S
TRIAL PATIENT TODAY, HUH?

03:49.330 --> 03:50.761
YES, SIR.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.933
GOOD, GOOD.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.906
HOW IS YOUR ISLET CELL
TRIAL GOING?

03:55.906 --> 03:57.908
HAVE YOU FOUND A RESIDENT
TO ASSIST YOU?

03:57.908 --> 04:01.912
UH, YEAH. UH, AVERY'S
GONNA HELP ME OUT TODAY.
GREAT. GOOD.

04:01.912 --> 04:04.415
AND, UH, MRS. WEBBER,
HOW IS SHE FEELING?

04:04.415 --> 04:07.348
UH, SHE'S DOING ALL RIGHT.
THANK--THANK YOU.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.280
(elevator bell dings)

04:09.280 --> 04:10.821
OH, SIR.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.455
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:14.455 --> 04:16.327
YOU...

04:16.327 --> 04:19.730
(indistinct conversations)

04:19.730 --> 04:21.662
(sighs)

04:21.662 --> 04:24.795
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:24.795 --> 04:28.299
WOW.
THAT KIDS LOOKS SCREWED.

04:28.299 --> 04:29.700
HE IS.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.272
HE HAS FIVE DIFFERENT
CARDIAC AND ABDOMINAL DEFECTS.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
I'M SUPPOSED TO OPERATE
ON HIM NEXT WEEK.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.948
THAT'S AWESOME.
CAN I SCRUB IN?
YEAH, IF YOU CAN GET US
TO AFRICA.

04:37.948 --> 04:40.551
HMM?
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
BACK THERE NEXT WEEK,

04:40.551 --> 04:43.654
BUT NOW I HAVE A VERY SICK
LITTLE GIRL OF MY OWN

04:43.654 --> 04:46.387
AND A FIANCéE
IN THE I.C.U.
FLY HIM OUT HERE.

04:46.387 --> 04:49.390
YEAH, I'VE TRIED, BUT YOU
CAN'T IMAGINE THE RED TAPE

04:49.390 --> 04:50.921
AND THE MONEY.

04:50.921 --> 04:53.524
AND THERE'S A DOZEN MORE
LIKE HIM

04:53.524 --> 04:55.526
THAT I'D WANT TO DO
THE SAME THING FOR.

04:55.526 --> 04:58.599
I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE
TO HELP 'EM OUT OVER THERE.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.972
I JUST... (sighs) I MADE
A PROMISE, THAT'S ALL.

05:04.835 --> 05:06.937
HEY, IT'S HEALING PRETTY WELL,

05:06.937 --> 05:08.939
AND MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

05:08.939 --> 05:11.382
YOU CAN TRY
SITTING UP BY YOURSELF.
LET'S TRY NOW.

05:11.382 --> 05:12.913
CAN'T RUSH IT.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.515
WHY'D I GET YOU?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.647
WHY AREN'T YOU CUTTING OUT
A HEART SOMEWHERE?

05:16.647 --> 05:20.090
WELL, ALTMAN AND I HAD
A FALLING OUT,

05:20.090 --> 05:22.593
OVER YOUR VENTRICULAR SEPTAL
DEFECT, ACTUALLY.

05:22.593 --> 05:25.396
MM.
I'M JUST GIVING HER
SOME SPACE.

05:25.396 --> 05:27.698
OKAY, YOU'RE GOOD.
OKAY, YOU NEED ANYTHING?

05:27.698 --> 05:30.601
I NEED TO SEE MY BABY.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.863
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:32.863 --> 05:34.605
(sighs)

05:34.605 --> 05:36.737
SHE'S MOSTLY TUBES AND WIRES.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.740
AND SHE LOOKS MORE LIKE
A CHICKEN THAN A BABY...

05:39.740 --> 05:42.342
LIKE A--LIKE A FEATHERLESS,
BEAKLESS CHICKEN.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.816
YOU WANT TO WAIT
TILL SHE'S CUTER.

05:45.816 --> 05:47.548
YOU'RE
THE WORST GODMOTHER EVER.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.550
YOU PICKED ME.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.552
SHE OPENED HER EYES.
(laughs)

05:51.552 --> 05:53.984
SOFIA--SHE--SHE LOOKED
RIGHT AT ME.

05:53.984 --> 05:56.757
I SAW HER SWEET LITTLE EYES.
THEY--THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.630
THEY LOOK JUST LIKE YOURS.
OH, MY GOD!

05:59.630 --> 06:03.894
I SHOULDA TAKEN PICTURES.
WHY DIDN'T I DO THAT?

06:03.894 --> 06:07.438
OH, NO. OH, NO.
OH, GOD, NO. I'M SO SORRY.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.900
GO, GO, GO, GO,
GET THE PICTURES!
OKAY.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.543
GO GET THE PICTURES THEN.
I'M SORRY. OH, OH, GOD.

06:12.543 --> 06:14.545
CALLIE.
(sobbing)

06:14.545 --> 06:15.906
CALLIE.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.578
NO, DON'T. CALLIE.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.780
CALLIE, STOP IT. STOP IT.
STOP IT, CALLIE!
(groans)

06:19.780 --> 06:21.852
YOU'LL RUPTURE YOUR SUTURES.
(crying)
I AM MISSING HER.

06:21.852 --> 06:23.554
I KNOW.
I'M MISSING HER.

06:23.554 --> 06:26.557
I KNOW. I KNOW, HONEY.
I KNOW.
SHE COULD DIE,
AND I'LL NEVER--

06:26.557 --> 06:29.960
I COULD MISS HER WHOLE LIFE!
(sobbing)
SHH. OKAY, OKAY.
EASY, EASY, RELAX.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.122
LIE BACK DOWN.
OH!

06:32.122 --> 06:34.565
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:34.565 --> 06:36.667
(alarm beeps)

06:36.667 --> 06:39.069
PULSE IS 102.

06:39.069 --> 06:42.433
ARE YOU NERVOUS, ED?
YEAH, IT'S KINDA LIKE GOING TO
THE DENTIST, ONLY WORSE.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.936
WELL, THIS IS GONNA BE OVER
BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW IT STARTS.
MM-HMM.

06:45.936 --> 06:48.108
DR. GREY
IS GONNA DO THE DRILL NOW.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.982
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FEEL ANYTHING, THOUGH.
(grunts)

06:51.982 --> 06:55.145
(monitor beeping erratically)
(Ed grunting)

06:55.145 --> 06:57.888
ED, TRY AND RELAX, OKAY?
(strained voice) I CAN'T.

06:57.888 --> 07:00.591
(grunts)
ALL RIGHT, STOP. STOP IT.
JUST PULL BACK.

07:00.591 --> 07:03.153
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET THE HALO
OFF. HE'S HAVING AN M.I.
OKAY.

07:03.153 --> 07:04.825
FLATLINE.
(groans)

07:04.825 --> 07:07.698
(alarm beeping)

07:07.698 --> 07:10.601
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

07:10.601 --> 07:13.734
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.715
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:24.715 --> 07:26.446
HIS E.K.G. WAS FINE?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.979
MM-HMM.
HE NEVER COMPLAINED
OF CHEST PAIN.

07:28.979 --> 07:31.852
I DID THE WORKUP. THERE WAS
NOTHING IN HIS HISTORY.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
IT WAS A MASSIVE M.I.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.056
AFTER WE INFORM
MR. BECKERT'S FAMILY,

07:36.056 --> 07:39.590
I WILL CALL THE F.D.A.
AND FILE A FORMAL REPORT.
IS THERE A CHANCE THEY COULD
SHUT DOWN THE TRIAL?

07:39.590 --> 07:42.192
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M GONNA SHUT IT DOWN,

07:42.192 --> 07:43.994
PENDING THE AUTOPSY.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.697
I WANT TO KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T
SEE IT COMING. (sighs)

07:46.697 --> 07:49.700
I THOUGHT DR. BAILEY SAID
TORRES CAN'T BE MOVED YET.
YES, SIR,

07:49.700 --> 07:52.102
BUT SINCE SHE HAS HAD
NO CONTACT WITH THE BABY,

07:52.102 --> 07:54.845
I WAS WONDERING HOW SOON
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO--
BRING THE BABY TO TORRES?

07:54.845 --> 07:56.947
I THINK IT'LL DO
THE BOTH OF THEM GOOD.

07:56.947 --> 07:59.710
UH, IF I COULD AT LEAST TELL
DR. TORRES WHEN SHE--
WHEN THE BABY
IS OFF THE VENT,

07:59.710 --> 08:02.753
WHEN SHE HAS AN IMMUNE SYSTEM
AND CAN WITHSTAND

08:02.753 --> 08:04.755
THE ONSLAUGHT
OF DEADLY INFECTIONS

08:04.755 --> 08:07.487
DR. TORRES WOULD THREATEN HER
WITH, THAT'S WHEN.
(exhales)

08:07.487 --> 08:11.121
I MEAN, COME ON. I'M ALL
FOR MOTHER/BABY BONDING,

08:11.121 --> 08:13.894
BUT NOT WHEN IT'LL KILL
THE BABY.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.496
WHY DO YOU EVEN ASK ME
THESE THINGS, HUH?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.529
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A DOCTOR.

08:18.529 --> 08:20.931
(elevator bell dings)
OUCH.

08:20.931 --> 08:24.635
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:24.635 --> 08:28.178
I NEED YOUR HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.180
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:30.180 --> 08:33.744
OH, WAIT. I HAVE, UH,
PATIENT 122's TRIAL PACKET.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.747
IT WAS NEVER OPENED, SO IT NEEDS
TO GO BACK INTO THE LOT.

08:36.747 --> 08:40.691
OH, OKAY. ONE SEC.
(keypad beeps and chirps)

08:40.691 --> 08:44.194
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.
I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.

08:44.194 --> 08:47.227
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
YOU, TOO.

08:50.701 --> 08:52.532
(knock on door)

08:52.532 --> 08:55.535
(Teddy) HENRY,
WILL YOU OPEN THE DOOR?
(blows air)

08:55.535 --> 08:57.537
I'M SORRY.
THE PLACE IS, UH...

08:57.537 --> 09:00.040
YOU WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO
TELL ME IF THIS IS NORMAL

09:00.040 --> 09:02.272
OR IF I NEED TO--IF NEED
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:02.272 --> 09:05.275
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT? WILL
YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND BE QUIET?

09:05.275 --> 09:08.178
DID YOU CHECK
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR?

18:46.756 --> 18:48.758
AND GET OUTTA MY FACE.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.861
(coughing)

18:51.861 --> 18:54.264
(oxygen hisses)

18:54.264 --> 18:57.207
OVERALL, ADELE SCORED A 23,
WHICH IS A MARKED DECLINE

18:57.207 --> 18:59.809
FROM THE LAST TIME
WE TESTED HER, WHICH WAS 27.

18:59.809 --> 19:03.413
MM-HMM.
SO SHE'S DEFINITELY
A LOT WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.

19:03.413 --> 19:06.816
WELL, THE UPSIDE IS,
SHE GETS IN THE TRIAL.
BUT SHE'S DECLINING SO FAST.

19:06.816 --> 19:10.180
I KNOW.
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GIVE HER
THE MEDICINE ON THE SIDE

19:10.180 --> 19:13.183
OUTSIDE OF THE TRIAL?
WHO WOULD KNOW?
NO. THE F.D.A. IS GONNA BE
ON US HARDER THAN EVER.

19:13.183 --> 19:15.185
ANYTHING WE DO
THAT TAINTS THE RESULTS

19:15.185 --> 19:16.856
COULD RUIN THE TRIAL,

19:16.856 --> 19:20.159
AND NOT TO MENTION
OUR CAREERS ALONG WITH IT.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.562
DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

19:24.194 --> 19:26.196
(Robert)
SHE'S IN HEART FAILURE.

19:26.196 --> 19:29.439
SHE'S GOTTA GO BACK
ON THE VENT.
SHE NEEDS SURGERY NOW?

19:29.439 --> 19:31.170
WELL, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.673
HER DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS
HASN'T CLOSED.
FLETCHER'S A NO-GO.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.577
I'M GONNA TRY TERRY LENNOX
AT SEATTLE PRES.
LOOK, I KNOW I'M NOT HIGH
ON YOUR LIST,

19:37.577 --> 19:40.710
BUT, UH, YOUR BABY'S OUT OF
TIME, YOU KNOW IT CAN'T BE YOU.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.712
I HAVE PERFORMED
THE PROCEDURE BEFORE, SO...

19:42.712 --> 19:44.954
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

19:44.954 --> 19:47.287
I UNDERSTAND. I--
AND, UH, ALTHOUGH

19:47.287 --> 19:50.220
YOU'RE NOT TECHNICALLY RELATED
TO THE BABY--
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

19:50.220 --> 19:52.462
THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE
NO ETHICAL OBJECTION

19:52.462 --> 19:54.894
IF I LET YOU
BE IN THE O.R. WITH ME.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.866
♪♪♪

19:56.866 --> 19:59.198
I MEAN, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER,

19:59.198 --> 20:02.201
YOU KNOW,
MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.703
♪♪♪

20:03.703 --> 20:05.575
Y--

20:05.575 --> 20:06.976
THANK YOU.

20:06.976 --> 20:09.379
OKAY. WE WILL PAGE YOU
WHEN WE'RE READY.

20:09.379 --> 20:11.641
(Mark) THANKS.
I'LL--I'LL GO TELL CALLIE.

20:11.641 --> 20:14.484
SO SHOULD I
GET HER PREPPED?

20:14.484 --> 20:17.947
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE I'M STUCK
WITH YOU, TOO, HUH?

20:17.947 --> 20:20.550
ARE YOU READY TO GO BACK?
MNH-MNH. ONE MORE LAP.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.552
WHAT,
DID YOU LOSE A BET?

20:22.552 --> 20:24.394
SHE'S MY NEW
PHYSICAL THERAPIST

20:24.394 --> 20:26.496
BECAUSE SHE DOES
WHAT I TELL HER TO.

20:26.496 --> 20:27.957
WHOSE CHARTS ARE THOSE?

20:27.957 --> 20:29.629
ALTMAN'S.
SHE'S BEING RIDICULOUS.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.631
I HAVEN'T SEEN
A CARDIO SURGERY IN A MONTH.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.763
SO YOU STOLE HER CHARTS?
YES, I STOLE HER CHARTS

20:33.763 --> 20:36.506
SO I WILL BE PREPARED
WHEN SHE COMES CRAWLING BACK.

20:36.506 --> 20:38.938
GREY, SIT.
I NEED THE RESISTANCE.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.641
(exhales)
OH, SO I RETESTED
ADELE WEBBER.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.573
SHE'S WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.

20:43.573 --> 20:45.975
BUT AT LEAST SHE'S GONNA
GET IN THE TRIAL.

20:45.975 --> 20:47.977
OKAY, SEE?! SEE?!
I SHOULD BE ON THIS.

20:47.977 --> 20:49.979
HOW DO I EVEN HAVE A SHOT
AT CHIEF RESIDENT

20:49.979 --> 20:52.322
IF I CAN'T DO
WHAT I'M GOOD AT?

20:52.322 --> 20:54.324
ALEX, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FIRED.

20:54.324 --> 20:57.327
I'M GONNA BE CHIEF RESIDENT.
YEAH, NOT IF YOU DON'T
WORK HERE ANYMORE.

20:57.327 --> 20:59.329
HE--HE SOLICITED
A PATIENT FOR MONEY.

20:59.329 --> 21:01.491
OH, YOU HOOKIN' NOW?
NO, MY AFRICAN KID THING.

21:01.491 --> 21:03.493
(scoffs) IT'S AGAINST
SO MANY RULES.

21:03.493 --> 21:05.665
WHO CARES?
THE OLD HAG COULD DIE,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.037
LEAVING HER MONEY
TO SAVE DYING CHILDREN.

21:08.037 --> 21:10.039
BUT INSTEAD, SHE'LL PROBABLY
LEAVE IT TO HER CATS,

21:10.039 --> 21:12.772
WHO PROBABLY HATE HER, TOO.
ARE YOU GOING TO RADIOLOGY?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.504
UH, HEY, EVERYBODY.
OFF. NOW.

21:14.504 --> 21:16.706
(panting)

21:16.706 --> 21:18.448
CALLIE.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.450
I DID FOUR LAPS TODAY.

21:20.450 --> 21:22.482
SOFIA NEEDS SURGERY.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.754
(continues panting)
WHAT?

21:24.754 --> 21:27.016
TODAY. NOW. SHE HAS WEAKNESS
IN HER LEFT VENTRICLE.

21:27.016 --> 21:29.018
SHE NEEDS A P.D.A. LIGATION.
(whispers) OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.321
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE,
AND I'M GONNA BE THERE.

21:31.321 --> 21:33.463
(inhales sharply) OH.
WHAT?

21:33.463 --> 21:36.696
(panting)

21:36.696 --> 21:38.998
CALLIE.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.471
(mutters)

21:41.471 --> 21:43.373
OH, MY... HELP!

21:43.373 --> 21:44.974
SOMEBODY HELP!

21:53.813 --> 21:56.916
ABDOMINAL WOUND DEHISCENCE
WITH A SMALL EVISCERATION.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.918
SHE'S WORKED HERSELF
INTO A RUPTURE.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.520
I SHOULD'VE
SEEN THIS COMING.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.522
I SHOULD'VE FORCED HER
TO STOP WALKING.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.594
I CHECK THAT WOUND
THREE TIMES A DAY.

22:04.594 --> 22:07.096
SHE NEVER COMPLAINED OF PAIN.
YANG, I'VE BEEN TELLING TORRES
TO SLOW DOWN FOR WEEKS.

22:07.096 --> 22:09.729
THE WOMAN DOESN'T LISTEN,
SO STOP KICKING YOURSELF

22:09.729 --> 22:11.701
AND JUST HELP ME FIX IT.

22:11.701 --> 22:13.603
BOVIE.
HOW BAD DOES IT LOOK?

22:13.603 --> 22:16.606
(cell phone rings and beeps)
HOW IS SHE?

22:16.606 --> 22:18.608
THEY'RE JUST STARTING NOW.

22:18.608 --> 22:20.670
B.P. IS, UH, 39 OVER 20.

22:20.670 --> 22:23.673
That's way too low.
NO, FOR A KID THIS SMALL,
IT'S FINE.

22:23.673 --> 22:26.616
YOU KNOW,
TALKING WILL DISTRACT ME.

22:26.616 --> 22:28.978
UH, I'M SORRY.
UM, I HAVE TO HANG UP.

22:28.978 --> 22:32.121
NO, I DIDN'T SAY HANG UP. JUST
KEEP IT DOWN, PLEASE. POTTS.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.027
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:38.027 --> 22:41.461
YOU'RE DUMBER THAN YOU LOOK.

22:46.496 --> 22:49.999
I'M GONNA HAVE YOUR JOB.

22:49.999 --> 22:51.971
NURSE!

22:51.971 --> 22:53.903
HELP ME, MRS. PULCHER.

22:53.903 --> 22:56.506
OH. NURSE! I'M GONNA
CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR...

22:56.506 --> 22:58.748
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.
AND HAVE YOU FIRED!

22:58.748 --> 23:01.511
I NEED YOUR HELP.
AND THEN I'M GONNA SUE
THIS HOSPITAL!

23:01.511 --> 23:03.983
PLEASE.
AND THEN
I'M GONNA SUE YOU!

23:03.983 --> 23:06.416
PLEASE.
GET OUT!

23:06.416 --> 23:09.058
I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE
YOUR FACE HERE AGAIN!

23:09.058 --> 23:11.791

23:11.791 --> 23:14.864
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
HE'S JUST GETTING READY
TO CLIP THE P.D.A.

23:14.864 --> 23:17.066
3-0 VICRYL.
SHE'S CLOSING NOW.

23:17.066 --> 23:19.929
NO LEAKS,
NO BLEEDERS, NO SEPSIS.

23:19.929 --> 23:22.401
B.P.'s GOOD,
SO WE'RE HOME.

23:22.401 --> 23:26.606
(monitor beeping erratically)

23:26.606 --> 23:28.608
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THE P.D.A. RIPPED.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.880
SUCTION. 6-0 PROLENE.
NOW. DAMN IT, NOW.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.582
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
(beeping continues)

23:32.582 --> 23:34.714
WHAT'S GOING ON, ROBBINS?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.946
(beeping continues)

23:40.990 --> 23:43.693
(panting) OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

23:43.693 --> 23:45.555
(crying) I'M SORRY.

23:45.555 --> 23:48.558
IF SHE...

23:48.558 --> 23:50.560
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

23:52.101 --> 23:54.103
(door opens)

23:57.767 --> 24:00.770
YOU NEED TO BE IN HERE.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.949
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:09.949 --> 24:12.952
YOU MISSED THE GOOD PART,
DR. ROBBINS.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.526
SHE TRIED TO BLEED OUT,
BUT I WOULDN'T LET HER.

24:16.526 --> 24:18.928
AND THE LUNG IS UP...

24:18.928 --> 24:21.460
AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

24:21.460 --> 24:25.995
ALL RIGHT.
5-0 VICRYL, PLEASE.

24:25.995 --> 24:30.600
AND EVERYBODY'S FINE.

24:32.502 --> 24:35.474
OKAY. LET'S GET YOU--
(coughs) DON'T TOUCH ME.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.508
(exhales deeply) OH,
SHE'S BEEN ASKING FOR YOU.

24:38.508 --> 24:40.249
GET IN HERE.

24:40.249 --> 24:43.012
THIS HAM-FISTED TWIT
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ROLL ME.

24:43.012 --> 24:46.485
YOU ASKED ME NOT TO COME BACK.
I'M ONLY--
JUST SHUT YOUR HOLE
AND GET IN HERE

24:46.485 --> 24:48.958
BEFORE THIS IDIOT
BREAKS MY SPINE.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.560

25:12.912 --> 25:15.815
100 GRAND, FINAL OFFER.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.788

HOW TO NEGOTIATE.
I'M NOT NEGOTIATING.

25:18.788 --> 25:22.752
OH, DON'T PRETEND TO BE SMART,
YOU CROOKED LITTLE BASTARD.

25:22.752 --> 25:26.155

25:45.244 --> 25:47.246
YEAH, AND THAT WAS ALL
BEFORE DINNER.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.849
YOU GOTTA TRY THIS PASTA.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.081
I'M IN.

25:52.081 --> 25:55.224
DID I TELL YOU THAT HIS HAIR
WAS LONGER THAN MINE?

25:55.224 --> 25:57.256
NO. NO. (laughs)

25:57.256 --> 25:59.258
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.791
I DON'T KNOW
WHY HIS ONLINE PHOTO

26:01.791 --> 26:06.135
DIDN'T FEATURE
HIS VERY,VERYLONG PONYTAIL.

26:06.135 --> 26:09.038
(laughs)
I LOVE THIS GUY.
MM.

26:09.038 --> 26:11.741
MMM. MMM.

26:13.703 --> 26:15.975

I'M BUYING.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.007

WHEN YOU BREAK THE RULES, MER?

26:25.755 --> 26:28.087
YOU GET 100,000 BUCKS.
DRINKS ARE ON ME.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.089

I CAN'T. I'M ON CALL.

26:30.089 --> 26:34.123

26:37.727 --> 26:39.328
NO. SHUT UP. NO.

26:39.328 --> 26:41.731
SHE HAD AN ARRHYTHMIA.
WELL, GET HER BACK.
I NEED HER.

26:41.731 --> 26:43.703
I--ALEX!
I HAD IT. I HAD IT!

26:43.703 --> 26:46.175
I'M SORRY.
NO, I HAD IT. I HAD IT!

26:46.175 --> 26:49.178
(panting)

26:51.340 --> 26:53.643
YOU BITCH.

26:53.643 --> 26:55.114
(sighs)

26:55.114 --> 26:57.216
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

26:57.216 --> 26:59.148
MRS. WEBBER.
HMM?

26:59.148 --> 27:01.320
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
SO LATE?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.392
OH, YOU KNOW,
RICHARD IS FINISHING UP,

27:03.392 --> 27:05.124
AND I'M JUST WAITING.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.997
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE ME
GO HOME ALONE.

27:07.997 --> 27:10.299
MM. MAY I SIT WITH YOU?

27:10.299 --> 27:13.833
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE.
YOU ON CALL TONIGHT?

27:13.833 --> 27:15.835
MM-HMM.

27:17.206 --> 27:19.168
SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

27:19.168 --> 27:21.640
YOU REALLY
WANT TO ASKMETHAT?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.743
IT'S HARD, I KNOW.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.775
YOU THINK SO?

27:25.775 --> 27:29.018
I ONLY KNOW FROM MY SIDE OF IT,
FROM MY EXPERIENCE.

27:29.018 --> 27:30.750
EXCUSE ME,

27:30.750 --> 27:33.652
BUT I HAVE NO USE
FOR YOUR SIDE OF IT.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.326
I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT,
THOUGHT I COULD LIVE WITH IT--

27:37.326 --> 27:40.329
IT WAS ONLY TEMPORARY--
THAT IT WAS GONNA GO AWAY,

27:40.329 --> 27:42.261
BUT CLEARLY, I WAS WRONG.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.934
IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE.

27:44.934 --> 27:47.196
I'M SORRY.

27:47.196 --> 27:50.900
(voice breaks) ARE YOU?
ARE YOU REALLY?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.802
(normal voice) THEN STOP.

27:52.802 --> 27:55.674
PLEASE, JUST STOP.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.676
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.679
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.012
BUT I THINK--
GOD HELP ME--

28:03.012 --> 28:06.115
ELLIS, I THINK
HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

28:06.115 --> 28:09.158
AND IF YOU'RE NOT, PLEASE...

28:09.158 --> 28:12.091
GIVE HIM BACK.

28:13.763 --> 28:15.965
ADELE, IT'S--IT'S MEREDITH.

28:15.965 --> 28:18.297
NOT ELLIS.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.970
IT'S MEREDITH.
I'M HER DAUGHTER.
(cries)

28:20.970 --> 28:23.232
ELLIS IS GONE.
SHE DIED.

28:23.232 --> 28:26.736
(crying) PLEASE
GIVE ME BACK MY HUSBAND.

28:26.736 --> 28:29.338
PLEASE...

28:29.338 --> 28:32.111
GIVE ME BACK MY HUSBAND.
