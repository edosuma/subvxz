WEBVTT

01:57.910 --> 02:00.787
Out, all of you.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.958
This bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!

02:06.043 --> 02:08.877
I want you and your men

02:10.255 --> 02:11.255
gone.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.134
And you will make this right.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.764
Wait outside.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.641
- Lord Commander...
- Now!

02:42.162 --> 02:44.163
- Lord Commander...
- Leave us.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.875
What did you do?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.253
I followed him.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.172
He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.924
What business is that of yours?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.425
No, you don't understand.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.970
He's killing them, all the boys.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.893
You know.

03:09.565 --> 03:13.860
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or l.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.031
Those boys are Craster's offerings.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.408
Offerings?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.618
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.162
Aye, many a time
that monster has been the difference

03:25.247 --> 03:27.582
between life and death for our rangers,

03:27.666 --> 03:29.584
your uncle among them.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.254
We have other wars to fight out there.

03:34.339 --> 03:38.134
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.640
I...

03:45.058 --> 03:46.475
I saw it.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.897
I saw

03:53.150 --> 03:55.443
something take that child.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.572
Yeah. Whatever it was,

04:00.616 --> 04:02.241
I daresay you'll see it again.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.204
Now, ready my horse.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.540
We leave at dawn.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.048
Don't lose it again.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.782
Gilly.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.703
You're leaving.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.374
I... l wanted to give you something.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.797
It belonged to my mother.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.801
- I can't take it.
- Please.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.970
I want you to.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.558
My mother used it for sewing.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.729
She'd let me sit with her in her chamber
while she sewed

05:14.314 --> 05:15.606
and I'd read to her.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.570
My father put a stop to it when he found out.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.408
It's the only thing I have of hers.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.744
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.372
You...

05:31.456 --> 05:32.790
You shouldn't give it away.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.750
I'm not giving it away.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.753
I'm giving it to you.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.258
Keep it safe for me.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.927
Till I come back.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.198
Hodor.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.952
Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.445
Every night it's the same.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.156
I'm walking

06:47.783 --> 06:49.617
and running, but...

06:52.037 --> 06:54.497
I'm not... I'm not me.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.958
I'm running through the godswood,

06:58.043 --> 06:59.710
sniffing the dirt,

07:00.504 --> 07:03.589
tasting blood in my mouth
when I've made a fresh kill,

07:04.841 --> 07:06.217
howling.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.763
Old Nan used to tell me stories

07:10.847 --> 07:12.807
about magical people who could live

07:12.891 --> 07:15.684
inside stags, birds,

07:16.353 --> 07:17.645
wolves.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.563
That's exactly what they are, Bran,

07:20.148 --> 07:22.399
- stories.
- So she was lying?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.736
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.489
But they're gone from the world,

07:28.573 --> 07:30.574
along with much else.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.871
These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.582
No, my dreams are different.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.543
Mine are true.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.962
I dreamt of my father dying.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.965
And Rickon had the same dream.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.884
What about all the dreams you had
that didn't come true?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.346
Hmm?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.685
Right.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.564
This link is made of Valyrian steel.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.860
Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.322
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.743
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.745
I was no different.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.497
I was young.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.710
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

08:23.587 --> 08:26.922
to lift him out of his dull life
into a special one?

08:28.049 --> 08:30.301
But in the end, for all my efforts,

08:30.385 --> 08:33.679
I got no more out of it
than a thousand boys before me.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.472
Come on.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.400
All right.

08:47.611 --> 08:51.238
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.326
But not anymore.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.121
The dragons are gone.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.290
The giants are dead.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.462
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.347
Loras! Highgarden!

10:03.478 --> 10:04.645
Get him!

10:09.109 --> 10:10.276
Oh!

10:12.320 --> 10:14.738
Yield! I yield.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.083
Well fought. Approach.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.720
Rise. Remove your helm.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.523
You are all your father promised
and more, my lady.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.817
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice,

10:51.901 --> 10:53.944
but never quite in that fashion.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.990
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.618
That he did, my queen.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.204
But there can only be one champion.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.665
Brienne of Tarth,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.834
you may ask anything of me you desire.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.587
If it is within my power, it is yours.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.549
Your Grace,

11:15.633 --> 11:18.552
I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.346
What?

11:20.430 --> 11:23.223
I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

11:23.308 --> 11:25.476
and keep you safe from all harm.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.190
Done.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.318
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.789
Your Grace, I have
the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

11:46.873 --> 11:49.833
sent as an envoy
by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.128
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.382
Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.469
May I present my wife,
Margaery of House Tyrell?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.515
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.141
I'm so sorry for your loss.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.395
You are most kind.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.979
My lady,

12:11.981 --> 12:15.651
I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer
for your husband's murder.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.987
When I take King's Landing,

12:19.572 --> 12:21.156
I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.419
It will be enough
to know that justice was done, my lord.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.837
Your Grace.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.923
And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.260
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

12:41.344 --> 12:44.513
Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.850
I do not sit on my son's war councils.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.937
And if I did,
I would not share his strategies with you.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.023
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.775
not hide behind his mother's skirts.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.864
My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.212
Don't worry, my lady.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.381
Our war is just beginning.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.480
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.232
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.568
They don't know their own size is all.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.069
Good man.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.741
I have 100,000 men at my command.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.035
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.872
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

13:52.749 --> 13:54.958
It's a game to you, isn't it?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.461
- I pity them.
- Why?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.296
Because it won't last.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.091
Because they are the knights of summer
and winter is coming.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.472
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.601
- She's tired from herjourney.
- At once, Your Grace.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.062
- Shall I return after?
- That won't be necessary.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.648
I would pray awhile. Alone.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.401
If you'll follow me, my lady.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.115
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.493
I fought for my king.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.496
Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.456
Die for him if I must.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.544
And, if it please you, Brienne's enough.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.338
I'm no lady.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.663
What are you doing here?

15:14.998 --> 15:16.373
I live here.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.585
Are you angry with me, brother?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.044
You lying bitch.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.755
It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.842
Recognize you? How could I?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.011
The last time I saw you...

15:31.014 --> 15:32.931
you looked like a fat little boy.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.310
You were a fat little boy, too,

15:36.686 --> 15:38.520
but I recognized you.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.355
Why didn't you tell me?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.441
I wanted to see who you were first.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.234
And I did.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.656
The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.658
- Father.
- Father.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.455
The wolf pup has gone south

15:56.539 --> 15:59.625
with the entirety
of the Northern army at his back.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.461
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

16:02.545 --> 16:04.963
the North is ripe for the taking.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.675
The ironborn will reave and pillage,
as it was in the old days,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.053
all along the northern coast.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.972
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

16:14.057 --> 16:16.850
securing the Neck and everything above.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.728
Every stronghold will yield to us,
one by one.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.648
Winterfell may defy us for a year,
but what of it?

16:22.732 --> 16:24.441
The rest shall be ours,

16:24.525 --> 16:27.527
forest, field, and hall.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.993
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships

16:35.078 --> 16:36.870
to attack Deepwood Motte.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.122
I've always wanted a castle.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.500
And what's my role in all this?

16:43.044 --> 16:46.880
You'll take a ship to raid
the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.173
A ship?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.717
You give her 30 and I get one?

16:50.802 --> 16:54.096
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she'd be perfect for you.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.058
I'm to fight fishermen?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.185
Be careful of their nets.

17:03.606 --> 17:07.358
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.695
- He won't give up the North so easily.
- They won't even know we're there

17:10.780 --> 17:12.531
- until it's too late.
- What do you know of it, woman?

17:12.615 --> 17:13.990
I'm a proven warrior.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.411
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

17:17.494 --> 17:20.914
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.751
I'm not protecting anyone.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.837
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.382
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.260
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.762
But if we pledge fealty to them,

17:36.097 --> 17:37.681
they'll give us Casterly Rock.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.516
What are our words?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.602
Our words?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.233
- We do not sow.
- We do not sow.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.901
We are ironborn.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.612
We're not subjects. We're not slaves.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.741
We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.826
We take what is ours.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.164
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.712
You act as if I volunteered to go.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.090
You gave me away, if you remember.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.509
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.595
After he crushed you.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.472
Did you take what was yours then?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.102
You gave me away!

18:25.438 --> 18:26.688
Your boy!

18:27.440 --> 18:29.065
Your last boy!

18:30.151 --> 18:33.695
You gave me away
like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.907
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.462
You'd have our father
bow down to your other family?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.881
I have no other family.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.341
Don't you?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.804
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.389
Our ships sail with or without you.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.153
You won't let me leave this room.

19:15.238 --> 19:18.073
- You won't let me...
- Keep your voice down.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.745
Why? You think your father can hear me?

19:24.413 --> 19:26.623
He's 300 miles away!

19:29.252 --> 19:31.837
I don't intend for you to stay here.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.215
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.717
Again, only temporary.

19:39.387 --> 19:43.265
Every man who has tasted my cooking
has told me what a good whore I am.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.308
But you wouldn't be a cook.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.186
You'd pose as a scullion.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.107
Scullion? What is a scullion?

19:53.276 --> 19:54.776
Kitchen wench.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.737
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but...

19:57.822 --> 20:01.950
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.578
Your lion wants to see you alive.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.872
We've come to a dangerous place.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.832
My sister wants to hurt me.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.876
She'll look for any weakness she can find.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.961
She can't know about you.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.171
I'm the weakness?

20:15.256 --> 20:16.756
It's a compliment, my lady.

20:17.258 --> 20:20.051
How is being a weakness a compliment?

20:23.514 --> 20:25.307
Language can be a bit tricky here.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.516
Oh.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.894
I'm too stupid to understand.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.104
The stupid foreign girl.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.818
I am not a kitchen wench.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.679
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.932
Soon, darling, when the war is over.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.809
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

21:09.894 --> 21:11.853
and another for the feast.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.357
But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.947
The Princess just spoke to you.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.615
Pardon, Your Grace.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.828
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.082
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

21:32.166 --> 21:35.710
and I can pledge
my love to the King in sight of the gods.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.384
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.763
He might.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.101
Would you like that?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.854
No. I don't think so.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.985
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.989
Won't you, little dove?

22:22.758 --> 22:24.092
Come in.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.014
Who are you?

22:29.098 --> 22:31.808
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.478
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.190
- You're not from here.
- No.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.407
What are you doing?

22:47.491 --> 22:49.200
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

22:49.285 --> 22:53.371
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.540
What things?

22:56.417 --> 22:58.209
Change my linens, wash my clothing,

22:58.294 --> 23:01.546
scrub the floor,
empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.390
- No.
- You said to brush...

23:12.475 --> 23:13.975
Not now.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.147
Your chamber pot is empty.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.816
Clean the table.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.574
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

23:29.867 --> 23:31.326
- Yes.
- For whom?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.328
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

23:35.998 --> 23:37.373
Lady Zuriff.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.752
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.213
She wasn't in this city.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.548
I don't know how they did things in that city,

23:45.633 --> 23:48.384
but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies,

23:48.469 --> 23:50.011
not the other way around.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.931
And I don't have time
to answer a thousand questions

23:53.015 --> 23:55.350
and teach you how to do your job.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.146
Do you want me to leave?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.073
Just brush my hair.

24:24.588 --> 24:25.630
Oh!

24:25.714 --> 24:27.382
Thank the gods.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.634
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.637
I've encountered
this problem before, my lord.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.431
The stresses of power often have this

24:36.517 --> 24:38.351
insalubrious effect.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.062
Two drops with water, daily.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.356
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man

24:43.440 --> 24:46.317
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.903
- Please.
- Thank you, my lord.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.910
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

24:55.995 --> 24:57.704
Why, yes, of course, my lord.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.998
These are perilous times.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.083
And the crown must forge new alliances.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.588
And these alliances
must often be sealed in matrimony.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.591
Matrimony, huh?

25:10.050 --> 25:11.426
Yes.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.638
I'm trusting the council with these plans,
but the Queen mustn't know.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.183
We can't have her meddling in affairs

25:18.267 --> 25:21.102
that could determine the future of the realm.
There's too much at stake.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.771
Oh, yes, yes. lndeed, yes.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.441
I shall be silent as the grave.

25:27.610 --> 25:31.070
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

25:31.906 --> 25:35.200
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son
when she comes of age,

25:35.284 --> 25:36.784
ensuring their loyalty

25:36.869 --> 25:39.287
and their army, should we need it.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.957
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

25:45.294 --> 25:48.004
But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.089
Ooh.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.091
"The Queen mustn't know."

25:52.760 --> 25:55.428
I love conversations that begin this way.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.973
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off

25:59.308 --> 26:00.683
to Theon Greyjoy.

26:02.353 --> 26:03.853
Theon Greyjoy?

26:05.022 --> 26:07.398
Forgive me, my lord, but how?

26:07.483 --> 26:10.026
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.946
- He fights for Robb Stark.
- Precisely.

26:13.030 --> 26:17.992
Theon's father loathes the Starks
and will convince the boy to come to our side.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.579
Greyjoy can destroy
the Northern army from within

26:21.664 --> 26:24.040
and we can have his father's ships.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.876
But remember, you must tell no one.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.129
Tell no one what?

26:30.881 --> 26:33.967
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella
to Robin Arryn of the Vale.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.513
Lysa is not fond of me.

26:38.973 --> 26:44.560
But perhaps the promise of a royal match
will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

26:44.979 --> 26:48.898
She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.401
And you offer her son a princess?

26:52.319 --> 26:55.738
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

26:55.823 --> 26:57.532
an encumbrance, don't you think?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.786
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

27:01.870 --> 27:03.329
Who better?

27:07.501 --> 27:11.713
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa,
if I cared to.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.424
What's in it for me?

27:16.719 --> 27:20.471
The gratitude of the people of Westeros
for helping to end this war,

27:20.556 --> 27:24.809
the adoration of the King
for bringing the Vale back into the fold...

27:26.562 --> 27:27.812
and Harrenhal.

27:28.439 --> 27:30.064
Harrenhal is cursed.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.734
Never took you for a superstitious man.

27:32.818 --> 27:36.487
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You'll be able to afford it.

27:36.572 --> 27:39.407
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.120
With a single stroke, you'd make me
one of the greatest lords in the realm.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.332
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.460
So did Janos Slynt,
and he was given Harrenhal, too.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.587
Until you snatched it away.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.757
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.884
I didn't need Janos Slynt.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.680
It's settled, then?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.100
Good.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.146
Oh. And remember...

28:10.230 --> 28:12.231
The Queen mustn't know.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.897
That must hurt.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.742
What?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.329
What is it?

29:10.207 --> 29:12.333
A member of the Kingsguard?

29:14.002 --> 29:16.170
As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

29:18.507 --> 29:21.926
Brienne is a very capable warrior.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.847
And she's devoted to me.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.225
You're jealous.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.353
Jealous?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.397
Of Brienne the Beauty?

29:35.107 --> 29:36.858
Don't make me laugh.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.737
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.031
Not tonight.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.202
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.331
You didn't win my father's support
or his army on charm alone.

30:05.721 --> 30:09.056
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.268
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.312
And Margaery's a virgin?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.314
Officially.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.984
Shall I bring her to you?

30:46.929 --> 30:50.640
I should warn you,
I've had quite a bit of wine.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.934
As is your right. You are a king.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.355
You look very beautiful.

30:57.731 --> 30:59.190
Thank you, Your Grace.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.527
- It's a lovely gown.
- You think so?

31:03.779 --> 31:05.821
I can't decide how I like it better.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.156
This way,

31:07.908 --> 31:10.618
or this way.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.793
You certainly don't need it.

31:20.420 --> 31:25.341
Although, some say the beauty most desired

31:25.425 --> 31:27.385
is the beauty concealed.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.195
Must be the wine.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.114
Here, let me.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.594
I'm sorry.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.556
Do you want my brother to come in and help?

32:16.184 --> 32:18.227
- What?
- He could get you started.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.562
I know he wouldn't mind.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.106
Or I can turn over
and you can pretend I'm him.

32:24.693 --> 32:26.777
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.994
There's no need for us to play games.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.623
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

32:57.059 --> 33:02.146
Your enemies aren't happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.482
And the best way to stop them

33:05.567 --> 33:07.276
is to put your baby

33:08.570 --> 33:10.071
in my belly.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.785
We can try again later.

33:16.703 --> 33:20.081
You decide how you want to do it,
with me, with me and Loras,

33:20.165 --> 33:22.041
however else you like.

33:25.379 --> 33:27.380
Whatever you need to do.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.051
You are a king.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.104
CERSEl: You monster.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.023
Myrcella is my only daughter.

33:46.108 --> 33:48.734
Do you really think
I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

33:48.819 --> 33:51.946
Myrcella's a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.783
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne
as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.035
Dorne is the safest place for her.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.122
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.999
That's why we need to seduce them.

34:04.084 --> 34:07.586
We're going to need their support in the war
your son started.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.964
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.134
You won't get away with this.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.469
You think the piece of paper Father gave you
keeps you safe.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.516
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.355
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.859
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

34:33.362 --> 34:36.364
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is
if this city falls?

34:36.449 --> 34:40.369
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

34:40.454 --> 34:42.121
Make no mistake.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.831
They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike
right beside yours.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.833
Get out! Get out!

35:49.481 --> 35:52.149
Theon of the House Greyjoy,

35:52.234 --> 35:55.319
you would this day
consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

36:03.870 --> 36:06.121
- I would.
- Kneel.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.001
Let Theon, your servant,

36:11.086 --> 36:13.838
be born again from the sea as you were.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.632
Bless him with salt.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.345
Bless him with stone.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.806
Bless him with steel.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.440
What is dead may never die.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.237
But rises again harder and stronger.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.739
Stand.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.605
I don't appreciate
being made a fool of, dwarf.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.441
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy,

37:15.525 --> 37:17.985
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

37:18.194 --> 37:21.071
No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.448
And Harrenhal,

37:23.158 --> 37:26.076
I suppose that's off the table as well.

37:26.161 --> 37:29.705
Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.333
Leave me out of your next deception.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.126
That's a shame.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.754
You were to be
the centerpiece of my next deception.

37:37.547 --> 37:40.424
My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.345
I would see him released.
That's where you come in.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.889
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.934
No, he won't. But his mother might.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.729
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.193
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.195
And he has company.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.532
Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.034
No, you don't.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.911
No, I don't.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.504
What is the meaning of this?

38:18.588 --> 38:20.798
No, please, please.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.008
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.302
I am your loyal servant.

38:25.387 --> 38:29.139
So loyal that you told the Queen
about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.058
No! Never!

38:31.226 --> 38:33.435
It's a falsehood. I swear it.

38:33.603 --> 38:35.104
It wasn't me.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.356
Ah, Varys.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.150
It was Varys the Spider.

38:40.235 --> 38:44.321
See, I told Varys that
I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.

38:44.990 --> 38:48.784
I told Littlefinger
that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.162
I told no one
that I was offering her to the Dornish.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.957
No one but you.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.501
The eunuch has spies everywhere.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.628
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.464
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.841
Well, make do.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.804
How long have you been spying for my sister?

39:08.888 --> 39:11.724
All I did, I did for House Lannister.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.059
Always. Your lord father, ask him.

39:14.144 --> 39:17.646
I've always been his servant
since the days of the Mad King.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.775
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

39:22.277 --> 39:24.903
What? No. No.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.909
How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?

39:30.994 --> 39:33.037
Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

39:33.121 --> 39:35.039
Lord Arryn, he knew.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.791
He knew the truth about the Queen.

39:38.126 --> 39:43.255
And... he planned to act, to tell King Robert.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.631
So you poisoned him?

39:45.300 --> 39:47.051
No. Never.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.845
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

39:49.929 --> 39:52.556
Lannister... l always served Lannister.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.309
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.102
No. No, no, no. No, please.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.146
Don't! You can't do this to me!

40:00.690 --> 40:01.982
For your trouble.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.051
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend

40:29.135 --> 40:32.012
is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.808
Good. One of my better ideas.

40:35.892 --> 40:40.187
And it seems the Grand Maester
has found his way into a black cell?

40:42.732 --> 40:44.858
Well played, My Lord Hand.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.612
But should I be worried?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.656
Janos Slynt, Pycelle...

40:50.990 --> 40:53.534
The Small Council grows smaller every day.

40:53.618 --> 40:57.037
The Council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.790
I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.502
Power is a curious thing, my lord.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.588
Are you fond of riddles?

41:06.673 --> 41:08.674
Why, am I about to hear one?

41:08.758 --> 41:10.968
Three great men sit in a room.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.846
A king, a priest and a rich man.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.640
Between them stands a common sellsword.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.435
Each great man
bids the sellsword kill the other two.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.230
Who lives, who dies?

41:24.149 --> 41:25.607
Depends on the sellsword.

41:25.692 --> 41:29.987
Does it? He has neither crown
nor gold nor favor with the gods.

41:30.071 --> 41:32.239
He has a sword, the power of life and death.

41:32.323 --> 41:36.994
But if it's swordsmen who rule,
why do we pretend kings hold all the power?

41:37.579 --> 41:41.874
When Ned Stark lost his head,
who was truly responsible?

41:42.500 --> 41:46.336
Joffrey? The executioner?
Or something else?

41:46.421 --> 41:48.630
I've decided I don't like riddles.

41:51.759 --> 41:55.345
Power resides where men believe it resides.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.975
It's a trick, a shadow on the wall.

42:01.019 --> 42:06.982
And a very small man
can cast a very large shadow.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.274
You should be sleeping.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.486
Tomorrow's a long march.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.822
Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.

42:57.492 --> 42:58.700
I can't sleep.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.499
I don't like the taste.

43:11.297 --> 43:14.675
You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.059
What?

43:25.395 --> 43:27.062
How do you sleep?

43:27.522 --> 43:29.564
Same as most men, I think.

43:29.983 --> 43:32.359
But you've seen things,

43:33.778 --> 43:35.404
horrible things.

43:36.531 --> 43:37.531
Aye.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.535
I've seen some pretty things, too,

43:41.619 --> 43:43.537
but not nearly so many.

43:45.373 --> 43:47.541
How do you sleep when you...

43:49.419 --> 43:53.213
When you have those things in your head?

43:55.967 --> 43:57.467
You didn't see that.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.220
I made damn sure.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.431
I close my eyes and I see them up there.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.559
All of them

44:06.311 --> 44:07.978
standing there.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.605
Joffrey,

44:12.775 --> 44:15.277
the Queen and...

44:17.071 --> 44:18.572
and my sister.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.668
You know, we've got
something in common, me and you.

44:31.753 --> 44:33.170
You know that?

44:34.255 --> 44:35.964
I must have been

44:37.050 --> 44:39.426
a couple of years older than you.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.597
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart

44:43.681 --> 44:45.974
right on our doorstep.

44:46.059 --> 44:49.102
He weren't much of a villain
what skewered him.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.688
Willem, the lad's name was.

44:53.608 --> 44:56.151
He ran off before anyone could spit.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.237
And I just stood there,

45:00.323 --> 45:02.324
watching my brother die.

45:03.826 --> 45:06.119
Here's the funny part.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.956
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.334
But Willem,

45:12.960 --> 45:15.003
oh, he was a nice-looking boy.

45:17.423 --> 45:20.967
He had good white teeth, blue eyes,

45:22.261 --> 45:25.347
one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.

45:28.059 --> 45:31.019
I would think about him when I was working,

45:31.104 --> 45:34.147
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

45:35.316 --> 45:37.025
It got to the point

45:37.443 --> 45:40.612
where I would say his name every night
before I went to bed.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.531
Willem. Willem.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.574
Willem.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.702
A prayer almost.

45:49.914 --> 45:51.498
Well, one day,

45:53.751 --> 45:56.336
Willem came riding back into town.

46:00.341 --> 46:05.804
I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull
they had to bury him with it.

46:09.267 --> 46:13.854
Willem's horse got me to the Wall
and I've been wearing black ever since.

46:19.861 --> 46:22.487
That'll help you sleep, eh?

46:29.287 --> 46:30.370
Ho!

46:30.455 --> 46:33.540
Get up, you lazy sons of whores!

46:33.624 --> 46:35.292
Arm yourselves.

46:36.461 --> 46:38.086
- Get up.
- Get up.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.172
Keep out of sight, both of you.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.590
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

46:41.674 --> 46:43.300
Keep out of sight.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.553
If things go wrong, you run.

46:46.637 --> 46:50.557
Do you hear me?
You run along north and don't look back.

46:52.101 --> 46:55.395
Hey, there's men out there
who want to fuck your corpses.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.689
Outside, now!

46:59.775 --> 47:01.401
Come on, move, move!

47:03.279 --> 47:04.738
Gold cloaks!

47:10.453 --> 47:11.995
Everyone out!

47:16.918 --> 47:20.086
Hey, you! Open the damn cage!

47:23.925 --> 47:25.467
Where's the bastard, crow?

47:25.551 --> 47:28.011
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

47:28.095 --> 47:31.181
Ser Amory Lorch,
sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.

47:31.265 --> 47:34.643
These men from the capital
requested our assistance.

47:35.228 --> 47:37.437
Drop your weapons in the name of the King.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.356
Now, which king would that be?

47:39.440 --> 47:41.441
This is your last chance.

47:41.943 --> 47:46.238
In the name of King Joffrey,
drop your weapons.

47:49.784 --> 47:51.576
I don't think I will.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.286
So be it.

47:56.874 --> 48:00.126
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.375
Boy, come here. Boy!

48:40.459 --> 48:43.878
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

48:43.963 --> 48:45.088
Help us, boy!

48:49.051 --> 48:51.553
A man can fight! Free us!

48:58.686 --> 49:00.520
Quick, give it to me.

49:01.897 --> 49:03.523
Give me the ax. Give me that.

49:13.367 --> 49:14.951
Put them on the wagon!

49:15.870 --> 49:17.329
There's more here. Come on.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.669
What do we have here?

49:26.213 --> 49:27.672
No!

49:28.257 --> 49:30.383
That's a fine little blade.

49:32.178 --> 49:33.637
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.388
I yield! I yield!

49:35.473 --> 49:37.682
Round up any survivors.

49:37.767 --> 49:39.893
We'll take them back to Harrenhal.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.604
You heard him. You're coming with us.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.023
I yield!

49:50.613 --> 49:51.780
Help!

49:51.864 --> 49:53.281
Help me!

49:57.662 --> 49:59.245
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.081
Look at it.

50:09.256 --> 50:10.674
Can you walk?

50:11.008 --> 50:12.967
No. You got to carry me.

50:14.428 --> 50:15.845
All right.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.320
"Carry him," he says.

50:41.288 --> 50:43.623
We're looking for a bastard named Gendry.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.917
Give him up

50:46.627 --> 50:48.712
or I'll start taking eyeballs.

51:01.684 --> 51:02.809
You want Gendry?

51:06.897 --> 51:08.648
You already got him.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.696
He loved that helmet.
