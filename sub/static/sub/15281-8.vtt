<i>National news network
How may I direct your call ?</i>

00:06.833 --> 00:09.141
There's going to be
an explosion this morning

00:09.240 --> 00:11.320
<i>- Excuse me ?</i>
- I said,

00:11.593 --> 00:14.002
there will be an explosion
this morning.

00:14.073 --> 00:15.220
A bomb.

00:15.293 --> 00:17.674
<i>Oh, Sorry.
Did you say a bomb, sir ?</i>

00:18.252 --> 00:20.087
<i>- Sir ?</i>
- On a bus...

00:20.604 --> 00:22.468
in the city where it all began.

00:22.593 --> 00:24.179
Get my message out.

00:24.256 --> 00:25.440
<i>Message ?</i>

00:25.673 --> 00:26.887
<i>What message ?</i>

00:27.156 --> 00:29.085
That this is only the beginning.

00:29.344 --> 00:31.516
Until it is brought back
under control,

00:33.249 --> 00:35.120
people will die.

Hey ! Mornin', JJ.
How was your...

01:02.306 --> 01:03.553
weekend ?

01:04.848 --> 01:05.750
Yeah ?

01:05.767 --> 01:09.150
Homeland security just reported a bomb
threat for an unspecified urban area.

01:09.167 --> 01:10.732
It was phoned into
the national news network

01:10.758 --> 01:13.113
- I'll call you back. When ?
- Last half hour.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.553
- They need a threat assessment ASAP.
- Get the team together.

01:15.566 --> 01:16.482
Yeah.

01:17.835 --> 01:20.192
<i>I'm sorry,
Did you say a bomb, sir ?</i>

01:20.438 --> 01:21.562
<i>On a bus...</i>

01:21.576 --> 01:23.171
<i>in the city where it all began.</i>

01:23.396 --> 01:24.723
<i>Get my message out.</i>

01:24.736 --> 01:26.901
<i>Message ?
What message ?</i>

01:27.255 --> 01:29.222
<i>That this is only the beginning.<i></i></i>

01:29.635 --> 01:31.770
<i>Until it is brought back
under control,</i>

01:32.116 --> 01:33.923
<i>people will die.</i>

01:35.215 --> 01:36.663
In the last 20 minutes,

01:36.677 --> 01:38.771
virtually identical threats
have been made

01:38.785 --> 01:41.583
to most of the coast-to-coast
news networks in the country.

01:41.747 --> 01:44.751
It's the same information
just slightly different words.

01:44.965 --> 01:46.972
So it's not a recorded
message or script.

01:46.987 --> 01:48.581
Displays a measure of confidence.

01:48.596 --> 01:50.610
He could have easily
just called one network.

01:50.628 --> 01:52.571
This guy obviously wants attention.

01:52.588 --> 01:55.271
It's typical behavior
for a personal cause bomber.

01:56.288 --> 01:59.762
One bomb has a finite impact.
It's just a little package.

02:00.145 --> 02:03.502
Make bunch of phone calls,
that magnifies my explosion 100 times.

02:03.627 --> 02:06.690
We have the additional recorded calls
being gathered for assessment.

02:06.887 --> 02:09.252
Networks say the calls came
from a restricted number.

02:09.268 --> 02:11.483
Two have given limited permission
to trap and trace

02:11.486 --> 02:13.332
the lines if we should need to.

02:13.368 --> 02:15.780
You got a news organization
to agree to a trap and trace ?

02:15.797 --> 02:16.970
Who could say "no" to me ?

02:16.985 --> 02:19.792
This is not likely Al-Qaeda. They don't
call unless they bomb something.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.941
At Homeland security's request,
the networks are going to keep this quiet

02:22.957 --> 02:25.952
- until we've assessed the situation.
- It doesn't feel like a hoax.

02:26.245 --> 02:29.510
His voice is calm, resigned. He's made
his decision. He's committed to it.

02:29.668 --> 02:32.583
Plus he said :
"This is only the beginning"

02:32.858 --> 02:34.560
The beginning of what ?
And he also said :

02:34.577 --> 02:38.000
"until it is brought back
under control". What's it ?

02:38.136 --> 02:40.751
He has to call back. And if this threat
isn't followed by an event,

02:40.768 --> 02:42.942
no one will take
any future calls seriously.

02:43.105 --> 02:45.853
So, we're going to tell the media
to go ahead with the story ?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.193
Absolutely not.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.081
Threats like this,
with an unspecified location

02:50.106 --> 02:52.053
will just cause tremendous panic.

02:52.376 --> 02:54.470
Then, what are we gonna do ?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.743
Unfortunately,
all we can do is wait.

04:59.438 --> 05:01.620
So Seattle's where it all began.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.191
We just need to figure out what it is.
And off the top of my head,

05:04.205 --> 05:06.581
I can think of grunge music
and overpriced coffee.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.701
That doesn't seem significant
enough for terrorism.

05:08.716 --> 05:10.143
It's a personal cause bomber.

05:10.155 --> 05:12.790
It only needs
to be of significance to him.

05:15.735 --> 05:17.421
Agent Nick Casey,
Seattle field office.

05:17.438 --> 05:19.213
S. S. A. Hotchner, how do you do ?

05:19.288 --> 05:21.752
This is Dr. Spencer Reid,
S. S. A. Morgan,

05:21.856 --> 05:24.203
agent Jareau,
and S. S. A. Gideon.

05:24.405 --> 05:26.173
Have you identified the device ?

05:26.187 --> 05:28.523
Looks like a small pipe bomb
attached to an umbrella

05:28.635 --> 05:30.740
I'd like to take a look at those
bomb fragments as soon as possible

05:30.757 --> 05:33.352
- I've got bomb squad experience.
- As soon as they're catalogued.

05:33.386 --> 05:35.981
How many people were on the bus
when the explosion went off ?

05:36.128 --> 05:37.712
25 including the driver.

05:37.786 --> 05:39.523
Explosion killed two.

05:39.555 --> 05:42.123
The driver and a young male.
Injured seven.

05:42.168 --> 05:45.171
A pipe bomb on a crowded city bus
and only two people are killed ?

05:45.218 --> 05:47.412
Had a relatively small charge.

05:47.617 --> 05:50.553
The two dead were found closest
to the bomb at the time of detonation.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.682
Sylvia Cohen,
an elderly passenger,

05:53.695 --> 05:55.802
found the umbrella
on the floor at her feet.

05:55.917 --> 05:58.883
She said the young man volunteered
to take it to the driver for her.

05:59.775 --> 06:01.640
She's pretty broken up about it.

06:01.655 --> 06:03.982
Have you vetted and debriefed
the rest of the passengers ?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.880
I have their info
if you want to talk to them.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.843
- Did you get their positions ?
- Sorry ?

06:07.955 --> 06:09.491
Where they were on the bus ?

06:10.066 --> 06:10.681
No.

06:11.525 --> 06:13.633
JJ, maybe you can recontact
the passengers

06:13.666 --> 06:16.031
- and map their locations.
- Yeah, you got it

06:16.326 --> 06:18.141
Nobody saw anyone leave the umbrella ?

06:18.248 --> 06:18.922
No.

06:19.757 --> 06:22.183
But, you know, from the style
it looks like a...

06:22.496 --> 06:24.922
remote detonator
on the corner over there.

06:25.026 --> 06:27.841
- You say remote ?
- Limited frequency remote.

06:28.197 --> 06:30.842
- Like a garage door opener ?
- Something like that.

06:30.856 --> 06:32.423
That's awfully risky.

06:32.597 --> 06:35.002
Anyone on this bus could have
accidentally detonated the bomb

06:35.017 --> 06:37.683
- just by pulling out of their garage.
- That's right.

07:08.145 --> 07:10.152
He used a remote
from the corner.

07:10.277 --> 07:12.492
Did he want to be close enough
to see what happened

07:12.525 --> 07:14.421
Or did he need to be mechanically ?

07:14.648 --> 07:17.233
Those remotes are pretty limited.
He probably needed to be.

07:17.268 --> 07:18.602
Then he might have been nervous.

07:18.626 --> 07:20.171
Maybe that made him stand out.

07:20.187 --> 07:22.751
I could set up a public service
announcement encouraging anyone

07:22.766 --> 07:25.753
who was in the area of the time
of the bombing to contact us.

07:26.788 --> 07:28.861
Well, we do need a press conference.

07:29.486 --> 07:32.572
But it'll be about
getting this unsub to call us.

07:33.285 --> 07:36.032
We're still trying to determine
what happened.

07:36.048 --> 07:37.912
Initial reports called it a bomb,

07:37.948 --> 07:39.892
but since no one
has claimed responsibility,

07:39.896 --> 07:42.512
we can't rule out
some kind of mechanical failure.

07:42.537 --> 07:44.502
Supervisory Special Agent Gideon

07:44.516 --> 07:47.192
will be handling 
any future communication

07:47.207 --> 07:49.893
on this incident.
If anyone has any information

07:49.915 --> 07:52.730
they feel might be helpful,
please contact S.S.A. Gideon

07:52.736 --> 07:54.710
at the number
appearing on your screen.

07:54.747 --> 07:57.650
<i>We will keep you posted
with future developments.</i>

07:57.667 --> 07:58.853
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:02.025 --> 08:03.371
Do you think that was enough ?

08:03.386 --> 08:06.113
It will definitely stress him
that his message isn't getting out.

08:06.128 --> 08:07.932
- What if he doesn't call ?
- Reid and Morgan

08:07.935 --> 08:10.671
are going over the device.
Maybe they'll come up with something.

08:15.998 --> 08:17.220
You know, Reid,

08:17.827 --> 08:20.691
the bomber could have bought
this detonator at any old toy store

08:21.407 --> 08:22.990
You take a remote control car,

08:23.106 --> 08:24.381
plane, boat,

08:24.866 --> 08:26.950
attach a detonator like this
to the motor,

08:27.485 --> 08:29.510
touch the remote,
boom !

08:30.037 --> 08:31.690
Instant fourth of july.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.506
How you doing ?
I'm Derek Morgan.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.745
This is dr.Spencer Reid.
We're with the B.A.U.

08:36.754 --> 08:39.706
Cassondra Atkins.
Cass or Cassy works, too.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.371
Bomb tech.

08:42.047 --> 08:44.612
- It's a really nice reconstruction.
- Oh, it wasn't that hard

08:44.625 --> 08:46.692
Explosive was limited
and the fragments

08:46.706 --> 08:48.982
were comparatively easy to locate.

08:49.348 --> 08:51.051
Okay so tell me what else
you got here ?

08:51.078 --> 08:53.930
Well, besides the light explosive load,
he used dry peas.

08:53.957 --> 08:55.163
Dry peas...

08:56.216 --> 08:59.253
He chose a shrapnel that wouldn't do
too much damage outside of a limited range.

08:59.275 --> 09:01.762
Why ? What's he doing,
trying to minimize his kills ?

09:01.776 --> 09:04.022
It also has a picture
engraved on it.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.933
It's a robot with an arrow
through it.

09:12.558 --> 09:13.872
Anti-robotics ?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.881
Doesn't the city center bus
stop use smart buses ?

09:16.897 --> 09:18.462
- Smart buses ?
- Yeah,

09:18.478 --> 09:20.702
Hi-tech buses that use time sensors on the buses

09:20.715 --> 09:22.781
and the bus stops to give out
arrival and departure times ?

09:22.796 --> 09:25.681
- Yeah. Went automated last year.
- So he's anti-technology.

09:25.857 --> 09:26.881
Maybe.

09:32.626 --> 09:33.711
Hey, dollface,

09:33.736 --> 09:36.112
<i>- ready to work somme magic for me ?</i>
- Challenge me,

09:36.125 --> 09:38.403
you beautiful, behavioral analyst.

09:38.555 --> 09:40.591
Domestic terrorist activity
in the Seattle area.

09:41.345 --> 09:42.520
<i>Morgan,</i>

09:42.657 --> 09:45.383
challenge me. Doesn't even raise
my blood pressure.

09:45.527 --> 09:48.330
Pacific Northwest is, like, ripe
with the disgruntled.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.211
You have animal rights,
zoning laws.

09:51.225 --> 09:54.562
- Specifically anti-technology ?
- Ahh, yes.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.653
My looney opposites.

09:57.078 --> 09:59.851
Here's something !
Month ago. Tacoma, Washington.

09:59.945 --> 10:03.202
disguised young guy went crazy
on a bunch of computers

10:03.385 --> 10:05.501
at a science lab, screaming,

10:05.517 --> 10:08.651
"we will soon be the slaves
and the machines will be the masters"

10:09.198 --> 10:10.392
Yikes.

10:10.405 --> 10:12.512
That would totally suck for me.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.912
I'm surrounded in here...

10:13.926 --> 10:16.611
Come on, what are you worried about ?
You got me to protect you.

10:17.736 --> 10:20.002
Now that gets my blood up.

10:20.415 --> 10:22.541
I'm uploading the video to you now.

10:26.955 --> 10:28.502
What else do you have, Garcia ?

10:28.516 --> 10:32.001
I also found an article in the
St Dennis university college newspaper.

10:32.018 --> 10:34.623
Last spring, close to the school,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.900
an Internet cafe was attacked.

10:36.918 --> 10:39.301
Someone created floppy disk bombs

10:39.317 --> 10:41.383
that went off in 4 of the computers.
No one was injured.

10:41.396 --> 10:43.333
Who uses floppy disks anymore ?

10:43.346 --> 10:45.562
Right, agent Brain,
that was the point of the attack.

10:45.576 --> 10:47.622
They left a note : "ultimately,
you'll be as obsolete

10:47.638 --> 10:49.383
as your graveyard technology".

10:49.397 --> 10:51.602
- Is the note signed ?
- "F. F. T. Brigade"

10:51.616 --> 10:54.973
<i>I'm finding references to a freedom
from technology brigade,</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:57.042
a fringe group
that's showing up lately.

10:57.098 --> 10:58.571
Anything else in the note ?

10:59.057 --> 11:02.201
Yeah. There's a not
very artistic drawing

11:02.207 --> 11:04.062
of what kind of looks like a...

11:04.397 --> 11:06.541
robot with an arrow through it.

11:06.695 --> 11:08.230
<i>I'm uploading it to you now.</i>

11:13.106 --> 11:14.652
You know, Seattle's the birthplace

11:14.667 --> 11:17.062
of some of the most cutting edge
technology in the world.

11:17.735 --> 11:19.601
Where it began.

11:20.228 --> 11:22.571
I think we're ready
to give a profile.

11:24.568 --> 11:26.773
We believe the unsub
resides in Seattle.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.831
All of the attacks, most of which
have just involved property damage,

11:30.348 --> 11:32.671
have taken place here,
and the timing and location

11:32.675 --> 11:34.432
indicate knowledge of the area.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.953
Even though he escalated
to a lethal bombing today,

11:37.016 --> 11:39.602
we don't believe that
that was necessarily his intention.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.242
In fact, anyone not directly
next to the device

11:42.247 --> 11:43.880
received minor injuries.

11:43.928 --> 11:46.161
So we think fear may have been
the larger motive.

11:46.187 --> 11:48.713
- So he's a terrorist then.
- He is, but...

11:48.775 --> 11:51.391
that's too vague of a description
for our purposes.

11:51.508 --> 11:54.753
Douglas and olshaker categorize
bombers as criminal,

11:54.846 --> 11:57.943
group cause,
psychologically disorganized, and...

11:58.005 --> 12:01.402
personal cause bombers. And we believe
this guy to be a personal cause bomber.

12:01.598 --> 12:05.102
And personal cause bombers are motivated
by an underlying emotional conflict.

12:05.148 --> 12:08.120
In an interview from prison,
the unabomber, Ted Kaczynksi,

12:08.136 --> 12:10.233
admitted that while
he was a graduate student

12:10.245 --> 12:13.992
at the university of Michigan, he started
having fantasies of becoming a woman.

12:14.007 --> 12:17.320
Even got on a list to get
a sex-change operation but,

12:17.507 --> 12:20.580
during a mandatory psychological
exam prior to the procedure,

12:20.586 --> 12:21.991
he changed his mind.

12:22.006 --> 12:24.012
He told the psychologist
that he made a mistake.

12:24.095 --> 12:25.733
From that moment

12:25.888 --> 12:28.252
through the next three decades
of his life,

12:28.268 --> 12:30.373
Ted Kaczynksi carried out
a campaign

12:30.388 --> 12:32.083
of isolation and murder.

12:32.117 --> 12:33.702
This unsub is male.

12:34.018 --> 12:35.411
He lives alone.

12:35.747 --> 12:37.532
He's possibly self-employed.

12:37.598 --> 12:39.791
He's highly organized.
He's meticulous.

12:40.076 --> 12:41.661
And he's very smart.

12:41.665 --> 12:44.653
And he seems odd to those
who know him. Angry,

12:45.106 --> 12:47.881
distant, prone to sudden
violent rage.

12:48.608 --> 12:50.773
This is not the kind of guy
whose neighbors will be surprised

12:50.788 --> 12:52.923
to find out what he's arrested for.
This guy's neighbors

12:52.937 --> 12:54.970
will have no trouble believing it.

12:55.077 --> 12:58.533
Targets appear to be technology,
but not the hi-tech variety.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.122
The kind of technology
we're surrounded by.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.662
In a city the size of Seattle,
we're talking

13:04.675 --> 13:06.712
10,000 possible targets.

13:07.447 --> 13:10.722
Agent Gideon, you got a call
on the tip line.

13:17.665 --> 13:19.102
Okay, go ahead.

13:19.468 --> 13:20.700
This is agent Gideon.

13:20.718 --> 13:23.202
Why did you say no one
took responsibility ?!

13:23.778 --> 13:25.560
- I'm sorry.
<i>- We called them all...</i>

13:25.808 --> 13:27.632
all the networks

13:27.735 --> 13:30.241
before anything happened.
They didn't tell anyone ?

13:30.296 --> 13:32.290
Well, the networks
are incompetent if...

13:32.418 --> 13:34.852
you need to get your message out
or you have a demand,

13:34.868 --> 13:37.531
I'm in a much better position 
to do that for you

13:38.036 --> 13:39.562
<i>You have a name, sir ?</i>

13:39.747 --> 13:41.652
We're the F.F.T. Brigade.

13:41.668 --> 13:44.012
No No No I mean you
specifically. What...

13:44.418 --> 13:45.732
what can I call you ?

13:45.858 --> 13:48.673
This is not about individuals.
F.F.T.'s a major organization.

13:48.687 --> 13:51.353
<i>- we have hundreds of members.</i>
- But you... you have a name.

13:52.588 --> 13:54.303
You may call me Allegro.

13:54.565 --> 13:56.263
So, Allegro, let's meet somewhere

13:56.287 --> 13:58.301
We can talk about your message...

13:58.957 --> 14:01.150
- try to help you...
<i>- If the networks won't get our message out,</i>

14:01.168 --> 14:03.492
then it is up to you.
It's your responsibility.

14:03.626 --> 14:06.100
So call this number. They'll put you
through to me immediately.

14:06.206 --> 14:07.953
I won't need to call again.

14:07.968 --> 14:09.711
My message will be here
when you arrive.

14:09.728 --> 14:11.951
I'm sorry, when I arrive ?

14:17.327 --> 14:18.670
What's that ?

14:18.948 --> 14:20.021
<i>Allegro ?</i>

14:20.695 --> 14:21.920
<i>Hello ?</i>

14:22.148 --> 14:23.200
<i>Allegro ?</i>

14:50.546 --> 14:52.012
Can you smell that ?

14:53.085 --> 14:55.072
Same explosive, just more of it.

14:55.085 --> 14:57.291
Yeah. And same
detonation device, too.

14:57.545 --> 15:00.543
The gas station closed 15 minutes
prior to the explosion.

15:00.556 --> 15:03.330
Fortunately, the worker
had already gone home.

15:03.356 --> 15:06.140
No casualties, an escalation
in the size of the explosion,

15:06.156 --> 15:08.482
and a decrease
in the number of victims

15:09.238 --> 15:11.370
We need to do a grid search
as soon as possible.

15:11.397 --> 15:13.342
What do I tell them
we're looking for ?

15:13.817 --> 15:16.703
Said his message would be here
when we arrived.

15:35.675 --> 15:36.972
Clear !

15:39.526 --> 15:40.882
It's a book.

15:44.698 --> 15:46.643
It says,"manifesto".

15:46.655 --> 15:48.033
Bag it.

15:52.455 --> 15:54.493
His manifesto's main demand is

15:54.497 --> 15:57.553
completely unrealistic :
stop all automated machinery

15:57.568 --> 15:59.423
that's replaced american workers

15:59.586 --> 16:01.621
- within a week.
- And if his demands aren't met,

16:01.637 --> 16:03.563
he says he'll detonate
even larger bombs

16:03.575 --> 16:06.300
So we have an anti-technology bomber
who so far has attacked

16:06.346 --> 16:09.343
computers, an automated cashier,
an automated gas station,

16:09.356 --> 16:12.190
- and a smart bus.
- Who calls himself Allegro.

16:12.558 --> 16:13.691
What was that ?

16:13.725 --> 16:15.370
He told me to call him allegro.

16:15.805 --> 16:17.280
Of course.

16:17.315 --> 16:19.531
- Yeah, it's a book.
- Yeah, it ought to be.

16:19.566 --> 16:22.713
No, no It's an actual book,
a novel I read it as a kid.

16:22.727 --> 16:25.843
It's called "Empty Planet" by
one-hit-wonder author David Hansberry.

16:25.855 --> 16:28.600
It's got it all : technoids, minutians.
All that stuff's in there.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.750
It's robots that take
over the world

16:30.768 --> 16:32.872
once they figure out
how to reproduce with humans.

16:32.888 --> 16:35.910
Essentially, humanity's lost to
technology and the hero of the book

16:35.935 --> 16:37.670
is a 12-year-old boy named Allegro

16:37.687 --> 16:39.800
who builds an army
and fights for the humans.

16:39.818 --> 16:42.080
Morgan, have Garcia get
as much information as possible

16:42.088 --> 16:44.313
on the author of "Empty Planet".
David Hansberry ?

16:44.445 --> 16:45.703
Hansberry, yeah.

16:45.806 --> 16:46.953
I'm on it.

16:47.346 --> 16:49.200
There was a passenger
on the bus yesterday,

16:49.215 --> 16:52.280
a Dr. Emory Cooke. He's supposed
to be some kind of computer genius,

16:52.315 --> 16:54.145
- pioneer in artificial life.
- Yeah, Cooke.

16:54.145 --> 16:56.631
He developed software that mirrors
the human reproductive system.

16:56.656 --> 16:58.740
Computers that can
replicate themselves.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.970
So maybe Cooke was the target
and not the smart bus.

17:00.997 --> 17:03.700
If so, that would definitely be
imitating events from the book.

17:03.906 --> 17:06.180
Allegro and his army not only
destroyed robots,

17:06.194 --> 17:09.333
but they assassinate the scientists
that are responsible for creating them.

17:09.465 --> 17:11.693
Dr. Cooke was sitting right
in front of Sylvia Cohen.

17:11.704 --> 17:14.762
And the umbrella was initially found
underneath Dr. Cooke's seat.

17:14.916 --> 17:15.981
Yeah.

17:16.837 --> 17:18.961
Thank you for coming
so quickly, dr. Cooke.

17:19.295 --> 17:22.233
People, particularly
some religious fundamentalists,

17:22.457 --> 17:24.103
oppose the work you do.

17:24.275 --> 17:26.342
Do you receive
any threatening letters

17:26.357 --> 17:28.131
or phone calls from anyone
about your work ?

17:28.295 --> 17:28.893
Never.

17:29.087 --> 17:29.703
Really ?

17:29.857 --> 17:31.540
I've managed to put to rest

17:31.755 --> 17:34.471
certain anxieties
about the godlessness of

17:34.578 --> 17:37.981
artificial life by openly sharing
my own personal beliefs.

17:38.388 --> 17:39.182
Which are ?

17:39.225 --> 17:42.681
No scientific knowledge precludes
the existence of God.

17:43.057 --> 17:44.481
There are also those with...

17:44.526 --> 17:46.281
very strong ethical concerns.

17:46.356 --> 17:49.153
Ethical concerns revolve mainly around

17:49.278 --> 17:52.801
the manipulation of already-existing
life forms.

17:52.937 --> 17:54.720
My work is on creating

17:54.776 --> 17:55.933
artificial life,

17:55.985 --> 17:58.672
which presents far less ethical dilemma.

17:59.025 --> 18:01.781
Not from the man that put the bomb
on the bus yesterday.

18:02.227 --> 18:04.461
He seems to be obsessed
with the science fiction novel

18:04.476 --> 18:06.823
by David Hansberry
called "Empty Planet".

18:07.267 --> 18:08.632
Are you familiar with the book ?

18:08.697 --> 18:10.252
I'm from friends with the author.

18:13.497 --> 18:15.303
The author of the "Empty Planet"

18:15.407 --> 18:18.281
used David Hansberry
as a pseudonym.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.022
Come on, Garcia, I know you got his name,
so give it up.

18:21.155 --> 18:22.170
<i>Her name,</i>

18:22.217 --> 18:24.421
you cute little chauvinist,
is Ursula Kent,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.053
and she's a literature professor at...

18:27.438 --> 18:28.462
oh, my...

18:28.475 --> 18:30.360
<i>In seattle, st Dennis university.</i>

18:30.377 --> 18:32.091
Where the floppy disc bombs
were set.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.952
Oh, you are the light of my life,
sweet lady.

18:34.966 --> 18:37.182
Je suis toujours ici pour toi, mon cher.

18:37.197 --> 18:39.841
Drives me crazy when you talk
that "voulez coucher" stuff to me.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.373
<i>Stop it !
Au revoir, crazy girl.</i>

18:42.558 --> 18:44.452
Ursula Kent is a brilliant woman.

18:44.486 --> 18:46.661
She's a post-modernist
literature professor.

18:46.807 --> 18:49.530
Every semester I give a guest lecture
in her class.

18:50.135 --> 18:51.271
She... she's here ?

18:51.667 --> 18:52.842
In Seattle ?

18:52.925 --> 18:54.581
Is that not what I just said ?

18:58.586 --> 19:01.221
Sir, this guy reads "Empty Planet"
like it's prophecy.

19:02.047 --> 19:05.242
He's targeting what he considers threats
to the survival of human beings,

19:05.255 --> 19:08.471
and I believe that he finds you
one of these threats, Dr. Cooke.

19:08.775 --> 19:09.883
As I've said,

19:09.945 --> 19:11.441
I rather doubt that.

19:11.536 --> 19:13.463
Do you think the fact
that you were on that bus

19:13.476 --> 19:16.172
and you're friends with the author
is a coincidence ?

19:16.218 --> 19:19.232
A cognitive scientist at M.I.T.
once said :

19:19.288 --> 19:21.062
"Coincidences seem to be
the source

19:21.077 --> 19:23.420
for some of our greatest irrationalities".

19:24.726 --> 19:27.491
- Our minds see coincidences and...
- I understood him.

19:27.908 --> 19:30.382
I'd like to attach a protective detail
for you, Dr. Cooke,

19:30.407 --> 19:31.692
until we find the guy.

19:31.747 --> 19:33.153
No, thank you.

19:33.467 --> 19:35.263
- Excuse me ?
- Really, now.

19:35.537 --> 19:37.751
Do I seem like the sort who would want
to be followed around

19:37.766 --> 19:40.163
all day by a government goon squad ?

19:41.225 --> 19:42.521
I don't think so.

19:46.976 --> 19:48.232
Goon squad ?

19:49.425 --> 19:51.583
Ever talk to someone who wants
to continually show you

19:51.587 --> 19:53.053
he's smarter than you ?

19:54.167 --> 19:55.522
Everyday.

19:55.578 --> 19:56.892
I really hate that.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.673
Garcia found the author of the book.

19:58.695 --> 20:00.463
David Hansberry's just a pen name.

20:00.488 --> 20:01.781
- The real name is...
- Ursula Kent.

20:01.795 --> 20:04.030
The professor of post-modern literature
at St. Dennis university

20:04.048 --> 20:05.760
where the floppy disc bombs
were sent.

20:06.855 --> 20:09.210
Anyway, JJ's contacting her,
we can go see her any time.

20:09.298 --> 20:10.170
Let's go.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.343
We need to stop by a bookstore
and get a copy of "Empty Planet".

20:12.355 --> 20:14.203
I want to re-read before we talk to the author.

20:14.216 --> 20:16.151
- I haven't read it since I was 6.
- 6 ?

20:16.447 --> 20:18.631
I was still ridin'by big wheel
at 6 years old.

20:18.645 --> 20:20.993
- Do you mind ? It'll only take 10 minutes.
- To buy it or read it ?

20:21.006 --> 20:22.563
Oh, both, actually.

20:22.588 --> 20:25.142
Have agent Casey set up protection
for Dr. Cooke.

20:25.505 --> 20:27.592
Like him or not, he's in danger.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.990
He used a compression detonator.

21:14.047 --> 21:15.513
Looks like it was under the seat.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.273
Once he sat down, it arms.

21:17.287 --> 21:19.622
Detonated when he released
the pressure by getting up.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.162
He wanted to make sure
nothing went wrong this time.

21:22.355 --> 21:24.200
Nobody moved the umbrella.

21:25.335 --> 21:27.333
Hotch, Gideon just talked
to this guy.

21:27.546 --> 21:29.723
Offered him security but he refused.

21:29.785 --> 21:31.550
We were gonna set it up anyway.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.202
I doubt it would have helped.

21:33.218 --> 21:34.402
What do you mean ?

21:34.505 --> 21:35.962
Compression detonator.

21:35.976 --> 21:38.432
It had to have been set when he was with us or it
would have detonated

21:38.447 --> 21:40.153
when he arrived at the field office.

21:40.186 --> 21:43.352
I'll get security to start running
tapes of the lot for the last 2 hours.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.393
Good.

21:49.566 --> 21:50.420
Gideon.

21:50.945 --> 21:53.230
I'm glad no one but Dr Cooke was hurt.

21:54.928 --> 21:56.690
Dr Cooke wasn't hurt.

21:57.295 --> 21:58.482
He was murdered.

21:58.496 --> 22:00.362
Murder is not murder during war.

22:00.375 --> 22:03.163
But this... this isn't a war.
You're... you're...

22:03.707 --> 22:05.281
you're livin'a novel,

22:05.295 --> 22:06.890
You're livin'a fiction.

22:06.895 --> 22:08.922
- Will you meet my demands ?
<i>- I can't...</i>

22:08.935 --> 22:11.703
Stopping all automation at a week,
you know that's impossible.

22:11.907 --> 22:13.540
And I want my manifesto printed

22:13.548 --> 22:17.340
- in the Seattle Ledger by tonight.
- Not the New York Times, Washington Post ?

22:18.086 --> 22:20.173
Somebody in Seattle important to you ?

22:23.058 --> 22:25.092
There's more work to be done.
Much, much more.

22:25.105 --> 22:27.273
In fact, I'm going to visit
an old acquaintance right now.

22:27.286 --> 22:30.322
I'd invite you, but you're all going
to be very busy.

22:31.167 --> 22:32.200
Got it.

22:32.207 --> 22:34.231
It was the last copy left,
according to the clerk,

22:34.247 --> 22:37.742
it's actually become a pretty popular novel
in science fiction circles.

22:37.768 --> 22:38.480
Hotch.

22:38.498 --> 22:40.652
A suspicious package was found
at the water works.

22:40.666 --> 22:43.600
The report says it looks like a pipe bomb,
We're on our way there now.

22:43.635 --> 22:45.390
Ok, keep me posted.

22:45.408 --> 22:47.302
Unsub says we're gonna be busy.

22:47.317 --> 22:48.453
Got it.

22:49.265 --> 22:51.320
Looks like a pipe bomb at the water works.

22:51.347 --> 22:52.943
Are we gonna go there ?

22:52.957 --> 22:56.062
No, we'll still go see professor Kent.

22:56.277 --> 22:57.603
Seatbelts.

23:01.825 --> 23:03.590
Hello. Ursula Kent.

23:03.637 --> 23:07.012
Hi. My pleasure, professor Kent.
Jason Gideon, FBI.

23:07.027 --> 23:08.281
This is Dr. Reid

23:08.308 --> 23:10.342
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
I'm a fan of your work.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.643
Well, that's very nice of you to say.

23:12.765 --> 23:15.051
- We can speak in my office.
- Lead the way.

23:17.775 --> 23:21.290
Your book has become a significant
part of our investigation.

23:21.425 --> 23:23.012
So your colleague explained.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.682
I can't imagine how, though.

23:24.846 --> 23:27.931
Bomber sees it is some kind
of prophetic work.

23:28.136 --> 23:30.201
He's attempting to save humanity

23:30.215 --> 23:32.992
by stopping the proliferation
of robotic technology.

23:33.008 --> 23:34.532
Well, that's absurd.

23:34.536 --> 23:36.332
He's written a document-like manifesto

23:36.348 --> 23:39.340
called a guide to practical living,
and several sections of it are lifted

23:39.355 --> 23:41.290
directly from "Empty Planet".

23:41.348 --> 23:44.630
He's taken up what he believes
to be your cause and...

23:45.285 --> 23:47.833
he's killing people for the sake of it.

23:50.107 --> 23:53.022
But "Empty Planet" is a fantasy.

23:53.398 --> 23:54.960
Not to this man.

23:55.127 --> 23:57.191
How could anyone think
it's more than that ?

23:57.227 --> 23:59.650
Unfortunately, it's impossible
to predict how an unstable mind

23:59.655 --> 24:01.470
will interpret something.

24:01.497 --> 24:03.760
And it's caused him to kill people ?

24:06.426 --> 24:08.510
Do you know a Dr Emory Cooke ?

24:08.548 --> 24:10.372
- Very well.
- He spoke to your classes ?

24:10.387 --> 24:11.102
Yes

24:11.885 --> 24:14.692
Dr. Cooke was murdered by the bomber
an hour ago.

24:19.016 --> 24:19.691
No.

24:24.236 --> 24:25.311
Clear !

24:27.248 --> 24:30.143
It's safe now,
just another small charge.

24:30.158 --> 24:32.082
More meant to scare than to harm.

24:35.868 --> 24:37.863
Definitely the same unsub.

24:37.868 --> 24:39.330
Same signature.

24:39.416 --> 24:40.413
Casey.

24:41.657 --> 24:43.481
We'll get there ASAP.

24:44.056 --> 24:46.311
There's another bomb at the post office.

24:46.406 --> 24:47.812
Let's go.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.721
Professor, what is that ?

24:56.476 --> 24:58.681
this is something someone...

24:58.898 --> 25:02.181
a brilliant man gave me a long time ago
before he died.

25:02.815 --> 25:05.390
Actually, it's part of the inspiration

25:05.395 --> 25:06.701
for "Empty Planet".

25:06.737 --> 25:08.542
James was a rather early alarmist

25:08.556 --> 25:11.571
about how much we were letting technology

25:11.838 --> 25:13.571
control our lives.

25:13.585 --> 25:16.293
It's become a sort of talisman for me.

25:16.476 --> 25:18.160
You wear it when you teach ?

25:18.278 --> 25:19.970
Sometimes, yes.

25:23.778 --> 25:26.283
This has been etched
on the bomber's devices.

25:27.948 --> 25:30.600
Oh, my God !

25:31.237 --> 25:33.862
Bomber's written a manifesto
he wants published,

25:33.875 --> 25:35.701
but not in the national newspaper.

25:35.715 --> 25:38.410
He wants it published
in the Seattle Ledger.

25:39.068 --> 25:41.120
He wants someone here to read it.

25:41.136 --> 25:44.413
Have you ever had a student you think might
be capable of doing something like this ?

25:44.426 --> 25:47.121
One of my students ?
Someone who hates technology ?

25:47.137 --> 25:49.120
I'm a post-modernist.

25:49.695 --> 25:52.222
In my area of study,
technological inventions

25:52.227 --> 25:54.543
are often viewed as art objects.

25:54.558 --> 25:56.962
That's true, but oftentimes
the biggest critics of technology

25:56.975 --> 25:59.071
are those with scientific backgrounds, and...

25:59.085 --> 26:02.293
- your students definitely fit that category.
- I need you to read this.

26:03.148 --> 26:05.603
Tell me if the writing seems
at all familiar to you.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.463
We'll wait.

26:14.747 --> 26:15.512
Morgan.

26:15.527 --> 26:18.171
Gideon, this guy's pissing me off
right about now

26:18.177 --> 26:21.072
This is the fourth location
in the last 50 minutes.

26:21.195 --> 26:23.013
All of them have been very small bombs.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.812
<i>- What kind of locations ?</i>
- Municipal Water works,

26:25.836 --> 26:27.292
main post office,

26:27.338 --> 26:30.261
social security office, and now
we're at the main branch of the library.

26:30.276 --> 26:31.533
<i>Government buildings.</i>

26:31.556 --> 26:33.933
- Nothing involving technology.
- No, nothing.

26:33.975 --> 26:35.512
<i>Then what's the purpose ?</i>

26:35.547 --> 26:37.611
Distract us, keep us movin'.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.382
<i>He's doing a damn good job,
gideon, I don't like this at all.</i>

26:40.518 --> 26:43.443
We're chasing this guy,
We gotta do somethin'to get ahead of him.

26:43.455 --> 26:45.801
Professor Kent is reading the manifesto.

26:46.045 --> 26:48.270
I hope she reads as fast as Reid.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.653
No one reads as fast as Reid.

26:59.905 --> 27:01.900
Is this the syllabus for your class ?

27:02.797 --> 27:05.243
- Yes
- Is it the same every semester ?

27:05.256 --> 27:07.353
Mostly, maybe a book
or project changed.

27:07.365 --> 27:09.392
You only have two guest lecturers listed.

27:09.425 --> 27:12.212
Yes... Dr. Cooke and Dr. Brasier.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.241
I always have those two,
they're the only two I invite.

27:15.276 --> 27:16.863
They speak to every new class.

27:16.877 --> 27:19.683
Dr. Cooke is... was...

27:20.497 --> 27:22.441
an expert on artificial life,

27:22.465 --> 27:24.543
- and Dr. Brasier...
- Artificial intelligence.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.310
Dr. Brasier have an office on campus ?

27:26.348 --> 27:29.591
No, it's cross town at Rolling Hills.

27:34.746 --> 27:36.663
Morgan, I may have something.

27:41.375 --> 27:42.411
Hey, Shelly,

27:42.876 --> 27:45.002
I'm on my way to the symposium now.

27:46.056 --> 27:47.713
Then save me a seat.

27:48.257 --> 27:49.622
It's not rude.

27:50.175 --> 27:52.470
Fine, then tell them a V.I.P. is coming

27:52.487 --> 27:54.880
and you'll lose your job
if you don't save the seat.

27:54.975 --> 27:56.780
How long ago did her assistant say she left ?

27:56.796 --> 27:59.271
- Minutes
- Good, maybe she's not in the car yet.

28:00.715 --> 28:01.652
Yeah.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.790
Me, Shelly. I'm the VIP.

28:08.557 --> 28:10.080
Yes, I am.

28:10.746 --> 28:13.400
- I don't care what you tell them.
- Stop the car !

28:13.418 --> 28:16.092
This is long as I can see,
I'm tired and I need a seat.

28:16.106 --> 28:18.662
Stop the car, ma'am !
Stop the car !

28:19.337 --> 28:22.560
Listen to me, Do not touch the ignition.
Put the car in park.

28:22.575 --> 28:25.522
Ma'am, put the car in park,
don't touch the ignition.

28:26.488 --> 28:27.860
Don't panic.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.010
- I'm FBI.
- FBI ?

28:30.185 --> 28:32.171
- Dr. Brasier ?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Brasier.

28:32.526 --> 28:35.190
- It's her.
- Girl, let me call you back.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.113
Doctor, do not move.

28:39.115 --> 28:40.932
- Excuse me ?
- I need you to sit

28:40.945 --> 28:43.261
as still as you can, please.

28:49.855 --> 28:50.911
Damn.

28:54.606 --> 28:56.732
Doctor, listen carefully.

28:57.035 --> 29:00.530
You must sit as still as you
possibly can, you understand ?

29:00.815 --> 29:01.910
Why ?

29:01.956 --> 29:04.380
There is a bomb under your seat.

29:12.407 --> 29:14.262
- Be good.
- Wait.

29:15.555 --> 29:17.812
Be of good courage and...

29:18.035 --> 29:20.642
he will strengthen thine heart.

29:21.376 --> 29:22.841
Doctor,

29:24.676 --> 29:26.422
you're gonna be just fine.

29:28.438 --> 29:30.643
He will strengthen thine heart

29:31.528 --> 29:34.113
Every device this guy has
made has been fairly basic

29:34.127 --> 29:35.860
I'm guessing this is a simple...

29:35.875 --> 29:38.071
lever action compression detonator.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.762
Kinda like a door latch.

29:39.766 --> 29:41.992
When you use this,
put it between the latch

29:42.005 --> 29:44.593
and the seat bottom
to depress the latch,

29:44.606 --> 29:46.252
and I think we should be ok

29:46.277 --> 29:48.083
- Should ?
- Well,

29:48.097 --> 29:50.351
if there's mercury, we got problems.

29:59.486 --> 30:00.841
Thanks, Hotch.

30:00.846 --> 30:02.651
Yeah, I'm right here.

30:03.695 --> 30:06.561
- So ?
- Bomb tech's just about ready.

30:06.665 --> 30:10.271
- Maybe we should get over there
- No, I think we would just be in the way

30:10.627 --> 30:13.640
- What about Morgan ?
- He hasn't changed his mind.

30:16.585 --> 30:17.720
Morgan ?

30:17.725 --> 30:20.280
I'm ordering you to step away
from the car.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.132
Hotch, you know I respect you

30:23.695 --> 30:25.192
I'm not leavin'her

30:31.277 --> 30:33.111
You should listen to your friends.

30:35.845 --> 30:37.453
Don't do that.

30:37.457 --> 30:39.902
Don't you turn on me, doc.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.681
I'm right here with you.

30:44.295 --> 30:45.350
Got it ?

30:47.616 --> 30:48.690
Okay ?

30:49.225 --> 30:51.560
My girl is using one of my hands

30:53.055 --> 30:55.240
- Now, Cassie.
- Yeah ?

30:55.257 --> 30:57.532
You might need the other one,
so come on.

30:57.535 --> 31:00.101
Do what you gotta do, let's do this.

31:00.695 --> 31:02.090
Step back.

31:07.276 --> 31:08.860
Thank you.

31:10.467 --> 31:13.073
Aside from the sections of my novel

31:13.085 --> 31:14.831
that were blatantly plagiarized,

31:14.846 --> 31:16.710
I didn't recognize anything.

31:16.798 --> 31:19.803
It's just page after page
of the ravings of a lunatic.

31:23.677 --> 31:26.061
Right now, a young man
I greatly respect and admire

31:26.076 --> 31:29.601
is putting his life on the line
because of that lunatic.

31:31.047 --> 31:33.902
I'll look through it again.

31:34.245 --> 31:35.871
Thank you

31:38.386 --> 31:40.373
You're gonna be just fine.

32:05.217 --> 32:08.483
Wait on the lord, I say.

32:27.925 --> 32:29.383
That was lucky.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.873
Yeah, this time.

32:34.738 --> 32:36.260
Yeah, they're ok

32:38.317 --> 32:40.181
Now blow the car up.

32:41.496 --> 32:43.232
You're blowing it up ?

32:44.827 --> 32:47.383
Best way to keep
Dr Brasier safe is...

32:47.495 --> 32:50.353
by letting the bomber think
he was successful in killing her.

32:51.008 --> 32:53.602
Neighbors will hear an explosion,
it'll be on the news.

32:53.617 --> 32:55.780
You have a complicated life.

32:56.936 --> 32:58.603
Complicated world.

33:01.025 --> 33:02.802
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

33:02.826 --> 33:04.550
Yeah, me, too.

33:06.826 --> 33:09.661
Give the manifesto a little more thought.
Maybe something will occur to you

33:09.677 --> 33:11.960
without the pressure of us
looming over you.

33:11.997 --> 33:13.993
You could go back over
your student list.

33:14.006 --> 33:15.663
Think about the males.

33:15.807 --> 33:17.751
Anything odd about them.

33:17.886 --> 33:19.623
Guy probably had a temper.

33:19.886 --> 33:22.981
Something... you maybe haven't thought
about for years.

33:23.007 --> 33:25.713
I'll have my T.A. pull the files.

33:26.008 --> 33:27.663
May I ask you something, ma'am ?

33:27.706 --> 33:29.030
Of course.

33:29.596 --> 33:31.623
Why didn't you ever write
another book ?

33:33.816 --> 33:36.483
I guess it was the only story
I needed to tell.

33:39.077 --> 33:41.120
I'll be working in my office
most of the night,

33:41.138 --> 33:42.823
don't hesitate to call.

33:44.237 --> 33:45.213
Thank you.

33:46.176 --> 33:47.743
- Have a good night.
- You too.

34:14.206 --> 34:16.632
Melissa, I need you to pull the file

34:16.655 --> 34:20.170
and thesis paper of a student
from last year.

34:20.946 --> 34:23.873
Yeah, his name is Kenneth Roberts.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.201
Great, thanks.

34:49.476 --> 34:52.610
So it begins with the father's suicide.

34:52.905 --> 34:55.793
Okay we got 5 crime scenes'worth
of new information to go through.

34:55.797 --> 34:58.430
And the targets that the unsub chose
for the decoy bombs

34:58.446 --> 34:59.970
do they force a change in the profile ?

34:59.986 --> 35:01.572
I don't think so, I think they are
what they are

35:01.587 --> 35:03.832
Decoys to throw us off the trail
of Dr Brasier.

35:03.868 --> 35:06.622
- Reid, what's that ?
- It's the subplot of the Empty Planet book.

35:06.657 --> 35:09.142
- Allegro kills his mother ?
- Yeah, at the end,

35:09.158 --> 35:11.781
he discovers he's adopted,
he's reunited with his birth mom.

35:11.815 --> 35:14.970
He thanks her for having the strength
to give him a better life, but...

35:15.237 --> 35:18.591
ironically, he realizes that
she herself has become a robot,

35:18.617 --> 35:20.373
so he kills her.

35:20.388 --> 35:22.073
He sacrifices the one person
in the world

35:22.086 --> 35:24.573
he has a biological connection
with for the greater good.

35:25.856 --> 35:28.411
I thought we were talking about
some geeky sci-fi book here.

35:28.418 --> 35:31.800
- That sounds like greek tragedy.
- It's not played as a tragedy at all though.

35:31.826 --> 35:34.200
In fact, his mother's incredibly
proud of this final act,

35:34.218 --> 35:37.291
like it's the ultimate fulfillment
of his destiny, proof that...

35:37.306 --> 35:39.811
proof that she was right
to have given him up in the first place.

35:39.817 --> 35:42.042
Wait a minute, If he kills her,
how do you know she was proud ?

35:42.055 --> 35:45.032
It's told from her point of view,
the whole book is.

35:45.035 --> 35:47.703
It's kind of like she's talking
to the reader from heaven

35:47.715 --> 35:49.512
Mother's the narrator.

35:49.527 --> 35:52.012
Yeah it's really her story.

35:52.037 --> 35:53.962
Only story she needed to tell.

35:54.037 --> 35:56.113
And in order to fulfill the story,

35:56.158 --> 35:57.911
he's gotta kill his mother.

35:59.995 --> 36:01.973
Don't hate the book

36:01.987 --> 36:04.551
Without this, I never would have known you at all.

36:07.326 --> 36:08.503
Mother.

36:17.957 --> 36:20.021
Kenneth, did you do this ?

36:20.675 --> 36:23.083
Did you kill Dr Cooke ?

36:23.388 --> 36:25.090
You've read my manifesto.

36:25.688 --> 36:27.041
Yes, and...

36:27.057 --> 36:29.380
I thought some things seemed familiar.

36:29.397 --> 36:31.872
And I know why you wrote "Empty Planet".

36:33.205 --> 36:35.182
I know what you've been trying to say.

36:36.908 --> 36:38.270
Kenneth,

36:39.937 --> 36:41.993
you've misunderstood.

36:42.455 --> 36:45.670
I don't... think so.

36:51.847 --> 36:53.083
Kenneth,

36:54.065 --> 36:56.942
the book is a work of fiction.

36:56.945 --> 36:58.870
- The book is a gift !
- No, it isn't.

36:58.886 --> 37:00.252
It's just a story.

37:00.265 --> 37:02.662
Then let me tell you a story, professor !

37:04.715 --> 37:06.532
My mother died when I was eight.

37:08.505 --> 37:11.702
And then several years ago,
my father needed a blood transfusion.

37:11.706 --> 37:13.642
And I tried to donate,
only to discover

37:13.655 --> 37:16.163
that we had nothing genetically
in common.

37:16.666 --> 37:18.760
I had to watch him wither away,

37:18.777 --> 37:21.502
but before he died,
he told me I was adopted.

37:22.278 --> 37:23.873
This is not what you think.

37:23.885 --> 37:26.223
I needed to find my mother,
but the records were sealed.

37:26.237 --> 37:27.832
All I knew was that...

37:28.216 --> 37:30.023
I was adopted in Youngstown,

37:30.048 --> 37:31.083
Ohio.

37:34.705 --> 37:37.261
And then I came across
an article about...

37:37.436 --> 37:39.390
professor Ursula Kent.

37:40.668 --> 37:42.453
Favorite daughter of youngstown,

37:42.468 --> 37:44.420
famous writer of "Empty Planet",

37:44.435 --> 37:46.282
and do you know, do you know,

37:46.286 --> 37:48.542
what that article said ?

37:49.345 --> 37:50.813
It... it said

37:52.347 --> 37:54.361
that you had given up
a baby for adoption

37:54.376 --> 37:57.292
and that baby was the inspiration
for the book.

37:57.298 --> 37:58.502
That is true.

37:58.506 --> 38:00.971
That is true, but that is not
the whole story.

38:18.976 --> 38:21.552
When did you give up your baby
for adoption ?

38:23.057 --> 38:25.112
Wasn't it 26 years ago ?

38:27.028 --> 38:29.222
In Youngstown, Ohio ?

38:31.148 --> 38:32.191
Go, go !

38:32.207 --> 38:33.611
Kenneth, listen to me.

38:33.628 --> 38:34.423
No !

38:35.567 --> 38:37.231
It's your turn to listen.

38:43.927 --> 38:45.141
Come on !

39:00.705 --> 39:03.042
I came out here to take your class.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.722
For a year, I sat right there.

39:06.017 --> 39:08.983
Right there !
And you never saw me !

39:08.985 --> 39:11.471
- How could you not recognize me ?
- If you'd just come to me,

39:11.485 --> 39:13.000
- I could've explained...
- Then I realized,

39:13.015 --> 39:16.050
the only way to get you to see me was
to live out the book, But guess what ?

39:16.068 --> 39:18.613
I did that and now,

39:18.718 --> 39:21.083
you see me, don't you ?

39:21.168 --> 39:24.043
- This is our destiny !
- Morgan, stairs, Go around.

39:27.097 --> 39:28.803
The baby I gave up,

39:28.878 --> 39:30.360
it was a girl.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.402
It was a daughter.

39:37.307 --> 39:39.051
- That's a lie.
- It was a girl.

39:39.068 --> 39:41.682
- That's a lie !
- I'm so sorry.

39:41.698 --> 39:43.860
- I know the pain you're in.
- Why do you keep

39:43.876 --> 39:46.601
- lying to me ?!
- You're not my son !

39:48.115 --> 39:51.290
I promise I will do everything
I can to help you find your birth.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.353
- Stop it !
- Allegro !

39:54.435 --> 39:57.062
- I have a bomb !
- Wait !

39:57.945 --> 39:59.181
Wait !

40:00.458 --> 40:02.243
Please wait.

40:04.745 --> 40:06.033
Don't want to hurt anyone

40:06.035 --> 40:08.291
You've gone to great lengths not
to hurt anyone unintentionally...

40:08.306 --> 40:10.460
- Leave us alone !
- No, we can't do that, Allegro.

40:10.475 --> 40:12.162
We cannot leave you alone.

40:12.237 --> 40:15.300
Okay, listen,
I'm... I'm... I'm okay.

40:15.327 --> 40:16.223
Doesn't have to end this way

40:16.237 --> 40:18.383
- This is how it ends !
- You can change the ending.

40:18.386 --> 40:20.373
- This is how it ends !
- How does it begin ?

40:20.388 --> 40:21.362
I don't even know the story,

40:21.377 --> 40:23.021
- tell me the story.
- You don't know the story !

40:23.035 --> 40:25.082
I wanna know who you are,
Are you in the story, Allegro ?

40:25.095 --> 40:27.663
- Start the story !
- Leave us alone !

40:36.965 --> 40:39.400
Get an ambulance,
get him out of here.

40:40.797 --> 40:42.721
It's your shoulder.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.081
He's lost, He's just lost

40:46.095 --> 40:47.791
Just relax.

40:47.806 --> 40:49.310
It'll be all right.

40:49.695 --> 40:51.470
Can't blame him.

40:51.967 --> 40:53.891
Your eyes, Ursula,
I wanna see your eyes.

40:53.905 --> 40:55.993
Here they are.
There you go.

40:56.756 --> 40:59.441
- You're listening ?
- I'm listening.

40:59.595 --> 41:01.840
He just wants to know who he is.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.253
That's all.

41:03.288 --> 41:04.692
I understand.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.301
Open those eyes, there you go.

41:07.716 --> 41:09.530
Right, Keep looking at me.

41:09.537 --> 41:11.242
It's gonna be all right.

41:12.888 --> 41:14.182
Just relax.

41:20.905 --> 41:23.163
- I'll be right back.
- Do not cheat.

41:26.207 --> 41:29.100
JJ, a lot of science fiction's
deeper than you might think.

41:29.855 --> 41:33.561
- There are some genuine human emotions...
- Yeah, let me save you the time, Reid.

41:33.788 --> 41:36.642
I am never going to Comicon with you.

41:37.637 --> 41:39.402
- I...
- Gin.

41:42.438 --> 41:43.862
What, you don't trust me ?

41:44.078 --> 41:46.641
- Come on.
- Let's just make sure.

41:47.127 --> 41:49.203
It's fun beating a genius.

41:49.218 --> 41:51.770
Genius Dr Reid let you win.

41:58.925 --> 42:00.880
I hear you were worried about me.

42:03.705 --> 42:04.720
'Scuse me ?

42:04.777 --> 42:06.963
The bomb at the garage
under the car ?

42:08.686 --> 42:10.910
A young man that I greatly admire
and respect

42:10.927 --> 42:12.573
is putting his life on the line.

42:15.788 --> 42:16.661
What ?

42:18.797 --> 42:20.040
I do something ?

42:20.358 --> 42:22.331
What you did with the bomb
was stupid.

42:27.648 --> 42:31.101
Gideon, I couldn't leave that lady
out there by herself like that.

42:32.935 --> 42:34.620
I didn't say you were wrong.

42:38.367 --> 42:40.443
And what he said I said.

42:42.175 --> 42:43.863
I said.

42:49.348 --> 42:50.583
I knew that.
