WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.343
Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.359 --> 00:03.035
I didn't ask for you to do
anything nice for me, Toby.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.236
And I thought that you
were leaving. What happened?

00:05.237 --> 00:06.530
Would you ever think
that maybe I needed you

00:06.329 --> 00:07.699
to do something nice for me?

00:07.723 --> 00:10.248
And also I ran into your friend
Duke, who's a real dick,

00:10.273 --> 00:12.077
- by the way.
- He's not my friend.

00:12.102 --> 00:13.702
And my offer still stands.

00:14.142 --> 00:15.409
I'm in cabin 13.

00:16.577 --> 00:18.169
I'm not cut
out for theater.

00:18.194 --> 00:20.613
You do that a lot. Doubt yourself.

00:20.967 --> 00:23.030
The band booked a five-state tour.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.171
And I think I want to go.

00:26.624 --> 00:29.052
The oncologist estimates he's
only got a few more months.

00:29.077 --> 00:30.454
Should we start
digging his grave now

00:30.478 --> 00:32.311
or should we wait until
there's an actual body?

00:32.336 --> 00:35.030
Eight years ago, I was
pregnant for the first time,

00:35.055 --> 00:37.884
and Randall was vying
for partner at his firm

00:37.919 --> 00:39.694
and he made sure I didn't lift a finger.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.314
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

00:41.715 --> 00:43.257
Then one morning, I was in the bathroom,

00:44.188 --> 00:45.905
and he called out to me.

00:46.015 --> 00:48.416
He was confused because
he couldn't see anything.

00:49.764 --> 00:52.353
He had worked himself into
a nervous breakdown.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.106
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:58.131 --> 01:00.094
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:00.129 --> 01:02.630
Is that my Valentine's Day card?

01:02.665 --> 01:05.066
If it is, I-I'm gonna need
to make yours a lot longer.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.935
No, this is, uh, this is a list

01:06.969 --> 01:10.905
of everything that I need you to
do when I go on tour next week.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.057
Ah. So, this is Kevin and
Randall's football schedule.

01:13.081 --> 01:13.696
Mm-hmm.

01:13.721 --> 01:16.197
This is the night that
Randall has debate team.

01:16.222 --> 01:19.157
This is, uh, a check for
Kate's music lessons...

01:19.191 --> 01:21.125
Babe. Baby, baby.
Contrary to popular belief,

01:21.160 --> 01:23.665
I've actually, I've
met our children before.

01:23.899 --> 01:26.297
Look, for the next month,
I'm just, I'm gonna ply them

01:26.332 --> 01:28.900
with... with greasy Chinese
and when the boys start to stink

01:28.934 --> 01:30.814
I'm gonna take them out
back and hose them down.

01:31.071 --> 01:34.134
Stop. I already feel guilty
about leaving them, and you.

01:34.707 --> 01:35.924
Yeah, well, we're gonna be fine.

01:35.948 --> 01:38.349
Now give your husband a kiss
because it's Valentine's Day.

01:39.477 --> 01:40.563
- Fine.
- Yeah.

01:40.588 --> 01:42.274
But only 'cause it's Valentine's Day.

01:42.781 --> 01:43.915
- Yeah.
- Mwah.

01:44.087 --> 01:46.651
Hey, you know what? I'm
really, really excited

01:46.692 --> 01:47.673
about your show tonight.

01:47.698 --> 01:48.493
You are?

01:48.526 --> 01:49.993
- Yeah. Really excited.
- Hmm.

01:50.173 --> 01:52.790
But don't get too tired
from all the singing, okay?

01:52.825 --> 01:54.994
'Cause I still want to take you
out to O'Shannon's for dinner.

01:55.018 --> 01:57.243
- Unless you want to shake things up... 
- No, no.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.740
Only O'Shannon's on Valentine's Day.

01:59.765 --> 02:01.099
That's our tradition.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.752
Best bacon cheeseburgers
in all of Pittsburgh.

02:02.776 --> 02:04.040
You getting the onion rings?

02:04.065 --> 02:05.727
Hell yes, we're doing onion rings.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.754
Cool wife.

02:08.494 --> 02:09.503
Hot hubby.

02:10.181 --> 02:11.434
Mm.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:32.169 --> 02:33.699
Well, that didn't take long.

02:34.176 --> 02:35.805
You know, uh, for a minute there,

02:35.839 --> 02:38.348
you actually convinced
me that I was like you.

02:38.609 --> 02:41.387
That deep down, I was
just damaged goods.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.813
And then I realized, that's ridiculous.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.918
Do I have issues? Yes.

02:46.283 --> 02:47.917
But deep down, I'm awesome.

02:47.951 --> 02:51.223
And until you can figure out
why you are such a jackass,

02:51.248 --> 02:53.375
you're gonna wander this camp miserable

02:53.400 --> 02:55.059
and alone till the day that you die.

02:55.707 --> 02:58.684
Probably saying something
snarky underneath your breath.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.020
To a horse.

03:01.707 --> 03:04.433
You ever wonder why I get away

03:04.468 --> 03:06.512
with saying whatever
the hell I want all day?

03:07.598 --> 03:08.864
It's 'cause my parents,

03:09.142 --> 03:11.192
they own this godforsaken place.

03:11.740 --> 03:12.740
Yeah.

03:13.143 --> 03:14.426
You're done here.

03:23.575 --> 03:26.159
So, Kevin Pearson, tell me
a little bit about yourself.

03:26.184 --> 03:28.026
How did you get started
in this business?

03:28.051 --> 03:29.847
Uh, well. Modeling, actually.

03:29.881 --> 03:31.346
You know, um...

03:31.371 --> 03:32.860
Catalogue stuff, mostly.
For my first gig,

03:32.884 --> 03:35.223
I was actually "Guy in toe socks."

03:35.567 --> 03:36.878
Let's talk about The Manny.

03:36.903 --> 03:38.324
Uh-huh. Yeah, no. The Manny was a...

03:38.348 --> 03:40.268
was a really great
learning experience for me.

03:40.293 --> 03:41.158
But, uh...

03:41.192 --> 03:42.726
You know, after a while, I just...

03:42.761 --> 03:45.167
felt like it was time to
broaden my horizons, if you will.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.415
You wanted to be taken seriously.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.133
Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.534
You wanted to be in a play.

03:50.568 --> 03:51.698
Yeah. That's right.

03:51.948 --> 03:54.526
So you decided you would sleep

03:54.565 --> 03:56.885
with the lead actress in that play.

04:00.315 --> 04:01.596
So. I... well...

04:01.621 --> 04:03.674
And then you slept with the playwright.

04:05.752 --> 04:07.418
I mean, I didn't... It was a diff... 
Um...

04:07.452 --> 04:09.602
And then when they
wanted to close the play,

04:09.627 --> 04:12.284
you decided to "self produce"?

04:13.198 --> 04:14.767
Yeah. That's right.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.060
What? Let me get this straight.

04:16.094 --> 04:17.394
You, Kevin Pearson,

04:17.428 --> 04:20.634
a vapid pretty boy who made his mark

04:20.659 --> 04:24.168
pretending to breastfeed
an infant from his pectoral

04:24.534 --> 04:25.936
thought he could actually

04:25.970 --> 04:29.135
be taken seriously as a stage actor.

04:31.963 --> 04:32.868
I know.

04:32.893 --> 04:35.389
- I know it. Uh, but I, you know... 
- Seriously. Who is this guy?

04:35.413 --> 04:36.424
- Well, uh... 
- Let's get out of here.

04:36.448 --> 04:37.614
- Katie.
- Honestly.

04:37.649 --> 04:39.450
I got to play tennis
with Salman Rushdie.

04:39.772 --> 04:40.608
Jesus.

04:47.468 --> 04:48.319
Hello?

04:48.343 --> 04:49.343
Did I wake you up?

04:49.377 --> 04:50.374
No. No, I've been awake.

04:50.399 --> 04:51.399
I'm awake.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.092
Did you have that Katie
Couric nightmare again?

04:54.117 --> 04:56.171
What? No. Of course not.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.288
What are you talking about?

04:57.587 --> 04:59.530
Who'd she leave to play tennis with?

05:00.428 --> 05:01.538
Salman Rushdie.

05:01.563 --> 05:02.866
- Huh.
- Yeah, it's...

05:03.921 --> 05:05.625
Well, I just, um,

05:05.866 --> 05:07.805
I-I just wanted to say that
I really wish I could be

05:07.829 --> 05:09.716
at your opening tonight,
but no one would cover

05:09.741 --> 05:10.890
- my double shift, so... 
- It's okay. You know,

05:10.914 --> 05:12.466
it's probably for the best;

05:12.500 --> 05:13.874
my whole family will be there.

05:13.899 --> 05:17.147
And I'm not sure... opening
night is, uh, you know,

05:17.172 --> 05:18.649
the right venue to reveal to everyone

05:18.673 --> 05:19.967
that my ex-wife and I are...

05:21.632 --> 05:23.116
What are we doing, by the way?

05:23.514 --> 05:25.264
Well, I'd say we're...

05:26.901 --> 05:28.858
cautiously dating?

05:29.811 --> 05:31.905
Cautiously... I'll take that.
I like that.

05:33.147 --> 05:35.092
Um, well, break a leg tonight.

05:36.311 --> 05:37.311
Yeah.

05:37.397 --> 05:38.960
Yeah, call Kate. She's really good

05:38.985 --> 05:40.288
with you when you're nervous.

05:40.313 --> 05:41.578
Sophie, I'm not nerv... 
Why would I be nervous?

05:41.602 --> 05:42.733
I know all my lines.

05:42.758 --> 05:43.803
Okay.

05:44.296 --> 05:45.296
Bye.

06:01.530 --> 06:03.155
I want to...

06:03.180 --> 06:05.366
... split your accounts
between you and Sanjay.

06:07.063 --> 06:09.303
The medication isn't working anymore.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.069
I don't want to do this to you.

06:11.094 --> 06:12.094
I can take it.

06:12.983 --> 06:14.842
Do you want to stop
the chemo, William?

06:15.562 --> 06:18.819
Why is there a photo of me and a
letter that you sent to William...

06:18.954 --> 06:20.796
Randall,
you have to understand...

06:20.821 --> 06:23.397
Understand what?
That you knew my father?

06:23.399 --> 06:26.101
You kept him from me my entire life?

06:26.126 --> 06:27.749
- Everything that I... 
- Just stop!

06:35.692 --> 06:36.738
Hey!

06:37.409 --> 06:38.360
Hey.

06:38.385 --> 06:39.952
What are you doing? You all right?

06:40.441 --> 06:43.636
Yeah. Just... pushed it...

06:44.089 --> 06:45.058
a little too hard.

06:45.098 --> 06:47.510
All right. You make this
run every day, Randall.

06:47.535 --> 06:48.910
You getting soft on me, huh?

06:48.935 --> 06:51.542
Old man? You getting soft on me?

06:51.567 --> 06:52.644
Yeah, right.

06:53.117 --> 06:54.972
Last one home makes the protein shakes.

06:57.435 --> 06:58.464
Yeah, all right.

07:12.745 --> 07:15.348
But we anticipate, over
the next six months,

07:15.376 --> 07:18.292
returns on your investment
north of 17%...

07:18.894 --> 07:19.956
- Baby?
- Yeah.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.191
You missed a button.

07:21.229 --> 07:22.542
Oh. Oops.

07:23.441 --> 07:26.105
We got these video calls with
30 of our top clients tomorrow

07:26.130 --> 07:27.667
to go over quarterly earnings.

07:27.692 --> 07:29.626
And I was up late with
William last night,

07:29.651 --> 07:31.434
so I haven't had a chance
to go over the numbers.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.442
I told you Jessie offered to
cancel his trip to Chicago.

07:33.466 --> 07:35.667
And I already told you that
you're not staying with Jessie.

07:35.691 --> 07:37.736
- It's fine. I was happy to do it.
- It's my sweater,

07:37.760 --> 07:39.528
- and I want to wear it!
- But you promised I could!

07:39.552 --> 07:42.722
Girls, please. Would you give
your sister back her dividends?

07:42.891 --> 07:43.803
- Huh?
- Hey.

07:43.828 --> 07:45.868
Sit down and eat your breakfast.

07:46.342 --> 07:47.674
Hey, Lisa. What's up?

07:47.708 --> 07:48.752
Give it to me. It's mine.

07:48.776 --> 07:50.143
I didn't say you could have it!

07:50.177 --> 07:51.162
- What?
- Yes, you did.

07:51.187 --> 07:52.671
- And mom said you have to share!
- Hey, girls. Please!

07:52.695 --> 07:54.351
- Shh. I can't hear your Aunt Lisa.
- Hey. I got you.

07:54.375 --> 07:55.889
Randall, I can wash one dish.

07:55.914 --> 07:57.523
Yeah, but they said she's
gonna be all right, right?

07:57.547 --> 07:59.623
- Said who's gonna be all right?
- You'll spill something on it!

07:59.647 --> 08:00.809
Will not! Will not!

08:00.834 --> 08:03.506
Girls, hey! Please, your
mother's on the phone.

08:04.931 --> 08:05.732
William?

08:05.859 --> 08:07.252
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

08:07.277 --> 08:08.428
Hey, come here.

08:08.453 --> 08:10.979
- I'm all right, I'm holding my breath.
- All right, all right, all right.

08:11.003 --> 08:12.637
My mother slipped and fell on her way

08:12.662 --> 08:13.718
to the bathroom last night.

08:13.742 --> 08:15.334
- What? Is she okay?
- Oh...

08:15.359 --> 08:17.881
They think she'll be
okay. She broke her hip.

08:18.377 --> 08:20.311
- I have to go down to D.C.
- Of course.

08:20.561 --> 08:22.092
Oh, it's the worst timing.

08:22.117 --> 08:23.694
Hey, don't you worry about me.

08:23.719 --> 08:25.631
- And Kevin's play is tonight.
- It's fine.

08:25.656 --> 08:26.967
Hey, we'll figure it out.

08:27.459 --> 08:29.155
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.389
Okay. I'm gonna go pack a bag.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.419
Okay.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.480
Uh...

08:36.592 --> 08:38.701
I'm gonna call the service to
send over a nurse for the day.

08:38.725 --> 08:40.365
- I don't need a nurse!
- Yes, you do!

08:40.390 --> 08:41.457
End of discussion.

08:41.904 --> 08:43.184
Tess, go get dressed.

08:43.210 --> 08:45.740
- But Ann... 
- Also end of discussion.

08:49.422 --> 08:51.060
Will Grandma be okay?

08:54.269 --> 08:55.365
Of course, baby.

08:56.279 --> 08:57.997
Everything's gonna be just fine.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.230
Yeah, yeah... this is Jack Pearson.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.986
I was hoping to reserve the booth
under the photo of Muhammad Ali.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.972
That's... that's my
wife's favorite booth.

09:17.011 --> 09:20.386
Okay. Great. Thanks for your
help. We'll see you then. Okay.

09:21.746 --> 09:24.136
O'Shannon's. Valentine's Day dinner.

09:24.465 --> 09:25.621
- Ah.
- Yeah.

09:25.646 --> 09:27.347
Bec's going on tour next week, so...

09:27.735 --> 09:29.745
Spending time together
while we still can, you know?

09:29.769 --> 09:32.332
You're handling this whole
tour thing great, by the way.

09:32.357 --> 09:34.074
Yeah? I am?

09:36.058 --> 09:37.090
Are you?

09:38.168 --> 09:39.387
- Jack.
- Mm.

09:39.754 --> 09:41.504
- Yeah.
- It's me.

09:47.371 --> 09:48.996
Why the hell is she going on tour?

09:49.390 --> 09:51.858
I mean, I could deal with a piano bar,

09:51.892 --> 09:53.393
a couple nights a week, but a tour?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.658
I mean, who does she think she is?
Janis freaking Joplin?

09:56.371 --> 09:59.066
We've got three kids.

09:59.091 --> 10:00.340
Three teenagers at home.

10:00.365 --> 10:03.004
But I can't tell her that I think
it's crazy, because then...

10:03.354 --> 10:05.324
she's just, she's
gonna resent me forever.

10:05.511 --> 10:06.761
That's true.

10:06.948 --> 10:09.666
Yeah. And then this
guy Ben, in her band.

10:09.691 --> 10:11.168
I've met him a couple of times.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.972
He has a thing for her. H-He, oh,

10:12.997 --> 10:14.777
he clearly has a thing for her...

10:14.840 --> 10:17.160
Jack. It's Rebecca.

10:17.971 --> 10:20.207
Wouldn't matter if this
guy was Jeff Goldblum.

10:20.232 --> 10:21.636
She only has eyes for you.

10:21.661 --> 10:23.004
Jeff Goldblum. Really?

10:23.347 --> 10:24.855
Have you seen Jurassic Park?

10:24.880 --> 10:25.855
Yeah.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.972
This guy's got something.

10:29.263 --> 10:30.433
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:32.457 --> 10:36.136
Hey, um, since Rebecca's
gonna be gone next weekend,

10:36.161 --> 10:38.223
maybe you and I could check
out that new place on Lincoln.

10:38.247 --> 10:40.222
I mean, y-you don't have
to drink or anything,

10:40.247 --> 10:42.386
but, uh, even though Shelly and I...

10:43.060 --> 10:45.027
you know, haven't been split that long,

10:45.871 --> 10:47.871
our marriage has been dead a long time.

10:47.896 --> 10:50.447
And I, and I think I'm
ready to get back out there.

10:50.472 --> 10:51.480
And I need my wing man.

10:51.505 --> 10:53.305
Hey, how 'bout you come
to Bec's show tonight?

10:54.074 --> 10:56.990
I'm sure there's gonna be a
bunch of lonely hearts there,

10:57.024 --> 10:58.411
you could buy them a
Valentine's Day drink.

10:58.435 --> 10:59.836
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:59.861 --> 11:01.777
- Yeah, o-okay
- Yeah.

11:02.230 --> 11:03.252
Yeah.

11:03.551 --> 11:06.119
You know what I'll do? I'll
wear that new fedora I got.

11:06.387 --> 11:07.941
- Don't do that.
- I'm going to.

11:08.113 --> 11:09.613
Embarrass yourself, and me!

11:09.638 --> 11:10.879
I look great in that hat.

11:15.551 --> 11:16.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:19.329 --> 11:20.488
Ta-da.

11:20.879 --> 11:22.324
You're not the only one who can, uh,

11:22.349 --> 11:23.894
plan an awkward surprise visit.

11:27.972 --> 11:29.605
- Not funny?
- Uh-uh.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.023
Look, I was a jerk yesterday.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.347
Yeah, you kind of were.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.175
W-well, I'm sorry.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.730
I am.

11:37.794 --> 11:38.996
It's just that, you know,

11:39.021 --> 11:40.972
between the classes and the therapy,

11:40.997 --> 11:42.347
I've been in this bubble,

11:42.372 --> 11:44.254
and you when you showed
up it just threw me.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.399
And I'm not making an excuse,
it's just what happened.

11:46.775 --> 11:48.342
Oh, I was kicked out.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.840
- Of the camp?
- Yeah.

11:49.865 --> 11:50.754
Why?

11:50.779 --> 11:52.558
I told that jerk Duke off.

11:53.425 --> 11:56.816
It turns out that his family
actually owned the place, so...

11:57.503 --> 11:58.847
Well, that's a relief.

11:59.404 --> 12:02.050
Not the getting kicked out part,

12:02.075 --> 12:03.897
the, uh, part about Duke.

12:03.922 --> 12:05.050
Why a relief?

12:05.075 --> 12:06.121
Um...

12:06.229 --> 12:09.691
I guess I was afraid that
you might fall for him.

12:11.381 --> 12:12.441
What?

12:12.754 --> 12:14.996
- Why?
- Because I was jealous.

12:15.146 --> 12:16.636
And I was worried.

12:17.643 --> 12:19.019
And then I started thinking,

12:19.044 --> 12:20.996
"Why are you jealous and worried, Toby?

12:21.021 --> 12:23.808
You're usually so confident
and carefree and well-hung."

12:24.207 --> 12:26.425
But then I realized, I don't even know

12:26.450 --> 12:28.629
what type of guys you
liked before you met me.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.113
I-I...

12:30.785 --> 12:33.186
Between all of the breaking up
and the getting back together,

12:33.220 --> 12:34.521
and the having a heart attack

12:34.555 --> 12:36.519
two minutes after
getting back together...

12:36.544 --> 12:39.058
which was terrible timing
on my part, I must admit...

12:39.083 --> 12:42.480
our relationship has
been a bit of a wild ride.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.441
Yeah, I mean, it has...

12:47.312 --> 12:49.574
kind of been a roller coaster.

12:49.599 --> 12:51.160
Oh. Kind of?

12:51.691 --> 12:54.107
We're, we're talking
about getting married

12:54.141 --> 12:55.425
this summer

12:55.735 --> 12:58.971
and there's still so much that
we don't know about each other.

12:59.427 --> 13:00.761
Well, all right, well...

13:01.613 --> 13:03.738
if you want know anything, just ask me.

13:05.362 --> 13:06.308
Really?

13:06.333 --> 13:08.246
Yeah. Let's just, like...

13:08.726 --> 13:10.058
you know, dig deep.

13:10.503 --> 13:12.904
Toby and Kate, the deep dive.

13:13.414 --> 13:14.581
Okay.

13:14.606 --> 13:15.715
The deep dive.

13:15.740 --> 13:18.342
All right, I'd like that. Um...

13:18.577 --> 13:21.312
But can we do this deep dive
at, like, a men's clothing store?

13:21.337 --> 13:23.016
Because now that I know
you're not gonna leave me

13:23.040 --> 13:24.740
for the Jared Leto of fat camp,

13:24.765 --> 13:27.322
I need to get some clothes for
your brother's opening tonight.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.277
- Jared Leto?
- Yeah.

13:29.302 --> 13:30.469
I don't... no.

13:30.494 --> 13:31.761
He's like a bad boy.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.443
Really? Jared Leto?

13:33.468 --> 13:35.683
- He's kind of Jared Leto-ish.
- I don't know.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.605
Hey, Kate, it's me again.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.408
I'm freaking out over
here, I need you to tell me

13:40.432 --> 13:41.856
that I'm not gonna bomb
my opening night and become

13:41.880 --> 13:43.363
the laughingstock of New York City.

13:43.388 --> 13:45.363
- Anyway, listen, call me.
- Kevin?

13:45.688 --> 13:47.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.763
Uh, I know things have
been weird between us,

13:50.788 --> 13:52.996
but I just wanted to say break a leg.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.842
Thank you, thank you. You too.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.090
And congratulations, I
mean, it's a beautiful play.

13:58.115 --> 13:59.082
You know, people are gonna love it.

13:59.107 --> 14:00.933
- Yeah? You think so?
- Yeah. Yes.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.660
Yes, I definitely think
so, unless... I suck.

14:03.685 --> 14:05.966
'Cause Ron said that The New
York Times is coming tonight.

14:06.097 --> 14:08.129
Which is crazy, I mean, The
New York freaking Times

14:08.154 --> 14:09.574
is gonna review our play.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.160
Ah!

14:12.185 --> 14:13.185
Ah...

14:13.436 --> 14:14.803
Yeah.

14:16.941 --> 14:19.488
So right now Travis Bauman
and I are neck and neck

14:19.513 --> 14:20.933
to finish first place in our class.

14:20.958 --> 14:22.824
But if I don't get an A on
my Hamlet essay...

14:22.849 --> 14:24.597
Hey, I will write that
Hamlet essay for you

14:24.622 --> 14:26.175
if you stop telling me this story.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.004
Come on, man, it's Valentine's Day.

14:29.029 --> 14:30.144
Go on a date.

14:30.316 --> 14:33.121
Kate, do we know someone desperate
enough to go on a date with Randall?

14:33.152 --> 14:34.371
Randall, ignore him.

14:34.396 --> 14:35.965
He thinks he walks on water now

14:35.990 --> 14:37.715
because he's having sex with Sophie.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.808
What?!

14:38.941 --> 14:40.918
You're having sex?

14:43.754 --> 14:45.719
I disown you. You are de-twinned.

14:45.744 --> 14:47.043
- Kevin... 
- Hold on.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.355
- No, no, we should have a... 
- We are not talking about this!

14:50.660 --> 14:52.480
Guys, did you know about this?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.972
Honestly, I just assumed.

14:55.582 --> 14:57.082
I got to work on my paper.

14:58.226 --> 14:59.246
Bye.

15:00.605 --> 15:04.207
Okay, okay, so who was
your first celebrity crush?

15:04.497 --> 15:05.527
Aladdin.

15:05.855 --> 15:07.494
- Did you say Aladdin?
- I did.

15:07.519 --> 15:08.933
- The cartoon?
- Yeah.

15:08.968 --> 15:11.035
- Did you see his abs?
- Fair play.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.715
Did you have a pet when you were a kid?

15:12.740 --> 15:15.441
I did. I had a pet turtle named Shirley.

15:15.741 --> 15:16.902
As in Laverne and...

15:16.927 --> 15:17.933
Of course.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.019
- Were you, uh, popular in high school?
- Uh, no.

15:21.044 --> 15:22.824
Did you just hear the
name of my pet turtle?

15:22.849 --> 15:23.699
- I did.
- Huh?

15:23.724 --> 15:25.449
How about... how about you?

15:25.584 --> 15:27.566
Oh, definitely not.

15:27.591 --> 15:28.621
I think I found it.

15:28.646 --> 15:29.761
My colors.

15:30.058 --> 15:32.144
- And it's on sale.
- Ooh.

15:32.175 --> 15:34.144
Uh, excuse me. My good man,

15:34.169 --> 15:36.461
do you have this dazzler in a 56 long?

15:37.730 --> 15:38.793
All right.

15:38.910 --> 15:40.769
I love that you love flashy clothes.

15:40.794 --> 15:41.793
Thank you.

15:41.818 --> 15:43.418
So, like, when did that start?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.912
I don't know, I've always
just had a thing for fashion.

15:45.937 --> 15:48.606
You know, sixth grade,
a well-fitting pair

15:48.641 --> 15:50.918
of Z. Cavaricci jeans
and I was done for.

15:50.943 --> 15:52.363
I love learning that about you.

15:52.388 --> 15:53.957
I love telling you that about me.

15:53.982 --> 15:56.472
- Ooh, cats or dogs?
- Uh, dogs.

15:56.754 --> 15:58.129
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

15:58.154 --> 16:01.004
- And what about kids?
- Fo' sho.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.588
Come on. Keep 'em coming, let's go deep.

16:04.316 --> 16:05.769
- Okay.
- Yeah, come on.

16:05.794 --> 16:07.090
Um, so...

16:07.332 --> 16:11.269
you said that after the divorce,
you considered killing yourself.

16:11.294 --> 16:13.043
Was that like, a one-time thing,

16:13.068 --> 16:14.747
or was that something
that you've thought about

16:14.771 --> 16:16.438
other times too?

16:19.041 --> 16:21.241
Yeah, I know, I've been
sitting on that one for a while.

16:22.129 --> 16:23.816
Yeah... Good news, big guy.

16:23.841 --> 16:25.175
Got it in a tall.

16:26.972 --> 16:28.249
He's got it in a tall.

16:32.277 --> 16:33.355
Randall.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.340
- Hey.
- It's 11:30.

16:34.365 --> 16:37.300
I'm sorry, sorry.
I... my father's nurse,

16:37.325 --> 16:38.925
I had to wait for her to show up,

16:38.950 --> 16:40.722
and then drop my girls off at school.

16:40.747 --> 16:42.308
Uh, Beth's mom broke her hip.

16:42.463 --> 16:43.535
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.981
Sorry to hear that. Hate to do this,

16:45.005 --> 16:46.590
but had to move tomorrow's quarterly

16:46.615 --> 16:48.129
with Buchanan up to this afternoon.

16:48.154 --> 16:49.255
What?

16:49.510 --> 16:51.113
Uh, why?

16:51.262 --> 16:53.808
Because Buchanan asked us
to move it to this afternoon.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.691
If that's a problem, I can
have Sanjay on the call...

16:55.715 --> 16:57.000
No, no, no, I...

16:57.418 --> 16:59.699
- Buchanan's my guy, I can handle it.
- Great.

17:00.905 --> 17:02.205
Hello.

17:02.293 --> 17:03.721
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

17:03.746 --> 17:05.575
- Yeah, you know... 
- What are you doing here?

17:05.877 --> 17:07.407
Uh, well, I'm, uh...

17:07.433 --> 17:08.915
I'm your 11:45, Randall.

17:08.941 --> 17:09.799
Really?

17:09.824 --> 17:11.167
Not on my calendar. Hey, Kelsey?

17:11.193 --> 17:12.894
Yo, hey, whoa, that was a joke, man.

17:12.950 --> 17:16.019
I... look, I don't even understand
what the hell you do here. What...

17:16.053 --> 17:18.026
- ... why would I make an appointment?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

17:18.050 --> 17:20.490
- What's up?
- Uh, nothing.

17:20.523 --> 17:23.105
You know, I just, you know, got
a couple hours before I either...

17:23.277 --> 17:26.195
remake myself as a
serious actor, you know,

17:26.230 --> 17:27.675
or destroy what's left of my career.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.420
Your father's nurse is on the phone.

17:29.832 --> 17:31.004
Okay, put her through.

17:35.191 --> 17:36.691
Where the hell is my headset?

17:37.496 --> 17:39.063
- Randall? Buddy?
- What?

17:39.097 --> 17:40.264
Your... it's, you know...

17:40.298 --> 17:41.488
Oh, right.

17:41.972 --> 17:43.371
This is Randall.

17:43.969 --> 17:46.254
No, no, Jenna, you're
his nurse, he can't...

17:46.584 --> 17:48.465
Will you put him on the phone, please?

17:49.467 --> 17:50.621
He did...

17:50.774 --> 17:52.355
Seriously?

17:53.651 --> 17:55.840
All right, just don't go anywhere.

17:57.688 --> 17:58.918
I'm, I'm coming.

18:00.261 --> 18:02.066
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:04.519 --> 18:06.152
William just fired his hospice nurse

18:06.177 --> 18:07.582
and locked her out of the house.

18:07.607 --> 18:08.832
- Randall.
- Yeah?

18:09.217 --> 18:10.350
Headset.

18:11.014 --> 18:12.214
Oh, Jesus.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.675
- Thanks. I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

18:14.707 --> 18:15.855
All right... excuse me.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.207
Jack?

18:33.030 --> 18:35.871
- Condoms.
- I know, I'm not stupid.

18:37.675 --> 18:38.761
Respect.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.639
Always respect.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.216
- It's not good enough.
- What?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.558
What's not good enough?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.850
My paper.

18:46.713 --> 18:48.113
What else can I say about Hamlet

18:48.138 --> 18:49.262
that hasn't already been said?

18:49.286 --> 18:50.470
Okay, okay.

18:50.495 --> 18:52.418
- Travis Bauman... 
- Shh, shh, shh.

18:52.829 --> 18:54.731
Trav... Travis Bauman,
he's really good at English.

18:54.755 --> 18:56.648
- And he's gonna do better than me.
- Breathe.

18:56.673 --> 18:57.728
Yeah, breathe.

18:57.753 --> 18:59.332
You're putting too much
pressure on yourself, son.

18:59.356 --> 19:00.885
Everything's gonna
be fine, just breathe.

19:00.909 --> 19:02.009
Okay, come on.

19:02.439 --> 19:05.782
Refresh my memory about,
uh, about Hamlet.

19:07.040 --> 19:07.970
Okay.

19:07.995 --> 19:09.775
- He was a prince, and... 
- Mm-hmm.

19:10.771 --> 19:13.431
He was a prince.
Did he have a mom or a dad?

19:16.943 --> 19:18.811
So I calmed him down.
I mean, that kid...

19:18.845 --> 19:20.111
How can I leave them, Jack?

19:20.136 --> 19:21.714
Kevin's having sex,

19:21.748 --> 19:23.783
Randall's giving himself stress ulcers,

19:23.817 --> 19:25.785
Kate is... I don't even
know what Kate's doing,

19:25.819 --> 19:28.243
but she's wearing a ton of
eyeliner, so that can't be good.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.268
I can't...

19:29.657 --> 19:31.532
Ugh, I can't, I can't go.

19:31.557 --> 19:35.059
I got to call the band, and
tell them I'm not, I'm not going.

19:38.048 --> 19:39.790
No, no.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.703
- You're going.
- Really?

19:42.407 --> 19:45.103
You sure that now is not
the worst possible time

19:45.128 --> 19:46.876
- for me to go?
- No, look, I got it.

19:46.901 --> 19:47.931
Okay?

19:48.742 --> 19:49.942
I got it.

19:57.101 --> 19:59.517
Yeah, I have...

20:00.721 --> 20:03.390
struggled with depression
ever since I was a teenager.

20:03.861 --> 20:06.134
Starting about when my
parents got divorced.

20:06.237 --> 20:08.861
But then, when Josie and I split up,

20:08.886 --> 20:11.118
that was, like, rock bottom.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.071
You know, because I had spent
ten years convincing myself

20:15.096 --> 20:17.064
that I wouldn't end up like my parents.

20:17.455 --> 20:19.151
You know, that my marriage
was gonna be different.

20:19.175 --> 20:20.681
And then, all of a sudden...

20:21.446 --> 20:22.861
it, uh, wasn't.

20:23.810 --> 20:24.845
Um...

20:24.870 --> 20:28.751
And that is probably the closest
I came to considering suicide.

20:30.087 --> 20:32.056
And it's not... I didn't... 
it's not like I...

20:32.081 --> 20:33.501
I didn't go out and buy a gun.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.173
But I did, uh, sit around,

20:37.450 --> 20:39.017
and get really drunk,

20:39.042 --> 20:42.017
and count up all of
the extra painkillers

20:42.042 --> 20:44.595
that I had leftover from
my wisdom tooth surgery.

20:44.780 --> 20:48.095
And wonder if that was
enough to get the job done.

20:50.892 --> 20:52.384
I hate that.

20:52.828 --> 20:54.579
Yeah, me too.

20:54.604 --> 20:59.111
Um... but I have done a lot
of work on myself since then.

20:59.868 --> 21:03.236
You know, I have
single-handedly financed

21:03.261 --> 21:04.579
my therapist's new Tesla.

21:05.134 --> 21:07.345
And now...

21:08.579 --> 21:10.392
he has a new car

21:10.680 --> 21:13.214
and I am in the best
place I've ever been.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.689
So, any of that scare you?

21:18.510 --> 21:19.743
No... hmm

21:19.768 --> 21:22.170
Okay. Can I ask you a big one now?

21:22.993 --> 21:24.914
This is what we're
doing. We're going deep.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.501
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

21:26.526 --> 21:30.759
Um... you know, you never really talk

21:30.784 --> 21:32.368
about your dad's death.

21:34.587 --> 21:36.549
- That's not true.
- No, I...

21:36.583 --> 21:38.060
- When we met... 
- No. I know, I know that

21:38.084 --> 21:39.510
you've told me the basics
of how your dad died,

21:39.534 --> 21:41.244
but, uh, the-the couple
times that I've brought it up

21:41.268 --> 21:42.321
you kind of shut me down,

21:42.346 --> 21:44.696
so I was wondering if you
could tell me what happened.

21:46.002 --> 21:47.134
You know, exactly.

21:48.372 --> 21:49.372

take care of you, William.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.646
All right? I got to
get back to the office.

23:48.670 --> 23:50.801
I got a big, important phone
call that I cannot miss.

23:51.134 --> 23:52.701
So, please...

23:53.253 --> 23:55.341
William, will you let the
nurse take care of you?

23:58.149 --> 24:01.099

Yeah, you know, I'm excited.

27:30.136 --> 27:32.524
I-I also got a little case
of the preshow jitters.

27:32.549 --> 27:34.469
I was sort of hoping to
talk to my mom, you know?

27:34.502 --> 27:35.580
She can calm me down.

27:35.605 --> 27:39.502
Talk to somebody artist to
artist about the, uh... jitters.

27:40.064 --> 27:41.572
- Well... 
- I'm gonna suck.

27:41.689 --> 27:44.431
Okay? I'm gonna s... I'm
gonna absolutely suck, okay?

27:44.456 --> 27:46.591
And, uh, the critics
are gonna crucify me.

27:46.616 --> 27:48.595
And I should just... I
should just get in my car,

27:48.620 --> 27:50.128
I should go back to The
Manny, you know?

27:50.152 --> 27:51.830
I should go back to The
Manny, ask for my job back.

27:51.854 --> 27:53.501
I mean, I know they already
have Morris Chestnut,

27:53.525 --> 27:55.383
but, uh, they could
have two Mannies. Right?

27:55.408 --> 27:56.690
I thought about that
on the way over here.

27:56.714 --> 27:57.326
Kevin.

27:57.351 --> 27:58.510
If I present it to them in
the right way, then I...

27:58.534 --> 28:00.572
Kevin, calm down. Okay?

28:03.236 --> 28:06.103
I was a project manager for 30 years.

28:06.128 --> 28:07.970
I don't have a creative bone in my body,

28:07.995 --> 28:10.340
and I can't talk to
you artist to artist.

28:10.365 --> 28:13.371
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
I... I know that, Miguel.

28:13.396 --> 28:16.450
But I do know what I used
to do when I was nervous...

28:16.942 --> 28:20.575
about a big work presentation
or about anything.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.004
I'd talk to your dad.

28:24.067 --> 28:25.895
He was... he was my person.

28:25.925 --> 28:28.262
He was the one that could steady you...

28:29.061 --> 28:31.004
when the world felt
like it was spinning.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.536
Yeah, that was my dad. That's very true.

28:35.561 --> 28:37.606
Yeah, and you remind me
of him, you know that?

28:39.106 --> 28:42.028
The way that you move
your hands when you talk.

28:42.684 --> 28:44.637
The way you walk across a room.

28:45.481 --> 28:47.482
Sometimes you remind me of him

28:47.664 --> 28:50.004
so much that the hair
on my arm stands up.

28:52.450 --> 28:55.004
It's why it breaks my heart
that you don't like me, Kevin.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.902
Because when I'm around you,

28:57.927 --> 29:00.504
I feel like I get a little
piece of my best friend back.

29:01.629 --> 29:03.434
- Miguel, uh... 
- Now, you...

29:04.171 --> 29:06.028
are Jack Pearson's son.

29:07.207 --> 29:08.809
You have him inside of you.

29:10.192 --> 29:11.590
And when you're nervous

29:11.615 --> 29:13.809
or you're at your most
nerve-racking moment,

29:13.834 --> 29:15.426
the curtain's about to go up...

29:16.059 --> 29:18.942
all you have to do is
remind yourself of that.

29:20.433 --> 29:23.496
Think about what he'd
do... and you'll be fine.

29:27.584 --> 29:30.012
I know. Thank you.

29:32.053 --> 29:33.442
Um...

29:34.684 --> 29:35.833
I should get back to the theater.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.225
Well, you sure... you
sure you don't want to wait

29:38.250 --> 29:39.723
for your mother to get back?

29:39.748 --> 29:44.286
Uh... no, I'm-I'm-I'm okay.

29:46.012 --> 29:47.301
I'm all right.

29:50.337 --> 29:51.934
Miguel, uh...

29:54.557 --> 29:56.098
I don't not like you.

29:56.944 --> 29:58.153
So...

29:59.239 --> 30:02.708
Well... it's a start then.

30:02.733 --> 30:03.864
Isn't it?

30:08.060 --> 30:09.200
Yup.

30:17.184 --> 30:19.052
So, I just want to say again that, uh,

30:19.086 --> 30:22.122
all of your earnings reports
will be sent out as PDFs,

30:22.156 --> 30:23.600
unless you explicitly
request that they are sent

30:23.624 --> 30:25.235
- as hard copies, which... 
- Young lady.

30:25.259 --> 30:26.886
Uh, you've told me that three times.

30:26.911 --> 30:28.090
Can we get to the numbers already?

30:28.114 --> 30:29.387
Yes, yes, we can.

30:29.412 --> 30:30.559
Thank you.

30:30.584 --> 30:31.829
- Randall.
- Yeah?

30:32.403 --> 30:33.403
Take it away.

30:34.598 --> 30:37.106
Right. Um... numbers.

30:38.903 --> 30:40.325
Let's talk numbers.

30:45.926 --> 30:48.051
It's been a, uh, strong quarter...

30:48.426 --> 30:52.404
for us. Uh... and for you, Mr. Buchanan.

30:52.598 --> 30:54.848
Uh, lots of, uh...

30:57.877 --> 30:59.129
... increases.

31:00.098 --> 31:02.489
Sorry. If you look...

31:07.653 --> 31:09.192
You know, if you're looking...

31:10.301 --> 31:12.262
at the growth of, um...

31:15.895 --> 31:21.893
Uh... through our position in... 
Dry Season and Wind Contracts,

31:21.918 --> 31:24.369
we've seen continued growth

31:25.067 --> 31:26.839
beyond all projections this quarter.

31:29.903 --> 31:31.443
Um...

31:31.478 --> 31:32.778
as, um...

31:34.129 --> 31:37.121
the precipitation levels were below,

31:37.146 --> 31:39.051
even the lowest estimates, uh,

31:39.085 --> 31:42.855
we plan to see profits rise
as we maintain those contracts

31:42.889 --> 31:44.590
over the next few months...

31:46.512 --> 31:47.536
Jack?

31:48.461 --> 31:50.172
- Hey.
- Good to see you made it out to a show.

31:50.196 --> 31:52.286
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I haven't seen you in a while.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.476
Yeah, been working a lot of late nights.

31:54.559 --> 31:56.702
Totally, totally. How about Rebecca?

31:56.895 --> 31:59.176
- Isn't she great out there?
- Yes, she is.

31:59.201 --> 32:00.307
I mean, me and the guys,

32:00.332 --> 32:01.535
we've have been playing
together for years.

32:01.559 --> 32:03.786
She joins the band,
boom, we book this tour.

32:03.811 --> 32:06.082
She's... she's really something special.

32:06.645 --> 32:07.879
Yep, I know.

32:08.167 --> 32:09.668
- Yeah.
- That's why I married her.

32:10.036 --> 32:11.246
Yeah, well, lucky man.

32:11.283 --> 32:13.168
I remember when we
were together, she said

32:13.193 --> 32:14.473
she never wanted to get married.

32:14.498 --> 32:16.386
- See you at Juliet's.
- What do you mean, together?

32:16.410 --> 32:18.043
- Huh?
- You just said together.

32:18.068 --> 32:19.708
What do you... what
do you mean, together?

32:20.856 --> 32:22.200
Oh, crap. I thought...

32:22.225 --> 32:23.496
I thought you knew.

32:23.621 --> 32:25.918
It was very brief. It was another life

32:25.943 --> 32:28.739
and, you know, we were... we were kids.

32:29.246 --> 32:30.879
That's probably why she didn't tell you.

32:30.904 --> 32:32.387
I didn't say she didn't tell me.

32:32.554 --> 32:34.422
Oh, so, what are you...

32:34.447 --> 32:35.715
It doesn't concern you

32:35.740 --> 32:37.293
what I know or what I don't know.

32:37.318 --> 32:39.246
That is between me and my wife.

32:39.271 --> 32:41.293
Of course. Sorry I said anything.

32:41.318 --> 32:42.684
Have a good night, man.

32:45.473 --> 32:46.506
Okay...

32:46.531 --> 32:48.028
you ready for some food?

32:49.411 --> 32:50.661
You know what, uh...

32:50.686 --> 32:51.957
actually, I'm not very hungry.

32:51.982 --> 32:53.716
How about we just call it?

32:54.059 --> 32:56.028
What happened to bacon cheeseburgers?

32:56.196 --> 32:57.262
Yeah...

32:58.934 --> 32:59.934
Okay.

33:00.304 --> 33:02.871
Yeah, let's go home.

33:03.433 --> 33:04.433
Okay.

33:07.545 --> 33:09.046
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:12.067 --> 33:13.223
There he is.

33:13.989 --> 33:16.028
- Hey. Hey.
- All right.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.817
- Talk about a turnout.
- Right?

33:19.224 --> 33:20.268
Toby...

33:20.292 --> 33:22.200
- Oh, you look great.
- Thank you so much.

33:22.225 --> 33:23.805
- Good to see you.
- Great, looking good.

33:23.829 --> 33:25.378
- Shall we go in?
- Yeah, let's go.

33:25.403 --> 33:26.975
Actually, uh, can you
just give us a minute?

33:26.999 --> 33:28.051
We'll meet you inside.

33:28.076 --> 33:29.115
- Yeah, of course.
- Sure, here.

33:29.139 --> 33:30.793
- Thanks so much.
- We'll see you in there.

33:30.817 --> 33:33.700
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine. I just, uh...

33:34.873 --> 33:37.036
I've felt a little
weird ever since, um...

33:39.246 --> 33:41.496
- Ever since things got weird?
- Yeah.

33:41.582 --> 33:42.762
Um, I think that

33:43.005 --> 33:45.778
we might have just rushed
into this a little bit.

33:48.005 --> 33:50.246
Wait, does that mean that
you don't want to get married?

33:50.271 --> 33:51.521
Get married? No, no, no, of course,

33:51.545 --> 33:53.115
of course, of course I
still want to get married.

33:53.139 --> 33:55.707
Okay, good. 'Cause, me, too.

33:55.732 --> 33:58.161
I just think we should
do it when we're ready.

34:00.602 --> 34:02.403
You know, I think the woman that I marry

34:02.786 --> 34:04.676
should be able to talk to me about...

34:05.092 --> 34:06.359
everything.

34:08.308 --> 34:09.559
Agreed.

34:10.947 --> 34:12.442
So if it's okay with you,

34:12.467 --> 34:15.101
I think we should just
take our time being engaged.

34:15.456 --> 34:16.926
And then, when we're ready,

34:16.951 --> 34:18.918
we plan the wedding of the century.

34:18.975 --> 34:20.856
Maybe at a water park, huh?

34:20.880 --> 34:22.321
'Cause that's kind of been my dream.

34:23.036 --> 34:25.356
- We won't even worry about that yet.
- Come on,

34:25.380 --> 34:27.215
we can have the reception
in the Lazy River.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.224
- What?
- People floating around with drinks.

34:29.248 --> 34:30.293
- Toby.
- Huh?

34:30.318 --> 34:31.442
I don't know.

34:36.848 --> 34:40.723
Hey, you've said three whole
words since we left the show.

34:41.442 --> 34:43.286
Are you gonna tell me
what the problem is?

34:43.311 --> 34:45.739
- I don't have a problem, Rebecca.
- Yes, you do, Jack.

34:45.764 --> 34:46.943
I don't know what you
and Ben talked about,

34:46.967 --> 34:48.976
but something happened
while I was changing.

34:49.002 --> 34:50.293
Listen, I-I... I'm telling... I'm
telling you, just leave it.

34:50.318 --> 34:51.473
I'm not leaving it, Jack.

34:51.498 --> 34:53.120
You're acting like a crazy person.

34:53.145 --> 34:54.956
- What's going on?
- Okay, I found out.

34:54.982 --> 34:56.629
I found out that you
were gonna go on tour

34:56.654 --> 34:57.809
with your ex-boyfriend.

35:01.145 --> 35:03.114
My ex-boyfriend? I don't...

35:03.139 --> 35:06.317
I don't know what Ben told you,
but he's not my ex-boyfriend.

35:06.342 --> 35:08.442
We dated for two months... two months

35:08.467 --> 35:10.279
- when I was 19 years old.
- You've been spending

35:10.303 --> 35:12.940
three nights a week at
rehearsal till 11:00

35:12.965 --> 35:14.086
- at night with this guy... 
- Shh.

35:14.110 --> 35:16.090
and you think that I
didn't deserve to know that

35:16.115 --> 35:17.098
you had history with him?

35:17.123 --> 35:18.731
That's exactly why I didn't tell you.

35:18.756 --> 35:20.090
Because it was nothing

35:20.115 --> 35:22.029
and I knew that you would
get like this about it.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.921
Like... how? Like this?

35:23.946 --> 35:25.180
How-how do I get?

35:25.205 --> 35:27.273
You get crazy and jealous.

35:27.298 --> 35:29.076
And I didn't want you sitting at home,

35:29.100 --> 35:31.535
spinning out about something
that didn't even mean anything.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.728
You know what? I don't
want you going on tour.

35:34.309 --> 35:35.364
- What?
- No.

35:35.389 --> 35:37.028
The kids, they need you right now.

35:37.053 --> 35:39.895
You just told me this afternoon
the kids didn't need me.

35:39.911 --> 35:41.779
That you would have
everything taken care of,

35:41.813 --> 35:44.183
before you knew that I used to date Ben.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.693
You know what? I didn't
want you going on tour

35:45.717 --> 35:46.871
then, either. But I...

35:46.896 --> 35:48.310
I was trying to be supportive,

35:48.335 --> 35:49.769
I was trying to be a good guy.

35:49.794 --> 35:51.224
- You were trying to be a good guy?
- Yeah.

35:51.248 --> 35:54.057
Wow, I didn't know you had to try
so hard to be a good guy, Jack.

35:54.082 --> 35:55.093
- That's news to me.
- You know what?

35:55.117 --> 35:56.833
I thought... I thought that
you deserved something

35:56.857 --> 35:58.098
for yourself.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.247
- And now I don't.
- No.

35:59.272 --> 36:01.021
- Now I don't deserve that?
- No, no, that's...

36:01.045 --> 36:02.757
- That's what you said.
- Don't confuse my words.

36:02.781 --> 36:03.832
That's not what I meant!

36:03.857 --> 36:05.981
- It's what you just said, Jack.
- You know what?

36:06.231 --> 36:07.575
You shouldn't have lied to me.

36:08.645 --> 36:11.309
- I never lied to you.
- No, you lied to me!

36:13.317 --> 36:14.721
For the past 16 years,

36:14.746 --> 36:18.481
I have put everything and
everyone ahead of myself,

36:18.506 --> 36:19.715
you and the kids!

36:19.740 --> 36:21.408
And I just knew that if I were ever

36:21.433 --> 36:23.137
to tell you about this whole Ben thing,

36:23.162 --> 36:24.692
you would spin out about it

36:24.717 --> 36:27.270
and I needed to have
something for myself

36:27.295 --> 36:28.981
without you getting in the way.

36:36.325 --> 36:38.973
I never thought of myself
as being in your way, Bec.

36:46.442 --> 36:47.723
I need some air.

37:11.442 --> 37:12.809
Ah, damn it.

37:22.253 --> 37:24.590
I-O-U-A-E-I-O-U-A-E-I-O.

37:24.615 --> 37:27.083
You're gonna bomb it, dude.
You're gonna bomb it, it's fine.

37:29.694 --> 37:31.293
Kevin?

37:31.318 --> 37:33.004
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

37:33.723 --> 37:35.051
Thank you.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.137
Randall, hey.

37:44.645 --> 37:45.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:46.322 --> 37:47.942
Uh, what can I do for you?

37:48.733 --> 37:51.364
Uh, you called me. Right?

37:52.801 --> 37:54.051
Right, of course.

37:54.575 --> 37:55.637
I'm sorry.

37:55.786 --> 37:57.019
I, uh...

37:58.058 --> 37:59.858
I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight, man.

38:00.158 --> 38:01.668
I got caught up at the office.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.286
Come on, are you serious?

38:06.254 --> 38:08.098
I really wish I could be there.

38:08.132 --> 38:09.934
It's just one of those things, you know?

38:12.145 --> 38:13.203
Yeah,

38:13.237 --> 38:16.129
you sort of known about this
for a long time, though. This...

38:16.676 --> 38:17.684
That's right.

38:19.270 --> 38:20.153
Okay.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.403
Um...

38:23.106 --> 38:24.614
all right, well, whatever.

38:24.639 --> 38:26.543
Well, you'll see it eventually, right?

38:29.434 --> 38:30.543
Right?

38:30.668 --> 38:31.832
Okay, then.

38:39.114 --> 38:42.991
Okay, everyone, places for
act one. Have a great show.

38:46.536 --> 38:47.771
We miss anything?

38:47.805 --> 38:48.972
No, no, welcome.

38:49.005 --> 38:50.984
- Hey.
- It's just about to start.

38:51.008 --> 38:52.075
You guys made it in time.

38:52.109 --> 38:53.982
Your brother, is he coming?

38:54.007 --> 38:55.141
I don't know.

39:05.223 --> 39:06.823
I can't believe we'll be out there

39:06.857 --> 39:08.858
in front of all those
people in, like, 30 seconds.

39:10.037 --> 39:12.631
I'm imagining all of
them in their underwear.

39:13.188 --> 39:15.014
What about you? What
are you thinking about?

39:17.735 --> 39:19.560
I'm thinking about what my dad would do.

39:21.075 --> 39:22.443
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:22.476 --> 39:25.320
please silence your cell phones
and we hope you enjoy the show.

39:26.711 --> 39:28.451
Okay, let's do this.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.889
David, you know, I had
that dream again...

40:37.835 --> 40:39.236
Randall...

41:12.308 --> 41:13.651
Here it is.

41:13.676 --> 41:15.284
Bacon cheeseburger, side of onion rings.

41:15.309 --> 41:16.309
Thanks.

41:20.444 --> 41:21.620
Maker's rocks.
