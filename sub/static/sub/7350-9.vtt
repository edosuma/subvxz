WEBVTT

01:19.347 --> 01:20.548
Stop! Police!

01:22.283 --> 01:24.318
*

01:31.359 --> 01:32.426
Ah!

01:37.498 --> 01:38.366
Don't move!

01:38.399 --> 01:39.867
Hey! Sir, do not move!

01:39.900 --> 01:41.469
Come off the ladder.
Freeze.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.404
NOPD!
Come towards me!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.572
Okay, okay, I...

02:04.592 --> 02:06.660
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:06.694 --> 02:09.297
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:09.330 --> 02:11.632
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:11.665 --> 02:12.866
* How, how, how, how

02:12.900 --> 02:15.436
* Hey, hey

02:21.275 --> 02:22.676
* You gotta come on.

02:27.748 --> 02:28.849
So, you heading up north

02:28.882 --> 02:30.351
to spend Thanksgiving
with your folks?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.752
Ah, I think I'm opting out

02:31.785 --> 02:33.721
of the Stepford family dinner
this year.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.723
Parental gin and tonics
at 11:00,

02:35.756 --> 02:39.327
followed by ritualistic
screaming and yelling at 11:30,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.662
and tearful apologies
by halftime.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
I think I'm just gonna stay put

02:43.697 --> 02:46.434
and whip up a batch of my chards
for the potluck.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.869
Chards

02:48.902 --> 02:50.371
Yeah.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.639
Brody clan serves them
as an appetizer.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.541
Well, down here they're part
of the main course.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.675
Thank you.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
And I'm the greens guy.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.212
You sound intimidated.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.580
Worried about
a little competition?

02:59.613 --> 03:01.815
King,

03:01.849 --> 03:03.617
tell her about my collards.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.786
Talk of the town.
Well, if they're
so special,

03:05.819 --> 03:08.456
why don't you put
a little green on your greens?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.890
Oh, like a greens
Mm-hmm.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.226
Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.895
So what's the number
for dinner this year, six?

03:14.928 --> 03:16.230
No, seven.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.731
Laurel called.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.401
She's bringing home some boy
named Orion.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.802
Orion like the constellation?

03:21.835 --> 03:24.004
Or Metallica song?
Poor Laurel. Hope to God

03:24.037 --> 03:25.973
she doesn't really like
this one.

03:26.006 --> 03:26.974
Work.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.442
Fill them in on our burglar.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.777
We have multiple injuries

03:29.810 --> 03:31.512
due to the height
of the fall,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.747
but the cause of death
is likely cervical fractures.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.684
Got two dislocations
at C1 and C2.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.487
NOPD tried to pull him over
on a random traffic stop.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.021
He led them on
a wild-goose chase,

03:41.054 --> 03:42.856
hoping to get away
with that stolen loot.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.295
Why you looking at us like that?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
Waiting for the first question.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.433
Navy or Marines?
Neither.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.668
He murk some seaman
when he robbed him?

03:54.702 --> 03:57.705
Nope, no direct military
connection to our dead man.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.407
Then why are we here?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.042
That stolen gun

04:02.075 --> 04:03.944
is Navy-issued.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.583
So we find the owner
and return it.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.018
NOPD is cross-checking

04:11.051 --> 04:12.420
robbery calls
with the stolen loot

04:12.453 --> 04:13.621
to lock down a location.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.757
Filed off the serial number.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.526
We'll have to get it
to Sebastian,

04:18.559 --> 04:20.027
see what he can give us.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.462
I'm thinking
about shaking things up

04:21.495 --> 04:22.896
this year at the potluck,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.865
maybe move away
from my marshmallow Jell-O mold

04:24.898 --> 04:26.033
and papaya-cantaloupe fruitcake.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.768
So long as you approve,
of course.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.370
I was gonna suggest it

04:29.403 --> 04:32.072
if you didn't make
the change voluntarily.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.607
Really?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.075
I knew there were
a lot of leftovers.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.378
I just thought it was
sort of a gluten, caloric,

04:37.411 --> 04:38.646
too-much-of-a-good-thing
kind of thing.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.448
More of a...

04:40.481 --> 04:42.583
papaya-cantaloupe fruitcake
sort of thing.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.753
So there are several techniques
that can be used

04:45.786 --> 04:48.055
to re-sequence
obliterated serial numbers.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.957
There's chemical etching,
which is the most common,

04:49.990 --> 04:51.759
going back to
metallurgical examinations

04:51.792 --> 04:52.960
in which etching solutions

04:52.993 --> 04:55.429
were applied to
cross sections of metal.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.398
Then there's heating,
which creates

04:57.431 --> 04:58.966
a visible difference
between the damaged

04:58.999 --> 05:01.569
and undamaged regions
of the substrate...
Sebastian.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.870
Today?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.004
Sebastian,
here's the powder

05:04.037 --> 05:05.639
I pulled
from the burglar's pants.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.508
I was wondering
if you could do an analysis.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.377
Sure. Now, I, on
the other hand,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.745
decided to magnetize
the gun and bombard it

05:11.779 --> 05:13.046
with fine magnetized
particles.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.982
The particles fill in
the gaps that are left

05:15.015 --> 05:17.117
from indentations when
someone files them off.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.052
Which allowed me to recover
the serial number,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.888
run it through
the Navy's database,

05:20.921 --> 05:22.055
and bing-bang-boom,

05:22.089 --> 05:23.924
your stolen Smith & Wesson

05:23.957 --> 05:26.059
belongs to Chief Petty Officer
Jacob Tarlow.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.060
PRIDE:
Can you get me

05:27.094 --> 05:28.862
an address?
Yeah.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.064
Uh...

05:31.098 --> 05:32.700
that's gonna be hard,

05:32.733 --> 05:36.036
since Jacob was murdered
40 years ago.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.407
This case...

05:39.440 --> 05:41.409
was similar to the one
that inspired

05:41.442 --> 05:43.343
the movie Mississippi Burning.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.113
Jacob Tarlow,

05:46.146 --> 05:47.515
Jewish naval officer

05:47.548 --> 05:50.117
who enlisted black recruits.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.586
They lynched him for it.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
Wait. Is this one of your...

05:54.021 --> 05:57.525
Yes, my bedside file stack.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.026
This is the original.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.093
I-I'm sorry.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.095
There's a

06:02.129 --> 06:03.697
The Wade Files.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.132
You haven't told him?
No, I didn't want

06:05.165 --> 06:06.600
to burden young Sebastian

06:06.634 --> 06:08.101
with that particular obsession,

06:08.135 --> 06:10.971
but I have a stack of files,

06:11.004 --> 06:12.873
unsolved cases,

06:12.906 --> 06:15.676
that are my reading material
on the nights I can't sleep.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.545
The many nights she can't sleep.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.813
This case, Jacob Tarlow,

06:19.847 --> 06:21.181
was the first of those files.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.650
I was a powerless

06:22.683 --> 06:25.152
college intern
in the coroner's office.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.120
The coroner
didn't even bother

06:27.154 --> 06:27.821
to look at Jacob's body.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.558
He ruled his death a suicide.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.959
NOPD closed the case.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.627
But wait, if he was hung,

06:33.661 --> 06:35.095
how does a gun figure
into the murder?

06:35.128 --> 06:38.065
WADE: He had it on him
before he was executed.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.000
And it's always been speculated

06:40.033 --> 06:41.502
that whoever murdered him...

06:41.535 --> 06:44.171
Stole his gun.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.172
The gun was never recovered.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.874
Case went cold.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.877
Now that it's resurfaced...

06:52.245 --> 06:55.449
...maybe we could finally solve
a 40-year-old murder.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.530
Looking good.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.064
You're a horrible liar.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.867
Liver cancer.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.769
If life's a marathon,

07:15.803 --> 07:17.805
I'm basically
at the finish line.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.540
Still,

07:19.573 --> 07:21.475
it's been a good run.

07:21.509 --> 07:24.778
Hannah and I met at the time
of Jacob's death.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.047
And Miriam was
about a month old.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.782
Mm-hmm. I had two mothers

07:28.816 --> 07:30.718
before it was, uh, all the rage.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.122
Liked this one the moment
I saw her face.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.990
Even with the sadness

07:37.024 --> 07:38.492
of becoming a widow at 19,

07:38.526 --> 07:39.827
I knew Loretta Wade

07:39.860 --> 07:40.994
was a keeper.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.800
Oh, Agent Pride,
this is, uh,

07:46.834 --> 07:50.270
Jacob's brother Esau
and Paul Hare,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.240
close friend of Jacob's
and mine for...

07:53.273 --> 07:55.275
Close to forever.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.077
Here's the medication.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.680
I'll get you some water.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.818
HANNAH:
So,

08:04.852 --> 08:07.254
you, um,

08:07.287 --> 08:08.889
you found Jacob's gun.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.291
Recovered as part
of a likely robbery.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.095
You said in the past
that Jacob had his gun

08:15.128 --> 08:16.263
the night he was murdered?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.198
I saw it with him
when he left the house.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.601
He was pretty sure he'd meet up
with resistance.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.202
And he had it with him
at the recruitment site?

08:22.235 --> 08:23.804
We weren't there long

08:23.837 --> 08:25.305
before the Confederate Brigade
jumped us.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.674
It was chaos.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.308
Jacob and I were
fighting off four,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.544
five of those guys each.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.912
Cops did show up,
but they weren't much help.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.682
Somehow, Jacob and
I got separated.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.917
I managed to make it
back to my car.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.285
I just rushed right over here

08:38.318 --> 08:40.320
to make sure
that he got back safely.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.255
But Jacob never made it home.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.559
Later that night, uh,
we got a call from the police,

08:45.593 --> 08:48.829
informing us that Jacob
was dead.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.864
When we went to claim
Jacob's body,

08:50.898 --> 08:53.801
this gun, his gun, was missing

08:53.834 --> 08:56.203
from the holster.

08:57.304 --> 08:59.039
We'd like to
reopen the case.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.910
We would need to reexamine

09:02.943 --> 09:04.845
all of the evidence.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.780
WADE:
Including...

09:06.814 --> 09:09.282
Jacob's body.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.020
With the advancements
in DNA technology,

09:13.053 --> 09:14.888
we could find evidence

09:14.922 --> 09:16.624
that helps solve the case.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.595
Here, I'll help you.

09:24.297 --> 09:28.101
You find who killed my husband.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.306
Jacob Tarlow's gun.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.076
We know where the burglar
stole it from?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.911
Nope.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.780
We tracked the stolen items
back to the Bywater.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.348
So Brody and I went
knocking on doors.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.383
People laid claim
to most of the stolen loot,

09:43.416 --> 09:44.952
but no takers on Jacob's gun.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.219
You really going with "loot"?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.621
Well, what do you prefer?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.089
Booty

09:49.122 --> 09:50.357
Perp prop?

09:50.390 --> 09:53.293
What about Jacob Tarlow's
NOPD case file.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.328
Destroyed in Katrina.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.364
But they did still have this.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.271
That the rope
Jacob was hung with?

10:04.304 --> 10:05.939
Yeah.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.340
We're gonna send it
to Sebastian,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.176
see if he can pull DNA.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.078
All right,

10:11.111 --> 10:12.813
prime suspects,
what do we know about them?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.682
Confederate Brigade

10:14.715 --> 10:17.751
was a bastard offshoot
of the KKK.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.987
Black church
and synagogue bombings,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.321
race riots, you name it.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.923
BRODY:
Loretta sent over
Jacob's Navy journal.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.158
It looks like the Brigade
attacked him several times

10:25.192 --> 10:27.327
prior to his death.
We need to put faces

10:27.360 --> 10:28.428
with this group.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.763
BRODY: I'll run
the Confederate Brigade

10:29.797 --> 10:31.264
with the FBI database.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.300
See if we can get a pop
on its members.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.968
Lasalle here.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.806
Speak.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.342
1972 seems...

10:42.375 --> 10:44.111
late for a lynching.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.312
"Lynching."

10:45.345 --> 10:47.314
"Hate crime."

10:47.347 --> 10:49.316
Different names, same sentiment.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.152
Discrimination didn't end
with the Civil Rights Act.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.121
Even when I became an agent,

10:54.154 --> 10:56.423
opened up shop in the '80s,

10:56.456 --> 10:58.959
some of my partners
on the force

10:58.992 --> 11:01.795
still held
old-school beliefs.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.797
Sebastian has some info
on the powder

11:03.831 --> 11:05.365
that he found
on the burglar's pants.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.234
Want us to head
over there?
Yeah.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.402
And I'll head over
to the cemetery with Loretta.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.039
LASALLE:
Hey, Laurel.
Hey.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.273
Hello, Laurel.
Hey, Daddy.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.042
Music major.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.477
With honors,
thank you very much.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.913
Where's Orion?
Oh, he's taking
the bus in tonight.

11:19.947 --> 11:23.150
I told him I would make sure
it was safe to talk turkey.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.985
Of course it's safe,
though I'm headed out.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.319
Oh, field trip.
I'll ride with.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.387
Persistent.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.389
Wonder where
I got that from.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.291
All right, you
stand back,

11:31.324 --> 11:32.359
be quiet.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.161
Oh...

11:34.194 --> 11:36.496
rules say I can't take you
in the official vehicle.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.098
So we take the family car?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.501
PRIDE:
Orion.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.436
That's quite a name.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.305
Yeah, his major is economics,

11:45.338 --> 11:47.507
but after he's done with school,
he's talking about

11:47.540 --> 11:51.378
getting his degree
in La Science de la Pâtisserie.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.780
Pastry chef?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.148
No. Stop right now.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.416
Before you even
get started.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.418
I am bringing him home
on one condition.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.053
What's that?

12:00.087 --> 12:03.290
You cannot befriend
my boyfriend.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.458
You brought Barry
to Jazz Fest,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.327
Andrew and Chris
still call you for advice,

12:07.360 --> 12:08.896
and from what I understand,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.431
you sent Kenneth a check
to cover his rent last month?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.266
Just till his scholarship
came through.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.536
Dad, we went on three dates
two years ago.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.238
He's a good guy.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.539
This can't happen.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.909
You meet them,
you're nice to them,

12:21.942 --> 12:23.811
they like you,
and then it gets all weird.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.146
Are they with me for me,
or are they with me

12:26.179 --> 12:28.248
because of super cool
Agent Dwayne Pride?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.483
Look, what do you
want me to do?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.319
Give them the
Clint Eastwood stare

12:32.352 --> 12:33.954
that your
grandfather gave me

12:33.987 --> 12:35.322
when I started
dating your mother?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.290
Just...

12:37.324 --> 12:40.260
be a dad, you know?

12:40.293 --> 12:43.163
A little aloof,
a little standoffish.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.331
And if you want
to pretend

12:44.364 --> 12:46.266
like you're being
overprotective,

12:46.299 --> 12:47.500
that's fine, too.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.170
Just...
no cooking together.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.439
And... and none
of that bromance stuff.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.509
No bromance.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.279
Thank you.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.289
WADE:
This case is the reason

13:09.322 --> 13:12.125
I moved back
to New Orleans permanently.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.427
I was thinking
about heading out West

13:14.461 --> 13:16.296
after leaving Harvard,

13:16.329 --> 13:19.432
but I couldn't shake the memory
of being called

13:19.466 --> 13:22.535
to cut Jacob down
from the noose.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.438
Coroner threw
his body in a box,

13:25.472 --> 13:28.408
brushed it off
as a suicide.

13:28.441 --> 13:32.045
Barely bothered
to examine him.

13:32.079 --> 13:35.382
"Southern trees
bear a strange fruit."

13:35.415 --> 13:38.118
"Blood on the leaves
and blood at the root."

13:38.151 --> 13:40.988
I said, "Loretta,

13:41.021 --> 13:46.059
"you will never let
another woman's man

13:46.093 --> 13:49.196
just get thrown in a box."

13:50.931 --> 13:52.933
Agent Pride.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.870
Officer Sullos.
Nice to see you.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.039
Not sure you're going to
feel that way in a second.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.474
You're gonna have to stop
what you're doing here.
Why is that?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.376
Court order--
to stop the exhumation

14:03.410 --> 14:04.978
of Jacob Tarlow's body.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.546
Who did this?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.982
Name is sealed with
the injunction.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.284
Sorry, Pride.
I'm just the messenger.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.260
Wow. What smells so good?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.162
Oh, my Italian kale.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.897
Wait.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.398
More greens?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.000
Yeah. Loretta told me
about the greens-off.

14:27.034 --> 14:27.935
Since I recently
discovered

14:27.968 --> 14:28.768
that my fruitcake
was not well received,

14:28.801 --> 14:30.637
I thought I'd get in
on the action.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.039
Since she's the judge,

14:32.072 --> 14:33.106
I decided to make
an algorithm

14:33.140 --> 14:34.507
based on all of her
favorite spices.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.178
Oh, man. This is
totally out of hand.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.680
Is that for your kale, too?
No, that's, uh...

14:40.713 --> 14:42.315
that's for the
case, actually.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.650
It's extract from the silt

14:43.683 --> 14:44.918
found on the
burglar's pant cuff.

14:44.952 --> 14:45.919
It's lead.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.654
Purest form of lead.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.423
Only found in industrial plants
and toxic waste dumps.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.992
That's not
your logical place

14:52.025 --> 14:54.361
for stolen watches,
jewelry and guns.
Uh-uh.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.163
You mind?
No, go ahead.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.430
BRODY:
If that purity of lead

14:57.464 --> 14:58.966
were at a residence,
there'd have to be

14:58.999 --> 15:00.968
some kind of permit or...
There you have it.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.703
Citation belonging to
New Orleans native Brick Myers.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.705
Fined a few
weeks ago.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.175
FBI database
says Brick Myers

15:08.208 --> 15:10.377
was a founding member of
the Confederate Brigade.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.045
Criminal record
as long as a bedsheet.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.080
I'll get an address.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.381
I'm calling Pride.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.729
Brick Myers, NCIS.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.164
Open up.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.383
Looks like this is where
Sticky Fingers made his entrance

15:50.417 --> 15:53.053
to steal Jacob's gun.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.199
MAN: Got a lot of buyers
willing to pay top dollar...

16:06.233 --> 16:09.002
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

16:09.036 --> 16:11.104
What you got?
Well, these

16:11.138 --> 16:13.406
are custom loads,
extra hot...

16:13.440 --> 16:16.009
NCIS! Freeze!

16:24.784 --> 16:26.586
Go!

16:42.402 --> 16:44.003
Get off me, bitch!

16:57.684 --> 16:59.152
Stop resisting.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.321
Stop... resisting.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.158
This has been...

17:05.192 --> 17:08.661
a long time coming.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.440
Gunrunning
across state lines.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.375
Manufacturing
bootleg ammunition.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.244
You're looking
at 20 years minimum.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.413
My people run Angola.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.281
Going back will be a homecoming.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.518
Chief Petty Officer
Jacob Tarlow.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.553
Some of your handiwork.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.255
BRODY:
Eyewitnesses said

17:35.288 --> 17:37.557
you beat him to a pulp
hours before his death.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.192
He started it.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.663
I went to talk to him at
the recruiting station.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.665
A friendly
"Hello. How are you?"

17:45.698 --> 17:47.567
He spit in my face.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.202
He called me names.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.837
I was defending myself.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.140
A few punches were thrown,
then we went our separate ways.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.474
If that's the case,

17:54.507 --> 17:57.444
then why was Jacob's gun,
taken off his dead body,

17:57.477 --> 17:59.379
stolen from your house
two days ago?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.348
Whoa, that was the Jew's gun?

18:01.381 --> 18:03.816
Yes.
Damn, small world.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.521
Look, if I would
have killed Tarlow,

18:08.555 --> 18:09.856
I'd have taken
full credit for it.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.225
The gun was simply

18:12.259 --> 18:14.494
a souvenir of the time.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.796
I bought it off some cop

18:16.829 --> 18:19.466
a couple months
after Tarlow's...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.334
suicide.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.671
And who would that cop be?

18:26.206 --> 18:29.542
The brothers in the Brigade
called him T-Bone.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.145
Man, you would be surprised

18:32.179 --> 18:33.780
some of the friends
we used to have

18:33.813 --> 18:35.682
in very high places.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.488
Brick is lying scum.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.689
Yes on the scum.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.624
Don't be so sure of the lying.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.693
Cozy relationships
between police and hate groups

18:46.726 --> 18:48.861
was not uncommon back then.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.531
If a police officer did
sell Jacob's gun to Brick,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.166
it might explain
why there wasn't

18:53.200 --> 18:54.634
an investigation
into his murder.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.336
Police cover-up suggested

18:56.369 --> 18:58.271
by a very unreliable source.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.572
Got to run
everything down.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.874
All right, Christopher...

19:01.908 --> 19:06.579
got the injunction hearing
switched over to Judge McCruter.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.580
Take Brody with you.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.782
Show her how you use your...

19:09.816 --> 19:12.519
'Bama charm
to sway the judicial process.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.453
Where you going, King?

19:13.486 --> 19:16.589
Apparently, I got
a hot date with a dummy.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.525
SEBASTIAN:
Unfortunately, deterioration
from environmental conditions

19:18.558 --> 19:21.561
prevented me from pulling
any kind of DNA, but...

19:21.594 --> 19:23.330
I matched the gauge
of the rope

19:23.363 --> 19:24.664
and the height
of the tree branch

19:24.697 --> 19:26.266
to reenact the murder

19:26.299 --> 19:28.635
using my trusty assistant
LASMAN here.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.769
First, the, uh, torque

19:29.802 --> 19:31.271
that caused
rope fraying on both

19:31.304 --> 19:32.972
the front and the back
of the tree branch

19:33.005 --> 19:36.643
indicates that Jacob's hangman
was hoisting him alone.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.645
You add to that
the height

19:38.678 --> 19:39.912
at which the rope was tied off,

19:39.946 --> 19:41.548
which I deduced
from the photograph here,

19:41.581 --> 19:42.949
and I was able to calculate

19:42.982 --> 19:45.485
the size of Jacob's killer,
given the average height

19:45.518 --> 19:47.687
and wingspan of adult males
living at the time.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.821
What do we got?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.523
Murderer stood between

19:50.557 --> 19:51.858
five-foot-six
and five-foot-eight in height.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.794
Brick's six-two at least.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.631
So it's not
Brick Myers.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.668
And we're back where
I've been for 40 years?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.404
Nowhere.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.810
Loretta...

20:10.843 --> 20:13.546
I need access to
Jacob Tarlow's body, Dwayne.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.248
We're trying to get
the injunction lifted.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.649
It takes time.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.418
Something Hannah
hasn't got much of.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.952
I spoke to
her family today.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.788
Hannah's taken
a turn for the worse.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.790
The stress of the case
taking its toll.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.626
I made her a promise, Dwayne.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.761
I've gone over this case...

20:28.795 --> 20:29.962
I know.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.664
Okay, I've read
Jacob's journals.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.700
I've searched my brain
to see if there's

20:33.733 --> 20:35.502
anything I could
have missed.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.404
I was 20.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.573
I wore skirts that scarcely
covered my thighs,

20:40.607 --> 20:43.743
and bikini tops-- if I
wore any tops at all.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.845
Jacob Tarlow's
blood sacrifice

20:45.878 --> 20:48.748
was during a time when
there were protests.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.817
Average citizens were being
monitored by the FBI.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.620
I bet there are photos.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.489
If there were,
I wouldn't show you any of them.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.291
Not photos of you.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
"Average citizens

20:59.559 --> 21:01.894
being monitored
by the FBI."

21:01.928 --> 21:04.297
COINTELPRO?

21:04.331 --> 21:05.898
FBI followed a lot of
different groups back then.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.767
Maybe even...

21:07.800 --> 21:09.669
The Confederate Brigade.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.672
You've pulled me out of the
abyss 1,000 times, Loretta.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.740
My turn now.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.708
YOUNG MAN:
Fennel seeds.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.477
I can't believe
you don't know

21:17.510 --> 21:19.679
anything about cooking.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.780
It's pretty
depressing.

21:20.813 --> 21:21.848
LAUREL:
I'm just... real bad.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.816
Daddy!

21:23.850 --> 21:25.318
Uh, this is Orion.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.953
Nice to meet you, Mr. Pride.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.821
Nice to meet
you as well.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.757
Uh, thanks for opening
your kitchen...

21:30.790 --> 21:32.692
letting me

21:32.725 --> 21:34.394
brine the turkey.
Yeah.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.828
Yeah, uh, whatever.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.567
Laurel tells me
you love to cook,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.803
so I knew you'd
appreciate these.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.972
Cumin, fennel seed

21:46.005 --> 21:47.874
and cinnamon.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.411
Why cinnamon?
Daddy...

21:51.444 --> 21:53.012
It's for the
fungiform papillae.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.015
The fungiform
papillae?
Mm-hmm.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.850
Taste buds at the
front of your tongue.
Uh-huh.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.719
You get the savory right away,

21:59.752 --> 22:01.788
as long as you
don't, uh...

22:01.821 --> 22:04.090
Don't dry it out.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.024
ORION:
Yeah. Of course not.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.393
The juices
stimulate

22:06.426 --> 22:07.960
the fungiform
papillae...
Mm-hmm.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.629
...which are then
awakened to the cinnamon,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.431
and you
get this...

22:11.464 --> 22:12.499
Sweet aftertaste.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.466
Exactly.
Yeah.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.767
Yeah.

22:14.801 --> 22:15.968
There's a whole science to it,

22:16.002 --> 22:18.505
but when I talk food shop
with Laurel,

22:18.538 --> 22:19.872
she just kind of stares at me.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.741
Like that?

22:24.544 --> 22:25.778
Exactly.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.980
Mmm.
BRODY: Pride?

22:28.014 --> 22:31.117
We got a hold of the classified
COINTELPRO files on the Brigade.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.685
We're set up in SCIF.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.687
PRIDE:
Guess I should, uh,

22:34.721 --> 22:36.122
go take a look.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.690
Why don't you do that?

22:44.931 --> 22:46.733
FBI's surveillance pictures
of the Confederate Brigade,

22:46.766 --> 22:50.136
collected from the
Counterintelligence Office.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.505
Three cheers
for domestic spying.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.741
They managed to capture
quite a few Hallmark moments

22:54.774 --> 22:56.175
outside their primary hangout.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.677
The Dixie Bootleg.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.412
Rural juke joint
I helped shut down

22:59.446 --> 23:01.448
for running moonshine
back in '81.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.882
We uploaded several photos
onto our system,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.184
and so far, this is what
we got from the analysis.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.921
I found three members
of law enforcement who hung out

23:08.955 --> 23:10.189
with the Brigade
on a regular basis.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.558
One of them could be T-Bone.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.692
Sebastian said

23:12.725 --> 23:13.926
that Jacob's killer

23:13.960 --> 23:14.927
was between five-six
and five-eight.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.633
LASALLE:
That rules out these two.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.770
Height analysis on this officer

23:23.803 --> 23:26.072
is five foot, seven inches.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.207
Sweet spot for Jacob's murderer.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.609
Run an age progression,
Christopher.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.880
LASALLE:
Age progression...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.047
coming up.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.919
40 years later.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.654
You recognize him?

23:43.155 --> 23:45.825
Why, yes, I do.

23:45.858 --> 23:50.463
Tom Hamilton,
Councilman Hamilton's father.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.865
And the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.479
MAN:
Dwayne Pride,

24:06.513 --> 24:07.947
as I live and breathe.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.849
Need to talk, Tom.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.655
Well, it's probably as good
a time as any, I suppose.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.956
Don't you think, Dougie?

24:16.989 --> 24:19.225
What, you-you here to
ruin my fishing trip?

24:19.258 --> 24:21.060
Huh?
I'm here...

24:21.093 --> 24:22.829
to speak to
your father

24:22.862 --> 24:24.497
about his involvement

24:24.531 --> 24:26.032
in the murder of Jacob Tarlow.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.834
:
I'll tell you...

24:27.867 --> 24:30.236
I mean, you... you're just
so desperate to get to me,

24:30.269 --> 24:32.939
that you'll make up
some cockamamie story

24:32.972 --> 24:35.107
about my father
and some old murder.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.580
PRIDE:
Name Brick Myers sound familiar?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.916
Can't say that it does.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.886
He I.D.'d you as selling him
a dead man's gun...

24:46.919 --> 24:48.187
T-Bone.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.223
T-Bone...

24:51.257 --> 24:54.026
No, no, isn't that
a

24:54.060 --> 24:56.228
It's also, apparently,
your father's nickname.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.930
All right, Daddy,
you do not

24:57.964 --> 24:59.899
have to answer to
this Keystone Cop.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.834
Stand down, Dougie.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.306
PRIDE:
Chief Petty Officer
Jacob Tarlow.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.608
Remember him?

25:08.641 --> 25:10.009
I tuned up

25:10.042 --> 25:11.711
a lot of criminals in my day.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.646
He wasn't a criminal.
He was a highly decorated

25:13.680 --> 25:14.847
Navy Chief Petty Officer

25:14.881 --> 25:16.983
that you took
an extra liking to.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.885
Eight unlawful arrests

25:18.918 --> 25:20.286
in six months.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.789
Establishing a pattern
of-of harassment is good,

25:22.822 --> 25:24.924
but what you need
is for me to admit

25:24.957 --> 25:27.627
that he got tired of
my harassing him
and he fought back.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.729
And I lost control,
and I strung him up.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.031
Sounds like a confession to me.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.166
Maybe a... tall tale

25:34.200 --> 25:36.836
from a feeble, senile old man.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.641
I gotta go to the restroom.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.109
Uh...

25:45.077 --> 25:46.746
Well, that was
a pathetic ploy,

25:46.779 --> 25:48.280
even for you, Dwayne.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.749
PRIDE:
What's pathetic

25:49.782 --> 25:51.250
is you filing for an injunction

25:51.283 --> 25:53.352
to stop the
exhumation

25:53.385 --> 25:55.755
of Jacob Tarlow
to protect your father.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.957
First:

25:57.990 --> 25:59.926
Keep coming
after my father,

25:59.959 --> 26:02.762
and I will make things
very uncomfortable

26:02.795 --> 26:04.964
for you in this city.
And second:

26:04.997 --> 26:06.799
You don't know that
that injunction is me.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.801
I don't have to know.
Judge will.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.269
And if your
name is on it,

26:10.302 --> 26:11.971
I will suggest
you be charged

26:12.004 --> 26:14.607
with accessory to
murder after the fact.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.147
Judge is expecting
your call.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.219
Checked with Tom
Hamilton's old precinct

26:27.253 --> 26:29.989
to see if he was on duty
the night of Jacob's murder.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.124
The logs were lost in a fire.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.093
So, how about this?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.662
Go to the family,

26:35.695 --> 26:38.631
see if anyone can put
Tom Hamilton at the fight

26:38.665 --> 26:41.333
on the night of
Jacob Tarlow's death.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.969
You got it, King.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.357
Now I can really get to work.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.700
WADE:
After all these years,

27:13.733 --> 27:16.368
I wasn't sure there'd
be something to go on.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.972
But when the dead
have something to say,

27:20.006 --> 27:21.741
not even time will shut them up.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.876
Normally,
in a hanging,

27:23.910 --> 27:26.045
one would expect
broken bones in the neck.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.080
It's due
to asphyxial resistance.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.249
You mean when someone struggles
as they're being choked?

27:30.282 --> 27:31.784
Exactly.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.086
Jacob lacked fractures
along the vertebrae,

27:34.120 --> 27:35.755
which means his
body was relaxed.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.124
It's like a-a drunk
driver avoids injury

27:38.157 --> 27:40.893
after passing out
at the wheel.
Jacob wasn't conscious?

27:40.927 --> 27:43.129
I believe he was dead
before he was hung,

27:43.162 --> 27:46.298
and my supposition
is reinforced by...

27:47.900 --> 27:50.036
...a depressed fracture,
like this one.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.204
Caused by an extreme blunt force

27:52.238 --> 27:54.173
at the point
of impact.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.909
And the tool of attack
often causes an indentation

27:56.943 --> 27:58.444
in the shape of the object used.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.446
I'll give you three guesses--

28:00.479 --> 28:01.881
first two don't count.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.049
His gun.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.185
Tom Hamilton
encounters Tarlow,

28:06.218 --> 28:07.854
there's some sort
of an incident,

28:07.887 --> 28:10.222
Hamilton gets a hold
of Tarlow's gun...

28:10.256 --> 28:13.092
And uses the blunt weapon
to kill Jacob.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.361
Hangs him to cover up
what he's done.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.364
And then, maybe as insurance,

28:18.397 --> 28:19.999
sells the gun to Brick,

28:20.032 --> 28:21.734
so that, should it
ever be found...

28:21.768 --> 28:25.504
All signs point towards
the Brigade and the lynching.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.374
Have I ever told you

28:28.407 --> 28:31.110
how high I get
from tracking down the truth?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.114
Thank you, Dwayne.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.986
Thank me when I tie
Tom Hamilton to the gun.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.255
SEBASTIAN:
Because of Loretta's discovery,

28:43.289 --> 28:44.991
I stopped looking at
the gun ballistically

28:45.024 --> 28:46.492
and examined
it materially,

28:46.525 --> 28:48.194
from a blunt-force
trauma perspective.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.162
So, to raise this
serological Titanic,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.198
I had to use a
technique I perfected,

28:52.231 --> 28:53.866
called the
"Jellyfish Effect."

28:53.900 --> 28:55.935
Some jellyfish are incandescent
under black lights,

28:55.968 --> 28:57.269
kind of like
nature's glow sticks.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.504
And this here...

28:58.537 --> 28:59.972
Spices for my
greens. No touchy.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.473
So I placed
Jacob's gun

29:01.507 --> 29:03.142
inside this sterile fish tank

29:03.175 --> 29:05.344
with a luminol vaporizer
attached to the side.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.985
PRIDE:
Is that blood,
glowing in the dark?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.186
It is.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.122
I cross-checked it
with Jacob's DNA.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.324
It's not a match, so most likely

29:18.357 --> 29:20.059
the killer cut himself
on the trigger

29:20.092 --> 29:21.360
when he hit Jacob over the head.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.361
Leaving blood spatter

29:22.394 --> 29:24.230
inside Jacob's gun.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.532
Tom Hamilton's DNA...

29:26.565 --> 29:28.434
Is not on file anywhere.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.469
I'll need a sample
to get a conclusive result.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.010
Coast Guard's
on standby.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.345
They'll confirm Tom
Hamilton's whereabouts

29:39.378 --> 29:41.013
as soon as he returns to port.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.381
I don't want to lose him.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.316
Make sure he's not fleeing.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.885
Hey.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.220
Where's Orion?
I sent him home.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.026
I told you I wasn't sure
how I felt about him

29:54.060 --> 29:56.062
and I didn't want this
to become a big deal.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.930
And all of a sudden,
it's "your dad" this

29:57.964 --> 29:59.165
and "your dad" that.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.833
What was I supposed to do?

30:00.867 --> 30:02.168
You were supposed to stay away.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.236
You invited him.
It's Thanksgiving.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.138
Well, clearly,
that was a mistake.

30:07.539 --> 30:08.941
Hey, King.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.977
We got a 20 on
Tom Hamilton.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.113
We'll talk later?

30:25.424 --> 30:27.059
Blood or urine?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.561
Just a simple swab
from your cheek,

30:29.595 --> 30:31.130
and I'm on my way.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.065
You don't have a warrant.
Innocent men

30:33.099 --> 30:34.867
don't need warrants
to clear their name.

30:34.901 --> 30:38.137
No one calls me "innocent,"
but I'm innocent of this.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.371
Then why fight it?

30:39.405 --> 30:40.940
'Cause that's what my family

30:40.973 --> 30:43.275
has always done when it concerns
you and your family.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.310
You should
respect that.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.978
After all,

30:46.012 --> 30:47.213
if your father Cassius

30:47.246 --> 30:48.881
had fought a little harder,

30:48.915 --> 30:51.150
he wouldn't be sharing
an 11-by-seven-foot cell.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.186
So, go get your warrant,
and when you come back,

30:54.220 --> 30:55.587
I'll give you a specimen

30:55.621 --> 30:58.290
and tell you some stories
about old man Pride

30:58.324 --> 31:00.559
that'll make your head spin.

31:07.399 --> 31:10.302
PRIDE:
Make sure this boat
doesn't leave the city,

31:10.336 --> 31:12.171
headed for international waters.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.240
We all know how you Hamiltons
like to evade arrest.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.908
Look, Dwayne.

31:15.942 --> 31:19.511
My father is a violent, drunk,
racist son of a bitch.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.448
But I do not believe
that he's capable of murder.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.217
Why risk letting a woman die
without knowing the truth

31:25.251 --> 31:26.919
about what happened
to her husband?

31:26.953 --> 31:29.221
Because sons protect
their fathers.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.257
That's what they do.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.361
Not all sons.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.932
I didn't choose
to live with the doubt

31:39.966 --> 31:41.467
of who my father really was.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.938
You got an opportunity
to learn the truth.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.708
So I'm running the hair
from the brush

31:49.741 --> 31:51.410
Councilman Hamilton
took from his father

31:51.443 --> 31:54.713
against the blood that we
found inside of Jacob's gun.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.448
The results should
be coming up here

31:56.482 --> 31:59.385
in three, two, one...

32:00.452 --> 32:02.388
It's not a match.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.457
So, Tom Hamilton's
not the killer?

32:07.126 --> 32:09.461
It seems that having
hateful views

32:09.495 --> 32:12.098
doesn't necessarily
make you a liar.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.465
All these years,
I've been looking at this case

32:13.499 --> 32:15.301
from the same point of view.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.303
That the racists
must be hiding something.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.370
Now we know

32:18.404 --> 32:19.671
Brick Myers-- too tall.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.308
Tom Hamilton's
blood doesn't match.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.609
So...

32:23.642 --> 32:26.445
what if they are
telling the truth

32:26.478 --> 32:28.614
and it's the journal

32:28.647 --> 32:31.483
that's been lying all along?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.385
What's this?

32:33.419 --> 32:35.187
Jacob Tarlow's last entry

32:35.221 --> 32:37.356
after the fight
with the Brigade.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.691
Everything in it suggests
that Jacob's death is related

32:39.725 --> 32:42.594
to what happened that day.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.497
But maybe the journal
is a cover.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.100
And the people
he should've been afraid of

32:48.134 --> 32:49.768
were much closer.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.504
Who had access to the journal

32:52.538 --> 32:54.340
between the time Jacob died

32:54.373 --> 32:57.209
and when the coroner's office
first saw it?

32:57.243 --> 32:59.445
His brother Esau.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.747
And his best friend Paul.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.283
Sometimes

33:04.316 --> 33:07.486
hate has nothing
to do with color.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.771
Tell me things.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.139
The medical company that
ships Hannah's medication

33:27.173 --> 33:28.740
faxed over their signature logs.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.676
Paul and Esau have signed

33:30.709 --> 33:33.445
for Hannah's prescription
in the last six months.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.746
Do you have...?
Jacob's journal?

33:34.780 --> 33:36.248
Yes. Thank you.

33:36.282 --> 33:39.218
We will scan it
and compare

33:39.251 --> 33:41.587
Jacob's last entry

33:41.620 --> 33:44.723
to Esau and Paul's handwriting
from the signature logs.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.760
Where are Paul and Esau now?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.429
Headed to Hannah's.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.764
We told them to gather everyone
to give them an update.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.674
It's okay.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.810
I'll get it.

34:05.644 --> 34:06.845
WADE:
Hi.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.714
Hi. Come on in.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.653
Hey, Paul.
Come over here for a second.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.328
You know who Jacob's killer is?

34:22.361 --> 34:23.729
We think we do.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.444
Paul?

34:39.811 --> 34:41.780
Why?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.663
High-stakes gamble.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.165
Relying on the cesspool of hate

34:59.198 --> 35:01.700
to cover up the murder
of your best friend.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.336
Jacob's Navy journal.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.205
And the writing
is an exact match

35:06.238 --> 35:08.407
to when you signed
for Hannah's medication.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.875
PRIDE:
Like your DNA

35:09.908 --> 35:13.412
will match the blood found
on the inside of Jacob's gun.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.547
Must have been hard.

35:15.581 --> 35:18.617
With Hannah leaning
on you all these years

35:18.650 --> 35:20.919
but never accepting
your hand in marriage.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.756
Miriam told us...
that you proposed

35:24.790 --> 35:27.793
to Hannah several times
after Jacob's death.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.596
But she never did say yes.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.499
Leaving you to live
in the shadows.

35:36.735 --> 35:40.206
Yeah, we-we had
one night together.

35:40.239 --> 35:43.909
Right before they were engaged.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.777
And I told Hannah
that she had

35:45.811 --> 35:49.448
to choose between
me and Jacob.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.318
But she said we were a mistake.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.787
She made me swear
never to say a thing.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.626
But after what happened
with the Brigade...

36:00.659 --> 36:02.694
after...

36:02.728 --> 36:05.864
escaping with our lives...

36:05.897 --> 36:07.933
I had to tell Jacob.

36:07.966 --> 36:11.803
I told him that Hannah and I
were meant to be together.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.706
Not him and her.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.245
And then things just, uh,
got out of hand.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.549
It was an accident.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.951
Swear.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.855
Accident or not...
still murder.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.796
Now we know the truth.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.220
How you gonna sleep tonight?

37:04.290 --> 37:06.292
Like a baby.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.434
My father was trying
to get home to my mother.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.637
Oh, and to you, too.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.309
And to me.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.919
The Secretary of the
Navy is ordering Paul

37:33.952 --> 37:36.355
back to active duty to face

37:36.388 --> 37:39.391
murder charges
at court martial.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.027
Thank you.

37:42.060 --> 37:46.365
But I'd rather not ever
think of Paul Hare again.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.934
I made... one mistake,

37:48.967 --> 37:51.303
and it deprived me of so much.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.611
I miss Jacob's laugh.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.481
I look forward to being
with him again.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.559
Sometimes you don't want it
to be a big deal.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.028
But it is.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.464
And sometimes...

38:54.099 --> 38:57.135
...you say you're
not sure how you feel

38:57.168 --> 39:00.906
when you know exactly.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.710
It's so intense
it terrifies you.

39:06.412 --> 39:08.580
I really like him.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.616
I know.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.418
And I sent him away.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.953
You did.

39:14.986 --> 39:18.056
And I screwed up.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.959
Big-time.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.064
And sometimes

39:26.097 --> 39:28.767
it's not such a terrible thing

39:28.800 --> 39:32.638
when your father has a bromance
with your boyfriend.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.110
Oh, hang on.
A little eyelash.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.546
Mm-hmm.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.758
Hey.

39:52.791 --> 39:53.992
Hey.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.064
WADE:
Pie's ready.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.966
Pie's here.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.034
Hi.
Hey, Loretta!

40:03.068 --> 40:05.070
You ready to give
the greens championship trophy

40:05.103 --> 40:05.904
to yours truly?
Oh!

40:05.937 --> 40:08.674
Now is not the time
for competition.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.208
It's the season of thankfulness.

40:10.241 --> 40:10.809
Okay, y'all.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.611
Listen, listen, everyone.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.212
Let me just say, you know,

40:14.245 --> 40:17.649
it has been an interesting
last few days.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.751
A 40-year-old murder

40:19.785 --> 40:23.889
reminds me how much
the world has changed.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.024
With work still to be done.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.926
But tonight...

40:27.959 --> 40:30.796
we're here to break
bread together

40:30.829 --> 40:32.731
and remember

40:32.764 --> 40:35.100
that love done right

40:35.133 --> 40:37.636
can change the world.

40:37.669 --> 40:38.770
Amen.

40:38.804 --> 40:39.771
ALL:
Amen.

40:39.805 --> 40:40.872
Cheers.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.541
Cheers, guys.
Cheers to that.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.810
Yeah!

40:44.843 --> 40:46.745
Orion?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.779
Yes, sir?

40:47.813 --> 40:50.616
Would you care to do the honors?

40:53.985 --> 40:55.787
Big man on campus now.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.656
Wow. Thank you.
That's right.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.024
You got this.
Oh, my word.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.126
I remember what you did
to the bird last year.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.728
Oh!

41:02.761 --> 41:05.130
All right, somebody
pass me the greens!

41:05.163 --> 41:06.865
Oh, here you go.
Here's the winner.
