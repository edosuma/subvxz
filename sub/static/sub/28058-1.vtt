08:18.346 --> 08:20.846
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop myself.

No, I'm not mad. I thought told

08:26.221 --> 08:28.353
<i>No, I told you that I was gonna

08:44.972 --> 08:47.206
What the hell were you doing?

08:47.208 --> 08:49.144
I smashed
the bastard's window.

08:50.511 --> 08:52.778
What'd you use?
You use a, a rock?

08:52.780 --> 08:55.717
- No. I used a shovel.
- Yes, sir.

08:58.253 --> 08:59.685
I'm hungry.

08:59.687 --> 09:01.186
Go and take your sister
outside for a second.

09:01.188 --> 09:02.321
We're gonna get ready.

09:02.323 --> 09:04.290
'Cause we're gonna be
goin' soon, okay?

09:04.292 --> 09:06.461
We're just gonna pack up

I'm sorry.

11:32.539 --> 11:35.440
Hey.
You want it? You want it?

11:35.442 --> 11:37.477
Nope, you missed it.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.478
It's time to move out.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.448
<i>Huh?</i>

11:47.389 --> 11:49.825
- It's time to get in the car.
- <i>Come here.</i>

12:25.994 --> 12:27.262
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

12:46.980 --> 12:48.781
Take a last look.

12:48.783 --> 12:50.885
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:52.052 --> 12:53.989
I'm gonna buy us a house
somewhere else.

12:54.688 --> 12:56.625
What if you lose?

12:58.826 --> 13:00.095
I can't lose.

13:39.399 --> 13:40.701
Evenin', Ed.

13:43.104 --> 13:45.040
Place still shutting down
end of next week?

13:46.740 --> 13:50.345
The, uh, law came around
looking for you.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.982
<i>So what's next for you?</i>

13:55.984 --> 13:57.920
<i>You got big plans
on the horizon?</i>

13:59.653 --> 14:00.923
Go fuck yourself.

14:06.528 --> 14:08.127
<i>Let's go check the house.</i>

14:36.291 --> 14:38.227
What you need that for?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.400
I don't fucking deserve this
from a couple of fucking

14:47.402 --> 14:49.338
meth heads in charge
of this shit.

15:06.587 --> 15:08.588
Maybe he's in a better
place now.

15:46.995 --> 15:49.264
Delia, beautiful, you want some?

15:50.465 --> 15:52.134
Did you say you grew up
in this house?

15:52.966 --> 15:54.733
I did indeed.

15:54.735 --> 15:57.538
And you could spend as much time
here as you want.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.342
So what you say, Eldon?

16:02.342 --> 16:03.611
You gonna front us?

16:05.279 --> 16:07.615
Oh. Where are my manners?

16:13.921 --> 16:16.592
But you still owe me for that
last batch so..

16:22.029 --> 16:24.597
Went up in flames, Eldon.

16:24.599 --> 16:27.098
Yeah, I know, but th... that's
got nothing to do with me.

16:27.100 --> 16:32.405
I mean, I'm down 20Gs to some
very unforgiving types

16:32.407 --> 16:34.507
and I... I need that money.

16:34.509 --> 16:36.443
You gotta pay up.

16:39.514 --> 16:40.481
Uh..

16:42.250 --> 16:43.983
I mean, these people
that I'm into

16:43.985 --> 16:47.822
they're... not to be fucked with.

16:49.724 --> 16:52.728
Unlike this sweet young
lady here.

17:01.903 --> 17:05.106
Oh, I'm telling you, man,
I... I can't front it.

17:05.707 --> 17:06.708
Hell no.

17:09.977 --> 17:10.912
No!

17:14.048 --> 17:16.348
<i>Under the covers. Come on.</i>

17:16.351 --> 17:17.618
<i>There you go.</i>

17:18.486 --> 17:20.685
<i>Mm..</i>

17:20.688 --> 17:22.654
<i>...I'll miss you.</i>

17:22.656 --> 17:24.592
Don't forget to kiss Dolly.

17:26.693 --> 17:29.463
I love you, Dolly.
You sleep good, okay?

17:34.434 --> 17:36.869
Give them hell
at the Donnybrook.

17:36.871 --> 17:38.140
I will, baby.

17:39.039 --> 17:40.940
I will.

17:40.942 --> 17:42.877
- I will.
- I know you will.

17:45.212 --> 17:46.480
Here's the money.

18:00.827 --> 18:02.294
Okay, you got the money here.
Okay?

18:02.296 --> 18:04.399
Your cousin will be here
in the mornin'.

18:07.234 --> 18:10.102
You should both stay inside
until he gets here, okay?

18:10.104 --> 18:11.105
I will.

18:15.843 --> 18:18.576
<i>I'm gonna make all this better
for us.</i>

18:18.578 --> 18:20.682
<i>I'm gonna get you
a good doctor.</i>

18:22.549 --> 18:24.819
I'm gonna take you
to a treatment center.

18:25.987 --> 18:27.585
I'm going to be waiting for you.

18:27.587 --> 18:29.521
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna give it your all.

18:29.523 --> 18:32.091
You're gonna give it
your goddamn best shot you got.

18:32.093 --> 18:33.061
Okay.

18:34.662 --> 18:36.661
You be good now.

18:36.663 --> 18:38.599
You want to say goodbye
to your mom?

18:43.471 --> 18:45.371
You sure you don't want
to stay behind?

18:45.373 --> 18:46.838
We already talked about this.

18:49.443 --> 18:50.412
Hm?

18:56.616 --> 18:59.384
<i>So you'll think of us.</i>

18:59.386 --> 19:01.786
You know, sometimes I like
to hold it up to my eyes

19:01.788 --> 19:04.393
and it makes everything look
all rosy.

19:07.127 --> 19:10.563
Bye. I'll call you
from the road.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.430
Okay?

19:12.432 --> 19:14.435
Come on. Get your coat.

19:17.838 --> 19:20.171
I love you.
You dream about me.

19:21.342 --> 19:24.112
- You better. Go on.
- I will.

19:59.980 --> 20:00.981
Take it.

20:01.715 --> 20:02.983
Look at me.

20:04.951 --> 20:06.221
You do good.

20:17.365 --> 20:18.633
I'll be outside.

20:21.501 --> 20:23.067
<i>Oh.</i>

20:28.276 --> 20:29.211
Ah.

21:28.368 --> 21:29.336
Oh..

22:01.501 --> 22:02.470
Yeah.

22:04.638 --> 22:06.040
Yeah.

22:09.910 --> 22:12.346
You should kill him
with that gun and not me.

22:33.567 --> 22:35.734
- Okay.
- Yeah?

22:35.736 --> 22:38.036
- Go ahead.
- Oh, God, yeah.

22:38.038 --> 22:39.138
Oh, my God, I'm gonna..

22:39.140 --> 22:40.939
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah, uh..

23:50.845 --> 23:53.778
What do you think?

23:53.780 --> 23:55.613
I think the whole world's
gone to hell.

24:20.907 --> 24:23.709
Come here. Shell casings.
Scoop that up.

24:23.711 --> 24:25.947
Shell casings. Scoop that up.

24:36.289 --> 24:38.623
Not a stretch to think the
brothers here fell asleep

24:38.625 --> 24:41.559
on a cook... turned into
human barbecue

24:41.561 --> 24:44.465
and then got shot for fucking up
this quarter's earnings.

24:45.165 --> 24:46.166
<i>Okay.</i>

24:50.371 --> 24:53.007
Bag the meat. I'll be doing
my nails in the truck.

24:59.078 --> 25:00.912
We good here?

25:00.914 --> 25:03.585
You, uh,
want me to call in State?

25:04.585 --> 25:05.886
What you got there?

25:07.354 --> 25:10.125
Found those on the one
that didn't get all burnt up.

25:20.201 --> 25:21.767
Tell you what,
I'm headed back to the station.

25:21.769 --> 25:23.704
I'll drop it off.

25:27.106 --> 25:29.042
It's a short drive, Potts.

25:32.278 --> 25:33.548
You okay, Donny?

25:36.851 --> 25:37.819
No.

25:38.818 --> 25:40.254
No, not really.

26:15.355 --> 26:17.458
This ain't your grandfather's
weapon. I'll tell you that.

26:18.392 --> 26:20.061
Lucky he didn't steal this, too.

26:21.394 --> 26:23.996
I'll get you a deal on it.
Whatever you want.

26:23.998 --> 26:25.796
Donny, I need the money now.

26:27.468 --> 26:28.836
My, uh..

26:29.470 --> 26:32.004
My wife, uh..

26:32.006 --> 26:33.875
She's pissed.

26:40.847 --> 26:43.047
What did you say he looked like?

26:43.049 --> 26:45.517
I already told whoever answers
the damn phone over there

26:45.519 --> 26:47.055
who stole the shit.

26:48.087 --> 26:49.923
It was Jarhead Earl.

26:50.758 --> 26:51.726
Yeah.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.931
He took a whole grand in
a plastic bag.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.504
That's just enough to get him
to the Donnybrook.

27:06.373 --> 27:09.474
The best I can give you is, uh..

27:09.476 --> 27:11.910
This kid catches a beating
or a bullet.

27:11.912 --> 27:13.612
Besides, there's worse things
in the world

27:13.614 --> 27:16.280
than a vet trying
to win a fight

27:16.282 --> 27:18.552
and pull himself up by
the bootstraps.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.990
Hey. That's my last one, man.

27:23.656 --> 27:25.592
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

27:26.559 --> 27:29.297
Take any.. Whatever you want..

27:38.071 --> 27:40.274
Okay, let's pull up here, just..

27:41.775 --> 27:43.011
Come on, come on.

27:44.243 --> 27:45.876
- Why have we stopped?
- Hang on, hang on.

27:45.878 --> 27:46.911
It's just the car.

28:13.106 --> 28:14.841
No... no, re... reach in
and try now.

28:15.843 --> 28:17.642
- Now? Anything?
- No.

28:17.644 --> 28:19.811
- Is it sparkin'?
- No.

28:19.813 --> 28:22.381
Okay. Come over here.

28:22.383 --> 28:23.949
Flag it down.
I'll flag it down.

28:23.951 --> 28:25.653
You get in the car.
Get in the car.

28:35.194 --> 28:38.063
- Evenin'.
- Evenin', officer.

28:38.065 --> 28:39.296
Need a jump?

28:39.298 --> 28:41.232
Yeah, well..

28:41.234 --> 28:43.768
We might need a ride,
the, uh..

28:43.770 --> 28:45.472
The car's done for.

28:54.414 --> 28:55.682
Where're you headin'?

28:56.650 --> 28:59.084
I was headed up county.

28:59.086 --> 29:02.120
We got family up there,
so I'm just..

29:02.122 --> 29:03.391
...gonna see them.

29:07.994 --> 29:09.227
Let's see the license
and registration.

29:09.229 --> 29:10.498
Yes, sir. Yes.

29:22.142 --> 29:24.578
Just, uh.. Just..

29:25.345 --> 29:27.280
It's, it's all in order.

29:28.015 --> 29:29.046
Just..

29:35.189 --> 29:36.988
Get everything in the other car.

29:36.990 --> 29:38.422
Take everything, the bags,
everything.

29:38.424 --> 29:40.360
Get in the other car. Go.

29:58.979 --> 30:01.446
Hey. You did good.
You did good.

30:01.448 --> 30:02.717
You did good.

30:03.383 --> 30:04.317
Alright.

31:58.965 --> 32:00.901
You make me sick.

33:09.502 --> 33:11.803
Alright, I'm not fucking nutty.

33:11.805 --> 33:12.937
I'm not fucking nutty.

33:12.939 --> 33:14.275
Fuckin'..

33:43.336 --> 33:46.638
You know, we gotta ditch
the cop car..

33:46.640 --> 33:48.576
...figure out a new vehicle.

33:55.548 --> 33:56.815
What's up?

33:56.817 --> 33:59.284
- Nothin'.
- <i>What's the face for, then?</i>

33:59.286 --> 34:00.287
No reason.

34:07.861 --> 34:09.797
You know that cop car?

34:11.831 --> 34:13.833
That was pretty sweet.

34:15.235 --> 34:16.266
Hit.

34:16.268 --> 34:18.001
The way you hit that, too.

34:18.003 --> 34:19.005
That's right.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.005
I'll hold the bag.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.675
Here you go.

34:23.677 --> 34:25.577
Hit that left.
Now get that right.

34:25.579 --> 34:26.744
Now get that hip into it.

34:26.746 --> 34:28.214
Get the hip into it.

34:29.715 --> 34:31.382
Alright. That's it.

34:31.385 --> 34:34.518
- Hurts, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:34.521 --> 34:35.456
It hurts.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.991
We don't have to do anymore.

35:04.951 --> 35:05.920
Sarah.

35:07.653 --> 35:09.086
Hi.

35:09.088 --> 35:10.688
It's okay.

35:10.690 --> 35:12.724
Hi, look, I... I don't...
I don't need anything.

35:12.726 --> 35:14.291
I'm just..
I'm working right now.

35:14.293 --> 35:17.297
I just.. I just..
I just wanted to see you.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.566
- What?
- I'm trying.

35:22.568 --> 35:24.969
What? I had a beer.

35:24.971 --> 35:27.171
I.. Sarah, I'm trying. Okay?

35:27.173 --> 35:28.405
I can't even remember
the last time

35:28.407 --> 35:30.641
I messed with that other shit.

35:30.643 --> 35:32.644
Okay, I know you hate me.

35:32.646 --> 35:34.077
Can't you just stop
and talk to me for a second?

35:34.079 --> 35:36.016
Angus came by my house, Don.

35:38.818 --> 35:40.784
When?

35:40.786 --> 35:43.320
A couple of times.
With his sister.

35:43.322 --> 35:45.759
Wanted to know if there
are any customers still around.

35:47.494 --> 35:49.793
Did he hurt you?

35:49.795 --> 35:51.898
Hey! Did he hurt you?

35:53.065 --> 35:55.335
No. You did.

35:56.969 --> 35:58.238
Let me go.

36:00.206 --> 36:02.143
Let me go! Let me go!

36:39.778 --> 36:41.715
Betting that's a .380.

36:43.315 --> 36:46.517
His brother was
a classmate of mine.

36:46.519 --> 36:49.056
He was a good guy
until he drank his liver black.

36:50.623 --> 36:53.560
Little Eldon.
He was the pride of the family.

37:00.699 --> 37:01.634
Hey.

37:03.003 --> 37:04.869
DNA too.

37:04.871 --> 37:06.807
I know who he was fucking.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.216
Will you take that
fucking mask off?

37:18.518 --> 37:20.954
Eldon gets the same bullet
as the tweaky brothers.

37:22.454 --> 37:24.755
Angus is setting to cook
a new batch somewhere.

37:24.757 --> 37:26.359
So write it up?

37:27.293 --> 37:28.561
Motherfucker.

37:29.896 --> 37:32.166
He is the reason
everything's going to hell.

37:33.632 --> 37:35.599
What you gonna do?

37:35.601 --> 37:37.036
I'm gonna find him.

41:20.659 --> 41:22.559
Who'd Eldon owe money to?

41:22.561 --> 41:24.362
That I don't know.

41:24.364 --> 41:26.300
- You don't know?
- No.

41:28.101 --> 41:30.635
Well, then,
how about this one?

41:30.637 --> 41:32.573
Where's Angus right now?

41:34.072 --> 41:35.842
Cookin' somewhere, surely.

41:36.643 --> 41:38.077
That's helpful.

41:39.378 --> 41:41.479
How much powder were those
moron brothers holding?

41:41.481 --> 41:43.680
That's none of your business.

41:43.682 --> 41:46.219
Besides, I thought
I'd be the one to ask questions.

41:47.119 --> 41:49.056
If that's alright with you.

41:50.389 --> 41:52.326
Angus is the devil, man.

41:53.726 --> 41:55.662
I'd just leave him alone.

41:59.632 --> 42:02.702
Well, somebody's got to kill
the devil now.

42:04.637 --> 42:05.905
Ain't that right?

42:06.873 --> 42:07.974
Besides..

42:10.076 --> 42:12.012
...what else am I gonna do?

42:18.684 --> 42:20.788
I bet you're still holding
some of that powder.

42:41.541 --> 42:44.041
Ooh! Yeah!

42:55.454 --> 42:57.391
Get the fuck out of my car.

43:37.563 --> 43:39.532
Fuck you.

43:41.900 --> 43:44.101
Preach this.

43:44.103 --> 43:46.807
Give me. Give me it all.
Give me it all.

43:50.076 --> 43:51.141
Fuck you, motherfucker!

43:53.346 --> 43:57.280
- Where's Angus?
- I... I... I don't know.

43:57.282 --> 43:59.219
Where the fuck is he?

44:17.637 --> 44:19.704
- Hey, now, don't..
- What?

44:19.706 --> 44:21.639
Come on. Enough.

44:21.641 --> 44:23.577
That's enough of that.

44:33.753 --> 44:36.023
Are you gonna win
that Donnybrook?

44:37.489 --> 44:38.789
Think I got a shot?

44:38.791 --> 44:40.227
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- You do?

44:41.293 --> 44:43.661
They'll literally
have to kill me.

44:43.663 --> 44:46.296
And if they couldn't kill me
over there

44:46.298 --> 44:48.567
they're sure as hell
not going to kill me over here.

44:49.936 --> 44:50.938
Yes, sir.

44:53.873 --> 44:56.143
Now get some sleep, will you?
Goddamn.

46:57.663 --> 46:58.632
Hi.

46:59.398 --> 47:00.430
Hi.

47:42.875 --> 47:44.874
Are you alright there?

47:44.876 --> 47:46.813
Uh, it broke down a ways back.

47:47.847 --> 47:50.146
Is that a limp you got?

47:50.148 --> 47:51.916
I picked that up
in Afghanistan.

47:51.918 --> 47:53.854
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

47:54.719 --> 47:56.655
You need a ride, soldier?

47:57.356 --> 47:58.358
Yes, sir.

47:59.724 --> 48:01.661
Hoping to meet up
with my sister.

48:06.699 --> 48:07.967
Sister, huh?

48:08.733 --> 48:10.336
Older or younger?

48:12.672 --> 48:14.106
Much younger.

48:16.842 --> 48:19.443
A little sister.
That's just great.

48:19.445 --> 48:21.778
Bet you spend half your life

48:21.780 --> 48:24.049
trying to keep
the boys off her.

48:25.117 --> 48:26.553
<i>Something like that.</i>

48:27.820 --> 48:30.387
Just like my son did.

48:30.389 --> 48:32.325
He's done real well.

48:33.659 --> 48:35.758
Wife..

48:35.760 --> 48:39.429
...four kids. My grand kids.

48:39.431 --> 48:41.699
<i>At this point
I just have to pinch myself.</i>

48:41.701 --> 48:44.304
<i>I mean, how big a success
can this kid be?</i>

48:45.471 --> 48:47.604
<i>Where's it come from?</i>

48:47.606 --> 48:50.507
<i>College? High school?</i>

48:50.509 --> 48:53.413
Military, like yourself there.
I mean, where?

48:55.280 --> 48:56.549
I don't know.

48:59.452 --> 49:00.554
I do.

49:02.788 --> 49:05.389
Success is something you build

49:05.391 --> 49:08.726
long before a... a promotion
or a job.

49:08.728 --> 49:10.226
It's... it's..

49:10.228 --> 49:11.997
It's generations deep.

49:14.032 --> 49:16.036
How you take care
of your family.

49:17.670 --> 49:21.775
<i>How you care for the ones
that are closest to you.</i>

49:24.376 --> 49:26.079
That's where it starts.

49:33.818 --> 49:35.818
Would you mind pulling over up
here? I gotta take a piss.

49:35.820 --> 49:37.089
Oh, sure.

49:50.936 --> 49:52.872
What are you gonna do
with that?

50:06.452 --> 50:08.388
That's what I call success.

51:35.440 --> 51:37.307
<i>Where are we going?</i>

51:37.309 --> 51:39.510
<i>We're looking for a fight.</i>

51:39.512 --> 51:42.782
<i>We're down, so gotta
make a crack somehow.</i>

51:44.349 --> 51:46.952
<i>Now, you're gonna stay here,
just like we said, okay?</i>

52:16.081 --> 52:17.684
I'm looking for a fight.

52:19.385 --> 52:21.385
- I'll get a beer.
- Yeah, I got you.

52:31.297 --> 52:32.565
$2.50.

52:57.489 --> 52:59.389
<i>Ah, is that the pot, fellas?</i>

52:59.391 --> 53:00.393
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

53:03.795 --> 53:05.829
Come on, pussy.
I got plans later.

53:05.831 --> 53:07.164
<i>Pick a man.</i>

53:10.268 --> 53:11.767
- Come on..
- Go get 'em!

53:27.552 --> 53:29.686
- <i>Come on, man!</i>
- <i>Come on, Wolf.</i>

53:29.688 --> 53:31.291
<i>Show him what you're made of.</i>

53:43.936 --> 53:44.967
<i>Get up, pussy!</i>

53:51.777 --> 53:53.709
<i>You gotta take that shit!</i>

53:53.711 --> 53:55.414
<i>Get up, pussy!</i>

53:58.918 --> 54:00.854
Get up, big guy. Come on.

54:08.561 --> 54:10.927
- <i>Wow!</i>
- <i>What a man!</i>

54:10.929 --> 54:12.396
Take that down, killer.

54:12.398 --> 54:14.298
Bad! Man..

54:14.300 --> 54:15.898
You ever hear
of the Donnybrook?

54:15.900 --> 54:17.534
Yeah, yeah.

54:17.536 --> 54:20.103
That's where we're headed.
Semper?

54:20.105 --> 54:23.072
Semper Fi. Name's Poe.

54:23.074 --> 54:25.010
Promoter's fee, mind you.

54:25.610 --> 54:27.510
<i>Cops!</i>

54:27.512 --> 54:29.545
- <i>Where?</i>
- Inside.

54:29.547 --> 54:31.248
What?

54:31.250 --> 54:33.186
I got a truck.

54:36.454 --> 54:38.454
Let's go, okay.

55:33.545 --> 55:35.545
What is this?

55:35.547 --> 55:37.150
I keep an office.

55:42.221 --> 55:44.157
<i>You want a beer?
They're cold.</i>

55:45.257 --> 55:47.023
Thank you.

55:47.025 --> 55:49.358
Do you got a phone? I just need
to check in with the wife.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.297
<i>Yeah. Be my guest.</i>

55:55.333 --> 55:56.301
Thanks.

56:06.844 --> 56:07.943
<i>Good evening.</i>

56:07.945 --> 56:09.445
Hey, lady, how're you doing?

56:09.447 --> 56:10.947
<i>Hey, daddy.</i>

56:13.418 --> 56:14.950
You sound tired.
Are you okay?

56:14.952 --> 56:16.686
Mama's bad.

56:16.688 --> 56:18.954
<i>She is? You want to put her
on the phone for me, baby?</i>

56:18.956 --> 56:21.023
- Just hold.
- <i>Hey, Scout.</i>

56:21.025 --> 56:22.159
Yeah.

56:22.161 --> 56:24.097
<i>You still ready for Candy Land?</i>

56:25.097 --> 56:26.099
Born ready.

56:30.068 --> 56:31.036
Jar?

56:33.438 --> 56:35.204
- Did you win?
- <i>No, we're not there yet.</i>

56:35.206 --> 56:37.143
<i>We still got a ways to go.</i>

56:42.114 --> 56:44.050
You should come and get us soon.

56:47.452 --> 56:49.385
Okay, baby.

56:49.387 --> 56:51.121
<i>I love you, Jar.</i>

56:51.123 --> 56:53.322
Okay. I gotta go.

56:53.324 --> 56:54.791
I love you so much.

56:54.793 --> 56:57.930
You devil. You didn't mention
you had a girl with you.

57:01.400 --> 57:02.699
- Did she come alone?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

57:02.701 --> 57:04.700
Who's she with?
Did you see anyone with?

57:04.702 --> 57:06.038
I don't know. Why?

57:10.007 --> 57:11.943
Where the hell you come from?

57:12.911 --> 57:14.945
I saw you at the bar.

57:14.947 --> 57:16.345
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

57:16.347 --> 57:17.380
I knew you were going
to the Donnybrook.

57:17.382 --> 57:19.318
<i>I thought we could pair up.</i>

57:20.452 --> 57:22.388
Watch each other's back.

57:23.789 --> 57:25.725
Where's your brother?

57:27.826 --> 57:29.094
He's gone.

57:31.163 --> 57:32.130
<i>Cops.</i>

57:57.856 --> 57:59.459
Proposition for you.

58:01.226 --> 58:03.827
You got no vehicle,
no safe place to stay.

58:03.829 --> 58:06.265
You're still a day's journey
from McGill's plot of land.

58:08.166 --> 58:09.434
Who's McGill?

58:10.501 --> 58:11.967
The Nazi who runs Donnybrook.

58:11.969 --> 58:13.470
So?

58:13.472 --> 58:15.005
So I get you out of here,
stash the boy safe

58:15.007 --> 58:17.072
for a couple days
and get you to the brook.

58:17.074 --> 58:18.108
<i>Like hell.
I'm staying with you.</i>

58:18.110 --> 58:20.075
No.

58:20.077 --> 58:23.579
Don't you worry about it. We're
gonna figure this out, okay?

58:23.581 --> 58:25.518
<i>Donnybrook's no place
for a kid.</i>

58:32.257 --> 58:34.356
Alright, what do you want
from me?

58:34.358 --> 58:36.126
You win, then we peel off more
of that pot.

58:36.128 --> 58:38.360
Like tonight, promoter's fee.

58:39.697 --> 58:42.164
If you stay here,
nothing but handcuffs for you

58:42.166 --> 58:44.300
juvie for him.

58:44.302 --> 58:45.403
<i>I can go with.</i>

58:47.505 --> 58:49.405
When I get to the Donnybrook,
I can just sell

58:49.407 --> 58:51.344
what's in this bag
and disappear.

58:57.782 --> 58:59.050
What's his name?

59:00.452 --> 59:01.420
<i>Moses.</i>

59:09.795 --> 59:11.528
Is this it?

59:11.530 --> 59:12.798
This is it.

59:17.001 --> 59:19.269
My guy's boat won't have
a trace of a cruiser to it.

59:19.271 --> 59:21.207
It'll look like you're
on the river fishing.

59:22.206 --> 59:24.143
- Smoke?
- I don't smoke.

59:33.385 --> 59:34.987
Been waiting for you.

59:53.704 --> 59:54.973
This is Ann.

59:55.641 --> 59:57.474
Hi.

59:57.476 --> 59:59.412
We ain't got no more blankets.

01:00:01.079 --> 01:00:03.015
That's alright. This is fine.

01:00:04.815 --> 01:00:06.751
We'll head out tomorrow.

01:00:08.552 --> 01:00:10.489
The boy'll be alright
with her.

01:00:12.623 --> 01:00:14.559
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Hm.

01:00:16.929 --> 01:00:19.362
Don't thank me yet.
We still have to discuss a fee.

01:00:19.364 --> 01:00:20.632
<i>If that's alright?</i>

01:00:22.333 --> 01:00:23.301
Yeah.

01:00:24.869 --> 01:00:26.972
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.043
<i>There's a pillow here if you
want to lay down or something.</i>

01:01:42.246 --> 01:01:43.515
Single or double?

01:01:44.949 --> 01:01:46.217
Where is she?

01:01:56.427 --> 01:01:57.429
One more.

01:02:08.273 --> 01:02:10.209
I haven't seen her, man.

01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:21.486
To my sister.

01:02:22.788 --> 01:02:24.287
Delia.

01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:25.421
Let me just..

01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:33.032
<i>She'll be back tonight, man.</i>

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.750
<i>Donny?</i>

01:02:57.922 --> 01:02:59.121
What do you want?

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.391
<i>I called you a bunch, boss.</i>

01:03:01.393 --> 01:03:03.226
I gotta repeat the question?

01:03:03.228 --> 01:03:05.164
<i>The girl was spotted.</i>

01:03:06.364 --> 01:03:07.896
The girl?

01:03:07.898 --> 01:03:10.032
<i>The girl Delia.
With Jarhead Earl.</i>

01:03:10.034 --> 01:03:12.471
<i>Scrapping at a bar on their way
to the Donnybrook.</i>

01:03:16.007 --> 01:03:17.606
No Angus?

01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:19.545
<i>Gotta be close by, I figure.</i>

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:24.083
You got a name for this bar?

01:03:32.056 --> 01:03:33.324
Single or double?

01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:43.536
I know the man who did that
to your face.

01:03:46.338 --> 01:03:48.003
Well, have at him.

01:03:48.005 --> 01:03:50.275
Maniac stole my truck
and my Weatherby too.

01:03:51.775 --> 01:03:54.077
His looking for his sister.

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:56.445
She was selling crank couple
evenings here

01:03:56.447 --> 01:03:58.049
peaked his interest.

01:03:59.217 --> 01:04:01.885
Girl is long gone,
but I told him

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:03.920
she'd be back tonight.

01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:05.722
He'll come around.

01:04:05.724 --> 01:04:07.660
Gives me a chance
to get my shit back.

01:04:27.445 --> 01:04:29.381
I'll be in the parking lot.

01:05:50.027 --> 01:05:51.629
<i>Ready, motherfucker?</i>

01:06:26.164 --> 01:06:28.100
You're looking for me, deputy?

01:06:30.068 --> 01:06:32.004
What the fuck are you
looking at?

01:06:33.103 --> 01:06:35.039
I'm looking at a dead man.

01:06:41.246 --> 01:06:42.248
Me too.

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:24.746
<i>Wasn't looking or anything.</i>

01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:26.018
It's alright.

01:08:32.157 --> 01:08:33.255
It's fine.

01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:35.193
<i>Yeah, I was just, uh..</i>

01:08:38.127 --> 01:08:40.399
There is a blanket right there
if you want it.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:42.801
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:59.752
Scrub up good?

01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:03.352
I highly recommend it.

01:09:06.224 --> 01:09:07.225
<i>A swim?</i>

01:09:10.595 --> 01:09:11.596
That too.

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.211
Why didn't you, uh..

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.712
...take the money?

01:09:31.548 --> 01:09:33.849
Back in my trailer
with your brother?

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.953
I saw you.
You, you saw the bag.

01:09:45.095 --> 01:09:46.697
I don't know why.

01:09:55.172 --> 01:09:57.275
<i>What are you doing here, Delia?</i>

01:10:01.512 --> 01:10:03.114
Going to the Donnybrook.

01:10:14.859 --> 01:10:17.129
I don't know a man
in my life that, um..

01:10:18.863 --> 01:10:20.798
...doesn't want to use me,
you know?

01:10:26.136 --> 01:10:29.240
Then I see the way
that you treat Tammy, you know?

01:10:32.577 --> 01:10:34.210
How you act for your kids.

01:10:38.448 --> 01:10:40.384
I guess it just made me wonder,
you know?

01:10:52.063 --> 01:10:53.664
I'll go check him out.

01:11:43.347 --> 01:11:46.014
You know,
it's just a couple of days.

01:11:46.016 --> 01:11:48.119
We're gonna be riding high back
to those girls.

01:11:58.296 --> 01:12:00.399
You're as strong as they come.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.200
Say it.

01:12:04.202 --> 01:12:05.433
I'm as strong as they come.

01:12:05.435 --> 01:12:06.704
Yes, you are.

01:12:10.041 --> 01:12:11.976
- You gonna be alright?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:13.211 --> 01:12:15.111
You're a good man.

01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:17.115
- Bye. Love you.
- Yeah.

01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:16.440
Ain't far now.

01:13:43.301 --> 01:13:44.569
These bikes yours?

01:13:45.536 --> 01:13:47.139
Can I ride one?

01:16:01.706 --> 01:16:03.141
<i>Ain't you gonna pedal away?</i>

01:16:08.045 --> 01:16:10.379
No, sir. I ain't afraid.

01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:35.370
You comin' in with us?

01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:38.042
No. I'm just the messenger.

01:16:41.779 --> 01:16:43.715
Time for you to fight, son.

01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:46.781
There ain't nothin' left.

01:17:57.787 --> 01:17:59.921
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

01:17:59.923 --> 01:18:02.156
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:18:02.158 --> 01:18:04.159
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

01:18:04.161 --> 01:18:05.460
Fight! Fight! Fight!

01:19:14.765 --> 01:19:16.534
Who brought the fucking dogs?

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.377
You okay?

01:19:29.246 --> 01:19:30.181
Mm.

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.251
Will be.

01:19:45.496 --> 01:19:47.297
Be careful out there.

01:19:52.103 --> 01:19:53.904
You got too much to live for.

01:19:56.873 --> 01:19:58.208
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:23.635
I'll be seeing you.

01:20:53.363 --> 01:20:55.397
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:55.399 --> 01:20:57.102
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:21:26.863 --> 01:21:27.865
No.

01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:31.301
Thanks.

01:22:23.554 --> 01:22:26.955
It's the last thing I got
on here, man, if you want it.

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:28.156
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

01:22:28.158 --> 01:22:29.093
Yeah.

01:24:13.497 --> 01:24:15.166
Fuck!
You won't..

01:26:04.675 --> 01:26:06.444
Blessed be the Lord,
my hope.

01:26:08.578 --> 01:26:11.948

my fingers for war.

Boy put up a hell of a fight.

01:30:51.795 --> 01:30:53.431
You'd have been proud.

01:33:18.608 --> 01:33:21.476

<i>Anyone seen Dolly?</i>

01:34:34.050 --> 01:34:35.886
She's right over here, lady.

01:34:50.699 --> 01:34:53.067
This place really
a battlefield?

01:34:53.069 --> 01:34:56.536
<i>Yes, ma'am.
It's the Civil War.</i>

01:34:56.538 --> 01:34:58.740
The North turned back
General Lee here

01:34:58.742 --> 01:35:01.342
and the South..

01:35:01.344 --> 01:35:03.646
Well, never recovered.

01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:14.490
I wish Moses were here.

01:35:35.878 --> 01:35:37.680
<i>How'd the North do it?</i>

01:35:43.819 --> 01:35:45.389
They fought for it.

01:35:58.734 --> 01:36:00.536
It's the only way
for folks like us.
