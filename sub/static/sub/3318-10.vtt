00:04.270 --> 00:05.637
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:05.639 --> 00:08.607
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:12.111
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.613 --> 00:16.515
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:18.317
To save herself and her people,

00:18.319 --> 00:21.620
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.189
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:26.058
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:28.027
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:30.362
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:34.333
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:34.335 --> 00:37.636
Don't pretend this faith
is so strange to you.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.339
Blood pries:
<i>Your mother's blood</i>
<i>is our blood.</i>

00:40.341 --> 00:43.342
I practice my father's religion.
As do you.

00:43.344 --> 00:46.311
Mary's presence here will
cost you your firstborn.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.513
I will stake my claim on England

00:47.515 --> 00:49.048
And I will marry your son,

00:49.050 --> 00:51.250
But not francis, bash.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.518
Legitimize him
and make him

00:52.520 --> 00:54.486
The next king of France.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.654
<i>You end up with a king</i>

00:55.656 --> 00:58.190
And three kingdoms
under your rule,

00:58.192 --> 00:59.425
And I lose everything!

00:59.427 --> 01:01.093
Imprison her.

01:02.595 --> 01:04.496
I never wanted
my brother's crown.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.632
So will you take it
to save his life?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.468
You are throwing away
everything we had

01:09.470 --> 01:10.636
For superstition!

01:10.638 --> 01:13.439
To the future king
and queen of France,

01:13.441 --> 01:15.374
Scotland and England.

01:17.343 --> 01:18.710
(birds chirping)

01:20.146 --> 01:21.380
(clattering, grunting)

01:22.682 --> 01:25.417
(grunting)

01:26.619 --> 01:28.387
(yells)

01:48.641 --> 01:50.742
(panting)

01:52.545 --> 01:54.813
(grunts)

01:54.815 --> 01:58.684
Learn to expect
the blade you can't see.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.619
Otherwise, it'll be
the last thing

02:00.621 --> 02:01.887
You ever learn.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.757
I thought I might
find you here.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.758
Enjoying yourself?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.594
Did you hear that, alec?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.863
We're supposed to be
enjoying ourselves.

02:10.865 --> 02:13.665
Mm, actually, you're supposed
to be in the throne room.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.667
There was a
royal audience today,

02:15.669 --> 02:17.870
And the acting regent
usually presides.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.471
Lord hugo can manage.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.473
Privy councilors fill in
for father all the time.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.909
Bash, there is a reason that
your father left you in charge.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.145
He needs to know that
you can do the job.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.615
He's gone to rome to have you
legitimized, and if he succeeds,

02:29.617 --> 02:31.717
You will be next in line
for the throne of France.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.486
Which was meant to be
a secret until he got back.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.155
Now the whole
throne room knows,

02:36.157 --> 02:38.223
And they're just waiting
for me to make a mistake.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.691
There is nothing
you can do about that

02:39.693 --> 02:41.593
Except go and do the job.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.630
Mary, the nobles don't care
if I'm up to the job.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.665
I'm a threat to every
legitimate son in the kingdom.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.767
If a bastard is
allowed to take power,

02:48.769 --> 02:51.470
Suddenly their claim
to power is half as strong.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.806
You want me to tell you that
the nobles are on your side?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.341
They're not.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.644
But you won't be
the first king

02:58.646 --> 03:01.513
That's had to subdue
a restive nobility.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.881
You can do it.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.753
So...

03:07.755 --> 03:09.521
Thanks to my father's
lust for England

03:09.523 --> 03:11.190
And your need to
marry a french king,

03:11.192 --> 03:12.691
I have a target
on my back.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.527
Which explains why
my mother sent alec here,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.629
My delightful
new bodyguard.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.864
Alec, I'm glad
you're here.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.433
That makes one of us.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.669
Bash, I know I
backed you into this,

03:23.671 --> 03:25.804
And I'm sorry but...

03:25.806 --> 03:27.339
Don't apologize.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.675
I accepted this
with my eyes open.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.884
Farmer: <i>I could tell it wasn't</i>
<i>worth but two chickens.</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:42.688
But when I went to milk the
goat, she was dry as dust.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.456
And this liar took
four of my chickens,

03:44.458 --> 03:47.526
Good laying chickens,
in trade.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.927
I deserve them
chickens back.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.765
My lord regent...

03:53.767 --> 03:55.701
The good man
is speaking to you.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.002
He seeks the
crown's judgment.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.437
So sorry, lord hugo.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.805
My judgment.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.741
My judgment is that I have

04:02.743 --> 04:04.543
No way of knowing

04:04.545 --> 04:05.911
What this other man
promised or didn't.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.679
But I know that
if you had tried

04:07.681 --> 04:09.681
To milk that goat
before you took her,

04:09.683 --> 04:10.749
There'd be no issue.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.785
So, we'll have
no satisfaction?

04:13.787 --> 04:14.820
Bash:
I suppose not.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.688
Unless you eat the goat

04:16.690 --> 04:18.624
And the taste delights you.
(laughs)

04:18.626 --> 04:20.359
(indistinct chatter)

04:25.632 --> 04:29.701
Well, the regent has
rendered his judgment.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.870
We'll hear
the next complaint!

04:31.872 --> 04:34.940
If I die of boredom while
hearing my people's grievances,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.842
Am I playing into
the queen's hands?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.010
Stop being so flippant.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.579
Your people are trying
to get to know you.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.714
This is important.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.819
My lord regent,

04:47.821 --> 04:50.989
This man claims
his house was robbed

04:50.991 --> 04:52.891
By this woman.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.030
What is this about?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.732
This man claims

05:00.734 --> 05:03.035
That this woman
broke into his house

05:03.037 --> 05:05.070
And stole several
items of value.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.905
Man:
Search her house and you'll
find 'em, I'll warrant.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.907
Two pewter mugs and
a fine-looking glass.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.909
Handed down from
me mother, they was.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.412
Probably stole 'em
to help with that baby she got

05:13.414 --> 05:14.813
With no husband.
That's a lie.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.049
Man: Ask her why she won't let
me look in her house, then.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.584
It's a lie, that's why.
They just want...

05:23.756 --> 05:25.424
Lord hugo:
Yes?

05:25.426 --> 05:28.660
What is it that
<i>they</i> want, young lady?

05:32.065 --> 05:33.799
Does bash know this girl?

05:33.801 --> 05:34.900
Nothing.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.739
My lord regent...

05:42.475 --> 05:44.509
...Shall I have the castle guard
search this woman's house?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.778
Of course.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.915
Have her held in the castle
until her house can be searched.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.086
Who's next?

05:54.088 --> 05:55.787
(crowd murmuring)

05:55.789 --> 05:57.356
Woman:
My lord regent,

05:57.358 --> 05:58.924
I just came to say

05:58.926 --> 06:01.393
It's an honor
to see you, sir.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.595
We hear talk of
this handsome bastard

06:03.597 --> 06:05.997
Who's ruling while
king henry's away.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.967
Begging pardon,
no offense.
None taken.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.937
If I might offer a blessing
just to wish you well.
That's far enough.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.039
For the lord demands
the bastard's removal.
I said, that's far enough.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.774
(woman gasping)

06:15.776 --> 06:17.376
(crowd excitedly chattering)

06:21.814 --> 06:23.915
This was meant for the regent.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.451
It was an attempt
on his life. Come here.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.954
Take this criminal
to the jails.
Woman: The bastard must die!

06:28.956 --> 06:30.989
Lola: You think lord hugo
had a hand in this?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.891
Why, he wouldn't dare without
the queen behind him.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.926
I want this room clear!
Good luck proving it.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.497
The cat's paw will be dead
before she gets to the jails.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.000
(indistinct chattering)

06:44.937 --> 06:45.971
Oh!

06:45.973 --> 06:47.973
Hello, mary.

06:47.975 --> 06:51.042
I was told that
no one should be allowed

06:51.044 --> 06:53.044
To enter these chambers,
except for guards

06:53.046 --> 06:55.914
And maidservants,
as per the king's orders.

06:55.916 --> 07:00.619
To include dressers,
footmen, cooks,

07:00.621 --> 07:01.853
And decorators.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.155
And maybe some
privy councilmen?

07:03.157 --> 07:04.890
Yes, your grace.
But the queen...

07:04.892 --> 07:06.925
Mary: Is terrifying,
yes, I understand.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.862
But you need to remember that
the king is also terrifying,

07:10.864 --> 07:12.497
And he will be home soon.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.999
Catherine:
Oh, mary, stop harassing him.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.568
I'm still locked in a tower,
am I not?

07:17.904 --> 07:20.038
Someone just
tried to kill bash.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.775
Well, is sebastian
all right?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.677
I said, <i>tried...</i> To kill him.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.579
Well, is he... Injured?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.914
How did this happen?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.185
Ah, were you hoping
I'd let something slip?

07:33.187 --> 07:36.021
Some clue that confirmed
I had something to do with this?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.056
Well, is there anyone
in the kingdom

07:38.058 --> 07:39.991
Who wants bash dead
more than you?

07:39.993 --> 07:42.727
Any nobleman,
I'd say, for starters.

07:42.729 --> 07:46.765
Anyone who loves France enough
to wish it a proper king.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.968
Didn't henry say that if
anything happened to bash,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.937
He'd have your head?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.206
Mm. Even henry can't execute
a queen without trial.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.975
And trials demand evidence.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.111
Are you really surprised
that I'd oppose sebastian?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.481
Would you do any differently

08:02.483 --> 08:03.949
If your children were robbed
of their birthright?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.984
But you know why
I can't marry francis.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.487
(sighs)
I'm doing this
to save his life.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.988
Even he understands that.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.989
Which is why he left.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.492
Giving up the throne.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.659
What you're up to

08:14.661 --> 08:16.027
Has nothing to do with my son.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.563
It's a plot that you
hatched with my husband

08:18.565 --> 08:20.065
To take over England,

08:20.067 --> 08:22.100
So the two of you
could rule half of europe.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.972
Henry gave me no choice
and my mother insisted.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.040
(scoffs) that doesn't mean
I can allow it.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.543
So you're going to continue
with your attempts on bash?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.944
Mary, sweet mary,

08:32.946 --> 08:35.714
I don't <i>attempt</i>
<i>to do anything, I do it.</i>

08:39.118 --> 08:40.585
I think not.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.687
(mary claps)

08:42.689 --> 08:43.922
I want everything
in this room removed.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.824
Every stick of furniture,

08:45.826 --> 08:47.526
Every rug, every tapestry,

08:47.528 --> 08:48.894
And every crumb of food.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.228
(gasps)
out!

08:51.998 --> 08:53.665
Not that!

08:53.667 --> 08:55.600
That's my eye cream.

08:55.602 --> 08:56.801
Be careful.
Could be poisoned.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.070
You, from now on,

08:59.072 --> 09:01.773
No servant is to enter
or exit, except by my leave,

09:01.775 --> 09:03.308
Or the leave of
one of my ladies.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.577
Violators will face
the headsman.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.048
Well, everything
out of here! Now!

09:17.156 --> 09:20.659
Bash, I just visited
catherine in the tower.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.861
I'm sure she's the one behind
the attempt on your life

09:22.863 --> 09:24.763
But I can't prove any...
I think I can.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.999
I got this from the blade
intended for him.

09:29.602 --> 09:33.071
There's only one thing'll
make a wound do that.
Poison.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.774
Alec, are you all right?
I've felt better.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.176
But I might manage
if this poultice works.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.714
That's why catherine asked
if you'd been injured.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.016
She knew you just needed
to be scratched by the knife

09:45.018 --> 09:46.351
For her plan to work.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.086
Yes, but that's not
why we're here, mary.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.257
Isabel?

09:56.162 --> 09:58.129
Your grace.
What is <i>she</i> doing here?

10:01.067 --> 10:03.034
Catherine's been busy.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.203
Either she knew her attempt
on my life might fail,

10:05.205 --> 10:06.771
Or she wanted to
condemn my memory.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.008
I don't understand.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.011
There's a reason this girl
was accused of thievery.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.046
They wanted her house
to be searched.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.114
For what reason?

10:16.116 --> 10:18.183
Isabel's father
was a traitor.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.185
Tried and beheaded
for his crimes.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.189
A traitor.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.891
They knew that if
they searched her house

10:26.893 --> 10:28.326
They'd find proof of
her kinship to him

10:28.328 --> 10:30.362
And they knew what
that might mean to me.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.034
Sebastian, if this girl is
pregnant with your child...

10:36.036 --> 10:37.068
The child
is not mine.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.004
Catherine thinks so,
I'm sure,

10:39.006 --> 10:40.772
But... On that much,
she's wrong.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.207
On that much?

10:42.209 --> 10:45.310
Isabel's father was
my mother's half-brother.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.880
No one knows of our true
connection, not yet,

10:48.882 --> 10:50.115
But if they learn...

10:50.117 --> 10:52.784
That a traitor
was my uncle...

10:52.786 --> 10:54.319
You could never be king.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.663
Bash:
Alec bribed a guard
to release isabel,

11:04.665 --> 11:05.930
And since she's only
a thief to the jailers,

11:05.932 --> 11:07.132
They thought nothing of it.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.133
But breaking her
out of the jails--

11:08.135 --> 11:09.768
Are you sure this is wise?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.936
Of course it isn't wise.
But what choice did I have?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.439
They're already headed
to "find" the supposed

11:14.441 --> 11:17.308
Proof that will tie her
to her father's treason.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.878
Once they have it,
they'll torture her,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.279
Make her confess
her ties to me.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.814
Her true ties,

11:22.816 --> 11:24.182
Which is even worse
than what they believe.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.217
And what do
they believe?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.285
Likely the same thing
you thought.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.953
That you
were lovers.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.255
Were you two seen together?
They must've,

11:30.257 --> 11:32.123
When I visited her
in the village.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.225
There must be some way
to fight this.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.794
You are the regent.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.129
The regent
they're working so hard

11:38.131 --> 11:39.964
To tie to a traitor's daughter.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.466
Why do you
think hugo

11:41.468 --> 11:42.967
Brought her before me?

11:42.969 --> 11:44.269
He wanted to see my reaction.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.204
He wanted the whole court

11:46.206 --> 11:47.839
To see my reaction.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.842
I can't intercede
for her, mary.

11:50.844 --> 11:53.078
I can't show any interest
in her case at all.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.446
(sighs)

11:54.448 --> 11:55.880
I'm taking her someplace safe

11:55.882 --> 11:57.148
And I'm taking her now.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.183
It's her only chance.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.852
But where
is safe?

12:00.854 --> 12:02.754
I've sent word to my
other cousins in bernay.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.189
They're going
to meet us
and hide her

12:04.191 --> 12:05.423
Until they can
get her to paris.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.126
Then she can stay
at my mother's.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.996
All right.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.364
But she can't leave the
castle looking the same

12:13.366 --> 12:15.433
Way she did when
she came in, can she?

12:21.006 --> 12:22.273
It's all right, isabel.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.742
We do this daily for mary.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.243
It's, um...
It's not that,

12:25.245 --> 12:26.277
It's just these
clothes...

12:26.279 --> 12:29.080
Are they too
warm for you?

12:29.082 --> 12:31.216
No, I'm-I'm just tired

12:31.218 --> 12:34.085
And my belly hurts
from moving around so much.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.857
When is her baby due?

12:38.859 --> 12:41.359
The midwives say she has
a month or so left.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.294
The midwife is wrong.
The baby is going to come soon.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.296
How do you know?
I watched
the nuns

12:45.298 --> 12:46.998
Bring a lot of babies
into the world.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.800
Then I'll take her
straight to a midwife.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.034
Well, you know
you can't do that.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.836
The midwives are all
in the village,

12:51.838 --> 12:53.371
That's the first place
that hugo will look.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.006
If you let them

12:55.008 --> 12:56.274
Catch you together, you're lost.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.509
Well, we can't stay here.

12:57.511 --> 12:58.943
No, you have
to leave.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.278
And take me with you.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.214
Mary... No.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.415
Bash, this is my fault.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.518
If I hadn't pressed you
to take the throne,

13:06.520 --> 13:07.952
You wouldn't
have this target

13:07.954 --> 13:09.053
On your back, and
neither would isabel.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.288
This is my
risk to take,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.356
For my family.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.524
She's a girl who could

13:12.526 --> 13:13.958
Give birth at any moment,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.527
While your bodyguard
could collapse

13:15.529 --> 13:17.095
From his wounds just as soon.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.430
You are not
equipped

13:19.432 --> 13:20.932
To deal with this alone.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.567
Mary, are you sure?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.369
Think:

13:24.371 --> 13:26.571
This the only way to keep
bash's hands clean of this.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.107
If I leave
in a carriage

13:29.109 --> 13:30.508
With isabel, bash can ride

13:30.510 --> 13:33.077
In a different direction
and meet us later.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.246
No one will know that he
and isabel left together.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.915
Catherine
and hugo

13:36.917 --> 13:38.082
Can think what they want,

13:38.084 --> 13:39.150
But they'll have no witnesses.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.088
How does she look?

13:44.090 --> 13:47.091
Like some awful baroness.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.426
I'm no worse than you,

13:48.428 --> 13:49.994
You gussied-up fop
of a future king.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.296
Mary:
I think

13:51.298 --> 13:53.565
You look perfect.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.166
Take her through
the passageways.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.101
The path to the stables
is still marked.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.103
Please.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.006
Every moment we wait,
she is more at risk.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.384
The hardest job,
really, is yours.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.386
I'm leaving you
in charge of catherine.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.222
In charge of her?
How?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.923
She needs to
remain cut off.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.492
With no messages
to go to or from her.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.428
And we need to find
something, anything,

14:23.430 --> 14:25.330
That ties her to these
plots against bash.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.298
The only thing
she fears is threat

14:27.300 --> 14:28.933
Of exposure
to henry.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.268
Can you do
that for me?

14:30.270 --> 14:32.370
We'll try.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.872
Be careful.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.074
She's dangerous.
Oh, really?
We hadn't noticed.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.376
You're the one that
needs to be careful.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.544
And quick.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.479
Now go.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.914
Catherine:
<i>Servant!</i>

14:42.916 --> 14:44.182
(pounding on door)

14:44.184 --> 14:46.451
(echoes):
Where are my servants?!

14:46.453 --> 14:47.952
I am hungry,

14:47.954 --> 14:50.922
I have a chamber pot
to be emptied,

14:50.924 --> 14:53.224
And the longer
I am made to wait,

14:53.226 --> 14:54.325
The more creative I will become

14:54.327 --> 14:56.461
In my retribution!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.600
Be quiet.
Do you want

15:02.602 --> 15:04.202
The whole castle to know
your humiliation?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.336
If you want to rule again,

15:05.338 --> 15:06.437
You'll need
the castle's respect.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.439
<i>If</i> I want to rule again,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.575
I will need you
to stop bungling.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.510
How did the bastard
not die from that poison?

15:12.512 --> 15:14.145
His mother sent him a bodyguard.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.514
Well, how have we
not bought that man?

15:16.516 --> 15:18.216
He's only just arrived.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.584
And the price of new
friends has gone up

15:19.586 --> 15:21.319
Since mary reminded
the guards to fear henry.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.620
It was awfully expensive

15:22.622 --> 15:24.455
To buy my way in here this time.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.457
It will be worth
the investment,
I promise you.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.992
You're sure?

15:27.994 --> 15:30.328
I'm beginning to
fear henry myself.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.397
Only a fool
would fear henry

15:32.399 --> 15:33.464
More than
that bastard.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.067
Do I have to remind
you, lord hugo,

15:36.069 --> 15:38.503
What happens to your lands,
your title, your power,

15:38.505 --> 15:39.637
Once henry
has changed

15:39.639 --> 15:41.539
The rules of succession?

15:41.541 --> 15:44.342
I am with you, my queen,

15:44.344 --> 15:46.177
So long as I have your
protection from henry.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.412
Well...

15:47.414 --> 15:49.547
With the
bastard gone,

15:49.549 --> 15:51.416
Henry will have to
keep the line intact.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.717
And you will be safe,

15:52.719 --> 15:56.487
And every future king
will be in your debt.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.623
Is that good enough for you?

16:02.261 --> 16:03.995
Has sebastian tried to escape

16:03.997 --> 16:05.496
With the
girl yet?

16:05.498 --> 16:08.333
They should try to make
their escape soon.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.435
Well, they have to be found
together, both dead,

16:10.437 --> 16:12.470
So their bodies
can tell the tale.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.505
The king's half-wit bastard

16:14.507 --> 16:16.741
And his secret whore,

16:16.743 --> 16:18.343
The traitor's
daughter,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.244
Set upon
by thieves.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.313
You do understand,
don't you?

16:22.315 --> 16:25.450
They will be followed
at a safe distance

16:25.452 --> 16:27.318
Until it is night.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.454
And then it
will be done.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.322
Properly, this time.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.590
Very good.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.359
Oh. Next time you come,

16:34.361 --> 16:36.561
Can you please bring me
some proper food?

16:36.563 --> 16:39.330
All mary's left me is
this hideously stale bread

16:39.332 --> 16:40.665
And I'm famished.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.470
The next time I come,

16:45.472 --> 16:47.238
I'll bring you a crown.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.582
(horse whinnies)

17:09.561 --> 17:11.462
Bash was right--
the villager with

17:11.464 --> 17:13.097
The poisoned knife
is gone, and the jailer

17:13.099 --> 17:14.365
Has no idea
where she went.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.666
Into the lake,
no doubt,

17:15.668 --> 17:17.368
With rocks in
her pockets.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.536
Greer?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.538
Queen's guards
were seen riding out

17:20.540 --> 17:22.340
In the same direction
that mary went.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.212
Don't they know plotting
against the king's son

17:28.214 --> 17:29.447
Will get
them killed?

17:29.449 --> 17:31.115
Henry won't
stand for it.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.383
Well, that's why
the queen's

17:32.385 --> 17:33.551
In the middle
of it.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.787
She must be promising
them her protection.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.588
But mary asked us
to find evidence.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.790
What if the queen
hasn't left any?

17:38.792 --> 17:42.527
Then we at least
have to slow her down.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.529
Bash:
Let's let the horses
rest for a spell.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.731
I'm going to check the roads,
see if the castle guards

17:46.733 --> 17:48.533
Are still back
behind us.
I'll come with you.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.468
Two sets of eyes
are better than one.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.337
Bash:
Alec...

17:53.339 --> 17:54.672
Stay here with my cousin.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.174
I'm not going anywhere.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.742
Need to find herbs
to refresh this poultice.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.679
Will you be offended
if I take all this off?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.481
It makes me feel...
Bash:
Trapped?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.716
I know the feeling.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.587
I'll help you get out
of it when we get back.

18:10.556 --> 18:11.823
How can you
have an uncle

18:11.825 --> 18:13.524
That no one
knows about?

18:13.526 --> 18:16.327
I'm not the first bastard
to bless my family.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.529
My mother's father
had a bastard son, too.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.831
His name was
jonathan durand.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.532
Isabel's father.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.567
I never knew him.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.835
Our families
weren't close.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.570
When he was
executed,

18:25.572 --> 18:26.671
Isabel came to live
with my family, secretly.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.106
And how did
the queen

18:28.108 --> 18:29.607
Find out about the connection?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.175
No doubt one of her spies

18:31.177 --> 18:32.410
Saw me visiting her.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.345
Were you taking
her money?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.713
And food.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.615
And a lot of
unwanted advice.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.450
She was supposed to marry
the baby's father,

18:39.452 --> 18:40.685
But he passed away
in a border skirmish

18:40.687 --> 18:42.120
A few months ago.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.721
You're like a big
brother to her.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.189
A proper
big brother

18:45.191 --> 18:46.691
Wouldn't have gotten
her into this mess.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.693
You didn't get her
into this mess, I did.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.128
Mary...

18:50.130 --> 18:51.562
Stop blaming yourself.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.898
I would like to,
but when you say

18:53.900 --> 18:55.733
That you feel trapped,
I can't help but wonder...

18:55.735 --> 18:57.535
But I don't feel
trapped by you.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.237
I feel trapped
by the politics,

18:59.239 --> 19:01.305
The rules,
the formalities.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.674
(sighs)
what I feel about you is...

19:03.676 --> 19:06.177
You don't have to explain.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.713
Our engagement happened so fast,

19:08.715 --> 19:09.814
We haven't had time to...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.682
(horses whinnying, men shouting)

19:11.684 --> 19:13.851
Mary:
Here come the guards.
Let's go. If those are

19:13.853 --> 19:15.586
The queen's men,
they've already tried
to kill you once.

19:15.588 --> 19:18.322
They won't worry about bringing
you back alive, or isabel.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.757
There's a fork
in the road just ahead.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.492
The one they expect us
to take is shorter,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.694
It skirts around the forest.
But the other one...

19:23.696 --> 19:26.731
A road they wouldn't
want to follow.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.635
Is this really necessary?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.869
The regent
ordered you

19:31.871 --> 19:33.704
Not to pass messages
inside the castle.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.705
You defied
his order.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.541
Catherine:
I see.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.242
So the three of you have come

19:38.244 --> 19:39.844
To buck each other up,
because I'm so frightening?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.946
Or did you all
just want the pleasure

19:41.948 --> 19:43.748
Of seeing me brought so low?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.816
I suppose a little
bit of each, actually.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.954
(chuckles)

19:49.956 --> 19:52.490
I guess you're a bit starved
for entertainment, kenna,

19:52.492 --> 19:54.825
Now that the king's
rejected you.

19:54.827 --> 19:58.329
You're so beautiful,
I marvel to think

19:58.331 --> 20:00.665
At how grating and
tedious you must also be

20:00.667 --> 20:02.400
To achieve such a thing.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.735
Leave her alone.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.971
Greer of kinross.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.406
Oh, you're so plucky

20:08.408 --> 20:10.741
And brave
and ripe and ready.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.710
Coming to court to sell
yourself to a noble

20:12.712 --> 20:14.712
In order to salvage
your father's failures.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.847
I hope your flesh
isn't too weak

20:16.849 --> 20:18.416
To safeguard your virtue,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.284
As it's all
your family has left.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.453
You can stop
bullying everyone now.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.822
The reason we came here
is to tell you we're the only

20:24.824 --> 20:26.791
Three faces you'll be seeing
for a while.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.426
No more guards,
no more servants,

20:28.428 --> 20:31.529
No one else you can threaten
or bribe.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.631
So you're the strong one.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.433
Are you also the smart one,
lola?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.435
If so, you'd know

20:37.437 --> 20:39.870
You've already let
your queen down.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.374
You three coming here tells me
she's not in the castle.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.476
Otherwise, she'd have
delivered this message.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.312
It also tells me she's
probably off helping
that bastard

20:48.314 --> 20:49.614
And his escaped lover.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.617
And you saying so
tells us mary was right.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.652
You've had a hand in every
plot against bash,

20:54.654 --> 20:59.657
And if you've left a scrap
of evidence, we'll find it.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.536
Run, little girls, run away.

21:13.505 --> 21:15.539
(cawing)

21:16.475 --> 21:17.842
Mary:
Her water's broken.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.010
My baby's coming.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.646
And soon.
How soon?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.848
The labor can take minutes
or it can take hours.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.683
Either way, we won't
be getting out

21:25.685 --> 21:27.585
Of the blood woods
before it's dark.

21:29.521 --> 21:30.721
We can't go back.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.590
The queen's guards
will catch us.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.358
And even if we could
turn back,

21:34.360 --> 21:36.027
She can't give birth
in a moving carriage.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.796
Both she
and the baby could die.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.365
Here, at least
she has a chance.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.800
There's a tent
in the carriage.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.402
We'll have no fire,

21:44.404 --> 21:45.703
And the moment
this baby is born,

21:45.705 --> 21:47.972
We get back on the
road, day or night.

22:02.454 --> 22:05.456
(horses snoring,
distant animals calling)

22:05.458 --> 22:07.858
My muscles hurt so much,
I can barely move.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.794
Have you had
anything to drink?

22:09.796 --> 22:12.596
Some milk yesterday morning.
Why?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.098
I've seen this before.
And the muscles clench

22:14.100 --> 22:15.466
Without enough water,

22:15.468 --> 22:16.834
And it might have brought

22:16.836 --> 22:17.935
Your birthing pains on early.
Bash?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.670
There's a stream
just north of here.

22:19.672 --> 22:23.607
Alec's outside.
I won't be long.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.944
You must think
very little of me.

22:26.946 --> 22:30.981
Pregnant, with no husband,
no job, no way to feed a family.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.817
Not at all.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.720
Bash told me you lost
the baby's father. I'm sorry.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.688
You're awfully kind.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.790
I can't quite believe it.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.525
That I'd be kind?

22:41.527 --> 22:44.362
That I have a queen wiping
sweat off my brow, like, I was

22:44.364 --> 22:45.629
The queen, not you.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.398
Do you really think royals
are so different

22:47.400 --> 22:48.632
From ordinary people?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.501
Well, just look at you.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.969
What about bash?

22:51.971 --> 22:54.472
He could be king
someday soon.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.873
And married to you, I hear.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.842
Is that so hard to imagine?

22:57.844 --> 23:00.010
The married bit, no.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.946
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.648
The king bit, though...

23:06.051 --> 23:08.886
You can't imagine
your cousin as a king?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.921
Don't kings have to make
awful decisions sometimes?

23:10.923 --> 23:13.557
Betray their friends for
the good of their country?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.393
Don't they have to be nice
to people

23:15.395 --> 23:16.927
They'd much rather hit
with a shovel?

23:16.929 --> 23:18.596
Sometimes, yes. (chuckles)

23:18.598 --> 23:22.500
Then, no, I can't recommend him.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.069
(groans)

23:25.071 --> 23:26.570
The pains are starting

23:26.572 --> 23:29.807
To come in faster now.
It's almost time.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.913
(sighs)

23:37.482 --> 23:41.519
Lovely kenna, as long
as we're stuck here together,

23:41.521 --> 23:43.454
You on guard duty,
me under guard,

23:43.456 --> 23:46.090
Let's speak frankly, shall we?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.592
My advice,
if you want it,

23:48.594 --> 23:51.495
Is to leave mary's service
as soon as she leaves France,

23:51.497 --> 23:54.498
And go someplace far away
from politics.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.835
You're not smart enough
to survive at court.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.538
But you are pretty enough
to land a good husband

24:00.540 --> 24:03.040
And to lead a nice quiet life.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.842
You're awfully confident.

24:04.844 --> 24:10.614
Sebastian is already captured by
now with the traitor's daughter,

24:10.616 --> 24:12.950
Or else if he's
foolish enough,

24:12.952 --> 24:14.552
He's gone into the blood wood.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.587
Either way, my problems
are soon to be solved.

24:16.589 --> 24:17.988
Are you sure
you want

24:17.990 --> 24:21.625
To be sharing one of your plots
with me?
Do you think

24:21.627 --> 24:24.462
I care what the king's former
bed thing chooses to gossip?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.764
Spoken words
aren't evidence.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.900
They vanish like smoke in the
wind as soon as they're spoken.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.069
Surely, all the
king's promises

24:32.071 --> 24:34.038
Taught you that.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.940
You're so very right.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.509
Thank you.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.945
Where are you going?

24:40.947 --> 24:42.880
I'm not done abusing you.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.882
You're taking away
my only amusement!

24:47.953 --> 24:48.986
(moans)

24:50.956 --> 24:53.824
We need more water.
I'll be right back.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.059
Mary, no, you mustn't!

24:55.061 --> 24:57.628
(gasping)

25:01.900 --> 25:03.100
(branches crackling,
isabel breathing heavily)

25:03.102 --> 25:04.702
(horse snorts)

25:15.881 --> 25:17.748
(gasps)

25:25.090 --> 25:27.191
(horse whinnies)

25:27.193 --> 25:29.159
(grunting)

25:30.128 --> 25:32.763
(branches crackling,
horse snorts softly)

25:35.700 --> 25:37.601
(horse whinnies)

25:37.603 --> 25:38.769
They're here!

25:38.771 --> 25:40.137
I saw their lights
in the woods,

25:40.139 --> 25:41.839
And they've set up
their symbols outside.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.041
Bash, look.
It's the same as the one

25:44.043 --> 25:46.977
They used to mark me for
sacrifice. Those hideous pagans.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.079
Hideous pagans?
You mean the blood cult?

25:49.081 --> 25:50.180
What difference
does it make?

25:50.182 --> 25:52.049
They're bloodthirsty heretics.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.617
Not every pagan is bloodthirsty.

25:53.619 --> 25:54.685
Bash:
That's enough.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.086
If they are outside...

25:56.088 --> 25:57.321
They tried to mark us for death.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.089
They put their symbols up
outside the tent,

25:59.091 --> 26:00.257
But I tore them down.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.659
You did what?

26:03.662 --> 26:04.662
You don't understand.

26:04.664 --> 26:05.796
These pagans...

26:05.798 --> 26:08.632
Bash, tell them,
tell them what they...

26:08.634 --> 26:12.336
(branches crackling nearby,
horses snorting)

26:12.338 --> 26:14.238
(horse whinnies)

26:14.773 --> 26:16.674
(horse whinnies)

26:16.676 --> 26:19.343
(men speaking indistinctly)

26:19.345 --> 26:20.644
(gasps)

26:20.646 --> 26:22.947
(horse whinnies)

26:26.651 --> 26:28.185
(gasps)

26:28.187 --> 26:30.120
<i>Bilkemen.</i>

26:30.122 --> 26:31.255
<i>Unay.</i>

26:31.257 --> 26:33.190
<i>Ari-aye mondana.</i>

26:33.192 --> 26:35.125
Bash, isabel and alec:
<i>Bilkemen. Unay.</i>

26:35.127 --> 26:37.261
<i>Ari-aye mondana.</i>

26:37.263 --> 26:40.831
<i>Bilkemen. Unay.</i>
<i>Ari-aye mondana.</i>

26:40.833 --> 26:44.201
<i>Bilkemen.</i>
<i>Unay. Ari-aye mondana.</i>

26:44.203 --> 26:47.371
<i>Bilkemen. Unay.</i>
<i>Ari-aye mondana!</i>

26:47.373 --> 26:49.607
(horse whinnies, blade rings)
(mary gasps)

27:04.055 --> 27:05.656
Bash:
They slaughtered
one of the horses.

27:05.658 --> 27:10.260
We're safe?
You think after what
just happened we're safe?

27:10.262 --> 27:12.096
They would have
slaughtered all of us,

27:12.098 --> 27:13.297
But they heard our prayers,

27:13.299 --> 27:15.065
And they chose one
of the horses instead.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.668
They spared us because they
thought we we're pagans,

27:17.670 --> 27:20.671
Because you are pagans,
all of you.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.240
That's what you've been
hiding from me.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.242
You're a heretic!

27:25.244 --> 27:27.344
What I am is alive...
And so are you.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.148
Mary. Mary,
wait, please.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.217
Listen to me.
You're the one

27:33.219 --> 27:35.753
Who hung the medallion
on the tent, aren't you?

27:35.755 --> 27:38.122
You put this horrid symbol
up, so they would kill
something else,

27:38.124 --> 27:39.390
Because we were one of them!

27:39.392 --> 27:41.225
You don't understand.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.093
This is why you didn't want me
to help with isabel.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.795
This is why your uncle
was put to death!

27:44.797 --> 27:47.131
He was a pagan,
a heretic, wasn't he?

27:47.133 --> 27:49.099
Mary, calm down before you say
something you don't mean.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.802
You lied to me!
You hid this horrible shame!

27:51.804 --> 27:53.137
What shame is that, exactly?

27:53.139 --> 27:58.342
The monsters...
Who killed this animal.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.111
Who sacrifice people
and revel in their blood!

28:02.981 --> 28:04.682
Well, why aren't you saying
anything?!

28:04.684 --> 28:06.316
Why would I respond
to such ignorant cruelty?

28:06.318 --> 28:09.219
The pagan is calling
the catholic ignorant?

28:09.221 --> 28:10.788
To begin with,
I'm not pagan, mary.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.856
I'm catholic, same as you,
same as my mother.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.892
Those were pagan prayers!
You told me that!

28:14.894 --> 28:16.060
They're just words.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.728
I'm not even sure
what they mean.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.329
I learned them
as a small child

28:19.331 --> 28:23.901
I heard them repeated,
the way a child

28:23.903 --> 28:26.203
Hears the lord's prayer,
so I know them by heart now.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.806
And isabel? And alec?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.108
They are believers.

28:32.177 --> 28:33.944
Isabel learned
the faith from her father.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.380
And she clung to it even more
tightly when he was beheaded

28:36.382 --> 28:37.815
For defending it.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.249
The same way
anyone would.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.118
The same way thousands
of christians did,

28:41.120 --> 28:43.253
When their families
were martyred.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.755
(isabel gasps)

28:44.757 --> 28:46.356
Most pagans are
just like us, mary.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.925
They live
and they pray

28:47.927 --> 28:50.227
And they struggle
exactly as we do.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.162
They just
happen to see

28:52.164 --> 28:54.264
Something different
when they picture god.

28:54.266 --> 28:57.334
And what of the monsters
who slaughtered this horse?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.802
Those devils come
from a branch

28:58.804 --> 29:00.471
Of the faith,
some violent sect

29:00.473 --> 29:02.272
That makes no sense to me...

29:02.274 --> 29:04.308
Or alec or isabel.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.009
What is this sect?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.479
All I know is they worship
a deity I've never heard of.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.381
They believe that
they're serving some thing,

29:11.383 --> 29:14.318
A beast in these woods
that craves human blood.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.252
(isabel gasps)

29:15.254 --> 29:16.987
The baby!
Come quick!

29:16.989 --> 29:18.388
(isabel screams)

29:20.358 --> 29:22.259
Come on, isabel.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.327
Just one more,
one more.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.329
Just push, push.
(shrieks)

29:25.331 --> 29:26.897
It's all right.
It's almost here.

29:26.899 --> 29:30.000
Come on. One more time.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.935
(screams)
good girl. Uh!

29:33.404 --> 29:36.173
(crying)

29:36.175 --> 29:37.274
Oh!

29:40.211 --> 29:42.312
(crying)

29:43.515 --> 29:45.482
(isabel sobs softly)

29:49.254 --> 29:50.888
Is he all right?

29:50.890 --> 29:53.423
It's a she!

29:55.226 --> 29:57.361
She's more than all right.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.796
(crying)

29:58.798 --> 30:00.364
She's beautiful.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.833
♪ got a lot to do

30:04.068 --> 30:05.369
♪ I've got a lot to do

30:05.371 --> 30:09.339
♪ oh-oh, but that can wait

30:11.409 --> 30:16.046
♪ I've got a lot to prove
to nobody ♪

30:16.048 --> 30:19.550
♪ I've got a lot to prove

30:19.552 --> 30:22.119
♪ I've got
a lot to prove ♪

30:22.121 --> 30:26.857
♪ oh-oh, but that can wait.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.132
Lola,

30:35.134 --> 30:36.533
You're back.

30:36.535 --> 30:40.437
Apparently, last time
I wasn't unpleasant enough.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.072
I just came to say thank you.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.273
For what?

30:43.275 --> 30:45.409
I thought having kenna
outside your door

30:45.411 --> 30:46.610
Might provoke you, and it did.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.413
You boasted that spoken words

30:49.415 --> 30:51.849
Were like smoke in the wind,
useless as evidence,

30:51.851 --> 30:54.351
And that gave kenna
a brilliant idea.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.553
Kenna?
A brilliant idea?

30:56.555 --> 30:59.256
The evidence we needed against
you was written words.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.261
You must recognize
your own seal.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.363
I do, but I don't
recognize these letters.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.632
This one contains
your instructions

31:08.634 --> 31:11.535
To hire a villager
to attack bash with
a poisoned knife.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.170
You are holding
one of greer's

31:13.172 --> 31:15.372
Practice letters.
She does a good job

31:15.374 --> 31:17.441
With your hand,
don't you think?

31:17.443 --> 31:20.911
Why would I ever
put this on paper?

31:20.913 --> 31:22.579
It makes no sense.
Does it matter?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.581
We have this letter
and we have the knife.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.251
If those are enough
to make henry investigate,

31:27.253 --> 31:28.585
Can you trust that
none of your guards

31:28.587 --> 31:30.354
Will confess under torture?

31:31.356 --> 31:33.290
What do you think
henry will do

31:33.292 --> 31:35.092
When he learns you were working

31:35.094 --> 31:36.326
To undermine his favorite son?

31:36.328 --> 31:37.527
To sabotage

31:37.529 --> 31:40.364
His plans for England?

31:40.366 --> 31:42.132
Don't you want to know
what the second one says?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.234
Not particularly.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.037
Well, you should
thank us for this one.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.206
This one shows
that you are selfless,

31:49.208 --> 31:50.607
Kind and benevolent.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.443
You've ordered your
gold stores be used

31:53.445 --> 31:55.045
To pay for
a public banquet

31:55.047 --> 31:56.313
In honor of the
acting regent, bash.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.982
Wine, ale,
musicians

31:58.984 --> 32:00.250
And 50 roasted pigs.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.451
No expense to be spared.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.986
You... Huh.

32:02.988 --> 32:04.655
Lord hugo did look taken aback
when he read it,

32:04.657 --> 32:06.657
But he's already ordered
the preparations begun.

32:06.659 --> 32:08.325
This first letter...

32:08.327 --> 32:09.359
Who has seen this?

32:09.361 --> 32:10.627
Well, that's
up to you.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.530
If any harm comes
to mary or bash,

32:13.532 --> 32:16.233
Or any of us, henry
and francis will see it.

32:17.335 --> 32:18.402
If not...

32:21.539 --> 32:24.241
One of mary's ladies
turned out to be a spy,

32:24.243 --> 32:26.176
The other a forger.
And kenna...

32:26.178 --> 32:28.545
Well, let's be kind and
call her a seductress.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.247
What are you?

32:30.249 --> 32:32.349
A few months ago,

32:32.351 --> 32:34.051
You killed
a man I loved.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.686
Ah, colin.

32:35.688 --> 32:37.321
So, you're bitter, then.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.556
No, I'd say that title
falls to you.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.391
You justify what
you do to protect

32:41.393 --> 32:43.226
Your son, but where is he now?

32:43.228 --> 32:44.461
You've driven him away.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.198
You're bitter, and alone.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.334
I had my reasons.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.369
I don't care why
you abuse your power.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.005
I just want it
taken away from you.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.406
Forever.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.411
(door slams shut)

33:04.282 --> 33:05.649
If we ride
out soon,

33:05.651 --> 33:08.118
We can be home from
the rendezvous by nightfall.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.721
Bash, I wanted to apologize.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.255
Last night

33:12.257 --> 33:13.991
I said some things that...
You were scared.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.325
We all were.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.593
Forget it.

33:16.595 --> 33:19.596
I can't forget it.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.264
And really,
neither can you.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.499
What do you mean?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.001
When your father
gets home,

33:24.003 --> 33:25.602
If the pope agrees to his terms

33:25.604 --> 33:28.038
And makes you the next heir,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.007
Things are going
to start moving very quickly.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.476
Henry will want us
married immediately.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.012
And the moment you say yes,

33:35.014 --> 33:36.546
The moment we are married,

33:36.548 --> 33:38.482
You will be
the king of scotland,

33:38.484 --> 33:41.184
And not long after that,
the king of France.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.619
You will have
hundreds

33:42.621 --> 33:43.754
More enemies,

33:43.756 --> 33:45.622
Far more than you have now.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.791
People endlessly
seeking your
vulnerabilities.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.359
My family's secrets, you mean.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.128
I mean
your family's

33:51.130 --> 33:53.497
Importance to you.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.032
You would do
anything for them,

33:55.034 --> 33:57.134
In spite of
the risk

33:57.136 --> 33:59.569
To yourself, or to your crown,
and I see that now.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.371
And you think
that's irresponsible.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.373
I think it's noble.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.276
Which is why I think
you may not want this,

34:06.278 --> 34:08.678
In your heart.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.214
And I want you to have a choice.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.518
If you don't
want a crown...

34:14.520 --> 34:17.621
If you don't want to marry me,
I will understand.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.458
There's something
wrong with isabel.

34:22.326 --> 34:23.560
Please!

34:23.562 --> 34:25.662
Isabel... What's wrong?

34:25.664 --> 34:28.065
Look at me.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.699
Oh, no.

34:29.701 --> 34:33.103
What?
What is it?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.272
She's still
bleeding.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.506
And it
won't stop.

34:36.508 --> 34:37.808
(sighs)

34:37.810 --> 34:40.577
Bash, I've seen
this happen before.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.079
Then we'll get her out of here.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.347
Find someone who can help her.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.416
Bash...

34:48.319 --> 34:51.521
Promise you'll care
for the baby,

34:51.523 --> 34:53.690
The same way you
always cared for me.

34:53.692 --> 34:54.791
(baby cooing)

34:54.793 --> 34:56.259
Find her
a home

34:56.261 --> 34:58.462
And a family...

34:58.464 --> 34:59.663
Don't talk this way.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.298
You'll care for her yourself.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.300
Promise me.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.435
(baby fussing)

35:06.571 --> 35:07.838
I will.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.339
On my word.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.711
Isabel...

35:14.713 --> 35:15.745
(fusses)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.280
Bash:
Isabel.

35:18.649 --> 35:20.717
Isabel.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.354
(baby crying)

35:24.356 --> 35:26.189
(softly):
Isabel.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.262
(sighs)

35:39.770 --> 35:41.571
(owl hoots)

35:41.573 --> 35:44.608
You look so like your mother.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.909
If you have half her heart,

35:45.911 --> 35:48.278
You'll add plenty
of joy to this world.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.814
(baby fussing)

35:53.217 --> 35:54.784
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.386
Bash:
Please take this child
to the court nursery,

35:56.388 --> 35:57.420
But use discretion.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.623
Hide her existence

35:59.625 --> 36:01.758
Among the other children
you care for.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.627
I'm caring for two new ones

36:03.629 --> 36:05.662
And a duke's visiting niece.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.497
She'll fit right in.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.832
If anyone asks you
where the baby came from,

36:08.834 --> 36:10.300
You found her
at the castle door.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.535
That's all you know.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.602
Do you understand?
Of course.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.271
I'll say
nothing.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.809
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

36:21.579 --> 36:23.313
Did you see the baby's foot?

36:24.749 --> 36:26.516
It's a mark that
pagans sometimes put

36:26.518 --> 36:28.251
On their newborns,
to distinguish the baby

36:28.253 --> 36:29.753
In the eyes of their gods.

36:29.755 --> 36:32.255
Isabel must have
put it there.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.658
Who knows of this tradition?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.959
Any pagan would.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.394
Some villagers might.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.496
Will the mark fade?

36:39.498 --> 36:41.531
It should,
eventually.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.767
Well, let's pray that
eventually comes soon.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.837
(distant bells toll)

36:53.377 --> 36:55.278
We wondered where you had gone,
my lord regent,

36:55.280 --> 36:56.680
When you disappeared
so suddenly.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.215
Bash:
I went hunting,

36:58.217 --> 36:59.783
And I found this fugitive.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.785
I asked her why
she fled the jails, and she...

37:01.787 --> 37:03.420
Threatened me with a knife.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.322
I...

37:06.457 --> 37:08.792
The regent was forced
to kill her, my lord.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.661
She fought him, but he
made quick work of it.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.666
Well, it's no wonder
she threatened you.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.767
When we searched
this girl's home,

37:17.769 --> 37:19.269
We found not only
stolen property,

37:19.271 --> 37:20.704
But proof that her father

37:20.706 --> 37:21.938
Was jonathan durand,

37:21.940 --> 37:23.373
A well-known traitor.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.808
Never heard of him.

37:26.477 --> 37:28.778
Oh, he was part of
an uprising 15 years ago,

37:28.780 --> 37:29.980
After the crown burned

37:29.982 --> 37:31.915
Dozens of
heretics.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.818
He was suspected
of being a pagan himself.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.620
Well, whoever he was,

37:36.622 --> 37:38.655
Now his line is ended.
Is it?

37:38.657 --> 37:40.857
I seem to remember that
this girl was with child.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.760
This is the way
I found her.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.695
She must have
delivered her baby

37:45.697 --> 37:46.963
And left it
behind.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.398
We can only hope the wolves

37:48.400 --> 37:49.733
Ended the child's life quickly.

37:49.735 --> 37:50.800
Indeed.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.836
The unwanted child
of a criminal

37:52.838 --> 37:55.438
Deserves no better than
the unwanted criminal herself.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.878
Just as the cowardly plotter

38:01.880 --> 38:03.913
Deserves no better
than his hidden puppeteer.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.716
How is your friend, the queen?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.852
If she's too cold
and lonely in her cell,

38:08.854 --> 38:12.289
We can always find her
some company.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.642
No.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.943
Thank you, but

38:33.945 --> 38:35.612
Isabel's people
don't put

38:35.614 --> 38:36.980
Cut flowers on their graves.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.049
Flowers wither away,

38:39.051 --> 38:41.451
And adorn death with more death.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.354
But how are we to properly
mark her grave, then?

38:44.356 --> 38:47.057
I know that it must
have been so hard for you

38:47.059 --> 38:48.692
To present her body to court

38:48.694 --> 38:49.959
Like she was
some kind of criminal.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.028
(sighs)

38:53.597 --> 38:56.366
There is another tradition,
but...

38:56.368 --> 38:57.634
You won't like it.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.768
What is it?

38:58.770 --> 39:00.837
Please.

39:15.820 --> 39:18.855
We owe our bodies
and lives to the earth,

39:18.857 --> 39:21.691
So pagans give thanks

39:21.693 --> 39:23.560
With what is most vital to us.

39:23.562 --> 39:28.932
♪ and meet...

39:28.934 --> 39:32.402
♪ me there

39:32.404 --> 39:33.837
♪ bundles of flowers

39:33.839 --> 39:35.872
♪ we'll wait through the hours

39:35.874 --> 39:37.107
♪ of cold

39:37.109 --> 39:38.375

39:40.911 --> 39:46.616
♪ shelter...

39:46.618 --> 39:49.052
♪ as we go

39:49.054 --> 39:51.388
Mary...

39:52.857 --> 39:54.991
I've thought about
what you said.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.961
I never wanted
a crown,

39:57.963 --> 39:59.929
But if that's my fate,
I'll accept it.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.631
I'll learn
to wear it.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.701
But you need to know something:

40:05.803 --> 40:07.837
I'm not francis.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.740
My duty will never
be to some country,

40:10.742 --> 40:13.076
Some land, some throne.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.911
If I'm married
to you,

40:14.913 --> 40:16.880
You'll be my family.

40:16.882 --> 40:20.083
I'll be in it for you,
and only you.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.119
And if that's not what
proper kings do...

40:23.121 --> 40:24.888
♪ who am I

40:24.890 --> 40:26.990
♪ darling, to you

40:26.992 --> 40:28.625
♪ who am I

40:28.627 --> 40:31.094
♪ I come alone here

40:34.832 --> 40:37.767
♪ I come alone here...
