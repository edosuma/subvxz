00:25.893 --> 00:27.128
Whoa!

00:27.161 --> 00:28.428
Oh! We gotta stop this.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.064
If Gotham's destroyed
we gotta move

00:30.097 --> 00:33.000
and there's no way
I'm living' in Metropolis.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.167
So do your
plant control thingie

00:34.167 --> 00:35.703
and put an end to this.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.103
Yeah, you know what,

00:37.103 --> 00:38.506
you're really taking
the romance out of it

00:38.506 --> 00:40.140
when you just call it my
"plant control thingie."

00:40.140 --> 00:41.642
[balloon man screaming]

00:41.674 --> 00:43.878
Hey buddy. Stop.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.045
[balloon man whimpering]

-[roaring]
-Argh!

00:47.384 --> 00:50.283
[growls and roars]

00:50.317 --> 00:52.052
[nervously] I...
I can't control them.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.954
I've... They...
They've mutated!

00:53.987 --> 00:55.590
Maybe they'll respond
to heavy scolding?

00:55.622 --> 00:57.924
[yells] You are being
very disrespectful!

00:57.957 --> 00:59.527
-[growling]
-Run.

00:59.561 --> 01:02.712
[theme music playing]

01:06.867 --> 01:08.135
Look at that,

01:08.168 --> 01:10.471
Ivy has procured us
a tree army.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.938
She can't control
the plants.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.207
Yes, Harley. Hurrah!

01:14.242 --> 01:16.677
Uh, I don't think
those trees
are on our side.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.745
Run!

01:17.778 --> 01:19.680

01:23.483 --> 01:24.352
Argh!

01:24.352 --> 01:27.155
This is my favorite top. Dick!

[groans] Ow!

01:30.823 --> 01:32.093

Sweet Roosevelt's ghost!

01:33.894 --> 01:35.296

I'm healed, baby!

Ah. Easy come, easy go.

Oh, I am slain!

01:52.480 --> 01:54.915
If thou be merciful... [gasps]

01:54.948 --> 01:56.650
Open the tomb...

01:56.650 --> 01:58.618
And lay with...

01:58.652 --> 01:59.953
[weakly] Juliet.

01:59.986 --> 02:04.125
[groaning]

02:04.158 --> 02:06.727
[Harley gasps]

02:06.760 --> 02:07.894
[excitedly] And scene!

-[grunts]
-[Poison Ivy] Oh, my god!

02:09.163 --> 02:10.364
[Dr. Psycho]
That deserves a suicide.

[tree monsters growling]

02:12.165 --> 02:14.501
[people screaming in terror]

02:14.533 --> 02:15.603
Sweet Jesus,

02:15.603 --> 02:17.003
the park's filled
with murderous plants.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.606
[people screaming]

02:18.640 --> 02:20.508
Thank God
we canceled Jazz Fest.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.343
The way I see it,
there's only one option.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.711
[loudly] Bomb the damn place

02:24.711 --> 02:25.746
to kingdom come.

02:25.778 --> 02:26.913
Jim...

02:26.913 --> 02:28.048
there are
innocent people there.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.383
Well, it's not our fault

02:29.383 --> 02:30.383
if they don't check
their social and see

02:30.383 --> 02:31.752
Jazz Fest was canceled.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.052
You can't bomb the park.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.354
Of course we can.
We have tanks.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.657
The taxpayers paid for 'em.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.592
Yep, Jazz Fest
may have been canceled,

02:37.625 --> 02:40.328
but we can still give
the people a show, buddy.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.128
I need you to be surgical
about this, Jim.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.396
Be prudent.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.332
-I can't hold your hand--
-Why not?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.901
Because Scarecrow's
crop-dusting fear toxin

02:46.901 --> 02:48.870
around the perimeter of Gotham,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.872
forcing thousands
of innocent people
towards the park.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.875
-That potato sack
son of a bitch.
-I'll handle him.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.044
The Justice League
is en route to help us
with the tree problem.

02:56.044 --> 02:59.580
-I just need you
to evacuate the park.
-Got it.

02:59.614 --> 03:00.949
You know what would be
a good way

03:00.949 --> 03:01.949
to get the people
out of the park?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.317
No tanks.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.918
-[sirens wailing]

03:04.951 --> 03:08.288
-[thuds]
-[roaring]

03:08.322 --> 03:09.556
So, Commissioner Gordon,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.391
this situation seems dire.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.426
Are we finally
going to see those tanks

03:13.461 --> 03:14.697
our taxpayers voted on?

03:14.729 --> 03:16.330
No. That wouldn't be...

03:16.330 --> 03:17.330
[mockingly] prudent.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.266
Oh, boo. Why?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.534
To minimize loss of life

03:20.534 --> 03:22.302
because some jazz hippies

03:22.336 --> 03:24.104
can't read
a goddamn email!

03:24.138 --> 03:26.039
Well, in this
reporter's opinion

03:26.073 --> 03:27.074
it looks like we are--

03:27.108 --> 03:28.944
So fucked!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.487
Hey. Nice save,
Jerk-off League!

03:40.520 --> 03:44.570
That's not our name at all.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.965
[tree monsters groaning]

03:50.997 --> 03:55.069
[roaring]

03:55.103 --> 03:57.639
Ugh, how does she pull off
those clunky bracelets?

03:57.639 --> 03:59.173
I know, it's like annoying.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.540
Well, hey you know,
thanks for the help.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.175
Harley and crew
will handle the rest.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.679
Um... Hey!
Why am I tied up?

04:04.679 --> 04:06.413
Because you
and your troublesome horde

04:06.413 --> 04:08.186
are behind this anarchy.

04:08.186 --> 04:10.183
What? Bullshit!

04:10.217 --> 04:11.318
Harley Quinn,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.387
I declare you
and your allies,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.923
including that
elderly war criminal,

04:15.955 --> 04:17.492
to be banished to...

04:17.524 --> 04:18.826
[hesitantly]
You wanna say it

04:18.858 --> 04:19.994
since it's your thing?

04:20.026 --> 04:21.060
Thanks, Diana.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.564
[loudly] To the Phantom Zone!

04:22.598 --> 04:27.247
What? You gotta be shittin' me.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.204
[Sy] Uh-oh,
oh, I'm seeing' the light.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.538
Oh, my God!

04:31.572 --> 04:33.307
I didn't think
I'd make it to Heaven

04:33.341 --> 04:34.740
after what I did in...

04:34.740 --> 04:35.942
Uh... Eh, well,

04:35.975 --> 04:37.345
everywhere, I guess.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.446
Mostly Asia.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.812
We didn't do any of this.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.947
They're tree monsters.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.117
She controls the trees.

04:42.117 --> 04:43.718
So...

04:43.718 --> 04:45.452
[hesitantly] Uh...
You want to say it this time?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.288
Sure. You're all going...

04:47.288 --> 04:48.822
-[both choking]
-...to the Phantom Zone.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.000
Make me tell the truth.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.903
Poison Ivy,
did you do this?

05:02.935 --> 05:04.100
We didn't do it.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.399
We aren't responsible
for the tree monsters.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.007
I secretly watch NASCAR.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.600
I take long showers.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.310
I think paper straws
are stupid and get
too soggy.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.911
I was excited
for Jazz Fest.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.180
[moans painfully]

05:13.180 --> 05:16.317
Fine. I was very excited
for Jazz Fest.

Oh, God!

05:22.656 --> 05:23.925
Someone take this off me.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.394
If you're not
responsible for this,

05:26.427 --> 05:28.694
who is?

05:28.728 --> 05:31.899
Oh, no!

Thirty years ago

05:41.242 --> 05:43.110
you cosplaying assholes

05:43.142 --> 05:44.478
trapped me in a book.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.880
Time to return the favor.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.216
[grunts]

05:49.250 --> 05:51.017

get away with--

Shut the hell up, sexy.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.389
[Queen of Fables laughs]

05:55.423 --> 05:56.557
Word of advice,

05:56.591 --> 05:58.728
do not smell Rapunzel's hair.

05:58.762 --> 06:01.495
Ain't no shower in that tower.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.396
[Harley] Queen!
Oh, You really saved the day.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.232
I guess not killin' ya
worked out pretty well.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.533
Not really.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.269
Quick question.
Can any of you fly?

06:08.302 --> 06:09.870
-In a plane.
-Every night in my dreams.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.038
-[Sy] Ha! outta diesel.
-No. I'm basically a rock.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.875
Good.

[all screaming]

06:32.259 --> 06:35.362
[Harley] Ow!

06:35.396 --> 06:37.132
Holy mackerel, we're up high!

06:37.165 --> 06:39.901
I've never been this far
above sea level before.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.802
All right. Calm down,
calm down, don't panic.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.937
Here's a surefire trick
to combat,

06:43.937 --> 06:45.072
uh, way-up-aphobia.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.209
Pick a spot in the horizon
and stare at it.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.644
Oh, wait,
that's for sea sickness.

06:49.644 --> 06:50.911
What are we, on a cloud now?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.680
[sighs] Yeah. Looks like
Fables' teamed up

06:52.713 --> 06:54.048
with the Legion
to kill us.

06:54.048 --> 06:55.583
God, she turned out
to be a bad friend.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.252
Hey-hey,
I'm already bored up here.

06:57.252 --> 06:59.452
Do your stupid plant thing
and get us the hell down. Okay?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.622
You know I can't control
fairy tale plants,

07:01.656 --> 07:02.689
you balding gremlin.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.559
How would I have know that?

07:04.591 --> 07:06.394
When would that have come up?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.896
Actually, Fables
may have done us a solid.

07:08.930 --> 07:13.334
Seems much safer up here
than down there.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.103
[giant] Fee fi fo...

07:16.103 --> 07:17.103
Ah, fuck me.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.406
[giant] ...fum.

07:18.406 --> 07:21.675
I smell the blood
of small human scum.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.476
Okay, we need a way down. Now.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.278
I say we make like Jack,

07:25.312 --> 07:26.713
climb down the beanstalk,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.482
chop it down, kill the giant,

07:28.516 --> 07:30.117
French kiss Rapunzel. Done.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.653
keep your creepy
bionic hands off Rapunzel.

07:32.687 --> 07:34.156
[giant] I'll grind your bones

07:34.189 --> 07:36.925
to bake my bread!

07:36.958 --> 07:39.427
Come on! How the hell
are we gettin' off this thing?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.928
I know just what we need.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.363
An idea.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.132
Yes, who's got one?

07:45.165 --> 07:46.634
[sighs] Okay.

07:46.668 --> 07:48.235
I know who can help us.

07:48.269 --> 07:49.502
Sy, give me your phone.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.838
'Ey, wait, wait, wait,
not so fast.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.406
-Give it.
-Is it a local call?

07:53.440 --> 07:57.043
Just fuckin' hand it over.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.112
[sniffs] Ugh!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.281
What do you think, Bill-doe?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.716
Any thoughts on this kite?

08:01.716 --> 08:03.084
I'm kinda stuck
on this last piece, like...

08:03.084 --> 08:05.552
Oh, check it out,
my girlfriend's calling.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.088
What up, babe?

08:07.088 --> 08:08.622
[whispers] It's Ivy.
It's my girlfriend.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.225
Yeah, no,
I'm just designing a kite.

08:10.225 --> 08:12.358
Yeah, trying to put my own
little spin-a-roonie on it.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.728
Wha... What's that?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.529
I'll head right over!

08:16.564 --> 08:19.500
I... I love you.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.834
She didn't say it back.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.137
It's probably
just bad reception.

08:22.170 --> 08:23.971
Plus, she probably
didn't want to say it

08:23.971 --> 08:26.372
in front of her work friends.

08:26.406 --> 08:30.011
[grunting]

08:30.043 --> 08:32.546
Wait, you have Kite Man's
number memorized?

08:32.546 --> 08:33.581
[loud footsteps approaching]

08:33.581 --> 08:37.331
Oh, no, the giant's here.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.455
[roaring]

08:42.456 --> 08:44.258
[all screaming]

08:44.291 --> 08:45.558
[yells]

08:45.592 --> 08:47.061
[yelps]

08:47.095 --> 08:48.428
You didn't...
You didn't answer
my question.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.496
How do you know
his number?

08:49.496 --> 08:50.496
Uh...

08:50.496 --> 08:52.466
How big do you think
that giant's dick is?

08:52.466 --> 08:53.668
I do want to
talk about that,

08:53.701 --> 08:54.934
but answer my question.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.203
[stomping]

08:57.236 --> 09:00.142
[giant yells]

09:00.176 --> 09:03.443
Fine. I'm...
I'm dating Kite Man.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.613
What? [grunts]

09:05.645 --> 09:07.947
[screaming]

09:07.980 --> 09:09.450
Ha! Got ya!

09:09.482 --> 09:11.485
You're dating Kite Man?

09:11.485 --> 09:13.886
Why?

09:13.919 --> 09:15.121
Uh...

09:15.154 --> 09:17.158
You...You love him?

09:17.158 --> 09:19.592
I haven't said, like,
"I love you" to him,

09:19.626 --> 09:22.562
but, yeah,
I love him a little.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.431
How do we not know about this?

09:24.431 --> 09:25.432
[giant grunts]

09:25.466 --> 09:26.868
Because you never asked.

09:26.868 --> 09:27.934
-I mean, It's like...
-[cackling]

09:27.934 --> 09:29.168
...if it's not about you...

09:29.202 --> 09:30.303
you're not interested.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.505
I wasn't even
trying very hard

09:31.505 --> 09:32.505
to keep it a secret.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.573
I kept coming home,

09:33.606 --> 09:34.741
reeking of kite,

09:34.774 --> 09:36.076
leaves in my hair.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.879
Didn't you ever think
that was weird?

09:37.912 --> 09:40.581
You seriously
didn't know, Quinn?

09:40.614 --> 09:43.817
Show of hands for everybody
who knew. Bingo.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.253
[Clayface screams]

09:45.253 --> 09:46.586
-[Sy] Oy vey!
-[King Shark] Watch your hand!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.322
[laughs maliciously]

09:49.355 --> 09:53.226
[groans]

09:53.226 --> 09:54.193
Ho!

09:54.193 --> 09:55.395
[all] Kite Man!

09:55.428 --> 09:56.663
Oh, yeah.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.032
I tossed a hot sauce
packet at him

09:58.032 --> 09:59.734
that I found
inside my pants.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.134
It's Sriracha.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.168
[all screaming]

10:02.201 --> 10:03.201
Our fave, babe.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.572
[screaming continues]

10:04.572 --> 10:05.572
I gotcha.

10:05.572 --> 10:09.476
[all screaming]

10:09.509 --> 10:12.346
-Ah!
-[Kite Man] Ha!

10:12.379 --> 10:16.048
[screaming]

10:16.082 --> 10:19.186
[screaming]

10:19.219 --> 10:22.225
[screaming]

10:22.259 --> 10:25.225
[screaming]

10:25.259 --> 10:26.693
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

10:26.726 --> 10:27.961
Thanks, babe.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.230
I never got
the kite thing until now,

10:30.264 --> 10:33.033
but it is quite majestic.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.235
[Kite Man] Uh. Might want to
hold on tight there, gang.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.538
Looks like
your crew's packing
a few extra lbs.

10:38.572 --> 10:39.673
Not you, babe.

10:39.706 --> 10:44.206
You look bangin'.
As per ushe.

10:46.113 --> 10:50.250
[yelling]

10:50.283 --> 10:52.318
-[groans]
-[grunts]

10:52.318 --> 10:53.318
Ugh!

10:53.318 --> 10:54.587
[moaning passionately]

10:54.621 --> 10:55.822
Thanks for the ride, babe.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.792
Babe, anytime.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.659
-Ugh!
-Oh, sick.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.327
I can't get hold of
the Justice League.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.629
But I found Scarecrow... wait.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.831
Are you wearing a helmet?

11:03.865 --> 11:05.499
Are you on a tank?

11:05.533 --> 11:06.600
[scoffs] No,

11:06.634 --> 11:09.203
I'm... riding my skateboard.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.772
-What?
-The situation's gotten
more dire, all right?

11:11.806 --> 11:15.408
Desperate times
call for... tanks.

11:15.442 --> 11:19.816
-[laughing]
-Argh!

11:19.849 --> 11:22.082
Men... and Cheryl,

11:22.115 --> 11:25.451
let's remind these trees
what they're good for,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.221
letting a dog piss all over--

11:27.254 --> 11:29.090
[knocking]

11:29.123 --> 11:31.292
Hey, Gordo. Love the helmet.

11:31.326 --> 11:34.729
But I think
it'd look better on me.

11:34.761 --> 11:37.461
[muffled mumbling]

11:43.370 --> 11:45.806
Anyone have
a Class B commercial license?

11:45.840 --> 11:48.542
Dude! You look so good
popping out of a tank.

11:48.576 --> 11:51.330
It's mostly the helmet.
[chuckles]

11:51.799 --> 11:53.614
[Harley] Scarecrow and those
Legion of Doom Dicks

11:53.614 --> 11:55.115
were behind this
from the start.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.551
And screw Fables
for joining 'em.

11:57.585 --> 11:59.754
I hereby tender my resignation.

11:59.754 --> 12:01.788
I hope it's
effective immediately

12:01.822 --> 12:04.322
because I am squished.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.230
[Clayface] Good Lord!

12:09.264 --> 12:11.498
This tank shoots
invisible missiles.

12:11.532 --> 12:12.899
What miraculous tech.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.534
I didn't press the button.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.736
Someone else
just blew it up.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.971
But who?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.642
[rattling]

12:31.851 --> 12:34.153
[cackling]

12:34.187 --> 12:35.222
What?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.993
The Joker actually built
that stupid tower

12:36.993 --> 12:39.393
to take over Gotham?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.927
Although, he did use my idea

12:40.927 --> 12:41.927
to have it pop
out of the ground.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.600
Um... Yay?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.366
Citizens of Gotham,

12:46.400 --> 12:49.236
the Legion of Doom
used to stand for something.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.772
Now, it's not
standing at all!

12:51.806 --> 12:54.307
[laughs maniacally]

12:54.341 --> 12:55.456
You can't see them,

12:55.456 --> 12:57.278
but that joke killed
with the camera crew,

12:57.312 --> 12:58.980
and they're the
toughest audience
to make laugh

12:59.013 --> 13:01.014
and they see
this shit everyday.
Anyway.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.650
The Legion of Doom
used to stand for something,

13:03.683 --> 13:05.219
top tier evil.

13:05.253 --> 13:08.422
But now,
they'll let in any, say...

13:08.455 --> 13:09.756
second-rate clown

13:09.789 --> 13:11.359
with a cheap dye job.

13:11.392 --> 13:12.994
-[laughs maniacally]
-How dare he.

13:13.027 --> 13:15.796
I go to a very
high-end salon weekly.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.397
Harls, I've seen you neck deep

13:17.431 --> 13:18.666
in six different bottles

13:18.698 --> 13:20.902
of that bullshit you buy
at the drugstore.

13:20.902 --> 13:22.102
Damn it, I forgot
you were here.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.004
The Legion is no more.

13:24.038 --> 13:26.306
Gotham, you deserve better,

13:26.340 --> 13:27.640
someone with vision,

13:27.674 --> 13:29.610
someone who speaks French,

13:29.610 --> 13:32.645
<i>moi,</i> of course.

13:32.679 --> 13:37.451
[laughs maniacally]

13:37.484 --> 13:38.753
I'm calling it!

13:38.785 --> 13:41.488
RIP, Gotham City,

13:41.522 --> 13:44.457
time of death...

13:44.490 --> 13:45.893
Right now!

13:45.927 --> 13:48.629
[siren blaring in distance]

13:48.662 --> 13:50.331
[laughing maniacally]

13:50.365 --> 13:52.166
Oh. He's going down.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.768
All right, everybody
back in the tank.

13:53.801 --> 13:56.169
If you need to pee,
now's your chance.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.873
[loudly] I want you
war-crazed lunatics...

13:58.905 --> 14:00.240
[softly] ...and Cheryl,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.308
[loudly] to unleash
holy hell on that tower.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.379
Unleashing, sir.

14:04.412 --> 14:06.447
-[growling]
-[tank cop screaming]

14:06.480 --> 14:08.849
[screaming]

14:08.883 --> 14:10.350
What the fuck!

14:10.384 --> 14:13.854
[all screaming]

14:13.888 --> 14:15.423
Uh. I hate to be a downer,

14:15.456 --> 14:18.692
but we are completely
and utterly screwed.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.794
Oh, I wore that well.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.996
Hmm. Maybe I don't
hate being a downer.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.799
Ooh, maybe I shouldn't
feel so much pressure

14:25.799 --> 14:28.251
to put a positive spin
on things.

14:30.071 --> 14:31.871
Well, I think
we fucked up

14:31.871 --> 14:34.475
everyone that needed it.

14:34.508 --> 14:35.643
[spits]

14:35.676 --> 14:36.910
What is this
weak-ass drink?

14:36.943 --> 14:38.312
This one of your jokes?

14:38.345 --> 14:39.447
It's 1:30,

14:39.480 --> 14:42.216
I'm not getting fucked up
on a Wednesday.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.250
[yells] And by the way...

14:43.250 --> 14:44.851
why is Harley still alive?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.287
You said you
took care of them!

14:46.321 --> 14:48.089
I threw 'em
on top of a beanstalk.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.823
"Took care of"
means kill them.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.759
Not beanstalk them!

14:51.792 --> 14:53.027
I was trying to kill them,

14:53.059 --> 14:55.129
just in a fun
and cinematic way.

14:55.163 --> 14:57.331
That big-dicked giant
kills everything.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.599
Apparently not!

14:58.631 --> 14:59.732
You joined me,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.101
because you said
you wanted to be

15:01.134 --> 15:02.769
on the winning team.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.905
Well, we can't win
until they're dead.

15:05.940 --> 15:09.243
Fine. I'll kill 'em normal.

15:09.277 --> 15:11.077
With the Justice League missing

15:11.111 --> 15:13.181
and no sign of Batman,

15:13.214 --> 15:17.317
we're all just
pawns in the hands
of a murderous psychopath.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.086
[inaudible]

15:20.120 --> 15:23.256
And what better hands to be in?

15:23.291 --> 15:25.225
They're firm,
they're strong,

15:25.259 --> 15:27.865
and they're covered in
soft, soft gloves.

15:27.898 --> 15:30.096
In other news,

15:30.130 --> 15:34.235
are hideous scars on your face
actually awesome?

15:34.268 --> 15:35.436
And yet, they're only

15:35.470 --> 15:37.638
the second
most evil news network.

15:37.671 --> 15:38.839
Right guys?

15:38.873 --> 15:40.240
-Anyone?
-We gotta get those trees

15:40.240 --> 15:41.808
away from the tower
so we can stop Joker.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.610
Perhaps, I could
take on the role

15:43.644 --> 15:44.812
of an arborist

15:44.845 --> 15:47.715
and slowly
trim them back to death.

15:47.748 --> 15:49.149
It could take years,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.618
but this green-thumbed
plant enthusiast

15:51.652 --> 15:53.254
is up to the challenge!

15:53.287 --> 15:54.556
Yeah, okay, you know what,

15:54.589 --> 15:56.756
I'm gonna go
and draw the trees away

15:56.789 --> 15:58.125
from the tower.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.527
Ive, be, uh, you know,
careful and shit.

16:00.561 --> 16:02.696
You too. And shit.

16:02.730 --> 16:03.764
Come on, babe.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.933
Let's go mow that lawn.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.903
So this guy
really does it for you?

16:08.936 --> 16:10.270
You know, one-on-one...

16:10.303 --> 16:11.772
[hesitantly] he... He...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.874
Uh... [sighs]

16:13.908 --> 16:16.277
Uh, fuck you, Psycho!
I don't know.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.780
[soft happy music plays]

16:19.813 --> 16:21.081
[panting]

16:21.115 --> 16:22.316
Are you okay?

16:22.350 --> 16:24.618
Kite Man doesn't
run a lot. [gasping]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.254
Uses kites, mostly. Phew!

16:26.288 --> 16:28.522
This water
made the plants huge,

16:28.554 --> 16:30.124
and I am part plant.

16:30.124 --> 16:31.626
So, it could have
the same effect on me.

16:31.626 --> 16:34.195
I know I can't stop you
from doing this,

16:34.227 --> 16:35.462
so in case it kills you

16:35.495 --> 16:37.130
or gives you
really bad diarrhea...

16:37.130 --> 16:38.768
-Um...
-...I couldn't live
with myself,

16:38.801 --> 16:41.067
-if I didn't ask you...
-Wait, what are you...

16:41.067 --> 16:42.135
...this special question.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.437
[Poison Ivy] Oh, dear.

16:43.471 --> 16:47.140
Will you do me
the honor of making me...

16:47.174 --> 16:48.575
-Mr...
-There's no box.

16:48.609 --> 16:50.409
...Poison Ivy?

16:50.443 --> 16:53.615
Um... Uh...

16:53.648 --> 16:55.149
[stuttering]
You know what, let's...

16:55.182 --> 16:56.317
Let's circle back on this?

16:56.350 --> 16:58.451
Just maybe
after the apocalypse?

16:58.485 --> 16:59.687
Right?

16:59.720 --> 17:00.956
[kisses]

17:00.989 --> 17:02.655
[sighs softly]

17:02.690 --> 17:04.458
Not a no.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.141
Hell, yeah!

17:28.148 --> 17:29.584
All right, guys.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.051
Look, I know
none of this
is your fault.

17:31.085 --> 17:33.086
And I'm sorry for what

How did you manage
to hollow out the
innards of that beast?

20:10.545 --> 20:12.614
Well, a lot of people ask me

20:12.646 --> 20:15.784
who would win between
a wolf and a shark.
