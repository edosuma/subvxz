WEBVTT

00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:09.542 --> 00:11.500
SO, UH, SURFING, HUH?
YOU'RE INTO SURFING NOW?

00:11.542 --> 00:14.500
YOU SHOULD SEE HER ROOM.
SHE'S GOT SURF POSTERS
EVERYWHERE.

00:14.542 --> 00:17.625
AS SOON AS MY HEART IS BETTER,
I'M GONNA HAVE

00:17.667 --> 00:20.041
A BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE BEACH,
AND I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO SURF.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.333
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM
FROM MY WINDOW,

00:22.375 --> 00:24.750
AND IT'S TOTALLY COOL.
THAT SOUNDS TOTALLY AWESOME.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.542
SO HOW'S OUR PATIENT DOING?
ANNIE, THIS IS DR. BARNES.

00:27.583 --> 00:30.041
DR. BARNES IS GONNA REMOVE
THE TUMOR FROM YOUR HEART.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHER GUY?

00:30.083 --> 00:32.417
(whispering) THIS GUY'S
MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY.

00:32.458 --> 00:35.750
DR. BARNES IS
THE BEST HEART GUY IN L.A.

00:35.792 --> 00:38.166
THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR LAST
SURGERY. THAT'S HOW GOOD HE IS.

00:38.208 --> 00:41.333
AND SO I SNAGGED HIM FOR YOU
BECAUSE I'M ON YOUR SIDE. RIGHT?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.458
(Cooper) RIGHT.
WELL, IT IS A 6-HOUR PROCEDURE,
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.333
RIGHT, ANNIE?
YOU'LL BE HERE
WHEN I COME OUT?

00:47.375 --> 00:49.458
(Cooper, normal voice)
I'LL BE HERE.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.875
DON'T LOOK SO SCARED.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.291
FINISHING OR STARTING?

01:21.333 --> 01:22.792
FINISHING. YOU?

01:22.834 --> 01:24.291
STARTING.
MM.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.917
I'VE GOT MYOCARDIAL RESECTION
ON A KID.

01:26.959 --> 01:28.458
I HATE WORKING ON KIDS.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.208
I FEEL LIKE I'M HOLDING
MY BREATH THE ENTIRE TIME.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.208
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
I WORK ON BABIES SOMETIMES.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.041
OH. SO YOU, UH,
SO YOU COME HERE OFTEN?

01:37.083 --> 01:38.834
(laughs) WAS--

01:38.875 --> 01:42.041
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDED LIKE A--
WAS THAT A PICKUP LINE?

01:42.083 --> 01:44.542
(laughs) NO.
(laughs) NO?

01:44.583 --> 01:46.041
THAT, UH, I APOLOGIZE.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.208
OKAY.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.750
BESIDES, I WOULD, UM...

01:49.792 --> 01:54.000
I WOULD GIVE
A BETTER PICKUP LINE THAN THAT.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.041
HELLO. HELLO. HEL--
I'M--I'M NOT INTO THIS.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.875
THE BUG NEEDS STIMULATION.
I'M THE PEDIATRICIAN.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.709
THIS IS MY AREA.
HELLO, LITTLE ONE.

02:07.750 --> 02:09.458
HELLO.
HEY, GUYS.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.500
I'M STIMULATING THE BUG.
WE'VE MADE A DECISION.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.667
TOGETHER?
PATERNITY TEST, NOW.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.750
ONE OF US
GETS OUT OF YOUR HAIR,

02:15.792 --> 02:18.041
THE OTHER ONE
HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW.
LOOK, GUYS--

02:18.083 --> 02:20.041
YOU KNOW WHAT, COOPER?
YOU MOVED IN, YOU PUSHED US OUT,

02:20.083 --> 02:22.375
YOU'VE CLAIMED YOUR TERRITORY,
BUT ONE THING IS CLEAR--

02:22.417 --> 02:24.458
THIS KID YOU'RE TALKING TO
IS NOT YOUR KID.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.375
SO STAY OUT OF IT.
LOOK, PETE--

02:26.417 --> 02:29.041
(cell phone rings)
THE ANSWER IS RIGHT THERE
FOR US TO KNOW.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.041
WE KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO FACE IT, BUT WE DO.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.709
I'VE GOTTA GO.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.041
WELL...

02:35.083 --> 02:37.291
I HAVE
NO DEFINING EXIT LINE,

02:37.333 --> 02:39.000
SO...

02:44.542 --> 02:45.959
(exhales)

02:46.000 --> 02:47.750
THEY TOLD ME
IT WAS A CARJACKING.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.375
THEY TOLD YOU?
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

02:50.417 --> 02:52.375
I REMEMBER
LEAVING SOCCER PRACTICE.

02:52.417 --> 02:56.041
I'D PARKED ACROSS CAMPUS
IN STUDENT PARKING.

02:56.083 --> 02:59.041
I GOT TO MY CAR.
THERE WERE PEOPLE AROUND.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.417
I PULLED OUT MY KEYS,

03:01.458 --> 03:04.291
AND I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND ME,
AND...

03:04.333 --> 03:05.625
AND?

03:05.667 --> 03:08.792
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER.
WOKE UP IN THE AMBULANCE.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.792
I LOVED THAT CAR.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.792
I LOVE SCHOOL.

03:12.834 --> 03:16.041
THIS GUY CAME INTO MY WORLD
AND... OH, I'M PISSED.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.542
I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE
OUR PSYCHIATRIST DR. TURNER.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.041
REALLY? 'CAUSE OTHER THAN
PISSED, I'M OKAY.

03:21.083 --> 03:24.375
JUST... DO ME THE FAVOR
SO YOU STAY THAT WAY.

03:24.417 --> 03:26.250
YOU KNOW
WHAT'LL MAKE ME OKAY?

03:26.291 --> 03:33.667
WHEN THEY CATCH THIS GUY.

03:33.709 --> 03:37.041
(arguing indistinctly)

03:37.083 --> 03:40.083
(arguing indistinctly)

03:44.333 --> 03:46.792
(Violet, Cooper, Sam and Sonya
continue arguing indistinctly)

03:46.834 --> 03:48.291
ARE YOU SNOOPING?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.792
UH, THIS IS PUBLIC SPACE.
I'M JUST STANDING HERE.

03:50.834 --> 03:53.792
SNOOPING.
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON OR NOT?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.291
OF COURSE I DO.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.375
OKAY, POSSIBLE BABY DADDIES
DEMANDED PATERNITY TEST.

03:57.417 --> 03:58.500
(Addison) WHEW.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.917
SAID MY NAME
DURING SEX WITH HER.
NO!

04:00.959 --> 04:02.458
OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.917
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS,
JUST BY WATCHING?

04:04.959 --> 04:08.041
WHAT, DO YOU READ LIPS NOW?
WELL, NO, SAM TOLD ME
THE WHOLE NAME THING.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.041
WH--
WHAT? WE ARE FRIENDS.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.709
HE TELLS ME STUFF.
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
(gasps)

04:12.750 --> 04:15.041
AND VIOLET WAS YELLING
SO LOUD, IT JUST...

04:15.083 --> 04:17.041
(laughs) OH, GOD.
HE CALLED OUT YOUR NAME.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.041
DON'T--
I'M THE ONLY PERSON THAT
THE MAN HAS HAD SEX WITH

04:20.083 --> 04:21.750
IN THE LAST 15 YEARS.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.750
IT WAS JUST HABIT.
THAT'S ALL.
MM-HMM.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.834
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
(Violet) DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING? IT'S INCREDIBLE.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.667
I WISH SOMEONE WOULD CALL OUT

04:27.709 --> 04:29.667
ANOTHER WOMAN'S NAME
IN BED WITH ME.

04:29.709 --> 04:32.667
HELL, I'D EVEN TAKE NOT KNOWING
WHO THE FATHER OF MY BABY WAS.

04:32.709 --> 04:35.667
EITHER WAY, IT WOULD MEAN
THAT I'D HAD A MAN ON TOP OF ME

04:35.709 --> 04:37.667
IN RECENT HISTORY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S REALLY SAD.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.125
I KNOW. I THOUGHT SOMEBODY
WAS TRYING TO PICK ME UP...
MM-HMM.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.458
AND--AND I FELT MY KNEES OPEN
JUST A LITTLE BIT.
UH, COME ON. I DON'T WANT
TO SPOIL THE FUN,

04:43.500 --> 04:45.875
BUT I'VE GOT BETSEY
WITH ME TODAY,

04:45.917 --> 04:47.667
AND "SAY MY NAME"
AND "WHO'S YOUR DADDY"

04:47.709 --> 04:50.250
ARE GETTING A LITTLE LOUD,
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

04:50.291 --> 04:52.709
EXPLAIN WHAT A PATERNITY TEST IS
TO MY 6 YEAR OLD.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.792
I'M NOT TELLING 'EM
TO SHUT UP.
OH, NO, NO, ME NEITHER.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.875
I WILL HAVE
A PATERNITY TEST

04:57.917 --> 05:01.041
WHEN I WANT TO HAVE
A PATERNITY TEST.
YOU CAN'T DO ONE
FOR A FEW WEEKS ANYWAY.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.041
WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE,
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO?

05:04.083 --> 05:06.959
IT'S MY BODY.
IT'S MY UTERUS.
YOU CAN'T DO ONE
FOR A FEW WEEKS ANYWAY.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.875
I MEAN, YES, YES, I WAS...
A LITTLE BIT IRRESPONSIBLE,

05:08.917 --> 05:11.542
HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX
WITH TWO MEN,

05:11.583 --> 05:14.667
BUT DOES THAT GIVE THEM
THE RIGHT TO DICTATE--
VIOLET, YOU CAN'T DO A C.V.S.
PATERNITY TEST FOR A FEW WEEKS.

05:14.709 --> 05:17.083
THE POINT IS MUTE.
MOOT.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.500
THE POINT IS MOOT.
IS IT "MOOT"?
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S "MUTE."

05:19.542 --> 05:21.625
NO, IT'S MOOT.
THE POINT IS MOOT.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.625
I CAN'T HAVE
A PATERNITY TEST FOR WEEKS.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.333
(scoffs)
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO...

05:26.375 --> 05:29.750
I NEED YOU TO SEE A PATIENT.
IS THE POINT MOOT
OR IS THE POINT MUTE?

05:31.583 --> 05:33.667
ANNIE'S OUT OF SURGERY.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.000
WHERE'S THE PATIENT?

05:39.041 --> 05:41.000
YOU WERE IN BED WITH ME,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.000
AND YOU CALLED OUT
ANOTHER WOMAN'S NAME.
I KNOW, AND, UH, IT WAS WRONG,

05:43.041 --> 05:45.500
BUT I-I WAS NOT
THINKING ABOUT HER.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.959
I-I--IT JUST SLIPPED OUT.
I-I PROMISE.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.500
SONYA, WHAT--
PLEASE, WHAT ARE YOU--
WELL, I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.208
AND YOU'VE EXPLAINED YOURSELF
AS BEST YOU COULD, I GUESS.
WELL, HAVE A GOOD DAY, SONYA.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.333
SEE? THERE. SONYA. SEE?
I S--I KNOW IT.

05:56.375 --> 05:59.250
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
SONYA. SONYA. SON--

05:59.291 --> 06:00.333
(smack)

06:00.375 --> 06:01.792
(grunts)

06:03.250 --> 06:05.208
YOU'RE JUST
IN THE DOGHOUSE, YOU KNOW?

06:05.250 --> 06:07.333
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO SUFFER,

06:07.375 --> 06:08.792
JUST FOR A LITTLE BIT.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.583
MAYBE I SHOULD
MAKE HER DINNER TONIGHT,

06:10.625 --> 06:12.750
YOU KNOW, GO ALL OUT--
CANDLELIGHT, FLOWERS, THE WORKS.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.750
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU NEED TO TAKE HER OUT.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.458
TAKE HER OUT SOMEWHERE NICE,
SOMEWHERE ROMANTIC.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.166
THE BLUE SEA IN MALIBU.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.417
THE BLUE SEA,
THE PLACE WE USED TO GO?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.542
YEAH, THE PLACE WITH
THE GREAT MIMOSAS

06:25.583 --> 06:28.875
THAT YOU DRANK
WAY TOO MANY OF.
THE BLUE SEA. YEAH,
THAT S-SOUNDS PERFECT.

06:28.917 --> 06:31.417
THE MEMORY LOSS
IS NOT UNUSUAL,

06:31.458 --> 06:33.625
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
A BAD THING.

06:33.667 --> 06:36.875
YOU'RE PROTECTING YOURSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF.
I WANT TO REMEMBER.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.875
THE MEMORY
MAY COME OUT NATURALLY,

06:38.917 --> 06:41.375
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO DEAL WITH IT.
I'M READY TO DEAL WITH IT.

06:41.417 --> 06:44.166
I WANT TO HELP THE POLICE
FIND THIS GUY,

06:44.208 --> 06:47.083
AND I CAN'T UNLESS I REMEMBER.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A VICTIM.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.625
I WANT TO FIND THIS GUY
AND RIP HIS THROAT OUT.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.041
OKAY.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.291
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.166
OKAY.

07:01.208 --> 07:05.291
SO I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT
SOMETHING YOU LIKE.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.458
GRIFFITH PARK.
I LIKE RIDING HORSES.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.834
GOOD.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.875
SO I WANT YOU TO SEE IT
IN YOUR MIND,

07:12.917 --> 07:14.875
LIKE YOU'RE SITTING
IN A MOVIE THEATER

07:14.917 --> 07:17.709
WATCHING IT ON A SCREEN.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.625
DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SEE.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.125
THE HORSE IS CHESTNUT

07:21.166 --> 07:24.500
WITH A WHITE STREAK
DOWN THE SIDE OF HIS NECK.

07:24.542 --> 07:27.417
WE'RE RIDING OFF THE TRAIL,
UP A HILL,

07:27.458 --> 07:31.417
THEN WE CUT THROUGH
SOME TREES, CANTERING.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.709
GOOD.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.875
SO YOU'RE RELAXED,
AND YOU'RE FEELING THAT,

07:36.917 --> 07:40.917
ONLY THE PICTURE ON THE SCREEN
IS GOING TO CHANGE.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.917
FOCUS ON THE SCREEN.

07:42.959 --> 07:47.333
YOU SEE YOUR CAR,
YOU SEE YOURSELF.

07:47.375 --> 07:48.500
OKAY.

07:48.542 --> 07:52.041
NOW DON'T BRING EVERYTHING
INTO FOCUS,

07:52.083 --> 07:55.250
AND YOU CAN LOOK AWAY
ANYTIME YOU NEED TO.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.750
BUT DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ATTACKER?

08:00.125 --> 08:03.458
HIS ARM... HIS HAND.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.417
HE WAS WHITE.
THE GUY WAS WHITE.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.125
I CAN REMEMBER THIS,
CAN'T I?

08:11.166 --> 08:13.709
YOU CAN HELP ME REMEMBER?

08:13.750 --> 08:16.500
I'LL TRY.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.500
IT ALWAYS STARTS
WITH THE CRAMPING.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.500
MY HUSBAND AND I
CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.041
I-I DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM
THIS TIME BECAUSE I--

08:24.083 --> 08:26.208
WE JUST CAN'T TAKE LOSING
ANOTHER--

08:26.250 --> 08:28.208
WELL, MISCARRYING ONCE
IS HARD ENOUGH.

08:28.250 --> 08:30.583
BUT TWICE MUST BE--
WE'RE NOT EVEN TELLING
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

08:30.625 --> 08:32.959
ABOUT THE BABY THIS TIME.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.041
I THINK I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE CRAMPING.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.041
THE PLACENTA IS IMPLANTING
LOW ON THE UTERINE WALL,

08:39.083 --> 08:43.041
AND THAT CAN CAUSE BLEEDING
AS THE PREGNANCY PROGRESSES.
IS THAT DANGEROUS?

08:43.083 --> 08:45.542
WELL, IT CAN BE UNLESS
WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

08:45.583 --> 08:49.041
AND IN THIS CASE, YOU CAN.
SURE. WHAT? ANYTHING.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.041
NO SEX.
NO SEX IS THE TREATMENT?

08:52.083 --> 08:53.959
MM-HMM.
REALLY?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.041
YEP.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.750
OH, WOW. OKAY.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.959
SO... NO SEX.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.333
OH, WE'LL JUST SPEND
OUR EVENINGS READING...

09:02.375 --> 09:05.000
(laughs)
AND TALKING
AND NOT HAVING SEX.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.041
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

09:07.083 --> 09:09.333
I'M NOT HAVING
ANY SEX EITHER.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.500
(laughs)
(laughs)

09:13.625 --> 09:16.417
ANNIE, YOUR TUMOR WAS BIGGER
THAN WE EXPECTED.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.875
WE WEREN'T ABLE
TO REMOVE ALL OF IT.
(Cooper)
BUT DR. BARNES THINKS

09:19.917 --> 09:22.667
THAT MORE CHEMO WILL SHRINK
THIS TUMOR,

09:22.709 --> 09:25.917
AND IN ANOTHER MONTH,
HE CAN TAKE IT OUT COMPLETELY.

09:25.959 --> 09:29.458
(voice breaking) THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID LAST TIME...

09:29.500 --> 09:31.667
AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.625
AND THEN THIS
WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.208
BUT NONE OF IT HELPS.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.792
JUST MORE HOSPITALS...
MORE MEDICATION,

09:37.834 --> 09:41.291
STAYING INSIDE ALL THE TIME.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.500
I DON'T WANT ANYMORE.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.875
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
IT'LL BE OKAY. YOU'LL SEE.

09:46.917 --> 09:50.834
NO, IT WON'T.
I DON'T WANT ANYMORE SURGERY.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.417
PLEASE.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.959
YOU PROMISED
YOU WERE ON MY SIDE.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.959
TELL THEM NO MORE SURGERY.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
(sighs)

10:14.083 --> 10:17.041
FINISHING OR STARTING?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.500
FINISHING. YOU?

10:18.542 --> 10:19.875
STARTING.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.750
OUR TIMING.
(laughs)

10:22.792 --> 10:25.542
MY PICKUP LINES
ARE USUALLY JUST HONESTY.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.333
I DON'T HAVE ANY LINES.

10:28.375 --> 10:31.041
OKAY.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.000
FOR INSTANCE?

10:34.917 --> 10:37.583
HONESTY?
HONESTY.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.417
YOU ARE
BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY,

10:47.125 --> 10:50.041
YOU KNOW, IF I WERE
TRYING TO PICK YOU UP.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.375
HOW WAS THAT?

10:52.417 --> 10:54.166
TH-THAT WAS GOOD.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.041
YOU MISSED THE WINDOW.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.542
FOR THE C.V.S. TEST.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.625
THE RISKS OF PUNCTURING
THE PLACENTA--
MINIMAL.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.500
YES, BUT IT'S--IT'S THERE.
VIOLET.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.166
OH, YOU, TOO?
SHE MISSED THE WINDOW.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.208
PATERNITY, C.V.S. WINDOW,
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S GONE.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.041
SO AMNIO? YOU'RE FAR ENOUGH
ALONG FOR AN AMNIO.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.709
WELL,
THERE ARE RISKS TO...

11:23.750 --> 11:25.792
UH, OKAY. I'LL CONSIDER IT.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.917
AND, UH, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
WILL YOU CONSIDER

11:28.959 --> 11:30.834
BACKING OFF WITH JILL?

11:30.875 --> 11:33.000
SHE'S IN MY OFFICE,
AND HER BODY IS A MESS.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.750
HER MUSCLE PAIN IS UNREAL.
WELL, SHE'S INJURED.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.458
SHE--SHE WAS INJURED
BEFORE THE ATTACK.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.625
YOU WERE TREATING HER.
FOR A ROTATOR CUFF TEAR.
SHE WAS GETTING BETTER.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.750
HER TREATMENT WAS NEARLY DONE.

11:42.792 --> 11:45.333
SINCE THE ATTACK--
HER INJURIES ARE NOT MUSCULAR.

11:45.375 --> 11:48.792
PULLING UP THOSE MEMORIES,
THAT'S WHAT'S EATING AT HER.
IF I CAN WALK HER
THROUGH THE ATTACK,

11:48.834 --> 11:51.875
THEN I CAN DESENSITIZE HER
TO THE MEMORY.
BUT THEN YOU RUN THE RISK
OF RETRAUMATIZING HER,

11:51.917 --> 11:55.000
WHICH HER BODY TELLS ME
IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
WITH A TRAUMA,

11:55.041 --> 11:58.000
IF SHE'S INTERNALIZING--I'VE
SEEN PEOPLE GET REALLY SICK.
OKAY, SO NOW

11:58.041 --> 12:00.250
YOU'RE GANGING UP ON ME
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

12:00.291 --> 12:02.875
I'M DOING
WHAT'S BEST FOR JILL.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.917
ARE THERE BUMPS
ALONG THE WAY? YES.

12:04.959 --> 12:07.834
BUT IN THE END, IT'S BEST
THAT SHE KNOWS NOW.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.375
SHE WANTS TO GET THIS GUY
WHO DID THIS TO HER.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.583
SO IF SHE REMEMBERS,
SHE CAN PUT HIM AWAY

12:12.625 --> 12:14.917
AND HAVE HER LIFE BACK.
OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:14.959 --> 12:17.834
SOMETIMES YOU THINK
IT'S BETTER TO KNOW.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.500
AND OTHERS...
DENIAL WORKS FOR YOU.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.792
JILL?

12:22.834 --> 12:25.583
JILL, WHAT IS IT?

12:25.625 --> 12:28.875
THE MAN WHO ATTACKED ME,
THEY THINK THEY FOUND HIM.

12:28.917 --> 12:32.834
THEY WANT ME TO COME IN
FOR A LINEUP.

12:34.750 --> 12:35.583
HEY.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.041
HELLO.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.291
YOUR FACE IS ALL SCOWLY.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.709
SCOWLY?

12:40.750 --> 12:43.500
WELL, YOU DIDN'T LIGHT UP
AS SOON AS YOU SAW ME.

12:43.542 --> 12:46.041
THIS IS ME, LIT.

12:46.083 --> 12:49.417
HEY, CHARLOTTE, WHAT...
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:49.458 --> 12:51.709
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN KIND OF...

12:51.750 --> 12:55.333
WE'VE BEEN IN A BETTER PLACE,
RIGHT? WE STARTED FRESH?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.834
YES. I SLEPT WITH ARCHER,
AND YOU FORGAVE ME.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.291
BETTER PLACE, FRESH START.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.000
BUT?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.542
BUT NOTHING.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.500
WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE,
COOP, REALLY.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.750
HEY.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.750
YOU'RE LOOKING--

13:14.792 --> 13:16.750
DON'T TELL ME I LOOK GOOD,
DR. FREEDMAN.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.125
BECAUSE I DON'T.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.792
OKAY, THANKS.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.542
WELL,
HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.542
I JUST LOOKED OVER YOUR LABS,

13:26.583 --> 13:28.667
AND THE CHEMO IS DOING
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.041
IT'S GETTING YOU READY
FOR THE SURGERY.
THE CHEMO IS MAKING ME SICK.

13:31.083 --> 13:34.083
I'VE TRIED TO TELL MY PARENTS
I DON'T WANT THIS SURGERY,

13:34.125 --> 13:36.583
BUT THEY WON'T LISTEN TO ME.
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

13:36.625 --> 13:39.542
BUT YOU GOTTA TRY
TO HANG IN THERE.
HANG IN FOR WHAT?

13:39.583 --> 13:41.792
I KNOW WHAT DR. BARNES
WANTS TO DO FOR ME.

13:41.834 --> 13:45.542
THE SURGERY STINKS. ONLY 20%
OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT

13:45.583 --> 13:48.542
LIVE FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.
AND THAT CAN BE YOU.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.500
I KNOW I'M SICK,

13:50.542 --> 13:52.750
AND MY HEART IS REALLY BAD,

13:52.792 --> 13:55.041
AND IF I DO NOTHING,
I'M GONNA DIE.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.041
BUT THIS SURGERY?

13:57.083 --> 13:59.041
CHANCES ARE
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.041
AND IF I WAS OFF
THIS MEDICATION,

14:01.083 --> 14:04.083
I COULD REALLY FEEL GOOD
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.792
I COULD PLAY
WITH MY FRIENDS AGAIN.

14:06.834 --> 14:10.500
(sighs) IF I HAD THIS
OUT OF MY ARM...

14:10.542 --> 14:13.125
I COULD GO IN THE OCEAN.

14:13.166 --> 14:16.709
I COULD BE NORMAL
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

14:16.750 --> 14:18.750
I'D RATHER HAVE ONE GOOD DAY

14:18.792 --> 14:22.166
THAN BE SICK
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.250
THE BLEEDING STARTED
THIS MORNING?
YES, IN THE SHOWER.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.250
I'VE BEEN DOING
EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME--

14:28.291 --> 14:30.250
NO SEX, TAKING IT EASY.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.750
I EVEN CUT BACK
MY HOURS AT WORK.

14:32.792 --> 14:35.041
THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING.
WELL, THE PLACENTA PREVIA
HASN'T IMPROVED.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.583
SO I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP LOSING BABIES...

14:37.625 --> 14:40.417
(voice breaking)
ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER?

14:40.458 --> 14:43.041
MORGAN, MORGAN, LOOK AT ME.
YOU ARE STRESSED.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.875
AND IF YOU'RE STRESSED,
THEN THE BABY'S STRESSED.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.375
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE
THIS BABY.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.000
IT JUST MEANS THAT WE NEED
TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE, OKAY?

14:50.041 --> 14:52.583
I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON
TOTAL BED REST FOR THE REMAINDER

14:52.625 --> 14:54.375
OF YOUR PREGNANCY,

14:54.417 --> 14:58.041
AND THEN I'M GONNA WATCH YOU
VERY CAREFULLY.
I-I WANT AN AMNIO.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.041
IF I'M GONNA LAY ON MY BACK
FOR FIVE MONTHS,

15:01.083 --> 15:03.792
I-I NEED TO KNOW THIS BABY'S
GONNA BE OKAY,

15:03.834 --> 15:05.709
YOU KNOW, THAT THERE AREN'T
ANY GENETIC DEFECTS.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.250
AN AMNIO IS USUALLY DONE
AT 17 WEEKS, MORGAN.

15:08.291 --> 15:11.000
WE NEED TO WAIT ANOTHER MONTH.
WHAT IF--

15:11.041 --> 15:13.083
NO WHAT-IFS.
WE'RE GONNA WAIT.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.083
WE'RE GONNA DO THE AMNIO
AT THE RIGHT TIME.
(cell phone rings)

15:16.125 --> 15:17.083
(beep)

15:17.125 --> 15:18.625
HI, HONEY.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.041
UH, YES,
I'M AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.041
SHE'S PUTTING ME ON BED REST.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.041
SHE'S NOT LETTING ME
INTO THE BED.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.750
THERE'S NO SEX.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.542
AND YOU NEED SEX.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.083
YEAH.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.750
I MEAN, HEY, I'M GROWN.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.667
(laughs)
DINNERS ARE COOL,
RESTAURANTS ARE COOL,

15:36.709 --> 15:39.709
BUT SHE HAS ME
SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.
OH, GOD. COME ON, SAM.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.709
BE SMART.
YOU GOTTA CHANGE THE SCENERY.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.709
YOU GOTTA MAKE HER FORGET
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:43.750 --> 15:46.500
YOU GOTTA... TAKE HER AWAY TO--
I DON'T KNOW, TAKE HER TO...

15:46.542 --> 15:50.333
(gasps) THE GRAND SPA
IN PALM SPRINGS.
I REMEMBER WE HAD
A REALLY GOOD TIME THERE.

15:50.375 --> 15:54.250
EXACTLY. THAT FIRST WEEKEND
AFTER MAYA, JUST THE TWO OF US.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.250
WE CERTAINLY
FORGOT ABOUT EVERYTHING.

15:56.291 --> 15:59.125
YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT.
THAT WAS FUN.
MM-HMM.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.041
I HAVE MAYA THIS WEEKEND,
THOUGH.
OH, I WILL TAKE MAYA. YOU GO.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.250
GO HAVE FUN.
GO WHISK HER AWAY.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.083
GO. WHISK.

16:06.125 --> 16:09.000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:09.041 --> 16:13.041
SHE'S MISERABLE AND SICK,
AND SHE DOESN'T WANT THIS.

16:13.083 --> 16:16.583
AND SHE MAKES SENSE,
BUT SHE'S ONLY 12.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.125
SHE STILL LOVES
STUFFED ANIMALS.

16:18.166 --> 16:21.583
SHE GIGGLES WHEN SHE HAS TO
TALK TO BOYS.
(laughs)

16:21.625 --> 16:24.041
ANYTIME THERE'S THUNDER,
SHE COMES TO SLEEP BETWEEN US.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.709
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HER,
BUT I CAN'T STAND FORCING HER

16:26.750 --> 16:28.750
TO DO SOMETHING THAT
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.792
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP HER?
(Barnes) I KNOW IT'S HARD,
WATCHING HER.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.834
BUT I THINK IF I OPERATE,
THERE'S A CHANCE SHE'LL MAKE IT.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.041
A CHANCE.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.583
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE SHOULD HAVE THE SURGERY?

16:41.750 --> 16:44.834
I DON'T WANNA...
THIS IS YOUR DECISION.

16:44.875 --> 16:47.709
I'M ASKING YOU. PLEASE.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.000
I THINK EVEN IN
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

16:50.041 --> 16:52.041
IT'S MONTHS IN A HOSPITAL,
CONSTANT DRUG THERAPIES

16:52.083 --> 16:55.041
AND INTERVENTIONS,
AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT A CURE.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.542
HOWEVER, CONSIDERING
THE ALTERNATIVE...

16:57.583 --> 17:00.458
WAIT A MINUTE.
GO ON, DR. COOPER.

17:00.500 --> 17:03.417
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

17:03.458 --> 17:07.041
UM... I THINK ANNIE HAS
CONSIDERED THE ALTERNATIVE.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.750
AND EVEN THOUGH IT TERRIFIES US,
FOR HER,

17:09.792 --> 17:11.667
THE ALTERNATIVE MEANS
HAVING A LIFE,

17:11.709 --> 17:13.667
A REAL LIFE LIKE OTHER KIDS,

17:13.709 --> 17:16.417
EVEN IF IT'S JUST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.875
YOU KNOW, PLAYING OUTSIDE
AND MAYBE GOING SURFING AND...

17:18.917 --> 17:20.875
INSTEAD OF SPENDING HER LIFE...

17:20.917 --> 17:23.417
IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
WE HAVE DOWN THE HALL.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.125
IT MEANS
CELEBRATING HER BIRTHDAY

17:26.166 --> 17:27.875
SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN HERE.

17:27.917 --> 17:31.625
IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL
BE ABLE TO TREAT PEOPLE

17:31.667 --> 17:34.166
WITH ANNIE'S CONDITION
MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.333
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE PERSPECTIVE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT

17:36.375 --> 17:38.250
BECAUSE SHE'S STILL A KID.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.625
YOU CAN'T PUT A DECISION
LIKE THIS IN HER HANDS.
(man) IF THE SURGERY WORKS,

17:41.667 --> 17:44.083
WHAT WILL
HER QUALITY OF LIFE BE?
WELL, IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
SHE'LL BE LIMITED
IN HER ACTIVITIES.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.667
YOU'LL NEED TO
KEEP HER HOME MOSTLY.

17:48.709 --> 17:50.917
BUT WITH MEDICATIONS,
WE CAN SUSTAIN HER HEART.

17:50.959 --> 17:53.000
SHE'LL BE ALIVE.
FOR HOW LONG?

17:57.333 --> 17:59.792
(crying)
I WANT TO TAKE HER HOME.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.875
(sobbing)

18:12.750 --> 18:14.750
HI.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.041
OKAY.

18:18.083 --> 18:21.125
WAIT. YOU'RE THE ONE
FROM THE SCRUB ROOM.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.917
I DIDN'T REALIZE
'CAUSE OF THE HAIR.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.959
I HAD THIS IMAGE OF IT
IN MY HEAD,

18:26.041 --> 18:29.291
YOU KNOW, UNDER THE CAP,
AND...
OH, YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.750
OKAY. (laughs)

18:31.792 --> 18:34.041
BUT RED. RED IS GOOD.
RED BECOMES YOU.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.125
THANK YOU.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.917
(laughs) LOOK, I'M SORRY.

18:37.959 --> 18:38.917
(laughs)

18:38.959 --> 18:40.917
I AM--
I AM HAVING A DAY.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.834
I-I GOT SOME BAD NEWS,

18:42.875 --> 18:44.834
AND THEN I'VE GOT
THIS PATIENT--

18:44.875 --> 18:47.917
ANOTHER DOCTOR HAS CONVINCED
HER PARENTS TO LET HER DIE,

18:47.959 --> 18:50.917
WHICH I THINK--I KNOW--
IS THE WRONG DECISION.

18:50.959 --> 18:54.458
ANYWAY, IT'S A--WHEW--
A DAY.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.041
YOU EVER DO THAT? YOU EVER
WORRY OVER A PATIENT?

18:58.083 --> 18:59.667
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

18:59.709 --> 19:02.667
I'M WORRYING OVER THIS
PREGNANT WOMAN RIGHT NOW.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.083
HMM.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.875
UM, CHARLOTTE KING.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.375
IS THAT YOUR NAME?

19:07.417 --> 19:08.875
OH, NO, NO. (laughs)

19:08.917 --> 19:11.291
NO, SHE'S, UM,
THE CHIEF OF STAFF HERE.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.875
RIGHT. I KNEW THAT.
I... (chuckles)

19:13.917 --> 19:15.083
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HER.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.083
UH, IF YOU BELIEVE
YOUR PATIENT SHOULD LIVE,

19:17.125 --> 19:19.792
THEN YOU SHOULD
FIGHT FOR IT.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.792
AND CHARLOTTE--I MEAN,
WELL, SHE'S CHARLOTTE,

19:21.834 --> 19:24.041
BUT SHE--
SHE'LL HELP YOU FIGHT.
THANK YOU.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.625
NO PROBLEM.

19:28.083 --> 19:32.083
WELL, I SHOULD,
UM, UM, GO...

19:32.125 --> 19:34.041
OH.
SEE CHARLOTTE.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.583
RIGHT, OF COURSE.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.000
(chuckles)

19:47.000 --> 19:48.959
IF YOU SEE THE MAN
WHO ASSAULTED YOU,

19:49.041 --> 19:51.583
PLEASE IDENTIFY HIM BY STATING
ALOUD HIS REFERENCE NUMBER.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.000
TAKE AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU NEED.

20:06.709 --> 20:07.750
5.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.667
YOU'VE INDICATED
SUSPECT NUMBER 5.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.625
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
THE MAN WHO ATTACKED YOU?

20:12.667 --> 20:14.041
YES, I'M SURE. 5.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.709
ALL RIGHT, MISS AVERY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.208
YOU DID IT, JILL.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.375
THE FACE...

20:25.417 --> 20:28.041
S-SEEING IT AGAIN, IT'S--

20:28.083 --> 20:31.083
IT'S OKAY.
HE CAN'T HURT YOU ANYMORE.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.041
I-I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ME
REMEMBER WHAT HE DID TO ME.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.875
BUT IT... IT'S JUST...

20:37.917 --> 20:40.917
I'M SCARED.
I'M REALLY SCARED.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.917
(sighs) I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S COMING OUT.

20:46.959 --> 20:50.208
I'M GONNA GET TO GO IN THE WATER
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, EVER.

20:50.250 --> 20:54.041
DR. FREEDMAN,
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A SEC?

20:54.083 --> 20:56.041
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:56.083 --> 20:58.000
JUST GIVE US A SEC.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.959
CATHETER IS NOT
COMING OUT TODAY.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.959
WHAT?
DR. BARNES APPROACHED ME.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.875
HE FEELS
HE CAN SAVE ANNIE'S LIFE

21:06.917 --> 21:09.458
AND THAT YOU'RE LETTING
A MINOR MAKE A DECISION

21:09.500 --> 21:11.917
ABOUT REFUSING TREATMENT.
THE FAMILY AND I CONCUR
ON THIS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:11.959 --> 21:14.917
HE HAS A VALID CLAIM.
HE'S GOING FOR A COURT ORDER.
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
LIKE THAT?

21:14.959 --> 21:16.917
LIKE WHAT?
LIKE I'M SOME STRANGER.

21:16.959 --> 21:18.917
I COULD'VE LET HIM
SANDBAG YOU. I DIDN'T.

21:18.959 --> 21:21.875
I'M GIVING YOU A HEADS-UP.
OKAY, STILL LIKE A STRANGER,
CHARLOTTE, AND YOU KNOW ME.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.041
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE
DOING THIS FOR HER

21:24.083 --> 21:26.041
IF I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RIGHT. COME ON.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.959
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.333
THERE WAS DEFINITELY FLIRTING.
WITH THE SURGEON?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.291
UH-HUH.
(singsong voice) CUTE SURGEON.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.709
(singsong voice)
CUTE SURGEON.

21:40.750 --> 21:44.375
(normal voice) IT FELT... GOOD
TO FEEL LIKE ME AGAIN.

21:44.417 --> 21:47.917
HEY, UH, CAN I STEAL SOME OF
THOSE COLORED PAPER CLIPS?

21:47.959 --> 21:50.792
ON YOUR DESK? FOR AN ART PROJECT
THAT BETSEY'S DOING?

21:50.834 --> 21:52.709
(Addison)
SHE'S IN A TRANCE.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.709
OH.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.041
(sighs)

21:55.083 --> 21:56.959
HMM.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.250
OH, RESORT PORN.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.834
YES. LOOK, YOU CAN--

22:00.875 --> 22:03.667
YOU CAN WATCH WHALES BREACH,
JUST RIGHT FROM YOUR PALAPA.

22:03.709 --> 22:05.667
OOH.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING?

22:05.709 --> 22:07.709
OH, NO, NO,
THIS ISN'T FOR ME.

22:07.750 --> 22:11.709
THIS IS FOR SAM
AND, UH... SONYA.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.917
YOU'RE PLANNING A TRIP

22:13.959 --> 22:17.000
FOR YOUR EX-HUSBAND
AND HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

22:17.041 --> 22:20.041
YOU REALIZE HOW WEIRD
THAT SOUNDS?

22:20.083 --> 22:23.041
YEAH, OF COURSE I DO.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.041
IT'S JU--LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

22:25.083 --> 22:29.959
I MEAN, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE
ENJOYING IT.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.542
(lowered voice) WITHOUT
THE SURGERY, ANNIE DIES.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.834
WITHOUT THE SURGERY,
ANNIE HAS A LIFE,

22:34.875 --> 22:37.041
AT LEAST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF PRECEDENTS

22:37.083 --> 22:39.542
THAT DEAL WITH THE DENIAL OF
MEDICAL TREATMENT TO CHILDREN,

22:39.583 --> 22:41.041
BUT THEY PRIMARILY INVOLVE

22:41.083 --> 22:43.417
THE RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
OF THE PARENTS.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.417
THIS ISN'T A RELIGIOUS THING,
JUDGE.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.750
IT'S ABOUT GIVING
OUR LITTLE GIRL

22:47.792 --> 22:49.375
WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS.

22:49.417 --> 22:51.792
LOOK, THIS IS AS PAINFUL
A DECISION AS ANYONE CAN FACE.

22:51.834 --> 22:55.000
I UNDERSTAND WHY THE BISHOPS
DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT.

22:55.041 --> 22:58.333
BUT BY GIVING IN
TO WHAT THEIR CHILD WANTS...
AND SHE IS A CHILD.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.750
THEY ARE ABDICATING
THEIR PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

23:00.792 --> 23:04.250
DO I GET A SAY HERE?
I'M SORRY, ANNIE,
BUT YOU DON'T.

23:04.291 --> 23:05.792
BUT IT'S MY LIFE.

23:05.834 --> 23:07.792
YES, BUT LEGALLY,
YOUR PARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE

23:07.834 --> 23:10.583
FOR MAKING DECISIONS
ABOUT YOUR MEDICAL CARE.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.583
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT STATE LAW PROHIBITS YOU

23:13.625 --> 23:16.041
FROM ACTING IN ANY WAY
THAT ENDANGERS ANNIE'S HEALTH.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.834
YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE THEM TO
MAKE ANNIE UNDERGO THE SURGERY?

23:18.875 --> 23:21.250
THAT CATHETER STAYS IN,
AND THE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED

23:21.291 --> 23:25.041
FOR THE FIRST AVAILABLE DATE.
(crying) THAT'S NOT FAIR.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.834
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

23:35.542 --> 23:37.000
HEY, STRANGER.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.041
(chuckles) HEY.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.041
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

23:41.083 --> 23:43.041
YEAH, I LIGHTENED
MY SURGICAL SCHEDULE.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.875
I HAD SOME PERSONAL STUFF.

23:44.917 --> 23:47.208
OH.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.041
FINISHING OR STARTING?

23:49.083 --> 23:51.041
STARTING? YOU.
ME, TOO.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.041
(chuckles)

23:53.083 --> 23:55.041
(chuckles)

23:55.083 --> 23:57.834
I MISSED YOU.
I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT.

23:57.875 --> 24:00.500
BUT I DID...

24:00.542 --> 24:02.750
MISS YOU.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.834
WHY...
SHOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT?

24:05.875 --> 24:08.959
I JUST, UM...

24:09.000 --> 24:11.667
I DON'T KNOW.
(pedal clunks, water splashes)

24:11.709 --> 24:14.917
UM, I-I SHOULD GO, UH,
BACK IN THERE

24:14.959 --> 24:18.041
BEFORE THE BABY COMES OUT
WITHOUT ME

24:18.083 --> 24:20.000
AND... I GET SUED.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.083
OKAY.

24:21.125 --> 24:24.000
OKAY.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.166
(sighs)

24:28.208 --> 24:31.041
STILL NOTHING.
ONLY HIS FACE.

24:31.083 --> 24:32.792
I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

24:32.834 --> 24:35.291
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
TESTIFY AGAINST HIM

24:35.333 --> 24:38.041
IF I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

24:38.083 --> 24:40.041
WELL, THE TRIAL
IS A MONTH AWAY, JILL.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.125
YOU HAVE TIME.
YOU'LL REMEMBER.
AND THEN WHAT?

24:42.166 --> 24:44.333
I CAN SEE WHAT HE DID TO ME
AGAIN AND AGAIN?

24:44.375 --> 24:47.041
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
ALL I SEE IS HIS FACE,

24:47.083 --> 24:48.333
AND I SEE IT EVERYWHERE--

24:48.375 --> 24:50.959
AT THE STORE, ON THE BOY
WHO PACKS MY GROCERIES,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.709
AT THE GYM,
EVERY GUY IN THE CORRIDOR.

24:54.750 --> 24:57.375
EVERY TIME I GO ANYWHERE,

24:57.417 --> 24:59.375
I SEE HIM.

24:59.417 --> 25:03.375
AND AT NIGHT, IN MY DREAMS--
WE CAN STOP.

25:03.417 --> 25:06.375
WE CAN WORK ON HELPING YOU
COPE WITH WHERE YOU ARE TODAY.

25:06.417 --> 25:10.959
(crying) NO.
I WANT TO PUT HIM AWAY.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.041
(sighs)

25:12.083 --> 25:15.959
(normal voice)
I NEED THIS FEAR TO GO AWAY.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.041
OKAY, I'M GONNA
INSERT THE NEEDLE NOW.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.083
YOU MIGHT FEEL
A SLIGHT PINCH.
WAIT, WAIT,
BEFORE YOU DO IT,

25:23.125 --> 25:26.041
I JUST NEED FOR YOU
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING,

25:26.083 --> 25:28.875
JUST TO GET
MY MIND OFF THIS.

25:28.917 --> 25:31.792
OKAY, UH, LET'S SEE.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT...

25:31.834 --> 25:34.792
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T HAVING SEX.
(laughs)

25:34.834 --> 25:37.041
WHY NOT? YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,
SUCCESSFUL...

25:37.083 --> 25:39.166
YEAH, WELL...

25:39.208 --> 25:41.375
I'M KIND OF
IN BETWEEN GUYS RIGHT NOW.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.959
ANYBODY YOU GOT YOUR EYE ON?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.041
THERE IS... THIS ONE GUY.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.000
CUTE?
VERY.

25:48.041 --> 25:49.667
DETAILS.
(laughs)

25:49.709 --> 25:51.667
I'M ON BED REST
AND BEING DENIED SEX.

25:51.709 --> 25:55.041
I NEED SOME DETAILS.
WELL... HE'S A GOOD GUY.

25:55.083 --> 25:58.041
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HIM
THAT WELL OR ANYTHING,

25:58.083 --> 26:00.041
BUT YOU CAN JUST TELL,
YOU KNOW?

26:00.083 --> 26:03.041
HE'S A GOOD GUY,
AND I NEED A GOOD GUY.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.250
ANY DATES?
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

26:05.291 --> 26:07.041
I MEAN, HE'S...

26:07.083 --> 26:09.875
IT'S LIKE
HE WANTS TO ASK ME OUT,

26:09.917 --> 26:11.083
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.250
IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
HOLDING HIM BACK OR...

26:13.291 --> 26:15.041
WELL, GO AFTER HIM.
(giggles)

26:15.083 --> 26:17.875
GET YOURS.
(laughs)

26:17.917 --> 26:20.250
AND THEN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.
OKAY.

26:20.291 --> 26:23.917
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,
YOU WILL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.291
(knock on doorjamb)

26:30.083 --> 26:32.041
I HEAR THE WAVES ARE
2 TO 4 FEET,

26:32.083 --> 26:34.917
GREAT SHAPE.

26:34.959 --> 26:37.458
ONE OF THE GUYS
IN THE OFFICE SURFS.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.041
SAID IT WAS GREAT
OUT THERE TODAY.

26:40.083 --> 26:43.041
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.041
CAN'T SEE IT FROM HERE.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.750
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.125
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT
ONE DAY,

26:52.166 --> 26:54.125
I COULD BE OUT THERE
DOING IT MYSELF,

26:54.166 --> 26:56.125
IT WAS FUN TO THINK ABOUT.

26:56.166 --> 26:59.083
BUT NOW...
COME ON, ANNIE.

26:59.125 --> 27:01.500
WE BOTH KNOW THE TRUTH.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.875
I'M GONNA DIE
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.291
YOU SIGNED OFF
ON THE INJUNCTION.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.875
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU JUST
WANT ME TO LET HER DIE?

27:12.917 --> 27:14.875
I WAS DOING MY JOB.
I WAS FOLLOWING THE LAW.

27:14.917 --> 27:16.333
BUT?
MAYBE COOPER'S RIGHT.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.792
KEEPING HER ALIVE ISN'T
THE SAME AS SAVING HER LIFE.

27:18.834 --> 27:22.041
LOOK, I AM SORRY ANNIE CAN'T GO
TO SCHOOL OR GO SURFING,

27:22.083 --> 27:24.542
BUT IS THE CHANCE TO DO THAT
FOR A MONTH OR TWO,

27:24.583 --> 27:29.041
IS THAT WORTH GIVING UP
THE CHANCE AT LIVING PAST 13?
SHE'S GOT NOTHING LEFT
IN HER, NOAH,

27:29.083 --> 27:31.917
NOT EVEN
THE WILL TO FIGHT YOU.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.959
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF,

27:34.000 --> 27:36.792
WHO ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR?

27:38.834 --> 27:41.041
SHE STILL HASN'T DONE
THE AMNIO.

27:41.083 --> 27:44.041
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST DO THAT
CHARM THING YOU PEOPLE DO.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.834
YOU'RE CHARMING.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.250
(chuckles)

27:50.041 --> 27:52.500
LOOK, I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

27:52.542 --> 27:54.792
IN PSYCHOLOGICAL CIRCLES,
WE CALL THAT A STALL.

27:54.834 --> 27:57.041
UH, HEY, JILL HAD
A VERY TOUGH SESSION TODAY.

27:57.083 --> 28:01.000
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
DO SOMETHING TO HELP HER RELAX.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.625
(breathes heavily)
HEY, JILL.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.625
(panting)

28:08.667 --> 28:10.083
JILL.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.166
DON'T TOUCH ME!

28:11.208 --> 28:13.709
(gasping)

28:13.750 --> 28:16.250
JILL, IT'S ME. IT'S PETE.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.875
FOCUS ON ME. LOOK AT ME.
IT'S PETE.

28:18.917 --> 28:20.250
OKAY.
OKAY?

28:20.291 --> 28:22.041
(breathes heavily)

28:22.083 --> 28:26.041
OKAY, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE OKAY.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.041
SHE'S RESTING.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.667
THANKS.

28:39.709 --> 28:41.750
VIOLET, YOU HAVE TO STOP.

28:41.792 --> 28:44.208
SHE'S TRAUMATIZED.
BY THE ATTACK.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.041
SHE--SHE'S AFRAID THAT IF SHE
DOESN'T FINISH WHAT SHE STARTED,

28:47.083 --> 28:49.041
THEN THIS THING
WILL KEEP HAUNTING HER.

28:49.083 --> 28:52.375
SO I'M--I'M GONNA
SUPPORT HER IN THAT.
JILL IS A WRECK.
SHE'S FALLING APART.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.583
SHE WAS HAPPY.
SHE HAD A LIFE.

28:54.625 --> 28:57.041
HE CAME IN AND--AND TOOK
A PIECE OF IT AWAY--

28:57.083 --> 28:58.875
HER CONTENTMENT, HER SECURITY.

28:58.917 --> 29:00.959
AND UNTIL SHE SEES THIS GUY

29:01.000 --> 29:02.875
LOCKED UP
AND PAYING FOR WHAT HE DID,

29:02.917 --> 29:04.875
SHE'S NOT GONNA
MOVE PAST IT.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.500
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.667
HEY.

29:16.709 --> 29:19.041
HEY.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.792
YOU'RE HERE LATE.

29:20.834 --> 29:23.834
YEAH, WELL... YOU KNOW,
BABIES DON'T TELL TIME.

29:23.875 --> 29:26.041
(chuckles)

29:26.083 --> 29:29.625
BESIDES, YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE HERE, TOO.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.625
DO YOU THINK WE PUSH?

29:31.667 --> 29:33.208
AS, UM, DOCTORS,

29:33.250 --> 29:35.125
DO YOU THINK
WE PUSH TOO HARD?

29:35.166 --> 29:39.041
(exhales deeply)

29:39.083 --> 29:40.291
I DON'T KNOW.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.875
I MEAN... WELL, I HAVE
THIS PATIENT NOW.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.875
SHE'S PREGNANT AND JUST...

29:45.917 --> 29:47.875
JUST TRYING
TO GET HER THROUGH IT

29:47.917 --> 29:50.542
SO SHE CAN HAVE
A HEALTHY BABY, I PUSH,

29:50.583 --> 29:52.542
YOU KNOW,
FOR PATIENTS LIKE HER,

29:52.583 --> 29:54.041
BECAUSE SHE NEEDS ME TO.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.083
WHAT ABOUT
WHEN THEY DON'T NEED YOU TO?

29:56.125 --> 29:58.875
ARE YOU OKAY?

29:58.917 --> 30:02.041
I THINK I'VE BEEN PUSHING
TOO HARD.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.792
I DON'T KNOW.

30:03.834 --> 30:06.000
JUST...

30:07.917 --> 30:10.083
♪♪

30:10.125 --> 30:11.917
JUST, UM,

30:11.959 --> 30:15.083
JUST SIT HERE WITH ME?

30:15.125 --> 30:17.208
OKAY.

30:23.417 --> 30:24.875
DO YOU REALIZE

30:24.917 --> 30:27.375
THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
EACH OTHER'S NAMES?
