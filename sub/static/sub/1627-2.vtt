NARRATOR: There is a town in Maine...

00:03.212 --> 00:04.167
I'd like a room.

00:04.255 --> 00:05.335
GRANNY: Welcome to Storybrooke.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.419
...where every storybook
character youâ€™ve ever known...

00:08.509 --> 00:11.421
-(GASPS)
-...is trapped between two worlds.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.595
An evil queen sent a bunch
of fairy tale characters here?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.593
And now they don't remember
who they are.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.345
NARRATOR:
Victims of a powerful curse...

00:18.436 --> 00:19.516
Everything you love,

00:19.604 --> 00:21.265
everything all of you love,

00:21.355 --> 00:22.765
will be taken from you.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.690
...that can only be
broken by one person.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.765
It's your destiny.

00:26.861 --> 00:27.941
You're gonna bring back
the happy endings.

00:28.654 --> 00:29.769
You enjoy your stay.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.756
The missing pages. Where are they?

02:16.762 --> 02:19.879
It's an old book. Stuff's missing.
What do you care?

02:19.974 --> 02:22.010
I care because you think
I'm some Evil Queen.

02:23.019 --> 02:26.011
And that hurts me, Henry.
I'm your mother.

02:26.105 --> 02:27.390
No, you're not.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.097
Well, then who is?

02:30.609 --> 02:31.815
That woman you brought here?

02:32.862 --> 02:35.399
I don't like what she or this book
is doing to you.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.987
Thankfully, both are no longer an issue.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.234
What?

(BELL CHIMING)

03:00.639 --> 03:02.425
Hey, how about that?

03:02.767 --> 03:05.383
Guess those rusty old innards finally
straightened themselves out, huh?

03:10.983 --> 03:13.190
Yes. How about that, indeed.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.357
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

03:19.116 --> 03:21.607
Did you know the honey crisp tree
is the most vigorous

03:21.702 --> 03:23.112
and hardy of all apple trees?

03:24.872 --> 03:28.706
It can survive temperatures as low
as 40 below and keep growing.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.283
It can weather any storm.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.879
l have one that I've tended to
since I was a little girl.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.956
And to this day,

03:37.051 --> 03:41.135
l have yet to taste anything more
delicious than the fruit it offers.

03:42.515 --> 03:43.630
Thanks.

03:43.849 --> 03:45.760
I'm sure you'll enjoy them
on your drive home.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.387
Actually, I'm gonna stay for a while.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.386
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.564
Henry has enough issues.
He doesn't need you confusing him.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.061
All due respect, Madame Mayor,

03:55.152 --> 03:57.894
the fact that you have now threatened
me twice in the last 12 hours

03:57.988 --> 03:58.977
makes me want to stay more.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.647
Since when were apples a threat?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.151
I can read between the lines.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.450
Sorry. ljust want to make sure
Henry's okay.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.119
He's fine, dear.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.781
Any problems he has
are being taken care of.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.081
What does that mean?

04:11.836 --> 04:13.497
It means I have him in therapy.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.327
It's all under control.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.381
Take my advice, Miss Swan, only one
of us knows what's best for Henry.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.921
Yeah. I'm starting to think
you're right about that.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.510
It's time for you to go.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.586
Or what?

04:25.850 --> 04:27.966
Don't underestimate me, Miss Swan.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.353
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.476
I shall destroy your happiness

04:41.073 --> 04:43.029
if it is the last thing I do.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.318
Hey!

04:48.038 --> 04:49.027
(GRUNTS)

04:59.717 --> 05:02.003
Would you like something to drink?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.380
Do I look like I need a drink?

05:05.014 --> 05:07.130
l was only trying to help.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.216
Thank you.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.935
Now that was an awfully big threat.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.972
Destroy everyone's happiness?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.766
How do you plan
on accomplishing that?

05:19.528 --> 05:20.859
The Dark Curse.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.313
Are you sure, Your Majesty?

05:24.408 --> 05:25.693
But you said you'd never use it.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.320
You made a deal
when you gave away that curse.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.400
You traded it away.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.531
She won't be happy to see you.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.490
Since when do I care about
anyone else's happiness but mine?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.577
Prepare the carriage.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.087
We're going to the Forbidden Fortress.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.422
MALEFICENT: How are you, dear?

05:50.267 --> 05:51.768
QUEEN: I'm doing fine.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.262
Are you?

05:53.771 --> 05:56.604
If it were me, I'd be simply tortured,

05:56.774 --> 05:59.356
watching that flake of Snow so happy.

06:00.069 --> 06:03.186
Weren't you about the same age
when you were to be married

06:03.280 --> 06:04.736
before she ruined it all?

06:04.823 --> 06:06.074
Yes, you were.

06:06.158 --> 06:09.116
Yes, it was about
the same age you were

06:09.787 --> 06:12.699
when that Sleeping Beauty
got the best of you,

06:12.790 --> 06:14.451
my dear Maleficent.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.158
l soldiered on. As you will, too.

06:17.253 --> 06:18.242
Hopefully.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.747
Enough games.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.290
You know why I'm here.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.216
I need my curse back.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.373
It's not yours anymore.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.209
A deal's a deal.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.214
I traded you my sleeping curse.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.513
Which failed. Undone by a simple kiss.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.306
Now please, return what's mine.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.100
The Dark Curse? Really?

06:35.312 --> 06:37.803
You must know that not even
its unholy power

06:37.940 --> 06:39.646
can bring your loved one
back from the dead.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.483
Have you considered a pet?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.238
They can be quite comforting.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.741
The only comfort for me
is Snow White's suffering.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.662
Well, it's her wedding night,
I doubt she's suffering right now.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.156
I need that curse.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.918
I know you keep it hidden
in the orb above your staff.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.246
Hidden for the good of all, old friend.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.174
Whoever created that monstrosity
makes the two of us look positively

07:07.761 --> 07:08.750

07:10.347 --> 07:12.178
Who did give it to you?

07:13.559 --> 07:16.266
Where I got it is none of your concern.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.809
(RUMBLING)

07:17.896 --> 07:19.511

Love is weakness, Maleficent.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.350
I thought you knew that.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.646
If you're going to kill me, kill me.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.728
Why would I do that?

08:10.449 --> 08:12.314
You're my only friend.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.533
Don't do this.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.985
This curse.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.533
There are lines
even we shouldn't cross.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.949
All power comes with a price.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.745
Enacting it will take a terrible toll.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.289
It will leave an emptiness inside you.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.754
A void you will never be able to fill.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.257
So be it.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.899
Who among us is tired of losing?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.112
That's why I called you here.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.990
To put an end to our misery.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.029
Today we claim victory.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.578
And move to a new, better realm.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.287
A place where we can finally win.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.456
And we'll be happy?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.291
I guarantee it.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.466
But first, I need something from you.

09:17.266 --> 09:21.054
A lock of hair from those
with the darkest souls.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.310
You must trust me.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.229
Because if you don't,

09:26.984 --> 09:28.940
there are other ways.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.670
A wise decision.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.929
All that remains is the final ingredient.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.688
A prized heart.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.232
From my childhood steed.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.492
The glorious beast whose passing
will fuel our victory.

to bring you the latest edition.

I assure you,
it's one of my better hatchetjobs.

That's not what I asked for.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.688
What did you find out about her?

11:31.775 --> 11:34.061
Well, the truth be told,
there wasn't much.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.112
She spent a lot of time in foster homes.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.567
She got into some trouble
when she was a kid,

11:39.658 --> 11:41.068
but the details are
locked up pretty tight.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.733
Since then, she's clean.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.284
Bounced around all over.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.454
The only thing I really learned was
that she doesn't like to sit still.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.207
That appears to have changed.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.254
Did you know that she had Henry
while she was in Phoenix?

11:55.757 --> 11:57.372
How'd he wind up here in Maine?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.083
So, if I'm understanding you correctly,

12:00.178 --> 12:01.759
you found nothing of value.

Which means you have
no value, Sidney.

Do you know what I do
with things that hold no value to me?

12:08.145 --> 12:09.601
I throw them away.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.553
(STAMMERING) I'll keep looking.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.065
Thank you, but I did not order that.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.572
Yeah, I know. You have an admirer.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.249
Ah, so you decided to stay?

12:33.337 --> 12:35.419
Observant. Important for a cop.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.666
It's good news for our tourist business.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.669
It's bad for our local signage.

12:42.638 --> 12:43.673
It's a joke.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.430
Because you ran over our sign.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.257
Look. The cocoa was a nice gesture.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.719
And I am impressed that you guessed
that I like cinnamon on my chocolate

'cause most people don't,

12:52.981 --> 12:54.972

So thank you but no thank you.

with you and your mom?

13:12.501 --> 13:15.709
It's not about us, it's about her curse.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.247
We have to break it.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.954
Luckily, I have a plan.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.131
Step one, identification.

13:21.218 --> 13:23.300
I call it Operation Cobra.

13:23.512 --> 13:24.547
Cobra?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.344
That has nothing to do with fairy tales.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.012
Exactly. It's a codename.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.718
To throw the Queen off the trail.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.601
So everyone here is a fairy tale
character, theyjust don't know it?

13:33.730 --> 13:34.765
That's the curse.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.689
Time's been frozen. Until you got here.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.100
Hey!

13:40.195 --> 13:41.310
Where'd you get that?

13:41.738 --> 13:42.773
Your mom.

13:42.864 --> 13:43.990
Don't eat that.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.564
Okay.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.443
Uh, all right. What about their pasts?

13:49.538 --> 13:51.529
They don't know. It's a haze to them.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.661
Ask anyone anything and you'll see.

13:54.751 --> 13:58.164
So, for decades people have been
walking around in a haze

13:58.296 --> 14:00.457
not aging, with screwed-up memories,

14:03.218 --> 14:04.253
I knew you'd get it.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.175
That's why we need you.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.128
You're the only one
who can stop her curse.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.347
Because I'm the daughter of
Snow White and Prince Charming?

14:10.434 --> 14:13.346
Yes.
And right now we have the advantage.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.348
My mom doesn't know that.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.724
I took out the end.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.225
The part with you in it.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.274
See? Your mom is Snow White.

14:21.820 --> 14:22.809
Oh, kid.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.528
I know the hero never believes at first.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.527
If they did,
it wouldn't be a very good story.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.781
If you need proof, take them.
Read them.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.330
But whatever you do,
don't let her see these pages.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.954
They're dangerous.
If she finds out who you are...

14:39.504 --> 14:40.914
It would be bad.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.586
I gotta go.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.793
But I'll find you later
and we can get started.

14:48.764 --> 14:49.970
I knew you'd believe me.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.387
I never said I did.

Why else would you be here?

14:58.482 --> 15:00.018
It's good to see his smile back.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.188
I didn't do anything.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.436
You stayed.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.143
So, does the Mayor know
you're still here?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.774
Oh, she knows.

15:06.865 --> 15:07.900
What is her deal?

15:07.991 --> 15:10.528
She is not a great people person.
How did she get elected?

15:10.619 --> 15:12.450
She's been Mayor
as long as I can remember.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.824
No one's ever been brave enough
to run against her.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.156
She inspires quite a bit of,

15:17.667 --> 15:19.043
well, fear.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.543
I'm afraid I only made that worse
by giving Henry that book.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.495
Now he thinks she's the Evil Queen.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.163
Who does he think you are?

15:26.551 --> 15:27.540
It's silly.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.173
I just got five minutes of silly.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.854
I'm not in the book.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.478
Can I ask you a favor?

15:44.569 --> 15:47.356
Regina mentioned the kid's in therapy.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.863
Do you know where
I could find the doctor?

I was just reading about you.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.286

with a little post-traumatic stress?

-That diagnosis was free, by the way.

-I know. I'm sorry, ljust...

16:10.303 --> 16:11.634
Just tell me something.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.712
This fairy tale obsession.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.172
What is causing it?

16:15.267 --> 16:19.101
I mean, he thinks everyone is
a character in his book. That's

16:20.230 --> 16:21.219
crazy.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.143
I hope you don't talk that way
in front of him.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.397
The word "crazy" is quite damaging.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.863
These stories.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.942
They're his language.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.069
He has no idea
how to express complex emotions

16:34.161 --> 16:35.776
so he's translating as best he can.

16:35.871 --> 16:36.951
This is how he communicates.

16:37.038 --> 16:40.656
He's using this book
to help deal with his problems.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.207
But he got the book a month ago.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.879
Has he been seeing you
longer than that?

16:45.630 --> 16:47.916
Um, yes, he has.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.794
So it's Regina, isn't it?

16:50.010 --> 16:54.094
His mother is
a very complicated woman.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.258
Over the years, her attempts to try and
bring Henry closer have only backfired.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.691
Why don't you take a look at the file.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.275
Um, you'll see what I mean.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.865
Why are you doing this?

17:16.077 --> 17:18.238
He talks about you a lot.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.120
You're very important to him.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.327
Thank you.

Miss Swan?

17:32.677 --> 17:34.463
For the sake of the boy,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.512
be careful how you handle
his belief system.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.890
Destroying his imagination would be

17:41.228 --> 17:42.388
devastating.

Yes.

How did you know
she was gonna come here?

Actually, I'm here
about Dr. Archibald Hopper.

He mentioned you got into
a bit of a row with him earlier.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.606
No.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.108
I was shocked, too.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.190
Given your shy, delicate sensibilities.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.859
He says you demanded
to see Henry's files

18:40.954 --> 18:43.821
and when he refused
you came back and stole them.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.200
He gave them to me.

Alas, he's telling a different tale.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.062
Or because she was set up.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.023
And if she was,
that means Dr. Hopper was lying.

27:37.114 --> 27:40.072
And if he's lying
that means someone asked him to.

27:40.743 --> 27:42.654
Are we really confident
that the man's conscience

27:42.745 --> 27:43.905
won't eventually get the best of him?

27:43.996 --> 27:46.863
I think your schoolboy crush
is clouding yourjudgment.

27:48.042 --> 27:50.658
Remember, I made you sheriff

27:51.087 --> 27:53.248
and I can take it awayjust as easily.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.079
You want me to arrest her again? I will.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.163
Good.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.833
But she's gonna keep coming at you.

27:58.928 --> 28:00.509
And I know you,
you're going to keep coming at her.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.178
And you will do whatever it takes to get
her out of here, and you may succeed.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.676
No. I will succeed.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.850
He's my son. It's what's best for him.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.097
I know that's what you believe,

28:09.605 --> 28:11.186
but if this escalates,

28:11.274 --> 28:14.016
it seems to me the only one
who will get hurt is Henry.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.946
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

28:30.960 --> 28:31.995
Yeah?

28:32.086 --> 28:35.123
REGINA: Miss Swan, Iâ€™d be happy
to continue demonstrating my power,

28:36.007 --> 28:38.749
but am I right in guessing
your resolve to stay is only growing?

28:38.843 --> 28:40.333
You have no idea.

28:40.428 --> 28:42.965
Well, then,
/ think itâ€™s time we made peace.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.962
Why don't you drive over to my office?

28:46.100 --> 28:48.307
Or walk. Whatever suits you.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.644
I'd like to start by apologizing,

28:56.277 --> 28:57.562
Miss Swan.

28:58.529 --> 28:59.564
What?

29:01.741 --> 29:04.232
I just have to accept the reality
that you want to be here.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.399
That's right, I do.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.075
And that you're here
to take my son from me.

29:07.163 --> 29:09.074
Okay. Let's be clear.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.451
I have no intention
of taking him from anyone.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.336
Well, then, what are you doing here?

29:14.629 --> 29:17.086
I know I'm not a mother.
I think that's pretty self-evident.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.128
But I did have him.

29:18.215 --> 29:21.799
And I can't help it, he got in my head,
and I want to make sure he's okay.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.210
And the more you try to push me out,
the more I want to be here,

29:24.305 --> 29:26.296
especially after seeing
how troubled he is.

29:26.641 --> 29:27.801
You think he's troubled?

29:28.017 --> 29:29.097
Well, he's in therapy.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.301
And I only got through a couple of
pages of his shrink's notes

29:31.437 --> 29:34.304
before you had me arrested.
But putting all that aside,

29:35.149 --> 29:38.437
he thinks everyone in this town
is a fairy tale character.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.516
And you don't?

29:39.654 --> 29:41.019
How can I?

29:41.864 --> 29:44.697
That poor kid can't tell the difference
between fantasy and reality

29:44.784 --> 29:46.695
and it's only getting worse.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.242
It's crazy.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.285
You think I'm crazy?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.242
Henry...

29:59.674 --> 30:01.790
How long was he there?

30:01.884 --> 30:03.385
Long enough.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.549
You knew he would be here.

30:08.432 --> 30:10.263
Did I know that my son
comes to my office

30:10.351 --> 30:12.307
every Thursday at precisely 5:00 pm.

30:12.395 --> 30:15.307
so I can take him for dinner
before his therapy session?

30:16.357 --> 30:18.063
Of course I did.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.562
I'm his mother.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.319
Your move.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.575
You have no soul.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.995
How in the hell did you get like this?

30:43.718 --> 30:44.833
What happened?

30:44.927 --> 30:46.667
Did you get your answer?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.052
What's going on?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.302
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

30:56.188 --> 30:58.895
Did Rumplestiltskin tell you
what you needed to know?

30:58.983 --> 31:00.018
Yes.

31:00.109 --> 31:01.315
And?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.484
I'm not sure I should say.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.070
I'm conflicted.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.942
How bad is it?

31:11.454 --> 31:13.240
Maybe I can help.

31:16.292 --> 31:19.705
I have to cut out the heart
of the thing I love most.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.289
Me.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.475
Daddy, I don't know what to do.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.606
My dear.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.022
Please.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.938
You don't have to do this.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.898
I have to do something.

31:46.989 --> 31:48.695
Then move past this.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.862
I know this may sound self-serving,

31:51.952 --> 31:53.738
but you don't need to enact the curse.

31:53.829 --> 31:56.320
But I can't keep living like this.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.450
What Snow did to me,
what she took from me...

32:02.338 --> 32:04.499
It's eating me alive, Daddy.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.794
Her very existence mocks me.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.253
She must be punished.

32:15.017 --> 32:18.180
If the price is a hole
that will never be filled,

32:18.270 --> 32:19.771
why do it?

32:20.064 --> 32:24.478
Stop worrying about Snow White
and start over.

32:25.319 --> 32:26.604
We can have a new life.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.689
But what kind of life?

32:28.781 --> 32:31.773
All I've worked for,
all I've built will be gone.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.320
My power will disappear.

32:34.829 --> 32:36.694
They already think I'm nothing.

32:36.789 --> 32:38.700
Power is seductive.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.039
But so is love.

32:41.836 --> 32:44.168
You can have that again.

32:56.976 --> 32:58.932
ljust want to be happy.

32:59.603 --> 33:00.809
You can be.

33:01.272 --> 33:02.853
Of this I'm sure.

33:04.066 --> 33:08.526
I believe if given the chance,
we can find happiness

33:09.029 --> 33:10.360
together.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.698
But the choice is yours.

33:20.124 --> 33:22.331
I think you're right. (SNIFFLES)

33:26.964 --> 33:28.500
I can be happy.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.505
Just not here.

33:33.762 --> 33:34.922
(SQUISHING)

33:42.855 --> 33:44.265
I'm sorry.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.439
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:00.706 --> 34:01.866
Hey.

34:04.168 --> 34:06.375
I just wanted to say thank you

34:07.087 --> 34:08.748
and pay you back the bail money.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.260
You look like you need to talk.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.229
Cinnamon?

34:27.816 --> 34:29.317
Oh, I'm sorry, I should've asked.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.653
It's a little quirk of mine. Do you mind?

34:32.071 --> 34:34.278
Not at all. No, thanks.

34:36.492 --> 34:39.905
When you bailed me out,
you said that you trusted me.

34:41.914 --> 34:42.949
VVhy?

34:44.333 --> 34:46.119
It's strange.
Ever since you arrived here,

34:46.210 --> 34:49.043
I've had the oddest feeling
like we met before.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.994
And I know it's crazy.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.624
I'm starting to reevaluate
my definition of crazy.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.255
For what it's worth,
I think you're innocent.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.385
Of breaking and entering
orjust in general?

34:59.848 --> 35:02.430
-Whichever makes you feel better.
-(CHUCKLES)

35:03.269 --> 35:07.182
It doesn't really matter what
anyone thinks I did or didn't do.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.396
I'm leaving.

35:10.484 --> 35:13.647
Thank you for everything,
but I think it's for the best.

35:13.737 --> 35:16.023
If I stay, Henry's only gonna
keep getting hurt.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.611
What happens if you go?

35:22.746 --> 35:27.285
I think the very fact that you want
to leave is why you have to stay.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.041
You care about him.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.294
Who will protect Henry if you won't?

35:42.975 --> 35:45.136
ARCHIE: Are you sure you don't want
to talk about it?

35:46.895 --> 35:50.353
You know, that umbrella is
kind of my good luck charm.

35:51.859 --> 35:53.395
Is that why you think I'm Jiminy Cricket?

35:54.611 --> 35:56.943
I don't think you're anyone.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.696
Miss Swan, I can explain.
The Mayor forced me to...

36:03.787 --> 36:05.994
I know. Don't worry about it. I get it.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.161
Henry, I'm sorry.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.489
I don't want to talk to you.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.664
Miss Swan, if she knew you were here...

36:12.338 --> 36:15.000
Henry, there is one simple reason
I stayed here.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.079
You.

36:16.175 --> 36:17.335
I wanted to get to know you.

36:17.426 --> 36:18.791
You think I'm crazy.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.093
No, I think the curse is crazy.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.545
And it is.

36:23.724 --> 36:24.930
(SIGHS)

36:25.642 --> 36:28.884
But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.

36:30.898 --> 36:33.890
It is a lot to ask anyone to believe in.

36:34.610 --> 36:38.102
But there are a lot of crazy things
in this world.

36:38.197 --> 36:41.030
So what do I know? Maybe it is true.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.697
But you told my mom...

36:42.785 --> 36:44.275
What she needed to hear.

36:45.829 --> 36:46.909
What I do know

36:48.582 --> 36:50.664
is that if the curse is real,

36:50.751 --> 36:52.287
the only way to break it

36:53.670 --> 36:55.626
is by tricking the Evil Queen

36:57.591 --> 37:00.754
into thinking that we are nonbelievers.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.385
'Cause that way, she's not on to us.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.845
Isn't that what Operation Cobra
was all about?

37:10.646 --> 37:12.307
Throwing her off the trail?

37:14.942 --> 37:15.931
Brilliant!

37:16.318 --> 37:17.558
I read the pages.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.314
And Henry, you were right.
They are dangerous.

37:19.822 --> 37:23.189
And there's only one way to make sure
that she never sees them.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.541
Now we have the advantage.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.095
(SIGHS)

37:44.179 --> 37:46.465
I knew you were here to help me.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.682
That's right, kid. I am.

37:52.813 --> 37:55.145
And nothing, not even a curse,

37:56.275 --> 37:57.390
is gonna stop that.

38:23.886 --> 38:25.547
(THUNDER CRASHING)

38:41.737 --> 38:43.227
(ANIMAL HOWLS)

38:59.004 --> 39:00.585
I love you, Daddy.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.063
What a mess.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.530
Not for long.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.110
What can I do for you, Mr. Gold?

39:33.205 --> 39:35.161
I was just in the neighborhood,
thought I'd pop by.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.782
-Lovely to see you in such high spirits.
-(LAUGHS)

39:39.795 --> 39:41.501
It's been a good day.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.705
I just rid the town
of an unwanted nuisance.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.835
Emma Swan?

39:46.468 --> 39:47.457
Really?

39:47.553 --> 39:48.542
Yes.

39:48.804 --> 39:50.795
I imagine she's halfway to Boston
by now.

39:52.808 --> 39:54.764
I wouldn't bet on that.

39:56.937 --> 40:00.725
I've just seen her strolling down
the main street with your boy.

40:00.816 --> 40:02.898
Thick as thieves they looked.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.100
What?

40:06.071 --> 40:08.187
Perhaps you should've come to me.

40:09.866 --> 40:12.824
If Miss Swan is a problem you can't fix,

40:12.953 --> 40:14.238
I'm only too happy to help.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.990
For a price, of course.

40:16.123 --> 40:18.114
(CHUCKLES)

40:18.208 --> 40:21.496
I'm not in the business of
making deals with you anymore.

40:23.839 --> 40:26.251
To which deal are you referring?

40:28.343 --> 40:29.799
You know what deal.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.592
Oh, right, yeah.

40:32.014 --> 40:34.255
The boy I procured for you.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.091
Henry.

40:38.353 --> 40:41.311
Did I ever tell you
what a lovely name that was?

40:42.858 --> 40:44.894
However did you pick it?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.191
Did you want her to come to town?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.448
You wanted all this to happen,
didn't you?

40:53.535 --> 40:55.696
Your finding Henry
wasn't an accident, was it?

40:55.787 --> 40:56.776
Whatever do you mean?

40:56.872 --> 40:58.703
Where did you get him?

41:00.292 --> 41:01.372
Do you know something?

41:01.460 --> 41:02.950
I have no idea what you're implying.

41:03.045 --> 41:04.205
I think you do.

41:06.381 --> 41:10.499
Who is this woman? His mother.
This Emma Swan.

41:13.722 --> 41:16.885
I would say you think you know
exactly who she is.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.635
Now, I really must be going.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.220
Tell me what you know about her.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.349
I'm not gonna answer you, dear.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.435
So I suggest you excuse me.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.069
Please.
