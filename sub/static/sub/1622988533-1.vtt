<i>We think</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:50.866
<i>I had a plan.</i>

15:51.492 --> 15:54.787
<i>Liz was to go away to grad school</i>

<i>That was the plan before she met you.</i>

15:57.373 --> 16:02.044
<i>Now, you want to stay, do that,</i>

<i>[sighs]</i>

<i>Yeah, I just… I just thought about it.</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

16:38.288 --> 16:42.209
<i>No, Marion, you're right. I can't.</i>
<i>I… I can't do it. But you know what?</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:44.169
<i>I'm gonna do it.</i>

16:44.920 --> 16:47.423
<i>Yeah, I'm… I'mma do it.</i>
<i>I'm gonna bring Maddy up.</i>

<i>-And because I love her.</i>
<i>-[Marion] I know you love her.</i>

16:53.887 --> 16:56.682
<i>Do you know that I love her, Marion,</i>
<i>because I doubt that you really do.</i>

16:56.765 --> 16:59.059
<i>I have no doubt you love that baby.</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:01.729
<i>I have no doubt you loved my Liz.</i>

17:02.980 --> 17:06.233
<i>But you wanna keep Maddy to yourself</i>
<i>because you need a life raft.</i>

17:07.776 --> 17:09.403
<i>I'm sorry I messed up your plan.</i>

<i>Marion!</i>

<i>If there's one piece of advice that</i>

<i>[chuckles] But we don't have any control.</i>

<i>And it made me happy to see that.</i>

<i>You know? That's why</i>
<i>I can't, uh… I can't have that time.</i>

19:14.444 --> 19:17.489

<i>and… and come in as you need me. You know?</i>

<i>-What have you animated?</i>
<i>-I work on a show called </i>Lucky Jim<i>.</i>

<i>You let her watch </i>Lucky Jim<i>?</i>

53:00.802 --> 53:01.887
<i>Yeah, it's a cartoon.</i>

<i>-Yeah, he's a leprechaun.</i>

53:14.983 --> 53:19.321
<i>A really lucky, really horny leprechaun.</i>

53:21.156 --> 53:23.700
<i>Is there, like, a warning on it</i>
<i>that kids shouldn't watch it?</i>

53:23.783 --> 53:25.493
<i>There's definitely a warning.</i>

53:31.583 --> 53:34.002
<i>[in Irish accent] Begorra,</i>
the pot of gold is right over there.

53:34.085 --> 53:36.213
<i>And now that rainbow's up and disappeared.</i>

53:42.510 --> 53:46.389
<i>[woman]</i> I've no objection

53:46.473 --> 53:47.515
<i>I'm seeing stars.</i>

53:47.599 --> 53:50.018
<i>[woman] </i>You'll be seeing
more than stars in a moment.

53:50.518 --> 53:51.394
<i>That's it.</i>

53:52.979 --> 53:55.065
<i>-Oh, that's off.</i>
<i>-Daddy, they were about to wrestle.</i>

53:55.148 --> 53:57.651
<i>I know that.</i>
<i>I know that. And that's a little…</i>

53:57.734 --> 53:59.945
<i>It's a little too violent</i>
<i>for you to watch, honey.</i>

54:00.445 --> 54:02.113
<i>-Wait, did you call her?</i>
<i>-Zip it.</i>

54:02.197 --> 54:04.991
<i>-What do you mean, "Zip it"?</i>
<i>-Zip it. Don't be a bonehead.</i>

54:05.075 --> 54:06.993
<i>-Why I gotta be a bonehead?</i>
<i>-Don't be a bonehead.</i>

54:07.077 --> 54:09.454
<i>-Maddy can handle it, right?</i>
<i>-Stop. What'd I ask you to do?</i>

<i>-Jordan, what'd I say?</i>
<i>-Look, I got this.</i>

54:12.457 --> 54:13.625
<i>-Jordan, I don't--</i>
<i>-I got this.</i>

54:13.708 --> 54:15.669
<i>-Jordan--</i>
<i>-That's what friends are for.</i>

54:15.752 --> 54:17.921
<i>Sometimes two adults</i>
<i>meet each other, right?</i>

54:18.004 --> 54:19.631
<i>And they fall in love.</i>

54:19.714 --> 54:21.675
<i>And then they both are nearsighted.</i>

54:22.342 --> 54:25.303
<i>Have that in common</i>
<i>and all these beautiful things.</i>

54:25.387 --> 54:27.555
<i>They take long walks in the park together.</i>

54:27.639 --> 54:29.641
<i>You know, you find that special someone.</i>

54:30.517 --> 54:34.604
<i>But then they get real petty one day</i>
<i>and kick you in your back</i>

54:35.188 --> 54:36.856
<i>'cause you snoring while you sleep.</i>

54:36.940 --> 54:38.566
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-You're sleeping on the floor.</i>

54:38.650 --> 54:39.859
<i>-You're all messed up.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

54:39.943 --> 54:42.612
<i>-Carpet burns on your arm.</i>
<i>-That's-- What are you-- That's enough!</i>

54:42.696 --> 54:44.155
<i>-It's not enough, okay?</i>
<i>-It is enough.</i>

54:44.239 --> 54:46.616
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>if you're gonna find a special someone.</i>

54:46.700 --> 54:48.702
<i>You're not talking about nobody</i>
<i>but yourself--</i>

54:48.785 --> 54:50.412
<i>You know he's talking</i>
<i>about himself, right?</i>

54:50.495 --> 54:54.874
<i>I know. But if they liked each other,</i>
<i>and then they didn't like each other,</i>

54:54.958 --> 54:58.878
<i>couldn't they like each other again?</i>
<i>And wouldn't that be fun?</i>

55:00.130 --> 55:01.965
<i>-Yeah, Maddy.</i>
<i>-Wow.</i>

55:02.549 --> 55:05.051
<i>Give me a high five</i>
<i>or something, a hug. Come here.</i>

55:05.135 --> 55:07.137
<i>-I mean…</i>
<i>-You are brilliant. You a genius.</i>

55:07.220 --> 55:09.389
<i>Gotta be to make sense</i>
<i>of all that stuff you just said.</i>

55:09.472 --> 55:12.475
<i>Don't be a hater.</i>
<i>I wanna-- Look, you are so smart.</i>

55:12.559 --> 55:14.394
<i>You definitely don't get that</i>
<i>from your daddy.</i>

55:16.563 --> 55:18.148
<i>[boy] How come you wear boys' pants?</i>

55:18.231 --> 55:20.191
<i>Okay, stay together. No running.</i>

55:20.275 --> 55:22.277
<i>Hey, Maddy, are you a boy?</i>

55:22.360 --> 55:23.445
<i>Are you a girl?</i>

55:23.528 --> 55:24.696
<i>Zip it, bonehead!</i>

55:24.779 --> 55:25.780
<i>Madeline!</i>

55:27.407 --> 55:30.410
<i>I really don't understand this.</i>
<i>The kid was teasin' her.</i>

55:30.493 --> 55:32.370
<i>Maybe you should talk</i>
<i>to that kid's parents.</i>

55:32.454 --> 55:33.288
<i>I have.</i>

55:33.371 --> 55:37.250
<i>But he was teasing her because</i>
<i>she was the only girl wearing pants.</i>

55:37.959 --> 55:41.338
<i>What if a boy wanted to come</i>
<i>to school dressed in a skirt?</i>

55:42.422 --> 55:45.175
<i>Then that's that boy's business.</i>
<i>It's the 21st century.</i>

55:45.258 --> 55:49.846
<i>Mr. Logelin, Madeline is in kindergarten.</i>
<i>She doesn't have a mother to model after.</i>

55:49.929 --> 55:54.351
<i>I am well aware</i>
<i>of what my daughter doesn't have.</i>

55:55.685 --> 55:59.731
<i>You have to at least show her</i>
<i>that wearing girls' clothing is an option.</i>

56:00.565 --> 56:03.526
<i>I just don't… I just don't understand</i>
<i>why nuns are so tough.</i>

56:04.194 --> 56:08.323
<i>Why are you guys so tough? Like, what…</i>
<i>what is it that happens in nun camp</i>

56:08.406 --> 56:10.116
<i>that makes you guys this strict?</i>

56:12.494 --> 56:15.914
<i>I'm not gonna say anything else because</i>
<i>I don't wanna get struck by lightning.</i>

56:15.997 --> 56:18.708
<i>Okay, here you go, Maddy.</i>
<i>What about these here?</i>

56:19.584 --> 56:22.003
<i>No. I want these.</i>

56:22.629 --> 56:24.172
<i>-[Matt] You want those?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

56:25.548 --> 56:26.383
<i>Um…</i>

56:27.675 --> 56:29.677
<i>Okay, if that's what you want.</i>

56:30.845 --> 56:31.846
<i>Are you going out?</i>

56:31.930 --> 56:36.684
<i>Yes. Rose is coming over,</i>
<i>and Daddy's gonna go out.</i>

56:37.394 --> 56:39.312
<i>-[grunts]</i>
<i>-With Oscar?</i>

56:39.938 --> 56:41.106
<i>No, not with Oscar.</i>

56:41.856 --> 56:43.441
<i>With Jordan?</i>

56:43.525 --> 56:44.984
<i>No, not with Jordan.</i>

56:45.652 --> 56:46.569
<i>A lady?</i>

56:47.862 --> 56:49.030
<i>Yes, it's a lady.</i>

56:49.823 --> 56:50.907
<i>Does that bother you?</i>

56:50.990 --> 56:53.159
<i>-Does it bother you?</i>
<i>-I asked first.</i>

56:53.243 --> 56:56.037
<i>Is it Sister Kathleen from school?</i>

56:56.121 --> 56:59.165
<i>No, it is not Sister Kathleen from school.</i>

56:59.249 --> 57:00.959
<i>Then that's okay. Who is it?</i>

57:01.042 --> 57:02.836
<i>It's a lady friend</i>
<i>from the birthday party.</i>

57:07.966 --> 57:08.967
<i>You know what?</i>

57:09.634 --> 57:11.177
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

57:11.928 --> 57:15.432
<i>See, I was gonna wait till you got older.</i>
<i>This was Mommy's jewelry box.</i>

57:15.515 --> 57:19.477
<i>I want you to pick something out</i>
<i>of here that can be just for you.</i>

57:19.561 --> 57:22.272
<i>-Anything?</i>
<i>-Anything you want.</i>

57:23.731 --> 57:24.566
<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>Hmm, let me put it on you.</i>

<i>Is she in this? Mommy?</i>

<i>Yeah, she's in there.</i>
<i>She's in you. She's in me. She's in…</i>

<i>She's in whoever she touched.</i>

58:09.611 --> 58:10.570
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>-So…</i>

58:10.653 --> 58:12.030
<i>And what did she say to that?</i>

58:12.113 --> 58:15.533
<i>Oh, she said</i>
<i>that her mom is in her because of DNA.</i>

58:16.242 --> 58:18.578
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-Yeah, that's-- I swear to God.</i>

58:18.661 --> 58:20.205
<i>What? Is she some kind of genius?</i>

58:20.288 --> 58:22.832
<i>You know what it is?</i>
<i>Maddy just asks a lot of questions.</i>

58:22.916 --> 58:25.168
<i>-[Lizzie] Mmm.</i>
<i>-I took her to this mummy show.</i>

58:25.251 --> 58:30.131
<i>They were talking about DNA at the show,</i>
<i>so I tried to explain to her what DNA was.</i>

<i>-And in doing that, she just…</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

<i>[Lizzie] Hmm.</i>

1:16:10.107 --> 1:16:11.567
