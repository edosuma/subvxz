00:14.615 --> 00:15.786

00:15.786 --> 00:17.288
HOW ABOUT WE SET YOU UP

00:17.288 --> 00:19.150

CAN STAY WITH HIM THERE?

00:19.150 --> 00:21.252

A CLEAR READ OFF ZOLA'S SAMPLE.

00:42.313 --> 00:44.315

HAVE TO RUN IT AGAIN.

00:44.315 --> 00:45.816
ALL RIGHT.
BUT YOURS CAME OUT.

00:45.816 --> 00:47.418

GIVES US TONS OF INFORMATION.

01:01.732 --> 01:03.794
SOME OF IT'S CLEAR.

IT'S DECADES AWAY.

06:00.891 --> 06:02.663
IT MIGHT NOT BE.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.465
WE HAVE A CHILD

06:04.465 --> 06:06.096

06:47.878 --> 06:51.041

THE CONTENTS OF THIS TRAY.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.658

07:10.461 --> 07:13.834

HAD ALL OF THESE THINGS,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.036

CANNOT REACH US,

08:02.653 --> 08:03.754
(exhales)
MM.

08:05.015 --> 08:06.587
DR. SHEPHERD, HEY.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.918
I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON
THE PATIENTS WE SAW YESTERDAY,

08:07.918 --> 08:09.089
'CAUSE I CARE.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.060
ROSS, YOU SHOULD BE
LEARNING SOMETHING ELSE

08:10.060 --> 08:11.221
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

08:11.221 --> 08:12.763
OH, I AM.
I'M COVERING THE PIT,

08:12.763 --> 08:14.064
WHICH I CAN DO
AND MANAGE YOUR POST-OPS.

08:14.064 --> 08:16.026
ALSO, I BROUGHT YOU
A LATTE.

08:16.026 --> 08:17.628
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB
TO BRING MY COFFEE.

08:17.628 --> 08:19.630
SORRY. I'M HERE.
I HAD TO GET A PIECE OF GUM.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.071
I HAD EPICALLY BAD BREATH.

08:21.071 --> 08:23.133
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BOWL
YOU OVER IN THE O.R., BUT...

08:23.133 --> 08:24.274
(clenched teeth)
I'M ALL SET. SEE?
(elevator bell dings)

08:24.274 --> 08:25.806
I DIDN'T NEED TO SEE IT.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.978
OKAY. WELL, I'M GOING
TO CHECK YOUR POST-OPS.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.680
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE ME
TO LOOK FOR?

08:29.680 --> 08:31.041
ROSS ALREADY DID IT.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.643
SPECTACULAR.

08:32.643 --> 08:34.014
ANYTHING WE SHOULD KNOW?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.747
YEAH,
RACHEL DAWSON'S AWAKE.

08:36.747 --> 08:38.689
UM...

08:38.689 --> 08:40.791
TELL HUNT SHE'S UP.

08:40.791 --> 08:43.954
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU BACK
WITH A BUNCH OF EQUIPMENT,

08:43.954 --> 08:45.255
UH, BUT IF SUPPLIES
AREN'T REACHING YOU

08:45.255 --> 08:46.797
AND THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY,

08:46.797 --> 08:48.228
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.930
YEAH, SO, UM,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND

08:49.930 --> 08:52.703
AND SEE WHAT ITEMS YOU DO
HAVE LEFT IN THE FIELD HOSPITAL,

08:52.703 --> 08:55.065
AND, UH, PUT IT IN THE BOX.

08:55.065 --> 08:56.136
(mouths words)

08:56.136 --> 08:58.008
MM-HMM.

08:59.810 --> 09:01.872
DR. HUNT.
CAN I BORROW YOU?

09:01.872 --> 09:03.173
(indistinct conversations)

09:03.173 --> 09:05.175
I DON'T THINK
I SHOULD GO IN THERE.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.177
SHE'S OKAY NOW, ETHAN.

09:07.177 --> 09:09.580
SHE WAS REALLY MAD
WHEN SHE SAW ME BEFORE.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.021
SHE WASN'T MAD AT YOU.
SHE WAS CONFUSED.

09:11.021 --> 09:13.023
THERE'S SOMETHING IN HER HEAD
THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIX,

09:13.023 --> 09:14.955
AND THEY'VE DONE THAT.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.987
SHE'S BACK
TO HER OLD SELF AGAIN.

09:18.929 --> 09:20.931
(click)

09:20.931 --> 09:23.864
YOU SURE?

09:23.864 --> 09:25.095
(sighs)

09:25.095 --> 09:27.267
I DON'T KNOW 100%, ETHAN,
BUT...

09:27.267 --> 09:30.100
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY,
OKAY?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.102
(sighs)

09:32.102 --> 09:33.674
ALL RIGHT.

09:40.150 --> 09:42.152
ETHAN?

09:42.152 --> 09:44.885
(crying) YOU'RE OKAY?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.587
(laughs) COME HERE.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.120
(continues crying)

09:50.120 --> 09:52.763
OH. (laughs)

09:52.763 --> 09:53.994
OH, GOD.

09:53.994 --> 09:57.127
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.999
DID YOU GET HURT?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.370
NO?

10:00.370 --> 10:01.672
(laughs)

10:01.672 --> 10:03.634
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.

10:03.634 --> 10:05.605
(laughs)

10:05.605 --> 10:06.777
(indistinct conversations)

10:06.777 --> 10:07.978
MY CAR CRASH MOM
WOKE UP.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.040
AND THE LAWYER SENT OVER
AN E-MAIL

10:10.040 --> 10:11.381
WITH THE FORMS.

10:11.381 --> 10:13.383
WE NEED TWO NAMES--
A GUARDIAN AND A BACKUP.

10:13.383 --> 10:15.385
BEFORE IT WAS LEXIE,
CRISTINA, AND OWEN.

10:15.385 --> 10:17.087
SO CRISTINA AND THEN
WHICH ONE OF YOUR SISTERS

10:17.087 --> 10:18.388
DO YOU WANT AS A BACKUP?

10:18.388 --> 10:20.090
CRISTINA
DOESN'T WANT CHILDREN.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.251
THIS ISN'T CHILDREN.
IT'S ZOLA AND FETUS.

10:21.251 --> 10:23.724
STOP
CALLING THE BABY FETUS.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.156
WELL, SHE WILL LOVE HIM
WHATEVER HIS NAME IS.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.028
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO HER
AND SEE WHAT SHE SAYS.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.629
I KNOW WHAT SHE'LL SAY.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.062
AND I'LL BE WRONG, AND THAT'LL
BE GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.

10:32.062 --> 10:33.033
(kisses)

10:34.404 --> 10:38.769
(woman over P.A.
speaking indistinctly)

10:38.769 --> 10:41.011
MY TALK
WAS A VIRAL SENSATION.

10:41.011 --> 10:43.744
(singsongy)
CARTILAGE IS TRENDING...

10:43.744 --> 10:45.045
(normal voice)
BECAUSE OF ME.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.246
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.948
A CARTILAGE REGENERATION LAB

10:47.948 --> 10:49.920
WOULD BE A HUGE BOON
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.651
I AM NOT AN A.T.M.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.983
I HAVE ONE VOTE
JUST LIKE YOU DO

10:52.983 --> 10:54.384
AND ARIZONA DOES.

10:54.384 --> 10:56.687
OH, NO. ARIZONA HAS TO VOTE
FOR ME 'CAUSE SHE'S MY WIFE.

10:56.687 --> 10:58.128
AND YOUR VOTE IS LIKE
A VOTE AND A HALF.

10:58.128 --> 10:59.289
UH-HUH.
I'LL VOTE FOR MYSELF.

10:59.289 --> 11:01.661
NOW THAT
IS A SOLID VOTING BLOCK.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.193
YOU PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT
INTO THIS, HUH?
(speaks indistinctly)

11:03.193 --> 11:04.765
IS THIS HOW IT WORKS?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.096
YOU ALL WHISPER TO EACH OTHER
IN YOUR BOARD MEETINGS

11:06.096 --> 11:07.838
ABOUT YOUR PET PROJECTS,

11:07.838 --> 11:09.099
AND THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE MONEY GOES?
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS.

11:09.099 --> 11:10.871
THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.903
EVERYBODY'S SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT
THEIR PROPOSALS IN WRITING.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.444
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE
BUGGING BOARD MEMBERS

11:14.444 --> 11:16.146
WHILE THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK.

11:16.146 --> 11:18.879
UH... YOU'RE SITTING
IN A CHAIR.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.981
I NEED MONEY FOR MY ORPHAN
THING. I WANT TO TAKE IT GLOBAL.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.152
YOU SEE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

11:22.152 --> 11:23.814
WHO CANCELED
MY VALVE REPLACEMENT?

11:23.814 --> 11:25.956
HUNT CANCELED
HALF OF EVERYBODY'S DAY.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.718
(Owen) THANK YOU
FOR COMING, EVERYONE.

11:27.718 --> 11:29.159
SORRY WE HAD TO
REARRANGE YOUR SCHEDULE,

11:29.159 --> 11:30.891
BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.823
WE'VE GOT
TWO SYRIAN DOCTORS HERE.

11:32.823 --> 11:34.164
THEY USED TO BE G.P.s,

11:34.164 --> 11:35.866
BUT NOW THEY'RE OPERATING
IN A FIELD HOSPITAL

11:35.866 --> 11:37.167
IN A WAR ZONE.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.899
WE WERE PLANNING ON TEACHING
THEM SURGICAL PROCEDURES

11:38.899 --> 11:40.470
THEY COULD DO
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES,

11:40.470 --> 11:42.472
BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY HAVE
WAY LESS TO WORK WITH

11:42.472 --> 11:44.004
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.175
JUST GIVE 'EM MORE STUFF.

11:45.175 --> 11:46.336
WHEN IT RUNS OUT IN TWO WEEKS,

11:46.336 --> 11:47.978
THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WHERE THEY STARTED.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.709
HE WANTS TO HELP THEM FUNCTION
WITH WHAT THEY KNOW THEY HAVE.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.181
WHICH IS THIS.

11:51.181 --> 11:53.383
SO... WE NEED TO

11:53.383 --> 11:56.186
BE ABLE TO DO THE PROCEDURES
ON THIS LIST

11:56.186 --> 11:59.119
USING ONLY
WHAT IS IN THIS BOX.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.221
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THERE'S NO WAY.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.193
THERE HAS TO BE.
WE GOTTA FIGURE IT OUT.

12:03.193 --> 12:05.395
(all speak indistinctly)

12:05.395 --> 12:06.997
(typing)

12:06.997 --> 12:09.429
JOYCE BASCHE'S LABS.
SHE'S IN ULTRASOUND NOW.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.161
MM. HER WHITE COUNT'S
PRETTY HIGH.

12:11.161 --> 12:12.462
AND HER ELECTROLYTES ARE OFF.

12:12.462 --> 12:14.164
UM, I THINK WE ERR
ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION

12:14.164 --> 12:15.836
AND ADMIT HER.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.938
AND, UH, THIS IS
KIND OF WEIRD.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.110
UM, WE HAVE ANOTHER
POST-OP COMPLICATION

12:20.110 --> 12:21.912
ON THE SAME DAY
AS MRS. BASCHE.

12:21.912 --> 12:24.875
AND, UH, I SCRUBBED IN
ON BOTH OF THEM WITH YOU.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.877
AND YOU MANAGED
THEIR POST-OP CARE?

12:29.279 --> 12:30.821
OKAY, YOU BETTER GO THROUGH

12:30.821 --> 12:32.052
ALL YOUR NOTES
ON BOTH THESE CHARTS

12:32.052 --> 12:33.884
AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL WENT WRONG.

12:33.884 --> 12:35.255
EDWARDS,
YOU'RE WITH ME TODAY.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.887
I'M WITH DR. AVERY TODAY.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.829
DITCH HIM.
MURPHY'S HAVING A TIME-OUT.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.193
(whispers) WHAT DID YOU DO?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.243
(woman speaks indistinctly)

12:53.243 --> 12:56.046
SO THE SECOND POST-OP INFECTION
WAS YOUR PATIENT, TOO?

12:56.046 --> 12:57.007
KATHY DONG.

12:57.007 --> 12:58.178
MM-HMM.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.950
DOES SHE NEED SURGERY?
PROBABLY.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.082
AND BAILEY GOT MEDUSA TO
SCRUB IN WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON

13:02.082 --> 13:04.084
ON THE FIRST LADY THAT
CAME IN WITH AN INFECTION.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.515
THEY'VE GOTTA TAKE OUT
HER SHUNT.

13:05.515 --> 13:07.017
IT'S GOT THIS HUGE ABSCESS
UNDER IT.

13:07.017 --> 13:08.558
IT'S A MESS.

13:08.558 --> 13:10.290
(sighs)
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.092
(inhales deeply)
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:12.092 --> 13:15.095
DID YOU FORGET THE PRE-OP
ANTIBIOTICS OR SCRUB TOO FAST?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.267
(lowered voice) I WAS SICK.
I HAD THE FLU OR SOMETHING.

13:17.267 --> 13:18.468
AND YOU CAME IN?

13:18.468 --> 13:19.830
OF COURSE I DID.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.401
WE ALL WORK WHEN WERE SICK,
ALL THE TIME.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.973
PATIENTS HAVE
POST-OP INFECTIONS

13:22.973 --> 13:25.005
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

13:26.206 --> 13:27.377
(sighs)

13:27.377 --> 13:29.079
OKAY, SO THEY CAN
DEBRIDE THE WOUNDS

13:29.079 --> 13:30.480
WITH A BASIC INSTRUMENT SET,

13:30.480 --> 13:32.012
BUT NOW THEY'RE FACED WITH
A HUGE RISK OF INFECTION.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.044
WELL, I GUESS WOUND VACS
ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION THEN.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.216
SIMPLE WET-TO-DRY DRESSINGS
MIGHT WORK?

13:36.216 --> 13:37.547
(Callie) MM. NO.

13:37.547 --> 13:39.349
THEY'D HAVE TO CHANGE THOSE OUT
THREE TIMES A DAY.

13:39.349 --> 13:41.421
THEY WOULD USE THEIR ENTIRE
GAUZE SUPPLY WITH ONE PATIENT.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.553
(sighs)
SUGAR.

13:43.553 --> 13:44.995
EXCUSE ME?

13:44.995 --> 13:46.957
IT'S NOT IN THE BOX,
BUT THEY MAY HAVE IT AROUND.

13:46.957 --> 13:48.258
IT'S AN OSMOTIC DRESSING

13:48.258 --> 13:50.300
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO AVOID
MULTIPLE DRESSING CHANGES.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.933
OKAY. WELL, SOMEBODY GO FIND OUT
IF THEY STILL HAVE SUGAR.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.834
OKAY.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.336
(Cristina) ANYTHING?
(Derek)
YOU'VE BARELY MADE A DENT.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.467
IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.969
OH! WELL, YOU TRY USING
THIS HAND DRILL,

13:58.969 --> 14:01.041
MR. BACKSEAT DRIVER.
LET ME TRY.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.542
IF THEY HAD AN INFRASCANNER,
IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.174
WELL, THEY DON'T.
I THINK WHOEVER IT IS,

14:04.174 --> 14:06.276
YOU JUST KILLED HIM.
YOU KNOW,
START WITH A FRESH ONE.

14:06.276 --> 14:07.447
OH, DOES ANYBODY HAVE
ANY BETADINE?

14:07.447 --> 14:08.979
I JUST HAVE BLEACH.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.021
(Derek)
YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.
SURE.

14:11.021 --> 14:12.152
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.884
SO ANYBODY READY
TO START TEACHING?

14:13.884 --> 14:15.355
UH, ME.
I CAN DO FRACTURE REPAIRS.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.987
YEAH, YOU CAN PUT ME DOWN.

14:16.987 --> 14:18.288
I GOT A BLADE I CAN USE
FOR SKIN GRAFTING.

14:18.288 --> 14:20.060
GREAT. GET TO THE LAB.
UH, SHEPHERD,

14:20.060 --> 14:21.861
HOW LONG TILL RACHEL DAWSON'S
OUT OF THE I.C.U.?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.033
OH, CHECK WITH ROSS.

14:23.033 --> 14:24.264
HE'S TRACKING HER
THROUGH POST-OP.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.136
WAIT. I THOUGHT BROOKS
WAS ON YOUR SERVICE TODAY.

14:26.136 --> 14:27.567
(exhales) ROSS GETS
CONNECTED TO THE PATIENTS.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.969
HE LIKES TO FOLLOW THROUGH.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.972
OWEN, PEDS JUST CALLED.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.974
ETHAN DAWSON'S GRANDMOTHER
GOT STUCK BACK EAST.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.175
HER FLIGHT GOT CANCELED,

14:35.175 --> 14:37.077
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA
MAKE IT HERE UNTIL TOMORROW.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.648
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL
SOCIAL SERVICES

14:38.648 --> 14:40.380
AND SEE IF THEY CAN TAKE HIM
FOR THE NIGHT.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.983
(sighs)

14:42.983 --> 14:45.015
(hand drill squeaking)

14:45.015 --> 14:47.017
BUT THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD,
RIGHT?

14:47.017 --> 14:48.318
THIS MUST HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME.

14:48.318 --> 14:52.022
IT'S AN UNUSUALLY AGGRESSIVE
INFECTION.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.463
BUT WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:53.463 --> 14:55.025
AH, SHE SAID IT WAS NOTHING,
AND I KNEW IT.

14:55.025 --> 14:56.226
STEVEN--
NO.

14:56.226 --> 14:58.969
I WAITED A WHOLE DAY.

14:58.969 --> 15:02.272
I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF HER, YOU HEAR ME?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.507
(speaking indistinctly)

15:09.109 --> 15:12.612
AND NOW EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ELECTRIC DERMATOME,

15:12.612 --> 15:15.145
YOU CAN STILL DO SKIN GRAFTS
USING BLADES.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.017
BUT YOU WANT TO BE
VERY CAREFUL

15:17.017 --> 15:18.518
ABOUT HOW MUCH PRESSURE
YOU APPLY.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.220
YOU DON'T WANT
TO CUT TOO DEEP.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.022
MM. IS THAT OKAY?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.994
THAT'S GOOD.
BUT NO DEEPER.

15:23.994 --> 15:25.295
YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

15:25.295 --> 15:26.997
OKAY, SO YOU WANT
TO PLACE THE SCREWS

HE WANTS IT IN WRITING.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.463
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:13.463 --> 23:14.624
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME

23:14.624 --> 23:15.795
A LETHAL DOSE OF MORPHINE

23:15.795 --> 23:17.997
THE SECOND I START TO FORGET
WHERE MY KEYS ARE.

23:17.997 --> 23:18.998
I'M NOT KIDDING.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.670
BEFORE WE KNEW
MY MOTHER WAS SICK,

23:20.670 --> 23:22.672
SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
I'D EVER SAID TO HER.

23:22.672 --> 23:24.834
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
SHE DIDN'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ME.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.506
I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY KIDS
THROUGH THAT.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.538
YOU'LL GIVE ME A LETHAL DOSE,
WE'LL HOLD HANDS,

23:28.538 --> 23:30.009
AND I'LL FADE OFF
INTO THE NIGHT.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.482
WE WILL CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE COME TO IT.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.047
MORE IRRIGATION.

23:38.047 --> 23:40.520
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO
OPEN THIS ALL UP.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.552
YOU DOING OKAY?

23:42.552 --> 23:43.593
I'M FINE.

23:43.593 --> 23:44.894
YOU SURE?

23:44.894 --> 23:46.025
DR. BAILEY, DON'T GET
ALL WEIRD ON ME

23:46.025 --> 23:47.657
BECAUSE YOU THINK
YOU SHATTERED MY PSYCHE.

23:47.657 --> 23:49.899
I KNEW WHAT I WAS ASKING
WHEN I TOOK THAT TEST.

23:49.899 --> 23:51.100
WELL, IF YOU EVER NEED
TO TALK...

23:51.100 --> 23:52.862
STOP IT.

23:52.862 --> 23:54.464
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

23:54.464 --> 23:56.836
HOW ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT
THE SLOPPY JOB YOU'RE DOING

23:56.836 --> 23:58.067
RAISING THOSE CRAPPY INTERNS?

23:58.067 --> 23:59.569
THERE YOU GO.

23:59.569 --> 24:01.110
(scoffs) WHAT, SHE SNEEZED
ALL OVER MY PATIENTS,

24:01.110 --> 24:03.473
NOW I HAVE
TWO POST-OP INFECTIONS?

24:03.473 --> 24:05.645
THEY HAVE NO JUDGMENT

24:05.645 --> 24:07.577
OR COMMON SENSE.

24:07.577 --> 24:09.519
MM. SORRY TO BUTT IN,
BAILEY.

24:09.519 --> 24:11.681
I SAW A PATIENT OF YOURS
FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK.

24:11.681 --> 24:14.083
POST-OP INFECTION,
PRETTY EXTENSIVE.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.486
HE'S ON I.V. ANTIBIOTICS,
BUT HE'S GONNA NEED SURGERY.

24:16.486 --> 24:18.488
YOU HAVE TIME TODAY
OR YOU WANT ME TO HANDLE IT?

24:18.488 --> 24:20.490
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE?
HE'S A SHE, AND I SAW HER.

24:20.490 --> 24:21.831
I'M DEALING WITH HER

24:21.831 --> 24:23.833
AFTER I DEAL WITH
THIS POST-OP INFECTION.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.695
IT'S NOT A SHE.

24:25.695 --> 24:28.067
SETH LEPIK.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.769
(Meredith)
IT'S NOT THE SAME PATIENT.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.601
IT'S A THIRD ONE.

24:32.872 --> 24:36.475
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:44.083 --> 24:46.255
THREE?
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HUNT?

24:46.255 --> 24:48.117
NO, NOT YET.
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST TWO.

24:48.117 --> 24:49.819
LOOK, I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOUR THIRD PATIENT.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.921
YOU NEED TO FIND HUNT.

24:51.921 --> 24:54.493
(indistinct conversations)

24:54.493 --> 24:55.765
WHICH INTERN WAS IT?

24:55.765 --> 24:56.966
IT'S LEAH MURPHY.

24:58.127 --> 25:03.873
(woman speaking indistinctly)

25:07.637 --> 25:10.209
DR. DARWISH,
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.612
OH, NO. I'M...

25:12.612 --> 25:15.685
(chuckles) JUST LOOKING.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.189
IT'S QUIET.

25:20.189 --> 25:24.153
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF QUIET ANYMORE.

25:29.599 --> 25:31.861
SO THERE'S BEEN
A BIG RAINSTORM BACK EAST,

25:31.861 --> 25:33.232
AND YOUR GRANDMA'S FLIGHT

25:33.232 --> 25:35.134
ISN'T GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET IN UNTIL TOMORROW,

25:35.134 --> 25:37.266
SO CAROL HERE
FROM SOCIAL SERVICES

25:37.266 --> 25:39.168
IS GOING TO
TAKE YOU TO A PLACE

25:39.168 --> 25:41.070
THAT YOU CAN SLEEP TONIGHT.

25:41.070 --> 25:43.843
WHY CAN'T I STAY HERE
LIKE WE DID LAST NIGHT?

25:43.843 --> 25:46.115
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK OUT.

25:46.115 --> 25:48.678
I DON'T WANT TO GO WITH HER.
MY MOM AND DAD ARE HERE.

25:48.678 --> 25:50.019
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

25:50.019 --> 25:52.051
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A GREAT DINNER...

25:52.051 --> 25:54.023
(breathing heavily)
AND THEY'LL PROBABLY GIVE YOU
ICE CREAM FOR DESSERT,

25:54.023 --> 25:56.125
AND THEY'RE GONNA LET YOU
PLAY VIDEO GAMES, SO...

25:56.125 --> 25:57.827
(continues breathing heavily)

25:57.827 --> 25:59.328
HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME ON.

25:59.328 --> 26:01.731
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.
I PROMISE.

26:01.731 --> 26:03.132
(continues breathing heavily)

26:05.595 --> 26:07.937
OKAY, IS THAT...

26:07.937 --> 26:09.098
(snaps)

26:09.098 --> 26:10.569
BETTER?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.702
YEAH. UH, BUT, UH, PRACTICE IT
A BUNCH MORE TIMES.

26:12.702 --> 26:14.203
THE FASTER YOU GET
IN AND OUT,

26:14.203 --> 26:17.176
THE BETTER YOUR OUTCOMES
WILL BE.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.278
PROMISE ME YOU'LL KILL ME
WITH A LETHAL INJECTION

26:19.278 --> 26:21.180
BEFORE I START TO FORGET
WHERE MY KEYS ARE.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.581
OF COURSE.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.753
EARLY.

26:23.753 --> 26:25.254
NOT WHEN I SET THE HOUSE
ON FIRE

26:25.254 --> 26:26.956
BECAUSE I FORGOT
TO SHUT THE STOVE OFF

26:26.956 --> 26:28.287
OR WHEN I'M SITTING
IN THE ROCKING CHAIR

26:28.287 --> 26:29.889
IN THE CORNER
OF THE NURSING HOME.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.891
I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO GO
THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH--

26:31.891 --> 26:34.894
MER, YOU HAD ME
AT "LETHAL INJECTION."

26:34.894 --> 26:38.597
(woman speaking indistinctly)

26:38.597 --> 26:40.700
WOW. IS THAT MY DOOR PRIZE?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.601
(clears throat) OKAY,
SO YOU KNOW I WAS WORKING

26:42.601 --> 26:44.133
WITH THESE TWO SYRIAN GUYS
TODAY?

26:44.133 --> 26:45.274
THEY BARELY GET
ANY SUPPLIES ANYMORE.

26:45.274 --> 26:47.677
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL
THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH.

26:47.677 --> 26:49.138
BUT THE ATTENDINGS
ALL PITCHED IN,

26:49.138 --> 26:51.080
AND WE FIGURED OUT
A WHOLE BUNCH

26:51.080 --> 26:53.943
OF LIFESAVING PROCEDURES
THEY CAN DO.

26:53.943 --> 26:55.214
THAT'S GREAT.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.147
YEAH. UM...

26:58.147 --> 27:01.120
MY POINT IS...

27:01.120 --> 27:04.794
(exhales) YOU THINK
YOU NEED EVERYTHING,

27:04.794 --> 27:06.696
BUT YOU DON'T.

27:06.696 --> 27:10.299
WE COULD GET BY WITHOUT
A LOT OF STUFF, RIGHT?

27:10.299 --> 27:12.231
SURE.

27:12.231 --> 27:15.835
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE
GETTING BY WITHOUT?

27:18.637 --> 27:20.339
UH... (exhales)

27:22.311 --> 27:24.273
MY VIRGINITY.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.117
(exhales) I WAS...

27:28.117 --> 27:31.781
I WAS A VIRGIN
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

27:31.781 --> 27:33.382
AND THEN I WASN'T.

27:35.054 --> 27:38.287
UH, I... REALLY WANTED
TO WAIT

27:38.287 --> 27:41.090
FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU...

27:41.090 --> 27:43.092
FOR MARRIAGE,
BUT I SCREWED UP.

27:43.092 --> 27:46.295
AND I WAS JUST--
I WAS SO SCARED TO TELL YOU.

27:46.295 --> 27:48.367
BUT THEN I WAS WATCHING
THESE GUYS TODAY,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.369
AND THEY--THEY LITERALLY
HAVE NOTHING LEFT,

27:50.369 --> 27:52.071
AND THEY'RE MAKING DO.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.273
AND THEN I-I JUST FELT LIKE
I WAS BEING SO STUPID

27:54.273 --> 27:57.246
TO--TO WORRY ABOUT
THIS ONE LITTLE THING,

27:57.246 --> 28:01.250
LI-LIKE--LIKE YOU
COULDN'T EVEN GET OVER IT.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.753
SO...

28:03.753 --> 28:05.955
I GUESS I WOULD BE
AN UNGRATEFUL JERK

28:05.955 --> 28:07.386
IF I WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR VIRGINITY

28:07.386 --> 28:09.258
WHILE THERE'S A WAR
GOING ON SOMEWHERE

28:09.258 --> 28:11.120
AND PEOPLE ARE DYING?

28:11.120 --> 28:14.193
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
TO ME?

28:14.193 --> 28:16.395
NO, NO. I-I-I DIDN'T--

28:16.395 --> 28:19.829
YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D BE
MORE HUNG UP ON THE LYING?

28:19.829 --> 28:24.804
'CAUSE I BET EVEN IN A WAR,
PEOPLE STILL VALUE HONESTY.

28:33.182 --> 28:34.884
HE'S STILL NOT AWAKE?

28:34.884 --> 28:36.185
UH, NO, NOT YET.

28:36.185 --> 28:38.918
I GAVE HIM A BOLUS OF D50.
WE'LL SEE IF THAT HELPS.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.719
WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK
TO ME FIRST?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.291
BECAUSE I TALKED
TO RUSSELL ABOUT IT,

28:42.291 --> 28:44.023
LIKE YOU ASKED ME TO.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.055
BUT YOU KNEW THAT I WAS
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS CASE.

28:46.055 --> 28:48.127
YOU REALLY WANT ME TO HAVE
THREE HIGHLY TRAINED SURGEONS

28:48.127 --> 28:50.159
SUPERVISING
ONE MAN'S RECOVERY?

28:50.159 --> 28:51.300
IT SHOULDN'T BE NEWS TO YOU

28:51.300 --> 28:53.232
THAT WE WORK AS A TEAM
AT THIS HOSPITAL.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.764
OH, YES, AND THE ENTIRE TEAM

28:54.764 --> 28:56.735
IS HELPING YOU SAVE SYRIA
FROM ITSELF.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.067
I CAME UP WITH, LIKE,

28:58.067 --> 28:59.738
14 WAYS OF DOING
THORACOTOMY PROCEDURES

28:59.738 --> 29:01.210
WITHOUT A CHEST TRAY.

29:01.210 --> 29:02.942
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
FOR A GROUPTHINK

29:02.942 --> 29:05.074
ON PERFECTLY STRAIGHTFORWARD
POST-OP CARE.

29:05.074 --> 29:06.245
TOMORROW,
YOU, RUSSELL, MYSELF

29:06.245 --> 29:07.376
WILL ROUND ON PAUL TOGETHER,
ALL RIGHT?

29:07.376 --> 29:08.918
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I AM.

29:08.918 --> 29:10.850
UH, DR. HUNT,
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.021
COULD YOU GIVE ME MOMENT?

29:12.021 --> 29:14.023
IT HAS TO BE NOW.

29:14.023 --> 29:16.325
AND WEBBER'S IN THE O.R.
WITH THE THIRD.

29:16.325 --> 29:21.290
SO WE HAVE NO IDEA
HOW EXTENSIVE THIS IS?

29:21.290 --> 29:22.862
ALL RIGHT.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.163
YOU AND I ARE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO INFECTION CONTROL,

29:24.163 --> 29:25.394
LET THEM KNOW WHAT WE KNOW
SO FAR.

29:25.394 --> 29:27.296
I NEED YOU TO FIND
ALL YOUR CHARTS FROM THAT DAY,

29:27.296 --> 29:29.939
FIGURE OUT EVERY PATIENT
YOU TOUCHED IN POST-OP,

29:29.939 --> 29:31.140
OR ANYWHERE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.401
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CALL
EVERY ONE OF THEM,

29:32.401 --> 29:34.373
HAVE THEM COME IN,
AND EXAM THEM.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.245
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A NIGHTMARE.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.251
THEY'RE GONNA FIRE ME,
AREN'T THEY?

29:42.251 --> 29:43.512
JUST GO.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.324
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:55.324 --> 29:57.796
STILL UNCONSCIOUS?

30:00.399 --> 30:01.971
BUMMER.

30:01.971 --> 30:04.103
IT'S OKAY. HE'LL WAKE UP
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

30:04.103 --> 30:06.435
IF WE CAN ALL RELAX
AND BE PATIENT ABOUT IT.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.337
GOOD.
YEAH, TELL THAT TO OWEN.

30:08.337 --> 30:11.140
WE MAY BE LOSING LEAH MURPHY
FROM THE PROGRAM.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.511
DID I LIKE HER?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.443
I THINK YOU SAID ONCE
THAT SHE DIDN'T SUCK

30:14.443 --> 30:17.016
AS MUCH
AS YOU EXPECTED HER TO SUCK.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.517
OH. THAT'S TOO BAD.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.120
YOU KNOW, MAYBE OWEN
DOESN'T LIKE BEING CHIEF.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.351
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

30:22.351 --> 30:23.492
I THOUGHT HE DID,

30:23.492 --> 30:25.194
BUT LATELY,
HE'S HAD A BUG UP HIS BUTT

30:25.194 --> 30:26.896
ABOUT RUSSELL
NOT SUPERVISING ME.

30:26.896 --> 30:29.258
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
HE MISSES TEACHING.

30:29.258 --> 30:32.231
I MEAN, DEREK--HE HATED
ALL THAT ADMINISTRATIVE CRAP

30:32.231 --> 30:33.462
WHEN HE WAS CHIEF, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

30:33.462 --> 30:35.134
OWEN'S HAD NOTHING
BUT THAT FOR WEEKS.

30:35.134 --> 30:36.265
MAYBE HE FEELS LIKE

30:36.265 --> 30:38.207
HE'S LOSING TOUCH
WITH THE MEDICINE?

30:38.207 --> 30:40.910
OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
RUSSELL'S NOT SUPERVISING YOU.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.413
OKAY, I JUST AGREED
TO OFF YOU

30:44.413 --> 30:46.275
THE MINUTE YOU STARTED
ACTING DOTTY.

30:46.275 --> 30:48.017
SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON MY SIDE
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY

30:48.017 --> 30:51.320
JUST AS A COURTESY?

30:51.320 --> 30:53.152
ROSS WAS WORKING
THE PIT TODAY?

30:53.152 --> 30:55.624
YES.
OKAY, I JUST TOOK OUT
AN INFECTED DIALYSIS GRAFT.

30:55.624 --> 30:57.626
MM.
HE SAW THE PATIENT
BEFORE I DID...

30:57.626 --> 30:59.328
RIGHT.
BUT HE DIDN'T SCRUB IN
WITH ME

30:59.328 --> 31:00.629
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOUR M.R.I.

31:00.629 --> 31:02.331
WAS JUST THE WAY
YOU LIKED IT.

31:02.331 --> 31:04.133
(sighs)
HEY, DR. WEBBER.

31:04.133 --> 31:05.564
SOMEONE JUST PUT
A GLIOBLASTOMA RESECTION

31:05.564 --> 31:07.096
ON YOUR SCHEDULE FOR TOMORROW.

31:07.096 --> 31:10.169
DID YOU WANT TO DO THAT BEFORE
OR AFTER YOUR ANEURYSM?

31:10.169 --> 31:12.371
(elevator bell dings)

31:12.371 --> 31:15.044
SHANE,
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

31:15.044 --> 31:16.375
I AM WORKING
WITH BROOKS NOW.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.308
YEAH, BUT SHE ANNOYS YOU,
DOESN'T SHE?

31:19.308 --> 31:20.309
MM.

31:20.309 --> 31:22.051
I MEAN, YOU AND I
KIND OF GET ALONG.

31:22.051 --> 31:24.453
BROOKS HAS AN INSTINCT
FOR THIS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

31:24.453 --> 31:26.455
YOU MAKE UP FOR IT
WITH A TON OF WORK.

31:26.455 --> 31:29.018
WELL, IF I'M MAKING UP FOR IT,
WHO CARES HOW?

31:29.018 --> 31:31.390
I CARE.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.891
AND YOU SHOULD, TOO.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.965
YOU SHOULD FIND A SPECIALTY
WHERE YOU SHINE.

31:35.965 --> 31:38.027
THIS IS WHAT
I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT.

31:38.027 --> 31:39.668
DOESN'T THAT COUNT
FOR ANYTHING?

31:39.668 --> 31:42.031
SHE'S BETTER AT THIS
THAN YOU ARE.

31:42.031 --> 31:45.234
AND THAT MEANS, TO ME,
I HAVE TO TEACH HER, NOT YOU.

31:45.234 --> 31:46.535
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A GREAT SURGEON.

31:46.535 --> 31:48.337
GO FIGURE OUT WHERE.

31:48.337 --> 31:50.009
HEY.

31:52.181 --> 31:53.482
(sighs)

31:59.418 --> 32:02.021
GUY CAN'T TAKE A HINT,
HUH? (chuckles)

32:02.021 --> 32:03.592
MM-HMM.

32:03.592 --> 32:05.955
WHERE ARE WE GOING, SENSEI?

32:05.955 --> 32:09.558
WE ARE GOING TO CHECK IN
ON RACHEL DAWSON,

32:09.558 --> 32:11.360
SEE IF HER NEURO EXAMS
HAVE IMPROVED.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.962
YOU WENT WITH SPEARMINT GUM
THIS TIME.

32:12.962 --> 32:14.403
YEAH.
YOU CAN SMELL IT?

32:14.403 --> 32:15.564
MM. I CAN.

32:15.564 --> 32:16.935
DO YOU LIKE SPEARMINT?

32:16.935 --> 32:18.407
NOT REALLY, NO.

32:18.407 --> 32:19.708
JUST USE PERIPHERAL
VASCULAR INSTRUMENTS

32:19.708 --> 32:21.240
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
STUFF FOR PEDS.
MM.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.213
OKAY, SO PASS THE UMBILICAL TAPE
AROUND THE VESSEL.

32:24.213 --> 32:26.275
AND THEN THREAD BOTH ENDS

32:26.275 --> 32:28.277
THROUGH THE SHORT
RUBBER CATHETER

32:28.277 --> 32:30.119
AND PLACE THE HEMOSTAT.

32:30.119 --> 32:31.350
THERE.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.123
UH, COULD I BORROW HER
FOR A MOMENT?

32:34.123 --> 32:35.654
YES, BUT NOT FOR LONG,
PLEASE.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.057
(chuckles)

32:38.057 --> 32:40.359
UH, I WOULD LIKE
TO ADMIT ETHAN DAWSON

32:40.359 --> 32:41.960
TO PEDS FOR THE NIGHT.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.132
OH, HE'LL BE FINE
WITH SOCIAL SERVICES.

32:43.132 --> 32:44.393
KIDS GO WITH THEM EVERY DAY.

32:44.393 --> 32:45.494
THIS KID
DOESN'T HAVE TO.

32:45.494 --> 32:47.296
OWEN, THERE'S PROTOCOL
FOR A REASON.

32:47.296 --> 32:49.338
YEAH, BUT WE'RE HUMAN
FOR A REASON.

32:49.338 --> 32:52.101
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TAKEN
A SPECIAL INTEREST IN THIS KID--

32:52.101 --> 32:53.272
WHY IS EVERYBODY ACTING LIKE

32:53.272 --> 32:54.443
THIS IS SOME KIND
OF A CHARACTER FLAW?

32:54.443 --> 32:55.644
HE OUGHT TO STAY.
HE'S SICK.

32:55.644 --> 32:57.376
I GOT A LOOK AT HIM
WHEN I CHECKED HIS WRIST.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.607
SHORT LIMB SYNDROME.

32:58.607 --> 33:00.109
KAREV.

33:00.109 --> 33:01.250
RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.412
UH, LIMITED GROWTH,
EXCESSIVE SLEEPING,

33:03.412 --> 33:05.084
AND EATING.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.315
IMPULSE CONTROL
PROBLEMS.

33:06.315 --> 33:08.287
TH-THESE ARE ALL THE SYMPTOMS
OF CHILDHOOD.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.458
CAN'T BE SURE.

33:09.458 --> 33:10.759
NOT UNTIL WE CONFIRM IT

33:10.759 --> 33:12.491
WITH TESTING AND OBSERVATION.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.064
GUYS, GUYS,
I LOVE THE ENTHUSIASM,

33:15.064 --> 33:17.996
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.998
(sighs)
ALL RIGHT.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.432
(crickets chirping)

33:23.432 --> 33:25.704
(exhales)

33:25.704 --> 33:27.236
HEY.

33:27.236 --> 33:28.707
CRISTINA SAID SHE WOULD
PULL THE TRIGGER

33:28.707 --> 33:30.379
IF IT COMES TO THAT.

33:32.041 --> 33:33.382
YOU'RE MY WIFE.

33:33.382 --> 33:34.683
CAN WE MAKE
THE DECISION TOGETHER

33:34.683 --> 33:36.345
IF WE'RE GONNA
THROW IN THE TOWEL?

33:36.345 --> 33:38.217
THAT SOUNDS FAIR.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.348
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
EASY ON YOU

33:39.348 --> 33:40.619
IF I START TO LOSE IT.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.121
OH, DON'T WORRY.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.293
YOU'RE A PROJECT
EVEN WITH ALL YOUR MARBLES.

33:44.293 --> 33:45.324
(laughs)

33:45.324 --> 33:46.495
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

33:46.495 --> 33:47.656
YOU DID?

33:47.656 --> 33:49.027
I HAD BAILEY DO MY GENOME.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.199
(gasps) YOU DID?

33:50.199 --> 33:51.660
YEAH.

33:51.660 --> 33:54.233
HIGH-RISK FOR LIVER CANCER
AND PROSTATE CANCER? WHOA.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.405
YEAH.
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

33:56.405 --> 33:59.108
MALE PATTERN BALDNESS?

33:59.108 --> 34:00.409
LATE ONSET, APPARENTLY.

34:00.409 --> 34:01.770
MM-HMM.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.372
HEROIN ADDICTION?

34:03.372 --> 34:04.343
I'M A REAL PRIZE.
OHH.

34:04.343 --> 34:05.814
IT'S ALL A CRAPSHOOT.

34:05.814 --> 34:07.346
WE DIDN'T GET
ONE SINGLE DEFINITE.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.547
WE ONLY GOT MAYBES.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.249
AH, MAYBE WE LIVE FOREVER.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.480
MAYBE WE DO,

34:11.480 --> 34:12.821
AND MAYBE I BECOME
A BALD HEROIN ADDICT.

34:12.821 --> 34:14.423

34:14.423 --> 34:17.426

over P.A.)

34:33.372 --> 34:35.844
(woman) HONEY, I'M GONNA GET
THESE BAGS DOWN TO THE CAR.

34:35.844 --> 34:37.846
(Matthew) UH, THANKS, MOM.

34:44.453 --> 34:46.215
(indistinct conversations)

34:46.215 --> 34:48.317
(Richard sighs)

34:48.317 --> 34:50.159
WRAPPING IT UP FOR THE DAY?

34:50.159 --> 34:51.590
YEP.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.263
HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME
BUY YOU DINNER?

34:54.263 --> 34:56.495
I WANT TO BEND YOUR EAR ABOUT
A PROJECT I'M THINKING ABOUT.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.096
YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE

34:58.096 --> 35:00.429
ARE FREE TO SUBMIT
YOUR PROPOSALS IN WRITING

35:00.429 --> 35:01.600
TO THE ENTIRE BOARD.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.272
AND THEN I WILL VOTE
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

35:03.272 --> 35:04.333
HELL, MAYBE I'LL
SUBMIT ONE MYSELF.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.674
MAYBE I HAVE AN IDEA,

35:05.674 --> 35:07.676
BUT I'M NOT OUT HERE
HAWKING IT TO PEOPLE AT WORK.

35:07.676 --> 35:09.438
'CAUSE I'M GONNA WRITE
A PROPOSAL

35:09.438 --> 35:11.310
LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.442
(indistinct conversations
continue)

35:13.442 --> 35:15.744
UM... SON,

35:15.744 --> 35:18.747
NOBODY'S EVER SAYING YES
TO YOUR PROPOSAL.

35:18.747 --> 35:20.749
YOU'RE THE MOST POWERFUL VOTE
ON THE BOARD.

35:20.749 --> 35:23.352
YOU'RE THE PERSON WHO SAYS YES
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS.

35:23.352 --> 35:25.224
WE STILL LET YOU BE
A SURGEON.

35:25.224 --> 35:27.125
NOBODY WANTED
TO TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.799
BUT YOUR PROJECT
IS THIS HOSPITAL.

35:30.799 --> 35:33.602
YEAH,
IT'S EXHAUSTING SOMETIMES.

35:33.602 --> 35:36.465
YEAH.

35:36.465 --> 35:38.237

35:38.237 --> 35:40.909

WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF?

35:40.909 --> 35:42.841
WHAT?

35:42.841 --> 35:44.913
SOMEBODY OFFERS
TO BUY YOU DINNER

35:44.913 --> 35:46.575
WHILE THEY TALK YOUR EAR OFF

35:46.575 --> 35:49.348
ABOUT SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR...

35:51.580 --> 35:53.452
YOU SAY YES.

35:53.452 --> 35:57.186
(laughs) LOOK AT THAT.
YOU'RE A NATURAL.

35:57.186 --> 35:59.358
(sighs)

35:59.358 --> 36:00.359
OH, LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT THIS.

36:00.359 --> 36:01.790
YES, BUT...

36:01.790 --> 36:03.892
NOT AS FAST
AS IT COULD BE.

36:03.892 --> 36:07.336
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.

36:07.336 --> 36:09.198

36:09.198 --> 36:11.700

FOR ALL YOU'VE TAUGHT US.

36:11.700 --> 36:15.504

SHORT LIMB SYNDROME?

36:23.882 --> 36:25.484

YEAH, WE'RE NOT SURE.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.256
AT THIS POINT, WE'RE JUST
ADMITTING HIM FOR OBSERVATION.

36:27.256 --> 36:28.757
WE'LL KNOW MORE
IN THE MORNING.

IS INFECTED.

TO MAKE SOME KIND OF STATEMENT.

OUT THERE ON ITS OWN.

JOYCE BASCHE,

SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

WOULD GET RID OF THE INFECTION,

THAT WE'RE USING
THE RIGHT ANTIBIOTICS

THE ONLY DOCTOR WHO TOUCHED
ALL THREE PATIENTS

40:57.826 --> 40:58.957
WAS YOU.

41:02.931 --> 41:05.794
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO GET LEGAL DOWN HERE.

41:05.794 --> 41:08.897
WAIT. ANY--ANYTHING COULD'VE
CAUSED THIS KIND OF INFECTION.

41:08.897 --> 41:10.869
(Arizona sighs)
YEAH, NO--

41:10.869 --> 41:13.201
WELL, WE KNOW THAT, BUT UNTIL
THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION--

41:13.201 --> 41:15.544
NO, UM, I GOTTA GO,
'CAUSE I HAVE TWO MORE PEOPLE--

41:15.544 --> 41:16.645
(clears throat) OWEN?

41:16.645 --> 41:17.976
DR. WEBBER
WILL DEAL WITH THEM.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.147
YEAH, THIS IS DR. AVERY.

41:19.147 --> 41:20.509
GET ME JOELLE GELLER
FROM LEGAL DOWN HERE,

41:20.509 --> 41:21.610
CONFERENCE ROOM TWO.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.553
I WILL...

41:24.553 --> 41:25.954
GO OVER MY NOTES.

41:25.954 --> 41:27.986
SIT DOWN, DR. BAILEY.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.159
NO. M-MY PATIENTS
ARE IN DANGER.

41:31.159 --> 41:33.792
DR. WEBBER
WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.494
(voice breaking) I HAVEN'T
EVEN TOLD JOYCE'S HUSBAND

41:36.494 --> 41:38.567
THAT SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

41:38.567 --> 41:39.628
(whispers indistinctly)

41:39.628 --> 41:41.029
W--

41:42.831 --> 41:44.533
I KNOW THE MAN!

41:44.533 --> 41:47.706
I DON'T NEED GREY TO TELL HIM
THAT I KILLED HIS WIFE!

41:47.706 --> 41:50.839
DR. BAILEY,
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.982
(breathes heavily)

41:53.982 --> 41:57.145
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
STRAIGHT WITH YOU,

41:57.145 --> 41:58.917
SO BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU ASK FOR

41:58.917 --> 42:00.889
WHEN YOU WALK INTO
A HOSPITAL.

42:00.889 --> 42:03.021
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

42:03.021 --> 42:06.124
(sighs) I'M ASKING YOU
TO SIT DOWN.

42:19.267 --> 42:23.642
BECAUSE WHEN YOU FIND OUT
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON...

42:23.642 --> 42:25.644
YOU MAY NEVER RECOVER.
