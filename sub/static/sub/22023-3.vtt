WEBVTT

00:00.430 --> 00:01.664
So without further ado,

00:02.199 --> 00:03.599
it's my great pleasure

00:03.668 --> 00:06.825
to welcome our newest
part-time employee,

00:06.826 --> 00:08.325
Emma Dubanowski.

00:13.633 --> 00:16.667
That's very nice of you
and also very unnecessary.

00:16.810 --> 00:19.001
Oh, there's more.

00:19.001 --> 00:20.607
14 years ago,

00:20.814 --> 00:24.999
our Cloud 9 family got a little bigger.

00:25.244 --> 00:26.777
- Aww!
- Oh!

00:26.846 --> 00:27.910
Adorable.

00:27.910 --> 00:29.179
- Mom...
- I don't know

00:29.279 --> 00:29.949
how he got those pictures.

00:29.956 --> 00:31.499
Oh, I keep a copy of all the photos

00:31.500 --> 00:33.150
employees get developed here.

00:33.286 --> 00:34.985
- What?
- That's horrifying.

00:35.054 --> 00:36.220
You don't have any of my photos,

00:36.289 --> 00:37.855
because I don't pose for them.

00:37.923 --> 00:39.356
You know, if I ever got kidnapped,

00:39.425 --> 00:40.921
the police would have quite a time

00:40.922 --> 00:43.527
finding a current photo
to put on the news.

00:43.596 --> 00:44.995
Anyway, over the years,

00:45.064 --> 00:48.672
we've watched Amy's daughter Emma grow.

00:50.149 --> 00:52.069
Who could forget the time

00:52.138 --> 00:54.071
that she lost a tooth
right here in the store

00:54.240 --> 00:56.907
and Elias ate it 'cause he
thought it was a Chiclet?

00:56.976 --> 00:58.542
Glenn, you're drifting.

00:58.611 --> 01:01.779
Oh. Okay, well, we'll finish that later.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.986
Anyway, Emma, we are so happy

01:04.986 --> 01:09.572
that you're here, and we hope
you have a great first day!

01:12.277 --> 01:13.309
Emma!

01:15.380 --> 01:17.313
Oh, also, starting today

01:17.649 --> 01:19.482
is Kelly Watson.

01:19.551 --> 01:22.018
Hi, everyone.

01:22.353 --> 01:24.454
I'm really excited to be here.

Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:32.830 --> 01:34.230
Oh, excuse me.

01:34.231 --> 01:35.213
Hi. Um...

01:35.275 --> 01:37.294
is that guy working here today?

01:37.295 --> 01:39.229
Um, I don't know his name,

01:39.230 --> 01:40.897
but he has piercing brown eyes

01:40.966 --> 01:42.154
and an amazing butt?

01:42.155 --> 01:43.700
Scott.

01:43.768 --> 01:45.835
Yeah, he's just fixing
one of the coring rigs.

01:45.904 --> 01:48.805
Okay. Well, thank you.

01:49.941 --> 01:51.045
That's so cool.

01:51.053 --> 01:52.549
You're starting to move on from Jeff.

01:52.627 --> 01:54.243
Oh, I just like flirting with him.

01:54.312 --> 01:55.694
I mean, just because
you're not gonna buy

01:55.695 --> 01:57.337
doesn't mean you can't
check out the merchandise,

01:57.338 --> 01:57.971
right?

01:59.484 --> 02:01.184
- Ew.
- So are you just

02:01.252 --> 02:03.284
gonna stand there till he comes out?

02:03.822 --> 02:05.455
Yeah. I mean, I stand here

02:05.523 --> 02:06.856
or stand over there,
what does it matter?

02:07.351 --> 02:09.378
This whole job is standing places.

02:10.061 --> 02:11.127
Okay.

02:12.074 --> 02:14.964
So... ninth grade.

02:17.718 --> 02:19.284
Fidget spinners, huh?

02:19.361 --> 02:21.144
Hey. Don't distract Jonah.

02:21.656 --> 02:23.215
- I wasn't.
- We were just gabbing.

02:23.216 --> 02:24.940
Go collect the clothes
from the dressing rooms,

02:24.941 --> 02:26.626
then fold them, hang them,
put them on the racks,

02:26.695 --> 02:28.227
and I'll come show you
how to scrub down the bathrooms.

02:28.296 --> 02:29.929
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

02:29.998 --> 02:31.130
Lose the attitude. Go.

02:33.134 --> 02:35.087
Wow. Pretty tough on her.

02:35.142 --> 02:37.470
I feel like I barely did
anything my first day.

02:37.539 --> 02:39.472
- Yeah, we all felt that way.
- Hmm.

02:39.541 --> 02:41.274
She just has such an attitude
since the divorce.

02:41.343 --> 02:42.742
That's why I'm making her work here.

02:42.811 --> 02:44.243
I'm hoping she gets some discipline.

02:44.312 --> 02:46.079
And you're not worried

02:46.147 --> 02:48.614
that if you're too hard on her,
Adam gets to be the good guy?

02:48.683 --> 02:50.083
What? No.

02:50.151 --> 02:51.651
It's just that when
my parents separated,

02:51.720 --> 02:53.152
they both wanted to be the favorite.

02:53.221 --> 02:54.854
I came home one day
and my dad had gotten me

02:54.923 --> 02:57.557
a ten-disc box set
of Churchill speeches.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.713
And that was something you wanted?

02:59.799 --> 03:01.627
Uh, yeah.

03:02.554 --> 03:04.454
I'm still closer with him
than I am with my mom.

03:05.057 --> 03:07.257
Although that might be
because he doesn't send me

03:07.325 --> 03:08.961
long, pointless texts about book club.

03:08.962 --> 03:11.109
Yeah, see, Latino parents are different.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.184
We don't really need
our kids to like us.

03:13.185 --> 03:16.032
We just break their spirit
so the world doesn't.

03:16.034 --> 03:16.369
Huh.

03:16.740 --> 03:19.395
And why... why do you pierce
your babies' ears so earl...

03:19.396 --> 03:21.370
I am not on a panel.
This is not "ask a Latina."

03:21.473 --> 03:23.576
Got it. I'll just find out on Reddit.

03:32.397 --> 03:33.183
Hey, listen.

03:33.252 --> 03:34.851
I know we haven't been
having sex recently,

03:34.920 --> 03:36.886
so I thought I should
explain what's going on.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.922
Dina, I'm with a customer right now.

03:38.991 --> 03:41.091
Oh. I'm sorry.

03:41.226 --> 03:42.792
Step back, please.
Can I just put this...

03:42.861 --> 03:43.899
Step back.

03:44.946 --> 03:46.111
There. Happy?

03:46.180 --> 03:47.446
- Mm.
- Anyway,

03:47.515 --> 03:49.515
I have been experiencing

03:49.584 --> 03:51.622
some anxiety recently, and...

03:51.922 --> 03:53.169
please don't spread this around,

03:53.170 --> 03:55.254
but I've started going to a shrink.

03:55.323 --> 03:57.556
Actually, two shrinks. One's a control.

03:57.558 --> 03:58.681
Long story short,

03:59.193 --> 04:00.926
I've been dealing
with some personal crap.

04:00.995 --> 04:02.928
Okay. Well, um,

04:02.997 --> 04:04.930
maybe we just take a little break.

04:04.999 --> 04:06.799
Let you work on you.

04:06.868 --> 04:07.267
Oh.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.108
Yeah, that would probably be good.

04:09.109 --> 04:11.291
At least until I get my head together.

04:12.573 --> 04:14.975
We can't take that back if it's broken.

04:17.511 --> 04:19.814
Um... hi, sorry.

04:19.815 --> 04:23.686
I-I'm a rookie, or a newb.

04:23.874 --> 04:25.184
I don't know what we call it here.

04:25.186 --> 04:26.585
Anyway, um,

04:26.654 --> 04:28.587
no one has told me exactly

04:28.656 --> 04:29.889
what I should be doing.

04:29.957 --> 04:31.223
Okay, I just really don't have time

04:31.292 --> 04:32.591
to hold your hand right now,

04:32.660 --> 04:34.825
so just go zone softlines or something.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.796
Okay, but when you say "zone"

04:37.906 --> 04:39.911
and also when you say "softlines"...

04:39.912 --> 04:41.374
Ugh! Okay, you are impossible.

04:41.443 --> 04:42.875
Just go away. Go away.

04:42.944 --> 04:44.677
- Oh.
- Go.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.345
Uh-oh.

04:46.414 --> 04:47.680
Beam me up, Scotty!

04:50.618 --> 04:53.553
Okay. So flip, flip, voilÃ . Got it?

04:54.155 --> 04:55.388
Hey!

04:55.457 --> 04:57.323
Pay attention. Who are you texting?

04:57.392 --> 04:59.659
Relax. It's just Dad.

05:01.162 --> 05:03.596
Okay, it's flip...

05:04.488 --> 05:06.032
So what were you and
your dad texting about?

05:06.501 --> 05:08.808
Uh, inside joke. You wouldn't get it.

05:09.471 --> 05:12.638
Wow. Since when do you have
inside jokes with your dad?

05:12.707 --> 05:15.007
It was just something
that happened at Six Flags.

05:15.076 --> 05:16.109
Oh!

05:16.177 --> 05:17.844
You guys went to Six Flags.

05:17.912 --> 05:20.980
Fun. Cool, cool, cool.

05:21.291 --> 05:23.328
Um, is... is this right?

05:23.515 --> 05:25.602
No. So look, I was thinking maybe,

05:26.346 --> 05:28.018
I don't know, we could go see

05:28.019 --> 05:30.108
that horror film you want
tomorrow night?

05:30.109 --> 05:31.616
I mean, I know I said
you were too young,

05:31.685 --> 05:32.899
but, eh...

05:32.900 --> 05:35.320
I can't. Um, I'm seeing
Twenty One Pilots

05:35.388 --> 05:37.119
in concert tomorrow with Dad.

05:37.791 --> 05:38.505
Oh.

05:38.898 --> 05:40.331
So many activities.

05:43.638 --> 05:46.038
So apparently, Emma loves her dad now.

05:46.829 --> 05:48.954
That's... terrible?

05:49.006 --> 05:51.236
No, I mean, obviously,
I want her to love her dad,

05:51.304 --> 05:52.804
but she's been pushing me away,

05:52.873 --> 05:54.213
and all of a sudden,
they're like besties.

05:54.214 --> 05:55.840
I thought Latinos don't care
if their kids like them.

05:55.909 --> 05:57.141
I really think you're painting

05:57.210 --> 05:58.476
with too broad a cultural brush here.

05:58.545 --> 05:59.944
- No, that was...
- First, it's that

06:00.013 --> 06:01.446
he's more fun, then she's gonna want

06:01.515 --> 06:02.671
to live with him,
and before you know it,

06:02.672 --> 06:04.408
it's, "Sorry, Mom, can't
make it to your birthday party."

06:04.409 --> 06:06.759
I'm too busy listening to
Churchill speeches with Dad."

06:06.806 --> 06:08.920
Oh, that would be a crazy coincidence.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.205
I don't know. Maybe I...

06:11.206 --> 06:13.009
maybe I should be a little
less strict with her,

06:13.010 --> 06:14.474
at least until I'm number one again.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.576
You're an intense mom.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.644
I do not want to be around
when Emma starts dating.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.247
Why would you even mention that?

06:26.763 --> 06:30.622
Oh, yeah, that's what we heard.

06:30.921 --> 06:32.050
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:34.278 --> 06:35.377
Hey.

06:35.446 --> 06:37.768
Hey... Garrett.

06:38.002 --> 06:39.815
How's it going, big guy?

06:39.884 --> 06:40.766
I'm fine.

06:41.016 --> 06:43.532
Listen, some of us
get together on Thursdays

06:43.533 --> 06:44.923
and do a little wine club thing.

06:45.001 --> 06:46.448
You could join us if you want.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.975
Why would I do that?

06:48.756 --> 06:51.030
Well, you know, 'cause of what happened.

06:52.126 --> 06:53.542
With you and Dina.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.648
How she dumped you.

06:56.654 --> 06:57.050
What?

06:57.152 --> 06:59.520
You are going to find someone so great.

07:00.199 --> 07:01.599
I don't know what you guys heard,

07:01.667 --> 07:04.969
but I did not get dumped. It was mutual.

07:05.037 --> 07:06.704
No.

07:06.772 --> 07:09.173
- It's never mutual.
- It's never mutual.

07:09.242 --> 07:11.075
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.010
I know it's not Six Flags,

07:13.079 --> 07:15.346
but go-backs can be fun.

07:16.122 --> 07:17.982
âª I like to go back, go back âª

07:18.050 --> 07:19.683
âª I like to... go back! âª

07:20.189 --> 07:22.022
âª I like to go back, go back âª

07:22.091 --> 07:23.958
âª I like to go back âª

07:24.026 --> 07:26.427
I like the enthusiasm!

07:26.495 --> 07:27.853
âª I like to go back âª

07:27.854 --> 07:29.463
âª I like to go back âª

07:29.532 --> 07:32.766
âª I like to go back, I like to go back âª

07:32.835 --> 07:34.501
âª Go way back, back âª

07:34.570 --> 07:36.637
So how's school? What's going on?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.205
What's the hot goss?

07:38.274 --> 07:39.257
"Hot goss"?

07:39.258 --> 07:41.308
You know what I mean.
Come on, spill it, girl.

07:41.849 --> 07:42.720
Excuse me. You were gonna check to see

07:42.721 --> 07:44.315
if you had any floor cleaner
in the back?

07:44.316 --> 07:46.613
- Oh, yeah, sorry, I forgot.
- You forgot?

07:46.832 --> 07:48.460
Listen, if you don't feel
like doing something,

07:48.461 --> 07:49.578
don't waste my time.

07:49.579 --> 07:50.795
Excuse me, sir.

07:50.802 --> 07:53.683
- You need to back off. She is 14.
- Yeah, well...

07:53.684 --> 07:55.676
Also, you're upset about floor cleaner.

07:55.677 --> 07:57.637
Who even uses floor cleaner anymore?

07:57.638 --> 07:59.720
What are you, an orderly from the '50s?

07:59.885 --> 08:01.086
- No.
- No.

08:01.087 --> 08:02.284
Right. So go away.

08:05.446 --> 08:06.218
Wow.

08:07.285 --> 08:08.384
That was awesome.

08:08.876 --> 08:10.088
I can be awesome.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.408
Stop, no, it's hideous.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.652
No, no, I'm serious.

08:14.653 --> 08:16.456
Not everyone can pull off a vest.

08:16.457 --> 08:17.844
Oh, believe me, I know.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.519
I work here.

08:20.588 --> 08:21.373
I gotta run.

08:21.788 --> 08:23.260
Uh, my break's almost over.

08:23.261 --> 08:24.727
Hey, actually,

08:24.728 --> 08:25.749
do you think it'd be cool

08:25.765 --> 08:28.770
if I borrowed your badge
to use the employee bathroom?

08:28.771 --> 08:30.796
I mean, we have porta-potties,

08:30.865 --> 08:32.698
but, uh, you know, kinda gross, so...

08:32.765 --> 08:34.302
Uh, yeah, yeah.

08:34.303 --> 08:36.184
Of course. Not a problem at all.

08:36.937 --> 08:37.839
Just go to town.

08:37.839 --> 08:38.600
Thanks.

08:39.392 --> 08:40.178
You're the best.

08:44.510 --> 08:45.610
It's happening!

08:46.651 --> 08:47.672
Uh-huh.

08:48.234 --> 08:49.569
Uh, okay.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.391
What is that supposed to mean?

08:51.673 --> 08:55.975
Just that... you know, sometimes
people flirt with people to get stuff.

08:55.976 --> 08:58.724
Like, there's this cashier
at the Steak 'n Shake

08:58.792 --> 09:01.062
who always gives me free
fries when I wear shorts.

09:01.063 --> 09:03.613
Yeah, well, that's not
what's happening here, so...

09:03.614 --> 09:05.225
- Okay.
- You can tell by his eyes.

09:05.226 --> 09:06.589
- Okay.
- You don't know him.

09:06.590 --> 09:08.590
I'm sorry. You're right, I don't.

09:08.771 --> 09:10.003
Yeah.

09:12.232 --> 09:13.339
Hey, Dina.

09:14.081 --> 09:15.870
Ninja Turtles are still a thing, huh?

09:16.027 --> 09:17.852
No wonder this country's a garbage fire.

09:17.853 --> 09:20.037
Hey, why did you tell Justine
that you broke up with me?

09:20.038 --> 09:21.937
Because she asked me,
"What's new with you,"

09:21.938 --> 09:22.762
and so I told her.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.583
One of my birds has pinkeye,
I broke up with you,

09:24.584 --> 09:25.906
and I just signed up for golf lessons.

09:25.907 --> 09:27.937
Okay, but you didn't break up with me.

09:27.938 --> 09:30.270
It was mutual, and if
anything, I suggested it.

09:30.271 --> 09:32.155
But I took you up on it.
If you had suggested it

09:32.156 --> 09:33.979
and I said, "No, I don't want that,"

09:33.986 --> 09:35.377
would we still be sleeping together?

09:35.378 --> 09:37.695
I-I don't know. I guess, but...

09:37.696 --> 09:39.398
Well, there you go, champ.

09:43.239 --> 09:44.689
Hey. Hi.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.121
I'm sorry. Do you know
what a softline is?

09:47.122 --> 09:48.721
I don't have time for this.

09:50.010 --> 09:50.953
Excuse me.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.646
Do you know what a softline is?

09:52.647 --> 09:54.583
I don't live here. I'm from Tampa.

09:57.269 --> 09:58.936
Haley's dating a junior.

09:59.738 --> 10:00.222
Huh?

10:00.315 --> 10:01.897
I mean, it's not really

10:02.069 --> 10:03.405
"hot goss," but...

10:03.741 --> 10:05.728
she doesn't sit with us
at lunch anymore,

10:05.729 --> 10:07.726
and she goes off campus with Connor.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.288
Wow.

10:09.928 --> 10:13.128
And, um, how does your
dad feel about that?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.965
Oh, I haven't told him.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.133
Nice.

10:16.201 --> 10:19.002
Oh, uh, no, you're not done.

10:19.071 --> 10:21.215
The floor's so dirty,
how can you even tell?

10:21.216 --> 10:24.475
Well, because the floor
is still slippery.

10:25.787 --> 10:26.946
Okay. Fine.

10:30.135 --> 10:31.528
Actually, you know what?

10:32.043 --> 10:34.286
It'd be kind of punk rock
if we just left it.

10:34.727 --> 10:36.566
How about you and I go get a soda?

10:37.031 --> 10:38.908
- Come on.
- Okay.

10:38.909 --> 10:41.383
Slippery floors, that could be
our little inside thing.

10:41.385 --> 10:42.312
Like how?

10:44.730 --> 10:47.731
Like, I could text you

10:47.799 --> 10:50.066
the banana emoji, and you would
know what I was talking about.

10:50.135 --> 10:51.368
- Huh?
- Sure.

10:52.189 --> 10:54.390
So now Justine might have
to get her jaw wired shut.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.059
You see, this is what happens

10:56.127 --> 10:58.141
when you try to be
friends with your kid.

10:58.143 --> 10:59.276
She could be zoning,

10:59.344 --> 11:00.810
she could be cleaning, but no.

11:00.879 --> 11:02.197
She's just standing there.

11:02.198 --> 11:03.830
Do you think any of this
might be stemming

11:03.854 --> 11:04.714
from the fact that you feel

11:04.783 --> 11:06.216
like you're losing control of...

11:06.285 --> 11:07.484
See, this is how it starts.

11:07.964 --> 11:09.631
First, she's texting at work.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.766
And then she's not doing her homework.

11:11.835 --> 11:14.035
And then she's hanging out
with the bad kids.

11:14.104 --> 11:16.071
And before you know it, she's pregnant

11:16.139 --> 11:19.207
and addicted to pills
and dancing for strangers.

11:19.284 --> 11:21.976
Oh, those were...
those are really bad kids.

11:22.045 --> 11:23.044
You want me to, uh...

11:23.113 --> 11:24.612
want me to go yell at her?

11:25.327 --> 11:27.882
Yes. Actually, yeah.
that would be great.

11:27.951 --> 11:29.786
Oh, no, no, no, no. I was just kidding.

11:29.786 --> 11:31.386
I never yell. Even when I'm mad,

11:31.388 --> 11:33.471
I just push it down really deep,

11:33.565 --> 11:35.850
and then sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night,

11:35.851 --> 11:37.792
panicked and sweaty for no reason.

11:39.937 --> 11:42.997
Oh. I'm, like, obsessed with the gym.

11:43.066 --> 11:45.845
I live there. I'm really into, like,

11:47.477 --> 11:51.081
core stuff and just
all sports in general.

11:51.081 --> 11:52.880
I mean, whatever you're doing,

11:54.084 --> 11:55.213
it's... It's working.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.112
Oh.

11:56.113 --> 11:59.481
Hey, um, you think I could get
that badge for the bathroom again?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.510
Oh. Oof. Um. You know what?

12:03.869 --> 12:05.802
I would love to, um,

12:06.104 --> 12:08.371
but I could actually get
into trouble with my boss.

12:08.732 --> 12:09.545
Oh.

12:09.758 --> 12:11.091
Yeah, I mean,

12:11.409 --> 12:13.857
I am a bad boy, but not that way.

12:15.413 --> 12:16.716
Sure. I'll just, uh...

12:18.400 --> 12:19.549
use the porta-potty, then.

12:20.222 --> 12:22.229
Okay, well, don't take too long.

12:22.433 --> 12:24.654
We haven't even traded
stretching tips yet.

12:29.279 --> 12:30.393
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hey, listen,

12:30.462 --> 12:31.978
I'm sorry about before.

12:32.034 --> 12:33.163
I hadn't eaten anything, and, uh,

12:33.231 --> 12:34.564
I got a weird call from my wife.

12:34.633 --> 12:35.959
Okay, let me stop you right there.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.101
I was wrong for yelling at you earlier.

12:38.169 --> 12:40.111
That girl, she messed up,

12:40.376 --> 12:42.285
and the only way she's gonna
learn how to do her job right

12:42.286 --> 12:44.666
is if customers yell at her.

12:44.735 --> 12:45.285
Okay.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.638
So if you wanted to, like,

12:46.639 --> 12:48.637
go over there and really give it to her,

12:48.705 --> 12:49.838
that would be fine.

12:49.907 --> 12:51.555
I mean, like, don't hold back.

12:51.556 --> 12:52.774
Obviously, don't hit her,

12:52.775 --> 12:54.609
but if you wanted to shake her a little,

12:54.678 --> 12:56.011
that would be cool.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.439
I'm not gonna shake a little girl.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.215
No, no, I'm her mom.
I'm not gonna report it.

13:04.972 --> 13:05.744
Little tip:

13:05.963 --> 13:08.833
it works better if you scan
from, like, six inches away.

13:09.207 --> 13:10.202
Oh, okay.

13:10.203 --> 13:11.242
Thank you.

13:11.648 --> 13:14.382
You're, like, the only person
who's actually helped me.

13:14.451 --> 13:16.218
Oh, aren't you sweet?

13:16.738 --> 13:18.487
I think we're gonna be good friends.

13:18.555 --> 13:19.621
I hope so.

13:19.690 --> 13:20.956
Wanna hear a secret?

13:21.024 --> 13:22.174
Sure.

13:22.175 --> 13:23.908
I have a plan to get Jerry back.

13:24.435 --> 13:25.367
I'm sorry. I don't know who...

13:25.436 --> 13:26.344
Sandra's boyfriend.

13:26.345 --> 13:28.818
Well, my boyfriend
that she stole from me.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.088
He's in a coma, but I'm going to sneak

13:31.089 --> 13:33.129
into his hospital room
when she's not there.

13:33.197 --> 13:35.391
I climb up on the bed, and oopsy!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.723
I forgot my underwear.

13:37.011 --> 13:39.677
Next thing you know,
I'm pregnant with Jerry's baby.

13:40.938 --> 13:41.871
Now, stay with me,

13:41.872 --> 13:44.173
because this is where
it starts to get a little dark.

13:44.242 --> 13:45.060
That's okay.

13:45.161 --> 13:45.976
You don't want to hear the rest?

13:45.976 --> 13:46.805
No, I'm cool.

13:50.805 --> 13:53.272
Oh, uh, no,
the tuna goes one aisle over.

13:53.341 --> 13:56.375
It's, uh... it's not a bean product.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.437
It's a can.

13:58.279 --> 14:00.412
Sure, yeah, yeah, it's a can,

14:00.481 --> 14:02.014
yeah, but, um, you know,

14:02.083 --> 14:03.816
we don't really organize
things here by shape.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.051
So it's not like the cans go over here

14:06.120 --> 14:08.420
and the boxes go over there.

14:08.489 --> 14:09.722
Whatever.

14:09.790 --> 14:12.191
N-no, not... no. No!

14:12.259 --> 14:13.692
Not whatever, okay...

14:13.761 --> 14:15.527
Missy, and you know what?

14:15.814 --> 14:17.295
You got to put that phone away too.

14:17.343 --> 14:18.252
You're not my boss.

14:18.254 --> 14:21.221
Yeah, I'm... Well, I'm the grown-up.

14:21.302 --> 14:22.701
- Hey!
- You're not getting paid

14:22.770 --> 14:25.098
to gossip with your little
girlfriends, okay?

14:25.145 --> 14:27.313
So get back to work,
or your ass is grass,

14:27.314 --> 14:28.973
and I'm... I'm the... lawn mower.

14:28.973 --> 14:29.909
Jonah!

14:29.910 --> 14:32.817
What... what is wrong with you?
She's a child!

14:32.885 --> 14:34.914
- Right, but she...
- You know, I am appalled!

14:34.915 --> 14:36.481
- You stay away from her.
- Okay, okay, Glenn

14:36.548 --> 14:38.636
Oh, oh, oh, you can dish it out,

14:38.638 --> 14:40.985
- but you can't take it! Huh? Huh?
- You don't understand.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.821
Well, I'm the one who's yelling now!

14:42.889 --> 14:44.923
Okay? How you like that, mister?

14:44.991 --> 14:45.890
I don't... I don't...

14:45.891 --> 14:47.463
Not so hot, huh?

14:48.128 --> 14:48.946
Huh?

14:55.113 --> 14:55.600
Let me help you.

14:56.104 --> 14:56.978
I can do it.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.305
Come on, come on, hey, hey.
Don't be a hero.

14:59.374 --> 15:00.907
Come on. I got it. I got it.

15:05.641 --> 15:06.746
Can I ask you something?

15:06.814 --> 15:09.048
You can't use my bathroom pass.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.349
Bathroom pass?

15:10.418 --> 15:12.852
Oh, is that not what you were gonna...

15:13.553 --> 15:14.342
Go ahead.

15:16.187 --> 15:17.256
What are you doing here?

15:17.325 --> 15:20.159
You seem like you are way
too pretty to be working here.

15:20.228 --> 15:21.210
Come on.

15:22.597 --> 15:24.764
Shut up. No, I'm not.

15:24.832 --> 15:26.632
You have a nice smile.

15:26.701 --> 15:28.301
What?

15:28.369 --> 15:29.835
What are you even saying?

15:29.904 --> 15:32.238
You... you have a nice smile.

15:32.307 --> 15:37.243
Thanks. Oh, sh... my shirt is soaked.

15:37.612 --> 15:42.187
O... Kay, what?

15:44.942 --> 15:45.557
Hey, man.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.711
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

15:55.860 --> 15:56.805
It's kinda personal.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.367
Yeah, sure, sure.

15:59.196 --> 16:00.949
Okay, well, first of all,
you need to calm down.

16:00.950 --> 16:03.027
I'm calm. Calm. Just, you know,

16:03.058 --> 16:05.253
my roomie's coming to me
for a little heart-to-heart.

16:05.254 --> 16:06.996
It's, uh... it's a good day.

16:07.619 --> 16:09.153
It's a really... it's a really good day.

16:09.154 --> 16:10.627
Basically, Dina and I

16:10.635 --> 16:12.670
decided together to break up.

16:12.671 --> 16:13.900
And now she's going around,

16:14.016 --> 16:15.449
she's telling everybody
that she dumped me...

16:15.516 --> 16:16.663
- Oh.
- Which is not true.

16:16.665 --> 16:17.420
- Oh. Okay.
- It was mutual.

16:17.442 --> 16:19.009
Can you stop active listening?

16:19.010 --> 16:20.426
Oh, yes, sorry, continue.

16:20.942 --> 16:21.895
And I feel

16:21.901 --> 16:23.659
like I want to let everyone know,

16:23.674 --> 16:25.540
but Dina's in a rough place,

16:25.541 --> 16:27.914
and I don't want it to look like
I'm kicking her when she's down.

16:27.915 --> 16:30.391
Got it, okay, so... unh.
Let's unpack this.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.020
Uh, it sounds to me
like you're looking for a way

16:33.021 --> 16:36.162
to let everybody know what
happened with you and Dina

16:36.232 --> 16:39.343
without it reflecting poorly on you.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.036
That's exactly what I just said.

16:42.104 --> 16:45.539
Okay. That's a toughie.
That is a tough, tough toughie.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.274
Okay, this isn't gonna work.

16:47.343 --> 16:49.332
Wait, no, no, no, no! I can do better.

16:49.349 --> 16:51.082
Let me... Give me a do-over.

16:51.151 --> 16:53.584
Come back. I'll pretend
like this didn't happen.

16:56.921 --> 16:57.780
All right.

16:57.781 --> 16:59.822
I, uh... I messed up before. I'm sorry.

16:59.891 --> 17:01.958
I-I was listening,

17:02.027 --> 17:04.227
but I wasn't really hearing.

17:04.296 --> 17:06.086
So here's what we're gonna do.

17:06.117 --> 17:09.435
Tonight, gonna pop open
a couple brewskis,

17:09.436 --> 17:11.968
we're gonna get ourselves
a nice pie... pizza pie,

17:12.037 --> 17:14.069
not pecan or whatever...

17:14.498 --> 17:16.242
and we are gonna watch ourselves

17:16.242 --> 17:18.729
a little movie called "Bad Boys 2"

17:18.729 --> 17:20.835
and get you through
this breakup thing roomie-style.

17:20.904 --> 17:21.556
Hmm.

17:23.154 --> 17:24.652
All right. That's enough.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.474
Attention, Cloud 9 employees!

17:27.856 --> 17:29.310
I am fine.

17:29.379 --> 17:31.346
Dina did not break up with me,

17:31.671 --> 17:34.905
and actually, if you want
to get real about it,

17:35.001 --> 17:36.384
it was my idea.

17:36.453 --> 17:38.053
I was trying to be a nice guy.

17:38.121 --> 17:39.954
- If you could just...
- I got this.

17:40.023 --> 17:42.019
So if you want to feel bad for somebody,

17:42.067 --> 17:43.107
feel bad for Dina,

17:43.108 --> 17:45.026
'cause she's the one seeing the shrink.

17:45.095 --> 17:45.949
Whoa.

17:48.588 --> 17:51.585
That... was something
I shouldn't have said.

17:52.135 --> 17:53.668
Sorry about that.

17:53.737 --> 17:55.403
Please pretend you didn't hear that.

17:55.472 --> 17:57.072
Have a good day.

17:58.775 --> 18:01.281
I'm gonna just put these back.

18:05.349 --> 18:07.415
Oh, hey, is this where Justine fell?

18:07.484 --> 18:08.188
Yeah.

18:09.152 --> 18:12.654
I gotta write it up for
her workman's comp claim.

18:12.723 --> 18:14.489
She says the floor was slippery,

18:14.558 --> 18:16.991
but you know Justine. Glug, glug, glug!

18:18.528 --> 18:20.562
- Hey, Glenn.
- Mm-hmm?

18:23.325 --> 18:26.267
Do you think Emma's doing okay?

18:26.619 --> 18:29.671
Emma? She's a delight. Why?

18:29.740 --> 18:31.364
I don't know. I just...

18:31.942 --> 18:34.709
Ever since the split with
Adam, I just feel like

18:34.778 --> 18:36.444
everything I do is screwing her up,

18:36.513 --> 18:37.946
or maybe I've already screwed her up

18:38.014 --> 18:40.915
and it's too late, but
she talks back to me,

18:40.984 --> 18:43.451
she sometimes wears a lot of eyeliner

18:43.520 --> 18:44.786
and I don't know what that means.

18:44.855 --> 18:46.588
I just feel like I'm losing control.

18:46.656 --> 18:48.690
Amy, can I ask you something

18:48.759 --> 18:51.059
but without you taking it the wrong way?

18:51.161 --> 18:52.260
Sure.

18:52.844 --> 18:53.820
Are you stupid?

18:55.632 --> 18:58.404
- Um...
- She's a teenager.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.803
Yeah, no, I know.
I know she's a teenager.

19:01.872 --> 19:03.238
But it's just... it's more than that.

19:03.306 --> 19:05.740
She's secretive. She's distant.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.909
She doesn't listen
to anything I say anymore...

19:07.978 --> 19:10.346
Oh my, God, I am stupid.
She's a teenager.

19:11.982 --> 19:13.448
Thank you.

19:14.088 --> 19:15.417
Anytime.

19:15.485 --> 19:16.651
I can go back to yelling at her.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.084
Mm-hmm. Fun.

19:20.496 --> 19:22.263
When he smiles at you,

19:22.809 --> 19:24.893
it feels like the sun is coming up.

19:24.961 --> 19:26.561
You know, I'm not even mad.

19:26.630 --> 19:28.229
I got to flirt with a cute guy.

19:28.298 --> 19:30.131
That's the first time
that's happened since Jeff.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.149
Well, Scott is way cuter than Jeff.

19:32.282 --> 19:33.117
Bo's a troll!

19:34.871 --> 19:37.605
I'm sorry. Love you.

19:37.674 --> 19:39.474
- I don't want to force you.
- Oh.

19:39.543 --> 19:41.568
- Just be careful.
- All right.

19:41.569 --> 19:43.921
You wouldn't want it to get... lost.

19:44.347 --> 19:45.447
Oops.

19:45.515 --> 19:46.325
Oh.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.518
Why does he have to go
to the bathroom so much?

19:50.587 --> 19:52.239
I don't know.

19:55.425 --> 19:56.581
Hey, uh,

19:57.573 --> 19:59.583
I'm sorry about the whole
intercom thing.

19:59.584 --> 20:02.103
I got carried away, and...
it wasn't cool.

20:02.579 --> 20:04.029
It's okay. Um...

20:04.193 --> 20:06.176
maybe we both cared more
about this thing between us

20:06.177 --> 20:07.475
than we wanted to admit.

20:07.678 --> 20:08.994
It is possible, yeah.

20:09.159 --> 20:12.239
And maybe what I actually need
as I'm processing this tornado stuff

20:12.240 --> 20:15.297
is not to be alone but
to have some support.

20:16.553 --> 20:19.060
Are you saying you want
to get back together?

20:19.707 --> 20:22.164
I mean, is that crazy?

20:23.528 --> 20:25.546
I don't think so. Let's do it.

20:26.466 --> 20:27.458
Okay.

20:29.639 --> 20:31.798
Yeah, this isn't working out.
I'm dumping you.

20:31.799 --> 20:34.117
- What?
- You're dumped. Unambiguous.

20:34.118 --> 20:36.577
Sir, did you just see that I dumped him?

20:37.914 --> 20:39.202
Attention, Cloud 9 employees.

20:39.203 --> 20:40.845
We have a nonverbal confirmation

20:40.846 --> 20:42.118
I dumped Garrett.

20:42.119 --> 20:43.849
You're a monster.

20:43.850 --> 20:44.993
Enjoy wine club.

20:48.923 --> 20:50.638
Hey, Kelly!

20:50.867 --> 20:53.468
I wanted to say good job today.

20:53.662 --> 20:54.889
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:54.890 --> 20:56.490
I felt a little lost.

20:56.545 --> 20:59.924
I mean, I'm not even totally
sure what go-backs are.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.396
You did great.

21:01.990 --> 21:03.571
Wow. I'm... I'm glad to hear that.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.253
Yeah. Just, tomorrow,

21:05.254 --> 21:06.669
try and remember to clock in,

21:06.670 --> 21:08.609
'cause that way, you'll get paid.

21:08.678 --> 21:10.296
But, you know, great dry run.

21:11.499 --> 21:13.054
Oh, nobody told me I needed to clock in.

21:13.055 --> 21:14.544
Good night!
