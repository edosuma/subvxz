WEBVTT

00:04.880 --> 00:07.320
<i>They are back, from the brink.</i>

00:08.520 --> 00:10.920
<i>The club that they've</i>
<i>loved since children.</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:12.480
<i>Wilfried Zaha!</i>

00:14.200 --> 00:16.480
<i>That is magical.</i>
<i>Simply magical.</i>

00:16.920 --> 00:18.600
<i>Top of the championship!</i>

00:18.720 --> 00:20.720
<i>Cannot believe what</i>
<i>Crystal Palace have done.</i>

00:20.800 --> 00:23.040
<i>Back from the brink of oblivion.</i>

00:23.120 --> 00:25.520
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage.</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:29.280
<i>That will always be etched</i>
<i>in Crystal Palace history.</i>

00:37.760 --> 00:39.200
<i>Dikgacoi!</i>

00:39.280 --> 00:42.160
If we didn't win that game,
it would've been, for nothing.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.240
<i>Zaha! Oh yes!</i>

00:44.960 --> 00:46.440
That final at Wembley that,

00:46.520 --> 00:48.280
that that was the match
that we needed to win.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.040
<i>Wilfred Zaha,</i>

00:50.120 --> 00:53.560
<i>single handedly,</i>
<i>firing Palace to Wembley!</i>

00:56.280 --> 00:58.440
<i>In the biggest match,</i>
<i>on the biggest stage!</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:13.720
Ending up in the playoffs,

01:14.200 --> 01:16.040
I was the perfect
man for the job.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.120
<i>Ian was incredible,</i>
<i>it was like a different person.</i>

01:19.200 --> 01:22.040
It was like, he had metamorphosized
into somebody else.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.440
I asked him if the players should
go on holiday, he said to me

01:25.520 --> 01:27.320
"If you go on holiday
and you've got the sand

01:27.400 --> 01:28.600
between your toes,

01:28.680 --> 01:30.280
you think that's the
end of the season,

01:30.360 --> 01:33.000
you can't get yourself back up
for playing after that,"

01:33.080 --> 01:34.800
<i>He got all of the media</i>
<i>out the way,</i>

01:34.880 --> 01:36.400
<i>he got the suits out the way,</i>

01:36.480 --> 01:40.240
<i>and treat it like another big day,</i>
<i>but day at the office.</i>

01:40.320 --> 01:41.960
I think it made everyone
a bit more at ease.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.160
He told us how to get
organized and prepared

01:44.600 --> 01:46.440
and, I think from us
as a playing group,

01:46.520 --> 01:48.240
<i>and the club, and, you know</i>

01:48.320 --> 01:50.680
<i>with regards to tickets,</i>
<i>busses, and hotels and whatnot.</i>

01:50.760 --> 01:53.440
<i>So it seemed, quite seamless.</i>

01:53.520 --> 01:56.040
The build-up, never
seen something like that.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.600
And I think it's a bit
too long to be fair.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.040
I think, you want to
play straight away.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.360
It's a tough moment
because you know

02:01.440 --> 02:03.160
that you need to go
there, and perform.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.440
When he first came through the door
I got a good feeling, I thought,

02:05.520 --> 02:08.280
"Right, he's been here before,
he knows how to get over the line."

02:08.360 --> 02:10.920
And he came into his own, those playoff
games, he really did.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.920
Yeah, we leant on Ian
quite a lot, really.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.760
In those playoff games,
particularly the final.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.520
We'd have the lads in,

02:17.600 --> 02:19.440
train for two days
and they'd have two days off,

02:19.520 --> 02:23.160
you know they understood
the tactical requirements from Ian,

02:23.240 --> 02:25.400
but also not sort of getting
to that final

02:25.480 --> 02:26.920
where they're fatigued through

02:27.000 --> 02:29.160
just the whole build-up
and the two weeks of it.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.080
He knew exactly
what he wanted to do.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.000
He knew exactly how to sort out tickets,
hospitality, families, travel,

02:36.080 --> 02:38.320
<i>everything, was like, spot on.</i>

02:38.400 --> 02:40.040
<i>He didn't miss a beat on it.</i>

02:40.120 --> 02:42.160
We knew exactly
what the job was in hand.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.880
<i>It's a wonderful day</i>
<i>for everybody,</i>

02:44.960 --> 02:47.960
<i>but we hold everybody's hopes</i>
<i>and dreams in our hands so,</i>

02:48.040 --> 02:49.120
<i>we've got to make</i>
<i>sure we perform.</i>

02:49.680 --> 02:52.920
And it will be a magnificent achievement
for everybody

02:53.000 --> 02:54.040
at Crystal Palace,

02:55.120 --> 02:57.000
but particularly this group

02:57.080 --> 02:59.200
whose manager was changed
halfway through the season.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.480
They didn't ask for that.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.880
<i>You probably couldn't got.</i>

03:01.960 --> 03:06.640
<i>So two opposite poles of football,</i>
<i>and really,</i>

03:06.720 --> 03:08.920
<i>I'm just glad I didn't completely</i>
<i>muck it up, to be fair.</i>

03:09.360 --> 03:12.440
<i>It would mean so much</i>
<i>to these gentlemen,</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:13.920
<i>four supporters putting</i>
<i>the same amount</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:15.400
<i>of money to save the club.</i>

03:15.480 --> 03:17.480
It's very special, this place.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.240
Ask any player
who's ever played for us,

03:20.320 --> 03:21.320
how did he feel about it?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.800
And I'm starting to
get that vibe.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.280
Unfortunately, I've never been
linked with this club before,

03:26.360 --> 03:27.680
<i>never played for 'em.</i>

03:29.040 --> 03:31.480
<i>So you gotta earn</i>
<i>your stripes, so to speak.</i>

03:42.120 --> 03:44.680
Should we give that
to Keith to give it to Wilf?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.560
Palace means a lot to him.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.240
He's been there really a long time,
ain't he? So it's a...

03:49.840 --> 03:51.160
<i>He wants to finish on a high.</i>

03:51.240 --> 03:53.680
Hello and welcome
to the Five Year Plan,

03:53.760 --> 03:55.120
playoff podcast.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.240
<i>I think it's lovely that</i>
<i>we've got nice people running the club.</i>

03:59.320 --> 04:01.200
One of the co-owners says,
"I like the podcast,

04:01.280 --> 04:02.960
why don't you come and do it,
in my house?"

04:03.040 --> 04:05.680
<i>We are celebrating</i>
<i>Palace's playoff victories,</i>

04:05.760 --> 04:07.320
<i>with a selection of</i>
<i>wines from years...</i>

04:07.400 --> 04:09.600
<i>...in which Palace have</i>
<i>got promoted via the playoffs.</i>

04:11.720 --> 04:12.760
<i>We've been in quite</i>
<i>a few playoffs,</i>

04:12.840 --> 04:14.160
This is a quite generous offer.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.920
You can see what it meant

04:16.000 --> 04:17.840
when we scored at Brighton.

04:19.400 --> 04:22.320
The second half
of the podcast was less

04:22.400 --> 04:24.320
fluent and coherent
than the first half.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.640
Steve was like, "Come on
come on, sit down, sit down"

04:26.720 --> 04:29.720
The, the feeling was, we've
done it. Bloody hell, we've done it.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.080
<i>And basically it ended up</i>

04:31.160 --> 04:32.680
<i>with us drinking claret</i>
<i>out of a teapot.</i>

04:32.760 --> 04:33.840
The atmosphere's gonna be amazing,

04:33.920 --> 04:35.280
so it doesn't really matter, you know...

04:35.360 --> 04:37.440
-Well, it does, though...
-Well, it does obviously.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.200
It matters about 100
million pounds.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.240
Maybe Holloway
should make that his team talk.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.440
Doesn't really matter, lads,
because there's some balloons here.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.720
Have you thought about that?

04:45.800 --> 04:47.400
33,000 Palace fans

04:47.480 --> 04:48.880
are going to be singing
their hearts out for 90 minutes

04:48.960 --> 04:50.160
and it's going to be amazing.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.120
I'm very old fashioned
and romantic about it.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.480
A football club's place at the heart
of the community,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.200
and about the history
of the club,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.160
and, I think it's right
to be romantic.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.600
Without that romantic,

04:59.680 --> 05:01.160
that's where we come from,
that's who we are.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.840
Four of us would have absolutely
no interest

05:02.920 --> 05:04.880
in buying any other
football club.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.520
It's just, it's where
we're from,

05:06.600 --> 05:08.000
and this is our big day.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.760
This would change our club.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.400
If we get promoted,
it will change our club

05:11.480 --> 05:12.640
completely and utterly.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.400
<i>This is where all the</i>
<i>match day staff,</i>

05:26.480 --> 05:29.000
the full-time, staff
will come and settle in.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.400
Come through.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.480
I was actually counting up a minute ago,
it was 28 years since--

05:34.560 --> 05:36.120
-It's a long time.
-Yeah.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.520
Yeah, loving every
minute of it though.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.600
The people that work here, work here
often through, through love,

05:44.680 --> 05:46.680
<i>some of them are Palace fans</i>
<i>and some of them,</i>

05:46.760 --> 05:49.520
<i>the biggest privilege for them</i>
<i>is actually to get a job,</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:50.840
<i>to actually work at the club</i>

05:50.920 --> 05:53.080
<i>that they support</i>
<i>and they have supported.</i>

05:55.440 --> 05:58.680
<i>What's the day going to be like</i>
<i>at Wembley, for you personally?</i>

05:58.760 --> 06:01.040
Nervous, very nervous, yeah.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.320
<i>We're expecting about</i>
<i>40,000 Palace fans.</i>

06:03.400 --> 06:04.840
<i>It's going to be a</i>
<i>really good day,</i>

06:04.920 --> 06:06.680
<i>a memorable day,</i>
<i>as most Wembley days are.</i>

06:06.760 --> 06:08.240
<i>That's what playoffs</i>
<i>are all about,</i>

06:08.320 --> 06:11.000
this is if you're gonna go up,
this is certainly the season

06:11.080 --> 06:12.960
when you want to go up with
a new Premier League television deal.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.320
<i>So financially, it's going</i>
<i>to be hugely rewarding for the club.</i>

06:16.400 --> 06:17.840
<i>There's going to be</i>
<i>a massive sea change</i>

06:17.920 --> 06:20.120
<i>in terms of what happens here,</i>
<i>at Selhurst</i>

06:20.200 --> 06:22.240
<i>and really looking</i>
<i>forward to it.</i>

06:27.000 --> 06:28.720
<i>Now, this little number here,</i>

06:28.800 --> 06:31.680
<i>It's just to remind people to keep</i>
<i>football in perspective, right?</i>

06:31.760 --> 06:33.040
<i>You lot are going</i>
<i>to help me out on the chorus,</i>

06:33.120 --> 06:35.280
<i>"Stop Moaning,</i>
<i>and try being Palace."</i>

06:35.360 --> 06:37.520
<i>I got a call from the club.</i>

06:37.600 --> 06:39.880
<i>The board was happy to sort</i>
<i>out some tickets for me,</i>

06:39.960 --> 06:42.920
'cause I'd performed
on soccer AM the day before,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.360
on Saturday.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.480
<i>If you a Man City fan</i>
<i>Struggling with depression</i>

06:46.560 --> 06:49.360
<i>When you've only been multimillionaires</i>
<i>For five seconds</i>

06:49.440 --> 06:52.640
<i>Why not try administration</i>
<i>For size trying to scrape a couple mil</i>

06:52.720 --> 06:54.240
<i>Just to keep your club alive</i>

06:54.320 --> 06:57.240
I was stuck in a studio
in MediaCity in Salford,

06:57.320 --> 06:58.760
<i>couldn't take them</i>
<i>up on the offer,</i>

06:59.200 --> 07:02.640
<i>which is about what it's like</i>
<i>to support a club that struggles.</i>

07:02.720 --> 07:04.320
<i>If I do a song "Moaning"</i>

07:04.400 --> 07:07.120
about being a Palace fan,
perhaps we'll win.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.960
Yeah, all the conditions
to be a fantastic...

07:13.040 --> 07:16.040
...fantastic game.
I'll be looking forward to,

07:16.120 --> 07:19.720
to winning the game
and playing the game.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.960
They've done palace before,
so I'll reckon they'll do them again.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.600
I reckon we're going to win 2-0.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.560
<i>Really, really massive games</i>

07:29.640 --> 07:31.800
probably the biggest playoff final
we've been in.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.360
The pain that we've been through

07:34.440 --> 07:36.280
with the administrations
and things like that.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.160
<i>I think we've got</i>
<i>the courage to do it, I think we do.</i>

07:40.240 --> 07:41.680
In a one-off game,
anything could happen.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.320
<i>Since we were</i>
<i>down on our knees,</i>

07:46.400 --> 07:49.320
we've come up quite quickly,
so I hope we can sort of,

07:49.400 --> 07:52.440
it's not too much too
soon for us...

07:52.520 --> 07:55.080
I just think for the local area,
you know,

07:55.160 --> 07:59.520
Crystal Palace Football Club
helps bring everyone together.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.200
<i>If there was</i>
<i>an up and down club,</i>

08:01.600 --> 08:04.040
<i>it'd be nice to go up and try</i>
<i>and have a good run up there.</i>

08:08.160 --> 08:09.640
<i>What'd you think</i>
<i>of the Watford side?</i>

08:09.720 --> 08:12.280
-Oh, they’re crap.
-George!

08:12.360 --> 08:14.680
Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

08:14.760 --> 08:16.280
Come on, the Palace!

08:19.040 --> 08:22.120
<i>The money is, you know,</i>
<i>120 million pounds,</i>

08:22.200 --> 08:24.040
Palace never had that
money before.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.520
Wembley is a special place.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.080
It doesn't matter
how many times you play there,

08:34.160 --> 08:35.280
every time you step,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.200
into that pitch,
it's overwhelming.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.920
The most nervous
I've ever been in my life,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.280
He took us to Wembley,
the day before.

08:42.360 --> 08:45.160
<i>And it just so happened to be the day</i>
<i>after the Champions League final.</i>

08:45.240 --> 08:46.720
<i>It was a great idea from him.</i>

08:46.800 --> 08:47.960
He got us into the stadium

08:48.040 --> 08:49.680
and they were actually
undressing Wembley,

08:49.760 --> 08:50.960
<i>from the Champions League final</i>

08:51.040 --> 08:52.720
<i>and dressing it up</i>
<i>for the play-off final.</i>

08:52.840 --> 08:55.600
<i>Familiarized with the ground,</i>

08:55.680 --> 08:57.000
<i>the changing rooms.</i>

08:57.080 --> 08:59.240
<i>We saw where</i>
<i>our families would be sat.</i>

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
Walk on the pitch.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.120
And for a lot lads who hadn't been

09:02.200 --> 09:04.880
<i>in an arena</i>
<i>like that, I certainly hadn't.</i>

09:04.960 --> 09:06.400
I'd only been
to Wembley once before

09:06.480 --> 09:08.000
and that was for a U2 concert.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.440
Enabled us to kind of,

09:09.520 --> 09:11.640
settle any kind of nerves.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.880
And we only have one
thing in mind

09:13.960 --> 09:16.560
We had to just turn up and play,

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
prepare and play.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.280
Not a lot of teams do that,

09:19.360 --> 09:20.800
but Ollie did things like that,

09:20.880 --> 09:22.160
and he was brilliant
in the playoffs.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.080
We got back to the hotel,
and we had pre-match

09:24.160 --> 09:26.400
and we went through
our analysis, et cetera.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.240
Gabbidon came in and kept two clean sheets
against Brighton

09:29.320 --> 09:32.200
in the semis, and performed
remarkably with Damo

09:32.280 --> 09:33.600
<i>and I knew I wasn't gonna play,</i>

09:33.680 --> 09:35.640
but I knew I needed to be
supportive of the group

09:35.720 --> 09:37.600
just as we all were,
and make sure that everybody

09:37.680 --> 09:38.720
was right and ready to go.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.160
That night before the final,

09:40.240 --> 09:42.560
I don't think I slept an hour.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.760
I was up all night, I was that excited
and nervous at the same time.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.800
And thinking, "I don't know
how I'm going to play."

09:47.880 --> 09:49.640
The best game
you can play, you know,

09:49.720 --> 09:51.640
because if you win,
it's life changing.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.080
You're going back
a Premier League player,

09:54.160 --> 09:56.560
or you're staring down the barrel
of 50 games a season again.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.400
It's cataclysmic,
the difference,

09:58.480 --> 10:02.320
and to have that magnitude
of a gap,

10:02.400 --> 10:04.040
being on one game of football,

10:04.960 --> 10:06.320
is unbelievable.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.840
The first thing I did, I watched

10:07.920 --> 10:10.320
the highlights
of the Palace West Ham game.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.440
<i>Crystal Palace are in</i>
<i>the premiership!</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:14.720
<i>It's no longer a dream.</i>

10:14.800 --> 10:16.760
<i>It's reality!</i>

10:17.480 --> 10:19.400
Just couldn't believe
that that was,

10:19.480 --> 10:20.920
about to happen ahead and,

10:21.000 --> 10:22.600
I was just so excited, you know,

10:22.680 --> 10:24.680
being a Palace boy and growing up
through the Academy, I couldn't

10:26.000 --> 10:27.720
I couldn't wait to
get out there.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.480
This will be something
that I think about the rest of my life.

10:47.560 --> 10:48.840
I was in the pub at 10 o'clock,

10:48.920 --> 10:50.840
quite a few Palace fans
there already.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.240
We decided to be
mature, and not,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.280
meet in the pub until half nine
in the morning.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.960
There's something really quite,

10:58.040 --> 11:00.360
quite wonderful about
it, really.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.680
<i>Palace have a lot to prove,</i>
<i>and especially after the Brighton match.</i>

11:04.760 --> 11:07.800
I think we'll lift our game
and I think we could win this.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.760
We are the underdog team, you know.
We thrive on that.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.800
It's a big day for all, you know,
all the staff as well

11:12.880 --> 11:14.400
you know, there's a lot
of people behind the scenes.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.040
<i>Their job's going to totally change</i>
<i>if we go up.</i>

11:16.120 --> 11:18.280
<i>So it's a very exciting time</i>
<i>for everybody.</i>

11:20.240 --> 11:21.280
<i>Best game in football.</i>

11:21.360 --> 11:22.920
It's your whole season
in one game.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.800
And it translates in the crowd.
It's superb.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.240
Champions League was, it was electric.
This will be better.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.720
<i>When you look at those sides</i>
<i>that are in the top flight</i>

11:31.800 --> 11:33.240
<i>and they've been</i>
<i>there for a few years,</i>

11:33.320 --> 11:35.560
<i>they've managed to build</i>
<i>such great infrastructures,</i>

11:35.640 --> 11:38.600
it's not just investing
in the squad, everything improves.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.240
So, just an amazing scene
to be part of and,

11:41.320 --> 11:43.600
and to think that one end
of it will be red and blue,

11:43.680 --> 11:45.640
<i>and I think it's very</i>
<i>tense and exciting</i>

11:45.720 --> 11:47.520
<i>at the same time</i>
<i>for both sets of fans.</i>

11:49.920 --> 11:51.360
I was absolutely fine
up until last night,

11:51.440 --> 11:52.840
and I woke up this morning
about three o' clock,

11:53.120 --> 11:54.320
and I felt terrible.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.440
I was on the train up here
I felt physically sick.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.640
Adrenaline and nerves,
excitement, just so close.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.720
Didn't think we would be here
when I last spoke to you,

12:04.800 --> 12:08.440
but we're here, sun's out,
here we go.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.160
Every step I take close
to that stadium,

12:10.240 --> 12:13.000
all the nerves are
gonna kick in so,

12:13.080 --> 12:14.760
just got to repeat exactly
what we did at Brighton

12:14.840 --> 12:16.240
and there's no way
we could be beaten

12:16.320 --> 12:18.880
Just everywhere,
on every street corner was red and blue.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.680
Come on, Palace!

12:22.280 --> 12:24.080
It was such a vibrant, lively...

12:25.080 --> 12:26.160
Palace!

12:27.760 --> 12:29.160
<i>It's the thing about</i>
<i>Palace fans,</i>

12:29.240 --> 12:30.640
<i>they'll always give you</i>
<i>an incredible atmosphere,</i>

12:30.720 --> 12:32.160
<i>and at Wembley,</i>
<i>it's going to be amazing.</i>

12:32.240 --> 12:33.600
<i>This is just a little sample,</i>

12:33.680 --> 12:35.000
<i>it's going to be this</i>
<i>times a hundred at Wembley</i>

12:35.080 --> 12:36.760
and that's, whatever
happens in the game,

12:36.840 --> 12:37.880
that's what you
always get with Palace.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.320
We need to make the Premier League,

12:39.400 --> 12:40.520
so I can spread around a little more.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.040
Not enough Palace supporters
back home.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.640
<i>It'll be emotional, I know that,</i>

12:43.720 --> 12:45.280
<i>it was emotional down at Brighton,</i>

12:45.360 --> 12:46.880
just for the journey we've had,
in these last few years,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.840
just the journey you guys have
seen in the last six months.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.680
<i>I think words can't really describe</i>
<i>the whole atmosphere</i>

12:59.760 --> 13:01.240
<i>and what's it gonna mean</i>

13:01.320 --> 13:03.000
but it's a very, very
special day.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.080
Eagles!

13:07.760 --> 13:10.160
Palace!

13:12.280 --> 13:14.720
We're ready to go.
We're getting ready to rock and roll.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.920
<i>Thirty-eight thousands tickets</i>
<i>we sold, no problem.</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:49.120
<i>People came from</i>
<i>all over the world to watch that.</i>

13:49.960 --> 13:51.280
<i>We're a brilliantly</i>
<i>supported club</i>

13:51.360 --> 13:52.920
<i>with brilliant fans, who support the club</i>

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
<i>in the right way.</i>

13:54.080 --> 13:55.520
<i>Once you get in there,7</i>

13:55.600 --> 13:57.560
<i>you just have to sit there</i>

13:57.640 --> 14:00.160
and you have to take a moment
to sort of look around and...

14:00.840 --> 14:02.240
you just have to, 'cause...

14:03.080 --> 14:05.680
<i>What other time in your life</i>
<i>are you so excited about balloons?</i>

14:05.760 --> 14:09.120
Probably when you're three,
and then when you're in your 50s

14:09.200 --> 14:12.560
and you're at Wembley at a playoff final.
There's balloons everywhere.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.680
It's always a fantastic moment

14:14.760 --> 14:17.560
<i>when the balloons go flying</i>
<i>and the whole end</i>

14:17.640 --> 14:19.120
<i>just turned red and blue,</i>
<i>it's brilliant.</i>

14:20.040 --> 14:23.640
The constant singing, none more so,
than that day at Wembley.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.000
The fanatics had played
a very important part.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.040
<i>And Steven was always</i>
<i>in touch with them, you know,</i>

14:28.120 --> 14:30.040
<i>so things like them being</i>
<i>in the middle.</i>

14:30.400 --> 14:34.320
<i>But I'd got on really well with them.</i>
<i>I think they're a good bunch of lads.</i>

14:35.400 --> 14:37.880
Palace beat everyone
in the stands at Wembley.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.440
That's a fact.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.200
I couldn't wait to get to Wembley,
just to hear the noise.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.640
It was tense at times
but when that lot got singing...

14:44.720 --> 14:45.920
...it was just incredible.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.120
Absolutely deafening.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.160
Seeing so much of our
fans that day...

14:50.240 --> 14:51.720
...we had so many.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.120
<i>They make a noise,</i>
<i>no matter what's happening in the game.</i>

14:55.680 --> 14:57.560
And I just always felt like
they'd be with us.

14:57.640 --> 15:00.480
Mate, they turn up
and they sing their hearts out.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.400
<i>And it comes onto the pitch.</i>

15:02.760 --> 15:04.520
Everyone knows the Palace fans,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.920
it's just like we're having
that 12th man.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.560
It just makes such a difference.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.000
We went together the whole way,
you know, into that game.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.200
So it wasn't a surprise
for me to see it.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.920
<i>But I'm pretty sure it was a big shock</i>
<i>when the Watford players saw that.</i>

15:18.000 --> 15:19.400
They're a passionate bunch

15:19.480 --> 15:21.400
<i>that kind of epitomize</i>
<i>what the club is all about.</i>

15:21.480 --> 15:23.640
<i>For all the supporters</i>
<i>and for all of the bad times</i>

15:23.720 --> 15:27.040
and for their massive role
couple of years before

15:27.120 --> 15:30.360
<i>standing outside Lloyds Bank</i>
<i>and showing their love for the club</i>

15:30.440 --> 15:32.520
<i>and their desire to keep</i>
<i>the club going.</i>

15:32.600 --> 15:35.640
The way they were cheering us on that day,
we had to win.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.640
<i>A terrific atmosphere</i>
<i>at a sun filled Wembley stadium.</i>

15:39.720 --> 15:41.160
<i>Who will seize their moments</i>

15:41.240 --> 15:42.400
<i>as they go head-to-head</i>

15:42.480 --> 15:44.200
<i>in the championship play-off final</i>

15:44.280 --> 15:46.520
<i>with a place</i>
<i>in the Premier League at stake?</i>

15:46.600 --> 15:49.200
<i>After 48 games,</i>
<i>it all comes down</i>

15:49.280 --> 15:51.960
<i>to this one season</i>
<i>defining game.</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:10.520
<i>What an occasion, what a day.</i>

16:10.600 --> 16:12.080
<i>Will one of these players</i>

16:12.160 --> 16:15.200
<i>write their names</i>
<i>in their club's history?</i>

16:24.200 --> 16:26.760
<i>Victory means promotion</i>
<i>to the Premier League,</i>

16:26.840 --> 16:30.760
<i>a chance to mix it with the best</i>
<i>in the business.</i>

16:38.800 --> 16:42.560
<i>The two top scoring sides</i>
<i>in the championship.</i>

16:42.640 --> 16:46.960
<i>You wouldn't believe it,</i>
<i>last season, Palace 17th, Watford, 11th.</i>

16:47.560 --> 16:48.760
<i>You could've won yourself</i>
<i>a lot of money</i>

16:48.840 --> 16:51.160
<i>if you'd have put anything</i>
<i>on this</i>

16:51.240 --> 16:52.640
<i>being this year's play-off final.</i>

16:53.000 --> 16:55.600
<i>The most mighty of prizes.</i>

16:55.680 --> 16:58.160
<i>It's a very tough one</i>
<i>to call this one.</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:07.800
<i>Let's not forget they had</i>
<i>an absolutely wretched end</i>

17:07.880 --> 17:09.760
<i>to the domestic season.</i>

17:09.840 --> 17:13.320
<i>No side in six years had been in</i>
<i>as bad form as them</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:14.600
<i>getting into the playoffs.</i>

17:15.560 --> 17:18.360
<i>It's character. They got off to</i>
<i>the worst ever start, didn't they?</i>

17:18.440 --> 17:20.120
<i>Forty-nine years.</i>

17:20.200 --> 17:22.640
<i>Lost the first three games,</i>
<i>then they got it going.</i>

17:22.720 --> 17:25.120
<i>Then they lost their manager,</i>
<i>at Brighton, came through.</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:29.280
<i>They gave a performance</i>
<i>worthy of them being here this afternoon.</i>

17:29.800 --> 17:31.880
<i>With the first little flash</i>
<i>from the man</i>

17:31.960 --> 17:34.640
<i>whose goals carried Crystal Palace</i>
<i>to Wembley.</i>

17:34.720 --> 17:36.240
<i>They need to get the ball</i>
<i>out to him.</i>

17:36.320 --> 17:38.840
<i>And this is the kind of</i>
<i>unsung work that he does.</i>

17:38.920 --> 17:40.640
<i>Supporters and people</i>
<i>have noticed</i>

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
<i>just what a huge job he's done</i>
<i>for this team.</i>

17:42.800 --> 17:45.480
<i>And him and Dikgacoi, they're gonna need</i>
<i>massive games here.</i>

17:48.440 --> 17:49.880
<i>-This is a concern.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

17:49.960 --> 17:51.720
<i>A big concern for</i>
<i>Crystal Palace.</i>

17:51.800 --> 17:54.560
<i>'Cause Kagisho Dikgacoi</i>
<i>is a big player for them.</i>

17:54.640 --> 17:56.520
<i>KG goes down early in the game</i>

17:56.600 --> 17:59.120
<i>and I'm not gonna lie,</i>
<i>you know, we were a bit worried.</i>

17:59.200 --> 18:02.040
<i>It's absolutely devastating</i>
<i>and understandably so.</i>

18:02.120 --> 18:04.880
Him and Mile just compliment
each other perfectly.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.000
<i>Massively hard working as well,</i>
<i>and such a big part of what we did.</i>

18:08.080 --> 18:09.440
<i>Fifteen minutes into the game</i>

18:09.520 --> 18:12.240
<i>and one of their key players</i>
<i>has been lost to them.</i>

18:12.320 --> 18:13.760
<i>Highly unfortunate.</i>

18:13.840 --> 18:17.200
<i>They will send on</i>
<i>Stuart O'Keefe.</i>

18:17.320 --> 18:20.600
<i>That was a big, big, big stage</i>
<i>for Stuart to walk out on.</i>

18:20.680 --> 18:23.000
<i>He rattled somebody</i>
<i>in his first challenge</i>

18:23.080 --> 18:25.920
and he was absolutely
outstanding.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.000
<i>It's come to Matej Vydra.</i>

18:31.640 --> 18:35.440
<i>What do they say, a goal-saving challenge</i>
<i>from Damien Delaney.</i>

18:35.520 --> 18:37.200
<i>And that's wonderful defending.</i>

18:37.280 --> 18:38.880
<i>It's been tight</i>
<i>and it's been tense.</i>

18:39.320 --> 18:40.960
<i>Tactically brilliant</i>
<i>so far from Palace.</i>

18:41.040 --> 18:43.120
<i>They're only missing a little bit</i>
<i>of a cutting edge</i>

18:43.200 --> 18:44.360
<i>in the final third</i>
<i>from their perspective.</i>

18:45.960 --> 18:47.680
<i>Crystal palace have done</i>
<i>pretty much exactly</i>

18:47.760 --> 18:49.680
<i>what their manager</i>
<i>has asked them to do.</i>

18:50.760 --> 18:53.920
<i>Well, if the first half was posturing,</i>
<i>sizing each other up,</i>

18:54.440 --> 18:56.480
<i>just jabbing, looking</i>
<i>for weaknesses,</i>

18:56.560 --> 18:58.120
<i>now we are down</i>
<i>to the real business.</i>

18:58.200 --> 19:00.880
<i>Forty-five minutes,</i>
<i>one of these two clubs</i>

19:00.960 --> 19:02.240
<i>away from the Premier League.</i>

19:02.880 --> 19:05.400
<i>Kevin Phillips.</i>
<i>An ominous presence on the bench there,</i>

19:05.480 --> 19:06.920
<i>Yannick Bolasie, you can see.</i>

19:07.000 --> 19:08.280
<i>Peter Ramage as well.</i>

19:08.360 --> 19:11.400
<i>Well, there may yet be</i>
<i>another twist literally.</i>

19:11.480 --> 19:15.920
<i>Jedinak seems to have injured himself</i>
<i>as he tried to steady himself.</i>

19:16.000 --> 19:18.720
<i>You can see, he's in pain.</i>

19:19.240 --> 19:20.720
I was on one leg.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.360
I think he rolled his ankle.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.120
And to be honest with you,
although you saw him limping about,

19:25.200 --> 19:27.720
he never made a big deal out of it.
It sums him up.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.240
Once in a lifetime opportunity for him
to go into the Premier League

19:31.320 --> 19:32.760
and it wasn't going
to distract him.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.920
<i>Crystal Palace skipper, he's playing</i>
<i>this second half</i>

19:35.000 --> 19:37.920
<i>almost on one leg.</i>
<i>He's having an outstanding game.</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:41.200
<i>Tells you everything about his character</i>
<i>the fact he's still out there.</i>

19:41.280 --> 19:43.240
Mile was the one
that was driving everybody.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.840
He just led in every aspect.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.000
<i>Touch back for Abdi.</i>

19:47.080 --> 19:49.240
<i>Well, not for the first time.</i>
<i>That's Damien Delaney.</i>

19:49.760 --> 19:52.400
<i>Goes up towards Delaney</i>
<i>into a good area... Wilbraham.</i>

19:52.480 --> 19:54.400
<i>Pudil into the box.</i>

19:54.480 --> 19:58.280
<i>It's a fair challenge,</i>
<i>it's a risky one, it had to be perfect.</i>

19:59.040 --> 20:02.320
<i>A cut-back from Wilbraham</i>
<i>and Watford have men back.</i>

20:02.400 --> 20:04.520
<i>We have come to life,</i>
<i>haven't we?</i>

20:04.600 --> 20:07.920
<i>It's starting to feel more like a final</i>
<i>worthy of the stakes.</i>

20:09.240 --> 20:10.320
<i>Still Zaha.</i>

20:10.400 --> 20:12.320
<i>Had the chance to</i>
<i>play it earlier.</i>

20:12.400 --> 20:16.360
<i>Here's O'Keefe.</i>
<i>What a save from Manuel Almunia.</i>

20:17.040 --> 20:19.440
<i>I was the decoy.</i>
<i>Having players like Kev to bring on</i>

20:19.520 --> 20:21.680
shows our strength and depth
we had that year.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.640
If I'm being honest,
it probably felt this will be it.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.840
This will be my last game,
what a way to go out,

20:25.920 --> 20:27.800
<i>you know, against the club</i>
<i>where it all started.</i>

20:31.040 --> 20:33.120
<i>They have left it. Wilbraham.</i>

20:33.200 --> 20:34.960
<i>I think Alby could've have had</i>
<i>an hat trick on the day.</i>

20:35.440 --> 20:36.880
He deserved a goal that final.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.520
It would have capped a great contribution
to a season.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.280
<i>Almunia's come, hasn't</i>
<i>got there.</i>

20:41.880 --> 20:44.640
<i>Danny Gabbidon knows.</i>
<i>That was a glorious chance.</i>

20:44.720 --> 20:47.400
<i>That pot of gold</i>
<i>awaits one of these two.</i>

20:47.960 --> 20:50.760
<i>Extra time if required,</i>
<i>penalty kicks as well.</i>

20:52.320 --> 20:53.480
<i>Garvan!</i>

20:58.200 --> 21:00.360
<i>Zaha, he's got it through</i>
<i>to Wilbraham.</i>

21:00.440 --> 21:02.320
<i>Again, Almunia is his equal.</i>

21:04.480 --> 21:06.520
<i>Zaha couldn't find a finish.</i>

21:06.600 --> 21:08.040
<i>Moritz's corner.</i>

21:08.560 --> 21:09.720
<i>Jedinak.</i>

21:14.520 --> 21:15.640
<i>End of the game.</i>

21:16.880 --> 21:19.080
<i>We go again for another</i>
<i>half an hour.</i>

21:19.160 --> 21:21.160
<i>The longer the game</i>
<i>went on and we never scored,</i>

21:21.240 --> 21:23.000
you just think is it not
gonna be our day.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.600
Four against one.
We’ve gotta be due one now, right?

21:25.680 --> 21:27.840
<i>Keep fucking believing</i>
<i>it's gonna come...</i>

21:28.920 --> 21:31.640
<i>All right? I'm fucking proud of you.</i>
<i>Don't forget...</i>

21:32.440 --> 21:35.040
<i>The chances that Palace created,</i>
<i>they need to take them chances.</i>

21:35.120 --> 21:37.680
<i>And it worries me whether there's</i>
<i>going to be a backlash from Watford.</i>

21:37.760 --> 21:39.840
<i>It's gonna be decided</i>
<i>either in the next 30 minutes</i>

21:39.920 --> 21:41.360
<i>or by a penalty shootout.</i>

21:51.240 --> 21:54.760
<i>It's tantalizingly close for both,</i>
<i>but yet it's so far away.</i>

21:57.680 --> 22:00.240
It was weird 'cause it
happened so quick.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.760
It came across
and I've turned to try and flick it on.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.440
<i>Well, this could come to Deeney.</i>

22:09.520 --> 22:11.440
Deeney has come in
off my shoulder

22:11.520 --> 22:14.040
Troy gets in front of Wardy,
it would have been a tap-in.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.760
And I knew I had
to do something.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.880
<i>What a save that was!</i>

22:19.960 --> 22:23.680
<i>How on Earth did Julian Speroni</i>
<i>keep Troy Deeney at bay?</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:26.640
It was a relief,
a massive relief.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.120
And that's why, obviously,
he was the legend that he was.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.760
I think it's underrated how much Julian
was moving one way

22:31.840 --> 22:33.880
<i>and to have the reflexes</i>
<i>and the strength in his legs.</i>

22:33.960 --> 22:36.280
It was incredible.
I just thought he was gonna score.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.040
<i>And Jules managed to somehow</i>
<i>claw it away.</i>

22:39.120 --> 22:40.720
<i>And still to this day,</i>
<i>one of the best keepers</i>

22:40.800 --> 22:41.880
<i>that I've ever come across.</i>

22:41.960 --> 22:44.360
<i>Nearly a decade at the club, yet again,</i>

22:44.440 --> 22:45.680
<i>he's the main man for Palace.</i>

22:45.760 --> 22:49.680
They targeted Wilf
on their aging full-back.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.120
Just keep taking him on.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.120
He'll get booked or
he'll get sent off.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.000
Get at the full-backs
as much as I can really.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.440
<i>Zaha.</i>

22:57.520 --> 23:00.440
<i>Beautiful trickery</i>
<i>to take it away from Cassetti.</i>

23:00.520 --> 23:04.240
<i>Cassetti again getting</i>
<i>too close to Zaha.</i>

23:04.320 --> 23:07.600
They moved him four times
to try and get him away from Wilf.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.880
<i>I don't know how on earth</i>
<i>Cassetti hasn't been booked.</i>

23:09.960 --> 23:13.880
<i>Once again, Cassetti,</i>
<i>wants to mix it physically with Zaha.</i>

23:13.960 --> 23:15.480
<i>It's been the wrong thing to do.</i>

23:15.560 --> 23:16.840
<i>There's no doubt that he's been on top</i>

23:16.920 --> 23:18.640
<i>in that particular duel</i>

23:18.720 --> 23:20.840
Put him left-back, put him right-back,
put him at sweeper,

23:20.920 --> 23:23.200
and I just said, "Stay there."
And my lads knew.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.480
And we kept feeding Wilf
and what happened?

23:32.520 --> 23:33.640
<i>Phillips to Zaha.</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:41.840
<i>Still Zaha. There's a risky challenge.</i>
<i>And there's a penalty.</i>

23:42.720 --> 23:46.040
<i>Wilfried Zaha took on Cassetti,</i>
<i>who took the bait.</i>

23:46.280 --> 23:49.080
<i>Once again, totally outwitted,</i>

23:49.160 --> 23:52.000
<i>out foxed, clear penalty.</i>

23:52.080 --> 23:53.000
<i>He knows.</i>

23:54.080 --> 23:55.520
<i>He knows who's going to take it.</i>

23:55.600 --> 23:57.600
Would you have wanted anyone else
to take that penalty?

23:57.680 --> 24:00.360
You couldn't have a better player
to take that responsibility.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.520
If you want someone to take a penalty
against his old club

24:05.200 --> 24:09.320
and not worry too much,
Kevin Phillips was perfect.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.560
If there's one person you want
on that field to take a penalty,

24:11.640 --> 24:12.560
it was Kevin Phillips.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.080
You know, this is his occasion.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.160
Funny enough, I felt
as calm as anything.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.400
I don't know why
I don't know whether it's...

24:17.480 --> 24:19.160
Possibly could be my last game
of my career,

24:19.240 --> 24:20.600
why get nervous?

24:20.680 --> 24:22.680
I just felt like as soon as
that ref blew the whistle,

24:22.760 --> 24:24.320
I wanted to take it.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.840
Actually Moritz tried to take the ball
off me for the penalty.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.080
Absolutely not, like,
you know...

24:29.160 --> 24:31.600
No way... Moritz,
what a good guy

24:31.680 --> 24:34.760
but very emotional.
Fabulous striker of the ball.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.200
Andre would have probably
scored it but...

24:36.280 --> 24:38.040
When you've got someone like Kevin
in the building,

24:38.120 --> 24:39.080
like, he's getting it.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.400
When it was penalty...

24:40.480 --> 24:43.200
...big Kev is stepping
up, no chance.

24:43.280 --> 24:46.480
And we knew Almunia,
he had a favourite side.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.280
And I thought
he's not going to try that

24:49.360 --> 24:51.080
because he knows
Almunia is gonna go that way.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.080
He was so confident.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.440
Ollie was making us practice penalties
in the week leading up to it.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.640
And I just remember Kev Phillips
standing on the side of the 18-yard box

24:58.720 --> 24:59.880
laughing at us.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.280
I remember him saying to me, he goes,

25:01.360 --> 25:02.560
"You practice as many times as you want,"

25:02.640 --> 25:04.360
he said,
"Here, it'll make no difference here."

25:04.440 --> 25:05.760
"You can never replicate that,"
he said.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.440
"And that's why
I don't want to practice penalties."

25:07.560 --> 25:08.720
And he didn't practice
one penalty.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.040
Ice-cold veins it was.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.320
He was just the man for the occasion.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.000
Massive game, massive penalty
in extra time.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.320
This is... This is
Kevin Phillips.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.760
As soon as I put the
ball on the spot,

25:19.840 --> 25:22.040
<i>I wasn't focusing on the noise.</i>

25:22.120 --> 25:23.680
<i>Once I looked up at</i>
<i>the goalkeeper,</i>

25:23.760 --> 25:26.480
<i>I could see loads of gestures</i>
<i>from the Watford supporters.</i>

25:26.560 --> 25:29.440
<i>It was kind of like a deathly silence.</i>
<i>I went into a zone.</i>

25:33.600 --> 25:36.320
<i>I just had it in me head</i>
<i>where I wanted to kick the ball.</i>

25:36.400 --> 25:39.440
And as soon as it left my foot,
I didn't expect it to go where it went.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.800
<i>Kevin Phillips of all people.</i>

25:59.760 --> 26:03.080
<i>The club where it all started</i>
<i>for him professionally, Kevin Phillips</i>

26:03.480 --> 26:04.680
<i>is put to the sword!</i>

26:05.080 --> 26:08.880
<i>by the master craftsman!</i>
<i>Kevin Phillips at Wembley,</i>

26:09.160 --> 26:12.360
<i>in the dying minutes</i>
<i>of the first period of extra time.</i>

26:12.440 --> 26:15.840
<i>That just might be</i>
<i>the one to send Palace</i>

26:15.920 --> 26:17.720
<i>back to the Premier League!</i>

26:17.800 --> 26:19.640
<i>If you want anyone, anyone,</i>

26:19.720 --> 26:22.200
<i>in the world to have</i>
<i>this moment...</i>

26:23.240 --> 26:26.720
<i>...not to panic, to stay calm,</i>
<i>to hit the back of the net</i>

26:26.800 --> 26:29.440
<i>in a place</i>
<i>where no goalkeeper in the world</i>

26:29.840 --> 26:33.800
<i>is gonna save it,</i>
<i>then step forward, Kevin Phillips.</i>

26:33.880 --> 26:35.520
<i>Never ever in any doubt.</i>

26:35.960 --> 26:37.440
<i>That was an emphatic penalty!</i>

26:37.520 --> 26:39.720
<i>And look what it means.</i>

26:39.800 --> 26:44.600
<i>Now, they can reach out and touch</i>
<i>the Barclay's Premier League.</i>

26:45.280 --> 26:48.200
<i>Fifteen minutes</i>
<i>and they are there.</i>

26:48.280 --> 26:50.200
<i>He gets so close</i>
<i>to saving it, the keeper.</i>

26:50.440 --> 26:51.840
<i>Seeing it from our end I thought,</i>
<i>"Man, he's buried that."</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:53.240
<i>The keeper got nowhere near it.</i>

26:53.320 --> 26:55.240
He got quite a bit near
it, didn't he?

26:55.320 --> 26:57.720
I never actually saw the penalty go in,
I was facing the other way.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.440
I remember just looking down, kind of,
couldn't really see the big screen,

27:01.520 --> 27:03.040
and then I saw the
Palace fans cheer.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.360
The relief when Kev scored.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.360
Even though Almunia
went the right way,

27:06.440 --> 27:08.280
that was how confident
he was and how good he was

27:08.360 --> 27:10.400
in those circumstances,
under pressure.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.120
Probably turned out to be
one of the best penalties in my career

27:13.200 --> 27:15.520
and I didn't actually feel nervous,
which was weird.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.320
<i>Is this to be the day</i>
<i>that the Kevin Phillips story,</i>

27:18.400 --> 27:21.600
<i>the extraordinary story that it is</i>
<i>starting off in non-league football,</i>

27:21.680 --> 27:23.600
<i>gets the happiest of endings.</i>

27:23.680 --> 27:25.680
<i>Maybe at the age of 40,</i>

27:26.240 --> 27:30.800
<i>he will be playing in the Premier League</i>
<i>one more time.</i>

27:30.880 --> 27:33.000
<i>It's there, touching distance</i>

27:33.720 --> 27:36.440
<i>Fifteen minutes away</i>
<i>from the Premier League.</i>

27:37.280 --> 27:39.800
<i>From the moment we</i>
<i>scored the goal,</i>

27:40.520 --> 27:44.400
I remember turning to Brighty at one point
and saying to him, I can't breathe.

27:44.640 --> 27:48.000
I actually can't breathe.
The pressure was so great.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.880
<i>Well it looked like Crystal Palace</i>
<i>seemed to lose their momentum.</i>

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
<i>Just one win in their</i>
<i>last ten games</i>

27:54.640 --> 27:57.520
<i>but they have gathered themselves</i>
<i>in some style.</i>

27:57.600 --> 28:00.760
<i>What moments for this</i>
<i>man, Steve Parish,</i>

28:00.840 --> 28:03.800
<i>who led the consortium</i>
<i>of Crystal Palace supporters</i>

28:03.880 --> 28:06.400
<i>who rescued the club</i>
<i>from the brink.</i>

28:06.760 --> 28:09.040
<i>Successful businessmen,</i>
<i>they admit themselves</i>

28:09.120 --> 28:11.040
<i>that it didn't make</i>
<i>any business sense to get involved</i>

28:11.120 --> 28:13.080
<i>with the club</i>
<i>that they'd loved since children.</i>

28:13.160 --> 28:15.760
<i>But it's all making big sense now,</i>
<i>you can bet that.</i>

28:15.840 --> 28:20.640
<i>There's an awful lot of football</i>
<i>still to be played.</i>

28:20.720 --> 28:23.280
<i>They've got 15 minutes, Watford,</i>
<i>to do something about it.</i>

28:27.560 --> 28:28.560
Strap in.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.400
The fear then starts to spread round

28:30.480 --> 28:32.440
and it did seem like a long 15 minutes.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.840
<i>That it was going</i>
<i>on and on and on forever.</i>

28:34.920 --> 28:36.360
<i>So painful.</i>

28:39.000 --> 28:40.800
<i>And what about this for a pass.</i>

28:40.880 --> 28:43.200
<i>Clever movement from Phillips</i>
<i>but the diagonal ball.</i>

28:43.800 --> 28:44.880
<i>Wonderful.</i>

28:45.440 --> 28:47.640
<i>Talk about big players</i>
<i>in big games,</i>

28:47.720 --> 28:51.680
<i>and he has been really,</i>
<i>really up for this challenge</i>

28:51.760 --> 28:54.920
<i>of getting his boyhood team</i>
<i>into the Premier League.</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:56.440
<i>And signing off in style.</i>

28:57.200 --> 28:59.320
<i>Speroni out in double</i>
<i>quick time.</i>

29:00.120 --> 29:02.320
<i>Once again, excellent</i>
<i>goalkeeping.</i>

29:02.720 --> 29:05.520
Everyone just hit another level,
everyone rose to the occasion.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.840
<i>As we are talking about Wilfried Zaha</i>
<i>but also two central defenders,</i>

29:09.920 --> 29:11.360
<i>and Jedinak in front of them,</i>

29:11.440 --> 29:14.400
<i>absolutely monster</i>
<i>games they've had.</i>

29:14.480 --> 29:18.200
A lot of pressure and a lot
of emotional strain gets put on you.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.840
And that game going to extra time,
and it was hot that day as well,

29:20.920 --> 29:22.680
I remember it was
like 30 degrees.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.520
<i>Damien Delaney at the start</i>
<i>of the season</i>

29:24.600 --> 29:27.560
<i>thought that his football career</i>
<i>was done and dusted.</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:29.960
<i>He's moments away</i>
<i>from being back</i>

29:30.040 --> 29:31.960
<i>in the Premier League</i>
<i>with Crystal Palace.</i>

29:32.400 --> 29:34.160
<i>It's an aerial bombardment now.</i>

29:34.240 --> 29:38.560
<i>Ward dives out, closes that down,</i>
<i>hits him right in the stomach.</i>

29:38.640 --> 29:40.920
<i>And another piece of danger</i>
<i>has been seen off for them.</i>

29:41.240 --> 29:42.720
We were defending for our lives.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.240
<i>It's getting increasingly</i>
<i>frantic</i>

29:46.320 --> 29:48.760
<i>as Geijo tries to bulldoze</i>
<i>a route through.</i>

29:48.840 --> 29:51.960
<i>Forestieri! Still Forestieri!</i>

29:52.040 --> 29:54.720
I remember spinning my head round.
It was happening in slow motion.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.280
I thought, "Oh, my God
that's gonna go in."

29:56.360 --> 29:57.920
Saw Jules was over.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Yeah, I was beaten by that one.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.720
It felt like it took a minute
for it to happen.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.680
And there was that moment.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.080
Looked like it was going
in the corner.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.160
No, no.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.440
<i>Then Wardy's fat head</i>
<i>came out of nowhere, just...</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:21.320
Pleased I was in the right place
at the right time.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.800
I don't know what he was doing there.
He was in the wrong position, probably.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.880
Cleared it off the line,
I was absolutely delighted.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.080
It's so important,
that piece of defending.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.600
<i>Off the line by Ward!</i>
<i>Would you believe it?</i>

30:33.240 --> 30:34.520
<i>It's a fantastic effort</i>

30:34.600 --> 30:37.120
<i>and that really</i>
<i>epitomizes Crystal Palace.</i>

30:37.840 --> 30:41.760
<i>They've been exceptional to a man,</i>
<i>they really, really have.</i>

30:41.840 --> 30:43.640
Right, get out, get up.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.120
<i>This is our moment,</i>
<i>we're gonna seize it.</i>

30:46.160 --> 30:47.440
<i>Deeney.</i>

30:47.520 --> 30:48.920
<i>Just wide, Deeney thought</i>
<i>he'd done enough.</i>

30:49.000 --> 30:52.320
<i>This really is last chance saloon</i>
<i>for Watford now.</i>

30:52.400 --> 30:53.840
<i>It's a Gabbidon clearance.</i>

30:53.920 --> 30:56.160
<i>Almunia's up from</i>
<i>the goal as well.</i>

30:56.240 --> 30:59.320
<i>The 122nd minute of the match.</i>

31:00.760 --> 31:03.440
<i>It's the Premier League</i>
<i>for Crystal Palace again!</i>

31:05.320 --> 31:09.040
<i>The exuberance of youth!</i>
<i>The coolness of experience!</i>

31:09.120 --> 31:14.200
<i>Zaha and Phillips combine,</i>
<i>and after eight long years away</i>

31:14.280 --> 31:16.360
<i>Crystal Palace are back!</i>

31:16.440 --> 31:19.320
<i>Ian Holloway, sheer</i>
<i>delight from him.</i>

31:19.400 --> 31:22.920
<i>These are special,</i>
<i>special moments for a club</i>

31:23.040 --> 31:26.680
<i>that three years ago</i>
<i>was threatened with extinction.</i>

31:31.720 --> 31:34.040
<i>Just so happy</i>
<i>that the club is going up.</i>

31:34.120 --> 31:35.320
It felt like we belonged there.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.520
We worked hard enough
and I was just so happy,

31:37.600 --> 31:39.840
that I was glad to be
part of history, really.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.560
<i>Being in that team</i>
<i>that brought Palace up,</i>

31:42.640 --> 31:44.800
and it was just about the team.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.240
The happiness, the lift weighted
off your shoulders.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.960
<i>We're finally where we should</i>
<i>have been long time ago.</i>

31:51.040 --> 31:53.000
<i>We are now</i>
<i>a Premier League team.</i>

31:53.080 --> 31:54.280
Yeah, it's an incredible memory.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.760
<i>Boy, how lucky were we</i>
<i>to be able to witness that?</i>

32:01.840 --> 32:03.160
<i>I just slumped to my knees</i>

32:03.240 --> 32:05.040
<i>'cause I knew</i>
<i>what it was going to mean for me.</i>

32:05.120 --> 32:06.680
But having done it,
there with that group

32:06.760 --> 32:08.160
and with Crystal Palace,

32:08.680 --> 32:10.440
something that I'm always
gonna be proud of.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.240
<i>Did I ever think I would</i>
<i>play with Kevin Phillips?</i>

32:13.680 --> 32:15.440
<i>Kevin Phillips,</i>
<i>who I used to watch on TV?</i>

32:15.520 --> 32:16.720
Not a chance.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.560
It's just an amazing feeling.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.720
<i>I collapsed to the ground</i>
<i>because I just thought of...</i>

32:21.800 --> 32:23.400
<i>my parents who weren't there,</i>

32:23.480 --> 32:25.600
<i>who I lost, you know,</i>
<i>early on in my career.</i>

32:26.000 --> 32:27.920
<i>I'd lost three playoff</i>
<i>finals before.</i>

32:28.000 --> 32:30.480
Everyone kept telling me
it was the best way to get promoted.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.120
And I didn't believe them.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.520
So when that final whistle went,
I could see what they mean.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.080
That release of emotion,
everything we've been through

32:39.160 --> 32:41.400
<i>and it possibly could be your</i>
<i>last game of your career.</i>

32:41.480 --> 32:42.880
<i>You're just all floods</i>
<i>of emotion,</i>

32:42.960 --> 32:45.040
<i>and then to have all the lads</i>
<i>jump on you as well.</i>

32:45.480 --> 32:47.880
<i>Strikers are all selfish</i>
<i>and I'm no different,</i>

32:47.960 --> 32:49.280
<i>so part of you is thinking,</i>

32:49.360 --> 32:51.280
I've taken us to the
Premier League.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.080
League, baby!

32:54.160 --> 32:55.600
I don't know what to
say right know.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.760
It's just a dream come true
to be promoted with

32:57.840 --> 33:00.480
this group of players,
this group of fans.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.200
It's just... It's been my life,
so, yeah, been a pleasure.

33:07.840 --> 33:09.920
<i>It's amazing, really,</i>
<i>the whole season's work</i>

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
and it felt like the whole
last ten years for that moment.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.920
For all the ups and downs,
for all the trials and tribulations

33:18.000 --> 33:20.280
there was just something
about that team,

33:20.360 --> 33:24.000
about that group of players,
about the mentality of the club

33:24.080 --> 33:26.760
at that point,
about where we'd come from,

33:26.840 --> 33:30.200
the administrations,
the pain, the heartache.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.680
I remember I was in tears, man.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.160
Bottom of the Championship
at the start of the season.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.560
Get promoted
to the Premier League.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.360
You couldn't dream it
if you wanted to.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.120
<i>I was ecstatic, happy,</i>

33:42.200 --> 33:44.480
<i>but mentally and physically,</i>
<i>emotionally,</i>

33:44.560 --> 33:46.760
I was drained, relief
that we did it.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.200
<i>Whether they were</i>
<i>having me at the start,</i>

33:50.280 --> 33:52.640
<i>after the final</i>
<i>I knew they were.</i>

33:53.080 --> 33:54.320
<i>How you feeling?</i>

33:54.400 --> 33:57.880
<i>It's unbelievable,</i>
<i>I just don't believe it.</i>

33:57.960 --> 33:59.880
I gotta get going,
yeah, I'll call later.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.880
-Mile!
-Let's go.

34:02.320 --> 34:05.880
<i>That man there, Jedinak, was simply</i>
<i>monstrous throughout the game.</i>

34:05.960 --> 34:08.440
<i>Talk about heart, desire,</i>
<i>dragging yourself over the line.</i>

34:08.520 --> 34:10.400
<i>It was Jedinak</i>
<i>who did that to his team.</i>

34:10.480 --> 34:14.480
<i>Huge massive sense of adrenaline</i>
<i>and achievement that you get.</i>

34:14.560 --> 34:17.040
it almost feels like
a wonderful dream already.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.680
It was just a beautiful
feeling, man.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.840
Finally after eight years,

34:20.920 --> 34:24.240
we were back and it really felt like
we were a forgotten team, you know?

34:24.320 --> 34:26.400
People were doubting them,
doubting the players,

34:26.480 --> 34:30.000
<i>and they showed a great resolve</i>
<i>in strength, in character.</i>

34:30.080 --> 34:32.560
<i>Such a volatile season.</i>

34:32.640 --> 34:35.320
People writing us off
at the beginning as relegation fodder.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.360
It's lovely to prove
people wrong.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.200
As ever with Palace,
so many things were packed

34:39.280 --> 34:41.600
into a short space
of time that you kinda think,

34:41.880 --> 34:44.360
"Did that really
happen this season?"

34:44.440 --> 34:46.600
<i>We talked about his playoff</i>
<i>Midas touch,</i>

34:46.680 --> 34:48.360
<i>well, he has done it here again</i>

34:48.440 --> 34:51.680
<i>as he guides Crystal Palace</i>
<i>back to the big time.</i>

34:51.760 --> 34:53.880
<i>So many people</i>
<i>get Ian Holloway wrong.</i>

34:53.960 --> 34:57.360
<i>People can quote</i>
<i>his off kilter one-liners.</i>

34:57.440 --> 34:58.960
They don't see beyond that.

34:59.040 --> 35:03.960
I think he's a thoughtful,
intelligent football manager.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.360
<i>And it's almost three years ago</i>
<i>to the day</i>

35:06.440 --> 35:09.200
<i>that Crystal Palace fans</i>
<i>were busy protesting</i>

35:09.280 --> 35:11.760
<i>outside the headquarters</i>
<i>of Lloyds Bank.</i>

35:11.840 --> 35:13.600
<i>The club was facing liquidation.</i>

35:13.680 --> 35:16.760
A terrific fairy-tale
for where we were three years previous.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.800
It's been just epic, really.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.920
Three years ago,
almost to the day,

35:22.000 --> 35:23.480
<i>we were going into liquidation.</i>

35:23.560 --> 35:25.240
<i>From a phone call</i>
<i>saying, you know,</i>

35:25.320 --> 35:26.640
are you interested
in getting involved, to that.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.120
If you had drawn
that as a business plan,

35:28.200 --> 35:29.640
nobody would have believed you.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.080
<i>You know they would've said,</i>
<i>"You're not gonna do it."</i>

35:31.160 --> 35:32.560
<i>And I'm just so happy</i>

35:33.120 --> 35:35.120
<i>that we've ended up</i>
<i>where we have ended up.</i>

35:35.200 --> 35:37.840
And I think we deserve
that, actually.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.920
Really achieved something
a bit special here.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.680
<i>They had been deducted</i>
<i>10 points.</i>

35:41.760 --> 35:43.400
<i>They were in administration.</i>

35:43.480 --> 35:46.160
<i>You might remember</i>
<i>that final day effective playoff</i>

35:46.240 --> 35:49.040
<i>against Sheffield Wednesday</i>
<i>to stay in this league.</i>

35:49.120 --> 35:51.280
<i>Things were looking</i>
<i>very, very bleak.</i>

35:51.960 --> 35:55.760
<i>Today is Crystal Palace's day,</i>
<i>no doubt about that.</i>

35:57.360 --> 35:58.800
<i>1989, they did it.</i>

35:58.880 --> 36:00.480
<i>1997, they did it.</i>

36:00.560 --> 36:04.600
<i>2004, now 2013.</i>

36:05.240 --> 36:07.520
<i>No one has won</i>
<i>as many playoff finals</i>

36:07.600 --> 36:09.160
<i>as Crystal Palace have.</i>

36:09.240 --> 36:11.120
<i>They have done it again.</i>

36:13.480 --> 36:17.400
<i>For the first time since 2005,</i>
<i>they're back,</i>

36:18.040 --> 36:19.720
<i>back among the top 20.</i>

36:20.760 --> 36:24.000
<i>They have their hands</i>
<i>on the resources that so many clubs</i>

36:24.080 --> 36:25.800
<i>only dreamed of.</i>

36:25.880 --> 36:27.840
<i>Back from the brink of oblivion,</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:30.560
<i>through administration</i>
<i>3.5 years ago.</i>

36:31.160 --> 36:34.440
<i>This is a date</i>
<i>that will always be etched</i>

36:34.520 --> 36:38.760
<i>in Crystal Palace history,</i>
<i>May 27th, 2013.</i>

36:38.840 --> 36:41.120
Trophy was getting
passed along the line

36:41.200 --> 36:43.520
and me and Damo,
we just got sick of standing there

36:43.600 --> 36:45.520
<i>and realize that nobody</i>
<i>else was following us.</i>

36:45.600 --> 36:46.560
<i>Thought I might as well wait.</i>

36:46.640 --> 36:47.960
He just sat down
and just...

36:48.040 --> 36:49.440
started you know breaking down.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.680
<i>Look at that,</i>
<i>he's a big, strong, hard man.</i>

37:04.760 --> 37:06.040
<i>Look at the emotion.</i>

37:06.200 --> 37:09.160
<i>He cannot believe</i>
<i>what Crystal Palace have done.</i>

37:09.240 --> 37:12.240
It was quite hard to watch.
I'd never seen Damo like that.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.240
Big Irish hard man who's...
cuts all over his face

37:15.320 --> 37:16.360
<i>even though</i>
<i>he's a pretty young man.</i>

37:16.440 --> 37:18.120
<i>We'd put so much into it,</i>

37:18.200 --> 37:20.880
and you're kinda living
on the edge for so long,

37:20.960 --> 37:22.920
all the negativity
that was creeping in.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
We didn't even know
the camera was there.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.840
It was just two mates
just sitting there.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.280
Me trying to console him.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.880
<i>The one thing I did remember,</i>
<i>he said that,</i>

37:30.960 --> 37:32.640
<i>you know, something like this</i>
<i>shouldn't happen to me.</i>

37:32.720 --> 37:34.480
<i>And I was like, Damo,</i>
<i>you've deserved it.</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:36.240
<i>Like he'd never been</i>
<i>promoted in his career.</i>

37:36.320 --> 37:38.120
He'd obviously come
at the start of the season

37:38.200 --> 37:41.240
from nobody wanting him,
he was gonna retire.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.760
Fast forward nine, ten months,
and we're both sitting

37:43.840 --> 37:45.840
on the end of the
steps at Wembley

37:45.920 --> 37:48.720
and just having a moment
between the two of us,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.960
and it wasn't two teammates,
it was just two mates.

37:51.040 --> 37:54.800
Not realizing that it was getting beamed
on the Wembley screens.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.280
And I didn't even realize,
it was until my mom and dad

37:57.360 --> 37:59.640
after the game was like,
my mom was in tears saying,

37:59.720 --> 38:01.600
"I can't believe
what's just happened."

38:02.120 --> 38:03.200
<i>"Yeah, we got promoted, Mum."</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:06.680
<i>Up until that point,</i>
<i>maybe he lost</i>

38:06.760 --> 38:08.200
<i>a bit of love for the game.</i>

38:08.280 --> 38:10.320
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>an incredible sense of pride</i>

38:10.400 --> 38:12.040
for the role that he had,

38:12.120 --> 38:15.800
and he had a very special,
special role along with Mile,

38:15.880 --> 38:17.760
he was a real
setter of an example

38:17.840 --> 38:19.240
and a leader of the group.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.440
No one could feel more
of a sense of pride

38:22.520 --> 38:23.440
than those players.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.000
We all do our bit,

38:25.080 --> 38:27.720
but at the end, 16 guys,

38:29.000 --> 38:30.240
they have to perform.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.640
It's their victory,
it's their moment.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.440
I'm gonna be selfish
in saying this,

38:35.520 --> 38:37.160
I think this is probably
one of the most

38:37.680 --> 38:39.240
iconic images of that season,

38:39.320 --> 38:41.280
because that's just
two mates there.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.080
<i>It was like the whole group.</i>

38:43.160 --> 38:45.280
<i>It could've been any two of us</i>
<i>throughout that squad</i>

38:45.360 --> 38:47.080
<i>sitting there having</i>
<i>that conversation</i>

38:47.160 --> 38:48.920
<i>because I think that's</i>
<i>how close we were.</i>

38:49.000 --> 38:50.480
A relief of the effort.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.280
The ups and downs,
the trials and tribulations.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.560
The managers going,

38:54.640 --> 38:57.800
the form going up
and the form going down

38:57.880 --> 39:01.240
and through all of it,
we battled our way

39:01.880 --> 39:03.240
<i>to the Premier League.</i>

39:06.840 --> 39:08.240
Yes!

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
And it's a really, really tough thing

39:10.400 --> 39:12.400
to achieve at a football club, I think.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.840
Getting... Well, I would say
90% of the players

39:14.920 --> 39:16.280
to buy into that culture.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.640
<i>He was instrumental, I think,</i>

39:17.720 --> 39:19.920
<i>in the way he managed</i>
<i>that situation.</i>

39:20.000 --> 39:23.240
I never ever dreamed that I'd be involved
in the Premier League.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.760
Certainly not as a player
because I knew I wasn't good enough.

39:25.840 --> 39:29.640
So to be there as a member of staff
was the next best thing.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.680
<i>I think whenever you achieve</i>
<i>in football, for me,</i>

39:42.760 --> 39:46.280
it's not so much about celebrating,
but just that moment of calm

39:46.360 --> 39:49.600
and knowing that you've done your job
and it's just that moment of peace.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.760
<i>That was so touching,</i>
<i>that memory,</i>

40:06.840 --> 40:08.800
<i>when the players</i>
<i>came to him with the champagne.</i>

40:08.880 --> 40:10.560
It was so clear
that this was a group of players

40:10.640 --> 40:12.240
who seem to get on well
with each other.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.400
<i>We had our backs against the wall</i>
<i>and we've come out fighting</i>

40:14.840 --> 40:17.160
and that's something
that was in ingrained

40:17.240 --> 40:20.400
in the club, you know,
the time in and time out.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.840
Proved a lot of people wrong.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.560
<i>Now we're back and it's just a great time</i>
<i>to show people</i>

40:38.640 --> 40:39.560
what we're about.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.000
We're more than just strugglers,

40:41.080 --> 40:42.280
we're more than just minnows,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.920
<i>we're more than</i>
<i>just making up the numbers.</i>

40:45.000 --> 40:47.680
<i>We're a special club,</i>
<i>with a special history.</i>

40:47.760 --> 40:50.720
<i>Palace was, at that time,</i>
<i>those memories there,</i>

40:50.800 --> 40:52.360
<i>we used all of that</i>
<i>to our advantage.</i>

40:52.440 --> 40:54.880
<i>I'm glad all the other players</i>
<i>could embrace that as well.</i>

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
<i>Because without that...</i>

40:56.960 --> 40:58.960
who knows?
Who knows how it would've turned out?

41:00.120 --> 41:02.040
<i>I think, you know,</i>
<i>quite a few promotions...</i>

41:02.120 --> 41:03.920
<i>when I've analysed the squads,</i>

41:04.000 --> 41:06.680
<i>you do need that blend</i>
<i>of experience and youth.</i>

41:06.760 --> 41:08.720
For us it was spot
on that season.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.920
Yeah! Get in there!

41:21.000 --> 41:23.480
Whenever I think
about Palace times, I just... like...

41:23.560 --> 41:25.960
My little one always just, like,
"Are you going back to Palace?

41:26.040 --> 41:28.000
'Cause obviously,
his favourite player is Wilf.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.760
And my family and stuff,

41:30.840 --> 41:32.040
when they remind me
of things like that,

41:32.120 --> 41:35.440
I just smile
because I had so much fun there.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.200
<i>Coming down from the Premier League,</i>
<i>I never knew the championship that well.</i>

41:51.280 --> 41:55.240
<i>I thought, "Okay, we should be favourites</i>
<i>to go straight back up"</i>

41:56.240 --> 42:00.520
and it took us about seven-eight years
to then finally do that.

42:00.600 --> 42:04.400
So to finally get there,
it was an amazing achievement.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.520
But of course, yeah, I'm proud of...
No, not just that,

42:07.600 --> 42:10.400
but also spending 15
years at the club.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.320
And I'm proud when I meet people
outside football now

42:13.400 --> 42:17.200
<i>and I see them in the supermarket</i>
<i>or walking around the neighbourhood</i>

42:17.680 --> 42:19.680
and they actually thank me
for what I've done as well,

42:19.760 --> 42:22.920
it was my job, you have nothing to thank,
it was my job.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.520
And that makes you proud

42:24.600 --> 42:27.360
and it's something that will stay with me

42:27.440 --> 42:28.640
until the day I die, really.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.520
<i>The makeup of the team</i>
<i>that Dougie put together,</i>

42:51.600 --> 42:55.200
the vision that Dougie had,
was absolutely brilliant.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.840
<i>Garvs, he was exceptional</i>
<i>throughout the season,</i>

42:57.920 --> 42:58.960
<i>doesn't get enough credit.</i>

42:59.600 --> 43:02.400
<i>KG, Jonathan Parr,</i>

43:02.480 --> 43:06.040
<i>Danny Gabbidon, you know, silky,</i>
<i>Rolls-Royce of a footballer.</i>

43:06.120 --> 43:08.560
<i>Damien Delaney, you know,</i>
<i>with the booming left foot</i>

43:08.640 --> 43:11.560
<i>and a big presence,</i>
<i>all discarded, remember.</i>

43:11.640 --> 43:13.840
This season meant that
you then went on and played

43:13.920 --> 43:15.880
four seasons in the
Premier League.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.240
Yeah, I often think about that.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.880
Not very long,
but I do think about it a little bit.

43:21.960 --> 43:23.680
I just put it down
to fate, really.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.760
I'm not particularly religious
or anything like that but,

43:26.840 --> 43:28.640
I think if you make enough
good decisions in your life

43:28.720 --> 43:31.480
and you do the right thing often enough,
good things happen.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.600
Luckily I got rewarded in the end,
but I paid for it

43:33.680 --> 43:36.800
with the four years previous
at QPR and Ipswich, so...

43:36.880 --> 43:39.080
Maybe there was a God rewarding me
for something there.

43:50.360 --> 43:54.040
<i>Rambo, just exceptional person.</i>

43:54.120 --> 43:57.600
He said to me the night
of the playoff final, after we'd won,

43:57.680 --> 43:59.720
"I know I'm not going to play
in the Premier League,

43:59.800 --> 44:01.120
but I don't care,

44:01.200 --> 44:03.400
it's the best group of people
I've ever worked with.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.960
Best experience ever
had in my life.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.720
Loved every minute of it."

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
-That season?
-Yeah.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.960
The best, for me.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.400
It was the only season that I can sit
back on my career

44:14.480 --> 44:16.760
<i>and say I played a significant part</i>
<i>in a successful side.</i>

44:17.200 --> 44:20.440
More so for the fact that
I'd speak to this group of players

44:20.520 --> 44:23.040
more than I speak to any other players,
still to this day.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.120
And I bet quite a few of them
will say the same thing.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.760
It was just a group of wrong 'uns
that were brought together

44:27.840 --> 44:30.960
and just somehow had something
in common that they had

44:31.040 --> 44:34.000
a point to prove
and I think we made that point.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.280
I'd keep the camera on him,
Probably will.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.160
Good dancer to be fair...

44:55.240 --> 44:58.120
<i>What kind of receptions you get from</i>
<i>Palace fans when you chat to them?</i>

44:58.200 --> 45:01.440
One of them said, "Thanks for leaving,"
which was nice.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.800
Thanks, mate.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.960
But that's football isn't it?

45:08.040 --> 45:10.640
<i>It's an amazing thing,</i>
<i>I'm very, very proud of my time here,</i>

45:10.720 --> 45:13.840
<i>I'm very proud of where</i>
<i>the club is.</i>

45:13.920 --> 45:15.200
<i>All I can say is "Well done."</i>

45:15.280 --> 45:17.240
<i>Well done to Steve,</i>
<i>well done to everybody,</i>

45:17.320 --> 45:20.600
well done to Dougie coming back,
more importantly, the players.

45:20.680 --> 45:24.200
So in all, that's what I get
from Palace fans,

45:24.280 --> 45:26.720
"Thanks ever so much,
thanks for when you were there,

45:26.800 --> 45:30.360
thanks for leaving
and thanks for your part in it."

45:31.000 --> 45:33.960
So whatever part that is,
I know I'm very proud of it, so.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.560
I was delighted,
it was my team.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.400
My kids are Palace fans,

45:51.480 --> 45:54.200
so you know they were
very, very happy.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.280
The goal that was set,
they achieved the goal.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.040
There was never really any doubt
I felt when they got to the playoffs,

45:59.120 --> 46:00.480
that's what was gonna happen.

46:10.440 --> 46:13.320
To play alongside that,
to be part of it, to captain them,

46:13.400 --> 46:16.480
to be teammates, to be mates,
to be friends,

46:16.560 --> 46:18.960
it was all a fantastic privilege
for me at the time,

46:19.040 --> 46:22.480
but I just knew that this group
was really, really special

46:22.560 --> 46:25.680
and ultimately we got...
we got our rewards.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.960
<i>It was fantastic to do it</i>
<i>so relatively quickly</i>

46:48.040 --> 46:52.120
after being on the verge
of relegation in to League One.

46:52.200 --> 46:55.360
And to do that, that season was,
it was amazing.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.200
Isn't just a story
of Crystal Palace,

47:09.280 --> 47:12.520
it's a story of those people,
those individuals.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.160
Every single one of these people

47:14.240 --> 47:17.400
has got something to
prove to someone.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.480
There was something
special about that

47:19.560 --> 47:22.680
and you could feel it as we were
putting it all together.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.240
So as much as it was a great thing
for the club,

47:25.320 --> 47:28.280
it was just brilliant
for those guys

47:29.240 --> 47:31.240
to see how they all
came together,

47:31.320 --> 47:35.280
created something that was greater
than the sum of its parts.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.080
So yeah, real big sense
of achievement,

47:38.960 --> 47:41.480
but more just pleasure
for everybody connected with it,

47:41.560 --> 47:43.480
everybody involved in the club,

47:43.560 --> 47:45.480
from where we'd come
from to there.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.600
It was just
such a brilliant journey.

48:11.920 --> 48:15.080
<i>I just wanted to play for Palace</i>
<i>and wanted to win.</i>

48:15.160 --> 48:18.320
Never dreamt of playing
for Palace first team,

48:18.400 --> 48:19.880
let alone playing for them
in the Premiership.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.040
That's all I've ever wished for

48:22.120 --> 48:24.680
when I started playing football here,

48:24.760 --> 48:28.400
When I was about eight,
and to achieve that was massive.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.120
<i>At the time I was thinking,</i>

48:49.200 --> 48:50.680
<i>"Oh, my days I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to play against Palace",</i>

48:51.000 --> 48:52.960
<i>which is crazy, I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to play against these lads.</i>

48:53.240 --> 48:54.920
I was just happy and excited

48:55.000 --> 48:58.480
for my own future
and the club's future.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.520
<i>Somebody described</i>
<i>to me a while back,</i>

49:36.600 --> 49:39.800
<i>you know, an old jigsaw that had been</i>
<i>just left to rot somewhere</i>

49:39.880 --> 49:41.560
and all of a sudden
you just find all the pieces

49:41.640 --> 49:43.480
and you put them together,
there, you've got a beautiful picture.

49:43.560 --> 49:47.440
<i>And that's what it did feel like,</i>
<i>it was just a group of misfits</i>

49:47.520 --> 49:49.160
<i>that somehow came together</i>

49:49.240 --> 49:51.040
<i>and built a complete jigsaw</i>

49:51.120 --> 49:53.880
<i>of the promotion and</i>
<i>lifting the trophy.</i>
