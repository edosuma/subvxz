WEBVTT

00:06.007 --> 00:07.247
LAUREN: Did you just say destiny?!

00:07.466 --> 00:09.548
TRICK: If you have something
to settle, settle it with me.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.920
TRICK: Not my granddaughter.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.297
BO: Did you not hear
what I just said?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.593
LAUREN: He's brainwashed you!

00:13.806 --> 00:15.091
BO: Can you please trust
me, any of you?

00:15.308 --> 00:16.548
LAUREN: Trick, what is going on?

00:16.767 --> 00:18.098
DYSON: I'll take care
of this. Bo, get back!

00:18.311 --> 00:20.347
BO: No you need to get
back. All of you.

00:20.563 --> 00:21.552
LAUREN: Trick, Trick!

00:26.694 --> 00:30.687
It had to be done.
They didn't give us a choice.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.530
l have been pulling
ninety-hour weeks

00:40.750 --> 00:43.492
to make this the biggest
mobile launch since the iPhone.

00:43.711 --> 00:47.295
One more delay from you or
any of your Ivy League morons

00:47.506 --> 00:50.122
and Darren will have
you sliced in two.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.792
Good.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.627
You're a doll.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.632
(sighs)

01:32.426 --> 01:35.463
(muffled screeches)

01:38.432 --> 01:44.723
(screaming)

01:45.856 --> 01:48.643
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are,

01:48.859 --> 01:51.646
it's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.604
My love carries
a death sentence.

01:54.824 --> 01:59.739
I was lost for years,
searching while hiding.

01:59.954 --> 02:03.822
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.497
I won 't hide anymore.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.747
I will live the life I choose.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.170
We should never have let
her get on that train alone.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.470
We should have protected her.

02:20.683 --> 02:21.968
She doesn't want
our protection Dyson,

02:22.184 --> 02:23.720
she doesn't
even want to see us.

02:23.936 --> 02:24.971
She's not thinking straight.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.269
It's got to be a
possession or a spell.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.062
|just-- I need
to examine her.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.811
That's it,
I'm gonna go get her.

02:31.027 --> 02:32.642
But she doesn't
want us to Dyson.

02:32.862 --> 02:33.442
I don't care.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.612
Dyson she locked us out.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.315
Bo locked us out.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.493
(smash)

02:42.705 --> 02:44.821
Aaaaaand we're
breaking things.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.747
Giant coffees!
Come and get 'em!

02:46.959 --> 02:49.291
Who could possibly need
that much caffeine?

02:49.503 --> 02:53.121
Us! We! We're taking a
case. Can I get a wha' wha'.

02:53.341 --> 02:53.796
What?

02:54.008 --> 02:54.713
What?

02:54.925 --> 02:56.426
Okay, not what I had in mind.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.296
Kenzi, it's not
really a good time.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.013
A woman's legs
went missing, dudes!

03:00.222 --> 03:01.883
Like miiiiissssing. Okay?

03:02.099 --> 03:04.476
She was swimming in her
company pool, and then BAM!

03:04.685 --> 03:05.549
Legless in Pool-attle.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.805
What's the company called?

03:07.021 --> 03:08.386
Alaria Tech. Biometrics.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.598
Like "I, Robot" shit. So we need
to get to the bottom of this.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.273
And, get that
bottom half... back.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.772
Yeah, Bo's kind of our
only case right now Kenz.

03:15.988 --> 03:16.943
Yeah, well Bo's
made it quite clear that

03:17.156 --> 03:19.613
she wants us off her case.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.532
So, uh, she said she'd talk to
us tomorrow. When she's ready.

03:22.745 --> 03:26.363
Tamsin's resting, recovering.
So I packed a weekend bag.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.291
Holla, we're gonna
give Bo some elbow room.

03:30.503 --> 03:31.834
How do we trust him?

03:32.046 --> 03:35.288
We don't. And believe me, I
am not happy about this either.

03:35.508 --> 03:37.794
You know new guy comes
along, girl drops her friends.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.796
Classic suckage.

03:40.012 --> 03:43.925
But we gotta trust our
girl. Respect Bo's decision.

03:50.815 --> 03:53.101
I'm so glad
you guys could help.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.682
Grab a coffee, don't be shy.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.035
Bo?

04:07.248 --> 04:09.739
Is everything okay?

04:09.959 --> 04:12.951
I need to understand.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.547
What if this was a mistake?

04:18.717 --> 04:21.333
I want to trust you, I do.

04:21.554 --> 04:25.968
I never imagined I'd be
on this physical plane again.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.801
I had to go back to the
train willingly to save you.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.227
And I did.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.477
I went Dark for you.
I did the impossible.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.184
But this. What we did...

04:38.404 --> 04:40.235
Was just as necessary.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.778
Kenzi, Dyson, Lauren, Trick.
I'm sorry, they--

04:45.995 --> 04:50.113
Just need time. And so do |.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.618
You said once we remembered,
you would talk to them.

04:52.835 --> 04:56.168
I know. But not yet.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.245
The memories are
back, the feelings.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.879
But now that we're here,
in the real world together,

05:02.094 --> 05:04.380
in my world...

05:04.597 --> 05:10.433
I need to understand.
Really understand.

05:26.827 --> 05:31.036
(record playing)

05:31.248 --> 05:35.412
You have harassed my friends.
Stalked and kidnapped me.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.835
And you just blew
up my favorite pub.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.628
So let's get
to it, Wanderer.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.724
Be still my heart...

05:54.104 --> 05:56.140
Another brunette.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.269
I am so sick of this song.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.100
Who the hell are you?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.935
(music stops)

06:03.989 --> 06:06.366
Hey, I'm talking to you.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.361
I came all the
way via black smoke,

06:08.577 --> 06:10.317
I think I deserve
an explanation.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.280
Well sweetheart,
you've got two choices.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.831
One. You can stay, I can
pretend to court you,

06:16.043 --> 06:19.410
get bored with you
and send you away.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.666
Two, you can get off
at the next stop.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.589
Either way you'll
forget everything.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.302
(music plays)

06:29.515 --> 06:30.300
Here's option three.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.801
(music cuts)

06:32.726 --> 06:36.719
You tell me why
you kidnapped me.

06:36.939 --> 06:41.103
I don't know why you are
here. Seriously, I don't.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.603
Next question?

06:44.154 --> 06:48.944
Why go through all of this
trouble just to send me away?

06:49.159 --> 06:53.243
If you wanted some epic fight,
some battle of wits, some...

06:53.455 --> 06:56.788
sweeping romance, you're
on the wrong train.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.992
Nothing to see here.
Move it along.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.248
Handmaiden.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.051
Take uh...

07:10.264 --> 07:13.347
Bo. My name is Bo.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.548
Take Bo to her chambers,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.019
she'll be getting
off at the next stop,

07:16.228 --> 07:17.968
if she knows
what's good for her.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.744
No thanks.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.948
Your scent is faint
but you are Fae.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.285
Orphaned pixie. Raised by
humans, in the human world.

07:42.504 --> 07:45.291
As if that wasn't already
random enough, now this.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.714
It's very inconvenient.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.962
That's one way to put it.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.794
Well exclusive access
to the corporate pool

07:52.014 --> 07:53.470
would indicate an inside job.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.140
Is there any sort of
suspicious research going on?

07:57.353 --> 07:59.139
I'm handed a product
and | market it.

07:59.355 --> 08:01.846
How it's actually
made is a mystery.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.602
Darren Clare
would be your guy.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.523
He's the head of
Product Development.

08:06.070 --> 08:08.311
Now there's a
man with secrets.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.069
Thank you. I really
appreciate this.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.570
And I appreciate your
Tahiti Sunset manicure.

08:14.787 --> 08:17.028
I'm a Tahiti
Sunrise girl, myself.

08:17.247 --> 08:17.781
Sharp eye.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.989
Hm. You hired the best.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.790
Now kids. Let's get corporate.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.789
We got saucy microwaves.
Grabby managers. Drip coffee.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.165
How we doin' this?

08:26.382 --> 08:28.839
Actually I've set up two
temp corporate profiles.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.383
Okay well how about
Kenzi and I take the field.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.505
I've been training her.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.463
As a shadow thief.
Check your panties.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.389
Anyone missing any panties?

08:39.520 --> 08:42.387
You have got to
stop doing that.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.437
I did not teach
her to do that.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.436
Kenzi, I think you'll
fit in just fine

08:46.652 --> 08:48.608
as mail distribution
and maintenance.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.779
Offended. Moving on.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.779
Dyson, you'll go in
as Efficiency Consultant.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.451
Now listen, this building
is rigged with the latest

08:58.664 --> 09:00.029
heat sensor security.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.490
If either one of you gets a
little... flustered or nervous,

09:02.710 --> 09:05.326
big brother is alerted.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.128
l have managed to hack you
into the heat signature system.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.127
So you can monitor
yourselves or any suspects.

09:11.343 --> 09:14.460
Just remember to
stay alert, calm,

09:14.680 --> 09:17.387
most importantly, blend in.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.353
Can you believe Diana
got our roles wrong?

09:32.573 --> 09:33.403
Shocking.

09:33.615 --> 09:36.197
What, I never
get to wear a suit.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.025
Here's your mail workin' girl.

09:41.582 --> 09:42.617
(earphone fuzz)

09:42.833 --> 09:44.164
What is that noise?

09:45.753 --> 09:49.041
Sorry I was eliminating some
potentially harmful bacteria.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.872
You know, E. coli, enteritis,
salmonella, that kind of thing.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.798
Sorry. What do you see?
What's happening?

09:54.011 --> 09:56.343
Well, we're basically
in a yogurt commercial.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.675
How's the heat
monitor working?

09:59.892 --> 10:02.304
Um... Looks like I'm
the hottest one around.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.020
I like this gadget!

10:04.229 --> 10:05.730
You're hot 'cause
you're excited Kenz,

10:05.939 --> 10:08.646
you gotta stay calm or
you're gonna alert security.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.770
Okay, delivering
mail to Darren Clare.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.101
Standby.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.447
I don't think so.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.991
No one delivers anything
directly to Mr. Clare.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.410
Not even me.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.613
Why, is there some sort of
secret mail slot or something?

10:23.832 --> 10:25.618
Yes.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.293
Oh how clumsy of me.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.050
Aren't you a little unkempt
for a corporate setting?

10:37.262 --> 10:39.298
Aren't you a little nasal
to be answering phones?

10:39.515 --> 10:40.095
I am not--

10:40.307 --> 10:41.012
Ouch!

10:41.225 --> 10:43.841
Dyson: one.
Man Drescher: zero.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.801
Heat band-aid secured.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.602
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

10:47.815 --> 10:48.770
Ah, yes. lt's registering!

10:48.982 --> 10:49.482
Kenzi?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.477
Mail is on the move.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.522
Unfortunately, I'm being
stalked like a celebrity

10:54.738 --> 10:56.023
at a Whole Foods parking lot.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.776
You need to get
into that vent system

10:57.991 --> 10:59.777
to track that mail
before we lose heat.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.403
Okay, I'm gonna
distract the guard.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.906
|'|| record myself on a camera
that cousin Dimitri provided

11:04.122 --> 11:05.532
that also doubles
as a projector.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.865
|'|| install a screen
in front of my desk--

11:08.085 --> 11:10.417
Yeah, I don't think we should
be trusting Gypsy technology.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.790
Just give me,
uh, give me twenty.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.630
Or we could just do that.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.049
You're welcome.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.469
Okay, I am getting my vent on.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.545
If this goes Aliens,

11:21.765 --> 11:23.847
I am Sigourney
Weavering outta there.

11:30.148 --> 11:30.432
Eugh!

11:30.649 --> 11:30.853
(thump)

11:31.066 --> 11:31.896
Kenz?

11:32.109 --> 11:32.894
(groans)

11:33.110 --> 11:35.522
That was way more graceful
than it sounded, I swear.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.352
Kenzi. Do you have a visual?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.231
Legs.

11:40.993 --> 11:43.200
Lots and lots of legs.

11:50.043 --> 11:55.379
Long, lean. Sculpted calves.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.092
Looks like someone
never missed squat day.

12:00.304 --> 12:00.918
(clunk)

12:01.138 --> 12:02.799
(gasps) Someone's here.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.305
(clunk)

12:09.980 --> 12:11.265
Okay, false alarm.
No one's here.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.096
It's just Darren's mail.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.605
A lot of mail.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.278
Okay, what do we got here?

12:21.575 --> 12:24.408
We got a subscription
to Chez Lounge.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.495
Oh, hello.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.086
Medical bills for Tad.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.419
We're talking like six
figures. And a lot of them.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.925
Darren's assistant?
What's he being treated for?

12:46.975 --> 12:52.470
Uh... Perry-floral
somethin'-somethin', I dunno.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.772
Why don't I just take a
picture and send it to you.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.099
How you doin, D?

12:57.319 --> 12:59.935
Lauren I'm sending
you some visuals to scan.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.770
Yeah, I'm looking at them.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.106
That plant. I need
you to bring me one.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.988
|t's unusual and
possibly aquatic.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.365
Flowers for my
favourite doctor.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.912
Coming up.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.241
Okay! Playful banter
between duelling exes?!

13:17.464 --> 13:20.126
It's a salt water pool.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.552
I found a pearl in
the filtration system.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.723
Oh! I'm calling dibs.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.722
If it's not
evidence I want it.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.189
Am I interrupting?

13:41.405 --> 13:43.441
Frankly, yes.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.147
Oh my, you're sweating.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.949
Well that's what happens when |
gear up to kick handmaiden ass.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.948
Which I will do if you
don't help me off this train.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.495
Next stop's not for three days.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.288
Leave when it's stopped
without an elemental,

13:57.504 --> 14:00.792
and you'll get transcendental
sickness and die.

14:01.717 --> 14:04.800
Now. Shall we freshen you up?

14:08.932 --> 14:10.433
In your size...

14:12.269 --> 14:14.851
You'll look ravishing.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.519
I'm not really
into looking ravishing

14:16.732 --> 14:18.097
for someone who kidnapped me.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.649
Oh, please stop
looking at it that way.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.194
There's no other
way to see it!

14:24.406 --> 14:25.441
If he wasn't so pathetic

14:25.657 --> 14:27.739
I would have thrown
him off his own train.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.784
I know it might not seem
like it on the surface but,

14:30.996 --> 14:32.486
he is a great man.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.913
Give him a chance.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.706
Give us all a chance.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.955
Believe it or not?
We need you.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.675
Dinner? With the Wanderer?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.132
His name is Rainer.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.301
And you do look hungry.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.023
DYSON: Then why aren't you
doing this from the comfort

15:06.239 --> 15:07.490
of your new Dark digs?

15:07.699 --> 15:12.409
I wanted to be here with you
guys, close to all the action.

15:12.621 --> 15:15.488
Has Bo called, pool boy?

15:15.707 --> 15:16.787
Not yet, no.

15:17.834 --> 15:18.334
Kenz?

15:18.543 --> 15:19.874
Not yet, but she will.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.796
We gotta have George Michael
faith-a, faith-a, faith-ahhh.

15:24.007 --> 15:29.843
It's not a pearl... It's
a crystallized salt deposit.

15:30.055 --> 15:33.013
Did you just say
crystallized salt deposit?

15:33.225 --> 15:36.763
Can that sentence be mistaken
for some other sentence?

15:36.978 --> 15:37.603
Dammit!

15:37.813 --> 15:38.643
Why, what's going on?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.436
We should never
have taken this case.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.105
Kenzi, you need
to get out of there.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.773
But we haven't solved it yet!

15:43.985 --> 15:45.771
Doesn't matter,
get out. Do you copy?

15:45.987 --> 15:47.238
What is it Dyson?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.270
A flesh eater?

15:49.491 --> 15:50.606
Sharknado?

15:50.826 --> 15:51.781
Worse.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.447
Mermaids.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.780
(gaSPS)

15:57.999 --> 15:58.829
Mermaids.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.285
Fued?

16:03.505 --> 16:05.791
Eighty thousand dollars a year
to gossip by a toaster oven?

16:06.007 --> 16:06.666
Yeah. Fired.

16:06.883 --> 16:06.962
But--

16:07.175 --> 16:09.257
Uh, zip. Zip.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.715
Oh my god. Mermaids?
I love mermaids!

16:12.931 --> 16:14.796
But like, love them.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.677
They are the psychopaths
of the sea, Kenz.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.508
"The Seas Have Eyes"
is their cultural motto.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.593
l have lied awake
at night my entire life

16:20.814 --> 16:22.850
thinking of the marvellous
mer-day when I would meet

16:23.066 --> 16:25.398
a fin-flapping, sea-shell-bra
wearing, Daryl Hannah--

16:25.610 --> 16:26.770
Oh my god.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.729
They are a rare
and fascinating species.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.609
Yeah. They comb
their hair with forks!

16:31.825 --> 16:33.611
Yeah, right after they
stab you in the face with them.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.363
Just before they
blow up your ship that's

16:35.579 --> 16:36.864
en route to the new world.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.866
Yeah but then they
sing duets with crabs?

16:39.082 --> 16:40.288
No, they don't, Kenz.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.001
This is not a
children's movie.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.371
Okay fine. But if they're that
bad, don't you think the good

16:44.588 --> 16:48.251
people of Alaria deserve
the chance to be mermaid-free?

16:48.466 --> 16:49.592
She's right.

16:51.469 --> 16:56.589
Fine, but we have to be careful.
They could be anywhere.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.633
(small squeal)

17:02.314 --> 17:04.521
Your Handmaiden likes
playing matchmaker.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.689
She's usually better at it.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.438
Other dates
bothered to dress up.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.359
Play into the fairy tale.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.938
Whereas you look like
you're here to assassinate me.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.951
I am not looking
for happily ever after.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.951
l have that at home.
With my family, my friends.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.998
You know, the people
you stole me from.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.044
Congratulations. But again,
I didn't bring you here.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.587
Is there sauce for this?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.710
What do you
want with me, Rainer?

17:35.305 --> 17:37.136
The handmaiden
told you my name.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.762
Yeah, and now you're gonna
tell me everything else.

17:40.977 --> 17:41.932
Agh.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.018
You think you can come
in here and push me around.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.815
Act tough. Demand answers.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.019
I keep barking
until I get answers.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.857
You are not going
to change anything.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.039
(faint screech)

18:16.972 --> 18:18.587
Are you a succubus?

18:22.060 --> 18:26.724
Tell me what do the
Dark Fae devour these days?

18:26.940 --> 18:31.855
I wouldn't know.
I'm unaligned.

18:33.405 --> 18:34.941
That's impossible.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.490
Impossible? Like a magical
train that travels through other

18:39.703 --> 18:42.740
dimensions and kills you
when you try to leave it?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.542
I really wish
there was sauce...

18:46.751 --> 18:48.412
What kind of Fae are you?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.244
Huh? Some memory wiper?

18:57.053 --> 19:00.420
Memory is not my power.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.880
What is it then?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.142
My curse.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.515
What curse?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.808
We all have our burdens.

19:13.028 --> 19:17.692
True. But yours happens to
be a pain in my ass, Wanderer.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.898
Rainer.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.781
Please, call me Rainer.

19:29.461 --> 19:35.127
Whoever you are? I'll
be taking my dinner to go.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.978
Approaching Tad for
Efficiency Evaluation.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.024
|nte| imminent because,
yes, I am that good.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.772
Hi, I'm Lorna Larson
from KLD Consulting.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.821
Here to evaluate the
efficiency of your position.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.695
Why don't we uh, take a walk.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.746
Or a roll, or we
can just hang out. Here.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.789
I'm the most efficient
person at Alaria.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.744
And in the spirit of efficiency,
let's make this quick.

20:13.963 --> 20:17.581
Right. Does your disability
ever affect your work?

20:17.801 --> 20:19.587
Does your leave-in
shampoo seep into your scalp

20:19.803 --> 20:20.838
and affect yours?

20:21.054 --> 20:21.759
Zing-a-ling-a-ding-dong!

20:21.971 --> 20:25.213
You're not an assistant,
you're a SASS-istant.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.139
It's in the job description.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.933
So uh, what happened to
your legs? Or lack thereof.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.231
Do you have ten
seconds and a violin?

20:35.443 --> 20:36.558
Yeah!

20:39.030 --> 20:39.985
Fourth year college.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.109
I got sick with peripheral
arterial disease.

20:42.325 --> 20:43.735
It was either amputate or die.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.614
Piling medical bills,
laid off parents. Fun.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.789
Then... Darren came along.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.367
Covered our expenses.
Gave me a job.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.248
He saved my life.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.593
And now it's my
mission to protect him.

21:03.805 --> 21:09.266
Make sure nothing, or no
one, ever gets in his way.

21:09.477 --> 21:14.016
So if he, um, ever
did anything, un-kosher,

21:14.232 --> 21:17.315
would you cover for him?

21:17.527 --> 21:19.108
Darren's a genius.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.153
People would
love to see him fall.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.856
I protect him
from the crazies.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.816
(phone vibrates)

21:27.996 --> 21:30.282
l have a meeting to attend.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.159
Because I'm
efficient that way.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.285
Right.

21:36.129 --> 21:40.042
Tad is not a mermaid.
Repeat, not a mermaid.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.749
DYSON: Well he sure got
defensive about Darren Clare.

21:46.681 --> 21:48.091
Oh, hello.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.014
LAUREN: Those files you
stole-- These dismemberments

21:50.226 --> 21:53.093
were executed with
surgical precision.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.599
Not like the pool hack
job that Diana suffered?

21:55.815 --> 21:56.930
Do you see a match?

21:57.150 --> 21:58.435
All of these belonged to men.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.187
But why the sudden
interest in women's parts?

22:00.403 --> 22:02.439
Kenzi. If you could
get me a sample or a--

22:02.655 --> 22:04.111
Got it. I'm going back in.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.610
And maybe this
time I'll see a mermaid.

22:08.828 --> 22:19.420
(playing piano)

22:19.631 --> 22:22.293
By all means, let yourself in.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.249
Who needs privacy?

22:27.472 --> 22:28.382
Oh.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.590
At least play
something more cheerful.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.234
Final Countdown? Really?

22:45.823 --> 22:47.074
You play Risk?

22:52.288 --> 22:55.121
I lost a long time ago.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.665
Something tells me you're
not talking about a game.

22:59.629 --> 23:00.835
No.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.420
You asked me
what my power was.

23:09.639 --> 23:14.133
| used to have
foresight. |n battle.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.843
l was able to see my opponent's
attacks before they happened.

23:20.608 --> 23:24.692
I put it to good use,
fought to end Light and Dark.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.610
How would you do that?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.606
l have seen good people
slaughtered in the name

23:30.827 --> 23:33.284
of what is supposedly "right".

23:33.496 --> 23:37.865
Families torn apart,
forced to choose a side.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.292
Fighting against each other
instead of with one another.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.711
A tyrannical rule
was on the rise.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.503
Whose rule?

23:54.142 --> 23:54.801
(slams keys)

23:55.018 --> 23:56.428
(clunk)

23:56.644 --> 24:00.603
I can't re--

24:00.815 --> 24:02.521
I can't.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.403
I'm sorry.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.111
Not being able to
remember why I'm here.

24:16.331 --> 24:17.821
Who cursed me.
Who took my power.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.326
What this is all for.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.657
lt-lt's...

24:26.633 --> 24:28.373
|t's torture.

24:29.927 --> 24:34.261
One can learn to live with,
or without, almost anything.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.924
That's not living.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.396
ANNOUNCER: Next stop,
same as the last.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.850
Last stop, same before next.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.860
Come on keypad, work with me.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.118
Someone's approaching but
their heat signature's blue.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.787
What does that mean?

24:59.999 --> 25:02.285
Colours correspond
to temperature.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.288
Well this one's cool.
Cool as a cucumber.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.041
Or cold as a fish,
Kenzi get out.

25:12.887 --> 25:19.258
(coughing, choking)

25:19.477 --> 25:21.092
Climbing the corporate
ladder is one thing.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.930
But crawling through the
corporate vent is a dead end.

25:34.742 --> 25:39.486
(gasping, coughing)

25:39.706 --> 25:45.076
So, not only are you stealing my
legs, you're stealing my mail?

25:45.294 --> 25:46.704
Where'd you get these letters?

25:46.921 --> 25:50.254
Merman? I gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.331
Where did you get these?

25:54.846 --> 25:56.052
Your assistant.

25:56.264 --> 25:59.051
Tad never gave them to me.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.349
He must have thought
she was a stalker.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.175
Who?

26:02.395 --> 26:03.760
My sister.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.100
There's over a
dozen pearls here.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.695
Do you know what this means?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.735
She loves
buck-a-shuck Tuesdays?

26:13.948 --> 26:15.358
She's gonna kill me.

26:15.575 --> 26:20.194
Well maybe you deserve it
for stealing Diana's legs.

26:20.413 --> 26:24.372
Diana lost her legs? I heard
she took a leave of absence.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.199
Are you saying
your sister did it?

26:26.419 --> 26:27.829
Pretty sure.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.208
But she doesn't know
how to attach them.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.539
Where'd you get yours?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.841
When Tad got sick,
he became my first donor.

26:35.052 --> 26:39.216
My team developed a tissue
fusion system using stem cells.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.890
Look, I'm not safe here.
Dominique is close.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.888
Please help me.
Take me to Diana.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.139
How can I trust you?

26:46.355 --> 26:48.812
lam standing in a
room full of man gams.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.981
Did you sign your donor card?

26:53.362 --> 26:57.230
They were all willing.
I didn't hurt anyone.

26:57.450 --> 27:00.533
My entire life, I wanted
to be a part of a world

27:00.745 --> 27:02.531
I didn't belong to.

27:03.581 --> 27:05.822
This is my only way.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.203
You wanna be where
the people are.

27:08.419 --> 27:09.579
(clunk)

27:18.012 --> 27:19.297
(gaSPS)

27:21.140 --> 27:24.132
Tahiti Sunset. Diana's legs.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.388
She's closer than
I thought. I'm dead.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.390
No, I can get you out of here.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.437
She'll be looking
for more legs, won't she?

27:30.650 --> 27:32.936
Yeah. She can hide in
the pool water system.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.564
You're gonna have
to fish her out.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.896
I know the best bait in town.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.867
Just act natural.
Go for a swim.

27:47.083 --> 27:47.742
You go for a swim.

28:33.588 --> 28:34.373
Now!

28:34.589 --> 28:36.580
(beeping)

28:48.644 --> 28:53.559
Two minute warning.
Next station in two minutes.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.381
What did you do?

30:06.806 --> 30:09.718
When I was seven, l...

30:15.106 --> 30:18.598
It is. You.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.410
You're going
to miss your stop.

30:31.622 --> 30:35.956
But this. Us.

30:37.253 --> 30:40.290
Go. While you still can.

30:40.506 --> 30:41.006
No.

30:41.215 --> 30:44.252
Go. Go!

30:46.804 --> 30:48.669
AAAHHHHGGGGGHH!

31:04.238 --> 31:05.648
(door clicks)

31:23.049 --> 31:24.505
What am I doing?

31:32.433 --> 31:34.924
Didn't like that underwater
frequency, did ya?

31:38.981 --> 31:41.267
God. She's beautiful.

31:41.484 --> 31:42.394
Legs!

31:42.610 --> 31:43.975
Yes, that's
what they're called.

31:44.195 --> 31:45.059
Legs!

31:45.279 --> 31:46.143
Not yours.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.614
Lauren's. There's
a difference.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.075
God damn mermaids. I should
just end her now, right?

31:50.284 --> 31:51.364
You feel like some sushi?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.863
No! I need to walk.

31:54.080 --> 31:54.910
Legs.

31:55.122 --> 31:57.499
You are hurting
people. It's wrong.

31:57.708 --> 32:00.950
I didn't. I need them
to get to my brother.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.536
He abandoned me when he
left home for his "Walking".

32:03.756 --> 32:04.541
What's that?

32:04.757 --> 32:06.463
Like a Rumspringa?

32:06.675 --> 32:09.212
When the Amish community
leave their home for a while

32:09.428 --> 32:11.293
to explore the world,
and then they decide whether

32:11.514 --> 32:14.256
or not to come back,
live a traditional life.

32:14.475 --> 32:17.057
We get magic legs for
a year to walk the earth.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.976
I had my time. Came
home like a good girl.

32:20.189 --> 32:23.522
But Darren somehow made
his Walking permanent.

32:23.734 --> 32:27.568
And you thought you'd follow
suit, only without the means.

32:29.532 --> 32:33.241
Do you have any idea what
it feels like to be ignored?

32:33.452 --> 32:37.115
To be locked out by
someone that you love?

32:49.718 --> 32:53.210
I've been sending
these pearls to Darren.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.557
That's my eighteenth.
It means l've suffered enough

32:55.766 --> 32:57.097
to take someone's life.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.016
So you're here to
kill your own brother?

33:00.229 --> 33:02.311
I would never.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.059
My sister on the other hand.

33:04.275 --> 33:06.561
She promised to get
Darren and come back.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.234
I waited and waited.

33:09.446 --> 33:13.610
For years.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.488
She lied to me.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.992
So I took her
human walking sticks.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.743
Your sister?

33:27.256 --> 33:29.668
So it wasn't you.

33:29.884 --> 33:32.421
Thought you were trying
to cut me out of my position.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.046
By cutting off your legs?

33:34.263 --> 33:36.049
Isn't that what mermen do?

33:36.265 --> 33:38.381
I hope you guys like tuna!

33:38.601 --> 33:40.011
(high pitched sonic noises)

33:40.227 --> 33:41.467
Ocean speak!

33:41.687 --> 33:44.895
You've gotta teach
me some epic mer-swears?

33:45.107 --> 33:46.722
Here.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.228
Oi vay! Do you need a
pashmina? You're freezing cold!

33:49.445 --> 33:52.937
Cold as a... fish?

33:53.157 --> 33:55.864
You're not pixie,
you're a mermaid.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.115
And you're my new bottom half.

34:06.712 --> 34:07.918
I don't get it.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.496
Why would you hire us if you
thought your own brother did it?

34:10.716 --> 34:11.626
I thought he was
trying to get rid of me.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.458
So, I hired you to play
detective to get rid of him.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.009
God, for a species
without assholes,

34:16.222 --> 34:17.883
you sure act like ones.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.881
Drop the knife.

34:21.518 --> 34:24.385
Take one more
step and she's chum.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.478
Dominique,
Dominique, Dominique.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.602
Always screwing everything up.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.479
I want you both to come home.

34:31.695 --> 34:32.855
She's our sloppy sister.

34:33.072 --> 34:33.686
(g rowls)

34:33.906 --> 34:34.861
Aigt!

34:35.074 --> 34:39.192
(choking)

34:39.411 --> 34:40.196
Dyson .

34:40.412 --> 34:41.822
Dominique, you
are so small pond.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.870
Darren and I worked
hard for our legs!

34:44.083 --> 34:45.744
Let's just all go back home.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.703
You promised me that
you would come back...

34:49.922 --> 34:52.038
You forgot about me.

34:53.676 --> 34:54.506
Dominique.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.049
You stay here with us.

34:56.262 --> 34:56.967
It's perfect--

34:57.179 --> 34:58.134
You get the doctor's.

34:58.347 --> 34:59.427
Diana gets the squirmy one's.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.881
And I upgrade to wolf legs.

35:03.018 --> 35:03.552
Dominique, don't listen.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.134
You have to help us.

35:05.354 --> 35:06.184
No.

35:06.397 --> 35:07.512
I like his idea!

35:07.731 --> 35:10.143
(groans)

35:10.359 --> 35:12.441
Stop it, you're killing him!

35:12.653 --> 35:13.768
Look at that.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.603
Teamwork.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.024
The family's back together!

35:20.244 --> 35:21.029
We'll get our legs.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.701
Blow up Alaria Tech.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.744
Start over again in Maui.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.039
Now is the time
for our kind to rise.

35:27.251 --> 35:28.206
Goodbye sea shells.

35:28.419 --> 35:31.206
Hello Victoria's Secret!

35:31.422 --> 35:33.378
There's nothing
that can stop us.

35:34.842 --> 35:37.709
Except tap water.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.752
Oh shit.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.976
And you missed the last stop.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.314
And the one before that.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.265
And the one before that.
And the one before that...

35:52.484 --> 35:55.601
Time is different
in this place.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.192
Are my friends still safe?

36:02.411 --> 36:05.995
Kenzi and Dyson are coming
close to finding the compass.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.787
When they break it,
they'll remember you.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.865
And you won't remember me.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.005
It was worth it.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.876
Even if I never see you again.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.208
After all, it is my curse.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.339
Screw your curse.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.796
Everything's ready.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.881
Nobody's ever come back...

36:27.936 --> 36:29.187
Tell me again.

36:29.396 --> 36:32.354
(laughs)

36:37.279 --> 36:38.860
All the clues are in place.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.029
When I return home.

36:41.241 --> 36:44.404
They'll guide me back to you,
even though I won't remember.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.451
When your crows brought
us that gorgeous singer

36:46.663 --> 36:50.326
to perform for us, I told
her to come find me...

36:50.542 --> 36:52.203
Who? Who told you to come?

36:52.419 --> 36:53.625
You did.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.168
And then there's Hugin.

36:55.381 --> 36:58.418
When I open that jar,
he will guide me back...

36:58.634 --> 37:00.420
And if that is not enough,

37:00.636 --> 37:04.879
there is one thing that
I know for sure will work...

37:12.231 --> 37:14.062
A contract with the Dark.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.941
Be my witness?

37:19.405 --> 37:20.895
No.

37:21.115 --> 37:23.197
|t betrays who you are.
Everything I fought for.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.946
This is never gonna stick.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.493
If there is one
thing that I know

37:28.705 --> 37:31.162
I would never in a
million years align myself.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.912
If I go home, and
find out that I am Dark

37:34.128 --> 37:36.961
I will move heaven and earth
to figure out how that happened.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.548
Bringing me back to you.

37:41.760 --> 37:46.129
When I return, I will
destroy this contract.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.213
Save you from this train.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.971
I will get you
everything back.

37:51.186 --> 37:52.847
Your memory.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.849
Your power.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.230
What if I'm a monster?

38:05.451 --> 38:06.816
What then?

38:10.747 --> 38:12.999
Then I'll kill you myself.

38:13.750 --> 38:18.289
(trembles)

38:18.505 --> 38:22.373
For now, all you have to do
is keep this train running.

38:22.593 --> 38:25.005
Okay?

38:25.220 --> 38:27.131
Stay alive.

38:42.571 --> 38:46.359
Unanimes venit lumen.

38:46.575 --> 38:50.409
Unanimes veniat pax.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.203
Malum est--

38:53.415 --> 38:55.326
Oh good, you're all here.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.531
Being creepy.

38:56.752 --> 38:59.539
You have broken our
laws again, Succubus.

38:59.755 --> 39:02.371
The Wanderer is not intended
for this physical plane.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.081
It is his curse.

39:04.301 --> 39:06.963
Breaking curses
is kind of my thing.

39:07.179 --> 39:09.044
Rainer, now!

39:21.068 --> 39:24.026
I can feel it.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.694
I can see their attacks.

39:25.906 --> 39:28.488
My power of foresight is
back, Bo and we're in danger.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.611
This is the reason
you were cursed.

39:30.827 --> 39:33.910
This is too much
power for a rebel.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.113
Your corrupt council
warrants a rebellion.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.496
What you speak is blasphemy.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.874
For your crime, we will
kill your claimed human.

39:43.090 --> 39:44.079
The doctor.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.004
The wolf.

39:45.217 --> 39:45.967
The siren.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.712
Everyone you love will perish.

39:47.928 --> 39:52.718
After you have witnessed their
destruction, we will kill you.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.925
Capture the Succubus
and The Warrior.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.728
Seek out her
friends, her families.

39:59.940 --> 40:03.023
We will make her
watch as they suffer.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.645
(fighting sounds and grunts)

40:04.861 --> 40:06.362
I don't want what comes next.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.857
You don't want
what comes next.

40:08.073 --> 40:11.531
You know you can't
defeat us, Succubus.

40:11.743 --> 40:12.858
She's right.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.239
Last time | succubused
them, it almost killed me.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.707
They'll reflect my attacks
because it uses my power.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.201
The Keeper is
quick as lightning.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.204
But you can do
this with my help.

40:21.420 --> 40:21.954
How?

40:22.170 --> 40:22.875
Duck.

40:23.088 --> 40:23.372
What?

40:23.589 --> 40:24.328
Duck!

40:24.548 --> 40:28.712
(fighting sounds and grunts)

40:28.927 --> 40:30.428
Block!

40:34.975 --> 40:35.885
Kick!

40:38.604 --> 40:42.142
(panting)

40:42.357 --> 40:43.392
Holy shit.

40:43.609 --> 40:44.724
It's working.

40:44.943 --> 40:45.523
What next?

40:45.736 --> 40:47.351
Do you trust me?

40:50.991 --> 40:52.822
Once we get rid
of this sea foam,

40:53.035 --> 40:54.946
it's unlikely they'll
survive the sewage system.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.699
How'd you know it
would kill them anyway?

40:57.914 --> 41:00.496
I noticed tap water
killed the aquatic plant.

41:00.709 --> 41:02.370
Diana refusing to
drink a drop combined

41:02.586 --> 41:04.702
with the composition
of Dominique's pearl.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.707
Salt water pool.

41:06.923 --> 41:07.912
The rest was osmosis!

41:08.133 --> 41:09.043
Huh!

41:09.259 --> 41:10.044
Smarty pants.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.216
You know what?

41:12.429 --> 41:13.919
We make an excellent team.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.424
We do.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.715
Bo never called.

41:17.934 --> 41:18.593
Kenzi.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.552
No, |'m-- I'm
worried about her...

41:21.772 --> 41:24.889
I mean--

41:25.108 --> 41:27.440
What are they even doing?!

41:39.331 --> 41:40.036
Bo...

41:40.248 --> 41:49.464
(panting)

41:55.389 --> 41:57.380
What's next?

41:58.934 --> 42:00.014
You got this.

42:00.227 --> 42:02.343
Succubus.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.224
If you do this,
if you follow him--

42:05.440 --> 42:10.525
you will suffer a fate
beyond your worst nightmares.

42:10.737 --> 42:15.447
A fate even worse than
your own whore of a mother's!

42:15.659 --> 42:18.742
You will be dragged
beneath lrkalla,

42:18.954 --> 42:22.196
damned like the spawn
of evil that you are!

42:22.416 --> 42:24.623
No more threats.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.700
No more councils.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.250
Eugh!

42:31.466 --> 42:33.252
Bitch.

42:42.936 --> 42:44.346
Bo...

42:46.148 --> 42:48.059
What are you doing here?

42:48.275 --> 42:49.355
Leave.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.149
This can't wait.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.568
How dare you
come into my home.

42:53.780 --> 42:56.021
lnto my room.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.859
Rainer will ask you
to slay the Una Mens.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.409
I know that
they've wronged us.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.282
That they're evil.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.079
But I am begging you...

43:05.292 --> 43:08.534
Don't do it.

43:08.754 --> 43:12.167
Their power will be amassed
into a single remaining seed.

43:12.382 --> 43:13.246
What seed?

43:13.467 --> 43:15.583
The Origin Seed.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.793
It was stolen from me.

43:18.013 --> 43:20.299
In the wrong hands...

43:20.515 --> 43:21.925
What, Trick?

43:22.142 --> 43:23.803
Just give me your word.

43:24.019 --> 43:24.883
That's all | ask.
