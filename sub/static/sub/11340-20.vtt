00:07.120 --> 00:08.781
Previously on Criminal Minds.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.166
Is my baby girl on that beach?

00:10.170 --> 00:12.991
One of the victims that we found
fits Cindi's general description.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.070
Morgan's cousin fled a stalker.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.958
So whenever_ unidentified
female remains turn up...

00:17.960 --> 00:19.245
He gets that call.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.878
I know you, Derek.
There is something, isn't there?

00:21.880 --> 00:25.168
My aunt has spent years
obsessing over Cindi's last few hours.

00:25.170 --> 00:26.285
It's killing her, Rossi.

00:26.290 --> 00:28.030
I'm never gonna know, am I?

00:28.040 --> 00:29.371
He picked out her picture.

00:29.380 --> 00:30.495
She's dead.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.788
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

00:45.080 --> 00:47.071
Hi.
Leave a message after the tone.

00:48.250 --> 00:53.665
Hey, Mom, it's me. They're all out
of the 2%, so I got 1% instead.

00:53.670 --> 00:57.618
Um, let me know if an extra 1%
makes that much of a difference

00:57.620 --> 01:00.953
and I'll stop at Jewel or something.
All right. Bye.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.822
What? Hey! Hey!

01:20.830 --> 01:22.036
Cindi?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.417
Oh, my God.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.746
Somebody call 911. Hurry!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.035
Hey.

02:07.620 --> 02:08.826
Everything all right?

02:08.830 --> 02:11.458
Derek, you need to come home.

02:11.710 --> 02:12.825
What's wrong

02:13.170 --> 02:14.410
It's Desiree.

02:16.880 --> 02:17.995
She's been hurt.

02:29.040 --> 02:32.749
Either my big brother's in the room,
or somebody else

02:32.750 --> 02:36.038
is wearing his nasty-ass cologne.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.705
Well, hey, there.

02:44.710 --> 02:45.995
Where's Mom?

02:46.290 --> 02:49.453
I sent her home.
I wanted her to get some rest.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.160
Desi?

02:54.580 --> 02:55.706
What were you thinking?

02:55.710 --> 02:59.328
-Who were you chasing?
-I didn't see the driver.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.877
-But the passenger...
-Yeah?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.036
It was Cindi.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.826
-Aunt Yvonne's Cindi?
-Yes.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.240
Desi...

03:14.580 --> 03:16.241
-She's_dead.

03:16.620 --> 03:18.030
I swear to God,

03:18.040 --> 03:21.749
she was as close as you are to me.
Closer.

03:22.960 --> 03:27.579
You gotta listen to me.
Sometimes our mind plays tricks on us.

03:28.620 --> 03:32.613
We invent things. It's why
eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

03:32.620 --> 03:36.249
No. When I got her to look at me,

03:36.250 --> 03:38.286
she didn't just recognize me,

03:39.250 --> 03:40.911
she said something.

03:42.330 --> 03:44.571
She said, "I'm sorry."

03:47.040 --> 03:48.701
Now, would I invent that?

03:51.580 --> 03:52.740
It was her.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.918
-How's your sister?
-She's awake. She's talking.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.457
Good. Morgan, take as much
personal time as you need.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.739
Hotch...

04:15.380 --> 04:18.577
-I think I might have a case out here.
-What do you mean?

04:19.580 --> 04:22.959
Look, I need to come clean
about something.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.531
I lied about someone being dead.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.246
I'm sorry?

04:27.580 --> 04:30.287
Last year, that fisherman UnSub
that was dumping the bodies

04:30.290 --> 04:34.249
in the Atlantic, he claimed that
my cousin was one of his victims.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.036
Falsely.
You deduced he'd never met her.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.115
I told my family it was him.

04:41.830 --> 04:45.539
Cindi had been missing for eight years
and my aunt needed closure.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.372
And even though I kept looking,
I lied, Hotch.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.952
I lied because I wanted
my family to move on.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.161
But now there's evidence she's alive.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.076
-You still there?
-We're on our way.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.701
What did you do?

06:10.080 --> 06:11.616
"Worse than telling a lie

06:11.620 --> 06:15.909
"is spending your whole life
staying true to a lie." Robert Brault.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.411
So your cousin fled Chicago
eight years ago

06:18.420 --> 06:20.320
because a co-worker was stalking her?

06:20.960 --> 06:22.916
Yeah, a guy named John Hitchens.

06:23.540 --> 06:26.282
Cindi and Yvonne came to me
and asked me if they should be worried.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.537
Her e-mails and phone logs
showed classic stalker behavior.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.998
Multiple messages every hour,
gifts he sent which she later returned.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.319
That would enrage a stalker.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.878
But until they become violent,
they're smart enough to skirt the law.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.957
_ Human resources at _
the Investment bank wouldn't do anything,

06:40.960 --> 06:42.780
and Chicago PD. couldn't.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.742
So Yvonne and I convinced Cindi to move.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.538
She contacted us from Charleston
on her way to Savannah.

06:49.540 --> 06:50.575
And then she was gone.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.168
And Hitchens blew his brains out
two weeks later in Chicago.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.663
That was good enough for the local P.D.
to conclude that he'd killed her.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.577
Except for one major detail.
We never found the body.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.575
If his endgame was suicide,

07:02.580 --> 07:05.037
he wasn't organized enough to
dispose of the body that permanently.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.917
That's why I never stopped looking.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.747
I just didn't think that she would
surface right back here in Chicago.

07:10.170 --> 07:11.785
We need to reopen both cases.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.781
Both Cindi's disappearance
and Hitchens' suicide.

07:13.790 --> 07:16.247
The discrepancies in each
would explain her current behavior.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.115
Morgan, I need to talk
to you when we land.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.780
I can't wait.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.788
Your older sister called me
about the accident.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.110
She also told me what Desiree saw.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.610
Look, Auntie, we don't know
anything for sure yet.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.248
Derek Morgan,
what is going on with my daughter?

07:40.620 --> 07:41.666
Please.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.785
Detective Palmer,
what do you have?

08:07.790 --> 08:09.610
I wish we had more to give you.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.826
_ _ You know how
mIssmg persons cases are.

08:11.830 --> 08:13.070
Actually, there's quite a bit here.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.036
These were found
in Hitchens' apartment after the suicide.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.577
Some were blown up
from the original film stock.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.492
So if Hitchens took them,
he didn't zoom in on Photoshop.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.320
He's an old-school shutterbug.

08:22.330 --> 08:25.379
Reid and Prentiss, check
Hitchens' photographic background.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.496
Even eight years ago,
most people had gone digital.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.992
The gun Hitchens used to kill himself
was traced to this dealer.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.412
A local guy,
completely by the book, no record.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.207
The .44 was the only gun
in Hitchens' possession.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.030
That's a big gun to kill yourself with.

08:38.460 --> 08:39.666
We should talk to the dealer,

08:39.670 --> 08:41.319
find out what his mindset was
when he bought it.

08:53.540 --> 08:56.452
Hey.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.958
Um, I sent you the case file
Chicago PD. sent me.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.205
I got it.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.917
Yeah. So there's that.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.412
-Baduhuh?

09:11.380 --> 09:13.200
Yeah. It's pretty bad.

09:16.710 --> 09:18.029
Penelope, can you just talk to me?

09:18.830 --> 09:19.876
Uh-huh.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.371
Yeah, what about?

09:21.710 --> 09:24.076
I don't care, just... Just talk.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.871
Okay, um...

09:30.460 --> 09:31.495
Um...

09:32.210 --> 09:33.325
What?

09:33.330 --> 09:38.165
I... This is the first time in my life
I don't have anything to say,

09:38.170 --> 09:40.411
except that I'm here for you.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.916
Okay, Derek? I'm right here.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.741
Yeah, I know you are.

09:47.460 --> 09:50.247
-The gun was bought eight years ago?
-At least, if not longer.

09:53.790 --> 09:54.825
Here we go.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.570
Oh, yeah.

10:01.290 --> 10:02.416
There he is.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.070
-John Hitchens

10:06.080 --> 10:08.913
No, ma'am. The fellow who bought
this piece was Malcolm Ford.

10:13.790 --> 10:14.825
Huh.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.876
Excuse me.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.202
Well, maybe the gun traded hands.
Malcolm Ford sold it to Hitchens,

10:21.210 --> 10:22.950
and Hitchens shot himself?

10:22.960 --> 10:24.700
Or he never sold it to Hitchens at all.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.240
He used it on him.

10:27.210 --> 10:31.453
So I guess the real question here is
who's Malcolm Ford?

10:33.330 --> 10:35.707
-We're leaving.
-Ready.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.610
Wait. Put this in the glove box.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.206
-Cindi!
-Hey.

10:58.540 --> 10:59.871
Getting away for the weekend?

10:59.880 --> 11:01.324
Just headed up to the cabin.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.457
-Ah. Have fun.
-Will do.

11:14.380 --> 11:17.031
Malcolm, do we have to do this?
Maybe she didn't recognize me.

11:17.040 --> 11:21.113
Maybe. But we can't take that chance.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.535
So Cindi had two stalkers.

11:31.080 --> 11:34.823
No, only one. Ford fits the profile
better than Hitchens.

11:34.830 --> 11:36.912
Ford had multiple assault
and harassment charges,

11:36.920 --> 11:39.707
all filed by ex-girlfriends
and random women he met.

11:40.170 --> 11:41.785
And Garcia found credit card purchases

11:41.790 --> 11:43.872
for black-and-white photographic
equipment for Ford.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.450
So this guy killed
Hitchens and then set him up.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.577
Behaviorally it would make sense.
If Ford was stalking your cousin,

11:49.580 --> 11:51.616
he would have seen Hitchens
as competition,

11:51.620 --> 11:55.204
so he kills him and he plants the photos
to throw off your investigation.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.911
Hotch, I want to bring
this guy in and question him personally.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.326
Garcia just sent us his address.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.245
Morgan.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.747
Have you told your aunt
about any of this?

12:11.170 --> 12:12.319
She, uh...

12:13.460 --> 12:14.779
Yeah.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.917
We need to know how Ford found Cindi.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.666
So you need to ask her.

12:21.330 --> 12:22.376
Is that it?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.069
That's it.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.707
FBI!

12:36.540 --> 12:37.916
It's clear here.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.990
Clear.
REID: Clear.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.115
Guys.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.327
The house is empty, but there's
evidence of a woman living here.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.537
Looks like
they both packed up in a hurry.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.160
They're trying to cover their tracks.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.745
What the hell is she doing
with this guy?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.279
Hello, you two.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.160
You must be Cindi.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.610
Dominic has told me
so much about you.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.281
This is Dominic and his wife Suzy.
They're gonna help us out.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.878
Cindi? You have permission.

13:38.710 --> 13:41.747
Thank you for all your help.
Please let me know if I can be of service.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.955
Impressive.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.707
-Can we hide the car?
-Yeah. There's room in the garage.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.707
And I've been in touch with a guy
who can get you into Canada.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.616
We're not going to the cabin?

14:00.290 --> 14:01.780
Why don't I take you inside?

14:05.750 --> 14:07.286
Right this way.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.741
Let me give you the tour.

14:18.620 --> 14:19.917
How long you been married?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.035
Twelve years.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.496
Want to know the secret?

14:24.920 --> 14:25.955
Communication.

14:26.620 --> 14:29.418
He talks, I listen.
Down here, sweetheart.

14:32.460 --> 14:34.872
This is my room. You can take the bed.

15:02.790 --> 15:04.701
I wouldn't do that.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.372
-What is it?
-It's a head box.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.872
He would take my cousin's head

15:14.880 --> 15:17.781
and put it through the hole,
and then he'd...

15:24.540 --> 15:25.825
Morgan, we need to deliver a profile.

15:25.830 --> 15:28.572
Why, Reid?
We know who the UnSub is.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.666
We need to deliver the profile.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.872
I've had lots of servants
but none like her.

15:39.620 --> 15:40.666
How'd you do it?

15:41.170 --> 15:43.991
Told her about the Company and what
they'd do to her if she didn't behave.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.740
Oh.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.662
There's one number
programmed on here.

15:50.670 --> 15:52.820
He'll get you to Toronto tonight.

15:52.830 --> 15:53.990
He a Company man?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.661
You can trust him.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.785
Auntie...

16:01.500 --> 16:03.115
Do you know that man?

16:04.460 --> 16:05.495
Yes.

16:07.170 --> 16:08.910
He went to the church
Cindi and I went to.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.166
Did you talk to him?

16:13.250 --> 16:14.376
He talked to us.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.615
Is this him?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.035
Yes.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.877
Most stalkers have the delusion that

16:23.880 --> 16:26.917
the woman that they're after wants to
be with them, but not this man.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.201
He lays low and he follows you.

16:31.710 --> 16:33.530
He watched us pack up Cindi.

16:34.540 --> 16:37.031
And then he kept watching her
all the way to Charleston.

16:38.710 --> 16:41.998
But if he brought her back here,
why didn't she try to escape?

16:43.210 --> 16:46.873
After eight years in captivity
at the hands of Malcolm Ford,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.747
we believe Cindi Burns' ego
has been shattered.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.878
As a result, he could afford to give
her some degree of freedom

16:52.880 --> 16:54.871
and trust that she would stay with him.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.530
Which is why it's going to be
very difficult

16:56.540 --> 16:58.326
to get Cindi away from her captor.

16:58.330 --> 17:00.912
We believe she's suffering an extreme
form of Stockholm syndrome.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.115
Like that girl from the '70s, Hearst.

17:03.460 --> 17:04.779
Patty Hearst, that's right.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.746
So is Cindi gonna start
robbing banks now?

17:06.750 --> 17:09.378
No. He's done something a lot worse.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.706
He got her to believe in the Company.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.376
What's the Company?

17:15.380 --> 17:17.575
It's a sadomasochjstic
role-play scenario,

17:17.580 --> 17:20.037
a game, essentially, in which
a cabal of men tell their submissives

17:20.040 --> 17:21.917
they can trade their slaves at their whim.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.741
If you displease your master
or try to escape,

17:24.750 --> 17:28.288
the Company will find you,
kill you, and kill your family.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.208
The voluntary submissives
understand that it's just a fantasy,

17:31.210 --> 17:33.576
but Malcolm Ford has gotten Cindi
to believe that it's real.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.115
How?

17:35.120 --> 17:38.328
This was dated
three years after her abduction.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.070
Which means for the last five years,

17:40.080 --> 17:42.742
her only reality
was his unending abuse.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.825
Then he gave her this.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.452
This is a slave contract.

18:02.670 --> 18:04.376
She signed her name.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.950
My baby girl.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.877
The documentation
we've found on the Company

18:11.880 --> 18:14.701
informs our proﬁle
and will inform your manhunt,

18:14.710 --> 18:17.452
because it might point to
where Malcolm Ford is now.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.611
The language on their contract
speaks of an underground network,

18:20.620 --> 18:23.874
which tells us that
he has a few men he trusts.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.658
Which means that what started as
an S&M game could now be a ring.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.780
All right.

18:47.580 --> 18:49.377
He said this is where he'd pick us up.

18:52.170 --> 18:56.209
-Stop. Right now.
-Yes, sir.

19:00.170 --> 19:01.660
I think it's time for a lesson.

19:01.670 --> 19:04.377
- No! I'll behave, I promise.
-Mmm-mmm.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.951
Please, I'll behave, I promise.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.746
You had your chance.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.708
I want you to get that damn cabin
out of your mind, okay?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.326
'Cause we're not coming back.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.116
-Is that clear?
- Clear.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.701
-Huh?
- Yes.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.911
Now go get me something to eat.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.240
Stop.

20:32.120 --> 20:36.284
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking you got nothing left.

20:36.290 --> 20:39.703
But that's not true. You got family.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.958
Malcolm, please, he's not a threat to us.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.575
But you are.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.281
And when you think
about your next step,

20:47.290 --> 20:48.996
I want you to think about this.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.031
I got eyes on him right now.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.617
One phone call from me
and he's dead in 30 seconds.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.417
Is that what you want?

20:59.620 --> 21:01.281
I thought not.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.451
-What's going on?

21:11.460 --> 21:14.418
You said you wanted dinner.
It was an accident.

21:14.420 --> 21:15.535
Sir, what's the problem?

21:15.540 --> 21:18.327
My wife forgot
to put this back.

21:18.330 --> 21:19.877
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to check your purse.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.700
No. It's just a misunderstanding.

21:22.540 --> 21:23.825
Ma'am, please come with me.

21:23.830 --> 21:26.958
Look, we're paying for it, okay?

21:26.960 --> 21:30.032
It's a misunderstanding
and we're leaving.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.741
I just thought
I was doing what you told me to do.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.663
Malcolm, please. I'm really sorry.
We can make it if we leave right now.

21:40.670 --> 21:42.535
We'll just go. We can leave right now.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.827
-Just...
-You're gonna pay for this.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.490
Garcia, did you get a hit?

21:54.500 --> 21:57.037
Yes. A 911 call at a grocery store

21:57.040 --> 21:59.372
identifying a couple matching
their description.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.996
Now, Hotch and the gang on their way,
but you guys are closer.

22:02.540 --> 22:04.531
-Take a left.
-I got It. Hang on.

22:09.670 --> 22:11.035
-There he is.
-I see him.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.322
Get out of the car and put
your hands where I can see them.

22:26.330 --> 22:29.618
Put your hands behind your
head and get on your knees.

22:31.580 --> 22:32.956
Is there a problem, sir?

22:38.120 --> 22:40.827
What do you got, Morgan?

22:40.830 --> 22:43.287
-Nothing.
-What do you mean, nothing?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.069
The car is empty.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.116
Morgan?

22:47.120 --> 22:49.281
Agent Derek Morgan?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.035
Well, well.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.201
-Where is she

22:54.290 --> 22:56.417
Where is she?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.319
Derek.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.326
Get up.

23:15.790 --> 23:16.996
Officer.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.376
Where are you going?

23:22.380 --> 23:23.665
I'm going to ride back
to the station with him.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.820
Oh, no, you're not. You're staying
here and processing the scene.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.286
-Rossi, come on!
-No.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.206
Yeah.

23:44.210 --> 23:45.416
Wow.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.877
Baby, I'm sorry. It's been a long night.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.826
Okay, Mr. Snappy.
I was just letting you know

23:51.830 --> 23:54.993
that I sent the grocery store
security camera footage to your tablet.

23:58.040 --> 23:59.610
You're welcome.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.996
Okay, out with it.
Where's your head at presently?

24:04.000 --> 24:06.707
Honestly, I'm trying to figure out
why I'm not back at that police station

24:06.710 --> 24:08.371
trying to break this son of a bitch.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.075
Oh!

24:10.920 --> 24:12.535
What are you doing

24:12.540 --> 24:15.168
For thinking that this is about you.

24:15.170 --> 24:17.536
Penelope, it is about me!
He called me out by name!

24:18.120 --> 24:19.371
Oh!

24:19.620 --> 24:21.076
Will you stop doing that?

24:22.040 --> 24:24.326
Seriously? Derek, seriously, in...

24:25.210 --> 24:27.030
You know, in the entire
time I have known you,

24:27.040 --> 24:29.702
you are like the glistening hero
in the movie of life.

24:29.710 --> 24:33.874
And now, just because some guy,
some ass-hat guy

24:33.880 --> 24:35.916
decides to call you out by name,

24:35.920 --> 24:38.070
you think you have
the right to get all weird

24:38.080 --> 24:40.241
and decide "this time it's personal"

24:40.250 --> 24:42.206
Derek, did you
ever stop to think that said ass-hat

24:42.210 --> 24:44.747
is exhibiting this behavior
just to get under your skin?

24:44.750 --> 24:46.240
As a matter of fact, I have.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.410
Okay, you know, well, a real hero

24:48.420 --> 24:51.537
would roll with that instead of
tripping over his gigantic ego.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.576
And as a wise black man once told me,

24:53.580 --> 24:55.616
"Baby girl, you be trippin'."
So I tell you what,

24:55.620 --> 24:57.076
why don't you call me back

24:57.080 --> 24:59.241
once you've gotten off
the self-absorption train

24:59.250 --> 25:01.115
and decide to be a real hero.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.917
The kind that Cindi is waiting for.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.319
-I am hanging up on you!

25:37.330 --> 25:39.457
-Hey, Detective.
-Yeah.

25:39.460 --> 25:40.825
Is this what my cousin stole?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.826
Well, according to the manager.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.036
Said it was an accident.

25:47.620 --> 25:48.780
No.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.609
No.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.491
She knew exactly what she was doing.

25:58.210 --> 25:59.609
How's it going?

25:59.620 --> 26:02.783
He hasn't asked for a lawyer yet.
He's baiting us.

26:02.790 --> 26:06.669
Which means we need an interrogation
strategy to throw him off.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.166
He's expecting Morgan.

26:11.960 --> 26:16.033
So then I get home and of course,
he's still up past his bedtime.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.918
Ugh! It reminds me why I'm not married.

26:19.170 --> 26:21.161
Well, neither am I, technically.

26:21.170 --> 26:23.206
Yeah, you're right.
That's true.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.070
-Do you guys ever...
-Oh...

26:25.080 --> 26:27.742
No, I really don't need a man
to tell me what to do.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.990
Yeah.

26:29.330 --> 26:30.786
-Excuse me.
- Shh.

26:31.460 --> 26:33.200
Uh, the adults are talking.

26:33.210 --> 26:37.112
When it's your turn to speak,
I'll give you permission. Okay?

26:37.460 --> 26:39.701
-So, anyway...
-Any sleep?

26:39.710 --> 26:41.780
-No. Of course not.
-Ugh!

26:42.830 --> 26:45.458
What are we doing here anyway? Um...

26:46.080 --> 26:48.662
Oh, okay. So yeah, Mal,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.616
you want to confess now
or just go straight to prison?

26:52.580 --> 26:55.822
Look, my wife and I
had a disagreement in that store, but...

26:55.830 --> 26:57.206
Whoa, wife?

26:57.210 --> 26:58.700
You're married?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.379
No. This is about John Hitchens.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.325
His suicide is looking
more like a murder,

27:05.330 --> 27:08.163
and the gun traces back to you.

27:11.210 --> 27:12.950
Okay. Let's go talk to this wife.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.666
He's not talking.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.535
I don't know who this
Hitchens person is,

27:16.540 --> 27:19.031
but if you had anything,
you'd have charged me already.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.450
You're here because of Cindi.

27:23.170 --> 27:24.285
Caught us.

27:24.290 --> 27:26.747
You know what?
This is my favorite part.

27:26.750 --> 27:28.957
This is where you hang yourself
with your own tongue.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.746
So please keep talking.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.741
What are you doing here?

27:33.750 --> 27:37.538
You got a baby at home being raised
by a man you're not married to.

27:37.540 --> 27:39.417
What are you doing here?

27:39.420 --> 27:42.992
Well, it's work. But we make it work.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.240
Where's Cindi?

27:44.540 --> 27:46.417
Work.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.035
I know all about work.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.247
Negotiating who does the dishes,

27:50.250 --> 27:53.413
fighting over who folds the laundry.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.911
Except Cindi and I never fight.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.456
She knows her role.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.701
After you beat her
into signing a contract.

28:01.710 --> 28:04.577
What we have is a bond
you know nothing about.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.160
But I'll tell you about it.

28:09.710 --> 28:11.780
If you ask permission.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.781
Come on.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.827
You're curious, aren't you?

28:24.830 --> 28:26.912
You want to know our secret.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.826
-Please let me go back in there.
-No.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.992
His guard is down.
He thinks he can manipulate me.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.458
We can't give him what he wants.
We need to keep him off balance.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.496
Then let me go in.

28:50.460 --> 28:53.281
-I can get in his head.
-The way he got into yours?

28:53.880 --> 28:57.828
Look, I know I have no right to ask this,
but please just trust me on this.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.707
I can break him.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.412
What time is it?

29:21.500 --> 29:22.990
You know what that is?

29:23.000 --> 29:24.911
My dinner.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.456
The time?

29:28.040 --> 29:31.168
When I was growing up,
my dad worked midnights.

29:31.420 --> 29:33.320
My mom worked pretty late, too.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.075
So me and my sisters had

29:35.080 --> 29:37.241
a lot of dinners
at Cindi and my aunt's house.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.320
It was kind of fun.

29:39.330 --> 29:42.322
Because you get to eat the stuff that
you don't always get to eat at home.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.701
Stuff like this.

29:44.710 --> 29:46.575
Same label, same everything.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.953
00, maybe 10:15.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.530
15.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.820
So when Cindi stole this,

29:55.080 --> 29:57.116
it was no accident, Malcolm.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.377
She was sending a message to me.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.416
A message?

30:01.420 --> 30:04.708
For eight years you beat her down
to where she could barely look up.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.031
But when my sister
saw her at that intersection,

30:07.040 --> 30:08.701
Cindi knew.

30:08.710 --> 30:10.246
She knew I would come for her.

30:10.250 --> 30:12.411
So she was letting me know
that she's still in there,

30:12.420 --> 30:14.536
that she's alive and she's waiting.

30:14.540 --> 30:15.746
She wouldn't do that.

30:15.750 --> 30:17.069
Oh, yes, she would.

30:17.710 --> 30:19.826
She had a whole store full of food
to choose from, Malcolm,

30:19.830 --> 30:20.956
and she chose that.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.286
She fought you for as long as she could,

30:23.290 --> 30:26.077
and now she's fighting you again
and you can't handle that, can you?

30:26.620 --> 30:28.110
What time is it?

30:28.830 --> 30:30.741
You know, it's funny

30:30.750 --> 30:33.571
that you keep mentioning the time.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.913
You had 20 minutes
from the store to your arrest.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.036
You knew we were coming.
Why didn't you run?

30:39.040 --> 30:41.076
You could have easily got away,
but you didn't.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.820
So something
must have slowed you down.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.280
Cindi slowed you down, didn't she?

30:46.080 --> 30:47.741
And you knew you couldn't be found

30:47.750 --> 30:49.661
with a crying, bleeding prisoner
in your car,

30:49.670 --> 30:51.069
so you kicked her to the curb.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.616
You wish it could be that easy.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.746
But it's not.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.536
Then explain it to me.

30:58.670 --> 31:00.285
What don't I know, Malcolm?

31:00.290 --> 31:03.111
You don't know what she became.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.247
You don't know the love she had for me.

31:06.580 --> 31:07.615
Had?

31:11.170 --> 31:13.161
You just said "had," past tense.

31:16.620 --> 31:19.578
You "have" a love if she's alive.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.280
You "had" one if she's dead.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.279
What did you do to her?

31:29.620 --> 31:30.780
Morgan.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.826
No. No, you didn't have enough time

31:32.830 --> 31:34.821
to dispose of the body properly.
We know that.

31:34.830 --> 31:37.071
-And we will find her!
-Morgan, out.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.662
And when we do, I will personally
nail your ass to the wall.

31:39.670 --> 31:41.376
That's what time it is, bitch!

31:43.120 --> 31:44.826
30 now?

31:45.290 --> 31:46.496
Bet it is!

31:46.830 --> 31:49.458
30.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.109
What was that for?

31:56.120 --> 31:57.951
I was in control. I wasn't gonna hurt him.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.030
Someone's retained a lavwer
on Malcolm's behalf.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.496
-He didn't invoke.
-I did.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.780
Cindi.

32:11.290 --> 32:12.530
Oh, my God.

32:12.540 --> 32:13.666
Stop.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.820
You're not to speak to her
or Malcolm Ford

32:15.830 --> 32:17.707
without me present.

32:17.710 --> 32:18.825
What the hell is this?

32:18.830 --> 32:21.037
You're holding my client
on suspicion of kidnapping.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.871
As you can see,

32:22.880 --> 32:24.780
the victim's alive and well.

32:24.790 --> 32:25.996
Kept against her will.

32:26.330 --> 32:27.456
No.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.496
He's my husband.
Now drop the charges.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.535
Cindi,

32:31.580 --> 32:32.990
why are you doing this?

32:35.330 --> 32:36.786
Because I love him.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.827
We've been clear
that we would like all charges dropped.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.162
We still have some questions
about John Hitchens.

32:48.170 --> 32:50.991
And Mr. Ford has explained
that the gun that Hitchens used

32:51.000 --> 32:54.663
to shoot himself was stolen.
He even filed a police report.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.168
So, what else do you need to know?

33:13.670 --> 33:16.116
We need a new plan. We can't hold him.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.076
There's one more thing.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.575
I can't talk to you.

33:44.580 --> 33:47.162
No, no. It's okay. I trust you.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.326
Baby”.

33:54.290 --> 33:55.325
Let me just...

33:55.830 --> 33:57.661
Let me just look at you.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.285
Oh!

34:09.460 --> 34:12.031
What has he done to you?

34:12.040 --> 34:14.110
He loves me.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.076
You call that love?

34:18.750 --> 34:20.957
I have to go. I have to make him dinner.

34:31.210 --> 34:33.326
That's not her.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.321
That is not my daughter.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.666
You did good.

35:03.670 --> 35:05.911
You mean it?

35:05.920 --> 35:07.876
Let's go to the cabin.

35:09.960 --> 35:13.373
We need to rethink the profile.
This ain't Stockholm.

35:13.380 --> 35:16.201
-It could be battered wife syndrome.
-No, it's not.

35:16.210 --> 35:18.280
Morgan, the way they hugged
each other,

35:18.290 --> 35:19.609
I think she genuinely loves him.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.248
I'm telling you, that's not the woman
I know. She wouldn't do that.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.918
Then what is it, Derek

35:26.880 --> 35:28.666
She said she needed
to cook dinner for him.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.992
Is that what you cook for your husband?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.876
Would you make that for Will?

35:34.880 --> 35:37.610
No. I might for Henry, though.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.871
Exactly.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.202
When I was growing up,
this is what Cindi and I ate.

35:41.210 --> 35:42.871
This exact brand.

35:43.290 --> 35:45.417
Hotch, what did your mom
make you for breakfast?

35:45.420 --> 35:47.035
Oatmeal and orange juice.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.782
-What do you make for Jack?
-Oatmeal and orange juice.

35:49.790 --> 35:53.169
-Same brand.
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

35:53.170 --> 35:56.242
She might have been cooking dinner,
but it was not for Malcolm Ford.

35:56.250 --> 35:59.208
-You think they have a child.
-Yes, I do.

35:59.210 --> 36:00.996
We didn't profile that.
There's no evidence of one

36:01.000 --> 36:02.115
in the home or in their lives.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.497
Unless Ford keeps the child
from her to keep her in line.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.990
I mean, that fits the profile.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.240
It's a stretch.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.411
It's the only theory
that would explain her behavior.

36:10.580 --> 36:11.615
All right, Morgan.

36:12.960 --> 36:13.995
Prove it.

36:22.540 --> 36:25.077
You want me to file
a harassment suit against the FBI?

36:25.080 --> 36:27.071
No, I don't.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.609
I just have a couple more questions
about the case.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.702
Actually, these are questions
that only you can answer.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.110
For the life of me, I couldn't figure out

36:40.120 --> 36:43.999
how a woman could be
held prisoner for over eight years

36:44.000 --> 36:45.786
and retain a lawyer so quickly.

36:47.210 --> 36:48.780
I mean, how could she do that,

36:49.620 --> 36:51.611
unless Malcolm told her where to go?

36:54.170 --> 36:57.037
Malcolm and I know each other. So?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.325
Except he needed a lawyer

36:58.330 --> 37:01.538
who understood the delicacy
of his situation, didn't he?

37:02.790 --> 37:04.166
So I did some digging.

37:06.710 --> 37:10.373
And I found out about
your mail-order bride from Russia.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.115
If I sat her down

37:17.120 --> 37:19.748
and I asked her about the Company,

37:19.750 --> 37:22.207
what do you think she would tell me?

37:24.170 --> 37:25.205
Okay, look.

37:25.670 --> 37:29.071
I'm a negotiator, so let's negotiate.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.661
Do you know
where they keep the children?

37:37.960 --> 37:38.995
Yeah.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.570
You better tell me where it is.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.871
You want us to wake up the boy?

37:56.170 --> 37:57.205
I'll do it.

38:13.330 --> 38:15.457
- Mama?
-Hi, baby.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.372
It's not Christmas.
What are you doing here?

38:18.380 --> 38:20.575
We're gonna go with Daddy
on a little trip, okay?

38:20.580 --> 38:21.956
Let's get your shoes.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.077
Come on. Move, move. Let's go.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.450
Go, go, go!

38:39.460 --> 38:40.779
Go inside.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.610
We are in position.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.571
Unit One has suspect in custody.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.200
Where's Malcolm Ford?

39:14.790 --> 39:18.612
Clear.
My God! How many do they have here?

39:27.170 --> 39:28.319
Secure the kids.

39:36.830 --> 39:38.161
Mommy!

39:42.330 --> 39:43.661
Cindi.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.450
Come on, baby, talk to me.

39:49.170 --> 39:50.785
Cindi, it's Derek.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.371
-Stop!
-Cindi, wait!

40:19.290 --> 40:22.202
He's gotten you to believe in a lie!
The Company is not real!

40:22.210 --> 40:24.030
I know. Derek,

40:24.040 --> 40:25.996
step aside.

40:42.380 --> 40:43.699
Let's go home.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.455
Okay.

40:49.420 --> 40:54.244
-Hi.
-Ma|colm Ford, you're under arrest

40:54.250 --> 40:56.992
for kidnapping, child endangerment,

40:57.000 --> 40:58.615
and the murder of John Hitchens.

40:59.920 --> 41:03.617
So, um, can you tell me that secret now?

41:09.380 --> 41:13.248
Anthony. Come here.

41:13.250 --> 41:16.617
This is your uncle.
He's come a long way to meet you.

41:17.080 --> 41:19.287
How you doing, Anthony?

41:19.670 --> 41:20.910
My name's Derek.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.529
You ready?

42:02.460 --> 42:03.870
I am so sorry.

43:08.380 --> 43:10.109
There's my hero.
