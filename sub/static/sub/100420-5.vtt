WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:11.511
In my line of work,
I meet a lot of big names.

00:11.594 --> 00:15.181
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s.
Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.891
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

00:16.975 --> 00:19.185
and these are the guys
we think are sexy, right?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.271
And my daughter couldn't care less.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.315
But when I told her
I was meeting BoJack Horseman...

00:24.399 --> 00:26.192
Do me a favor. Make her day.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.485
[sighs]

00:27.736 --> 00:29.779
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.615
Angela Diaz,
head of the network, calls me,

00:32.699 --> 00:34.451
working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

00:34.534 --> 00:39.080
and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',
and I want you to run 'Horsin' Around.'"

00:39.164 --> 00:41.624
So, here's me, thinking,
"What an opportunity

00:41.708 --> 00:44.502
to write for the most finely-calibrated
ensemble cast on television!"

00:44.586 --> 00:46.629
It's like a bowling alley
with you people.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.340
Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.092
-Uh.
-I know it's no secret

00:51.176 --> 00:52.552
that you and Herb had some friction,

00:52.635 --> 00:55.430
and he left the show
under not-great circumstances.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.390
Now I'm coming at this from a place of:

00:57.474 --> 01:00.060
This is your house,
and I'm a guest, all right?

01:00.310 --> 01:03.646
The magic of "Horsin' Around"
is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.941
I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.235
You're the special sauce, BoJack.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.657
And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.785
-You already told me this story.
-I did?

01:16.868 --> 01:20.080
Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.
We've been over it.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.749
-Well, did I tell you about Gina?
-Yes.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.043
-And Sarah Lynn?
-Multiple times. Yes.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.921
-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?
-You've told me everything.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.673
You told me about that dream
where you go to a dinner party.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.509
I even went down
that strange detour with you

01:32.592 --> 01:35.720
about the three-nippled woman in
the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.098
-Who was she?
-I think we're done here.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.392
-What do you mean, done?
-Well, you've been here six months.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.894
It's time to go home.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.938
[theme music playing]

02:38.116 --> 02:40.201
[Shannon] Oh, sorry. Uh, not this way.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.995
My boss is gonna kill me

02:42.078 --> 02:44.414
if I don't deliver these flowers
to his mistress.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.083
Well, we're filming
an episode of "Birthday Dad,"

02:47.167 --> 02:49.961
and my boss is gonna kill me
if I let anyone through.

02:50.044 --> 02:53.756
Great, when they discover my remains
scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.967
my loved ones will take solace
knowing I died

02:56.050 --> 02:58.803
so they could shoot an episode
of "Birthday Dad."

02:58.887 --> 03:01.514
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

03:03.141 --> 03:09.063
I know I couldn't always be there for you,
birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.733
I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.195
You really don't get it, do you?
This is the real world, okay?

03:15.278 --> 03:18.656
And I'm a career gal.
I don't have time for birthdays.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.742
But what about the birthday spirit?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.828
Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.789
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to drink my coffee.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.708
-Cut. Let's move on.
-[bell rings]

03:28.791 --> 03:30.668
Great take, Melodie. Chills.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.421
Are we Glenn Close,
Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline,

03:33.504 --> 03:35.924
and all of the greatest Motown singles
collected on one...

03:36.007 --> 03:37.050
[groans]

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
-[chuckles] "Big Chills."
-Hot herbal tea?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.970
-Yes, that would be-- Ooh!
-Ha!

03:41.054 --> 03:43.431
-Oops.
-[chuckles] Got me again, Audrey.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.475
Donna, we're gonna need another scarf.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.810
Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.730
No, what they're turned onto
is hating me...

03:50.813 --> 03:52.357
on account of I cheated on Pickles.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.775
Ever since the story went viral,

03:53.858 --> 03:57.028
the public has really mashed
the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.322
-Especially young women.
-Oh, no!

03:59.405 --> 04:02.659
"Especially Young Women"
is one of our show's eight target demos.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.868
We gotta juice your Q!

04:04.035 --> 04:06.955
Right now, the only juice
I'm interested in is Pickles' juice

04:07.038 --> 04:11.042
and making things kosher between us,
which is a task I relish.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.253
-So, you wanna have sex with me?
-Yes.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.880
And your fiancÃ©
is gonna be in there watching, or...

04:15.964 --> 04:17.715
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.551
This is not a fetish-based
cuckolding scenario.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.972
He had sex with his ex, so to level
the playing field now, we have to boink,

04:24.055 --> 04:26.891
so Mister and I can be even
and everything can go back to normal.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.809
You understand?

04:27.892 --> 04:29.519
Not really,
but I get to have sex with you?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.561
-Yeah.
-Correct.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.021
Then, cool. I'm in.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.108
-But what about your reputation?
-I'm not too worried about it.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.027
I feel like people
generally want to like me.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.864
And if I just don't do anything,
eventually, the universe will realign

04:41.948 --> 04:44.450
and the public will go back
to loving me again.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.411
-[grunts]
-Ugh.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.833
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.460
Not everyone appreciates
the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.130
-Are you starting your memoir today?
-That was the plan.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.882
But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.552
And once the morning's over,
basically the whole day is shot, you know?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.803
Better to start clean tomorrow.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.888
Look, I know it's hard
to start a new thing,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.349
but the hardest part is starting.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.267
You're right.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.478
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman
who pays child support,

05:12.562 --> 05:14.314
so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.773
Hmm.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.318
[indistinct chattering]

05:18.401 --> 05:20.778
Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone?

05:20.862 --> 05:24.532
I just wanted to raise
a non-alcoholic toast to Denise.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.451
-[laughter]
-Ha-ha!

05:26.534 --> 05:28.369
[man] Ow! My gluten intolerance!

05:28.453 --> 05:31.873
We've all been through so much together,
and it's never easy to say goodbye.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.459
-Remember when Doug left?
-[all] Hmm?

05:34.542 --> 05:36.210
-Or Jameson?
-[all muttering]

05:36.294 --> 05:37.420
Or sweet, sweet Bongo?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.131
-Sorry, who are we talking about?
-To Denise!

05:40.214 --> 05:41.674
[all] Denise!

05:41.758 --> 05:42.842
[man laughs]

05:43.259 --> 05:45.720
I didn't realize
we're the last of our original group.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.557
-God, we had some good times, huh?
-I mean, no, mostly.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.561
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?
-Ready or not, here I go.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.896
Yeah, you're ready.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.023
Have you given any thought
to what we discussed yesterday?

05:57.106 --> 06:00.234
About you transitioning to a version
of yourself that is no longer here?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.362
I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.364
Staying out of trouble,
got the fancy room,

06:04.447 --> 06:06.282
finally perfected
my egg-white omelet order.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.285
The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.579
[chuckles] You've already re-upped
three times.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.373
This place is for people in crisis.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.709
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen?

06:16.793 --> 06:21.255
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?
-Karmen, no.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.883
You sold your baby to a den of leeches
to pay for crack.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.261
-The leeches have your baby now.
-Oh, yeah.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.596
Ah. Classic Karm.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.348
It's natural to be hesitant.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.017
When I first checked out of rehab,
I was terrified.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.063
I knew a single drop of alcohol
would send me down a ruinous path.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.899
-But I found my way.
-Found your way back to rehab.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.610
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
-"Our?"

06:42.819 --> 06:44.487
A lot of people leave this place,

06:44.570 --> 06:47.907
and I think, "They're not gonna make it."
Like Denise, for example.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.369
But you?
You've done the work, and you're ready.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.621
You're a special case, BoJack.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.749
-I am?
-Of course you are.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.419
Huh.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.713
[Sharona] Oh, boy,
did he do a number on you.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.802
He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.846
And I think Danny
represents a fresh start.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.473
-Is that why you got Herb fired?
-Hey, I'm not the one who...

07:12.557 --> 07:15.059
I can't do your hair
if you're gonna move your head so much.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.853
There was nothing I could do about Herb.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.147
If it wasn't for me,
they would've canceled the whole show.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.314
And then where would you go?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.692
Who's gonna hire
a hair and makeup lady with shaky hands?

07:22.984 --> 07:26.446
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.
-Be sure to put that on your rÃ©sumÃ©.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.324
You're just bitter because I'm the only
person who can drink as much as you do.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.582
-[giggles]
-Ruthie!

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
-Here comes the airplane...
-[tires screech]

07:39.459 --> 07:41.836
-[car crashes]
-Oh, a kerfuffle!

07:41.919 --> 07:43.296
[people clamoring]

07:43.379 --> 07:45.131
Hey! What's going on out there?

07:45.423 --> 07:48.468
An ice cream truck
crashed into the root beer factory!

07:48.634 --> 07:51.512
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.265
-Five people are dead!
-Oh, no!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.850
And there's worse to come,

07:55.933 --> 07:59.437
unless somebody can slurp up
all that ice cream!

07:59.604 --> 08:03.983
Oh, I'd love to help slurp,
but I just started a new nannying job.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.569
I don't care!

08:06.736 --> 08:08.154
Hmm...

08:11.741 --> 08:14.660
Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.537
-Truly the end of an era.
-[crying]

08:16.621 --> 08:19.749
Sobby Bobby.
Gonna miss your excessive crying.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.666
Can't believe it.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.252
Last time I'm gonna stop
at this vending machine.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.797
What do you say, B-7?
One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

08:28.007 --> 08:31.177
[inhales] Whew.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.972
Oh, wow. Hello, the public.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.683
Didn't think I'd have to address this
so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.437
-Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab--
-Uh, keep it moving.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.730
We wanna get a clean shot

08:42.813 --> 08:47.902
for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion
disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.571
-Joey Pogo?
-Yeah, he's checking in today.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.616
-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
-Fancy room?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.787
He's gettin' the fancy room.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.289
-It's time to go home.
-What?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.582
Ready or not.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.085
I got the fancy room.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.588
He's gettin' the fancy room.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.216
You're a special case, BoJack.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.386
Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.054
What does it all mean?

09:15.137 --> 09:17.473
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.391
Huh?

09:18.474 --> 09:23.646
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.564
Oh, my God.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.109
I think they're kicking me out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.196
I just feel like if I knew
the source of my addiction,

09:32.280 --> 09:34.699
everything else would just click together.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.908
-Playtime's over.
-BoJack!

09:35.992 --> 09:38.452
-What the hell? This is my time.
-Shut up, Brad.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.996
The source of your addiction

09:40.079 --> 09:43.291
is wanting to impress your old babysitter
who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.542
She's dead. You're free.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.835
No, that's not...

09:45.918 --> 09:46.752
Oh. Oh...

09:46.836 --> 09:48.462
I thought you were checking out.

09:48.546 --> 09:54.051
-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?
-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.845
Well, check this out.

09:55.928 --> 10:00.182
BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...

10:00.266 --> 10:01.392
What is he doing?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.978
I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.980
You have to imagine that I just said it.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.441
It's only funny
if it feels extemporaneous.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.277
Don't waste your breath setting it up,
just say the thing.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.362
-Why don't you start over?
-Check this out.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.616
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.868
That's a no-go, bro.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.661
Worth it.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.204
[car horns blaring]

10:22.288 --> 10:25.082
I'm sorry. Please, go around.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.003
I worked on it all night.
The thing that's gonna save your career.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.838
Ha!

10:30.921 --> 10:33.966
-What is it?
-It's a meme! For posting online!

10:34.050 --> 10:36.552
Teacher gave you too much homework?
"Sad Dog!"

10:36.636 --> 10:39.597
Your favorite sports outfit
lost the match? "Sad Dog!"

10:39.680 --> 10:42.433
People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.603
But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.229
-So, it needs some massaging.
-[phone rings]

10:47.313 --> 10:48.314
Hold on, I gotta take this.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.901
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!"
See how easy it is?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.362
-[phone beeps]
-Pickles! How was your date with Carl?

10:54.570 --> 10:55.571
I don't know, Mister.

10:55.655 --> 11:00.284
The sex was good, like, really good,
but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.912
Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.581
But part of the betrayal
of you sleeping with Diane

11:05.665 --> 11:07.833
is the fact that you share
an intimate history.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.921
If we're really trying to even things out,
I don't think Carl counts.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.675
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have
to keep having sex with people

11:15.758 --> 11:18.386
until you find someone with whom you have
an emotional connection.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.805
[sighs] That might be a lot of guys,

11:20.888 --> 11:23.849
but if that's what it's gonna take
to save our marriage,

11:23.933 --> 11:28.020
I will keep riding the express train
to bone-town until that happens.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.855
That's my girl.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
-Oh! Thank you.
-[phone ringing]

11:32.692 --> 11:33.651
-[beeps]
-Hello?

11:33.734 --> 11:34.652
Hey, it's Diane.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.738
Oh, yes, I thought I heard
retired dads in the distance,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.532
praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.867
Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book,

11:41.951 --> 11:45.454
but I shouldn't even get started
until I sell it to a publisher, right?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.873
-What is it?
-I'm still in the loose idea phase.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.458
Half essay, half memoir.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.543
The working title is,

11:50.626 --> 11:54.171
"One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to God
I'll Shut Up About This Forever:

11:54.255 --> 11:57.717
A Definitive Retrospective
of the Choices We Make,

11:57.800 --> 12:01.429
People We Hurt,
The Places We Go: Part One."

12:01.512 --> 12:04.598
How could it be part one if it's
definitive? I'm getting another call.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.516
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.143
Hi, while you were blabbering on,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.854
I had our lit assistant
take care of everything.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.940
A navel-gazey book of observations.
Sounds fun.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.734
-No, I--
-I sold it. You have six months.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.110
Enjoy the process.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.153
Oh.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.531
[groans]

12:22.700 --> 12:23.534
Wha...

12:25.453 --> 12:27.580
What happened?
You're packing your things backwards.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.665
What happened is you said I was special.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.834
You gave a whole spiel,
just trying to get rid of me

12:31.917 --> 12:33.878
to make room
for a high-profile new client.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.046
I thought we'd made strides
on your jealousy issues.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.673
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

12:37.757 --> 12:40.634
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely
seen it written out as "spiel."

12:40.718 --> 12:43.596
I think it's spelled "spiel,"
but it's pronounced "shpeel."

12:43.679 --> 12:44.930
Not now, Joey Pogo.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.726
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
I was told I was in the fancy room?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.353
We're moving some things around.
Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.897
Oh, tomorrow is jammed.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.107
I'm shootin' a video
for my new single, "Lace Up,"

12:55.191 --> 12:57.985
which is spon-con
for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.864
-Could we just do it now, real quick?
-You wanna do rehab real quick?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.825
Life is precious. God is religious,
or merely the idea of human connection.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.285
Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.497
Powerful stuff.
Feels like I just got a new lease on life.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.123
Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.335
That's the problem. When you say it
in here, it all sounds easy.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.796
But I know that out there,
it's hard and confusing.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.173
-And it's just-- I-I don't...
-But you're not alone.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.133
You have a wonderful support system.

13:21.217 --> 13:26.889
Think of all your amazing friends,
just waiting to love you as you love them.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.516
[groaning]

13:28.974 --> 13:30.226
[vibrates, beeps]

13:30.309 --> 13:32.520
Todd's phone. What if Todd was one of us?

13:32.728 --> 13:34.814
Um, okay. Is Todd there?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.857
-Please hold for the next available Todd.
-[beeps]

13:36.941 --> 13:37.775
Okay.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.069
["Ode to Joy" tune] âª Todd, Todd, Todd,
Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd âª

13:40.152 --> 13:42.613

-Ugh!

13:42.696 --> 13:45.032
âª Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd
Todd, Todd, Todd âª

13:45.199 --> 13:46.659
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, listen, I'm...

13:46.742 --> 13:48.577
You're probably wondering about Georgette,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.413
-the newest member of Team Chavez.
-Nope.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.124
Since I've started
taking care of Ruthie full-time,

13:54.208 --> 13:57.711
that hasn't given me a lot of time
for regular Todd business,

13:57.795 --> 13:59.672
and stuff's been falling
through the cracks.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.131
So, you hired an assistant?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.884
Well, yes, but assistants
are like Deadpool movies.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.137
I couldn't just stop at one,
even though I probably should have.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.806
Now I have 12.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.852
You hired 12 assistants? To assist you?

14:12.935 --> 14:16.355
Yep, I've got Bella
trying out new goofy dances,

14:16.438 --> 14:19.650
Pedro's monitoring
all the Five Guys franchises

14:19.733 --> 14:22.570
to make sure each one
has the right number of guys,

14:22.653 --> 14:25.030
-and Silvia's in charge of checking...
-[clock ringing]

14:25.114 --> 14:29.285
-...All About That Ace every 15 minutes.
-What is "All About That Ace?"

14:29.368 --> 14:32.580
My asexual dating app.
I think I might be the only one on it.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.124
-[Ruthie giggles]
-But another ace could join any day now.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.751
And when that happens, two of a kind.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.421
Well, I guess that makes about
as much sense as the rest of it.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.632
Listen, um, I might be getting out
of rehab soon...

14:43.716 --> 14:45.259
BoJack, that's fantastic!

14:45.342 --> 14:50.264
...and I wanted to talk to you
because I, uh...

14:50.431 --> 14:51.557
[sighs]

14:51.932 --> 14:54.727
can't do this by myself.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.188
Hey, I got you, buddy.
You just wait one jiffy.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.987
[sighs]

15:05.070 --> 15:05.905
-Hi.
-Ah!

15:06.280 --> 15:09.074
I'm Casey, the assistant.
Todd hired me to be your friend.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.911
Okay, that's, uh, you know...
I think I'm good. Thank you.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.705
He said I would be perfect for you
because you could be mean to me

15:14.788 --> 15:16.707
and you wouldn't feel bad
because you're paying me.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.084
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.630
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be
very discreet, whatever you need.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.633
Marc Cherry used to dress me
in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in

15:25.716 --> 15:27.176
and scream at me for hours on end.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.929
It was very therapeutic for him,
and I didn't mind

15:30.012 --> 15:32.598
because he wasn't screaming at me,
he was screaming at death.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.600
Stars really are just like us, huh?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.685
-Do you mind if I have a sip?
-Don't drink that!

15:36.769 --> 15:39.647
Right, of course.
I must earn hydration. So sorry.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.815
No, it's just... That's vodka.

15:41.899 --> 15:45.069
You think it's a good idea
to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.780
Because it is if you think it is.

15:47.863 --> 15:48.906
It's not for drinking.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.952
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.

15:53.702 --> 15:54.536
Of what?

15:55.454 --> 15:56.538
[BoJack] Sarah Lynn?

15:57.623 --> 15:58.832
Sarah Lynn?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.042
Sarah Lynn!

16:00.376 --> 16:01.835
-What?
-Are you almost done?

16:01.919 --> 16:04.672
I need Sharona to work that magic
on her mane man.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.132
Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.
Cool your jets.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.176
Why can't you do this
in Sarah Lynn's dressing room?

16:09.259 --> 16:11.679
My stepdad's in there,
and he's being weird.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.473
-Why is that my problem?
-We appreciate your hospitality.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.642
Hey, BoJack,
what do you think of the new guy?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.268
Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

16:18.352 --> 16:20.521
-I miss Herb.
-We all do, sweetie.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.649
Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?
We got a job to do, right?

16:23.732 --> 16:25.109
I'm just saying I miss him.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.653
And I'm just saying
it's not my fault he got fired.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.655
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.
-I'm sorry.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.031
Nobody said it was your fault.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.283
I actually think
Danny represents an opportunity.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.201
For a new beginning.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.414
You don't think it feels weird
to do the show without Herb?

16:38.497 --> 16:41.041
If Herb really cared about the show,
maybe he shouldn't have...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.126
What? Been gay?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.128
No, that's not-- Obviously...

16:44.211 --> 16:46.463
-I put my ass on the line for you people.
-Ugh. BoJack.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.883
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?
Herb was gonna throw that all away.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.885
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.930
-I... I don't know.
-BoJack, she's ten!

16:55.014 --> 16:57.224
Yeah, which is basically an adult
in Hollywood years.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.893
I'm trying to make this situation work.
Enjoy my dressing room.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.939
[sighs] Hey, I know you feel shitty,
but don't take it out on a little girl.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.608
[BoJack] I don't feel shitty,
I feel great!

17:10.821 --> 17:13.323
Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?

17:13.407 --> 17:16.702
It's because I think I'm special
and the rules don't apply to me.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.912
And I keep thinking that
over and over again.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.873
-Well, you are special.
-No, shut up.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.916
-[gasps]
-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.961
All your bosses are assholes.
And people like you indulge us.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.505
And you soothe our egos,
and you let us abuse you.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.675
-You're right, I'm terrible.
-No, God damn it. That's not my point.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.260
Have some respect for yourself.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.096
Okay, sorry.
I'm just happy to be a part of things.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.432
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.436
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.564
Can you run downstairs
and grab me some Funyuns?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.233
-Mm... No.
-What do you mean, no?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.693
Huh.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.739
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.409
-Uh, what's happening?
-There's an "I" in assistants.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.579
And this time, the "I" is us.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.207
I like your energy, but what?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.542
And lo and behold,
my sandwich has onions...

18:05.626 --> 18:06.460
[phone beeps]

18:06.543 --> 18:10.255
...when I specifically meant
to tell you I didn't want onions.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.298
Where are you going?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.884
-So, this lawyer's got attitude.
-[phone buzzes]

18:13.967 --> 18:16.553
And that attitude? Autism.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.348
I don't understand,
why is this person moving now?

18:19.431 --> 18:20.808
Wait! What's goin' on?

18:20.891 --> 18:24.144
The Hollywoo Assistants are unionizing.
This is a walk-out.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.230
No! I've grown too dependent on you!

18:26.313 --> 18:28.690
I can't perform
basic Todd functions anymore!

18:28.774 --> 18:32.402
I'm like a toddler, but a Todd version.
A Toddler!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.826
I know you got a job to do,
but is there any way...

18:38.909 --> 18:40.953
-[phone beeps]
-...Joey Pogo could get through?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.913
Just got out of rehab,
I'm trying to get home.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.624
-Knock yourself out.
-All right!

18:45.958 --> 18:49.628
Don't die on me, Ileanna.
Not on your birthday, of all days!

18:49.711 --> 18:53.090
Year after year,
the only thing I wished for was a dad.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.259
[sobs] And now you're here,
and it's like...

18:55.342 --> 18:57.928
[coughs] paging Doctor Birthday!

18:58.011 --> 19:00.806
But if you just told me your wish,
that means it won't come true!

19:00.889 --> 19:05.936
You really don't get it, do you?
It already has. [gasps]

19:06.145 --> 19:08.230
I love you, Birthday Eric.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.108
No. Birthday Dad.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.777
-[groans]

19:13.861 --> 19:15.279
-[director] And cut.
-[bell rings]

19:15.362 --> 19:16.530
Wow, Melodie.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.741
Are you Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland,
Barbra Streisand, Lady Ga--

19:19.825 --> 19:21.118
Drop dead.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.161
Star is Born.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.745
-[car honking]
-Huh?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.706
-[gasps, grunts]
-Whoa!

19:25.998 --> 19:28.834
Ah! Buddy, what the hell are you doing?
Get out of the way!

19:28.917 --> 19:30.335
-Uh...
-I saw the whole thing.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.964
Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I'm a sad dog,"
and jumped right in front of the car.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.134
I think he's a really sad dog, you guys.
You know, like the meme.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.012
-[all gasping]
-Oh, my God, I had no idea.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.932
Mr. Peanutbutter, life is precious.
That's something you hear a lot in rehab.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.810
Hey, why'd you try to kill yourself,
you stupid idiot?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.478
-Um...
-I'm no psychiatrist,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.273
but it's probably because
he's such a sad dog!

19:51.356 --> 19:52.858
[gasps] Mr. Peanutbutter,

19:52.941 --> 19:55.277
we didn't realize
you have a mental illness.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.654
Thank you for getting the word out
about depression.

19:57.738 --> 20:02.409
You are truly a hero for destigmatizing
this all-too-common affliction.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.952
Yes, a hero!

20:04.036 --> 20:06.079
And to see more of this hero in action,

20:06.163 --> 20:09.291
tune in to "Birthday Dad" this spring
on MBN!

20:09.374 --> 20:10.584
Uh-huh.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.004
Mr. Peanutbutter, I think I sing
for everyone when I say...

20:14.087 --> 20:17.799
âª Don't hurt yourself, we love you âª

20:17.883 --> 20:19.801
[all cheering]

20:19.885 --> 20:22.012
Oh, so I guess this all worked out.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.639
-Huh?
-Oh.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.934
-Depressingly, that is.
-[chuckles]

20:27.351 --> 20:28.936
[truck beeping]

20:30.062 --> 20:32.397
I saw your new assistant leave.
Why aren't you packed?

20:32.481 --> 20:34.066
I can't. Please don't make me.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.443
-You don't know what I'm like out there.
-Let's find out.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.570
-Hey, that's--
-I won't coddle this anymore.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.782
You're scared? Good.
Go to AA meetings. Go to a psychiatrist.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.325
But what pisses me off

20:43.408 --> 20:46.370
is when you take a bed that someone else
could be using to get better.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.205
Isn't it possible
I'm one of those people

20:48.288 --> 20:50.457
that would benefit
from staying here indefinitely?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.167
No. You're not that special.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.295
And you don't belong here anymore.
Pack your things.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.505
[huffs]

20:56.588 --> 20:58.924
[inhales] Don't belong here, huh?

21:01.551 --> 21:02.678
[sniffs]

21:03.845 --> 21:06.682
[spits, gags] God, what am I doing?

21:07.182 --> 21:08.016
[grunts]

21:08.100 --> 21:10.602
[whistles tune]

21:10.686 --> 21:12.562
No! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.898
-[panting]
-[Bobby crying]

21:18.860 --> 21:20.487
Nobody drink any water!

21:20.570 --> 21:22.656
[gulping]

21:23.198 --> 21:24.491
[belches] Ooh.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.575
[gasps]

21:26.451 --> 21:28.078
[door opens, closes]

21:29.288 --> 21:30.664
Wow, look at you go.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.666
-You can't look at it yet!
-Okay, okay!

21:32.749 --> 21:34.876
Sorry. I was just kind of in it, you know?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.003
Yeah? It's going good?

21:36.211 --> 21:39.631
Yeah, you were right.
Once I got started, it was easy.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.926
So much of my career has been
writing for and about other people,

21:43.010 --> 21:44.720
and how terrible everything is.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.347
It's actually really refreshing
to just focus on myself, you know?

21:47.431 --> 21:51.560
Well, I don't want to interrupt your flow.
Please, write on.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.487
[Doctor Champ] Oh, this is a fine
how do you do.

22:02.779 --> 22:07.117
Brad was like, "It's difficult to have
a hot name, but not be that hot."

22:07.200 --> 22:09.619
Can you believe that?
He's extremely attractive, no?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.789
-I don't...
-And honestly, is Brad a hot name?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.207
-Brad Pitt, yes.
-Ugh.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.960
But like, name one other handsome Brad.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.420
-Bradley Cooper.
-Damn it!

22:18.503 --> 22:22.507
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.551
Uh, duh!

22:24.634 --> 22:28.013
-Jesus.
-âª I'm drunk! âª

22:28.096 --> 22:30.807
Shh! Shut up.
If anyone hears you, there's gonna be...

22:30.891 --> 22:32.142
I forgot how fun this is.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.186
-Just settle down, okay?
-Ah!

22:34.269 --> 22:36.355
You're gonna spend the night here
and sober up.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.566
Oh, so it's easy to be sober
all the sudden.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.985
[slurring] Look who thinks
it's easy sober, hmm?

22:42.069 --> 22:43.487
Shh! Doctor Champ!

22:43.570 --> 22:47.407
It's so easy. Everything, very easy.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.160
-[snores]
-[sighs]

22:51.286 --> 22:52.621
-[elevator dings]
-[laughter]

22:52.704 --> 22:56.917
-[grunting]
-Hey, Horse.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.961
Bad news about the Manzanita lawsuit.
You think he'll settle?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.671
Settle? Manzanita?

23:01.755 --> 23:05.258
I'd say that's about as likely
as my daughter Sabrina skipping school

23:05.342 --> 23:07.886
and sneaking into the office with me
in my work luggage!

23:07.969 --> 23:10.931
[audience laughter]

23:11.014 --> 23:11.890
-Uh...
-Uh...

23:11.973 --> 23:13.308
-[director] Cut!
-[bells rings]

23:14.017 --> 23:16.436
Listen, you're doing great.
Slight change of plans, though.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.606
Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode

23:19.689 --> 23:22.692
to being about you
not bringing Sabrina to the office.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.819
Is she okay?

23:23.902 --> 23:27.280
Uh, only reason I'm telling you this
is you're my main guy here,

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
and I know you want
what's best for everyone.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.702
-Of course.
-Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.704
-Oh, my God.
-Her mother is apoplectic.

23:34.788 --> 23:35.789
She wants to sue.

23:35.872 --> 23:39.709
I think it's just big talk,
but someone needs to be held accountable.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.294
And as the guys in charge here,

23:41.378 --> 23:45.006
we're responsible
for figuring out who that's gonna be.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.175
-What are you...
-I need you to be straight with me.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.053
-That wasn't your alcohol, right?
-Oh, I don't...

23:50.137 --> 23:51.346
It wasn't, right?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.932
Because if it was,
we're all in real trouble.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.017
-You get what I'm saying.
-Y-Yeah.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.229
So, you don't know
where she got the alcohol from?

23:59.312 --> 24:00.647
Yeah. I have no idea.

24:00.730 --> 24:04.067
Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.902
Well, don't look at me.

24:06.319 --> 24:07.320
Hmm...

24:07.404 --> 24:11.575
-What?
-Nothing. Just a little uneven, is all.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.547
Oh. I'm screwed. I'm so screwed.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.466
-It's gonna be okay.
-No!

24:27.549 --> 24:30.760
I'm drunk. Not okay.
You can't let anyone know about this.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.888
-Shush!
-Yeah. Shh.

24:32.971 --> 24:37.017
You gotta stay with me until I sober up.
I can't be alone here like this.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.643
It's okay, I'm here.

24:38.727 --> 24:43.023
Yeah, be here.
You need to stay here, BoJack.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.109
Please. Stay.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.447
âª Back in the '90s âª

24:50.530 --> 24:55.869
âª I was in a very famous TV show âª

24:57.662 --> 24:59.915
-âª I'm BoJack the horseman âª
-âª BoJack âª

24:59.998 --> 25:05.003
âª BoJack the horseman
Don't act like you don't know âª

25:07.047 --> 25:11.343
âª And I'm trying to hold onto my past âª

25:11.426 --> 25:15.805
âª It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last âª

25:16.223 --> 25:19.768
âª I guess I'm just trying
To make you understand âª

25:19.851 --> 25:24.064
âª That I'm more horse than a man âª

25:24.147 --> 25:28.318
âª Or I'm more man than a horse âª

25:28.401 --> 25:29.778
âª BoJack âª
