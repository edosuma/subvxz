WEBVTT

00:05.309 --> 00:08.008
- I've been down an assistant,
and I need someone

00:08.051 --> 00:10.140
who can keep the trains running
at one of the most

00:10.184 --> 00:12.664
complex health institutions
in the country.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.318
- I have specialized
in logistics

00:14.362 --> 00:18.148
at not-for-profits with
client bases north of 100,000.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.237
- Well, I oversaw
operational budgets

00:20.281 --> 00:22.065
at best-in-class
public hospitals

00:22.109 --> 00:23.588
in Boston and Philadelphia.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.503
- Boston andPhiladelphia.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.157
Uh, you'll need
to be proficient

00:27.201 --> 00:30.204
in a bunch of boring yet very
complicated admin software

00:30.247 --> 00:32.336
that, uh, frankly,
I don't know how to use.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.424
- I have four years experience

00:33.468 --> 00:35.774
consulting on
next-gen EHR coding.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.385
- Well,
I've secured multiple grants

00:37.428 --> 00:40.040
to install electronic records
systems at rural hospitals.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.693
- Wow, is that a pie chart?

00:41.737 --> 00:42.694
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.609
- It's very...detailed.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.481
- I don't own a computer.

00:48.787 --> 00:51.399
- You don't, um...

00:51.442 --> 00:54.315
Any medical sector experience,
or?

00:54.358 --> 00:56.186
No, sir.

00:56.230 --> 00:57.187
- No.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.319
It's, uh--

00:58.362 --> 01:01.191
- Todd Benson.
- Todd Benson, yeah.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.672
Uh, quick question, buddy,
I don't mean to be rude,

01:03.715 --> 01:05.369
but are you sure
you're at the right interview?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.936
- Yes sir, um,

01:06.979 --> 01:09.721
I've had a little trouble
transitioning from my last job.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.506
- Which was what, exactly?

01:11.549 --> 01:12.507
- Well, on a given day,

01:12.550 --> 01:14.422
I would organize
information flow

01:14.465 --> 01:16.859
between the British,
the French, the Afghans,

01:16.902 --> 01:20.123
and 90 Chinook helicopters.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.298
- You're a veteran.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.474
- Yes, sir.
Army, four tours.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.868
- Is that on your, uh, résumé?
- No, sir.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.784
I found that it
freaks some people out.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.568
- Oh, right.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.744
Well, uh, Todd,

01:32.788 --> 01:34.529
I'm sorry to say this,

01:34.572 --> 01:37.314
but I don't know
if you're the right...fit.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.535
As much as I'm deeply indebted
for your service.

01:41.753 --> 01:45.148
- I need this job,
Dr. Goodwin.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.324
My VA insurance
can't cover a gopher hole,

01:47.368 --> 01:49.761
and more than that, I...

01:49.805 --> 01:52.460
I need a place
to feel useful again.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.767
- Well, um, how about this?

01:55.811 --> 01:58.901
Why don't I have HR keep you
in mind for something that, uh,

01:58.944 --> 02:00.685
better suits your skill set?

02:00.729 --> 02:03.514
- I spent six years
in the Middle East,

02:03.558 --> 02:05.168
coordinating four languages,

02:05.212 --> 02:07.605
$3 billion worth
of military gear,

02:07.649 --> 02:10.434
and the lives of my friends.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.610
I may not know computers,

02:12.654 --> 02:16.266
but if there is one thing my
skill set definitely includes,

02:16.310 --> 02:19.313
it's knowing how to
make the trains run on time.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.619
All I'm asking
is you give me a shot.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.412
- Welcome to--

02:35.459 --> 02:36.721
- I am so sorry,

02:36.765 --> 02:38.854
but in order for
the drug tests to be valid,

02:38.897 --> 02:41.204
I have to, um, to watch.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.424
- Well, I have peed in front
of you a million times.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.730
You just weren't the
deputy medical director then.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.732
And, my job didn't
depend on the results,

02:47.776 --> 02:49.169
and you know what?

02:49.212 --> 02:51.171
I kinda wish I hadn't worn
such sexy underwear.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.783
How about we
change the subject?

02:54.826 --> 02:56.263
I'm thinking about adopting--

02:56.306 --> 02:58.700
- I have been having sex
with my physical therapist.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.832
- What?
No.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.051
Zach Ligon?

03:02.094 --> 03:03.748
- I know, I know, I know,
he's the worst.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.273
- He is smug and shallow, and--

03:06.316 --> 03:08.449
- I needed a distraction, okay?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.233
- He's your doctor!
- He's my colleague.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.235
Who then tragically
became my doctor,

03:12.279 --> 03:13.758
but you know what?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.978
I'm totally over it and
it's never gonna happen again.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.546
- I mean, I shouldn't judge.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.983
After all, this is the most
intimate I've been anybody

03:21.026 --> 03:23.246
since Akash and I broke up.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.379
- Then I am glad that
I wore my sexy underwear.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.514
Oh...
I don't know.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.561
Before the crash, I thought
I'd figured it all out.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.607
Not just with him,
but as a doctor.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.087
- You know what?
Don't do that.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.915
Look, it didn't work out
with a guy you were dating.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.612
Join the club.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.310
You're killing it as a doctor.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.877
Look how much money you raised
for precision oncology.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.445
- "Dr. Helen" raised
that money, not Dr. Sharpe.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.751
- Oh, God.

03:49.794 --> 03:53.015
Don't be so quick
to discount your celebrity.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.538
'Cause life...

03:54.582 --> 03:56.932
it's a little bit
like a drug test.

03:56.975 --> 04:00.240
It counts more...
when people watch.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.418
- You have the face of a man

04:04.461 --> 04:05.854
who just paid off
his student loans.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.943
- Hey, Evie's coming back
from San Fran tomorrow.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.901
- Been six weeks already?
That went fast.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.338
For you.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.557
I'm planning a wedding
by myself.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.603
-  I can't relate
to people in love.

04:18.432 --> 04:22.305
- Renée, Renée, Renée...

04:22.349 --> 04:23.915
- Don't say it, Dr. Reynolds.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.352
- Well, what's it been?

04:25.395 --> 04:27.789
Two weeks since our
coronary artery bypass?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.444
Looks like you reopened the
vein at the extraction site.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.489
- I fell.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.448
- Well, that's quite a fall,
Renée.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.014
- The fall wasn't so bad.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.974
It's just that
I couldn't get up.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.323
- How long
were you on the ground?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
- 14 hours.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.762
- Renée.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.416
- I know, I know.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.506
Ever since Patrick passed,

04:49.550 --> 04:51.291
it's just been me.

04:51.334 --> 04:54.381
- Well, who found you?
- The delivery man.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.992
He knocked on my door
by mistake.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.081
He was looking
for my neighbor.

04:59.124 --> 05:02.345
It was so humiliating.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.696
- No, come on.
No, hey...

05:05.740 --> 05:07.524
I'm here.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.614
I'm gonna get you fixed up,
all right?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.616
- Vince Martinelli, 47.

05:12.660 --> 05:15.576
BP 80 over 40, he's tachy
with a heart rate of 130.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.621
Diaphoretic and showing signs
of dehydration.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.449
Found him collapsed at a
construction site over on 19th.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.624
- Thanks,
we'll take him from here.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.626
Mr. Martinelli?
My name is Dr. Bloom.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.324
- Am I dying?
- Not if I can help it.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.673
Let's hang
a liter of PlasmaLyte.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.152
We're gonna run another EKG

05:27.196 --> 05:28.763
to figure out what's going on
with your heart, okay?

05:28.806 --> 05:29.981
Has this ever happened to you
before?

05:30.025 --> 05:31.635
- No, never.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.637
Been feeling like I was coming
down with the flu all week,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.160
and then this happened.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.814
- Well, good news is you're
not having a heart attack.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.076
- When can I be
back on the job?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.382
- One step at a time, okay?

05:39.426 --> 05:40.688
- No hours, no pay, Doc.

05:40.731 --> 05:43.125
- I get it, but there is
something going on.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.648
You notice
anything else recently?

05:44.692 --> 05:46.781
- Yeah, well...

05:50.437 --> 05:51.829
My pee...

05:51.873 --> 05:54.441
I've seen some blood in there,
too.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.791
That's bad, right?

06:04.189 --> 06:06.409
- Todd, I know that
your military service

06:06.453 --> 06:09.020
has instilled in you
a deep respect for rank,

06:09.064 --> 06:11.066
but if you're gonna replace
my old assistant,

06:11.109 --> 06:13.024
then I need you to be
way less respectful.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.461
- Yes, sir.
- No, sir!

06:14.504 --> 06:16.376
See, there's no sir-ing
at New Amsterdam.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.682
Just loosen up,
speak your mind, you know?

06:18.726 --> 06:19.988
- Yo, Max,
wait up.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.556
- Yeah, see, Dr. Reynolds
is a perfect example

06:22.599 --> 06:24.427
of our informal,
laid-back vibe.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.689
- Uh, permission
to speak freely?

06:25.733 --> 06:27.517
- Granted.
- Todd--

06:27.561 --> 06:28.779
- I got a post-op patient

06:28.823 --> 06:30.215
who has just readmitted
after falling.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.043
Now I gotta stitch up
her graft on her leg, again.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.480
- Medicare should cover
the surgery.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.742
- Well, they should.

06:34.785 --> 06:35.786
What they don't cover
is the in-house checkups

06:35.830 --> 06:36.918
my patient really needs

06:36.961 --> 06:38.049
to make sure
she doesn't come back again.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.442
- You're talking about
a live-in nurse?

06:39.486 --> 06:40.922
- No, no, Max,
just check-ups.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.706
Look--this isn't the first time
this has happened here.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.534
Unless we do something,
it won't be the last.

06:44.578 --> 06:45.796
- All right, I'm on it.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.450
I will take it to the board
this morning.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
- Yes, sir.
- Nope, don't start that.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.105
- Yes, sir.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.715
- That's not a thing!

06:57.765 --> 06:58.722
Is it possible

06:58.766 --> 06:59.767
we got the wrong day?

06:59.810 --> 07:02.422
Or...time or, uh, place?

07:02.465 --> 07:03.727
Is this the right room?

07:03.771 --> 07:06.077
- Well,
you're five minutes early.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.645
- How did that happen?
- Punctuality shows discipline.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.255
If you can't rely on someone

07:10.299 --> 07:13.781
to be on time, how can you rely
on them for anything else?

07:13.824 --> 07:17.741
- Guess we've just been...
kind of winging it, Todd.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.222
- Vince Martinelli's labs,
hot off the press.

07:21.789 --> 07:24.966
- Normal, normal, normal,
within range...

07:25.009 --> 07:26.402
wait, wait--

07:26.446 --> 07:28.796
his cobalt serum value
is 60 micrograms per liter?

07:28.839 --> 07:30.624
- Cobalt poisoning.
How'd he get that?

07:30.667 --> 07:32.016
- Okay, uh, page Sharpe

07:32.060 --> 07:33.801
and get the Department
of Public Health on the line.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.891
We may need to shut down
his construction site.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.242
- Resolve to renew
our partnership

07:40.285 --> 07:42.505
with Le Bernardin
for next year's gala.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.941
Second?

07:43.985 --> 07:46.596
The motion proceeds.
All in favor?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.816
Then très bien
for Le Bernardin.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.907
Next item, the gala's theme.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.212
I'm thinking...

07:54.256 --> 07:55.953
masquerade.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.999
- Point of order, uh...

07:58.042 --> 07:59.217
Sorry,
am I saying that right?

07:59.261 --> 08:00.697
Is it point of order?

08:00.741 --> 08:02.786
- It's a thing you can say.

08:02.830 --> 08:03.918
- Good, point of order.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.789
This is a waste of time.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.748
Uh, masquerade,
no masquerade--

08:07.791 --> 08:09.140
doesn't really matter.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.794
I'd like to talk about
Renée Hamrick.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.100
- Max, we have an agenda--

08:12.143 --> 08:14.972
- Renée Hamrick
had heart surgery here

08:15.016 --> 08:16.583
three weeks ago,
and she made it.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.628
But because
of nonexistent post-op care,

08:18.672 --> 08:21.152
she ended up back
in our hospital today,

08:21.196 --> 08:23.764
to do it all over again.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.548
So I would like to propose

08:25.592 --> 08:28.725
the New Amsterdam
Visiting Nurses Agency.

08:28.769 --> 08:30.814
We sent select nurses
to our patients' homes

08:30.858 --> 08:32.207
to provide after-care check-ins

08:32.250 --> 08:34.949
and at this year's gala
we can all raise a glass,

08:34.992 --> 08:36.907
knowing that
what happened to Renée Hamrick

08:36.951 --> 08:39.040
will never happen again.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.781
All in favor?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.565
- Someone has to second.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.307
- Can I get a second?

08:45.350 --> 08:47.222
Can I get a second?

08:47.265 --> 08:48.615
- No second.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.226
Dr. Goodwin's
characteristically uplifting

08:51.269 --> 08:55.012
yet exorbitantly priced
proposal is rejected.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.711
Next topic: Selecting
our newest board member.

08:57.754 --> 08:58.755
- That's it?
This is our--

08:58.799 --> 08:59.800
- The binders in front of you

08:59.843 --> 09:01.671
have a bio
of Lamont Hallstrom.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.978
Lamont is a top dog
at AQP's hedge fund

09:04.021 --> 09:05.588
and he's eager to serve.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.851
Now, we vote tomorrow morning,
10:30 sharp.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.592
But since
he's running unopposed--

09:09.636 --> 09:12.160
- Yeah, actually,
he's not running unopposed,

09:12.203 --> 09:13.857
and correct me if I'm wrong,

09:13.901 --> 09:16.164
but our by-laws state that any
member can nominate candidates,

09:16.207 --> 09:18.688
so as a member...

09:18.732 --> 09:21.604
I happen to have
the perfect candidate in mind.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.216
- So, who's your
perfect candidate?

09:25.260 --> 09:28.045
- No idea, Todd, but I've got
24 hours to figure that out.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.873
- Oh, so you lied
to your superior?

09:34.051 --> 09:36.924
- The board is what you get
when power is in the hands

09:36.967 --> 09:38.316
of rich people whose only
friends are other rich people

09:38.360 --> 09:40.144
who've never even met
a regular guy like you or me.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.232
- But you're rich.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.625
- Me?
No, not by a long shot.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.062
- Are you debt-free
and making six figures a year?

09:45.106 --> 09:46.977
- Uh, well--
- Then you're rich.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.762
- Yeah, but not, like,
rich-rich.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.242
- Are most of your friends
other doctors?

09:51.286 --> 09:52.287
- I mean, kind of, but--

09:52.330 --> 09:53.505
- So then
your friends are rich.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.072
What are you getting at, Todd?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.639
- Well, actually,
you're a lot like the board.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.206
- I'm like those guys?
No, no, no.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.555
They--they're board people,
okay?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.643
They all went to Harvard.

10:00.687 --> 10:01.644
- Where'd you go?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.124
- Brown,
but that's liberal Ivy.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.168
It's totally different.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.343
- Okay.
- You know what, Todd?

10:05.387 --> 10:06.606
You're dismissed.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.176
- Rohan Beta!

10:13.264 --> 10:14.439
Is there a game tonight?

10:14.483 --> 10:15.745
Did I forget to put it
in my calendar?

10:15.789 --> 10:19.009
- No, no,
we didn't have plans.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.010
I have some news.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.011
- News?

10:21.055 --> 10:22.404
Come, sit, sit.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.493
What is your news?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.626
- Um...my band...

10:26.669 --> 10:29.629
we, uh, kind of have
this cool thing going.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.369
- What cool thing?

10:31.413 --> 10:33.720
- It's a tour, a big tour.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.199
Huge, actually.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.027
We're gonna be on the road
for months.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.115
Now,
I know you don't approve--

10:38.159 --> 10:39.116
- No, no, no, no.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.553
You're following your dreams.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.773
I'm very proud of you, Beta.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.557
I would like to help.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.734
Can I send you some money
while you're on the road?

10:47.777 --> 10:49.692
Isn't that what you call it?
On the road?

10:49.736 --> 10:50.780
- Yeah.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.696
But no,
I need to do this on my own.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.438
There's one thing
you could do for me.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.222
- Anything you need.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.399
- Look out for Ella for me.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.358
I don't want her
to feel too alone.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.708
- Oh, of course I will.

11:15.892 --> 11:19.330
- You guys are so annoying--
seriously!

11:19.374 --> 11:21.724
- No, guys, we have to start
over--he didn't say anything.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.812
- It doesn't matter!
- Yes it does.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.814
that's the point of the game.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.642
Say something!

11:27.643 --> 11:29.210
- Okay.
- It's always the same thing

11:29.253 --> 11:31.603
with her--it's like she's
the only one with problems.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.735
- Okay, okay, Shoshanna.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.345
It's fine to have
emotions in here.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.869
Obviously, that's
the whole point,

11:35.912 --> 11:39.307
but let's try to remember
intent versus impact, okay?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.744
Emily, what's going on?

11:41.788 --> 11:42.832
What's happening with you?

11:42.876 --> 11:44.791
- I just feel alone.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.227
- Why do you think
you feel alone?

11:46.270 --> 11:48.272
Come on,
back in the circle here.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.840
- Nobody cares
what I think.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.537
I don't matter
to anyone.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.756
- #truth.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.540
Shoshanna, please.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.847
You know,
it's okay to feel alone.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.457
We all feel alone
from time to time, right?

11:59.501 --> 12:00.720
Even when we aren't, right?

12:00.763 --> 12:02.634
Daniel, what about you?
How do you feel?

12:02.678 --> 12:05.550
- Yeah, I guess
I feel alone sometimes.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.291
And I...

12:07.335 --> 12:08.379
and I just...

12:09.467 --> 12:10.642
- Ooh, hold on.
Emily?

12:10.686 --> 12:11.643
You okay?

12:11.687 --> 12:14.211
- Something...

12:14.255 --> 12:16.213
something smells weird
in here.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.869
Like rotten eggs.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.916
- Okay, well, I'm--
I don't smell anything, so--

12:22.959 --> 12:24.308
- I smell it, too.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.658
Like,
really gross rotten eggs.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.312
- Um, you're all smelling it?

12:28.356 --> 12:30.314
Okay, uh, let's be safe.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.576
Everyone, come on,
let's get up.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.621
Up and out of the class.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.493
We will go
to a less stinky locale.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.147
Come on, Emily, you'll be okay.
Come on.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.238
All right, everybody down.
Yep, you know where to go.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.239
- Something wrong?

12:42.283 --> 12:43.719
- Um, maybe, yeah.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.548
Can you get maintenance?
We may have a gas leak.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.771
- Great news
for Renée Hamrick.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.642
- Oh, the board approved
visiting nurses?

12:53.685 --> 12:54.948
- Not yet,
not by a long shot.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.732
But, once they approve
my new candidate,

12:56.776 --> 12:57.733
I am confident they will.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.169
- That's fantastic.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.389
Who'd you, uh, sucker into
signing up for that?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.697
No, no.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.351
- Yeah.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.484
Just hear me out,

13:09.527 --> 13:10.702
because I need
an ally on the board,

13:10.746 --> 13:12.269
one of us, someone who can
make sure that

13:12.313 --> 13:14.576
when programs like the Visiting
Nurse's Agency come up,

13:14.619 --> 13:16.708
Brantley can't just--
brush 'em aside.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.233
- What time are the meetings?
- 10:30 on Wednesday.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.539
- Look, Max, I'd love to help,

13:21.583 --> 13:23.672
but the reason that the board
meets at 10:30 every Wednesday

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
is because
they don't have other jobs.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.544
I have surgery.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.850
- It would suck
to miss surgery,

13:27.894 --> 13:30.374
but, it could mean that
the next Renée Hamrick

13:30.418 --> 13:32.855
wouldn't need
additional surgery at all.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.726
So, think about it.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.206
Come on buddy,
what do you say?

13:36.250 --> 13:38.861
Me and you,
shaking things up.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.734
- All right, I'm in.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.519
- Yes, yes!
Thank you.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.304
- Dr. Reynolds?
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.479
- No.
- No?

13:48.523 --> 13:49.698
- $4.75.
- Keep it.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.395
- Oh, thank you.
- No, don't thank her.

13:51.439 --> 13:52.570
she's undermining elections.

13:52.614 --> 13:53.876
- No one's undermining
anything, Max.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.964
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.226
- I'm giving you reality,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.402
a thankless task
which appears to be my lot.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.448
- Dr. Reynolds is accomplished.

14:00.491 --> 14:03.538
He is dynamic, he knows
this hospital inside and out.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.322
- Can Dr. Reynolds raise
seven figures?

14:05.366 --> 14:06.367
No.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.759
Can he donate it himself?
No.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.848
Ergo, he's out.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.327
Money is how programs

14:10.371 --> 14:12.982
like the Visiting Nurse's
Program gets funded.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.679
If you want to play this game,

14:14.723 --> 14:17.334
bring me a candidate
the board can actually use.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.727
- Like another rich sycophant?

14:18.770 --> 14:21.556
- Like a CEO, a hedge fund
manager, or a celebrity.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.601
Better yet, all three.

14:23.645 --> 14:24.602
Happy hunting!

14:27.954 --> 14:30.782
- Oh, oh.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.437
- Okay, um...

14:33.481 --> 14:34.612
- Is Emily gonna be okay?

14:34.656 --> 14:36.527
- I'm handling it, Daniel.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.007
- You didn't exactly
answer the question.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.530
- Okay, you know what?
That's enough.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.749
Head to the classroom,
everybody.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.577
Thank you, I'll be there
in a second.

14:42.620 --> 14:43.621
Thank you.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.406
Here, yeah, come on.
Take a seat.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.280
Not feeling any better, huh?

14:50.324 --> 14:53.283
- My head still hurts
and I'm seeing spots.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.850
- Yeah, you know, natural gas,

14:54.894 --> 14:56.634
it can deprive
our body of oxygen

14:56.678 --> 14:58.810
and it causes all these
nasty little symptoms.

14:58.854 --> 15:00.334
It's called hypoxia.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.466
- No gas leak.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.772
- I'm sorry, what?

15:03.815 --> 15:05.469
No gas leak?
Um, hang on.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.949
Just keep breathing,
okay kiddo?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.559
What are you talking about?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.431
Emily is literally retching
her guts up on the floor.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.086
- Building services checked
the entire floor twice.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.832
- All right, page Kapoor.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.704
Thank you.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.706
- I don't want any trouble.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.316
- I understand that,
Mr. Martinelli,

15:26.360 --> 15:27.796
but we need you to tell us

15:27.839 --> 15:29.493
what you've seen
at your construction site.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.756
- Any old signs of labels
talking about cobalt,

15:31.800 --> 15:32.975
or other heavy metals?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.324
- No, nothing like that.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.760
- What about old insulation?

15:35.804 --> 15:37.371
- They're running
a clean shop, I swear,

15:37.414 --> 15:38.720
and they're square by me,

15:38.763 --> 15:40.591
especially how they treated me
since my accident.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.766
- What accident?

15:41.810 --> 15:43.855
- I was welding early on
on the joists,

15:43.899 --> 15:45.988
fell 10 feet
and shattered my hip.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.816
- Gosh, you're lucky
that was all.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.861
- And I was out a while.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.690
But the foreman,
after my hip replacement,

15:52.734 --> 15:53.865
put me on site hauling.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.738
He didn't have to do that.

15:56.781 --> 16:00.002
- Um, what do they have
you doing as a site hauler?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.569
- Driving the trash away.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.963
It's the cushiest job
I've ever had for the money.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.835
- Mr. Martinelli, are you okay
if we check something?

16:08.402 --> 16:09.359
- With that?

16:09.403 --> 16:10.404
- All you're gonna feel

16:10.447 --> 16:12.623
is a slight pinch
and some pressure.

16:28.030 --> 16:32.034
- Bloom, that's not blood.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.172
- What the hell?

16:39.215 --> 16:40.521
- Mr. Martinelli,

16:40.564 --> 16:43.611
you're being poisoned
by your artificial hip.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.961
- Emily's symptoms could be
caused by any number of things.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.615
I need to order
some further tests.

16:47.658 --> 16:48.920
- Oh, come on,
don't give me that.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.748
Your beautiful mind
already has a diagnosis.

16:50.792 --> 16:51.923
- No.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.013
I have a hypothesis.

16:54.056 --> 16:57.451
I suspect Emily is suffering
from a complex migraine.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.105
- A complex migraine?
- Iggy!

16:59.148 --> 17:00.976
Come quick,
something's wrong.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.977
- What?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.200
- Oh, whoa.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.031
You might need to revise
that hypothesis.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.296
- So, Renée Hamrick is here

17:16.339 --> 17:17.514
for an I&D
in the primary closure

17:17.558 --> 17:19.299
of her left leg's
saphenous vein graft site,

17:19.342 --> 17:21.257
and the position
looks good to me.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.824
We're ready to proceed.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.304
- Okay.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.609
- Alicia, go ahead and start
the general anesthetic.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.090
And for you,
I've got some good news.

17:28.134 --> 17:32.877
- Usually you wait till
after the surgery to say that.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.228
- I was just appointed
to the hospital board.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.882
And for my first act in office,
I intend to make sure

17:37.926 --> 17:40.015
you have someone
to check on you post-op--

17:40.059 --> 17:41.147
free of charge.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.322
- You can do that?

17:42.365 --> 17:43.888
- Oh, absolutely.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.194
See you when you wake up.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.196
- Dr. Reynolds!

17:49.198 --> 17:51.244
- I'm in the middle
of something.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.854
- Okay,
I have some bad news,

17:52.897 --> 17:54.247
so I'm just gonna say it really
fast: you're not on the board.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.118
- What?
Well, who'd you get?

17:56.162 --> 17:57.293
- No one.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.990
They just, you know,
didn't want you.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.472
Max, I just promised this woman

18:02.516 --> 18:05.171
that we would look after her
this time around.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.433
- And we're gonna
keep that promise.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.174
- How, exactly?

18:08.217 --> 18:10.393
I think I know.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.571
- Do you know how hard
the FDA makes it

18:14.615 --> 18:16.530
to answer one simple question?

18:16.573 --> 18:17.879
- What's the question?

18:17.922 --> 18:19.533
- If we put this hip
into someone's body,

18:19.576 --> 18:20.882
will it kill them?

18:20.925 --> 18:22.449
- Is that a real question?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.973
- The FDA stopped approving
metal-on-metal hips in 2016

18:25.016 --> 18:26.540
due to higher risks,
but how does that help

18:26.583 --> 18:30.283
the 3,000 patients that we gave
these hips to before 2016?

18:30.326 --> 18:31.458
- I am so glad you asked that,

18:31.501 --> 18:33.286
because that is
exactly the kind of issue

18:33.329 --> 18:34.548
that you are gonna be solving

18:34.591 --> 18:37.420
when you are on the board
of New Amsterdam.

18:37.464 --> 18:38.682
- On the board?

18:38.726 --> 18:40.293
- You're my first choice.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.425
You don't want Dr. Sharpe,
you want Dr. Helen.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.427
- Yes, that is true,
Brantley needs a celebrity.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.559
- Max,
when you first got here,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.213
you asked me to scale down
on publicity

18:47.256 --> 18:48.997
and scale up on medicine,

18:49.040 --> 18:50.999
which gave me purpose,
a renewed sense of self,

18:51.042 --> 18:53.262
something I could really use
right about now.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.481
- I know, but I really need

18:54.524 --> 18:56.483
one of us on the board
to make a difference,

18:56.526 --> 18:58.137
someone who
represents our views,

18:58.180 --> 18:59.399
and Brantley already
nixed Reynolds.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.488
- Oh, gosh, I thought
I was your first choice.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.403
- First in my...heart.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.406
- Oh Max, I would love
to help you and this hospital,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.408
but Brantley
will never approve me,

19:08.451 --> 19:09.887
celebrity or not,

19:09.931 --> 19:12.151
because effective chairmen
only approve board members

19:12.194 --> 19:13.282
that they agree with,

19:13.326 --> 19:15.371
and that's most definitely
not one of us.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.506
- Okay.

19:26.513 --> 19:27.601
- Dr. Goodwin.
- Whoa.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.255
It's not a covert operation,
Todd.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.778
- You need anything?

19:30.821 --> 19:32.649
- Nope, I'm all good,
and by all good I mean all bad,

19:32.693 --> 19:34.216
but in your free time,

19:34.260 --> 19:36.740
feel free to run some errands
or stop by the VA.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.438
- Unless I have
six weeks of free time,

19:38.481 --> 19:40.135
I won't be able to deal
with the wait at the VA.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.702
- Oh, well, let me make a call.
I'll get you in.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.660
- Nope, thank you--I don't
want any special treatment.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.445
It's what you get
with socialized medicine.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.316
- Oh, and you're not
a fan of socialized medicine.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.318
- It's un-American.
- It's un-American?

19:49.362 --> 19:53.017
What could be more American
than helping people?

19:53.061 --> 19:55.019
- A system
that embraces competition

19:55.063 --> 19:57.544
rather than relying on
a captive patient population.

19:57.587 --> 20:00.155
- We are standing
in a public hospital,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.417
and as the guy
who runs this place

20:01.461 --> 20:02.853
chock full of
socialized medicine,

20:02.897 --> 20:06.292
let me assure you, Todd,
we're doing a good thing here.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.642
- But in a socialized market,
there's no incentive

20:08.685 --> 20:10.296
for hospitals
to provide better care.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.211
- This hospital
has 1,000 beds,

20:12.254 --> 20:14.648
sees over 100,000 emergency
room visits every year.

20:14.691 --> 20:15.779
We don't--
- Max!

20:15.823 --> 20:18.652
Max! Hey, hi!
We, uh--hi.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.655
So, we feel obliged to tell you
that we may have an outbreak

20:21.698 --> 20:23.352
of Legionnaire's disease
in the hospital.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.788
But, uh, it's cool.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.399
We have it
totally under control.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.400
- Uh, we don't.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.271
Not yet, but very soon.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.272
- Yeah, it's, like,
old water systems,

20:30.316 --> 20:31.578
faulty AC units, you know.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.319
It was only a matter of time.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.537
- Good, got it?

20:34.581 --> 20:36.104
Okay.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.107
- You were saying?
About this hospital?

20:41.370 --> 20:44.330
- Okay, this plasmapheresis
machine will filter your blood

20:44.373 --> 20:46.506
and it'll help save
your remaining kidney function.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.725
- How is this
even happening?

20:48.769 --> 20:52.076
- The ball joint and the socket
of your artificial hip

20:52.120 --> 20:53.469
are made of a cobalt alloy.

20:53.513 --> 20:55.166
The metal parts
are rubbing against each other

20:55.210 --> 20:56.429
and the friction is causing

20:56.472 --> 20:58.648
the cobalt to flake off
into your bloodstream.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.824
- How do you stop it?

21:03.392 --> 21:06.134
- We are, uh, going to need
to replace your hip, Vince.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.223
- Ah, no.

21:10.138 --> 21:12.662
And how do we know
this won't just happen again?

21:12.706 --> 21:14.316
- Wedlow Medical,
the manufacturer,

21:14.360 --> 21:15.491
claims to have
fixed the problem

21:15.535 --> 21:16.623
with their newer models.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.320
- Claims to have fixed it?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.104
This is my body!

21:20.148 --> 21:21.628
Who's gonna pay
for the surgery?

21:21.671 --> 21:22.846
Or the time I'm out of work?

21:22.890 --> 21:24.500
It took eight weeks last time.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.763
You think my worker's comp
is gonna cover this again?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.287
No way.
- Vince--

21:28.330 --> 21:30.419
- No, this'll bankrupt me.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.421
- Listen to me,
Mr. Martinelli.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.466
That is not gonna happen,

21:33.509 --> 21:34.728
I promise you
I'll make sure of it.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.252
- And then who the hell
is gonna pay?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.863
- They are.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.738
- The antibiotics
aren't working.

21:44.781 --> 21:47.088
Symptoms
are just getting worse.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.612
- For which patient?
- For all of them.

21:49.656 --> 21:51.266
- Fevers are all over 100,

21:51.310 --> 21:52.746
Daniel's vomiting
has increased

21:52.789 --> 21:54.400
and Shoshanna's
shortness of breath--

21:54.443 --> 21:56.402
- Um, where is Shoshanna?

22:06.455 --> 22:08.675
Shoshanna,
what are you doing here?

22:08.718 --> 22:10.764
- "Low stimulus room."

22:10.807 --> 22:12.809
- Okay.
- I couldn't take any more

22:12.853 --> 22:16.160
of the crying and the puking
and "Will Emily be okay?"

22:16.204 --> 22:17.248
- How are you feeling?

22:17.292 --> 22:19.338
- Fine.
- Fine?

22:20.817 --> 22:22.210
- May I?

22:24.691 --> 22:25.648
Breathe, please.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.478
- Once more.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.395
- No bronchial constriction.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.657
Any nausea?

22:34.701 --> 22:35.658
- No.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.401
- Normal.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.185
- Hey, Shoshanna.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.665
How long have you
been in here?

22:42.709 --> 22:45.407
- Not long, I just needed
someplace quiet to journal.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.149
- How come
she is the only one better?

22:48.192 --> 22:50.717
- You keep journaling, okay?

22:56.200 --> 22:58.420
- Iggy, this is hardly
any time for stress eating.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.465
- What?

22:59.508 --> 23:00.857
No, I'm not stress eating,
Vijay.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.468
I think I know
how I can fix this.

23:02.511 --> 23:03.512
- How?

23:06.385 --> 23:07.864
- With these.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.087
- You really think
this is gonna work?

23:13.130 --> 23:15.219
- Well, you know what they say
about a spoonful of sugar.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.178
- Okay.
- Yeah.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.223
You have something called MPI,

23:19.267 --> 23:21.791
but this
will make you feel better.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.098
- When?
- Almost instantaneously.

23:24.141 --> 23:27.797
- ♪ I do declare you're gonna
miss your candyman, yeah ♪

23:27.841 --> 23:29.625
- Is this candy?
- Nope, it's medicine.

23:29.669 --> 23:30.626
Fast-acting.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.627
- Just one pill?

23:31.671 --> 23:32.628
- Just one pill.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.282
- Can I chew it?
- No.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.893
- ♪ I do declare you're gonna
miss your candyman, yeah ♪

23:36.937 --> 23:38.286
♪ I'm keeping you
safe and warm ♪

23:38.329 --> 23:39.330
Swallow.
- ♪ Yeah, baby

23:39.374 --> 23:41.681
♪ Keeping you out of harm

23:44.727 --> 23:46.773
- Are you sure
this isn't candy?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.209
- Yes.

23:48.252 --> 23:50.690
- ♪ Yeah, baby,
keepin' you out of harm ♪

23:50.733 --> 23:52.866
♪ Where you gonna go

23:56.870 --> 23:59.568
- Should I take one, too?
I could've been exposed.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.092
- No, no, no,
you're too old to contract it.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.530
- Too old?

24:04.573 --> 24:08.011
- Yes, MPI stands for
"Mass Psychogenic Illness,"

24:08.055 --> 24:09.883
also known as Collective
Obsessional Behavior,

24:09.926 --> 24:11.711
also known as...

24:11.754 --> 24:13.060
- Mass hysteria?

24:13.103 --> 24:14.061
- Bingo.

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
Yes, MPI tends to crop up

24:15.671 --> 24:17.804
in isolated, pressurized
groups of young people,

24:17.847 --> 24:19.893
much like
fancy boarding schools...

24:19.936 --> 24:21.155
our psych ward.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.156
- Or Salem.

24:22.199 --> 24:23.723
- Yeah, and once
it gets rolling,

24:23.766 --> 24:25.028
it transmits by line-of-sight,

24:25.072 --> 24:26.421
much like an actual
physical virus.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.076
That's why Shoshanna improved
once she was isolated.

24:29.119 --> 24:32.340
- So wait, after all this,
no one was actually sick?

24:32.383 --> 24:33.820
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.343
And the symptoms are about
as real as they get, clearly.

24:35.386 --> 24:38.302
But, um, a psychological
problem requires...

24:38.346 --> 24:39.913
a psychological cure.

24:41.305 --> 24:44.134
Preferably cherry-flavored.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.319
- Hi, uh--oh, sorry.
You okay?

24:55.363 --> 24:57.104
- I'm working on it.

24:57.147 --> 24:58.671
- Good, 'cause I'm in
a bit of a pickle.

24:58.714 --> 25:02.631
Um, so, I need help filling
an extra seat on the board.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.328
- Oh, I'm in.
Oh, thank you.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.504
You know what?

25:05.547 --> 25:07.114
The busier I am,
the less pain I feel.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.942
- Actually,
I was kind of hoping

25:08.985 --> 25:11.814
to fill it with your mother.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.120
- My mother?

25:13.163 --> 25:15.601
- Yeah, okay, hear me out.
You said that she runs

25:15.644 --> 25:17.254
in wealthy socialite crowds,
right?

25:17.298 --> 25:18.647
Which is great,

25:18.691 --> 25:20.301
because Brantley will assume
that she is one of them.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.347
But here is where
the plan gets really good--

25:23.391 --> 25:25.611
she will secretly
be working for us, right?

25:25.654 --> 25:26.829
Our man on the inside.

25:26.873 --> 25:29.092
You can tell her
how to vote and what to back

25:29.136 --> 25:30.354
and what to bring
to the floor--

25:30.398 --> 25:32.400
- Like a puppet?

25:32.443 --> 25:34.010
- Yeah,
more like a Trojan Horse,

25:34.054 --> 25:35.011
but for the good guys.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.447
- Max.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.319
She can't be trusted.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.581
- Well, that's okay, I mean,

25:39.625 --> 25:40.800
even if she doesn't go with us
every time, it--

25:40.843 --> 25:42.802
- No. No, I mean
she can't be trusted

25:42.845 --> 25:44.978
to show up, anywhere.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.457
Except for maybe
a hosted bar.

25:46.501 --> 25:48.808
And even if we programmed her,
she would still vote

25:48.851 --> 25:51.811
for whoever was doing
the shaking and the pouring.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.813
- Got it.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.205
I didn't know that, sorry.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.380
- No, no, don't be.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.643
No, it helps to be reminded

25:57.686 --> 26:00.167
I am genetically
predisposed to it.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.256
Guess you're gonna
have to go with plan B.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.693
- Yeah, plan B failed...

26:04.737 --> 26:06.913
several plans ago.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.122
- Paging Dr. Goodwin.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.870
- Page me
as soon as she wakes up.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.045
- Will do.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.180
- Evie.
- Hey babe, how's it going?

26:57.224 --> 26:59.748
- Well, I, uh,
just had to redo a surgery

26:59.792 --> 27:00.967
because our health care system

27:01.010 --> 27:03.230
only goes halfway
when it matters.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.885
- That sounds frustrating.
- Oh, well, it is.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.930
But I'll be all right,
you know why?

27:07.974 --> 27:11.107
Because you are coming home
to me tomorrow.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.023
Evie?

27:15.329 --> 27:18.332
- Okay, so don't freak out,
this is good news.

27:18.375 --> 27:21.248
HHC is so impressed
by my work,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.206
they've asked me to stay here
for two more weeks.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.341
- Two more weeks?

27:27.384 --> 27:30.474
- I know, but I have to
see this job through.

27:30.518 --> 27:35.088
What's the point of only going
halfway when it matters, right?

27:37.481 --> 27:39.266
I gotta go.

27:39.309 --> 27:40.310
- Floyd, wait, I--

27:49.015 --> 27:51.452
- Vijay?
- Ella?

27:51.495 --> 27:53.149
- Have you seen Rohan?

27:53.193 --> 27:55.238
He was supposed to meet me here
two hours ago.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.631
- Yes, I saw him.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.765
He came to say good-bye
before he left on the tour.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.810
- What tour?

28:01.854 --> 28:06.293
- Um, his tour on the--
with the band?

28:06.336 --> 28:07.990
- Oh, my God.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.557
For the last two hours

28:09.600 --> 28:12.212
I've been trying to convince
myself this wasn't happening.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.258
I should've known
he couldn't handle it.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.565
But to disappear
like a coward?

28:17.608 --> 28:19.306
- I don't understand.

28:19.349 --> 28:22.178
- There's no tour, Vijay.
He lied.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.266
He bailed.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.356
- W-why would he do that?

28:29.577 --> 28:31.797
- I'm pregnant.

28:42.677 --> 28:45.114
- Dr. Kapoor, Dr. Kapoor!

28:47.551 --> 28:49.379
- Get me Ativan, now!

28:51.512 --> 28:52.948
- 1 mil Ativan.

28:52.992 --> 28:53.949
- I thought everyone
was getting better.

28:53.993 --> 28:54.994
- They were.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.387
Everyone else is,
just--Emily...

28:57.431 --> 28:59.999
- 60 lpm, high flow 02.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.218
- Pulse ox 95.
- What's wrong with her?

29:02.262 --> 29:04.307
- I don't know!

29:04.351 --> 29:06.614
- She's stabilizing.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.312
I-I'm sorry.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.459
- Because you personally
brought this to our attention,

29:25.502 --> 29:27.374
Wedlow Medical is willing
to cover the cost

29:27.417 --> 29:30.246
of Mr. Martinelli's
new hip replacement.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.379
- And?

29:32.422 --> 29:33.772
- We'll also cover

29:33.815 --> 29:38.864
Mr. Martinelli's rehabilitation
and lost wages.

29:38.907 --> 29:41.562
- Yeah, no, that's not
gonna work for us.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.129
Because I discovered

29:43.172 --> 29:45.958
that when the FDA banned
metal-on-metal hips,

29:46.001 --> 29:50.179
your company simply coated
those defective hips.

29:50.223 --> 29:55.663
Mr. Martinelli would like
your 100% ceramic hip.

29:55.706 --> 29:58.884
- The one that won't poison me.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.320
- Those are triple the cost.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.931
- Oh, I wasn't done.
We'd also like Wedlow Medical

30:02.975 --> 30:05.629
to provide the ceramic hip
free of charge

30:05.673 --> 30:07.457
to any new patient

30:07.501 --> 30:11.244
who suffers a malfunction
of your coated devices.

30:11.287 --> 30:14.595
- Dr. Sharpe, we don't have to
offer your patients anything.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.902
We're in full compliance
with the FDA, in fact,

30:16.945 --> 30:19.078
we only took this little
meeting because, frankly,

30:19.121 --> 30:21.080
we're big fans of Dr. Helen.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.000
Brilliant.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.698
Then Dr. Helen will go on TV
and broadcast to the world

30:30.741 --> 30:32.700
how Wedlow Medical's
poorly designed products

30:32.743 --> 30:34.354
harm patients.

30:36.660 --> 30:41.404
And perhaps I'll bring this
to drive my point home.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.581
It's joint fluid.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.323
We found it inside
Mr. Martinelli's body.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.283
- You do that,
and we'll crush you

30:50.326 --> 30:51.762
with so many defamation suits,

30:51.806 --> 30:54.461
you'll never
practice medicine again.

30:54.504 --> 30:57.681
- I'd like to see you try.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.248
- They'll destroy you.

30:59.292 --> 31:02.121
They have bottomless pockets
and a fleet of lawyers and

31:02.164 --> 31:04.645
they will destroy everything
that you have ever worked for.

31:04.688 --> 31:07.300
- They only see me as
Dr. Helen, a TV personality,

31:07.343 --> 31:09.258
so I intend to put
that personality to good use.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.520
- Yeah, and what about
Dr. Sharpe?

31:10.564 --> 31:12.305
- She is out
fighting for her patients,

31:12.348 --> 31:14.263
something that you do
every single day, and yet,

31:14.307 --> 31:15.482
you're asking me
to pull my punches.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.613
Why would you do that?

31:16.657 --> 31:18.050
- Because this will
end your career,

31:18.093 --> 31:21.618
and I can't do this
without you.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.755
I'm not...

31:27.798 --> 31:29.409
fully...

31:29.452 --> 31:31.193
here.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.983
Part of me is still...

31:38.026 --> 31:40.289
on that ambulance.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.773
- You push me away,

31:45.816 --> 31:48.602
and you expect me
to understand.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.734
And then you need me?

31:50.778 --> 31:52.649
And you use your feelings
as leverage.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.738
- You think I'm using Georgia
to manipulate you?

31:54.782 --> 31:56.001
- I don't what you're doing

31:56.044 --> 31:57.002
because you won't ever
talk to me.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.046
- I can't talk to you.
- Why?

31:58.090 --> 32:02.050
- Because I'm trying
to spare you.

32:02.094 --> 32:05.053
I don't want you to feel...

32:05.097 --> 32:07.186
this.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.318
I don't want you
to experience...

32:09.362 --> 32:12.539
this...

32:14.236 --> 32:17.413
and it's not fair.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.763
I know.

32:19.807 --> 32:22.201
- None of this is fair.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.246
We can just toss "fair"
out the window.

32:27.249 --> 32:31.210
Max, when you need me,
I am here for you.

32:34.169 --> 32:37.085
For all of it.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.088
But not at the expense
of my patient.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.617
- As awful as it sounds,
in regards to

32:47.661 --> 32:49.228
some of the larger
medical device companies,

32:49.271 --> 32:51.708
we've just become guinea pigs
for their inferior products.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.319
- It's not as if
it's a microwave

32:53.362 --> 32:54.929
that you can return
or get recalled.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.757
- Exactly.
We're talking about products

32:56.800 --> 32:59.455
that are surgically implanted
into your body.

32:59.499 --> 33:03.851
In your spine,
your heart, the hip.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.984
And if these products fail,
you get sick.

33:06.027 --> 33:09.422
Or worse, you die.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.685
I have a brave,
hardworking patient

33:11.728 --> 33:13.426
whose life has been
turned upside down

33:13.469 --> 33:14.731
by one of these products.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.256
The time has come
to make a stand.

33:17.299 --> 33:18.822
- When we come back,

33:18.866 --> 33:22.522
Dr. Helen will reveal which
company to avoid and why.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.569
- And, we're out!

33:46.763 --> 33:49.723
- And we're back in 3, 2...

33:49.766 --> 33:52.204
- Welcome back
to "The Night Shift".

33:52.247 --> 33:54.902
I'm here with Dr. Helen,
who has come to warn us

33:54.945 --> 33:57.774
about a company that harmed
one of her patients.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.342
Dr. Helen?

34:06.740 --> 34:08.437
- I'm...

34:08.481 --> 34:10.700
actually not here

34:10.744 --> 34:14.226
to shame any one
particular company,

34:14.269 --> 34:18.752
because in truth, they're all
in compliance with the FDA,

34:18.795 --> 34:20.928
and that's where
the real fault lies.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.017
- So you're taking on
the FDA?

34:23.061 --> 34:25.715
- It appears that way,
doesn't it?

34:25.759 --> 34:29.676
The FDA need to enact real
regulations on medical devices

34:29.719 --> 34:32.679
that protect patients,
not corporate profit.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.550
We need clinical trials

34:34.594 --> 34:36.683
before implanting heavy metals
into our body.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.512
We need oversight.
We deserve that much.

34:39.555 --> 34:42.776
- So what can our viewers
at home--what can they do?

34:42.819 --> 34:45.474
- Call your representatives,
demand to be heard.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.867
If we want change,

34:46.910 --> 34:48.782
then we have to be
the ones to initiate it.

35:11.892 --> 35:14.024
- Dr. Bloom,
we don't have a session today.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.417
- We do.

35:15.461 --> 35:16.984
For the next seven minutes.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.946
- Remember to sit still,
Emily.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.524
Dr. Kapoor,
the results are up.

35:40.355 --> 35:43.576
- You have what is called
a meningioma.

35:43.619 --> 35:46.753
A tumor on the lining
of your brain.

35:46.796 --> 35:49.364
It's been causing
all your symptoms.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.585
- Yeah, that sounds a lot worse
than it actually is.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.326
- Meningiomas
are usually benign.

35:54.369 --> 35:57.459
Once we remove them, you
will be back to your old self.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.940
- Did everybody have one
of these tumors, too?

35:59.983 --> 36:01.071
- No, they didn't.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.682
They saw you getting sick

36:02.725 --> 36:05.598
and then they believed
that they were sick, too.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.861
- So I did this to them?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.471
- No.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.125
Emily, you didn't do anything.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.520
They saw you and
they were affected by you.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.870
You know what that means?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.524
- That they all hate me now?

36:18.567 --> 36:20.787
- No, it means that
you're not alone...

36:34.801 --> 36:36.585
That we're all connected.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.688
- Main hoon na.

36:52.732 --> 36:53.776
- What?

36:53.820 --> 36:54.777
- In Bollywood movies,

36:54.821 --> 36:57.606
they would say,
main hoon na.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.043
- Vijay, if you're here
to make excuses for your son,

37:00.087 --> 37:01.915
you should leave
before I lose it.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.222
- I went to Rohan's apartment,

37:04.265 --> 37:08.487
to his office,
called up his sponsor...

37:08.530 --> 37:11.490
I couldn't find him.
My son is gone.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.231
- Yeah, well...

37:13.274 --> 37:16.016
- When life overwhelms him,
he...

37:16.059 --> 37:18.453
he always runs away.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.977
But not me.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.980
I wish for you to know that.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.549
- Vijay?

37:31.161 --> 37:32.946
- Main hoon na?

37:32.989 --> 37:34.687
What does that mean?

37:38.865 --> 37:40.780
- "I'm there for you."

37:56.883 --> 37:58.276
-  It's time
for the board meeting.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.582
- Ugh, we promised we'd
help that woman and we failed.

38:00.626 --> 38:04.978
I don't have the votes for
the Visiting Nurse's Program.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.632
- Well...

38:06.675 --> 38:07.807
a nanny state program
like that

38:07.850 --> 38:09.548
probably wouldn't have
worked, anyway.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.682
- I get that we
all have different...

38:13.726 --> 38:14.988
political beliefs, Todd,

38:15.031 --> 38:17.947
but that woman needs help,
and she needs it now.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.253
- I understand that.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.211
And self-reliance is the key
to a good life,

38:21.255 --> 38:22.909
and it doesn't take
taxpayer money to achieve.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.519
- Okay, okay, what about this?

38:24.563 --> 38:27.827
What if instead of wagging your
finger or disagreeing with me,

38:27.870 --> 38:29.611
what about you help her?

38:29.655 --> 38:33.789
Give me a self-reliant solution
that helps Renée Hamrick.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.618
- Get her a dog.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.927
- Get her...a dog.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.885
- Adopt a dog for her.

38:42.929 --> 38:46.324
Then you hire a dog walker
to come by once a day.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.023
- To...check on her.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.721
- Twice, pick up and drop off.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.506
How much
was this nurse's agency

38:54.549 --> 38:55.507
gonna cost you per day?

38:55.550 --> 38:57.596
- Um, around $200.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.685
- I bet you can get
a dog walker for $20.

39:01.904 --> 39:04.342
- Todd...

39:04.385 --> 39:07.083
have you ever thought about
being on a board?

39:07.127 --> 39:10.913
A CEO, a celebrity,
or a hedge fund manager.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.088
That's what you said, right?

39:12.132 --> 39:14.700
That's what this board needs,
a leader.

39:14.743 --> 39:18.878
Uh, someone acclaimed
or someone rich.

39:18.921 --> 39:21.707
Sergeant Todd Benson
is a leader.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.230
He asked for loyalty
in a setting

39:23.273 --> 39:25.885
more intense than any
boardroom, and he got it.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.060
And--

39:27.103 --> 39:28.670
you don't get more acclaim
than a veteran

39:28.714 --> 39:31.151
with a Purple Heart and
a host of other decorations.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.674
- You left one out.

39:32.718 --> 39:35.068
I respect your service,
Sergeant, we all do,

39:35.111 --> 39:37.723
but the category
Max conveniently skipped

39:37.766 --> 39:39.638
is the most important one:
money.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.683
Having it, donating it,
raising it.

39:41.727 --> 39:44.077
That's what
a board member does.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.775
- Yeah,
that's why you need Todd.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.037
Todd did something today

39:48.081 --> 39:49.082
that most of you
would call impossible.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.389
He changed my mind.

39:51.432 --> 39:54.087
And he did it using the kind
of insight that you get

39:54.130 --> 39:58.265
when you spend your life
making more out of less.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.049
Economic diversity can lead

40:00.093 --> 40:03.618
to innovative solutions
to dollars and cents problems.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.707
Yes, money,
that's what boards do.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.274
That's why this board
needs someone

40:07.317 --> 40:10.320
who knows what it's like
to not have it.

40:10.364 --> 40:14.194
- How do we know he's not just
going to vote however you say?

40:14.237 --> 40:16.414
- Him?
No, he's gonna vote with you

40:16.457 --> 40:19.808
more than he votes with me.
We can barely agree on, um...

40:19.852 --> 40:21.419
literally anything.

40:21.462 --> 40:24.073
Yeah, but we do agree
on one thing,

40:24.117 --> 40:26.641
and that's that we both
want to help.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.775
He just helps in a way
that's less "one of us"

40:29.818 --> 40:31.124
and more like the people

40:31.167 --> 40:34.040
that New Amsterdam
is trying to serve.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.656
- Before we vote
on Lamont Hallstrom,

40:41.700 --> 40:43.353
resolve to nominate Todd Benson

40:43.397 --> 40:45.878
to the board of
New Amsterdam Hospital.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.141
Is there a second?

40:50.839 --> 40:54.974
The motion proceeds.
All in favor?

41:00.327 --> 41:01.894
The votes have it.

41:01.937 --> 41:05.071
Welcome to our newest board
member, Sergeant Todd Benson.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.727
- Congratulations.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.685
Oh, and the board
is an unpaid position,

41:10.729 --> 41:13.993
so I think in this case
we can make an exception.

41:14.036 --> 41:15.429
Salary equal
to what he's surrendering

41:15.473 --> 41:16.865
as my assistant seems fair.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.214
Can I get a...

41:18.258 --> 41:20.347
second?

41:23.132 --> 41:25.221
- There you go, yep.

41:26.962 --> 41:28.355
- Evie, hey look,

41:28.398 --> 41:30.400
before you say anything,
I've gotta apologize.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.751
I just, uh, I miss you.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.188
- I miss you, too.

41:36.363 --> 41:39.497
And I'm so lucky
to be marrying a man

41:39.540 --> 41:44.719
who is excited to plan
our wedding while I'm here.

41:45.981 --> 41:49.115
I just...

41:49.158 --> 41:51.770
I feel so far away...

41:51.813 --> 41:53.946
you know?

41:53.989 --> 41:57.079
- Well, there's gotta
be something we can do.

41:59.081 --> 42:01.040
One second.

42:01.083 --> 42:04.739
- ♪ But no matter
what you do ♪

42:04.783 --> 42:08.874
♪ Even pray to heaven above

42:08.917 --> 42:11.224
- Caterer needs a decision
by tomorrow.
