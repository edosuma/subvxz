01:30.716 --> 01:33.427
Dorothy, are you okay?

01:33.510 --> 01:37.055
Are you okay? It's nearly noon.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.224
It is?

01:41.643 --> 01:42.936
You don't look well.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.524
No, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I'll get dressed.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.568
No, no. You relax.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.236
It's Sunday.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.321
I just…

01:54.364 --> 01:55.991
I'm proud of you.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.243
You ventured out and guess what?

01:58.327 --> 02:00.954
Nothing bad happened.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.458
Things are finally starting to look up.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.798
"The green frogs danced
in the pond that night,

02:12.716 --> 02:16.136
while the black sheep cried
in the pale moonlight."

02:16.762 --> 02:19.515
That's the black sheep, not me.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.016
You think it's funny, huh?

02:24.937 --> 02:26.230
Come on.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.650
Okay. Okay.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.778
This is Sean.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.990
I'm flattered,
but it's just not a good time.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.116
Yeah.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.701
Okay.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.537
Right, you too.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.121
Okay. Thank you, bye.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.165
It's okay.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.876
Sean? Your son was literally shrieking.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.754
I was on, literally, for two seconds.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.382
-With whom?
-Just work stuff.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.758
What work stuff?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.928
Who's "Taylor Producer Lady"?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.889
She's from Gourmet Gauntlet.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.437
They want you to guest judge?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.399
This is huge.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.527
What?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.989
They want me to host the next season.
They're gonna bring it to Philly.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.658
Sean!

03:20.284 --> 03:21.785
This is huge!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.078
You said that already.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.790
Well, do you get how huge it is?
What is with all these secrets lately?

03:27.374 --> 03:29.126
I just didn't wanna worry you. That's--

03:29.209 --> 03:31.628
Why would I worry about your success?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.965
Well, I'm not gonna do it. For the family.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.260
Well, you have to do it.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.181
What, is this with the whole God thing?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.558
Nice, Dorothy.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.351
Leanne?

03:48.812 --> 03:50.647
Leanne!

03:51.356 --> 03:53.650
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.654
And can you grab the petunias by the gate?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.453
So anyway, can you believe
he wants to say no?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.914
Sean struggles with self-esteem.

04:07.456 --> 04:10.584
-He's always seemed confident to me.
-That's cute.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.127
He's faking it, darling.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.046
It's fine, I'm used to pushing him.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.850
Well, that should about do it.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.192
Right.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.277
What are you doing?

04:38.195 --> 04:40.822
You gotta tear it up a little,
or it won't grow.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.825
They're just like us,
prettiest after a little work.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.036
Plucking and shaving
and dieting and squats.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.668
I'll bet this new minister lady has him
convinced that ambition isn't virtuous.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.461
What new minister lady?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
He didn't tell you either. Interesting.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.592
Sean has been having an affair.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.511
With Jesus.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.557
No, I didn't know that.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.518
He's always been so suggestible.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.312
Well, I invited her to dinner tomorrow.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.648
Friends close, but enemies closer.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.316
But don't tell him I said that.

05:17.985 --> 05:18.986
Here.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.907
This is fun. Hanging out, telling secrets.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.868
Girl time.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.797
That doesn't look very safe.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.215
It'll do for now.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.303
So Dorothy told me about the job.
That's great.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.597
There is no job.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.975
I'm not gonna do it.
'Cause those things come with a cost.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.771
It'll be different this time.
I'll be here.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.817
That's very kind, Leanne.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.819
But pride comes before the fall.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.114
That doesn't sound like you.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.452
-Then why bother building bridges?
-No, it won't hold both of--

06:08.535 --> 06:10.913
What the fuck, Leanne?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.831
I'm so sorry.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.805
Trust me. This is scarier.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.517
Well, hopefully you'll get used to it.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.896
What, to my husband being
some closet altar boy?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.273
I picked the most progressive church.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.566
Still.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.322
Is Leanne being weird?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.408
-When is Leanne not being weird?
-Yeah.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.871
Be nice to Nancy when she comes to dinner.

06:53.539 --> 06:56.041
Me? I'm just a little lamb.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.876
Uh-uh, you're the wolf.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.797
Have you accepted that offer yet?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.007
Dorothy, will you drop it, please?

07:04.091 --> 07:06.468
What is going on with you?

07:07.135 --> 07:10.097
Random opportunities like this
don't just come along.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.808
You have to seize this with both hands.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.396
Don't let our son know you
as the guy who was too scared to try.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.482
Where's your hat?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.776
Where's your hat? Yes.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.319
How cute are we?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.489
-Very cute.
-You're coming.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.117
Yes.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.619
We need to keep practicing feeling safe.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.874
Spring has sprung. We don't wanna miss
all the gorgeous rebirth.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.958
I'm cold.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.920
You're crazy. The sun is out.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.841
Fine.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.636
Let's take a great
big breath of fresh air.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.354
I can literally hear you not breathing.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.407
Leanne.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.336
No, no.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.589
We know what you've done.
We know what you are.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.033
You're safe now. Act like it.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.115
-Is she home?
-Who?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.366
Leanne.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.285
No.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.123
Can you check?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.125
No, I cannot check.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.835
And you're on private property.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.312
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.900
You look different. Your hair?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.651
Yes. Curls.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.528
No Veera?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.989
-No Veera.
-Why?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.491
Who knows. I'm not a damn mind reader.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.578
Here's some no-point bubbles for tonight.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.496
Is the God lady here?

10:21.580 --> 10:24.333
No. But I look forward to meeting her.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.293
Is that jealousy?

10:27.503 --> 10:29.755
Is she stepping on your holy turf?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.757
Tonight is gonna be fun.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.516
I must do everything myself.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.747
What are you doing?

11:03.830 --> 11:06.208
I'm not eating. I'm priming.

11:09.294 --> 11:13.465
Text from "Taylor Producer Lady."
That sounds shady as fuck.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.342
You and your sister. Boundaries.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.927
Yeah. Overrated.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.388
You can't do this.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.350
-Who told you?
-Who do you think?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.311
She wants me to convince you
to climb every fucking mountain.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.859
Sean. No.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.777
I'm not gonna do it!

11:34.528 --> 11:36.864
-But why not?
-What do you mean, "Why not?"

11:36.947 --> 11:39.074
She can't even fucking remember
the first time.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.952
This is gonna totally wake her up
from her Sleeping Beauty routine.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.871
Psych fucking 101.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.455
I wish we could just move on.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.750
Yeah. "I wish I was a little bit taller,
I wish I was a baller."

11:49.626 --> 11:51.170
Just keep a lid on this, okay?

11:55.132 --> 11:56.466
Where's Dorothy anyway?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.216
Oh, my God.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.046
Hello.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.758
Hello?

13:25.389 --> 13:27.808
Hi, I'm Nancy.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.769
Sean's minister from Liberty Unitarian.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.689
You must be Leanne.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.107
Who told you that?

13:35.190 --> 13:36.275
Sean did.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.820
Excuse my getup.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.614
I came from service,
and it doubles as winter-wear.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.058
Are they in the kitchen?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.645
You should wait in here with me.

14:14.938 --> 14:15.939
Okay.

14:22.196 --> 14:23.989
Nancy, when did you get here?

14:24.072 --> 14:25.490
Why didn't you come and get us?

14:26.116 --> 14:28.952
-You were busy.
-It's fine. I was early.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.417
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.838
Nancy. Welcome to our home.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.341
Leanne, may I have a word
with you for a sec?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.636
You two catch up. We'll be right back.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.641
What's going on?

14:50.724 --> 14:51.767
What do you mean?

14:51.850 --> 14:54.811
I saw on the security playback.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.439
Why didn't you tell us?

14:58.190 --> 15:02.069
-You've been watching me?
-No. Well, yes, this once.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.322
I just didn't want you to worry.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.243
Why is everyone so worried
about me worrying?

15:09.326 --> 15:11.161
It's my job to worry.

15:12.037 --> 15:15.082
I saw people chase you through our house.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.459
Did they hurt you?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.254
Were they with the cult?

15:22.548 --> 15:23.799
Oh, my God.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.385
This is insanity.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.887
They are insane. It has been months.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.056
Is that homeless boy one of them?

15:31.139 --> 15:33.517
And what if you'd had Jericho with you?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.812
-It's okay, Dorothy.
-It is not okay.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.397
You're just in shock.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.899
And, oh, my God,
I made you go to the park where--

15:43.277 --> 15:45.571
You must be terrified, you poor thing.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.655
No.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.741
I'm not scared anymore.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.203
I'm just not ready yet.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.082
Not ready for what?

15:59.585 --> 16:02.504
You left me out here
with Sean and the God lady by myself.

16:02.588 --> 16:03.964
Some help, please?

16:04.047 --> 16:05.674
Oh, God.

16:12.014 --> 16:15.225
The fish is an important symbol
of fertility and transformation

16:15.309 --> 16:17.561
for many people throughout time.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.522
Tonight, I have prepared
several fish dishes for us to explore.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.691
More stripped down than my usual fare.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.778
No molecular gastronomy.
No unusual flavor pairings.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.449
Just fish in traditional styles.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.285
Simple, clean, and to the point.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.078
Much like this speech.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.499
This first dish is Hikarimono.
It means luminous body.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.543
Nancy, why don't you take the first bite?

16:42.336 --> 16:44.463
I'm vegan. I thought you knew.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.466
Well, that's okay. That's great.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.760
Let me-- I'm gonna whip you up
something right now.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.053
I'll be right back.

16:54.181 --> 16:58.435
So, Nancy, I have been reading
all about Unitarian Universalism.

16:58.519 --> 17:00.938
I am you, you. You are you, you.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.232
We are you, you. Great, great, great.

17:03.315 --> 17:06.234
We're looking for the truth.
Uh-huh, all the time.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.154
Wow. Retro. I like it.

17:09.238 --> 17:11.406
Just can't get enough
of anything "you, you."

17:11.906 --> 17:14.201
I think that's enough of "you, you."

17:14.284 --> 17:16.203
Julian. Atheist. Nihilist.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.748
Beliefs are grounding, whatever they are.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.583
Oh, my God. I didn't introduce you two.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.876
I'm so sorry.

17:25.087 --> 17:29.424
Nancy, do tell us your background.
Do you have a PhD in theology?

17:29.508 --> 17:31.426
I have a master's in divinity.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.179
A master's. So much quicker. Good for you.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.557
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.061
Dorothy has a master's
in WASP Linguistics.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.479
And you just got roasted.

18:17.598 --> 18:18.599
Okay.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.684
Wow. Stunning, Sean.

18:21.602 --> 18:23.145
Nancy, do you wanna say grace?

18:23.729 --> 18:26.231
No. I'm just a guest tonight.

18:26.315 --> 18:28.025
Please. We'd be so honored.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.109
Grace.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.446
Leanne, that is so rude.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.615
Sean, she's just joking.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.618
I'm so sorry, Nancy.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.370
I should apologize.
You won't even open my shitty wine.

18:40.454 --> 18:44.791
Is the Jersey Trader Joe's that bad,
or are you just a snob?

18:46.710 --> 18:48.754
You could not pay me to drink this.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.673
But you could pay me. Probably.

18:54.426 --> 18:55.969
-No, she did not.
-Right!

18:56.053 --> 18:58.138
Yes she did. In front of everyone.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.640
Bless.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.936
So, Susan's, like, 85 years old.
She heads up the choir,

19:04.019 --> 19:06.647
and she's hard of hearing
and has terrible flatulence.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.983
Just imagine her conducting
"This Little Light of Mine"

19:10.067 --> 19:11.610
and then all the while she's--

19:17.991 --> 19:19.618
You really have to know Susan.

19:20.661 --> 19:25.749
So, we have whole whitebait fish
with lime and cilantro and jalapeño aioli.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.252
I can't even look at yours.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.922
Crinkle cut's my favorite, actually.

19:33.507 --> 19:34.883
Why did you wake him?

19:34.967 --> 19:36.927
Now he's off his sleep schedule
for the whole week.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.554
I wanted him close to me.

19:41.515 --> 19:45.519
So, Nancy. What do you and Sean talk about
during, you know, confession?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.229
-Dorothy!
-What?

19:47.312 --> 19:48.981
I'm just making conversation.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.358
We don't do confession.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.986
I'm not into guilt.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.577
Do you want us to put up the heat?

20:01.660 --> 20:03.203
I'm fine. Thank you.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.706
Your arms are covered in goose bumps.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.627
So they are.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.802
So, Sean's now a famous TV host.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.639
I still haven't decided.

20:23.599 --> 20:26.018
"You miss 100%
of the shots you don't take."

20:26.518 --> 20:28.729
Yes! Thank you.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.315
Did a minister just quote Wayne Gretzky?

20:31.398 --> 20:33.734
Brent, our keyboardist,
is addicted to the show.

20:33.817 --> 20:37.112
He went through the roof
when Sean first started coming to service.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.076
Brent can quote every line
from your guest spot last season.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.914
Last season? What are you talking about?

20:49.041 --> 20:52.044
She has the worst memory. Especially when
she's a little bit jealous.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.713
She's forgotten my birthday three times.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.926
2011 shouldn't even count.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.222
Last fall was just a blur.

21:04.473 --> 21:05.849
Baby brain.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.855
He's hooked.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.733
Too bad he's not up to scale.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.194
Don't quit your day jobs.

21:17.778 --> 21:20.239
Maybe do quit yours, though.
Red wine with fish.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.783
What is this, 1995?

21:23.659 --> 21:25.786
The Grenache pairs perfectly
with the oily mackerel.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.205
-Oh, shit.
-Sean.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.207
Sorry.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.670
No, no. Please.

21:34.753 --> 21:37.172
You will return to Him.

21:44.721 --> 21:45.889
No!

21:53.397 --> 21:55.774
She must reunite--

22:22.426 --> 22:23.886
What do you want from me?

22:26.096 --> 22:27.639
I'm not like you.

22:28.724 --> 22:29.850
We know.

22:32.311 --> 22:35.564
You said no to Him. And you're still here.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.065
Aren't you with them?

22:38.734 --> 22:39.985
Not anymore.

22:45.699 --> 22:49.203
Okay, I surrender. That is hands-down
the worst meal I've ever served.

22:49.286 --> 22:52.789
So I don't have to eat this hair
in my tomato compote?

22:52.873 --> 22:53.957
-No.
-Oh, God.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.042
That's good.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.002
Mr. Turner's cooking isn't a joke.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.630
I'm refining Leanne's palate.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.426
We would be lost without her.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.680
She's spiritual too.

23:09.890 --> 23:10.933
Not anymore.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.560
That's new to me. Since when?

23:13.644 --> 23:15.395
Since I outgrew make-believe.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.814
You get one. We get one.

23:17.898 --> 23:20.651
Balance is restored and we all hurtle
toward certain destruction anyway.

23:22.611 --> 23:26.573
You're young and exploring.
That's exactly what you should be doing.

23:26.657 --> 23:28.033
Thank you for your permission.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.243
Leanne!

23:31.245 --> 23:32.371
It's okay.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.416
Well, my path wasn't
a straight line either.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.628
Maybe no one's is.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.507
But I think I was always meant…

23:44.424 --> 23:45.676
to return to Him.

23:48.262 --> 23:49.555
I see you.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.725
-You're rotten inside.
-That's enough!

23:54.643 --> 23:56.311
Holy shit. This dinner is fun.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.356
Leanne has been going through some things.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.358
What things?

24:01.942 --> 24:03.443
Private things.

24:04.528 --> 24:06.697
This dinner has been eventful,

24:06.780 --> 24:11.952
but maybe we all just need to
call it a night and get some sleep.

24:12.703 --> 24:14.621
-You understand?
-Of course.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.209
I meant no offense.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.297
-You don't have to leave this second.
-It's okay.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.423
Leanne.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.509
I don't know if my being a minister
is triggering for you,

24:27.593 --> 24:32.264
but I want you to know that my door
is always open if you ever wanna talk.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.433
About anything.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.310
Anything?

24:37.561 --> 24:39.104
My secrets and yours?

24:40.189 --> 24:41.481
My secrets?

24:49.489 --> 24:54.578
Sean, what we say
in prayer group is private.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.040
I never said a word. I promise.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.499
Thank you…

25:00.292 --> 25:03.086
for a lovely dinner.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.423
Did you like hearing her cry
when you hit her?

25:08.175 --> 25:09.593
I think you did.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.097
I think you liked that she was small.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.683
Like an insect.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.896
You can only focus on
the good works you do today,

25:20.979 --> 25:23.398
and for that you have to forgive yourself.

25:24.483 --> 25:25.734
God won't fix you.

25:25.817 --> 25:30.280
How dare you judge me?

25:30.906 --> 25:34.076
Be careful, Nancy. Some insects bite.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.994
Poof.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.330
You're gone.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.585
Well, thank you. Everyone.

25:44.336 --> 25:45.337
Nancy.

25:47.339 --> 25:48.549
Oh, God. That was--

25:49.174 --> 25:50.759
Perfection, maybe?

25:51.969 --> 25:53.178
Nancy.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.264
Nancy, wait.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.016
Get the fuck away from me.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.154
Well, that was intense. You okay?

26:11.238 --> 26:12.739
I feel pretty good, actually.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.701
How'd you know Nancy was so naughty?

26:17.536 --> 26:19.079
I just guessed.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.414
Well, good guess.

26:20.497 --> 26:24.334
This subreddit I just found says
good old Nanc was charged with assault

26:24.418 --> 26:26.753
on her own mother in 2012.

26:27.671 --> 26:31.800
Fuck, and the mom was battling
dementia at the time.

26:32.843 --> 26:35.179
Nancy.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.599
Will you teach me to smoke marijuana?

26:40.184 --> 26:42.644
Excuse me? Marijuana?

26:43.562 --> 26:44.855
Oh, my God.

26:45.689 --> 26:46.982
Yeah. Yeah.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.360
First off, pre-rolled is the way to go.

26:51.528 --> 26:53.822
Relax. This is my old stash.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.241
This shit is weak as hell.
Perfect for you.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.452
Okay, so…

26:59.703 --> 27:01.413
just suck in.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.833
Good. Now just take in
a little bit of air.

27:06.001 --> 27:08.337
Perfect. Now just let it all out.

27:10.631 --> 27:11.632
Attagirl.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.761
No. I'm good, thanks.

27:16.845 --> 27:18.305
No, you're not, Julian.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.684
So are we friends again?

27:25.145 --> 27:26.980
Is that what you think we were?

27:36.740 --> 27:38.408
Dude, get the fuck out of here.

27:39.660 --> 27:40.869
Are you okay?

27:41.703 --> 27:42.829
I'm fine.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.832
Thank you for checking on me.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.299
Leanne. You should come in now.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.219
Julian, lock the gate behind you.

28:19.074 --> 28:24.955
Chef Mary Ann, we proudly crown you
the 2019 Gourmet Gauntlet Champion.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.332
Congratulations.

28:29.751 --> 28:33.046
Chef Mary Ann. Cooking is about heart.

28:33.130 --> 28:37.718
To be the best, you must leave no room
to love anything else.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.846
Thank you. This means so much to me.

28:40.929 --> 28:43.182
I'm finally gonna get to open
my brunch place

28:43.265 --> 28:46.226
and my daughter, Doris,
is gonna be so excited.

28:46.310 --> 28:47.811
Congratulations.

28:47.895 --> 28:49.229
Thank you.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.446
Leanne!

28:59.615 --> 29:00.616
Leanne?

29:02.326 --> 29:03.410
What are you doing up here?

29:07.289 --> 29:10.334
Potato chips are perfect. Do you want one?

29:10.417 --> 29:11.668
What was that down there?

29:12.628 --> 29:14.171
Nancy sucks.

29:15.339 --> 29:18.717
There is no way you could have known
that story about Nancy.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.680
I thought we were on the same side here.

29:25.307 --> 29:29.102
I'm always on your side.
Could you just be on my side for once?

29:29.186 --> 29:31.230
We are on your side. We are.

29:31.313 --> 29:33.565
No, you're not. Not like--

29:36.276 --> 29:38.904
Leanne, I believe in Him.
Even if you don't.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.989
He brought my son back to me, through you.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.785
God didn't bring back Jericho.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.039
Then who did?

29:58.882 --> 30:00.300
Take the job, Sean.

30:01.552 --> 30:02.678
It'll be fine.
