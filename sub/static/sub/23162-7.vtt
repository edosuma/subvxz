WEBVTT

01:08.637 --> 01:12.232
If he's not ready to go when it's
time to leave, we're going without him.

01:12.774 --> 01:15.208
We're not going
to the funeral without him.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.872
Hey, he's your son.
I'm only his stepfather.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.914
But he's not gonna waltz in
here after all these years

01:19.982 --> 01:22.382
and expect me to
dance to his tune.

01:23.218 --> 01:24.776
Could you help me
with this?

01:26.021 --> 01:28.216
I just don't like
his attitude, that's all.

01:28.790 --> 01:29.779
Frank...

01:29.858 --> 01:32.725
And don't tell me he doesn't
have an attitude, 'cause he does.

01:32.928 --> 01:35.192
I'm just not gonna put up
with it this time, that's it.

01:35.297 --> 01:38.323
I wish we could all just
get along this time. Okay?

01:38.867 --> 01:40.835
I gotta check
on the driver.

01:41.203 --> 01:42.295
Do you think we could do that?

01:42.437 --> 01:43.995
I can do that.
Talk to him.

01:46.008 --> 01:48.602
Listen, we've got 27 minutes.
It's a 20-minute drive.

01:49.811 --> 01:51.039
I'll be right down.

01:59.855 --> 02:01.117
Are you all right?

02:04.326 --> 02:06.726
I'm fine.
I'll be right there.

02:29.384 --> 02:32.080
Mommy, when is
Grandpa Everett coming back?

02:32.187 --> 02:33.552
He isn't
coming back, Billy.

02:33.622 --> 02:35.453
We talked about that,
remember?

02:35.857 --> 02:36.983
No.

02:37.292 --> 02:39.852
Sure you do.
We're going to the church today

02:39.928 --> 02:43.830
with Uncle Frank and Aunt
Katherine to say good-bye to him.

02:46.101 --> 02:47.363
I don't want to.

02:48.737 --> 02:50.568
All right,
let's go, let's go.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.640
Uh-uh. I'm going to
wait here for Great-grandpa.

02:53.942 --> 02:55.409
He's coming back.

02:56.912 --> 03:00.177
You're gonna apply the seat of
your pants to the seat of that car

03:00.282 --> 03:03.615
before I put your butt in a sling.
You got that, plebe?

03:03.718 --> 03:04.878
No!

03:06.121 --> 03:07.179
Hey!

03:07.622 --> 03:10.216
Oh, it's okay, Frank. It's okay.
He can stay here with me.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.849
I've got a lot to do before
everyone gets back, anyway.

03:13.395 --> 03:16.330
He's not the first kid that had to
face up to something he didn't want to.

03:16.465 --> 03:20.367
No. But he's my kid. So I guess I get
to decide whether he goes or stays home.

03:21.703 --> 03:22.692
All right.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.798
But don't come crying to me when he
wants to wear a dress to the senior prom.

03:42.557 --> 03:44.149
You almost ready?

03:45.026 --> 03:46.288
Almost.

03:46.528 --> 03:48.689
It's great to see these
home movies again.

03:49.197 --> 03:50.789
Karyn found them
in the attic.

03:50.866 --> 03:52.800
She thought you'd
get a kick out of them.

03:53.268 --> 03:55.395
We'd better go.
We're going to be late.

03:55.804 --> 03:57.032
No, we're not.

03:57.172 --> 04:00.903
Frank set all the clocks ahead
ten minutes. I checked.

04:01.877 --> 04:03.572
You checked our clocks?

04:03.812 --> 04:07.373
Well, I figured Frank might do something
like that just to keep us on schedule.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.980
See? Right on time.

04:13.054 --> 04:15.386
You're not going
to make him crazy?

04:15.457 --> 04:16.947
Of course not.

04:17.225 --> 04:20.820
On the other hand, it never hurts just
to let Frank sweat it out a little.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.925
Makes his neck get all kind
of red just above the collar.

04:24.733 --> 04:27.793
You have a strong streak
of your grandfather in you.

04:29.237 --> 04:30.431
I know.

04:30.539 --> 04:32.336
Well, don't push it too far.

04:32.541 --> 04:36.136
You won't like the way my neck
turns red just above the collar.

04:37.145 --> 04:39.670
I'm right behind you. Honest.

04:49.090 --> 04:53.493
Everett Wendell Currier
wasn't like other people.

04:53.962 --> 04:58.922
Oh, I know every kid on Earth
thinks his grandfather is special,

05:00.001 --> 05:05.837
different than everyone else.
But my grandfather, he had a gift.

05:06.975 --> 05:10.342
I mean, he was great at the usual stuff,
pitching baseballs to you,

05:11.012 --> 05:12.877
showing you
how to build things,

05:13.782 --> 05:17.980
running behind you on your two-wheeler
till you got the balance just right,

05:18.587 --> 05:22.318
sitting up with you all night helping
you memorize your graduation speech,

05:23.425 --> 05:27.020
and then sticking around
after the ceremonies

05:27.529 --> 05:29.929
to tell you it was okay
you forgot most of it.

05:31.733 --> 05:35.362
In fact,
whenever you needed him,

05:36.438 --> 05:38.838
he had a knack of
being real close by.

05:39.908 --> 05:41.375
But his real gift...

05:43.144 --> 05:49.174
His real gift was knowing how
to not take life too seriously.

05:51.553 --> 05:54.750
I mean, he had a way of
sitting back

05:55.090 --> 05:58.287
and looking at the silly ways things
have of turning out sometimes,

05:58.360 --> 06:03.593
and knowing that that's exactly
the way they're supposed to be.

06:04.165 --> 06:06.360
And I wouldn't be
surprised at all

06:07.969 --> 06:10.631
if that's pretty much
what he's doing right now.

06:12.107 --> 06:16.271
I know he'd be proud of me for
remembering this whole speech

06:21.383 --> 06:25.683
without him
helping me learn it.

06:30.158 --> 06:32.353
But the thing he'd be
most proud of

06:33.561 --> 06:35.859
and that would be
most important to him

06:37.132 --> 06:39.123
would be knowing that
we all got together here

06:39.200 --> 06:41.225
to remember the good times
we had with him,

06:43.438 --> 06:45.668
and not feel sorry
for ourselves

06:46.041 --> 06:48.669
because we have to go on
now, without him.

06:51.112 --> 06:52.477
I'll miss him.

06:54.816 --> 06:57.717
But I really can't believe
he'll ever be very far away.

07:10.765 --> 07:13.427
As part of my grandfather's
last requests,

07:14.436 --> 07:17.701
Miss Winobe of the Tidewater
Community Church Choir

07:18.940 --> 07:20.737
will sing his favorite song.

07:31.486 --> 07:33.852
Oh happy day

07:34.222 --> 07:36.383
I fixed my choice

07:36.458 --> 07:40.986
On thee, my Savior and my God

07:41.830 --> 07:44.958
I can't believe he actually
chose Oh Happy Day for his funeral.

07:45.233 --> 07:46.393
He didn't.

07:46.601 --> 07:48.762
He chose
Goodbye Cruel World.

07:49.804 --> 07:52.568
I thought this was more appropriate.
Katherine!

07:54.042 --> 07:57.910
Have some of the food your cousin
Karyn spent two days preparing.

07:58.146 --> 07:59.374
Katherine!

08:09.824 --> 08:10.813
Hi.

08:19.634 --> 08:20.862
Whoo!

08:21.703 --> 08:22.931
Gee!

08:23.838 --> 08:26.500
Karyn,
you scared me to death.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.372
I would have thought by now you would've
learned not to sneak up on people.

08:29.444 --> 08:31.344
What are you talking about?
I don't sneak up on people.

08:31.413 --> 08:32.778
You do, too.
You always did.

08:32.847 --> 08:35.441
That's a terrible thing to say.
Yes, but it's true.

08:36.150 --> 08:37.743
I had to be sneaky
when we were kids.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.217
You guys were always
trying to ditch me.

08:39.287 --> 08:42.552
Well, that's because boy cousins don't
like their little girl cousins around

08:42.624 --> 08:44.148
when they're kids.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.522
That's what Grandpa said.
I didn't buy it from him either.

08:48.196 --> 08:50.323
So, are you gonna stick
around Tidewater a while?

08:50.765 --> 08:53.563
Oh, I swore I wasn't
going to ask you that.

08:53.635 --> 08:55.466
Pretend I never said that.
I don't even want to know.

08:55.537 --> 08:56.970
Really.
I don't even wanna know.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.176
Why don't you have some zucchini sticks?
Oh.

09:02.644 --> 09:06.876
Nobody ever eats them
except you and Grandpa.

09:08.249 --> 09:09.944
Hey, I'll take care of it.

09:13.955 --> 09:15.684
Okay,
I gotta go check on the...

09:16.891 --> 09:18.222
Something in the kitchen.

09:38.346 --> 09:39.370
Hi.

09:41.549 --> 09:44.177
How'd you like to help me finish
off these zucchini sticks?

09:45.553 --> 09:47.077
Are you really my cousin?

09:47.889 --> 09:49.413
Well, I'm your mom's cousin.

09:49.858 --> 09:51.758
See, when your mom and l
were your age,

09:51.926 --> 09:54.520
we used to come over here and
stay with your great-grandpa.

09:55.230 --> 09:56.959
With her other cousin, Joey.

09:57.632 --> 09:58.621
Yeah.

09:58.933 --> 10:02.699
Anyway, your great-grandpa used to
make these zucchini sticks for us,

10:02.871 --> 10:05.806
but I was the only one who
figured out how good they were.

10:06.708 --> 10:07.697
See?

10:08.276 --> 10:09.265
Mmm.

10:09.644 --> 10:11.407
Here. Try one.

10:16.484 --> 10:17.644
Shh!

10:20.255 --> 10:21.722
Tastes like squash.

10:22.090 --> 10:23.717
That's the secret ingredient.

10:24.826 --> 10:27.624
Here. Just save
one for me, okay?

10:38.373 --> 10:39.362
Hi.

10:39.841 --> 10:40.865
Oh.

10:40.942 --> 10:41.931
Hi.

10:42.977 --> 10:45.605
I was looking for
that box of Dad's

10:45.680 --> 10:48.979
and I keep running across things.
Memories.

10:49.517 --> 10:50.779
Look at these.

10:51.286 --> 10:53.083
Karyn's first tap shoes.

10:54.022 --> 10:56.490
Now, don't tell her
her grandfather saved them.

10:56.558 --> 10:57.855
She'll cry for a week.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.254
She always had a flair
for the dramatic.

11:02.463 --> 11:06.263
Dad always made her wear them
when you kids would stay with him.

11:07.969 --> 11:11.302
I think it was so she
couldn't sneak up on him.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.806
She and Billy are
going to stay the weekend.

11:17.278 --> 11:19.872
What, with her divorce
and Dad's death,

11:21.115 --> 11:23.640
Billy's having
a hard time adjusting.

11:24.786 --> 11:27.812
Joey's boxing gloves.
Remember these?

11:29.223 --> 11:31.453
I think I'll
give them to Billy.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.087
I don't think Joey would mind.
Do you think Joey...

11:41.169 --> 11:42.568
You rotten kid!

11:45.373 --> 11:48.900
I was sure I gave that mask to
the church bazaar years ago.

11:48.977 --> 11:51.104
You did.
Grandpa bought it back for me.

11:51.179 --> 11:52.669
He said he was
saving it for me.

11:53.014 --> 11:54.003
Oh.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.582
The box.

12:07.829 --> 12:09.456
Can I ask you a question?

12:09.897 --> 12:12.422
As long as I don't have to
promise to answer.

12:13.735 --> 12:15.100
How's Frank?

12:18.373 --> 12:20.238
Why don't you ask him?

12:23.211 --> 12:25.839
As long as Frank
can fly, he's okay.

12:27.849 --> 12:31.478
We should take a run out and see his
air freight company while you're here.

12:31.953 --> 12:33.045
Yeah.

12:33.554 --> 12:36.819
Yeah. Well, I got a lot of
things to do while I'm here.

12:39.761 --> 12:43.197
It hasn't been easy on Frank.
Retirement.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.393
What, with the company
eating up our savings

12:46.601 --> 12:48.728
and having to move
back in with Dad.

12:49.871 --> 12:51.998
Frank's got a lot of pride.

12:54.108 --> 12:57.043
Ah! Victory.

13:01.849 --> 13:06.252
Your grandfather's
grandfather received a letter,

13:07.255 --> 13:11.055
right after the war between the states,
signed by Abraham Lincoln.

13:11.893 --> 13:15.727
Yeah, I used to make him drag it
out every summer to show my friends.

13:16.497 --> 13:19.830
He felt it was the only
thing he had of real value.

13:21.202 --> 13:23.864
He wanted you to have it.

13:34.682 --> 13:36.582
I'd almost
forgotten about this.

13:37.952 --> 13:39.249
It isn't here.

13:40.321 --> 13:41.481
What?

13:42.724 --> 13:43.952
The letter's gone.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.091
Katherine! Katherine!

13:56.737 --> 13:58.671
What the hell is it
with you people?

13:58.839 --> 14:02.172
Frank, the letter's gone. Remember
the one Dad showed us at Christmas?

14:02.276 --> 14:03.709
Didn't you hear me
calling you?

14:03.777 --> 14:05.267
We were looking
for the letter, Frank.

14:05.346 --> 14:08.315
People are leaving. You're up
here looking for some old letter?

14:08.382 --> 14:10.543
It's not just some old letter.

14:10.618 --> 14:14.213
Listen, people have come from all
over to pay their respects to Everett.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.112
They're wondering
where you are.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.055
I didn't think it would
take us this long.

14:18.492 --> 14:20.289
I'm sure
they'll understand.

14:20.394 --> 14:22.385
You're sure they'll
understand, I see.

14:22.463 --> 14:23.828
That changes everything,
doesn't it?

14:23.898 --> 14:25.798
We're on our way,
right now.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.493
No. Wait a minute.
- Thomas.

14:27.568 --> 14:29.502
We'll look for
the letter later.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.498
Frank's right.
I'll be downstairs.

14:37.845 --> 14:40.814
It's been a few years since you've
seen these people yourself, you know.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.405
I know how long
it's been, Frank.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.060
I don't believe it.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.746
Don Eddy Rice.

15:16.617 --> 15:19.017
Bad news.
I can only stay a month.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.314
Hey...

15:23.991 --> 15:26.619
I told my boss if he didn't
give me the weekend off, I was gonna quit.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.523
Four Corners.
We're going out to Mike's place.

15:28.629 --> 15:29.618
Nope.

15:29.830 --> 15:32.663
I had the graveyard, you know, otherwise
I would have been here this morning.

15:32.733 --> 15:33.995
But what can you do?

15:34.068 --> 15:35.160
Veronica's?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.202
No, we're not
going out to Veronica's.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.739
That's right, we're not.
You're right. we're not.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.570
Remember, she moved to Fairfax
Township in her senior year.

15:42.643 --> 15:43.667
Yeah, that's right.

15:43.744 --> 15:45.371
Now, don't tell me.
I'll get this. All right.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.176
Hey, man, I gotta tell you,
I'm real sorry I missed the funeral.

15:51.252 --> 15:54.881
I spent so much time at that house,
he might just as well have been my grandfather.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.480
Well, I'm just glad
you're here.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.156
Tidewater High.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.588
Ta-da!

16:25.653 --> 16:27.484
Huh? What do you say,
right?

16:27.554 --> 16:29.146
Well, you gotta expect
a little something

16:29.223 --> 16:31.623
when you come home for the
first time in 15 years.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.455
Duke of Earl, duke, duke

18:47.561 --> 18:49.688
Duke of Earl, duke, duke

18:49.763 --> 18:51.822
Duke of Earl, duke, duke

18:51.899 --> 18:53.992
Duke of Earl, duke, duke

18:54.067 --> 18:58.504
As I walk through
this world

18:58.739 --> 19:02.038
Nothing can stop
the Duke of Earl

19:02.109 --> 19:06.671
And you, you are my girl

19:06.747 --> 19:10.148
No one can hurt you
Shh!

19:10.217 --> 19:12.651
'Cause I...
Shh!

19:15.756 --> 19:19.385
You could've at least told me
her whole family was there.

19:20.394 --> 19:22.089
I felt so...
Guilty!

19:22.162 --> 19:23.186
No! Old.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.788
Hey, listen, it happens to
all of us, except

19:25.866 --> 19:28.334
maybe your cousin,
you know.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.724
Karyn?

19:29.803 --> 19:33.068
Yeah, I never noticed how good-looking
she was when we were growing up.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.770
I can't believe it,
I mean, she was married.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.436
Shh!

19:42.082 --> 19:44.346
Frank.
Forgot, forgot, forgot...

19:44.418 --> 19:46.784
Shouldn't he be off invading
Poland or something?

19:47.754 --> 19:48.982
No, he retired.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.252
You gotta pick your guard up.
That's the first thing you gotta do.

19:57.331 --> 19:58.320
Just like that.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.595
You're not keeping
your guard up.

20:03.971 --> 20:08.340
All right. Come on. All right,
hit back. Come on, you little creep.

20:08.609 --> 20:10.372
Do you think he sold it?

20:10.444 --> 20:13.470
No, he was emphatic.
"The letter goes to Tom."

20:13.881 --> 20:15.212
Stop it!

20:17.518 --> 20:19.577
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.416
Watch it. Hold it.
Come over here.

20:25.025 --> 20:27.084
Boy, it's Joey
all over again.

20:27.928 --> 20:29.395
There was another key.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.422
Come on, you little rascal.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.762
What's he trying to do?
Make Billy run away, too?

20:35.135 --> 20:37.160
Keep your guard up,
I told you.

20:41.842 --> 20:44.367
It's gone.
The other key is gone.

20:46.547 --> 20:47.741
Who knew about it?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.441
I don't know.
You, me, Karyn.

20:51.985 --> 20:52.974
Frank?

20:53.554 --> 20:55.954
Any number of Dad's friends.
I don't know.

20:56.223 --> 20:58.123
So we start with
who had a motive.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.386
Oh, Tom,
this is your family.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.387
Look, somebody took that
letter... BlLLY: Let me down!

21:04.998 --> 21:06.363
Get away!

21:07.634 --> 21:08.760
Get off me!

21:08.869 --> 21:11.463
Winner and still champion.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.699
Put me down!
Put him down.

21:14.308 --> 21:17.175
Hell, you gotta be tough
to take on the champ.

21:17.344 --> 21:18.902
Put him down, Frank.

21:21.582 --> 21:23.413
Ah, a contender.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.650
A challenger
to take on the champ.

21:25.819 --> 21:27.218
Let's see what you've got.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.912
Come on. Put it there.
Come on.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.655
Come on. You got what it takes,
you think?

21:34.027 --> 21:36.689
Come on, give me one
right there, what do you say?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.288
Bang! Bang!
Dropped your gun.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.631
Wanna run away from a fight?
Come on. Nobody beats Frank Peterson.

21:42.803 --> 21:43.792
Nobody.

22:07.661 --> 22:12.223
Frank has to go out to the airport.
He asked if you'd like to come along.

22:15.936 --> 22:19.030
People have funny ways
of saying, "I'm sorry."

22:19.773 --> 22:21.104
Why do you
put up with him?

22:21.575 --> 22:25.306
I don't have to. He doesn't
have anything to prove with me.

22:26.246 --> 22:28.714
Maybe it was a mistake
for me to come home.

22:29.149 --> 22:31.982
How can you say that?
Your grandfather just died.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.817
I would think you could put your
personal feelings... You're right.

22:34.888 --> 22:36.981
You're right. ...about Frank aside.
Long enough to come home

22:37.057 --> 22:38.285
for the funeral.
You're right.

22:41.328 --> 22:45.389
If you have as much of your
grandfather in you as I think you do...

22:46.066 --> 22:48.364
He was much more
forgiving than I am.

22:50.270 --> 22:51.669
I don't think so.

23:11.658 --> 23:12.750
Well...

23:14.327 --> 23:17.387
Place looks like a second-rate
pile of used tin, doesn't it?

23:17.497 --> 23:18.964
No. It looks good.

23:19.032 --> 23:20.465
Don't kid a kidder.

23:21.201 --> 23:24.034
It looks like a grade-B company.
Which it is.

23:25.539 --> 23:27.097
Or I should say it was.

23:29.309 --> 23:30.537
Right on schedule.

23:41.388 --> 23:44.016
Peterson Air Freight
has just expanded.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.555
What do you say
we take a little spin?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.249
Come on.

23:48.729 --> 23:50.287
Frank, what on Earth?

23:54.101 --> 23:57.332
I thought we were waiting.
We don't have the money.

23:57.671 --> 24:01.334
You don't need money, my dear,
when you have charm and influence.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.208
I named her Katherine.

24:08.949 --> 24:12.749
Well, let's not all
jump up and down at once.

24:16.089 --> 24:18.853
You don't buy airplanes with
charm and influence, Frank.

24:20.794 --> 24:21.920
What is this?

24:22.429 --> 24:24.090
I just think we have
a right to know

24:24.164 --> 24:26.064
Are you interrogating me?
where you got the money.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.498
You do. You do.

24:28.902 --> 24:32.099
You think you can come back
here once every 15 years or so

24:32.172 --> 24:34.299
and start asking
a lot of questions?

24:34.708 --> 24:37.768
If you wanna know what's going on,
come home every once in a while.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.172
Come on,
I'll show you the inside.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.577
Where did you get
the money, Frank?

24:40.647 --> 24:41.807
It's none of your
damn business.

24:41.882 --> 24:43.406
Frank.
You stay out of this, Katherine.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.643
No, I'm not going to
let you do this anymore.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.617
I've tried to look the other way
when you walked all over my mother.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.121
Thomas, that's not true!
No, l... No!

24:50.824 --> 24:53.224
Now, I've tried to convince
myself not to worry that

24:53.293 --> 24:55.784
you're dragging her into bankruptcy
with this joke of a company.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.797
But when you start stealing from us,
somebody's got to draw the line.

24:59.232 --> 25:00.256
Stealing...

25:00.333 --> 25:01.459
Are you calling me
a thief?

25:01.535 --> 25:04.936
I'd just like to know how far you'd
go to keep Peterson Air Freight alive.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.404
Sell a family heirloom?

25:06.573 --> 25:11.010
Turn something of sentimental value into
a business investment for Frank Peterson.

25:11.311 --> 25:12.505
I ought to...
Oh, what?

25:12.579 --> 25:15.173
Hit me? That always works.
Doesn't it? Stop it, both of you.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.307
I mean, you've always bullied
everybody who ever loved you

25:17.384 --> 25:19.113
until they can't stand
to be around you anymore.

25:19.186 --> 25:20.813
That's a lie!
Yeah? What about Joey?

25:20.887 --> 25:22.252
I wonder what
he'd say about that.

25:22.322 --> 25:23.448
Thomas.

25:32.265 --> 25:33.698
I never bullied Joey.

25:35.135 --> 25:36.568
That's a damn lie.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.135
Maybe you were right.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.008
Maybe you
shouldn't have come home.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.668
I just can't believe
what you're saying.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.898
I mean,
Frank is a lot of things.

26:12.973 --> 26:16.568
Okay, he's loud and he's pushy,
but he's basically an honorable guy.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.905
I mean, he's not a thief.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.502
Who else knew
about the extra key?

26:19.913 --> 26:20.902
I did.

26:21.114 --> 26:23.105
Are you going to
start thinking I took it?

26:23.316 --> 26:26.183
All I'm saying is he had a motive,
he had opportunity.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.319
Maybe you've been doing
this Pl stuff too long.

26:28.388 --> 26:30.913
You start looking at your
friends and family as suspects.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.389
It's private investigator,
and somebody took that letter.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.758
Maybe Grandpa Everett has it.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.096
You can ask him
when he gets back.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.262
Billy, he's not coming back.
Sweetie, you know that.

26:45.472 --> 26:46.769
He is, too!

26:47.107 --> 26:48.506
Billy, stop... Ow!

26:49.376 --> 26:51.037
You okay?
I'm all right.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.238
You want me to go...
No. I'll go.

26:57.517 --> 27:01.476
Look, I know you and Frank have
had your problems for a long time.

27:01.554 --> 27:03.579
This has nothing
to do with that.

27:03.657 --> 27:06.820
I just think you have to be
careful what you're doing.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.087
You could pull
this whole family apart.

27:09.229 --> 27:12.323
No. That's Frank's style.
I'm just standing up to him, finally.

27:14.334 --> 27:15.767
I need a ride into town.

27:16.169 --> 27:17.397
No problem.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.405
If you want my opinion...

27:21.975 --> 27:24.637
All right, even if you
don't want my opinion.

27:24.711 --> 27:27.339
Come on, Tom, Frank is a jerk.
I can't deny that.

27:27.414 --> 27:30.440
But let's face it. The guy worships
the ground your mom walks on.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.747
He's not gonna sell
something that belongs to her.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.080
MRS. WlLSON: Bingo!

27:34.754 --> 27:37.188
A letter signed
Abraham Lincoln,

27:37.357 --> 27:41.885
authenticated, went for
$48,000 last month.

27:42.295 --> 27:44.263
Written to
the Secretary of State,

27:44.364 --> 27:46.696
it outlined some
form of policy.

27:46.967 --> 27:48.264
That's the wrong one.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.002
Oh. Drat!

27:52.038 --> 27:55.007
Well, I'll keep my
ears to the ground.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.903
Could it have been sold privately?
Without an offering?

27:59.846 --> 28:02.076
Well, anything's possible
in this crazy business.

28:02.415 --> 28:05.782
But I'd say it's most likely that
he turned it over to an agent

28:05.852 --> 28:07.911
who would give him an advance
on the auction price.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.549
What kind of advance?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.514
Oh, around 10%.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.654
Enough for a down payment
on a refurbished DC-3.

28:15.095 --> 28:16.756
Okay, where do we go now?

28:16.997 --> 28:19.227
To see a man about a loan.
Thanks, Mrs. Wilson.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.267
I took this one the day
they dedicated the memorial.

28:25.338 --> 28:28.273
Should've been there.
Should've seen all the Vietnam vets.

28:28.341 --> 28:29.638
It was really something.

28:30.477 --> 28:31.967
I guess you guys
have been out there.

28:33.313 --> 28:34.575
No. Not yet.

28:35.582 --> 28:36.810
Oh, you got to go.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.045
It's got this,

28:39.552 --> 28:41.349
I don't know,
feeling about it that's...

28:41.955 --> 28:43.286
Well, you shouldn't miss it.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.288
Anyway, let me get those
papers for you.

28:48.161 --> 28:51.130
I'm kind of surprised Frank didn't call
to tell me you were coming after them.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.357
He doesn't know I'm here.

28:55.101 --> 28:59.435
I wasn't sure you'd show me the loan papers.
That's why I said Frank needed them.

29:02.709 --> 29:07.043
I'm afraid I've gotten into
some bad habits. I'm sorry.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.515
You don't have to show me the papers
if you don't feel like it, Skip.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.618
Well, I just wish you'd asked.

29:16.456 --> 29:20.483
See, there's some question as to
where Frank got the down payment.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.191
You don't know about this?

29:23.096 --> 29:25.087
He took out a trust deed
on the house.

29:26.099 --> 29:27.088
What house?

29:27.167 --> 29:28.327
Your grandfather's.

29:28.501 --> 29:31.163
Everett signed it over to
Frank about two years ago.

29:31.538 --> 29:32.732
He never told you?

29:46.186 --> 29:47.676
I thought you were Frank.

29:47.987 --> 29:48.976
Where is he?

29:50.156 --> 29:53.887
I've decided to pack everything away.
Quit looking for the letter.

29:54.060 --> 29:57.860
I can't believe Dad meant
for it to cause such pain.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.460
After the fireworks
between the two of you,

30:02.602 --> 30:05.867
he took the plane up.
He hasn't come back yet.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.368
Why didn't you tell me
about the house?

30:17.417 --> 30:19.078
Did he tell you he
mortgaged it?

30:20.353 --> 30:23.811
You've been prying into
Frank's business affairs.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.016
Did he tell you?

30:28.328 --> 30:29.317
No.

30:29.596 --> 30:30.858
This house...

30:31.631 --> 30:33.758
This house belongs to you.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.491
Now, why did you let
Grandpa sign it over to Frank?

30:36.970 --> 30:39.063
Frank is my husband.

30:39.139 --> 30:41.073
He has every right
to this house.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.740
And a right to lose it?

30:42.842 --> 30:44.332
When are you gonna start
saying no to him?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.378
You're on
dangerous ground here, Tom.

30:46.446 --> 30:49.142
No. We are on very dangerous ground.
Don't you see that?

30:49.282 --> 30:51.648
I'm not going to let him hurt
you the way he hurt Joey.

30:51.818 --> 30:53.149
He didn't.

30:54.254 --> 30:55.551
Don't you know?

30:56.389 --> 31:00.382
He used to cry himself to sleep because
he wasn't good enough for Frank.

31:00.627 --> 31:03.926
He wouldn't live up to all the
standards that Frank set for him.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.621
Why do you think he ran away?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.761
Why do you think
he didn't come back?

31:09.669 --> 31:11.637
Do you think I haven't
asked myself that?

31:12.105 --> 31:16.303
Do you think I haven't sat up nights
just staring at stars, blaming Frank,

31:16.576 --> 31:18.373
blaming myself, blaming you?

31:20.246 --> 31:21.270
Me?

31:21.814 --> 31:25.011
You never considered that
you were partly to blame?

31:25.518 --> 31:28.510
All the letters, the photographs,
the medals, the honors.

31:28.588 --> 31:30.249
You were a big hero to him.

31:30.490 --> 31:33.653
Why wouldn't he want to run off
and try to be just like you?

31:48.274 --> 31:50.799
I could never do anything
to hurt Joey.

31:51.778 --> 31:53.439
How could I hurt
my own brother?

31:54.747 --> 31:57.215
Why would Frank
hurt his own son?

32:00.119 --> 32:01.950
Do you have any
idea where Billy is?

32:02.355 --> 32:03.344
No.

32:03.556 --> 32:05.046
I thought he
was with you.

32:05.158 --> 32:06.819
No. I've been out
trying to find him.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.791
I've called the neighbors.
I've looked everywhere.

32:09.862 --> 32:13.457
Joey, Frank, Billy.
What's happening to us?

32:21.574 --> 32:22.700
Anything?

32:23.108 --> 32:26.100
The police have put an all
points bulletin out on him.

32:26.512 --> 32:29.003
We've been up and down every
street for about five miles.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.912
I don't see how he could've
gotten any further away than that.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.751
Well, if you hear from him...
Oh, we'll call right away.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.646
Thank you.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.587
I just never should've pressed
him about Grandpa's death.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.090
He would've come
to accept it in time.

32:42.695 --> 32:43.855
In his own time.

32:44.496 --> 32:45.656
Maybe not.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.428
Tom?
I'll be right back.

33:03.282 --> 33:04.408
What is it?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.644
What was he wearing
on the day of the funeral?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.953
He only has
one pair of Sunday best.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.268
I think I know
where he is.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.275
I don't believe this.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.006
Grandpa told me he tore
that old tree house down.

33:35.748 --> 33:38.216
Probably so you wouldn't
sneak up on him and Billy.

33:41.854 --> 33:42.843
Billy?

33:44.490 --> 33:46.424
I'm not coming back!

33:47.526 --> 33:49.118
My God!
He's all right.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.595
I'm gonna kill him.
No, wait! Wait, wait, wait...

33:55.034 --> 33:56.365
Can I see him alone?

33:57.303 --> 33:59.794
There's something I need
to talk to him about.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.874
All right.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.870
I'll go back.
I'll let everyone know he's okay.

34:57.363 --> 34:58.694
Oh, she left.

35:02.001 --> 35:03.730
I'm not going back.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.005
You mind if I stay awhile?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.876
You know, I've been
thinking and thinking

35:12.945 --> 35:14.970
who might have that letter
we've been looking for.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.309
It belongs to
Grandpa Everett.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.710
Oh, you're right.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.680
And I figured that somebody must
want to keep it for him, you know.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.221
Keep it real safe.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.819
What if he comes back
and it's gone?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.792
Come here.

35:45.611 --> 35:48.136
You know, a long time ago,
before you were born,

35:49.381 --> 35:52.578
somebody I loved very much
went away. Like Grandpa.

35:54.019 --> 35:55.884
And I didn't want him to go.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.512
So, you know what I did?

36:00.459 --> 36:03.758
I pretended
he really wasn't gone.

36:06.098 --> 36:08.464
I just figured that
he had to come back someday

36:08.567 --> 36:10.296
if I really
believed hard enough.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.069
And, as time went on,

36:18.911 --> 36:20.845
and he didn't come back,

36:23.315 --> 36:25.283
I started getting real mad.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.716
I got mad at everybody
who knew him

36:30.789 --> 36:33.485
because I figured it was
their fault he went away.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.819
Was it?

36:38.230 --> 36:39.857
No. It wasn't
anybody's fault.

36:42.367 --> 36:43.994
He didn't come back?

36:44.703 --> 36:45.692
No.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.309
And the sad part is,

36:58.650 --> 37:00.618
I was so busy being mad,

37:03.689 --> 37:06.123
that I never had a chance
to tell him good-bye.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.862
I don't know
how to say good-bye.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.491
I don't either.

37:20.973 --> 37:23.373
Maybe we could
figure out a way together.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.269
Maybe.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.186
Good-bye, Grandpa!

38:15.861 --> 38:17.260
Good-bye!

38:18.630 --> 38:19.756
Good-bye.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.975
Any word from Frank?

38:42.287 --> 38:44.482
No, your mom
went to the airport.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.121
She's real scared.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.820
You don't think Frank
would do anything stupid?

38:53.065 --> 38:54.498
I don't know.

38:55.567 --> 38:56.727
He was...

38:58.337 --> 38:59.497
I don't know.

39:00.072 --> 39:01.403
You had a fight?

39:03.342 --> 39:07.779
Tom, I don't know if this is
gonna make any difference,

39:09.147 --> 39:10.546
but, I want to
tell you something.

39:10.616 --> 39:13.517
Look, l...
No. Let me just say this.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.318
Maybe you thought when
your mom married Frank that,

39:24.363 --> 39:27.764
I don't know, that she
didn't love your dad anymore.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.189
Or you.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.861
No. I...

39:32.104 --> 39:33.935
I know it's not
the same thing,

39:34.006 --> 39:36.133
but when Billy's dad left,

39:36.208 --> 39:39.905
I thought I'd never, ever let anyone
get close to us again, me and Billy.

39:42.014 --> 39:46.610
But as time goes on, you find out
you need to be close to somebody.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.845
So does your kid.

39:51.490 --> 39:55.722
I think you should let
your mom off the hook.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.563
So do l.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.599
I want

40:09.274 --> 40:11.401
you to keep this for Billy.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.310
From Grandpa to me to him.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.954
You're not moving back home,
are you?

41:25.283 --> 41:27.774
I've been way out of line
the last couple days...

41:31.123 --> 41:33.557
For years, about Frank.

41:34.593 --> 41:39.121
When you and Joey were little,
you used to love to watch the air shows.

41:39.664 --> 41:44.192
And every Memorial Day,
we'd all go together to watch Frank fly.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.964
You would hold Joey's hand,

41:48.073 --> 41:51.668
and you'd show him which
plane his father was flying.

41:52.511 --> 41:56.072
They'd zigzag in and out
and fly upside down.

41:58.350 --> 42:01.649
And you and Joey,
you'd cheer Frank on,

42:03.388 --> 42:05.413
as if he could hear you.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.449
Funny...

42:11.329 --> 42:15.060
I was always so scared
when Frank was flying.

42:16.435 --> 42:19.461
And then, one time,
you were explaining to Joey

42:19.538 --> 42:22.234
how some people just
have a knack for flying.

42:23.475 --> 42:25.466
And suddenly I realized,

42:26.945 --> 42:29.573
Frank was as safe in the air

42:31.116 --> 42:32.743
as he was on the ground.

42:34.953 --> 42:39.856
Probably safer, given the way
he has of dealing with people.

42:47.632 --> 42:51.329
How do you explain
why you love someone?

43:00.912 --> 43:02.539
You shouldn't have to.

44:11.683 --> 44:15.949
I guess you think I'm a real
jerk where Joey's concerned.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.684
Frank, l... No, no,
no. Don't deny it.

44:23.595 --> 44:25.927
I've been doing that myself
a lot of years.

44:28.433 --> 44:31.925
You never could
tell that boy anything.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.504
I just wish...

44:43.281 --> 44:44.748
Come back next year.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.243
I'll take you up
for a ride.

44:53.959 --> 44:55.017
Maybe.

45:35.266 --> 45:36.597
Hey, it's morning.

45:41.339 --> 45:42.863
You ever think about Joey?

45:46.344 --> 45:47.470
Every day.

45:48.813 --> 45:50.041
Me, too.

47:10.762 --> 47:11.956
Good-bye, Joey.
