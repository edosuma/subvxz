00:07.430 --> 00:09.080
Paging katie jacobs.

00:07.770 --> 00:10.530
{\a6}POTOMAC MILLS,VIRGINIA

00:09.090 --> 00:11.400
Please report to security immediately.

00:11.410 --> 00:14.890
Katie jacobs,please report to security.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.470
911. State your emergency.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.800
My niece,she's gone.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.310
She's--she's missing. Her mom
and her dad are still looking.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.540
We can't--we
can-- oh,my god.

00:25.550 --> 00:26.590
Ma'am,where are you?

00:26.600 --> 00:28.420
In the,uh--in the
mall,in potomac mills.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.740
She's only 6. Her mom
and dad can't find her.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.000
Who am I speaking with?

00:33.010 --> 00:34.460
Susan jacobs.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.880
Susan,can you tell me your niece's name?

00:36.890 --> 00:39.120
Katie. Please come quick.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.580
- Security's just
not- - katie what?

00:41.740 --> 00:42.600
Um,jacobs.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.650
And where was katie last seen?

00:44.850 --> 00:46.290
This isn't happening.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.770
Ma'am,stay with me.

00:47.780 --> 00:50.590
What if someone took her like
the little girl last week?

00:50.600 --> 00:52.650
- Ma'am- -
oh,my god.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:04.890 --> 01:06.520
Attention,all patrons.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.550
This is an emergency announcement.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.280
We have gone into immediate
lockdown procedure.

01:11.290 --> 01:15.630
Please follow all directions of law
enforcement and security personnel.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.360
Attention,all patrons.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.420
This is an emergency announcement.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.190
We've gone into immediate
lockdown procedure.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.850
Please follow all directions of law
enforcement and security personnel.

01:25.860 --> 01:26.620
Where are the parents?

01:26.630 --> 01:28.560
Over here with the head of security.

01:28.570 --> 01:30.770
Ms.Samuels,thank you.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.290
No problem.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.680
Mr.And mrs.Jacobs,I'm james franklin,

01:34.690 --> 01:37.690
Director of the bureau's
rapid deployment team.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.490
We need a photo of your
daughter. You have one on you?

01:40.500 --> 01:44.280
There was another little girl
who went missing last week.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.280
Maybe on your phone.

01:46.290 --> 01:48.390
Got a picture of katie on your phone?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.080
She disappeared from a mall,too.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.030
She was murdered,right?

01:53.040 --> 01:56.280
Ma'am,it's too early to know
if that case is connected.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.700
Yeah,why so many fbi?

01:57.710 --> 01:59.200
Standard operating procedure.

01:59.210 --> 02:02.010
I've also alerted our
behavioral analysis unit.

02:02.020 --> 02:05.960
If there is a pattern to these
abductions,they'll find it.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.180
Thank you.

02:10.190 --> 02:12.240
Stay with them.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.310
Jim.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.090
We've been in lockdown
for almost 20 minutes.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.390
My team's already in motion.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.270
Another female,same
age,same time of day,

02:21.280 --> 02:22.890
Taken from essentially
the same location.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.960
What makes you sure katie
jacobs is still in the building?

02:24.970 --> 02:27.580
The mall's got cameras installed
at every entrance and exit.

02:27.590 --> 02:30.020
Surveillance video confirms
katie entering the building,

02:30.040 --> 02:31.440
But no sign of her leaving.

02:31.450 --> 02:35.330
Security paged her over the intercom,and
their initial sweep came up empty.

02:35.340 --> 02:37.720
Whoever killed jessica davis
last week left that mall with her

02:37.730 --> 02:39.880
Because he wanted time
with his victim in privacy.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.460
Assuming it's the same offender,he
wouldn't stray from his M.O.

02:42.470 --> 02:44.010
He wouldn't leave here
without his victim.

02:44.020 --> 02:46.450
So if katie's still under
this roof,so is her abductor.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.520
Garcia,report to the
mall's security office.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.540
Reid,morgan,I want you to
find the head of security.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.650
We need all data from every search team.

02:52.660 --> 02:54.270
You guys start with katie's parents.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.670
We'll treat the mall
like a neighborhood,

02:55.680 --> 02:58.300
And we'll separate into
areas of control. Come on.

03:01.400 --> 03:07.110
117 stores,uh,69 storage
closets,73 dressing rooms,

03:07.420 --> 03:10.350
6 men's rooms,6 ladies' rooms,

03:10.360 --> 03:13.580
Exits to the rooftop via the
north and south stairwells,

03:13.590 --> 03:18.050
7 restaurants,each with
separate kitchen,and 4 elevators.

03:18.060 --> 03:20.370
Every team's gonna need a copy of this.

03:21.330 --> 03:24.440
Katie was last seen by her cousin
in the arcade about 25 minutes ago.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.960
She was wearing jeans,a green
shirt,gray sneakers,and ponytails.

03:27.970 --> 03:30.890
Registered offenders located
within a 45-mile radius.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.980
Ok,run this against current
and former employees as well.

03:34.790 --> 03:37.570
If this animal so much as looks
at me wrong once we get him...

03:37.580 --> 03:38.940
I read the jessica davis report.

03:38.950 --> 03:40.800
I know you found the remains last week.

03:40.810 --> 03:42.740
20 years,never seen anything like it.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.790
Can't get the image out of my head.

03:44.990 --> 03:48.950
I joined the bureau to rescue people,not
to stand over another dead kid today.

03:48.960 --> 03:49.750
I couldn't handle it.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.850
Hopefully you won't have to.

03:52.060 --> 03:53.800
It's all chance,you know.

03:53.810 --> 03:55.770
Wrong place at the wrong time.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.250
No logic. No sense.

03:59.010 --> 04:01.440
How does a parent reconcile that?

04:02.470 --> 04:04.010
They never do.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.950
You want every inch of
surveillance footage?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.100
Yes,because I need to examine
it frame by frame to see

04:10.110 --> 04:11.760
If there's anything in the
background you guys missed.

04:11.770 --> 04:15.000
I also need a joystick
controller,video transmitters,

04:15.010 --> 04:18.010
A coax cable,and a programmable park.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.310
And I don't mean that hypothetically.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.250
Ms.Jacobs' cell phone
had katie's picture on it.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.990
Mall security helped us make copies.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.250
Ok,we need to get one of these to every
search team,every officer,every patron.

04:34.260 --> 04:37.070
Potential witnesses need to
know who we're looking for,too.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.230
Problem is our unsub
could be any one of 'em.

04:45.270 --> 04:47.140
There's her parents.

04:51.930 --> 04:52.670
Hi.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.280
We're agents jareau and
prentiss with the B.A.U.

04:55.290 --> 04:57.070
And you must be katie's aunt and uncle.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.390
This can't be easy.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.380
We're here to walk you through this.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.820
Well,aside from the
stairwells,storage closets,

05:05.830 --> 05:08.740
And hundreds of shops,there's a
whole underbelly beneath our feet--

05:08.750 --> 05:11.330
Subterranean level,air
ducts,boiler rooms.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.980
Realistically,it'll take at least...

05:12.990 --> 05:14.430
3 hours to cover this place.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.330
Realistically,we have
less than half that time.

05:16.340 --> 05:17.090
How do you figure?

05:17.100 --> 05:20.900
99% of abducted children who are
killed die within the first 24 hours,

05:20.910 --> 05:22.650
75% within the first 3 hours,

05:22.660 --> 05:26.090
And what only law enforcement knows is
jessica davis joined the 44% of children

05:26.100 --> 05:28.870
Who are abducted and killed
within the first hour.

05:29.470 --> 05:30.750
Yeah. What do you got?

05:30.760 --> 05:35.070
Ok,so this is surveillance footage
off an exit camera outside the arcade.

05:36.810 --> 05:37.990
Well,can't you get a better angle?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.050
Sugar,I'm not london here.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.290
I can only work with what they have.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.250
Believe me when I tell
you the 1980s just called.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.000
They want their security system back.

05:44.010 --> 05:48.840
Ok,look in the far right,middle
section. You see the 2 ponytails?

05:48.850 --> 05:50.020
Yeah. That's katie.

05:50.030 --> 05:53.400
Angle barely got an image of
her,let alone who she was with.

05:53.410 --> 05:55.050
Can you enhance the image for me?

05:55.060 --> 05:57.560
I could start the process. We
don't have that kind of time.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.110
Aw,you are breakin' my heart,baby girl.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.320
Where are you goin'?

06:01.330 --> 06:03.180
And who are you with?

06:39.830 --> 06:41.570
Dostoevsky once said,

06:41.580 --> 06:44.450
"nothing is easier than
denouncing the evildoer.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.530
Nothing more difficult
than understanding him."

06:47.540 --> 06:48.980
Katie jacobs.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.850
This image was captured moments before
your nephew reported katie missing.

06:56.860 --> 06:57.390
Oh,god.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.540
I know the angle's limited,

06:58.550 --> 07:02.630
But is there anything or anyone
in the frame that you recognize?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.730
- No.
- No.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.470
Katie has asthma. She needs her inhaler.

07:11.190 --> 07:14.190
H-how could someone have just taken
her in front of all those people?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.740
That's what we're trying to figure out.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.410
How do you plan on doing that?

07:17.420 --> 07:18.740
We're retracing katie's steps.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.470
We're going over surveillance footage.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.670
We're searching every crack
and crevice under this roof.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.320
I want to be out there
looking for my girl.

07:24.330 --> 07:27.000
I'd want to be doing the same
thing,but when an abduction is reported,

07:27.010 --> 07:29.270
The parents are debriefed separately.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.450
It's more efficient that way.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.480
What do you wanna know?

07:35.680 --> 07:39.890
Did katie have any connection
at all to jessica davis?

07:40.270 --> 07:41.480
No.

07:41.900 --> 07:42.820
There is no connection.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.960
Maybe a dance class,a church group.

07:45.970 --> 07:48.090
You think katie will end up like that?

07:48.100 --> 07:51.180
No,now,mrs.Jacobs,just
listen to me here.I'm just--

07:51.190 --> 07:52.700
is that what you're trying to tell me?

07:52.710 --> 07:55.380
I'm trying to find your daughter.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.980
Look at me.

07:58.590 --> 08:02.830
I know it's excruciating
at a time like this,

08:02.840 --> 08:06.580
But I have to ask these questions,ok?

08:07.310 --> 08:09.380
Just breathe.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.540
Ok.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.360
I want you two to take this path.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.900
I'll meet you there.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.960
Katie.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.120
Katie jacobs.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.950
Katie jacobs.

08:26.150 --> 08:28.110
So she and her cousin came
in here about 30 minutes ago,

08:28.120 --> 08:29.890
And that was the last
time anyone saw katie?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.090
That's right.

08:31.100 --> 08:34.780
10 minutes after the assault is generally
the molester's lowest point of self-esteem.

08:34.789 --> 08:37.610
He could be panicking right about
now,realizing he's got a witness.

08:37.620 --> 08:41.230
Richard allen davis strangled polly klaas
just to prevent her from identifying him.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.320
A single abduction like this would
normally be classified as a snatch-and-grab,

08:44.330 --> 08:45.960
But with the jessica davis abduction,

08:45.970 --> 08:48.090
It's more likely we're dealing
with a preferential offender.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.040
Whose victims fall
into a particular type.

08:50.050 --> 08:51.890
He came to this mall knowing
what he was looking for,

08:51.900 --> 08:55.250
Because he feels safe
here,familiar with his surroundings.

08:55.990 --> 08:59.180
So when you and your cousin
were going in and out of stores,

08:59.190 --> 09:01.950
Did anybody try to talk to her?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.790
I don't think so.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.590
Did somebody maybe compliment her
hair or open the door for you guys?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
He wasn't exactly paying attention.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.910
- Yes,I was.
- Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.510
You'd think after all
my years in retail,

09:14.520 --> 09:17.330
I'd hate the mall,but it was convenient.

09:17.340 --> 09:19.170
She was right next to me,I swear.

09:19.180 --> 09:22.940
And then we split up,because I-- I
had to shop for my husband's birthday.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.930
And that's when you got lost
in that video game,right?

09:24.950 --> 09:26.450
I should have stayed near the kids.

09:26.460 --> 09:27.450
It's not fair.

09:27.460 --> 09:30.440
And now I wish we never
left the house this morning.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.940
I'm sure that's how
my brother feels,too.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.640
How are all these questions getting
us any closer to finding her?

09:37.650 --> 09:40.070
Assuming that she knew not
to walk off with a stranger,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.690
It means she might have trusted the
offender,which can tell us a lot.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.600
Well,then explain to
me what happened to her.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.320
She might have walked off
with someone in uniform.

09:46.330 --> 09:47.760
No,I meant jessica.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.180
I wanna know what happened to that girl.

09:52.060 --> 09:53.410
Katie.

09:54.180 --> 09:55.000
Katie.

09:55.010 --> 09:56.420
Katie jacobs.

09:57.920 --> 09:58.670
Katie.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.110
Katie jacobs.

10:00.590 --> 10:01.580
Katie.

10:02.350 --> 10:05.400
You know,this may all be a mistake.

10:06.390 --> 10:11.450
Katie might just be lost,maybe
in some bookstore or something.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.160
She loves to read.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.020
You know,she could just be
in a corner,just,you know--

10:16.270 --> 10:20.530
Or maybe playing dress-up
in a store or something.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.670
Katie.

10:34.490 --> 10:36.030
Katie jacobs.

10:39.980 --> 10:43.550
Jeremy,we--we asked your mom and
dad if we could talk privately.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.200
Thought it might be easier that way.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.420
'Cause my dad thinks this is my fault.

10:47.430 --> 10:48.200
No.

10:48.210 --> 10:51.070
Jeremy,your dad is just
super upset right now,

10:51.080 --> 10:55.060
Because times like this,people
get really emotional.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.060
Hey,kid...

10:58.550 --> 11:01.930
The moments right before a kidnapping
like this are the most important.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.870
You gotta understand you're the
only one who can help us with that.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.820
But--but I
can't remember.

11:06.830 --> 11:11.190
Jeremy,all we need is the
last thing katie did or said

11:11.200 --> 11:13.360
Before you realized she was gone.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.520
Jeremy.

11:15.910 --> 11:17.330
Jeremy--what?What?What?

11:17.340 --> 11:19.000
What is it? Talk to me.What?

11:19.010 --> 11:20.000
I can't breathe.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.530
Uh,y-you're having a
panic attack. Sit down.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.100
Jeremy,sit down. Sit down.

11:23.110 --> 11:24.270
Want you to put your
head between your knees.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.020
Put your head between
your knees. That's right.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.990
Just breathe. Just breathe.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.260
Is that katie's?

11:49.270 --> 11:50.560
Yeah.

11:52.110 --> 11:54.860
She didn't like it
with her sneakers today.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.110
Said it didn't match.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.370
Would you mind if we
borrowed that sweater?

12:07.010 --> 12:08.160
Why?

12:09.640 --> 12:13.490
It would help the search
dogs to pick up her scent.

12:29.330 --> 12:35.010
Whoever abducted katie did so
by looking at her as an object.

12:35.670 --> 12:39.580
If there's the slightest
chance that he has a conscience,

12:39.590 --> 12:42.610
It may help to remind him she's not.

12:43.750 --> 12:47.180
And,uh,how would you do that?

12:47.930 --> 12:50.110
Well,we wouldn't.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.050
You would.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.430
Hotch.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.560
Thank you.

13:01.570 --> 13:04.590
My guess is jeremy either heard or
saw something that could be useful.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.910
But the guilt has manifested itself
into an acute stress disorder.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.570
The kid can't remember a thing.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.840
Take him back to the scene
and do a cognitive interview.

13:12.850 --> 13:13.970
Ok.

13:17.490 --> 13:18.700
Do you have kids?

13:18.710 --> 13:20.210
No. Not yet.

13:20.220 --> 13:23.430
But everyone that needs
us,we think of as our own.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.620
I don't know if I can do this.

13:31.630 --> 13:34.030
Ok,just--just
stay calm.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.570
Don't address what he's done.

13:35.580 --> 13:37.680
That'll only make him defensive.

13:37.690 --> 13:39.200
Ready.

13:39.630 --> 13:42.480
Just keep the focus on katie.

13:42.490 --> 13:45.810
All right,we need him
to hear who she is.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.670
No one knows that better than you.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.070
My name is beth jacobs.

14:04.790 --> 14:09.170
45 minutes ago,our
daughter katie went missing.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.760
She's only 6 years old.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.400
Last month,she started first grade.

14:20.590 --> 14:24.500
Katie is our only child,and
we love her very much.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.470
We just want her back safe.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.480
The other day...

14:31.490 --> 14:34.660
Katie told me that she
was ready to ride...

14:36.460 --> 14:38.890
A big girl's bike...

14:43.250 --> 14:45.780
Without training wheels...

14:47.940 --> 14:51.710
And I promised her that she
could do that on her birthday.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.100
Please,whoever you are...

15:02.710 --> 15:05.050
I hope you're listening.

15:06.110 --> 15:10.540
We just want our daughter
back to us safely.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.100
Katie is just a little girl.

15:21.110 --> 15:24.390
She's just a little girl who
deserves another birthday.

15:32.460 --> 15:36.590
Only 7 seconds I was able to
decipher,but it's 7 more than we had.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
What are we looking at?

15:37.610 --> 15:40.840
Surveillance footage I retrieved f
ofa second camera on the first floor.

15:40.850 --> 15:44.610
It shows katie exiting the arcade,follows
her movements through the crowd.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.100
She went north.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.230
UNABLE TO LOCATE MATCHING SUBJECT

15:48.240 --> 15:49.640
Till she disappears.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.860
Criminy. I still can't
make out who she was with.

15:51.870 --> 15:52.770
7 seconds...

15:52.780 --> 15:54.030
That's all the images I could find,sir.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.870
Is all it takes for
a child to disappear.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.990
If katie was alone,

15:57.000 --> 16:01.530
The only stores in the vicinity she would be walking
toward would be furniture, Stationary,or bedding.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.100
Nothing that a 6-year-old
would leave an arcade for.

16:04.110 --> 16:08.030
Unless it wasn't a store
that caught her eye.

16:08.450 --> 16:11.770
I once followed todd cortel the entire
length of silver beach because he had a kite.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.830
The right bait might lure
her away from the crowd.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.660
So what are you youngsters
playing these days?

16:26.180 --> 16:28.080
I like...

16:28.090 --> 16:29.660
D.O.A.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.130
D.O.A.?

16:31.320 --> 16:33.820
- As in "dead on arrival"?
- It's "dead or alive."

16:34.410 --> 16:36.450
What do you like so
much about it,jeremy?

16:36.460 --> 16:38.170
The close combat.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.740
It's all about timing,how
well you know your enemies.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.120
Plus I'm really good at it.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.800
Yeah,I bet you are,kid.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.680
So,uh,what was the first game that You
walked to when you came in here earlier?

17:03.300 --> 17:04.930
Girl's trail stops cold?

17:05.480 --> 17:07.530
Because that vent is depositing
air from the food court,

17:07.540 --> 17:09.910
The dog is overwhelmed by the smell.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.180
Katie.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.359
Katie jacobs.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.319
I'm sorry,ma'am. I
can't let you do that.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.260
But I'm his mother,for god sake.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.300
Look,I understand.

17:19.310 --> 17:21.150
I'll take care of this.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.359
Jeremy is talking with 2
of our agents right now.

17:23.369 --> 17:24.599
Well,then,I should be there,too.

17:24.609 --> 17:28.180
Whatever's blocking your son's
memory may be exacerbated by that.

17:28.190 --> 17:31.840
He might be feeling a
bit responsible somehow.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.390
One minute,you're having a
lighter engraved for your husband,

17:34.400 --> 17:38.840
And the next minute,katie's
name is being paged.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.050
I never thought something like
this could happen to our family.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.420
Nobody ever does.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.130
What are they doing to my son?

17:49.140 --> 17:51.370
It's a sensory method of questioning.

17:51.380 --> 17:55.820
We're hoping it'll help jeremy remember what
happened before he realized katie was gone.

17:56.260 --> 17:59.280
I'm gonna ask you to close your
eyes for a minute,all right?

18:00.650 --> 18:03.920
I want you to go back to when you first
walked in the arcade a little earlier.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.600
Can you remember that?

18:05.950 --> 18:07.020
Yeah.

18:07.030 --> 18:08.430
You're doin' great,my man.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.140
Ok,in your mind,I want you to try
and picture what it sounded like ine.

18:13.350 --> 18:15.350
Her picture what it smelled like.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.130
Was it crowded?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.320
It was loud.

18:20.330 --> 18:23.860
Were the people loud,or
were the sound effects loud?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.070
Both.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.060
Some kid was yelling at his game.

18:27.070 --> 18:30.900
Die!

18:31.560 --> 18:33.240
I own you.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.800
You're mine. Now die!

18:37.550 --> 18:38.920
Jeremy,I don't like it here.

18:38.930 --> 18:40.880
Well,tough,because I do.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.740
I want to find my mommy.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.800
Stop whining. I gave you a quarter.

18:45.810 --> 18:47.560
Now go play a game.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.940
Die,die,die.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.350
Die,die,die.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.980
Die,die,die.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.430
What's making you so
uncomfortable,jeremy?

19:06.190 --> 19:09.370
I don't like it in here. Jeremy.

19:17.810 --> 19:19.900
What was she crying about?

19:20.930 --> 19:22.130
I don't remember.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.930
- I-- I couldn't
hear. - Ok.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.370
Jeremy,go back to the video game.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.030
I was winning.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.960
And how'd that make you feel?

19:32.970 --> 19:38.420
Awesome,proud of
myself,kind of embarrassed.

19:38.430 --> 19:40.080
Embarrassed? How?

19:40.090 --> 19:43.170
Like people were watching me.

19:43.180 --> 19:45.550
Why were you self-conscious
who was watching you?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.910
I could smell her shampoo.

19:48.110 --> 19:49.580
Katie's?

19:50.470 --> 19:51.800
No.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.840
Please,I wanna go.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.570
Can we please go?

19:55.580 --> 19:59.120
Die.

20:06.310 --> 20:08.350
Jeremy,I don't like it here.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.930
You like that game,huh?

20:09.940 --> 20:10.900
You wanna play?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.250
We can switch back and
forth for combo attacks.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.600
Please can we go?

20:16.530 --> 20:18.640
Please,jeremy.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.970
Get out of here.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.240
I have extra quarters.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.920
Please,jeremy.

20:23.930 --> 20:26.370
I want an ice cream.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.720
Katie?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.520
- Katie?
- So katie was asking for ice cream?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.790
Yeah.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.180
Was there something else?

20:45.650 --> 20:47.160
No.

20:49.260 --> 20:51.110
You did good,kid.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.100
Picked up katie's scent
on something in here.

20:57.830 --> 21:01.190
Just a lot of half-eaten
food,empty cups.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.470
And this.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.530
What'd you find?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.950
It's a necklace in the trash.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.660
Bag it and label it in
case there's any connection.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.290
There is.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.510
Katie was wearing it.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.460
She found it in the
schoolyard about a year ago.

21:19.470 --> 21:22.120
This is 24-karat gold,and
the stones are real.

21:22.130 --> 21:24.180
Whoever lost it would
have been looking for it.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.400
Is there any reason that
katie would have lied?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.850
No.

21:28.570 --> 21:29.960
How far do you live from here?

21:29.970 --> 21:30.880
About a mile.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.620
Do you mind if we search your house?

21:32.630 --> 21:33.720
Of course not.

21:33.730 --> 21:35.980
What do you think
you're gonna find there?

21:36.510 --> 21:38.650
It's just protocol.

21:38.950 --> 21:40.520
Excuse me.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.750
What is he not telling us?

21:49.030 --> 21:52.190
The clasp is damaged,like it
was ripped off of her neck.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.780
Then they tossed it in the trash.

21:53.790 --> 21:57.130
If the abductor just wants to fulfill his
urge and move on,he wouldn't take the time.

21:57.140 --> 21:59.330
This is motivated by
rage. It's personal.

21:59.340 --> 22:03.430
David westerfield kidnapped danielle van dam
out of revenge when her mother rejected him.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.930
This may not be related to
last week's abduction after all.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.740
Somebody lit a fire last night.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.240
Well,there's dirty dishes
for 3 in the kitchen,

22:33.250 --> 22:34.910
So they eat together as a family.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.970
Hey,my favorite movie
from when I was a kid.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.250
So they watch movies together,too.

22:41.260 --> 22:45.300
By a fireplace in a house that's
in a cookie-cutter neighborhood.

22:45.310 --> 22:48.440
Norman rockwell couldn't
have painted this any cozier.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.520
That's what worries me.

22:53.570 --> 22:56.670
Is there anyone in your life
you would consider a threat?

22:56.680 --> 22:58.150
Why would you ask me that?

22:58.160 --> 23:00.460
We have to explore every possibility.

23:00.470 --> 23:01.410
I don't understand.

23:01.420 --> 23:03.740
Now you don't think it's
connected to the other case?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.640
We're not sure.

23:05.970 --> 23:08.300
Why would someone we know do this?

23:09.470 --> 23:11.330
Katie jacobs.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.870
I just have a couple of
questions I want to ask you.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.360
Are there any families in your
neighborhood that you don't get along with?

23:18.370 --> 23:19.540
My neighborhood?

23:19.550 --> 23:22.350
- Or an employee that you might have fired?
- No.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.210
- Or any child that katie
might have upset? - H-hold on.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.600
Where are you going with this?

23:26.610 --> 23:29.090
Katie's necklace didn't
fall off by itself,

23:29.100 --> 23:31.280
And it's possible that
she knows the offender.

23:31.290 --> 23:33.960
Ah,that's crazy. I
mean,w-why would any--

23:36.470 --> 23:37.560
no,no.

23:38.060 --> 23:39.910
We get along with everyone
in our neighborhood,

23:39.920 --> 23:44.360
And,uh,katie loves all of
her--all of her friends at school.

23:44.820 --> 23:47.530
I mean,I,uh--I taught
my daughter well.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.890
Why would you say,"i've
taught my daughter well,"

23:49.900 --> 23:52.150
And not,"we've taught her really well"?

23:52.160 --> 23:54.070
You know what I mean.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.490
Why are you looking at me like that?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.390
Are there marital issues
that I should know about?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.050
Are you kidding?

23:59.060 --> 24:00.420
Are either of you having an affair?

24:00.430 --> 24:01.900
You son of a bitch!

24:01.910 --> 24:04.520
- My daughter is missing,and you
wanna turn this around-- - I know that

24:04.530 --> 24:08.670
I'm concerned with finding her,which
is why i've asked you the question.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.860
My family means everything to me.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.000
Finding katie is everything to me.

24:23.900 --> 24:29.400
No,we are not participating
in any affairs.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.720
Ok.

24:37.390 --> 24:38.460
Katie jacobs.

24:38.470 --> 24:39.930
Katie jacobs

24:40.690 --> 24:41.500
Katie.

24:41.510 --> 24:44.270
Katie jacobs.Katie.Katie.

24:44.970 --> 24:46.960
Katie's been wetting her bed.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.970
A lot of 6-year-olds
do. Could be bad dreams.

24:51.980 --> 24:54.890
Some kids won't get up at night,'cause
they're afraid of the dark.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.360
Or it could be a lot
more complex than that.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.840
Most girls covet their dolls
like an extension of themselves.

25:07.220 --> 25:09.150
Reid,I know
these signs--

25:09.160 --> 25:10.880
acting out on her toys,wetting the bed.

25:10.890 --> 25:13.610
She's obviously covering up
something about that necklace.

25:14.490 --> 25:16.900
Is there something else?

25:18.100 --> 25:18.740
No.

25:18.750 --> 25:21.550
And her cousin might be
holding something back.

25:22.470 --> 25:26.260
Katie's in a lot of pain and not
telling anybody,and I think I know why.

25:29.750 --> 25:30.410
Yeah?

25:30.420 --> 25:34.400
Hotch,I think katie's being
molested,and we both know the odds.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.410
Most likely by somebody
under the same roof.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.080
Mr.Jacobs bought his
own daughter a necklace,

25:43.090 --> 25:46.660
Nobody would think twice about
that,so why would katie lie?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.450
She didn't...

25:49.030 --> 25:51.910
Because her father didn't
buy her the necklace.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.160
Get back here as soon as you can.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.960
We need to separate the boy
and his father,2 rooms. Now.

26:02.910 --> 26:04.450
Katie jacobs.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.610
Katie.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.230
No,sir.

26:11.030 --> 26:12.240
What's going on here?

26:12.250 --> 26:14.140
We're questioning
jeremy in another room.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.540
I know that. Why?

26:15.550 --> 26:17.700
We suspect that he may know something.

26:18.590 --> 26:19.540
About katie?

26:19.550 --> 26:22.690
From you,mr.Jacobs,we'd like
to know more about your son.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.630
What's going on?

26:34.210 --> 26:35.960
Did you find katie?

26:35.970 --> 26:38.020
Jeremy,how old are you?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.240
- 13
- 13

26:41.440 --> 26:46.300
You know,when I was 13,I was
starting to notice girls,too.

26:46.310 --> 26:48.820
I was
curious,but,uh--heh.

26:48.830 --> 26:50.920
I was--I
was,like,really awkward,

26:50.930 --> 26:53.980
So it was super hard for me
to talk to them,and I,uh--

26:53.990 --> 26:56.470
I Found that incredibly frustrating.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.260
Why are you telling me this?

26:58.270 --> 27:00.010
'C ause I think I understand you.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.310
You're,uh-- you're
in the arcade.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.300
Pretty girl walks in,and,uh...

27:04.310 --> 27:07.950
You get distracted by the--the
scent of her hair,right?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.690
I guess.

27:09.700 --> 27:10.700
So what?

27:10.710 --> 27:14.610
So you're-- you're
becoming a man. It's--heh.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.080
Believe it or not,it
happens to all of us.

27:17.090 --> 27:19.330
There's nothing wrong with that at all.

27:19.340 --> 27:20.720
Never said there was.

27:20.730 --> 27:25.910
And these video games that you
play,these cool video games allow you to,

27:26.200 --> 27:28.710
to explore your violent side. Right?

27:28.720 --> 27:32.030
So,I mean,clearly you're intrigued.

27:32.040 --> 27:37.320
My only question is whether or
not you acted on these curiosities,

27:37.330 --> 27:40.060
You've experimented yet.

27:40.070 --> 27:42.950
Shouldn't you be looking
for my cousin right now?

27:44.490 --> 27:46.410
I am looking for your cousin right now.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.840
Why are you asking me these questions?

27:48.850 --> 27:51.230
Why are you avoiding them?

27:53.860 --> 27:55.260
What would you like to know?

27:55.270 --> 27:57.240
What jeremy's interests are.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.660
Uh,computer.

28:00.670 --> 28:04.270
Likes to be on the computer.
Spends hours at a time.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.900
What's going on?

28:06.910 --> 28:08.500
Who does he socialize with?

28:08.510 --> 28:09.860
I don't know.

28:09.870 --> 28:12.540
Kids at school,I suppose.

28:12.810 --> 28:16.610
You live under the same roof,but
you can't name any of his friends?

28:16.620 --> 28:21.960
He spends hours in his room listening
to that metal music I don't understand.

28:22.550 --> 28:25.650
Has he always been this distant
with you,or is this something new?

28:25.660 --> 28:28.140
Well,I
guess--

28:28.480 --> 28:30.350
I guess it's always been like this.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.020
That's why I don't find it odd.

28:33.410 --> 28:36.050
Well,we did some checking,and,uh...

28:36.260 --> 28:39.910
We found out that jeremy,at
the ripe age of 13,has a record.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.910
For stealing,6 months ago.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.900
We knew that.

28:42.910 --> 28:45.460
And that didn't strike you as odd?

28:45.810 --> 28:48.700
He stole earrings for a girl he liked.

28:49.440 --> 28:52.530
When I was his age,I-- I
probably did the same thing.

28:52.540 --> 28:55.490
He must have really wanted
to make an impression on her,

28:55.500 --> 29:00.520
Make her feel special,because we checked
the record, And they were very valuable.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.750
We reprimanded him. What was her name?

29:03.760 --> 29:05.260
Who?

29:05.610 --> 29:09.420
The girl jeremy liked
so much he stole for.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.520
I--I
don't know.

29:11.530 --> 29:14.060
We're his parents. He's 13 years old.

29:14.070 --> 29:16.340
If he hadn't been arrested,

29:16.350 --> 29:20.500
We probably wouldn't even know
that he was interested in girls.

29:28.130 --> 29:29.530
J.J.,Can I get a minute?

29:29.540 --> 29:31.370
Excuse me. Where's my brother?

29:31.620 --> 29:32.950
He's being questioned,sir.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.840
About jeremy?

29:34.850 --> 29:36.410
You think jeremy knows something?

29:36.420 --> 29:38.420
We don't know the answer to that yet.

29:38.430 --> 29:39.880
Oh,god.

29:39.890 --> 29:41.470
Believe me,when we do know something,

29:41.480 --> 29:43.260
You guys'll be the first people we tell.

29:43.270 --> 29:45.660
W-we have to trust that.

29:47.450 --> 29:49.420
Excuse us.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.130
Well,that was strange.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.360
What?

29:57.110 --> 29:58.270
You would think during a time like this,

29:58.280 --> 30:01.100
Susan would wanna know why
her son's being detained.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.070
She didn't even look
to us for an answer.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.890
Look at her. She's
relaxed enough to sit down.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.400
Maybe protecting what
composure she has left?

30:12.730 --> 30:14.740
Or protecting someone else.

30:14.750 --> 30:17.500
Hey,jeremy,do you know
what I do for the fbi?

30:17.510 --> 30:18.320
No.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.510
Study human behavior.

30:20.520 --> 30:24.050
Like,uh,the way you're pushing
your chair away from me,

30:24.390 --> 30:28.340
It tells me that what I'm saying
is making you uncomfortable,like,

30:28.350 --> 30:31.000
Uh,you're trying to
distance yourself from me,

30:31.010 --> 30:33.830
Maybe from what I'm capable
of reading about you.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.210
Whatever.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.980
Case in point: You
bite your inner cheek.

30:37.990 --> 30:42.870
It's a-- it's a nervous tic,like
you're holding on to something.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.630
Doing it right now.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.390
You were also doing
it inside the arcade,

30:48.090 --> 30:51.170
And I think you were doing it
because maybe-- I don't know--

30:51.180 --> 30:54.260
Maybe you remembered something
more than what you told us.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.270
No. I told you everything.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.920
I don't know. I don't think
you told us everything.

30:59.930 --> 31:01.700
I think something else
happened inside that arcade,

31:01.710 --> 31:05.070
Something-- something you
haven't told anybody yet.

31:06.660 --> 31:09.240
Mr.Jacobs,have a seat.

31:15.220 --> 31:18.440
Did,uh,jeremy and katie
spend a lot of time together?

31:18.850 --> 31:20.940
Our families spend a
lot of time together.

31:20.950 --> 31:22.450
He likes his cousin.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.280
Does that make you jealous?

31:24.890 --> 31:26.270
What?

31:26.830 --> 31:28.640
Why would it?

31:30.420 --> 31:31.650
Why would it?

31:34.830 --> 31:37.500
We found that in the trash.

31:39.990 --> 31:45.580
How is it that you know your 6-year-old
niece likes to read books and play dress-up,

31:45.590 --> 31:47.920
But you don't know the first
thing about your own son?

31:47.930 --> 31:50.290
Typically molesters only pay
attention to the children that

31:50.300 --> 31:53.110
They're grooming,ignoring
even their own.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.480
Katie wore that necklace
because you told her to,

31:57.490 --> 31:59.760
Because you told her she was special.

31:59.770 --> 32:01.500
As if the sexual abuse wasn't enough.

32:01.510 --> 32:02.840
Is that when it started?

32:02.850 --> 32:04.710
- When what started?
- When you gave katie the necklace,

32:04.720 --> 32:06.140
When she started wetting the bed,

32:06.150 --> 32:10.160
When her parents came to you and susan wondering
Why their daughter locked herself in her room.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.940
Was that when it started? Is
that when the molestation started?

32:12.950 --> 32:14.430
This is ridiculous.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.900
Couldn't help yourself,could you?

32:15.910 --> 32:16.620
You're crazy!

32:16.630 --> 32:18.680
Like so many little girls before.

32:18.690 --> 32:20.230
- I--I wanna get outta here. - You
started spending more time with her

32:20.240 --> 32:21.950
and telling her she was special.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.490
- I'm not listening to you.
- You knew it was sick,

32:23.500 --> 32:25.070
- your brother's own daughter.
- Shut up!

32:25.080 --> 32:26.510
- Did she outgrow your preference?
- Shut up!

32:26.520 --> 32:29.200
- Did she get too old for you?
- No!

32:41.360 --> 32:42.820
No.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.940
I may have done some things that...

32:48.690 --> 32:52.330
You couldn't possibly understand,

32:52.690 --> 32:56.330
but I would never hurt katie.

33:12.310 --> 33:14.750
Whoever ripped the necklace
off katie did it in a rage,

33:14.760 --> 33:18.360
And he just seems... Broken.

33:21.540 --> 33:24.070
One minute,I'm having a
lighter engraved for my husband,

33:24.080 --> 33:28.400
And the next minute,katie's
name is being paged.

33:30.220 --> 33:32.610
You know,for probably the most
stressful day of your life,

33:32.620 --> 33:35.110
I haven't seen you light one cigarette.

33:36.170 --> 33:39.720
I quit over a month ago.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.900
You'd think after all
my years in retail,

33:42.910 --> 33:46.450
I'd hate the mall,but it was convenient.

33:52.860 --> 33:56.450
I don't think the aunt is telling us
everything,and this could get dicey.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.440
- Susan- -
what is it?

34:01.450 --> 34:03.240
- Uh,I need to speak with susan.
- Why?What happened?

34:03.250 --> 34:04.400
Did you find her?

34:04.410 --> 34:05.120
No. Not yet.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.730
- What--is it
about jeremy? - No.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.480
- Richard?
- I need to speak with you.

34:08.489 --> 34:09.440
Come this way.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.170
What are you doing? What's this about?

34:11.179 --> 34:13.219
You used to work in retail?

34:13.230 --> 34:14.630
I'm sorry. How does that-

34:14.639 --> 34:15.960
- should be able-
- I understand.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.570
You mentioned it earlier.

34:17.580 --> 34:18.449
So what?

34:18.460 --> 34:22.550
What you didn't tell me was you
used to work in this mall years ago.

34:23.290 --> 34:24.719
What does that have to do with anything?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.260
Susan,do you know something?

34:27.270 --> 34:29.949
You know this building
like the back of your hand.

34:29.960 --> 34:32.770
Earlier,you made sure to
separate from the group.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.070
Someone tell us something!

34:34.080 --> 34:36.030
What the hell is happening?

34:36.040 --> 34:38.170
God,susan! What do you know?

34:41.179 --> 34:42.639
- Oh,god.
- Come on.Let's go.

34:42.650 --> 34:44.870
- Susan,what- - what
did you do to katie?

34:44.880 --> 34:46.630
- Susan!
- What did she do?

34:46.639 --> 34:48.520
What did she do to her?

34:52.480 --> 34:54.210
What did you do with katie?

34:54.840 --> 34:56.790
Why would you ask me that?

34:56.800 --> 34:58.680
You and richard have been
playing the happy family,

34:58.690 --> 35:01.380
When the truth is you've been separated.

35:01.390 --> 35:04.190
Why else didn't you realize he hasn't
had a cigarette in over a month?

35:04.200 --> 35:05.950
He has no use for a new lighter.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.550
Richard and I have been
trying to work things out.

35:08.560 --> 35:14.600
Did you really believe that getting rid of
that little girl would take away his sickness?

35:16.770 --> 35:18.820
You're not making a bit of sense.

35:18.830 --> 35:20.940
Did it occur to you last week?

35:20.950 --> 35:22.160
After you saw on the news that

35:22.170 --> 35:27.310
A little girl was snatched from a
local mall and found dead 3 days later?

35:28.570 --> 35:30.940
There are 2 seasonal storage
closets at the end of that hall,jim.

35:30.950 --> 35:33.650
You check those. We'll
take the ones upstairs.

35:34.030 --> 35:36.580
Did you duct-tape her mouth,too?

35:36.590 --> 35:39.280
You know,if you do that to
someone with asthma,they could die.

35:39.290 --> 35:41.630
But I guess you already
figured that out.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.730
This was not supposed
to happen to my family.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.290
It didn't just happen,susan.

35:45.300 --> 35:50.260
You took her,a 6-year-old
vulnerable child who trusted you,

35:50.270 --> 35:52.170
who trusted your husband.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.850
You need to tell me where she is.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.880
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:06.850 --> 36:09.530
This is how katie sees herself,

36:10.290 --> 36:15.480
self-loathing,dirty,disgusting.

36:16.290 --> 36:19.460
- That is what your husband made her feel.
- No.

36:19.670 --> 36:21.580
Those nights that she
would stay at your house,

36:21.590 --> 36:25.140
He would sneak into her room
and tell her not to make a sound.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.240
No,please don't do this.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.530
Do you have any idea how
terrified she must have been,

36:29.540 --> 36:34.480
How confused,while you lay
awake protecting an animal

36:34.490 --> 36:37.810
Who will always have
those urges and always has.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.350
Don'T. Please don't.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.450
There's nothing left
for you to protect,susan.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.000
Instead of shielding her from more pain,

36:44.010 --> 36:45.820
You blamed her for your own.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.540
No,no,no.

36:47.550 --> 36:48.510
Yes,you did.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.660
You have robbed katie of her childhood,

36:50.670 --> 36:53.440
Are you gonna steal the rest
of her life from her as well?

36:53.450 --> 36:55.570
No! Enough!

36:56.430 --> 36:58.660
Where is she?

37:09.270 --> 37:10.980
Katie! Katie!

37:10.990 --> 37:13.760
Pick it apart,guys--
every box,every shelf.

37:13.770 --> 37:14.380
Katie!

37:14.390 --> 37:15.290
Katie!

37:15.300 --> 37:16.390
Katie!

37:16.400 --> 37:18.080
This whole pile back here.

37:18.090 --> 37:19.840
I need 2 guys in this aisle.

37:19.850 --> 37:20.790
Check up in here.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.300
Jim,why don't you check this room.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.030
Katie!

37:26.040 --> 37:27.960
You guys,in this room. Let's go.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.070
Katie!

37:29.080 --> 37:32.130
Katie!

37:32.320 --> 37:34.290
I got her! I got her!

37:40.140 --> 37:42.130
Hey,we need a medic.
Somebody move.Let's go.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.640
I can't feel a pulse.

37:43.650 --> 37:45.430
Tip her head back,open her airway.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.310
Ready? 1,2...

37:55.020 --> 37:56.660
Come on,katie.

38:16.540 --> 38:17.520
Katie!

38:17.530 --> 38:19.730
Come on,sweetie. Come
on,sweetie.Wake up.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.680
Is katie gonna be all right?

39:46.010 --> 39:47.870
She will eventually.

39:56.670 --> 39:59.070
I heard her call my mom's name.

40:00.190 --> 40:02.780
That's what I remembered before.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.500
We get it,kid.

40:06.510 --> 40:08.090
That's your mom.

40:12.820 --> 40:15.030
What's gonna happen to me now?

40:15.330 --> 40:17.610
I don't know,jeremy,but,uh,

40:17.620 --> 40:20.640
We're gonna make sure
you're all right,ok?

40:24.960 --> 40:26.080
Let's go.

40:30.900 --> 40:32.840
Susan consoling katie's mother,

40:32.850 --> 40:35.230
That's an image that's
gonna haunt me for a while.

40:35.690 --> 40:39.640
Well,we could have been
left haunted by a lot worse.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.160
Thing is there's still a guy
out there who hasn't been caught.

41:12.590 --> 41:13.950
I know.

41:14.990 --> 41:17.050
And there always will be.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.250
But today we made a difference.

41:20.700 --> 41:23.030
Tell you one thing,if
I had a kid back home,

41:23.040 --> 41:25.280
I wouldn't still be standing here.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.810
I'll see you around.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.460
Take it easy.

41:36.820 --> 41:39.030
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

41:47.930 --> 41:49.750
He's asleep.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.530
Just 5 minutes.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.370
G.K.Chesterton wrote,

42:16.750 --> 42:20.040
Fairy tales do not tell
children that dragons exist.

42:20.590 --> 42:23.360
Children already know
that dragons exist.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.320
Fairy tales tell children
that dragons can be killed.
