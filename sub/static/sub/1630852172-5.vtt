00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  Good afternoon,
followers! Gossip Girl here,

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
your one and only, etcetera,
amen. Oscar Wilde once said,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
"Give a man a mask,
and he will tell you the truth,"

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
which is why I love Halloween.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Because what was once created
to honor the dead

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
tends to leave bodies
in its wake.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
For when you don your disguise,

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
-the false sense of security
it provides...

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
-...always leads to loose lips
that'll sink both friends...

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
-...and relationships
before dawn's early light.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
-STUDENT 1: Come on, bring it!
-STUDENT 2: Fucking asshole.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
But I don't wanna spoil the fun.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
After all, the biggest scares

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
are the ones
you never see coming.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
-GOSSIP GIRL:

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
dead or alive.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
That might have been
the best one all week.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
-We can't do it at school again.
-

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
-That's what you say every time.
-Yeah, well, if we got caught...

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Your generation always
feel so guilty after they come.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
-Hmm.
-So sweet.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'll see you tonight?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Inside my apartment
for a change?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Ah, you didn't like
the fire escape or the roof

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
-or the stoop, huh?
-Hmm.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
MONET DE HAAN: Hey, girl.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Hi.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
They always find each other,
like magnets.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Consider me on the other side.
Repelled.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
-Come on.
-So, where are we headed?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
-or Thai Diner?
-Did you forget our plans or--

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I actually have to go visit
my grandma.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
-You can come if you want.
-MONET: I was talking,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
right? Those weren't just voices
in my head.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, no because the voice
in your head

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
is probably screaming right now.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Why are you guys sitting
at this table?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I mean, they're-- they're all
the same tables.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
-The same table?
-The same table? Okay, now.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That, like everything
but your outfit,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
was carefully chosen.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
The way the light hits,
the proximity to the trash.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
The fact that people
have to uncomfortably

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
turn their head to the left
to take us on.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Hey, where-- where's the brooch
that we said we'd shoot you

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, do you mean
the Burmese ruby?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Do you know they're called
genocide gems?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Hmm. Who told you that?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
If Z had done her research,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
she would know that Cartier
doesn't use Burmese rubies.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
So there goes
that sponsored post.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We could just hang around
the Shibui pool.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
You two have been spending
an awful lot of time together.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah. Well, Julien
is on a mission

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
to show everybody
that we really are friends

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
and what she said
at my birthday party wasn't just

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
some publicity stunt
to boost her followers.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Which worked, by the way.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
So, what are we doing
for Halloween?

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
I was thinking you, me, and Obie
could do something together?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Someone will definitely take
a photo, and there's

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
to prove that things are great
between us than a group hang.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Hashtag Disney+.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I kind of already agreed to go
with Obie

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
to this party one of the witches
from  Hocus Pocus  throws.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Oh, um... Hulaween.
How could I forget?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'll just hang out
with you girls.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
If you mean to Hulaween,
then yes, of course.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
This year's theme
is New York Legends.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
If you're not there,
you're basically admitting

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Plus, this is the first
Halloween post-COVID.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
So you're still defined
by that humiliating loss

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
to Pippa Sykes and Bianca Breer
from the year before.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Who?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Two bland girls
from another school

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
that want what JC has,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
except they're always too busy
fucking each other's boyfriends

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
-and pushing each other
into fountains...

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
...to get after it
and honestly, it's so basic.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
-They might as well be bots.
-

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
-But we still have to beat them.
-A couples contest?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Isn't that kinda middle school?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Like, what, do you get a trophy
or something?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
A trophy? No, try your photo
on the landing pages

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
of the holy trifecta:
Vogue, Harper's,  and  WWD.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Add Miss GG to that mix.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
ZOYA LOTT: Obie
never said anything

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, no need to worry,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
'cause, uh, Aki and I
are gonna win.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
We have picked the perfect
New York legends,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
-Greta and Noah, yes.
-JULIEN CALLOWAY: Ooh.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
-LUNA LA: Ew.
-And unlike them at the Oscars,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
we will not be going home
empty-handed.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
So you and Aki...

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
We are figuring things out,
slowly but surely,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
and, uh, with no interference,
and that's what counts.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah. You need to think
of something great, JC,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
because you can't lose again.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, how am I supposed to do
a couples costume by myself?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Couples are a dead binary.
Be Rihanna or Oprah.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
They don't even need last names,
let alone a partner

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
AUDREY HOPE: Why is everyone
on their phones?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
-MONET: Hey.
-You guys see what happened?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Some kid brought a gun
to school.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
-Holy shit.
-You're back on Insta?

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
MONET: Oh, my God! Of course,
it's Pippa and Bianca's school.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Now they're gonna get
the sympathy vote.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
PIPPA SYKES:
Can you believe it?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
My entire life flashed
before my eyes.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
-Like, all 16 years.
-Right in front of us.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I didn't wake up today
thinking I would be a hero,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
but when I screamed
and everyone ran--

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
PIPPA:  Love each other.
Life is precious.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Join us on Clubhouse
where we talk trauma.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
-Invite only.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
You need to take those barely
sentient succubi down

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
before they wind up
on  This American Life,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
because you can't compete
with that.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
So, what are you gonna do?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
You guys, a kid brought
a gun to school.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Doesn't that make
a costume contest

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
-seem a little frivolous?
-Or a good way to process.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
-MONET: Hmm.
-Maybe this is the year we forgo

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Hey, we don't have to go
if you don't want to.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
I mean, I wanna go, it's just
the dressing up part.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Do they know why he brought
a gun to school?

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Gossip Girl, of course.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
-Nice to see you all.
-

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
MAX WOLFE:
Some more than others.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
If I didn't know any better,

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I'd think you've been
avoiding me.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Seems you know pretty well, huh?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
We're gonna be late
for practice.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Remember? My dad and I
are gonna go see my grandma.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Hmm. Dumbo Hall later?
Most of us.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
What did I ever do to you
that you didn't ask for?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
-Give us some space?
-MAX: Ah.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
So that's how it's gonna be.
Okay. So, wait,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
you fucked up fucking me
and I get the shaft?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
We apologized to each other,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
but you don't think you did
anything wrong.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
See, that's your thing, Max.
You never do anything wrong.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
You're all id all the time,
and, honestly,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
-my ego is just exhausted by it.
-Aw.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay. Well, look, don't worry,
you can rest easy now.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Messy Max
still in effect.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Seems to be back to normal
to me.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
-Hmm.
-

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
-Do you think...
-Hmm.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I don't think,
because I don't care.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
TV ANCHOR:
And while what happened

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
may have been a tragedy avoided,
authorities remain on alert

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
as we move in
to Halloween weekend.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Dr. Nan Barchek is with us,
a child psychologist

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
here to talk about how parents
can be more mindful

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
of the role
sites like Gossip Girl

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
and Discord play
in their kids' life.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
-Dr. Barchek, thanks for coming.
-This is our fault.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
My sources say that
that student's family

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
are big game hunters.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Like, they showed up strapped
to Christmas Mass.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
We're not responsible
for what every disturbed kid

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
We are when that kid
was targeted

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
in Gossip Girl-tagged photos.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
We inadvertently created
a platform for his bullies

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
to publicly humiliate him

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
and a forum for them to go off
in the comments.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
We can't control who tags us
and what they write

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And it's because of Gossip Girl
that they were able to identify

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
what happened and who was
behind it. In a way,

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
we're kind of heroes.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Okay, fine. Antiheroes,
like Batman.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Just because it ended well
this time

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
doesn't mean it will the next.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I mean, don't you worry if we've
been too hasty on all of this?

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
-Too rash?
-Define "all this,"

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
many rash things: taking photos
of undressed teenagers

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
from outside their window,
getting our friend fired?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
It started out as a small,
in-school social experiment.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
But it's become
a citywide enterprise

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
that needs someone
to constantly babysit it.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't feel right
about it anymore.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Wow, submits a story
to  The Paris Review  once.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
This has nothing to do
with whether or not

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
This is about real lives
at stake.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We should take a break
from posting.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Seriously? Remember when you
couldn't take a day off?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Now you wanna walk away?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
JORDAN GLASSBERG: If this is
about finding extra time,

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Wendy and I can pick up
more slack.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
I think we proved ourselves
last time.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
It's not that.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
What we're doing
has consequences.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's best
we take a break,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
see if things cool off,
and who knows?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Maybe it existing
for that brief while

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
-made a difference.
-This isn't just your decision.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Sometimes even Batman
has to just be...

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Bruce whoever.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Regardless of what
Kate Jung Un thinks,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
we have a say in this.
And we can do what we want.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
-Wayne. Bruce Wayne.
-

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
-

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I lucked out, man,
everybody was slower today.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
-Everyone's on edge.
-Yeah.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
I wish Julien hadn't told Zoya
about the couples costumes.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Why?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Everything's good between them.
You can relax.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Maybe, uh, have a good time
with your girlfriend

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Okay, but see, you say
that word, and I'm like,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
"Okay, is she my girlfriend?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Or are we just two people
that meet up

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Dude, don't worry.
It's only been a month.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
-Things move slower
where she's from.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You and Julien
lost your virginities

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
no one even knew
it had happened.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, but I'm not even talking
about sex, dude.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's like when we first met--

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Thank you. When we first met,
she was so full of ideas

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and-- and thoughts
and we'd talk for hours,

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
and now, it's like...

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
It's like I just
monologue at her

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and then wait for her
to interrupt me.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
AKI MENZIES: Uh, maybe you're
afraid of it now that it's real?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
All the obstacles
that were in your way are gone.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And you finally have free time
to get to know each other now.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
-Which can be scary.
-

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Unless this is about Julien...

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
No one would blame you
if you still--

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
No, I like Zoya.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
It's just some growing pains,
that's all.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
No matter how many buses I'm on,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I can never really manage
to find my balance.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Uh, no, you're good.
It's my fault.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah. What's a Gossip Girl?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Hey, stranger!
Just creeping on my phone?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm sorry. I-- I don't really
have any phone etiquette.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
And it's, uh, it's mainly
because I only have one of these

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
in case of emergency.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So, you really don't read
Gossip Girl?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
SIMON RIVERA: No. And, uh,
no offense or anything.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
It just doesn't really
seem like my thing.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, you must not be from here.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No, I am. I actually, uh,
go to school near here.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Oh, I hope it's not the school
I've been hearing about all day.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh, man, are you okay?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
It was just pretty intense,
you know.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Uh, I just feel pretty bad
that I didn't, like,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
-see it coming.
-How could you?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Well, I'm on a scholarship,
like Jared is.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
And, uh, you know, at a school
like ours,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
that can either give you
a superiority complex

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
or add to you feeling different.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
And, you know, mix that in
with evil rich kids

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
that are exploiting that anxiety
and pushing those buttons

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
and using us
to make themselves feel better

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
about their privilege?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, I'm not that surprised
that it escalated.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
And if that Gossip Girl
is what it sounds like,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
you know, I imagine
that probably made it worse.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah. And I would be
the first person

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
So, why look at it?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I guess because everybody does.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Well, you know what? Uh, now
you know someone who doesn't.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Or you're getting to know
someone, at least.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Uh, Zoya Lott.
It-- It's nice meeting you.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I would keep talking,
but this is my stop.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Well, maybe I'll see you on here
again some time.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
-Hey!
-AUDREY: Hey! I'm just here

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I'll be going out.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Well, you gotta eat somewhere,
right?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm making miso salmon
and sushi rice.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
It's your favorite.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Why are you staring at me?

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
I don't remember the last time
you cooked anything.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
I cooked last Christmas Eve,
or the one before that.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
-Um, I'm not that hungry, but...
-Oh.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
...I guess I should be happy
that you got out of bed...

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
even though you didn't bother
to shower.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Um, I'll have leftovers
tomorrow.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
-Um, actually, honey, I...
-What?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I-- I need to talk to you
about something.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Um, I have some news.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Um... We are going to have
to move home.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
-We are home.
-No, to Cornwall.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
That is not my home.
That's your home.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And after way too many years
being stuck in that place,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I am never going back there.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Plus, Cornwall is two hours
away. I can't comm...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh. You wanna pull me
out of school too.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
-Yes, Audrey.
-

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
you didn't actually
make me dinner.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Of course not.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
It's never an honest gesture
with you.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Just another selfish act.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
You know what? I thought I would
do something nice for you,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
but you're right,
there's no point.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
-I have a migraine.
- Wait! Just--

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Why don't you just
sell the other house?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Because it wouldn't even cover

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
the cost of the maintenance
here.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
This is not up for discussion,
okay?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I don't have a job,
we have debt.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
-We don't have a choice.
-It's not "we" anything.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
I had nothing to do with this,
okay?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I am not going anywhere.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You can figure something out.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
If you have to design
headbands at an airport kiosk,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
so be it.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
It was absolutely ridiculous.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
And then she just left me
standing there

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
like I'm supposed to be happy
to play Little Edie to her Big

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
in some sad suburban shanty.
It's--

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
AKI: Shanty?

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
-It's on five acres.
-That is not the point.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I just feel like things
are finally getting back

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
to normal around here.
I'm not going anywhere.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Plus, the only reason
that Connecticut even exists

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
is to create landmass
between Boston and New York.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
-Yeah.
-Yeah, hmm.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
BY PAUL MCCARTNEY AND

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
-Did you just text me
angry cat emojis?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Can you please focus
on possibly losing me forever

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
instead of already looking
for someone better?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
And you have a right
to be upset with Kiki,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
but I think it's unfair
to label her financial issues

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
-as a minor setback.
-Wow.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Aki taking both sides again.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
What a refreshing
change of pace.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
Hey! He isn't here, Akeno.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Another DM in distress
to your account, JC.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Gaten Matarazzo says,
"I know what it's like

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
to have to pretend to get along
with your co-stars.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I understand why you're doing
the same with your sis. Hearts."

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't even know him.
Ugh. I just don't understand.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
When I told my fans that
that apricot scrub

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
sales plummeted 30 percent.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
How is it I can't even
convince them

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
I'm friends with my own sister?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
MONET: Hate to say this,
but you lost credibility

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
the second you took your finger
off your apps.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
If you want people
to listen to you,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
you need to remind them
of the JC that they listened to,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
which means no more
no-phone zone.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
No more filter-free
once-a-week post.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Full-on, full-time, Julien.
That's how.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Let us do our jobs again?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
-JULIEN: Stay Zoya-friendly.
-I like a challenge.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Yay! You're here.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
MONET: Great.
Just in time for shots.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Nothing says sisterhood
like an All Hallows pre-game.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
-LUNA: I'll get the mezcal.
-MONET: Mm-hmm.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Get the whole bottle.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
...you remember that article
I mentioned on deforestation

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
and how it, like,
affects public health?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, the professor's actually

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
at Columbia, and I thought
that maybe we could go.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It's cool. It's, like--
It's about, you know,

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
from wildlife preserves and just
got me thinking that, um...

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You know what? This can wait.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
How was your day?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
The strangest thing happened.
I was on a bus,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
and I started having
this convers...

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Can we not?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I mean, in front of Julien?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
-Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
-

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I have to pee.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Hey! So, you know

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
when you manipulated your dad
to give up his entire life

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
to move to New York for you,
how did you do it?

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
A lot of it had to do
with how much better

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Ugh. Stop, this is not gonna
help me.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
ZOYA: Also, he grew up here.
He knew the city.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
All I had to do was remind him
what he liked most about it.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm gonna go get a--
get some more tea.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
-Do you guys want anything?
-Um-- um, yes, please, actually.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
-Hello?
-Mr. Wolfe, it's Aki Menzies.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
I'm trying to reach Max,

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
but he's not answering
his phone.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
GIDEON WOLFE:  Aki, hello.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
He hasn't been home
much all week.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Has he not been with you?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
because of his father weeping
in the guest room most nights.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
But he finally moved out today.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And so the only one
weeping here is me.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Sorry to hear that, sir.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
GIDEON:  Polite as always.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
If you see my son,
let him know the coast is clear

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
for his return.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
AKI:  Of course, Mr. Wolfe.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
-Hey.
-Oh, Zoya, hey!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
ZOYA: I'm shocked
to see you here.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I didn't think this would be
your kind of place.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
It's not. No. Uh...

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I actually just had dinner
with my investment banker cousin

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
who, quote, "Only dines
at members-only."

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I see that and I raise you
an influencer sister

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
who drags me here every day.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
-Oh. Really?
-Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
We're, uh, sitting over there
if you want to join.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Uh, no offense or anything,
I just kind of want to leave

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
as soon as possible.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I get it. I'm only here to be
on display for her

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
"Halloween is for family"
campaign.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Okay.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Well,
would it be presumptuous of me

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
to maybe give you
my phone number?

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
I just feel that it's,
you know, important for

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
-you know, stick together.
-Uh, I'm-- I'm actually, um--

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
No, wa-- wait, I don't--
I don't mean it like that

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
It's just, uh... a kid brought
a gun to my school today.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And it's just that, you know,
it's got me thinking that,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
you know, life, it's--
it's too short.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I mean, not to hang out
with people

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
that you really connect with.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Right. Yeah. Of course.
Why not? All right.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
Okay. So, great news.
Brilliance has struck,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
and I have the perfect plan
to get my mom here.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
-That's awesome.
-AKI: That's great, babe.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Hello? What are you guys
looking at?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Who's the hot guy?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Guess who was at the bar
with a gaggle of hangers-on,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
-rehashing their brush
with death?

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Bianca was apoplectic
so I love that.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
There you are.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
We need to coordinate
our Sister Assault

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I wanna do fall colors
in the morning and then--

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
What if we did
a couples costume ourselves?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Us, together?
Like the Kardashians?

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh, um, why didn't you guys
think of that?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Um, because the Kardashians
aren't even

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
And because your brand
is singular, not plural.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
-You do this on your own.
-Z, I thought that,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
you know, I thought
that we're pairing up?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
You said you didn't want to.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
-My friend, Simon, had the idea.
-Wait, Simon? That's the guy

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
-that was-- that you were--
you were with?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Oh, yeah.
We were just talking.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I'm so in this with you.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Let's start
brainstorming sisters.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
-Uh, Jo and Amy.
-Ooh, Elsa and Anna?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
-Celie and Nettie.
-Katniss and Prim.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Uh, Cordelia and Goneril?

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
-The Lohans, two Lohans.
-ZOYA: Elena and Lila.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
-All of the Olsens.
-LUNA: This is a joke, right?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
If I have to go along with this,
you do too.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
-We'll find the right look.
-So stoked.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
-PIPPA: Ooh.
-Ugh, God.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Wow!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I didn't know people
from Constance

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
even knew about this place.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
-Did you hear
what happened to me?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Do you mean what happened
near you?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Do you know what else
will be happening near me?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
-The press crowning me winner
when I show up to Hulaween...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
-...with the perfect costume.
-...umes.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
That'll pale in comparison
with ours.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Because we have a better story.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
Blood being thicker
than Franzia, after all.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
-I'll see you from the dais...
-

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
...whoever you are.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
JULIEN: Well,
that deserves a drink.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Hmm?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Ladies...

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
GOSSIP GIRL:  Spotted. We
never could have predicted this,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
-but looks like JC and Z...
-

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
...really have buried
the hatchet.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Too bad Z buried it
in Obie's back.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
AKI: Remember when I said
not to worry?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
-I think you should worry.
-

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Why are you WhatsApp-ing me?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Because I wanted you to see
how angry I am.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
We said we would stop posting.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Technically, you said
we would stop posting,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
but then we got a photo
of Zoya and that rando.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
And then this photo,
Obie alone,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
sadder than sad Keanu.
How could we not post it?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
I was just making a meme.
Here's Lobie eating pie.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Here's Lobie on a horse.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Here's Lobie
with Bernie Mittens. And--

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
-Please just stop.
-

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
-Hello.
-Ms. Keller? Kate?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Uh, sorry.
Now is not a good time.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Uh, it's Nick.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Oh, hi. Uh, how did you, um--

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
NICK LOTT:  Uh, it's on
the emergency phone tree.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I hope you don't mind me
calling.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
You know, I saw the news
this morning about that kid

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
at the other school and well--

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
KATE KELLER:  Did Zoya say
anything about it?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Uh, people are blaming
this Gossip Girl.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I know they've talked
about Zoya, too.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Actually, I was thinking
you could ask her.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Yeah, back in Buffalo, she was--
just so focused on school.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Always the extra credit kid.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
And now she's going out
all the time

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
with her sister, boyfriend.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
And my mom suggested
that I get a tutor.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
And, you know, just to get Zoya
back on track.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
And as you're
her favorite teacher,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I have been wanting
to get more involved at school.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
What are you doing
after school tomorrow?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Tomorrow? Um, nothing.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
For fuck's s--

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Tried you a few times
last night.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Phone's on "do not disturb."

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
You and your dad
must be pretty broken up

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
about your Pops
leaving the house, huh?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
We're gonna be late to class.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
-Said you never.
-What is this, huh?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm doing great
for the first time in weeks

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
with just my own chemistry
and you're draining my dopamine.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Maybe there's a teacher
you can fuck to get it back.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Oh, okay. I see.
So this isn't a haze,

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
it's a visit
from the purity police?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
This can ruin his career, Max.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
This can follow you around
forever. For life.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, uh, if you want me
to stop so bad...

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
you can always make me.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
I'm just trying to be
your friend here.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
No, but you're not my friend,
Ak. Are you?

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I'm just someone you can project
your fantasies onto.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And now that your girlfriend
wants me out of the picture,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
you've realized how bored
and basic you are without me.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
And that's not my fault.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
You tell a single soul,
what you know...

23:18.000 --> 23:30.000
and what I do to you next
will be.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, um,

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I just-- I can't hang out
after school.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
My dad got me into some sort
of tutoring session.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Well, for the next half hour,
we're your tutors, got it?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Why are we doing this?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
She should just do her thing
with Obie

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
and you should do yours, alone.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
LUNA: The sister thing is cute.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
It's only cute
if the idea is cute.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
JULIEN: The costumes,
they can't just be cool.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
They have to tell a story.
Specifically, our story.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
Taking control of the narrative
is about owning the accusations.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
We should play into what people
are saying about us.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
So, do a legendary rivalry?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
-Exactly.
-All right.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
Wink at the rumors
while also putting them to bed.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
What if we did
SJP and Kim Cattrall

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
or-- or Keke Palmer
and that man?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
-Bey and Solange.
-Oh, my God. Duh!

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Wait! But they're not rivals.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
-They're really close, right?
-Are they though?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
I mean, they are sisters
in the same field, right?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
And the world is constantly
trying to see

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
-what's up between them,
so it's perfect.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
That's exactly our story.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
This is gonna be
our defining moment.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Okay. So obviously,
you're Beyoncé.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
-Lemonade  or  Homecoming?
-Hmm. Too expected.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
What about one of
the royal looks

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
JULIEN: Yes!

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
You, guys, if we want
really good attention,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
we do the elevator.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
-Good idea.
-Sister sticking up for sister,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
And we know
you look great in orange.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Yeah, because buffalo wings
or Buffalo Exchange?

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
-Yeah. Got it.
-

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
-Um, hey, that's my phone.
-LUNA: I found the guy

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
when you lied
about texting your dad.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Too bad he's private.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Is that the guy from last night?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Simon Rivera, yeah.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Are things that bad with Obie?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
No. Uh, it's kind of nice
to have a friend of my own

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
And Simon and I have a lot
of things in common.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
You and Obie have similar
interests too, right?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
It's just sometimes I wonder
if he actually

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
cares about the things
he talks about

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
or if he just thinks
that he's supposed to.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Like why go to a talk

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
if you could just
do something, you know?

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
I, uh, I gotta get back.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Send me your sizes, we'll do
a fitting tomorrow morning.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
-Bye.
-

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
You just missed her.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, I see that.
I came looking for you actually.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I need your help.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I wanna know what's going on.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
His name is Simon Rivera,
and that's all I know.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I'm sorry, Obie.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Don't be. I'm not.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Hello, yes, this is Otto
and Helena Bergmann's son.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Yes, Obie, that's right.
I was hoping

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
that you could, uh,
maybe do me a favor.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
-AKI:  What's up, Audge?
-I was really counting

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
-after school.
-AKI:  I know, it's just--

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
You know when something's wrong,
and you know you can't fix it,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
but you have to
see it through anyway?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
You mean like this conversation?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm just trying to stop
Max from making a mistake

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
that could affect
his life forever.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
-And then I'll stop by?
-No need.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I wanted a sous-chef,
not an extra guest.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Wish me luck, too.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
-

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I gather
this isn't a coincidence?

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
More like an intervention.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I was hoping I can convince you
to stay away from Max Wolfe.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
What are you doing here?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
He's 17, he's a student,
he's in one of your classes.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And no idea why you've decided
to talk about it here.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
What? Would you rather me
wait till he arrives?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
But you won't.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Because you already tried this
with him and it didn't work.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Or you wouldn't be here.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
I have an idea.
A photo of you two here.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Sent to Gossip Girl
for the whole world to see.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Here's what's gonna happen.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
You're gonna leave.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
And I won't tell Max
you were here

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
But if you ever try to say
or send anything to anyone...

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I'll tell everyone how wildly
inappropriate it was

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
that you hit on me.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
And after I said no, stalked me.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
And I had no choice, but to ask
your friend Max for help.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
From there, it's a pretty short
jump to suspension or--

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Hey, man, don't touch me!

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
-AKI: I didn't.
-Everything okay here?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
RAFA CAPARROS: This kid just got
a little too close.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
You might want to check his ID.
Pretty sure he's underage.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Don't worry. I'm leaving.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I know that everyone
just saw that.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
I've got witnesses
to back my story up.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Go home, Aki.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
And leave the adults
to make our own decisions.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
KIKI HOPE: Hey, Audge,
can you get that?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
-It's the doorman.
-Yep.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Ms. Hope, Ms. Lustbader

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
AUDREY: Ah, yes, send them up.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
What is this?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
-are on their way up now.
-Here?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
AUDREY: And Avery Thorne
and Angela Wilcox

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
are on their way.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
-Uh, why?
-And you love your New York

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
You just haven't seen them
in, like-- in, like, years?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah. We-- we fell
out of touch.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
Well, now you can fall back in.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Go brush your hair and change.
I will fend them off

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
with this divine relish tray.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!
Look cute, okay.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I just have to say,
it's really nice

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
to be here with you.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
I've been feeling a little lost
lately.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
But talking about literature
with someone who cares.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah, it's pretty easy
to get distracted, huh?

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I've been helping
this friend out with a project.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
And it's been more
time-consuming than I thought.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
Rewarding, but I'm worried
I only signed on

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
to distract myself from the fact

29:37.000 --> 29:42.000
that I wandered off my path
a little bit.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Well, tell me about this path.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
-Um, life lesson me up.
-

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
Before Constance,
I wanted to be writer.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
But my insecurities and fear
of failure got the best of me.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And, uh, I've been wondering
what would have happened

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
if I had just pushed
through them

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
and now I have this opportunity
to find out.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I've, um, I've submitted a story
to  The Paris Review.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
That's really exciting.
Well, when do you hear back?

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
No idea. But I won't let fear
overtake me this time.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
Um, I could use a little bit
of that fearlessness myself.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
Uh, the call I ignored,
it's this kid Simon.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
He is...

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
different than anybody else
that I've met

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
since I moved here.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
More like me, the me
I used to be, the me I was.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
And not like Obie?

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
Thing with Obie is,
when we first met, I thought...

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
he might be my people.
But how could he be?

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Sure, we have similar interests,
but where we're from,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
h-- the way we were raised,
how we see the world...

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
There's nothing wrong
with spending time

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
with someone you connect with.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Call him back.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
It doesn't have to be anything
more than a new friend.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Who doesn't want more friends?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Thank you, Kate.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
-Not so long, next time, okay?
-KIKI: Yeah.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
-I've missed you.
-Oh, I know, I missed you, too.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Everything has just been so--

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
But I-- I should've called
you back.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
-I'm so sorry.
-CELESTE: Don't apologize.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
What a rollercoaster
you've been on.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
KIKI: Yeah. Bye.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
-What is wrong with you?
-

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
KIKI: Why would you do
that to me?

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
What?
Surround you with your friends?

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
I was emotionally waterboarded
for the past three hours

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
between your father's affair
and-- and bankruptcy

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
The last thing on this Earth,
Audrey, that I wanna do

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
is relive that over and over
and over again.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
Can you hear how irrational
you sound right now?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
-Those are your friends.
-Yeah.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Who you made me debase myself
in front of all night long.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
I'm so, so, so sorry

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
-I tried to help you.
-No. No. Don't you do that.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Don't you make this about me.
This is about you.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
-Because you don't wanna move.
-You know what?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Maybe it was for me.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
Maybe somebody some time
has to do something for me.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I'm the one who cooks,
I'm the one who cleans,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm the one who makes sure
that you're awake and alive.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
No. I-- I gotta to lie down.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
-I can't do this.
-AUDREY: Oh, yeah.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
-That always works. Go lie down.
-You have no idea

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
You had no idea
what I have been going through.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
I am putting this apartment
on the market and that is final.

32:31.000 --> 32:37.000
Did dad say that was okay?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
What does he have to do
with any of this?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
He owns half of it, right?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Maybe I should call him,
ask him to buy out your share?

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
Audrey, p-- please.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Please don't involve him
in this.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Why? He actually cares about me.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
He wouldn't pull me
out of school

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
just because he screwed up
his own life.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You can live wherever you want,
Katherine,

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
but I am not going anywhere.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I would rather be alone
than live with you any day.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
-Fuck you!
-

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I hate you. I hate you!

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I can't thank you enough.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Hope we didn't pull you
from anything.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
An evening alone
at my apartment,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
over things beyond my control?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Zoya told me
about  The Paris Review.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
She's excited for you,
we both are.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Um, there's nothing
to be excited about.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm honestly just hoping
they can tell me

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
if I have a shred of talent
or if I'm a crazy person

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
for thinking that I do.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Not that I'd be able
to tell you,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
but I'd love to read it.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
You inspire my daughter.
I like to see what inspires you.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
-Uh.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
Um, why not?

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
-Uh, w-- what's your email?
-Uh, here. I'll just...

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I know what it's like to obsess
over something alone.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
You should have seen
this single dad

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
the first night his daughter
went out in the city.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
So, if you don't feel like
obsessing alone tomorrow,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
you're more than welcome
to come here, distract yourself,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
-hand out some candy.
-

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
-Oh.
-

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
KATE: Sorry.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
I have to go. There's, um, a--
a grading incident at school.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Goodnight.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
-GOSSIP GIRL:

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
for secret rendezvous.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
But looks like Z forgot
the most important part.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Her mask.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
And so this dynamic duo's
spotted again

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
hiding in plain fright.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Something tells us
this is going to cause

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
one monster of a scene
between her and Noble O.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Hmm. Looks like Z
should be playing Jay-Z instead.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
JULIEN: He's just her friend.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
She told me she
was hanging out with him.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Mm-hmm. Cool.
So, uh, give me your phone.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
-You're gonna like this post.
-JULIEN: What?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Hell no. I've never liked
a Gossip Girl post.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I'm not gonna start now.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
You said
he was just her friend,

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
If you want people to believe
that you and Z are close,

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
then you need to show them
that you support her,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
-no matter what or where.
-

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
If you won't stop,
I'll make you.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Wait, what happened?
Where did it go?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
-Interesting.
-You're good.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Someone probably dropped it.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
I wonder what Gossip Girl
is up to though.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
-Do I look all right?
-Are we going in?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
LUNA: You can't go in
without Obie.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
While it's too bad
he wouldn't go as the elevator,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
he can at least be the man
between you.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
That meta commentary will best
Pippa and Bianca

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
once and for all. I'll find him.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
What do you think
about GG going dark?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Do you think it had to do
with that gun thing?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Everyone's talking about it.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Whatever it was, I'm just glad
it happened when it did.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Do you think Obie saw
that photo?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
-Right, Monet?
-Hmm? Yes. Sorry.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I was just trying to see how old
Catherine Zeta-Jones really is.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
-What's up?
-Found, uh, whatever this is.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm Sinatra.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
Yeah

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
How are you?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I'm good. Yeah.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Should I not be?

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
-What's the plan?
-Okay. So give me your coats.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
There's a photo stop
just past the lobby,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
that's where it all happens.
And you know what,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
JC, you're gonna win this one,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
because no one's costumes
are better than these.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Wait. Is that...

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
What is happening?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
MONET: Oh, my God.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Someone must've leaked
your costumes, but, uh, how?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Someone must've followed me
to Mood

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
and saw me buy all that
Orange Sherbet

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, my God.
Pippa and Bianca, stunning.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
We thought about doing
something basic

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
like famous sisters, but decided
a metamorphosis was best.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.000
What bigger New York icons
were there

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
-than Serena and Blair?
-She means Blair and Serena.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Not only were we Gossip Girl's
biggest story today,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
we even killed her. RIP, bitch.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
So not only is she history,
but now we are also her history.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Best frenemies forever.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Oh, my God. The Twitter gays
are already on this.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
They're gonna win
the Hulaween again.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Move. Don't let anyone see you.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
-Go.
-Go.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
SINGER: Come on, y'all.
Y'all ready to party?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
-SINGER: Yeah.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
Mine, mine, mine

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
The things you do

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
No, no, no, no, no

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
Runnin' 'round

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
I just can't stand it

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
I put a spell on you

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh, yeah

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
AUDREY: I don't wanna leave.
And I don't know what to do

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
-and I'm just--
-I'll be right back.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Please hurry because whoever
is dressed as Bruce Willis

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
has been giving me the eye
for a half hour.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
That is Bruce Willis.
Hurry faster.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Instead of following
my dick appointments

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
why do you not get
one of your own

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
or is that against her rules?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
AKI: Yesterday, I was worried
about you being together.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
But after talking to Rafa,
I realize he's just bad.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
You know I'm on top, right?
Nagging does not turn me on.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
He's not a good guy, Max.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
Whatever you think,
you don't know what I've seen.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
At least not yet.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
-I care about you.
-MAX: Rafa cares about me, dude.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
You know nothing about him.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
He-- he's had a hard life.
His family disowned him,

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
he's got no one and I wanna fill
that void, okay?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Now, if you don't mind.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
AUDREY: There you are.
Did you see...

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
-Okay, she saw.
-JULIEN: Can you believe it?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Pippa and Bianca
disparaging our costumes.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
-Somebody told them.
-What are we gonna do?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Guys, it's just a party,
all right?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
They're just clothes.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
For you they might be,
but for people like me

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
-this gets written about.
-For years.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
If you can't beat them,
destroy them.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Drive-by trip-splash
or full out “Carrie?”

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
You've got to be kidding.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
-They can't get away with this.
-They already did.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Their photos
already on  Harper's,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
and if Gossip Girl were active,
it would be there too.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
I have an idea.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Take off your clothes.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
-Excuse me?
-What? What-- What's happening?

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
-Do you trust me?
-I used to.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Can you help me with this?

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
You know, I came here
to tell all of you

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
that I might be leaving
all of this very soon.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
But I guess that can wait.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
-Okay. Cool.
-JULIEN: Can you get Aki

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
I need his clothes too.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
-Hey, hurry up. Get undressed.
-Uh, can you, um...

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I guess this was bound
to happen eventually.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
I just assumed
it would be behind a paywall.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Hey, oh, no. Keep that on.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
Are you gonna clue us
on the plan at some point, JC?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
No.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
There are spies everywhere.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
They're next in line. Hurry. Go.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
JULIEN: Go. Go. Go.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
-ZOYA: Our wives.
-Ladies.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
We've been planning
this group costume

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
with P and B since last year
and the pictures complete.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
I'm Dan Humphrey and...

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
I'm Chuck Bass.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
What's gotten into you?

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
So, fine, they won't win,
but look at how cute they are.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Cute doesn't get you
on the cover of  Vogue.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
You'd be lucky
if he got you on PopSugar.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
BIANCA:
Why are you basic-bombing us?

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
You turned our frenemies
into common couples.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
JULIEN: Haven't you ever heard
of sisterhood?

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
If one of us goes down,
we all go down together.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
But why are you mad?

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
They would have
been nowhere before.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
Do you mean Pippa and Bianca
or our girls?

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
-

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Um, can I meet you inside?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
You keep popping
up where I least expect you to.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Well, I volunteer for the
New York Restoration Project.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
So, technically, I am working.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Well, um, I don't know
if you heard,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
but we crashed Gossip Girl.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah. She posted a pic of us
from yesterday

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
and it broke the internet.
She's gone.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
I admit, uh, you got me curious.
I-- I looked into her but...

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
what do you think it is
that she's actually trying

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
to do?

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
-You want to know?
-You know,

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
that you weren't interested
in her,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
and yet you keep
bringing her up.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
Must be something about it
that you find interesting.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Did you know
Mr. Caparros's cousins

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
have a winery in Argentina?

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
-I did not. No.
-Yeah. He told my mom about it

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
last year
at the St. Jude's fundraiser.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
-Okay.
-She bought a case to be kind.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
The wine tastes like shit,
but the website's actually nice.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
OBIE BERGMANN: Hmm.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
Why does it feel so good
exposing the truth about people?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It does, doesn't it?

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Hey! You found it.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
You gave me the address,
and I have a phone.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Right. Welcome.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Um, this place
has a great happy hour.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
It goes until 8:00.
I come in here like every night.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Everything on draft
is half price for Halloween.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
And I remember you saying
you don't like hops.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
So, I was thinking maybe
the pilsner?

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
-It's a microbrew from Vermont.
-Uh, I'm good with water.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Okay. They have that.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
-They also have wine.
-I'm sorry.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
I'm confused.
I thought we were meeting

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
to talk about the future
of Gossip Girl.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I'm sorry
if I gave that impression.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
You texted me, "We need to talk
about the future."

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
...uh, sure. Gossip Girl.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
You want it over, it's over.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
But if it is, I want to talk
about what might take its place.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
You-- you're not angry
that I shut it down?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I didn't agree to go
on this journey with you

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
because I thought
it was a great idea.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I did it because I like
spending time with you

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
and I was thinking
maybe we can--

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Yeah. I...

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
I get it.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
Um, Jordan, you are so sweet.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
Uh, you're one
of the only truly good people

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
-in my life, maybe the only one.
-

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
You need more people
in your life.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Uh, I really can't imagine

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
anyone else by my side
these last few months.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
-But the timing--
-Right. Of course.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
The-- the timing.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
I should go.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I'm supposed to help out
a friend pass out candy.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
That's cool. You need any help?

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
-I think we can handle it.
-

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Kate, I don't want Gossip Girl
to be done.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I've grown to like it.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Makes people talk face to face.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
It forces conversations
that would never be had,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
even this one.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
What you've done,
it isn't just important,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
it's vital.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Paris Review  be damned.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
-Thank you.
-

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I-- I really have to go.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Hey.
Why're you calling?

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
JC. I cornered Beyoncé
and made her sing like one.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
She confirmed my worst fear.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
The call came
from inside the house.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
-Meet me at the balcony.
-

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Sorry to interrupt.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
But I came across something
I thought you might like.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
-A photo from last year.
-

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Look at that,
photos of the family reunion

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
my cousins invited me to.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
My parents didn't speak
one word to me

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
and made a big show of leaving
shortly after I arrived.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Thanks for that memory.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Max, do you wanna dance?

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
Well, I'm not usually
into masked men,

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
but I'll take my chances
with you.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
LUNA: Monet de Haan,
I knew how low you could go,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
-but this is even further.
-I only stoop to conquer.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
And I would've
if you hadn't interfered.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
-Interfered? You sold us out.
-You sold yourself out

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
when you got mired
in your sister's shit.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Pippa and Bianca
are laser-focused

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
They're willing to do
whatever it takes.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And they listen
to their advisers,

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
which now includes me.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
They don't even go
to our school.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The world is bigger
than Constance, Julien.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
-I thought you were my friend.
-I thought you were mine too.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Which is why I put in all
of these hours to make sure

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
that you are the best.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
But when you abandoned all
of that

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
to waste your power
and your time

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
with that buffaloco
without even thinking

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
about how it would affect
other people,

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
I was done. After years
of doing your dirty work,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
you can't just decide
that you're clean

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
all of a sudden.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Luna may not care, but this--

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
I already have
an agent at LGA, so.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
But this is my future.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
If you can't roll
with your clients

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
as they change and grow,
what future will be there?

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I don't wanna do things the way
that we've always done it.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
I wanna be better.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Well, good luck on being better
without me.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Good luck to you too.
I wish you the best.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Where is Audrey?

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
She wanted to talk,
I shouldn't have ignored her.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Ms. Yuki?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Obie Bergmann.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
We met last year
at my mother's cover shoot.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Of course.
Nice seeing you, Obie.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
-Yeah. Nice to see you.
-You can call me Nelly.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
Oh, all right.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
-I'm a Soprano, yeah.
-

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
-You?
-Eva Chen.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Uh, she's down there somewhere
in tights being me.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
-I thought it'd be fun.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Now, why do we have you
to thank for the tickets?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Uh, my mom is stuck in Hamburg,

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
and she was so fond
of the profile,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
she just thought it'd be
a nice gesture.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I would love to introduce you
to my girlfriend.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
She's a huge fan of everything
you've done for the magazine.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
-Oh, of course. Thank you.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
And one of my teachers
was even fired

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
for submitting to her.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
-That was crazy.
-Yeah.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Well, that--
that is pretty crazy.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Uh, you know, I-- I wonder...

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
has anyone ever thought
that maybe...

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
you could be Gossip Girl?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Me?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
-Why?
-You're a student,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
just like Dan Humphrey was.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Writer like him,
an outsider like him.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
You can nail the voice,
not to mention

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
And...

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Gossip Girl was resurrected
right when you arrived

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
-and not a moment sooner.
-I...

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I don't understand.
You think I'm...

48:54.000 --> 48:57.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put you

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Um, you wouldn't want to go
get some fresh air real quick?

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
There's-- there's actually
a killer 99-cent pizza place

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
-down the block. This is--
-Oh, Zoya, there you are.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
I would like to
introduce you to my friend.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
-Simon?
-Ms. Yuki.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
-You know her?
-Of course he knows me.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm his boss.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Are you Chuck Bass?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Obie, what's this about?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Yes, can someone please tell me
what's going on right now?

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
Simon Rivera
is not a student anywhere.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
Simon Ravetch is a researcher
for  New York Magazine.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Isn't that right, Mr. Ravetch?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
I'll get us our table cards.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
-Victor.
-So, you called him after all?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
The masked man
you were grinding on in there.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
That's Rafa Caparros.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
No, it's not.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
I would know
those freckles anywhere.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
I used to trace them
with my tongue.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I told my boyfriend
that we didn't have a chance.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
-He still likes them young.
-Still?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
We fucked when I was a senior.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
That's his thing.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
I hope he'd grown out of that.
I-- I guess not.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
But has he taken you
to his parents' house

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
in Patagonia?

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
So that's when you know
you're really in.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
You've been impersonating
a student

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
because of Gossip Girl?

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
I was following a hunch
on who Gossip Girl could be,

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
all right? I began to think
that a Constance student...

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
this student was following
in Dan Humphrey's footsteps.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
This is better than I thought.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
-Obie, how did you even--
-OBIE: Oh, well, my-- my parents

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
leased Dumbo Hall,
the building it's in,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
so we're founding members.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
And the front desk told me
that Simon here was actually

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
a guest of Ben Peryer
from Condé Nast,

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
so I called him.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And he said that--
that Simon Ravetch

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
is actually a friend of a friend
who wanted to check

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
That he had his eye on
the front door the entire time

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
as if he were, and I quote,
"Looking for someone."

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Me.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Ben told me about how you worked
at New York.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
LinkedIn said you were
a researcher, so.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
-That's why you invited me here?
-Yeah.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
No story is worth
one's reputation, Simon.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Maybe a couple months
transcribing podcasts

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
for SB Nation will remind you
of that.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
This kind of drama is exactly
what Gossip Girl wants.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
If you stoop to her level,
Mr. Bergmann,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
you're no better than her.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Simon, let's go.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
You knew and you didn't tell me.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
You were excited to have
a new friend, but...

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
you gotta be careful, Z.
You have to be.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
People like that,
they will take advantage

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
to get closer to people like us.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
I'm not like you, Obie.
I'm outside your bubble.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Sometimes I feel like
you don't get that.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And other times, I worry
you get it too much.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
That I'm just charity,
another box for you

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
to check in
your performative solidarity.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
No, you are my girlfriend,
and I don't--

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
I just wish that you would act
like that sometimes.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
What-- what is going on with us
right now?

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
-Hey, hey.
-AKI: Are you drunk?

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I thought I was supposed
to be Greta.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
I'm here all night all alone
with no-- no friends, no family,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
no boyfriend.
What am I supposed to do?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Like, when am I gonna get a win?

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Audge, get a hold of yourself.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
You're acting like your mom
at your fundraiser.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You know what, I know why.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Because she wanted attention
from the people

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
that loved her most.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
And I didn't give it to her.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Just like you're not giving it
to me.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
I know everything sucks,
and it's confusing.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
I'm confused
about everything, too.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm changing, we're changing,
and we can't stop that.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
But we can work on how we react
to those changes.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
We can do better,
me, you, your mom--

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
It's my mom.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Now maybe you get to tell
your mom you understand

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
-a little bit better.
-Yeah.

52:58.000 --> 53:02.000
Hey, mom, I wanna say
I'm sorry that--

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Um, no. This is Dr. Gibson.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
I'm calling from
the emergency room

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
-What?
-So you're a liar.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Well, I only lied
about my parents

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
-to get you to talk to your dad.
-What about your students?

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
They were all legal.
Like you.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That's not the point.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Is this what you do?
A new student every year?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Not every year.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
-And you chased me.
-Hmm.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
Or did you forget?
This is still fun, Max.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
When did you get so moral
all of a sudden?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
ZOYA: Wait, Julien.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
-JULIEN: Okay.
-Did she say what happened?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
-JULIEN: I don't know.
-ZOYA: Come on.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
They don't care about you.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
If they don't, it's only
because I made it that way.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
-Hey.
-Let go of me!

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Here you are. All right.
Goodnight.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I think a Kit-Kat melted.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Hey, thanks again
for helping out.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I needed it.
It was great to take

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
my mind off things
for a couple of hours.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Not to put your mind
back on things,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
but now that the doorbell
is not ringing

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
I loved your story.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
-You did?
-I did.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
It was darker than I expected,
but evocative.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
I can see why Zoya
looks up to you.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
You're not only inspiring,
you're talented, too.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Thanks.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
I-- It's like
I hear you say that,

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
and it's so nice, but...

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I wonder if I've been
obsessing over the wrong things.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I wanted to be a writer
because I wanted

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
to make a difference
in the world, but...

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
what if what I've been doing

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
makes a bigger difference
than my writing ever could?

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
You mean teaching?

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
-It's really powerful.
-I think so, too.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
-Can I use your restroom?
-Of course, yeah.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
-It's just down the hall.
-KATE: Hmm.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
GOSSIP GIRL:
You thought I went somewhere?

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Well, I'm back.
And better than ever.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Yes, maybe I'd begun to wonder

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
if I was abusing
my considerable power,

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
when I realized you're the ones
who do that, not me.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
I'm not your parent,
your teacher, or your friend.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I'm your mirror.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I show you your bad parents,

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
your absent teachers,
your errant friends.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
But if there's one thing
this moment of reflection

55:28.000 --> 55:34.000
showed me, it's that this
isn't a place for you to speak.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm turning off the comments
from now on.

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
Mine is the only voice
you need to listen to anyway,

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
because if you were kinder
to one another, more honest,

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
if you had the hard
face-to-face conversations,

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
you wouldn't need me.
But you don't.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
You bring a gun to school.
You sneak out on your boyfriend.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
You hide behind your phones.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
So keep your masks on all year

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
-if you want to.
-

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
But know I'll be here
keeping count,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
keeping you in check,

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
reflecting what you refuse
to see is right in front of you.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
Hey, Nick, are-- are you hungry?
Uh, I know a good diner nearby.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
JULIEN: Everything Gossip Girl's
ever posted, it's all gone.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
What does that mean?

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
-MAX: Clean slate.
-God, I hope so.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
-Ms. Hope.
-

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Your mom's gonna be okay.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
She's awake but groggy.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
-Thank you so much, Doctor.
-I should warn you though.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
It's gonna be a very long
and hard road to recovery.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I understand.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
I'm not going anywhere.
