00:24.723 --> 00:26.003
Now that I have your attention!

00:26.633 --> 00:29.093
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a bank robbery.

00:29.556 --> 00:31.626
If I could please get
everyone on the ground,

00:32.240 --> 00:35.201
I assure you we will go
about our business quickly.

00:35.247 --> 00:36.001
You, get up.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.014
Please, don't!

00:38.700 --> 00:39.730
Not a word.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.635
Give me the bag!

00:42.436 --> 00:43.186
All right, people, you,

00:43.552 --> 00:46.051
I need you to fill that bag
with everything you've got

00:46.480 --> 00:48.784
or this poor girl's brains are
gonna be all over your floor.

00:49.013 --> 00:52.309
Ma'am, don't look at us.
Look at the floor, you'll live longer.

00:52.660 --> 00:53.678
Hurry up!

00:53.949 --> 00:55.932
Please, ma'am, just look at the floor.

00:57.886 --> 00:58.501
Michael?

01:00.486 --> 01:01.730
Is that you, Michael?

01:04.161 --> 01:05.492
Does Mom know what you're doing?

01:05.982 --> 01:08.014
Allison, what are you doing here?

01:08.763 --> 01:10.718
Is this your bank? You go to this bank?

01:10.998 --> 01:13.397
Yeah, it is, Mr. Tough Guy Bank Robber.

01:13.846 --> 01:16.437
You look stupid with
that thing on your head.

01:17.443 --> 01:19.315
Could you please not do that?
This is my work.

01:19.472 --> 01:20.516
I'm at work now.

01:21.254 --> 01:24.007
I know you're my sister, 
but show a little respect.

01:24.149 --> 01:25.849
I wouldn't go to your work
and make fun of you.

01:26.259 --> 01:27.072
I'm sorry.

01:31.427 --> 01:32.798
I loved the Christmas card.

01:32.981 --> 01:33.904
Thank you.

01:40.515 --> 01:44.435
Yeah. Those girls of yours, really grown up.

02:34.052 --> 02:35.709
Hey, baby brother, guess who.

02:36.081 --> 02:39.018
Haven't heard from you in awhile,
so I figured I'd give you a call,

02:39.456 --> 02:40.389
see what's up.

02:40.989 --> 02:42.753
Girls. Say hi to your Uncle Michael.

02:42.974 --> 02:45.476
Hi, Uncle Michael.

02:46.068 --> 02:49.530
Well, anyway, I'm at home right now,
but I'm leaving for work soon,

02:49.626 --> 02:51.725
so give me a call on my
cell when you get this.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.407
I miss you.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.066
Want to hear your voice.

02:59.663 --> 03:00.198
What?

03:02.244 --> 03:04.339
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Where could my brother be?

03:04.832 --> 03:07.431
Michael? Maybe sleeping it off.

03:09.847 --> 03:11.079
Look what time it is.

03:11.351 --> 03:13.542
What are we doing, guys?
Nobody's dressed. Come on.

03:23.010 --> 03:25.526
- Short day, huh?
- Armed gunmen at the Phoenix West Bank.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.416
I'll be back.

03:26.673 --> 03:27.395
Do you mind if I come along?

03:27.964 --> 03:28.971
Be my guest.

03:45.562 --> 03:46.730
Allison, you okay?

03:48.112 --> 03:49.079
You look like you've seen a ghost.

03:49.590 --> 03:52.252
Oh, sorry. This place just looks familiar.

03:53.636 --> 03:55.075
Maybe I've been here before

03:56.591 --> 03:59.768
Three males in stocking masks came
through the door at 8:37 this morning.

04:00.358 --> 04:03.419
They fired several rounds into
the ceiling to prove they were serious,

04:04.104 --> 04:08.330
then grabbed a female customer, and threatened
to kill her if the tellers didn't hand over the money.

04:08.829 --> 04:10.056
Did they actually shoot anyone?

04:11.832 --> 04:14.676
No, but they did take the female
customer with them when they left.

04:14.886 --> 04:15.884
Have we ID'ed her yet?

04:16.283 --> 04:17.091
We're working on it.

04:17.233 --> 04:20.704
The other customers describe her as a
Caucasian woman in her mid-20's, redhead.

04:24.954 --> 04:26.540
...know why they took her
out the door with them,

04:26.691 --> 04:28.433
but we're still hoping they let
her go somewhere between here

04:28.750 --> 04:29.570
and wherever they're headed.

04:29.862 --> 04:30.829
Did anyone actually...

04:31.551 --> 04:33.813
get a look at these bank robbers?
Did anyone see them?

04:35.459 --> 04:37.574
No. Like I said, they were wearing masks.

04:38.189 --> 04:41.089
So no one was killed, no one was
actually shot, here in the bank, I mean.

04:42.705 --> 04:44.334
For the second time, Allison,

04:44.833 --> 04:47.373
no one mentioned anything
about anyone being shot.

04:51.426 --> 04:53.366
Doesn't sound to me like you
have anything to worry about.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.829
How can you say that?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.385
It's easy, I just think it,
and it comes out of my mouth.

05:00.478 --> 05:03.792
Allison, you just finished describing
to me, in exhaustive detail,

05:04.119 --> 05:08.035
all the ways your dream is different
from what happened in real life.

05:09.191 --> 05:11.161
In real life, no one was shot.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.204
In real life, you were not there.

05:13.763 --> 05:16.234
And in real life, your baby brother

05:17.195 --> 05:20.583
is in sunny San Diego and
nowhere near Phoenix, Arizona.

05:21.653 --> 05:22.550
What are you worried about?

05:23.409 --> 05:24.745
Anyway, I'm at home right now,

05:24.887 --> 05:27.542
but I'm leaving for work soon,
so call me on my cell when you get this.

05:28.993 --> 05:30.862
I miss you. Want to hear your voice.

05:41.354 --> 05:42.310
Hey, barkeep!

05:43.402 --> 05:44.072
Hey!

05:44.924 --> 05:45.784
Sir!

05:48.433 --> 05:50.757
Hey, barkeepe, can I get a drink?

05:51.175 --> 05:51.921
One more beer please!

05:52.949 --> 05:54.158
Thank you.

05:56.341 --> 05:57.860
All  I want is one lousy vodka tonic.

05:58.982 --> 06:00.168
Hey, barkeep!

06:01.608 --> 06:03.425
One lousy vodka tonic.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.709
And put it on my tab.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.035
Funny.

06:10.759 --> 06:13.571
This is so not the sort
of place I normally come to.

06:15.719 --> 06:18.411
I'm not even sure I know
how I ended up here.

06:22.318 --> 06:27.089
So, now you know my sordid past.
Let's hear yours.

06:28.891 --> 06:32.566
Okay. Well, I, uh,
I growed up in the Midwest.

06:33.231 --> 06:34.610
I played some high school ball.

06:34.871 --> 06:38.034
Never made it to the college ranks,
because I had the grades of a cretin.

06:39.097 --> 06:41.627
I bumped around from job to job a bit.

06:42.457 --> 06:48.868
One night, I got really drunk with a bunch
of friends and woke up an enlisted man.

06:49.401 --> 06:50.221
You're a soldier?

06:50.706 --> 06:52.150
Was a soldier.

06:52.864 --> 06:55.693
Two tours in Afghanistan.

06:58.011 --> 07:00.100
Got back last winter, moved to San Diego.

07:01.024 --> 07:03.880
Oh, yes, people like me
have endless possibilities.

07:04.050 --> 07:06.374
If you're expecting an ambush, I'm your guy.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.526
Shooting, hand-to-hand combat,
peeling potatoes-

07:09.686 --> 07:11.657
oh, yes, I have an extraordinary skill set.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.919
Don't worry.

07:14.949 --> 07:17.284
I'm sure you'll find something.

07:19.437 --> 07:20.523
What?

07:22.346 --> 07:23.852
Come on, you were thinking
something. What was it?

07:25.652 --> 07:26.618
Just...

07:28.343 --> 07:30.632
I'm sort of having a little problem.

07:33.585 --> 07:36.203
An old boyfriend problem.

07:39.873 --> 07:43.214
Anyway... not important.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.832
It's a new day with new friends.

07:47.998 --> 07:48.870
Besides...

07:51.643 --> 07:54.017
probably not up for that sort of thing.

07:54.316 --> 07:55.660
What  kind of thing?

07:55.928 --> 07:58.349
This old boyfriend need
his potato peeled or what?

07:58.463 --> 07:59.560
Forget I brought it up.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.208
Back to you and your sordid life.

08:05.319 --> 08:05.939
Come on.

08:06.762 --> 08:08.312
What'd you do today, soldier boy?

08:08.600 --> 08:09.469
I mean, besides...

08:10.683 --> 08:12.789
arriving in Phoenix, Arizona.

08:13.615 --> 08:14.897
Hmm...

08:16.713 --> 08:17.944
I call front seat!

08:18.224 --> 08:22.424
You had it yesterday, doofus!
You can't call front seat two days in a row!

08:22.649 --> 08:24.937
- Can, too!
- Hey, no you can't!

08:25.147 --> 08:25.857
Hey, hey, hey.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.521
Bridgette, that's my seat!

08:27.639 --> 08:29.084
- Bridgette, come on.
- My seat. Bridgette!

08:29.213 --> 08:30.572
- No, no, no.
- Mine.

08:30.704 --> 08:32.072
Let's go. No touching.

08:42.245 --> 08:42.849
Mom.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.687
Mommy, is that Uncle Michael
in that car over there?

08:51.302 --> 08:52.274
Hang on a second, kids.

09:04.198 --> 09:04.857
Michael.

09:16.001 --> 09:19.137
Hey, Sis. Didn't order a wake-up call.

09:20.147 --> 09:21.021
What are you doing here?

09:21.592 --> 09:24.101
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

09:25.030 --> 09:27.754
Mom, is that him? Is it Uncle Michael?

09:28.353 --> 09:30.619
Can we stay home from school, Mommy?

09:34.199 --> 09:38.181
Well, you better wipe that look of horrified
disapproval off your face and give me a hug.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.910
Got impressionable young people watching us.

09:46.858 --> 09:47.829
Tell me you're okay.

09:48.746 --> 09:49.682
I'm okay.

09:50.428 --> 09:52.708
Tell me you have some idea
just how badly you smell.

09:53.963 --> 09:56.421
Hey, kids! Your mother's making fun of me!

09:57.350 --> 09:57.880
Michael.

09:59.771 --> 10:00.719
Sorry I didn't call.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.225
I was driving all yesterday,

10:03.512 --> 10:06.119
and didn't get into
Phoenix till around 10:00.

10:06.888 --> 10:08.379
You've been out here that whole time?

10:09.624 --> 10:10.582
I didn't say that.

10:11.469 --> 10:12.851
Last call was around 2:00,

10:13.065 --> 10:15.696
and I didn't feel comfortable
ringing your bell at that hour.

10:16.387 --> 10:19.728
But, also, I'm not sure I could've
found your bell at that hour.

10:20.505 --> 10:21.550
Wait a sec.

10:21.615 --> 10:25.357
Did I forget the part where I ask
if I can crash here for a couple days?

10:26.173 --> 10:28.009
- 'Cause if it's a problem...
- No, it's not a problem.

10:28.606 --> 10:31.400
I just... I need to drop the girls
off at school and day care.

10:31.549 --> 10:32.423
Why don't you come with me?

10:32.890 --> 10:36.013
I'll call in to work, I'll tell them I'm
taking a personal day, and we can catch up.

10:36.377 --> 10:38.162
Any other morning,I'd be all over that.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.707
But I've been dreaming about lying prone,

10:40.921 --> 10:43.252
not to mention taking a
crack at your indoor plumbing.

10:43.548 --> 10:44.378
Oh...

10:46.624 --> 10:50.579
Swear to me that you will take a shower
before you lay down on my couch.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.580
I swear on my children's lives.

10:52.816 --> 10:53.666
You have no children.

10:54.118 --> 10:57.762
But I-I want them. I want them desperately.

10:59.548 --> 11:01.200
All right, kids, I'll see you tonight.
Mind your mother!

11:01.861 --> 11:02.997
God knows she minds me.

11:04.010 --> 11:07.045
So he's in Phoenix, that still
doesn't make him a bank robber.

11:07.653 --> 11:09.327
I know that, it's just the timing.

11:09.587 --> 11:11.686
Showing up on our doorstep
the day after a robbery?

11:12.222 --> 11:15.194
Did I mention the enormous bag
that he pulled out of the back seat?

11:15.770 --> 11:16.967
Was it a burlap sack?

11:17.528 --> 11:19.694
Big black dollar sign painted on the side?

11:20.348 --> 11:21.169
No...

11:24.842 --> 11:26.024
Joe, I got to go.

11:27.866 --> 11:29.392
I'll call you back, I think something's up.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.943
Just got off the phone
with Detective Scanlon.

11:33.548 --> 11:36.407
He thinks we may have found our missing
hostagefrom yesterday's bank robbery.

11:37.671 --> 11:40.371
Two hikers found her in the desert
near Route 10 a few hours ago-

11:40.594 --> 11:41.942
stark naked, lying in a ditch.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.494
Coroner thinks she was
out there about a day.

11:45.624 --> 11:46.522
Right age, right build.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.994
But you're not sure?

11:48.518 --> 11:50.265
There's some confusion as
to whether it's really her.

11:57.557 --> 11:59.171
I don't understand. Does she have red hair?

11:59.892 --> 12:00.788
It's  a little hard to tell.

12:01.577 --> 12:04.332
Seems whoever killed her cut off
her hands and cut off her head

12:18.516 --> 12:20.148
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:24.630 --> 12:25.687
Well...

12:27.385 --> 12:29.460
I don't smell anything,
so it can't be dinnertime.

12:30.154 --> 12:32.477
No, it's early afternoon.
You want something to eat?

12:33.331 --> 12:33.835
Uh-uh.

12:44.707 --> 12:45.830
Forgive me for asking...

12:46.809 --> 12:48.160
but  what are you doing here, Mike?

12:49.814 --> 12:51.672
I mean, you're welcome to stay, but...

12:52.855 --> 12:55.719
This bag is big enough to hold
practically everything you own.

12:57.213 --> 12:58.819
So... are you visiting?

12:59.592 --> 13:02.071
Are you passing through?

13:05.815 --> 13:06.783
Are you hiding?

13:07.551 --> 13:08.908
You know me, sis.

13:19.915 --> 13:23.355
If I were to ask you, would you be
able to tell me exactly where you were

13:24.570 --> 13:26.966
at 8:30 yesterday morning?

13:30.454 --> 13:31.867
On the road coming here. Why?

13:32.488 --> 13:34.138
Did you stop anywhere along the way?

13:35.421 --> 13:36.235
Maybe at a bank?

13:38.371 --> 13:39.268
What? No.

13:40.076 --> 13:41.277
You need some money?

13:42.424 --> 13:43.387
You're positive?

13:44.170 --> 13:45.003
I'm positive.

13:46.464 --> 13:48.408
You want to tell me where
you're heading with this thing?

13:49.177 --> 13:50.694
I had a dream about you two nights ago.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.772
I had to see if there was any truth to it.

13:53.422 --> 13:56.978
You do know that you just used the words "truth"
and "dream" in the same sentence, right?

13:59.014 --> 14:05.584
Okay. So this dream of yours, it hinges
on where I was at 8:30 yesterday?

14:06.334 --> 14:08.102
Well, 8:37, actually.

14:14.780 --> 14:15.801
What is this?

14:16.703 --> 14:17.778
Just a speeding ticket.

14:18.654 --> 14:20.635
Got it on my way out of California.

14:21.734 --> 14:23.139
Look at the time.

14:26.821 --> 14:28.275
"Eight fifty-nine. "

14:28.905 --> 14:29.707
Does that help?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.438
Oh, yeah. Absolutely!

14:33.853 --> 14:34.845
I'm so glad you're here.

14:36.182 --> 14:39.347
Mm. Ooph- you never did
take that shower, did you?

14:40.050 --> 14:40.841
- Uh-uh
 - Oh!

14:41.473 --> 14:43.971
Hello, everybody! I'm home!

14:48.257 --> 14:49.608
Hold that applause.

14:53.775 --> 14:56.460
Dinner won't be ready for 45 minutes.
I'm making something special.

14:56.868 --> 14:58.256
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

14:59.154 --> 15:00.162
Where is everyone?

15:00.760 --> 15:01.786
Homework.

15:02.028 --> 15:02.697
Marie?

15:02.946 --> 15:03.704
Coloring homework.

15:04.213 --> 15:05.823
Well, where's everyone's favorite fugitive?

15:06.549 --> 15:08.341
He's not a fugitive. I was wrong about him.

15:10.227 --> 15:11.766
Actually, he left for a date.

15:12.439 --> 15:13.488
A date?

15:14.032 --> 15:16.477
Guy's been in town about a minute,
he already has a date?

15:17.381 --> 15:20.826
What can I say, we Benoit kids
never wanted for company.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.599
Huh. Wow. We got all kinds of
things boilin' and broilin' here.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.100
Pretend I'm not even here.
I'm not staying, I just forgot my wallet.

15:36.756 --> 15:37.373
Hey.

15:37.434 --> 15:37.898
Hey.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.214
Looks like you're going to
miss a hell of a dinner.

15:41.926 --> 15:43.962
I know. I feel bad.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.226
Although, truthfully?

15:46.525 --> 15:48.781
At this hour I'm in more
of a breakfast mode.

15:49.702 --> 15:50.716
Yeah. What a shock.

15:53.142 --> 15:54.459
So, I guess I'll see you in the morning?

15:54.950 --> 15:56.287
I will see you in the morning.

15:59.713 --> 16:01.156
I'm  going to go clean up,
say hi to the girls.

16:06.982 --> 16:07.905
Hey, where's your date?

16:08.991 --> 16:11.040
Lia? She's outside smoking.

16:11.769 --> 16:14.437
Well, why don't you invite her
inside so we can meet her?

16:14.963 --> 16:17.944
Eh, negative, sis, I just met this honey.

16:18.114 --> 16:21.423
No offense, but I don't want to scare
her off by having her meet family.

16:34.039 --> 16:34.982
No fair- that's peeking.

16:35.749 --> 16:36.910
She's pretty.

16:37.627 --> 16:38.697
Yeah, I know.

16:39.277 --> 16:42.106
And for some reason,
she likes me. Go figure.

16:43.432 --> 16:44.255
Did you find your wallet?

16:44.621 --> 16:49.876
Ah, yes, I did, but, you know, the funny thing is,
though, the damn thing's still... still empty.

16:52.817 --> 16:54.422
Right. How much you need?

16:54.718 --> 16:57.917
Wh... Uh... you know, it's only going
to be till I get to the bank,

16:58.085 --> 17:00.931
and it's not a fortune; we're going to that
cowboy joint down by the interstate,

17:01.178 --> 17:02.626
which is pretty cheap.

17:05.255 --> 17:06.290
How much?

17:06.585 --> 17:07.816
Uh, forty? Sixty?

17:09.365 --> 17:10.430
Just keep this between us.

17:21.222 --> 17:22.945
Did you see the price
of a drink in this place?

17:24.627 --> 17:25.556
It's okay, it's a hotel.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.267
We don't have to order anything,
we can just sit here.

17:28.762 --> 17:29.816
Yeah, but why?

17:30.548 --> 17:32.034
You asked me where I wanted to go.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.367
All right.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.137
Lia...

17:49.087 --> 17:51.606
If you're going to let me take
you to a fancy place like this

17:51.761 --> 17:53.812
but not let me spend a dime on you...

17:54.455 --> 17:58.020
then the least you could do is
maybe not stare at other men.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.492
Don't let the suit fool you-

18:00.617 --> 18:02.843
he's not really a man,
he just impersonates one.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.762
It makes it easier for him
to steal your soul.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.454
You know him?

18:12.521 --> 18:15.114
We worked together.
Traveled together for about a year.

18:17.165 --> 18:19.481
He has a horrible temper,
but he's really good at what he does.

18:20.697 --> 18:22.242
I thought he'd change, I'd change him.

18:22.806 --> 18:24.815
But at a certain point, you realize
that's not going to happen.

18:25.612 --> 18:28.506
And some day he might just
get so angry, he kills you.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.353
Stupid.

18:34.271 --> 18:35.376
Stupid, stupid.

18:37.698 --> 18:39.109
But you guys are over now, right?

18:40.659 --> 18:42.915
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

18:43.977 --> 18:44.868
I had the audaty

18:45.026 --> 18:48.791
to suggest that since we worked as
a team, we should get paid as a team.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.305
And I should get my fair share.

18:53.875 --> 18:57.500
He seemed to think that living
with him, being with him...

18:58.468 --> 19:00.815
sleeping with him, that was payment enough.

19:07.108 --> 19:08.157
Who's that?

19:08.609 --> 19:09.627
He worked with us, too.

19:10.779 --> 19:11.780
There were three of them.

19:13.579 --> 19:14.700
What kind of work did you do?

19:16.130 --> 19:17.376
High finance.

19:18.271 --> 19:19.665
Moving money around.

19:20.251 --> 19:21.876
It sounds more complicated than it is.

19:27.343 --> 19:29.903
Okay, uh... I'm sorry, why are we here?

19:30.655 --> 19:31.446
Why are we doing this?

19:32.326 --> 19:36.013
I don't want to spend all night sitting here
staring at some guy that you say you're over.

19:36.331 --> 19:38.910
No. No. You're right, I'm sorry.

19:40.456 --> 19:41.377
It's not what you think. See,

19:42.702 --> 19:45.121
when we had our fight, when he threw me out?

19:45.973 --> 19:48.560
I never got my stuff. It's still upstairs.

19:48.863 --> 19:50.432
Everything- everything- I own,

19:50.599 --> 19:53.165
my I.D., my money, my clothes. Everything.

19:55.663 --> 19:56.740
I just... I sort of thought that

19:57.034 --> 20:01.220
with you here, I might be able to work
up the courage to walk up to him,

20:01.570 --> 20:02.284
talk to him.

20:04.132 --> 20:05.110
But I can't.

20:07.876 --> 20:08.971
He scares you that much?

20:10.863 --> 20:11.840
You want me to talk to him?

20:12.086 --> 20:12.730
No.

20:13.910 --> 20:18.386
No, that won't work,
he's not a reasonable person.

20:20.604 --> 20:21.614
Well, what are you going to do?

20:23.212 --> 20:24.205
I don't know.

20:26.406 --> 20:28.788
I know he's got an important
meeting tomorrow night

20:29.375 --> 20:31.196
before he gets out of here
and moves on to Nevada.

20:33.418 --> 20:34.628
He'll be out of here for hours.

20:36.073 --> 20:37.211
Uh, what are you talking about?

20:38.095 --> 20:39.728
You talking about breaking into his room?

20:42.685 --> 20:44.625
Damn  it. He's coming over here.

20:58.894 --> 20:59.530
So.

21:00.361 --> 21:01.268
Let me ask you a question.

21:02.479 --> 21:05.191
So what time is this guy
leaving his room tomorrow?

21:05.781 --> 21:06.697
Next person on line please.

21:28.897 --> 21:29.996
I think she's in on it, sir.

21:31.902 --> 21:32.769
Our missing hostage?

21:33.286 --> 21:36.296
I think she's still alive, and the reason we haven't
found her is she doesn't want to be found,

21:36.475 --> 21:38.086
because she's part of the gang
that robbed that bank.

21:38.668 --> 21:40.160
I had a dream about her last night.

21:40.298 --> 21:44.437
She was taking a picture with her cell phone of the
security guard while his back was turned away.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.734
Well, that's hardly proof.

21:48.612 --> 21:49.708
Think about it.

21:49.872 --> 21:55.382
It's been 36 hours, not one single person has come forward 
to identify the woman in that footage as a loved  one.

21:57.092 --> 21:58.063
Cell phone picture, huh?

22:00.690 --> 22:02.362
Actually, sort of clever.

22:03.714 --> 22:06.884
You plant someone in the bank to let
you know when the guard's distracted

22:07.009 --> 22:08.757
so that you can make your entrance
at the most effective moment.

22:09.199 --> 22:12.336
Someone who won't put up a fight when you
suddenly grab them and put a gun to their head.

22:12.946 --> 22:14.576
Help convince everyone you're serious.

22:17.315 --> 22:18.139
Ah, it's...

22:19.612 --> 22:21.674
it's a nice theory, but where does
it leave our headless corpse?

22:22.354 --> 22:25.664
Well, nowhere, except we can be reasonably
sure that she's not our bank hostage.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.255
And where does it leave our robbers?

22:28.199 --> 22:30.402
We still don't have a clue as to who
they are or where they've gone.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.739
Not necessarily.

22:49.976 --> 22:50.988
It was right where you said it would be.

22:51.745 --> 22:52.747
And?

22:55.973 --> 22:56.788
Loaded with prints.

22:58.432 --> 22:59.442
Amelia Purcell.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.750
Arrested twice for shoplifting in 2002.

23:03.364 --> 23:06.501
Almost had her again in 2004 for running
a pyramid scheme out of her apartment,

23:06.685 --> 23:07.638
but the charge didn't stick.

23:07.901 --> 23:10.753
Suspected in a couple of identity
theft cases in 2005.

23:11.194 --> 23:12.561
She's a grifter, a con woman.

23:13.377 --> 23:14.137
Here's the punch line:

23:14.863 --> 23:17.733
turns out we had
Amelia Purcell's DNA on file,

23:18.438 --> 23:20.500
so we ran it against the
headless body in the morgue,

23:20.624 --> 23:22.891
just to rule out any possibility
that it might actually be her.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.892
Only the weird thing is

23:27.578 --> 23:29.104
it ruled her in.

23:30.711 --> 23:31.530
What?

23:31.961 --> 23:33.066
DNA was a perfect match.

23:34.855 --> 23:37.385
Dead lady in the morgue is Amelia Purcell.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.602
The suite is on the top floor, room 1015.

23:46.532 --> 23:50.168
The suitcase is like a brown
tweed with a tan handle.

23:52.858 --> 23:54.084
Are you sure you want to do this?

23:54.629 --> 23:56.315
Where do you want me to
take the bag once I have it?

23:59.863 --> 24:00.573
Where you staying?

24:08.208 --> 24:09.019
Hello?

24:09.565 --> 24:12.402
You were living with this guy,
and now you're not.

24:16.861 --> 24:17.642
Lia, when...

24:18.871 --> 24:21.823
when I drop you off here at night
when you go to pick up your car,

24:22.957 --> 24:23.965
where do you go?

24:31.760 --> 24:33.850
Okay. Yeah.

24:34.227 --> 24:36.620
You know what? I understand.
You just met me.

24:36.995 --> 24:39.372
You know me well enough to
break and enter for you, but

24:39.785 --> 24:42.090
not to actually know
where you sleep at night.

24:43.467 --> 24:44.736
Makes sense to me.

24:46.810 --> 24:47.603
Michael...

24:47.771 --> 24:49.816
You know what, just wait here.

24:50.570 --> 24:52.014
And you're positive this girl is dead?

24:52.671 --> 24:53.849
For almost three days now.

24:54.900 --> 24:58.127
Well, I'm confused. Didn't you say that
you saw her outside of our house last night?

24:58.562 --> 25:01.461
Yeah, that's just the thing.

25:01.793 --> 25:02.865
I did, Joe.

25:02.988 --> 25:04.815
I saw her, 'cause I see dead people.

25:05.878 --> 25:07.849
And apparently, Michael saw her because...

25:08.137 --> 25:09.752
Because like sister
like brother. I get that.

25:10.025 --> 25:12.908
But aren't you usually pretty good
at knowing one when you see one?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.230
No, not all the time, no.

25:15.672 --> 25:18.057
And this girl I saw at night,

25:19.095 --> 25:20.333
through the window at a distance.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.782
And my brother, he doesn't even
believe in this stuff. He never has.

25:24.427 --> 25:26.250
So the possibility wouldn't
even cross his mind.

25:29.166 --> 25:30.537
I wonder if she even knows.

25:34.118 --> 25:35.489
Well, that happens sometimes.

25:36.983 --> 25:40.725
A person dies so suddenly, so violently,
they don't even know what happened.

25:40.918 --> 25:46.916
They just go through their life here on Earth for
awhile wondering why everything feels so funny.

25:47.283 --> 25:48.216
I don't get that.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.639
Wouldn't you figure out pretty
quickly what's going on

25:52.386 --> 25:54.835
once you realized the living
couldn't see you anymore?

25:55.204 --> 25:57.671
Well, that's just it. Maybe 
Amelia Purcell never got there,

25:58.332 --> 26:01.472
'cause the first person she
saw after she died could see her,

26:02.077 --> 26:04.064
and has been seeing her ever since.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.531
Are you gonna tell him?
You've got to tell him.

26:14.098 --> 26:15.265
How are you gonna tell him?

26:23.788 --> 26:27.399
No, no, no, no. 
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

26:29.239 --> 26:30.050
Oh, God.

26:31.871 --> 26:35.901
I know how this must look.
I can totally explain.

26:36.026 --> 26:39.318
I was, I was just leaving this out
here for room service to pick up,

26:39.436 --> 26:43.324
and the damn door slammed shut behind me.

26:46.259 --> 26:48.521
Must lock automatically, 'cause...

26:49.286 --> 26:51.049
I can't get back in.

26:53.301 --> 26:56.504
So, here I am. No key.

26:58.232 --> 26:58.961
No pants.

27:06.346 --> 27:07.332
Ma'am?

27:08.732 --> 27:11.841
Oh, God bless you. God bless you.

27:16.878 --> 27:18.361
You are so gonna get a big tip.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.477
...tan handle.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.696
Brown tweed, tan handle.

27:36.678 --> 27:37.641
Brown tweed...

27:42.264 --> 27:44.155
...tan handle.

27:56.945 --> 27:58.341
You weren't supposed to be here.

28:02.777 --> 28:03.874
Never seen you before.

28:04.897 --> 28:06.919
You must be finance guy number three.

28:11.263 --> 28:12.080
So...

28:13.518 --> 28:16.738
here's the thing, Finance Guy.
I just came for Lia's things, so...

28:17.637 --> 28:18.674
It's kind of up to you.

28:20.752 --> 28:21.736
We can mix it up a bit.

28:23.157 --> 28:25.773
But I just got back from
two years in Afghanistan, so

28:27.120 --> 28:28.846
I'll filet you eight ways from Sunday.

28:32.212 --> 28:36.646
So my advice is you sit your balance sheet
ass down and let me slip out that door.

28:38.075 --> 28:43.012
And after that, if you want to call hotel security
so they can fill out an insurance claim form,

28:43.160 --> 28:44.854
that's between you and them.

28:50.247 --> 28:51.669
Cool.

28:55.821 --> 28:56.935
Excuse me, you want to, uh...

29:00.119 --> 29:01.192
What are you...

29:01.569 --> 29:02.380
Man, I just...

29:03.375 --> 29:04.109
What are you doing?

29:04.316 --> 29:05.578
It's just a bunch of chi stuff!

29:15.573 --> 29:16.349
Do you hear that?

29:21.113 --> 29:23.777
Well, that just sounds like
Saturday morning to me.

29:25.993 --> 29:26.837
It's too loud.

29:28.403 --> 29:29.460
Gonna wake Michael.

29:35.953 --> 29:37.156
Have you guys seen your Uncle Michael?

29:43.869 --> 29:44.640
Everything okay?

29:47.905 --> 29:49.722
Michael never came home last night.

29:51.630 --> 29:53.273
So maybe Lucky got lucky.

29:54.101 --> 29:55.513
Can you get lucky with a ghost?

29:56.942 --> 29:57.660
I think he's in trouble.

30:30.243 --> 30:31.635
Lia. You're Lia, right?

30:33.370 --> 30:35.253
You're Michael's friend?
I'm Michael's sister Allison.

30:35.891 --> 30:38.706
I'm sorry to bother you, it's just
I'm really worried about Michael.

30:38.950 --> 30:42.983
I mean, he didn't come home last night.
I was hoping he might be here, but...

30:43.758 --> 30:45.036
Do you know where he might have gone?

30:45.731 --> 30:47.028
Damn, the sun's up already.

30:47.868 --> 30:50.044
Lia, I'm really worried about my brother.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.805
You're the sister that works
with the police, right?

30:55.958 --> 30:57.674
I'm sorry, I can't help you right now.

30:58.402 --> 31:00.661
As you can see, I've got problems of my own.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.215
Just got to think for a minute.

31:04.883 --> 31:05.995
How'd I get in this car?

31:07.211 --> 31:08.425
I think I can help you.

31:09.772 --> 31:10.771
I know what's going on.

31:12.316 --> 31:14.143
I know how disconnected you must feel.

31:14.854 --> 31:19.414
How you keep losing track of time, you keep finding
yourself in places and not knowing quite how you got there,

31:20.226 --> 31:24.293
but never being able to get very far from this
place, from this bar, from this parking lot.

31:25.414 --> 31:27.142
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:27.622 --> 31:29.922
Haven't you wondered how you got here?

31:31.016 --> 31:32.812
I mean, what is the last thing you remember?

31:35.523 --> 31:36.271
I don't know.

31:37.210 --> 31:40.976
Um, walking in this place,
meeting your brother.

31:42.075 --> 31:42.893
Before that.

31:44.596 --> 31:45.948
Fought with my boyfriend.

31:47.182 --> 31:50.514
Left our hotel, got in my car, just driving.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.815
My cell phone rung. It was him.

31:54.297 --> 31:56.433
He was in his car, too, trying to find me.

31:56.855 --> 31:59.661
We pulled off the interstate, parked here,

32:00.795 --> 32:02.030
got back in his car.

32:02.258 --> 32:05.127
He started driving again.
We started fighting again,

32:06.215 --> 32:07.354
about money, I think.

32:08.082 --> 32:09.103
And then what happened?

32:10.133 --> 32:10.990
Nothing.

32:11.652 --> 32:13.074
We fought all the time.

32:13.915 --> 32:14.860
Nothing happened.

32:15.733 --> 32:16.827
Are you sure?

32:19.388 --> 32:21.561
Don't you remember him pulling off the road

32:22.718 --> 32:24.306
in the dark late at night?

32:25.555 --> 32:29.525
He pulled off the interstate, Lia.
It happened about 200 yards from here.

32:32.578 --> 32:33.602
I don't remember that.

32:34.850 --> 32:35.691
Sure you do.

32:38.836 --> 32:42.268
So did he drag you out of the car,
or did you step out freely?

32:48.291 --> 32:52.042
He... he pulled me out...

32:56.250 --> 32:57.349
...by my hair.

33:02.036 --> 33:02.827
I remember...

33:05.075 --> 33:09.268
I remember hearing the sound of
the trucks going by, the whooshing.

33:12.906 --> 33:15.609
And then I heard the gunshot.

33:25.801 --> 33:28.177
It must have gone in the back of my head.

33:31.451 --> 33:32.272
And after that...

33:39.364 --> 33:40.698
And after that...

33:44.106 --> 33:45.433
After that, it doesn't matter.

33:46.866 --> 33:48.401
After that, you met Michael.

33:56.157 --> 34:01.088
Oh, my God. What's going on here?

34:03.522 --> 34:04.560
He sees me.

34:06.840 --> 34:07.735
You see me.

34:10.043 --> 34:12.132
Does that mean the two of you are?

34:17.580 --> 34:18.311
Oh.

34:21.563 --> 34:22.405
So, um...

34:26.409 --> 34:27.685
How does this work?

34:31.831 --> 34:33.603
Do I ever get to see him again?

34:34.605 --> 34:35.530
It's better than that.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.389
You get to watch him forever.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.040
But, Lia, I really need to know where he is.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.922
Know anything about
money laundering, Michael?

34:48.585 --> 34:50.417
Starts with a very large sum of money,

34:51.067 --> 34:52.304
money that can be traced,

34:52.858 --> 34:55.500
money stolen from a bank.

34:56.797 --> 34:57.622
It works like this.

34:58.298 --> 35:01.024
You take your very large
sum of traceable money

35:01.373 --> 35:04.387
and exchange it for a smaller
sum of money that is clean,

35:04.898 --> 35:07.407
money that cannot be traced.

35:08.268 --> 35:10.972
And we've got a meeting with a
man about that very thing in about...

35:11.530 --> 35:12.293
30 minutes?

35:13.454 --> 35:14.723
And then I'm getting out of Dodge,

35:17.191 --> 35:19.981
so between now and then, I need to
know what I'm going to do with you.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.291
I need to know what I'm
dealing with, Mr. Benoit.

35:28.255 --> 35:29.444
Are you law enforcement?

35:29.615 --> 35:30.748
I don't know what you're talking about, man.

35:33.108 --> 35:34.368
An accommodation can be made.

35:34.521 --> 35:39.445
I'm prepared to reward you
well for your forgetfulness.

35:40.363 --> 35:40.823
Hmm?

35:41.586 --> 35:46.743
You know, maybe it was the shot to the side of the head,
but I still don't understand a word you're saying to me.

35:47.719 --> 35:51.521
Right. You just wandered
in here by accident.

35:52.399 --> 35:54.349
Slipped into the wrong suite by mistake.

35:54.847 --> 35:56.933
I came here for Lia's things, for her bag.

35:57.935 --> 35:59.021
That's it.

36:03.690 --> 36:05.836
Now I have no idea what
you're talking about, Michael.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.187
Who told you her things
would be in this room

36:09.941 --> 36:11.405
and that they'd be in that bag?

36:13.162 --> 36:14.724
I mean, somebody must have told you.

36:15.511 --> 36:18.537
And we all know it couldn't have been Lia.

36:23.685 --> 36:26.561
Fella, I don't know who put you up to this,

36:27.398 --> 36:29.030
but they're making a jackass out of you.

36:29.398 --> 36:30.765
Your story is bogus.

36:32.112 --> 36:33.308
Lia is dead.

36:35.114 --> 36:36.492
And has been for three days.

36:43.519 --> 36:45.209
Now, who are you and
what are you doing here?

36:47.441 --> 36:48.499
She may be dead to you.

36:49.864 --> 36:50.630
What?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.005
Idiot, listen,

36:53.074 --> 36:54.116
I shot her in the skull,

36:54.676 --> 36:55.767
then, I cut her hand off,

36:56.807 --> 36:58.759
and then, I got an ax
out of the trunk of my car

36:59.296 --> 37:00.391
and chopped her head off.

37:01.737 --> 37:05.537
She's dead to me, she's dead to you,
she's dead to the world.

37:07.289 --> 37:12.130
And I'm about to do the same to you if you do not
tell me who you really are and what you're doing here.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.278
Get him off me!

37:20.159 --> 37:21.293
He bit me.

37:21.850 --> 37:23.792
Oh, now I'm bleeding.

37:37.229 --> 37:38.076
I'm sorry.

37:39.027 --> 37:41.422
I would have told you,
but I didn't know myself.

37:42.744 --> 37:43.479
Don't speak.

37:44.451 --> 37:46.193
The police will be here
in about five minutes.

37:47.379 --> 37:49.445
Just repeat everything I say.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.155
Just make it sound like it's yours.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.082
You bit mine. How about I blow yours off?

38:02.904 --> 38:04.081
No, wait a minute, Bobby.

38:04.427 --> 38:07.385
I'll take a beating for you.
That's what we agreed to, but

38:07.536 --> 38:09.561
nobody's puts a gun to my head.

38:09.883 --> 38:10.675
What are you talking about?

38:10.836 --> 38:12.405
I'm talking about our plan,

38:12.763 --> 38:16.617
which never involved guns, so get
that thing away from my head!

38:17.088 --> 38:19.432
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but this ain't going to fly.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.115
I'm talking about Pittsburgh,

38:21.580 --> 38:25.214
I'm talking Patterson,
I'm talking about Baton Rouge.

38:25.715 --> 38:27.458
I'm talking about the way
you told these guys...

38:27.605 --> 38:29.809
I'm talking about how you told
your two friends here

38:29.923 --> 38:32.388
that you were gonna split this
four ways with a piece going to Lia.

38:32.848 --> 38:36.529
When you and I both know you took
50% and only paid them each 25%.

38:37.792 --> 38:38.505
That's it!

38:39.304 --> 38:41.907
I don't know who you really
are or who you really work for,

38:42.335 --> 38:44.111
but I've listened to everything
I'm going to listen to.

38:50.160 --> 38:50.719
Go, go, go!

38:52.998 --> 38:55.346
Phoenix P.D.! Everyone on the floor!
Everybody on the floor!

39:03.642 --> 39:04.481
Michael Benoit?

39:05.459 --> 39:06.385
Yeah.

39:10.901 --> 39:12.293
You don't call, you don't write.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.204
Hey, sis.

39:18.086 --> 39:19.663
Don't look so surprised.

39:20.986 --> 39:22.539
I always wanted to get work done.

39:25.066 --> 39:27.213
I think the doctor did a
pretty good job, didn't he?

39:27.497 --> 39:29.222
The nose almost looks natural.

39:31.689 --> 39:32.945
What am I going to do with you?

39:33.500 --> 39:34.938
What are you going to do with me?

39:35.884 --> 39:37.487
What am I going to do with me?

39:41.028 --> 39:44.399
Listen, don't worry.
I'm not sticking around.

39:47.427 --> 39:48.579
What are you talking about?

39:48.783 --> 39:50.577
You are completely welcome to stick around.

39:51.101 --> 39:52.062
I've been here a week.

39:52.730 --> 39:55.944
I've already accumulated
too many bad memories.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.865
They say I can get out
of here in a couple of days.

40:00.053 --> 40:01.677
I'll come by the house,
pick up my stuff, and then

40:02.430 --> 40:03.492
say goodbye to everybody.

40:09.996 --> 40:10.825
I liked her.

40:12.338 --> 40:15.691
I mean, I didn't get a chance to really
get to know her, but I liked her.

40:18.564 --> 40:19.031
Yeah.

40:24.438 --> 40:26.408
I guess I'm more like you than I realized.

40:27.813 --> 40:29.107
Yeah. Sorry about that.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.038
Just so we're straight,

40:32.746 --> 40:37.532
seeing ghosts, seeing the future,
that is the extent of our superpowers?

40:37.686 --> 40:41.024
I don't have to worry about laser
beams shooting out of my ass

40:41.354 --> 40:44.969
or leaping tall buildings in a single
bound or anything like that?

40:45.320 --> 40:46.904
I believe you and your ass are safe.

40:47.603 --> 40:48.633
Good.

40:57.858 --> 40:58.574
What is this?

41:00.351 --> 41:01.860
A reward check from the bank...

41:02.543 --> 41:04.330
$15,000.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.674
I'm a thousandaire.

41:09.029 --> 41:10.208
I'll be back to see you tomorrow.

41:11.158 --> 41:13.070
Yeah, sure you will,
now that I have the money.

41:16.729 --> 41:17.719
I love you, Michael.

41:19.881 --> 41:20.939
I love you, too, sis.

41:30.831 --> 41:31.772
I like your sister.

41:34.801 --> 41:35.860
She's good people.

41:36.888 --> 41:38.438
She most definitely is that.

41:42.389 --> 41:47.036
I couldn't move on without saying goodbye.

41:49.209 --> 41:50.295
And that I'm sorry.

41:52.890 --> 41:54.472
I never meant for you to get hurt.

41:56.551 --> 41:57.555
I know you didn't.

42:04.925 --> 42:06.808
I wish things could have been different.

42:09.385 --> 42:10.691
I wish we could have met before.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.674
Maybe in another life.

42:18.358 --> 42:19.066
Yeah.

42:22.474 --> 42:23.461
In another life.

42:36.982 --> 42:39.010
Just wanted to make sure
you were okay, Mr. Benoit.

42:42.241 --> 42:43.240
Not yet, ma'am.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.515
But I'm getting there.

42:47.516 --> 42:48.516
