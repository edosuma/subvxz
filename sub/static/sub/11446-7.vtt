WEBVTT

06:21.631 --> 06:22.712
...born dead.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.237
The Virgin will comfort you, Madame.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.496
She, too, lost a child.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.655
Mother Hildegarde...

08:14.411 --> 08:16.322
I came as quickly as I could.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.744
Thank you, Father.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.567
Would you like to make
a last confession...

08:50.447 --> 08:52.279
...so that you may unburden
yourself of any sins?

09:21.311 --> 09:22.301
Stay close to her.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.830
Come down now, little dog.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.795
What is happening?

12:04.766 --> 12:05.801
I'm all right.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.300
Tell Mother Superior.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.597
God be praised!

12:50.019 --> 12:51.680
Not only Hail Marys!

13:04.033 --> 13:05.023
Have faith.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.035
Come, little dog!

13:13.126 --> 13:14.161
Back here, quickly!

13:24.053 --> 13:25.043
Yes.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.711
The fever has passed.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.970
How can it be?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.215
It is a miracle.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.471
A miracle indeed.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.644
God be praised.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.355
Would you bring some broth, Sister?

29:54.876 --> 29:56.708
Do not be afraid of me, my dear Madame.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.668
I don't bite.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.006
...of course not.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.047
Sit, please.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.887
Will you have a sip of warm chocolate?

30:17.274 --> 30:18.685
It's from New Spain.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.229
Thank you.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.773
Your Majesty.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.113
And perhaps an orange...

30:27.743 --> 30:28.904
...from my Orangerie?

30:29.202 --> 30:30.863
I have over a thousand trees.

30:32.748 --> 30:33.783
With pleasure.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.851
Observe.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.074
Read the indictment, if you will.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.036
You are hereby charged with sorcery...

36:14.422 --> 36:18.461
...and the perversion of the
search for knowledge...

36:18.718 --> 36:22.131
...into an exploration of arcane arts.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.046
You stand accused of...

36:24.140 --> 36:25.801
...plundering the teaching...

36:25.975 --> 36:27.886
...of ancient alchemists...

36:28.395 --> 36:31.808
...and employing the dark arts...

36:31.940 --> 36:33.647
...for your own...

36:34.109 --> 36:35.144
.â€œagenda.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.497
We must also...

36:58.800 --> 36:59.835
...consider the evidence...

37:00.844 --> 37:02.084
...which has been collected...

37:02.178 --> 37:04.135
...both from the apothecary of
Master Raymond...

37:05.849 --> 37:09.592
...and the residence of
Le Comte St Germain.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.803
We have brought here a witness.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.271
An infallible judge of truth.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.691
The White Lady.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.945
A pure heart that cannot lie...

37:23.032 --> 37:25.649
...she can see into the soul of a man
and sense whether evil lies within.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.256
Bring out the serpent!

47:48.074 --> 47:49.109
Drink.

47:54.288 --> 47:55.323
I salute you,

47:55.414 --> 47:56.449
Master Raymond...

47:57.124 --> 47:58.159
...you evil bastard.

47:58.501 --> 47:59.536
And you...

48:01.545 --> 48:04.333
...witch who sucks the cock of the Devil.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.174
I'll see you...

48:13.516 --> 48:14.551
...in Hell.

49:29.842 --> 49:30.877
Count yourself fortunate...

49:31.802 --> 49:32.837
...but leave today and never...

49:32.928 --> 49:34.669
...set foot in France again.

59:14.051 --> 59:15.416
Holy Mother of God.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.095
It is time, my dear.
