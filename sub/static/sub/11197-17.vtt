WEBVTT

00:11.560 --> 00:13.840
We've been over this, Mr Ambassador.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.840
Your submarine. Yes, yes.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.560
The missile sub Rostov was less than
75km from the impact of the meteor.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.720
You insist on maintaining this story?

00:22.840 --> 00:25.440
The shock wave caused
severe damage and she sank.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.720
ln the spirit of international cooperation, a
rescue vessel was sent from Pearl Harbor.

00:30.800 --> 00:35.800
Unfortunately the Rostov's reactor went
critical before she arrived on the scene.

00:35.920 --> 00:40.320
l have heard your government
repeat this story time and time again.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.440
Yet, according to our intelligence,
on the day in question

00:43.560 --> 00:49.760
the submarine in question was still taking
on supplies in the harbour at Vladivostok.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.640
What can l say, Ambassador?

00:52.720 --> 00:56.640
Your intelligence is wrong.
And not for the first time, l might add.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.920
The Americans are hiding something,
and have been for years.

01:00.040 --> 01:04.000
That Russia seems to have no objection
is all the more confusing.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.640
- ln the spirit of cooperation...
- Please.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.440
What you call a new spirit of cooperation
between your two countries, Colonel,

01:11.560 --> 01:15.160
makes the People's Republic of China
uncomfortable.

01:15.280 --> 01:19.200
- We couldn't help but overhear.
- Yes. l was trying to explain...

01:19.320 --> 01:23.680
My dear Colonel, if we can agree
on anything, it's that your lost submarine

01:23.760 --> 01:27.200
is merely the latest in a long list
of extremely unlikely events

01:27.280 --> 01:30.320
the Americans have attempted
to foist upon us as the truth.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.760
- Yes. The Americans are up to something.
- They did summon us here for a reason.

01:35.840 --> 01:42.080
To hear more stories of falling meteors
and exploding hot-air balloons.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.080
Mr Ambassador, l am sure we can provide
you with the necessary evidence...

01:46.200 --> 01:49.680
That won't be necessary, Colonel.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.520
(speaks Russian)

01:55.920 --> 01:58.480
(both speaking Russian)

02:03.800 --> 02:05.360
General?

02:07.400 --> 02:10.120
Gentlemen, please be seated.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.120 --> 02:30.880
Thank you.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.840
Welcome to the Pentagon.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.400
Please forgive any security measures
you had to undergo to get here.

02:36.520 --> 02:41.120
ln America we try never to underestimate
the competence or curiosity of our media.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.640
We asked you here to inform you
of a secret operation

02:43.760 --> 02:48.000
that the US Air Force is operating
out of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.520
lt's called the Stargate programme.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.880
Gentlemen, the Stargate.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.839
The device itself
was discovered in Egypt in 1928,

04:16.959 --> 04:19.360
where it lay buried
for several thousand years.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.440
ln 1945 a team of scientists looking
for a military application for the device

04:23.520 --> 04:27.000
established a stable wormhole
by a process of random dialling.

04:27.080 --> 04:31.680
For all intents and purposes a lucky
accident, which they could not repeat.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.280
The gate remained inactive
until eight years ago,

04:35.400 --> 04:39.200
when this man, Dr Daniel Jackson,
joined the programme.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.080
Dr Jackson deciphered
the symbols on the gate,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.960
allowing us to begin
exploration of alien worlds.

04:45.040 --> 04:49.720
Since that time, Mr Ambassadors, we
have visited literally hundreds of planets.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.200
Thousands more remain to be explored.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.840
What?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.640
This is absurd.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.840
l know it's a lot to process, gentlemen.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.520
The first time l saw the gate activated,
l could hardly believe my eyes.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.560
- lt is true.
- You know about this?

05:08.680 --> 05:12.480
The Russian government has been
aware of the Stargate for some time.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.560
Are you quite serious?

05:14.680 --> 05:20.400
Did your president not recently call
Great Britain ''America's closest ally''?

05:20.480 --> 05:23.720
One of our people illegally
sold the Russians information

05:23.800 --> 05:27.360
which allowed them to temporarily
operate their own programme.

05:27.480 --> 05:31.360
- You had one of these Stargates?
- For a short time.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.160
How many of these
bloody things are there?

05:34.280 --> 05:40.080
Another Stargate was recovered from
the bottom of the ocean two years ago.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.800
l don't understand.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.600
SG-1 was trapped
aboard an Asgard vessel.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.720
They beamed aboard our Stargate
as their means of escape.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.040
So the gate the Russians recovered from
the Pacific was the gate found in Egypt.

06:25.120 --> 06:28.480
We replaced it with a gate we
discovered in Antarctica five years ago.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.960
That Stargate has since been destroyed.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.720
The original gate is back in Colorado,
leased from the Russian government.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.760
The explosion of your nuclear submarine
was a cover story for these events?

06:43.840 --> 06:49.760
Actually the Rostov explosion covered up
the explosion of a crashed Goa'uld ship.

06:49.840 --> 06:54.160
Whereas the Stargate
was aboard an Asgard... ship.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.560
The Asgard...

06:57.640 --> 07:00.160
Obviously this is very confusing
at first glance.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.120
Oh, no, no, no. What could be more clear?

07:03.240 --> 07:06.760
There were two different sorts
of alien ships. l follow completely.

07:06.880 --> 07:11.680
This is much more believable than the
accidental loss of a Russian submarine.

07:11.760 --> 07:17.760
Although l am dubious that not one but
two reported meteors in the last few years

07:17.880 --> 07:20.320
were in fact alien ships.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.960
Actually, there were three.

07:25.720 --> 07:30.960
Gentlemen. Sorry l'm late. l had a meeting
on the hill that couldn't be postponed.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.560
Senator.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.280
General. What have l missed?

07:35.360 --> 07:40.960
Your officers have been telling us
several tall tales, as you might say.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.440
(chuckles)

07:43.560 --> 07:49.200
So you've been at this God knows how
long and they don't even believe you?

07:50.200 --> 07:53.360
lf that doesn't take the cake...

07:53.480 --> 07:57.200
l don't know what they've told you,
but it's true. The Stargate exists.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.880
And they go through
the damn thing on a daily basis.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.240
Does everyone in your government
know about this?

08:04.360 --> 08:08.720
As chair of the Appropriations Committee,
Senator Kinsey was given a full briefing.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.600
l demanded to know
where all the money was going.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.920
And believe you me,
we're talking about a lot of money.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.400
l'm sure what you find hard to believe
is why we would come forward with this.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.280
The Chinese government
has threatened to go public

08:25.360 --> 08:28.880
with information that contradicts
one of our cover stories.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.920
But that isn't the only reason.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.400
The fact is,

08:34.520 --> 08:40.640
due in no small part to the actions of
the Stargate programme's flagship team,

08:40.760 --> 08:43.120
SG-1 ,

08:46.080 --> 08:48.920
our planet is facing imminent danger.

08:52.160 --> 08:57.080
So, assuming this is not
some sort of elaborate hoax,

08:57.200 --> 09:01.200
and there are no television cameras
ready to pop out at any moment,

09:01.320 --> 09:05.480
these aliens who threaten
to destroy Earth even as we speak...

09:05.560 --> 09:07.840
- The Goa'uld.
- Mm-hm.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.560
- They built the Stargate?
- No, sir.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.000
The gate system was built by
an older race, long since disappeared.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.000
The Goa'uld regularly use the gates,

09:16.120 --> 09:21.360
but they subjugate humans with powerful
ships capable of interstellar travel.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.160
Such as the one
that crashed in the Pacific Ocean.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.360
And the Goa'uld have dozens,
if not hundreds, of these vessels.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.520
This is a single Ha'tak-class vessel.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.840
Each Goa'uld system lord
operates entire fleets of these.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.640
(Davis) Typically a Goa'uld flagship
is several times this size.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.120
They also have bombers called Al-Kesh

09:57.240 --> 09:59.840
and small fighters
known as Death Gliders.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.000
Pull up, Teal'c. Teal'c, pull up

10:17.280 --> 10:19.800
The Goa'uld are
more advanced than us in every way.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.400
There can be no doubt that
they have hostile intentions.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.920
- Can we negotiate with them?
- The Goa'uld are a predatory species, sir.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.360
They will enslave a planet or, in the face
of resistance, wipe out its inhabitants.

10:32.440 --> 10:37.200
They don't negotiate. We have witnessed
Goa'uld attacks on several worlds.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.160
They begin with a long-range assault
launched from orbit,

10:40.280 --> 10:44.400
designed to take out planetary defences
and instil fear in the population.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.720
(echoing voice) l am Svarog.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.680
From this day forth, you will serve me.

11:02.240 --> 11:08.000
After their orbital assault, they'll move in
to strike any remaining ground positions.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.160
After that, they'll put
their troops on the ground.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.800
Each mothership carries hundreds
if not thousands of warriors.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.200
They appear to be amassing a few troops.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.200
lt was high time you were all briefed
on what we're up against.

11:51.320 --> 11:54.160
lf what you are saying is true,

11:54.280 --> 12:00.600
then the US has unilaterally taken actions
which have placed the world in jeopardy.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.240
Mr Ambassador, l know how you feel.
When this was brought to my attention,

12:04.360 --> 12:09.520
l insisted that the gate was
too dangerous to remain in operation.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.880
Unfortunately l was overruled.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.600
With due respect, the president
took your recommendation.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.680
And it nearly resulted in disaster.
lt was only because of the efforts of SG-1 ,

12:21.800 --> 12:25.840
who violated your order to shut down
the gate, that we managed to survive.

12:25.960 --> 12:30.000
Oh, and they've done a great job since,
under your tenure, haven't they, General?

12:30.080 --> 12:34.000
You managed to defeat
the Goa'uld known as Apophis,

12:34.120 --> 12:38.560
only to see him replaced
by another more dangerous one.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.840
lsn't that a fair assessment?

12:57.320 --> 13:00.000
(deep Goa'uld voice)
You are the one they call Thor.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.480
l am Anubis.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.920
As l have told your lieutenant,
l will reveal nothing to you.

13:08.040 --> 13:12.800
This device will be
implanted into your brain.

13:14.560 --> 13:19.560
lt will form a link between
your mind and the ship's computer.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.520
Your knowledge will simply be
downloaded into our memory banks.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.440
You will no doubt resist.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.920
And you will no doubt fail.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.800
The Goa'uld possess no such technology.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.280
l think you'll find many things
have changed since my return.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.640
Admittedly, Anubis has technology
that is far superior to any other Goa'uld.

13:52.760 --> 13:57.440
But we could not have foreseen his return
to power among the other system lords.

13:57.520 --> 14:03.520
The point is, he's already tried
to destroy the Earth on two occasions.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.880
l'm sure you were getting to that.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.200
Yes, sir. A year ago, we discovered an
asteroid on a collision course with Earth.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.560
When you say ''asteroid''
l assume you mean ''spaceship''.

14:20.680 --> 14:26.000
No, sir. Not this time.
We were fortunate to detect it at all.

14:26.080 --> 14:30.640
There'd have been no need for a cover
story. lt would have wiped out all life.

14:32.640 --> 14:39.120
The asteroid had been deliberately set on
a collision course with Earth by Anubis.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.800
Fortunately we managed
to divert it in time.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.240
Carter, l can see my house.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.200
Engaging hyperdrive... now.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.840
l should point out once again,
gentlemen, that it was SG-1 who saved us.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.920
Are we expecting another attack?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.120
Anubis is consolidating his
position amongst the system lords,

15:19.240 --> 15:21.680
but in time he will
turn his attention back to Earth.

15:21.800 --> 15:27.360
The nations represented here make up
the bulk of this planet's military capacity.

15:27.480 --> 15:34.080
Our chances for successful resistance
would be improved if we work together.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.160
This would require an unprecedented
level of military cooperation,

15:38.240 --> 15:43.160
as well as a commitment from all of you
to maintain absolute secrecy.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.560
l'm afraid that may be impossible.

15:46.640 --> 15:51.280
lf we are facing invasion then we must
warn our people so they can prepare.

15:51.360 --> 15:56.280
Ambassador, we feel that coming forward
now would result in widespread panic.

15:56.400 --> 16:01.120
As opposed to the panic that will result
when aliens march through our streets?

16:01.200 --> 16:06.640
The government of China does not believe
in keeping secrets from its people.

16:06.720 --> 16:11.200
We may have no choice
but to release this information.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.160
We're talking about
a full-scale attack from space.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.720
l'm afraid people are going to notice.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.800
We're hoping it won't come to that.

16:32.880 --> 16:37.600
As you now know, Stargate Command has
dealt with several threats to this planet

16:37.720 --> 16:40.160
without divulging
information to the public.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.280
You've been lucky and you know it.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.280
We also have damn good people.
We've given as good as we've got.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.520
On one occasion we managed
to wipe out an entire fleet of motherships.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.280
- This SG-1 , l assume?
- That's right.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.640
Engaging force field.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.800
(exhales)

17:07.800 --> 17:10.160
- Something wrong?
- No.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.319
l've just never blown up a star before.

17:15.839 --> 17:20.319
Well, they say
the first one's always the hardest.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.400
They say that.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.400
Opening cargo bay doors.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.600
Releasing the clamps.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.360
And the gate is away.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.520
A significant achievement,

18:13.600 --> 18:16.560
but the circumstances
would be difficult to duplicate.

18:16.640 --> 18:22.240
For all their advanced technology,
the Goa'uld have a fatal flaw. Arrogance.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.080
We've taken advantage of the fact
that they don't perceive us to be a threat.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.040
Clearly that's no longer the case.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.240
The point is, they're not invincible.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.680
Our technology may be inferior,
but it is effective.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.800
- Target Sierra One has been acquired.
- Missile away.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.680
Sierra One has been destroyed.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.920
Very impressive. But nothing on Earth
could go up against these motherships.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.440
Mr Ambassador, our primary mission

19:15.560 --> 19:19.120
has been to obtain technology
capable of defending this planet.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.520
And we've made significant progress.

19:21.600 --> 19:26.440
We've made progress.
The jury's still out on ''significant''.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.320
Since the Stargate has been in operation

19:29.400 --> 19:32.200
we've acquired knowledge
of alien technologies.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.840
We've tried to adapt them to our uses.

19:34.920 --> 19:40.920
Towards that end, two years ago we
developed a fighter-interceptor, the X-301 .

19:42.840 --> 19:47.360
lt combined human technology and
parts from two salvaged Death Gliders.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.400
The prototype failed
to live up to expectation.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.200
Beginning attack run now.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.360
(whooping)

20:05.440 --> 20:08.640
- l am no longer in control, O'Neill.
- Excuse me?

20:08.760 --> 20:12.920
The craft is not accepting input from
the controls. The drive is at full power.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.480
- This is an emergency.
- The ejection system has malfunctioned.

20:18.600 --> 20:23.440
We are no longer in control. l repeat,
we have lost control and cannot eject.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.560
After the failure of the X-301

20:28.680 --> 20:33.120
we concentrated on creating an entirely
man-made craft with similar abilities.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.800
The result was the X-302.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.680
- Navigation?
- Check.

20:48.800 --> 20:53.320
- Oxygen, pressure, temperature control?
- All check.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.240
lnertial dampeners?

20:58.640 --> 21:01.120
Cool... and check.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.360
- Engines?
- All check.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.240
- Phasers?
- Sorry, sir.

21:08.320 --> 21:13.520
Systems operational. Mission Command,
all systems go from Abydos One.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.600
Do you mean to tell me
that the United States Air Force

21:29.720 --> 21:35.440
is flying a fighter-interceptor capable
of both aerial combat and space flight?

21:35.560 --> 21:38.240
That's correct.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.760
This... is unacceptable

21:40.880 --> 21:43.040
Mr Ambassador,
l understand how you feel...

21:43.120 --> 21:47.120
With all due respect, General,
l don't think you do.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.160
Your government has operated
this Stargate for six years,

21:50.240 --> 21:53.680
supposedly for the benefit of all mankind.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.200
Yet now we find out you've been
taking advantage of the situation

21:57.320 --> 22:02.320
to create military hardware that radically
alters the balance of power on this planet.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.200
The X-302 was designed
to defend against the Goa'uld.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.640
We have no intention
of using it against our neighbours.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.880
And for that we have only your word.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.480
The United States has had
such capabilities for some time,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.560
but have not used them on other nations.

22:16.680 --> 22:21.520
Are there any other new technologies
that we need to know about?

22:21.640 --> 22:27.440
Might as well tell them, General.
They're gonna find out sooner or later.

22:29.440 --> 22:35.520
Since we encountered a mothership we
have been working on a countermeasure.

23:07.080 --> 23:12.000
Prometheus was designed to carry
a complement of eight X-302 fighters,

23:12.080 --> 23:14.080
and is one of several planned.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.200
l must contact my government
immediately.

23:17.320 --> 23:22.800
Mr Ambassador, we volunteered this
information in a spirit of cooperation.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.800
We're trying to create a coalition
to defend the entire world.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.080
- Under your leadership.
- We have the experience.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.320
l'm sorry, General, but it may be
impossible to achieve an agreement

23:34.440 --> 23:37.840
as long as the Stargate
and any resultant technologies

23:37.920 --> 23:42.400
remain solely under the control
of the United States military.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.640
- What do you suggest?
- Move the gate to a neutral location

23:46.760 --> 23:50.560
and create a permanent staff
drawn from all five nations.

23:50.680 --> 23:55.600
- l'm afraid we can't agree to that.
- The choice may finally not be up to you.

23:55.720 --> 23:59.400
Once the rest of the world learns
of the Stargate, they may well demand it.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.520
We support the United States.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.480
And what are you getting
in exchange for this support?

24:04.560 --> 24:09.120
Gentlemen, please. Perhaps
l can offer a compromise. Please?

24:18.760 --> 24:23.120
l sympathise
with the ambassador's position.

24:23.240 --> 24:29.840
A device as powerful as the Stargate
in the hands of a military organisation...

24:29.920 --> 24:35.600
lt's a recipe for abuse,
despite everyone's best intentions.

24:39.040 --> 24:44.480
- What are you suggesting?
- We have a civilian agency called the NlD.

24:44.560 --> 24:50.880
lts mandate has been to keep an eye
on top-secret projects like the Stargate,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.760
and has done so from the beginning.

24:53.840 --> 25:00.320
l propose that we give this organisation
direct control of the gate,

25:00.400 --> 25:02.680
effective immediately.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.800
You can't be serious.

25:04.880 --> 25:10.240
l'm completely serious. The NlD is the
only organisation besides the air force

25:10.360 --> 25:15.280
that has the knowledge, experience
and skill to run the Stargate.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.080
- They tried to kill you, Senator.
- Now, now, Major.

25:18.160 --> 25:22.000
Those were rogue agents
working for outside interests.

25:22.120 --> 25:26.640
Under the NlD, l'm sure we can determine
a suitable level of participation

25:26.760 --> 25:30.960
for all the great nations
represented here at this table.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.200
Senator, could we speak in private?

25:33.320 --> 25:38.800
l find your reluctance to relinquish
military control of the gate disturbing.

25:38.880 --> 25:43.440
You'd do a lot better to trust the US
Air Force than the NlD, Mr Ambassador.

25:43.560 --> 25:48.080
The General has an understandable
personal prejudice against the NlD.

25:48.160 --> 25:51.600
Personal prejudice? Senator,
their record speaks for itself.

25:51.680 --> 25:55.360
l've never met anyone who liked
doing what they do more than you.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.800
You were good at it. Great.

25:58.880 --> 26:03.800
You'll never convince me
you just got fed up. l'll never buy that.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.000
You don't understand.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.280
And l won't unless you explain it to me.

26:11.240 --> 26:15.680
Two weeks ago l was contacted
by a representative of the NlD.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.600
He suggested l should become
more aggressive in my policies.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.280
They've no jurisdiction.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.480
They wanted me to help them
access off-world technology,

26:24.560 --> 26:28.160
which they're unable to do since we shut
down their side operation.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.880
- You told him to go to hell.
- Of course.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.680
Then he told me that if l didn't cooperate
there would be consequences.

26:35.800 --> 26:41.520
The next day two men in plain clothes,
driving a black unmarked car,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.640
picked up my granddaughters at school.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.200
- l don't believe it.
- They took them for a ride,

26:47.320 --> 26:51.680
then brought them home.
The girls were fine, but l got the message.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.400
We're talking about
a borderline-criminal organisation

26:56.480 --> 27:01.040
whose true mandate has always been
to acquire alien technology at any cost.

27:01.160 --> 27:06.560
lf the threat posed by this Anubis
is as serious as you say,

27:06.680 --> 27:10.000
acquiring alien technology
should be our first priority.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.840
Tell that to the Madronans. The NlD
stole a weather device from their planet,

27:13.960 --> 27:16.000
destabilising their atmosphere.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.920
They'd have died if SG-1 hadn't found
the culprits and retrieved the device.

27:28.720 --> 27:32.080
- Stand to, gentlemen
- (guns click)

27:32.160 --> 27:34.960
Keep those hands visible.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.760
- Who the hell are you?
- No one's damn business.

27:39.880 --> 27:42.480
Step away from the crate.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.280
(chevrons locking)

28:12.800 --> 28:14.240
Stop

28:26.360 --> 28:28.160
Don't do it

28:34.000 --> 28:35.200
Ah

28:36.200 --> 28:37.760
What?

28:39.880 --> 28:42.560
l missed the address.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.920
At least we have this.

28:54.120 --> 28:59.040
After we shut down their operation they
continued to steal from an off-world base.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.640
But they stole from the wrong aliens.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.640
What are they doing?

29:08.760 --> 29:11.920
Taking back
what's rightfully theirs, l guess.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.520
Listen up, all of you.
You've got two choices here.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.960
As soon as they stop taking stuff,
they'll start taking people.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.600
Now, you can go with the Asgard,

29:21.680 --> 29:24.560
or you can follow me. lt's your choice.

29:24.680 --> 29:29.680
l'll be holding the door open
so you can't go anywhere else.

29:51.880 --> 29:55.560
Granted, the NlD employed some
questionable methods in the past.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.120
But we're all agreed
the status quo won't do.

30:00.080 --> 30:03.680
And l would hesitate to point fingers,
General Hammond.

30:03.800 --> 30:09.200
That you and Jack O'Neill are still
in charge of the Stargate programme...

30:09.320 --> 30:13.760
- lf you're questioning our record...
- l'm questioning your competence.

30:13.880 --> 30:19.760
But, if you want to look at your records
in the company of these fine gentlemen...

30:19.840 --> 30:21.440
that's just fine.

30:21.520 --> 30:27.440
These reports detail incidents in which
the operation of the Stargate programme

30:27.520 --> 30:33.280
has brought this planet to the brink
of destruction. For example...

30:35.280 --> 30:40.400
four years ago, despite indications of
extreme danger, you opened a wormhole

30:40.480 --> 30:44.560
to a planet that was in the process
of being destroyed by a black hole.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.240
That was unforeseeable.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.920
Gravitational and time distortions
were translated through the gate,

30:50.040 --> 30:52.880
which you had been unable to disengage.

30:52.960 --> 30:57.760
And the Earth came within
a hair's breadth of being torn apart.

30:57.880 --> 31:03.840
We did shut down the gate by directing an
explosive device through the wormhole.

31:03.960 --> 31:08.400
And l believe it was Jack O'Neill
who risked his life to pull it off.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.200
Teal'c, pull him up

31:48.240 --> 31:51.760
(Kinsey) What else
do we have here? Ah, yes.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.000
lsn't it true that
while under your command

31:54.120 --> 31:58.800
the Stargate facility has been
completely overrun by alien life forms?

32:12.440 --> 32:14.000
Get out of there

32:37.120 --> 32:41.680
We've set the self-destruct. You have less
than five minutes to tell us to override.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.920
Roger that

32:59.760 --> 33:01.520
Now.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.840
Close that iris.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.240
lt's overridden.
l'm shutting down the gate.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.880
The situation was successfully contained.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.160
The situation should never have arisen.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.120
Not if you had been doing your job.

33:39.080 --> 33:44.320
And these incidents
are just the tip of the iceberg.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.080
Face it, General. Under your command,

33:48.200 --> 33:52.320
the Stargate programme
has lurched from one crisis to the next,

33:52.440 --> 33:57.560
never averting disaster by
anything more than the skin of its teeth.

33:57.640 --> 34:02.880
We can't afford
to let you roll the dice any longer.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.480
Would you excuse us, please?

34:16.560 --> 34:21.360
Made a few calls. Kinsey's moving from
Appropriations to lntelligence Oversight.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.120
Which would give him
direct power over the NlD.

34:24.239 --> 34:29.040
He's manipulated this whole situation
to gain control of the Stargate.

34:30.040 --> 34:33.040
l may have my own ace up my sleeve.

34:34.520 --> 34:37.920
l understand your feelings,
Mr Ambassador, believe me.

34:38.040 --> 34:42.560
We're junior partners in the Stargate,
following the lead of the Americans.

34:42.679 --> 34:46.719
The Chinese government will not accept
a secondary position so graciously.

34:46.840 --> 34:52.360
There are advantages. The programme
costs them seven billion dollars a year.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.760
- They reap the benefits.
- The X-303?

34:55.880 --> 34:59.920
Research and development of the
hyperdrive alone has cost two billion.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.080
And it still doesn't function properly.

35:02.160 --> 35:08.120
They will spend more money and risk the
lives of their people perfecting the design.

35:08.240 --> 35:13.640
Then we'll get the blueprints and build
our own ship in less time for half the cost.

35:13.720 --> 35:20.320
Once again, l apologise, gentlemen. lt
seems a politician's work is never done.

35:21.280 --> 35:25.040
You could have the same deal.
(speaks Russian)

35:35.240 --> 35:38.240
Now, where were we?

35:39.560 --> 35:42.800
Gentlemen, l realise we're in
no position to make demands here.

35:42.880 --> 35:45.200
We're trying to reach a consensus.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.480
But before you go to your leaders
and make recommendations,

35:48.600 --> 35:50.720
l want you to consider something.

35:50.840 --> 35:56.480
Whoever runs the Stargate will represent
this planet throughout the galaxy.

35:56.600 --> 36:02.880
They will be ambassadors, meeting other
races, establishing ties with other worlds.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.720
lt is true that in the six years we've
run the Stargate we've made enemies.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.640
But we've also made friends.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.520
l believe we've
acquitted ourselves with honour.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.000
On that score, l stand by the record.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.480
(whispering)

36:36.800 --> 36:40.560
This is the Asgard planet Othala
in the galaxy of lda.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.960
Why did l come here?

36:44.480 --> 36:48.240
The ancients moved on
from our region of space long ago.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.600
But your subconscious mind
used their knowledge to find us here,

36:51.680 --> 36:53.920
where you could get help.

36:54.040 --> 36:58.640
- Very impressive.
- Well, you know...

36:58.760 --> 37:02.800
We did not think your brains
had advanced even that far.

37:02.880 --> 37:08.080
How is it you know
so much about our brains?

37:08.920 --> 37:11.640
We have studied your race closely.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.400
Ah.

37:18.760 --> 37:24.120
- What did you learn?
- That your species has great potential.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.680
Great potential.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.120
That's good.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.800
(all Asgard whispering)

37:49.720 --> 37:52.000
You make an interesting case, General.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.280
However, l'm afraid l must
take this matter to my government

37:55.400 --> 37:58.640
and recommend
full disclosure to our people.

37:58.760 --> 38:04.880
l must do the same, though l will admit
Senator Kinsey's proposal is interesting.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.120
Thank you, Mr Ambassador.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.520
Hello...?

38:25.600 --> 38:31.200
Hello. l am Thor,
Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet.

38:31.280 --> 38:35.120
- Thank you for coming, Thor.
- lt is my pleasure, General Hammond.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.000
The Asgard are in your debt.

38:38.120 --> 38:39.200
''Your debt''?

38:39.320 --> 38:42.480
SG-1 , under the command
of General Hammond,

38:42.560 --> 38:46.480
has saved my people and yours
on many occasions.

38:46.600 --> 38:51.040
We are not only allies against the Goa'uld,
we are true friends.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.560
Commander Thor, my name is...

38:54.680 --> 38:56.960
Senator Kinsey.

38:57.080 --> 39:01.880
O'Neill suggested l send you
to a distant planet for your actions here.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.040
But l am reasonably certain
his statement was in jest.

39:05.120 --> 39:09.880
- l'm sure it was, Commander...
- Supreme Commander.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.840
lt is the opinion of the Asgard High
Council that Stargate Command

39:13.920 --> 39:19.360
should be left in the very capable hands
of General Hammond and his team.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.360
And while our continued friendship
with Earth is not contingent on that,

39:23.480 --> 39:25.920
it is preferred.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.360
You came all this way just to tell us that?

39:34.280 --> 39:39.200
And to install Asgard-designed
shields and weapons on Prometheus.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.480
A small token of thanks
for SG-1's recent efforts

39:42.560 --> 39:47.360
in securing our galaxy and yours
from certain destruction.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.240
l see.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.360
l hope l have been successful
in convincing you.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.680
- Good day, General Hammond.
- Always a pleasure, Thor.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.400
Please drop in any time.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.200
Well...

40:04.120 --> 40:08.240
that settles it, then.
You have our support, General.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.120
- Thank you, Ambassador.
- Ours as well.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.120
And the continued support of Russia.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.360
lt's much appreciated, sir.

40:20.080 --> 40:23.600
While l still have my reservations,

40:23.680 --> 40:28.480
l believe my government will agree
that, for the time being,

40:28.560 --> 40:31.520
the Stargate is in the right hands.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.360
Senator?

40:37.560 --> 40:40.000
l'll say this, General.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.920
Well played.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.960
