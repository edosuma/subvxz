00:30.595 --> 00:33.598
in very awkward situations.

00:33.642 --> 00:36.645
I mean, just look
at that face, Jo.

Although, that would
have been less painful.

ahead of myself.

I was more naive back then.

01:25.389 --> 01:31.047
This doesn't make me a loner with a highly
evolved defense mechanism or anything.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.441
OK, fine, it does.

01:33.484 --> 01:37.401
Today, everything

02:02.818 --> 02:07.257
It's an identity, like the muscle

02:07.301 --> 02:09.607

11:49.012 --> 11:51.493
But when you've moved
as much as I have,

11:51.536 --> 11:56.411
you kinda get attached to the idea of
settling down in one place for four years.

11:56.454 --> 12:00.110
In this case,
my mother's alma mater.

12:00.154 --> 12:04.245
My dad and I have been
on our own for a long time.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.638
My mom died before I was one.

12:06.682 --> 12:11.774
So life wasn't exactly your typical
warm and fuzzy greeting card.

12:11.818 --> 12:16.344
But I wasn't the only one
in my own personal hell.

12:16.387 --> 12:19.913
Abby was hoping that her
swollen, black ankle

12:19.956 --> 12:24.787
might be enough for Mandi to forget
about her dog's infamous upchuck.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.444
And it might have been,

12:29.487 --> 12:32.926
if not for the
two's long history.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.581
Jealousy is a funny thing.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.410
They had lived across
from each other for years.

12:39.454 --> 12:43.371
And while Mandi, seemingly,
had everything,

12:43.414 --> 12:45.460
Abby had more.
She had two parents

12:45.503 --> 12:48.637
who went a little overboard
for their darling Abby.

12:48.680 --> 12:53.076
First, there was the infamous
moon bounce war at age five.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.296
Mandi's was cool,

12:55.339 --> 12:58.342
but Abby's
was three stories high.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.562
Yay!

13:02.607 --> 13:04.827
[Jo] Then, the French
Revolution Halloween meltdown

13:04.871 --> 13:06.437
at age 11.

13:06.481 --> 13:09.745
Mandi flaunted her
store-bought peasant costume,

13:09.789 --> 13:12.574
until she spotted Abby's
utterly perfect,

13:12.617 --> 13:16.491
hand-stitched,
Marie Antoinette royal gown.

13:19.494 --> 13:23.672
And finally, the great bra
incident of junior high.

13:23.715 --> 13:26.109
- Hi, Mandi.
- Hi.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.678
[Jo] Well, that had more
to do with nature.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.116
Still, Mandi might have
found someone else to hate,

13:33.160 --> 13:36.946
if Abby hadn't
done the unthinkable.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.083
Mandi, oh, my God! Someone has
a better parking space than us.

13:43.126 --> 13:46.826
Hey, babe, who snagged
the plush disabled spot?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.828
I guess you're number two now.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.569
Two? Two?

13:51.613 --> 13:54.485
[Jo] Mandi hated
being number two.

13:56.183 --> 14:01.188
- This is war.
- Oh, God.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.933
- Elliot, we need a little favor.
- Sure.

14:06.976 --> 14:10.197
- Chastity.
- [groans softly]

14:10.240 --> 14:13.896
- Hey.
- Anything.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.985
- You're on the Web team, right?
- Of course.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.900
Trained in Java and C++.

14:17.944 --> 14:21.164
I also have my Math Club Card,
Hacker Membership, Journalist Pass,

14:21.208 --> 14:25.995
- and I do a little salsa for the ladies.
- Oh!

14:26.039 --> 14:27.562
How can I be of service?

14:28.737 --> 14:33.002
- Oops.
- [laughter]

14:33.046 --> 14:36.571
- Sorry.
- Oh, gross!

14:36.614 --> 14:41.445
Abby Scabby's face looks as red and
pussy as it did in seventh grade.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.273
Zit cream much?

14:43.317 --> 14:47.582
[Jo] Mandi was creative,
ruthless, unrelenting.

14:47.625 --> 14:51.978
- I'd seen her kind before.
- Need a napkin?

14:58.071 --> 15:01.901
[Jo] And this was
just the beginning.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.425
[cell phone rings]

15:04.468 --> 15:06.122
Brutal.

15:10.735 --> 15:15.131
You know, most girls would have laughed,
texted back or posted a status update.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.525
Do I look like most girls?

15:17.568 --> 15:21.224
[school bell rings]

15:21.268 --> 15:24.097
- [thudding]
- [laughing]

15:28.275 --> 15:30.190
Oh, God.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.931
[boy] What a paint job!

15:35.282 --> 15:37.588
[laughter continues]

15:38.633 --> 15:40.940
Need another one?

15:47.903 --> 15:50.036
Hey, Abby, let me
give you a ride home.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.386
I don't bite.

16:04.876 --> 16:08.315
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

16:15.365 --> 16:19.282
Abby? Honey, what's wrong?

16:34.428 --> 16:37.953
- May I help you?
- Oh, hi.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.565
I gave Abby a ride home from
school, and she dropped this.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.090
What happened to Abby's car?
Did she have an accident?

16:44.133 --> 16:46.135
She had an accident,
didn't she? Was she hurt?

16:46.179 --> 16:50.139
No, it wasn't an accident.
It was just some girls at school.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.621
Again? I knew we should have
sent her to St. Mary's.

16:53.664 --> 16:58.191
Right. Well, tell Abby,
Jo said goodbye.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.196
She's a wreck.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.113
Our poor baby, she keeps saying
that everybody hates her.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.116
I'll buy her some new clothes,
a week at a spa.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.422
Money's not gonna
fix this, Sidney.

17:12.465 --> 17:16.339
She's sobbing her eyes out,
and I don't know what to do.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.429
If only she had some friends.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.443
Listen, Jo, she's devastated.

17:33.487 --> 17:37.360
But it's her senior year,
and I want it to be perfect.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.449
I mean,
just look at that face.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.756
She needs you. We need you.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.410
And we're willing to pay.

17:43.453 --> 17:47.370
- What?
- For you to be her friend.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.547
Two, three, 4,000
to get you started.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.115
- You're crazy.
- Wait, please.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.248
I have more money
than I know what to do with.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.120
And if I can't buy my daughter's happiness,
then what is it worth?

17:58.164 --> 18:02.472
- You can't buy friends.
- OK. Don't call it a friend.

18:02.516 --> 18:08.565
Call it her bodyguard,
guardian angel, fairy god-sister.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.567
There must be
something you want.

18:10.611 --> 18:13.135
Some dream I can
help come true.

18:13.179 --> 18:17.444
A new car?
A trip to Europe? College?

18:18.836 --> 18:21.404
College.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.320
Today's economy,
it's rough out there.

18:24.364 --> 18:29.108
You need money for college,
and it isn't cheap.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.892
- Let me pay for yours.
- Forget it.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.590
Look, just try it out
for 30 days, risk-free.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.810
I guarantee you'll
be happy you did.

18:35.853 --> 18:39.205
And just for trying, I'll buy your
college books for freshman year,

18:39.248 --> 18:44.210
which are yours to keep, no questions asked,
as my little gift to you.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.518
[Jo] Sidney
was pretty convincing,

18:48.562 --> 18:50.520
and I should have
realized why.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.132
He was the king
of infomercials.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.918
He could sell anything from
meat juicers to cat toilets

18:56.961 --> 18:58.963
to my college tuition.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.400
I knew it was crazy.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.619
But Abby'd have
a good senior year,

19:02.663 --> 19:06.797
and I'd get my dream of
Carnegie Mellon University.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.454
I figured, who would it hurt?

19:11.498 --> 19:12.760
[pop music plays]

19:12.803 --> 19:14.370
Four hundred people
already viewed it.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.764
That computer geek
lived up to his promise.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.289
Which is like a rarity in life,
that anyone ever comes through.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.204
Especially fathers and doctors.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.554
Not my legs,
Chastity, my face.

19:24.598 --> 19:28.906
Getting all
red and splotchy. Ugh.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.386
- Uh-oh.
- What?

19:30.430 --> 19:32.867
You're never
gonna believe this.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.390
What do you mean?

19:34.434 --> 19:37.176
Someone posted a link on
your page to another video.

19:37.219 --> 19:41.397
Look, it's that new girl, Jo.
She totally bailed Abby out.

19:41.441 --> 19:45.793
Ugh, who is this girl?
Some bad-ass biker chick?

19:45.836 --> 19:49.231
- There's tons of comments.
- Ugh.

19:49.275 --> 19:53.844
- All the guys think she's hot.
- OK.

19:55.106 --> 19:56.847
So she's hot.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.675
She's well-connected.

19:58.719 --> 20:01.330
I mean, she's
pretty much one of us.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.593
So we'll just need
to make it very clear that,

20:03.637 --> 20:07.293
from here on out, she's only
nice to the people we like.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.731
- Agreed?
- [machine revving]

20:16.040 --> 20:18.869
Mandi, can I get a quote
from you on the school play,

20:18.913 --> 20:21.263
or the lacrosse team, or just,
like, anything, really?

20:21.307 --> 20:24.658
God, I am not up for the
paparazzi this morning.

20:27.574 --> 20:30.272
It's so embarrassing
how much they love me.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.623
I'm Mandi, with an "I."
And you're Jo, right?

20:33.667 --> 20:36.365
- That's me.
- So, Jo, since you're new here,

20:36.409 --> 20:39.803
I thought we'd help you out,
let you know who to hang out with.

20:39.847 --> 20:43.111
- Us.
- [Jo] The real welcoming committee had arrived.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.419
- And who not to.
- [Jo] Did I say "welcoming?"

20:46.462 --> 20:50.771
Uh, oh, wow.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.468
Thanks.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.949
But I think I can
figure that out on my own.

20:54.992 --> 20:59.258
Really? Well, I... I haven't
been impressed so far.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.086
- [Jo] Excuse me?
- But I'm a benevolent dictator,

21:02.130 --> 21:06.961
so why don't we discuss over a non-fat,
no-sugar raspberry Frappuccino

21:07.004 --> 21:09.659
- at the coffee joint?
- We only use Skinny-and-Sweet.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.985
It's like cellulite in a straw,
but without the cellulite.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.969
As scientifically interesting
as that sounds,

21:15.012 --> 21:16.492
I'll have to pass.

21:16.536 --> 21:19.582
Oh, it wasn't a question.
[chuckles]

21:19.626 --> 21:23.543
Oops. Guess I answered anyway.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.763
Oh, my God. Hi.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.592
I'm Quinn Shinn,
editor of the school paper.

21:29.636 --> 21:33.596
That was unbelievable.
Nobody turns Mandi down.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.991
- I just didn't feel like going.
- You're kidding, right?

21:37.034 --> 21:41.212
No, the Plastics are goddesses.
And Mandi can, like, ruin you.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.519
I wrote one article
on school uniforms,

21:43.563 --> 21:46.392
and she put strawberries
in my yogurt.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.132
How horrible for you?

21:48.176 --> 21:50.961
Oh, I had an allergic reaction
to the strawberries,

21:51.005 --> 21:55.314
swelled up like a big Arothron
hispidus. That's a blowfish.

21:55.357 --> 21:57.881
Be careful, Jo.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.320
Thanks, but I'm
not that worried.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.633
[Jo] Hey, what's up?

22:10.677 --> 22:13.636
So you dropped your notebook,
but I gave it back to your dad.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.465
Pretty cool sketches.
Are you an artist?

22:16.509 --> 22:20.817
[stammering] Look, it's cool, I get it.
You don't have to...

22:20.861 --> 22:24.038
- Get what?
- Principal Duvall sent you.

22:24.081 --> 22:27.128
But look, the welcoming committee
was just a stupid idea.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.739
I mean, really, you're the first
new student here in ages,

22:29.783 --> 22:32.351
so you're off the hook.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.876
- Thanks for the ride, though.
- Sure.

22:38.879 --> 22:43.362
Registration
for AP test has closed.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.233
Now...

22:45.276 --> 22:48.410
Uh, now, we all know the
tradition here at North Shore

22:48.454 --> 22:52.762
is to, uh, use
the Homecoming Dance...

22:52.806 --> 22:57.027
...to fund-raise
for charity, OK?

23:00.117 --> 23:01.989
'Cause otherwise you all
would just the think

23:02.032 --> 23:04.513
the world revolves around
you and football.

23:04.557 --> 23:08.038
And it doesn't, OK?

23:08.082 --> 23:09.692
I told you not to walk
in front of...

23:09.736 --> 23:12.303
Babe, I already chose your
tuxedo, rented the limo and...

23:12.347 --> 23:15.350
Oh, red rose corsage,
not a frigging carnation.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.485
- Mandi, you are so winning Homecoming Queen.
- Totally winning.

23:19.528 --> 23:22.618
[Duvall]...the school nurse will
be heading up the blood drive,

23:22.662 --> 23:24.577
- so sign up for that now.
- [laughs] Please.

23:24.620 --> 23:29.103
Like I'm letting that petri dish
of a clinic stick a needle in me.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.888
[girl] I know!
And no matter what I said...

23:31.932 --> 23:36.371
- Hey, uh, do you know where I could catch the bus?
- I think it just left.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.070
Classic. This is why I really
need to fix my bike today.

23:40.114 --> 23:44.684
Do you know any good auto parts shops?
I've gotta get a new spark plug.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.818
Well, I... I think there's Pete's
Auto right next to the coffee joint.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
I could give you
a ride if you want.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.344
I mean, I really
owe you one anyway.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.738
Sweet, thanks.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.182
Oh, look, it's Jo!
Hey, Jo!

24:05.226 --> 24:10.318
- Hey.
- She's with Abby Hanover!

24:10.361 --> 24:11.972
Hi.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.513
[Jo] Thanks for the lift.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.951
Do you wanna come inside?

24:34.995 --> 24:39.173
I'll probably break something,
but... but sure.

24:46.528 --> 24:50.750
- Who's that?
- Um, my mom.

24:51.838 --> 24:54.580
She's really pretty.

24:57.321 --> 25:01.674
Yeah. She was.

25:03.545 --> 25:07.114
- What are these?
- Um...

25:07.157 --> 25:11.684
That's the Sydney Harbor Bridge and
a skyscraper I've been designing.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.600
Kind of hard to tell,
I'm a crappy artist.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.341
- I could help, if you want.
- Really?

25:17.385 --> 25:20.954
Uh, you're pretty talented,
based on those sketches I saw.

25:20.997 --> 25:23.347
You should see
my paintings sometime.

25:23.391 --> 25:26.350
Uh, actually, you don't have to.
It's a bad idea...

25:26.394 --> 25:29.745
No, that'd be really cool.

25:29.789 --> 25:33.575
OK. You ready to
go change a spark plug?

25:33.619 --> 25:38.058
[rhythm and blues
plays on radio]

25:40.930 --> 25:44.586
My gosh,
is that a friend?

25:44.630 --> 25:46.283
Maybe you were right.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.938
Girls aren't
so bad after all.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.798
Hope, what else do we
have on the Virgin Queen?

38:22.822 --> 38:27.217
Well, a 4.5 GPA, high SATs,
three AP classes and...

38:27.261 --> 38:29.872
Oh, she's applying for
architecture scholarships.

38:29.916 --> 38:33.354
Her dream,
Carnegie Mellon University.

38:33.398 --> 38:37.140
- Hm.
- OK, so one more time.

38:37.184 --> 38:41.928
She's never made out
with anyone... ever?

38:41.971 --> 38:44.322
Or this week?

38:46.149 --> 38:48.195
Hey, not so fast.

38:48.238 --> 38:50.980
Uh, today's your lucky day.
We got a sale going on.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.549
- Twenty percent off all grade changes.
- Look, just leave me alone.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.378
Look, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

38:57.422 --> 38:59.249
I was clouded by lust.

38:59.293 --> 39:04.385
And if it helps, I got kicked off
the Web team for abuse of power.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.344
You're still a jerk.

39:06.387 --> 39:09.434
At least your shirt's funny.

39:16.963 --> 39:21.489
Nice fight in the cafeteria.
I could smell the testosterone.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.361
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

39:23.404 --> 39:26.842
Well, it's not your fault that
your dad married Mandi's mom.

39:26.886 --> 39:30.759
But next time, warn me
that you live with Mandi

39:30.803 --> 39:33.371
in a totally platonic way.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.417
Wait, you thought...?

39:36.461 --> 39:38.114
Dude, gross!

39:38.158 --> 39:41.074
[Jo] But despite Quinn
and Abby's urging,

39:41.117 --> 39:43.424
I refused to stoop
to Mandi's level.

39:43.468 --> 39:49.038
Besides, I was having so much fun with
my new friends, I almost didn't care.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.866
You coming?

39:52.651 --> 39:55.958
Who are those girls?
Do they even go to our school?

39:56.002 --> 39:57.802
I was just looking
at the Homecoming Web site,

39:57.830 --> 39:59.875
and everybody's talking
about the hot, new couple.

39:59.919 --> 40:03.444
Nick and I are the
hottest couple in school.

40:03.488 --> 40:05.664
Not anymore.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.982
[Jo] So this was it,
the first challenge.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.289
Success was worth 100 points,

40:22.332 --> 40:26.859
and I needed every point I could
get to qualify for the scholarship.

40:28.861 --> 40:33.474
Boiled egg in the structure.
No breaks, no bruises.

40:33.518 --> 40:36.477
- Ready?
- Ready.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.088
And... drop!

40:43.484 --> 40:46.052
[Giamatti] OK, who
switched the eggs?

40:46.095 --> 40:48.794
Who? No one?

40:52.537 --> 40:56.758
Oh, well. Who's next?

40:56.802 --> 41:00.762
[Jo] Mandi had found a new part of my life to destroy:

41:00.806 --> 41:04.244
my chance at the
Thomson-Bird scholarship.

41:04.287 --> 41:07.465
Our next experiment
didn't go much better.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.989
- You ready?
- Yeah.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.341
Hope called her doctor
on speed dial

41:14.384 --> 41:18.563
and switched our CO2
for laughing gas.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.702
[all] Whoa!

41:36.842 --> 41:39.366
Hey, guys, I'm here.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.673
Seriously, Chastity?

41:41.716 --> 41:44.502
I said "incognito",
not "like a flamingo"!

41:44.545 --> 41:47.156
- Oh.
- Go.

41:51.857 --> 41:55.425
Ew! Ew! Ew! There's poo
on my Jimmy Choo!

41:55.469 --> 41:57.427
Shake it off, shake it off.

41:57.471 --> 41:59.647
Go, slow.

42:00.605 --> 42:01.997
Faster!

42:06.480 --> 42:08.351
Uh, I can't go any further.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.919
What is the matter with you?

42:20.450 --> 42:23.018
Funnel.

42:23.062 --> 42:24.585
The funnel!

42:24.629 --> 42:26.935
- Oh, there you go.
- Right. Secret weapon?

42:26.979 --> 42:30.722
- Oh!
- Hope, a fanny pack, never OK.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.304
Coffee?

43:01.927 --> 43:03.145
Perfect.

43:19.684 --> 43:26.081
- Dad, what's going on?
- It's ruined.

43:26.125 --> 43:29.607
- The whole motor is gummed up.
- What? What happened?

43:29.650 --> 43:32.914
- It was running perfectly yesterday.
- I don't know.

43:32.958 --> 43:36.701
I don't know, maybe
it's the fuel, a faulty part.

43:36.744 --> 43:40.922
It doesn't matter because Jimmy and the
boys are expecting a trial run tomorrow.

43:42.010 --> 43:43.664
Dad...

43:44.534 --> 43:46.188
We can figure something out.

43:46.232 --> 43:49.670
There's not enough time,
and there's not enough money.

43:51.063 --> 43:55.676
Maybe I can call in a favor,
uh, beg for an extension,

43:55.720 --> 43:58.374
tell 'em it was some kind of
fluke accident, I don't know.

44:19.308 --> 44:22.834
[Jo] But this was
definitely no accident.

44:22.877 --> 44:25.575
Mandi had gone too far.

44:25.619 --> 44:27.447
Mess with me, fine.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.884
Mess with my family...

44:29.928 --> 44:32.278
...you're dead.

44:32.321 --> 44:36.761
It was as if all my girl hormones
had kicked into overdrive,

44:36.804 --> 44:39.720
and I was out for blood.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.330
The Plastics were going down,

44:41.374 --> 44:44.986
and I didn't care
what rules I had to break...

44:45.030 --> 44:47.119
...to make her pay.

44:51.036 --> 44:54.126
- What happened?
- Mandi happened.

44:56.389 --> 44:57.912
Is that all you got?

44:57.956 --> 45:02.395
Going after my dad, you spoiled,
narcissistic bitch!

45:02.438 --> 45:06.355
That's his job,
not some play-toy for you!

45:06.399 --> 45:08.401
- But it was so much fun.
- [chuckles]

45:08.444 --> 45:12.927
The way I figure it, no job,
no income, no house, no JoJo.

45:12.971 --> 45:16.714
- Right?
- I don't run away that easy.

45:16.757 --> 45:19.499
Get over yourself, man-hands.

45:19.542 --> 45:21.544
You're just a passing phase.

45:21.588 --> 45:23.198
I'm here for the long run.

45:27.986 --> 45:32.077
Oh, yeah?
Are you sure about that?

45:35.820 --> 45:37.386
[chuckles]

45:40.389 --> 45:43.741
Ooh! Coffee?

45:51.531 --> 45:55.665
Abby, you don't need
to do this with me.

45:55.709 --> 46:00.148
Of course I do.
It's what best friends are for.

46:05.284 --> 46:08.243
There's something
I need to tell you.

46:09.636 --> 46:13.161
[Jo] This was it,
the moment to tell Abby

46:13.205 --> 46:17.557
I'd made a deal with her father that I totally regretted,

46:17.600 --> 46:20.429
and beg for forgiveness.

46:20.473 --> 46:22.257
But looking at her,

46:22.301 --> 46:25.086
the idea of losing my first
best friend in a long time,

46:25.130 --> 46:26.261
I couldn't do it.

46:26.305 --> 46:30.091
So, what do you
need to tell me?

46:32.137 --> 46:36.097
I, um...

46:36.141 --> 46:40.928
You should know, my
last BFF relationship

46:40.972 --> 46:42.887
crashed and burned.

46:42.930 --> 46:46.151
She became snobby
and judgmental

46:46.194 --> 46:49.371
and used guys
as pawns of warfare,

46:49.415 --> 46:51.896
which is saying a lot,
considering it was fourth grade.

46:51.939 --> 46:56.335
[laughs] Geez!
Sounds like a mini-Mandi.

46:56.378 --> 46:58.946
- But don't worry, we're nothing like that.
- [laughs]

46:58.990 --> 47:02.080
Success! OK.

47:02.123 --> 47:05.779
I grabbed all the archived
papers with the Plastics,

47:05.823 --> 47:08.826
which was pretty much
every issue.

47:08.869 --> 47:12.481
- If there's dirt, we'll find it.
- What's this?

47:12.525 --> 47:17.573
Mandi's Annual Birthday Bash.
Everybody wants to be invited.

47:17.617 --> 47:21.926
But, of course, they aren't. Mandi never
allows anybody to throw a party when she does.

47:21.969 --> 47:25.016
Is that so?

47:31.892 --> 47:33.633
[Mandi] I am so excited.

47:33.676 --> 47:36.549
Tonight is gonna
be the perfect night.

47:36.592 --> 47:40.466
It should be.
It's costing my dad enough.

47:40.509 --> 47:42.598
Our dad, Tyler.

47:42.642 --> 47:45.036
You know, most people
would die to be my brother.

47:45.079 --> 47:48.909
That's only because they don't
know what you're really like.

47:48.953 --> 47:52.043
You mean perfect,
awesome and popular?

47:52.086 --> 47:56.699
More like conceited,
vain and vindictive.

47:56.743 --> 47:59.398
You're only happy when
making others miserable.

47:59.441 --> 48:01.313
But high school
will end, Mandi.

48:01.356 --> 48:03.968
And then what
will you have left?

48:12.541 --> 48:15.631
This is a bad idea.
Nobody's gonna show up.

48:15.675 --> 48:18.939
Of course they will. Who wants
to go to some expensive party

48:18.983 --> 48:21.072
with cocktail dresses
and raw fish,

48:21.115 --> 48:23.901
where Mandi talks
about how awesome she is?

48:23.944 --> 48:26.338
People who think
Mandi's awesome.

48:26.381 --> 48:28.427
[sighs] No one
actually thinks that.

48:28.470 --> 48:31.865
Trust me, it's just years
of social brainwashing.

48:33.998 --> 48:37.088
Wait, why aren't
you guys ready? Huh?

48:37.131 --> 48:41.962
- People will arrive any minute!
- We are ready.

48:42.006 --> 48:43.964
No! No!

party clothes for a reason.

48:48.273 --> 48:51.667
Now you don't have an excuse,
because you're actually the host.

48:51.711 --> 48:54.105
Huh? Come on. Come on, come on!
Come on, let's go.

48:54.148 --> 48:56.324
- Come on, sugar, let's go!
- [sighs]

is throwing a party! [giggles]

have this little body forever.

- Mom!
- I'm just saying she oughta show it off.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.953
- Mom, just stop!
- In something like this.

49:15.996 --> 49:18.781
- Ugh! Ilene Hanover!
- Definitely.

49:18.825 --> 49:21.436
[giggles] I knew it!

49:29.314 --> 49:31.620
- Invitation, miss?
- I don't have one.

49:31.664 --> 49:34.014

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:34.947
- It's too bad this didn't come out earlier.
- Why?

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.385
Well, from what I hear, Jo is
a shoo-in for Homecoming Queen.

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:40.474
It's too late for people
to change their votes.

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:46.132
- That is, if she's eligible.
- Eligibility is based on matriculation.

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:51.572
- So she'd have to be expelled or something.
- Oh.

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.533
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

01:07:11.418 --> 01:07:14.856
[Nick] This is gonna be
the best senior prank ever.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.380
The best.

01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:21.820
OK, so tell me again
why we don't keep the money?

01:07:21.863 --> 01:07:24.692
- That's a lot of money.
- Then there's no dance,

01:07:24.736 --> 01:07:27.565
and if there's no dance,
I'm not the queen.

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:31.177
I don't know.

01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:34.050
[sighs] Money can't do this.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:44.625
[engine revving]

01:07:44.669 --> 01:07:47.628
As many of you know,
we had a robbery last night.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:52.024
Now, the evidence strongly
suggests that the thief

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:56.463
was a student, because of his wanton disregard for school property.

01:07:56.507 --> 01:08:00.076
This student, or students,
clearly degenerates,

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:04.341
stole the money that was
intended for helpless animals.

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:06.386
Now, unless
the money is returned,

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:11.391
I have no choice but to cancel the Homecoming Dance.

01:08:11.435 --> 01:08:15.091
- [all muttering]
- This is your principal,

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:16.787
signing off for today,

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:21.096
reminding you to stay left
or right, not center.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:31.237
Miss Mitchell, I received an anonymous
tip today that you stole the money.

01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:34.893
That's a lie.
I would never do that.

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:36.242
Well, apparently you did.

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:39.506
We had a policeman go
to your shed this afternoon.

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:43.596
And I'm afraid we
found the stolen money.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.513
- How did that get there?
- I didn't steal it, I swear!

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:49.125
Somebody must've
put it there, and...

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.952
I would bet anything
it was Mandi.

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:54.434
Well, now, Miss Weatherly
may be the spawn of Satan,

01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:55.870
but unless you have proof,

01:08:55.913 --> 01:08:58.176
there's nothing I can do
except expel you.

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.441
[Jo] It officially
couldn't get much worse.

01:09:01.484 --> 01:09:05.314
I'm also sorry to say that I'm gonna
have to report this to Carnegie Mellon,

01:09:05.358 --> 01:09:07.795
and they very well may
rescind your admission.

01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:12.800
Miss Mitchell, where are
you going? Come back here!

01:09:12.844 --> 01:09:14.684
- Did you hear about Jo?
- I can't believe it.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:16.542
- What a fake.
- I knew it.

01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:20.286
I knew it all along,
and I tried to warn people.

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:22.767
I tried to protect
you all from her.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.857
- Mandi, you are like a saint.
- Yeah, a total saint.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.426
- Oh, yeah, a real martyr.
- You mean a real bitch!

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:33.169
Wait. As much as we all might like that,
I can't let it happen.

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:36.823
This is crazy! Shouldn't she be
locked up in juvie or something?

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:38.738
Girls, why don't we
settle this like ladies...

01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:40.828
Screw being ladies,
and screw being girls!

01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:44.484
I'm sick of the mind games and
the backstabbing and the set-ups.

01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:47.618
I know you framed me, Mandi.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:52.274
So we're gonna settle this
like men, on the battlefield.

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:54.755
- Oh, please.
- That's right.

01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.192
I challenge you...

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.503
...to a football game,

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:06.332
- Powder Puff style.
- No way.

01:10:06.376 --> 01:10:08.856
I... I don't do sports.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.337
Aw, you scared?

01:10:11.381 --> 01:10:14.601
Can't take the heat, Mandi?

01:10:14.645 --> 01:10:17.213
I thought you were
the best at everything.

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:22.218
I thought people trembled in
the presence of the Plastics.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:23.915
You wanna win?

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:29.312
The only way you're gonna
become queen is by default.

01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:36.841
Fine, you're on.

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:39.191
But be prepared to lose.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.238
You know, you
and your team of one.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:54.554
[Jo] I realized a little too late
that I no longer had any friends.

01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:59.777
But if I had to take on all the
Plastics by myself, I would.

01:11:07.175 --> 01:11:10.657
All right, let's get to class, everybody... 
Hang out in the hallway.

01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:14.095
- Do you really think she did it?
- I don't know anymore.

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.923
Certainly not about Jo.

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:32.375
Hey, Mr. Hanover, this was in our mailbox.
It's for you.

01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:36.030
- Listen, you're Jo's boyfriend, right?
- Ex-boyfriend.

01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:39.338
Huh, awkward.

01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:41.795
Thing is, I've got something for Jo.
It's the money, actually.

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:45.649
Would you give it to her? A deal's a deal.
It's not her fault Abby found out.

01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:51.350
- She gave the money back to you?
- Of course.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.047
I was expecting it, really.

01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:55.354
I knew she'd love Abby
once she got to know her.

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:57.008
I just needed
to make that happen.

01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:59.073
So remember, you can't wear
red or pink to the dance.

01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:00.988
Those are my colors.
And I'm wearing my hair up,

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:03.884
'cause it's best for the crown,
so wear yours down.

01:12:03.928 --> 01:12:08.367
- Quinn, are you listening?
- Yes, absolutely. Hair down.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:14.982
Hey, Abby.

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:19.291
- Look, just don't.
- But...

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:22.468
You know, Jo may
have lied to me,

01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:24.427
but at least she
taught me one thing.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:28.866
Stand up for myself.
So... get lost, Quinn.

01:12:28.909 --> 01:12:31.738
Fine, hate me.

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:36.090
But you should know I don't
think Jo stole the money.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:38.223
I think Mandi did.

01:12:38.266 --> 01:12:41.705
- How do you know?
- Because I sort of gave her

01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:44.664
the idea to get Jo expelled.

01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:50.844
Also, Jo spent an awful lot
of time putting together

01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:54.761
and sending out college
applications for you.

01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:58.461
She even put together
your portfolio.

01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:06.425
I helped her make about a dozen of
those with journalism equipment.

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:10.821
I hope you get
into art school, Abby.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:12.649
I really do.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.666
[grunts]

01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.583
So Mr. Hanover just called.

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:37.543
Apparently, one of his distributors
is sending new parts for the engine.

01:13:38.762 --> 01:13:41.199
That's great, right?

01:13:41.242 --> 01:13:45.421
We can finish the car in time
for Jimmy and the new racer.

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:48.598
So, you, uh...
You heard from Abby?

01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:52.645
I've texted, called.

01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:56.127
I tried her
NorthShoreCentric page.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:14:01.611
No luck. That girl
really hates my guts.

01:14:01.654 --> 01:14:06.267
But I can't blame her.
I'm not sure why you don't hate me.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:11.316
Listen, kid, I'm not proud
of what you did to Abby,

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:14.101
but I know
that you care about her.

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:18.976
- And you're certainly not a thief.
- At least someone believes me.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:22.370
[doors closing]

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:24.938
Oh, I don't
think it's just me.

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:35.471
- Am I seeing things?
- We haven't forgiven you yet.

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:37.081
Not even close.

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:42.652
But we can't let you
take the fall for Mandi.

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:46.525
- That's right, we've got your back.
- Mandi's goin' down.

01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:48.309
- [all chuckling]
- I knew it.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:51.008
I knew Mandi set me up, and...

01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:54.054
...you guys came to rescue me.

01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:58.363
I don't deserve you.

01:14:58.406 --> 01:15:00.887
Oh, my God, are you crying?

01:15:00.931 --> 01:15:05.196
- No, I never cry.
- [laughs]

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:09.374
All right, now come on,
we have a game to prepare for.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:12.551
And you're right,
Mandi needs her ass kicked.

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:14.901
And we have an idea
to prove your innocence.

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:40.579
- Do you think you can do it?
- Hack into their security system?

01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:44.322
Not easy, but not impossible.
I just have to detect their wireless signal,

01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:47.194
then hack into their computer
and find their security account.

01:15:47.238 --> 01:15:49.588
- Uh, wait, got it.
- [beeping]

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:52.286
They named their Wi-Fi
"AlwaysWatching?"

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:54.288
What's their
pass code, "“666?"”

01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:57.944
It'll take a few days, but if
Mandi planted the evidence,

01:15:57.988 --> 01:15:59.859
I'll find the footage.

01:15:59.903 --> 01:16:03.950
But... I want
something in return.

01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:06.126
I knew it. I knew
he wouldn't do it for free.

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.607
What do you
want, Elliot?

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:12.176
A date to the dance,
with Abby.

01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:19.966
Oh, um, hey, good luck at the game.
I'll be rooting for you.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:22.665
Uh, even got my
own side biz going on.

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:25.232
Odds are 30 to one
in Mandi's favor.

01:16:25.276 --> 01:16:28.584
- What? Why?
- You haven't heard?

01:16:28.627 --> 01:16:33.240
[Jo] Mandi had managed to recruit
the captain of the rugby team...

01:16:34.459 --> 01:16:38.594
...a fifth-year senior
who felt no pain...

01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:43.729
...and the three-time Junior Division
Karate Champion onto her team.

01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:47.167
But we weren't backing down.

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:49.909
And neither was Mandi.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.433
She wasn't going
to pull any punches.

01:16:52.477 --> 01:16:55.611
It was time to end this
once and for all.

01:17:02.705 --> 01:17:05.098
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.926
Good!

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.799
Hi, baby!
Oh, you look so cute.

01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:13.324
- Our little athlete.
- Mom, Dad, come on. You know you can't be in here.

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:16.544
- Just go.
- You're right, you're right. We need to find a seat.

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:20.113
- The bleachers are already filling up.
- Yay! Yay!

01:17:23.116 --> 01:17:27.512
- I'm gonna vomit.
- It's gonna be OK, I promise.

01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:30.384
- What's the worst that could happen?
- [all] We lose?

01:17:30.428 --> 01:17:33.692
- [knocking on door]
- Is everybody decent in here?

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:36.913
I don't want a sexual
harassment lawsuit... again.

01:17:36.956 --> 01:17:38.479
- [all] Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:40.675
Principal Duvall, what are you
doing here on a weekend?

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:43.659
Well, I've tried to turn
a blind eye to this game,

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:46.662
but the fact that you made
the challenge in my presence,

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:51.057
and you've plastered the school
with posters made that kinda hard.

01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:54.104
Thought you guys would wimp out.

01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:56.497
But I guess now
I will have to intervene.

01:17:56.541 --> 01:18:00.110
Mainly because Mandi's team
wants to file a lawsuit.

01:18:00.153 --> 01:18:03.417
- What are you talking about?
- Jo, due to your expulsion,

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:05.724
you are not allowed
on school grounds.

01:18:05.768 --> 01:18:07.639
Thus, you cannot play the game.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:12.035
- Damn it! Mandi was counting on this.
- I know.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:15.647
- You know?
- Yep, which is why I looked into this issue days ago.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.344
You know, technically,

01:18:17.388 --> 01:18:20.739
the football field is public
property since it's on park land.

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:23.002
You know, the school
only rents it for games.

01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:27.528
So all we needed was a permit,
which I have right here.

01:18:27.572 --> 01:18:30.357
Oh! Well, great then.

01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:34.318
I guess you are just not
allowed in the locker room.

01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:38.365
Oh. See ya!

01:18:38.409 --> 01:18:40.977
Well, I guess my
job here is done.

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.327
Ha-ha! Let's go, team!

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:46.199
Kill! Maim! Dismember.

01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:50.943
- [cheering]

01:30:50.314 --> 01:30:52.882
Tyler decided to go
to Penn State,

01:30:52.925 --> 01:30:57.843
which, by total coincidence,
was only a few hours away from my school.

01:30:57.887 --> 01:30:59.715
As for me, I managed to earn

01:30:59.758 --> 01:31:03.240
my Carnegie Mellon tuition
with Sidney's help after all.

01:31:03.283 --> 01:31:05.851
The man could truly
sell anything,

01:31:05.895 --> 01:31:07.679
even my shop class project.

01:31:07.723 --> 01:31:10.987
A birdhouse and
security camera, all in one.

01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:12.989
Only $19.99.

01:31:13.032 --> 01:31:15.905
Mr. Hanover even compromised
on Abby majoring in art,

01:31:15.948 --> 01:31:19.865
so long as she went to a top college,
which worked out perfectly for me.

01:31:19.909 --> 01:31:22.041
- So how does it look?
- Nice crown.

01:31:22.085 --> 01:31:24.087
Thanks. I thought it
went with the t-shirt.

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:26.263
[both chuckle]

01:31:26.306 --> 01:31:29.309
[Jo] So I guess my dad
was right after all.

01:31:29.353 --> 01:31:32.095
To win the race,
you have to be in the race.

01:31:32.138 --> 01:31:36.882
Sometimes it just takes a little girl
drama to find out who your friends are.

01:31:36.926 --> 01:31:42.061
And, once you have that, you
can survive almost anything...

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:45.282
- ...even high school.
