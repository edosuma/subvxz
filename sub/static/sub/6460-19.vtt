WEBVTT

00:02.535 --> 00:04.236
Here's your check.

00:04.238 --> 00:07.039
Sorry about the
entire experience.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.440
Ugh.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.309
You're gonna have to take it
the rest of the way.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.811
I slept funny
last year.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.847
You know, I happen to be
a massage therapist,

00:14.849 --> 00:18.017
and I happen to be broke,
so what do you say

00:18.019 --> 00:20.285
I get that crick
out of your neck as your tip?

00:20.287 --> 00:23.589
I miss being able
to just say no.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.190
Hold on, I have to run this
by a person

00:25.192 --> 00:27.059
who's been poor longer.

00:27.061 --> 00:31.230
Sadly, that guy over there is
offering me a massage as a tip.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.432
Sadly-er, I'm considering it.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.635
Sadly-est, you were here
when that old woman punched me

00:36.637 --> 00:40.439
in the breast and then
asked for change, right?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.141
We're not doing great.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.010
There's got to be somebody
doing worse than you two.

00:45.012 --> 00:49.248
Like that guy who got left
on Mars last year.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.449
Question, girls.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.317
I'm making a healthier menu.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.687
Should I advertise no trans fat,
or does that sound like

00:55.689 --> 01:00.626
I'm trying to keep out
Chaz Bono?

01:00.628 --> 01:03.796
Not now, Han,
I have a massage scheduled.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.165
All the stress of acting
like you're working

01:06.167 --> 01:07.800
starting to get to you?

01:11.037 --> 01:12.237
Oh.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.239
OLEG: Oh.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.808
Oh, yeah.

01:15.810 --> 01:18.043
Oh, yeah.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.012
Oh, yeah!

01:20.014 --> 01:23.048
Oh yeah.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.583
Yes!
OLEG: Yeah.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.719
Oh, yes!
OLEG: (moaning)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.021
Yes!

01:29.023 --> 01:30.422
Oh...yes!

01:30.424 --> 01:31.657
Yes! Yes!

01:31.659 --> 01:33.926
(bell ringing)
CAROLINE: Yes, yes, yes!

01:33.928 --> 01:35.828
(squealing)

01:35.830 --> 01:38.831
(bell ringing)

01:42.302 --> 01:44.970
I just had
what she's having.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.475
<i>(Peter Bjorn and John)</i>
<i>♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:50.676
<i>(cash register bell dings)</i>

01:50.678 --> 01:55.447
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

02:00.286 --> 02:01.487
Max, are you busy right now?

02:01.489 --> 02:04.223
- No, I'm at work.
- Cool.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.024
I'm gonna call
a staff meeting.

02:06.026 --> 02:09.228
I used to call my driver to pick
up sushi during <i>Gilmore Girls,</i>

02:09.230 --> 02:12.097
but now I call
staff meetings at a diner.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.699
Hey!

02:13.701 --> 02:17.402
Only I can call staff meetings
at the diner.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.471
It's one of the perks
of the job.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.207
Well, it's the perk
of the job.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.643
Well, it's okay.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.612
The staff meeting
is about the dessert bar

02:26.614 --> 02:28.480
Max and I are opening
in our cupcake window.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.516
If you want, Han,
you can call the meeting,

02:30.518 --> 02:32.217
but I can't imagine
you'd be petty enough

02:32.219 --> 02:33.852
to take the thrill
away from Caroline.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.255
Staff meeting!

02:36.257 --> 02:37.589
See, this is what happens

02:37.591 --> 02:42.027
when the mother cat
refuses to lick the runt.

02:42.029 --> 02:45.097
Okay, so I'm checking
on the dessert bar assignments

02:45.099 --> 02:46.398
I gave everyone.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.900
Earl, did you call your cousin

02:47.902 --> 02:50.002
at that liquor distributor
about getting us a discount?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.470
Now, why would I call him?

02:51.472 --> 02:56.008
I owe him $10,000
and a kidney.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.976
So that's a "not yet."

02:57.978 --> 02:59.678
I haven't done
my thing, either.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.447
(laughs)

03:02.449 --> 03:04.816
Caroline, with all your money
from Hollywood,

03:04.818 --> 03:07.252
you could pay other people
to do this stuff...

03:07.254 --> 03:10.989
and also replace the
transmission on a 2012 Yaris.

03:10.991 --> 03:14.793
We have to save all our movie
money for the dessert bar.

03:14.795 --> 03:18.463
Believe it or not, my boobs
can't get us zoning permits.

03:18.465 --> 03:21.934
But they did get us kicked out
of an architect's office.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.336
Oleg, did you talk to your
connection at City Hall

03:24.338 --> 03:25.804
about expediting
our liquor license?

03:25.806 --> 03:29.007
Yes, she told me,
"Don't ever sneak into my home

03:29.009 --> 03:31.877
through the bathroom
window again."

03:31.879 --> 03:33.612
Oh, this is rich.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.981
Now you two see
some of the hell I go through

03:35.983 --> 03:37.416
as a small business owner.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.484
No, you go through hell
'cause nobody wants to

03:39.486 --> 03:43.922
see your small business.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.924
Staff meeting over!

03:45.926 --> 03:48.227
Small staff meeting.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.628
Max, your boyfriend
is a lawyer.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.063
When you're at his
hotel tonight,

03:51.065 --> 03:52.864
can you ask him to look
at our liquor license?

03:52.866 --> 03:55.133
Also, could you fill an
ice bucket with mini shampoos

03:55.135 --> 03:56.335
and bring it home?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.836
No on both counts.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.905
You're not using Randy
for legal advice.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.207
And as for the shampoo,
they switched to a pump

04:02.209 --> 04:06.011
bolted to the wall,
'cause I was getting greedy.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.679
Hey, Randy.

04:07.681 --> 04:08.714
Hey, Earl.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.716
Saw your rant on Twitter
last night.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.252
And I agree;
what self-respecting Sizzler

04:13.254 --> 04:14.987
runs out of Sprite?

04:14.989 --> 04:16.722
I put that on Twitter?

04:16.724 --> 04:19.925
I thought I was writing
an email to my brother.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.495
Hey there, beautiful.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.497
Mm.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.669
So I thought we'd try
something different tonight.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.738
You on top?

04:32.740 --> 04:34.806
No, I'm not talking
about changing

04:34.808 --> 04:37.342
our whole power dynamic.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.711
I'm talking about staying
at your apartment.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.514
So, you on bottom?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.650
'Cause that's where I live.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.984
No, really.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.420
We're living in a fantasy world,
that hotel room.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.389
I mean, a really
sexy fantasy world,

04:50.391 --> 04:52.357
with people cleaning up after us

04:52.359 --> 04:54.526
and a maid who knew you
from high school.

04:54.528 --> 04:59.364
Boy, was she surprised
to see me naked and alive.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.767
I know I always am.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.935
And Max, I've been
to your apartment.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.270
It wasn't that bad.

05:05.272 --> 05:08.173
Uh, okay, fine.
We can stay at my place.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.708
But it's BYOC.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.844
Bring your own
carbon monoxide detector.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.417
Well, here we are.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.919
Slum, sweet slum.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.121
She says that every time
she walks in here.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.891
It's usually to scare the crack
addict out of our kitchen.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.261
Allen, are you here?

05:29.263 --> 05:31.196
All right,
well, this is it.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.597
What do you want to do now?

05:32.599 --> 05:35.734
We usually go to sleep
so death comes sooner.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.470
RANDY: You guys,
I can handle an apartment.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.172
Don't let my
broad shoulders, stubble,

05:40.174 --> 05:43.575
and Adam's apple confuse you;
I am, in fact, a man.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.211
Coming up straight ahead
is the kitchen.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.546
But I don't have to
tell you that.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.681
You can smell the gas.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.552
Fun fact: those paper towels
you see aren't actually paper,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.887
but they do cause cancer.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.089
(knocking)

05:57.091 --> 05:58.790
Ooh, let me guess:
the Grim Reaper?

05:58.792 --> 06:02.327
No, the Grim Reaper comes on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.365
Hey, girls.

06:10.002 --> 06:13.705
And Randy.
Oh.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.275
Someone's been taking
his handsome pills.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.511
Well, they make them
in chewable now.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.080
Makes it a lot easier.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.281
Oh, Randy's here?

06:23.283 --> 06:25.517
Hey, hey, hey, bro.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.985
We should hang
upstairs later.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.855
We can eat pizza
and watch dirty movies.

06:29.857 --> 06:33.925
It's not delivery;
it's DiPorno.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.628
That's a hard no.

06:36.630 --> 06:40.832
Girls, we need to store
some stuff in your place.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.935
Oleg and I are baby-proofing
our apartment.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.338
My mom baby-proofed
our house for me.

06:46.340 --> 06:49.141
She put a club
on the steering wheel.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.176
So in this duffle bag,
I have--

06:51.178 --> 06:52.377
He's opening it!

06:52.379 --> 06:53.879
Randy, close your eyes!

06:53.881 --> 06:55.247
Relax.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.882
It's just swords

06:56.884 --> 06:58.650
and sex toys.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.886
Oh, I think
one of them's both.

07:00.888 --> 07:05.023
Are you referring
to sex-calibur?

07:05.025 --> 07:07.692
Oh, I love this one.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.294
This is the sword we used

07:09.296 --> 07:13.331
when we were playing
Bonan the Barbarian.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.766
SOPHIE: And you know what?

07:14.768 --> 07:18.270
It's good to give to
the less sexually fortunate.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.604
Yeah.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.707
The sex toys are for you,
Caroline.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.610
I'm good,
I had a massage.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.884
Hiya!

07:32.886 --> 07:34.953
What are you doing?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.722
This is how all the great ninjas
eat their bagels.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.057
CAROLINE: Where's Randy?

07:39.059 --> 07:42.227
Did he go back to the
land of not-expired milk,

07:42.229 --> 07:43.829
and not-expired honey?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.797
No, he's stronger
than I thought.

07:45.799 --> 07:49.167
Much like that little person
I arm wrestled at Chelsea Piers.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.671
I love it here.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.940
I just took the grayest shower
of my life.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.876
Did you just say "grayest"
or "greatest"?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.077
No, I said gray.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.479
I was being kind.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.214
It was brown.

08:02.216 --> 08:05.684
All right, well, come on,
your sword bagel is ready.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.753
God, I do miss having sex.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.556
Also, what is the deal with--

08:11.558 --> 08:13.558
Oh!
God! Oh!

08:13.560 --> 08:15.327
Ugh, I just stepped on
something painful.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.262
Really painful!

08:17.264 --> 08:19.397
Is there a nail sticking up
through the floor?

08:19.399 --> 08:20.732
[gasps]

08:20.734 --> 08:22.834
Oh no, he stepped on
Nail Patrick Harris!

08:22.836 --> 08:26.104
Oh, I forgot to warn you
about that stupid nail.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.673
It's been there forever.
I just know to avoid it by now.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.242
Everyone does;
that's why we named it

08:30.244 --> 08:32.077
"Nail Patrick Harris."

08:32.079 --> 08:33.311
Are you okay?

08:33.313 --> 08:34.679
You look like you're
in a lot of pain.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.881
Do you want to roll the dice

08:35.883 --> 08:37.382
with one of the pills
in the couch?

08:37.384 --> 08:38.683
I'm fine.
It's not that bad.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.886
Okay, well lift up your foot.
Let me see.

08:40.888 --> 08:43.889
(grunting)

08:48.928 --> 08:49.961
(screaming)

08:49.963 --> 08:52.230
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

08:53.799 --> 08:55.000
Randy?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.435
This is bad.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.739
I think we have to
take you to Hapitalito.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.741
Well, I must be losing
consciousness.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.042
That sounded like gibberish.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.777
No, you heard me right,
I said Hapitalito.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.279
That's our
healthcare provider.

09:07.281 --> 09:09.581
It's a guy with a shopping cart
filled with Band-Aids,

09:09.583 --> 09:10.782
and most of them
aren't used.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.918
Max, I have insurance.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
Well, I don't think
he takes insurance,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.422
but if you have
old TCBY cards,

09:17.424 --> 09:20.091
five is good for
"uno surgeria."

09:20.093 --> 09:22.627
Well, maybe it stopped.

09:22.629 --> 09:25.830
(screaming)

09:28.568 --> 09:31.770
I'm Carrie!
I'm Carrie at the prom!

09:33.005 --> 09:35.140
Caroline, come on,
we have to go.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.276
I'm already covered in blood.
Just leave me to die.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.778
MAX: Oh, calm down!

09:39.780 --> 09:42.113
If this had happened with
any of my regular type of guys,

09:42.115 --> 09:44.749
you'd be halfway to
Hep C right now.

09:47.286 --> 09:48.753
Help! Help!

09:48.755 --> 09:50.655
My apartment tried
to kill my boyfriend!

09:50.657 --> 09:51.856
He's gonna die!

09:51.858 --> 09:53.992
I'm not gonna die,
Max.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.994
Although, this CVS bag
you tied around my foot

09:55.996 --> 09:57.729
has completely cut off
the circulation.

09:57.731 --> 10:01.166
And the ten-foot receipt's
caught in the wound.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.603
My boyfriend needs
medical attention.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.137
Oh, really?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.473
I thought he was here
for a sensible pantsuit

10:08.475 --> 10:11.309
at a reasonable price.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.979
Oh, I recognize you

10:13.981 --> 10:15.847
from the last time
we were in here.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.482
I wasn't attracted to you then,

10:17.484 --> 10:20.452
but I see you've added balding
and a beard to the mix.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.721
Ha, ha,
I remember you too.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.423
The devil wears Target.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.525
We need a good doctor,

10:27.527 --> 10:30.795
so he better not
be from America.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.430
'Cause he has insurance.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.032
Show him the card, Randy.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.233
(gasps)

10:35.235 --> 10:36.968
Could I touch it?

10:39.572 --> 10:42.073
Oh, good for you, a PPO.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.543
You know, I cleaned up
some PPO right there.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.479
Come on, this is serious!

10:47.481 --> 10:49.714
He might have "Tetris"!

10:49.716 --> 10:53.752
He's got the beloved
Russian puzzle game?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.754
Are you sure he doesn't
have a case of the

10:55.756 --> 10:58.256
Super Mario Brothers?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.859
Well, there's a lot
of people ahead of you,

11:00.861 --> 11:03.094
so why don't you take
your boyfriend's boo boo

11:03.096 --> 11:04.629
and sit down?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.097
Fine.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.466
But he better not die,
'cause if he does,

11:08.468 --> 11:12.203
I'm gonna take those buttons
and pin them to your sack.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.739
Promise?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.742
Damn it!

11:17.744 --> 11:19.344
I guess we're gonna
be here forever.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.014
The exact amount of time
Caroline's shower took.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.949
Oh, so it's my fault
your boyfriend

11:24.951 --> 11:27.752
Freddy Krueger-ed
all over me?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.688
Caroline, I am so sorry.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.955
That's okay, Randy.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.357
You can make it up to me.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.892
Right now!

11:33.894 --> 11:36.061
I just so happen to have our
liquor license application,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.896
if you want to
take a look-see.

11:37.898 --> 11:41.099
Do you also want to be pinned to
that albino's sack, Caroline?

11:44.503 --> 11:46.237
Okay, coming through.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.872
Okay, let me clear a path.

11:50.776 --> 11:54.612
Now I know how
my grandma Dorothy felt.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.814
Oh, good, you're back.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.248
Randy,
are you okay?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.383
Oh, I'm fine.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.452
Did some shopping
after you left the ER.

12:00.454 --> 12:03.288
Like my new bag?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.522
Ooh.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.790
If you need
a clutch to match,

12:05.792 --> 12:09.060
I have something
similar in Ziploc.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.930
Because the nail was rusted
and the open wound

12:11.932 --> 12:15.066
touched our floor, they gave
Randy an IV of antibiotics.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.570
And not even a whisper
of Vicodin for old Maxie.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.805
Well, Max, one of us
has to go to work

12:20.807 --> 12:22.774
and pretend
both of us are there.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.975
Well, it's gonna
have to be you.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.610
I can't leave Randy here.

12:25.612 --> 12:29.647
It's like a haunted house,
but the dangers are real.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.916
Max, you're
going to work.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.585
I'll be fine here.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.488
I had a time-share
with Sean Penn.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.425
I'm not going anywhere.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.627
It's my fault you got
nailed in my apartment,

12:42.629 --> 12:45.296
and I'm staying here
to protect you.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.398
You're going to work.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.033
I'll be okay.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.002
But you're very cute
when you're worried.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.505
Like when you thought the hotel
didn't get Cartoon Network.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.107
All right, fine.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.143
But call me if you
need me to come back.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.045
I'll tell Han I'm working
the rest of my shift from home.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.150
Oh, my God!

13:05.152 --> 13:06.718
I just remembered
I didn't tell Randy

13:06.720 --> 13:08.219
about the pothole
in my bedroom.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.954
Max, relax.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.256
I haven't seen you
this anxious

13:11.258 --> 13:13.258
since the Dominos
pizza tracker went down.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.592
Look, woman!

13:14.594 --> 13:17.061
Randy came to New York to see if
our relationship could work,

13:17.063 --> 13:18.596
but we never should have
left that hotel.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.865
It's like when you go to Vegas
and wander off the strip

13:20.867 --> 13:22.734
and wind up in a
residential neighborhood.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.369
You can't come back
from that.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.939
It's how I wound up living
two years in someone's shed.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.208
I suppose the motivational
newsletter

13:30.210 --> 13:32.343
I sent out this morning
didn't do any good.

13:32.345 --> 13:36.781
I don't even know why I bother
publishing <i>What's Going Han?</i>

13:36.783 --> 13:40.351
I like the comic strip
about the fat squirrel.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.887
That picture was me!

13:42.889 --> 13:45.957
It can't be you;
he had nuts.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.626
And that lady
at table four ordered

13:48.628 --> 13:52.030
before she started knitting
that sweater she's now wearing.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.834
(cell phone rings)

13:55.836 --> 13:57.035
Oh, good, it's Randy.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.636
Hey, I forgot to tell you,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.071
you can't drink the tap water

14:00.073 --> 14:02.707
within five minutes after
flushing the toilet.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.243
Well, can you
make yourself throw up?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.244
(bell dings)

14:06.246 --> 14:09.047
Pickup:
breakfast burrito.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.282
Randy called our landlord

14:11.284 --> 14:13.384
to complain about
Nail Patrick Harris!

14:13.386 --> 14:16.821
I'd rather see him host
something than Ricky Gervais.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.824
We get it: you're mean,
you fat bastard.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.026
Randy called the landlord?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.728
But we're illegal subletters!

14:23.730 --> 14:25.530
We're squatters there!

14:25.532 --> 14:27.332
And over most toilets.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.500
Come on, Caroline,
we have to get to the apartment

14:29.502 --> 14:31.636
before the landlord does.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.904
You're leaving?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.073
The tollbooth operator
who won Powerball

14:35.075 --> 14:37.275
stayed at their job longer.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.880
Randy, we got to go!

14:41.882 --> 14:44.148
I'll start packing!
You saddle up Chestnut.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.850
Yeah, I know the drill:
one pair of shoes,

14:45.852 --> 14:47.218
something you can carry
on your back,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.620
and a sun hat for Guatemala--

14:48.622 --> 14:50.622
I mean, wherever we're headed.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.392
Randy, you better drink up
the rest of the that IV fluid,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.527
'cause carrying that around
is just gonna slow us down.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.962
Max, what in the hell
is going on?

14:57.964 --> 14:59.264
Why are you freaking out?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.132
I called the landlord
about a nail,

15:01.134 --> 15:03.668
not the FBI about
your passport...

15:03.670 --> 15:06.104
Frank Delaport.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.640
Randy, we're not on the lease
to this apartment.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.275
Oh...

15:10.277 --> 15:12.110
Okay, I'm ready.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.045
I just need ten minutes
to saddle up Chestnut.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.614
It'll give me time
to practice my accent.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.016
We're totally screwed now.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.384
Thanks a lot.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.586
This is why we should have
stayed in the hotel.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.123
You could have screwed me there
and I would have loved it.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.557
Max, I just didn't want you

15:26.559 --> 15:28.860
to live with a nail
sticking out of your floor,

15:28.862 --> 15:30.328
and I knew you wouldn't
fix it yourself.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.163
What is that
supposed to mean?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.364
It's like you don't realize

15:33.366 --> 15:34.999
you don't have to
live like this.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.367
Oh, great.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.902
It's like I'm
in a relationship

15:37.904 --> 15:40.371
with my high school
guidance counselor.

15:42.474 --> 15:45.009
Again.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.746
You know, your life
can be a whole lot better

15:48.748 --> 15:50.048
than you think it can be.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.016
Why don't you just
hammer the nail in?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.452
Because we are used to it.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.256
We just ignore it,
like the rain in my bedroom.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.658
I knew my apartment
would be too real for you,

16:00.660 --> 16:03.127
and now it's not even
gonna be my apartment.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.365
All right, Max.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.200
I put the double saddle
on Chestnut,

16:09.202 --> 16:10.768
filled the satchel
with trail mix.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.905
That should get us to the
George Washington Bridge.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.840
(knocking)

16:15.842 --> 16:18.109
Nobody has to go anywhere.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.712
Not even your friend,
the giant piñata.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.182
- Let me deal with this.
MAX: But...

16:24.184 --> 16:25.249
we've never met this guy!

16:25.251 --> 16:26.651
All we know about him

16:26.653 --> 16:29.087
is that even the guy in 2A
is afraid of him,

16:29.089 --> 16:32.090
and he was married to
Kirstie Alley.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.691
I can handle myself.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.960
Hand me my fluids.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.997
That sounded not manly.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.734
RANDY: Hey, sport,
thanks for coming.

16:44.403 --> 16:45.837
He can't talk his way
out of this.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.205
He's wasting his time.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.906
He might as well be
trying to teach shapes

16:48.908 --> 16:50.808
to Kendall Jenner.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.011
RANDY:
No, no, you listen!

16:54.079 --> 16:56.714
Well, Randy's dead.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.418
No matter how many boyfriends
I bury, it's never easy.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.021
I can't believe we're
getting kicked out like this.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.856
In my fantasy,
I bought the building

17:04.858 --> 17:06.758
and opened a sadness museum.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.662
Okay, that's it.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.864
Took care of the landlord.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.700
You killed him?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.702
I'll call Oleg;
we'll get his friend's truck

17:17.704 --> 17:19.303
and take it from here.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.973
Okay, first,
I believe that you have

17:21.975 --> 17:25.076
and would cover up a murder.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.277
But nobody's dead.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.912
I just explained to him
the situation,

17:27.914 --> 17:29.313
and you're not
getting kicked out.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.049
All right, which one of us
has to marry him?

17:31.051 --> 17:34.419
I'll go get my
wedding sweatpants.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.954
I just explained to him
that I'm a lawyer

17:36.956 --> 17:38.756
who sustained an injury
on his property.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.192
Then I mentioned the faulty
wiring, the gas leak,

17:41.194 --> 17:42.760
the various wildlife
living here,

17:42.762 --> 17:45.496
and, oh--
that I'm a lawyer.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.833
The word "lawyer" makes
people crap their pants.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.203
It's like the juice cleanse
of professions.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.273
And that is why you get
the next two months rent-free,

17:55.275 --> 17:56.941
and you are now officially
on the lease.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.876
- (gasps)
- We're on the lease?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.078
We're legit?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.879
I have never been legit.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.281
According to my birth
certificate,

18:03.283 --> 18:06.084
I'm actually
a Cabbage Patch doll.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.485
Thank you so much, Randy.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.320
I'm gonna go tell Chestnut
the good news.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.721
CAROLINE: Chestnut!

18:10.723 --> 18:12.123
How about that?

18:12.125 --> 18:15.626
Your new name
doesn't have to be Pablo.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.061
Thank you.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.529
I don't know what
she would have done.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.065
She is not made
for the streets.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.835
She's not even made
for polyester.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.370
This is awkward.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.907
Just trying to get a horse
out of a tiny doorway.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.576
All right, up.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.578
I have to get back
to the hotel.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.513
Have you seen
my protective bootie?

18:35.515 --> 18:38.850
Wait, why are you taking your
booties back to the hotel?

18:38.852 --> 18:41.919
Well, you're obviously not
comfortable with me being here.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.855
No one's comfortable
being here.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.389
It's here.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.593
Look, Max.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.761
I wanted to stay here because
I wanted to see how you live.

18:50.763 --> 18:54.565
Now I know you live on an
Indian food burial ground.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.969
You know what?
You're right.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.338
My life can be better.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.941
We don't have hammer money
yet, so...

19:03.943 --> 19:07.678
(pounding)

19:07.680 --> 19:09.280
You know what time it is?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.449
It's hammer time!

19:11.451 --> 19:13.985
Well, that's the end of
Nail Patrick Harris.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.419
Are you kidding?

19:15.421 --> 19:18.756
With charisma like that,
he's not going anywhere.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.692
I think we just got through
our first fight.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.494
And only one of us
had to go to the hospital,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.196
so I think that's
pretty good.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.398
I think that is pretty good.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.934
You know what else I think?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.336
I love you.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.872
I love you too.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.875
CAROLINE: Aw!

19:37.877 --> 19:39.410
That is so sweet.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.811
I'll give you two
some privacy.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.213
I'll be in my room.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.584
Caroline...

19:46.586 --> 19:49.954
Even as a mime,
you're still hot.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.256
While you were at work,
I filled out your application

19:52.258 --> 19:54.225
for the liquor license.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.495
Randy, I love you too.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.765
Sorry, the walls are thin,
and I was listening.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.034
(knocking)

20:03.036 --> 20:04.702
Hey, girls.

20:04.704 --> 20:08.472
And Randy.
Oh...

20:08.474 --> 20:11.008
I'm gonna need
my duffle bag back.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.044
I hate to be an Uzbeki-giver,

20:13.046 --> 20:17.248
but I really miss
my vibrating pearl.

20:18.617 --> 20:21.652
Are these supposed to be
doing other things?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.322
Oh, no, does this mean
you want your swords back?

20:24.324 --> 20:27.091
'Cause I was gonna
butter some toast later.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.193
I'm sorry, Caroline.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.596
We really missed our sex toys.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.966
It's not as exciting when I just
put double-A batteries in Oleg.

20:37.669 --> 20:40.671
(sputtering)

20:42.007 --> 20:43.741
MAX: That's weird.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.344
Sophie's the one with sex toys,
I'm the one with the boyfriend,

20:46.346 --> 20:48.679
and Caroline's the one
who's wet.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.385
(cash register bell dings)
