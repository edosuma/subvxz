00:10.811 --> 00:15.015
JEFF: "Survivor" is back.

00:20.821 --> 00:25.559
18 strangers are about to begin
an adventure that will forever

00:25.593 --> 00:27.795
change their lives.

00:27.828 --> 00:32.066
They'll be abandoned and forced
to work together while voting

00:32.100 --> 00:36.170
each other out in the greatest
social experiment on television.

00:36.204 --> 00:41.809
In the end, only one will remain
to claim the $1 million prize.

00:41.842 --> 00:50.751
39 days, 18 people, 1 survivor!

01:14.308 --> 01:18.346
JEFF: Welcome to the
35th season of "survivor."

01:18.379 --> 01:25.353
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
For the first time you've been

01:25.386 --> 01:28.889
divided into three tribes based
on the positive traits most

01:28.922 --> 01:32.860
associated with you by others.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.229
This is how the world sees you.

01:35.263 --> 01:40.234
First group, you are the hero
tribe.

01:40.268 --> 01:40.901
[APPLAUSE]
I'll take that.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.069
I'll take that.

01:42.102 --> 01:46.240
JEFF: You are heralded for
your courage, your achieve.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.509
S, for your ideals for which you
stand.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.244
Guy in the cowboy hat, what's
your name?

01:50.278 --> 01:51.044
Ben.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.913
JEFF: Does this ring true
to you?

01:52.946 --> 01:53.881
What is your world about?

01:53.914 --> 01:56.650
Well, I have a family, a wife
and two kids.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.620
I was in the marine corps and
served our country.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.224
JEFF: So being in the armed
services, you have to have heard

02:03.257 --> 02:05.559
the word hero associated with
you.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.794
Some people might say that.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.598
To us it's just us doing our job
and fighting for our country.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.633
We'll go out and lay our lives
on the line.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.370
JEFF: What else would we
expect from someone else that

02:16.404 --> 02:18.806
serves our country than to say,
"it's just our job."

02:18.839 --> 02:20.674
That's all it is, Jeff.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.644
I definitely think I belong
on the hero tribe.

02:23.677 --> 02:27.181
I feel proud of having had a
career and then stopped and

02:27.215 --> 02:30.251
stayed home to take care of my
kids and then came back to an

02:30.284 --> 02:33.287
awesome career, but I need the
really downplay that because I

02:33.321 --> 02:36.390
don't want people to think, she
already makes a lot of money, so

02:36.424 --> 02:38.792
we don't want her to win a lot
of money.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.593
JEFF: Okay.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.430
Next group, you are the healer
tribe.

02:42.463 --> 02:48.936
You receive gratitude for your
acts of service helping others

02:48.969 --> 02:52.206
relieve their physical pain or
emotional pain.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.275
Guy in the middle, what's your
name?

02:54.308 --> 02:54.842
Cole.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.444
JEFF: What do you do?

02:56.477 --> 02:59.913
We take teens into the
outdoors and teach them lessons

02:59.947 --> 03:01.749
like making fire and survival
skills.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.484
The outdoors opened up my world.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.455
I want to open up other people's
worlds with the same thing that

03:07.488 --> 03:08.656
made mine so amazing.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.392
JEFF: Guy here in the front
with the glasses, what's your

03:11.425 --> 03:11.692
name?

03:11.725 --> 03:12.260
Mike.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.494
JEFF: What do you do?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.329
I'm a sex doctor.

03:15.363 --> 03:20.468
I'm a urologist and I specialize
in sexual dysfunction and male

03:20.501 --> 03:21.702
infertility.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.471
JEFF: You receive a lot of
gratitude from guys all the time

03:23.504 --> 03:25.239
in
Most guys are pretty happy

03:25.273 --> 03:26.740
when they're through with me.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.710
Winning "survivor" is the
biggest dream in my life.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.647
My wife thinks I'm crazy for
doing this, my kids think I'm

03:33.681 --> 03:36.484
going to die, but I'm going to
rise to the occasion and win.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.217
JEFF: All right.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.652
That brings us to our last
group.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.488
You are the hustler tribe.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.524
You are respected for your hard
work ethic.

03:43.557 --> 03:48.896
Your mantra is get it done no
matter what, 100% all the time.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.598
Woman in the middle, what's your
name?

03:50.631 --> 03:51.799
Ali.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.966
JEFF: What do you do?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.768
I'm a personal assistant.

03:54.802 --> 04:00.308
I work for someone at YouTube,
daily disk duties.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.411
Sometimes I do her make-up if
she doesn't have make-up artist.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.514
I cook for her if she doesn't
have a cook.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.781
I fill in the gaps.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.751
I wake up that day and find out
what I have to do, and I do it.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.488
DREW: Being part of a group
that's respected for work ethics

04:14.522 --> 04:15.323
rings very true to you?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.490
Oh, yeah.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.858
Just looking at our tribe, I
think it's a strong group.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.029
I hope they're macho enough and
they know how the build a

04:22.062 --> 04:23.431
shelter and crack a conut.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.533
I'm going to defer to them.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.000
I'm 125 pounds soaking wet.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.036
I don't drink and I don't have a
girlfriend.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.604
Who wants to align with me?

04:30.638 --> 04:31.204
JEFF: All right.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.473
We have three good groups.

04:32.506 --> 04:38.412
THIS SEASON IS CALLED "SURVIVOR:
Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers."

04:38.446 --> 04:42.550
Let me give you your buffs.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.952
It's like Christmas.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.954
Blue.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.458
JEFF: This is your first
opportunity to prove your value

04:50.491 --> 04:53.394
to your tribe.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.663
This boat is loaded with
supplies.

04:55.696 --> 04:59.667
Your job is to get as many of
the supplies from this boat to

04:59.700 --> 05:02.470
your boat.

05:02.503 --> 05:07.074
In addition, there's an even
bigger reward at stake.

05:07.107 --> 05:13.447
On the beach, each tribe has a
burning urn 15 feet high.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.451
When you hear mehring this bell,
that's your cue to get all six

05:17.485 --> 05:19.953
tribe members on the boat and
start paddling to shore.

05:19.987 --> 05:24.124
When you get to shore, you must
lift one person high enough to

05:24.157 --> 05:25.726
light their torch.

05:25.759 --> 05:31.465
First tribe to get fire wins
fire in the form of a massive

05:31.499 --> 05:35.569
fire-making kit that will be
waiting for you back at camp.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.871
[APPLAUSE]
Second tribe to finish, not as

05:37.905 --> 05:39.640
pretty but gets the job done,
flint.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.774
With this you can make fire.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.944
The last tribe to finish,
otherwise known as the losers,

05:43.977 --> 05:46.046
will go back to camp with no
fire.

05:46.079 --> 05:52.886
This is day one of a 39-day, $1
million adventure, and it begins

05:52.920 --> 05:53.821
now.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.588
"Survivor" is on.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.255
Let's go!

05:55.288 --> 05:56.757
Who can swim, who can swim?

05:56.790 --> 05:57.591
I can.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.859
Let's do this!

05:58.892 --> 06:01.895
>>
JEFF: This is it.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.165
This is the moment you've been
waiting for, and it's happening

06:05.198 --> 06:05.433
right now.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.166
Go!

06:06.199 --> 06:08.502
Go, go, go.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.637
Oh, my god.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.906
JEFF: Out of the gate it is
chaos.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.477
People already going overboard
with lots of supplies left on

06:16.510 --> 06:18.078
the boat.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.914
So far there is no plan at all.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.683
Let's go, guys.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.119
JEFF: Wow, people launching
stuff, Patrick launching fruit

06:26.153 --> 06:27.755
like a quarterback with no
receiver.

06:27.788 --> 06:28.922
Let's go, let's go.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.190
JEFF: 30 seconds.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.560
Remember, when I hit that bell,
you can head out.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.494
Let's go, guys.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.129
I see something labeled
secret advantage.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.765
I am super excited.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.932
My hands are trembling.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.569
I was like, whoo.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.936
JEFF: Lots of fruit in the
water.

06:42.970 --> 06:46.874
Now it becomes getting it to
your boat.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.976
A little bit more.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.744
JEFF: Everybody over.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.780
You have to get out of here now.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.213
Let's go, dude.

06:53.246 --> 06:53.947
Get over!

06:53.981 --> 06:55.949
That means now.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.085
Get in your boat and start
heading to the beach.

06:58.118 --> 07:01.021
Get in, get in.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.090
JEFF: Now it's first to get
fire.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.158
Let's hit it.

07:05.192 --> 07:09.663
Go!

07:09.697 --> 07:12.666
JEFF: The hustler tribe is
struggling to even get in their

07:12.700 --> 07:15.002
boat.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.805
Healers really working together
well.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.641
Heroes right on their tail.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.010
And the hustler tribe pointing
the wrong way.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.177
They're heading to a different
beach.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.979
Which way are we going, guys?

07:26.013 --> 07:28.115
Spin it right.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.883
Let's go, let's go.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.852
JEFF: Healers going to get
to the beach first.

07:31.885 --> 07:38.025
Then the heroes with the
hustlers literally lost at sea.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.127
Come on, come on.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.261
Someone jump out and help me.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.996
JEFF: Healers get here
first.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.498
You got to hook that boat.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.265
Here comes the hero tribe.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.800
Let's go, guys.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.668
Come on.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.936
DREW: We are neck and neck
right now.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.937
Both tribes very even.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.538
You're good.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.105
Start untying your torch.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.808
You're good, hero tribe.

07:54.842 --> 07:55.943
Start untying your torch.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.877
Come on.

07:56.910 --> 07:57.745
JEFF: Okay.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.280
Paul has the torch for the
healer tribe.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.882
You're the lightest.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.215
You're the lightest.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.350
No way.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.286
JEFF: You got to get
somebody high enough to get that

08:06.319 --> 08:07.187
fire.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.022
You hold the torch, you hold
the torch.

08:09.056 --> 08:13.160
JEFF: This is going to come
down to a very close finish.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.294
Healers there.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.797
Healers close.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.197
Yes!

08:17.230 --> 08:19.767
You got it.

08:19.800 --> 08:24.271
Healers get fire fire in a
massive fire reward.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.438
Heroes have it.

08:25.472 --> 08:30.310
It is healers and heroes with
the hustlers still trying to

08:30.343 --> 08:36.750
figure out what show they're on.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.851
All right.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.888
Healer tribe, you will have
waiting for you at camp a

08:40.921 --> 08:43.791
massive fire-making kit, and you
will know you're at your beach

08:43.823 --> 08:45.826
when you see the fire already
burning.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.862
Nice job.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.198
[APPLAUSE]
Hero tribe, flint, you can make

08:51.231 --> 08:56.203
fire with this.

08:56.236 --> 08:56.970
All right.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.240
Each tribe has a map in your
boat.

09:00.273 --> 09:05.779
Get in your boat, start paddling
and good luck.

09:05.813 --> 09:09.349
Coming from that horrible
competition, I was just pretty

09:09.382 --> 09:10.584
pissed.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.353
I'm hoping that our work ethic
and our strength alone can push

09:13.386 --> 09:16.824
us to come together and get it
done, but at this point I'm very

09:16.857 --> 09:21.061
nervous.

09:40.013 --> 09:44.685
As we row in, we see the
biggest fire any of us have ever

09:44.718 --> 09:46.954
seen.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.222
And it sets us off on the right
foot.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.357
I'm so proud of us.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.224
I know.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.425
Way to go, team.

09:52.459 --> 09:57.130
Healers are definitely a
team-based group in terms of how

09:57.164 --> 10:00.133
we approach our careers, in
terms of how we approach our

10:00.167 --> 10:02.736
lives, and I think that's a
really distinct difference

10:02.770 --> 10:05.673
between us and the other two.

10:05.706 --> 10:11.011
I'm literally with the three
females.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.146
There's a group strength, right?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.182
And you, you got the eight pack.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.718
Cole is Tarzan, I like him a
lot.

10:17.751 --> 10:18.719
He's fun.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.354
He's trying not to be the tough
guy, but he is.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.157
I mean, he's ripped.

10:24.191 --> 10:28.161
He has beautiful, tan skin,
blonde hair, blue eyes.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.329
I think I'm in love.

10:29.362 --> 10:35.168
I'm so glad we have this
tribe.

10:35.202 --> 10:39.172
Even if we have an off day,
we're still safe.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.373
I just don't see it.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.043
It's all about communication.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.011
It's about communication.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.079
That's what we do for a living.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.280
Yeah.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.449
I wanted to be in the tribe
they could easily manipulate,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.385
and I feel that when you're a
healer, you have a big heart,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.922
and when you have a big heart,
you don't think with your mind,

10:54.955 --> 10:56.189
you think with your heart.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.859
I'm a healer in the fact that my
main job is rehabilitation, but

10:58.892 --> 11:02.429
I'm not a from base officer when
I'm out here.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.496
I came out here to win.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.366
I'm probably more strategic than
everyone altogether.

11:06.399 --> 11:17.077
So they're all my victims at
this point.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.445
Whew.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.715
Big piece on the bottom,
little piece on top.

11:21.749 --> 11:22.482
Let's go.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.483
Yeah?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.719
Now we're happening.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.021
Need help with that?

11:28.055 --> 11:31.358
The qualities of being a hero
are going to help in "survivor,"

11:31.391 --> 11:34.027
because the whole idea of being
a hero, you're putting others

11:34.061 --> 11:36.764
before yourself, which makes for
a really strong tribe.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.998
What about firewood?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.466
But game on.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.303
The hero cape falls off and
automatically you're thinking

11:43.336 --> 11:45.005
alliances, conversations need to
happen.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.508
So it will definitely start to
get interesting.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.910
What are you thinking?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.445
I like cowboy.

11:52.479 --> 11:52.913
What's up?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.314
I like cowboy?

11:54.347 --> 11:58.518
Yeah, me, you, cowboy?

11:58.551 --> 11:59.753
That's pretty good?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.789
He's smart and useful.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
I think we can make that
work.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.760
I played in the n.F.L. For
nine years, and after you play

12:06.794 --> 12:09.396
for a while, you can see who is
a tempo setter.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.165
Just now, I got a sense of how
people are playing the game.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.134
We're going to need a lot
more.

12:14.167 --> 12:18.405
I'm definitely going to play
the game, which for me is full

12:18.438 --> 12:19.907
tilt sprint out the gate.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.541
Who are you thinking of working
with?

12:21.574 --> 12:22.309
We need to win challenges.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.043
We need strength.

12:23.076 --> 12:23.944
Absolutely.

12:23.977 --> 12:24.477
We have to win.

12:24.511 --> 12:30.317
We need strength.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.184
J.T. Is an asset.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.988
You and Ashley, that's four
right there.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.389
We're going to explode on that.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.424
Okay.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.459
I work with so many
firefighters and soon-to-be

12:39.492 --> 12:40.293
firefighters.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.229
You remind me so much of all of
them.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.997
Oh, yeah?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.433
They must be pretty cool
guys.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.367
They're all my best friends.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.937
I've been watching those two
for a while.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.973
I honestly think Ashley and
j.P.M. Are working together, so

12:53.006 --> 12:56.243
I want the make them believe
I'll work with them, but this

12:56.276 --> 13:00.147
power couple or whatever they
got going on is over.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.849
They're going to go get
water.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.016
Nice.

13:03.050 --> 13:06.519
Hey, y'all, four, right?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.355
Yeah.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.189
Yeah.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.457
I wanted us four from the
beginning.

13:10.490 --> 13:15.896
Right now we're looking at a
core four, and that's me, Alan,

13:15.929 --> 13:17.564
Ashley, and j.P.

13:17.597 --> 13:21.969
We're all younger, we're fit,
and then we got the two moms,

13:22.002 --> 13:23.003
Chrissy and Katrina.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.037
The whole young crowd.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.105
It is.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.007
If you and I don't work
together at some level...

13:27.040 --> 13:28.876
No, no, we have to.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.610
We've labeled them the mom
squad.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.079
That's an easy target at this
point.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.514
Keep it strong.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.215
That's it.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.449
We're done.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.551
Winning is the most important
thing right now for this tribe.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.253
We're going to be fine.

13:40.287 --> 13:53.533
When it comes down to it, we
have each other's backs.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.102
Can I make a suggestion?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.336
Yeah.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.438
We need to be over here, away
from this over here, because,

13:58.471 --> 14:03.443
you know, there's critters and
spiders and snakes.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.913
I'm just disappointed we didn't
win the challenge, but at the

14:05.946 --> 14:08.982
same time, let's not give up.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.184
Get it in there, baby.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.554
Being hustler, we're hard
workers, so we kind of kick it

14:14.587 --> 14:15.522
in gear.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.589
I like it.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.659
This is what we need to do
the rest of this game.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.561
Really if we play as a team,
we'll be fine.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.197
If not we're going to be
screwed.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.298
That's a walking stick.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.399
Should I eat it?

14:26.433 --> 14:26.934
No.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.101
You don't think so?

14:28.135 --> 14:29.369
No.

14:29.402 --> 14:34.407
My priorities for day one are
to make sure that I connect with

14:34.441 --> 14:37.310
people, and Patrick seems like
he's meshing well with the group

14:37.344 --> 14:40.347
just from the very beginning, so
I kind of want the see where his

14:40.380 --> 14:44.684
head is at.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.387
I forgot I have a crab in my
pants.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.623
I know if we never lose, we
don't have to worry about an

14:50.657 --> 14:52.960
alliance, but the way we looked
in the first challenge, we

14:52.993 --> 14:56.096
should probably start talking
now.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.264
How do you feel about it?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.199
I feel we have a good team.

14:59.232 --> 15:04.371
We've got to win first tribal,
though.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.638
Definitely want to make a game
plan.

15:05.672 --> 15:10.010
You at least have to have the
mind set, but I got your back if

15:10.043 --> 15:10.510
you got mine.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.146
I got your back.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.414
Ali, she's a very smart girl.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.151
On an island where we can trust
no one, I feel I can trust her,

15:18.185 --> 15:21.721
but it's "survivor," so you
can't know for sure.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.656
I feel good, but I'm not
certain.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.126
Now I'm wondering who got the
clue on the boat.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.460
You think someone found
something?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.696
If not, somebody overlooked
it.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.497
It was on there.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.132
I found an advantage on the
boat.

15:32.165 --> 15:32.966
Nobody knows about it.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.267
It's in my pants.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.269
I'm dying to know what it is.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.273
For the first time someone is
dying to get in my pants.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.043
I kind of just wait for the
perfect moment to get away.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.611
I go into the jungle by myself.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.079
I am super excited.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.281
I have never had an advantage in
my entire life.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.349
I'm a hustler.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.652
Hustlers don't get advantages,
and the hustler got an

15:52.685 --> 15:53.520
advantage.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.488
You have found an immunity
superidol.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.425
It can be played after the votes
have been read and will save

15:58.458 --> 16:00.393
whoever you play it for.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.261
Oh, my god.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.762
This could be my power to win
this game.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.165
I have a super immunity idol.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.368
That could be used after the
votes have been read.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.238
That gives you so much power.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.172
A twist.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.340
It's only good at the first
tribal council.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.443
If your tribe wins immunity,
that means you will not go to

16:16.476 --> 16:18.078
the first tribal council.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.181
You must send somebody to the
losing tribe.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.715
The recipient will not know who
sent it.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.186
If we pull out a win, I have
to give it to a member of the

16:26.219 --> 16:28.055
losing tribe that goes to
tribal.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.424
That means that I have the most
power right now in this game,

16:31.458 --> 16:32.459
and nobody else has any clue
whatsoever.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.441
Okay.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.642
I'm ready for marching orders.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.344
Lest gather some more bamboo
so we have everything here.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.445
That sounds good.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.281
The shelter will go over here I
think.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.417
I'm fortunate to be part of
the healer tribe.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.685
We're in high spirits.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.354
We know that first and foremost
we can communicate, and as long

17:01.388 --> 17:06.726
as we do that in camp life,
everything runs smoothly.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.194
Holy crap, nice.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.061
I know.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.598
My son told me to look for
the idol.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.334
He's ten years old, and he
watches survivor.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.338
If my ten-year-old son knows to
look for the idol, I should go

17:18.371 --> 17:20.073
looking for it, and so should
everybody else.

17:20.107 --> 17:25.612
I think the only concern is
being this close to mosquitoes.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.079
Should we check the fire?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.315
I'll go check it.

17:28.348 --> 17:32.519
My biggest fear going into thi
game is being voted out first.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
I left my kids and my wife
behind to play this crazy game,

17:35.588 --> 17:38.258
but I did not come out here for
an adventure.

17:38.291 --> 17:42.562
I am out here to win $1 million
and be the best "survivor"

17:42.595 --> 17:43.663
player ever.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.799
So I am willing to do what it
takes to win this game.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.536
Nice.

17:49.569 --> 17:53.240
When Mike comes back, I'm
going to ask him to draw us map

17:53.273 --> 17:56.209
of the island, because he knows
it like the back of his hand,

17:56.243 --> 17:56.776
like legit.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.044
He knows everything.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.248
Mike is definitely a player,
and I'm a tad bit concerned that

18:01.281 --> 18:02.882
he's running around trying to
find the idol.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.885
So I think he wanted to look for
the idol.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.755
Now he's probably going to be no
m.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.457
He's getting firewood.

18:10.490 --> 18:14.794
I have a great lie detector,
and I'm thinking Mike is not a

18:14.827 --> 18:19.666
trustworthy guy.

18:19.699 --> 18:24.204
We undid the bad with the
bandannas on the other side,

18:24.237 --> 18:25.138
too.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.707
Mike's suspect running around
this island.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.677
I personally think he has the
idol.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.545
I wish I did, that would be
awesome.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.814
So you looked through this
whole island and you didn't find

18:34.847 --> 18:35.848
nothing?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.685
I haven't looked through the
whole island yet.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.287
We both watch the game.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.689
I'm honored that you think
I'm a hustler.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.926
No, no, no, the thing is I
respect you enough to come see

18:46.959 --> 18:48.261
you individually right or wrong.

18:48.295 --> 18:48.728
That's nice.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.297
I respect that.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.700
Hopefully you respect me, as
well, that's all I'm saying.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.568
I do respect you.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.705
I don't trust Joe for one
second.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.642
He's pulled me aside to have a
man-to-man talk with me to

19:02.675 --> 19:07.814
essentially bully me into
telling him that I went looking

19:07.847 --> 19:08.848
for the immunity idol.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.818
I wanted you to be aware that
we are all aware.

19:11.851 --> 19:12.752
That's what I'm saying.

19:12.785 --> 19:16.456
But at the same time it puts
me at risk.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.925
Perception is 90% of reality,
unfortunately.

19:18.958 --> 19:27.667
And with that you don't want to
be having to fight perceptions.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.769
Oh, my god.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.538
This is so light right now.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.840
I don't know who got all the
weight, but it's not me.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.208
I feel like it's me.

19:35.242 --> 19:39.612
Three, two, one, drop... good
work.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.882
These first impressions are
crucial, and I really like

19:42.915 --> 19:44.851
having Devon in this group
because he's different than me.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.554
Devon, what do you do again?

19:47.587 --> 19:52.392
Teach kids how to surf.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.561
I don't make a lot, but it pays
my rent.

19:54.594 --> 19:58.531
He seems like a guy who is
looking for someone who is more

19:58.565 --> 19:59.766
strategically sound.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.668
So I'm waiting for the perfect
moment when everybody is cleared

20:01.701 --> 20:04.437
out of camp so I can build a
connection.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.672
So I found an advantage
yesterday.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.473
You did?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.475
On the boat, yeah.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.576
Only for the first tribal.

20:09.609 --> 20:13.913
I have the idol that could be
played after the votes.

20:13.946 --> 20:14.314
Yeah.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.582
And that's it.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.851
And if we don't go to tribal, I
have to give it to somebody else

20:18.885 --> 20:19.151
on their tribe.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.687
Okay.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.954
I'm so happy, dude.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.525
Dude, I was so scared to be
first one.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.926
You're not going to be first
one.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.094
No, no.

20:28.127 --> 20:32.265
Ryan tells me about this
special immunity idol and said

20:32.299 --> 20:34.401
he will be willing to use the
idol for me.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.737
Ryan and I have the same
mindset, same ideas, our

20:37.770 --> 20:38.538
chemistry is perfect.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.972
We're going to cause chaos
together.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.041
I haven't told anyone else
and I'm not.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.545
Keep it, keep it.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.879
That's how much I trust you.

20:46.913 --> 21:00.727
Cool.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.429
She was about to hit me.

21:02.462 --> 21:02.929
Did you see that?

21:02.962 --> 21:03.796
I did.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.299
If you were closer I would have
hit you

21:06.333 --> 21:07.734
you were just too far away.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.935
It's not first time?

21:08.968 --> 21:13.706
First time what, for us to
fight?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.376
I know there's something
going on between j.P. And

21:16.409 --> 21:17.444
Ashley.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.312
It's red flags all over the
place between those two.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.582
I need to let everybody know
those two are stronger together

21:22.615 --> 21:25.985
right now than question are all
as individuals.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.688
Yo, you got the idol.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.689
It's cool if he got it.

21:29.722 --> 21:33.626
I don't have the idol, 100%.

21:33.660 --> 21:39.466
How far are you willing to go
to move... to prove that?

21:39.499 --> 21:40.299
Let's go to the swim.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.903
Let's go to the water's edge
right now.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.638
I swear on my mom's grave.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.407
I don't want to do that.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.108
Man's handshake.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.443
I don't need that.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.844
Just put your hands up.

21:51.878 --> 21:52.679
I swear the god.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.981
I know where the idol is
right now.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.816
I know where it's at right now.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.351
I just kind of know what's going
on.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.752
Trust me, I promise.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.822
What did you just say, I know
what's going on?

22:02.855 --> 22:04.090
Are we four strong or not?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.825
I thought so.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.495
You are tripping like you're
tripping, tripping.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.897
I don't know if they have an
idol.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.131
I didn't actually see anything.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.265
I just threw it out there.

22:13.299 --> 22:17.103
I know I look like the crazy
man, but now I got suspicion

22:17.136 --> 22:20.640
going, and I just put target on
their back if it worked the way

22:20.673 --> 22:21.808
it's supposed to work.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.943
You're insinuating that
there's something going on that

22:23.976 --> 22:26.513
you don't know about, and
there's not.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.815
Nothing going on that I don't
know about?

22:28.848 --> 22:29.315
No.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.517
Will is no idol?

22:30.550 --> 22:31.751
There is no idol.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.920
Alan is a crazy man.

22:33.953 --> 22:37.624
He gets this crazy look in his
eye and it's his drama and

22:37.657 --> 22:41.461
everything he causes is I think
maybe not worth his strength.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.930
Just a loose cannon like that
rocks the ship.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.698
Are we four strong?

22:45.732 --> 22:46.566
Yes.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.800
Dude, you're tripping hard
right now.

22:47.834 --> 22:51.103
I know, I know, because it
looks like I'm tripping, right?

22:51.137 --> 22:52.104
Yeah.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.141
So the idol in your pants I'm
tripping about?

22:55.174 --> 22:57.877
If he has an idol, I know
nothing about it.

22:57.910 --> 23:03.115
Don't turn around, why are
you turning around?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.985
I know you got the idol, my man?

23:06.018 --> 23:06.819
Where is it at?

23:06.853 --> 23:10.156
Alan is starting to lose his
mind.

23:10.189 --> 23:14.827
He made j.P. Strip to check his
pants for an idol, so my mind is

23:14.861 --> 23:16.028
literally blown right now.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.998
His paranoia is so bad, like
where is this coming from all of

23:19.031 --> 23:22.935
a sudden, because I trusted him
and I thought he trusted me, but

23:22.969 --> 23:24.136
just like that, trust is
tournament window.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.873
So moving forward with him seems
like it could be a liability

23:26.906 --> 23:27.907
down the road.

23:45.224 --> 23:57.737
JEFF: Come on in, guys.

23:57.770 --> 23:58.871
All right.

23:58.905 --> 24:04.210
You guys ready to get to your
first immunity challenge?

24:04.243 --> 24:05.277
[APPLAUSE]
Yeah.

24:05.311 --> 24:07.079
JEFF: For today's
challenge, you're going the race

24:07.113 --> 24:10.216
up a cargo net to the top of a
tower.

24:10.249 --> 24:16.022
You'll then pull a heavy cart
up, hop in, and careen down to

24:16.055 --> 24:21.227
the bottom where you will find a
choice of three "survivor" table

24:21.260 --> 24:22.094
mazes.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.262
The first tribe here gets first
choice.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.999
Second tribe to arrive gets to
choose between the remaining

24:27.033 --> 24:27.700
two.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.936
The last tribe gets what's left.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.806
You'll then work together to get
that maze to the top of an even

24:33.840 --> 24:37.076
taller tower, where two players
will maneuver three balls

24:37.109 --> 24:38.811
through the maze.

24:38.845 --> 24:43.783
First two tribes to finish win
immunity.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.854
These are the immunity idols.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.021
This is what you want.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.824
With one of these in your
possession, you are safe in this

24:51.858 --> 24:54.994
game.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.564
Losers, tribal council where
somebody will be the first

24:57.597 --> 24:58.765
person voted out.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.200
In addition, hustlers, you are
still playing for fire in the

25:01.233 --> 25:02.334
form of flint.

25:02.368 --> 25:07.006
One more thing, at tribal
council this season, tie votes

25:07.039 --> 25:08.007
are back in.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.676
Give you a minute to strategize.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.577
We'll get started.

25:10.610 --> 25:15.948
Let's do it.

25:15.982 --> 25:16.549
All right.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.584
Here we go.

25:17.617 --> 25:21.621
For immunity, survivors ready?

25:21.654 --> 25:23.623
Go!

25:23.656 --> 25:26.025
You got to get up that cargo
net.

25:26.058 --> 25:33.766
Attack it.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.638
Heroes first on their part, then
the healers, then the hustlers.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.972
Those carts are heavy.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.241
This is where adrenaline is your
friend.

25:42.274 --> 25:46.746
It gives you strength you didn't
know you had.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.949
Healers get to the top first,
then the heroes, then the

25:49.982 --> 25:50.583
hustlers.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.653
Once you're in, release it.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.787
Go, go.

25:54.821 --> 25:57.757
JEFF: Hustlers get out
first, then the hero, then the

25:57.790 --> 26:01.127
healers.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.128
That is how you do it.

26:02.161 --> 26:06.232
Come on, come on, everybody.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.700
JEFF: Heroes here first.

26:07.734 --> 26:10.302
You have first choice.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.337
What do you want?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.271
They choose three.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.940
Hustlers have a choice between
the remaining.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.908
Two they choose one.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.945
Healers left with number two.

26:18.978 --> 26:22.214
Next phase is getting to the top
now.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.315
Heroes out of the gate first.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.350
You got it.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.886
JEFF: Now you got to get
two people to the top.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.188
Go up top.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.991
JEFF: Alan going up, Ashley
going up for the heroes.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.826
It is Cole and Joe for the
healers.

26:33.860 --> 26:38.397
It is Lauren and Ryan, a
surprising choice to be pulling

26:38.430 --> 26:41.367
for the hustlers.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.102
This sled is heavy.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.038
It's going to take a lot of
teamwork.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.741
Joe taking a long time to even
get to the top.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.844
They can't start pulling until
he gets there.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.713
Three, two, one!

26:53.746 --> 26:54.981
Three, two, one!

26:55.014 --> 26:56.382
Three, two, one!

26:56.415 --> 26:59.385
JEFF: Cole and Joe going to
pull for the healers.

26:59.418 --> 27:00.720
Watch out.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.754
Watch your leg.

27:01.788 --> 27:05.257
JEFF: The healers working
to make up some time.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.126
Guide us in, guide us in.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.395
JEFF: Hustlers get up
first.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.863
Heros have theirs.

27:10.897 --> 27:11.964
Healers now have theirs.

27:11.998 --> 27:15.802
You got to lock in your handles
now.

27:15.835 --> 27:21.941
It is Chrissy and Ben for the
heroes in a traditional phase,

27:21.974 --> 27:28.948
Devon and Ali for the hustlers
on the obstacle maze.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.416
Mike and Desi for the healers.

27:30.449 --> 27:34.353
This is where adrenaline works
against you because you brain is

27:34.386 --> 27:36.355
playing, please slow down so I
can think.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.158
There is definitely a learning
curve, like most "survivor"

27:39.191 --> 27:39.792
challenges.

27:39.826 --> 27:40.592
You've got to figure it out.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.395
When there is a bar on the
right.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.397
Lean a little right.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.032
Good.

27:46.065 --> 27:46.632
That's it.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.901
Now lean a little left.

27:48.935 --> 27:49.668
Yes, yes!

27:49.702 --> 27:52.371
JEFF: Healers with a nice
touch.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.139
And they have it.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.741
The healers have their first
ball.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.108
Great job, you guys.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.209
You have this now.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.212
JEFF: Now the heroes and
hustlers are feeling that

28:00.246 --> 28:00.780
pressure.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.414
Nice move by the heroes.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.050
They're figuring it out.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.053
Hustlers getting close.

28:07.086 --> 28:07.920
Yes!

28:07.954 --> 28:09.121
JEFF: Hustlers have their
first point.

28:09.155 --> 28:14.861
It is now healers with one,
hustlers with one, heroes yet to

28:14.894 --> 28:15.862
get on the board.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.463
Heros have their first ball.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.831
Moving on to their second.

28:18.865 --> 28:23.269
We are tied now 1-1.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.971
Healers are through.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.907
They're close to their second if
they can save it.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.443
They have the second ball for
the healers.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.981
Hustlers very close to landing
their second ball.

28:35.014 --> 28:38.517
Heroes are once again very
close.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.988
Heroes in and out.

28:42.021 --> 28:42.855
Heroes have their second.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.057
And the hustlers drop right
behind them.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.359
It is 2-2-2.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.494
Healers very close.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.496
Steady, Mike.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.066
JEFF: Dr. Mike and Desi
trying to'd that in for the win.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.803
Healers win first immunity.

28:56.836 --> 28:59.505
They are safe from tribal
council.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.440
Jeff, Jeff.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.010
JEFF: We're looking for one
more.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.411
Slow, slow.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.980
JEFF: Hustlers are around
their difficult spot.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.482
They are very close to closing
this out.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.920
This is the big move right here
for the hero tribe.

29:13.953 --> 29:17.523
Toughest spot on their maze.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.525
Chrissy and Ben with a nation
move and they're through.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.527
Too far back, too far back.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.262
JEFF: There is a showdown.

29:23.295 --> 29:27.934
Who can get that third ball to
drop first?

29:27.967 --> 29:30.302
Heros in and out.

29:30.336 --> 29:32.905
Slow.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.808
JEFF: Both tribes
maneuvering that ball to get it

29:35.842 --> 29:41.948
to drop.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.884
Hustlers win immunity, sending
the hero tribe to tribal

29:44.917 --> 29:46.252
council.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.120
Good job.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.288
We have to work together.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.458
Oh, my god, yes!

29:52.491 --> 29:58.530
Oh, my god.

29:58.564 --> 30:02.368
JEFF: Healer tribe,
congratulations.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.303
Impressive start, two wins in a
row.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.539
Nobody going home from your
tribe.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.142
Hustlers, nobody going home from
your tribe, as well.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.912
In addition, fire in the form of
flint.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.113
Good luck with that.

30:14.146 --> 30:18.584
Thanks, Jeff.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.120
JEFF: Chrissy, are you all
right?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.221
Chrissy, do you need a hand?

30:22.254 --> 30:25.057
Do you want medical or do you
want your tribe to help?

30:25.091 --> 30:31.497
I just...

30:31.530 --> 30:32.331
JEFF: That's it.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.265
Let it out.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.936
We have medical here if you need
it, Chrissy.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.171
You'll be all right.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.407
You can't say that we didn't
give our all.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.642
We did our best.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.345
We're going the make lemonade
out of lemons.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.915
JEFF: This is what
"survivor" is all acted.

30:48.948 --> 30:52.251
You rely on each other, and the
complication is you have to get

30:52.284 --> 30:53.619
rid of each other.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.989
Somebody going home tonight,
first person voted out of

30:57.023 --> 30:57.489
"SURVIVOR: Heroes v. Healers v.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.290
Hustlers."

30:58.324 --> 30:58.891
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.126
See you tonight at tribal.

31:00.159 --> 31:00.993
Okay.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.628
I'm good.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.998
I found this super immunity
idol.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.500
It is only good for the first
tribal council.

31:08.534 --> 31:12.071
So I now have to give toilet a
member of that losing tribe.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.407
I can give this to someone who
is in the minority and save them

31:15.441 --> 31:18.477
tonight, and they can take out
someone who may be a threat and

31:18.510 --> 31:20.512
change the game.

31:43.702 --> 31:44.436
Before last night this vote
was easy.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.973
I love our tribe the way it
is.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.507
It's too bad it has to change,
huh?

31:48.540 --> 31:49.441
Yeah.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.542
This is not how it was
supposed to start.

31:50.576 --> 31:54.446
Alan created basically a
spectacle out of nothing.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.684
Go get some water?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.052
Go get firewood.

32:00.086 --> 32:00.652
Yeah.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.154
Do you want me to come?

32:02.188 --> 32:03.322
Yeah.

32:03.355 --> 32:07.159
In less than 12 hours,
everything went from 100% we're

32:07.193 --> 32:12.031
safe, solid four, to there
really is no trust.

32:12.064 --> 32:15.234
All right.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.169
Katrina, we all good?

32:17.203 --> 32:17.603
I'm good.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.705
For tonight?

32:19.738 --> 32:20.372
Ash?

32:20.406 --> 32:21.473
Easy, right?

32:21.507 --> 32:22.141
Yeah.

32:22.174 --> 32:22.641
You?

32:22.674 --> 32:24.043
I'm good.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.445
Let's keep it simple.

32:26.478 --> 32:30.549
Ashley and j.P. Think that
I'm still in the core four with

32:30.582 --> 32:33.152
them, but I don't trust Ashley
and j.P. Further than I can

32:33.185 --> 32:33.952
throw them.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.454
They might be like, Alan got to
go.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.556
So whatever they trying to do,
I'm blowing it up.

32:37.589 --> 32:41.227
What are you thinking?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.362
Ain't nobody been talking to
me about game?

32:43.395 --> 32:43.996
Nobody has.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.397
We got to work together.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.732
We still got only two votes.

32:46.765 --> 32:50.269
We could go with Chrissy and
Ben?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.638
Chrissy?

32:52.671 --> 32:55.607
Come here.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.243
What do you want to do?

32:57.276 --> 33:00.246
This is what I'm thinking?

33:00.279 --> 33:02.614
I nobody has talked game with
me.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.317
She's saying no one has talked
game with her either.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.585
So that's two.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.520
So you think it's you and you
think it's you, because I think

33:08.554 --> 33:08.920
it's me?

33:08.954 --> 33:10.556
Yeah, yeah.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.525
I do think the three of us plus
Ben can make a strong four.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.660
I don't feel safe.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.495
I don't have a good alliance on
the team.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.298
I knew I need to get people to
vote together.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.666
We need four people to vote for
somebody.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.302
We're have a quick powwow.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.570
We're trying to figure out a
plan.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.671
Ashley and j.F.K. Talk.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.239
They probably have a plan.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.641
If that was the case, who
right now?

33:29.675 --> 33:30.842
Ashley.

33:30.876 --> 33:35.247
Right now I think I have plan
with Chrissy, Alan, and Ben.

33:35.281 --> 33:38.817
I have to put faith in three
people I'm not sure totally have

33:38.850 --> 33:39.718
my back.

33:39.751 --> 33:43.555
Hopefully it works.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.391
I'm with you.

33:45.424 --> 33:46.258
It keeps us strong.

33:46.292 --> 33:51.397
I just know Ashley, she's a
wild card.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.532
We're still keeping our eyes
open.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.202
If everyone would have
stucked to the plan and calm

33:56.235 --> 33:58.170
down and talked it out, we'd be
fine.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.240
But here we are, day three, and
we've all just blown up.

34:01.273 --> 34:02.508
I feel good with the plan.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.243
Good plan.

34:04.276 --> 34:07.613
Yep.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.416
At tribal council tonight,
there's two ways Alan and I can

34:10.449 --> 34:11.650
go.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.485
We can go with the mom squad and
go straight for Ashley, or we

34:14.520 --> 34:20.759
can go with j.P. And Ashley and
get Chrissy or Katrina out.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.862
I'm a little worried about
Ashley and j.P. Having something

34:23.895 --> 34:28.567
going on, but as a tribe, we
have to stay strong, and the two

34:28.600 --> 34:32.103
older women are probably the
weakest links in our tribe.

34:32.138 --> 34:35.440
Whether or not you go with
strength or loyalty, in the long

34:35.474 --> 34:38.543
run it's about Alan and I, who
we trust most.

34:38.577 --> 34:45.684
We're getting low on time,
y'all.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.719
I was getting ready for
tribal.

34:47.753 --> 34:48.820
I looked in my bag.

34:48.853 --> 34:49.855
I see a package.

34:49.888 --> 35:00.332
I have no idea what it is.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.567
Oh, my gosh.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.736
Someone has secretly chosen you
to receive immense power early

35:04.770 --> 35:06.472
in the game.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.807
Oh, my gosh.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.343
This is an immunity super idol.

35:11.377 --> 35:14.746
This idol can be played after
the votes have been read, but it

35:14.780 --> 35:18.284
can only be used at tonight's
tribal council.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.151
Wow.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.220
How lucky did I get?

35:21.253 --> 35:25.624
I got the super immunity idol,
and it feels incredible.

35:25.657 --> 35:30.862
I think the decision of what I
do with this super idol is

35:30.896 --> 35:35.201
extremely important, especially
since half the tribe is

35:35.234 --> 35:37.703
potentially on the chopping
block, Katrina, me, Ashley,

35:37.736 --> 35:38.904
Alan, we don't know.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.640
Clearly if it's me on the block,
I'm using it to save myself.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.244
I just want to see what plays
out, and I'm going to let the

35:45.277 --> 35:47.846
discussion at tribal council
dictate whether I play it and

35:47.879 --> 35:49.881
for whom.

36:16.975 --> 36:17.809
JEFF: Behind each of you is
a torch.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.411
Go ahead and grab a torch.

36:19.445 --> 36:25.951
Dip it in and get fire.

36:25.984 --> 36:30.589
This is part of the ritual of
tribal council, because fire

36:30.622 --> 36:31.423
represents life.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.958
And when your fire is gone, so
are you.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.960
Sadly, that will be the case for
somebody.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.896
Ben, are you feeling, man, the
game really does move this fast?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.965
It's exciting.

36:39.998 --> 36:40.766
It's scary.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.834
JEFF: But?

36:42.868 --> 36:46.305
But that's the game we all
came to play.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.473
So...

36:47.506 --> 36:49.475
JEFF: Chrissy, what was the
vibe those first few moments

36:49.508 --> 36:50.676
when you hit the beach?

36:50.709 --> 36:54.546
Immediately I felt that I did
not belong with this group.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.781
JEFF: Really?

36:55.814 --> 36:58.750
Yeah, I honestly felt that
the four major physical threats

36:58.784 --> 37:00.986
would probably get together.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.354
JEFF: And who is that?

37:02.388 --> 37:05.824
Ashley, j.P., Alan, and Ben.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.627
JEFF: Katrina, did you have
the same feeling?

37:08.660 --> 37:12.264
Yeah, being older than a lot
of these other people here, they

37:12.298 --> 37:15.000
might look to us to be voted out
first service somebody else.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.903
JEFF: Ashley, one of the
unique things about this game is

37:17.936 --> 37:21.573
you find yourself with people
that you might not ever even

37:21.607 --> 37:22.741
meet otherwise.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.976
The people out here will tell
you exactly what they think,

37:25.010 --> 37:26.412
true or not, we never know.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.379
Right.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.515
There's a lot that you never
know in this game.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.882
You kind of figure that out.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.150
JEFF: How so?

37:32.183 --> 37:34.520
Day two and a half there was
already a little commotion going

37:34.553 --> 37:35.521
on.

37:35.554 --> 37:38.857
Alan pulls j.P. And me and says,
we have an idol.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.992
No clue where that came from.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.829
Either an idol or a clue.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.864
I'm not going to back down
from saying that.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.734
Jeff, we tried our best to
convince him that what he thinks

37:48.767 --> 37:50.636
he saw is not true.

37:50.669 --> 37:54.573
But that's not going to
change my mind, you deny, deny,

37:54.606 --> 37:55.607
deny, deny.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.810
He had j.P. Strip all his
clothes to check for a

37:58.844 --> 37:59.878
non-existent idol.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.614
JEFF: So j.P., you're
wrapped up in this, as well.

38:02.648 --> 38:03.849
I guess a little bit.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.016
JEFF: A little bit?

38:05.050 --> 38:08.019
You took your clothes off to
prove you don't have an idol.

38:08.053 --> 38:08.887
It's part of the game.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.756
Everybody is welcome to their
opinions.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.391
You can only do so much.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.527
JEFF: Chrissy, one thing
about survivor is the minute you

38:15.561 --> 38:18.897
get linked with somebody else,
now you're seen as two votes.

38:18.930 --> 38:19.931
Yeah.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.468
And that really is what happened
in this situation.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.471
People are concerned that we had
a power couple.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.940
To have the term power couple
even thrown around is ridiculous

38:28.974 --> 38:29.508
to me.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.676
There is no me and j.P.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.911
There has been no conversation
other than right in front of

38:32.944 --> 38:34.012
you.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.246
Think thing was to let the
tribe know that there's

38:35.280 --> 38:38.950
something stronger in the tribe
than the tribe, whether these

38:38.984 --> 38:41.620
folks believe what I believe, I
know what I know.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.389
I'm not crazy.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.155
I'm confident.

38:44.189 --> 38:45.223
You're going to feel very
silly.

38:45.256 --> 38:49.828
If I go home tonight because
I'm silly, so be it.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.631
But I don't think we need to
bicker and banter about.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.600
This we are labeled the heroes.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.403
We need to have the mentality
that we can do what we planned

38:57.436 --> 39:00.005
and make our team strong and
then we'll hash out whatever we

39:00.038 --> 39:02.441
need the hash out later.

39:02.474 --> 39:06.412
JEFF: Alan, that sounds
like Ben has another plan that

39:06.445 --> 39:07.746
he's trying to make sure that's
what's happening.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.880
Definitely.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.617
I could have afforded to sit
back with my feet up and be

39:11.650 --> 39:12.017
comfortable.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.151
I could have.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.455
Because everybody has had the
talk about getting rid of

39:16.488 --> 39:17.556
Katrina.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.591
Everybody is throwing out names
to get rid of Chrissy.

39:19.625 --> 39:22.794
But that's the risk I had to
take to let people know exactly

39:22.828 --> 39:23.929
what's going on.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.632
JEFF: Chrissy, Alan said,
I'll tell you what the early

39:26.665 --> 39:27.866
talk was, the two older women.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.169
That feels terrible, of
course.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.738
I think that would be unwise.

39:32.771 --> 39:35.607
I think that voting me off is
losing my skills.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.644
Jeff, I think there's a point
where everybody is at the

39:38.677 --> 39:41.613
chopping block at some point and
we have to do what we can do to

39:41.647 --> 39:44.082
connect with people, because if
we can all stay more honest

39:44.115 --> 39:47.719
about what's really happening,
we'll get further in the tribe

39:47.753 --> 39:49.120
than pretending these things
don't exist.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.890
Jeff, I have no clue what's
going to happen tonight.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.460
We had a plan, but it's up in
the air.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.662
We're going to have to do some
damage control one way or the

39:56.695 --> 39:57.696
other.

39:57.729 --> 40:02.501
Period.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.001
JEFF: All right.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.703
It is time to vote.

40:04.736 --> 40:14.780
Katrina, you're up.

40:14.780 --> 40:21.787
Katrina, you're up.

40:33.932 --> 40:40.639
I'll go tally the votes.

40:40.672 --> 40:44.710
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

40:44.743 --> 40:49.247
now would be the time to do so.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.215
Okay.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.316
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.852
The person voted out will be
