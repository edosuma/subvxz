WEBVTT

00:06.339 --> 00:08.800
How about a special discount?

00:08.883 --> 00:12.303
Um, for the next two weeks, um,

00:12.387 --> 00:17.434
non-violent felonies, 50 percent off. Yeah.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.186
- Okay.
- I'll take one.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.315
Yeah. That's for you. Fifty percent off.
Yeah, all right. Now we got some takers.

00:24.399 --> 00:29.195
There you are. Oh, yeah.
Who else? Fifty percent off. There you are.

00:29.279 --> 00:33.074
-Fifty percent off.
-Dude, that's almost half.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.304
Hey! You bastards!

00:54.387 --> 00:56.014
Fifty percent off!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.604
Money, money, money!

01:02.687 --> 01:04.189
Money, money, money.

01:11.654 --> 01:12.906
Yeah!

01:38.598 --> 01:41.768
Yeah! I got my money! Yeah!

01:43.728 --> 01:44.562
Yeah.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.243
Get back here, you little bitch!

01:59.202 --> 02:01.204
Ow! I'm okay! Ha, ha.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.374
Fifty percent off!

02:21.641 --> 02:22.851
Whoo!

02:25.145 --> 02:27.021
-Yeah!
-Woo-hoo!

02:50.962 --> 02:52.088
-Yo.
-What?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.756
-Dude.
-What?

02:55.133 --> 02:56.843
What day is it?

02:56.926 --> 02:58.344
Uh...

02:59.220 --> 03:00.430
Tuesday?

03:03.808 --> 03:04.893
Tuesday?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.771
-What?
-You know what that means?

03:10.398 --> 03:12.650
Fifty percent off!

03:51.564 --> 03:54.108

Baby, what's happening?

04:32.480 --> 04:34.065
What's happening, baby?

04:35.525 --> 04:36.776
Get off of me, man.

04:42.907 --> 04:43.992
It's okay.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.124
Come on, man. What do you want from me?

04:51.207 --> 04:54.502
I switched the stuff.
I played it all like he told me.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.397
No.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.399
No.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.112
What are we doing?

05:23.072 --> 05:25.325
Come on, man. Don't.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.701
You got five people in there.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.660
Too bad.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.163
Hey, wait! Wait. Wait.

05:30.246 --> 05:34.167
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait. Hey, wait!

05:34.250 --> 05:35.418
Why is he doing this?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.587
Hey, why is he doing this? I did everything.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.671
Wait.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.926
Please, man.
Please, man, please, no. Please, no.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.596
Please. Man, please.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.307
Please, man.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.251
Okay.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.544
I get it.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.549
Just tell me what you want me to do.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.471
Lalo Salamanca.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.517
I need to know where he is going.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.852
What he is thinking.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.271
What he's planning.

06:37.355 --> 06:41.109
I need to know what he's going to do
before he does it.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.779
I've been trying, okay?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.823
He doesn't tell me shit.

06:46.906 --> 06:51.327
He's just keeps talking about some guy
named Werner Ziegler.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.372
And some <i>gringo</i> "Michael." That's it.

06:58.292 --> 07:03.131
Gain his confidence. Make him rely on you.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.215
How?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.095
Find a way.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.857
My father has nothing to do with this.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.702
I'll find a way. I'll make him trust me.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.205
Okay?

08:12.742 --> 08:14.577
Your pop's a nice guy.

08:26.714 --> 08:31.177
Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure. Ahem.
Let me see if I have this right.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.181
A Mr. Bertram Moran, aka "B-Mo,"

08:35.264 --> 08:38.601
claims that you solicited him
for the purchase of narcotics

08:38.684 --> 08:43.231
when, in fact, you were simply enjoying
a Big Gulp in the park

08:43.314 --> 08:46.025
when he approached
and attempted to sell to you.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.611
Oh! I got a live one. Ahem.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.404
Yes, PJ. Go ahead.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.203
Kim, sorry. My side is too full.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.498
I'm gonna take some of those
back to Mrs. Nguyen's.

09:01.832 --> 09:02.708
Yeah, uh-huh.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.170
Well, I think I got the specifics.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.630
I'll call you later.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.423
Geez. A chatty one.

09:09.507 --> 09:15.596
So, hey, how's it going with, uh, "Cold Finger,"
the mini-fridge mastermind?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.974
-Did you get a trial date yet?
-Uh...

09:18.057 --> 09:20.560
No. He took the deal.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.938
He took the five months?

09:24.021 --> 09:25.481
-Yup.
-Huh.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.566
You were right, as usual.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.320
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.699
Yes, miss. I-- Uh-huh.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.412
Oh, no. Ha, ha. Well, that's not right.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.913
Yeah. Go on.

09:42.123 --> 09:46.294
Can you hold for a moment?
Kim, how about dinner and a movie tonight?

09:46.377 --> 09:52.133
I'm-- Scampi and Scorsese because they got
<i>After Hours</i> on the Classic Movie Channel.

09:52.216 --> 09:56.220
I love that one, but, um, we'll have to see.
I might need to stay late.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.472
Okay. Just let me know.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.766
Yeah. I'll see you.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.691
Yes, go ahead.
There's something about a minivan?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.711
-Kim.
-Jimmy, what are you--?

10:28.794 --> 10:32.381
There's something I gotta show you.
It's just three blocks from here.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.300
Look, I-- Sorry.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.597
I know you gotta get to work.
This will only take a couple of minutes, please.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.476
Drive. If we go right now, it will be over like that.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.065
-Which way?
-Take a right.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.367
There. Right there.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.203
- The white one?
- Yeah. That one. Right there.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.757
Jimmy, we're not buying a house.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.344
Maybe not today,
but doesn't hurt to look, does it?

11:19.804 --> 11:25.017
I drove by this place like a week ago,
and I'm curious. Aren't you, just a little?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.186
Look at all that space.

11:28.396 --> 11:33.984
Hey, you're doing great.
I'm gonna be doing great. I got 45 clients.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.779
Forty-five? How are you gonna handle all that?

11:36.862 --> 11:39.281
I got a system, but can we just look?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.202
They're not even open yet.

11:43.285 --> 11:46.789
Yeah, well. They want to sell this house.
They'll let us in.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.502
All right.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.980
Hey, folks. Do you mind signing in?

12:11.063 --> 12:13.315
There's a guestbook right over here.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.735
You know what?
Um, could we do that on our way out?

12:16.819 --> 12:17.653
Sure.

12:17.736 --> 12:21.031
Just take your time. Have a look around.
Let me know if you have any questions.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.658
-You got it.
-Thanks.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.746
Man, look at all this wall space.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.752
Imagine a plasma TV mounted right there.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.338
One of the huge new ones.

12:38.340 --> 12:42.052
Hey, this would be a big change,
but we could make it our own.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.638
We could host movie nights.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.767
Some comfy chairs
and smell of popcorn in the air, and--

12:48.851 --> 12:51.145
And check out these countertops.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.354
Yeah.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.192
Blue. Is this quartz?

12:56.275 --> 12:58.819
I read somewhere that it's good for healing.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.030
Mm. So good for healing.

13:09.497 --> 13:14.877
Hey. You know that, uh, "50 percent off" thing
I said I wouldn't do?

13:14.960 --> 13:16.504
Well, I did it.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.258
I, uh, told a few potential clients.
It just kind of slipped out.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.843
Don't worry. I know these people.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.513
They're not gonna do anything
because of some stupid discount.

13:25.596 --> 13:29.350
But it was a bonehead move
and I shouldn't have done it.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.440
Okay.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.881
Jimmy, I know you were trying to help,

14:02.675 --> 14:04.885
but I don't want to lie to my clients.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.055
Are you talking about the fridge guy?
That was a dumb idea.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.807
I mean all my clients.

14:11.475 --> 14:15.062
Of course. Absolutely. Never again.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.952
Oh, my God.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.499
-This is the closet of your dreams.
-Our dreams.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.085
Sure.

14:38.168 --> 14:42.423
Where are my Louboutins?
Louboutins? Louboutins?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.677
Hey, check this out.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.642
-Oh, there's jets.
-Yeah, it's like a mini spa.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.186
That would be so nice
after a long day on our feet.

14:56.270 --> 15:00.816
Yeah. And two sinks.
So plenty of room for brushing.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.735
-And spitting.
-Mm.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.695
Hey, you gotta see this.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.824
I mean, look at all the nozzles.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.704
-Whoa.
-Yeah. Is that what I think it is?

15:13.787 --> 15:14.788
Steam?

15:15.623 --> 15:18.250
But, uh, how do you get it going?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.337
Maybe the water's shut off.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.755
Maybe.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.133
Hey. Ah...

15:26.216 --> 15:27.384
Quit it.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.472
You're-- Very mature. Very mature.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.774
Thanks again.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.785
Nice house, huh?

15:53.827 --> 15:56.413
Yeah. Maybe someday.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.647
Hang on, Tio.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.193
Excuse me, Mr. Salamanca.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.947
Would you give your uncle some of this?
It's Fizzy K. He needs to hydrate.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.323
Fizzy K?

16:31.407 --> 16:36.704
It's just a vitamin solution.
It's very berry, his favorite. Right, Hector?

16:36.787 --> 16:39.832
-Thanks. I'll make sure he drinks it.
-Thank you.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.516
Look, Tio.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.828
What's he doing?

17:20.622 --> 17:23.417
He's building something.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.130
A tunnel...

17:29.339 --> 17:32.634
A lab... maybe a vault?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.845
He's preparing for something big.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.600
He lies to me with this shit about the Germans.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.853
Maybe Eladio and Bolsa believe it
but I don't.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.482
But what can I do?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.945
They don't give a shit.
As long as he makes them cash.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.532
What?

17:57.284 --> 17:58.327
You mean the money?

18:00.245 --> 18:01.330
Right...

18:02.456 --> 18:04.500
The money.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.710
As long as he brings in the money,
he's protected.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.928
Gross, Tio.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.472
This is shit.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.571
Let's see. Better, no?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.743
Yeah?

19:21.827 --> 19:25.164
<i>Mike, hi. I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

19:25.247 --> 19:27.875
No, no bother, honey. What's up?

19:27.958 --> 19:31.712
<i>I don't know what your work schedule</i>
<i>is like these days.</i>

19:31.795 --> 19:33.839
I'm still making my own hours.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.675
<i>Well, I just got called in.</i>

19:36.758 --> 19:39.219
<i>-Emily's busy, and--</i>
-No problem.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.679
<i>Are you sure?</i>

19:40.762 --> 19:43.473
Positive. I'll be happy to watch her.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.561
-What time do you need me there?
-<i>How about now?</i>

19:49.813 --> 19:50.772
Now.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.359
On the way.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.029
<i>Oh, thanks, Mike. You're a lifesaver.</i>

19:57.112 --> 19:58.113
Yeah.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.700
-Hey!
-Hey.

20:01.783 --> 20:05.537
I thought we'd finish fixing the ladder
on the treehouse.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.706
-Pop-Pop!
-Hey, kid.

20:07.789 --> 20:11.752
She needs to finish her homework first.
Don't let her sweet-talk you.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.378
No, not a chance of that.

20:13.462 --> 20:17.090
She gotta learn her times tables.
She's on the sevens.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.467
Sevens?

20:19.718 --> 20:22.930
There's lasagna in the oven
and I should be back before bedtime.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.848
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.976
-See you later, sweetie!
-Bye, Mom!

20:28.060 --> 20:29.019
Bye.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.692
What do we got?

20:35.776 --> 20:37.486
Sevens are the worst.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.904
Oh...

20:38.987 --> 20:42.407
I bet you know more than you think you know.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.326
-I do?
-Mm-hm.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.246
You remember when we watched
the Super Bowl?

20:49.164 --> 20:51.333
Seven times three?

20:51.416 --> 20:55.420
- Twenty-one.
- Right. Seven times four?

20:55.504 --> 20:58.674
- Four touchdowns equals 28.
- Mm-hm.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.302
Plus another one makes 35.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.180
Go, Eagles! Kick ass.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.058
You don't talk like that.
Who taught you to talk like that?

21:08.141 --> 21:10.102
-You did.
-Oh.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.273
Come on. Seven times eight?

21:14.356 --> 21:15.899
Uh...

21:15.983 --> 21:19.027
-That's a lot of touchdowns.
-It's a lot of touchdowns.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.363
It's a big game. Where are we at?

21:21.446 --> 21:24.366
-Fifty-five?
-Oh.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.827
So you think the kicker
missed the extra point?

21:26.910 --> 21:29.830
Oh, no. It's 56.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.332
Seven times eight is 56.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.375
You got it.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.046
My dad liked the Eagles, right?

21:39.631 --> 21:41.758
Yeah. He sure did.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.468
Was he good at math?

21:44.511 --> 21:46.596
-Thank you.
-Yeah, he, uh...

21:48.348 --> 21:50.183
Your daddy was a smart kid.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.769
A good student like you.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.274
Did he want to be a policeman
when he was my age?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.192
When he was your age...

22:00.319 --> 22:06.283
You know, I think he went back and forth
between an astronaut, deep sea explorer

22:06.366 --> 22:08.410
like Jacques Cousteau.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.536
Who?

22:09.619 --> 22:12.372
-You don't know Jacques Cousteau?
-Mm-mm.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.249
Well, we'll fix that.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.252
So instead, my dad decided to be a policeman.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.170
Like you.

22:19.546 --> 22:20.380
Yeah.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.800
Hey, make sure those are nice and even.

22:25.761 --> 22:29.014
And he was a really good policeman, right?

22:33.435 --> 22:34.269
Yes.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.607
-And you taught him.
-Uh-huh.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.026
But...

22:41.109 --> 22:42.819
the bad guys got him?

22:45.489 --> 22:48.492
-I told you to make those even.
-I am.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.870
No, you're not! You're making a mess.

22:51.953 --> 22:54.039
You either do it right, or you don't do it.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.332
But I wanna do it.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.167
You're done. You are done!

23:14.392 --> 23:15.727
Hey.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.022
-Where's Kaylee?
-She's in her room. She won't come out.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.691
-She didn't eat dinner.
-Why? What happened?

26:02.602 --> 26:03.478

26:04.145 --> 26:06.022
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, man.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.871
It's too deep for me.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.877
- Ha, ha.
- Oof. Ugh.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.504
And did I get you?

26:29.587 --> 26:31.047
Let me see what you had.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.509
You had a set?

26:36.052 --> 26:38.847
Mm. You had three eights on the turn,
and you don't raise?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.890
And then you fold at the river?

26:40.974 --> 26:42.309

28:22.826 --> 28:25.537

28:52.147 --> 28:55.442

but he was stuck up there.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.994
Shit, whole block's crawling.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.331
You got the stuff?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.210
-You got it?
-Nah.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.920

the whole place upside-down.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.521
How much is in there?

29:36.608 --> 29:37.942
Almost a full load.

29:48.411 --> 29:49.454
Wait, where you going?

29:49.537 --> 29:52.957
What the hell are you doing?

29:54.626 --> 29:59.506
Stupid idiot, they're going to catch your ass.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.236
Where'd he go?

30:23.696 --> 30:24.739
There he is.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.951
Ooh!

30:28.535 --> 30:30.078
He's on the roof!

30:30.161 --> 30:33.581
This is gonna be good.

30:34.749 --> 30:35.959
No.

30:36.876 --> 30:41.214

31:03.611 --> 31:05.488
Bye-bye, Nachito.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.891
Police! Open up!

31:34.684 --> 31:37.061
We got a fortified door. Need to breach.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.695
Police!

31:48.114 --> 31:49.282
Clear!

31:51.200 --> 31:52.702
What's happening?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.335
Did they get him?

32:00.418 --> 32:01.336
They must've got--

32:14.807 --> 32:16.184
Ignacio Varga...

32:17.477 --> 32:18.770
You are a badass.

32:25.777 --> 32:26.903
Suzanne...

32:26.986 --> 32:28.196
Oh, Suzanne!

32:28.279 --> 32:31.449
Suzanne, I think we have
something in common.

32:32.492 --> 32:36.204
Suzanne, I think we have something

32:41.834 --> 32:44.921
Suzanne, I think we have
something in common.

-What?

32:49.425 --> 32:51.135

32:51.219 --> 32:53.471
No, but by the way, you look great.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.556
We gotta talk Bruno Leder.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.183
Leder? Lost cause.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.477
-Ah, I beg to differ.
-He assaulted a minor.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.105
That oaf? You call him a minor,
I call him a menace.

33:02.188 --> 33:05.942
Hey, my featherweight was simply
defending himself against your raging bull.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.986
No sale. Leder's doing the full freight.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.445
Welcome back to the law, McGill.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.656
It's Goodman. And you'll be back.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.867
-Hannah-Banana.
-Hi!

33:14.951 --> 33:18.121
Hey. What's the word
on moving Tripp to Thursday?

33:18.204 --> 33:21.749
-It works on the calendar, just have to check...
-Consider them checked!

33:21.833 --> 33:22.667
Veronica.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.378
-She's finally clear. Go ahead.
-Hey, you got something for me?

33:29.465 --> 33:31.551
<i>Muchas</i> gracias. All right, let's see.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.262
Long sleeves, covering the tats, that's excellent.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.557
Pull your hair back and lose the hardware.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.934
Her Honor doth protest a chin pillar.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.937
-But it's gonna close up.
-Into every life, a little rain must fall.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.356
Meet me outside Courtroom 103 at 2:15.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.651
Mitch! Uh, what say you
to moving Tripp to Thursday?

33:48.735 --> 33:52.113
-Mm, Thursday works.
-Great. Thursday.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.366
-What did you do?
-I don't know. What did I do?

33:55.450 --> 33:57.535
Suddenly, Leder has witnesses?

33:57.618 --> 33:59.704
What can I say? People step up.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.122
From the sewer?

34:01.205 --> 34:03.124
Life's rich pageant, who are we to judge?

34:03.207 --> 34:05.585
Anyway, they saw what they saw.

34:05.668 --> 34:09.005
Your beefy, if youthful hooligan,
cold-cocks my small potato.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.799
So, what do you say, uh, sentence suspended,

34:11.883 --> 34:14.969
six months' probation,
70 hours community service?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.763
Yeah, I guess.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.014
That's the spirit.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.026
Suzanne, I think we have something

34:30.109 --> 34:31.319
in common.

34:34.363 --> 34:37.075
Suzanne, I think we have
something in common.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.329
-Suzanne, I--
-Jimmy!

34:42.080 --> 34:44.457
-Howard, hey.
-Congratulations.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.751
-You're back in the saddle.
-Yeah.

34:48.836 --> 34:50.463
So...

34:50.546 --> 34:51.464
Saul Goodman?

34:53.216 --> 34:54.509
Yeah, that's me.

34:56.010 --> 34:56.928
How's business?

34:57.887 --> 35:00.431
It's good. It's very good. You?

35:00.515 --> 35:03.601
Actually, it looks like it's gonna be
one of our best years ever.

35:03.684 --> 35:06.938
I was wondering, any chance
you're available for lunch some time?

35:07.021 --> 35:08.606
Lunch? Lunch? Really?

35:08.689 --> 35:12.777
Yeah. Have Julie call my people.
I'm in the book. See you, Howard.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.238
Suzanne, I think we have
a few things in common.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.115
-Oh, I hope not.
-Oh, we do.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.200
To the tune of 16 cases.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.494
So you're busy, I'm busy.

35:21.577 --> 35:25.832
How about we do a lightning round,
we'll settle these puppies, 20 minutes?

35:25.915 --> 35:28.000
Don't you already have
an appointment with me?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.210
Yeah, next Tuesday.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.838
But, you know, let's get it done right now.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.631
How about we wait till next Tuesday?

35:33.714 --> 35:36.175
My clients need answers.

35:36.259 --> 35:40.012
Look, you've got a problem with me, that's fine.
Don't take it out on my clients.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.515
This isn't about your clients.
This is about your wallet.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.725
-Okay, slow down--
-You're looking for turnover.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.770
You wanna churn through more clients,
make more money.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.398
That's your problem, not mine.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.859
Uh, Suzanne, I'm outraged.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.305
They say it's clear out there.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.390
Should I tell the guys to move out?

36:24.473 --> 36:26.809
Ignacio, it's your call.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.065
Okay.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.454
Hey!

36:47.121 --> 36:48.581
Grab two Modelos.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.305

37:28.913 --> 37:30.373
Your friend, um...

37:33.125 --> 37:34.085

37:35.670 --> 37:36.837
Yeah. Domingo.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.382
-I know him a long time.
-Mm.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.550
How?

37:42.343 --> 37:44.345
-My family knows his family.
-Mm.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.226
Has he ever been inside before?

37:52.228 --> 37:53.062
No.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.315
You worried about him?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.032
No, man, he'll keep his mouth shut.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.203
Mm-hm.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.969
You want me to take care of it?

38:27.930 --> 38:29.432
No.

38:29.515 --> 38:31.267
I got something much better for him.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.437
Come on.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.651
I need you to call Beau Bindler
and set a meeting for tomorrow a.m.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.570
so we can prep him for the deposition.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.156
-Got it.
-And maybe bring bagels.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.490
The guy eats his feelings.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.783
Bagels, check.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.660
-So yeah. See you tomorrow.
-All right.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.788
Okay, let's review.

38:52.872 --> 38:57.543
Your sister, Nancy, attacked your girlfriend,
also named Nancy, with a curling iron?

38:57.626 --> 39:00.212
I'm gonna need a face-to-face
so I know who I'm representing.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.757
Look, I'm in an elevator.
Now I'm gonna lose you.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.008
Hello? Okay.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.179
Oh, no.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.805
No, no, no.

39:09.889 --> 39:10.931
No!

39:12.433 --> 39:14.352
Hey! Hello?

39:16.145 --> 39:17.813
Hi, this is ADA Ericsen.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.940
We're in the south bank of the elevator...

39:20.024 --> 39:22.526
-Goddamn it!
-Please!

39:22.610 --> 39:25.488
Sorry, we're stuck between floors two and three.

39:26.781 --> 39:27.740
Yeah. How long?

39:29.950 --> 39:30.785
Thanks.

39:33.537 --> 39:34.789
And?

39:34.872 --> 39:36.123
They're sending someone.

39:36.832 --> 39:38.000
It's gonna be a minute.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.587
I can't believe this.

39:57.603 --> 40:01.315
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you,

40:01.399 --> 40:04.360
what is this trial really about?

40:06.570 --> 40:09.073
The state may call it vandalism,

40:09.156 --> 40:13.536
but I call my client's brave act of social justice

40:13.619 --> 40:16.372
constitutionally-protected free speech."

40:16.455 --> 40:17.790
-Really?
-That--

40:19.250 --> 40:21.293
I gotta use my time.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.170
Can you do it silently?

40:24.171 --> 40:25.464
Uh, yeah, sure.

40:30.219 --> 40:35.975
"My client is a young man of deep moral fortitude--

40:36.058 --> 40:38.185
Moral fortitude.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.937
--with a passion for progress.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.690
P-- P-- Mm-hm.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.941
A solid citizen."

40:44.024 --> 40:45.776
No, no, no.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.362
"A dedicated citizen

40:48.446 --> 40:51.782
with a voice that needs to ring out!"

40:51.866 --> 40:52.825
Name one.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.326
Mm?

40:54.410 --> 40:55.744
I'm sorry?

40:55.828 --> 40:57.037
One of the cases.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.290
One of our cases?

40:59.373 --> 41:01.917
Oh, let me think. Uh, Veronica Nix.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.210
Motor vehicle theft?

41:03.294 --> 41:05.129
With mitigating circumstances.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.006
Such as...?

41:07.089 --> 41:08.507
It was her aunt's minivan.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.009
That's already baked in.

41:10.092 --> 41:14.180
It was parked in the driveway.
The old lady was berating her, so...

41:14.263 --> 41:15.139
So, what?

41:15.222 --> 41:20.019
So, you know, good luck finding a jury
that's never been reamed out by a relative.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.317
-One year probation.
-Sold.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.735
-Just like that?
-Yup.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.821
What do you say we look at, uh...

41:31.780 --> 41:33.073
Jerome Sheehan?

41:34.074 --> 41:37.244
So full year supervised for Drew Kirkman?

41:37.328 --> 41:39.914
-How about 18 months?
-Eighteen it is.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.209
Next up, we got...

41:43.876 --> 41:45.586
Tanika Berman.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.214
Ah, um...

41:48.297 --> 41:49.965
Four months jail?

41:50.049 --> 41:52.801
The vampire stunt? That was negligent arson.

41:52.885 --> 41:55.554
Well, it was more of a prank gone wrong.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.681
The knife was real.

41:57.765 --> 42:00.643
Yeah, but it was used as a prop.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.144
Was the fire a prop?

42:04.021 --> 42:06.106
The blood was fake.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.109
-How is that relevant?
-Petty misdemeanor.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.612
Plus fourth-degree felony.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.449
But, uh, drop the property damage?

42:16.450 --> 42:18.744
-Keep the weapons charge.
-Uh...

42:18.827 --> 42:19.954
Fourteen months jail?

42:20.037 --> 42:21.830
Ha. Sixteen.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.749
Mm... Sixteen.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.084
Plus, fines, TBD.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.421
Plus, fines, TBD.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.339
All right.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.469
Oh, hey, look at that.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.179
Oh, finally.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.016
Hmm. Twenty minutes.

42:51.652 --> 42:53.612
Pleasure doing business with you.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.114
Sure.

42:55.197 --> 42:57.950
See you next week. For the last three!

43:02.705 --> 43:05.124
Legal services for the other half?

43:06.166 --> 43:07.585
So my brother's little problem?

43:07.668 --> 43:10.588
His record will be cleaner
than <i>Doris Day's Greatest Hits.</i>

43:10.671 --> 43:12.298
Catch you on the flip-flop.

43:22.016 --> 43:23.434
Mm.

43:23.517 --> 43:26.103
Seventy hours is a breeze, trust me.

43:26.186 --> 43:28.397
Think of all the good that you'll do.

43:28.480 --> 43:31.108
Bruno, good talking to you. I gotta jump.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.152
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

43:33.235 --> 43:34.737
Miss Hower!

43:34.820 --> 43:36.614
Hey, have I got good news.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.575
I had to strap on the old armor
and do some jousting, but--

43:40.659 --> 43:44.705
It's what knights used to do
back in olden times...

43:47.291 --> 43:49.293
Uh, you know what? I'll call you back.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.925
Mr. Varga, long time no see.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.594
Get in.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.014
Uh...

44:03.015 --> 44:05.684
Your timing isn't perfect. Um...

44:05.768 --> 44:07.728
I'm a little swamped right now.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.611
We're just going for a ride, or...?

44:16.820 --> 44:18.280
Uh...

44:22.618 --> 44:24.119
Uh.
