Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:02.065 --> 00:04.133
Someone close to us is working

00:04.201 --> 00:06.669
with Stanton Parish.
You said that you would

00:06.737 --> 00:08.738
bring him around
to our way of thinking,

00:08.805 --> 00:11.650
but you two are farther apart
than you've ever been.

00:11.717 --> 00:13.765
Do you understand everything
I'm risking for this?

00:13.833 --> 00:17.232
This is actually
pretty friggin' perfect.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.963
I love you.
You know that?

00:21.031 --> 00:22.128
Put your hands on your head.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.466
I want you to lay face down.

00:24.533 --> 00:27.433
- Easy.
- You turned her in!

00:27.501 --> 00:29.735
You were supposed
to protect her.

00:29.803 --> 00:31.834
I just want to forget.
I want to disappear.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.601
No! There's
an opportunity here.

00:33.669 --> 00:35.038
Eh...

00:35.105 --> 00:38.241
Yes, there is a way out.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.670 --> 01:00.938
This is the plea agreement.

01:01.005 --> 01:03.440
You need to initial

01:03.508 --> 01:06.908
all the boxes that are
highlighted, and, uh...

01:06.976 --> 01:10.944
and, yes, sign the last page.

01:11.011 --> 01:13.112
The paperwork.

01:13.180 --> 01:14.713
Right.

01:14.781 --> 01:17.250
Uh, I do hereby
solemnly swear

01:17.318 --> 01:22.723
to go undercover,
cozy up to Stanton Parish,

01:22.791 --> 01:27.629
and figure out
what he is planning, um...

01:27.696 --> 01:30.032
Ah! Rat him out.

01:32.402 --> 01:35.704
So...

01:35.772 --> 01:38.107
I'll take it to Cley.

01:38.175 --> 01:41.109
- Dad.
- Hmm?

01:41.177 --> 01:42.277
Just breathe.

01:42.345 --> 01:44.280
Okay?

01:44.348 --> 01:46.048
I'm a big girl.

01:46.116 --> 01:47.750
I don't need training wheels.

01:47.818 --> 01:49.885
Well, there's
a lot more at stake than

01:49.953 --> 01:51.854
a skinned knee, Dani.

01:51.922 --> 01:54.024
Stanton Parish is a sociopath,
you know, he's--

01:54.091 --> 01:56.125
I know.

01:56.193 --> 01:57.360
But he trusts me.

01:57.428 --> 01:59.496
I got this.

01:59.563 --> 02:03.066
I'll be okay.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.775
Dani missed our last meeting,
and hasn't responded

02:13.843 --> 02:15.977
to my check-in signals
for over a week.

02:16.045 --> 02:17.846
Cley thinks that she may
still be loyal to Parish,

02:17.914 --> 02:19.148
but I'm concerned she might
be in trouble.

02:19.216 --> 02:21.817
So you sent her in there?

02:21.885 --> 02:23.720
You actually sent
her back to him?

02:23.787 --> 02:25.922
Doc, don't you think I should
have been brought in on this?

02:25.990 --> 02:27.357
It was for operational
security reasons...

02:27.425 --> 02:28.691
- No, no, this is between us.
- Right, Dr. Rosen?

02:28.759 --> 02:29.592
- We had an agreement, right?
- No, no, no.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.395
Cley insisted, and I agreed.

02:31.463 --> 02:32.763
The fewer people who knew,

02:32.831 --> 02:33.831
the less risk there would
be to Dani.

02:33.898 --> 02:35.499
Oh, and keeping Dani safe.

02:35.566 --> 02:37.167
That was your first priority,
huh?

02:37.235 --> 02:39.069
If she hadn't agreed
to this, Cameron,

02:39.137 --> 02:41.005
she would have spent the rest
of her life in Building Seven.

02:41.072 --> 02:42.640
Or worse.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.142
She come up with that
brilliant idea herself, Doc,

02:44.209 --> 02:45.409
or you head shrink
that into her?

02:45.477 --> 02:46.944
- That's uncalled for, Cameron.
- Uncalled for?

02:47.012 --> 02:48.345
Okay, we're all just trying
to wrap our heads around--

02:48.413 --> 02:49.546
You put your own daughter's
head on the block,

02:49.614 --> 02:51.882
and I'm out of order?

02:51.949 --> 02:53.517
You know what?

02:53.584 --> 02:55.185
I'm starting to think
she's better off with Parish.

02:55.253 --> 02:57.187
- Hicks. Please, Hicks.
- Rachel.

02:57.255 --> 03:01.291
Rachel! Rachel.

03:09.568 --> 03:12.804
Cameron.

03:12.872 --> 03:13.938
Cameron, you and I
should talk about this.

03:14.006 --> 03:15.273
No, we shouldn't.

03:15.341 --> 03:18.309
I did what I had to do
to protect my daughter.

03:18.377 --> 03:19.444
Really?

03:19.512 --> 03:20.946
'Cause the way I see it,

03:21.014 --> 03:23.181
Dani would have been perfectly
safe sitting in Building Seven,

03:23.249 --> 03:24.416
while you pulled your little
strings to get her pardoned.

03:24.484 --> 03:26.218
I couldn't guarantee that.

03:26.286 --> 03:27.886
No, you chose!

03:27.954 --> 03:30.422
You chose to risk her life.

03:30.490 --> 03:31.857
You're using her.

03:31.925 --> 03:33.692
Just like you use everyone.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.762
- That is not--
- Get the hell out of my way!

03:42.769 --> 03:44.470
DARPA is saying
three intruders.

03:44.538 --> 03:46.406
And one of them melted the fence

03:46.474 --> 03:47.474
with his hands.

03:47.542 --> 03:50.143
Cornell Scipio.

03:50.211 --> 03:51.378
I hate that guy.

03:51.446 --> 03:53.981
Gary, any word from Hicks?
No, Bill.

03:54.048 --> 03:57.618
I left him 14 messages.
He should call me back.

04:08.397 --> 04:10.364
Sir, stop right there!

04:17.906 --> 04:19.374
Stop right there!
Drop those bags!

04:36.861 --> 04:39.295
- Is that Cam?
- What the hell is he doing?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.731
We'll meet up at the truck.
Go!

04:41.799 --> 04:43.266
Jeff, move your ass!

04:43.334 --> 04:45.869
We are leaving.

04:45.937 --> 04:49.572
Hicks! Hicks!
Unh!

04:49.640 --> 04:50.940
Let's get in there.

04:51.007 --> 04:51.974
What the hell are you doing?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.476
Whatever it takes.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.344
Harken, stop!

04:59.349 --> 05:01.184
Hey!

05:01.251 --> 05:03.219

That happens.

06:06.452 --> 06:08.686
Occupy DARPA,
and power to the people.

06:08.754 --> 06:10.355
Oh, but that's--that's--
that's not like Hicks, you know?

06:10.422 --> 06:11.923
Doesn't sound like him.

06:11.991 --> 06:13.858
I know, well that's just--
that's a theory, though.

06:13.926 --> 06:15.727
It's my theory.
Which is the best one so far,

06:15.795 --> 06:16.928
'cause it's the only one.

06:16.995 --> 06:17.962
Look
look, it's gotta be Dani.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.530
Nothing else makes sense.

06:19.598 --> 06:21.765
Its okay, that's your theory.
Nina, what's your theory?

06:21.833 --> 06:25.501
Why is he doing this?

06:25.569 --> 06:28.137
I trust him.
That's my theory.

06:40.349 --> 06:41.750
Be careful with those.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.585
They're like the fourth of July,
but with dead people.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.021
- You got it.
- It's a good haul.

06:46.089 --> 06:48.390
Almost 100.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.925
What exactly
are those things for?

06:49.993 --> 06:53.362
Well, that's "need to know,"
and you don't.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.732
So how do you think Rosen's
people found us?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.368
Probably Gary,
and maybe Rachel.

06:59.436 --> 07:01.170
Rosen's been using Alphas
to hunt Alphas

07:01.238 --> 07:03.539
for as long as I've known him.

07:03.607 --> 07:04.940
If you hate
the old man so much,

07:05.008 --> 07:09.010
why didn't you just kill
him before you left?

07:09.078 --> 07:10.712
Dani.

07:12.081 --> 07:14.449
That's why you're doing
all this?

07:14.516 --> 07:16.084
Such a romantic.

07:16.152 --> 07:18.720
This is what they stole.

07:18.788 --> 07:21.890
It's called a Voltaic Grenade.
So what does it do?

07:21.958 --> 07:23.859
It fires off electricity.

07:23.926 --> 07:25.794
And if the charge
hits power lines,

07:25.861 --> 07:27.929
or anything with a live current,
it overloads them,

07:27.997 --> 07:29.364
setting off a chain reaction.

07:29.432 --> 07:33.368
That's neat.
DARPA does make neat things.

07:33.436 --> 07:34.803
There's nothing
neat about this, Gary.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.638
That electrical storm
at DARPA took down three people.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.673
That's off of
one of these grenades.

07:37.740 --> 07:39.207
And it would've gotten us too,

07:39.275 --> 07:40.676
if we were a few feet closer.

07:40.743 --> 07:44.446
If you set just one of these
off in the wrong place...

07:44.513 --> 07:46.280
a subway junction box,
or anywhere

07:46.348 --> 07:48.182
where a bunch
of power lines cross...

07:48.250 --> 07:50.050
hundreds of people could die.

07:50.118 --> 07:53.587
And multiply that by
60 or 70 grenades, it's...

07:53.655 --> 07:55.088
it's a lot of people.

07:55.156 --> 07:58.592
Why would Cameron go along
with something like this?

07:58.660 --> 08:00.027
Do you have a theory,
Dr. Rosen?

08:00.095 --> 08:01.262
And you can't say that

08:01.329 --> 08:03.364
you trust him,
or that it's Dani,

08:03.432 --> 08:04.799
'cause we've already said those.

08:04.866 --> 08:08.903
Well, motives are not
what's important right now.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.406
No, preventing Parish
from deploying these weapons is.

08:11.474 --> 08:12.807
But we need
to find Hicks and Dani.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.576
Yes, we do.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.044
But that's
of secondary importance

08:16.112 --> 08:18.179
right now, unfortunately.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.949
This is job number one.

08:21.016 --> 08:22.383
It's not just Dani.

08:22.451 --> 08:24.552
Rosen, the government,
everyone's trying to control us,

08:24.620 --> 08:27.088
like we're some kind of problem.

08:27.156 --> 08:29.390
I want to be the solution.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.292
Well, you talk the talk,
I'll give you that.

08:31.359 --> 08:35.361
Look, I got Parish
his little toys.

08:35.429 --> 08:36.496
Tell him to sit down with me,
face to face.

08:36.563 --> 08:37.798
Well, you're getting there.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.332
There's something
you have to do first.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.236
This way.

08:56.716 --> 08:58.516
Agnes.

08:58.584 --> 09:01.420
This is Cameron Hicks.

09:01.487 --> 09:06.524
Hmm. Tall.

09:06.591 --> 09:07.892
Stanton thought we should talk.

09:07.959 --> 09:11.128
I got nothing to hide.

09:11.196 --> 09:12.262
When it comes to Agnes,

09:12.330 --> 09:16.766
nobody does.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.773
Sorry I have to tie you down.

09:26.912 --> 09:28.947
It's safer this way.

09:29.015 --> 09:30.248
Kinky.

09:30.316 --> 09:32.550
You do this to all
of Parish's people?

09:32.618 --> 09:36.487
I'm the official greeter.

09:36.554 --> 09:38.689
Right.

09:38.756 --> 09:40.591
So, what are you gonna do?

09:40.658 --> 09:42.125
You gonna hypnotize me,

09:42.193 --> 09:45.629
or just ask me really nicely?

09:45.697 --> 09:50.000
When I touch someone,
it rips open their mind.

09:50.068 --> 09:51.268
That doesn't
sound very pleasant.

09:51.336 --> 09:52.936
You might want
to clench your jaw.

09:53.004 --> 09:55.272
Does that help?

09:55.340 --> 09:58.141
No, I just don't want you
to bite off your tongue.

10:05.550 --> 10:08.085
So, Cameron Hicks.

10:08.153 --> 10:11.589
What's on your mind?

10:38.891 --> 10:40.458
All this time,
your dad has been telling us

10:40.526 --> 10:42.093
that Parish is the big bad,
right?

10:42.161 --> 10:45.229
Everybody else was
all about Alpha rights,

10:45.297 --> 10:47.231
government oppression, but...

10:47.299 --> 10:49.634
all Parish wanted to talk about
was how screwed up

10:49.702 --> 10:52.337
the world is,
and how Alphas could fix it.

10:52.404 --> 10:54.872
Better people, better world.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.275
Catchy.

11:01.147 --> 11:03.481
If you really want answers,

11:03.549 --> 11:05.850
I could dig through some
old contact numbers.

11:05.918 --> 11:09.687
You two could have lunch.

11:09.755 --> 11:10.989
Seriously?

11:11.057 --> 11:13.425
You're cute
when you're confused.

11:24.304 --> 11:25.404
You okay?

11:25.472 --> 11:30.376
Oh, yeah, I'm great.
Thanks.

11:30.444 --> 11:33.078
Try this.

11:33.146 --> 11:37.115
It helps.

11:37.183 --> 11:40.085
You like your privacy.

11:40.152 --> 11:42.053
You have a lot
of strong walls in there.

11:42.121 --> 11:43.755
Trust me,
I am trying to be open.

11:43.822 --> 11:47.358
You're very convincing.

11:47.425 --> 11:49.994
I wish I didn't have
to cause you so much pain.

11:50.061 --> 11:52.463
Oh, yeah.
Sucks for you.

11:52.531 --> 11:55.099
It does, actually.

11:57.636 --> 12:00.205
You can't turn it off.

12:00.273 --> 12:02.540
No.

12:02.608 --> 12:05.744
I hurt everyone I touch.

12:05.811 --> 12:09.381
You're lucky.

12:09.448 --> 12:12.784
The way you feel about Dani.

12:12.851 --> 12:15.787
Not everyone gets that.

12:15.855 --> 12:17.789
You know, I met her once.

12:17.857 --> 12:20.225
A long time ago.

12:20.292 --> 12:23.662
But I have a feeling
I'm gonna see her again soon.

12:31.538 --> 12:34.407
There's still something
in there.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.576
Something...

12:36.644 --> 12:39.312
out of focus.

12:39.380 --> 12:43.317
Well, we can't have that,
can we?

12:43.385 --> 12:46.187
Let's go.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.626
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

12:51.694 --> 12:54.262
Isn't it a little early
for your pudding?

12:54.330 --> 12:55.864
No, I can eat
it whenever I want.

12:55.931 --> 12:57.098
It's mine.

12:57.166 --> 13:02.371
I bought it with
my own money.

13:02.438 --> 13:04.106
Look...

13:04.174 --> 13:05.541
I know there's
a lot of strangers.

13:05.608 --> 13:07.042
Yeah.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.710
They're just here
to help us find the grenades.

13:08.778 --> 13:11.212
Well...

13:11.280 --> 13:16.950
Hicks was my friend, and--
and Dani's Dr. Rosen's daughter.

13:17.018 --> 13:18.385
But now that
they're breaking the law,

13:18.453 --> 13:20.754
they're hurting people,
now I don't like either of them.

13:20.822 --> 13:23.156
I don't.

13:23.224 --> 13:25.892
Sometimes people do things

13:25.960 --> 13:29.528
for complicated reasons.

13:29.596 --> 13:31.563
I know it's painful,
believe me.

13:35.769 --> 13:38.237
Do you want this?
Do you want my pudding?

13:38.305 --> 13:40.473
I have an extra one.
It's okay.

13:40.540 --> 13:45.411
You might need it.

13:45.478 --> 13:47.980
Oh, Gary.

13:48.048 --> 13:49.415
Gary, listen.
Yep.

13:49.483 --> 13:50.783
I need you to do me a favor.

13:50.851 --> 13:53.285
I need you to look into
that DARPA robbery, okay?

13:53.353 --> 13:54.720
The way Hicks was acting,
you know...

13:54.788 --> 13:56.288
It's just not adding up.

13:56.356 --> 13:59.124
We don't know if Hicks is
a good person or a bad person,

13:59.192 --> 14:01.893
because sometimes people do
things for complicated reasons.

14:01.961 --> 14:06.865
Yeah, tell me about it.

14:06.932 --> 14:08.900
You mind?
No, that's my bookmark.

14:08.968 --> 14:10.368
I'm sorry, here.

14:10.436 --> 14:13.337
How about that?

14:13.405 --> 14:14.638
You're gonna need a spoon.

14:16.508 --> 14:17.742
Maybe not.

14:17.809 --> 14:19.977
That's gross, Bill.

14:38.996 --> 14:42.899
So, did I pass?

14:42.967 --> 14:45.902
Agnes...

14:45.970 --> 14:47.837
gave you top marks.

14:47.905 --> 14:49.505
Why the surprise?

14:49.573 --> 14:50.807
Hmm?

14:50.874 --> 14:52.875
You know why I'm here.

14:52.943 --> 14:57.080
Dani.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.984
She's a very special girl.

15:01.051 --> 15:02.418
It's not just Dani.

15:04.822 --> 15:09.726
Better people, better world.

15:09.794 --> 15:14.096
You're here because
of a slogan?

15:14.164 --> 15:17.033
When can I see her?

15:18.902 --> 15:21.504
That is not possible right now.

15:21.572 --> 15:25.474
But I am glad to see
you're okay, Mr. Hicks.

15:27.577 --> 15:28.611
Wait.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.079
Where is she?

15:30.147 --> 15:31.547
She's comfortable.

15:31.615 --> 15:32.749
I'm keeping her safe

15:32.817 --> 15:35.485
until I find out where
her loyalties lie.

15:35.553 --> 15:36.987
Dani's the one that told
me that you're the good guy,

15:37.055 --> 15:39.322
and now you're saying
you don't even trust her?

15:39.390 --> 15:42.225
Some of her recent actions
have shaken my faith.

15:42.293 --> 15:44.061
Well, Agnes says
that she thinks

15:44.129 --> 15:45.829
she'll be seeing her soon.

15:45.897 --> 15:48.432
Did she?

15:48.500 --> 15:51.135
You'll never know how much I
care about Danielle, Mr. Hicks.

15:51.203 --> 15:53.938
And I would never want
to cause her any pain.

15:54.005 --> 15:59.276
But as you just pointed out,
it's seemingly inevitable.

15:59.344 --> 16:01.579
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hicks.

16:01.646 --> 16:04.382
Get some rest.

16:22.902 --> 16:25.203
I'm heading home.

16:25.271 --> 16:27.339
All right.

16:27.406 --> 16:30.574
Did you even eat today?

16:30.642 --> 16:32.509
You know, I can't recall.

16:37.615 --> 16:38.982
Those grenades.

16:39.050 --> 16:40.450
It's all my fault
they're out there.

16:40.518 --> 16:42.218
At DARPA--
you did your best.

16:42.285 --> 16:43.386
No, but I shouldn't have let--

16:43.453 --> 16:44.587
Nina...

16:44.655 --> 16:46.054
it's my responsibility.

16:46.122 --> 16:49.791
Whatever happens to Cameron,
or Dani, or anyone.

16:49.859 --> 16:52.327
It's my responsibility.

16:52.395 --> 16:53.595
You shouldn't have
to carry that alone.

16:53.663 --> 16:55.197
Yes, I should.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.845
There's some hard-boiled eggs
in the fridge,

17:08.913 --> 17:11.614
and some of that frozen
oatmeal that you like.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.883
Thank you.

17:24.295 --> 17:26.597
Have a good night.

17:26.664 --> 17:29.900
Yeah.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.691
Stanton.

17:54.759 --> 17:55.792
Had a conversation

17:55.860 --> 17:57.561
with your Cameron Hicks today.

17:57.629 --> 17:59.363
Cam?

17:59.431 --> 18:01.632
Seems he recently
joined our cause,

18:01.700 --> 18:04.168
I assume to find you.

18:04.236 --> 18:07.705
Don't hurt him.

18:07.773 --> 18:10.174
I don't want
to hurt anyone, Danielle.

18:10.242 --> 18:11.742
That's why I'm here.

18:11.810 --> 18:13.678
To give you one last chance
to change my mind.

18:24.750 --> 18:28.086
You know when
I started to doubt you?

18:28.153 --> 18:31.556
When I told you the truth about
the world we're creating.

18:31.623 --> 18:33.257
At that moment, there it was.

18:33.325 --> 18:34.558
Betrayal in your eyes.

18:34.626 --> 18:38.529
No, no, I-I was...
Surprised.

18:38.597 --> 18:39.897
Confused.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.165
I-I mean, with the things
you were telling me,

18:41.233 --> 18:42.500
how did you expect me to react?

18:42.568 --> 18:45.670
I expected you to understand.

18:45.738 --> 18:48.573
The human race is evolving
into something magnificent,

18:48.641 --> 18:50.742
but not quite fast enough.

18:50.810 --> 18:52.210
40 years at the most,

18:52.278 --> 18:53.812
and then there's only
one possible result.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.214
I know.
Collapse.

18:56.282 --> 18:57.616
That's a pleasant word
for it.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.721
A population outstrips
the planet's

19:01.788 --> 19:04.757
capacity to provide.

19:04.825 --> 19:08.661
Sacrifices must be made.

19:08.729 --> 19:12.398
Culling the herd.

19:12.466 --> 19:15.868
Stanton, these sacrifices?

19:15.936 --> 19:17.536
You're talking
about killing people.

19:17.604 --> 19:19.472
You're talking
about mass murder.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.809
If we do nothing,
billions will still die.

19:22.877 --> 19:25.045
All that will be left
will be ashes.

19:25.113 --> 19:28.515
But when we succeed,
and we will succeed,

19:28.583 --> 19:31.451
an ideal world,
with resources for all.

19:31.519 --> 19:37.323
The human race perfected.

19:37.391 --> 19:39.525
Ashes or paradise.

19:43.096 --> 19:47.899
Which would you choose?

19:47.967 --> 19:50.635
It's started, hasn't it?

19:50.703 --> 19:53.638
That's why you told me.

19:53.706 --> 19:55.039
Just the first step.

19:55.107 --> 19:57.609
First of a 100, a 1,000.

20:02.848 --> 20:07.786
I want you with me.

20:07.854 --> 20:12.057
You're my family.

20:12.125 --> 20:15.560
I feel the same way
about you.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.362
I want to believe you.

20:22.302 --> 20:26.171
One must be certain.

20:26.239 --> 20:28.074
Agnes Walker will
be calling on you shortly.

20:33.414 --> 20:35.248
Take her below.

21:11.552 --> 21:13.720
All right, people, move!
Out of here now.

21:13.788 --> 21:14.855
Make coffee, do whatever
the hell you gotta do,

21:14.922 --> 21:16.456
but move.
What's wrong?

21:16.524 --> 21:17.924
You need a lawyer.

21:17.992 --> 21:19.593
What are you talking about?

21:19.661 --> 21:21.762
- Hicks.
- Yeah, he's gonna arrest you

21:21.830 --> 21:24.665
now, 'cause of what you did.
We figured it out.

21:24.733 --> 21:26.000
You helped him escape,
didn't you?

21:26.067 --> 21:27.401
At DARPA.

21:27.469 --> 21:28.302
What the hell are you doing?

21:28.370 --> 21:29.403
Whatever it takes.

21:29.471 --> 21:31.272
Harken! No, stop!

21:31.340 --> 21:35.009
Let him go.

21:35.077 --> 21:38.046
I had him.
Then he's gone.

21:38.113 --> 21:39.714
And I couldn't figure out how.
There was--

21:39.782 --> 21:40.916
Something wrong with
the timeline.

21:40.984 --> 21:42.685
But I figured it all out.

21:42.752 --> 21:44.553
Bill lost 6 minutes
and 14 seconds.

21:44.621 --> 21:46.755
- Bill, just calm down.
- No, I'm not gonna calm down!

21:46.823 --> 21:48.590
You pushed me.
Why?

21:48.658 --> 21:50.125
And don't say that people
do things

21:50.193 --> 21:51.660
for complicated reasons.
That's not an answer.

21:51.728 --> 21:52.928
That's true.

21:52.996 --> 21:54.363
Bill, just come
into my office and we'll

21:54.431 --> 21:55.331
talk about this in private.
Hell, no. Hell, no.

21:55.399 --> 21:56.733
So you can push me again?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.068
You helped Parish
get his hands on

21:59.136 --> 22:00.737
those bombs, so he could
kill thousands of people.

22:00.805 --> 22:01.971
- No, no, it's not like that.
- No, shut up!

22:02.039 --> 22:03.440
- It's not like that!
- Shut up!

22:03.507 --> 22:05.342
You know what?
I did what I had to do,

22:05.410 --> 22:07.344
so why don't you save your
self-righteous indignation

22:07.412 --> 22:08.612
for when I actually
deserve it.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.948
- Come here, Nina.
- No, screw you.

22:11.015 --> 22:12.249
- Come here, Nina.
- Screw you!

22:12.316 --> 22:14.584
- No, Doc, Doc, Doc!
- Uh, Bill, Bill--

22:14.652 --> 22:16.586
Please get out of the way.
I'm gonna arrest her this time.

22:16.654 --> 22:18.822
Before you do anything,
we need to talk.

22:34.939 --> 22:37.507
You sure you want to do this?

22:37.575 --> 22:40.110
You know better than
to question me, Miss Walker.

22:40.177 --> 22:41.744
I need to know what
she told her father,

22:41.812 --> 22:44.480
and what she intends
to tell him.

22:44.548 --> 22:46.482
Would you like
to stick around?

22:46.550 --> 22:47.984
See for yourself?

22:48.052 --> 22:49.652
No.

22:49.719 --> 22:51.687
I need to accelerate matters.
Deploy grenades tonight.

22:51.754 --> 22:54.690
She spooked you.

22:54.758 --> 22:56.992
And she was always
the one you trusted the most.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.732
She made me doubt.
We can't have that.

23:41.867 --> 23:47.072
It's been a while, Dani.

23:47.140 --> 23:50.375
We're not so different,
are we?

23:50.443 --> 23:55.148
We both feel
what other people feel.

23:56.884 --> 23:58.485
Do you ever hurt them?

23:58.552 --> 24:02.089
The ones you touch?

24:02.260 --> 24:04.796
All the time.

24:06.298 --> 24:09.400
Cam!
Dani!

24:09.468 --> 24:13.904
Agnes, don't.

24:13.972 --> 24:17.441
You're here to rescue her?

24:17.509 --> 24:20.878
I love her.

24:20.945 --> 24:23.480
How did you do it?

24:23.547 --> 24:25.515
How did I not see?

24:25.583 --> 24:26.816
Cam.

24:26.884 --> 24:29.118
I can still scream for help.

24:29.186 --> 24:31.588
I need to know.

24:31.655 --> 24:35.292
Please. Please.

24:40.866 --> 24:42.400
I don't want to talk to him.

24:42.467 --> 24:44.002
Cameron, you're gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

24:44.069 --> 24:45.136
This isn't about you and me.

24:45.204 --> 24:47.539
It's about Dani.

24:47.606 --> 24:48.907
We figured out
a way to save her.

24:48.975 --> 24:50.909
But we need your help.
With this adenosine

24:50.977 --> 24:52.244
and the other inhibitors,

24:52.311 --> 24:54.078
and some careful pushes
from Nina,

24:54.146 --> 24:56.147
you should be able to resist
any sort of probe.

24:56.215 --> 24:57.348
Cam...

24:57.416 --> 25:01.119
you're sure you want to do this?
Ready.

25:01.186 --> 25:03.054
Find Dani.

25:09.962 --> 25:12.196
Find Dani.

25:12.264 --> 25:13.598
Whatever it takes.

25:13.665 --> 25:15.600
Whatever it takes.

25:15.667 --> 25:19.170
Gah!

25:19.238 --> 25:22.373
You did all that...

25:22.441 --> 25:26.978
For her?

25:32.217 --> 25:33.517
I'll give you ten minutes.

25:33.585 --> 25:36.053
Come on.
Let's go.

25:43.228 --> 25:45.663
Okay, come on.
Come on, move.

25:45.731 --> 25:47.364
Where are we going?
What's next?

25:47.432 --> 25:48.866
No, that's done, okay?

25:48.934 --> 25:50.634
Your father should have never
sent you back to Parish.

25:50.702 --> 25:51.902
Now, we're getting
out of here.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.136
No. I didn't come back here
for my father.

25:53.204 --> 25:54.671
- Dani--
- No, Cam!

25:54.739 --> 25:56.706
I'm a junkie and a liar.

25:56.774 --> 25:58.642
This is my chance
to do something good.

25:58.709 --> 26:00.110
Parish is planning something

26:00.177 --> 26:01.511
that's gonna kill
a lot of people.

26:01.579 --> 26:03.647
I can't walk away.
I won't.

26:03.715 --> 26:04.848
Do you know where Parish
is right now?

26:04.916 --> 26:07.050
Did you find anything out?

26:07.118 --> 26:08.418
He had me take these grenades

26:08.486 --> 26:12.189
that weaponize
electrical current.

26:12.256 --> 26:13.657
It sounds like
he's gonna deploy them tonight.

26:13.725 --> 26:15.593
I heard one of
his guys saying something

26:15.661 --> 26:17.695
about a--a shipping depot
or something.

26:17.763 --> 26:19.397
Shipping.

26:19.465 --> 26:21.699
Parish has a shipping company
in Weehawken.

26:21.767 --> 26:24.535
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

26:36.615 --> 26:38.616
Hello?

26:38.684 --> 26:40.385
Oh, Dani.

26:40.452 --> 26:44.722
Oh, thank God.

26:44.790 --> 26:46.591
You should all know
that she's alive.

26:46.659 --> 26:47.992
Dani is alive.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.694
Cameron saved her.
Yay.

26:50.762 --> 26:52.997
That's good news.
Yeah.

26:53.065 --> 26:55.099
However, Parish's people
are apparently assembling

26:55.167 --> 26:56.400
some sort of device,

26:56.468 --> 26:59.003
using the grenades,
all of them.

26:59.071 --> 27:00.472
Wire enough of those
together,

27:00.539 --> 27:01.640
set them off
at the right point

27:01.707 --> 27:04.242
in the power system, and...

27:04.310 --> 27:06.078
the main line
will carry the blast

27:06.145 --> 27:08.580
straight into Manhattan.

27:08.648 --> 27:10.850
A million people could die.

27:18.125 --> 27:21.294
Tell me what you see,
Eddie.

27:21.361 --> 27:23.029
A lot of heat in Newark

27:23.097 --> 27:25.865
and the main Jersey
central lines.

27:25.933 --> 27:27.267
Look at that.

27:27.335 --> 27:29.969
The concert going on at
the Meadowlands is glowing.

27:30.037 --> 27:32.471
Focus down.

27:32.539 --> 27:34.773
We need to find
the most active power conduit

27:34.841 --> 27:38.610
leading into the city.

27:38.678 --> 27:41.680
Con Ed 23.
Jersey Central, 1A3.

27:41.748 --> 27:44.950
It's a straight shot
into Manhattan.

27:45.018 --> 27:47.085
You hear that, Mr. Scipio?

27:47.153 --> 27:48.954
1A3.

27:49.022 --> 27:51.657
Got it.

27:53.859 --> 27:55.093
We got our target.

27:55.161 --> 27:56.928
- Sweet.
- Are you ready for this?

27:56.996 --> 28:00.032
Yeah.

28:02.068 --> 28:05.404
Oof!

28:08.675 --> 28:11.210
Ah! Oh, oh!

28:11.278 --> 28:14.013
Ah!

28:17.651 --> 28:19.619
Cam!
Cam, look out!

28:19.687 --> 28:21.789
Bad ninja!

28:21.856 --> 28:26.294
Cam! Aah!

28:34.470 --> 28:37.605
Unh!

28:40.008 --> 28:44.478
Dani!

28:44.546 --> 28:46.180
- Let her go!
- Oh-ho!

28:46.247 --> 28:47.981
Don't go anywhere.

28:48.049 --> 28:49.349
Hey, someone wants
to talk to you.

28:50.785 --> 28:53.787
Hey, Kimi!

28:57.525 --> 28:59.960
Oh!

29:00.028 --> 29:01.562
Dani!

29:01.629 --> 29:04.665
Shhhhh.

29:04.732 --> 29:06.867
No, no, Cam.
Cam, look at me!

29:06.935 --> 29:09.603
Don't listen to her!
Cam!

29:11.539 --> 29:12.806
Cam! Look at me!

29:12.874 --> 29:15.042
Look at me!
Don't listen!

29:15.110 --> 29:16.944
Cam!

29:24.419 --> 29:27.254
Come here, you.

29:31.226 --> 29:32.960
No, no, no, no, no, no. Cam,
Cam, no!

29:33.028 --> 29:36.431
Put it down,
put it down!

29:36.499 --> 29:38.132
Put it down, baby.

29:45.798 --> 29:46.965
Cam.
Cam, look at me.

29:47.033 --> 29:48.700
Look at me.
You don't want to do this.

29:48.768 --> 29:51.870
Cam!

29:51.938 --> 29:52.937
What's up?

29:53.005 --> 29:55.206
Oof!

29:55.274 --> 29:58.175
Oh.

29:58.243 --> 29:59.210
Hicks?

29:59.278 --> 30:01.479
Nina! Help!

30:01.546 --> 30:04.148
Unh.

30:04.216 --> 30:06.083
Hicks! Come on.

30:06.151 --> 30:07.985
Hicks, whatever she said,

30:08.053 --> 30:08.953
forget it--you don't want
to hurt yourself.

30:09.021 --> 30:10.555
Put that down.

30:14.660 --> 30:16.894
Hey, you all right?

30:16.962 --> 30:18.263
I'm okay.

30:18.330 --> 30:20.098
Oh, this has
all gone so wrong.

30:20.165 --> 30:21.132
I'm sorry.
We've gotta get you out of here.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.834
Where are the grenades?

30:22.902 --> 30:24.670
Ah. Where's Scipio?

30:28.608 --> 30:30.342
- I got this.
- Dani!

30:30.409 --> 30:34.112
- Come on!
- I can't let him go alone.

30:38.117 --> 30:39.217
Dani.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.719
We've been over this.
Go.

30:52.498 --> 30:54.366
Almost there.

31:20.694 --> 31:23.028
Gary, where's the truck
headed, where's the target?

31:23.096 --> 31:24.463
Gary, look for the lines

31:24.531 --> 31:25.998
carrying the most power
into New York.

31:26.066 --> 31:27.466
They would have
the biggest impact.

31:27.534 --> 31:29.335
Well, yeah, I'm trying,
I'm trying.

31:29.402 --> 31:31.136
You gotta try harder, Gary.
Come on, partner.

31:31.204 --> 31:32.904
Bill, I'm doing my best,
come on.

31:38.878 --> 31:40.712
Get off.

31:53.358 --> 31:55.959
Cam!

32:02.434 --> 32:03.801
Unh.

32:23.354 --> 32:25.522
Crash.
Hicks made him crash.

32:25.590 --> 32:27.057
What?

32:27.125 --> 32:28.892
Yeah,
on Hackensack Plank Road.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.594
- All right, hurry,
- Okay.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.209
Hey...

32:51.015 --> 32:53.917
Thanks for coming to get me.

32:53.984 --> 32:55.552
What else could I do?

32:55.620 --> 32:58.322
Come on.

32:58.389 --> 33:03.327
Hey, give me your phone.

33:07.233 --> 33:10.669
Damn it.

33:10.737 --> 33:12.505
Hey, this is Hicks.
Look, I stopped the truck,

33:12.572 --> 33:14.540
but Scipio got away.
All right, copy.

33:14.608 --> 33:17.376
Gary, are you with me?

33:17.444 --> 33:19.145
Oh, no.
I'm at the office, Bill.

33:19.212 --> 33:20.479
You're in New Jersey.

33:20.547 --> 33:23.115
Send the DOD
to the crash site now, okay?

33:23.183 --> 33:24.416
Anybody else who's around.

33:24.484 --> 33:26.418
Oh, wait.
I think I found the target.

33:26.486 --> 33:27.719
They're there, Bill.

33:27.787 --> 33:28.987
Dani and Hicks.

33:29.055 --> 33:31.122
What? What are
you talking about?

33:31.190 --> 33:34.825
They're right there.
They're at the target.

33:34.893 --> 33:37.061
The crash site is the target.

33:37.129 --> 33:38.763
It's here.

33:38.831 --> 33:40.932
They're planning on setting
it off here.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.200
Looks like they turned
the grenades

33:42.268 --> 33:44.870
into some kind of I.E.D.

33:44.937 --> 33:46.538
It's got multiple
redundant wires.

33:46.606 --> 33:49.041
Hicks, you're lucky it didn't
blow up when it crashed.

33:49.109 --> 33:50.309
It's got a remote trigger.

33:50.377 --> 33:52.445
Listen, Gary.
Send the bomb squad right away.

33:52.513 --> 33:54.314
Fire, rescue, everybody.

33:54.382 --> 33:55.815
The bomb squad's driving
to you right now,

33:55.883 --> 33:58.017
but there was an accident
on the George Washington Bridge.

33:58.085 --> 33:59.919
They're gonna be 15 minutes
getting to you.

33:59.987 --> 34:01.687
No, there's no time!

34:01.755 --> 34:02.855
Look, Gary, what
if we could disarm it?

34:02.923 --> 34:04.056
You know, you could talk
us through it.

34:04.124 --> 34:05.457
Find some kind
of database or something.

34:05.525 --> 34:07.059
No, I can't.
I'm busy.

34:07.126 --> 34:08.594
I only have two hands.

34:08.661 --> 34:09.828
Busy doing what?

34:09.896 --> 34:12.063
I'm saving the world, Bill.
Come on.

34:12.130 --> 34:13.797
I'm using the phone
that Skylar gave me

34:13.866 --> 34:15.933
to access the power company
computers.

34:16.001 --> 34:17.869
'Cause it's the electricity
that kills people,

34:17.937 --> 34:19.670
so if I can just reroute
the power--

34:19.739 --> 34:21.505
That might actually stop
the chain reaction.

34:21.574 --> 34:23.174
Gary,
how long will that take?

34:23.242 --> 34:25.944
It's gonna take a while.
This is very difficult.

34:26.012 --> 34:28.414
You couldn't do this.
Damn it.

34:28.481 --> 34:31.217
Parish could set this
off whenever he wants.

34:31.284 --> 34:33.585
We need time.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.821
I can get you time.

34:35.889 --> 34:39.824
Give me the phone.

34:39.893 --> 34:42.495
Trust me.

34:47.234 --> 34:51.570
All right.

34:51.638 --> 34:55.808
No. No, no, no.
He can't see you.

34:55.875 --> 34:59.344
I got this.

35:17.062 --> 35:18.162
Miss Walker.

35:18.230 --> 35:21.532
Hello, Stanton.

35:25.571 --> 35:26.604
Danielle.

35:26.672 --> 35:29.107
To what do I owe the pleasure?

35:29.175 --> 35:33.545
Take a look.

35:33.613 --> 35:37.783
I'm standing on top
of your bomb.

35:37.851 --> 35:40.819
If you really care about me...

35:40.887 --> 35:43.155
If I ever meant anything
to you at all, just...

35:43.223 --> 35:44.790
let this go.

35:44.858 --> 35:47.192
Dani, you're not supposed
to be there.

35:47.260 --> 35:48.327
Please step away.

35:48.395 --> 35:50.963
I can't do that.

35:51.031 --> 35:53.400
I can't let
you kill millions of people.

35:53.467 --> 35:55.502
We've already
been through this.

35:55.569 --> 35:57.103
You understand what's at stake.

35:57.171 --> 35:59.606
Just because you've believed
something for a long time

35:59.674 --> 36:03.209
doesn't make it true.

36:06.513 --> 36:09.349
There's something happening
in the grid.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.117
Lines are shutting down.

36:11.185 --> 36:13.920
Now would be a good time.

36:13.988 --> 36:17.090
What if you're wrong?

36:17.157 --> 36:19.625
What if there's a way
to make the world better

36:19.693 --> 36:20.960
without killing anyone?

36:21.027 --> 36:25.530
Danielle...

36:25.598 --> 36:29.434
I wish that were true.

36:29.502 --> 36:30.568
I don't want to hurt you.

36:30.636 --> 36:32.437
Please don't make me do this.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.607
[Car approaching

36:38.610 --> 36:41.413
Dani, get out of there!

36:41.480 --> 36:43.615
What are you doing?
Why are you stopping me?

36:43.683 --> 36:45.917
- She's buying us some time.
- What?

36:50.356 --> 36:53.158
Stanton...

36:53.226 --> 36:56.595
you taught me
to stand for my principles.

36:56.663 --> 36:59.097
You taught me that sometimes,

36:59.165 --> 37:03.402
sacrifices need to be made.

37:03.469 --> 37:07.372
I listened.

37:07.439 --> 37:10.441
My sweet Danielle.

37:10.509 --> 37:12.644
Fighting for what
she believes in.

37:12.711 --> 37:16.080
You are more

37:16.148 --> 37:17.649
than I ever could have
hoped for.

37:24.456 --> 37:28.893
I am so proud of you.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.295
You will always be remembered.

37:36.401 --> 37:37.501
Run!

37:37.569 --> 37:39.437
Dani! Dani!

37:45.510 --> 37:46.944
Aah!

38:00.145 --> 38:02.546
Oh! The lights are still on.
I did it!

38:02.614 --> 38:03.881
I diverted the power.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.416
We stopped Parish.
We won!

38:05.484 --> 38:06.951
Wait--oh, no.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.186
You can't hear me,
'cause your phone went out.

38:09.254 --> 38:11.288
Everyone else
can hear me, though.

38:11.356 --> 38:14.358
Hey! We saved New York!
We won!

38:14.425 --> 38:17.661
Everyone...

38:17.729 --> 38:19.630
Lorenzo, we won.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.532
Lorenzo!

38:30.075 --> 38:32.877
The lights are still on.
It didn't work.

38:32.945 --> 38:37.181
No.

38:37.249 --> 38:39.316
It did what we needed.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.822
It has begun.

38:47.926 --> 38:51.629
Unh.

38:51.697 --> 38:52.830
Ohh.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.873
Is everyone all right?
Rachel?

39:03.941 --> 39:05.742
I'm okay.

39:05.809 --> 39:08.878
- Bill?
- I'll get there.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.280
Go look on the others.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.183
Where's--

39:15.654 --> 39:17.688
Dani.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.494
Dani!

39:22.561 --> 39:26.632
Dani. Dani?

39:26.699 --> 39:28.700
Oh, God.

39:28.768 --> 39:31.069
Dani?
Dani, come here.

39:31.137 --> 39:34.206
Oh.

39:34.273 --> 39:36.575
Dani?
Dani, it's daddy.

39:36.643 --> 39:37.876
It's daddy.
Can you hear me?

39:40.013 --> 39:41.680
Daddy.

39:41.748 --> 39:43.616
What? I'm here.

39:43.683 --> 39:45.551
Daddy, I'm thirsty.

39:45.618 --> 39:49.288
Wait. Oh.

39:54.495 --> 39:55.629
Dani.

39:55.696 --> 39:56.997
Dani, look at me.

39:57.065 --> 39:59.032
Look at me.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.167
Dani, I love you.

40:00.235 --> 40:03.037
I love you so very much.

40:03.105 --> 40:06.207
Please, please stay with me.

40:06.275 --> 40:07.842
Please, Dani.

40:14.016 --> 40:17.085
Cameron!

40:17.153 --> 40:19.354
Look at me.

40:19.422 --> 40:22.524
Don't go.

40:22.592 --> 40:23.758
Cameron, she's...

40:28.163 --> 40:32.267
Can't somebody
do something?

40:32.334 --> 40:35.036
Nina! Nina!

40:35.104 --> 40:38.607
Do something, please.

40:38.675 --> 40:41.310
Dani?

40:41.378 --> 40:44.981
Dani, look at me.

40:45.049 --> 40:48.884
Do not die.

40:48.952 --> 40:51.220
Okay, just stay with us.

40:51.288 --> 40:55.358
Do not die.

41:05.937 --> 41:10.374
No.

41:10.442 --> 41:13.111
