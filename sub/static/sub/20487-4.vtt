current reality

05:25.033 --> 05:27.400
is all too often.

05:27.433 --> 05:29.167
Now, generally speaking,

05:29.200 --> 05:32.333
to open up a cart on the street,
you need a license?

05:32.367 --> 05:34.567
You have to have a license
for yourself,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.900
and then you have to have
a permit for the cart itself.

05:36.933 --> 05:37.967
That's the problem.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.167
And any spot?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.367
Generally speaking, yes,

05:40.400 --> 05:41.967

Manhattan, in my view,

"cleaning up" Roosevelt Avenue.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.900
You know what that means.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.233
If you get higher rent,
nicer buildings,

06:10.267 --> 06:12.700
they're not gonna want
a street cart out in front.

06:12.733 --> 06:14.493

that vendors face.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.400
Even if the spot
is completely legal,

06:16.433 --> 06:19.400
and we see it all the time,
where there's building managers

06:19.433 --> 06:20.726

"Hey, you know,

06:20.733 --> 06:21.826

Oh, they put me in the outfield.

25:49.067 --> 25:50.033
I was terrible.

25:50.067 --> 25:51.700
Which outfield?
That matters.

25:51.733 --> 25:53.467
Oh, yeah,
usually the right side or...

25:53.500 --> 25:54.693
- Right field?
- What do they call it?

26:15.833 --> 26:19.367
Mr. President, I know you're not
too good at listening.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.667

than you do.

26:39.533 --> 26:40.900

26:40.933 --> 26:44.467

of what I think is right

26:44.500 --> 26:45.900

26:45.933 --> 26:48.567

Dude, we have to organize.

26:54.667 --> 26:55.967
There's no other way to do it.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.833
America wouldn't be
as great as it is right now

26:57.867 --> 26:59.367
if people didn't organize.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.867
It's both unique and disturbing
that you're also from Queens.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.333
Because the values
that you have been running on

27:08.367 --> 27:11.833

we know.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.733

27:13.767 --> 27:17.567
we, all of us, will make sure

27:17.600 --> 27:20.067
you don't forget
where you came from.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.567
How much traction are you
getting within the community?

27:25.600 --> 27:29.667
Is there a hunger for that
or is it taking some convincing?

27:29.700 --> 27:31.900
There are definitely a lot of
people who are just...

27:31.933 --> 27:33.400
Because it's such
a new community,

27:33.433 --> 27:35.067

to make it in America.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.760

kind of came in,

30:31.733 --> 30:34.633
pitched in, brought food,
brought generators.

like, government,

What's going on?

31:01.867 --> 31:04.367

where the city

31:04.400 --> 31:07.000
and Robert Moses in particular

31:07.033 --> 31:09.967
really used as, like, a dumping
ground for undesirable groups

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
that the city didn't necessarily
want to deal with.

31:12.033 --> 31:14.200
Back in the day,
the Rockaways were

31:14.233 --> 31:16.867
a summer destination
for middle-class New Yorkers

31:16.900 --> 31:19.533
until better roads
and an improved rail system

31:19.567 --> 31:23.033
lured them to the beaches
of Long Island.

31:23.067 --> 31:26.033
They threw a bunch of
public housing projects in here.

31:26.067 --> 31:28.200
They sent a lot of the
low-income people of the city

31:28.233 --> 31:29.967
out here,
and it just wasn't a place

31:30.000 --> 31:32.333
that historically
the city ever took seriously.

31:32.367 --> 31:34.033
You know, since then,
we've always had

31:34.067 --> 31:36.533
a lot of working-class whites
move in,

31:36.567 --> 31:38.200
into more kind of
the western end,

31:38.233 --> 31:40.467
and so you've kind of seen
in the Rockaways

31:40.500 --> 31:43.567
just kind of shape out
along race and class lines.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.867
And the one dynamic
that's changed after Sandy

31:45.900 --> 31:48.367
was that a lot more, like,
young urban professional types,

31:48.400 --> 31:49.993
like, were really coming out
here, you know,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.367
maybe looking
intentionally or not

31:51.400 --> 31:53.567

Brooklynify the Rockaways.

31:53.600 --> 31:54.367
Right.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.900
Or gentrify the Rockaways.

31:55.933 --> 31:58.067
Rockaway's called,
like, the Brooklyn Riviera
