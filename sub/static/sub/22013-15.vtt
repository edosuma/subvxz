WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.686
Previously on Empire...

00:18.719 --> 00:19.987
ANDRE:
I left your name out of it.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.590
I wiped your slate clean.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.691
I'm gonna make a pitch
to the board.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.893
You want to be on top?
Back me up.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.895
You didn't think twice
about chucking your man here.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.064
You just signed
with the devil I know.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.600
-What about our music?
-Why can't we release it
under a different name?

00:32.633 --> 00:34.402
-Like start a band?
-A collective.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.705
Poundcake, I'm-a find your baby
girl and I'm-a bring her here.

00:37.738 --> 00:38.839
Please just stay away from me.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.374
'Cause I don't want to hear
from you

00:40.408 --> 00:42.176
or that woman in lockup ever.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.912
I suggest you sign this contract

00:44.945 --> 00:46.914
and then stay the hell away
from Empire.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.616
ANIKA:
I'm here because you want

00:48.649 --> 00:51.385
my help stealing
the company from the Lyons.

00:51.419 --> 00:55.123
Once we do, I'm gonna be CEO.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.527
Lucious, I'm telling you,
I don't feel like no trip.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.596
I don't want no planes,
trains, automobiles.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.532
Well, you ain't getting none
of that anyway.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.600
And I got enough diamonds
and-and gold-plated guns, too.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.136
Wait, wait, wait.
Raise your leg.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.970
Foot, foot, foot,
or you gonna trip on this step.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.639
COOKIE: I tell you,
if I fall in these heels,

01:11.672 --> 01:13.741
-I'm-a kick your ass.
-Okay, stand right there.

01:13.774 --> 01:17.044
Okay, now open your eyes.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.280
(piano music playing)

01:19.313 --> 01:21.149
What the hell is that?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.884
It's a prototype.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.621
Okay, so we barely got Eddie
out the door,

01:27.655 --> 01:29.290
20 For 20 is behind,

01:29.323 --> 01:31.992
and you playing watercolors up
in the lighting booth.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.061
-Look, honey,
this is what I see...
-(sighs)

01:34.094 --> 01:36.564
...when I hear music.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.900
It's one of the benefits that
you get from having synesthesia.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.503
Now, my thoughts are,
what if everybody

01:42.536 --> 01:44.505
that heard Empire's music,

01:44.538 --> 01:46.507
what if they experienced this?

01:46.540 --> 01:49.777
I'm thinking,
as a culmination for 20 For 20,

01:49.810 --> 01:52.513
I want to create a room
like this

01:52.546 --> 01:53.947
for every single album.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.584
I'm talking about a 360-degree

01:56.617 --> 01:59.987
sensory experience
that has mood,

02:00.020 --> 02:01.489
that has sound, that has color.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.924
I'm talking
about under one venue.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.593
I get it.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.529
You want the world to see
what goes on in our house.

02:08.562 --> 02:09.863
That's it.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.032
We'll-we'll call it, um...

02:12.065 --> 02:13.834
House Empire.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.036
Well, Lucious, I don't
really care what you call it,

02:16.069 --> 02:17.805
but we gonna have
to build 19 more of 'em,

02:17.838 --> 02:20.974
have them rigged for sound,
wired for electri...

02:21.008 --> 02:23.211
Look, that's gonna cost
too much money.

02:23.244 --> 02:27.047
Look, when-when I was at
my lowest point,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.717
when Empire was about to fail,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.785
you came up with 20 For 20.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.955
To save our fortune.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.226
Don't 20 For 20 deserve...

02:38.259 --> 02:40.294
deserve the best we got?

02:40.328 --> 02:42.896
Hmm?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.164
Our fortune.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.700
You need a mint.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.536
-Yeah, you had Chinese food.
-(chuckles)

02:48.569 --> 02:50.471
And you're not getting
in my drawers, Lucious.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.505
Nice try though.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.506
Not yet.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.041
(laughs)
Ouch.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.077
*

03:04.352 --> 03:05.919
ALL (whispering):
Surprise.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.088
(chuckles)
Why is everybody whispering?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.523
Because they don't want to...

03:09.557 --> 03:10.924
want to give you
another heart attack.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.861
Oh, shut up. Hi, baby.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.096
Mm! Hi. Aw.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.531
-Oh! Oh, I'm happy.
-Hey, Mama. I love you.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.768
I love you, too.
My firstborn. Mm.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.337
-(chuckles) Hey!
-Welcome back, boss lady.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.906
Thank you, Thirsty.
Hello, everyone.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.441
-Welcome back, boss.
-You're looking great, Cookie.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.343
Well, what is all of this?

03:29.377 --> 03:31.512
So, this is
from everybody, anybody.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.848
Gifts from Bey, Jay,
Mariah to Migos...

03:34.882 --> 03:36.350
COOKIE:
Okay, I'll tell you what.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.352
Why don't you start
a thank-you list.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.754
And-and, Porsha,
please don't get any

03:40.788 --> 03:43.023
of the gifts mixed up, okay?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
Yeah, she back.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.227
(chuckles)
The board is positively thrilled

03:47.261 --> 03:48.629
about your return, Cookie.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.965
Thank you, Edna.
Leonard, give the board my love.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.968
-Of course.
-LEONARD: We just want
to be certain you're ready.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.304
To come back, that is.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.105
COOKIE:
Oh, I'm 100% ready.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.207
Is there something wrong?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.443
-No.
-Just the timing of your return

04:02.476 --> 04:04.745
is a little... coincidental.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.246
-Mm.
-Especially after we

04:06.280 --> 04:08.081
just received Eddie Barker's
resignation letter.

04:08.115 --> 04:10.484
Oh, frankly,
we're just a little confused.

04:10.518 --> 04:14.254
Okay. Well, then let me
demystify your confusion.

04:14.288 --> 04:17.257
Eddie's done, okay? He's
finished with Tiana's project,

04:17.291 --> 04:20.461
so Lucious and I
are back in control.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.629
Of course. Of course.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.764
But Eddie brought
a certain sense of...

04:23.797 --> 04:25.499
-stability.
-What is that supposed

04:25.533 --> 04:27.267
-to mean, Leonard?
-LUCIOUS:
Look, no,

04:27.301 --> 04:29.269
we understand the need
for stability.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.672
That's why 20 For 20
is still on track.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.107
Actually, my first single
from that

04:34.141 --> 04:36.444
will be released
within 48 hours.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.911
-Really?
-Really.
-LUCIOUS: Yes.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.179
Well, we've kept it under wraps,

04:39.212 --> 04:41.081
but we've already begun
the implementation

04:41.114 --> 04:43.317
of a multimedia closing event

04:43.351 --> 04:45.919
that will rocket
Empire's streaming numbers

04:45.953 --> 04:48.188
into the stratosphere.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.161
(siren chirps)

04:54.194 --> 04:55.162
House Empire?

04:55.195 --> 04:56.096
Yes.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.698
-I like it, Ma.
-Mm-hmm.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.833
This is about to be
a game-changing event.

04:59.867 --> 05:03.003
This is an enormous undertaking
in a small window.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.638
I mean,
do-do we even have a budget?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.306
No. And we're not gonna
make one.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.142
Because if you say eight figures
to the board, they run.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.811
Yeah, maybe for good reason, Ma.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.481
No, Andre.
See, that's where you come in.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.483
You speak the board's language.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.984
So I'm gonna need you
to go out there

05:17.017 --> 05:19.487
and shore up their support.
Meanwhile,

05:19.520 --> 05:21.822
I will deal with everyone else
on the roster

05:21.855 --> 05:24.958
and make sure they know that
Empire hasn't forgotten them.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.326
You're on deck, right?

05:26.360 --> 05:28.161
I mean, I think
it's an amazing idea.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.863
It's-it's big, it's exciting.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.532
So that means you in?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.468
Um, are y'all in
on my new music?

05:34.502 --> 05:36.404
You still punkin' out
on the family.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.071
-You know what...
-I'm sorry.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.139
It's my fault. I didn't tell

05:39.172 --> 05:42.376
everybody Jamal
is his own brand now.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.712
Oh, well, yes. Thank you, boss.
(chuckles)

05:44.745 --> 05:47.147
Yo, y'all got jokes, man.
It's all good.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.882
Mom, I love you.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.585
I'm so happy that you're back,
you all healthy.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.154
And I support
y'all in whatever y'all do.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.724
And it would be so amazing
if y'all did the same for me.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.192
-So amazing!
-COOKIE: I'm gonna have
another heart attack

05:59.226 --> 06:01.361
dealing with you.
(sighs)

06:03.931 --> 06:05.733
Ah.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.768
(music swelling)

06:10.270 --> 06:12.272
Empire!

06:12.305 --> 06:14.875
* Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here to set it straight *

06:14.908 --> 06:17.945
* I make this paper, yeah,
it come to me, I never chase *

06:17.978 --> 06:20.548
* Hakeem the one to beat,
get at my rank *

06:20.581 --> 06:23.183
* I'm laughing at all these
jokes all the way to the bank *

06:23.216 --> 06:25.285
* 'Cause I got money to blow,
the closest you got *

06:25.318 --> 06:27.354
* Is a candle,
make a wish on the low *

06:27.387 --> 06:30.223
* So you can be half as dope
as this natural flow *

06:30.257 --> 06:31.592
* It's in my blood,
crackin' these thousands *

06:31.625 --> 06:33.393
* In my sleep, yeah, you know.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.628
-(music stops)
-HAKEEM: Wait, wait, wait.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.229
Whose name supposed to be
on this album?

06:36.263 --> 06:38.732
Yo, I thought we agreed.
I was gonna come in up top.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.934
-HAKEEM:
It's a matter of respect.
-Yo, I'm just doing it

06:40.968 --> 06:42.736
like I did
at the basement party, a'ight?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.805
That video's already got,
like, five million hits, yo.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.274
No disrespect,
but it's better this way.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.076
Shine, you've got to tell him,
man.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.245
-Yo, Kim and Khloe,
-(chuckling)

06:52.279 --> 06:54.247
you both are pretty, all right?

06:54.281 --> 06:57.250
Work it out. Make up your minds.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.753
LUCIOUS: These boys really
feeling themselves, huh?

06:59.787 --> 07:02.155
-Nothing we ain't seen before.
-Tell ya.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.592
What you doing down here?

07:04.625 --> 07:08.228
Starving for some inspiration
for this 20 For 20, man.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.063
And I need some quick.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.800
As soon as I get done
with this track,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.267
I got a wheelbarrow full
of beats for you.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.337
Well, truth be told,
I'm kind of liking

07:17.370 --> 07:18.472
this little girl right here.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.107
If you don't mind a few changes.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.109
Hmm. What you got in mind?

07:22.142 --> 07:23.944
Something personal.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.279
Um, you know, like, uh,

07:26.313 --> 07:28.482
how you spend your whole life
trying to get to the top

07:28.516 --> 07:30.684
of your mountain
and then somebody cut your legs

07:30.718 --> 07:32.119
right from underneath you.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.354
-(door opens)
-And somehow you get

07:34.387 --> 07:38.425
a vantage point
and you see clearly the past

07:38.458 --> 07:40.360
and your future...

07:40.393 --> 07:41.629
Hey, son.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.130
What's up, Pop?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.032
(sighs)
Change of plans.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.669
Looks like your daddy here
is gonna hijack this beat.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.270
-(chuckles)
-We need new lyrics.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.872
BLAKE: You're Lucious Lyon.
(chuckles)

07:51.905 --> 07:53.641
In person.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.475
(chuckles)

07:55.509 --> 07:57.978
Well, truth is,
I'm a fan of you.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.813
I've been watching you
through this glass

07:59.847 --> 08:02.816
and caught your demo
and that video.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.618
You got potential.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.988
You don't know
how-how much that means to me.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.223
You know what I'm thinking?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.560
Since this track
is about the future,

08:12.593 --> 08:15.796
why don't we throw baby boy
on-on it as an anchor.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.065
SHINE:
Mm.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.569
So brownnosing the king is
all you got to do to be top dog.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.004
Nah, he ain't brownnosing.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.472
He hungry.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.808
Roll your sleeves up, boys.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.677
We gonna show y'all
how to make a hit.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.278
Let's get it.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.382
Hey, what's up?
This is Tiana,

08:35.415 --> 08:37.350
the number one artist
in America.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.186
And whenever I'm in Dayton,

08:39.219 --> 08:42.723
I'm listening to the number one
station for hip-hop and R&B,

08:42.756 --> 08:45.926
Smokin' 95.4.
Was that cool?

08:45.959 --> 08:48.161
-A little more or do...
-Yeah.
-(door opens)

08:48.195 --> 08:50.063
Hey.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.333
So, how is
Empire's number one artist?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.835
Hmm?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.370
Can y'all clear the room
for a second?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.807
-Please.
-Sure.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.244
(indistinct chatter)

09:04.277 --> 09:05.913
(door closes)

09:05.946 --> 09:07.915
I was wondering
when you'd come in here.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.450
Where's Eddie?
And what the hell is going on?

09:10.483 --> 09:14.521
Look, Lucious and I have been in
this industry for over 20 years,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.758
and... Eddie fooled us.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.259
Okay?
But don't worry about that,

09:19.292 --> 09:21.294
-because he's gone now.
-He's gone?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.696
-Yes.
-Do you know what this means?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.197
This is my moment...

09:24.231 --> 09:26.634
I understand, sweetheart.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.036
I've been there with you
since the beginning.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.605
Through all the ups and downs.
Let's not forget that.

09:31.639 --> 09:35.776
Now, I know what Eddie did
for you is amazing.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.947
But you got to understand
that Eddie was bad for business.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.782
He got me results.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.251
And that's something
that you and Lucious never did.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.254
(chuckles)
You're a superstar, okay?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.822
There's no way around that.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.958
Cream always rises to the top.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.627
You were gonna get to this point
in your career with

09:53.661 --> 09:56.396
or without me,
Lucious, or Eddie.

09:56.429 --> 10:01.134
The mistake we made is that we
put you in the hands of, uh...

10:01.168 --> 10:04.337
not the best producer, okay?

10:04.371 --> 10:07.641
And I wasn't gonna stand by
and watch that man

10:07.675 --> 10:10.477
build you up
just to break you down.

10:10.510 --> 10:14.682
Now, I'm here to propose
that we make you

10:14.715 --> 10:18.351
the centerpiece for this
event launch that we're having.

10:18.385 --> 10:22.189
And that, my child,
is gonna keep you at number one.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
For years to come.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.960
And me and Lucious got you
on that.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.996
(sighs)

10:30.397 --> 10:33.366
Look, I got 30 more promos
to cut by noon.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.136
But... I'm so glad

10:36.169 --> 10:38.471
that you guys
are finally thinking about me.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.443
Hmm.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.878
*

10:44.912 --> 10:47.681
Let's do the next one.

10:47.715 --> 10:51.018
No, she's not expecting me,
but you can't call her?

10:51.051 --> 10:53.420
Maya?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.525
You say that you're doing this
for me, but I-I don't buy it.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.695
I-I don't really understand why
you're dredging up some convict

11:01.729 --> 11:03.964
out of your past, but I
don't need you to ruin my life.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.700
-That's not what I'm trying
to do, sweetie.
-Did you ever

11:06.734 --> 11:09.202
for one second think
that maybe I'm actually happy?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.371
That I have a wonderful family

11:11.404 --> 11:14.407
and, I don't know,
my life is just full.

11:14.441 --> 11:15.976
Did you ever think
for one second

11:16.009 --> 11:18.311
that maybe
you would get something

11:18.345 --> 11:21.514
from learning about who you are,
where you come from?

11:21.548 --> 11:23.851
Oh, wait.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.020
You think that I don't know
who I am? Why?

11:27.054 --> 11:29.356
Because my mom isn't my blood?
Because she's white?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.024
I didn't say that.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.492
Look, I don't need
some tour guide.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.694
I know exactly who I am.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.998
Okay. Well,
don't do it for yourself.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.667
How about you do it
for a woman who is dying,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.170
who just happened
to give you life.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.672
I stopped owing her
the second she gave me up.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.374
You think Poundcake
doesn't love you

11:47.407 --> 11:48.909
because she wasn't there
for you?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.778
Why don't you open the letter
and read it?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.213
It is a love letter to you.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.282
She talks about how much
she loves you

11:55.315 --> 11:57.617
and how she spent
all of her life looking for you.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.087
Just... just read it.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.322
That's all you got to do,
just read it.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.026
I have a mom.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.596
Okay? And her name is Elizabeth,
not Poundcake.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.601
(sighs)

12:14.634 --> 12:16.036
-Bring it in.
-Cheers!

12:16.069 --> 12:17.704
-To freedom.
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

12:17.737 --> 12:19.973
(whoops, chuckles)

12:21.942 --> 12:24.544
Poundcake, why you
always looking over here?

12:24.577 --> 12:28.481
We ain't gonna never forget
how you did us dirty.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.417
Cookie gonna see her babies.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.285
-You ain't never gonna
see yours.
-Chyna,

12:32.319 --> 12:33.486
you don't have to go that far.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.722
-It's not necessary.
-Hell I don't.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.624
Finally, one of us
is getting up out this bitch.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.492
But you gonna stay out.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.261
Damn straight.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
So, Cookie,
you getting released?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.432
Yep. Counting down the hours.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.167
Well, that's good.
I-I know

12:47.200 --> 12:48.735
you'll be happy
to see your boys again.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.404
-Boys? More like men.
-Mmm? (chuckles)

12:51.438 --> 12:54.474
They taller than me.
I cannot wait to squeeze them.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.777
You know, Holloway,

12:57.811 --> 13:01.514
I never figured you
for a snitch. (scoffs)

13:01.548 --> 13:05.185
But I guess whatever it takes
to get out, right?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.054
I guess.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.195
Don't listen to him, Cookie.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.231
Whatever you did to get out,
you did right.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.568
CHYNA (echoes):
Sure know how to ruin a party.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.109
Look, you're all here
because you're the absolute best

13:29.142 --> 13:30.377
at what you do.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.479
But, apparently,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.181
y'all have also managed
to piss off

13:34.214 --> 13:36.716
some of the most powerful people
in the music industry.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.651
Y'all rolled up in here
with reputations

13:38.685 --> 13:40.187
-a mile long.
-AZAL: All right.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.122
I am so sorry
for interrupting your speech,

13:42.155 --> 13:43.991
but if you think bringing us
down is a way to start...

13:44.024 --> 13:46.059
You know what,
enough, Preacher.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.161
You know what I'm saying,
I'm talking about me, too.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.631
Shoot, I got baggage
longer than the damn TSA line

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
-at Kennedy.
-Yeah, and I got a whole lot

13:53.233 --> 13:54.567
of demons chasing me.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.070
But that doesn't matter,
you know?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.638
What happened yesterday

13:58.671 --> 14:00.673
or a week ago--
shoot, a-a year ago--

14:00.707 --> 14:02.142
none of that matters here today.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.410
It's mostly about the music.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.744
It's only about the music.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.146
And all of that foolishness

14:06.179 --> 14:07.547
that's been sitting
right here on our shoulders,

14:07.580 --> 14:08.982
it's not gonna weigh us down
anymore.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.650
And we're completely anonymous.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.485
No social media.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.922
No Twitter,
no Snapchat, no 'Gram.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.823
We're gonna let the music
speak for us.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.426
And not one person's voice--
not mine, not Tory's,

14:19.459 --> 14:21.761
not yours, no one's--
is more important than the next.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.431
We all make decisions
as a collective.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.765
Is that cool?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.435
Let's do this.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.602
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on, y'all.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.770
Let's get it.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.472
A'ight.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.276
All right, fellas, here we go.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.611
(music swells)

14:45.818 --> 14:46.920
SHINE:
Mm.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.721
I'm gonna need a minute.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.058
-Hey, fellas, take five.
-(music stops)

14:51.091 --> 14:52.559
Come on out.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.870
Eddie made contact.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.973
He wants a payout, or he's gonna
show the documents to the board.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.376
LUCIOUS:
He's a pig.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.811
THIRSTY: Yeah,
a pig who thinks he's got you.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.446
Well, what else we got?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.082
There's always that one option.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.249
No. No.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.651
With the year this family had,

15:18.685 --> 15:20.253
that is not an option.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.594
Do we have, um, cash on hand?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.496
Sure. I mean,
I can cobble it together.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.766
LUCIOUS:
Fine. I'll bend over.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.436
Pay him.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.704
THIRSTY:
Okeydokey.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.644
Sorry for the interruption.
Had to handle a little business.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.983
Everything all right?

15:50.017 --> 15:53.020
Yeah, it's nothing. Just some...

15:53.053 --> 15:55.488
legal stuff I got to deal with.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.390
Okay, I'm-a call them back in.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.361
You sure you cool?

16:02.895 --> 16:04.364
Yeah, man.
I told you, it's nothing.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.767
Just some stuff with Eddie.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.836
I thought you punted that guy.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.871
Me, too.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.143
It seems that he's, uh...

16:16.176 --> 16:18.545
threatening to go to the board

16:18.578 --> 16:23.383
and reveal my creative
accounting practices

16:23.416 --> 16:25.352
if I don't give him
a grip of change.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.688
Well, everybody keeps two sets
of books, Lucious.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.957
That's the American way.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.959
How much does Eddie want?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
Ten mil.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.736
Listen, what about Leonard?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.305
WOMAN: I've left
several messages for him.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.806
I do know
he has a business dinner

16:46.839 --> 16:49.142
-later tonight.
-Okay, call him back.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.311
Um, tell him I'm coming
to his office right now.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.880
WOMAN:
Will do, Mr. Lyon.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.388
Wait, that's Leonard.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.723
Where's he going?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.925
-He's ditching me. Pull over.
-Right here?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.727
Pull over.

17:12.899 --> 17:15.135
(SUV door opens, closes)

17:17.604 --> 17:19.072
Leonard.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.408
Andre, I'm sorry.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.577
Something came up suddenly.
We should reschedule.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.113
Why are you giving me the brush?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.714
Off the record?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.216
The board is very concerned

17:29.249 --> 17:30.750
about Eddie Barker's
sudden departure.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.951
Concerned?

17:31.984 --> 17:33.453
I'm sorry, Andre.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.823
I really am.
I've said too much already.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.929
Guess who been blowin' up
my phone?

17:42.962 --> 17:45.132
Balenciaga, Dior, Louis Vuitton.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.966
They want to design our wardrobe
for House Empire,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.235
and they for real
want to dress you.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.003
What you think? Sequins or fur?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.308
Girl, you know when I'm finally
gonna feel free?

17:55.342 --> 17:57.744
-CHYNA: When?
-When I slip that fur

17:57.777 --> 17:59.412
-back on my skin, girl.
-Ooh!

17:59.446 --> 18:02.615
When they locked me up,
I had on this leopard dress.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.816
Mm-hmm.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.818
-And this chinchilla. (whoops)
-Mm-hmm.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.620
Are you sure you're gonna still
be able to fit

18:07.654 --> 18:09.322
-after all these years?
-Bitch.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.890
-(both laugh)
-BURLESON: All right, ladies.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.660
You know the drill.
Up and face the wall.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.662
-Oh, come on.
-Are you serious?

18:15.695 --> 18:16.929
-Yeah.
-Did he stutter?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.198
Let's go.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.574
Whoa!

18:27.607 --> 18:30.610
Look at what we got here.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.078
-What's that?
-Well, it looks like dope

18:32.111 --> 18:33.646
-to me.
-I ain't never done no drugs

18:33.680 --> 18:36.015
since I've been in here.
I ain't no smackhead.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.350
Ah, such a shame.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.818
Day before an inmate
gets released,

18:38.851 --> 18:40.953
add five years to your stretch?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.256
-Yeah, what a coincidence.
-Hmm.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.824
You realize a new charge

18:44.857 --> 18:46.926
invalidates your release deal,
right?

18:46.959 --> 18:49.762
GUARD:
Hey, hey.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.631
That's mine.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.168
What's it doing in her bunk?

18:55.202 --> 18:57.704
I hid it 'cause I thought
she'd be gone by now.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.005
-That's mine.
-BURLESON: You're lying.

18:59.038 --> 18:59.972
-Get her out of here.
-GUARD: Come on.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.608
No, no. I ain't going nowhere.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.975
Hold on a sec.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.611
These are yours?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.145
That's what I said, isn't it?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.947
Put her in the hole.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.981
Come on.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.384
Just got lucky, Holloway.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.528
Okay, get design pitches
from all of them.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.996
And they better damn well
be free.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.033
And push my meetings.
I got something I need to do.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.501
But you got those House Empire
budget meetings.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.503
Have Becky sit in
on the meeting, child.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.340
And have her e-mail me
those numbers.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.975
Okay.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.845
* You can't touch me
or you gon' get burned *

19:38.878 --> 19:41.814
* I'm too hot, make a fire
look like an intern *

19:41.848 --> 19:44.517
* Ain't a liar,
it's best you make a U-turn *

19:44.551 --> 19:47.019
* 'Cause I flame, get them in
their feelin's like heartburn *

19:47.053 --> 19:48.221
* Stuck out like a sore thumb

19:48.255 --> 19:49.589
* Been in the streets

19:49.622 --> 19:51.324
* Thuggin' out for my income

19:51.358 --> 19:53.526
* Ain't no daddy to hold me down
but the kingdom *

19:53.560 --> 19:55.428
* Mama told me to pray

19:55.462 --> 19:58.064
* Get all your dreams done,
yeah *

19:58.097 --> 20:00.367
* Cocky, they call me Rocky,
champion, yeah *

20:00.400 --> 20:03.436
* I'm too high, just too fly,
got me light in the air *

20:03.470 --> 20:05.605
* Uh, never hear my moves,
I'm so silent it scares *

20:05.638 --> 20:07.039
* While I'm signing
with my feet *

20:07.073 --> 20:08.341
* Trying to point to the jet

20:08.375 --> 20:10.243
* Faithfully get this money

20:10.277 --> 20:12.745
* My hood never leave me lonely,
tattooed on my back, yeah *

20:12.779 --> 20:14.714
* I take 'em
to where I'm going *

20:14.747 --> 20:16.883
* The top is the only place
that I'm living at *

20:16.916 --> 20:18.618
* I go hard
for my city forever *

20:18.651 --> 20:21.120
* Runnin' to the bank like

20:21.153 --> 20:23.222
* Ain't got no worries,
I get this money *

20:23.256 --> 20:24.524
* Pockets heavy

20:24.557 --> 20:26.793
* Yeah, I'm going crazy

20:26.826 --> 20:29.429
* Yeah, with these honeys,
get more then Brody *

20:29.462 --> 20:31.264
* Drop 'em quick, yeah,
I'm running *

20:31.298 --> 20:32.699
* Running, running

20:32.732 --> 20:35.268
* Running, running,
running, running *

20:35.302 --> 20:38.371
* Running to the bank
cause I'm stuntin', stuntin' *

20:38.405 --> 20:40.407
* Stuntin', stuntin', stuntin'

20:40.440 --> 20:42.642
* Stuntin',
gotta get my ice tight *

20:42.675 --> 20:44.311
Man, these fools
about to throw hands.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.545
No, no, no, no, no. Let 'em...

20:45.578 --> 20:46.779
let 'em handle their business.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.615
Okay.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.750
A little friendly competition.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.819
Make them step their game up.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.621
Yeah, well, it's funny,
they actually remind me

20:54.654 --> 20:55.988
of you and me back in the day

20:56.022 --> 20:58.090
when, um, we used to be
in the booth

20:58.124 --> 20:59.659
-battling for the mic.
-(chuckles)

20:59.692 --> 21:02.629
You mean when I dusted your ass
on a regular basis?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.096
Oh, that's how you choose
to remember it.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.965
That's exactly
how I remember it.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.567
Look, when we were throwing
them parties

21:07.600 --> 21:10.069
in them cold-ass basements
in Philly,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.138
who wrote the illest rhymes?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.006
-Me.
-Come on, man.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.342
-(laughing)
-You...

21:15.375 --> 21:17.610
you know what,
you've always been

21:17.644 --> 21:19.779
the muscle
and-and the money, Shine.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.648
I mean, I was the music man.

21:21.681 --> 21:25.452
It didn't have to be that way.
It's...

21:25.485 --> 21:27.320
it's just how things turned out.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.022
Yeah, well,
we can rewrite history now.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.691
You know,
why don't you go in there

21:31.724 --> 21:34.861
and drop some wisdom
on that wax.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.329
What? Oh, come on, man.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.197
Hey, young guns.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.632
Shine, the big bad wolf,

21:39.666 --> 21:41.368
is about to come
and blow you all down

21:41.401 --> 21:42.802
and show you all how it's done.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.706
-Hell yeah. Come on, Shine.
-A'ight, Shine.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.475
All right.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.443
Look, just hit "record"
and stay out the way.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.978
LUCIOUS:
Done.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.180
* High step, hover the threat

21:54.213 --> 21:56.783
* Papua New Guinea, head hunt,
Russian roulette *

21:56.816 --> 21:59.285
* I'm Philip Morris
and Chuck Norris and King Tut *

21:59.318 --> 22:01.888
* You rollin' with kids
with keys to the kingdom *

22:01.921 --> 22:04.557
* Freedom, we do whatever
we want, we got it *

22:04.591 --> 22:07.960
* While you sittin' in silence
like Twenty One Pilots *

22:07.994 --> 22:09.962
* I'm addicted to violence,
we should form an alliance *

22:09.996 --> 22:11.798
* And call it Serial Killer

22:11.831 --> 22:14.834
* Cartel Capitalism,
send Shine to get 'em *

22:14.867 --> 22:16.636
* Commit 'em to the psyche ward,
they crazy *

22:16.669 --> 22:18.471
* Actin' like they want war

22:18.505 --> 22:20.206
* The '80s is back
when it come to that *

22:20.239 --> 22:22.642
* Broad daylight,
this ain't no Call of Duty *

22:22.675 --> 22:23.810
* No regenerated life

22:23.843 --> 22:25.311
* Incinerate a body

22:25.344 --> 22:27.146
* Then I hide it
in plain sight *

22:27.179 --> 22:29.682
* I make the city riot, I can
give it the green light *

22:29.716 --> 22:31.350
* 'Cause I'm just
getting started *

22:31.384 --> 22:32.552
* 'Cause everything starts

22:32.585 --> 22:33.886
* In the heart of the artist

22:33.920 --> 22:36.088
* For my dearly departed.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.261
-BLAKE: Yeah, Shine!
-(clapping)

22:42.294 --> 22:43.663
Yeah!

22:43.696 --> 22:46.466
Like that. (laughs)

22:48.901 --> 22:50.903
*

23:07.754 --> 23:09.055
(music stops)

23:09.088 --> 23:10.389
Ah, she think she cute.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.191
-She think she cute!
-Do it, baby.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.693
She cute. She cute.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.127
She a'ight.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.029
Yo, let's take a damn ten or 15.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.364
I don't even care.
(mumbles)

23:18.397 --> 23:19.632
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah, take a break, guys.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.669
Hey.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.639
Oh, so you just gonna...?

23:36.348 --> 23:38.050
Becky, how the hell'd
you find me?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.953
I have spies everywhere.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.990
Is this why you've been ducking
and dodging my calls all day?

23:44.023 --> 23:46.292
Because you up in here
working on something

23:46.325 --> 23:48.461
other than your 20 For 20 album?
What is this?

23:50.663 --> 23:53.399
It's not for Empire.
It's-it's my stuff.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.734
Clearly.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.836
Look, Becky can you just
keep it on the low?

23:56.869 --> 23:58.605
Please?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.573
What am I supposed
to say to Cookie?

24:00.607 --> 24:03.576
That's my mom, man.
I-I'll handle her.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.812
Look, it's really important
to all of them,

24:05.845 --> 24:08.147
and-and it's-it's even
more important to me.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.317
So, please.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.492
I will keep this
between you and I.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.694
But only

24:21.728 --> 24:24.430
'cause when I walked in here
and I saw you jamming with them,

24:24.463 --> 24:27.299
you had a smile on your face
that I, frankly,

24:27.333 --> 24:29.536
have not seen since you used
to perform at the coffee shop.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.604
And I guess I miss it,

24:31.638 --> 24:33.039
-but you owe me.
-Yes, I do. So much.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.674
You owe me.
You owe me diamonds.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.442
-Diamonds and gold, son.
-Yes.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.677
Come on, gold shoes.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.311
-Come on, bun.
-You're welcome.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.947
Thank you.
I love you.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.949
Walk away. Ow!

24:42.982 --> 24:45.284
(giggling)

24:45.317 --> 24:47.319
See you later.

24:53.059 --> 24:56.796
-Hey.
-I really thought
I made myself clear.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.431
You did. And now it's time
for me to make myself clear.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.369
Look, baby,
I know you are scared

25:03.402 --> 25:05.471
because you have
all of these ideas

25:05.504 --> 25:08.240
of who you think
your mother was. A criminal.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.577
A jailbird. A nobody.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.880
I need you
to know her like I knew her.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.916
She's the reason
why I'm free today.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.885
Poundcake.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.920
POUNDCAKE:
Who's there?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.826
-Hey.
-Hey. How'd you get back here?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.828
I did 17 years, man.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.097
You think I can't pull no
strings up in this bitch?

25:31.130 --> 25:32.765
Wait a minute. Well, aren't you
supposed to be gone?

25:32.799 --> 25:35.201
Yeah, they about to process me
out, but before I leave,

25:35.234 --> 25:37.870
I-I... got to know the truth.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.272
When Burleson was tossing my
bunk, was those your drugs?

25:40.306 --> 25:42.274
Come on, now.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.176
Damn it!

25:44.210 --> 25:46.112
I knew it, that son of a bi...

25:46.145 --> 25:47.880
We need to tell somebody.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.016
No. 'Cause it's his word
against ours.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.584
I knew he was gonna try
to do something shady

25:51.618 --> 25:52.852
to keep you in here.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.454
But you in the hole now.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.890
Yeah, so what?
What difference does it make?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.859
Look, I've come to peace
with the fact

25:59.892 --> 26:02.094
that I probably
won't see my kid again.

26:02.128 --> 26:05.197
But you, you got a chance
to see yours.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.533
And I'm not gonna let that
scumbag take that away from you.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.468
Now listen, you just need
to leave this place

26:09.501 --> 26:11.804
and forget everything in it,
including me.

26:11.838 --> 26:15.041
No. Come here.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.209
I'll never forget you.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.878
It's all good.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.979
I owed you.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.748
And now I paid you back.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.585
Stay up.

26:30.289 --> 26:33.826
Poundcake sacrificed
everything for me.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.429
So it's true.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.231
She really didn't want
to give me up?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.834
No. She had a whole life planned
for you two.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.503
It's just... (sighs)

26:44.536 --> 26:46.172
(indistinct chatter)

26:46.205 --> 26:48.307
Why didn't my birth mother
want me?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.677
-Ah.
-That kept me up as a kid.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.444
But I was able
to put it behind me

26:52.478 --> 26:54.146
because I had convinced myself
that she was some convict

26:54.180 --> 26:55.347
I didn't want anything
to do with anyway.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.350
No. Poundcake was dreaming

26:58.384 --> 27:00.987
and making up all kinds
of stories about you.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.289
Ever since you were ripped out
of her arms.

27:05.491 --> 27:07.459
I don't even know her name.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.829
It's Sara Lee.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.365
That didn't really help.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.035
She's dying, Maya.

27:16.068 --> 27:20.472
And all she wants
is to see you.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.641
Please.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.978
Uh...

27:28.180 --> 27:30.316
O-Okay.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.853
* This ain't no Call of Duty

27:33.886 --> 27:35.121
* No regenerated life

27:35.154 --> 27:36.622
* Incinerate a body

27:36.655 --> 27:37.690
* Then I hide it
in plain sight *

27:37.724 --> 27:39.225
* I make the city riot

27:39.258 --> 27:40.827
* I can give it
the green light *

27:40.860 --> 27:42.194
* 'Cause I'm just
getting started *

27:42.228 --> 27:43.730
* 'Cause everything starts

27:43.763 --> 27:45.131
* In the heart of the artist

27:45.164 --> 27:48.634
* For my dearly departed.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.902
(Lucious and Shine chuckling)

27:49.936 --> 27:51.337
BLAKE:
Yo, for real, you took us

27:51.370 --> 27:52.638
to school on that one, man.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.073
You're like Mr. Miyagi
or something.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.142
Oh, yeah? Speaking of which,

27:56.175 --> 27:58.410
Mr. Miyagi...

27:58.444 --> 28:00.512
has some dry cleaning he needs
to get picked up.

28:00.546 --> 28:01.848
(Lucious and Hakeem laughing)

28:01.881 --> 28:03.215
Why don't you go handle that
for me?

28:03.249 --> 28:06.518
-(Blake sighs)
-Good looking out.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.256
LUCIOUS: I don't know why you
still sitting there, Keem.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.858
Now, you better wax on, wax off.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.159
Dad.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.593
Tell that
to the number one single

28:14.626 --> 28:16.195
I debuted at that
basement party.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.930
Anybody can have
a number one single.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.199
You better get out of here
before we make you walk

28:20.232 --> 28:22.534
-to Brooklyn and bring us
some cheesecake.
-(laughs)

28:22.568 --> 28:25.905
You trippin'.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.840
I don't believe this.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.508
Nah, you the one trippin'.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.210
-You better grow up.
-I'm out of here, man.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.445
LUCIOUS:
Do we have a choice?

28:33.479 --> 28:35.081
He's got some
serious growing up to do.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.116
Hey, boss,
can we talk for a sec?

28:37.149 --> 28:39.351
Look, anything you need

28:39.385 --> 28:41.587
to say around me,
you can say around Shine.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.455
He already know.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.392
Well, all righty.
(clears throat)

28:46.425 --> 28:48.928
So, I, uh, I got
the whereabouts on Eddie.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.230
His jet lands in a few hours.

28:51.263 --> 28:54.400
Do you want me to set up a meet?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.435
Since he's coming in on a jet,

28:56.468 --> 28:58.704
let's, um, make it the hangar.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.440
-He'll know which one.
-You sure?

29:03.275 --> 29:05.277
Can you believe I'm about
to pay this dude off?

29:05.311 --> 29:06.946
(scoffs)
Honestly? No.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.215
I can't.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.084
Look, I've known Lucious Lyon

29:12.118 --> 29:14.320
since I was knee-high
to a grasshopper.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.288
That Lucious--

29:16.322 --> 29:19.458
the one we was just reminiscing
about on wax--

29:19.491 --> 29:22.094
he don't pay nobody.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.301
You right.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.736
Okay, sounds like this
conversation is about

29:30.769 --> 29:32.571
to go left, so as your attorney,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.241
I'm going to excuse myself
to maintain deniability.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.976
I-I'll get on it.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.446
So what do you think? Um...

29:40.479 --> 29:44.016
This cat, he deserve the...
the Philly treatment?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.321
I'm not gonna tell you
how to handle your business.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.623
But this I do know:

29:51.657 --> 29:53.826
there's dudes you pay

29:53.860 --> 29:55.895
and there's dudes you end.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.466
What kind do you think Eddie is?

30:03.569 --> 30:07.639
As I recall,
his people are from Philly.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.844
So you know
how we gonna handle it?

30:11.878 --> 30:14.446
(exhales)

30:14.480 --> 30:17.116
Will you ride shotgun, man?
I could use a friend.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.218
Bet.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.358
Thanks, man.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.898
ANIKA:
Take note

30:31.931 --> 30:35.034
of the projected revenue
under our proposal.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.339
Now, of course,
I didn't just bring you here

30:40.372 --> 30:42.341
to impress you with our numbers.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.742
So why don't we hear
from Empire's

30:43.775 --> 30:46.345
number one asset herself?

30:46.378 --> 30:50.216
Eddie Barker is the reason
why I'm here today.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.719
I mean, topping three charts
all at once.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.321
That was all him.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.555
I'm impressed.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.856
But Eddie resigned.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.591
EDNA:
And, to be honest,

30:59.625 --> 31:02.594
there were concerns
about his multiple ex-wives

31:02.628 --> 31:04.897
-and messy finances.
-LEONARD: You were
the only one concerned

31:04.931 --> 31:07.533
-with his personal life, Edna.
-ANIKA: Now, unfortunately,

31:07.566 --> 31:11.170
the Lyon family coerced Eddie's
resignation, as they did mine.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.040
Now, Eddie is the only reason
why Empire is on the upswing,

31:14.073 --> 31:15.942
and I, as you all know,

31:15.975 --> 31:17.709
was the head of A&R during
the most profitable period

31:17.743 --> 31:19.178
of the company's history.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.747
So Eddie wants to stay on.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.182
Oh, absolutely.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.617
You need to reject his
resignation and reinstate him.

31:25.651 --> 31:29.555
Leadership has changed hands far
too many times for my comfort.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.224
ANIKA: I understand, Edna.
Believe me, I do.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.026
But any whiplash
that you might have felt

31:34.060 --> 31:35.861
has been completely
from the Lyons.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.630
Now, all respect that we have
for them aside,

31:38.664 --> 31:40.699
aren't you just a little tired

31:40.732 --> 31:43.902
of all the drama
that they consistently bring?

31:43.936 --> 31:45.904
I mean, Cookie destroyed
Empire's lobby

31:45.938 --> 31:47.706
with a baseball bat
for God's sakes.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.875
Now I am sorry,
but this is business.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.211
So are you willing to accept
this uncouth behavior

31:52.244 --> 31:53.879
for the sake
of just a few songs

31:53.912 --> 31:56.115
that barely crack the top ten?

31:56.148 --> 32:00.052
Listen,
I need Eddie Barker back.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.422
And... so does Empire.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.999
(monitor beeping)

32:17.436 --> 32:19.405
She's a little out of it,

32:19.438 --> 32:21.307
and she hasn't been able
to speak for a while.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.175
But I'm glad you're here.
She doesn't have much time

32:23.209 --> 32:25.811
before she transitions.

32:25.844 --> 32:27.946
-Thank you. Mm-hmm.
-Excuse me.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.019
Come on, don't be scared.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.886
It's okay.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.893
Hey.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.297
Hey.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.533
Cake?

32:49.568 --> 32:52.271
Hey, girl. It's Cook.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.107
It's Cook. I found her.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.475
I found your baby.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.044
-(Poundcake murmurs)
-Look.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.212
-She wants to meet you.
-Mm-hmm.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.348
Go ahead, say something.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.020
(voice breaking):
Hi. Um...

33:08.054 --> 33:11.123
I'm Maya.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.425
Cookie told me
so much about you.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.030
I just wish
I could have known you.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.765
Mm.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.002
(Maya sniffles)

33:24.036 --> 33:26.538
Oh. Here.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.342
-Is that the letter?
-Mm-hmm.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.949
(Cookie clears throat)

33:40.452 --> 33:42.388
"To my baby.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.424
"I don't know
if you will ever read this,

33:45.457 --> 33:47.526
"but if you do,

33:47.559 --> 33:50.696
"I just want you
to know some things.

33:50.729 --> 33:55.101
"I'll make a list
so I don't get emotional.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.169
"Number one:

33:57.203 --> 33:59.905
"If you hate onions,
you got that from me,

33:59.938 --> 34:01.940
because I do, too.
They give me gas."

34:01.973 --> 34:03.875
(laughs)

34:03.909 --> 34:05.911
(sniffles, laughs)

34:10.916 --> 34:13.285
Uh...

34:13.319 --> 34:16.021
Here, you-you
should read it.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.456
Go ahead.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.825
She should hear your voice.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.639
(sniffles)

34:33.672 --> 34:36.108
"Number two:

34:36.142 --> 34:40.146
"If you got a short temper,
that's me, too.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.047
"I'm sorry.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.484
"Just count to ten or 20.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.754
"Number three:
If you are reading this

34:48.787 --> 34:50.756
"at your college graduation,

34:50.789 --> 34:53.459
"dump whoever you're with.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.927
"Kick him, or her--

34:55.961 --> 34:58.630
(laughs)
"I ain't judging--

34:58.664 --> 35:02.301
-(laughs)
-"to the curb.

35:02.334 --> 35:06.138
"You can do better,
and you will.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.775
"Number four."

35:13.179 --> 35:15.013
It's okay, baby.
Go ahead.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.682
-It's okay.
-(sniffles)

35:16.715 --> 35:18.184
It's okay.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.751
"Number f..."

35:19.785 --> 35:21.086
(sighs)

35:21.119 --> 35:23.289
"Number four:

35:23.322 --> 35:27.493
"When you think of me,
and I hope you think of me,

35:27.526 --> 35:29.961
"because I think of you
every day,

35:31.630 --> 35:33.332
"please be forgiving.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.334
(Maya crying)

35:35.367 --> 35:37.703
"I never wanted to give you up.

35:37.736 --> 35:40.206
(sniffles)

35:42.541 --> 35:46.212
"And if you hear something
in the quiet moments,

35:46.245 --> 35:49.315
"and you're not sure
where it comes from,

35:49.348 --> 35:52.451
"it's me,

35:52.484 --> 35:55.221
"'cause I'm gonna find you.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.023
I'll be with you,
watching over you."

35:58.056 --> 35:59.491
Hmm.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.661
"I love you more than you...

36:02.694 --> 36:04.963
you could ever know."

36:04.996 --> 36:08.567
(crying)

36:08.600 --> 36:10.168
*

36:10.202 --> 36:11.903
(sniffles)

36:11.937 --> 36:15.774
(sobbing)

36:17.209 --> 36:18.677
-It's okay.
-(sobbing continues)

36:18.710 --> 36:21.112
It's okay.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.257
SHINE: So what's the plan?
You want me to keep watch

36:31.290 --> 36:32.758
once Eddie gets here?

36:32.791 --> 36:37.229
Well, I figured
we'd confront him together,

36:37.263 --> 36:40.599
teach him a thing
about manners and...

36:40.632 --> 36:42.368
loyalty, you know.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.903
Loyalty?

36:44.936 --> 36:46.705
Loyalty. (chuckles)

36:46.738 --> 36:48.340
It's amazing, you know.

36:48.374 --> 36:52.344
(laughing): You spend
your whole life around somebody.

36:52.378 --> 36:56.114
You go to birthday parties
with them, play ball with them.

36:56.147 --> 36:59.618
You even go
to holiday things with them.

36:59.651 --> 37:03.021
Spend hours upon hours
in the studio, making bangers.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.090
And the moment
you turn your head,

37:05.123 --> 37:07.225
they try and stab you
in the back.

37:07.259 --> 37:10.429
Turns out you never really
knew him at all.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.797
I guess this is why you got

37:11.830 --> 37:13.198
to always watch
who you got around you.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.867
(chuckling)
Ain't that the truth.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.404
-(laughs)
-You damn right about that, man.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.939
Look at this. Ooh.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.309
I mean, somebody be standing
right next to you

37:23.342 --> 37:26.077
after trying to kill you,
and smiling in your face

37:26.111 --> 37:27.846
like nothing
ain't never happened.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.688
There's no jet, is there?

37:39.958 --> 37:41.827
Eddie's not coming.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.995
(laughing):
Come on, Shine.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.933
How many chances have I given
you to tell me the truth?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.803
You've been setting me up
all day.

37:51.837 --> 37:56.842
No. You've been setting you up
all day.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.977
COOKIE:
Thirsty. Hello, everyone.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.647
I got confirmation.
It was Shine.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.850
He had Giuliana killed
to cover his tracks. I'm on it.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.218
Dilly dilly.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.591
How long have you known?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.660
I got confirmation this morning,

38:14.693 --> 38:17.329
but I've suspected
for a long time.

38:17.363 --> 38:22.534
When I saw you in my son Andre's
hospital room, what do...?

38:22.568 --> 38:25.837
Shine don't visit people
in the hospital.

38:25.871 --> 38:30.108
And you ear-hustling when
I'm in the booth with Cookie.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.644
Why does an innocent man
need to ear-hustle?

38:32.678 --> 38:36.515
Well, if you knew all this time,
why wait so long?

38:39.250 --> 38:41.720
I wanted to get you on wax.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.492
(yells)

38:48.427 --> 38:50.962
See, I got you
in the crossfire there.

38:50.996 --> 38:54.299
Don't shoot his ear off.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.301
See, now I know that track's
gonna be worth

38:56.334 --> 38:59.304
a whole lot of money.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.208
So what you...? You just gonna
kill me right here, huh?

39:03.241 --> 39:07.178
(laughing):
That was the plan.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.648
* I done make sacrifices

39:09.681 --> 39:11.550
* Aye, aye

39:11.583 --> 39:12.884
* So many sacrifices

39:12.918 --> 39:14.386
-(laughs)
-* Straight up

39:14.420 --> 39:16.488
* I done gave up
so much free time... *

39:16.522 --> 39:19.357
Man...

39:19.391 --> 39:21.527
I was just following
your son's playbook.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.161
* She know I make sacrifices

39:23.194 --> 39:25.030
'Cause he was too pathetic
to do it himself.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.498
* Then you make sacrifices

39:26.532 --> 39:28.266
All you Lyons are soft.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.602
You wouldn't last one day
in the streets anymore, Lucious.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.738
I knew that
the first time I saw you

39:32.771 --> 39:34.940
in one of them wack-ass ascots.

39:36.575 --> 39:39.745
And that's why
you played me all these years.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.848
'Cause I was better than you.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.250
Rhyming, hustling--

39:45.283 --> 39:46.818
I was always better than you!

39:52.458 --> 39:56.127
So no matter what
you do to me now...

39:56.161 --> 39:58.797
you got to live with that.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.232
* From sacrifices

40:01.266 --> 40:04.636
* Why can't y'all recognize

40:04.670 --> 40:06.972
* That we all came
from sacrifice *

40:11.076 --> 40:13.912
(laughs)

40:13.945 --> 40:18.316
