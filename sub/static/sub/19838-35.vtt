<b>They can't avenge them because</b>

00:03.620 --> 00:07.980
<b>they're too busy arguing over 
whether they're dead or mutated?</b>

00:08.910 --> 00:11.150
<b>Nothing's changed.</b>

00:11.150 --> 00:13.950
<b>They always lose sight of what's important.</b>

00:14.830 --> 00:16.990
<b>We're going to do things our way.</b>

00:17.570 --> 00:20.120
<b>If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.</b>

00:20.930 --> 00:22.120
<b>Don't worry.</b>

01:42.990 --> 01:48.000
<b>Carnage x And x Devastation</b>

<b>The Chimera Ant Zazan has 
built her nest in Meteor City.</b>

02:04.940 --> 02:08.890
<b>Calling herself the Queen, 
she seeks to conquer the world.</b>

02:09.360 --> 02:14.150
<b>The ones who have risen to quell her 
ambitions are inhabitants of this city...</b>

02:14.670 --> 02:16.440
<b>The Phantom Troupe.</b>

02:21.970 --> 02:23.870
<b>Where's everyone else?</b>

02:23.870 --> 02:27.160
<b>Beats me... 
Maybe still playing around?</b>

02:28.020 --> 02:33.030
<b>Rather than obliterating my opponent, 
I should have enjoyed myself...</b>

02:43.500 --> 02:45.930
<b><i>That took longer than expected...</i></b>

02:53.230 --> 02:54.730
<b><i>I should break my habit</i></b>

02:55.770 --> 02:58.760
<b><i>of beating my targets to a pulp.</i></b>

03:19.170 --> 03:21.170
<b>You're no match for me!</b>

03:21.170 --> 03:24.090
<b>Come back when you're stronger.</b>

03:24.980 --> 03:26.240
<b>Fair point.</b>

03:26.600 --> 03:29.640
<b>My, you took that well.</b>

03:30.230 --> 03:32.900
<b>Looks like I've lost my touch.</b>

03:34.800 --> 03:37.110
<b>But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.</b>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.920
<b><i>I'm stuck on defense...</i></b>

<b><i>He's fast, and has twice as many limbs.</i></b>

04:02.450 --> 04:04.050
<b><i>I need to create an opening.</i></b>

04:07.360 --> 04:08.770
<b><i>Again?</i></b>

04:08.770 --> 04:10.450
<b><i>Now I'm certain...</i></b>

04:10.450 --> 04:12.640
<b><i>The moment I think I'm rid of it,</i></b>

04:12.640 --> 04:16.080
<b><i>she pulls that vacuum cleaner 
out of nowhere again.</i></b>

04:16.080 --> 04:20.600
<b><i>Her power lets her pull out

04:20.600 --> 04:23.390
<b><i>I see... Very interesting...</i></b>

04:23.390 --> 04:27.160
<b><i>And I can't catch her with my sticky webs.</i></b>

04:27.160 --> 04:29.160
<b><i>This girl is good,</i></b>

04:29.160 --> 04:32.080
<b><i>but I can't let her get away.</i></b>

04:32.720 --> 04:37.610
<b><i>This technique is a literal pain in the ass.</i></b>

04:38.430 --> 04:41.590
<b><i>But I have no choice!</i></b>

<b>Radiating Love</b>

<b><i>Uh-oh, there may be no way out of this one...</i></b>

04:57.380 --> 05:01.530
<b>If I keep the webs coming, you can't escape...</b>

05:01.530 --> 05:03.240
<b>Lucky me!</b>

05:06.390 --> 05:08.490
<b>Caught you!</b>

05:13.160 --> 05:14.640
<b>It's no use...</b>

05:14.640 --> 05:21.000
<b>Even Bihorn-sama, strongest among us,

05:22.880 --> 05:24.010
<b>Now, then...</b>

05:24.010 --> 05:27.500
<b>I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.</b>

05:27.500 --> 05:31.920
<b>Will Zazan-sama praise me?</b>

05:32.680 --> 05:34.640
<b><i>It got lighter?</i></b>

05:34.640 --> 05:35.770
<b><i>Impossible—</i></b>

05:37.910 --> 05:40.650
<b><i>How?!</i></b>

05:41.150 --> 05:43.650
<b><i>How did she escape?</i></b>

05:51.840 --> 05:52.530
<b>Huh?</b>

05:54.090 --> 05:55.540
<b>I get it...</b>

05:57.000 --> 05:59.690
<b>You ditched your clothes.</b>

06:01.100 --> 06:02.540
<b><i>I understand.</i></b>

06:03.000 --> 06:07.790
<b><i>She widened an opening in my web to 
slip through, while protecting her skin.</i></b>

06:07.790 --> 06:10.300
<b><i>With her power, it's feasible.</i></b>

06:11.900 --> 06:14.560
<b><i>She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...</i></b>

06:15.220 --> 06:18.850
<b><i>But after escaping, she can make it 
disappear and call it to her again.</i></b>

06:19.960 --> 06:21.240
<b>However!</b>

06:21.240 --> 06:24.750
<b>Now that you've removed your clothes, 
you can't use the same trick again!</b>

06:24.750 --> 06:26.970
<b>The same applies to you.</b>

06:26.970 --> 06:31.200
<b>I've learned the range and speed of your webs.</b>

06:32.060 --> 06:36.450
<b><i>And I won't mention that his anus 
twitches twice before he fires.</i></b>

06:36.800 --> 06:39.460
<b>You won't catch me again. 
I'll keep my distance.</b>

06:40.200 --> 06:42.210
<b>Blinky and I have won.</b>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.450
<b>Won?</b>

06:46.080 --> 06:49.340
<b>Such a stupid girl...</b>

06:49.340 --> 06:53.120
<b>You can't do anything while running away.</b>

06:53.120 --> 06:55.130
<b>I said that I'll keep my distance,</b>

06:55.130 --> 06:56.720
<b>but I didn't say anything about running.</b>

06:59.150 --> 07:01.190
<b>I'll show you the difference.</b>

07:01.580 --> 07:02.620
<b>Blinky...</b>

07:03.580 --> 07:06.480
<b>Suck every last drop of blood from his body.</b>

07:11.040 --> 07:14.240
<b>What... Wh-Wh-What?</b>

07:21.410 --> 07:22.740
<b>Stop it!</b>

07:22.740 --> 07:23.700
<b>H-Hey...</b>

07:23.700 --> 07:24.750
<b>Y-You little...</b>

07:25.930 --> 07:27.850
<b>Weakling!</b>

07:31.780 --> 07:33.870
<b><i>Uh-oh, this is bad...</i></b>

07:33.870 --> 07:35.870
<b><i>I'm getting dizzy.</i></b>

07:35.870 --> 07:39.100
<b><i>I have to stop the blood loss!</i></b>

07:44.770 --> 07:46.400
<b>(How's that?)</b>

07:46.650 --> 07:50.150
<b>(Now you can't suck my blood...)</b>

07:51.900 --> 07:53.430
<b>There's more?</b>

07:53.430 --> 07:54.590
<b>From here?</b>

07:54.590 --> 07:56.040
<b>And here?</b>

07:59.870 --> 08:03.380
<b>I... I can't block everywhere!</b>

08:03.380 --> 08:07.430
<b>You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.</b>

08:07.430 --> 08:09.400
<b>Based on currently available information,</b>

08:09.400 --> 08:15.050
<b>it's impossible for you to cover 
each wound with your eight limbs...</b>

08:15.450 --> 08:17.200
<b>Not without another ace in the hole.</b>

08:38.140 --> 08:39.690
<b>All cleaned up.</b>

08:46.460 --> 08:47.170
<b>Huh?</b>

08:48.460 --> 08:49.880
<b>Hmm...</b>

08:55.910 --> 08:59.910
<b>Ah, you know those webs 
you were shooting out?</b>

08:59.910 --> 09:04.380
<b>By covering your body with them, 
couldn't you have stopped the bleeding?</b>

09:04.380 --> 09:06.380
<b>We're both pretty stupid...</b>

09:21.020 --> 09:24.000
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

09:29.590 --> 09:32.080
<b><i>How can they move so fast?</i></b>

09:32.080 --> 09:34.520
<b>Looks like he's moving a little better now.</b>

09:34.520 --> 09:37.760
<b>He has a ways to go before 
he's back to full strength.</b>

09:38.340 --> 09:41.710
<b><i>They were already here, enjoying the show.</i></b>

09:41.710 --> 09:46.520
<b><i>I wasted some time fooling around, 
but I was by no means slow...</i></b>

09:51.710 --> 09:52.840
<b><i>Five?</i></b>

09:52.840 --> 09:54.280
<b><i>No, seven?</i></b>

09:54.870 --> 09:56.530
<b><i>How many feints was that?</i></b>

10:00.990 --> 10:05.180
<b><i>And how can he leap from 
that position while attacki—</i></b>

10:05.180 --> 10:07.580
<b><i>Ah! He's already over there!</i></b>

10:17.380 --> 10:19.050
<b><i>I can't believe it...</i></b>

10:20.780 --> 10:24.020
<b><i>He's on a completely 
different level.</i></b>

10:29.340 --> 10:31.580
<b>Whoa, everyone's already here?</b>

10:33.720 --> 10:35.010
<b>Going for a new look?</b>

10:35.010 --> 10:36.820
<b>I got caught in my opponent's webs.</b>

10:37.130 --> 10:38.590
<b>Wait, you actually lost—</b>

10:38.590 --> 10:39.520
<b>I won.</b>

10:41.720 --> 10:43.430
<b>She's really mad!</b>

10:43.430 --> 10:45.200
<b>Feitan's the only one left.</b>

10:45.750 --> 10:47.550
<b>His opponent's pretty strong.</b>

10:47.550 --> 10:49.710
<b>It's probably the Queen.</b>

10:50.040 --> 10:52.560
<b>But Feitan looks sluggish.</b>

10:52.560 --> 10:54.620
<b>He isn't back to full strength yet...</b>

10:54.620 --> 10:56.710
<b><i>We know! You already said that!</i></b>

10:57.920 --> 11:01.200
<b><i>I'm still too weak.</i></b>

11:16.190 --> 11:17.440
<b><i>Behind me?</i></b>

11:22.650 --> 11:24.110
<b><i>What's with this guy?</i></b>

11:24.110 --> 11:26.110
<b><i>He keeps getting faster?</i></b>

11:26.110 --> 11:28.290
<b><i>And more of his buddies keep showing up.</i></b>

11:28.290 --> 11:31.050
<b><i>Curse those worthless idiots!</i></b>

11:31.050 --> 11:32.540
<b><i>All of them were defeated?!</i></b>

11:53.590 --> 11:55.150
<b>I didn't think your skin would be so tough.</b>

11:55.150 --> 11:56.150
<b>Cur...</b>

11:56.150 --> 11:58.280
<b>Curse you!</b>

11:58.280 --> 12:02.430
<b>How dare you damage my face?!</b>

12:31.410 --> 12:32.470
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

12:36.120 --> 12:37.110
<b><i>Ko!</i></b>

12:37.650 --> 12:39.390
<b><i>She left herself wide open.</i></b>

12:39.390 --> 12:42.700
<b><i>I'm not nice enough to overlook that.</i></b>

12:56.500 --> 12:58.890
<b>Her attack didn't hit him...</b>

12:58.890 --> 13:03.010
<b>No, she sent a little aura with that swing.</b>

13:03.010 --> 13:05.850
<b>Feitan's idea to use <i>Ko</i> backfired.</b>

13:06.200 --> 13:11.660
<b>After focusing his aura into one point, 
he didn't expect to deal no damage.</b>

13:12.090 --> 13:15.350
<b>The miscalculation left him a second 
late guarding with his <i>Nen.</i></b>

13:15.800 --> 13:18.910
<b>In other words, he was basically defenseless.</b>

13:18.910 --> 13:22.960
<b>A puny Emitter attack could 
have dealt serious damage.</b>

13:24.960 --> 13:28.020
<b>She knows how to use her aura.</b>

13:28.020 --> 13:30.370
<b>She has good reason to call herself Queen.</b>

13:32.710 --> 13:35.370
<b>This body has no weaknesses!</b>

13:35.770 --> 13:37.120
<b>Shouldn't we help him?</b>

13:37.460 --> 13:39.120
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

13:39.120 --> 13:41.120
<b>This is a race...</b>

13:41.120 --> 13:44.680
<b>If he loses, the next person gets to try.</b>

13:44.680 --> 13:46.040
<b>Who's up next?</b>

13:46.040 --> 13:47.280
<b>We use order of arrival.</b>

13:47.640 --> 13:48.850
<b>That's me, then.</b>

13:48.850 --> 13:50.040
<b>Wait...</b>

13:50.040 --> 13:52.260
<b>We both arrived at the same time.</b>

13:52.680 --> 13:57.170
<b>Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.</b>

13:57.170 --> 13:59.940
<b>Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.</b>

13:59.940 --> 14:01.940
<b><i>S-Something's...</i></b>

14:03.070 --> 14:05.030
<b><i>wrong with them!</i></b>

14:06.130 --> 14:07.340
<b>Heads.</b>

14:07.340 --> 14:10.620
<b>Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.</b>

14:11.000 --> 14:11.780
<b>Bah.</b>

14:12.680 --> 14:13.780
<b><i>I was naïve...</i></b>

14:14.530 --> 14:17.790
<b><i>I thought I could become 
number two in no time.</i></b>

14:20.500 --> 14:22.450
<b><i>But I'm utterly outclassed...</i></b>

14:22.970 --> 14:25.070
<b><i>It's hopeless.</i></b>

14:26.060 --> 14:28.180
<b><i>But I won't give up.</i></b>

14:28.950 --> 14:30.800
<b><i>I'm used to toughing it out.</i></b>

14:34.350 --> 14:38.550
<b><i>All for the sake of retrieving my brother, 
no matter how long it takes.</i></b>

14:41.390 --> 14:43.150
<b>There goes his left arm.</b>

14:44.800 --> 14:47.240
<b>Fei, wanna trade places?</b>

14:48.840 --> 14:50.160
<b>"Piece of crap..."</b>

14:54.140 --> 14:56.660
<b>"Know your place."</b>

14:56.660 --> 14:58.540
<b>Crap, run for it...</b>

14:59.310 --> 15:00.920
<b>You're gonna get caught in it.</b>

15:00.920 --> 15:05.090
<b>When he snaps, he'll hit 
everything around him!</b>

15:05.090 --> 15:08.670
<b>We tried to watch him once 
before and almost died.</b>

15:08.940 --> 15:11.240
<b>His power has a huge range,</b>

15:11.240 --> 15:14.400
<b>and activates with his anger, 
so it knows no restraint.</b>

15:14.400 --> 15:17.160
<b>If you get caught up in the 
one he's using this time,</b>

15:17.160 --> 15:18.680
<b>you're dead, Kalluto.</b>

15:19.580 --> 15:20.840
<b><i>This time?</i></b>

15:21.900 --> 15:24.000
<b><i>The attack has other forms?</i></b>

15:24.340 --> 15:26.000
<b><i>Darn, I want to see!</i></b>

15:46.490 --> 15:47.400
<b>What?</b>

15:55.620 --> 15:57.220
<b><i>When did he put that on?!</i></b>

15:57.770 --> 16:01.730
<b><i>Wait... More importantly, 
he's much stronger now!</i></b>

16:04.170 --> 16:05.980
<b>"Now I return your pain."</b>

16:09.250 --> 16:11.030
<b><i>Feel the heat...</i></b>

16:12.950 --> 16:16.490
<b>Pain Packer
Unforgiven</b>

16:13.500 --> 16:15.100
<b><i>Pain Packer!</i></b>

16:30.430 --> 16:32.050
<b><i>Rising Sun.</i></b>

16:32.010 --> 16:34.760
<b>Burnt by the Sun</b>

17:01.720 --> 17:02.810
<b>"Is it hot?"</b>

17:03.730 --> 17:06.560
<b>"Throat too scorched to even breathe?"</b>

17:07.480 --> 17:09.550
<b>"You could try to run."</b>

17:11.730 --> 17:13.820
<b>"Assuming you can even move..."</b>

17:14.990 --> 17:15.930
<b>"What's wrong?"</b>

17:16.490 --> 17:19.560
<b>"Make use of that tough body you're so proud of."</b>

17:25.780 --> 17:27.060
<b><i>Impossible...</i></b>

17:30.320 --> 17:33.070
<b><i>I am the Queen...</i></b>

17:33.460 --> 17:38.250
<b><i>I cannot die here...</i></b>

17:56.470 --> 17:58.470
<b>Out of fuel already?</b>

17:59.230 --> 18:01.630
<b>And the heat wasn't that strong...</b>

18:02.440 --> 18:04.000
<b>How unfortunate...</b>

18:04.470 --> 18:08.900
<b>You could have had a quicker death 
if you'd dealt me more damage.</b>

18:10.220 --> 18:13.010
<b>Well, you only have yourself to blame.</b>

18:38.980 --> 18:44.170
<b>They didn't revert after the Queen's death...</b>

18:44.170 --> 18:47.840
<b>But they're no longer under the Queen's control.</b>

18:51.230 --> 18:53.910
<b>Ple... ...me...</b>

18:54.980 --> 18:57.700
<b>Please... ki...</b>

19:04.380 --> 19:11.710
<b>Please... kill... me...</b>

19:17.150 --> 19:19.170
<b>Please...</b>

19:21.910 --> 19:24.640
<b>Kill us...</b>

19:29.470 --> 19:30.950
<b>Hell, no.</b>

19:31.810 --> 19:34.650
<b>I don't do mercy killings.</b>

19:34.650 --> 19:37.150
<b>Attack me, trash!</b>

19:41.440 --> 19:45.080
<b>You were living in this place, right?!</b>

19:45.330 --> 19:49.080
<b>Have the guts to defend it to the end!</b>

20:01.610 --> 20:04.650
<b>You can die with a bang!</b>

20:09.040 --> 20:10.400
<b>Now those geezers</b>

20:10.400 --> 20:16.230
<b>are arguing over whether to exact 
revenge upon the real queen.</b>

20:16.870 --> 20:19.830
<b>Man, I'm sick of those idiots.</b>

20:19.830 --> 20:24.990
<b>All they do is sit around a table, 
squawking about doing the impossible.</b>

20:25.410 --> 20:27.610
<b>But you're still sticking around, right?</b>

20:27.610 --> 20:30.250
<b>There's nothing else for me to do.</b>

20:31.430 --> 20:34.620
<b>If more Ants show up, 
I'll wipe them out at once.</b>

20:35.010 --> 20:38.000
<b>So I don't have to do any more cleanup.</b>

20:39.040 --> 20:40.000
<b>Is it the boss?!</b>

20:41.090 --> 20:42.960
<b>No, it's Nobunaga.</b>

20:43.310 --> 20:45.970
<b>He's asking if we'll help with his job.</b>

20:45.970 --> 20:47.530
<b>What was that?</b>

20:47.530 --> 20:50.020
<b>No way, fool!</b>

20:50.760 --> 20:52.890
<b>Man, this sucks.</b>

20:55.280 --> 20:57.650
<b>I hate having to wait.</b>

21:01.110 --> 21:05.400
<b>Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush.</b>

21:05.400 --> 21:06.910
<b>He's being very feminine.</b>

21:06.910 --> 21:07.620
<b>Eh?</b>

21:07.990 --> 21:10.270
<b>What was that, bastards?!</b>

21:10.270 --> 21:11.620
<b>Say that again...</b>

21:11.620 --> 21:12.660
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

21:12.960 --> 21:15.600
<b>Hey! We're hurt!</b>

21:18.170 --> 21:24.040
<b>The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor 
City from the Chimera Ant invasion.</b>

21:30.560 --> 21:32.090
<b>Meanwhile...</b>

21:34.040 --> 21:39.820
<b>Gon and Killua are preparing to 
infiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.</b>

21:43.510 --> 21:51.200
<b>The selection of citizens to present 
to the King by his own guards...</b>

21:53.520 --> 21:55.590
<b>...will begin in nine days.</b>

23:25.450 --> 23:27.590
<b>Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.</b>

23:27.900 --> 23:30.270
<b>Meleoron the Chameleon. 
Meleoron the Chameleon.</b>

23:30.270 --> 23:31.370
<b>Meleoron the Chaleleron!</b>

23:31.370 --> 23:32.510
<b>Meleoron the Chameleon...</b>

23:32.510 --> 23:34.240
<b>Meleoron the Chameleon!</b>
