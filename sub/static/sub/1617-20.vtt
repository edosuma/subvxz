I know. And I don't know how to be
with Laurel knowing the entire time...

36:25.920 --> 36:29.447
...that if she ever found out
who you really are...

36:31.000 --> 36:32.764
...she would choose you.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.610
Thank you for everything you tried to do
for Eric and Nancy.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.121
And for keeping Taylor safe.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.009
Come here.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.004
You keep being a good boy, okay?

37:12.600 --> 37:15.809
Tommy, I really need to talk to you.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.326
What's that for?

37:21.800 --> 37:23.040
It's my stuff.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.486
What's going on?

37:27.200 --> 37:30.966
I'm not sure that I'm ready for the kind
of commitment that you're looking for.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.606
- I don't wanna hurt you in the long run, so--
- Wait.

37:35.120 --> 37:39.250
We both almost lost our lives and I'm
emotional too but you can't be serious.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.164
This is me serious, Laurel.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.683
But it doesn't make any sense,
I mean, why? Why now?

37:48.240 --> 37:53.451
- Why even at all?
- I thought that I wanted this. You.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.607
And the other night made me realize I don't.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.086
You're lying.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.051
I am not a liar.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.886
If you've changed
and I know that you've changed...

38:06.040 --> 38:10.523
...then you would--
You would never do this.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.362
Then I guess I haven't changed
as much as we all thought, then.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.882
I know. You think I'm an idiot.

38:37.520 --> 38:41.889
I always thought you were an idiot.
Now I think you're brain dead.

38:42.080 --> 38:45.084
Yeah, you're probably right.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.210
Look, I don't understand this, Roy.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.768
Why is finding the Hood
so important to you?

38:52.200 --> 38:55.409
I can't stop replaying that night
in my head.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.683
The night I got kidnapped by that psycho,
I just... I thought I was gonna die.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.360
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, because of him.

39:03.560 --> 39:08.122
- You don't owe him anything.
- You're wrong, I owe him everything.

39:09.760 --> 39:15.005
I can't go back to the way things were, Thea.
I can't just go back to being nothing.

39:15.240 --> 39:19.086
You're the one that keeps telling me
that I can be better than who I am...

39:19.280 --> 39:21.647
...and this is my chance to be.

39:23.120 --> 39:28.809
I can't explain it.
It feels like my life is connected to his.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.642
So let's find him.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.124
I can tell this means the world to you.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.451
And you mean the world to me.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.166
So let's find him.

39:50.080 --> 39:54.927
You and me. Vigilante, here we come.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.322
Was hoping you'd be here.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.201
I want us to get back on the same page.

40:14.440 --> 40:19.685
Oliver, we're not even in the same book,
you and me, not anymore.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.685
I just did what I thought I had to.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.851
Just like I'm doing what I have to.

Don't do this.

The only thing you have to stop me
from going out that door is an arrow.

FELICITY:
Hey.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.649
Where's he going?

41:04.000 --> 41:08.483
So how did our Robin Hood do?
As expected?

41:08.680 --> 41:11.047
So back to the drawing board we go.

- Ba!

How did you escape?

41:33.080 --> 41:34.241
I didn't.
