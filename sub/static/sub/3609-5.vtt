[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:04.338 --> 00:06.169
Stop! |'|| shoot.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.747
No, you won't, Sun.

00:07.842 --> 00:10.333
- [gunshot]
- [gaSping]

00:10.428 --> 00:12.089
[Juliet] Jack, I need your help.

00:14.098 --> 00:18.341
- Those aren't hers.
- [monotone beep]

00:18.436 --> 00:20.097
She's gone.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.347
The plane was loaded with heroin.

00:28.112 --> 00:30.774
- Where did you find this?
- I found it in the jungle.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.651
Take me there.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.126
Eko? Who's that?

00:45.755 --> 00:47.746
He's my brother.

00:48.299 --> 00:50.585
[sobbing]

00:50.676 --> 00:54.009
Forgive me. Forgive me.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.963
[loud banging]

01:10.488 --> 01:12.024
Here. Eat.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.447
It's OK, Yemi.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.783
[woman] Eko.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.500
All right, Eko. Go.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.014
Did you hear me? Go!

01:41.102 --> 01:43.184
Confess that you have stolen.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.269
Yemi was hungry.

01:45.690 --> 01:50.275
That is not an excuse.
You have sinned, Eko.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.976
Hunger does not matter.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.074
Now go.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.152
Ask God for forgiveness.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.142
Confess!

02:37.742 --> 02:39.983
How long has he been like this?

02:40.077 --> 02:41.453
Couple days now.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.455
Eko?

02:46.542 --> 02:47.827
Can you hear me?

02:52.715 --> 02:54.421
What happened to him?

02:54.508 --> 02:58.251
Before or after we saved him
from the polar bear cave?

02:58.346 --> 03:01.383
Come on. Locke will want to know
you guys are back.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.138
Stay alive, dude, OK?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.363
[man] What are you doing here?

03:23.454 --> 03:25.615
l have come to give my confession.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.242
[chuckles]

03:27.333 --> 03:30.075
- Hello, Eko.
- Hello, brother.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.828
l have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

03:33.923 --> 03:34.878
You mean drugs.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.128
You will make us priests.
We will fly the drugs out ourselves.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.211
My signature does not
make you a priest, Eko.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.136
You could never be a priest.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.135
- No more! Stop! No more!
- Yemi!

03:51.065 --> 03:52.726
Yemi! No!

03:54.610 --> 03:56.146
[grunting]

03:57.738 --> 04:00.980
[bullets ricochet]

04:03.244 --> 04:04.984
[man 2] Father?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.741
Are you OK, Father?

04:09.375 --> 04:13.038
[man] Eko. Eko, wake up.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.846
It is time to confess.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.642
To be judged, brother.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.728
lwill be waiting.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.027
You know where to find me.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.699
You guys smell smoke?

04:50.374 --> 04:51.614
Whoa!

04:51.709 --> 04:54.576
- Get him clear!
- Eko! Help me!

04:58.048 --> 05:00.460
- Pick him up.
- Eko. Come on.

05:00.551 --> 05:04.009
- We got to get you out of here.
- Cover him with a blanket. Careful.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.220
Lay him down. Lay him down.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.604
You're OK. You're all right.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.899
My brother.

05:21.572 --> 05:25.156
- Brother.
- You're all right. It's OK.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.982
- My brother.
- You're all right.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.817
I'll be back.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.996
Brother. Yemi. Yemi.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.459
Charlie, is everyone OK?

05:34.543 --> 05:37.205
- Yeah, we're good.
- Where's Eko?

05:37.296 --> 05:39.628
Hurley and I pulled him out over...

05:42.676 --> 05:44.712
He was right there.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.006
Eko?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.171
Eko?

06:10.079 --> 06:12.616
[grunting]

06:26.554 --> 06:27.919
Good evening, Jack.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.346
Good evening, Ben.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.845
l was hoping you
might join me for a walk.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.889
What?

06:36.981 --> 06:39.063
Well, you say that like...

06:39.149 --> 06:43.438
...you won't throw a bag over my head
and drag me out of here if I say no.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.857
Then don't say no.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.740
Why don't you put this on.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.573
I'll wait outside.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.998
Does it hurt?

07:03.465 --> 07:05.330
Sorry?

07:08.846 --> 07:10.882
Your neck. Does it hurt?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.264
Any numbness in your fingers and toes?

07:14.351 --> 07:18.469
Like pins and needles when
your foot falls asleep, but permanent?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.850
Why are you asking me
these questions, Jack?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.936
Because, Ben...

07:27.031 --> 07:30.865
...you have a tumor on your spine.
An aggressive tumor...

07:30.951 --> 07:33.033
...that is going to kill you.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.789
I don't know when
those X-rays were taken,

07:38.876 --> 07:41.367
but unless they were very recent...

07:43.464 --> 07:46.752
...you're not gonna be
taking walks much longer.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.463
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.762
OK. My mistake then.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.601
I'm ready whenever you are.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.830
Stay here.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.175
As we prepare to send
Colleen on her way,

08:39.269 --> 08:42.352
- I'd like to take a moment to...
- [Juliet] I hate funerals.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.723
He let you out?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.609
Gave me a new shirt too.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.650
Bye, Jack.

09:02.084 --> 09:08.080
[J‘ Brenda Lee: / Wonder]

09:29.737 --> 09:32.103
Why did you show him my X-rays?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.901
I didn't tell him they were yours.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.150
But I guess you did.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.290
I think I know how to find
Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.302
Can I ask why he's being
included in the conversation?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.345
Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.515
Tell him what you told me.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.561
The computer in the hatch
wasn't only for pushing the button.

10:06.023 --> 10:08.685
Now I'm pretty sure

10:08.776 --> 10:11.813
that it could be used
to communicate with other stations.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.394
This is fascinating,

10:13.489 --> 10:16.026
but you just told
me the hatch exploded.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.027
One of them did.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.739
You want to try and
communicate with The Others.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.286
Yep.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.999
No luck, dudes.
We looked everywhere.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.586
Eko's gone.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.955
There was no trail.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.129
Not that we know
what a trail looks like.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.628
When you pulled him out,
did he say anything?

10:34.718 --> 10:37.585
Nothing coherent.
He was just mumbling.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.761
"My brother, my brother."

10:41.558 --> 10:44.345
Sayid, pack your gear.
We're going to that computer.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.724
- Wait, what about Eko?
- We'll catch up to him.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.477
We're all going to the same place.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.604
[panting]

11:20.305 --> 11:22.136
You are home, Father.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.347
[barking]

12:30.626 --> 12:32.366
Father?

12:34.379 --> 12:37.371
Oh, I was looking for Father Yemi.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.508
Father Yemi is gone.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.386
He was called away quite suddenly.

12:49.478 --> 12:53.562
An emergency
at a refugee camp down south.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.641
lam Amina. | work at the clinic.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.402
This is my son, Daniel.
He's the altar boy here.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.361
Are you taking his place?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.324
Yes.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.580
Will Father Yemi still go to London?

13:11.667 --> 13:14.033
- London?
- He was leaving the end of the week.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.793
He was going to continue his studies.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.996
I will take his place there too.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.640
[rattling]

13:57.045 --> 13:58.421
[rattling]

14:09.266 --> 14:11.507
Don't! No! Please!

14:11.601 --> 14:13.102
No!

14:15.939 --> 14:17.645
Shh.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.312
Confess.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.159
We're heading out to the Pearl Station.
There's a computer there

14:39.254 --> 14:43.372
that might help us find our people.
Anybody want to come along?

14:43.467 --> 14:46.004
What do you mean,
"Anybody want to come along?"

14:46.094 --> 14:48.631
I mean, if you'd like to join us,
it's a free island.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.056
Yeah, see, Jack would
go and do stuff alone...

14:53.810 --> 14:56.893
...or he'd take Sayid or Kate.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.222
Yeah, well... I'm not Jack.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.651
- The more the merrier.
- I'll go!

15:04.738 --> 15:06.444
- Great.
- What?

15:06.531 --> 15:11.241
Anybody else wanna come, meet at the
tree line in ten minutes. Bring water.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.364
You're not serious.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.697
What? You always whine
about not being included.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.498
Now's our chance.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.665
Would you mind
if I ask you a question, brother?

15:26.760 --> 15:30.673
- Shoot.
- Are we going to poke at a computer...

15:30.764 --> 15:33.380
...or are we going after your man Eko?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.925
Two birds, one stone.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.980
Eko's heading for the plane that
crashed on top of the Pearl Station.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.017
That's quite a coincidence.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.320
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.942
You're not supposed to do that.
That's holy water.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.695
l'm washing away my sins.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.785
- Father Yemi would never...
- I am not Father Yemi.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.335
[automatic gunfire]

16:45.422 --> 16:46.832
Wait there.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.587
- [clamoring]
- [gunfire continues]

17:01.313 --> 17:03.645
Where is Father Yemi?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.188
Who wants to know?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.446
Perhaps you did not hear me.
Where is Father Yemi?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.277
The shipment is late.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.908
| just got off the telephone.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.832
- They assure me it will arrive Friday.
- What shipment?

17:24.211 --> 17:27.499
You should explain our arrangement
to your new priest.

17:28.465 --> 17:32.674
We receive shipments of vaccines
from the Red Cross. We keep 20 percent.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.173
The rest we give to Emeka and his men.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.254
In exchange for protection.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.134
So you see, Father...

17:42.229 --> 17:44.265
...everybody is happy. Huh?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.555
Everybody's happy.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.767
Everybody benefits.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.359
So I hope you will continue
to honor our arrangements.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.821
I am not afraid of you.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.837
I'll be back for the vaccine
on Friday, Father.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.682
You don't want more
lives on your conscience.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.855
[car revving]

18:37.367 --> 18:40.200
[grunting]

19:00.473 --> 19:05.388
[rattling, clicking]

19:11.484 --> 19:13.349
[footsteps]

19:22.579 --> 19:24.115
Hello, Eko.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.801
You want to guess what's for lunch?

19:45.894 --> 19:48.010
I'm not big on mysteries.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.685
Of course you're not.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.273
You people have cheeseburgers?

19:58.656 --> 20:02.865
You have no idea what I went through
to make this for you.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.204
I killed the cow.
Processed the meat.

20:05.288 --> 20:08.325
Baked the bun. And the fries...

20:09.793 --> 20:11.909
...try rendering animal fat.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.628
- No ketchup?
- [door opening]

20:23.556 --> 20:27.890
- I'd like to talk to him.
- OK. So talk to him.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.889
- Alone, please.
- I'm fine with her being here.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.393
And I'm thrilled that you're fine,
Jack, but it's private.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.691
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.533
Sure.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.324
Of course.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.490
Mind if I eat?

20:59.551 --> 21:02.634
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.596
Break me?

21:07.684 --> 21:11.802
Wear you down until you were convinced
we weren't your enemies.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.978
Get you to trust us.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.767
And then, of course, we'd lead you
to believe that you were choosing to do

21:18.862 --> 21:20.773
whatever we asked you to do.

21:20.864 --> 21:24.948
All of this, of course,
assumed that you would get invested.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.071
Invested in what?

21:27.704 --> 21:32.164
Has it not occurred to you Juliet bears
a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.122
Why are you telling me this?

21:41.217 --> 21:45.711
I'm telling you this, Jack,
because my wonderful plan...

21:45.805 --> 21:47.636
...got shot to sunshine

21:47.724 --> 21:50.887
when you saw my damned X-rays
and figured out l was dying.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.512
All of this...

21:56.816 --> 22:00.104
...you brought me here
to operate on you. You...

22:00.737 --> 22:03.023
You want me to save your life.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.482
No. I want you to want to save my life.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.153
But we're beyond that now, so...

22:14.667 --> 22:17.158
All I can ask is that
you think about it.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.672
Do you believe in God, Jack?

22:32.936 --> 22:34.267
Do you?

22:36.481 --> 22:39.598
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

22:39.692 --> 22:42.308
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.698
And if that's not proof of God,

22:48.785 --> 22:50.446
I don't know what is.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.889
- [grunts, breathing deeply]
- Hey. You sure you're all right?

23:12.976 --> 23:15.968
We can stop for a bit
and catch our breaths.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.516
I'm fine.

23:21.150 --> 23:24.062
You're heading for
the plane wreckage, aren't you?

23:24.153 --> 23:27.816
Charlie heard you call out for
your brother before you left the camp.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.778
Is that what you're doing out here?
Looking for Yemi?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.906
[grunts] Hey!

23:34.998 --> 23:37.410
Do not speak my brother's name again.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.371
What are you so afraid of, Eko?

23:47.885 --> 23:50.012
You need to come back in two days.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.008
Father, what can I do for you?

23:53.600 --> 23:57.513
The vaccines that you spoke of,
how often do these shipments come?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.512
Every six months, if we are lucky.

24:03.026 --> 24:07.360
What makes you so interested
in our shipments of vaccine, Father?

24:09.991 --> 24:12.573
You agree to give most of it
to the militia?

24:13.244 --> 24:15.951
The vaccines fetch
a high price on the black markets.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.199
Whatever you are thinking,
do not cross these men.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.543
Before Father Yemi, we got nothing.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.538
We owe whatever vaccines we have
to his work.

24:29.052 --> 24:31.168
You remind me of him, you know.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.920
You're a good man too.

24:37.185 --> 24:42.054
[music playing on radio]

24:54.869 --> 24:57.110
I hear you have some vaccine to sell.

24:57.497 --> 25:01.240
I do, but it has to be done by Sunday.
I'm leaving the country.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.286
No problem.

25:14.889 --> 25:18.473
The hatch is over here by the plane.
Why don't you take everybody down.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.515
And you?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.468
I'll be there in a minute.

25:25.608 --> 25:29.396
- What's Eko looking for?
- His brother's body's in that plane.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.784
[creaking]

25:54.303 --> 25:57.591
So, what exactly did you see back there?

25:59.892 --> 26:01.473
I saw it once, you know.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.637
- And what did you see?
- I saw a very bright light.

26:08.359 --> 26:09.940
It was beautiful.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.483
That is not what I saw.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.621
[both straining]

26:59.327 --> 27:01.113
My brother's gone.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.948
You set the plane on fire.

27:07.043 --> 27:10.752
Yemi's body could've burned or...
not to mention animals or...

27:22.892 --> 27:25.224
So you don't want to
come down there with us?

27:32.151 --> 27:34.142
No. I will wait here.

27:34.904 --> 27:35.984
Well...

27:38.241 --> 27:40.072
Oh, I forgot.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.197
I found this when l was looking for you.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.537
Hello, Father.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.296
I hear you have
a shipment of vaccine for sale.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.588
If you thought you could do this
without me knowing...

28:42.263 --> 28:43.753
...you don't know who I am.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.886
You know... you're lucky, Father.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.805
I'm a superstitious man.

28:54.317 --> 28:57.104
I don't relish taking the life
of a holy man.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.310
That is why, today...

29:01.324 --> 29:03.485
...l'm only going
to cut off your hands.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.624
[grunting]

29:19.842 --> 29:21.252
No! No!

29:21.719 --> 29:24.085
Please, no! No!

29:24.180 --> 29:26.262
You do not know who I am.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.259
I’m Dr. Mark Wickmund,

30:05.346 --> 30:10.090
and this is the orientation ﬁlm
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.

30:10.184 --> 30:14.348
Station 5, or The Pearl,
is a monitoring station

30:14.438 --> 30:18.556
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

30:18.651 --> 30:20.892
can be observed and recorded...

30:20.987 --> 30:24.229
- Well?
- The wiring is only one-way.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.905
It's a closed system. A dead end.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.358
Hey, guys?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.573
What are these other TVs for?

30:31.664 --> 30:35.327
- Sorry?
- All these TVs.

30:35.418 --> 30:38.000
This guy says
that there's six stations.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.203
Wait, here, check it out.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.588
...is a monitoring station

30:46.679 --> 30:50.672
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

30:50.766 --> 30:52.848
can be observed and recorded...

30:52.935 --> 30:55.221
"Projects." More than one.

30:55.312 --> 30:58.679
So maybe some of these TVs
are connected to the other hatches.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.356
Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.856
Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

31:03.946 --> 31:05.811
see if we can get another picture.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.364
Your tour of duty
will last three weeks...

31:08.451 --> 31:10.612
[toilet flushing]

31:16.542 --> 31:18.282
The toilet still works.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.461
Anything yet?

31:29.013 --> 31:30.844
What about now?

31:35.061 --> 31:37.473
-John?
- Yeah, we got something.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.015
Wow.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.642
- What is it?
- That's a good question.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.853
Those are computers.

31:47.948 --> 31:48.983
Great.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.906
That's what you're looking for.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.154
Now we can get out of here.

31:53.621 --> 31:54.861
[gasps]

32:09.136 --> 32:11.218
I guess he'll be expecting us.

32:15.017 --> 32:16.973
[door opening]

32:24.568 --> 32:27.560
- You don't trust me anymore?
- I trust you just fine.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.395
Just thought I'd put a movie in.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.106
- I'll pass on the movie.
- You'll like this one.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.738
To Kill a Mockingbird.
It's a classic.

32:34.829 --> 32:38.287
- I don't want to watch a movie now.
- I'll turn the sound down then.

32:42.044 --> 32:45.081
I felt like I should apologize,
say I'm sorry.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.423
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

32:49.844 --> 32:53.462
And for everything that's
been done to you and your friends.

32:54.682 --> 32:56.218
You have to know...

32:57.351 --> 32:58.761
...we were desperate.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.720
It was all so we could save his life.

33:06.819 --> 33:07.808
Ben.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.733
He's a great man.

33:13.826 --> 33:18.911
I know you find that
hard to believe, but he is.

33:23.335 --> 33:28.329
You probably feel like
you don't have a choice,

33:28.424 --> 33:30.585
but you do, Jack.

33:32.928 --> 33:36.261
Free will is all we've got, right?

33:42.479 --> 33:48.099
Anyway, ljust wanted
to put in my two cents.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.525
I told you before you can trust me.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.121
I want you to trust me...

34:03.500 --> 34:08.164
...now when | tell you that
doing the surgery is absolutely

34:08.255 --> 34:11.622
the right thing for you to do.

34:15.721 --> 34:20.465
It's the right thing
because he deserves to live.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.356
- Turn the movie off.
- Jack.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.063
Turn it off! Now.

34:39.370 --> 34:40.826
All right. It's off.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.759
Think about what I said.
Please.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.268
- Where are you going?
- London.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.729
Are you a bad man?

35:20.202 --> 35:22.568
My mum says you're a bad man.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.706
Only God knows.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.420
| see you have your vaccine.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.877
Do you expect me to be grateful?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.803
I know what you were planning to do.

35:42.266 --> 35:45.508
- Those men, I helped you...
- They will be replaced by others!

35:50.524 --> 35:53.561
What are they doing?
What is the meaning of this?

35:54.236 --> 35:56.852
We are boarding up the church.

35:57.906 --> 35:59.191
We can no longer use it.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.570
This is Yemi's church.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.119
- You have no right to do this.
- It is no longer sacred.

36:06.206 --> 36:09.448
And one day you will be judged
for what you did.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.625
If I were you,

36:12.713 --> 36:14.920
I would start making my peace now.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.498
I would go to London
and begin to repent

36:17.593 --> 36:20.551
because you owe God
for every life you've taken.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.966
And you truly believe this is Yemi's?

36:27.269 --> 36:29.260
You owe him one church.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.082
Yemi.

36:54.088 --> 36:55.624
Wait.

36:57.925 --> 36:58.914
Yemi.

37:01.595 --> 37:03.051
Yemi.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.677
You say you want to hear my confession.

37:08.811 --> 37:11.143
Why? Why now?

37:12.272 --> 37:14.308
Show yourself. Where are you?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.065
Where?

37:37.172 --> 37:38.673
Are you ready, Eko?

37:43.095 --> 37:44.505
Yes.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.964
I am ready, Yemi.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.190
| ask for no forgiveness, Father.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.361
For l have not sinned.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.372
l have only done
what I needed to do to survive.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.298
A small boy once asked me

38:24.094 --> 38:26.881
if I was a bad man.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.714
If I could answer him now,

38:30.392 --> 38:31.893
lwould tell him

38:32.728 --> 38:35.720
that, when l was a young boy,

38:35.814 --> 38:39.932
I killed a man
to save my brother's life.

38:43.906 --> 38:46.568
I am not sorry for this.

38:47.242 --> 38:49.574
I am proud of this.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.457
I did not ask for
the life that l was given...

39:02.633 --> 39:05.466
...but it was given, nonetheless.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.127
And with it...

39:09.223 --> 39:11.259
...I did my best.

39:18.315 --> 39:21.102
You speak to me as if
I were your brother.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.442
Who are you?

39:36.667 --> 39:37.873
Who are you?!

39:38.669 --> 39:40.625
Who are you?!

39:47.511 --> 39:49.126
Who are you?

39:50.138 --> 39:52.720
[rattling]

39:59.481 --> 40:01.563
[rattling]

40:01.650 --> 40:05.359
[growling]

40:10.826 --> 40:12.987
The Lord is my shepherd.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.864
I shall not want.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.993
He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness...

40:21.253 --> 40:23.915
[grunting]

40:24.006 --> 40:26.839
[wailing roar]

40:33.765 --> 40:34.845
[grunting]

40:49.156 --> 40:50.737
Eko.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.916
Oh, Eko.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.055
It's OK. It's OK.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.703
What did he say, John?

42:26.378 --> 42:29.211
He said... we're next.
