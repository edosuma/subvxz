43:05.541 --> 43:09.253
Because of this tragic incident,
the owners of Serrano Point...

43:09.420 --> 43:12.631
...and six other power plants
across the nation...

43:12.799 --> 43:17.511
...are entering into a partnership
with my corporation, Automite Systems.

43:17.845 --> 43:20.264
New automated technology
we have developed...

43:20.431 --> 43:23.016
...will be implemented
in all control rooms.

43:23.184 --> 43:27.437
These sophisticated machines will
eliminate the possibility of human error...

43:27.605 --> 43:29.356
...and prevent a major disaster.
