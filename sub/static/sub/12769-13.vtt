PREVIOUSLY
ON "PRIVATE PRACTICE"...

00:09.250 --> 00:11.917
(Violet) COOPER,
CHARLOTTE WAS RAPED.
IT'S NUMBER 2.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.917
THE D.A. WON'T PROSECUTE
LEE McHENRY.
YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN, LEE.
YOU'LL RAPE ANOTHER WOMAN.

00:14.959 --> 00:18.083
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
(Cooper) THAT MAN
CANNOT GO FREE.

00:18.125 --> 00:20.750
I WILL GET A GUN,
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A MUGGING.

00:20.792 --> 00:23.041
I'M SORRY, SUSAN.
THE CANCER HAS SPREAD,

00:23.083 --> 00:24.750
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.
(gasps)

00:24.792 --> 00:26.417
YOU WILL SAVE HER LIFE!

00:26.458 --> 00:28.667
ADDISON.
(Bizzy) I'M MARRYING SUSAN.

00:28.709 --> 00:30.792
I KNOW THE CANCER'S COME BACK.
I SIGNED A D.N.R.,

00:30.834 --> 00:32.875
AND YOU CAN'T TELL BIZZY.

00:36.625 --> 00:40.458

00:40.500 --> 00:42.250
(equipment beeping)

00:42.291 --> 00:43.875
(monitor beeping erratically)

00:43.917 --> 00:46.875
SHE'S CRASHING.
I NEED A C.B.C., CHEM PANEL,

00:46.917 --> 00:49.834
AND A BLOOD CULTURE TIMES 3.
AND HANG 2 LITERS OF SALINE,
WIDE-OPEN.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.375
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:51.417 --> 00:53.917
SET UP A CENTRAL LINE
AND START A DOPAMINE DRIP.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.417
ADDISON,
TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING.

00:56.458 --> 00:59.041
CAN'T GET A BLOOD PRESSURE.
SHE'S IN SHOCK.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.458
PROBABLY SEPTIC.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.083
OKAY, LINE'S IN.

01:03.125 --> 01:06.041
TITRATE THE DOPAMINE
TO A PRESSURE OF 90.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.458
(beeping continues)

01:09.500 --> 01:11.458
ADDISON?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.875
IT'S GONNA TAKE A MINUTE FOR
THE MEDICINE TO TAKE EFFECT.

01:14.917 --> 01:18.041

01:18.083 --> 01:20.041
(beeping normalizes)

90.
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:22.709 --> 01:25.041

OKAY, PRESSURE'S COMING UP.

01:25.083 --> 01:27.125
GO AHEAD AND HANG
THE FIRST DOSE OF ANTIBIOTICS.

01:27.166 --> 01:30.500

GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

01:30.542 --> 01:32.041
(exhales)

01:32.083 --> 01:33.750
SHE'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.709
WHEW.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.709
OH, HEY, AMELIA.
HAVE YOU GOT A MINUTE?

01:42.750 --> 01:44.709
NO. I HAVE NOT HEARD
FROM ADDISON ABOUT SUSAN,

01:44.750 --> 01:46.709
AND I'M LATE
FOR THE DORKFEST THAT IS

01:46.750 --> 01:48.709
THE NEUROLOGY DEPARTMENT
MONTHLY BREAKFAST ROUNDTABLE.

01:48.750 --> 01:50.458
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.041
IT IS. IT'S BORING
AND SELF-CONGRATULATORY.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.458
(lid clatters)

01:54.500 --> 01:57.458
CAN YOU GIVE ME A REASON,
ANY REASON, FOR A NO-SHOW?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.041
LIZZIE HAGAN. ARMY VET,
JUST BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.041
I.E.D. EXPLOSION--
LOST HER RIGHT EYE,

02:02.083 --> 02:05.041
DECREASED VISION IN HER LEFT
BECAUSE OF SHRAPNEL

02:05.083 --> 02:07.041
LODGED IN HER BRAIN.
TOUGH CHOICE.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.041
HELP A WOUNDED SOLDIER
SEE AGAIN

02:09.083 --> 02:11.041
OR ENDURE
A BUNCH OF LAME OLD MEN

02:11.083 --> 02:13.959
JOKING ABOUT MY FRONTAL LOBES.

02:15.208 --> 02:17.792
ERIC AND I, WE HAD JUST
FOUND OUT THAT MORNING

02:17.834 --> 02:19.166
THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.166
WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO CELEBRATE

02:21.208 --> 02:23.166
BEFORE THEY PUT US
IN THE CONVOY.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.166
HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO,

02:25.208 --> 02:27.041
BUT I COULDN'T SAY NO.

02:27.083 --> 02:30.959
ANYWAY, ERIC AND I, WE WERE--
WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER

02:31.000 --> 02:33.041
AND WE WERE WHISPERING
BACK AND FORTH

02:33.083 --> 02:35.583
ABOUT A SPRING WEDDING.

02:35.625 --> 02:38.041
AND, UM...

02:38.083 --> 02:40.208
AND THEN WE HIT THE I.E.D.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.208
AND EVERYTHING
WENT REALLY BRIGHT

02:42.250 --> 02:44.041
AND THEN REALLY DARK.

02:44.083 --> 02:47.041
AND I WAS
THROWN OUT OF OUR HUMVEE.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.041
AND I TRIED TO GET UP
AND LOOK FOR ERIC,

02:50.083 --> 02:53.041
BUT I COULDN'T SEE.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.041
TAKE YOUR TIME, LIZZIE.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.083
(inhales deeply)

02:57.125 --> 03:00.500
(exhales deeply)

03:00.542 --> 03:03.041
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PROCESS
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME

03:03.083 --> 03:05.625
UNTIL I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL

03:05.667 --> 03:08.083
AND I REALIZED
THAT I COULD BARELY SEE

03:08.125 --> 03:10.333
ANY OF THE DOCTORS
WHO WERE TALKING.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.125
HOW'S THE VISION
IN YOUR LEFT EYE?

03:13.166 --> 03:17.041
I CAN SEE SHAPES AND FORMS,
BUT IT'S PRETTY BLURRY.

03:17.083 --> 03:21.125
IS THERE...
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?

03:21.166 --> 03:23.125
WELL,
LET ME TAKE SOME SCANS.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.959
DEPENDING ON HOW THE SHRAPNEL
IS COMPRESSING YOUR OPTIC NERVE,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.667
I MAY BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.375
(sniffles)

03:31.417 --> 03:33.375
LOSING ERIC AND MY INJURIES,

03:33.417 --> 03:36.041
IT'S JUST
ALL BEEN REALLY HARD.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.542
BUT SINCE NATASHA WAS BORN
TWO MONTHS AGO,

03:38.583 --> 03:41.709
I-I HAVE TO BE HOPEFUL,
FOR HER SAKE AND FOR MINE.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.583
WE'RE ALL EACH OTHER HAS.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.375
LIZZIE, IS NATASHA
STILL LATCHING ON?

03:46.417 --> 03:48.041
I THINK SO. YEAH. WHY?

03:48.083 --> 03:50.083
SHE'S TURNING BLUE.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.709
WHAT'S WRONG?
HERE. SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.041
AMELIA, BAG.
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HER?

03:55.083 --> 03:57.041
DR. WILDER IS TRYING
TO RESUSCITATE YOUR BABY.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.875
OH, GOD.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

03:59.917 --> 04:03.250
YOU--YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER.
NATASHA?

04:03.291 --> 04:05.250
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

04:05.291 --> 04:07.291
WHITE MALE, 30s,
STABBED IN THE CHEST.
STABLE?

04:07.333 --> 04:10.291
HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,
AND THERE'S A KNIFE.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.917
SO HE WAS HITTING YOU?

04:11.959 --> 04:14.959
HE'S... I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT HE WOULDN'T STOP!

04:15.000 --> 04:17.333
AND I SAW THE KNIFE,
AND I JUST GRABBED IT,

04:17.375 --> 04:19.333
AND... (sobbing)
LET'S--LET'S GO.

04:19.375 --> 04:22.458
BLOOD PRESSURE, PULSE?
130 OVER 90. PULSE IS 120.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.250
OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
A PORTABLE ULTRASOUND.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.250
AM I GONNA MAKE IT, DOC?

04:27.291 --> 04:30.250
WE'RE GONNA DO THE BEST WE CAN.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SIR?

04:30.291 --> 04:33.542
(panting) LEE...

04:33.583 --> 04:36.208
(grunts) McHENRY.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.959
(continues panting)

04:46.458 --> 04:49.500
(speaking inaudibly)

04:49.542 --> 04:52.041
I WAS JUST CHECKING ON SUSAN
AND I HEARD.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.917
WHAT HAPPENED?
HE WAS USING HIS GIRLFRIEND
AS A PUNCHING BAG.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.667
SHE DECIDED TO DEFEND HERSELF
USING THIS.
IS HE GONNA MAKE IT?

04:57.709 --> 04:59.041
I DON'T KNOW.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.041
THE BLADE CUT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH THE LUNG TISSUE.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.667
IT'S LODGED NEAR THE HEART,
ACTING LIKE A STOPPER,

05:03.709 --> 05:06.709
PREVENTING HIM
FROM BLEEDING OUT.
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU TAKE IT OUT?

05:06.750 --> 05:08.083
WELL, RIGHT NOW HE'LL DIE.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.583
WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL
HIS BLOOD IS CLOTTING BETTER

05:10.625 --> 05:12.583
BEFORE WE CAN OPERATE.
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.041
I DON'T KNOW. IF HE'S LUCKY
IT'LL BE BEFORE

05:15.083 --> 05:17.709
THE PRESSURE BUILDS TOO MUCH
AND HIS HEART RUPTURES.
SOMEONE SHOULD GIVE
HIS GIRLFRIEND

05:17.750 --> 05:19.375
A MEDAL FOR DOING THIS.

05:19.417 --> 05:22.000
DOES CHARLOTTE KNOW
THAT HE'S HERE?

05:24.083 --> 05:27.041
UH, CLEARLY, LIZZIE'S EYESIGHT
IS WORSE THAN SHE'S TELLING US.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.709
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
AN ACCIDENT?
IF WE HADN'T BEEN THERE--

05:29.750 --> 05:31.834
WHAT HAPPENED?
ONE OF PETE'S PATIENT'S

05:31.875 --> 05:34.291
SMOTHERED HER BABY
WHILE BREAST-FEEDING.
IS THE BABY OKAY?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.375
FOR NOW.
AMELIA, SHE--

05:36.417 --> 05:39.000
WELL, NOW IT DOES HAPPEN.
NEW MOMS FALL ASLEEP

05:39.041 --> 05:41.083
OR--OR HOLD THE BABY
TOO TIGHTLY.
THIS MOM'S BLIND.

05:41.125 --> 05:44.041
PARTIALLY BLIND.
WITH THE PROPER INSTRUCTION,

05:44.083 --> 05:46.041
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.375
THERE'S A MILLION COMPLICATIONS
THAT BLIND PARENTS FACE

05:48.417 --> 05:51.375
THAT SEEING PARENTS
JUST DON'T.
BUT BLIND PARENTS
RAISE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME

05:51.417 --> 05:53.500
WITH HELP.
SINGLE MOM,
NO FAMILY AROUND.

05:53.542 --> 05:55.333
CAN SHE AFFORD A NANNY?

05:55.375 --> 05:57.125
NOT ON DISABILITY.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.834
SHE IS THE MOTHER OF THAT CHILD.
SHE HAS A RIGHT TO RAISE HER.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.417
AS ALONG AS THE CHILD
IS PROTECTED.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.083
IF SHE CAN'T DO THAT, THEN--
THEN WE NEED TO HELP HER.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.208
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:10.250 --> 06:13.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

06:13.709 --> 06:15.667
BIZZY, YOU SHOULD
GO BACK TO THE HOTEL,

06:15.709 --> 06:17.041
GET SOME REST.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.875
NO, NOT WHILE SUSAN'S HERE.

06:18.917 --> 06:21.041
THE CHEMOTHERAPY HAS
SUPPRESSED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM,

06:21.083 --> 06:24.542
AND SHE HAD TROUBLE FIGHTING OFF
THE INFECTION, BUT NOW--

06:24.583 --> 06:28.000
SHE'S FINE. SHE JUST
NEEDS SLEEP, AND YOU DO, TOO.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.041
GO.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.250
(sighs)

06:31.291 --> 06:34.041
CALL ME IF SHE WAKES.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.083
(sighs)

06:37.125 --> 06:39.917
(sighs)
SHE LOVES HER...

06:39.959 --> 06:41.041
MM-HMM.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.500
VERY MUCH.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.291
YEAH, SHE DOES.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.917
(elevator bell dings)

06:48.959 --> 06:51.667
I WAS JUST COMING TO SEE YOU.
JANET, UH, PETE WILDER,

06:51.709 --> 06:53.667
THE DOCTOR WHO REFERRED
LIZZIE TO ME.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.583
HELLO.
HI. YOU KNOW LIZZIE?

06:55.625 --> 06:58.458
ERIC, MY SON,
WAS HER BOYFRIEND.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.125
I'M SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.
THANK YOU.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.333
I DIDN'T REALIZE ERIC
HAD FAMILY NEARBY.
ACTUALLY, I LIVE IN SAN DIEGO,

07:04.375 --> 07:06.875
BUT WHEN DR. SHEPHERD CALLED
THIS MORNING,

07:06.917 --> 07:09.041
I DROVE STRAIGHT UP.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.041
I'M HERE TO TAKE HOME
MY SON'S BABY.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.458
SAM?

07:20.083 --> 07:22.250
IS HE...

07:22.291 --> 07:24.041
HOW BAD IS IT?

07:24.083 --> 07:26.083
HE'S GOT A KNIFE IN HIS CHEST.

07:26.125 --> 07:29.250
HE'S NOT STABLE ENOUGH
FOR ME TO OPERATE,

07:29.291 --> 07:31.250
SO I CAN'T REMOVE IT YET.

07:31.291 --> 07:34.166
CHARLOTTE, THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO DO HERE.

07:35.792 --> 07:39.000
IF HE DIES,
WOULD ANYONE BE SURPRISED?

07:41.083 --> 07:45.041
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO WANT SOMEBODY DEAD,

07:45.083 --> 07:47.250
SOMEONE WHO DESERVES IT,

07:47.291 --> 07:49.625
BUT TO ACTUALLY ALLOW
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN...

07:51.542 --> 07:53.375
WHO WOULD CARE?

07:54.917 --> 07:57.375
SAM, IF I--

07:57.417 --> 08:00.417
(woman) CODE BLUE, BAY THREE.
CODE BLUE, BAY THREE.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.000
THAT'S LEE. HE'S CRASHING.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.750
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
CHARLOTTE?

08:21.625 --> 08:23.583
(Lee gasping)

08:23.625 --> 08:25.583
(monitor beeping erratically)

08:25.625 --> 08:27.500
HIS SATs ARE DROPPING.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.166
ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME AN INTUBATION TRAY.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.375
(gasps)

08:31.417 --> 08:34.792
CAN YOU...
CAN YOU TAKE IT OUT?

08:34.834 --> 08:37.583
I HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR CHEST,
WHICH MEANS PUTTING YOU

08:37.625 --> 08:39.041
ON A BYPASS MACHINE.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.041
THAT'S GONNA THIN YOUR BLOOD,
AND RIGHT NOW,

08:41.083 --> 08:43.041
WITH THE DAMAGE TO YOUR LUNG,

08:43.083 --> 08:46.125
YOU'D BLEED OUT
AND DIE ON THE TABLE.
(coughs)

08:46.166 --> 08:48.208
(gasps)

08:48.250 --> 08:51.208
NOW I'M GONNA PUT
A TUBE DOWN YOUR THROAT

08:51.250 --> 08:54.166
TO SUCTION ALL THE BLOOD OUT
SO YOU DON'T DROWN.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.542
BUT THE KNIFE--
IT'S BAD EITHER WAY.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.375
(pants)
PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE.

08:59.417 --> 09:00.750
SHH.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.792
(beeping continues)

09:03.834 --> 09:06.041
YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH HER.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.667
YEAH.
SHE'S--

09:08.709 --> 09:12.041
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING
YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT HER.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.834
SEDATE HIM.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.291
(pants)

09:16.333 --> 09:18.458
(beeping continues)

09:18.500 --> 09:20.458
I DIDN'T FIND OUT
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY

09:20.500 --> 09:22.792
UNTIL AFTER I BURIED ERIC.

09:22.834 --> 09:27.041
THE ARMY SENT ME HIS THINGS,
AND I, UH...

09:27.083 --> 09:31.458
I FOUND A, UH,
A HALF-WRITTEN LETTER.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.458
SO I CALLED LIZZIE.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.709
SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.083
SHE WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT
AND SCARED, AND I--

09:38.125 --> 09:40.291
I TOLD HER
TO COME SEE OUR DOCTORS,

09:40.333 --> 09:43.041
HAVE THE BABY IN SAN DIEGO.
YOU WANTED TO HELP.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.041
OF COURSE.
MAYBE I PUSHED TOO HARD.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.041
FIRST SHE STOPPED RETURNING
MY CALLS,

09:48.083 --> 09:51.709
THEN SHE MOVED APARTMENTS
WITHOUT TELLING US.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.500
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE HAD GIVEN BIRTH

09:54.542 --> 09:56.959
UNTIL A WEEK AFTER
IT HAPPENED.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.041
LOOK, I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST LIZZIE,

10:00.083 --> 10:01.750
BUT NATASHA
IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

10:01.792 --> 10:03.750
AND I HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO HER,

10:03.792 --> 10:05.333
WHICH IS...

10:05.375 --> 10:07.333
THE BABY
SHOULD COME BACK WITH ME.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.041
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO LIZZIE?

10:09.083 --> 10:11.458
SHE CAN STAY HERE AND GET
THE MEDICAL HELP SHE NEEDS.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.041
WE'LL BRING HER DOWN
FOR VISITS, ON--ON HOLIDAYS.

10:14.083 --> 10:16.625
SO YOU WANT HER
TO GIVE UP HER BABY?

10:16.667 --> 10:19.917
DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL HAVE A CHOICE?
DR. SHEPHERD CAN OPERATE

10:19.959 --> 10:22.041
AND HELP LIZZIE REGAIN
THE VISION IN HER GOOD EYE.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.291
MAYBE. I MEAN, EVEN IF
HER SCANS LOOK GOOD,

10:24.333 --> 10:26.750
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
IT'LL BE SUCCESSFUL.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.458
BUT I KNOW
LIZZIE WANTS TO TRY.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.041
THEN YOU'LL TRY.
BUT IF YOU CAN'T GIVE LIZZIE
BACK HER EYESIGHT,

10:33.083 --> 10:36.000
NATASHA IS COMING HOME
WITH ME.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.542
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM ADDISON?

10:42.583 --> 10:44.875
YEAH. SUSAN'S STABILIZED,

10:44.917 --> 10:48.500
AND SHE'S RESPONDING
TO ANTIBIOTICS, SO...
OH, GOOD.
BIZZY MUST BE RELIEVED.

10:48.542 --> 10:51.458
YEAH.
I GOT LIZZIE'S SCANS BACK.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK?

10:51.500 --> 10:54.041
NO, NO, NO, NO.
LET ME PICK YOU UP.

10:54.083 --> 10:58.583
OKAY. OKAY, WELL, I'M--
I'M--I'M HERE. I'LL BE HERE.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.041
(cell phone beeps)

11:00.083 --> 11:03.291
UM...

11:03.333 --> 11:05.792
LEE McHENRY

11:05.834 --> 11:08.792
IS IN THE I.C.U.
WITH A KNIFE IN HIS CHEST.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.000
OH, COOPER.
WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING?

11:11.041 --> 11:13.792
WHAT?
YEAH, AND SAM WANTS
TO TRY TO SAVE HIM.

11:13.834 --> 11:16.500
WELL, THAT'S HIS JOB.
IF VIOLET HAD BEEN ATTACKED, I
WOULDN'T WANT SAM BEING A HERO.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.041
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO LET HIM DIE?
HOW IS CHARLOTTE?

11:19.083 --> 11:21.792
SHE CAN BARELY TALK ABOUT IT.
I...

11:23.375 --> 11:27.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS NIGHTMARE IS NOT OVER.

11:31.083 --> 11:34.041
HEY.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.750
YOU'RE LOOKING BETTER.

11:35.792 --> 11:38.792
NOW I JUST NEED
TO GET OUTTA HERE.

11:38.834 --> 11:40.959
ALL OF THE TUBES
AND THE DRUGS--

11:41.000 --> 11:44.166
AND NO OFFENSE,
THE DOCTORS...

11:44.208 --> 11:45.375
(laughs)

11:45.417 --> 11:48.041
I'M JUST SO TIRED OF IT ALL.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.667
AND POOR BIZZY.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.667
OH, SHE'LL BE FINE.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.667
SHE'S NOTHING
IF NOT RESILIENT.

11:53.709 --> 11:55.750
(both laugh)

11:55.792 --> 11:59.583
IN HER WAY, SHE'S...

11:59.625 --> 12:01.500
AMAZING.

12:01.542 --> 12:05.208
IT WAS A NICE WEDDING,
WASN'T IT?

12:05.250 --> 12:07.625
MM-HMM.

12:07.667 --> 12:09.417
(gasps)

12:09.458 --> 12:11.041
(monitor beeping erratically)

12:11.083 --> 12:13.500
(strained voice) OH, MY...

12:13.542 --> 12:16.458
CHEST.
I NEED A BLOOD GAS
AND A BOLUS OF HEPARIN. GO.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.625
HURTS... TO BREATHE.

12:18.667 --> 12:22.041
SUSAN, YOU MAY HAVE THROWN
A CLOT IN YOUR LUNG.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.417
YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT YOU DIDN'T--

12:24.458 --> 12:25.625
NO.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.417
NO HEROICS. PLEASE.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.041
(beeping continues)

12:31.083 --> 12:32.542
BIZZY.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.834
I'LL GET HER.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.208
BIZZY.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.458
(beeping continues)

12:41.500 --> 12:44.625
(elevator bell dings)

12:44.667 --> 12:45.959
HEY.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.834
YOU OKAY?

12:49.875 --> 12:52.834
IT'S NEVER GONNA BE OVER,
IS IT?

12:52.875 --> 12:55.041
IT COULD BE.

12:55.083 --> 12:58.625
IF I TELL SAM TO KILL...

12:58.667 --> 13:01.291
LEE...

13:01.333 --> 13:05.000
THAT'S ON ME, FOREVER.

13:06.458 --> 13:10.583
IF I TELL SAM
TO SAVE LEE...

13:10.625 --> 13:13.041
HE'LL ALWAYS BE OUT THERE.
CHARLOTTE, WAIT.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.333
EITHER WAY, COOP,
I LOSE.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.125
(monitor beeping erratically)

13:20.166 --> 13:23.041
HANG A T.P.A. AND INCREASE
THE OXYGEN TO 100%.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.041
SUSAN.

13:25.083 --> 13:28.709
YOU SAID I COULD GO.
YOU SAID SHE'D BE ALL RIGHT.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.709
SUSAN HAS

13:30.750 --> 13:33.083
A LARGE BLOOD CLOT
IN HER LUNG,

13:33.125 --> 13:35.583
AND WE'RE TREATING IT
AS AGGRESSIVELY AS WE CAN,

13:35.625 --> 13:40.375
BUT SHE--
WELL, DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO.
I WANT MORE, MUCH MORE.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.834
(monitor beeping erratically)
NO PULSE.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.500
DR. MONTGOMERY,
SHOULD I CALL THE CODE TEAM?

13:47.542 --> 13:50.792
(beeping continues)

13:50.834 --> 13:52.834
NO.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.208
(beeping continues)

13:54.250 --> 13:57.041
WHY AREN'T YOU
DOING ANYTHING?

13:57.083 --> 14:00.041
SUSAN SIGNED A D.N.R.
SHE DIDN'T WANT ME TO TELL YOU.

14:00.083 --> 14:04.000
I DON'T CARE. SAVE HER.
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.041
YOU CAN.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.792
SUSAN WAS CLEAR.

14:07.834 --> 14:11.792
ADDISON! DO SOMETHING!

14:11.834 --> 14:14.458
OH! (sobs)

14:14.500 --> 14:16.959
COME ON. COME ON.
BIZZY.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.041
HELP HER!
BIZZY.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.792
YOU CAN'T JUST STAND THERE
AND WATCH HER DIE!
BIZZY. BIZZY.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.542
YOU CAN'T...
BIZZY.

TO AN EXAM ROOM.

I COULD PUT

16:13.834 --> 16:15.542

16:15.583 --> 16:19.166

16:19.208 --> 16:21.875
I WANTED HIM TO FEEL PAIN...

16:21.917 --> 16:23.333
AND FEAR.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.458
AND NOW?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.417
I DON'T KNOW.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.166
CHARLOTTE,
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

16:34.208 --> 16:36.792
THAT I DON'T NORMALLY DO.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.792
I CAN'T BE OBJECTIVE HERE
BECAUSE IT'S YOU

16:38.834 --> 16:41.041
AND BECAUSE I WAS
A PART OF THIS.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.709
AND, UH, I'M JUST GONNA
TELL YOU WHAT I THINK,

16:43.750 --> 16:45.375
AND THAT IS THAT...

16:45.417 --> 16:47.208
YOU MAKE
LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS

16:47.250 --> 16:50.041
FOR PATIENTS EVERY DAY,
AND I SEE YOU DO IT.

16:50.083 --> 16:53.041
YOU'RE LOGICAL AND BRILLIANT
AND DISPASSIONATE,

16:53.083 --> 16:55.583
AND... IF I EVER HAD
AN EMERGENCY,

16:55.625 --> 16:58.166
I WOULD WANT YOU
TO BE MY DOCTOR.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.250
IF YOU SAW HIM ON THE STREET,

17:00.291 --> 17:03.041
AND HE TRIED
TO ATTACK YOU AGAIN,

17:03.083 --> 17:05.041
I BELIEVE YOU COULD KILL HIM.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.792
BUT WHEN HE COMES INTO
YOUR HOSPITAL NEEDING HELP,

17:08.834 --> 17:10.834
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.375
HE TOOK A LOT FROM YOU,
CHARLOTTE.

17:13.417 --> 17:17.041
BUT YOU CAN'T LET HIM TAKE
WHAT MAKES YOU YOU.

17:17.083 --> 17:21.000
(exhales deeply)

17:21.041 --> 17:22.375
(Amelia) THE SHRAPNEL IS...

17:22.417 --> 17:24.000
(clicks keyboard keys)

17:24.041 --> 17:25.542
IT'S THERE.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.625
IT'S AMAZING.
I'M WALKING AND TALKING

17:27.667 --> 17:30.041
WITH A PIECE OF METAL
IN MY HEAD.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.041
CAN YOU GET TO IT SAFELY?

17:32.083 --> 17:35.041
I CAN GET TO IT, BUT IT
MIGHT BE BETTER TO LEAVE IT.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.625
WHY?

17:36.667 --> 17:38.041
THE SHRAPNEL IS WEDGED

17:38.083 --> 17:40.083
RIGHT UP AGAINST THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR OPTIC NERVE.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.083
THE SCAR TISSUE HAS HEALED
AROUND IT.

17:42.125 --> 17:45.041
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
TO GET OUT, AND IF I CUT

17:45.083 --> 17:47.375
OR DAMAGE THE NERVE
WHILE I'M IN THERE TRYING,

17:47.417 --> 17:49.375
YOU COULD LOSE WHATEVER
EYESIGHT YOU STILL HAVE LEFT.

17:49.417 --> 17:51.417
IT COULD ALSO CAUSE A BLEED
IN YOUR BRAIN

17:51.458 --> 17:53.417
THAT WOULD
BE DIFFICULT TO STOP.

17:53.458 --> 17:55.792
I WANT THE SURGERY.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.792
LIZZIE...

17:57.834 --> 18:00.750
I TALKED TO ERIC'S MOM,
JANET, AND SHE--

18:00.792 --> 18:03.417
YOU WHAT?
SH-SHE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.417
SHE WANTS TO HELP
WITH YOU AND NATASHA.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.041
SHE WANTS TO TAKE NATASHA.
SHE ALWAYS HAS.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.750
LIZZIE,
WILL YOU EXCUSE US

18:11.792 --> 18:14.250
FOR JUST ONE MINUTE?

18:18.458 --> 18:20.083
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

18:20.125 --> 18:22.750
THE SIDE THAT SAYS WE DO
WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR PATIENT.

18:22.792 --> 18:25.041
WHICH IS WHY
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED JANET

18:25.083 --> 18:28.875
TO TAKE AWAY LIZZIE'S BABY.
JUST DO THE SURGERY.
IT IS DANGEROUS,
AND THERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.875
LIZZIE LOSING NATASHA?

18:30.917 --> 18:32.875
SHE CAN'T SEE, PETE.
SHE HAS NO MONEY.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.041
HER ENTIRE LIFE IS GONNA BE
AN UPHILL BATTLE,

18:35.083 --> 18:37.041
WHICH MEANS THAT NATASHA'S
WILL BE, TOO.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.625
LOOK, IF JANET WANTS TO HELP--
JANET IS NOT THE PATIENT.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.709
DO THE SURGERY.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.166
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:48.208 --> 18:50.333
(Cooper) WHERE IS HE?

18:50.375 --> 18:52.041
DON'T DO THIS. DON'T--

18:52.083 --> 18:54.375
HOW'S IT FEEL,
YOU PIECE OF CRAP, HUH...

18:54.417 --> 18:56.709
TO HAVE SOMEONE ATTACK YOU?!
COOPER, WALK AWAY.

18:56.750 --> 18:59.542
YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!
I AM HER FIANCé!
COOPER.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.125
I NEED 30 SECONDS ALONE
IN A ROOM WITH YOU!
WALK AWAY. WALK AWAY.

19:02.166 --> 19:05.125
LET ME GO! Y-YOU DON'T WANNA--
YOU DON'T WANNA--I'LL DO IT.

19:05.166 --> 19:08.041
I'LL DO IT.
YOU WANT TO GO IN THERE?
FINE. GO IN THERE. GO.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.041
KILL HIM.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.542
WHY ARE YOU HELPING HIM?

19:12.583 --> 19:14.792
WHY IS HE STILL ALIVE?

19:18.417 --> 19:21.000
I DON'T WANT CHARLOTTE
TO FALL APART AGAIN

19:21.041 --> 19:22.834
RIGHT WHEN
SHE'S GETTING BETTER.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.959
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.166
NOTHING.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.542
(sighs)
DID YOU COME HERE TO--

19:29.583 --> 19:32.333
OH, BUTT OUT, SHELDON.
COME ON, COOPER.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.041
NO. YOU'RE NOT PART OF THIS.
NO, I AM VERY MUCH
A PART OF THIS.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.834
I HAD LEE IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM
AND DIDN'T PUT IT TOGETHER

19:37.875 --> 19:40.583
THAT HE WAS THE ONE
WHO HURT CHARLOTTE.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.834
I'M THE REASON THAT CHARLOTTE'S
I.D. AFTER THE SECOND LINEUP

19:42.875 --> 19:45.041
GOT TOSSED OUT. ALL I DID DO
IS LET THAT ANIMAL CHOKE ME.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.667
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT, COOPER?
YOU KNOW WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT?

19:48.709 --> 19:51.834
I CONSIDER CHARLOTTE A FRIEND,
AND I FAILED HER.

19:51.875 --> 19:56.000
I FAILED MY FRIEND. SO DON'T
TELL ME THAT I'M NOT INVOLVED.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.667
I'M SORRY.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.959
YOU'VE WAITED THIS LONG.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.458
JUST LET HIM DIE. PLEASE.

20:35.625 --> 20:39.166
I THOUGHT THE NURSES
WERE... CONFUSED

20:39.208 --> 20:42.000
WHEN THEY SAID
YOU WERE IN HERE.

20:43.750 --> 20:47.041
THIS IS WHAT ONE DOES
AFTER A DEATH, ISN'T IT--

20:47.083 --> 20:52.208
TURN TO GOD,
LOOK FOR SOLACE?

20:52.250 --> 20:55.834
I'M SO, SO SORRY. I...

20:55.875 --> 20:57.875
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO,

20:57.917 --> 21:00.667
IF YOU WANT
TO COME STAY WITH ME--
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.834
IF I COULD'VE HELPED SUSAN--
YOU COULD HAVE.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.750
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE WANTED.
THE D.N.R.--

21:06.792 --> 21:08.250
ENOUGH. IT'S DONE.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.959
YOU KNOW
THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING...

21:16.000 --> 21:18.250
FOR YOU, DON'T...

21:21.792 --> 21:23.959
I'M TRYING, YOU KNOW?
I'M--

21:24.000 --> 21:26.709
IS THIS MAKING YOU
FEEL BETTER, ADDISON?

21:26.750 --> 21:28.750
DO YOU REALLY NOT UNDERSTAND,

21:28.792 --> 21:31.917
OR DO YOU JUST NEED TO BLAME
SOMEONE FOR WHAT HAPPENED?

21:31.959 --> 21:35.834
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE, DEAR?

21:47.417 --> 21:49.000
(footsteps approach)

21:49.041 --> 21:51.667
(Naomi) CHARLOTTE.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.709
COOPER'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.208
I KNOW.

21:58.041 --> 22:01.542
HE KNOCKS HER AROUND
AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE,

22:01.583 --> 22:04.000
YET THERE SHE SITS,

22:04.041 --> 22:06.166
KEEPING A VIGIL.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.542
(exhales)

22:07.583 --> 22:09.542
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

22:09.583 --> 22:12.792
I USED TO GO TO CHURCH
EVERY SUNDAY WITH MY DADDY.

22:12.834 --> 22:16.041
I'D SIT ON HIS LAP
AND DAYDREAM THROUGH MOST OF IT,

22:16.083 --> 22:19.041
BUT... WHAT GOT MY ATTENTION
WEEK IN AND WEEK OUT

22:19.083 --> 22:20.917
WAS THE PASTOR'S SERMON.

22:20.959 --> 22:23.166
NOW HE'D BANG ON
ABOUT THIS OR THAT,

22:23.208 --> 22:26.375
BUT IT ALWAYS CAME BACK
TO ONE THING...

22:26.417 --> 22:29.166
GOOD...

22:29.208 --> 22:31.125
AND EVIL...

22:31.166 --> 22:34.375
HOW THE RIGHTEOUS
NEED TO SEE EVIL

22:34.417 --> 22:38.542
AND RESIST IT
WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.834
IT SCARED ME,

22:42.875 --> 22:45.041
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING...

22:45.083 --> 22:47.041
COMFORTING ABOUT IT,

22:47.083 --> 22:49.333
ABOUT HOW BLACK-AND-WHITE
IT SEEMED.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.792
YEAH.

22:50.834 --> 22:53.583
BUT YOU GET OLDER,
AND YOU REALIZE...

22:53.625 --> 22:56.041
IT'S NOT BLACK-AND-WHITE
AT ALL...

22:56.083 --> 23:01.041
PICKING OUT WHAT'S RIGHT
FROM WHAT'S WRONG...

23:01.083 --> 23:03.000
DECIDING WHERE TO DRAW
THAT LINE.

23:04.834 --> 23:07.583
I UNDERSTAND, CHARLOTTE,

23:07.625 --> 23:09.208
I DO,

23:09.250 --> 23:12.208
YOU WANTING TO SEE HIM DEAD
FOR--FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

23:12.250 --> 23:15.417
BUT... I THINK YOU NEED
TO ASK YOURSELF,

23:15.458 --> 23:17.417
IF THE ONLY WAY
THAT CAN HAPPEN

23:17.458 --> 23:19.417
IS YOU HAVING A HAND IN IT,

23:19.458 --> 23:22.583
IS THAT GONNA BRING YOU PEACE
OR... MORE TORMENT?

23:22.625 --> 23:24.041
(exhales)

23:24.083 --> 23:26.375
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?

23:26.417 --> 23:28.375
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN'T,
BUT, UH...

23:28.417 --> 23:31.041
I JUST...

23:31.083 --> 23:33.375
YOU KNOW THAT MAN
WHO KILLED DELL

23:33.417 --> 23:36.583
AND ALMOST KILLED MAYA
AND OLIVIA?

23:36.625 --> 23:38.583
I JUST HAD THIS INSTINCT

23:38.625 --> 23:41.166
THAT THE ONLY WAY
THAT I WAS GONNA BE ABLE

23:41.208 --> 23:44.083
TO LET GO OF ALL THE ANGER
I FELT...

23:44.125 --> 23:46.041
WAS TO FORGIVE HIM.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.250
(door opens)

23:48.291 --> 23:50.208
SO...

23:50.250 --> 23:53.041
THE BLEEDING IN MR. McHENRY'S
LUNGS IS UNDER CONTROL,

23:53.083 --> 23:55.291
AND HIS RESPIRATORY FUNCTION
IS BACK TO NORMAL.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.917
IF HE'S GONNA HAVE ANY CHANCE,
I CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER

23:57.959 --> 24:00.125
BEFORE REMOVING THE KNIFE.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.375
DO IT.

24:10.125 --> 24:12.291
ARE YOU SURE?

24:12.333 --> 24:14.625
DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO
TO SAVE HIM.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.667
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
SOME PRESSURE.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.667
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:29.709 --> 24:32.041
IT FEELS WEIRD.

24:32.083 --> 24:35.375
THIS IS THE WORST PART.

24:37.166 --> 24:41.333
I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK
I'LL BE A GOOD MOTHER.

24:45.542 --> 24:48.250
RAISING A BABY...

24:48.291 --> 24:50.291
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU CAN SEE.

24:50.333 --> 24:54.083
BUT TRYING TO DO IT
WHEN YOU CAN'T, ALONE...

24:54.125 --> 24:57.083
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE
OUT THERE WHO CAN SEE,

24:57.125 --> 24:59.208
AND THEY'RE STILL
TERRIBLE PARENTS.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.000
THEY IGNORE THEIR KIDS.
THEY MISTREAT THEM.

25:07.959 --> 25:10.041
I'VE HAD A LOT OF CHALLENGES

25:10.083 --> 25:12.041
IN MY LIFE ALREADY,
DR. SHEPHERD.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.917
MOSTLY ONES I DIDN'T WANT.

25:13.959 --> 25:16.041
BUT NOW, HAVING NATASHA,

25:16.083 --> 25:20.917
SHE IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME
THAN ANYTHING.

25:20.959 --> 25:25.250
AND I PROMISE YOU,
I WILL MAKE IT WORK.

25:25.291 --> 25:29.500
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
I WILL MAKE IT WORK.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.208
(surgical team
speaking indistinctly)

25:37.250 --> 25:39.458
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

25:39.500 --> 25:41.041
I'M NOT CRAZY.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.041
NO ONE SAID YOU WERE.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.625
AND EVERYTHING YOU'RE FEELING
IS JUSTIFIED--

25:45.667 --> 25:48.458
THE ANGER AND THE FRUSTRATION--
BUT YOU CAN'T ACT ON IT.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.458
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND LEE--

25:50.500 --> 25:54.041
THE CAPACITY TO CONTROL
YOUR EMOTIONS.
IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT
IN THE ABSTRACT.

25:54.083 --> 25:57.000
BUT TO SEE THAT MAN AND KNOW
WHAT HE DID TO CHARLOTTE...

25:57.041 --> 25:59.500
YOU'RE WRONG.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

25:59.542 --> 26:03.041
I KNOW IT FEELS RIGHT,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.083
SAM.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.667
PLEASE.
CHARLOTTE ASKED ME
TO SAVE HIM.

26:06.709 --> 26:08.792
AND I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.041
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.
THE D.A. WON'T PROSECUTE HIM.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.083
COOPER--
I'M NOT SAYING
DON'T GO IN THERE.

26:14.125 --> 26:17.083
I'M SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LET HIM COME OUT.
DO YOU THINK THAT IT
MAKES ME HAPPY

26:17.125 --> 26:20.417
TO HAVE TO GO IN THERE
AND TRY TO SAVE THAT GUY?

26:20.458 --> 26:22.417
DO YOU? WE TOOK AN OATH.

26:22.458 --> 26:26.041
SCREW THE OATH. HE RAPED
CHARLOTTE. HE RAPED HER.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.458
AND HE DESERVES SO MUCH WORSE
THAN ANYTHING YOU OR I

26:29.500 --> 26:31.417
COULD EVER DO.

26:31.458 --> 26:35.625
IF WE CROSS THAT LINE--
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME,
IT'S NOW.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.125
THEN WHAT, COOPER?
WHERE DOES IT STOP?

26:38.166 --> 26:40.250
LOOK, I-I KNOW THAT YOU
CAN RATIONALIZE THIS

26:40.291 --> 26:44.041
JUST LIKE I HAVE, ADDISON,
PETE, THE ENTIRE PRACTICE.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.083
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

26:46.125 --> 26:49.041
ALL THE RATIONALIZATION DOESN'T
MAKE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.542
IT'S WRONG.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.875
TO LET A MAN DIE,
NO MATTER HOW BAD HE IS,

26:53.917 --> 26:56.000
IT'S WRONG.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.542
YOU'RE RIGHT, SAM. THIS...

27:01.583 --> 27:04.000
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

27:08.709 --> 27:11.709
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:14.208 --> 27:17.291
HOW'S BIZZY HOLDING UP?

27:17.333 --> 27:19.500
NO WAY TO TELL.

27:19.542 --> 27:21.792
AND YOU?

27:21.834 --> 27:24.291
I AM...

27:24.333 --> 27:27.041
I AM NOT...

27:27.083 --> 27:28.667
HOLDING UP.

27:28.709 --> 27:30.333
(sighs)

27:30.375 --> 27:35.041
YOU DID...
THE RIGHT THING, ADDISON.

27:35.083 --> 27:37.291
THEN WHY DOESN'T IT
FEEL THAT WAY?

27:37.333 --> 27:40.291
WELL, I HAVEN'T KNOWN
YOUR MOTHER VERY LONG,

27:40.333 --> 27:43.834
BUT SHE SEEMS LIKE
A HARD WOMAN TO PLEASE.

27:43.875 --> 27:46.000
IMPOSSIBLE.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.291
THEN WHY DO YOU KEEP TRYING?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.500
BECAUSE SHE'S MY MOTHER.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.041
AND I GUESS...

27:53.083 --> 27:55.041
SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN,

27:55.083 --> 27:59.000
THERE'S THAT INSTINCT
TO PLEASE...

27:59.041 --> 28:01.417
THE IDEA THAT...

28:01.458 --> 28:03.333
YOU'LL GET SOMETHING BACK.

28:03.375 --> 28:06.083
I CAN'T LET THAT GO.

28:06.125 --> 28:07.917
(sighs) IS THAT CRAZY?

28:07.959 --> 28:10.625
NO.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.709
THAT'S LOVE.

28:14.375 --> 28:16.792
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:16.834 --> 28:18.208
OKAY, LET'S GO.

28:20.375 --> 28:21.917
WAIT.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.166
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE,

28:35.208 --> 28:37.041
IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT,

28:37.083 --> 28:38.875
THE LAST IMAGE YOU HAVE

28:38.917 --> 28:41.208
WAS OF ME.

28:47.750 --> 28:49.834
(door opens)

28:57.208 --> 29:00.291
(sighs)

29:00.333 --> 29:03.083
(knock on door)

29:03.125 --> 29:04.291
HI.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.041
SORRY. I'M...

29:06.083 --> 29:08.041
MY NAME'S NANCY.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.375
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.834
LOOK, I-I DON'T WANT
TO BOTHER YOU, BUT...

29:14.625 --> 29:16.667
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

29:16.709 --> 29:18.667
I DON'T KNOW.

29:18.709 --> 29:21.041
BUT THIS DOCTOR
WORKING ON HIM, IS HE GOOD?

29:21.083 --> 29:23.000
HE'S THE BEST.

29:27.959 --> 29:29.417
IS THIS...

29:29.458 --> 29:31.959
IS THIS WHERE IT HAPPENED?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.083
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE DID TO ME?

29:35.125 --> 29:36.792
LEE TOLD ME.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.000
THIS IS WHERE IT HAPPENED.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.583
I'M SORRY.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.792
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SORRY FOR,

29:52.834 --> 29:55.333
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND
RAPED ME...

29:55.375 --> 29:57.959
THAT YOU'RE TOO WEAK
TO LEAVE HIM...

29:58.000 --> 30:00.583
THAT THE MALE ROLE MODEL
IN YOUR SON'S LIFE

30:00.625 --> 30:03.959
IS A VIOLENT PREDATOR?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.166
WHAT?

30:05.208 --> 30:07.792
I'M SORRY.

30:07.834 --> 30:10.250
I AM.

30:10.291 --> 30:12.291
BUT I LOVE HIM.

30:13.834 --> 30:15.792
(crying) DO YOU KNOW
HOW HORRIBLE IT IS

30:15.834 --> 30:17.709
TO LOVE SOMEONE LIKE THIS?

30:17.750 --> 30:20.041
NO.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.125
WITH ME...

30:22.166 --> 30:25.041
WITH OUR BOY...

30:25.083 --> 30:28.625
LEE CAN BE GENTLE AND SWEET
WHEN HE WANTS TO BE.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.959
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.959
YOU CAN KID YOURSELF, NANCY.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.792
BUT YOU AND LEE,

30:34.834 --> 30:36.959
IT'S GONNA END BADLY.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.333
SO THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU GOT TWO CHOICES.

30:40.375 --> 30:43.500
YOU COULD TRY TO PUT HIM
IN THE GROUND AGAIN,

30:43.542 --> 30:45.333
WHICH IS WHAT HE DESERVES.

30:45.375 --> 30:49.583
BUT GIVEN WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN
FOR YOU AND YOUR BOY...

30:49.625 --> 30:51.667
YOU HAVE TO RUN.

30:53.083 --> 30:56.000
TAKE YOUR BOY AND RUN.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.083
(door opens)

31:01.125 --> 31:02.625
(inhales deeply)

31:02.667 --> 31:04.041
(door closes)

31:04.083 --> 31:05.333
(exhales)

31:05.375 --> 31:08.792
(Janet)
WILL WE KNOW RIGHT AWAY?

31:08.834 --> 31:10.875
AS SOON AS THE BANDAGES
COME OFF.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.166
TAKE YOUR TIME.

31:19.208 --> 31:22.375
JUST OPEN YOUR EYES, SLOWLY.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.875
(gasps)

31:32.917 --> 31:35.208
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

31:38.083 --> 31:39.875
GRAY...

31:39.917 --> 31:41.250
WALLS.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.792
(laughs)

31:45.834 --> 31:47.917
AND YELLOW CURTAINS.

31:47.959 --> 31:51.041
I--THE ROOM.
I SEE EVERYTHING.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.041
YOUR TURQUOISE SCRUB CAP.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.041
(laughs)

31:55.083 --> 31:57.250
CONGRATULATIONS.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.041
AND THANK YOU.

31:59.083 --> 32:03.417
YOU'RE A MIRACLE WORKER,
DR. SHEPHERD.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.458
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, LIZZIE,

32:07.500 --> 32:10.709
AND NATASHA.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.083
EXCUSE ME.

32:13.125 --> 32:16.041
JANET, WAIT.
OH.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.458
(sniffling)

32:17.500 --> 32:19.333
JANET, WAIT.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.333
(crying) I'M SORRY.

32:21.375 --> 32:23.333
YOU--YOU MUST THINK
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON,

32:23.375 --> 32:26.041
CRYING BECAUSE LIZZIE GOT
HER EYESIGHT BACK.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.625
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.834
(sobs) IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.417
ERIC WAS
SUPPOSED TO COME HOME.

32:33.458 --> 32:35.041
(crying)

32:35.083 --> 32:38.291
THEN HE WOULD FALL IN LOVE,
AND I'D GAIN A DAUGHTER...

32:38.333 --> 32:41.792
AND... WE'D DANCE
AT THE--AT THE WEDDING,

32:41.834 --> 32:45.500
AND... THEN THERE'D BE
GRAND--

32:45.542 --> 32:48.709
THERE'D BE GRANDCHILDREN,

32:48.750 --> 32:52.125
AND I'D BE THERE FOR THEM.

32:52.166 --> 32:56.000
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE
LIKE THIS.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.834
(sighs)

33:00.875 --> 33:02.291
SHE'S DEVASTATED.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.542
IMAGINE HOW UPSET
SHE WOULD BE

33:05.583 --> 33:08.250
IF SHE KNEW
THAT YOU LIED TO HER.

33:08.291 --> 33:10.917
MY TURQUOISE SCRUB CAP?
REALLY?

33:10.959 --> 33:12.375
WHEN THE BANDAGE CAME OFF,

33:12.417 --> 33:14.792
HER PUPIL DID NOT REACT
TO THE BRIGHT LIGHTS.

33:14.834 --> 33:16.333

HOPING THE SURGERY WOULD WORK.

33:25.166 --> 33:26.750

33:26.792 --> 33:29.000
THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP
LIZZIE AND NATASHA TOGETHER

33:29.041 --> 33:31.041
WAS TO CONVINCE JANET
SHE COULD SEE AGAIN.
