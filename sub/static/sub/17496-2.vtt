WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:05.242
Previously on Mars.

00:06.121 --> 00:07.492
We knew Mars wouldn't welcome us

00:07.492 --> 00:09.621
with open arms.

00:09.621 --> 00:12.332
Warning, systems offline.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.952
Permission to
switch from primary to backup.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.742
Do it.

00:19.742 --> 00:22.032
Prepare for retropropulsion.

00:23.371 --> 00:26.532
We were ready to
give everything to get there.

00:27.911 --> 00:29.821
Mission Control,
this is Daedalus,

00:29.821 --> 00:31.492
we're looking at a red planet.

00:33.582 --> 00:35.371
And we knew
we'd have to fight even harder

00:35.371 --> 00:36.701
if we wanted to stay.

00:36.701 --> 00:38.332
How far did we overshoot?

00:38.332 --> 00:41.451
75.3 kilometers.

00:41.451 --> 00:43.491
Mission
Control confirmed the rover

00:43.491 --> 00:46.161
is 2,000 kilos over
maximum payload.

00:46.161 --> 00:48.621
The odds are we won't make it.

00:48.621 --> 00:50.332
But no matter what happened,

00:50.332 --> 00:53.371
we'd do everything we could
to make the workshop module

00:53.371 --> 00:56.031
our new basecamp.

00:56.031 --> 00:58.661
Because the thing
that kept us pushing,

00:58.661 --> 01:02.371
it wasn't just inside us.

01:04.950 --> 01:07.621
Our species has always
been driven to build beyond

01:07.621 --> 01:11.162
what we know.

01:11.162 --> 01:15.912
We migrated across all of earth.

01:15.912 --> 01:20.581
Created settlements,
constructed cities,

01:20.581 --> 01:24.031
and when we finally
left our home planet,

01:24.031 --> 01:26.531
we knew the risks involved.

01:26.531 --> 01:29.162
As we set sail,

01:29.162 --> 01:34.912
we ask God's blessing
on the most hazardous and

01:34.912 --> 01:38.371
dangerous and greatest
adventure on which

01:38.412 --> 01:42.741
man has ever embarked.

01:42.741 --> 01:47.912
However will
is a double edged sword.

01:48.871 --> 01:51.281
Again, and again it's taken
us farther than we ever

01:51.281 --> 01:53.991
thought we could go.

01:53.991 --> 01:57.371
But this time we had seized
on an object so vast,

01:57.371 --> 02:01.662
so difficult to attain.

02:01.662 --> 02:03.201
I couldn't help but
wonder if we might have

02:03.201 --> 02:06.121
finally pushed too far.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074

02:27.122 --> 02:31.451
A.I. guidance is good.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.822
We keep this pace,

02:32.822 --> 02:36.581
we'll be there in a
little under 15 hours.

02:38.241 --> 02:42.162
<i>It's a lot of
work this space thing.</i>

02:42.162 --> 02:45.241
<i>Is it worth it?</i>

02:45.241 --> 02:49.331
Did you?

02:51.781 --> 02:54.241
Ben, are you okay?

02:54.281 --> 02:58.701
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:00.412 --> 03:01.912
We're gonna have a lot
of work to do when we get

03:01.912 --> 03:04.241
to base camp.

03:04.241 --> 03:05.662
I packed
the blanket substrate from

03:05.662 --> 03:07.991
the secondary panels...

03:20.282 --> 03:22.912
Ben!

05:18.451 --> 05:19.822
No, no no, no, no,

05:19.822 --> 05:21.411
you're having
difficulty breathing.

05:21.411 --> 05:23.372
I'm OK.

05:23.372 --> 05:26.411
You are not OK.

05:26.411 --> 05:27.951
Your
blood oxygen is dropping and

05:27.951 --> 05:31.492
your heart rate is too high.

05:32.911 --> 05:35.242
You knew.

05:35.242 --> 05:38.411
You knew, and you wouldn't
let Amelie examine you.

05:38.411 --> 05:40.242
We didn't have enough time.

05:40.242 --> 05:42.492
I think you've
got blood in your lungs.

05:42.492 --> 05:46.161
You need aspiration to get
it out and I can't treat you

05:46.161 --> 05:50.161
without the equipment
at basecamp.

05:50.781 --> 05:52.992
We've gotta drive faster.

05:52.992 --> 05:54.951
The rover
isn't designed to do more than

05:54.951 --> 05:57.281
ten kilometers per hour.

05:57.281 --> 05:59.411
If I
adjust the software protocols

05:59.411 --> 06:03.161
I can push that to twenty,
but with the terrain between

06:03.161 --> 06:09.372
us and base camp,
it's gonna be a rocky ride.

06:09.372 --> 06:11.281
Ben...

06:11.281 --> 06:13.622
I don't want this
vehicle going over fifteen,

06:13.622 --> 06:16.201
do you understand me?

06:16.201 --> 06:20.281
Got that, captain.

06:20.281 --> 06:23.122
Someone modified the
rover's speed protocols.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.781
I've got them pushing
12 kilometers per hour

06:24.781 --> 06:26.031
and climbing.

06:26.031 --> 06:27.331
What the hell are they doing?

06:27.331 --> 06:29.331
It's Ben, play it.

06:29.331 --> 06:31.331
Cueing rover audio feed now.

06:31.331 --> 06:32.701
Bringing satellite up.

06:32.701 --> 06:34.781
Sawyer's biometrics
coming online.

06:34.781 --> 06:36.531
Your blood
oxygen is dropping and your

06:36.531 --> 06:37.951
heart rate is too high.

06:37.951 --> 06:39.992
I think you've got
blood in your lungs.

06:39.992 --> 06:43.331
I can't treat you without
the equipment at basecamp.

06:43.331 --> 06:46.701
We've gotta drive faster.

06:47.201 --> 06:49.122
There were people
who asked us why we wanted to

06:49.122 --> 06:52.281
go to this place that
would almost surely kill us.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.781
And whether anything we
did to prepare ourselves

06:54.822 --> 06:57.281
would be enough.

07:01.072 --> 07:02.911
Humanity
has never undertaken anything

07:02.911 --> 07:05.872
like sending humans
to another planet.

07:05.872 --> 07:09.242
So how do humans get
ready to go to Mars?

07:09.242 --> 07:13.951
Or how do they survive
for this mission?

07:16.242 --> 07:18.242
Now last month we launched a new

07:18.242 --> 07:20.581
spacecraft as part of a
reenergized space program that

07:20.581 --> 07:24.072
will send American astronauts
to Mars and in two months,

07:24.072 --> 07:26.661
to prepare us for
those missions,

07:26.661 --> 07:31.242
Scott Kelly will begin
a year long stay in space.

07:31.242 --> 07:35.661
So good luck, captain,
we're proud of you.

07:39.531 --> 07:41.451
An American
astronaut is hours away from

07:41.451 --> 07:43.911
beginning his one
year mission on board the

07:43.911 --> 07:45.872
International Space Station...

07:45.911 --> 07:48.531
While Scott is
in space, his twin brother,

07:48.531 --> 07:51.581
former shuttle commander
Mark Kelly will stay on earth,

07:51.581 --> 07:55.451
the brothers, perfect
subjects to study...

07:56.451 --> 07:59.242
The trip to Mars
is a long trip, seven months,

07:59.242 --> 08:01.951
and so we have to understand,
what does it mean for an

08:01.992 --> 08:05.492
astronaut to be in orbit
for that amount of time.

08:08.701 --> 08:13.661
Pretty much any system in the body you
can think of is affected from space flight.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.122
The cardiovascular
system is affected.

08:16.122 --> 08:18.122
The muscular system is affected.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.492
The immune system is affected.

08:20.492 --> 08:25.451
Lots of things can go wrong
the longer you'll spend in space.

08:25.451 --> 08:27.492
Frankly we
don't have very much data about

08:27.492 --> 08:30.581
exactly what twelve months
is gonna do to Scott's body.

08:30.581 --> 08:32.822
It's an unknown, and
you're basically allowing

08:32.822 --> 08:36.662
yourself to be an experiment.

08:39.912 --> 08:41.662
It could cost him his life.

08:41.662 --> 08:45.371
This mission could
cost him his life.

08:45.371 --> 08:47.241
Ready for the launch,

08:47.241 --> 08:50.331
we are ready for the launch.

08:50.331 --> 08:52.412
I'm a test pilot, so,

08:52.412 --> 08:56.032
I think it's important
to push the envelope.

08:56.412 --> 08:58.121
We're waving
goodbye one last time,

08:58.121 --> 09:00.032
before they're loaded in.

09:00.032 --> 09:03.782
The risk factor
of this, which is high,

09:03.782 --> 09:08.072
makes it even more interesting.

09:12.662 --> 09:14.951
The engines igniting,

09:18.282 --> 09:20.451
ramping up...

09:23.201 --> 09:26.701
and liftoff.

09:27.331 --> 09:30.282
The year in space starts now,
Kelly, Kornienko, Padlanka

09:30.282 --> 09:35.701
on their way towards the
International Space Station.

09:43.162 --> 09:47.491
Going to Mars,
not only will people become

09:47.491 --> 09:52.162
invested in the safety and
well-being of the explorers,

09:52.162 --> 09:58.991
but also there is that drama,
that sense of suspense,

09:58.991 --> 10:04.662
as to whether or not they
can survive on a world

10:04.662 --> 10:08.581
that they were not made for.

10:16.822 --> 10:19.282
Who is Ben Sawyer?

10:19.282 --> 10:21.782
Ben Sawyer is our commander.

10:23.162 --> 10:25.412
Ben is
probably the most reliable

10:25.412 --> 10:27.951
person I've ever met.

10:27.951 --> 10:31.451
Ben is the eye of the storm.

10:32.201 --> 10:34.032
He is a rock.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.532
Ben Sawyer
is a great commander and

10:36.532 --> 10:40.371
I'm blessed and privileged
to be one of his team.

10:41.072 --> 10:43.951
Ask him.

10:43.951 --> 10:45.782
Who is Ben Sawyer?

10:45.782 --> 10:50.991
Uh, he is a member of the team.

11:02.581 --> 11:05.121
How far?

11:05.451 --> 11:09.201
21 down, 43 miles left.

11:17.782 --> 11:22.032
Ben, hey, are you with us?

11:22.581 --> 11:26.162
Yeah, always.

11:26.662 --> 11:30.241
Hang in there.

11:56.621 --> 11:58.822
Wheels five and six just locked.

11:58.822 --> 12:01.662
Suspension system compromised.

12:01.662 --> 12:03.782
Recommend visual assessment.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.201
The problem is in the rear.

12:05.201 --> 12:08.412
I'll get out there.

12:27.782 --> 12:31.621
OK, I'm here.

12:34.991 --> 12:37.201
We snapped a load
supporting strut above the

12:37.201 --> 12:40.371
third wheel-set.

12:40.371 --> 12:42.201
Can we weld it?

12:42.201 --> 12:44.532
No chance.

12:44.532 --> 12:48.331
Alpha-one-alpha is split,
the whole rocker is blown.

12:51.072 --> 12:52.822
Repercussion report on damage

12:52.822 --> 12:55.822
to load supporting
strut alpha-one-alpha.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.871
Replacement
component required for

12:57.871 --> 12:59.912
restoration of mobility...

12:59.912 --> 13:05.072
necessary 3D printer
is at the new base camp.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.662
We're
still 16.2 kilometers away.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.241
I really
need to treat Ben with the

13:09.241 --> 13:10.822
equipment at the workshop.

13:10.871 --> 13:13.201
We have to walk.

13:13.201 --> 13:15.871
It's minus-35 degrees.

13:15.871 --> 13:19.032
It will be
minus-70 by nightfall.

13:19.072 --> 13:22.072
We run out of battery,
we freeze to death out there.

13:22.072 --> 13:24.532
If we walk at a decent pace then

13:24.532 --> 13:28.121
we can make it to
base camp in four hours.

13:28.121 --> 13:29.951
Loading the rover took time,

13:29.951 --> 13:31.951
our batteries are
already down to

13:31.951 --> 13:33.621
four-and-a-half hours charging.

13:33.621 --> 13:37.701
No, it's too tight a margin.

13:37.701 --> 13:42.741
I'm not risking that
exposure to my crew.

13:42.741 --> 13:44.581
We charge the suits
and we leave when

13:44.581 --> 13:45.912
they're at capacity.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.282
If you don't get to base camp,

13:47.282 --> 13:49.822
then you'll suffocate before
those batteries are charged...

13:49.822 --> 13:51.412
I said we charge the...

13:56.412 --> 13:57.951
We don't have a choice.

13:57.951 --> 14:00.412
If you think
ordering us to stay in this

14:00.412 --> 14:04.282
rover to watch you die
is the right thing to do,

14:04.282 --> 14:09.371
you shouldn't be giving orders.

14:16.331 --> 14:18.331
Send a status
update to Mission Control.

14:18.331 --> 14:19.951
Tell them we'll be
out of contact until we

14:19.951 --> 14:23.991
reach the base camp.

14:32.323 --> 14:34.533
The funny thing about Mars,

14:34.533 --> 14:37.823
you know, it rotates
once in about 24 hours.

14:37.823 --> 14:41.533
It has seasons,
it has polar ice caps.

14:42.073 --> 14:46.533
So on the informational
surface it feels like earth.

14:46.533 --> 14:48.903
But you dig a little
deeper and you realize it's

14:48.903 --> 14:51.994
very cold there,
it's very dry there;

14:51.994 --> 14:55.153
you can't breathe the air.

14:55.153 --> 15:00.443
It is more hostile to life
than any place on earth.

15:00.443 --> 15:02.494
The hottest
it gets on Mars is about

15:02.494 --> 15:04.153
0 degrees Celsius.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.783
And that's like high
noon in the summer time

15:06.783 --> 15:08.494
on the Equator.

15:08.494 --> 15:13.153
But at night it will get
as low as minus 100 Celsius.

15:18.403 --> 15:21.364
There is a
fundamental problem that we're

15:21.403 --> 15:24.403
going to have to deal with
in terms of a Mars mission

15:24.403 --> 15:27.573
that was never the case
with the Apollo program,

15:27.573 --> 15:30.283
and that is the
human body and how do we

15:30.283 --> 15:32.033
protect it for long,

15:32.033 --> 15:36.783
long periods in space
and on the planet's surface.

15:37.614 --> 15:40.823
We are exceptionally
fragile creatures.

15:40.823 --> 15:43.823
We are very well evolved
to survive at sea level,

15:43.823 --> 15:49.364
on this planet and nowhere else.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.443
In the
absence of gravity lots of

15:52.443 --> 15:55.573
things can go wrong.

15:55.573 --> 15:57.744
Your heart doesn't have
to work as hard and so it

15:57.744 --> 16:01.153
becomes less effective.
Your brain has challenges,

16:01.153 --> 16:03.903
controls your movements.
The body seems to be

16:03.953 --> 16:07.903
demineralizing your bones.
These are all very important

16:07.903 --> 16:11.443
to study, not just because
academically we wanna know,

16:11.443 --> 16:14.494
but because we wanna make sure
that they're good to go when

16:14.494 --> 16:17.903
they hit the surface of Mars.

16:18.783 --> 16:20.364
So the physical challenges of

16:20.364 --> 16:22.244
getting to Mars is
gonna be fun, right,

16:22.244 --> 16:24.443
you've been in a zero
gravity environment for some

16:24.443 --> 16:27.864
eight months which is like
being in bed for eight months,

16:27.864 --> 16:31.573
and then you reach
the surface of Mars.

16:33.153 --> 16:35.903
Your coordination,
your cardiovascular system,

16:35.953 --> 16:39.114
your respiratory system,
all of that is all of a sudden

16:39.114 --> 16:42.614
under a gravitational load
that was never there and

16:42.614 --> 16:47.033
so the question is will
you be able to survive during

16:47.033 --> 16:50.864
this crucial time of arrival?

16:53.864 --> 16:58.533
If we don't succeed,

16:58.823 --> 17:02.533
then we will have tried.

17:03.494 --> 17:05.153
For the last seven months,

17:05.153 --> 17:06.953
Daedalus had been our armor,

17:06.953 --> 17:10.574
shielding us from
the harms of our journey,

17:10.574 --> 17:12.864
now we had nothing
but our E.V.A. suits to

17:12.864 --> 17:17.534
insulate us on the trip ahead.

17:21.034 --> 17:24.324
We're
still 16.2 kilometers away.

17:24.324 --> 17:26.574
We have to walk.

17:26.574 --> 17:29.243
It's minus-35 degrees.

17:29.243 --> 17:32.653
It will be minus-70
by nightfall.

17:32.653 --> 17:36.743
We run out of battery,
we freeze to death out there.

17:36.993 --> 17:40.284
Jesus.

17:57.193 --> 17:59.403
Easy, easy.

17:59.403 --> 18:00.743
We're not moving fast enough.

18:00.743 --> 18:04.703
We can't stop.

18:04.703 --> 18:08.403
We're
averaging 3 kilometers per hour.

18:09.574 --> 18:11.403
Ben, we can slow it down,

18:11.403 --> 18:13.614
let you catch your breath.

18:13.614 --> 18:17.074
No we can't.

18:17.074 --> 18:19.114
We have to move faster.

18:19.114 --> 18:20.953
We wanna make it by nightfall,

18:20.953 --> 18:23.074
we're gonna have to
reroute across the dunes.

18:23.074 --> 18:24.614
He's right.

18:24.653 --> 18:29.324
OK, OK, alright, come on.

19:36.324 --> 19:39.493
Ben?

20:05.034 --> 20:08.614
One, two, three!

20:38.653 --> 20:40.653
Battery report.

20:40.653 --> 20:45.114
21% power remaining,
advise return to climate

20:45.114 --> 20:47.493
controlled environment.

21:38.784 --> 21:42.284
Oh my god, Ben, Ben!

21:42.993 --> 21:46.074
Ben, Ben!

22:03.246 --> 22:05.115
He's the type of guy that you'll

22:05.115 --> 22:09.786
really never know until
you're close to him.

22:11.036 --> 22:14.695
He has a sense of humor.

22:14.695 --> 22:17.695
You know, going a day
without him cracking a joke

22:17.695 --> 22:21.576
it's kind of like you
haven't said something that

22:21.576 --> 22:25.445
made me laugh
today. What's up?

22:25.955 --> 22:27.405
I think
some people are genetically

22:27.405 --> 22:29.615
programmed to want to
go somewhere to leave

22:29.615 --> 22:32.996
their home and explore.

22:32.996 --> 22:35.955
You know you have to
be very comfortable,

22:35.955 --> 22:40.955
losing that connection
to those you've left behind.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.536
The type of
person that you select to go

22:45.536 --> 22:51.365
to Mars has to have a family
that understands the risk.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.905
My wife stayed home,

22:54.905 --> 22:58.076
hoping that I would not
fall into some tragedy that

22:58.115 --> 23:00.576
I couldn't get out of,

23:00.576 --> 23:07.076
you have to have mental
attitude of being prepared

23:07.076 --> 23:11.445
that something is
going to happen.

23:11.445 --> 23:14.905
When I think about
space explorers I think of

23:14.905 --> 23:20.115
their willingness to be so
heart wrenchingly torn from

23:20.115 --> 23:25.326
the earth and everyone they
love and everyone they know,

23:25.326 --> 23:30.076
to go and do impossible things.

23:33.655 --> 23:35.615
I wonder if you could tell me a

23:35.615 --> 23:37.286
little bit about your father?

23:37.286 --> 23:39.865
When I was a
child my father and I would,

23:39.865 --> 23:46.326
would uh, build little models
of the solar system and he

23:46.365 --> 23:50.155
taught me all about the
stars and taught me how to

23:50.155 --> 23:54.036
find my way by the stars.

23:54.036 --> 23:56.205
I don't know, right from then

23:56.246 --> 23:59.955
I always wanted to
be up there, you know?

24:58.115 --> 25:03.865
Entering auxiliary mode
thermoregulation deprioritized,

25:03.865 --> 25:06.536
please return to a climate
controlled environment

25:06.536 --> 25:12.205
and charge suit immediately.

25:17.076 --> 25:20.365
I don't want
matrix, I want position.

25:20.365 --> 25:22.826
How much longer
before we hear something?

25:22.826 --> 25:24.905
Including the
delay and if they'd kept

25:24.905 --> 25:26.536
their projected pace.

25:26.536 --> 25:28.036
They should
have arrived at base camp

25:28.036 --> 25:29.655
over an hour ago.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.286
Their suits
would have shut down thermal

25:31.286 --> 25:34.405
regulation to prioritize
oxygen and CO2 scrubbing.

25:34.405 --> 25:36.655
The electrigel will
have some residual heat.

25:36.655 --> 25:39.576
They're in full night.

25:39.576 --> 25:43.076
Without power,
they're gonna freeze out there.

25:54.326 --> 25:55.655
Ben, Ben?

25:55.655 --> 25:56.655
Stop.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.905
Ben, Ben?

25:58.905 --> 26:02.865
He can't hear me, Hana,
you're in command now.

26:08.826 --> 26:11.615
We've gotta keep moving.

26:11.615 --> 26:13.286
It's gotta be close.

26:13.286 --> 26:15.996
We're moving, let's go.

26:29.865 --> 26:34.955
How long till visual?

26:34.955 --> 26:37.115
Satellites are
still out of range. Audio and

26:37.115 --> 26:38.955
visual contact with crew
is not possible until they

26:38.955 --> 26:42.405
reach the workshop module.

26:50.496 --> 26:52.786
We should see a beacon by now.

26:52.786 --> 26:56.536
Horizon's closer
here, we're in a valley.

26:56.536 --> 26:57.996
I can't remember any songs...

26:57.996 --> 26:59.246
It's gotta be here.

26:59.246 --> 27:00.905
Can anyone remember a song?

27:00.905 --> 27:04.246
We can't stop guys,

27:04.246 --> 27:05.826
we can't afford to stop.

27:05.826 --> 27:07.205
Stay with me Ben.

27:07.205 --> 27:10.865
Warning, your
battery power is at 2%.

27:10.865 --> 27:13.655
CO2 scrubbing is
now compromised.

27:13.655 --> 27:17.996
The air is going toxic.

27:22.865 --> 27:26.115
My vision is fading.

27:26.115 --> 27:29.445
One more hill, hurry.

27:30.405 --> 27:34.655
You're doing
great Ben, you're doing great.

27:35.365 --> 27:38.576
We're not very far.

27:38.576 --> 27:42.365
We're gonna make it Ben,
we're gonna make it.

27:43.695 --> 27:47.036
We're not very far.

27:57.786 --> 27:59.786
If you try
to draw the solar system

27:59.786 --> 28:03.496
on a piece of paper, the
planets will be microscopic.

28:05.826 --> 28:08.905
The only way you can
get a sense of the scale

28:08.905 --> 28:12.865
is to build a model.

28:14.615 --> 28:18.536
It's a lot of work
this space thing.

28:18.536 --> 28:21.695
Was it worth it?

28:24.246 --> 28:26.445
He can't breathe!

28:26.445 --> 28:28.246
Where is the workshop?

28:28.246 --> 28:30.246
It's there!

28:30.246 --> 28:31.615
Ah, come on.

28:31.615 --> 28:33.786
We need to work fast.

28:33.786 --> 28:35.615
Come on!

28:35.615 --> 28:39.996
Fast, get him in!

28:44.326 --> 28:47.576
Pressurization complete.

28:54.746 --> 28:57.115
Javier,
pull his helmet and back pad

28:57.115 --> 28:59.955
very gently.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.286
Plug in his biometrics.

29:02.286 --> 29:05.155
We'll worry about
the infection later.

29:05.155 --> 29:07.955
Get me the monitor
and two large pour IVs.

29:07.955 --> 29:11.655
I'm cutting the Kevlar
to expose his torso.

29:15.655 --> 29:20.536
I can
see his heart rate climbing.

29:21.365 --> 29:24.286
Dammit Ben there is blood in his

29:24.286 --> 29:27.445
left lung and pleural space!

29:27.445 --> 29:30.405
Get me a chest tube;
we need to drain this now!

29:30.405 --> 29:31.576
Prepping the chest tube.

29:31.576 --> 29:33.695
Get him 100 mikes of fentanyl,

29:33.695 --> 29:34.905
he's going to feel this!

29:34.905 --> 29:36.405
Gloves.

29:36.405 --> 29:38.076
His blood pressure is too low.

29:38.076 --> 29:39.246
Scalpel.

29:39.246 --> 29:43.036
His heart is
constricted by fluid.

29:43.036 --> 29:45.655
Oxygen saturation is at 88%.

29:45.655 --> 29:47.326
Clamp...

29:47.326 --> 29:49.655
Ben...

29:49.655 --> 29:52.326
Chest tube.

29:52.326 --> 29:54.076
I'm inserting the tube now.

29:54.076 --> 29:57.205
We should see
relief with symptoms.

29:57.205 --> 29:59.036
Start suction.

29:59.036 --> 30:00.405
Show me his vitals.

30:00.405 --> 30:02.496
Stay with me!

30:02.496 --> 30:03.746
His blood
pressure is still dropping,

30:03.746 --> 30:05.155
something else is wrong!

30:05.155 --> 30:07.865
I can't feel anything
through his suit,

30:07.865 --> 30:10.786
I need to do another cut.

30:13.286 --> 30:16.326
Scalpel.

30:17.576 --> 30:19.695
His whole abdomen
is full of blood,

30:19.695 --> 30:21.445
he has ruptured his spleen.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.405
Ben, stay with me!

30:23.405 --> 30:25.155
Prep for a laparotomy.

30:25.155 --> 30:26.865
I need to clamp up
the blood supply and remove

30:26.865 --> 30:29.286
the spleen, hurry!

30:29.286 --> 30:31.405
We're not finished here Ben!

30:31.405 --> 30:33.695
Stay with me, come on!

30:33.695 --> 30:36.576
We're
losing him, we're losing him.

30:36.905 --> 30:40.076
Javier prep one millileter of...

30:54.246 --> 30:59.865
I've got them.

30:59.865 --> 31:05.036
I'm so tired
Joon, we're all so tired.

31:09.405 --> 31:12.576
He knew what he was doing.

31:12.576 --> 31:15.246
He did it because he
knew it was the best chance

31:15.246 --> 31:17.286
any of us had...

31:17.286 --> 31:21.786
I can barely believe
he's still hanging on.

31:21.786 --> 31:25.445
Blood was obliterating
the lung and pleural space

31:25.496 --> 31:28.996
in the left, diminishing lung
capacity and preventing him

31:28.996 --> 31:34.405
from properly oxygenating.

31:34.405 --> 31:40.496
After evacuation of a large
volume of blood and clot,

31:42.115 --> 31:47.205
his spleen was noted to
be extensively damaged.

31:48.695 --> 31:53.115
I was able to safely remove
it but his vital signs remain

31:53.115 --> 31:58.496
unstable and he's still
in guarded condition.

31:59.996 --> 32:05.536
He lost so much blood, Joon,

32:06.865 --> 32:12.615
it's impossible to say
now if he lives, or...

32:14.536 --> 32:19.955
the only thing is to wait....

32:46.365 --> 32:49.576
I think sending humans to space

32:49.576 --> 32:53.536
is our latest expression
of the ancient human practice

32:53.536 --> 32:56.996
called human sacrifice,

32:56.996 --> 33:01.826
but really in the service
of something much greater.

33:04.036 --> 33:06.955
The early
astronauts were risk-takers.

33:06.955 --> 33:09.746
They were brave people.

33:09.746 --> 33:13.155
They had been test pilots
and flown in the early age

33:13.155 --> 33:18.036
of the jet engines, and
more than a few of them died.

33:20.205 --> 33:22.826
Challenger
now heading downrange.

33:29.076 --> 33:34.286
Obviously a major malfunction,
we have no downlink.

33:40.695 --> 33:45.786
Sometimes
painful things like this happen,

33:45.786 --> 33:50.205
it's all part of the process
of exploration and discovery.

33:50.205 --> 33:53.286
The future doesn't belong
to the faint hearted,

33:53.286 --> 33:56.865
it belongs to the brave.

34:19.179 --> 34:21.940
Having been up here for a year,

34:21.940 --> 34:25.309
I now realize that a year is
longer than I thought it was,

34:25.309 --> 34:30.429
cause I feel like I've
lived my whole life up here.

34:30.429 --> 34:35.179
In space I never
feel completely normal.

34:35.179 --> 34:40.230
There's always something
that is a little bit not right.

34:43.268 --> 34:45.099
These astronauts when they put

34:45.099 --> 34:47.099
themselves at risk they're
not just putting themselves

34:47.099 --> 34:50.018
at risk for the
things that we know.

34:50.018 --> 34:52.099
These people are putting
their bodies at risk in ways

34:52.099 --> 34:54.099
that we might
not ever understand.

34:54.099 --> 34:57.980
For us, and for the human race.

34:59.559 --> 35:01.389
We won't
really know what the mission

35:01.389 --> 35:03.139
has done to him for years.

35:03.139 --> 35:05.019
As we continue to
monitor him through time,

35:05.019 --> 35:07.889
and as we continue to
see how the remainder of

35:07.889 --> 35:11.349
his aging process works out.

35:12.309 --> 35:14.059
We may not know for
a long time exactly

35:14.059 --> 35:19.099
what he sacrificed.

35:22.809 --> 35:26.559
I have small worries,

35:26.559 --> 35:28.456
you know I'm at school
and someone calls me to the

35:28.480 --> 35:33.059
front desk it's
like, is dad okay?

35:35.559 --> 35:38.730
But I have a lot of faith
in the space program and

35:38.730 --> 35:43.599
I know they're safe,
but there's always that um,

35:43.599 --> 35:48.519
idea that you had
false hope and that there

35:48.519 --> 35:51.639
is a possibility.

35:56.849 --> 35:59.309
Okay.

36:04.179 --> 36:07.940
Here, I'll put this
headset on, hold on.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.349
How you doing?

36:09.349 --> 36:12.269
Good, how are you doing?

36:12.269 --> 36:15.230
You don't look very excited.

36:17.389 --> 36:18.429
Of course I miss him.

36:20.019 --> 36:21.690
I miss him.

36:21.690 --> 36:24.429
I just don't know how
to show that I miss him.

36:24.429 --> 36:27.059
Watching movies with him
and just kind of hanging out.

36:27.059 --> 36:30.769
It's like the things that
don't seem important at the

36:30.769 --> 36:33.429
time, but when it comes
down to them being gone

36:33.429 --> 36:36.179
you realize they're
the most important.

36:36.179 --> 36:37.639
I saw your report card.

36:37.639 --> 36:39.059
Yeah.

36:39.059 --> 36:40.480
It was pretty good.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.809
You've gotta do better
in Spanish, though.

36:42.809 --> 36:45.980
Yeah, I know.

36:45.980 --> 36:50.480
I don't like other languages,
and it's just hard.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.059
Languages
are just hard to learn,

36:53.059 --> 36:56.730
cause I've been studying
Russian for like, I don't know,

36:56.730 --> 37:01.940
18 years and there's no secret,
it's just hard work.

37:07.849 --> 37:09.309
For the last year of my life,

37:09.309 --> 37:13.769
he has missed me growing
about four inches taller,

37:13.769 --> 37:17.559
me going into a new
school, new friends.

37:17.559 --> 37:20.230
A lot.

37:20.230 --> 37:26.230
You know, he's sacrificing
time on earth and life,

37:26.230 --> 37:29.690
in a sense.

37:30.179 --> 37:31.889
Next time I see you Charlotte,

37:31.889 --> 37:34.179
you'll be at the bottom
of the steps when I get

37:34.179 --> 37:35.940
off the airplane.

37:35.940 --> 37:38.519
Yep, the
first thing I'm gonna do when

37:38.519 --> 37:40.389
I see him is I'm gonna
give him a giant bear hug

37:40.389 --> 37:41.940
because that's what
he wants me to do.

37:41.940 --> 37:43.940
I don't
want the one-armed half hug.

37:43.940 --> 37:46.519
I want, I want
the big bear hug...

37:46.519 --> 37:48.519
both arms.

37:48.519 --> 37:50.179
Two arms all the way around

37:50.179 --> 37:51.559
and squeeze him.

37:51.559 --> 37:53.559
Yeah, just like that.

37:53.559 --> 37:55.230
He's like planned it out

37:55.230 --> 37:58.519
for me, everything.

38:04.309 --> 38:06.309
Mikhail Korniyenko, Scott Kelly,

38:06.309 --> 38:10.519
Sergei Volkov on their way home.

38:12.139 --> 38:14.599
What is a good life that we

38:14.599 --> 38:17.980
should aspire to?

38:17.980 --> 38:23.480
Is a good life
one that is enjoyed

38:23.519 --> 38:27.099
with pleasure and
without risk or is a

38:27.099 --> 38:32.389
good life one that has a
chance to achieve great deeds?

38:45.349 --> 38:47.269
There's
the immediate risk of the

38:47.269 --> 38:49.099
rocket blowing up.

38:49.099 --> 38:51.349
It's kinda like going over
Niagara Falls in a barrel,

38:51.349 --> 38:55.599
while you're on fire.

38:55.599 --> 38:58.019
As soon as you realize
you're not gonna die it's

38:58.019 --> 39:03.690
the most fun you've ever had.

39:24.389 --> 39:27.639
We have to go to Mars.

39:32.690 --> 39:36.059
It'll require more
sacrifice, more radiation,

39:36.059 --> 39:39.599
more risk, more time away.

39:49.019 --> 39:52.230
I'd still do it, though.

39:56.730 --> 40:00.269
I will miss my sister,

40:04.179 --> 40:07.980
and I'll be worried that
she's worried about me.

40:22.179 --> 40:25.429
I'm sorry, sir.

40:38.230 --> 40:41.230
I didn't hire
you because I was convinced

40:41.230 --> 40:45.639
you could keep your feelings
separate from this mission.

40:45.639 --> 40:49.730
I hired you because
I knew you couldn't.

40:49.730 --> 40:54.309
Cause I needed someone who
understands what I understand.

40:58.389 --> 41:04.980
For something like this to
work, it has to be personal.

43:46.139 --> 43:48.889
We dream.

43:48.889 --> 43:52.480
It's who we are.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.019
Down to our bones, our cells.

44:04.519 --> 44:07.099
We'd come tens of
millions of kilometers

44:07.099 --> 44:09.809
through the darkness.

44:09.809 --> 44:14.980
All of us prepared to
sacrifice everything.

44:17.139 --> 44:22.480
Because we knew that
making a home in this place

44:22.480 --> 44:27.809
was the only chance humanity
had to go on dreaming.

44:33.849 --> 44:39.059
I thought I'd find you up here.

45:18.059 --> 45:21.980
Farewell.

45:30.690 --> 45:34.980
He was gone.

45:35.690 --> 45:38.639
I was in command now.

45:40.940 --> 45:44.179
With Ben's strength to guide us,

45:44.230 --> 45:45.940
we had made the
longest journey in the

45:45.940 --> 45:50.730
history of humankind.

45:50.730 --> 45:56.349
And I knew we had even
further to go without him.
