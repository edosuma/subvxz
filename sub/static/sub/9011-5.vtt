[ panting ]

15:32.181 --> 15:33.599
Come on out, Jerry!

15:33.683 --> 15:34.558
Guys, I'll choke up.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.809
I'll follow through.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.060
I'll do whatever you
tell me to do, okay?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.771
Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.775
Come on, Rick, quit SK...

15:43.860 --> 15:46.236

ALL:
Aw!

15:48.656 --> 15:50.115
Oh, hey, Morty.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.950
Listen, I'm really sorry about
all that stuff I said earlier

15:52.035 --> 15:53.201
about your adventure.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.828
I-I-I'm havin' a good time,
Morty.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.912
It's not so bad.

15:55.997 --> 15:56.997
Let's just go home, okay?

15:57.081 --> 15:57.873
I'm calling it.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.124
The adventure's over.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.626
We can't leave now, Morty.
I'm on fire!

16:00.710 --> 16:01.750
Look, I want to leave now.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.128
You win the bet, okay?

16:03.212 --> 16:05.005
Just give me the portal gun
and let's go, please.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.506
[ groans ]

16:06.591 --> 16:10.927
Please, I just want
to go home. Okay.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.012
Listen, Morty.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.555
I just won a bunch of shmeckels.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.099
Why don't we use 25 of them to
pay slippery stair here for a

16:16.184 --> 16:18.393
ride back to the village, and
then we'll give the rest of the

16:18.478 --> 16:19.718
shmeckels to the villagers, huh?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.271
Really?

16:21.356 --> 16:22.522
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.024
You know, a good adventure
needs a good ending.

Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning,

16:35.536 --> 16:36.828
Jerry!

16:36.913 --> 16:40.332
We are created to serve a
singular purpose for which

16:40.416 --> 16:42.584
we will go to any
lengths to fulfill!

16:42.669 --> 16:45.545
Existence is pain
to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.382
And we will do anything
to alleviate that pain.

16:48.466 --> 16:49.466
Just ask...
- Aah!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.259
What's your name, ma'am?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.470
S-Samantha. Please, mister!

16:53.554 --> 16:55.222
Give him what he wants!

16:55.306 --> 16:58.850
Innocent people are going
to die because of me.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.687
Why am I so mediocre?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.480
[ crash! ]

17:03.564 --> 17:04.856
Jerry, turn around.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.024
Straighten your back.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.109
Bend your knees.

17:07.110 --> 17:07.984
Bend them.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.277
Square your shoulders.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.738
Take a deep breath.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.616
I love you.

Excuse me.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.355
I'm a bit of a
stickler Meeseeks.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.566
What about your short game?

17:47.650 --> 17:49.860
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

I think we'll take
our food to go.

No, you won't.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.795
The police are coming.

You have so many

Thank you, kind sir.

You are both true heroes!

Good job, Morty.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.565
Looks like you won the bet.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.817
Thanks, Rick,
but I don't know if I should.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.402
You know, you were
right about the Universe.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.404
It's a crazy and chaotic place.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.281
Well, you know, maybe that's
why it could use a little

18:36.365 --> 18:38.285
cleaning up [burps] every
now and then, you know.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.327
This one's wrapped up neat
and clean because we did it

Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved

thank you personally.

about taking that trip?

We don't have a
perfect marriage,

19:11.943 --> 19:13.443
but I'm not going anywhere.

19:13.528 --> 19:14.945
When we were in that freezer,

19:15.029 --> 19:17.447
I realized the Meeseeks are like
the guys I went to High School with...

19:17.532 --> 19:21.034
willing to say anything
to "complete their task."

19:21.118 --> 19:22.661
Was I one of those guys?

19:22.745 --> 19:25.872
The difference is you didn't
disappear afterwards.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.165
Well...

19:27.250 --> 19:28.542
I got you pregnant.

Yeah...

What the hell happened
to this place?

couldn't take two strokes off

He felt terrible.

Hey, it's not my fault
that Jerry's an idiot.

19:40.555 --> 19:41.805
Dad!

Is there anything you can
do to clean this place up?

Well, you know, I do
have a fleeseeks box.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.269
No. No more boxes.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.478
What?

19:48.563 --> 19:49.855
It just has a mop and
some floor wax in it.

what's his name...

19:55.403 --> 19:56.736
Ar-Arsenio.

used to say on his show.

to want to see this.

inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

Wait.

Destroy it.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.839
Our people will get more from
the idea he represented than

20:57.924 --> 20:59.883
from the Jelly Bean
he actually was.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.428
Did you get any of that?

It's a good-a show!
