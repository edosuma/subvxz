- What?
- See, tonight was...

40:44.609 --> 40:46.403
a big deal for my parents.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.863
And I didn't want to unload
on them,

40:47.946 --> 40:50.240
because then they'd be worried
about me.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.825
And I didn't want to unload
on Jorge

40:51.908 --> 40:54.119
because it was a huge night
for him.

40:54.202 --> 40:57.164
So I just decided to put on
my brave Lily face

40:57.247 --> 40:58.248
and get through the night.

41:00.041 --> 41:04.379
But now the night's over,
and I feel like garbage.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.673
So, as my friend,
will you hold me while I cry

41:06.756 --> 41:07.924
and not make it weird?

41:10.468 --> 41:11.928
Reel it in.

41:12.012 --> 41:14.014
[sobbing]

41:24.608 --> 41:26.610
[sniffles]

41:35.535 --> 41:38.079
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

41:38.163 --> 41:40.457
I feel so much better.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.209
Thank you.

41:42.292 --> 41:43.627
Good night.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.004
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.548
I got to... I got to ask
a follow-up.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.009
What's going on with you?

41:51.092 --> 41:53.094
[sighs]

41:54.262 --> 41:56.056
Just an existential crisis

41:56.139 --> 41:58.475
where I realize
I've never been in love.

41:58.558 --> 42:00.227
Oh, shit.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.770
Yeah.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.022
- It's a real kick in the tit.
- [chuckles]

42:04.105 --> 42:06.816
'Cause I've seen it around me
my whole life.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.151
I know what it looks like.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.572
It's swatting a taquito
out of someone's hand

42:12.656 --> 42:14.908
because they have
high cholesterol.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.994
It's cooking for 45 relatives,
most of whom you don't like.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.832
It's listening to music you hate

42:22.916 --> 42:25.460
because you like watching
that person dance.

42:26.503 --> 42:30.131
It's all the little things
that make up one big feeling.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.969
An "I can't live without you"
kind of love.

42:35.512 --> 42:37.722
I want it.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.724
I want to give it.

42:39.808 --> 42:42.852
I want to get it.

42:42.936 --> 42:45.438
And I want it now.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.525
Fuck, I want to kiss you
right now.

42:48.608 --> 42:50.694
Do it.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.408
[breathing heavily]

42:59.244 --> 43:01.246
[Nick moaning softly]

43:06.918 --> 43:08.169
Mm. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

43:08.253 --> 43:10.213
- Oh, yeah.
- Just to be clear,

43:10.297 --> 43:11.840
you know I don't want all that
love stuff with you, right?

43:11.923 --> 43:12.966
- Yeah, totally, totally. Cool.
- Okay.
