00:40.984 --> 00:44.488
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

00:44.488 --> 00:47.324
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

00:47.324 --> 00:51.161
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

00:51.161 --> 00:54.998
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

00:54.998 --> 00:58.835
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.422
Taxi!

02:27.924 --> 02:29.926
Taxi, taxi!

02:31.928 --> 02:34.264
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

02:48.195 --> 02:50.197
Taxi! Taxi!

02:53.200 --> 02:55.202
Can you give me a hand?

03:13.470 --> 03:16.223
Uh, Escherstrausse.

03:16.223 --> 03:19.476
- Was?
- Escherstrausse.

03:19.476 --> 03:21.478
Was?

03:25.732 --> 03:28.485
Ah, Escherstrausse.

03:28.985 --> 03:30.821
Ja, ja.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.542
Has it been raining this hard for long?

04:30.547 --> 04:33.800
Half an hour.

05:41.952 --> 05:44.454
Can you wait a minute, please?

06:04.224 --> 06:06.226
- Hello?
- Who is it?

06:06.226 --> 06:09.730
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

06:10.230 --> 06:13.233
- I don't know you. Go away!
- But I have the letter you sent.

06:13.233 --> 06:16.737
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

06:16.737 --> 06:19.239
- Go away. Go away!
- But you don't understand!

06:21.742 --> 06:25.245
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

06:28.248 --> 06:30.751
Hello. Is anybody there?

06:30.751 --> 06:32.753
Hello?

07:50.580 --> 07:55.085
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

07:55.585 --> 07:58.588
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

07:58.588 --> 08:01.591
- I'm going away forever.
- Oh, big deal, kid.

08:01.591 --> 08:04.094
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

08:04.594 --> 08:08.098
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

08:08.098 --> 08:11.601
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

08:12.018 --> 08:13.854
Well, then?

08:13.854 --> 08:16.356
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

08:16.356 --> 08:18.358
You wouldn't understand.

08:18.358 --> 08:20.861
It all seems so... Absurd,

08:21.361 --> 08:22.863
So fantastic.

08:23.363 --> 08:28.785
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

08:28.869 --> 08:31.872
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

08:31.872 --> 08:34.291
No, of course not. Go ahead.

08:56.813 --> 08:59.316
Hey, why don't you close it?

09:02.319 --> 09:05.322
That's better. It was just the wind.

09:06.823 --> 09:09.326
You sure are in bad shape.

09:09.659 --> 09:12.662
You have to tell me all about it.

09:12.662 --> 09:16.666
The wind! The windows burst open.

09:16.666 --> 09:20.170
- I got scared.
- No. That's not it.

09:20.670 --> 09:23.673
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

09:27.677 --> 09:30.680
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

11:49.736 --> 11:52.155
Let me in! Pat!

11:54.908 --> 11:56.910
Pat! Pat!

12:00.914 --> 12:05.001
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

12:06.753 --> 12:11.675
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

12:18.515 --> 12:21.017
Help me! Help!

12:21.435 --> 12:23.437
No! No! No!

12:36.783 --> 12:39.286
Help me!

12:48.295 --> 12:50.297
Help!

12:54.384 --> 12:57.554
There's a murderer!

13:18.158 --> 13:21.411
No!

15:14.941 --> 15:17.444
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

15:17.444 --> 15:19.446
Good morning, miss Tanner.

15:22.366 --> 15:25.369
- Good morning. May I help you?
- Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

15:25.869 --> 15:28.372
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that...

15:28.372 --> 15:30.874
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

15:30.874 --> 15:33.877
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

15:33.877 --> 15:36.380
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.883
- Who said that to you?
- I don't know. She didn't say her name.

15:39.883 --> 15:42.886
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

15:42.886 --> 15:47.391
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

15:47.391 --> 15:49.393
Nice to meet you.

15:49.393 --> 15:52.396
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

15:52.396 --> 15:54.398
Our vice directress.

15:54.398 --> 15:56.400
She was a very famous ballerina.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.402
- Madame Blanc?
- Yes?

15:58.735 --> 16:01.738
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

16:01.988 --> 16:03.490
Oh, yes.

16:05.992 --> 16:08.412
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Of course, madame.

16:08.912 --> 16:14.418
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

16:14.418 --> 16:18.922
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

16:18.922 --> 16:21.925
- She's my aunt.
- Good! She's a marvelous woman,

16:21.925 --> 16:24.428
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

16:24.428 --> 16:27.931
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

16:28.014 --> 16:31.017
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

16:31.518 --> 16:33.520
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.023
- She's traveling abroad.
- Thank you.

16:36.023 --> 16:40.027
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

16:40.027 --> 16:43.030
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.032
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

16:45.532 --> 16:47.534
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

16:47.534 --> 16:50.537
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

16:50.537 --> 16:55.542
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

16:55.542 --> 16:59.796
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

16:59.796 --> 17:02.299
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

17:02.299 --> 17:04.800
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

17:05.218 --> 17:08.805
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

17:08.805 --> 17:10.807
- Just a slight hitch.
- Yes, but don't worry.

17:11.308 --> 17:15.311
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

17:15.311 --> 17:18.815
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

17:18.815 --> 17:21.818
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

17:21.818 --> 17:25.321
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

17:25.821 --> 17:31.328
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

17:31.328 --> 17:34.331
She really is an invaluable teacher.

17:34.748 --> 17:38.752
- Come with me.
- And now, gentlemen...

17:38.752 --> 17:42.005
As you know, our courses last three years,

17:42.005 --> 17:44.508
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

17:45.008 --> 17:47.511
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

17:47.511 --> 17:51.515
- That's my information.
- Excuse me.

17:51.515 --> 17:55.018
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

17:55.018 --> 17:58.522
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

17:58.522 --> 18:02.526
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

18:03.026 --> 18:07.030
- What did she do?
- I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

18:07.030 --> 18:10.033
So you see? It really was 11:00.

18:10.033 --> 18:13.036
Coming?

18:13.537 --> 18:18.041
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

18:18.041 --> 18:22.045
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

18:22.045 --> 18:25.048
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

18:25.048 --> 18:27.801
He's really ugly, isn't he?
Don't be afraid to say so.

18:27.801 --> 18:30.637
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

18:30.637 --> 18:35.142
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

18:39.146 --> 18:42.149
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

18:42.149 --> 18:44.651
So he had all his teeth pulled.

18:44.651 --> 18:47.654
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

18:47.654 --> 18:49.656
Bang.

18:49.656 --> 18:52.159
- Where are we going?
- To the locker room.

18:52.159 --> 18:55.662
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

18:59.082 --> 19:03.587
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

19:03.587 --> 19:06.590
- Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
- Who said that? Shut up.

19:06.590 --> 19:09.092
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

19:09.092 --> 19:13.096
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

19:13.096 --> 19:17.100
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls... Miriam, for one.

19:17.601 --> 19:20.103
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Your locker's over there.

19:20.103 --> 19:22.606
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

19:22.606 --> 19:26.610
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

19:26.610 --> 19:30.614
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

19:31.615 --> 19:33.617
Come with me.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.629
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

19:49.132 --> 19:52.135
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

19:52.135 --> 19:54.137
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

19:54.137 --> 19:57.140
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

19:57.140 --> 19:59.643
- Yeah.
- In advance.

19:59.643 --> 20:02.145
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not... Oh...

20:02.145 --> 20:06.149
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

20:09.152 --> 20:11.154
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

20:11.154 --> 20:14.157
- Yes. Me.
- Oh, thank you.

20:14.157 --> 20:17.160
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.163
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

20:20.163 --> 20:22.165
I just need a pair for today.

20:22.666 --> 20:24.167
But if you'd rather not...

20:24.668 --> 20:27.170
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

20:27.170 --> 20:30.173
- But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
- Of course.

20:34.678 --> 20:37.180
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

20:37.180 --> 20:39.182
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

20:44.187 --> 20:47.190
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

20:47.190 --> 20:49.192
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

20:49.693 --> 20:51.695
Same with me at first.

20:51.695 --> 20:54.197
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

21:00.704 --> 21:02.706
I once read that names...

21:02.706 --> 21:06.209
Which begin With the letter "S"...

21:06.209 --> 21:08.712
Are the names of snakes.

21:14.885 --> 21:16.887
Next year, after I finish the course,

21:16.887 --> 21:19.890
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

21:19.890 --> 21:22.893
What about you?

21:22.893 --> 21:26.897
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

21:27.898 --> 21:30.400
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.402
- Like it?
- Uh-huh.

21:32.402 --> 21:36.907
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

21:36.907 --> 21:38.909
Even if I have the name of a snake?

21:38.909 --> 21:40.911
I was just kidding.

21:40.911 --> 21:43.413
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

21:43.413 --> 21:45.916
No.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.922
Hello?

21:51.922 --> 21:54.925
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

21:54.925 --> 21:56.927
You did the right thing.

21:58.428 --> 22:00.430
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.683
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

22:02.683 --> 22:05.185
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

22:05.686 --> 22:07.688
I thought you might be needing them.

22:07.688 --> 22:09.690
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

22:10.691 --> 22:14.194
- Anyway, thanks a lot.
- Oh, no. It's nothing.

22:14.695 --> 22:16.697
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

22:16.697 --> 22:19.700
- Don't you want to stay for a while?
- No, thanks. I can't.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.704
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

22:23.704 --> 22:25.706
- I have to.
- Just for a minute?

22:25.706 --> 22:28.208
No, no, really. I have to be going.

22:28.208 --> 22:31.211
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

22:31.211 --> 22:35.716
- Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
- Well, ciao.

22:35.716 --> 22:38.218
See you tomorrow.

22:38.218 --> 22:40.220
Bye.

22:40.220 --> 22:42.222
No, go on.

22:44.224 --> 22:46.226
Uh-huh, I know.

22:46.727 --> 22:50.230
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

22:50.731 --> 22:52.232
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

22:52.733 --> 22:55.235
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um...

22:55.235 --> 22:58.739
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

22:58.739 --> 23:01.241
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

23:01.241 --> 23:03.744
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

23:03.744 --> 23:06.747
Sure.

23:06.747 --> 23:08.749
I got it. Okay.

23:08.749 --> 23:11.752
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

23:11.752 --> 23:14.087
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

23:14.087 --> 23:16.590
Anyway, he is cute.

23:16.590 --> 23:19.593
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

23:20.594 --> 23:23.597
That poor kid, ending up like that.

23:23.597 --> 23:26.099
I can't even think about it.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.602
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

23:29.102 --> 23:31.605
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

23:31.605 --> 23:34.107
She was acting very strange.

23:34.608 --> 23:36.109
Mumbling to herself.

23:36.610 --> 23:41.782
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

23:43.283 --> 23:46.787
- There was so much noise.
- God, was she difficult.

23:46.787 --> 23:49.289
She was saying things that made no sense.

23:49.289 --> 23:52.793
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

23:53.043 --> 23:56.046
"Secret."

23:56.296 --> 23:58.799
"Iris."

23:58.799 --> 24:00.300
What?

24:02.803 --> 24:04.805
Uh, I remember...

24:04.805 --> 24:06.807
She mentioned the word "secret."

24:07.307 --> 24:10.811
And then she... Mentioned a flower...

24:10.811 --> 24:12.813
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

24:12.813 --> 24:15.315
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

24:15.315 --> 24:18.318
I don't know. She was a busybody.

24:18.318 --> 24:22.322
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

24:52.269 --> 24:55.272
- How do you like it at Olga's?
- It's nice.

24:55.272 --> 24:59.276
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

25:02.779 --> 25:05.282
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

25:05.282 --> 25:08.285
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- I've got good news for you.

25:08.285 --> 25:11.288
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

25:11.788 --> 25:14.291
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

25:14.791 --> 25:16.793
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

25:17.294 --> 25:19.296
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

25:19.296 --> 25:22.299
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

25:22.299 --> 25:25.302
- I know, but...
- The room is free now.

25:25.302 --> 25:28.805
- Well, I didn't think it was so important.
- As you wish.

25:28.805 --> 25:31.308
If that's what you want, so be it.

25:43.820 --> 25:45.822
Sara?

25:48.825 --> 25:51.828
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

25:51.828 --> 25:54.831
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

25:54.831 --> 25:57.334
Nothing will change it for you.

25:57.334 --> 25:59.336
My compliments.

26:40.961 --> 26:42.879
Witch!

27:40.771 --> 27:43.273
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

27:43.774 --> 27:46.276
The technique of classical ballet...

27:46.276 --> 27:49.780
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

27:51.281 --> 27:53.784
All right. Let's warm up.

27:54.284 --> 27:56.787
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

27:56.787 --> 28:00.290
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

28:00.290 --> 28:02.793
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

28:02.793 --> 28:04.795
And now some exercises.

28:04.795 --> 28:07.798
Daniel, you may begin.

28:12.969 --> 28:16.973
One, two, three and four.

28:16.973 --> 28:19.476
And one and two...

28:19.476 --> 28:21.978
And three and four.

28:22.062 --> 28:23.563
And one and two...

28:24.064 --> 28:25.565
And three and four.

28:26.066 --> 28:27.567
- And one...
- I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

28:28.068 --> 28:31.071
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

28:31.071 --> 28:34.324
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

28:34.324 --> 28:36.827
This is the first time we've worked together.

28:37.327 --> 28:39.830
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

28:40.330 --> 28:43.834
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

28:44.084 --> 28:46.586
Daniel?

28:46.586 --> 28:49.589
All together now.

28:52.592 --> 28:54.594
And one and two...

28:54.594 --> 28:57.597
And three and four.

28:59.099 --> 29:02.102
- I can't. Please.
- And one and two...

29:02.102 --> 29:04.104
And three and four.

29:04.604 --> 29:09.609
And one and two and three and four.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.864
And one and two and three and four.

29:13.864 --> 29:18.118
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

29:19.619 --> 29:24.541
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and...

29:24.541 --> 29:27.627
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

29:27.627 --> 29:30.130
And three and four.

29:30.130 --> 29:34.134
And one and two and three and four.

30:04.831 --> 30:07.334
Come on. Come on. Run along.

30:07.334 --> 30:09.836
Come on. Drink up.

30:09.836 --> 30:12.839
- Oh, you... You must drink.
- No, that's enough.

30:12.839 --> 30:15.342
You heard what the doctor said.

30:15.342 --> 30:17.844
- Drink up.
- No.

30:17.844 --> 30:19.846
You must drink.

30:19.930 --> 30:22.933
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

30:22.933 --> 30:26.937
- Right, professor Verdegast?
- Obviously.

30:26.937 --> 30:29.439
My dear madame.

30:29.439 --> 30:33.443
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

30:33.443 --> 30:36.446
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

30:36.446 --> 30:39.449
- Uh, better.
- The fault lies with your exercises.

30:39.950 --> 30:44.955
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

30:44.955 --> 30:46.957
Thus the hemorrhaging.

30:47.457 --> 30:50.961
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

30:50.961 --> 30:52.963
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, yes. She looks much better.

30:53.463 --> 30:54.965
- Ow!
- Hold still.

30:55.465 --> 30:58.468
This will get you back into shape in no time.

30:59.970 --> 31:04.474
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

31:07.477 --> 31:11.481
- Who brought my bags here?
- Olga. What a dear.

31:11.481 --> 31:14.484
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

31:14.985 --> 31:18.488
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

31:18.488 --> 31:21.491
Why... Why did she do that?

31:21.491 --> 31:24.494
- If I wanted to, I would...
- Well, my dear,

31:24.494 --> 31:27.497
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

31:27.497 --> 31:31.001
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

31:31.001 --> 31:33.503
You can telephone me.

31:33.503 --> 31:37.007
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

31:37.507 --> 31:39.509
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

31:40.010 --> 31:42.012
- A drop of vin rose?
- Yes.

31:42.012 --> 31:45.515
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

31:45.515 --> 31:49.019
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

31:49.519 --> 31:53.023
Rest well. You're in good hands.

32:16.797 --> 32:20.300
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.303
So, you moved in here.

32:23.303 --> 32:26.306
Well, they moved me in here.

32:26.306 --> 32:28.308
I really didn't want to.

32:28.809 --> 32:31.812
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

32:31.812 --> 32:33.814
And threw me out of her place.

32:33.814 --> 32:37.317
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

32:38.819 --> 32:42.322
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

32:42.322 --> 32:45.325
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

32:45.325 --> 32:47.828
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

32:47.828 --> 32:51.331
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

32:51.331 --> 32:54.835
- And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
- Verdegast?

32:54.835 --> 32:56.837
- He came to look at you?
- Yeah.

32:56.837 --> 32:59.339
Come in.

33:01.842 --> 33:03.844
Hi, Pavlos.

33:14.771 --> 33:16.773
Thank you.

33:18.775 --> 33:21.778
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

33:21.778 --> 33:23.780
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

33:23.780 --> 33:25.782
At least you know.

33:25.782 --> 33:29.786
- Are you eating up here?
- Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

33:29.786 --> 33:32.789
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

33:32.789 --> 33:36.793
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

33:43.133 --> 33:46.136
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

33:46.136 --> 33:48.638
I'd better change.

33:48.638 --> 33:51.641
- Ciao. See you later.
- Okay.

35:22.232 --> 35:24.234
Where? Where?

35:24.234 --> 35:26.236
Everywhere. The whole floor.

35:26.737 --> 35:29.239
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

35:29.239 --> 35:31.742
- Where are they coming from?
- I don't know! Let's go and see!

35:31.742 --> 35:35.245
- They're coming from the ceiling.
- In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

35:48.425 --> 35:50.427
Don't let anyone come up.

36:45.982 --> 36:49.986
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

36:49.986 --> 36:51.988
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

36:51.988 --> 36:54.991
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

36:54.991 --> 36:57.744
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

36:58.245 --> 37:00.247
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

37:00.664 --> 37:02.165
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

37:02.666 --> 37:04.668
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

37:04.668 --> 37:07.421
- Oh, it was awful.
- Yes, one got in my mouth.

37:07.421 --> 37:11.425
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

37:11.425 --> 37:14.428
- Are the other floors all right?
- Yes. We checked them out.

37:14.428 --> 37:16.430
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

37:16.430 --> 37:19.433
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

37:19.433 --> 37:22.936
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.439
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

37:26.940 --> 37:29.443
The boys have kindly offered to help,

37:29.443 --> 37:31.945
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

37:32.446 --> 37:35.949
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.951
But it's already late,
and in any case,

37:37.951 --> 37:39.953
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.289
We'll all sleep together.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.792
- Bravo.
- You all right?

37:45.792 --> 37:48.295
- Yes, thank you.
- Fine.

37:48.795 --> 37:50.797
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

37:51.298 --> 37:52.799
- Good.
- Are you all right?

37:53.300 --> 37:54.801
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

37:55.302 --> 37:57.804
- Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
- Good.

37:58.305 --> 38:00.307
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

38:00.807 --> 38:02.809
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

38:03.310 --> 38:05.812
Do the teachers live here at school?

38:05.812 --> 38:07.814
No, they live in town.

38:07.814 --> 38:11.318
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

38:11.485 --> 38:13.487
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

38:13.987 --> 38:16.490
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night. Good night.

38:55.696 --> 38:58.198
Is that guy hot for you?

38:58.198 --> 39:00.158
- Maybe.
- That's funny.

39:00.784 --> 39:03.078
I heard he was, uh...

39:03.078 --> 39:08.625
- Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
- That's a good one.

39:09.209 --> 39:11.211
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

39:11.211 --> 39:13.171
- You liar! That's not...
- Why don't you two shut up?

39:13.171 --> 39:15.716
Some of us want to go to sleep.

39:20.721 --> 39:24.224
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

40:45.472 --> 40:47.641
Suzy, are you asleep?

40:47.808 --> 40:50.394
- Were you sleeping?
- No. What's the matter?

40:52.396 --> 40:54.523
You hear that snoring?

40:54.523 --> 40:57.401
It's weird.

40:57.401 --> 41:00.278
Hear it?

41:00.278 --> 41:02.656
Where do you think it's coming from?

41:08.995 --> 41:12.332
Behind the sheet.

41:12.332 --> 41:14.835
Lies!

41:14.835 --> 41:16.920
What?

41:20.424 --> 41:22.426
They lied to us.

41:22.426 --> 41:24.928
The directress is here.

41:24.928 --> 41:28.432
That's her, the one who's snoring.

41:28.432 --> 41:30.934
She's the directress.

41:30.934 --> 41:33.395
- How do you know?
- I'm sure it's her.

41:36.690 --> 41:38.734
Last year, for a while,

41:38.734 --> 41:40.861
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

41:40.861 --> 41:43.030
Under the top of the stairs.

41:46.533 --> 41:48.535
One night,

41:48.535 --> 41:52.289
I heard someone coming very late in,

41:52.289 --> 41:55.459
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

41:56.543 --> 41:58.628
And then...

41:58.628 --> 42:02.215
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

42:02.215 --> 42:05.802
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

42:08.388 --> 42:10.807
Listen.

42:11.308 --> 42:13.393
You hear that whistle?

42:14.603 --> 42:17.564
It's exactly the same.

42:17.981 --> 42:21.568
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

42:21.568 --> 42:24.071
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

42:24.071 --> 42:27.074
And had slept in the room next to mine.

42:29.701 --> 42:31.244
You see?

42:31.745 --> 42:35.332
So I know she's the directress.

42:35.332 --> 42:37.334
She's here.

42:40.504 --> 42:42.506
She's there.

42:42.506 --> 42:45.592
Right behind that sheet.

43:07.864 --> 43:10.867
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

43:10.867 --> 43:13.870
- Good morning, madame Blanc.
- Good morning, Daniel.

43:14.371 --> 43:17.374
- Is everything in order now?
- All cleaned up, madame.

43:17.374 --> 43:19.876
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.882
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

43:25.882 --> 43:27.884
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

43:27.884 --> 43:30.887
- No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
- Good morning.

43:31.388 --> 43:35.392
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

43:35.392 --> 43:38.895
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

43:38.895 --> 43:40.897
The second-year class in the red room.

43:40.897 --> 43:42.899
Thank you.

44:41.708 --> 44:44.211
Stop!

44:44.211 --> 44:47.214
Stop! Stop!

44:47.214 --> 44:50.217
Enough. Enough!

44:50.217 --> 44:53.220
- Do you know what happened? Do you know?
- What day is it?

44:53.220 --> 44:56.723
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

44:56.723 --> 44:58.725
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

44:59.226 --> 45:01.728
- What?
- Did you all hear that?

45:01.728 --> 45:04.731
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

45:04.731 --> 45:08.735
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

45:08.735 --> 45:12.239
- That's impossible.
- Let's go to the first-aid center.

45:12.739 --> 45:15.742
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

45:15.742 --> 45:17.744
That's enough now!

45:18.245 --> 45:21.748
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

45:21.748 --> 45:24.251
The boy must have done
something to him first!

45:24.251 --> 45:27.754
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

45:27.754 --> 45:32.259
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

45:32.259 --> 45:34.261
Stop it!

45:34.261 --> 45:36.263
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

45:36.263 --> 45:39.266
You won't allow it?

45:39.266 --> 45:41.768
Then get out! You and your dog!

45:42.269 --> 45:45.272
- Get moving!
- You bitch!

45:45.272 --> 45:47.274
Out!

45:47.274 --> 45:50.277
I'm going. I'm going.

45:50.277 --> 45:52.779
But try to understand that...

45:53.280 --> 45:56.783
That I'm blind, not deaf.

45:57.284 --> 45:59.286
Get it? Huh?

45:59.286 --> 46:01.288
Not deaf.

46:01.538 --> 46:04.041
Not deaf. You understand that?

46:04.041 --> 46:06.043
You understand?

46:08.545 --> 46:11.548
Ahh, fresh air!

46:11.548 --> 46:14.051
Let me out of this gilded parade.

46:14.551 --> 46:18.555
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

46:22.559 --> 46:26.063
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

46:50.170 --> 46:52.673
Hey, listen.

46:52.673 --> 46:56.677
There they go, right on schedule.

46:56.677 --> 46:59.179
The teachers. Remember?

47:00.180 --> 47:04.184
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

47:08.188 --> 47:10.190
You hear them?

47:12.192 --> 47:14.194
Yes.

47:18.865 --> 47:20.867
I...

47:30.877 --> 47:34.381
l... I don't think they'll
even miss school.

47:34.381 --> 47:37.384
What? What did you say?

47:37.384 --> 47:39.886
Wake up.

47:39.886 --> 47:44.391
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

47:45.892 --> 47:48.395
A front door is on the left.

47:49.896 --> 47:53.400
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

47:54.901 --> 47:57.904
Jesus, Suzy.

47:57.904 --> 47:58.905
- You're a genius.
- Mmm.

48:00.407 --> 48:02.409
Fantastic.

48:02.409 --> 48:05.829
How come I never noticed that before?

48:05.829 --> 48:10.834
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

48:11.334 --> 48:13.336
Wake up. Suzy.

48:13.336 --> 48:18.175
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

48:19.676 --> 48:22.179
I'm so sleepy.

48:22.179 --> 48:24.181
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

48:24.181 --> 48:27.184
Maybe...

48:27.184 --> 48:29.686
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

48:31.188 --> 48:35.692
Of course!
Yes.

48:39.196 --> 48:42.199
Begin to count the steps as they go.

48:59.049 --> 49:01.468
It's like the search of alietne.

52:27.758 --> 52:29.843
Easy.

52:31.345 --> 52:33.347
What is it? Huh?

52:33.347 --> 52:35.349
Come on.

52:36.850 --> 52:38.852
Come on; let's go home.

53:01.625 --> 53:04.127
Who is that? Who's there?

53:05.629 --> 53:07.798
Easy, boy.

53:13.303 --> 53:15.305
What is it?

53:17.808 --> 53:19.893
What's happening?

53:24.564 --> 53:27.025
Who's there?

53:31.488 --> 53:33.990
Who's there?

53:48.171 --> 53:50.173
Wait!

55:46.456 --> 55:49.543
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

55:49.543 --> 55:52.546
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

55:52.546 --> 55:56.049
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

55:56.049 --> 55:59.052
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

55:59.052 --> 56:01.555
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

56:01.555 --> 56:04.057
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

56:04.558 --> 56:08.562
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

56:09.062 --> 56:13.066
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- No, everything's all right.

56:13.316 --> 56:15.819
Is it something personal, dear?

56:15.819 --> 56:18.321
No, no, it's nothing like that.

56:19.823 --> 56:22.325
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

56:22.492 --> 56:24.494
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.002
Well? What is it?

56:32.502 --> 56:36.006
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

56:36.506 --> 56:39.509
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

56:39.509 --> 56:41.511
No, but it's more than that.

56:42.012 --> 56:44.514
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

56:45.015 --> 56:46.516
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

56:47.017 --> 56:49.019
He told me they had
some definite clues.

56:49.519 --> 56:52.522
- You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
- Yes, you told me that.

56:52.522 --> 56:55.984
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

56:56.526 --> 56:58.987
No, you didn't tell me that.

56:58.987 --> 57:02.532
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

57:02.532 --> 57:05.535
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

57:05.535 --> 57:08.538
I only caught two words distinctly:

57:08.538 --> 57:10.999
"Secret" and "Irises."

57:10.999 --> 57:14.544
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

57:14.544 --> 57:16.546
You've done very well. Congratulations.

57:16.546 --> 57:19.549
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

57:19.549 --> 57:22.010
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

57:22.010 --> 57:26.515
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before... hello?

57:26.723 --> 57:30.310
- You really messed things up.
- What are you talking about?

57:30.310 --> 57:33.313
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

57:33.814 --> 57:36.316
Someone just inside the building that night.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.823
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

57:49.579 --> 57:51.581
Come on.

57:54.084 --> 57:56.586
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

57:56.586 --> 57:59.589
What difference does that make to you?

57:59.589 --> 58:01.591
Big difference.

58:02.592 --> 58:05.595
Because I was Pat's friend.

58:06.096 --> 58:08.598
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

58:08.598 --> 58:12.102
She got scared and she ran away.

58:12.102 --> 58:14.604
She was in hysterics almost.

58:15.105 --> 58:17.107
And then she was killed.

58:17.107 --> 58:20.610
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

58:20.610 --> 58:23.113
Well, that was me.

59:19.169 --> 59:23.173
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

59:23.173 --> 59:25.676
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

59:25.676 --> 59:29.179
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

59:29.179 --> 59:32.683
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

59:32.683 --> 59:35.686
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

59:36.186 --> 59:39.189
I'll let you read them tonight.

59:49.866 --> 59:53.870
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

59:53.870 --> 59:57.332
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

59:57.708 --> 01:00:01.128
You understand? They disappeared.

01:00:01.128 --> 01:00:05.966
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

01:00:06.216 --> 01:00:09.219
- Wake up! Help me!
- I can't.

01:00:09.469 --> 01:00:10.971
Can't?

01:00:13.473 --> 01:00:18.478
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

01:00:18.478 --> 01:00:20.981
- Look.
- What is it?

01:00:20.981 --> 01:00:25.485
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

01:00:25.736 --> 01:00:29.740
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.744
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

01:00:33.744 --> 01:00:39.458
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

01:00:45.005 --> 01:00:48.008
Oh, no! Please!

01:00:49.468 --> 01:00:53.013
Don't leave me alone!

01:01:04.983 --> 01:01:07.986
I must get away!

01:03:04.311 --> 01:03:07.773
Wait!

01:03:28.001 --> 01:03:31.004
Wait!

01:04:03.412 --> 01:04:05.956
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:08:58.832 --> 01:09:01.710
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:04.712
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

01:09:04.712 --> 01:09:08.716
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:12.220
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.724
- You heard her leave, didn't you?
- Sara? Oh, yes.

01:09:15.724 --> 01:09:19.227
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

01:09:19.227 --> 01:09:23.231
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

01:09:23.231 --> 01:09:28.236
- But it's impossible.
- If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

01:09:28.737 --> 01:09:31.238
Why sneak off like a thief?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:45.504
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:50.008
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

01:09:50.008 --> 01:09:53.011
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:57.516
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

01:09:59.017 --> 01:10:02.020
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

01:10:02.521 --> 01:10:05.524
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

01:10:05.524 --> 01:10:10.028
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

01:10:11.029 --> 01:10:14.032
Well, I'm really worried about her.

01:10:14.032 --> 01:10:18.537
Oh, great. Where?

01:10:18.537 --> 01:10:22.040
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.544
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

01:10:25.544 --> 01:10:29.047
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

01:10:29.548 --> 01:10:32.050
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:35.679
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:52.696
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

01:10:52.696 --> 01:10:57.200
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.204
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

01:11:01.204 --> 01:11:04.207
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:08.712
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

01:11:08.712 --> 01:11:12.215
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

01:11:12.215 --> 01:11:18.221
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

01:11:18.221 --> 01:11:22.225
- Were you aware of that?
- No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

01:11:22.225 --> 01:11:26.730
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:29.232
And she came to me for treatment.

01:11:29.733 --> 01:11:33.236
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

01:11:33.236 --> 01:11:38.241
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

01:11:38.241 --> 01:11:41.244
- Not you, I hope?
- No.

01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:43.997
They were kind of wild ideas.

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:48.502
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

01:11:48.627 --> 01:11:53.131
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

01:11:53.131 --> 01:11:56.635
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

01:11:58.136 --> 01:12:02.140
- I guess you knew that?
- No. But I have a strange feeling...

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:07.646
That somebody already told me
about it... Or something similar.

01:12:07.646 --> 01:12:09.648
I can't... can't remember.

01:12:09.648 --> 01:12:13.652
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

01:12:14.027 --> 01:12:18.532
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:24.037
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

01:12:24.538 --> 01:12:29.042
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

01:12:29.543 --> 01:12:32.671
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

01:12:32.671 --> 01:12:36.675
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:40.679
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

01:12:40.679 --> 01:12:43.181
And she founded the Tam academy...

01:12:43.181 --> 01:12:48.311
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

01:12:48.311 --> 01:12:51.314
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

01:12:51.314 --> 01:12:54.317
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

01:12:54.317 --> 01:12:57.821
Madame Markos died in a fire.

01:12:57.821 --> 01:13:01.324
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

01:13:01.324 --> 01:13:06.455
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

01:13:06.455 --> 01:13:10.959
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:15.964
But what does it mean to be a witch?

01:13:16.214 --> 01:13:19.593
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

01:13:19.593 --> 01:13:24.097
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:27.601
Is part of mental illness.

01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:33.106
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

01:13:34.608 --> 01:13:37.069
Excuse me. Milius?

01:13:37.152 --> 01:13:39.654
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

01:13:40.155 --> 01:13:43.158
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

01:13:43.158 --> 01:13:45.160
It's the final word on the subject.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:49.665
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

01:13:49.665 --> 01:13:53.669
- Fraulein.
- She's interested in your favorite subject:

01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:56.171
Witches.

01:13:56.171 --> 01:13:59.675
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

01:14:01.176 --> 01:14:04.179
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

01:14:04.179 --> 01:14:06.682
Keep me posted, Hmm?

01:14:06.682 --> 01:14:09.184
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:13.689
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

01:14:13.689 --> 01:14:17.192
- Do you believe in the existence of witches?
- Ah.

01:14:17.192 --> 01:14:21.196
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

01:14:21.196 --> 01:14:24.700
- Really?
- I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.202
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

01:14:27.703 --> 01:14:30.706
Of contemporary psychiatry.

01:14:30.706 --> 01:14:32.708
You're skeptical, my dear.

01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:36.211
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

01:14:38.213 --> 01:14:43.343
- What do witches do?
- They are malefic, negative and destructive.

01:14:43.343 --> 01:14:47.848
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

01:14:48.348 --> 01:14:53.353
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

01:14:54.354 --> 01:14:57.858
- You don't believe me?
- No, I...

01:14:57.858 --> 01:15:01.361
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

01:15:01.361 --> 01:15:05.365
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

01:15:05.365 --> 01:15:08.869
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:12.873
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

01:15:15.125 --> 01:15:18.378
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

01:15:18.378 --> 01:15:21.381
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

01:15:21.381 --> 01:15:24.384
I read some stuff.

01:15:24.384 --> 01:15:27.387
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

01:15:27.888 --> 01:15:30.891
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:33.894
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

01:15:33.894 --> 01:15:35.896
A real mistress of magic.

01:15:36.271 --> 01:15:39.274
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

01:15:39.775 --> 01:15:44.279
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

01:15:44.279 --> 01:15:47.282
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

01:15:47.282 --> 01:15:50.285
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

01:15:50.786 --> 01:15:53.288
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

01:15:53.288 --> 01:15:57.292
Its strength rests with its leader...
That is, with its head.

01:15:57.292 --> 01:16:01.296
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

01:16:01.296 --> 01:16:03.799
Harmless.

01:16:04.299 --> 01:16:07.803
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

01:16:07.803 --> 01:16:10.806
But magic is ever present.

01:16:11.306 --> 01:16:14.685
In other words:

01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:22.192
Which means that magic is everywhere,

01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:25.696
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

01:16:25.696 --> 01:16:28.865
Always.

01:16:42.838 --> 01:16:45.841
Mark? Mark?

01:16:54.349 --> 01:16:57.853
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

01:16:57.853 --> 01:17:02.357
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

01:17:02.357 --> 01:17:05.360
- Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
- I don't know.

01:17:05.861 --> 01:17:09.364
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:18.373
- Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
- Suzy? Hello?

01:17:18.373 --> 01:17:20.876
- I can't...
- Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

01:17:20.876 --> 01:17:24.379
- Did something happen?
- Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

01:17:24.379 --> 01:17:27.382
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

01:17:27.382 --> 01:17:30.761
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I...

01:17:31.261 --> 01:17:34.014
Hello? Hello, Frank?

01:17:34.598 --> 01:17:37.476
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:17:37.476 --> 01:17:40.395
Frank? Hello?

01:17:40.395 --> 01:17:43.732
Hello? Hello?

01:17:43.732 --> 01:17:45.734
Hello?

01:17:47.235 --> 01:17:50.739
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:24.333
No!

01:19:28.337 --> 01:19:31.340
No!

01:21:12.858 --> 01:21:16.361
They don't leave the school at all.

01:21:16.361 --> 01:21:21.325
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

01:21:49.353 --> 01:21:54.358
Two, three, four, five, six,

01:21:54.358 --> 01:21:57.319
Seven...

01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:04.826
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

01:23:17.399 --> 01:23:19.401
Twenty.

01:24:30.639 --> 01:24:33.141
Who's there?

01:25:15.517 --> 01:25:19.354
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

01:25:37.789 --> 01:25:41.293
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

01:26:49.903 --> 01:26:52.656
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

01:26:52.656 --> 01:26:56.034
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

01:26:57.411 --> 01:27:00.414
The secret...
I saw it behind the door!

01:27:00.414 --> 01:27:03.166
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

01:29:54.921 --> 01:29:58.925
I told you: We must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

01:29:58.925 --> 01:30:04.306
Vanish... She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

01:30:07.809 --> 01:30:10.812
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

01:30:17.819 --> 01:30:21.323
Vanish... She must vanish!

01:30:21.448 --> 01:30:24.451
She must die, die, die!

01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:34.711
Helena, give me power.

01:30:48.725 --> 01:30:51.728
Sickness! Sickness!

01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:54.731
Away with her! Away with trouble!

01:30:54.731 --> 01:30:59.736
Death, death, death!

01:32:59.085 --> 01:33:01.496
Who is it? Who's there?

01:33:03.721 --> 01:33:07.225
I've been expecting you.
The American girl.

01:33:07.897 --> 01:33:09.976
I knew you'd come.

01:33:10.988 --> 01:33:14.492
You wanna kill me?
You wanna kill me Helena Markos?

01:33:29.155 --> 01:33:31.531
You wanted to kill me!
You wanted to kill me!

01:33:33.415 --> 01:33:35.126
What are you gonna do now?

01:33:42.011 --> 01:33:43.757
Now death is coming for you!

01:33:46.731 --> 01:33:50.069
You wanted to kill Helena Markos?

01:33:52.954 --> 01:33:55.959
Hell is behind that door.

01:33:56.587 --> 01:33:59.212
You're going to meet death now!

01:34:00.513 --> 01:34:02.674
The living dead!

01:37:25.914 --> 01:37:28.917
Witch, witch.
