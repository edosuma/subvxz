07:27.933 --> 07:30.332
is
Cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine.

When you want
a high-velocity explosive

07:32.333 --> 07:35.499
that's also very stable,
c-4 can't be beat.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.066
You could set it on fire

07:38.067 --> 07:40.332
You could hit with a hammer
and it wouldn't detonate.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.699
What it does take
to detonate c-4

07:42.700 --> 07:44.800
is detcord or a blasting cap.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.199
Kari: The explosion
of the blasting cap

07:48.200 --> 07:50.099
applies a really powerful shock

07:50.100 --> 07:52.766
that triggers
the c-4 explosive material.

07:52.767 --> 07:56.866
As the c-4 decomposes,
it releases a variety of gases

07:56.867 --> 08:00.832
that expand at over 26,000 feet
per second.

08:00.833 --> 08:05.199
Now, before we can find out if
you can contain that explosion,

08:05.200 --> 08:07.766
we need to find out what its
power is without containment,

08:07.767 --> 08:09.699
and for that,
we're gonna do a control.

08:17.667 --> 08:22.066
With these, burst discs
made by a company called oseco.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.699
Now, what happens
when an explosive goes off

08:24.700 --> 08:27.966
is that you have a shock wave
that propagates spherically out

08:27.967 --> 08:29.899
from the center
of the explosion.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.399
All right, so, that's 20 feet
away from the blast zone.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.899
These are calibrated
to burst at a specific psi.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.099
This one is 13 psi,

08:38.100 --> 08:39.899
which we're using
to measure injury

08:39.900 --> 08:43.199
because, remember, it's not
whether the hero lives or dies,

08:43.200 --> 08:45.666
it's whether
he walks away unscathed.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.166
and so it doesn't pose a hazard

11:20.167 --> 11:22.499
for anybody
outside the immediate area.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.566
Narrator: This is it.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.232
Gun is hot.

11:26.233 --> 11:29.066
Narrator: It's all very well
hitting a harmless Clay pigeon

11:29.067 --> 11:31.699
that's designed to float,
but how about

11:31.700 --> 11:34.533
a less-than-aerodynamic
paintball grenade?

11:37.167 --> 11:38.200
Pull!

11:40.767 --> 11:42.132
Jamie: Nice!

11:42.133 --> 11:43.367
[ Laughs ]

11:44.867 --> 11:48.467
Adam: That was the most
satisfying trapshooting ever.

11:50.567 --> 11:53.500
Well, our skeet-shooting
training paid off in spades.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.400
Pull.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.733
[ Laughs ]

12:03.067 --> 12:05.799
I was able to knock four
out of five paintball grenades

12:05.800 --> 12:07.099
right out of the sky,

12:07.100 --> 12:10.066
as evidenced by their carnage
here on my board,

12:10.067 --> 12:12.699
but a paintball grenade
doesn't kill ya...

12:12.700 --> 12:14.099
Pull.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.699
And i have no idea what,

12:15.700 --> 12:20.067
if anything, bird shot would do
to a real steel grenade.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.699
Yeah!

12:25.700 --> 12:28.600
Nonetheless, i still feel
pretty satisfied with myself.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.299
Jamie:
So, the thing is that bird shot

12:32.300 --> 12:34.099
spreads out
in this large pattern

12:34.100 --> 12:36.266
that makes the odds
relatively high

12:36.267 --> 12:39.632
you're gonna hit your target,
and on top of that, I'm betting

12:39.633 --> 12:42.966
that that bird shot's just gonna
bounce off a steel grenade.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.932
It's not gonna do anything
to it.

12:44.933 --> 12:46.799
So, what we really want to know

12:46.800 --> 12:49.599
is what the odds are of actually
hitting an incoming grenade

12:49.600 --> 12:51.866
with a single bullet,

12:51.867 --> 12:53.432
and then, of course,
what's the likelihood

12:53.433 --> 12:55.932
of you being able
to disable it, as well.

12:55.933 --> 12:57.299
Adam:
All right, sir.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.233
I'm ready.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.199
Narrator: 12 feet away
from one pound of exploding c-4

13:08.200 --> 13:10.632
will result in serious injury,

13:10.633 --> 13:12.132
but Hollywood

13:12.133 --> 13:15.532
would have us believe you
could walk away unscathed...

13:15.533 --> 13:17.166
You got this
from Jamie's office?

13:17.167 --> 13:21.066
By dropping the ticking
time bomb in a handily located,

13:21.067 --> 13:22.932
supposedly
boom-proof container....

13:22.933 --> 13:26.199
I'm trying
to find my contract right now.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.866
Narrator:
Like a filing cabinet.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.366
Okay.

13:29.367 --> 13:34.499
So, this is our same 13-psi,
injury-indicating burst disc.

13:34.500 --> 13:40.199
I don't remember agreeing
to washing Jamie's mustache.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.799
And remember,
with no containment devices,

13:42.800 --> 13:44.532
one pound of c-4

13:44.533 --> 13:47.667
caused this disc to go off
at this 12-foot range.

13:49.067 --> 13:50.299
Well, I'll be damned.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.300
I guess i have to
wash his mustache.

13:53.600 --> 13:58.066
The goal here is to see
if the containment devices

13:58.067 --> 14:00.632
serve as some kind
of protection.

14:00.633 --> 14:04.566
And to indicate that,
if this disc does not go off,

14:04.567 --> 14:07.766
then that means, you know what,
there's no injury at this range

14:07.767 --> 14:09.099
and they did their job.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.599
You're probably asking yourself,

14:10.600 --> 14:13.266
"why do you guys have these
styrofoam, cut-out blue guys?"

14:13.267 --> 14:15.532
Well,
those are our shrapnel catchers,

14:15.533 --> 14:18.666
because if the shock wave
doesn't injure you,

14:18.667 --> 14:19.833
the shrapnel might.

14:20.867 --> 14:24.766
In three, two, one!

Wow!

14:30.200 --> 14:31.567
That is a mess of paper.

It's just confetti! Pssh!

14:36.767 --> 14:39.367
All right.
Let's see if it helped.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.166
Narrator: Well, as far
as the pressure wave goes,

14:44.167 --> 14:47.099
the filing cabinet
did offer some protection.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.232
The disc at 12 feet,
the dive-to-survive zone,

14:50.233 --> 14:52.066
did not burst.

14:52.067 --> 14:55.832
Tory: Okay, so, the cabinet did
save you from the shock wave,

14:55.833 --> 14:57.466
but you're gonna be killed
by the shrapnel.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.666
I mean, look at that guy's head.
It's been ripped off.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.967
Oh, putting the bomb
in the filing cabinet...

to a bed.

Oh, i kind of want some red,
silky sheets now.

This is nice!

15:25.433 --> 15:27.599
Oh, these are fancy!

Now, you might be
asking yourself, "how would you

15:29.867 --> 15:33.166
use a bed to protect yourself
from an explosion?"

15:33.167 --> 15:35.599
Cue the dream sequence.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.799
Wait for this.
It's a little disturbing.

In three, two, one!

15:59.133 --> 16:01.667
Oh, ho!

16:04.100 --> 16:05.366
That was really interesting.

16:05.367 --> 16:07.099
All the energy went up,

16:07.100 --> 16:10.167
and i didn't see any shrapnel
go out towards the guys.

16:12.967 --> 16:15.899
I will be so shocked if
stuffing a bomb under your bed

16:15.900 --> 16:17.699
actually saves you.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.099
You've got to be kidding me.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.466
I think
we might've found something

16:21.467 --> 16:22.467
that's actually bombproof.

16:22.468 --> 16:24.566
Yeah, i mean, look.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.132
The burst discs
aren't even burst.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.732

And the shrapnel catchers?

16:28.733 --> 16:30.232
Well, they caught nothing

16:30.233 --> 16:32.666
but a gentle rain
of mattress stuffing.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.132
I'm absolutely astounded

16:34.133 --> 16:37.666
at how well the mattress worked
at both absorbing the shock wave

16:37.667 --> 16:40.532
and preventing deadly shrapnel
from hitting our guys.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.199
And if you
look at the high-speed,

16:42.200 --> 16:43.699
you'll see exactly why.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.233
All the energy
went straight up into the air.

16:55.900 --> 16:59.066
But up next
is a fish tank full of water,

16:59.067 --> 17:01.333
and that
is a totally different animal.

[ Laughs ]

17:14.567 --> 17:16.066
And, truth be told,

17:16.067 --> 17:18.366
if someone has just thrown
one of these at you

17:18.367 --> 17:19.666
and you have enough time

17:19.667 --> 17:21.799
to see it and pull a gun
to try and shoot at it...

17:21.800 --> 17:23.199
Pull.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.799
The kind of gun you're
gonna have ready access to

17:24.800 --> 17:26.299
is gonna be something like this.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.666
But unlike a shotgun,

17:28.667 --> 17:32.199
this only fires a single round,
a single piece of lead.

17:32.200 --> 17:35.666
Can you even hit this in midair
with this?

17:35.667 --> 17:37.532
Well, that's what Jamie and i
are about to try and find out.

17:37.533 --> 17:40.932
Narrator: This time, they're
using a real but inert grenade,

17:40.933 --> 17:43.299
but there's a hitch
with the gun.

can't be done safely.

17:48.167 --> 17:52.199
Hand-grenade lobber goes here.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.932
We've chosen this spot because
it's miles away from habitation,

17:55.933 --> 17:58.366
but, even so,
we're loathe to shoot anything

17:58.367 --> 18:00.866
straight up in the air
other than bird shot.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.466
And with that in mind,

18:02.467 --> 18:06.067
we've chosen paintball pistols
to do our test.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.299
Because if we can hit 'em
with those,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.267
we should be able to hit 'em
with a real pistol.

All right, sir.

Okay, here we go.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.232
Throwing the grenade in three...

18:20.233 --> 18:22.399
if they miss
with the paintball pistol,

18:22.400 --> 18:24.800
they're likely to miss
with a real one.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.899
Totally missed it.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.266
Let's try again.

18:32.267 --> 18:36.100
Narrator: The myth
is hitting its first hurdle...

18:37.867 --> 18:40.867
because Adam's certainly
not hitting any grenades.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.332
I ran out of ammo.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.199
I got close, though.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.899
Narrator:
They've proven

18:54.900 --> 18:57.767
the wide spray
of shotgun shot works.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.766
But the silver-screen scene
in question

19:01.767 --> 19:05.167
usually involves a weapon firing
a single bullet at a time.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.732
And that's...

19:09.733 --> 19:12.366

to lose hope there.

at my disposal

shooting a whole clip of rounds

of hitting it...

what happens to a grenade

when you hit it
with a real bullet?

we're gonna answer next.

inside of a fish tank.

and our shrapnel catchers.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.766

is enough
to take on one pound of c-4.

gonna happen here?

surrounded by
a 3/8-inch acrylic tank.

20:56.867 --> 21:00.766
The water is not gonna
really absorb the explosion.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.532
Rather, it's gonna transmit that

21:02.533 --> 21:05.466
out to the edges of the tank,
which is gonna shatter

21:05.467 --> 21:08.800
into a million
razor-sharp acrylic pieces.

don't see this saving anyone.

what i thought it was gonna be.

which means our hero

21:50.267 --> 21:51.867

the shock wave.

21:53.467 --> 21:55.432

pretty surprised by this result.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.199
We thought this was gonna shred,

22:07.200 --> 22:09.432
and so there'd just be frag
and shrapnel in all our guys,

22:09.433 --> 22:10.566
but that's not what happened.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.099
And it looked
like all of the energy

22:13.100 --> 22:14.666
was focused on the front

22:14.667 --> 22:16.699
and the back of the tank,
which was elevated.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.066

you might walk
away from this unscathed.

call this plausible.

22:44.467 --> 22:45.467
[ Horn honks ]

22:45.468 --> 22:46.866
Grant:
Now, what's the scenario?

22:46.867 --> 22:48.232
That's right.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.833
It's a garbage truck.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.632
Imagine this.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.366
It's early in the morning.

22:55.367 --> 22:58.066
You go to your mailbox,
and you find... what is it?

22:58.067 --> 23:00.466
A bomb!
What am i gonna do with it?

23:00.467 --> 23:02.532
Oh, i know. It's trash day.

23:02.533 --> 23:04.299
Throw it in the garbage truck.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.532
Now he has two options.

23:05.533 --> 23:08.099
He can jump away from the truck,
dive here,

23:08.100 --> 23:09.799
or he could jump off to the side

23:09.800 --> 23:11.732
and let this steel wall
protect him.

23:11.733 --> 23:13.666
Because of that, we're gonna
have two different setups.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.466
We're gonna have a shrapnel
catcher with a burst disc here

23:16.467 --> 23:18.799
and another shrapnel catcher
with a burst disc here

23:18.800 --> 23:21.867
and see whether or not this
garbage truck will protect him.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.332
Kari: All right, here we go
with one pound of c-4

23:26.333 --> 23:28.466
in the trough
of a garbage truck.

23:28.467 --> 23:32.932
In three, two, one!

23:32.933 --> 23:34.600
Fire!

23:36.567 --> 23:38.299
Grant: Oh!

23:38.300 --> 23:42.200
Yeah, that was a pretty big pop.

23:49.367 --> 23:50.932
Well, i think it's obvious

23:50.933 --> 23:52.466
you don't want to stand
behind the truck.

23:52.467 --> 23:55.399
This guy's blown to bits,
and the oseco disc is blown.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.499
All right, well,
over here on the side,

23:58.500 --> 24:00.199
looks like you'd fare
a whole lot better.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.599
In fact,
you'd survive without injury.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.167
If you jump off to the side,
you would survive.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.399
This one's looking plausible.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.633
So, plausible by proximity.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.066
Grant: So, what have
we learned from this experiment?

24:19.067 --> 24:21.066
Well,
when selecting a household item

24:21.067 --> 24:23.532
as a potential
bomb-disposal area,

24:23.533 --> 24:26.532
it's important to look at
where the energy's going to go.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.066
Completely containing all
that energy is a very bad idea,

24:30.067 --> 24:31.232
but if you find an item

24:31.233 --> 24:33.766
that can focus the energy
in one direction,

24:33.767 --> 24:36.132
like the mattress
or the aquarium

24:36.133 --> 24:38.232
or in the garbage truck

24:38.233 --> 24:41.866
and you jump away from
that direction and hit the deck,

24:41.867 --> 24:44.632
you significantly increase
your chances of survival.

24:44.633 --> 24:47.132
You guys, we're here,
we have a truck,

24:47.133 --> 24:49.499
we have experts,
and we have a lot of explosives.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.499
I say we do
this "mythbusters" style.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.099
Let's make it disappear?

24:53.100 --> 24:54.532
It's time to go boom.

24:54.533 --> 24:55.632
Man:
Fire in the hole.

24:55.633 --> 24:57.066
Fire in the hole.

24:57.067 --> 24:59.132
Fire in the hole.

24:59.133 --> 25:05.600
Five, four, three, two, one!

25:12.200 --> 25:13.666
Please, do not try what
you're about to see at home.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.132
The things that we do on this
show are extremely dangerous.

25:16.133 --> 25:18.800
We have experts to keep us safe.

25:22.067 --> 25:23.400
Pull.

25:27.133 --> 25:29.132
Jamie: We're done
with our target practice

25:29.133 --> 25:30.300
on fake grenades...

25:32.367 --> 25:34.732
so now it's time
to break out the real ones.

25:34.733 --> 25:37.532
Looks pretty innocuous,
doesn't it?

25:37.533 --> 25:40.199
It is, in fact, pretty small
compared to some of the things

25:40.200 --> 25:42.333
we've blown up over the history
of "mythbusters."

25:47.633 --> 25:52.532
But in fact, these grenades
are incredibly dangerous

25:52.533 --> 25:55.532
and have all of us and
our bomb techs quite nervous.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.532
So, in order to properly
experiment with these,

25:57.533 --> 26:00.766
we have come to a large tract
of private land in gold country,

26:00.767 --> 26:03.566
east of the "mythbusters" shop,

26:03.567 --> 26:06.566
where we have thousands
of acres of clear land

26:06.567 --> 26:11.066
all around us in order
to experiment with these.

26:11.067 --> 26:13.333
God, i love operating
the big machinery!

26:17.067 --> 26:18.499
Countless times on this show,

26:18.500 --> 26:20.532
we have armored ourselves behind
these blast chamber panels

26:20.533 --> 26:22.266
to watch
dangerous things happen,

26:22.267 --> 26:24.066
hopefully
right on the other side.

26:24.067 --> 26:25.699
Perfect. That's perfect.
I love it.

26:25.700 --> 26:28.366
But this setup,
where our blast chamber panel

26:28.367 --> 26:32.766
is bordered on both sides
by inch-thick plates of steel,

26:32.767 --> 26:34.532
this is the most armored

26:34.533 --> 26:37.766
we have ever required ourselves
to be out in the field.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.532
Narrator:
That's because it's not

26:39.533 --> 26:42.433
just an explosive pressure wave
they're dealing with.

26:43.333 --> 26:45.199
The steel body of the grenade

26:45.200 --> 26:47.866
is designed
to spray lethal fragments

26:47.867 --> 26:52.399
at over 25,000 feet per second
in every direction.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.532
And the nightmare scenario
is a misfire.

26:55.533 --> 27:00.232
To prepare for that, Jamie's
recreated his own nightmare.

cost around 100 grand or so.

for arms, a baby head,

and most importantly,
through this camera,

27:31.567 --> 27:33.432
I'll be able to see
what's going on

of our reinforced bunker.

the safety precautions,

27:43.200 --> 27:45.067
Time to wire up
a little control.

27:47.067 --> 27:49.532
Before we get to shooting guns
at these things,

27:49.533 --> 27:50.866
they have a timed fuse.

27:50.867 --> 27:53.166
All right.
Go ahead and, uh, make it go up.

27:53.167 --> 27:55.366
I.E., after you pull the pin
and release the spoon,

27:55.367 --> 27:57.932
there's a few seconds
before they blow up.

27:57.933 --> 27:59.333
How many seconds?

28:01.067 --> 28:04.466
That's what we need to determine
by blowing one up.

Blaine, the bomb tech,
pulls the pin

28:11.433 --> 28:15.632
and then traps the spoon
of the live grenade in the tube.

28:15.633 --> 28:18.099
When it's raised,
the spoon will pop...

28:18.100 --> 28:19.332
And we're hot!

28:19.333 --> 28:21.232

how long it takes a grenade

29:10.200 --> 29:12.899
The key reason for this test
was to check our timing

29:12.900 --> 29:15.599
because we need to know
how much time it takes

29:15.600 --> 29:20.066
for the grenade to go off
once the spoon pops up.

firing guns at grenades,

29:32.167 --> 29:33.366

about it,

and we think one of three things

29:35.067 --> 29:36.766
is going to happen
for each of these shots.

29:36.767 --> 29:39.566
Either the round
will render the grenade inert

29:39.567 --> 29:42.066
and maybe decimate it...
That's one.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.232
Two is,
it could actually detonate it

29:44.233 --> 29:45.832
and explode it in midair.

29:45.833 --> 29:48.199
Or three, it could bring
enough energy into the equation

29:48.200 --> 29:50.832
to actually send the grenade
back to where it came.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.166
I'm curious as to what the
result is actually going to be.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.932
Narrator: To find out,
the setup is simple.

29:55.933 --> 29:59.099
All right, then.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.299
It's been established
an oncoming grenade

30:02.300 --> 30:03.699
can be taken out,

30:03.700 --> 30:06.966
but with live ammo,
they're taking no chances.

30:06.967 --> 30:10.366
Three, two, one, go.

30:10.367 --> 30:12.599
Perfect.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.999
These are the weapons we'll be
using on our grenade today,

30:15.000 --> 30:16.866
and we'll be firing four kinds
of ammunition

30:16.867 --> 30:18.332
out of these three weapons.

30:18.333 --> 30:22.366
We've got a .308 round,
a .45-caliber pistol round,

30:22.367 --> 30:24.800
and a 12-Gauge double-aught
buck round.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.232
That looks pretty dead on.

30:29.233 --> 30:31.333
I'll leave the rest
to the bomb squad.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.699
Now, here's where things
get interesting.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.032
I think the .308 round
is going to be by far

30:37.033 --> 30:40.466
the most effective round
against the grenade,

30:40.467 --> 30:43.666
but its rifle is by far
the most difficult one

30:43.667 --> 30:44.899
to hit a grenade in midair with,

30:44.900 --> 30:46.399
while at the other end
of the spectrum,

30:46.400 --> 30:48.899
we've got the shotgun,
used for trap shooting,

30:48.900 --> 30:51.766
the easiest weapon to use
to hit a grenade in midair.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.532
But i think this,
the double-aught buck round,

30:53.533 --> 30:55.932
will be the least effective
against the grenade.

30:55.933 --> 31:00.566

and the lightweight buckshot.

was remotely triggered,

31:39.333 --> 31:41.832
and the grenade
was knocked off the stand.

survived that blast.

where we ramp it up and see

if we can make that

34:43.233 --> 34:44.966
which,
once the spoon is released,

34:44.967 --> 34:46.532
the striker is also released,

34:46.533 --> 34:51.166
and it flips over
and creates a spark, like so.

34:51.167 --> 34:53.066
Underneath that spark is a fuse.

34:53.067 --> 34:54.566
It's called the delay fuse,

34:54.567 --> 34:59.232
which is engineered to burn
for a specific period of time.

34:59.233 --> 35:00.899
Once it burns to its end,

35:00.900 --> 35:03.966
which is down somewhere
in the middle of the grenade,

35:03.967 --> 35:06.799
it ignites a small amount
of high explosive

35:06.800 --> 35:08.966
that's relatively unstable.

35:08.967 --> 35:10.466
That creates a small blast,

35:10.467 --> 35:12.866
which ignites the rest
of the high explosive

35:12.867 --> 35:14.732
that fills the grenade.

35:14.733 --> 35:17.632
At this point, you've basically
got a small pipe bomb

35:17.633 --> 35:20.700
which has a kill zone
of about 45 feet.

35:25.067 --> 35:26.167
Fire.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.532
Where'd it go?

35:30.533 --> 35:32.132
Adam:
It didn't go off.

35:32.133 --> 35:33.432
Narrator: But why?

35:33.433 --> 35:36.066
Before they fire up
the bomb baby,

35:36.067 --> 35:38.299
Adam fires up
the high-speed camera.

35:38.300 --> 35:41.499
Oh, criminy.
Jamie, come here.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.966
Dude...
Watch this.

35:44.967 --> 35:47.732
[ Laughs ]

35:47.733 --> 35:49.299
No...
No more grenade.

35:49.300 --> 35:52.532
Well, we don't have
a live grenade out there.

35:52.533 --> 35:54.432
We've got a bunch of dust.

35:54.433 --> 35:55.466
Wow.

35:55.467 --> 35:59.066
I totally did not see
that coming.

35:59.067 --> 36:01.066
Darn.
I wanted to wake the baby up.

36:01.067 --> 36:03.966
[ Laughs ]

36:03.967 --> 36:06.166
That's a result.

36:06.167 --> 36:11.599
Unbelievably, it seems that you
can indeed shoot a live grenade

36:11.600 --> 36:13.632
and render it inert.

36:13.633 --> 36:14.866
It's amazing.

36:14.867 --> 36:17.132
It disintegrated
the outer casing and then,

36:17.133 --> 36:19.532
even though this was
within its five-second range,

36:19.533 --> 36:22.066
did not let it explode the cap,

36:22.067 --> 36:24.066
so the tnt didn't blow up.

36:24.067 --> 36:25.067
Wow.

36:25.068 --> 36:26.899
I would not have called that.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.233
That is amazing.

36:30.267 --> 36:31.599
Jamie:
The double-aught buck

36:31.600 --> 36:33.232
completely disintegrated
the grenade,

36:33.233 --> 36:35.266
and that, frankly,
surprised us all

36:35.267 --> 36:37.666
because double-aught buck is...

36:37.667 --> 36:40.099
They're little
.38-caliber lead balls,

36:40.100 --> 36:42.266
and you wouldn't think it
would be able to do a whole lot

36:42.267 --> 36:44.466
to a steel grenade, but it did.

36:44.467 --> 36:47.799
It took it completely apart,
and it even took apart

36:47.800 --> 36:50.499
the blasting cap
before it could go off.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.066
Narrator:
An astonishing result.

36:52.067 --> 36:55.832
The fuse was lit electronically,
but before it could detonate,

36:55.833 --> 36:58.933
the buckshot
broke up the tnt party.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.899
Next up is a .45-caliber round
pointed at the grenade.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.132
If you remember,
only very recently

37:09.133 --> 37:11.766
we discovered it's a lot harder
to hit a midair grenade

37:11.767 --> 37:13.132
with one of these

37:13.133 --> 37:16.566
than it is with one
of those easy shotgun rounds.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.166
As to what it's going to do
to the grenade...

37:18.167 --> 37:19.499
You ready?

37:19.500 --> 37:24.632
Okay,
.45 acp, three...

37:24.633 --> 37:26.766
i expect it to have
a very similar effect

37:26.767 --> 37:28.732
as the double-aught buck.
Two...

37:28.733 --> 37:30.366
I think that the .45-Cal round

37:30.367 --> 37:32.832
is going to turn that thing
right into dust.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.833
One, fire.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.666
Hey.

37:37.667 --> 37:40.599
It shot it right off the thing.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.232
The cap went off,
but the grenade didn't.

37:43.233 --> 37:44.932
We knocked the grenade
off the stand.

37:44.933 --> 37:46.532
It looks like
we split it in half.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.099
So, we didn't stop the cap
from going off,

37:48.100 --> 37:50.432
but we did stop the grenade
from blowing up.

37:50.433 --> 37:52.300
That's cool.
That is very cool.

38:00.867 --> 38:03.166
Narrator:
Compared to the buckshot,

38:03.167 --> 38:04.699
the .45-millimeter round

38:04.700 --> 38:07.233
removed the blasting cap
with surgical precision.

38:08.300 --> 38:12.199
Either way, it's another
myth-confirming result.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.400
What's next?

38:20.733 --> 38:23.566
Adam: Now we're going to bring
some real energy to the equation

38:23.567 --> 38:27.166
by using a .308 sniper round,
full metal jacket.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.199
There we go.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.366
Adam: As to what this
is going to do to the grenade,

38:31.367 --> 38:34.066
I've been wrong
for everything so far,

38:34.067 --> 38:36.833
so I'm going to say
i have no freakin' idea.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.733
Three, two, one, fire.

38:44.100 --> 38:45.432
Adam:
The grenade went boom.

38:45.433 --> 38:48.500
We didn't disintegrate it.
It blew up.

38:50.133 --> 38:51.400
I think so.

38:53.433 --> 38:54.433
Let's look
at the high-speed.

38:54.434 --> 38:55.500
Okay.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.766
Narrator: The high-speed camera,
the scalpel, the microscope,

39:01.767 --> 39:05.266
the light, the multi-tool
for tackling time.

39:05.267 --> 39:06.267
There it is.

39:06.268 --> 39:07.932
And what it shows is...

39:07.933 --> 39:11.067
The grenade ignited the second
that it penetrated.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.067
That is a thing.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.466
The blasting cap
inside a grenade

39:18.467 --> 39:20.732
is actually
somewhat shock-sensitive,

39:20.733 --> 39:23.766
and the .308 round is a very,
very high-speed round.

39:23.767 --> 39:27.232
And that speed translates
directly to a certain amount

39:27.233 --> 39:29.066
of energy being brought
to the equation.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.232
And in our case, the .308 round,

39:31.233 --> 39:35.066
the very instant it touched
the exterior of our grenade,

39:35.067 --> 39:38.732
that shock caused the entire
thing to detonate early.

39:38.733 --> 39:41.832
It was a very,
very powerful reaction

39:41.833 --> 39:43.866
and an instant one.

39:43.867 --> 39:45.099
Narrator: Yep.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.099
It's the second
of three potential results

39:47.100 --> 39:49.166
and the most common
of the cinematic techniques,

39:49.167 --> 39:52.499
the midair explosion.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.299
But let's think about that
for a second,

39:54.300 --> 39:57.299
because if that ignited
the grenade

39:57.300 --> 39:59.432
at any closer than 45 feet,

39:59.433 --> 40:03.432
which is the kill zone
for a grenade, you're dead.

40:03.433 --> 40:09.366
Further than 45 feet, it starts
to become almost impossible

40:09.367 --> 40:10.432
to make a shot like that.

40:10.433 --> 40:14.299
Yes, in theory, it's possible,
but...

40:14.300 --> 40:17.700
I would duck.
Personally, i would just duck.

40:20.767 --> 40:23.232
[ Laughs ]
That worked!

40:23.233 --> 40:25.799
Adam:
So, to recap our final results,

40:25.800 --> 40:28.166
the high-powered rounds,
the .308,

40:28.167 --> 40:30.166
actually detonated the grenade,

40:30.167 --> 40:32.399
which means that if it's
within 50 feet of you,

40:32.400 --> 40:33.932
you're dead, sucker.

40:33.933 --> 40:35.732
But the low-powered rounds,

40:35.733 --> 40:38.199
the .45
and especially the shotgun,

40:38.200 --> 40:40.199
both rendered
the grenades inert.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.866
The shotgun's even
kept the blasting cap

40:42.867 --> 40:47.032
from going off, pretty much
the exact polar opposite

40:47.033 --> 40:48.466
of what we thought
was going to happen.

40:48.467 --> 40:49.767
Isn't that cool?

40:54.533 --> 40:56.632
So, where did we stand
with the original question

40:56.633 --> 40:59.366
of whether you can protect
yourself from a grenade

40:59.367 --> 41:00.799
using a gun?

41:00.800 --> 41:03.232
I think we found handily that
that is totally the case.

41:03.233 --> 41:05.632
Moreover, the weapon
that rendered the grenade

41:05.633 --> 41:07.066
the most inert

41:07.067 --> 41:08.732
was the one that was easiest
to shoot it out of the air with,

41:08.733 --> 41:09.733
the shotgun.

41:09.734 --> 41:10.932
Yep.
So, it's plausible.

41:10.933 --> 41:12.732
Totally plausible.
