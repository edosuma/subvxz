Previously  on "brothers & sisters"...

00:02.640 --> 00:04.340
is he really not taking any medition?

00:04.460 --> 00:08.160
The doctors told him by notaking the
painkillers,he's interfering with his own recovery.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.910
You're seeing your ex-wife?

00:10.030 --> 00:11.740
This,it's over.

00:11.860 --> 00:14.270
Your dad wants to take
you and elizabeth home,

00:14.280 --> 00:15.610
and not just for the weekend.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.570
William's death... I blame you,tommy.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.570
I'm not pretending anymore.I'm gay.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.110
That's wonderful for you.

00:22.180 --> 00:24.630
We just went straight to
being lovers,then fighters.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.010
We were never friends.Maybe
we could try that.

00:27.110 --> 00:30.370
I am sorry that you think
that.I still love you.

00:30.470 --> 00:32.750
I got mother of the year all sewn up.

00:32.870 --> 00:35.140
Saul,this is lena,uh,the
new office manager.

00:35.260 --> 00:38.060
I trust you,and you
better win this election.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.860
That is the plan,miss walker.

00:42.770 --> 00:45.740
okay,okay,so those two are best friends,

00:45.880 --> 00:47.880
and he's her boyfriend.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.970
- Wait,the one who made her get the boobs?
- No,he didn't make her get the boobs.

00:50.980 --> 00:53.600
It was...he supported
her in her decision.

00:54.790 --> 00:57.380
I can't...I can't believe
you watch this crap.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.140
I mean,is this what you were
doing when I was in iraq?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.050
sweetie,I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

01:01.150 --> 01:04.450
I just happened to be in the
kitchen,so I made you guys some lunch.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.090
- Wow,mom.
- Well,it's no big deal.

01:07.220 --> 01:11.630
It's,uh,swiss and avocado
and nitrate-free turkey bacon.

01:11.740 --> 01:14.030
You won't miss the nitrates.The
pork maybe,not the...

01:14.160 --> 01:17.200
ma,uh,re-rebecca just got
double-doubles,so we just ate.

01:17.530 --> 01:20.680
Oh.Gosh,I guess I-I should've asked.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.600
I...I'll just...I'll put
it in the fridge.Sure.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.510
Oh.that's the problem.

01:26.130 --> 01:27.100
oh,excuse me.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.630
uh,what time do you wanna leave
for the physical therapist?

01:29.740 --> 01:30.650
Um...

01:30.670 --> 01:31.580
oh,I thought I was taking him.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.600
Oh,no,no,no,rebecca.You've done
so much already.It's no problem.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.440
Nora,you're letting me live
here.It's the least I can do.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.760
Okay.Thanks.

01:47.780 --> 01:49.010
- one more thing.
- Yeah.

01:49.140 --> 01:51.960
- Um,did you take your pill?
- Trying to watch a show here,mom.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.150
I know.It's...four hours are up.

01:54.270 --> 01:56.450
- Yes,mom,I took my pill.
- Good.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.920
Mom,don't you have,like,four
other kids to worry about?

02:00.030 --> 02:02.580
Seriously,I mean,ma,sarah's
going through a divorce,and...

02:02.680 --> 02:04.490
and kitty's planning a
wedding,tommy's got a newborn,

02:04.590 --> 02:07.290
and kevin's in,like,a long-distance
relationship with a minister,

02:07.380 --> 02:09.120
which is possibly the
scariest thing I've heard.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.300
Like,do you feel like
spreading it out at all?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.050
- Yes.
- Okay.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.880
- Spreading.
- Spreading.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.200
- Spreading.
- Spreading.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.210
I am so pathetic.

02:19.310 --> 02:23.700
All I am missing is a lionel
richie song and a pint of ice cream.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.010
- Kitty,any luck?
- Uh,um...

02:26.130 --> 02:27.790
sa-sarah,just...just
hold on one second.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.120
No.I don't know.I-I know
I put it on your desk.

02:30.260 --> 02:32.320
look,I'm not trying to place
blame.I just gotta have the report.

02:32.430 --> 02:34.690
It's confidential,I have the
texas board of ed tomorrow,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.860
and,of course,our consultant
on this is in hawaii.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.320
Oh,god.I wish I was in hawaii.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.550
Did you get walter to check the car?

02:39.670 --> 02:40.770
Yes,all six of them.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.420
- I'm with travis.
- I'll keep looking.

02:42.550 --> 02:46.030
- kitty!
- God,who sends anything by snail mail nowadays?

02:46.140 --> 02:47.470
It's just...I don'T...

02:47.580 --> 02:49.600
okay,sarah,where,um,where were we?

02:49.710 --> 02:51.950
- Um...
- you know what you get for ten years of marriage?

02:52.320 --> 02:55.580
daffodils,diamonds or...

02:56.260 --> 02:59.100
an aluminum paperweight.That's
correct,ladies and gentlemen.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.550
Ten years,and all you get
is a stupid paperweight.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.340
And you know the tragic thing
is,I didn't even get that.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.380
Have you been day drinking?

03:06.480 --> 03:08.860
So what if I'm supposed
to hire a divorce attorney?

03:08.990 --> 03:11.210
So what if he's got the
kids for the next two days?

03:11.320 --> 03:13.980
So what if it was our wedding
anniversary tomorrow night?

03:14.090 --> 03:16.150
Oh,god!Sarah!

03:16.420 --> 03:19.410
Sarah,tomo...oh,your...it's
your anniversary.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.710
oh,god,it's mom.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.420
She's gonna be so sympathetic.

03:22.530 --> 03:24.310
I'm gonna end up having to comfort her.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.330
Well,just leter sympathize
th your voice mail.

03:26.470 --> 03:29.070
- Oh,sarah,are...are you okay?
- Sure.

03:29.170 --> 03:32.200
I'm just gonna spend the evening
watching my wedding video and howling.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.650
don't tell me.We should never
have set up her speed dial.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.440
Hold on.I'll get rid of her.

03:36.660 --> 03:39.270
hello,mom.Hi.How are you?I
can't talk right now.Bye.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.260
Wait,wait!Oh.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.430
All right.Fine.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.740
- Hey,are you there? -
Mm-hmm.Did you get rid of her?

03:45.790 --> 03:48.860
- Define "rid."
- oh,god,now she's calling me again!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.320
What does she want?

03:51.270 --> 03:54.120
Uh,you know,I don't know.she's just mom.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.810
She does this stuff.You know,I don't...

03:55.930 --> 03:58.420
she gets on a mission and then she...

03:59.400 --> 04:00.670
kitty?

04:01.210 --> 04:03.290
Feinberg Swope Prenuptial Agreement

04:03.830 --> 04:06.590
- Kitty! - Sa-sarah,I'm
gonna call you back.

04:06.690 --> 04:08.400
Okay.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.620
A paperweight.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.000
- Did you find it?
- What?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.760
The report.

04:15.060 --> 04:17.380
Oh,yeah.Um,I did.Here.

04:18.010 --> 04:19.269
Yeah.

04:21.730 --> 04:26.980
Wow,um,you know,I really don't like
going through your personal things.

04:27.110 --> 04:29.350
Come on,honey.We're getting
married and we work together.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.670
It's hardly like there's a line between
our professional and our private lives.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.630
Wow,you really are a good
politician,aren't you?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.930
I just wanna talk to my wife.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.920
Oh,it's funny how every
time I call,she's out.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.770
Your mom's on line one.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.460
"space"?Look,she's in another state.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.970
How much more space does she need?

04:51.430 --> 04:53.320
Fine.Great.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.360
Let hernow.Bye.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.680
Hey,tommy,we have a problem.

04:55.780 --> 04:58.110
The head distributor from
primary foods just called,

04:58.230 --> 05:03.400
and they wanna slash the supermarket
prices from $29 to $15 a bottle.

05:03.510 --> 05:04.730
No way.That's a joke.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.560
We'd be selling the wine for
less than the it costs to make it.

05:07.690 --> 05:08.710
No.We have a deal.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.520
Which is why I put a meeting
on the books for tomorrow.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.090
Tommy,we need this
account.Prepare to fight.

05:23.230 --> 05:24.880
Whoa,wow.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.270
You said a few people...

05:26.380 --> 05:28.420
well,you know what they
say,30's the new few.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.410
Yeah,I just...

05:30.520 --> 05:32.360
I don't know,I wasn't expecting...

05:33.270 --> 05:35.680
- all men?
- Yeah.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.800
Well,I guess I should've warned you,but then
you would've found an excuse not to come.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.860
Oh,come on,milo.I may be a lot of
things,but I'm certainly not that.

05:43.190 --> 05:44.730
Come on.We can catch up.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.210
Good,'cause I don't know anybody here.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.230
What'll you have?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.570
Uh,I'll have a gin
martini,straight up,very cold.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.160
Olives,please.

05:51.270 --> 05:53.290
duck rellenos with jalapeÑo relish?

05:53.420 --> 05:54.560
Uh,I'll be right back.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.110
- Try these.They're great.
- Okay.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.000
saul.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.700
Uh,scotty.Um,kevin's ex.

06:00.950 --> 06:03.800
We met last year at nora's,at the
most awkward dinner party ever.

06:03.910 --> 06:06.420
The one with the fantastic
mango peach salsa.

06:06.530 --> 06:07.570
Oh,yeah.

06:07.670 --> 06:08.850
Yeah,yeah,I remember.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.440
- Dinner parties.
- uh,yeah.

06:11.570 --> 06:12.890
Uh,no.Thank you.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.480
Nice to see you,scotty.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.460
- hi.
- Hi.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.100
- We're going away.
- We are?

06:24.230 --> 06:25.570
Yes.We're avoiding.

06:25.670 --> 06:26.700
What are we avoiding?

06:26.820 --> 06:31.070
Oh,well,you know,things like life
and work and ex-husbands,fiances.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.160
I booked us really good
package deal at ojai springs...

06:34.290 --> 06:36.290
- for tomorrow night.
- Wait.What,tomorrow?

06:37.060 --> 06:38.830
- I can'T.
- Oh,sarah.

06:39.300 --> 06:43.200
Come on,it's been way too long
since we've done anything,just us.

06:43.310 --> 06:44.770
No,we're...we're gonna
go.It's gonna be great.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.520
We're gonna get rubbed.We're gonna
get scrubbed.we're gonna get wrapped.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.720
No divorce talk,no
wedding talk,no stress.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.110
No stress?Who's not stressed?

06:53.310 --> 06:54.410
- hi,mom.
- Hi.

06:55.130 --> 06:58.240
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah.Mom came to cheer me up.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.940
I'm helping sarah go through
all the kids' old clothes.

07:01.060 --> 07:04.130
Yeah,and she's taking me
to the movies tomoow night.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.590
It's the ingmar bergman
retrospective at the egyptian.

07:07.990 --> 07:11.030
oh,mom.But don't you think that's
just a little bit of a downer?

07:11.150 --> 07:13.090
- I mean...
- no.Oh,no.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.690
It's "fanny and alexander."

07:14.790 --> 07:16.890
Oh,kitty,you should come.

07:17.320 --> 07:23.360
Wh...you know,mom,actually,I-I have
booked a spa for sarah in...in ojai.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.950
- Yeah,ojai springs spa.
- Oh.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.340
But you know what?You...you
guys have plans.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.850
- We'll...we'll...
- we'll do it another time.

07:29.890 --> 07:30.860
- Don't...
- I'm sorry.

07:30.870 --> 07:33.440
Oh,no.Sarah,you should go with kitty.

07:33.570 --> 07:36.060
I just wanted to make sure
you were busy tomorrow night.

07:37.210 --> 07:38.810
- Really?
- Absolutely.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.960
- You know,good for you?
- Yeah.

07:40.550 --> 07:42.000
- Yes,yes.
- Ingmar can wait.

07:42.110 --> 07:44.270
- Yeah,that's true.
- Really,you'll have so much fun.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.830
- This is a fabulous place.
- It is

07:45.950 --> 07:48.420
Your father and I used
to go there all the time.

07:48.540 --> 07:53.790
There's hiking and horseback riding
and this beautiful view of the valley,

07:53.930 --> 07:55.310
and you can sit there
and have dinner and...

07:55.440 --> 07:57.000
I haven't been there in so long.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.460
It was beautiful,and it
could be very,very green.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.710
- All right.Mom?
- Yeah?

08:00.730 --> 08:01.870
Why don't you come with us?

08:01.980 --> 08:03.150
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.160
Oh,no.You two need some sister time.

08:06.270 --> 08:08.550
I-I would just be tagging
along.Look,I'm sorry.

08:08.650 --> 08:11.460
I-I can'T.I just have
things,uh,justin...

08:11.470 --> 08:12.180
oh!

08:12.180 --> 08:13.260
- Good point.
- Oh,that's true.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.590
Of course,he survived iraq.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.590
You would think he could survive one
night in pasadena without his mother.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.550
yeah,but you...you know,it's...it's...

08:19.680 --> 08:21.270
- it's all the medications.
- The medication.

08:21.370 --> 08:25.070
You have him on such a very
strict dosage,um,schedule.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.310
- It'll mess it up.
- No.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.910
But rebecca is there,

08:29.020 --> 08:33.110
and she's perfectly capable of understanding
what "every four to six hours" means.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.470
It would be so great.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.860
We could stay up late,kitty,and
plan your wedding.

08:37.990 --> 08:42.789
Sarah,we need to get some serious talking
in about you and your joe situation.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.130
We could regroup and get perspective.

08:45.140 --> 08:48.110
It would be so great...
a real girls' getaway.

08:48.190 --> 08:49.130
Yeah!

08:49.500 --> 08:50.800
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

09:00.700 --> 09:02.620
You're not honestly
insinuating saul was there.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.370
No,I'm not insinuating.He was.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.670
Okay,so it was all
gay men and uncle saul.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.840
Why do I feel like I'm
being cross-examined?

09:08.950 --> 09:11.600
All I said was,"you never
told me your uncle's gay."

09:12.000 --> 09:14.170
I was making small talk.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.690
S-small talk?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.260
This is small talk..."nice
weather we're having."

09:17.370 --> 09:18.990
This is my uncle saul
we're talking about.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.470
I think I would know if he were gay.

09:20.590 --> 09:23.240
You know what?A lot of straight
people go to gay parties.

09:23.370 --> 09:26.450
I'm just saying,if you'd seen the way he and
this milo guy were looking at each other...

09:26.570 --> 09:28.440
oh,wow,they looked at each
other.How incriminating.

09:28.550 --> 09:29.740
Why are you being so defensive?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.780
He's dated women.He even dated
my dad's mistress,for god sake.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.380
You said that relationship
was doomed from the start.

09:34.510 --> 09:36.090
And how many 60-year-old
men do you know

09:36.220 --> 09:38.500
who have never had a serious
relationship with a woman?

09:39.190 --> 09:43.700
Kevin,it's time for you to take off
your prada shades and open your eyes.

09:46.430 --> 09:48.580
primary foods is just trying to compete.

09:48.690 --> 09:50.110
If our number doesn't cover your costs,

09:50.220 --> 09:53.500
maybe you should consider other
cost-efficient ways to produce.

09:53.980 --> 09:57.300
Mm,maybe we should
put our wine in boxes,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.420
save money on bottles?

09:59.880 --> 10:02.050
Hey.Sorry I'm late.

10:02.170 --> 10:04.300
- Neil
- Hey,sorry..

10:06.550 --> 10:09.330
Neil wants to box our wine.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.980
your partner has a very
funny sense of humor,tommy.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.190
But as I was about to explain,

10:14.310 --> 10:15.410
this is a corporate decision.

10:15.530 --> 10:19.800
You're trying to lowball us,take
advantage because we're a new company.

10:20.590 --> 10:24.140
a new company that's fighting
for shelf space against major brands.

10:24.270 --> 10:27.420
Look,we need to sell your wine at
a price where we can move units.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.800
tommy,do you have something
you want to add here?

10:31.100 --> 10:32.200
uh...

10:32.320 --> 10:34.230
yeah,look,at the end of the day,

10:34.340 --> 10:37.030
if we can't compete,we
don't belong in their stores.

10:37.150 --> 10:41.220
So what's the point in going
around in circles about it?

10:43.230 --> 10:44.520
Whoa.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.620
that was better than sex.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.470
Honey,I'm happy for you.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.500
- kiy,are you limping?
- I don't know.

10:52.620 --> 10:56.420
My guy was into some sort
of deep tissue elbow moves.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.760
Ow.How was urs?

10:58.890 --> 11:00.370
I gave away my appointment.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.610
You guys have to try the cucumber water.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.740
- You've just been sitting here all this time?
- I wanted to finish this.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.130
sarah,sarah,you have to look
at this.It's all about divorce.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.170
- Oh,great.
- So you're not gonna get a massage at all?

11:11.310 --> 11:14.030
I would just feel like I had to make
conversation.I've got so much to talk about.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.930
Mom,the point is you try 
not to talk.It's not therapy.

11:18.050 --> 11:21.660
Excuse me,ladies,I'm glad
you're enjoying our oasis.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.590
But would you mind just
keeping it down a bit...

11:23.700 --> 11:26.340
- in the quiet room?
- oh,sorry.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.690
- sarah...
- shh!

11:35.400 --> 11:38.120
- Sarah,this article is...
- mom,mom,mom,stop.Stop.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.340
- don't...don't ruin her buzz immediately.
- Yeah,you're killing my buzz,mom.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.890
this is so interesting.It's
really very uplifting.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.450
It says here that we're in the...

11:48.560 --> 11:50.690
the era of the "starter marriage"...

11:50.820 --> 11:55.080
whatever that means... and that there's just
tons of young divorcees like yourself out there.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.300
- Oh,goody,more competition.
- Oh.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.990
Oh,look,look.Divorce on
the rise.Okay,well...well,

12:00.110 --> 12:01.640
what's uplifting about that?

12:02.560 --> 12:08.660
"men admitted that sleeping with a divorcee
felt like sleeping with another man's wife."

12:09.190 --> 12:14.740
"which,according to bill from seattle,is
an incredible turn-on."You see?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.290
okay,well,bill...bill
needs to be incarcerated.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.080
No,bill from seattle needs
to give me his number.

12:20.690 --> 12:22.210
- listen,listen,listen.
- Shh.

12:22.330 --> 12:26.180
sorry.It says the 7-year itch
 now down to the 3-year itch.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.980
3?oh,come on,mom.That's ridiculous.

12:29.110 --> 12:31.750
- It's not the three years.Who writes this crap?
- Shh,quiet!

12:32.350 --> 12:35.490
- Kitty,you need a cold towel.
- You know what,mom?I don't want a cold towel.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.300
I ju...please,please,guys.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.880
Don't forget that I'm
getting married.Okay?

12:39.010 --> 12:40.790
Can we please stop
talking about the "d" word?

12:40.930 --> 12:42.940
Oh,please.The "d" word?

12:43.060 --> 12:45.720
It's divorce,not cancer.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.500
I'm gonna go take a steam.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.270
- sarah.
- Don't speaK.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.630
so I just wanted to make sure that
you got the notes on the speech.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.830
yeah,I have it right in front of me.

13:00.960 --> 13:01.970
Hey,let me ask you which is better...

13:02.080 --> 13:03.920
"english is a right all
students are entitled to,"

13:04.040 --> 13:06.750
or "english is something all
students should aspire to"?

13:07.240 --> 13:10.950
To which all students should
aspire.Do you ever get itchy?

13:11.210 --> 13:12.830
- I'm sorry?
- Itchy.

13:12.940 --> 13:15.490
Itchy,the itch.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.620
- Should I be concerned?
- No,I'm not talking about that.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.640
Is...is walter right there with you?

13:19.780 --> 13:21.460
Yes.Kitty,why are you whispering?

13:21.580 --> 13:24.090
Just want us to be able to communicate.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.950
I am your communications
director,for god sake.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.830
- Kitty,what are you talking about?
- I am talking about us.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.350
I mean,so if you have any doubts or...

13:34.920 --> 13:36.830
or reservations,I just..I...

13:37.230 --> 13:40.020
honey,I-I just want you
to be honest with me.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.780
Kitty,I have to give this english
immersion speech in seven minutes,

13:42.900 --> 13:45.190
and I'm still getting pounded
by the policy guys,okay?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.560
That's all you have to say to me?

13:46.680 --> 13:48.360
Well,that and I have to take a leak.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.230
- How's that for communication?
- Hi.

13:50.400 --> 13:55.050
sorry to interrupt.We don't
allow cell phones in the spa area.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.330
Make sure you include the
statistics on higher education.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.074

14:09.540 --> 14:11.670
Yeah,yeah.You know,you're
doing great,justin.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.580
- My knee is barely bending.
- No,no,no.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.930
A few degrees of motion is tremendous
progress in a short amount of time.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.600
don't be embarrassed.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.850
Your girlfriend will
like you either way.

14:28.380 --> 14:31.000
Oh,no,no,she's my sister.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.480
Oh,well,then she has to love you.Huh?

14:34.510 --> 14:36.460
- it's so depressing.
- women do it all the time,sweetie.

14:36.580 --> 14:37.470
God,thank god you're here.

14:37.490 --> 14:40.330
Mom's been trying to convince
me on the joys of single life.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.400
Well,I loved my single days,and
I'm missing them right now.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.380
You see?You see?

14:45.510 --> 14:46.850
Mom,it's completely different.

14:46.850 --> 14:49.500
Kitty was young and fabulous
and didn't have kids.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.780
- Oh,what are you saying?Look at you.
- You know,look at me.

14:51.900 --> 14:52.820
- Yeah,exactly.
- Yeah.You...

14:52.950 --> 14:55.260
- you're more fabulous now than ever.
- Absolutely.

14:55.390 --> 14:56.850
- I could ow you a picture from three years ago.
- Thank you,thank you.

14:56.990 --> 14:57.820
- You'd kill yourself.
- Thank you,thank you.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.300
- I'm telling you.
- Look,I know,things could be worse.I could be tommy.

15:00.820 --> 15:02.090
What?What's wrong with tommy?

15:02.220 --> 15:04.250
- I'm gonna try that cucumber water.
- Sarah.

15:04.690 --> 15:06.420
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

15:06.550 --> 15:10.010
Oh,just that,you know,at
least I don't have an infant.

15:10.130 --> 15:13.540
Can you imagine dating
and breast-feeding?

15:13.670 --> 15:14.790
Ugh.Ugh.

15:14.910 --> 15:18.010
- Well,tommy's not breast-feeding.
- What are you hiding?

15:20.570 --> 15:21.750
Okay.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.700
Okay,I went over to
tommy's the other night.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.730
He swore me to secrecy,so
neitherf you can say anything.Mom.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.610
- I won't say anything,ever.
- Okay.

15:32.510 --> 15:36.220
Julia isn't visiting her parents.

15:36.550 --> 15:39.480
- No?
- No.She's staying there,indefinitely.

15:39.610 --> 15:41.360
- What?
- She left elizabeth?

15:41.470 --> 15:43.380
No,mom,she took elizabeth with her.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.150
- oh,my god!Now if tommy finds out I told...
- What?She took elizabeth?

15:46.160 --> 15:47.810
ladies.

15:47.940 --> 15:51.320
I'm sorry,but you're gonna
have to leave the quiet room.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.430
- What?
- Wh-what?

15:52.530 --> 15:54.660
- You're throwing us out? - Do
I have to call security mnh-mnh.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.640
- Namaste.
- Oh,namaste,my ass.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.710
- Oh,I can't believe...
- I'm so sorry.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.450
mother.Mother,no.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.430
You are not gonna go to
the vineyard to see tommy.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.000
- NO,no,no.
- No,no,I'm not.

16:06.010 --> 16:08.510
- grab her purse.
- Don't...give me my purse.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.840
You promised.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.020
You promised you wouldn't say anything.

16:11.130 --> 16:12.870
I won'T.I won't say anything.

16:12.990 --> 16:15.520
We're in ojai.He's
just ten minutes away.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.710
I just thought I'd check
in,see if he's okay.

16:17.830 --> 16:19.680
Mom,he doesn't want us to know.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.870
Now stop it.You can't fix everything.

16:21.990 --> 16:25.310
First,it's project wedding,project
justin,project sarah.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.550
Now it...now it's
project tommy.Just stop.

16:27.670 --> 16:29.980
Yeah,can we get back to project me?

16:30.780 --> 16:32.830
Mom,I need you.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.370
It's why we're here.

16:35.490 --> 16:36.860
Oh,honey.Oh,I didn't mean...

16:37.000 --> 16:38.320
- every time,it's always...
- you know what?

16:38.440 --> 16:41.400
Let's all go have a drink
and we can talk,okay?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.440
Give me my purse back.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.420
All right.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.070
Bet you know how that works.

16:50.190 --> 16:51.150
Yo,yo,yo!

16:51.270 --> 16:52.910
- Hey,my man.
- Hey,what's up?

16:52.910 --> 16:54.180
- You two met yet?
- No.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.100
Justin walker,garrett fernandez.

16:56.220 --> 16:57.800
- What's up,man?
- Nice to meet you,bro.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.170
- Garrett,I'll be back in about two minutes.
- Yeah.

17:00.460 --> 17:02.260
No rush.I ain't going nowhere.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.109
- what's up,man?
- How you doing?

17:06.230 --> 17:08.380
Leg got shattered,crushed under
a humvee.It was good times.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.650
So are you in a lot of pain or...

17:11.700 --> 17:13.750
dude,I'm-a be honest with you.I'm
as high as a kite right now.

17:13.869 --> 17:15.750
I can't feel a thing.

17:19.589 --> 17:22.030
I'm sorry,ladies.It's a private event.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.349
And the maple grill is
still undergoing renovations.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.160
You could try in-room dining.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.730
will you excuse me?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.260
in-room dining.

17:29.370 --> 17:30.680
- That's so depressing.
- Our rooms are too small.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.570
I'm not doing that.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.750
Oh,oh,kitty!Kitty,kitty,kitty,it's
a wedding.

17:36.870 --> 17:39.100
Oh,wait a minute,wait a minute,you guys.

17:39.230 --> 17:42.190
- Lamb chops,12:00.
- Ohh,You wanna snag some?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.890
It's a big wedding.We'll blend in.

17:44.010 --> 17:45.400
- Mom!No!
- What

17:45.520 --> 17:47.740
Isn't it enough we just
got kicked out of the spa?

17:47.870 --> 17:49.350
Anyway,they're gonna recognize kittY.

17:49.470 --> 17:50.150
- Oh,no.No,they won'T.
- Oh,come on,sarah.

17:50.290 --> 17:51.610
- This is...
- this is ojai,for god sake.

17:51.710 --> 17:52.980
- Keep your head down.Keep your head down.
- I will,I will

17:53.420 --> 17:54.660
- We have no choice.
- Come on.

17:54.780 --> 17:55.920
No!No,no.

17:56.030 --> 17:59.720
Sarah,you of all people shouldn't be afraid
to go in there and grab a couple of lamb chops.

18:01.110 --> 18:04.800
What happened to the girl who used to
throw back bourbon and dance on the bars?

18:04.900 --> 18:07.010
- Yeah.
- Come on.Just be...

18:09.570 --> 18:11.840
apparently,she crashes weddings.

18:11.950 --> 18:14.290
So this morning was a bit of a disaster.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.090
Neil's an ass.

18:17.710 --> 18:20.360
I'm talking about you,tommy.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.630
You wandered in 20inutes late.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.190
You were completely distracted.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.400
- You left your cell phone on.
- It was an off day.

18:26.520 --> 18:30.000
You caved in the middle of
negotiations.You gave up.

18:30.060 --> 18:32.530
I mean,you...you left
me hanging in there.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.100
Your father never would've done that.

18:34.220 --> 18:37.250
Yeah,well,my father had a
wife who actually stuck around.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.570
What are you talking about?

18:40.210 --> 18:42.260
Julia took elizabeth and left,

18:42.410 --> 18:46.490
and I can't seem to get an answer
as to when or if she's coming back.

18:46.620 --> 18:47.540
Oh,tommy.I'm sorry.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.050
And,holly,in the future,don't ever
use my father like that with me again.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.200
mmm.He's cute.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.180
- oh,come on,kitty.
- He's 12!

18:58.540 --> 18:59.780
Mm.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.400
Oh,my!

19:01.520 --> 19:02.940
- Speaking of 12...
- no.

19:03.070 --> 19:05.910
I wonder what number wife
she is.Three,maybe four.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.080
Mm,hey.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.540
- What about him?
- Oh,kitty.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.740
You and I clearly have
very different taste in men.

19:11.870 --> 19:13.540
You know what,sarah?You're
way too picky.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.800
You've gotta shake off the joe.

19:16.150 --> 19:18.620
That's easy to say when
you're engaged,kitty.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.000
mm,don't tell me.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.970
It's your fiance.

19:23.090 --> 19:25.040
oh,thank god.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.560
- So?
- so I think "aspiring" went well.

19:27.580 --> 19:31.280
The board liked it,and,uh,when put that
way,the bilingual guys really couldn't argue.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.720
So what's your position on trophy wives?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.920
- Trophy what?
- Trophy wives.

19:35.930 --> 19:37.530
Yoknow,men with trophy wives.

19:37.650 --> 19:40.970
I'm just curious where
you stand on that issue.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.280
Kitty,what the hell is
happening at that spa?

19:43.410 --> 19:44.670
We can't have a serious conversation

19:44.770 --> 19:46.720
because you don't know
how to be open and honest.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.850
I will talk to you later.

19:52.660 --> 19:56.150
kitty,what do you think of
these little centerpieces?

19:56.280 --> 19:57.530
I hate them...

19:57.640 --> 19:59.240
and my fiance.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.240
- What?
- Who,robert?

20:00.250 --> 20:02.890
No,mother,my other fiance.

20:05.050 --> 20:08.630
robert drew up a prenup
without discussing it with me.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.280
Oh,honey.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.090
Lots of people have prenups today.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.680
It...it really makes a lot of sense.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.070
I mean,he's been
divorced,he has children.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.970
I honestly don't think it's any
reflection on how he feels about you.

20:19.000 --> 20:19.910
- No?
- Really.

20:19.930 --> 20:22.250
I mean,here I am,putting everything
I have into this relationship,

20:22.370 --> 20:22.930
and he's...

20:23.050 --> 20:26.550
he's planning an exit
strategy,planning for failure.

20:26.870 --> 20:28.460
I mean,and who can blame him?

20:28.580 --> 20:30.230
Everywhere you look,there's
another failed marriage.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.020
There's you and dad.There's you and joe.

20:32.150 --> 20:34.100
- There's tommy and julia now.
- Wait.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.760
Tommy's marriage isn't over.

20:35.870 --> 20:38.720
Yeah,and whoa,"failed"
is a very strong word.

20:39.360 --> 20:42.810
I had ten years with joe,

20:42.930 --> 20:44.580
- and ten good years.
- I'm sorry,sarah.

20:44.730 --> 20:46.670
- I didn't mean it that way.
- A toast...

20:47.120 --> 20:48.650
- oh.
- To ten good years.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.770
Right,ten good years.Come on.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.090
Ten good years.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.530
Thank you for bringing these,kevin.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.460
No problem.I was in the area anyway.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.080
I'm catching a 7:00 with
an old friend of mine.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.890
Scotty.You remember scotty.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.550
Oh,sure.I remember scotty.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.990
Actually,he said he saw
you the other night at,um...

21:05.110 --> 21:07.010
- milo peterman's house?
- Yeah,that's right.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.530
Milo was having some sort
of a housewarming thing.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.880
You...you know that he's
an old friend of mine,right?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.290
Recently divorced.

21:13.410 --> 21:15.180
Right,right,'cause he's gay.

21:16.370 --> 21:20.030
I didn't know that milo's sexual
orientation was any of our business,kevin.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.040
Right,because he's gay.

21:23.530 --> 21:24.620
Yeah.

21:25.020 --> 21:27.840
Hey,listen,I really appreciate
you bringing these documents.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.420
I will sign them,and
then we'll be through.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.870
Wait.Saul,what's going on?

21:33.380 --> 21:34.640
Nothing's going on,kevin.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.110
We're talking about a meaningless party.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.850
One that I probably wouldn't even have attended
if milo hadn't insisted that I be there.

21:39.970 --> 21:41.960
Look,you don't have to justify
being at a friend's house,

21:42.070 --> 21:44.130
but you're acting like
you have something to hide.

21:48.170 --> 21:49.920
Saul,are you gay?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.910
I-I just can't believe
that you're asking me this.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.730
Some cater waiter makes a
random accusation about me,

21:59.860 --> 22:03.100
- and you jump to the conclusion that...
- no,no,no one's accusing you of anything.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.120
But if it's not true,why
are you getting so defensive?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.330
Oh,please,kevin,stop being
such a lawyer with me.

22:07.470 --> 22:10.210
I am allowed to attend a party
without getting the third degree.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.890
Come on,saul,this is
me you're talking to.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.840
Listen,I have so much work to do,

22:16.980 --> 22:18.790
so why don't I just sign
this and then you can go?

22:18.910 --> 22:21.760
You know,when I came out,you
saw how dad treated me.

22:21.890 --> 22:23.400
He made me feel like he
was doing some huge favor,

22:23.540 --> 22:25.700
allowing me to remain
part of my own family.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.170
You could've stuck up for me.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.690
Well,I know that was a
hard time for you,kevin.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.680
Yes,it was,and it wasn't
made any easier by you.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.250
Kinda ironic given this
little turn of events.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.660
There you go.You're
doing what you always do,

22:39.790 --> 22:42.100
jumping to conclusions
that have no basis in fact.

22:42.240 --> 22:42.970
- Fact?Saul,you...
- so listen,

22:43.100 --> 22:45.210
when you are ready to
have an adult conversation,

22:45.330 --> 22:47.290
I would love to talk to you.

22:47.410 --> 22:50.260
But until then,we're done here.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.760
Fine.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.520
Maybe we should find out if
this chef is...is available,

23:04.630 --> 23:05.910
and if they do that kind of...

23:06.040 --> 23:08.040
excuse me,is this seat taken?

23:08.170 --> 23:09.660
- No.No.
- No.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.910
um...

23:13.960 --> 23:16.910
I suddenly remembered that I have
to make a very important phone call.

23:17.030 --> 23:18.840
- And...and...and,mother?
- What?

23:19.390 --> 23:21.850
Uh,you need to go to the bathroom.

23:21.970 --> 23:24.810
Yes.I do.I do.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.610
excuse me,I...

23:26.990 --> 23:28.530
need to use the restroom.

23:36.450 --> 23:38.910
Could you please get me my car?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.460
Could you please hurry? Come
on,there you go, there you go.

23:42.940 --> 23:44.760
So how do you know the ppy couple?

23:44.850 --> 23:46.440
Greg is my dad.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.590
Greg the groom greg?

23:49.710 --> 23:53.480
Oh, greg.Oh, greg. I-i... I love greg.

23:53.610 --> 23:55.040
Yeah, most women do.

23:56.220 --> 24:00.580
I'm trying not to get a complex.He's on
wife number three,and I'm still single.

24:01.790 --> 24:04.820
Well, if it'sany consolation, cliff,

24:05.410 --> 24:10.500
This would've been my 10-year weddi

24:10.800 --> 24:14.200
yep,I am about to be a divorcee,

24:14.340 --> 24:17.210
not that that should mean
anything,but feel free to flee.

24:19.100 --> 24:21.410
The most ofreedom  happy anniversary.

24:22.710 --> 24:24.580
Really.

24:27.430 --> 24:28.490
tommy.

24:28.610 --> 24:31.470
I don't mean to bother
you.It's almost 7:30.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.870
- Oh,sorry.
- Oh,no,no.It's okay.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.500
Hey,uh,lena?

24:37.750 --> 24:40.660
I know I haven't been the
easiest guy to work for lately,

24:40.800 --> 24:44.390
and I've just had a lot going on.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.700
And I wanted to tell you thank you and

24:46.940 --> 24:48.210
you've been doing a great job.

24:48.340 --> 24:52.500
So please go out and enjoy
your night,or what's left of it.

24:55.130 --> 24:59.560
Yeah.you know,um,traffic actually
is pretty awful at this hour,

24:59.680 --> 25:01.960
and I don't want to be presumptuous,but,

25:02.600 --> 25:04.580
I mean,we are at a winery.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.930
Think it'd be okay to open up a bottle?

25:07.330 --> 25:09.660
I like the way you think.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.690
yes.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.310
cheers.

25:28.430 --> 25:30.430
Cheers.

25:35.470 --> 25:36.690
- hi.
- Uh...

25:37.880 --> 25:39.060
- mom?
- Hi.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.850
Um,what are you doing here?

25:40.970 --> 25:43.050
I'm just over at ojai
springs with your sisters.

25:43.190 --> 25:45.320
I'm dying to see your offices.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.950
Sorry,I didn't realize you had company.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.370
Oh,this is our office manager lena.

25:50.520 --> 25:52.030
Lena,this is my mother.

25:52.140 --> 25:53.390
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:53.530 --> 25:56.050
- Very nice to meet you.
- You,too,mrs.

25:57.480 --> 26:01.180
I'll...I'll just...I'll be...over...

26:01.790 --> 26:04.530
oh,tommy,this is wonderful.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.060
Really,really wonderful.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.470
Uh-huh.Mom,save it.

26:09.590 --> 26:11.700
Sarah told you,didn't she?

26:12.050 --> 26:14.090
Oh,tommy,I'm so sorry.This
must be killing you.

26:14.230 --> 26:17.830
I don't understand.What was julia
thinking?Why would she do this?

26:17.950 --> 26:19.750
I don't know.She...

26:20.100 --> 26:22.570
said she needed space.She
needed her family.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.250
You're her family.Is she
saying she doesn't need you?

26:25.270 --> 26:27.050
She's not saying much at all.

26:27.070 --> 26:30.200
I mean,she won't return my calls.Her
parents are stonewalling me.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.790
Well,then you have to get in the car
right now and yohave to drive there.

26:32.920 --> 26:33.780
- To where?To
phoenix? - Mm-hmm.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.690
I know.That's what you'd do.You're here.

26:35.820 --> 26:38.450
Honestly,tommy,honestly,you
have to drive there.

26:38.580 --> 26:41.020
You have as much say in this
as anyone.She's your wife.

26:41.170 --> 26:42.930
You can't just sit around
and let this happen.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.510
Let it?I didn't just let it,mom.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.690
if there was something I could
do,don't you think I'd be doing it?

26:48.810 --> 26:50.620
Yes.

26:52.210 --> 26:55.510
Look,I appreciate your concern,I do.

26:55.610 --> 26:58.680
And if there was anything
you could do,believe me,

26:58.810 --> 27:00.520
I would tell you.

27:00.660 --> 27:04.370
But this is between
julia and me,all right?

27:04.500 --> 27:06.130
And we will figure it out.

27:06.270 --> 27:09.030
- Just don't worry.Please.
- Oh,how can I not worry?

27:09.160 --> 27:12.780
Just go back to the hotel with
kitty and sarah and have fun...

27:13.020 --> 27:15.290
try to relax.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.280
- Tell linda that I...
- lena.

27:17.390 --> 27:20.400
Lena that I said
good-bye,nice to meet her.

27:20.530 --> 27:23.310
And,tommy,if you talk to sarah or...

27:23.440 --> 27:25.850
or kitty,don't mention
I was here,all right?

27:27.500 --> 27:28.880
- Tommy...
- mom.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.280
- I'm going.
- Okay.

27:30.490 --> 27:32.290
Bye.

27:46.210 --> 27:48.450
- It's,um,it's this one here.
- aha.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.760
- Oh,good.
- Oh.

27:52.890 --> 27:54.680
Whoo!

27:58.070 --> 27:59.860
- just be really good,right?
- Yeah.

28:00.530 --> 28:02.700
damn these little plastic keys,you know?

28:02.810 --> 28:05.090
Why'd they got rid of those
nice,old-fashioned ones?

28:06.220 --> 28:08.130
- You wanna have a go?
- Sure.Yeah.Please.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.390
apparently,your lock hates me.

28:16.990 --> 28:19.860
Great,great,we're being lockblocked.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.460
- Oh,god.
- No,no,I'll figure this out.

28:21.580 --> 28:24.250
God,we should be able to do
this.I should be able to do this.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.650
We could just go down and
get one from the front desk.

28:25.780 --> 28:28.060
I mean,my husband's moved
on.He's back with his ex-wife...

28:28.180 --> 28:29.120
or his ex-ex wife,given
I'm his ex-wife...

28:29.250 --> 28:31.190
not that we're officially divorced,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.400
so I don't even kn what my
official title is,but I am single.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.150
And I'm off mommy duty.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.210
You know,no one's asking me to tuck
them in or read them a scratchy story.

28:39.330 --> 28:43.030
I'm at this gorgeous resort and
with this very nice guy,and...

28:45.170 --> 28:46.750
right.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.520
This isn't happening,is it?

28:52.170 --> 28:54.390
I'm so sorry.This is so embarrassing.

28:54.510 --> 28:57.360
All right,well,ahem,I
should probably get back...

28:57.670 --> 28:59.200
my dad.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.540
oh,god,you know,I'm sorry.

29:00.670 --> 29:03.570
I didn't mean to drag you away
from your father's wedding.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.280
- Are you just gonna hang here?
- Yeah.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.890
Yeah,until you leave.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.690
Then I'm gonna kick the door
down and raid the minibar.

29:12.790 --> 29:14.880
Okay,well,good lk with that.

29:20.650 --> 29:22.640
god.

29:31.810 --> 29:33.260
oh!

29:41.660 --> 29:43.190
Okay,do you want pizza or thai?

29:43.300 --> 29:46.690
And not a word to your mom
that I can barely boil water.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.820
Wow,that's almost 45 degrees in one day.

29:50.970 --> 29:51.790
Doesn't that hurt?

29:51.890 --> 29:53.760
No,it actually feels pretty good.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.900
- This is good news.
- Yeah,that's great.

29:59.760 --> 30:03.400
Um,okay,I hate to...
I hate to ask,but,uh...

30:04.290 --> 30:06.770
you know,this morning,you
were in so much pain and...

30:06.890 --> 30:09.260
and could barely move your leg,and...

30:09.660 --> 30:12.160
then after all the things
that garrett said,um...

30:12.270 --> 30:13.600
so?

30:14.530 --> 30:15.980
Well...

30:18.560 --> 30:21.680
did you up your pain medication,justin?

30:22.470 --> 30:25.160
I can't believe you'd ask me that.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.330
Uh,no.No,of course I didn'T.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.060
Wow,so,uh,so you don't believe me.

30:35.190 --> 30:36.750
So you think I'm an addict  and a liar?

30:36.870 --> 30:38.680
Justin,you were the one who said that you
were worried about taking the pills so...

30:38.800 --> 30:41.040
yeah,because I knew something
like this would happen!

30:41.180 --> 30:42.850
You know,people watching
me and accusing me.

30:42.980 --> 30:43.650
I'm just...I'm making sure that...

30:43.770 --> 30:45.550
so accusing me is gonna
make me feel better?

30:45.670 --> 30:46.600
No,rebecca.You know what?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.850
You of all people,after everything we've
been through,you think I'd lie to you?

30:49.980 --> 30:52.480
You know what?Count them.

30:52.620 --> 30:53.800
- Count them!
- Justin,no.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.630
Just count the pills!

31:05.440 --> 31:06.820
There's seven.They're...they're
all there.

31:06.950 --> 31:09.220
Yeah.You know what?Don't worry
about ordering me anything.

31:09.350 --> 31:11.850
I lost my appetite.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.370
- Justin,I was just...
- don'T.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.200
Yeah,I finished mine,too.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.680
Yeah,my mother's presence
has that effect on people.

31:21.810 --> 31:23.990
Everyone's mother does.

31:26.750 --> 31:28.520
Are you okay?

31:30.720 --> 31:32.820
You wouldn't know this,but,uh,

31:32.940 --> 31:35.830
elizabeth had a brother,a twin.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.150
We had to make a...

31:37.270 --> 31:39.830
a choice right when
they were born and,um...

31:41.440 --> 31:43.390
william died.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.460
Oh.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.430
I had no idea.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.080
God,I'm so sorry.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.690
And julia thinks it's my
fault.She thinks that I did it.

31:53.820 --> 31:55.000
Oh,that's ridiculous.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.990
I don't know,sometimes
I feel like she's right.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.750
You can't blame yourself.

32:01.860 --> 32:04.120
It's just that...

32:05.220 --> 32:08.880
we had to make this decision so quickly.

32:10.810 --> 32:14.640
I was so afraid of...of
losing them both,and...

32:16.700 --> 32:19.310
and they're all gone.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.900
Tommy...no.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.510
It's gonna be okay.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.610
It's just,you...

32:27.730 --> 32:31.770
you can't take it all on and
then worry about everyone else.

32:31.890 --> 32:35.310
Sometimes you need to
just think about yourself.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.960
I appreciate you coming here,kevin.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.090
I was out of line today.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.290
Me,too,saul.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.740
but I do know what you're going through.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.740
I-I know,I know.

32:50.860 --> 32:53.260
We're...we're from
different generations,

32:53.390 --> 32:58.050
and I'm sure you think I
had things a lot easier.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.470
And whatever it is you need from me,

33:00.590 --> 33:02.930
- I'm here for you.
- Okay.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.930
But...

33:07.980 --> 33:10.640
- you don't have to hide anything.
- Kevin...

33:13.020 --> 33:16.510
you have to understand,I'm
not hiding anything from you.

33:18.650 --> 33:21.060
I'm not gay.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.820
I...

33:25.740 --> 33:28.500
I'm not gay.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.390
hi.You girls are back already.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.180
- You are so busted,mom.
- You promised me,mother,

33:40.290 --> 33:42.330
and now you've just
totally been plotting.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.030
I wasn't plotting.You girls were busy.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.410
Oh,right,so you just...

33:45.540 --> 33:48.200
you just went and did something that
we specifically asked you not to do.

33:48.310 --> 33:49.770
And now tommy's furious with me.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.670
Sarah,tommy is only furious with me.

33:51.790 --> 33:52.540
Oh,mother,you know,you just...

33:52.650 --> 33:54.320
you just couldn't help
yourself,could you?

33:54.450 --> 33:57.320
I mean,you really,really
have to learn how to relax.

33:57.440 --> 34:00.640
Oh,would everyone please 
stop ordering me to relax?

34:00.740 --> 34:02.240
How can I possly relax?

34:02.370 --> 34:03.350
Mom,you just don't get it.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.490
The whole idea of this weekend
was for us to escape our problems.

34:07.740 --> 34:11.139
Instead,you've rubbed our faces in
them and then gone and created new ones.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.230
Fine,so shoot me.I'm concerned.

34:13.530 --> 34:15.949
And why wouldn't I be concerned?I
mean,look at all of you.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.630
You're consumed with
post-divorce despair.

34:18.739 --> 34:20.980
You're caught up in this
perpetual commitment phobia.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.630
Justin's in constant agony
and lucky to be alive.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.570
Julia has left tommy and
taken elizabeth with her.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.830
And kevin,kev... well,I
don't know about kevin.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.040
He won't return my phone calls.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.500
Okay,all right,mother,so it
hasn't been a banner month for us.

34:31.620 --> 34:32.530
But...but you know what?

34:32.650 --> 34:36.020
- For your own sanity and for ours,just loosen up on the reins a little bit.
- Right.

34:36.150 --> 34:39.030
I mean,stop focusing on us so much
and start focusing on yourself.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.480
I love you.You're my children.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.480
When you're in trouble,I'm
in trouble.I'm sorry.

34:42.590 --> 34:45.060
I don't know how to say,"oh,la-di-da,I
think I'll go play golf."

34:45.170 --> 34:47.370
you're everything I've
ever done with my life.

34:47.489 --> 34:49.040
Believe me,I lay awake at night,

34:49.170 --> 34:51.940
praying you guys will get your lives
together so I can get some sleep.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.290
- Oh,please.
- Oh,for god sake,mother,

34:53.440 --> 34:56.760
we're not responsible for your
sleep nor you for our happiness.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.640
Exactly.We're grown-ups.We're adults.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
- We're legal in 50 states.
- Legal?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.860
- We're practically seniors.
- I mean,come on,see?Grown-up.

35:01.980 --> 35:04.720
God,I hate this person,this
mother you see me as,

35:04.820 --> 35:08.230
whose daughters felt so obligated
to where they had to invite her along

35:08.340 --> 35:10.690
on their little spa weekend even
though they didn't want her there.

35:10.790 --> 35:13.370
Well,if you knew it was an
obligation,mom,why did you come?

35:13.480 --> 35:15.420
Yeah,mom,why didn't you just say no?

35:15.550 --> 35:19.490
Yes,I should've said no.I
should've said no,no,no!

35:19.600 --> 35:21.070
- I never should've come.
- Yeah.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.810
- No.
- Ever.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.010
well,that went well.

35:34.660 --> 35:35.840
- hey.
- Good morning.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.370
Good morning.

35:39.950 --> 35:42.890
Weren't you wearing that yesterday?

35:44.240 --> 35:46.730
- We worked late,uh,so...
- I,um,I crashed at a friend'S...

35:46.860 --> 35:47.810
I stayed the night.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.800
- It didn't make sense to drive home.
- In santa barbara.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.670
Tommy,a word?

36:04.100 --> 36:05.880
Do you think I'm stupid?

36:06.240 --> 36:08.190
- Sorry?
- Don't play dumb with me.

36:08.310 --> 36:10.580
I wrote the book on this,remember?

36:10.720 --> 36:14.620
I did it with your father for 20 years
with a hell of a lot more discretion.

36:14.730 --> 36:18.900
Now tell me what I think is
happening isn't actually happening.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.380
- Nothing is happening.
- Oh,really?

36:21.500 --> 36:26.690
Well,then why is it that it took me about
five seconds to pick up on this nothing?

36:26.790 --> 36:30.200
And how long before you think
everybody else starts figuring it out?

36:30.330 --> 36:32.860
Everything I own is
invested in this business.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.870
She is our employee!

36:40.370 --> 36:41.640
look,I...

36:41.760 --> 36:45.410
I know that you have a lot
going on at home with julia,

36:45.530 --> 36:47.760
and I am sorry for
that.Everybody makes mistakes.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.300
God knows I have.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.360
But that is it.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.700
It ends now.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.880
From now on,it is no longer a mistake.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.250
It is a choice.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.440
And I hope you make the right one.

37:05.030 --> 37:06.830
mom!

37:07.770 --> 37:10.300
- We've been looking everywhere for you.
- we've been looking all over for you.

37:10.430 --> 37:11.620
Shh!

37:14.310 --> 37:15.940
I'm just not gonna talk for a while,

37:16.070 --> 37:20.310
no matter how much I think you may need
to hear my fabulous words of wisdom.

37:20.430 --> 37:21.840
You know,I know.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.600
I know what I'm doing.

37:23.710 --> 37:28.960
I know I'm doing my commitment-phobic
thing again and that's why I'm still single.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.420
And I'm using the prenup as an excuse,and
it's probably not a big deal and...

37:36.910 --> 37:39.120
right?

37:40.180 --> 37:42.150
Wait a minute.Mom?

37:42.680 --> 37:44.430
Wait,no,no,no,please.Please
don't do this.

37:44.550 --> 37:47.130
I need you to tell me what
you're thinking.No,moM.

37:47.230 --> 37:49.900
Please.

37:50.620 --> 37:53.710
Well,all right,kitty,just
really quickly.

37:53.820 --> 37:56.930
Honey,maybe it does mean something.

37:57.070 --> 37:59.400
And what,worst case scenario...

37:59.520 --> 38:01.360
robert doesn't have enough
trust in you as a couple?

38:01.490 --> 38:04.380
Maybe he senses your doubts,or
for whatever the reason.

38:04.510 --> 38:07.950
Sometimes you have to have
enough trust for both of you.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.630
And it will shift.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.410
It always does.That's what marriage is.

38:12.530 --> 38:14.300
And if it doesn'T...

38:14.420 --> 38:16.850
never mind.

38:17.230 --> 38:20.270
Come on,mom.Come on.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.430
well,if it doesn't,then
you have to acknowledge it,

38:25.540 --> 38:29.740
have the courage to let go,hurt
like holy hell and move on.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.790
I...you know,I'm not
lecturing.I am not lecturing.

38:35.920 --> 38:39.950
You two are grown-ups and perfectly
capable of taking care of yourselves.

38:41.020 --> 38:43.410
- Miss walker?
- Yes?

38:44.980 --> 38:48.150
And I have an appointment.

38:57.670 --> 38:58.980
hey.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.880
Silent treatment.Very effective.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.810
look,I was wrong,okay?

39:13.950 --> 39:15.150
And if I could take it back,I would,

39:15.290 --> 39:17.880
but you have gotta stop being mad at
me because I can't...I can't take it.

39:17.990 --> 39:20.650
I mean,you're the one person in
my life who actually gets me,and...

39:27.450 --> 39:29.850
I should've known better.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.300
I should've trust you

39:33.200 --> 39:34.940
All right,look,don't
worry about it,okay?

39:35.050 --> 39:38.130
I probably overreacted a
little bit,and,you know,even...

39:38.250 --> 39:40.420
even the smallest dose of this stuff
can sort of amp things up a little.

39:40.530 --> 39:42.950
So in my book,it's squashed.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.560
All right,we're don besides,I've
been waiting for you to get up.

39:47.320 --> 39:51.390
I kinda wanna know if the girl with
the boobs forgave the initials girl.

39:51.730 --> 39:53.530
Did you already art watching?

39:53.660 --> 39:56.380
If I said yes,would
you think less of me?

40:00.270 --> 40:01.460
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:01.580 --> 40:03.850
- You're back.
- Yeah.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.070
oh,honey,I...

40:10.340 --> 40:11.820
I...

40:11.940 --> 40:15.770
accidentally found the prenup.

40:16.190 --> 40:17.110
Ay.

40:17.150 --> 40:20.090
- You didn't have to hide it from me.
- I wasn't hiding it from you.

40:20.230 --> 40:22.360
The lawyers drew it up.I was
gonna talk to you about it.

40:22.480 --> 40:25.990
I understand that you have a
valid reason for wanting a prenup.

40:26.100 --> 40:30.040
You know,you're divorced,you have
kids and you could be president and...

40:30.170 --> 40:32.090
well,that's why the guys drafted it.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.560
Yeah.

40:33.690 --> 40:37.330
And...and yes,you know,the
odds are against us.

40:37.470 --> 40:40.650
And maybe you don't entirely
believe that we're gonna make it,

40:40.790 --> 40:45.650
anthat's okay because I do,and
I'm sorry th i didn't before.

40:45.780 --> 40:49.080
Something just...just hit me last night.

40:49.300 --> 40:51.890
And I don't know,I just know now
that you and i are gonna be okay.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.400
So if you need me to
sign a piece of paper...

40:54.520 --> 40:55.660
kitty,listen to me.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.980
If I wanted you to sign a
prenup,believe me,I would've asked you.

40:59.680 --> 41:03.230
But I don'T.I have faith in us.

41:03.350 --> 41:05.540
Although you make quite
a case for a prenup.

41:05.670 --> 41:07.910
Hmm,well,we can still talk about it.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.810
'Cause I could very easily take
you for everything you're worth.

41:09.940 --> 41:11.300
- Quit talking.
- No,I could.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.440
It wouldn't be hard.
