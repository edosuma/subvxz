00:03.212 --> 00:04.327
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:04.505 --> 00:06.962
- How many are there?
- A pack of them, an Alpha pack.

00:07.383 --> 00:08.042
Cora?

00:08.217 --> 00:09.627
She's my sister, my younger sister.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.588
I couldn't let that be
the last memory that you had of her.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.423
You want
to take this downstairs?

00:14.724 --> 00:16.009
And you know what I want for my birthday?

00:16.184 --> 00:17.219
To not be a virgin.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.471
Emily, Heather,
the guy Lydia found at the pool,

00:19.687 --> 00:20.847
all three were virgins.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.554
Sacrifices. Human sacrifices.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.646
- It's not gonna hurt him, is it?
- Just a little.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.324
But I usually find that it's the owners

00:36.162 --> 00:38.153
Who feel the most pain.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.374
All right. Well, we'll just check
the stool sample for parasites,

00:43.586 --> 00:47.420
but my guess is that he probably just ate
something he shouldn't have.

00:47.632 --> 00:48.621
Got a cool name.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.131
He's got two brothers at home
named Beretta and Trigger.

00:51.302 --> 00:52.417
Military family.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.341
Looks like he knows who the Alpha is.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.845
Let's go, buddy.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.766
Okay, this usually happens
before we go to the vet.

01:10.655 --> 01:11.644
Hey!

01:17.787 --> 01:19.402
Found something.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.906
Rinse it off.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.462
What is it?

01:34.637 --> 01:38.471
Definitely poisonous for the dog.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.299
Actually, for you as well.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.055
Wolfsbane?

01:43.354 --> 01:44.935
Mistletoe.

01:47.525 --> 01:48.935
Bullet?

01:53.948 --> 01:55.108
Come here, Bullet.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.736
Come here, Bullet.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.457
There you are.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.379
Come on, Bullet.

02:30.443 --> 02:33.435
Son of a bitch! Did you just bite me?

02:45.666 --> 02:46.951
Closer.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.870
Come closer.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.082
Closer.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.443
What do you want?

04:47.663 --> 04:50.951
You gonna threaten me?
Tell me that no one's gonna believe me?

04:51.167 --> 04:52.782
Try to scare me?

04:54.295 --> 04:55.455
Kill me?

05:00.509 --> 05:02.966
I was gonna see if you were okay.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.004
Physically or emotionally?

05:07.224 --> 05:10.762
Although, I guess that presupposes
I was emotionally okay before any of this.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.641
And according to my therapist,
that's been debatable for a long time.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.981
I think you're gonna be okay.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.952
Obviously, you've never taught high school.

05:31.165 --> 05:36.159
In 20 minutes, I have to start
two dozen teenagers on "The Crucible,"

05:36.378 --> 05:39.040
and I honestly have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.874
Well, why don't you start by telling them
that it's an allegory for McCarthyism?

05:43.093 --> 05:46.335
Is that a subtle way of suggesting
that I shouldn't say anything?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.095
Because I won't.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.731
Who are you?

06:01.487 --> 06:03.273
I'm Derek.

06:03.489 --> 06:04.854
JennHeL

06:11.831 --> 06:13.162
I looked everywhere.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.990
It's like he just walked away.
Left his car, his dog.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.872
Okay. Was he, like...
Could he have been a virgin maybe?

06:19.088 --> 06:21.830
Did he look like a virgin?
Was he, you know, virginal?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.505
No, definitely not.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.799
Deaton makes me have sex
with all of his clients.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.126
It's a new policy.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.848
No, I don't know if he was a virgin.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.474
And why are you talking
like he's already dead?

06:38.649 --> 06:39.855
He's just missing.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.729
Missing and presumed dead
because he's probably a virgin, Scott.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.482
And you know who else is a virgin?
Me. I'm a virgin, okay?

06:45.698 --> 06:46.653
And you know what that means?

06:46.866 --> 06:49.448
It means my lack of sexual experience
is now literally a threat to my life.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.991
Okay, I need to have sex, like, right now.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.034
Someone needs to have sex
with me, like, today.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.737
Like, someone needs to sex me right now!

06:54.957 --> 06:56.037
All right, I'll do it.

06:57.835 --> 06:58.790
What?

06:59.003 --> 07:02.166
Come to my place at 9:00.
Plan to stay the night.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.416
I like to cuddle.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.129
Oh.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.212
That was so sweet. Are you kidding?

07:07.428 --> 07:09.840
Yes, I'm kidding.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.307
Okay, you know, you don't toy
with a guy's emotions like that, Danny.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.722
It's not attractive, all right?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.311
Mr. Lahey, happy to have you back.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.478
- Not happy that you're late.
- Sorry, Coach.

07:19.899 --> 07:20.854
I'II remind you all.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.149
Cross-country is not optional
for lacrosse players.

07:24.361 --> 07:29.572
I don't need you turning into a bunch
of fat-asses in the off-season.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.275
So work on that.

07:56.060 --> 07:57.721
Pace yourselves! Come on!

07:57.937 --> 08:00.019
- Isaac!
- It's them.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.055
Isaac, wait!

08:52.741 --> 08:57.531
Ethan, I always forget,
how many bones in the human body?

08:57.746 --> 09:00.658
I don't know. Let's count.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.324
That's one.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.098
It's him, isn't it?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.911
Hey, get out of the way. Get back.
Get this area cordoned off

09:41.123 --> 09:42.488
before they trample
every piece of evidence.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.248
- Back up! Everyone back!
- Get these kids out of here!

09:45.461 --> 09:48.294
Dad, just come here. Look, look. Look at it.
It's the same as the others, you see?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.494
Yeah, I see that.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.665
Do me a favor. Go back to school, yeah?

09:52.843 --> 09:54.879
Coach, can you give us a hand here?

09:55.095 --> 10:00.510
You heard the man. Nothing to see here.
Probably just some homeless kid.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.012
- Coach.
- Yeah?

10:03.228 --> 10:05.480
He was a senior.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.976
He wasn't on the team, was he?

10:08.192 --> 10:11.059
Kyle! Oh, God, Kyle!

10:11.278 --> 10:14.566
- Oh, God!
- Go on. Go. Go.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.155
You see the way the twins looked at him?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.278
Yeah, you mean like
they had no idea what happened?

10:19.495 --> 10:21.781
No, no, they knew.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.783
The kid was strangled
with a garrote, all right?

10:23.999 --> 10:27.241
Am I the only one recognizing the lack
of werewolfitude in these murders?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.294
You think it's a coincidence they turn up,
and then people start dying?

10:30.506 --> 10:33.293
Well, no, but I still don't think it's them.

10:33.509 --> 10:34.965
Scott?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.876
How about you?

10:38.097 --> 10:40.258
I don't know yet.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.465
You don't know yet?

10:42.684 --> 10:45.300
Well, he's got a point.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.183
Seriously, dude, human sacrifices?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.434
Scott, your eyes turn
into yellow glow sticks, okay?

10:50.651 --> 10:54.064
Hair literally grows from your cheeks,
and then will immediately disappear,

10:54.279 --> 10:56.270
and if I were to stab you right now,
it would just magically heal,

10:56.490 --> 11:00.233
but you're telling me you're having trouble
grasping human sacrifices?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.072
That's a good point, too.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.277
I don't care, all right?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.331
They killed that kid.
They killed the girl that saved me.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.458
And I'm gonna kill them, too.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.294
Stop. You're not done healing.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.552
- Yeah? Well, I'm done lying around.
- Then sit.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.383
Are you gonna help me go after them?

11:34.945 --> 11:37.311
Come on, fight back!

11:38.657 --> 11:40.568
I came back for this?

11:42.494 --> 11:46.157
I can't believe I got my ass
thrown in a vault for three months for you.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.705
All those rumors I heard.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.709
A powerful new Alpha,
one of the Hales, building a pack.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.291
Do you know how long I waited
to hear something like that?

11:54.506 --> 11:57.998
Do you have any idea how it felt
to find out you were alive?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.467
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.136
- What's that?
- Trouble.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.768
No, wait. Wait!

12:22.492 --> 12:23.823
Ready for a rematch?

13:14.503 --> 13:16.619
Everybody done?

13:17.589 --> 13:20.422
'Cause just listening to that
was exhausting.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.178
So...

13:29.434 --> 13:31.220
Let's chat.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.443
Mademoiselle?

13:43.282 --> 13:45.443
Mademoiselle Argent?

13:46.118 --> 13:47.107
Allison!

13:50.163 --> 13:51.448
Es-tu fatiguÃ©e?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.456
Sorry.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.920
You're starting to concern me, Allison.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.714
Maybe we should chat
in the guidance office sometime.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.674
Or maybe you should tell me

14:12.894 --> 14:14.600
what you were doing
at the bank the other night.

14:14.813 --> 14:18.055
Maybe you should tell me
what you were doing there.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.069
Looks like we have a situation here.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.526
Tell you what,

14:27.743 --> 14:30.951
give me the French word for it
that's the same in English,

14:31.121 --> 14:33.453
and you can avoid lunchtime detention.

14:34.833 --> 14:35.868
Um...

14:37.753 --> 14:39.368
Impasse.

14:46.053 --> 14:51.013
All right, since inertia is a subject
of which you all know plenty,

14:51.224 --> 14:54.011
why don't we start with momentum?

14:55.270 --> 14:56.931
They're here for a reason.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.596
Give me a chance to figure it out
before you do anything.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.766
Okay? Isaac.

15:04.488 --> 15:07.946
Danny, what do we know
about momentum?

15:08.116 --> 15:10.448
It's the product of mass and velocity.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.992
The more massive something is,
the faster it's going.

15:13.163 --> 15:16.030
Mr. Harris, can I use the bathroom, please?

15:17.959 --> 15:19.870
- I have to go to the bathroom, too.
- One at a time.

15:23.799 --> 15:27.963
But I really have to 90.
Like, medical emergency have to go.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.299
Mr. McCall, if your bladder
suddenly exploded,

15:31.515 --> 15:37.055
and urine began to pour from every orifice,
I would still respond, "One at a time."

15:43.110 --> 15:44.850
Is that enough hyperbole for you,

15:45.070 --> 15:47.732
or would you like me
to come up with something more vivid?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.940
No. No. That's pretty good.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.699
What is this?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.196
What's going on?

16:36.413 --> 16:39.621
- You all right?
- He just came at me.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.415
Isaac, what the hell did you do?

16:51.636 --> 16:53.297
Sorry about this, Derek.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.469
I asked Kali to be gentle, but...

16:55.682 --> 16:57.388
This is me being gentle.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.140
Let her go.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.319
No.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.732
See? We're not unreasonable.

17:11.948 --> 17:16.157
What do you want? You want to kill me?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.620
You really think
I'm that boring?

17:17.829 --> 17:21.742
Don't throw me in
with sociopaths like your uncle.

17:21.958 --> 17:26.167
I'm a man with far more vision
than simple murder.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.369
In fact,

17:29.508 --> 17:35.094
I'm here to show you just how much vision
a blind man can have.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.343
Don't let it bother you.
It's just lunchtime detention.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.096
If all they want right now is to piss you off,
then don't give in.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.306
They're just trying to get to you.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.479
It's notjust me.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.601
- What about tonight?
- Nope. Studying.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.399
I could help you.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.731
Do you have an IQ higher than 170?

17:55.951 --> 17:58.408
Okay. You could help me.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.534
Tonight then?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.335
What?

18:11.049 --> 18:13.085
Now they're getting to you.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.428
- Wait right here, okay?
- Okay.

18:29.859 --> 18:34.398
Um, hi, Ashley. Hi.
Can I talk to you just for one sec? Sorry.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.817
I just need to ask you something
really quick,

18:37.033 --> 18:39.649
and it's gonna sound
really unbelievably insensitive,

18:39.869 --> 18:42.576
so I apologize in advance. Um...

18:44.416 --> 18:46.532
- Was Kyle a virgin?
- What?

18:46.751 --> 18:49.743
Your boyfriend, was he a virgin,
or did you guys...

18:49.963 --> 18:51.203
You know what! mean...

18:55.302 --> 18:57.634
No, he wasn't a virgin.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.302
Have you completely lost your mind?

19:03.518 --> 19:06.681
I've got four murders, Stiles.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.432
You see those men in there? That's the FBI.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.479
They're pulling together a task force
to help,

19:10.650 --> 19:13.687
because it looks like we've got
a full-blown serial killer on our hands.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.023
- You get that?
- Yes, Dad. I get that.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.446
Then what are you doing?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.699
I'm trying to find a pattern.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.821
You're killing him!

19:26.458 --> 19:28.414
Not yet, little sister.

19:28.627 --> 19:29.867
But I could.

19:31.087 --> 19:36.457
Who knows if it's five minutes or five hours
before it's too late to take this thing out?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.759
But just to be on the safe side,
Duke, you might want to get to the point.

19:39.971 --> 19:43.759
Now you see the one problem
with being in an Alpha pack.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.307
Everybody wants to make the decisions.

19:46.895 --> 19:51.184
Me? I'm more about
discovering new talents.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.646
Like you.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.269
Not interested.

19:54.486 --> 19:57.353
But you haven't even heard my pitch.

19:57.572 --> 20:01.440
You want me to kill my own pack.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.409
No. I want you to kill one of them.

20:05.664 --> 20:09.327
Do that, and I won't have to ask you
to kill the others.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.289
You'll do it on your own.

20:13.505 --> 20:17.123
I did it. Ennis did. Kali did.

20:17.842 --> 20:21.334
Tell him what it's like, Kali,
to kill one of your own.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.839
Mmm...

20:23.515 --> 20:24.721
Liberating.

20:24.933 --> 20:28.425
Listen to her, Derek.
Do you really want to stay beholden

20:28.603 --> 20:32.721
to a couple of maladjusted teenagers
bound to become a liability?

20:32.941 --> 20:36.399
And believe me,
they will become a liability.

20:36.736 --> 20:43.574
In fact, I have a feeling one of them
is getting himself into trouble right now.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.369
The two of you will wash all the boards
in this hall.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.030
Reshelving the library.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.667
Restocking the janitor's closet.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.916
Oh, Mr. Harris?

20:58.883 --> 20:59.872
Um...

21:00.593 --> 21:02.549
Does it have to be with her?

21:02.721 --> 21:04.882
Now that I know you prefer not to,

21:05.056 --> 21:07.923
yes, you have to be with her.

21:09.728 --> 21:10.808
Great.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.821
Whoa. Hey, Boyd!
I didn't know you were back at school.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.244
Yeah, I would have told you,
but we're not actually friends.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.322
Oh, yeah.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.332
Hey, so did you know Kyle?

21:35.503 --> 21:38.165
Yeah, we were in Junior ROTC together.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.496
So you two were friends, then?

21:39.716 --> 21:42.674
I only had one friend. She's dead, too.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.312
Sorry.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.990
Are you okay?

22:12.207 --> 22:16.951
Yeah, yeah,
I'm just not a big fan of small spaces.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.456
Can I ask you a question?

22:19.672 --> 22:23.039
- Do you have to?
- I guess not.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.676
I'm gonna ask anyway.

22:28.056 --> 22:31.139
Did you tell anyone
that I was at the school the other night?

22:32.227 --> 22:34.013
Was I supposed to?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.808
It would make me really happy if you didn't.

22:38.024 --> 22:42.358
Yeah, well, you being happy
really isn't a big priority of mine,

22:42.570 --> 22:47.439
since you stabbed me 20 times with knives.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.444
They were actually
Chinese ring daggers, but...

22:52.705 --> 22:54.491
- Oh.
- Sorry.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.157
Was that an apology?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.413
Would you accept an apology?

22:59.587 --> 23:00.622
Uh...

23:06.302 --> 23:07.382
No, no, no.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.760
Maybe it locked from the outside.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.260
No, there's something up against it.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.721
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, all right. Just relax.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.057
- No.
- Isaac, relax.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.446
- Isaac...
- Come on. Come on.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.776
- Isaac.
- Come on.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.945
Isaac. Isaac! Okay, Isaac. Isaac, just relax.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.076
- Isaac.
- Come on!

23:39.252 --> 23:40.207
No!

23:48.970 --> 23:51.336
Isaac, don't. Don't.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.553
Isaac! Isaac! Isaac!

24:01.065 --> 24:02.601
Isaac!

24:10.074 --> 24:11.280
Allison.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.196
I'm okay. I'm fine.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.778
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
- I'm okay.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.863
I'm so sorry.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.833
- It's not his fault.
- I know.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.583
I guess now we know
they want to do more than get you angry.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.789
They want to get someone hurt.

24:28.635 --> 24:32.002
- So are we gonna do something?
- Yeah.

24:34.098 --> 24:38.933
I'm gonna get them angry, really angry.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.268
You know that there's a temple in Calcutta

24:45.485 --> 24:46.850
where they used
to sacrifice a child every day?

24:47.070 --> 24:48.856
That's every day a dead baby,
Lydia, every day!

24:49.072 --> 24:50.562
Hey, you want to know what today is?
It's dead baby day.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.197
No, wait, that's every day,
'cause every day is dead baby day, yay!

24:53.368 --> 24:54.323
Why are you telling me this?

24:54.494 --> 24:57.861
Because Scott's dealing
with the Alpha twins.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.912
- You don't know about the twins?
- Alphas?

25:00.124 --> 25:01.705
Ethan and Aiden.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.250
Oh, yeah.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.380
- Yeah, I knew about them.
- Okay, okay, good.

25:06.547 --> 25:07.753
So look, here's what I'm thinking.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.376
I'm thinking that the murders
maybe come in threes.

25:09.592 --> 25:10.877
Ancient people love things in threes, right?

25:11.094 --> 25:13.176
So maybe first, it's three virgins,
and then, I don't know,

25:13.388 --> 25:16.130
maybe it's three people
who own little dogs.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.714
I own a little dog.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.057
I am not getting rid of my dog!

25:20.269 --> 25:21.770
Would you just think
about getting rid of your little dog?

25:21.980 --> 25:23.311
No. And by the way,

25:23.523 --> 25:24.854
you cannot discern a pattern
by a single data point,

25:25.066 --> 25:26.272
- so stop trying.
- Okay, so what,

25:26.484 --> 25:28.315
I'm just supposed to wait around
for someone else to die, then?

25:28.528 --> 25:30.268
I'm just supposed to sit there
and watch them die?

25:30.488 --> 25:33.275
Just wait for them to wither up
and die right in front of me?

25:33.491 --> 25:35.152
- Wither?
- You know what I mean.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.984
Die, in just a hideously awful,
strangulating, head-bashed-in,

25:38.204 --> 25:40.365
throat-cutting kind of way.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.455
Maybe it's not yourjob.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.034
You said it yourself.
They were strangled with a garrote.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.586
That's a human thing to do,

25:48.756 --> 25:52.715
so maybe just leave
the figuring it out part to someone human.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.548
You mean someone like my dad?

25:56.723 --> 26:00.636
No, I mean your dad, the sheriff!

26:07.191 --> 26:08.727
How long is this gonna take?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.280
PuII back with your left hand.
Kick down to put in gear.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.232
Front brake. Throttle.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.284
Back brake for stopping.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.362
Try not to crash.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.447
Yeah. Been there, done that.

26:28.337 --> 26:33.127
Okay, everyone,
I know this is the last class of the day.

26:34.218 --> 26:37.381
To be honest, I want to get out of here, too.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.853
Looks kind of important.

26:51.736 --> 26:54.443
I have no idea what this thing does.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.987
Wait. Aiden, don't!

27:15.051 --> 27:16.587
Get off my bike!

27:19.305 --> 27:20.590
No problem.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.101
You have got to be kidding me.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.436
You realize this is gonna result
in a suspension.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.250
- You're out of school early.
- Yeah, free period, actually.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.874
I was just headed home to see my dad.

27:54.090 --> 27:57.127
You know, I guess you probably heard
people are kind of getting murdered again.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.378
It's his job to figure it out.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.131
I gathered as much from the sheriff title.

28:01.347 --> 28:06.137
Yeah, um, you know, but it gets kind of hard
for him to do his job

28:06.352 --> 28:08.593
when he doesn't have all the information.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.896
And we all know he's missing
pretty much half the story here, right?

28:12.108 --> 28:13.268
So I started thinking,

28:13.484 --> 28:16.271
and I remembered someone
who does have a lot of information.

28:16.487 --> 28:20.025
Someone who always seems to know
more than anyone else around here.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.029
You.

28:28.708 --> 28:33.202
See, the reason I'm always invested
in new talent is simple.

28:33.838 --> 28:38.298
We all know a pack is strongest due
to its individual parts.

28:38.509 --> 28:42.627
The stronger the individual parts,
the greater the whole.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.299
When I lost my sight,

28:47.518 --> 28:50.851
one of my Betas assumed
I wasn't fit for my role anymore.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.803
He tried to take it from me.

28:54.483 --> 28:59.352
Killing him taught me something
about Alphas I didn't know they could do.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.029
His power was added to mine.

29:03.242 --> 29:08.453
I became stronger, faster,
more powerful than I'd ever been.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.869
I tested this new ability
to subsume the power of your own

29:12.084 --> 29:14.291
by killing another one.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.370
In fact, I killed them all.

29:17.590 --> 29:22.926
I took the individual parts
and became a greater individual whole.

29:38.694 --> 29:42.562
Hmm. You're right, Kali.
He looks like his mother.

29:45.660 --> 29:48.868
You'll get to know me, Derek, like she did.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.744
I know you. I know what you are.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.166
You're a fanatic.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.840
Know me?

30:05.680 --> 30:09.298
You've never seen anything like me.

30:09.517 --> 30:13.305
I am the Alpha of Alphas.

30:13.521 --> 30:17.309
I am the apex of apex predators!

30:17.525 --> 30:21.484
I am death, destroyer of worlds!

30:21.946 --> 30:25.689
I am the demon wolf!

30:36.502 --> 30:38.458
Hate it when that happens.

31:10.494 --> 31:13.361
Wow, that's, like, really good.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.071
I know, right?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.282
You should be in art class.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.163
- Maybe.
- Since you're not in music.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.170
- Fifteen minutes!
- What?

31:27.845 --> 31:29.961
- What's that?
- 15 minute rule.

31:30.139 --> 31:32.221
The teacher didn't show up.

32:12.056 --> 32:15.264
Recording piano, part three.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.486
All these symbols and things,
the triskeles, the bank logo,

33:18.706 --> 33:20.822
the Mountain Ash,
all of it is from the Celtic Druids.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.293
And anyone who has ever
looked up human sacrifice before

33:23.502 --> 33:25.083
knows that the Druids
had a pretty big hard-on

33:25.296 --> 33:26.786
when it came to giving one up to the gods.

33:27.006 --> 33:30.544
You ever hear of the Lindow Man?
2,000-year-old body found in England?

33:30.759 --> 33:34.377
He was found strangled, head bashed in,
throat cut. Threefold death.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.133
They also found pollen grains
in his stomach.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.298
Guess what favorite Druid plant that was.

33:43.522 --> 33:47.140
I'm just telling you everything
you already know, aren't I?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.850
Then why aren't you telling us?

33:51.197 --> 33:54.109
Maybe because when you've spent
every moment of the last 10 years

33:54.283 --> 33:56.194
trying to push something away...

33:57.661 --> 33:59.492
Denying it.

34:01.415 --> 34:03.155
Lying about it.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.950
Becomes a pretty powerful habit.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.754
All right, so this guy, is he a Druid?

34:11.967 --> 34:12.956
No.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.550
It's someone copying
a centuries-old practice

34:15.763 --> 34:18.095
of a people who should have known better.

34:18.265 --> 34:20.881
Do you know what the word
"druid" means in Gaelic?

34:21.101 --> 34:24.468
- No.
- Wise oak.

34:24.688 --> 34:29.432
The Celtic Druids were close to nature.
They believed they kept it in balance.

34:29.652 --> 34:34.271
They were philosophers and scholars.
They weren't serial killers.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.106
Yeah, well, this one is.

34:41.372 --> 34:42.828
Hey, I can't talk right now.

34:44.458 --> 34:48.246
Wait, what?
Okay, are you sure he's missing?

34:48.462 --> 34:51.124
Not just missing, taken.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.262
Can we get a copy of this?

35:01.934 --> 35:06.018
Hey, Doc, any help would be,
you know, helpful.

35:06.230 --> 35:09.267
Each grouping of three
would have its own purpose,

35:09.858 --> 35:11.723
its own type of power.

35:11.944 --> 35:16.608
Virgins, healers, philosophers, warriors...

35:16.824 --> 35:19.281
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Warrior, could that also be like a soldier?

35:19.493 --> 35:21.108
Absolutely.

35:23.497 --> 35:26.330
Kyle was in ROTC with Boyd.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.407
That's got to be it. That's the pattern.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.037
- Where's Boyd?
- He's probably home right now.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.453
I'm gonna try to get him on the phone.

35:33.591 --> 35:36.458
Lydia? Something wrong?

35:37.511 --> 35:40.878
No, it was... I mean...

35:41.098 --> 35:43.089
I just thought of someone else
with a military connection.

35:43.267 --> 35:44.598
Who?

36:21.347 --> 36:24.180
Yeah, I wish I could have seen their faces.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.716
- They look seriously pissed?
- Yeah.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.390
Kind of like that.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.090
We can take them.

37:03.097 --> 37:05.258
Are you kidding? Isaac!

37:59.486 --> 38:01.442
Who the hell is that?

38:04.491 --> 38:05.697
Deucalion.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.325
This is just one
of many possibilities.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.486
He could have simply left for the day.

38:10.664 --> 38:13.531
Yeah, well, not without this.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.458
- What?
- This test is graded R.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.340
This one's an H.

38:42.279 --> 38:46.318
Stiles, you remember I told you "druid"
is the Gaelic word for "wise oak"?

38:46.492 --> 38:47.698
Yeah.

38:48.786 --> 38:51.368
If a Druid went down the wrong path,

38:51.538 --> 38:55.326
the wise oak was sometimes said
to have become a dark oak.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.538
There's a Gaelic word for that as well,

39:00.964 --> 39:01.999
Darach.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.809
I don't get it.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.936
Well, did something happen?

39:22.820 --> 39:25.232
It's just not gonna work
with both of you here.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.233
I've got Cora now. It's too much.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.440
I need you out tonight.

39:31.829 --> 39:34.115
Where am I supposed to go?

39:35.415 --> 39:36.951
Somewhere else.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.585
Did I do something wrong, Derek?

39:43.215 --> 39:45.126
You're doing something wrong
right now by not leaving.

39:45.342 --> 39:46.297
- Come on.
- Just get out.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.296
- Derek, please.
- Get out.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.592
- Come on.
- Go!

40:22.004 --> 40:23.835
Come in, Mom.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.339
I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.432
Please! Don't do this!

40:51.491 --> 40:55.075
I did what you asked. I did everything!

40:55.704 --> 40:58.946
They'll figure this out,
and they're gonna find you.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.952
You still need me!
