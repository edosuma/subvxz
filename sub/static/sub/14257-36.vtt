21:01.760 --> 21:02.860
Who cares?

21:02.862 --> 21:06.096
I'm channel 6's new
star reporter now.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.631
Oh, of all the low-down,

21:07.633 --> 21:10.233
back-stabbing,
double-dealing--

21:10.235 --> 21:11.902
chill out, dudettes.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.771
The whole world's
got his <i> numero.</i>

21:14.773 --> 21:16.106
Right.
He'll be lucky

21:16.108 --> 21:18.108
if he can
keep his own job.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.944
Yeah, once it gets out
that he totally blew

21:20.946 --> 21:22.779
the story of the century.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.747
Just what are you
blabbering about?

21:25.983 --> 21:28.385
Looks like you forgot to
take the lens cap off,

21:28.387 --> 21:30.287
Mr. star reporter.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.223
I don't believe it.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.859
All that incredible
footage gone!

21:35.861 --> 21:37.694
Uh-huh. Just like
your chances

21:37.696 --> 21:39.563
of stealing my job.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.198
