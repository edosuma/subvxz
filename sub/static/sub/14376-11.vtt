00:48.166 --> 00:50.450
What is wrong
with this machine?

00:51.233 --> 00:52.350
Come on.

00:52.383 --> 00:55.483
It's been 10 minutes,
and I have had no alien contact!

00:56.016 --> 00:57.083
Hi, Dexter!

00:57.116 --> 01:00.016
Can you get miss Brenda
some sugar for her tea?

01:00.050 --> 01:02.266
Sure. One lump or 2?
Huh?

01:02.300 --> 01:04.166
Dee Dee,
what are you doing

01:04.200 --> 01:05.333
inside of my
alien communicator?

01:05.366 --> 01:09.200
I'm having a tea party,
you silly.

01:09.233 --> 01:12.200
Will you get out
of my machine?!

01:12.233 --> 01:14.166
Fine.

01:14.416 --> 01:17.316
Miss Brenda doesn't
like you, anyway.

01:17.350 --> 01:21.183
Now let us see
if this thing will work.

01:36.250 --> 01:42.200
Hooray! The aliens have landed!
The aliens have landed!

01:43.033 --> 01:47.150
Welcome to Dexter's laboratory.

[Speaking alien language]

01:51.466 --> 01:52.433
Oh, wait a second.

01:52.466 --> 01:56.266
I forgot to use
my audio translator.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.233
Ok. Ready to go.

01:59.266 --> 02:00.366
As you can see,

02:00.400 --> 02:04.066
only a human with
an ingenious I.Q.
Like myself

02:04.100 --> 02:08.466
could have built
such a spectacle
of science.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.316
I'm sorry,
but here in the lab,

02:11.350 --> 02:14.033
we give
each other 3 feet
of personal space.

02:14.066 --> 02:17.466
You will come with us, human,
for further examination.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.050
Yipe!

02:22.016 --> 02:23.200
Hi!

02:23.233 --> 02:24.166
Dee Dee,
what are you--

02:24.200 --> 02:26.000
hmm. Interesting
specimen.

02:26.033 --> 02:30.366
I mean, Dee Dee,
so good of you
to join us.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.033
Who are your
funny-looking friends?

02:36.266 --> 02:37.400
Eugh!

Dee Dee,
these are my friends
from far away.

02:41.216 --> 02:44.033
They're going on a trip
to, uh, candyland.

02:44.066 --> 02:47.400
I would go, but I
don't want to get
experimented on.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.166
I mean, um, uh...

02:49.200 --> 02:50.166
I'm not hungry.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.150
Candyland? Let's go!

02:54.183 --> 02:57.183
Ooh! Pretty light!

03:01.350 --> 03:03.350
Now where's that candy?

03:03.383 --> 03:06.233
[Speaking
alien language]

03:06.266 --> 03:09.433
Bye, Dee Dee!
Bye-bye!

03:09.466 --> 03:12.333
Finally I am rid
of my sister forever,

03:12.366 --> 03:18.133
and I can enjoy conducting
my experiments in peace.

03:25.283 --> 03:30.266
Ahh! Sweet silence.

03:34.266 --> 03:35.333
Heh heh heh.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.033
Hey, mom,
what's for dinner?

03:41.066 --> 03:45.450
Well, Dexter,
creamed corn
and sliced Dee Dee.

03:45.483 --> 03:49.200
Dexter, could you
help me set the table?

03:49.233 --> 03:52.450
Uh, sure, mom.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.333
Dexter, have you
seen your sister?

04:02.366 --> 04:07.266
Uh, she went to spend the night
at her friend's place.

04:12.100 --> 04:15.116
Mo...mom, may I
be excused?

04:15.150 --> 04:18.400
But, honey,
you haven't even
touched your food.

04:18.433 --> 04:22.283
I'm not very hungry.

04:28.266 --> 04:33.050
It is very lonely here
without you.

the candy is hiding?

Did you come to get
some candy, too?

06:49.166 --> 06:51.466
No, I came
to take you home.

Well, we're not leaving
until we get some candy!

to take a shower.

09:29.150 --> 09:32.266
We went into the basement
to fix a clog in the pipe,

09:32.300 --> 09:33.450
and we saw something
down there.

09:33.483 --> 09:35.233
It was nasty, dude.
You got to help us.

09:35.266 --> 09:40.050
All right. All right.
Just get off of me, will you?
I'm naked!

09:44.200 --> 09:46.333

vigilante of all time!

Behold my cavernous rat cave.

09:57.466 --> 10:01.016
Uh, dude, I think you're
a little confused, dude.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.150
This is our basement.

10:02.183 --> 10:07.066
Nonsense!
Do not attempt your
clever ruse on me.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.016
Quickly identify
yourselves

10:09.050 --> 10:12.166
before I am forced
to take extreme action!

10:12.200 --> 10:15.433
Why, we're
the justice friends,
of course.

10:15.466 --> 10:18.083
We're superheroes.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.066
And this
is our basement,

10:21.100 --> 10:22.350
so you'd better
start explaining

10:22.383 --> 10:24.283
what you're doing
down here.

10:24.316 --> 10:25.483
It all started long ago.

10:26.016 --> 10:31.233
There I was,
a mere child of 30,
living with my parents--

10:31.266 --> 10:33.000
a happy family.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.416
It was movie night.
We had just seen<i>Ben,</i>

10:35.450 --> 10:38.466
and I must admit, I was
a little excited by the film

10:39.000 --> 10:41.233
and was jumping around
like a giddy schoolgirl

10:41.266 --> 10:48.000
when a large sewer rat
emerged from the depths of
the hideous underground...

10:48.033 --> 10:49.083
Aah! Aah!

10:49.116 --> 10:53.316
Scaring both
of my parents away...

10:53.350 --> 10:56.483
Forever!

10:57.016 --> 10:59.066
Leaving me,
a mere child of 30,

10:59.100 --> 11:02.233
to fend for myself
in the cruel city.

11:02.266 --> 11:05.250
Fortunately for me,
the rats took me in,

11:05.283 --> 11:09.166
cared for me, fed me,
and clothed me,

11:09.200 --> 11:11.083
taught me the way of the rodent,

11:11.116 --> 11:13.150
got me into
top physical condition,

11:13.183 --> 11:15.100
and even sent me
to vocational school.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.416
Alas, I inherited
their vast fortune,

11:17.450 --> 11:24.350
thus becoming ratman--
feared creature of the night.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.233
You are a very
disturbed little man.

11:30.266 --> 11:31.300
You do know that,
don't you?

11:31.333 --> 11:34.066
Uh, wait, dude.
Your story
don't add up.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.433
I mean, aren't the rats
the ones who scared
your parents away?

11:37.466 --> 11:40.450
Then, what? Ratman,
what's the motivation
here?

11:41.000 --> 11:45.133
Are you, um, like,
avenging your parents,
or...

11:45.166 --> 11:46.216
What do you mean?

11:46.250 --> 11:50.250
I got the costume, the belt.
What's not to get?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.300
The generator!
It's about to blow!

11:53.333 --> 11:56.116
Justice friends,
assemble!

11:57.083 --> 11:58.033
Attack!

11:58.066 --> 11:59.383

12:02.083 --> 12:04.033

12:04.066 --> 12:06.400
Huh? Grr!

12:06.433 --> 12:09.000

12:18.100 --> 12:19.116
Whoo!

12:19.150 --> 12:21.050
Will you guys quit playing
with the boiler?

12:21.083 --> 12:23.266
I'm trying to tell you
my origins story.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.150
No! No!

12:29.366 --> 12:30.366
Awesome!

12:30.400 --> 12:31.183
Wow.

12:31.216 --> 12:32.400
Now, where was I?

12:32.433 --> 12:36.150
Oh, yeah. The hideous,
cruel, dark blackness
of the night.

12:36.183 --> 12:41.433
So, Mr. Ratman,
they tell me you're
a crime fighter, eh?

12:41.466 --> 12:42.400
Huh?

12:42.433 --> 12:44.316
Of course
I'm a crime fighter!

12:44.350 --> 12:47.033
What the heck have
I been talking about?

12:47.066 --> 12:49.233
Well, how would you
like to become a member

12:49.266 --> 12:53.033

crime-fighting team
in the biz--

12:53.066 --> 12:55.233

12:55.266 --> 12:57.016
How much does it pay?

12:57.050 --> 13:00.200
Well, we pay standard
journeyman scale for
superhero crime fighters

13:00.233 --> 13:02.066
plus a health,
dental...

13:02.100 --> 13:03.050
Hmm.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.383
And vision plan.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.400
Cool!

13:07.416 --> 13:09.066
Psych!

13:09.100 --> 13:10.333
Just joshin'.

13:10.366 --> 13:11.400
Heh heh heh!

13:11.433 --> 13:14.016
So what's first
on the agenda?

13:14.050 --> 13:15.066
Let's get cracking.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.100
Now, now,
don't you worry,
little man.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.383
We've got a very
special job for you.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.083
Uh! Oh, I'm beat.

13:23.116 --> 13:26.100
What a battle!

13:26.133 --> 13:27.300
Krunk sore!

13:27.333 --> 13:31.366
All I want to do
is chill and watch
the tube.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.116
You can depend
on dippy diapers.

13:35.150 --> 13:38.316
If your baby's drippy,
just say dippy.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.283
[Static]

13:46.450 --> 13:48.366
Ratman is here!

13:48.400 --> 13:52.333
Show yourself,
evil scourge of justice!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.316
Gee, it's been
kind of slow lately.

13:55.350 --> 13:59.250
I mean, the blender last week,
the toaster before that.

13:59.283 --> 14:02.166
Where's all the archvillains
and psychopathic killers?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.450
I'm ready.
I can take them all.

14:04.483 --> 14:06.316
I got all these cool things...

14:13.100 --> 14:14.116
Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

14:14.150 --> 14:16.366
I heard
this great joke!
Ha ha ha!

14:16.400 --> 14:17.416
Ok. Here it goes.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.216
A physics professor
and his assistant

14:20.250 --> 14:21.416
were working
on liberating

14:21.450 --> 14:23.350
negatively charged
hydroxyl ions

14:23.383 --> 14:27.066
when all of a sudden
the assistant says,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.016
"wait, professor.

14:28.050 --> 14:29.450
"What if
the salicylic acids

14:29.483 --> 14:31.216
don't accept
the hydroxyl ion?"

14:31.250 --> 14:33.466
And the professor
responds,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.400
"that's no hydroxyl ion,
that's my wife."

14:37.433 --> 14:40.200
Ha ha ha!

14:58.383 --> 15:00.300
Hey, Earl. How's life
treating you?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.416
Don't ask.

15:01.450 --> 15:04.283
Too late.
I already did.

15:04.316 --> 15:07.283
Let's see.
What do we have here?

15:07.316 --> 15:09.200
Anything for me?
Anything for me?

15:09.233 --> 15:10.366
Anything for me?

15:10.400 --> 15:12.416
What about me?
Anything for me?

15:12.450 --> 15:14.366
Why do you always
copy me?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.366
Look, hon. There's
some mail here

15:16.400 --> 15:19.366
for our little man
of the family.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.050
Oh, cool!

15:24.083 --> 15:25.400
What is this?

15:25.433 --> 15:27.000
Publishers sweepinghouse?

15:27.033 --> 15:30.450
Dee Dee, there is
one here for you, too.

15:31.316 --> 15:33.033
Oh, boy!
I could be eligible

15:33.066 --> 15:37.150
for a chance at
winning an opportunity
to be eligible to win--

15:37.183 --> 15:39.116
do you know
what the odds are

15:39.150 --> 15:40.416
of you winning
something like that?

15:40.450 --> 15:42.133
You have got
a better chance

15:42.166 --> 15:45.400
of finding it
on the playground.

15:48.283 --> 15:50.200
A bill?

15:52.483 --> 15:55.466
200 million?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.033
But I'm just a kid.

15:57.066 --> 15:59.000
Where am I going to find
that kind of money?

15:59.033 --> 16:04.133
Place the stamp here
for a free clock
with 10 purchases.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.416
Dad, we need to have
a talk, man-to-man.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.216
Yeah, sure, son.

16:09.250 --> 16:13.100
Publishers sweepinghouse
will have you saying
"it's fun to be rich."

16:13.133 --> 16:14.133
Ho ho ho!

16:14.166 --> 16:16.233
It's about
my allowance.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.466
Pay attention, dad.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.366
Now, if you started me
at the rate of 5 cents
a week at age 4

16:20.400 --> 16:23.416
but in 9 months of that
year it was raised to
10 cents a week,

16:23.450 --> 16:27.083
ok, if it would
continue to raise at
an exponential rate

16:27.116 --> 16:29.183
compounded with
the rate of inflation...

16:29.216 --> 16:31.066
Sounds fair.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.166
And furthermore
factoring in

16:32.200 --> 16:35.283
the survey of the other
kids in the neighborhood

16:35.316 --> 16:38.166
averaged into the statistics
of allowance rates

16:38.200 --> 16:40.250
not only here
in this country,

16:40.283 --> 16:41.350
but all over the world,

16:41.383 --> 16:45.250
I should be making
$1.5 million weekly.

16:45.283 --> 16:48.016
Hmm. Can't argue
with the facts,

16:48.050 --> 16:50.200
but you'll have
to settle for

16:50.233 --> 16:54.333
a quarter of a million
this time, champ.

16:54.366 --> 16:55.150
Drat!

16:55.183 --> 16:56.266
What about me?

16:56.300 --> 16:59.050
Well, according
to Dexter's charts
and graphs,

16:59.083 --> 17:03.000
you should get 5 bucks
because you're older.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.250
Hi, Dexter!

17:21.283 --> 17:22.250
[Telephone rings]

17:22.283 --> 17:26.066
Mother: Dexter, telephone!

17:26.100 --> 17:27.183
Hello?

17:27.216 --> 17:30.050
Man: This is
the NASA payment
collection agency.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.250
We still haven't
received your
payment here.

17:32.283 --> 17:34.050
Did you
get our notice?

17:34.083 --> 17:37.066
Uh, I don't think so.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.450
I don't see it here.

17:38.483 --> 17:40.000
I've been busy here.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.183
I have been having trouble
getting my mail,

17:42.216 --> 17:44.200
and I have to leave
the country.

17:44.233 --> 17:45.300
Ok. Well, do you know

17:45.333 --> 17:48.150
that you only have 2 days
left to pay it, then?

17:48.183 --> 17:50.033
But the notice says
I've got 10 days!

17:50.066 --> 17:53.200
Oh, so you<i>did</i>
receive our notice,
then?

17:53.233 --> 17:55.066
Drat!

17:56.133 --> 17:58.200
What you doing,
Dexter?

17:58.233 --> 18:00.033
Huh? Get out of here,
Dee Dee.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.166
I am trying
to have a sale
and make some cash.

18:02.200 --> 18:06.150
A sale? Well, I'm going
to have a sale, too.

18:06.183 --> 18:07.400
So?

18:07.433 --> 18:09.466
Go ahead.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.150
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen,

18:11.183 --> 18:13.383
for the finest
in home electronics--

18:13.416 --> 18:16.333
time traveler,
atomic smashing devices.

18:16.366 --> 18:18.183
Come on up.
Don't be shy.

18:18.216 --> 18:19.300
What can I do you for?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.316
Uh, yeah. How much
for this cool glowy
thingy?

18:22.350 --> 18:24.000
That, my good friend,

18:24.033 --> 18:26.000
is no mere
glowing thingy,

18:26.033 --> 18:27.133
but a nuclear
nitroliquid.

18:27.166 --> 18:30.483
Oh, I just wanted
a cool glowing thingy.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.016
[Woman screaming]

18:35.050 --> 18:36.033
[Sirens]

18:36.066 --> 18:38.150
Hmm. I better
take care of that later.

18:38.183 --> 18:42.133
Hey, mister, how much
for the giant ant?

18:42.166 --> 18:44.433
How much for the cool
glowing thingy?

18:44.466 --> 18:46.300
A dollar.

18:46.333 --> 18:50.183
How much for the video
game patterns book?

18:50.216 --> 18:54.183
Heh heh heh.
That one's not for sale.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.350
We shall take
your light converters.

18:57.383 --> 19:00.200
Fine. That will be 14.99
for the pair.

19:00.233 --> 19:05.166
I said we shall<i>take</i>
your light converters.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.300
Like I said, take them,
they're yours.

19:08.333 --> 19:13.083
$6.00, $7.00, $8.00
and 41, 42, 43--

19:13.116 --> 19:16.250
how'd you do, Dexter?

19:16.283 --> 19:19.233
I'll do your homework.
I guarantee an "a."

19:19.266 --> 19:21.483
The price?
Only $2,000 a page.

19:22.016 --> 19:23.133
Oh! No, no, no, no!

19:23.166 --> 19:26.383
Fine, then! See if
you graduate Harvard
by yourself!

19:26.416 --> 19:28.466
[Doorbell rings]

19:29.000 --> 19:31.166
It's dek McMahon!

19:31.200 --> 19:35.183
Dee Dee, there's someone
here to see you!

19:35.216 --> 19:37.100
Here you go, Dee Dee.

19:37.133 --> 19:39.300
You're our
$200 million winner.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.116
Ho ho ho!

19:41.150 --> 19:43.183
Holy cow!

19:43.216 --> 19:45.316
What do you say,
Dee Dee?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.450
Thanks!

19:46.483 --> 19:50.083
No problem, Dee Dee.
Just put it
in a safe spot.

19:50.116 --> 19:52.050
I will!

19:52.083 --> 19:54.333
This is ridiculous!

19:54.366 --> 19:57.333
I need to make some loot!

20:05.350 --> 20:06.300
Oh, boy!

20:06.333 --> 20:12.133
Now only $199,900,999
left to go.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.250
[Doorbell rings]

20:13.283 --> 20:19.050
Dexter, there's some men
from NASA here to see you.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.466
Uh, tell them
I'll be right down.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.300
[Teeth chattering]

20:30.350 --> 20:33.016
She does have more than enough.

20:33.050 --> 20:34.116
[Gasps]

20:34.150 --> 20:36.316
But what if I get caught?

20:36.350 --> 20:37.483
Oh!

20:38.016 --> 20:41.016
No, no. I will never resort
to stealing.

20:41.050 --> 20:43.266
A man of my stature
and intelligence

20:43.300 --> 20:46.150
would never resort
to common thievery.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.266
Dexter!

20:51.183 --> 20:52.316
[Sighs]

20:52.350 --> 20:57.133
Oh, Dexter, you know I would
have loaned you the money...

20:57.166 --> 21:01.450
If only you had just asked.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.033
Oh, the shame!

21:05.066 --> 21:07.066
Would it be ok
if I asked you now

21:07.100 --> 21:11.416
if it would be ok
if I could please
borrow the money?

21:11.450 --> 21:13.316
May I please
borrow the money?

21:13.350 --> 21:18.416
Um...ok, but only
under one condition.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.133
Dee Dee, keep your
things out of my side
of the lab!
