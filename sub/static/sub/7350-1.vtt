WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:07.808
*

00:07.841 --> 00:11.112
That there's rent,
drinking money,

00:11.145 --> 00:14.348
maybe even a down payment
on a truck.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.117
*

00:16.150 --> 00:18.119
Now, that's a catch.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.787
That's trouble, Dale.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.390
You know better
than to mess with Amy.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.358
Hey, Macey...

00:24.392 --> 00:25.626
Don't "Hey, Macey" me.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.761
You the one sleeping with her?
What? No.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.297
She ain't even my type.
Ain't that right, Jesse?

00:29.330 --> 00:30.631
Oh, I'll pop your head off

00:30.664 --> 00:32.433
just like one of them shrimp.
Do you hear me?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.169
What do you got
to say for yourself,

00:35.203 --> 00:37.305
you sorry son of a bitch, huh?!

00:37.338 --> 00:39.373
Leg.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.541
Ooh.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.579
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:45.613 --> 00:48.282
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:48.316 --> 00:50.684
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:50.718 --> 00:52.120
* How, how, how, how

00:52.153 --> 00:54.422
* Hey, hey

01:00.294 --> 01:01.662
* You gotta come on.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.334
Haven't gotten used to the
Crescent City nightlife, Brody?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.868
It's my living situation.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.704
Short-term lease
in a double in Broadmoor.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.607
Every night the same thing:
wasted college students

01:13.641 --> 01:16.610
and neighborhood kids
lighting firecrackers.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.679
You know those
aren't firecrackers.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.681
I was trying
to be optimistic.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.683
Oh, someone party hard
last night?

01:22.716 --> 01:23.817
Noisy neighbors.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.286
Oh, I'm just
hazing her.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.754
I know Brody
doesn't go out.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.689
I go out.
I mean, maybe not

01:28.722 --> 01:30.891
to the places where fine dining
meets hurricanes,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.293
but I do go out.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.527
Yeah, sure,
you do, Brody.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.496
All right, Christopher,
what we got?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.631
Boot is current Navy issue,
so we're operating

01:37.665 --> 01:39.833
on the assumption
the leg is as well.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.470
Dwayne. Christopher.
Morning.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.737
Agent Brody,
you look tired.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.373
I hope it was
worth it.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.675
Loud kids. Gunshots.
Not worth it.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.510
Hey, don't sweat it, Brody--
from now on,

01:49.543 --> 01:51.379
I'm gonna act
as your personal rental agent.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.281
Just like I did
with my sister.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.748
Find you a place
you're gonna love.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.850
Where we at
with I.D.'ing the...

01:56.884 --> 01:58.619
catch of the day, Loretta?

01:58.652 --> 02:00.754
DNA'll take time.
Unfortunately,

02:00.788 --> 02:04.725
there's no identifying
characteristics other than...

02:06.660 --> 02:07.861
...the victim's most
likely African-American.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.730
Based on the
decomp, I'd say

02:09.763 --> 02:11.832
the leg's been in the
water at least a week.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.301
Gator attack?

02:13.334 --> 02:14.735
Muscle cut's too clean.

02:14.768 --> 02:15.736
Boating accident?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.371
Angry shark?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.906
Rabid squid?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.375
Mutant starfish from hell?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.178
Just trying to keep it light.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.580
Based on the marks on the bones,

02:26.614 --> 02:28.749
I'd say it's inconsistent
with a propeller

02:28.782 --> 02:31.619
or a mutant starfish, but...

02:31.652 --> 02:33.454
I think it's a single blade.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.623
Have to autopsy to make sure.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.890
All right, Christopher,

02:36.924 --> 02:38.859
take our recent
Midwestern transplant

02:38.892 --> 02:40.394
and introduce her
to the Coast Guard,

02:40.428 --> 02:42.530
get them to help
in the search.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.432
Let's find the rest of him.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.502
You got it, King.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.504
*

02:58.379 --> 03:01.549
Captain Lee.
Pride.

03:01.582 --> 03:05.253
Just couldn't stay
away from my gumbo, could you?

03:05.286 --> 03:08.556
Oh, how I wish I were here for
a little culinary inspiration.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.492
Hope you don't mind--
your guard let me in.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.626
No problem.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.628
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

03:14.662 --> 03:15.996
but the kid you mentored,

03:16.029 --> 03:18.666
Petty Officer 2nd Class
Calvin Parks,

03:18.699 --> 03:20.701
he's unauthorized absence.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.503
You sure?

03:22.536 --> 03:25.273
His OIC hasn't heard from
him for a couple of days.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.642
I was hoping he
contacted you.
Couple of days?

03:28.676 --> 03:31.379
He told me himself just
how much you helped him out

03:31.412 --> 03:32.680
by steering him
towards the Navy.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.348
Not many people
would help a boy

03:34.382 --> 03:36.250
escape a past like his.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.352
Yeah, well, Calvin
would have found his own way.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.920
I just gave him a little push.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.922
Yeah, well,
you should be proud of him.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.625
That kid's been a squared-away
sailor since day one.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.595
He probably just found
some young lady to distract him.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.798
But if that's the case,

03:50.831 --> 03:53.334
he will be facing
disciplinary action.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.602
Give me a call

03:54.635 --> 03:56.304
if you hear from him, will you?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.905
Yeah. I will.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.940
Good to see you, Pride.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.816
Loretta.
I have a strange request.

04:08.849 --> 04:12.853
Not as strange as a boot
with a leg on my autopsy table.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.456
Could you use the size
of a victim's foot

04:15.489 --> 04:17.825
as a basis
for a general description?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.460
Hey, Pride.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.429
Or should I say "Dwayne"?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.063
I thought it might be
more appropriate for me

04:23.096 --> 04:24.732
to start calling you Dwayne,
what with us

04:24.765 --> 04:26.467
consulting for NCIS
all these years.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.869
After all, the use of first
names is a sign of familiarity,

04:28.902 --> 04:31.472
and we're a far cry from when
the surname was an indication

04:31.505 --> 04:33.006
of a man's trade, so...
Sebastian.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.075
I'll stick
with Pride, for now.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.011
Yeah. Uh, anyway,
I started a computer simulation

04:38.045 --> 04:39.947
to estimate height,
weight and age of the deceased

04:39.980 --> 04:42.015
in case the body
was never found.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.352
Then let me ask you...

04:44.385 --> 04:45.853
could it be a...

04:45.886 --> 04:48.622
23

04:48.656 --> 04:51.892
Six, three; maybe 220 or...

04:51.925 --> 04:53.761
225 pounds?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.730
It's possible, even likely.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.868
I'll send you
a name and a photo.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.516
*

05:32.500 --> 05:35.503
Yeah, baby.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.105
Let's take

05:38.138 --> 05:40.741
a quick five, all right?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.446
:
Dwayne! My man!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.948
Papa Parks.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.851
You sounded good.
You want to sit
in next set?

05:50.884 --> 05:53.687
Have you... have you heard
from Calvin lately?

05:53.721 --> 05:55.723
Uh, it's been at least
a couple weeks.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.426
He'd come over for supper. Why?

05:58.459 --> 06:01.495
You know I think
the world of Calvin.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.832
He's like my blood,
the son I never had.
Dwayne...

06:04.865 --> 06:06.600
just tell me.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.636
Something...

06:08.669 --> 06:11.104
might have happened to Calvin,
something bad.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.675
But you're not sure?
Mm-mm.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.510
I'm not sure.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.712
MAN:
Papa, we're up again.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.184
Only two things
I ever loved in this life:

06:24.217 --> 06:26.487
Calvin and jazz.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.722
Gonna hold on tight

06:28.756 --> 06:30.724
to one...

06:30.758 --> 06:33.060
and pray I haven't
lost the other.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.499
MAN:
All right, Papa!

06:52.245 --> 06:55.516
*

07:11.799 --> 07:14.167
*

07:32.653 --> 07:34.588
LASALLE:
Yo, Pride, you here?

07:34.622 --> 07:35.823
Kitchen.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.126
BRODY:
Wow! Smells good!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.561
Morning, King.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.995
What time you get in?

07:42.029 --> 07:43.964
Well, that assumes I left.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.833
You know I've been
staying upstairs.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.270
Eggs Creole...

07:50.303 --> 07:52.606
andouille sausage
and remoulade sauce.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.907
Nice.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.809
Grab plates,
and tell me where we are

07:55.843 --> 07:57.511
with the Calvin Parks
investigation.

07:57.545 --> 08:01.081
So, last night we went down
and searched his rack.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.550
Nothing out
of the ordinary,

08:02.583 --> 08:04.985
but we did recover
a personal laptop.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.987
Password
Which we've sent out

08:07.020 --> 08:08.856
to get a work-around.
Meantime, we thought

08:08.889 --> 08:10.791
we'd canvass
his day-to-day contacts.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.126
He was assigned
to the pier-side
Fleet Logistics Center.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.062
LASALLE:
He worked the wharfs,
loading inventory,

08:15.095 --> 08:16.630
food and equip.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.265
Okay, you two
take the wharfs.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.800
I'll go see

08:19.833 --> 08:21.969
Doc Wade about forensics.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.237
: Let me talk
to him for a second.
Yep.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.006
Just gonna go...

08:26.039 --> 08:27.741
grab my... phone.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.213
Pride, I can take the morgue,
if you like.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.750
I thought since... you
were personally involved,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.986
you might want
to take a pass on this one.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.188
Got a decade-old
friendship with Papa.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.157
You think I'm just
gonna sit on my hands?

08:44.191 --> 08:46.794
And if the things
we uncover

08:46.827 --> 08:48.962
are things you and he
don't want to hear?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.264
We face what
we got to face.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.733
Take Brody,

08:52.766 --> 08:54.668
learn things.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.573
What the hell
you waiting for?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.941
Well, you did offer breakfast.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.211
We'll take it to go.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.250
BRODY:
You're the longshoremen
supervisor-- and that's...

09:10.283 --> 09:13.153
a civilian position?
Contractor, yeah.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.923
Port is zoned mixed-use,
so... we have various clients,

09:15.956 --> 09:17.324
which include the Navy.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.193
And you oversaw
Petty Officer Parks?
Cal.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.730
Yeah. Good kid.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.998
Great kid. On time.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.300
Polite. Hard-working.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.069
Something more?

09:29.102 --> 09:31.939
I don't want to speak
ill, you know?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.975
But... maybe old
habits die hard.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.345
Hey!

09:38.378 --> 09:39.680
What in the
kingdom of God

09:39.713 --> 09:41.615
are you two doing

09:41.649 --> 09:43.951
Get over to Governor
Nicholls Street Wharf,

09:43.984 --> 09:46.053
off-load those pallets.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.221
Got to keep an eye
on the chuckleheads.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.025
You said, uh,
something about "old habits."
Yeah, just,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.895
uh... just heard talk from
guys on Calvin's shift.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.931
They said that they saw
him leave in a lowrider

09:57.965 --> 09:59.667
with some local bangers.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.268
Bangers are gang members.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.372
My background is
in interrogation,

10:05.405 --> 10:07.107
out of Detroit.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.377
I know the lingo. Thanks.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.179
Anyone get a look
at any of these...

10:12.212 --> 10:13.981
bangers?

10:14.014 --> 10:14.982
Like I said,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.249
I wasn't there to see this,

10:16.283 --> 10:17.951
but... the guys said

10:17.985 --> 10:19.920
that, uh, they didn't
look too friendly.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.255
WADE:
Body was discovered

10:22.289 --> 10:24.391
wrapped in plastic
in a shallow grave

10:24.424 --> 10:26.393
near Highway 11.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.729
New Orleans East.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.698
Highway 11 is near
the Irish Bayou.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.865
That channels
into Lake Pontchartrain.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.100
The leg was scooped up
in the Gulf.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.735
How does that make sense?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.837
I don't even know
what the weapon is yet,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.338
but the severing is
antemortem, which means

10:38.371 --> 10:40.874
it was disassociated
while he was still alive.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.877
So, they kill him near a body
of water that flows to the Gulf.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.246
The-the leg gets dumped there,
left behind,

10:46.279 --> 10:49.717
and the body is wrapped,
moved and buried?

10:49.750 --> 10:51.351
We have significant contusions

10:51.384 --> 10:53.020
on the knuckles
of both hands.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.421
So, a fight?

10:54.454 --> 10:57.024
Well, it's defense wounds.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.292
And although the
outcome was grievous,

10:59.326 --> 11:02.062
Calvin got some
good licks in.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.463
The basic theory.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.665
Sebastian did
the simulation.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.039
The killer came upon Calvin,
there was an altercation.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.241
The killer had
a large, sharp object.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.976
Think axe.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.846
There was the attack
that severed the limb, and...

11:18.879 --> 11:20.948
Calvin bled out.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.988
Dwayne...
Just keep talking,
Loretta. Please.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.457
Okay.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.360
We found this caught up
in the clothing.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.195
It's a second bicuspid,

11:35.228 --> 11:38.398
probably on the right side.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.834
It's definitely not Calvin's,

11:40.868 --> 11:42.936
'cause he's still
sporting a full set.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.472
So, whoever killed him
is missing a tooth.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.140
Pull DNA?

11:47.174 --> 11:49.977
Still running it through
the local criminal database.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.280
There's something else
I think you should see.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.816
That's Delta Crew, right?

11:55.849 --> 11:57.284
Cal grew up in the Lower Ninth.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.519
Got pulled into the gangs
by the time he was 12.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.290
Well, based on that irritation,
that tat's new.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.259
Fresh ink?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.161
Very.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.497
LASALLE:
I saw it when I was in vice.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.532
Gangs get their former members
to recommit.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.267
Then they kill 'em.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.369
It's an effective way
to show the kids

12:16.403 --> 12:18.071
that getting out
is not an option.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.106
It's called "dead hazing."

12:19.139 --> 12:20.540
It's called "sadistic."

12:20.573 --> 12:22.475
What if the Delta Crew
didn't do it themselves?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.111
Well, it'd be the 1-1-3s.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.980
Delta Crew and 1-1-3
have been at war for years.

12:27.014 --> 12:30.117
That's New Orleans's answer
to the Bloods and Crips.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.551
I'm sorry. The
Bloods and Crips?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.253
Who

12:35.856 --> 12:38.425
Delta Crew and 1-1-3 territories
are right next to each other.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.194
South Galvez Street's
the border.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.231
Which gang do you know best?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.499
Delta Crew.
All right.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.569
Take them. I'll introduce Brody
to the charms of the 1-1-3s.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.404
Let's go.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.540
BRODY:
All right, potential
new apartments.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.876
2725 Prytania?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.410
That's Uptown.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.980
How do you feel
about $600 strollers

13:00.013 --> 13:01.448
and organic everything?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.051
Okay, 3115 Royal.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.019
The Bywater.

13:06.053 --> 13:09.890
Neck beards, thick-rimmed
glasses, fixed-gear bikes.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.259
It's a big choice here, Brody.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.427
Where you live
says everything.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.163
Lasalle lives
in the French Quarter

13:16.196 --> 13:18.565
'cause he loves being
in the middle of it all.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.901
My wife and I--
we're in the Lower Garden,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.302
'cause it's walking distance

13:22.335 --> 13:24.604
from some of the best chefs
in America.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.306
Speak.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.475
Just looks like your
wife's in the Lower Garden.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.411
You're in the office.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.546
All I'm saying--

13:33.580 --> 13:36.183
where you lay your head
in this city defines you.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.885
Okay, so where do I go

13:37.918 --> 13:40.820
if I want to be defined
by a full night's sleep?

13:44.624 --> 13:47.294
Well, it's quiet.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.930
Calvin

13:49.963 --> 13:53.066
I ain't seen that joker
since he went to go play GI Joe.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.868
Well, GI Joe
is the Army.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.636
All the same to me.
So, you can't

13:56.669 --> 13:59.339
explain how we found him
with a fresh Delta Crew tat?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.174
Nah.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.077
You got any theories
on who did Calvin?

14:04.111 --> 14:06.179
Slow down, my man.
I'm just saying.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.981
A dead Delta--
current or former--

14:08.015 --> 14:10.083
only means one thing, right?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.484
1-1-3s.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.990
Think it's time for you to go.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.062
Think I'll sit here and finish
my cold drink, thank you.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.198
Leave when I get ready.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.936
Hey, Naomi.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.676
Give me a diet orange.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.280
That's what I'm
here for, baby.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.484
(indistinct chatter,
barking, sirens)

14:44.517 --> 14:46.920
Man, I ain't never heard
of no Calvin.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.056
Didn't ask you
if you heard of him.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.191
Asked why he's dead.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.261
You got some pretty,
pretty eyes.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.296
I've also got
a black belt in Aikido.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.933
You know, this wouldn't
be the first time

14:59.967 --> 15:02.002
Delta Crew done killed one
of their own, right?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.005
How are your teeth there, Swag?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.539
My teeth?
Yeah.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.277
Open up. Give me an "ah."

15:10.310 --> 15:12.079
Ah...

15:12.112 --> 15:13.680
All original.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.282
No cavities.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.084
I even floss twice a day.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.186
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

15:20.320 --> 15:21.688
Cover!

15:21.721 --> 15:23.156
Get down!
Everybody get down!

15:23.190 --> 15:25.592
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

15:26.726 --> 15:28.695
Get down.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.314
MAN :
We're reporting
from the West Bank

15:47.347 --> 15:48.982
where violence erupted
on the streets

15:49.016 --> 15:51.318
of New Orleans last night,
the latest chapter

15:51.351 --> 15:53.186
in an ongoing war

15:53.220 --> 15:56.156
between two of the area's
most notorious gangs...

15:56.189 --> 16:00.160
Delta Crew blame 1-1-3, and
1-1-3 put it on Delta Crew.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.995
Feels like a setup.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.730
Just can't tell
from which side.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.465
Ah, morning, Dwayne.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.268
Councilman.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.071
Got to remember
to lock the door.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.405
Might need a...
Warm-up.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.740
I was thinking the same.

16:13.773 --> 16:18.011
Mm. So, how's the family,
Dwayne?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.412
Linda well?

16:19.446 --> 16:21.014
What can I do for you, Hamilton?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.016
What, you need to ask?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.418
I mean, there's a gang war
going on out there,

16:25.452 --> 16:27.554
and I hear that
your people are the ones

16:27.587 --> 16:29.089
who've been stirring up the pot.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.624
We're conducting
an investigation.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.027
Well, I'm organizing an
emergency anti-gang task force.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.229
FBI, NOPD,
everybody's on board.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.730
And I was... well, I was hoping

16:37.764 --> 16:41.034
that NCIS might, uh...
want to join up, too.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.702
We'll help any way we can.
Well, good.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.304
Give me some names.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.306
Let my people
start rounding up suspects.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.807
Look, you...

16:47.840 --> 16:51.178
you know how I feel
about this community.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.713
No one has less love for
the gangs, but we haven't

16:53.746 --> 16:56.649
determined that they had a
hand in Calvin Parks' murder.

16:56.683 --> 17:00.453
Well, how long is it gonna be
before you determine something?

17:00.487 --> 17:02.689
'Cause people want
their streets cleaned up,

17:02.722 --> 17:05.725
and sometimes,
all that matters is appearances.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.796
Silly me, I thought
what mattered was justice.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.764
:
Okay.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.334
You have a blessed day.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.309
Don't ever go into
politics, Christopher.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.278
All of a sudden, your definition
of good and evil becomes defined

17:25.312 --> 17:27.714
by how many votes it gets you.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.416
I trust your instincts, but...

17:29.449 --> 17:31.418
"We hadn't determined
the gangs are involved yet"?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.753
Something doesn't
make sense.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.788
If the 1-1-3s did it,
they'd be expecting

17:35.822 --> 17:37.690
the Delta Crew to retaliate,
and they weren't.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.226
If the Delta Crew did it...

17:39.259 --> 17:41.594
then why the drive

17:43.130 --> 17:47.100
And I... I just
can't believe

17:47.134 --> 17:49.636
Calvin went back
into that world.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.505
You can't, or you
don't want to?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.544
How about a little of both?

18:05.685 --> 18:07.387
Which one's he in?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.389
Top right.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.558
Want me to open it up for you?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.526
You think
he'll reanimate

18:13.560 --> 18:15.562
and explain what the
hell he was up to?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.297
No.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.266
Then what's the point?

18:19.299 --> 18:22.235
How'd you meet Calvin?
Through Papa?

18:22.269 --> 18:25.338
No. No, I...

18:27.207 --> 18:30.177
I met Calvin when he was trying
to rob my house.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.245
Linda and I came home.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.648
Side window was broken,
there's this skinny kid

18:35.682 --> 18:37.717
in the parlor making off
with my camera.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.652
I grabbed his punk ass,

18:39.686 --> 18:41.921
threw him against the wall,
and in the time it took

18:41.954 --> 18:44.424
to turn him...

18:44.457 --> 18:47.494
over to someone...

18:50.863 --> 18:53.766
I saw something in him.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.769
And, you know,
it just...

18:56.803 --> 18:59.939
it kills me to think that
he went back into that world.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.576
Getting out is hard, isn't it?

19:03.610 --> 19:06.446
But he was trying to change.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.882
We're attached to what we know.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.619
Yeah.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.255
I appreciate your counsel,
Loretta.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.190
And I yours, Dwayne.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.328
I'll leave you alone with him.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.940
You wanted to see me?

19:33.973 --> 19:35.642
Yeah, tech got
around the password.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.811
There's not much here,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.248
but basic social media sites
fill his browser history.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.283
E-mails sent to a girl
in Shreveport.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.785
Nothing that really leads to
or away from gang involvement.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.420
Oh, so nothing helpful.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.955
Well, not nothing.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.523
He sent an e-mail to himself

19:50.557 --> 19:52.892
from his NMCI account
to his personal account.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.395
No subject. But inside,
there's a bunch of numbers.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.696
Look. Big numbers.

19:56.729 --> 20:00.667
8749 and 9449.
Some smaller.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.702
22.3 and 12.6.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.272
The big numbers
keep repeating.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.407
So, he was working the wharfs.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.008
These aren't times.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.743
Not ship numbers
or coordinates.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.912
3493.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.847
I know that number.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.783
What in the Sam Hill
does that mean?

20:16.816 --> 20:19.252
You know how
I do crosswords.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.321
In your head?
I see something,
and it sticks.

20:21.354 --> 20:25.525
3493. I am telling you,
that is a number I've seen.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.395
You present yourself
all buttoned up,

20:28.428 --> 20:31.598
but you are an
odd bird, Brody.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.703
Thank you for coming, dear.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.738
I love that you
can do that.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.707
Just, eyes in the
back of your head.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.042
Or your reflection
in the back of my camera.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.644
Thunderstorm?

20:44.677 --> 20:47.347
Probably what?

20:47.380 --> 20:50.650
Mature stage multicell cluster.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.919
It's just rain. I like rain.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.655
Who doesn't?

20:55.688 --> 20:56.823
Well, cats don't.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.025
And snakes don't.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.027
And my sister Antonia, actually,

21:01.060 --> 21:02.829
she was a bit ombrophobic,
which I never really...

21:02.862 --> 21:06.699
Sebastian, what could make
a tattoo disappear?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.835
I've taken these photos,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.303
one every three hours.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.971
See how in each shot

21:12.004 --> 21:14.541
the tattoo seems
to be getting lighter.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.944
Typical putrefaction just
doesn't account for this.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.714
Mind if I take a sample?
Mm-hmm.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.451
I think I remember a similar
case out of Washington,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.686
where they used the tattoo
to determine

21:26.719 --> 21:29.456
time of death.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.862
And Dr. Mallard was the coroner.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.030
Lovely excuse to catch up.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.338
Pride here.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.975
Yeah, I'm on my way.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.522
Walter called.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.926
Said you weren't gonna play.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.629
First time in 15 years, huh?

22:09.662 --> 22:14.066
I took it apart to clean it
like I always do,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.902
but when it came time to
put it back together,

22:15.935 --> 22:20.607
I just... couldn't.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.610
I'm like that.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.778
In pieces.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.582
You find whoever killed Calvin?

22:29.616 --> 22:32.151
Not yet. But I will.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.687
I know that.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.559
And I also know

22:39.592 --> 22:43.563
that you will feel better,

22:43.596 --> 22:45.565
just a little,

22:45.598 --> 22:47.033
if you play.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.969
I just keep thinking...

22:50.002 --> 22:52.972
if he went back
with them gangs...

22:53.005 --> 22:54.507
that's my fault.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.576
If I'd just
done something

22:56.609 --> 22:58.578
or didn't do something

22:58.611 --> 23:02.081
or-or could've done something...

23:02.114 --> 23:04.884
I can't play, Dwayne.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.887
Doesn't feel like I ever will.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.723
Not without knowing
what happened.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.926
Go grab your coat and hat.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.596
We'll take a walk. We'll...

23:16.629 --> 23:18.698
we'll talk.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.702
Huh?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.572
I got nothing to say,
old friend.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.732
YOUNG WOMAN:
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, baby.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.768
Hey, uh, I'm in class.
Is everything all right?

23:55.802 --> 23:58.738
It is.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.774
Now that I've heard your voice.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.045
Sorry. Another late night.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.047
Dogs barking.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.216
Why don't you let me
help you find a place?

24:11.684 --> 24:15.054
I appreciate
the offer. I do.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.224
Nothing personal. I just, um...

24:18.257 --> 24:22.495
I prefer that my work and
personal lives be kept separate.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.798
That's not the way it works
around here.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.634
We're all one big family.

24:27.667 --> 24:30.036
Sooner you accept that,
the easier it's gonna be.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.539
In the meantime,
my blood sugar's getting low.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.240
Let's order dessert.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.776
Mmm, okay.
Let's see. Where's
this menu at here?

24:36.809 --> 24:37.944
Here we go.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.080
Oh, I recommend
the bread pudding.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.849
Key lime pie.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.584
Can't go wrong.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.853
Pineapple?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.121
Pineapple?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.123
I don't think they have any.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.725
3493.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.561
Pineapple.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.898
Government uses National Stock
Numbers which contain subgroups

24:58.931 --> 25:01.634
that identify Federal Supply
Groups, Federal Supply Classes,

25:01.668 --> 25:03.970
NATO country codes and National
Item Identification Numbers,

25:04.003 --> 25:05.572
or NIINs.

25:05.605 --> 25:06.973
Slow down.
3493
is the NIIN

25:07.006 --> 25:08.975
for pineapple, which I know

25:09.008 --> 25:11.778
because my ex-fiancé
had a weird fruit salad fetish.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.913
You have an ex

25:13.946 --> 25:17.850
So, Calvin worked
the wharfs, right?

25:17.884 --> 25:21.754
3493 is a number he wrote
however many times.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.556
Pallets of pineapples.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.224
And if the big numbers
were products,

25:25.257 --> 25:26.993
then the smaller numbers
must have been...

25:27.026 --> 25:29.596
Were weights. All right,
let's get back to the numbers

25:29.629 --> 25:31.063
and figure out
what the other shipments were.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.900
Okay, fine, but can we still
have some bread pudding?

25:33.933 --> 25:36.268
Absolutely.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.772
DUCKY:
Do you remember the last time

25:39.806 --> 25:41.974
I was in New Orleans, Loretta?

25:42.008 --> 25:44.777
December the 25th, 2004.
Right.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.847
Which happened to be the only
snowfall day in New Orleans

25:47.880 --> 25:50.016
since 1989.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.951
Well, if you were
the cause of the snow,

25:51.984 --> 25:53.119
you're not welcome back.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.121
Good to see you, Agent Pride.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.624
I think the good doctor and I
just figured out

25:57.657 --> 25:59.992
why Calvin's tattoo
was coming off.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.293
Yes, I had a case

26:01.327 --> 26:02.695
nearly four years ago

26:02.729 --> 26:04.631
where the tattoo was applied

26:04.664 --> 26:07.734
only hours prior
to the victim's death.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.302
The result: The micropunctures
didn't have time to heal

26:10.336 --> 26:12.138
because the blood
couldn't congeal.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.173
We think that's what's going on
with Calvin.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.042
All right. So...

26:16.075 --> 26:18.878
We tried to use Ducky's case
as a baseline to approximate

26:18.911 --> 26:21.180
when Calvin received the tattoo,

26:21.213 --> 26:23.750
and the difference was
approximately three hours.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.719
He got the tattoo three hours
before he died?

26:26.753 --> 26:27.920
No.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.155
In this case,

26:29.188 --> 26:32.191
the tattoo was applied
after death.

26:32.224 --> 26:36.228
The ink won't hold because
there's no blood flow at all.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.001
So Calvin wasn't back
with the Delta Crew.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.036
Killer put the tat on.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.672
Posthumously.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.108
To make this look like part
of a gang killing.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.848
That's good work.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.863
BRODY:
That'd be a four.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.399
LASALLE:
Okay, so subtract that
and give me the new number.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.901
Hey!

27:14.934 --> 27:17.870
Oh, he's up.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.272
You two been up all night?
BRODY:
It's not like I get

27:20.306 --> 27:22.008
any sleep at my place anyway.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.176
We made a point of trying
to keep it down for you.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.145
BRODY:
You snore.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.279
Loud.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.380
No, I don't.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.086
Can you take a look at this?

27:35.822 --> 27:37.323
So, working off
the theory

27:37.356 --> 27:39.458
that the gang angle
isn't real, we are convinced

27:39.491 --> 27:42.061
that the murder had to do with
Calvin working at the wharf.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.930
Those big numbers
in Calvin's computer,

27:43.963 --> 27:46.733
they're all NIIN for different
items loaded at the port.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.768
3493, pineapple.

27:48.801 --> 27:52.338
8748, bananas. 9449, coffee.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.707
All coming in on the same boat,
which originated

27:54.741 --> 27:57.243
in Guatemala.
So, in Guatemala,

27:57.276 --> 27:59.111
the pallets are weighed, right?

27:59.145 --> 28:00.980
Then the boat sails
to New Orleans,

28:01.013 --> 28:03.115
where all the cargo
is transferred to Navy ships.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.117
But before
it's put aboard,

28:05.151 --> 28:08.320
it's weighed again.
The smaller numbers
in Calvin's e-mails,

28:08.354 --> 28:10.757
those are the difference
between the Guatemala

28:10.790 --> 28:12.792
and New Orleans
weights.
The pallets ended up

28:12.825 --> 28:16.095
being lighter by the time
the Navy got a hold of them?

28:17.329 --> 28:18.831
Smuggling.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.132
Based on the weight
differentials,

28:20.166 --> 28:21.968
we're thinking, uh,
guns or drugs.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.970
So the question is,

28:24.003 --> 28:27.173
was Calvin murdered
because he found out about it

28:27.206 --> 28:29.475
or because he was in on it?

28:29.508 --> 28:30.810
In on it?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.745
BRODY: Password
on his computer,

28:32.779 --> 28:34.113
e-mails in code.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.954
Lasalle here.
Turn that up.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.956
Sebastian, what do you got?

28:43.990 --> 28:46.092
I'm standing outside the offices
of Councilman Hamilton

28:46.125 --> 28:48.127
of District C here
in New Orleans.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.962
He'll be hosting
a press conference today

28:49.996 --> 28:52.832
to talk about a recent rash
of gang violence

28:52.865 --> 28:54.400
that's hit the city.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.969
All in all, Councilman Hamilton

28:57.003 --> 28:59.471
is positioning himself
as a law-and-order candidate

28:59.505 --> 29:01.473
ahead of this year's
mayoral election.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.109
Okay, turn it off.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.811
LASALLE:
Sebastian wants

29:04.844 --> 29:06.012
to show us something.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.246
It's about the tattoo ink.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.848
All right, do it.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.418
I'll deal with him.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.422
I'd appreciate if you'd stop
using my murder investigation

29:16.455 --> 29:19.291
as an excuse to grandstand.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.894
All right, he-here's
what I don't get, okay?

29:21.928 --> 29:25.564
All right, you are beloved from
Bourbon Street to the swamps

29:25.597 --> 29:28.267
'cause you go out of your
way to be of assistance

29:28.300 --> 29:29.836
to this whole
city, including...

29:29.869 --> 29:31.838
all of my counterparts
on the council.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.106
And yet you and I
still can't get along.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.276
Well, maybe they're just nicer
than you.

29:37.309 --> 29:40.146
You want a task force to roll up
crime? I'm all for it.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.181
Let's right now get out there
and go arrest people.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.983
I only have two conditions:

29:44.016 --> 29:46.886
We arrest them for things
they've actually done,

29:46.919 --> 29:48.888
and we leave the
cameras behind.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.857
Uh, what do you care,
Pride?

29:50.890 --> 29:53.292
It was just a gangbanger who
got chopped up by another one.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.294
He had a name.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.296
Calvin Parks.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.165
You call him a gangbanger again,

29:59.198 --> 30:02.368
and our getting along problem
is gonna get a whole lot worse.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.337
SEBASTIAN:
Did you know the FDA

30:05.371 --> 30:06.572
doesn't regulate tattoo ink?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.440
It's a weird quirk.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.476
They regulate makeup that's
applied on top of the skin,

30:10.509 --> 30:12.945
but since the ink goes under
the skin, it's not covered.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.613
Meaning?
Manufacturers aren't

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448
required to report
what heavy metals

30:16.482 --> 30:18.150
they use for pigment bases.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.619
And... there's no
standard mix for ink.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.890
Some inks contain cadmium,
others use iron and copper.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.926
So the end product that they
produce, it's kind of like...

30:26.959 --> 30:28.460
Is like a fingerprint.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.062
More like DNA,

30:30.096 --> 30:32.098
but you're cooking with gas,
Agent Brody.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.201
Anyway, I narrowed down the
list of suppliers to seven.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.436
Then I tested their inks
against Calvin's tissue sample,

30:37.469 --> 30:38.905
and there is only one

30:38.938 --> 30:40.973
that uses
that exact barium-

30:41.007 --> 30:43.242
titanium blend.
It is on Magazine.

30:43.275 --> 30:46.913
And I will gladly share this
with you under one condition.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.581
There's a condition?

30:49.615 --> 30:52.284
Take me with you.
I got to get out of the lab

30:52.318 --> 30:54.853
and just see something
that's alive.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.128
Got to wonder what future
civilizations are gonna think

31:02.161 --> 31:04.496
about our dabbling
in the ancient arts of ink.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.966
They'll say drinking and tatting
don't mix.

31:06.999 --> 31:10.002
That's how I ended up
with Big Al on my derriere.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.573
Roll Tide.
SEBASTIAN: You know,
I thought about getting

31:14.606 --> 31:18.244
the noble gas column from
the periodic table, right...

31:18.277 --> 31:20.913
That or something
from Lord of the Rings.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.115
Hmm.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.416
Brody?

31:24.450 --> 31:27.353
It's private.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.056
The subject matter?
Or the location?

31:30.089 --> 31:33.459
Don't intimate about my
intimacies, please. Thank you.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.564
I'm thinking...
a broken heart.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.234
Sexy girl on a mud flap, and...

31:42.268 --> 31:44.103
something to do with
Lord of the Rings.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.009
NCIS.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.144
Recognize this?

31:52.178 --> 31:54.546
You're insulting me.
That's not my work.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.148
What about this guy?

31:56.182 --> 31:58.284
When you last saw him,
he was dead.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.153
Whoa, wait, I don't know
anything about a dead sailor.

32:01.187 --> 32:04.023
BRODY:
You sure about that?
Yeah.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.025
Hey, what's this?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.160
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, sorry about that.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.262
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, don't
worry about it.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.231
Sebastian,
do your thing.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.966
Got a question
for you.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.401
Had any dental work lately?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.269
What?
Root canal?

32:17.303 --> 32:18.704
Cavities?
Bridge work?

32:18.737 --> 32:20.672
BRODY:
Extractions?

32:20.706 --> 32:24.176
Barium and titanium.
It's his ink.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.645
Your skill set is gonna
come in handy trading tats

32:26.678 --> 32:28.447
for prison hooch in Angola.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.051
All right, look. A guy offered
me $500 for a needle and a vial.

32:32.084 --> 32:35.321
What guy?
Cash doesn't come with a name.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.256
Come on, look at me.
Look at my teeth.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.092
Look at my tongue,
look whatever you need.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.265
We'll need you to provide
a description of the man

32:46.298 --> 32:47.666
to our sketch artist.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.769
Sketch artist? Please.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.239
I went to the
Rhode Island School of Design.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.408
PRIDE:
Ha. Rhode Island School
of Design. Artists.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.410
Bruce has definitely
seen worse.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.246
He can get an I.D. with
one eye and a pimple.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.313
Ain't that right, Bruce?

33:01.347 --> 33:04.216
So, you've nicknamed the
facial recognition system?

33:04.250 --> 33:05.684
You bet.
Is that a problem?

33:05.717 --> 33:08.287
:
You're weird.
I-I was told

33:08.320 --> 33:11.557
that there's some body art
I should ask you about.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.659
This is why I prefer
to keep my work

33:13.692 --> 33:15.161
and personal lives separate.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.131
Yes. Harold Werner.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.532
Chucklehead
from the wharfs?

33:20.566 --> 33:22.168
I thought he scampered
off in a hurry.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.403
Get an address.

33:33.579 --> 33:36.148
PRIDE: Harold Werner.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.684
NCIS. Open up.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.733
Clear.
Clear.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.378
Clear.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.347
Clear.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.228
We found him.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.514
Walk me through this.
We know Harold was in on it,

34:42.548 --> 34:44.316
'cause he's the one
who bought the ink.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.485
And we know he didn't
kill himself.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.754
Stuffed in a closet
pretty much confirms that.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.622
What's he got going
on in his mouth?

34:50.656 --> 34:52.658
Full set. 32 and counting.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.327
So, Harold gets done
in his own trailer.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.629
Not likely he was
snuck up on in there.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.631
The toothless
accomplice.

34:59.665 --> 35:01.900
Where we gonna
find him?

35:01.933 --> 35:04.770
Same place Calvin did.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.776
Harold? I suppose that
does make some sense.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.245
'Cause for years he's been
short on money. Last few months

35:13.279 --> 35:15.147
he started
living it up.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.649
We're wondering if you could
give us a list of people

35:17.683 --> 35:20.819
he was working closely with,
who might have also had access

35:20.852 --> 35:22.654
to shipments intended
for the Navy.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.656
Of course.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.425
Anything to help.
It's all in the office.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.361
Can I say something?

35:29.395 --> 35:31.930
Awfully quick to accept
Harold as a smuggler?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.565
And if I'd lost a tooth...

35:33.599 --> 35:36.568
I'd use ice
to dull the pain.

35:36.602 --> 35:40.206
I'd say he starts
running in three,

35:40.239 --> 35:42.208
two, one.

35:42.241 --> 35:43.275
ALL:
I got this.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.478
BRODY:
NCIS! Stop!

35:49.548 --> 35:52.218
Hands, hands!

35:52.251 --> 35:53.719
Let me see your hands!

35:58.524 --> 36:00.859
Come here.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.895
Now, will you look at that?
Look at that.

36:03.929 --> 36:07.299
Son, you need a dentist
like I need to move back home.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.706
Stop resisting.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.545
So, inside the office
we found a key

36:19.578 --> 36:21.713
and the key led us
to the wharf shack.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.249
The mother lode.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.983
Heroin.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.220
It's being sent
to the lab to confirm,

36:28.254 --> 36:30.389
but it'd answer
what was being smuggled.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.757
Murder weapon?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.459
Again,

36:33.492 --> 36:35.461
off to the lab.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.363
And we're off to interrogation.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.669
Warm today.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.671
Air-conditioning
feels good, doesn't it?

36:45.704 --> 36:47.339
All I need now is a beignet

36:47.373 --> 36:48.874
and some lemonade,
and I'd be in heaven.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.211
Aspirin help
your toothache?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.715
My apologies
if I made it worse.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.586
So, Petty Officer
Calvin Parks

37:00.619 --> 37:02.688
discovered you were
smuggling heroin.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.556
You had him killed him to
make sure he didn't report

37:04.590 --> 37:06.858
what he knew
up his chain of command.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.561
Gang tattoo was...

37:09.595 --> 37:11.597
a clever way to throw us off.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.834
What's bothering me

37:15.867 --> 37:18.737
is your employment file.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.642
Says you've only been in
New Orleans for two years.

37:23.675 --> 37:27.012
You didn't know he had a past
with the gangs, did you?

37:27.045 --> 37:28.747
No.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.982
So, who told
you to put

37:31.016 --> 37:33.552
the tattoo on Calvin's arm?

37:35.354 --> 37:37.556
Truth will set you free.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.468
What the hell is she doing?

37:49.501 --> 37:51.870
Giving you a new tattoo.
Letting the inmates

37:51.903 --> 37:54.340
in the pen know you're
the target they're looking for.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.342
You put that tat on Calvin,

37:56.375 --> 37:57.476
caused that little
shooting spree.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.810
Like to think the Delta Crew

37:58.844 --> 38:00.779
and the 1-1-3s would like
a little piece of you.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.016
If I say what I know, gangs
are the least of my worries.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.457
Call me when he's processed.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.824
You're going to prison
for murdering

38:12.858 --> 38:15.894
a United States Navy sailor.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.896
Enjoy the party, my friend.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.703
Afternoon, Hamilton.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.838
Oh, afternoon,
Dwayne. Say, uh,

38:26.872 --> 38:29.908
I hear congratulations are in
order. You got your man. Good.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.878
Here's what I'm chewing on:

38:32.911 --> 38:35.547
Who's got the port
in his district?

38:35.581 --> 38:36.982
Who'd get a taste from

38:37.015 --> 38:40.085
getting customs to look the
other way on a smuggling ring?

38:40.118 --> 38:41.653
Who'd incite a gang war

38:41.687 --> 38:43.889
to justify a task force?

38:43.922 --> 38:45.757
And who would have known enough

38:45.791 --> 38:48.126
about Calvin's
youthful indiscretions

38:48.159 --> 38:50.429
to have suggested a tattoo?

38:51.930 --> 38:54.099
That's quite a theory, Dwayne.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.034
You got any proof
to back that up?

38:56.067 --> 38:57.903
Not yet.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.372
But you know I will.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.408
See you around my city.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.743
Your city?

39:04.776 --> 39:08.013
Don't you ever forget it.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.048
(whistling "When the Saints
Go Marching In")

39:13.552 --> 39:14.786
(music playing,
indistinct conversations)

39:14.820 --> 39:16.655
BRODY:
First round is on me.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.724
What are we celebrating?

39:18.757 --> 39:20.759
Someone has a
new apartment.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.795
Adorable little guest house
owned by a friend of Lasalle's.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.664
It's got a garden,

39:25.697 --> 39:27.165
rent's pretty cheap, and, uh,

39:27.198 --> 39:28.767
it's on the Mardi Gras route.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.470
Which defines you as...

39:31.503 --> 39:32.938
Thrilled to be here.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.675
Movers. Excuse me. Hello?

39:36.708 --> 39:40.579
Guest house with a garden
on the Mardi Gras route?

39:40.612 --> 39:43.482
When are you gonna tell Brody
who Lasalle's friend is?

39:43.515 --> 39:45.517
When I have to raise the rent.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.522
You know, my last two tenants
were a pain in my ass, so

39:50.556 --> 39:53.158
it'll be nice
to rent it to family.
Yeah.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.763
Excuse me a moment.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.998
Sure thing, Dwayne.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.005
Thank you, Dwayne.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.040
Think nothing of it.

40:09.074 --> 40:13.044
Would've killed me knowing he'd
wanted back in with them gangs.

40:13.078 --> 40:16.782
Oh, he wanted to
join a gang. Mine.

40:16.815 --> 40:21.487
Calvin was working a
case. And he was good.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.889
Took a lot of thinking to
figure out what was going on.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.958
And if he was mine--

40:26.992 --> 40:29.961
in many ways, he was--

40:29.995 --> 40:32.531
I'd be awfully proud.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.001
You, uh...

40:36.034 --> 40:37.969
want to sit in
on the first song?

40:38.003 --> 40:39.938
Be my honor.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.541
All right.
"Go to the Mardi Gras."

40:42.574 --> 40:44.576
B-flat.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.212
*
Go, Pride!

40:47.245 --> 40:49.147
LASALLE:
King can play, can't he?

40:49.180 --> 40:51.717
I can't believe him.
