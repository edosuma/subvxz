15:12.010 --> 15:13.180
waiting to happen. -(phone rings)

15:15.100 --> 15:16.210
-Si?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.080
(speaking Spanish)

15:21.160 --> 15:23.170
I have your friends in custody.

15:23.180 --> 15:25.210
They are on their way here.

15:27.050 --> 15:30.010
-Well, I think it's time that you called Señora Garcia.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.120
-Vic: Whoo! -(Lily laughing)

15:36.130 --> 15:38.200
-(laughing)

15:39.200 --> 15:42.200
-Vic: Ah! I love it when you get your way!

15:42.210 --> 15:44.040
You get all the supplies, Fanta?

15:44.050 --> 15:45.100
-Yeah, they are in the van.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.200
-Time to roll our sleeves up, boys.

15:51.210 --> 15:54.080
-("El Terron" by The Bongo Hop playing)

16:08.000 --> 16:11.220
-The serpent has arrived at the mayor's house.

16:15.030 --> 16:16.100
-Señora Garcia.

16:47.170 --> 16:50.140
It's time to put these dogs down.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.030
The pleasure will be mine.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.230
-(gunshots)

16:56.080 --> 16:57.130

-(gunshot)

17:07.110 --> 17:10.000
-A game well played, Albert.

17:10.010 --> 17:12.150
But with one fatal flaw.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.000
-And what would that be?

17:14.010 --> 17:16.020
-Don't miscalculate the other guy's greed.

17:17.180 --> 17:20.080
Those guns I gave you have been de-commissioned.

17:20.090 --> 17:21.100
-(gun clicks)

17:23.010 --> 17:25.160
-You really think for a minute I would share this town with anybody?

17:25.170 --> 17:27.160
I told you before.

17:27.170 --> 17:30.080
San Toledo's my pueblo.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.190
-(distant gunfire)

17:31.200 --> 17:33.100
-Albert: I'll tell you one thing I've learned

17:33.110 --> 17:35.150
during my short time in your...

17:35.160 --> 17:36.210
pueblo,

17:36.220 --> 17:39.160
always take out a bigger insurance policy than the other guy.

17:39.170 --> 17:41.110
-Well, this looks cozy.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.150
-Not too late, are we, Al?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.170
-Actually, you're bang on time, Charlie boy.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.060
-(gunshot)

17:48.030 --> 17:49.030
-(Ortega sighs)

17:49.040 --> 17:50.200
-(gun cocks)

17:54.170 --> 17:56.000
-I kill you for fun,

17:56.010 --> 17:58.090
but for a fist full of diamonds...

17:59.100 --> 18:00.190
-(Ortega groaning)

18:04.090 --> 18:07.000
-I am an elected government official!

18:07.010 --> 18:09.100
You can't kill the mayor, Albert.

18:09.110 --> 18:10.170
-I'm not gonna kill the mayor.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.050
-No! General Volkov will.

18:13.060 --> 18:16.090
-Back to the yard with him. We crush him in a Skoda.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.130
-(Ortega grunting)

18:22.210 --> 18:24.220
-Well!

18:24.230 --> 18:26.180
I think these belong to us.

18:30.030 --> 18:31.130
-(engine revving)

18:44.220 --> 18:46.080
you son of a bitch.

19:12.170 --> 19:14.150

19:14.160 --> 19:16.170
I don't have a good feeling about this.

19:16.180 --> 19:19.110
-Don't worry, Lil. Albert's got it.

19:21.020 --> 19:22.170
Ah, speak of the bank robber's son

19:22.180 --> 19:24.020
and he shall appear.

19:27.230 --> 19:29.160
-Everybody inside!

19:29.170 --> 19:30.230
-Vic: Chop, chop!

19:32.130 --> 19:33.130
-Come on!

19:38.210 --> 19:40.110
-(metal squeaking)

19:43.150 --> 19:45.190
-He's the fuzz. Been watching the bar.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.030
Made sure he saw us.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.140
-Dunno, could be a lot more cops here at this rate if all goes to track.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.220
-It's rather poetic, isn't it?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.150
It all ending here, at the Bunker Bar.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.070
-Yeah. One way or another, Charlie.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.200

20:13.120 --> 20:15.160
-Come out with your hands up immediately!

20:15.170 --> 20:17.140
Or we will bring you out with force!

20:17.150 --> 20:19.090
-I don't like this, Albert.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.040
It's a hell of a risk.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.230
-Yeah, well, no risk, no reward, eh?

20:26.140 --> 20:28.010
Hate 'Em?

20:39.130 --> 20:41.100
Mayor Ortega?

20:41.110 --> 20:43.000

20:43.010 --> 20:44.110
Still got something you want.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.040
-(screaming) You want to try to kill me?

21:20.070 --> 21:21.230
You might have done it too

21:22.000 --> 21:24.090
if it hadn't been for that  puta  girlfriend of yours!

21:24.100 --> 21:27.120
I really thought you were something special, Albert.

21:27.130 --> 21:28.210
Now look at you.

21:28.220 --> 21:33.060
Your life and the life of your family is soon to end

21:33.070 --> 21:36.210
all because you were too naive to think you could trust her.

21:36.220 --> 21:40.010
-Well, I guess I'm not a very good judge of character.

21:41.010 --> 21:43.070
-This is a cold business.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.150
Your blood runs too warm.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.010
Ines knows that better than you.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.190
Where is she now?

21:49.200 --> 21:52.110
Not by your side, by the look of things.

21:54.010 --> 21:56.120
-Yeah, well, you taught her that lesson a long time ago, didn't ya?

21:56.130 --> 21:57.180
You know, when she was just a kid.

22:00.140 --> 22:02.200
-So you two really were close.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.210
(laughing)

22:06.190 --> 22:09.160
This gets more tragic by the minute.

22:10.170 --> 22:13.030
You let yourself care about her,

22:13.040 --> 22:15.200
about those degenerate friends of yours

22:15.210 --> 22:17.060
and your pathetic father.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.230
You let your attachments blind you.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.200
You would have liked Ines's father,

22:21.210 --> 22:24.040
he was soft like you!

22:24.050 --> 22:26.100
When he heard rumors of another cop

22:26.110 --> 22:28.000
shaking down drug dealers

22:28.010 --> 22:29.170
and moving the product himself,

22:29.180 --> 22:32.190
well, he just had to catch the guy!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.130
-And that other cop was you.

22:36.140 --> 22:39.220
-We all had to start somewhere!

22:39.230 --> 22:42.140
I killed Jorge Santiago

22:42.150 --> 22:46.120
because it was a means to an end.

22:46.130 --> 22:49.080
The same reason I killed those men after him,

22:49.090 --> 22:51.040
whose names I barely remember.

22:51.050 --> 22:53.070
Same reason I will kill you.

22:55.130 --> 22:58.020
Now, you go back in there

22:58.030 --> 23:00.000
and bring me back the diamonds,

23:00.010 --> 23:01.080
and your associates,

23:01.090 --> 23:03.060
with their hands in the air!

23:03.070 --> 23:06.110
You have two minutes.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.090
Not a second more.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.200
-He's coming in two minutes.

23:21.210 --> 23:24.050
-Okay! Everybody in position.

23:26.140 --> 23:29.000
-Don't think you're leaving me out of all the fun.

23:29.010 --> 23:30.030
-Wouldn't dream of it.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.090
-Everything okay with your Romanian friends?

23:34.100 --> 23:36.150
-Oh, yeah. We had a riot.

-Not a second too soon, Ladrani.

30:26.010 --> 30:29.080
-Beni Ladrani always honors his end of the deal.

30:30.090 --> 30:32.220
Now it's your time to do the same.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.200
-First things first, eh?

30:34.210 --> 30:36.070
Hate 'Em!

30:36.080 --> 30:38.050
-Get up! -(Ortega moaning)

30:41.030 --> 30:43.050
-Albert: Yeah, Mayor Ortega, you were right.

30:43.060 --> 30:47.140
There really are so many mistakes on the board just waiting to happen.

30:47.150 --> 30:49.100
-Charlie: You got so caught up in your business,

30:49.110 --> 30:52.050
you forgot the most important rule.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.100
-It's always personal.

30:55.190 --> 30:59.220
-Now San Toledo is our pueblo.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.090
-Checkmate, pal.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.110
-I will disappear.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.050
You will never hear or see from me again.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.180
-We can easily arrange this.

31:17.190 --> 31:20.010
You're coming back to Morocco with me.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.170
I will take my time with you.

31:28.150 --> 31:29.200
-(phone chiming)

31:32.140 --> 31:33.230
-Ramirez (on phone):  Turn on your TV.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.220
It's on the news, Charlie.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.220
-Uh, one second, guys. Billy, turn on the TV.

31:37.230 --> 31:39.020
-(TV remote clicks)

31:39.030 --> 31:40.030
-(speaking Spanish)

31:55.050 --> 31:57.190
-I killed Jorge Santiago,

31:57.200 --> 31:59.130
because it was   a means to an end.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.140
The same--  -(TV clicks off)

32:00.150 --> 32:03.110
-Listen to me, it's over now.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
Okay?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.010
-Muta.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.080
-(Ines sniffles)

32:13.130 --> 32:15.200
-I think this belongs to you, Beni.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.040
-Ah, minus the 10 million delivery fee, of course.

32:20.050 --> 32:21.050
-Well, you know,

32:21.060 --> 32:23.200
depending on current market value, Lotti.

32:23.210 --> 32:26.130
-Yes, Charlie, depending on market value.

32:26.140 --> 32:28.210
-Small price to pay for clean house.

32:28.220 --> 32:30.070
-(Vic clears throat)

32:32.170 --> 32:35.080
-Do you plan on staying or...?

32:35.090 --> 32:37.180
-We've got no plans to leave.

32:37.190 --> 32:40.000
I'm afraid I can't make any decisions

32:40.010 --> 32:41.200
without talking to my people first.

32:41.210 --> 32:46.160
-Hmm, I can respect that, but we'll talk, huh?

32:46.170 --> 32:48.230
-Uh, Vic, where did you moor the yacht?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.220
Mr. Ladrani needs to get back over the drink.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.150
-She's parked out the front, Charlie boy.

32:55.010 --> 32:56.080
It's hard to see 40 million

32:56.090 --> 32:58.070
just stroll out through the door.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.230
-Well, just look on the bright side, darling.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.120
We have exactly what we came here with, 10 million.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.220
-Vic: That's very true, my love.

33:04.230 --> 33:07.160
From now on my glass will be half full.

33:11.150 --> 33:13.120
-Man.

33:13.130 --> 33:15.180
I'm sorry about the bar, Lotti.

33:17.090 --> 33:18.200
I know how hard you worked on it.

33:18.210 --> 33:20.130
-Oh, that's okay.

33:20.140 --> 33:23.200
Just wait till you see what I'm gonna do with the place now.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.120
-Go on, girl.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.100
-(both chuckle)

33:28.110 --> 33:30.220
-I could eat a fucking horse. What we cooking, son?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.040
-Arroz caldonso,  family style, Hate 'Em.

33:34.050 --> 33:36.130
-Si , Fanta, family style.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.110
-(waves crashing)

33:57.050 --> 33:59.080
-So now it's all over, what are you gonna do?

34:02.020 --> 34:04.100
-Honestly...

34:04.110 --> 34:06.140
I never saw being a cop as anything more

34:06.150 --> 34:09.040
than a way to get justice for my father.

34:09.050 --> 34:11.060
Now that the truth is out...

34:12.150 --> 34:14.070
I don't know what I'll do.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.150
But I know that I can't stay in San Toledo.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.120
-Yeah, but Ines, this entire plan

34:27.130 --> 34:29.150
was about exposing Mayor Ortega.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.230
-(Ines laughs softly)

34:31.000 --> 34:33.050
-And reclaiming San Toledo for the good guys.

34:34.130 --> 34:35.220
And we've done that.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.120
-And now you're just gonna leave?

34:48.050 --> 34:49.190
-(Ines chuckles)

34:58.050 --> 34:59.200
-Thank you, Albert.

35:14.140 --> 35:15.210
-Nah.

35:18.220 --> 35:20.140

38:00.210 --> 38:02.130
He's looking for a job.

38:02.140 --> 38:03.210
-A job?

38:06.090 --> 38:08.080
Well, that's easy.

38:08.090 --> 38:10.120
I need someone to manage this place for me.
