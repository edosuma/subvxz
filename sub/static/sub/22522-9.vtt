02:48.631 --> 02:52.465
If you wish to make
an apple pie from scratch...

02:53.036 --> 02:57.132
...you must first invent the universe.

02:57.340 --> 02:58.932
Thank you very much.

03:00.109 --> 03:02.543
Suppose I cut a piece...

03:03.413 --> 03:05.347
...out of this apple pie.

03:18.027 --> 03:20.495
Crumbly, but good.

03:23.833 --> 03:28.770
And now suppose we cut
this piece in half, or more or less.

03:30.373 --> 03:33.240
And then cut this piece in half...

03:33.843 --> 03:36.004
...and keep going.

03:36.212 --> 03:40.876
How many cuts before we get
down to an individual atom?

03:41.084 --> 03:45.783
The answer is about
90 successive cuts.

03:46.890 --> 03:50.223
Of course, this knife isn't
sharp enough...

03:50.426 --> 03:52.894
...the pie is too crumbly...

03:53.096 --> 03:56.497
...and an atom is too small
to see in any case.

03:56.699 --> 04:00.135
But there is a way to do it.

04:02.772 --> 04:07.004
It was here at
Cambridge University in England...

04:07.210 --> 04:10.509
...that the nature of the atom was
first understood...

04:10.713 --> 04:15.082
...in part by shooting pieces
of atoms at atoms...

04:15.285 --> 04:18.448
...and seeing how they bounce off.

04:18.655 --> 04:22.182
A typical atom is surrounded...

04:22.392 --> 04:26.158
...by a kind of cloud of electrons.

04:26.362 --> 04:30.298
The electrons are electrically
charged, as the name suggests...

04:30.500 --> 04:33.867
...and they determine the chemical
properties of the atom.

04:34.070 --> 04:38.131
For example, the glitter of gold...

04:41.110 --> 04:43.044
...or the transparency of the solid...

04:43.246 --> 04:46.272
...that's made from the atoms
silicon and oxygen.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.780
But deep inside the atom...

04:49.986 --> 04:54.047
...hidden far beneath
the outer electron cloud...

04:54.257 --> 04:58.284
...is the nucleus, composed chiefly
of protons and neutrons.

04:58.494 --> 05:00.860
Atoms are very small.

05:01.064 --> 05:05.626
100 million of them, end to end,
would be about so big.

05:05.835 --> 05:10.738
And the nucleus is 100,000 times
smaller still.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.971
Nevertheless, most of the mass
in an atom is in the nucleus.

05:15.178 --> 05:18.238
The electrons are by comparison...

05:18.448 --> 05:21.417
...just bits of moving fluff.

05:21.618 --> 05:24.781
Atoms are mainly empty space.

05:24.988 --> 05:29.049
Matter is composed chiefly
of nothing.

05:31.961 --> 05:35.089
When we consider cutting this
apple pie, but...

05:35.298 --> 05:38.734
...down beyond a single atom...

05:39.002 --> 05:43.837
...we confront an infinity
of the very small.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.009
And when we look up
at the night sky...

05:47.210 --> 05:51.203
...we confront an infinity
of the very large.

05:51.414 --> 05:56.113
These infinities are among the most
awesome of human ideas.

05:56.319 --> 06:00.756
They represent an unending regress
which goes on...

06:01.157 --> 06:05.287
...not just very far, but forever.

06:05.495 --> 06:09.363
Have you ever stood between two
parallel mirrors...

06:09.565 --> 06:10.964
...in a barbershop, say...

06:11.167 --> 06:14.659
...and seen a very large
number of you?

06:14.871 --> 06:17.806
Or you could use...

06:19.042 --> 06:21.510
...two flat mirrors...

06:21.944 --> 06:24.344
...and a candle flame...

06:24.547 --> 06:27.846
...you would see a large number
of images...

06:28.051 --> 06:31.851
...each the reflection
of another image.

06:33.756 --> 06:36.987
You can't really see an infinity
of images...

06:37.193 --> 06:40.526
...because the mirrors aren't
perfectly flat and aligned.

06:40.730 --> 06:44.131
And there's a candle or
a candle flame in the way...

06:44.333 --> 06:47.063
...and light doesn't travel
infinitely fast.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.704
When we talk of real infinities...

06:49.906 --> 06:53.774
...we're talking about a quantity
larger than any number.

06:53.976 --> 06:58.436
No matter what number you have in
mind, infinity is larger.

07:02.151 --> 07:06.451
There's a nice way
to write large numbers.

07:06.656 --> 07:08.055
You can...

07:09.125 --> 07:11.559
...write the number 1000...

07:11.761 --> 07:14.355
...as 10 to the power three...

07:14.564 --> 07:18.500
...meaning, a one
followed by three zeros.

07:18.701 --> 07:23.638
Or a million is written as
10 to the power six...

07:23.973 --> 07:28.740
...meaning, a one
followed by six zeros.

07:29.479 --> 07:33.609
There's no largest number. If anybody
gives you a candidate...

07:33.816 --> 07:35.807
...you can always add the
number one to it.

07:36.018 --> 07:38.953
But there certainly are
very big numbers.

07:39.155 --> 07:43.854
The American mathematician Edward
Kasner once asked his nephew...

07:44.060 --> 07:47.461
...to invent a name for
an extremely large number:

07:48.164 --> 07:51.258
10 to the power 100...

07:51.467 --> 07:56.404
...which I can't write out all the
zeros because there isn't room.

07:56.606 --> 08:01.373
The boy called it a googol.

08:03.079 --> 08:07.880
If you think a googol is large,
consider a googolplex.

08:08.584 --> 08:11.144
It's 10 to the power of a googol.

08:11.354 --> 08:14.812
That is, a one followed, not by
100 zeros...

08:15.024 --> 08:18.187
...but by a googol zeros.

08:19.262 --> 08:21.025
Now, by comparison...

08:21.230 --> 08:23.892
...with these enormous numbers...

08:24.100 --> 08:27.297
...the total number of atoms
in that apple pie...

08:27.503 --> 08:30.472
...is only about 10 to the 26th.

08:30.673 --> 08:33.540
Tiny compared to a googol and...

08:33.743 --> 08:37.304
...of course, much, much less
than a googolplex.

08:37.513 --> 08:39.105
The number
of elementary particles...

08:39.315 --> 08:41.283
...protons, neutrons and electrons...

08:41.484 --> 08:43.179
...in the accessible universe...

08:43.386 --> 08:45.684
...is of the order of 10 to the 80th.

08:45.888 --> 08:47.913
A one followed by 80 zeros.

08:48.124 --> 08:50.183
Still much, much less than a googol...

08:50.393 --> 08:53.988
...and vastly less than a googolplex.

08:54.197 --> 08:58.964
And yet, these numbers, the googol
and the googolplex...

08:59.168 --> 09:03.901
...do not approach, they come
nowhere near infinity.

09:04.106 --> 09:08.941
In fact, a googolplex is precisely
as far from infinity...

09:09.145 --> 09:12.012
...as is the number one.

09:12.215 --> 09:15.446
We started to write out
a googolplex...

09:15.651 --> 09:17.448
...but it wasn't easy.

09:19.288 --> 09:21.916
SAGAN:
<i>It's a very big number.</i>

09:41.277 --> 09:45.577
<i>Writing out a googolplex is a
<i>spectacularly futile exercise.</i></i>

09:46.182 --> 09:50.209
<i>A piece of paper large enough to</i>
<i>contain the zeros in a googolplex...</i>

09:50.419 --> 09:54.617
<i>... couldn't be stuffed into</i>
<i>the known universe.</i>

10:00.329 --> 10:01.296
Fortunately...

10:02.832 --> 10:04.299
...there's a...

10:05.601 --> 10:07.933
...much simpler
and more concise way...

10:08.137 --> 10:10.230
...to write a googolplex.

10:18.481 --> 10:19.880
Like this.

10:20.082 --> 10:22.073
And infinity...

10:25.254 --> 10:27.688
...can be represented like this.

10:28.257 --> 10:32.159
This is the Cavendish Laboratory
at Cambridge University...

10:32.361 --> 10:36.320
...where the constituents of the atom
were first discovered.

10:36.532 --> 10:40.491
The realm of the very small.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.798
<i>From the time of Democritus,</i>
<i>in the fifth century B. C...</i>

10:46.008 --> 10:49.739
<i>... people have speculated</i>
<i>about the existence of atoms.</i>

10:49.946 --> 10:53.313
<i>For the last few hundred years,</i>
<i>there have been persuasive...</i>

10:53.516 --> 10:57.077
<i>... but indirect arguments that all</i>
<i>matter is made of atoms.</i>

10:57.320 --> 11:01.916
<i>But only in our time, have we actually</i>
<i>been able to see them.</i>

11:02.124 --> 11:06.720
<i>Here the red blobs are the random</i>
<i>throbbing motions...</i>

11:07.196 --> 11:08.686
<i>... of uranium atoms...</i>

11:08.898 --> 11:11.890
<i>... magnified 100 million times.</i>

11:13.169 --> 11:17.697
<i>How Democritus of Abdera</i>
<i>would've enjoyed this movie.</i>

11:22.712 --> 11:27.479
We pretty much take atoms for granted.

11:28.284 --> 11:31.276
And yet, there are so
many different kinds...

11:31.487 --> 11:35.890
...lovely and useful at
the same time.

11:36.092 --> 11:37.218
Look.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.547
<i>There are some 92 chemically</i>
<i>distinct kinds of atoms...</i>

12:09.025 --> 12:10.856
<i>... naturally found on Earth.</i>

12:11.060 --> 12:14.826
<i>They're called the chemical elements.</i>

12:30.379 --> 12:32.904
<i>Virtually everything</i>
<i>we see and know...</i>

12:33.115 --> 12:35.515
<i>... all the beauty</i>
<i>of the natural world...</i>

12:35.718 --> 12:39.210
<i>... is made of these</i>
<i>few kinds of atoms...</i>

12:39.422 --> 12:43.791
<i>... arranged in harmonious</i>
<i>chemical patterns.</i>

13:00.209 --> 13:03.906
Here we've represented
all 92 of them.

13:04.113 --> 13:08.447
At room temperature, many of
them are solids.

13:08.651 --> 13:10.346
A few are gases.

13:10.686 --> 13:12.017
And two of them...

13:13.322 --> 13:16.348
...bromine and mercury,
are liquids.

13:18.027 --> 13:21.793
They're arranged in order
of complexity.

13:21.997 --> 13:25.831
Hydrogen, the simplest element,
is element number 1.

13:26.035 --> 13:29.198
And uranium, the most complex...

13:29.638 --> 13:32.038
...is element 92.

13:35.377 --> 13:38.210
Some elements are very familiar.

13:38.881 --> 13:40.109
For example...

13:40.316 --> 13:44.412
...silicon, oxygen, magnesium,
aluminum, iron...

13:44.620 --> 13:46.144
...those that make up the Earth.

13:46.422 --> 13:50.916
Or hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur...

13:51.127 --> 13:53.618
...the elements that are
essential for life.

13:53.829 --> 13:57.788
Other elements are
spectacularly unfamiliar.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.969
For example, hafnium.

14:01.570 --> 14:02.969
Erbium.

14:03.172 --> 14:05.072
Dysprosium.

14:05.674 --> 14:07.972
Praseodymium.

14:08.177 --> 14:11.078
Elements we don't bump
into in everyday life.

14:11.881 --> 14:16.818
By and large, the more familiar an
element is, the more abundant it is.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.451
There's a great deal of iron
on the Earth.

14:19.655 --> 14:23.250
Not all that much yttrium.

14:23.459 --> 14:24.687
The fact...

14:24.894 --> 14:28.489
...that atoms are composed of only
three kinds of elementary particles...

14:28.697 --> 14:31.165
...protons, neutrons and electrons...

14:31.367 --> 14:33.767
...is a comparatively recent finding.

14:33.969 --> 14:36.437
The neutron was not discovered
until 1932.

14:36.639 --> 14:41.099
And it, like the electron and
the proton, were discovered here...

14:41.310 --> 14:43.278
...at Cambridge University.

14:43.479 --> 14:47.575
Modern physics and chemistry
have reduced the complexity...

14:47.783 --> 14:52.345
...of the sensible world
to an astonishing simplicity.

14:52.555 --> 14:56.787
Three units, put together
in different patterns...

14:56.992 --> 15:00.928
...make, essentially, everything.

15:06.368 --> 15:09.860
A neutron is electrically neutral...

15:10.072 --> 15:12.563
...as its name suggests.

15:13.142 --> 15:16.976
A proton has a positive
electrical charge...

15:17.546 --> 15:21.812
...and an electron an equal,
negative electrical charge.

15:22.017 --> 15:24.542
Since every atom is
electrically neutral...

15:24.753 --> 15:26.983
...the number of protons
in the nucleus...

15:27.256 --> 15:31.317
...must equal the number of electrons
far away in the electron cloud.

15:31.527 --> 15:35.588
The protons and neutrons, together,
make up the nucleus of the atom.

15:36.665 --> 15:41.602
Now, the chemistry of an atom,
the nature of a chemical element...

15:41.804 --> 15:44.034
...depends only on the number
of electrons...

15:44.240 --> 15:47.835
...which equals the number of protons,
which is called the atomic number.

15:48.043 --> 15:50.341
Chemistry is just numbers.

15:50.546 --> 15:53.640
An idea which would have
appealed to Pythagoras.

15:53.849 --> 15:55.248
If you're an atom...

15:55.451 --> 15:58.648
...and you have just one proton...

15:58.854 --> 16:00.321
...you're hydrogen.

16:00.522 --> 16:02.717
Two protons, helium.

16:02.925 --> 16:04.756
Three, lithium.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.724
Four, beryllium.
Five protons, boron.

16:07.930 --> 16:12.492
Six, carbon, and seven, nitrogen.
Eight, oxygen, and so on.

16:12.701 --> 16:15.431
All the way to 92 protons...

16:15.638 --> 16:18.630
...in which case your name is uranium.

16:19.241 --> 16:22.369
Protons have positive
electrical charges...

16:22.578 --> 16:25.775
...but like charges repel each other.

16:25.981 --> 16:28.381
So why does the nucleus hold together?

16:28.584 --> 16:31.815
Why don't the electrical
repulsion of the protons...

16:32.021 --> 16:33.955
...make the nucleus fly to pieces?

16:34.556 --> 16:37.081
Because there's another
force in nature.

16:37.293 --> 16:39.853
Not electricity, not gravity...

16:40.062 --> 16:41.495
...the nuclear force.

16:41.697 --> 16:44.598
We can think of it as short-range...

16:44.800 --> 16:47.200
...hooks which start working...

16:47.403 --> 16:50.930
...when protons or neutrons
are brought very close together.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.631
The nuclear force can overcome...

16:54.376 --> 16:56.936
...the electrical repulsion of the
protons.

16:57.146 --> 17:00.206
Since the neutrons exert
nuclear forces...

17:00.716 --> 17:02.377
...but not electrical forces...

17:02.584 --> 17:07.078
...they are a kind of glue which holds
the atomic nucleus together.

17:08.624 --> 17:13.152
A lump of two protons
and two neutrons...

17:13.362 --> 17:15.262
...is the nucleus of a helium atom...

17:15.464 --> 17:17.932
...and is very stable.

17:18.133 --> 17:22.627
Three helium nuclei, stuck together by
nuclear forces...

17:22.838 --> 17:24.669
...makes carbon.

17:24.873 --> 17:28.274
Four helium nuclei makes oxygen.

17:28.477 --> 17:31.344
There's no difference between
four helium nuclei...

17:31.580 --> 17:34.140
...stuck together by nuclear forces
and the oxygen nucleus.

17:34.350 --> 17:35.840
They're the same thing.

17:36.218 --> 17:39.517
Five helium nuclei makes neon.

17:39.722 --> 17:42.122
Six makes magnesium.

17:42.324 --> 17:45.987
Seven makes silicon.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.755
Eight makes sulfur, and so on.

17:48.964 --> 17:51.364
Increasing the atomic
numbers by two...

17:51.567 --> 17:54.434
...and always making
some familiar element.

17:54.636 --> 17:55.568
Every time...

17:56.538 --> 17:58.563
...we add or subtract one proton...

17:58.774 --> 18:01.470
...and enough neutrons
to keep the nucleus together...

18:01.677 --> 18:04.145
...we make a new chemical element.

18:04.346 --> 18:07.110
Consider mercury:

18:07.316 --> 18:11.082
If we subtract one proton
from mercury...

18:11.286 --> 18:15.484
...and three neutrons,
we convert it into gold.

18:15.691 --> 18:19.787
The dream of the ancient alchemists.

18:20.796 --> 18:24.664
Beyond element 92, beyond uranium...

18:24.867 --> 18:27.335
...there are other elements.

18:27.536 --> 18:29.697
They don't occur naturally
on the Earth.

18:29.905 --> 18:32.339
They're synthesized by
human beings and...

18:32.541 --> 18:35.169
...fall to pieces pretty rapidly.

18:35.377 --> 18:39.006
One of them, element 94,
is called plutonium...

18:39.214 --> 18:42.945
...and is one of the most
toxic substances known.

18:43.152 --> 18:47.589
Where do the naturally occurring
chemical elements come from?

18:47.790 --> 18:52.227
Perhaps a separate creation
for each element?

18:52.428 --> 18:55.295
But all the elements are made of the
same elementary particles.

18:55.497 --> 18:58.489
The universe, all of it,
everywhere...

18:58.700 --> 19:02.101
...is 99.9% hydrogen and helium.

19:02.337 --> 19:04.202
The two simplest elements.

19:04.406 --> 19:05.600
In fact, helium...

19:06.041 --> 19:09.943
...was detected on the sun before it
was ever found on the Earth.

19:10.145 --> 19:13.945
Might the other chemical elements
have somehow...

19:14.149 --> 19:18.108
...evolved from hydrogen
and helium?

19:18.320 --> 19:20.686
To avoid the electrical repulsion...

19:21.390 --> 19:25.850
...protons and neutrons must be brought
very close together so the hooks...

19:26.061 --> 19:27.824
...which represent nuclear forces...

19:28.030 --> 19:29.395
...are engaged.

19:29.598 --> 19:32.726
This happens only at very high
temperatures, where particles...

19:32.935 --> 19:37.599
...move so fast that there's no
time for electrical repulsion to act.

19:37.873 --> 19:42.810
Temperatures of tens of
millions of degrees.

19:43.078 --> 19:46.479
Such high temperatures are
common in nature.

19:46.682 --> 19:47.979
Where?

19:48.183 --> 19:51.118
In the insides of the stars.

20:06.535 --> 20:10.301
<i>Atoms are made in the</i>
<i>insides of stars.</i>

20:10.506 --> 20:14.943
<i>In most of the stars we see, hydrogen</i>
<i>nuclei are being jammed together...</i>

20:15.143 --> 20:16.701
<i>... to form helium nuclei.</i>

20:17.112 --> 20:21.640
<i>Every time a nucleus of helium is made,</i>
<i>a photon of light is generated.</i>

20:22.618 --> 20:26.076
<i>This is why the stars shine.</i>

20:33.595 --> 20:37.588
<i>Stars are born in great</i>
<i>clouds of gas and dust.</i>

20:37.799 --> 20:41.530
<i>Like the Orion Nebula,</i>
<i>1500 light-years away...</i>

20:41.737 --> 20:45.730
<i>... parts of which</i>
<i>are collapsing under gravity.</i>

20:53.382 --> 20:57.785
<i>Collisions among the atoms heat</i>
<i>the cloud until, in its interior...</i>

20:57.986 --> 21:00.648
<i>... hydrogen begins to fuse</i>
<i>into helium...</i>

21:00.856 --> 21:03.654
<i>... and the stars turn on.</i>

21:09.765 --> 21:12.461
<i>Stars are born in batches.</i>

21:12.668 --> 21:15.068
<i>Later, they wander out</i>
<i>of their nursery...</i>

21:15.270 --> 21:17.898
<i>... to pursue their destiny</i>
<i>in the Milky Way.</i>

21:18.106 --> 21:20.939
<i>Adolescent stars, like the Pleiades...</i>

21:21.143 --> 21:23.907
<i>... are still surrounded</i>
<i>by gas and dust.</i>

21:24.112 --> 21:28.572
<i>Eventually, they journey</i>
<i>far from home.</i>

21:32.387 --> 21:37.324
<i>Somewhere there are stars formed from</i>
<i>the same cloud complex as the sun...</i>

21:37.693 --> 21:39.854
<i>... 5 billion years ago.</i>

21:40.062 --> 21:42.622
<i>But we do not know which</i>
<i>stars they are.</i>

21:42.831 --> 21:44.731
<i>The siblings of the sun...</i>

21:45.067 --> 21:49.800
<i>... may, for all we know, be on the</i>
<i>other side of the galaxy.</i>

21:51.406 --> 21:56.343
<i>Perhaps they also warm nearby</i>
<i>planets as the sun does.</i>

21:58.947 --> 22:01.848
<i>Perhaps they too have presided...</i>

22:02.050 --> 22:05.952
<i>... over the evolution</i>
<i>of life and intelligence.</i>

22:27.509 --> 22:32.242
<i>The sun is the nearest star,</i>
<i>a glowing sphere of gas...</i>

22:32.748 --> 22:36.775
<i>... shining because of its heat,</i>
<i>like a red-hot poker.</i>

22:41.123 --> 22:46.060
<i>The surface we see in ordinary visible</i>
<i>light is at 6000 degrees centigrade.</i>

22:46.294 --> 22:48.091
<i>But in its hidden interior...</i>

22:48.830 --> 22:52.288
<i>... in the nuclear furnace where</i>
<i>sunlight is ultimately generated...</i>

22:52.501 --> 22:56.096
<i>... its temperature is</i>
<i>20 million degrees.</i>

23:04.479 --> 23:05.468
<i>In x-rays...</i>

23:05.681 --> 23:09.412
<i>... we see a part of the sun</i>
<i>that is ordinarily invisible...</i>

23:09.618 --> 23:12.246
<i>... its million-degree halo of gas...</i>

23:12.454 --> 23:14.547
<i>... the solar corona.</i>

23:14.990 --> 23:18.084
<i>In ordinary visible light, these</i>
<i>cooler, darker regions...</i>

23:18.293 --> 23:20.193
<i>... are the sunspots.</i>

23:22.931 --> 23:27.391
<i>They are associated with</i>
<i>great surges of flaming gas...</i>

23:27.602 --> 23:31.971
<i>... tongues of fire which would engulf</i>
<i>the Earth if it were this close.</i>

23:32.307 --> 23:36.073
<i>These prominences are guided</i>
<i>into paths determined...</i>

23:36.278 --> 23:38.508
<i>... by the sun's magnetic field.</i>

23:51.159 --> 23:53.389
<i>The dark regions of the x-ray sun...</i>

23:53.595 --> 23:56.291
<i>... are holes in the solar corona...</i>

23:56.498 --> 24:00.491
<i>... through which stream the protons</i>
<i>and electrons of the solar wind...</i>

24:00.702 --> 24:04.900
<i>... on their way past the planets</i>
<i>to interstellar space.</i>

24:07.409 --> 24:12.108
<i>All this churning power is driven</i>
<i>by the sun's interior...</i>

24:12.314 --> 24:16.216
<i>... which is converting 400 million</i>
<i>tons of hydrogen into helium...</i>

24:16.418 --> 24:17.942
<i>... every second.</i>

24:18.153 --> 24:21.748
<i>The sun is a great fusion reactor...</i>

24:21.990 --> 24:24.458
<i>... into which a million Earths</i>
<i>would fit.</i>

24:24.659 --> 24:27.787
<i>Luckily for us, it's safely placed...</i>

24:27.996 --> 24:31.523
<i>... 150 million kilometers away.</i>

24:48.049 --> 24:51.951
It is the destiny of stars
to collapse.

24:53.054 --> 24:56.455
Of the thousands of stars you see
when you look up at the night sky...

24:56.658 --> 25:01.288
...every one of them is living in
an interval between two collapses.

25:01.496 --> 25:02.986
An initial collapse of...

25:03.198 --> 25:06.690
...a dark interstellar gas cloud
to form the star...

25:06.902 --> 25:09.370
...and a final collapse
of the luminous star...

25:09.571 --> 25:11.334
...on the way to its ultimate fate.

25:11.807 --> 25:16.744
Gravity makes stars contract unless
some other force intervenes.

25:17.145 --> 25:20.046
The sun is an immense ball
of radiating hydrogen.

25:20.248 --> 25:24.548
The hot gas in its interior tries
to make the sun expand.

25:24.753 --> 25:28.154
The gravity tries to make
the sun contract.

25:28.390 --> 25:31.621
The present state of the sun is
the balance of these two forces...

25:31.827 --> 25:36.389
...an equilibrium between
gravity and nuclear fire.

25:37.065 --> 25:39.727
In this long middle age
between collapses...

25:39.935 --> 25:42.631
...the stars steadily shine.

25:42.838 --> 25:46.672
But when the nuclear fuel is exhausted,
the interior cools...

25:46.875 --> 25:49.673
...the pressure no longer supports
its outer layers...

25:49.878 --> 25:52.039
...and the initial collapse resumes.

25:52.848 --> 25:55.146
There are three ways that stars die.

25:55.350 --> 25:57.784
Their fates are predestined.

25:57.986 --> 25:59.920
Everything depends on their
initial mass.

26:00.121 --> 26:02.715
A typical star with a mass
like the sun...

26:02.924 --> 26:05.518
...will one day
continue its collapse...

26:05.727 --> 26:08.628
...until its density becomes very high.

26:08.830 --> 26:10.559
And then the contraction is stopped...

26:10.765 --> 26:12.630
...by the mutual repulsion of...

26:12.834 --> 26:16.099
...the overcrowded electrons
in its interior.

26:16.304 --> 26:19.068
A collapsing star twice as
massive as the sun...

26:19.274 --> 26:21.799
...isn't stopped by the
electron pressure.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.376
It goes on falling in on itself...

26:24.579 --> 26:27.275
...until nuclear forces
come into play...

26:27.482 --> 26:30.576
...and they hold up the
weight of the star.

26:30.785 --> 26:33.948
But a collapsing star three times as
massive as the sun isn't...

26:34.155 --> 26:36.214
...stopped even by nuclear forces.

26:36.424 --> 26:41.361
There's no force known that can
withstand this enormous compression.

26:41.596 --> 26:44.656
And such a star has
an astonishing destiny.

26:44.866 --> 26:46.595
It continues to collapse...

26:46.868 --> 26:49.598
...until it vanishes utterly.

26:50.839 --> 26:55.299
Each star is described by the force
that holds it up against gravity.

26:55.510 --> 26:58.946
A star that's supported by
the gas pressure...

26:59.147 --> 27:02.844
...is a normal, run-of-the-mill star
like the sun.

27:03.051 --> 27:06.748
A collapsed star that's held up
by electron forces...

27:06.955 --> 27:08.582
...is called a white dwarf.

27:08.790 --> 27:12.624
It's a sun shrunk to
the size of the Earth.

27:12.827 --> 27:16.194
A collapsed star supported
by nuclear forces...

27:16.398 --> 27:18.263
...is called a neutron star.

27:18.466 --> 27:21.993
It's a sun shrunk to
the size of a city.

27:22.203 --> 27:25.138
And a star so massive that
in its final collapse...

27:25.340 --> 27:27.035
...it disappears altogether...

27:27.242 --> 27:28.903
...is called a black hole.

27:29.110 --> 27:32.102
It's a sun with no size at all.

27:32.781 --> 27:35.477
But on their ways to their
separate fates...

27:35.684 --> 27:40.348
...all stars experience
a premonition of death.

27:40.555 --> 27:43.023
Before the final
gravitational collapse...

27:43.224 --> 27:48.059
...the star shudders and
briefly swells into some...

27:48.530 --> 27:50.964
...grotesque parody of itself.

27:51.166 --> 27:55.535
With its last gasp,
it becomes a red giant.

27:59.274 --> 28:01.765
<i>Some 5 billion years from now...</i>

28:01.977 --> 28:06.380
<i>... there will be a last,</i>
<i>perfect day on Earth.</i>

28:09.384 --> 28:12.911
<i>Then, the sun will slowly change...</i>

28:13.121 --> 28:16.147
<i>... and the Earth will die.</i>

28:19.294 --> 28:22.195
<i>There is only so much</i>
<i>hydrogen fuel in the sun.</i>

28:22.397 --> 28:24.797
<i>When it's almost all</i>
<i>converted to helium...</i>

28:25.000 --> 28:28.663
<i>... the solar interior will continue</i>
<i>its original collapse.</i>

28:28.870 --> 28:33.330
<i>Higher temperatures in its core will</i>
<i>make the outside of the sun expand...</i>

28:33.575 --> 28:37.033
<i>... and the Earth will</i>
<i>become slowly warmer.</i>

28:37.278 --> 28:40.543
<i>Eventually, life will be</i>
<i>extinguished...</i>

28:40.915 --> 28:43.850
<i>... the oceans will evaporate</i>
<i>and boil...</i>

28:44.052 --> 28:48.079
<i>... and our atmosphere will</i>
<i>gush away to space.</i>

28:50.892 --> 28:54.692
<i>The sun will become a bloated</i>
<i>red giant star...</i>

28:54.896 --> 28:56.420
<i>... filling the sky...</i>

28:56.664 --> 29:00.828
<i>... enveloping and devouring</i>
<i>the planets Mercury and Venus.</i>

29:01.036 --> 29:04.096
<i>And probably the Earth as well.</i>

29:04.305 --> 29:09.242
<i>The inner solar system will</i>
<i>reside inside the sun.</i>

29:12.480 --> 29:15.347
<i>But perhaps by then, our</i>
<i>descendants...</i>

29:15.550 --> 29:18.110
<i>... will have ventured somewhere else.</i>

29:22.223 --> 29:26.626
<i>In its final agonies, the sun</i>
<i>will slowly pulsate.</i>

29:26.828 --> 29:29.729
<i>By then, its core will have</i>
<i>become so hot...</i>

29:29.931 --> 29:33.367
<i>... that it temporarily converts</i>
<i>helium into carbon.</i>

29:33.568 --> 29:37.470
<i>The ash from today's nuclear fusion</i>
<i>will become the fuel...</i>

29:37.772 --> 29:42.641
<i>... to power the sun near the end of</i>
<i>its life in its red giant stage.</i>

29:44.446 --> 29:47.279
<i>Then the sun will lose</i>
<i>great shells...</i>

29:47.816 --> 29:50.011
<i>... of its outer atmosphere to space...</i>

29:50.218 --> 29:53.619
<i>... filling the solar system</i>
<i>with eerily glowing gas.</i>

29:53.822 --> 29:56.882
<i>The ghost of a star, outward bound.</i>

29:57.092 --> 30:00.584
<i>Perhaps half the mass of the sun</i>
<i>will be lost in this way.</i>

30:02.530 --> 30:05.829
<i>Viewed from elsewhere, our system</i>
<i>will then resemble...</i>

30:06.034 --> 30:08.161
<i>... the Ring Nebula in Lyra...</i>

30:08.369 --> 30:12.999
<i>... the atmosphere of the sun</i>
<i>expanding outward like a soap bubble.</i>

30:13.875 --> 30:17.106
<i>And at the very center will be</i>
<i>a white dwarf.</i>

30:17.345 --> 30:19.813
<i>The hot exposed core of the sun...</i>

30:20.014 --> 30:23.575
<i>... its nuclear fuel now</i>
<i>exhausted, slowly cooling...</i>

30:23.818 --> 30:27.254
<i>... to become a cold, dead star.</i>

30:30.258 --> 30:32.886
<i>Such is the life of an ordinary star.</i>

30:33.094 --> 30:36.291
<i>Born in a gas cloud,</i>
<i>maturing as a yellow sun...</i>

30:36.498 --> 30:38.329
<i>... decaying as a red giant...</i>

30:38.533 --> 30:43.470
<i>... and dying as a white dwarf</i>
<i>enveloped in its shroud of gas.</i>

30:52.514 --> 30:55.608
<i>Suppose, as we traveled through</i>
<i>interstellar space...</i>

30:55.817 --> 30:57.648
<i>... in our ship of the imagination...</i>

30:57.852 --> 31:02.221
<i>... we could sample the cold,</i>
<i>thin gas between the stars.</i>

31:02.423 --> 31:05.415
<i>We would find a great</i>
<i>preponderance of hydrogen...</i>

31:05.627 --> 31:08.187
<i>... an element as old as the universe.</i>

31:08.396 --> 31:11.092
<i>We would find carbon,</i>
<i>oxygen, silicon.</i>

31:11.299 --> 31:14.393
<i>The most abundant atoms in the</i>
<i>cosmos, apart from hydrogen...</i>

31:14.602 --> 31:18.038
<i>... are those most easily made</i>
<i>in the stars.</i>

31:18.239 --> 31:21.640
<i>But we would also find</i>
<i>a small proportion of rare elements.</i>

31:21.843 --> 31:24.641
<i>Praseodymium, say, or gold.</i>

31:24.846 --> 31:27.007
<i>They're not made in red giants.</i>

31:27.215 --> 31:31.845
<i>Such elements are manufactured in</i>
<i>one of the most dramatic gestures...</i>

31:32.086 --> 31:34.577
<i>... of which a star is capable.</i>

31:35.723 --> 31:38.988
<i>A star more than about one and</i>
<i>a half times the mass of the sun...</i>

31:39.394 --> 31:41.021
<i>... cannot become a white dwarf.</i>

31:41.229 --> 31:44.198
<i>It will end its life by</i>
<i>blowing itself up...</i>

31:44.399 --> 31:48.859
<i>... in a titanic stellar explosion</i>
<i>called a supernova.</i>

31:50.405 --> 31:54.068
<i>There has been no supernova explosion</i>
<i>in our province of the galaxy...</i>

31:54.442 --> 31:56.171
<i>... since the telescope's invention...</i>

31:56.377 --> 31:59.278
<i>... and our sun will not</i>
<i>become a supernova.</i>

31:59.480 --> 32:01.107
<i>But in our imagination...</i>

32:01.649 --> 32:04.948
<i>... we can fulfill the dream of many</i>
<i>earthbound astronomers...</i>

32:05.386 --> 32:10.119
<i>... and safely witness, close-up,</i>
<i>a supernova explosion.</i>

32:14.495 --> 32:18.397
<i>Most of stellar evolution takes</i>
<i>millions or billions of years.</i>

32:18.633 --> 32:22.160
<i>But the interior collapse that</i>
<i>triggers a supernova explosion...</i>

32:22.403 --> 32:23.836
<i>... takes only seconds.</i>

32:24.205 --> 32:28.198
<i>The star becomes brighter than</i>
<i>all the other stars in the galaxy...</i>

32:28.409 --> 32:29.808
<i>... put together.</i>

33:05.513 --> 33:07.777
<i>If a nearby star became</i>
<i>a supernova...</i>

33:07.982 --> 33:12.715
<i>... it would be calamity enough for</i>
<i>the inhabitants of this alien system.</i>

33:12.920 --> 33:15.320
<i>But if their own sun went supernova...</i>

33:15.523 --> 33:18.856
<i>... it would be</i>
<i>an unprecedented catastrophe.</i>

33:19.060 --> 33:21.494
<i>Worlds would be charred and vaporized.</i>

33:21.696 --> 33:26.156
<i>Life, even on the outer planets,</i>
<i>would be extinguished.</i>

33:26.367 --> 33:30.565
<i>In our ship of the imagination, we</i>
<i>are now backing away from the star.</i>

33:30.772 --> 33:32.433
<i>But the explosion fragments...</i>

33:32.640 --> 33:36.132
<i>... traveling almost at the speed</i>
<i>of light, are overtaking us.</i>

33:36.344 --> 33:40.940
<i>Individual atomic nuclei, accelerated</i>
<i>to high speeds in the explosion...</i>

33:41.149 --> 33:43.083
<i>... become cosmic rays.</i>

33:43.284 --> 33:47.550
<i>This is another way that stars return</i>
<i>the atoms they've synthesized...</i>

33:47.755 --> 33:49.620
<i>... back into space.</i>

33:50.391 --> 33:52.450
<i>The shock wave</i>
<i>of expanding gases...</i>

33:52.660 --> 33:55.185
<i>... heats and compresses</i>
<i>the interstellar gas...</i>

33:55.396 --> 33:58.388
<i>... triggering a later generation</i>
<i>of stars to form.</i>

33:58.599 --> 33:59.930
<i>In this sense also...</i>

34:00.134 --> 34:04.537
<i>... stars are phoenixes</i>
<i>rising from their own ashes.</i>

34:09.377 --> 34:13.211
<i>The cosmos was originally</i>
<i>all hydrogen and helium.</i>

34:13.448 --> 34:16.815
<i>Heavier elements were made</i>
<i>in red giants and in supernovas...</i>

34:17.018 --> 34:19.009
<i>... and then blown off to space...</i>

34:19.220 --> 34:21.950
<i>... where they were available</i>
<i>for subsequent generations...</i>

34:22.156 --> 34:23.783
<i>... of stars and planets.</i>

34:23.991 --> 34:27.757
<i>Our sun is probably a
<i>third-generation star.</i></i>

34:27.962 --> 34:29.589
<i>Except for hydrogen and helium...</i>

34:29.797 --> 34:34.734
<i>... every atom in the sun and the Earth</i>
<i>was synthesized in other stars.</i>

34:35.002 --> 34:39.530
<i>The silicon in the rocks, the oxygen</i>
<i>in the air, the carbon in our DNA...</i>

34:39.741 --> 34:43.507
<i>... the gold in our banks, the</i>
<i>uranium in our arsenals...</i>

34:43.711 --> 34:47.306
<i>... were all made thousands</i>
<i>of light-years away...</i>

34:47.515 --> 34:49.380
<i>... and billions of years ago.</i>

34:49.584 --> 34:53.918
<i>Our planet, our society</i>
<i>and we ourselves...</i>

34:54.122 --> 34:57.387
<i>... are built of star stuff.</i>

35:02.397 --> 35:05.366
We're in a lava tube.

35:06.134 --> 35:10.468
A cave carved through the Earth...

35:10.671 --> 35:13.231
...by a river of molten rock.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.301
To do a little experiment...

35:17.311 --> 35:20.712
...we've brought a Geiger counter...

35:23.751 --> 35:27.346
...and a piece of uranium ore.

35:28.089 --> 35:33.026
The Geiger counter is sensitive to
high-energy charged particles...

35:33.394 --> 35:37.057
...protons, helium nuclei, gamma rays.

35:37.331 --> 35:40.732
If we bring it close
to the uranium ore...

35:40.935 --> 35:45.497
...the count rate, the number of
clicks, increases dramatically.

35:48.176 --> 35:50.474
We also have a lead canister here.

35:51.045 --> 35:53.605
And if I drop the uranium ore...

35:54.148 --> 35:58.847
...into the canister, which absorbs
the radiation, and cover it up...

36:01.222 --> 36:04.419
...I then find the count-rate
goes down substantially...

36:04.625 --> 36:06.320
...but it doesn't go down to zero.

36:07.528 --> 36:10.622
What's the source of the
remaining counts?

36:11.732 --> 36:16.192
Some of them come from radioactivity
in the walls of the cave.

36:16.404 --> 36:18.599
But there's more to it than that.

36:18.806 --> 36:22.242
Some of the counts are due to
high-energy charged particles...

36:22.443 --> 36:26.504
...which are penetrating the
roof of the cave.

36:26.714 --> 36:29.842
We are listening to cosmic rays.

36:31.018 --> 36:35.478
Every second they are penetrating
my body...

36:35.690 --> 36:36.952
...and yours.

36:37.158 --> 36:40.423
They don't do much damage. Cosmic
rays have bombarded the Earth...

36:40.661 --> 36:43.255
...for the entire history of
life on our planet.

36:43.464 --> 36:46.058
But they do cause some mutations...

36:46.267 --> 36:49.100
...and they do affect life
on the Earth.

36:51.239 --> 36:54.231
The cosmic rays, mainly protons...

36:54.442 --> 36:59.379
...are penetrating through the meters
of rock in the cave above me.

36:59.580 --> 37:02.276
To do this, they have to
be very energetic and in fact...

37:02.650 --> 37:05.710
...they are traveling almost
at the speed of light.

37:06.521 --> 37:07.920
Think of it.

37:08.389 --> 37:10.857
A star blows up...

37:11.192 --> 37:13.683
...thousands of light-years
away in space...

37:13.895 --> 37:16.693
...and produces cosmic rays which...

37:16.898 --> 37:20.163
...spiral through the Milky Way
galaxy for...

37:20.368 --> 37:23.394
...millions of years until,
quite by accident...

37:23.604 --> 37:26.368
...some of them strike the Earth...

37:26.574 --> 37:30.476
...penetrate this cave,
reach this Geiger counter...

37:30.745 --> 37:32.110
...and us.

37:32.480 --> 37:37.349
The evolution of life on Earth is
driven in part through mutations...

37:37.552 --> 37:40.646
...by the deaths of distant stars.

37:40.855 --> 37:43.653
We are, in a very deep sense...

37:43.891 --> 37:46.621
...tied to the cosmos.

37:49.297 --> 37:52.232
<i>Our ancestors knew this well.</i>

37:52.433 --> 37:55.095
<i>The movements of the sun, the moon,</i>
<i>and the stars...</i>

37:55.303 --> 37:59.899
<i>... could be used by those skilled in</i>
<i>such arts to foretell the seasons.</i>

38:00.107 --> 38:03.042
<i>So the ancient astronomers</i>
<i>all over the world...</i>

38:03.244 --> 38:05.337
<i>... studied the night sky with care...</i>

38:05.546 --> 38:09.607
<i>... memorizing and recording the</i>
<i>position of every visible star.</i>

38:09.817 --> 38:14.220
<i>To them, the appearance of any new</i>
<i>star would have been significant.</i>

38:14.422 --> 38:18.859
<i>What would they have made of the</i>
<i>apparition of a supernova...</i>

38:19.060 --> 38:22.552
<i>... brighter than every other</i>
<i>star in the sky?</i>

38:28.936 --> 38:33.600
On July 4th, in the year 1054...

38:33.808 --> 38:38.745
...Chinese astronomers recorded what
they called a guest star...

38:38.946 --> 38:41.039
...in the constellation of
Taurus the Bull.

38:41.248 --> 38:45.378
A star never before seen
burst into radiance...

38:45.586 --> 38:48.714
...became almost as bright
as the full moon.

38:48.923 --> 38:53.360
Halfway around the world, here in
the American Southwest...

38:53.561 --> 38:58.260
...there was then a high culture,
rich in astronomical tradition.

38:58.466 --> 39:02.698
They too must have seen this
brilliant new star.

39:02.903 --> 39:06.270
From carbon-14 dating...

39:06.507 --> 39:10.967
...of the remains of a charcoal fire,
we know that in this very spot...

39:11.178 --> 39:14.807
...there were people living
in the 11 th century.

39:15.549 --> 39:20.486
The people were the Anasazi, the
antecedents of the Hopi of today.

39:20.988 --> 39:23.889
And one of them
seems to have drawn...

39:24.158 --> 39:27.491
...on this overhang, protected
from the weather...

39:27.695 --> 39:29.686
...a picture of the new star.

39:29.897 --> 39:34.334
Its position near the crescent moon
would have been just what we see here.

39:34.535 --> 39:37.436
And the hand print is, perhaps...

39:37.638 --> 39:40.368
...the artist's signature.

39:41.075 --> 39:45.535
This remarkable star is now
called the Crab Supernova.

39:45.746 --> 39:48.840
"Nova" from the Latin word for new
and "Crab" because...

39:49.050 --> 39:52.247
...that's what an astronomer centuries
later was reminded of...

39:52.453 --> 39:56.253
...when looking at this explosion or
remnant through the telescope.

39:56.457 --> 40:00.450
The Crab is a star that
blew itself up.

40:00.661 --> 40:03.425
The explosion was seen
for three months.

40:03.631 --> 40:07.499
It was easily visible
in broad daylight.

40:07.702 --> 40:10.569
And you could read by it at night.

40:12.707 --> 40:14.834
Imagine the night when that...

40:15.042 --> 40:17.670
...colossal stellar explosion...

40:17.878 --> 40:20.472
...first burst forth.

40:29.657 --> 40:31.056
<i>A thousand years ago...</i>

40:31.292 --> 40:34.819
<i>... people gazed up in amazement</i>
<i>at the brilliant new star...</i>

40:35.029 --> 40:37.463
<i>... and wondered what it was.</i>

40:41.502 --> 40:45.097
<i>We are the first generation</i>
<i>privileged to know the answer.</i>

40:45.306 --> 40:48.571
<i>Through the telescope we have seen</i>
<i>what lies today...</i>

40:48.776 --> 40:52.007
<i>... at the spot in the sky noted</i>
<i>by the ancient astronomers.</i>

40:52.213 --> 40:55.808
<i>A great luminous cloud,</i>
<i>the remains of a star...</i>

40:56.016 --> 41:00.953
<i>... violently unraveling itself back</i>
<i>into interstellar space.</i>

41:06.293 --> 41:09.626
<i>Only the massive red giants</i>
<i>become supernovas.</i>

41:09.830 --> 41:12.924
<i>But every supernova was</i>
<i>once a red giant.</i>

41:13.134 --> 41:14.396
<i>In the history of the galaxy...</i>

41:14.602 --> 41:18.698
<i>... hundreds of millions of red</i>
<i>giants have become supernovas.</i>

41:21.375 --> 41:25.038
<i>The bit of the star that isn't blown</i>
<i>away collapses under gravity...</i>

41:25.246 --> 41:28.511
<i>... spinning ever faster like a
<i>pirouetting ice skater...</i></i>

41:28.716 --> 41:30.047
<i>... bringing in her arms.</i>

41:30.251 --> 41:33.652
<i>The star becomes a single, massive</i>
<i>atomic nucleus...</i>

41:33.854 --> 41:35.515
<i>... a neutron star.</i>

41:35.723 --> 41:38.954
<i>The one in the Crab Nebula</i>
<i>is spinning 30 times a second.</i>

41:39.160 --> 41:41.219
<i>It emits a beamed pattern of light...</i>

41:41.428 --> 41:45.262
<i>... and seems to us to be blinking on</i>
<i>and off with astonishing regularity.</i>

41:45.466 --> 41:49.197
<i>Such neutron stars are</i>
<i>called pulsars.</i>

41:50.838 --> 41:52.863
Neutron star matter...

41:53.073 --> 41:56.975
...weighs about a mountain
per teaspoonful.

41:57.178 --> 42:00.614
So much that if I had a piece of it
here and let it go...

42:00.815 --> 42:03.181
...I could hardly
prevent it from falling.

42:03.384 --> 42:06.319
It would effortlessly pass through the
Earth like a...

42:06.520 --> 42:08.886
...a knife through warm butter.

42:09.089 --> 42:12.490
It would carve a hole for itself
completely through the Earth...

42:12.693 --> 42:16.720
...emerging out the other side
perhaps in China.

42:16.931 --> 42:20.560
The people there might be
walking along when a...

42:20.768 --> 42:25.569
...tiny lump of neutron star matter
comes booming out of the ground...

42:25.773 --> 42:27.400
...and then falls back again.

42:27.608 --> 42:29.041
The incident might...

42:29.276 --> 42:32.939
...make an agreeable break in the
routine of the day.

42:33.147 --> 42:36.548
The neutron star matter, pulled
back by the Earth's gravity...

42:36.750 --> 42:39.218
...would plunge again
through the Earth...

42:39.420 --> 42:43.823
...eventually punching hundreds of
thousands of holes...

42:44.024 --> 42:48.825
...before friction with the interior
of our planet stopped the motion.

42:49.029 --> 42:51.190
By the time it's at rest at
the center of the Earth...

42:51.432 --> 42:56.131
...the inside of our world would look
a little bit like Swiss cheese.

43:11.285 --> 43:15.984
<i>There are places in the galaxy</i>
<i>where a neutron star and a red giant...</i>

43:16.290 --> 43:20.226
<i>... are locked in a mutual</i>
<i>gravitational embrace.</i>

43:20.427 --> 43:22.793
<i>Tendrils of red giant star stuff...</i>

43:22.997 --> 43:25.830
<i>... spiral into a disc</i>
<i>of accreting matter...</i>

43:26.033 --> 43:29.434
<i>... centered on the hot neutron star.</i>

43:39.413 --> 43:42.541
<i>Every star exists in</i>
<i>a state of tension...</i>

43:42.750 --> 43:44.775
<i>... between the force that</i>
<i>holds it up...</i>

43:44.985 --> 43:47.453
<i>... and gravity, the force that</i>
<i>would pull it down.</i>

43:47.655 --> 43:51.989
<i>If gravity were to prevail, a
<i>stellar madness would ensue...</i></i>

43:52.192 --> 43:56.288
<i>... more bizarre than</i>
<i>anything in wonderland.</i>

43:57.898 --> 44:00.799
<i>Alice and her colleagues feel,</i>
<i>more or less...</i>

44:01.001 --> 44:03.561
<i>... at home in the gravitational</i>
<i>pull of the Earth...</i>

44:03.771 --> 44:06.569
<i>... called one g,</i>
<i>"g" for Earth gravity.</i>

44:06.974 --> 44:10.432
<i>What would happen if we made the</i>
<i>gravity less, or more?</i>

44:10.644 --> 44:12.703
<i>At lower gravity, things get lighter.</i>

44:12.913 --> 44:15.677
<i>Near zero g, the slightest motion</i>
<i>sends our friends...</i>

44:15.883 --> 44:17.874
<i>... floating and tumbling in the air.</i>

44:18.085 --> 44:20.883
<i>Little blobs of liquid</i>
<i>tea are everywhere.</i>

44:21.322 --> 44:22.846
<i>Curious.</i>

44:23.390 --> 44:25.858
<i>If we now return the gravity</i>
<i>to one g...</i>

44:26.393 --> 44:30.454
<i>... it's raining tea, and our friends</i>
<i>fall back to Earth.</i>

44:31.832 --> 44:35.324
<i>I've been to a couple of</i>
<i>parties like that myself.</i>

44:37.338 --> 44:40.796
<i>At higher gravities, two or</i>
<i>three g's, say, things get...</i>

44:41.008 --> 44:43.636
<i>... really laid back.</i>

44:43.844 --> 44:47.837
<i>Everyone feels heavy and leaden.</i>

44:50.517 --> 44:53.953
<i>Except by special dispensation...</i>

44:54.254 --> 44:56.017
<i>... the Cheshire cat.</i>

44:56.824 --> 44:59.816
<i>As a kindness, we remove them.</i>

45:00.027 --> 45:03.519
<i>At thousands of g's,</i>
<i>trees become squashed.</i>

45:03.731 --> 45:08.168
<i>At 100,000 g's, rocks</i>
<i>become crushed by their own weight.</i>

45:08.369 --> 45:11.998
<i>At all these gravities, a beam of</i>
<i>light remains unaffected...</i>

45:12.206 --> 45:14.174
<i>... continuing up in a straight line.</i>

45:14.375 --> 45:16.070
<i>But at billions of g's...</i>

45:16.276 --> 45:20.804
<i>... a beam of light feels the gravity</i>
<i>and begins to bend back on itself.</i>

45:21.015 --> 45:24.473
<i>Curiouser and curiouser.</i>

45:24.685 --> 45:28.746
<i>Such a place, where the gravity is so</i>
<i>large that even light can't get out...</i>

45:28.956 --> 45:31.447
<i>... is called a black hole.</i>

45:31.658 --> 45:34.923
<i>It's a star in which light</i>
<i>itself is imprisoned.</i>

45:35.129 --> 45:37.427
<i>Black holes were</i>
<i>theoretical constructs...</i>

45:37.631 --> 45:40.930
<i>... speculated about since 1783.</i>

45:41.135 --> 45:44.730
<i>But in our time, we've</i>
<i>verified the invisible.</i>

45:44.938 --> 45:48.567
<i>This bright star has a
<i>massive, unseen companion.</i></i>

45:48.776 --> 45:53.611
<i>Satellite observatories find the</i>
<i>companion to be an x-ray source...</i>

45:53.814 --> 45:56.339
<i>... called Cygnus X-1.</i>

45:56.550 --> 45:59.110
<i>These x-rays are like</i>
<i>the footprints...</i>

45:59.319 --> 46:04.052
<i>... of an invisible man</i>
<i>walking in the snow.</i>

46:09.363 --> 46:12.423
<i>The x-rays are thought to be</i>
<i>generated by friction...</i>

46:12.633 --> 46:16.125
<i>... in the accretion disc</i>
<i>surrounding the black hole.</i>

46:16.336 --> 46:19.533
<i>The matter in the disc</i>
<i>slowly disappears...</i>

46:19.740 --> 46:21.708
<i>... down the black hole.</i>

46:24.211 --> 46:28.307
<i>Massive black holes, produced by the</i>
<i>collapse of a billion suns...</i>

46:28.515 --> 46:31.109
<i>... may be sitting at the centers</i>
<i>of other galaxies...</i>

46:31.318 --> 46:35.311
<i>... curiously producing great</i>
<i>jets of radiation...</i>

46:35.522 --> 46:37.615
<i>... pouring out into space.</i>

46:40.527 --> 46:44.224
<i>At high enough density,</i>
<i>the star winks out...</i>

46:44.431 --> 46:48.299
<i>... and vanishes from our universe</i>
<i>leaving only its gravity behind.</i>

46:48.502 --> 46:53.337
<i>It slips through a self-generated</i>
<i>crack in the space-time continuum.</i>

46:53.540 --> 46:57.840
<i>A black hole is a place</i>
<i>where a star once was.</i>

46:58.545 --> 47:01.412
Here we have a flat two-
dimensional surface...

47:01.615 --> 47:06.382
...with grid lines on it, something
like a piece of graph paper.

47:07.287 --> 47:09.448
Suppose we take a small mass...

47:09.656 --> 47:14.389
...drop it on the surface and
watch how the surface distorts...

47:14.595 --> 47:18.463
...or puckers into
the third physical dimension.

47:22.336 --> 47:26.773
<i>Gravity can be understood as</i>
<i>a curvature of space.</i>

47:28.509 --> 47:31.535
<i>If our moving ball approaches a
<i>stationary distortion...</i></i>

47:31.745 --> 47:35.112
<i>... it rolls around it like a
<i>planet orbiting the sun.</i></i>

47:35.315 --> 47:39.718
<i>In this interpretation, due to</i>
<i>Einstein, gravity is only a pucker...</i>

47:39.920 --> 47:43.481
<i>... in the fabric of space which</i>
<i>moving objects encounter.</i>

47:43.690 --> 47:48.627
<i>Space is warped by mass into an</i>
<i>additional physical dimension.</i>

47:51.131 --> 47:55.727
The larger the local mass, the
greater is the local gravity...

47:55.936 --> 47:59.394
...and the more intense is
the distortion...

47:59.606 --> 48:02.803
...or pucker, or warp of space.

48:03.010 --> 48:05.103
So, by this analogy...

48:05.312 --> 48:09.942
...a black hole is a kind of
bottomless pit.

48:10.150 --> 48:12.015
What would happen if you fell in?

48:12.219 --> 48:15.416
Assuming you could survive the
gravitational tides...

48:15.622 --> 48:20.286
...and the intense radiation flux,
it is just barely possible...

48:20.494 --> 48:23.588
...that by plunging into
a black hole...

48:23.797 --> 48:27.563
...you might emerge in another
part of space-time.

48:27.768 --> 48:29.463
Somewhere else in space...

48:29.670 --> 48:33.265
...some-when else in time.

48:33.473 --> 48:35.407
In this view, space is...

48:35.609 --> 48:38.601
...filled with a network
of wormholes...

48:38.812 --> 48:40.677
...something like the wormholes
in an apple.

48:40.881 --> 48:43.975
Although by no means is this
point demonstrated...

48:44.184 --> 48:47.381
...it is merely an exciting suggestion.

48:47.588 --> 48:48.987
If it is true...

48:49.189 --> 48:53.182
...then perhaps there exist
gravity tunnels...

48:53.393 --> 48:56.794
...a kind of interstellar or
intergalactic subway...

48:56.997 --> 48:58.726
...which would permit you
to get from...

48:58.932 --> 49:01.423
...here to there in much less than
the usual time.

49:01.635 --> 49:05.594
A kind of cosmic rapid transit system.

49:08.308 --> 49:10.708
<i>We cannot generate black holes...</i>

49:10.911 --> 49:13.641
<i>... our technology is far</i>
<i>too feeble to...</i>

49:13.847 --> 49:16.543
<i>... move such massive amounts</i>
<i>of matter around.</i>

49:16.750 --> 49:19.742
<i>But perhaps someday, it will be</i>
<i>possible to voyage hundreds or...</i>

49:19.953 --> 49:23.821
<i>... thousands of light-years to</i>
<i>a black hole like Cygnus X-1.</i>

49:24.024 --> 49:26.185
<i>We would plunge down to emerge...</i>

49:26.393 --> 49:29.453
<i>... in some unimaginably</i>
<i>exotic time and place.</i>

49:29.663 --> 49:34.327
<i>Our common-sense notions of reality</i>
<i>severely challenged.</i>

49:36.570 --> 49:39.232
<i>Perhaps the cosmos is infested</i>
<i>with wormholes...</i>

49:39.439 --> 49:41.771
<i>... every one of them a
<i>tunnel to somewhere.</i></i>

49:41.975 --> 49:46.207
<i>Perhaps other civilizations, with</i>
<i>vastly more advanced technologies...</i>

49:46.413 --> 49:50.816
<i>... are today riding the</i>
<i>gravity express.</i>

49:53.120 --> 49:56.817
<i>It's even possible that a
<i>black hole is a gate...</i></i>

49:57.024 --> 50:00.391
<i>... to another, and</i>
<i>quite different, universe.</i>

50:38.432 --> 50:40.923
The lives and deaths of the stars...

50:41.134 --> 50:44.535
...seem impossibly remote
from human experience...

50:44.738 --> 50:48.640
...and yet we're related in the most
intimate way to their life cycles.

50:48.842 --> 50:50.810
The very matter that makes us up...

50:51.011 --> 50:55.948
...was generated long ago and far away
in red giant stars.

50:57.050 --> 51:00.713
A blade of grass,
as Walt Whitman said...

51:00.921 --> 51:03.151
<i>"...is the journey work of the stars."</i>

51:03.357 --> 51:04.881
The formation of the solar system...

51:05.092 --> 51:08.220
...may have been triggered by a
nearby supernova explosion.

51:08.428 --> 51:09.918
After the sun turned on...

51:10.130 --> 51:12.963
...its ultraviolet light poured
into our atmosphere.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.157
Its warmth generated lightning.

51:15.369 --> 51:18.270
And these energy sources sparked
the origin of life.

51:19.306 --> 51:21.638
Plants harvest sunlight...

51:21.842 --> 51:24.743
...converting solar into
chemical energy.

51:25.545 --> 51:28.639
We and the other animals are
parasites on the plants.

51:28.849 --> 51:32.785
So we are, all of us, solar-powered.

51:33.186 --> 51:35.677
The evolution of life is
driven by mutations.

51:35.889 --> 51:40.019
They are caused partly by natural
radioactivity and cosmic rays.

51:40.227 --> 51:44.527
But they are both generated in the
spectacular deaths of massive stars...

51:44.731 --> 51:46.722
...thousands of light-years distant.

51:48.268 --> 51:51.897
Think of the sun's heat on your
upturned face...

51:52.105 --> 51:54.369
...on a cloudless summer's day.

51:54.574 --> 51:57.702
From 150 million kilometers away...

51:57.911 --> 52:00.379
...we recognize its power.

52:00.580 --> 52:04.414
What would we feel on its seething,
self-luminous surface...

52:04.618 --> 52:08.076
...or immersed in its heart
of nuclear fire?

52:08.288 --> 52:13.225
And yet, the sun is an ordinary,
even a mediocre star.

52:13.460 --> 52:17.294
Our ancestors worshiped the sun
and they were far from foolish.

52:17.497 --> 52:20.295
It makes good sense to revere
the sun and the stars.

52:20.500 --> 52:24.459
Because we are their children.

52:27.441 --> 52:31.537
<i>We have witnessed the life</i>
<i>cycles of the stars.</i>

52:31.745 --> 52:36.182
<i>They are born, they mature</i>
<i>and then they die.</i>

52:36.383 --> 52:38.647
<i>As time goes on, there are</i>
<i>more white dwarfs...</i>

52:38.852 --> 52:41.343
<i>... more neutron stars,</i>
<i>more black holes.</i>

52:41.555 --> 52:44.388
<i>The remains of the stars accumulate...</i>

52:44.591 --> 52:46.684
<i>... as the eons pass.</i>

52:46.893 --> 52:50.659
<i>But interstellar space also becomes</i>
<i>enriched in heavy elements...</i>

52:50.864 --> 52:54.823
<i>... out of which form new generations</i>
<i>of stars and planets...</i>

52:55.035 --> 52:57.094
<i>... life and intelligence.</i>

52:57.304 --> 53:01.502
<i>The events in one star can influence</i>
<i>a world halfway across the galaxy...</i>

53:01.708 --> 53:03.938
<i>... and a billion years in the future.</i>

53:11.351 --> 53:14.878
<i>The vast interstellar clouds</i>
<i>of gas and dust...</i>

53:15.088 --> 53:16.715
<i>... are stellar nurseries.</i>

53:16.923 --> 53:20.984
<i>Here first begins the inexorable</i>
<i>gravitational collapse...</i>

53:21.194 --> 53:24.254
<i>... which dominates the</i>
<i>lives of the stars.</i>

53:24.464 --> 53:28.867
<i>Massive suns may evolve through the</i>
<i>red giant stage in only millions of years.</i>

53:29.069 --> 53:33.335
<i>Dying young, never leaving the</i>
<i>cloud in which they were born.</i>

53:35.375 --> 53:39.937
<i>Other suns, longer-lived, wander</i>
<i>out of the nursery.</i>

53:40.146 --> 53:42.273
<i>Our sun is such a star...</i>

53:42.482 --> 53:45.542
<i>... as are most</i>
<i>of the stars in the sky.</i>

53:56.730 --> 54:01.292
<i>Most stars are members of double</i>
<i>or multiple star systems...</i>

54:01.501 --> 54:05.801
<i>... and live to process their nuclear</i>
<i>fuel over billions of years.</i>

54:06.006 --> 54:09.066
<i>The galaxy is 10 billion years old.</i>

54:09.276 --> 54:10.868
<i>Old enough to have spawned...</i>

54:11.077 --> 54:14.843
<i>... only a few generations</i>
<i>of ordinary stars.</i>

54:19.653 --> 54:22.986
<i>The objects we encounter</i>
<i>in a voyage through the Milky Way...</i>

54:23.189 --> 54:27.319
<i>... are stages in the life cycle</i>
<i>of the stars.</i>

54:27.527 --> 54:29.757
<i>Some are bright and new...</i>

54:29.963 --> 54:33.956
<i>... and others are as ancient as</i>
<i>the galaxy itself.</i>

54:45.812 --> 54:49.339
<i>Surrounding the Milky Way</i>
<i>is a halo of matter...</i>

54:49.549 --> 54:52.541
<i>... which includes</i>
<i>the globular clusters...</i>

54:52.752 --> 54:56.188
<i>... each containing up to</i>
<i>a million elderly stars.</i>

54:56.389 --> 55:00.758
<i>At the centers of globular clusters</i>
<i>and at the core of the galaxy...</i>

55:00.961 --> 55:05.625
<i>... there may be massive black holes</i>
<i>ticking and purring...</i>

55:05.832 --> 55:08.357
<i>... the subject of future exploration.</i>

55:26.252 --> 55:29.187
<i>We on Earth marvel,</i>
<i>and rightly so...</i>

55:29.389 --> 55:32.415
<i>... at the daily return</i>
<i>of our single sun.</i>

55:32.626 --> 55:36.392
<i>But from a planet orbiting a star</i>
<i>in a distant globular cluster...</i>

55:36.596 --> 55:39.429
<i>... a still more glorious dawn awaits.</i>

55:39.633 --> 55:42.898
<i>Not a sunrise, but a galaxy-rise.</i>

55:43.103 --> 55:46.834
<i>A morning filled with</i>
<i>400 billion suns...</i>

55:47.040 --> 55:49.304
<i>... the rising of the Milky Way.</i>

55:49.509 --> 55:53.411
<i>An enormous spiral form</i>
<i>with collapsing gas clouds...</i>

55:53.613 --> 55:57.344
<i>... condensing planetary systems,</i>
<i>luminous supergiants...</i>

55:57.550 --> 55:59.518
<i>... stable middle-aged stars...</i>

55:59.719 --> 56:04.088
<i>... red giants, white dwarfs, planetary</i>
<i>nebulas, supernovas...</i>

56:04.290 --> 56:08.727
<i>... neutron stars, pulsars,</i>
<i>black holes and...</i>

56:08.962 --> 56:11.931
<i>... there is every reason to think,</i>
<i>other exotic objects...</i>

56:12.165 --> 56:14.360
<i>... that we have not yet discovered.</i>

56:17.370 --> 56:21.238
<i>From such a world, high above</i>
<i>the disc of the Milky Way...</i>

56:21.441 --> 56:25.468
<i>... it would be clear as it is</i>
<i>beginning to be clear on our world...</i>

56:25.679 --> 56:28.739
<i>... that we are made</i>
<i>by the atoms in the stars...</i>

56:28.948 --> 56:33.009
<i>... that our matter</i>
<i>and our form are determined...</i>

56:33.219 --> 56:36.814
<i>... by the cosmos</i>
<i>of which we are a part.</i>

56:45.165 --> 56:49.431
I only have a moment, but I wanted you
to see a picture of Betelgeuse...

56:49.636 --> 56:51.570
...in the constellation Orion.

56:51.771 --> 56:54.865
The first image of the surface
of another star.

56:55.141 --> 56:57.803
But the most exciting recent
stellar discovery...

56:58.011 --> 56:59.842
...has been of a nearby supernova...

57:00.046 --> 57:02.241
...in a companion galaxy
to the Milky Way.

57:02.449 --> 57:06.749
We are here seeing chemical elements
in the process of synthesis...

57:06.953 --> 57:10.514
...and have had our first glimpse
of the supernova...

57:10.724 --> 57:13.887
...through a brand-new field:
neutrino astronomy.

57:14.094 --> 57:17.291
And we're now seeing, around
neighboring stars...

57:17.864 --> 57:21.561
...discs of gas and dust just
like those needed to explain...

57:21.768 --> 57:24.498
...the origin of the planets
in our solar system.

57:24.704 --> 57:27.434
Worlds may be forming here.

57:27.640 --> 57:30.905
It's like a snapshot of our
solar system's past.

57:31.344 --> 57:34.472
And there are so many such
discs being found these days...

57:34.681 --> 57:39.209
...that planets may be very common
among the stars of the Milky Way.
