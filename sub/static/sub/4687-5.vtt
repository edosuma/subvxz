WEBVTT

01:25.335 --> 01:28.588
Since I got here,
you're my third contempt of court.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.631
First one was a contested traffic ticket.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.716
The guy cursed at the judge.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.426
The second one was a lawyer.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.803
-What'd he do?
-He cursed at the judge.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.264
--You're my first reporter.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.641
-I'm Will. I'd shake your hand...
-I know who you are.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.687
So the traffic ticket,
he was just here for a night.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.564
But the lawyer was here for a weekend.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.484
Three nights, and you could tell
he was starting to go a little...

01:49.568 --> 01:52.987
You know, it affected him.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.743
You're gonna be locked in a cage now,
and it's not a natural thing.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.495
Go ahead.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.705
That's yours over here.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.793
-You got toiletries?
-I'm sorry?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.377
You didn't bring toiletries?

02:08.462 --> 02:10.463
Uh, no, I didn't.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.340
I'll bring you toothpaste and a brush.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.509
I can bring you a book from the library
if you want.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.261
-You might get the whole weekend.
-Sure, thanks.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.597
You'll be fine.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.282
You fish.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.243
I'm sorry?

02:40.911 --> 02:42.662
You're a fisherman.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.874
Yeah. No. Not in a long time.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.794
That's a nice fish.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.838
-Yeah.
-Eight pounds.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.881
You know, I don't really remember.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.508
And that's your father there next to you?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.594
-Yeah.
-That's a wholesome picture.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.346
Looks like it came with the frame.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.682
-Yeah.
-And that's your wife?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.433
Yeah, her name is MacKenzie.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.853
-Whew, she's a knockout.
-She is.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.189
-It's okay if I say that, right?
-Sure.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.276
And those are your, what?
Your friends, your colleagues?

03:13.944 --> 03:17.280
Yeah, they're some of the people I work with.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.115
We work close together.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.243
-You have to explain it to me one more time.
-Really?

03:22.327 --> 03:24.996
'Cause every time you say it,
it sounds like you're in here voluntarily.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.497
I promise you, I'm not.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.499
But you can walk out any time you want.

03:28.584 --> 03:32.962
No, I can't. I can only walk out
if I reveal the identity of a source.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.007
-You want to read your book.
-I don't want to be rude.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.887
You didn't ask me what I was in for.
I appreciate that.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.600
Domestic battery.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.393
Nine women on the jury.

03:48.687 --> 03:52.231
My PD was a woman,
so she wasn't exactly my champion.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.191
The prosecutor was a woman.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.985
The judge was a woman.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.904
I mean,
is that even constitutional?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.406
The PD wanted me to plea six months.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.034
But I wanted to fight it. Two years.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.828
That wasn't your first offense, though.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.580
How do you know?

04:07.664 --> 04:11.000
You wouldn't have gotten two years
for domestic battery if it was your first...

04:11.084 --> 04:13.002
It was my third. Strike three.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.255
Oh, are you judging me now?

04:16.340 --> 04:18.090
'Cause a judge just did that. I don't need it.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.009
-No.
-Yeah, you are.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.637
I have an idea.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.430
Tell me the name of the source.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.474
I didn't make a pledge or anything.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.644
I'll tell it to them
on the condition they let us both go.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.103
It's a hell of a plan.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.356
Or I could just shake the name out of you.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.483
Stand up.

04:38.737 --> 04:42.156
I want you to see that I got four inches on you
and you're giving up 30 pounds.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.783
I'm not your wife.

04:43.867 --> 04:47.703
Raise your hands above your hips
and I'll knock you the fuck into next week.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.673
Your father was a drunk, wasn't he?

05:02.260 --> 05:05.012
You aren't a consumer,
<i>you're a citizen.</i>

05:05.097 --> 05:07.640
<i>You aren't an audience, you're an activist.</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:10.142
<i>You aren't a viewer, you're ACN.</i>

05:10.227 --> 05:12.770
<i>You are ACN.</i>

05:21.947 --> 05:23.072
Which one of you...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.825
It's exactly as offensive as I thought
it was gonna be when I heard about it.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.035
-Offensive to whom?
-Me. And him.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.288
And Will and Sloan
and everyone who works here, and you.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.083
-We are ACN.
-It's a slogan. It doesn't mean anything.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.669
First, I wouldn't be relieved
that our new slogan doesn't mean anything.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.254
-I meant...
-But it isn't a slogan.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.381
It's a statement of our new direction.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.759
We're gonna cover the conversation
because this is just the first one.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.847
Next one's gonna show citizen journalists
filing stories from the Coffee Bean.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.016
-Don?
-It looks like urine.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.100
- It doesn't.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.476
You're just complaining for the sake of it.

05:52.561 --> 05:57.440
The best graphics house in the UK
was paid $700,000 to build that spot.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.317
I don't mean the animation. U-r-a-c-n.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.361
Our brains are trained
to see groups of letters as a word

06:02.446 --> 06:04.864
and visually,
that group of letters looks like urine.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.325
Maybe if we separate the U and the R.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.535
Maybe, but the best you can hope for

06:09.619 --> 06:11.746
is something with the gravitas
of a vanity license plate.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.540
Maybe we should
ask people to vote. After all, they are ACN.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.583
You know, Mac...

06:15.667 --> 06:17.460
Young people know
when they're being patronized.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.045
Everybody knows
when they're being patronized.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.047
I've been hearing this for 52 days.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.382
Because in 52 days,

06:23.467 --> 06:26.135
I've put three Twitter monitors on our set.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.513
Passing weather systems
are reported like al-Qaeda sleeper cells.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.392
And a total of 84 air minutes
have been spent on the mayor of Toronto

06:33.477 --> 06:35.728
while zero minutes
have been spent on the mayor of Detroit

06:35.812 --> 06:39.065
whose city is about
two minutes away from bankruptcy.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.400
Also in that 52 days, we've gone from fourth

06:41.485 --> 06:43.360
to third in households
and second in the demo.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.737
--In seven weeks,

06:44.821 --> 06:48.407
the average age of our audience
has dropped three years.

06:48.492 --> 06:53.996
And we did all that while still managing
to cover a military takeover in Egypt

06:54.081 --> 06:58.417
and most recently,
a pretty big scandal involving the NSA.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.504
We've got two reporters
at the Moscow Airport right now.

07:01.671 --> 07:05.132
Two. So can you do me a favor and not worry

07:05.217 --> 07:09.845
that the world's most benign promo
is a threat to democracy?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.555
-Sure.
-You?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.599
-Can I have a second?
-Yeah.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.229
So, the Princeton story. The website.

07:18.855 --> 07:22.858
There is an epidemic
of campus sexual assault in this country.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.819
It's a perfectly legitimate story.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.988
In fact, it's an important one,
so what's your fucking problem?

07:28.073 --> 07:29.615
I agree.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.284
-I just don't know how to do the story.
-I don't understand.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.245
I don't know how to do it.
I'm looking for some guidance.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.163
You interview the student with the website.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.207
You interview
one of the guys who's been accused.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.458
Why is it complicated?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.585
Well, it's complicated for a lot of reasons,

07:41.670 --> 07:44.213
and one of them is that
Pruit wants them both in the studio.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.465
-He told you that?
-He called me.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.098
He shouldn't be speaking directly to you.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.308
And he shouldn't be making those decisions.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.560
But if that's what he wants,

07:57.644 --> 07:59.562
- why don't you just do it?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.152
Well, like I said, I don't know how to.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.486
Bullshit.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.405
You do know how.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.076
And if you don't,
I need to hire someone who does, man.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.828
Okay?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.330
Yeah.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.083
Anything else?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.877
No.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.558
Anything happen over the weekend
I should know about?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.351
Not much.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.021
Dilma Rousseff pledged
to speak with protestors.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.064
-The House voted down the Farm Bill.
-Yeah, I saw that.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.484
France is sending Syrian rebels
17.6 tons of medical aid.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.695
I'm sure that's going to get
where it's supposed to go.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.780
A woman named
Lilly M. Hart shot herself in the mouth

08:51.865 --> 08:53.824
on the steps in front
of the Justice Department.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.326
We're not sure what she was protesting,

08:55.410 --> 08:58.078
but her bio had
a lot of gun control advocacy in it.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.497
She was protesting guns by shooting herself?

09:00.582 --> 09:02.750
The FBI isn't releasing
any information right now.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.127
-You mean DC Police.
-No, the FBI is handling it.

09:05.212 --> 09:08.214
-Why?
-They won't release that information either.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.465
Anything else?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.383
Kim and Kanye named their baby North.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.427
There's our top story.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.263
What was her name?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.265
North. North West.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.976
No, the woman
who shot herself in front of the DOJ.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.728
Lilly Hart.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.397
Again, I don't know how...

09:27.067 --> 09:28.234
What?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.280
She wasn't protesting guns.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.202
They said it was an emergency.
Is everything okay?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.246
Do we have attorney-client privilege,
you and me?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.248
-I'm not your lawyer.
-What if you were?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.083
Then we would have that privilege.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.754
I'm hiring you right now on a $20 retainer.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.798
-Do I need to sign something?
-No. What's going on?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.925
I know the name of the source.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.469
I've known since the party
after the Correspondents' Dinner.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.596
And the day before yesterday,
she shot and killed herself

09:57.681 --> 09:59.556
on the steps outside the DOJ.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.518
-The woman... She was the source?
-Yeah.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.062
Who else knows the name?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.022
Neal, obviously, Will, and I. That's it.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.608
-Not the DC Police?
-I think they must...

10:09.985 --> 10:11.151
Excuse me.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.321
Thank you.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.365
Lasenthal on the phone.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.452
You know what?

10:20.954 --> 10:23.122
Your husband is getting out of jail today.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.802
I was just chewed out for
10 minutes by Erin Andrews.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.929
-Why?
-She was accosted by paparazzi last night

10:39.014 --> 10:40.889
coming out of Man of Steel
at the El Capitan in LA.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.474
Paparazzi were coming out of the El Capitan?

10:42.559 --> 10:43.726
-She...
-She was coming.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.145
She'd just seen the movie
and waiting for her were a pack of paparazzi.

10:46.229 --> 10:47.313
Got it. Why was she chewing you out?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.480
I'm the one here she knows the best.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.565
Didn't she have an affair with Will?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.650
It wasn't an affair.
Neither of them were married.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.820
No, that didn't happen. Will's in jail
at the moment. And none of this is the point.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.906
The paparazzi knew she was in there
because of our creepy stalker app.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.658
I'm coming to you as my superior,

10:59.743 --> 11:02.328
which I mean only in a sense of
our organizational chart,

11:02.412 --> 11:03.996
and pleading with you
to have what's his name...

11:04.080 --> 11:05.956
-Bree.
-Bree shut down the app.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.791
Mac's been fighting that battle for six weeks.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.794
-And what have you been doing?
-Just, you know, my job.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.505
Which should now include
getting the assassin's helper taken down.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.840
-I'm on it.
-When?

11:14.924 --> 11:18.510
Well, I'm in the middle of a tricky... Now.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.637
-Right now.
-There you go.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.435
Excuse me, Bree.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.188
Excuse me.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.568
Hey, easy.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.612
-I just wanted to talk to you about something.
-You are?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.822
He's Don Keefer, executive producer...
You know who he is.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.657
And you run our website
until Neal Sampat's back.

11:40.742 --> 11:41.742
I wanted to...

11:41.826 --> 11:44.244
I'm senior editor of ACN Digital,
if you're going to be insulting.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.455
-Nobody wants to be insulting.
-I badly want to be insulting.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.248
Here's the thing.
Sloan got a call from Erin Andrews...

11:48.333 --> 11:49.458
- You know Erin Andrews?
- Yes.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.877
Yowza. I want to get with that so bad.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.713
I'll pass that on.
I'm sure she'll want you to have her number.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.715
-Hey, fuck you.
-Yeah?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.468
-Oh, you can't talk to her like that, my friend.
-What's the problem here?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.136
Erin Andrews got stalked
by paparazzi last night

12:01.221 --> 12:02.221
coming out of the movies.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.390
-I know, we've got it up.
-Now we're in Peabody country.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.183
You're here to give me shit
about the app again.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.852
Yes. Restraining Order. Scum Bottle Guide.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.646
-Whatever it's called.
-ACNgage.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.272
It should be called ACInvoluntary Engage.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.982
I'll bring that up at our next staff meeting.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.485
-You guys like ACInvoluntary Engage?
-No.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.903
It got voted down.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.156
Listen, no kidding around, you need
to disable the app until we can figure this out,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.783
'cause it's a little not what we do.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.201
What's not what you do?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.412
Giving deranged people
with access to semiautomatic weapons

12:26.496 --> 12:27.704
the locations of their targets,

12:27.789 --> 12:30.165
while simultaneously
turning the rest of our brains into Wheatena.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.708
That app's driving a lot of traffic.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.585
I don't care if it's driving
in the Grand Prix of Monaco.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.003
I need you to temporarily take it down.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.506
- Then permanently take it down.
- You need to speak to my boss.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.757
-He's your boss.
-I'm your boss.

12:38.842 --> 12:42.052
Lucas Pruit is my boss. I pitched him the app
and he loved it, which is why we have it.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.971
This is a warmed-over version
of the same app Gawker had

12:44.055 --> 12:45.639
and took down five years ago.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.641
They still have a version of it,
but this one's better.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.725
- Look...
- No, you look.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.229
We're all a little tired of being treated
like we're not Neal Sampat.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.440
I like my app and it makes money,

12:54.524 --> 12:56.275
both of which are more
than I can say for your 10:00 hour.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.652
So if you have a problem,
and I got a hunch you got more than a few,

12:58.736 --> 13:00.571
why don't you take it to Pruit?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.283
- Beat him up.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.245
No, he's right.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.955
Yeah, he's... What?

13:10.039 --> 13:12.916
About the last thing he said.
About the last thing you said.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.543
We haven't been very welcoming

13:14.627 --> 13:17.212
and in a weird way
we've been blaming him for Neal.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.091
If Digital can help us,
we should be supporting Digital.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.635
-That's right.
-Yeah.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.471
Come on the show
and tell people about your app.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.599
Seriously?

13:28.683 --> 13:31.268
I'll ask MacKenzie for a block
and I'll interview you.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.479
All right. Awesome.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.647
An associate producer
will give you the details.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.566
-You should apologize.
-Sorry.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.651
-To him.
-Habit. Sorry.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.153
Were you serious about that phone number?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.489
Yeah, but I think you can do better.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.365
-For real?
-I'm on it.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.706
Okay, so when you vivisect this guy

13:52.790 --> 13:55.083
and especially his app,
Pruit's not gonna be happy.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.668
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.712
You usually blow up that bridge
when you come to it.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.131
Would you mind giving me some space?
I have a show to prepare.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.591
Sure, but this is my office.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.218
Yes, it is. Sorry.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.302
Hang on.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.597
There's an undergrad at Princeton
who started a website

14:08.681 --> 14:09.806
for students who have been raped,

14:09.891 --> 14:12.684
but who don't have enough evidence
for the police to take action.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.563
Victims can go onto the site
either anonymously or not

14:16.648 --> 14:20.108
and name names
and describe their experiences.

14:20.193 --> 14:24.571
Pruit wants the undergrad
and one of the accused in the studio.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.031
-That's a terrible idea.
-I know.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.491
-Do you have a better one?
-Don't do it?

14:27.575 --> 14:30.035
Do you have a better one
where I get to keep my job?

14:30.119 --> 14:31.203
Charlie's gonna back you.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.788
Charlie told me to do it.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.459
What's happening to him?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.548
I think you should consider
letting me do the talking.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.217
At least at the top.
We won't have much time with him

14:45.301 --> 14:48.929
and I want to ask him, obviously, the extent
to which they've been keeping metadata,

14:49.013 --> 14:51.223
how much the agency
learns from this kind of information,

14:51.307 --> 14:55.269
and in what ways the FISA reports have
provided insufficient oversight of the NSA.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.230
I want to ask him at what point he
decided to declare war on the United States.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.440
So I think you should
let me get the ball rolling.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.068
You and your whole generation's
contempt for institutions.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.111
I'm two years younger than you.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.904
With your hair,
and your clothes and your music.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.406
Here it is. Here's the gate.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.532
You sure?

15:08.616 --> 15:11.577
It says, departs for Havana at 11:55 p.m.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.746
-Are you sure?
-We had a nine-hour flight from New York.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.291
I was brushing up on my Russian
with my Russian phrase book,

15:17.375 --> 15:20.752
<i>or Russkiy razgovornik, while you</i>
were watching Star Wars on your iPad.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.546
<i>Trek. Star Trek.</i>

15:22.630 --> 15:25.007
Both excellent examples of genius,

15:25.091 --> 15:27.009
-but different in every imaginable...
-Yeah, shut up.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.719
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.143
Then we'll speak in English.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.894
You're American press, yes?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.772
I have not seen Edward Snowden.
I do not know where he is.

15:40.857 --> 15:44.276
That's all right. We just wanna check in
for the midnight flight to Havana.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.486
That's Aeroflot seven, departing 11:55?

15:46.571 --> 15:49.114
Yes. Margaret Jordan and James Humdrum.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.198
Harper.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.494
That guy's from ABC's Moscow bureau.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.332
And that's Reuters and that's Le Monde.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.667
He's going to Cuba.
He's gonna be on this flight.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.961
I do not show
reservation for Margaret Jordan.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.838
-Really?
-I'll try Humdrum.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.340
Harper. James Harper.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.926
The office bought our tickets
while we were in the air.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.262
I do not show reservation for Harper.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.764
Would you mind checking again?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.432
What do you think will
happen the second time?

16:17.518 --> 16:20.020
Would you ask her to check again?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.606
-Would you mind checking again?
-In Russian.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.609
I understood in English.
And I have checked again.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.654
And lo and behold, got the same result.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.156
All right.
Can we have two coach seats to Havana?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.075
-The flight is sold out.
-Of course it is.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.242
I'll call the office.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.912
Unless the office can build two seats

16:36.996 --> 16:38.497
and install them on the plane
in the next four hours,

16:38.581 --> 16:40.082
it's not gonna do any good.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.546
Excuse me. Do you speak English?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.174
-Agence France.
-You speak French. Great.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.343
-I speak English, too.
-Okay.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.138
'Cause when I said... It doesn't matter.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.183
I would like to buy your ticket from you
at a substantial markup.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.560
-How substantial?
-Twice what your office paid for it.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.688
You can catch the next
flight and pocket the difference.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.690
-That's a good deal.
-Yes, it is.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.483
I don't have a ticket for the flight.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.318
-You don't?
-No.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.653
What are you doing here?

17:09.737 --> 17:12.698
I'm here to photograph Mr. Snowden.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.450
This is a very big story. You agree?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.119
I do.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.704
I do agree.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.462
We have to get on this flight.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.719
When did you decide
you wanted to be a TV news anchor?

17:33.803 --> 17:35.971
Do you know how long
this interview is gonna take?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.349
-You've got someplace else you're going?
-No.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.685
When did you decide you
wanted to be a TV news anchor?

17:41.769 --> 17:44.396
I didn't. I was a prosecutor.
Then I was a speechwriter.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.232
Then I was the legal correspondent
for my network and I got promoted.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.110
-You were a prosecutor?
-The Brooklyn DA's office.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.904
You aren't afraid you're gonna run
into some of the people you sent here?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.781
That's why I'm supposed to be in solitary.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.658
And you were what kind of writer?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.744
Speechwriter.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.245
What does that mean?

18:00.580 --> 18:03.749
I helped write speeches
for the first President Bush.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.752
I worked on his campaign and when he won,
they brought me to the White House.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.921
No kidding? George H.W.?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.424
-Yeah.
-Did you ever meet him?

18:12.508 --> 18:13.508
Yeah.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.178
Ah. I liked him.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.847
He was an elite
Harvard silver spoon and all that,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.432
but he didn't rub it in your face, you know?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.976
-He went to Yale.
-He didn't do that.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.395
He didn't make people feel stupid.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.606
-That's not what I was doing.
-What?

18:27.690 --> 18:30.275
You were just saying that to the fatheads,

18:30.359 --> 18:32.652
there's no difference
between Yale and Harvard.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.113
But to the refined palate
of the eastern elite,

18:35.198 --> 18:36.740
-the subtle nuances...
-Jesus, I'm from Nebraska!

18:36.824 --> 18:38.700
You still got that
northeastern air of superiority.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.785
I'm in jail!

18:39.869 --> 18:41.620
And even in here
you still think you're better than me.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.290
You hit a woman, man.
You don't set the bar very high.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.751
- Will.
- Yeah?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.378
-You've got visitors.
-On a Monday?

18:57.220 --> 18:59.638
-I'll be outside the door.
-You look good.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.306
Yeah, you say that every week.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.058
It's true every week.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.351
How you holding up?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.645
I'm good. What's this about?

19:06.729 --> 19:09.773
He's going to ask you a couple of
questions I've already approved.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.317
But if you need a minute, take a minute.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.736
-He'll step outside.
-What's going on?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.404
The day before yesterday, Saturday morning,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.949
a woman named Lilly Hart committed suicide

19:19.033 --> 19:22.077
by shooting herself in the head
on the steps of the Justice Department.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.870
Does the name Lilly Hart
mean anything to you?

19:23.955 --> 19:25.121
That wasn't one
of the questions we went over.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.415
-All right.
-Stick to the script.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.960
Lilly Hart worked for BCD.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.921
Her roommate and some of her friends
were trying to put the pieces together,

19:33.005 --> 19:34.631
trying to figure out why she killed herself

19:34.715 --> 19:36.675
-and so theatrically.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.511
Her roommate starts going through her emails
and then some files,

19:39.595 --> 19:42.013
and she finds some things
which are alarming enough

19:42.098 --> 19:46.101
for her to bring to the attention
of some agents who sweep the entire laptop.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.938
Will you confirm Lilly Hart as your source?

19:51.649 --> 19:52.816
No, sir.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.111
Will you deny that she was your source?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.696
No, sir.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.990
-You're not under oath.
-I understand.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.992
Lilly Hart has no family.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.619
Both her parents died
in a car crash years ago.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.204
She's single with no children.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.999
There's no one to protect anymore.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.710
Confirm the name,

20:11.794 --> 20:13.837
and I'll inform the judge that the government

20:13.921 --> 20:17.173
no longer needs your testimony
and has withdrawn their subpoena

20:17.258 --> 20:20.677
and you'll be having dinner
with your wife in your home tonight.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.845
Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.724
I'm not allowed to reveal the name of a source
without their permission.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.809
Well, that option was taken off the table

20:27.894 --> 20:30.687
when your source
put a loaded Beretta 9mm Nano

20:30.771 --> 20:32.272
in her mouth and squeezed the trigger.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.065
Don't do that. Don't try the side door.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.402
Look, confirm that she's the source
and Neal comes home from Venezuela.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.112
We'll buy the ticket. First class.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.072
And you won't pursue criminal prosecution?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.949
We'll give him an ice cream cone.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.494
Will you confirm
that Lilly Hart was your source?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.331
No, sir.

20:50.708 --> 20:51.750
Will you deny it?

20:51.834 --> 20:53.209
No, sir.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.049
Neal would pummel me if I got him
back by giving up the name of the source.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.134
Did you think
I was gonna consider a deal like this?

21:01.218 --> 21:04.930
I wrote down exactly what I thought you'd say
and sealed it in this envelope.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.951
Can I speak to him?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.410
<i>He's back in his cell.</i>

21:29.246 --> 21:30.538
Mac.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.791
When are they gonna be absolutely sure?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.751
What percent of certainty will it take?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.379
-I'm gonna find out.
<i>-What if we switch places?</i>

21:37.713 --> 21:40.632
<i>-I have the exact same information Will has.</i>
-Mac.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.219
What if you convinced them I was
softer and more likely to give up the name?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.345
<i>-Are you?</i>
-No.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.055
--Just a second.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.099
-What if you told them that...
-Listen to me.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.101
'Cause here's your $20 worth.

21:51.185 --> 21:54.020
You don't tell anyone
you know what Will knows.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.398
You want your friends to be
subpoenaed and get sworn in?

21:56.482 --> 21:58.608
No. Come on in.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.694
Keep calling me.
I want to hear from you once an hour.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.489
-What's going on?
-I need a block tonight. Five minutes, 4:30.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.408
-For what?
-I want to interview Bree Dorrit.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.411
Isn't that the temporary ACN Digital editor?

22:09.495 --> 22:10.495
Yeah.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.539
Why do you want to interview
someone who works for us?

22:12.623 --> 22:14.499
I want to discuss an app he has...

22:14.583 --> 22:17.877
We have called
Human Flesh Hunter or something.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.504
I know I've missed some meetings,

22:19.588 --> 22:22.215
but we really don't have an app
called Hunting Human Flesh?

22:22.299 --> 22:24.092
No. Maybe. I don't know.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.344
I don't like to do stories about us.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.430
I know, but this is about everyone.

22:34.228 --> 22:37.605
Lady Gaga has been
relatively silent on Twitter

22:37.732 --> 22:40.692
since her hip surgery last February.

22:40.776 --> 22:45.488
But today she broke her silence
and tweeted in support of...

22:45.573 --> 22:46.740
In defense of...

22:46.824 --> 22:50.618
In support of overturning
the Defense of Marriage Act.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.288
Sloan's going to interview her manager.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.460
You're still able to hear
yourself when you speak, right?

22:58.711 --> 23:01.546
-Yeah.
-I'm glad Lady Gaga wants to engage people...

23:01.630 --> 23:03.256
She has 40 million Twitter followers.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.384
Does her manager bring expertise
to the table on marriage equality?

23:06.469 --> 23:08.720
What kind of expertise
is there on that subject?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.013
Someone who's familiar with state legislature.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.182
-Just block out the time.
-We don't have the time tonight.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.516
We only have him for one night.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.144
Well, I don't want to get
scooped on Gaga's manager.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.937
Hey, you know what, Mac?

23:18.022 --> 23:21.733
How about she brings 40 million
people to a civil rights debate?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.527
I don't think gay couples
who'd just like to move

23:24.612 --> 23:26.946
the fuck on with their lives
are as choosy about that discussion.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.448
It was trending, Charlie. It still is.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.951
Lady Gaga's tweets,
they're trending number one.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.579
So Pruit picked up
the phone and said, "Do this."

23:34.663 --> 23:37.248
That's why you book her manager,
to report on the tweets.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.583
Whatever. Put it in the rundown.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.585
-I don't have room.
-There's always room.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.754
Tell me what you'd like to cut.

23:42.838 --> 23:47.008
The Supreme Court struck down portions
of the Voting Rights Act this morning.

23:47.093 --> 23:51.262
IAF fighter jets attacked the Gaza Strip
after rockets were fired at southern Israel.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.932
Ed Markey won
John Kerry's seat in the Senate.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.600
-Snowden's on his way to Cuba.
-Cut my thing.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.060
I didn't have the time for it anyway.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.603
- What was it?
- Nothing.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.522
-ACNgage?
-Yeah, how'd you know?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.607
-Pruit wants it.
-How did he know?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.860
The guy, Bree,
he's got a relationship with Pruit.

24:05.945 --> 24:10.115
He told him you were putting him
on the air and Pruit liked it.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.449
It's a promo for the site.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.119
Yeah, that is what it is.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.454
You'll have to cut something else
or make trims.

24:16.539 --> 24:19.124
In an historic 5-4 decision,

24:19.208 --> 24:22.210
the US Supreme Court did something
that we'll tell you about tomorrow.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.295
-We're clear, right?
-We are.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.595
-I'm really sorry.
-Not your fault.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.141
Tell me about the five-minute interview
we're going to do with ourselves.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.902
You sure you wouldn't rather
do this someplace else?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.946
Those are the Footnotes.

24:50.030 --> 24:53.992
The pitch pipe lives in the room next door
and they practice there sometimes.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.327
You get used to it. It's kind of nice.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.413
I just meant...

24:58.497 --> 25:02.125
If I can avoid it, I'd rather not be alone
with a young woman in her dorm room.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.253
You want witnesses in case
I say you forced yourself on me.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.172
-No, no.
-Don.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.506
-Yeah?
-I was raped.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.759
-I wasn't worried...
-I was raped.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.845
I went to a party at one of the eating clubs.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.263
I drank too much tequila.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.932
There was molly, there was coke,
there were mushrooms,

25:18.017 --> 25:19.851
and I took anything
that was put in front of me.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.770
I wound up in a bathroom
throwing up and then passing out.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.858
And the next thing I knew,
two guys were helping me into a bedroom.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.735
They told me I needed to lie down.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.654
When we got in there,
they took my clothes off

25:31.739 --> 25:34.240
and they took turns raping me.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.123
And the next day you called the police?

25:42.208 --> 25:45.210
City police, campus police,
and the DA's office.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.879
I know who the two guys are
and I know where they live.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.715
That should be the easiest arrest
they're ever gonna make.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.051
-Nobody pursued it.
-The kind of rape you're talking about

25:53.135 --> 25:55.762
-is difficult and usually impossible to prove.
-It's not a kind of rape.

25:55.846 --> 25:56.846
Sure.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.896
How did you find me?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.315
-The original email?
-Yeah.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.400
Just some detective work.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.402
I really want to know.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.239
Well, on the web page there's a bio.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.366
You say you're a third-year psych major.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.285
And later you say you live
across from Dillon Gym

26:19.370 --> 26:21.829
and one of these days
you're gonna start working out.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.666
-You also wrote that you love the Phat Lady.
-Right.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.918
I got a list of
all female psych majors on campus

26:27.002 --> 26:29.337
and cross-referenced it with
students living in the upperclassmen dorms

26:29.421 --> 26:31.589
across from the gym,
which brought me to Cuyler Hall.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.632
<i>Wow...</i>

26:32.716 --> 26:35.385
I asked some people in my office
if they knew the band the Phat Lady.

26:35.469 --> 26:38.596
-Really?
-And a Princeton grad laughed and said...

26:38.681 --> 26:39.847
It's a sandwich.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.351
It is the most popular sandwich
not on the menu at Hoagie Haven.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.437
So we went to Costa,
one of the managers at Hoagie Haven,

26:46.522 --> 26:48.982
with pictures of the four female
psych majors living at Cuyler Hall

26:49.066 --> 26:51.442
and asked him if any were regular customers.

26:51.527 --> 26:54.070
He pointed at your picture and
said, "That's my girl, Mary."

26:54.154 --> 26:56.990
That's a lot of detective work.
That's old school.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.158
I was trying to impress my boss.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.536
-My boss' boss.
-Did it work?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.955
He wants you in the studio along with Jeff.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.874
At the same time.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.171
Elliot Hirsch would be moderating,
I guess you'd call it.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.299
It's very promotable.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.301
It'd bring a lot of new viewers to my show,

27:16.385 --> 27:19.721
a lot of younger viewers
who drive a lot of Internet traffic.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.472
And I'd score some points at work.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.349
And you're here for a pre-interview.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.226
I'm here to beg you not to do it.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.992
The travel office
transferred me to talent relations,

27:41.076 --> 27:42.869
who transferred me to Tess, who said,

27:42.953 --> 27:46.331
"It's so romantic that you guys
are on a stakeout together

27:46.415 --> 27:48.666
"in the Moscow Airport. You're his destiny."

27:48.751 --> 27:52.462
I said, "Tess, we were supposed to have
tickets waiting to Havana."

27:52.546 --> 27:54.172
She said, "Hang on, let me check."

27:54.256 --> 27:56.716
Then she got back on the phone and said,

27:56.800 --> 27:59.135
"Did you know there's more than
one city named Havana?"

27:59.219 --> 28:00.595
We have tickets to Spain?

28:00.679 --> 28:03.306
There are layovers in Dvinsk,
Rotterdam, and Berlin.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.475
And we change planes in Madrid.
How's it looking here?

28:05.559 --> 28:08.269
There are three people in front of us,
five people in back of us.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.022
As passengers come to claim their seats,
the people in back get dismissed.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.566
It's like that last helicopter out of Saigon.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.026
I know how standby works.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.070
I was answering your question.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.744
It really would have
killed you to apologize to Hallie?

28:24.828 --> 28:26.829
You would have gotten sick and died?

28:26.914 --> 28:28.706
As soon as you said the word romantic...

28:28.791 --> 28:31.042
-I didn't say it, Tess did.
-You recounted it.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.086
I was telling a funny story.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.254
As soon as you said romantic,
I knew we were heading for Hallie.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.714
After all, it's been two hours.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.008
-You would have tragically died from...
-I did apologize.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.302
"I'm sorry I overreacted.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.889
"In fact, I'm so sorry
that I sent this apology in a text."

28:44.973 --> 28:46.599
How should it have been delivered?

28:46.683 --> 28:49.143
-In person, for starters.
-She doesn't want to see me.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.270
You know what you should do?

28:51.355 --> 28:52.522
Tess thinks you're my destiny?

28:52.606 --> 28:53.773
-Call her right now.
-Tess?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.566
Hallie. Call her right now.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.652
You're halfway around the world
on a big story,

28:57.736 --> 28:59.487
but you just wanted to hear her voice.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.030
Do you want her back, Jim?

29:01.115 --> 29:02.156
Those two are on the plane.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.492
-Do you want her back?
-Of course.

29:04.576 --> 29:08.121
Then do what I'm telling you
and wait for further instructions.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.456
-Do it.
-You can hold our place?

29:10.541 --> 29:12.875
Yeah, I think I can handle
standing on the ground.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.210
'Cause it's not a bad idea.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.212
Don't get into any, you know, areas.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.673
Just tell her you wanted to hear her voice

29:18.757 --> 29:21.926
and that you love her
and that you'll call her from Cuba.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.851
All right, I'll be right back.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.849
-What happened?
-It was voicemail. I hung up.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.809
You'll keep trying, right?

30:11.894 --> 30:12.894
Yeah.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.313
You did good.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.488
I already know what he'll say.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.490
So do I. I've spoken to him.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.034
-He denied it?
-Yeah.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.411
What did he say happened?

30:31.914 --> 30:33.414
You don't want to hear it.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.750
-Yes, I do.
-It's upsetting.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.419
I have a new standard for what upsets me.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.421
-He said it was consensual?
-Yeah.

30:40.506 --> 30:44.550
How can it be consensual if one of
the consenting parties isn't conscious?

30:44.635 --> 30:47.261
-It can't be.
-So what did he say?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.764
Mary, he says you said,
"Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.516
"Get two guys in here who will fuck me."

30:51.600 --> 30:52.934
Yeah, that...

30:53.018 --> 30:54.727
That sounds like me.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.687
And he's changing his story a little.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.272
That's something
that would come out in a trial.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.524
There's not gonna be a trial.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.818
There's not gonna be an arrest.
And there's not gonna be an investigation.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.947
Mine's gonna be
one of the 700,000 untested rape kits,

31:06.031 --> 31:07.949
so I started this website.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.953
-Do you know who Sloan Sabbith is?
-Sure.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.038
-She's my girlfriend.
-Well done.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.415
About, I don't know, a year and a half ago,

31:16.500 --> 31:19.919
she was dating this guy
and they broke up and he was pissed.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.879
She'd posed for him, some naked pictures,

31:21.964 --> 31:24.048
and he posted them
on a site called RevengePorn.com.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.342
I remember. What did she do?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.261
She broke his jaw,
but I'm not recommending that.

31:28.345 --> 31:31.055
This isn't revenge. It's a warning.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.975
It's a public service.
Do not go on a date with these guys.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.810
Do not go to a party with these guys.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.603
Do not give these guys a job, ever.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.564
Wait, they're avoiding jail and you
think I'm being too harsh?

31:39.648 --> 31:42.775
Don't you think there's a chance that
somebody's gonna use the site as revenge?

31:42.859 --> 31:45.236
That somebody's gonna
make up a story and ruin a kid's life?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.572
Jeff got into Stanford Medical School.
Not anymore.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.907
There were NFL teams looking at Brandon.
Not anymore.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.576
Yeah, you can imagine
how sad that makes me.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.370
Don't you think there's a chance that
somebody, a woman who feels rejected...

31:54.454 --> 31:55.705
Yeah, bitches be bitches. I get it.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.456
I'm just saying that if a grown man

31:57.541 --> 32:00.167
who works in arbitrage
at one of the biggest banks in the world

32:00.252 --> 32:02.753
can post naked pictures
of his ex on RevengePorn.com...

32:02.838 --> 32:06.173
Yes, I think there's a chance
and I've weighed the cost benefit.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.468
I have. If another girl got raped
because I didn't say anything

32:09.553 --> 32:11.554
or because someone else
didn't say anything...

32:11.638 --> 32:13.514
-I know.
-You don't know.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.890
And you're right about that, too.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.642
Then what am I wrong about?

32:20.647 --> 32:24.025
What am I wrong about?

32:25.485 --> 32:28.279
I don't like Jews. I said it.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.615
People are afraid
to speak their mind these days.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.617
I haven't noticed that.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.787
First of all, we've got, what, 3%?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.415
Is that how many Jews there are,
3% of America?

32:39.499 --> 32:40.541
A little less.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.960
Less than 3% of Americans

32:43.045 --> 32:45.630
controlling the banks, the media, Hollywood.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.840
They didn't take
those things in an armed assault.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.675
That's exactly how they did it.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.595
Their grandparents came here
from the Polish ghettos

32:52.679 --> 32:55.056
and the Russian villages
and they told their sons,

32:55.140 --> 32:56.682
"Don't work with your hands."

32:56.767 --> 33:00.186
Go to law school. You go to medical school.
You go to business school.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.314
You don't get calluses on your hands.
You wear a suit to work.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.232
Given the time they came from
and the one that was coming,

33:05.317 --> 33:06.317
it was pretty good advice.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.736
And guys like you worship them.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.447
You'd give anything to be Jewish.
You're Protestant, right?

33:11.531 --> 33:14.158
-Catholic.
-Nah, not on both sides.

33:14.242 --> 33:16.911
-My mother was Catholic.
-So is my wife.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.373
-Is that why you hit her?
-No, I'm not prejudiced.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.249
You assume I am 'cause I do real work.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.919
- What do I do?
- Please, buddy.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.004
-You want to trade jobs with me?
-No.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.881
'Cause you're too smart for what I do.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.257
Just like the Jews.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.219
That's why your father drank.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.349
I'm making an executive decision.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.975
Should I quiet everyone down?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.019
We can't be in this line because A, you know,

33:42.104 --> 33:44.230
and B, he'll have already talked
to everyone who's boarded.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.399
We need to be on the plane early.
Let's go back to the first plan.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.359
No reporter is gonna sell us their ticket.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.569
There are people
on this flight who aren't reporters.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.196
Let's look around and identify them.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.786
Those two are on their honeymoon.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.837
I do, just a little. My husband does not.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.339
I'm Maggie Jordan and this is Jim Harper.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.633
We are from an American news agency.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.051
Atlantis Cable News.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.853
He says Atlantis is a lost...

34:24.855 --> 34:26.355
Hercules, Zeus.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.774
-Mythological.
-Mythological city.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.651
It is, but the news agency is real.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.902
-Go faster.
-Shut up.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.738
Are you on your honeymoon, too?

34:33.822 --> 34:38.284
No, we're reporting an important story
and we need to get on that flight.

34:38.368 --> 34:40.661
And we'd like to buy your tickets to Havana

34:40.746 --> 34:43.664
and give you two free tickets to Madrid.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.876
-Tell them Madrid's closer.
-They know where Madrid is.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.086
-Just remind them.
-We know where Madrid is.

34:49.171 --> 34:51.297
--He wants your watch.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.048
He wants your watch.

34:53.133 --> 34:56.260
This watch was
a graduation present from my parents.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.471
Could I write you a check
for some money instead?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.933
We'll take the money, too.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.273
He liked my shirt and my pants, too.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.776
And everything that was
in my suitcase and my suitcase.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.527
Hey, she took my News Night baseball cap.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.654
- I think we have more of those.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.448
These are our seats.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.205
All right.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.207
We'll see him come on from here.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.418
I look like an idiot.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.295
You look kind of cute.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.799
I look like I

35:34.883 --> 35:37.927
just really, really, really like the Olympics.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.644
You never called Hallie, did you?

35:47.646 --> 35:48.813
No.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.440
Jesus Christ, Jim.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.986
The law is plainly failing rape victims.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.738
That must be obvious to you.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.491
It is, but in fairness,
the law wasn't built to serve victims.

36:00.575 --> 36:01.659
In fairness?

36:01.743 --> 36:03.077
I know.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.164
Do you believe me?

36:08.250 --> 36:10.000
Do I believe you? Of course I do.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.169
-Seriously.
-I'm not here on a fact-finding mission.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.547
I'm just curious. Be really honest.

36:14.631 --> 36:15.631
Okay.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.260
I've heard two competing stories.

36:19.344 --> 36:23.055
One from a very credible woman,
who as far as I can see has no reason to lie.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.349
The other from
a guy I judge to be a little sketchy

36:25.433 --> 36:27.476
who has every reason to lie and I am...

36:27.561 --> 36:29.603
I'm obligated to believe the sketchy guy.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.398
This isn't a courtroom.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.025
You're not legally obligated
to presume innocence.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.278
-I believe I'm morally obligated.
-You know, you're a good guy,

36:37.362 --> 36:39.572
but do people tell you a lot
that your head's up your ass?

36:39.656 --> 36:42.950
They do, and I absolutely
allow for that possibility.

36:43.034 --> 36:47.371
I'm the guy who goes around saying
OJ's not guilty because a jury said so.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.540
I'm not gonna get a jury.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.333
I know, and I can imagine how frustrating...

36:51.418 --> 36:53.294
No, you can't imagine.

36:54.629 --> 36:55.963
No, I can't.

36:56.756 --> 37:00.718
But it is a huge, dangerous,

37:00.802 --> 37:04.221
scary-as-shit mistake
to convene your own trial

37:04.306 --> 37:06.974
in front of a television audience
where there's no due process,

37:07.058 --> 37:10.144
no lawyers, no discovery,
no rules of procedure,

37:10.228 --> 37:13.522
no decisions on admissible evidence,
threat of perjury,

37:13.607 --> 37:15.733
confrontation of witnesses
or any of the things we do...

37:15.817 --> 37:18.068
To ensure that rapists go
to Stanford Medical School.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.696
To ensure an innocent person isn't destroyed.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.907
The law can acquit. The Internet never will.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.743
The Internet is used for vigilantism every day.

37:25.827 --> 37:29.079
But this is a whole new level
and if we go there, we're truly fucked.

37:29.164 --> 37:32.166
-I'm not a vigilante.
-Do you want to live in a world where...

37:32.250 --> 37:34.251
Do you want to hear the advice I get?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.254
I mean, this is real advice.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.298
In pamphlets.

37:39.799 --> 37:43.594
Say you have a boyfriend.
Wear a wedding ring.

37:43.678 --> 37:47.181
I'm supposed to protect myself from a man

37:47.265 --> 37:50.434
by pretending
I'm the property of another man.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.228
And, of course,
there's no shortage of good fashion advice.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.772
-Mary.
-When you came in here,

37:54.856 --> 37:58.692
you wanted to go to a public place
because you were scared I'd cry rape.

38:00.737 --> 38:02.696
I'm scared of getting raped.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.241
I'm scared all the time.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.703
All the time.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.873
So you know what my site does?

38:14.084 --> 38:16.293
It scares you.

38:16.378 --> 38:19.254
It scares the living shit out of any guy

38:19.339 --> 38:24.343
who thinks even once about putting
his hands on someone without an invitation.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.388
- You're right to name your attacker.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.100
You may even be obligated to.

38:34.396 --> 38:37.147
But the site is gonna
clobber an innocent person

38:37.232 --> 38:38.857
and there is no chance that it won't.

38:38.942 --> 38:42.695
And if you face off
with the guy you've accused on TV,

38:42.779 --> 38:44.947
it is going to be a lawless food fight

38:45.031 --> 38:47.449
with irreversible, irretrievable consequences.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.828
Teams will be formed,
you will be slut-shamed,

38:50.912 --> 38:54.331
and you won't get
the justice you're looking for.

38:54.416 --> 38:56.417
That's why I'm asking you to refuse.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.337
I don't understand
why you need me to refuse.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.631
It's your show. Why don't you just not do it?

39:02.716 --> 39:03.841
I've been overruled.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.011
It's a promotable story
that'll bring in a younger audience.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.554
I don't have a problem with that.

39:08.638 --> 39:10.264
It's sports, Mary.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.683
It'll be covered like sports.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.936
I'm gonna win this time.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.027
All right.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.488
Thanks for hearing me out.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.576
We'll be in touch with you.

39:39.794 --> 39:40.794
<i>You miss your wife?</i>

39:41.838 --> 39:42.838
Yes.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.382
Uh, yes. Yes, Mr. Chairman.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.092
I miss my wife. That's affirmative.

39:47.177 --> 39:50.054
I was married to her for 11 minutes
before I was taken to jail.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.430
Yes, I miss my wife.

39:52.766 --> 39:56.185
So is she like you or is she like,
I don't know, what do you call it?

39:56.269 --> 39:58.437
-I don't know what you're asking.
-A trophy wife.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.898
A guy like you could get, you know.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.775
Is she a trophy wife or is she smart?

40:02.859 --> 40:04.359
She's very smart.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.988
Is that something you're saying
because people say that?

40:08.073 --> 40:10.449
She went to school at Cambridge in England.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.077
She's considered
one of the best in the world at her job...

40:13.161 --> 40:15.871
-You've got to stop being a prick.
-What did I do now?

40:15.955 --> 40:18.624
I know that Cambridge
is in goddamn England, shithead.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.918
Why is the first thing you tell me is
where she went to school?

40:21.002 --> 40:23.879
My wife is smarter than I am
in every way imaginable

40:23.963 --> 40:25.422
and it never makes me mad.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.092
I don't feel a crippling inferiority complex

40:28.176 --> 40:30.344
turn into rage and bad decisions

40:30.428 --> 40:32.137
when I think about her being smart.

40:32.222 --> 40:35.140
-You're saying I do?
-It seems to come up a lot.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.642
I don't like media types.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.435
-East Coast elites.
-Yeah.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.646
That's a thoroughly original opinion.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.523
I've never heard that before.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.693
See, you people think
we can't recognize sarcasm.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.279
We can. We just call it being an asshole.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.948
And we call you a shit kicker.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.242
And you still don't think
you look down at some people.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.910
Down is where some people are.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.370
Hmm.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.334
What's your mission to civilize?

41:04.420 --> 41:05.420
Who told you about that?

41:05.505 --> 41:06.797
-You did.
-When?

41:06.881 --> 41:09.466
-A while ago.
-I don't remember that.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.510
Mission to civilize, what is that?

41:12.178 --> 41:13.178
Nothing.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.471
It's not nothing.

41:14.556 --> 41:15.931
-It's just a joke.
-No, it's not.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.432
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.854
It's a reference to Don Quixote.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.939
-The knight?
-He wasn't a real knight.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.233
He was an old man who was delusional.
He thought he was a knight.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.486
He took on a world
that was bleak and morally corrupt.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.031
How'd he do?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.075
He got his ass kicked.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.663
See? And that's the thing.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.875
I don't want to see you get your ass kicked.

41:46.963 --> 41:50.757
That's... That's not true. That was dishonest.

41:50.842 --> 41:54.261
I badly want to see you get your ass kicked.

41:55.305 --> 41:56.847
I know.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.643
And that picture of you and your father,

42:01.728 --> 42:04.897
I'll bet he wasn't trying
to teach you about civic morality.

42:05.773 --> 42:09.443
I'll bet he was just trying to teach you to fish.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.035
Please, you have to take your seats now.

42:18.119 --> 42:22.456
We're pushing back from the gate and
all passengers must take their seats, please.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.874
Thank you.

42:26.294 --> 42:28.503
We had seats across the aisle from him.

42:28.588 --> 42:32.799
The honeymooners had two seats
across the aisle from Edward Snowden.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.719
Boris and Natasha had the golden tickets.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.971
We'd have had him the whole flight
except for one thing.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.390
-He's not...
-He's not on the plane. You know where he is?

42:40.475 --> 42:43.060
-Probably back in the airport.
-Yeah.

42:43.144 --> 42:46.897
So we'll be flying 600 miles an hour
away from the story.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.650
- Fuck!

42:54.280 --> 42:56.573
Why didn't you call her?

42:56.658 --> 42:57.824
What?

42:58.451 --> 43:00.619
Why didn't you call Hallie?

43:00.703 --> 43:02.412
You're a noodge, Maggie. You know that?

43:02.497 --> 43:03.997
I'm just asking.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.001
If you really like her, it's a stupid thing...

43:08.086 --> 43:09.586
I like you.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.132
And I don't really know
why you don't know that.

43:20.223 --> 43:21.723
Because...

43:21.808 --> 43:24.810
Because if you wanted to be with me,
you'd be with me.

43:24.894 --> 43:27.354
That's just not at all true.

43:27.438 --> 43:29.022
You were with Don when I met you.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.942
You never called me from New Hampshire.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.987
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't. Ever.

43:35.071 --> 43:38.407
And you knew I had split up with Don
and you knew why.

43:38.491 --> 43:40.325
You went through Lisa,
you went through Hallie.

43:40.410 --> 43:42.786
And you never called me
from New Hampshire.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.871
So it's really not as obvious as you think it is.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.456
And it's also probably not true.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.875
Well, the rest might be right...

43:50.378 --> 43:52.713
It's not, but it had potential...

43:52.797 --> 43:55.757
But the last thing was unambiguously wrong.

43:55.842 --> 43:58.343
-What language are you...
-I do like you.

43:59.679 --> 44:02.014
I like you and I'm glad I said it.

44:02.807 --> 44:07.561
Even though now I wish I had said it
at the end of a 13-hour flight.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.817
Yeah, this is gonna be uncomfortable.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.152
I'm gonna switch seats with someone.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.821
I'll switch seats. I'll sit in Snowden's seat.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.241
That's not far enough.
It's gonna be weird if we can see each other.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.498
Okay.

44:51.814 --> 44:55.400
I'm making a motion that the court
vacate its initial contempt finding

44:55.485 --> 44:56.818
because enough is enough.

44:57.445 --> 44:58.862
Do I need grounds? Sure.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.447
The government now possesses information

45:00.531 --> 45:02.699
that will help it independently find the source.

45:02.784 --> 45:04.534
But mostly, enough is enough.

45:04.619 --> 45:06.536
You can't lock up a man for 52 days

45:06.621 --> 45:08.914
without him knowing when
or even if he's ever getting out.

45:08.998 --> 45:12.376
You can't lock up a reporter
for protecting his source.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.252
-You can't have everything. And you...
-Rebecca.

45:14.337 --> 45:15.712
I have not yielded the floor.

45:15.797 --> 45:17.631
I won't be contesting your motion.

45:18.466 --> 45:19.841
I'm sorry?

45:20.176 --> 45:23.512
I won't be contesting your motion.
I'll be joining it.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.723
This isn't supposed to be punitive.
It's supposed to be coercive.

45:26.808 --> 45:29.309
And plainly he's not giving up the name.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.728
He'll sleep at home tonight.

45:43.533 --> 45:48.912
Follow me.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.707
Where are we going?

45:52.792 --> 45:54.835
Exactly where you think we're going.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.087
I don't know what... I'm confused.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.756
We're running into turbulence.

45:59.841 --> 46:02.926
You have to go to your seats
and put your seat belts on.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.553
This is awkward.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.222
I was sitting far away from you.
I was watching episode four.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.349
I'm sorry, would you mind trading back?

46:09.434 --> 46:11.268
We're in the middle of turbulence.

46:11.352 --> 46:15.355
It's nothing. It's due to the action
of molecular viscosity called laminar flow.

46:17.066 --> 46:18.400
Okay.

46:19.819 --> 46:22.696
-Where did that come from?
-Sit down. Put on your seat belt.

46:58.858 --> 47:01.651
And we're joined now by Bree Dorrit,
editor of ACN Digital

47:01.736 --> 47:03.445
and father of the ACNgage app.

47:03.529 --> 47:04.946
-Thanks for joining us, Bree.
-Hi, Sloan.

47:05.031 --> 47:08.366
<i>We saw some of it in the package</i>
<i>we just played, but tell us about ACNgage.</i>

47:08.451 --> 47:09.993
<i>It's a map that tells you where celebrities</i>

47:10.077 --> 47:11.828
<i>have been sighted</i>
<i>in New York or Los Angeles.</i>

47:11.913 --> 47:14.206
<i>And soon we'll be</i>
<i>expanding to Vegas and South Beach.</i>

47:14.290 --> 47:17.042
Any time you want, you can scroll
around and see, you know,

47:17.126 --> 47:19.878
Jude Law was shopping for condoms at
Duane Reade on 57th or...

47:19.962 --> 47:23.215
So people are out there and
they can post a message to us and say,

47:23.299 --> 47:25.675
"Kristen Bell and her kid
are at the 4:00 p.m. showing

47:25.760 --> 47:27.511
<i>"of How to Train Your Dragon</i>
at the ArcLight?"

47:27.595 --> 47:29.012
<i>And it goes right on our map,</i>
<i>instantly.</i>

47:29.096 --> 47:31.014
<i>So that when Kristen Bell</i>
<i>and her kid come out of the movies,</i>

47:31.098 --> 47:33.058
there are a dozen sociopaths
waiting for them?

47:35.770 --> 47:37.062
I don't think that's likely.

47:37.146 --> 47:38.688
Why not?

47:38.773 --> 47:41.066
Well, it's the price of fame, isn't it?

47:41.150 --> 47:43.193
<i>No, it's not. It's a punishment for it.</i>

47:43.277 --> 47:45.695
<i>Celebrities have been stalked</i>
<i>and celebrities have been murdered.</i>

47:45.780 --> 47:47.864
What this app is best at
is assisting in that, right?

47:48.491 --> 47:51.326
I'm sorry you feel that way.
ACNgage is citizen journalism.

47:51.786 --> 47:53.370
Can you talk about the vetting process

47:53.454 --> 47:55.539
-the citizen journalism undergoes?
-The vetting?

47:55.623 --> 47:57.374
<i>People can post more than locations.</i>

47:57.458 --> 47:59.292
<i>-They can post observations.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

47:59.377 --> 48:01.711
<i>I'm asking if those posts</i>
<i>are fact-checked.</i>

48:01.796 --> 48:03.838
<i>This is one specific element of the site...</i>

48:03.923 --> 48:06.091
<i>For instance, in a post today</i>
<i>a citizen journalist tells us</i>

48:06.175 --> 48:08.426
that Jimmy Kimmel
was visibly intoxicated last night

48:08.511 --> 48:10.053
at the Soho House in West Hollywood.

48:10.137 --> 48:11.137
That's right.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.765
Jimmy Kimmel was with his family
in Cabo San Lucas last night.

48:14.475 --> 48:15.517
Uh...

48:15.601 --> 48:18.311
People don't read this
with the expectation of it being true.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.063
-Everyone...
-Excuse me?

48:20.147 --> 48:21.565
-Everyone...
-People don't have an expectation

48:21.649 --> 48:23.024
that what they're reading is true?

48:23.109 --> 48:24.776
<i>They read it for the immediacy.</i>

48:24.860 --> 48:26.611
<i>But you're using the word journalism,</i>

48:26.696 --> 48:29.239
which means there is an expectation
that what they're reading is true.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.741
But let me take it a step further.
Let's pretend it was true

48:31.826 --> 48:35.662
<i>that Jimmy Kimmel was intoxicated last night</i>
<i>at the Soho House in West Hollywood.</i>

48:35.746 --> 48:37.581
<i>It's not true, but we don't care,</i>
<i>so let's pretend that it is</i>

48:37.665 --> 48:38.999
<i>since that's what we're doing anyway.</i>

48:39.083 --> 48:40.500
<i>Why does that belong on our website?</i>

48:40.585 --> 48:42.252
Leave her on as long as she wants.

48:42.336 --> 48:46.423
Honestly, I think there's a shifting definition
of what's public and private space.

48:46.507 --> 48:47.882
There is, and we should care about that.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.092
But my question is

48:49.176 --> 48:52.262
why should we care about
a talk show host drinking at a bar?

48:52.346 --> 48:55.265
Don't you think it's great that we're
not putting people up on a pedestal

48:55.349 --> 48:56.766
and worshiping them anymore?

48:56.851 --> 49:00.145
I don't think celebrities are
one of the bigger problems facing us,

49:00.229 --> 49:02.355
but aren't we the ones building the pedestal?

49:02.440 --> 49:04.107
You've got a map that gives us their location.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.693
The idea is that we're
acknowledging that they're real people.

49:06.777 --> 49:08.862
I wonder how many of us
didn't already know that.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.780
But you're doing more than
acknowledging they're real people.

49:10.865 --> 49:11.865
You're beating them up for it.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.410
Aren't they protected by the piles of
money they're surrounded by?

49:15.494 --> 49:17.621
Okay, what's the line of demarcation?

49:17.705 --> 49:19.289
You make over X dollars a year

49:19.373 --> 49:21.625
and now you get to be treated by us
as a regular person

49:21.709 --> 49:24.127
who's basically had an electronic bracelet
slapped on their ankle.

49:24.211 --> 49:25.378
What does X equal?

49:25.463 --> 49:27.756
It would be silly to name
an exact dollar amount.

49:27.840 --> 49:29.382
You're paid $55,000 a year.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.884
Well, that's private.

49:30.968 --> 49:34.429
Sorry. That's almost twice the
national average for a family of four.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.598
Do your piles of cash protect
you from this interview

49:36.682 --> 49:39.142
in which I'm intentionally
stripping you of your dignity?

49:39.226 --> 49:42.103
And, by the way,
I've managed to do it without lying once.

49:42.188 --> 49:44.481
So I'm going to give you another
chance to answer my question

49:44.565 --> 49:46.232
before I answer it myself.

49:46.317 --> 49:48.485
What's the value of an unsourced,
unvetted story

49:48.569 --> 49:51.404
about a grown man drinking at a bar?

49:56.994 --> 49:59.663
I can't give you all the time in the world.
It's entertainment.

49:59.747 --> 50:01.206
My concern isn't for the celebrities,

50:01.290 --> 50:04.459
even though as sure as we're sitting here,
someone's gonna get hurt.

50:04.543 --> 50:05.627
My concern is for the rest of us,

50:05.711 --> 50:08.546
who you're turning into
a wild pack of pride-less punks.

50:10.091 --> 50:11.675
That's News Night for June 24th.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.760
I'm Sloan Sabbith filling in for Will McAvoy.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.304
<i>Terry Smith's up next</i>
with The Capitol Report.

50:20.226 --> 50:21.434
We're clear.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.105
Pruit's gonna kill you for this.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.856
I know.

50:32.071 --> 50:34.656
-Did you put her up to that?
-Let's go in my office.

50:34.740 --> 50:37.784
-No! We'll go where I fucking say we go!
-Charlie.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.203
-Did you put her up to it?
-Nobody put me up to anything.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.871
What did you think you were doing?

50:41.956 --> 50:44.332
-You saw the questions she was gonna ask?
-'Course I saw the questions.

50:44.417 --> 50:45.417
I was doing the interview the only way

50:45.501 --> 50:47.252
-that made sense to me.
-You were openly insubordinate!

50:47.336 --> 50:49.045
I was told to do this interview.

50:49.130 --> 50:50.547
You knew what I was looking for!

50:50.631 --> 50:52.549
I did and I didn't like it, but I did it anyway.

50:52.633 --> 50:55.218
-That was my interview.
-I tried to do the best I could, but I didn't...

50:55.302 --> 50:56.803
I'm tired of this.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.471
Did you get the Princeton kid?

50:58.848 --> 51:01.141
Charlie, let's go into my office
and sit down for a minute.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.892
Did you get the Princeton kid?

51:05.688 --> 51:07.689
-No.
-Why not?

51:09.358 --> 51:10.525
Couldn't find her.

51:12.153 --> 51:13.319
You couldn't...

51:14.864 --> 51:15.905
No.

51:15.990 --> 51:18.908
-You couldn't find her?
-No.

51:18.993 --> 51:20.910
Is this a mutiny?

51:20.995 --> 51:22.370
It's an intervention.

51:22.455 --> 51:24.914
I'm trying to keep this together!

51:24.999 --> 51:27.500
Her and her, tell 'em to pack their shit
and get out of here.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.669
-I apologize for the interview.
-I don't.

51:29.754 --> 51:31.755
-Pack up your shit and get out of here, lady.
-Look...

51:31.839 --> 51:34.591
She tore apart our network,
except it isn't ours, it's mine.

51:34.675 --> 51:37.427
So either Thelma and Louise
vacate the premises in the next five minutes

51:37.511 --> 51:40.930
or I will fire
the motherfucking lot of you right now.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.308
No, you won't. 'Cause you can't.

51:43.392 --> 51:44.768
Only I can.

51:44.852 --> 51:47.437
A parting gift from Mrs. Lansing.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.690
Who on her worst day would never...

51:53.819 --> 51:55.945
We need to talk.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.822
You and me, right now, okay?

51:59.366 --> 52:00.867
Upstairs.

52:01.368 --> 52:02.577
Nobody leaves the premises

52:02.661 --> 52:05.663
until we figure out
how to fix this fucking calamity.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.001
I'll be back in a minute.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.756
-Let's meet in my office.
-I'm there.

54:20.174 --> 54:22.342
It's okay. It's over.

54:29.850 --> 54:32.518
Charlie had a heart attack a few hours ago.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.565
He died.
