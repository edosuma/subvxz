DOCTOR: (ON TV)
<i>Like any organ does</i>
<i>as we grow older,</i>

00:32.631 --> 00:35.833
<i>the eye deteriorates and decays.</i>

00:35.835 --> 00:41.138
<i>Whether it be</i>
<i>genetic predisposition</i>
<i>or environmental factors,</i>

00:41.140 --> 00:44.909
<i>we are subject to
losing the gift of sight,</i>

00:44.911 --> 00:49.580
<i>clouding the windows
to our souls, if you will.</i>

00:49.849 --> 00:53.184
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that cataracts</i>
<i>are now responsible</i>

00:53.186 --> 00:56.754
<i>for 48% of world blindness?</i>

00:56.756 --> 00:57.054
(SIGHS)

00:57.056 --> 01:00.825
<i>Though aging is</i>
<i>the primary cause,</i>
<i>there are a wide variety...</i>

01:00.827 --> 01:04.295
Devon, you're just going to
grade papers the whole time?

01:04.297 --> 01:06.998
What? This is my lunch break.

01:07.433 --> 01:10.167
What do you want me
to do, pray for you?

01:10.370 --> 01:11.435
Your eye is fine, okay?

01:11.437 --> 01:15.973
Just like your teeth
aren't getting looser,
and you didn't have foot rot.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.508
Knock on wood.

01:18.678 --> 01:19.710
Oh, okay.

01:19.712 --> 01:22.813
I got to get the rest
of these papers to my TA.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.316
But, I love you.

01:25.551 --> 01:26.784
You're okay.

01:26.786 --> 01:27.718
Love you.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.552
Say hi to the doc for me.

01:28.554 --> 01:32.223
See you after work,
assuming I can still see.

01:35.161 --> 01:39.297
<i>...to
irreversible loss of vision.</i>

01:39.832 --> 01:41.232
NURSE: Quinn.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.936
(PHONE RINGING)

01:46.472 --> 01:47.405
Hey there, pal.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.807
- Hi, Dad.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:50.009 --> 01:52.310
So, what is it this time?
A little redness?

01:52.312 --> 01:56.280
Yeah, just in the left eye.
A little dot's been
there for about a week.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.748
Okay.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.951
Let's go.
Let's just lean forward.

02:01.354 --> 02:04.922
Place your chin on
the plastic piece there

02:05.291 --> 02:08.526
and look
directly into the light.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.860
Right here.

02:11.898 --> 02:13.197
Good.

02:13.199 --> 02:14.865
Oh, by the way,
your mother made some of that

02:14.867 --> 02:18.135
egg salad that
you love, you know,
with the tarragon,

02:18.137 --> 02:19.804
I brought some in for you.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.938
Thanks.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.807
Well, what do you know,

02:22.975 --> 02:23.941
pingueculitis.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.677
It's an irritation
or a thinning of the
conjunctiva.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.813
It's usually found
in elderly people,

02:28.815 --> 02:32.049
Latinos,
people who work outdoors.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.385
You the outdoorsy type now?

02:34.387 --> 02:37.088
I'd go with Latino
before outdoorsy.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.358
It could also have something
to do with your nose.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.525
What's wrong with my nose?

02:41.527 --> 02:43.928
Nothing.
It's a beautiful nose,
you got the Berman nose.

02:43.930 --> 02:48.065
Only it's,
slightly more pronounced
than other noses might be.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.369
How does my nose
size contribute to this?

02:51.371 --> 02:53.537
It's acting as a, kind of,

02:53.539 --> 02:55.973
large reflector, if you will.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.276
So my nose is so large that,

02:59.278 --> 03:02.613
what, the reflection
is burning a hole in my eye?

03:02.615 --> 03:04.982
No, no, no, no, no.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.450
Just the lining of it.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.420
The treatment is
artificial tears

03:09.422 --> 03:11.555
and UV-protection sunglasses.

03:11.557 --> 03:14.191
You're getting
older there, my boy.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.026
Twenty-eight's not old.

03:16.095 --> 03:16.427
Yeah.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.497
It's not really the age
where it makes any sense.

03:19.565 --> 03:20.698
Nor the race.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.201
All right,
I'll get your UV sunglasses.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.537
The ladies are gonna love you.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.473
Dad, I have
a girlfriend for 10 years.

03:29.475 --> 03:33.043
Kidding, I love Devon.
When are you gonna propose?

03:33.045 --> 03:34.178
I was about to.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.080
I have Mama's ring.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.615
But now, with this illness...

03:37.617 --> 03:39.683
It's not an illness.

03:39.685 --> 03:40.584
It's a condition.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.554
It's treatable.
Marriage, I mean.

03:43.923 --> 03:47.758
How many times a day
do I have to put in
the artificial tears?

03:47.760 --> 03:48.426
Six to eight.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.728
Or I could just
insert some punctal plugs.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.464
- Insert where?
- In your punctum.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.698
In my what?

03:54.700 --> 03:55.399
Tear ducts.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.568
Little, tiny, umbrella-shaped,
silicon plugs

03:57.570 --> 04:01.539
that block out
the drainage of tears,
thus, irrigating the eye.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.139
I'm a little...

04:02.141 --> 04:04.408
Sit, sit.
Come on, sit down, sit down.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.411
That's it. Put your
head between your legs.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.780
Your grandmother used to say...

04:11.918 --> 04:15.586
That means,
"You only get one
first marriage."

04:15.588 --> 04:17.087
That's inspiring.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.422
Look...

04:19.559 --> 04:20.724
If Devon is the one,

04:20.726 --> 04:23.427
unless there's a piece
of coal in that ring,
instead of a diamond,

04:23.429 --> 04:27.331
your sitting on it longer,
isn't doing you any good.

04:27.967 --> 04:30.434
You saw the people
in the waiting room.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.671
They were all you, yesterday.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.911
Dev.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.245
What?

06:55.247 --> 06:57.681
Aren't you
supposed to be at work?

06:57.783 --> 07:01.552
Impersonating late Miles Davis?

07:01.554 --> 07:02.419
What happened?

07:02.421 --> 07:04.922
No, nothing.
I wanted sir to prize...

07:04.924 --> 07:08.592
To precise...
I wanted to surprise you.

07:10.463 --> 07:10.861
Okay.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.063
Wait, what did he
say about your eye?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.665
Oh, no, it's fine.

07:14.667 --> 07:19.503
Actually, it put
everything into perspective.

07:19.505 --> 07:23.440
That well, I'm finally...

07:23.442 --> 07:28.045
You know...
And I love you more than...

07:28.347 --> 07:29.313
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:29.315 --> 07:32.516
Okay, I love you too.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.852
But, you're scaring me.

07:34.854 --> 07:38.589
So, there's nothing
wrong with your eye?

07:38.591 --> 07:39.456
Yes, there's... No...

07:39.458 --> 07:42.126
Yes, there's...
It's pingueculitis.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.829
It's not a big deal, I'm just
supposed to wear
those glasses but...

07:45.831 --> 07:49.299
Well, you know,
I do know how
seriously you take fashion.

07:49.301 --> 07:52.503
Yeah, says the girl
who only wears clogs.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.370
What? They're comfortable.

07:53.372 --> 07:56.807
Yeah, well, that doesn't make
them not clogs.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.043
Very cloggy.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.049
What?

08:05.251 --> 08:08.285
You're just my favorite.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.122
Well, you're up there
for me too.

08:12.525 --> 08:15.292
Well...

08:16.195 --> 08:18.562
The day has come...

08:19.098 --> 08:22.366
Oh, my God.
You got a gig playing piano.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.835
- I...
- No, no, no.

08:24.837 --> 08:28.105
But didn't you
send in your demo tape
to the Thai restaurant?

08:28.107 --> 08:30.274
No one wants to hear live jazz

08:30.276 --> 08:32.976
while they're eating mee krob,
it's too much.

08:32.977 --> 08:38.048
Come on, at some point
you're gonna have to
play in front of people.

08:38.317 --> 08:42.419
- Anyway I just wanted to...
- (BELL RINGS)

08:42.421 --> 08:44.254
I have to go.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.456
You have class.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.492
-Thank you so much
for surprising me.
-Okay. Okay.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.460
I'm gonna call you
on the way home.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.596
I'm sorry. I'm just supposed
to be giving
a lecture on Flaubert.

08:52.598 --> 08:56.033
You don't have to lecture them
about Flaubert.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.267
Just say it nicely.

08:57.269 --> 08:59.937
- All right. Love you.
- Love you.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.851
It's just this eye condition.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.953
Ping... Wait, what?

09:15.955 --> 09:17.688
Pingueculitis.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.491
Is it... Is it contagious?

09:20.493 --> 09:22.192
No.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.629
What are we doing
with the rose petals,
did I miss an order?

09:25.631 --> 09:27.898
I'm... Uh, I'm...

09:28.534 --> 09:29.867
Okay, don't say
anything, Kelsey.

09:29.869 --> 09:33.270
But, I'm gonna ask
Devon to marry me.

09:34.573 --> 09:34.872
Wow.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.508
You know,
I used to propose to girls
in elementary school.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.845
I mean, I was in
elementary school too.
It wasn't just illegal.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.984
Yay! Yay! (CHUCKLES)

09:47.253 --> 09:49.286
Yeah. Thanks.

09:52.324 --> 09:55.092
I mean, of course.
I called it in high school.

09:55.094 --> 09:59.563
You did, yeah? What about you?
You're still with...

09:59.565 --> 10:00.565
We broke up.

10:00.566 --> 10:01.732
The basketball player.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.001
- We broke up too.
- Oh.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.669
But, there's a new guy,

10:05.671 --> 10:08.272
Isaac,
you'll meet him tonight.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.706
We are having pizza
before Jameson's, right?

10:09.708 --> 10:11.775
-Yes, yeah.
And you're bringing...
-Isaac.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.876
- Isaac.
- Yeah, the mechanic.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.945
Cool. Well, if it doesn't
work out with him

10:14.947 --> 10:16.880
I have a great mechanic.

10:17.716 --> 10:19.449
- Thanks.
- Yay.

10:25.991 --> 10:28.792
Can I talk to you for a second?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.194
Sure.

10:30.196 --> 10:33.230
I think I might be
in love with you.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.399
A little.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.734
With me?

10:38.637 --> 10:40.737
No, you're right. Never mind.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.439
No. Wait.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.774
- What?
- I mean...

10:43.776 --> 10:46.710
Obviously, I don't want to
ruin what we have here.

10:46.712 --> 10:47.678
And, I love Devon.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.446
She always buys
me lottery tickets
on my birthday

10:49.448 --> 10:51.448
'cause she know how
much I want to win.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.917
But, it just hit me,

10:53.919 --> 10:55.552
that all these guys,

10:55.554 --> 10:58.655
I mean,
they don't challenge me.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.457
And you...

11:00.459 --> 11:03.393
You make me feel like a lady.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.863
And you listen.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.632
And you make eye contact.

11:09.401 --> 11:14.204
Are you really gonna
marry the first girl
you've ever been with?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.544
Well...

11:20.880 --> 11:22.112
One girl

11:22.114 --> 11:24.581
in your entire life.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.554
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have told you.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.155
Yes, you should have.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.090
But you can do better.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.258
Look at you,
you're like a model.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.295
I mean, when we hug,
I look like a skin
tag hanging off of you.

11:38.297 --> 11:39.529
Eww!

11:41.200 --> 11:43.166
Come on, you're a man.

11:43.168 --> 11:46.937
A man, what lead
you to believe that?

11:49.141 --> 11:50.274
Sorry.

11:50.276 --> 11:53.710
I can get
a little rough sometimes.

11:55.347 --> 11:57.014
Sure.

11:57.349 --> 11:58.649
Me too.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.251
I'll see you tonight.

12:01.253 --> 12:05.289
Right. Tonight, yeah.
I'll see you tonight.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.560
- KELSEY: Oh, this one?
- Yeah, that one.

12:11.096 --> 12:13.463
Yeah, thanks.
This is lucky seven.

12:13.465 --> 12:18.268
My mom got it for me,
'cause in my family
this is like...

12:19.305 --> 12:22.839
So, what does
the tattoo on your neck say?

12:23.442 --> 12:25.575
<i>"Veni, vidi, vici."</i>

12:25.577 --> 12:28.578
"I came, I saw, I conquered."

12:30.149 --> 12:32.916
Is it <i> "vici"</i> or "vicky"?

12:33.752 --> 12:34.885
<i>Vici.</i>

12:34.887 --> 12:37.788
It's Latin, so a soft 'V'.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.289
Ah.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.358
You got tattoos?

12:41.360 --> 12:41.658
Me? No.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.228
Unless you count
"thug life"
scrawled across my chest.

12:45.364 --> 12:47.831
But that's henna, so...

12:48.801 --> 12:50.667
No, I was just
super scared, like...

12:50.669 --> 12:53.904
He's gonna be fine.
He freaks out
about everything.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.105
What? I do not.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.040
Every time you sit
down at the piano now

12:57.042 --> 12:59.009
you mention that your
hands are shrinking.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.877
My hand span does seem smaller.

13:00.879 --> 13:03.981
Okay, and then
last week you thought
your hair was going white.

13:03.983 --> 13:07.050
I found all these
white hairs on my collar.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.285
Okay, which was cat fur.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.120
I didn't do a DNA test.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.321
Okay, this is so ridiculous.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.957
KELSEY: You know
what I just realized,

13:13.959 --> 13:17.260
I have never heard
you play the piano.

13:17.262 --> 13:18.862
No, he doesn't play
in front of anybody.

13:18.864 --> 13:23.100
If I'm gonna be heckled,
I just prefer
that it's by me, that's all.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.369
That's cool.
I mean, it makes you

13:25.371 --> 13:28.071
all mysterious
and like tortured.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.874
See... Yes, tortured.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.076
That's my wheelhouse.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.645
DEVON: Oh, thank you so much.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.682
KELSEY: What did you do?
QUINN: How'd that happen? Dev!

13:38.684 --> 13:40.484
Well, I am stealthy.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.418
KELSEY: Well, thank you.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.221
Also, I'm sorry
to just dash out on everyone,

13:44.223 --> 13:46.590
but I think I'm
gonna grab a cab home.

13:46.592 --> 13:46.890
Why?

13:46.892 --> 13:50.460
I'm just so tired.
I have that
thing in the morning.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.963
Can you give these guys
a ride to Jameson's?

13:52.965 --> 13:54.498
Okay. Well, I love you.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.966
I love you.

13:55.968 --> 13:57.300
Bye.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.271
ISAAC: I'm probably gonna
head out pretty soon, too.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.106
I'm gonna go meet
up with my boys.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.775
KELSEY: Okay.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.501
I don't feel like
going to this party.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.071
All right.
Why don't I just go drop you

14:34.073 --> 14:36.006
back off with
Isaac and his boys.

14:36.008 --> 14:42.345
Because I don't feel
like getting stoned
and playing foosball.

14:42.881 --> 14:46.283
You philistine.

14:46.285 --> 14:49.553
- Don't call me names.
- (GROANS)

14:50.756 --> 14:54.091
Did I hurt the fragile flower?

14:57.329 --> 14:59.062
I'm sorry.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.181
Is that okay?

15:20.185 --> 15:22.886
I mean,
kissing my neck is okay.

15:22.888 --> 15:26.356
It's like the same
thing as hugging.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.131
No, no, no.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.133
What?

15:38.737 --> 15:43.640
I just really want to kiss you.

15:43.775 --> 15:48.578
Well, that would not be good.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.480
No, I know.

15:51.783 --> 15:54.050
I could show you my boobs.

15:56.088 --> 16:00.857
Okay, wait, wait.
This feels rapey.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.026
Why?

16:03.028 --> 16:05.762
'Cause you don't
want to kiss me.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.665
I want to.

16:10.335 --> 16:13.303
But, I can't.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.607
Yeah.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.143
(MOANS)

17:01.186 --> 17:04.454
It's not like I
could be with Kelsey.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.655
(JAMESON CHUCKLES)

17:05.656 --> 17:06.223
No, you couldn't.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.657
Her legs, though,
Jameson, they're so long.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.560
I've never seen legs
like that in person.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.262
They are freakishly long.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.432
I just... I haven't been
in another relationship.

17:15.434 --> 17:19.536
And now this
tall model likes me.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.339
I mean, she thinks I'm sexy.

17:24.276 --> 17:24.574
Manly.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.810
Okay, she modeled one time
in a catalog for Mervyn's,

17:27.813 --> 17:30.780
and a lot of girls
think you're sexy.

17:30.782 --> 17:31.881
More than think I'm sexy.

17:31.883 --> 17:34.217
Okay, first off,
girls think I'm cute,
not sexy.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.052
And, second of all,
you're just unaware
of your good looks.

17:36.054 --> 17:40.390
I wish I was
unaware of my looks,
I'm aware they're not good.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.791
Shit.

17:41.793 --> 17:43.727
I just lost a grand.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.264
What kind of dealer
gets 21 every time?

17:47.266 --> 17:48.632
A computerized one.

17:48.634 --> 17:52.769
Maybe you do
need to explore...
Wait a minute.

17:52.771 --> 17:55.038
I thought you wanted
to marry Devon one day.

17:55.040 --> 17:59.609
I do, that's what I'm saying.
It's just... Those legs...

17:59.611 --> 18:00.710
Dude,
you really need to chill out.

18:00.712 --> 18:04.247
I feel like
you're about to ask me
to help you hide the body.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.416
I'm fine,
I'm thinking clearly.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.353
I just...
I have a lot of energy.
I'm galvanized.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.188
Hey, check it out.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.757
I...

18:13.759 --> 18:16.059
am corning my own beef.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.862
Better to corn your own
than someone else's.

18:18.864 --> 18:23.233
I guess, okay, you're right.
I need to talk to Kelsey.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.935
Just patch that up and then I...

18:25.937 --> 18:27.537
She's so sexy.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.240
No, no.

18:30.575 --> 18:33.109
See, think of it like,

18:33.345 --> 18:35.912
a wet dream, right,
nothing really happened.

18:35.914 --> 18:38.948
So to talk about it,
would be awkward.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.317
So what? Suppress my feelings?

18:40.319 --> 18:41.718
And then,
by the time I examine them,

18:41.720 --> 18:42.919
they're all
tainted and deformed,

18:42.921 --> 18:44.421
and then the idea of the event
and the event itself

18:44.423 --> 18:48.725
would become inseparable
and, therefore,
impossible to analyze?

18:48.727 --> 18:49.893
I need to act now.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.396
Okay, this is not Darfur,
you don't need to act now.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.198
You need to go home.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.500
You're not making sense.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.803
Hey.

18:59.805 --> 19:03.173
Imagine that was me
slapping you in the face.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.308
That was.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.117
(DOOR OPENS)

19:14.853 --> 19:16.386
Hey.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.421
Still learning that same song?

19:18.423 --> 19:24.661
Yeah, I just can't seem
to get past this one part.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.530
How was the faculty meeting?

19:28.633 --> 19:29.966
Hilarious.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.435
Why are you being so cold?

19:32.437 --> 19:36.373
What are you talking about?
I just got back from work.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.274
I want to take a bath.

19:38.276 --> 19:39.676
We just spent the last two hours

19:39.678 --> 19:42.178
debating
the plural of "syllabus."

19:42.180 --> 19:43.246
Sorry, I...

19:43.248 --> 19:47.350
I just wanted to
ask you something.

19:47.352 --> 19:51.221
Okay,
can I just run my bath first?

19:51.690 --> 19:54.224
Sure, fine.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.199
I said, I wanted to
ask you something.

20:03.268 --> 20:03.566
Okay.

20:03.568 --> 20:07.036
But, you're in the bath.
You said you were
going to run it,

20:07.038 --> 20:08.204
not get in it.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.774
Yeah,
who could've predicted this?

20:10.776 --> 20:12.609
What is wrong with you?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.043
Nothing.

20:14.679 --> 20:18.948
I guess I've just been feeling
kind of confused recently.

20:18.950 --> 20:19.783
About what?

20:19.785 --> 20:21.751
I'm so immersed in everything.

20:21.753 --> 20:25.121
I can't... see clearly.

20:26.458 --> 20:31.795
Maybe, I just need to take
a step back for a moment.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.599
Wait a minute.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.334
What is happening right now?

20:38.336 --> 20:40.837
Nothing. I don't know. Why?

20:40.839 --> 20:42.705
Are you talking about us?

20:42.707 --> 20:45.975
Not...
No... I don't know... Maybe.

20:45.977 --> 20:48.378
Are you trying to
break up with me?

20:49.080 --> 20:53.683
I don't even know
what's happening to me.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.486
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

20:56.488 --> 20:58.955
I can't fucking believe this.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.524
Devon, wait a second.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.326
- Turn around.
- What?

21:03.328 --> 21:04.828
Don't look at me,
I'm getting dressed.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.997
Now, I can't see you naked?
Ten seconds ago it was fine.

21:07.999 --> 21:10.800
Yeah, well, a lot's happened
in the last 10 seconds.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.203
Nothing's happened.
You're overreacting.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.073
I don't even know
what I'm saying right now.

21:18.043 --> 21:19.275
Who is it?

21:19.277 --> 21:21.444
- Who is what?
- It's always someone else.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.481
What? The only girls I know
are you and Kelsey.

21:24.483 --> 21:28.685
And I'm with you,
and Kelsey is like a model...

21:29.221 --> 21:29.586
Wow.

21:29.588 --> 21:34.357
I didn't mean that.
I do hear how that sounded.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.459
Devon, what are you doing?

21:36.461 --> 21:38.361
Do you like Kelsey?

21:38.363 --> 21:40.330
Do I... No.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.131
Not like that.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.100
I swear.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.436
Wait...
There's nothing that you did.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.605
My head is just spinning...

21:48.607 --> 21:50.673
Maybe I need to gain
some sort of perspective,

21:50.675 --> 21:54.911
or objectivity for
a second before...
What are you doing?

21:54.913 --> 21:56.079
Don't touch me.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.047
I'm gonna stay
somewhere else tonight.

21:58.049 --> 22:00.517
Look,
if you don't want to see me,

22:00.519 --> 22:02.619
I can go somewhere.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.388
No, I'm going, you stay here.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.456
Where are you gonna go?

22:06.458 --> 22:07.590
I don't know, to my parents'.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.759
With wet hair?
You'll get pneumonia.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.361
Oh, please.

22:12.163 --> 22:14.030
- Fuck.
- I know.

22:14.032 --> 22:17.267
No. Thought I lost a piece.

22:17.269 --> 22:21.304
Maybe you're not really ready
to get married, dude, I mean,

22:21.306 --> 22:24.541
obviously your brain is trying
to tell you something.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.710
No, I want to marry Devon.

22:27.712 --> 22:31.981
I think.
I've just been so comfortable
with her for so long.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.716
I can't tell.

22:33.718 --> 22:36.986
It's easier to feel
when you're in pain.

22:38.623 --> 22:39.322
I guess I just

22:39.324 --> 22:45.428
fear that I've been confusing
complacency with happiness.

22:45.430 --> 22:49.132
I'm already 28,
it's just going
to start flying by.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.800
I want to feel like a man.

22:50.802 --> 22:56.573
I want to
experience crazy romance
and pining and jealousy.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.142
And whirlwind affairs
in foreign countries.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.077
Hey, check it out.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.581
It's a Middle Eastern man

23:05.116 --> 23:06.649
on the camel.

23:08.653 --> 23:09.953
They make those.

23:09.955 --> 23:13.990
I did have to special
order it, but, yeah.

23:14.492 --> 23:18.328
Okay, I'm gonna go now.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.798
Hey, man. Hey.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.133
Are you doing all right?

23:23.134 --> 23:24.534
No, I just explained that,

23:24.536 --> 23:27.236
while you were building
a scene from <i> Aladdin.</i>

23:27.238 --> 23:29.272
No. Look, I'm here for you.

23:29.274 --> 23:32.141
Okay, thank you, I need to go.

23:32.143 --> 23:33.576
- Home?
- Yes, home.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.777
- No proposing?
- None.

23:34.779 --> 23:36.279
- No Kelsey.
- No.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.014
I hope I was able to help.

23:38.016 --> 23:39.315
Yeah.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.987
Are you thinking about Devon?

23:45.690 --> 23:48.358
I don't even feel bad though.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.094
Maybe I'm a sociopath.

23:52.998 --> 23:55.898
I guess we're
allowed to kiss now.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.335
That is so romantic.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.696
Do you think maybe
we should get ready for bed?

24:27.999 --> 24:28.831
Yeah.

24:28.833 --> 24:32.702
I mean, I'm ready but, okay.

24:33.705 --> 24:35.171
Okay.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.559
Whoa.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.234
Um...

25:05.236 --> 25:08.371
I don't really
know how to ramp up
to where we were before.

25:08.373 --> 25:09.906
Do you want to talk to me?

25:09.908 --> 25:11.774
Sure. About what?

25:11.776 --> 25:13.643
No, like dirty.

25:13.645 --> 25:14.544
Oh. Oh! Um...

25:14.546 --> 25:18.147
I'm good.
I don't really have
anything to say dirtily.

25:18.149 --> 25:21.150
-Okay.
-Why? Did you want
me to talk to you?

25:21.152 --> 25:23.820
No. No, I mean,
if you wanted to.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.622
Do you want to
talk to me like that?

25:25.623 --> 25:28.124
Um, sure.
Yeah, that could be fun.

25:28.126 --> 25:29.859
Okay. Yeah. Go for it.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.428
Whenever you're ready
or take your time.

25:32.430 --> 25:35.565
Let me just set the mood.

25:36.735 --> 25:38.301
KELSEY: Um...

25:39.971 --> 25:42.438
Okay, so...

25:43.274 --> 25:44.640
Take out your cock.

25:44.642 --> 25:46.275
I haven't put it in yet.

25:46.277 --> 25:48.244
No, not out of... Never mind.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.980
Oh! Okay, yes. Yes, ma'am.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.616
Or do you want me
to address you as something?

25:53.618 --> 25:56.352
No. This is not that.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.386
You know, forget it.

25:57.388 --> 26:01.057
No, hey,
I'm taking out my cock.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.159
Okay.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.728
- Give me that thing.
- (LAUGHS)

26:07.132 --> 26:09.866
- What?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

26:10.335 --> 26:13.469
- Your hand is cold.
- (SHUSHING)

26:20.745 --> 26:25.281
KELSEY: (IN DEEPER VOICE)
That feels so good, Kelsey.
Keep going.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.582
KELSEY: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
Thanks, Quinn.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.751
Yeah, that does feel good.
Keep going.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.088
KELSEY: (IN DEEPER VOICE)
Do it faster, Kelsey. Do it.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.356
KELSEY: (IN NORMAL VOICE)
Whatever you say, Quinn.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.558
Sorry, this is making me

we could get brunch

44:26.330 --> 44:28.763
juggling women.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.935
(GIRL SCREAMING)

44:33.937 --> 44:35.637
(BOTH SIGH)

44:36.139 --> 44:38.039
Okay.

44:38.041 --> 44:40.308
I think it's out of my system.

44:42.512 --> 44:43.845
What?

44:44.281 --> 44:45.580
What?

44:45.883 --> 44:48.416
What's out of your system?

44:48.418 --> 44:50.485
What are you talking about?

44:50.487 --> 44:53.622
You just said this
is out of your system.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.391
What is out of your system?

44:57.394 --> 44:57.959
(DOOR SLAMS)

44:57.961 --> 45:01.196
GIRL: (SCREAMING) You're
a pint-sized narcissist.

45:01.965 --> 45:05.500
And I could barely
feel you inside me.

45:07.604 --> 45:09.704
-You sure you got it
out of your system?
-Yes.

45:09.706 --> 45:12.707
It was never in my
system to begin with.

45:12.709 --> 45:14.476
(JAMESON CHUCKLES)

45:14.478 --> 45:17.846
Try this.

45:19.182 --> 45:23.518
I quit my job this morning
which is a big step.

45:23.987 --> 45:26.221
Yeah,
you made a pledge to NPR,

45:26.223 --> 45:29.391
you went on one date,
and now you're unemployed.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.826
I'd call that personal growth.

45:31.828 --> 45:34.562
Yes. I've matured.

45:35.532 --> 45:37.899
You sure you want Devon?

45:37.901 --> 45:40.435
That's all I've ever wanted.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.371
Cheers to that, man.

45:43.373 --> 45:47.575
And it's been good
having you around again.

45:48.312 --> 45:50.078
Cheers, man.

45:54.284 --> 45:55.583
(COUGHS)

45:56.153 --> 45:57.585
It's spicy. (GROANS)

45:57.587 --> 46:00.021
No, it's good...
Good spice. It's painful.

46:00.023 --> 46:04.159
I call it
the Oaxacan dirty bomb.
It's pleasant though, right?

46:04.161 --> 46:05.593
Just like the name suggests.

46:05.595 --> 46:06.895
It's made with
real habanero chilies

46:06.897 --> 46:08.496
that I
cultivated hydroponically.

46:08.498 --> 46:10.999
I'm gonna go get Devon back.

46:11.001 --> 46:12.667
What about your drink?

46:12.669 --> 46:14.736
(COUGHING)

46:23.180 --> 46:27.482
Hi, Jean. Is Devon here?

46:28.151 --> 46:29.384
No.

46:30.087 --> 46:31.886
Okay.

46:34.858 --> 46:36.691
Is Devon here?

46:38.562 --> 46:40.228
No.

46:42.566 --> 46:43.231
Is she here though?

46:43.233 --> 46:45.266
What the fuck are
you doing, Quinn?

46:45.268 --> 46:47.402
This isn't Anne Frank.

46:47.404 --> 46:49.471
She's not here.
What do you want?

46:52.442 --> 46:56.177
I want to be back with her.

46:56.179 --> 46:59.080
I was an idiot.

46:59.216 --> 47:04.085
I know it now, and I need her.

47:04.788 --> 47:06.654
I'm falling apart.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.758
Hey, man.

47:15.932 --> 47:18.333
Quinn, I thought
when I saw you again,

47:18.335 --> 47:22.537
I would slap you till you had
to have your jaw wired shut.

47:24.141 --> 47:24.706
But I look at you now

47:24.708 --> 47:29.210
and you're like a poor,
pathetic, wounded gazelle.

47:29.446 --> 47:31.179
Thank you.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.148
She's gone.

47:33.683 --> 47:36.518
- Devon?
- She left last week.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.521
- Where?
- Paris.

47:39.623 --> 47:41.856
We have family there.

47:41.858 --> 47:42.357
She got a place.

47:42.359 --> 47:46.561
She's gonna take a semester
off from the university,
find herself.

47:46.563 --> 47:50.765
Well, how long is
she gonna be there?

47:51.468 --> 47:53.802
I can't get in
the middle of this.

47:58.141 --> 48:00.141
(PHONE RINGS)

48:05.682 --> 48:06.915
Hello.

48:07.150 --> 48:09.984
Hi. Hi.

48:10.053 --> 48:15.056
I'm so sorry that I showed up
at the Ethiopian place.

48:15.258 --> 48:17.258
No. It's fine.

48:18.061 --> 48:18.893
What are you doing?

48:18.895 --> 48:25.266
Honestly, trying to figure out
Devon's exact
location in Paris

48:25.268 --> 48:26.935
<i>so I can chase her down.</i>

48:26.937 --> 48:29.270
<i>Well, didn't she send flowers
through the shop</i>

48:29.272 --> 48:31.473
<i>to her, like,
grandparents in France?</i>

48:31.475 --> 48:34.075
<i>Their address is
probably in the database.</i>

48:34.077 --> 48:38.046
She's not staying with them.
They don't speak English.

48:38.048 --> 48:43.718
Well, I really just wanted
to say I was sorry
for being a total idiot.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.018
No.

48:44.020 --> 48:51.159
Sometimes
the healthiest thing we can do
is make a fool of ourself.

48:59.035 --> 49:00.068
Yes, Quinn.

49:00.070 --> 49:02.003
- Hi. Hey, Kurt.
- Hey.

49:02.005 --> 49:02.971
Listen,
I want to send her flowers.

49:02.973 --> 49:07.609
A housewarming gift.
You gotta let me do that.
Please.

49:07.611 --> 49:08.743
I'm an ex-florist, okay?

49:08.745 --> 49:11.779
I know what flowers she wants,
what she needs.

49:11.781 --> 49:17.118
Can I just have her address?
I mean, come on,
what am I gonna do?

49:18.622 --> 49:20.822
(MUSIC PLAYING)

50:40.370 --> 50:41.603
What?

50:41.605 --> 50:44.772
Quinn. Oh, my God! You're...

50:44.774 --> 50:46.808
You're here.

50:47.744 --> 50:50.111
- I am.
- Okay.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.514
Wow. Okay.

50:55.018 --> 50:57.552
- Come on in.
- All right. You sure or...

50:57.554 --> 51:01.322
Yeah. I mean, I assume
that's why you're in Paris,

51:01.324 --> 51:02.790
at my door, with a suitcase.

51:02.792 --> 51:05.326
Yeah. I mean,
if it's a bad time or...

51:05.328 --> 51:07.328
- Come in.
- Okay.

51:21.211 --> 51:24.245
How did you know where I was?

51:24.247 --> 51:26.147
I have my ways.

51:26.783 --> 51:31.786
- This is beautiful, nice.
- Thanks. Yeah.

51:31.788 --> 51:32.353
Thanks.

51:32.355 --> 51:36.624
- I brought you something.
- Oh.

51:37.494 --> 51:38.860
Oh!

51:39.963 --> 51:41.996
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

51:43.466 --> 51:45.900
Right. (CHUCKLES)

51:45.902 --> 51:47.669
- Clogs.
- Yeah.

51:47.671 --> 51:50.705
They're handmade, in America.

51:50.707 --> 51:51.472
Thanks.

51:51.474 --> 51:53.308
How did you find this place?

51:53.310 --> 51:57.679
Well, a couple who
are friends of my mom's...

51:58.548 --> 52:01.316
- It's their son's.
- Oh.

52:01.885 --> 52:03.518
Is he here?

52:03.520 --> 52:05.353
No, no.

52:05.355 --> 52:06.854
He was when I got here,

52:06.856 --> 52:11.626
but he is staying in Provence
with his family now.

52:13.363 --> 52:16.297
I actually went down there
for a couple of days

52:16.299 --> 52:19.634
to stay with his family and him.

52:19.636 --> 52:21.636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:26.209 --> 52:32.013
What is he...
What does he do, this son?
How old is he?

52:32.015 --> 52:36.651
Um, he is 32.
He's a classical violinist.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.619
He tours around with his dad.

52:38.621 --> 52:40.188
(EXCLAIMS)

52:42.826 --> 52:48.730
It's funny,
I just watched <i> 400 Blows.</i>

52:49.566 --> 52:50.765
Yeah?

52:50.767 --> 52:57.572
Well, no, I'm just saying
'cause it's French and all,
and here we are.

52:57.574 --> 53:01.542
It's <i> coincidence.</i>

53:04.547 --> 53:06.080
Did he play for you?

53:06.916 --> 53:10.118
- Did who...
- The kid.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.587
Guillaume. Yeah.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.188
Is he okay or...

53:14.190 --> 53:16.023
He was amazing.

53:17.894 --> 53:19.026
What did he play?

53:19.028 --> 53:21.362
Oh, gee, I think
he played some Mozart.

53:21.364 --> 53:27.001
Mmm, Mozart.
Yeah, it's pretty music.

53:27.837 --> 53:32.607
It's interesting
'cause it's not as
technically challenging

53:32.609 --> 53:36.411
as other composers,
you know, Bach and...

53:36.413 --> 53:36.911
It sounded nice.

53:36.913 --> 53:40.715
No. That's the thing.
It does, you know.

53:40.884 --> 53:43.684
Even though it's easier.

53:51.761 --> 53:53.661
So how long are...

53:53.663 --> 53:56.764
-When are you
supposed to go back?
-Mmm?

53:56.766 --> 53:58.599
How long are you here for?

53:58.601 --> 54:02.737
Oh, I can't remember.
I have to check the ticket.

54:02.739 --> 54:05.072
It's flexible. I mean...

54:05.074 --> 54:07.108
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

54:09.679 --> 54:13.614
What is happening?
Do you not want me here?

54:14.684 --> 54:17.051
No, it's not that.

54:18.354 --> 54:20.221
I'm sorry, it's just...

54:20.290 --> 54:24.425
Jesus Christ!
I was not expecting this.

54:24.427 --> 54:27.361
Yeah, because it was a surprise.

54:27.363 --> 54:30.765
I'm here in Paris
to win you back.

54:30.767 --> 54:32.867
This was supposed
to be my time to...

54:32.869 --> 54:35.203
- Find yourself, I know.
- Yeah.

54:35.205 --> 54:40.541
Well, I came to tell you
that you can stop looking

54:40.710 --> 54:43.678
because you're perfect
the way you are.

54:46.149 --> 54:51.219
You know, this has brought up
a lot of issues for me too.

54:52.689 --> 54:56.757
And I just don't know

54:56.759 --> 54:58.526
if you're ready to be with me.

54:58.528 --> 55:02.763
I am. I, you know,
explored and grew...

55:02.765 --> 55:06.567
Well, I may need to do that too.

55:07.170 --> 55:08.903
Is there...

55:08.905 --> 55:12.039
Did you meet
someone or something?

55:14.177 --> 55:18.346
Wait, you met some fucking guy
named Guillaume?

55:18.348 --> 55:20.848
In like the last week?

55:21.451 --> 55:23.017
What happened?

55:23.019 --> 55:23.584
Are you with him now?

55:23.586 --> 55:25.820
You don't even know him.
This is bullshit.

55:25.822 --> 55:27.388
It's not bullshit.

55:27.390 --> 55:28.890
So what? It's real love? Okay.

55:28.892 --> 55:30.791
Sorry, I forgot
running off to Paris.

55:30.793 --> 55:32.260
The odds are that
within the first week,

55:32.262 --> 55:33.294
you'll meet
the man of your dreams.

55:33.296 --> 55:34.962
The world
according to Nancy Meyers.

55:34.964 --> 55:37.532
It has nothing to do
with getting back at me.

55:37.534 --> 55:39.500
You weren't even
supposed to be here.

55:39.502 --> 55:41.235
How is this about you right now?

55:41.237 --> 55:45.306
And don't judge my
feelings or romances.

55:45.308 --> 55:47.608
You thought you're in love
with some wannabe model.

55:47.610 --> 55:49.577
She modelled once for Mervyn's.

55:49.579 --> 55:54.882
And my feelings were misguided
and I am now mature
enough to see that.

55:54.884 --> 55:56.350
Are you?

55:58.021 --> 55:59.420
Have you slept with him?

55:59.422 --> 55:59.720
No.

55:59.722 --> 56:02.957
-But you stayed with
him in Prussia or...
-Provence.

56:02.959 --> 56:05.026
-Whatever and you
didn't sleep with him?
-No.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.227
- Did you kiss him?
- Quinn...

56:06.229 --> 56:08.696
You know what,
I don't even want to know.

56:08.698 --> 56:09.263
Where are you going?

56:09.265 --> 56:11.866
You don't even know your way
back home and
you grew up there.

56:11.868 --> 56:15.002
Well, maybe we
should phone Guillaume
at his country house

56:15.004 --> 56:15.703
and ask him for directions.

56:15.705 --> 56:17.905
See if he has
any recommendations
for city hotspots.

56:17.907 --> 56:20.207
I'm sure he could tell us
where the Fitzgeralds,

56:20.209 --> 56:24.345
or Hemingway used to
smoke opium or whatever. What?

56:24.347 --> 56:25.012
No, it's just...

56:25.014 --> 56:30.351
F. Scott Fitzgerald actually
lived in their house
in Provence for a while.

56:30.353 --> 56:34.121
Well, that is most
fucking amusing.

56:37.360 --> 56:38.759
<i>Merci.</i>

56:45.535 --> 56:46.467
You don't smoke.

56:59.515 --> 57:01.849
It'll put hair on your chest.

57:01.851 --> 57:04.719
I preferred your chest
the way it was.

will it come back to life?

(CHUCKLING)

58:35.578 --> 58:38.446
No, no, no,
we can't do it on his bed.

58:38.548 --> 58:39.880
What?

58:40.583 --> 58:42.416
Okay, okay.

58:42.985 --> 58:44.919
This is only good if
you have scoliosis.

58:44.921 --> 58:47.354
Yeah, this is not the greatest.

58:53.529 --> 58:58.632
My God,
that's like a Danish deco,
like really expensive.

58:58.701 --> 58:59.701
How about this thing?

58:59.702 --> 59:02.169
This thing,
it's like a Napoleon era...

59:02.171 --> 59:04.271
I don't give a shit.
Just, here.

59:04.273 --> 59:06.941
I do, I'm sorry. I'm a guest.

59:10.279 --> 59:11.612
Okay.

59:13.616 --> 59:17.051
Just be careful.
It's like
a Franco-Prussian teacup.

59:17.053 --> 59:19.520
What, are you
his fucking curator?

59:19.522 --> 59:21.422
Sorry, kind of.

59:26.896 --> 59:28.629
(WATER RUNNING)

59:29.165 --> 59:31.632
- Good morning.
- (MUFFLED) Hi.

59:31.834 --> 59:34.935
- Sleep good?
- (MUFFLED) Mmm-hmm.

59:35.972 --> 59:38.739
So I was thinking,
we should call the airline

59:38.741 --> 59:43.310
and try to get
tickets to go home
today or tonight.

59:43.513 --> 59:46.914
DEVON: (MUFFLED) Uh... What?

59:47.416 --> 59:49.183
Or tomorrow.

59:53.523 --> 59:54.789
Devon.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.540
Fuck it.
I'm going to enjoy Paris.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:16.844

when you got back.

I was going to
pull this string.
