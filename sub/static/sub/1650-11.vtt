WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:05.287
- Rick: We're not leaving.
- Hershel: We can't stay here.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.079
Maggie:
What if there's another sniper?

00:07.258 --> 00:08.714
A wood pallet won't stop one
of those rounds.

00:08.885 --> 00:10.876
- Beth: We can't even go outside.
- Carol: Not in the daylight.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.385
Glenn: Rick says we're not running,
we're not running.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.343
No, better to live like rats.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.382
You got a better idea?

00:18.561 --> 00:20.677
Yeah, we should have slid
out of here last night

00:20.855 --> 00:22.561
and lived to fight
another day.

00:22.732 --> 00:25.189
But we lost
that window, didn't we?

00:25.359 --> 00:28.192
I'm sure he's got scouts on every road
out of this place by now.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.444
We ain't scared
of that prick.

00:30.615 --> 00:32.401
Merle:
Y'all should be.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.736
That truck through
the fence thing,

00:34.911 --> 00:37.072
that's just him
ringing the doorbell.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.988
We might have some thick
walls to hide behind,

00:40.166 --> 00:42.578
but he's got the guns
and the numbers.

00:42.752 --> 00:45.084
And if he takes the high ground
around this place,

00:45.254 --> 00:49.588
shoot, he could just starve
us out if he wanted to.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.171
Let's put him
in the other cell block.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.210
No. He's got a point.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.299
This is all you.
You started this.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.760
What difference whose fault it is?
What do we do?

00:58.935 --> 01:00.516
I said we should leave.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.768
Now Axel's dead.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.351
We can'tjust sit here.

01:07.777 --> 01:10.268
( yells )
Get back here!

01:13.574 --> 01:15.610
You're slipping, Rick.

01:15.785 --> 01:18.276
We've all seen it.
We understand why.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.319
But now is not the time.

01:20.498 --> 01:23.114
You once said
this isn't a democracy.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.624
Now you have to
own up to that.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.958
I put my family's life
in your hands.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.292
So get your head clear

01:31.467 --> 01:34.004
and do something.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.464
( creaks )

01:45.564 --> 01:48.226
(walkers snarling )

02:30.026 --> 02:32.893
( door opens)

02:38.576 --> 02:40.191
You shouldn't be
out here.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.702
I'm a good shot.

02:43.873 --> 02:45.864
Yes, you are.

02:50.296 --> 02:51.877
Hey,Dad?

02:52.048 --> 02:53.709
Yeah?

02:55.217 --> 02:57.833
If I say something,
will you promise not to be mad?

02:58.012 --> 03:00.924
I won't get mad.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.766
You should stop.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.676
Stop what?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.767
Being the leader.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.733
Let Hershel and Daryl
handle things.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.116
You deserve a rest.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.344
(theme music playing )

04:22.096 --> 04:24.303
Governor:
How many does that give us now?

04:24.473 --> 04:28.557
20. We have several people
with chronic conditions,

04:28.727 --> 04:31.434
hearing impairments,
arthritis.

04:31.605 --> 04:36.144
Adding those
gives us 26.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.521
And if we include men
and women age 13 and up?

04:41.699 --> 04:43.610
You mean boys and girls?

04:43.784 --> 04:48.699
Adolescence--
it's a 20th century invention.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.829
Men and women.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.835
Uh, 35.

04:57.006 --> 05:00.419
Well, make sure they all have
sidearms and plenty of ammo.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.834
We'll start training
when Martinez is ready.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.802
Well, come in.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.969
What's this I hear
about the prison?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.978
You said you were
gonna leave it alone.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.434
No retaliation.

05:16.609 --> 05:18.224
I went to negotiate.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.233
Bad enough we got
biters at our gates.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.611
We can't have aggressors
just miles away.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.396
So you went and welcomed
them to the neighborhood?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.315
You know they shot at us?

05:26.494 --> 05:28.701
I don't know who these people
were when you were with them,

05:28.871 --> 05:31.908
but they've changed.
They're bloodthirsty.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.248
You knew about this?

05:35.419 --> 05:38.252
l was informed
this morning.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.787
I didn't know.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.546
Don't drag him into it.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.629
You're right.
This is between you and me.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.636
I'm sick of this.
Sick of the lies.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.216
And I'm not gonna watch
this town

05:49.391 --> 05:50.927
and my friends
gun each other down.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.602
Well, it's too late.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.351
What do you mean
it's too late?

05:54.522 --> 05:55.807
I don't know what
you're trying to prove,

05:55.981 --> 05:57.357
but enough is enough.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.265
I'm going to see them.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.728
I'll work this out.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.859
Well, they're hostile.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.238
These are all the able-bodied
people we have.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.319
They're gonna carry arms
and receive training.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.280
We won't get caught
sleeping again.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.070
One car,
that is all I need.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.661
The roads are blocked.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.247
We barely made it
back ourselves.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.462
Andrea.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.344
You go to that prison,

06:29.515 --> 06:31.722
you stay there.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.744
Karen:
Noah's only 14.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.034
Okay? He has asthma.
He can't run more than 10 yards

07:00.212 --> 07:02.328
before losing his breath.
What good is that to you?

07:02.506 --> 07:04.622
Martinez: The Governor wants
everyone who can hold a gun

07:04.800 --> 07:07.792
- in front of the town hall now.
- No.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.177
Andrea, you have to
straighten this out.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.723
They want Noah to fight.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.222
Who's talking
aboutﬁghﬁng?

07:14.393 --> 07:17.009
You're supposed to be teaching
people to defend themselves,

07:17.187 --> 07:18.927
not raising an army.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.472
Wake up.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.938
The only way to defend
ourselves is with an army.

07:26.697 --> 07:29.655
Take watch.
Eyes open, head down.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.784
Field's filled with walkers.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.490
Didn't see any
snipers out there,

07:35.664 --> 07:37.529
but we'll keep
Maggie on watch.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.790
I'll get up
in the guard tower,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.622
take out half them walkers, give these
guys a chance to fix the fence.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.048
Or use some of the cars
to put the bus in place.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.548
We can't access the field
without burning through our bullets.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.802
So we're trapped in here.
There's barely any food or ammo.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.883
Been here before.
We'll be all right.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.299
That's when it was
just us.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.342
Before there was
a snake in the nest.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.135
Man, we gonna go
through this again?

08:00.314 --> 08:03.101
Look, Merle's staying here.
He's with us now.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.231
- Get used to it.
- Hey.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.393
All y'all.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.949
Seriously, Rick, I don't think Merle
living here is really gonna fly.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.905
I can't kick him out.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.537
I wouldn't ask you to live with Shane
after he tried to kill you.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.449
Merle has
military experience.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.538
He may be erratic,

08:23.712 --> 08:26.374
but don't underestimate
his loyalty to his brother.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.504
What if we solve both
problems at once?

08:28.676 --> 08:31.088
Deliver Merle to the Governor.
Bargaining chip.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.344
Give him his traitor,
maybe declare a truce.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.108
You're the farmer Hershel.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.942
And you're
the black sheep Merle.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.901
How'd you lose it?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.911
l was bit.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.324
Bit?
You hack it off yourself?

09:03.502 --> 09:05.333
No.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.421
Rick did.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.128
Awful kindly of him.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.293
Saved my life.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.884
Gave me more time
with my girls.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.470
Gave you more time
with your brother.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.807
Can't put a price on that.

09:23.981 --> 09:27.223
Can't put a price
on anything anymore.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.114
I found this

09:36.285 --> 09:38.776
in one of the cells.

09:40.289 --> 09:43.622
Lost more than the Good Book
there for a while.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.908
Lost my way.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.176
"And if your right hand
offends you,

09:55.345 --> 09:58.553
cut it off,
cast it from you.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.386
For it is profitable

10:01.560 --> 10:03.642
that one of your members
should perish--"

10:03.812 --> 10:07.680
"And not that thy whole body
should be cast into hell."

10:09.151 --> 10:12.359
Matthew 5:29 and 30.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.494
Woodbury had
a damn fine library.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.327
One of the only things
I miss about it.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.750
When the Governor returns,

10:32.925 --> 10:35.337
he's gonna kill me first.

10:35.511 --> 10:39.129
Michonne, my brother,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.797
then your girls.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.681
Glenn, Carl, the baby,

10:43.852 --> 10:45.592
whoever else is left.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.682
He'll save Rick for last

10:47.856 --> 10:51.223
so he can watch his family
and friends die ugly.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.643
That's who
you're dealing with.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.116
This is Mrs. McLeod.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.572
She's the one
with arthritis.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.409
Well, thank you, dear,

11:10.587 --> 11:13.203
but we'll find another way
you can help us.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.178
Noah's asthmatic.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.514
You ever shoot
a gun, son?

11:32.693 --> 11:35.730
I had a BB gun once.
My mom took it away.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.611
Well, you're gonna learn
from the best.

11:50.252 --> 11:54.245
Haven't had a chance to say
I'm glad you came back.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.757
To what?
All this?

12:00.262 --> 12:02.799
This is our home.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.925
This is a tomb.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.600
That's what T-Dog
called it.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.436
Thought he was right

12:15.611 --> 12:17.818
till you found me.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.623
He's your brother,
but he's not good for you.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.829
Don't let him
bring you down.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.125
After all,
look how far you've come.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.800
( both laugh )

13:00.989 --> 13:02.980
We sealed it thoroughly.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.820
Nobody's getting in or out.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.912
I'm gonna ask
you something

13:11.083 --> 13:13.074
and I need you
to be honest.

13:13.251 --> 13:15.333
Okay.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.495
The fight at the prison,

13:17.673 --> 13:19.504
you swear you didn't know
anything about it?

13:19.675 --> 13:21.791
I wouldn't advocate
a move like that.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.834
It's just posturing.

13:24.012 --> 13:27.300
Good. Then you have to
cover for me.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.840
I'm going to the prison.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.555
- And the Governor can't know.
- Don't.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.845
l have to.
l was with them.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.854
Don't put me
in this situation.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.981
- | wish there was another way.
- If he finds out--

13:39.152 --> 13:40.358
That's a chance
we have to take.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.518
Maybe you do,
but I don't.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.483
I'm sorry. I can't.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.648
Look at
what's happened.

13:45.826 --> 13:49.239
Woodbury is an armed camp
with child soldiers.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.029
Cannon fodder in a war
over what?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.822
Is that what
all your work is for?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.992
Please, help me
get out of here.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.036
I can't take a car.
They won't open the gates.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.832
| just need to sneak out,
make my way to the prison,

14:03.010 --> 14:05.001
- and talk to Rick.
- This is a betrayal.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.717
No, it's an attempt to stop this
before more people get killed.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.052
You can do this, Milton.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.065
( groans )

14:24.031 --> 14:25.896
( strikes match )

14:30.579 --> 14:33.036
( faint gasp )

14:42.466 --> 14:45.424
( knocks )

14:45.594 --> 14:48.461
- Come in.
- ( door opens)

14:52.059 --> 14:54.641
You asked me
to keep tabs on her.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.975
That's right.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.060
She's going back
to the prison

15:04.237 --> 15:06.979
and has requested
my assistance in escaping.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.239
Her words, not mine.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.073
Help her.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.739
Okay, do you really
want me to do that,

15:17.918 --> 15:19.328
or is this
some sort of test?

15:19.503 --> 15:22.040
( chuckles )

15:22.214 --> 15:25.547
If she asks for help,

15:25.717 --> 15:27.958
help her.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.594
Milton.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.972
Good work.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.933
(snarling )

16:07.384 --> 16:09.170
Hey, you!

16:09.344 --> 16:11.380
(snarling )

16:11.555 --> 16:14.342
Oh, shit. Andrea!

16:17.018 --> 16:18.883
Pin it down.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.144
Don't let it up.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.199
Just a little more.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.713
(grunts)

17:04.107 --> 17:05.688
Lift its head.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.017
Force it down.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.063
- Hey, hold it! Hold it!
- Milton: I'm trying.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.755
- ( snarling )
- Watch out.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.929
All right.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.058
Can we finish
this up, please?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.969
I got it.
I got it.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.617
(snarling )

18:21.935 --> 18:24.142
Smart to stay fit.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.022
Don't leave out
the cardio.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.651
You know, if we're gonna
live under the same roof,

18:33.822 --> 18:36.313
we should clear the air.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.326
that was just business.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.998
Carrying out orders.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.952
Hmm.
Like the Gestapo.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.493
Yeah. Exactly.

18:51.673 --> 18:54.130
I've done a lot of things
I ain't proud of.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.792
Before and after.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.306
Anyway, hope we
can get past it.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.844
Let bygones
be bygones.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.191
It's a diversionary tactic.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.230
It keeps
the walkers away.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.525
Didn't work so well
with those two.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.034
You got a camp?

19:29.544 --> 19:32.001
It's just us.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.544
We have a town.
It's walled.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.755
Milton:
There's about 70 of us.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.509
You take people in?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.220
We do.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.851
- I'll take them back.
- Are you sure?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.933
- If he asks, just--
- |'|| handle it.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.853
I'm better with him
than I am with them.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.235
Thank you so much.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.195
We've had a rough
couple of days.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.861
- Where you going?
- Got to finish my run.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.200
- By yourself?
- I'll be fine.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.411
Got my guardian
angel here.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.871
- Need any help?
- Nope.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.253
I'm good.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.338
(snarling )

20:52.419 --> 20:54.455
Carl:
Psst

20:54.629 --> 20:56.460
Something weird
out there.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.813
( whispers )
Andrea.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.188
Get your dad
and the others.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.525
Go.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.858
Clear!

22:07.494 --> 22:10.031
- Are you alone?
- Open the gate.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.695
Are you alone?!

22:11.873 --> 22:13.659
Rick!

22:21.549 --> 22:23.335
Open it.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.422
Hands up!
Turn around.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.882
- What?
- Turn around now!

22:36.231 --> 22:37.266
- ( snarling )
- ( screams )

22:37.440 --> 22:40.022
Get down
on the floor.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.025
lasked
if you were alone.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.565
lam.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.762
Welcome back.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.469
Get up.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.285
After you saved me,
we thought you were dead.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.294
Hershel, my God.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.130
I can't believe this.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.513
Where's Shane?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.643
And Lori?

24:10.325 --> 24:13.943
Hershel: She had a girl.
Lori didn't survive.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.486
Neither did T-Dog.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.155
I'm so sorry.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.288
Carl.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.174
Rick, |--

24:39.395 --> 24:41.727
You all live here?

24:41.898 --> 24:45.482
Here and the cell block.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.563
There?

24:47.737 --> 24:49.693
Well, can I go in?

24:49.864 --> 24:53.573
- I won't allow that.
- I'm not an enemy, Rick.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.825
We had that field
and courtyard

24:55.995 --> 24:58.202
until your boyfriend
tore down the fence

24:58.373 --> 25:00.034
with a truck
and shot us up.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.700
He said you fired first.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.664
Well, he's lying.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.877
He killed an inmate
who survived in here.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.884
We liked him.
He was one of us.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.716
I didn't know
anything about that.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.176
As soon as I found out,
I came.

25:18.351 --> 25:22.515
I didn't even know you were in
Woodbury until after the shoot-out.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.895
That was days ago.

25:24.065 --> 25:27.023
I told you, I came
as soon as I could.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.405
- What have you told them?
- Nothing.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.861
I don't get it.
I left Atlanta with you people

25:37.036 --> 25:38.412
and now
I'm the odd man out?

25:38.579 --> 25:41.571
He almost killed Michonne
and he would have killed us.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.125
With his finger
on the trigger.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.907
Isn't he the one
who kidnapped you?

25:45.086 --> 25:47.452
Who beat you?

25:49.924 --> 25:51.755
Look,

25:51.926 --> 25:55.544
I cannot excuse or explain
what Philip has done.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.555
But I am here trying
to bring us together.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.431
We have to work this out.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.932
There's nothing
to work out.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.809
We're gonna kill him.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.596
I don't know how
or when, but we will.

26:06.774 --> 26:10.312
We can settle this.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.728
There is room at Woodbury
for all of you.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.114
( Merle chuckles )
You know better than that.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.653
What makes you think
this man wants to negotiate?

26:21.831 --> 26:23.867
Hershel:
Did he say that?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.622
No.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.330
Rick: Then why did you
come here?

26:28.504 --> 26:31.291
Because he's
gearing up for war.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.707
The people are terrified.
They see you as killers.

26:33.885 --> 26:35.967
They're training to attack.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.799
I'll tell you what.
Next time you see Philip,

26:38.973 --> 26:41.134
you tell him I'm gonna
take his other eye.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.470
We're taken too much shit
for too long.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.384
He wants a war?
He's got one.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.647
Rick.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.900
If you don't sit down
and try to work this out,

26:53.070 --> 26:55.322
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.072
He has a whole town.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.692
Look at you.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.408
You've lost
so much already.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.698
You can't stand
alone anymore.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.583
You want to make
this right, get us inside.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.085
- No.
- Then we got nothing to talk about.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.870
There are innocent people.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.800
( door opens,
bangs shut )

27:25.061 --> 27:27.518
You poisoned them.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.680
| just told them the truth.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.849
I didn't choose him
overyou.

27:33.027 --> 27:34.528
I wanted a life.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.528
Once we entered Woodbury,
you became hostile.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.950
- That's 'cause I could see it.
- See what?

27:40.117 --> 27:43.735
That you were under his spell
from the second you laid eyes on him.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.279
- That is not true.
- And you still are.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.948
No, I am there
because those people need me.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.536
And what about
these people?

27:50.711 --> 27:52.451
I'm trying to save
them, too.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.712
( laughs)

27:54.882 --> 27:58.500
I did not realize the messiah complex
was contagious.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.509
Go to hell, Michonne.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.673
He sent Merle
to kill me.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.894
Would have sent him to kill you, too,
if you had come with me.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.727
But you didn't, did you?

28:13.901 --> 28:15.437
Hm-mmm.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.353
You chose a warm bed
over a friend.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.733
That's why I went back
to Woodbury.

28:23.911 --> 28:27.574
Exposed him
for what he is.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.040
I knew that it
would hurt you.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.770
(sighs)

29:00.907 --> 29:04.274
Dr. Stevens will be here soon.
We'll get you checked over.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.659
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.410
Now you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.163
We got food,
fresh clothing, hot water.

29:11.334 --> 29:14.292
Normally we'd provide you with
weapons and a car for yourjourney,

29:14.462 --> 29:16.669
but we need all we have.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.000
Looks like you're battening down
the hatches. Were you guys attacked?

29:19.175 --> 29:22.338
Yeah, but not by biters.
Some dangerous people out there.

29:24.013 --> 29:26.129
They came at us
a few days ago.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.298
Anyone hurt?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.602
There were several fatalities.

29:32.772 --> 29:37.186
- Ben: Damn. Sorry.
- Yeah.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.022
Can't be too careful
these days.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.938
When you're ready
to travel, head west.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.980
Avoid anything north up 85.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.366
We just came from there.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.993
Ran into some
whack-job in a prison.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.669
You saw him?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.501
Oh, yeah.
Screaming like an idiot.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.541
He's a little unhinged.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.005
But the others
seemed decent.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.887
Everything seemed cool
until their leader came back

30:09.058 --> 30:10.798
and practically shoved
a gun in my face.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.514
You were at the prison?

30:13.688 --> 30:17.351
We went in for shelter.
Lost Allen's wife.

30:17.525 --> 30:20.517
This guy Rick showed up
all of sudden, chased us out.

30:20.695 --> 30:24.404
You need help
with these guys? We're in.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.734
Well, now, no...

30:26.909 --> 30:29.821
we couldn't ask you
to join in our fight.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.532
Look, we don't want
to be out there.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.162
It's only a matter
of time before--

30:33.332 --> 30:35.823
No, I understand.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.744
Whatever we got to do
to earn our keep.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.831
Were you inside
the prison?

30:43.009 --> 30:44.715
Can you describe
the layout?

30:44.885 --> 30:47.718
It's pretty confusing,
but I could try.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.880
You get your rest.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.435
We can talk
about it tomorrow.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.059
As I say, you're welcome to
stay here as long as you like.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.563
But you take the night.
Talk it over.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.565
Good night.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.197
You can't leave without
meeting Little Ass-Kicker.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.028
May I hold her?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.238
- Of course.
- Oh.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.278
Got her?

31:14.457 --> 31:15.867
lgothen

31:16.042 --> 31:18.875
- ( baby fusses )
- Oh, look at you.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.752
Let me guess.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.708
Daryl named her
"Ass-Kicker."

31:23.883 --> 31:24.963
( laughs)

31:25.134 --> 31:26.544
That's not
really her name.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.210
- Judith.
- Judith.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.470
Hi, Judith.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.928
Oh, how precious
are you?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.722
What happened to Lori?

31:41.901 --> 31:44.608
During a C-section.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.735
Maggie.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.238
- Carl had to--
- Oh, my God.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.150
T-Dog died leading me
to safety.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.825
And Shane?

31:56.999 --> 31:59.786
Rick killed him.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.915
The night we left
the farm.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.752
That whole Randall
thing was a lie.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.087
Shane tried to kill Rick.

32:10.513 --> 32:13.801
Shane loved Rick.

32:13.974 --> 32:15.475
Shane loved Lori.

32:18.646 --> 32:22.013
Rick's become cold.

32:22.191 --> 32:24.147
Unsteady.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.818
He has his reasons.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.991
The Governor,
you need to do something.

32:34.161 --> 32:36.197
lam.

32:36.372 --> 32:39.956
No, you need
to sleep with him.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.663
Give him the greatest
night of his life.

32:42.837 --> 32:44.498
You get him
to drop his guard.

32:44.672 --> 32:48.631
Then when he's sleeping,
you can end this.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.323
Thanks.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.701
Can you spare it?

33:18.873 --> 33:20.909
Yeah.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.842
Well, take care.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.559
Andrea.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.240
Be careful.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.073
You, too.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.910
(engine starts)

34:34.949 --> 34:36.485
Go!

34:39.453 --> 34:41.910
(snarling )

34:49.964 --> 34:52.250
( gate screeches )

34:53.968 --> 34:56.334
( Merle yells )

35:06.021 --> 35:07.852
Heads up!

35:08.023 --> 35:10.480
Hey, get down.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.827
That's far enough.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.621
Hands up.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.890
(music playing )

35:59.742 --> 36:02.358
I went to the prison.

36:02.536 --> 36:04.197
They're broken,

36:04.371 --> 36:07.204
living in horrible
conditions.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.865
Michonne there?

36:11.337 --> 36:13.202

36:13.380 --> 36:15.541
Yes.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.173
And Rick?

36:23.515 --> 36:25.346
Yes.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.763
He send you back here?

36:30.105 --> 36:32.061
No.

36:32.232 --> 36:35.190
That was my call.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.734
Why?

37:02.763 --> 37:05.300
'Cause you belong here.

38:02.030 --> 38:06.990
J‘ They hung a sign
up in ourtown J‘

38:07.161 --> 38:12.030
J‘ If you live it up,
you won't live it down J‘

38:13.459 --> 38:18.123
J‘ So she left
Monte Rio, son J‘

38:18.297 --> 38:23.667
J‘ Just like a bullet
leaves a gun J‘

38:25.304 --> 38:29.217
J‘ With charcoal eyes
and Monroe hips J‘

38:29.391 --> 38:34.806
J‘ She went and took
the California trip J‘

38:34.980 --> 38:38.939
J‘ Well, the moon was gold
and her hair like wind J‘

38:39.109 --> 38:40.519
J‘ Said don't
look back now J‘

38:40.694 --> 38:43.151
J‘ Just come on, Jim J‘

38:43.322 --> 38:45.813
J‘ You got to hold on J‘

38:45.991 --> 38:47.652
J‘ Hold on J‘

38:47.826 --> 38:49.987
J‘ You got to hold on J‘

38:50.162 --> 38:52.574
J‘ Take my hand,
I'm standing right here J‘

38:52.748 --> 38:55.205
J‘ You got to hold on J‘

38:55.375 --> 39:00.085
J‘ Well, he gave her
a dime-store watch J‘

39:00.255 --> 39:04.840
J‘ And a ring
made from a spoon J‘

39:05.010 --> 39:08.673
J‘ Everyone's looking
for someone to blame J‘

39:08.847 --> 39:14.592
J‘ If you share my bed,
you share my name... J‘

39:14.770 --> 39:17.728
Some reunion, huh?

39:17.898 --> 39:20.355
She's in ajam.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.391
We all are.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.730
Andrea's persuasive.

39:24.905 --> 39:28.022
This fella's armed
to the teeth.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.361
Bent on destruction.

39:30.536 --> 39:33.118
So what do you
want to do?

39:33.288 --> 39:34.744
We match it.

39:34.915 --> 39:36.621
I'm going on a run.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.248
l'll head out tomorrow.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.033
No, you stay here.

39:40.212 --> 39:43.045
Keep an eye
on your brother.

39:43.215 --> 39:46.378
I'm glad you're back, really,

39:46.552 --> 39:49.965
but if he causes
a problem, it's on you.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.925
lgot him.

39:54.977 --> 39:57.935
- I'll take Michonne.
- Daryl: You sure that's a good idea?

39:58.105 --> 40:00.096
I'll find out.

40:00.274 --> 40:03.391
And Carl.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.561
He's ready.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.945
You hold it down here.

40:09.116 --> 40:11.402
You got it.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.410
Beth: J‘ When there's nothing
left to keep you here J‘

40:14.580 --> 40:17.788
J‘ When you're falling behind
in this big blue world J‘

40:17.958 --> 40:20.449
J‘ You got to hold on J‘

40:20.627 --> 40:22.663
J‘ Hold on J‘

40:34.683 --> 40:38.471
Male vocalist:
J‘ Down by the Riverside Motel J‘

40:39.980 --> 40:44.849
J‘ It's 10 below and falling J‘

40:45.027 --> 40:49.521
J‘ By a 99-cent store J‘

40:49.698 --> 40:54.032
J‘ She closed her eyes
and started swaying J‘

40:57.664 --> 41:02.158
J‘ But it's so hard
to dance that way J‘

41:02.336 --> 41:06.670
J‘ When it's cold
and there's no music J‘

41:08.842 --> 41:13.381
J‘ Well, your old hometown
is so far away J‘

41:13.555 --> 41:16.217
J‘ But inside your head
there's a record J‘

41:16.391 --> 41:19.633
J‘ That's playing
a song called J‘

41:19.811 --> 41:23.178
J‘ Hold on, hold on J‘

41:23.357 --> 41:26.064
J‘ Baby, you got
to hold on J‘

41:26.234 --> 41:29.226
