WEBVTT

00:01.651 --> 00:04.346
- But I don't want to go to summer camp.
- Are you kidding?

00:04.421 --> 00:06.355
You'll have a great time. Look at this one.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.914
It's a computer camp
with a theater program.

00:09.025 --> 00:12.017
<i>Ethernet by day, No, no, Nanette by night.</i>

00:12.862 --> 00:14.489
I don't want to go to camp.

00:14.564 --> 00:16.589
If the kid doesn't want to go,
don't make him go.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.691
- Yeah.
- He's 10, he's old enough to work.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.201
What?

00:20.270 --> 00:24.502
When I was your age, I spent my summers
hosing tarantulas off bananas

00:24.574 --> 00:27.042
in the back of my stepfather's truck.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.544
- What's going on?
- I'm going to camp.

00:31.381 --> 00:34.407
Okay. Morning, all. Beautiful day.

00:35.118 --> 00:38.383
- You're in a good mood.
- Well, I suppose I am.

00:38.688 --> 00:41.486
I got a little e-mail this morning
from an ex-girlfriend,

00:41.558 --> 00:43.958
who says she needs to "see" me.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.352
No kidding. I wonder if she's "knocked up. "

00:49.632 --> 00:53.124
Nobody's knocked up.
I haven't heard from her in five years.

00:53.236 --> 00:56.034
So she's bringing you a 4-year-old.

00:56.539 --> 00:58.598
Believe me, nobody's bringing anything.

00:58.708 --> 01:01.108
- Remember Jill?
- Jill the slob?

01:01.411 --> 01:04.379
Yeah, but do you remember
how hot she was?

01:04.447 --> 01:08.645
Sure, she was a tight unit,
but she left dirty dishes everywhere.

01:09.285 --> 01:13.585
Swear to God, this broad left
half eaten casseroles in the bathtub.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.918
So?

01:14.991 --> 01:18.620
With a body like that she could drink
out of the toilet if she wanted to.

01:18.728 --> 01:21.788
Wait a minute.
Isn't she the one who dumped you?

01:21.898 --> 01:23.456
Somebody dumped Charlie?

01:23.566 --> 01:26.660
Broke his little black heart.
It was pathetic.

01:27.303 --> 01:29.134
She didn't dump me.

01:29.239 --> 01:32.731
She had personal problems and moved
to Europe to, you know, find herself.

01:32.809 --> 01:34.470
- Berta?
- He wept.

01:35.979 --> 01:38.641
I did not. I felt the appropriate
amount of sadness

01:38.748 --> 01:41.308
for a good relationship
that had run its course.

01:41.417 --> 01:44.614
I had to carry him to bed
three nights in a row.

01:44.721 --> 01:47.781
I was perfectly happy
sleeping under the deck.

01:47.891 --> 01:50.724
You bring her home, you clean up after.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.955
Thank God you never get any.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074

02:20.089 --> 02:22.421
- What can I get for you?
- White wine, please.

02:22.492 --> 02:24.187
Maybe a Chablis.

02:25.428 --> 02:28.488
You know, make it a beer. Light beer.

02:29.699 --> 02:31.166
Just a beer.

02:32.669 --> 02:34.136
Another one?

02:34.504 --> 02:37.632
Might as well.
Looks like I'm getting stood up.

02:39.342 --> 02:40.809
Chicks, huh?

02:41.678 --> 02:44.010
Maybe she's got a good reason.

02:45.014 --> 02:47.175
I tell you what,
if it were any other woman,

02:47.283 --> 02:48.841
I'd have been out of here an hour ago.

02:48.952 --> 02:50.852
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

02:51.221 --> 02:54.213
This girl? This girl's something different.

02:57.393 --> 02:58.690
How so?

02:59.796 --> 03:03.232
Well, did you ever go out
with somebody who's not only

03:03.333 --> 03:06.166
great in bed
but also like a really cool friend?

03:06.236 --> 03:07.999
Yeah. Once.

03:09.572 --> 03:11.472
In fact, now that I think about it,

03:11.541 --> 03:14.032
the friendship was the best part
of our relationship.

03:14.143 --> 03:15.576
No kidding?

03:15.678 --> 03:18.169
Yeah. The sex was a little weird.

03:21.517 --> 03:24.247
We would like wrestle to get on top.

03:27.090 --> 03:30.548
She would actually get angry
if she wasn't up there.

03:31.895 --> 03:34.159
Maybe she had a good reason.

03:35.798 --> 03:36.992
Maybe.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.132
Charlie, look at me.

03:45.675 --> 03:48.701
- How do you know my name?
- It's me.

03:49.679 --> 03:51.169
Me who?

03:59.589 --> 04:00.988
No.

04:03.526 --> 04:04.823
Yes.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.158
Jill?

04:08.898 --> 04:10.160
Bill.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.031
No.

04:24.914 --> 04:27.007
We're gonna need two shots of tequila.

04:27.083 --> 04:30.246
- That's okay, I don't want to...
- They're not for you.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.248
This girl you're waiting for
really must be something.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.587
Just serve the hooch
and mind your own business.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.387
- Listen, Charlie, I know...
- Hang on.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.331
Okay, go.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.203
I know this comes as a shock to you.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.501
Please, if I had a nickel for every time

04:50.573 --> 04:52.871
a girl dumped me
and disappeared for five years

04:52.942 --> 04:55.911
and came back as a guy, I'd have a nickel.

04:56.412 --> 04:58.107
Keep them coming.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.413
I think I owe you an explanation.

05:00.516 --> 05:02.507
Who pays the nickel, by the way?

05:02.585 --> 05:04.883
Is it you or just out of some general fund?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.717
Yeah?

05:11.594 --> 05:15.587
Remember, when we broke up and I said,
"It's not you, it's me"?

05:20.536 --> 05:22.697
Yes. And I believe you now.

05:24.974 --> 05:28.569
<i>I was so mixed up and unhappy
as a woman:</i>

05:28.644 --> 05:31.442
So? I know lots of mixed up,
unhappy women.

05:31.547 --> 05:34.380
They go shopping and eat ice cream.
Did you even try that?

05:34.450 --> 05:36.611
I tried everything, but the truth is,

05:36.719 --> 05:39.381
I was always a man trapped
in a woman's body.

05:39.455 --> 05:41.616
No, I'm not buying this.

05:41.724 --> 05:44.955
If you were really a man back then,
you would've jumped at that

05:45.061 --> 05:48.224
three-way with the cocktail waitress
in Carmel.

05:48.664 --> 05:50.154
I begged you.

05:51.134 --> 05:54.570
- You haven't changed.
- I wish I could say the same.

05:55.304 --> 05:57.932
Charlie, how could I have explained it
to you back then?

05:58.007 --> 06:00.407
I couldn't even explain it to myself.

06:00.476 --> 06:03.172
Okay, now you've explained. Thank you.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.309
Nice to see you again.

06:06.416 --> 06:08.475
Good luck with the penis.

06:09.685 --> 06:10.982
Wait.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.849
A few minutes ago you said
I was a really cool friend.

06:16.259 --> 06:17.590
Yeah.

06:17.660 --> 06:21.687
Well, I'm back in LA and I'm kind of
starting a new life.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.925
- And I could really use a friend.
- Oh, boy.

06:28.604 --> 06:30.128
It's just...

06:30.840 --> 06:33.331
You know, I'm completely alone,

06:34.210 --> 06:36.178
and I'm really scared.

06:38.381 --> 06:39.643
Jeez.

06:42.018 --> 06:45.476
- It's gonna be okay, Jill.
- Bill.

06:46.255 --> 06:49.622
Yeah, Bill, whatever. It's okay.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.860
I'm still your friend.

06:52.795 --> 06:55.025
Charlie, you're the best.

06:58.101 --> 07:02.003
I wish I could've loved you the way
you deserve to be loved.

07:07.143 --> 07:10.442
Thanks for the ride, Bill.
You're a good friend.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.778
- You called me Bill.
- That's your name, lady.

07:14.784 --> 07:16.684
Just like old times, huh?

07:16.786 --> 07:19.949
Drag your drunk ass home,
take you upstairs,

07:20.022 --> 07:22.149
get you undressed and...

07:28.664 --> 07:29.995
Alan.

07:30.066 --> 07:32.364
You never met my brother, Alan, did you?

07:32.468 --> 07:35.028
No, I never met anyone
in your family, Charlie.

07:35.138 --> 07:37.231
Yeah, different rules now.

07:37.473 --> 07:41.534
Bill, this is my brother Alan.
Alan, this is my old friend, Bill.

07:41.644 --> 07:43.874
- Nice to meet you, Bill.
- Same here.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.883
I thought you were gonna hook up with
that girlfriend who wanted to "see" you.

07:49.485 --> 07:50.713
Right.

07:51.053 --> 07:55.183
Turns out she changed her "mind. "

07:57.527 --> 08:00.553
Anyway, I ran into my old friend, Bill, here.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.230
So, stood up by Jill, ran into Bill.

08:08.771 --> 08:10.329
That's funny.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.769
You have a sick sense of humor, Alan.

08:13.876 --> 08:16.674
The house is clean, I'm going home now.

08:16.879 --> 08:19.109
I'll pick that up on Monday.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.440
I'm sorry, that's mine.

08:25.688 --> 08:26.746
Hi.

08:28.191 --> 08:29.249
Hi.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.929
Okay, I'm out of here.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.140
So, Bill, you from around here?

08:47.243 --> 08:49.438
I was, but I moved away
for a couple years.

08:49.545 --> 08:51.706
I'm planning on moving back
and buying a place.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.975
Hello.

08:53.316 --> 08:56.979
Evelyn Harper, Evelyn Harper Real Estate.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.219
- Yeah, Mom's here.
- No problem, I'm drunk.

09:03.092 --> 09:05.390
I'm Bill Shraeder. I'm a friend of Charlie's.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.326
No need to apologize.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.561
So, are you interested in renting
or buying?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.430
- Buying.
- Excellent.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.125
Price range?

09:14.403 --> 09:16.871
- I'm flexible.
- I'll bet you are.

09:17.940 --> 09:20.568
- But I was talking money.
- So was I.

09:22.745 --> 09:25.908
Sexy and liquid. I like that in a man.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.750
- Nice guy. Poker buddy?
- Used to.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.982
And don't call me "buddy. "

09:40.896 --> 09:42.386
There it is.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.561
Thank you so much for showing me
the condos, Evelyn.

09:47.637 --> 09:49.434
Thank you for dinner, Bill.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.735
Thank you for dessert.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.678
Shall we go to my place
for coffee and cigars?

09:58.781 --> 10:02.080
- I don't smoke.
- You will when I'm done with you.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.113
Oh, my God.

10:09.158 --> 10:11.353
He's like half her age.

10:13.429 --> 10:15.488
Yeah. That's the problem.

10:21.237 --> 10:24.400
I'm trying, Charlie.
I'm trying to be open-minded.

10:24.473 --> 10:29.069
But our mom with a guy who's younger
than us, it's just freaking me out.

10:30.913 --> 10:32.107
Trust me, Alan.

10:32.181 --> 10:36.914
Very soon you're gonna be looking back
on this moment with fond nostalgia.

10:37.119 --> 10:39.178
- What do you mean?
- Look.

10:39.989 --> 10:42.082
- Who's this?
- This is Jill.

10:42.158 --> 10:44.183
The woman who dumped you?

10:44.293 --> 10:46.420
Get over that. Nobody dumped me.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.827
All right, I'm sorry.
Why are we looking at Jill?

10:48.931 --> 10:50.922
- Just look at it.
- Okay.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.990
She's cute.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.301
Very tall.

10:55.871 --> 10:58.499
Broad shoulders. Holy mother of God!

11:01.844 --> 11:03.778
Welcome to the Matrix.

11:06.449 --> 11:09.782
- So Jill is...
- Yep.

11:11.454 --> 11:15.823
- And you and Jill used to...
- Every chance we got.

11:17.159 --> 11:20.651
- And Mom is...
- At this very moment.

11:22.565 --> 11:24.465
Holy mother of God!

11:25.634 --> 11:27.465
What are you guys yelling about?

11:27.536 --> 11:29.470
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.009
- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes.

11:34.543 --> 11:37.535
I slept with a woman
who wanted to be a man.

11:38.180 --> 11:41.081
Or, I slept with a man in a woman's body.

11:42.218 --> 11:46.416
Or, and this is my new favorite,
and the title of my autobiography,

11:46.522 --> 11:49.286
my mom and I slept with the same dude.

11:53.696 --> 11:57.462
Excuse me, could we just
table that for now and discuss

11:57.533 --> 11:59.831
how this impacts on our mother?

11:59.902 --> 12:02.234
Why? The damage has been done.

12:02.738 --> 12:04.467
All that's left to do now is drink

12:04.540 --> 12:08.135
until the part of the brain
that creates mental pictures is dead.

12:08.210 --> 12:10.144
Charlie, stay with me.

12:10.212 --> 12:12.077
Do you think I'm gay?

12:13.149 --> 12:16.312
For God's sake, Charlie,
this is not about you.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.576
I like musical theater.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.320
Maybe all these years
I've been pathologically chasing women

12:24.393 --> 12:27.021
because I've been overcompensating.

12:28.030 --> 12:30.555
You know, I've often thought that.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.534
What? I'm agreeing with you.
What do you want to hear?

12:34.603 --> 12:37.128
I want you to tell me
that there is no chance

12:37.239 --> 12:41.733
that either of us will ever have to call
a woman I slept with "Daddy. "

12:53.889 --> 12:55.447
Jill the slob.

13:03.466 --> 13:05.263
Gadzooks!

13:09.572 --> 13:11.301
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:19.582 --> 13:21.641
So, how was your weekend?

13:22.785 --> 13:24.252
- Fine.
- Okay.

13:24.453 --> 13:27.479
Nothing exciting happening
in your world, Charlie?

13:27.590 --> 13:30.457
- Like what?
- I don't know.

13:31.460 --> 13:33.758
Go to a fun party? See a great movie?

13:33.829 --> 13:36.593
Run into an old flame with a new wick?

13:41.303 --> 13:42.861
What are the odds?

13:42.972 --> 13:46.703
One brother turns them gay,
and the other turns them guy.

13:47.176 --> 13:50.612
If you don't mind, Berta,
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:50.679 --> 13:53.341
Okay. I'll fix you something to eat.

13:54.316 --> 13:57.285
How about a sausage link
and a couple eggs?

13:57.386 --> 13:59.320
Hello? Anybody home?

13:59.388 --> 14:01.117
Oh, no.

14:02.491 --> 14:06.723
Charlie, I need to talk to you
about your friend, Bill.

14:07.062 --> 14:08.825
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

14:10.733 --> 14:15.500
You know, I'd really rather
not discuss this in front of the help.

14:16.906 --> 14:20.239
- Berta, could you give us some privacy?
- Hell, no.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.542
- Sorry.
- Okay.

14:29.552 --> 14:33.921
Bill and I shared something
very special this weekend.

14:36.258 --> 14:39.421
I realize that might be awkward for you,

14:39.528 --> 14:42.361
so I thought I'd come by to discuss it.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.957
That's nice, Mom. Isn't that nice, Alan?

14:46.402 --> 14:50.429
You're the expert, Charlie.
Is it too early to start drinking?

14:51.240 --> 14:52.969
What's that supposed to mean?

14:53.409 --> 14:58.437
Mom, how much do you know about Bill?

14:58.714 --> 15:01.877
Charlie, I have no doubt
that you two shared

15:01.951 --> 15:05.409
some sordid adventures together,
but that's the past.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.914
The only thing that matters to me now is

15:09.992 --> 15:13.325
that Bill is a handsome,
sensitive, wonderful man.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.163
Excuse me?

15:17.266 --> 15:19.826
Nothing. I'm just happy to be here.

15:21.470 --> 15:23.961
Frankly, Mom,
I'm a little uncomfortable with this.

15:24.073 --> 15:26.803
A little? I think I'm having a stroke.

15:29.311 --> 15:31.939
I knew it. You hypocrites.

15:32.448 --> 15:35.747
It's perfectly all right for you
to date younger women.

15:35.818 --> 15:39.151
But when a mature woman
gets involved with a younger man,

15:39.254 --> 15:41.745
somehow it's scandalous and immoral.

15:41.824 --> 15:44.918
- No, Mom, it's not the age.
- Well, what then?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.461
Because he's your friend?

15:47.529 --> 15:50.259
I didn't object when you dated
that friend of mine.

15:50.332 --> 15:52.266
- You what?
- One time.

15:52.334 --> 15:55.132
I was 19 and she was a very doable 42.

15:56.605 --> 16:00.234
And if you heard how she talked about
you, you wouldn't call her a friend.

16:00.342 --> 16:03.971
I've heard enough.
I'm going to continue to see Bill,

16:04.246 --> 16:07.374
and if you don't like it, that's just too bad.

16:07.483 --> 16:10.646
Wait, Mom, I thought you came here
so that we could discuss it.

16:10.719 --> 16:14.553
Please, I came here to brag.
I just needed an opening line.

16:16.825 --> 16:20.761
- Wow, she doesn't know.
- Someone's going to have to tell her.

16:20.863 --> 16:22.592
- Charlie?
- What?

16:22.698 --> 16:26.532
I'll clean your house free for a month
if you let me do it.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.172
Come on, it is a little funny.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.010
When we were dating
you never wanted me to meet your mom.

16:39.515 --> 16:42.780
All right, maybe not so much funny
as ironic.

16:43.852 --> 16:47.117
- Look, Jill. Bill.
- You're angry with me.

16:48.190 --> 16:50.886
Not angry. Not thrilled.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.620
Charlie, I never planned for this to happen.

16:53.729 --> 16:56.061
I mean, your mom and I just hit it off.

16:56.131 --> 16:59.362
She beautiful, intelligent, self-assured,

16:59.435 --> 17:02.802
and she's just exploding
with this raw sexuality.

17:04.239 --> 17:07.435
No, listen, fella,

17:07.608 --> 17:10.942
I don't know what they told you
in orientation,

17:11.946 --> 17:15.781
but, Rule Number 1, when a guy talks
like that about another guy's mom,

17:15.884 --> 17:18.284
he's likely to get his ass kicked.

17:18.387 --> 17:20.946
Come on, Charlie,
please don't get all macho on me.

17:21.056 --> 17:23.819
You couldn't take me when I was a girl.

17:24.159 --> 17:25.490
Don't change the subject.

17:25.594 --> 17:28.825
We're talking about you and my mother.
Why haven't you told her?

17:28.931 --> 17:31.422
- Told her what?
- That you're lactose intolerant.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.990
What do you think?

17:33.102 --> 17:35.229
- Stop yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling at you!

17:35.304 --> 17:36.794
Yes, you are!

17:38.774 --> 17:40.435
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.133
Look, you need to understand

17:43.212 --> 17:46.670
that no matter how much I hate
my mother, I love my mother,

17:46.782 --> 17:48.477
and I don't want to see her get hurt.

17:48.550 --> 17:52.179
So, you got to tell her before
she finds out the hard way.

17:52.287 --> 17:54.619
Or whatever way she finds out.

17:56.692 --> 17:58.353
But what if she rejects me?

17:58.460 --> 18:01.054
Welcome to the rodeo, Calamity Jane.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.191
You want to be a real man?

18:03.298 --> 18:06.529
Grab hold of those store-bought balls
and just tell the truth.

18:06.635 --> 18:08.466
Yeah, you're right.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.905
We still friends?

18:18.013 --> 18:19.480
Yeah. Sure.

18:22.317 --> 18:25.514
I'm glad.
They're made out of Teflon, you know.

18:28.590 --> 18:30.683
Okay, Rule Number 2...

18:33.495 --> 18:34.826
What'd I miss?

18:34.897 --> 18:37.195
Nothing. I don't think he's told her yet.

18:37.266 --> 18:40.099
What are you doing here?
You finished cleaning hours ago.

18:40.202 --> 18:44.434
I took a nap in the laundry room
so I'd be fresh for the big show.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.509
Okay, I think he's going for it.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.690
- Wow, that went surprisingly well.
- Damn.

19:09.698 --> 19:12.064
Wait a minute, what's he doing?

19:27.115 --> 19:28.639
There you go.

19:30.018 --> 19:31.747
See you tomorrow.

19:40.796 --> 19:42.855
Okay, we'll make a list.

19:42.965 --> 19:47.800
The pros and cons of continuing
your relationship with Bill.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.969
- Mom?
- Well, he certainly understands women.

19:55.510 --> 19:57.307
Okay, that's a pro.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.513
He used to be a woman.

20:01.216 --> 20:02.706
I'll put con.

20:05.654 --> 20:08.350
He slept with Charlie
when he was a woman.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.153
Pro. No, wait, con. Definitely con.

20:11.894 --> 20:15.990
- He knows what I like in bed.
- He knows what I like in bed.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.793
We'll call that a wash.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.197
- What's the score?
- It's about even.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.965
He's gorgeous.

20:28.577 --> 20:31.068
He can afford beach-front property

20:31.179 --> 20:35.411
and he's got a trunk full of fabulous shoes
that fit me perfectly.

20:36.184 --> 20:38.744
Don't wait up, Mommy's got a date.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.814
