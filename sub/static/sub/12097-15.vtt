He said you were a mean, hard...

that I find it hard to accept
he's having an affair.

21:39.865 --> 21:40.865
How could I ever repay you?

21:40.866 --> 21:41.866
Bread.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.367
Take the bread.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.869
Take my soup.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.870
I remember. Oh...

21:45.871 --> 21:48.372
and I owe it all to you.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.374
You helped me gain
my true self again.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.876
Goodbye.

21:53.879 --> 21:54.879
Where you going?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.881
Home, to my family.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.382
Oh, yeah? Where do they live?

21:58.383 --> 22:00.384
I don't know.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.386
But they're out there somewhere.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.888
Somewhere,

22:03.889 --> 22:05.890
there's a family of Pates
waiting for their Lester,

22:05.891 --> 22:07.391
and I'll find them.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.394
If I have to look in every city,
in every town, I'll find them,

22:10.395 --> 22:12.897
because when Lester Pate gets it
into his head to do something,

22:12.898 --> 22:14.398
he does it,

22:14.399 --> 22:17.902
because that's the kind of stuff
we Pates are made of.

22:17.903 --> 22:18.904
I think.

22:30.415 --> 22:34.419

22:37.923 --> 22:39.924
<i>Will Chester</i>
<i>get his memory back?</i>

22:39.925 --> 22:42.426
<i>And what will Jessica do</i>
<i>if he comes back?</i>

22:42.427 --> 22:44.929
<i>Now that Mary believes</i>
<i>Sally's story,</i>

22:44.930 --> 22:46.430
<i>will Burt ever get her back?</i>

22:46.431 --> 22:48.933
<i>Can Jodie put his life</i>
<i>back together</i>

22:48.934 --> 22:50.935
<i>now that</i>
<i>he can't get Carol back?</i>

22:50.936 --> 22:52.937
<i>These questions and many others</i>
<i>will be answered</i>

22:52.938 --> 22:53.939
<i>on the next episode of...</i>

23:00.445 --> 23:03.447
Soap <i>is videotaped</i>
<i>before a studio audience.</i>
