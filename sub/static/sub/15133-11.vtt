to an audience that isn't ready.

09:00.529 --> 09:02.296
It will be.
I've got all day to fix it.

09:02.331 --> 09:05.699
I've had seven cups of coffee.
Please. Please.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.935
Ahh!
Please.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.603
Okay,
I'll make you a deal.

09:09.637 --> 09:12.973
If you can fix all the problems
by 3:00 today, it's a go.

09:13.007 --> 09:14.942
Otherwise, we have to cancel.
Done.

09:14.976 --> 09:17.310
Thank you.
Do your thing.

09:17.345 --> 09:19.078
Oh, by the way.

09:19.112 --> 09:20.580
About that other
little mishap.

09:20.614 --> 09:22.114
I talked
to the lighting team.

09:22.148 --> 09:23.382
Won't happen again.

09:23.416 --> 09:25.451
I rather liked it myself.

09:25.486 --> 09:27.787
- You did?
- So did I.

09:27.821 --> 09:30.222
JFK was the man
in Marilyn's life

09:30.256 --> 09:32.525
who treated her
the most like an object.

09:32.559 --> 09:35.093
Seeing her so vulnerable
in that moment,

09:35.127 --> 09:36.361
I felt it.

09:36.395 --> 09:37.996
[Chuckles] We sold
more tickets this morning

09:38.030 --> 09:39.531
than we have
the whole of last week.

09:39.565 --> 09:42.100
We can't make Ivy do something
she's not comfortable with

09:42.134 --> 09:43.468
just to sell tickets.

09:43.503 --> 09:46.237
I'll talk to her.

09:46.271 --> 09:47.338
Hey.

09:47.373 --> 09:48.740
Yoink.

09:48.774 --> 09:50.041
I know
what you're gonna say.

09:50.075 --> 09:51.475
- You're gonna say...
- We should cancel.

09:51.510 --> 09:53.343
And you would be wrong
because...

09:53.378 --> 09:55.112
The director's delusional?

09:55.146 --> 09:56.847
You really think that
you're going to be able

09:56.882 --> 09:59.249
to fix all of that
in six hours?

09:59.283 --> 10:01.819
Yes.
I believe in miracles.

10:01.853 --> 10:04.655
And you should too.

10:04.689 --> 10:06.823
Okay.
How can I help?

10:06.857 --> 10:08.491
It's under control.
I have my list.

10:08.526 --> 10:10.727
I have my coffee.
I have everything I need.

10:10.761 --> 10:11.761
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:11.762 --> 10:13.329
I have to go talk
to the fog guy

10:13.363 --> 10:14.964
and run lines with
an eight-year-old.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.933
- Tom...
- I promise you,

10:16.967 --> 10:20.003
if we're not ready by 3:00,
I'll cancel.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.638
Where is Jimmy?
Is he not here?

10:22.672 --> 10:25.173
Uh, no.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.441
I'm a little worried
about him.

10:26.475 --> 10:28.143
When I saw him yesterday,
he seemed a little...

10:28.177 --> 10:29.244
Strung out.

10:29.278 --> 10:30.378
Look, we talked
about this

10:30.413 --> 10:32.347
when you found the coke
in his pocket last week.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.115
- Well...
- He gets high.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.651
You know that.
This is different.

10:35.685 --> 10:37.485
He's been so hyped
about the show,

10:37.520 --> 10:39.386
he hasn't slept
in three days.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.689
And he said he's afraid

10:41.723 --> 10:43.457
if everything
wasn't perfect, that...

10:43.491 --> 10:45.593
Derek would start giving you
more of my songs.

10:45.627 --> 10:47.061
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

10:47.095 --> 10:48.596
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about d...

10:48.630 --> 10:52.633
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:52.668 --> 10:56.069
Um, are we okay?

10:56.103 --> 10:58.772
Why wouldn't we be?

10:58.806 --> 11:01.207
Well, the last time we spoke,
you seemed...

11:01.241 --> 11:02.709
Pretty upset.

11:02.743 --> 11:05.378
Not in the slightest.

11:05.412 --> 11:07.513
All right, everyone.

11:07.548 --> 11:10.483
We've already lost three days,
so let's get started.

11:10.517 --> 11:11.984
Although it might be
a bit difficult

11:12.018 --> 11:14.987
to talk about new songs
without our composer.

11:15.021 --> 11:17.489
Oh, look.
Here he is.

11:17.523 --> 11:19.692
That's sweet of you
to turn up, Mr. Collins.

11:19.726 --> 11:22.227
Oh, no problem,
Mr. Wills.

11:22.261 --> 11:23.662
Okay, Richard Francis
is gonna be

11:23.697 --> 11:25.330
at our stumble-through
at 6:00.

11:25.364 --> 11:26.998
So I want as much of this
new material

11:27.032 --> 11:28.866
in the run as possible.

11:28.901 --> 11:30.534
Ana, do you want
to get over there

11:30.569 --> 11:32.236
so we can hear
the new songs, please?

11:32.270 --> 11:35.272
Have fun.

11:36.942 --> 11:39.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:45.950 --> 11:48.018
Wow. Really?

11:48.052 --> 11:49.252
You liked it that much?

11:49.286 --> 11:51.387
Oh, not just us.
Everybody did.

11:51.422 --> 11:53.423
But there's no pressure
on you at all.

11:53.457 --> 11:54.958
If you're not comfortable,
this conversation

11:54.993 --> 11:56.426
can end right now.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.661
I mean,
it's not like I haven't

11:57.695 --> 11:59.161
been naked on stage
before.

11:59.195 --> 12:00.730
I did do <i>Hair,</i>
after all.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.732
[Chuckles]
But then, everyone was naked.

12:02.766 --> 12:04.233
I was just one in a crowd.

12:04.267 --> 12:07.536
Well, nudity was authentic
to who Marilyn was.

12:07.570 --> 12:09.071
Of course,
but I wouldn't want it

12:09.106 --> 12:11.507
to overshadow the work
that I'm doing.

12:11.541 --> 12:13.242
Did you think it
made the scene better?

12:13.276 --> 12:14.510
Hmm, I'm not gonna lie.

12:14.544 --> 12:17.578
I was too mortified for you
to even process it.

12:17.613 --> 12:18.980
I wasn't.

12:19.015 --> 12:22.050
I thought it emphasized
Marilyn's vulnerability.

12:22.084 --> 12:24.853
It was shocking and real.

12:24.887 --> 12:27.221
Can I think about it
and get back to you later?

12:27.256 --> 12:28.890
Sure. Tonight.

12:30.359 --> 12:31.959
If there's
a performance tonight...

12:31.993 --> 12:33.260
There will be.
[Coughs]

12:33.294 --> 12:34.427
There will be.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.263
- [Coughing]
- Linda!

12:36.297 --> 12:39.066
Linda!

12:39.100 --> 12:41.769
Lin...

12:41.803 --> 12:42.970
Broadway!

12:43.004 --> 12:45.505
Linda!

12:45.540 --> 12:48.541
[Cheers and applause]

12:50.944 --> 12:53.079
Great.
[Sighs]

12:54.181 --> 12:56.382
Really?

12:56.416 --> 12:57.650
Mm hmm.

12:57.685 --> 12:59.318
So you want me to teach
everybody the music?

12:59.352 --> 13:00.987
Yep.

13:01.021 --> 13:02.954
See? I told you.
He loved it.

13:02.989 --> 13:05.390
He wouldn't change the show
just to punish us.

13:05.424 --> 13:07.625
He doesn't like it.

13:07.660 --> 13:09.695
How do you know?

13:09.729 --> 13:12.698
He doesn't usually
like to make a snap decision.

13:12.732 --> 13:15.133
He sits with it,
closes his eyes,

13:15.168 --> 13:17.803
draws it out for as many
painful seconds as possible.

13:17.837 --> 13:19.198
[British accent]
Sort of like this.

13:19.204 --> 13:21.706
- [Laughs]
- Hmm...

13:21.740 --> 13:24.742
Well, I'm glad
someone's having a good time.

13:24.776 --> 13:28.245
[Laughing]

13:28.279 --> 13:30.014
Shouldn't you be uptown?

13:30.048 --> 13:31.415
I heard whispers
from friends.

13:31.449 --> 13:33.450
Mm, Tom's handling it.

13:33.484 --> 13:34.784
He's the director.

13:34.819 --> 13:36.419
Mm hmm.

13:36.453 --> 13:38.254
How are you
handling everything?

13:38.288 --> 13:41.825
I'm fine.

13:41.859 --> 13:42.959
What do you mean?

13:42.993 --> 13:46.362
You just don't seem
like yourself.

13:46.396 --> 13:49.432
Ahem, yeah.
Well...

13:49.466 --> 13:53.535
I'm feeling a bit lost
at the moment.

13:53.569 --> 13:55.104
[Sighs] Don't have
the connection to the show

13:55.138 --> 13:58.974
that I had before.

13:59.008 --> 14:01.376
Look, I don't know what
happened between you and Karen,

14:01.410 --> 14:04.046
but I do know...

14:04.080 --> 14:07.281
That when Michael Swift and I
ended things,

14:07.315 --> 14:11.986
I saw the show more clearly
than I ever had,

14:12.020 --> 14:14.555
free of whatever...

14:14.589 --> 14:16.891
Distractions
had come before.

14:16.925 --> 14:20.294
And you know
what happened then.

14:20.328 --> 14:22.196
Why don't you run it?

14:22.231 --> 14:24.564
We've got a performance
for the <i>times</i> this afternoon.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.800
So? Run it now,
before they get here.

14:26.834 --> 14:30.837
Maybe it'll be good for you.
Maybe you'll see something new.

14:32.907 --> 14:34.241
Kyle.

14:34.275 --> 14:37.277
Yeah?

14:38.612 --> 14:40.980
We're gonna run the show.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.181
Right now?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.216
Yeah.
Start to finish.

14:59.929 --> 15:03.064
Well, that...
Hey, was brilliant.

15:03.846 --> 15:05.147
Really.

15:05.244 --> 15:06.678
All of you,
it's in great shape.

15:07.768 --> 15:09.903
All the new diva stuff
really works.

15:09.927 --> 15:11.461
Kyle, Jimmy, I've got
a couple of thoughts, though.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.764
Okay, so I think Amanda should
take "E" for the first time

15:14.798 --> 15:17.199
before the video for
I'm not sorry instead of after.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.968
I think that will add
to the lachapelle,

15:19.002 --> 15:20.769
no-holds-barred thing
we're going for, yeah?

15:20.803 --> 15:22.283
- I like that a lot.
- Oh, and, Jimmy,

15:22.305 --> 15:25.574
can you reprise <i>Voice in a dream</i>
at the end of act one?

15:25.608 --> 15:26.775
Yeah,
we can do that easy.

15:26.809 --> 15:27.809
Okay, great.
Thanks.

15:27.810 --> 15:29.611
Um, all right,
I've got an idea

15:29.645 --> 15:30.880
for the beginning as well.

15:30.914 --> 15:32.780
Um... all right.

15:32.814 --> 15:34.615
Um, I want to try
and tell the story

15:34.649 --> 15:36.117
in flashback,
all right?

15:36.151 --> 15:38.486
A bit like <i>Sunset boulevard</i>
or <i>All about Eve.</i>

15:38.520 --> 15:40.288
What do you mean?

15:40.322 --> 15:42.322
Well, you know, it's
like classic murder mystery,

15:42.324 --> 15:43.591
where you begin
with the ending.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.793
So, uh,
the diva's in disgrace.

15:45.827 --> 15:47.195
Amanda's dropped
her alter ego.

15:47.229 --> 15:49.596
She's already succeeded
just as herself.

15:49.630 --> 15:52.232
Won't that spoil
the ending?

15:52.267 --> 15:54.101
No, it doesn't spoil it.
It sets it up.

15:54.135 --> 15:55.269
What are you talking about?

15:55.303 --> 15:57.104
Um, okay.
You, come with me.

15:57.138 --> 15:59.106
No, no. You.
Come on, let's go.

15:59.140 --> 16:02.309
All right, the diva...
Just here.

16:02.343 --> 16:04.277
Goes to Amanda's concert.
All right?

16:04.311 --> 16:07.313
She's just a face
in the crowd.

16:07.347 --> 16:10.016
She moves forward...

16:10.050 --> 16:11.984
Among the throng.
Come on, throng.

16:12.019 --> 16:13.319
Join us.
All right.

16:13.353 --> 16:15.121
She comes down to the front,
all right?

16:15.155 --> 16:16.789
Okay, wait there.

16:16.823 --> 16:19.825
She raises the gun.

16:22.561 --> 16:24.829
[Snaps fingers]
Bang.

16:24.863 --> 16:26.864
Oh, but who did she kill?
Huh?

16:26.899 --> 16:28.666
Jesse? Amanda?
Someone else?

16:28.700 --> 16:29.834
That question
would give away everything.

16:29.868 --> 16:32.537
Yeah, we don't see you.

16:32.571 --> 16:34.872
Diva's the only person
on stage.

16:34.907 --> 16:36.506
She's the only voice
that we hear.

16:36.541 --> 16:37.641
Ana, you still got the gun

16:37.675 --> 16:39.109
from the end
of the last scene, right?

16:39.144 --> 16:40.544
- Yeah.
- All right, Blake,

16:40.578 --> 16:43.013
bring up the cue for the end
of act 2, scene 11, please.

16:43.048 --> 16:46.050
Got it.

16:50.922 --> 16:54.057
Okay... sing the first
few lines, please.

16:54.091 --> 16:55.325
[Piano playing]

16:55.359 --> 16:57.726
No, a cappella, please.

[Chuckles]
Yeah.

17:39.067 --> 17:42.768
[Applause]

17:42.803 --> 17:44.337
That's my song.

17:44.372 --> 17:47.273
Yeah, we'll hear you sing it
in a few scenes' time.

17:47.308 --> 17:49.109
If the diva's
already sung it,

17:49.143 --> 17:51.511
it's not gonna feel
like it's her song.

17:51.545 --> 17:53.013
Damn it, Derek...

17:53.047 --> 17:55.048
I worked my ass off
for 72 hours

17:55.082 --> 17:56.348
so that you wouldn't
do this.

17:56.383 --> 17:58.850
- I didn't sleep!
- Yeah, obviously.

17:58.885 --> 18:01.186
And when you come down
off whatever it is you're on,

18:01.221 --> 18:03.722
you'll see
this really works.

18:03.756 --> 18:06.025
Derek, that's
my favorite song.

18:06.059 --> 18:07.859
It's my character's anthem.

18:07.894 --> 18:09.228
Don't give it to Ana.

18:09.262 --> 18:12.263
I just did.

18:13.965 --> 18:16.534
Little Norma Jeane
is off book, finally.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.969
[Chuckles]
Kids. Never again.

18:19.004 --> 18:21.705
We fixed the fog.
Never again.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.007
[Chuckles]

18:23.042 --> 18:24.542
That's everything
except intermission, right?

18:24.576 --> 18:25.776
They're saying
they're ready.

18:25.777 --> 18:26.944
Go!

18:31.182 --> 18:33.584
- Where's the plane?
- I'm finding out.

18:35.420 --> 18:36.921
How long still?

18:38.690 --> 18:40.758
It's twice as long
as it should be.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.993
Why couldn't Marilyn
have taken a bus?

18:43.028 --> 18:46.296
You dreamt this one up
all on your own.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.198
It's 3:00.
We need to make the call.

18:48.232 --> 18:49.232
What's the word?

18:49.267 --> 18:50.500
It's not gonna happen.

18:50.535 --> 18:53.070
She means postponing
isn't gonna happen,

18:53.104 --> 18:54.971
'cause we're ready.
We ran everything.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.074
It's all working.
All of it.

18:57.108 --> 19:01.410
See? The plane.

19:01.445 --> 19:02.811
[Imitating tattoo]
Da plane.

19:02.845 --> 19:04.313
Is the intermission down?

19:04.347 --> 19:06.615
15 minutes,
as advertised.

19:06.649 --> 19:07.849
Excellent.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.918
Well, I'll call
the box office

19:09.953 --> 19:13.255
and tell them that the preview
is on for tonight.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.690
Good work, everybody.

19:14.724 --> 19:17.792
I have to say, I didn't think
it was possible.

19:21.630 --> 19:23.931
Run it again.
Now.

19:23.966 --> 19:25.800
[Inhales sharply]

19:25.834 --> 19:28.269
I see you.
I see you.

19:28.304 --> 19:30.871
Let's reset from the top
of intermission.

19:30.906 --> 19:32.707
Richard's already
written the article.

19:32.741 --> 19:34.508
He just wants to see
a stumble-through

19:34.542 --> 19:36.009
before he sends it out.

19:36.043 --> 19:38.945
You sure now is the time
to make a structural change?

19:38.980 --> 19:40.547
Yeah, well, if it takes
the show from just being

19:40.582 --> 19:43.150
another <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> clone
into something more iconic,

19:43.184 --> 19:45.119
then yes.

19:45.153 --> 19:46.453
We made a deal.

19:46.488 --> 19:48.489
We agreed to give
the diva more songs.

19:48.523 --> 19:50.323
That is it.
And that's what we did.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.825
Okay, this is how
development works, Jimmy.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.328
You keep making changes
until you get it right.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.729
To make the show better,
fine.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.831
Because the director's
mad at his star

19:58.865 --> 20:00.666
for turning him down?
Not fine.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.668
- Jimmy.
- Tell Scott the truth.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.742
Huh? You're blowing this up
because of me and Karen.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.304
You are punishing us!

20:06.339 --> 20:09.407
I left Broadway
for your little show, all right?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.243
I should be at
my first preview right now.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.878
Instead, I'm back
in High School with you.

20:13.912 --> 20:17.482
If I punished anyone,
it's myself.

20:17.517 --> 20:20.485
This is my first show
as artistic director

20:20.520 --> 20:22.386
of Manhattan theatre
workshop.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.655
I took the biggest risk here
on all three of you.

20:24.689 --> 20:27.057
- Oh, come on.
- All three of you!

20:27.091 --> 20:29.926
So, please,
pull yourselves together

20:29.961 --> 20:31.762
and do the run-through
for <i>the New York Times.</i>

20:31.763 --> 20:33.164
After that,
you can fight all you want.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.398
Just do it far from here.

20:34.432 --> 20:35.399
We're not gonna do
the new beginning.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.500
- Yeah, we are.
- Hey. Hey.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.536
Kyle...

20:39.570 --> 20:41.671
What do you think?

20:46.910 --> 20:49.945
Derek's right.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.348
I'm sorry.
It's better.

20:53.383 --> 20:54.744
Have a good run-through,
gentlemen.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.786
I'll see you
on the other side.

21:12.377 --> 21:15.044
Dude, what the hell was that before, man?

21:15.078 --> 21:17.580
We're supposed to be a team.

21:17.615 --> 21:19.248
Yeah.
Yeah, we're a team.

21:19.282 --> 21:21.651
Except you don't listen
to anything I say.

21:21.685 --> 21:23.285
You just shoot it down,
and that's it.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.722
When the idea's wrong,
yes, then I do.

21:25.756 --> 21:26.756
You know something?

21:26.790 --> 21:30.092
Maybe Derek's right.

21:30.127 --> 21:32.460
Maybe it's you who can't
see the show anymore.

21:32.495 --> 21:35.163
Hey, I see the show
perfectly.

21:35.197 --> 21:37.933
I see Derek changing it

21:37.967 --> 21:40.035
because he is jealous
of me and Karen.

21:40.069 --> 21:44.272
Which, if we're
gonna be really honest here,

21:44.306 --> 21:47.174
so are you.

21:47.208 --> 21:50.177
I know this might be
really hard for you to believe,

21:50.211 --> 21:52.279
but I'm good at this now.

21:52.313 --> 21:54.214
It's the right idea.

21:54.249 --> 21:57.451
So you can bitch all you want.
I don't care anymore.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.731
I just don't get it.
You have to go on tonight.

22:11.766 --> 22:13.332
It's not necessarily me.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.901
It could be
any of the other swings.

22:14.936 --> 22:16.302
Tristan, Dexter, Jordon...

22:16.336 --> 22:17.370
Yeah, but none of them

22:17.404 --> 22:19.204
can sing or dance
as well as you.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.319
Please,
we don't even know

22:20.339 --> 22:21.807
if there's gonna be
a show tonight.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.809
Or what I'll be wearing
if there is one.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.310
Hey, hey!

22:25.344 --> 22:27.813
You promise me you're not
actually considering that.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.548
My mom said
I should go for it

22:29.583 --> 22:30.983
"while I'm still
young enough."

22:31.017 --> 22:33.485
You are giving
an amazing performance.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.652
If you take
your clothes off,

22:34.687 --> 22:36.220
that's all people
are gonna remember.

22:36.254 --> 22:39.057
Trust me.
I was in <i>take me out.</i>

22:39.091 --> 22:40.925
Do you remember the plot?
[Laughing]

22:40.960 --> 22:43.661
I remember penis.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.029
I see your point.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.230
Everyone saw my point.

22:46.264 --> 22:49.033
And that is all anyone
talked about.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.001
I mean, to this day,
you Google "Sam Strickland,"

22:51.035 --> 22:52.435
you know the first thing
that comes up?

22:52.470 --> 22:54.738
Yeah, but this
is just a small moment,

22:54.772 --> 22:57.140
not a 15-minute
shower scene.

22:57.174 --> 22:59.610
It's just to show
how vulnerable Marilyn was.

22:59.644 --> 23:01.979
They do not need
to see you naked

23:02.013 --> 23:04.380
to feel you naked.

23:04.415 --> 23:05.849
You're a great actress.

23:05.883 --> 23:07.683
You could play vulnerable
with a bag over your head.

23:07.718 --> 23:09.085
[Cell phone ringing]
Oh...

23:09.119 --> 23:10.753
This is my agent.

23:10.787 --> 23:13.288
I might actually
be going on tonight.

23:13.323 --> 23:18.360
Promise me you're gonna tell Tom
you're not doing it.

23:18.394 --> 23:19.795
Hello?

23:19.830 --> 23:22.297
Okay, Richard, we're very much
in a state of flux here,

23:22.332 --> 23:23.965
and we only
changed the beginning

23:24.000 --> 23:25.100
about half an hour ago,

23:25.134 --> 23:27.102
but I think you'll like
what you see.

23:27.136 --> 23:28.937
Is everyone ready?

23:28.971 --> 23:30.772
Yeah!
[All cheer]

23:30.806 --> 23:33.274
[Applause]

23:33.308 --> 23:35.243
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay, places.

23:37.947 --> 23:39.212
I'm sorry.

23:39.247 --> 23:40.981
I didn't mean to take
another one of your songs.

23:41.016 --> 23:42.282
It's fine.

23:42.316 --> 23:44.584
It was all Derek anyway,
not you.

23:44.619 --> 23:46.987
Once he calms down,
it'll go back.

23:47.022 --> 23:48.722
What do you mean?

23:48.757 --> 23:49.890
I think he only
gave you that song

23:49.924 --> 23:52.726
'cause he was pissed
at me.

23:52.761 --> 23:55.094
Are you kidding?

23:55.129 --> 23:57.496
Wow.

23:57.531 --> 24:00.533
Thanks for
believing in me.

24:03.804 --> 24:05.437
We done with her?

24:05.472 --> 24:06.806
Hey.
Hi.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.201
Where's Sam?
I need to talk to him.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.909
I don't think
he wants to talk to you.

24:09.943 --> 24:11.843
He knows.

24:11.878 --> 24:14.412
- Scale of one to ten?
- Pissed.

24:14.446 --> 24:16.114
This has nothing to do
with us.

24:16.149 --> 24:17.315
Jordon's been in
the company longer.

24:17.349 --> 24:18.684
I had to put him on first.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.819
Ivy, they need you
in here.

24:20.853 --> 24:22.353
You're gonna be great
tonight.

24:22.388 --> 24:24.690
What did you decide?
I'm still thinking.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.624
That's okay, right?

24:26.659 --> 24:28.993
Of course.
Tell Linda when you know.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.028
Okay.

24:31.063 --> 24:32.184
We got
the intermission down,

24:32.197 --> 24:33.764
but it's still running long.

24:33.799 --> 24:35.632
Well, maybe
I could quickly write

24:35.667 --> 24:36.967
a really long
entr'acte?

24:37.002 --> 24:38.635
And orchestrate it,
give it to the musicians,

24:38.670 --> 24:39.804
and have them learn it?

24:39.838 --> 24:42.339
Did I say that out loud?

24:42.373 --> 24:44.407
[Chuckles]

24:44.441 --> 24:46.976
Oh, my God.
You were so right.

24:47.011 --> 24:49.145
Ugh. As much as I never
tire of hearing that,

24:49.180 --> 24:50.980
at the moment,
I don't care.

24:51.015 --> 24:54.550
I just want this to be good,
for both of us.

24:54.585 --> 24:56.485
It's just I've never
done this before.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.287
As a composer,
I know I'm good.

24:58.322 --> 25:01.190
But as a director...
I don't have that yet.

25:01.224 --> 25:03.558
Shut up a second.
I think I have an idea...

25:03.593 --> 25:05.694
To shorten the intermission.

25:05.729 --> 25:07.730
If it works.

25:07.764 --> 25:08.797
I'll do anything.

25:08.832 --> 25:10.833
Can I break them?

25:12.602 --> 25:16.470
Ten more minutes.

25:16.504 --> 25:17.571
Okay.

25:17.606 --> 25:20.842
[Speaking indistinctly]

25:20.876 --> 25:22.309
House lights up,
and then...

25:22.344 --> 25:24.411
You guys come with me,
all the way up here.

25:24.446 --> 25:25.512
And then you're gonna
come crawling.

25:25.547 --> 25:26.814
You're gonna do
your crawling thing.

25:26.849 --> 25:28.515
And then the crawling
comes down.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.218
That's good,
that's good.

25:30.252 --> 25:31.852
"Whaaat?"

25:31.886 --> 25:33.854
[Laughs]
Sunglasses.

25:33.888 --> 25:35.222
Hello, Marlon Brando.

25:35.256 --> 25:36.389
And you're gonna
start singing.

25:36.423 --> 25:38.091
We'll see them
coming out of the pit.

25:38.126 --> 25:40.927
Julia Houston...
Your idea.

25:40.962 --> 25:42.729
So that's it.

25:42.764 --> 25:45.232
[Applause]
Stand by, lights and sound.

25:45.266 --> 25:46.733
60 seconds.

25:46.767 --> 25:49.769
[Applause continues]

26:01.081 --> 26:02.081
[Applause fades]

26:02.082 --> 26:05.083
[Light orchestral music]

26:11.670 --> 26:12.739
You better get some special.

26:12.765 --> 26:14.571
Listen, I'm gonna try to
get this out tonight.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.947
I'm gonna head uptown
with you.

26:15.982 --> 26:18.049
- I got a date I'm late for.
- Tell her I said hi.

26:18.084 --> 26:19.383
Thank her for her help.

26:19.418 --> 26:21.720
Hey, you said you
wouldn't let it happen.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.888
- What?
- Today.

26:23.923 --> 26:25.389
I worried Derek
would take my songs away

26:25.424 --> 26:26.591
because he's mad at me.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.759
You said you wouldn't
let it happen.

26:27.793 --> 26:29.494
What changed?

26:29.528 --> 26:30.929
You know,
this whole time,

26:30.963 --> 26:33.030
I have been telling myself
that it's okay

26:33.064 --> 26:35.365
to just hang around
and accept whatever I got,

26:35.399 --> 26:37.868
'cause you're the star
and I'm your friend.

26:37.902 --> 26:40.004
I just never thought
you felt that way too.

26:40.038 --> 26:42.706
That's the thing.
I'm not the star anymore, am I?

26:42.741 --> 26:44.908
It's not my fault
that Derek thinks I'm talented

26:44.943 --> 26:46.304
and wants to use me
in more things.

26:46.310 --> 26:47.511
This isn't about talent.

26:47.545 --> 26:49.045
Maybe not for you.

26:49.079 --> 26:51.180
Guess you should have
slept with Derek

26:51.214 --> 26:54.216
when you had the chance.

26:57.721 --> 27:00.222
Hey, sorry I'm late.

27:00.257 --> 27:02.291
You got here just in time
to see the brand-new beginning

27:02.325 --> 27:05.426
to act two, courtesy of
your old friend, Julia Houston.

27:05.461 --> 27:06.628
Transition troubles?

27:06.663 --> 27:08.196
Ah, couldn't get
a plane on stage.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.431
Ah, that's the best part
about downtown theatre.

27:10.466 --> 27:12.100
There are no planes.

27:12.135 --> 27:13.802
Except for ones
made by dancers.

27:13.836 --> 27:15.704
- Oh.
- Oh, God, that is so Derek.

27:15.738 --> 27:17.472
[Chuckles] Yeah.

27:17.506 --> 27:19.107
Oh, God,
I hope this works.

27:19.142 --> 27:21.042
Here we go.

27:21.076 --> 27:24.545
The challenge for the actor
is to use sense memory

27:24.579 --> 27:26.613

38:27.131 --> 38:29.099
were the theatrical events
of the season!

38:29.133 --> 38:31.000
No! You said <i>Hit list</i>

38:31.035 --> 38:32.802
was the theatrical event
of the season.

38:32.837 --> 38:35.303
You said
<i>Bombshell</i> was the past.

38:35.338 --> 38:37.539
Would you rather I didn't
write about <i>Bombshell</i> at all?

38:37.573 --> 38:39.441
I have spent a long time
getting this thing

38:39.475 --> 38:41.777
where it needed to be,
and now you do this?

38:41.811 --> 38:43.812
- Eileen...
- Richard,

38:43.847 --> 38:46.314
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

38:46.349 --> 38:50.351
Would you just leave?

39:04.166 --> 39:06.566
I'm sorry.
I am a dick.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.534
Yeah, you are.

39:08.569 --> 39:10.070
Dude, I'm really sorry,
okay?

39:10.104 --> 39:13.640
Look, I know I can be
a jerk sometimes, but...

39:13.674 --> 39:15.708
I mean, everything,
all this...

39:15.743 --> 39:18.044
It's 'cause of you.

39:18.079 --> 39:20.647
You got us here.

39:20.681 --> 39:21.748
Dude, I can't do this
without you.

39:21.782 --> 39:23.983
You know that.

39:24.017 --> 39:28.654
Besides, we're edgy
and occasionally brilliant.

39:28.688 --> 39:30.555
I'm brilliant all the time.
You're the occasional half.

39:30.590 --> 39:33.225
[Laughs]

39:38.463 --> 39:40.865
Go have some fun, man.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.100
You earned it.

39:50.810 --> 39:54.077
About before...

39:54.112 --> 39:56.713
This isn't just right now
for me.

39:56.747 --> 39:58.148
What I feel with you...

39:58.183 --> 40:01.952
I-I want to be with you
for a long time.

40:01.986 --> 40:03.026
You have to open up to me.

40:03.054 --> 40:07.424
I... I can't do this,
otherwise.

40:07.458 --> 40:09.793
You have to let me know
who you are.

40:09.827 --> 40:13.129
♪ ♪

40:13.163 --> 40:17.033
I'm sorry.

40:20.637 --> 40:23.806
I'm sorry too.

40:30.146 --> 40:35.116
[Crowd chatter]

40:35.151 --> 40:36.818
Excuse me.

40:36.853 --> 40:38.887
Do you know Jimmy Collins?

40:38.921 --> 40:41.622
Uh, yeah.
He just left.

40:41.657 --> 40:44.058
Damn.

40:44.092 --> 40:45.159
I heard about the show.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.961
I wanted to come
congratulate him.

40:46.995 --> 40:48.329
How do you know Jimmy?

40:48.363 --> 40:51.465
My name's Adam.
I'm... an old friend of his.

40:51.499 --> 40:55.435
Nice to meet you,
old friend.

40:55.470 --> 41:00.406
God, I came all the way
up here for nothin', huh?

41:00.440 --> 41:03.442
Well, uh, maybe
I'll see you around.

41:15.521 --> 41:17.655
What are you doing here?

41:17.690 --> 41:19.958
You didn't call
last night.

41:19.993 --> 41:21.593
I didn't call tonight,
either,

41:21.627 --> 41:23.595
and here you are.

41:25.164 --> 41:29.701
Well, I wanted
to congratulate you in person.

41:29.735 --> 41:33.771
How'd you know
it went well?

41:33.805 --> 41:35.373
You wouldn't have
let it be otherwise.

41:35.407 --> 41:38.309
[Chuckles]

41:38.343 --> 41:40.511
[Sighs]

41:40.545 --> 41:43.480
This thing between us...

41:43.515 --> 41:44.982
It's just casual, right?

41:45.017 --> 41:47.117
[Scoffs]
Yeah.

41:47.151 --> 41:50.387
Here, check this out.

41:50.421 --> 41:51.888
Set my alarm.

41:51.923 --> 41:54.924
