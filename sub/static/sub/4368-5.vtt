00:03.370 --> 00:05.907
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:08.113
<i>The government has a secret system,</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.175 --> 00:11.816
<i>a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:16.751
<i>I designed The Machine to detect acts
of terror but it sees everything,</i>

00:16.917 --> 00:20.194
<i>violent crimes involving
ordinary people.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:23.028
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.567
<i>We don't.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:29.899
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.701
<i>You'll never find us,</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:37.178
<i>but victim or perpetrator,
if your number's up, we'll find you.</i>

00:50.517 --> 00:53.589
- Open the door!
- That's a human liver.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.462
We have to get that to City General.
A patient's life depends on it.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.728
Our boss's life depends on it more.

01:03.864 --> 01:07.107
Drop the gun,
or your friends gonna get it.

01:16.643 --> 01:18.452
Here's your liver.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.387
Look, Belinda,
or whatever your name is...

01:22.916 --> 01:25.226
...you just saved my life.
How can I ever possibly...

01:25.419 --> 01:27.456
All done here, Finch.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.760
Not to be a stickler about etiquette,
Ms. Shaw,

01:29.923 --> 01:32.665
but I believe that Mr. Mathers
was in the midst of thanking you.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.636
You paid me to save him,
not listen to him talk.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.106
And while your combat skills
are impressive,

01:38.265 --> 01:41.474
your bedside manner still leaves
a little something to be desired.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.239
I was thinking you might stop by

01:43.403 --> 01:45.508
and we could discuss it
over a nice cup of tea.

01:45.672 --> 01:49.484
Well, as fun as that sounds, Finch,
I'll pass.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.967
I don't like meeting out in the open
like this, Yogorov.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.265
Relax, Simmons.

02:09.429 --> 02:12.433
This place was on the map
you gave us. You see any cameras?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.810
- So, Terney?
- Yeah.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.568
What's the status
on our joint operation?

02:16.592 --> 02:18.469
Everything's in place.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.341
<i>Our part's good to go.</i>

02:20.507 --> 02:22.544
<i>We just need you to arrange
the meeting.</i>

02:22.709 --> 02:25.553
No problem. We'll get all the players
in one room.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.214
One very secure room.

02:29.049 --> 02:33.828
If our boss is gonna be involved,
this is gonna be airtight.

02:52.806 --> 02:56.754
John, one of these days,
I'm just gonna shoot you.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.421
I get that a lot.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.892
Busted, huh?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.534
Finch and I have known about
your side project for a while.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.539
From what we've seen,

03:15.696 --> 03:19.200
you've got enough to bring down
half the organization.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.108
You could bust them,
make deals to take down the rest.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.775
Special Agent Donnelly tried that.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.514
But HR rebuilt itself from ashes
because we didn't cut off the head.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.792
If we had,
Cal might still be alive.

03:36.950 --> 03:40.090
I'm playing by different rules now.

03:41.388 --> 03:47.031
No deals and I won't make a move
until I can bring down the boss.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.970
They're running some joint operation
with the Russians.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.236
If I can just get eyes
on that meeting,

03:53.400 --> 03:56.040
I might finally ID the head of HR.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.580
- Need help?
- No.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.983
But if I do,
you'll be my first call.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.392
Finch, I thought you said
we had a new number.

04:17.557 --> 04:21.834
We do, but this one doesn't match
any Social Security number on record.

04:21.995 --> 04:27.343
The nine digits in question are a
USCIS alien registration number.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.446
Green card number.
We're looking for an immigrant.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.950
Specifically, Ms. Genrika Zhirova
of Solntsevo, Russia.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.850
Information on Ms. Zhirova
is a little hard to come by.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.854
She has virtually
no digital footprint.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.822
All I have so far
is a last known address.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.791
It's a housing project
in the South Bronx.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.470
I can't even find a photo
of the woman.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.762
Then let's go have a look at her.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.269
Agent Stone,
Immigration and Customs.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.709
I'm looking for Genrika Zhirova.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.877
Genrika!

05:16.283 --> 05:18.889
No eyes on the target yet
but I see drugs at her place.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.998
<i>Could have something to do
with why we're here.</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:22.224
Rough neighborhood.

05:22.389 --> 05:26.064
Whatever this woman's into,
I got a feeling it's gonna get messy.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.876
- Can I help you?
- You're Genrika?

05:34.901 --> 05:38.246
Gen, nobody calls me Genrika.

05:38.405 --> 05:42.876
- Are your parents here?
- My mom's in prison in Russia.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.080
I never knew my dad.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.279
I came here a few years ago
to live with my grandfather.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.560
- And where is he?
- Cemetery.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.357
He died eight months ago.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.368
Shouldn't you guys
already know this stuff?

05:58.558 --> 06:00.936
- So now you live with...
- Vadim.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.096
We're, like, third cousin
or something.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.936
He's supposed to be
taking care of me now.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.204
Which means he gets an extra
200 a month and a free place to live.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.247
They should pay me twice that
to put up with her.

06:11.404 --> 06:15.546
Always sneaking around,
taking pictures.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.849
Crazy little girl thinks she's a spy.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.787
I'm just practicing for my career.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.622
- Career doing what?
- International espionage.

06:26.086 --> 06:30.057
- What's this about?
- Just a routine check.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.260
Routine, my ass.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.234
Is there a problem
with my immigration status?

06:34.394 --> 06:37.238
- No. I...
- Why'd they send you?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.274
Agent Cross normally handles my case.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.076
There is no Agent Cross.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.054
Look, uh...
do you need any help here?

06:57.217 --> 07:00.130
I'm fine, but you're making me
late for school.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.295
Ms. Shaw's conversation
with Ms. Zhirova

07:06.459 --> 07:09.668
was, if not harmonious,
at least illuminating.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.672
Four years ago,
her mother was in prison

07:11.831 --> 07:14.004
for protesting
the Putin administration.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.579
So her grandfather brought
Gen here to live with him.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.012
<i>Now she's all alone.</i>

07:19.172 --> 07:21.448
Not exactly the safest place
for a kid.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.610
And cousin Vadim's
no Suzy Homemaker.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.850
<i>Well, whatever's going on,
I doubt this girl's the perpetrator.</i>

07:28.014 --> 07:30.620
I wouldn't be surprised if the recent
changes in her circumstances

07:30.784 --> 07:32.422
have something to do with the threat.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.623
<i>Perhaps, Ms. Shaw,
had you been a touch more solicitous</i>

07:35.789 --> 07:37.269
<i>when asking her if she needed help...</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:38.462
What?
I asked, she said no.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.798
If you ask me,
the kid can take care of her...

07:44.831 --> 07:46.071
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

07:46.199 --> 07:48.042
<i>You're not gonna
believe this, Finch.</i>

07:48.201 --> 07:50.147
Shaw just got made
by a ten-year-old.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.783
What kind of a weird-ass kid
uses counter-surveillance tactics?

07:52.807 --> 07:54.778
I got it from here.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.541
But I think you
freaked her out a little.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.819
It's mutual.
I'll recon her building.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.285
Mr. Reese,
we need to have a talk

08:02.449 --> 08:03.894
<i>about Ms. Shaw.
- Uh...</i>

08:04.050 --> 08:05.893
Don't worry, I've got us up
on a private line.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.362
Look, it won't do to save
this little girl's life

08:08.521 --> 08:10.728
only to have her scared to death
by Ms. Shaw.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.837
Perhaps it would be best if we kept
her at arm's length from Ms. Zhirova.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.564
<i>Fine with me,
I hate kids.</i>

08:17.297 --> 08:19.334
- Ms. Shaw?
- What, Finch?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.570
You think I didn't bug your office?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.411
We've got trouble, Finch.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.659
Hey! Get her!

08:53.099 --> 08:55.943
Whoever this girl is, Finch,
she has a very grown-up problem.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.274
Come on.

09:01.608 --> 09:04.282
<i>- 911 emergency.
- I just saw an accident.</i>

09:04.444 --> 09:07.891
<i>A tire blew and the driver
lost control. Please send someone.</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:10.289
I need an ETA on that bus!

09:10.450 --> 09:13.727
And get a back brace ready,
just in case!

09:24.230 --> 09:27.234
- The top's completely collapsed.
- I'll try to get to the driver.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.383
- Driver's DOA.
- Hello?

09:36.109 --> 09:39.113
I've got a 10-45.
Someone's alive in there.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.885
- I can't see 'em.
- I'll check the other side.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.999
Hey, there.
Are you hurt?

09:52.158 --> 09:56.231
I don't think so.
Is my dad okay?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.507
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Sameen.

10:01.668 --> 10:05.172
Okay, Sameen, hang on, kiddo.
I'm coming to you, okay?

10:11.511 --> 10:14.185
Well, Finch, so much for keeping me
away from the kid.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.792
Ms. Zhirova. Is she safe?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.989
For now. But I don't think
our tangos have given up.

10:18.013 --> 10:20.955
Me either.
What's your 20?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.498
Sub-basement.
A few floors down.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.364
Hold your position.
I'm on my way.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.028
<i>Any idea what this is about?</i>

10:29.796 --> 10:32.196
Do you know who those men were
or why they tried to grab you?

10:32.220 --> 10:34.200
Probably because I'm a spy.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.940
- She doesn't know.
- So we have no idea who's after her?

10:40.106 --> 10:42.677
The guy giving orders
had a tremor in his hand.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.344
<i>Could be Parkinson's.</i>

10:44.511 --> 10:46.991
It's a rare enough condition.
It might help us to identify him.

10:47.015 --> 10:49.521
All right, John, I'll meet you
at the northeast comer.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.963
No, please stay put, Ms. Shaw.
Mr. Reese will come to you.

10:51.987 --> 10:55.030
<i>Your job is to protect
Ms. Zhirova at all costs.</i>

10:55.188 --> 10:56.667
Sir, yes, sir.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.235
I thought you might be a robot.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.139
No hits for Parkinson's
in the database

11:11.304 --> 11:13.984
<i>but if you're loocking for bad guys,
you've gone to the right place.</i>

11:14.008 --> 11:17.716
- Your girl lives in an impact zone.
- Well, that doesn't sound good.

11:17.877 --> 11:21.188
Her address is in a blind spot where
funding for Domain Awareness ran out.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.588
Criminals like to go
where the cameras aren't.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.321
No sign of our friend in the suit.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.727
But she's on another one
of her secret calls.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.892
- She's definitely up to something.
- Find out <i>what.</i>

11:33.526 --> 11:35.335
Gotta go.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.626
Carter, where were you last night?

11:41.789 --> 11:43.989
A bunch of us went out for drinks.
I left you a message.

11:44.013 --> 11:46.431
New gun, Laskey?

11:47.907 --> 11:52.413
Like it? I just bought it
last weekend. Gun show in Jersey.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.082
So you brought it
across state lines illegally?

11:55.248 --> 11:58.024
You do know
that every gun in New York

11:58.184 --> 12:00.289
has to have a ballistics test
on file, right?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.037
Nice.

12:12.232 --> 12:16.271
<i>- You guys have the girl yet?
- We're closing in but she has help.</i>

12:22.275 --> 12:24.585
- What's your name?
- Not important.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.384
Well, who are you?
Why are you here?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.181
How'd you know
I was gonna be in trouble?

12:30.205 --> 12:33.062
- How's it going, John?
- Still clearing our extraction route...

12:33.219 --> 12:35.563
<i>same as I was two minutes ago.</i>

12:36.623 --> 12:40.435
Who's John?
Is he your friend?

12:42.428 --> 12:46.740
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No. He's a co-worker.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.812
Co-worker.
So this is your job?

12:49.969 --> 12:52.950
What are you?
Like, Spec Ops or something?

12:54.307 --> 12:58.653
Oh, man!
What agency do you work for?

12:58.811 --> 13:02.486
CIA? NSA? INSCOM?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.524
Why would a big agency like that
care what happens to me?

13:06.686 --> 13:07.824
We're not a big agency.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.797
Why would a small agency care
what happens to me?

13:10.957 --> 13:13.198
We're not any agency.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.307
We're just a...
I don't even know what we are.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.064
To be honest,
I'm only in it for the dog.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.611
You guys have a dog?

13:21.868 --> 13:23.142
<i>No sign of them here.</i>

13:23.336 --> 13:24.644
Shhh.

13:30.376 --> 13:31.684
Clear.
Check the next room.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.051
I got eyes on two tangos, Finch.
I'm taking them out.

13:34.213 --> 13:35.658
Absolutely not!

13:35.815 --> 13:38.255
If anything happened to you,
Ms. Zhirova would be defenseless.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.918
Let Mr. Reese worry
about the kidnappers.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.226
<i>You just get the girl out of there.
Now.</i>

13:44.123 --> 13:45.123
Shhh.

13:50.897 --> 13:53.571
- We can handle it.
- All right.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.167
Come on.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.548
- There they are!
- Run.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.847
Let's move!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.661
This way.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.389
It's okay.
I'm in here all the time.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.440
My listening station.
We should be safe here.

14:36.943 --> 14:40.618
- You did all this?
- Told you I was a spy.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.022
But I didn't do this.

14:47.754 --> 14:51.361
Finch. I think I might know
what this is all about.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.902
Gen has this whole building wired

14:54.060 --> 14:56.220
and it looks like someone found out
what she was up to.

14:56.244 --> 14:57.063
Any idea who?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.750
Did any of the people
you ever recorded

14:58.765 --> 15:00.267
talk about committing any crimes?

15:00.433 --> 15:03.312
Lots of them. I bugged anyone
who looked suspicious.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.916
Did it ever occur to you that that
might have been a really bad idea?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.485
I was just trying to get the
drug dealers out of my building.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.488
- Did you give the tapes to anyone?
- Not yet.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.127
New York's just like Russia.
You can't trust the cops.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.243
I was waiting
until I had something on the dealers

15:19.318 --> 15:21.491
that was too big to ignore.

15:22.822 --> 15:26.326
- Yeah, they're not ignoring you, kid.
- Well, I know that now.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.140
- So where are the tapes?
Somewhere safe.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.144
Hey.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.914
I'm a spy too, remember?

15:42.175 --> 15:45.918
<i>Got a location on the tapes, Finch.
You're gonna wanna write this down.</i>

15:47.980 --> 15:49.186
Clear.

15:50.316 --> 15:51.316
Hey.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.218
We got rats in the walls
but I got a plan.

16:15.374 --> 16:17.547
Get the masks from the trunk.
Let's go!

16:23.883 --> 16:26.830
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.792
- I'm Shaw.
- Nice to meet you.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.369
Where'd you learn how to do that?

16:33.526 --> 16:36.905
My grandfather taught me.
He was in the KGB.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.335
Gave me this, too.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.012
Order of Lenin.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.508
I wear it everywhere I go.

16:46.572 --> 16:49.018
You should sell it.
Probably worth a lot of money.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.917
What's wrong with you?

16:52.078 --> 16:56.652
I mean, why are you like this?

17:01.554 --> 17:03.154
You know that thing
that made you flinch?

17:07.425 --> 17:08.564
I don't get that.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.208
- You don't get scared?
- Or sad.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.105
Or happy or lonely.

17:16.502 --> 17:21.076
I do angry, okay,
but that's about it.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.946
Did something happen?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.137
Been this way
as long as I can remember.

17:26.161 --> 17:27.265
I was, uh...

17:29.081 --> 17:31.459
...about your age

17:31.617 --> 17:34.063
when I figured out I was different.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.559
- What's that?
- R-22.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.433
They must have punctured the pipes
for the building's AC.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.269
We'll be dizzy in ten seconds,
unconscious in 40.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.309
What happens after that?

17:48.467 --> 17:50.572
You don't wanna know.
Come on.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.461
Stop! No!

18:22.001 --> 18:23.742
So talk to me, Sameen.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.281
You like TV?
What's your favorite show?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.783
I don't have one.
They're different everywhere you go.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.515
- You move around a lot?
- Yeah. Dad's in the military.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.354
He likes TV.
We watch football together.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.689
Well, you're being a trouper
just like him.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.691
We're gonna call your mom, okay?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.495
And she's gonna come
and take care of you.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.263
Ready to get out of here?

19:07.847 --> 19:10.191
<i>We got the kid.
Take out the trash.</i>

19:20.860 --> 19:23.898
Maybe clean out your trunk
next time, dumb-ass.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.183
- Do you have her?
- No, we were hoping that you had.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.329
But I'm glad to know
you're still alive.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.896
That makes one of us.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.661
- Any clue where they took her?
- We're working on it.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.704
- Bear could only track Ms. Zhirova...
- Gen. Her name is Gen.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.621
<i>He could only track Gen
as far as the street.</i>

19:57.663 --> 19:59.263
She could be anywhere
in the city by now.

19:59.398 --> 20:02.936
The guy who kidnapped me
isn't talking.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.944
But, uh... I got his cell.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.826
<i>It might lead us to the guy
with the tremor.</i>

20:08.941 --> 20:11.888
Give me his location.
I'll handle the rest.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.019
Bear found blood, Shaw.
A lot of it.

20:17.183 --> 20:21.427
- And he seems to think it's yours.
- I'm fine.

20:21.587 --> 20:24.761
I'm sending you the address
of a doctor who owes us a favor.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.699
<i>John can track the man
with the tremors.</i>

20:26.859 --> 20:31.365
And I think I finally have the means
to determine why she was abducted.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.042
I've recovered Gen's tapes
right where she said they were.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.618
A girl after my own heart.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.483
I know this went sideways, Finch.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.648
But you can't bench me
for every mistake.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.259
<i>I'm not punishing you for an error,</i>

20:50.416 --> 20:51.936
<i>I'm protecting you
because you're hurt.</i>

20:52.084 --> 20:54.792
You've done enough, Ms. Shaw.
We'll take it from here.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.823
What are we doing here?
This is way off our beat.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.192
Lunch.
You're welcome.

21:28.354 --> 21:30.834
Come on. Do you really wanna
wait in that line for a taco?

21:30.990 --> 21:35.700
No, I want you to wait for two tacos,
extra bulgogi and some kimchi slaw.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.431
Plus whatever you want.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.658
<i>Any problems, you call me.
We clear?</i>

22:11.497 --> 22:13.135
<i>Joint operation's on schedule.</i>

22:13.299 --> 22:14.573
Good.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.906
<i>The package has been delivered.
Pay the man.</i>

22:25.144 --> 22:26.817
<i>Hey.</i>

22:27.012 --> 22:28.821
<i>Look, something came up.</i>

22:28.981 --> 22:30.426
Take the car and cover for me.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.063
I'll make my way back
to the precinct.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.823
Lost my appetite.

22:38.424 --> 22:40.768
<i>No, man. It's your tum
to call for pizza, man.</i>

22:40.926 --> 22:42.269
<i>I don't wanna call for...</i>

22:57.443 --> 22:59.116
Read the labels, Harold.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.925
Ms. Shaw, everything all right?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.596
- Do you know who took Gen?
- Not yet.

23:08.754 --> 23:10.791
But I can't help noticing
that you are nowhere near

23:10.956 --> 23:13.027
the doctor that I recommended.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.263
<i>In fact, you seem to be...</i>

23:17.696 --> 23:19.656
You wanna tell me
why you're holding the same junk

23:19.680 --> 23:22.251
as the guys who took Gen?
Sit down, Vadim.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.041
Got a little something for you.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.310
Mm, good, huh?

23:31.477 --> 23:33.479
It'd be a shame to see it
all go to waste.

23:35.047 --> 23:39.154
Now I can either re-up your stash
or I can flush it all.

23:40.486 --> 23:44.730
Stupid kid.
Bugging people's rooms.

23:44.890 --> 23:48.303
They sweep for transmitters.
Who uses wires anymore?

23:48.460 --> 23:51.339
But they find the wire,
then they find recorders

23:51.497 --> 23:53.101
then they find me.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.973
- You told them about Gen?
- They knew already.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.173
They give me this.
They tell me to find the tapes

23:59.338 --> 24:01.909
and not to report it
if she went missing.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.350
Who?

24:09.949 --> 24:13.624
Bratva.
The Russians.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.020
<i>I don't know if you realize,
but you're asking a lot.</i>

24:37.176 --> 24:39.986
<i>I don't know if you realize,
but I'm not asking.</i>

24:44.049 --> 24:48.054
Finch, I'm closing in
on the kidnapper's cell.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.663
<i>I don't know if you realize,
but I'm not asking.</i>

24:56.829 --> 24:59.400
<i>Most accidents
don't require a shovel.</i>

24:59.565 --> 25:02.205
<i>Most accidents
don't require a shovel.</i>

25:06.372 --> 25:09.251
- That's my guy.
- Paying my guy.

25:21.220 --> 25:25.168
- Finch, I know who has the girl.
- So do I, Mr. Reese.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.612
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's not polite

25:35.768 --> 25:37.907
to spy on people, little girl?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.410
Hmm?

25:40.239 --> 25:43.686
Now, where are the tapes?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.028
So we called your mom,
Okay, Sameen?

25:59.191 --> 26:00.602
She's coming right now.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.535
Where's my dad?
Is he stuck in the car, too?

26:11.470 --> 26:13.973
Sweetheart,
it was a really bad accident.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.609
Your dad got hurt.

26:16.775 --> 26:19.756
Then why are you with me?
You should be taking care of him.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.823
Yeah, I wish I could, sweetie.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.154
But sometimes
people get hurt so bad

26:25.317 --> 26:29.322
that they fall asleep
and they don't wake up.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.495
You mean he's dead?

26:33.158 --> 26:34.728
Look, I'm so sorry, Sameen.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.533
If there was anything
I could have done...

26:43.168 --> 26:45.978
I'm hungry.
Can I have a sandwich?

27:03.489 --> 27:05.765
Ms. Shaw,
you're still not at the doctor.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.029
<i>I must insist that you...</i>

27:11.163 --> 27:14.042
Finch, Carter knows
how HR found Gen.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.769
They ran her fingerprints.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.607
Every legal immigrant
gets fingerprinted

27:17.769 --> 27:18.889
when they enter the country.

27:19.037 --> 27:23.110
That still doesn't explain exactly
what she has on HR.

27:23.275 --> 27:28.190
- How's our friend with the tremor?
- Awake, but not exactly a chatterbox.

27:28.347 --> 27:32.796
Perhaps we should let Mr. Yogorov
and Detective Simmons do the talking.

27:32.951 --> 27:36.330
<i>- What kind of joint operation?
- One in our mutual interest.</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:39.492
<i>My boss wants your people
to stop moving the old product</i>

27:39.658 --> 27:41.160
<i>and try something new.</i>

27:41.326 --> 27:43.033
They ever say what the product is?

27:43.195 --> 27:46.665
No, but one of your pictures may turn
out to be worth a thousand words.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.142
The tanker that you spotted

27:49.301 --> 27:52.874
bears a chemical formula KMnO4.

27:53.038 --> 27:57.043
Potassium permanganate.
Commonly used in water treatment,

27:57.209 --> 28:00.156
but also a key ingredient
in a dangerous new class of drugs.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.919
Synthetic cathinones.
Otherwise known as bath salts.

28:04.082 --> 28:09.088
- So basically, HR's dealing drugs.
- <i>Perhaps not simply dealing.</i>

28:09.254 --> 28:11.256
The drug may be intoxicating,

28:11.423 --> 28:15.371
but pure potassium permanganate
is just toxic.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.939
Exposure produces symptoms
similar to Parkinson's.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.940
Our new friend isn't sick.

28:21.099 --> 28:22.874
He's been cooking designer drugs
for HR.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.742
Thank you, Finch.

28:30.442 --> 28:34.913
Nitroglycerin.
It's highly unstable.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.755
The slightest shock could set it off.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.359
Drop it
and it'll blow your knees off.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.628
I'd hold steady if I were you.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.737
So you've been making drugs for HR.
Where do the Russians come in?

28:50.896 --> 28:53.035
HR makes the stuff,
the Russians move it.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.576
- They called in a big meeting.
- With the head of HR?

28:55.734 --> 28:57.270
The top dealers in town.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.076
HR wants the Russians
to lay down the law,

28:59.100 --> 29:02.113
force them to stop selling coke,
"H," whatever, start selling salts.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.617
You get all that, Finch?

29:03.775 --> 29:07.313
Yes, and I've found something in one
of Gen's recordings that confirms it.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.779
Screw the Colombians.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.980
<i>This stuff is made right here
in the US of A, all right?</i>

29:10.983 --> 29:13.896
<i>We've got a massive facility,
city gets hooked, we all get rich.</i>

29:15.387 --> 29:16.593
So where is the cook site?

29:16.755 --> 29:20.828
I only helped with the first batch,
but a pipe burst.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.593
I got hosed
with whatever did this to me.

29:22.617 --> 29:24.563
After that,
they moved someplace bigger.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.976
Please. That's all I know.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.577
Hmm.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.116
And I believe you.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.780
Hey. Hey!

29:36.942 --> 29:38.615
You can't just leave me here!

29:40.345 --> 29:43.758
So HR's tailoring crime
in the city to fit their needs.

29:43.915 --> 29:46.589
And we've got the tapes
to prove it to the DEA.

29:46.752 --> 29:50.097
Look, Carter,
I know you said no deals but...

29:50.255 --> 29:52.758
of course we trade the tapes
for the girl.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.484
Are we really gonna leave him
like that?

29:54.526 --> 29:57.200
Relax.
It's just corn syrup.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.222
We got a 911 call.
Someone's having a heart attack?

30:22.287 --> 30:24.733
<i>Sorry, we're required to check.
If you'd just let us in.</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:27.997
What was that ambulance
doing out front?

30:52.918 --> 30:56.229
- Where's the girl?
- That's HR's deal.

30:57.189 --> 31:02.036
The cops might kill a kid.
My people have standards.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.594
You know
where they make this stuff?

31:05.063 --> 31:06.940
I just handle distribution.

31:07.099 --> 31:11.411
- Ever try it?
- Hell, no. My body's a temple.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.093
Have you left the country
in the last six months?

31:17.117 --> 31:18.460
No.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.123
- Ever had unprotected sex?
- Why? You offering?

31:26.885 --> 31:27.955
No.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.096
Ever had hepatitis, malaria,
Chagas disease, or babesiosis?

31:32.257 --> 31:34.396
- No. What the hell is this about?
- I need blood.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.639
So I'm taking yours.

31:39.564 --> 31:40.975
You don't even know my blood type.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.444
I'm AB Positive.
Universal recipient.

31:56.381 --> 31:57.792
Get HR on the phone.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.438
<i>Someone wants to talk with you.</i>

32:08.593 --> 32:11.802
<i>Put the girl on the phone, or I
paint the walls with Yogorov's brains.</i>

32:18.603 --> 32:23.177
- Shaw, is that you?
- Hang on, kiddo. I'm coming for you.

32:26.511 --> 32:29.788
Okay. Let's talk terms.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.193
<i>I'm copying the HR tapes.</i>

32:33.351 --> 32:36.992
But I have hours of analog audio
and no way to speed up the process.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.355
Gen doesn't have hours, Finch.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.199
We need to tell HR we're willing
to trade the tapes for...

32:41.359 --> 32:42.360
Way ahead of you, John.

32:42.527 --> 32:45.167
You hired me to save Gen,
not bust dirty cops.

32:45.330 --> 32:47.332
So unless you got
a better idea, Harold...

32:48.800 --> 32:50.677
...I'm gonna need those tapes.

32:57.876 --> 33:01.221
We got a problem, Carter.
Shaw took the tapes.

33:01.379 --> 33:04.099
She's meeting Simmons on Randall's
Island to trade them for the girl.

33:04.115 --> 33:06.026
<i>But I'll be there to change the odds.</i>

33:06.184 --> 33:09.495
- Need help?
<i>- If I do, you'll be my first call.</i>

33:09.654 --> 33:12.134
I got eyes on her. Her pal
in the suit knows about the meet.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.530
<i>You're walking into an ambush.</i>

33:13.692 --> 33:15.399
No, he is.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.198
You guys are with me.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.080
Carter, there you are.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.241
Look. I need to talk to you
about something.

33:29.407 --> 33:30.807
Yeah, we can talk all day tomorrow.

33:30.831 --> 33:33.382
Come on, Carter.
I covered for you with the sarge.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.717
And I need your advice.

33:35.814 --> 33:39.057
I'm having a problem.
With somebody on the job.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.696
All right, what is it?

33:42.854 --> 33:45.994
Not here.
I know a bar nearby.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.575
All right, we're about to get
the tapes and the man in the suit.

33:58.603 --> 34:02.016
Showtime, people.
Prepare to fire on my order.

34:02.173 --> 34:05.950
Acknowledge.
Acknowledge, one.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.282
Acknowledge, two.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.754
- Where is everybody?
- Officer.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.797
I'd like to report a kidnapping.

34:21.458 --> 34:25.134
You win. Take her.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.299
Girl's not here.

34:33.538 --> 34:37.953
- Neither are the tapes.
- Looks like you got bad intel.

34:45.150 --> 34:47.322
Not a total loss.

34:48.719 --> 34:51.132
It's about time you and I
had a little talk.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.783
Gotta hand it to you, Finch.

35:13.144 --> 35:14.521
This was a better idea.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.250
Carter said Detective Terney
was involved in the joint operation,

35:17.415 --> 35:18.951
so it seemed reasonable to assume

35:19.117 --> 35:22.428
that his GPS signal
might lead us to the lab.

35:25.090 --> 35:26.865
Just tell me which way to go.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.803
Right. I hope.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.032
There are hundreds of us,
you know.

35:59.557 --> 36:00.797
You really think you can win?

36:00.959 --> 36:05.066
Armies fall,
one soldier at a time.

36:29.754 --> 36:31.734
You ready to get out of here?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.766
Hey, Finch, how much you know
about chemistry?

36:37.162 --> 36:38.903
Enough.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.247
Two beers, Jerry. On me.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.118
How you doing, Jer?

37:03.621 --> 37:05.066
You gonna join me?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.798
So, what's the problem, Laskey?

37:08.960 --> 37:12.430
Well, for starters, my own partner
won't even have a drink with me.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.778
So, you're having a problem
with someone at work?

37:23.942 --> 37:26.650
- Who?
- You.

37:26.811 --> 37:29.485
I mean, what's going on?

37:29.647 --> 37:30.887
I'm supposed to have your back,

37:30.949 --> 37:33.657
but how can I help you
if you don't even talk to me?

37:33.818 --> 37:36.162
- I'm fine.
- Like hell you are.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.834
With the secret phone calls
in the night,

37:39.991 --> 37:41.902
ducking out in the middle of a shift,

37:42.060 --> 37:44.939
hush-hush meetings
with some man in a suit.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.456
Who is he, anyway, 'cause
I don't think he's your boyfriend.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.137
Why are you so curious?

37:51.302 --> 37:54.306
Is it maybe because of this?

37:59.177 --> 38:00.485
I know, Laskey.

38:01.246 --> 38:05.023
I've known from the second
your ass landed in my car.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.358
Do you have any idea what it's like?

38:10.188 --> 38:13.192
- What what's like?
- Riding around all day

38:13.358 --> 38:16.532
with an arrogant bitch
who doesn't know her place.

38:16.694 --> 38:20.642
They spared your life,
but you keep pushing.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.839
And now your pal in the suit
is gonna pay the price.

38:22.863 --> 38:25.844
Trust me, he is not the one
you should be worried about.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.511
See, you just played Simmons for us.

38:28.673 --> 38:30.983
We fed you bad info,

38:31.142 --> 38:34.487
and you got Simmons
and his men away from the girl.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.286
You know,
when they assigned me to you,

38:37.448 --> 38:40.224
they told me to play the dumb rookie,

38:40.385 --> 38:41.989
see what I could find out.

38:43.288 --> 38:46.963
But Simmons gave me the authority
to pull your card anytime I want.

38:49.394 --> 38:53.137
What you think, Jerry?
Should I earn myself a new partner?

38:55.700 --> 38:58.909
You don't even know
who you are yet, son. Do you?

39:00.205 --> 39:03.084
But you wanna play Billy Badass?

39:03.241 --> 39:05.721
You go right ahead.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.915
But I spent enough time with you
to know you're afraid of me.

39:09.080 --> 39:13.358
That's why you have
your idiot friend here for backup.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.088
I know you, Laskey.

39:15.253 --> 39:18.598
Just like I know Jerry back there
is a lieutenant in Bronx Vice

39:18.756 --> 39:22.431
who paid for this bar with dirty cash
from shaking down hookers.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.904
And I have the proof
to put him away for it.

39:26.831 --> 39:30.244
Now I was gonna wait and arrest
you two with everyone else.

39:30.401 --> 39:33.041
But if this is how you wanna
play it, little man,

39:33.204 --> 39:35.411
guess I'll have
to take you down right now.

39:35.573 --> 39:38.110
You both can go easy
or it can be hard.

39:38.276 --> 39:39.836
They should've killed you,
you stupid...

39:42.847 --> 39:46.556
Put the gun down.
Put it down!

39:50.388 --> 39:51.924
Sit down!

39:59.030 --> 40:00.190
Now we gotta figure this out.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.107
Figure this out?
You just killed him.

40:02.267 --> 40:05.248
No. You did.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.317
Registered to you
in the state of New Jersey.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.783
All I gotta do
is submit it for ballistics.

40:10.942 --> 40:14.048
But I'm not gonna do that.
Not yet.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.591
You don't work for HR anymore, son.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.462
You work for me now.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.504
<i>Never seen anything like it.</i>

40:31.663 --> 40:34.667
I told her the news,
and she understood, but...

40:35.967 --> 40:39.574
I don't know. I think there's
something wrong with the kid.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.827
What if I don't like it?

40:53.985 --> 40:55.705
You lived with Vadim,
you can live anywhere.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.196
And it's supposed to be one
of the top schools in the world.

40:59.357 --> 41:04.534
Not every kid gets to become
the ward of a reclusive billionaire.

41:06.097 --> 41:09.635
Now if you're ever in trouble again,
call this number.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.042
Don't sell it, okay?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.049
I know it won't mean much to you,

41:19.210 --> 41:21.212
but it'll mean a lotto me
that you have it.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.400
I'm just not wired
for this kind of stuff, kid.

41:39.530 --> 41:42.909
I know.
I figured you out.

41:44.569 --> 41:47.049
It's not that you
don't have feelings.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.584
It's just like the volume
is turned way down.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.087
Like the sound on an old tape.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.720
The voices are there.
You just have to listen.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.592
Bye, Shaw.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.674
You're hurting me.

42:22.507 --> 42:25.511
So I, uh...
disobeyed some...

42:27.445 --> 42:31.086
Pretty much all... of your orders.

42:31.883 --> 42:32.953
Am I fired?

42:33.117 --> 42:36.428
On the contrary, Ms. Shaw.
I think you finally got the job.

42:36.587 --> 42:40.865
- Now about that bug in my library...
- Haven't found it yet, have you?

43:03.481 --> 43:05.483
Did you miss me?

43:06.984 --> 43:09.344
<i>We're gonna have
so much fun together.</i>
