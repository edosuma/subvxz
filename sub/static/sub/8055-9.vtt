WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.370
We're asking everyone
to do street parking.

00:04.404 --> 00:06.405
I'm not street parking
my Mercedes.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.240
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.376
'Cause nobody wants
to steal a Saturn.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.512
All right, uh,
moving on to recycling.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.316
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.518
I'm fine.
Continue.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.887
Okay, each department
will be getting blue bins...

00:23.423 --> 00:25.457
Do you need to go
to the dentist, Ron?

00:25.492 --> 00:27.159
I don't like dentists.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.228
Just a second.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.229
- Hey.
- No, no.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.296
No!

00:31.331 --> 00:32.430
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

00:35.335 --> 00:36.969
Aah!

00:37.003 --> 00:39.304
- Oh!
- What the?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.639
Oh, my God!

00:40.673 --> 00:42.941
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about...

00:42.976 --> 00:44.943
Recycling?

00:44.978 --> 00:47.212
Dentist pulled
the tooth out yesterday.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.615
But it's always a good idea
to demonstrate

00:49.649 --> 00:51.750
to your co-workers
that you are capable

00:51.785 --> 00:54.553
of withstanding
a tremendous amount of pain.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.890
Plus, it's always fun
to see Tom faint.

01:03.296 --> 01:13.896

01:20.346 --> 01:23.082
Attention, everybody!

01:23.116 --> 01:24.349
Everybody, listen up.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.120
You are all officially invited
to a dinner party,

01:28.154 --> 01:29.455
7:00 P.M. tonight
at our home,

01:29.489 --> 01:31.657
which is officially
my friend Burly's home,

01:31.691 --> 01:33.425
because I don't have a home.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.793
That's it.
There's no more left.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.095
Give it to him.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.463
We've been dating
for almost a month,

01:37.497 --> 01:39.164
so we just decided

01:39.199 --> 01:41.467
that we wanted to do
something special.

01:41.501 --> 01:45.104
And dinner parties do combine
two of our favorite things...

01:45.138 --> 01:46.772
dinner and parties.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.307
- Parties.
- Yeah.

01:48.341 --> 01:52.611
It's like if you could have
a Xbox pancake.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.313
Your invitations
include requests

01:54.347 --> 01:56.014
for each of you to bring stuff,

01:56.049 --> 01:57.516
'cause we don't have
a whole lot.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.185
- Don't be late.
- Watch out.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.621
"Dearest Tom,
please bring silverware."

02:02.655 --> 02:05.491
- "Please bring cooked steak."
- This is ridiculous.

02:05.525 --> 02:06.758
They're young.
They're in love.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.560
They're ready to show it
to the world.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.761
It's very sweet.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.630
- And we're all going.
- What?

02:11.664 --> 02:13.866
There's a boy's sale
at Dillard's today.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.400
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.702
You going tonight?

02:16.736 --> 02:19.538
Yeah. Apparently they want me
to bring <i>Avatar</i>

02:19.572 --> 02:24.143
and 50 pairs of 3-d glasses
and a 3-d-capable television.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.544
- Mm.
- Yeah.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.479
Well, I will see you there,
with all of those things.

02:27.514 --> 02:28.814
I was actually coming
to see you.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.115
I wanted your advice
on something.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.217
- Oh, yeah?
- My boss in Indianapolis...

02:32.252 --> 02:34.586
He wants me back on the road
in a week.

02:34.621 --> 02:38.056
But then this morning
Chris offered me a job

02:38.091 --> 02:41.527
to stay here in Pawnee
and work for him.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.929
- Do you want to do that?
- Well, I don't know.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.964
I've been moving around so much
the past few years,

02:45.999 --> 02:48.333
it might be nice to stay
in one place for a while.

02:48.368 --> 02:51.603
- What do you think?
- Well, this is a great city.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.405
You know, it's definitely
the best city in Indiana,

02:53.439 --> 02:55.507
probably America,
possibly the world.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.042
Sure.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.077
But on the other hand,
you've put in 12 years

02:59.112 --> 03:01.079
with the state government.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.548
So you think
I should say no to Chris

03:02.582 --> 03:06.552
and head back
to Indianapolis or...?

03:06.586 --> 03:09.087
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?

03:09.122 --> 03:11.023
You should make
a pros and cons list.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.258
- That always works for me.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.060
Okay, maybe I'll do that.

03:15.094 --> 03:17.029
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.630
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.232
Okay.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.370
So how does this work?

03:25.405 --> 03:26.972
All right, you just fill out
your name tag,

03:27.006 --> 03:29.041
- and you're all set.
- Okay.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.811
But I-I mean, do I just go up
and talk to anyone,

03:32.845 --> 03:35.714
or do I wait for them
to talk to me, or...?

03:35.748 --> 03:39.051
Are you asking me
how to flirt with men?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.386
Okay.
All right.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.788
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.457
I'm putting myself out there,
meeting some new people,

03:45.491 --> 03:47.826
having some casual fun,

03:47.860 --> 03:50.929
and it is...awkward.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.433
Gayle went out and got me
this new party shirt.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.802
So be honest...
What do you guys think?

03:56.836 --> 03:58.070
You know what, Jerry?

03:58.104 --> 04:01.673
I make fun of you a lot,
but credit where credit is due.

04:01.708 --> 04:05.410
You know, I like how the...

04:05.445 --> 04:09.848
Damn it. I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.417
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.

04:12.452 --> 04:15.087
April's friend Orin is here.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.322
He's very intense
and very weird.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.824
So if you end up
talking to him,

04:18.858 --> 04:20.325
just make sure you don't reveal

04:20.360 --> 04:22.094
anything personal
about yourself.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.829
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.632
- What'd you bring?
- I was in charge of the cake.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.368
To be fair, it's not a cake so
much as it is a vegetable loaf.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.136
You got your mushrooms,
your alfalfa sprouts,

04:31.170 --> 04:34.506
your spinach, and I had it
sweetened with fruit reduction.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.876
But did they ask you to bring
a vegetable loaf or a cake?

04:37.910 --> 04:40.178
No, a cake,
but this is so much healthier.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.514
So not only
does this thing exist,

04:42.548 --> 04:44.616
but now you have deprived
everyone of cake.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.152
- Take a walk, Ron.
- Yep.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.192
Donna.
Oh, my God.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.328
I am so excited to see you here.

04:56.362 --> 05:00.465
These things are horrible
when you're by yourself.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.667
What?

05:01.701 --> 05:03.869
Do you know
where you are right now?

05:03.903 --> 05:06.371
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.874
It's every woman for herself.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.643
- You're joking, right?
- Do I look like I'm joking?

05:11.678 --> 05:14.746
Dating is a zero-sum game.

05:14.781 --> 05:18.650
If you get a man,
I don't get that man.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.319
I'm here because of advice
that you gave me

05:20.353 --> 05:22.354
to be more adventurous
in my life.

05:22.388 --> 05:26.158
Here's some more advice...
Beat it.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.492
Hey.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.628
Ben, heard you
might be leaving Pawnee.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.931
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.232
Well, you are a huge nerd.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.034
But I'd be sorry
to see you go, man.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.302
Thanks, Tom.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.937
Okay, this party needs
a little help.

05:38.971 --> 05:40.272
I'll be right back.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.641
So are you going on, like,
a year-long walking tour

05:42.675 --> 05:44.476
of the set
of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>

05:44.510 --> 05:45.610
in New Zealand?

05:45.645 --> 05:47.612
To be honest with you,
I wasn't a fan

05:47.647 --> 05:49.448
of, uh, Peter Jackson's
interpretation.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.083
So you can put that one away.

05:51.117 --> 05:54.119
Andy, I think you maybe
should put some more food out.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.456
Totally agree. Just firing up
the bagel bites now.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.257
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.759
What do you think?

06:00.793 --> 06:02.260
April, you're not supposed
to let me see you.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.628
No, come on.
You have to look.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.964
This is important. You have
to tell me if I look good.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.466
Hey, guys, what's going on?

06:07.500 --> 06:10.035
Uh, it's supposed to be
a big surprise.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.436
But tonight

06:11.471 --> 06:15.173
me and April
are getting married...

06:15.208 --> 06:16.942
To each other.

06:19.579 --> 06:20.746
- Are you pregnant?
- Yes.

06:20.780 --> 06:21.913
- Yes?
- No.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.148
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?

06:23.182 --> 06:24.549
Is it like that movie
<i>A Walk to Remember?</i>

06:24.584 --> 06:25.550
- Yes.
- What?

06:25.585 --> 06:27.252
- No. God.
- Oh, God.

06:27.286 --> 06:28.920
Why are you doing this?

06:28.955 --> 06:31.223
Why is this great thing
happening?

06:31.257 --> 06:33.959
Well, I mean, it's actually
a really funny story.

06:33.993 --> 06:35.293
We were hanging out.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.963
And suddenly, I was like,

06:37.997 --> 06:39.664
"What if we got married
tomorrow?"

06:39.699 --> 06:42.768
And she was like...

06:42.802 --> 06:44.069
"Fine."

06:44.103 --> 06:46.505
- She's fine.
- That is a great story.

06:46.539 --> 06:48.440
But you guys haven't been
together very long,

06:48.474 --> 06:50.041
and you have no place to live.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.376
We've been together
long enough,

06:51.411 --> 06:52.644
and we'll find a place to live.

06:52.678 --> 06:53.845
Yeah.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.580
Like, a house
or, like, a condo or something.

06:55.615 --> 06:56.748
Probably a condo.

06:56.783 --> 06:59.050
It's... you can't just get
a condo.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.053
No, you're right...
house.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.256
I love Andy and April
as a couple.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.191
I want them
to stay together forever.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.727
But relationships
need planning.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.730
You just can't jump
into something without thinking.

07:11.764 --> 07:15.033
It took me four years
to find the right hairdresser,

07:15.067 --> 07:17.602
and we still fight
all the time!

07:17.637 --> 07:19.538
Andy and April
are gonna surprise people

07:19.572 --> 07:21.039
with a secret ceremony.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.442
Whoa.
Secret wedding.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.477
Julia Roberts
pulled the same move.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.013
Is that that toothy girl
from <i>Mystic Pizza?</i>

07:28.047 --> 07:30.248
Ron, please, I need you
to help me knock some sense

07:30.283 --> 07:31.416
into them.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.486
It's not really my place
or yours.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.189
- Hi. I'm Ann.
- Brian.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.857
What's your occupation?

07:38.891 --> 07:40.826
I'm a manager
at a sporting-goods store.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.128
- No way. Me too.
- Seriously? Which one?

07:43.162 --> 07:47.599
No, I'm not.
Um, I-I was just ribbing you.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.335
- What are you drinking?
- Yeah.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.838
- What?
- Oh, I don't know.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.673
I-I couldn't hear you.

07:54.707 --> 07:58.643
So you just laughed
and said, "Yeah"?

07:58.678 --> 08:01.613
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.482
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.016
Did you grow up in the woods?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.219
Are you Nell
from the movie <i>Nell?</i>

08:07.253 --> 08:09.821
I told you I'm rusty.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.456
All right, come with me.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.024
- Hey, Andy.
- Yeah.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.527
I know what's going down,
and I'm so happy for you guys.

08:15.561 --> 08:16.862
Thank you, Tom.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.330
Hey, something
just occurred to me.

08:18.364 --> 08:20.732
- Can I be your best man?
- Yeah, dude, totally.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.567
- Thank you.
- My best man.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.104
One of my life goals
is to be a best man.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.039
It's a baller position.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.574
You get drunk.
You make speeches.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.611
And you make love
to the prettiest bridesmaid,

08:32.645 --> 08:34.880
usually standing from behind.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.215
Look, I know that
I cannot tell you what to do.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.750
I know it doesn't work...

08:38.784 --> 08:41.219
From all the times I've tried
to tell you what to do before.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.554
But you know what would be fun?

08:42.587 --> 08:44.990
Maybe we should make
a pros and cons list.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.158
Let me take you home, and then
we'll go do that together.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.159
It'll be a blast.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.096
- Leslie, relax.
- You relax.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.532
You relax all the way home
and get into bed.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.067
- You need to go to bed.
- April.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.569
Girl talk.

08:57.603 --> 09:00.071
Hey, uh,
what's your middle name?

09:00.106 --> 09:02.040
The justice of the peace lady
needs to know.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.775
You don't know
each other's middle names?

09:03.809 --> 09:06.344
I don't want to say it
out loud.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.613
- Ew!
- Shut up.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.183
- Roberta!
- Such a loser.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.186
- Can't believe I'm marrying him.
- You don't have to.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.722
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.258
Then I'm gonna marry him again.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.929
One time, I fell madly in love
with a Civil War reenactor

09:23.963 --> 09:25.630
that I had only known
for six hours.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.732
And then I found out
he wore those clothes

09:27.767 --> 09:29.434
all the time.

09:29.468 --> 09:30.602
And he was married.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.305
But the clothes thing
really bothered me.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.441
You always want
to scribble the name.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.144
Make them read.
Draw them in.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.446
- Make them work for it.
- Right.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.948
Two shots of Jameson.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.717
Don't make
too much eye contact.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.720
You want to seem available,
but not too available.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.522
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.591
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.797
All right...
Let's do this.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.999
Ron, you are so amazing

10:01.033 --> 10:04.669
with me and April, stuff.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.504
I love you, man.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.573
Would you be one
of my best men?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.776
I'd be honored to, son.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.579
Chris, you helped me
get April back.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.414
Would you be my best man?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.918
Nothing else in my entire life

10:19.952 --> 10:22.320
would make me happier
as long as I live.

10:22.355 --> 10:26.024
Jerry. Ah, I'm so glad
you made it.

10:26.058 --> 10:27.192
This shirt is hilarious.

10:27.226 --> 10:30.629
Derek and Ben,
will you be my best men?

10:30.663 --> 10:33.298
Got a little competition
for the best man, huh?

10:33.332 --> 10:35.700
Well, you know what the best
best man does.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.936
Excuse me!

10:37.970 --> 10:40.305
Are there any strippers here?

10:40.339 --> 10:42.107
Former strippers?

10:42.141 --> 10:44.442
Non-dancers but you're feeling
a little bit drunk?

10:44.477 --> 10:45.844
What are you doing?

10:45.878 --> 10:47.912
I'm throwing Andy
an impromptu bachelor party.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.547
It's my duty as best man.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.116
The wedding's in four minutes.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.584
It's that kind
of negative thinking

10:52.618 --> 10:55.186
that makes you
a less good best man.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.721
Hello?

10:56.756 --> 10:57.822
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie...

10:57.857 --> 10:59.591
Leslie Knope
from the Parks Department.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.459
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.261
April and Andy
are getting married tonight.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.163
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

11:05.197 --> 11:06.598
I need you
to get down here, Ann.

11:06.632 --> 11:10.268
I need you to kiss him again
or kiss her or kiss somebody.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.071
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!

11:13.105 --> 11:15.140
Relationships
are like scuba diving.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.143
If you come up too fast,
you get the bends.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.477
And the reason why I know this

11:19.512 --> 11:20.879
is because I was dating
a guy once,

11:20.913 --> 11:22.047
and we were scuba diving,

11:22.081 --> 11:23.515
and I told him
that I loved him underwater,

11:23.549 --> 11:26.117
and he shot up really fast,
and he got the bends.

11:26.152 --> 11:30.121
No, Orin, I don't know
how I'm going to die.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.123
Wait. Are you asking me
or telling me?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.792
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

11:33.826 --> 11:34.893
Yes, please.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.961
April and Andy
are about to get married.

11:36.996 --> 11:41.132
Wow. My Brita filter is older
than their relationship.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.068
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?

11:43.102 --> 11:45.170
I don't know. It depends
on how frequently you use it.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.172
- It's true.
- Stay focused, okay? Please.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.741
The point is two boneheads
whom I love dearly

11:49.775 --> 11:51.309
are about
to sacrifice their future

11:51.343 --> 11:53.078
'cause they haven't thought
this thing through.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.546
And nobody seems concerned
about this.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.916
Attention, everybody.
Madames and...

11:57.950 --> 12:00.485
Mis...Wahs.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.655
If you would do me
the obligation

12:03.689 --> 12:08.993
of having your honor heretofore
in the room

12:09.028 --> 12:11.696
doth right over there,
uh, hence.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.831
What?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.833
Big event in that room,
15 minutes.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.735
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.

12:16.769 --> 12:20.605
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.808
And that is why I have to stop
their wedding.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.946
Remember how I told you
there was going to be

12:27.980 --> 12:29.447
a surprise later?

12:29.482 --> 12:32.317
Well, the surprise is you're not
actually at a dinner party.

12:32.351 --> 12:35.620
You're at our wedding.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.159
All right.
Uh, let's do this.

12:43.000 --> 12:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:04.450 --> 13:06.217
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:06.252 --> 13:07.786
we are gathered here today

13:07.820 --> 13:13.792
to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer
and April Roberta Ludgate.

13:13.826 --> 13:17.095
I guess I kind of hate
most things.

13:17.129 --> 13:21.099
But I never really seem
to hate you.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.668
So I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.770
- Is that cool?
- Yes.

13:27.573 --> 13:29.040
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

13:29.074 --> 13:32.343
"April, you're the most
awesome person I have ever known

13:32.378 --> 13:33.411
"in my entire life.

13:33.445 --> 13:37.949
"I vow to protect you
from danger.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.151
"And I don't care
if I have to fight

13:40.186 --> 13:42.654
"an ultimate fighter
or a bear or him,

13:42.688 --> 13:45.089
"your mom...
I would take them down."

13:45.124 --> 13:46.424
Andy.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.526
I'm getting mad right now
even thinking about it.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.861
- I'm telling you.
- It's okay.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.997
I want to spend the rest
of my life...

13:53.032 --> 13:54.232
every minute...
with you.

13:54.266 --> 13:58.970
And I'm the luckiest man
in the galaxy.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.106
And now the rings.

14:05.077 --> 14:08.446
By the power vested in me
by the state of Indiana,

14:08.480 --> 14:11.683
I now pronounce you husband
and wife.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.391
- Go fly away.
- Fly. Fly.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.227
- Wings of love.
- Oh.

14:22.261 --> 14:23.461
Okay. All right.

14:23.495 --> 14:24.963
So that one is dead.
We know that.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.711
You wouldn't have been able
to stop it, you know.

14:39.745 --> 14:43.114
I could've yelled something
or tackled someone.

14:43.148 --> 14:45.583
But you didn't,
because deep down,

14:45.618 --> 14:47.252
you knew
it wouldn't have mattered.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.153
Those kids are gonna do
what they want to do.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.855
They may have just ruined
their lives

14:50.890 --> 14:52.724
on an impulse decision.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.726
Leslie, I got married twice.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.228
Both times, I was a lot older
than those two.

14:57.263 --> 15:00.965
And both marriages ended
in divorce...

15:01.000 --> 15:02.667
And a burning effigy.

15:02.701 --> 15:05.203
Who's to say what works?

15:05.237 --> 15:08.539
You find somebody you like,
and you roll the dice.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.342
That's all anybody can do.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.611
Wait. Weren't you married
three times?

15:13.646 --> 15:16.614
Oh, my God, you're right.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.685
I get to burn another effigy.

15:20.719 --> 15:23.354
The key to burning
an ex-wife effigy

15:23.389 --> 15:25.523
is to dip it in paraffin wax

15:25.557 --> 15:29.360
and then toss the flaming bottle
of isopropyl alcohol...

15:29.395 --> 15:31.162
From a safe distance.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.031
Do not stand too close

15:33.065 --> 15:35.733
when you light
an ex-wife effigy.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.337
My sister is lame,
but Andy's sort of cool.

15:39.371 --> 15:42.073
I guess I kind of see
why he'd marry her.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.809
Also, if anyone finds
my gray hoodie, I lost it.

15:44.843 --> 15:46.277
Thanks.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.748
That was beautiful.

15:50.783 --> 15:55.653
You two remind me
of me and my husband, George.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.555
I got to nail the speech.

15:57.589 --> 16:00.091
So I brought in an expert...
Jean-Ralphio.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.926
Can I throw something on you,
see if it feels good?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.294
Sure.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.495
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.498
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote,
obviously.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.134
<i>Swingers Crashers?</i>
<i>Fred Claus.</i>

16:10.169 --> 16:11.936
Talk about
Andy's ex-girlfriends.

16:11.971 --> 16:16.607
Quote from <i>Love Actually.</i>
<i>Hold back your tears. Pause.</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:18.309
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.180
I wish you the best of luck,
to both of you.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.118
Aw, thank you, grandma.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.954
How can anyone
ever possibly top that?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.689
Am I right?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.624
So thank you all
for all the talking.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.426
Let's just get
back to dancing, huh?

16:37.763 --> 16:41.232
Cool.
See you around maybe.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.168
- That went better, right?
- Yes, it did.

16:44.203 --> 16:47.305
However, he proudly told me
that he "beat herpes."

16:47.339 --> 16:49.540
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.809
I just found out
Andy's getting married.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.146
- So?
- So that's my ex-boyfriend.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.748
We were together
for a really long time.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.283
- All right.
- What?

16:59.318 --> 17:02.987
What? Listen, you are a hot,
young doctor.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.056
- I'm a nurse, actually.
- Okay, I don't know you.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.358
But I do know
that you can fix your attitude.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.093
Do you want to go home
and feel sorry for yourself

17:09.127 --> 17:10.595
about a man you didn't want
to marry?

17:10.628 --> 17:12.195
Or do you want to go talk
to that cute boy

17:12.231 --> 17:14.699
who has been looking at you
and give him your number

17:14.733 --> 17:19.303
before I throw him in my Benz
for myself?

17:19.338 --> 17:22.106
All right.

17:22.141 --> 17:25.675
I just want to thank
my family, my friends,

17:25.711 --> 17:28.613
most importantly,
my <i>best</i> best man,

17:28.647 --> 17:30.114
Mr. Tom Haverford.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.683
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.619
And, ladies, he's single,
I think.

17:34.653 --> 17:35.887
You're not still married,
are you?

17:35.921 --> 17:39.190
- No.
- But you... you're straight?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.159
- Yes.
- Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?

17:41.193 --> 17:43.027
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

17:43.062 --> 17:46.931
Anyways, oh, my God,
I'm married!

17:46.965 --> 17:49.700
This is crazy.
What happened?

17:49.735 --> 17:53.671
But, seriously,
life is short, right?

17:53.705 --> 17:56.207
Uh, just... I really think
you should just do

17:56.241 --> 17:57.508
whatever makes you happy.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.144
That's what April and I did.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.746
We are in love.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.981
So we didn't overthink it.

18:04.016 --> 18:08.352
I mean, seriously,
I cannot emphasize

18:08.387 --> 18:10.321
how little we thought
about this.

18:10.355 --> 18:11.989
Am I right?

18:12.024 --> 18:15.660
All right, well, this is a song
I wrote for you,

18:15.694 --> 18:18.396
April Roberta Ludgate.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.099
I love you.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.055
Exactly. Mortality.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.790
See, I like to take each day
at a time.

18:45.824 --> 18:49.227
There's nothing in the world
we can't accomplish if we try.

18:49.261 --> 18:50.495
I have to go.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.631
It's been great talking to you.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.334
- Hey.
- Don't worry.

18:56.368 --> 18:57.902
I'm not gonna say another word.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.036
This is your day.

18:59.071 --> 19:02.974
I just wanted to say that...

19:03.008 --> 19:05.576
I'm really glad you're here.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.513
I think you're awesome,
and I love you.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.249
Oh.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.320
What's the deal
with that hot girl, April?

19:16.355 --> 19:18.256
- What's the deal with her?
- Yeah.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.758
Like, she good to go?
Like, she down to clown?

19:20.792 --> 19:24.095
She's married.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.630
She got married,
like, 20 minutes ago.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.566
Oh, my God. That's the same
girl from the thing.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.601
From the wedding ceremony,
yeah.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.104
All the good ones
are taken, huh, bro?

19:35.707 --> 19:37.842
Yeah.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.182
Hey.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.420
You should stay.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.623
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.793
- You think?
- Yeah. Yes.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.728
It's a great city here,
you know?

19:57.763 --> 19:59.030
And there are great people.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.531
And you've made a lot
of friends.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.899
And what are you gonna do...

20:01.934 --> 20:05.770
Go back to your old job
and hack up people's budgets?

20:05.804 --> 20:08.606
Stay here.
Help us build something.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.375
I already accepted the job.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.346
- I'm, uh... I'm staying here.
- That's good.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.715
Yeah, I think so.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.953
- Orin's behind me, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.020
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.288
- So just keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.656
Don't panic,
'cause he can smell fear.

20:25.691 --> 20:26.724
Just keep talking to me.

20:26.758 --> 20:28.059
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.727
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.196
- How was the wedding...
- Run.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.169
"Hope we can get
together soon."

20:38.203 --> 20:40.338
Okay, now you write,
"Who is this?"

20:40.372 --> 20:41.606
Ah.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.641
Hey, you guys, we got a video
from April and Andy.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.742
- Oh. Okay.
- Whoo!

20:44.776 --> 20:46.010
Yeah!
How you guys doing?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.912
- Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
- It is awesome.

20:47.946 --> 20:52.683
We're at Burly's family
vacation house on Lake Michigan.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.018
We're having so much fun,

20:54.052 --> 20:55.419
except for, uh, Roberta here

20:55.454 --> 20:57.922
turns out sucks
at water-skiing so bad.

20:57.956 --> 20:58.956
I'm gonna divorce you.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.391
Andy sucks at driving a boat.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.160
And I'm gonna divorce him,
probably right now.

21:03.195 --> 21:06.063
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.
