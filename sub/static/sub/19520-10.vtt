00:01.734 --> 00:04.002
It's like there's a
cord between our hearts.

00:05.165 --> 00:08.007
It's you and me. It's
always been you and me.

00:08.957 --> 00:10.841
We belong to each other,

00:11.226 --> 00:13.459
and I don't ever want to
live in a world without you.

00:16.387 --> 00:17.620
We pulled two bodies

00:17.645 --> 00:19.765
out of Falls Lake a couple days ago.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.556
We're charging you
additionally with the murders

00:21.593 --> 00:23.460
of Jim Blackwell and Audrey Ellis.

00:23.762 --> 00:24.938
Norman is nice...

00:24.963 --> 00:26.696
okay, he's kind, he's a good person...

00:27.098 --> 00:28.998
but he just... he has
another side to him.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.167
You know, I don't... I don't
know what you'd call it,

00:31.269 --> 00:32.969
maybe multiple
personalities or something,

00:33.071 --> 00:34.594
but he... he changes.

00:40.812 --> 00:43.379
I'm coming for you when
you least expect it.

00:48.053 --> 00:49.018
Hello, Norman.

00:49.772 --> 00:50.954
All right. Get him out.

00:51.056 --> 00:52.587
And get in the back.

00:52.958 --> 00:54.290
What do you want with us, Alex?

00:54.392 --> 00:55.916
You're gonna take me to her body.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.362 --> 01:15.685
How much further?

01:16.221 --> 01:17.324
There's a turn,

01:17.349 --> 01:18.715
then there's a little more of a drive,

01:18.817 --> 01:20.514
and then there's a little walk.

01:20.752 --> 01:22.986
But we are getting close, Alex.

01:23.088 --> 01:25.521
No.

01:25.623 --> 01:26.856
Alex.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.494
Please don't kill me. Please.

01:31.596 --> 01:32.762
See what you've done now

01:32.864 --> 01:34.497
on your little quest
for stupid vengeance?

01:34.599 --> 01:35.943
She's innocent.

01:38.269 --> 01:39.973
Stop it. Stop crying.

01:42.357 --> 01:43.506
Alex, what happened to you?

01:43.608 --> 01:45.008
I don't understand any of this.

01:45.110 --> 01:46.242
This isn't about you, Regina.

01:46.344 --> 01:47.910
But you've lost your mind.

01:48.013 --> 01:49.912
Jesus, I haven't lost my mind!

01:50.271 --> 01:51.732
That's debatable.

01:58.356 --> 01:59.522
Regina.

01:59.624 --> 02:00.857
Regina, dear, slow down.

02:00.959 --> 02:02.025
I think that the turn is coming up.

02:02.127 --> 02:04.460
Here?

02:04.562 --> 02:06.129
Yes. Yes, here. Here.

02:06.491 --> 02:08.074
Turn there please, Regina.

02:10.668 --> 02:12.368
All right, stop. Stop. Stop the car.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.488
- No.
- Stop the car.

02:18.665 --> 02:20.494
- All right, get out.
- No, please!

02:20.555 --> 02:21.821
- Get out.
- Please. Please.

02:21.954 --> 02:22.986
Get out of the car.

02:23.011 --> 02:24.277
Get out of the car!

02:31.189 --> 02:32.555
Please, don't.

02:32.657 --> 02:34.125
Go on. Go.

02:34.526 --> 02:36.239
Go. Just start walking.

02:37.149 --> 02:38.261
Follow the road.

02:38.363 --> 02:39.829
It... it's gonna take you
back to the main highway.

02:39.931 --> 02:41.330
Okay? I can't give you
your phone right now,

02:41.433 --> 02:42.899
but someone'll find you in a few hours.

02:43.001 --> 02:44.000
I might die of hypothermia.

02:44.102 --> 02:45.317
Walk fast.

02:46.504 --> 02:48.404
You got a good coat
on. You'll be fine. Go.

02:48.506 --> 02:49.839
This isn't who you are, Alex.

02:49.864 --> 02:51.063
Go before I change my mind!

02:55.947 --> 02:56.923
Get out. Get out.

02:56.948 --> 02:58.714
You're riding up front
from now on. Come on.

03:01.352 --> 03:02.618
Okay, how much farther up the road?

03:02.720 --> 03:03.619
Okay? Specifically.

03:03.721 --> 03:05.688
Uh... maybe 10 minutes?

03:05.757 --> 03:06.991
Maybe...

03:07.797 --> 03:09.193
I'm lying.

03:12.864 --> 03:14.604
You better pray you're not lying.

03:15.467 --> 03:16.853
I'm not lying.

03:49.156 --> 03:51.033
All right, get this out wide.

03:51.136 --> 03:54.670
30-mile radius, and call
in the U.S. Marshal Service.

03:54.772 --> 03:56.372
I want everyone on this.

03:57.013 --> 03:59.075
And get somebody to
check the residences.

03:59.177 --> 04:00.810
Bates and Romero.

04:00.841 --> 04:01.807
All right.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.179
Come on in.

04:18.129 --> 04:19.603
What's going on?

04:19.964 --> 04:21.930
Your brother Norman was kidnapped

04:22.033 --> 04:23.566
from the police station

04:23.668 --> 04:25.602
by Alex Romero.

04:26.271 --> 04:28.070
How the hell did you let that happen?

04:28.173 --> 04:31.261
He also took our office manager, Regina,

04:31.824 --> 04:33.482
took her hostage,

04:33.975 --> 04:36.212
so this isn't just about Norman.

04:37.282 --> 04:38.568
Sit down.

04:45.190 --> 04:49.358
Do you have any idea where
Romero could take Norman?

04:49.460 --> 04:51.318
You want my honest opinion?

04:51.629 --> 04:53.399
He took him somewhere to kill him.

04:54.499 --> 04:57.266
Okay, now, I-I don't know if
that's... if that's the woods

04:57.335 --> 04:59.217
or if that's Norma's grave, I...

04:59.920 --> 05:00.911
I don't know.

05:00.936 --> 05:02.513
This is in... this is insane.

05:04.976 --> 05:06.609
Norman is sick, okay?

05:06.711 --> 05:08.611
He needs psychiatric help.

05:09.055 --> 05:10.780
Did you forget your
brother has been charged

05:10.882 --> 05:12.782
with multiple murders?

05:13.184 --> 05:14.318
What, so... so that means, you know,

05:14.419 --> 05:15.952
you don't care if
something happens to him?

05:16.054 --> 05:17.720
The person I care about the most

05:17.822 --> 05:18.988
is Regina Worth,

05:19.013 --> 05:20.400
and I'm gonna do whatever it takes

05:20.425 --> 05:22.058
to get her back safe.

05:24.835 --> 05:27.255
You better not let
anything happen to him.

05:27.665 --> 05:30.700
He's a suspect. He hasn't
even been convicted.

05:47.842 --> 05:49.135
Right here.

05:49.687 --> 05:51.125
I think we should...

05:51.889 --> 05:53.085
Norman?

05:53.110 --> 05:54.857
It's not for you to be here.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.242
It's... let me deal
with this, okay, Norman?

05:57.762 --> 05:59.195
Look, I don't know what's going on,

05:59.297 --> 06:01.530
but you do not want to mess
with me right now, Norman.

06:03.443 --> 06:06.409
Would it shock you to
know that I'm not Norman?

06:07.752 --> 06:10.491
That he isn't here and
that you can't touch him?

06:11.276 --> 06:12.675
Spare me your bullshit.
Get out of the car.

06:12.777 --> 06:14.973
Oh, you're above it all, are you?

06:15.913 --> 06:17.446
And why should I tell you where she is

06:17.548 --> 06:19.515
if you're only gonna kill me anyway?

06:19.617 --> 06:22.151
Did you think about that,
Sheriff Lonely Heart?

06:25.657 --> 06:27.456
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

06:27.558 --> 06:29.959
I-I don't know what kind of sick fuck

06:30.061 --> 06:31.527
digs his mother's body out of a grave

06:31.552 --> 06:33.549
and moves it around, okay,
and I don't want to know

06:33.574 --> 06:35.498
about it or what you did to it.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.700
All I can tell you is, I can
shoot you once I find her,

06:37.802 --> 06:39.368
and I can make it quick and clean,

06:39.817 --> 06:41.738
or I can make you suffer for days,

06:41.806 --> 06:43.617
and believe me, I got ideas.

06:43.908 --> 06:45.708
Now you tell me how you want to do this.

06:45.810 --> 06:46.742
All right.

06:47.016 --> 06:48.274
Okay. All right.

06:50.011 --> 06:51.016
Get out.

07:15.605 --> 07:16.831
Get up.

07:29.445 --> 07:30.862
Why are you stopping?

07:31.955 --> 07:33.095
We're here.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.278
Show me.

08:14.399 --> 08:16.440
It will go faster if you help me.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.462
I'm so sorry.

09:15.927 --> 09:17.723
For everything that happened.

09:18.536 --> 09:20.659
I know how much you loved her.

09:48.493 --> 09:50.507
I'm gonna get you out of here.

09:52.630 --> 09:54.359
I'm gonna get you out of here.

10:01.005 --> 10:02.105
I'm sorry.

10:05.076 --> 10:09.581
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
I... I couldn't help you.

10:11.716 --> 10:13.154
I love you.

10:14.218 --> 10:15.584
I'll always love you.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.649
You... you killed her.

10:50.782 --> 10:52.574
You killed your own mother.

10:55.226 --> 10:57.150
You can't hide from it.

11:28.795 --> 11:30.035
Mother.

11:39.454 --> 11:42.506
Don't listen to him, Norman.
He's just trying to hurt you.

11:47.031 --> 11:48.648
I think I did kill her.

11:49.814 --> 11:52.003
I think I did. I didn't want to.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.416
She was everything I had.

11:57.687 --> 12:00.182
I mean, it was supposed
to be the both of us.

12:02.248 --> 12:03.613
I have to leave now.

12:06.397 --> 12:08.435
No. I'll have no one.

12:11.185 --> 12:12.636
You can't leave me now.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.471
You know everything now,

12:15.573 --> 12:17.947
and there's nothing for
me to protect you from.

12:24.181 --> 12:25.902
Good-bye, Norman.

12:47.091 --> 12:49.555
Good morning, honey.
It's a beautiful day out.

12:50.595 --> 12:51.828
How'd you sleep?

12:53.835 --> 12:55.721
Mother, you're here.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.313
Yeah, of course I'm
here. I live here, silly.

13:00.338 --> 13:03.339
I just had the most horrible dream.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.628
What happened in it?

13:07.216 --> 13:08.377
I don't...

13:08.416 --> 13:10.149
I don't even want to think about it,

13:10.189 --> 13:11.392
it's so horrible.

13:12.049 --> 13:14.031
Okay, then don't. Let it go.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.958
I dreamed you died.

13:23.105 --> 13:24.380
Well, I didn't.

13:25.363 --> 13:26.568
I'm right here.

13:29.837 --> 13:32.403
It's all good, honey.
It's just a silly dream.

13:33.304 --> 13:35.096
Life is in front of us.

13:40.578 --> 13:41.878
Where are you going?

13:45.037 --> 13:46.278
Mother?

13:53.724 --> 13:54.942
Mother!

14:03.501 --> 14:04.564
Mother.

14:13.334 --> 14:14.656
You're really here.

14:18.182 --> 14:19.670
Oh.

14:20.584 --> 14:23.018
You just had a bad dream, honey.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.652
You need to learn how
to wake up from 'em.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.713
You... you can if you
just try hard enough.

14:41.272 --> 14:42.329
Mother.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.691
It won't stop.

14:50.815 --> 14:51.814
Mm...

14:52.850 --> 14:54.597
Am I still dreaming?

15:00.891 --> 15:02.003
Mother?

15:08.065 --> 15:09.321
Mother.

15:15.272 --> 15:16.338
What?

15:16.440 --> 15:18.340
I have some exciting news.

15:18.442 --> 15:19.498
Tell me.

15:22.179 --> 15:24.847
We're moving to Oregon.

15:25.614 --> 15:27.483
What... what are you talking about?

15:27.585 --> 15:30.188
I bought a place with
the insurance money,

15:30.213 --> 15:32.421
and I bought a new car.

15:32.523 --> 15:35.225
Well, it's a new used
car, but it's a Mercedes,

15:35.593 --> 15:38.160
and we're gonna pack some shit;
we're gonna get in that car;

15:38.262 --> 15:40.396
we're gonna go to a new place;
and we're gonna start over,

15:40.498 --> 15:42.737
and we're gonna be really, really happy.

15:44.048 --> 15:45.321
What place?

15:47.205 --> 15:49.805
Mother, how could you
do this and not tell me?

15:49.830 --> 15:52.837
Because it's a surprise,
and I know you'll love it.

15:53.342 --> 15:54.908
Come on! Get up. Come on.

15:55.112 --> 15:56.412
We got packing to do.

15:58.215 --> 15:59.797
Okay, Mother.

16:00.341 --> 16:01.505
I'm coming.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.237
Okay, this is the part where you say,

16:16.262 --> 16:19.931
"Mother, this is so beautiful.

16:20.838 --> 16:23.179
"I'm so happy we're moving here.

16:23.744 --> 16:25.584
You are so smart to
have thought of this."

16:28.345 --> 16:30.652
Mother, this is so beautiful.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.674
I am so happy you're making me move here.

16:37.321 --> 16:41.496
You are so smart to force me
to do things I have no say in.

16:44.695 --> 16:46.207
You're an ass.

16:59.076 --> 17:00.075
Open your eyes.

17:02.580 --> 17:03.838
What do you think?

17:09.185 --> 17:11.105
This is crazy, Mom.

17:12.089 --> 17:13.568
It's not crazy.

17:13.924 --> 17:15.834
We're gonna run this place.

17:17.394 --> 17:20.329
We own a motel, Norman Bates.

17:21.799 --> 17:24.034
Come on. I want to show you the house.

17:33.777 --> 17:35.677
Bought the whole thing,
the house and the motel,

17:35.779 --> 17:38.570
had a foreclosure, and
everything came with it.

17:39.316 --> 17:41.079
The space is beautiful.

17:42.286 --> 17:43.886
It's all gonna be good.

17:43.988 --> 17:45.120
You'll see.

17:49.493 --> 17:51.046
Okay, Mother.

17:51.762 --> 17:53.403
I'll believe you.

18:05.409 --> 18:07.109
Hey, hey, hey!

18:08.245 --> 18:11.112
Well, look what the cat
dragged back into town.

18:11.151 --> 18:12.427
Hey, Remo.

18:12.753 --> 18:15.409
What's going on, man?
Thanks for coming over.

18:15.448 --> 18:16.987
Oh, my pleasure.

18:18.042 --> 18:20.309
Hey, I heard about what's
happening with your brother.

18:20.496 --> 18:22.171
I'm sorry about that, man.

18:23.942 --> 18:25.575
So is that a wedding ring?

18:25.677 --> 18:26.576
Yeah.

18:26.678 --> 18:27.977
Yeah, I got married.

18:28.079 --> 18:29.612
Yeah, I met a chick.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.482
She's a sister of one of our trimmers.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.807
Dude, everything's changed around here.

18:34.832 --> 18:36.098
You wouldn't believe it.

18:36.176 --> 18:37.875
I'm working for this licensed grower now.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.435
We grow 22 strains of artisanal cannabis.

18:41.552 --> 18:43.919
We deliver to 31 dispensaries
all over the place.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.122
It's unbelievable. It's like a real job.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.524
That's great, man.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.960
And your daughter and Emma.

18:51.062 --> 18:52.828
Yeah. Yeah.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.463
That's awesome.

18:54.565 --> 18:56.532
Thanks, man. Yeah, it's, uh...

18:56.634 --> 18:57.767
It's great.

19:01.706 --> 19:02.956
Well.

19:04.442 --> 19:05.818
Have a peek at that.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.169
Here.

19:08.613 --> 19:10.680
What do I, uh...

19:10.782 --> 19:12.214
No, no, no. You don't owe me anything.

19:12.239 --> 19:13.949
I got a ton of those
things laying around.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.435
No use for 'em anymore.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.953
All right, you... you sure?

19:18.056 --> 19:19.355
You're gonna offend me

19:19.457 --> 19:20.642
if you don't put that wallet away.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.160
Thanks.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.333
Just, uh, tell me that's for protecting

19:30.358 --> 19:31.634
your wife and your daughter.

19:31.659 --> 19:32.635
Yeah.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.633
And me.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.221
And you?

19:36.674 --> 19:37.707
You all right?

19:40.423 --> 19:41.789
Yeah, I'm okay.

19:41.946 --> 19:42.978
Yeah?

19:43.081 --> 19:44.135
Nah, I'm good.

19:44.782 --> 19:45.909
All right, cool.

19:46.317 --> 19:47.275
Well, I got to split,

19:47.318 --> 19:48.351
but, uh, next time,

19:48.377 --> 19:49.562
give me a little more notice.

19:49.587 --> 19:51.253
We can make a real plan.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.723
All right? Get together. Have some beers.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.725
Reminisce about our outlaw days.

19:55.827 --> 19:56.985
All right.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.738
Sheriff Greene!

20:24.055 --> 20:25.506
You get some rest.

20:26.057 --> 20:28.796
I'm gonna go down and
check out the office.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.027
We can get it all set up tomorrow.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.570
I want this place to
be a success for us.

22:08.659 --> 22:09.892
Okay. Let's go.

22:09.994 --> 22:11.274
Close the door.

22:11.275 --> 22:12.541
Someone close the door.

22:14.448 --> 22:15.781
Hey, can I help you?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.275
We need a room for the night.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.413
They've had it with the car for today.

22:19.679 --> 22:21.404
Wow, what happened to you?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.107
Oh, I, uh,

22:24.414 --> 22:26.633
I just... I fell down the steps.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.253
Yes. Getting used to this place.

22:29.355 --> 22:31.255
There... there are a lot of steps.

22:34.556 --> 22:36.627
But w-why don't you...
Hey, come on inside.

22:36.652 --> 22:38.048
- Great.
- We're not actually

22:38.074 --> 22:39.440
officially open yet, but I reckon

22:39.465 --> 22:41.465
we can accommodate you.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.901
I'll just need your name and address

22:44.003 --> 22:45.803
- and a credit card number.
- Okay.

22:45.905 --> 22:48.105
Our system just isn't up yet.

22:48.207 --> 22:50.572
Harry, Dylan, stop touching everything.

22:52.389 --> 22:53.555
Sorry.

22:55.815 --> 22:57.047
His name's Dylan?

22:57.150 --> 22:58.098
Hmm.

22:58.684 --> 23:00.104
I have a brother named Dylan.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.152
Yeah?

23:01.254 --> 23:03.320
We named him after Dylan Thomas.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.555
The poet.

23:06.225 --> 23:07.558
- Right.
- My husband's working

23:07.660 --> 23:09.427
at the University of
Washington for a semester,

23:09.529 --> 23:11.982
and so we're on our way to visit him.

23:12.765 --> 23:14.598
Uh, that's... that's nice.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.358
Here, uh... here you go.

23:17.937 --> 23:20.070
No other guests, so
Harry and Dylan can make

23:20.173 --> 23:21.972
as much noise as they like.

23:22.074 --> 23:25.176
Ugh, thanks, but is it okay
if they play outside for a bit?

23:25.278 --> 23:27.122
I mean, it's safe here, right?

23:27.613 --> 23:29.564
It's nothing if not safe.

23:29.916 --> 23:31.110
Thank you.

23:32.852 --> 23:33.851
Okay. Honey, just leave it.

23:33.953 --> 23:34.985
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

23:43.863 --> 23:45.095
Got it?

23:45.198 --> 23:46.779
Okay. Watch out.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.666
Okay.

23:51.938 --> 23:54.205
You guys need to get some energy out.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.933
Get out of the way. Get
out of the way. It's cold.

23:58.955 --> 23:59.910
Okay.

24:00.502 --> 24:02.969
Hey, everybody's getting in.

24:14.715 --> 24:16.283
Can I get a shot of Jack?

24:26.110 --> 24:27.141
Thanks.

24:39.108 --> 24:40.907
You look all alone.

24:42.704 --> 24:43.763
Can I get a double?

24:43.982 --> 24:45.038
Mm.

24:48.584 --> 24:50.763
Look, I'm... I'm just here to drink.

24:51.899 --> 24:53.854
And try to figure something out

24:53.879 --> 24:56.221
that is completely beyond my control.

25:02.364 --> 25:03.530
I'm so sorry.

25:03.632 --> 25:04.698
I don't mean to be a dick.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.600
I've just had a really bad day.

25:06.899 --> 25:07.934
Okay.

25:10.914 --> 25:12.110
Hello?

25:13.358 --> 25:15.010
Dylan, it's me.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.039
It's Norman.

25:19.540 --> 25:21.173
You okay? W-where are you?

25:21.275 --> 25:22.641
Of course I'm okay, Dylan.

25:22.743 --> 25:26.545
I, uh... I just... I
just wanted you to know

25:26.647 --> 25:28.513
that we're at the new
house with the motel,

25:28.615 --> 25:31.780
and I miss you.

25:33.712 --> 25:35.509
And I know Mother does too.

25:38.752 --> 25:40.029
Wait... "Mother"?

25:40.954 --> 25:44.229
Norma, as... As you like to call her.

25:44.809 --> 25:45.865
Look, I know. I know.

25:45.966 --> 25:49.568
I know that she can be
so stubborn sometimes.

25:49.670 --> 25:52.137
I... it's just because
she gets hurt so easily,

25:52.239 --> 25:54.372
and I-I know that the two of you

25:54.474 --> 25:58.376
had that terrible fight before
we moved from Scottsdale,

25:58.478 --> 25:59.744
but I just...

26:00.343 --> 26:02.293
I think this could be a new beginning,

26:03.266 --> 26:04.716
Dylan, for all of us.

26:08.425 --> 26:11.034
And we're not a family
without you, Dylan, and...

26:12.128 --> 26:15.727
so I just really think we
should start over and, uh,

26:17.244 --> 26:18.864
and be together and... and that I guess

26:18.966 --> 26:20.398
the real reason that I'm calling is,

26:20.500 --> 26:24.569
I would love it if you
could come over for dinner.

26:28.174 --> 26:29.573
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

26:29.598 --> 26:31.776
I'll be... I'll be right over, okay?

26:32.570 --> 26:33.868
You will?

26:34.004 --> 26:36.271
Oh.

26:36.850 --> 26:38.617
Uh, Norman?

26:39.309 --> 26:40.285
Yeah?

26:43.346 --> 26:44.956
Are you with Romero?

26:45.477 --> 26:46.791
Romero?

26:49.781 --> 26:51.463
No, I-I don't know a Romero.

26:56.113 --> 26:57.466
Okay.

26:58.278 --> 27:00.482
All right, well, um, you
just... just hang tight, okay?

27:00.507 --> 27:02.278
I'll... I'll... I'll be over soon.

27:02.814 --> 27:04.793
All right. Tha... thanks, Dylan.

27:04.825 --> 27:07.325
I'll see you, uh, see you soon.

28:52.879 --> 28:54.574
Hey, Dylan. What... what's happening?

28:54.636 --> 28:56.946
Norman's been missing
from jail for a day.

28:57.716 --> 28:59.119
Romero kidnapped him.

28:59.585 --> 29:01.039
Emma, he...

29:01.687 --> 29:03.187
Norman called me.

29:03.849 --> 29:06.091
He's at the house. He
wants me to come over.

29:09.075 --> 29:10.435
Does the sheriff know?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.131
No.

29:12.739 --> 29:14.392
Dylan, you have to tell her.

29:15.768 --> 29:17.988
She doesn't give a shit about Norman.

29:18.771 --> 29:20.171
If I tell her, then
they're gonna rush in there,

29:20.273 --> 29:22.039
and he's gonna end up dead.

29:22.141 --> 29:23.174
Well, I don't care.

29:23.276 --> 29:24.442
I don't care about Norman.

29:24.544 --> 29:26.010
I care about you.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.787
Dylan, you have a child.

29:30.112 --> 29:31.540
I know I have a child.

29:35.555 --> 29:37.087
Do I have a wife?

29:42.962 --> 29:44.562
Please don't do this.

29:44.664 --> 29:46.564
Just... just call...
Just call the sheriff.

29:46.666 --> 29:48.420
Norman's dangerous.

29:49.235 --> 29:51.244
He's not dangerous to me.

29:52.071 --> 29:53.648
You sound like Norma.

30:04.317 --> 30:06.130
Tell me you love me, Emma.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.489
No, I won't. I'm not gonna arm you up

30:09.522 --> 30:11.889
so you can go and do something stupid.

30:14.961 --> 30:17.417
I'll never love anyone else but you.

30:19.332 --> 30:21.708
You screwed me there, Emma Decody.

31:14.153 --> 31:15.192
Yes?

31:21.492 --> 31:24.093
Uh, did my brother
Norman check you in here?

31:24.430 --> 31:27.464
He's, uh, in his early 20s, dark
brown hair, and really polite.

31:27.567 --> 31:28.845
Yeah, why?

31:29.936 --> 31:31.068
You, um...

31:32.271 --> 31:33.571
You need to leave.

31:33.673 --> 31:35.639
What are you talking about?

31:37.343 --> 31:38.943
My br... my brother
has some mental issues,

31:39.045 --> 31:41.312
and he shouldn't be
checking people in the motel.

31:41.414 --> 31:43.083
- Mental issues?
- Yes.

31:43.516 --> 31:44.515
He... Look, it...

31:44.617 --> 31:46.317
He made a mistake checking you in.

31:46.772 --> 31:47.680
Oh.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.120
Just... just take your kids, and leave.

31:52.391 --> 31:54.458
Okay. Um, kids.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.627
Kids! I need you to put your
stuff in your roller bags.

31:56.729 --> 31:58.635
- But Mom!
- Do it now!

31:59.265 --> 32:00.798
Here's some... here's some money.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.499
There's a... there's a
motel, the Kings Motel.

32:02.602 --> 32:04.335
It's just... just up the
road. You can stay there.

32:04.437 --> 32:05.758
Hey, thank you.

32:06.506 --> 32:08.519
Just, uh, just leave
your keys in the room.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.295
Dylan.

32:53.595 --> 32:54.729
Hey.

32:56.001 --> 32:58.001
Thank you so much for coming.

32:58.398 --> 33:01.372
Mother is gonna be
so excited to see you.

33:01.904 --> 33:03.031
Come on in.

33:08.052 --> 33:09.755
Dinner's almost ready.

33:39.891 --> 33:41.395
Norman, we have to talk.

33:42.070 --> 33:44.258
Let me just put dinner
out on the table, okay?

33:44.344 --> 33:45.682
We can talk over dinner.

33:46.086 --> 33:47.183
Norman.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.058
Mother is gonna be so
excited you're here, Dylan.

33:56.324 --> 33:58.437
She's not here, Norman.

34:35.784 --> 34:37.034
Dylan?

34:37.136 --> 34:38.668
You two okay in there?

34:45.177 --> 34:46.777
You must be sick.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.445
Poor thing. Here, let me help you.

34:50.944 --> 34:52.616
Oh, poor Dylan.

34:53.039 --> 34:54.663
This has all been too much for you.

34:54.748 --> 34:57.312
Okay? I'm sorry that we
moved without telling you.

34:57.337 --> 34:58.788
You don't worry about this, all right?

34:58.813 --> 35:00.246
I'll... I'll clean it up.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.095
Norman.

35:04.196 --> 35:06.363
It's all fine, Dylan.

35:06.754 --> 35:08.765
You just got a little bit overexcited.

35:09.290 --> 35:10.868
Okay? Here. Sit down.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.391
Sit down with Mother.

35:12.493 --> 35:13.593
- Norman.
- Dylan.

35:13.695 --> 35:14.827
- Norman, stop.
- Just sit down.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.295
Stop what you're doing.

35:17.765 --> 35:19.899
- What am I doing, Dylan?
- Norman.

35:20.001 --> 35:21.467
Dylan, please don't ruin it!

35:21.569 --> 35:22.902
I have to, Norman!

35:22.927 --> 35:24.727
You're not living in the real world!

35:24.906 --> 35:25.905
You need to live in the real world!

35:26.007 --> 35:28.045
You... you have to stop this!

35:29.777 --> 35:31.285
Stop what, Dylan?

35:31.913 --> 35:34.313
Norma is... is dead, okay?

35:34.338 --> 35:36.105
She... Th-th-this is her body.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.263
- You brought her body here.
- Well, I disagree.

35:38.288 --> 35:39.621
This isn't something that you can...

35:39.649 --> 35:41.049
That you can agree or disagree with!

35:41.456 --> 35:42.855
She's dead, Norman.

35:42.957 --> 35:44.757
No, stop it. Stop it, Dylan.

35:44.859 --> 35:46.158
Stop saying that.

35:46.183 --> 35:47.810
You have to deal with it.

35:48.529 --> 35:49.662
You... you need to come,

35:49.764 --> 35:51.097
and you need to turn yourself in,

35:51.122 --> 35:53.869
and we need to get you help.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.595
That's what you want for me?

35:58.139 --> 36:00.640
To be shut up in some prison
for the criminally insane

36:00.665 --> 36:02.298
and drugged out of my mind?

36:02.323 --> 36:04.254
I don't know what I want for you!

36:05.555 --> 36:08.842
What I really want is something
that can never happen, okay?

36:09.927 --> 36:11.694
I want you to be happy, I wan...

36:11.719 --> 36:13.531
And I want you to be well.

36:15.399 --> 36:17.473
I want Mom to be alive again.

36:19.103 --> 36:21.804
I got... I wan... I
want both of you to...

36:21.906 --> 36:23.339
I want you guys to meet my daughter.

36:23.364 --> 36:24.450
I want to have... I want to have

36:24.475 --> 36:26.772
Christmases together, okay?

36:27.943 --> 36:30.610
I want all of these things
to have never happened.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.250
Well, if you believe hard enough,

36:35.353 --> 36:36.819
then you can make it that way.

36:36.921 --> 36:39.021
No, you... no, you can't!

36:47.123 --> 36:48.252
You can't.

37:28.406 --> 37:29.872
What are you doing?

37:31.886 --> 37:33.953
I can't let you take me away from her.

37:42.991 --> 37:44.649
Put down the knife.

37:45.637 --> 37:47.210
Norman, put down the knife.

37:51.564 --> 37:54.128
This is how it ends, isn't it?

37:54.231 --> 37:56.505
Doesn't have to end this
way. Put the knife down.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.119
I just want to be with her, Dylan.

38:05.910 --> 38:08.637
Norman, no. Don't ask me to do this.

38:27.128 --> 38:28.440
I'm sorry.

38:29.378 --> 38:31.193
I'm so sorry, Norman.

38:37.394 --> 38:38.440
Norman.

39:32.231 --> 39:33.619
Thank you.
