04:54.761 --> 05:00.829
<b>SWEET HOME</b>

05:02.125 --> 05:05.125
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

06:39.576 --> 06:43.144
Hey, babe.

06:43.177 --> 06:48.811
Tonight... well, yeah,
I don't know, I'm exhausted.

06:48.843 --> 06:53.144
Could we make it some
other night?

06:53.178 --> 06:55.677
I'm just messing with you.

06:55.709 --> 06:57.376
Happy birthday!

06:57.409 --> 07:01.743
I called you like 27 times
and you never picked up.

07:01.777 --> 07:08.145
No... we're not going to your
place, got a surprise.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.277
Simon!

07:10.310 --> 07:14.378
Simon, it's your birthday.

07:14.410 --> 07:16.811
Okay, okay, fine...

07:16.844 --> 07:19.411
I'll cancel the reservation.

07:19.444 --> 07:21.145
Okay?

07:21.178 --> 07:23.511
Do I get to buy some paninis
and some cheap ham...

07:23.543 --> 07:26.644
or does that make you feel
uncomfortable, too?

07:31.077 --> 07:35.611
Sorry. Yes, of course,
I understand.

07:35.644 --> 07:39.211
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

07:39.243 --> 07:42.310
Okay, at least trick your
housemates into going...

07:42.343 --> 07:44.044
to the movies or something.

07:46.811 --> 07:50.445
So... sorry, my battery
is about to die.

07:50.477 --> 07:53.477
I'll swing by for you later,
okay?

07:53.510 --> 07:55.311
I love you.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.511
Hey.

08:08.343 --> 08:15.344
People think that rent control's
a privilege, I call it justice.

08:15.644 --> 08:18.657
The price of rent
these days is crazy.

08:18.658 --> 08:20.611
Tell me about it!

08:20.644 --> 08:24.245
I've asked them time
and again to fix that.

08:24.278 --> 08:26.584
They just ignore me.

08:26.585 --> 08:28.972
It's really dangerous,
it could fall on you.

08:35.778 --> 08:37.811
And there's no one else left
in the building?

08:37.844 --> 08:40.544
No. No one.

08:40.577 --> 08:43.989
A while back a couple tried
to do up the ground floor,

08:43.990 --> 08:48.812
but the realtors
put a stop to it.

08:48.813 --> 08:52.444
Said they were building an
illegal duplex.

08:52.477 --> 08:56.444
And why was the renovation work
on the building stopped?

08:56.478 --> 09:01.545
They thought that way I'd leave,
but they're sorely mistaken.

09:01.578 --> 09:05.937
They even sent some squatters
in to make my life hell.

09:05.938 --> 09:07.040
Who did?

09:07.041 --> 09:09.822
Who do you think?
The realtors.

09:09.823 --> 09:13.212
Haven't you been listening?
They want me out.

09:13.245 --> 09:15.812
They want to tear
the building down.

09:15.844 --> 09:19.513
They buy up old buildings and kick
out the old people living there.

09:19.545 --> 09:22.985
They turn each apartment
into four or five,

09:22.986 --> 09:25.279
then rent them for
a small fortune.

09:25.311 --> 09:27.812
A great business!

09:27.845 --> 09:29.446
But not me.

09:29.479 --> 09:30.412
You're not going anywhere.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.279
No.

09:32.312 --> 09:34.146
Look...

09:34.178 --> 09:35.278
Ramon.

09:35.311 --> 09:37.812
Ramon. The law's on your side.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.679
And I'm giving the building
a favorable report.

09:40.712 --> 09:42.312
The structure's not damaged.

09:42.345 --> 09:44.346
But to be honest, I think you
should give in.

09:44.378 --> 09:48.479
Well, well! And I thought you
were working for them, too.

09:48.512 --> 09:51.813
Since there are no honest people
left in this country.

09:51.845 --> 09:54.512
Yeah... look I know you don't
want to hear this...

09:54.546 --> 09:57.312
but the situation's not likely
to improve.

09:57.345 --> 10:00.612
This isn't much of a home anymore,
especially not out there.

10:00.646 --> 10:02.178
I'm not leaving!

10:02.211 --> 10:04.179
I see.

10:06.345 --> 10:07.780
Wait...

10:07.812 --> 10:11.545
Could I have your card?

10:11.578 --> 10:14.079
In case I think of anything else
to tell you.

10:14.112 --> 10:16.745
Or, if something happens.

10:16.779 --> 10:20.380
If anything happens, Ramon, you
should call the police.

10:32.778 --> 10:35.179
I appreciate it.

10:35.212 --> 10:39.645
Be sure to close the front door
properly. Please.

10:39.679 --> 10:43.279
It's broken and anyone could
walk in.

10:43.311 --> 10:45.312
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.447
You are scared of your own
shadow.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.613
Silly, you.

11:55.647 --> 11:58.679
Stop, stop, stop! Look
at the mess you're making.

11:58.712 --> 12:01.146
I tried to get them to go
to the cinema...

12:01.180 --> 12:03.580
but they said with this weather, I
better just download something.

12:03.612 --> 12:06.046
It's okay. We'll go
someplace else.

12:06.079 --> 12:08.813
And don't say anything!
It hasn't cost me a cent.

12:08.846 --> 12:10.579
Okay, all right.

12:10.613 --> 12:13.279
Happy birthday.

12:13.312 --> 12:14.413
You have to put this on.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.179
Heh, you're joking.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.413
No. It's my birthday surprise
and I'm totally serious.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.180
Okay, all right.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.714
So what, are we going?

12:28.747 --> 12:30.247
Yeah, okay.

13:20.313 --> 13:22.480
Ali, what are you doing?

13:22.513 --> 13:24.547
Come on.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.580
I'm really wet, you know?

13:27.614 --> 13:29.647
Come on, okay, we're going.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.514
-So, start walking.
-Okay.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.714
Okay, good, stay here.
Give me a sec.

13:43.247 --> 13:47.580
Now, go farther, yeah...
it's okay, it's okay.

13:47.613 --> 13:49.615
Okay, I don't trust you!

13:49.648 --> 13:51.515
Okay, I'm with you.

13:52.714 --> 13:55.047
Now... one step.

13:55.081 --> 13:56.281
-Okay.
-One more.

13:56.314 --> 13:58.448
Yes.

13:58.481 --> 14:00.281
And...

14:02.680 --> 14:07.515
Surprise.

14:07.548 --> 14:09.214
Ali, what's this?

14:09.246 --> 14:13.148
Fit a bro and zero cost.
You like it?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.547
Of course, yeah!

14:15.580 --> 14:17.781
But where are we?

14:17.814 --> 14:22.114
Yeah, I borrowed some keys.

14:22.147 --> 14:24.447
Who's place is this?

14:24.480 --> 14:28.049
Don't ask. Tonight it's ours,
okay? No more questions.

14:28.082 --> 14:29.648
Okay.

14:29.681 --> 14:31.747
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

14:31.781 --> 14:33.681
Yeah?

14:33.713 --> 14:36.814
I swapped out the paninis
for my kid Ross.

14:36.848 --> 14:39.383
Veg one, no cost.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.580
And you know the best part
of Japanese food?

14:43.614 --> 14:44.815
What?

14:44.848 --> 14:47.316
It doesn't get cold.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.716
Tell me what
you're thinking about.

15:23.181 --> 15:24.516
Nothing.

15:28.215 --> 15:31.616
You've been in the dumps
for days now, something's wrong.

15:31.649 --> 15:35.149
Nothing's wrong... really.

15:42.648 --> 15:45.015
I don't like seeing you
like this.

15:51.115 --> 15:54.248
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm sorry.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.516
It's just that...

15:59.549 --> 16:03.083
Sometimes I think it'd be nice to
go back and do things differently.

16:03.115 --> 16:04.648
You know?

16:08.215 --> 16:10.415
You can't keep going
on like this.

16:10.448 --> 16:14.381
Well, I'm trying to stay
positive, I'm telling you.

16:14.414 --> 16:18.215
I've got too much time to think.
I need a job. I need money.

16:18.248 --> 16:21.548
It's not too late, Simon.

16:21.581 --> 16:25.149
I told you a thousand times, you
should try going back into medicine.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.750
It's not all that easy.

16:29.348 --> 16:31.249
I think you'd be happier.

16:31.283 --> 16:35.417
Yeah, well, I've got
to face the facts, okay?

16:35.450 --> 16:38.749
I am a nurse. It's not
that bad, is it?

16:38.781 --> 16:41.316
No, that's not what you want.

16:59.416 --> 17:03.316
Well, today is not the day
to talk about this.

17:03.348 --> 17:07.182
I don't want to think about it
now. It's your birthday.

17:07.215 --> 17:09.684
And...

17:17.248 --> 17:19.416
Tah-dah! Happy birthday.

17:19.449 --> 17:21.617
Fuck, honey, I told you,
no gifts.

17:21.648 --> 17:22.999
Yeah, but...

17:23.000 --> 17:24.348
I thought we had a deal.

17:24.383 --> 17:26.382
You know how this makes me feel.

17:26.415 --> 17:30.050
You already put the whole party
together, now you...

17:32.750 --> 17:36.115
Shit... I am such a dick.

17:36.149 --> 17:37.382
I'm sorry.

17:41.817 --> 17:43.482
-Your mother.
-Not now.

17:43.516 --> 17:46.250
She won't let up
until you answer.

17:46.283 --> 17:49.282
Seriously, I'm sorry.

17:50.550 --> 17:52.151
Hey, come here.

17:57.248 --> 17:59.750
I'll go, take this
to light the way.

18:01.184 --> 18:04.283
Ali! I'm sorry!

18:06.749 --> 18:08.549
Imbecile.

18:39.715 --> 18:43.316
Well, hey!
What are you doing out here?

18:43.350 --> 18:45.484
Hello! Come here.

18:45.516 --> 18:50.317
You're shaking, poor thing!

18:50.349 --> 18:52.683
You want to go upstairs?

18:52.716 --> 18:54.484
Okay, I'll take you.

18:54.516 --> 18:57.251
But you go in by yourself, okay?

20:21.717 --> 20:24.185
Nice fucking job.

20:24.217 --> 20:26.217
I'll go see if I can
find a dust pan.

20:26.251 --> 20:28.419
Where did you find this genius,

20:28.452 --> 20:31.518
I don't know, he looked smarter
to me the first time I saw him.

20:31.552 --> 20:36.285
Hey, screw the dust pan, let's
go.

21:12.452 --> 21:14.184
RamÃ³n?

21:37.285 --> 21:41.319
Shit! It's in the car.
Fuck!

23:27.152 --> 23:29.652
Please, Simon, don't come out!

23:34.152 --> 23:35.487
Ali?

23:48.320 --> 23:51.519
Ali?

23:51.553 --> 23:53.553
Ali?

23:56.718 --> 23:58.253
There's no one in there.

23:58.286 --> 24:00.053
Ali?

24:00.087 --> 24:02.620
Hey, hey, you stay here.
Be alert.

24:04.585 --> 24:06.020
Ali?

24:13.286 --> 24:15.420
Get him!

25:38.653 --> 25:41.520
What the hell's going on?

26:24.620 --> 26:26.722
Shut up! Calm down!

26:26.754 --> 26:29.187
You! Why the fuck are you
here? Who are you with?

26:29.220 --> 26:31.621
I don't speak Spanish very well.
I don't understand.

26:31.655 --> 26:34.088
Don't fuck with me.
Who else is here?

26:34.120 --> 26:35.387
I'm by myself.

26:35.421 --> 26:37.155
Bullshit. Who is Ali?

26:37.188 --> 26:40.422
Ali, my cat. I was looking
for her.

26:40.455 --> 26:44.255
Your cat, right? Cats don't
throw phones down stairs.

26:44.288 --> 26:48.321
In beast, you be true... and where
is Ali? We don't have all night.

27:03.687 --> 27:06.554
Where is it?

27:25.387 --> 27:28.688
Help me! Please!

27:30.788 --> 27:34.156
Is anyone there?

27:34.189 --> 27:36.323
Somebody help!

27:39.089 --> 27:41.789
Help! We're trapped!

28:08.854 --> 28:11.756
He's not getting any better.

28:13.489 --> 28:15.390
Your cat, right?

28:18.155 --> 28:20.156
Don't lie to me again.

28:20.188 --> 28:22.589
We've got to do something.
He's out cold!

28:33.388 --> 28:37.355
He's a doctor.
This fuck is a doctor.

28:37.389 --> 28:40.423
Shit. Do something,
come on!

28:40.455 --> 28:43.623
Get up, you have an emergency,
doctor.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.189
Get up.

28:45.221 --> 28:47.056
Get the fuck up!

30:27.823 --> 30:30.790
I think he might have some kind
of spinal cord injury.

30:30.824 --> 30:32.590
Moving him would be very
dangerous.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.823
What the fuck are you saying?

30:33.857 --> 30:35.591
Wait.

30:37.389 --> 30:38.424
Look.

30:39.390 --> 30:41.190
I need this, okay?

30:48.390 --> 30:51.257
See? He's got no feeling.

30:51.289 --> 30:53.524
He needs to be mobilized and
taken to a hospital.

30:53.556 --> 30:54.590
-What?
-The hospital.

30:54.622 --> 30:56.489
No hospitals.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.289
You fucking heard him! Just call
them and tell them what happened!

30:58.323 --> 30:59.724
We're not calling anybody, okay?

30:59.757 --> 31:02.091
They said it was only
going to be the old guy!

31:02.123 --> 31:03.556
This shit is not
our problem now!

31:05.823 --> 31:09.090
Could you use your goddamn head
for once, you fucking idiot?

31:09.124 --> 31:11.390
Of course, it's our problem.

31:11.422 --> 31:13.657
If they send someone, man,
we're fucked.

31:13.689 --> 31:16.556
Why would they need us if we
didn't know how to do our job?

31:16.589 --> 31:19.223
If we don't clean this up,
we are not getting paid.

31:19.257 --> 31:21.490
Do the job and you get paid.

31:21.523 --> 31:23.124
That was the deal.

31:23.157 --> 31:24.258
Okay.

31:25.723 --> 31:27.392
Okay, I get it.

31:59.490 --> 32:01.091
I'm gonna go see.

32:01.123 --> 32:02.524
Keep an eye on him.

32:30.724 --> 32:31.792
Something wrong?

32:31.824 --> 32:33.524
No.

32:33.558 --> 32:35.458
Don't do anything stupid.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.558
Emergency Services,
how can I help?

33:08.591 --> 33:10.691
I... there are...

33:10.724 --> 33:12.524
Me and my girlfriend, we're
locked inside a buil...

33:12.525 --> 33:13.425
there are three men here.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.725
They're trying to kill us.
You've gotta send someone.

33:15.758 --> 33:18.292
<i>Calm down, sir. I can't
understand you.</i>

33:18.324 --> 33:20.525
<i>Tell me, what is your location?</i>

33:20.558 --> 33:23.092
What?

33:23.125 --> 33:26.459
<i>I need you to tell me exactly
where you are. Sir?</i>

33:26.491 --> 33:28.792
I don't know.

33:28.824 --> 33:31.591
<i>I can't help you if I don't
know exactly where you are.</i>

33:31.625 --> 33:33.492
<i>Sir?</i>

33:49.492 --> 33:50.825
Fuck!

34:18.091 --> 34:20.492
Thanks for taking care
of my brother.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.692
Fuck! No!

34:35.491 --> 34:37.725
No! No!

35:09.624 --> 35:11.292
Are you okay?

35:11.326 --> 35:12.626
Yeah, are you?

35:12.659 --> 35:16.393
No, I'm not, I...
Who the fuck are these guys?

35:16.426 --> 35:21.292
I think... I think they are
from the real estate agency.

35:21.325 --> 35:22.460
They killed the old man.

35:22.492 --> 35:24.492
The real estate agency,
what the fuck?

35:24.526 --> 35:25.660
We need to get out of here!

35:25.691 --> 35:27.526
No, wait!

35:27.560 --> 35:30.225
The front door is stuck and all
the windows are bricked up.

35:30.258 --> 35:31.393
We can't get out of here.

35:31.425 --> 35:32.493
Shit.

35:36.326 --> 35:37.727
-Fuck! He's coming!
-What?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.326
Come on! Come on!

35:39.359 --> 35:41.160
What about the other guy?

35:41.192 --> 35:42.492
He's dead!

35:42.525 --> 35:43.626
Come on.

35:49.092 --> 35:50.727
-What are you doing?
-We got the keys.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.126
Hurry up!

35:54.659 --> 35:56.627
Go, go, go, go! Come on!

35:59.725 --> 36:02.427
Shit! Come on! He's coming!

36:02.459 --> 36:05.793
Close the door! Close the door!
Close the door!

36:05.826 --> 36:08.092
Open the fucking door!

36:08.125 --> 36:10.127
What are you doing?

36:13.293 --> 36:14.761
Agh! Agh!

36:25.525 --> 36:26.793
Somebody!

36:33.593 --> 36:37.094
Fuck! Holy fucking shit!

36:37.126 --> 36:40.194
I'm going to fucking kill her!

36:40.227 --> 36:42.294
Alicia, you bitch!

37:14.759 --> 37:16.760
Calm down.

37:19.561 --> 37:23.428
Hello? I know, I know.
I'm sorry for calling.

37:23.461 --> 37:27.227
We've got a problem.

37:27.259 --> 37:30.461
There were other people
in the building.

37:30.494 --> 37:32.660
I don't know.

37:32.693 --> 37:35.627
As well as the old man,
there was a couple.

37:35.661 --> 37:39.260
No idea!
They must have snuck in.

37:39.293 --> 37:42.326
Yeah, if you could send someone
I'd really appreciate it.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.461
Of course, I'll wait here.

37:44.494 --> 37:48.127
Got it. Thanks so much
and I'm really sorry.

37:48.159 --> 37:49.694
Okay. Bye.

37:57.527 --> 37:59.760
Let me take a look, okay?

37:59.793 --> 38:01.126
Fuck!

38:01.160 --> 38:02.661
Thanks for not pretending.

38:02.694 --> 38:04.594
Yeah, you're losing
a lot of blood.

38:04.626 --> 38:07.128
We need a 24-hour pharmacy.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.393
Don't piss a little, okay.

38:09.426 --> 38:11.627
Shit.

38:11.661 --> 38:13.261
I'm sorry about before.

38:13.293 --> 38:15.293
How about you two come out
and we finish this?

38:15.327 --> 38:17.528
What are you doing?

38:17.561 --> 38:21.828
Leave us alone! Fuck!

38:21.861 --> 38:24.561
What about the old man's flat? His
windows wouldn't be boarded, right?

38:24.594 --> 38:26.162
Yeah, and how would we
get there?

38:26.194 --> 38:27.428
What's going on in there?

38:27.460 --> 38:30.029
Cut us some slack, okay?

38:34.593 --> 38:37.028
Hey! What the fuck
is going on in there?

38:44.693 --> 38:47.461
Simon... the duplex.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.760
What?

38:48.794 --> 38:51.396
We're in the upper part.

39:06.361 --> 39:08.228
What are you gonna do?

39:08.261 --> 39:10.727
For now, get the blueprints out
of my purse, I'll be right back.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.761
There's gotta be a way.

39:24.794 --> 39:26.177
What about the basement?

39:26.178 --> 39:27.561
Yeah, I thought about it.

39:27.595 --> 39:29.495
We could get out to the
street through there,

39:29.496 --> 39:30.762
but I don't have the
keys to that door.

39:30.795 --> 39:34.128
Shit, this is a fucking
mousetrap.

39:34.161 --> 39:35.428
What... what about the roof?

39:35.462 --> 39:38.262
I checked it out and it's
bricked off.

39:38.294 --> 39:39.638
We could get out downstairs,

39:39.639 --> 39:42.327
and try reaching the old man's
apartment and call for help.

39:42.361 --> 39:45.329
And how do we get up to the third
floor without this guy seeing us?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.144
By climbing the freight lift.

39:50.145 --> 39:51.729
I don't know I'll be fit
for a hike.

39:51.761 --> 39:54.062
Yeah, I know. You stay here.
I'll go faster alone, okay?

39:54.096 --> 39:55.429
You can distract him.

39:55.462 --> 39:56.695
I... I don't think this
is a good idea.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.662
Yeah, me, neither.

39:58.695 --> 40:01.561
Just make all the noise you can and
keep his mind off the lift, okay?

40:01.594 --> 40:03.694
I don't know.

40:03.728 --> 40:05.561
Trust me.

40:08.694 --> 40:10.062
Be careful.

40:55.795 --> 40:57.762
Let us out!

40:57.795 --> 41:01.296
I already told you to come out.
I'm waiting here.

41:01.328 --> 41:02.695
Motherfucker!

41:49.161 --> 41:50.829
Stop with the fucking banging!

41:50.863 --> 41:52.730
-Hold on!
-Fucking idiot, man.

41:52.763 --> 41:55.063
Do you know how to say
that in Spanish?

41:55.096 --> 41:57.296
Screw you!
Go fuck yourself!

42:28.396 --> 42:32.130
Hey! Hey!

45:51.865 --> 45:54.698
Hey! Fucking look up here!

45:57.531 --> 46:02.066
Hey! Hey!

46:02.099 --> 46:08.066
Up here! Fuck! Up here!
For fuck's sake!

46:08.099 --> 46:11.631
Here! Fucking look up here!

46:15.532 --> 46:17.399
Fuck!

46:36.765 --> 46:39.466
Come on, Simon. Give me that!
Come on?

46:39.499 --> 46:42.032
You're a tough guy?

46:44.264 --> 46:46.298
You look like me, Simon?

46:56.532 --> 46:58.466
Come on!

47:07.398 --> 47:09.033
What the fuck?

47:12.565 --> 47:14.565
Where do you think
you're going?

47:14.598 --> 47:16.465
Hey! You're trapped!

47:16.498 --> 47:20.833
Agh! You're trapped! Where do
you think you're going?

47:20.865 --> 47:24.233
Fucking bitch! Agh!

48:05.365 --> 48:06.433
How'd it go?

48:06.467 --> 48:07.534
Badly.

48:07.566 --> 48:08.665
What happened?

48:08.698 --> 48:10.765
Shut up, he'll hear us.

48:10.799 --> 48:12.500
Who can hear us?

48:12.532 --> 48:14.133
The back-up.

48:33.232 --> 48:34.266
Who's that?

48:34.300 --> 48:36.332
The old man from upstairs.

48:36.366 --> 48:38.667
How did he get down here?

48:38.700 --> 48:40.600
Don't ask.

48:59.166 --> 49:01.801
Hey! I'm up here!

49:01.834 --> 49:05.467
Someone come and help me!
I'm trapped!

49:15.699 --> 49:17.666
Who the fuck is this guy?

49:17.700 --> 49:22.434
I don't know.
Let's go upstairs.

49:22.467 --> 49:25.467
It's about time! I've been stuck
here for half an hour!

49:26.599 --> 49:28.167
One of them's inside.

49:28.201 --> 49:30.101
I don't know where
the girl went.

49:38.766 --> 49:40.567
Will you get a move on?

49:40.599 --> 49:42.634
Unbelievable.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.101
What are you doing, man?

49:52.134 --> 49:53.234
Hey! No!

50:14.866 --> 50:16.735
What's he doing?

50:18.568 --> 50:20.635
Run! Down the stairs! Run!

50:53.334 --> 50:55.201
How are we gonna get out
of here?

51:41.134 --> 51:42.634
Shit!

51:42.667 --> 51:44.068
What's going on?

51:44.101 --> 51:46.734
He found the keys
to the basement.

52:23.534 --> 52:25.301
The lift, it's got electricity.

52:25.335 --> 52:27.502
What?

52:27.534 --> 52:29.802
If there's electricity, maybe the
emergency intercom's working.

52:29.835 --> 52:32.401
We could use it to call
for help.

52:32.435 --> 52:34.436
We'll be in the middle
of the building.

52:34.469 --> 52:36.603
He'll hear us, he'll see us.

52:38.701 --> 52:41.368
What about trying to steal the
guys to the basement off him?

52:41.402 --> 52:43.702
Yeah, he won't see us that way.

52:43.734 --> 52:45.568
I can't climb up there.

52:45.601 --> 52:47.335
Yes, you can.

52:47.367 --> 52:48.736
No, I can't.

52:48.769 --> 52:51.535
Simon, doing nothing
is not an option.

52:51.568 --> 52:53.101
Just sitting here,
I'm telling you,

52:53.102 --> 52:55.401
it's only a matter of
time before he finds us.

52:55.434 --> 52:57.756
We'll climb up the
shaft, call for help,

52:57.757 --> 53:00.135
and lock ourselves
in on the third floor.

53:00.169 --> 53:02.602
That why we'll buy some time
before they come help us.

53:06.569 --> 53:08.469
What if the intercom
isn't working?

53:31.136 --> 53:33.136
Hey.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.369
How about this?

53:43.802 --> 53:45.537
Let me help you.

53:49.469 --> 53:50.803
Was there no other color?

54:30.102 --> 54:31.324
If I don't get to
a hospital soon,

54:31.325 --> 54:33.770
I don't think there are
gonna be many more birthdays.

54:35.635 --> 54:38.502
We're getting out of here...
I promise you.

55:13.735 --> 55:17.138
When he starts to knock
the door down, we go, okay?

55:27.870 --> 55:30.771
Hey... sorry.

55:31.869 --> 55:33.136
For what?

55:33.169 --> 55:35.037
For this crappy birthday.

55:37.103 --> 55:40.171
I'm sorry I was such a dick.

55:40.204 --> 55:41.538
Thank you for my present.

55:41.570 --> 55:44.638
Yeah, it's pretty useful, right?

55:46.370 --> 55:49.104
I love you.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.771
Me, too.

56:03.237 --> 56:04.404
Let's go.

57:29.338 --> 57:30.405
Shit!

57:30.437 --> 57:31.371
What?

57:31.405 --> 57:33.171
It's not working.

57:33.204 --> 57:34.771
Let's go, Ali.

57:34.803 --> 57:36.205
No, wait.

57:40.304 --> 57:42.505
He's gonna find the hatch.

57:42.537 --> 57:44.238
Let's get inside.
We've still got time.

57:44.271 --> 57:46.171
It's gotta be a loose wire
or something.

57:46.204 --> 57:47.371
It's not gonna work, Ali,
come on!

57:47.404 --> 57:49.371
-Wait!
-Quit shouting.

57:49.405 --> 57:52.239
I'm not shouting. If this
doesn't work, we'll go, okay?

58:02.572 --> 58:04.439
Okay.

58:23.705 --> 58:25.138
Run!

58:44.272 --> 58:46.172
Run, Simon! Hurry up!

58:53.339 --> 58:55.373
Come on, Simon, come on.
Come on.

58:55.406 --> 58:58.073
Simon, come on! Simon!

58:58.105 --> 58:59.471
Simon, what are you doing?
Come on!

58:59.504 --> 59:01.338
I can't move.
I'm not gonna make it.

59:01.372 --> 59:02.638
-Leave! Go!
-No!

59:02.671 --> 59:04.239
I won't leave without you!

59:06.139 --> 59:07.539
Come on!

59:09.506 --> 59:13.105
I'm sorry, honey. I can't.
You have to go.

59:22.205 --> 59:23.639
I love you.

59:23.673 --> 59:24.806
Please go.

59:24.839 --> 59:26.507
I love you.

59:50.238 --> 59:52.272
No!

01:00:53.639 --> 01:00:56.474
Please don't hurt her.

01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:58.374
Please...

01:01:49.673 --> 01:01:51.407
I need help!

01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:36.474
Simon!

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.441
My god.

01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:29.675
We're leaving, Simon.
We're leaving.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.775
Look.

01:04:30.776 --> 01:04:31.841
What happened?

01:06:58.776 --> 01:07:00.709
Shit!

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:06.044
This is disgusting!

01:15:27.248 --> 01:15:28.382
Fuck!

01:15:55.148 --> 01:15:56.583
Go to hell!

01:15:56.616 --> 01:15:58.685
Son of a bitch! Mother fucker!
