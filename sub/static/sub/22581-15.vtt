WEBVTT

00:08.280 --> 00:11.119
The loss to the Vulcan people
is incalculable.

00:11.359 --> 00:14.717
P'Jem was one of our
most revered sanctuaries.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.876
Ambassador,

00:17.556 --> 00:21.754
we are very sorry for your loss.
But with all due respect,

00:21.954 --> 00:23.913
the High Command
has to take some responsibility.

00:24.153 --> 00:26.872
You were using the monastery
as a surveillance station.

00:27.112 --> 00:31.150
We were observing a dangerous
and aggressive neighbour.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.629
The Andorians wouldn't
have found the station

00:33.869 --> 00:36.188
if your people hadn't interfered.

00:36.747 --> 00:38.547
They've been in space
for six months,

00:38.787 --> 00:41.745
and they've already
destabilized an entire sector.

00:41.985 --> 00:43.904
I'm afraid I can't agree
with that, ambassador.

00:44.104 --> 00:48.262
This was a volatile situation
long before Starfleet got involved.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.861
Perhaps, if you'd been
a little more open with us,

00:52.061 --> 00:53.660
this tragedy might've been avoided.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.779
We warned you something
like this would happen.

00:56.979 --> 00:58.858
He's too impulsive.

00:59.058 --> 01:02.856
Captain Gardner would've made a far
more suitable commanding officer.

01:03.056 --> 01:06.414
The Vulcan consulate doesn't make
command assignments here.

01:13.651 --> 01:18.529
There was a time when your people
sought our guidance.

01:18.929 --> 01:21.528
I regret that time has passed.

01:22.207 --> 01:25.006
I've been recalled to Vulcan
for consultation.

01:25.206 --> 01:30.044
In the meantime, our joint fleet
operations have been suspended.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:39.600 --> 01:41.479
- Yes, admiral?
- Get me Captain Archer.

01:41.679 --> 01:43.238
Aye, sir.

01:46.557 --> 01:51.874
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:54.353 --> 01:57.752
"It's been a long time"

01:57.992 --> 02:01.790
"But my time is finally near"

02:02.030 --> 02:06.268
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:06.468 --> 02:09.387
"I will touch the sky"

02:09.586 --> 02:13.385
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:13.585 --> 02:16.624
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:16.823 --> 02:21.541
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:21.741 --> 02:24.660
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:24.860 --> 02:29.458
"I've got faith to believe"

02:29.658 --> 02:32.217
"I can do anything"

02:32.457 --> 02:36.935
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:37.175 --> 02:40.013
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:40.253 --> 02:45.571
"I can reach any star"

02:45.971 --> 02:49.689
"I've got faith"

02:49.929 --> 02:53.607
"I've got faith"

02:53.847 --> 02:58.605
"Faith of the heart"

03:14.223 --> 03:16.062
I noticed we changed
course overnight.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.662
I found a new system
in the Vulcan database: Coridan.

03:19.902 --> 03:23.180
They're only a few light years away,
so I thought we'd take a look.

03:23.380 --> 03:24.819
Inhabited?

03:25.460 --> 03:27.579
Just over three billion humanoids.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.898
Apparently, the Vulcans have
a mining agreement with them.

03:31.138 --> 03:33.857
I had Hoshi send a message
to their chancellor,

03:34.057 --> 03:36.376
and she invited us to visit
their capital city.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.535
Then I'll start shining my boots.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.014
I think I'll just take Hoshi.

03:43.654 --> 03:45.054
This time.

03:45.533 --> 03:48.933
The chancellor asked me to limit
the number of people I bring down,

03:49.133 --> 03:50.812
until they get to know us better.

03:53.612 --> 03:55.571
It's really too bad.

03:55.771 --> 03:57.530
According to the database,

03:57.730 --> 04:01.729
they've got the largest starship
construction yards in the sector.

04:01.929 --> 04:04.768
They're supposed to have ships that
can run circles around the Vulcans.

04:05.048 --> 04:06.367
Better than six-five?

04:06.607 --> 04:11.646
They say some Coridan ships
have reached warp 7.

04:11.886 --> 04:14.485
But that's just a rumour.

04:14.724 --> 04:16.404
Warp 7?

04:18.844 --> 04:20.483
You should lend Hoshi your camera.

04:21.363 --> 04:24.082
I'll be sure she takes lots of pictures.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.319
You had me going there
for a minute.

04:35.718 --> 04:38.798
- You're just too easy a target.
- So you're taking me, right?

04:39.038 --> 04:41.077
Bridge to Captain Archer.

04:43.437 --> 04:45.916
- Go ahead.
- I'm receiving a transmission

04:46.156 --> 04:48.435
from Starfleet Command.
It's Admiral Forrest, sir.

04:52.114 --> 04:53.633
Was anyone killed?

04:53.833 --> 04:55.872
The Andorians gave
the monks three hours

04:56.072 --> 04:57.592
before they started
their bombardment.

04:57.872 --> 04:59.992
Fortunately, they all got out in time.

05:00.191 --> 05:01.631
How are the Vulcans taking this?

05:02.790 --> 05:04.030
Not well.

05:06.550 --> 05:09.228
I can't really blame the Andorians
for reacting this way...

05:09.428 --> 05:10.428
Jon.

05:10.668 --> 05:11.948
If the roles were reversed,

05:12.148 --> 05:13.867
the Vulcans might have done
the same thing.

05:14.107 --> 05:16.546
The Vulcans may have good reason
for keeping an eye on them.

05:16.746 --> 05:18.066
I've seen the reports.

05:18.266 --> 05:21.105
These Andorian commandos
are a dangerous group.

05:21.385 --> 05:24.344
That's the same crap the Vulcans
used to say about us.

05:24.544 --> 05:26.984
Jon, you're doing
a lot of good work.

05:27.224 --> 05:28.903
But you've gotta be more careful.

05:29.702 --> 05:33.181
Earth can't be getting involved
in inter-species conflicts.

05:35.621 --> 05:37.500
I understand.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.179
I'm afraid I've got
some more bad news.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.773
Come in.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.851
Have a seat.

06:15.009 --> 06:17.608
I just spoke with Admiral Forrest.

06:21.887 --> 06:24.646
There's no easy way to say this.

06:26.206 --> 06:29.844
The Andorians destroyed
the sanctuary at P'Jem.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.802
Were there any survivors?

06:36.522 --> 06:39.202
Fortunately, the monks

06:39.402 --> 06:43.680
and the intelligence operatives
were given advance warning.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.200
They're fine.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.479
Was there time to remove
any of the relics?

06:47.679 --> 06:49.119
I don't know.

06:50.438 --> 06:53.638
The High Command believes
we're to blame for this.

06:53.837 --> 06:55.597
They're...

06:58.036 --> 07:01.875
...sending a ship
to take you back to Vulcan.

07:02.075 --> 07:04.114
It'll be here in two days.

07:09.153 --> 07:11.392
I won't have time to complete
my scans of this sector.

07:11.592 --> 07:14.551
I'll ask Ensign Mayweather
to finish them.

07:15.431 --> 07:17.910
Maybe I wasn't clear.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.989
This isn't a temporary transfer.

07:23.189 --> 07:24.428
They're reassigning you.

07:25.108 --> 07:27.788
I understand the situation, captain.

07:27.987 --> 07:31.266
I'm certain the High Command
will find you a suitable replacement.

07:32.106 --> 07:34.785
Am I the only one
who has a problem with this?

07:34.985 --> 07:38.024
Because you seem perfectly fine.

07:38.464 --> 07:42.943
My assignment to the Enterprise
was only supposed to last eight days.

07:43.143 --> 07:47.341
It was unrealistic to expect it
to continue indefinitely.

07:47.581 --> 07:50.021
The High Command
is looking for a scapegoat,

07:51.100 --> 07:52.660
someone to blame.

07:52.860 --> 07:56.619
They can't punish me, so they're
taking it out on my science officer.

07:56.819 --> 08:00.817
Sounds like an emotional reaction
if you ask me.

08:02.296 --> 08:05.056
I am largely responsible
for what happened.

08:05.256 --> 08:07.255
Don't give yourself too much credit.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.174
I was the one who found
P'Jem in the database,

08:10.375 --> 08:12.374
and I led the landing party.

08:12.574 --> 08:15.093
I want you to know I'm filing
a protest with the High Command.

08:15.613 --> 08:18.612
- That won't make any difference.
- You don't know that.

08:18.852 --> 08:23.370
Captain, I was assigned to Enterprise
not simply as an observer,

08:23.610 --> 08:27.209
but to represent the interests
of the Vulcan people.

08:27.449 --> 08:31.687
It's clear in the eyes of my superiors,
I haven't done that.

08:32.087 --> 08:34.886
They have no right to do this to you.

08:37.006 --> 08:39.246
You're a part of my crew.

08:40.006 --> 08:42.164
For another 48 hours.

08:46.844 --> 08:48.643
Was there anything else?

08:50.442 --> 08:51.562
No.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.879
This is just another part
of the joke, right?

09:02.079 --> 09:04.758
I'm sorry, Trip, I've gotta take
T'Pol on this one.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.798
I need to spend some time
with her alone.

09:07.997 --> 09:10.596
Now I know you're pulling my leg.

09:11.556 --> 09:13.715
T'Pol's being transferred.

09:13.915 --> 09:15.715
A Vulcan ship's on its way
to take her back.

09:15.915 --> 09:17.594
What?

09:17.794 --> 09:19.753
Meet me for lunch. I'll fill you in.

09:24.152 --> 09:26.151
May I?

09:28.791 --> 09:30.910
I just heard about your transfer.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.949
I'm sorry you'll be leaving us.

09:35.548 --> 09:39.308
I'm sure you'll excel at whatever
new assignment you're given.

09:39.508 --> 09:41.667
I haven't received
another assignment.

09:43.107 --> 09:45.186
I assumed you were
being promoted.

09:45.426 --> 09:47.345
My superiors believe
that I'm responsible

09:47.545 --> 09:50.225
for the destruction
of the P'Jem sanctuary.

09:50.705 --> 09:52.784
Do you agree
with their assessment?

09:54.663 --> 09:57.142
It's the logical conclusion.

09:57.783 --> 10:00.182
I'm certain the High Command
would reconsider your transfer

10:00.421 --> 10:03.300
if they knew everything
you've done for this crew.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.780
You realize you're not
the first Vulcan officer

10:05.980 --> 10:07.779
to be posted aboard
a human starship.

10:09.858 --> 10:11.658
The High Command
has tried this before,

10:11.858 --> 10:14.697
but none of the others lasted
more than a few weeks.

10:14.897 --> 10:19.296
They found their crewmates
too chaotic and unpredictable.

10:19.496 --> 10:21.255
But you've been here
more than six months,

10:21.455 --> 10:24.214
and you haven't
merely tolerated this crew.

10:24.414 --> 10:26.574
You've become part of it.

10:26.814 --> 10:30.452
Isn't it "logical" to take pride
in that accomplishment?

10:31.052 --> 10:33.972
Pride is a human indulgence.

10:35.651 --> 10:37.770
I suppose it is.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.249
Oh, I have it on good authority
that several crew members

10:41.489 --> 10:43.289
are planning a gathering
in your honour.

10:43.528 --> 10:46.567
I believe it's called
a "going-away party."

10:46.767 --> 10:49.807
I'd keep on alert if I were you.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.641
So,

11:10.521 --> 11:13.000
what do you know about Coridan?

11:13.199 --> 11:15.119
There are three billion inhabitants,

11:15.318 --> 11:18.958
mostly concentrated in several cities
in the equatorial region.

11:19.158 --> 11:21.797
I wasn't asking for the statistics.

11:22.236 --> 11:24.077
Your people have been
coming here for decades.

11:24.277 --> 11:26.755
You must know something
about their culture,

11:27.235 --> 11:29.874
the kinds of food they eat,
what they do for fun.

11:30.075 --> 11:33.154
The Vulcan database
doesn't contain that information.

11:34.033 --> 11:35.393
Of course not.

11:36.832 --> 11:39.392
I'm uncertain why I was chosen
for this mission.

11:40.591 --> 11:44.190
These people have
never seen humans before.

11:44.391 --> 11:47.989
It makes sense for someone with a
familiar face to make the introductions.

11:49.828 --> 11:53.108
I have a lot of work to complete
before the Vulcan ship arrives.

11:53.348 --> 11:54.747
Don't worry.

11:54.987 --> 11:57.866
I'll get you back in plenty of time.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.304
I just...

12:03.504 --> 12:07.743
...thought you might enjoy
one final mission with your captain.

12:11.062 --> 12:15.061
Or maybe I should just
take you back to Enterprise.

12:16.780 --> 12:18.580
We're only a few minutes
from the capital.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.339
Returning to the ship now
would be a waste of fuel.

12:33.735 --> 12:35.975
Enterprise to Captain Archer.

12:36.855 --> 12:37.854
Go ahead, Trip.

12:38.094 --> 12:41.333
We're reading a ship
closing on you, fast.

12:42.373 --> 12:45.692
- I got it.
- Some kind of fixed-wing aircraft.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.971
Did the chancellor say anything
about sending an escort?

12:50.491 --> 12:52.410
I don't think they're an escort.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.689
Alien vessel.
Reduce to one-quarter power

12:54.889 --> 12:57.249
and adjust heading to 317-mark-5.

12:57.449 --> 12:59.648
I'm taking evasive action.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.286
Bring the plasma weapons online.

13:02.526 --> 13:04.486
- Ready.
- Fire.

13:29.598 --> 13:32.198
Houdini could get out of this.

13:32.398 --> 13:35.517
Perhaps you should invite him
on your next mission.

13:35.757 --> 13:38.076
Harry Houdini was a magician,

13:38.276 --> 13:40.036
an escape artist.

13:40.835 --> 13:45.114
He was famous for being able to free
himself from any kind of restraint.

13:45.314 --> 13:48.833
Rope, chains, anything.

13:49.033 --> 13:51.992
That seems unlikely.

13:52.591 --> 13:55.471
That's why he was called
a magician.

13:56.151 --> 13:58.870
Some people say
he was double-jointed.

14:01.230 --> 14:04.548
I don't suppose Vulcans
are double-jointed.

14:04.748 --> 14:06.987
Unfortunately not.

14:19.104 --> 14:22.143
A Vulcan.
What brings you to Coridan?

14:22.663 --> 14:24.382
If you want answers, talk to me.

14:24.982 --> 14:28.341
- You're her superior?
- That's right.

14:28.621 --> 14:30.381
I don't recognize your species.

14:31.020 --> 14:34.019
I'm human, from the planet Earth.

14:34.259 --> 14:37.539
Never heard of Vulcans
taking orders from anyone.

14:39.258 --> 14:41.297
There's been a misunderstanding.

14:41.577 --> 14:43.897
We're here at the invitation
of your chancellor.

14:44.097 --> 14:45.976
She's not my chancellor.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.015
That government is kept
in power by the Vulcans.

14:49.614 --> 14:52.414
If you're with them,
you're on the wrong side.

14:54.973 --> 14:57.173
What kind of weapon is this?

14:59.572 --> 15:02.890
- If you won't tell me...
- It's a phase-pistol.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.770
We'll put these to good use.

15:07.889 --> 15:11.088
I'm curious about your starship.
What can you tell me about it?

15:11.489 --> 15:14.847
Our protein resequencer
can make chicken sandwiches.

15:17.006 --> 15:20.366
Stop! He's not a tactical officer.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.685
He's the ship's steward.

15:27.604 --> 15:32.321
We're here to prepare
a banquet for your chancellor.

15:35.281 --> 15:38.480
Your people have a reputation
for truthfulness.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.840
You wouldn't be lying to me,
would you, Vulcan?

15:44.078 --> 15:47.158
Oh, now I understand.
You're the captain, aren't you?

15:49.557 --> 15:51.276
Perhaps.

15:52.396 --> 15:53.915
Whoever you are,

15:54.116 --> 15:57.195
you picked the wrong time
for a visit.

16:09.591 --> 16:11.550
A steward?

16:18.308 --> 16:20.667
We believe your shuttle
was forced down

16:20.867 --> 16:22.827
by members of a radical faction.

16:23.027 --> 16:26.546
But since the attack took place
outside our sensor grid,

16:26.746 --> 16:29.424
your oficers won't be easy to find.

16:29.664 --> 16:33.783
- You didn't tell us about any factions.
- They're a small group.

16:34.063 --> 16:37.103
We had no idea they were capable
of an attack like this.

16:37.303 --> 16:38.702
But be assured, commander,

16:38.942 --> 16:41.661
your people are
almost certainly still alive.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.140
"Almost certainly"?

16:43.340 --> 16:46.780
The radicals will want something
in exchange for the hostages.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.139
They always do.

16:48.339 --> 16:50.778
Sidearms, dicobalt explosives.

16:50.978 --> 16:54.018
It's important that you
don't give them anything.

16:54.257 --> 16:55.897
Is this how you protect
your visitors?

16:56.097 --> 16:59.256
You might have told us about your little
war before you invited us down.

16:59.496 --> 17:03.374
We're not at war, commander.
This is an isolated incident.

17:03.614 --> 17:06.854
I don't care what you call it. We just
wanna know where our people are.

17:07.094 --> 17:11.732
We are doing everything
in our power to find them.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.891
We're not gonna sit on our hands
and wait for a ransom note.

17:16.131 --> 17:18.170
Start scanning for human
and Vulcan bio-signs.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.770
There are billions of people
down there. It could take days.

17:21.010 --> 17:22.729
It might be easier
to locate the shuttlepod.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.008
I'll try, but if the pod's
been powered down,

17:25.208 --> 17:28.567
it's almost impossible
to pick up its signature.

17:29.207 --> 17:31.366
We've gotta start somewhere.

17:33.926 --> 17:36.245
- Ready?
- Yes.

17:36.445 --> 17:37.524
Go.

17:38.444 --> 17:40.003
Easy.

17:46.641 --> 17:49.281
Come on. Go.

18:04.557 --> 18:07.075
I think we got
a little higher that time.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.115
Only a few centimetres.

18:10.315 --> 18:13.434
That's not frustration
I hear in your voice.

18:14.913 --> 18:17.593
- No.
- Good.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.352
Let's try it again.

18:19.552 --> 18:22.231
One, two, three.

18:27.909 --> 18:30.388
- Ready?
- Yes.

18:30.628 --> 18:32.148
Go.

18:44.504 --> 18:47.704
I think these are starting
to come loose.

18:47.903 --> 18:49.423
How about yours?

18:50.222 --> 18:51.902
Slightly.

18:53.982 --> 18:56.061
If we can turn around,
face each other...

18:56.261 --> 18:58.740
We might be able to untie
these knots.

19:06.537 --> 19:08.537
You'd think that Vulcan database

19:08.777 --> 19:11.976
might've mentioned these people
were fighting a civil war.

19:12.176 --> 19:14.616
The database is accurate.

19:14.816 --> 19:19.733
The Coridan government
doesn't view this as a civil war.

19:19.933 --> 19:22.773
I imagine your people are gonna
want their database back too.

19:22.973 --> 19:24.812
Well, they can have it.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.769
Can you reach the knot?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.248
I believe so.

19:42.287 --> 19:45.206
Without the database,
you wouldn't have found this planet.

19:46.366 --> 19:47.365
Or P'Jem.

19:47.605 --> 19:50.685
You're not responsible
for what happened.

19:52.724 --> 19:55.283
You didn't have any idea
that your people

19:55.483 --> 19:58.802
had installed a listening post,

20:00.801 --> 20:05.680
or that there were Andorian
commandos there.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.599
Enterprise had no good reason
to visit a Vulcan sanctuary.

20:11.799 --> 20:16.716
I had the opportunity to protest,
but I chose not to.

20:20.916 --> 20:23.155
It's clear that living among humans

20:23.354 --> 20:27.794
has caused my reasoning
to become compromised.

20:28.033 --> 20:29.793
Well, I think I understand.

20:30.033 --> 20:32.952
You're running away

20:33.152 --> 20:35.711
because you're afraid
to become one of us.

20:36.311 --> 20:38.230
I am not running away.

20:38.430 --> 20:40.950
Then why aren't you fighting
this transfer?

20:49.947 --> 20:52.666
Your people took something away

20:53.305 --> 20:55.425
from my father
that meant a lot to him.

20:55.665 --> 20:57.584
They're not gonna do
the same thing to me.

21:45.850 --> 21:47.290
Go get his weapon.

21:48.009 --> 21:49.728
Stop!

22:01.445 --> 22:03.484
It's definitely a ditanium signature,

22:03.684 --> 22:06.204
about four kilometres
outside the capital.

22:06.404 --> 22:08.043
It's practically under their noses.

22:08.243 --> 22:12.403
From what we can tell, the entire
capital is surrounded by a shantytown.

22:12.602 --> 22:14.761
There are almost as many
bio-signs on the outskirts

22:14.961 --> 22:16.401
as there are inside the city.

22:16.641 --> 22:20.160
Looks like these people have a lot
to learn about building a free society.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.519
Have you found human
or Vulcan bio-signs?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.918
- Not yet.
- What about the pod's transponder?

22:25.118 --> 22:26.758
They must've switched it off. Sir,

22:26.958 --> 22:29.397
I've got a rescue team
standing by in the launch bay.

22:29.837 --> 22:33.035
Now, hold on, Malcolm.
We don't even know if this is our pod.

22:33.275 --> 22:36.315
I don't wanna go down
and find it's some alien tractor.

22:36.515 --> 22:39.953
It's our shuttlepod. I'm certain of it.

22:40.193 --> 22:43.593
All I'm suggesting is we go down
and have a look around.

22:43.793 --> 22:46.152
Sir, we're being hailed. Audio only.

22:46.392 --> 22:48.991
- Who is it?
- I can't tell.

22:49.191 --> 22:50.831
Put them through.

22:52.990 --> 22:55.749
- Is this Enterprise?
- Yes.

22:55.989 --> 22:57.029
And you are?

22:57.229 --> 22:59.308
We're holding your captain
and your steward.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.388
In exchange for their safe return,
we want 40 of your phase weapons,

23:02.587 --> 23:05.746
the same type we found
aboard your shuttle.

23:06.226 --> 23:08.225
You'll be hailed
at this time tomorrow.

23:08.425 --> 23:10.105
Wait, let me talk to the captain.

23:10.305 --> 23:13.264
I'm sure you wouldn't want
any harm to come to her.

23:13.504 --> 23:15.143
We'll rely on your full compliance.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.062
- Hello?
- They've cut transmission.

23:19.302 --> 23:23.300
- Were you able to trace it?
- They were using a triaxilating signal.

23:23.541 --> 23:25.940
They called the captain "her."

23:26.180 --> 23:28.019
Are we sure they've got
the right hostages?

23:28.299 --> 23:31.339
- It sounds like they're still alive.
- For how long?

23:31.579 --> 23:34.058
We don't have 40 phase-pistols.
We've got 15.

23:34.258 --> 23:37.616
And even if we give them, there's no
guarantee they'll keep their word.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.536
We know where the shuttle is.

23:39.736 --> 23:44.214
We have to send a team down while
we still have the element of surprise.

23:45.415 --> 23:49.333
- We're getting another transmission.
- Probably thought of something else.

23:49.573 --> 23:53.052
It's not from the planet. It's coming
from a Vulcan ship, the Ni'Var.

23:55.411 --> 23:57.170
Put it up.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.689
Where's Captain Archer?

24:01.929 --> 24:04.528
He's not here right now.
Can I help you?

24:04.728 --> 24:07.408
Inform him that we'll be arriving
within the hour.

24:08.368 --> 24:09.687
You guys made great time.

24:09.887 --> 24:11.806
We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

24:12.046 --> 24:14.646
You obviously made an error
in your calculations.

24:14.886 --> 24:19.284
Please have Sub-commander T'Pol
ready to depart when we arrive.

24:21.324 --> 24:24.922
We've got a bit of a problem.

24:25.402 --> 24:26.562
She's not here either.

24:27.161 --> 24:30.881
They were on their way to the capital
city when they were kidnapped.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.440
- How convenient.
- I'm telling you, they were kidnapped.

24:35.719 --> 24:36.879
How do you know this?

24:37.119 --> 24:39.878
Maybe the ransom demand
we just received gave us a clue.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.957
They threatened to kill them both
if we didn't give them what they want.

24:43.197 --> 24:46.236
It would be irrational
to kill the hostages.

24:46.516 --> 24:48.995
They would lose
their negotiating position.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.794
Maybe we're not dealing with the most
rational people, you consider that?

24:53.434 --> 24:56.793
Since the situation involves
a Vulcan oficer,

24:56.993 --> 24:58.752
we will take over the investigation.

24:59.272 --> 25:02.990
It would be best if you refrained
from any foolish endeavours.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.310
What the hell's that supposed...?

25:07.350 --> 25:11.189
I'm getting real sick of being cut off.

25:21.225 --> 25:24.064
Your vessel is ill-equipped
to mount a rescue mission.

25:24.264 --> 25:27.784
You would, most likely,
become captives yourselves.

25:28.303 --> 25:30.942
My team will penetrate
their base of operations.

25:31.182 --> 25:34.342
- What does that mean?
- You're planning an assault.

25:34.582 --> 25:37.500
Did it ever occur to you that
that could get them killed?

25:37.700 --> 25:39.660
We've dealt with this sort
of threat in the past.

25:39.860 --> 25:43.978
Swift, decisive action
is the logical response.

25:44.258 --> 25:45.858
You're awfully trigger-happy
for someone

25:46.058 --> 25:47.378
who's repressed his emotions.

25:47.578 --> 25:49.657
They've threatened the life
of a Vulcan officer.

25:49.857 --> 25:53.255
We must discourage any such
incidents in the future.

25:53.456 --> 25:54.976
This isn't your planet.

25:55.176 --> 25:58.014
Maybe the Coridan government
has something to say about this.

25:58.254 --> 25:59.893
I've been in contact
with the chancellor.

26:00.093 --> 26:02.493
She's given me full authority
to implement this action.

26:02.733 --> 26:04.972
You don't really care
what happens to them, do you?

26:05.412 --> 26:07.932
You probably wouldn't mind
if they got caught in the crossfire.

26:08.172 --> 26:10.811
You'd consider it payback
for what happened at P'Jem.

26:11.051 --> 26:14.049
It's not Vulcan policy
to negotiate with terrorists.

26:18.048 --> 26:20.327
Not even if it saves lives?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.646
Any data you may have

26:26.886 --> 26:31.285
on the location of your captain and
the sub-commander would be useful.

26:34.123 --> 26:37.243
Sorry. We don't have anything.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.200
Warm up the shuttlepod.

27:14.112 --> 27:15.471
We can't eat like this.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.309
Friendly.

27:45.822 --> 27:47.862
Can you pick up yours?

27:49.661 --> 27:51.380
No.

27:59.738 --> 28:01.858
Dig in, sub-commander.

28:02.058 --> 28:05.616
I don't think you'll be able to send
this back for some Plomeek broth.

28:06.056 --> 28:09.216
- I'm not hungry.
- I didn't ask if you were hungry.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.535
You need to keep up your strength.

28:12.814 --> 28:15.453
So eat. That's an order.

28:55.321 --> 28:57.200
Look at this.

29:03.599 --> 29:05.598
We're being hailed.

29:06.718 --> 29:08.198
It's the Vulcans.

29:09.197 --> 29:11.196
Here we go.

29:11.396 --> 29:13.916
This is Sopek.
Where's Commander Tucker?

29:14.156 --> 29:16.755
He's unavailable at the moment.
Can I take a message?

29:16.995 --> 29:18.954
I wanna know where
that shuttlepod was going.

29:19.194 --> 29:20.594
What shuttlepod is that?

29:20.794 --> 29:23.673
The one that left your launch bay
nine minutes ago.

29:25.872 --> 29:27.271
I really wouldn't know, sir.

29:27.512 --> 29:29.951
We get shuttlepods
coming and going all the time.

29:30.151 --> 29:32.670
It's a little like Union Station
around here.

29:32.910 --> 29:34.830
I want to know where
Commander Tucker is.

29:35.070 --> 29:37.269
I'm sorry, your transmission's
breaking up.

29:49.106 --> 29:52.504
- Not everyone lives in Emerald City.
- Yeah.

30:26.054 --> 30:28.333
You should've listened
to the Vulcan.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.733
He warned you against
doing anything foolish.

30:31.973 --> 30:34.692
What the hell are you doing here?

30:34.932 --> 30:37.171
Looking out for you pinkskins.

30:37.650 --> 30:41.690
If you had gone anywhere
near that shuttlepod,

30:41.929 --> 30:43.529
you'd have been killed.

30:43.809 --> 30:47.568
They left it in the open
for you to find.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.287
How do you know
what Sopek told me?

30:50.487 --> 30:52.206
That was a secure transmission.

30:52.446 --> 30:54.926
Sopek is the senior
Vulcan officer in this sector.

30:55.126 --> 30:58.564
Naturally, we keep him
under close surveillance.

30:58.764 --> 31:02.403
We've been monitoring all Vulcan
transmissions and ship deployments

31:02.603 --> 31:06.042
since the incident at P'Jem.

31:06.242 --> 31:08.162
We know.

31:08.402 --> 31:11.640
They're preparing
for a war against us.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.200
I'm no fan of the Vulcans,
but they're not warmongers.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.998
There's already a war going on,
and the Vulcans are in the middle of it.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.397
Several rebel factions here

31:21.638 --> 31:24.797
are working to overthrow their
government, a corrupt government

31:25.036 --> 31:28.876
that has very close ties to your
peace-loving, logical friends.

31:29.516 --> 31:34.473
So you and the rebels figure
you both have a common enemy.

31:35.353 --> 31:37.593
The hostage-takers

31:37.833 --> 31:41.031
have no plans to return
your captain or the female.

31:42.351 --> 31:44.391
Once you deliver the weapons,

31:44.631 --> 31:46.190
they'll be killed.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.229
Fortunately for you,

31:48.469 --> 31:52.508
we have a relationship
with the downtrodden here.

31:52.748 --> 31:56.067
You tried to kill us last time we met.

31:56.866 --> 31:58.707
Why are you trying to help us now?

31:58.947 --> 32:00.906
I haven't...

32:01.545 --> 32:06.744
...slept well since our encounter
at the Vulcan sanctuary.

32:06.944 --> 32:11.182
I don't like being indebted to anyone,
least of all your captain.

32:14.862 --> 32:16.581
You're right.

32:17.141 --> 32:20.220
You never would've found
that spy station without his help.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.419
Once he's free,

32:22.619 --> 32:26.858
my debt will be repaid in full.

32:27.938 --> 32:29.737
Show them.

32:35.695 --> 32:38.574
Your people are being held here.

32:39.494 --> 32:41.654
These are barracks for the guards.

32:41.894 --> 32:44.333
- How many?
- At least four inside the compound,

32:44.533 --> 32:48.252
two more up on the wall here,
and two guards outside the gate.

32:48.452 --> 32:52.610
- All armed with particle weapons.
- How did you get this level of detail?

32:52.810 --> 32:55.610
We have an operative
inside the compound.

32:57.569 --> 33:00.008
Unless he's gonna take out
these guards,

33:00.208 --> 33:03.047
you're not gonna have an easy time
getting all the way to the hostages.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.366
It's not your concern.

33:05.566 --> 33:08.085
It is if you get the captain killed.

33:08.886 --> 33:11.205
You're outnumbered four to one.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.883
Wouldn't you like to improve
those odds?

33:16.044 --> 33:18.163
They could be useful.

33:21.361 --> 33:23.681
Give them their weapons.

33:30.079 --> 33:32.838
Captain, can you hear me?

33:33.038 --> 33:35.757
- Trip?
- It's me and Malcolm, sir.

33:35.957 --> 33:38.517
We're about half a kilometre away.

33:39.356 --> 33:41.795
- Just the two of you?
- Not exactly.

33:42.035 --> 33:44.635
We met up with some old friends
down here. Andorians.

33:44.835 --> 33:47.794
Apparently, one of them thinks
he owes you a favour.

33:48.034 --> 33:50.233
He couldn't have picked
a better time.

33:50.433 --> 33:52.633
One of the people guarding you
is working with them.

33:52.872 --> 33:54.952
When he unties you,
head for the gate.

33:55.151 --> 33:57.311
It's about 20 metres
from the building you're in.

33:57.510 --> 34:01.190
Until he shows up, just sit tight.

34:01.390 --> 34:03.789
That won't be a problem.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.222
Cold, isn't it?

34:28.621 --> 34:30.341
Andorian ale?

34:32.340 --> 34:33.620
Lt'll warm you up.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.649
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's just my friend. Nothing to...

35:11.889 --> 35:13.568
Get off me.

35:13.768 --> 35:16.527
Hey, let me go.

35:52.757 --> 35:54.196
What the hell is going on?

36:15.070 --> 36:16.389
Get down.

36:19.348 --> 36:20.747
Vulcans!

36:20.947 --> 36:22.668
Did you know they were
planning to do this?

36:22.907 --> 36:27.146
- You have their com system bugged.
- Our escape plan's shot to hell.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.465
We've gotta get them out of there.

36:56.657 --> 36:58.657
Good to see you, captain.

36:58.937 --> 37:00.016
Yeah. What's going on?

37:00.216 --> 37:02.295
The Vulcans crashed
our rescue party.

37:13.252 --> 37:15.132
Thanks.

37:16.731 --> 37:19.770
I believe this is yours.

37:20.410 --> 37:23.209
It's the scanner she gave me
from the Vulcan listening post.

37:23.489 --> 37:26.808
- Seems you went to a lot of trouble.
- I'm here for only one reason:

37:27.328 --> 37:29.847
I need a good night's sleep.

37:33.606 --> 37:36.805
My debt is repaid.

38:05.996 --> 38:08.836
Your presence here is a violation
of the Tau Ceti Accords.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.755
You lecture us
about treaty violations?

38:11.955 --> 38:13.634
Put down your weapons.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.354
I know better than to lower
my guard around Vulcans.

38:16.553 --> 38:20.112
Look, we're all on
the same side here.

38:33.508 --> 38:36.948
- Let's get her to the ship.
- She's no longer your responsibility.

38:37.387 --> 38:40.386
We'll treat her on the Ni'Var.

38:41.506 --> 38:44.025
She's still my science officer.

38:46.504 --> 38:47.744
- Is the pod close?
- Yes, sir.

38:47.944 --> 38:49.343
Let's go.

39:05.098 --> 39:08.258
You should be
the one dying, not her.

39:23.973 --> 39:25.612
How is she?

39:25.852 --> 39:28.972
Her injuries were quite extensive.

39:35.650 --> 39:37.489
Will she live?

39:40.727 --> 39:42.408
I wish I could say.

39:50.565 --> 39:51.925
I know how you must feel.

39:53.164 --> 39:55.564
She saved my life once too.

39:57.043 --> 40:00.362
She can be a real pain in the ass.

40:01.161 --> 40:04.041
Stubborn, arrogant.

40:04.241 --> 40:06.680
Sometimes she makes
me angry enough,

40:06.920 --> 40:08.759
I wanna shove her out an airlock.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.438
I can understand why
the High Command's upset.

40:14.198 --> 40:18.317
But it took a lot of courage to step
in front of that plasma bullet.

40:18.757 --> 40:21.715
Do you really wanna take her
back home in disgrace?

40:22.515 --> 40:24.875
Nothing can excuse
what she did at the sanctuary.

40:25.075 --> 40:27.634
I'm not asking anyone
to pin a medal on her.

40:27.834 --> 40:31.193
All I'm asking is that
she be given a second chance.

40:37.991 --> 40:41.790
If a respected Vulcan captain
went before the High Command

40:42.030 --> 40:44.229
and made a plea on T'Pol's behalf,

40:44.428 --> 40:48.828
told them how she saved the life
of a superior officer,

40:49.547 --> 40:51.986
wouldn't they think twice
about this transfer?

40:52.227 --> 40:54.466
I can't return without her.

40:55.945 --> 40:57.625
She's suffered extreme trauma.

40:57.865 --> 41:00.464
I wouldn't advise moving her
for quite some time.

41:14.060 --> 41:17.059
I'm meeting with the
High Command in three days.

41:17.299 --> 41:20.458
Perhaps, if there's time,

41:21.378 --> 41:24.137
I'll discuss this matter with them.

41:25.257 --> 41:26.496
Thank you.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.689
What happened?

41:54.648 --> 41:56.167
You were shot.

41:56.568 --> 41:58.487
Don't you remember?

42:00.806 --> 42:02.245
Captain Sopek?

42:02.725 --> 42:05.365
He's all right, thanks to you.

42:09.523 --> 42:12.123
- I'll return to my quarters...
- You're going to have to stay,

42:12.323 --> 42:14.762
at least another 24 hours.

42:24.079 --> 42:28.238
You made quite
an impression on Sopek.

42:29.477 --> 42:33.277
I've got a feeling
he's going to talk

42:33.477 --> 42:36.755
to the High Command
about that transfer order.

42:37.795 --> 42:41.314
I'd say the odds are pretty good you're
gonna be with us for a while longer.

42:44.193 --> 42:46.473
You should've consulted me first.

42:50.751 --> 42:54.070
It's probably not too late
if you wanna catch up to him.

42:59.948 --> 43:02.108
That won't be possible.

43:04.187 --> 43:08.386
Leaving Sickbay would violate
my doctor's orders.
