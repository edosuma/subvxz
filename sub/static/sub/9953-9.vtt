00:01.418 --> 00:02.749
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.878 --> 00:05.620
When I first showed up to Haven,
I was an FBI agent.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.708
I was looking into a case,
then I found out

00:07.883 --> 00:10.124
I had not one but two...
two past lives.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.545
Tell me about Sarah.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.711
- You know, you always come back
with a different name.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.304
But underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.175
- I'm Dr. Callahan.
I'm a psychiatrist.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.010
You pushed him away on purpose.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.224
- Nathan would never have stopped
trying to save me.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.605
Duke.
What's going on?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.641
- Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.810
- When someone from our family
kills a cursed person,

00:29.988 --> 00:31.068
we kill the curse too.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.439
- My family's legacy
does not control me.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.366
- Maybe it's a Crocker family history.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.538
- My father wrote this.

00:38.664 --> 00:40.746
- "It's up to you to finish my work.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.156
You must kill her."

00:50.175 --> 00:51.881
- Happy Birthday, Dad.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.424
(sighs)

01:11.029 --> 01:12.940
Grandpa Crocker.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.992
My granddad was killed by Sarah.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.199
Audrey.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.959
Stuart Mosley.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.845
Hi.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.553
- Just can't bring myself
to pull these yet.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.391
Well, they still
got fruit on them.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.886
- Mr. Mosley,
I found your name

01:46.023 --> 01:49.732
in, uh, my grandfather's journal.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.192
It was written
on the day that he died.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.858
- You.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.198
What are you doing here?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.912
- Oh, I hate this town.

02:09.880 --> 02:14.089
I swear, if that old geezer
teleported me here, I'm gonna...

02:19.264 --> 02:20.925
Of course, no service!

02:21.099 --> 02:23.511
(1950s pop music playing)

02:28.565 --> 02:31.523
Hey, buddy,
you getting any service?

02:32.444 --> 02:35.857
- It's not that kind of party, pal.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.106
- What party?
What... what do you mean, party?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.487
(woman): Hi, Sally!

02:41.662 --> 02:43.948
- Hi!
(background chatter)

02:47.084 --> 02:50.417
- I hit it, like, 12 times...

02:52.464 --> 02:53.419
(man): How you doin'?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.251
(indistinct dialogue)
- All right!

02:55.425 --> 02:56.926
- Hey, uh...

02:57.886 --> 03:00.593
T-this is some kind
of vintage-car club, right?

03:00.764 --> 03:04.256
- Vintage?
This is a brand-new Ford Fairlane.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.683
- What year is this?
- It's 1955.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.898
It's the year you should think
about sobering up.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.608
- Hey, actually,
I think it's the year

03:15.737 --> 03:18.479
that I started drinking...
heavily.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.663
(theme music)

03:49.479 --> 03:52.016
Ain’t that a shame

03:53.275 --> 03:55.391
- Oh, hey!
My tears fell like rain

03:57.487 --> 03:59.318
Ain’t that a shame

04:01.283 --> 04:04.275
You’re the one to blame

04:06.455 --> 04:10.323
You broke my heart

04:10.459 --> 04:13.542
When you said we 7/ part

04:14.463 --> 04:16.954
- What can I get for you?
- Whatever's strong and cheap.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.082
- Looks like you could use it, Tonto.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.342
- Huh?
- The hair.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.554
Could be worse.
They call me Junior.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.174
- Good to know.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.729
- No girl is going to go
with a ground-pounding infantry grunt

04:31.897 --> 04:33.103
when she could go Navy.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.189
- Sure. You swabbies
can share housecleaning tips.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.150
- Hey, hey!
No fighting here!

04:39.321 --> 04:41.357
Stop!
Stop fighting!

04:43.033 --> 04:45.866
Stop! Stop!
- That wasn't necessary.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.861
Not your problem.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.116
- Hey, stop it! Stop it!

04:52.334 --> 04:53.494
- Whoa!

04:55.212 --> 04:57.373
- Nice save.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.417
You okay?
- Yeah. I think I'm fine.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.709
- All right, break it up!

05:00.884 --> 05:02.340
Break it up!
Show's over!

05:02.511 --> 05:04.797
- Hey, hey, break it up!
(Duke): I didn't do anything!

05:04.971 --> 05:07.383
- Sure, pal.
- I mean, this is not my fault, okay?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.809
You ever feel
like no matter where you go,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.516
somehow you always
end up in the same place?

05:19.027 --> 05:19.982
Wow.

05:20.153 --> 05:24.738
- Got any answers for me yet, kemosabe?
- Uh...

05:27.077 --> 05:31.320
- You got no lD,
some counterfeit money...

05:31.498 --> 05:35.116
And, uh, what... what is this?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.538
- At the moment, a papenNeight.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.579
- Well, today's your lucky day.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.421
- It is?
- Junior vouched for you.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.966
Said that you, uh,
saved his life.

05:48.139 --> 05:51.006
If I were you,
I'd get out of town.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.266
- Trust me, I'm gonna start
working on that right now.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.642
- Parker. Par...

06:00.777 --> 06:03.644
Uh, Claire told me
I'd find you out here,

06:03.780 --> 06:06.442
exhibiting avoidance behaviour.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.440
- I'm sure she did.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.119
Look”.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.490
I need to talk to you
about the Colorado Kid.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.577
- New theory?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.710
- What happened
to the Haven Hera/d?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.042
- Haven Hera/d?
W-what are you talking about?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.423
- The local paper, it's run by Vince
and Dave. They're brothers.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.710
- Vince has been dead a long time.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.926
Dave killed him.
- When did this happen?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.310
- About 15 years ago.
Why?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.681
- Okay.
You know when there's a Haven thing,

06:40.817 --> 06:42.523
and because I'm immune
to the Troubles,

06:42.652 --> 06:45.985
I'm the only one that knows
it's a Haven thing?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.480
- Yeah.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.241
- This is a Haven thing.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.620
- Look, I'm lost,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.455
and | just want to get home.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.372
But to do that, I need to find
a man named Stuart Mosley.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.922
And you could help me
if you did a search with your...

07:07.802 --> 07:09.508
filing cabinet.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.094
Great. Thank you.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.811
Mosley, Mosley...

07:23.944 --> 07:25.434
No Mosley.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.238
You wouldn't happen to know
a-a Sarah Vernon, by chance?

07:33.328 --> 07:35.034
(sighs)

07:36.706 --> 07:38.742
Worldwide Post Delivery.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.375
Well, they still exist.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.711
- This is bizarre.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.669
I mean, everything in Haven
is pretty much the same,

07:48.802 --> 07:51.009
except for Vince and Dave...

07:51.137 --> 07:52.217
Unless...

07:54.599 --> 07:56.305
You...

07:56.434 --> 07:58.846
You and me were...

08:00.146 --> 08:01.397
You're with Jordan.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.100
- Yeah.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.270
- Good.
Okay, that's... that's good.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.770
That's... that's good for,
um, both of you.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.275
Worldwide Post.
This is...

08:16.496 --> 08:20.330
The mailing instructions have it held
for several years until today.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.708
- What is it?
- lt's addressed to me.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.333
lt's dated...

08:27.465 --> 08:29.296
1955.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.630
- Someone 60 years ago
knew that you'd be here today?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.885
- It's from Duke.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.590
That's what's different.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.729
Duke is trapped in 1955.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.267
And it's changing Haven today.
(knocking on door)

08:44.399 --> 08:47.357
We gotta bring him back
before it gets worse.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.401
Duke's letter says
that Stuart Mosley

08:50.572 --> 08:52.233
was the last person he saw.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.605
(knocking on door)

08:53.783 --> 08:55.319
Now let's find Stuart
so he can bring Duke back

08:55.493 --> 08:57.233
before he breaks more butterfly wings.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.861
- Yeah, that guy in the past,
the sooner the better.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.454
- l'll circle around back.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.928
Stuart Mosley?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.922
- The season's almost over,
you know?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.890
I'm gonna have to pull these soon.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.268
- I'm wondering if a friend of mine
came to see you.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.261
He's tall.
He has long hair.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.352
- The man from the past.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.900
- The past?

09:34.449 --> 09:37.282
- Why, you're almost her.
You're not, of course.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.034
She was different, but...

09:40.163 --> 09:42.324
Please go.
I don't want to have another episode.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.330
- Parker, l'm...
I'm thinking that...

09:47.003 --> 09:48.118
(Mosley): Oh, my God.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.332
- Nathan?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.874
- I knew that man,
like the other one.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.258
You have to leave.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.095
Bad things happen
when I get upset like this.

10:01.434 --> 10:06.019
- Hey, ljust want to thank you
for bailing me out.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.138
I thought I was going to be in there
till the Beatles.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.228
- The who?
- Them too.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.687
(tapping on bar)

10:12.862 --> 10:15.524
You know, the thing is,
uh, I'm actually looking

10:15.657 --> 10:17.113
for an old friend of mine.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.780
And, uh, truth be told,
I'm a little low on funds.

10:23.998 --> 10:27.786
This is a real gold doubloon.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.792
My dad gave it to me.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.999
And I will trade you

10:32.132 --> 10:34.965
for whatever you've got
in your wallet right now.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.671
- I got a kid who loves pirates.
He'll get a kick out of this.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.386
(knocks on bar)
- All right.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.512
Thank you.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.651
- Got your letter.
Said you'd be here.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.992
Mosley's gotta be somewhere in 1955.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.573
But before we get him
to send us back,

11:04.706 --> 11:06.822
we gotta fix whatever you did
to change the future.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.246
- No, look, I kept a low profile, okay?

11:10.378 --> 11:13.211
I know the rules.
- The rules?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.085
- The time-travel rules.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.339
- So you've done nothing of consequence
since you've been here?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.754
- Absolutely...

11:24.309 --> 11:26.265
(groans)

11:26.436 --> 11:28.973
Okay, l-l... Mm...

11:29.147 --> 11:31.809
I may have saved
one person's life.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.977
- The bartender?
- It was instinct.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.395
- Great.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.737
If he was supposed to die,

11:39.866 --> 11:41.731
you've screwed up
the natural order.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.360
Now, even if we get home,
it is a completely different Haven.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.369
- Like the Gull could
be a frozen yogurt shop,

11:47.498 --> 11:49.830
and I could be a total douche?

11:50.501 --> 11:52.412
- Or it's a completely different Haven.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.295
- That was good.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.426
I mean, look,
Junior here is a good kid and all,

12:01.554 --> 12:05.297
but if he's supposed to die,
then he has to die.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.673
Those are the rules.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.429
- Here you go, guys.
- Thanks, bud.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.643
- A little old for a Junior, aren't you?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.682
- Real name's Roy...
Roy Crocker.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.523
(coughs)

12:22.742 --> 12:24.528
- Any relation?

12:28.122 --> 12:31.034
- That's my grandfather.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.999
- You saved your grandfather's life?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.289
- Nathan, I didn't know who he was.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.801
And according to the journal,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.043
Sarah was supposed
to kill him today.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.837
She wasn't even in that bar fight.
Hell, she's not even in Haven.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.846
- You knocked Roy off his path.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.809
I mean, maybe Sarah was supposed
to get to him at the hospital

12:50.937 --> 12:52.723
or... or run his ambulance
off the road.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.517
We'll never know
how it was supposed to happen.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.478
- He just seems so...

12:59.112 --> 13:01.774
- Harmless?
- Yeah.

13:02.615 --> 13:07.029
- Roy's like your father.
He murders the Troubled.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.573
If he lives, Dave kills Vince.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.913
- So what do you want me to do?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.202
You want me to kill
my own grandfather?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.505
Oh, my God.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.592
And maybe my Trouble ends too.

13:26.014 --> 13:26.969
Lucky me.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.177
- Kill your own to kill your Trouble.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.807
- No.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.723
I can't think of it
like killing him, okay?

13:34.856 --> 13:37.268
It's just... setting things right.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.356
I mean, he was supposed
to die anyways.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.568
In fact, I actually gave him
a little extra time.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.109
- You sure you can do this?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.654
- If I do...

13:50.246 --> 13:51.907
the future Haven
goes back to normal.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.915
Everybody wins.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.169
- I'm gonna find Stuart Mosley.

14:00.298 --> 14:03.335
You said you saw one of the Guard
at the police station?

14:03.509 --> 14:04.544
- Yeah.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.710
- Mosley's Troubled.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.678
Maybe the Guard
will know where he is.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.974
Got the ink.
May as well use it.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.184
- What are you doing out here?
- I told you I need your help.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.603
You know about PTSD,
there's a vet in there who's Troubled.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.860
- Did anybody see you?
Were you followed?

14:23.988 --> 14:27.025
- This is weird, even for you.
What's wrong?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.862
- You're a fugitive
wanted for attempted murder.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.161
You shot Reverend Driscoll?
- This is just getting worse.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.039
Look”.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.954
We're in an alternate reality.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.743
We've got a Troubled guy in there.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.753
He sent Duke and Nathan
back in time.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.919
Whatever they're doing
is screwing up Haven as we know it.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.920
- Audrey, it's completely normal
to create alternate scenarios

14:50.056 --> 14:51.762
when you are grieving.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.677
The loss of Nathan,
it was devastating for you.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.346
- What... Nathan?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.933
- He died... protecting you
from the Rev's men?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.726
- No. No, he's still alive.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.686
ljust... I need to talk
to Stuart Mosley.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.851
- Look, I don't know
about Stuart Mosley,

15:04.987 --> 15:07.148
but the Boydens have lived here
for ten years.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.984
Look, I am sure
there is a better Haven,

15:09.158 --> 15:11.615
but right now, in this one,
you are not safe.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.360
So we need to get you
out of here now.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.926
- Here you go.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.671
- Think I can be a cop one day like you?

15:33.850 --> 15:36.262
- Sure. Officer...?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.926
- Officer Wuornos.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.520
Garland Wuornos.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.695
- Yeah.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.315
You'll be a real good cop too.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.568
- Thank you, mister.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.628
(telephone ringing)

16:09.760 --> 16:13.924
(Nathan): We've got to remember
to get the locks changed on those cell doors.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.716
- Didn't know the Guard
had one of you guys.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.807
- I need you to do me a favour.
Just keep walking.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.645
- Thanks for getting me out of there.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.356
- I'm looking for Stuart Mosley.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.227
Know where I can find him?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.487
- He's arriving on the 1:15 ferry today.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.772
Poor guy.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.067
Is he as dangerous as they say?
- I'd keep my distance.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.464
(line trilling)

16:54.639 --> 16:58.427
- Meet me at the wharf at 1:00.
I got somebody for you to take care of.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.392
We've been waiting for this guy.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.555
The Troubled guy's
arriving on the 1:15.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.137
- What's his name?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.563
- Why do you always
gotta know the name?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.053
- Humour me.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.644
- The guy's name
is Stuart Mosley.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.275
- Oh, there's no way
you're killing my ride home.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.567
- He's an injured war vet.
He's in a wheelchair.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.030
But he's dangerous.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.612
- An injured vet?
No, I'm done.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.198
(chuckles)
- You don't say no, Crocker.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.078
You've killed before.
This is what your daddy did,

18:03.249 --> 18:04.329
what your daddy's daddy did.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.412
You think you're better than them?
- Yeah, I do.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.497
- Crocker.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.293
- What are you doing here?
- I'll explain later.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.590
Just get out of here.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.396
Hey.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.358
- Did you do it?

18:35.781 --> 18:36.896
- Kill him?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.609
No.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.533
Roy is supposed to murder Stuart.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.947
- What?

18:46.709 --> 18:47.949
- But he refused.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.039
My grandfather doesn't want to kill
Troubled people either.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.914
Roy Crocker is a good guy.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.423
- Who's supposed to die, remember?
Time-travel rules.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.676
- The timeline is already screwed.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.057
But maybe...

19:02.224 --> 19:04.761
maybe we can make
the future better.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.848
- We are not messing
with the time-space continuum

19:08.981 --> 19:10.972
so you can work out your daddy issues.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.271
- Okay, Nathan, I can convince Roy
to leave Haven.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.396
That way, he never has to meet Sarah,
and she doesn't have to kill him.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.778
(woman): Okay...

19:21.952 --> 19:23.362
- There he is.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.576
(man): Welcome home, son.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.959
- And he's with Sarah.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.344
Even if Stuart can send us back,
we may not have a Haven to go to

19:50.481 --> 19:53.268
if you don't fix things with Roy.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.859
- lf Sarah's here, Roy may die
whether we want him to or not.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.903
- I'll follow her,
find out what she knows,

20:00.074 --> 20:01.439
maybe get close to Stuart.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.278
- Watch yourself.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.823
She may look like Audrey,
but she's not.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.988
And apparently a killer.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.715
- I think we should talk.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.315
- Mr. Mosley?

20:36.444 --> 20:37.729
Stuart?

20:39.530 --> 20:43.569
You don't know me,
but I was hoping you could help me.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.039
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

20:52.209 --> 20:53.585
Who are you?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.707
(chuckles)

21:00.301 --> 21:03.543
- I'm a... friend.
- Wrong answer.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.302
Let me help you
find your way out.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.840
- Ow! Ah! Ugh!

21:08.976 --> 21:10.591
But I...

21:11.687 --> 21:14.019
- My patient has made more progress
in the last two weeks

21:14.148 --> 21:15.433
than he has in a year.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.815
He's very fragile, and if you've done
anything to damage him,

21:17.985 --> 21:19.191
I swear...

21:19.320 --> 21:20.981
I will throttle you.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.314
Why are you looking
at me that way?

21:25.493 --> 21:27.984
- I'm sorry. You're just...

21:28.162 --> 21:31.529
- I'm what?
- Just kind of incredible.

21:35.586 --> 21:36.917
Sorry.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.756
lMleave.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.087
- You can't call a girl incredible
and just walk away.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.586
Explain yourself.

21:49.058 --> 21:52.016
- I guess I do have
some explaining to do.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.564
- I'm just saying,
just think about leaving Haven.

21:59.026 --> 22:02.393
Think about never having to take orders
from guys like Hank again.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.402
- My family's been here
for generations.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.564
- Look, you've got your own family now
to worry about.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.278
You got a wife and kid, right?

22:08.452 --> 22:11.910
- | send them every penny I earn
so they can live in a house near Derry.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.742
- Right. And you think
they're going to be any safer

22:13.874 --> 22:15.910
when this guy Hank
comes back at you?

22:16.544 --> 22:18.250
Look, you need to get them

22:18.379 --> 22:20.870
as far away from here
as possible, all right?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.166
Take them to California.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.800
I mean, take your kid
to Disneyland.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.550
(chuckles)
- Simon would love that.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.799
Need a lot of dough
to get that far.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.056
- What if I could give you

22:32.184 --> 22:34.891
foolproof investment advice?

22:35.062 --> 22:37.804
- Says the guy
who only carries pirate money?

22:37.982 --> 22:40.394
- Says the guy
who saved your life twice.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.816
- Okay. My wife may take
some convincing, though.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.782
- Hey, convince away.
All right!

22:55.040 --> 22:58.203
Uh, where's your bathroom?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.958
- Over there.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.829
- Good man, good man.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.331
(claps hands)

23:07.553 --> 23:09.919
- Honey...

23:10.055 --> 23:14.799
How would you and Simon
like to go to California?

23:30.576 --> 23:33.488
This isn't possible.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.541
lt's exactly like myjournal.

23:40.711 --> 23:41.996
(door closes)

23:48.177 --> 23:50.008
- So there's gonna be
this thing called a microchip.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.675
Invest in it. Secondly, don't bet on the Sox
this entire century.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.433
- Well, the first time
you're in a war zone,

24:01.565 --> 24:03.066
they say you either panic,

24:03.192 --> 24:06.935
or you just focus
and know what to do.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.773
I knew what to do.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.522
l was better than the doctors sometimes.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.071
(chuckles)

24:14.203 --> 24:15.909
- Well, that's what you do, right?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.530
Handle situations...

24:20.334 --> 24:21.824
Help people.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.246
- In a way.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.839
| work with the vets in DC.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.166
- You don't live in Haven?

24:31.345 --> 24:33.711
- No. ljust got here.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.595
| just came to make Stuart comfortable.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.301
He's a unique case.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.348
My supervisor says I'm good
with the strange ones.

24:47.361 --> 24:50.819
- Well, Haven is a strange place.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.658
You don't need to be afraid
of what you can't explain.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.946
- Well, that is good advice
in any corner of the world.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.996
- So you don't...
you don't know anyone here?

25:06.505 --> 25:08.416
You don't know any Crocker?

25:13.303 --> 25:15.214
- You're my first friend.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.716
-|am?

25:25.607 --> 25:29.225
- There's something different about you.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.698
You know what I learned
on the front?

25:39.830 --> 25:42.788
That things could end
at any minute.

25:42.916 --> 25:45.783
You have to take advantage
of the time that you have.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.082
Do you believe that?

25:49.673 --> 25:50.788
- Yeah.

25:51.925 --> 25:55.588
- So here I am
on this beautiful beach

25:55.721 --> 25:57.712
with a handsome guy,

25:57.848 --> 26:00.055
and all I can think of is...

26:01.226 --> 26:02.966
we have time.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.018
- I'm sorry.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.941
I should go.

26:22.081 --> 26:25.573
- Why do I always go
for the shy ones?

26:45.896 --> 26:49.764
- You know what I found most,
um, distressing...

26:49.900 --> 26:52.516
besides the entries for years
that don't even exist yet?

26:55.697 --> 26:58.860
My obituary.

26:58.992 --> 27:03.235
"Roy Crocker survived
by his wife and son."

27:03.372 --> 27:07.411
This woman, Sarah,
is supposed to kill me.

27:07.543 --> 27:10.080
You see the date?
That's today.

27:12.548 --> 27:15.255
Now, listen,
I know about the Troubles.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.922
So why don't you tell me who you are
and what's going on?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.257
- I'm from the future.

27:21.431 --> 27:24.047
My name is Duke...

27:25.686 --> 27:26.926
Crocker.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.683
And I'm your grandson.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.474
Simon is my father.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.647
When the blood of a Troubled person
touches our skin,

27:36.822 --> 27:38.778
our eyes turn silver.

27:40.659 --> 27:45.119
Because killing curses
by killing the Troubled

27:45.247 --> 27:47.408
is what we are supposed to do.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.283
Roy...

27:51.420 --> 27:53.251
I'm your grandson.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.212
I don't want this power
any more than you do.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.092
Roy, you don't have to die today.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.966
We can change our fate.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.636
- You're right.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.603
I can change my fate.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.149
Simon can't grow up
without a dad.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.605
- No.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.691
- It's the only way.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.236
l have to kill Sarah
before she kills me.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.117
- Roy, don't do this.
Think about the future!

28:26.288 --> 28:28.700
- Oh, I am thinking
about the future.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.037
(muffled shouting)

28:34.838 --> 28:36.920
- Roy found myjournal.
- What did you tell him?

28:37.049 --> 28:38.129
- I told him the truth,

28:38.300 --> 28:40.211
that we were from the future
and that l was his grandson.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.886
- So he thinks you're nuts.

28:42.012 --> 28:45.049
- No. Worse.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.430
He believed me.

28:47.601 --> 28:51.059
Nathan, he saw that Sarah kills him,

28:51.188 --> 28:53.349
so he went to kill her first.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.191
If that happens--
- He kills Lucy and Audrey too.

29:00.322 --> 29:03.155
- Jordan said to ditch the car
to make sure we aren't followed.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.025
- Hey, Jordan's helping us?
- Among others, yes.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.612
The Guard used to smuggle people into Haven.
Now they smuggle people out.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.914
The Guard is everywhere.
- It isn't supposed to be this way.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.032
- That's what you say.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.169
Listen, I'm supposed to say
that you're delusional,

29:17.297 --> 29:21.290
but you're Audrey Parker.
You see things the rest of us don't.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.335
- Thank you.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.296
- Come on,
this man can help us.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.599
- Lady slipper orchids.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.888
Beautiful and very rare.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.103
People thought
they were extinct,

29:35.232 --> 29:38.099
but it turns out they were
just dormant,

29:38.235 --> 29:39.645
waiting to bloom.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.773
I know your platoon

29:46.910 --> 29:49.572
disappeared when you were
under heavy fire.

29:51.039 --> 29:54.406
You must have thought
that they died or abandoned you.

29:55.544 --> 30:00.163
But one year later,
they walked out of the jungle

30:00.299 --> 30:02.290
thinking that only seconds
had passed,

30:02.426 --> 30:05.168
not knowing the war
was even over.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.546
Maybe they were
just dormant too,

30:08.682 --> 30:11.048
waiting until it was safe.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.181
Stuart, someone told me

30:15.314 --> 30:18.772
you don't need to be afraid
of what you can't explain.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.693
- Chief Wuornos?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.113
- Well, I'm not the Chief,
not anymore.

30:32.414 --> 30:35.952
- He found out you were in trouble,
and he insisted he help.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.286
- I don't want you to worry.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.203
We're gonna get you to a nice,
safe place, okay?

30:41.757 --> 30:44.499
- You're willing to risk your lives
even in this Haven?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.883
- "In this Haven"?

30:47.012 --> 30:50.675
Okay, Claire was saying that you thought
we were in the wrong one?

30:50.807 --> 30:53.594
- I know it sounds crazy, but--
- Not coming from you.

30:55.062 --> 30:58.475
Well, what's this other Haven?
What's it like?

30:59.858 --> 31:02.349
- Nathan's alive.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.193
He's just... he's gone.
He's, um...

31:05.322 --> 31:08.109
- He's gone?
- He's fixing a mistake in the past.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.698
- Well, let's just hope
that your Haven's the real Haven

31:10.827 --> 31:12.863
and that Nathan's alive,

31:12.996 --> 31:15.203
because a son should outlive
his father.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.870
Wait. How did you know you were--

31:19.002 --> 31:22.369
- It's all over your face.
Never mind, let's go.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.622
- Freeze!
(gun cocks)

31:31.765 --> 31:34.723
(Sarah): You are benefiting
from the fresh air.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.183
I don't think you realize,
but you're doing a very good--

31:37.354 --> 31:39.766
- Sarah.
(gaSDS)

31:39.940 --> 31:41.350
- What are you doing here?

31:41.525 --> 31:43.265
- I'm here because you're not safe.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.728
- I don't understand.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.768
- There's a man coming to kill you.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.823
- Why would anybody want to kill me?

31:48.990 --> 31:50.901
- There are people here
that think you're a threat.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.575
But I'm from Haven.
I know this place.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.616
And in a way, I know you too.
Just... look at me.

31:57.791 --> 32:02.251
You have the strongest intuition
of anybody I've ever met.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.042
And you may not know why,
but you trust me.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.089
-ldo.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.007
I trust you.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.760
- Sarah, you need to run.

32:16.351 --> 32:18.387
- No, I can't...
I can't leave Stuart.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.427
- l'll guard him with my life.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.930
Take this.
Go through the basement.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.894
There's a man named Duke
waiting for you.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.854
He has long hair,
but you can trust him.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.111
Just take whatever car you can and drive.
And don't stop driving

32:30.240 --> 32:33.232
until you hear a man named Roy Crocker
is dead, do you understand?

32:35.162 --> 32:37.073
- Yes.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.220
- That's in case
I never see you again.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.301
- You will.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.566
- Sarah, come. It's okay.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.113
- Duke, stop!

33:18.997 --> 33:21.909
Sarah Vernon?
- Oh, you must be Roy.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.289
(guns cock)

33:24.211 --> 33:26.372
- Roy, don't do this.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.340
- It's nothing personal, sweetheart,
just simple self-preservation.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.054
- Women's Army Corps.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.344
I know about self-preservation too.

33:41.061 --> 33:44.053
I've seen what killing does to a man.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.645
It makes you hollow.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.897
- Wait, stop!
Just listen to me.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.730
It doesn't have to be like this.
Just put the guns down.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.437
- | will if she will.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.406
- We'll do it together.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.794
- Sarah! No!

34:34.698 --> 34:36.654
- I know you were trying to help.

34:38.535 --> 34:40.275
But we can't escape our fate.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.575
It's in our blood.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.045
(girl): Bake sale's after school!

34:58.972 --> 35:00.508
(background chatter)

35:00.682 --> 35:03.344
- What if this is how it always happened?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.304
I mean, either way...

35:05.478 --> 35:08.561
it all went down exactly
how it was supposed to, right?

35:08.690 --> 35:11.227
Except we're still stuck here.

35:11.401 --> 35:14.188
I'm gonna go outside
for a minute.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.154
- I killed that man.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.414
| save people.
I don't hurt them.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.249
But I killed that man.
- You didn't have a choice.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.289
He was gonna kill you.
- Why?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.250
What did I ever do to him?
I just got here.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.213
But you knew
it was going to happen.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.334
I want answers,
and I want them now.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.549
(scoffs)

35:43.642 --> 35:47.555
- There are these people in Haven.
Some call them cursed.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.518
We call them...

35:49.648 --> 35:52.310
I call them Troubled.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.599
I'm one of them.

35:55.236 --> 35:56.646
So is Stuart.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.194
And you... you can help.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.699
You are important.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.160
Special.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.948
- And who are you?

36:10.126 --> 36:12.708
(scoffs)
- I really am...

36:12.837 --> 36:14.043
from Haven.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.878
| just didn't say when.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.175
The longer I stay here,
my Haven is getting worse.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.086
I really need your help.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.552
- His sedation's wearing off.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.681
How do | help someone Troubled exactly?

36:33.817 --> 36:36.433
- You try to reach them,
figure out how their Trouble works.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.608
- And what happened
when he sent you here?

36:40.740 --> 36:42.526
- He looked scared,

36:42.659 --> 36:45.366
like he remembered me from...

36:47.163 --> 36:48.198
HOW.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.619
- Which is why you landed in 1955.

36:53.712 --> 36:57.421
Maybe he sent them to a future
where the war was over,

36:57.549 --> 37:00.541
to what he thought
was a better place or time.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.508
Maybe he could do the same for us.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.886
- But how can I convince him
there even is a future?

37:05.014 --> 37:08.552
This is a man who lives each moment
terrified that he's going to die.

37:08.727 --> 37:13.096
Maybe if he knows that he lives
to be an old man, he can visualize that.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.933
- Oh.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.694
If this works, it's goodbye, isn't it?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.614
- I belong somewhere else.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.586
- I don't want to do this alone.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.424
- You don't have to do it alone.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.545
Go to the Haven Hera/d in town.

37:48.141 --> 37:52.851
Look for Vince and Dave Teagues.
They'll be friends.

37:52.979 --> 37:55.345
Just, um, don't take any crap from them.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.643
- That's not her style.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.226
- Yeah, I can see that.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.114
- Audrey, please tell me
this is one of your delusions.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.622
- | wish I could.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.116
Don't take them.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.375
Take me.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.920
Please.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.294
- Someone's gotta clean up this town.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.676
- Stuart...

38:34.813 --> 38:36.474
You don't have to be afraid.

38:38.525 --> 38:39.981
This is you.

38:41.611 --> 38:45.479
You grow to be an old man
surrounded by family and loved ones.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.698
Look,see?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.909
This is your garden.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.904
- That's me.
How?

38:54.040 --> 38:56.827
- Just imagine it.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.539
These two men,
they're there with you.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.045
And they need your help
to get home.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.882
Think of your future.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.844
Think of how happy you'll be.

39:14.143 --> 39:16.805
- l'm safe.
(laughs)

39:18.356 --> 39:20.017
I'm home.

39:20.817 --> 39:24.184
(cries)

39:26.155 --> 39:27.440
- Shh.

40:02.859 --> 40:03.894
(quietly): Go.

40:07.614 --> 40:10.947
Um, hi.
Excuse me.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.859
- Why, you are like her.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.993
But you're not, of course.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.655
She was different.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.790
- I actually was just trying to...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.956
l was trying to get back to the highway.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.997
- Ah. Head west.
You're almost there.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.131
- Great. Thank you.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.764
- We tried to make things better, but...

40:39.020 --> 40:41.056
it didn't matter.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.650
Everything that happened was already decided.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.892
It was...

40:48.821 --> 40:50.027
fate.

40:50.198 --> 40:53.315
- Hey, whatever you did,
it was the right thing.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.157
- I told Sarah to kill my own grandfather.

41:03.419 --> 41:06.001
- Sarah?
(car door opens)

41:07.006 --> 41:09.042
Did you meet her?

41:09.175 --> 41:11.211
- We were kind of her first case.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.255
(chuckles)

41:13.388 --> 41:17.381
She and Stuart,
they helped get us home.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.968
- What was she like?

41:20.687 --> 41:24.350
Was she married?
Did she have, um, a family?

41:24.524 --> 41:27.140
She just got to Haven.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.016
She was a nurse.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.729
She, um...

41:32.865 --> 41:34.241
she was alone.

41:34.367 --> 41:37.655
- Did she mention anything
about having a son?

41:38.705 --> 41:40.036
- What's going on?

41:40.206 --> 41:42.413
- I didn't know
how I was going to tell you this,

41:42.583 --> 41:44.710
so I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna say it.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.872
When I was Sarah, I had a baby.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.504
The Colorado Kid is my son.

41:59.392 --> 42:02.054
- Hello, Captain.
l-l made it to Maine.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.687
No, I like it here.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.764
lt's... it's hard to explain, but I...

42:07.942 --> 42:10.558
I think that I could do
a lot of good in Haven.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.319
- If you're asking me if you can stay,

42:13.489 --> 42:15.571
I think it's a great idea, Sarah.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.195
- Thank you, sir.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.987
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
