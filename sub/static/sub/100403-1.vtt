You see, this nigga

07:58.861 --> 08:01.360
When the last time this nigga had

08:01.362 --> 08:03.696
Feeding time.

08:03.698 --> 08:06.499

Oh, nigga,

So I take Tamika to
Dockweiler Beach, right?

This bitch start the day off
telling a lie so foul,

08:16.744 --> 08:20.112
if I said the shit right now,
it would open up a new dimension

08:20.114 --> 08:21.848
or some CERN-type shit.

08:21.850 --> 08:25.384
All I'ma say is, this bitch gonna try and tell me

08:25.386 --> 08:28.121
that I didn't see some shit
I clearly seen her do,

08:28.123 --> 08:31.424
and the reason was because she said it
was a full moon, and motherfuckers see

08:31.426 --> 08:34.260
all kind of crazy shit
during a full moon.

08:34.262 --> 08:36.862
I'm looking up, I'm like,
"But, bitch, it's daytime."

08:36.864 --> 08:39.498

- High noon in this motherfucker.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.234

08:42.236 --> 08:44.536
That's what I mean.
Unnecessary-ass lies.

Now y'all know me.
I'm usually cool, calm,

08:47.008 --> 08:48.641

08:48.643 --> 08:50.609
But this nigga's sister

08:55.582 --> 08:57.751

09:01.255 --> 09:03.189
I was like,
"So? Call that nigga."

09:03.191 --> 09:05.724
When she called you and told
you what happened, nigga,

09:05.726 --> 09:08.727

09:08.729 --> 09:12.799

09:12.801 --> 09:16.336
I done told her this shit more than
once, but she coming to my job, she like,

09:16.338 --> 09:18.304
"Bro, I broke everything

09:18.306 --> 09:19.905
I'm like, "What the fuck

09:19.907 --> 09:22.174
Exactly. Bragging about that

11:13.187 --> 11:15.256
Kiss my ass.

11:17.392 --> 11:19.659
Motherfucker, yo!

11:22.931 --> 11:24.233
You good?

11:28.170 --> 11:30.072
Goddamn.

12:27.861 --> 12:30.531
- No, no, no. It's me, it's me. It's me.
- Emilio!

12:37.038 --> 12:38.971
<i>Sí.</i>

12:48.649 --> 12:49.784
<i>Vámonos.</i>

12:56.124 --> 12:57.857
Oscar?

13:01.797 --> 13:04.164
Police! Open up!

13:09.637 --> 13:11.637
- Freeze!
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:11.639 --> 13:13.705
Hey, drop it, or I'll shoot.

13:13.707 --> 13:17.612
- I said drop it, buddy!
- All right. I'm dropping the gun, all right?

14:27.181 --> 14:29.115
Evening.

14:29.117 --> 14:32.050
We're doing a sweep of the
neighborhood for some kids involved

14:32.052 --> 14:33.852
in a nearby
gang shooting.

14:33.854 --> 14:35.788
Probably illegals.

14:35.790 --> 14:38.460
I'd like to come inside,
take a look around.

14:40.494 --> 14:43.195
I ain't seen no kids.

14:43.197 --> 14:44.932
I wasn't asking.

14:47.835 --> 14:50.004
You don't have a warrant.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.274
You know
I don't need one.

14:55.476 --> 14:58.746
I ain't seen
no kids, sir.

15:04.451 --> 15:06.587
<i>Unit Five, identify.</i>

15:10.591 --> 15:12.426
You stay safe, now.

15:54.268 --> 15:56.404
Are you hungry?

16:16.056 --> 16:19.894
My name is John Henry.

16:23.398 --> 16:25.734
Okay. Um...

16:27.634 --> 16:32.340
<i>Mi nombre</i> John Henry.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.111
Did I say that right?

16:38.378 --> 16:40.014
I don't know much Spanish.

16:42.984 --> 16:44.353
Berta.

16:47.122 --> 16:48.490
Berta?

16:50.392 --> 16:52.924
- John.
- Shoulda named you

16:52.926 --> 16:55.127
"dumb-ass motherfucker,"
what I shoulda did.

16:55.129 --> 16:57.329
Bringing in gutter bitches
off the street

16:57.331 --> 16:59.133
and feeding them sandwiches
and shit.

17:02.537 --> 17:05.570
BJ. <i>Padre.</i>

17:05.572 --> 17:07.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.409
Don't tell gutter bitch
my name.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.011
Don't call her that.

17:13.013 --> 17:15.280
That's where you found her, ain't it?
In the gutter?

17:15.282 --> 17:20.019
Ain't a place bitches
usually end up by accident.

17:20.021 --> 17:24.057
- Pops.
- Oh, man, this is ridiculous.

17:24.059 --> 17:28.161
Next thing, you be bringing John
Dillinger in this motherfucker.

17:28.163 --> 17:31.196
<i>Padre... loco.</i>

17:34.568 --> 17:36.069
You got family?

17:36.071 --> 17:39.038
Uh, <i>¿padre?</i>

17:39.040 --> 17:40.408
<i>¿Madre?</i>

17:46.613 --> 17:48.115
<i>Hermanos.</i>

17:49.283 --> 17:50.651
Where?

17:57.225 --> 17:59.224
I don't understand.

17:59.226 --> 18:00.795
Gone.

18:02.696 --> 18:05.500
She says they're gone, John.

18:19.914 --> 18:22.150
I lost someone today too.

18:43.937 --> 18:46.073
You can stay here
tonight.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.707
Tomorrow,
I'll see what I can do

18:49.709 --> 18:51.844
to get you somewhere safe.

18:51.846 --> 18:55.580
It's the best
I can do. <i>¿Sí?</i>

18:55.582 --> 18:57.617
Man,
she didn't understand

18:57.619 --> 19:01.087
a goddamn word you said.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.289
I was thinking maybe she could
just get the general tone

19:04.291 --> 19:06.125
of what I was saying.

19:06.127 --> 19:07.596
Tone?

19:13.134 --> 19:14.236
Tone.

19:15.668 --> 19:18.105
Goddamn.

19:46.533 --> 19:49.234
- What?
- When did you learn Spanish?

19:49.236 --> 19:51.671
1989, night school.

19:51.673 --> 19:55.473
I was getting it on
with this Puerto Rican girl

19:55.475 --> 19:57.579
I met at the swap meet.

19:58.545 --> 20:02.181
She'd talk all this
nasty shit in bed.

20:02.183 --> 20:03.982
I want to know
what she be saying.

20:03.984 --> 20:07.052
- What was she saying?
- I don't know.

20:07.054 --> 20:10.223
She caught me fucking her sister
before I finished the classes.

20:18.898 --> 20:21.032
Something wrong?

20:28.408 --> 20:30.078
Good luck.

20:30.644 --> 20:32.147
With what?

20:42.689 --> 20:44.625
First time?

20:46.561 --> 20:48.793
Is that...

20:48.795 --> 20:50.731
that you, John Henry?

20:51.565 --> 20:53.332
Tasha, Compton High.

20:53.334 --> 20:56.702
I know I gained a few
in 20 years, but...

20:56.704 --> 21:00.008
No. You haven't changed
at all.

21:00.908 --> 21:04.576
Yes, I have,
and I am proud of every pound.

21:04.578 --> 21:06.511
Put some respect
on this thickness.

21:06.513 --> 21:08.681
Sorry.

21:08.683 --> 21:10.116
No, I was...

21:10.118 --> 21:13.185
I was... I was just
playing with you.

21:13.187 --> 21:15.988
Look, a lot of fathers
come in here all nervous

21:15.990 --> 21:18.723
when their daughters
become women.

21:18.725 --> 21:21.763
I, um... I didn't know
you were one.

21:23.231 --> 21:24.965
Um, a father.

21:25.666 --> 21:29.404
No. Um,
it's for my niece.

21:30.138 --> 21:33.174
Um, she's visiting
from out of town.

21:35.275 --> 21:36.777
I'm not a...

21:37.811 --> 21:39.214
I mean...

21:40.580 --> 21:42.650
I don't have any
of my own.

21:43.951 --> 21:46.421
You don't have to be
embarrassed about that.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.090
I don't have any either.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.059
Really?

21:56.430 --> 21:58.763
So, um,

21:58.765 --> 22:00.398
what do you recommend?

22:00.400 --> 22:03.969
Um, well, if your niece
is anything like me,

22:03.971 --> 22:07.342
then I think she'd like...

22:08.309 --> 22:09.575
this one.

22:13.747 --> 22:15.883
You remember this?

22:20.687 --> 22:22.724
Do you remember this?

22:24.324 --> 22:26.157
Yes!

probably, don't I?

23:56.617 --> 23:58.386
Ah, you see me, Pops?

24:01.187 --> 24:03.789
Say you guys shouldn't
be cool or some shit.

24:03.791 --> 24:06.626
How you, like, if the cops
told you they found a body?

24:06.628 --> 24:08.226
Don't never leave
the bodies.

24:08.228 --> 24:11.062
- Don't ever leave a body?
- No, don't ever leave the bodies.

24:11.064 --> 24:13.232
Where you put it?

24:13.234 --> 24:16.635
That way, you don't never
leave their families to grieve.

24:16.637 --> 24:19.107
They always going to wonder
if they ever out there.

25:22.302 --> 25:24.872
Shit!
Get out of here! Go!

25:32.745 --> 25:34.181
I'm sorry.

25:35.115 --> 25:37.051
I didn't mean to yell.

25:39.786 --> 25:42.023
You don't
understand me anyway.

25:43.657 --> 25:45.560
Probably for the best.

25:46.994 --> 25:49.097
I never had much to say.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.270
I had a friend
back in school try to help.

25:56.838 --> 25:58.572
She did her best.

25:59.773 --> 26:03.011
But never much helped me
with words or nothin'.

26:06.179 --> 26:08.416
Did get me started drawing.

26:54.861 --> 26:58.565
I never did get the hang
of drawing dogs.

27:01.334 --> 27:03.337
Talby deserved better.

27:52.386 --> 27:54.819
That's bullshit,
and you know it.

27:54.821 --> 27:57.489
Go to sleep for a few hours
and wake up in Tijuana.

27:57.491 --> 28:00.459
She's from Honduras,
John, not Mexico.

28:00.461 --> 28:04.896
She's also
a goddamn liar.

28:04.898 --> 28:06.499
Okay, slow down.

28:06.501 --> 28:09.604
- What is she lying about, Pops?
- This bitch...

28:11.237 --> 28:13.938
Berta said
that in Honduras,

28:13.940 --> 28:16.710
they got bats
that are white.

28:18.145 --> 28:19.547
And?

28:20.680 --> 28:22.947
And she's full of shit,
that's what.

28:22.949 --> 28:26.417
Been around a long time.
I've seen a lot of fucking bats in my day.

28:26.419 --> 28:30.055
I ain't never seen
no white bat.

28:30.057 --> 28:32.460
You never been
to Honduras either.

28:33.394 --> 28:37.495
Bats are black or brown,
John.

28:37.497 --> 28:39.097
If she seen a white bat,

28:39.099 --> 28:42.134
it probably 'cause it covered
with motherfucking cocaine.

28:42.136 --> 28:44.869
Damn coked up-bats
probably flying around,

28:44.871 --> 28:48.107
- looking for a dick to suck.
- <i>Idiota.</i>

28:48.109 --> 28:49.741
That word I understood.

28:49.743 --> 28:53.114
I don't give a damn
what y'all think.

28:54.447 --> 28:57.517
Bats are black, John.
Berta.

28:58.685 --> 29:00.821
Bats are black.

29:03.057 --> 29:06.290
Too much white in the world
already, if you ask me.

30:05.285 --> 30:07.417
<i>Mi nombre...</i>

30:07.419 --> 30:09.655
Dude, I'm from Reseda.

30:09.657 --> 30:12.690
- Berta said you were her brother. I thought...
- Yeah, half.

30:12.692 --> 30:16.161
Look, I appreciate all this
hospitality and everything,

30:16.163 --> 30:17.628
but this is a family matter.

30:17.630 --> 30:19.530
I'd like to get my sister
and get out.

30:19.532 --> 30:22.401
Don't look like she wants
to go with you, hotshot.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.636
Yeah, well, she'll get over it.
<i>Vámonos.</i>

30:24.638 --> 30:26.570
No.

30:26.572 --> 30:29.206
Goddamn it. After all this
shit that I just went...

30:29.208 --> 30:31.311
Man, fuck you.

30:38.952 --> 30:40.621
All right.

30:48.028 --> 30:49.961
- What's that for?
- Your gun.

30:49.963 --> 30:51.965
Put it in the napkin.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.869
- Relax. It's not loaded.
- Doesn't matter.

30:57.236 --> 30:59.236
It does to me.
It's my gun.

30:59.238 --> 31:02.906
Inside these walls,
it's my gun.

31:04.878 --> 31:08.646
Hey, hey. Don't look to him.
You don't know him. Look to me.

31:27.367 --> 31:29.401
She says
to give you the gun.

31:29.403 --> 31:33.007
That ain't all she said.

31:35.876 --> 31:36.978
Fine.

31:41.814 --> 31:42.949
You satisfied?

32:04.538 --> 32:09.377
<i>I said,
"My boy's strong."</i>

32:21.521 --> 32:23.758
So why is she
so mad at you?

32:29.295 --> 32:32.299
- Because I left him behind.
- Who?

32:33.567 --> 32:35.403
Oscar.

32:42.341 --> 32:44.711
How 'bout we start
from the beginning?

32:48.648 --> 32:52.653
About six weeks ago,
I got this in the mail.

32:53.486 --> 32:56.721
It's from her
and her brother, Oscar.

32:56.723 --> 32:59.092
She drew the flower
on it herself.

33:02.596 --> 33:04.029
What does it say?

33:04.031 --> 33:06.699
It says
their mother was killed,

33:06.701 --> 33:08.903
so they're coming
to find their father.

33:09.869 --> 33:11.569
Which is you?

33:11.571 --> 33:13.871
When you start fucking,
boy? Nine?

33:13.873 --> 33:16.674
It wasn't meant for me.
It was meant for my father.

33:16.676 --> 33:18.542
He was in the military.

33:18.544 --> 33:21.546
Spent some time stationed
in Honduras in the '90s.

33:21.548 --> 33:23.884
Apparently, he left pieces
of himself behind.

33:28.455 --> 33:31.091
His liver gave out on him
about a year ago.

33:34.494 --> 33:37.828
Drank himself to death without
anyone even knowing he was drinking.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.867
Fucking Catholics, right?

33:43.770 --> 33:46.704
Anyways, I, uh,
got that postcard.

33:46.706 --> 33:48.973
I just figured
it wasn't my problem.

33:48.975 --> 33:52.879
Just threw it in the drawer
and... and moved on.

33:56.148 --> 33:58.084
And then yesterday...

34:03.322 --> 34:06.390
Listen, whatever you guys are
selling, I don't want it,

34:06.392 --> 34:08.360
but go ahead and pitch it.

34:08.362 --> 34:09.997
I'm bored as fuck.

34:22.174 --> 34:24.442
<i>These little shits
came all the way from Honduras</i>

34:24.444 --> 34:27.012
<i>based on nothing but a return
address on some letters</i>

34:27.014 --> 34:29.480
<i>my father sent their mother
over the years.</i>

34:29.482 --> 34:32.516
I don't know, man,
but they can't stay here.

34:32.518 --> 34:35.052
<i>Berta said if they would've
stayed, they would've been killed</i>

34:35.054 --> 34:37.355
<i>by the same gangs
that killed their mother.</i>

34:37.357 --> 34:40.159
<i>Four thousand miles packed
like cattle on trains</i>

34:40.161 --> 34:42.261
<i>on the back
of smuggling trucks,</i>

34:42.263 --> 34:44.128
<i>past the cartel and ICE,</i>

34:44.130 --> 34:46.600
<i>just to end up
on my fucking doorstep?</i>

34:48.534 --> 34:52.770
<i>Look, man. I deal pills for a
friend of mine from Hollywood.</i>

34:52.772 --> 34:54.806
<i>He was looking to move
some product in the Valley,</i>

34:54.808 --> 34:57.007
<i>and I know a lot
of junkies, so...</i>

34:57.009 --> 34:59.043
<i>I still barely get by,
you feel me?</i>

34:59.045 --> 35:01.712
<i>I got enough problems already.
I couldn't handle another.</i>

35:01.714 --> 35:03.716
All right, don't be late.

35:04.583 --> 35:07.117
<i>So what did you do?</i>

35:07.119 --> 35:09.520
<i>My friend said there
was a shelter in Hollywood</i>

35:09.522 --> 35:11.788
<i>that helps migrant kids.</i>

35:11.790 --> 35:15.830
<i>I was just gonna drop them
there and get high till the guilt faded.</i>

35:42.556 --> 35:44.558
Berta! Berta!

35:48.295 --> 35:50.197
Berta!

35:59.672 --> 36:02.107
I've seen
that cross before.

36:03.610 --> 36:07.744
<i>My connect, he used to get
his supply from a Compton gang</i>

36:07.746 --> 36:10.148
led by some dude
with a metal jaw.

36:10.150 --> 36:12.851
All his people, they have
that cross tatted on them,

36:12.853 --> 36:14.918
like some kind of brand
or some shit.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.023
But he stopped fucking with them when they
went from dealing drugs to dealing women.

36:18.025 --> 36:22.059
Look, I know I just met her,
but I got her into this shit.

36:22.061 --> 36:24.297
She's family.
I had to do something.

36:49.255 --> 36:50.989
<i>How many?</i>

36:50.991 --> 36:52.958
<i>How many what?</i>

36:53.759 --> 36:56.229
<i>How many
did you kill?</i>

37:06.540 --> 37:08.375
I think, like, six. Why?

37:09.143 --> 37:11.110
That's how many bodies
you owe.

37:33.232 --> 37:34.801
The girl.

37:43.911 --> 37:46.009
Don't make me ask you again.

37:46.011 --> 37:48.014
I didn't hear
a question.

37:52.018 --> 37:55.186
Shit. Man, what the fuck
is your problem?

37:55.188 --> 37:57.387
You told me to snatch
bitches, so I snatched them.

37:57.389 --> 38:00.893
How the fuck was I supposed to
know her brothers were shooters?

38:07.500 --> 38:09.402
<i>♪ Welcome to hell ♪</i>

38:13.072 --> 38:14.938

38:14.940 --> 38:16.877

38:22.915 --> 38:25.416

came out of nowhere, man.

38:25.418 --> 38:29.788
It was an accident, man. You know that
wasn't my fault. Man, that wasn't my fault.

38:29.790 --> 38:31.958
Say "ah," motherfucker.

38:33.692 --> 38:35.360
<i>♪ Welcome to hell ♪</i>

39:24.210 --> 39:26.479
Give her space, kid.

39:33.219 --> 39:35.485
I got her into this.
I can get her out.

39:35.487 --> 39:39.493
I think it'd be safer if you
both stay here for a while.

39:40.393 --> 39:42.692
Till things cool down.

39:42.694 --> 39:45.563
Listen, I appreciate it,
but I can manage, all right?

39:45.565 --> 39:47.100
Yeah?

39:52.005 --> 39:54.208
You know anything
about engines?

39:59.679 --> 40:01.949
It almost turned over
that time.

40:02.715 --> 40:05.384
Hold on.
I think I got it.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.022
You're a Raiders fan, huh?

40:11.891 --> 40:14.558
Since the days
of Marcus Allen.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.295
Used to sneak into games with my
cousin when I was Berta's age.

40:18.297 --> 40:21.366
My dad was
a big Raiders fan too.

40:21.368 --> 40:23.534
Couldn't believe they
brought two teams to LA,

40:23.536 --> 40:26.536
and neither was a team
that LA fucked with.

40:26.538 --> 40:28.206
Right?

40:28.208 --> 40:31.076
That they built a stadium in
Inglewood was insult to injury.

40:31.078 --> 40:33.846
- Won't let us have nothing.
- For real.

40:37.449 --> 40:39.152
How'd you find her?

40:41.154 --> 40:42.420
Berta?

40:42.422 --> 40:44.558
How did you know
which house she was in?

40:46.360 --> 40:49.527
I went with my connect on a
pickup one time down that block.

40:49.529 --> 40:52.130
I just figured it was
the best place to start.

40:52.132 --> 40:54.331
As luck would have it,
when we got there,

40:54.333 --> 40:57.971
there she was, looking out the
window like she was waiting for us.

40:59.038 --> 41:01.371
- So, good luck.
- Yeah.

41:01.373 --> 41:04.375
Must've been good luck that you
had all those guns ready too.

41:04.377 --> 41:07.279
Look, man, I already know where
you're headed with that shit,

41:07.281 --> 41:09.779
and I ain't even like that.

41:09.781 --> 41:11.949
I deal some pills
to some friends.

41:11.951 --> 41:14.353
That's as deep as I get
in that crime shit.

41:15.589 --> 41:18.525
Just asking.
No judgment.

41:21.159 --> 41:23.561
So why you helping us?

41:23.563 --> 41:25.128
Why wouldn't I?

41:25.130 --> 41:27.864
'Cause we're strangers.

41:27.866 --> 41:30.268
Because just by having us here,
you're putting yourself in danger.

41:30.270 --> 41:31.972
You have no reason to help us.

What's good, boy?

44:01.286 --> 44:03.753
Hey, yo, I was just telling
shorty about my cousin,

44:03.755 --> 44:06.523
the motherfucking killer
with the hands of steel.

44:06.525 --> 44:09.126
I bet they still cleanin' that
nigga brains off the pavement.

44:09.128 --> 44:11.962
My nigga, you stomped
his shit into spaghetti.

44:11.964 --> 44:13.965
Whole hood talkin'
about that shit.

44:13.967 --> 44:17.070
I've been calling you all day, though.
Where the fuck you been at?

44:21.206 --> 44:23.143
Hey, yo, bitches, leave.

44:34.487 --> 44:36.920
What's good, nigga?
You straight?

44:36.922 --> 44:38.357
Yeah, I'm good.

44:39.292 --> 44:41.761
Nah. Feel like you came here
to say something.

44:42.862 --> 44:44.531
Say it.

44:47.098 --> 44:48.634
I just...

44:50.002 --> 44:51.501
Let me guess.

44:51.503 --> 44:54.804
The nigga you stomped out
got you a little fucked up?

44:54.806 --> 44:58.308
It's understandable.
Hey, first body gets everybody, man.

44:58.310 --> 45:00.376
You should've seen me
after my shit, man.

45:00.378 --> 45:02.913
The first two days,
nigga, I ain't leave my room.

45:02.915 --> 45:05.751
Couldn't eat. Couldn't shit.
Couldn't sleep.

45:07.185 --> 45:08.753
Real shit.

45:10.089 --> 45:14.525
You know, I don't be telling niggas
shit like this, but you family, right?

45:14.527 --> 45:17.764
You ain't got no reason to be embarrassed.
You did good, and...

45:18.764 --> 45:21.465
my nigga, I got
the footage to prove it.

45:21.467 --> 45:23.701
Nigga, check this shit out.

45:23.703 --> 45:25.505
Whoo!

45:44.322 --> 45:47.458
Nigga, I went back and snatched
the security footage last night,

45:47.460 --> 45:49.192
just in case
anybody try to snitch.

45:49.194 --> 45:51.329
Yo, my nigga,
this shit is so raw!

45:51.331 --> 45:53.867
I bet you I could sell
this shit at the swap meet!

45:54.900 --> 45:56.500
But, hey.

45:56.502 --> 45:59.036
Real shit,
you saved my life.

45:59.038 --> 46:01.108
I ain't gonna
forget that.

46:02.674 --> 46:04.275
I'm out.

46:04.277 --> 46:07.210
You know,
you my cousin and shit,

46:07.212 --> 46:10.417
and I love you, but you acting
like a real bitch right now.

46:13.418 --> 46:16.085
What, nigga?
What I'm supposed to be scared of?

46:16.087 --> 46:18.788
Come on, nigga. You want to stop
banging after your first body?

46:18.790 --> 46:20.958
What? You know that nigga got
people, right?

46:20.960 --> 46:23.360
You know his people
gonna come for us, right?

46:23.362 --> 46:25.262
So if you scared of that
shit, yeah, you a bitch.

46:25.264 --> 46:28.465
- I don't give a fuck if you are family.
- So they come. Then what?

46:28.467 --> 46:31.569
Huh? We kill them?
More come, we kill them?

46:31.571 --> 46:34.706
More come, we kill them?
Huh? When do it stop?

46:34.708 --> 46:36.507
It stop when I'm on
the fucking throne,

46:36.509 --> 46:38.409
and you right next to me
cracking heads, nigga.

46:38.411 --> 46:42.279
We were talking about this shit since
second grade. There ain't no plan B.

46:42.281 --> 46:44.681
Ain't no way out.

46:44.683 --> 46:46.951
Nigga, I'm not gonna be
a statistic.

46:46.953 --> 46:48.755
I'ma be a fucking king.

46:49.755 --> 46:51.855
- There's other ways to make money.
- Man, fuck that.

46:51.857 --> 46:54.526
It ain't about money, nigga.
It's about respect.

46:55.594 --> 46:58.429
All right?
You got bullets for hands, nigga,

46:58.431 --> 47:00.530
and if you don't make
niggas respect that,

47:00.532 --> 47:04.335
then, shit, you might not make it to
your next birthday, nigga, real talk.

47:04.337 --> 47:06.170
Is that a threat?

47:06.172 --> 47:08.440
It's a prediction.

47:12.210 --> 47:14.511
You know what?
Hold on.

47:14.513 --> 47:16.782
I got something
that gonna change your mind.

47:27.159 --> 47:29.226
Relax, nigga.
It ain't gonna sting.

47:29.228 --> 47:30.293
I know.

47:30.295 --> 47:31.897
Go ahead.

47:33.031 --> 47:34.400
Take it.

47:35.801 --> 47:38.469
Take that shit, man.
Take the shit. Take it.

47:38.471 --> 47:40.804
<i>John! John!</i>

47:57.656 --> 48:00.090
<i>He hanged himself,
boy, I said,</i>

48:00.092 --> 48:02.559
<i>with his body on the tree,</i>

48:02.561 --> 48:06.362

48:11.804 --> 48:14.337

- He'll be right there by himself.

48:16.576 --> 48:18.842
We going everywhere now.
It ain't no sections no more.

48:18.844 --> 48:20.777
We going
wherever we want to go.

48:20.779 --> 48:23.713
We go somewhere else,
we see somebody on the corner selling dope

48:23.715 --> 48:26.083
that shouldn't be selling dope,
'cause he don't work for us.

48:26.085 --> 48:27.918
So you gonna kill
me to get the paper?

48:27.920 --> 48:30.353
You didn't see that
nigga burn that nigga. I did.

48:30.355 --> 48:32.523
Nigga, I don't want to
be on the end of that.

48:32.525 --> 48:34.558
What's that?

48:34.560 --> 48:35.960
You don't remember me, bro?

48:35.962 --> 48:37.494
Where you from?
What's happening?

48:45.436 --> 48:48.905

or there's gonna be hell to pay.

49:43.328 --> 49:46.463
Nearly broke my back trying
to get that stain out.

49:46.465 --> 49:48.335
Gram.

49:50.170 --> 49:52.036
Where is he?

49:52.038 --> 49:55.639
They don't tell me where
he go or when he coming.

49:55.641 --> 49:57.474
When's he coming back?

49:57.476 --> 50:01.080
There's no way to know, sugar.
Like I said, he don't tell me nothing.

50:02.581 --> 50:05.819

I can call you next time I see him.

50:11.022 --> 50:12.591

52:59.859 --> 53:01.828
He had
an accident...

53:02.895 --> 53:05.063
when he was young,
with a gun.

53:06.331 --> 53:07.967
What kind of accident?

53:10.368 --> 53:11.869
He shot the devil.

53:19.777 --> 53:21.915
Everything cool?

53:32.590 --> 53:34.291
Why is she smiling
like that?

53:34.293 --> 53:36.229
I don't know.

53:39.799 --> 53:41.833
Fuck he doing in there?

53:43.235 --> 53:44.936
John!

53:44.938 --> 53:48.141
Can someone in this motherfucker
tell me what is going on?

54:01.888 --> 54:04.090
I never could
get Talby right.

54:05.525 --> 54:07.193
But she did.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.793
Thank you, Berta.

54:18.837 --> 54:20.770
Dad, take Berta.

54:20.772 --> 54:23.108
I need Emilio's help
with the engine.

54:24.076 --> 54:25.777
Yeah.

54:31.851 --> 54:33.616
It's not the car.

54:33.618 --> 54:35.485
We need to talk.

54:35.487 --> 54:37.056
What's up?

54:40.525 --> 54:41.828
What's this?

54:42.594 --> 54:44.129
Your way out.

54:50.935 --> 54:53.003
Where did this come from?

54:53.005 --> 54:56.340
Doesn't matter.
Take it, take Berta,

54:56.342 --> 54:59.712
and get as far away from
here as you can, tonight.

55:01.313 --> 55:03.880
No, man. I can't take money
if I don't know the source.

55:03.882 --> 55:07.650
Especially if it comes in a bag full
of cash. How much money is in here?

55:07.652 --> 55:11.288
Fifty thousand. It's better
you not ask me where I got it.

55:11.290 --> 55:13.724
Shit, I'm not.

55:13.726 --> 55:15.592
Where'd you get
this money from, John?

55:15.594 --> 55:18.695
You bounce out,
then come back with a bag full of cash?

55:18.697 --> 55:20.833
What kind of shit
you into, man?

55:21.866 --> 55:24.967
All right. The bad-ass
with the metal jaw?

55:24.969 --> 55:27.070
- Yeah?
- He's my cousin.

55:27.072 --> 55:29.572
We've got a history,
but he's willing to look the other way

55:29.574 --> 55:32.742
as long as you leave town
in the next 24 hours.

55:32.744 --> 55:34.677
Wait, hold up.

55:34.679 --> 55:37.213
Your cousin Hell gave you

55:37.215 --> 55:39.248
a bag full of cash
to give to me?

55:39.250 --> 55:41.552
You expect me
to believe that shit?

55:41.554 --> 55:43.619
I expect you
to take the money,

55:43.621 --> 55:46.192
take your sister,
and start fresh.

55:49.527 --> 55:51.863
No, fuck that.
Why'd he give you this money?

55:54.132 --> 55:56.735
I need you
to trust me.

55:57.735 --> 55:59.205
Please.

56:10.982 --> 56:14.186
Uh, Berta would like
to say grace.

56:15.721 --> 56:17.290
Please.

56:44.150 --> 56:45.218
Amen.

56:48.420 --> 56:50.022
Amen.

56:56.529 --> 57:00.297
How come you never make no
food like this for me, son?

57:00.299 --> 57:03.266
'Cause you never drew my dog.

57:03.268 --> 57:04.534
Mmm.

57:04.536 --> 57:08.070
I'll paint the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel

57:08.072 --> 57:11.076
if I can get food like this
served every night.

57:14.545 --> 57:16.114
Was her mother an artist?

57:18.049 --> 57:20.116
I don't know.
I never thought to ask.

57:20.118 --> 57:23.054
Before you decided to get rid of
her, you mean.

57:25.458 --> 57:27.224
Your sister.

57:27.226 --> 57:30.061
Before bringing her
to the shelter.

57:30.895 --> 57:33.297
Mm. Like I said.

57:34.299 --> 57:38.436
You didn't want to have
her disrupt your lifestyle.

57:39.404 --> 57:41.271
Pills, right?

57:41.273 --> 57:42.304
Pops.

57:42.306 --> 57:45.243
Don't disturb me, son.
I'm talking.

57:46.011 --> 57:47.446
It's cool.

57:48.681 --> 57:50.550
Fine. He's right.

58:09.335 --> 58:11.735
- What's she saying about Oscar?
- Nothing.

58:18.743 --> 58:22.378
She wants to know when
they're gonna save Oscar.

58:22.380 --> 58:24.583
She says
he's still alive.

58:26.252 --> 58:27.320
Is he?

58:29.353 --> 58:31.189
Not dead.

58:34.159 --> 58:36.162
How do you know?

58:41.199 --> 58:42.234
I...

58:43.768 --> 58:45.869
I feel him.

58:45.871 --> 58:47.473
Oscar.

58:48.906 --> 58:50.575
Not dead.

58:52.344 --> 58:53.909
You see?

58:53.911 --> 58:57.884
What am I supposed to do?
She's not gonna listen to me.

58:58.817 --> 59:01.050
Tell her the truth.

59:01.052 --> 59:02.851
The truth?

59:02.853 --> 59:04.589
The truth.

59:35.619 --> 59:37.188
The truth.

1:01:08.913 --> 1:01:10.281
Emilio!

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:22.694
Still got it.

1:01:25.663 --> 1:01:27.799
- Let's go.
- No! No!

1:01:35.773 --> 1:01:37.109
<i>¡La pistola!</i>

1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:05.168
How are you
standing?

1:02:05.170 --> 1:02:07.237
Adrenaline's
a hell of a drug, son.

1:02:07.239 --> 1:02:08.904
Now, don't worry
about my legs.

1:02:08.906 --> 1:02:11.574
Worry about how we get
the fuck out of here.

1:02:11.576 --> 1:02:13.976
They got shooters
at both doors.

1:02:16.147 --> 1:02:17.648
The A/C.

1:02:17.650 --> 1:02:19.882
You know we can't fit
through that hole.

1:02:19.884 --> 1:02:21.284
She could.

1:02:21.286 --> 1:02:24.387
Hell, no. Berta can shoot.
You can't. I need her.

1:02:24.389 --> 1:02:27.426
It's the only way
she's gonna make it.

1:02:30.161 --> 1:02:31.761
Get out of here.

1:02:31.763 --> 1:02:33.195
I'll hold the door.

1:02:33.197 --> 1:02:35.732
Go, then. Come on.
Go, son, go.

1:02:35.734 --> 1:02:37.203
Go ahead.

1:02:40.404 --> 1:02:42.538
You want in here?

1:02:42.540 --> 1:02:45.276
Well, this is BJ Henry's house,
motherfucker!

1:03:17.576 --> 1:03:18.610
No!

1:03:37.895 --> 1:03:40.431
No!

1:04:00.652 --> 1:04:04.656
I'm BJ Henry,
and my dick is legendary!

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:50.628
Twenty-four hours?

1:05:51.663 --> 1:05:52.864
Damn.

1:05:53.998 --> 1:05:55.533
That's my mistake.

1:05:56.701 --> 1:05:59.268
We all owed at least...

1:05:59.270 --> 1:06:00.873
at least one mistake.

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:03.409
Right, John?

1:06:36.940 --> 1:06:38.643
Why?

1:06:47.518 --> 1:06:48.920
Respect.

1:07:12.310 --> 1:07:14.009
What?

1:07:14.011 --> 1:07:16.179
I told you
not to shoot him.

1:07:16.181 --> 1:07:19.418
- But he was...
- He was supposed to see this.

1:07:24.156 --> 1:07:26.792
<i>You know why
I named you John Henry?</i>

1:07:27.793 --> 1:07:29.595
<i>No.</i>

1:08:05.163 --> 1:08:06.665
What are you doing here?

1:08:08.266 --> 1:08:10.967
I... I came to pick up
the kids like you asked.

1:08:10.969 --> 1:08:15.507
I... I guess I was too late.
What... What happened here?

1:08:19.044 --> 1:08:20.145
Hell.

1:08:21.146 --> 1:08:23.849
- Where...
- He leaves no bodies.

1:08:25.282 --> 1:08:27.218
Then why did he leave you?

1:08:30.487 --> 1:08:32.523
So I'd feel it.

1:08:39.932 --> 1:08:41.965
Okay, we need to get you
to the hospital,

1:08:41.967 --> 1:08:44.433
or you're not gonna be feeling
anything pretty soon.

1:08:44.435 --> 1:08:46.571
Don't worry about me.

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:50.642
There's something
I gotta do.

1:08:51.709 --> 1:08:53.676
Something fucking stupid,
I bet.

1:08:53.678 --> 1:08:57.747
All that talk in school about how
you're not about this life, and now...

1:08:57.749 --> 1:08:59.651
now look at you.

1:09:02.754 --> 1:09:04.119
You should go.

1:09:04.121 --> 1:09:06.922
Yeah, and you should go
to the hospital.

1:09:06.924 --> 1:09:09.962
So I guess we both
ain't doing what we should.

1:09:52.337 --> 1:09:54.071
Here you go.

1:09:54.972 --> 1:09:56.941
Do you still
like it sweet?

1:09:58.610 --> 1:10:01.847
- Sweet's just fine, Gram.
- Yeah.

1:10:07.017 --> 1:10:10.788
It's my birthday today.
Did you know that?

1:10:12.156 --> 1:10:15.259
I wouldn't remember if it
wasn't printed on my ID.

1:10:16.393 --> 1:10:18.193
I never liked birthdays.

1:10:18.195 --> 1:10:21.230
Always felt
if you know your age,

1:10:21.232 --> 1:10:23.498
you live that age.

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.771
Want to know
how old I am today?

1:10:27.304 --> 1:10:28.807
Eighty-two.

1:10:31.743 --> 1:10:35.713
Eighty-two years old.

1:10:41.852 --> 1:10:45.621
Still smoking cigarettes
and waiting to die.

1:10:53.197 --> 1:10:55.898
They say these things
will kill you,

1:10:55.900 --> 1:10:59.502
but they sure is taking
their sweet-ass time with me.

1:11:02.339 --> 1:11:04.506
Where is he?

1:11:04.508 --> 1:11:08.813
Yeah, Helen's daddy was the
first of my sons to pass.

1:11:10.548 --> 1:11:12.384
Your daddy was the last.

1:11:13.918 --> 1:11:16.922
Good thing you never had any
children, John Henry.

1:11:17.923 --> 1:11:21.623
You never got the chance
to outlive 'em.

1:11:21.625 --> 1:11:22.994
Hmm.

1:11:24.396 --> 1:11:25.664
Gram.

1:11:26.565 --> 1:11:28.100
Where is he?

1:11:28.999 --> 1:11:31.002
You know
I can't tell you that.

1:11:33.137 --> 1:11:36.137
- He...
- I knowed what he done.

1:11:36.139 --> 1:11:38.674
I know everything
that boy's done

1:11:38.676 --> 1:11:41.176
since the first time he
walked through my front door

1:11:41.178 --> 1:11:43.682
looking for a roof
to sleep under.

1:11:46.418 --> 1:11:50.656
My mama said even the darkest
soul can still see the light.

1:11:53.124 --> 1:11:54.993
I tried.

1:11:59.931 --> 1:12:02.299
It's my birthday today.

1:12:04.735 --> 1:12:06.672
It's all right, Gram.

1:12:07.204 --> 1:12:08.439
It's all right.

1:12:11.075 --> 1:12:13.411
Eighty-two years old...

1:12:14.645 --> 1:12:17.982
and all I ever seen
was violence.

1:12:19.918 --> 1:12:22.685
It ain't ever
gonna stop, is it?

1:12:22.687 --> 1:12:24.923
It ain't never
gonna stop.

1:12:36.133 --> 1:12:38.900
Thanks for the tea, Gram.

1:12:38.902 --> 1:12:42.940
Don't go, John Henry. You're not like him.
You don't have to do this.

1:12:46.777 --> 1:12:48.813
You really believe that?

1:12:56.954 --> 1:13:00.725
Second drawer,
left of the sink.

1:13:04.661 --> 1:13:08.564
He still gets his mail forwarded
from them houses he run.

1:13:08.566 --> 1:13:10.233
Bills and such.

1:13:10.235 --> 1:13:13.437
As he don't trust the
people working for him.

1:13:14.871 --> 1:13:18.909
I think he just don't want nobody
to see his name on them envelopes.

1:13:20.076 --> 1:13:23.378
If you see the gas bill,
could you carry it to him?

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:24.915
It's past due.

1:13:31.255 --> 1:13:32.891
John Henry.

1:13:34.124 --> 1:13:36.994
Nearly split
his mama in two.

Goddamn, you big.

1:14:07.491 --> 1:14:10.792
Hey, hold up.
I got some questions.

1:14:10.794 --> 1:14:12.961
Like, how'd you get
so fucking big?

1:14:12.963 --> 1:14:15.363
Protein shakes?
Red meat?

1:14:15.365 --> 1:14:17.533
Man, I'm trying to
get big like you.

1:14:17.535 --> 1:14:21.439
My mom say I'm in for a growth spurt,
but she been saying that for three years.

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:25.707
You don't talk much, huh?

1:14:25.709 --> 1:14:29.979
That's how my Uncle Kenny is, at least
till you get a bit of Henny in him.

1:14:29.981 --> 1:14:32.948
So what you doing on this block?
You with Hell?

1:14:32.950 --> 1:14:34.850
You gotta be
if you're on this block.

1:14:34.852 --> 1:14:36.554
I ain't with Hell.

1:14:38.422 --> 1:14:41.056
Then what you doing over here
with that big-ass hammer?

1:14:41.058 --> 1:14:42.860
You gonna get murked,
my guy.

1:14:44.329 --> 1:14:47.299
- What's your name?
- Deydey.

1:14:48.865 --> 1:14:51.936
My name is John Henry.

1:14:58.209 --> 1:15:02.510
Fuck that vape shit, nigga. This job
would be so much better if we could smoke.

1:15:02.512 --> 1:15:04.579
Real talk, my nigga.

1:15:04.581 --> 1:15:07.882
I want to smoke bad as a motherfucker
too, but you know the rules.

1:15:07.884 --> 1:15:09.620
No smoking on the job.

1:15:11.387 --> 1:15:14.457
Orwellian-ass rule,
if you ask me.

1:15:14.459 --> 1:15:17.525
Shit. I, for one,
work better when I'm high.

1:15:17.527 --> 1:15:20.430
All right, "I, for one,"
go ahead and smoke yours.

1:15:20.432 --> 1:15:23.198
Hell find out you been chiefing
that monkey fur on the job,

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:25.000
he gonna burn your ass.
Watch.

1:15:25.002 --> 1:15:27.336
You gonna snitch?
You gonna tell?

1:15:27.338 --> 1:15:30.872
- Fuck you, nigga.
- "If Hell find out," man.

1:15:30.874 --> 1:15:33.376
I fucking...

1:15:33.378 --> 1:15:36.878
use this motherfucking car
lighter so goddamn fast, nigga.

1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:39.014
All right, nigga.
Whatever.

1:15:39.016 --> 1:15:40.986
Light it up, light it up.

1:15:45.789 --> 1:15:47.926
Front,
middle or back?

1:15:50.194 --> 1:15:52.461
What the fuck
you talking about now? What?

1:15:52.463 --> 1:15:55.430
Like <i>Human Centipede,</i> nigga.
If you was in a human centipede,

1:15:55.432 --> 1:15:57.934
where would you rather be, nigga...
the front, the middle or the back?

1:15:57.936 --> 1:16:00.936
Freak-ass nigga.
I told you to stop sex-playing me, man.

1:16:00.938 --> 1:16:02.673
I ain't with that shit!

1:16:04.174 --> 1:16:06.542
How am I sex-playing you?
I just ask you, like...

1:16:06.544 --> 1:16:09.177
- You ain't never seen <i>The Human Centipede?</i>
- What? Uh, what?

1:16:09.179 --> 1:16:12.415
<i>The Human Centipede,</i> nigga.
This German scientist,

1:16:12.417 --> 1:16:15.818
the nigga sewed together three
motherfuckers, ass to mouth.

1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:17.452
It's on Netflix.

1:16:17.454 --> 1:16:19.421
What the fuck
he do that for?

1:16:19.423 --> 1:16:22.125
I don't know. White people be
doing all kind of wild shit.

1:16:22.127 --> 1:16:23.824
Your ass go to jail
too much.

1:16:23.826 --> 1:16:26.662
See, you keep contributing
to that recidivism rate, man.

1:16:26.664 --> 1:16:29.364
Stay your ass out of jail.
Quit looking for that boy pussy.

1:16:29.366 --> 1:16:31.067
There's plenty of women
out here for you, man.

1:16:31.069 --> 1:16:32.801
I'm not looking for
any boy pussy, nigga.

1:16:32.803 --> 1:16:35.836
I'm trying to put you up on game,
nigga, and letting you know,

1:16:35.838 --> 1:16:38.306
like, what they doing out
there in fucking Germany.

1:16:38.308 --> 1:16:40.909
Man, I don't want to know
about fucking Germany

1:16:40.911 --> 1:16:42.677
or no fucking centipedes

1:16:42.679 --> 1:16:45.448
or no goddamn salamanders
or nothing, man.

1:16:45.450 --> 1:16:48.917
I just want this fucking bread.
Corey, what's wrong with you, man?

1:16:48.919 --> 1:16:52.287
- Just making conversation.
- What kind of conversation is that, though?

1:16:52.289 --> 1:16:56.324
I don't know, nigga. You the one up here
using words like "recidivism" and shit.

1:16:56.326 --> 1:16:58.193
What does that mean?

1:16:58.195 --> 1:17:01.730
That mean when niggas
go to jail,

1:17:01.732 --> 1:17:05.835
and-and they keep going back,
to go to jail, nigga.

1:17:05.837 --> 1:17:07.571
I know what the fuck
I'm talk...

1:17:09.139 --> 1:17:10.741
What the fuck?

1:17:13.744 --> 1:17:18.282
<i>♪ He went to the mountain
Early in the morning ♪</i>

1:17:21.819 --> 1:17:23.086
<i>♪ Just to hear ♪</i>

1:17:23.088 --> 1:17:25.587
You picked the wrong day
to go 5150, bro.

1:17:30.995 --> 1:17:34.063
So this the scary
room where y'all kill niggas?

1:17:34.065 --> 1:17:36.301
So who we waiting on?

1:17:41.004 --> 1:17:42.872
Yo, Hell.
What's up with your man?

1:17:42.874 --> 1:17:45.043
Y'all fucking
with me, right?

1:17:52.750 --> 1:17:54.082
Shit.

1:17:54.084 --> 1:17:57.021
- How the fuck...
- It's what I do, bitch.

1:17:59.790 --> 1:18:02.558
Yo, it ain't gotta go
this way. Please.

1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:05.226
I'm ride or die with you, Hell.
This all I got.

1:18:05.228 --> 1:18:07.462
Bitch, the ride is over.

1:18:07.464 --> 1:18:10.099
This about that big nigga?

1:18:10.101 --> 1:18:11.565
That what this is about?

1:18:11.567 --> 1:18:14.271
Yo, I was just trying
to help you.

1:18:59.682 --> 1:19:00.851
Kill him.

1:19:02.186 --> 1:19:03.855
Kill him?

1:19:04.989 --> 1:19:07.155
You want me to kill him
for you?

1:19:07.157 --> 1:19:09.925
Five minutes ago, you was gonna
kill me for some nothing-ass shit.

1:19:09.927 --> 1:19:12.827
Now you expect me to do what you say?
Fuck outta here.

1:19:12.829 --> 1:19:15.432
You fucking
with the wrong one today.

1:19:22.807 --> 1:19:24.509
Really?

1:19:41.090 --> 1:19:43.227
So what you gonna do?

1:20:45.655 --> 1:20:48.422
Come on, man! Don't do this!

1:20:48.424 --> 1:20:50.725
Yo, I don't even know
this nigga!

1:20:56.834 --> 1:20:58.803
Ah, shit!

1:21:01.105 --> 1:21:02.406
No!

1:21:52.990 --> 1:21:55.560
<i>You know why
I named you John Henry?</i>

1:22:29.294 --> 1:22:31.696
Motherfucker's
beating that car up!

1:22:38.402 --> 1:22:39.936
Damn.

1:22:41.137 --> 1:22:43.940
BJ sure did love that car.

1:22:46.343 --> 1:22:48.342
Keep my father's name
out your mouth.

1:22:48.344 --> 1:22:51.012
Ooh.

1:22:51.014 --> 1:22:53.014
So aggressive, John.

1:22:53.016 --> 1:22:57.284
Always knew you had it in you.

1:22:57.286 --> 1:22:59.990
Then you should know
I'm not done.

1:23:01.225 --> 1:23:04.725
You know, you could tear
my empire down brick by brick.

1:23:04.727 --> 1:23:09.866
Doesn't change the fact that we got the
same blood coursing through our veins.

1:23:11.602 --> 1:23:13.538
Nigga, we family.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.909
Not anymore.

1:23:35.092 --> 1:23:36.594
Is that a threat?

1:23:42.532 --> 1:23:44.401
A prediction.

1:23:50.072 --> 1:23:51.609
You ready?

1:24:25.374 --> 1:24:27.110
Lay down, John.

1:24:33.551 --> 1:24:36.152
You know, I don't use
a gun either.

1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:40.221
But not 'cause of no PTSD shit
or nothing like that.

1:24:40.223 --> 1:24:41.924
Nah.

1:24:41.926 --> 1:24:44.795
I don't use a gun
because I don't have to.

1:24:51.869 --> 1:24:55.036
It ain't enough to just
kill niggas anymore.

1:24:55.038 --> 1:24:56.738
Nah.

1:24:56.740 --> 1:24:59.177
Now you've got to kill
what they believe in.

1:25:29.138 --> 1:25:31.074
This is Oscar?

1:25:33.843 --> 1:25:36.211
You know, you asked me
once before,

1:25:36.213 --> 1:25:38.049
"When does it end?"

1:25:40.317 --> 1:25:41.953
Truth is...

1:25:43.152 --> 1:25:44.955
it never ends.

1:25:49.292 --> 1:25:51.228
Heavy lies the crown.

1:25:52.795 --> 1:25:54.699
Watch how I keep it.

1:26:21.859 --> 1:26:23.824
Deydey, what the fuck
you think you doing?

1:26:23.826 --> 1:26:25.762
Get your ass over here!

1:27:01.632 --> 1:27:03.601
Savage, shoot him!

1:27:04.668 --> 1:27:06.036
Nah.

1:27:07.905 --> 1:27:10.003
John, I know you.
Don't do this.

1:27:10.005 --> 1:27:12.306
We family, John!
I know you!

1:27:12.308 --> 1:27:14.074
You ain't no killer!

1:27:14.076 --> 1:27:15.777
You know
you ain't no killer!

1:27:15.779 --> 1:27:18.278
I'm not a killer.

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:19.749
I'm John Henry.

1:27:34.699 --> 1:27:36.631
<i>I said...</i>

1:27:36.633 --> 1:27:39.236

with all that strength, John?</i>
