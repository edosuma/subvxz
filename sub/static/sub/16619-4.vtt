WEBVTT

00:00.695 --> 00:03.531
- Previously on "Quantico"...
- Why is there interference?

00:03.556 --> 00:04.914
There's already a bug in there.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.669
I hope you don't mind, but I sleep naked.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.476
Hope you don't mind. I pray.

00:08.501 --> 00:10.256
It was a blessing you got benched.

00:10.281 --> 00:12.141
That someone probably leaked your name

00:12.144 --> 00:14.542
to make sure you never screwed up again.

00:14.545 --> 00:17.079
I'm in. Tell me what I do next.

00:17.082 --> 00:19.081
"We are the Citizen's Liberation Front.

00:19.084 --> 00:21.349
We've taken control
of a five-block radius

00:21.352 --> 00:22.417
in lower Manhattan."

00:22.420 --> 00:24.652
Six months ago,
after you shut down the op,

00:24.655 --> 00:26.521
- I wrote a report.
- This is your president.

00:26.524 --> 00:28.757
I'm ordering a full pardon of Eric Boyer.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.091
Alex is alive.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:46.210 --> 00:48.174
How you doing? You okay?

00:48.177 --> 00:50.676
Don't talk to me.

00:50.679 --> 00:52.078
You're still mad at me.

00:52.081 --> 00:53.546
Not another sound.

00:53.549 --> 00:55.116
Not another word.

01:03.459 --> 01:06.591
Another hour, another move of hostages.

01:06.594 --> 01:10.129
We shouldn't be wasting our
time hunting one person.

01:10.132 --> 01:12.731
1,700 Federal Hall hostages need food.

01:12.734 --> 01:14.148
Food? Are you kidding me?

01:14.173 --> 01:16.402
We have to cut the dead weight,
or we'll never succeed.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.365
_

01:57.075 --> 01:59.408
Forget everything
you think you know

01:59.411 --> 02:00.776
about these terrorists.

02:00.779 --> 02:02.178
Don't even call them terrorists.

02:02.181 --> 02:04.010
Think of them like actors,

02:04.035 --> 02:07.016
and everything you're seeing
since they took the G20 hostage

02:07.019 --> 02:09.618
over four hours ago is a play.

02:09.621 --> 02:11.953
These are rogue intelligence operatives.

02:11.956 --> 02:13.988
Their tactics and M.O. match a group

02:13.991 --> 02:16.825
that several FBI agents tried
to infiltrate last year.

02:16.828 --> 02:18.793
It is too close to be a coincidence.

02:18.796 --> 02:21.629
And if this is a group
that we called the AIC,

02:21.632 --> 02:23.798
then these people have a goal,

02:23.801 --> 02:25.099
and I don't know what that is yet,

02:25.102 --> 02:26.034
but I do know this...

02:26.037 --> 02:28.936
Everything that they do is a distraction.

02:28.939 --> 02:30.305
They're broadcasting again.

02:33.710 --> 02:36.143
In one hour's time,

02:36.146 --> 02:39.112
the Citizen's Liberation Front

02:39.115 --> 02:44.151
will be prepared to trade 1,667 hostages

02:44.154 --> 02:46.452
in exchange...

02:46.455 --> 02:50.156
for the delivery of
Eric Boyer to their custody.

02:50.159 --> 02:51.858
Why would they want a hacker?

02:51.861 --> 02:52.992
What part in the play is this?

02:52.995 --> 02:55.694
They wanted Boyer the moment
the president pardoned him.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.530
They didn't ask for him
just for him to be pardoned.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.032
This doesn't make sense.

03:00.035 --> 03:01.633
Cooperate,

03:01.636 --> 03:03.869
and this crisis will soon be over.

03:03.872 --> 03:08.740
Resist, and more blood will spill.

03:08.743 --> 03:10.576
What will you choose?

03:12.813 --> 03:14.980
These are my
agents who are in danger.

03:14.983 --> 03:16.848
Look, we can't end this mission

03:16.851 --> 03:19.517
just because you found
this bug in Alex's room.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.887
Yes, it's CIA. No, I can't trace it.

03:22.890 --> 03:24.989
But, for all we know,
it could be Owen Hall

03:24.992 --> 03:26.245
on behalf of a faction.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.492
We're not calling it a
faction anymore, sir.

03:28.495 --> 03:29.994
We call it the AIC.

03:29.997 --> 03:33.931
Owen is most likely
recruiting new AIC members

03:33.934 --> 03:35.599
from your class as we speak,

03:35.602 --> 03:37.488
and this could be his
way of vetting them.

03:37.513 --> 03:40.169
Give me one reason... One reason...

03:40.172 --> 03:43.006
Why I shouldn't just roll
this thing up right now.

03:43.009 --> 03:45.508
Sylvia Erlich.

03:45.511 --> 03:46.776
She was a young operative

03:46.779 --> 03:48.577
working out of the Berlin station.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.846
We suspected that
she was selling secrets

03:50.849 --> 03:52.033
to Russian Intelligence,

03:52.058 --> 03:53.283
so I had people watching her,

03:53.286 --> 03:55.083
gathering facts, building a case,

03:55.086 --> 03:58.220
until last Friday,
when she took her own life.

03:58.223 --> 04:00.289
At least, that's
what we told her family.

04:00.292 --> 04:03.025
Her suicide was staged by professionals

04:03.028 --> 04:05.527
using techniques you're
gonna learn at The Farm.

04:05.530 --> 04:09.764
A CIA operative was murdered by
people inside our own Agency,

04:09.767 --> 04:13.734
people we trained not 10 miles
from where we're standing.

04:13.737 --> 04:16.036
If we don't find these vigilantes

04:16.040 --> 04:19.206
who've infected the Agency
and stop them before long,

04:19.209 --> 04:21.509
they will become the Agency.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.314
Well, we didn't sign up for this

04:26.317 --> 04:28.748
because we thought it would be easy.

04:28.751 --> 04:30.317
What's the countermission?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.385
There is no countermission.

04:32.388 --> 04:33.954
This week, you lay low.

04:33.957 --> 04:37.057
Let this bug thing blow over
while we do some research.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.259
I don't want to lose momentum.

04:39.262 --> 04:40.493
And I don't want to lose my agents,

04:40.496 --> 04:42.662
like you lost yours in Berlin.

04:42.665 --> 04:45.164
You lay low. And no slipups.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.731
One false move at The Farm

04:46.734 --> 04:48.668
could be the difference
between life and death.

04:57.912 --> 04:59.811
Sebastian!

04:59.814 --> 05:00.712
You're still on the phone.

05:00.715 --> 05:02.746
You've been in here half an hour, man.

05:02.749 --> 05:04.048
Sorry, Mommy. Sorry, Daddy.

05:04.051 --> 05:06.351
Harry needs to take a shower now.

05:06.354 --> 05:07.721
Listen. Do you want to
take a shower together

05:07.745 --> 05:09.420
and conserve the water?

05:11.125 --> 05:12.423
Why are you even calling me?

05:12.426 --> 05:14.592
I notified the firm. I'm on leave.

05:14.595 --> 05:16.361
Your witness is
recanting her testimony.

05:16.364 --> 05:18.029
Recanting her testimony?!

05:18.032 --> 05:18.915
She can't do that.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.131
She's Mr. Mbuinga's only alibi
from the night of the attack.

05:21.134 --> 05:23.002
- We have her deposition!
- They claim you falsified...

05:23.026 --> 05:24.182
So, this is what you've
been up all night

05:24.206 --> 05:25.969
- worrying about?
- I could get disbarred!

05:27.974 --> 05:30.540
Falsified?!

05:30.543 --> 05:32.642
Just put me on with the New York office.

05:45.991 --> 05:46.922
Hey.

05:46.925 --> 05:48.991
Alex, I don't think
it's smart if we're...

05:48.994 --> 05:50.659
It'd be more suspicious if we don't.

05:50.662 --> 05:51.994
True.

05:51.997 --> 05:53.158
Well, if we get caught,

05:53.183 --> 05:55.030
just pretend I told a joke or something.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.065
Or you could actually tell me a joke.

05:57.068 --> 06:01.169
Booth, sign for this.

06:05.809 --> 06:07.042
Thank you.

06:11.214 --> 06:12.712
What's that?

06:12.715 --> 06:15.082
Department of Justice. Oh.

06:15.085 --> 06:18.085
See you in class, Parrish.

06:18.088 --> 06:19.219
Okay.

06:29.432 --> 06:32.398
Are the monitors all charged?

06:32.401 --> 06:35.234
They're paired with the system,
and your notes are ready.

06:35.237 --> 06:37.203
We're good to go.

06:37.206 --> 06:39.705
You are never this pleasant
unless there's a reason.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.707
It's called adaptation.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.076
Once I realized I was stuck here,

06:44.079 --> 06:46.578
I figured I should find the bright side.

06:46.581 --> 06:48.947
But if you'd rather fight the whole time,

06:48.950 --> 06:51.716
I'd be happy to oblige.

06:51.719 --> 06:55.853
Let's look at our
Murder Board standings.

06:55.856 --> 06:58.056
Don't feel bad.

06:58.059 --> 06:59.924
Someone's got to be
in last place. Why not you?

06:59.927 --> 07:02.226
Because I was two
spots higher yesterday.

07:02.229 --> 07:03.727
What happened overnight?

07:03.730 --> 07:05.729
At the bottom twice. Shouldn't I be cut?

07:05.732 --> 07:08.132
Ask the man behind the
curtain. It's his call.

07:08.135 --> 07:10.868
But I'd move up fast, or you're out.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.107
All right.

07:16.110 --> 07:19.775
Who can tell me what those are?

07:19.778 --> 07:21.478
- Vital signs?
- No.

07:21.481 --> 07:22.579
They're emotions.

07:22.582 --> 07:24.080
My emotions.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.549
Tension, dread, fear...

07:26.552 --> 07:28.985
These are things that can be measured.

07:28.988 --> 07:31.321
With practice, they
can also be controlled.

07:31.324 --> 07:33.389
A border guard catches you in a lie.

07:33.392 --> 07:35.057
An asset calls your bluff.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.459
A surveillance team shakes your cage.

07:37.462 --> 07:40.095
Being able not just to
conceal signs of stress,

07:40.098 --> 07:41.963
but to avoid feeling them
in the first place...

07:41.966 --> 07:44.166
That is integral to being an operative.

07:44.169 --> 07:46.768
That little piece of
government-engineered plastic

07:46.771 --> 07:49.505
on the desk in front of you
is a window to your soul.

07:49.508 --> 07:51.507
Green, yellow, red.

07:51.510 --> 07:53.174
Your multitude of indicators

07:53.177 --> 07:55.943
boil down to three simple
colors we'll measure today.

07:55.946 --> 07:58.579
The challenge... To stay green

07:58.582 --> 08:00.648
in the most tense of situations.

08:00.651 --> 08:03.584
Just how much do these
little things measure?

08:03.587 --> 08:05.531
Well, they didn't say anything
about late-night wrist movements,

08:05.555 --> 08:06.954
so I think you're in the clear.

08:06.957 --> 08:09.023
I like stress. I feed off it.

08:09.026 --> 08:10.757
Researchers at UC San Diego

08:10.760 --> 08:12.959
invited elite Marines, Olympians, and me

08:12.962 --> 08:14.761
to undergo stress tests in 2011,

08:14.764 --> 08:16.163
and I beat all of them.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.831
Malcolm Gladwell used
me for his latest book.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.100
Okay, now you are stressing me out.

08:21.103 --> 08:23.836
I don't know, man.
This feels like Big Brother to me.

08:23.839 --> 08:25.872
If you're feeling paranoid,
Alex, you should be,

08:25.875 --> 08:27.478
because I am after you.

08:28.610 --> 08:30.209
All of you.

08:30.212 --> 08:32.278
I'm gonna rattle each
and every one of you

08:32.280 --> 08:33.779
and measure the results.

08:33.782 --> 08:35.307
I'm gonna learn your vulnerabilities

08:35.332 --> 08:38.015
and show you how to turn
them into strengths...

08:38.019 --> 08:39.717
'cause, even though we
all have our weaknesses,

08:39.721 --> 08:42.120
it all comes down to fear.

08:42.123 --> 08:45.557
Conquer that, and no one can conquer you.

08:48.062 --> 08:50.495
My turn. I'll watch her.

08:50.498 --> 08:51.529
In Swahili.

08:51.833 --> 08:54.810
_

09:04.534 --> 09:05.510
Alex.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.712
You speak Swahili?

09:08.715 --> 09:09.879
I've just been listening.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.047
I took a chance. Are you okay?

09:11.050 --> 09:12.816
- Yes. I'm okay.
- Okay.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.318
They took Ryan. I don't know where.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.253
I'll find him. I promise.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.554
The terrorists... They haven't killed us.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.256
They threaten to, but don't.

09:20.259 --> 09:20.959
I know.

09:20.984 --> 09:23.058
What about the people
left in Federal Hall?

09:23.061 --> 09:25.528
- Are they still alive?
- Yes.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.263
But the terrorists don't
seem to be interested

09:27.266 --> 09:29.465
in anyone else but you and
the 100 people with you.

09:29.468 --> 09:32.067
112 so far. I've counted.

09:32.070 --> 09:35.237
But all the world leaders from the summit

09:35.240 --> 09:37.071
are in Federal Hall.

09:37.074 --> 09:38.640
They don't want them. Why?

09:38.643 --> 09:39.708
I'm not sure.

09:39.711 --> 09:41.309
Sit down.

09:41.312 --> 09:44.312
All I know is, the hostages
from Federal Hall

09:44.315 --> 09:46.481
are getting too much
for the terrorists to handle,

09:46.484 --> 09:49.083
which is why they want to
trade them all for Boyer.

09:49.086 --> 09:50.452
You can't let that happen, Raina.

09:50.455 --> 09:53.153
But that's almost 1,700 hostages.

09:53.156 --> 09:55.922
- You don't want them rescued?
- Of course I do.

09:55.925 --> 09:57.291
But whatever they want Boyer for

09:57.294 --> 09:58.945
has got to be much worse, right?

09:58.970 --> 10:02.996
These 1,700 people are their
weakness, their stress point.

10:02.999 --> 10:05.299
The longer we can force
them to hold onto them,

10:05.302 --> 10:06.300
the weaker they get,

10:06.303 --> 10:08.268
and the better our chances
are at stopping them.

10:08.271 --> 10:10.936
Eric Boyer can't get inside.

10:11.164 --> 10:15.332
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

10:17.623 --> 10:19.188
Why are they speaking Swahili?

10:19.191 --> 10:20.355
I think they're using it

10:20.380 --> 10:22.358
to hide that they come
from different places.

10:22.361 --> 10:23.402
I think so, too.

10:23.427 --> 10:25.494
Why do they keep moving you around?

10:25.497 --> 10:27.963
Because they're hiding among us.

10:27.966 --> 10:30.164
Like a game of three-card Monte.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.633
This is how Ryan calls it.

10:31.636 --> 10:34.235
They're confusing us so
they can swap in and out

10:34.238 --> 10:35.570
without us noticing it.

10:35.573 --> 10:37.672
I couldn't even tell you
how many they are.

10:37.675 --> 10:41.675
I counted 23 on the floor. Killed 2.

10:41.678 --> 10:44.512
Half of them could be posing as hostages.

10:44.515 --> 10:48.248
That is why this trade
can't happen, Raina.

10:48.251 --> 10:49.717
This is just posturing.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.051
They're begging the FBI

10:51.054 --> 10:52.520
to take these hostages off their hands

10:52.523 --> 10:53.921
because they're dead weight.

10:53.924 --> 10:55.422
They're slowing them down.

10:55.425 --> 10:57.024
Look at these terrorists.

10:57.027 --> 10:58.758
Look at their planning.
Look at their preparation.

10:58.761 --> 10:59.759
Look at their skills.

10:59.762 --> 11:02.361
Whatever they want,
we can't give it to them.

11:02.364 --> 11:04.397
What can I do?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.399
Get them to include you in the trade,

11:06.402 --> 11:09.402
to speak for them so they
don't get voiceprinted.

11:09.405 --> 11:11.070
Then give the FBI an abort code,

11:11.073 --> 11:13.006
something only Miranda would understand.

11:13.009 --> 11:17.042
Um... tell her it's like the
boiler room down here.

11:17.045 --> 11:18.677
- You remember?
- Yes.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.346
Where she found Liam's decoy
bomb after Grand Central.

11:21.349 --> 11:23.415
A fake threat luring us into real danger.

11:23.418 --> 11:24.783
Exactly.

11:24.786 --> 11:27.719
But, without Ryan, I'm scared.

11:27.722 --> 11:28.887
Find Lydia Hall.

11:28.890 --> 11:31.356
We don't get along, but she's
very good at what she does.

11:31.359 --> 11:32.957
She'll get you through this, okay?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.892
- Okay.
- You got this.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.362
Alex!

11:42.069 --> 11:43.534
Of course we make the trade.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.135
Why is this even up for debate?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.336
Trades require trust.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.472
They threw theirs away when
they murdered the First Lady

11:48.475 --> 11:49.557
on national television.

11:49.582 --> 11:52.442
They upped the ante with 1,667 hostages.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.944
I think they earned a second chance.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.713
And you think the AIC will
actually go through with it?

11:56.716 --> 11:59.583
Agent Wyatt, you studied these
people. What do you think?

11:59.586 --> 12:02.385
I think they have been steps ahead of us

12:02.388 --> 12:03.486
since this crisis began,

12:03.489 --> 12:05.088
and if you think this trade

12:05.091 --> 12:06.622
doesn't play into their end game,

12:06.625 --> 12:08.290
then you are not paying attention.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.726
Make the trade. Decrease their leverage.

12:10.729 --> 12:11.894
That's the play.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.462
This hostage exchange

12:13.465 --> 12:16.431
gets us eyes inside the
perimeter for the first time.

12:16.434 --> 12:18.266
And if we find out they're lying,

12:18.269 --> 12:19.401
then we're that much closer

12:19.404 --> 12:21.605
to knowing who we're dealing with.

12:25.442 --> 12:27.075
Paul...

12:27.078 --> 12:28.176
I'm right.

12:31.448 --> 12:34.582
Get the mobile command center rolling.

12:34.585 --> 12:36.584
What about Boyer? Do we have eyes on him?

12:36.587 --> 12:38.419
Since the second he was pardoned.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.954
He arrived at LaGuardia an hour ago.

12:40.957 --> 12:43.189
Now he's in Queens looking at apartments.

12:43.192 --> 12:44.658
It's like he knew this was gonna happen.

12:44.661 --> 12:45.592
He's a free man.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.460
How are you gonna get
him to turn himself in

12:47.463 --> 12:49.162
to a group of terrorists?

12:49.165 --> 12:51.081
Let's find out.

12:54.604 --> 12:56.436
Controlling stress reactions

12:56.439 --> 12:58.370
starts with establishing your base line.

12:58.373 --> 13:00.773
Now, this is you at
your stress-free best.

13:00.776 --> 13:02.541
If you want to make him crack,

13:02.544 --> 13:04.510
ask him about all those
secret phone calls

13:04.513 --> 13:05.812
he makes from the pisser.

13:10.218 --> 13:12.518
Then we throw some common
stressors into the mix

13:12.521 --> 13:14.452
to see how far they move the needle.

13:14.455 --> 13:17.488
Did you see me up there?
Cool as a cucumber.

13:17.491 --> 13:19.557
Oh, so, I guess there's
nothing on your mind.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.260
Not even that special delivery?

13:24.666 --> 13:27.465
You do you, I'll do me.

13:27.468 --> 13:30.368
Underreacting is just
as bad as overreacting.

13:30.371 --> 13:33.037
The key, as always, is balance.

13:36.242 --> 13:39.576
Your heart rate will go down
if you actually breathe.

13:39.579 --> 13:42.345
I'm being subpoenaed for a
mistake I know I didn't make.

13:42.348 --> 13:43.681
Well, nothing you can do about it here.

13:43.684 --> 13:45.849
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.853
Why is the infirmary needing
me for another blood test?

13:50.856 --> 13:52.488
I mean, what are they looking for?

13:52.513 --> 13:54.479
Is it hepatitis? Syphilis?

13:54.482 --> 13:56.592
Look, can I just go to my own doctor?

13:56.595 --> 13:58.394
I've got a really good doctor.
He's very cool.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.997
Our infirmary, tomorrow.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.566
That's all you need to know.

14:07.172 --> 14:08.837
Hang on.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.774
There was in incident at
Cefereso... an escape.

14:12.777 --> 14:14.743
Anaya?

14:14.746 --> 14:16.044
I'm the reason he went to prison.

14:16.047 --> 14:17.212
- If he finds me, he's gonna...
- No.

14:17.215 --> 14:20.348
We got people working with the
Policiá Federal as we speak.

14:20.351 --> 14:22.349
They'll catch him.

14:22.352 --> 14:24.384
Okay. So, we're done with these, right?

14:24.387 --> 14:26.453
Ah. Who said you
could take those off?

14:26.456 --> 14:27.722
Isn't the test over?

14:27.725 --> 14:29.090
The test is never over.

14:29.093 --> 14:30.357
Oh, hang on.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.526
We're not gonna be wearing these
fascist little flibberty-bits

14:32.529 --> 14:34.195
for the next five months, are we?

14:34.198 --> 14:36.597
Nope. Just this afternoon...

14:36.600 --> 14:37.865
at Langley.

14:38.779 --> 14:40.967
Wait. Langley? Does that
mean we can get dressed up?

14:40.970 --> 14:42.602
Because I'm tired of pants.

14:42.605 --> 14:44.871
Well, we want you looking
your best as you rub elbows

14:44.874 --> 14:46.272
with some of the most accomplished

14:46.275 --> 14:49.275
former and current
case officers at the CIA.

14:49.278 --> 14:53.213
They like to meet the new kids,
kick the tires, find the lemons.

14:53.216 --> 14:55.981
And I take their feedback very
seriously, and so should you.

14:56.006 --> 14:58.806
Ruffle the wrong feathers
or fail to impress,

14:58.809 --> 15:00.530
you might find yourself chained to a desk

15:00.555 --> 15:01.612
for the rest of your careers.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.956
Stressful situations, stress monitors.

15:03.959 --> 15:05.724
- I get it.
- You'd better.

15:05.727 --> 15:08.293
If anyone hits red,
they don't even get the desk.

15:08.296 --> 15:09.394
They just go home.

15:09.397 --> 15:12.430
And, hey, I will be watching you.

15:16.103 --> 15:18.636
Ryan, these dishes aren't
gonna wash themselves.

15:21.242 --> 15:22.606
Can we make it quick?

15:22.609 --> 15:24.408
Yeah. I have an idea.

15:24.411 --> 15:26.610
A dangerous one, it looks like.

15:26.613 --> 15:29.147
This is the idea, these monitors.

15:29.150 --> 15:30.847
Look, I know we're supposed
to lay low for a while,

15:30.850 --> 15:33.616
but Owen just gave us a gift,
and he doesn't even know it...

15:33.619 --> 15:35.585
A countermission no one
could have planned for.

15:35.588 --> 15:37.620
I'm listening.

15:47.599 --> 15:49.198
Mr. Boyer.

15:49.201 --> 15:51.600
Miranda Shaw, FBI. Come with me.

15:51.603 --> 15:53.602
Nice try, but I'm a free man now.

15:53.605 --> 15:54.837
You can't touch me.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.772
You're right.

15:56.775 --> 15:58.140
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:58.143 --> 15:59.641
You're under arrest.

15:59.644 --> 16:01.110
For what?!

16:01.113 --> 16:03.279
I got a presidential pardon, remember?

16:03.282 --> 16:05.713
That was before you jaywalked.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.548
What? Are you kidding me?!

16:07.551 --> 16:09.284
Has anyone heard of the Fourth Amendment?

16:09.287 --> 16:10.562
You gonna let her arrest me?

16:10.587 --> 16:12.287
She's my boss, and I like my job.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.521
What do you want from me?

16:13.524 --> 16:17.325
Mr. Boyer, you have the power
to save thousands of lives.

16:17.328 --> 16:19.436
But that's only if you trade yourself in

16:19.461 --> 16:21.528
to the terrorists that
are holding them hostage.

16:21.531 --> 16:23.331
That's gonna be a hard pass.

16:24.634 --> 16:27.601
I think you'll change your
mind once I make my case.

16:29.151 --> 16:30.283
Stay here.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.080
You didn't live up to
your end of the bargain.

16:42.318 --> 16:44.050
You're one of them?

16:44.053 --> 16:47.253
Consider me a representative.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.689
You knew what
you were supposed to do,

16:50.692 --> 16:52.325
and you didn't do it.

16:52.328 --> 16:55.560
And so now I'm going to have
to turn you over to them,

16:55.563 --> 16:59.497
which we both know is
going to be far worse.

16:59.500 --> 17:03.268
If you do, it's suicide.

17:03.271 --> 17:06.704
Not for me.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.509
He agreed.

17:11.512 --> 17:14.678
Babysit him. I'm phoning it in.

17:14.681 --> 17:17.882
Since I might be dead in a couple hours,

17:17.885 --> 17:20.351
I'd like to take this
moment to apologize to you.

17:20.354 --> 17:23.520
For hacking more dangerous,
highly classified Intel

17:23.522 --> 17:25.955
than the Panama Papers
and WikiLeaks combined?

17:25.959 --> 17:28.725
For hacking McGregor-Wyatt in 2012.

17:28.728 --> 17:31.761
Great system. I enjoyed the challenge.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.931
I swear I didn't read any
of your personal messages,

17:34.934 --> 17:37.367
but if I make it into
that building alive,

17:37.370 --> 17:38.601
you might want to.

17:38.604 --> 17:41.005
Let's go.

17:56.632 --> 17:59.599
Nice to see a familiar face.

17:59.602 --> 18:00.833
No, we've never met.

18:00.836 --> 18:02.803
Lydia Hall.

18:04.707 --> 18:07.506
You also know Alex Parrish, don't you?

18:07.509 --> 18:10.441
We've... crossed paths.

18:10.444 --> 18:12.543
So did we. Just 10 minutes ago.

18:12.546 --> 18:15.446
She's here, fighting back against them.

18:15.449 --> 18:17.148
They're preparing for an exchange...

18:17.151 --> 18:20.118
The Federal Hall hostages for Eric Boyer.

18:20.121 --> 18:21.886
Alex wants to sabotage it...

18:21.889 --> 18:24.623
cripple the terrorists
and stop what comes next.

18:24.626 --> 18:25.657
If you want to cripple them,

18:25.660 --> 18:28.325
take away the leverage all
the hostages give them.

18:28.328 --> 18:29.693
That's not what Alex thinks.

18:29.696 --> 18:32.395
She's not a government agent.

18:32.398 --> 18:33.563
I am.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.132
But I know Alex.

18:35.135 --> 18:36.634
I don't know you.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.068
You knew Simon Asher.

18:38.071 --> 18:40.704
You know he and Alex made many mistakes

18:40.707 --> 18:41.974
along the way to saving the day,

18:41.998 --> 18:44.340
including not turning to
the authorities for help.

18:44.343 --> 18:47.176
We need to save as many
people as possible right now

18:47.179 --> 18:49.311
and figure out the rest after.

18:49.314 --> 18:51.848
Clearly, Alex told you
you could trust me.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.617
Trust me.

18:57.523 --> 19:01.757
Remember, I'm gonna be
able to see everything you feel,

19:01.760 --> 19:04.926
so stay in control and
don't go into the red,

19:04.929 --> 19:08.597
no matter who you talk
to or what they say.

19:10.035 --> 19:12.600
I'll see you guys later. Thank you.

19:12.603 --> 19:14.202
Easy scenario for you.

19:14.205 --> 19:15.737
A bunch of desk jockeys

19:15.740 --> 19:17.539
who want to meet the
woman who saved the world.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.073
No stress there.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.440
Good thing we have a countermission

19:20.443 --> 19:21.709
to keep things more interesting.

19:21.712 --> 19:22.643
Check it out.

19:22.646 --> 19:25.680
Next-gen handheld cell tower simulator...

19:25.683 --> 19:27.748
courtesy of our guardian angel.

19:27.751 --> 19:30.617
Well, I'll give him one thing...
The CIA's got cooler toys.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.419
- That they do.
- How's it work?

19:32.422 --> 19:33.554
I get close enough to Owen,

19:33.557 --> 19:36.022
and his phone thinks that
mine's a local cell tower.

19:36.025 --> 19:37.340
It gathers all its data,

19:37.365 --> 19:39.893
and soon enough, we
have his phone cloned.

19:39.896 --> 19:41.771
And everything he's got
on the stress monitor.

19:41.796 --> 19:42.729
Exactly.

19:42.732 --> 19:45.598
I just have to stay close enough
for the cloning to complete.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.302
And you have to make our fellow
recruits very uncomfortable.

19:49.305 --> 19:51.704
Ask them about the AIC
as indirectly as you can.

19:51.707 --> 19:53.638
- I'll record every word.
- Okay.

19:53.641 --> 19:54.823
And, once you get his phone,

19:54.848 --> 19:56.709
we'll see who spikes when I prod them.

19:56.712 --> 19:57.743
Exactly.

19:57.746 --> 19:58.911
Hey.

19:58.914 --> 20:00.212
We're good at this.

20:00.215 --> 20:01.815
You seem surprised.

20:03.284 --> 20:04.416
My father's been chatting up

20:04.419 --> 20:06.730
some very interesting
friends here tonight...

20:06.755 --> 20:08.486
Stoller, Lufkin, Laveriere.

20:08.489 --> 20:10.454
In counterintelligence.

20:10.457 --> 20:12.090
I thought it was odd
he changed the scenario

20:12.093 --> 20:13.557
to bring the class here tonight.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.793
Now you know why. He's digging.

20:15.796 --> 20:18.562
We don't know that he's digging.

20:20.634 --> 20:22.233
Don't be hard on yourself.

20:22.236 --> 20:23.400
Every lawyer makes mistakes.

20:23.403 --> 20:24.602
But I didn't.

20:24.605 --> 20:25.769
I mean, at least I don't think

20:25.772 --> 20:27.437
I would have falsified testimony.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.805
Worst case... You're disbarred.

20:28.808 --> 20:30.907
But you've left the law
behind. Who cares?

20:30.910 --> 20:33.443
Look, if you want to fight this,
the Agency will support you.

20:33.446 --> 20:34.410
I promise.

20:34.413 --> 20:36.646
You may have to ride
a desk until it's over.

20:36.671 --> 20:37.860
But that could take years.

20:37.885 --> 20:39.919
Like I said, we'll support you.

20:40.987 --> 20:43.018
Two years on the Mexico desk.

20:43.021 --> 20:46.188
I've never even met a man who
came out of Cefereso alive.

20:46.191 --> 20:47.790
Did you hear about Anaya?

20:47.793 --> 20:48.791
I did.

20:48.794 --> 20:50.659
The Federales will grab him.

20:50.662 --> 20:51.994
The Federales let him go.

20:51.997 --> 20:54.630
Obviously, he made some sort of deal.

20:54.633 --> 20:57.633
What? Did you hear he escaped?

20:57.636 --> 21:00.135
Who escapes Cefereso?

21:00.138 --> 21:02.336
So, about that next drink...

21:02.339 --> 21:05.339
I'll get it for you. Excuse me.

21:07.711 --> 21:09.844
Bad night.

21:09.847 --> 21:11.804
- And getting worse.
- Don't let it get to you.

21:13.050 --> 21:15.549
Back when I EOD'd, you could be gay.

21:15.552 --> 21:16.884
You just had to keep your head down.

21:16.887 --> 21:19.154
- Mm.
- Now they're recruiting us.

21:21.391 --> 21:23.824
You know, I can think of
someone who's zero feet away.

21:23.827 --> 21:26.526
Huh? Oh, uh, hello.

21:26.529 --> 21:29.396
No, I'm just making a little
timeline for myself...

21:29.399 --> 21:33.700
Who, when, where, and how far did I go.

21:33.703 --> 21:34.901
That's quite a chat history.

21:34.904 --> 21:37.069
You know the Agency covers PrEP now.

21:37.072 --> 21:38.171
Yeah. I know firsthand.

21:38.174 --> 21:42.741
But, just in case I skipped
a dose, I'm making a list.

21:45.647 --> 21:48.181
Ooh. You look stressed.

21:48.184 --> 21:50.183
- I just have a lot on my mind.
- Yeah.

21:50.186 --> 21:51.716
Well, I've already charmed
half of Langley

21:51.719 --> 21:53.852
with a career's worth of
cocktail-party chatter,

21:53.855 --> 21:55.486
and I'm still green as a solar farm.

21:55.489 --> 21:57.222
You better keep up, or you'll look bad.

21:57.225 --> 21:59.792
I'll try and remember that.

22:05.834 --> 22:09.099
Hey, Owen. Um...

22:09.102 --> 22:10.267
This hard for you, too?

22:10.270 --> 22:13.770
You know... Your prize recruits
under the microscope.

22:13.773 --> 22:15.739
If we fail, you fail.

22:15.742 --> 22:17.875
You should worry less about
me and more about you.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.744
Bottom of the Murder
Board, poor attitude.

22:20.747 --> 22:22.012
Listen, excuse me.

22:22.015 --> 22:23.881
Hey.

22:25.117 --> 22:29.052
I'm just curious what I can do better.

22:29.055 --> 22:31.020
I...

22:31.023 --> 22:32.421
Any pointers?

22:34.426 --> 22:35.624
I see what you're doing.

22:35.627 --> 22:37.894
You do?

22:37.897 --> 22:39.929
You're hanging around me, no spikes.

22:39.932 --> 22:41.864
I'm your teacher, you
know me, I'm harmless,

22:41.867 --> 22:45.033
and you're good with teachers,
aren't you, Alex?

22:45.036 --> 22:46.902
But I don't play on
that side of the pool.

22:46.905 --> 22:48.070
Not with my recruits.

22:48.073 --> 22:52.008
And if you don't start doing better,
next cut, you're out.

23:32.981 --> 23:37.116
For every 10 hostages you release,

23:37.119 --> 23:40.286
we'll take one foot forward with Boyer.

23:40.289 --> 23:42.654
When all the hostages have been freed,

23:42.657 --> 23:46.293
we'll fall back and leave
Boyer in your custody.

23:50.131 --> 23:51.529
Come on, Raina.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.867
Don't do it, Raina.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.405
Let's begin.

24:06.647 --> 24:08.546
This way! Come on, people. This way.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.883
So far, so good.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.186
Let's go. This way.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.787
- Right through here.
- Release the next 10,

24:17.790 --> 24:20.791
and we will take a step forward.

24:31.256 --> 24:33.332
We're at 1,250.

24:33.357 --> 24:35.925
We will take a step forward.

24:40.699 --> 24:42.230
1,260.

24:42.233 --> 24:43.364
Come on, come on.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.802
Taking a step forward.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.105
You can do this.

24:51.108 --> 24:52.941
Now's the time, Raina. Come on.

24:56.914 --> 24:57.945
1,270.

24:57.948 --> 25:00.448
Stepping forward.

25:01.885 --> 25:03.684
Oh, come on.

25:03.687 --> 25:05.885
It's hot...

25:05.888 --> 25:08.088
like a boiler room.

25:08.091 --> 25:10.056
What?

25:10.059 --> 25:13.293
The boiler room. Remember?

25:15.364 --> 25:17.463
I'm sorry, Raina.

25:17.466 --> 25:19.298
I don't understand.

25:19.301 --> 25:21.400
You have Boyer now.

25:21.403 --> 25:23.669
Give us the rest of the hostages.

25:23.953 --> 25:25.586
_

25:47.995 --> 25:49.894
I didn't know you'd be here.

25:49.897 --> 25:53.264
Oh, I had to see a
genuine Owen Hall scenario

25:53.267 --> 25:55.299
on its feet with my own eyes.

25:55.302 --> 25:57.000
You do good work. Always have.

25:57.003 --> 25:59.602
So good you're here to
offer me a field assignment?

25:59.605 --> 26:02.906
Even I can't fix what happened.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.174
Depends on what really happened.

26:04.177 --> 26:06.309
A journalist revealed your name.

26:06.312 --> 26:08.912
It's a matter of public record,
not a conspiracy.

26:08.915 --> 26:10.680
Public record's always conspiracy.

26:10.683 --> 26:14.316
But nothing to be done about it now.

26:14.319 --> 26:15.985
At least the Agency has me housebound.

26:15.988 --> 26:18.087
It's a living, breathing warning

26:18.090 --> 26:20.289
to never trust the people closest to us.

26:20.292 --> 26:22.124
Especially journalists.

26:22.127 --> 26:23.693
Them, too.

26:27.032 --> 26:30.364
Spending more time with your
cellphone than our hosts.

26:30.367 --> 26:32.133
Not what I expected from you.

26:32.136 --> 26:34.202
I'm just bored.

26:34.205 --> 26:35.170
Bored?

26:35.173 --> 26:36.337
Or distracted?

26:36.340 --> 26:37.972
That little envelope

26:37.975 --> 26:40.608
you got from the estate of Liam O'Connor?

26:40.611 --> 26:44.879
Every piece of mail that comes
into The Farm is subject to...

26:44.882 --> 26:46.814
Do I really need to finish?

26:46.817 --> 26:48.315
It's just a key to a P.O. box.

26:48.318 --> 26:50.684
- Where?
- A couple miles away.

26:50.687 --> 26:52.619
The world's most infamous terrorist.

26:52.622 --> 26:55.355
Wonder what he left you.

26:55.358 --> 26:57.091
As if all the drama weren't enough.

26:59.495 --> 27:02.163
If you need someone to go with you...

27:08.137 --> 27:09.468
Hey.

27:09.471 --> 27:11.137
I'm not getting anywhere with Owen.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.972
You have to take over.

27:12.975 --> 27:14.841
You'll figure it out. It was your idea.

27:14.844 --> 27:17.076
You can't leave. We're supposed
to be working this together.

27:17.079 --> 27:19.045
I did what you asked. I prodded everyone.

27:19.048 --> 27:22.047
- I'm done here.
- What is going on with you today?

27:22.050 --> 27:24.883
I'll see you back at The Farm.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.389
My parents didn't do it.
The hospital didn't. I...

27:31.392 --> 27:32.858
Is this how you're gonna pass the test?

27:34.062 --> 27:36.261
- By skipping it?
- Yep.

27:36.264 --> 27:38.195
None of them is gonna have
anything good to say about you.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.164
And they're not gonna have
anything bad to say either.

27:40.167 --> 27:41.698
Oh, you're gonna be a blast in the field.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.534
"Bartender, one chocolate milk,
shaken, not stirred."

27:44.537 --> 27:45.836
Why are you bothering me?

27:45.839 --> 27:47.338
Because you're wasting your chance.

27:47.341 --> 27:50.841
And what's the point in living
if you're not gonna live?

27:50.844 --> 27:54.211
You might as well do everyone
a favor and kill yourself now.

27:56.182 --> 27:57.780
I usually pray for men like you.

27:57.783 --> 27:59.883
I do.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.886
But in your case, why bother?

28:07.093 --> 28:08.958
You don't like me? That's fine.

28:08.961 --> 28:11.294
You want to shame me?
You can keep trying.

28:11.297 --> 28:13.295
But I deserve an explanation.

28:13.298 --> 28:14.963
I don't make it a habit to explain anything

28:14.966 --> 28:17.299
to recruits who won't
be here very long.

28:19.971 --> 28:22.938
As far as I can tell, the Hall family

28:22.941 --> 28:24.940
is my only obstacle that I'm up against.

28:24.943 --> 28:26.942
First, it was your
daughter. Now it's you.

28:26.945 --> 28:29.277
For the record, this isn't my first round

28:29.280 --> 28:31.078
with a teacher who's had it out for me.

28:31.081 --> 28:32.713
At least, last time, I knew why.

28:32.716 --> 28:35.917
Tell me, Alex... Are you still
haunted by what he did?

28:35.920 --> 28:37.952
For how he used you?

28:37.955 --> 28:41.255
The mistakes, the doubt...
That's why you're here.

28:41.258 --> 28:44.125
You ran from it. Ran all
the way to the CIA.

28:44.128 --> 28:47.093
The choices you made saved lives.

28:47.096 --> 28:48.094
The fact that you could make them,

28:48.097 --> 28:49.830
stick your neck out when
no one else would...

28:49.854 --> 28:51.271
That's your greatest strength.

28:51.274 --> 28:55.335
That's also the source of your
greatest weakness... doubt.

28:55.338 --> 28:56.569
The doubt that you did the right thing,

28:56.572 --> 28:58.004
the doubt that you could have done more,

28:58.007 --> 29:01.341
the doubt over if your
friends really had to die.

29:01.344 --> 29:05.811
As long as you let that doubt
run wild, it will own you.

29:05.814 --> 29:09.114
That's what this scenario is all about.

29:09.117 --> 29:10.782
It didn't start when you put these on.

29:10.785 --> 29:12.217
It's been all week.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.853
You were testing us.

29:14.878 --> 29:17.136
Last on the Murder Board for no reason.

29:17.139 --> 29:19.024
Not just you. Everyone.

29:19.027 --> 29:20.959
We've been manipulating you all week.

29:20.962 --> 29:23.027
Even people here are in on it.

29:23.030 --> 29:24.362
To see how we handle it.

29:24.365 --> 29:25.396
Good for you.

29:25.399 --> 29:27.498
You figured it out,
but just a little too late,

29:27.501 --> 29:28.799
like usual.

29:28.802 --> 29:33.339
You're always this close to measuring up.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.385
Shots fired! Shots fired!

29:48.388 --> 29:52.189
- Down!
- Move, move, move!

29:56.395 --> 29:58.861
No, no, no.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.397
Move, move, move!

30:02.767 --> 30:04.001
We've got all the hostages.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.135
Let's go.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.370
All right, move out!

30:07.373 --> 30:09.372
Come on, let's go!

30:17.646 --> 30:20.912
Well, thank God that was all a dream.

30:20.915 --> 30:22.648
You exploited us.

30:22.651 --> 30:25.149
Yes, we did.

30:25.152 --> 30:27.976
When we said we were gonna
shake your cage, we meant it.

30:28.001 --> 30:29.332
We lied...

30:29.335 --> 30:31.234
invented crises that were close to home.

30:31.237 --> 30:33.103
Come on. Gunshots, tough questions...

30:33.106 --> 30:34.605
Anyone can conquer those.

30:34.608 --> 30:38.174
Each of you have one stressor
that can do real damage,

30:38.177 --> 30:41.011
one the enemy will always try
to find to make you crack.

30:41.014 --> 30:43.245
Maybe it's disgrace...

30:43.248 --> 30:44.947
shame...

30:44.950 --> 30:47.049
mortality...

30:47.052 --> 30:48.618
or your past.

30:48.621 --> 30:51.854
Maybe you're easy to manipulate.

30:51.857 --> 30:53.556
Or maybe you're plagued with doubt.

30:53.559 --> 30:57.560
Whatever it is, identify it, accept it.

30:57.563 --> 31:00.028
Your greatest weakness
can't be conquered,

31:00.031 --> 31:03.999
but if you embrace it,
it can't kill you either.

31:37.399 --> 31:40.210
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

31:43.072 --> 31:46.072
The Agency made me think
that I screwed up a case

31:46.075 --> 31:47.474
and I was getting disbarred.

31:47.477 --> 31:48.908
Of course, I didn't.

31:48.911 --> 31:52.110
But they knew how to get me.

31:52.113 --> 31:53.445
I mean, I could have.

31:53.448 --> 31:54.947
I've made mistakes.

31:54.950 --> 31:56.782
We all make mistakes.

31:56.785 --> 31:58.784
No, you don't get it.

31:58.787 --> 32:01.419
Making mistakes is my biggest weakness...

32:01.422 --> 32:02.654
my fear.

32:02.657 --> 32:05.357
And Owen and Lydia know that.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.627
They know things...
not just facts, but feelings.

32:09.630 --> 32:11.529
They know what we're afraid of.

32:11.532 --> 32:15.265
How? What test showed them that?

32:16.470 --> 32:18.703
Well, the CIA made me think

32:18.706 --> 32:22.339
that a very dangerous man
had escaped and was after me.

32:22.342 --> 32:26.342
And they knew that fear of mine, too.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.045
Hey, maybe after we get out of here,

32:29.048 --> 32:30.614
we'll be able to look at people

32:30.617 --> 32:33.349
and find their weaknesses like they do.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.917
What if you don't want that?

32:35.942 --> 32:40.990
Doesn't it seem awful to know
everything about everyone?

32:40.993 --> 32:43.125
To see their pain?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.661
Isn't it worse not to see it?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.205
What did they trick you with?

32:57.208 --> 33:00.474
They asked for my medical records...

33:00.477 --> 33:02.176
Pre-disclosure.

33:02.179 --> 33:04.012
I was 14.

33:04.015 --> 33:07.516
You tried to kill yourself, didn't you?

33:10.588 --> 33:13.988
Yeah, they tried to use
medical records with me, too.

33:13.991 --> 33:19.093
So I guess we're roommates for a reason.

33:21.097 --> 33:23.830
Look, I know you don't care,

33:23.833 --> 33:28.068
but someone close to me
struggled with the same thing.

33:28.071 --> 33:30.270
I mean, he actually did
go through with it

33:30.273 --> 33:34.373
in the messiest way possible,

33:34.376 --> 33:36.208
right in front of me.

33:36.211 --> 33:39.912
And, you know, people ask
what could they have done

33:39.915 --> 33:43.415
to prevent it, but, no, I don't.

33:43.418 --> 33:47.286
All I can think is, "Well,
why wasn't that me?

33:47.289 --> 33:50.088
Why did he feel all that conflict,

33:50.091 --> 33:51.122
all... all that pain?

33:51.125 --> 33:55.226
Why was it so easy for me

33:55.229 --> 33:58.130
and so hard for him?"

34:00.635 --> 34:03.401
I'm not gay.

34:03.404 --> 34:06.236
Yeah.

34:06.239 --> 34:09.206
That's what he said, too.

34:15.581 --> 34:18.281
Yeah.

34:26.125 --> 34:27.824
This is yours, I take it?

34:27.827 --> 34:29.225
Thank you.

34:29.228 --> 34:30.827
These aren't easy to replace.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.261
There's no gift shop...

34:32.264 --> 34:33.897
like at the FBI.

34:36.902 --> 34:38.900
You must be pretty proud of yourself.

34:38.904 --> 34:40.568
Little bit.

34:40.592 --> 34:42.148
My dad and I had a bet.

34:42.172 --> 34:43.219
He thought you would get it

34:43.244 --> 34:45.007
before going to the post office.

34:45.010 --> 34:47.242
I made $5.

34:47.245 --> 34:49.811
- I'm not haunted by O'Connor.
- Yes.

34:49.813 --> 34:52.147
This late-night confrontation
is really doing a lot

34:52.150 --> 34:54.248
to prove your nonchalance
over the matter.

34:56.487 --> 34:59.186
I built a career following orders,

34:59.189 --> 35:01.288
and I almost followed them into tragedy.

35:01.291 --> 35:02.295
If it weren't for Alex,

35:02.320 --> 35:03.758
thousands of people would have died.

35:03.761 --> 35:06.193
Is it hard, working side by side

35:06.196 --> 35:08.295
with the reminder of the
mistakes that you made?

35:08.298 --> 35:10.932
It's probably easier than
working with my father.

35:26.315 --> 35:27.548
Round three?

35:29.218 --> 35:30.816
What you said in class hit me.

35:30.819 --> 35:33.618
- I don't doubt it.
- Cute.

35:33.621 --> 35:35.954
I knew throwing you at the
bottom of the Murder Board

35:35.957 --> 35:37.790
would make you spin out.

35:37.793 --> 35:39.291
Do I belong here?

35:39.294 --> 35:41.526
In your mind?

35:41.529 --> 35:43.729
Simple question, really.

35:43.732 --> 35:46.231
I was the one who recruited you here.

35:46.234 --> 35:50.301
I believe you may be special.

35:50.304 --> 35:53.304
And you keep working as hard as you are,

35:53.307 --> 35:55.006
and we're gonna have a talk.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.488
Very soon.

36:06.419 --> 36:08.119
Yes, we will.

36:10.739 --> 36:12.846
Bring everyone down
to the set that you can.

36:12.849 --> 36:15.114
I need I.D.s and interviews
on all the hostages

36:15.117 --> 36:16.149
before they're released.

36:16.152 --> 36:17.684
Released?

36:17.687 --> 36:20.020
I can't hold nearly 1,700 hostages,

36:20.023 --> 36:21.655
including world leaders.

36:21.658 --> 36:24.290
One of the terrorists could be
hiding with them... or more.

36:24.293 --> 36:25.992
That's why I said "interview."

36:25.995 --> 36:27.661
You told us this trade was a trap.

36:27.664 --> 36:28.694
It wasn't.

36:28.697 --> 36:30.362
There was panic,
but there were no casualties.

36:30.365 --> 36:32.031
And the terrorists are falling apart.

36:32.034 --> 36:33.498
You heard those gunshots.

36:33.501 --> 36:35.968
Almost 2,000 hostages were freed,

36:35.971 --> 36:37.670
including the president
of the United States,

36:37.673 --> 36:39.939
who, obviously, is not
in very good shape.

36:39.942 --> 36:42.541
All it cost us was Eric Boyer.

36:42.544 --> 36:45.177
I respect you, Shelby,
but I'm following Miranda on this.

36:45.180 --> 36:46.879
I'm sorry.

36:56.123 --> 36:57.288
Hey.

36:58.859 --> 37:02.859
So, a doe walks out of
the woods and says,

37:02.862 --> 37:05.195
"That's the last time I
do that for two bucks."

37:05.198 --> 37:08.231
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

37:08.234 --> 37:09.399
Ah, you asked for it.

37:09.402 --> 37:11.468
I didn't ask for it.

37:11.471 --> 37:12.502
And you did it.

37:12.505 --> 37:13.870
We did it.

37:13.873 --> 37:15.038
Or at least I hope so.

37:15.041 --> 37:16.206
You got the audio?

37:16.209 --> 37:18.208
Here you go.

37:18.211 --> 37:20.042
Okay.

37:20.045 --> 37:22.590
All right. Let's see.

37:23.983 --> 37:26.983
There it is.

37:26.986 --> 37:29.251
Look at us.

37:29.254 --> 37:32.588
Finally alone,
and we have nothing to say to each other.

37:32.591 --> 37:37.092
Actually, I have... I have a lot to say.

37:37.095 --> 37:39.327
What?

37:39.330 --> 37:44.232
They didn't correctly
identify my weakness today.

37:44.235 --> 37:46.367
It's not Liam.

37:46.370 --> 37:50.739
And it's not issues with authority.

37:50.742 --> 37:51.940
It's you.

37:51.943 --> 37:54.441
Worrying if you're okay,

37:54.444 --> 37:57.044
worrying if

37:57.047 --> 37:59.513
worrying you're ever really gonna trust me,

37:59.516 --> 38:03.951
or if we're gonna make
it out of this together.

38:03.954 --> 38:07.154
And I-I've been pulling
away from you lately.

38:07.157 --> 38:10.557
I know it's true, but...

38:10.560 --> 38:13.660
I have to.

38:13.663 --> 38:17.130
Alex, if we're...
If we're gonna succeed at this thing,

38:17.133 --> 38:18.965
they can't see how connected I am to you.

38:18.968 --> 38:21.400
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

38:21.403 --> 38:25.071
I have to figure out a way to
go through this thing alone,

38:25.074 --> 38:26.739
even when you're 10 feet away from me.

38:26.742 --> 38:28.507
I get it.

38:30.578 --> 38:32.078
Thank you for telling me that.

38:33.848 --> 38:36.182
Okay. Let's get back to work.

38:41.156 --> 38:43.655
Mm.

38:43.658 --> 38:45.923
Tough day?

38:45.926 --> 38:47.559
Productive.

38:50.630 --> 38:53.799
Did you find what you were
looking for at Langley?

38:55.869 --> 38:59.369
Or I guess we don't talk
about things like that.

38:59.372 --> 39:01.705
What do you think I was looking for?

39:01.708 --> 39:04.174
The same thing I was...

39:04.177 --> 39:06.976
The truth about why you were benched.

39:06.979 --> 39:08.477
You think you got burned on purpose.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.180
You want names.

39:10.183 --> 39:12.281
You talked to Matthew.

39:12.284 --> 39:13.616
He cares about you.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.485
Doesn't want you barking
up any wrong trees.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.121
Thinks injustice is your weakness.

39:19.124 --> 39:23.225
Last week, you told me the
CIA was better off without me.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.226
I was angry.

39:24.229 --> 39:27.462
And I'm beginning to
think they want me to be

39:27.465 --> 39:29.164
so I can do their work for them.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.866
Are you?

39:52.922 --> 39:55.655
I thought you slept naked.

39:55.658 --> 39:58.024
And I thought you prayed.

39:58.027 --> 39:59.926
I haven't seen you do that for weeks.

39:59.929 --> 40:01.194
I do it.

40:01.197 --> 40:02.662
Just when you're not around.

40:02.665 --> 40:07.200
Yeah? Well, I just felt
a little cold, that's all.

40:14.042 --> 40:16.208
All good.

40:16.211 --> 40:17.243
He's dropped it.

40:17.246 --> 40:18.514
Thank you, Lydia.

40:18.539 --> 40:20.679
We'll get you back in the field soon.

40:22.717 --> 40:26.352
Now tell me who you
think did it, and why.

40:28.689 --> 40:31.422
Ryan, come here.

40:31.425 --> 40:32.723
Check out these stress spikes.

40:32.726 --> 40:33.724
They're Leigh's.

40:33.727 --> 40:35.526
Play the audio from when
you were talking to her.

40:35.529 --> 40:37.495
One step ahead of you.

40:37.498 --> 40:41.166
Wonder when they'll teach us
about surveillance around here.

40:41.169 --> 40:43.567
Surveillance? What do you care?

40:43.570 --> 40:44.935
You've never used a bug?

40:44.938 --> 40:46.403
Why would I have ever done that?

40:46.406 --> 40:47.537
Wait. Look at that spike.

40:47.540 --> 40:48.538
All red.

40:48.541 --> 40:52.342
She's been listening
to us this whole time.

41:31.449 --> 41:33.581
Get to it. You promised.

41:33.584 --> 41:35.415
That was before you did all this.

41:35.418 --> 41:38.118
It wasn't supposed to go this far.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.253
That's not up to you.

41:39.256 --> 41:40.420
No.

41:40.423 --> 41:41.853
But this is.

41:53.502 --> 41:55.468
What happened? We heard gunshots.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.904
They're gone. Everyone's safe.

41:57.907 --> 41:59.239
You were right to do what you did.

41:59.242 --> 42:01.574
I told Miranda to
stop it, but she didn't.

42:01.577 --> 42:03.176
And I don't know why.

42:03.179 --> 42:05.579
And I don't know what happened to Alex.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.943
She's in the building.

42:10.852 --> 42:12.685
Shoot on sight.

42:14.079 --> 42:15.979
Okay. Let's do this.
