01:01.326 --> 01:02.658
It was the spring of '85.

01:05.797 --> 01:07.459
My town was hit
by a massive typhoon.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.465
It was called Brenda, I think.

01:12.270 --> 01:16.071
My father went out to the sea
and never returned.

01:19.177 --> 01:22.306
Since that summer,

01:22.948 --> 01:26.146
we became just the three of us.

01:28.219 --> 01:30.950
Me and my brother stopped
going to school.

01:32.023 --> 01:33.548
We stayed home all day waiting
for our mother to come home.

01:35.026 --> 01:37.689
She would leave at the break of dawn

01:37.996 --> 01:42.297
to do whatever work she could find.

01:43.868 --> 01:48.306
Often, she came home very late

01:49.841 --> 01:52.834
and cried watching our sleeping faces.

01:56.348 --> 02:00.979
The world was a tough place for a
woman to raise two boys on her own.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.957
And eventually, we ended up

02:14.132 --> 02:15.998
being just the two of us.

02:18.937 --> 02:28.936
We Are Brothers

02:44.696 --> 02:45.720
Oh, man...

02:47.465 --> 02:48.091
This is amazing.

02:48.767 --> 02:52.169
I absolutely dig the closing track.
Great job.

02:52.871 --> 02:59.141
This episode's going to be our
jackpot for the family month of May.

02:59.210 --> 03:00.337
Whose idea was it?

03:00.679 --> 03:04.275
It was Yang's.
She really hit it out of the park.

03:04.683 --> 03:08.711
Indeed. Kudos to Yang!

03:09.320 --> 03:10.754
Yang?

03:12.057 --> 03:12.922
Huh?

03:13.992 --> 03:14.982
Where is she?

03:15.860 --> 03:20.298
Scan the room with the camera.
Check all corners.

03:20.532 --> 03:23.168
Okay...

03:23.168 --> 03:23.965
Stop!

03:24.335 --> 03:25.064
Go back a little.

03:26.471 --> 03:27.200
Pull in.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.646
How can she sleep like that?

03:35.714 --> 03:39.583
If anybody has a gun,
can you please shoot her?

04:03.942 --> 04:06.741
<i>Meeting You Today.</i>

04:07.078 --> 04:11.149
Ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly
be arriving at Incheon International.

04:11.149 --> 04:14.753
Please ensure that your luggage is
stowed in the overhead compartment,

04:14.753 --> 04:18.382
seats in the upright position
and tray table stowed.

04:25.130 --> 04:28.225
Hello, my name is Park Sang-yeon.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.236
I was adopted into the States
when I was nine years old.

04:32.570 --> 04:36.701
I wish to find my biological mother

04:37.742 --> 04:42.578
and my brother who is
two years younger than me.

04:43.181 --> 04:44.376
Did you check the arrival time?

04:45.750 --> 04:49.448
Be there early.
Take the subway if traffic is bad.

04:50.021 --> 04:50.818
Okay?

04:56.761 --> 04:57.456
Hey!

04:58.363 --> 05:02.600
Forget the pills.
You need proper psychiatric help.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.264
Don't treat me like I'm crazy.
It's just a sleeping disorder.

05:06.504 --> 05:08.439
Crazy?

05:08.940 --> 05:12.744
Dozing off twenty times a day
isn't just a sleeping disorder.

05:12.744 --> 05:16.181
Narcolepsy is a serious condition.

05:16.181 --> 05:18.446
You shouldn't be allowed to drive.

05:20.919 --> 05:21.978
Who's at the airport?

05:22.353 --> 05:25.551
Kim. The plane just landed.

05:26.357 --> 05:27.484
What about the younger brother?

05:32.063 --> 05:32.463
Are you on your way?

05:32.463 --> 05:37.769
The funeral cortege of the late
senior lawmaker Kim Man-jae

05:37.769 --> 05:41.433
will leave the hospital
this morning.

05:41.873 --> 05:44.035
The former congressman...

05:45.176 --> 05:45.871
You should sit down.

05:46.845 --> 05:47.972
No, mister!

05:48.813 --> 05:50.782
You should sit.
You look awfully tired.

05:53.218 --> 05:54.811
We'll just stand then.

05:58.323 --> 06:01.693
The cortege will pass the National
Assembly Hall where Kim devoted...

06:01.693 --> 06:05.152
She's my mother.
Don't look at me like that.

06:05.663 --> 06:07.325
Go ahead. Take the seat, mister.

06:08.399 --> 06:12.103
The Prosecutors' Office announced
that their investigation into

06:12.103 --> 06:17.075
corruption charges against the late
Congressman Kim will continue...

06:17.075 --> 06:20.912
Traffic is moving well.
We'll arrive in good time.

06:20.912 --> 06:24.449
- Yes...
- Congressman Kim passed away?

06:24.449 --> 06:26.718
- Pardon me?
- Life is so transient.

06:26.718 --> 06:29.153
Can you turn that down a little?

06:31.089 --> 06:31.749
Yes.

06:32.590 --> 06:35.389
You wanna do a follow cam
from the entrance?

06:36.027 --> 06:37.154
Am I gonna be in the frame, too?

06:37.595 --> 06:41.794
You should've told me.
I'm not wearing any make up.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.506
Mom,

07:00.251 --> 07:03.983
we're going to meet Sang-yeon.

07:05.323 --> 07:08.691
Sang-yeon, mom...

07:10.061 --> 07:11.051
You know who that is, don't you?

07:12.163 --> 07:15.531
The son you had two years
before you had me.

07:16.634 --> 07:17.567
Remember?

07:19.537 --> 07:20.402
I know.

07:20.939 --> 07:21.929
My eldest son.

07:23.675 --> 07:24.836
Sang-yeon is...

07:26.311 --> 07:27.301
coming here?

07:30.448 --> 07:31.973
That's right. He's here.

07:33.918 --> 07:39.516
It's all good.
Come on, have some eggs.

07:39.657 --> 07:41.182
Don't stuff them down.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.355
Have some water.

07:46.731 --> 07:49.963
It's all good.

07:53.004 --> 07:56.774
It's commercial break.
We'll have you on first,

07:56.774 --> 07:58.174
then, your mother at the end.

07:59.677 --> 08:01.305
Are you feeling peckish, Mrs. Park?

08:02.914 --> 08:06.510
That gentleman gave these to me.
He did a good job boiling them.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.820
You should have one, too.

08:09.754 --> 08:13.791
Making the shell slide off like this

08:13.791 --> 08:15.919
is trickier than you'd think.

08:16.694 --> 08:19.687
He must be quite skilled.

08:20.331 --> 08:23.568
No, mom! You cooked them.
You got up before the break of dawn

08:23.568 --> 08:26.604
to boil those eggs yourself.

08:26.604 --> 08:28.800
You can't stay lucid
for five minutes?

08:29.440 --> 08:33.177
I'm worried that my mother will
lose her mind again on stage.

08:33.177 --> 08:34.543
Do we really have to do this?

08:34.879 --> 08:40.351
The focus is on you and your brother
rather than her.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.013
I need to pee, dear.

08:42.653 --> 08:43.916
I think I'll go, too.

08:44.522 --> 08:45.615
No, it's this way.

08:46.024 --> 08:48.926
Mrs. Park, that's the closet.
Bathroom's this way.

08:55.033 --> 08:56.228
So... this is it?

08:58.136 --> 09:03.507
They're here,
my mother and my brother?

09:07.779 --> 09:09.975
You'd rather meet them right away,
wouldn't you?

09:11.049 --> 09:12.813
It's cruel,
this television business.

09:14.218 --> 09:17.245
You will meet them in just
a few moments.

09:26.230 --> 09:30.435
<i>Did you forget all about me?</i>

09:30.435 --> 09:33.371
Do you like the show that
you were watching, Mrs. Park?

09:36.808 --> 09:41.245
- Here's my card. I'll send you tickets.
<i>- Beautiful like a flower...</i>

09:41.245 --> 09:45.182
<i>Sun-yi, O, Sun-yi</i>

09:49.087 --> 09:50.646
Going live on air in five.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.351
Is the older brother on standby?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.258
He's gone to the bathroom.

09:57.562 --> 09:59.997
He should be on standby.
It's five minutes to go.

10:00.298 --> 10:01.332
What about the younger brother?

10:01.332 --> 10:02.891
He and his mother also needed
the toilet.

10:03.201 --> 10:04.294
It must be the nerves.

10:05.303 --> 10:06.327
Man...

10:07.538 --> 10:12.442
Seriously? They all had to go now?

10:51.983 --> 10:53.076
Hello?

10:55.286 --> 10:56.914
Is anybody there?

11:01.359 --> 11:02.054
Yes.

11:03.995 --> 11:05.190
Can you help me?

11:05.630 --> 11:08.566
Can you pass some toilet paper
from adjacent cubicles?

11:09.333 --> 11:11.859
Thank goodness for you!

11:13.337 --> 11:16.474
I would've used my socks

11:16.474 --> 11:18.543
but I guess I had too many eggs,

11:18.543 --> 11:21.179
you know what I'm saying?

11:21.179 --> 11:24.415
Other cubicles are out, too.

11:24.415 --> 11:24.849
What?

11:24.849 --> 11:26.408
I'll get someone.

11:26.517 --> 11:29.887
No... hey! Do you have anything?
Newspaper?

11:29.887 --> 11:32.857
Hey! Excuse me!

11:33.558 --> 11:35.092
I'll be right back.

11:35.092 --> 11:37.428
Oh, you're still here.
You know I'm in a real hurry...

11:37.428 --> 11:39.124
A bucket of water, then?

11:39.430 --> 11:41.899
<i>Where are you now?</i>

11:42.500 --> 11:47.063
<i>Are thoughts of me forgotten?</i>

11:47.605 --> 11:53.806
<i>Beautiful like a flower,
your lovely name was</i>

11:54.212 --> 11:59.913
<i>Sun-yi, O, Sun-yi</i>

12:00.384 --> 12:06.449
<i>The waves are rising above the pier</i>

12:06.557 --> 12:13.088
<i>Our time that has passed
still remains in my heart</i>

12:13.931 --> 12:19.165
Sang-yeon, don't go!

12:19.570 --> 12:23.371
Don't leave me.

12:25.142 --> 12:26.110
Ha-yeon!

12:57.808 --> 12:58.832
Sang-yeon.

12:59.644 --> 13:00.244
Yes.

13:00.244 --> 13:04.340
Your eyes are brimming with tears.

13:05.149 --> 13:08.853
Did the film bring back
some of the memories?

13:08.853 --> 13:13.951
It may have faded since
it happened so long ago.

13:17.528 --> 13:18.689
I remember.

13:20.264 --> 13:21.596
I remember everything clearly.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.764
I'm not gonna cry.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.530
I'm not gonna cry.

13:30.408 --> 13:32.900
Mrs. Park!

13:40.651 --> 13:41.914
This way, everyone.

13:42.453 --> 13:44.155
Please have us back.
It was wonderful.

13:44.155 --> 13:45.714
Watch your steps.

13:46.757 --> 13:47.690
Did you enjoy the show?

13:48.993 --> 13:51.462
Watch your steps.
Go to the left.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.095
The count is wrong.

13:56.534 --> 13:59.003
What's the matter?
Are we short?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.235
No... We've got one extra.

14:01.305 --> 14:04.241
As long as we aren't short,
that's fine by me.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.537
Damn, where did I go wrong?

14:06.811 --> 14:08.302
We gotta leave before the rush hour.

14:11.449 --> 14:12.417
Ha-yeon...

14:21.392 --> 14:22.325
Ha-yeon!

14:27.798 --> 14:28.766
Ha-yeon!

14:57.194 --> 15:00.028
Mrs. Park.

15:01.866 --> 15:05.200
Mrs. Park... Oh, shit.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.149
I was a seven year old kid.

15:23.354 --> 15:25.755
Scared and starved...

15:26.757 --> 15:30.524
I ran away from the orphanage
a few days after he left.

15:31.562 --> 15:34.862
I looked around everywhere
trying to find mom and my brother.

15:35.232 --> 15:37.861
Then, by grace of Heavens,

15:38.469 --> 15:44.208
I was taken under the wings
of my spiritual mentor.

15:44.208 --> 15:50.114
Now I'm living happily serving
spirits of Six Heavens.

15:50.114 --> 15:52.743
So, you've become a shaman.

15:52.983 --> 15:55.350
A spiritual being.

15:55.786 --> 15:56.719
I see.

15:59.056 --> 16:03.118
Now let's hear the story
of the older brother.

16:04.862 --> 16:06.763
What is your profession?

16:14.138 --> 16:17.608
Maybe he's a little nervous.

16:17.608 --> 16:19.839
Please give him a round of applause.

16:31.789 --> 16:33.155
I'm a pastor.

16:40.731 --> 16:41.562
You!

16:42.399 --> 16:45.301
What's this nonsense?

16:46.103 --> 16:50.404
You brought us here
to be torn apart again?

16:51.041 --> 16:51.940
I'm terribly sorry
for what happened.

16:52.810 --> 16:56.247
Are you sure she's still
in the building?

16:56.247 --> 17:00.351
We're checking all our video
surveillances.

17:00.351 --> 17:04.220
- Please find her.
- is this the middle of the ocean?

17:04.788 --> 17:06.991
Why can't you find her
if she's here?

17:06.991 --> 17:10.951
- Good afternoon.
- this is our chief.

17:11.595 --> 17:15.098
I am terribly sorry
for what happened.

17:15.098 --> 17:16.666
I assure you that
we'll do our best to...

17:16.666 --> 17:19.502
Are you this man's boss?

17:19.502 --> 17:21.505
I'm the chief of division...

17:21.505 --> 17:27.035
How can this nonsense
happen to my mother?

17:27.444 --> 17:30.481
Is this a show that finds
people or loses people?

17:30.481 --> 17:33.076
What's going on here?

17:34.118 --> 17:36.451
What do you mean
someone's gone missing?

17:36.987 --> 17:38.250
Who the hell are you?

17:39.223 --> 17:40.953
I'm the head of department.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.561
This man is this man's boss.

17:52.136 --> 17:53.069
Hello!

17:54.872 --> 17:57.171
We found her.

17:59.577 --> 18:02.372
I just can't believe this.

18:02.846 --> 18:05.849
How could she have ended up
50 miles from here?

18:05.849 --> 18:09.787
Was she teleported out
of the station?

18:09.787 --> 18:14.058
At least we know where she is.

18:14.058 --> 18:15.993
Why don't you get some shut-eye?
I'll wake you when we arrive.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.325
Are you kidding me?

18:17.561 --> 18:20.156
Could you sleep if your mother
went missing two hours ago?

18:23.067 --> 18:26.936
Who in their right mind dozes off
while washing their hands?

18:30.341 --> 18:34.108
Why don't you talk to your
older brother?

18:34.345 --> 18:36.109
You must have a lot to catch up.

18:37.047 --> 18:37.878
Who are you calling older brother?

18:38.182 --> 18:40.481
You think I'm the older brother?

18:41.919 --> 18:45.089
My bad! It's because of
your traditional costume...

18:45.089 --> 18:48.459
It's Sang-yeon and Ha-yeon.
As in 'top' and 'bottom.'

18:48.459 --> 18:50.427
That's what it is.

18:50.427 --> 18:51.762
My name is Jung-sik,
as in 'middle.'

18:51.762 --> 18:56.666
Top, middle and bottom, damn it!
I can't believe you people.

18:58.035 --> 19:00.061
Turn on the radio or something.

19:01.305 --> 19:05.576
<i>O precious blood of Jesus...</i>

19:05.576 --> 19:06.874
Turn the damn thing off.

19:07.678 --> 19:14.385
...traffic is heavy in 39Km stretch
between Pangyo and Cheonan...

19:14.385 --> 19:18.686
Clear spells throughout the day
and UV alert is issued...

19:30.501 --> 19:33.994
Why is it parked so far
from the entrance?

19:34.605 --> 19:35.800
I can't believe we're doing this.

19:38.175 --> 19:39.143
Mother...

19:41.178 --> 19:42.476
You said she was here.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.983
Why are you keeping us stalled here?

19:45.983 --> 19:47.785
I need to go home and feed my dog.

19:47.785 --> 19:51.221
You're worried about your damn dog
at a time like this?

19:51.221 --> 19:55.693
Excuse me but we're
looking for an old lady

19:55.693 --> 20:00.731
in a pink cardigan with a southern
accent. Has anyone seen her?

20:00.731 --> 20:04.259
Are you talking about the woman

20:05.035 --> 20:08.072
who was sitting next to me

20:08.072 --> 20:11.338
and poking her fingers into the air
to the music?

20:11.675 --> 20:12.802
Poking her fingers in the air

20:14.845 --> 20:15.778
like this?

20:17.214 --> 20:18.147
That's her.

20:19.717 --> 20:21.345
That's my mother.

20:21.585 --> 20:22.986
Where is she now?

20:22.986 --> 20:24.888
She said she needed the bathroom.

20:24.888 --> 20:28.086
She got off and went back and forth
between those buses.

20:28.492 --> 20:30.694
So, that must be her!

20:30.694 --> 20:32.959
She disappeared into the back.

20:35.766 --> 20:40.932
Why can't she just stay in one place?

20:46.477 --> 20:50.471
Journalists are still following us.
Will they follow us to the cemetery?

20:50.581 --> 20:53.951
Don't worry about them.
The more they come, the merrier.

20:53.951 --> 20:56.921
He's just gonna have to
take it all down with him.

20:57.654 --> 21:01.182
Consider it his last tribute to the party.
We'll leverage it for the next election.

21:01.258 --> 21:02.920
They won't dig into any more scandals?

21:03.494 --> 21:06.089
The right of arraignment will expire
by the time we get back.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.663
We should've cremated and
placed him closer to the city.

21:13.337 --> 21:16.273
If only the stubborn elders didn't
insist on family cemetery.

21:17.274 --> 21:20.642
We're the ones who have to go
to the country every year.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.873
You should be thankful that he
didn't die during the vacation season.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.182
Imagine having to drive
there in traffic.

21:31.855 --> 21:32.823
I won't even think about it.

21:35.058 --> 21:38.688
Who's that granny?
Was she riding with us all along?

21:41.698 --> 21:43.667
Her pink sweater really bothers me.

21:58.582 --> 21:59.641
Oh, darling...

22:01.852 --> 22:05.084
What am I gonna do with our sons?

22:07.024 --> 22:14.056
How am I to raise them on my own?

22:18.569 --> 22:21.538
We don't know who you are.

22:21.538 --> 22:23.240
But you can't be doing this.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.142
She planned it all out.

22:26.443 --> 22:29.641
She followed us to the rest stop
and snuck onto the bus.

22:30.447 --> 22:33.016
Her sons must be here, too.

22:33.016 --> 22:35.319
Where the hell are they?
I'm gonna kill them.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.921
Calm down. No need to get heated up.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.257
Don't tell me to calm down
when she's clearly

22:40.257 --> 22:41.892
after the little inheritance we got.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.088
Will you pay her from your share?

22:44.828 --> 22:47.831
- How could dad do this to us?
- Shut up!

22:47.831 --> 22:51.168
- Damn you, you evil old man!
- Calm down, mother.

22:51.168 --> 22:54.371
Why should I bury him?

22:54.371 --> 22:55.806
- Will you Please Calm down?
- Where did this bitch go?

22:55.806 --> 22:57.707
I'll bury her with him.

23:01.578 --> 23:03.547
Take a deep breath.

23:08.151 --> 23:11.053
I don't know how you were
involved with my father.

23:13.590 --> 23:16.958
Clearly, you knew him well enough
to come this far.

23:17.728 --> 23:21.498
But you aren't doing right by him.

23:21.498 --> 23:24.525
What you're doing is
killing him twice over.

23:36.613 --> 23:38.639
This is the condolence money
from the wake.

23:39.116 --> 23:42.819
You might not know this
but he had a huge debt.

23:42.819 --> 23:46.722
It costs a lot to run for congress
however clean you want to be.

23:47.424 --> 23:49.290
We sacrificed a lot as a family.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.092
I don't want to you have hard feelings.
Take this money and move on.

23:55.032 --> 23:57.367
If you were in a secret relationship

23:57.367 --> 24:01.605
you should keep his honor to the end.
That's true love.

24:01.605 --> 24:03.540
Don't take us for pushovers.

24:04.441 --> 24:07.978
Ma'am, now you're going to walk away

24:07.978 --> 24:10.607
and erase my father's memory forever
from your mind, okay?

24:11.181 --> 24:12.581
Let's go. Get on the bus.

24:15.752 --> 24:17.421
Mother, please!

24:17.421 --> 24:19.390
- Oh, come on!
- How could he do this?

24:48.485 --> 24:53.480
What kind of rotten bastards ditch
an old lady by the expressway?

24:53.890 --> 24:56.621
Where did they go?
I swear I'll teach them a lesson.

24:56.960 --> 25:01.865
Trailer trucks run at 120 mph here.

25:01.865 --> 25:06.737
They can knock over a 200 pound deer
just by driving past it.

25:06.737 --> 25:10.174
The roadkills you see with
no visible damages...

25:10.240 --> 25:12.937
That's how they got killed.

25:13.143 --> 25:16.773
What they did to you is
an attempted murder.

25:17.814 --> 25:22.184
I got the wrong train, you know.

25:22.486 --> 25:25.820
What kind of a train stops on a highway?

25:25.889 --> 25:27.585
Galaxy Express 999?

25:28.191 --> 25:32.356
I don't know the number.

25:33.730 --> 25:37.098
How can you take their side
in these circumstances?

25:37.567 --> 25:41.163
Forget it. Just give me their address.

25:41.338 --> 25:45.409
Was it your son or daughter who did this?
I swear I'll track them down

25:45.409 --> 25:47.469
and I'll break their damn legs.

25:48.178 --> 25:53.984
Multi-vehicle collision near
Daejeon exit on Gyeongbu Expressway

25:53.984 --> 26:00.288
Tow trucks in the area, please report.
Let's make some money!

26:08.865 --> 26:12.302
I put in a request to check
all buses passing toll gates.

26:12.302 --> 26:13.793
We'll hear from them shortly.

26:14.104 --> 26:16.573
That's fucking fantastic. Well done.

26:16.573 --> 26:17.802
Don't be like that.

26:18.608 --> 26:20.201
I appreciate your effort.

26:21.611 --> 26:23.512
Are you filming this?

26:23.847 --> 26:24.644
Sorry?

26:25.015 --> 26:27.851
I talked to my boss.

26:27.851 --> 26:31.588
He thinks if we air your search effort

26:31.588 --> 26:33.819
it could help find your mother.

26:34.658 --> 26:35.921
So, you want to film us again?

26:36.526 --> 26:38.722
Are you trying to get
my brother lost, too?

26:38.895 --> 26:43.133
But there is nothing more effective
for finding missing people.

26:43.133 --> 26:45.802
You mean after what
you've done to lose her?

26:45.802 --> 26:48.338
You gotta change the name
of your stupid show.

26:48.338 --> 26:51.541
Come on, man.
We should try everything.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.442
What we all want is to find her. Right?

26:55.879 --> 26:57.871
So, you want to follow us
to my house?

26:58.582 --> 26:59.242
That's the idea.

26:59.516 --> 27:02.619
Then, why did we get off?
We can go there in your stupid car.

27:02.619 --> 27:05.655
- I'll put my luggage in the car.
- We're shooting it like a documentary.

27:05.655 --> 27:08.592
So, I want to shoot you
walk toward your house.

27:08.592 --> 27:10.026
Then, we'll drive there

27:10.360 --> 27:13.296
and, shoot you step into
the house from there.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.193
To build in a narrative.

27:15.665 --> 27:20.694
If you connect the footages,
it'll look real.

27:21.171 --> 27:21.866
That's the idea.

27:22.339 --> 27:23.967
Then, how about this?

27:25.142 --> 27:27.976
When we arrive at the house,

27:28.478 --> 27:30.847
we could look tired and worried...

27:30.847 --> 27:35.012
even a little out of breath.

27:35.719 --> 27:38.088
You understand television.
Have you done this before?

27:38.088 --> 27:40.353
No, never.

27:40.423 --> 27:42.255
That is fucking wonderful!

27:42.359 --> 27:44.427
You'll end up with a masterpiece.

27:44.427 --> 27:45.952
The whole thing is damn joke.

27:47.197 --> 27:48.995
Ha-yeon, you need to wait
for a cue before you go.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.416
So, this is where you live.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.684
It's nice... With flags and all.

28:13.223 --> 28:14.623
What a nice little cottage!

28:17.194 --> 28:18.321
It's a shrine.

28:20.130 --> 28:20.961
A shrine!

28:23.066 --> 28:24.534
Yeah, okay.

28:30.774 --> 28:34.472
Can you finish up here?

28:35.378 --> 28:36.676
Are you leaving?

28:37.013 --> 28:39.916
They want me to start editing right away.

28:39.916 --> 28:41.441
I'm screwed.

28:43.553 --> 28:44.851
I'll come back tomorrow.

28:45.422 --> 28:46.822
Sure you will.

28:46.890 --> 28:47.983
Come on...

29:06.042 --> 29:09.672
How did you end up doing this?

29:17.020 --> 29:18.010
You know...

29:21.224 --> 29:26.288
Isn't that something you'd say
to someone locked up in jail?

29:27.564 --> 29:30.193
How did you end up killing a man?

29:30.634 --> 29:33.627
How did you end up in this mess?

29:34.304 --> 29:36.466
In situations like that.

29:38.174 --> 29:40.109
It's not like I'm doing something awful.

29:42.812 --> 29:44.508
How did you end up doing what you do?

29:46.082 --> 29:46.683
Excuse me?

29:46.683 --> 29:48.276
How does that make you feel
to hear that?

29:50.587 --> 29:51.680
Shitty, I guess.

29:52.289 --> 29:54.349
You know what I mean?

30:03.767 --> 30:07.169
Help yourselves. Dig in.

30:07.604 --> 30:10.373
It's not supposed to be served
individually American style.

30:10.373 --> 30:13.104
When did you prepare all this?

30:13.610 --> 30:16.279
Heavenly Father full of grace,

30:16.279 --> 30:18.682
thank you for this food
that we're about to receive.

30:18.682 --> 30:21.481
I prepared the meal.
Who is he thanking?

30:21.918 --> 30:24.654
We thank you for another peaceful day.

30:24.654 --> 30:27.691
I've never had a more spectacular day
in my life.

30:27.691 --> 30:28.825
Was it a peaceful day for you?

30:28.825 --> 30:32.195
- and for reuniting me with my brother.
- Silently, if you can!

30:32.195 --> 30:33.857
Does he have any manners?
He's in a shamanist shrine.

30:36.599 --> 30:37.225
Amen.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.099
Enjoy your meal.

30:46.543 --> 30:48.307
Wow, this is amazing.

30:49.779 --> 30:52.180
Living on your own turned
you into some cook.

30:52.615 --> 30:53.742
I didn't make it.

30:54.284 --> 30:57.020
Mother becomes lucid
20 mins or so every other day.

30:57.020 --> 31:00.590
She got me to kill a chicken
to prepare this soup.

31:00.590 --> 31:05.119
She even got me to get abalones.

31:11.468 --> 31:13.027
You should've left early.

31:14.838 --> 31:17.774
We'll catch the last bus if we hurry.

31:17.774 --> 31:19.470
Sorry about that.

31:21.311 --> 31:26.340
Why are you so brusk to your brother?
You've been reunited after a long time.

31:26.416 --> 31:28.612
What are you talking about?
I'm doing just fine.

31:30.854 --> 31:33.790
Never mind others' family business.

31:35.225 --> 31:36.989
I just met my brother and came home.

31:37.994 --> 31:39.292
Already had dinner, too.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.399
Now it's evening hours out here.

31:44.401 --> 31:45.596
Did I call you too early?

31:48.471 --> 31:49.939
How is our little guy doing?

31:52.208 --> 31:53.642
Don't worry about me.

31:55.779 --> 31:58.146
Oh right, about to buy our Chris a gift.

31:58.982 --> 31:59.950
What do you think would be better?

32:04.654 --> 32:05.688
That's good. That would be better.

32:05.688 --> 32:06.712
I'm guessing he will really like it.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.459
Don't worry. Of course I liked...

32:13.797 --> 32:16.833
I heard Americans like
t-shirts with English letters.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.495
Put this on and give them
your best smile.

32:18.968 --> 32:22.138
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

32:22.138 --> 32:25.666
You'll go with them first.
They'll come for me later.

32:29.779 --> 32:32.982
This boy...

32:32.982 --> 32:35.151
is the smartest one here.

32:35.151 --> 32:37.954
He's smart and polite, too.

32:37.954 --> 32:39.855
He's a good boy.
A good student!

32:41.090 --> 32:44.959
Hey~!
What's your name?

32:46.396 --> 32:47.730
I want...

32:47.730 --> 32:49.999
my brother...

32:49.999 --> 32:50.989
America.

33:02.512 --> 33:04.708
How do you know we have a son?

33:08.751 --> 33:09.810
Do you want to meet him?

33:13.056 --> 33:15.992
Honey, I think we found our boy.

33:29.706 --> 33:32.266
You should hurry
or you'll miss your flight.

33:33.176 --> 33:34.667
I don't see my brother.

33:35.078 --> 33:36.613
I gotta see him before I go.

33:36.613 --> 33:39.082
I told you

33:39.082 --> 33:42.185
your parents will come back
next month to get your brother.

33:42.185 --> 33:46.281
Don't jeopardize this chance
for both of you.

33:47.257 --> 33:48.020
Come on.

33:58.468 --> 33:59.492
Ha-yeon!

34:00.803 --> 34:01.498
Sang-yeon!

34:01.838 --> 34:03.136
Ha-yeon!

34:03.673 --> 34:04.606
Sang-yeon!

34:05.775 --> 34:07.310
Ha-yeon!

34:07.310 --> 34:08.333
Sang-yeon!

34:10.847 --> 34:12.076
I called you too early.

34:12.949 --> 34:14.610
I'll let you go back to sleep.

34:15.717 --> 34:17.311
Ok. I'll call you later.

34:18.187 --> 34:20.053
Sweet dream.
Bye.

34:30.433 --> 34:33.130
I must look weird
talking in English and all.

34:36.906 --> 34:39.137
It's more weird that you
speak Korean with no accent.

34:40.909 --> 34:41.878
Come on in.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.710
You're not married?

34:53.056 --> 34:55.753
It's not easy for someone
in my profession to get married.

34:57.827 --> 34:58.920
What about you?

34:59.862 --> 35:01.854
It's hard for someone in my profession
not to be married.

35:03.132 --> 35:03.929
What's your wife like?

35:05.435 --> 35:08.667
Is she blonde and has blue eyes?

35:09.539 --> 35:12.566
Green. And, we have a son.

35:15.311 --> 35:17.143
Mom will be thrilled to
meet your mixed-blood son.

35:20.183 --> 35:25.588
Well, she has difficulty recognizing
you. So, it won't matter.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.093
How long has she been like that?

35:31.127 --> 35:34.359
I've looked everywhere for her

35:36.065 --> 35:37.829
until I finally tracked her down
at a nursing home for senile people.

35:38.434 --> 35:42.064
I don't know what kind of life she had

35:43.006 --> 35:45.100
to have no one to look after her.

35:46.075 --> 35:48.772
She had a huge outstanding
medical bill.

35:49.646 --> 35:51.514
To pay that off,

35:51.514 --> 35:54.313
I had to perform three rituals a day.
It screwed my back.

35:57.587 --> 35:58.714
You perform rituals, too?

35:59.522 --> 36:00.615
Do I perform rituals?

36:03.059 --> 36:04.618
That's all I do.

36:05.061 --> 36:06.222
Ritual is what I specialize in.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.193
Go to sleep.
I'll sleep in the other room.

36:13.403 --> 36:14.336
Dear God...

36:24.480 --> 36:25.081
Hello?

36:25.081 --> 36:27.316
We got a tip.

36:27.316 --> 36:28.418
Where?

36:28.418 --> 36:29.852
The call came from Daejeon.

36:29.986 --> 36:31.010
Daejeon?

36:32.889 --> 36:34.924
How on earth did she get there?

36:34.924 --> 36:39.555
We don't know much else yet.

36:39.629 --> 36:40.653
Alright.

36:56.512 --> 36:57.241
Are you in there?

36:57.680 --> 36:59.080
Hey! Hi!

37:00.349 --> 37:02.682
You woke up early.

37:03.486 --> 37:05.421
Must be the jet lag.

37:06.589 --> 37:08.057
Are you getting hot water?

37:08.858 --> 37:10.827
Yeah, thanks. It's great.

37:12.328 --> 37:15.965
They had a call from Daejeon.
It could be our mother.

37:15.965 --> 37:16.966
Really?

37:16.966 --> 37:18.534
I think we should go there.

37:18.534 --> 37:20.059
Sure. I'll finish up quickly.

37:27.610 --> 37:29.545
She left expensive equipment
lying around.

37:40.456 --> 37:42.687
Park Sang-yeon's interview...

37:49.332 --> 37:53.428
He is undergoing a treatment...
excuse me.

37:54.871 --> 37:58.273
There isn't much we can do
even as a family.

37:59.075 --> 38:02.341
He is in quite serious condition.

38:03.946 --> 38:09.185
He's desperately in need of
a bone marrow transplant.

38:09.185 --> 38:13.680
That's pretty much
the only chance he's got.

38:38.114 --> 38:41.414
But I can't do anything for him.

38:43.219 --> 38:47.452
There is nothing I wouldn't do

38:47.890 --> 38:51.486
to save my son's life.

38:52.328 --> 38:56.789
I can only hope that
he'll find a matching donor

38:57.600 --> 39:01.799
and be happy again...

39:22.358 --> 39:23.626
Hey, writer!

39:23.626 --> 39:24.650
Hi!

39:28.931 --> 39:29.626
Is she here?

39:29.866 --> 39:33.928
Let's meet the terminal staff
who called us.

39:35.504 --> 39:39.575
She got off a tow truck

39:39.575 --> 39:43.444
and went straight to the
ticket office.

39:44.146 --> 39:46.138
So, I stopped her and asked,

39:46.816 --> 39:51.087
'Are you okay? How come
you're in such a hurry...

39:51.087 --> 39:54.854
like a fugitive on the run?'

39:55.358 --> 39:58.886
She just ignored me and went off.

40:01.597 --> 40:06.001
So, I turned to the tow truck driver.

40:06.402 --> 40:07.970
And, he goes:

40:07.970 --> 40:10.769
Some rotten bastard abandoned
his senile mother and fled.

40:11.641 --> 40:17.877
Then, the truck driver drove off, too.

40:19.815 --> 40:23.115
There I am standing dazed.

40:24.020 --> 40:28.355
Then, I saw this leaflet and realized
that it was the old lady I just saw.

40:28.658 --> 40:32.095
She didn't have any money on her
to buy a bus ticket.

40:32.695 --> 40:36.063
She must still be somewhere close.

40:36.933 --> 40:43.430
I don't think she is in the terminal.

40:43.806 --> 40:47.607
<i>Daejeon Bus Terminal</i>

40:55.117 --> 40:56.244
Look over there.

40:58.154 --> 40:59.019
Those two?

40:59.088 --> 41:00.181
Yeah.

41:01.057 --> 41:03.083
How do you think they are related?

41:04.827 --> 41:08.286
They don't look like they're close.

41:09.398 --> 41:12.300
That suit and traditional costume
don't go together.

41:12.568 --> 41:17.871
The one in the costume
must be a folk musician.

41:18.741 --> 41:23.475
A good one, too.
He's oozing charisma.

41:24.180 --> 41:25.614
What about the suit?

41:28.751 --> 41:29.616
That's the manager.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.856
I can tell from a glance that
he's younger than the musician.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.924
Probably with no real job
so, he's helping out the musician.

41:38.361 --> 41:40.956
You take the suit.
I'll go for the costume.

41:41.364 --> 41:43.856
Have you seen this person?

41:48.571 --> 41:49.672
What's the matter with you?

41:49.672 --> 41:50.339
Hey!

41:50.339 --> 41:50.873
What happened?

41:50.873 --> 41:52.174
- Hello?
- this man needs help...

41:52.174 --> 41:53.073
Does he need help?

41:53.876 --> 41:54.468
Is he okay?

41:55.111 --> 41:55.811
Are you alright?

41:55.811 --> 41:57.847
Dear me...

41:57.847 --> 41:58.507
Are you okay?

42:05.588 --> 42:06.389
Are you alright?

42:06.389 --> 42:07.118
You alright?

42:10.659 --> 42:12.821
What is it?

42:15.698 --> 42:16.688
He's not a cop, is he?

42:18.834 --> 42:19.733
A pastor.

42:20.803 --> 42:21.634
A pastor?

42:23.205 --> 42:24.935
Not a carpenter but a pastor?

42:26.609 --> 42:28.043
I don't like this.

42:29.412 --> 42:30.311
Let's see yours.

42:30.880 --> 42:34.350
Nothing special.
Just some cash and a bus ticket,

42:34.350 --> 42:35.409
some I.D. and...

42:36.952 --> 42:38.420
What's this?

42:38.754 --> 42:39.312
What is it?

42:51.767 --> 42:54.862
Nothing to be alarmed about.
People carry amulets. No big deal.

43:00.776 --> 43:03.871
Some carry a couple,
if the problem is serious.

43:12.888 --> 43:13.753
Oh...

43:18.060 --> 43:19.187
Good Lord...

43:20.262 --> 43:23.130
You shouldn't be out and about
on a jinxed day like this.

43:23.599 --> 43:24.700
Father...

43:24.700 --> 43:26.202
Stop calling your god!

43:26.202 --> 43:30.503
Do you think I have no gods to call on?

43:34.376 --> 43:37.904
I have some money I can loan you,
if you want.

43:43.152 --> 43:46.486
If you can kindly let us borrow
some for bus tickets.

43:47.056 --> 43:48.149
Can we borrow about 50 bucks?

43:48.958 --> 43:53.462
50 dollars?
Then, I gotta find an ATM.

43:53.462 --> 43:57.160
Are you kidding me?
How much were you gonna loan us?

43:59.168 --> 44:02.536
ATM is over there.

44:06.242 --> 44:07.232
Thank you.

44:12.181 --> 44:12.841
Bro.

44:14.817 --> 44:16.308
Is this really necessary?

44:20.556 --> 44:25.551
What happened to your mate
who stole an organ from church?

44:26.729 --> 44:28.764
He went to a music store to sell it

44:28.764 --> 44:32.668
then, slipped on the stairs
and broke six ribs.

44:32.668 --> 44:37.197
What about my mate, Dae-sik,
who snatched a monk's donation bag?

44:37.740 --> 44:39.208
Let's not talk about him.

44:39.208 --> 44:42.474
He got hit by a southbound bus
then, crushed by a northbound bus.

44:43.612 --> 44:45.080
I swore to myself after that day

44:45.981 --> 44:49.509
that I will never challenge
divine territories.

44:51.787 --> 44:52.516
Let's go.

44:53.355 --> 44:57.986
All will be well as long as
we put it back to its place.

45:00.663 --> 45:01.995
Do you really think we can do it?

45:03.032 --> 45:05.661
Throughout the 20 years of my career

45:06.135 --> 45:07.967
I've never slipped something back in.

45:15.544 --> 45:18.446
We just need to do the process
in the reverse order.

45:20.549 --> 45:22.450
What about money for mom's operation?

45:24.553 --> 45:25.987
In any case, we can't do this.

45:27.022 --> 45:28.490
I'll work harder from now.
I promise.

45:30.559 --> 45:31.424
Let's go, man.

45:35.931 --> 45:39.925
What's a shaman doing
hanging out with a pastor?

45:59.421 --> 46:00.753
Pickpockets!

46:01.123 --> 46:04.719
Why should I believe
what you're saying?

46:04.893 --> 46:07.453
I know it's hard for you to believe

46:07.696 --> 46:08.994
but it's true.

46:09.598 --> 46:13.228
I wasn't stealing from him but
putting the wallet in his pocket.

46:13.535 --> 46:18.439
Okay, suppose you were
slipping it back in the pocket.

46:18.974 --> 46:22.411
If you found his wallet, why not
just return it to his face?

46:22.978 --> 46:24.913
What are you, a goddamn Santa Claus?

46:27.283 --> 46:29.582
We're very shy, okay?

46:31.420 --> 46:34.413
We're both Type A blood.

46:34.556 --> 46:39.094
You have quite a wrap sheet
for extremely shy men.

46:39.094 --> 46:40.426
Five counts each?

46:40.896 --> 46:42.330
Take a look at this, officer.

46:42.831 --> 46:46.199
They have over 20 counts of attempted crimes.

46:46.302 --> 46:47.201
Here.

46:47.970 --> 46:51.839
Theft, theft and special larceny.

46:52.374 --> 46:55.435
You've even got it down for
an attempted misdemeanor.

46:56.378 --> 46:59.181
You're quite something.
Book them.

46:59.181 --> 47:01.446
Sorry to interrupt but...

47:03.419 --> 47:05.149
I think you should let them go.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.753
What are you talking about?

47:07.489 --> 47:10.693
Whether they stole from us or not

47:10.693 --> 47:15.364
they repented and wanted
to return the wallet.

47:15.364 --> 47:16.764
How beautiful is that?

47:17.132 --> 47:19.158
You have an unusual idea of beauty.

47:19.635 --> 47:23.072
I see that you don't want
to press charges

47:23.072 --> 47:25.871
but we cannot release
since they were caught red-handed.

47:25.941 --> 47:26.909
Book them now.

47:26.909 --> 47:31.540
What kind of crime is slipping
a wallet back in the pocket?

47:46.495 --> 47:50.227
Thank you so much!
I'm happy that truth prevailed.

47:50.599 --> 47:52.761
You sound like you were
wrongfully accused.

47:53.235 --> 47:55.864
Is your mother in a serious condition?

47:56.672 --> 47:59.938
Your ancestors are looking over you.
It's not your fate to lose parents early.

48:02.244 --> 48:05.114
How gracious God is!

48:05.114 --> 48:08.684
He gave us everything
that we need for free.

48:08.684 --> 48:12.054
The sun, the water, the air,
animals and fruits...

48:12.054 --> 48:14.423
You should film this.

48:14.423 --> 48:15.624
- It's a fucking Beautiful moment.
- Despite that,

48:15.624 --> 48:20.324
if we say we need more, it's greed.

48:21.296 --> 48:22.664
God tells us,

48:22.664 --> 48:27.102
to sweat and work for those things.

48:27.736 --> 48:32.007
- God said all the wonderful things.
- you must work hard and sweat

48:32.007 --> 48:34.743
- you know?
- ...to pay for your mother's operation.

48:34.743 --> 48:37.646
- Regulate the family and rule the state.
- and, pray to God.

48:37.646 --> 48:41.917
He will help you, my brothers.

48:41.917 --> 48:45.877
I told you they're in good hands
of their ancestors spirits.

48:49.491 --> 48:50.686
Let's pray.

48:52.261 --> 48:55.798
Heavenly Father, these lambs
stand before you,

48:55.798 --> 48:58.767
- We're looking for someone.
- looking for someone.

48:58.767 --> 49:03.505
you must know the terminal so well.

49:03.505 --> 49:06.475
Can you help us put these posters up?

49:06.475 --> 49:10.435
Show them your great Grace,

49:11.246 --> 49:15.240
So that they can grow into good men...

49:17.886 --> 49:19.354
Are you sure about that?

49:21.356 --> 49:26.090
In our line of work, observing faces
is extremely important.

49:26.361 --> 49:27.090
Hello?

49:27.663 --> 49:30.155
The skill is crucial because

49:30.499 --> 49:35.494
you must avoid hitting
the same target twice.

49:38.974 --> 49:39.998
Kim!

49:45.681 --> 49:48.750
It's like a cliche.

49:48.750 --> 49:53.211
Spare some change for styrofoam.

49:53.388 --> 49:55.857
Then, this old lady goes,

49:57.226 --> 50:02.563
I'm stuck here because I don't
have the money for the bus.

50:03.031 --> 50:03.964
So,

50:04.633 --> 50:09.901
I gave her money for bus.
She wanted to go to Yeosu.

50:12.207 --> 50:14.733
Go on, go to Yeosu.

50:15.310 --> 50:17.506
I put the money in her hand.

50:18.113 --> 50:20.378
I even saw her off

50:22.117 --> 50:23.881
before turning away.

50:25.354 --> 50:28.085
Where did you find the money
to buy her bus ticket?

50:31.093 --> 50:34.063
Watch your tone, young man.

50:34.997 --> 50:38.798
Spare change for homeless shelter.

50:42.437 --> 50:43.803
You need money?

50:46.542 --> 50:47.669
Then,

50:51.380 --> 50:54.942
Why don't you sell this
for some hot meal?

51:16.638 --> 51:18.436
This is for your bus ticket.

51:20.442 --> 51:24.174
You really don't have to.

51:27.916 --> 51:29.908
Thank you so much.

51:31.587 --> 51:33.488
You're so kind.

51:35.223 --> 51:38.887
I don't know how to thank you.

51:44.566 --> 51:46.592
I want to go to Yeosu.

51:49.171 --> 51:53.404
Why Yeosu though?
Is it our father's hometown?

51:55.344 --> 51:57.210
Is Bethlehem Jesus' hometown?

51:57.346 --> 52:01.147
No, that's where he was born.
He grew up in Nazareth.

52:01.617 --> 52:06.555
You know the birth place and hometown
of a complete stranger

52:06.555 --> 52:08.319
but you don't know
your own father's hometown?

52:09.191 --> 52:11.285
He was born and raised in Masan.

52:11.627 --> 52:14.187
Then, perhaps he worked
on a fishing boat in Yeosu.

52:14.529 --> 52:19.058
Why would he go on a fishing boat?
The man never had a job.

52:19.334 --> 52:24.339
He spent all day in bars
and gambling joints.

52:24.339 --> 52:26.399
Mom always cried over it.

52:26.642 --> 52:30.579
I remember that.
Then, why did you do that?

52:30.579 --> 52:31.444
Do what?

52:31.913 --> 52:37.219
You said in the video that
our father died on a fishing boat.

52:37.219 --> 52:39.814
Do you know how confused
that made me?

52:40.255 --> 52:44.826
Should I have said that our dad
died riding a hooker instead?

52:44.826 --> 52:47.694
Well...

52:49.164 --> 52:50.496
Look!

52:52.467 --> 52:59.431
<i>Hope you find her</i>

53:04.146 --> 53:06.240
They're such weird brothers.

53:07.416 --> 53:09.715
It's hard for someone to be so
messed up unless they're possessed.

53:10.352 --> 53:11.445
Amen.

53:16.124 --> 53:18.423
Are you sure this is the right orphanage?

53:18.927 --> 53:20.555
We don't have that name here.

53:22.364 --> 53:27.564
Please look it up again.
He's nine.

53:28.904 --> 53:31.772
You just said he was seven.

53:32.641 --> 53:38.046
I have a seven year old and
a nine year old, too.

53:39.581 --> 53:46.511
I brought them here last year.
So, they must be ten and eight.

53:49.391 --> 53:54.329
I would know if you brought us
two grandsons.

53:57.466 --> 54:00.197
They're my sons, not grandsons.

54:08.343 --> 54:09.538
I see.

54:30.532 --> 54:34.469
We're almost in Mokpo. Can you take
the camera when we pass the gate?

54:42.711 --> 54:44.612
How do you want it?
Wide angle?

54:47.349 --> 54:47.983
A full shot.

54:47.983 --> 54:52.148
I could tilt up from
the navigation device like this.

54:53.555 --> 54:55.524
Is that you, Brother MacArthur?

54:56.525 --> 54:58.460
It's me, Jaryong from Yangju.

55:00.128 --> 55:02.962
Are you in Mokpo now?

55:04.699 --> 55:05.758
I just got here.

55:08.570 --> 55:09.503
No, not on business

55:11.039 --> 55:11.904
For a personal matter.

55:13.642 --> 55:16.311
I'll call you back.

55:16.311 --> 55:17.040
What's the matter?

55:20.015 --> 55:23.383
The temperature gauge was going up.

55:23.552 --> 55:25.817
I should've pulled up
at the rest stop.

55:26.822 --> 55:28.890
Meeting! You! Today! My! Ass!

55:28.890 --> 55:30.625
Why did it break down?

55:30.625 --> 55:32.457
I told you, you should change
the name of your damn show!

55:32.727 --> 55:34.423
Meeting who? Goddamn jokers!

55:48.076 --> 55:49.669
Welcome to Mokpo, my brother!

55:53.582 --> 55:57.018
I'm like a big brother to him.

55:57.018 --> 56:02.824
You can call me Brother MacArthur.

56:02.824 --> 56:07.963
You know General MacArthur
who spearheaded Operation Chromite?

56:07.963 --> 56:09.295
I serve his spirit.

56:09.464 --> 56:11.499
Old soldiers never die.

56:11.499 --> 56:13.935
They just fade away,
you know what I'm saying?

56:13.935 --> 56:16.504
You must know since
you're from America.

56:16.504 --> 56:17.972
I see.

56:46.868 --> 56:49.702
Well, then...

56:51.439 --> 56:55.877
When you talk to your guardian spirit,
do you use English?

56:56.544 --> 56:57.637
What are you talking about?

56:58.680 --> 56:59.875
I was just curious.

57:01.449 --> 57:07.355
I understand you talk to spirits
and since yours is a foreigner...

57:07.522 --> 57:10.617
His voice is dubbed.

57:11.226 --> 57:15.755
Usually, by the famous voice actor, Bae,
but sometime by someone else.

57:17.365 --> 57:18.128
It's dubbed.

57:34.382 --> 57:37.682
- I'm going to the restroom, too.
- See you in a bit.

57:40.822 --> 57:46.386
What the hell? Does he talk in Hebrew
when he talks to his Jesus?

57:47.162 --> 57:48.858
How rude of him...

57:52.400 --> 57:54.631
I have a question.

57:54.903 --> 57:57.839
How come you work here instead of Incheon?

57:57.839 --> 58:00.968
Because I'm on a mission activity!

58:01.242 --> 58:05.907
Should all Buddhist monks go to India,
instead of building damn temples here?

58:06.348 --> 58:07.649
You don't have to yell.

58:07.649 --> 58:09.284
I wasn't yelling.

58:09.284 --> 58:11.981
Damn it! I'm no art student.

58:12.954 --> 58:15.090
<i>Yeosu Bus Terminal</i>

58:15.090 --> 58:17.759
You'll see passengers get off
in just a moment.

58:17.759 --> 58:20.795
That's the one!
That old lady!

58:20.795 --> 58:21.888
She's a good looking woman.

58:22.097 --> 58:24.132
She walks away with other passengers.

58:24.132 --> 58:29.270
Here! The lobby!
Then, she appears again here.

58:29.270 --> 58:32.540
Then, she wanders around a little.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.907
Then, you see her again here!

58:37.379 --> 58:38.108
Huh?

58:39.948 --> 58:41.750
She leaves the terminal.

58:41.750 --> 58:43.718
- Damn it!
- Mom!

58:43.718 --> 58:45.710
Just make more photocopies.

58:47.088 --> 58:51.082
Why can't she stay put in one place?

58:52.961 --> 58:56.090
What's that bag in her hand?

58:57.665 --> 58:59.327
She didn't have anything.

59:00.702 --> 59:02.603
Oh, mother...

59:52.253 --> 59:53.346
Dear me...

59:56.391 --> 59:57.916
They're seven and nine?

59:59.194 --> 01:00:02.130
Eight and ten by now.

01:00:02.797 --> 01:00:07.502
How worried you must be

01:00:07.502 --> 01:00:11.166
after losing two grandsons!

01:00:12.207 --> 01:00:13.698
They're my sons.

01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:16.876
Pardon me?

01:00:18.446 --> 01:00:20.938
The boys are my sons.

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:25.787
I see.

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:32.350
You must've had them quite late.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.089
Is that biologically possible?

01:00:35.697 --> 01:00:37.962
Excuse me but can I ask
how old you are?

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:40.462
I'm thirty eight.

01:00:44.405 --> 01:00:45.270
Have some more.

01:00:57.685 --> 01:00:59.085
How kind...

01:01:16.604 --> 01:01:20.302
You should call register office
for that. This is police station.

01:01:20.675 --> 01:01:21.404
That's right.

01:01:22.443 --> 01:01:24.071
Don't people think before they dial?

01:01:24.479 --> 01:01:28.849
What was the other call about?
From Hope Orphanage?

01:01:29.117 --> 01:01:31.086
And, Hanuri Orphanage,

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:35.053
also from Grace Children's Center.

01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:37.918
What the hell is going on?

01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:42.297
Some crazy lady is going around
giving away money?

01:01:42.297 --> 01:01:43.932
How many places so far?

01:01:43.932 --> 01:01:45.366
Two, four, six, eight...

01:01:45.366 --> 01:01:47.569
Isn't it funny?

01:01:47.569 --> 01:01:51.606
She wasn't stealing from them
but was giving away money.

01:01:51.606 --> 01:01:52.941
Why report to the police?

01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:56.344
It's because of the envelope.

01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:59.314
The envelope was for condolence money.

01:02:00.982 --> 01:02:01.915
It can help ward off evil.

01:02:03.952 --> 01:02:04.681
Excuse me?

01:02:07.021 --> 01:02:09.684
Like in new year

01:02:10.558 --> 01:02:14.928
or when there is trouble in the family,
you paste thresholds with red bean soup

01:02:15.897 --> 01:02:18.093
or bury a chicken's head.

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:22.231
Sometimes, they distribute money
to ward off the evil spirit.

01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:25.870
Who would she pray to?

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:29.569
To Thousand Gods she serves.

01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:30.844
Thousand Gods?

01:02:31.913 --> 01:02:33.905
As in shamanism?

01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:38.353
Filthy shaman clowns!

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:40.221
They go around inciting old people

01:02:40.221 --> 01:02:44.659
leaving us to all the work
when our hands are already full.

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:47.754
Why make people distribute money?
So he can stand for election?

01:02:48.162 --> 01:02:50.393
Goddamn jokers!

01:02:51.866 --> 01:02:54.969
What are you here for anyway?

01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:57.572
We're looking for our mother.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:58.506
We were told she is in Yeosu.

01:02:58.506 --> 01:03:01.876
Another old lady!

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:05.580
Why are all the grannies
suddenly coming to this town?

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.276
The Expo has long ended.

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:10.852
Can this old lady...

01:03:10.852 --> 01:03:11.785
be the same one they're looking for?

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:16.457
She could be making
envelopes for money

01:03:16.457 --> 01:03:17.447
but not distributing them.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:21.858
Alright.
I can reach you on this number?

01:03:22.163 --> 01:03:23.859
That's the TV station.

01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:29.637
You can reach me directly on this number.

01:03:40.448 --> 01:03:42.110
<i>Shaman that everyone is talking about:
Brother Jaryong</i>

01:03:53.795 --> 01:03:55.463
Excuse me, I'm looking for...

01:03:55.463 --> 01:03:56.761
I'm not from here.

01:03:59.567 --> 01:04:01.160
Damn...

01:04:41.509 --> 01:04:42.704
Hi.

01:04:58.059 --> 01:04:59.925
Who did you come for?

01:05:01.929 --> 01:05:05.696
For my babies.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:07.799
Did you lose them?

01:05:09.237 --> 01:05:12.730
I just can't find them.
I'm sure they're here somewhere.

01:05:14.542 --> 01:05:19.207
When you miss someone,
you should close your eyes and pray.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.550
Can you see them if you do that?

01:05:23.418 --> 01:05:24.886
That's what I heard.

01:05:26.254 --> 01:05:28.450
I don't know how to pray.

01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:32.540
Give them to your friends, too.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:33.265
<i>Yeosu Bus Terminal</i>

01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:36.344
Have some seaweed rolls.

01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:37.812
Thank you.

01:08:38.345 --> 01:08:39.846
Over here.

01:08:39.846 --> 01:08:41.372
Have some.

01:08:42.617 --> 01:08:45.319
Thank you for helping us today.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:46.287
Thanks.

01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:52.421
This is all they had.

01:09:05.538 --> 01:09:08.202
Hymns are such wonderful things.

01:09:08.576 --> 01:09:12.308
How could beggars have
managed without them?

01:09:24.992 --> 01:09:27.086
Did you have supper?

01:09:31.732 --> 01:09:33.200
You should take this.

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:39.466
Where are your mom and dad?

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:45.703
Buy some food with this later.

01:09:47.715 --> 01:09:48.944
Go home.

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.576
Man, did I doze off?

01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:56.681
Do you think that money
will stay in her pocket?

01:09:56.991 --> 01:10:01.053
Stop doing random thugs
a favor and come back here.

01:10:02.096 --> 01:10:02.722
Eat the rolls, okay?

01:10:07.368 --> 01:10:08.495
What are you saying?

01:10:12.807 --> 01:10:15.436
Do you think she is begging
because she's hungry?

01:10:15.843 --> 01:10:17.277
She belongs to a company.

01:10:18.145 --> 01:10:22.344
She brings her earnings to her boss
to get food and shelter in return.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:25.551
You just did her boss a favor.

01:10:26.887 --> 01:10:29.690
Her expression, the pitiful voice...

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.556
It's a trained act.

01:10:31.992 --> 01:10:33.290
Watch what you're saying.

01:10:34.528 --> 01:10:36.463
Don't you see that she is struggling
to put food in her mouth?

01:10:37.531 --> 01:10:38.658
What do you know?

01:10:48.309 --> 01:10:50.676
You don't have a clue, do you?

01:10:51.545 --> 01:10:56.813
Poor little girl, take this money
and get hot food and shelter.

01:10:57.685 --> 01:11:04.216
I'm telling you because I know
what I'm talking about.

01:11:05.126 --> 01:11:06.992
Less than one week after
you left for America,

01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:10.029
I ran away from the orphanage
and came here.

01:11:10.131 --> 01:11:13.000
Do you know how many hymns I learned

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.631
and how many verses I memorized?
I can still recite them in my sleep.

01:11:17.705 --> 01:11:20.841
You have no idea because
you kissed your foreign parents' asses

01:11:20.841 --> 01:11:23.577
to take you to America.

01:11:23.577 --> 01:11:24.806
But I know!

01:11:26.714 --> 01:11:28.883
I know exactly how she will
turn around that corner,

01:11:28.883 --> 01:11:32.987
and run to her boss to get food
and a pat on her head.

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:34.546
in front of my eyes!

01:11:41.295 --> 01:11:42.354
Why did you come back?

01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:51.503
After 30 damn years...

01:11:52.473 --> 01:11:55.776
You should've just continued
your wonderful American life.

01:11:55.776 --> 01:11:57.802
What did you want from us?

01:12:00.447 --> 01:12:02.216
I missed you. I wanted to find you.

01:12:02.216 --> 01:12:06.720
What did you do in the 30 years?

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.279
Does it cost to write to your show?

01:12:11.759 --> 01:12:14.092
When it costs nothing,
why did you wait all these years

01:12:14.662 --> 01:12:18.997
and make me lose my mom again?

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:35.275
Not long after I was adopted

01:12:36.116 --> 01:12:42.522
my adopted brother and mother
were killed in an accident.

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:50.531
My father... my adopted father said

01:12:50.531 --> 01:12:52.898
that I brought misfortune into the family.

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:55.727
He called me a cursed little bastard.

01:12:58.138 --> 01:12:59.162
He...

01:13:01.742 --> 01:13:03.904
He became an alcoholic

01:13:04.812 --> 01:13:07.179
and subsequently became schizophrenic.

01:13:08.015 --> 01:13:10.177
I've lost everything because of you.

01:13:11.485 --> 01:13:12.384
My wife!

01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:14.180
My son!

01:13:15.623 --> 01:13:16.318
It's all over.

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.653
I'm over!

01:13:19.526 --> 01:13:22.189
You think everything's gonna
work out fine for you?

01:13:24.198 --> 01:13:26.600
I'm gonna kill you.
You little Korean bastard!

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.796
You hear me?

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.301
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:33.106
Did you take the injection well?

01:13:46.253 --> 01:13:47.653
How are you feeling today?

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:50.451
Yeah It should have hurt a lot

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.861
but you took it bravely.

01:13:57.765 --> 01:14:01.969
The police revealed that the person
who's been delivering

01:14:01.969 --> 01:14:05.098
mystery envelopes to orphanages
is an old woman in her sixties.

01:14:05.172 --> 01:14:09.209
Since two days ago, the old woman
has been distributing money,

01:14:09.209 --> 01:14:12.313
amount ranging from 200 dollars
to 1,000 dollars

01:14:12.313 --> 01:14:12.379
to children in several orphanages.

01:14:12.379 --> 01:14:14.610
My friends all want to see you Chris.

01:14:16.383 --> 01:14:17.851
I told them all about you.

01:14:18.552 --> 01:14:21.852
Your uncle really wants to see you.

01:14:23.691 --> 01:14:26.684
Of course. Next time, you'll be
able to come meet your uncle.

01:14:27.294 --> 01:14:32.198
You will be able to ride on an airplane,
eat delicious food here...

01:14:32.599 --> 01:14:35.536
The mystery elderly citizen distributed
envelopes containing 50 dollar bills...

01:14:35.536 --> 01:14:39.940
Names include Roh Sang-gu,
Hong Sang-cheol and...

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.909
God told me he will heal you.

01:14:41.909 --> 01:14:45.913
The police report revealed that
the names on the envelopes

01:14:45.913 --> 01:14:47.939
are those of Democratic congressmen.

01:14:56.423 --> 01:14:59.723
Can I get another soup to go?

01:15:09.036 --> 01:15:10.664
You get the check.

01:15:11.305 --> 01:15:13.240
I'll be smoking outside.

01:16:15.335 --> 01:16:17.861
I wish we find your mother here.

01:16:24.812 --> 01:16:26.804
Is there any hope for my nephew?

01:16:28.449 --> 01:16:29.144
Sorry?

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:33.881
You should make an appointment
for my test.

01:16:35.823 --> 01:16:39.123
It'll be fortunate
if I turn out to be a match.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.263
It's natural for a drowning man
to clutch at a straw.

01:16:48.068 --> 01:16:49.502
You can film us if you want.

01:16:52.606 --> 01:16:55.872
If my bone marrow turns out
to be a match,

01:16:57.144 --> 01:16:59.204
the pastor will cry his eyes out.

01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:06.617
If you can get that on camera,
it'll be a jackpot for ratings.

01:17:09.123 --> 01:17:14.426
You've never seen your brother's family,
not even from a picture, have you?

01:17:24.671 --> 01:17:29.837
Hey, it's the scumbags that
live off panhandlers.

01:17:46.059 --> 01:17:48.654
What did I say?

01:17:49.997 --> 01:17:51.932
That one's the boss.

01:17:53.934 --> 01:17:55.334
Let's hand in your
resignations tonight.

01:17:56.303 --> 01:17:57.134
Kids,

01:17:57.738 --> 01:18:01.140
run straight to the police station
and ask for help.

01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:03.136
If the officers say something

01:18:03.844 --> 01:18:05.938
bring them back here in their cruiser.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.780
Get the children out of here.

01:18:09.516 --> 01:18:10.449
What the heck?

01:18:14.154 --> 01:18:16.020
Who are you? A thug?

01:18:17.424 --> 01:18:18.414
A secret inspector?

01:18:19.026 --> 01:18:21.393
Did you suddenly feel like dying?

01:18:22.296 --> 01:18:26.461
I'm a national martial arts champion.

01:18:27.067 --> 01:18:28.399
What the heck is he on about?

01:18:33.974 --> 01:18:37.843
Your mother who died last year
didn't have a peaceful death.

01:18:38.745 --> 01:18:41.448
She clings on your shoulders

01:18:41.448 --> 01:18:46.819
begging you not to live like this.

01:18:48.322 --> 01:18:51.315
I think he knows about you.

01:18:51.925 --> 01:18:53.621
What the fuck?

01:18:59.433 --> 01:19:00.457
What are you saying?

01:19:01.535 --> 01:19:04.471
Do you have something to do
with my mom's death?

01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:05.906
Who sent you?

01:19:11.111 --> 01:19:14.377
Her head is crushed in.

01:19:14.748 --> 01:19:16.876
Was she hit by a car?

01:19:18.652 --> 01:19:21.986
Or did she jump off the balcony?

01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:27.688
I have several different mothers.

01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:32.229
I don't know which one
you're talking about!

01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:33.628
Oh my God!

01:19:55.289 --> 01:19:58.623
Help!

01:20:01.495 --> 01:20:02.986
Why are you doing this?

01:20:04.264 --> 01:20:06.566
Stop! What's going on here?

01:20:06.566 --> 01:20:08.001
Stop! Please!

01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:09.803
Wait!
You alright, man?

01:20:09.803 --> 01:20:12.034
What's going on here?

01:20:12.639 --> 01:20:14.733
Where did this loser come from?

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:18.174
Are you a martial arts master, too?

01:20:18.845 --> 01:20:21.838
I'm sure we can talk this out.

01:20:22.082 --> 01:20:22.742
Ha-yeon!

01:20:23.617 --> 01:20:25.381
Son of a bitch!

01:20:26.219 --> 01:20:27.380
Wait!

01:20:27.888 --> 01:20:29.254
You alright, man?

01:20:29.556 --> 01:20:30.455
Bro.

01:20:41.034 --> 01:20:42.093
What the hell?

01:20:43.937 --> 01:20:45.929
I look like my poor mother now.

01:20:47.674 --> 01:20:52.312
Like you said, she jumped off
a building and got hit by a car.

01:20:52.312 --> 01:20:53.871
I look just like my mom now.

01:20:55.182 --> 01:20:56.582
Let's talk this out.

01:20:56.817 --> 01:20:58.718
You little fuckers!

01:20:59.753 --> 01:21:00.743
Wait!

01:21:01.054 --> 01:21:01.851
Hey.

01:21:03.557 --> 01:21:06.083
You wanna die, is that it?

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.887
So, I became an orphan again.

01:22:06.887 --> 01:22:09.789
I had no place to go.

01:22:10.657 --> 01:22:15.322
So, I joined a Korean gang.

01:22:15.762 --> 01:22:20.967
And one day... by accident,

01:22:20.967 --> 01:22:23.801
I took a man's life.

01:22:23.937 --> 01:22:31.011
I killed an African-American man.
His name was John Keith.

01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:37.551
My attorney didn't mention
that I acted in self defense.

01:22:37.551 --> 01:22:39.386
So, the court didn't believe me.

01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:45.091
I was sentenced 15 years

01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:49.893
and served 7 years.

01:22:50.897 --> 01:22:56.461
My son is the child of the man I killed.

01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:09.140
<i>Emergency Room</i>

01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:38.505
What about this picture?

01:23:39.913 --> 01:23:41.905
Look at the name of your orphanage.

01:23:44.017 --> 01:23:47.044
It's called Jesurun.

01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:58.922
I can't believe this.

01:24:02.202 --> 01:24:04.330
Is that why she wanted
to go to Yeosu?

01:24:05.572 --> 01:24:06.301
Yes.

01:24:08.241 --> 01:24:09.334
Did they find her?

01:24:12.412 --> 01:24:15.211
I had enough. You eat it.

01:24:17.217 --> 01:24:17.980
You eat it.

01:24:22.956 --> 01:24:26.518
Look at him talk with his accent.

01:24:28.728 --> 01:24:29.855
Wake him up.

01:24:31.264 --> 01:24:32.197
Let's go.

01:24:35.769 --> 01:24:39.433
I can't believe she made us
go through all this trouble.

01:24:42.242 --> 01:24:46.543
Why couldn't they simply name
the place 'Masan Orphanage'?

01:24:47.447 --> 01:24:48.779
Why 'Jesurun'?

01:24:50.317 --> 01:24:54.812
It means 'God's beloved people.'

01:24:55.522 --> 01:24:56.353
Jesurun.

01:24:59.926 --> 01:25:01.952
I didn't ask you what it means.

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.869
Man, you are some fighter.

01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:23.476
Grabbing a blade with a bare hand.

01:25:24.451 --> 01:25:25.680
It was like a movie.

01:25:27.153 --> 01:25:32.592
My life was a mess after I left jail.

01:25:35.095 --> 01:25:41.729
I was ordained only 6 months ago.

01:25:46.039 --> 01:25:47.063
Only then...

01:25:51.544 --> 01:25:52.409
Only then was I able to...

01:25:58.218 --> 01:26:02.314
Why didn't you just come back
to Korea after what happened?

01:26:04.257 --> 01:26:07.694
Why did you stick it out there?

01:26:13.833 --> 01:26:17.031
I thought to myself in jail.

01:26:21.307 --> 01:26:24.869
Because it was me, not you,
who got adopted to America,

01:26:27.647 --> 01:26:31.209
you didn't have to go through
with this ordeal.

01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:35.153
I thought it was so fortunate.

01:26:36.723 --> 01:26:40.023
I prayed thanking God for that.

01:26:42.462 --> 01:26:45.364
That was my first prayer.

01:26:56.076 --> 01:26:58.773
She just woke up.

01:26:59.546 --> 01:27:03.745
She is very weak and needs rest.

01:27:04.517 --> 01:27:06.816
You must not strain her mentally.

01:27:08.288 --> 01:27:09.256
Let's go.

01:27:09.322 --> 01:27:10.221
Ha-yeon.

01:27:19.099 --> 01:27:20.089
How do you...

01:27:23.169 --> 01:27:27.539
What do you call her?
Mom or mother?

01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:33.308
Did you really talk about me sometimes?

01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:35.509
Mentioning my name and all?

01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:39.180
Are you worried

01:27:40.954 --> 01:27:42.547
that she might not recognize you?

01:27:52.098 --> 01:27:56.661
My heart never fluttered so much
to see my mother.

01:28:02.242 --> 01:28:05.041
It's not because
they found our mother

01:28:06.613 --> 01:28:10.880
but because I can take
my brother to her.

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:17.916
Will she recognize him?

01:28:57.764 --> 01:28:58.459
This

01:29:00.633 --> 01:29:01.794
is our mother.

01:30:06.132 --> 01:30:07.725
Did you have a fight again?

01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:13.804
You did, didn't you?

01:30:20.213 --> 01:30:22.239
How come you're always fighting?

01:30:27.153 --> 01:30:30.089
Look at your face, Ha-yeon.

01:30:32.091 --> 01:30:34.117
Did you come at your big brother again?

01:30:36.296 --> 01:30:37.059
It wasn't like that.

01:30:39.265 --> 01:30:45.466
He beat up some bullies
that were bothering me.

01:30:49.342 --> 01:30:50.173
Is that true?

01:31:02.088 --> 01:31:03.078
Come here.

01:31:06.826 --> 01:31:10.194
You're hurt.

01:31:11.097 --> 01:31:13.328
Look at your face.

01:31:18.771 --> 01:31:20.399
Are you sure you beat them up,
not the other way round?

01:31:23.409 --> 01:31:25.742
Your hands are like Jesus.

01:31:38.658 --> 01:31:39.591
You did good.

01:31:41.361 --> 01:31:44.388
You fought to protect your baby brother.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.236
I'm not gonna punish you for that.
Stop crying.

01:31:50.236 --> 01:31:51.938
Mom... mom...

01:31:51.938 --> 01:31:55.670
There, there. It's all alright.

01:31:55.908 --> 01:31:59.645
Mom... mom, mom...

01:31:59.645 --> 01:32:03.605
It's okay. Stop crying.

01:32:08.087 --> 01:32:09.646
It's okay.

01:32:45.391 --> 01:32:51.092
Some people suspect that
it was some kind of a gimmick

01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:54.599
but if we were motivated
by political agenda,

01:32:54.934 --> 01:32:57.995
we would've chosen nursing homes
where there are votes.

01:32:59.472 --> 01:33:04.240
In order for this not to be
a one-off gimmick,

01:33:05.144 --> 01:33:08.546
we wrote down our names

01:33:09.348 --> 01:33:13.046
as a sign of our determination
to support these orphanages to the end.

01:33:14.153 --> 01:33:17.590
What's the significance of the word
'Condolence' on the envelopes?

01:33:22.595 --> 01:33:23.756
Well...

01:33:25.098 --> 01:33:27.192
Condolence

01:33:28.634 --> 01:33:30.694
to the politics of this country.

01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:34.363
We pledge that we revive politics.

01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:37.768
Condolence!

01:33:39.745 --> 01:33:42.112
Condolence...

01:34:14.413 --> 01:34:20.250
Spring blossoms are abundant
but the rain won't stop.

01:34:20.553 --> 01:34:25.491
He tells me that you suffered so much.
You've been so lonely.

01:34:25.491 --> 01:34:29.262
You tried and tried to live but
no one recognized your effort.

01:34:29.262 --> 01:34:32.565
He tells me that you shed
so many lonely tears.

01:34:32.565 --> 01:34:35.134
He tells you to go back
and live your life again.

01:34:35.134 --> 01:34:37.603
There, there. Go now, child.

01:34:37.603 --> 01:34:41.641
He tells me that you should
not worry anymore.

01:34:41.641 --> 01:34:43.676
That he'll help you along the way.

01:34:43.676 --> 01:34:46.840
If you're still in doubt, come back.
I'll write you an amulet.

01:34:55.855 --> 01:35:00.691
I saw him off at the airport
and I'm heading back to office.

01:35:01.694 --> 01:35:04.391
I don't need to know where you are.

01:35:06.365 --> 01:35:09.199
What's with your connecting tone?

01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:10.602
What's that?

01:35:11.437 --> 01:35:15.306
The melody that your caller hears
while they're being connected.

01:35:15.808 --> 01:35:17.470
I think it's a different song.

01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:20.011
You should try calling your cell later.

01:35:20.179 --> 01:35:22.448
I'll do that now.

01:35:22.448 --> 01:35:24.350
- No, I mean later!
- Okay, bye.

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:26.581
But I'm talking to you.

01:35:44.370 --> 01:35:45.201
What the...?

01:35:46.339 --> 01:35:47.373
Damn you!

01:35:47.373 --> 01:35:51.477
No wonder I haven't been
getting requests for ritual.

01:35:51.477 --> 01:35:53.980
I'll make you pay, you annoying pastor.

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.505
Damn you.

01:36:59.945 --> 01:37:02.005
A song I remember from childhood?

01:37:02.415 --> 01:37:03.474
I'll have to think about that.

01:37:04.717 --> 01:37:05.650
Do you want me to sing it now?

01:37:08.321 --> 01:37:14.293
<i>The song about mom
the waves sang to me</i>

01:37:14.293 --> 01:37:20.366
<i>under the moon light</i>

01:37:20.366 --> 01:37:30.365
<i>Will she come home when the sun
comes up? I miss you, mom</i>

01:37:32.011 --> 01:37:42.010
<i>The song about mom
the wind sang to me</i>

01:37:44.156 --> 01:37:54.155
<i>Will she come home when the moon
comes up? I miss you, mom</i>

01:37:57.503 --> 01:37:59.472
It's been a long time
since I last sang this song.

01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:14.047
WE ARE BROTHERS

01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:19.692
I could tell from her accent

01:38:19.692 --> 01:38:22.595
that she wasn't from our town

01:38:22.595 --> 01:38:26.832
I thought she was filling
in for someone.

01:38:26.832 --> 01:38:28.698
It's quite unbelievable,
what happened.

01:38:29.135 --> 01:38:29.864
Like this.

01:38:31.937 --> 01:38:33.098
I mean...

01:38:33.539 --> 01:38:34.768
More like this.

01:38:34.907 --> 01:38:38.344
She was staring at cars

01:38:38.344 --> 01:38:40.973
passing at 100 mph on the expressway

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:45.317
waiting for the right moment
to cross to the other side.

01:38:45.317 --> 01:38:48.354
If I didn't pull up right there
and then

01:38:48.354 --> 01:38:50.448
she may no longer be with us.

01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:57.730
When people want us and need us...

01:38:57.730 --> 01:39:00.633
If you have an accident on
expressway, give us a call at

01:39:00.633 --> 01:39:04.670
xxx-xxxx-xxxx

01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:08.407
Our trucks will be there like
the wind.

01:39:08.407 --> 01:39:11.177
It happened once or twice in
my life.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:15.247
You know how many people
lost their jobs during

01:39:15.247 --> 01:39:17.450
the financial crisis.

01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:23.355
Many became homeless
and started the inquiry,

01:39:23.355 --> 01:39:30.262
how can we beat the cold
when sleeping in the street?

01:39:30.863 --> 01:39:35.100
One day, I came home from school

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.904
and found my mother
with bruised and puffy eyes.

01:39:38.904 --> 01:39:44.410
The eye lift she had never fully healed
even after 2 or 3 years.

01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:48.347
Her lashes almost touch her brows.

01:39:48.414 --> 01:39:50.440
Just imagine.

01:39:51.517 --> 01:39:54.316
She sleeps with her eyes open.

01:39:55.688 --> 01:39:58.591
My heart stops whenever I wake up
in the middle of the night

01:39:58.591 --> 01:40:00.617
and see her sleeping face.

01:40:01.494 --> 01:40:03.195
She's gone back to sleep.

01:40:03.195 --> 01:40:09.635
I would like to thank everyone
at the broadcasting station,

01:40:09.635 --> 01:40:15.040
the writer of the show, Miss Yang,
and my brother, of course...

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.209
I would like to give glory to God.

01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:18.609
Let us pray.

01:40:19.612 --> 01:40:21.981
Heavenly Father, thank you for...

01:40:21.981 --> 01:40:25.017
It seems that some people
are confused about

01:40:25.017 --> 01:40:28.888
what the difference is between
shamans and fortune-tellers.

01:40:28.888 --> 01:40:32.091
Whereas fortune-tellers speak from

01:40:32.091 --> 01:40:34.126
more vague feelings they get,

01:40:34.126 --> 01:40:38.063
us shamans communicate with spirits
through an official channel.

01:40:38.063 --> 01:40:42.134
We don't have the control over it.

01:40:42.134 --> 01:40:44.865
They don't come in
whenever we want them.

01:40:45.938 --> 01:40:49.975
<i>What is it like to be reunited
with your sons?</i>

01:40:49.975 --> 01:40:59.974
<i>Where are you now?
Are thoughts of me forgotten?</i>

01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:09.461
<i>Beautiful like a flower,
your lovely name was</i>

01:41:09.461 --> 01:41:14.767
<i>Sun-yi, O, Sun-yi</i>

01:41:14.767 --> 01:41:17.269
That's great, mom.

01:41:17.269 --> 01:41:24.343
<i>The waves are rising above the pier</i>

01:41:24.343 --> 01:41:30.442
<i>Our time that has passed
still remains in my heart</i>

01:41:30.849 --> 01:41:38.924
<i>Seagulls of Busan, O, Seagulls of Busan</i>

01:41:38.924 --> 01:41:45.489
<i>Deep down have you really forgotten me?</i>
