<i>I want a station at 30 mikes,

02:10.389 --> 02:11.632

02:14.928 --> 02:16.581
<i>Misfit Two One, this is Recon Three.</i>

02:16.701 --> 02:19.377
<i>Solid copy on checkin.
Stand by for sixline.</i>

02:26.833 --> 02:29.526
Have all the other drivers
fill up the fleet together.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.210
Check the air filter on that Humvee.

02:33.397 --> 02:35.364
Ampusel, grab me a donkey dick.

02:35.815 --> 02:38.101
- These damn runflats.
- Dirty Earl!

02:38.221 --> 02:41.369
I can fix anything from a screen door
to a broken heart.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.270
Trombley, did you eat?

02:45.094 --> 02:46.046
Yes, Sergeant.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.876
- You hydrated?
- Yes, Sergeant.

02:48.720 --> 02:50.920
- Have you defecated?
- No, Sergeant.

02:51.081 --> 02:53.537
- Fuck!
- Trombley, we have a long day ahead of us.

02:53.657 --> 02:56.634
I need you to take a dump now
before we get on the road.

02:56.796 --> 03:00.785
- Before you shit, hand me the bolt cutters.
- Outstanding job yesterday, gentlemen.

03:02.526 --> 03:04.534
Can I help you with something, Gunny?

03:04.654 --> 03:05.613
Sergeant,

03:06.005 --> 03:07.813
yesterday we had a trial by fire.

03:09.152 --> 03:12.035
I want you to know, Brad,
that I'm here for you and your men.

03:12.155 --> 03:12.656
Come on!

03:12.776 --> 03:15.737
Are there any combat stress reactions
anyone needs to talk about?

03:16.652 --> 03:17.547
Remember,

03:17.667 --> 03:19.782
I'm the certified
combat stress instructor.

03:19.965 --> 03:20.915
Fuck, fuck!

03:21.341 --> 03:22.535
It did it again.

03:23.402 --> 03:24.952
No, we're good, Gunny.

03:25.529 --> 03:26.665
But we would be  lot better

03:26.825 --> 03:29.344
if you were getting us
the gun lube and batteries we need.

03:29.464 --> 03:31.294
That might do it for my combat stress.

03:31.715 --> 03:32.965
Yeah, mine too!

03:34.714 --> 03:36.160
Dirty Earl, you up for worm dirt?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.909
Why didn't you do it first?

03:38.029 --> 03:41.219
- I don't know, Sarge.
- Rudy, you havn'tin't got no goddamn got any common sense.

03:41.339 --> 03:44.098
- I know, brother.
- Sgt, the spare caught a bullet too.

03:44.218 --> 03:46.630
- Fuck!
- Ready to kill, gunnery sir.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.270
Stay hard, James.

03:50.268 --> 03:54.241
That's where it's hanging up. I get off
maybe 10 rounds before it jams.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.325
This shit is totally ineffective
in these conditions.

03:58.445 --> 03:59.685
We need L.S.A.

04:00.515 --> 04:01.703
Lieutenant.

04:02.718 --> 04:06.068
Sir, the main weapon
on your point vehicle is unreliable.

04:06.341 --> 04:09.596
Given the prevailing climatic
conditions, using this lubricant

04:09.716 --> 04:13.711
is like trying to buttfuck a virgin
underaged phutak whore with chalk...

04:14.343 --> 04:16.089
when KY is clearly called for, sir.

04:18.403 --> 04:20.036
You'll have to deal with it, Sergeant.

04:20.156 --> 04:22.178
We have four more towns
to assault through today.

04:25.914 --> 04:28.117
You want logistics, join the army.

04:28.408 --> 04:29.658
Marines make do.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.774
Marines, I just want you to know,

04:33.935 --> 04:35.775
the company commander feels that it was our team

04:35.937 --> 04:38.069
that scored the touchdown yesterday
for Godfather.

04:41.332 --> 04:44.117
Of course Godfather's happy. He's trying
to get his full bird on our backs.

04:44.393 --> 04:46.244
At least I got to bust my cherry.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.338
My point is we gotta follow Godfather
wherever he leads,

04:49.458 --> 04:51.258
no matter how fucked up
it happens to be.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.020
- Sure do.
- Stafford,

04:54.501 --> 04:56.963
yesterday we ran the gauntlet
with no ass and no air,

04:57.559 --> 04:58.644
and for what?

04:59.373 --> 05:03.052
Fuckin' artillery blew the shit outta
that town after we rolled through it.

05:03.581 --> 05:05.138
We're reconnaissance Marines.

05:05.707 --> 05:06.962
Swift, silent and deadly.

05:07.709 --> 05:09.459
And Godfather knows this.

05:09.889 --> 05:12.303
And he knows when he sends us
into the shit, like yesterday,

05:12.423 --> 05:14.519
we'll probably come out on top.

05:15.519 --> 05:17.069
'cause we're the best.

05:19.289 --> 05:20.711
But that don't make it right.

05:21.686 --> 05:24.182
Beaver Hunter, why are you even here?

05:25.645 --> 05:29.644
I mean, After yesterday any cognizant person
with a speck of common sense

05:29.764 --> 05:32.339
would have caught the first truck south.

05:34.494 --> 05:35.410
Thanks.

05:37.915 --> 05:39.734
Yo, son, you shit on my shitter.

05:41.168 --> 05:43.125
Just wipe it off or something.

05:43.899 --> 05:47.199
Trombley, this shitter's
the only luxury I got out here!

05:51.327 --> 05:52.535
Screwby.

05:55.247 --> 05:57.491
Devil dog, your aim sucks.

05:59.123 --> 06:02.035
Pappy, if lance Corporal Trombley's
as good with his saw

06:02.155 --> 06:05.500
as he is with his shitter,
I think team one has issues.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.328
Is it correct to surmise
from your sitrep, sir,

06:10.489 --> 06:13.216
that we're gonna be rolling through
these towns with a lot of ass today?

06:13.336 --> 06:14.416
Yes, Captain.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.793
We got kudos directly
from General Mattis, I might add,

06:17.374 --> 06:19.962
for punching through yesterday
where R.C.T. 1 failed to go.

06:20.390 --> 06:23.123
But now it looks like we're back
to being one unit among many.

06:23.243 --> 06:26.793
And unfortunately, when we're rolling
with the regimental combat team,

06:26.913 --> 06:29.180
we can get lost
in the middle of all that ass.

06:29.551 --> 06:31.641
The only way
we're gonna get back into the game

06:31.925 --> 06:35.275
and score like we did yesterday
is to find another mission

06:35.395 --> 06:36.871
where we can break off.

06:36.991 --> 06:38.190
And, Captain Patterson,

06:38.570 --> 06:39.858
you can depend on Godfather

06:40.019 --> 06:42.527
to look for any opportunity
to get us back into the game.

06:42.688 --> 06:43.850
Count on it.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.259
Now, gentlemen,

06:45.911 --> 06:47.495
keep your powder dry.

06:52.473 --> 06:54.323
I have a present for you.

06:55.366 --> 06:56.166
L.S.A.

06:56.770 --> 06:59.188
Scammed some off the guys in R.C.T. 1.

06:59.489 --> 07:01.877
Sir, not to get homoerotic about this,

07:02.548 --> 07:04.184
but I could kiss ya.

07:05.803 --> 07:06.603
Walt!

07:09.971 --> 07:12.085
Get that mark19 properly lubed.

07:12.804 --> 07:15.854
Now we're talking
about killing some motherfuckers.

07:20.309 --> 07:23.716
Matt, hurry up and get off
the fucking dirt. We gotta go.

07:32.569 --> 07:34.856
This place gives me the creeps.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.624
Yeah, those guys waving at us

07:36.744 --> 07:40.094
are probably the same ones
who tried to kill us yesterday.

07:47.150 --> 07:48.355
Damn, homes.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.635
Hit with R.P.Gs

07:50.745 --> 07:52.431
Yeah, a buddy of mine in one seven

07:52.551 --> 07:55.584
had to fucking clean up a Humvee
that got hit like that.

07:55.704 --> 07:59.482
Said he found the driver's fingers
in the engine compartment.

08:00.558 --> 08:03.208
How did they know
they were the driver's fingers?

08:03.369 --> 08:06.235
'cause they were still gripping
the steering wheel, fucknuts.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.828
We oughta shoot some of these dogs.

08:17.682 --> 08:20.249
Trombley, I keep telling you
we don't shoot dogs.

08:20.681 --> 08:21.931
We shoot people.

08:22.371 --> 08:25.321
And we Generally only shoot people
if we have to.

08:27.998 --> 08:29.392
I'm afraid of dogs.

08:29.685 --> 08:30.843
You're afraid of dogs?

08:31.156 --> 08:33.011
What, Were you bitten in your formative years?

08:36.397 --> 08:37.857
My dad was once.

08:39.176 --> 08:40.562
The dog bit him

08:40.722 --> 08:43.048
and my dad jammed his hand
down the dog's throat,

08:43.168 --> 08:45.024
ripped up his fucking stomach.

08:47.982 --> 08:50.032
Where did we find this guy, man?

08:52.563 --> 08:53.631
I like cats.

09:30.610 --> 09:34.360
Remember how the kids would come
running out to us in Afghanistan?

09:34.930 --> 09:37.074
<i>- Yeah.
- Hitman, this is Hitman Two.</i>

09:37.194 --> 09:40.212
<i>Eyes on the village
confirms no enemy presence.</i>

09:40.658 --> 09:42.208
Captain America, brah.

09:43.244 --> 09:45.994
Winning the war
one souvenir at a time, right?

09:46.172 --> 09:47.016
Shit,

09:47.416 --> 09:49.089
- get that on video?
- Fuck yeah.

09:49.342 --> 09:50.973
Fucking scumbag, man.

09:52.878 --> 09:54.661
That's Bravo Three's commander.

09:59.957 --> 10:01.145
Check it out.

10:02.138 --> 10:03.088
Sergeant!

10:04.098 --> 10:06.179
For the life of me,
I could only find a black one.

10:06.299 --> 10:08.028
Have you located any red ones?

10:08.298 --> 10:09.148
No, sir.

10:10.551 --> 10:12.753
If you do,
you'll be sure to let me know?

10:12.873 --> 10:13.836
Yes, sir.

10:22.486 --> 10:23.994
P.F.C. Christeson,

10:24.941 --> 10:28.540
how far do you make it from the berm
to the edge of that hut?

10:31.552 --> 10:32.902
About 100 meters.

10:33.551 --> 10:34.351
120.

10:35.239 --> 10:36.089
Not bad.

10:38.175 --> 10:39.125
About 225.

10:40.052 --> 10:41.947
- See that beehiveshaped thing?
- Yeah.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.745
That's where they cook their bread.

10:43.865 --> 10:45.686
It's always gonna show hot in a thermal.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.339
It's all about the windows
and doors, man.

10:50.459 --> 10:51.985
Entrances and exits.

10:52.674 --> 10:53.524
Screwby.

10:54.864 --> 10:55.680
Brad?

10:55.800 --> 10:56.448
Yeah?

10:57.679 --> 10:58.629
I'm, uh...

11:00.865 --> 11:03.328
concerned about Captain America.

11:08.059 --> 11:09.419
Those guys are with R.C.T. 1.

11:09.579 --> 11:11.639
- Move, move, move!
- What the fuck?

11:13.407 --> 11:15.594
We don't have comms for that unit.

11:16.906 --> 11:18.912
Fuck, that's women and children.

11:19.032 --> 11:19.887
Cease fire!

11:22.235 --> 11:23.221
Cease fire!

11:24.219 --> 11:26.560
- Do not engage.
- Hold your fire, hold your fire!

11:30.972 --> 11:34.122
All Hitman Victors,
we've been observing this hamlet.

11:34.283 --> 11:36.153
It's only women and children.

11:36.315 --> 11:37.465
Do not engage.

11:38.109 --> 11:39.949
Sir, they're shooting
that hamlet in error!

11:41.463 --> 11:43.370
Sir, we don't have any comms
with R.C.T. 1

11:43.531 --> 11:45.300
and they're shooting
that hamlet in error!

11:45.420 --> 11:46.455
<i>Laser on.</i>

11:46.904 --> 11:47.997
<i>Spot.</i>

11:48.376 --> 11:50.885
<i>Range 71 is at heading 030.</i>

11:51.005 --> 11:52.155
<i>Link them up.</i>

11:52.439 --> 11:53.501
<i>Cleared hot.</i>

11:53.621 --> 11:55.132
<i>71, missile away.</i>

11:58.830 --> 12:01.129
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two two.</i>

12:01.252 --> 12:02.721
<i>Who cleared that helo hot?</i>

12:03.251 --> 12:06.242
<i>This is Hitman Two.
Nothing on our nets. Over.</i>

12:06.845 --> 12:07.882
<i>Interrogative:</i>

12:08.002 --> 12:11.189
<i>does anyone have positive I.D.
on enemy personnel there?</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:13.572
<i>Unaware at this time. Over.</i>

12:13.692 --> 12:16.142
<i>Range 71 is off left, addressing south.</i>

12:16.316 --> 12:17.866
<i>Standing by for B.D.A.</i>

12:18.706 --> 12:21.156
They fucking got good effect on target.

12:21.459 --> 12:24.785
<i>Range 71 copies.
Good effects, one building destroyed.</i>

12:30.895 --> 12:31.695
Dip?

12:32.832 --> 12:33.982
Yeah, thanks.

12:36.457 --> 12:37.471
Dawg,

12:38.121 --> 12:41.768
we was like, 13 or 14
and we were pedaling around

12:41.888 --> 12:44.757
in this neighborhood I grew up in,
just east of L.A.

12:45.023 --> 12:46.765
We saw some cholos from another hood.

12:47.831 --> 12:50.277
And we thought we was all
hard gangbanger wannabes.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.855
So we started saying, "Fuck off, yo!
"Fuck off,"

12:53.148 --> 12:55.946
throwing and flashing signs
to them and stuff.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.525
So they started throwing down on us.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.029
Kicking our little asses.

13:00.521 --> 13:03.287
Then some of the older dawgs
from our hood come out,

13:03.407 --> 13:06.285
grab those fools,
took one behind the tastee freez...

13:07.758 --> 13:09.705
They stabbed him up with a screwdriver.

13:11.275 --> 13:12.625
Killed the cholo.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.781
See, Generally white people,

13:16.652 --> 13:18.645
they don't drag a dude
behind the tastee freez

13:18.765 --> 13:20.925
and stab him to death
with a screwdriver.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.433
So after that day I decided.

13:24.424 --> 13:26.455
I'm gonna hang with white people.

13:27.538 --> 13:28.682
Well, here you are.

13:29.383 --> 13:30.142
Chaffin!

13:30.459 --> 13:31.409
Excuse me.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.362
Chaffin...

13:34.272 --> 13:36.440
Did you get a picture
of my girlfriend from Leon?

13:36.978 --> 13:37.983
I don't think so.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.569
Straight blonde hair, brown eyes?

13:41.796 --> 13:43.948
She have a big stain on her face?

13:47.323 --> 13:48.752
Haven't seen her.

13:50.956 --> 13:51.756
Poke!

14:00.642 --> 14:03.392
This town Ar Rifa
runs right up on the M.S.R.

14:03.512 --> 14:06.429
for two kliks.
Must be 75,000 people in it.

14:06.954 --> 14:09.236
Our mission is to haul ass past it.

14:09.543 --> 14:10.495
After that,

14:10.615 --> 14:12.056
what's next, sir?

14:12.305 --> 14:13.686
Haul ass through the next one,

14:13.806 --> 14:15.837
hope the Iraqis keep their heads down.

14:15.957 --> 14:17.314
Sir, in that last hamlet,

14:18.055 --> 14:19.609
all it took was one shot.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.112
That was just an undisciplined grunt
from R.C.T. One.

14:23.355 --> 14:25.322
Everybody opened up and
schwacked it over nothing.

14:27.392 --> 14:29.209
We could only keep
our own on it clean, dawg.

14:29.329 --> 14:32.037
What these other motherfuckers
do in this big wide A-O ain't on us.

14:32.395 --> 14:35.605
Yeah, it's hard enough just
keeping our own guys out of the shit.

14:35.725 --> 14:37.650
We can't e worrying
about the rest of the world.

14:37.770 --> 14:39.460
I know you all saw our own C.O.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.630
try to fire off a 203 round
in the middle of all that.

14:42.205 --> 14:44.211
- Fucking Encino man.
- But he missed though.

14:44.331 --> 14:47.181
- Badly.
- Look, Brad, can't live in the past.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.041
You need to snap to.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.399
We got a lot of shit ahead of us.

14:52.519 --> 14:53.769
Roger that, sir.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.590
Mount up!

15:17.492 --> 15:20.870
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
quick hold to Herringbone. Break.</i>

15:21.203 --> 15:22.630
<i>Hitman Three has fallen behind.</i>

15:23.598 --> 15:25.561
<i>Hitman Two, Two One Bravo set.</i>

15:26.377 --> 15:27.616
<i>Two Two, set.</i>

15:53.173 --> 15:54.478
How'd that line go?

15:54.598 --> 15:55.511
Q- Tip!

15:55.990 --> 15:56.752
What?

15:56.872 --> 15:59.122
Looks like Two men in black pajamas,

15:59.621 --> 16:01.733
creeping along at our nine o'clock.

16:01.853 --> 16:04.089
- 200 meters.
- Are they armed?

16:06.245 --> 16:07.311
I think so.

16:07.809 --> 16:09.252
Should I light them up?

16:09.372 --> 16:10.372
Yo, Gunny!

16:10.789 --> 16:13.001
Christeson's got two foot-mobiles,
maybe with weapons.

16:13.121 --> 16:14.306
200 meters to our 9 o'clock.

16:14.467 --> 16:17.294
If they got weapons,
light them the fuck up.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.904
<i>Hitman Two Three, this is Two One.</i>

16:26.024 --> 16:28.308
<i>Interrogative: what are we engaging?</i>

16:28.943 --> 16:31.268
<i>Hitman Two One, this is Two Three...</i>

16:32.006 --> 16:33.813
You're shooting too high.

16:37.259 --> 16:39.348
- There you go.
- Bravo Three is ready to push.

16:39.468 --> 16:40.907
We're Oscar Mike.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.321
- Let's go, guys.
- Bataillon is rolling.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.213
- Maintain suppressive fire.
- Let's go, let's go!

16:46.483 --> 16:47.484
Mount up!

16:48.454 --> 16:49.401
Go go go!

16:52.259 --> 16:54.111
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

16:54.231 --> 16:56.349
Our command Victor's made contact
with an R.P.G. team.

16:56.509 --> 16:58.634
We have engaged them. How copy?

17:00.231 --> 17:02.151
Let's go! We're Oscar Mike!

17:02.271 --> 17:03.301
Mount up!

17:04.452 --> 17:05.438
Go go!

17:10.098 --> 17:11.284
You know what?

17:11.404 --> 17:13.500
We were just fighting actual guerrillas.

17:13.619 --> 17:16.201
- Screwby!
- Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

17:16.362 --> 17:17.760
Do you copy? Over.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.515
<i>Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.</i>

17:27.635 --> 17:30.617
<i>We've suppressed an R.P.G. team.
How copy? Over.</i>

17:37.421 --> 17:39.502
<i>Hitman Actual, this is Assassin Actual.</i>

17:39.622 --> 17:43.172
<i>Be advised we are taking inaccurate fire
from the northeast.</i>

17:43.370 --> 17:46.690
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
Do you copy? Over.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.828
- Son of a bitch!
- Why are they stopping?

18:01.201 --> 18:01.999
Fuck.

18:11.740 --> 18:12.997
Why the fuck did you stop?

18:13.117 --> 18:15.462
Bravo Three got an order from Hitman.

18:15.582 --> 18:17.712
I didn't receive any such order.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.182
Sir, this is contrary to our S.O.P.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.726
We're bunched up in the open,

18:23.119 --> 18:25.437
and that town is definitely hostile.

18:25.557 --> 18:28.051
Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy?

18:29.190 --> 18:31.329
Damn it, Hitman's not on comms.

18:32.377 --> 18:35.459
Do you have any information, Sergeant?
Why aren't we in a defensive position?

18:35.579 --> 18:37.658
All I know is that Hitman
ordered my platoon to stop.

18:37.987 --> 18:39.409
This is his goat rodie.

18:39.935 --> 18:41.703
Jesus Christ, Nate! You're alive.

18:42.499 --> 18:44.130
Dave, what the fuck is going on?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.333
You were taken out by an R.P.G. team.

18:46.495 --> 18:47.860
Gunny Wynn's dead.

18:48.273 --> 18:49.696
If you need a ride, Nate,

18:49.816 --> 18:50.939
<i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

18:51.059 --> 18:54.170
We've stopped based on an erroneous
report. No One in Bravo Two was hit.

18:54.290 --> 18:55.819
Hell are we doing here?

18:55.939 --> 18:58.502
This is the type of Vietnam shit
gets a whole company wiped out.

18:58.622 --> 19:01.318
Sir, I'm worried that there are people
in that ville

19:01.438 --> 19:03.559
trying to organize a mass R.P.G. attack
against us.

19:03.883 --> 19:05.756
I think my concerns are reasonable.

19:05.876 --> 19:07.677
Sir, dDo you want us
to set up a sniper position?

19:07.797 --> 19:08.910
Nate? Nate?

19:09.437 --> 19:12.061
Sir, do you want us
to set up a sniper position?

19:12.181 --> 19:14.319
Push security out farther.
Let's make the best of this.

19:14.439 --> 19:16.995
- I'm gonna find the Captain.
- Punch out 20!

19:17.115 --> 19:20.281
- Leon, Christopher, punch out 20!
- Go go go go!

19:25.984 --> 19:28.412
I'm gonna call this one in right now.

19:28.989 --> 19:31.760
Sir, that's a cunt hair
over 200 meters, sir.

19:32.378 --> 19:34.528
That's danger-close for artillery.

19:35.984 --> 19:37.147
Danger-close?

19:42.693 --> 19:43.534
Sir,

19:44.125 --> 19:46.187
"danger-close" is an artillery strike

19:46.307 --> 19:48.812
within 600 meters
of a friendly position.

19:48.974 --> 19:50.324
That would be us.

19:50.624 --> 19:51.774
200 meters...

19:53.127 --> 19:55.577
That's pretty much on top of our heads.

20:00.646 --> 20:01.822
Dumb motherfucker, sir.

20:01.942 --> 20:03.994
Even the most boot-fucked marine
knows danger-close.

20:04.156 --> 20:06.269
- You're way outta line.
- Skipper!

20:06.389 --> 20:09.871
What the fuck is going on here?
You weren't on your comms!

20:10.092 --> 20:11.460
I'm calling in a fire mission.

20:13.188 --> 20:15.825
Sir, I don't like this. These two
get their fucking heads together

20:15.945 --> 20:17.598
it's fucking dangerous!

20:18.002 --> 20:19.539
It's the oldest play in the book...

20:19.659 --> 20:22.570
Officers calling in danger-close
fire missions to get medals.

20:22.690 --> 20:25.133
Lieutenant Fick, you need to square
these shitbirds away.

20:25.253 --> 20:26.767
You need to N.J.P. that man.

20:26.942 --> 20:29.392
Tell me exactly what you're doing.

20:29.566 --> 20:32.356
I'm calling in a fire mission
on a hunter-killer R.P.G. team.

20:32.518 --> 20:35.318
There is no R.P.G. team.
I called it in. My men destroyed it.

20:35.438 --> 20:38.005
Lieutenant, it doesn't matter
if we're right or wrong.

20:38.245 --> 20:40.009
You and your men can't disobey orders.

20:40.129 --> 20:42.593
An officer who does needs
to be relieved of his command!

20:42.713 --> 20:43.477
Sir,

20:43.597 --> 20:45.711
I'm merely trying to pass you
accurate information.

20:45.831 --> 20:48.163
There is no hunter-killer R.P.G. team.

20:51.317 --> 20:52.989
What is your order, sir?

20:53.853 --> 20:55.295
I'm calling in a fire mission...

20:55.872 --> 20:56.966
At Papa Quebec

20:57.125 --> 20:58.125
059...

20:58.662 --> 20:59.874
...098,

21:00.193 --> 21:01.565
038 degrees,

21:02.318 --> 21:03.388
200 meters.

21:03.840 --> 21:04.888
Aye, sir.

21:05.049 --> 21:06.902
Steel Rain, Steel Rain, this is Hitman.

21:07.022 --> 21:08.492
Fire mission. Over.

21:09.188 --> 21:11.654
Sir, should we dig in
for the fire mission?

21:11.774 --> 21:13.452
- There won't be a fire mission. - Grid Papa Quebec...

21:13.572 --> 21:15.745
Hitman's using the wrong protocols.

21:15.865 --> 21:16.712
What?

21:18.234 --> 21:20.183
Hitman has the grids
all designated wrong.

21:20.303 --> 21:22.192
There won't be a fire mission.

21:22.312 --> 21:23.657
There's a switch!

21:23.777 --> 21:26.851
For once our asses get saved
by sheer incompetence.

21:27.142 --> 21:27.959
<i>Out.</i>

21:33.935 --> 21:35.307
<i>Hitman, this is Steel Rain.</i>

21:35.427 --> 21:37.796
<i>Reconfirm grid zone designator.</i>

21:38.077 --> 21:40.304
<i>- What do you mean?
- Stand by, Hitman.</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:42.870
<i>Break break.
Assassin, this is Steel Rain.</i>

21:42.990 --> 21:44.560
<i>Your grid zone designators are OKcorrect.</i>

21:44.680 --> 21:47.222
<i>Message to observer: Papa Uniform 149...</i>

21:47.383 --> 21:48.916
<i>...213 Bravo,</i>

21:49.555 --> 21:51.810
<i>five gun one around.
H.E. delay in effect.</i>

21:51.930 --> 21:54.981
<i>Target number Juliet Echo November 1001.</i>

21:55.828 --> 21:57.486
<i>Splash in five seconds.</i>

21:58.832 --> 22:00.682
Five seconds to splashdown!

22:12.273 --> 22:14.916
- Sir, two hits...
- Suspected Ba'ath party headquarters.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.757
That's a lot of ordinance we just
dropped in the middle of a city.

22:22.236 --> 22:24.654
I'm worried about civilian casualties.

22:31.455 --> 22:33.714
Looks like Alpha hit something
with that.

22:33.834 --> 22:37.795
I guess It pays to have the right protocols
when you're calling in a fire mission.

22:52.117 --> 22:55.123
- I don't see any muzzle flashes.
- Why do we have to see them?

22:55.522 --> 22:56.833
Trombley, shut up.

22:58.295 --> 22:59.481
I got flashes!

22:59.751 --> 23:00.583
Where?

23:00.974 --> 23:02.173
200 meters,

23:02.333 --> 23:03.591
my 11 o'clock.

23:04.419 --> 23:07.902
Second story, white building
with the sandbags on the roof.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.602
- Two buildings behind the roadblock.
- Yeah, got it.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.342
His head's bobbing.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.603
- We're cleared to engage.
- Right on, right on!

23:24.957 --> 23:26.670
Die, fucker, die die!

23:34.407 --> 23:36.569
- Nice!
- It worked, it worked!

23:37.155 --> 23:38.167
Damn, sucker,

23:38.477 --> 23:39.980
I just got some.

23:40.207 --> 23:42.668
Look at me, Brad. I'm a man now.

23:43.102 --> 23:44.277
Just like you...

23:44.397 --> 23:47.175
Except I don't look like a faggot
and talk all educated.

23:52.718 --> 23:53.932
Watch your sectors.

24:02.477 --> 24:04.611
Most people in America right now
probably think of Iraq

24:04.731 --> 24:06.027
as a dangerous country.

24:06.394 --> 24:08.144
Now if I were to stand up,

24:08.518 --> 24:09.837
I might get killed.

24:09.957 --> 24:10.957
But to us,

24:11.216 --> 24:13.519
behind this wheel, it's pretty safe.

24:13.916 --> 24:14.961
So to us,

24:15.190 --> 24:17.483
Iraq is a safe country right here.

24:17.761 --> 24:20.119
I feel pretty safe. Do you feel safe?

24:23.394 --> 24:25.466
- Pretty safe, I guess.
- See?

24:25.661 --> 24:27.080
It's all relative.

24:35.915 --> 24:38.087
The natives are getting restless.

24:38.207 --> 24:39.716
Prayer is a good thing.

24:39.836 --> 24:42.527
Maybe it'll keep them too preoccupied
to shoot at us.

24:42.647 --> 24:46.597
Sir, the scuttlebutt I'm hearing
says you may be relieved of command.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.737
There could be an investigation.

24:49.566 --> 24:50.874
For trying to unfuck Hitman

24:50.994 --> 24:54.308
when he's about to drop arty
on his own fucking company?

24:54.571 --> 24:55.921
That's brilliant.

24:57.499 --> 25:01.474
Sir, your leadership is the only thing
I have absolute confidence in.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.361
I'm assured that I'll have the right
to address any allegations

25:04.481 --> 25:06.213
before anything is formalized.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.382
I'm assured of this.

25:09.851 --> 25:13.095
Sir, to highlight my growing lack
of confidence in the strategic plan,

25:14.100 --> 25:16.974
can you explain why we are
strong-pointing this hostile city

25:17.134 --> 25:19.277
in tin-plated Humvees while M-1 tanks,

25:19.397 --> 25:21.520
L.A.V.s and Amtracs roll past?

25:22.347 --> 25:24.946
Isn't it supposed to be
the other way around?

25:25.476 --> 25:27.706
I mean how exactly did this happen?

25:32.309 --> 25:34.476
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

25:35.111 --> 25:37.328
Make sure to Conserve your fire.
It's gonna be a long night.

25:40.244 --> 25:42.041
There's no plan for this, Pap.

25:42.201 --> 25:43.206
For what?

25:44.427 --> 25:46.897
Strong-pointing a walled town
with Humvees.

25:48.150 --> 25:50.624
It all feels so random...
What we're doing.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.261
Running here: shooting.

25:53.614 --> 25:55.179
Running there: bombing.

25:55.441 --> 25:57.826
That might be a legit target
burning over there,

25:57.946 --> 25:59.350
it might be a school, Pap.

26:00.628 --> 26:01.949
I hope it's legit.

26:04.361 --> 26:06.124
I hope this is good karma.

26:16.638 --> 26:18.411
Everything here is ancient, Pap.

26:20.039 --> 26:21.851
We're in an old old place.

26:24.199 --> 26:25.004
Yep.

26:30.542 --> 26:31.556
White flag.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.596
Could be some Habudabu trickster shit.

26:41.850 --> 26:42.843
Let's go.

26:48.334 --> 26:49.392
Help please.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.690
- Help.
- Movin' on!

26:51.810 --> 26:53.612
- Corpsman!
- Get the corpsman!

27:03.583 --> 27:05.291
Saddam... Fedayeen shoot.

27:05.884 --> 27:06.885
Not you.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.302
Saddam.

27:09.842 --> 27:11.380
You kill Ba'ath party...

27:11.830 --> 27:13.206
Saddam... very good.

27:13.326 --> 27:14.621
Saddam in our city

27:14.993 --> 27:16.537
shooting at you. Not us.

27:16.657 --> 27:17.672
We help...

27:17.990 --> 27:18.790
come.

27:18.910 --> 27:20.473
- I'll show you. Come.
- Okay.

27:20.742 --> 27:21.742
Captain!

27:22.732 --> 27:23.768
Call battalion.

27:24.502 --> 27:26.012
Battalion's on the net.

27:26.241 --> 27:27.521
Godfather wants to see you.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.736
Keep a handle on this till I get back.

27:34.856 --> 27:38.742
In Ar Rifa, this commander taught us
something about seizing the initiative.

27:39.168 --> 27:40.242
Earlier today,

27:40.402 --> 27:44.114
when his company came under attack
by fedayeen paramilitary forces,

27:44.317 --> 27:46.290
laying in ambush with R.P.Gs,

27:46.480 --> 27:47.917
he chose to stop

27:48.077 --> 27:49.849
and bring the fight to them.

27:50.497 --> 27:52.299
- Captain Patterson, greetings.
- Sir.

27:52.419 --> 27:53.815
I need the translator.

27:53.935 --> 27:56.266
We knocked out 	he Ba'ath headquarters.
We've n opportunity...

27:56.386 --> 27:58.844
There's a school of thought
that says we shouldn't have stopped,

27:59.004 --> 28:01.786
particularly given the proximity
to a hostile city.

28:02.331 --> 28:04.212
But this kind of aggressiveness

28:04.382 --> 28:05.516
is what I mean

28:05.803 --> 28:08.645
by interrupting the enemy's
own decision-making cycle.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.981
It's against all doctrine,

28:11.870 --> 28:14.193
but as the General often reminds me,
doctrine

28:14.550 --> 28:16.404
is the last refuge of the unimaginative.

28:17.541 --> 28:19.899
The fact is I just got off
the nets with chaos,

28:20.019 --> 28:22.410
and the General is impressed
with our initiative.

28:23.084 --> 28:24.988
We are on his radar screen.

28:25.722 --> 28:26.580
Gentlemen,

28:27.119 --> 28:28.916
we're coming out
from beneath all this ass

28:29.180 --> 28:31.138
and getting back into the game.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.003
And he's given us a tasker.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.931
This is the Qal'at Sukkar airfield.

28:39.291 --> 28:42.867
A British paratroop regiment
is staging to hit the field at dawn.

28:43.131 --> 28:44.757
The General has advised me

28:44.877 --> 28:46.571
that they are running late.

28:47.344 --> 28:48.645
And he suggested...

28:48.887 --> 28:49.979
If we're up for it.

28:50.442 --> 28:52.492
That we can get to the field first.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.590
To do this, we have to cross 40 kliks.

28:58.283 --> 28:59.822
Godfather needs an airfield.

29:00.773 --> 29:01.573
Sir?

29:02.111 --> 29:03.943
We've good intelligence from the locals

29:04.063 --> 29:06.100
on the Ba'athist and
Republican guard units in this town.

29:06.220 --> 29:07.277
We can exploit...

29:07.397 --> 29:10.665
No time. We're pulling out in 	he next hour.
See to it, gentlemen.

29:14.057 --> 29:15.833
All you find, we find.

29:21.128 --> 29:22.223
...together.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.057
Meesh, seriously, what's this guy
trying to tell me?

29:27.217 --> 29:28.726
Eeee, They are glad to be liberated.

29:29.738 --> 29:30.999
Okay, I got that.

29:31.198 --> 29:33.006
But What's he trying to tell me right now?

29:33.126 --> 29:35.953
They want to show us
the locations of the Republican guard,

29:36.073 --> 29:38.152
Ba'ath party and fedayeen forces.

29:39.522 --> 29:40.988
Maybe some weapon caches,

29:41.296 --> 29:43.741
- maybe even some chemical weapons.
- Okay then,

29:44.198 --> 29:45.709
it looks like we got our work cut out for us.

29:45.829 --> 29:47.235
Tell him	his man he's going to come with us.

29:47.355 --> 29:50.237
- Tell him I'm going to take him back...
- No, d-do... no.

29:50.836 --> 29:52.712
That's not how we're rolling, eh?

29:52.832 --> 29:54.734
We are pulling out of here soon.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.066
But rest assured,

29:56.186 --> 29:59.343
Godfather has a legit plan
to exploit the situation.

30:00.938 --> 30:01.739
We

30:02.153 --> 30:04.587
are going to give
these righteous people...

30:06.254 --> 30:07.500
I.R. chem-lights.

30:08.122 --> 30:10.726
They are going to set them up
where the bad guys are,

30:10.886 --> 30:12.853
nd mark them for the bombers who re going to bomb the shit

30:13.013 --> 30:14.623
out of whatever's marked.

30:15.177 --> 30:16.664
American Air Force.

30:18.871 --> 30:20.424
The best in the world.

30:21.874 --> 30:24.281
How do we know this guy isn't just going
to put it	hese chem-lights on the homes

30:24.441 --> 30:26.075
of people he owes money to?

30:26.235 --> 30:28.276
How do we know for sure
that he's even on our side, Meesh?

30:28.396 --> 30:31.830
How do we know nything unless we properlydebrief
these people and check their intel?

30:32.122 --> 30:32.990
Here.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.533
No thanks, Meesh.

30:38.147 --> 30:41.102
Okay, it's not the good shit,
but it's local brewed.

30:59.850 --> 31:03.142
You should write this down, reporter.
See, The war's actually not about pussy.

31:03.262 --> 31:07.232
It's about N.A.M.B.L.A. You know:
North American Man-Boy Love Association.

31:07.451 --> 31:10.503
See, Places like Thailand where they used
to fuck little boys and shit,

31:10.623 --> 31:11.996
they're drying up.

31:12.156 --> 31:15.040
We're opening up Iraq
for a whole new supply of kids, man.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.275
Ray, please!

31:16.953 --> 31:19.402
I'm trying to gauge the approach
to our target.

31:19.522 --> 31:20.406
Right!

31:20.526 --> 31:23.383
'cause we're gonna drive
40 kliks off-road

31:23.640 --> 31:24.571
in the dark

31:24.691 --> 31:28.393
to an airfield with Republican guard
on it by ourselves.

31:28.972 --> 31:31.223
And they say that I did
too much acid in high school.

31:32.006 --> 31:34.599
Christ, the business end
of Mattis's crack pipe

31:34.719 --> 31:36.270
must be hot to the fucking touch.

31:37.621 --> 31:40.232
- Brad, listen, there's no way...
- Get down!

31:40.392 --> 31:41.437
- Why?
- Get down!

31:41.557 --> 31:42.358
What?

31:46.611 --> 31:48.718
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

31:50.847 --> 31:52.186
Holy fuck!

31:52.423 --> 31:55.194
- Give me your headset.
- Why are we Iways hating on the mexicans?

31:55.314 --> 31:56.206
Who's up?

31:56.326 --> 31:57.666
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

31:58.067 --> 32:00.595
That is a friendly unit
northbound on the M.S.R.

32:00.715 --> 32:02.004
Firing on our position.

32:02.643 --> 32:04.932
I say again, that is blue-on-blue fire.

32:06.018 --> 32:08.430
They're northbound
toward Assassin's position.

32:08.550 --> 32:10.476
- How copy?
- Those are fucking reservists!

32:10.596 --> 32:13.020
<i>- I saw the markings.
- Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two. Copy.</i>

32:13.140 --> 32:14.262
You all right?

32:14.382 --> 32:16.603
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm fucking wet!

32:17.900 --> 32:19.279
Did you piss on me?

32:19.399 --> 32:21.904
Don't fucking tell me
I have reporter piss on me.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.902
Brad, they shot our fucking water cans.

32:25.062 --> 32:26.362
We're Oscar Mike.

32:27.659 --> 32:28.666
Damn it.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.731
40 kliks, no fucking water.

32:34.851 --> 32:36.703
Fuck it, at least you're dry.

32:39.565 --> 32:41.441
<i>All Victors, this is Godfather.</i>

32:41.632 --> 32:43.921
<i>Stand by, H&S has a truck down.</i>

32:44.255 --> 32:45.074
Stop.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.102
Start, stop, start, stop!

32:48.862 --> 32:49.713
Jesus!

32:50.248 --> 32:52.930
I'm beginning to think
Godfather's just a big cocktease.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.450
They shot a hole in our fucking tire.

33:05.919 --> 33:08.100
- You guys all right?
- That was some bullshit.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.121
- Trigger-happy reservists.
- Hey, Iceman.

33:10.241 --> 33:13.199
Can you believe those fucking reservists?
They just shot us up.

33:13.372 --> 33:14.803
It was shock trauma.

33:15.390 --> 33:16.954
Bunch of fucking doctors.

33:17.635 --> 33:21.375
Didn't they have to take an oath
or some shit against fucking people up?

33:21.595 --> 33:23.929
You need some security
while you do this.

33:24.417 --> 33:26.463
- I'll get with the Lt...
- Belay that, devil dog!

33:26.623 --> 33:28.327
Godfather's gots a mission,

33:28.684 --> 33:30.050
and that mission is now.

33:30.446 --> 33:33.147
Abandon this vehicle,
put your asses on another vehicle.

33:33.267 --> 33:34.638
- Let's get moving.
- But,

33:34.798 --> 33:36.384
- Sergeant...
- No buts!

33:36.557 --> 33:38.470
These asses ain't in gear
10 minutes ago,

33:38.590 --> 33:40.126
you's in direct disobedience

33:40.246 --> 33:43.215
of a direct order
from godfather hisself!

33:49.642 --> 33:51.613
- What are you carrying?
- Battalion's chow,

33:52.050 --> 33:53.165
M-16s,

33:53.594 --> 33:54.597
ammo,

33:55.579 --> 33:57.251
400 pounds of C-4,

33:57.371 --> 34:00.632
couple of cases of Claymore mines,
all kind of shit like that.

34:01.336 --> 34:02.342
Torklesen,

34:02.616 --> 34:05.704
get your bubbies in a running truck
and load up right now.

34:06.006 --> 34:06.864
You hear me?

34:08.896 --> 34:11.005
<i>Two One, this is Hitman Two.
Interrogative:</i>

34:11.125 --> 34:12.715
<i>where is the turn? Over.</i>

34:13.368 --> 34:15.027
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two One.</i>

34:15.148 --> 34:17.981
<i>It's coming right up. 100 meters. Over.</i>

34:18.435 --> 34:21.876
<i>Two One, it better be. I can assure you
that Godfather's watching.</i>

34:25.542 --> 34:27.757
Dude, I am so lost right now.

34:28.606 --> 34:31.542
Don't worry about it, buddy.
I know where we're going.

34:32.079 --> 34:34.521
We passed seven villages.
There's one more.

34:35.687 --> 34:36.487
Hey...

34:37.312 --> 34:40.188
Do you remember
the gay dog episode of "South park"?

34:40.356 --> 34:42.273
The one where Sparky runs away

34:42.393 --> 34:44.623
'cause he's humping
all those other dogs and shit?

34:46.257 --> 34:47.696
Yes, Ray, I...

34:48.846 --> 34:50.578
I do remember it very well.

34:52.632 --> 34:56.032
But I don't see what relevance
this has on our present status.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.055
There's the hamlet, our turn.

35:04.468 --> 35:06.215
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.607
We're making that turn now. Over.

35:09.222 --> 35:10.229
<i>Roger that.</i>

35:10.374 --> 35:11.587
<i>Nice job. Over.</i>

35:13.102 --> 35:14.115
Hey, Brad?

35:15.627 --> 35:17.318
Do your big gay Al for me.

35:21.238 --> 35:22.513
Come on, buddy!

35:22.791 --> 35:25.998
Do it for your old pal Ray,
the one who made the right turn.

35:27.961 --> 35:31.324
"Well, hello there, little pup.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.949
"I'm big gay Al.

35:34.831 --> 35:36.367
"Have you been outcast?"

35:37.382 --> 35:38.512
Fuck yeah.

35:38.673 --> 35:42.057
They had this gay bar open up
in the town where I'm from in Michigan,

35:42.177 --> 35:44.293
and people trashed it every night.

35:44.413 --> 35:46.373
They had to close it after a month.

35:46.493 --> 35:48.789
See, but there's money in that,
Trombley.

35:48.909 --> 35:51.848
Did I tell you I'm gonna open
my own gay bar when I get back home?

35:51.968 --> 35:54.951
It's gonna be called the golden stream.
And it's gonna be like this

35:55.071 --> 35:56.349
big urinal, right?

35:56.469 --> 36:00.266
And there's gonna be this two-way mirror
that everybody pisses against.

36:00.386 --> 36:02.571
That way when you're sitting
at the bar having drinks,

36:02.691 --> 36:05.956
there's like all these big fucking
giant cocks just pissing right at you.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.664
Corporal, are you a faggot?

36:07.909 --> 36:10.502
You know what?
I'm gonna franchise that shit.

36:11.427 --> 36:13.006
You can have Michigan, Trombley.

36:13.126 --> 36:15.568
Very lucrative territory,
homosexually speaking.

36:15.688 --> 36:17.301
That's not funny, Corporal Person.

36:17.461 --> 36:18.990
Ray, give it a rest.

36:19.641 --> 36:20.721
<i>Echo Five Charlie,</i>

36:20.881 --> 36:23.872
Echo Five Charlie,
this is Echo Five Echo.

36:23.992 --> 36:26.533
Interrogative:
how much further to the airfield?

36:26.653 --> 36:28.667
<i>Echo Five Echo, I don't copy.</i>

36:31.141 --> 36:32.024
Sergeant?

36:32.536 --> 36:35.024
- What?
- I just lost my helmet.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.050
What do you want to do, hold a funeral?

36:37.170 --> 36:40.020
- Sergeant?
- We ain't going back for it, Gabe.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.287
Get me General Mattis.

37:34.698 --> 37:36.420
Chaos actual, this is Godfather.

37:36.581 --> 37:38.423
Stand by for traffic. Over.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.364
Roger. Send traffic. Over.

37:40.484 --> 37:41.927
Sir, we got Chaos on the net.

37:44.738 --> 37:46.542
Chaos, this is Godfather.

37:46.662 --> 37:49.072
Teams are out now
getting eyes on the field. Break.

37:49.192 --> 37:52.187
We'll have complete sit-rep for you
within five mikes. How copy? Over.

37:53.130 --> 37:55.376
- Solid copy.
- Roger that. Out.

37:56.662 --> 37:58.065
Chaos is waiting.

37:58.185 --> 37:59.319
Brits are in the air.

38:00.079 --> 38:02.155
But our u-2 surveillance
picked up four possible

38:02.315 --> 38:04.512
t-72 tanks on the iraqi field.

38:05.193 --> 38:08.829
If our eyes affirm this intel, Chaos
needs to abort the british assault.

38:09.990 --> 38:12.247
They hit the point of no return
in under 30 mikes.

38:12.367 --> 38:15.044
So where the fuck are my eyes
on that field?

38:16.454 --> 38:19.502
Assassin actual,
Godfather needs your sit-rep asap. Over.

38:19.622 --> 38:21.133
Roger that. Stand by.

38:21.580 --> 38:24.912
Assassin Two Three,
this is Assassin actual. How copy?

38:27.965 --> 38:30.274
Assassin, this is Assassin Two Three.

38:30.509 --> 38:33.045
We are one klik out.
40 mikes from objective.

38:33.294 --> 38:35.907
I say again, 4-0 mikes. Over.

38:36.515 --> 38:37.427
Roger.

38:39.542 --> 38:42.154
Alpha is 40 mikes away
from getting eyes on the field.

38:43.862 --> 38:45.742
These guys have bitched and moaned,

38:45.862 --> 38:49.845
moaned and bitched that I haven't
given them a legitimate recon mission.

38:49.965 --> 38:53.040
I finally give them one,
and they fucking fail me.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.131
We don't have that option.

38:59.251 --> 39:00.505
We will recon that field.

39:01.025 --> 39:02.799
We will recon it in force.

39:02.999 --> 39:06.549
I want the entire battalion Oscar Mike
inside of 10 minutes.

39:11.624 --> 39:12.429
Sir,

39:13.251 --> 39:15.252
that's not a reconnaissance mission.

39:15.372 --> 39:17.522
- That's an assault.
- Semantics.

39:19.043 --> 39:20.675
What about the T-72s?

39:21.004 --> 39:23.704
The violence of action
is to our advantage.

39:23.902 --> 39:27.283
I'll request that division
adjust the R.O.E. accordingly.

39:30.005 --> 39:30.993
Roger that, sir.

39:34.244 --> 39:35.941
Assassin Actual, this is Godfather.

39:36.061 --> 39:37.872
Abort that mission. R.T.B.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.816
<i>Interrogative:
you want me to return to base?</i>

39:40.936 --> 39:41.986
Affirmative.

39:47.849 --> 39:50.085
<i>All Hitman Two Gunners be advised.</i>

39:50.913 --> 39:54.283
<i>Alpha has a team
reentering friendly lines to the north.</i>

39:54.870 --> 39:55.870
<i>How copy?</i>

39:58.028 --> 39:58.803
Brad?

40:01.498 --> 40:02.948
Get your team ready.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.740
We're assaulting the airfield.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.395
Less than 10 mikes.

40:09.025 --> 40:09.952
Wake up.

40:10.072 --> 40:12.451
Walt, range the Mark-19 as far out

40:12.612 --> 40:15.204
as you feel comfortable
engaging targets with good effect.

40:16.059 --> 40:17.630
What about Alpha's recon?

40:17.750 --> 40:19.189
They're out of time.

40:19.309 --> 40:20.668
- I'm up.
- They fucked it.

40:20.993 --> 40:22.711
We're going up against tanks.

40:24.168 --> 40:26.220
Grab a diesel. Let's mount up.

40:26.642 --> 40:28.336
It's on race. Two Two's up.

40:28.456 --> 40:30.631
Yo, man,
if you have to do number one, go now,

40:30.751 --> 40:32.834
because once I start the car,
I am not stopping.

40:32.954 --> 40:34.129
Naked Marine,

40:34.249 --> 40:36.392
- the Internet loves you!
- Fuck you, Person.

40:36.553 --> 40:39.750
- Get your ass back in the vehicle.
- Where's Lilley?

40:40.998 --> 40:42.548
We're Oscar Mike, man.

40:42.732 --> 40:43.670
Move it.

40:44.260 --> 40:46.862
- You really are gay, aren't you?
- Brah I'm not cool.

41:05.025 --> 41:06.141
<i>This is Godfather.</i>

41:06.261 --> 41:08.709
<i>Godfather Actual
has declared all Iraqis hostile</i>

41:08.829 --> 41:11.749
<i>in proximity to the objective.
How copy? Over.</i>

41:11.869 --> 41:13.565
Affirmative. Copy that.

41:14.483 --> 41:16.498
Godfather just changed
the rules of engagement.

41:16.618 --> 41:18.168
He's lowered the bar.

41:19.554 --> 41:21.404
Shit, he's removed the bar.

41:22.193 --> 41:26.143
New R.O.E. has all Iraqis on or near
that airfield declared hostile.

41:26.823 --> 41:27.819
A free-fire zone?

41:29.621 --> 41:31.155
I'm not passing that word.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.866
Keep this change in the R.O.E.
off our net.

41:40.795 --> 41:42.628
Got any comms with those A-10s?

41:42.748 --> 41:43.698
Negative.

41:44.162 --> 41:46.312
Those jets are goddamn Air Force.

41:46.524 --> 41:47.838
They shoot marines.

41:48.451 --> 41:49.857
You know, That map showed fences.

41:49.977 --> 41:51.942
If there's fences,
we'e gonnall need the bolt cutters.

41:52.062 --> 41:53.543
They're under the reporter's seat.

41:53.663 --> 41:56.829
Hey,Can you lift your ass in a hurry
if we need to get to those bolt cutters?

41:56.949 --> 41:57.968
I think so.

42:04.099 --> 42:06.732
You have to get out of the Humvee
to open it.

42:06.893 --> 42:09.153
- I don't see a fence anyway.
- Do you need them now?

42:09.273 --> 42:10.946
Charlie just cleared a guard tower.

42:13.068 --> 42:15.167
- What is it, walt?
- Fucking shit!

42:15.287 --> 42:16.637
Mark-19's jammed.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.585
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

42:20.060 --> 42:21.475
Our mark-19 is down.

42:21.758 --> 42:23.458
I say again, our main gun is down.

42:23.618 --> 42:24.368
Shit!

42:24.744 --> 42:26.961
Either unfuck it now
or get on your fucking saw.

42:27.122 --> 42:28.045
I'm trying.

42:28.206 --> 42:30.298
I see men running,
200 meters, 10 o'clock.

42:30.458 --> 42:31.925
- Are they Armed?
- They're something.

42:32.085 --> 42:34.947
Well, the order is
everyone is declared hostile.

42:35.067 --> 42:36.221
Light 'em the fuck up.

42:40.752 --> 42:42.769
Oh, Shooting motherfuckers like it's cool.

42:45.831 --> 42:46.564
Fuck!

42:50.680 --> 42:52.631
<i>All right, gents,
keep your heads on a swivel.</i>

42:52.751 --> 42:54.501
<i>Maintain your dispersion.</i>

43:03.353 --> 43:05.103
<i>Everybody stay on a line.</i>

43:22.802 --> 43:25.513
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
maintain dispersion.</i>

43:25.633 --> 43:28.148
<i>Target building 500 meters ahead. Break.</i>

43:28.308 --> 43:30.626
<i>Hitman Three is holding our flank. Over.</i>

43:30.746 --> 43:32.444
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two One.</i>

43:32.604 --> 43:35.258
<i>Have two tanks, northwest side
of the warehouse. Over.</i>

43:35.378 --> 43:37.324
<i>This is Hitman Two. Affirmative.</i>

43:37.484 --> 43:39.993
<i>They appear to be stationary.
No personnel.</i>

43:40.349 --> 43:42.318
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Three.</i>

43:42.438 --> 43:45.438
<i>I have an unmanned Z.P.U.-57 Tac-2.</i>

43:45.558 --> 43:47.250
<i>Appears to be abandoned. Over.</i>

43:47.410 --> 43:49.199
<i>Two Three, this is Two. Copy that.</i>

43:49.319 --> 43:50.920
He's got his fucking bayonet out.

43:52.587 --> 43:55.191
- Doing his Rambo.
- Follow my tracers!

43:55.376 --> 43:56.926
He's shooting at scraps of metal.

44:00.131 --> 44:03.395
Can you believe that fucking retard
is in charge of people?

44:03.515 --> 44:04.624
Jesus Christ.

44:08.865 --> 44:10.190
Engage those buildings!

44:10.874 --> 44:12.859
Sir, that's more than 3,000 meters away.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.527
Range of my fifty is 1830.

44:15.681 --> 44:17.067
Move into position.

44:17.187 --> 44:18.323
Engage! Engage!

44:24.614 --> 44:26.043
Should I light them up?

44:26.163 --> 44:26.863
No.

44:27.357 --> 44:28.807
We're not engaging.

44:29.144 --> 44:31.138
Those aren't military buildings.

44:31.258 --> 44:32.808
They're civilian huts.

44:40.617 --> 44:41.367
Yeah,

44:42.283 --> 44:45.554
looks like Saddam's big bad
republican guard hajis

44:45.674 --> 44:46.976
got wind I was coming.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.585
As the great warrior-poet
Ice Cube once said,

44:50.901 --> 44:53.189
"If the day does not require an A.K.,

44:53.309 --> 44:54.459
"it is good. "

44:55.236 --> 44:57.292
They stick around and man those,
we'd have been dead

44:57.412 --> 44:58.832
before we even saw them.

44:58.952 --> 45:01.323
- Take a picture of me...
- Dude, lighten up.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.504
Then again the world wouldn't have
to deal with the prospect of you

45:07.624 --> 45:10.319
returning to your cretinous
daughter-fucking trailer-park

45:10.439 --> 45:12.662
red-state shithole,
and producing mutant,

45:12.782 --> 45:16.297
whiskey tango, scrotum-faced,
bucktoothed, zit-exploding progeny.

45:16.417 --> 45:17.194
Heads up.

45:19.093 --> 45:20.635
I need a channel to division main.

45:24.228 --> 45:26.578
Lance Corporal Trombley, channel five.

45:28.295 --> 45:28.995
Sir.

45:31.124 --> 45:32.819
Chaos, this is godfather.

45:32.939 --> 45:33.694
<i>Send it.</i>

45:33.814 --> 45:36.664
Be advised.
We have seized the enemy airfield.

45:37.245 --> 45:38.668
Early reports are

45:38.788 --> 45:40.905
we've captured several enemy tanks

45:41.065 --> 45:42.696
and self-propelled triple-a batteries.

45:42.816 --> 45:43.616
It appears

45:44.005 --> 45:47.988
that we've overrun the entire
255th mechanized regiment who have fled.

45:48.565 --> 45:49.515
And sir,

45:49.706 --> 45:51.756
we've sustained zero casualties.

45:52.084 --> 45:53.134
<i>Outstanding.</i>

45:53.377 --> 45:54.327
Thank you.

45:54.491 --> 45:55.741
Roger that. Out.

46:01.285 --> 46:03.444
- Is that the british paratroopers?
- No.

46:03.564 --> 46:06.442
We scrubbed their mission.
We got here first.

46:09.139 --> 46:10.089
Gentlemen.

46:12.008 --> 46:13.438
We just seized an airfield.

46:16.625 --> 46:18.575
That was pretty fucking ninja.

46:24.838 --> 46:26.340
Just keep it dry, eh?

46:26.460 --> 46:29.230
I know they're heinous, bro.
I'm living in it.

46:29.350 --> 46:31.014
- Holy fuck.
- Jesus!

46:31.134 --> 46:32.985
- That feels good.
- Smells like dick juice.

46:33.105 --> 46:35.543
When's the last time
you took your boot off and gave your paw some air?

46:35.703 --> 46:38.565
- Come on, doc,give it a rest.
- You know we can't.

46:38.685 --> 46:40.708
They ordered us to sleep
in the damn things.

46:40.828 --> 46:42.252
Got some good news...

46:42.860 --> 46:44.464
We're so far ahead of R.C.T. 1,

46:44.584 --> 46:46.845
we'll be here a good 24 hours
before they show up.

46:47.007 --> 46:49.800
However, there is a bit of concern
in some quarters about being overrun,

46:49.920 --> 46:51.969
since we don't eally know
what's around us out here,

46:52.089 --> 46:55.104
so make sure you maintain 50% watch
and the comms are good.

46:55.264 --> 46:57.829
We got pre-register on-call
artillery if we want it.

46:57.949 --> 47:00.810
Sir, has any thought been given
to destroying the weapons

47:00.930 --> 47:03.580
and ordinance
that are sitting over there?

47:05.089 --> 47:06.907
Actually that did come up.

47:07.777 --> 47:10.620
But it seems the battalion's supply
of C-4 is now unaccounted for.

47:11.234 --> 47:13.164
The battalion supply truck
we left last night,

47:13.719 --> 47:16.814
it is a smoldering heap
of twisted metal and failed hopes

47:16.934 --> 47:20.212
in the trustworthiness of the iraqis
we are striving so hard to liberate.

47:21.484 --> 47:22.965
What does that mean, sir?

47:24.775 --> 47:26.956
It means we're on one meal a day.

47:33.122 --> 47:35.857
I'm just saying
I'm surprised is all, Brad.

47:35.977 --> 47:38.553
- I mean, aren't you surprised?
- Shut the fuck up.

47:38.673 --> 47:40.919
I mean, I'm betting

47:41.039 --> 47:44.207
that they were thinking...
That they could just, you know,

47:44.575 --> 47:47.790
leave a fully-loaded
supply truck laying around.

47:48.276 --> 47:50.391
Just like you could anywhere
in american, you know.

47:50.511 --> 47:53.121
I mean, you park your unlocked car

47:53.810 --> 47:55.540
in Detroit or Baltimore, I mean,

47:56.010 --> 47:58.501
your shit's gonna be there
guaranteed when you get back

47:58.661 --> 48:01.212
from the day spa with your skin
all exfoliated and shit, right?

48:02.623 --> 48:04.591
I meanseriously, homes,

48:05.006 --> 48:07.706
why would our Iraqi brethren

48:07.826 --> 48:09.637
want 400 Ibs

48:10.263 --> 48:14.262
of C-4, claymores and crates of M-16s?
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

48:15.355 --> 48:16.242
Wait!

48:16.362 --> 48:18.938
/You knowThey could be using
all that C-4 for, like,

48:19.618 --> 48:22.185
a giant 4th of july celebration.

48:22.512 --> 48:23.567
What do you think,Brad?

48:23.775 --> 48:26.445
I think it's time for
you to shut the fuck up.

48:26.606 --> 48:29.255
Nice job shooting those camels,
Trombley.

48:29.925 --> 48:32.200
I think I shot one of those Iraqis too.

48:32.431 --> 48:33.741
I saw him fall.

48:33.861 --> 48:36.122
- All we saw was camels going down.
- Camel killer.

48:38.855 --> 48:41.931
Look, I didn't mean
to shoot innocent camels, all right?

48:42.051 --> 48:43.701
I'm sure I shot people.

48:45.045 --> 48:47.634
Shouldn't you two be doing
the after-action report on Alpha's

48:47.954 --> 48:49.552
failedrecon mission?

49:07.221 --> 49:09.852
What's this about
you losing your kevlar?

49:10.516 --> 49:13.500
It bounced off my head,
Sergeant Major, last night.

49:13.863 --> 49:14.997
Bounced off your head?

49:15.117 --> 49:17.913
I was up on the fifty cal and the Humvee
went over a berm, Sergeant Major.

49:18.074 --> 49:19.791
That kevlar wasn't yours to lose!

49:21.221 --> 49:24.504
That was the property of
this united states Marine corps!

49:25.539 --> 49:26.922
It belonged to every Marine!

49:28.026 --> 49:30.468
'cause of your failure
to secure that helmet

49:30.949 --> 49:33.840
you've jeopardized
every Marine serving today.

49:36.426 --> 49:38.776
I was considering N.J.P.Ing your ass.

49:39.470 --> 49:40.769
Sergeant Colbert!

49:41.298 --> 49:43.855
This is what happens when you
don't enforce the grooming standards.

49:44.492 --> 49:46.526
The mens gets all lax

49:46.686 --> 49:48.745
and then other standards fall.

49:49.685 --> 49:52.823
Devil dog here stops using
his chinstrap, goes over a bump,

49:52.943 --> 49:54.908
kevlar goes flying off his head,

49:55.587 --> 49:57.369
and our protective posture...

49:57.990 --> 49:59.102
is weakened.

50:00.249 --> 50:01.832
Roger that, Sergeant Major.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.424
I'm not the fucking retard
who lost a whole supply truck.

50:14.755 --> 50:17.390
Gimme any target,
I'll hit anything out to 700 yards.

50:18.932 --> 50:20.616
What are they dragging?

50:20.934 --> 50:22.588
Think they want something?

50:22.708 --> 50:25.377
One humanitarian ration
for two blowjobs.

50:25.497 --> 50:28.447
That's the going rate
in this part of the world.

50:31.110 --> 50:32.832
Stiney, give me a hand.

50:44.862 --> 50:45.707
Stop.

50:53.739 --> 50:54.934
Hey, buddy,

50:55.315 --> 50:56.565
can you hear me?

50:57.394 --> 50:58.188
Good.

51:12.045 --> 51:13.820
The kid's been zipped with 556.

51:15.763 --> 51:16.948
Marines shot this kid.

51:18.937 --> 51:20.546
Fucking jackasses.

51:21.748 --> 51:23.330
Trigger-happy motherfucker.

51:23.492 --> 51:25.708
- Doc, is there anything I can do?
- Yeah,

51:26.054 --> 51:28.081
Stiney, get me the battalion surgeon.

51:28.201 --> 51:30.774
We need to cas-evac
this kid or he's dead.

51:30.894 --> 51:31.974
Done.

51:34.769 --> 51:37.803
Christeson, Stafford,
two stretchers to doc, 12 o'clock.

51:41.147 --> 51:42.837
You're a very brave kid.

51:45.305 --> 51:47.155
He's very strong, all right?

51:49.238 --> 51:50.692
- Doc?
- Yeah?

51:51.317 --> 51:53.083
He's been hit by 556.

51:53.852 --> 51:57.195
Blew out his calf muscle
but there's no arterial bleeding.

51:57.315 --> 51:58.949
- He'll make it.
- Roger that.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.470
Why aren't they angry?

52:03.607 --> 52:06.706
They are grateful to be liberated
and welcome the Americans as friends.

52:09.716 --> 52:11.838
- These mistakes are unavoidable in war.
- Bullshit!

52:13.125 --> 52:14.975
We're fucking recon Marines!

52:16.610 --> 52:18.519
Our whole fucking job is to observe

52:18.639 --> 52:20.428
and not make these kinds of mistakes.

52:21.036 --> 52:23.014
And we don't fucking shoot unarmed kids.

52:23.435 --> 52:25.018
Where did this happen?

52:31.945 --> 52:34.192
Dude, they were tending
their camels and shit,

52:34.685 --> 52:36.320
so who knows where it was.

52:41.679 --> 52:42.778
Fuck, man.

52:44.086 --> 52:45.120
Trombley did this.

52:54.791 --> 52:55.519
Sir...

52:55.639 --> 52:58.925
Priority one surgical pediatric,
four bullet wounds to the abdomen,

52:59.369 --> 53:01.637
144 tach weak; 30 rest,

53:02.058 --> 53:05.057
90 over palp. He's... stable for now.

53:05.629 --> 53:08.101
Godfather's denied the request
to cas-evac the boy.

53:10.552 --> 53:12.314
We need to cas-evac him or he's dead.

53:13.147 --> 53:14.888
I'll go ask
the battalion commander again.

53:15.008 --> 53:16.291
Thank you, sir.

53:18.773 --> 53:21.023
Shot by that asshole Trombley, Brad.

53:21.357 --> 53:24.076
He's been zipped by 556
from Trombley's saw.

53:26.073 --> 53:27.923
Don't put this on Trombley.

53:28.694 --> 53:30.544
- I'm responsible.
- Yeah?

53:32.536 --> 53:34.753
20 other Marines drove by them
and didn't shoot.

53:36.726 --> 53:39.976
Why don't we bring Trombley here
to see what he's done?

53:41.297 --> 53:43.429
Don't say that. It was my order.

53:44.073 --> 53:45.190
What can I do here?

53:45.310 --> 53:47.641
Not a fucking thing, apparently, Brad.

53:52.224 --> 53:54.496
There's gotta be something we can do.

53:54.616 --> 53:56.984
Under the rules, we have to
provide him with care until he dies.

53:58.300 --> 53:59.124
Yeah.

53:59.870 --> 54:00.821
Well, so...

54:02.321 --> 54:05.200
Put him in my care. I'm billeted
next to the battalion commander.

54:05.362 --> 54:06.576
If he's in my care

54:06.737 --> 54:09.914
and godfather has to watch him die,
he might change his order.

54:10.276 --> 54:12.959
- Right, let's do this.
- It's the only chance we got.

54:14.385 --> 54:16.169
- All right, on three.
- Gentle.

54:16.330 --> 54:18.032
Ready, one, two, three.

54:19.424 --> 54:20.299
Ready?

54:20.595 --> 54:21.711
Let's go.

54:54.987 --> 54:56.377
What the hell is going on here?

54:56.700 --> 54:58.128
We brought him here to die.

55:04.867 --> 55:06.637
Get him the fuck out of here.

55:09.451 --> 55:10.451
Stafford.

55:13.407 --> 55:15.604
- Set him down over here.
- Sergeant Major.

55:17.018 --> 55:18.856
What the fuck is going on?

55:20.571 --> 55:21.416
Sir.

55:22.426 --> 55:24.196
Bravo Two in rebellion.

55:24.316 --> 55:27.099
Because they thinks
they shot an Iraqi child.

55:28.194 --> 55:29.644
Does he want water?

55:29.789 --> 55:31.087
Keep him still.

55:31.895 --> 55:34.655
You're requesting that I send
this wounded civilian

55:34.775 --> 55:36.000
to the R.C.T. for aid?

55:38.622 --> 55:39.578
Problem.

55:40.904 --> 55:44.571
Our tactical situation
is extremely precarious here.

55:48.843 --> 55:51.708
These are the northern most
Marines' positions.

55:52.249 --> 55:54.480
And we are 30 kliks north of them.

55:56.203 --> 55:58.063
We are far behind enemy lines.

55:59.518 --> 56:01.317
We have incomplete intel

56:01.478 --> 56:04.328
as to the disposition
of the Iraqi units here,

56:04.470 --> 56:06.113
here and here.

56:07.359 --> 56:08.695
We don't even know

56:08.815 --> 56:11.993
what happened to the 4,000 troops
that were at this airfield

56:12.154 --> 56:13.359
six hours ago.

56:14.370 --> 56:16.267
And there's only 350 of us.

56:18.644 --> 56:19.793
What can be done?

56:20.957 --> 56:22.049
Option one:

56:22.740 --> 56:24.276
cas-evac by helicopter.

56:24.396 --> 56:25.558
Doesn't exist.

56:26.521 --> 56:28.803
Army, Marines are engaged.

56:29.061 --> 56:30.411
Taking casualties.

56:31.877 --> 56:34.809
Last night the Iraqis
stopped the army advance.

56:35.717 --> 56:38.182
They turned back 36 apache helicopters,

56:39.344 --> 56:40.601
shot a few down.

56:43.087 --> 56:44.155
Option two:

56:45.142 --> 56:46.748
I detach a platoon

56:47.481 --> 56:49.824
and have them drive kliks

56:50.111 --> 56:53.035
through enemy lines
to the shock-trauma unit here.

56:55.812 --> 56:58.735
If any of you were a casualty right now.

57:00.070 --> 57:02.043
I don't think I could cas-evac you.

57:03.773 --> 57:05.358
But supposing I could,

57:06.671 --> 57:08.884
I imagine there is some of you think

57:09.313 --> 57:11.442
we have to give wounded civilians

57:11.562 --> 57:14.383
every consideration
we would give ourselves.

57:16.154 --> 57:17.504
That is not true.

57:19.615 --> 57:21.024
The R.O.E. say...

57:21.901 --> 57:24.275
we have to give them
the same medical care

57:24.395 --> 57:26.694
they would get by local standards.

57:28.826 --> 57:31.104
The standards here are fucking zero.

57:31.463 --> 57:33.761
It's a shitty situation for us,

57:35.063 --> 57:37.213
but nobody put a gun to our heads

57:37.446 --> 57:38.914
and forced us to come here.

57:40.333 --> 57:41.883
We're all volunteers.

57:56.432 --> 57:57.970
Get me Captain Patterson.

57:58.090 --> 57:59.064
Yes, sir.

58:00.003 --> 58:02.145
Assassin Actual, this is Godfather Five.

58:02.457 --> 58:05.235
<i>Godfather Five, this is Assassin Actual.
Send traffic.</i>

58:05.355 --> 58:06.707
D.X. on the net. Over.

58:06.827 --> 58:09.170
<i>- Standing by.
- I'm dispatching an Alpha platoon</i>

58:09.290 --> 58:11.905
to take this child
to the shock-trauma unit.

58:21.794 --> 58:23.744
Huddle up. We're gonna talk.

58:24.918 --> 58:25.636
Ray.

58:27.478 --> 58:28.986
<i>This is Echo Four Charlie.</i>

58:29.106 --> 58:31.049
<i>Assault Two One Bravo's gone.</i>

58:31.546 --> 58:34.065
<i>Echo Three Lima is up on Two One Bravo.</i>

58:42.831 --> 58:44.581
We made a mistake today...

58:45.565 --> 58:47.549
collectively and individually.

58:48.109 --> 58:49.659
We must get past this.

58:50.062 --> 58:52.988
Can't sit around and call it quits now.
We have fighting ahead.

58:53.557 --> 58:55.281
Look, guys, we're Americans.

58:55.443 --> 58:58.035
We must make sure when we take
a shot that we are threatened.

58:59.359 --> 59:01.830
You gotta see that these
people are just like you.

59:02.360 --> 59:04.522
You gotta see past the huts, the camels,

59:04.756 --> 59:06.904
the different clothes they wear.

59:07.234 --> 59:09.380
These are people
in this fucking country.

59:09.792 --> 59:11.823
This family here might lose a son.

59:12.146 --> 59:14.551
We shot their camels too. One camel.

59:14.671 --> 59:16.612
Could be a year's income to them.

59:17.692 --> 59:20.098
We're not here to destroy
their way of life.

59:20.506 --> 59:22.562
Trombley, you have to
be prepared for the possibility

59:22.682 --> 59:25.225
of a formal investigation
in this shooting.

59:25.582 --> 59:27.259
You need to write it up.

59:29.443 --> 59:30.793
Keep your head up.

59:36.359 --> 59:38.303
Is it going to be okay, Sergeant?

59:38.423 --> 59:39.573
I mean this...

59:39.945 --> 59:41.379
investigation?

59:41.738 --> 59:42.955
You'll be fine, Trombley.

59:44.572 --> 59:46.556
No, I mean for you, Sergeant,

59:47.176 --> 59:49.126
since you gave the all orders.

59:51.414 --> 59:53.492
I don't care about any of this,
you know?

59:53.612 --> 59:55.840
I'll be out in a couple of years.

59:56.456 --> 59:57.466
But you...

59:59.098 --> 01:00:01.070
Sergeant, this is your career.

01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:05.163
I'll be fine.

01:00:10.102 --> 01:00:12.570
<i>Hitman Two Three,
this is Hitman Two Two.</i>

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.279
<i>Watch my six. I'm taking a dump.</i>

01:00:18.294 --> 01:00:19.410
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:00:22.132 --> 01:00:24.955
I don't want to sound like
I'm defending Trombley or anything...

01:00:26.307 --> 01:00:30.002
but how come nobody remembers
that they declared everybody hostile?

01:00:30.535 --> 01:00:32.345
I mean, they told us
to shoot at everybody.

01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:33.274
Yeah.

01:00:34.801 --> 01:00:36.467
But you know what's even more fucked up?

01:00:37.156 --> 01:00:40.373
Trombley only shot two bursts
maybe seven rounds.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.912
I mean, we're bumping down a dirt road,
his targets are like

01:00:47.032 --> 01:00:49.688
200 meters out and he hits exactly

01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:51.899
what the fuck he's shooting at?

01:00:52.337 --> 01:00:53.650
I mean, fuck, man,

01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:56.488
the boy is a cold-on deadeye killer.

01:00:57.379 --> 01:00:58.576
Yeah, no shit.

01:01:00.116 --> 01:01:01.966
That's 'cause he's a psycho.

01:01:06.367 --> 01:01:08.340
But at least he's our psycho.

01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:18.901
You all right, reporter?

01:01:21.563 --> 01:01:22.928
Yeah, I'm just...

01:01:23.048 --> 01:01:23.971
sucking wind.

01:01:30.909 --> 01:01:32.459
What happened today...

01:01:49.347 --> 01:01:51.298
You need to square those walls.

01:01:51.418 --> 01:01:53.794
You'll never make any
progress digging that way.
