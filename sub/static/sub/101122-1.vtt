45:18.834 --> 45:21.200
You've got to hit them
in the pineal gland

otherwise they'll
keep coming for you.

45:23.204 --> 45:24.971
Pineal Gland?

45:24.973 --> 45:27.573
As far back as
the second century,

45:27.575 --> 45:29.709
the pineal was
believed to be the home

45:29.711 --> 45:34.182
of the soul and served as a
conduit between humans and God.

45:36.384 --> 45:40.021
It produces the DMTs,
the spirit molecule.

45:40.922 --> 45:42.722
That's why they attack us.

They're trying to get back

45:43.992 --> 45:46.394
that which was extracted
from their bodies.

45:52.033 --> 45:53.366

45:53.368 --> 45:56.669
that have invaded our
world are soul takers.

45:56.671 --> 46:00.475
When they strike, they feed
upon the eternal spirit

46:01.676 --> 46:02.944
and consume it.

46:04.579 --> 46:07.413

happened and suddenly

46:15.390 --> 46:17.292

46:18.459 --> 46:21.329

came out before him

46:22.497 --> 46:27.400
