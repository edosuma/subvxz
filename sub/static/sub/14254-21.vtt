WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:07.099
We, the people of Earth,

00:07.207 --> 00:10.472
greet you in a spirit
of peace and humility.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.807
As we venture out
of our solar system,

00:12.879 --> 00:16.440
we hope to earn the trust
and friendship of other worlds.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.212
Can you reduce the interference?

00:22.288 --> 00:23.380
l'm trying.

00:25.158 --> 00:27.149
What is it?

00:27.227 --> 00:28.785
l don't know.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.887
Distance?

00:33.666 --> 00:36.658
lt just entered the atmosphere.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

02:36.923 --> 02:39.824
They evolved from dinosaurs?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.724
Hadrosaurs, to be precise.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.490
Their ancestors settled
in the Delta Quadrant

02:44.564 --> 02:45.826
20 million years ago.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.129
The Voth, the Kobali,
the Vaadwaur.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.702
You've made first contact
with more species

02:50.803 --> 02:52.771
than any captain
since James Kirk.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.807
lt helps being
the only Starfleet ship

02:54.908 --> 02:56.341
within 30,000 light-years.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.502
You are being too humble.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.944
From the first time you spoke up
in my classroom,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.447
l knew you'd go far.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.450
A little farther
than l expected, Professor.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.316
l have my Admiral hat
on today, Kathryn,

03:08.388 --> 03:10.822
and l didn't call
just to catch up.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.222
Starfleet has a mission for you.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.693
We, the people of Earth

03:15.762 --> 03:19.027
greet you in a spirit
of peace and humility.

03:19.098 --> 03:21.123
As we venture out
of our solar system,

03:21.234 --> 03:25.170
we hope to earn the trust
and friendship of other worlds.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.468
Friendship l.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.134
l had to memorize
that recording in third grade.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.472
Me, too.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.240
l even built a model
of the probe.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.839
Then this should look familiar.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.115
lt was launched in 2067.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.523
Just four years
after Zefram Cochrane

03:47.594 --> 03:49.425
tested his first warp engine.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.190
What was it designed to do?

03:51.264 --> 03:52.959
Reach out to other species.

03:53.032 --> 03:54.693
Pave the way for all
the manned missions

03:54.767 --> 03:55.791
that would follow.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.426
They packed it
with information--

03:57.537 --> 03:59.095
translation matrices,

03:59.205 --> 04:00.331
scientific
and culture databases.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.498
Computer chip designs,

04:01.608 --> 04:03.508
instructions for
building transceivers.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.168
lt's practically
a how-to manual.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.681
lf the Borg had intercepted
this probe,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.875
humanity would have been
assimilated centuries ago.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.180
Our ancestors had no
idea what was out here.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.983
This must have been before
your Prime Directive.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.182
lt was before Starfleet existed.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.887
ln any case, we lost contact
with the probe 130 years ago.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.087
But its last-known
coordinates...

04:24.163 --> 04:25.425
Let me guess.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.762
We're in the neighborhood.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.864
Starfleet's mapped out
a search grid.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.939
lt'll take us
a little off course,

04:34.073 --> 04:35.870
but if the probe
is still intact,

04:35.942 --> 04:37.842
and we're lucky enough
to find it,

04:37.910 --> 04:40.936
we'll be retrieving
a little piece of history.

04:45.752 --> 04:50.883
Captain's Log, Stardate 5477 5.4.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.948
We've been searching
for five days

04:53.026 --> 04:54.789
without any sign of the probe,

04:54.861 --> 04:57.056
but we're not about
to disappoint Starfleet

04:57.130 --> 04:59.564
on our first official assignment
in seven years.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.657
Nothing in Grid 295.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.235
Mr. Paris.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.826
Moving on.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.632
We should try
skipping ahead a little

05:06.739 --> 05:08.536
to Grid 310.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.700
l stayed up all night

05:09.809 --> 05:11.970
re-extrapolating
the probe's trajectory.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.980
l've compensated for
solar winds, ionic interference,

05:15.048 --> 05:17.482
and a few local anomalies
Starfleet wouldn't

05:17.550 --> 05:19.780
know about.

05:19.852 --> 05:21.945
Alter course to Grid 310.

05:23.356 --> 05:26.291
Trying to impress
the Starfleet brass?

05:26.359 --> 05:27.690
Just doing my job.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.128
l'm detecting
a titanium signature

05:36.235 --> 05:38.601
that matches
the probe's parameters.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.899
Location?

05:40.073 --> 05:41.404
A planet two light-years away.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.941
Confirmed.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.874
Good job, Harry.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.619
The readings are coming
from the northern subcontinent.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.951
Can you localize them?

05:58.057 --> 05:59.854
There are high levels
of antimatter radiation

05:59.926 --> 06:02.554
in the atmosphere, scattering
the probe's signature.

06:02.662 --> 06:03.629
Any life signs?

06:04.797 --> 06:06.162
None.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.324
Assemble an away team

06:07.400 --> 06:09.732
and take the Flyer
down for a closer look.

06:14.006 --> 06:16.031
You seem to be in a good mood,
Doctor.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.871
Just excited to be doing my part

06:17.944 --> 06:20.276
for our first official
mission, Mr. Carey.

06:20.346 --> 06:24.339
An inoculation a day
keeps the radiation away.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.851
l took a look at those
atmospheric readings.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.853
Thermal eddies,
gravimetric shear.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.014
You're going to need
your best pilot.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.489
Are you volunteering?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.116
Well, if the Doc can spare me.

06:34.193 --> 06:36.593
l'll muddle through.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.891
lf you're here
for your fetal resonance scan,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.126
you're a day early.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.668
l'm here for my inoculation.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.465
You are not going
on this mission.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.471
Chakotay said he needed
an engineer.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.098
He's already got one.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.698
Now he's got two.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.278
Will you excuse us?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.071
Any bets on this one?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.879
My money's on B'Elanna.

06:58.951 --> 06:59.883
lt's been months

06:59.952 --> 07:01.078
since l've been
on an away mission.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.848
Then try the holodeck.
The Flyer is full.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.686
You can make room.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.815
Neelix doesn't have to go.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.255
He's not six months pregnant.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.317
Being pregnant doesn't
make me an invalid.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.264
No, it doesn't,

07:14.333 --> 07:16.631
but there's a toxic atmosphere
down there,

07:16.736 --> 07:18.704
and you're breathing for two.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.569
All right, you win.

07:25.645 --> 07:29.513
But if we have another baby,
you carry it,

07:29.582 --> 07:32.107
and l'll go
on the away missions.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.312
lt's a deal.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.892
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.259
We'll be clearing
the stratosphere

07:45.331 --> 07:46.559
in about a minute.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.666
l had a cousin who used
to transport disulfides

07:52.772 --> 07:54.637
from a gas giant.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.675
He claimed
to love the turbulence.

07:58.244 --> 08:02.772
Of course, disulfides
are known to cause delusions.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.612
Hang on.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.778
l thought it was uninhabited.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.290
There's nothing alive
down there now.

08:12.358 --> 08:15.020
Radiation levels
are at 6,000 isorems.

08:15.094 --> 08:18.757
l've localized the signature
to a three-kilometer radius.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.492
Transfer the coordinates
to the helm.

08:20.566 --> 08:23.501
When we find the probe,
we'll beam it to the cargo hold.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.332
That may not be easy
with all this radiation.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.429
We'd better bring
transport enhancers.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.599
Set us down, Tom.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.040
Yes, sir.

08:31.110 --> 08:33.840
Gently, please.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.798
l should have brought
a holo-camera,

08:56.903 --> 08:59.838
so l could show B'Elanna
she's not missing anything.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.305
Can you believe
she actually wanted

09:01.407 --> 09:03.068
to come with us?

09:03.109 --> 09:04.599
When my wife was pregnant,

09:04.710 --> 09:06.803
she didn't want
to be coddled, either.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.537
And she's not half Klingon.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.082
Oh, maybe it's us.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.378
Something about

09:12.451 --> 09:14.942
fatherhood seems
to regress the male psyche

09:15.021 --> 09:16.283
a few thousand years.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.769
Tom, be careful.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.572
lt's a toy.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.376
Like a music box.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.881
Vivaldi.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.349
l'm getting something.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.481
90 meters this way.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.786
Souvenir.

09:58.798 --> 10:03.394
Commander, l'm detecting
an antimatter signature ahead.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.702
Looks like missile silos.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.438
Paris to Chakotay.

10:13.512 --> 10:14.638
Go ahead.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.705
We've got a reading
that could be the probe.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.443
lt's inside a cave.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.815
Keep us posted.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.966
The warhead is still active.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.570
lt wouldn't have taken
many of these

10:38.638 --> 10:40.606
to trigger a nuclear winter.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.503
People must have
taken shelter here.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.014
Well, it makes sense.

10:50.082 --> 10:51.549
The magnesite in these caves

10:51.617 --> 10:53.642
would have provided
partial shielding

10:53.719 --> 10:55.016
from the radiation.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.124
Over here!

11:00.192 --> 11:02.023
What'd you find?

11:02.094 --> 11:05.325
Some kind of control room...
or laboratory.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.990
Laboratory?

11:07.066 --> 11:08.795
Lots of diagnostic equipment.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.028
Looks like it was salvaged
from a junk heap.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.230
Or scavenged from the ruins.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.042
Particle scanners,

11:23.115 --> 11:24.878
circuit analyzers...

11:24.950 --> 11:26.918
Most of it's still functional.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.750
They were working on something.

11:37.663 --> 11:39.824
This is what we came for.

11:39.899 --> 11:43.426
Whoever lived here
must have been studying it.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.266
The datacore is still intact.

11:46.372 --> 11:50.240
Start setting up
the transport enhancers.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.674
Paris to Chakotay.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.006
Go ahead.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.444
We found the probe.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.504
Well, pieces of it, anyway.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.948
We're getting ready to beam it
back up to the Flyer.

11:59.018 --> 12:00.383
We'll meet you there.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.218
Hello?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.781
ls someone there?

12:06.859 --> 12:10.727
The tricorder isn't
reading any life signs.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.935
Don't move.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.139
You okay?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.715
Delta Flyer to Paris.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.717
Chakotay to away team.
Respond.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.092
They're antimatter weapons.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.029
Shields are off-line.

13:25.838 --> 13:26.896
What are you doing?

13:27.039 --> 13:28.028
Getting us out of here.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.402
What about the others?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.636
We can't do them any good
if we're dead.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.075
We'll come back for them.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.045
Look, you're making
a mistake...

13:39.585 --> 13:42.247
Leave them alone!

13:46.525 --> 13:47.651
Who are you?

13:47.726 --> 13:50.126
l'm Lieutenant Tom Paris.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.494
We're from the Federation
Starship Voyager.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.026
What are these?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.969
They're transport enhancers.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.404
We were going to use them
to retrieve our probe.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.238
Your probe?

14:07.646 --> 14:09.841
Too bad you didn't come
for it sooner.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.406
You would have saved us
a lot of suffering.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.288
We still can't
contact the others

14:17.356 --> 14:18.846
or get a fix
on their life signs.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.391
Why didn't we detect
the aliens?

14:20.459 --> 14:21.585
l don't know.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.060
Whoever they are, they
have antimatter weapons.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.221
Antimatter?

14:25.297 --> 14:26.628
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.825
Go ahead.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.390
We are being hailed
from the surface.

14:29.501 --> 14:30.559
The away team?

14:30.669 --> 14:32.136
No.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.103
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.306
Who am l speaking with?

14:42.381 --> 14:43.939
My name is Verin.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.950
Your crewmen are my prisoners.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.418
Why? We haven't done
anything to harm you.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.080
You committed genocide.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.749
l think there's been
a misunderstanding.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.259
We arrived here just...

14:55.327 --> 14:56.521
You're from Earth?

14:56.595 --> 14:57.960
Yes.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.565
Then you're going to pay
for what your people did to us.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.965
l'm sorry, l don't know
what you're talking about.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.296
We're not as naive

15:04.403 --> 15:07.463
as you seem to think
we are, Captain, not anymore.

15:10.109 --> 15:11.736
What is it you want?

15:11.810 --> 15:16.543
l want you
to get us off this planet.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.106
Find us a new home.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.620
Release my crewmen and
we can talk about it.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.053
No more talking.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.853
Your people won't be safe
until mine are.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.622
Listen, l don't
respond well to threats.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.754
And l don't want to kill anyone,

15:31.830 --> 15:34.094
but l will
if you don't cooperate.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.497
You have three hours

15:35.601 --> 15:37.091
to begin evacuating us.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.407
Start scanning
for the nearest M-Class planet.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.944
You intend to meet his demands?

15:47.079 --> 15:49.070
l'm just keeping
my options open.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.115
You're with me.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.210
l've analyzed his garment.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.152
lt's lined with magnesite.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.156
A makeshift environmental suit.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.886
Unfortunately, the protection
it offers is limited.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.861
His tissues are saturated
with antimatter radiation.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.661
lt explains why we couldn't
detect his life signs.

16:07.733 --> 16:09.633
They're virtually
indistinguishable

16:09.735 --> 16:10.929
from the environment.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.060
Now that we know that,

16:12.171 --> 16:13.832
maybe we can adjust our
sensors to detect them.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.098
Let's wake him.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.589
What were you doing
aboard our shuttle?

16:33.359 --> 16:35.884
Trying to undo the damage
you caused.

16:35.961 --> 16:38.521
lf you're referring to what's
happened on your planet,

16:38.597 --> 16:40.189
we had nothing to do with it.

16:40.265 --> 16:41.755
Your people sent the probe...

16:43.168 --> 16:44.294
...didn't they?

16:44.403 --> 16:46.633
Our ancestors sent it
300 years ago,

16:46.739 --> 16:49.037
to make contact
with other species.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.973
They did
a little more than that.

16:52.611 --> 16:53.703
Am l your prisoner?

16:53.779 --> 16:55.144
No. You're suffering

16:55.214 --> 16:57.546
from prolonged
radiation exposure.

16:57.616 --> 16:58.708
l can treat you.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.274
You can?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.819
l believe l can.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.454
ln exchange for what?

17:05.523 --> 17:07.320
Nothing.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.694
l have a wife, friends.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.700
We might be able
to help them, too,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.999
but not while our crewmen
are being held hostage.

17:19.104 --> 17:22.540
You said you were trying
to undo the damage we caused.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.608
What did you mean by that?

17:25.644 --> 17:26.872
l was aboard your shuttle

17:26.944 --> 17:28.469
looking for technology

17:28.547 --> 17:31.641
that might help us
neutralize the radiation.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.582
We saw missiles on the surface.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.745
Was the destruction
caused by war?

17:35.821 --> 17:37.618
Those missiles were built
for defense.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.883
They were never launched.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.584
Then what accounts
for the devastation?

17:40.659 --> 17:44.686
A containment failure
in our power grid.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.594
Once the antimatter
was released,

17:46.665 --> 17:48.030
it destroyed everything.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.400
l'm sorry, but l still don't see
how we're responsible.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.735
Before the probe,

17:55.808 --> 17:59.938
my people never conceived
of anything like antimatter.

18:00.012 --> 18:03.277
''We offer this information
freely with the hope

18:03.315 --> 18:05.806
''that one day
we will stand on your soil

18:05.918 --> 18:08.478
and extend our hands
in friendship.''

18:08.554 --> 18:10.681
l'm sure you recognize
those words.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.656
The recording from the probe.

18:12.724 --> 18:16.990
Your people sent us technology
that they knew would destroy us.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.030
l don't understand.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.963
We didn't either at first,

18:21.033 --> 18:22.694
but we had decades
to think about it,

18:22.801 --> 18:25.702
and now it seems so obvious.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.298
You send us new technology,
encourage us to use it,

18:29.408 --> 18:32.844
and then you wait for us
to obliterate ourselves.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.536
Why would we do that?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.080
Because it's easier
than invading us.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.413
Do you really believe
we'd contaminate a world

18:39.485 --> 18:41.146
we intended to conquer?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.188
l'm a scientist.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.621
l believe what l see.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.251
And today, l saw your people
standing on our soil

18:48.327 --> 18:49.453
just as you promised,

18:49.528 --> 18:51.723
and they were wearing
equipment that protected them

18:51.797 --> 18:53.890
from the radiation,
because they knew

18:53.966 --> 18:57.629
exactly what to expect.

18:57.736 --> 19:02.571
lf you were in my position,
what would you believe?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.813
He might have a concussion.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.215
l need the medkit from my pack.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.414
l was told not
to let you use your equipment.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.790
When's your baby due?

19:29.701 --> 19:31.601
My wife's pregnant, too.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.605
We're expecting a little girl
in a couple of months.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.641
How do you know it's a girl?

19:36.708 --> 19:38.141
Well, we have technology

19:38.210 --> 19:41.111
that allows us
to examine the fetus.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.306
She has my eyes

19:42.381 --> 19:44.212
and her mother's cranial ridges.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.045
ls this your first?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.783
No.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.156
Oh.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.195
Boys? Girls?

19:58.263 --> 20:00.857
Two boys and a girl.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.001
What are their names?

20:07.372 --> 20:09.203
They were all stillborn.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.441
l'm sorry.

20:14.513 --> 20:18.279
You're... a doctor?

20:18.350 --> 20:20.477
No, l'm just a medic.

20:22.588 --> 20:25.580
But we have the best doctor
in the Quadrant back on Voyager.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.454
He might be able to help...

20:27.526 --> 20:29.619
l shouldn't be talking to you.

20:33.198 --> 20:37.794
Our current coordinates
and the nearest M-Class planet--

20:37.903 --> 20:39.461
132 light-years away.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.765
At maximum warp,

20:40.872 --> 20:42.863
that's about two months
round trip.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.136
How many people are
we talking about?

20:45.210 --> 20:47.201
lf these sensor modifications
are correct,

20:47.279 --> 20:49.941
about 5,500.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.006
lt would take
at least 17 trips--

20:52.084 --> 20:54.951
almost three years--
to complete the relocation.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.817
We've made sacrifices
to help people before.

20:56.888 --> 20:58.549
What about Tom and the others?

20:58.624 --> 21:00.091
Are they supposed
to rot down there

21:00.158 --> 21:01.625
until this relocation's
finished?

21:01.693 --> 21:03.661
l don't think
Verin's going to let go

21:03.729 --> 21:05.287
of his only bargaining chips.

21:05.364 --> 21:08.094
Then we may have to use force.

21:08.166 --> 21:11.192
Not until we've exhausted
every other option.

21:11.303 --> 21:14.272
These people believe
that we're violent.

21:14.339 --> 21:17.672
l'm not going to do anything
to reinforce that belief,

21:17.743 --> 21:22.146
unless it becomes
absolutely necessary.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.750
l've extracted the nanoprobes.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.653
l'll begin reprogramming them.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.819
Nanoprobes?

21:36.895 --> 21:38.226
Microscopic machines.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.698
Hopefully they'll help us
repair your damaged tissue.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.201
You said you extracted them.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.736
From where?

21:45.837 --> 21:46.963
My bloodstream.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.369
They maintain
my cybernetic implants.

21:49.441 --> 21:53.002
Nanoprobes, cybernetic implants.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.343
Are others
on your crew like you?

21:56.415 --> 21:59.816
No, l'm... unique.

21:59.885 --> 22:01.648
You certainly are.

22:01.753 --> 22:04.586
l need a word with your patient.

22:05.624 --> 22:07.615
You told me you've been
looking for ways

22:07.693 --> 22:09.126
to neutralize the radiation.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.526
All my life.

22:11.596 --> 22:14.360
Tell me about your work.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.501
Lieutenant?

22:21.573 --> 22:22.835
l'm okay.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.808
My stomach's
just a little queasy.

22:24.876 --> 22:27.140
Our inoculations
must be wearing off.

22:27.212 --> 22:29.407
l thought these caves
were naturally shielded.

22:29.481 --> 22:32.473
They're no substitute
for an environmental suit.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.212
These people have lived here
all their lives

22:34.286 --> 22:35.480
without environmental suits.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.886
These people have lived here
without much of anything.

22:39.758 --> 22:43.216
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.957
lt's all right.
We're not going to hurt you.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.690
What's your name?

22:48.767 --> 22:50.064
Yun.

22:50.168 --> 22:51.965
Uh, mine's Tom.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.935
This is Joe and Neelix.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.875
You're not like them.

23:01.980 --> 23:06.610
We're different species,
but they're my friends.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.316
They say you're going
to take us on your ship

23:10.389 --> 23:12.823
and find us a new home.

23:12.891 --> 23:16.019
l'm sure our Captain
is trying to help you.

23:16.094 --> 23:20.224
Neelix...
where's our ''souvenir''?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.830
ln my pack.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.267
Uh, excuse me.

23:26.338 --> 23:29.603
Um, we'd like
to give her something.

23:29.674 --> 23:32.336
lt's in the equipment bag.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.377
lt's a toy.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.407
That could be a weapon.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.606
lt's harmless.

24:14.719 --> 24:17.313
These men are dangerous.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.152
l want you to stay away
from them.

24:19.224 --> 24:20.851
Understood?

24:27.566 --> 24:30.558
Well, so much
for making friends.

24:31.837 --> 24:32.895
Mr. Verin?

24:33.004 --> 24:34.130
What are you doing?

24:34.239 --> 24:35.706
My job.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.242
l'm Voyager's Ambassador,
remember?

24:38.343 --> 24:41.779
Can l have a word with you?

24:55.393 --> 24:57.384
Just between us...

24:58.697 --> 25:00.892
l understand why you
don't trust humans.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.763
Then why are you with them?

25:03.869 --> 25:07.930
They're not so bad once
you get to know them.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.973
When l first met them,

25:10.041 --> 25:13.306
l thought they were arrogant,
self-righteous.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.970
l suppose
you're going to tell me

25:15.046 --> 25:16.308
you've changed your mind.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.474
Well, not completely.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.144
l still think
they take themselves

25:21.219 --> 25:23.517
far too seriously
for my taste...

25:25.457 --> 25:29.291
but one thing they don't do
is harm other people.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.828
Are you blind?

25:30.896 --> 25:35.230
No, l see very clearly
what's happened to you,

25:35.300 --> 25:36.733
and l'd like to help.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.098
How?

25:39.204 --> 25:41.502
My Captain listens to me.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.370
l can speak to her
on your behalf,

25:43.441 --> 25:45.238
help her understand
your situation.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.007
What do you know
about our ''situation''?

25:51.449 --> 25:53.940
l know what
you've been through.

25:54.019 --> 25:57.352
My planet was destroyed
by a weapon

25:57.422 --> 25:59.322
called a metreon cascade.

25:59.391 --> 26:03.487
Hundreds of thousands
of people were killed...

26:03.595 --> 26:05.825
including my family.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.696
How did you survive?

26:08.767 --> 26:13.704
l was on a neighboring planet
when the weapon was detonated.

26:13.772 --> 26:18.869
l went back with a rescue team,
but there was no one left.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.674
l'm sorry about what happened
to your family...

26:23.782 --> 26:25.750
but don't compare your life
to mine.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.888
The nearest suitable planet
is simply too far away,

26:36.962 --> 26:39.897
so l'd like to propose
an alternative.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.158
There is no alternative.

26:41.232 --> 26:42.324
Please, hear me out.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.562
We have one of your people
aboard, a Mr. Otrin.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.865
He has some interesting ideas

26:47.973 --> 26:50.373
about counteracting
the radiation.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.242
Otrin has too many ideas.

26:54.312 --> 26:57.076
l think his theories have merit.

26:57.148 --> 27:01.585
What he's lacked until now
is the means to carry them out.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.451
lf you release the hostages,
we can work together.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.114
There's a good chance

27:06.191 --> 27:09.354
we could undo some of the damage
to your environment.

27:09.427 --> 27:10.985
This isn't a negotiation.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.927
You don't seem to understand.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.762
lt would take years to evacuate
the entire planet.

27:15.834 --> 27:18.200
So instead,
you once again offer us

27:18.303 --> 27:20.828
the benefits of your technology.

27:20.972 --> 27:24.840
What l'm offering you
is a realistic alternative.

27:24.909 --> 27:28.037
lf l release the hostages,

27:28.113 --> 27:32.140
what's to prevent you
from leaving or attacking us?

27:32.217 --> 27:34.981
Look, l know you've suffered,
and l know you don't trust us.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.248
You haven't given me
any reason to.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.689
Then why don't we start
with a small step?

27:40.759 --> 27:43.387
You return one of the hostages,

27:43.461 --> 27:47.261
and l'll send you a supply
of food and medicine.

28:01.312 --> 28:05.248
You... what's your name?

28:05.316 --> 28:07.079
Joe Carey.

28:07.152 --> 28:11.748
Set up your...
transport enhancers.

28:38.583 --> 28:42.280
l'm sorry... Mr. Carey.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.850
Sorry?

28:46.925 --> 28:50.258
Your crewman's ready, Captain.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.387
Transport him to Sick Bay.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.066
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?!

28:57.168 --> 28:59.227
Tom?

28:59.337 --> 29:01.635
Sick Bay to Bridge.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.172
They've killed Lieutenant Carey.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.683
lf you think murdering
one of my crewmen

29:16.755 --> 29:19.087
is going to make me
more receptive to your demands,

29:19.157 --> 29:20.419
you're mistaken.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.223
Don't force me
to kill anyone else.

29:27.665 --> 29:31.829
All right.
l'll evacuate your people,

29:31.970 --> 29:34.268
but our transporters
aren't designed

29:34.339 --> 29:36.136
to accommodate large groups.

29:36.207 --> 29:39.142
We'll need time to modify them.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.111
We'll be ready within the hour.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.772
lf you're not...

29:43.848 --> 29:47.011
l understand.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.177
My ready room.

29:49.587 --> 29:51.282
You have radiation poisoning.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.187
This will make you feel better.

29:53.258 --> 29:55.283
Thank you.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.887
Why are you helping us?

29:58.963 --> 30:02.228
Your child's going
to need a father...

30:03.668 --> 30:04.726
isn't she?

30:10.441 --> 30:13.604
The first phase
of your therapy is complete.

30:15.246 --> 30:18.044
How do you feel?

30:18.116 --> 30:19.378
l can breathe more easily.

30:19.450 --> 30:21.179
Your lungs were damaged
by the radiation.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.813
The nanoprobes
are repairing them.

30:24.889 --> 30:27.790
lt's incredible.

30:27.859 --> 30:30.794
lf we could manufacture
more of these,

30:30.862 --> 30:33.660
we might be able
to treat everyone.

30:33.731 --> 30:37.360
Unfortunately, Mr. Verin
has refused our help.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.936
Did you expect him to cooperate?

30:40.038 --> 30:43.007
His behavior is irrational.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.199
To you, maybe,

30:44.309 --> 30:47.335
but you haven't
lived like we have.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.175
No, but that doesn't mean

30:49.247 --> 30:51.647
that we're responsible
for what's happened here.

30:51.716 --> 30:53.581
You can't deny
your people sent the probe.

30:53.651 --> 30:56.552
They made
an error in judgment.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.020
They failed to anticipate

30:58.156 --> 31:00.021
the consequences
of their actions,

31:00.058 --> 31:02.117
but they never meant
to destroy your world.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.629
Human culture has evolved,
learned from its mistakes.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.722
So can yours.

31:09.634 --> 31:16.164
Even if l believed you,
Verin never would.

31:16.274 --> 31:19.107
Then your people may need
a change of leadership,

31:19.177 --> 31:22.943
someone more open to new ideas.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.912
l'm not a leader.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.780
But you're a scientist,

31:26.851 --> 31:30.685
someone who can see a problem
and envision a solution.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.087
The same definition
could apply to a leader.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.158
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.926
My daughter...
she'll have food,

31:42.033 --> 31:45.002
medical care,
everything she needs.

31:46.437 --> 31:47.870
What's wrong?

31:47.939 --> 31:50.407
We need help.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.966
lt's the baby.

31:53.077 --> 31:56.535
lt's too soon.

31:58.149 --> 32:00.845
Let him help me.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.018
Can you?

32:06.090 --> 32:11.255
l think so,
but l'll need my medkit.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.700
lnform Verin.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.478
l'm losing the heartbeat.

32:28.546 --> 32:29.376
Oh, no!

32:29.447 --> 32:30.379
What are you doing?

32:30.448 --> 32:31.574
Speeding up the contractions.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.315
Their ship's returned.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.218
Send out patrols.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.594
Double the guard
at the entrance.

33:11.456 --> 33:14.186
l've got him!

33:14.258 --> 33:16.886
He's not breathing.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.553
Cardio-stimulator.

33:21.199 --> 33:23.099
Three millijoules.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.102
Now.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.144
Don't move.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.445
l'll take him to Verin.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.417
Find the others.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.512
This way. Move!

33:49.127 --> 33:51.322
lncrease the charge
to five millijoules.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.160
Again.

33:58.002 --> 33:59.993
l'm reading a heartbeat.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.375
Oh!

34:12.617 --> 34:14.915
You have a son.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.649
Oh.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.451
One of the patrols
took another prisoner.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.594
Put him with the others.

34:35.706 --> 34:38.231
We need to get him to Voyager.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.003
He stays here.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.178
Mr. Tuvok?

34:45.283 --> 34:48.377
Your Captain was foolish enough
to think she could rescue you.

34:48.453 --> 34:51.149
lnstead, she's given me
another hostage.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.455
Doc?

35:02.533 --> 35:05.058
When you need to infiltrate
a toxic environment,

35:05.169 --> 35:06.727
it helps to be a hologram.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.703
Prepare the transport enhancers.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.797
Tuvok to Chakotay.

35:09.907 --> 35:11.340
We've secured the hostages.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.536
Good work.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.206
Chakotay to Delta Flyer.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.043
Two to beam out.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.157
Thank you.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.024
Now, Mr. Paris.

35:34.765 --> 35:38.701
Your baby won't survive
without treatment.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.499
l promise we'll bring him back.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.742
Take good care of him.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.375
l will.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.724
Tuvok to Voyager.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.791
Five to beam up.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.139
Cute little fellow, isn't he?

36:24.215 --> 36:26.240
He's already
responding to treatment.

36:26.317 --> 36:27.443
Once he's stabilized,

36:27.518 --> 36:29.315
we'll transport him
to the surface,

36:29.387 --> 36:31.878
and send along some food
and medical supplies.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.854
We're leaving?

36:33.925 --> 36:36.189
As soon as l report
to Starfleet.

36:41.098 --> 36:42.531
Captain.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.397
Once the baby's back
in that environment,

36:44.502 --> 36:45.992
he's just going
to get sick again.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.128
l'm sorry, we can't keep
him from his mother.

36:48.239 --> 36:49.831
l'm not suggesting that.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.408
You told those people

36:51.475 --> 36:53.636
that we might be able to
neutralize the radiation.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.803
Was that true?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.312
Yes, but they didn't
want our help.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.506
l can't force it on them.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.844
Maybe you should.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.111
lf we help them without
asking anything in return,

37:01.219 --> 37:02.846
it'll prove
they're wrong about us.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.252
You're forgetting something.

37:04.322 --> 37:05.550
They killed Mr. Carey.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.147
l'm not about to risk
any more lives

37:07.225 --> 37:08.192
to help murderers.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.352
Captain, it was one man
who killed Carey.

37:10.428 --> 37:14.694
lf you saw how they were living,
how desperate they are...

37:14.765 --> 37:16.699
l'm not saying we should
ignore what happened,

37:16.767 --> 37:18.462
but humans did play a part
in their suffering.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.230
lntentional or not,

37:20.338 --> 37:22.932
that probe had a terrible
impact on these people.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.065
lf there's anything we can
do to make up for that now,

37:25.176 --> 37:26.666
we at least have to try.

37:29.313 --> 37:31.008
l've adjusted
the radiation levels

37:31.082 --> 37:33.312
to match the conditions
on the surface.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.875
Watch.

37:35.953 --> 37:37.318
An isolytic chain reaction.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.652
lt recombines
the nucleonic particles

37:39.724 --> 37:41.715
in the atmosphere.

37:45.796 --> 37:48.822
How do we apply your methods
on a planetary scale?

37:48.899 --> 37:51.595
Atmospheric processors
are one possibility.

37:51.702 --> 37:54.830
Too bad we don't have a corps
of engineers to build them.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.073
What if we encased
the catalytic agent

37:59.143 --> 38:00.201
in photon torpedoes,

38:00.311 --> 38:02.677
used the concussive force
to start the reaction?

38:03.881 --> 38:04.973
lt would require

38:05.049 --> 38:07.813
multiple detonations
at a low altitude,

38:07.885 --> 38:09.944
but l believe it could work.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.819
Captain, an isolitic reaction
of that magnitude

38:12.890 --> 38:14.687
would expand exponentially.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.659
Your ship might not survive.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.661
We'll have to modify
our shields,

38:18.729 --> 38:20.560
reinforce structural integrity.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.656
Well, let's get started.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.332
He's beautiful.

38:27.438 --> 38:30.771
And they can give us enough
medicine to treat everyone.

38:30.841 --> 38:32.775
Can they rebuild our cities?

38:32.843 --> 38:34.868
Bring back the people who died?

38:35.012 --> 38:36.604
They're offering to help,

38:36.681 --> 38:38.876
and this time
no one's coercing them.

38:38.949 --> 38:41.008
We can't trust these people.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.553
They just sent armed men
to attack us.

38:43.621 --> 38:45.111
They only wanted
to rescue their hostages.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.453
Who knows what they wanted?

38:47.525 --> 38:49.390
You're being irrational.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.987
What's irrational
is cooperating with the enemy.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.430
Look at my child.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.900
They said
that they would treat him,

38:59.036 --> 39:01.732
and they kept their word.

39:04.909 --> 39:07.639
Shield modifications on line.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.680
Torpedoes?

39:09.747 --> 39:10.907
Ready.

39:10.981 --> 39:12.243
Hail them.

39:14.719 --> 39:15.811
Listen to me.

39:15.886 --> 39:18.684
Otrin, we're ready to begin.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.520
Understood.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.393
Good luck.

39:25.463 --> 39:26.794
Tom, take us down.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.969
We're 10,000 meters
into the troposphere.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.943
Fire the first sequence.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.458
They're attacking us!

39:55.526 --> 39:57.391
lt's only the shock wave
from the detonations.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.096
No.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.099
Shields?

40:05.202 --> 40:06.760
Holding at 18 percent.

40:08.806 --> 40:12.105
Are you going to stand there
while he helps them destroy us?

40:17.381 --> 40:18.780
What are you doing?

40:19.817 --> 40:21.341
Fighting back.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.952
Captain, they're opening
missile silos.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.354
They're targeting Voyager.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.156
At 18 percent, our
shields won't withstand

40:31.228 --> 40:32.923
an antimatter explosion.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.589
We should return to orbit.

40:34.665 --> 40:35.927
Not yet.

40:36.033 --> 40:37.466
Fire the next sequence.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.260
You can't launch those missiles!

40:41.372 --> 40:42.600
Hold him!

40:42.706 --> 40:44.367
Stop!

40:46.110 --> 40:47.737
What are you doing?

40:47.812 --> 40:50.212
l won't let you ruin our
only chance for survival.

40:51.715 --> 40:53.580
You'd kill me?

40:55.386 --> 40:56.876
To save my child...

40:56.954 --> 40:58.888
yes.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.550
Get that weapon away from her.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.423
No... sir.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.896
l've kept you alive...

41:06.997 --> 41:08.328
all of you!

41:08.399 --> 41:10.799
And we're grateful for that.

41:10.901 --> 41:13.870
But survival
isn't enough anymore.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.873
Are you in command now?

41:18.776 --> 41:20.368
lf l have to be.

41:21.779 --> 41:23.576
Everyone,

41:23.647 --> 41:24.739
come outside! Hurry!

41:24.815 --> 41:25.839
All right, come on.

41:25.916 --> 41:26.940
What's going on?

41:27.051 --> 41:28.143
Bring him.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.345
This way.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.368
lt's beautiful.

41:53.377 --> 41:55.436
Captain's Log, supplemental.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.004
We've retrieved Friendship l

41:58.115 --> 42:00.208
and resumed our course
to the Alpha Quadrant,

42:00.317 --> 42:04.117
but the success of our mission
had a very high price.

42:07.758 --> 42:09.692
lmpressive, isn't it?

42:09.760 --> 42:12.558
The detail's amazing.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.825
Carey spent months
working on it.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.130
He used to joke
that it wouldn't be finished

42:18.235 --> 42:19.896
by the time
we got back to Earth.

42:20.004 --> 42:23.235
He only had one nacelle to go.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.868
We were able to download
the probe's memory core.

42:28.946 --> 42:32.814
We'll transmit the telemetry

42:34.184 --> 42:36.277
l think about our ancestors...

42:36.353 --> 42:37.786
thousands of years

42:37.855 --> 42:40.722
wondering if they were alone
in the universe,

42:40.791 --> 42:42.952
finally discovering
they weren't.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.463
You can't blame them
for wanting to reach out,

42:46.530 --> 42:49.624
see how many other species
were out there

42:49.700 --> 42:51.725
asking the same questions.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.303
The urge to explore
is pretty powerful.

42:54.371 --> 42:58.273
But it can't justify
the loss of lives...

42:58.342 --> 43:00.674
whether it's millions...

43:02.012 --> 43:04.640
or just one.
