I swear I'm gonna come to New
York at some point. I swear.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.807
Your birthday's soon, right?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.934
Yeah, March 26.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.437
Let's do a weekend
in the city to celebrate.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.189
March in Manhattan is much nicer
than March up here

00:23.231 --> 00:24.899
in the Great White North.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.819
Mm, Great white North
begs to differ.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.697
You ever been spring skiing?

00:30.739 --> 00:34.034
There's nothing like hitting the
slopes in shorts and a T-shirt.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.161
Assuming there are
slopes to hit.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.538
This warm weather keeps up,
there won't be snow much longer.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.206
Guys, guys, guys, they're
coming. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Okay, get ready.

Yup.
AJ:
For what it's worth,

collateral damage, Adam.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.441
Happy to oblige,

I was a husband,

I was a partner,

03:56.653 --> 03:59.239
I was a protector.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.658

Since then, we've had

08:02.440 --> 08:05.234
a bunch of days in a row
of record-high temperatures.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.652
Means all that snow is melting.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.571
Yeah. And fast.

Adam works for our forest
service, but

08:10.615 --> 08:13.451
he has some experience in
hydrology, he ran the numbers.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.537
All of that runoff is gonna
swell the Woonsock River

08:16.579 --> 08:17.955
way beyond its banks.

08:17.997 --> 08:18.831
You're talking about a flood.
Mm-hmm.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.208
MAYA:
In winter?

08:20.249 --> 08:21.501
But there's still snow
on the ground.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.627
You can't have
a flood in winter.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.545
You can. And it's the last time

08:24.587 --> 08:25.963
of year you would want to.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.465
Ice chunks blowing
through dams and levees

08:27.507 --> 08:28.799
like frozen torpedoes.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.176
Water so cold
you get hypothermia

08:30.218 --> 08:31.302
just by looking at it.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.720
And even if the air temperature

08:32.762 --> 08:34.722
falls back down
to normal winter numbers,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.141
the water's already moving
too fast to freeze.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.143
So neighborhoods
bordering the river

08:39.185 --> 08:41.771
are in the most danger,
along with low points

08:41.812 --> 08:43.272
here and here.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.941
How much danger?

08:44.982 --> 08:48.236
In 24 hours, most of Greylock

09:06.254 --> 09:07.672
Greylock is in the same boat.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.131
Pun intended, I assume.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.384
We don't have a National Guard

09:11.425 --> 09:13.177
or a FEMA to come bail us out.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.929

09:14.971 --> 09:16.681

09:16.722 --> 09:19.350
Well, you could, but he'd
probably laugh in your face.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.561
No, I-I mean I literally can't.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.521
I don't have the number.
I can't get past

09:23.563 --> 09:24.730
the White House switchboard.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.148

09:26.190 --> 09:27.942

officially recognized.

spread dangerously thin.

12 trainees. That's all

10:02.893 --> 10:05.062
and a sale at the
Army/Navy store?

10:05.104 --> 10:08.107
What we need is someone
who knows how to organize

10:08.149 --> 10:10.443
large-scale disaster relief.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.403
So where do we find
that somebody?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.625
You know we don't have
to knock, right?

10:25.666 --> 10:26.959
This is our house.
Yeah.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.878
Today is hard enough
without having to

10:28.919 --> 10:32.298
walk in on him
in his underwear.
Mm.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.507
Hey, what? You guys
don't have to knock.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.134
It's your house.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.303
Okay, so in 18 hours, our house
is gonna be under water,

10:37.345 --> 10:38.971
as well as the rest
of Greylock.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.598
We need your help to make sure
that doesn't happen.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
You worked in the Bureau
of Overseas Buildings Operations

10:43.517 --> 10:45.102
while you were
at the State Department.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.979
You faced natural disasters
all over the world.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.357
Just understand that
I was a contractor,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.317
not a first responder.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.569
What you are is the only person
in Greylock with the experience

10:53.611 --> 10:54.904
to fight this flood.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.114
It's the only way
to save the town.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.454
Okay, well, let's make a plan.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.915
SARAH:
We have a plan. We're facing
a dangerous winter flood,

11:05.956 --> 11:07.917
but we have a plan.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.086
Step one is to evacuate
all at-risk citizens

11:10.127 --> 11:11.420
to higher ground.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.381
So this means young children,

11:13.422 --> 11:18.052
the elderly, anyone with
mobility difficulties.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.596
The Wrights Mountain
Observatory is open

11:20.638 --> 11:23.557
if anyone needs
a safe place to stay.

11:23.599 --> 11:28.229
Volunteers there will have food,
water and medical supplies.

11:28.270 --> 11:32.358
Everyone else will handle
step two, property protection.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.111
We're gonna focus our efforts
on the South and West Basins,

11:35.152 --> 11:37.613
as well as areas
that border the river.

11:37.655 --> 11:42.243
Gullies, culverts,
storm drains have to be clear.

11:42.284 --> 11:43.369
We're gonna need
as many sandbags

11:43.411 --> 11:45.037
as we can get our hands on.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.666
So anything that even resembles
a bag, fill it up.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.252
Strategic choke points
and sandbag berms will slow down

11:51.293 --> 11:54.672
and redirect water flow.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.382
Let me be clear.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.677
We are on our own in this fight.
There is no help coming

11:59.719 --> 12:02.138
and we have no reinforcements.

12:03.347 --> 12:06.142
But what we do have
is each other.

12:06.183 --> 12:11.313
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's all we need.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.191
When we work together,
we can fight off blizzards,

12:14.233 --> 12:17.653
we can open borders, we can
bring billion-dollar companies

12:17.695 --> 12:19.280
to their knees.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.950
When we work together,
we are invincible.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.703
This flood is about
to find that out.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
(indistinct chatter)

12:27.788 --> 12:30.332
Oh, careful
with those guns, Corinne.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.168
Oh, these babies?
You don't want to hurt nobody.

12:32.209 --> 12:35.421
Au naturel. Five months
of carrying around a kid

12:35.463 --> 12:37.757
who always thinks
the floor is lava.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.800
Where is Josh?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.802
Uh, he's at my parents'
place in Vermont.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.096
Evacuation sleepover.
Ah.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.306
I see.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.683
Grover.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.310
What's up?

12:49.351 --> 12:51.729
Hey, I need a favor.
Can you run to my dad's facility

12:51.771 --> 12:53.063
and make sure they're evacuated?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.065
I'd go myself,
but I'm still on the clock.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.318
I-I'm sure they're on it,
I just, I worry, you know?

12:57.359 --> 12:58.944
And you're the only one
who knows he's there.
Yeah.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.863
Paul's plan is-is on track,
so nobody will mind

13:00.905 --> 13:02.281
if I step out for a second.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.158
(exhales)
Thanks, Groves. I appreciate it.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.327
You know I got your back.
Cool.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.871
Dearborns.
Bye.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.417
PAUL (over radio):
Choke point four is stable.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.170
Let's move all remaining
sandbags to six.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.880
Got to say, pretty impressive,

13:17.922 --> 13:20.674
your dad putting
all this together.
I know.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.386
Guy can organize 300
people to fight a flood,

13:24.428 --> 13:25.763
but can't figure out
how to write one letter

13:25.805 --> 13:27.431
to his teenage daughter.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.183
You find out where he was
during all those years away?

13:29.225 --> 13:32.394
Everywhere but Greylock.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.231
Pakistan, Ghana, Peru,
you name it.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.650
He helped out with the
flooding in Nepal last year.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.194
I guess that's how he learned
about this disaster stuff.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.862
In the Myagdi District?
I remember that.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.614
Over a hundred deaths.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.116
I thought you covered politics,
not natural disasters.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.952
Uh, they're more connected
then you'd think.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.412
The, uh, squabbling
between India and Nepal

13:50.454 --> 13:53.958
about how to handle aid relief
was a disaster in and of itself.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.418
MAN:
We've got water rising quickly
in quadrant five.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.422
Are we clear to pull the
choke point and flood The Glenn?

14:00.464 --> 14:03.884
Wait, wait, wait, sorry, what
was that about The Glenn?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.219
PAUL:
We have to flood it
to release some pressure.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.972
Call it a pawn sacrifice.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.933
The Penny Lane Playhouse
is in The Glenn.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.563
(car doors close)

14:16.522 --> 14:18.065
Oh, my God.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.234
What-what did you do?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.987
Don't worry.
Ev-- Everyone's evacuated.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.530
The area's clear.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.656
You talked me through
every piece of your plan.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.158
Flooding The Glenn wasn't in it.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.828
Water was coming in so fast
in the southern edge of town

14:30.870 --> 14:33.205
that we couldn't
keep up with it.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.540
A hundred homes
would've been destroyed,

14:34.582 --> 14:35.833
twice as many dairy cows,
so I improvised.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.585
Why you didn't you tell me?

14:37.626 --> 14:39.962
I called you an hour ago,
you didn't answer.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.213
We were stacking sandbags
at Stone Orchard.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.590
There's no reception there.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.632
Well, you should've
sent someone to get me.

14:43.674 --> 14:44.967
Hey, the clock was ticking.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.343
I had to send
the water somewhere.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.262
The-The Glenn
is virtually empty.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.598
There's nothing
of real value there.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.308
Uh, relatively speaking,
it's an easy place to lose.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.144
The Penny Lane Playhouse
is in The Glenn.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.353
Come on.
The theater's dead anyway.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.688
What?

14:57.730 --> 14:58.772
You asked me to save the town,

14:58.814 --> 14:59.982
I'm saving the town.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.944
We made the right call here.
Come on. Don't be upset.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.448
You don't get to tell me how
I am supposed to feel.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.909
If you knew anything about me,
you would know that.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.466
Hey.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.843
Got your text. Just
finished my patrol.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.303
All the flood prep is done.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.305
That's great.
Thanks for checking on my dad.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.266
Mm, like I said, the place
was-was empty when I got there.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.685
Did you figure out
where they took the residents?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.520
Yeah, a nurse finally
called me back.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.230
They evacuated everyone to
a temporary spot down the road.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.649
Almost everyone.
(dog barks)

15:41.690 --> 15:43.067
What the hell was that?

15:43.108 --> 15:44.985
GROVER:
The almost.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.528
(laughs softly)

15:46.570 --> 15:49.365
You really ought to check
your deliveries.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.075
That does not look
like an heirloom.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.452
GROVER:
I found him outside
your dad's place. No collar.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.663
Aw, did you make him this toy?
Yeah, it was nothing.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.332
Guessing he belongs
to one of the residents.
Oh, I doubt it.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.875
They're not allowed
to have pets.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.710
Oh, there's a shelter
down the road, though.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.629
Little guy must've gotten lost
in all the flood commotion.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.547
Well, can you bring him back?
It's not exactly food safe

16:05.589 --> 16:06.966
having a dog in the kitchen.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.217
If he is from the shelter,

16:08.258 --> 16:09.343
they'd probably
let you keep him.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.636
Oh, no, no, no, AJ, uh-uh.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.513
I can barely
take care of myself.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.890
Take that dog
out of here.
Okay.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.435
Uh, I have to drop some stuff
off at the observatory,

16:18.477 --> 16:22.272
so I'll bring him back
to the shelter on my way.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.358
Yeah, great.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.528
(sighs)

16:27.569 --> 16:29.905
Hey. I think I'm
gonna head back

16:29.947 --> 16:31.782
to the high school,
turn on the power.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.075
Now that everything's safe,
I think we'll be back at it

16:33.117 --> 16:34.660
by tomorrow.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.995
Well, the kids will be thrilled.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.247
Oh, you know what?
They better be.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.165
My English class is
a frickin' delight.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.126
You, uh, you want me
to come with you?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.669
No, it's okay.
I'll be right back.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.557
Representative Jiménez.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.642
Always a pleasure.
Is this, uh,

16:58.684 --> 17:01.186
one of your dad's famous
specials I keep hearing about?

17:01.228 --> 17:02.563
Mashed potatoes,

17:02.604 --> 17:04.356
peas, vegan
meat substitute

17:04.398 --> 17:05.858
and chili flakes.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.735
He calls it Not Today, Seitan.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.654
S-E-I-T-A-N.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.157
So, what are you working on?

17:13.198 --> 17:14.783
God, just some research
on a whistleblower

17:14.825 --> 17:16.744
called "Capero326."

17:16.785 --> 17:21.248
You could say Capero326
is my... my white whale.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.959
Mm. We read Moby-Dick
last semester,

17:24.001 --> 17:25.377
and it didn't exactly
end too well

17:25.419 --> 17:27.212
for the guy chasing the whale.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.214
Yeah, well, I'm more
of an Ishmael than an Ahab.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.799
Mm.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.760
Capero revealed
some-some pretty bad behavior

17:32.801 --> 17:34.344
in the U.S. State Department.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.305
I'm betting it's just
the tip of the iceberg.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.098
So are you looking
for the rest of it?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.767
Well, somebody should be.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.518
You know, the press is what
keeps governments honest.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.606
Well, with seitan on your side,
anything is possible.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.566
Hail, seitan.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.901
(chuckles)

17:49.902 --> 17:54.156
Hey, um,
I'm sorry about earlier.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.450
Tyler, you didn't
do anything wrong.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.660
Yeah, well, I didn't do
anything right, either.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.579
It takes two to tango.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.999
Or not tango, in our case.

18:06.960 --> 18:11.173
Just, I feel like we...
thought about it way too much

18:11.215 --> 18:12.966
and planned it out that...

18:13.008 --> 18:14.802
That when the moment

18:14.843 --> 18:16.929
finally came,
there was just a lot of...

18:16.970 --> 18:17.971
Pressure.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.306
Yeah.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.270
Hey, what if we take
a sex break?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.022
Maybe if we stop

18:27.064 --> 18:30.609
worrying so much about
getting to where we're going,

18:30.651 --> 18:33.779
we'll enjoy the ride
a little bit more.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.367
PAUL:
I'm sorry about
The Glenn.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.702
Don't be.
You made the right call.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.750
I don't know why
it feels like I didn't.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.504
Greylock has zero
federal emergency services.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
Something had to give.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.592
If that something's
The Glenn, so be it.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.766
But to say that there's nothing
valuable there...

19:06.937 --> 19:10.107
I grew up
at the Penny Lane Playhouse.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.317
It's where I, um...

19:12.359 --> 19:15.195
it's where I learned to be
comfortable in my own skin.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.906
It's where I learned how to
stand up in front of a room

19:17.948 --> 19:20.117
full of people and
not get scared.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.079
It let me escape
to different world for a while

19:24.121 --> 19:27.666
and forget about the one
waiting for me at home.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.670
Yeah, see, I, uh,
I didn't know about any of that.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.172
Yeah, like you didn't know
I'm allergic to cranberries.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.257
But I know
that you're a fearless leader.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.636
That is chapter 92
of my life story.

19:39.678 --> 19:42.014
You can't skip
the other 91 chapters

19:42.055 --> 19:44.391
and pretend like
you read the whole book.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.435

SARAH: Why is there water
in the high school?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.704
That's the West Basin.
I thought all the sandbagging

22:52.746 --> 22:54.331
we did this morning was
going to keep that dry.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.958
It was supposed to.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.960
Chokepoints five and six
must've failed.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.796
The only way that happens is
if the water level gets

23:00.837 --> 23:02.422
higher than we thought it would.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.800
Maybe Adam screwed up
the snowmelt calculation.

23:04.841 --> 23:05.926
I triple-checked--
his numbers are good.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.386
If there's extra water,
it's got

23:07.427 --> 23:08.637
to be coming
from someplace else.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.472
A secondary source.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.810
The Zabelle Dam--
it's the only place to our west

23:14.851 --> 23:17.104
that could dump that much
water that quickly.
BELLA: But...

23:17.145 --> 23:19.314
the Canadians are doing all the
same things we're doing, right?

23:19.356 --> 23:21.525
Sandbagging,
building barriers.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.569
All those resources and they
can't stop a dam from failing?

23:24.611 --> 23:26.696
Oh, my God.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.158
It's a pawn sacrifice.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.452
AJ:
What?

23:32.494 --> 23:36.164
If the reservoir behind
the dam overflows,

23:36.206 --> 23:38.583
all that water dumps
into populated areas.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.669
Quebec would lose hundreds
of businesses and homes.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.088
But if the dam fails,
all that water is just released

23:43.130 --> 23:45.966
downstream. The Canadians
must've made the same decision

23:46.007 --> 23:47.801
about Greylock
that we made about The Glenn.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.719
They let the dam fail

23:49.761 --> 23:51.763
so that they could save
other places.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.641
Can they do that?
Yeah, Greylock is
an unrecognized country.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.560
Letting us get destroyed
costs them nothing.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.355
We're their pawn sacrifice.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.027

To The Glenn.

are we supposed to dig

34:40.578 --> 34:44.373
We had to try out all

34:44.415 --> 34:47.168
Okay, this might sound
kind of weird,

34:47.210 --> 34:50.505

kind of liberating.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.185
A caretaker.
