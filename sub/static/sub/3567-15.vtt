Ranger guy. One of my guys.
You know... Guys?

G.U.Y.S.!

00:43.164 --> 00:46.766

- What's that I hear?

00:57.989 --> 01:01.667
You can't find your little men

01:01.702 --> 01:06.452
It's not that bad.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.555
- How'd that get in there?
- You left your window

01:09.623 --> 01:13.536
- wide open for things to just fly in and out.
- Aww, give him a break, P.

01:13.571 --> 01:16.462
My room's messy, but I always
find what I'm looking for.

01:16.530 --> 01:20.822

- I haven't looked for it yet.

01:28.024 --> 01:30.876
Pearl, all your

01:30.944 --> 01:34.346
- Is everything okay, Steven?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

01:34.414 --> 01:37.090

Sorry you walked
through that door without

01:45.175 --> 01:47.026
a hose in your hand, ready for battle!

01:48.220 --> 01:51.597
- Wait!
- Man, you look sad and wet.

01:51.665 --> 01:55.768
- What happened to your life, little guy?
- I... lost something.

01:55.836 --> 01:58.938
- Something precious.
- Your innocence?

01:59.005 --> 02:04.713
I lost ranger guy.
One of my guys from our special

02:04.748 --> 02:06.445
day at the beach last summer.

02:06.513 --> 02:09.187
You bought him for me
at the end of the day.

02:09.285 --> 02:12.525
He was one of a kind.
He had a miscolored hat.

02:12.526 --> 02:15.688
- How could you not remember?
- Oh.

02:15.755 --> 02:19.232
Was this the same day we
ate that awesome funnel cake?

02:19.233 --> 02:22.862
- Uh, huh?
- Yeah, man. That funnel cake...

02:22.963 --> 02:26.832
- I even kept the plate. Come on!
- Cool balloons.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.090
<i>U, let's see here. Got
cans, napkins, oh, a yo-yo,</i>

02:32.125 --> 02:35.541

sandwich I've been meaning to</i>

02:35.542 --> 02:37.776
<i>catch up on... Ow, my butt!</i>

02:37.844 --> 02:41.514
Wait.
What's your story again?

02:41.581 --> 02:44.683
I lost my special ranger
guy, and I'm quite upset over it.

02:44.751 --> 02:47.786
Huh. Well... here's
a bag full of quarters.

02:47.854 --> 02:50.890
Now you can get all the guys you want.

02:50.957 --> 02:54.115
- Thank you.
- What did you say?

02:54.116 --> 02:55.694
Thank you!

02:55.795 --> 02:59.632
<i>We'll be reunited
soon, ranger guy. Here we go.</i>

02:59.699 --> 03:04.403
- And...
<i>- Dave guy!</i>

03:04.471 --> 03:06.272
<i>- What?!
- Lucky!</i>

03:06.273 --> 03:09.248
<i>Not lucky!
He's, like, the worst guy.</i>

03:09.249 --> 03:13.119
Maybe he comes with
something cool. Taxes?

03:13.154 --> 03:16.949
Come on, Dave guy!
Is this all you have to offer ...

03:17.017 --> 03:20.563
a bunch of paperwork? Answer me!

03:20.564 --> 03:25.264
- Thank goodness I have all these qauarters.
<i>- Dave guy!</i>

03:25.314 --> 03:27.628
<i>- No!
- Dave guy!</i>

03:27.695 --> 03:30.381
- Stop it!
<i>- Dave guy!</i>

03:30.499 --> 03:32.933
Ranger guy!

03:32.934 --> 03:37.441
<i>This machine is out of guys.
Please try again another time.</i>

03:37.515 --> 03:39.060
It's over.

03:40.674 --> 03:43.375
Huh?
Oh. Onion.

03:43.443 --> 03:45.457
What are you doing?

03:45.458 --> 03:48.480
He's got a ranger guy?!

03:48.548 --> 03:52.351
Onion! Wait up!
Let's trade!

03:52.452 --> 03:57.523
Which way did he go? Oh!
I guess he needs a suitcase.

03:57.591 --> 04:01.133
<i>Is he haggling with that guy?
He's a tough customer.</i>

04:01.134 --> 04:07.499
<i>Looks like they worked
something out. </i>

04:07.601 --> 04:10.033
Huh? Did he get that guy's lunch?

04:10.057 --> 04:12.713
I wonder how this is gonna play out.

04:16.041 --> 04:20.211
<i>Oh, man. Hey, good looking.</i>

04:20.245 --> 04:22.982
What the heck is he doing?!

04:23.083 --> 04:27.653
He's not even hungry?!
Not the tomatoes!

04:27.721 --> 04:31.457
Huh?

04:31.524 --> 04:35.638
Hey. Is that Onion's dad?

04:40.517 --> 04:43.268
<i>I guess they don't need words.</i>

04:43.336 --> 04:47.373
Huh? He's leaving so soon?

04:47.440 --> 04:52.478
<i>Does Onion just... sit around
and wait for his dad all day?</i>

04:52.545 --> 04:55.481
<i>Ranger guy! Okay. Let's do this.</i>

04:55.482 --> 04:58.645
Hey, Onion.
How are you?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.767
That's good. That's good.

05:00.768 --> 05:05.758
I couldn't help but notice that
you're a guys fan.

05:05.759 --> 05:11.905
You know, guys?
The little man in your back pocket?

05:11.940 --> 05:16.064
Yeah, ranger guy.
How would you like to trade that

05:16.159 --> 05:20.196
boring old ranger guy
for a brand-spanking-new,

05:20.294 --> 05:25.336
mint-in-box Dave guy!
Pretty nice, right?

05:26.946 --> 05:28.914
Oh. I see where this is going.

05:28.915 --> 05:31.437
You're getting quite the deal here...

05:31.472 --> 05:34.753
<i>with two Dave guys!
Yeah!</i>

05:34.821 --> 05:38.624
What? You want more?
Like... two more?

05:38.725 --> 05:40.837
Five more. 10 more?

05:40.838 --> 05:43.571
20 more.
This whole bag?

05:43.572 --> 05:48.300
All 30 of these Dave guys
for just one ranger guy!

05:48.401 --> 05:51.804
But there aren't any more.
The machine's empty.

05:51.805 --> 05:54.807
I bought them all.
Where are you going?

05:54.874 --> 06:00.679
<i>Hey! Let's work something out.
Ranger guuuuy!</i>

06:01.719 --> 06:04.011
<i>Ugh, stupid Dave guy.</i>

06:04.046 --> 06:07.519
<i>Got no future, your haircut's
gross, you smell bad...</i>

06:08.355 --> 06:10.656
<i>- You talking about Pearl?
- No.</i>

06:10.724 --> 06:13.065
<i>I'm talking about dumb, old Dave guy.</i>

06:13.066 --> 06:14.626
I mean, just look at him.

06:14.694 --> 06:17.821
<i>Does it look like his
life is going anywhere?</i>

06:17.822 --> 06:19.682
Ah, cut him a break.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.934
Maybe this is the year
he gets his life together.

06:22.001 --> 06:24.207
Maybe he'll get a cool internship.

06:24.271 --> 06:27.295
I doubt it. I can't
even trade 30 Dave guys

06:27.296 --> 06:29.734
with Onion to get one ranger guy!

06:29.769 --> 06:32.094
So, you need more of that little man

06:32.188 --> 06:34.079
- to get some other little man.
- Yeah.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.143
And the machine is sold out of them.

06:36.178 --> 06:39.830
<i>- What is that?
- Pearl's replicator wand.</i>

06:39.865 --> 06:41.620
<i>You can use it to make copies of stuff.</i>

06:41.688 --> 06:44.523
<i>You're magic. I'm sure you
can figure out how to use it.</i>

06:44.591 --> 06:47.526
Have you been sitting
here all day with this in your hair?

06:47.627 --> 06:52.030
Nah. I got up to look for Pearl's
dumb ax but found that instead.

06:52.098 --> 06:56.612
Then I replicated a bunch of garbage
and stuffed it all in Pearl's room.

Great.

08:14.548 --> 08:17.124

08:17.125 --> 08:18.951
<i> I used to be a doctor.</i>

08:19.018 --> 08:22.654
Maybe you're just
more fun around other ...

Guys? Dave guy?
I thought I saw the last of ...

08:27.623 --> 08:32.297
Uh. Hey!
What's the big i... dea?

08:32.365 --> 08:35.116
Onion!

08:37.937 --> 08:41.065
This is ridiculous.
How did he get my replicator?

08:41.100 --> 08:43.937
That child should not
be in possession of such an item.

08:43.972 --> 08:48.881
- Aren't these Steven's little men? Oh!
- They're called "Guys!"

08:48.948 --> 08:51.851
Can you please explain this mess?

08:51.852 --> 08:54.754
<i>I traded that
replicator for ranger guy.</i>

08:54.755 --> 08:58.490
Steven, why didn't
you just replicate ranger guy?

08:58.558 --> 09:01.593
- Dang it!
- Let's go before this gets any worse.

09:01.661 --> 09:05.585
Whoa! Uh.
How do you move in this stuff?

09:05.620 --> 09:10.300
- Try and act like a rich duck.
- What does that mean?

09:10.335 --> 09:12.613
Oh, my gosh! I just
wanted some ice cream.

09:12.614 --> 09:15.718
- Hi, Greg.
- What the heck is going on out here?

09:15.753 --> 09:21.150
Uh, you know, just doing our thing.

09:22.628 --> 09:26.257
Hand it over.
It doesn't belong to you.

09:29.589 --> 09:36.728
- This is not a game.
- What did he shoot?

09:36.796 --> 09:39.598
Go under!

09:43.937 --> 09:49.908
- At least it stopped raining toys.
- Ah! Rich duck!

09:49.976 --> 09:54.813
Ooooonion!

09:57.583 --> 10:00.497
Onion, please stop. Let's trade back.

10:00.498 --> 10:03.428
You take ranger guy. He's the best.

10:03.429 --> 10:06.358
He even has a miscolored h...

10:06.426 --> 10:11.764
This is my ranger guy!
You traded me my own guy!

10:11.799 --> 10:15.509
Our trade didn't count.

10:15.510 --> 10:17.795
That didn't work.

10:17.830 --> 10:20.005
I'm never letting
Amethyst borrow anything again.

10:20.073 --> 10:24.048
- Garnet!
- I'm not cleaning up this mess.

10:27.113 --> 10:30.582
I think I understand why
you took my ranger guy, Onion.

10:30.650 --> 10:33.532
I bet you get pretty lonely
waiting for you dad all day.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.445
<i>You were probably really bored, too.</i>

10:36.446 --> 10:39.358
And 'cause you missed your dad,
you took my ranger guy,

10:39.459 --> 10:43.395
which is a symbol of the
relationship I have with my dad.

10:43.496 --> 10:46.583
<i>No? Just the first thing?</i>

10:46.618 --> 10:50.729
Well, here.
You need him more than I do.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.647
Let's go.

10:52.682 --> 10:54.606
So, all the stuff
that got copied turned into nothing?

10:54.674 --> 10:56.729
<i>- Yep.
- Rats.</i>

10:56.764 --> 10:58.652
That was really cool what you
did back there.

10:58.653 --> 11:02.216
- Thanks, Dad.
- But you went through all that trouble for a toy?

11:02.251 --> 11:04.316
It was more about the
memories than the toy.

11:04.384 --> 11:06.152
Now we have new memories ...

11:06.217 --> 11:09.477
<i>- horrible, horrible memories.
