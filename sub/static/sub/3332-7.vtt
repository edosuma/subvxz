WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.435
Latin lover narrator:
Okay, here's where we left off.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.371
<i>Jane the virgin</i>
<i>got accidentally inseminated.</i>
<i>But I've never had sex!</i>

00:05.373 --> 00:08.540
<i>And this created a lot of</i>
<i>problems for a lot of people.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:11.243
<i>First, there's rafael,</i>
<i>the father of the baby.</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:13.245
<i>He recently found out</i>
<i>his wife was cheating on him.</i>

00:13.247 --> 00:14.713
We're done, petra.
What?

00:14.715 --> 00:17.249
<i>But petra had bigger problems.</i>

00:17.251 --> 00:18.751
<i>See, she was being blackmailed</i>
<i>by a man named ivan.</i>

00:18.753 --> 00:20.552
(speaks czech)
<i>and now she couldn't pay him.</i>

00:20.554 --> 00:23.122
<i>Yup, pretty dramatic.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:26.291
<i>Also dramatic-- jane recently</i>
<i>reunited with her father.</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:28.594
I'm not walking away from you,
jane gloriana villanueva.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.762
<i>And her mother</i>
<i>having grown closer</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:31.397
<i>To him, as well, until...</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:32.798
You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.566
And I'll only
get in the way.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.036
<i>But jane didn't know that.</i>
<i>See, she was busy</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.771
<i>With her new job--</i>
<i>student teaching.</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:40.606
Girls, please welcome
your new teacher,

00:40.608 --> 00:42.241
Miss villanueva.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.343
Erase that photo.
No way.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.511
It's perfect
for our web site.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.346
Have you seen
this web site?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.348
<i>Although teaching was going to</i>
<i>get complicated, as well.</i>

00:49.350 --> 00:51.216
This might might help
bring people to the church.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.785
<i>And speaking of complicated,</i>

00:52.787 --> 00:55.320
<i>Jane just found out her fiancÃ©</i>
<i>had been lying to her</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:57.156
<i>For a very long time.</i>
<i>All this time,</i>

00:57.158 --> 00:59.058
You knew,
and you didn't tell me.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.427
<i>And so, she ended it with him,</i>
<i>but still,</i>

01:01.429 --> 01:03.495
<i>She never expected</i>
<i>this to happen.</i>

01:03.497 --> 01:06.165
<i>And now, we'll continue.</i>

01:10.336 --> 01:13.338
Latin lover narrator:
<i>When jane villanueva</i>
<i>was nearly 19,</i>

01:13.340 --> 01:17.509
<i>She kissed rafael solano</i>
<i>for the very first time.</i>

01:17.511 --> 01:20.679
<i>It was magical,</i>
<i>it was perfect.</i>

01:20.681 --> 01:23.248
He's amazing.
(gasps)
shut up.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.550
The guy you've been
after all summer?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.618
I thought he didn't know
my name, and he did.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.288
Oh, my god, and I swear, the
kiss wasn't even the best part.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.757
We had a talk. It was
like one of those talks

01:31.759 --> 01:35.327
That lasts forever, and then
he looked into my eyes...

01:35.329 --> 01:38.297
<i>Unfortunately, as jane</i>
<i>described their magical talk,</i>

01:38.299 --> 01:40.532
<i>Xo had the distinct impression</i>
<i>that...</i>

01:40.534 --> 01:42.468
He sounds like a playboy, hon.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.137
I know. I know.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.406
He seemed like
he would be,

01:47.408 --> 01:49.408
But he wasn't.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.650
He seemed so sincere.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.486
That's what makes
a good playboy.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.122
You never feel like
you're getting played.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.558
It's a good lesson.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.594
From now on,
stay away from guys like that.

02:11.831 --> 02:16.235
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And for four years,</i>
<i>nine months and 23 days,</i>

02:16.237 --> 02:20.139
<i>Jane did stay away</i>
<i>from guys like that.</i>

02:22.842 --> 02:24.510
(xiomara clears throat)

02:24.512 --> 02:26.578
Sorry to interrupt.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.847
We-we were just...
We-we had the...
I was just

02:28.849 --> 02:31.216
Looking for you because
abuela's waiting in the car.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.718
Okay, sure. Coming.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.787
Okay, I should go home.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.831
<i>In truth,</i>
<i>jane's head was spinning.</i>

02:45.833 --> 02:49.401
<i>What just happened? She broke</i>
<i>up with michael hours ago.</i>

02:49.403 --> 02:51.270
Jane!
(tires screech)

02:51.272 --> 02:52.638
(horn honks)

03:01.447 --> 03:06.185
<i>And yet, she had</i>
<i>this feeling with rafael.</i>

03:06.187 --> 03:08.487
What kind of feeling?

03:08.489 --> 03:12.191
Like I'm meant to be
with him or something,

03:12.193 --> 03:13.825
Which I know
sounds ridiculous.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.695
Yeah, it does.
I'm sorry.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.397
I have to say it.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.499
If it were me,
you would say it.
(scoffs)

03:20.501 --> 03:23.335
You just broke up with michael
who you were with for two years.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.470
Yeah, I know.
It's crazy to jump into
something so fast.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.638
And rafael isn't exactly

03:26.640 --> 03:28.640
A no-strings-attached
rebound guy.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.543
And you're having
a baby together.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.213
What if something goes
wrong? It could get ugly.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.249
Not to mention the fact that we
know he used to be a playboy.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.483
And you're from
different worlds.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.785
He's still married.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.354
And his soon-to-be
ex-wife seems crazy.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.456
Yeah, that's true.
That is all true.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.626
Don't go there, jane.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.628
You're too
smart for that.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.664
Mm.
Latin lover narrator: <i>And yet...</i>

03:52.666 --> 03:55.400
You're totally staring at your
phone, waiting for it to ring.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.536
No, I'm not.
<i>She totally was.</i>

03:57.538 --> 03:58.704
(speaking spanish)

03:58.706 --> 04:01.340
Now, how can I
afford studio space?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.941
What do I look like,
paulina rubio?
(phone ringing)

04:02.943 --> 04:05.410
<i>Omg! It's him, it's him!</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:06.411
Hello?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.813
Oh, hi. Hey. (chuckles)

04:07.815 --> 04:09.448
How are you?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.717
What?

04:13.786 --> 04:16.588
Hey.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.590
Hey.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.659
Hi.
(clears throat)

04:26.299 --> 04:28.267
What are you doing here?

04:28.269 --> 04:29.968
I just really wanted
to see you again.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.806
Jane, our kiss
last night...

04:36.276 --> 04:38.510
Well, it just kind of happened.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.612
Um, before things go further,
I just...

04:40.614 --> 04:42.681
I wanted to do things
the right way

04:42.683 --> 04:44.416
And take you on a date.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.454
I also really want
to kiss you again.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.428
I can't.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.498
Uh, what's wrong?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.833
Come on.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.935
I just ended things
with michael last night,

05:03.937 --> 05:06.905
And my head is spinning,
and however I feel about you...

05:06.907 --> 05:08.407
How do you feel about me?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.575
Just...

05:10.577 --> 05:12.944
Give me some time, okay?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.481
I have a lot on my plate.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.584
No problem. I get it.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.853
Just, um, I don't know.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.389
Let me know
when I can kiss you again.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.592
I'll see you later.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.927
Looking forward to it.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.502
Your phone
was buzzing.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.984
Uh, I have to get ready
for school, but I will see you

05:52.986 --> 05:54.553
At the hotel for
dinner with rogelio.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.987
Actually, I'm gonna skip it.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.723
Why don't you go,
just the two of you?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.891
What happened? You're suddenly
not into rogelio?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.493
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Here's the truth.</i>

06:01.495 --> 06:03.395
<i>Xo didn't want to complicate</i>

06:03.397 --> 06:04.796
<i>Jane's relationship</i>
<i>with her father.</i>

06:04.798 --> 06:06.631
Ugh, he's too dramatic.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.834
Magda: Petra,
what are you doing?

06:08.836 --> 06:11.403
Petra:
Ivan, I'm going to shoot you.
(ivan groaning)

06:11.405 --> 06:13.805
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Petra, you'll recall,</i>
<i>had two big problems.</i>

06:18.644 --> 06:20.912
Petra: I'm going to take off
your pillowcase now, okay?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.082
So just stay calm.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.751
Okay.
(grunts)

06:25.753 --> 06:27.819
No, no, shh.
(grunting)

06:27.821 --> 06:29.154
Ivan, ivan,
keep your voice down.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.722
Get him back in
the closet, petra.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.825
Turn the television on.
He's too loud!

06:33.827 --> 06:34.926
Shh. Shh.
(television playing)

06:34.928 --> 06:37.462
Stop it! Stop!
(grunting)

06:37.464 --> 06:38.597
Man (over tv): Here's a bit
of movie trivia for you.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.731
Did you know that tom selleck...

06:39.733 --> 06:42.067
What is your
plan, petra?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.736
(muffled groaning continues)
I don't know, mother.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.471
I've never
held someone hostage before!

06:48.741 --> 06:52.778
We can't let him go.
He'll tell milos where we are.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.946
Well, we can't just
leave him in there.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.581
He just wants money, okay?
Uh-huh.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.917
$250,000-- that's what
this is about.

06:58.919 --> 07:03.488
You know, I think his price
might just have gone up.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.824
(muffled groaning continues)

07:05.826 --> 07:07.426
Jane?

07:08.528 --> 07:09.928
These are
the flanagans.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.663
Hi.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.032
May I just give you a hug?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.767
A hug?

07:16.536 --> 07:17.903
Oh. (laughs)

07:21.574 --> 07:22.941
You must be a parent
of one of my students.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.777
No.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.680
We don't actually
have kids... Yet.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.482
But we really, really want to.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.783
That's great.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.552
Really? You think so?

07:33.554 --> 07:34.853
Mm-hmm.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.688
That's-that's
incredible.
(laughs)

07:36.690 --> 07:38.190
We're just so happy
to hear that.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.825
Okay.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.059
Thank you, jane.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.694
You're welcome.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.529
(school bell rings)
so I should go.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.798
Of course. God bless you!

07:48.768 --> 07:50.669
You, too.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.138
Thank you so much.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.675
Let's just hope her
fertility rubs off on you.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.745
Oh, stop.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.581
A hug never hurt anyone.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.649
I just think it's wrong.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.251
Nonsense.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.653
I prayed long and hard
about this, and I know

08:08.655 --> 08:10.922
God brought jane to us
for a purpose.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.891
To bring more people
to our church.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.126
Here. Pass out more coins.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.934
It was just so weird,
the way they were staring at me.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.536
Then they asked
for a hug.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.737
Maybe they know
you're my daughter.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.005
My fans do crazy things.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.509
You know, that could
actually be it.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.245
You guys doing okay?
We're great.
I asked for

08:33.247 --> 08:35.080
My salad to be slightly dressed.
This is just dressed.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.549
My potatoes are cold,
there's a smudge on my knife,

08:37.551 --> 08:39.584
And...
(mutters in spanish)

08:39.586 --> 08:41.052
Oh. He is fine.
He's absolutely fine.

08:43.756 --> 08:46.758
So, jane, how
is your mother?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.593
She's fine.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.262
Oh, wonderful.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.197
I'm fine, too.
Make sure she knows that.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.132
What happened to you two?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.034
Why? Did she
say something?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.304
Just that it was complicated
and you were being dramatic.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.207
She said that I was dramatic?!

09:02.209 --> 09:04.543
That's right!
You're looking good!

09:04.545 --> 09:05.744
â™ª

09:05.746 --> 09:07.579
(whoops)

09:07.581 --> 09:08.880
(music stops)

09:08.882 --> 09:11.049
All right!
(clapping)

09:11.051 --> 09:14.085
Great job, girls.
Good job. You were awesome!

09:14.087 --> 09:17.122
We'll see you next week.
Now, get out!

09:18.257 --> 09:20.225
Miss xo?

09:20.227 --> 09:24.029
My daughter really
wanted to introduce us.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.864
Apparently, we both like
pistachio ice cream

09:25.866 --> 09:28.733
And the color orange, so
we're perfect for each other.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.603
Oh, so that's why
eva was asking.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.873
I'll give you two some privacy.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.044
So, here's the deal.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.279
My daughter really
wants me to ask you out.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.914
I don't know how
she knows this,

09:42.916 --> 09:46.217
But apparently you just
ended things with someone?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.987
(crying):
And one, two, three.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.656
One... (crying)

09:51.658 --> 09:53.058
I'm sorry, guys.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.126
I just ended things
with someone.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.829
(crying)

09:57.831 --> 09:59.698
Oh.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.934
So, what do you say?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.170
Want to get some
pistachio ice cream?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.605
I'll wear orange.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.207
Sounds tempting. (laughs)

10:11.310 --> 10:13.812
But I'm not looking
to date right now.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.380
Gotcha.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.149
Well, for the record,
I wasn't planning on doing this.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.753
But then I saw you, and
I figured it was worth a try.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.691
Good-bye.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.765
Hey.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.704
Your watch.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.642
Thank you.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.711
And I was wondering if you
hadn't seen my computer case.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.680
It was in the living room...

10:48.682 --> 10:50.815
Jane, stop.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.718
Come on, jane,
I can't... I can't do this.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.954
Do what?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.989
This. Returning
each other's stuff.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.991
Like, what is happening here?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.193
Look, I lied.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.195
I know that.
I-I didn't want the baby,

11:04.197 --> 11:07.198
And I panicked,
and I am so sorry.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.135
But this is not
the end for us, jane.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.436
You don't go
from marrying someone

11:11.438 --> 11:14.806
One day to breaking up--
it doesn't happen.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.676
I don't know
what to say, michael.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.944
Something's changed.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.946
I, uh...

11:21.948 --> 11:23.882
I'm sorry.
Is this about rafael?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.116
No.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.385
Okay. I'm sorry. I just...

11:27.387 --> 11:29.454
I just had to ask.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.392
I have to go to work.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.101
It was awful and awkward.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.469
Oh, that's terrible.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.805
Want to know what
will help get your mind

11:46.807 --> 11:47.806
Off of it?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.174
â™ª my birthday.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.408
Luca: Congratulations!
You waited a whole

11:50.410 --> 11:52.777
Ten seconds to work in
your birthday.

11:52.779 --> 11:53.912
And it came up
perfectly naturally.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.413
What's going on?

11:55.415 --> 11:56.948
Frankie: Well, you know
how we were supposed

11:56.950 --> 11:59.117
To go to the opening
of that club.
Mm-hmm.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.419
Well, I thought we were on the
list, but it turns out we can't

12:01.421 --> 12:03.488
Get on the list because the guy
who was going to get us

12:03.490 --> 12:04.823
On the list...
She wants you to ask rafael

12:04.825 --> 12:06.825
If he can get us
back on the list.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.194
He's an investor
in the club.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.229
Oh.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.767
Frankie: And he's your
baby daddy, so he kind of

12:15.769 --> 12:16.935
Has to say yes, right?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.773
Yeah, I'll ask him
next time I see him.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.174
Great.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.777
He's right over there.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.984
Have you had enough time?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.787
Ready to go on a date?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.790
No. I came to ask a favor,
actually,

12:38.792 --> 12:41.926
Which is totally unrelated
to our current situation.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.461
And what is our
current situation?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.797
Back to the favor.
So, there's a club

12:45.799 --> 12:47.499
That you're apparently
an investor in.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.300
Viento.
Yes, exactly.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.535
And it's my friend's birthday.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.036
I was dispatched
to ask if you could

12:52.038 --> 12:54.806
Put a group of us on a list.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.141
I'd be happy to.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.542
Great. She'll be thrilled.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.778
But just so you know,
I'm gonna be there, so...

12:59.780 --> 13:01.780
Huh?
Yeah, it's opening night,

13:01.782 --> 13:05.250
I have to make an appearance,
so we'll be there, together.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.786
Not a problem.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.054
But just so you understand,
it's not a date.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.323
Agreed.
Definitely not a date.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.826
No, seriously, it's not a date.
I know, it's not a date.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.128
No. You're smiling
when you say that.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.464
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Say it again, no teeth.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.802
It's not a date.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.873
(clears throat)

13:40.986 --> 13:43.188
So, you want
to get frozen yogurt

13:43.190 --> 13:45.156
And watch <i>love actually</i> tonight?
I can't.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.391
I have plans. It's frankie's
birthday, and we're going

13:46.393 --> 13:47.392
To this club.
What club?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.927
I think viento.
Really?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.495
I've read about that place.
How'd you get in?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.497
Rafael's an investor,
actually, so...

13:52.499 --> 13:54.232
Ah. So he'll be there.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.834
Yes, but we're not
going together.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.468
Yeah, but he <i>will</i> be there.
Enough, mom.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.904
Man:
Next stop, biscayne boulevard.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.343
Rogelio was
asking about you.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.246
Way to change the subject.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.548
So... What'd he say?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.483
Well, he said that
you were the one

14:12.485 --> 14:13.885
That was actually
being melodramatic.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.854
Me?!

14:15.856 --> 14:18.189
Latin lover narrator:
<i>What you are about to witness</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:20.892
<i>Is two creatures</i>
<i>who are inherently dramatic</i>

14:20.894 --> 14:22.493
Attempt to behave like they are

14:22.495 --> 14:24.028
<i>Not dramatic.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:26.030
Oh. Hi there.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.632
How have you been?
Great, actually.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.868
Me, too. Really great.
Happier than ever.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.502
Life is beautiful.
I'm having fun.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.371
I'm having so much fun.
In fact,

14:33.373 --> 14:34.639
I have a date tonight.
Me, too.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.941
You also have
a date tonight?

14:36.943 --> 14:38.643
Yeah, that's right.
So, I tell you I have a date,

14:38.645 --> 14:40.445
And suddenly
you have a date, too?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.247
No, not suddenly.
I already had a date.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.249
You just suddenly know about it.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.950
Well, great.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.952
Wonderful. If we
both have dates,

14:47.954 --> 14:49.888
We should do it
together, you know?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.123
Double date-- for two
people who both have dates.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.992
I can't wait!

14:53.994 --> 14:55.960
Great.
Great.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.196
<i>And now you are witnessing</i>
<i>two creatures</i>

14:58.198 --> 15:00.031
<i>Who both need to find dates.</i>

15:08.007 --> 15:09.641
(exhales)

15:09.643 --> 15:14.145
Look, I'm... I'm here because
I'm desperate, lachlan.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.681
I-I've... Never been
desperate before.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.950
What do you want?

15:18.952 --> 15:22.153
Money. $350,000.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.055
I'll pay it all
back as soon as

15:24.057 --> 15:26.958
I get my divorce-- I'll get more
than enough out of the prenup.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.028
Look, I know you have no reason

15:30.030 --> 15:32.030
To trust me or... Help me

15:32.032 --> 15:34.465
After what I did,
leaving you for rafael

15:34.467 --> 15:36.467
And making you look
bad in that meeting.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.002
You're right.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.939
I have no reason
to trust you or help you.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.708
Magda:
<i>Now what?</i>

15:43.710 --> 15:45.376
I don't know.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.012
We can't keep him
here forever.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.681
We might have
to consider...

15:49.683 --> 15:51.249
What?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.718
I know people from
the old country.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.020
They could take care
of him for us.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.221
Petra:
Mother, that's crazy!

15:57.223 --> 15:59.691
Magda:
It is realistic.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.093
Now, here are your options:
You kill him...

16:03.295 --> 16:05.663
...Or let him go, and
risk milos finding you--

16:05.665 --> 16:07.699
And then you'll
wish you were dead.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.069
Your choice.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.986
What are these?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.721
They're not from me.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.690
I just came by to drop off
your computer case.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.492
They came while
I was here.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.498
You're not the person
I thought you were.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.082
Hi.
We have to talk.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.120
Michael saw
the flowers you sent,

17:02.122 --> 17:04.422
And he was so hurt--
it was awful.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.790
Jane, that wasn't
my intention.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.392
I know.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.594
But that's why
I'm saying it's too soon.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.063
What, because of michael?
Yes, because of michael.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.533
We were engaged. I was...
I was about to marry him.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.535
I'm sorry.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.538
But, jane, he's kind of
been a jerk to me.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.408
And you don't think
that's justified?

17:23.410 --> 17:26.411
I mean, whatever jealousy he was
feeling, clearly he was right

17:26.413 --> 17:28.379
In feeling it,
because there's something here.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.149
That's exactly my point, was
that there's something here.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.417
Don't you understand
there are

17:32.419 --> 17:34.052
Other people's
feelings involved?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.087
We can't just do
whatever we want.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.424
Just stop all of this.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.160
Okay.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.338
Woman:
Jane.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.274
I'm nora.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.608
This is my
husband ben.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.610
We are just so excited
to meet you.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.746
Can I just
get one hug?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.114
I'll be quick.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.215
I swear.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.250
Uh... Oh. Oh!

18:06.252 --> 18:08.653
Do you by any chance
know my father?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.255
Of course.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.390
Ah.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.725
Everyone knows him.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.361
Ben:
Thank you again.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.763
My wife took the coin home,
and we so want

18:18.765 --> 18:20.264
A baby, so we thought
it's worth a try.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.599
Sorry,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.401
What coin are you
talking about exactly?

18:30.709 --> 18:33.344
You're selling coins
with my face on it?

18:33.346 --> 18:36.280
No, not selling-- distributing.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.517
This is crazy!

18:39.519 --> 18:41.252
This is hope, miss villanueva.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.788
This is already bringing
more people to the church.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.690
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

18:45.692 --> 18:48.626
Well, many people like you,
and like st. Theresa,

18:48.628 --> 18:51.262
Are humble
about publicizing their gifts.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.897
I am not a saint.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.233
Yes. We made that clear
in the web site.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.367
You are, however,

18:56.369 --> 18:58.269
A pregnant virgin.

18:58.271 --> 19:01.539
Medical mistake or not,
it is a miracle.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.174
I mean,
think of the moments

19:03.176 --> 19:04.842
That had to happen
to lead you up

19:04.844 --> 19:06.611
To your pregnancy.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.713
And think of the hope
that you are giving others

19:08.715 --> 19:11.349
Who believe in your
extraordinary fertility.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.718
I'm sorry.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.786
I'm just not comfortable
with this.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.727
Nadine:
Anything?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.595
My contact in ecuador confirmed

19:24.597 --> 19:27.565
That sin rostro's shipping
container is coming in two days.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.866
Okay.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.635
Okay, this is big.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.771
We intercept a huge drug
shipment, we're heroes.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.608
What is up with you?

19:37.610 --> 19:39.911
This case is your baby;
you should be celebrating.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.580
I'll celebrate when
we intercept the drugs

19:42.582 --> 19:44.849
And catch sin rostro.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.753
Hi. We're on the list.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.721
Jane villanueva,
party of four.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.757
We're gonna have so
much fun. I promise.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.825
You doing okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.294
Latin lover narrator:
<i>She was not fine.</i>

19:56.296 --> 19:57.728
Follow me, please.
(squealing)

19:57.730 --> 19:59.230
Shh.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.332
<i>Saint jane the virgin</i>

20:01.334 --> 20:04.569
<i>Was in no mood to be</i>
<i>in a nightclub tonight.</i>

20:04.571 --> 20:06.737
<i>And she was certainly</i>
<i>in no mood to see...</i>

20:06.739 --> 20:08.806
<i>Rafael.</i>

20:10.242 --> 20:11.809
(gasps)

20:13.445 --> 20:14.779
Ooh, I knew
your baby daddy

20:14.781 --> 20:15.813
Was gonna be surrounded
by women all night.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.949
Jane:
Look, our drinks are here.

20:19.685 --> 20:22.520
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.755
<i>At least rafael was heeding</i>
<i>jane's warning</i>

20:24.757 --> 20:25.856
<i>And staying away.</i>

20:27.759 --> 20:29.493
I mean, sure,
I like the stage,

20:29.495 --> 20:30.761
But the thing
about television

20:30.763 --> 20:32.263
Is that you get
to touch so many

20:32.265 --> 20:33.998
Lives, all at once.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.466
That's so true.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.634
Plus, plays
are so boring.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.969
That is also true.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.370
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Welcome to the worst</i>

20:39.372 --> 20:40.638
<i>Double date in the world.</i>

20:40.640 --> 20:42.673
So what do you do
for work, marco?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.709
Though we can't all be
international superstars,

20:44.711 --> 20:46.344
We all must make
a living, right?

20:46.346 --> 20:47.912
I'm kind of
in-between jobs.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.014
Oh, so you're unemployed.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.882
(thump)

20:51.884 --> 20:52.917
Currently, yeah.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.785
Hmm.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.787
I played professional soccer
for a few years.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.289
Just retired.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.391
You were a professional
soccer player?

21:00.393 --> 21:03.461
In europe for seven years and
the last five here in the states

21:03.463 --> 21:04.562
With the new york red bulls.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.564
Wait, you're marco esquivel?

21:06.566 --> 21:08.699
Yeah.
You're really awesome.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.734
Oh, I was
all right.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.303
Now I feel stupid
for not knowing.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.572
No, I'm sorry.
I-I usually never lead with it,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.707
Because people tend
to treat me differently.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.276
Rogelio:
Uh,

21:18.278 --> 21:19.810
I agree completely. I
wish people would treat me

21:19.812 --> 21:21.445
Like a normal person.
And here is

21:21.447 --> 21:23.414
The bottle we special ordered
for you, mr. De la vega.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.649
Please, take it away.
I'll be happy

21:24.651 --> 21:26.350
To drink normal people wine.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.953
So, why-why did you stop?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.488
Too old?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.922
My daughter, actually.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.758
I was just traveling too much.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.660
I can't miss
all these important moments,

21:35.662 --> 21:37.795
You know?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.430
You know, my daughter
can't stop talking

21:39.432 --> 21:41.632
About how much
she loves your class.
(chuckles)

21:41.634 --> 21:44.068
Come here, you.
(chuckles)

21:44.070 --> 21:47.438
Xiomara: Well, I'm not supposed
to have favorites, but...

21:47.440 --> 21:49.940
Between you and me,
she's my favorite.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.409
Mine, too.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.044
(chuckles)

21:55.681 --> 21:57.682
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, it should be known</i>

21:57.684 --> 22:00.518
<i>That frankie was having</i>
<i>the most fun she'd had since...</i>

22:00.520 --> 22:02.853
<i>Well, her last birthday.</i>

22:02.855 --> 22:04.422
(laughter)

22:04.424 --> 22:07.058
<i>You know what's not fun?</i>

22:07.060 --> 22:10.628
<i>Being the sober pregnant girl</i>
<i>in a noisy nightclub.</i>

22:17.836 --> 22:20.404
Hey, you guys want
to go grab some food?

22:20.406 --> 22:23.908
No. You, jane, dance.
No, no, no, no.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.377
Jane, let me explain.
Oh, no. You don't
have to explain anything.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.045
She's an old friend. That was
weird. It meant nothing.
No, no, no. It's fine.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.947
We're gonna go dance anyway,
so I'll see you later.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.882
Jane...
Take care! Come on,
guys, let's go dance.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.085
(whooping)

22:35.821 --> 22:37.822
Latin lover narrator:
<i>On the bright side,</i>

22:37.824 --> 22:39.824
<i>Xiomara's night was going</i>
<i>much better than expected.</i>

22:39.826 --> 22:42.693
So, I had a lot
of fun tonight.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.962
Yeah. Me, too.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.631
<i>All that remained was</i>
<i>the romantic kiss good night.</i>

22:47.633 --> 22:50.534
<i>And so,</i>
<i>with nothing in their way...</i>

22:50.536 --> 22:52.603
(rogelio coughing)

22:54.740 --> 22:58.409
I apologize, but my beautiful
date is going dancing,

22:58.411 --> 23:01.112
Whereas I must work tomorrow.

23:01.114 --> 23:04.014
Great.
Thanks for the announcement.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.683
Rogelio:
Yes.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.151
Oh, and I might need a ride home

23:07.153 --> 23:09.987
Because I had too much
normal people's wine.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.021
(chuckles)

23:11.023 --> 23:12.890
(sighs)
it's okay.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.793
I have to wake up early
with my daughter anyway.

23:17.529 --> 23:18.596
Good night.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.868
(grunts)
let's go.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.470
Petra: <i>You have to eat something</i>
<i>or you'll die.</i>

23:26.472 --> 23:29.039
I'm going to take off
your gag, but one kick...

23:37.649 --> 23:39.717
Good.

23:42.687 --> 23:44.155
Don't let him have that fork.

23:44.157 --> 23:46.757
I'm not stupid, mother.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.731
(choking)

23:56.134 --> 23:58.869
Is that peanut sauce?

23:58.871 --> 24:01.105
I don't know. I just ordered
chicken from room service.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.973
I have peanut allergy.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.010
Oh, my... Mother, go!
Get your medicine pen!

24:06.012 --> 24:07.812
My mother's allergic
to shellfish.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.680
Mother, now!

24:09.682 --> 24:11.048
We should let him die.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.583
What?

24:12.585 --> 24:14.852
He dies, our problem is over.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.520
Can't breathe.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.556
Oh, my god.
(gasping)

24:25.130 --> 24:27.765
Mother, where is it?! Now!

24:27.767 --> 24:29.800
What?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.936
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.874
Come on.
Come on.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.977
Come on. Come on!
(grunting)

24:39.979 --> 24:42.246
(gasping)

24:43.882 --> 24:45.883
(panting)

24:45.885 --> 24:47.551
Thank you.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.620
(panting)

24:54.960 --> 24:57.795
Uh, wait.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.797
I was just trying
to get some water.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.132
That's vodka.
Ah, thank you.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.970
Here you go.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.071
Thanks.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.043
Jane, come on,
this is ridiculous.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.245
You want to be with me.
Stop.

25:14.247 --> 25:17.081
I-I can't do that to michael.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.817
We were together for two years.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.051
You broke up for a reason.

25:22.053 --> 25:25.623
Look, he doesn't have to know.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.125
And I get that you don't
want to hurt his feelings,

25:28.127 --> 25:30.060
But if that's all it is,
then-then we can be discreet.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.629
That's not all it is.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.764
Then what?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.065
We're having a baby.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.234
What-what if
something goes wrong?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.004
It can get more
complicated.
It's true.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.072
It can.
But we won't let that happen

25:42.074 --> 25:44.108
Because we'll put
the baby first.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.978
And if we work...

25:47.980 --> 25:50.180
Can you imagine
anything better for a baby

25:50.182 --> 25:52.750
Than its parents
actually together?

25:52.752 --> 25:54.118
You're still married.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.053
I filed for divorce.
But petra's crazy.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.922
She filed assault charges
against you.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.757
What if she does something else?

25:59.759 --> 26:01.158
Jane, she just wants money.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.761
You say the word, I settle.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.864
We're from
different worlds.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.866
This isn't
my world, jane.

26:08.868 --> 26:11.001
Maybe it used to be,
but it's not anymore.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.671
Look, I just want
to be with you.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.740
I want to get to know you; I
want to get ready for our baby.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.175
And I get the timing
isn't perfect,

26:18.177 --> 26:20.110
But that's just
the way it is.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.112
But the baby's not waiting.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.182
Let's take advantage
of this time now,

26:25.184 --> 26:27.952
Before there are
three of us.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.156
Jane, I want
to get to know you.

26:34.626 --> 26:37.261
I'm going outside.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.197
No one has to know
we're leaving together.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.999
Just meet me.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.072
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane knew that to go</i>
<i>with rafael would be</i>

26:48.074 --> 26:50.808
<i>To undo everything she's said,</i>
<i>every signal she's given,</i>

26:50.810 --> 26:54.812
<i>Every single thing her mother</i>
<i>had warned her about.</i>

26:57.682 --> 26:59.850
<i>But there was a baby coming.</i>

26:59.852 --> 27:02.920
<i>They didn't have all the time</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

27:02.922 --> 27:05.122
(clears throat)

27:05.124 --> 27:06.957
<i>And so,</i>
<i>for the first time in her life,</i>

27:06.959 --> 27:10.628
Jane threw caution to the wind.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.799
Wait, popcorn
and fruit strips?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.801
Don't judge me.
I have cravings.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.803
Ooh, and cookies.
What's your flavor?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.038
Anything with chocolate.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.773
Good man.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.808
All right, anything
else you want?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.810
Mm-hmm.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.879
Mmm.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.083
What happened to
being discreet?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.853
We're the only people in the
popcorn and fruit strips aisle

27:35.855 --> 27:37.421
Right now.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.690
Mmm.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.365
(chuckles softly)

27:49.668 --> 27:51.769
I'm sorry I got too drunk.

27:51.771 --> 27:52.936
It's okay.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.139
Did I do anything

27:55.141 --> 27:57.441
I'm gonna be
embarrassed about tomorrow?

27:57.443 --> 28:00.010
I don't think you're gonna
remember anything tomorrow.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.313
In that case...

28:04.983 --> 28:09.787
I'm going to tell you
why I got so drunk.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.991
I was very, very jealous of...

28:13.993 --> 28:17.161
(mockingly):
Marco the soccer player.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.896
(chuckles)

28:18.898 --> 28:20.798
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Luckily,</i>

28:20.800 --> 28:24.702
<i>Xiomara knew he would remember</i>
<i>none of this tomorrow.</i>

28:33.812 --> 28:36.880
<i>Meanwhile, jane and rafael</i>
<i>would remember</i>

28:36.882 --> 28:38.916
<i>Every moment of this night.</i>

28:40.051 --> 28:41.752
Ducks?
Yes.

28:41.754 --> 28:42.486
You're scared of ducks?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.121
I am.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.756
Look, I was
nine years old.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.492
And there was an incident.
Mm-hmm.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.761
I ran out of bread, and
then they all attacked me.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.196
(laughs)

28:52.198 --> 28:53.731
Look... Okay, you...

28:53.733 --> 28:55.766
One duck might be cute,
but six or seven ducks

28:55.768 --> 28:56.767
Is terrifying.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.436
(both laughing)

28:59.438 --> 29:03.173
Your turn--
strangest fear now.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.310
Because there in the moonlight,
<i>they were having</i>

29:06.312 --> 29:08.112
<i>One of those talks.</i>

29:08.114 --> 29:10.180
<i>You know, the kind</i>
<i>that goes on forever.</i>

29:10.182 --> 29:12.449
Jane:
<i>Why'd your mom leave?</i>

29:12.451 --> 29:15.986
I don't know,
to be honest.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.288
I was four.
Mm.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.524
And I woke up the morning
after my birthday,

29:20.526 --> 29:23.994
And... She was gone.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.063
My god.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.400
What did your dad tell you?

29:30.402 --> 29:33.470
He said she was gone,

29:33.472 --> 29:37.541
She was selfish,
and that we had to move on.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.985
Least favorite food. Now.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.987
Caviar. I can't stand it.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.855
You're ridiculous that
you just said caviar right now.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.257
But I was being honest.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.892
(both laugh)

29:54.894 --> 29:56.927
Okay, most surprising
thing about you. Now.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.530
Oh, oh, uh...
I can rap.

29:59.532 --> 30:01.265
Like presents?

30:01.267 --> 30:04.868
No, like my mom was really
into <i>8 mile</i> for a hot minute.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.937
Turns out, I have a knack.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.578
â™ª you asked me to rap
so I'll ask for the map â™ª

30:14.580 --> 30:16.113
â™ª to your heart, let's take it
slow just to start... â™ª

30:16.115 --> 30:17.581
Oh, too deep. Too deep!

30:17.583 --> 30:18.849
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You asked me to rap!

30:18.851 --> 30:20.050
You have to keep going.
Your fault!

30:20.052 --> 30:21.051
Keep going! Keep
going! Keep going!

30:21.053 --> 30:23.020
No! That's all you get.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.889
Is there anything
you can't do?

30:25.891 --> 30:27.391
My turn. My question.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.892
Okay.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.594
You know, I was thinking
the name gigi was cute.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.596
Yeah, if you want her
to be a stripper.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.897
What?
(laughs)

30:33.899 --> 30:35.566
You hate the
name gigi, too?

30:35.568 --> 30:37.234
Totally hate it.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.536
Fine. Let's move on
to boys' names.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.538
No, no need.
We are having a girl.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.540
My family only has girls.

30:43.542 --> 30:44.975
My grandmother,
she had six sisters.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.277
All of them had daughters.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.146
True story.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.215
Wow.

30:53.618 --> 30:55.919
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It was, in short,</i>

30:55.921 --> 30:58.989
<i>The most romantic night ever.</i>

31:31.890 --> 31:33.891
Thank you.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.225
I appreciate.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.294
Sure.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.332
That was smart.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.967
Seeing his bracelet.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.069
You've earned his trust.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.673
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes,</i>

31:49.675 --> 31:51.942
<i>The classic</i>
<i>"poison your hostage and then</i>

31:51.944 --> 31:53.977
<i>Save him to earn his trust"</i>
<i>technique.</i>

31:53.979 --> 31:55.279
<i>Works every time.</i>

31:55.281 --> 31:58.515
I hope
the rest of your plan

31:58.517 --> 32:01.652
Works as smoothly.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.358
Wake up. Wake up.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.060
Ah, the leopard!
What? What is it?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.361
Jane's missing!

32:11.363 --> 32:13.063
What?
She didn't come
home last night!

32:13.065 --> 32:15.032
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.967
I've called
frankie, lina, luca.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.235
She's young, xiomara.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.503
No, no, you don't
understand.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.505
Jane always comes
home or calls.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.707
Hi, frankie? Um, it's xo.

32:23.709 --> 32:27.277
I-I'm sorry to call you again,
but have you heard anything?

32:27.279 --> 32:30.280
Okay. Thanks.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.015
What about michael?

32:32.017 --> 32:33.116
M-maybe she's with him.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.085
B-but I shouldn't call him.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.720
You know what, I'm
just gonna call him.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.956
I-I've called
everyone else.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.958
Okay. I'm gonna tweet

32:40.960 --> 32:44.061
My 6.3 million followers with
the hashtag "please find jane."

32:44.063 --> 32:45.228
Uh, michael?

32:45.230 --> 32:47.197
Xo? Is everything all right?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.699
Um, is jane there,

32:48.701 --> 32:50.567
By any chance?

32:50.569 --> 32:53.303
Um, no, why?

32:53.305 --> 32:55.105
Um, I'm sorry, I just...
I'm a little worried.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.974
She-she didn't
come home last night, and...

32:56.976 --> 32:58.108
Oh.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.509
You know jane,

32:59.511 --> 33:01.044
She doesn't do this.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.548
Um, yeah, you should...
You should, uh,

33:04.550 --> 33:07.451
You should check with rafael.
What?

33:07.453 --> 33:10.120
Yeah. I think they were
planning on meeting up.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.722
I'm sorry.

33:11.724 --> 33:12.756
Yeah. So, anyway,

33:12.758 --> 33:14.291
Um, I got to go.

33:14.293 --> 33:17.094
Take care, xo.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.333
1,454 retweets in three seconds.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.035
Do not worry, xiomara.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.370
My fans are on
the hunt for jane.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.038
(gasps)

33:28.040 --> 33:29.539
Oh! Oh, oh!
Wake up, wake up!

33:29.541 --> 33:31.675
I'm gonna be late!
I got to get to work!

33:31.677 --> 33:33.677
Ay! Oh, oh.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.145
Jane:
Mom, I know. I'm so sorry. I...

33:35.147 --> 33:36.780
(school bell ringing)
yes, I fell asleep.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.116
But, yeah, I'm fine
and I'm at school

33:39.118 --> 33:42.119
And I will call you later. Bye.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.559
Miss villanueva?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.560
Sister margaret.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.661
Good morning.
How are you?

33:51.663 --> 33:52.796
What are you thinking,

33:52.798 --> 33:54.731
Coming to school
dressed like this?

33:54.733 --> 33:57.100
I... Overslept.

33:57.102 --> 34:00.103
And I was late, but I have
a sweater inside and...

34:00.105 --> 34:02.072
We do have a strict code of
conduct, and this behavior

34:02.074 --> 34:03.607
Cannot be tolerated.

34:03.609 --> 34:06.143
And as for your future here,

34:06.145 --> 34:08.345
I'm just not comfortable

34:08.347 --> 34:12.215
With teachers who arrive
on campus like this.

34:16.421 --> 34:18.588
Would it make you
more comfortable

34:18.590 --> 34:22.325
If I gave out a few hugs?

34:22.327 --> 34:26.196
That would certainly help.

34:34.138 --> 34:36.139
How did you get in here?

34:36.141 --> 34:37.474
My husband owns the hotel.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.210
What do you want?

34:40.212 --> 34:43.180
To help you take down rafael.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.115
I have information
that will ruin him.

34:45.117 --> 34:48.251
What's in it for you?

34:50.221 --> 34:52.122
Money.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.790
$350,000.

34:59.797 --> 35:03.433
Now, see... Last time,
you set me up.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.569
So why should I trust you?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.270
Because I'm naked.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.874
Record us.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.209
You can expose it
and humiliate me

35:12.211 --> 35:14.711
Any time you want.

35:14.713 --> 35:19.249
Ruin my life with one
click of a button.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.152
I'll never be able to show
my face in miami society again.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.255
I'm interested.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.157
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Was he ever.</i>

35:30.595 --> 35:31.895
(sighs)

35:33.598 --> 35:35.332
You must be rafael
solano, are you not?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.467
I am.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.735
Who are you?

35:38.737 --> 35:40.237
I am jane's father.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.139
Oh, uh...

35:42.141 --> 35:44.174
Oh, uh, it's nice
to meet you, sir.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.642
I wish I could
say the same.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.912
Jane's mother was
worried all night.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.414
Oh, I am so sorry.
We-we just kind of...

35:51.416 --> 35:54.417
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

35:54.419 --> 35:55.652
I know your game.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.287
I used to be
just like you.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.856
Ridiculously good-looking,
with charisma, with swagger,

35:59.858 --> 36:01.525
Notching girls
onto my belt.

36:01.527 --> 36:02.726
No, that's-that's not
what's happening...

36:02.728 --> 36:04.828
I have had sex
with a lot of women.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.796
Way more than
you, I'm sure!

36:08.766 --> 36:11.301
I am sure
that that's true.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.937
Mm-hmm. But jane
is different.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.173
Jane is special.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.208
Remember that.

36:18.210 --> 36:21.845
Or face the consequences.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.315
Uh... Uh, got it.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.624
Jane?

36:34.626 --> 36:37.360
I think I just met your father.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.236
I want you to know how much
this means to me.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.305
Thank you.

36:50.608 --> 36:51.875
My pleasure.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.743
(laughs)

36:53.745 --> 36:57.414
Of course, I don't have access
to the money yet, but...

37:00.718 --> 37:03.353
I'm not a solano.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.322
So, what?
You lied to me?

37:05.324 --> 37:07.524
Think of it as
a deferred payment plan.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.659
Once I take control
of the hotel,

37:09.661 --> 37:11.561
You'll get your money.

37:13.965 --> 37:17.434
So what's this information
that's gonna ruin rafael?

37:31.816 --> 37:34.251
What the hell were you
thinking, yelling at rafael?

37:34.253 --> 37:36.486
What were you thinking?
You didn't call.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.854
I was out.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.356
My phone died,
I lost track of time.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.824
Exactly. Which is not like you.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.025
See, rafael is already
a bad influence on you.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.361
You're being
ridiculous.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.729
No, I'm not. You just
don't want to hear it.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.430
Because you're wrong,
mom, all right?

37:47.432 --> 37:49.266
He's totally different;
he's a great guy.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.301
I just don't have
a good feeling.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.271
Well, you're not exactly
the greatest judge of men.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.272
Hey.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.607
And you're not me, jane.

37:57.609 --> 38:01.578
You make smart choices,
sensible choices.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.013
Exactly. Because
I was always scared

38:03.015 --> 38:04.347
Of repeating
your mistakes.

38:04.349 --> 38:06.383
And, mom,

38:06.385 --> 38:07.851
I'm just realizing,
because of that,

38:07.853 --> 38:10.520
I've been afraid to take risks.

38:10.522 --> 38:11.955
Real risks.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.391
You've been smart.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.393
I've been safe.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.328
And I'm gonna be a mom.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.929
And moms put their kids first.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.765
You know that
better than anyone.

38:23.367 --> 38:28.071
So this is my last chance I get
to follow my heart.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.773
Do what I want.

38:29.775 --> 38:31.074
And, yeah,

38:31.076 --> 38:32.709
Maybe the timing isn't perfect,

38:32.711 --> 38:34.444
But I want to be with rafael.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.680
He's a good guy.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.319
I hope you're right.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.953
I am.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.437
You can't protect her
from everything, xiomara.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.939
You did a fantastic job
raising a daughter

39:02.941 --> 39:05.408
Who was gifted
with extraordinary dna.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.912
At some point,
you have to trust that you--

39:08.914 --> 39:12.482
And I--
prepared her well.

39:14.652 --> 39:17.120
(knocking)
must be my driver.

39:21.792 --> 39:23.393
Hi.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.463
I just came by to drop
off my daughter's fee.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.697
Six more classes.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.733
It's not due for a week.

39:29.735 --> 39:33.069
Well, I know. I-I just
didn't want to... Forget.

39:35.506 --> 39:36.906
(laughs)

39:36.908 --> 39:38.908
I also wanted to
ask you something.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.411
(laughing)
rogelio.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.146
Good to see you.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.516
Jane needed to talk
to him, so...

39:46.518 --> 39:47.751
Gotcha.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.588
Please?

39:56.460 --> 39:58.161
Please, can you leave?

39:58.163 --> 39:59.929
Oh!

39:59.931 --> 40:01.931
Sorry, I thought you were asking
my permission to speak.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.100
I'm very sorry.
I'm just gonna go, okay?

40:04.102 --> 40:05.902
Good day, marco.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.003
Good day.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.118
Okay, I've given it a lot of
thought, and I don't want

40:22.120 --> 40:23.586
To tell the captain
about the drug shipment

40:23.588 --> 40:25.889
Until after we make the bust.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.891
If we tell him,
he's gonna call in the dea,

40:27.893 --> 40:29.826
They'll take all the credit.

40:29.828 --> 40:31.828
And if we don't, w-we violate,
like, a hundred regulations.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.196
Oh, come on. Since when
are you a boy scout?

40:33.198 --> 40:34.931
Forget it, nadine.
It's not happening!

40:34.933 --> 40:36.065
What is it, michael?
What is going on with you?

40:36.067 --> 40:37.667
You can't shut your mouth

40:37.669 --> 40:39.436
For more than five seconds!

40:39.438 --> 40:40.904
I bet you'd like to try.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.872
You don't want
to take that bet.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.744
What are you
gonna do, huh?

41:25.517 --> 41:26.683
Dad, not right now.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.750
You're fired.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.752
What?

41:29.754 --> 41:31.020
Why?

41:42.100 --> 41:44.033
I'm on my way to the airport.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.069
I have to go to mexico city.
