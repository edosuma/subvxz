What's this one?

01:06.700 --> 01:09.401
Does it matter?

01:09.403 --> 01:10.969
Oh, I'm just curious.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.039
Thief.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.174
A stupid, fat thief.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.646
Anyone care to
say a prayer?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.317
We'll leave him to you.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.120
Let's get a drink.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.288
[laughs]

01:41.535 --> 01:44.035
I'll do better

it's quite small.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.448

And I have
no doubt you will.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.519
And it's surprisingly powerful.
I've tested it.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.522
Let me see.
Oh, william.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.524
What should I look at?

02:40.728 --> 02:43.962
-Um, today's headline.
-No. Really?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.066
Oh, my goodness.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.601
Yes, I can--

02:49.670 --> 02:51.536
Oh, my goodness.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.138
What is it?

02:59.747 --> 03:00.679
Oh.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.421
Escaped?

03:09.423 --> 03:10.989
I thought he would have
been released by now.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.358
I would have
thought so as well, sir.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.827
Why would he escape now,
after so many years?

03:15.896 --> 03:17.629
Especially someone
like giles.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.165
Never been a more
straight-laced bugger than him.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.834
Well, he did bury a body
in a police station, sir.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.904
Oh, yeah.
There was that. Huh.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.506
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to take the day

03:28.576 --> 03:30.242
To look into this.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.376
You're going to kingston?

If I catch
the 9:10 am out of union

Ogden: How much time
do you have left to serve?

03:48.495 --> 03:51.530
Three months.
If I last.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.732
We'll do our best
to ensure

03:53.867 --> 03:55.734
You're properly
treated, mr. Giles.

03:55.803 --> 03:59.571
In fact, we'll see if we
can do even better than that.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.277
Thank you.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.013
Okay.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.020
Conductor:
Arriving, kingston station.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.754
Kingston.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.694
Exploratory surgery?
For what?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.164
My husband believes I may
have damaged my womanly parts.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.500
Your reproductive organs?

04:28.635 --> 04:30.435
We've been trying
for months.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.104
But you haven't
conceived.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.039
He's in medical school and he's
heard that vigorous activity

04:35.075 --> 04:36.908
Can lead to
permanent damage.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.711
What kind of activity?

04:39.846 --> 04:42.013
I've been playing
a game with my friends.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.850
We call it mintonette,
though some call it volleyball.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.251
Have you heard of it?

04:46.253 --> 04:47.485
No.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.856
It's like badminton, only you
use your hands and a ball.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.590
Oh.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.727
Well, then I suspect your
womanly parts are just fine.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.729
Do you menstruate
regularly?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.998
Every month, yes.
Like clockwork.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.934
Well, the problem could be
your husband's sperm count.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.069
Has he ever been tested?

05:04.138 --> 05:06.538
No! He doesn't
believe in onanism.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.406
I see.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.808
And yet he
would consider

05:09.810 --> 05:11.876
Subjecting you to
unnecessary surgery.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.817
Warden: He picked
the lock to the morgue...

05:18.819 --> 05:20.519
Pried open the casket
and pulled the lid down

05:20.654 --> 05:22.821
By means of an
improvised ratchet.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.823
Giles was set to be
released last year.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.890
What happened?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.625
There was an incident
with a fellow inmate.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.693
One of the clan na gael?

05:28.729 --> 05:29.828
No.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.430
A condemned man by
the name of jimmy mortimer

05:31.565 --> 05:33.231
Attacked mr. Giles
in the common.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.100
Jimmy mortimer.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.901
Killed a young woman
a few years back.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.638
Ah, yes, and then escaped
on his way to prison.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.773
Yes, he was
recaptured last year.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.508
When he set eyes on giles,
he attacked him.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.843
They fought.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.712
And for this giles received
more time on his sentence?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.313
Well, he attempted to strangle
the young man, detective.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.982
He was lucky to
get three years.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.717
Still, it was
disheartening.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.652
He'd been a model
prisoner to that point.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.920
Samuel:
No!

05:55.922 --> 05:58.256
No bird dogs sniffing one
another's hind ends.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.125
I want people out there
with bloodhounds,

06:00.127 --> 06:02.260
A pack of them with
their noses to the ground.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.928
I want 'em to trace
his every move.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.399
Detective samuel,
this is detective murdoch.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.200
-How do you do?
-Charmed.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.269
We have a credible
sighting here,

06:11.305 --> 06:13.472
Four miles west
of pitts ferry.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.940
You think he's
gone down river?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.942
'course he's gone down river.
He's heading to america.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.943
It's just a question
of where he's crossing.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.613
That's assuming giles
is indeed seeking his freedom.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.952
Well, I don't think he
executed this brazen escape

06:27.087 --> 06:28.353
To go fishing,
detective...

06:28.488 --> 06:30.889
Murdoch.
Toronto constabulary.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.592
And your
interest in this is?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.361
The same as yours.
I wish to find mr. Giles.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.896
Have at it.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.166
-Do you have horses?
-Two in the stables.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.968
I'm commandeering them.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.836
Do you have an office
with a telephone?

06:44.971 --> 06:47.572
You can use
the one down the hall.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.011
So, detective,
how can I assist you?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.380
I was hoping to see
mr. Giles' correspondence

06:55.515 --> 06:57.115
Over the past year.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.316
I'll have it
brought to my office.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.451
Anything else?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.453
I'd like to speak
with jimmy mortimer.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.920
I'll arrange that.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.592
Sure, I attacked him.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.393
Not many of us get
the chance to punch out

07:09.430 --> 07:10.995
The bastard
who put us here.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.998
You blame him
for your conviction?

07:14.133 --> 07:16.268
He planted my knife
where they found her body.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.537
Chief constable giles?

07:19.539 --> 07:21.639
That's who we're
talking about, isn't it?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.942
I'd have killed him
if I could have.

07:24.011 --> 07:27.045
Instead he got
the better of you?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.814
Bastard's
tougher than he looks.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.616
He grabbed my leg
as I was kicking him.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.018
Next I knew, I was on
the ground in a chokehold.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.155
You want to know
what's funny?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.024
You want to know
what mattered most

07:39.026 --> 07:41.426
As he was squeezing
the life outta me?

07:41.428 --> 07:43.828
He wanted to know
how I escaped.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.697
Can you believe that?

07:45.699 --> 07:49.166
Seven years inside
and he's still a copper first.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.105
Ogden:
You're closing your practice?

07:54.241 --> 07:56.374
I don't feel I can
represent my clients

07:56.410 --> 07:57.909
In my current state.

07:58.044 --> 08:00.044
What's wrong?

08:01.181 --> 08:03.180
I just feel this...

08:03.217 --> 08:05.717
This overwhelming
anxiety.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.186
Some days I can't
even leave my house.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.254
What does george say?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.155
Oh, he always says
the right thing.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.526
I fear he'll soon
start to pity me,

08:14.661 --> 08:16.227
And I can't bear that.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.064
I know you've
practiced in this field,

08:19.199 --> 08:21.733
And I thought you might
help me snap out of it.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.201
I have studied this,
effie, but more importantly

08:24.238 --> 08:26.137
I've... I've been
through it myself.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.339
You have?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.341
Years ago.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.543
I thought that
I would bounce back,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.812
But there were days
I couldn't get out of bed.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.546
William was
despairing.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.082
That's exactly
how I feel.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.352
I was always
so strong.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.887
Now I feel as if
a hole's opened beneath me.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.822
You were kidnapped
and left to die.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.358
It's left a very
deep impression.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.228
I'm afraid there's no
snapping out of it.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.829
You seem fine now.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.097
It took time.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.699
And effort.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.036
You need to fight the urge
to shrink away from the world.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.873
What on earth kind
of game is that?

09:05.779 --> 09:06.911
Oh!

09:06.914 --> 09:09.080
I think they
call it volleyball.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.149
Is that louise cherry?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.121
It's a ball, not a bullet.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.056
You're supposed to knock
it back, not duck!

09:20.127 --> 09:22.127
Fine, leave.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.128
You were just
taking up space, anyway!

09:24.164 --> 09:26.831
Really? Is that how you
plan on winning games?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.336
What?

09:32.472 --> 09:36.273
It appears your teammates
have abandoned you.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.743
They were useless.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.146
Perhaps we should
give it a try?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.413
We?

09:42.449 --> 09:46.450
Another thing that can help
is vigorous exercise.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.288
Have you ever played before?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.890
Sure it can't be
that hard to pick up.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.162
-How do we do it?
-Stand there.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.999
Is this everything?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.836
We don't keep a record
of any outgoing correspondence.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.838
There isn't much here.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.707
He didn't have
many friends.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.908
Well, he once did.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.578
He used to move in
fairly high circles.

10:13.713 --> 10:14.645
Now he's...

10:14.681 --> 10:17.014
A homosexual who
buried a body.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.851
Do we know who "j" is?

10:20.853 --> 10:25.390
I'm afraid there's no
return address on that one.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.658
What does it say?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.259
Nothing of note.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.128
Just an account
of the recent weather.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.430
Take as much time
as you need.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.430
Warden?

11:05.565 --> 11:06.631
Warden:
Yes, detective.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.566
A rowboat has been
reported stolen

11:08.602 --> 11:11.035
From a boat house
just west of howe island.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.504
You think he's
rowing across?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.372
Not the whole river,
he would be too exposed.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.373
I expect he's rowing
across the strait.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.975
He's going to leg it
over wolfe island

11:18.011 --> 11:19.778
And he's going to swim
the rest of the way.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.579
You've notified
the american authorities?

11:21.581 --> 11:24.115
They have mounted patrols
from clayton to saint vincent.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.252
They have two steamboats on
either side of carlton island.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.453
They're going to give him
a nice, warm welcome.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.456
Unless it's a ruse.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.660
A ruse?

11:35.729 --> 11:38.329
I suspect you'll find
a scuttled rowboat nearby.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.064
I believe he's
staying in canada.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.332
Oh, that's right.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.601
You don't believe
he's seeking his freedom.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.136
You follow that theory.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.104
I'm going to follow
where he actually went.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.476
As you know, an escaped
felon can be shot on sight.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.544
He gets one warning
and then it's bullets.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.680
Stay out of my way.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.954
Detective, you wanted
to tell me something.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.524
Just that my
inquiry here is complete.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.369
Brackenreid: You were right
to keep it to yourself.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.105
-I know that bugger.
-Detective samuel?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.707
He was at station house one
in the early 90's.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.042
He was as relentless as giles,
but more ruthless.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.045
Giles' best hope is
that you find him first.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.247
Good to know.
Well, this is tate street.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.916
How do you know it's
tate street, toronto?

12:31.985 --> 12:33.251
There must be tate streets
everywhere, murdoch.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.986
Just following
my instincts.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.655
But the note
did specify a coal bin.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.591
Huh. Why do I ever
doubt you, murdoch?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.131
It's empty.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.334
Giles must have
got here first.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.235
That was my only clue.

12:52.773 --> 12:53.938
Brackenreid:
Who sent the letter?

12:53.974 --> 12:57.208
Someone who signed off
with the initial j.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.411
Think, murdoch.
Who would stay loyal to giles?

13:00.413 --> 13:02.613
Who would he trust
after all these years?

13:03.784 --> 13:06.383
Hodge. John hodge.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.159
Tom, william!

13:15.228 --> 13:16.628
I'm just closing up,
I'm afraid.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.629
We're not here for a drink,
neil walker.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.299
Murdoch:
Tell us about 14 tate street.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.701
We know it was you
who wrote the letter, hodge.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.037
What was in
the coal bin?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.575
Just a pair of
dungarees and money.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.577
That was it, I swear.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.780
I haven't seen
or talked to him.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.648
Where's the letter?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.484
I burned it.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.587
You're a terrible liar, hodge.
You always were.

13:42.656 --> 13:46.991
Hodge, the man that's after
giles will kill him

13:46.993 --> 13:48.526
If we don't
find him first.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.461
Where is the letter?

14:09.315 --> 14:10.748
Brackenreid:
The bedford park hotel.

14:10.817 --> 14:11.949
That's up on yonge street.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.052
If you hear from him,
let us know.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.758
Murdoch:
Police!

14:26.833 --> 14:28.633
Bed hasn't been slept in.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.635
Maybe he got scared off.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.306
Sir, would you trust your life
to john hodge's ability

14:35.375 --> 14:36.707
To keep a secret?

14:36.743 --> 14:38.509
Not bloody likely.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.345
[sighs]

14:41.414 --> 14:43.648
It would be an excellent way to
find out who was following you.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.483
Do you think
he's watching us?

14:48.722 --> 14:49.988
Sir, please turn
off the lights.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.076
It's giles.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.378
Damn it!

15:35.301 --> 15:37.101
This is the room.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.502
Mm.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.438
Certainly left
in a hurry.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.441
Brackenreid:
Murdoch, look at these.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.945
Page from
a telephone directory.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.914
He was looking
for someone, then.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.451
That's an evidence log
from our city morgue.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.120
The morgue?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.821
What's he bloody after?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.396
Mrs. Hart.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.532
Detective.
What can I do for you?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.802
A man I'm seeking broke
into your morgue last night.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.537
I saw no
indication of that.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.138
He likely picked the lock.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.809
And stole this
from one of your files.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.144
I need to know
which file.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.945
A knife wound
to the heart.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.181
You don't see
too many of those.

16:24.250 --> 16:27.285
There's no date,
so it may go back a ways.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.620
I'll take a look.
It shouldn't be too long.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.321
Thank you.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.228
Murdoch, they're putting
these up all around town.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.296
They know he's in toronto.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.098
Better keep
his head down.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.533
Henry,
I need your assistance.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.169
Look up every name
on this page.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.305
Who they are,
where they work,

16:47.307 --> 16:48.906
Pull any files
we may have on them,

16:48.975 --> 16:51.442
But do not contact
them directly.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.443
Certainly, sir.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.577
There are just
a couple of things

16:53.646 --> 16:55.312
I need to take care of first.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.249
What am I looking for?

16:58.318 --> 17:01.185
Any connection they may have
to former chief inspector giles,

17:01.187 --> 17:02.587
However tangential.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.788
Sir.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.623
Ah, mrs. Hart.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.725
Mrs. Hart, what have you?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.660
It was from
this file here.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.730
Pearl wallace.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.598
Pearl wallace?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.801
Wasn't she the young girl
that was murdered

17:16.803 --> 17:17.801
A few years back?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.003
Some street thug did it.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.938
Jimmy mortimer.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.507
Was anything else
missing from this file?

17:23.576 --> 17:24.641
I looked up the list.

17:24.677 --> 17:25.943
The only other thing
that was missing

17:26.012 --> 17:27.144
Was a sketch
of the murder weapon

17:27.213 --> 17:28.746
Taken from the wound impression.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.948
Thank you.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.685
Why is giles looking into
the murder of pearl wallace?

17:34.687 --> 17:37.688
Sir, jimmy mortimer is the man
who was convicted of the crime.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.756
He had an altercation
with giles

17:39.793 --> 17:41.558
A little over
a year ago in prison,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.760
Which is why giles'
sentence was extended.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.129
Coincidence?

17:45.198 --> 17:47.164
Not bloody likely.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.166
Giles used to pal around
with the girl's father,

17:49.302 --> 17:50.468
Fenton wallace.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.769
Well, well, well.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.138
Gerard samuel.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.177
Murdoch: Detective samuel.
You've come to toronto.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.044
We found a rowboat
scuttled offshore,

18:01.081 --> 18:02.446
As you suspected.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.048
Clearly, he wanted us to
think he'd crossed over

18:04.050 --> 18:05.450
To the american side.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.652
He probably scuttled the boat
knowing that you'd find it

18:07.787 --> 18:09.520
Thinking he was
still on this side,

18:09.655 --> 18:11.054
When in fact,
he swam across.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.723
Yeah. That's very clever.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.325
Giles is nothing
if not clever.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.794
But we've had reports
of sightings this morning.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.596
Where?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.265
One at the docks,
a man in a grey sack suit,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.134
And one at castle frank,
a man in dungarees,

18:23.136 --> 18:25.102
Both match the description.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.208
Giles has been
seen in toronto.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.144
He made contact with
a man named john hodge.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.481
That's very clever.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.885
Bedford park hotel.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.753
He had cleared out
by the time we got there,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.389
But perhaps you'll find
something we missed.

18:45.391 --> 18:46.691
That's very good,
detective.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.628
Keep me apprised
of anything else you find out.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.833
That'll keep 'em occupied.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.035
So, you're heading
to castle frank?

18:58.037 --> 19:00.037
Well, sir, we aren't
going to find giles

19:00.073 --> 19:01.572
By looking where he's been.

19:01.707 --> 19:04.308
We have to predict
where he's going to be.

19:04.443 --> 19:07.111
I'm going to have a word
with fenton wallace.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.545
Carry on, murdoch.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.982
Fenton:
Percy giles.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.850
Haven't heard
that name in years.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.919
He's made no attempt
to contact you?

19:15.054 --> 19:16.520
Oh, heavens, no.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.055
We were friends once,

19:18.091 --> 19:20.725
But he turned into
a rather unsavoury character,

19:20.727 --> 19:22.226
As you know.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.461
So, you have no idea
why he may be looking into

19:24.497 --> 19:25.863
Your daughter's murder?

19:25.865 --> 19:28.432
Pearl? What could she
have to do with this?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.800
I'm afraid I don't know.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.203
Perhaps it's
connected to the man

19:32.205 --> 19:33.870
Who was convicted
of the murder?

19:33.907 --> 19:35.038
Jimmy.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.908
You know him by his
christian name?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.176
-He used to work for us.
-Worst mistake of my life.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.746
He became obsessed
with pearl.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.148
Sadly,
she toyed with him,

19:44.283 --> 19:47.051
Let him believe his
affections were reciprocated.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.186
As if he was
worthy of her.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.322
She just wanted to
make whitney jealous.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.756
Whitney?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.193
Jacobson. Her fiancé.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.527
Fenton:
Yes, fine lad. Good family.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.264
Jimmy mortimer killed
my daughter, pearl.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.267
And killed her mother, too,
as far as I'm concerned.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.070
Mother had consumption.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.006
She went downhill
quickly when pearl died.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.308
Fenton :The only time I want
to hear that name again

20:11.344 --> 20:13.311
Is when they announce
his hanging.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.580
Until then,
if it's all the same, detective,

20:16.583 --> 20:19.784
I really don't want to
talk about this anymore.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.298
Sir, I went through
all the names,

20:34.434 --> 20:35.666
As you requested.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.200
There were quite a few,
as you know.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.536
Did you find anything?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.671
Well, sir, I noticed one
was listed as a police guard,

20:40.806 --> 20:43.474
So I called all the agencies
and he's not currently employed.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.810
But seven years ago, he worked
for regency guard services.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.480
They provide guards for
prison transfers and such.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.215
Is there an end to
this story, higgins?

20:51.217 --> 20:53.350
Well, sir, he was
the guard in charge

20:53.386 --> 20:54.619
When jimmy mortimer escaped.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.820
Brackenreid:
There's that name again.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.722
Allen suddon, sir.
Clarence avenue.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.760
In his altercation
with mortimer,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.395
Giles kept asking
about that escape.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.700
Giles was seen here.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.970
Allen suddon
lives here.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.106
He's making his way
through the ravine.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.774
Of course,
he'd have to.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.976
Right.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.913
Giles was last seen in
castle frank an hour ago.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.614
Well, you'd better
cracking then, murdoch.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.723
Julia.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.658
I was just on my way out.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.527
We're here to see
the inspector, actually.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.329
Oh!

21:38.331 --> 21:40.664
Well, then I'll
see you at dinner.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.603
I don't know why
this is necessary.

21:46.605 --> 21:49.473
It's necessary for our
collective sanity, miss cherry.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.208
Inspector.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.810
What can I do
for you, ladies?

21:52.812 --> 21:55.346
We've decided to form
a team to play volleyball.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.249
It's a new game.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.350
There's a ball. There's a net.
They want a coach.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.552
Are you up for it?

22:01.621 --> 22:03.487
I'm not too familiar
with the, uh--

22:03.622 --> 22:05.756
Inspector, we need you.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.291
We would never have
won the roller races

22:08.328 --> 22:10.094
If it weren't
for your support.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.097
That is true.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.364
[knock on the door]

22:20.039 --> 22:22.840
Hello. I'm detective william
murdoch, toronto constabulary.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.175
I'm looking for
an allen suddon.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.044
You and everybody else!

22:27.046 --> 22:29.346
You're seven
years too late.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.855
Have you seen
this man, by chance?

22:39.492 --> 22:41.525
Yeah. He's in my kitchen.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.661
[door opens in the distance]

23:03.149 --> 23:05.483
I beg of you, murdoch.
Let me finish what I started.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.960
Jimmy mortimer escaped
while his guard

23:16.996 --> 23:19.630
Was supposedly
inspecting a broken axle.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.432
-Supposedly?
-The guard was paid off.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.968
According to his wife,
he came home with 1000 dollars.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.570
A thousand dollars?

23:26.639 --> 23:29.840
In crisp, four-dollar bills
from the toronto bank.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.709
But who could have
paid such a fortune?

23:32.779 --> 23:34.478
No one in his family? Friends?

23:34.613 --> 23:36.780
I intended to lead an
investigation into the matter.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.582
Why didn't you?

23:38.584 --> 23:40.517
You arrested me.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.421
After that,
I forgot all about it.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.623
Until he attacked you.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.460
He accused me of planting
his knife at the scene.

23:49.595 --> 23:52.462
I hadn't, of course, but it
was the one bit of evidence

23:52.498 --> 23:54.131
Of which I was unsure.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.066
And for this you
broke out of jail?

23:56.068 --> 23:57.401
If mr. Mortimer's
innocent

23:57.536 --> 23:59.203
And hangs for a crime
he didn't commit,

23:59.272 --> 24:01.672
It would be
entirely my fault.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.874
You felt you
had been biased.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.476
I disliked the lad,
detective.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.877
I wanted to convict him

24:07.012 --> 24:08.545
And I was blinded
to the possibility

24:08.581 --> 24:10.080
Of evidence
to the contrary.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.749
Why break out of prison?

24:12.785 --> 24:15.218
Why not simply
ask me to help you?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.687
On what evidence?

24:17.723 --> 24:21.425
All I have is an unease,
as deep as my bones,

24:21.427 --> 24:25.629
That a terrible injustice
is about to unfold.

24:25.631 --> 24:29.766
Though I suppose
I am asking you now.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.304
How much time do we have?

24:33.306 --> 24:34.972
Three days until he hangs.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.141
Right.
I'll help you.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.708
Giles:
Thank you, detective.

24:40.579 --> 24:41.978
Samuel:
Ma'am?

24:42.014 --> 24:43.514
Hello!

24:44.617 --> 24:45.549
Sorry to trouble you, ma'am.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.118
We are trying to locate
an escaped felon.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.987
Have you perchance
seen this man?

24:51.023 --> 24:52.723
We have reason to believe

24:52.792 --> 24:54.525
That he may have
come through this way.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.327
Suddon: What took you?
They went out back.

24:56.462 --> 24:57.594
They?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.796
The man you're after
and the man who's after him.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.446
Hurry.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.507
This way.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.254
Head downstream.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.855
Wait for me
at the river.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.344
Good one!

26:20.413 --> 26:21.645
For crying out loud.

26:21.780 --> 26:22.946
Do you not know
where your hands end?

26:22.949 --> 26:24.214
Cherry, it's just a game!

26:24.350 --> 26:26.483
Hide and seek is a game.
This is a competition.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.819
To be honest, I don't
know where my hands end.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.888
Ladies, ladies!
Ball, please, miss cherry.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.356
Right, then, ladies.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.958
I think I've got
a handle on this.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.627
Basically, it's just tennis
with a big fat ball

26:36.762 --> 26:38.228
And no racket.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.330
What we need is a man
up front by the net,

26:40.366 --> 26:41.498
Taller the better.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.833
That would be you,
miss newsome.

26:42.968 --> 26:44.701
Right.

26:44.737 --> 26:47.170
Brackenreid: Just knock down
anything that comes over.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.905
At the back we need
a powerful server,

26:48.941 --> 26:50.374
Someone who can
serve the ball

26:50.443 --> 26:51.942
As far into
their side as possible.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.677
That would be you,
miss cherry.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.979
Doctor ogden,
just float around.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.048
Right then, ladies.
Let's play ball!

27:13.833 --> 27:15.432
Brilliant!

27:17.469 --> 27:19.536
Ogden: William,
I'm so glad you're home.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.338
I've discovered
the most wonderful game!

27:21.407 --> 27:24.341
Julia, there's something
I need to tell you...

27:26.379 --> 27:27.611
Ogden:
Mr. Giles.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.216
This is what you
retrieved from the morgue?

27:33.218 --> 27:35.753
It's a sketch dr. Grace
made of what she deduced

27:35.888 --> 27:38.555
Was the murder weapon
based on the wound.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.891
It appears to show
the tip missing.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.559
Yes, I can see that.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.562
It's possible that the tip
broke off the blade

27:45.698 --> 27:47.497
When the knife
hit the sternum.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.299
Dr. Grace never found it.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.634
[knock at the door]

27:50.636 --> 27:52.336
Well, that will
be the inspector.

27:53.539 --> 27:55.239
Ogden: If the tip
dislodged in a chamber,

27:55.374 --> 27:56.974
It could have been swept
into the aorta

27:56.976 --> 28:00.310
And traveled quite a distance
in the heart's final beats.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.046
In which case it should
still be in her body.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.717
Yes, but I wouldn't rely on
a sketch of a wound impression.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.053
Unless the putative weapon
were missing a tip,

28:09.188 --> 28:10.454
It's simply not convincing.

28:10.589 --> 28:11.521
Excuse me.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.257
Courtesy
of stationhouse three.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.126
Thank you, inspector.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.628
Any word on detective
samuel's investigation?

28:18.698 --> 28:21.265
Funnily enough,
he asked the same about you.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.266
Ah! So, he's
off the trail, then.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.469
Perhaps. But he won't
be off it for long.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.270
Giles:
Here we are.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.340
Mortimer's knife,
with his fingermarks

28:30.376 --> 28:34.611
And as you can see,
the tip is very much intact.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.613
Ogden:
And what is this?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.681
Oh! That would be
pearl's diary.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.417
It was found
in her purse.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.119
The last page
has been removed.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.653
Presumably by the killer.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.223
I assume you've looked through
it for any possible clues?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.225
Of course, but it was mostly
the kind of romantic nonsense

28:48.360 --> 28:50.627
One expects these days
from young women.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.631
"my bounty is as
boundless as the sea.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.834
My love as deep,
the more I give to thee."

28:56.969 --> 28:58.302
That's from
romeo and juliet.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.204
Precisely my point.

29:00.339 --> 29:03.640
She was about to marry, so
I suppose it's to be expected.

29:03.676 --> 29:06.043
And I assume they've included
the witness statements?

29:06.045 --> 29:07.377
Yes, family mostly.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.513
Mr. Mortimer was clearly
obsessed with a woman

29:09.648 --> 29:11.582
Who was in love
with another man.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.716
Well, there's your
motivation then.

29:12.851 --> 29:15.052
As obvious as it was
lacking for everyone else.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.486
You think he was innocent?

29:16.522 --> 29:19.323
I honestly don't know
what to think, inspector.

29:19.458 --> 29:23.026
Hold it.
Who was she in love with?

29:23.028 --> 29:25.328
Her fiance, of course:
Whitney jacobson.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.464
Well, he's not romeo.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.266
She calls whitney
the "prince of cats."

29:30.302 --> 29:32.936
Tybalt!

29:32.938 --> 29:35.939
Romeo's rival and the man
she did not want.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.274
How did you miss that?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.943
I'm afraid my
tastes are modern.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.279
I'm not so well-versed
in the classics.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.980
So who's romeo then?

29:44.115 --> 29:46.616
Well, the man she's not
permitted to marry, of course.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.585
Jimmy mortimer.

29:48.720 --> 29:51.922
All along it was in front
of me and I didn't see it.

29:52.057 --> 29:53.824
If I was looking
for motivation,

29:53.893 --> 29:55.826
I'd be looking
at the fiance.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.328
Jealousy. Yes! Of course!

29:58.463 --> 30:00.297
We need to talk to
whitney jacobson.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.032
He's not back in
town until tomorrow.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.500
Then in light of
this new evidence,

30:03.635 --> 30:05.435
I say we make use
of the darkness

30:05.437 --> 30:07.904
And pay a visit to
the scene of the crime.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.111
Murdoch,
you should arm yourself.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.246
You're bringing
a fugitive in, remember?

30:16.381 --> 30:17.915
I don't think he's
likely to run, sir.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.317
Not for giles.
For show.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.053
Doctor.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.263
Please be careful.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.703
This is where
she was killed.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.674
Murdoch: Why kill her
at her family's gravesite?

30:44.710 --> 30:48.011
Oh, it was assumed that
the murder was her punishment

30:48.013 --> 30:51.281
For the entire family
for keeping her away from him.

30:51.350 --> 30:55.285
It's a reasonable motive when
jimmy mortimer was the suspect,

30:55.420 --> 30:59.022
But why would whitney want
to punish the entire family?

30:59.157 --> 31:01.557
I have absolutely no idea.

31:01.594 --> 31:03.226
It's a very good question.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.695
Where was
the murder weapon found?

31:05.731 --> 31:07.563
In the bushes over there.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.635
That's an odd place
to hide a murder weapon

31:11.637 --> 31:13.103
With your
fingermarks on it.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.704
Yes, I thought so, too.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.639
That's why I had doubts.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.642
Jimmy mortimer
was no intellectual,

31:18.777 --> 31:21.111
But he certainly had
a street boy's cunning.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.979
[loud bang]

31:28.487 --> 31:31.321
Samuel: Percival giles,
put your hands in the air!

31:31.357 --> 31:33.123
Oh, no.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.792
Do as he says,
mr. Giles.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.661
No.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.995
Giles!

31:42.968 --> 31:45.268
[gunshots]

31:52.811 --> 31:54.210
[gunshots]

32:00.352 --> 32:01.551
Samuel:
Halt!

32:02.621 --> 32:04.421
Giles! Giles!

32:09.828 --> 32:14.364
[gunshots]

32:18.037 --> 32:21.772
[gunshots]

32:21.774 --> 32:23.039
Stop!

32:23.108 --> 32:24.574
Are you mad?

32:24.710 --> 32:27.444
Two inches lower and that
would've gone through my head.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.879
I told you to stay
out of my way!

32:29.949 --> 32:32.248
I'll tell you what,
detective.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.384
I will buy you
a brand new hat

32:34.519 --> 32:36.453
If you could explain to me
how an officer of the law

32:36.588 --> 32:38.388
Was abetting a fugitive
from justice.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.789
Abetting?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.258
You were hot on his trail
at suddon's house.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.461
Ten hours later I find you
chatting like old pals.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.297
I'm intent on bringing
mr. Giles back to prison.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.832
And how were you
proposing to do that?

32:48.901 --> 32:51.200
With just your good looks
and your sweet talk?

32:56.442 --> 32:58.074
Homburg, is it?

32:58.143 --> 33:00.810
Mr. Giles was intent on proving
a condemned man innocent.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.879
That's why he
escaped from prison!

33:02.881 --> 33:04.748
He's trying to
save a man's life

33:04.750 --> 33:07.184
And prevent a tragic
miscarriage of justice.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.353
I don't care.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.524
It's a close call, sir.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.860
A little too close
for my liking.

33:16.929 --> 33:19.029
I'd hazard a guess
and say it nicked a few hairs.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.363
[both laugh]

33:20.366 --> 33:21.698
What's the word on giles?

33:21.767 --> 33:24.701
Well, sir, they're searching
ashbridges bay and the harbour,

33:24.770 --> 33:26.570
But so far,
no body has turned up.

33:26.705 --> 33:27.970
So, what's next then?

33:28.007 --> 33:31.207
I have whitney jacobson
coming in for an interview, sir.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.509
I'll pop to toronto bank,
see if they have a record

33:33.545 --> 33:35.445
Of a cash withdrawal for,
what was it?

33:35.580 --> 33:36.546
Thousand dollars?

33:36.548 --> 33:39.182
On or about July 7th, 1902.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.918
And if it came from jacobson's
account, we've got him.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.757
Mr. Jacobson.
Please, have a seat.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.064
So, I understand
percival giles is on the loose.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.332
Any luck in locating him?

33:55.467 --> 33:57.734
Mr. Giles
is still at large.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.470
So, how can I
help you, detective?

34:00.605 --> 34:03.073
I have some questions
pertaining to the murder

34:03.142 --> 34:04.740
Of your former fiance.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.045
Pearl.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.680
Percival giles escaped prison
because he believes

34:10.749 --> 34:13.349
Jimmy mortimer is
innocent of the crime.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.485
Really?

34:15.487 --> 34:18.221
Well, I'll help
any way I can.

34:20.893 --> 34:24.661
Were you aware that she was
infatuated with jimmy mortimer?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.097
I know that he was
infatuated with her.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.967
We have reason to
believe it was mutual,

34:31.003 --> 34:34.170
Which gives you motive.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.339
To kill pearl?

34:38.643 --> 34:40.643
Where were you
the night of her murder?

34:40.645 --> 34:43.179
[laughs]

34:43.248 --> 34:45.314
Some kind of
wedding business.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.850
I don't remember.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.652
It has been seven years.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.253
You don't remem--

34:53.425 --> 34:54.924
Pardon me a moment,
mr. Jacobson.

34:59.064 --> 35:01.064
This is a record of a
thousand-dollar cash withdrawal

35:01.133 --> 35:02.265
From the bank of toronto

35:02.267 --> 35:04.467
The day before
jimmy mortimer escaped.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.669
The exact amount given
to allen suddon.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.939
Yes, but it wasn't drawn
from jacobson's account.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.474
Where from?

35:11.543 --> 35:13.276
It came from the general
expense account

35:13.312 --> 35:15.211
For the household
of fenton wallace.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.014
That is preposterous!

35:18.016 --> 35:19.682
The bank has made
some sort of mistake.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.619
1902, is it? What day?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.221
July 2nd.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.756
Hmm...
July the second.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.928
I don't understand.

35:32.063 --> 35:35.365
Who, beside you,
had access to this account?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.901
-Well, roddy, of course.
-Father's accountant.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.169
Who else?

35:39.171 --> 35:42.438
My wife, the house manager,
the cook...

35:42.508 --> 35:43.973
Why would someone
from this house

35:44.009 --> 35:46.576
Want to free the man
who murdered my sister?

35:46.712 --> 35:48.445
Perhaps they believed
him to be innocent.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.080
No. Never.

35:50.082 --> 35:51.914
Do you believe him
to be innocent?

35:51.916 --> 35:53.449
I believe it's possible.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.651
Why? What do you
know that we don't?

35:55.653 --> 35:58.321
Pearl was not in love
with whitney jacobson.

35:58.456 --> 36:01.124
She was in love
with jimmy mortimer.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.126
She called him her romeo.

36:03.261 --> 36:05.195
She was infatuated.
That is all.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.630
So you knew.

36:06.632 --> 36:09.732
He was the one
infatuated with her.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.134
She was of the gentry.
He was a common street rat.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.337
It was impossible.
She knew it.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.339
She went to tell him
and that is why he killed her.

36:16.474 --> 36:17.807
Fenton:
They found his bloodied knife

36:17.876 --> 36:19.142
In the shrubbery nearby.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.744
It had his fingermarks.

36:20.879 --> 36:25.081
The knife was planted.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.551
Good god!

36:29.755 --> 36:33.623
One of you went up
to his room,

36:33.692 --> 36:36.226
Found his knife,

36:36.295 --> 36:40.096
Took it away and planted
it at the murder scene.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.397
Someone call the police!

36:41.399 --> 36:43.633
All in due time, fenton.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.369
I've made an arrangement
with detective murdoch

36:46.504 --> 36:48.438
That I will
return to prison

36:48.573 --> 36:51.307
At the conclusion
of this investigation.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.443
The truth is
jimmy killed my sister.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.779
There is no one else
that it could have been.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.115
Unless she was intending
to run away with him,

36:59.117 --> 37:00.716
Which would have
been a disgrace

37:00.752 --> 37:02.318
To your family's
reputation.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.920
-Are you suggesting that?
-No. Enough!

37:04.957 --> 37:06.789
I won't hear of this.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.725
Jimmy mortimer
killed my daughter!

37:09.761 --> 37:12.929
And as for all your
scurrilous fantasies,

37:13.064 --> 37:16.265
You do not have a shred
of proof he did not.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.967
Have you?

37:21.206 --> 37:22.939
This inquiry has
concluded, percy.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.676
Time for you to return
to prison where you belong.

37:26.812 --> 37:29.412
Not quite, mr. Wallace.

37:29.547 --> 37:32.015
We may not have proof
this very moment,

37:32.017 --> 37:34.417
But I believe I know
where we can get it.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.824
I don't understand.
What tip? What knife?

37:40.959 --> 37:43.259
We believe the tip of the knife
that killed your sister

37:43.262 --> 37:45.028
May have broken off
in her body.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.763
If it's in there,
that means that jimmy's knife

37:46.832 --> 37:48.498
Could not have been
the murder weapon.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.309
Giles:
Well, there we have it.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.477
That's proof.

38:01.479 --> 38:04.046
Have you found it then?

38:04.082 --> 38:06.649
I was so sure.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.452
Mr. Wallace, did you
plant jimmy's knife

38:09.488 --> 38:10.519
At the murder scene?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.124
It was him!

38:14.259 --> 38:15.792
I had to do something!

38:15.927 --> 38:17.861
He killed her!

38:17.863 --> 38:20.930
There's something else
here under the body.

38:20.932 --> 38:21.964
Ogden:
What is it?

38:30.976 --> 38:33.008
There's the murder weapon.

38:33.045 --> 38:35.678
My mother, she must
have put it there.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.288
There's something else.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.094
It's the missing page
of her diary.

38:51.096 --> 38:55.065
Murdoch: "oh happy dagger
this is thy sheath."

38:55.200 --> 38:57.633
That's from
juliet's death scene.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.035
That's what she says

38:59.170 --> 39:01.304
Just before she
stabs herself in the heart.

39:01.373 --> 39:03.639
So, pearl killed
herself, then.

39:03.709 --> 39:06.442
She was in love with
a man she couldn't have.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.181
And suddenly it
all makes perfect sense.

39:11.316 --> 39:14.183
It was her mother
who discovered the body.

39:14.219 --> 39:17.019
Better a daughter murdered than
suffer the shame of suicide.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.090
Samuel:
Hey! Come on!

39:23.962 --> 39:25.295
Oh, no.

39:25.297 --> 39:26.729
It's detective samuel
and his men.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.465
They'll be here
any minute.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.199
Well, that's excellent
timing, detective.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.735
I need to surrender
myself to your custody.

39:32.738 --> 39:36.071
They'll add years
to your sentence.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.708
Such is the price I must
pay for the truth.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.043
The truth at
all costs, eh?

39:41.045 --> 39:42.412
Indeed.

39:42.481 --> 39:46.282
Escaping from police
custody is a serious offence

39:46.318 --> 39:48.685
And, as you're no doubt aware,
there may well be...

39:48.687 --> 39:50.153
Consequences.

39:50.288 --> 39:51.821
I had to see ava again.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.958
To make amends somehow.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.228
Bring her in
with dignity.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.797
To get at the truth.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.299
The truth at all costs.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.303
But you and I are not
arbiters of justice.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.505
We are merely
servants of the law.

40:09.541 --> 40:14.243
It is no simple task to
remain incorruptible,

40:14.279 --> 40:18.815
Especially in defiance
of one's own conscience.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.384
Cold comfort,
eh inspector?

40:26.758 --> 40:28.591
You're no longer
a servant to the law.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.660
What are you saying?

40:33.031 --> 40:35.130
Take this knife,
point it at me.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.601
[train whistle]

40:38.637 --> 40:40.803
That's the coal train
leaving the port.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.205
It will be coming up
the valley in three minutes.

40:43.241 --> 40:46.542
Take my weapon,
drop the knife

40:46.611 --> 40:48.544
And you can be free.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.648
The choice is
yours, mr. Giles.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.259
-Bloody hell.
-Everyone stand back!

41:03.328 --> 41:04.527
Samuel:
I see 'em. Let's go.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.295
There they are!

41:08.133 --> 41:09.232
They're over here!

41:20.178 --> 41:22.044
He was spotted in buffalo.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.213
Perhaps he's scuttled
another boat?

41:27.786 --> 41:30.920
Detective samuel,
I see your quarry has escaped.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.357
It's in the americans'
hands now, regrettably.

41:34.426 --> 41:36.725
Although maybe you
have no regrets.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.331
I regret he took
my sidearm.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.866
Well, I can't prove
that you let him go.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.201
Bloody right you can't.

41:46.203 --> 41:48.471
So, I guess a deal
is a deal.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.688
[both chuckle]

42:07.559 --> 42:09.091
Are you sure
it's not broken?

42:09.127 --> 42:11.761
Yes. But it may be bruised
for another few days.

42:11.763 --> 42:14.497
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't be. It's fun.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.365
Besides, miss cherry's right,
it's more fun to win.

42:16.434 --> 42:18.568
Oh, dear.

42:18.637 --> 42:19.835
Just keep your hands up
in front of your face,

42:19.871 --> 42:21.036
Miss newsome.

42:21.072 --> 42:23.239
So, we have a new
member of the team

42:23.241 --> 42:24.373
Joining us
today, ladies.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.976
Oh! Mrs. Hart.
Welcome to the team.

42:27.012 --> 42:28.678
That's a coat
I can't afford.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.246
Have you played before?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.048
I've had the rudiments
explained.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.384
Right then ladies,
here's the plan.

42:34.519 --> 42:36.853
It's not enough to bat
the ball back and forth

42:36.855 --> 42:38.387
Until someone fluffs it.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.523
We need to work the ball
to the front of the net,

42:40.592 --> 42:42.191
Get it up high
and then hammer it.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.060
-Hammer it?
-Yes.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.596
Hammer it down,
like driving a spike in.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.064
They won't know
what's hit them.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.431
-Inspector.
-Oh! Of course.

42:49.467 --> 42:52.201
Right, ladies!
Let's volleyball!

43:06.151 --> 43:08.418
