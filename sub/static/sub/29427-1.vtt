WEBVTT

03:18.966 --> 03:23.402
Come here.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.711
Go! Go!

03:33.681 --> 03:35.314
Go!

04:32.406 --> 04:34.640
There's no trees!

04:36.010 --> 04:38.277
Not one.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.647
That's weird, eh?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.317
You're from here, right?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.988
You lived up here a long time?

04:51.292 --> 04:53.825
6,000 years.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.316
Just the necessities, eh?

05:17.751 --> 05:21.720
Oh, yeah.
Sorry to say it's not mine.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.422
Mike Johnston.
Math Department.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.325
Oh, hi.
Russ Sheppard. History.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.693
Alright.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.096
- Oh, I got it. I got it.
- Oh, thanks.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.731
Welcome
to the edge of the world.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.633
Or the end of the world,

05:34.635 --> 05:36.835
depending on how long
you've been here.

05:37.404 --> 05:40.105
So you got this job
like 20 minutes ago, eh?

05:40.107 --> 05:42.908
Yeah, well, considering I had 48
hours to decide when I graduated,

05:42.910 --> 05:45.711
you're going to have
to give me the lay of the land.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.346
You like it up here?

05:47.348 --> 05:48.680
The money's good

05:48.682 --> 05:51.083
and I put a lot of miles
between me and the ex.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.785
How come you're scraping
the bottom of the barrel?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.053
I owe the government.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.489
I'm in that
Work-For-School program.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.623
I'm stoked for this, though.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.059
I'll spend the year up north

06:01.061 --> 06:03.128
and then I'm short-listed
for a great prep school

06:03.130 --> 06:05.931
so when I'm done here,
I'm golden.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.400
Over here on the left,
that's the community freezer.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.868
That's where everyone
stores their kills.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.803
Seal, caribou, polar bear.

06:11.805 --> 06:15.006
Over here on the right,
that's the Cop Shop.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.375
Both nice guys.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.810
And right over here,
that's the rink.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.812
Oh, cool.
They got hockey and stuff?

06:20.814 --> 06:23.615
No, the refrigerator coil's
fried out,

06:23.617 --> 06:26.418
so now they just use it for
like, community meetings,

06:26.420 --> 06:27.519
dances, stuff like that.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.856
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Look out.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.758
Oh!

06:32.760 --> 06:35.460
Oh, my God.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.435
I have anxiety issues.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.614
And there's
your group of scholars.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.219
You have 21 students
in your class,

07:34.221 --> 07:37.689
but attendance will vary
greatly from day to day,

07:37.691 --> 07:41.059
season by season.
- Is there a truancy policy?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.462
Students often have
other priorities.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.064
We like to accommodate
their circumstances.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.166
Don't worry,
I'll whip 'em into shape.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.470
They all speak English, right?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.238
The government made
sure of that.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.707
This me?
Alrighty. Janace,

07:55.709 --> 07:58.944
thank you so much for
this terrific opportunity, and...

07:58.946 --> 08:02.180
Save it.
You're not a novelty, Russ.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.982
We use teachers
from Work-For-School

08:03.984 --> 08:05.650
because we can't get
anyone else.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.486
You don't need
to suck up to me.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.554
Just do your job.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.498
Hi, everybody.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.767
Uh, my name is Russ Sheppard,
but you can call me Russ.

08:22.769 --> 08:26.171
Uh, please don't call me
Mr. Sheppard, 'cause...

08:26.173 --> 08:28.807
that's my dad's name.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.279
Wouldn't call you Mister
anyway.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.181
Mister is a white man's word.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.952
Alrighty. Attendance.
Let's give this a shot.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.654
Miranda...

08:42.655 --> 08:43.989
Atatahak.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.025
How'd I do?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.029
You can tell me
if I got it wrong.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.568
Was it that bad?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.639
I'm Spring
and you said it right.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.708
In Inuit custom, raising
the eyebrows means yes.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.611
Good to know.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.280
Kyle Aviak.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.251
Kyle. Present?

09:13.253 --> 09:16.821
Uh, Shani Ikniq...
Ikniqpal...

09:16.823 --> 09:18.790
Ikniqpalagaq. Sorry.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.792
No? Uh...

09:20.794 --> 09:23.795
Kathy Itigaiqpaituk.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.664
No?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.032
Uh, Adam Kikpak.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.867
Adam doesn't do school
any more.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.635
Well, he's listed here.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.003
His elders say no.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.805
He gets to be out
on the land now.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.808
That's a new one.
And you are?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.578
Roger. Roger Saata.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.046
Roger. Got it.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.748
Zach Tuluguq.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.851
Zach, okay?

09:46.853 --> 09:48.286
Jason Mitivik.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.822
No Jason Mitivik?

09:50.824 --> 09:53.792
- He's not coming back.
- Drop it.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.799
Everybody knows that this is
the first day of school, right?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.267
Hey, Russ!

10:03.036 --> 10:04.369
How bad did you mess up?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.805
- Beg your pardon?
- Must've lost a bet.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.273
Owed money, skipped town.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.708
They won't find you here, man.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.976
Let's get something straight.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.378
In my class,
respect will be demanded.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.114
Okay? And you'll receive it
when you've earned it.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.354
What did you just say?
Please speak English here.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.389
Are you saying I can't speak
my own tongue?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.091
No, no-no.
I am not, I just...

10:26.093 --> 10:28.059
I have a right to speak
my native language.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.096
Yes, but you don't have
a right to disrupt this class.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.933
I said...

10:38.105 --> 10:41.973
Okay. Here we go.
Day one. Detention.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.341
Not now. After school.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.943
- I'm done now.
- I'm not,

10:44.945 --> 10:47.045
so you can take your seat.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.747
I'll see you later, Russ.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.249
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to go through me

10:51.251 --> 10:52.884
to get out that door.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.789
Oh!

10:57.791 --> 11:00.025
Hey!

11:00.027 --> 11:02.260
Trial by fire, buddy boy.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.063
Janace said she's not going to suspend him.
What the hell's up with that?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.165
Because to him
and the rest of these kids,

11:07.167 --> 11:09.067
being told that they can't go
to school

11:09.069 --> 11:11.202
isn't exactly a punishment.
No one gives a shit.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.337
Sorry.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.706
Look, you don't need algebra

11:14.708 --> 11:17.308
when you hunt and live off the
land, and that's how they roll,

11:17.310 --> 11:18.710
so they figure:
what's the point?

11:18.712 --> 11:19.944
Don't they want
an education,

11:19.946 --> 11:21.880
so they can get the hell
out of here?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.815
Spoken like a true Qabliunaaq.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.316
What's that? Asshole?

11:25.318 --> 11:28.286
White guy.
Same thing.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.722
Yeah.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.692
$327 and 65 cents.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.326
I'm sorry, what?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.031
I got like, twelve things.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.835
Why do you think
they kill their own food?

11:43.837 --> 11:46.071
I owe you 16 bucks.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.208
Oh...

11:50.210 --> 11:53.845
Funeral.
Second kid this month.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.447
Blew his brains out.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.750
They warn you about a lot of
stuff when you take this job,

11:58.752 --> 11:59.884
but never that.
- Jesus.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.486
Is it like, a copycat thing?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.822
No, it's like
an epidemic type thing.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.758
It's a bad scene for a lot
of the kids up here, eh.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.093
Suicide?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.994
What's being done?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.996
Nothing.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.032
Or, nothing that works.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.235
How do you handle it up here?

12:17.904 --> 12:21.439
Man, I do the same thing
everyone else does: I drink.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.011
Did you steal my booze?

12:27.013 --> 12:30.181
Come on!
Answer me.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.451
Come on.
I know you steal from me!

12:36.123 --> 12:38.456
You let him steal from me?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.091
Hey, leave her alone!

12:40.093 --> 12:43.361
Why?
What are you gonna do, huh?

12:43.363 --> 12:45.530
You gonna run away?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.877
You know he's lying.

12:58.879 --> 13:03.181
- Tell me where it is!
- Kyle!

13:04.050 --> 13:07.152
Kyle!
- I don't take shit!

13:07.154 --> 13:09.854
From nobody!

13:11.158 --> 13:14.325
What the hell?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.807
Okay, I know
what you're thinking:

13:28.809 --> 13:30.909
history's a bore, right?

13:30.911 --> 13:34.345
Names and dates but, guys,
history is a story.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.582
A true story.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.584
Yes, Zach?

13:39.586 --> 13:42.153
Or, sorry,
do you prefer Mike Tyson?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.488
Who?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.156
What's your question.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.560
- Can I go to the washroom?
- Knock yourself out.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.862
Okay, listen up...

13:50.864 --> 13:52.897
I want three pages,
double-spaced,

13:52.899 --> 13:55.266
on the history
of anything you want.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.870
Person, place or thing.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.206
I'm gonna write about Spring.
She's my sun,

14:01.208 --> 14:03.274
my moon and my stars.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.910
Very poetic. Maybe save that
for English class.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.880
Okay, guys. Three pages.
One hour. Go.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.917
What's up, man?

14:14.487 --> 14:18.056
You should get a load
of this white guy, man.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.074
That's right, Russ Sheppard.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.076
Yes, I just want to confirm that
I'm still on the short-list?

14:39.479 --> 14:41.079
Uh-huh, great. That's great.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.381
Yeah, just let me know
if there's anything else

14:43.383 --> 14:46.517
that you need from me to
ensure that I'm a front-runner.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.486
Mm-hmm.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.988
No, St. Andrew's Academy,

14:49.990 --> 14:53.091
it would be a perfect fit
for me, sir.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.326
♪ Trusting myself
and this path that I'm on ♪

14:55.328 --> 14:57.495

14:57.497 --> 14:59.998

15:07.040 --> 15:08.506
Hey, guys.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.975
Russ! I love this girl!

15:10.977 --> 15:13.311
She's my sun, my moon,
my stars!

15:13.313 --> 15:15.079
I remember.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.590
You okay, Spring?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.393
You sure?

15:29.195 --> 15:30.561
What's up with this guy?

15:33.533 --> 15:36.167
You guys are all up
pretty late.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.938
What're you gonna do, huh?
Call the RCMP?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.607
Make a citizen's arrest?

15:43.543 --> 15:45.977
Gonna go get some shut-eye,

15:45.979 --> 15:47.578
otherwise you guys won't be

15:47.580 --> 15:50.248
the only ones
sleeping through my class.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.083
'Night.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.596
Open the door!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.300
Open the door!

16:09.302 --> 16:11.569
He's gonna kill me!
- Spring, who...

16:11.571 --> 16:13.972
- He's coming!
- Who did this to you?

16:13.974 --> 16:15.206
- Please!
- Spring!

16:15.208 --> 16:18.242
- Get inside. Get inside.
- Spring! Spring!

16:18.244 --> 16:21.045
Hey, what the hell, Roger?
You hit her?! Hey!

16:21.047 --> 16:24.582
- I wanna see Spring.
- Roger, stop it. Back up, now.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.085
I gotta see her.
I love her.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.519
You're not gonna see
her right now.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.288
You're drunk
and she's bleeding.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.156
Now go home!
- I can't live...

16:32.158 --> 16:35.193
Go home, Roger, you hear me?
Get the hell out of here! Now!

16:46.006 --> 16:48.106
Roger's gone.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.176
Let's get you home.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.798
I hope you feel like shit

17:13.800 --> 17:15.599
and not just because
you're hung-over.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.169
Hey, you cannot hit.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.271
I don't care how mad you get,
you cannot hit.

17:20.272 --> 17:23.741
You understand me?
- She won't talk to me.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.178
I fucked up.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.747
Wish I could take it back.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.559
Look, we all screw up, okay?

17:41.561 --> 17:44.128
She's all I got.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.133
What do I do now?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.606
You'll figure it out.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.714
Hey, buddy.
You got a problem?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.683
I hope not.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.352
You in a hurry,
do you need a ride?

18:08.354 --> 18:11.089
Oh, no thanks,
I'm just running.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.558
From what?

18:13.560 --> 18:15.726
No, I mean I'm jogging.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.428
Just jogging.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.737
Pathetic.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.373
One paper.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.875
One.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.877
Thank you, Miranda.
Excellent work. I'm impressed.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.379
Guys, you need to hand in
the assignments

18:35.381 --> 18:37.482
or you will fail this class.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.751
Do you want to fail?

18:40.753 --> 18:44.722
Look, it's...
It's no skin off my nose, okay.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.326
It's less work for me, but...

19:00.273 --> 19:02.507
You know what it means?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.560
<i>He asked me what to do.</i>

20:00.333 --> 20:02.733
He asked me and I let him down.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.469
Buddy,

20:05.471 --> 20:08.272
there was nothing you could do.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.454
Does anybody want to talk?

20:56.990 --> 21:00.324
About Roger or anything?

21:00.693 --> 21:02.994
What's the point?

21:53.579 --> 21:56.681
Get out!

22:53.106 --> 22:54.572
Oh, geez!

22:55.608 --> 22:58.142
You scared the crap out of me.
What the hell?

22:58.144 --> 23:00.378
Hey, were you sleeping
in there?

23:00.380 --> 23:01.912
Kyle!

23:04.984 --> 23:06.917
Hey, Kyle!

23:36.015 --> 23:37.882
Just knock and enter here,
Russ.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.684
No one actually waits
at the door in Kug,

23:40.686 --> 23:42.920
otherwise you'll be out here
all day.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.489
Right.

23:45.491 --> 23:46.891
Who would they play?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.793
The nearest school is
hundreds of miles away.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.194
It would be a house league.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.196
They'll play each other.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.799
These kids,
they are starving for something.

23:54.801 --> 23:58.569
They need an outlet, to get
involved in something besides

23:58.571 --> 24:01.839
this damn 'Night Culture'
or whatever you call it.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.874
Sports.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.043
There's more important needs
for the kids.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.645
Well, whatever
you're doing now isn't working.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.747
Who the hell are you
to say what we need?

24:09.749 --> 24:11.682
You've been here
all of five minutes.

24:11.684 --> 24:14.051
That's plenty of time to see
that these kids are in trouble.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.152
Jesus, they're...

24:16.923 --> 24:19.890
Let me try this.
It's worth a shot, isn't it?

24:19.892 --> 24:22.693
Janace,
what have you got to lose?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.831
Whatever's left.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.003
There's...

24:34.073 --> 24:38.642
$300 left in the P.E. budget,
but don't expect...

24:38.644 --> 24:40.077
That's great!
That's perfect.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.779
Thank you, Janace.

24:41.781 --> 24:45.049
They're going to love it.
The kids are going to love it.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.584
I promise you. But um...

24:46.586 --> 24:49.854
Outside. Thank you.
Thanks, guys.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.191
Pushy, eh?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.828
Arrogant and pushy.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.731
<i>No, Dave, it's gonna have
to be used.</i>

25:00.733 --> 25:02.733
I've only got 300 bucks.

25:02.735 --> 25:06.136
Helmets, sticks, gloves,
you know, whatever I can get.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.839
Kugluktuk. North as north gets.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.741
Come on, guys.
Just give it a try.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.277
We're going to have our first
practice this Wednesday.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.614
We've got equipment all sorted
out, so you don't have to...

25:16.616 --> 25:19.116
Kyle! You want to play?
- It's not for me.

25:19.118 --> 25:22.887
- Why not?
- It's just not for me.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.657
Hey, bud, you want to check out
lacrosse Wednesday after school?

25:26.659 --> 25:28.225
I'll see you there.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.896
Hey, Miranda!
Wanna try it?

26:00.693 --> 26:02.693
Hey, guys.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.595
You guys like sports, huh?

26:04.597 --> 26:06.830
I don't like to run.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.767
I don't want
to give up my smokes.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.271
I'm kind of busy.

26:51.377 --> 26:55.613
Just, uh,
treat her right, okay?

26:55.615 --> 26:57.781
That's all I ask.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.385
Hold on! Hold on!

27:01.387 --> 27:04.855
Hey! Easy on the throttle!
Gee whiz.

27:04.857 --> 27:08.058
Hey, hey. That's me.
Both of them.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.260
Alright, thanks, man.
- You're welcome.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.996
Alright.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.752
Kug. Kugluktuk.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.987
Kugluktuk.

28:05.685 --> 28:06.917
Hi.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.188
If you want guys
for the league,

28:11.190 --> 28:13.924
you gotta get Zach and Adam.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.959
You get them

28:15.961 --> 28:17.895
and the rest will come.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.368
Wait, wait, wait!

28:24.370 --> 28:25.469
Uh...

28:25.471 --> 28:27.304
Who's Adam?

28:27.306 --> 28:29.707
He's not in school.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.475
He's a crazy good hunter.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.144
Popular. Like Zach.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.146
Flyers won't work.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.482
You gotta show respect, eh?

28:38.484 --> 28:41.085
You gotta go to them.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.458
Hey, Miranda!

28:47.460 --> 28:48.992
Uh...

28:48.994 --> 28:51.095
Thanks!

29:06.912 --> 29:08.445
Hi, Adam?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.453
I'm Russ Sheppard.
You were supposed

29:16.455 --> 29:18.489
to be in my class this year.
- I don't go there anymore.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.325
Actually, I just wanted to talk to
you about joining a sports program.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.761
I never really played
any sports.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.896
Well, this is
a really cool game.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.103
I gotta go.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.371
I hear you're a hunter.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.406
Yeah.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.509
I bet you'd be a natural.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.153
Nothing.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.400
Hi, is this Zach's house?

30:03.402 --> 30:06.069
Yep. Mine too. I'm Johnny.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.872
Hey.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.077
You don't have to knock.
Didn't anyone tell you that?

30:14.079 --> 30:16.413
Right. They did.
Thanks.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.078
What are you doing here?

30:47.079 --> 30:48.312
How do you know I'll like it
if I've never played it before?

30:48.314 --> 30:50.914
Because it's a contact sport.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.418
Time to wash up, little man.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.254
You smell like dead walrus.
- See ya.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.890
Not interested. See ya.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.927
I'll pay you 20 bucks.
To try it.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.264
But you gotta bring Adam,
alright,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.099
and a bunch of other guys.

31:09.101 --> 31:12.236
At least a dozen
or you get nothing.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.539
Just one time.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.949
This was my stick in college.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.217
With it...

32:00.552 --> 32:02.352
I slew giants.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.955
Or at least the pituitary
freaks at McGill.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.558
You, with the cigarette.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.360
Tanner.

32:10.362 --> 32:13.063
Tanner, what's the national
sport of Canada?

32:13.065 --> 32:14.364
- Hockey...
- Wrong!

32:14.366 --> 32:16.199
The national sport
of Canada is not hockey.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.634
What?

32:17.636 --> 32:20.103
The national sport of Canada
is lacrosse.

32:20.105 --> 32:24.074
Can anyone tell me
why it's called lacrosse?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.410
Because the name hockey
was already taken?

32:26.412 --> 32:28.045
Look, guys,

32:28.047 --> 32:29.713
lacrosse is way older
than hockey.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.282
Can anyone tell me
who invented the game?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.550
Adam?

32:33.552 --> 32:35.385
The First Nations.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.455
12th-century tribes played
the game to resolve conflict.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.490
Are we gonna learn
about lacrosse

32:40.492 --> 32:42.426
or are we gonna play lacrosse?

32:43.095 --> 32:45.662
Grab a stick, pair up.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.065
Alright, you want to push
with your top hand,

32:48.067 --> 32:50.701
pull with your bottom hand.
Alright?

32:50.703 --> 32:54.104
Push, pull.
Push, pull. Go.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.206
There you go. Good.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.442
Good, Adam.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.546
No, no raking! Raking bad!
Scooping good!

33:02.548 --> 33:05.115
You wanna scoop through it,
Vinny.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.217
It's alright.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.419
Quick, light, easy.
Good.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.421
You wanna keep your stick
by your ear.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.691
It's alright, Vinny.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.326
Nice try.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.128
Step...

33:20.132 --> 33:21.631
Go ahead, Zach.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.774
Good job, Zach.
Back of the line. Bring it in.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.610
Great practice. You guys are
looking really good out there.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.545
Hey, coach, can we do this
again tomorrow?

33:35.547 --> 33:37.647
Yes.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.282
Yeah, we can.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.084
That was alright.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.224
Can I get my 20 bucks?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.727
Yeah.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.530
Hey!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.632
You coming back tomorrow?

34:07.179 --> 34:10.179
What are you doing awake?

34:10.181 --> 34:12.114
You hungry?

34:16.455 --> 34:17.788
Hide these.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.389
Buy lunch at school.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.092
Now go to sleep.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.726
I'm not sleepy.

34:23.728 --> 34:27.164
I say you are.
Head down. Do it.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.300
- Will you sing me a song?
- No.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.369
Please.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.733
Hey.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.768
Hey, I know you...

35:49.748 --> 35:52.215
Welcome to paradise.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.859
Miranda,
can you stay for a sec?

36:02.861 --> 36:05.328
I need help coordinating
practices.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.297
Like administration.
You interested?

36:07.299 --> 36:08.632
Why ask me?

36:08.634 --> 36:11.018
Are you kidding?

36:11.019 --> 36:13.403
You're the smartest,
most responsible kid in the whole school.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.406
You're the reason we have
a team in the first place.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.808
So?

36:21.613 --> 36:22.812
I know that one!

36:22.814 --> 36:24.481
That's a yes!

36:24.483 --> 36:26.383
If we're gonna form a league,

36:26.385 --> 36:27.617
you guys are gonna have

36:27.619 --> 36:29.419
to get in the best shape
of your lives,

36:29.421 --> 36:33.323
so you're gonna race
the best athlete here.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.426
Maggie.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.261
I'll toss the ball
and one at a time,

36:38.263 --> 36:40.297
we'll see if anyone
can beat her to it. Vinny!

36:40.299 --> 36:42.799
Come hold Maggie until I give
the signal. Adam, you're up.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.935
- Serious?
- Serious.

36:48.340 --> 36:52.475
Hey,
have you been drinking?

36:52.477 --> 36:54.311
Are you gonna throw the ball?

36:56.615 --> 36:57.714
♪ Free ♪

36:57.716 --> 37:00.750
Three, two, one, let her go!

37:04.823 --> 37:06.656
You almost got it!

37:06.658 --> 37:07.924
Good girl.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.895
You feel like shit?
Yeah, big surprise.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.898
Might wanna drink Gatorade
instead. Tanner, you're up.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.868
Three, two, one,
let her go.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.709
Three, two, one, let her go!

37:30.515 --> 37:33.516
Three, two, one, let her go!

37:34.853 --> 37:37.887
Three, two, one, let her go!

37:43.996 --> 37:45.528
Come on!

37:45.530 --> 37:47.530
Can no one beat this dog?

37:47.532 --> 37:51.568
Three, two, one, let her go.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.678
Shake it off.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.581
This is retarded.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.418
Hey, hey.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.689
Maggie! Maggie!

38:12.691 --> 38:15.358
Maggie, no!

38:15.360 --> 38:16.693
Maggie! Maggie! No! Stop!

38:16.695 --> 38:17.927
Maggie, stop!

38:21.900 --> 38:24.401
- Kyle!
- Maggie!

38:24.403 --> 38:26.303
Go, go, go, go!

38:31.543 --> 38:32.809
Yeah!

38:40.519 --> 38:43.453
- That was fucked up.
- Whatever.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.088
Hey, you okay?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.727
Please tell me you'll play.

38:52.597 --> 38:55.398
Good, Kyle.
Take the turn.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.768
Outside hand, Braden.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.037
Let's pick it up.
Come on, Tanner.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.009
Come on, Vinny, run!
- I told you. I don't run.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.711
There's a polar bear
after you!

39:07.713 --> 39:08.945
He can have me.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.414
Out of my way,
fucking fat-ass.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.417
- Don't be a dick.
- Fuck you.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.986
Hey!

39:19.358 --> 39:21.057
Hey! Hey! Knock it off!

39:22.861 --> 39:26.429
Knock it off!
- Hey, come on, get off him.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.465
Couple of dopes!

39:28.467 --> 39:30.633
You're supposed
to be having fun for once!

39:30.635 --> 39:34.137
Hey, lacrosse is not
a free-for-all for punks!

39:34.139 --> 39:36.139
You play by the rules
or not at all!

39:36.141 --> 39:37.907
We don't know the damn rules!

39:40.145 --> 39:43.747
Years ago, games would be
played from sunup to sundown

39:43.749 --> 39:45.048
between hundreds of men.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.150
Everything short of murder
was allowed.

39:47.152 --> 39:51.154
Now, however, we do have rules.
Coach, could you come up?

39:51.156 --> 39:54.157
Like I said before,
lacrosse is a contact sport.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.160
You are allowed to hit
but only like this.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.630
And you have to keep your hands
together on your stick.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.465
If your hands are apart...
- Hey!

40:02.467 --> 40:04.134
You're gonna get called
for cross-checking.

40:04.136 --> 40:07.470
Now, you can also use
your stick to knock the ball

40:07.472 --> 40:08.772
out of your opponent's stick,

40:08.774 --> 40:11.007
but you have
to aim for the stick.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.442
Hitting the gloves is okay.

40:12.444 --> 40:13.910
But if you get the arms...
- Ow.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.945
- Or if you hit in the back...
- Stop it!

40:15.947 --> 40:17.747
You're going to get called
for slashing.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.950
You will definitely get called
if you hit him in the head.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.486
I'm not gonna do it.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.657
Any questions?

40:27.659 --> 40:30.860
Alright. Let's divide into teams
and try a game! Gear up!

40:30.862 --> 40:32.195
Miranda, please keep score.

40:34.533 --> 40:38.668
Hey. What the hell?

40:49.214 --> 40:51.147
All set.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.116
Get after it, guys.

41:00.892 --> 41:02.559
What a chicken, man.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.794
Kyle! It's a contact sport!
Up and at 'em!

41:04.796 --> 41:07.831
Guys, let's reset and go again!

41:10.936 --> 41:14.704
Get after it, guys.
Hustle, Adam, get up.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.807
Ball down, guys.
- What do I do?!

41:17.809 --> 41:20.844
Pass or run! Scoop through it!
Yeah.

41:20.846 --> 41:23.613
You can do it.
Shoot! Shoot!

41:26.618 --> 41:28.151
What was that?

41:28.153 --> 41:29.919
Ignore the peanut gallery.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.856
Look, it doesn't matter
how bad you mess up, alright?

41:32.858 --> 41:35.592
I can teach you how to shoot.
That's easy, alright.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.094
But the way you just ran?
You can't teach that.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.563
Alright? Let's go again.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.834
You run like a caribou.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.294
What are we doing?

42:11.296 --> 42:13.229
♪ Another night
out in the cold ♪

42:20.672 --> 42:22.906
Keep running, guys, let's go.

42:26.778 --> 42:30.246
Come on, guys! Let's turn down
the suck and turn up the good.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.116
Vinny! Vinny!

42:43.995 --> 42:45.995
Pick it up, guys. Pick it up.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.949
Vinny! Vinny!

43:16.227 --> 43:18.294
Don't step in it.
Don't step in it.

43:18.296 --> 43:20.597
Imagine this is a clock face,
right?

43:20.599 --> 43:23.166
So this is 12, 3, 9,

43:23.168 --> 43:25.335
so when you're loading up
for a shot,

43:25.337 --> 43:28.171
you're not holding your stick
down, you're pulling it out.

43:28.173 --> 43:29.372
- Right.
- Alright? You understand?

43:29.374 --> 43:33.042
- This is bullshit!
- Come on!

43:33.044 --> 43:36.045
His little stick
and his little white friend.

43:36.047 --> 43:38.815
You piece of shit!
- Hey, Harry!

43:38.817 --> 43:41.384
Let's go. Come on.
- Just hold on!

43:41.386 --> 43:43.886
He came home.

43:43.888 --> 43:46.222
Move. Watch your head.

43:46.224 --> 43:48.191
You're hurting me,
you motherfuckers.

43:49.227 --> 43:52.328
Get me out of here.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.001
I didn't do anything!

44:03.775 --> 44:05.274
You alright?

44:05.276 --> 44:07.343
My dad...

44:08.246 --> 44:11.648
Listen, I've got some stew
going in my crock pot.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.349
You, uh...

44:14.653 --> 44:16.352
You should come join us.

44:16.354 --> 44:19.055
You mean you
and your inside dog.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.357
Yeah, Maggie's the only girl
who'll put up with me.

44:21.359 --> 44:24.260
Alright?
- She belonged to my cousin.

44:24.262 --> 44:26.729
Oh, why didn't you say
anything?

44:26.731 --> 44:28.831
Shit, I gotta give her back.

44:28.833 --> 44:29.999
No.

44:30.435 --> 44:34.037
Jason,
he killed himself last month.

44:35.940 --> 44:38.374
Oh, God, Kyle...

44:43.415 --> 44:47.083
Your mom has a broken arm
and a concussion.

44:47.085 --> 44:50.420
They said they'd release her
in the morning.

44:53.091 --> 44:55.792
I should've been home.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.395
Listen, it's not your fault.

45:01.966 --> 45:04.233
I know it's not me.

45:08.339 --> 45:09.906
It's my dad.

45:11.810 --> 45:15.044
He's a Residential School
survivor.

45:15.380 --> 45:19.749
He was, like...
abused and stuff.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.921
And I just feel bad for him.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.423
It's like,

45:27.859 --> 45:30.426
I wish I could help him, right,

45:31.863 --> 45:34.931
but I don't know what to do.

45:49.514 --> 45:52.448
I'm sorry. I'm busy at school.

45:56.855 --> 45:59.055
I know, I'm sorry.

46:03.528 --> 46:06.496
You knew I left a casserole
in the fridge. Why didn't you...

46:07.332 --> 46:10.333
You heard him.
You should be home helping out.

46:10.335 --> 46:14.470
Don't think you could leave it
all to me, Fat and Lazy.

46:28.419 --> 46:29.519
Hey, hey.

46:54.212 --> 46:56.245
Bring it in, guys. Gather up!

46:56.247 --> 46:59.582
I have to ask you all
a very important question:

46:59.584 --> 47:02.118
How many of you have
girlfriends?

47:03.421 --> 47:06.589
Come on. Don't be shy.
How many have girlfriends?

47:07.258 --> 47:10.893
Okay, as of right now,
you all do.

47:10.895 --> 47:12.562
Your stick.

47:12.564 --> 47:14.897
This is Suzy.

47:14.899 --> 47:17.934
In college,
this was my girlfriend.

47:17.936 --> 47:19.468
It's the best girlfriend
I ever had.

47:19.470 --> 47:21.270
Every chance you get,

47:21.272 --> 47:23.306
I want you to practice
your stick skills.

47:23.308 --> 47:26.943
<i>So everywhere you go, I want
your stick to go with you.</i>

47:26.945 --> 47:29.378
Eat dinner next to it,
you sleep with it.

47:29.380 --> 47:30.980
You treat her right, Zach.

48:06.484 --> 48:08.484
Listen up: Breaking news.

48:08.486 --> 48:11.287
Lacrosse is not just fun
and games anymore.

48:11.289 --> 48:15.992
I made some calls to ask if
I could bring a late entry team

48:15.994 --> 48:20.263
to the High School Lacrosse
Nationals in Toronto,

48:20.265 --> 48:22.198
and they just said yes.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.967
Now, the Nationals are
at the end of July.

48:24.969 --> 48:26.335
That's only five months away!

48:26.337 --> 48:28.671
So we are starting
the house league now

48:28.673 --> 48:31.908
with three teams
and at the end of the season,

48:31.910 --> 48:33.342
we're going to the Nationals!

48:33.344 --> 48:35.511
You with me?

48:35.513 --> 48:37.280
Anybody? Does this...

48:39.150 --> 48:43.185
- Uh, what's Toronto?
- It's a big city in the south.

48:43.187 --> 48:45.922
Now are you with me?

48:45.924 --> 48:49.225
Yeah!

48:50.695 --> 48:52.428
Party! Party!

48:55.133 --> 48:58.000
No-no-no-no-no-no!

49:00.505 --> 49:01.938
Party! Party!

49:01.940 --> 49:04.373
No! No! No partying!

49:04.375 --> 49:06.542
Yeah, uh...

49:06.544 --> 49:09.512
that's right, people. Okay?
No partying. No way. Don't...

49:09.514 --> 49:11.714
You cannot win with that crap
in your system.

49:11.716 --> 49:14.250
We got to start
making better choices

49:14.252 --> 49:18.020
than booze and drugs, guys.
It's time to get serious.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.690
Let's get to work.

49:23.061 --> 49:26.095
Russ, moving a little fast,
don't you think?

49:26.097 --> 49:28.230
I mean, uh...

49:28.232 --> 49:31.300
the Nationals?
- You've got a plan, eh?

49:31.302 --> 49:33.102
About raising money?

49:33.104 --> 49:36.305
Yeah, my plan is, you know,
to make a plan.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.642
Who's gonna go, guys?

49:39.644 --> 49:43.612
You? You? You? Sticks up, guys,
sticks up, sticks up.

49:43.614 --> 49:46.482
Toronto, on three.
- One, two, three.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.084
<i>Toronto?</i>

49:48.086 --> 49:50.753
I've been dealing
with irate parents all day.

49:50.755 --> 49:52.355
Why didn't you
come to me first?

49:52.357 --> 49:54.690
Sorry, how is this anything
but good news?

49:54.692 --> 49:56.392
Even if the parents agreed,

49:56.394 --> 49:59.395
do you have any idea
how much this would cost?

49:59.397 --> 50:04.233
Airfare alone costs
$2,000 per child.

50:04.235 --> 50:07.636
No one can afford that.
- We're going to fund-raise.

50:07.638 --> 50:09.739
We'll figure it out, I promise.

50:09.741 --> 50:12.675
Broken promises
are dangerous here.

50:12.677 --> 50:15.478
You know what happens
when these kids are hurt

50:15.480 --> 50:18.047
and disappointed?
- I'm not gonna let that happen.

50:18.049 --> 50:21.017
And the worst part is
they're already so excited.

50:21.019 --> 50:23.452
Most of them have
never gone further

50:23.454 --> 50:25.321
than you can go
on a snowmobile.

50:25.323 --> 50:27.390
You should have discussed this
with me

50:27.392 --> 50:29.458
before you went and raised
their hopes...

50:29.460 --> 50:31.360
That's the whole point,
Janace!

50:31.362 --> 50:34.797
It's to raise their damn hopes!
- No! It's unrealistic.

50:34.799 --> 50:37.299
You don't want them
reaching for something

50:37.301 --> 50:40.436
that they care about?
- There's a cost for reaching.

50:40.438 --> 50:43.105
They're alive! They are
working crazy hard...

50:43.107 --> 50:47.243
Not at school, not at home.
They're not even in class!

50:47.645 --> 50:49.578
I'm shutting you down today.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.048
Don't worry,
you can blame it on me.

50:52.050 --> 50:55.284
No-no-no! Just, please,
wait a second. Let me think!

50:55.286 --> 50:59.321
Your sports program is doing
more harm than good.

50:59.323 --> 51:01.524
Please don't shut us down, Janace.
These kids are motivated

51:01.526 --> 51:03.392
for the first time
since I've been here.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.761
They're happy.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.664
Please!

51:08.666 --> 51:12.368
Would you please
give us this chance?

51:13.671 --> 51:15.704
I urge you to not add

51:15.706 --> 51:19.241
to the long list of promises
made to the Inuit

51:19.243 --> 51:21.077
that will never be kept.

51:25.183 --> 51:26.449
What about local businesses?

51:26.451 --> 51:28.484
You think anyone
would sponsor us?

51:28.486 --> 51:30.653
I heard that the airline
sometimes offers sponsorships.

51:30.655 --> 51:33.222
I could call Sam at First Air
and see.

51:33.224 --> 51:34.857
Great! Do it!

51:34.859 --> 51:38.327
I was also thinking that we
could charge for the games?

51:38.329 --> 51:41.397
- I was just gonna suggest that.
- And sell pop and pizza

51:41.399 --> 51:43.632
to raise money?
- There we go, that's... smart.

51:43.634 --> 51:45.334
No, that's good thinking.
I like that.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.836
But if we play
for the community,

51:46.838 --> 51:49.338
aren't we gonna need jerseys
to tell the teams apart?

51:49.340 --> 51:51.640
- Yeah, totally. That's a thing.
- Right. Yes.

51:51.642 --> 51:53.309
How do we pay for those?

51:59.383 --> 52:01.183
Yeah, okay.

52:02.386 --> 52:03.786
Here we go.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.555
Maybe we could ask Spring
to design them?

52:06.557 --> 52:09.191
She's a really good artist.

52:09.193 --> 52:12.194
Well, she hasn't been here
since, uh...

52:12.196 --> 52:13.829
I know.

52:14.398 --> 52:15.898
I'll go see her.

52:31.282 --> 52:33.349
Hey, Spring.

52:35.153 --> 52:37.520
Now, we're not looking
for straight A's.

52:37.522 --> 52:40.422
If teachers tell us
you're here, trying hard,

52:40.424 --> 52:42.258
you get to play.

52:42.260 --> 52:44.260
You'll also have to meet all
your obligations at home.

52:44.262 --> 52:47.296
But so long as you come to
school at least 80% of the time,

52:47.298 --> 52:49.431
just four days a week,
then you'll play.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.800
No, no, no!

52:51.802 --> 52:53.769
This is not a sucker punch.

52:53.771 --> 52:56.805
Lacrosse is a school program.
It's a fair deal.

52:56.807 --> 52:58.874
See you in class.

53:00.711 --> 53:02.811
Adam. Hey-hey-hey-hey.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.180
Uh...

53:04.182 --> 53:05.447
Can you do it?

53:05.449 --> 53:07.449
They don't even know
I'm playing.

53:07.451 --> 53:08.918
Really?

53:08.920 --> 53:11.220
They don't want me going
to a white man's school.

53:11.222 --> 53:13.589
'Cause that's
what fucked up my parents.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.724
Anyways,
I'm a couple of years behind.

53:15.726 --> 53:19.461
I can tutor you.
Yeah, I'll get you caught up.

53:19.463 --> 53:23.399
Look,
ask your grandparents,

53:23.401 --> 53:26.268
maybe tell 'em
how it's important to you.

53:26.470 --> 53:29.438
Adam,
we'd hate to lose you.

53:30.341 --> 53:31.373
Alright.

54:33.871 --> 54:35.271
Johnny, come here.

54:43.381 --> 54:45.914
Spring, these are fantastic.

54:45.916 --> 54:46.882
Thanks.

54:46.884 --> 54:50.753
I love the warrior.

54:50.755 --> 54:53.455
Roger would've been
totally into it, too.

54:54.525 --> 54:57.626
Is there any chance you're
ready to come back to school?

54:58.562 --> 55:00.562
I've been thinking

55:00.564 --> 55:02.431
and...

55:02.433 --> 55:04.700
I wanna ask you something.

55:05.069 --> 55:07.336
Guys, listen up.

55:08.072 --> 55:10.806
Hey, Spring?!
What are you doing here?

55:10.808 --> 55:12.541
Same as you.

55:12.543 --> 55:14.777
A girl? No way.

55:15.579 --> 55:17.479
Way.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.849
Move the ball?

55:22.586 --> 55:24.453
Find each other, guys,
let's go.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.388
Move that ball, Adam, let's go?

55:27.591 --> 55:29.591
Stop! Stop.
Stop right where you are!

55:29.593 --> 55:30.926
Shut your eyes.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.763
Okay, without looking,

55:34.765 --> 55:37.633
who's got the ball?
- Adam.

55:37.635 --> 55:39.368
Point at where he is.

55:40.771 --> 55:42.971
Come on, guys.
You've played with him.

55:42.973 --> 55:45.007
You know
which hand he favors.

55:46.610 --> 55:48.010
Where's Zach?

55:48.779 --> 55:50.946
Guys, does Zach
like to go to the outside

55:50.948 --> 55:53.115
or does he like
to go up the middle,

55:53.117 --> 55:56.051
knock defenders on their asses?

55:57.054 --> 55:59.121
Where's Kyle?

56:03.461 --> 56:05.594
You don't know where he is
because he's always moving,

56:05.596 --> 56:08.063
guys,
he's looking for the clear.

56:08.733 --> 56:11.433
But Adam knows where he is,
don't you, Adam?

56:12.737 --> 56:14.603
Good.

56:14.605 --> 56:17.639
I want you to remember
this moment.

56:17.641 --> 56:20.075
You can't be individuals
on the field.

56:21.145 --> 56:24.580
You need to work together
as one.

56:25.416 --> 56:28.083
'Cause when you guys
work together,

56:28.919 --> 56:30.953
when you connect as a team,

56:31.756 --> 56:34.923
I mean, that is
when you will truly be great.

56:36.694 --> 56:38.761
Let's play on.

57:23.741 --> 57:25.174
Okay.

57:32.983 --> 57:34.683
Whoa!

57:38.589 --> 57:39.955
Whoo!

58:04.982 --> 58:08.083
Alright, everyone have
their assignments for me?

58:17.695 --> 58:20.095
Quarterfinals next week!

58:20.097 --> 58:22.097
Quarterfinals
next week!

58:22.099 --> 58:25.968
Yeah!
Quarterfinals next week!

58:46.123 --> 58:48.524
- Miranda?
- Here.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.659
Kyle?

58:50.661 --> 58:52.227
Where is Kyle?

58:52.796 --> 58:54.229
Adam?

58:59.937 --> 59:02.738
Hustle back, guys, hustle back.

59:04.041 --> 59:05.307
Good.
Who's got Thomas?

59:05.309 --> 59:08.143
Good, Brady, good grab.
Let's go.

59:08.145 --> 59:11.246
Let's go, Zach.
Let's go!

59:15.152 --> 59:17.319
Bring it in, guys.

59:17.321 --> 59:20.222
Zach, move your ass!

59:20.224 --> 59:22.791
What the hell was that
all about?

59:22.793 --> 59:24.760
It's the last game
before the quarterfinals,

59:24.762 --> 59:26.929
and you look like
my grandmother out there.

59:26.931 --> 59:28.063
- Whatever.
- No, incorrect response.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.164
- Whatever.
- Really?

59:29.166 --> 59:30.766
That's how we're
gonna play this?

59:30.768 --> 59:32.200
Okay, everybody listen up.

59:32.202 --> 59:34.636
Since Zach here
needs to light a fire

59:34.638 --> 59:36.838
and learn
how to be a team player,

59:36.840 --> 59:40.208
we are going to practice every day.
- You trying to kill us?

59:40.210 --> 59:43.712
A team is only as strong
as its weakest player.

59:43.714 --> 59:46.815
There's no room in lacrosse
for little whiney babies.

59:58.362 --> 01:00:01.129
Turn off the fucking light.

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:32.794
Let's go!

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.997
Let's go, guys.

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.332
Damn it...

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.769
- Zach's team is falling apart.
- Pass it!

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.738
He made his choice.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:49.077
We Inuit love this land
because we can see for miles.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:52.114
We notice every little thing.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:54.249
But you?

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.918
You only see right here.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.988
Right in front of your face.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.192
All of us have made sacrifices
to be here.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:07.262
All of us.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:10.799
You really don't think Zach
doesn't want to play?

01:01:10.801 --> 01:01:13.101
You've been to his house.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:18.306
Did you not see?
His family is starving.

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.676
He has to hunt.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.811
Get a clue.

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:33.021
Quit playing with that.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.981
Hey. Hi.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.317
I owe you an apology.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:05.353
I'm sorry.
I'm dense sometimes.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.989
We're just eating.
Do you want to join us?

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:10.258
No. I'm good, thanks.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.127
Gonna get going.

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.465
No room in lacrosse
for whiney babies, eh?

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:19.935
See you tomorrow.
- You know it.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:59.274
I was, uh, I was hoping
we could talk.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.209
You're not very popular.

01:03:01.211 --> 01:03:03.445
You just scared away
all the seal.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:07.382
- Oh, sorry, I thought...
- If you even move your toe,

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:10.252
the seal can hear it
and they leave.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.420
We've been waiting here
for hours.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:13.922
Shit.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:17.225
Sorry!
My bad! I'm sorry!

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.997
You never told them
you were playing?

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.835
Did they know that
you were coming to school?

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.339
Okay.

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:35.177
I'm not asking him
to forget the old ways.

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:39.080
He loves the sport
and he excels at it.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:41.550
He's an asset to the team.

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:44.586
I understand hunting
and culture is important,

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:49.157
but if he attends school,
he can play lacrosse.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.918
Lacrosse helped me find my way

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.487
when I thought nothing
would ever go right.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.327
I want you to have her.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:37.005
Sam, Lena,
thank you for your time.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.492
Long ago,

01:04:57.494 --> 01:05:01.496
Sedna was dissatisfied

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:05.166
with the man found for her
by her father,

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:07.068
so she marries a dog.

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:14.910
Her father is so angry

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:17.913
he throws her into the sea
and chops off her fingers.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:31.259
Her fingers become
the first seals.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.496
When a Shaman is sent out
to dry her tears,

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:37.399
she releases the seals
to the hunters.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.536
That's the end.

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:43.538
There's a few versions,

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.142
but she gets her fingers
chopped off in all of them.

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:58.386
Elders often answer a question
with a story.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.056
It's kind of a pain in the ass
sometimes.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:04.392
Any idea
what the take-away is?

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:07.262
You're supposed
to figure it out.

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:13.501
Russ...

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:16.137
Thank you.

01:06:17.407 --> 01:06:19.975
I hope you can come back.

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.236
Anybody seen Adam?

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.239
I made it.
I made the finals.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.575
I don't want
to hear that shit.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:31.546
You'd rather be
with that Qablunaaq, Russ,

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.615
than with your own family?
Is that it?

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.656
How could you?
You burned my books?

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.625
I can't believe you did that.

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:47.829
I told you over and over.
Family comes first.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:50.698
Not school, not some fucking
white man's game.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:21.162
If you ever touch me like
that again, I'll call the cops.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.098
Just try it!

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.567
You don't know the first thing
about being a family.

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:06.640
Tonight...

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.511
you're going to war.

01:09:09.513 --> 01:09:11.813
Now those guys
in the other room, by day,

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.549
they may be your friends
and your classmates,

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:15.649
but tonight...

01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.486
tonight,
they're your enemy.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.488
Will you fight?

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:23.625
Will you win?
- Yeah!

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:24.926
- Who are you?
- Wolfpack!

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:26.594
- Who are you?
- Warriors!

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.863
Let's go get 'em!

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:09.938
<i>Kyle, you alright?</i>

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:13.641
Answer me!

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.945
<i>I'm not gonna fight you,
Dad.</i>

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.815
<i>And I'm not gonna run away
either.</i>

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:23.218
<i>I want us to be a family.</i>

01:10:37.601 --> 01:10:40.602
Yeah! Whoo!

01:10:51.815 --> 01:10:53.982
One, two, three, Wolfpack!

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.018
Guys, what are you doing?
Get yourselves in here.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.658
We wanted to get you
jerseys...

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.861
But we needed a new team name
so we all came up with one

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.663
and Spring did the painting.

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:15.870
Oh, wow.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.639
You painted these?

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:19.607
What do you think?

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:29.284
- Who are we?
- Grizzlies!

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:37.525
I'll be sending lots of luck.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:39.360
What, from the sidelines?

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:41.929
Mir, we're not going without
you. You're part of the team.

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:44.599
Oh!

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:47.402
You did good this season,
alright?

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:49.370
Thank you.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:54.909
We got a bit of a problem.

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:58.746
Um, one of our big sponsors
bailed and we're a little short.

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:00.048
By how much?

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.417
Twenty grand.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.421
When do you want to tell
the kids they can't go?

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:14.429
Do you not get it?
I can't disappoint them.

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.931
- What's going on?
- He's just... he's a little upset.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.033
I told him about the money

01:12:21.471 --> 01:12:23.037
Mail came today.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.841
I wrote a letter
a few months ago.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:30.778
We've been allowed to present
our case to the Town Council

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.480
at the Heritage Fund meeting.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:34.982
I'm sorry, the who and the
what now? What are we...?

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.618
Every year the diamond mine
gives the town some money

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.987
to keep the peace.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:44.659
The Town Council decides
where to allocate the funds.

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:46.761
They're meeting next week.

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:49.864
- So they can help us?
- We'll have to petition,

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.966
and everyone will have
to agree.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.736
Yeah, we're boned.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:56.371
Well, do you think
we have a chance?

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:59.407
I think it's our only chance.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:04.078
Class attendance
has never been higher...

01:13:06.516 --> 01:13:08.816
And so are our grades.

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:10.952
This grant would reward
the kids

01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:14.155
for all of their efforts and,
even more importantly,

01:13:14.157 --> 01:13:18.493
to inspire them to continue
striving and working hard

01:13:18.495 --> 01:13:21.562
at their goals and dreams
for the future.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.399
Thank you.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:26.134
Mir-an-da!

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:29.837
Mir-an-da!
Mir-an-da! Mir-an-da!

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:35.510
Thank you, Miranda Atatahak.
Comments?

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:38.679
The community needs
long-term help,

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:40.848
not some fancy vacation.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:43.518
- Not all of us love sports.
- Fixing the roads

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.654
is more important
than a quick trip to the South.

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:48.689
- Yeah!
- If I may...

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:52.727
I have a problem
with this request.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:54.929
Of course,

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:59.000
I believe the money should go
to children of Kugluktuk,

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:03.638
but we have many children
who do not attend school

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.574
or play on your small team.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.509
Why should they be excluded?

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:11.879
I'm sorry, shouldn't we reward
the kids who do go to school

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:13.681
instead of the kids who don't?

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:17.852
We don't need to defend
our way of life to a Southerner!

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:19.821
All I'm saying is that
these kids are excelling!

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:21.622
Isn't that a good thing?

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.892
We nourish everyone in the
community. We're inclusive.

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.928
These kids are playing
as a community!

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.130
And traveling to Toronto,
it'll give them a chance

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.232
to see something more
than just a few square miles

01:14:31.234 --> 01:14:34.035
out in the middle of nowhere!

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.704
No, no, no, please, everyone,
I didn't phrase that well.

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:39.574
These children don't need to go
south to get an education...

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:42.677
Okay, ask the kids. Ask them what they want!
They've earned this!

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.013
Thank you, Russ Sheppard.

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.850
We will take this to a vote.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:11.606
The request for funds for
the lacrosse team to travel...

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:14.909
has been denied.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.948
It doesn't seem to be
in the greater interest

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:24.185
of the whole community.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:42.737
What did she say?

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:44.972
She doesn't like
the white man's world.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:47.842
It has brought nothing
but sorrow to her people.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.982
She didn't like it when she
found her grandson playing

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:56.250
a strange white man's game.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.787
Then again,

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:03.658
she wasn't keen on snowmobiles
the first time she seen one.

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:09.664
Yes, tradition is important

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.667
and one of our most valuable
lessons Inuit have learned

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:15.770
is that we must adapt
or we will die.

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.339
We must learn how to live

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:20.942
with the world beyond
our borders.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:34.188
The lacrosse kids at the school
carry their heads held high

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:36.791
and with smiles on their faces.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.594
We are proud,
strong,

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.329
full of hope.

01:16:41.331 --> 01:16:43.598
Instead of drinking

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.732
or fighting

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:48.102
or killing ourselves,

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.837
we play.

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:52.340
What is a child
who has forgotten to play?

01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:53.975
How to laugh?

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:56.110
How to have hope
for better things.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:01.749
If the town council cannot
support their young people

01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:04.752
in this, then they have
truly lost their way.

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:23.304
- We're going to Toronto!
- Lena!

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:31.912
Did she get it?

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:34.348
You said your bathtub
is full of seals.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:35.650
Oh, crap. Just...

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:37.785
tell her thank you.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.754
She knows.

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:43.257
And tell her that I understand
Sam's story now.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:46.260
When you affect a change,
there are consequences.

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:47.995
I'll respect that.

01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:54.135
You're a slow learner.

01:18:08.117 --> 01:18:12.386
Toronto! Toronto! Toronto!

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:17.291
Johnny's going crazy, eh?
He's so excited about Toronto.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:19.160
He's proud of his big brother,
huh?

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:20.861
Yeah.
He's gonna love it there.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.129
What?

01:18:22.131 --> 01:18:23.931
Yeah, he can be like,
our mascot.

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:27.301
Oh, Zach, I'm sorry,
we can't bring Johnny with us.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:30.404
But I gotta bring him.
You saw.

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.873
It's team only. I'm sorry.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.776
What if I can get the money?
I could buy the ticket myself.

01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:37.812
He could come then, right?
I can get it.

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.014
We can only take the players
and the coaches.

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:42.316
We can't make any exceptions,
it wouldn't be fair.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:45.453
- He won't be any trouble.
- I'm sorry, I really am,

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:47.121
but you have to understand

01:18:47.123 --> 01:18:49.790
there's just no way
we can take him.

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:51.926
How about I ask Vinny's folks
to look after him?

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:55.029
I bet they'd be happy to.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.865
That's alright.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.366
I'll figure it out.

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:01.235
You sure?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:04.105
Yeah, I'm sure.
Catch you later.

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:05.906
Okay.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:13.814
Remember how I told you
they got buildings there

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:16.317
that touch the sky?
- And lots of people.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:18.753
Tons of people.
Plenty of jobs, too.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.821
I'm gonna get me
on a lacrosse team,

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:22.790
be a professional.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:24.992
We're going to get our own
place, just you and me.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:28.763
- You and me.
- But it's our secret, okay?

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:30.464
You can't tell anybody.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.933
Shh. Zip.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.835
Shh.
Zip.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.873
We're just gonna get on a plane
and fly away.

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:42.042
Alright, little man. Done.

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.849
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:54.255
Yeah, just like that.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:56.791
Just go down with it
a little bit.

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:00.161
Whoo!

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:32.526
Tell me what I can do.

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:34.528
Got two priors.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.431
It's over.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:41.368
Gonna get sent down to Juvie
this time.

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:47.908
I told him
I could take him with me.

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:53.914
I thought we could get out.

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:59.920
Now I can't even
take care of him.

01:21:01.991 --> 01:21:04.558
I screwed everything up.

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.461
Listen to me, Zach.
We are going to find

01:21:07.463 --> 01:21:09.630
a way through this.
Okay? I am right here.

01:21:09.632 --> 01:21:13.133
You are not in this alone.

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:18.105
I will do whatever it takes.

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:20.407
Okay?

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:24.311
Time's up.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:16.357
♪ Lo, how the dream tree is
sighing and shaking ♪

01:23:17.259 --> 01:23:22.229
♪ Pretty dreams fall down

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:29.336

01:24:49.351 --> 01:24:51.685
- You're going?
- Yeah.

01:24:51.687 --> 01:24:53.554
And why is that?

01:24:53.556 --> 01:24:54.521
Why?

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:55.823
Really?

01:24:55.825 --> 01:24:57.624
You're really asking me that?

01:24:57.626 --> 01:25:00.594
What you should be asking is
why the hell would I stay?

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:03.464
So I can screw things up
more than I already have?

01:25:04.867 --> 01:25:06.300
Haven't you figured out yet

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.569
that I don't know
what the hell I'm doing?

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:10.737
So you get our hopes up,

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:12.706
change things,

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.408
and then you walk away?

01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:16.643
- It's not that simple.
- Looks pretty simple to me!

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:21.381
We've been dealing
with this stuff for years

01:25:21.383 --> 01:25:23.217
and we're still here.

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:27.488
You get knocked down one time
and you're gonna run away?

01:25:28.891 --> 01:25:33.193
You came here,
told us how we should be.

01:25:33.896 --> 01:25:36.363
No matter what,
keep on trying,

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:38.365
keep hoping for better things!

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:40.834
This is not about you.

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:45.772
You might not believe
what you said,

01:25:45.774 --> 01:25:47.508
but we do.

01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:51.845
Come with me.

01:26:08.597 --> 01:26:11.365
Sometimes I think
those thoughts.

01:26:12.902 --> 01:26:15.269
That maybe...

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:18.172
I don't want to stick around.

01:26:18.174 --> 01:26:20.474
Sometimes...

01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:22.576
that bad feeling inside,

01:26:24.947 --> 01:26:27.548
it just gets too big...

01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:41.728
Who here has lost someone
in their family?

01:26:47.336 --> 01:26:48.902
More than one?

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:54.908
Yeah, me too.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.782
Each of us has had it tough.

01:27:01.784 --> 01:27:04.851
Real tough.

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:13.293
But we're a family now.

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:16.797
Us.

01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:19.433
Our team.

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.770
We made our own family.

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:27.941
How we got each other
no matter what.

01:27:30.846 --> 01:27:33.747
I say we stay strong.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:36.650
We do
what we came together to do.

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:39.786
What we trained for.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.563
We play.

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:49.089
We'll be looking after Johnny,
okay? Thanks.

01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:52.526
Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

01:28:57.466 --> 01:28:59.566
Thank you.

01:28:59.568 --> 01:29:01.768
Alright, guys, let's load up.
It's time.

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:03.770
- Bye!
- Let's go.

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:05.672
There's no assigned seats,
guys.

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.607
Just sit down somewhere.

01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:10.377
Is that everyone?
Adam, hurry up.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:26.126
Look at how high
those buildings are!

01:31:25.247 --> 01:31:27.881
I didn't want to freak you out
before your first game,

01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:29.616
but that team you just played,
guys,

01:31:29.618 --> 01:31:33.587
yeah, they're ranked number one
in the nation.

01:31:33.589 --> 01:31:35.989
That's the toughest competition
you're going to face here.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:40.227
Okay, the rest of these teams?
Beatable.

01:31:44.967 --> 01:31:46.166
Set it up, Spring!

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:52.639
Oh, geez.

01:32:02.251 --> 01:32:05.919
Spring, you alright?
Come on.

01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:07.787
It's alright,
we'll get it back.

01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:10.190
Let's reset.

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.882
This is the last thing
they need.

01:33:13.622 --> 01:33:16.189
Guys, bring it in.

01:33:20.729 --> 01:33:22.662
Let's take a knee, guys.

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:27.801
Listen, guys,

01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:29.603
I try to come off
like I know everything.

01:33:30.606 --> 01:33:31.838
I don't know jack.

01:33:32.741 --> 01:33:36.676
There is one thing I do know
for sure, though.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.881
You're my family, alright?

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:45.385
My sweaty, punk-ass,

01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:48.855
dysfunctional family
and I love you guys.

01:33:48.857 --> 01:33:52.726
To have come this far, to have
even gotten on that plane

01:33:52.728 --> 01:33:55.762
and tried so hard
in spite of how you feel,

01:33:55.764 --> 01:33:57.030
that is your victory.

01:33:57.032 --> 01:33:59.733
You may not have won
in terms of goals,

01:33:59.735 --> 01:34:02.736
but you played your hearts out
and you stood together,

01:34:02.738 --> 01:34:04.904
and that's what counts.
I couldn't be more proud

01:34:04.906 --> 01:34:06.973
of who you are.

01:34:08.944 --> 01:34:11.344
This is our last game.

01:34:14.783 --> 01:34:16.416
It's not about goals.

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:18.652
Go out there,

01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:20.353
try your best,

01:34:20.355 --> 01:34:23.323
and have fun, guys,
have fun as a team.

01:34:23.892 --> 01:34:26.893
That is truly all that matters.
- Screw that.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.035
Let's get one goal
for our brother, Zach!

01:34:36.805 --> 01:34:38.772
Who's with me?

01:34:38.774 --> 01:34:40.206
Yeah!

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:43.176
One, two, three, Grizzlies!

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:45.812
Whoo! Come on, guys.
We can do this.

01:34:47.749 --> 01:34:50.283
These kids, uh...

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.220
They're, uh, so great...

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:35.428
- Come on, guys. We got this.
- Set.

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.810
Good eat, Vinny.

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:02.021
What is he doing?
- I don't know.

01:36:02.023 --> 01:36:04.924
Vinny, where are you going?

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:10.063
Guys, give him space!

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:12.465
That's it, Vinny, that's it!
Let's go!

01:36:14.035 --> 01:36:15.301
Go! Go! Go!

01:36:16.772 --> 01:36:19.773
Oh, my God!
Shoot, Vinny! Vinny, shoot!

01:36:24.212 --> 01:36:26.112
Oh!

01:36:29.351 --> 01:36:32.452
That was really weird, Vinny!
Good job.

01:36:32.454 --> 01:36:34.320
That's the half.

01:36:34.322 --> 01:36:36.256
Grab a drink, guys.

01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:40.860
One goal,
we can do this.

01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:44.297
We can totally do this, guys.

01:36:57.212 --> 01:37:00.113
Time out. Time out.

01:37:00.115 --> 01:37:01.948
Time out, Grizzlies.

01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:03.817
Did you tell Kyle
to call that?

01:37:03.819 --> 01:37:05.218
No.

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.488
- Bring it in, bring it in!
- What's he doing?

01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:10.590
I don't know.
Guys, what's...

01:37:10.592 --> 01:37:12.358
Okay, when the ref blows
the whistle,

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.527
we're going to huddle back
when I yell caribou

01:37:14.529 --> 01:37:16.963
then we'll break and pretend
Adam has the ball.

01:37:19.267 --> 01:37:20.533
Let's go, Grizzlies!

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:31.077
Caribou!

01:37:31.079 --> 01:37:33.079
Bring it in, bring it in...

01:37:35.050 --> 01:37:37.016
What the hell's a caribou?

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:46.860
Get on nine!
Nine! Nine!

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:55.201
19! 19!

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:58.037
- Oh, my God.
- Trap! Trap!

01:37:58.039 --> 01:38:01.241
19, 19, 19, 19!

01:38:01.243 --> 01:38:03.543
Spring! Spring!

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:38.177
Shoot! Shoot! Come on!

01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:40.647
- Shoot! Shoot, Adam!
- Shoot!

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:48.388
Yeah!

01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:53.192
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:38:53.194 --> 01:38:55.295
My God!
You guys! You guys!

01:40:01.763 --> 01:40:03.997

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:06.232
<i>and what lies before us</i>

01:40:06.234 --> 01:40:10.069

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:12.271

they were the real teachers.</i>
