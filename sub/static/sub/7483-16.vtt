WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:05.704
Who are you?
Jemadar Thapa.

00:05.706 --> 00:08.140
5th Gurkha Rifle Regimen.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.458
Gurkha what? Who?

00:09.459 --> 00:10.775
Commandos recruited from
the mountains of Nepal

00:10.778 --> 00:12.111
at age 14.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.312
They're good
with any blade,

00:13.313 --> 00:14.512
but they made
the kukri famous.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.248
DEEKS:
<i> Pentagon says</i>
<i> that Thapa checks out,</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.117
<i> which means</i>
<i> he's officially on our side.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:19.618
The heart needs
discipline.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.620
Without discipline,
there is no honor.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.489
Without honor, we are nothing.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.024
You know what,
you're pretty cool, Thapa.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.558
For a second there,
I forgot that

00:26.560 --> 00:28.327
you chopped off some guy's head
this morning.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.429
There is only one way
to cross a frozen lake.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.332
Take your time.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.701
She will wait for you.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.771
(camera shutter clicking)

00:40.374 --> 00:42.341
¶ ¶

00:42.343 --> 00:45.811
SAM:
<i> Headed for a dead end.</i>

00:45.813 --> 00:48.280
Or an ambush.
He works alone.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.548
That's his rep.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.053
And it's a lethal one.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.844
¶ ¶

01:36.363 --> 01:38.831
It's okay, Ella.
You have no idea

01:38.833 --> 01:41.733
how far from okay
we really are right now.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.336
Where is he?

01:50.845 --> 01:53.812
I always hoped we'd meet again.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.581
Ella's coming
with us.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.782
Everyone
has a mission.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.484
Your mission's over, Thapa.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.854
Never tell a Gurkha
his mission is over.

02:01.856 --> 02:04.423
You won't like the response.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.394
ELLA:
You don't know what

02:09.396 --> 02:11.296
he can do with that blade.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.198
Been there, done that.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.400
SAM:
Ella...

02:15.402 --> 02:17.736
go to the car.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.304
Go wherever
you please, Ella.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.307
I will find you
once I am finished here.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.310
(pants softly)

02:26.680 --> 02:27.746
Sniper!

02:27.748 --> 02:28.881
(grunts)

02:28.883 --> 02:30.883
Sam!

02:30.885 --> 02:33.152
THAPA:
Callen, the shooter's not mine.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.486
Go.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.829
Thapa, call an ambulance.
On it!

02:48.235 --> 02:50.602
(coughing weakly)

03:12.226 --> 03:15.727
(TV playing indistinctly)
(soft snoring)

03:18.832 --> 03:20.532
Good morning.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.307
That tickles.
(giggles)

03:30.578 --> 03:32.244
Morning,

03:32.246 --> 03:33.545
Detective Deeks.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.914
Good morning, Special
Agent Kensi Blye.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.955
Or should I say...

03:42.957 --> 03:45.824
(high-pitched):
Kay-Kay...

03:45.826 --> 03:47.726
(laughs)
You got to do

03:47.728 --> 03:49.895
this lemon drop shot
with me, Kay.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.630
(high-pitched giggle)

03:51.632 --> 03:52.831
That's not funny.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.633
It was pretty funny.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.502
(sighs)

03:56.503 --> 03:58.370
I knew that introducing you
to my friends was a mistake.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.305
What are you talking about?
Your friends are great.

04:00.307 --> 04:03.442
No, don't-don't do that.
Don't humor me.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.345
All right, well,
in all fairness, they
probably hit their...

04:06.347 --> 04:08.814
great peakness at the age of 15,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.616
but they're
still great.
Yep.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.985
Definitely should've waited.
What are you talking
about, waited?

04:12.987 --> 04:15.454
The time is now.
Besides, if you like them,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.888
I like them.
You don't even

04:16.890 --> 04:18.290
remember their names.

04:18.292 --> 04:21.360
Kat, Mindy, Mandy,
Tiffany and Tiffany.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.463
How can you forget such
a pantheon of crazy girl names?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.565
I think we're moving
too fast.
(chuckles)

04:26.567 --> 04:28.000
And it's awesome.

04:28.002 --> 04:31.270
We are around each other
every day.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.005
Mm-hmm.
Totally awesome.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.539
We see each other
every night.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.908
Totally and completely awesome.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.977
Deeks...

04:38.979 --> 04:41.313
this isn't normal.
We're not normal.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.749
Our fondest memories include
Taliban bullet holes

04:43.751 --> 04:46.051
and Hetty Lange, all right?
You're no Bridget Jones,

04:46.053 --> 04:47.853
and I am no...

04:47.855 --> 04:50.055
whatever the male equivalent
to Bridget Jones is.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.325
You hated my best friends.
I didn't hate
your best friends.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.027
I just spent four hours
talking about brunch spots,

04:55.029 --> 04:58.630
<i> Love Actually,</i> and-and...
and fantasy engagements

04:58.632 --> 05:01.333
while they wore these
matching T-shirts that said:

05:01.335 --> 05:04.036
"Keep calm and eat cupcakes."
Well, for your
information,

05:04.038 --> 05:05.704
I'm also obsessed with
<i> Love Actually,</i> brunch,

05:05.706 --> 05:07.873
and fantasy engagements.
Okay, can we
not do this?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.442
Can we not turn this
into Deeks versus Kensi,

05:10.444 --> 05:12.577
Kat, Mindy, Mandy,
Tiffany and Tiffany?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.946
They make me happy.
Wait, do I not

05:14.948 --> 05:17.049
make you happy?
Yes, you make me
happy, but it's

05:17.051 --> 05:18.917
a different kind of happy.

05:20.954 --> 05:21.987
Wow.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.455
Ouch.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.525
That came out wrong.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.028
Is this really happening?
Are we just having

05:30.030 --> 05:32.097
our first fight here?

05:34.968 --> 05:37.002
Well, uh... (sighs)

05:37.004 --> 05:38.570
Kens.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.972
I just need...
(phone rings)

05:42.076 --> 05:44.843
(two phones ringing)

05:48.849 --> 05:50.949
Deeks.
Kensi.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.720
How bad is it?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.788
He's in surgery.
Hetty's at the hospital.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.457
That's all I know.
The sniper?

05:58.459 --> 06:01.059
In the wind. This op
was supposed to be routine.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.696
CIA did not want Ella flying
into Dulles-- it's too risky.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.965
They brought her from New Delhi
to Amsterdam to L.A.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.634
She was supposed to stay here
for 24 hours while Sam and I

06:09.636 --> 06:11.737
handled any tails that she may
have picked up along the way.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.739
Okay, so what happened?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.774
He happened.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.943
KENSI:
Who gave<i> him</i> clearance?

06:17.945 --> 06:19.010
CALLEN:
Hetty.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.814
India wasn't
about to let her go.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.816
So they sent their best Gurkha.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.018
Thapa's mission was
to bring Ella back home.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.388
No cover, no support.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.823
Totally deniable black op
until Sam stepped

06:31.825 --> 06:33.058
in front of a bullet.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.560
Suddenly India had
to play ball, and fast.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.763
This is a joint task force now.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.731
KENSI:
Are we sure he's on our side?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.666
I trust him.
Yeah, well,
his mission

06:41.668 --> 06:44.035
conflicts with ours.
I trust him.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.838
He was as shocked as I was
when Sam went down.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.673
Without Thapa's help,

06:48.675 --> 06:51.476
we may not have made it to
the hospital in the first place.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.711
(loud whistle)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.647
Are you okay?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.952
Callen?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.695
KENSI:
Thapa.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.280
DEEKS:
Good to see you.

07:12.281 --> 07:13.864
Wish it was
under better circumstances.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.667
I feel the same
way, sahib.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.935
How's that blade of yours?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.837
Sharp. How's your partner?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.705
(scoffs)
Sharper.

07:20.707 --> 07:24.876
ERIC: Well, officially,
India is an ally. Unofficially,

07:24.878 --> 07:27.779
we keep eyes on them like
any other country with nukes.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.681
Ella Desai
is an insider,

07:29.683 --> 07:31.716
a scientist who
has more details

07:31.718 --> 07:33.685
about that region's
nuclear program

07:33.687 --> 07:35.554
than spying
could ever tell us.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.822
Six months ago,

07:36.824 --> 07:38.890
she approached the CIA's
office in New Delhi.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.859
She claims that
her boss was

07:40.861 --> 07:44.129
accepting bribes
from lobbyists.
Why'd she come to us?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.898
Ella says the guilty
parties are too powerful
to prosecute locally.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.800
She's right.
CALLEN:
She also believes

07:48.802 --> 07:50.068
the men running
India's nuclear arsenal

07:50.070 --> 07:52.070
don't take too kindly
to whistleblowers.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.706
She's right about that, too.
KENSI:
Then why are you

07:54.708 --> 07:56.608
dragging her back to India
against her will?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.910
Orders are orders.
ERIC: The Agency
offered her

07:58.912 --> 08:00.946
citizenship
and a cushy analyst job

08:00.948 --> 08:03.949
in exchange
for everything she knows.
CALLEN: Sam and I were

08:03.951 --> 08:05.851
supposed to meet her--
Thapa got there before us.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.219
We chased them
into a warehouse.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.687
THAPA:
Moments later,
Agent Hanna

08:08.689 --> 08:10.889
was bleeding out
on the floor.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.092
CALLEN:
Sam spotted the sniper--
he took the bullet, but he

08:14.094 --> 08:15.060
was not the target.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.162
It was either
me or Ella.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.798
Well, every terrorist
group wants what's
inside of Ella's head.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.833
Killing Thapa puts them
one step closer.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.418
KENSI:
Whereas killing her

08:23.419 --> 08:25.002
doesn't help anyone
except India.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.805
And all the secrets
she knows

08:26.807 --> 08:28.540
die with her.
THAPA:
India ordered me

08:28.542 --> 08:29.841
to bring her back alive.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.910
My mission was very clear.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.729
CALLEN:
Missions change.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.547
Sniper could have been
a backup plan.
My handlers

08:35.549 --> 08:37.549
would have told me
about a backup plan.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.719
DEEKS:
Brother, I think you're giving
your handlers too much credit.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.188
CALLEN:
Sniper took a shot
from the fifth floor.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.091
Check it out, start
tracking this guy down.
What about Ella?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.727
Defectors always look
too good to be true.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.097
Some are real; the rest are just
double agents assigned to...

08:52.099 --> 08:54.833
keep us chasing our tails
year after year.
NELL: Sounds like

08:54.835 --> 08:55.901
you've met one before.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.669
I've been one before.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.571
Hetty wants me

08:59.573 --> 09:01.406
to debrief Ella.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.240
I will join you,
Agent Callen.
No.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.844
Your mission
is not Ella anymore.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.712
If that's the case,
why shouldn't I

09:07.714 --> 09:09.281
just board the next plane
back to India?

09:09.283 --> 09:12.117
Because my partner
took a bullet today,

09:12.119 --> 09:13.952
and we need
your help.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.021
Then you have it, sahib.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.089
Let's do it.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.137
Medical team seems
squared away.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.609
You know, Dr. Bates
flew in just for Sam.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.877
I called for help,

09:38.879 --> 09:42.180
and he was on the first chopper
out of Coronado.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.819
How's Michelle holding up?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.255
She's a professional.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.024
The children,
on the other hand,

09:53.026 --> 09:54.626
are another story.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.861
She's explaining it all
to them now.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.265
I don't envy her... that task.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.001
A mother's work is never done.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.070
Michelle is

10:05.072 --> 10:06.705
very strong,

10:06.707 --> 10:07.906
Owen.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.958
Agreed.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.009
But she's not the one
I was talking about.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.059
I think I can see

10:28.061 --> 10:29.995
where the sniper
set up his shot.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.931
I'll check it out before
we go in, all right?
All right.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.901
Listen, you got any, uh,
Gurkha wisdom for me,

10:36.903 --> 10:40.071
'cause Kay-Kay's been fighting
me ever since we woke up.

10:40.073 --> 10:44.009
Fighting since you woke up?
Hold on.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.343
Last time I was here,

10:45.345 --> 10:48.013
you were still trying
to figure out your feelings.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.347
How long since...?

10:49.349 --> 10:50.949
Christmas.
And you've already

10:50.951 --> 10:52.651
moved in together?
No.

10:52.653 --> 10:56.755
Well, I mean, we spend pretty
much every night together,

10:56.757 --> 10:59.958
and, obviously,
every day together.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.993
Are you crazy?
Maybe.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.995
Who moves that fast?

11:03.997 --> 11:07.098
Last time I was here,
I advised you, be patient.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.067
You think we're
moving too fast?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.403
Most new couples do.

11:11.405 --> 11:14.005
Spending every moment
together.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.842
Staging photos
to display their happiness,

11:17.844 --> 11:21.680
introducing them
to friends and family.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.783
It feels real

11:24.785 --> 11:27.919
before it...
it becomes real.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.689
Wow.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.691
You know a lot
about women.

11:32.693 --> 11:36.428
I'm a Gurkha, not a monk.

11:36.430 --> 11:39.130
Yeah. It's definitely on
the fifth floor. Let's go.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.432
Ready to investigate, Kay-Kay.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.967
Oh, no. Mm.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.936
What did he
just call me?

11:44.938 --> 11:47.238
I don't know if his...
Well, I didn't hear it,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.807
'cause there's so much
traffic, and...

11:48.809 --> 11:50.842
There was no traffic.
And the truck came by,

11:50.843 --> 11:52.876
and he honked his...
You think this is a joke?
You think this is funny?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.846
He thinks it's funny,
but he's from Nepal.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.081
You know,
he's got Nepalese humor.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.117
It's very... distinct.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.719
Yeah. (laughs)

12:00.721 --> 12:03.722
See, I'm laughing,
but I'm not finding this funny.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.795
There.
Yeah, there it is.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.163
It's a loop hole.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.165
Could have used
a diamond cutter.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.934
Shooter's definitely a pro.

12:15.936 --> 12:20.205
Yeah, posting up here gives him
every angle on the warehouse.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.141
Prevents him from having to move
from window to window.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.343
And this column-- lots
of protection from return fire.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.911
Yeah.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.446
DEEKS:
Look at that.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.316
Well, that narrows our suspects
down to Einstein, Descartes,

12:31.318 --> 12:33.084
and the guy
from<i> Good Will Hunting.</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:36.121
I mean, wow. Like me

12:36.123 --> 12:39.057
telling Mrs. Powell that never
gonna use algebra in real life.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.393
Ballistic
algorithms.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.828
KENSI:
It's the most advanced
I've ever seen.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.063
Do you recognize it?

12:45.065 --> 12:47.031
I created it.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.168
The only people
in the world

12:50.170 --> 12:52.170
trained to use them...

12:52.172 --> 12:53.805
are Gurkhas.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.459
Is your partner okay?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.132
I want the exact number

13:21.134 --> 13:23.134
of every nuclear warhead
in India's arsenal.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.736
Operational,

13:24.737 --> 13:26.337
decommissioned and under
construction-- every one of 'em.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.339
I already have a handler,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.441
a CIA man named Doug Emmerich.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.313
I'm here, and he's not.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.149
That says something
about the agency's

13:38.151 --> 13:39.317
opinion of you right now.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.052
Scare tactics, Agent Callen?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.388
I think if I wanted
to scare you,

13:43.390 --> 13:45.290
I'd probably have a Gurkha
here right now.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.892
Look, I'm really not trying
to be difficult.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.460
Your partner risked his life

13:49.462 --> 13:51.996
to help me. Please extend
the courtesy of an answer.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.267
Sam Hanna died
on the operating table today.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.205
I'm so sorry, Agent Callen.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.308
So am I.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.345
Agency doesn't like to
get their hands dirty.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.347
They're rethinking
your entire deal.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.915
What does that mean?

14:10.917 --> 14:12.083
Sending you back home,

14:12.085 --> 14:14.235
forgetting this
mess ever happened.

14:14.236 --> 14:16.386
Do you have any idea what
they'll do to me back there?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.356
Look, I'm sorry
about your partner, but...
Stop apologizing

14:18.358 --> 14:21.526
and convince me my partner
didn't die for nothing.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.929
(door opens)

14:24.931 --> 14:26.998
(door closes)

14:30.570 --> 14:32.303
ERIC:
We've got two LAPD detectives

14:32.305 --> 14:33.738
stationed
at the warehouse entrance.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.172
They're keeping it sealed off
for us.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.608
Do you have any news on Sam?

14:36.610 --> 14:38.343
They're still operating on him.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.412
Thanks.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.480
How did the shooter know
exactly the place and time

14:42.482 --> 14:44.282
you were gonna
show up with Ella?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.317
It was a designated
extraction point.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.253
My orders were
to bring her there

14:48.255 --> 14:50.288
and rendezvous with an asset

14:50.290 --> 14:52.290
who would help us
cross the border.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.125
Does this asset have a name?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.361
No name,
just an encrypted number.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.162
I called it the moment

14:58.164 --> 15:00.665
I had Ella,
but it had been disconnected.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.400
You were
right,<i> sahib.</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:07.505
Maybe I'd been giving
my handlers far too much credit.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.340
So, why would they set you up?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.476
I told them
that I would not kill Ella.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.245
There was no Plan B.

15:14.247 --> 15:19.550
Maybe they found a Gurkha
more agreeable than me.

15:19.552 --> 15:20.585
And he's still out there.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.620
We must find him.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.556
I can talk to him,
make sure Ella doesn't get hurt.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.425
He'll listen to me.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.961
DEEKS:
As much as I'd like to
wrap up today with two Gurkhas

15:29.963 --> 15:32.497
singing "Give Peace A Chance"
over a pitcher of beer,

15:32.499 --> 15:35.400
brother, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

15:37.203 --> 15:39.270
Let's check out that warehouse.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.374
(door closes)

15:47.414 --> 15:49.480
You think she's
the real thing?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.118
No one's the real thing.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.455
Some of us just have
fewer lies to tell.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.126
Sam?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.195
He's still in surgery.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.202
Can I ask
for your opinion, Thapa?

16:11.204 --> 16:12.670
Of course, Kay-Kay.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.306
No. He's on my side.
Go find your own Gurkha.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.991
Okay, so,
you're dating someone,

16:16.992 --> 16:18.675
and, uh, you take him
to meet your best friends,

16:18.678 --> 16:20.662
and they completely
freak out.

16:20.663 --> 16:22.647
Kat, Mindy, Mandy, Tiffany, and
Tiffany did not freak me out.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.149
Which leaves you wondering

16:24.150 --> 16:25.650
whether they accept all of you,
or just a part of you.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.385
I don't even know what
you're talking about right now.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.586
Maybe it's insecurity, or...

16:28.588 --> 16:30.154
Okay, insecure because
of<i> Love Actually</i>

16:30.156 --> 16:31.422
and my infinity
for cupcakes?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.041
Obviously defensive.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.659
DEEKS:
You know what you
sound like right now?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.260
You sound crazy.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.696
Which explains
why he just called me

16:38.698 --> 16:41.032
the one thing that no woman
ever wants to be called.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.533
Crazy.
Exactly.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.302
So, what is your opinion?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.636
Yeah, you know what?
Go ahead, go ahead.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.005
Drop a knowledge bomb on us.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.106
We can handle it.
Tell us the truth.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.273
He is a guru.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.709
Watch and learn.
Go for it.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.177
Gurkhas are like monks.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.013
We don't know much
about relationships.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.514
I'm sorry. What?!

16:56.516 --> 16:59.617
My strength lies in listening.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.552
And there it is.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.587
No.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.789
That knowledge.
DEEKS:
No.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.158
If more men
listened like you...
Oh, man.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.760
...less women would be
labeled "crazy."

17:08.762 --> 17:09.761
Indeed.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.396
Thank you.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.065
To be continued,
Your Holiness.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.410
The information
you requested.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.812
I'd like to speak
to Agent Emmerich.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.647
Agent Emmerich is...

17:29.649 --> 17:32.717
Still at his
office at Langley.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.188
You're damaged goods, Ella.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.823
Nobody wants your stink
to rub off on them.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.292
If I could just speak to him
for a few minutes.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.527
You think he's
gonna take your call?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.462
He's ready to cut you
loose, send you home?

17:44.464 --> 17:46.831
And if that happens, my
partner died for plane fare.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.333
You and I want
the same thing.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.403
Now, give me something
to change Emmerich's mind.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.472
I wrote down what you asked.
I need more.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.140
There is no more.
Don't lie to me!

17:56.142 --> 17:57.475
GRANGER:
That's enough, Agent Callen.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.077
I'm not done!
Yes, you are.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.513
It's an order.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.759
(sighs)

18:21.601 --> 18:23.668
(phone ringing)

18:25.171 --> 18:27.171
(sighs)

18:27.173 --> 18:29.173
Talk to me, Eric.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.209
And Agent named Doug Emmerich
is headed your way.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.577
He wants to finalize Ella's deal

18:32.579 --> 18:34.879
and fly her back to Langley
within the hour.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.349
I feel like I already know him.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.854
Kensi.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.522
Kensi, we got
blood on the door.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.665
Oh, this just happened.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.534
Those cuts are really deep.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.668
THAPA:
The work

18:57.670 --> 18:59.704
of a kukri.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.239
(phone ringing through)

19:01.241 --> 19:02.607
ERIC:
Hey, Kens. What's up?

19:02.609 --> 19:03.908
Eric,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.276
both detectives are down.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.911
I repeat,
both detectives are down.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.312
Send backup immediately!

19:08.314 --> 19:09.780
Roger that, I'm on it.

19:20.260 --> 19:24.662
KENSI:
See that?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.830
We should pull
back,<i> sahib.</i>

19:25.832 --> 19:27.665
That's not an option.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.499
By the time backup shows up,
our guy could be gone.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.635
Ready?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.669
One,

19:31.671 --> 19:32.904
two...

19:32.906 --> 19:34.172
Wait! Wait!

19:34.174 --> 19:35.239
Federal agents!

19:35.241 --> 19:37.275
(rapid gunfire)

19:38.411 --> 19:40.178
Well, it's definitely
more than one shooter.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.555
We got to get out
of this choke point.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.325
They knew we were coming.
We must keep moving.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.493
(grunts)

19:55.495 --> 19:56.460
DEEKS:
Moving on three.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.229
One, two...

19:58.231 --> 19:58.963
(rapid gunfire)

19:58.965 --> 20:00.498
(grunting)

20:00.500 --> 20:02.733
(rapid gunfire)

20:12.645 --> 20:14.245
You guys smell that?

20:14.246 --> 20:15.846
Yeah. Gasoline.
DEEKS:
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.615
They just funneled us
right into a...

20:17.617 --> 20:18.749
Center of a bomb.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.320
(men speaking in Nepalese)

20:22.322 --> 20:24.388
(doors closing)

20:25.959 --> 20:28.259
Listen.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.363
They're gone.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.365
No detonation cord.

20:34.367 --> 20:38.236
They're going to set off
the explosion manually,

20:38.238 --> 20:40.238
which means they've left
someone behind.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.340
And one shot,
and we're Kentucky Fried.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.009
All right, so,
where is he?

20:50.984 --> 20:53.384
There's only one place someone
could detonate this bomb

20:53.386 --> 20:55.419
and not kill themselves
in the process.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.855
THAPA:
Open fire

20:57.856 --> 21:00.290
this close to the gas,
and you will do the job for him.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.180
(grunts)

21:05.181 --> 21:05.997
(shouts)

21:05.999 --> 21:07.798
(moaning)

21:07.800 --> 21:11.335
Like a boss.

21:11.337 --> 21:12.770
KENSI:
Let's go.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.347
The rest of the
team cleared out.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.884
(speaking Nepali)

21:35.295 --> 21:39.563
I haven't been a Gurkha
for years.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.400
Just another killer for hire
now.

21:43.369 --> 21:46.037
Once brothers,

21:46.039 --> 21:48.506
always brothers.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.008
Even now?

21:53.579 --> 21:56.447
Especially now, my friend.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.787
Ella betrayed India,
but she's not the target.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.789
She never was.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.726
You are.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.451
ERIC:
We cross-referenced the pics
of the dead Gurkhas

22:33.453 --> 22:36.787
against military databases
in India, England, and Nepal.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.122
NELL:
These Gurkhas were

22:38.124 --> 22:41.592
dishonorably discharged
within the last five years.

22:41.594 --> 22:46.364
Various charges include
assault, theft, and narcotics.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.366
In many ways,
Gurkhas are special.

22:48.368 --> 22:51.068
In others, we are
as human as anyone else.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.803
So what do these Gurkhas do
after they're discharged?

22:52.805 --> 22:54.905
ERIC:
Private military
contracting work.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.073
NELL:
Hunting

22:56.075 --> 22:58.409
high value targets,
interrogations,

22:58.411 --> 23:00.845
countersurveillance
for VIP clients.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.980
So essentially the same thing
they're doing in the military

23:02.982 --> 23:06.083
but with more money
and less oversight.
And now

23:06.085 --> 23:07.685
there's a team of them
running loose in L.A.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.153
Great. Thanks.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.555
ERIC:
Not a problem.
So I get why players in India

23:11.557 --> 23:13.758
want Ella dead. They got
the intel to find her,

23:13.760 --> 23:15.559
they got resources
to hire ex-Gurkhas.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.896
What I don't understand is why
they would target you instead.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.433
I have been asking myself
the same question, sahib.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.435
My handlers believed
that this mission

23:24.437 --> 23:27.071
would be suicide
for anyone else.
Well, they're right.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.774
I mean, you're loyal and lethal.
That's a rare combo.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.075
Which is all the more reason
why they should help you

23:31.077 --> 23:32.610
get back safely.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.945
I have many questions.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.782
I would like
to see how Ella answers them.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.717
I'll call Callen.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.653
(line ringing)

23:42.655 --> 23:45.523
I don't approve of how
Agent Callen's handling this,

23:45.525 --> 23:47.591
but he's your best
shot at getting back

23:47.593 --> 23:49.059
in the CIA's good graces.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.861
I told him
what he wanted to know.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.099
So I took a look at your count
of India's nuclear warheads...

23:55.101 --> 23:56.767
It's completely accurate.

23:58.137 --> 24:01.806
In 2008, an American infiltrated
India's nuclear agency,

24:01.808 --> 24:04.842
came back with an exact tally
of their nuclear weapons.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.644
That was a popular rumor
in my office.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.845
Thank you for confirming it.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.680
India was informed
after the fact.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.081
It was a show of good faith
and a friendly reminder

24:11.083 --> 24:12.850
of who really runs things.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.852
What's your point?
Well, according
to you,

24:14.854 --> 24:17.488
that tally hasn't changed
in seven years.
You're assuming

24:17.490 --> 24:19.857
the number circulated back then
was accurate.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.725
It was accurate.
How can you be

24:21.727 --> 24:22.960
absolutely sure?
Callen brought back

24:22.962 --> 24:24.895
the tally in the first place.

24:26.132 --> 24:31.235
The tally I gave you in 2008
remains accurate today.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.903
You're lying.
India's not

24:32.905 --> 24:34.538
mass-producing nuclear missiles.

24:34.539 --> 24:36.172
Is it that hard to believe
the number stayed flat?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.508
I went
back again

24:37.510 --> 24:38.776
last year.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.744
The number of nuclear warheads
has doubled.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.847
And I'm the one who sent him.

24:42.849 --> 24:43.914
How much
disinformation

24:43.916 --> 24:45.783
have you already fed the CIA?

24:45.785 --> 24:46.851
(door opens)

24:47.820 --> 24:49.186
What the hell is this?

24:49.188 --> 24:50.054
CALLEN:
A debriefing,

24:50.056 --> 24:52.490
Agent Emmerich.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.925
I'll debrief my own asset,
thank you very much.
I hope you brought

24:54.927 --> 24:55.793
a polygraph.

24:55.795 --> 24:56.827
Your
partner

24:56.829 --> 24:58.162
just came out of surgery.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.231
He made it.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.765
The CIA
thanks you

25:01.767 --> 25:03.834
for helping our asset
come in safely.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.002
Now go home.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.237
And you're
calling me

25:06.239 --> 25:08.138
a liar?

25:12.778 --> 25:14.778
She's not who she says she is.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.280
Take it up

25:16.282 --> 25:18.282
with the White House.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.551
Don't say I
didn't warn you.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.890
(door shuts)

25:26.859 --> 25:29.126
Just heard about Sam.
Yeah, thank God.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.795
It's the first good thing that's
happened today. We needed it.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.898
That's
Ella's CIA contact,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.833
Doug Emmerich.
KENSI:
Is he open

25:35.835 --> 25:36.934
to working with us?

25:37.937 --> 25:40.738
Guessing not.
I didn't
exactly make

25:40.740 --> 25:42.873
the best first impression.
It's still early,

25:42.875 --> 25:46.310
but that's my pick for
Understatement of the Year.
No case officer wants

25:46.312 --> 25:48.979
to find out that
his newest asset might be fake.

25:48.981 --> 25:49.813
What do you mean?

25:49.815 --> 25:51.015
I don't trust her.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.683
Every once in a while
she'll hand out

25:52.685 --> 25:54.685
some real intel,
but mostly it'll just be lies.

25:54.687 --> 25:55.586
And
while Langley's

25:55.588 --> 25:56.787
spinning
their wheels,

25:56.788 --> 25:57.987
she's reporting everything
she sees

25:57.990 --> 25:59.690
back to her handlers in India.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.927
(speaks indistinctly)

26:10.670 --> 26:12.303
My name is
Jemadar Thapa.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.605
Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm aware

26:14.607 --> 26:17.207
you're escorting Ella Desai
back to her new home.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.809
I was wondering

26:18.811 --> 26:19.643
if I could...

26:19.645 --> 26:20.644
have just
a few minutes

26:20.646 --> 26:21.845
with her.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.683
You can trust
him, Emmerich.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.686
Who's gonna guarantee that?

26:28.688 --> 26:29.920
I will.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.825
(door opens)

26:35.795 --> 26:38.662
Why do you look scared?

26:38.664 --> 26:40.931
She's not scared, sahib.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.133
She's surprised

26:43.135 --> 26:44.969
I'm still alive.

26:44.971 --> 26:45.970
Aren't you?

26:45.972 --> 26:47.871
I don't know what you mean.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.974
Why are you really here?

26:49.976 --> 26:52.876
You know why.

26:52.878 --> 26:56.113
Enough of this. Someone
call Agent Emmerich.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.916
Tell me the truth.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.018
Get control of him.
He's under
control.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.687
Right, Thapa?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.222
Why was I betrayed?!

27:05.223 --> 27:06.756
Why are Gurkhas trying
to kill me?!
Get off me!

27:06.759 --> 27:08.258
Why did my people
lie to me?!

27:08.260 --> 27:09.960
Why am I really here?!

27:09.962 --> 27:11.061
EMMERICH:
All right, as of
now, this task force

27:11.063 --> 27:12.329
is over.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.931
If Thapa comes
within ten feet

27:13.933 --> 27:15.866
of my asset again, he will spend
the rest of his life

27:15.868 --> 27:17.001
in a black site prison.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.636
We need him for this case.

27:18.638 --> 27:19.737
You don't have a case anymore.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.812
(door shuts)

27:51.037 --> 27:53.303
Never heard this
place so quiet.

27:57.443 --> 28:01.812
I think we've all had
enough guns for one day, sahib.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.883
How you holding up?

28:05.885 --> 28:09.753
Thinking of my wife
and children.

28:09.755 --> 28:12.356
My home.

28:12.358 --> 28:16.260
The uncertainty
that waits for me back in India.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.464
Well, you know you always got
a home here, right?

28:20.466 --> 28:24.268
I've been walking
the warrior's path for so long

28:24.270 --> 28:29.073
that home isn't a place anymore.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.709
It is a feeling.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.777
What do you mean?
What do you mean, a feeling?

28:33.779 --> 28:34.778
It is

28:34.780 --> 28:36.847
my wife's smile.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.382
My children's laughter.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.917
The friendship

28:39.919 --> 28:41.785
I never expected.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.821
I built
my home

28:43.823 --> 28:44.955
on these feelings

28:44.957 --> 28:47.224
so I would never have to leave.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.728
So home is not in the heart.

28:50.730 --> 28:54.264
Home... is the heart.

28:54.266 --> 28:59.470
One day,
I won't be a Gurkha anymore.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.872
I will be a feeling.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.341
Now
you'll know

29:04.343 --> 29:06.143
where to find me.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.814
We got to talk
about your handlers.

29:10.816 --> 29:14.151
They hung you
out to dry.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.820
There is something else
a warrior carries

29:16.822 --> 29:18.756
in their heart, sahib.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.059
An expiration date.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.996
(chuckles)
Yeah, well, there's nothing we
can do about that though, right?

29:25.998 --> 29:28.832
And yet we spend our lives

29:28.834 --> 29:32.136
trying to do so many things
about it,

29:32.138 --> 29:35.139
when all we really need to be

29:35.141 --> 29:37.775
is ready.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.113
Yeah.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.083
Just heard from
the hospital.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.085
A nurse said Sam's
asking for you.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.353
Then let's make this quick.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.554
The CIA has
confirmed

29:50.556 --> 29:53.824
Ella's deal.
She's America's newest prize.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.926
NELL:
And I just
got a copy

29:55.928 --> 29:58.262
of Emmerich's initial report
to Langley.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.898
In his words,
"if India sent Thapa

30:00.900 --> 30:02.900
"after Ella,
then she's valuable.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.903
"If she's valuable, then the
terrorists want what she knows.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.172
"Thapa was likely targeted
because of his proximity

30:08.174 --> 30:09.373
"to this agency's

30:09.375 --> 30:11.542
new asset."
Well, now
that Ella's safely

30:11.544 --> 30:15.412
in CIA custody, there's no
longer motivation to kill Thapa.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.349
On paper, it's logical.
ERIC:
Since when do terrorists

30:19.351 --> 30:22.052
hire ex-Gurkhas
to do their dirty work?
KENSI: All this effort

30:22.054 --> 30:24.288
for a woman you never trusted
in the first place.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.958
I have to make a stop
before we go to the hospital.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.966
It was a...

30:35.968 --> 30:38.101
traumatic wound,
but Sam is expected

30:38.103 --> 30:40.137
to make a full recovery.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.239
I can't say
the same

30:42.241 --> 30:43.841
about you

30:43.843 --> 30:46.977
and your relations with the CIA.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.581
Ella's a double agent, Hetty.

30:52.518 --> 30:56.053
Associates of mine
in India's parliament

30:56.055 --> 30:58.288
are also skeptical,

30:58.290 --> 31:02.125
but events seem to
indicate otherwise.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.128
A bullet to Sam's chest,
the lives of two detectives

31:05.130 --> 31:09.533
were only part of the price
to secure her.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.535
The price was high.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.971
But what if that was the plan
from the beginning?

31:13.973 --> 31:16.940
Inserting a spy
inside the CIA

31:16.942 --> 31:18.408
is almost impossible.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.878
Unless that spy appears
to be valuable,

31:20.880 --> 31:23.013
so valuable
that you're willing to ignore

31:23.015 --> 31:24.314
obvious risks.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.515
How would
India

31:25.517 --> 31:28.518
create the appearance
of such value?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.220
Send an elite operative
like Thapa

31:30.222 --> 31:32.256
on a mission
to-to bring back Ella.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.892
Hire another group to kill Thapa

31:34.894 --> 31:37.194
on behalf of some rogue group
that doesn't exist.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.962
The more casualties
that pile up,

31:38.964 --> 31:40.464
the more valuable Ella appears.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.332
Suddenly, she's a hot commodity.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.934
CIA has to have her.

31:46.672 --> 31:50.374
The spy game has more in common
with selling used cars

31:50.376 --> 31:52.676
than any of us would like
to admit.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.946
Unfortunately,
it's just a theory.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.414
It's too little,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.483
it's too late, I have no proof.

32:00.653 --> 32:03.353
Everyone's already
made up their minds.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.991
Changing minds is hard.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.428
A good car salesman

32:11.430 --> 32:13.430
wouldn't even attempt it.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.934
Instead, he changes
the customer's

32:16.936 --> 32:20.971
definition of value.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.012
(rhythmic beeping)

32:30.316 --> 32:32.516
Welcome back,
Agent Hanna.

32:34.019 --> 32:36.086
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

32:37.189 --> 32:39.656
How long was I out?

32:39.658 --> 32:42.125
Not long.
You've got company.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.229
Hey.

32:46.231 --> 32:48.231
Please tell me
somebody disinfected Deeks

32:48.233 --> 32:50.167
before they let him in here.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.535
(Kensi laughs)

32:51.537 --> 32:53.003
BATES:
He's not supposed to have

32:53.005 --> 32:54.571
visitors until tomorrow,

32:54.573 --> 32:57.074
but I'll look the other
way for a few minutes.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.743
CALLEN:
Thank you, Doctor.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.145
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

33:03.716 --> 33:06.416
(door opening)

33:06.418 --> 33:09.019
(door closes)
What happened to Ella?

33:09.021 --> 33:10.287
(phone ringing)

33:10.289 --> 33:12.222
It's a long story.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.590
What's up, Eric?

33:13.592 --> 33:16.093
Doctors wouldn't
let me talk before.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.228
Something I wanted

33:18.230 --> 33:19.296
to tell you.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.098
Tell me what?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.668
Before I got shot,

33:24.670 --> 33:27.771
Ella-- she put a

33:27.773 --> 33:30.107
GPS tracking beacon on him.

33:38.283 --> 33:39.750
KENSI:
Okay.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.618
Just one second.
Guys, we have a problem. Eric,

33:41.620 --> 33:42.786
repeat what you said to me.

33:42.788 --> 33:45.022
LAPD just got a call
from a woman

33:45.024 --> 33:46.490
named Cecilia Ramos.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.092
Her sister never showed up
for work today.

33:49.094 --> 33:51.294
She got worried,
started looking for her.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.529
Where does her sister work?

33:52.531 --> 33:53.764
Maria Ramos was a nurse

33:53.766 --> 33:55.198
at the hospital
you're at right now.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.700
What do you mean "was"?

33:56.702 --> 34:00.037
Police just found her body
in the trunk of her car.

34:00.039 --> 34:03.106
Throat slit,
nurse's uniform missing.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.375
CALLEN:
Eric, we need backup now.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.377
Get this building locked down.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.383
What's the situation?

34:13.385 --> 34:14.618
It's bad.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.554
When you say "bad"...
<i>Very</i> bad.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.722
Getting shot

34:18.724 --> 34:20.290
is very bad.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.092
Your cooking is very bad.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.326
Granger after

34:23.328 --> 34:24.494
two drinks is very bad.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.063
I need you
to be more specific, G.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.664
You remember the time
we fought Thapa?

34:27.666 --> 34:31.368
Oh, angry Gurkha rates
very, very bad on the

34:31.370 --> 34:34.404
Hanna scale of bad
people, places and things.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.373
We got six of 'em
coming our way.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.700
No.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.511
MAN:
Who are you?

35:14.513 --> 35:15.846
What's going on?

35:15.848 --> 35:17.347
Shh.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.416
It's okay.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.864
(panting)

35:36.135 --> 35:37.868
(gasps)

35:52.651 --> 35:54.618
(speaking native language)

35:55.420 --> 35:57.487
(man yelling)

35:57.489 --> 36:00.891
(grunting)

36:00.893 --> 36:04.528
(speaking native language,
grunting)

36:08.901 --> 36:11.334
(grunting continues)

36:15.340 --> 36:16.806
(grunting)

36:19.711 --> 36:22.579
(sighs, grunts)

36:22.581 --> 36:23.413
(grunting)

36:23.415 --> 36:25.348
(grunts)

36:25.350 --> 36:27.951
(grunting)

36:29.888 --> 36:31.621
(grunting and panting)

36:31.623 --> 36:32.822
(loud grunting)

36:32.824 --> 36:33.924
Deeks!

36:33.926 --> 36:35.825
Got this! (groans)

36:35.827 --> 36:38.662
(grunting)

36:38.664 --> 36:40.564
Son of a...

36:40.566 --> 36:41.898
(grunting)

36:41.900 --> 36:43.400
THAPA:
Callen!

36:43.402 --> 36:44.734
Hostile headed your way!

36:44.736 --> 36:46.203
(grunting)

36:46.205 --> 36:48.538
Let her go.
I'll open her throat.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.873
(woman groans)

36:49.875 --> 36:51.408
Stick with him.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.542
It's exactly what he wants.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.744
Save that hostage, G.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.680
Do it!

36:56.682 --> 36:58.915
(woman groaning)

37:02.421 --> 37:04.754
(grunts)

37:04.756 --> 37:05.989
(grunts)

37:05.991 --> 37:07.524
(loud grunting)

37:07.526 --> 37:09.960
(loud grunting)

37:09.962 --> 37:11.861
(grunts)

37:11.863 --> 37:13.830
(loud grunting)

37:13.832 --> 37:15.365
(groans)

37:15.367 --> 37:16.533
(groaning)

37:16.535 --> 37:17.867
(woman whimpers)

37:17.869 --> 37:19.936
(man grunting)

37:23.775 --> 37:24.975
Thapa took a bullet.

37:24.977 --> 37:28.511
What? No.

37:28.513 --> 37:32.549
It's not your expiration date,

37:32.551 --> 37:34.851
Sam. (groans)

37:34.853 --> 37:36.553
DEEKS:
It's okay. Look at me.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.821
It's-it's just
like last time.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.723
I'm gonna get you fixed up,
we take you home.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.524
I'm already there.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.792
KENSI:
Here, Deeks.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.294
(Thapa breathes raspy breaths)

37:44.296 --> 37:45.929
DEEKS:
You're gonna stay with me.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.364
You stay with me.

37:47.366 --> 37:52.335
Look for me in smiles,<i> sahib.</i>

37:52.337 --> 37:54.471
You'll see me

37:54.473 --> 37:58.808
waving back at you.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.778
Thapa.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.881
Buddy.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.284
Deeks.
Thapa.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.953
(rhythmic beeping)

38:09.955 --> 38:12.022
He's gone.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.796
What's Param Vir Chakra?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.632
You must be eager
to lose your job, Agent Callen.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.534
Param Vir Chakra.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.670
I guess I could just
look it up online.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.872
It's India's highest
military honor.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.674
Param Vir Chakra translates

38:30.676 --> 38:32.709
to "Wheel of
the Ultimate Brave."

38:32.711 --> 38:35.845
Wow. Well, they just awarded
it to Thapa posthumously

38:35.847 --> 38:38.415
for extraordinary valor
and self-sacrifice

38:38.417 --> 38:40.050
in defense of
his country.

38:40.052 --> 38:43.486
India's also investigating
a rogue group of spies

38:43.488 --> 38:46.756
for running unauthorized ops
against America.

38:46.758 --> 38:51.061
Extremists that took advantage
of a certain Gurkha's loyalty.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.862
And?

38:52.864 --> 38:56.733
And we know about the
tracker you placed on Thapa.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.502
The CIA is not
bailing you out, so,

38:59.504 --> 39:01.571
if you ever want
to see daylight again...

39:03.875 --> 39:06.009
...you are going to list

39:06.011 --> 39:08.545
every one of their names,

39:08.547 --> 39:11.047
numbers and addresses

39:11.049 --> 39:13.049
before the night's done.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.085
So you can pay them a visit?

39:33.939 --> 39:35.972
How are you holding up?

39:35.974 --> 39:39.376
Yeah, I've been, uh...
I've been better.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.646
Your place or mine?

39:43.648 --> 39:45.815
Um...

39:45.817 --> 39:48.485
you know, I-I was
thinking about that,

39:48.487 --> 39:50.920
and I was thinking
that maybe we should, um...

39:51.857 --> 39:53.156
I don't know.
Maybe we should

39:53.158 --> 39:54.924
take a night off
every now and then.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.096
I'm so glad you said that.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.132
Really?

40:03.668 --> 40:05.969
Then why didn't you just
say it first?

40:05.971 --> 40:07.971
Because we had that stupid first
official fight this morning.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.139
Well, it can't be

40:09.141 --> 40:10.740
our first official fight,

40:10.742 --> 40:12.909
'cause I don't even remember
what it was about.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.445
I remember exactly
what it was about.

40:15.447 --> 40:18.882
Well, I have completely
forgotten it, Kay-Kay.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.454
Are you okay?

40:24.456 --> 40:27.991
Yeah, I was just thinking about
what Thapa told me about smiles.

40:27.993 --> 40:31.995
He said that smiles are, um...

40:34.966 --> 40:36.966
Never mind.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.968
I will, uh...

40:38.970 --> 40:40.937
I'll tell you later.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.939
All right.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.008
So, um,

40:45.010 --> 40:46.976
getting through
our first fight's

40:46.978 --> 40:48.945
a pretty big deal, right?
I'd say

40:48.947 --> 40:50.947
it's pretty huge.
I mean, some would argue

40:50.949 --> 40:54.551
that this would be
a call for celebration.

40:54.553 --> 40:57.921
Huh. But not...
not tonight.
Well,

40:57.923 --> 40:59.756
no, not to quote
the Fairy Godmother,

40:59.758 --> 41:00.924
but, technically,
"tonight" ends

41:00.926 --> 41:03.026
when the clock
strikes midnight, so...

41:05.931 --> 41:09.199
Just... just call me
if you want to talk.

41:11.536 --> 41:13.636
What?

41:13.638 --> 41:16.239
Your smile is so perfect.

41:20.946 --> 41:23.746
And there it is.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.783
Good night.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.819
You should go home.

41:33.959 --> 41:35.959
I'm already there.
