00:45.833 --> 00:48.583
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I can't explain it.

00:48.708 --> 00:52.458
You can't explain it.
You can't explain it...

00:52.583 --> 00:54.375
You can't explain it...
You will explain it.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
No, I can't. Really.

01:00.084 --> 01:02.625
How could you do this,
so soon after the accident?

01:02.750 --> 01:04.958
It wasn't an accident, Catherine.
It was on purpose.

01:05.084 --> 01:09.084
And besides... this over-reliance
has been suffocating.

01:11.084 --> 01:12.875
How soon after did you start seeing her?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.376
- That's a ridiculous question.
- Well, answer it.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.500
Before...

01:17.625 --> 01:19.625
"Before..."

01:21.416 --> 01:23.792
"Before"?

01:23.917 --> 01:27.458
- Can we please just relax?
- No we can't "please just"...

01:27.583 --> 01:28.750
I'm pleading with you here.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.792
Well, you don't get any pleas,
you piece of shit.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.875
- I hate you.
- So, this shouldn't be too painful.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.209
No, it shouldn't. It's just one more thing
on top of everything else.

01:39.334 --> 01:41.000
It's just one more thing.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.750
You're being dramatic.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.375
My father was my life,
and my family was my life.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.416
And then you were a part of both,
and now...

01:48.541 --> 01:50.583
Now I hate you.

01:50.708 --> 01:53.333
Now I hate you, you dishonest sneak!

01:53.458 --> 01:55.042
I'm not looking for you
to understand me here.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.458
Well, good, because there's no chance
of that happening.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.500
I just think that you've been misdirecting
a lot of anger towards me,

01:59.625 --> 02:00.666
the past few months,
and I can't take it...

02:00.792 --> 02:05.583
Oh, good for you. I'm glad
that you've figured that out. Good.

02:06.208 --> 02:09.125
Feel better? Good.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.583
Don't you think we've got to the place

02:10.708 --> 02:13.583
where we rely on each other too much
for it to be healthy?

02:13.708 --> 02:15.708
Do not try to...

02:15.833 --> 02:17.875
justify this, as some sort of effort
to help me

02:18.000 --> 02:21.416
or save me, like you're doing me
a fucking favour!

02:21.541 --> 02:23.958
Like I should thank you!

02:24.708 --> 02:27.292
It's not untrue.

02:27.416 --> 02:30.416
No. It's not untrue.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.291
Just go. Just go.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.583
I don't want you seeing me like this.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.708
Go. Please. Just leave me alone.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.833
Please, just leave me alone.

02:58.042 --> 02:59.666
Go!

04:01.083 --> 04:03.167
Why are you walking?

04:03.291 --> 04:05.291
I didn't feel like waiting.

04:06.791 --> 04:09.416
It's, like, two miles to the house.

04:14.249 --> 04:15.750
Catherine...

04:15.875 --> 04:17.500
Hey...

04:32.167 --> 04:35.166
Thanks for the exile.

04:35.291 --> 04:38.291
That's what this place is here for.

04:42.791 --> 04:45.666
What's happening with your apartment?

04:45.791 --> 04:48.000
He's moving out while I'm here.

04:49.166 --> 04:52.000
And that is it.

05:31.042 --> 05:33.042
All right.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.917
- Your regular room awaits.
- Oh...

07:49.124 --> 07:51.666
Everything feels so close to me.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.791
Like the good and the bad.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.166
Well, things aren't so bad right now,
though.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.541
No...

08:02.666 --> 08:05.666
You're absolutely right, Virginia.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.499
They're worse.

08:09.624 --> 08:12.624
They're much, much worse.

08:15.124 --> 08:18.124
Well, there's nothing
you can do about that now, so...

08:20.458 --> 08:22.957
- You may as well...
- He must've really suffered, you know.

08:23.082 --> 08:25.833
My father.

08:25.957 --> 08:27.833
He was afflicted.

08:27.957 --> 08:33.291
People say that depression is a sickness,
but I never thought of it that way.

08:33.416 --> 08:36.624
I always just thought of it
as one of his problems.

08:37.791 --> 08:40.457
Just like work or money are problems,
you know.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.624
Now that's he's gone,
it's all I can think about.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.666
Goddammit, you're gonna make me throw up.

09:40.124 --> 09:42.999
Can't a guy fix a cup of java
for his special lady?

09:44.915 --> 09:47.082
What would happen if you broke up?

09:47.957 --> 09:50.332
She'd have to fix her own coffee.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.833
I'm not joking.
You seem crippingly codependent.

09:52.957 --> 09:54.999
- No, we don't?
- "We"?

09:55.124 --> 09:56.749
You just said...
Well, why did you say "we"?

09:56.874 --> 10:01.124
I'm talking about you.
There's no "we" in this scenario.

10:01.249 --> 10:04.040
You sound like SmÃ©agol.

10:07.082 --> 10:10.416
Ginny... Why so negative?

10:11.249 --> 10:14.666
Only my closest friends call me Ginny.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.666
Virginia.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.999
- Why so negative?
- I don't know, James.

10:22.124 --> 10:25.374
Hey, you said, remember?
We were gonna have a nice morning.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.915
You can't force anyone
to have a nice morning.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.458
Yes, you can.

10:31.416 --> 10:33.541
I wasn't speaking to you.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.082
Well, now you're speaking to me.

10:55.874 --> 10:57.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.957
I thought you were asleep. I went out.

11:03.082 --> 11:05.541
- I couldn't sleep.
- It's so quiet here.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.957
Exactly.

11:16.541 --> 11:18.207
That looks good.

11:18.332 --> 11:19.416
I'm rusty.

11:19.541 --> 11:21.749
What?

11:21.874 --> 11:24.166
I said I'm rusty.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.915
Oh...

11:29.624 --> 11:33.666
- Where'd you get these?
- I went to the store.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.249
What, do you think
I brought all of that with me?

11:36.374 --> 11:37.915
The store's, like, four miles.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.790
Well, I just started walking
and then I was there.

13:45.082 --> 13:47.707
Please don't say that.

13:48.582 --> 13:52.999
Because I won't stand to be treated
by you that way, anymore. That's why.

13:55.332 --> 13:57.040
I don't care about that!

13:57.165 --> 13:59.999
And that is insulting to the both of us.

14:01.957 --> 14:03.165
I have to go. She's watching me.

14:12.207 --> 14:13.124
Don't ask.

14:13.249 --> 14:14.915
Was that James?

14:15.040 --> 14:18.165
Does "don't ask" mean something different
where you're from?

14:18.290 --> 14:21.499
- We're from the same place.
- I'd really rather not.

14:30.915 --> 14:33.915
I wasn't sure if you were still in here.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.748
Where else would I be?

14:37.873 --> 14:40.332
You want to go for a walk or something?

14:40.457 --> 14:42.165
It's nice out.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.457
My face hurts.

14:45.581 --> 14:47.207
How do you mean?

14:49.416 --> 14:52.541
Can you please not make me talk
right now? I'm sorry.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.040
What are you doing in here?

14:58.457 --> 15:00.457
What do you mean?

15:00.581 --> 15:01.581
What are you doing?

15:01.707 --> 15:04.082
Like... actually?

15:04.207 --> 15:07.374
It's all dark in here.

15:07.499 --> 15:10.416
I'm hiding.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.540
From what?

15:39.665 --> 15:44.040
It drives me crazy that places like this
are so close to the city.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.581
- Places like this?
- Yeah, you know...

15:46.707 --> 15:50.706
Where tranquillity isn't just a myth.

15:51.581 --> 15:54.540
You can come here
any time my family isn't using it.

15:54.665 --> 15:57.498
Any time, Ginny? Labor Day?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.581
Memorial Day? Fourth of July?

16:00.249 --> 16:04.498
- I told you not to call me Ginny.
- He's joking.

16:04.623 --> 16:07.207
Well, some jokes make me
feel uncomfortable.

16:12.124 --> 16:15.124
- This is my fault.
- No. Not really.

16:15.249 --> 16:17.416
Can we not do this, please?
I thought we came here to relax.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.249
Or at least I did. I don't know...

16:19.374 --> 16:21.374
about what you two are doing.

16:24.915 --> 16:29.540
Well, relaxing or having a vacation would
imply that, at some point, it might end.

16:29.665 --> 16:32.165
So, you can't really get away from it all,
if that's all you're doing, you know.

16:32.290 --> 16:35.998
Then you're just... a bum.
Are you a bum, Ginny?

16:36.124 --> 16:39.498
What a stupid, shitty thing to say.
I don't care at all about going back.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.290
And in fact, now that I think about it,
I'd... just as soon not.

16:42.415 --> 16:44.581
Right. B-U-M, bum.

16:44.706 --> 16:46.165
Just mind your own business, Your Majesty.

16:46.290 --> 16:49.415
OK, um...

16:49.540 --> 16:52.040
- Where are you going?
- I'm just gonna, uh...

16:52.165 --> 16:53.249
give you two a little space.

16:53.374 --> 16:54.998
Not necessary. We're fine.

16:55.124 --> 16:57.498
Still gonna just... excuse myself.

16:57.623 --> 17:00.622
- Please don't.
- Yeah, please don't.

17:01.915 --> 17:04.665
Thank you. That was very mature.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.790
What's it like, having all the answers,
all the time, to everything?

17:09.249 --> 17:12.290
- Must be such a luxury?
- It is. Immeasurably.

17:12.414 --> 17:14.165
Please don't do this.

17:14.290 --> 17:15.665
I mean...

17:15.790 --> 17:18.665
It's not the end of the world,
but could you at least acknowledge

17:18.790 --> 17:21.623
that you never stopped to think about
what I might have wanted from this trip?

17:21.748 --> 17:23.705
Are you calling me a lousy friend?

17:23.832 --> 17:25.998
Are you saying that you're a lousy friend?

17:26.124 --> 17:28.623
I don't know what you want me to say.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.915
I love you more than anything,
you stupid brat.

17:32.915 --> 17:35.082
Well, we should trade places.

17:35.207 --> 17:37.207
See how we feel then.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.456
- Oh, sorry.
- It's OK.

18:07.581 --> 18:09.998
Guys, this is Rich.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.790
His parents have a place next door.

18:11.915 --> 18:14.165
- Hey.
- Hey, Rich. I'm James. Nice to meet you.

18:14.290 --> 18:17.581
- How was lunch?
- Fine.

18:18.256 --> 18:21.422
- So, you live next door, Rich?
- Yeah.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.957
- How long you had the place?
- Oh, a long time.

18:24.082 --> 18:26.332
- Long time...
- Yeah. Before my folks...

18:26.456 --> 18:29.456
- Do you want a beer?
- Sure. Thanks.

18:30.998 --> 18:32.373
Well, no, we should...

18:32.498 --> 18:34.082
We should go.

18:34.207 --> 18:36.748
- No. Hang out. Seriously.
- Let's hang out.

18:36.873 --> 18:39.706
Come on. Have a seat.

18:39.831 --> 18:41.831
Let's have a drink.

18:46.623 --> 18:49.290
I don't know when the last time
we took a vacation was.

18:49.414 --> 18:51.331
Well, I travel a lot for work, so...

18:53.665 --> 18:57.572
- What do you do, Catherine?
- I manage my father's business.

18:59.082 --> 19:01.414
- That sounds, like, suspicious, right?
- Mm...

19:01.540 --> 19:04.873
Catherine's father is a prominent
New York "artiste".

19:04.998 --> 19:09.456
- Oh... Have I heard of him?
- I doubt it.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.831
He built that giant sculpture
in Union Square.

19:11.957 --> 19:14.539
Oh, <i>The Perisphere</i> ?

19:14.665 --> 19:19.248
- Mm...
- "Mm...", what? I know some shit.

19:20.414 --> 19:22.414
- I didn't expect it.
- So, what do you do?

19:22.539 --> 19:25.331
Do you monitor <i>The Perisphere</i> ?

19:25.456 --> 19:28.373
Polish <i>The Perisphere</i> ?

19:28.498 --> 19:30.957
- I manage his affairs.
- Clerical work.

19:31.082 --> 19:34.331
No, it's not. I mean, it's not paperwork.

19:34.456 --> 19:37.207
It's not? Why do you always
have those paper cuts?

19:37.331 --> 19:41.123
It's responsible work.

19:41.249 --> 19:43.082
It's dull.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.915
See, Catherine is this great artist.

19:46.040 --> 19:51.331
But... she's hiding in her father's shadow,
afraid to break out on her own.

19:51.456 --> 19:55.414
Thank you, but it is responsible work
and I very much enjoy doing it.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.289
She's, basically, his assistant.

19:57.414 --> 20:01.123
Well, I don't see that there's
anything wrong with being an assistant

20:01.248 --> 20:03.748
to one of our great living artists.

20:03.873 --> 20:06.289
And how many people did you beat out
to win that great position?

20:06.414 --> 20:09.873
I would tell you, but I don't think you would
understand the concept of a job interview.

20:09.998 --> 20:12.414
You're killing me.

20:12.539 --> 20:14.665
- Please, don't talk to me like that.
- Like what?

20:14.790 --> 20:16.998
Like you're superior to me,
or to any of us.

20:17.123 --> 20:18.581
Why not?

20:18.706 --> 20:21.247
Um... because it's dull.

20:21.373 --> 20:23.247
And it's uninteresting.

20:23.373 --> 20:25.539
Well, we all can't live
in a magical fantasy land.

20:25.665 --> 20:26.706
Uh...

20:26.831 --> 20:29.040
I think if you use your imagination,
you can have a pretty good time.

20:29.165 --> 20:31.040
I think that is an incredibly...

20:31.165 --> 20:35.165
ignorant and childish thing to say.

20:36.206 --> 20:38.581
OK...

20:38.706 --> 20:40.998
Well, I don't know.

20:41.123 --> 20:43.414
I just don't think I was built
for that kind of nonsense.

20:43.539 --> 20:48.123
I think I was made to be a member
of the modern aristocracy.

20:51.247 --> 20:54.247
- What does that mean?
- Mm...

20:55.165 --> 20:57.082
Because I have this great house.

20:57.206 --> 21:00.873
It's your parents' house,
which they let you use, occasionally.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.165
You didn't earn it, so don't act like
you're entitled to it.

21:03.289 --> 21:05.748
- Why are you being so confrontational?
- I'm just being realistic.

21:05.873 --> 21:08.373
I'm serious. I just want to have a nice time
and relax.

21:08.498 --> 21:11.748
As opposed to what?
Relaxing every other day of your life?

21:11.873 --> 21:13.539
I don't relax every day.

21:13.665 --> 21:16.082
I'm sorry. You have one bad thing happen
to you, like, three months ago.

21:16.206 --> 21:20.082
Don't pretend that this is some break
from a tedious and stressful existence.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.873
OK, you know what?

21:21.998 --> 21:23.331
Don't worry about me.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.040
- I'm not.
- Don't think about me. Forget it. Please.

21:33.289 --> 21:34.665
Cat, come on...

21:35.915 --> 21:38.665
Oh, look who has something to say.
Now you want to get involved?

21:40.748 --> 21:43.623
- We're tired.
- "We" are not tired. Don't say "we".

21:43.748 --> 21:46.790
I'm not tired. Just because you're tired,
doesn't mean that I'm tired.

21:46.915 --> 21:50.373
- That's the spirit.
- Well, I'm... pretty tired.

21:50.498 --> 21:52.998
- So...
- Rich is tired.

21:53.123 --> 21:55.289
Yeah, Rich is tired.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.373
- I wanna go.
- Don't go, Rich.

21:57.498 --> 21:59.748
Yeah, don't go, Rich.

21:59.873 --> 22:02.623
- I should get going. I'll see you.
- It's great to meet you, Rich.

22:02.748 --> 22:04.748
Nice to meet you too.

22:08.956 --> 22:11.581
Nice to meet you, K. Take it easy.

22:14.706 --> 22:16.748
I'm sorry about that. I thought
they were gonna be gone all night.

22:16.873 --> 22:19.414
- That's fine. I'm interested.
- How so?

22:19.539 --> 22:22.456
Uh... to meet her.

22:22.581 --> 22:25.456
After hearing you talk about her.

22:25.581 --> 22:27.957
Do you think I'm a horrible friend?

22:28.581 --> 22:31.581
Ah... I don't know
that I can really answer that.

22:31.706 --> 22:33.539
You're always very sweet to me.

22:34.456 --> 22:36.748
Well, you ask so little of me.

22:38.331 --> 22:39.998
Uh...

22:40.122 --> 22:42.539
Sure you don't want to come in?

22:42.664 --> 22:43.873
I should get back.

22:46.081 --> 22:47.956
All right, well...

22:48.081 --> 22:50.081
door's always open.

22:56.372 --> 22:58.831
- Just leave them.
- I don't wanna leave them!

22:58.956 --> 22:59.915
Why?

23:00.040 --> 23:02.289
Because no one else
is gonna clean this up but me.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.831
Will you leave me alone?

24:12.456 --> 24:15.289
It was autumn, October,

24:15.414 --> 24:18.414
and we would just take long walks and...

24:18.539 --> 24:22.956
get takeout
and watch videos at my apartment.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.372
I had that...

24:24.498 --> 24:27.539
basement apartment, at the time, so once
you were inside, no light could get in.

24:27.664 --> 24:31.372
So you could just... never even see
when the sun came up.

24:31.498 --> 24:34.498
I loved that apartment.

24:34.623 --> 24:35.873
But then, after...

24:35.997 --> 24:37.997
a few...

24:38.122 --> 24:41.664
six weeks, him and his girlfriend
started to get back together, and...

24:41.789 --> 24:43.539
he just shut me out.

24:43.664 --> 24:46.997
We had class together,
so we were polite, but...

24:47.122 --> 24:50.206
you know, it was really shitty.

24:50.331 --> 24:53.748
It really broke my heart,
'cause it felt like he didn't...

24:53.873 --> 24:56.206
choose me, you know?

24:56.331 --> 24:58.831
Um... so, then, a couple years go by,

24:58.955 --> 25:02.039
maybe longer, maybe it was more like
two and a half, and...

25:02.164 --> 25:04.456
All of a sudden, out of the blue,
I get this letter.

25:04.581 --> 25:07.706
Like, an actual letter, written on paper.

25:07.831 --> 25:09.414
With a pen...

25:09.539 --> 25:11.247
and it was so sweet and...

25:11.372 --> 25:13.331
It was sort of apologetic, but...

25:13.456 --> 25:16.873
not overtly, or in an annoying way.

25:16.997 --> 25:19.539
Anyways, I agreed to meet him, after work.

25:19.664 --> 25:22.539
Late one night. It was December.

25:22.664 --> 25:25.914
It was, like, 20 degrees out, and...

25:26.039 --> 25:28.039
I was standing outside.
I had that white knit cap on

25:28.164 --> 25:30.414
that I used to wear all the time.

25:30.539 --> 25:32.748
And he came out and he just looked...

25:32.873 --> 25:35.456
exactly the same, and...

25:35.581 --> 25:37.623
He said that I looked the same too,
but that can't be true

25:37.748 --> 25:41.206
because I had really short blond hair,
at the time.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.539
And, um...

25:42.664 --> 25:43.914
We went to a bar

25:44.039 --> 25:46.372
and we had a few drinks
and he told me about how...

25:46.497 --> 25:49.914
Of course, his relationship
inevitably ended, as...

25:50.039 --> 25:52.514
it was meant to, and...

25:52.938 --> 25:56.331
And he just couldn't stop
thinking about me, and...

25:56.456 --> 25:59.789
Before I even knew it,
I was forgiving him.

25:59.914 --> 26:03.664
For... two years of resentment.

26:03.789 --> 26:07.372
For not choosing me, I was forgiving him.

26:08.539 --> 26:10.164
And...

26:10.289 --> 26:12.414
his apartment was nearby, so...

26:12.539 --> 26:14.289
we were walking there and I...

26:14.414 --> 26:15.748
asked if I could use the bathroom,

26:15.872 --> 26:18.372
which I know sounds like
a really cheap move,

26:18.497 --> 26:21.331
but I really did have to go, and...

26:21.456 --> 26:24.539
I really did think I was just gonna
go in there and then leave, and...

26:24.664 --> 26:27.789
But then it was really warm inside
and so cold outside,

26:27.914 --> 26:29.414
and so we just, like...

26:29.539 --> 26:31.581
ended up talking, and...

26:31.706 --> 26:34.623
and then kissing, and, you know...

26:34.748 --> 26:38.664
We just fell asleep for a while, and...

26:38.789 --> 26:41.955
So, we were together, then,
through the holidays, and...

26:42.080 --> 26:45.247
he came to my house
and I met his parents, and...

26:45.372 --> 26:47.164
it was going really well, and...

26:47.289 --> 26:51.789
It just felt like we were finally getting
what we didn't get in the first place.

26:51.913 --> 26:53.289
You know? And...

26:53.414 --> 26:55.955
Something that was so real and...

26:56.080 --> 26:58.080
It felt so important.

26:59.872 --> 27:02.205
Then a few more months passed and...

27:02.331 --> 27:05.997
Um... he started to get distant again, and...

27:06.122 --> 27:08.289
I was planning weekend trips and...

27:08.414 --> 27:12.789
introducing him to my friends and just trying
to really integrate him into my life.

27:12.913 --> 27:15.456
Then I realised... you know,
two or three days were passing,

27:15.581 --> 27:17.581
where I wasn't hearing from him.

27:17.706 --> 27:20.997
And it hit me that he was...
doing it again.

27:21.122 --> 27:23.872
He was just...
He was doing the exact same thing

27:23.997 --> 27:26.706
that he did before, and...

27:27.630 --> 27:32.205
And I was too stupid to realise it,
before it was too late.

27:32.331 --> 27:34.623
And I knew that my problem...
this problem that I have,

27:34.748 --> 27:38.622
this issue that just keeps
landing me in the same place...

27:38.748 --> 27:41.205
Almost three years later, here I was,
in the exact same place.

27:41.331 --> 27:43.830
Was because I was...

27:43.955 --> 27:46.497
more impressed with this note,
with this handwritten note,

27:46.622 --> 27:51.289
than I was with his...
supposed changes in personality.

27:51.414 --> 27:53.622
You know? I saw this...

27:53.748 --> 27:56.121
this effort, this...

27:57.331 --> 28:01.913
This textile representation of his feelings,
and I...

28:02.039 --> 28:03.706
I thought it was something real
when it wasn't.

28:03.830 --> 28:08.331
It was just trite and clichÃ©d and fatuous.

28:08.456 --> 28:12.955
But, I mean, it was real.
It was this real piece of paper...

28:13.080 --> 28:16.622
which, I'm ashamed to admit,
I carried around, like, three apartments,

28:16.747 --> 28:18.205
after that.

28:18.331 --> 28:20.331
But it wasn't real, it...

28:22.080 --> 28:25.080
it just was something
that was completely empty.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
And hollow.

28:30.122 --> 28:35.581
And it just made me realise that I'm just in
this self-perpetuating cycle of defeat,

28:35.706 --> 28:38.706
where I can't get out of it,
because I can't get out of it,

28:38.830 --> 28:41.597
because I can't get out of it...

28:42.221 --> 28:43.372
I need some time...

28:43.497 --> 28:45.372
It's one of the worst tendencies
of human nature,

28:45.497 --> 28:48.497
to assume the best of others.

28:49.372 --> 28:52.205
You remember Chad?

28:54.330 --> 28:56.414
- So, we were friends, right?
- Mm.

28:56.539 --> 29:00.122
Whatever that means in middle school,
and...

29:00.247 --> 29:02.247
He was my first kiss.

29:03.456 --> 29:08.039
Over the years,
we were in the same friend group, and...

29:08.164 --> 29:09.830
I don't think he ever...

29:09.955 --> 29:13.164
knew he was my first kiss, anyway.
We never talked about it.

29:14.539 --> 29:16.955
But I'd say...

29:17.830 --> 29:21.747
throughout high school, graduation,
college, he was like...

29:21.872 --> 29:24.872
top-20, all-time good friends.

29:26.456 --> 29:28.372
And, then, after college,
for whatever reason,

29:28.497 --> 29:30.913
we started seeing a lot of one another.

29:31.747 --> 29:35.372
And... we'd hang out, like,
a couple times a week.

29:36.539 --> 29:38.872
Go to concerts, have dinner.

29:38.997 --> 29:41.997
And, then, we were
just... suddenly... together,

29:42.122 --> 29:44.581
hooking up and...
spending the night at his place

29:44.705 --> 29:46.705
and mine, you know...

29:48.705 --> 29:50.913
And it was summer.

29:51.038 --> 29:52.497
It was great.

29:52.622 --> 29:56.247
It was absolutely
one of those summer things, where...

29:56.372 --> 29:58.830
All my memories of that time are...

29:58.955 --> 30:02.581
intricately connected to him.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.872
But he was going to grad school,
or law school or something...

30:07.997 --> 30:13.830
So, around July, I start telling him,
you know, this is going where it's going.

30:14.455 --> 30:16.913
It's not going to grad school
with him, and...

30:17.038 --> 30:20.830
He says he gets it, but then,
things start to get more serious,

30:20.955 --> 30:22.663
and it becomes clear to me that

30:22.788 --> 30:26.289
he hasn't been in a serious relationship
in a long time.

30:26.414 --> 30:29.788
So, I keep reminding him that...

30:29.913 --> 30:32.289
we're headed for a dead end,

30:32.414 --> 30:37.539
and he says,
"Yeah, I get it. It's fine. I get it."

30:37.663 --> 30:39.621
And I believe him.

30:39.746 --> 30:41.581
And then, suddenly, it's August,

30:41.705 --> 30:45.372
and before he's even gone, he's already...

30:45.497 --> 30:48.539
talking about me coming to visit him
and a trip he has planned

30:48.663 --> 30:51.038
to come back and...

30:51.164 --> 30:52.913
in October...

30:53.038 --> 30:54.663
So...

30:56.205 --> 30:58.872
I say no.

30:58.997 --> 31:00.705
That's not gonna happen.
None of that is real.

31:00.830 --> 31:03.830
And he thinks I'm joking.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.455
He basically ignores it all.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.705
So, then he's gone, and within...

31:08.830 --> 31:11.414
a week or two,
I'm seeing somebody else, and...

31:11.539 --> 31:14.038
he's still calling, all the time, and...

31:14.164 --> 31:17.247
one night, some Saturday night, I'm...

31:17.372 --> 31:19.247
out in a bar and...

31:19.372 --> 31:21.621
he calls and he's giving me the business
about being out

31:21.746 --> 31:26.080
at two or three in the morning, and I just
snapped and was screaming at him.

31:26.205 --> 31:29.330
Telling him he was a delusional bastard,
and I can't believe what I'm hearing,

31:29.455 --> 31:31.913
and I want to have nothing to do with him.

31:32.038 --> 31:35.997
So, that's that.
It's September now, and...

31:36.122 --> 31:39.372
I don't hear from him or anything,
until Christmas, when he's back...

31:39.497 --> 31:41.497
around, obviously.

31:42.497 --> 31:44.997
And, so, we're all at a bar.

31:45.122 --> 31:47.289
I don't know where you were
during all of this.

31:47.414 --> 31:50.080
Maybe you were away that year,
for whatever reason.

31:50.205 --> 31:53.289
Anyway, we see each other, and...

31:54.872 --> 31:57.663
It's as if nothing has ever happened.

31:57.788 --> 32:01.414
He's civil, but I can tell he's seething,
and just seeing him pisses me off so much,

32:01.538 --> 32:03.163
because I can see now what he is.

32:03.289 --> 32:09.289
Just this... delusional, desperate man,
and goddamn, that is so unattractive.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.580
So, my point is...

32:15.289 --> 32:19.122
You can get out someone else's cycle,
but you can't get out of your own.

32:19.247 --> 32:21.580
You were victimised
by his handwritten note

32:21.705 --> 32:26.496
and I was... victimised
by his inability to face reality.

32:26.621 --> 32:28.621
And yet...

32:29.705 --> 32:32.372
here we both are.

32:32.496 --> 32:34.496
Where the fuck are they?

32:54.746 --> 32:56.247
Who the hell are you?

32:56.372 --> 32:58.788
Me? Rich.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.247
From last year.

33:04.913 --> 33:08.247
- Sorry, I'm not good with faces or names.
- So...

33:08.372 --> 33:10.746
you mean, like, people?

33:10.871 --> 33:12.372
Yeah, them too.

33:12.496 --> 33:14.496
Heard about your dad.

33:15.788 --> 33:18.788
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't be. You didn't know him.

33:19.496 --> 33:21.122
Still...

33:22.871 --> 33:25.621
- Why are you here?
- Well, I had to say "hey" to my girls.

33:25.746 --> 33:27.997
I'm sure you can't be referring to me
when you say that.

33:28.122 --> 33:29.913
Just wanted to see what was up.

33:30.038 --> 33:33.538
- I saw Ginny's car outside.
- Don't call her Ginny.

33:39.621 --> 33:42.330
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

33:49.247 --> 33:52.289
Why is that guy here?

33:52.413 --> 33:53.663
Who, Rich?

33:54.663 --> 33:56.663
Yeah. "Rich".

33:59.621 --> 34:02.538
He likes to hang out, sometimes.

34:02.663 --> 34:04.247
I don't know. Who cares?

34:07.454 --> 34:10.080
What are you up to, next week?

34:10.504 --> 34:12.246
I haven't a clue.

34:12.371 --> 34:15.246
That must be nice.

34:15.371 --> 34:16.996
What?

34:18.496 --> 34:21.080
To choose to just...

34:21.205 --> 34:23.205
hang out and do nothing.

34:24.454 --> 34:28.496
I didn't choose to be here. Nobody would
choose to be in this situation.

34:28.621 --> 34:32.038
I was thrust into this situation,
against my will.

34:38.121 --> 34:40.538
Yeah, I know how that feels...

34:52.996 --> 34:55.163
Because it can't possibly be
that complicated.

34:57.997 --> 35:00.496
Just tell him everything is fine.
I left everything in order.

35:03.579 --> 35:06.122
Yes, I told him it would be there
by the end of the month.

35:06.247 --> 35:08.413
I just told him that
there were extraordinary circumstances.

35:08.538 --> 35:12.788
I didn't feel the need to explain it.
It's a family matter.

35:12.913 --> 35:15.538
It's absolutely none of their business.

35:16.871 --> 35:19.496
Tell them what it is. It's nobody's business.

35:23.080 --> 35:24.663
Well, you're gonna have to say it
in the way that I'm saying it.

35:24.788 --> 35:27.038
You have to speak to him in a certain way,
with a certain tone.

35:27.163 --> 35:29.288
Otherwise, he won't listen.

36:10.663 --> 36:12.955
...then, the newcomer,
who's all freaked out,

36:13.080 --> 36:16.080
she has to cut the baby out of me.

36:17.579 --> 36:20.496
And then my water broke. It was, um...

36:20.621 --> 36:22.413
You know, I had to see it,
before I felt it,

36:22.538 --> 36:24.329
because I couldn't feel between my legs.

36:24.454 --> 36:26.913
But the water was ice cold, so, you know,

36:27.038 --> 36:29.996
I sort of tried not to jolt,
and then it would come out and then...

36:30.122 --> 36:31.538
I turned to her and I was, like,

36:31.663 --> 36:33.579
"They baby's coming.
You have to cut it out of me."

36:33.704 --> 36:35.621
- And I had rotted-out teeth.
- Really?

36:35.746 --> 36:38.788
It was... A real winner.

36:38.913 --> 36:41.038
I just wanted to finally...

36:41.163 --> 36:45.163
purge all of that from my life.

36:45.287 --> 36:47.746
I'd already cut out so many
worthless and negative people

36:47.871 --> 36:51.246
who brought me nothing but annoyance
or distraction, so...

36:51.371 --> 36:53.038
I figured, why should she be any different?

36:53.163 --> 36:55.371
Because family is different.

36:55.496 --> 36:57.038
No, they aren't.

36:57.163 --> 36:58.788
Nobody gets a free pass.

36:58.913 --> 37:01.746
- That's a horrible thing to say.
- It's horrible to feel.

37:01.871 --> 37:03.538
I wish I didn't feel it.

37:03.663 --> 37:06.038
I wish I could have relationships
with some people I can't.

37:06.163 --> 37:08.329
But once they become just cyphers,

37:08.454 --> 37:10.122
or...

37:10.246 --> 37:13.871
you know, energy drains
or, or they become...

37:13.996 --> 37:16.204
Someone who distracts or depresses me,

37:16.329 --> 37:19.287
I have to have nothing to do with them.
I can't help it.

37:19.412 --> 37:20.663
You can help it.

37:20.788 --> 37:23.454
No, I can't. I've tried. I just...

37:23.579 --> 37:25.412
hate them, and I hate being around them.

37:25.538 --> 37:27.538
And I hate talking to them, and...

37:28.746 --> 37:34.746
I love eliminating those enemies
from every aspect of my life.

37:36.412 --> 37:39.788
I don't think I've ever heard an adult
use the word 'enemy'.

37:39.913 --> 37:42.913
Oh, don't be naive. It's the only word.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.038
I don't know...

37:47.163 --> 37:49.704
I think I'm taking the high road.

37:51.788 --> 37:53.412
I do!

37:53.538 --> 37:55.538
That's just not very adult.

37:56.246 --> 37:58.412
Well, you made the cut. I love you.

37:58.538 --> 38:00.538
Let's celebrate that.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.579
Lucky me...

38:06.080 --> 38:09.496
- Yeah, watch your step.
- I don't want to be an enemy...

38:44.287 --> 38:46.871
I made a salad for you.

38:46.996 --> 38:49.829
It's good. You should eat it.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.913
Thank you.

38:58.204 --> 39:02.038
Sorry, I kind of, uh... spread out.

41:07.579 --> 41:09.537
It was our only collaboration.

41:09.663 --> 41:12.412
We wanted to do something together.

41:12.537 --> 41:15.329
It was a beautiful portrait.

41:15.454 --> 41:19.245
It just turned into
something else completely.

41:19.371 --> 41:22.579
- Yeah.
- It became the image of his death.

41:22.704 --> 41:26.204
So, I didn't want
anything to do with it anymore.

41:26.329 --> 41:28.788
It was a morbid image.

41:28.913 --> 41:31.913
We thought it was really funny.

41:33.953 --> 41:35.704
Did you like working with him?

41:35.829 --> 41:38.496
Yeah, he was a genius.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.537
Is that a yes?

41:40.663 --> 41:42.663
Well, he taught me everything.

41:46.162 --> 41:49.953
And I know that everyone said that
everything I got was from nepotism,

41:50.079 --> 41:53.913
but I didn't really care. I don't care.

41:54.037 --> 41:56.953
I just thought he was not only my father,

41:57.079 --> 41:59.913
but I admired him for being
a great artist.

42:03.496 --> 42:05.537
ClichÃ©d, tortured...

42:05.662 --> 42:07.646
suicidal...

42:12.662 --> 42:15.662
I think Rich is coming by later.

42:19.329 --> 42:21.329
What?

42:22.912 --> 42:24.746
I, literally, didn't say anything.

42:25.621 --> 42:27.912
Exactly...

42:28.037 --> 42:30.412
Does he have to come by?

42:30.537 --> 42:34.162
- What's the problem?
- I need you to... stay still.

42:35.829 --> 42:38.746
I just thought
we were going to be alone together.

42:38.871 --> 42:40.788
Yeah, that's what I thought last summer.

42:40.912 --> 42:42.537
OK.

42:42.662 --> 42:44.579
I... I love Rich.

42:44.704 --> 42:47.329
- He's fascinating.
- C'mon.

42:47.454 --> 42:50.662
Well... I just don't think
he's good enough for you. So...

42:50.788 --> 42:52.621
I think he's just like everybody else.

42:54.204 --> 42:55.621
How do you mean?

42:55.746 --> 42:58.579
Just prying into people's business...

42:59.412 --> 43:01.746
You know, last year he didn't ask me
two questions about myself

43:01.870 --> 43:04.912
and now he just wants to know everything.

43:05.037 --> 43:06.788
I wonder why. That's all.

43:06.912 --> 43:09.412
- He just knows you better.
- He doesn't know me at all.

43:09.537 --> 43:13.037
- He's curious.
- Well, curiosity killed my father.

43:13.162 --> 43:15.412
Depression killed your father.

43:17.412 --> 43:20.329
I'm sorry, I really can't do this,
if you're not gonna sit still.

43:58.245 --> 44:01.037
Frank and Sylvie's house?

44:01.162 --> 44:03.454
- I'm their niece's guest.
- Virginia?

44:03.579 --> 44:05.329
Yeah.

44:05.454 --> 44:06.788
Been here before?

44:06.912 --> 44:08.788
Just once, last year.

44:08.912 --> 44:10.787
They're terrible people.

44:12.204 --> 44:14.454
Well, they're not here right now.

44:14.579 --> 44:16.579
I know.

44:16.704 --> 44:19.329
That kind of money
rubs people the wrong way.

44:20.746 --> 44:22.746
When were you here last?

44:22.870 --> 44:25.120
About the same time last year.

44:25.245 --> 44:28.037
Nice season, last year.

44:28.162 --> 44:30.786
Yes. Seemed OK.

44:30.912 --> 44:33.537
You be careful now. You never know.

44:35.037 --> 44:36.828
Never know what?

44:36.953 --> 44:38.329
Exactly.

48:58.578 --> 49:00.412
- Hey...
- Why are you in the bushes?

49:00.536 --> 49:01.786
Where am I?

49:06.037 --> 49:08.661
- I'm suck.
- I think you mean you're sick.

49:08.786 --> 49:10.786
Mm-hm...

49:11.412 --> 49:13.287
Come on.

49:13.412 --> 49:15.037
Oh, hold on...

49:25.328 --> 49:28.328
- Here's your hot water.
- Thanks.

49:34.494 --> 49:37.036
Nice place.

49:37.162 --> 49:38.828
Thanks. It's not mine.

49:38.953 --> 49:41.661
- I think I came to a party here, once.
- Oh.

49:41.786 --> 49:44.745
Did you throw that...
that "Dressed to Get Sexed" party

49:44.870 --> 49:46.927
on Labor Day, last year?

49:47.253 --> 49:51.120
How many times do I have to
fucking tell you this is not my house?

49:51.245 --> 49:53.036
But I've seen you here, though, right?

49:53.162 --> 49:55.036
Maybe. I was here last year.

49:55.162 --> 49:57.203
I knew it.

49:57.328 --> 50:00.870
I thought you said
you'd never been here before.

50:00.995 --> 50:04.828
No, now I think about it,
that party was at some other place.

50:09.703 --> 50:13.120
- You want to go for a walk?
- No.

50:14.328 --> 50:16.536
Why not?

50:25.162 --> 50:28.162
I could murder you right now
and no one would ever know.

50:35.494 --> 50:37.120
Hm...?

51:32.619 --> 51:35.411
What, do you live here now?

51:35.536 --> 51:38.328
I heard you walking around
super-late last night.

51:38.452 --> 51:41.494
It sounded like you were...
talking to yourself.

51:41.619 --> 51:45.911
Yeah, I was... I was talking to myself.
Why would I be doing that?

51:46.036 --> 51:47.870
- Can you please get out of my way?
- Yeah, here!

51:47.995 --> 51:50.494
No, I'm good. I'm just going to get my own.

51:50.619 --> 51:51.995
What the fuck... What are you doing?

51:52.120 --> 51:54.287
I don't understand why you're here.
You don't live here.

51:54.411 --> 51:55.411
What's your problem?

51:55.536 --> 51:58.369
My problem is that I'm trying to have
a nice time with my best friend,

51:58.494 --> 52:01.494
and you're just... here all the fucking time.

52:03.870 --> 52:07.078
- Ginny invited me here, you know.
- Don't call her Ginny.

52:09.953 --> 52:13.245
- Take it.
- I don't want it.

52:13.369 --> 52:17.619
- I made you a cup of coffee.
- No, I don't want it.

52:17.744 --> 52:21.369
Are you... fucking serious?

52:22.194 --> 52:24.494
Jesus fucking Christ...

52:25.995 --> 52:28.578
You're a real fucking spoilt bitch,
you know that?

52:28.703 --> 52:30.870
You ain't shit, just 'cause of
who your father was.

52:49.786 --> 52:52.786
How much of that did you see?

53:07.578 --> 53:09.995
Oh, well...

53:32.369 --> 53:35.619
- What?
- Nothing. I was just thinking.

53:37.286 --> 53:39.286
About what?

53:40.828 --> 53:43.452
Just about us.

54:04.411 --> 54:06.411
I feel sick.

54:10.369 --> 54:12.369
I feel messed up.

54:15.369 --> 54:17.369
I'm sorry.

54:18.536 --> 54:21.536
My face hurts. All the time.

54:22.244 --> 54:23.911
Like a headache?

54:24.036 --> 54:26.786
No, it's like...

54:26.911 --> 54:31.120
the bones are grinding, beneath my skin.

54:32.411 --> 54:34.995
I don't think that's a thing.

54:38.828 --> 54:41.828
It just makes it really hard to concentrate.

54:46.036 --> 54:48.869
You haven't been sleeping. Have you?

54:52.452 --> 54:55.244
I could do without the attitude...

54:56.828 --> 55:00.828
The whole "Catherine is crazy" attitude.

55:00.953 --> 55:02.953
I didn't say you were crazy.

55:05.369 --> 55:07.369
You thought it.

55:09.120 --> 55:11.120
Don't tell me what I think.

55:20.285 --> 55:22.869
It's just... I know that...

55:22.995 --> 55:27.995
you bring Rich round
so that you can talk to him about me.

55:29.577 --> 55:31.577
Not everything is about you.

55:34.327 --> 55:36.327
I know.

55:41.577 --> 55:44.577
It's fascinating...

55:45.160 --> 55:47.744
I feel like I'm...

55:47.869 --> 55:49.911
seeing you for the first time.

55:52.411 --> 55:54.619
What do you mean?

55:54.744 --> 55:56.744
I always thought you were so perfect.

56:00.869 --> 56:03.869
I thought you had it all figured out.

56:06.369 --> 56:08.869
But you were just
surrounding yourself with men.

56:10.953 --> 56:13.160
With James, with your father...

56:15.285 --> 56:17.577
They took care of you.

56:22.911 --> 56:25.119
Without them...

56:28.536 --> 56:31.077
here you are.

56:31.202 --> 56:33.036
Hm...

56:34.619 --> 56:37.828
I think the best hope for me now is...

56:37.953 --> 56:41.077
to not end up like my father.

56:42.953 --> 56:45.160
How's that going?

56:46.702 --> 56:48.702
Mm...

56:50.953 --> 56:52.953
Touch and go.

57:00.119 --> 57:03.953
I just don't really feel
like I exist anymore.

57:06.786 --> 57:10.661
And the only two people
that really cared about me

57:10.786 --> 57:13.410
abandoned me.

57:16.619 --> 57:19.619
- In one form or another.
- I care about you.

57:24.202 --> 57:26.202
No, you don't.

57:33.828 --> 57:38.452
You have to hold very still
because I have to do the features now.

58:15.536 --> 58:19.285
Dudes. Question.

58:19.410 --> 58:21.035
You drive a car...

58:21.160 --> 58:22.952
fly a plane...

58:23.077 --> 58:24.828
ride a bike...

58:24.952 --> 58:26.828
What's the analogy for a boat?

58:26.952 --> 58:29.285
- You drive it, as well.
- I don't know, Catherine.

58:31.369 --> 58:33.244
Can you drive a canoe?

58:34.077 --> 58:37.536
- Can you steer a boat?
- Can you steer a canoe?

58:37.661 --> 58:38.828
Enough with the canoe.

58:38.952 --> 58:42.160
Can't you find a counterpoint
besides a goddamned canoe?

58:43.285 --> 58:46.702
It's a valid question,
is all's I'm saying, K.

58:49.910 --> 58:53.910
Make sure you put that on. I don't
want you falling in and drowning. Or...

58:54.035 --> 58:58.035
something horrible like that.

59:04.786 --> 59:07.744
- Ready?
- Hold on. I'm not buttoned yet.

59:07.869 --> 59:10.993
- Ready, I guess...
- No, I'm not snapped in.

59:11.118 --> 59:13.118
Ready.

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.661
Hey, K.

01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:11.868
K...

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:14.202
Hey, K.

01:00:14.327 --> 01:00:17.285
My name starts with a C.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.786
- Are you for real?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:21.285
I've been calling you K for a whole year.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.285
That's awesome.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.410
It's not that awesome.

01:00:26.535 --> 01:00:27.910
Well, thanks for coming out
on the lake today.

01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:29.786
Thank you very much for inviting me.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:31.369
OK.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.243
You know, I figured you'd probably just
want to be some place where...

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:37.077
people weren't talking to you about...

01:00:37.202 --> 01:00:39.202
how you're doing, and all that stuff.

01:00:40.535 --> 01:00:42.535
And look what you're doing now...

01:00:44.868 --> 01:00:46.868
You don't know what I'm doing.

01:00:48.535 --> 01:00:51.535
You're a real mystery, Rich.

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:41.285
Face thing?

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:43.035
Yes.

01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:48.202
Hurts to talk.

01:01:48.327 --> 01:01:51.369
All of a sudden?

01:01:52.452 --> 01:01:53.910
It comes and goes.

01:01:54.035 --> 01:01:56.118
You realise how fake this sounds?

01:01:56.243 --> 01:01:59.243
Do you realise how insulting that is?

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.202
Just trying to understand.

01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:06.785
No. You're trying to judge.

01:02:20.285 --> 01:02:22.701
I don't feel like myself.

01:02:24.202 --> 01:02:26.619
She's good, but... you know...

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.951
She has this guy hanging around
and he's super-creepy.

01:02:33.452 --> 01:02:34.910
I just get a bad feeling.

01:02:40.077 --> 01:02:42.285
'I don't feel safe.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:45.743
'Yeah, well they took me out
on a boat, today,

01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:48.910
'which was really weird.

01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:52.035
'It was just dumb...'

01:02:54.077 --> 01:02:56.077
And I miss you too.

01:02:58.285 --> 01:03:01.285
Yeah?

01:03:03.785 --> 01:03:05.785
I'm sorry, can I call you back?

01:03:07.035 --> 01:03:08.659
OK.

01:03:12.452 --> 01:03:14.452
OK, fine.

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:19.910
Who were you talking to?

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.327
It's none of your business.

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:29.452
I'm just... curious.

01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:33.243
Well, I'm serious.
It's none of your business.

01:03:33.368 --> 01:03:36.619
- Was that James?
- No.

01:03:38.577 --> 01:03:41.327
Catherine...

01:03:43.618 --> 01:03:45.618
I know.

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.910
Hey, do you stay around here?

01:04:18.035 --> 01:04:20.202
- Um... I'm a guest.
- Where?

01:04:20.327 --> 01:04:21.868
- Here.
- Here where, though?

01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:24.410
Here, in this house.
What do you think I mean?

01:04:24.535 --> 01:04:25.910
Wait, wait. I recognise you.

01:04:26.035 --> 01:04:28.202
I'm sorry. From TV.

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:31.076
I remember. Yeah. It was your dad
that tried to rip off all those people.

01:04:31.202 --> 01:04:32.243
That's not how it happened.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:35.993
No, but then you had people thinking
you knew where the money was.

01:04:36.118 --> 01:04:39.268
No, that's not what happened.
You obviously don't know me.

01:04:46.576 --> 01:04:49.576
So, have you known Frank and Sylvie long?

01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:53.368
I've known them for...
Oh, God. Since I was a kid.

01:04:53.494 --> 01:04:55.659
Yeah.

01:04:55.784 --> 01:04:58.701
It's 20 years. No, like... 18 years.

01:04:58.826 --> 01:05:02.327
You would never believe anything
that anyone said about him.

01:05:02.452 --> 01:05:04.534
Even after people came forward
and testified,

01:05:04.659 --> 01:05:07.243
I was always, like, "No. Absolutely not."

01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:10.076
Nothing weird. Nothing strange.

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:11.659
Are you OK?

01:05:11.784 --> 01:05:14.534
Oh, my, Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:16.659
You all right?

01:05:22.951 --> 01:05:24.618
Catherine.

01:05:24.743 --> 01:05:26.701
This is Warlock.

01:05:26.826 --> 01:05:28.410
And Dragon.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.701
No! No! No!

01:05:59.118 --> 01:06:02.118
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:13.834
Well, that's not how
I was taught to leave a party.

01:07:31.909 --> 01:07:33.868
- ...to express my opinions.
- Of course you are.

01:07:33.993 --> 01:07:35.327
But could you also take it down a notch?

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:38.243
Oh, I hate it when you say that!

01:07:41.243 --> 01:07:43.243
So, what's on the agenda for today?

01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:46.243
A walk?

01:07:46.368 --> 01:07:49.367
I was thinking a swim.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.160
- You wanna go for a swim, sweetheart?
- What?

01:07:53.285 --> 01:07:55.285
Swim?

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:57.409
You wanna go for a swim?

01:07:57.534 --> 01:07:58.784
Swim?

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:02.534
Oh, I don't know... Maybe another time.

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:05.909
Take your time.

01:08:06.035 --> 01:08:08.035
My time...

01:08:09.035 --> 01:08:11.409
I'll take my time.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:27.325
I didn't expect anybody to be up.

01:09:27.451 --> 01:09:29.451
Yeah, me neither.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.533
I just wanted to tell you that I wasn't
interested in you

01:09:34.658 --> 01:09:36.993
or anything about you, last night.

01:09:37.118 --> 01:09:39.243
- OK...
- I don't even really know these people.

01:09:39.367 --> 01:09:42.367
My friends are renting a house nearby.

01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:45.201
I don't really know them either.

01:09:45.908 --> 01:09:46.993
How'd you end up here?

01:09:47.118 --> 01:09:48.826
Oh, I guess... um...

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:51.576
Well, I'm friends with the niece.

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.076
Small world.

01:09:56.201 --> 01:09:57.617
Increasingly...

01:09:58.784 --> 01:10:01.284
So, your father was friends
with Ginny's father?

01:10:01.409 --> 01:10:03.576
I thought you didn't want to ask.

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:07.576
- I'm just talking here.
- Are we?

01:13:02.409 --> 01:13:04.284
What the fuck...?

01:13:04.409 --> 01:13:07.034
Catherine... shit...

01:13:08.034 --> 01:13:11.091
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:13:38.867 --> 01:13:42.367
- Is your face OK?
- Mm. Fine.

01:13:44.075 --> 01:13:47.075
- Is it acting up again?
- Mm-mm.

01:13:50.033 --> 01:13:52.742
Does... drinking make it better or worse?

01:13:52.867 --> 01:13:54.867
- Better... usually.
- Hm...

01:13:54.993 --> 01:13:57.617
Have you seen a doctor?

01:13:57.742 --> 01:14:00.117
Mm-hm. I've seen a bunch of them.

01:14:00.242 --> 01:14:03.033
I've seen dermatologists,
I've seen a dentist,

01:14:03.158 --> 01:14:06.575
and I've seen an ENT.

01:14:06.701 --> 01:14:09.951
I've had X-rays and MRIs.

01:14:10.075 --> 01:14:12.284
And?

01:14:12.409 --> 01:14:14.409
Nothing.

01:14:16.951 --> 01:14:19.200
Sounds psychosomatic to me.

01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:23.784
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying, like...

01:14:23.909 --> 01:14:25.826
half a dozen doctors tell you that...

01:14:25.951 --> 01:14:27.909
A dozen, at least.

01:14:28.033 --> 01:14:31.909
If a fuckload of doctors tells you that
there's nothing wrong with you,

01:14:32.033 --> 01:14:35.158
then what other conclusion
can you possibly reach.

01:14:35.284 --> 01:14:36.951
I don't know, Rich.

01:14:37.617 --> 01:14:39.886
Maybe that they're wrong.

01:14:42.909 --> 01:14:44.909
You know more than the doctors.

01:14:53.075 --> 01:14:56.075
- How's Virginia's portrait coming along?
- Rich, cut it out.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.867
What? I'm curious.

01:14:58.992 --> 01:15:01.492
You say you've been working on it.
I can't wait to see it.

01:15:01.617 --> 01:15:03.701
What's your fucking problem?

01:15:03.826 --> 01:15:07.575
Just think of all the press you're gonna get.

01:15:07.701 --> 01:15:11.325
Emerging from tragedy
with such an accomplished canvas.

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:15.742
It's really gonna be quite an event.

01:15:17.784 --> 01:15:19.450
How dare you.

01:15:21.409 --> 01:15:24.826
Who the hell are you to come in
and speak to me that way?

01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:30.701
I don't even know you.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:34.534
How dare you speak to me like that.

01:15:34.659 --> 01:15:37.075
You fucking animal.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.033
You unrepentant piece of shit.

01:15:41.534 --> 01:15:46.534
You click your tongue, and you revel
in the affairs of others.

01:15:48.784 --> 01:15:51.784
You are worthless.

01:15:52.742 --> 01:15:55.575
You don't know anything about me.

01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:58.575
You show up to fuck my best friend.

01:15:58.701 --> 01:16:01.701
And you pry into the lives of others.

01:16:01.826 --> 01:16:07.033
To conceal how worthless and boring
your own life is.

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.659
I don't deserve this.

01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:13.742
I just want to be left alone.

01:16:13.866 --> 01:16:18.242
I want to be left alone with
the few people who are left in this world,

01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:20.367
who are decent.

01:16:24.534 --> 01:16:27.367
You are weak... and greedy.

01:16:27.492 --> 01:16:29.200
And selfish.

01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:33.117
And you are the root of every problem.

01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:35.534
You...

01:16:35.659 --> 01:16:38.200
are why people betray one another.

01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:41.200
You are why there is nowhere safe

01:16:41.325 --> 01:16:44.158
or happy, anymore.

01:16:44.283 --> 01:16:45.450
You...

01:16:45.575 --> 01:16:49.450
are why depression exists.

01:16:49.575 --> 01:16:53.033
You are why there is no escape

01:16:53.158 --> 01:16:56.575
from indecency and gossip.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.700
And lies.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.242
You...

01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:05.283
Rich...

01:17:05.409 --> 01:17:09.825
You are why my father had to die.

01:17:11.742 --> 01:17:15.742
Because he couldn't live
in a world like this.

01:19:34.659 --> 01:19:39.658
I was wondering if, or when,
you'd be back here.

01:19:43.991 --> 01:19:46.783
This was supposed to be my vacation.

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:50.908
Ah... Sorry if I ruined that.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.617
Why don't you like me?

01:20:02.116 --> 01:20:03.950
You know, I mean...

01:20:04.075 --> 01:20:07.075
I mean, really.

01:20:08.866 --> 01:20:11.783
You're a rich, spoiled brat.

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:15.699
You grew up in a bubble,
and when that bubble popped,

01:20:15.824 --> 01:20:18.450
you expected everybody to be around
and feel sorry for you.

01:20:19.242 --> 01:20:21.908
- I thought I just wanted to be left alone.
- No.

01:20:22.033 --> 01:20:23.575
You didn't.

01:20:23.699 --> 01:20:26.616
You wanted to make
a spectacle of yourself.

01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:28.741
- Yeah...?
- Yeah.

01:20:30.575 --> 01:20:34.116
But you don't really know me.

01:20:34.242 --> 01:20:38.033
Don't I?
You were a stuck-up brat last year.

01:20:38.158 --> 01:20:39.824
And...

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:42.908
you're a stuck-up brat this year too.

01:20:43.033 --> 01:20:44.450
So...

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.450
You will never be your father.
You know that?

01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:58.200
You were never going to be.

01:20:58.325 --> 01:21:00.950
In fact, I'm convinced

01:21:01.075 --> 01:21:03.783
that if you weren't related to him,

01:21:03.908 --> 01:21:06.908
you probably wouldn't have gotten
close to him.

01:21:13.033 --> 01:21:15.033
Cat?

01:21:16.866 --> 01:21:18.866
What are you doing?

01:21:21.408 --> 01:21:23.492
Stop. Stop it.

01:21:23.616 --> 01:21:28.616
OK. All right. Cat, stop it.

01:21:30.116 --> 01:21:32.373
What are you doing?

01:21:32.991 --> 01:21:35.824
Rich, I'm sorry.

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:37.991
I'm sorry, Rich.

01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:41.158
Ginny?

01:21:46.283 --> 01:21:48.699
Ginny, I'm sorry.

01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:51.367
I'm sorry.

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.949
Ginny, I'm sorry.

01:21:58.492 --> 01:22:00.241
I'm really sorry.

01:22:00.367 --> 01:22:03.408
Oh, I made a mess.

01:22:03.532 --> 01:22:06.532
Really, I made a mess. I'm sorry.

01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:11.699
I'm sorry. Please...

01:22:11.824 --> 01:22:14.367
Please don't be mad with me.

01:22:14.492 --> 01:22:17.492
Just don't leave me, OK?

01:22:19.574 --> 01:22:21.574
Ginny...

01:22:21.699 --> 01:22:24.367
I promise I'll get better.

01:22:24.491 --> 01:22:26.699
I promise.

01:22:26.824 --> 01:22:28.532
I promise I will.

01:22:30.616 --> 01:22:32.450
You're not gonna leave me...

01:22:35.699 --> 01:22:37.325
Ready to go?

01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:38.657
Not at all...

01:22:38.783 --> 01:22:39.991
wish I never had to...

01:22:45.116 --> 01:22:48.616
I'm glad that I got to... make it up here.

01:22:48.741 --> 01:22:50.699
And I'm sorry if, uh...

01:22:50.824 --> 01:22:52.574
I ruined it by bringing, you know...

01:22:52.699 --> 01:22:56.325
- What's his name?
- Can't remember.

01:22:58.991 --> 01:23:01.824
- Same time next year?
- No question.

01:23:04.866 --> 01:23:07.657
You're gonna be OK.

01:23:09.367 --> 01:23:11.158
Thanks.

01:23:11.283 --> 01:23:13.783
You too.

01:23:13.908 --> 01:23:17.657
I know you've been going through
a hard time, and...

01:23:17.783 --> 01:23:21.783
I just wanted to apologise
if I really wasn't there for you.

01:23:23.325 --> 01:23:24.575
Well...

01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:28.408
Maybe someday you'll be going through
this shit, and I won't be there for you,

01:23:28.532 --> 01:23:29.699
and then we'll be even.

01:23:29.824 --> 01:23:31.449
God, I hope so.

01:23:34.949 --> 01:23:37.075
- No.
- Yes...

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.075
Time has come.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.200
Come here.

01:23:44.158 --> 01:23:47.325
- OK, you gotta let me go now.
- Mm-mm. Not gonna let you go.

01:23:47.449 --> 01:23:50.283
- Gotta do it.
- I don't want to.

01:23:50.407 --> 01:23:52.116
Come on. I feel uncomfortable.

01:23:54.616 --> 01:23:56.325
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:58.449
- See you soon.
- Mm-hm.
