WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.264
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

00:03.307 --> 00:04.700
MR. FREEZE'S
LIQUID NITROGEN CAN

00:04.743 --> 00:05.918
GOT IN THE HANDS OF
A BUNCH OF EIGHTH GRADERS.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.137
I NEED TO FIND IT.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.486
EXPOSURE TO
THE FREEZE SERUM

00:08.530 --> 00:10.053
WILL STOP TIME
AND KEEP YOU FROM AGING.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.185
GONNA NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.665
BATWOMAN.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.232
RYAN, WAKE UP!

00:17.843 --> 00:20.324
NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT
RENEE WAS WILLING

00:20.368 --> 00:22.022
TO CROSS IT OFF HER LIST.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.501
GUESS IT'S SAFE
TO SAY YOU'VE
FIGURED OUT

00:23.545 --> 00:24.763
THE GLITCHES IN
YOUR SUPERSUIT.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.287
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.766
IT'S BECAUSE HE
DISABLED THE FAILSAFE.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.855
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CLEARED
YOU FOR FIELD DUTY.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.727
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO TRY TO HAVE

00:31.770 --> 00:33.424
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY FAMILY,

00:33.468 --> 00:35.861
YOU AND WAYNE ENTERPRISES

00:35.905 --> 00:37.254
WILL COME TO SEVERELY

00:37.298 --> 00:38.734
REGRET THAT DECISION.

00:40.910 --> 00:44.522
DOES THAT HAPPEN A LOT?
THOSE DELUSIONS?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
SO, YOU THINK
YOU KNOW MY STORY.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.135
27. RAISED IN THE SYSTEM.

00:48.178 --> 00:49.353
STINT AT BLACKGATE.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.834
OH, AND YOU'RE MY SISTER.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
AAH!

01:21.907 --> 01:26.129
SUBJECT FXJ-1.
REANIMATION PROGRESS CHECK.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.478
FINAL PHASE.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.351
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

01:50.762 --> 01:54.853
REANIMATION FAILURE.
24 HOURS TILL CLIENT DEADLINE.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.512
WHAT THE HELL?

03:03.531 --> 03:04.706
WHEN DID IT GET HERE?

03:04.749 --> 03:05.750
TRAGICALLY EARLY.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.491
DELIVERY DUDE
WOKE ME OUT OF BED.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.324
OK. YEAH.
THIS IS BAD.

03:14.368 --> 03:15.934
YEAH, BUT THE PICTURE'S
KIND OF CUTE.

03:17.284 --> 03:20.025
"30 UNDER 30."
YOURS TRULY.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.418
I MEAN, I NEED
TO HANG THIS UP.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.724
- GIVE ME THE NOTE.
- HERE.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.510
"YOU'RE WELCOME, FAM.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.512
SEE YOU AT THE
PRESS JUNKET. MARQUIS."

03:28.556 --> 03:31.036
YOUR BROTHER
GOT YOU ON THE LIST?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.213
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M A RISING STAR.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.518
BUT ALSO, HE USED
TO HOOK UP

03:34.562 --> 03:36.346
WITH THE EDITOR OF
THE "GAZETTE," SO...

03:36.390 --> 03:37.869
SO, YOU NOW HAVE
A PUBLIC DATE

03:37.913 --> 03:39.349
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS
WITH THE BROTHER

03:39.393 --> 03:40.698
THAT YOU HAVE TO
STAY AWAY FROM,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.091
OTHERWISE JADA JET
COMES KNIVES OUT

03:42.134 --> 03:43.266
FOR YOU, WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

03:43.310 --> 03:44.311
MAYBE EVEN YOUR
SECRET IDENTITY.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.921
I TRIED TO GHOST HIM, OK,

03:45.964 --> 03:49.229
BUT THE WORD IS OUT
AND GOTHAM'S CURIOUS.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.360
YOU KNOW
CHARLIE CLARKE, RIGHT?

03:50.404 --> 03:51.753
HEAD OF PR FOR WAYNE?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.102
OF COURSE.
CHARLIE'S BEEN AT WAYNE

03:53.145 --> 03:54.538
SINCE MY DAD
WAS STILL THERE.

03:54.582 --> 03:55.539
HE'S ONE OF BRUCE'S
INNER CIRCLE GUYS.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.237
OK, WELL, CHARLIE'S GOTTEN

03:57.280 --> 03:58.325
DOZENS OF REQUESTS

03:58.368 --> 03:59.369
TO INTERVIEW WAYNE'S

03:59.413 --> 04:01.545
HOT, YOUNG CEO--

04:01.589 --> 04:03.025
THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE--

04:03.068 --> 04:04.548
AND HE SAYS THAT IF
I SKIP OUT ON THIS EVENT,

04:04.592 --> 04:05.897
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
REPORTERS TRYING TO CLIMB

04:05.941 --> 04:08.552
THE WALLS OF WAYNE TOWER
TO GET ANSWERS.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.555
OK. WHAT'S YOUR
PLAN FOR WHEN

04:11.599 --> 04:12.861
YOU RUN INTO MARQUIS?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.648
FEEL THIS SHOULDER.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.564
COME ON.
FEEL IT.
FEEL IT.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.349
- COLD AS THEY COME
- OK.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.525
LOOK, IF I NEED
A CONVO BLOCKER,

04:24.568 --> 04:26.004
SOPHIE'S GONNA BE THERE.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.919
HER SIS IS ON THE LIST
FOR THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.878
OH. THAT IS
LEGITIMATELY COOL.

04:29.921 --> 04:33.925
GREAT. YOU BOTH
ARE HERE.

04:33.969 --> 04:38.278
CAN I RUN SOMETHING
CRAZY BY YOU?

04:38.321 --> 04:39.801
MY SWEET GIRL.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.933
DID YOU GO HOME
WITH A BOY LAST NIGHT?

04:41.977 --> 04:44.545
NO. SEE,
THAT'S THE THING.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.937
I'M PRETTY SURE
I SPENT THE NIGHT

04:45.981 --> 04:47.069
ASLEEP ON A BENCH

04:47.112 --> 04:48.375
IN THE MIDDLE OF
GOTHAM PARK.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.421
WHOO. SO,
BUSY MORNING.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.771
I SHOULD JET.
PUN INTENDED.

04:53.815 --> 04:54.816
GOOD LUCK.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.690
WOULD LUKE STILL
BE THIS UPSET

04:59.734 --> 05:02.302
IF NOTHING WAS
ACTUALLY WRONG?

05:02.345 --> 05:06.262
LUKE IS JUST FRUSTRATED.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.611
YOU TOLD ME HIS PTSD

05:07.655 --> 05:08.786
MADE HIM A RISK
IN THE FIELD.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.440
HE JUST WANTS US
TO BE ABLE TO

05:10.484 --> 05:11.746
KNOW WE CAN DEPEND ON HIM.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.400
DEPEND ON HIM?
YOU MEAN LIKE

05:13.443 --> 05:14.836
WHEN YOU WALK INTO
A ROOM AND SAY,

05:14.879 --> 05:16.577
"HEY, SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD

05:16.620 --> 05:18.361
JUST HAPPENED TO ME.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT?"

05:18.405 --> 05:20.537
HE'LL COME AROUND, OK?

05:20.581 --> 05:23.453
BUT I'M HERE TO LISTEN.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.848
I HAVE A JAM-PACKED DAY,
SO, CAN WE WALK AND TALK?

05:26.891 --> 05:30.808
THEN WE SHOULD
JUST TABLE MY DRAMA,

05:30.852 --> 05:34.421
BECAUSE I SORT OF NEED
AN ACTIVE LISTENER HERE.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.074
OK. HOW ABOUT THIS?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.424
I'LL BUY DRINKS
FOR HAPPY HOUR.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.469
THEN YOU CAN UNLOAD?

05:39.513 --> 05:43.560
SURE. I'LL JUST
JOURNAL UNTIL THEN.

06:00.229 --> 06:04.233
BREATHE. JUST BREATHE.

06:04.276 --> 06:07.192
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE IN THE
NORMAN BATES OF PSYCH WARDS,

06:07.236 --> 06:09.673
WITH A BILLION
NON-CONSENSUAL NANOBOTS

06:09.717 --> 06:11.153
SWIMMING THROUGH
YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.200
OH, WAIT.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.510
YOU'VE GOT MAIL.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.558
I HATE THAT I'M OLD ENOUGH
TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID THERE.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.046
THESE ARE FROM DADDY.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.048
THEY ALL ARE.
AN ENTIRE STACK

06:37.092 --> 06:39.181
FROM OLE JAILCROW
JACOB KANE.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.143
THESE MIS-DELIVERIES
ARE FROM

06:45.187 --> 06:48.146
THE WEEPY POST OFFICE
INSIDE MY SICK MIND.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.540
NOW, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A "YOU" PROBLEM.

06:54.936 --> 06:55.980
OOH!

06:59.070 --> 07:00.463
EXCUSE ME?

07:04.467 --> 07:06.077
HELP?

07:06.121 --> 07:07.818
KANE?

07:07.862 --> 07:09.559
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:11.343 --> 07:13.084
EVERYTHING LOOKS
NORMAL TO YOU?

07:15.391 --> 07:18.002
ROOM INSPECTIONS ARE
TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.

07:30.362 --> 07:34.323
- WHAT?
- I HAVE
JUST ONE MORE THING.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.630
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO RENEE MONTOYA.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.380
LET'S KEEP THINGS
MOVING, CHARLIE.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.599
I WANT TO MAKE
AN IMPRESSION,

07:49.643 --> 07:51.296
THEN LEAVE 'EM
WANTING MORE.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.776
GREAT NEWS--
THE CHAIRMAN OF
APEX BROADCASTING

07:52.820 --> 07:54.169
GOT AN EEL BONE
STUCK IN HIS THROAT,

07:54.212 --> 07:56.519
SO, THERE'S A PHOTO SESSION
SLOT AVAILABLE.

07:56.563 --> 07:57.912
LEAD THE WAY.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.522
WAYNE ENTERPRISES
IS SET TO MAKE

07:59.566 --> 08:00.741
ITS BIGGEST QUARTERLY
REVENUE GAINS

08:00.784 --> 08:02.133
IN 6 YEARS.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.657
I HAD TO BRIBE MR. WAYNE
WITH BLOODY MARYS

08:03.700 --> 08:05.920
TO GET HIM TO MEMORIZE
HIS TALKING POINTS.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.277
RYAN! RYAN! RYAN!

08:15.320 --> 08:16.887
...OVER HERE.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.502
YOU WANT TO
LET ME WORK?

08:22.545 --> 08:24.721
I CAN BARELY TELL
YOU'RE SMILING.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.506
COME ON!
SHOW GOTHAM

08:26.549 --> 08:28.203
THAT NEW FIRE
THAT'S TAKING OVER.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.511
RYAN, RYAN.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.819
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ISN'T SHE WONDERFUL, FOLKS?

08:35.863 --> 08:37.517
THAT'S MARQUIS JET.
I WANT THE CAMERAS

08:37.560 --> 08:38.822
TO GET A SHOT
OF YOU TOGETHER.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.260
THE JETS ARE
ICONS IN THIS CITY.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.699
WHY ARE YOU
AVOIDING ME?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.483
I THOUGHT THAT ONCE I
GOT YOU ON THIS LIST,

08:47.527 --> 08:48.484
YOU KNEW THAT
I WANTED--

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
TO PISS OFF YOUR MOM.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.921
HEY, I'M JUST MAKING UP

08:50.965 --> 08:52.270
FOR THE MISSED TIME
YOU HAD WITH

08:52.314 --> 08:53.837
OUR MOM IN
THE REBELLIOUS PHASE.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.536
IT'S MANIPULATIVE.
AND FRANKLY,

08:56.579 --> 08:58.668
IT PUTS MY BUSINESS
AT RISK.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.278
- LOOK, RYAN--
- HEY, GUYS.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.411
CAN I GET A SMILE?

09:02.454 --> 09:04.979
I'LL BE
REAL WITH YOU.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.720
I JUST WANTED TO DO
A NICE THING

09:06.763 --> 09:08.069
AND HOPEFULLY
HAVE A CHANCE

09:08.112 --> 09:09.897
TO HANG OUT WITH
MY SISTER, BUT

09:09.940 --> 09:11.942
IF THAT'S TOO
RISKY FOR YOU...

09:14.379 --> 09:15.685
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

09:15.729 --> 09:19.689
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.
YEAH.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.561
THIS IS LIKE
THE PUBLICIST

09:21.604 --> 09:22.823
HUNGER GAMES.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.128
DID YOU SEE THE SIGN
AT THE BAR

09:24.172 --> 09:25.782
THAT SAYS,
"THE FREE CHAMPAGNE

09:25.826 --> 09:27.610
IS FOR NOMINEES ONLY"?

09:27.654 --> 09:28.916
YOU WANT ME
TO GET YOU A GLASS,

09:28.959 --> 09:30.439
YOU SHOULD'VE BOUGHT ME
THAT BOX OF WINE

09:30.482 --> 09:31.614
I WANTED IN COLLEGE.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.007
OK, AS YOUR BIG SISTER,

09:33.050 --> 09:35.531
I STAND BEHIND
THAT DECISION.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.837
IT'S AS ON BRAND
FOR ME AS BEING

09:36.880 --> 09:40.318
HERE TODAY IS
OFF BRAND FOR YOU.

09:41.668 --> 09:42.712
AS AN HONOREE,
I GET A LITTLE

09:42.756 --> 09:44.584
SPEECH AT
THE PARTY LATER.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.586
TWO MINUTES,
ANYTHING I WANT TO SAY.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.370
MY PLAN IS TO SERENADE
THESE MONEYBAGS INTO

09:48.413 --> 09:50.894
QUADRUPLING THE COMMUNITY
CENTER'S BUDGET.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.940
IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
SHOT, RIGHT?

09:55.290 --> 09:58.032
THAT'S MY
"UNDER 30" BESTIE.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.470
ALWAYS GOT HER EYE
ON THE PRIZE, AND, UM...

10:06.910 --> 10:08.695
IT MUST RUN
IN THE FAMILY.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.613
UM, I HAVE SOMETHING

10:13.656 --> 10:15.615
EMBARRASSING TO
TELL YOU.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.878
I AM SO IN.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.967
I HAD A DREAM
ABOUT RYAN.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.099
- OK.
- I WAS IN BED.

10:22.143 --> 10:25.102
- OK.
- AND I MUST HAVE
BEEN SICK, BECAUSE

10:25.146 --> 10:27.191
SHE BROUGHT ME
SOME SOUP.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.410
WHAT KIND OF SOUP?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.195
I WOKE UP BEFORE I
COULD EVEN TRY IT.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.241
WHAT?

10:33.284 --> 10:34.285
YOU WOKE UP EARLY.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.723
IT'S A CLASSIC DREAM
ABOUT LONGING.

10:36.766 --> 10:37.941
I KNEW YOU
REALLY LIKED HER.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.682
WHY DID I TELL YOU THIS?

10:39.726 --> 10:43.947
JORDAN, IT WASN'T
A SEXUAL DREAM.
AT ALL.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.254
DID RYAN BRING
A FLOWER WITH THE SOUP?

10:47.603 --> 10:48.822
TOLD YA.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.998
HEY. I'M 31,
I HAVE NO CAREER,

10:51.041 --> 10:52.695
AND I AM SURROUNDED
BY ALL YOU

10:52.739 --> 10:54.741
SICK, LITTLE PRODIGIES,
AND MY BRAIN

10:54.784 --> 10:56.699
IS BEGGING ME,
"HEY, LOSER,

10:56.743 --> 10:58.309
CAN YOU AT LEAST
FIND A GIRLFRIEND?"

10:58.353 --> 11:01.704
BUT...THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT HAS TO BE RYAN.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.098
OR, AND HEAR ME OUT
ON THIS,

11:04.141 --> 11:06.535
RYAN WILDER IS
HOT AS HELL,

11:06.578 --> 11:09.103
AND YOU'RE
AMAZING TOGETHER.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.021
YOU'RE STARING AGAIN.
I JUST--

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TO GO.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.154
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- TO THE BATHROOM?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.808
WORRY ABOUT
YOUR SPEECH.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.076
JORDAN MOORE.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.382
I'M FROM THE "GAZETTE."

11:27.425 --> 11:29.036
WE'RE READY TO SIT
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

11:29.079 --> 11:31.908
O-OK, SURE.
LET ME JUST GRAB
MY PUBLICIST.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.301
THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.494
VESPER FAIRCHILD IS HOLDING.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.066
VESPER, IT'S JADA.

12:00.589 --> 12:04.332
I HAPPENED TO GLANCE
AT LAST WEEK'S RATINGS.

12:04.375 --> 12:09.032
OUCH. IT'S A CROWDED
LANDSCAPE, MY DEAR,

12:09.076 --> 12:11.731
BUT I WANT TO HELP YOU
MAKE SOME NOISE.

12:11.774 --> 12:15.735
YES, I HAVE A SCOOP.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.655
EXPLAIN THIS NEW
HOBBY TO ME.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.222
ONLY IF YOU EXPLAIN
WHY MONTOYA

12:25.266 --> 12:27.311
DROPPED YOU OFF
FOR ME TO BABY-SIT.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.580
I HAVE
URGENT INFORMATION

12:35.624 --> 12:37.017
TO HELP BATWOMAN RECOVER

12:37.060 --> 12:40.237
THE INFAMOUS
"ZERO-G" SNEAKERS

12:40.281 --> 12:42.674
USED BY BATMAN'S
LONG-AGO FALLEN

12:42.718 --> 12:45.547
AND TRAGICALLY
ARROGANT FOE

12:45.590 --> 12:46.635
THE MIGHTY ICARUS.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.071
ICARUS?

12:48.115 --> 12:50.247
SOUNDS LIKE A DEEP CUT.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.901
ACTUALLY,
IT'S FAKE, BUT

12:51.945 --> 12:52.989
SHE'LL BELIEVE
ANYTHING IF YOU

12:53.033 --> 12:54.730
LOWER YOUR VOICE
AN OCTAVE.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.340
IT'S CONVINCING, RIGHT?

12:56.384 --> 12:58.168
CONVINCE ME

12:58.212 --> 12:59.517
NOT TO TELL MONTOYA THAT

12:59.561 --> 13:01.432
THERE IS NO MIGHTY ICARUS.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.870
WELL, FOR ONE,
YOU'RE LONELY.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.089
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
DO EACH OTHER'S NAILS

13:06.133 --> 13:08.439
OR TRY A FEW
ELECTIVE SURGERIES.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.920
MM-HMM. THERE HAS TO
BE SOME REASON

13:10.964 --> 13:13.227
WHY YOU'RE PLAYING
HOOKY FROM ARKHAM.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.275
UHH. WELL, I HATE
TO ADMIT ANYTHING

13:18.319 --> 13:20.887
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
SOUND WEAK,

13:20.930 --> 13:23.803
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

13:23.846 --> 13:25.805
I'M HERE TO DO
BATWOMAN A FAVOR.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.112
MM. WELL, KEEP GOING.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.592
SO FAR, THIS STORY'S
BETTER THAN

13:30.635 --> 13:32.072
YOUR NANOBOT COLD.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.336
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.338
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT TROPHY

13:37.381 --> 13:39.470
THE BAT TEAM IS
HEROICALLY TRACKING DOWN

13:39.514 --> 13:41.037
AT THIS VERY MOMENT
TO KEEP

13:41.081 --> 13:42.386
THE GOTHAM STREETS SAFE

13:42.430 --> 13:43.953
AND APPEASE
THE TYRANT THAT IS

13:43.997 --> 13:45.955
FORCING US
TO WORK TOGETHER?

13:45.999 --> 13:47.478
SOMETHING CAME UP.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.916
WE'LL GET BACK TO
RENEE'S TREASURE HUNT TOMORROW.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.875
HMM. NO JUDGMENT
HERE, BUT

13:52.919 --> 13:54.921
I WONDER IF
RENEE WOULD BE AS

13:54.964 --> 13:56.879
GENEROUS TOWARD
THIS WHOLE

13:56.923 --> 13:59.186
WORK-LIFE BALANCE?

13:59.229 --> 14:02.058
I GUESS YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHEN YOU CALL HER.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.323
FINE. YOU WIN. JUST...

14:06.367 --> 14:10.284
DON'T BOTHER ANYONE
WHO COMES IN.

14:17.639 --> 14:18.988
THANK YOU.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.123
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'VE
NEVER HAD MEDIA TRAINING.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.342
JUST HIGHLY MOTIVATED.
WHO'S NEXT?

14:25.386 --> 14:27.040
LET ME SHOOT THE
"GAZETTE" A QUICK TEXT

14:27.083 --> 14:29.651
AND SEE IF THEY'RE
READY FOR YOU.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.566
FIGURED YOU'D CHILL IF
I BOUGHT A DISGUISE,

14:31.609 --> 14:34.351
SO, THEY HAD THIS SICK
COLORWAY AT THE GIFT SHOP.

14:34.395 --> 14:37.267
"WHO'S THAN MAN
WITH RYAN WILDER?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.661
IS HE HANDSOME?
I CAN'T TELL."

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
YEAH, YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDA GOT SOME AVIATORS.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.186
I SHOULD'VE.
THEY'RE TWO-FOR-ONE.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.928
- DO YOU WANT IN?

14:45.972 --> 14:47.974
HEY, RYAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN JORDAN?

14:48.017 --> 14:48.975
SHE'S LATE FOR
AN INTERVIEW

14:49.018 --> 14:50.150
AND HER PHONE IS OFF.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.151
NEVER LET THE CLIENT

14:51.194 --> 14:52.543
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.371
I'M MORE PUBLISISTER
THAN PUBLICIST, SO...

14:54.415 --> 14:56.504
I'D HAVE GUESSED PRINT MODEL.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.375
COOL HAT.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.987
MARQUIS JET.
I'M RYAN'S BROTHER.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.597
SOPHIE MOORE. RYAN'S--

15:02.640 --> 15:04.164
VERY GOOD FRIEND
WHO NEEDS HELP

15:04.207 --> 15:05.817
FINDING HER
BABY SISTER.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.558
THE "GAZETTE"
SAYS THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.517
CAN WE PUSH THIS OFF
UNTIL AFTER THE INTERVIEW?

15:09.560 --> 15:10.735
MY GIRL COMES FIRST.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.085
SEE IF THAT DUDE GOT
RID OF THE EEL BONE YET.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.390
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.921
OK. REBOOTING...

15:21.964 --> 15:24.097
VOICE INTERFACE.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.489
REBOOTING SYSTEM LOADER.

15:28.101 --> 15:31.147
DAD? IT'S LUKE.
ARE YOU THERE?

15:40.287 --> 15:41.984
THE SILENT TREATMENT'S
GETTING OLD.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.553
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
LEAVE ME HANGING WITH THE MOST

15:45.596 --> 15:48.295
SOPHISTICATED PERSONAL
FLIGHT SUIT ON THE PLANET?

15:55.302 --> 15:57.957
IS THIS ABOUT
THE FAILSAFE?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.132
YOU'RE MAD BECAUSE
I TURNED IT OFF?

15:59.175 --> 16:00.220
BECAUSE THAT'S ON YOU.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.048
IT MALFUNCTIONED. SO...

16:05.703 --> 16:07.749
YOU KNOW, IT ALSO
ALMOST GOT ME KILLED,

16:07.792 --> 16:10.230
SO, NO, I'M NOT
TURNING IT BACK ON.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.884
MY SUIT, MY DECISION.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.974
BATWOMAN TO BATCAVE.
YOU THERE?

16:17.193 --> 16:19.979
YEAH, JUST...
TALKING TO MY WARDROBE.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.197
HAVING A NORMAL ONE.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.332
BATWOMAN. HEY.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.029
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.031
I NEED AN ASSIST.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.728
SOPHIE'S SISTER JORDAN
IS M.I.A.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.339
TOO MANY MAI TAIS
AT THE OPEN BAR?

16:32.382 --> 16:34.123
OH, I HOPE NOT.
I CLEANED UP ENOUGH

16:34.167 --> 16:35.559
PUKE IN MY OLD JOB.

16:35.603 --> 16:36.908
I GOT A PING
ON HER CELL PHONE.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.388
SO, LET ME JUST NARROW DOWN

16:38.432 --> 16:40.434
THE LOCATION RADIUS
WITH THE HOTEL WI-FI.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.049
NOT TO BE A DOWNER
AT A PARTY,

16:47.093 --> 16:48.355
BUT IT MIGHT BE
TIME TO PANIC.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.921
IS SOMETHING
GOING ON WITH HER?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.836
SHE SEEMED NERVOUS
BUT ONLY BECAUSE

16:51.880 --> 16:53.229
SHE HAD A SPEECH LATER.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.665
FACIAL RECOGNITION
SAYS NO JORDAN

16:54.709 --> 16:56.711
ON ANY OF THE EXTERIOR
HOTEL CAMS,

16:56.754 --> 16:58.626
SO, SHE MUST STILL BE
ON THE PREMISES.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.107
HEY, I JUST
GOT A TIP

17:01.150 --> 17:02.151
THAT YOUR SISTER
WAS SPOTTED

17:02.195 --> 17:03.500
UPSTAIRS
AT THE HOTEL.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.068
SOME MAN BROUGHT HER
INTO ROOM 1620.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.417
LET'S GO.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.853
OK, YOU STAY HERE.
KEEP AN EYE OUT.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.464
CALL ME IF SHE
COMES BACK DOWN.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.165
JORDAN?

17:16.209 --> 17:17.862
OH, MY GOD.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.908
NO.
DON'T TOUCH HER.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.692
NOT TILL WE KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.564
WHO THE HELL WOULD
DO THIS TO HER?

17:26.132 --> 17:28.395
I'VE SEEN THIS
EQUIPMENT BEFORE.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.440
THIS IS
MR. FREEZE'S DESIGN.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.182
FREEZE SERUM
DID THIS?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.097
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU GOT THAT

17:35.141 --> 17:36.403
STUFF OFF THE STREETS.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.100
I GOT THE ORIGINAL
CANISTER BACK,

17:38.144 --> 17:41.103
BUT MAYBE SOMEONE
FOUND MORE.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.800
WHY WOULD THEY
DO THIS TO JORDAN?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.194
AND HOW ARE THEY
DOING THIS

17:45.238 --> 17:48.197
WITHOUT A CRYOCHAMBER?

17:48.241 --> 17:51.548
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL HANDLE IT.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.333
- I HAVE TO MOVE HER.
- YOU CANNOT

17:53.376 --> 17:54.334
WARM HER, SOPHIE.

17:54.377 --> 17:55.596
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.206
THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE TRIED THAT,

17:57.250 --> 17:59.208
SHE AGED AT 4 TIMES
THE NORMAL RATE.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.123
THIS IS MY SISTER, RYAN.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.559
SHE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.

18:02.603 --> 18:07.129
I KNOW.
WE WILL FIGURE
THIS OUT TOGETHER.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.399
THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM IS

18:16.443 --> 18:17.835
BASED ON
VICTOR FRIES' RESEARCH,

18:17.879 --> 18:20.751
BUT WHAT USED TO HAPPEN
INSIDE A CHAMBER

18:20.795 --> 18:23.189
IS NOW HAPPENING
INSIDE JORDAN'S CELLS.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.408
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW TO UNDO IT.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.497
TELL ME HOW TO HELP.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.283
THE MAIN
COMPLICATION THAT WE SEE

18:30.326 --> 18:32.546
WITH FRIES' CRYO-STASIS
IS RAPID AGING,

18:32.589 --> 18:37.377
BUT THIS IS SO MUCH
MORE INVASIVE.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.682
IF I HAD TO GUESS

18:38.726 --> 18:41.120
WHAT THIS COULD DO
TO ORGANIC TISSUE...

18:43.296 --> 18:44.471
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A PIECE OF

18:44.514 --> 18:46.516
PETRIFIED WOOD BEFORE?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.257
WE SHOULD JUST PAUSE
ON THAT ANALOGY

18:48.301 --> 18:50.259
AND JUST FOCUS.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

18:50.303 --> 18:52.305
WANT ME TO GO TO THE STORE
FOR A HAIR DRYER?

18:53.436 --> 18:55.221
WHY THE HELL IS
ALICE EVEN HERE?

18:55.264 --> 18:57.440
IT'S REALLY NOT EVEN
WORTH EXPLAINING.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.574
LOOK, IF I CAN GET
A CLEAN SAMPLE

19:00.617 --> 19:01.836
OF THIS NEW
FREEZE SERUM,

19:01.879 --> 19:03.185
I THINK I COULD

19:03.229 --> 19:04.186
FIGURE OUT
A SAFE WAY TO

19:04.230 --> 19:05.448
BRING JORDAN OUT OF CRYO.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.189
THEN WE SHOULD
FIND OUT WHO MADE IT

19:07.233 --> 19:08.451
AND SEE IF
THEY HAVE MORE.

19:08.495 --> 19:09.800
WERE THEY WORKING
WITH ANYONE

19:09.844 --> 19:11.585
AT THE HOTEL OR
WITH THE EVENT?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.500
WE SHOULD HAVE LUKE
CHECK EVERY CAMERA SYSTEM

19:13.543 --> 19:14.631
TO SEE IF
HE CAN PULL--

19:14.675 --> 19:18.418
I GOT IT.
IT'S THE BEE GEES.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.594
OF COURSE IT'S THEM.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.162
DID YOU TAKE
MY SISTER'S PHONE?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.773
OH. YEAH.
AND, UM, YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.818
FOR CRITIQUING
HER STATE IN MUSIC?

19:27.862 --> 19:31.518
NO. FOR SOLVING
ALL YOUR LITTLE MYSTERIES.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.954
WHO KIDNAPPED JORDAN,
WHO'S EXPERIMENTING

19:32.997 --> 19:34.477
WITH THE FREEZE FORMULA.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.872
SAME ANSWER.
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY.

19:41.876 --> 19:45.227
THE BGS.
THE BEE GEES.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.449
THEY RULE THE CITY
FROM THE SHADOWS.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.190
THEY WANT TO LIVE FOREVER.
YOU KNOW.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.322
USUAL BIG-MONEY
PERVERT STUFF.

19:53.366 --> 19:55.803
SHE'S RIGHT.
JORDAN AND HER FRIENDS

19:55.846 --> 19:57.370
WERE COLLECTING
INFORMATION ON

19:57.413 --> 19:59.720
SOME BLACK
GLOVE SOCIETY.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.332
SHE WAS GOING
TO USE HER SPEECH

20:03.376 --> 20:04.855
FROM THE "30 UNDER 30"

20:04.899 --> 20:07.249
TO UNMASK THE SOCIETY
AND SHUT IT DOWN.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.685
NOW THAT IS
A GREAT WAY TO

20:08.729 --> 20:10.339
MAKE YOURSELF
A TARGET OF GOTHAM'S

20:10.383 --> 20:12.646
OLDEST SECRET SOCIETY OF
THE RICH AND POWERFUL.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.213
I'LL SEND THIS
INFO TO LUKE

20:14.256 --> 20:15.344
SO HE CAN CHECK
ON THE OTHERS

20:15.388 --> 20:16.780
AND SEE IF
THEY'RE OK.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.659
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

20:27.487 --> 20:31.230
YOU?
SPECIAL AGENT
PLAY-IT-SAFE?

20:35.059 --> 20:37.279
SHE KNEW YOU'D TRY TO
TALK HER OUT OF IT.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.328
UH, MARY?

20:42.371 --> 20:43.981
I DON'T THINK HER
TEMPERATURE'S STABLE.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.293
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.903
THE FORMULA MUST BE
BREAKING DOWN

20:52.947 --> 20:54.253
INSIDE OF HER BODY.

20:54.296 --> 20:55.384
UGH. IF I COULD JUST

20:55.428 --> 20:57.168
GET A SAMPLE OF THIS FORMULA,

20:57.212 --> 20:58.561
I COULD FIGURE ALL OF THIS OUT.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.693
IT'S TOO BAD
WE CAN'T JUST ASK HER

20:59.736 --> 21:01.521
HOW TO FIND THE BEE GEES.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.349
SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY
CLOSE ENOUGH TO SOMETHING

21:03.392 --> 21:05.655
FOR THEM TO TURN HER
INTO A POPSICLE.

21:05.699 --> 21:06.961
ALICE, YOU'RE
COMING WITH ME.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.223
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.311
I CAN'T JUST
WAIT FOR RYAN

21:09.355 --> 21:10.747
TO SOLVE THIS FOR ME.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.401
WE'RE GONNA SEARCH
JORDAN'S APARTMENT.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.098
IF SHE'S GOT ANY OTHER
EVIDENCE ON BLACK GLOVE,

21:14.142 --> 21:15.448
IT'LL BE HIDDEN THERE.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.451
JUST GOT THE BLACK GLOVE
FILES FROM SOPHIE.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.322
GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO SEE
WHAT JORDAN HAD ON HERE.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.938
NOTHING THEY DO
IS DIGITAL.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.549
MAYBE THAT'S HOW
THEY STAY OFF THE RADAR.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.159
NO COMPUTERS.
NOTHING ON THE CLOUD.

21:31.202 --> 21:32.203
NOTHING WE
CAN USE TO GET

21:32.247 --> 21:34.075
A NAME OR A LOCATION?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.206
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE

21:35.250 --> 21:36.643
JORDAN WAS TEXTING EARLIER?

21:36.686 --> 21:38.558
M.I.A.
THEY ALL MET UP AT THE HOTEL

21:38.601 --> 21:40.299
BUT THEN THEY ALL WENT DARK.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.604
I BET THAT'S WHY
BLACK GLOVE DOES

21:41.648 --> 21:43.302
THEIR FREEZE EXPERIMENTS
AT THE HOTEL.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.304
ONE-STOP SHOPPING FOR EVERYONE
WHO HAS IT OUT FOR THEM.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.436
OH, MY GOD.
THE CORONER IS TAKING

21:47.480 --> 21:49.873
SOMEONE OUT OF
THE HOTEL IN PIECES.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.788
PROBABLY ONE OF
JORDAN'S TEAM.

21:52.876 --> 21:56.140
OK. I'M GOING UP
TO THE HOTEL.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.142
WE GOTTA FIND
THE OTHER ONE.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.448
DID YOU HAVE EYES ON MARQUIS

21:59.492 --> 22:00.971
AROUND THE TIME THAT
JORDAN WENT MISSING?

22:01.015 --> 22:02.973
- WHY?
- BGS IS BIG MONEY.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.585
FLASHY GUYS DOING WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO STAY POWERFUL.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.630
HE WOULD FIT PERFECTLY
INTO THAT CROWD.

22:07.674 --> 22:08.979
FIND YOUR FRIEND'S SISTER?

22:09.023 --> 22:10.329
YEAH. I DID. THANKS.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.200
RIGHT WHERE YOU
SAID SHE'D BE.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.593
GLAD I COULD
BE OF SERVICE.

22:13.636 --> 22:14.985
I BET HE IS.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.160
HOW'D HE KNOW
WHICH ROOM JORDAN WAS IN

22:16.204 --> 22:17.988
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.990
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HER?

22:20.034 --> 22:22.384
I KNOW A GIRL WHO WORKS
AT THE FRONT DESK.

22:22.428 --> 22:23.864
SHE ASKED AROUND FOR ME.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.387
ONE OF THE HOUSEKEEPERS
SAID THAT SHE SAW

22:25.431 --> 22:26.562
SOMEONE WHO LOOKED
LIKE JORDAN

22:26.606 --> 22:27.563
BEING LED INTO
A BEDROOM

22:27.607 --> 22:28.651
BY SOME OLDER GUY.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.871
I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU. OK?

22:30.914 --> 22:31.915
BUT LIKE I SAID,

22:31.959 --> 22:33.395
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW YOU, MARQUIS.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.005
I ACTUALLY
CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.572
FOR WHAT?

22:36.616 --> 22:38.922
YOU THINK JADA'S
CRAZY, ANGRY,

22:38.966 --> 22:41.316
CONTROL-FREAK THING
IS SOMETHING NEW?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.839
THIS HAS BEEN
MY WHOLE LIFE.

22:42.883 --> 22:47.583
ONLY CHILD.
I WANTED TO
KNOW YOU SO BAD.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.499
I THOUGHT,
FINALLY, MY SISTER.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.153
WE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.415
BUT I GUESS NOT.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.679
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

22:56.723 --> 22:59.421
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT
AFTER WE HELP JORDAN.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.988
IS YOUR PHONE SERIOUSLY
NOT ON RIGHT NOW?

23:01.031 --> 23:03.251
CHARLIE, SORRY.
SHE'S ON SILENT.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.557
LOOK, I JUST
RAN INTO SOME

23:04.600 --> 23:05.732
MOVERS AND SHAKERS
AT THE HOTEL,

23:05.775 --> 23:07.211
SO, I GOTTA GET BACK
TO IT, OK?

23:07.255 --> 23:08.474
LOOK.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.479
RYAN, WHY IS HE SO PISSED?

23:18.135 --> 23:19.876
BUILD YOU UP JUST SO
THEY CAN KNOCK YOU DOWN.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.488
OK. BETTER GIVE ME
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.490
5 MINUTES AGO,
VESPER FAIRCHILD

23:24.533 --> 23:25.795
BROKE THE SCOOP
THAT THE CEO

23:25.839 --> 23:27.493
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES
HAS BEEN DIVERTING

23:27.536 --> 23:28.798
TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS

23:28.842 --> 23:31.235
INTO SECRET ACCOUNTS
FOR HER OWN USE.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.541
JADA.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.456
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH OUR CFO.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.805
HE'S STARTED DOING
AN AUDIT OF OUR

23:35.849 --> 23:37.285
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS
AND HE AGREES

23:37.328 --> 23:38.547
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

23:38.591 --> 23:41.071
WHAT? NO.
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.986
OK, LOOK.
I WILL TALK TO HIM

23:43.030 --> 23:45.598
AND SORT THIS OUT,
BUT JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.209
OH, DO YOU HAVE A MORE
DESPERATE CRISIS?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.471
THEY SAY MULTITASKING IS

23:49.515 --> 23:50.603
THE HARDEST PART
OF THE JOB.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.474
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.258
OK. DON'T WORRY.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.609
I WILL GET A BOX FOR
MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.088
GIRL, WHEN YOU CATCH
BERNIE MADOFF--

23:58.132 --> 24:00.090
IN THIS CASE, YOU--
STEALING MONEY,

24:00.134 --> 24:01.352
YOU DON'T FIRE HER.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.745
YOU ARREST HER.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.808
TELL ME SOMETHING
GOOD, LUKE.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.766
MAYBE LIKE JADA JET
HACKED OUR SYSTEMS

24:23.810 --> 24:25.420
AND FAKED ALL THAT
HIDDEN MONEY.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.813
RYAN, SHE DIDN'T FAKE THIS.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.510
WHY AM I THE LAST PERSON
TO KNOW THAT

24:28.554 --> 24:29.729
I HAVE 8 FIGURES STASHED

24:29.772 --> 24:31.121
UNDER A MATTRESS SOMEWHERE?

24:31.165 --> 24:32.949
CAN YOU THINK OF
ANY OPERATIONS THAT

24:32.993 --> 24:34.821
ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE,
SECRETIVE,

24:34.864 --> 24:35.996
AND CAN ONLY
BE AUTHORIZED BY

24:36.039 --> 24:37.998
THE CEO OF
WAYNE ENTERPRISES?

24:38.955 --> 24:41.915
BATMAN. AND NOW BATWOMAN.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.569
THAT MONEY IS OUR
OPERATING BUDGET.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.266
LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW JADA GOT ACCESS

24:45.309 --> 24:47.964
TO OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS,
SO, THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS

24:48.008 --> 24:49.444
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
THE MONEY IS FOR,

24:49.488 --> 24:52.534
JUST THAT SHE COULD
PIN IT ON YOU.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.623
LUKE, I GIVE UP.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.972
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.452
THE COPS COULD
WALK IN ANY SECOND

24:57.496 --> 24:59.193
AND I'M FREEZING
MY ASS OFF.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.762
GCPD HAS THERMAL
IMAGING CAMERAS

25:02.805 --> 25:04.154
ALL OVER THE CITY.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.634
LET ME TAP IN, SEE IF
ANY OF THE OTHER ROOMS

25:05.678 --> 25:06.983
HAVE ABNORMAL TEMPERATURES.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.899
I'M NOT SEEING
ANY ICE BOXES.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.989
LUKE? I'M SEEING A BUNCH
OF HEAT LAMPS HERE.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.208
MAYBE THEY WERE GETTING READY

25:14.251 --> 25:15.557
TO TRY THAWING HER.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.863
IF THEY DID THAT
IN ANOTHER ROOM...

25:16.906 --> 25:18.386
THEN ON THERMAL IMAGING
IT WOULD LOOK

25:18.429 --> 25:20.867
MORE LIKE A SAUNA.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.827
OK. BINGO.
GET READY TO SUIT UP.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.526
OHH.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.571
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

25:29.615 --> 25:31.007
DEAD BODY.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.270
THEY TRIED TO UNFREEZE IT.
DIDN'T WORK.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.543
POSITIVE I.D.
SHE'S THE OTHER ONE

25:44.586 --> 25:45.761
IN JORDAN'S GROUP TEXT.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.938
NO SIGN OF BLACK GLOVE.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.030
I JUST RAN THE NAME
OF THE OTHER GUY
IN THE GROUP TEXT.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.684
ACCORDING TO THE GCPD,
HE WAS THE ONE

25:55.728 --> 25:57.512
THEY JUST WHEELED
OUT OF THERE.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.905
JORDAN'S THE ONLY
ONE LEFT.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.609
HEY, NO SASS.
YOU LIVED IN A SEWER.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.132
I'LL TAKE THE BEDROOM.
REMEMBER,

26:09.176 --> 26:10.699
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
ANYTHING LOW-TECH.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.658
ANYTHING CONNECTED
TO BLACK GLOVE.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.789
IF JORDAN KNEW
IT WAS DANGEROUS,

26:13.833 --> 26:15.312
IT WON'T BE
OUT IN THE OPEN.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.758
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.722
HOW'S YOUR NECK?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.291
THAT'S HURTFUL.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.336
ARE YOU
TALKING TO SOMEONE?

26:39.380 --> 26:41.512
OH, NO. HEH.

26:41.556 --> 26:42.688
NO, I JUST LIKE TO

26:42.731 --> 26:43.950
SAY THE DETAILS OUT LOUD.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.647
PLEASE RESPECT
MY PROCESS AND

26:45.691 --> 26:46.953
GO BACK TO
PICKING THROUGH

26:46.996 --> 26:48.694
YOUR SISTER'S
UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

26:49.782 --> 26:51.000
GO, GO.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.052
YOU WANT MY TWO CENTS?

27:01.271 --> 27:03.447
FIRST OF ALL,
THEY'RE MY TWO CENTS.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.972
SECOND OF ALL, SHUT UP.
I'M WORKING.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.061
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO READ
THOSE POSTCARDS.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.890
YOU DON'T LIKE FEELING
THOSE LITTLE MACHINES

27:10.933 --> 27:12.935
SWIM AROUND IN YOU
LIKE GUPPIES.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.895
YOU BROKE MY DAMN NECK.

27:18.071 --> 27:19.768
I'M SORRY.
DO I SEEM

27:19.812 --> 27:21.683
A TEENSY BIT ON EDGE?

27:21.727 --> 27:23.642
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
THE FABRIC OF MY REALITY

27:23.685 --> 27:25.382
IS COLLAPSING AROUND ME!

27:25.426 --> 27:27.863
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
KEEPING IT TOGETHER IN THERE?

27:27.907 --> 27:30.213
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW,

27:30.257 --> 27:31.911
JUST OVERCOMING
THE MOLD OF YOUR

27:31.954 --> 27:35.175
SISTER'S DUSTY
MANIFESTOS.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.699
MAYBE IF YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS REAL ABOUT

27:37.743 --> 27:39.005
YOURSELF, BETH...

27:40.963 --> 27:43.792
THE REST OF THE WORLD
WOULD FALL BACK INTO PLACE.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.862
SHE UNMASKED THE BEE GEES.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.517
OH, WOW.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.041
THAT DOESN'T
BELONG TO YOU.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.697
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.007
JUST TAKING A SHOT HERE.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.443
ARE YOU MAKE-BELIEVE?

28:28.054 --> 28:29.185
I'M HERE FOR
EVERYTHING THAT WAS

28:29.229 --> 28:30.839
SCANNED INTO
THE GIRL'S PHONE.

28:36.758 --> 28:37.933
PRO TIP...

28:39.413 --> 28:40.762
BUY A DOCUMENT SHREDDER.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.336
AAH!

29:25.894 --> 29:26.982
WHAT'S UP, LUKE?

29:27.026 --> 29:28.114
YOU DIDN'T GIVE US
AN UPDATE

29:28.157 --> 29:30.812
ON YOUR PROGRESS
WITH JORDAN.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.118
I'M TRYING TO
KEEP HER STABLE

29:32.161 --> 29:33.206
UNTIL SOMEONE
COMES THROUGH WITH

29:33.249 --> 29:34.685
A SAMPLE OF
THE FORMULA.

29:34.729 --> 29:35.817
YOU'VE HAD HER
LONG ENOUGH TO ANALYZE

29:35.861 --> 29:36.905
EVERY ANGLE,
RUN EVERY TEST,

29:36.949 --> 29:38.080
AND YOU'VE STILL
GOT NOTHING?

29:38.124 --> 29:40.256
WOW. NO PRESSURE, HUH?

29:40.300 --> 29:42.084
IF YOU GET TO JUDGE ME
FOR HOW I'M PERFORMING
IN THE CLUTCH,

29:42.128 --> 29:43.782
WHY CAN'T I DO
THE SAME FOR YOU?

29:43.825 --> 29:44.913
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU,

29:44.957 --> 29:46.306
NOT SCORE POINTS IN SOME

29:46.349 --> 29:48.134
"WHO'S THE BEST HERO"
COMPETITION.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.613
LOOK, I'M NOT
DUNKING ON YOU.

29:49.657 --> 29:50.919
I'M JUST REMINDING YOU
THAT YOU

29:50.963 --> 29:52.616
DECLARED YOURSELF
TEAM DOCTOR.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.792
YEAH. I'M TRYING.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.228
BUT I CAN BARELY
SEE STRAIGHT

29:55.271 --> 29:57.056
BECAUSE I SPENT
THE NIGHT IN THE PARK,

29:57.099 --> 30:00.146
WHICH NOBODY KNOWS
ABOUT BECAUSE NOBODY
ACTUALLY CARES.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.367
WHAT IS IT?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.282
I CAN HEAR IT.
YOU JUST GOT AN IDEA, RIGHT?

30:06.326 --> 30:09.285
ANIMALS NEVER EVOLVED
TO WITHSTAND FREEZING,

30:09.329 --> 30:11.766
BUT PLANTS HAVE
ORGANIC MATERIAL

30:11.810 --> 30:12.811
THAT'S PERFECTLY ADAPTED

30:12.854 --> 30:14.247
TO FREEZING AND THAWING.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.727
AND THEY SURVIVE WINTER
BY SYNTHESIZING

30:16.771 --> 30:18.120
A TYPE OF ANTIFREEZE

30:18.164 --> 30:20.253
INSIDE THEIR
VASCULAR TISSUE.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.693
THE KEY IS TO THAW
FROM THE INSIDE,

30:25.736 --> 30:27.260
NOT THE OUTSIDE.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.652
AND YOU THINK THIS
COULD BE A WAY TO

30:28.696 --> 30:30.002
SAFELY UNFREEZE JORDAN?

30:32.700 --> 30:33.788
NO. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

30:33.832 --> 30:35.485
A FUN FACT ABOUT PLANTS.

30:43.754 --> 30:46.018
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

30:46.061 --> 30:47.497
GASOLINE.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.546
ALICE. ALICE!

31:01.033 --> 31:02.861
THAT'S A LITTLE
ON THE NOSE, BUT

31:02.904 --> 31:05.211
THE BOOKS ARE
A NICE TOUCH.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.865
HEY, WHERE'S YOUR KNIFE?

31:06.908 --> 31:08.431
THE BEE GEES TOOK IT,

31:08.475 --> 31:09.868
ALONG WITH ALL
THE EVIDENCE I FOUND

31:09.911 --> 31:11.173
IN JORDAN'S HIDEY HOLE.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.522
STOP TRYING TO MAKE
"BEE GEES" HAPPEN!

31:12.566 --> 31:14.873
JEEZ. MISDIRECTED
ANGER, MUCH?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.222
MISDIRECTED?

31:16.265 --> 31:18.354
THIS IS COMPLETELY
YOUR FAULT.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.052
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE ALICE,

31:20.095 --> 31:21.531
A LEGIT SUPER VILLAIN.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.490
THE ONLY REASON
THESE GUYS JUMPED YOU

31:23.533 --> 31:24.926
IS BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE TALKING TO

31:24.970 --> 31:26.841
SOME GUY WHO
WASN'T EVEN THERE.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.277
YEAH, I NOTICED.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.412
SOMETIMES, I--

31:32.455 --> 31:34.022
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S
REAL AND WHAT'S NOT,

31:34.066 --> 31:35.067
AND IT USED TO ONLY
HAPPEN AT ARKHAM,

31:35.110 --> 31:36.198
BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE

31:36.242 --> 31:38.374
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.507
AND I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO HELP ME.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.426
OH, THAT'S ONE WAY
TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.688
SORRY, JORDAN.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.722
HEY. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

32:25.813 --> 32:27.989
I WISH YOU HAD
TOLD ME.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.295
I COULD'VE HELPED.

32:30.252 --> 32:35.954
I WILL ALWAYS
SUPPORT YOU, JORDAN.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.216
ALWAYS.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.785
SHE'LL NEED
SOME MORE TIME

32:41.829 --> 32:43.874
BEFORE SHE CAN TALK AGAIN.

32:43.918 --> 32:46.790
HER ENTIRE BODY IS RESETTING.

32:46.834 --> 32:49.141
AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE,
SHE MIGHT SMELL LIKE

32:49.184 --> 32:51.012
CILANTRO FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS,

32:51.056 --> 32:53.319
BUT SHE'S GONNA MAKE
A FULL RECOVERY.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.016
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.409
CAN WE EAT NOW?

33:00.761 --> 33:02.806
I AM SO SORRY, SOPH.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.634
I SAID I'D HANDLE THIS.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.245
AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE

33:06.288 --> 33:08.508
OR WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH THE FREEZE SERUM.

33:08.551 --> 33:09.726
JORDAN'S OK.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.815
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

33:11.859 --> 33:13.469
SO, HOW DID YOU KNOW
TO COME TO THE APARTMENT?

33:13.513 --> 33:15.123
LUKE FIGURED OUT
THEY WERE AFTER

33:15.167 --> 33:18.213
THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS
JORDAN HAD ON HER PHONE.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.998
I'M NOT GOING TO LET
BLACK GLOVE

33:20.041 --> 33:21.303
GET ANOTHER SHOT
AT HER.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.348
YEAH, WELL, THEY ALMOST

33:22.391 --> 33:23.740
BURNED ME AT THE STAKE,

33:23.784 --> 33:25.786
SO, YOU'RE GETTING
MY HELP ON THIS.

33:25.829 --> 33:27.222
AND ALICE'S, TOO,

33:27.266 --> 33:29.094
WHETHER WE WANT IT
OR NOT.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.141
MARY.

33:34.186 --> 33:35.448
SO, ALICE TOLD ME

33:35.491 --> 33:37.363
HER PSYCHOSIS
IS GETTING WORSE

33:37.406 --> 33:39.843
AND SHE SUSPECTS
THE DOCTORS DON'T CARE.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.541
HONESTLY?

33:41.584 --> 33:42.846
IT'S ARKHAM.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.283
WHATEVER MEDS
THEY'RE GIVING HER IN THERE

33:44.326 --> 33:45.936
COULD BE CAUSING
A PSYCHOTIC BREAK

33:45.980 --> 33:47.155
INSTEAD OF CURING IT.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.375
IT'S GOING TO BE
EVERYONE'S PROBLEM

33:49.418 --> 33:51.029
IF ALICE FULLY
LOSES HER MIND

33:51.072 --> 33:53.118
BEFORE WE FINISH
THE JOB FOR MONTOYA.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.206
BUT

33:54.249 --> 33:55.685
HYPOTHETICALLY,

33:55.729 --> 33:58.166
I COULD GET A SUPERVISED

33:58.210 --> 33:59.950
WORK RELEASE FROM ARKHAM

33:59.994 --> 34:02.127
AND SWEET MARY COULD MAKE SURE

34:02.170 --> 34:03.606
I WAS TAKING MY PROPER MEDS.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.435
I'M SURE THAT RY-RY
COULD CONVINCE RENEE-NAY

34:06.479 --> 34:08.046
IT WAS FOR THE BEST.

34:08.089 --> 34:11.658
YOU KNOW, ALL FOR THE
SAKE OF FIGHTING CRIME.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.964
RIGHT. AND WHO'S
GONNA PUT UP WITH

34:14.008 --> 34:15.401
THAT BABY-SITTING JOB?

34:17.533 --> 34:19.796
SOMEONE WHO SLEEPS WITH
A GUN UNDER HER PILLOW.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.714
WHAT DO YOU
SAY? ROOMIES!

34:33.810 --> 34:34.811
HOW'S THE
OTHER CRISIS?

34:34.855 --> 34:36.117
RESOLVED.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.727
SO, YOU'LL BE
ONE-FOR-TWO TODAY.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.207
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE ME

34:39.251 --> 34:41.122
BEST PRACTICES
FOR A PERP WALK,

34:41.166 --> 34:43.081
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.083
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

34:45.126 --> 34:47.520
OH, I BELIEVE YOU.

34:47.563 --> 34:48.912
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ON
THE JOB LONG ENOUGH

34:48.956 --> 34:50.000
TO EMBEZZLE
A STAPLER,

34:50.044 --> 34:52.394
LET ALONE
$30 MILLION.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.396
I THINK YOU MADE
THE WRONG PERSON
YOUR ENEMY

34:54.440 --> 34:56.181
AND NOW YOU ARE
THE FALL GAL

34:56.224 --> 34:57.704
FOR BRUCE WAYNE'S
MISDEEDS.

34:58.835 --> 34:59.923
YOU THINK BRUCE WAYNE

34:59.967 --> 35:01.882
STOLE FROM
HIS OWN COMPANY?

35:01.925 --> 35:03.405
MR. WAYNE'S LEGACY

35:03.449 --> 35:04.928
HAS BEEN
COMPLICATED SINCE

35:04.972 --> 35:06.278
HE TOOK OVER
THE COMPANY.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.150
WITH HIS ADDICTIONS,
MISBEHAVIORS,

35:09.194 --> 35:11.021
AND DISAPPEARANCES,

35:11.065 --> 35:12.240
LET'S JUST SAY

35:12.284 --> 35:14.112
I'M USED TO
THE CHALLENGE OF

35:14.155 --> 35:15.635
PUTTING LIPSTICK
ON A PIG.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.552
WHAT'S THIS?

35:19.595 --> 35:20.770
PRESS RELEASE
THAT WILL GO OUT

35:20.814 --> 35:21.815
IN THE MORNING.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.251
AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW,

35:23.295 --> 35:24.731
IT WAS DETERMINED
THAT THE MISSING MONEY

35:24.774 --> 35:26.472
WAS PART OF A TOP-SECRET
DEFENSE CONTRACT

35:26.515 --> 35:28.648
THAT YOU NEGOTIATED
WITH ARGUS.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.650
CEO WILDER THOUGHT NO ONE
COULD KNOW ABOUT THIS

35:30.693 --> 35:32.173
FOR NATIONAL
SECURITY REASONS,

35:32.217 --> 35:34.436
AND DEEPLY REGRETS
NOT ALERTING

35:34.480 --> 35:35.872
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.310
ARGUS IS GONNA
GO ALONG WITH THIS STORY?

35:38.353 --> 35:39.441
I HAVE
AN OLD FRIEND THERE.

35:39.485 --> 35:40.747
HE'S DOING ME A FAVOR.

35:42.009 --> 35:45.317
OK. THAT'S IT?
CRISIS AVERTED?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.753
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.886
THE STOCK PRICE
IS STILL CRATERING

35:49.930 --> 35:51.540
BECAUSE SOMEONE

35:51.584 --> 35:52.976
IS COORDINATING A CAMPAIGN

35:53.020 --> 35:54.891
TO UNDERMINE
SHAREHOLDER CONFIDENCE.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.284
IF WE DON'T
DO SOMETHING

35:56.328 --> 35:57.938
TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE,
WE ARE AT RISK

35:57.981 --> 35:59.896
OF A HOSTILE TAKEOVER.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.246
THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS IS

36:01.289 --> 36:02.769
DEMANDING YOUR RESIGNATION.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.640
IT IS THE BEST SHOT
WE HAVE

36:04.684 --> 36:06.294
AT CONTAINING THE CRISIS.

36:08.688 --> 36:09.863
OK, CHARLIE.

36:11.343 --> 36:12.822
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD DO?

36:14.607 --> 36:16.304
THAT'S UP TO YOU,
MS. WILDER.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.094
BUT IN MY OPINION,

36:24.138 --> 36:25.270
IF YOU REMAIN AS CEO,

36:25.313 --> 36:26.749
WE WILL LOSE
THE COMPANY.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.671
WELL, WE KNEW SHE WAS
CAPABLE OF THIS.

36:35.715 --> 36:39.849
DID WE? BECAUSE
I'M NOT EVEN CLEAR

36:39.893 --> 36:43.070
WHY THE WOMAN
HATES ME SO DAMN MUCH.
I'M HER DAUGHTER!

36:43.113 --> 36:45.507
AND I TOLD YOU
THAT DOES NOT
MATTER TO HER.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.686
OK, LOOK.

36:52.427 --> 36:56.039
BRUCE WAS THE FACE
OF WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.693
BUT MY DAD
WAS HIS PARTNER.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.217
AND BRUCE WOULD
ALWAYS SAY THAT

36:59.260 --> 37:00.218
THE COMPANY
BELONGED TO LUCIUS

37:00.261 --> 37:01.610
AS MUCH AS IT DID HIM.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.223
RYAN, I CANNOT
LOSE THIS PLACE.

37:05.266 --> 37:06.572
YOU THINK I CAN?

37:08.835 --> 37:11.098
WHAT HAPPENS TO BATWOMAN
IF THERE'S NO CASH

37:11.141 --> 37:12.752
TO PUT GAS
IN THE BATMOBILE?

37:13.796 --> 37:17.278
I AM NOT LETTING
JADA TAKE MY CALLING.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.758
SO, WHAT?
SO, EVEN THOUGH

37:18.801 --> 37:20.063
NOBODY THINKS THAT
YOU'LL WIN,

37:20.107 --> 37:21.326
YOU'RE JUST GONNA...

37:22.457 --> 37:23.850
STAY AND FIGHT?

37:25.286 --> 37:26.592
HAVE YOU MET ME?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.640
OK.

37:31.684 --> 37:36.428
FAILSAFE SUBROUTINE...
REACTIVATED.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.039
NOW LET'S POWER CYCLE
THE BOOT LOADER.

37:39.082 --> 37:42.260
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, SON.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.478
DAD?

37:44.958 --> 37:46.438
OH, MY GOD. UM...

37:47.787 --> 37:50.093
I REALLY NEEDED
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.704
SO, THE COMPANY'S
UNDER ATTACK

37:51.747 --> 37:54.315
AND I FEEL LIKE IF
WE LOSE WAYNE ENTERPRISES,

37:54.359 --> 37:55.360
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
PIECE OF YOU THAT'S

37:55.403 --> 37:56.448
GONE FROM MY LIFE.

37:56.491 --> 37:57.666
HELPING WAYNE ENTERPRISES

37:57.710 --> 37:58.972
IS BEYOND THE SCOPE

37:59.015 --> 38:00.234
OF WHAT I CAN HELP WITH.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.496
YEAH. I KNOW.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.106
WE'RE ALREADY
MAKING A PLAN.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.282
I JUST--I NEEDED TO KNOW

38:04.325 --> 38:05.370
WHY YOU STOPPED
TALKING TO ME.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.936
YOU REPAIRED THE SYSTEM

38:06.980 --> 38:08.286
FAULT IN THE O.S.

38:08.329 --> 38:09.939
THAT HAD BEEN
BLOCKING THIS A.I.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.376
FROM NORMAL OPERATION.

38:11.419 --> 38:12.594
I DIDN'T REPAIR ANYTHING.
I JUST

38:12.638 --> 38:13.813
TURNED THE FAILSAFE
BACK ON.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.336
LUCAS, THIS A.I.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.598
IS NOT DESIGNED TO RUN

38:16.642 --> 38:18.426
INDEPENDENT OF
THE FAILSAFE.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.601
IT HAS NO PURPOSE

38:19.645 --> 38:21.255
IF IT'S NOT
EMPOWERED TO ACT

38:21.299 --> 38:22.778
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.737
RIGHT. OK, SO,

38:24.780 --> 38:26.782
ONCE A DAD, ALWAYS A DAD.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.959
WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO ASK ME?

38:30.003 --> 38:31.918
WELL, A FRIEND OF MINE

38:31.961 --> 38:34.442
KIND OF ALREADY
GAVE ME THE ANSWER, BUT...

38:36.879 --> 38:38.707
I NEED TO HEAR IT
FROM THE MAN HIMSELF.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.797
UM...

38:48.456 --> 38:52.286
I'M NOT READY TO WEAR
THE SUIT, AM I?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.594
NO, SON.
YOU'RE NOT.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.996
SO, WHY'D YOU HAVE ME
MEET YOU HERE?

39:07.040 --> 39:08.476
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE?

39:09.782 --> 39:13.351
JADA WANTS WAYNE
ENTERPRISES, DOESN'T SHE?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.657
LOOK...I'M SORRY

39:15.701 --> 39:17.050
YOU HAD TO FACE
JADA'S WRATH,

39:17.093 --> 39:19.531
AND THAT I HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THAT,

39:19.574 --> 39:21.489
BUT SHE'S HAD ME SIGN

39:21.533 --> 39:23.230
A THOUSAND NDAs
OVER THE YEARS,

39:23.273 --> 39:24.666
SO, CAN'T REALLY
TALK ABOUT

39:24.710 --> 39:26.102
COMPANY BUSINESS.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.190
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SIBLINGS

39:27.234 --> 39:28.627
HAVING EACH
OTHER'S BACKS?

39:30.193 --> 39:32.674
WHAT HAPPENED WAS YOU
WEREN'T INTERESTED.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.763
I AM NOT LETTING OUR MOM

39:34.807 --> 39:41.379
TAKE OVER
WAYNE ENTERPRISES.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.597
DO YOU THINK
THE TWO OF US

39:42.641 --> 39:44.904
COULD STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST JADA?

39:44.947 --> 39:46.906
IF WE PLEDGED
TO WORK TOGETHER.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.043
IT'S DEADLINE DAY,
MY FRIEND.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.088
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

39:56.568 --> 39:58.874
I HAVE THE ANSWER
YOU'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.540
AND IT WORKS
THE WAY I ASKED?

40:12.584 --> 40:15.064
IT WASN'T AN EASY PROCESS,
BUT YES.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.676
WE WERE ABLE TO ADAPT
VICTOR FRIES' RESEARCH

40:17.719 --> 40:19.547
INTO A NEW FORMULA

40:19.591 --> 40:22.289
THAT CAN SAFELY
FREEZE AND UNFREEZE

40:22.332 --> 40:24.465
ORGANIC MATERIAL.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.598
WHAT MADE THE PROCESS
SO DIFFICULT?

40:28.904 --> 40:31.211
OUR ARRANGEMENT IS
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY

40:31.254 --> 40:33.561
COMMISSIONS US TO
ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.345
BUT OUR TERMS
WERE NON-NEGOTIABLE.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.739
YOU DO NOT INQUIRE
ABOUT OUR METHODS,

40:37.783 --> 40:39.611
NOR OUR IDENTITIES.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.788
YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT LINES YOU CROSS

40:42.831 --> 40:44.616
TO "ACHIEVE
THE IMPOSSIBLE."

40:46.487 --> 40:48.576
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT LINE I CROSSED?

40:49.969 --> 40:51.492
THE FINAL BREAKTHROUGH
CAME FROM

40:51.536 --> 40:53.233
A RIVAL RESEARCH TEAM.

40:54.364 --> 40:55.757
I STOLE THEIR IDEA.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.500
AS LONG AS THAT'S
THE EXTENT OF IT,

40:59.544 --> 41:01.763
I'M A VERY
HAPPY CUSTOMER.

41:01.807 --> 41:02.764
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A LITTLE

41:02.808 --> 41:04.592
CORPORATE ESPIONAGE.

41:04.636 --> 41:07.465
SO. NOW THAT YOU
HAVE THE ABILITY

41:07.508 --> 41:11.512
TO PUT ANYONE'S LIFE
ON PAUSE INDEFINITELY,

41:11.556 --> 41:12.644
YOU JUST GIVE ME
THE WORD

41:12.687 --> 41:15.037
AND I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.125
OH, I WILL.

41:17.126 --> 41:18.693
AND IT WON'T BE
A LONG WAIT.

41:20.129 --> 41:22.871
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR MY SON MARQUIS

41:22.915 --> 41:24.873
TO TAKE HIS
LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

41:51.683 --> 41:53.336
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
