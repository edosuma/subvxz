02:02.788 --> 02:04.665
You think Dr. Crest is right?

02:04.957 --> 02:07.627
You think this operation
will make Harvey okay again?

02:07.793 --> 02:09.045
I don't know.

02:10.546 --> 02:12.548
We can only hope.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.729
Give me that file.

02:31.942 --> 02:33.402
- I'II get him.
- Look out, Harvey!

02:41.952 --> 02:43.412
Harvey!

02:51.212 --> 02:52.546
Harvey.

02:53.297 --> 02:55.007
No-

03:10.940 --> 03:13.484
Your bad side
is almost completely submerged.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.195
You've done very well
in therapy, Harvey.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.239
You're more in control now,

03:18.406 --> 03:22.243
able to make decisions for yourself
without relying on chance.

03:22.451 --> 03:24.870
Now it's time for the final step,

03:25.287 --> 03:28.290
erasing the scars that created Two-Face.

03:28.457 --> 03:31.127
I believe that once you are whole again,

03:31.293 --> 03:35.715
your mind will be strong enough
to banish Two-Face permanently.

03:35.881 --> 03:39.510
- Bruce Wayne picked up the tab for this?
- Yes.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.971
Good old Bruce.
He's never given up on me.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.849
Always been my best friend.

03:45.474 --> 03:49.478
I remember when we used to close
the town at the Half Moon Club.

03:49.645 --> 03:51.397
Most fun we ever had.

03:52.356 --> 03:54.567
Heard they were tearing
the old place down.

03:55.192 --> 03:58.279
I guess nothing good lasts forever.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.032
He's ready. Let's do it.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.752
No! What are you doing?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.003
Stop!

04:21.635 --> 04:22.636
Come on!

04:24.472 --> 04:26.849
Sorry, his insurance
don't cover this.

04:30.978 --> 04:33.689
Don't hurt him.
Boss wants to handle Dent personally.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.608
Said he wants to teach him some respect.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.320
Take a load off.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.863
Ow!

04:57.630 --> 05:00.007
Man, talk about malpractice.

05:05.846 --> 05:07.681
Hey. Slow down.

05:10.684 --> 05:13.729
You take the sedan.
I'll go after the other one.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.089
Clean your windshield, mister?

06:02.486 --> 06:03.654
Hmm.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.701
Scratch one bat.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.837
The van was registered to Rupert Thorne.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.506
But Harvey was in the sedan.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.257
It was headed for Stonegate.

07:47.549 --> 07:49.259
The Penguin's in Stonegate.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.762
He's had a grudge
against Two-Face for a while now.

07:52.012 --> 07:53.722
Maybe this is his revenge.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.516
Sorry I wasn't able to stop them.

07:56.183 --> 07:57.893
I'm sure you did your best.

07:58.185 --> 08:01.146
Don't gush all over me.
It's embarrassing.

08:08.195 --> 08:11.407
Sorry. Harvey's my friend.
I'm worried about him.

08:11.573 --> 08:14.326
Right, and I'm just the kid in tights.

08:14.910 --> 08:17.287
I'll see you
after I've checked out Thorne.

08:30.259 --> 08:34.054
<i>[remember when we used
to close the town at the Half Moon Club.</i>

08:34.346 --> 08:36.849
<i>Most fun we ever had.</i>

09:02.958 --> 09:05.335
May I help you?

09:20.267 --> 09:24.063
Frankie here says they found you
snooping around my roof. Why?

09:24.229 --> 09:27.900
- What are you trying to find?
- Not "what," Thorne, "who."

09:28.317 --> 09:31.320
Somebody grabbed Harvey Dent
out of Gotham Central Hospital.

09:33.572 --> 09:36.158
Somebody nabbed Two-Face,
and you thought I did it?

09:36.241 --> 09:38.535
That's great.

09:38.702 --> 09:41.288
I wish. I really hate that guy.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.207
He tried to put me out of business.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.250
I've been planning what I'd do

09:45.417 --> 09:48.170
if I ever got my hands on him again,
and I'll tell you-

09:48.378 --> 09:51.090
No, better yet, as long as you're here,

09:51.298 --> 09:52.424
I'll show you.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.678
Boys, take the Boy Wonder here
down to Gotham Gate Bridge

09:56.929 --> 09:59.056
and see how well he flies.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.101
Thanks for giving an old man
a good laugh, kid.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.812
Nice knowing you.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.643
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to fish around here.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.229
Can't do it anymore.

10:47.396 --> 10:50.232
Know why? Too much garbage.

10:50.315 --> 10:52.734
You wouldn't believe the stuff
people toss in the river.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.070
It's disgusting.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.624
People today got no respect
for Mother Nature.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.085
Sooner or later, just you wait.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.211
They'll be sorry.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.891
Not all the garbage is in the river.

11:36.653 --> 11:38.363
Dance, my little ones.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.532
Dance for Penguin.

11:44.953 --> 11:46.330
Excellent.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.665
A terpsichorean triumph.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.170
And what might you be doing out there?

11:53.503 --> 11:55.214
Catching insects for dinner?

11:55.547 --> 11:57.257
I'm looking for Two-Face.

11:57.507 --> 12:00.677
Why? Did you lose him?

12:00.761 --> 12:03.722
Somebody kidnapped him
from Gotham Central tonight.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.433
You and he had a disagreement
some time ago.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.435
- Didn't you?
- It's true.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.313
Harvey stole a rare <i>avis</i>
right out from under my beak

12:11.396 --> 12:12.564
several months ago.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.943
A jewel-encrusted statuette
of a two-headed roc.

12:16.151 --> 12:17.778
It was worth millions.

12:18.028 --> 12:22.908
But, my dear rodent, I'd never kidnap
a fellow rogue out of a sickbed.

12:23.116 --> 12:24.868
It just isn't done.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.704
- Honor among thieves?
- Absolutely.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.165
If I were going to attack Harvey,
I'd do it

12:30.249 --> 12:34.044
face-to-face, to-face. So to speak.

12:34.294 --> 12:35.921
Like this!

12:57.818 --> 12:59.569
Over here, you fools.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.489
He's down there. Down there.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.382
Any luck with Thorne?

13:20.799 --> 13:22.426
Thorne didn't kidnap Harvey.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.011
Neither did the Penguin.

13:24.219 --> 13:26.430
But I think I know who did.

13:44.906 --> 13:46.950
Doctors and nurses working in the QR.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.202
Wear paper socks over their shoes,

13:49.453 --> 13:52.456
so this footprint had to be made
by one of the kidnappers.

13:53.081 --> 13:54.875
Masonry dust.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.127
I know where to find him now.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.546
Find who? Who did this?

13:59.796 --> 14:01.757
Harvey's worst enemy.

14:01.965 --> 14:03.425
I'll take it from here.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.469
Wait a second. You might need me.

14:05.886 --> 14:06.970
Not this time, Robin.

14:07.262 --> 14:09.473
This is something I have to do alone.

14:29.993 --> 14:32.454
You may as well come out.

14:32.954 --> 14:34.664
I know everything now.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.552
You hated Harvey Dent

14:47.886 --> 14:50.180
and would do anything to destroy him.

14:51.139 --> 14:52.349
Why not?

14:52.557 --> 14:54.476
He was gonna destroy me,

14:54.726 --> 14:57.354
just like I'm gonna destroy you.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.904
You kidnapped yourself.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.781
I should've seen it right away.

15:49.990 --> 15:53.201
One red herring clue wasn't enough.
You had to leave two.

15:53.368 --> 15:56.538
I couldn't let that wimp
Dent destroy me.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.875
I had to teach the little man
some respect.

16:00.208 --> 16:03.670
Everybody needs respect.

16:03.753 --> 16:05.505
You're your own worst enemy, Harvey.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.551
No. I'm your worst enemy.

16:09.801 --> 16:10.886
See this?

16:11.178 --> 16:14.431
It's the remote control
for that detonator.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.143
Once my boys and I
get down to the ground,

16:18.351 --> 16:20.854
I'll use it to set off that dynamite.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.358
Unless, of course,
the coin says different.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.694
What do you say, Batman?

16:28.069 --> 16:30.238
Feefinglucky?

16:30.989 --> 16:33.325
Looks like I don't have
much choice.

16:36.536 --> 16:37.662
Let it hit the floor.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.080
I wanna see it.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.377
That can't happen.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.137
No. It isn't possible.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.349
It can't land on edge.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.226
It has to be heads or tails.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.103
How can I decide
if it isn't heads or tails?

17:12.447 --> 17:14.241
On edge, it's still on edge.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.605
Heads or tails. I have to know.

17:45.689 --> 17:46.982
Heads or tails.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.913
Harvey. Pull yourself up.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.333
I can't. I'II drop the coin.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.793
Drop it. Save yourself.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.837
I... I don't know what to do.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.339
The coin won't tell me.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.299
It can't tell you anything.

18:54.382 --> 18:56.801
I switched coins when you grabbed me.

19:01.973 --> 19:04.726
Good thing I decided to tag along
after all.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.854
It's a trick coin.

19:07.937 --> 19:09.773
It'll always land on edge.

19:09.856 --> 19:11.983
It's your decision now, Harvey.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.777
Life or death.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.571
The coin or me.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.091
Batman, help me.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.471
Never.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.974
Harvey!

20:15.004 --> 20:17.799
Bruce. Good old Bruce.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.634
Always there.

20:19.926 --> 20:21.302
You never give up on me.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.642
He's right.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.936
- You're always there for him.
- Yes.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.313
Just like you're always there for me.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.275
Hey, what are friends for?

21:10.018 --> 21:11.060
