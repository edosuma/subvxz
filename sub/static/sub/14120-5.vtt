So, Alex, why do you think
your dad should be

03:17.998 --> 03:19.231
Well, he's 96.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.333
He lives alone in a cabin
up in the mountains.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.101
There's no heat.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.937
So he has to chop wood
just to keep from
freezing to death.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.139
I mean, he always forgets
to take his heart medicine.

03:27.141 --> 03:30.008
And the nearest hospital,
it's two hours away.

a little crazy,
but I swear to God,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.546
he's getting crazier
every day.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.881
Is he single?

(CHUCKLING)

03:39.586 --> 03:41.620
Mmm, Alex,
it's a tough situation,

03:41.622 --> 03:43.422
but I think you're right.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.425
You should definitely put
your father in a nursing home.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.805
He needs his independence.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.040
You take that away from him
and he'll have nothing
to live for.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.276
Elsa.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.712
It's a tough situation,

04:09.817 --> 04:11.783
No ifs, ands, and buts.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.454
Fine. Then we'll have Dad
move in with you.

04:15.456 --> 04:18.523
Oh, because with three kids
and a marriage that's
hanging on by a thread,

04:18.525 --> 04:19.891
I don't have enough
on my plate?

04:19.893 --> 04:22.227

04:29.803 --> 04:32.537
It's timing.
You've got bad timing.

04:32.539 --> 04:36.074
If anything, it makes
the most sense for him
to live with you, Alex.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.509
You live alone.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.077
And I travel all the time,

04:39.079 --> 04:41.413
so he'd still have
no one looking after him.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.948
Hey, I have a solution.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.850
I think your father
should move in with us.

-Dad!

04:47.554 --> 04:49.288
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what we need.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.157
That's what the team
has been missing
the entire time,

04:52.159 --> 04:54.092
a 96-year-old man.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.461

05:08.208 --> 05:10.776
Well, have you asked
your father what he wants?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.678
He doesn't know
what's good for him.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.845
And he's crazy.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.981
He's not crazy,
he's eccentric.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.016
He spends all his time
up there

05:18.018 --> 05:20.452
looking for
the Abominable Snowman.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.853

05:21.855 --> 05:24.723
(SIGHS) Maybe you're right.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.191

He's still not picking up.

you talked to him?

-It's been a few days.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.366
Can you seriously
not move your seat up?

06:07.368 --> 06:09.134
I told you,
I can't reach the handle.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.603
It's not my fault Alex didn't
spring for power seats.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.840
(SCOFFS)
Why is the smallest person
sitting up there anyway?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.208
He called shotgun.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.577
And when you call shotgun,
you get shotgun.

06:18.579 --> 06:22.180
Does anyone know where
the term "Riding shotgun"
comes from?

06:24.617 --> 06:26.785
Okay. Well, I'll tell you.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.387
MARQUESS: It comes
from the Old West.

06:28.389 --> 06:30.789
When the settlers were riding
in their covered wagons,

06:30.791 --> 06:34.893
they always had someone
sit up next to the driver
holding a shotgun.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.028
Yeah, to protect them
from bandits.

06:37.030 --> 06:41.767
And that is where the term
"Shotgun" comes from.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.870
Really? It's not from me
wanting to put a shotgun
in my mouth

06:44.872 --> 06:46.438
while you were
telling that story?

There, there. It's okay.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.701
At least now
you don't have to decide

07:16.703 --> 07:18.370
if your dad
should live with you,

07:18.372 --> 07:20.939
or if he should be
put into a nursing home.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.308
Because he's dead.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.210
And so, now,
all you have to decide now is

07:25.212 --> 07:27.412
what you're gonna do
with his frozen body.

freezing to death

07:43.263 --> 07:45.964
is one of the most
painless ways to go.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.370
Or maybe it's one of the most
painful ways to go.

07:52.372 --> 07:56.007

it was excruciating.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.008

08:30.010 --> 08:32.077

there are worse things

Your dad was crazy, all right.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.879
But not because he believes
in the Abominable Snowman.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.283
No, it's because he wanted to
exterminate the Jewish people,

09:11.285 --> 09:13.952
which, if you ask me,
I believe is
much more abominable

09:13.954 --> 09:15.887

You know, I was good
at really balancing myself.

and as soon as
I came down the hill,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.416
I hit the concrete.

hit the concrete,

it stops and you keep going.

happened to me.
