00:02.252 --> 00:06.041
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.215 --> 00:09.253
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.256
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:15.009
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:17.131
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.309 --> 00:19.972
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.229 --> 00:23.518
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.690
<i>and I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:28.276
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:30.854
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.948 --> 00:33.406
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.324
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.698
They identified the target
sooner than we planned.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.570
Perhaps.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.624
There's nothing within miles of here
capable of even creating dark matter.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.916
There was three weeks ago.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.705
<i>This is where I came
out of the Speed Force.</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:49.415
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.833
You think the guy
behind the Samurai robots...

00:51.927 --> 00:52.963
Samuroid.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.760
He wanted us to create
a busload of metas.

00:54.846 --> 00:55.962
I think it's all connected.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.427
Hello, gorgeous.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.470
<i>You ready to get your schmoopy on?</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:03.014
Joe, I'm pregnant.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.147
Look, I was thinking.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.528
No, no, less thinking, more kissing.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.070
Okay, but hold on a minute.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.746
This thing we got going on,
this is real good.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.957
- It's okay.
- What?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.625
I'm just kidding, it's better than okay.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.248
Yeah, that's right,
it's better than okay.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.502
And because of that, I think
we're at a place in our relationship

01:31.633 --> 01:35.252
where the guy says to his girl,
those three magic words.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.258
What three words?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.432
What's your name?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.727
Um... Oh.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.396
Well, that is technically four words.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.269
Actually, technically, it's three words

01:49.359 --> 01:51.021
'cause contractions are one word,
it's how grammar works.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.525
That's not the point, though.
What's your name?

01:55.449 --> 01:57.486
Gypsy. My name is Gypsy.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.614
For real? You were born and somebody
was like, "I'm gonna name you Gypsy"?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.696
Gypsy is what I like to be called.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.826
It is mysterious and it's moody.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.578
Hmm. Moody's right.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.658
All right.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.203
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
and when I get back,

02:10.297 --> 02:12.289
you better stop asking me my real name.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.506
And be wearing less clothes.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.002
I don't need to know your name.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.637
<i>This girl
She 'bout to rock your world</i>

02:29.858 --> 02:31.065
You're a dead man.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.983
Those were collectibles!

02:49.586 --> 02:50.793
Who are you?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.621
Daddy!

02:55.509 --> 02:56.750
Pleased to meet you, sir.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.754
Is he gonna put me down?

03:06.269 --> 03:10.138
You know, some of you may not realize,
but before I was mayor,

03:10.232 --> 03:12.394
I was a cop in this very precinct.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.231
And it's because of these men and women,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.904
every family in Central City
can sleep comfortably at night.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.106
What's happening?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.942
Mayor Bellows is on his
reelection campaign.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.195
...Detective Joe West.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.575
Keep up the good work.
What do you say, Joe?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.086
I'll do that.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.960
And that's why he's not a politician.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.503
I hate that.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.585
Yeah? How about running against him?

03:40.679 --> 03:43.046
Can you picture yourself
shaking hands and kissing babies?

03:43.140 --> 03:44.130
What?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.261
- Ain't nobody talking about babies.
- I was...

03:46.351 --> 03:49.344
You said you had a lead
on this meta bus situation.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.804
Yeah, I do.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.559
<i>Bellow for Bellows!</i>

03:55.610 --> 03:57.272
You took the photos down
from your mother's case.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.695
Yeah, well, the case was solved.
This one isn't.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.857
<i>We got these two, Kilg%re and Hazard.</i>

04:02.033 --> 04:03.319
But that still leaves 10 meta-humans

04:03.410 --> 04:05.367
that were created
when I came out of the Speed Force.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.288
How hard can it be to track down
ten bus passengers?

04:08.373 --> 04:11.491
Well, according to
the Department of Transportation,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.952
over 900 people rode that bus that day.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.081
What about the bus driver?

04:15.464 --> 04:16.875
That's where things
get more interesting.

04:16.964 --> 04:20.048
He's dead. Drowned. In his own bathtub.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.801
That's not too suspicious.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.970
Harry said it was all connected,
I think he's right.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.889
The Samuroid pushing you guys
to bring me back,

04:26.975 --> 04:29.262
and me not coming out at the place
that you thought I would,

04:29.352 --> 04:32.845
the bus being at the exact right place
to be hit by dark matter...

04:32.981 --> 04:35.815
- It was planned.
- Yeah, by somebody smart.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.651
- We're pretty smart.
- Well, I think so.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.400
Okay, let's look closer
into the bus driver's death,

04:41.490 --> 04:42.480
it may give us a lead.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.941
I'll have Iris pull up the autopsy
report from the coroner's office.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.950
Sounds good.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.820
What?

04:49.915 --> 04:53.124
I don't know, this morning,
you're like...

04:53.877 --> 04:55.084
Glowing.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.665
What do you mean, "glowing"?

04:57.756 --> 04:58.746
I just mean, like,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.878
you got like a warmth about you,
like a Lite-Brite.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.386
There's no warmth, no glow,
and I ain't no damn Lite-Brite.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.963
You're wasting time. S.T.A.R. Labs.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.674
Glowing and irritable.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.096
How's Cecile?

05:15.190 --> 05:18.934
Fine. Same. I mean, nothing's changed.
If something changes, I'll let you know.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.358
All right.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.575
This facility is poorly guarded.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.401
Clearly.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.538
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

05:32.624 --> 05:35.458
Okay, power down, Buckaroo.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.160
Good. You're both here.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.290
Cisco, who is this?

05:38.547 --> 05:42.166
This is Breacher, AKA Gypsy's father.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.591
Oh.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.261
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.054
There is no resemblance.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.508
So, you know how Gypsy's kind of
a big deal collector on Earth-19?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.764
Well, her boss is her dad.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.439
Who decided to pay us
a surprise visit at the <i>perfect</i> time,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.983
which is why I decided
to show him around,

06:01.069 --> 06:02.059
where I work, you know.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.439
I'm Barry Allen.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.112
Cisco's personal assistant.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.230
His what?

06:06.324 --> 06:09.032
And he is the best personal assistant
I've ever had,

06:09.119 --> 06:10.405
stays late, starts early.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.532
- One day, I'll be working for him.
- What are you doing?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.488
I wanted to impress him,
and now, I can't stop.

06:14.916 --> 06:15.906
Joe West.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.912
A fellow law man.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.710
You, I can respect.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.163
And Harry Wells, back there.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.299
You look like someone I once sent
my daughter to kill.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.255
I get that a lot.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.263
I thought maybe someone would
want to give him the old look-see.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.217
Great idea, Allen, Detective West,

06:34.311 --> 06:37.770
why don't you give Gypsy's father here
the nickel tour of the facilities?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.179
Joe.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.600
I've had to pee for, like, three hours.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.106
- What is wrong with you?
- Have you seen his face.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.819
The guy's killed people with that face.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.993
I'm not even joking.
Gypsy said that literally happened.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.694
- You want his approval, right?
- Yes, I want his approval.

06:53.788 --> 06:54.778
He's my girlfriend's father.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.034
Of course, Cisco, listen,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.707
you're a fine upstanding, smart,
well-groomed young man.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.911
Any father would be happy to have
you date his daughter except me.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.454
Can't date my daughter, right?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.039
Can't date Jesse, Jesse's off-limits.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.749
Went for the compliment,
didn't stick the landing.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.460
Just take him for coffee, okay?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.386
Go for coffee,
get to know him a little bit better.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.760
I bet
that you'll be pleasantly surprised

07:13.850 --> 07:15.057
at how much you have in common, right?

07:15.226 --> 07:16.967
You both have the same powers,
you're breachers,

07:17.062 --> 07:18.644
you have ridiculous hair,
he has ridiculous hair.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.643
- Okay, but...
- And you both love Gypsy.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.143
Are you actually giving me
decent relationship advice right now?

07:25.236 --> 07:26.727
I am. You'll be fine.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.816
I don't want to be here anymore.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.616
And we're leaving.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.283
- Help me.
- Have fun storming the castle.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.451
Why is the scariest person
I have ever seen roaming our halls?

07:41.544 --> 07:42.534
Cisco.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.001
Okay, so, I've got the coroner's report
for the death of the bus driver,

07:46.091 --> 07:49.050
but it doesn't seem like
there's any signs of foul play.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.376
Aside for him being the one guy

07:50.470 --> 07:52.052
that could've told us
who else was on that bus.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.471
They logged his personal effects,
let's see.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.674
Credit cards, cash, receipts. Um...

07:57.102 --> 07:58.092
Wait, go back.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.520
- Ralph Dibny.
- I'll be damned.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.310
<i>Who is Ralph Dibny?</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:08.523
He used to be a cop.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.234
Dirty cop. Got kicked off the force.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.440
- For what?
- It's a long story.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.323
- That's him.
<i>- Oh.</i>

08:17.414 --> 08:20.498
He's handsome in a square-jawed,
Oliver Queen kind of way.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.573
For real?

08:21.668 --> 08:23.876
Babe, you know
I've only got eyes for you.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.206
The IOU is dated the same day
that I came out of the Speed Force.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.292
You think Dibny was on the bus that day?
Maybe he's a meta-human now?

08:31.386 --> 08:32.547
Let's pay him a visit.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.337
Hey, you seem... Something.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.139
What's up with you and this Ralph guy?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.342
It's like Joe said, it's a long story.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.187
- Oliver Queen is hot.
- Amen and hallelujah.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.850
<i>I promised there wasn't
a single case I couldn't crack.</i>

08:49.070 --> 08:50.902
<i>And a promise made is a promise kept.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:54.106
Dibny detects.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.534
Your husband didn't die
in that plane crash, Mrs. Broome.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.986
He didn't? Then where is he?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.823
Well, that brings us
to the difficult part.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.617
Turns out he got remarried,
and moved to Minnesota.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.835
Has two kids now, twins.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.295
Twins in the Twin Cities.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.300
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey...

09:18.808 --> 09:21.972
No, don't... Don't cry for that jerk.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.853
He doesn't deserve it.
The sun still shines.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.851
The birds, they still chirp.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.937
Chirp, chirp.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.067
Mrs. Broome,
you are a very attractive woman,

09:33.156 --> 09:36.194
and you will find someone else.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.366
Someone who will hold you,

09:38.787 --> 09:41.530
someone who will wipe away those tears.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.165
Do you like shrimp?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.255
This is definitely his place.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.056
Reconsidered, huh?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.892
<i>- Ralph.</i>
- Joe West.

10:10.151 --> 10:14.020
Barry Allen. Been a long time, rookie.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.152
Well, I'm not a rookie anymore, Dibny.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.449
You look healthy.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.529
Yeah. Got the spare tire
out of the trunk. It happens.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.122
<i>Might even happen to you, too,
one day, Slim Jim.</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:28.291
So, what brings you boys
to <i>Casa de</i> Dibny?

10:28.378 --> 10:31.621
Were you on the 405 bus
four weeks ago, around noon?

10:31.923 --> 10:33.380
That's a very specific question.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.757
<i>We found your IOU</i>

10:34.843 --> 10:36.960
from the deceased
bus drivers' personal effects.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.089
"Deceased"?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.512
Hey. That's one less "U" I owe.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.256
What's it to you two?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.595
It's a simple question,
why don't you just answer it?

10:44.894 --> 10:48.604
You walk into my office after
five years like nothing ever happened,

10:48.690 --> 10:50.101
<i>and ask me for a favor?</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:52.350
I smell a mystery.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.943
It's not a favor, it's information.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.737
And how much is this information worth?

10:57.824 --> 10:58.985
Are you shaking us down?

11:00.827 --> 11:01.817
I know something you don't.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.116
And you need to know it badly.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.869
Otherwise, you'd never
swallow your pride and face me

11:07.959 --> 11:09.200
after what you did.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.785
After what I did?

11:10.879 --> 11:12.040
Ralph.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.498
The people on that bus were exposed
to a dangerous substance.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.790
"Dangerous"?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.672
Dangerous like what? Like... Ebola?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.222
Were you on the bus?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.258
No.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.093
Okay.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.307
Let's go.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.765
Hey, I heard you shacked up
with that hot DA. She got a sister?

11:34.736 --> 11:35.726
Okay.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.403
<i>Good luck. All the best.</i>

11:49.918 --> 11:51.204
So, what's it worth?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.127
Ah, crap.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.339
You don't wanna do this!
I know what you want!

12:01.429 --> 12:03.591
Let's talk about this! Put me down!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.473
Don't put me down! Don't put me down!

12:20.281 --> 12:23.149
- That guy hasn't changed a bit.
- You really expect him to?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.873
Guess he was on that bus.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.055
Hey, guys, what the hell?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.136
Yeah, yeah...

12:52.230 --> 12:53.266
What's happened to me?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.598
- Breathe, okay?
- I'm breathing.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.103
Clearly, this guy is a bus meta.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.776
This is interesting. The dark matter
polymerized Dibny's cells.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.230
What the hell is dark matter
and why is it in my cells?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.441
You're saying the walls of every cell
in his body have elasticized?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.618
It seems they formed an unbreakable
bond at an atomic level,

13:07.704 --> 13:09.445
and now, you can stretch these cells
and stretch these cells.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.201
- Like Silly Putty.
- Like Silly Putty.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.078
- I'm Silly Putty?
- No.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.745
- Kind of.
- I'm Silly Putty?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.914
Ralph, who were the guys on the roof?

13:17.005 --> 13:19.668
Is it really the issue right now?

13:19.757 --> 13:21.874
Look at me!

13:22.051 --> 13:25.340
Allen, you and your S.T.A.R. Labs
nerds better put me back together.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.887
- We're trying to help you.
- You're not trying to help me.

13:26.973 --> 13:27.963
Shut up! Oh, my God!

13:28.766 --> 13:30.223
- Give him a second!
- Look at him!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.517
- You're lucky, man. I would...
- Try me. Come on!

13:31.769 --> 13:34.386
You can do this later,
I just need a sample of blood.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.287
Oh... Is that my face?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.832
Four years seeing this stuff,
I finally puked.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.671
Can I plug in?

14:13.978 --> 14:14.968
Daddy.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.271
<i>I know you love me and I love you.</i>

14:17.357 --> 14:20.020
I really like Cisco,
and I need you two to get along.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.522
So, do you think
that you can try to do that?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.729
I'll do anything for you, petal.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.907
Ah! Three coffees.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.864
How about you, huh?
Ready for some hot java?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.950
We don't have coffee on my Earth.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.706
<i>Crops were destroyed,</i>

14:35.958 --> 14:38.416
my world was attacked, invaded,

14:38.628 --> 14:42.918
<i>by the worst,
most evil creatures in the multi-verse.</i>

14:43.508 --> 14:45.249
I'll never drink coffee again.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.713
- Two for me.
- It's okay.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.215
Daddy, why don't I get you a tea?

14:49.305 --> 14:50.637
- Like a relaxing tea?
- Yeah.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.555
- Please. Thanks.
- Okay.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.728
Ah...

14:58.523 --> 15:01.812
I know from a friend
who is also a father,

15:01.901 --> 15:04.109
how important his daughter is to him

15:04.195 --> 15:06.608
and I just wanted to let you know

15:06.697 --> 15:08.984
how important your daughter is to me.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.951
And that after you and I
get to know each other a little,

15:13.496 --> 15:15.362
maybe we might find that...

15:16.833 --> 15:18.119
We're not so different.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.993
I'm going to hunt you.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.416
You're not worthy of her.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.043
Isn't that for her to decide?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.256
Ten.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.886
Also, I could've sworn you said
you were gonna hunt me.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.213
What, like a deer?

15:32.473 --> 15:35.762
I've hunted some of the worst
breach criminals in history.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.559
Maaldor, the Darklord,
Solumga of the Sheeda,

15:40.940 --> 15:43.478
the Sand People of Quarrm.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.272
You will be easy prey.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.352
Nine.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.861
Listen, I have tried
to be polite with you,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.158
but this is going a little too far.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.906
I get that you're overprotective.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.862
- Eight.
- Are you counting?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.538
In the next 24 hours,

15:58.624 --> 16:00.866
I will be hunting you
throughout this city.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.084
We'll not use our powers,

16:03.171 --> 16:06.414
but when it's over,
my daughter will be free of you.

16:06.883 --> 16:07.873
Seven.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.424
Do you do this with all her boyfriends?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.418
I hunted her last one, yes.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.502
Where is he now?

16:12.597 --> 16:14.179
- I don't know.
- He got away.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.881
I don't know where you go when you die.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.305
- Five.
- You just skipped six.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.307
I know. Four.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.475
And don't try to breach.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.437
I'll know it if you do.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.397
You can't hide from me.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.899
So, if I were you...

16:30.490 --> 16:32.231
I would start running.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.444
Cisky.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.042
Three, two, one.

16:47.215 --> 16:50.049
Damn. He's hunting him.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.260
I finally calmed him down.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.717
It's amazing what 50 milligrams
of Lorazepam can do

16:59.810 --> 17:01.176
when you get it in aerosol form.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.307
Is there anything you can do
to put him back together?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.229
Please, my stomach can't take much more.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.104
I think I could stabilize his cells
if I had a sample of his DNA

17:08.194 --> 17:11.278
from prior to when he was exposed
to the dark matter on the bus.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.605
Why?

17:12.698 --> 17:16.863
So, he can go out and start hurting
people like our other friends here?

17:17.161 --> 17:19.743
I think we should lock him up
in the Pipeline.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.116
He hasn't done anything.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.321
Yet.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.875
Trust me, I know this guy.
He's a bad guy.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.330
Barry, I took an oath to help people.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.837
I'm a doctor. I can't just
leave him in there like spaghetti.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.501
"Villains"?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.002
Yeah.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.680
Every person that was on that bus
is now a thousand times

17:38.766 --> 17:40.348
more dangerous than they were before.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.424
Dibny included.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.135
- What if he's changed?
- People don't change.

17:43.229 --> 17:46.643
I did. When I became Killer Frost,
you still believed in me.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.018
You're a good person.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.099
He's...

17:50.278 --> 17:51.268
Not.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.854
Barry, how about you and I
go to Dibny's office,

17:53.948 --> 17:55.530
find a DNA sample for Caitlin?

17:55.616 --> 17:58.700
<i>Dad, you go back to CCPD,
see what you can dig up on Dibny.</i>

17:58.786 --> 17:59.993
Yes, boss.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.704
Looks like someone tossed this place.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.788
Yeah.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.374
Probably the same guys
that hung Dibny off the roof.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.629
<i>Why do you think?</i>

18:15.928 --> 18:17.385
I don't know, guy like that,

18:17.471 --> 18:20.259
probably has a long list of people
that want to toss him off rooftops.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.891
Why do you want to?

18:23.394 --> 18:26.933
No, seriously.
What happened between the two of you?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.938
It was one of my first cases
when I was a junior CSI.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.190
Dibny was the lead detective.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.112
What case?

18:37.074 --> 18:39.487
A woman named Judy Gimlin
was stabbed to death.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.739
<i>Her husband, Reagan,
was the prime suspect.</i>

18:43.247 --> 18:44.579
But there was no evidence.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.873
Nothing to tie him to the crime scene.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.660
And then, Dibny

18:50.129 --> 18:53.338
miraculously found a knife
with the husband's fingerprints.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.461
<i>Case closed. Dibny was a hero.</i>

18:56.761 --> 18:59.845
I don't know, maybe because my mom
was stabbed, I wanted to be sure.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.341
<i>So, I analyzed the knife.</i>

19:01.432 --> 19:04.140
The serrations on the blade
did not match the wound on the vic.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.434
So, Dibny planted the knife.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.510
Yeah.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.313
And then he lied about it, under oath.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.560
And you busted him?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.187
I mean,
he didn't just bend the rules, Iris,

19:13.277 --> 19:15.644
he committed perjury,
evidence tampering.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.774
He was thrown off the force.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.281
Point is, he was crooked then,
he's crooked now.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.327
Hey, how much DNA
do you think Caitlin needs?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.497
Not much.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.033
Okay.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.249
Oh... Think this'll work?

19:33.506 --> 19:34.587
Hmm.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.126
Barry!

19:47.561 --> 19:49.769
I guess someone hates him
more than you do.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.737
And that's what it feels like
to vibrate through solid matter.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.031
I'm just glad that you two weren't hurt.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.949
No thanks to your new buddy in there.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.526
He's not my buddy, he's my patient.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.361
Caitlin, I just don't understand
why you're defending him.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.162
Because I know what it's like
to suddenly find yourself

20:08.249 --> 20:11.117
with extraordinary powers
and be totally freaked out by it.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.247
And so do you, for that matter.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.503
You and I both woke up in this lab once

20:15.673 --> 20:17.585
<i>knowing that our lives
would never be the same.</i>

20:17.675 --> 20:19.632
<i>So, how about you give the guy
a little sympathy?</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:21.255
- Hey.
- Guys.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.086
I pulled the LUDS on Dibny's phone,

20:23.180 --> 20:26.844
there were 15 phone calls
between him and the mayor's office.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.059
What is Mayor Bellows doing
talking to Ralph Dibny?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.064
Look, it's my good buddy, Barry Allen.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.437
Someone just blew up your office.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.607
Sweet. Insurance claim.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.233
My fiancée and I almost died.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.658
You landed West's daughter?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.111
- Well...
- Wow.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.411
Everything's coming up Allen.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.829
The job, the girl.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.531
Who's trying to kill you, Dibny?

20:51.625 --> 20:52.786
Do you know how many people

20:52.877 --> 20:54.960
I have pissed off
in the last five years?

20:55.045 --> 20:56.707
<i>Angry husbands, angry wives.</i>

20:56.797 --> 20:59.835
Not exactly dealing with high society
taking photos of cheating spouses.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.461
Then why are you talking to the Mayor?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.718
- Who says I am?
- Your phone records.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.135
Did...

21:05.222 --> 21:09.011
Did you get a warrant for that
'cause I know you're all by the book.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.808
What's your business with Mayor Bellows?

21:10.895 --> 21:11.885
Nothing.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.847
Just call and tell him
what a swell job I think he is doing.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.976
Fifteen times.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.483
Twelve of those were butt dials.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.777
All right, look, whatever.
We'll go talk to the Mayor ourselves.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.104
He's a huge fan of Joe's.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.398
- Yeah, you go do that.
- All right.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.573
I'm gonna stay here.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.826
<i>Stretch my legs.</i>

21:29.747 --> 21:32.785
Ramon, do you think it's wise
to be sneaking around

21:32.875 --> 21:34.741
a technologically weaponized facility?

21:35.127 --> 21:38.211
It's a lot safer than what
I'm up against out there. So...

21:38.297 --> 21:40.129
Coffee didn't go well, I take it.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.247
Well...

21:41.383 --> 21:44.797
Gypsy's dad wants to hunt me
for 24 hours

21:44.887 --> 21:47.220
to see if I'm worthy of his daughter.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.470
No powers.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.924
So, don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do about that.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.099
Fight back.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.223
I swear,
it's like you're trying to listen,

21:54.396 --> 21:56.854
but you just nod while you're
thinking of something else.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.102
You're doing it right now.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.024
Fight back, Ramon. What did you say?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.772
You said no powers?

22:01.862 --> 22:02.978
Yeah, go ahead.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.689
Well, in addition to being Vibe,
you have another superpower.

22:05.783 --> 22:07.524
You're smart, in here, all right?

22:07.618 --> 22:09.860
Outwardly, you're weak, all right?
Too much.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.697
But use your outwardly weak
appearance to your advantage.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.122
He's gonna anticipate a pathetic target.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.079
Well, you're pathetic...
You're pathetic, you're weak.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.330
Not helping, just hurting.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.207
All I'm saying is set a trap, okay?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.414
Beat him at his own game, set a trap.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.296
- Set a trap.
- That's right, a trap.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.382
A trap, I can do.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.339
'Cause he may be the Predator,

22:32.393 --> 22:33.634
but I'm the Schwarzenegger.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.597
<i>Where is he?</i>

22:42.278 --> 22:43.644
He was here.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.192
Yeah, he went that way.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.326
I farted.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.534
I'm not sure everything is still
where it's supposed to be down there.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.369
- Drink this.
- What is it?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.246
I don't just drink stuff.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.089
My body is a temple.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.798
Clearly. Drink it.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.217
I want to know what it is.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.669
It's 17% alcohol.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.048
You should've led with that, sister.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.807
Oh!

23:13.976 --> 23:14.966
What was that?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.393
It's a serum of sulfur, zinc oxide,

23:17.479 --> 23:19.971
and steric acid
to cross-link your polymerized cells.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.393
In English.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.564
It's gonna fix you.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.324
You did it! I'm cured!

23:31.410 --> 23:32.400
Well, not cured.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.451
All I did was introduce
a stabilizing enzyme

23:34.538 --> 23:37.827
to reset your body to default shape
through vulcanization.

23:39.668 --> 23:40.829
It's like muscle memory.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.995
Muscle memory, huh? Huh...

23:45.132 --> 23:46.964
How far back memory, you think?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.167
I don't know.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.129
Think about the shape you wanna be
and just be it.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.022
I'm back. I look like a Hemsworth.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.736
- Joseph.
- Thank you for meeting us.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.868
Quick stop on my way to a hospital
ribbon cutting, no problem.

24:15.079 --> 24:17.446
What's with you? You're glowing.

24:17.831 --> 24:18.992
No.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.415
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.710
Well, how can I help you, gentlemen?
I got a lot on my schedule today.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.662
We won't take up
much of your time, Mr. Mayor.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.088
Do you know a man named Ralph Dibny?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.585
Doesn't ring a bell. Who is he?

24:28.676 --> 24:31.510
He is a former cop
turned private investigator.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.676
I don't think so.

24:32.763 --> 24:35.176
Really? He called your office
over a dozen times.

24:35.349 --> 24:38.183
Oh, I'm gonna have to check
with my secretary.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.060
Anthony, you used to be a cop.

24:48.612 --> 24:51.195
We're not talking to the Mayor here,
it's three cops talking.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.654
Whatever cops say to each other,
they don't say to anybody else.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.952
What's going on with you and Dibny?

24:59.999 --> 25:00.989
I...

25:02.918 --> 25:04.910
- Made a mistake.
<i>- "Mistake"?</i>

25:05.671 --> 25:08.163
You mean, like,
the kind of mistake you make

25:08.257 --> 25:09.589
with a woman who's not your wife?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.050
It was only that one time, Joe.

25:16.432 --> 25:20.221
I regretted it the moment I did it
and I broke it off right away.

25:21.395 --> 25:25.935
And then, Dibny shows up,
and he's got pictures of us.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.860
And he threatens to show them
to my wife unless I pay him.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.983
- How much?
- Not enough.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.568
<i>All those phone calls,</i>

25:34.992 --> 25:37.200
it was him negotiating
for a bigger price.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.070
<i>I love my family, Joe.</i>

25:41.123 --> 25:44.457
Just let me pay him
and I'll be done with it.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.159
No, Mr. Mayor,
you're not gonna have to do that.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.369
We're gonna take care of it.

25:49.173 --> 25:52.041
Joe, Barry, thank you.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.510
So much for Dibny changing.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.724
Dibny's alive and talking. Find him.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.769
- I want those pictures and his head.
- And the cops?

26:04.855 --> 26:07.438
What do I care about the cops?
Waste them.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.728
- Your vitals are fantastic.
- Good.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.605
You're blackmailing the Mayor?

26:15.699 --> 26:18.487
Classic Barry Allen, enters the room
and accuses wildly.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.863
We know about the photos, Ralph.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.319
Bellows told us everything.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.905
Hey, I'm not the one who told him
to step out on his wife.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.500
That's your defense? It's his fault
that you're extorting him.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.078
Isn't that a little easy for you to say?

26:30.172 --> 26:33.461
Your fancy lab, your good job,
and your hot girlfriend.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.839
People like me are just trying
to get from one bill to the next.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.215
And I wouldn't
have to be living like that

26:38.305 --> 26:40.092
if you hadn't cost me my job.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.798
You got yourself fired.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.350
You tampered with evidence,
you framed that guy.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.768
Because he was guilty.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.267
And he was gonna get away
with killing his wife,

26:48.357 --> 26:49.814
and then you let him go.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.234
I was a good cop,
I was a good detective.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.521
I lost everything.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.117
Mayor's got plenty of money,
he can afford to spare a little.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.371
Consider it the pension you cost me.

27:10.462 --> 27:14.172
Good people don't destroy lives
and call it noble.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.885
You were dirty then, you're dirty now.
Live with that.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.847
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get off me.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.314
Are you kidding me?

27:37.072 --> 27:39.689
Thanks for ruining my life twice, Allen.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.079
<i>Cisky.</i>

27:55.591 --> 27:57.048
Show yourself.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.672
No one can avoid me forever.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.179
I'm not going to.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.632
Are you kidding me?

28:05.809 --> 28:08.017
Say goodbye, my little enemy.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.143
What the Sheol?

28:16.486 --> 28:19.945
Guess who's got a hologram?

28:20.407 --> 28:23.115
Ho, ho, ho.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.074
Bet you're wondering
what this is.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.077
This is an anti-vibrational force field
with an oscillating power grid.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.875
Good enough for the Reverse-Flash.
Good enough for you.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.040
<i>So, you might as well
wave your white flag</i>

28:35.130 --> 28:37.747
'cause you aren't
getting out of this thing

28:37.841 --> 28:40.424
until the clock strikes Cisco's victory.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.676
Oh, victory.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.503
Feels good.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.926
I pulled this from the body
of an Earth-48 hunter-killer.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.306
You can't trap a trapper.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.251
I just needed to cool off.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.828
I figured.

29:18.632 --> 29:22.091
Dibny seemed to have
gotten under your skin.

29:23.512 --> 29:27.506
Why is it so important
to you that he be the bad guy?

29:29.643 --> 29:33.432
When I first started at CCPD,
all I cared about was the rules.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.229
<i>But, you know, these last few years,</i>

29:35.315 --> 29:37.853
<i>we've locked up meta-humans
without a trial,</i>

29:37.985 --> 29:41.695
played with time and space,
messed with other worlds.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.109
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with Dibny?

29:44.241 --> 29:48.076
Just that everything we've done, we did
because we were trying to help people,

29:48.161 --> 29:49.322
keep them safe.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.028
Hmm.

29:52.207 --> 29:55.575
Is that all Dibny was
trying to do back then?

29:57.587 --> 30:01.251
"Good people don't destroy lives
and call it noble."

30:02.718 --> 30:04.630
Did I make a mistake back then?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.424
Did I cost a good man his life?

30:07.973 --> 30:08.963
I don't know, Barr.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.056
<i>He did break the law, cross the line.</i>

30:11.393 --> 30:12.759
You didn't make him do that.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.429
And you didn't make him
blackmail the Mayor.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.473
<i>But maybe Caitlin was right.</i>

30:19.026 --> 30:20.016
Everyone who has gone through

30:20.110 --> 30:23.103
what you and her
and now Dibny has gone through...

30:23.405 --> 30:25.192
<i>Maybe he deserves a second chance.</i>

30:28.076 --> 30:29.317
I got it.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.698
Allen.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.750
Detective West.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.078
Aren't you two on the Mayor's detail?

30:40.630 --> 30:43.043
Sorry to bother you at home,
but dispatch just radioed.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.466
Captain Singh needs you
down at the station ASAP.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.877
All right, let me get my jacket.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.046
Barr!

31:07.657 --> 31:09.193
That never gets old.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.525
Those two work for the Mayor.

31:10.619 --> 31:14.329
- They just tried to kill us.
- Dibny's next.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.166
Cisky, Cisky, Cisky.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.503
Cisky.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.048
Cisky.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.010
<i>Come out.</i>

31:29.221 --> 31:31.133
Come out and meet your end.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.010
Plastoid.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.809
You creatures destroyed my planet.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.939
Now, I will kill every last one of you.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.030
<i>Guys! Anyone there?</i>

31:59.000 --> 32:00.992
Barry, I'm here, it's me!

32:01.086 --> 32:02.167
What's up?

32:02.254 --> 32:04.712
<i>I need you to activate the tracker
I put on Dibny.</i>

32:04.798 --> 32:06.255
You put a tracker on Ralph?

32:09.136 --> 32:10.217
Plastoid.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.169
<i>Cisco, do you know where he is?</i>

32:12.472 --> 32:14.008
<i>He's at City Hall.</i>

32:33.201 --> 32:34.282
You lost weight.

32:34.828 --> 32:36.160
Lap-band surgery.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.204
Since killing you didn't work out...

32:42.294 --> 32:44.286
What we agreed upon, 200K.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.413
Let me have the photographs.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.624
Here's the pictures.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.847
- Keep the money.
- What?

32:56.933 --> 32:57.923
I take it back.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.304
"Take it back"?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.226
I take my blackmail back.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.555
Is this some kind of a trick?

33:03.857 --> 33:04.847
I'm not dirty.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.604
And I don't want
any part in this anymore.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.027
And don't you forget.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.652
I can tie you to that bomb you had
your goons plant in my office,

33:13.742 --> 33:17.031
so, if you don't walk away,
I will go to the cops.

33:17.996 --> 33:18.986
That's still blackmail.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.537
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.115
You're telling me
if I don't give you this money,

33:22.209 --> 33:23.325
you won't go to the cops.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.034
Okay, fine.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.586
I am blackmailing you
into not being blackmailed.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.214
So, we're good, then?

33:31.635 --> 33:32.625
Yeah, we're good.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.846
Bullet booger. Super gross.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.852
<i>Sorry, Mr. Mayor...</i>

33:49.736 --> 33:50.897
It's over.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.575
Die, Plastoid, die!

34:04.918 --> 34:09.708
You will not infest this world
as you did mine, Plastoid!

34:10.047 --> 34:11.630
Plastoid? What? Is he talking to me?

34:11.716 --> 34:13.503
Breacher, stop.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.753
Okay.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.010
He dies, speedster.

34:21.518 --> 34:22.884
Joe, get in there, Joe.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.435
- You're coming with me, come on.
- Flash!

34:34.155 --> 34:36.522
Look, you don't have to do this.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.315
Yes, I do!

34:45.083 --> 34:46.494
Leave him alone.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.085
This guy didn't invade your planet,
he didn't do anything wrong.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.630
He's like this 'cause of me and my team.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.007
So, if you've got a problem
with him and his powers,

34:56.344 --> 34:57.551
then you deal with me.

35:08.148 --> 35:09.138
Hey, are we good here?

35:09.232 --> 35:11.815
Because I definitely
got to change my drawers.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.612
The Mayor took Joe.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.024
I can't run fast enough right now.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.405
I'll never have enough speed
to jump off a building.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.986
Can you breach me up there?

35:24.080 --> 35:26.618
There's no way, the event horizon would
rip the helicopter apart.

35:26.708 --> 35:27.744
<i>We got to save Joe.</i>

35:27.834 --> 35:28.870
What do we do?

35:31.755 --> 35:32.996
You can get me up there.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.375
- Me?
- Yeah.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.958
- How?
- You can stretch, grab it!

35:37.052 --> 35:38.759
Are you crazy? I can't do that.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.381
Yes, you can. All right?

35:40.472 --> 35:44.136
I know that you have it inside you
to help someone other than yourself.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.466
I know you, Ralph.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.052
How could you possibly know me?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.609
Dude, are you kidding me?

35:55.695 --> 35:56.936
You're the Flash?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.987
Everyone else gets
struck by lightning and dies,

35:59.074 --> 36:01.031
- and you get superpowers?
- Yeah, that's right.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.741
Your assistant's a speedster?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.864
I liked the Flash,
now I have to hate the Flash.

36:04.954 --> 36:08.368
Ralph, focus. I need you to do this.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.700
Joe needs you to do this, please.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.376
Show me I was wrong about you.

36:12.462 --> 36:15.921
You said you were a good cop,
be one, right now.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.528
What the hell?

36:39.656 --> 36:40.646
I got it!

36:42.117 --> 36:43.107
Whoa-whoa!

36:46.371 --> 36:48.078
<i>- Help!</i>
- Hold on, Ralph.

37:04.681 --> 37:05.762
Cecile's pregnant.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.294
Well, we've reached the end of our road.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.967
We had some stumbles along the way,

37:44.053 --> 37:46.761
but we pulled it together,
we made it home.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.256
I hate you.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.467
Wow, really thought that one would work.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.426
But I respect you.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.387
You're a steadfast warrior

37:54.481 --> 37:57.690
who would fight the fiercest
of enemies to protect your friend,

37:57.984 --> 38:00.021
and the only person I love.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.727
With my dying breath, sir.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.903
I know that, but I still hate you.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.786
I have never seen him gush like that.

38:10.872 --> 38:11.988
That's gushing?

38:12.081 --> 38:14.038
I'm terrified
to experience him loving me.

38:15.376 --> 38:19.245
- Well, that's my job.
- That's right. It is.

38:21.591 --> 38:25.426
I feel a code-17 breach in progress.
We have to leave now, Cynthia.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.136
Cynthia? Cynthia?

38:31.309 --> 38:32.550
What's your dad's name?

38:33.978 --> 38:34.968
Josh.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.723
Cynthia and Josh!

38:39.317 --> 38:40.558
<i>That's great.</i>

38:40.652 --> 38:42.393
Not so scary now, Cynthia.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.069
Keep calling me that, see what happens.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.646
All right.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.941
See you around, Gypsy.

39:31.661 --> 39:34.995
- I fixed up your office.
- Sweet fancy Moses!

39:35.582 --> 39:37.790
Thanks for screwing up
my insurance claim.

39:37.876 --> 39:41.165
No payout, no Mayor money,
I got to pick up a case soon.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.164
What if I had a job for you?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.498
I want to laugh really hard right now,

39:45.592 --> 39:47.584
but I'm afraid my face
will fall off again.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.761
I can't change what has happened
between us in the past,

39:50.847 --> 39:54.090
<i>but I can offer you a chance
to change what happens in our future.</i>

39:54.183 --> 39:55.173
How?

39:55.268 --> 39:58.181
Let my team and I study your powers,

39:58.271 --> 40:01.264
figure out how to improve them,
see what your limitations are.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.811
And let me train you.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.401
Train me? For what?

40:06.654 --> 40:07.735
To do what I do.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.607
To be a detective again, Ralph.

40:11.701 --> 40:12.862
<i>A real one.</i>

40:12.952 --> 40:15.319
<i>Look, it's not gonna be easy,
I'm gonna push you to your limit.</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:17.496
It's safe to say some days,
you're gonna hate me.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.915
Allen, it's safe to say
that I always hate you.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.619
Do I get a cool superhero name?

40:23.963 --> 40:26.421
What do you think about Plastic Man?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.207
I think that's the dumbest name
I've ever heard.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.837
It's Cisco who comes up with the names.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.214
Yeah, it's better that way.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.419
What do you say?

40:43.733 --> 40:45.520
There's just one thing I got to ask you.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.604
What made you look into Mayor Bellows
in the first place?

40:49.822 --> 40:52.155
It was a client who
asked me to follow the Mayor.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.233
Never met him, though,
he did everything over the phone.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.317
Who was it?

40:55.536 --> 40:57.198
Only gave me his last name.

40:57.622 --> 40:58.829
DeVoe.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.408
<i>You and I have been
enemies for years.</i>

41:02.627 --> 41:04.414
You've had others, of course.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.420
There's Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe.

41:07.507 --> 41:10.625
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

41:11.177 --> 41:12.463
to use against DeVoe.

41:15.348 --> 41:18.056
What's wrong?
The name "DeVoe" mean something to you?

41:21.604 --> 41:22.845
I smell a mystery.
