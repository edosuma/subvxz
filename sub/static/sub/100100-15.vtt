has been focused.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.635
Her plans are always
calculated, pointed.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.178
Collateral damage is minimized,

15:30.220 --> 15:31.889
but this type
of chemical exposure

15:31.931 --> 15:33.097
will undo all of that.

15:33.139 --> 15:36.476
Any wisps of sanity
Alice is clinging to

15:36.518 --> 15:37.894
will dissolve in the wind.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.938
If she doesn't jump
off the nearest rooftop,

15:39.980 --> 15:41.649
well, then...

15:41.690 --> 15:44.817
I imagine she'll
unravel completely,

15:44.860 --> 15:48.780
out herself to Gotham in
the process of going nuclear.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.951
I would hate to be in the
blast radius when that happens.

15:52.993 --> 15:57.121
Dad, stop! Stop, dad!

15:58.499 --> 16:00.500
Dad! Unh!

16:00.542 --> 16:03.711
If you kill him,
then we are no better than he is.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.505
Not to mention you'll
never find out

16:05.547 --> 16:08.384
where Alice is being tortured.

16:08.424 --> 16:11.845
Hoo. I can only imagine
the darkness

16:11.886 --> 16:13.596
she has inside of her.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.682
I have a feeling I know exactly

16:15.724 --> 16:17.768
who's paying her a visit.

16:17.809 --> 16:18.894
Who?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.854
Mommy dearest.

16:23.106 --> 16:26.235
[Footsteps]

16:26.275 --> 16:28.528
Young Alice: I beg pardon,
your majesty.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.989
Put it there, girl.

16:30.029 --> 16:32.950
I was as beautiful as you once.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.826
You're still beautiful, ma'am.

16:34.868 --> 16:35.494
I'm a circus act.

16:35.536 --> 16:39.748
Leashed to this can of air
like it's my damn dog.

16:39.789 --> 16:42.750
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.168
I wasted my life with a man

16:44.211 --> 16:48.756
who never loved me
and took too long to die.

16:48.798 --> 16:51.009
Now not only am I alone,

16:51.051 --> 16:53.177
I'm alone and old.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.556
I'm sorry, your majesty.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.153
Have you ever made tea, Alice?

17:09.193 --> 17:09.694
I have.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.945
Then you ought to know
how to keep it

17:11.989 --> 17:14.074
from being so sweet!

17:15.241 --> 17:17.617
Alice: I'm sorry, your majesty.

17:20.788 --> 17:22.082
I thought you wanted it sweet.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.084
You were wrong.
Hold out your hands.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.461
I thought you wanted it sweet.

17:25.501 --> 17:26.752
I thought you wanted it sweet!

17:26.795 --> 17:29.798
I said hold out
your hands, girl!

17:29.839 --> 17:31.299
[Whimpering]

17:31.340 --> 17:34.052
- No, please.
- Palms up!

17:36.346 --> 17:38.057
No. I swear I didn't...

17:38.097 --> 17:39.432
[screaming]

17:39.474 --> 17:40.768
How many times have I told you?

17:40.808 --> 17:42.810
If it's too hot for the hands,

17:42.853 --> 17:45.646
it's too hot for the lips.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.106
[Moaning]

17:47.148 --> 17:49.777
You changed your hair.

17:49.817 --> 17:52.153
Why would you change your hair?

17:52.195 --> 17:55.907
No. I kept it short
just as you like it.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.910
You colored it.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.369
It was so pretty.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.789
What did you do, Alice?

18:03.664 --> 18:07.044
You were such a pretty girl.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.170
[Moaning]

18:08.211 --> 18:09.337
No, no, no. I love my hair.

18:09.378 --> 18:10.982
- Please don't.
- Your hair wants cutting!

18:11.006 --> 18:13.217
I'm sorry. Please stop it.

No. No.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.642
We're out of cream!

18:21.682 --> 18:23.977
I assure you I brought cream.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.271
Why are we out of cream, Alice?

18:27.314 --> 18:31.943
I'll find some.
I'll go now. I'll find some.

18:41.077 --> 18:45.082
No, no, no. No, no.
We can't have run out.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.791
No, no.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.422
[Woman vocalizing]

19:01.807 --> 19:05.394
There's no cream.
We haven't any cream.

[Breathing heavily]

19:21.742 --> 19:23.787
What are you doing here?

19:25.329 --> 19:26.832
Why is this locked?

19:26.874 --> 19:27.290
Why are you here?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.585
I need cream
for the queen's tea.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.711
There's no cream out here.

19:31.752 --> 19:34.839
I'm desperate. She hates me.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.299
Mother doesn't hate you.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.925
She does hate me because I am

19:37.968 --> 19:39.177
young and beautiful

19:39.219 --> 19:42.722
and she's old and haggard.

19:44.223 --> 19:46.518
It was my mother

19:46.559 --> 19:50.063
who siphoned her happiness,

19:50.105 --> 19:53.317
snuffed her spark,
beat her so hard

19:53.357 --> 19:56.028
and so often that
eventually it was easier

19:56.068 --> 19:59.948
for Alice to be numb than human.

20:00.156 --> 20:06.747
I imagine now in the
throes of Alice's madness

20:06.788 --> 20:11.375
my mother is once again
calling for her tea.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.752
You threw Beth in a cellar

20:12.794 --> 20:16.673
and taught her how
to carve up faces,

20:16.714 --> 20:20.009
but mommy is the bad guy?

20:20.051 --> 20:22.846
Nice try.

20:22.887 --> 20:24.222
I am gonna find her,

20:24.263 --> 20:27.893
and then I'm gonna
skin you alive.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.147
This is his. Trace it,

20:33.190 --> 20:36.734
see if we can find out
where he led Alice.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.036
How about a glass of water?

20:46.077 --> 20:47.996
How about not?

20:48.038 --> 20:51.375
Is that why Alice told me to
ask about mommy dearest?

20:51.415 --> 20:54.920
Because your mom was
the one that broke her?

20:54.961 --> 20:57.964
She wanted you to hear her story

20:58.006 --> 21:01.259
and get you to kill me.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.971
She wanted to break you, too.

21:04.011 --> 21:05.305
You're wrong.

21:05.346 --> 21:08.933
She knows I would
never kill anyone.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.228
Because...

21:11.269 --> 21:14.146
You're so different?

21:14.189 --> 21:16.066
We are different.

21:16.107 --> 21:17.984
Then be merciful.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.655
Give me water.

21:22.698 --> 21:26.034
I'll tell you where she is.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.577
You never knew my real sister.

21:28.619 --> 21:31.748
The girl I grew up with

21:31.789 --> 21:34.417
was kind and good,

21:34.459 --> 21:36.336
had a soft spot for people who

21:36.377 --> 21:39.381
didn't necessarily deserve it.

21:50.182 --> 21:53.561
Now tell me where Alice is.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.773
You'll never find her!

22:11.038 --> 22:12.663
Luke: So you paid a guy
a thousand bucks

22:12.705 --> 22:14.265
to tell you there's
a car in a junkyard.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.959
How much will you give me
if I tell you

22:16.000 --> 22:17.376
there's sand at the beach?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.171
Ok. Why don't we chase
down one of the leads

22:19.211 --> 22:19.939
that you've generated?

22:19.963 --> 22:24.468
So you don't happen to have a cool,
gadgety thingamado

22:24.509 --> 22:27.887
to help us narrow down the search,
do you,

22:27.929 --> 22:28.657
you know, from work?

22:28.681 --> 22:33.809
Sorry. How would a real estate
gadget help with this exactly?

22:33.852 --> 22:36.480
- Forget it.
- Ok. Look. Obviously, mad dog

22:36.520 --> 22:37.189
was high on something,
and if we put faith

22:37.230 --> 22:40.107
in anything that he said,
we're just as high as he was.

22:40.150 --> 22:45.279
Ok. So if you were gonna get high,
where would you go?

22:45.322 --> 22:48.866
No idea because I wouldn't.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.744
But if you were, you would go

22:51.787 --> 22:55.539
somewhere where it was warm.

22:55.582 --> 23:01.337
Oh! It's got to be
around here somewhere.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.882
There. That's the only car

for ever doubting you.

I'm sorry. Batwoman's
calling you?

How do I close
a severe neck wound?

23:59.688 --> 24:02.566
- Yours?
- No, no, he's a bad guy.

24:02.606 --> 24:03.942
He has information that I need.

24:03.983 --> 24:05.443
Can you get him to a hospital?

24:05.484 --> 24:06.819
Would I be calling if I could?

24:06.862 --> 24:09.280
Right. Ok. Is it
the carotid artery?

24:09.321 --> 24:11.907
Carotid artery? Is she ok?

24:12.159 --> 24:16.413
Is the blood flow
pulsing, rhythmic?

24:16.454 --> 24:17.705
- No.
- Ok.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.415
Then it's not
the carotid artery,

24:19.458 --> 24:20.935
but you still need
to close the wound.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.377
Do you have a needle and thread?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.130

my first choice.

- Anything?
- No. Nothing's coming out.

24:55.451 --> 24:56.536
Yes.

24:56.577 --> 24:58.413
Ok. Good. I mean, I think

24:58.454 --> 24:59.623
that's a good thing.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.083
You said he was a bad guy.

you would rather die than help me,

the less likely

28:00.178 --> 28:03.138
Let me know if he's
telling the truth.

28:04.848 --> 28:06.934
Luke: I don't get it.
I'm not getting any hits

28:06.976 --> 28:08.060
on this license plate.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.688
Are you sure you
entered it right?

28:09.729 --> 28:11.855
Yeah. Pretty sure I typed
in all 6 digits correctly

28:11.897 --> 28:14.692
the first 5 times
I entered them.

28:19.279 --> 28:19.966
What are you doing?

28:19.990 --> 28:25.537
Um, I was just curious about
"the international periodical"

28:25.577 --> 28:29.207
"of technology and
innovation" volume 2.

28:29.249 --> 28:29.766
Got a book report due?

28:29.790 --> 28:30.518
Well, I could have
finished reading it

28:30.542 --> 28:33.877
in the time it's taken you
to find one license plate.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.880
I thought you were,
like, Kate's tech guru.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.048
I've been searching
active registrations.

28:38.090 --> 28:41.594
I didn't search inactive.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.638
Yes. Ok. I got something.

28:45.181 --> 28:49.477
Ok. Uh, looks like
the plates expired

28:49.519 --> 28:51.354
20 years ago.

28:51.395 --> 28:51.915
Whose car is it?

28:51.939 --> 28:54.857
Well, the car was last
registered to...

28:57.067 --> 28:58.944
- What?
- Mabel Cartwright,

28:58.987 --> 29:01.865
August Cartwright's mother.

29:01.905 --> 29:04.409
We need to call Kate.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.202
[Sobbing]

29:11.750 --> 29:14.335
[Screaming]

29:16.628 --> 29:19.382
[Gasping]

29:20.759 --> 29:22.469
Aah!

29:25.346 --> 29:28.016
[Sobbing]

29:37.733 --> 29:41.403
[Sobbing] I... can't.

29:41.613 --> 29:46.492
I can't... I can't do this again!

29:46.534 --> 29:48.536
I can't...

29:48.577 --> 29:50.829
Be locked away.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.993
"And she began by taking

30:30.036 --> 30:31.829
the little golden key"...

30:31.871 --> 30:34.790
[Sniffles]

30:36.416 --> 30:39.796
"And unlocking the door...

30:39.837 --> 30:42.882
"That led into...

30:42.923 --> 30:45.468
Into the garden."

30:45.509 --> 30:49.180
Jacob: No! Alice, please, no.

30:49.221 --> 30:51.723
Get away from me!

30:51.766 --> 30:52.892
You're not real.

30:52.933 --> 30:54.269
I'm real.

30:54.309 --> 30:58.105
Alice... it's me.

31:09.909 --> 31:10.993
Aah!

31:11.035 --> 31:13.203
Adrenaline. It's adrenaline.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.374
It nullifies the toxin.

31:16.415 --> 31:17.834
You're ok now.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.711
[Sobbing]

31:19.751 --> 31:21.587
Daddy?

31:44.568 --> 31:46.653
Where's Kate?

31:47.238 --> 31:53.243
Waiting outside with
her hand on the door?

31:53.286 --> 31:55.704
She's with Cartwright.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.709
She was the one who got
him to tell us where you were.

31:59.750 --> 32:03.171
And you came running.

32:03.211 --> 32:04.838
Why?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.924
Because I care

32:06.965 --> 32:08.843
and to keep you hanging on
to whatever sense

32:08.884 --> 32:12.846
of sanity you have left.

32:12.888 --> 32:15.141
Touching.

32:16.726 --> 32:20.020
Well,
I take it if Cartwright's still alive

32:20.063 --> 32:22.522
he hasn't gotten to
the part in the story

32:22.565 --> 32:24.692
about mommy dearest.

32:24.733 --> 32:27.194
Oh, he told us everything.

32:27.236 --> 32:31.406
His mother sounded like a treat.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.409
His mother?

32:37.579 --> 32:41.250
Is that who you think
this is about?

32:47.256 --> 32:49.549
Where's Mabel right now?

32:49.592 --> 32:51.469
Your sister didn't tell you?

32:51.510 --> 32:53.136
Tell me what?

32:53.179 --> 32:54.721
Mother died years ago.

32:54.763 --> 32:56.432
So you were driving her car.

32:56.473 --> 32:58.768
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

32:58.809 --> 33:03.564
Did you shoot a woman who
you believed to be my sister?

33:06.692 --> 33:08.819
Answer me.

33:08.861 --> 33:10.278
We made a deal.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.825
Hmm? I talk, I walk
out of here alive.

33:13.865 --> 33:16.868
Did you shoot a woman
in a motel parking lot

33:16.911 --> 33:19.163
who you believed to be Alice?

33:19.204 --> 33:23.792
She... looked exactly like her.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.336
The face, the eyes.

33:26.378 --> 33:28.381
Of course you did. Ergh!

33:28.423 --> 33:30.008
Of course it was you!

33:30.048 --> 33:32.093
I swore it was her.

33:33.427 --> 33:35.555
Even wore a necklace
that matched

33:35.596 --> 33:38.016
those damned earrings.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.643
What did you just say?

33:44.271 --> 33:47.150
What necklace matched
what earrings?

33:47.191 --> 33:49.943
The ones my mother so coveted

33:49.986 --> 33:52.070
and caused all the problems.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.406
What earrings?

33:59.412 --> 34:01.455
How do they look?

34:06.794 --> 34:08.963
Where did you get those?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.965
They were a gift from my son.

34:15.302 --> 34:17.137
That was the moment I remembered

34:17.179 --> 34:20.016
where I got my necklace.

34:20.056 --> 34:24.228
It was meant to match
mother's earrings...

34:24.771 --> 34:29.900
So that Kate and I could always
keep her close to our heart.

34:56.635 --> 35:01.099
How did Cartwright know
about gabi's earrings?

35:01.139 --> 35:03.518
Trust me, daddy.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.940
Some things...

35:08.981 --> 35:11.233
Are better left...

35:11.275 --> 35:15.028
Alice, tell me where he
got the damn earrings!

35:19.492 --> 35:22.536
Exactly where you think.

35:33.255 --> 35:35.340
Cartwright: My mother
wanted a fresh start.

35:35.382 --> 35:37.260
She begged for your
mother's face

35:37.300 --> 35:39.512
from the day I fished
it out of the river,

35:39.554 --> 35:41.847
and as she got older,

35:41.889 --> 35:44.266
her obsession only got worse,

35:44.307 --> 35:45.768
but I kept pushing it off,

35:45.809 --> 35:48.103
knowing it would cause
trouble when she took on

35:48.146 --> 35:51.690
the face of a dead woman, but...

35:51.731 --> 35:55.235
It gave her something
to live for.

35:55.277 --> 35:59.282
Your mother was
a beautiful woman, Kate.

35:59.322 --> 36:03.244
It would have been a pity
for her to go to waste.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.288
[Grunting]

36:05.329 --> 36:07.623
Mabel: The tea's gone cold.

36:07.664 --> 36:11.460
I said I need you
to warm this tea.

36:11.501 --> 36:14.297
Consider it a pleasure.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.132
What the hell are you doing?

36:17.175 --> 36:19.217
Long live the queen.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.429
[Screaming]

36:28.351 --> 36:31.271
You stole everything from me!

36:34.358 --> 36:37.320
[Gagging]

36:40.322 --> 36:42.157
Egggh!

36:42.532 --> 36:45.619
Gabi: Red is
a very symbolic color.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.244
It's the color of love.

36:46.286 --> 36:50.875
It's also the color
of passion, courage, war.

36:50.916 --> 36:54.085
At one point or another,
you're going to have to wrestle

36:54.128 --> 36:56.172
with all of these emotions,

36:56.213 --> 36:59.300
and what defines your character

36:59.342 --> 37:01.760
is how you balance them.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.766
Come on. Come on!

37:09.434 --> 37:11.811
Live!

37:11.853 --> 37:13.146
[Grunting]

37:13.188 --> 37:15.565
Come on! Live!

37:22.239 --> 37:23.449
Help me.

37:23.490 --> 37:25.576
No, no. He can't be dead.

37:25.617 --> 37:27.077
Kate, what did you do?

37:27.119 --> 37:28.246
Please, dad. Save him.

37:28.286 --> 37:30.748
Wake up, you son of a bitch!

37:30.789 --> 37:33.708
[Puffing air]

37:39.965 --> 37:42.385
Kate.

37:42.425 --> 37:46.389
"'Oh, I've had such a curious dream,
' said Alice,

37:46.429 --> 37:52.769
"and she told her sister all
these strange adventures of hers,

37:52.811 --> 37:54.688
"and when she had finished,

37:54.730 --> 37:57.275
"her sister kissed her and said,

37:57.315 --> 37:59.902
"'it was a curious dream, dear.

37:59.943 --> 38:01.737
"'Now run in to your tea.

38:01.778 --> 38:03.905
"It's getting late.'

38:03.947 --> 38:07.117
"so Alice got up and ran off,

38:07.159 --> 38:09.704
thinking while she ran"...

38:12.956 --> 38:16.710
"What a wonderful dream
it had been."

38:23.925 --> 38:26.846
[Sighs]

38:26.887 --> 38:30.432
Congratulations, daddy.

38:30.474 --> 38:34.811
Now both your daughters
are killers.

38:45.322 --> 38:46.574
Died 7 years ago.

38:46.614 --> 38:48.284
Burned to death in a house fire

38:48.326 --> 38:49.803
right around the time
Cartwright disappeared.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.371
And the next time he
crawls out of the woodwork,

38:52.413 --> 38:53.456
he kills Beth.

38:53.496 --> 38:54.081
We should have seen this coming.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.250
Hey. Don't make this harder
by blaming yourself.

38:56.291 --> 39:00.755
That's easier said that
done after watching Beth...

39:00.795 --> 39:02.130
Die in my arms.

39:02.172 --> 39:04.300
If I know, Kate, she won't rest

39:04.342 --> 39:07.927
till she brings
that monster to justice.

39:09.429 --> 39:14.018
Kate, voice-over: I thought
I found the balance, Bruce,

39:14.059 --> 39:15.478
but I was wrong.

39:15.518 --> 39:17.480
I crossed the line,

39:17.521 --> 39:21.233
and now I'm the very thing
I've been fighting against.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.199
[Sighs]

40:16.914 --> 40:19.541
Can I get one on the house?

40:27.465 --> 40:28.152
Ahh.

40:28.176 --> 40:31.512
We're gonna need this with
the night we have ahead of us.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.097
What do you mean?

40:34.139 --> 40:36.474
Last time I checked,

40:36.516 --> 40:40.228
bodies don't Bury themselves.

41:23.938 --> 41:26.358
Man: Greg, move your head!
