WEBVTT

00:15.615 --> 00:17.157
Put your anchor.

00:31.172 --> 00:32.583
Team one, go!

00:46.312 --> 00:47.510
Clear.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.742
Lieutenant, planning on joining us?

01:04.497 --> 01:05.777
On my way.

01:57.792 --> 01:58.990
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.453
- How was your weekend?
- Let's see.

02:01.545 --> 02:04.914
I paid bills, did laundry,
went shopping, vacuumed.

02:05.466 --> 02:08.383
- I bet you don't even own a vacuum.
- I lease.

02:10.012 --> 02:11.921
Okay. So what did you do this weekend

02:12.014 --> 02:14.932
that left that smile
plastered all over your face?

02:15.518 --> 02:20.393
- I watched a great movie.
- Let me guess, a horror flick.

02:20.481 --> 02:22.023
Halloween 8.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.669
I think it's the best Halloween ever.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.566
Makes Halloween 7
look like Halloween 5.

02:25.653 --> 02:28.773
God, I can't even believe they made
one of them, much less eight.

02:28.864 --> 02:30.774
That's got to be
a Men are from Mars thing.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.195
Arianna liked it.

02:32.284 --> 02:34.989
Arianna?
I thought you broke up with her.

02:35.329 --> 02:38.449
- What makes you think that?
- I don't know.

02:38.541 --> 02:42.159
Maybe 'cause you came in the other day
and said, "I broke up with Arianna."

02:42.253 --> 02:44.958
You don't know much about dating,
do you?

02:45.297 --> 02:46.792
Why don't you enlighten me?

02:46.882 --> 02:50.465
Well, there's always one phoney
breakup that precedes the real breakup.

02:50.553 --> 02:53.423
- Everyone knows that.
- Yeah, got it. Thanks.

02:53.848 --> 02:57.217
Grab your gear. Kate, get Ducky.
Tony, gas the truck.

02:57.643 --> 02:59.885
- Where we going?
- With Gibbs, you never know.

03:07.611 --> 03:08.691
ID.

03:10.239 --> 03:11.947
NCIS Special Agent Gibbs.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.321
- Clear.
- Okay. Thank you, sir.

03:15.411 --> 03:16.822
- Agent Gibbs.
- Commander Rainer.

03:16.912 --> 03:17.944
SEAL team eight.

03:18.038 --> 03:20.660
- What happened here?
- We were on a training exercise.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.350
Lieutenant Johnson, the team leader,
was rappelling down the cliff

03:23.377 --> 03:24.658
when his D-link snapped.

03:24.754 --> 03:26.398
- You secure the top of the cliff?
- I did.

03:26.422 --> 03:28.191
Is that the rest
of Lieutenant Johnson's squad?

03:28.215 --> 03:29.295
Yes, sir.

03:29.383 --> 03:32.419
Appreciate it if you'd tell them
not to talk to anyone till I talk to them.

03:32.511 --> 03:34.053
Already taken care of, sir.

03:34.138 --> 03:37.803
- What an awful way to die.
- I can think of worse ways to go.

03:37.892 --> 03:39.006
Like what?

03:39.101 --> 03:41.675
Getting eaten by a shark,
being buried alive,

03:41.771 --> 03:43.229
falling into a wood chipper.

03:43.314 --> 03:44.772
You've given this some thought.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.478
- Yeah. So?
- Nothing.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.068
Someone moved the body.

03:52.156 --> 03:54.445
After he fell, his squad members
came to his assistance,

03:54.533 --> 03:56.277
see if anything could be done.

03:56.368 --> 03:58.694
Unfortunately, he died on impact.

04:00.289 --> 04:02.198
Yeah, well, that would account
for a few inches,

04:02.291 --> 04:04.616
but someone's moved him
further than that.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.501
We pulled him away
from the face of the cliff

04:06.587 --> 04:09.043
because there was falling shale.
It's an old mine.

04:09.131 --> 04:11.622
We were careful not to disturb anything.

04:14.094 --> 04:16.668
Was emptying his pockets
part of the first-aid effort?

04:16.764 --> 04:18.387
The intel was classified.

04:18.474 --> 04:20.762
We removed it
so the body could be transported.

04:20.851 --> 04:23.176
That's SOP under these circumstances.

04:23.270 --> 04:24.729
- DiNozzo.
- Yeah, boss?

04:24.814 --> 04:27.020
Top of the cliff. Shoot and sketch.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.979
Boss, it's a long way up.

04:32.071 --> 04:34.147
DiNozzo, was there something
in my tone of voice

04:34.240 --> 04:36.149
that made that sound like a suggestion?

04:36.242 --> 04:37.404
On it.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.576
Agent Gibbs, I realise you have
an investigation to perform.

04:45.668 --> 04:46.699
From what we can see,

04:46.794 --> 04:49.147
that's pretty obvious
that D-link had a catastrophic failure.

04:49.171 --> 04:51.525
You're right, Commander.
We have an investigation to perform.

04:51.549 --> 04:52.628
What do you got, Duck?

04:52.716 --> 04:56.844
Unfortunately for Lieutenant Johnson,
it appears to be just what it looks like.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.135
Well, eliminates the guesswork.

04:59.223 --> 05:01.761
Is this a common occurrence,
one of these breaking?

05:01.851 --> 05:05.219
I've never seen it happen before.
Doesn't mean it couldn't.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.983
I think we can move him.

05:14.738 --> 05:16.612
Gibbs, I got something.

05:19.410 --> 05:21.237
That a piece of the D-link?

05:23.789 --> 05:25.283
Sure looks like it.

05:29.545 --> 05:31.169
Don't worry, my friend.

05:31.255 --> 05:33.294
We'll get you cleaned up
and presentable,

05:33.382 --> 05:35.540
in a way that honours your service.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.628
Special Agent Gibbs,
Special Agent Todd.

05:40.723 --> 05:42.549
We understand you were
on a training exercise.

05:42.641 --> 05:43.886
Yes, sir.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.221
What was your mission?

05:45.311 --> 05:47.372
You'll have to talk to the commander
about that, sir.

05:47.396 --> 05:49.804
Other than
Lieutenant Johnson's accident,

05:49.899 --> 05:51.808
anything out of the ordinary happen?

05:51.901 --> 05:53.810
No, sir. It was textbook.

05:53.903 --> 05:56.738
We were inserted by helicopter,
secured our lines,

05:56.822 --> 05:59.147
rappelled down the face of the cliff.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.113
What was your order?

06:01.201 --> 06:04.617
Vengal and Kenny went first,
then myself and Pinkowski.

06:04.747 --> 06:07.748
We can't believe this happened
to the lieutenant.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.624
After the four of you
began rappelling down,

06:09.710 --> 06:11.980
was anyone on top of the cliff
other than Lieutenant Johnson?

06:12.004 --> 06:13.083
No, ma'am.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.852
Each of you will need to provide
a statement detailing what you saw.

06:15.925 --> 06:16.956
Yes, sir.

06:17.051 --> 06:18.960
I'd like Lieutenant Johnson's
service record

06:19.053 --> 06:21.378
and the personal effects from his locker.

06:21.472 --> 06:24.556
I'll have it in your office
as soon as possible.

06:24.642 --> 06:25.804
There's no sign of tampering.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.767
- That's it?
- That's it.

06:27.978 --> 06:29.805
- Then we can put this to bed?
- Not yet.

06:29.897 --> 06:33.100
I e-mailed the manufacturer
for the specs on this particular D-link.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.434
When I get them back,
I can do a comparative analysis

06:35.527 --> 06:37.650
and if nothing's hinky,
then we can put this to bed.

06:37.738 --> 06:39.066
Thanks, Abs.

06:40.616 --> 06:43.368
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Why?

06:44.370 --> 06:47.454
You're not your normal, effervescent,
cheerful Abby.

06:47.539 --> 06:49.331
That's because she's been replaced

06:49.416 --> 06:52.334
by the abnormal,
dull and melancholy Abby.

06:54.088 --> 06:57.338
- Something you want to talk about?
- I don't want to bore you.

06:57.424 --> 06:59.666
Who else you gonna tell? Tony?

07:01.595 --> 07:04.347
McGee is all mad at me.

07:04.682 --> 07:06.390
Why? What happened?

07:06.517 --> 07:09.387
We went to Buzzed.
It's a coffeehouse in Old Town.

07:09.478 --> 07:12.248
- Sunday night's like a poetry night.
- I didn't know you liked poetry.

07:12.272 --> 07:13.304
McGee likes it.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.356
So we're popping back
double espressos

07:15.442 --> 07:20.270
and all of a sudden, out of the blue,
he says, "I really, really like you."

07:21.240 --> 07:22.734
What'd you say?

07:23.325 --> 07:24.570
"Thanks."

07:25.327 --> 07:27.154
What was I supposed to say?

07:27.871 --> 07:29.282
I don't know.

07:29.873 --> 07:31.284
Then he gets, like, all quiet.

07:31.375 --> 07:35.373
And we're leaving and he wants to know
where our relationship is going.

07:35.462 --> 07:38.000
I hate that.
Why do guys have to push the issue?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.379
- Because they're insecure.
- What'd you say?

07:40.467 --> 07:42.424
Well, I said,
"Why does it have to go anywhere?

07:42.511 --> 07:44.385
"Why can't we just enjoy
what's happening now?"

07:44.471 --> 07:47.045
- What'd he say?
- "Fine. Whatever."

07:47.141 --> 07:48.599
Typical passive-aggressive.

07:48.684 --> 07:51.257
I know. I mean, what's next?

07:51.770 --> 07:55.020
We're gonna be watching
Sleepless in Seattle

07:55.107 --> 07:57.230
on a rainy Sunday afternoon?

07:58.068 --> 08:00.606
- What are you gonna do?
- No, I'm not going to do anything.

08:00.696 --> 08:02.404
I'm going to pretend
like it never happened

08:02.489 --> 08:05.159
and hopefully
he's going to do the same.

08:05.909 --> 08:09.029
The official cause of death
was multiple traumatic injuries

08:09.121 --> 08:10.948
but he was in horrible shape, Jethro.

08:11.040 --> 08:15.084
Lower leg fractures, hip fractures,
severe skull fractures.

08:15.210 --> 08:18.081
- I could go on and on...
- No, no need, Duck.

08:18.172 --> 08:21.671
Have you sent the blood up to Abby
for a full tox screen?

08:23.510 --> 08:25.467
Well, that's what you were going to ask,
right?

08:25.554 --> 08:28.804
The lifetime odds of dying
from a fall like this

08:28.891 --> 08:30.089
are roughly the equivalent

08:30.184 --> 08:34.395
of the odds of dying
from a collision with an asteroid.

08:34.645 --> 08:35.726
And?

08:36.106 --> 08:38.597
What kind of a person would I be
if I had this knowledge

08:38.692 --> 08:40.317
and I didn't share it with you?

08:40.402 --> 08:43.854
That's what you were gonna ask, right?
About the tox screen?

08:52.956 --> 08:54.451
You are late.

08:54.958 --> 08:57.794
I am so sorry, Dr Mallard.
I am so, so sorry.

08:57.878 --> 09:00.630
Don't make me have second thoughts,
Mr Palmer.

09:00.714 --> 09:01.793
Second thoughts, sir?

09:01.882 --> 09:05.132
About you coming to work full-time
as my assistant.

09:05.969 --> 09:07.962
It will never happen again, Doctor.
I promise.

09:08.055 --> 09:11.340
- It was an extremely unusual situation.
- They always are.

09:11.433 --> 09:15.016
You see, I was in the shower
and the doorbell rang,

09:15.104 --> 09:17.143
but I didn't know it at the time.

09:17.231 --> 09:20.232
- That you were in the shower?
- No, that it was the doorbell.

09:20.317 --> 09:22.890
See, my head cold
in combination with my tinnitus

09:22.986 --> 09:24.944
made me think that
it was the kitchen timer.

09:25.030 --> 09:27.568
- How very unusual.
- Yeah, so I spent several minutes

09:27.658 --> 09:29.864
trying to figure out what it was
I had finished cooking

09:29.952 --> 09:32.443
and by the time I realised
that it was the front door,

09:32.538 --> 09:35.207
I'd almost forgotten I'd taken a shower.

09:38.502 --> 09:40.080
It'll never happen again.

09:40.170 --> 09:42.079
- Who was there?
- Where?

09:42.339 --> 09:44.747
- At the door?
- I didn't answer it.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.959
I hope this won't become a habit,
Mr Palmer.

09:49.054 --> 09:53.134
- No, see, I always answer my door.
- I was referring to you being late.

09:53.976 --> 09:55.885
Does this mean I have a job?

10:22.462 --> 10:24.669
Any prints
beside Lieutenant Johnson's?

10:24.756 --> 10:26.548
I got a partial that isn't his.

10:26.633 --> 10:29.468
Run it through AFIS. And any other
database you can think of.

10:29.553 --> 10:32.388
- Done and done.
- What else you got for me, Abs?

10:32.472 --> 10:35.806
The D-link is electrolytically coated
with a protective oxide.

10:35.893 --> 10:38.514
I used Fourier transform
infrared spectrophotometry

10:38.604 --> 10:40.564
to compare the chemistry
between the factory specs

10:40.606 --> 10:41.637
and the link that failed.

10:41.732 --> 10:43.309
Is all this necessary?

10:43.859 --> 10:46.266
If I just came right out
and told you what I found,

10:46.361 --> 10:47.393
you would be bored.

10:47.487 --> 10:48.519
What'd you find?

10:48.614 --> 10:51.187
The chemical composition of the oxide
isn't the same.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.595
Couldn't that just be
from two different production batches?

10:53.619 --> 10:54.864
Possibly.

10:55.204 --> 10:58.537
- I'm sensing a "but."
- You are correct, O Great One.

10:58.790 --> 11:03.452
I used a scanning electron microscope
with an x-ray diffractive attachment

11:03.545 --> 11:05.787
and did a composition analysis.

11:07.883 --> 11:10.884
The one on the left is the D-link I got
from the manufacturer.

11:10.969 --> 11:13.211
The one on the right
is Lieutenant Johnson's.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.633
They're not the same.

11:14.723 --> 11:19.551
That's because one is steel
and the other is 66-3T6 aluminium.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.886
So the manufacturer makes the D-link
in both metals?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.772
Actually, they don't.

11:24.107 --> 11:26.563
- Then how do you explain that?
- Easy.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.688
Someone handmade a D-link
out of a much weaker metal

11:29.780 --> 11:32.734
and then swapped it
with Lieutenant Johnson's real one.

11:32.824 --> 11:35.150
- It wasn't an accident.
- Nope.

11:35.911 --> 11:37.654
It looks like murder.

11:45.636 --> 11:47.843
I know this is a difficult time.

11:47.930 --> 11:49.450
When your husband
brought his gear home,

11:49.474 --> 11:50.849
where did he keep it?

11:50.933 --> 11:55.263
Usually in the garage.
Sometimes he'd leave it in the car.

11:55.813 --> 11:58.020
He ever bring it in the house?

11:58.107 --> 11:59.138
Why?

11:59.609 --> 12:02.278
Someone may have tampered
with his equipment.

12:03.154 --> 12:04.352
Tampered?

12:05.198 --> 12:07.190
Why would anybody do that?

12:08.868 --> 12:09.947
Hi.

12:11.079 --> 12:14.163
I keep expecting him
to walk through that door.

12:20.004 --> 12:21.498
I'm so sorry.

12:23.174 --> 12:24.834
Take a look around, Kate.

12:24.926 --> 12:26.883
Tony, let's check out the garage.

12:32.391 --> 12:33.636
Nice car.

12:34.268 --> 12:36.510
It's not just a car, boss.

12:36.604 --> 12:40.222
This is a '66 Mustang.
Revolutionary in its day.

12:40.316 --> 12:43.602
You're not going to start giving me
all the vital stats on this car, are you?

12:43.694 --> 12:44.726
Thunderball...

12:44.821 --> 12:47.062
Let me rephrase that, DiNozzo.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.774
You're not going to give me
the vital stats on this car.

12:53.746 --> 12:56.700
If someone was gonna break in
to get at his gear,

12:56.791 --> 12:58.582
their choices were limited.

12:58.668 --> 13:00.043
Garage door,

13:00.753 --> 13:02.378
or the back door.

13:03.256 --> 13:04.584
Lock works.

13:05.424 --> 13:07.216
No sign of forced entry.

13:07.844 --> 13:09.836
Whoever switched his D-link...

13:11.514 --> 13:13.092
I don't think it was done here.

13:13.182 --> 13:15.590
Yeah, yeah, it does seem that way.

13:26.279 --> 13:28.355
- I'm sorry.
- My fault.

13:28.447 --> 13:30.773
No, hi. Hi, Larry Clannon.

13:31.325 --> 13:32.654
Kate Todd.

13:33.452 --> 13:36.619
Why, I thought I knew
most of Rick's friends. I...

13:37.540 --> 13:40.624
Actually, I'm with NCIS.
We're investigating his death.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.868
I thought it was an accident.

13:43.129 --> 13:45.121
Still need to investigate.

13:45.882 --> 13:48.088
- Right.
- How do you know Rick?

13:48.176 --> 13:52.220
Oh, God, we've been friends, well...
We were friends since high school.

13:52.305 --> 13:55.970
We played football together,
got in trouble together. We...

13:59.312 --> 14:01.637
I can't imagine life without him.

14:01.814 --> 14:03.308
Hello, Father.

14:03.983 --> 14:05.181
Hi, Edna.

14:09.989 --> 14:11.187
I'm a priest

14:11.866 --> 14:13.490
at St Matthews.

14:16.495 --> 14:17.610
Why no collar?

14:17.705 --> 14:19.863
I was out running errands
and I got the call.

14:19.957 --> 14:21.665
I just came right over.

14:22.501 --> 14:26.120
Rick was my best friend.
He's the reason I became a priest.

14:26.797 --> 14:27.829
How so?

14:27.924 --> 14:30.960
Well, when I was 19,
I was in a motorcycle accident.

14:31.177 --> 14:33.502
A priest with a motorcycle.
Sounds like a TV show.

14:33.596 --> 14:36.003
Right. I ended up in a coma.

14:36.098 --> 14:38.803
Rick would come sit with me
after school.

14:38.893 --> 14:43.140
Sometimes he would just talk to me
and other times he would pray.

14:44.273 --> 14:45.914
The doctors said that if I came out of it

14:45.983 --> 14:48.854
I would end up in a vegetative state,
but...

14:50.071 --> 14:52.692
- It was a miracle.
- Not according to Rick.

14:53.199 --> 14:56.650
Rick said it was because he had juice
with the man upstairs.

14:58.329 --> 15:00.737
You should come by church sometime.

15:00.831 --> 15:04.035
Yeah, I get a cash bonus
for every person past a certain number.

15:04.126 --> 15:05.289
You do?

15:08.547 --> 15:11.217
I'm sorry, I'm not used to a priest
with a sense of humour.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.379
Right.

15:13.219 --> 15:15.544
Well, the times, they are a-changing.

15:16.931 --> 15:18.674
They certainly are.

15:22.561 --> 15:24.720
Who had access to your climbing gear?

15:24.814 --> 15:25.845
That depends.

15:25.940 --> 15:28.265
Lines and harnesses
are usually kept in a rope locker.

15:28.359 --> 15:30.517
- What about D-links?
- Not a controlled item.

15:30.611 --> 15:33.446
Most of my men take their personal gear
like that home with them.

15:33.531 --> 15:35.571
Anyone in the unit
could've had access to Johnson's?

15:35.616 --> 15:36.647
I suppose so.

15:36.742 --> 15:38.984
How many men
in your unit, Commander?

15:40.413 --> 15:42.204
That information's classified,
Agent Gibbs.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.997
- Commander Rainer.
- I'll be right back.

15:49.588 --> 15:52.542
Enough ammo here
to take over a small country.

15:52.633 --> 15:53.962
How small?

15:55.594 --> 15:56.923
Open it up.

16:02.685 --> 16:04.594
I appreciate that you have a job to do.

16:04.687 --> 16:07.522
As far as we're concerned,
this was a training accident.

16:07.606 --> 16:09.848
What if I was to tell you it wasn't?

16:13.112 --> 16:16.029
I was there, Agent Gibbs.
I saw Johnson's D-link.

16:16.115 --> 16:17.609
It was broken.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.657
What you saw was a fake.

16:20.161 --> 16:22.449
Someone substituted
Lieutenant Johnson's D-link

16:22.538 --> 16:24.329
with one made from inferior metal.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.491
Metal that was designed to fail.

16:29.211 --> 16:30.409
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

16:30.504 --> 16:31.999
- Security badges.
- Yes, sir.

16:32.089 --> 16:33.168
Anything you see or hear

16:33.257 --> 16:35.415
is to be considered classified
at the highest level.

16:35.509 --> 16:38.069
I'll assist you in any way I can
as long as it doesn't compromise

16:38.095 --> 16:39.990
- our primary mission.
- Which you can't tell us.

16:40.014 --> 16:42.801
I will tell you it's absolutely vital
to national security.

16:42.892 --> 16:44.452
Not much help
in a murder investigation.

16:44.477 --> 16:47.513
Well, it's the best I can do.
I got a backup team waiting.

16:47.605 --> 16:50.083
If there's someone deliberately trying
to sabotage this mission,

16:50.107 --> 16:51.186
I need to know.

16:51.275 --> 16:52.769
Get Admiral Barnes on a secure line.

16:52.860 --> 16:55.268
Tell him Task Force X-ray
may have been compromised.

16:55.363 --> 16:56.477
Yes, sir.

16:56.572 --> 16:58.925
Who else knew Johnson
was going to be rappelling last night?

16:58.949 --> 17:00.194
No one outside this unit.

17:00.284 --> 17:02.429
My men have been in total isolation
for the past 10 days,

17:02.453 --> 17:03.813
no contact with the outside world.

17:03.871 --> 17:05.116
Any security breaches?

17:05.205 --> 17:08.704
One Petty Officer made
a few unauthorised calls to his wife.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.284
- He was in Johnson's squad?
- He was.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.170
Petty Officer Vengal.

17:13.381 --> 17:16.215
Lieutenant Johnson counselled him
on following orders.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.384
- What kind of a sailor is Vengal?
- Young, headstrong.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.720
- Likes to be the centre of attention.
- Basically, a SEAL.

17:23.516 --> 17:26.719
Johnson rode him pretty hard,
but that was his job.

17:27.478 --> 17:28.806
I'll need to talk to him,

17:28.896 --> 17:31.221
as well as anyone else
on Johnson's team.

17:31.315 --> 17:34.399
Not a problem. They're no longer
the primary team on the mission.

17:34.485 --> 17:36.312
What's our time frame here?

17:39.281 --> 17:41.440
We're inside a 38-hour window.

17:41.534 --> 17:45.578
If you don't find out what happened
by then, we scrub the mission.

17:47.540 --> 17:50.113
Tony, get with whoever's in charge
of the climbing gear.

17:50.209 --> 17:52.747
I want every rope,
D-link and harness checked.

17:52.837 --> 17:54.082
You got it, boss.

17:54.171 --> 17:57.587
I'll escort Agent DiNozzo.
Bravo Team's bunked in here.

18:00.761 --> 18:04.344
How'd you get along with
your lieutenant, Petty Officer Vengal?

18:05.516 --> 18:07.509
He was a good SEAL, sir.

18:08.436 --> 18:10.143
But you didn't like him.

18:10.604 --> 18:14.602
- We had different styles, ma'am.
- His style was to ride your ass.

18:15.943 --> 18:17.188
Yes, sir.

18:17.445 --> 18:20.611
- Why'd you breach security?
- Excuse me, sir?

18:20.990 --> 18:22.567
You called your wife.

18:23.451 --> 18:24.482
Why?

18:24.577 --> 18:28.111
She's pregnant.
I wanted to check up on her, ma'am.

18:29.165 --> 18:32.783
I checked your service record.
Lieutenant Johnson wrote you up

18:32.877 --> 18:34.585
for an unauthorised absence
two weeks ago.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.129
I had to take my wife to the doctor.

18:36.213 --> 18:39.048
Why are you asking me
about the lieutenant?

18:41.385 --> 18:44.386
Because we're looking for the man
who murdered him.

19:03.407 --> 19:06.990
Lieutenant Johnson's last two calls
were made while in isolation.

19:07.077 --> 19:08.821
Both were to Father Clannon.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.455
The lieutenant writes up Vengal

19:10.539 --> 19:12.331
for calling his pregnant wife
during lockdown

19:12.416 --> 19:13.745
then makes two calls himself?

19:13.834 --> 19:15.661
It doesn't make sense.

19:15.753 --> 19:17.128
Agent Gibbs.

19:18.005 --> 19:21.291
Agent Kramer, CIA.
Is there some place we can talk?

19:23.135 --> 19:24.214
Yeah.

19:25.596 --> 19:27.339
How about right here?

19:29.308 --> 19:32.344
Whatever you say to me,
you can say to my team.

19:33.854 --> 19:34.969
Okay.

19:35.272 --> 19:38.024
Your investigation
into Lieutenant Johnson's death

19:38.108 --> 19:39.900
is very important to us.

19:39.985 --> 19:41.361
Yeah? Why's that?

19:41.445 --> 19:43.983
The SEALs are part
of a multiagency task force

19:44.073 --> 19:46.315
that's been training
for a very specific mission.

19:46.408 --> 19:47.844
Which you're not going to tell me about.

19:47.868 --> 19:50.869
Well, you'd have to be read into the
programme and we don't have the time.

19:50.955 --> 19:53.706
And you think that someone
inside this task force

19:53.791 --> 19:55.451
tampered with Johnson's equipment.

19:55.543 --> 19:56.741
I'm very concerned.

19:56.835 --> 19:58.793
There's an initial vetting process
for SEALs.

19:58.879 --> 20:01.251
And for this mission,
they were further vetted by the CIA.

20:01.340 --> 20:02.692
If they've gone through all that...

20:02.716 --> 20:05.634
Then we're dealing with someone
who's very clever.

20:06.095 --> 20:09.546
In 34 hours,
a C-141 will be fuelled and ready to go.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.511
We need to know who swapped
that D-link out and why...

20:12.601 --> 20:15.638
Otherwise, four months of planning
will go out the window.

20:15.729 --> 20:19.644
I'll tell you everything that we know
as long as you do the same.

20:19.733 --> 20:22.604
- Sure. Sounds good to me.
- Let me give you this.

20:24.113 --> 20:27.030
- Abs, what's up?
- Something very unexpected.

20:28.284 --> 20:29.612
He's okay.

20:30.411 --> 20:34.029
I ran the print off Johnson's D-link
through the military database.

20:34.123 --> 20:35.368
No match.

20:35.499 --> 20:37.456
Yeah, what's the unexpected part?

20:37.543 --> 20:40.793
When I ran it through
the criminal database, I got a hit.

20:40.879 --> 20:43.453
- Anyone we know?
- Absolutely.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.460
Lieutenant Johnson's wife.

21:01.633 --> 21:04.587
She was 18 when she was arrested
for joyriding.

21:04.678 --> 21:07.299
Joyriding. Sounds so much better
than grand theft auto.

21:07.389 --> 21:09.110
There's something almost spiritual
about it.

21:09.182 --> 21:11.009
She said she didn't know
the car was stolen.

21:11.101 --> 21:12.912
Her boyfriend said he borrowed it
from a friend.

21:12.936 --> 21:15.641
The old blame-it-on-the-boyfriend
excuse. One of the classics.

21:15.731 --> 21:18.222
- That's usually who is to blame.
- Anything else?

21:18.316 --> 21:19.894
- I was saving the best for last.
- Why?

21:19.985 --> 21:21.942
Denise Johnson works
at a jewellery store.

21:22.029 --> 21:23.820
She makes custom metal jewellery.

21:23.905 --> 21:26.313
And yesterday when I was in the den
I saw some things

21:26.408 --> 21:28.886
that made it seem like Johnson
may have been sleeping in there.

21:28.910 --> 21:31.828
- What kind of things?
- Alarm clock, pillow, blanket.

21:31.913 --> 21:34.998
Something's really been bothering me.
What kind of sick and twisted logic

21:35.083 --> 21:38.203
makes you think the boyfriend
is always to blame, huh?

21:42.007 --> 21:44.130
Could we just have a minute?

21:44.509 --> 21:46.502
Of course my fingerprints
were on there.

21:46.595 --> 21:49.512
I mean, you'd find my fingerprints
on almost anything Rick owned

21:49.598 --> 21:51.923
except maybe his hunting rifles.

21:52.017 --> 21:53.511
We had to ask.

21:54.186 --> 21:56.855
You're not married, are you,
Agent Todd?

21:59.024 --> 22:00.103
No.

22:00.192 --> 22:02.730
Well, a lot of husbands leave a trail
when they come home.

22:02.819 --> 22:05.191
I was constantly picking up after him.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.194
How was your relationship
with your husband?

22:08.283 --> 22:09.658
It was fine.

22:10.869 --> 22:13.027
He wasn't sleeping in the den?

22:15.749 --> 22:18.869
We had our problems,
like any married couple.

22:19.544 --> 22:22.249
- What were they?
- None of your business.

22:22.714 --> 22:24.707
I'm sorry if we upset you.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.757
What were you expecting?

22:26.968 --> 22:30.717
You come into my home
and basically accuse me

22:30.806 --> 22:33.012
of having something to do
with my husband's death.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.092
We're just trying
to tie up any loose ends.

22:35.185 --> 22:36.666
Your fingerprints were on the D-link,

22:36.728 --> 22:39.563
we came,
we're not accusing you of anything.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.473
Did your husband have a computer?

22:42.859 --> 22:44.484
We have a laptop.

22:47.656 --> 22:50.526
- Her explanation made sense.
- Doesn't mean she isn't guilty.

22:50.617 --> 22:52.823
Do you honestly think
she had anything to do with it?

22:52.911 --> 22:54.951
I've seen a single mother
drown her children

22:55.038 --> 22:57.244
because her new boyfriend
didn't like them.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.123
Nothing surprises me.

23:01.419 --> 23:04.420
Interesting how she pegged you
for unmarried.

23:12.764 --> 23:14.591
Here's a page 13
Lieutenant Johnson wrote

23:14.683 --> 23:17.138
after Petty Officer Vengal
got into a fight in town.

23:17.227 --> 23:19.932
He said he didn't start the fight,
he was just protecting himself.

23:20.021 --> 23:22.773
- It's not in Vengal's service report.
- There's more.

23:22.858 --> 23:24.601
This is from an undated fitness report.

23:24.693 --> 23:26.353
Under comments,
Lieutenant Johnson wrote,

23:26.444 --> 23:28.686
"Though Petty Officer Vengal
is an outstanding sailor,

23:28.780 --> 23:31.105
"and no doubt will make
a fine Petty Officer First Class,

23:31.199 --> 23:33.488
"at this point
I think he needs a little seasoning

23:33.577 --> 23:36.068
"and I am not recommending him
for promotion."

23:36.163 --> 23:37.989
Also not in his service report.

23:38.081 --> 23:40.287
So, how can that be?

23:40.458 --> 23:42.747
Rainer said Johnson rode Vengal
pretty hard.

23:42.836 --> 23:45.327
My guess is that was part
of his carrot-and-stick approach.

23:45.422 --> 23:48.458
He wrote the page 13,
showed it to Vengal.

23:48.550 --> 23:51.835
- But never formally filed it.
- So if the guy cleaned up his act,

23:51.928 --> 23:54.365
then Johnson would just toss
the page 13 like it never existed.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.701
Okay, why did Johnson include
the counselling sheet he wrote

23:56.725 --> 23:57.756
when Vengal was late?

23:57.851 --> 24:01.101
That's just a slap on the wrist.
Page 13 is serious.

24:01.313 --> 24:02.344
Anything else?

24:02.439 --> 24:06.057
No. Paid the bills,
sent e-mails to friends, normal stuff.

24:09.154 --> 24:11.823
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- You seem bothered.

24:11.907 --> 24:14.148
That was Mrs Vengal's doctor.

24:14.826 --> 24:16.819
Petty Officer Vengal did take her
to see him

24:16.912 --> 24:19.533
but not on the day
that he told Lieutenant Johnson he did.

24:19.623 --> 24:21.781
- He lied.
- Get Vengal in here.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.832
Boss, I'm not sure those guys
are going to let...

24:23.919 --> 24:25.958
- Convince him, Tony.
- Okay.

24:29.049 --> 24:31.753
I was down in the evidence locker
looking for a fingerprint kit

24:31.843 --> 24:33.883
and this started vibrating.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.839
- Freaked me out.
- Thanks, Abs.

24:37.933 --> 24:39.343
Thanks, Abs.

24:48.985 --> 24:51.025
Lieutenant Johnson got a text message.

24:51.112 --> 24:52.441
"Why weren't you there?"

24:52.530 --> 24:53.906
Who sent it?

24:55.367 --> 24:56.446
This is weird.

24:56.534 --> 24:59.370
It's an e-mail message
forwarded from an internet account

24:59.454 --> 25:01.182
that shows up as a text message
on his cell phone.

25:01.206 --> 25:04.824
- English, Kate.
- Okay, I can set up my internet account

25:04.918 --> 25:07.753
so that if somebody e-mails me
on my computer and I'm not there,

25:07.837 --> 25:10.293
the e-mail will automatically
be forwarded to my cell phone.

25:10.382 --> 25:11.627
What's the weird part?

25:11.716 --> 25:13.875
The e-mail account
that this was forwarded from

25:13.969 --> 25:17.420
is Dave Smith at Concealmail. Com.

25:17.514 --> 25:20.515
- That's not Johnson's e-mail address.
- You're sure?

25:21.142 --> 25:22.423
Let me rephrase that.

25:22.519 --> 25:25.555
It's not Lieutenant Johnson's
e-mail account on his home computer.

25:25.647 --> 25:28.138
But he could've opened an account
on another computer.

25:28.233 --> 25:30.309
- Under an assumed name?
- Anybody can.

25:30.402 --> 25:32.690
But why would somebody
with a top security clearance

25:32.779 --> 25:35.235
have an e-mail account
under an assumed name?

25:35.323 --> 25:37.565
What if I wanted
to get into that account?

25:37.659 --> 25:39.201
Get a search warrant for the servers.

25:39.286 --> 25:41.446
We don't have time for a warrant.
What's a quicker way?

25:41.496 --> 25:43.121
Hack into the servers.

25:45.709 --> 25:47.500
I can't believe I just said that.

25:47.585 --> 25:50.919
I would've never suggested that
before I started working here.

25:51.006 --> 25:52.500
You're welcome.

25:52.716 --> 25:55.088
Get McGee over here.
Have him work with Abby.

25:55.176 --> 25:57.584
Tell him to do whatever it takes
to get that information.

25:57.679 --> 25:58.710
I...

25:59.431 --> 26:02.716
- Are you sure we need to do that?
- You have a problem with McGee?

26:02.809 --> 26:03.924
Not me.

26:04.019 --> 26:06.510
Well, then tell him
to get his butt over here.

26:06.604 --> 26:10.602
When you're done with that, we're
going to pay a visit to Father Clannon.

26:22.370 --> 26:25.205
I guess I was more persuasive
than I thought.

26:25.290 --> 26:28.291
Actually, I'm here in an official capacity,
not to go to confession.

26:28.376 --> 26:30.313
Well, you can always kill two birds
with one stone.

26:30.337 --> 26:31.617
I'm hearing them in 15 minutes.

26:31.713 --> 26:33.919
- You should be in sales.
- I am.

26:34.299 --> 26:35.497
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

26:35.592 --> 26:37.631
- Hi, I think I saw you at Denise's house.
- Yeah.

26:37.719 --> 26:39.196
- Welcome to St Matthews.
- Thank you.

26:39.220 --> 26:41.861
Do you mind if we ask you a few
questions about Lieutenant Johnson?

26:41.931 --> 26:43.924
No. Please, go right ahead.

26:44.017 --> 26:46.175
His death wasn't an accident.

26:46.519 --> 26:50.268
Someone switched a piece of his
equipment with an inferior version.

26:50.899 --> 26:53.650
That's what broke
when he was rappelling down the cliff.

26:53.735 --> 26:57.270
Lieutenant Johnson ever tell you
anything that might be able to help us?

26:57.364 --> 26:59.819
Rick and I talked about many things.

27:00.492 --> 27:03.243
As a priest,
I can't break the seal of confession.

27:03.328 --> 27:05.451
So he confessed something
you can't talk about.

27:05.538 --> 27:08.409
- No, I didn't say that.
- Okay, okay.

27:09.376 --> 27:13.243
What about the two phone calls
he made to you just before he died?

27:15.006 --> 27:17.331
Were you in the service, Agent Gibbs?

27:17.926 --> 27:19.005
Marines.

27:19.094 --> 27:21.170
Semper Fidelis. Always faithful.

27:21.262 --> 27:23.338
- That was your motto, your code?
- Yes, it is.

27:23.431 --> 27:24.700
And did you ever have circumstances

27:24.724 --> 27:27.559
that allowed you
to turn your back on that code?

27:31.272 --> 27:34.724
I guess there's no way we could phrase
the question to allow you to answer it.

27:34.818 --> 27:36.395
No, there's not.

27:36.861 --> 27:39.068
Are you sure you won't stick around?

27:39.989 --> 27:41.567
Maybe next time.

27:43.535 --> 27:44.863
Very good.

27:45.870 --> 27:47.033
Thanks.

28:16.734 --> 28:18.312
Who was that for?

28:30.957 --> 28:32.036
Abby.

28:33.293 --> 28:34.455
McGee.

28:34.669 --> 28:37.955
- Gibbs said you needed my help.
- I don't need your help.

28:38.047 --> 28:41.915
- He just asked you to help me.
- Okay. What am I helping you do?

28:42.469 --> 28:44.378
Hack into ISP servers.

28:44.471 --> 28:47.804
We have to get into an e-mail account
and download the activity.

28:47.891 --> 28:51.010
- What are we looking for?
- Just anything that's hinky.

28:51.769 --> 28:52.932
Why do you use that word?

28:53.021 --> 28:54.681
- What word?
- Hinky. It's a made-up word.

28:54.772 --> 28:57.228
- All words are made-up words.
- Well, I think it's stupid.

28:57.317 --> 28:58.836
Well, maybe I shouldn't
say anything then.

28:58.860 --> 28:59.939
- Fine.
- Fine.

29:00.028 --> 29:01.486
- Good.
- Great.

29:24.844 --> 29:27.300
Is there any reason
why you couldn't do this at Little Creek?

29:27.388 --> 29:30.674
Evidence pertinent to the investigation
is all here.

29:31.726 --> 29:32.805
Okay.

29:33.186 --> 29:34.265
Okay.

29:37.273 --> 29:39.598
Turn that off. We're not taping this.

29:44.447 --> 29:46.107
Go ahead. Shut it down.

29:52.497 --> 29:55.866
Your future in the Navy is clear.
You don't have one.

29:56.334 --> 29:59.370
The question is,
do you have any future at all?

30:01.673 --> 30:03.582
You don't have anything to say?

30:03.675 --> 30:05.548
Didn't hear a question in there, sir.

30:05.635 --> 30:08.671
Well, okay, then, Petty Officer,
here's a question.

30:11.599 --> 30:14.090
Why did you lie about taking your wife
to the doctor?

30:14.185 --> 30:16.344
I do take my wife to the doctor.
She's pregnant.

30:16.437 --> 30:17.635
I'm talking about April 28.

30:17.730 --> 30:19.640
- You remember that date?
- No, sir.

30:19.732 --> 30:22.058
Well, here, let me refresh your memory.

30:22.151 --> 30:24.310
You were late for a squad meeting.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.815
Your excuse was
taking your wife to the doctor.

30:27.991 --> 30:30.316
Lieutenant Johnson wrote you up.

30:37.834 --> 30:40.123
Want to reconsider your answer?

30:41.546 --> 30:44.997
I went to see a doctor off base
for a medical problem.

30:54.851 --> 30:58.516
- What sort of medical problem?
- Inner ear infection.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.173
They would've yanked you
from the mission if they knew that.

31:01.232 --> 31:04.683
- Could've worked through it.
- Yeah, maybe.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.354
But you would have been putting
everyone else at risk.

31:08.448 --> 31:11.567
- I had it under control.
- What happened on the cliff?

31:11.951 --> 31:13.695
I told you what happened.

31:14.370 --> 31:17.205
Your track record for the truth
is unimpressive.

31:18.583 --> 31:19.697
We were inserted by Huey.

31:21.794 --> 31:24.795
We secured our ropes,
went down in pairs.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.874
Lieutenant Johnson's D-link snapped.

31:31.763 --> 31:32.877
End of story.

31:32.972 --> 31:35.344
You had access
to Lieutenant Johnson's gear?

31:35.433 --> 31:36.808
So did everyone in the unit.

31:36.893 --> 31:40.593
Yeah, but you were the only one
that Johnson was writing up.

31:41.481 --> 31:43.972
He wasn't recommending you
for promotion.

31:45.443 --> 31:49.061
He made multiple page 13 entries
that only you knew about.

31:50.740 --> 31:52.733
Why would I kill Lieutenant Johnson?

31:52.825 --> 31:55.495
If he dies,
the whole squad's off the mission.

31:56.245 --> 31:59.412
I risked my career
so I could stay on the mission.

32:11.177 --> 32:13.466
Gibbs, Kramer. What's the status?

32:13.554 --> 32:15.677
- No change.
- Team's in the air.

32:15.765 --> 32:18.007
Touchdown is scheduled in eight hours.

32:18.101 --> 32:20.971
If we don't have a definitive answer
by then, the mission is scrubbed.

32:21.062 --> 32:22.307
That's not gonna happen.

32:22.397 --> 32:24.021
Well, I hope you're right.

32:24.107 --> 32:25.980
It's a hostage rescue situation.

32:26.067 --> 32:29.352
Opportunities like this
don't come along very often.

32:31.614 --> 32:32.943
All right.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.735
Let's pretend we don't know anything.

32:35.827 --> 32:39.030
- Not much of a stretch.
- Start from the beginning.

32:39.706 --> 32:43.537
Someone substituted a phoney D-link
for Lieutenant Johnson's real one.

32:43.626 --> 32:44.705
When?

32:44.919 --> 32:47.706
They had a rappelling exercise
two weeks before without a problem.

32:47.797 --> 32:49.024
It was in that two-week window.

32:49.048 --> 32:51.718
Well, nine days out of the two-week
period, they were in isolation.

32:51.801 --> 32:53.959
If someone outside the unit
pulled the switch,

32:54.053 --> 32:55.962
they had a five-day period to do it.

32:56.055 --> 32:57.964
Who had the best opportunity?

32:58.057 --> 33:00.548
- The wife.
- What about the best friend, Clannon?

33:00.643 --> 33:02.968
- Gibbs, he's a priest.
- Yeah. So?

33:03.563 --> 33:05.721
Okay, he had opportunity, but no motive.

33:05.815 --> 33:08.520
That we know of.
What was the wife's motive?

33:08.609 --> 33:10.851
Well, they were sleeping
in different bedrooms.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.863
Would indicate they were arguing
about something.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.941
You know something about that.

33:17.368 --> 33:18.743
Sorry, boss.

33:21.789 --> 33:23.698
Who had the skill to make a D-link?

33:23.791 --> 33:25.894
The wife made metal jewellery.
She could make a D-link.

33:25.918 --> 33:28.540
Wife wasn't having an affair
with someone at the jewellery store?

33:28.629 --> 33:29.709
Jealous husband?

33:29.797 --> 33:32.798
Our investigation
indicates nothing like that.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.876
- Financial?
- Normal.

33:34.969 --> 33:38.219
Motive, method, opportunity.
The wife had all three.

33:38.306 --> 33:39.848
Ice cream's here.

33:39.932 --> 33:42.221
Thank God! I'm starving.

33:44.061 --> 33:45.260
I can wait.

33:45.354 --> 33:47.624
Duck, what are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

33:47.648 --> 33:50.318
How could I be at home
in my warm and comfortable bed

33:50.401 --> 33:52.061
knowing my brethren were here,

33:52.153 --> 33:54.858
toiling away
in the name of national security.

33:54.947 --> 33:56.062
Couldn't sleep, huh?

33:56.157 --> 33:58.233
- Not a wink.
- Neighbours again?

33:58.326 --> 34:01.825
Or as I like to refer to them,
the devil's spawn.

34:01.913 --> 34:03.573
Well, it's good to see you, Duck.

34:03.664 --> 34:05.408
We could use a new pair of eyes
around here.

34:05.500 --> 34:09.331
I'm afraid the freshness date
on my eyes expired a while back.

34:09.545 --> 34:12.416
However, I do have corrective lenses.

34:18.513 --> 34:22.380
- Any luck with the port scan?
- Still trying to find an opening.

34:24.768 --> 34:26.975
You going after the sockets
or the firewall itself?

34:27.063 --> 34:30.313
- Firewall. You?
- Connected. Trying to authenticate.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.442
APG or keystroke capture?

34:32.527 --> 34:35.563
I tried APG, but the admin had limits
on how many times you could go in.

34:35.655 --> 34:36.935
How you gonna cover your tracks?

34:37.031 --> 34:39.176
Putting in a programme bot
which will call another host,

34:39.199 --> 34:40.574
infect it with a similar bot...

34:40.659 --> 34:43.495
- And so on and so on and so on.
- Until it reaches the remote.

34:43.579 --> 34:46.179
- And afterwards, it'll self-destruct?
- Yeah, but before it does,

34:46.248 --> 34:48.409
the bot knows what files to delete
from the host system

34:48.458 --> 34:50.452
so it can delete the logs.

34:52.839 --> 34:54.831
- Look, I'm...
- I'm sorry...

34:55.216 --> 34:57.374
- Go ahead.
- No, you go ahead.

34:59.971 --> 35:02.212
I'm sorry that I got upset at you.

35:02.306 --> 35:04.263
It's okay. I understand.

35:04.475 --> 35:06.017
You're insecure.

35:07.353 --> 35:10.473
- You think I'm insecure?
- Well, in a cute way.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.069
I'm not insecure.
What makes you think I'm insecure?

35:15.152 --> 35:18.356
That whole, "Where is
our relationship going?" thing.

35:18.447 --> 35:21.069
So it's insecure to want to know
the status of your relationship

35:21.158 --> 35:23.032
when one of the people
in that relationship

35:23.119 --> 35:24.827
can't accurately communicate
her feelings?

35:24.912 --> 35:25.943
Yes.

35:28.374 --> 35:30.995
Okay, I guess my poem
didn't mean anything then.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.663
No, I loved your poem.

35:33.004 --> 35:34.664
- You did?
- Of course I did.

35:34.755 --> 35:36.665
- Which part did you like?
- All of it.

35:36.757 --> 35:38.584
Even the finger snaps?

35:39.010 --> 35:41.002
Especially the finger snaps.

35:49.145 --> 35:50.972
Looks like we're back to square one.

35:51.063 --> 35:53.021
Well, I don't seem to have been
much help.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.352
Well, that's okay, Duck.

35:54.442 --> 35:56.933
DiNozzo there
sure enjoyed the ice cream.

35:57.695 --> 36:01.278
- Well, if I have any brainstorms...
- Yeah, we'll be here.

36:02.533 --> 36:05.736
I wish I had a better idea
of how all this rappelling stuff worked.

36:05.828 --> 36:09.197
You know, might be easier to figure out
what happened.

36:09.290 --> 36:12.160
I have kind of a crazy idea.

36:13.252 --> 36:16.455
Those are never comforting words
coming from you.

36:21.552 --> 36:22.631
What?

36:23.554 --> 36:25.677
- No. No way.
- You'll do fine.

36:26.891 --> 36:30.758
All right, push this down,
clamp it on to your harness like that.

36:30.853 --> 36:31.884
There you go.

36:31.979 --> 36:35.064
Okay, remind me. This is gonna help us
solve the case again because...

36:35.149 --> 36:36.394
It's fun?

36:36.692 --> 36:39.183
You want to understand what happened.

36:39.987 --> 36:42.063
This is how you understand.

36:45.368 --> 36:46.530
Okay.

36:46.911 --> 36:49.034
You used to protect the President?

36:49.121 --> 36:51.161
I've got to check your harness.

36:53.376 --> 36:54.704
Turn around.

36:55.252 --> 36:57.126
- God.
- How's that feel?

36:59.548 --> 37:02.170
- Like I'm about to throw up.
- Face me.

37:05.596 --> 37:08.383
Through. DiNozzo, you're on belay.

37:09.308 --> 37:13.057
- Don't worry, Kate. I got your back.
- Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of, Tony.

37:13.145 --> 37:14.225
Okay.

37:15.898 --> 37:17.772
Guide hand, right here.

37:17.858 --> 37:19.234
Brake hand.

37:19.402 --> 37:21.311
If you want to stop, clamp down on this.

37:21.404 --> 37:24.488
Put your thumb
right at the centre of your butt.

37:24.573 --> 37:27.859
- All set down here, boss.
- Remember what I told you.

37:28.035 --> 37:30.740
- Todd on rappel.
- DiNozzo on belay.

37:31.580 --> 37:32.956
Are you ready?

37:33.040 --> 37:37.370
You know, Gibbs, I kind of think
I got the gist of it now. It's fine...

37:38.879 --> 37:40.587
You're doing great.

37:46.470 --> 37:47.585
Cool.

37:48.597 --> 37:51.171
See? Now you know what it feels like.

37:55.271 --> 37:56.385
What?

38:00.109 --> 38:02.682
The fake D-link is lighter
than the real one.

38:02.778 --> 38:03.857
Okay.

38:03.988 --> 38:08.032
Johnson was an experienced climber.
Why didn't he notice the difference?

38:08.409 --> 38:11.244
Get out of that.
We have less than an hour.

38:14.331 --> 38:16.289
No, no, you have to change the bit
to "on."

38:16.375 --> 38:17.454
I know, I know.

38:17.543 --> 38:19.121
Embed the BIOS, then flash the BIOS.

38:19.211 --> 38:21.932
We can have it run away into memory
and link everywhere on the system

38:22.006 --> 38:23.650
from there.
Even if they kill it in memory...

38:23.674 --> 38:25.955
They have to take it one step further
and kill it in BIOS.

38:26.010 --> 38:27.801
- Yes, we are kicking ass.
- Yes, we are.

38:27.887 --> 38:30.722
- Can you type any faster?
- Not unless I grow another hand.

38:30.806 --> 38:32.217
Here, let me.

38:46.572 --> 38:49.110
Right here in front of us the whole time.

38:49.658 --> 38:53.526
- Lathe, vise, acetylene torch.
- Everything you need to make a D-link.

38:53.621 --> 38:54.996
Yeah. Gibbs.

38:55.956 --> 38:58.494
You got the e-mails? What'd they say?

38:58.584 --> 39:00.162
Love letters? To who?

39:04.090 --> 39:07.174
Abby and McGee cracked
Johnson's secret e-mail account.

39:07.259 --> 39:08.884
We got our answer.

39:11.055 --> 39:14.091
I suspected something
a couple years ago.

39:15.017 --> 39:17.306
I'm not sure what I saw.

39:17.394 --> 39:21.095
It's not the type of thing
a woman thinks about her husband.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.894
How did you find out?

39:24.276 --> 39:27.941
Two weeks ago, Rick told me he was
going quail hunting for the weekend.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.821
Which wasn't unusual, except...

39:29.907 --> 39:32.778
You knew that it wasn't
quail hunting season.

39:33.202 --> 39:34.400
I knew.

39:35.621 --> 39:38.326
He had once told me
about a GPS device,

39:38.415 --> 39:40.704
the SEALs use for surveillance.

39:40.918 --> 39:44.252
I bought something similar online,
and I hid it in his car.

39:45.214 --> 39:47.622
He drove to downtown Baltimore.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.715
His car didn't move for two days.

39:53.055 --> 39:55.213
I saw Rick come out with him.

39:56.225 --> 39:57.636
They hugged.

39:57.977 --> 40:01.393
He watched Rick leave,
waved goodbye.

40:04.191 --> 40:06.350
You want to hear something funny?

40:07.695 --> 40:10.102
I was hoping it was another woman.

40:10.698 --> 40:12.690
What happened after that?

40:14.034 --> 40:15.410
I confronted him.

40:16.495 --> 40:20.742
He didn't try to deny it.
I guess he felt relieved.

40:22.126 --> 40:23.668
He said he had an e-mail account

40:23.752 --> 40:26.540
and that's how
he communicated with his...

40:29.967 --> 40:32.423
I told him he had to make a choice.

40:33.345 --> 40:35.468
Why didn't you tell us that?

40:36.682 --> 40:39.849
I didn't want to embarrass his friends,
his family...

40:40.853 --> 40:43.178
I mean, Rick was very religious.

40:44.148 --> 40:48.395
And I was hoping that didn't have
anything to do with his death.

40:50.070 --> 40:52.063
Yeah, but you knew it did.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.319
Yeah.

40:55.284 --> 40:57.609
I saw him working on his D-link.

41:01.624 --> 41:03.949
Rick dedicated his life to the Navy.

41:04.043 --> 41:07.577
Five generations of his family
have served honourably.

41:08.505 --> 41:11.079
But maybe if I hadn't confronted him...

41:14.303 --> 41:16.011
I wake up every morning

41:16.096 --> 41:18.255
and I can't stand to look at myself
in the mirror.

41:18.349 --> 41:20.425
I mean, why couldn't he tell me?

41:26.941 --> 41:28.020
Yeah. Gibbs.

41:28.108 --> 41:31.026
Ten minutes from touchdown.
We need an answer.

41:31.111 --> 41:33.104
It was suicide. You're good to go.

41:33.197 --> 41:35.106
Thank you, Agent Gibbs.

41:41.997 --> 41:43.990
- See you next week.
- See you next week.

41:44.083 --> 41:45.114
Bye.

41:45.876 --> 41:47.952
- See you next week.
- You bet.

41:51.799 --> 41:54.669
- I enjoyed your sermon.
- Because I worked in Mel Gibson?

41:54.760 --> 41:56.302
It didn't hurt.

41:57.638 --> 42:00.508
I realised that in the midst
of all the things that were going on,

42:00.599 --> 42:04.264
I never got to tell you how sorry I was
for your loss.

42:05.646 --> 42:08.219
He was the best man I have ever known.

42:08.941 --> 42:12.144
I just... I tried to help him
believe in who he was.

42:12.528 --> 42:15.363
And that may not be
within church doctrine,

42:15.447 --> 42:17.654
but I believe it's God's love.

42:18.993 --> 42:20.985
I feel like I failed him.

42:23.038 --> 42:24.414
You didn't.

42:26.667 --> 42:28.291
How can you know?

42:30.337 --> 42:31.796
I have faith.
