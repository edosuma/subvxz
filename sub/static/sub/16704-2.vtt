00:26.523 --> 00:28.023
Gene.

00:28.091 --> 00:29.958
Gene. Gene.

00:30.026 --> 00:30.959
What?

00:31.027 --> 00:31.994
Stop.

00:32.061 --> 00:33.695
Bob, no more
newspaper, please.

00:33.763 --> 00:35.797
My parents are gonna
be here any minute.

00:35.865 --> 00:36.899
I know.

00:36.966 --> 00:38.901
You know how
I know they're coming?

00:38.968 --> 00:41.703
Because you go into
a crazy cleaning
frenzy every time.

00:41.771 --> 00:44.506
It's like the way animals
freak out before
an earthquake.

00:44.574 --> 00:45.974
That's nice.
That's not true.

00:46.042 --> 00:47.442
She's spooked.

00:47.510 --> 00:49.011
Louise, you're gettin'
cereal everywhere.

00:49.078 --> 00:50.829
I'm having
a seizure!

00:50.897 --> 00:52.848
Put a wallet
in my mouth!

00:52.916 --> 00:53.982
It passed.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.351
Look at this place.
It's a disaster.

00:56.419 --> 00:57.819
You haven't even
fixed the leak yet.

00:57.887 --> 00:59.755
Come on.
Linda, the leak is contained.

00:59.822 --> 01:01.623
Bobby!
What?

01:01.691 --> 01:03.025
You barely notice those.

01:03.092 --> 01:04.092
Aah!

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
I'm ok.

01:05.227 --> 01:06.795
Trust me, bobby.

01:06.863 --> 01:09.498
My mother
will notice that our
ceiling is leaking.

01:09.566 --> 01:10.832
yeah, you're right.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.768
She will,
repeatedly and loudly.

01:12.835 --> 01:14.536
Just fix it, please.

01:14.604 --> 01:17.005
Be my all-american
fix-it man, bobby.

01:17.073 --> 01:19.474
Fine. I'll go up
to the attic and
fix the leak.

01:19.542 --> 01:21.510
But I also need
you and the kids
to work out

01:21.578 --> 01:23.078
Whose room my folks
are sleepin' in,

01:23.146 --> 01:25.130
Because I have to go
check the bathroom
for stray hairs.

01:25.198 --> 01:26.965
No one sheds
like this family.

01:27.033 --> 01:28.967
It's like a bunch
of chewbaccas.

01:29.035 --> 01:31.003
So where are grandma
and grandpa gonna sleep?

01:31.070 --> 01:32.437
Gene's room
smells like
farts.

01:32.505 --> 01:33.672
That makes sense.

01:33.740 --> 01:35.574
Great. Well, we'll put 'em
in there, then.

01:35.642 --> 01:37.509
Maybe they'll
leave sooner
when they smell farts.

01:37.577 --> 01:39.745
Yeah.
Gene can sleep
with me in my room

01:39.812 --> 01:42.180
As long as he doesn't
mind my night terrors.
Huh?

01:42.248 --> 01:45.217
Remember, you let me watch
"night of the living dead"
when I was 8,

01:45.285 --> 01:48.453
So now I wake up
every night standing
in the middle of my room,

01:48.521 --> 01:49.588
Scratching the air,
and kicking.

01:49.656 --> 01:51.490
Oh, good.
Wait. You still get those?

01:51.558 --> 01:53.225
Yeah. They're weirder now.
Oh, boy.

01:53.293 --> 01:55.827
I think my subconscious fears
and my budding sexuality

01:55.895 --> 01:57.062
Are getting
all mixed up.

01:57.130 --> 01:58.830
Ok, I... tina, I don't
want to hear it.

01:58.898 --> 02:00.799
So I think I'm being
attacked by zombies,

02:00.867 --> 02:03.135
And I start screaming,
"do you wanna make out?"

02:03.202 --> 02:05.037
And I make out with it.

02:05.905 --> 02:07.072
Hmm.

02:07.140 --> 02:09.124
I might just
bunk with gram
and gramps.

02:09.192 --> 02:10.525
Ok, enough.

02:10.592 --> 02:12.561
Gene, louise,
you sleep in tina's room.

02:12.629 --> 02:15.063
Tina, you're quarantined.
You sleep alone.

02:15.131 --> 02:17.165
We'll strap you down
or something.

02:17.233 --> 02:18.867
Leave my lips free.

02:20.203 --> 02:21.770
Hey. Hey!

02:21.838 --> 02:24.439
Gene, just 'cause
grandma and grandpa
are comin',

02:24.507 --> 02:26.708
Doesn't mean you're
gonna get out of
doin' homework.

02:26.776 --> 02:28.577
How far are you on
that history report?

02:28.645 --> 02:30.178
So far, I just
got the title...

02:30.246 --> 02:33.682
"history: A blast
from the past."

02:33.750 --> 02:35.684
Ok. After we get
my parents settled,

02:35.752 --> 02:38.287
Your father's gonna
help you with that.
Right, bob?

02:38.354 --> 02:39.821
Have it on my desk
by 5:00.

02:39.889 --> 02:42.557
I am not writing
your report for you.

02:42.625 --> 02:44.526
Hey! Ok, everybody,

02:44.594 --> 02:45.961
I have
an announcement to make.

02:46.029 --> 02:47.996
I am on a ladder.
Stop shaking it.

02:48.064 --> 02:50.532
I feel like I shouldn't
have to say that.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.834
Dad, why do you get
so mad when grandma gloria

02:52.902 --> 02:54.569
And grandpa al
come over to visit?

02:54.637 --> 02:55.771
Do you hate them?

02:55.838 --> 02:57.472
I don't hate them.
Just grandma.

02:57.540 --> 03:00.642
Or I don't hate her,
just the sound she makes

03:00.710 --> 03:02.878
And her voice and
the things she says.

03:02.945 --> 03:04.546
Agh!

03:04.614 --> 03:05.547
Al!

03:09.752 --> 03:10.852
Wanna hear
my impression of her?

03:10.920 --> 03:11.853
Yes.

03:11.921 --> 03:12.954
Al!

03:13.022 --> 03:15.023
Linda: I'm not
hearing this, right?

03:15.091 --> 03:17.559
Sorry. I mean,
she's your gram gram.

03:17.627 --> 03:18.560
We love her.

03:18.628 --> 03:19.928
we hate her.

03:20.797 --> 03:21.930
I fixed the leak!

03:21.998 --> 03:24.032
Good! Don't
stay up there
too long,

03:24.100 --> 03:26.802
'cause I wanna
sorta have
a nice visit

03:26.869 --> 03:28.337
Before we open
the restaurant!

03:28.404 --> 03:31.073
Uh, I mean,
almost done!

03:32.041 --> 03:33.809
Huh?

03:34.911 --> 03:36.111
Wow. This is amazing.

03:36.179 --> 03:38.113
Eh, whose room
am I behind?!

03:38.181 --> 03:39.114
Tina: Mine.

03:39.182 --> 03:40.349
Hi, tina.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.751
Are you in the wall
or in my horse poster?

03:42.819 --> 03:43.685
Please say,
"horse poster."

03:43.753 --> 03:45.620
I'm a horse.

03:45.688 --> 03:47.889
Oh, wait. I can
go sideways, too.

03:47.957 --> 03:49.191
Are you in
another dimension?

03:49.258 --> 03:51.993
Do you see
a lion or a witch
or a wardrobe?

03:52.061 --> 03:53.829
A what?

03:53.896 --> 03:56.798
A lion, a witch,
or a wardrobe!

03:56.866 --> 03:58.033
Why are you
saying that, gene?

03:58.101 --> 03:59.701
It's a book.

03:59.769 --> 04:01.169
Oh, right, right.
A kid's book. Yeah.

04:01.237 --> 04:02.904
Yeah, by salman rushdie.

04:02.972 --> 04:04.539
It's not by
salman rushdie.

04:04.607 --> 04:05.807
Of course it is.
It isn't.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.075
Yes, it is.

04:07.143 --> 04:08.810
I'm not gonna
talk to you
anymore, gene.

04:08.878 --> 04:10.779
I'm in a wall.
Go look it up,
though.

04:10.847 --> 04:12.180
I just did.
It's salman rushdie.

04:12.248 --> 04:14.249
linda: They're here!

04:14.317 --> 04:15.984
Bob, come out
of the wall, please!

04:16.052 --> 04:16.985
Yeah.

04:17.053 --> 04:19.154
Hello!

04:19.221 --> 04:20.755
Al!
Oh, my god.

04:20.822 --> 04:23.158
Don't leave
our bags out there
on the street.

04:23.226 --> 04:24.626
Are you crazy?

04:26.295 --> 04:28.663
What are all these pots
doing on the floor?

04:28.731 --> 04:30.065
Bob'll pick 'em up, mom.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.800
Bob, quit foolin' around
in there.

04:31.868 --> 04:33.869
You're gonna
get yourself stuck.

04:33.936 --> 04:37.105
Eh, uh, uh-oh!

04:37.173 --> 04:38.707
Lin! Lin!

04:38.775 --> 04:39.908
Yes? What?

04:39.976 --> 04:41.710
You're never
gonna believe this.

04:41.778 --> 04:42.878
What is it? What?

04:42.945 --> 04:44.179
I'm stuck!

04:47.383 --> 04:48.617
Shouldn't have farted.

04:50.163 --> 04:51.663
Gloria: Who's trapped
in the wall?

04:51.731 --> 04:53.032
Bob.
Bob: Me.

04:53.099 --> 04:55.000
Bob can't fit
in the wall.

04:55.068 --> 04:56.168
He's overweight.

04:56.236 --> 04:57.336
Mom.
What?

04:57.404 --> 04:58.604
He can't hear me.

04:58.671 --> 05:01.073
Yes, I can.
I'm right here.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.042
I'd like to order
a hamburger.

05:03.109 --> 05:05.411
No, al! He can't
have a hamburger.

05:05.478 --> 05:07.346
He can have
a turkey burger.

05:07.414 --> 05:10.182
There's
no such thing as
a turkey burger.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.216
Go read
your "maxim."

05:11.284 --> 05:12.584
Dad gets "maxim"?

05:12.652 --> 05:15.454
No. He found it
in the recycling
at the condo.

05:15.522 --> 05:17.156
Who's on
the cover?

05:17.223 --> 05:18.557
The girls of
"coyote ugly."

05:18.625 --> 05:21.193
I don't think
they're even
alive anymore.

05:21.261 --> 05:22.728
Lin, we need to open
the restaurant.

05:22.796 --> 05:24.630
Hey, I bet I can
get down there.

05:24.697 --> 05:27.066
What are you
talking about?
You can go down?

05:27.133 --> 05:28.634
Kids,
you meet me
down there, ok?

05:28.701 --> 05:30.736
You're gonna
be my eyes
and my hands.

05:30.804 --> 05:32.171
Ok. We're
down there.

05:32.238 --> 05:34.139
No, you're not.
You haven't
moved!

05:34.207 --> 05:36.642
I'm turning on the grill!
Beep boop. Whoosh!

05:36.709 --> 05:39.211
That's not
the sound
the grill makes.

05:39.279 --> 05:40.479
Go down to
the restaurant.

05:40.547 --> 05:43.215
Ok, so the special
comes with feta cheese,

05:43.283 --> 05:45.350
And it's called
never been feta.

05:45.418 --> 05:48.153
Heh. Did you hear that?
Are you laughing?

05:48.221 --> 05:49.388
Ha. Ha ha!

05:49.456 --> 05:51.657
I hear you laughing.
Are you writing it?

05:51.724 --> 05:55.427
Yep.
Never been feta.

05:55.495 --> 05:58.097
Good. All right,
I'm gonna go get tina
set up on the grill.

05:58.164 --> 05:59.598
This is going great!

06:04.471 --> 06:06.238
Hey, kids!
Gene! Louise!

06:06.306 --> 06:07.306
Hey!
Hey.

06:07.373 --> 06:09.508
Take this.
That's my pee.

06:09.576 --> 06:10.609
Oh. Uhh.
Yeah.

06:10.677 --> 06:12.678
Empty it out and
bring it back, ok?

06:12.745 --> 06:13.812
This'll be
our system.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.280
Uh...
You're my pee guy.

06:15.348 --> 06:16.548
Dad's pee.

06:16.616 --> 06:19.251
Ohh. Bob, I called
teddy the contractor!

06:19.319 --> 06:21.820
He's coming right away
to get you out!

06:21.888 --> 06:23.889
What? No. Lin,
that's not necessary.

06:23.957 --> 06:25.290
Of course it is.

06:25.358 --> 06:26.658
You're stuck
in the wall.

06:26.726 --> 06:29.261
No, I know. Just you
know how teddy is.

06:29.329 --> 06:30.529
Talky teddy,
yap yap yap.

06:30.597 --> 06:33.332
What, you don't have
time for his stories?

06:33.399 --> 06:35.167
Are you very,
very busy today?

06:35.235 --> 06:36.568
Uh, no.

06:36.636 --> 06:38.904
You're in a tight spot,
huh, bobby?

06:38.972 --> 06:40.439
A little bit, teddy.

06:40.507 --> 06:41.907
Ehh. I've heard of buildings
like this, you know,

06:41.975 --> 06:43.142
With false walls.
Uh-huh.

06:43.209 --> 06:44.576
It's a prohibition thing.
Oh.

06:44.644 --> 06:46.345
Yeah, this town, it used
to be a bootleggers port.

06:46.412 --> 06:47.713
A lot of people
don't know that.

06:47.780 --> 06:49.548
That's interesting.

06:49.616 --> 06:51.783
Yeah. My great-uncle
used to run a speakeasy
here in town.

06:51.851 --> 06:53.652
It was called swanky's,
place called swanky's.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.321
You ever hear
of a cocktail called
the swanky-panky?

06:56.389 --> 06:58.323
No.
It's made with
2 parts vermouth...

06:58.391 --> 06:59.525
Teddy. Teddy.
Teddy, listen.

06:59.592 --> 07:01.426
Don't get me out
today, ok?

07:01.494 --> 07:03.629
Tell linda
you have to come
back tomorrow.

07:03.696 --> 07:05.230
I got the sawzall
in the truck. I don't even...

07:05.298 --> 07:06.598
No, no, no.
Teddy, listen.

07:06.666 --> 07:08.934
Tell her that you
need a permit
or something.

07:09.002 --> 07:11.103
You want to stay
in the wall, bob?

07:11.171 --> 07:12.804
Don't judge, teddy.
Don't judge.

07:12.872 --> 07:15.541
There's nothing wrong
with a man enjoying
his crawl space

07:15.608 --> 07:16.842
Till his in-laws leave.

07:16.910 --> 07:19.411
No. It's just, you know,
I heard about this guy

07:19.479 --> 07:21.480
That hid out in a wall
from the police.

07:21.548 --> 07:22.514
He went bonkers, bob.

07:22.582 --> 07:23.882
You know,
when they found him,

07:23.950 --> 07:25.584
He was chewin'
on a 2x4,

07:25.652 --> 07:27.152
Wearin' nothin'
but copper wire.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.654
That's a great
story, teddy.

07:28.721 --> 07:29.955
Just come back
tomorrow.

07:30.023 --> 07:32.758
Ok. I still gotta charge you
for today, though.

07:32.825 --> 07:34.826
Today? You just
stood there talking.

07:34.894 --> 07:36.428
Bob, you know,
my therapist says

07:36.496 --> 07:38.530
That if I don't
value my time,
nobody's goin' to.

07:38.598 --> 07:39.765
All right.
You're right.
Right. Just...

07:39.832 --> 07:41.433
All right. I'm just
gonna write it up

07:41.501 --> 07:42.601
As a consultation.
No friend prices.

07:42.669 --> 07:44.469
All right, do whatever
you have to do

07:44.537 --> 07:45.938
And just drop the bill
down the shaft.

07:46.005 --> 07:46.939
All right.

07:47.006 --> 07:47.940
Did you get it?

07:48.007 --> 07:48.941
Did you drop it?

07:49.008 --> 07:49.841
I dropped it.

07:49.909 --> 07:51.743
I didn't get it.

07:51.811 --> 07:53.345
Well, I can't have
the... you know,
the things outstanding.

07:53.413 --> 07:55.447
Teddy, I'll look
for it, all right?
Find it.

07:55.515 --> 07:56.682
Write another one,
then!

07:56.749 --> 07:59.084
I don't have... now I
gotta go to the truck.

07:59.919 --> 08:01.303
Ok, as you can see,

08:01.371 --> 08:02.754
I'm spending
my first night

08:02.822 --> 08:05.157
Inside the walls
of my own house.

08:05.225 --> 08:08.393
I borrowed gene's camera
so I can document
my experience.

08:08.461 --> 08:10.495
Linda: Come on, bob.
It's late.

08:10.563 --> 08:13.498
And louise has
loaned me her
kuchi kupi night light.

08:13.566 --> 08:14.633
Louise: Kuchi kopi.

08:14.701 --> 08:16.201
Kuchi kopi.
Kuchi kopi night light.

08:16.269 --> 08:18.237
Anyway, here's where
I'm gonna sleep tonight.

08:18.304 --> 08:19.972
I'll show you.

08:20.039 --> 08:22.641
Gloria: Oh, al. Yes.

08:24.310 --> 08:34.152
Oh, my god.

08:34.220 --> 08:37.155
Oh, my god. I thin
'cause I am not
taking care of that baby.

08:37.222 --> 08:38.523
I'm gonna sample it.

08:45.898 --> 08:46.965
Well, hello.

08:47.033 --> 08:49.434
Funny seeing you here.

08:49.502 --> 08:51.687
Whoa. Double trouble.

08:51.754 --> 08:53.438
Ok, let's do this.

08:56.409 --> 08:57.843
You sound like
my grandmother.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.244
what?
I can't hear you.

08:59.312 --> 09:02.848
And you sound like
my grandfather.

09:02.915 --> 09:04.967
Please stop touching
each other. Please stop
touching each other.

09:05.051 --> 09:06.418
Aah!

09:22.969 --> 09:24.536
Gene, you ready
to give your report?

09:24.604 --> 09:27.973
Oh. Uh...

09:29.609 --> 09:31.543
My grandparents
are staying with us,

09:31.611 --> 09:33.812
And they were both alive
during prohibition.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.847
So this is
what it sounds like

09:35.915 --> 09:38.850
When they have sex
in the room next to mine.

09:38.918 --> 09:40.786
Gloria:
Oww. Oww. Ahh.

09:40.853 --> 09:41.820
O-o-o-oww oww.

09:41.888 --> 09:42.921
Al: What?
Oww.

09:42.989 --> 09:44.856
Principal's office! Now!

09:44.924 --> 09:46.458
O-o-oww oww!
Right.

09:46.526 --> 09:48.827
Ahhhhh hah.

09:50.096 --> 09:53.965
Father, in life,
this restaurant
was your curse.

09:54.017 --> 09:57.836
Now, in death,
your restless spirit
haunts this place.

09:57.904 --> 10:00.005
Speak to us, father!

10:00.073 --> 10:01.440
Bob: Louise, is that you?

10:01.507 --> 10:02.507
Did you hear that?

10:02.575 --> 10:04.443
Yes. It's louise!
Your daughter!

10:04.510 --> 10:05.911
Go to the light,
father!

10:05.978 --> 10:08.714
Oh, ok, I see.
Very funny. I'm a ghost.

10:08.781 --> 10:11.750
Ask him anything
you wanna know about
the other side.

10:11.818 --> 10:13.685
Are you the ghost
from the movie "ghost"?

10:13.753 --> 10:16.672
No. Louise already
told you I'm the ghost
of her dead dad.

10:16.739 --> 10:18.006
Come on.
Next question.

10:18.074 --> 10:20.609
Are you the ghost
from the movie
"ghost dad"?

10:20.677 --> 10:21.910
What did I just say?

10:21.978 --> 10:23.412
This is what
you ask a ghost?

10:23.479 --> 10:24.813
You know what this
makes me wanna do?

10:24.881 --> 10:26.682
Eat your souls!

10:26.749 --> 10:27.799
Run!

10:27.867 --> 10:28.800
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

10:28.868 --> 10:30.669
Oh, god!
He got me!

10:30.737 --> 10:32.904
At least you're
holding me now.

10:32.972 --> 10:34.840
What is going on
over here?

10:34.907 --> 10:36.241
Bob: Uh, sorry, lin.

10:36.309 --> 10:37.876
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself.

10:37.944 --> 10:39.911
I'll go back
to running the kitchen,

10:39.979 --> 10:41.913
Busing tables,
and taking care
of the kids.

10:41.981 --> 10:43.648
Oh, boy.
Lin, don't be mad.

10:43.716 --> 10:44.750
Come here.
No.

10:44.817 --> 10:45.817
Come over
toward my hand.

10:45.885 --> 10:47.085
All right. All right.

10:47.153 --> 10:48.987
Let me
stroke your hair
the way you like.

10:49.055 --> 10:50.589
Isn't this nice?

10:52.191 --> 10:53.859
Oh, god.

10:53.926 --> 10:55.427
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

10:55.495 --> 10:58.430
Linda, that's your mom's
throat clear exactly.

10:58.498 --> 10:59.598
Yes. And?

10:59.665 --> 11:01.466
Well, first you
make sounds like her.

11:01.534 --> 11:04.102
Next thing, you'll be
yelling, "no burgers.
Read your 'maxim.'"

11:04.170 --> 11:07.406
I mean, you already
kind of nag like
she does. Whoop.

11:07.473 --> 11:08.540
Where's the hair?

11:08.608 --> 11:10.742
I am not turning
into my mother!

11:10.810 --> 11:12.511
That bathroom
is filthy.

11:12.578 --> 11:14.780
Who was the last
person in there?

11:14.847 --> 11:18.049
You go back
in there and you
wipe the seat.

11:18.117 --> 11:19.985
Bob: Hey, no nagging
my customers!

11:20.052 --> 11:21.820
Don't you yell
at my mother!

11:21.888 --> 11:23.688
What's that,
nagatha christie?

11:23.756 --> 11:27.592
Linda, sweetheart,
you've got more than
you can handle here.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.962
Your father and I
have decided to stay
another night.

11:31.030 --> 11:32.030
What?! No!

11:32.098 --> 11:34.433
We'll stay as long
as we need to.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.434
No, no, no! No!

11:35.501 --> 11:36.635
Knock, knock.

11:36.702 --> 11:37.702
Who's there?

11:37.770 --> 11:39.805
I got detention.
Aw, come on.

11:39.872 --> 11:42.307
Yeah. But I don't wanna
beat myself up about it,

11:42.375 --> 11:43.708
Since it's really
dad's fault.

11:43.776 --> 11:45.477
it's your
history report.
Yeah.

11:45.545 --> 11:46.745
Thanks, mom.
We're gonna...

11:46.813 --> 11:48.380
You know what?
We're gonna
need you.

11:48.448 --> 11:50.015
We'll take
all the help we can
get around here.

11:50.082 --> 11:52.484
No, no, no. No.
Linda, I'm gonna
get out of here.

11:52.552 --> 11:53.652
They don't
have to stay.

11:53.719 --> 11:54.920
I have...
I have an idea,

11:54.987 --> 11:56.488
A new idea I just
thought of

11:56.556 --> 11:58.089
On how I can
get out right away.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.093
Oh, boy.

12:02.161 --> 12:03.228
ow.

12:03.296 --> 12:05.230
ow! Son of a bitch!

12:05.298 --> 12:07.599
Where did he go?

12:07.667 --> 12:09.868
I can... I can hear him.

12:09.936 --> 12:10.802
Lin...
Yeah?

12:10.870 --> 12:11.870
I'm stuck.

12:11.938 --> 12:13.071
Yeah, I know, bob.

12:13.139 --> 12:14.606
No,
I'm really stuck.

12:14.674 --> 12:17.409
What are you
talking about?

12:17.477 --> 12:19.878
Are you telling me
you weren't stuck before?!

12:19.946 --> 12:21.046
No.

12:21.113 --> 12:22.881
You were fakin' it.

12:22.949 --> 12:24.483
I can't believe this.

12:24.550 --> 12:25.584
Bob's burgers.

12:25.651 --> 12:26.918
Teddy: Hi, linda.
It's teddy.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.119
Oh, hi, teddy.

12:28.187 --> 12:30.589
Hey, I'm on my way over
to get bob out.

12:30.656 --> 12:33.625
You know what?
We actually don't need you
to come and get bob out.

12:33.693 --> 12:34.526
Oh, really?

12:34.594 --> 12:35.627
Yeah, he's fine.

12:35.695 --> 12:36.628
What? No! We...

12:36.696 --> 12:37.729
Teddy! Te...
we need...

12:37.797 --> 12:39.030
I need
to come out!

12:39.098 --> 12:40.899
Bye, teddy.
Teddy!

12:40.967 --> 12:42.167
Have fun in there!

12:42.235 --> 12:44.936
Linda!

12:47.692 --> 12:49.760
Ok, day 3 stuck
in the wall.

12:49.828 --> 12:52.429
I sure would love
to go poo.

12:52.497 --> 12:54.064
That would be good.

12:54.950 --> 12:56.183
Oww!

12:56.251 --> 12:58.752
Yep. Ok. I can't
get out that way.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.654
Ohh. I got
a big splinter.

13:00.722 --> 13:02.423
Uhh. Feel
a little faint.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.658
Uhh. Keep it together, bob.

13:04.726 --> 13:06.393
Are there spiders
everywhere?

13:06.461 --> 13:09.296
Aah! On me! On me!
Aah! Spi...

13:09.364 --> 13:11.832
You understand me,
don't you, night light?

13:15.220 --> 13:17.154
Tell me. Why did you

13:17.222 --> 13:19.757
Want to have a séance
in your family's restaurant?

13:19.824 --> 13:22.293
And when exactly did
your father pass away?

13:22.360 --> 13:24.428
Uh, I forget.

13:24.496 --> 13:25.629
Give me your hands.

13:25.697 --> 13:26.830
Let's summon
his spirit now.

13:26.898 --> 13:28.932
If that'll help,p, sure.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.302
Ok. I need you to
hum with me, please.

13:31.369 --> 13:33.871
Hum with you?
Yeah.

13:35.307 --> 13:37.741
♪ ung ung ung
ung ung ung ♪

13:37.809 --> 13:39.343
Big door.

13:39.411 --> 13:40.744
Was this always here?

13:44.249 --> 13:47.217
Wow. There's a speakeasy
in the crawl space.

13:47.268 --> 13:49.320
What a great idea.

13:49.387 --> 13:50.971
Nice to see you,
mr. Bob.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.107
Nice to see you,
kuchi kopi.

13:53.174 --> 13:54.808
What'll it be,
mr. Bob?

13:54.876 --> 13:58.545
Give me some hooch,
your best bootleg hooch.

14:00.582 --> 14:02.850
heh.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.952
How are things
going, mr. Bob?

14:05.020 --> 14:06.587
Things could be better,
kuchi.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.722
Things could be
a whole lot better.

14:08.790 --> 14:11.959
Do you need to use
the facilities, mr. Bob?

14:12.027 --> 14:13.293
Go number 2?

14:13.361 --> 14:14.995
I'm glad you asked, kuchi.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.499
Yes, I do need
to go number 2.

14:18.566 --> 14:22.503
Yes, I do, a lot.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.521
Here's my creation.

14:24.589 --> 14:26.190
I call it
the tunami.

14:26.257 --> 14:28.525
You're gonna sell
a million of these.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.527
You know,
that tastes so good,

14:30.595 --> 14:33.797
I say we make it
the burger of the day.

14:33.865 --> 14:37.568
So your
mother-in-law
is quite willful.

14:37.635 --> 14:38.802
Yeah, she is.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.572
She needs
to be corrected.

14:41.639 --> 14:42.940
What does that mean?
Killed.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.577
Wow. You turned into a mean
little night light, kuchi.

14:46.644 --> 14:49.546
Did you know
your wife and
your mother-in-law

14:49.614 --> 14:53.317
Are trying to
interfere with
your business?

14:53.385 --> 14:54.585
They are?
My business?

14:54.652 --> 14:56.687
Yes. They are
attempting to bring

14:56.755 --> 15:00.290
An outside protein
into the situation.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.825
An outside protein?

15:01.893 --> 15:03.627
Tuna.
Tuna?!

15:03.695 --> 15:06.296
I'm so tired.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.465
My grandparents are
haunting my dreams.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.300
I need a nap.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.736
I could crawl up in
the ceiling and sleep.

15:12.804 --> 15:13.971
That's what dad
would do.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.640
Yeah. I'm gonna
make him proud of me.

15:17.409 --> 15:18.809
Oh, it's nice up here.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.310
Boy: Man, you're ripped.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.745
Your abs look like
challah bread.

15:21.813 --> 15:23.547
Second boy: Thanks.
You look...

15:23.615 --> 15:27.384
Oh, my god. The boys'
locker room must be
right over there.

15:27.452 --> 15:28.452
I'll sleep later.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.803
Bob, raspy:
Poison.

15:29.871 --> 15:30.821
What?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.589
Mercury poisoning

15:32.657 --> 15:34.425
In the tuna fish!

15:35.927 --> 15:36.860
Bob, stop.

15:36.928 --> 15:37.861
"bob, stop."

15:37.929 --> 15:38.929
good one, kuchi.

15:38.997 --> 15:40.731
Who are you
talking to?

15:40.799 --> 15:42.699
Oh, no one,
just a friend.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.501
He's losing it
in there.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.336
Ok, it's time for you
to come out.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.372
There is
no out, linda,

15:48.440 --> 15:49.740
Not anymore.
Where am I?

15:49.808 --> 15:51.675
Am I here,
or am I here?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.343
Bob...
I'm everywhere!

15:53.411 --> 15:55.712
I'm calling
the fire department.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.481
drop the towel.

15:57.549 --> 15:59.483
There it is again.
Did you hear it?

15:59.551 --> 16:00.484
Drop the...

16:00.552 --> 16:01.919
Aah!

16:01.986 --> 16:04.721
3 siblings in trouble
in 2 days,

16:04.789 --> 16:06.557
That's a red flag
right there.

16:06.624 --> 16:08.425
What's going on
with you guys?

16:08.493 --> 16:10.127
Our father
got trapped
in the wall.

16:10.195 --> 16:11.895
Is that how he died?

16:11.963 --> 16:12.963
Dad's dead?

16:13.031 --> 16:14.331
Good job, mr. Frond.

16:14.399 --> 16:16.500
We were gonna tell her
on father's day.

16:16.568 --> 16:19.369
Now we have nothing
to do on father's day!

16:19.437 --> 16:21.371
Ok, you know what you are?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.006
You are kids in crisis.

16:23.074 --> 16:25.976
We need to conduct
a home visit today.

16:26.044 --> 16:27.377
Yeah!
Ok. Ok.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.846
Let's get
over there.

16:28.913 --> 16:30.614
Oh, my gosh.
What are those?

16:30.682 --> 16:31.682
Grief puppets.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.484
Bring 'em.
We're gonna need 'em.

16:33.551 --> 16:35.118
What about those?
Are you gonna
bring those?

16:35.186 --> 16:36.153
Crisis crayons?
You think?

16:36.221 --> 16:37.688
Crisis crayons,
absolutely.

16:37.755 --> 16:40.390
I've got so many
drawings that
I need to do.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.426
Linda: Hey, I-I'm sorry.

16:42.494 --> 16:44.094
It's a little loud
in here.

16:44.162 --> 16:46.530
Y-you're coming
for a home visit when?

16:46.581 --> 16:48.298
Right there. Chop.

16:48.366 --> 16:50.634
Don't do it.
I'm staying
in here.

16:50.702 --> 16:52.035
He's loopy. Chop.

16:52.103 --> 16:54.004
I'm never
coming out!

16:54.072 --> 16:55.672
Yeah, we see this
all the time.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.908
I'll chop a hole,
but it's probably
not gonna do it.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.776
You'll have to put
some food out.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.411
What's going on?

17:01.479 --> 17:02.846
They probably
got complaints
about the smell

17:02.914 --> 17:04.647
And came to get the body
out of the wall.

17:04.715 --> 17:06.517
You mean it's
still in there?

17:06.584 --> 17:07.684
Well, parts of him.

17:07.752 --> 17:09.019
Oh, my god.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.654
It's a real crisis,
mr. Frond!

17:10.722 --> 17:12.321
Yeah.
It's a crisis!

17:12.390 --> 17:14.525
Yeah!
Crisis!
We're all in crisis!

17:14.592 --> 17:18.428
All right! Ok!
Don't you take my daddy
out of the wall!

17:19.430 --> 17:21.164
Bob, I'm sitting here

17:21.232 --> 17:22.398
With the counselor
from school,

17:22.467 --> 17:23.967
Who thinks you're dead,

17:24.035 --> 17:26.837
So this would be
a great time to grow up
and help out.

17:26.905 --> 17:28.872
Bob: A counselor?
What is this, camp?

17:28.940 --> 17:31.575
Heh heh heh.
I'm funny in the wall.

17:31.643 --> 17:33.744
I... ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

17:33.795 --> 17:35.612
Your husband
is not dead?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.514
No, just aggravating.

17:37.582 --> 17:41.051
Ok, why would
louise let me think
that he was dead?

17:41.119 --> 17:44.454
Oh, she just likes
messing with people
she thinks are stup...

17:44.522 --> 17:45.589
I know!
What? I...

17:45.657 --> 17:47.691
How about a burger?

17:47.759 --> 17:49.893
Want something from
the restaurant, a burger?

17:49.961 --> 17:51.194
No. I don't eat meat.

17:51.262 --> 17:52.496
Ah.
Bob, soft: Kill him.

17:52.564 --> 17:53.764
shut up, kuchi.

17:53.831 --> 17:58.669
I've got some nice
ground beef for you, bob.

18:00.738 --> 18:01.905
Bob!

18:01.973 --> 18:04.074
I'm starting to get
a better picture here.

18:04.142 --> 18:06.910
Right now I'm
looking up guidelines
for when and how

18:06.978 --> 18:09.713
Social services
should get involved
in a case like this.

18:09.781 --> 18:10.914
What?!
Yeah.

18:10.982 --> 18:12.950
Social services?
Yeah.

18:13.017 --> 18:14.585
What?!
Yeah!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.723
That throat-clearing
sound,

18:19.791 --> 18:22.025
It's coming from
inside the wall!

18:22.093 --> 18:23.493
Bob!

18:23.561 --> 18:25.095
Oh, my god!

18:27.613 --> 18:30.115
Bob, come towards
my voice.

18:30.183 --> 18:31.349
I'll yell.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.818
Aah!

18:32.885 --> 18:34.786
Aah!

18:34.854 --> 18:36.488
My mother's
visiting us.

18:36.556 --> 18:38.123
Gloria:
Stop crawling away!

18:38.191 --> 18:39.858
Bob: This isn't happening!

18:39.926 --> 18:41.493
Get ahold
of yourself!

18:41.561 --> 18:42.661
Don't shake me.

18:42.729 --> 18:45.597
I might go
to the bathroom.

18:45.665 --> 18:47.699
Here's bobby.

18:47.767 --> 18:49.601
I found him.

18:49.669 --> 18:50.519
Aah!
Ohh!

18:50.603 --> 18:51.603
That's hot!

18:56.209 --> 18:57.743
Ahh.
Oww.

19:00.613 --> 19:01.913
Oh. Wow.

19:01.981 --> 19:03.181
Much better.

19:03.249 --> 19:05.550
Bad modeling,
poor boundaries...

19:05.618 --> 19:07.219
Well, really,
no boundaries.

19:07.286 --> 19:09.554
I'm gonna have to make
some calls.

19:09.622 --> 19:11.923
Wait, mr. Frond,
now that I have
a clear head,

19:11.991 --> 19:13.658
I want to apologize
to everybody.

19:13.726 --> 19:16.328
Hiding in the walls
was selfish
and dumb.

19:16.395 --> 19:18.830
And, linda, I'm
sorry I called you
nagatha christie.

19:18.898 --> 19:21.233
It was in the heat
of the moment,

19:21.300 --> 19:22.567
And it was
really dumb.

19:22.635 --> 19:23.835
Aww. Thank you, bobby.

19:23.903 --> 19:25.837
I mean,
I can do better,

19:25.905 --> 19:28.373
Like spiro nagnew.
Heh.

19:28.441 --> 19:30.442
All right, quit
while you're ahead.

19:30.510 --> 19:31.443
Naggedy ann?

19:31.511 --> 19:32.811
Secretary of
nagriculture?

19:32.879 --> 19:34.546
Ha!
Now,
that one's funny.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.615
That one's funny.
I like... ha ha ha!

19:36.682 --> 19:38.517
I'm not a...
I'm not a nag.

19:38.584 --> 19:39.918
That's funny,
though. I like it.

19:39.986 --> 19:40.919
Social services?

19:40.987 --> 19:42.654
Now, hold on
there, pal.

19:42.722 --> 19:43.655
Hey... eh!

19:43.723 --> 19:44.656
Are you married?

19:44.724 --> 19:45.657
You have kids?

19:45.725 --> 19:47.325
No a-and no.

19:47.393 --> 19:48.660
Listen to me.

19:48.711 --> 19:51.596
My daughter is
the best mother
in the world,

19:51.664 --> 19:55.433
And this one,
he is nuts,
but guess what.

19:55.501 --> 19:58.170
Having a family
makes you go nuts.

19:58.237 --> 19:59.771
So if you
don't have kids,

19:59.839 --> 20:01.606
I don't think
you know enough

20:01.674 --> 20:03.108
To be calling in
anyone.

20:03.176 --> 20:05.644
In fact, I don't
think you come out

20:05.711 --> 20:07.312
Looking so good here
yourself.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.715
I wonder if you
even got permission
from the school

20:10.783 --> 20:12.384
To come
over here today.

20:12.451 --> 20:13.718
He didn't.

20:13.786 --> 20:15.220
He took us away
from learning!

20:15.288 --> 20:17.189
We were in the car
with mr. Frond,

20:17.256 --> 20:19.291
And he didn't make
us wear seat belts.

20:19.358 --> 20:20.292
What?!

20:21.861 --> 20:24.830
How about you put
your phone and your
little notebook

20:24.897 --> 20:28.500
Back in your pocket
there and leave
this family alone!

20:28.568 --> 20:30.635
Heh. Ok. All right.

20:30.703 --> 20:32.737
All right. All right.

20:32.788 --> 20:33.772
All right.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.675
Gloria, thank you.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.477
Come back soon,
you two.

20:39.545 --> 20:41.313
Bye, gram.
Bye, gramps.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.849
See you
in my dreams.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.851
Well, I have
a room to refart.

20:45.918 --> 20:48.737
Dad, can I have
my night light back now?
No.

20:48.804 --> 20:50.305
Give it to me.
Stop it.

20:50.389 --> 20:51.623
Give it to me.
Stop it.

20:51.691 --> 20:52.657
Give it.
Stop it.

20:52.725 --> 20:53.959
It's my night light.
No. Stop.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.193
This is
embarrassing to me.

20:55.261 --> 20:56.728
No!
You're a grown man!

20:56.796 --> 20:57.796
I'm keeping it!
