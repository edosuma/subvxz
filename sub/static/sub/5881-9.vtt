WEBVTT

00:56.682 --> 00:59.016
Mommy, look at that!

01:36.472 --> 01:37.722
Hello.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.808
Don Draper. How are you?

01:40.893 --> 01:45.104
Probably about like you :
enduring the splendor of Fiorello!

01:45.189 --> 01:48.816
You know we got
that Israeli tourism thing , right?

01:48.901 --> 01:50.443
Mazel tov.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.613
I ran into Jim Jordan from BBDO
at the Athletic Club

01:53.697 --> 01:57.283
with, uh , Frank from Y&R.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.410
Your name came up.

01:59.495 --> 02:01.746
Three millionaires
in towels in a steam room .

02:01.830 --> 02:03.539
I don't know how to take that.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.166
Take it as a compliment,

02:05.250 --> 02:08.503
a sign that you're
destined for greater things.

02:08.587 --> 02:11.964
I think "Jesus Over Rio"
was the best tourist campaign

02:12.049 --> 02:13.466
I've seen in over 20 years.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.593
Wasn't good enough
to land the Israelis.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.969
Ah , that's not you .

02:17.054 --> 02:19.639
That's the tiny store you work in .

02:19.723 --> 02:22.683
Now, if you were with me at McCann ,

02:22.768 --> 02:25.019
you'd have over 500 people
at your disposal--

02:25.103 --> 02:27.021
and that's just in New York.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.940
We can get a lot of things done.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.692
Can you get me out
of the second half of this show?

02:31.777 --> 02:35.196
All I'm saying is you've done your time
in the farm leagues.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.657
Yankee Stadium is on the line.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.742
I changed my mind .

02:39.827 --> 02:42.119
I decided you deserve a visit to the bar.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.413
Adele, this is Donald Draper.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.708
If we're being introduced ,
I assume that you're in advertising .

02:47.793 --> 02:50.002
Would you both like
to talk about that some more?

02:50.087 --> 02:51.045
Betty.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.171
My wife.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.339
Jim and Adele Hobart.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.591
Hello. Betty Draper.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.717
A pleasure.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.761
Your husband here was about to prove

02:58.846 --> 03:01.848
that he can speak about things
other than advertising .

03:01.932 --> 03:03.641
Oh , he's very interesting .

03:03.725 --> 03:05.893
Well, then, come with me.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.353
Let's get those drinks.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.563
We'll be back.

03:08.647 --> 03:09.772
Champagne?

03:19.241 --> 03:24.078
Besides getting the handsome prince,
are you an actress or something?

03:24.162 --> 03:27.290
No, I'm a housewife.

03:27.374 --> 03:32.295
I did do some modeling . , .
a lifetime ago.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.130
I'm not surprised .

03:34.214 --> 03:36.632
That is some face you've got there.

03:36.717 --> 03:40.094
Anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.888
They used to.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.932
You know what?

03:45.017 --> 03:47.351
Coca-Cola's deep into this, uh ,

03:47.436 --> 03:50.104
international campaign right now.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.441
A European face like yours,
like Grace Kelly's,

03:53.525 --> 03:55.985
might be a road we could go down .

03:56.069 --> 03:59.113
U h , we could put a call out
for a Grace Kelly type,

03:59.197 --> 04:02.909
but, uh, I don't think we'd come this close.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.869
You say you've modeled?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.579
I'm retired .

04:09.207 --> 04:10.291
This is silly.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.542
Think about it.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.670
Your coloring with a green bottle
and an Irish setter--

04:16.632 --> 04:18.299
Oh, drink up.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.593
It's back to Tammany Hall.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.136
I like the show.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.638
Very gay songs.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.600
Well, we'd better get back in there or leave.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.685
Come on .

04:29.770 --> 04:32.521
Uh, it was very nice
meeting both of you .

04:52.918 --> 04:56.087
Why didn't you want
to go to dinner with Jim and Adele?

04:57.506 --> 04:59.799
People like Jim Hobart
always talk business

04:59.883 --> 05:03.010
because they have
nothing else to say.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.389
I can see that.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.182
You know, he gave me his card .

05:08.266 --> 05:09.475
Really?

05:09.559 --> 05:12.144
Did he tell you to put it
under my pillow of something?

05:12.229 --> 05:17.191
No. Actually, he was talking to me
about modeling .

05:17.275 --> 05:18.693
Was he?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.114
I don't think it was like that.

05:23.198 --> 05:27.493
He said something about Grace Kelly
and Coca-Cola.

05:28.495 --> 05:33.082
Well, then, there's no need
to doubt his interest, then .

05:33.166 --> 05:36.127
I did model , Don .

05:36.211 --> 05:38.963
Am I that wrong for Coca-Cola?

05:42.926 --> 05:44.927
You're not wrong for anything .

05:46.596 --> 05:49.306
So are you going to go there?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
How was Fiorello, exclamation point?

06:03.488 --> 06:08.325
It'll be six months before I can get Don
back into a Broadway theater.

06:10.746 --> 06:14.165
Oh , we ran into this agency head .

06:14.249 --> 06:16.250
Apparently he's courting Don .

06:16.334 --> 06:18.002
He gave me his card .

06:18.086 --> 06:20.212
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling .

06:20.297 --> 06:23.007
That's a heck of a line,
What did Don say?

06:23.091 --> 06:25.426
He basically said the man was trying
to sleep with one of us

06:25.510 --> 06:27.845
and that he didn't like the idea of either.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.933
I did do some modeling , you know.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.269
I did not know, but I'm not surprised .

06:35.353 --> 06:37.646
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.858
I was a model when I met Don .

06:40.942 --> 06:42.568
A model in Manhattan?

06:42.652 --> 06:43.819
Yes.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.030
It was exciting .

06:46.114 --> 06:48.657
But when I got started . . .

06:48.742 --> 06:51.202
the summer after college, in Italy.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.286
Italy?

06:52.370 --> 06:57.291
There was this Italian designer: Giovanni.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.335
He wanted to be called Johnny.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.420
That's how much he loved Americans.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.756
Well , he loved American girls.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.593
It was more of an artist/muse relationship.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.678
Okay.

07:18.063 --> 07:22.316
So. , .he made you all this,
and it was platonic?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.401
No petting , nothing?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.864
Mamma mia.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.700
And put my hair up like this.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.000
And Salvatore said he has
the Menken's artwork,

07:40.085 --> 07:41.335
and to meet him in the art department

07:41.419 --> 07:43.337
because you're going
to need a red pencil .

07:43.421 --> 07:44.880
Any other good news?

07:44.965 --> 07:48.551
I think the mail boy
dropped that off for you last night.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.327
Peggy, can you get me
an outside line?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.079
Right away.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.664
Don Draper.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.375
Now, why would you
call me out of the blue?

08:21.459 --> 08:23.586
I appreciate the gesture.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.214
It's not a gesture, Don,
it's an overture.

08:27.299 --> 08:30.384
Let me tell you, you're
a hard man to run into.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.760
I don't know what to say.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.179
Don't say anything.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.389
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.557
The Algonquin?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.392
There's a small hotel.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.436
Isn't that the song?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.023
I don't know. I'm--

08:44.107 --> 08:46.525
I'm not ready to wave the flag just yet.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.736
What about the details?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.406
I'd rather do this face-to-face.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.201
But you already know
what you're going to say.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.415
I don't have to tell you

09:01.499 --> 09:04.376
the obvious limitations of Sterling Cooper.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.878
But you're going to.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.463
Do I need to be careful here?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.631
It's a mom-and-pop.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.926
McCann Erickson
is an international company.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.887
We have a network that extends
far beyond Madison Avenue:

09:14.971 --> 09:17.723
Europe, South America.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.643
We're publicly traded.
We issue dividends.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.019
Small is bad.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.062
Don,

09:23.146 --> 09:25.648
do you know the kind
of clients we attract?

09:25.732 --> 09:27.274
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,

09:27.359 --> 09:28.442
Esso.

09:28.526 --> 09:29.735
Can you imagine the lifestyle

09:29.819 --> 09:31.612
that goes with handling Pan Am?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.447
It's a panty-dropper.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.782
Television?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.575
You could be in that in a bigger way.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.701
You know that.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.203
What, you want to sell corn?

09:39.287 --> 09:40.454
We do a show about Indians.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.457
Imagine yourself
in a three-year contract.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.460
35 per annum , security set in stone.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.545
Sterling probably hasn't
let you break 30 yet.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.464
No comment.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.967
I really don't like
doing this over the phone.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.762
All I can say is
eventually you come up here,

09:56.846 --> 09:58.806
or you die wondering .

10:06.064 --> 10:08.732
He gave me his card right in front of Don .

10:08.817 --> 10:12.486
Well, not right in front of him , I guess.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.322
Well , I told Don about it.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.661
I was a model , you know?

10:20.745 --> 10:24.456
In fact, I met Don on a photo shoot.

10:24.541 --> 10:28.836
I was wearing this Russian blue fox coat.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.257
He was just a copywriter at the fur company.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.635
I remember

10:36.720 --> 10:39.888
he saw that I didn't like
giving the coat back.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.057
It's always the hardest part.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.687
He asked me out.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.524
He wasn't shy. I liked that.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.776
I said no.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.486
Then three weeks later,

10:54.571 --> 10:56.488
the coat arrived at my apartment.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.533
Who knows what kind
of Indian trading

10:59.617 --> 11:02.411
he had to do to get it?

11:02.495 --> 11:07.541
I think I only had
two more jobs, maybe three,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.793
before we got engaged .

11:11.713 --> 11:13.630
And then I got pregnant.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.802
It's always a nightmare
raising children in Manhattan ,

11:18.887 --> 11:21.221
so we moved to Ossining.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.560
Suddenly I . . .

11:26.644 --> 11:29.563
really felt so old .

11:29.647 --> 11:32.024
Tell me more about that.

11:32.108 --> 11:36.653
My mother was very concerned
about looks and weight.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.116
And I've always eaten a lot.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.578
And I like hot dogs.

11:47.082 --> 11:51.919
Mother used to say,
"You're going to get stout."

11:54.631 --> 11:59.593
And then I became a model,
and she hated it,

11:59.677 --> 12:03.430
even though Suzy Parker
made $ 1 00,000 that year.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.434
My mother hated it.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.561
Manhattan .

12:12.941 --> 12:16.276
She called me a prostitute.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.445
You're angry at your mother.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.615
What?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.325
Are you going to talk now?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.452
You are angry at your mother.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.372
Of all the things I've said in here.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.791
You're sitting up.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.586
You don't listen to me.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.296
You don't listen to what I say,

12:36.381 --> 12:38.382
and then out of nowhere you provoke me.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.718
Tell me more about that.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.979
I miss her.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.400
I understand that.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.780
It's good and bad .

13:10.707 --> 13:14.168
She wanted me to be beautiful
so I could find a man.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.921
There's nothing wrong with that.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.553
But then what?

13:24.637 --> 13:29.266
Just sit and . . .smoke and . . .

13:29.350 --> 13:31.977
let it go till you're in a box?

13:36.774 --> 13:39.151
I don't care why he gave me his card .

14:09.140 --> 14:10.724
Where'd you get this?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.893
Kurt Teasdale over at Gil Bascom .

14:12.977 --> 14:14.102
It's already on the air.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.729
They wanted to do it
before she had the baby.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.315
Am I alone? I don't understand it.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.526
Because it's in Spanish .

14:20.610 --> 14:22.945
I recognize that finishing school voice.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.197
You can't govern and listen to that all day.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.282
I'm happy to give up
any Spanish speakers

14:27.367 --> 14:28.742
and hope this goes away.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.328
Cooper thinks if Kennedy creeps up
any more in the polls,

14:31.412 --> 14:32.621
Nixon will panic,

14:32.705 --> 14:33.872
and they'll get desperate for our efforts.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.290
He wants everything in place.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.875
More risk.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.753
Why are we doing this again?
And out of pocket?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.256
I for one don't question
the wishes of our clients.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.757
Clients come and go, Campbell .

14:43.841 --> 14:46.843
Sometimes it's best to rid them
of unrealistic expectations.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.179
Are you trying to say that we can't win?

14:49.264 --> 14:51.181
N ixon's got an 8-point lead in the polls.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.391
Not much .

14:52.475 --> 14:54.142
And we still haven't figured out a way

14:54.227 --> 14:56.186
to make an impact about
the N ixon campaign's involvement.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.772
My marching orders
were undecided states.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.774
I think a plan of attack
would make Coop happy.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.235
The 50/50s: Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.737
Now, it's easy to just say that, isn't it?

15:05.822 --> 15:07.948
I think women will hate her.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.534
It's like their better-looking sister
marries a handsome senator,

15:10.618 --> 15:12.703
and she's going to live in the White House.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.204
I'm practically jealous.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.591
H i.

15:25.675 --> 15:26.800
I called .

15:26.884 --> 15:29.595
I assumed you were staying in the city.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.013
The girl .

15:31.097 --> 15:34.808
We gave her a little extra work,
and now she's distracted .

15:34.892 --> 15:37.019
Look at that.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.731
It's raw, Don .

15:44.902 --> 15:46.903
Don , I realized something today.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.451
I miss modeling .

15:52.535 --> 15:54.661
You were always
telling me you hated it.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.496
Maybe the passing of time

15:56.581 --> 15:58.915
has made me. . .feel differently.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.835
Maybe it's Jim Hobart.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.587
So what?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.131
It's still an opportunity.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.841
You want to go back to work?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.218
A few days. I mean , is that so bad?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.845
I get paid .

16:11.929 --> 16:14.514
I can get Ethel to watch the kids.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.850
She watches them half the time now.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.811
That's three-, four-hour stretches.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.857
I think it would be fun
to go in and be that girl again .

16:23.941 --> 16:26.234
You're serious?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.863
There will still be ham .

16:29.947 --> 16:31.698
I promise.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.868
Are you resolved?

16:34.952 --> 16:37.746
Or is this even worth arguing?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.999
No, it's not like that.

16:41.084 --> 16:45.253
It's just. . .something I'd like to do.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.594
Well, I can't stop you
from doing what you want to do.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.071
You have no idea
how boring it is around here.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.075
Really? I would think one hour
on the Sterling Cooper switchboard

17:15.159 --> 17:16.326
would be a Russian novel .

17:16.411 --> 17:17.911
They told me it would happen,

17:17.995 --> 17:20.539
but the truth is
you really just stop listening .

17:20.623 --> 17:22.040
And put ice on your wrists.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.134
Peggy, do you need to go home?

17:32.218 --> 17:33.427
What?

17:33.511 --> 17:34.636
The sweater.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.596
Are you having one of those days?

17:36.681 --> 17:37.681
It's not that.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.890
I'd like to go home,

17:38.975 --> 17:40.308
but I just don't think I can .

17:40.393 --> 17:41.935
Then what is it?

17:42.019 --> 17:43.687
You're not helping your silhouette.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.858
I ripped my skirt.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.985
You don't have a needle and thread?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.737
It's a big rip.

17:51.821 --> 17:55.741
Oh, honey, I've got
a spare outfit squirreled away.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.033
You can borrow it.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.714
We're not exactly dressed
for that, are we?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.966
I've lost men like you before.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.303
It usually had to do with
my unexpressed confidence.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.513
I think you're one in a million, Draper.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.350
Those are nice clubs.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.395
That bonus from Cooper
must have made you happy.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.190
It was designed as a kind of an armor
against men like Jim Hobart.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.861
How'd you hear about it?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.117
I saw those clubs
going down the hallway.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.244
I thought they were for me.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.413
They're from Jim Hobart.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.083
What did he offer?

18:48.878 --> 18:51.505
Bigger.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.049
The world , basically.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.009
Well, it can't just be
a number on a salary,

18:56.093 --> 18:58.011
because you know we're open to that.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.846
Pan Am .

18:59.931 --> 19:05.560
Pan Am . . .is not McCann Erickson .

19:06.562 --> 19:08.271
Big talent attracts big clients.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.732
We can try and make
that happen here.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.317
- That's true.
- But don't be fooled .

19:12.401 --> 19:14.194
You hear Pan Am ,
you imagine London,

19:14.278 --> 19:16.112
holed up at the Dorchester
with three stewardesses.

19:16.197 --> 19:19.741
The truth is it's more like
a 20-hour boomerang flight

19:19.826 --> 19:21.952
so you can make
a coupon sing in Spanish.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.455
And when you have stockholders
like McCann does,

19:25.540 --> 19:28.500
you can't fire clients,
I know you'll hate that.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.965
I thought about leaving once.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.177
But you know?

19:39.262 --> 19:40.804
It's daunting .

19:40.888 --> 19:43.932
Why entertain the prospect of failure?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.308
That's a sad thought.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.562
No. It made me look at this place.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.355
I don't want to sound sentimental ,

19:50.439 --> 19:52.732
but it's not just accounts.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.944
Look around here at what you have.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.322
You want to start over?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.619
I haven't made up my mind .

20:10.251 --> 20:12.544
I'm taking this very personally.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.171
Why? It's business.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.091
Is it?

20:23.097 --> 20:25.098
McCann Erickson is the major leagues.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.474
Good . Let him go.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.560
You're right. Maybe he'll take me with him .

20:28.644 --> 20:30.395
Can you imagine the money?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.731
I heard he's making 30 already.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.191
He's not ten times better than me.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.111
You love him .

20:38.195 --> 20:39.821
Everybody loves him .

20:39.906 --> 20:41.656
Sure. His moods and the way he talks.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.117
I don't even know what he's
saying half the time.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.702
Clients do.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.213
I'll admit she crossed my mind once.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.009
She's having a very bad
freshman year.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.385
They went nuts for her writing .

21:02.470 --> 21:04.012
Belle Jolie, she did that.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.513
Belle Jolie was okay.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.642
She obviously let it go to her head--
and other parts of her.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.602
No, I don't think it's the job.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.562
I think we're seeing the real her:

21:12.647 --> 21:15.190
one of those girls
who slimmed down before she got here.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.151
Now she's here, and there she is.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.694
Who thinks about her?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.613
Maybe she'll go with Draper, too.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.323
It's a tragedy.

21:23.407 --> 21:28.161
Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.121
And no one ever got to eat it.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.375
Well , I got some work to do.

21:33.501 --> 21:38.505
Suddenly upon news of others' success,
a young man is filled with ambition .

21:38.589 --> 21:40.173
Drop dead .

21:40.257 --> 21:43.051
Harry, you busy?

21:58.275 --> 22:01.152
Well, hello. I can't believe this.

22:02.697 --> 22:06.950
I'm sorry. I , uh , overdid it.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.078
You're out of the business
a few years, and things change.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.206
Please, I'm overwhelmed
with the style of you .

22:13.290 --> 22:15.208
Betty Draper, meet Ronnie Gittridge.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.210
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.962
He's also my brother-in-law.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.255
It is a pleasure.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.215
Look at her. What did I say?

22:22.299 --> 22:23.800
You ready to work?

22:24.885 --> 22:25.885
I'm excited .

22:25.970 --> 22:27.345
It's not that complicated .

22:27.430 --> 22:29.806
He's either going to tell you
to think about something else

22:29.890 --> 22:31.224
or just stand there.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.602
Jim thinks everyone else's job is easy.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.979
Shall we?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.313
Mrs. Draper,

22:37.398 --> 22:39.357
it's just a tryout.

22:39.442 --> 22:40.817
No guarantees.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.361
I told you I've done this before.

22:43.446 --> 22:47.282
Now, where did you get that dress?

22:48.284 --> 22:49.242
So basically,

22:49.326 --> 22:51.119
whereas Secor previously
spent their money

22:51.203 --> 22:52.495
on local print and radio,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.831
we increase the network buy to 30% .

22:54.915 --> 22:56.249
More points for each dollar.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.252
Secor laxatives.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.379
You know, I have to talk
to those people.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.006
They're not what you would expect.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.259
They have absolutely
no sense of humor about their product.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.429
Who knew that college
was going to get me out of the army

23:09.513 --> 23:11.264
and into laxatives?

23:11.348 --> 23:13.391
College was the moment, wasn't it?

23:13.476 --> 23:16.936
Fun and games. . .and girls.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.521
Were you in a frat?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.857
Alpha Delta Phi.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.277
Also known as cutups.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.821
We were the cutups.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.617
We had this stray Dalmatian.

23:30.701 --> 23:32.577
Our mascot Mamie.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.079
So it died ,

23:34.163 --> 23:37.123
and in classic fraternity manner,
we decided to throw a party.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.792
Mamie's funeral .

23:38.876 --> 23:42.087
One of the pledges pipes in
that our rivals, Psi U--

23:42.171 --> 23:44.297
They are so gung-ho.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.008
Psi U is throwing a beauty pageant parade
on Main Street

23:47.093 --> 23:48.718
with the girls' school down the road .

23:48.803 --> 23:51.137
Now, my friend Chip--
he's a lawyer now--

23:51.222 --> 23:54.099
says "Why don't we go down there
and get a permit,

23:54.183 --> 23:57.811
throw a grand funeral for Mamie,
and let the girls run away crying?"

23:58.854 --> 24:02.065
That's great. Did you do it?

24:02.149 --> 24:05.151
We had police barricades
and 30 brothers following that pledge,

24:05.236 --> 24:07.654
who had the honor of pulling
Mamie in a Radio Flyer.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.656
That's beautiful .

24:09.740 --> 24:12.158
Idiots.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.410
Wait a minute.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.875
Nixon and Kennedy
are both buying up air time

24:20.960 --> 24:24.295
in these undecided states.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.672
It's an arms race.

24:25.756 --> 24:28.341
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.218
So if we can't increase
N ixon's presence,

24:30.302 --> 24:31.427
we can decrease Kennedy's.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.054
How do we do that?

24:33.139 --> 24:36.599
We make big buys in New Jersey,
Illinois, and wherever

24:36.684 --> 24:38.643
for Secor laxatives.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.354
Well, hold on .

24:41.438 --> 24:44.190
So Nixon's selling laxatives?

24:44.275 --> 24:46.693
No. We're selling laxatives.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.361
Nixon's selling Nixon .

24:48.445 --> 24:51.447
And Kennedy's
watching Mamie's funeral .

24:54.118 --> 24:55.410
This is scary.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.371
It is.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.415
Isn't it?

25:01.584 --> 25:02.876
Even careful mothers can't completely

25:02.960 --> 25:05.211
protect their families
from household germs

25:05.296 --> 25:06.421
just by cleaning alone.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.381
That's why you need Lysol.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.300
Lysol, added to your
regular cleaning water,

25:10.384 --> 25:12.010
eliminates germs that cause odors

25:12.094 --> 25:13.678
that may cause illness.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.597
Lysol: fastest, easiest,

25:15.681 --> 25:17.390
most effective way
to kill household germs--

25:17.474 --> 25:18.474
It was for me.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.977
. . .and lingering odors.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.062
Who was it?

25:23.147 --> 25:26.774
I'm the girl. The girl with the cola.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.279
It's only a couple days' work.

25:31.405 --> 25:34.949
You know, just a couple of photo shoots
and then some kind of testing .

25:35.034 --> 25:37.410
But I guess you know how it works.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.454
I do.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.584
Don't worry.
I'm not going to ruin this.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.502
I'm very happy for you .

26:08.525 --> 26:10.652
I know you don't like it.

26:12.321 --> 26:16.449
But I know you're
a little bit proud of me.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.457
Come upstairs.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.541
No.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.878
Right here.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.300
Okay.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.915
How are these open already?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.710
Well, Betty, we don't want life
to look difficult, now do we?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.464
You're too much .

27:36.905 --> 27:37.864
No! No!

27:39.033 --> 27:40.533
Polly, no!

27:40.617 --> 27:41.784
Let it go.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.710
If I see that dog in my yard again ,

27:50.794 --> 27:52.045
I'm going to shoot it.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.395
I see you got there and back in one piece.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.064
Yes.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.732
And even though I got lost,

28:12.816 --> 28:14.650
I sent Ethel home at 4.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.781
They went to the park,
then to visit Ernie at Francine's.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.283
All in all , everyone had a nice day.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.577
So how was it?

28:24.661 --> 28:25.661
There was this man Ronnie.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.580
I don't even know what his job is.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.625
Ronnie Gittridge.
He's the art director. I've met him .

28:30.709 --> 28:32.543
He is such a character.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.587
He tells funny stories.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.631
I brought the form home.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.966
I thought you could
help me fill it out

28:39.051 --> 28:40.802
so I can get paid .

28:40.886 --> 28:42.512
I'd love to.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.779
Sweetie pie.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.197
What happened?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.574
I had a bad dream .

29:05.452 --> 29:06.702
Get in bed with Daddy.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.421
What was your dream?

29:16.505 --> 29:19.715
I don't want anyone to shoot Polly.

29:21.343 --> 29:23.261
No one is going to do that, honey.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.513
Yes. Mr. Brestwood said he would

29:25.597 --> 29:28.599
because Polly ate one of his doves.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.102
They're pigeons.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.646
And he said this to you in your dream?

29:33.730 --> 29:36.816
No, he said it today
when Polly ate the birdie.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.361
She wasn't hurt that bad .
She could fly.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.159
No one is going to hurt Polly.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.622
Good night, honey.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.136
Now they can't play in the yard?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.683
I'm going to get my robe on

30:10.767 --> 30:12.685
and go over there
and find out what happened .

30:12.769 --> 30:13.978
2 in the morning .

30:14.062 --> 30:16.689
He's our neighbor.You'll make it worse.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.358
I'll talk to him .

30:19.443 --> 30:22.570
You should have Ethel talk to him .

30:22.654 --> 30:24.739
Don, they play in the yard
when I'm here, too.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.199
And she didn't tell you?

30:26.283 --> 30:28.993
I'm sure they didn't tell her.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.079
They probably wouldn't
have told me, either.

30:33.916 --> 30:37.001
There'll be over at Francine's
for the next shoot anyway.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.669
It's one day.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.798
I'm sure it wasn't that bad .

30:46.261 --> 30:47.803
Maybe not.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.017
She'd never slept well .

30:54.311 --> 30:56.103
That's not true.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.984
Did you see those big tears?

31:04.112 --> 31:07.240
I really want to get a picture
of her crying one day.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.745
I have to say, Don ,

31:12.829 --> 31:15.748
Lucky Strike, even in this lawsuit,
is stronger than ever.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.667
It was a brilliant campaign ,

31:17.751 --> 31:21.128
like some supersonic jet
flying right over the market.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.512
I was there,
Great work.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.682
Thank you .

31:32.766 --> 31:35.851
Sorry to interrupt.
Who is responsible?

31:36.979 --> 31:39.313
We've made a significant commitment

31:39.398 --> 31:42.066
for as-yet unproduced
Secor laxative commercials.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.693
This didn't go by me.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.737
No, it went by Bob Wilkins
in Media, right to me.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.864
Who is responsible?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.203
Mr. Cooper, sir, it was me.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.497
You thought of this?

31:56.582 --> 31:58.541
Well , uh . . .

31:58.625 --> 32:00.876
I bear some of the responsibility as well .

32:00.961 --> 32:02.378
What did they do?

32:02.462 --> 32:07.717
Every commercial block on air
in the Land of Lincoln

32:07.801 --> 32:11.971
is clogged up with laxative buys.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.808
And a little bit of Nixon time.

32:15.892 --> 32:20.730
The Kennedy people won't know
what to do with themselves.

32:20.814 --> 32:25.818
They're going to have
to put his pretty face on the radio.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.570
And with that accent.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.988
Nicely done.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.907
I didn't think you had it in you,
and I mean that.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.784
- Thank you ,
- Thank you .

32:33.869 --> 32:36.287
Inspired .

32:37.956 --> 32:39.915
Congratulations, boys.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.252
Peggy, you want to write that down?

32:43.337 --> 32:46.672
Don said congratulations.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.675
Are we done here?

32:49.760 --> 32:50.843
No.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.558
I really thought

32:57.643 --> 32:59.727
it was going to go bad for a minute.

32:59.811 --> 33:00.895
I was sure it would .

33:00.979 --> 33:02.855
No kidding .
You almost let me detonate

33:02.939 --> 33:04.523
a thousand feet from the ground .

33:04.608 --> 33:06.609
So much for camaraderie.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.029
Mr. Rumsen sent this over.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.866
Unopened . Very nice.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.869
Hildy, stay. Have a drink. It's an order.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.120
No, thank you .

33:18.205 --> 33:20.665
I'm going to my parents' after work.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.875
You know, when something
good happens to me,

33:22.959 --> 33:24.251
it also happens to you .

33:24.336 --> 33:25.920
I know that.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.172
I said congratulations.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.883
You should do something
with that sour puss.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.301
You're very beautiful .

33:34.971 --> 33:37.056
Just being honest.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.392
I love watching you walk.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.228
I should go.

33:43.689 --> 33:44.897
You should .

34:43.665 --> 34:45.207
Is he in?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.005
Always nice to see you .

34:53.175 --> 34:54.800
I'd give you my assurance

34:54.885 --> 34:56.719
that nothing good will happen to that boy,

34:56.803 --> 34:58.971
but I can't seem
to keep my word on that,

34:59.055 --> 35:00.139
hard as I try.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.392
I might ask you to take me with you .

35:03.477 --> 35:05.519
I see no reason to leave.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.357
Or maybe I see a million .

35:10.442 --> 35:12.985
A million? Is that
what it's going to cost me?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.987
I was thinking more like 40.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.822
45 is good .

35:24.164 --> 35:27.666
I'm not going to be a little girl
and ask you why you stayed .

35:27.751 --> 35:29.001
I know it's not money,

35:29.085 --> 35:32.004
and I hope it's not to keep
your foot on Pete Campbell .

35:32.088 --> 35:33.798
I like the way you do business.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.675
Well, I try to be
as civilized as you can be.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.011
No contract.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.430
45 and no security.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.098
What's in it for me?

35:44.184 --> 35:50.856
If I leave this place one day,
it will not be for more advertising .

35:50.941 --> 35:53.526
What else is there?

35:53.610 --> 35:55.736
I don't know. Life being lived .

35:57.113 --> 35:59.949
I'd like to stop talking about it
and get back to it.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.034
I've worked with a lot of men like you ,

36:02.118 --> 36:06.455
and if you had to choose a place to die,
it would be in the middle of a pitch.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.748
I've done that.

36:12.963 --> 36:15.005
I want to do something else.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.061
Jim Hobart, McCann Erickson .

36:29.145 --> 36:30.271
Of course.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.233
Line 1 .

36:38.113 --> 36:39.071
Don,

36:39.155 --> 36:41.198
incredible pictures, am I wrong?

36:41.283 --> 36:42.908
No, you're not.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.869
So, your wife's already here with us.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.078
I know she's happy.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.329
Why don't you join her?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.332
I don't know about that, Jim .

36:50.417 --> 36:51.959
You can do better than that.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.086
You know what I'm offering here?

36:54.170 --> 36:56.088
It's Yankee Stadium . I know.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.466
What, did Sterling come to the rescue?

36:59.551 --> 37:00.885
If this is about money,

37:00.969 --> 37:03.470
I have to say I might
have judged you wrong.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.014
It's not.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.473
I'm surprised .

37:06.558 --> 37:09.560
I thought your wife coming here
meant you were interested .

37:09.644 --> 37:11.979
No, that was her idea.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.231
Can't blame me for trying .

37:14.316 --> 37:16.650
Maybe not, but, uh . . .

37:18.320 --> 37:21.196
I can't exactly say
that was a big league move.

37:23.199 --> 37:26.452
All's fair. No stone unturned , right?

37:28.288 --> 37:31.332
It's a pity to lose both of you.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.375
You're a very lucky man,
landing that woman .

37:45.639 --> 37:47.473
What's going on with Mr. Draper?

37:47.557 --> 37:51.143
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you .

37:51.227 --> 37:52.603
Very good .

37:52.687 --> 37:55.147
I've been meaning
to give this back to you .

37:55.231 --> 37:56.815
I had it completely dry cleaned .

37:58.485 --> 37:59.735
Why don't you keep it?

37:59.819 --> 38:02.154
Have it taken in here and let out there.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.656
It's your dress.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.825
Hot tea. That's a good idea.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.453
What are you talking about?

38:10.622 --> 38:16.418
Peggy, you are falling prey
to a very common situation for new girls.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.045
I'm not new anymore.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.588
Well, that's just it.

38:19.673 --> 38:22.174
Don't you want to do well here?

38:22.258 --> 38:27.888
I'm the first girl to do any writing
in this office since the war.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.181
Marge told me.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.183
Writing?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.476
Is that what this is about?

38:32.560 --> 38:35.270
I thought you were doing that
to get close to Paul .

38:36.606 --> 38:38.357
Thank you . Again .

38:41.486 --> 38:43.529
I heard you were being
considered for an account

38:43.613 --> 38:45.030
because a client's wife saw you

38:45.115 --> 38:47.408
and thought it would be okay
if he worked with you .

38:47.492 --> 38:49.201
You know, you're not a stick.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.912
And yet I never wonder
what men think of me.

38:51.997 --> 38:56.291
You're hiding a very attractive young girl
with too much lunch .

38:56.376 --> 38:58.419
I know what men think of you :

38:58.503 --> 39:02.381
that you're looking for a husband ,
and you're fun,

39:02.465 --> 39:04.758
and not in that order.

39:06.219 --> 39:07.302
Peggy, this isn't China.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.304
There's no money in virginity.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.391
I'm not a virgin .

39:14.978 --> 39:17.730
No. Of course not.

39:19.816 --> 39:22.234
I just realized something.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.739
You think you're being helpful.

39:26.823 --> 39:30.325
Well , I am trying, dear.

39:33.455 --> 39:34.997
I'm going home.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.844
Did you have a good day?

39:48.928 --> 39:51.096
I did . It was splendid .

39:51.181 --> 39:54.683
Well, Betty, I have some good news
and some bad news.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.311
There's bad news?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.606
The client's moving
the international work to London .

40:00.690 --> 40:02.274
Oh .

40:02.358 --> 40:06.153
More Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.279
I see.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.363
As for us,

40:08.448 --> 40:10.365
we're all going back to the malt shop.

40:10.450 --> 40:14.244
The good news is you have two
wonderful sets of pictures

40:14.329 --> 40:15.537
to start your book again .

40:15.622 --> 40:17.289
That's true.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.249
I really am sorry.

40:21.294 --> 40:22.628
This was fun .

40:22.712 --> 40:25.297
You can keep the dress
and the hairstyle.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.382
I don't do that for everyone.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.387
Oh, honey,

40:32.472 --> 40:35.140
it has nothing to do with you .

40:54.619 --> 40:55.786
Thank you .

40:58.665 --> 40:59.832
What do you think, Paul?

40:59.916 --> 41:01.291
Should we move this whole thing

41:01.376 --> 41:02.334
down to MacDougal Street?

41:02.418 --> 41:04.044
We're doing great here.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.260
It's good she left.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.512
It probably wasn't
going to happen for her tonight.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.180
It depends how much we drink.

41:16.349 --> 41:18.142
How drunk do you have to be?

41:19.894 --> 41:21.812
My brother works at the Exchange.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.356
They call a girl like her a lobster.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.858
All the meat's in the tail .

41:30.280 --> 41:32.114
Are they giving you guys a bonus?

41:38.663 --> 41:40.330
Would you calm down?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.876
Come on!

41:47.213 --> 41:48.630
Drop you at the station?

41:48.715 --> 41:50.215
Sure.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.063
Campbell, you sucker-punched me.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.481
What is wrong with you?

42:07.567 --> 42:08.692
Come on .

42:12.822 --> 42:14.948
You just had a fight,

42:15.033 --> 42:17.451
and I was not part of it.

42:17.535 --> 42:22.039
Either you two make up,
or I do not stand a chance tonight.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.008
Perfect timing .

42:34.219 --> 42:35.636
The children are down ,

42:35.720 --> 42:38.430
but only because they were
running around all day.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.432
They fell asleep in front of the TV.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.643
How did it go today?

42:42.727 --> 42:45.229
Good . Fun .

42:45.313 --> 42:48.523
They were talking about a whole string
of other possibilities for me.

42:50.568 --> 42:55.030
But honestly,
I don't think I want to work anymore.

42:56.908 --> 43:02.454
I don't like you coming home to some. , .
whipped-together mess

43:02.538 --> 43:05.707
of whatever's left in the fridge.

43:05.792 --> 43:10.963
And frankly, I don't like
Manhattan on my own .

43:12.507 --> 43:13.548
It's harsh .

43:17.387 --> 43:19.471
It can be.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.306
And what am I going to do?

43:21.391 --> 43:23.684
Run around the city with my book,

43:23.768 --> 43:26.561
like some teenager,
making a fool of myself?

43:28.815 --> 43:31.483
If that's what you want,

43:31.567 --> 43:33.860
and it's my job
to give you what you want.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.279
You do.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.992
Look at all this.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.745
I don't know what I was thinking .

43:50.461 --> 43:54.047
Birdie, you know I don't care

43:54.132 --> 44:00.470
about making my dinner
or. . .taking in my shirts.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.014
You have a job.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.684
You're mother to those two little people,

44:05.768 --> 44:08.729
and you are better at it
than anyone else in the world .

44:13.776 --> 44:15.610
At least in the top 500.

44:22.618 --> 44:26.455
I would have given anything
to have had a mother like you .

44:28.041 --> 44:30.625
Beautiful and kind . . .

44:30.710 --> 44:33.754
filled with love like an angel .

44:35.423 --> 44:36.757
You're sweet.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.901
And this does not taste whipped-up.

44:55.985 --> 44:59.654
No. It's good , isn't it?

45:13.169 --> 45:14.503
Have a good day, Daddy.

45:14.587 --> 45:15.545
You , too.

45:15.630 --> 45:16.588
Have a good day.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.591
We're going to the community center
to watch them fill the pool.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.009
That sounds fun.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.095
Have a good day.

45:23.179 --> 45:24.679
I already am .

45:30.311 --> 45:32.771
Mommy, I'm eating .

45:47.703 --> 45:50.705
Be careful.
Don't jump off the bed .

45:50.790 --> 45:53.166
Okay!

46:24.240 --> 46:27.742
Mrs. Draper,
what the hell are you doing?

46:29.287 --> 46:31.455
Mrs. Draper!
