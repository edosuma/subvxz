00:02.601 --> 00:05.901
My situation is that
SHIELD is under attack by the Hulk.

00:05.902 --> 00:08.002
I didn't attack the helicarrier!

00:08.003 --> 00:10.703
I know.
We'll prove your innocence.

00:10.704 --> 00:12.604
Turn to Banner.

00:12.905 --> 00:14.905
Go with them.
Trust me.

00:17.906 --> 00:19.606
You lied to the Avengers!

00:19.607 --> 00:21.207
All using my face!

00:21.208 --> 00:23.908
The Skrulls turned you against each other.

00:24.509 --> 00:25.809
Broken frienships...

00:25.810 --> 00:29.110
Broken trust take much longer to heal.

00:31.311 --> 00:33.311
Are you people out of your minds!

00:33.312 --> 00:35.012
This new Hulkbuster base...

00:35.013 --> 00:37.913
is the most secure facility
ever built by human hands.

00:37.914 --> 00:40.314
It exists to keep the world safe.

00:40.315 --> 00:43.015
And i'm not gonna let you
people deturn me from that mission.

00:43.016 --> 00:45.716
You mission was a success, General Ross.

00:45.717 --> 00:48.217
But the president has agreed that
the man you're holding here...

00:48.218 --> 00:50.718
is no longer considered a threat to anyone.

00:52.119 --> 00:54.319
What?
He's a monster!

00:54.320 --> 00:56.920
How would come the president
into believing otherwise?

00:56.921 --> 01:00.321
We used things called facts
You should try it sometimes.

01:00.322 --> 01:03.622
It's over, General.
Bruce Banner is a free man.

01:10.423 --> 01:12.023
This is insane!

01:12.024 --> 01:15.024
The Hulk is a threat to every
man and woman alive!

01:15.725 --> 01:18.425
The Hulk was lied to an manipulated
into turning himself in...

01:18.426 --> 01:20.426
by an alien terrorist.

01:20.427 --> 01:22.027
posing as me.

01:22.028 --> 01:25.328
Not only is he innocent
but as far as i'm concerned...

01:25.629 --> 01:28.729
- he is a hero!
- you have no idea of what you're doing!

01:28.730 --> 01:31.330
Release him and i promise you...

01:31.331 --> 01:33.331
the results will be disastrous!

01:33.632 --> 01:36.332
Shut down the gamma dampers
and get him out of here.

01:52.033 --> 01:53.333
Bruce?

01:55.033 --> 01:56.333
Hey, Cap.

01:56.334 --> 01:59.034
My surrender would have done great
didn't it?

01:59.035 --> 02:01.335
Banner, we're here to get you out

02:02.136 --> 02:03.736
Bruce, stay calm!

02:05.137 --> 02:06.437
We lost him.

02:09.437 --> 02:10.437
Hulk!

02:12.739 --> 02:14.839
Bring it back on line, all of it!

02:46.942 --> 02:48.942
Congratulations, Captain.

02:48.943 --> 02:52.943
You've just freed the deadliest man alive.

02:54.444 --> 02:57.026
Subtitles : Nakor38

02:57.027 --> 02:59.080
And there came a day unlike any other

02:59.081 --> 03:00.840
When Earth's Mightiest Heroes...

03:00.841 --> 03:03.481
found themselves united against a common threat.

03:03.482 --> 03:06.708
on that day, they became the Avengers

03:06.709 --> 03:08.763
The Invincible armored Iron Man

03:08.764 --> 03:11.012
Thor Prince of Thunder

03:11.013 --> 03:13.750
The Hulk,strongest hero there is

03:13.751 --> 03:16.977
and Captain America the first Avenger

03:16.978 --> 03:20.302
Assembled we are strong!

03:20.303 --> 03:23.726
Forever fight as one!

03:23.727 --> 03:26.173
Avengers, Assemble!

03:27.074 --> 03:28.974
Folks, the Hulk is off the grid.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.575
Plus he's dangerous
and as far as i can tell...

03:31.576 --> 03:33.176
he's completely out of his mind.

03:34.477 --> 03:36.777
We need everyone in *** room ASAP.

03:38.478 --> 03:40.578
Finding the Hulk is priority number one.

03:40.579 --> 03:42.879
Even at his worse,
we've never seen him like this.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.880
I don't know if the isolation of the prison
drove him nuts, or what.

03:45.881 --> 03:49.181
Whatever the reason,
it's our responsability to bring him in.

03:49.182 --> 03:50.682
I know how this looks...

03:50.683 --> 03:53.183
But i still give Hulk 
the benefit of the doubt.

03:53.184 --> 03:56.484
Ross and the Hulkbusters want nothing less
than his total destruction.

03:56.485 --> 03:58.085
But he's still one of us.

03:58.086 --> 04:00.586
Indeed, the Hulk has been a valuable ally.

04:00.587 --> 04:03.887
And not one i look forward to facing
in battle once again.

04:04.188 --> 04:06.388
*** Thor

04:06.389 --> 04:09.289
For now, i've got world wide sat scan
trying to track him.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.790
As soon as we have a localized position
we're heading out.

04:15.190 --> 04:16.790
Understand.

04:16.791 --> 04:19.491
We have to be prepared in case
things go south.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.791
If we have to, we'll take him down.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.993
But only as a alast resort.

04:24.494 --> 04:27.494
Sir, i intercepted a HulkBusters transmission.

04:27.495 --> 04:30.195
They found the Hulk in the Niagara Falls area.

04:30.196 --> 04:32.196
Geeneral ROss and his team are on route.

04:32.197 --> 04:34.197
Let's go, maybe we can beat them there.

04:34.798 --> 04:36.598
They came to help us.

04:37.399 --> 04:38.999
They lied to us!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.600
Something's wrong.

04:45.901 --> 04:48.601
The transformation...
it was forced.

04:48.602 --> 04:51.102
It wasn't triggered by either one of us.

04:51.403 --> 04:53.303
We trusted them!

04:57.704 --> 04:59.304
I know you did.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.605
And i'm asking you to trust us again.

05:01.606 --> 05:03.206
Let us help you.

05:04.207 --> 05:06.707
I... don't need...any help...

05:07.508 --> 05:09.508
from you!

05:10.709 --> 05:12.709
Hulk, we fought together.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.310
Side by side.

05:14.611 --> 05:15.911
I want to help you.

05:15.912 --> 05:17.212
But you need to...

05:44.213 --> 05:46.213
I had hoped it wouldn't come to this.

05:46.214 --> 05:48.914
Avengers, take him.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.615
Just remember, he's not the enemy.

05:58.616 --> 06:00.416
*** friend Hulk

06:00.417 --> 06:01.717
I do not wish to hurt you.

06:11.618 --> 06:13.718
As you can see, i came dressed for the party.

06:22.519 --> 06:24.319
Avengers, now!

06:41.320 --> 06:44.320
- Wait, are we hurting him?
- Are you kidding?

06:45.821 --> 06:47.821
Cap, i've got Ross on line.

06:48.522 --> 06:51.222
Stand out Captain
We are taking him in.

07:10.623 --> 07:11.923
You!!!

07:12.324 --> 07:14.124
I'm not going to fight you, Hulk.

08:00.125 --> 08:02.125
No need for that.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.826
I came to help.

08:05.627 --> 08:06.927
You.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.928
Hear me out, Captain...

08:08.929 --> 08:12.429
I don't know if you're in the market
for new Avengers...

08:12.430 --> 08:15.130
But i'd like to sign up, if you'll have me.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.731
You've all heard of the green Hulk.

08:22.732 --> 08:24.332
Well, if one wasn't enough...

08:24.333 --> 08:26.133
a new Hulk has arrived.

08:26.134 --> 08:27.634
a red Hulk

08:27.635 --> 08:31.335
And while any Hulk is enough to make the world
a little nervous...

08:31.836 --> 08:33.936
This Hulk has spent the week...

08:33.937 --> 08:37.636
demonstrating his honest desire
to serve humanity...

08:37.638 --> 08:38.938
as one of its heroes.

08:39.639 --> 08:41.239
What's your story, red Hulk?

08:41.240 --> 08:45.540
I'm far from perfect.
I've made my mistakes.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.341
I've been brainwashed...

08:47.342 --> 08:50.042
and forced to do things i'm not proud of.

08:50.043 --> 08:52.343
But i'm not a monster.

08:52.344 --> 08:54.944
Now, i just want to help.

08:54.945 --> 08:56.945
I don't care what he wants to prove...

08:56.946 --> 08:58.946
Or what he does for the sake of the cameras...

08:58.947 --> 09:02.047
A Hulk is a Hulk is a Hulk!
green, red or blue!

09:02.048 --> 09:03.348
doesn't matter.

09:03.349 --> 09:05.949
We've already got one in custody
and when this one screws up...

09:05.950 --> 09:08.650
We'll lock him in with Banner
and throw away the key!

09:08.651 --> 09:10.251
It's a very strange day...

09:10.252 --> 09:13.752
when i find myself actually agreeing
with Thunderbolt Ross.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.753
He can't deny that our new red friend
has been living up to his word.

09:16.954 --> 09:18.354
That's putting it mildly.

09:18.355 --> 09:21.755
Seems that everytime we turn around
he's on the news for some new heroics.

09:22.856 --> 09:24.956
So both of you are buying into this?

09:24.957 --> 09:27.457
We've all made ***
at some point, Cap.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.258
Besides he willingly submitted himself
to a full body scan...

09:30.259 --> 09:33.259
which did show evidence
of possible mind control in his past.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.360
This is a mistake.

09:35.761 --> 09:38.361
Think about what this team
deals with on a daily basis.

09:38.362 --> 09:39.662
Having a Hulk on the roster?

09:39.663 --> 09:42.863
Specially one that won't take your head off
if someone puts too much cream in his coffee?

09:42.864 --> 09:45.664
That's fire power we can use.

09:45.665 --> 09:49.365
And what about Bruce?
Do we just leave him locked up?

09:50.066 --> 09:52.766
- You saw him, Cap.
- Yes i did.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.767
And you, of all people, Wasp...

09:54.768 --> 09:56.468
You should know better!

09:56.469 --> 09:58.769
We don't give up on friends!

10:01.370 --> 10:04.070
Let's just put it to a vote.
Majority rules

10:05.771 --> 10:07.071
Fine.

10:11.772 --> 10:13.772
While it might not have been unanimous...

10:13.773 --> 10:15.073
a decision has been made

10:15.074 --> 10:16.574
And it's time to make it official.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.675
With his recent actions, the red Hulk...

10:18.676 --> 10:20.676
has more than made up for his past transgressions.

10:20.677 --> 10:23.677
With the presentation of this Avengers ID card...

10:23.678 --> 10:26.478
we proudly announce the red Hulk
will be joining our ranks.

10:26.479 --> 10:27.979
Effective immediately.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.280
Don't leave home without it, pal.

10:33.781 --> 10:37.181
Thank you, Iron Man.
And to the rest of the Avengers...

10:37.182 --> 10:39.882
Who supported me on this proud occasion.

10:39.883 --> 10:42.183
Come on guys, say it once to the cameras

10:42.184 --> 10:43.984
- Yeah come on guys.
- We want to hear it!

10:43.985 --> 10:45.685
Avengers, assemble!

10:46.686 --> 10:48.286
So, where is Captain America?

10:48.287 --> 10:51.887
JARVIS, i want to know about the red Hulk.

10:51.888 --> 10:53.488
I want to know who he is.

10:53.489 --> 10:57.989
All that exists are the statistics that were gathered 
during the initial screening process

10:57.990 --> 11:00.290
Strength levels.
Radiation power.

11:00.291 --> 11:01.791
Intelligence quotients.

11:02.077 --> 11:03.761
What i saw in the field...

11:03.762 --> 11:05.822
his strategic mind in approach to combat...

11:05.823 --> 11:09.024
- suggests military training.
- entirely possible, sir.

11:09.417 --> 11:12.054
If he was so intent 
on showing himself as a hero...

11:12.055 --> 11:14.664
He could have approached us anytime.

11:15.139 --> 11:17.758
But he waited for a specific moment.

11:17.759 --> 11:21.183
A moment when the Hulk was
on an uncontrollable rampage.

11:21.184 --> 11:23.565
Sir, you are no longer alone.

11:24.456 --> 11:27.138
Missed you at the adoption ceremony.

11:29.273 --> 11:33.197
Look i know that maniac was a friend of yours.

11:33.198 --> 11:36.772
But you were nuts to have that monster
around in the first place.

11:37.314 --> 11:39.345
Just worry about yourself.

11:39.346 --> 11:41.579
I'll be keeping a close eye on you.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.298
Maybe this is something
you want to take up with me...

11:46.930 --> 11:48.816
personally.

11:48.817 --> 11:50.231
Here you are.

11:50.232 --> 11:52.908
Try not to wander off when
i'm giving you the nickel tour.

11:52.909 --> 11:54.516
Sorry Hawkeye.

11:54.517 --> 11:57.322
I got curious.
Let's go.

13:12.117 --> 13:15.322
I apologize for the short notice, Avengers.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.598
But something has come up
that demands our immediate attention.

13:20.369 --> 13:25.156
I'm afraid that one of our teammates
has gone off the reservation.

13:25.716 --> 13:30.535
That my friends
is an illegal act in progress.

13:30.536 --> 13:33.473
- Cap?
- Is that Banner's cell?

13:33.474 --> 13:35.476
He plans to release the beast?

13:35.477 --> 13:39.109
Avengers... assemble.

13:40.814 --> 13:44.030
Banner, Banner!
wake up, come on!

13:48.430 --> 13:50.360
What did they do to him?

14:01.505 --> 14:02.628
Wasp!

14:02.629 --> 14:04.396
Sorry i played stowaway, Cap...

14:04.397 --> 14:06.521
But i kept thinking about what you said.

14:06.522 --> 14:08.656
You're right
i should know better.

14:08.657 --> 14:10.646
So, i'm here to help, if i can.

14:10.647 --> 14:12.390
Your timing couldn't be better.

14:12.391 --> 14:15.625
I need you to investigate
the implant in Banner's head.

14:27.753 --> 14:30.914
OK, i'm no scientist 
but there's some sort of ...

14:31.922 --> 14:34.900
it looks like there's a device connected to his brain.

14:34.901 --> 14:37.800
Right,
but who planted it?

14:37.801 --> 14:39.329
and why?

14:40.640 --> 14:42.601
Wasp, get out of there!

14:49.373 --> 14:51.119
Cap, i could feel it.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.315
Some sort of high frequency signal.

14:53.699 --> 14:56.260
- Less talk, more action.
- Right.

15:04.566 --> 15:05.900
Hulk.

15:06.795 --> 15:08.846
It wasn't you.

15:09.316 --> 15:11.579
You didn't betray me.

15:11.580 --> 15:14.662
- Did you?
- No, i didn't.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.626
But the implant.
Who did this to you?

15:21.217 --> 15:22.787
Captain America...

15:22.788 --> 15:25.456
for treason against the United States government,

15:25.457 --> 15:28.286
for aiding and ***
a known super criminal,

15:28.287 --> 15:30.442
you are under arrest.

15:30.443 --> 15:34.967
You can either surrender peacefully
or you can resist.

15:35.427 --> 15:38.320
Please, resist.

15:54.527 --> 15:57.227
I know you had a reason, Cap
make it a good one please.

15:57.228 --> 15:59.220
We caught this out of Hulk's skull.

15:59.221 --> 16:01.216
An implant wired into his brain.

16:01.217 --> 16:03.696
Remote controlled to send him into a rage.

16:07.687 --> 16:10.929
Oh great, this is based on old Stark
*** tech,

16:10.930 --> 16:13.110
I sold to the militaries years ago.

16:18.171 --> 16:21.137
You'll have to do better than that, ugly.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.868
I won't need to.

16:23.869 --> 16:27.258
I'll content to let you destroy yourself

16:36.021 --> 16:37.432
No!

16:40.519 --> 16:42.496
Let's move, Avengers!

16:46.894 --> 16:49.795
Don't you get it?
you're old news.

16:49.796 --> 16:53.000
They don't want a psycho,
they want a soldier.

16:53.001 --> 16:55.744
We've already got one,
Thanks

16:59.855 --> 17:01.457
I'll crush you!

17:01.964 --> 17:05.323
No, this is about you and me.

17:06.143 --> 17:07.914
They head for the surface.

17:07.915 --> 17:10.005
Wait, he dropped something.

17:16.563 --> 17:19.292
I think i found Hulk's angry button.

17:19.294 --> 17:22.588
A remote trigger
and guess who was holding it?

17:47.552 --> 17:50.698
So, this entire time,
the red Hulk was manipulating us...

17:50.699 --> 17:53.382
blaming the Hulk
and making himself look lige a hero?

17:53.383 --> 17:56.808
- Yeah, and we fell for it.
- Not exactly.

17:59.104 --> 18:01.512
Allow me to school you in the art of war.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.973
First lesson:
There's always casualties!

18:35.897 --> 18:38.571
You waste your time saving civilians...

18:38.572 --> 18:40.162
when there's a mission to complete.

18:40.163 --> 18:42.041
You are too soft!

18:48.928 --> 18:51.771
It would appear your reckoning
has arrived, traitor.

18:51.772 --> 18:53.962
Hold on, Thor, that's not how we deal
with a fellow Avenger...

18:53.963 --> 18:55.324
who's gone rogue.

18:55.325 --> 18:57.285
First things first, red Hulk.

18:57.286 --> 18:59.395
I need you to turn in your ID card.

18:59.396 --> 19:01.262
This piece of junk?

19:01.263 --> 19:03.057
You people are a joke.

19:03.058 --> 19:06.266
In a week, i would have been running things.

19:06.267 --> 19:07.775
Sure you would have.

19:07.776 --> 19:10.472
Initiating self replicating
containment agents.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.416
***
but i don't think you'd believe...

19:13.417 --> 19:15.521
I would just blindly trust
that red screwball.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.882
That's a little nanoform
high density containment compound...

19:18.883 --> 19:20.499
I cooked up.

19:21.431 --> 19:24.279
No, you can't do this!

19:24.280 --> 19:26.176
A little insurance, just in case...

19:26.177 --> 19:28.724
you wouldn't exactly ***

19:32.200 --> 19:34.931
- General Ross?
- get out!

19:34.932 --> 19:37.488
This whole thing was Rosse's way
of discrediting the Hulk.

19:37.489 --> 19:40.717
- But how did he...
- Ross, it was you.

19:40.718 --> 19:43.283
Always you!

19:48.887 --> 19:51.282
- Don't do it, Hulk!
- HoldWait

19:52.705 --> 19:55.828
Hulk, we know you're not a monster.

19:55.829 --> 19:57.556
Let him go.

20:06.030 --> 20:09.739
Hulk knows a real monster 
when he sees one.

20:11.489 --> 20:14.234
You can't do this to me
i was serving my country!

20:14.235 --> 20:15.863
That beast needs to be contained...

20:15.864 --> 20:17.933
and i'm the only man who can do it.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.845
Hope there's no hard feeling, Hulk.

20:20.846 --> 20:23.507
You have to admit,

20:23.508 --> 20:26.146
Whatever, i'm still mad.

20:26.147 --> 20:28.633
Well, yeah, you're the Hulk.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.673
You guys should take a sweet time to help me.

20:31.674 --> 20:33.673
Except for you.

20:34.075 --> 20:36.098
That's what friends are for.

20:36.099 --> 20:38.006
I figured i owed you.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.387
Don't worry, i checked mine too.

20:44.388 --> 20:46.189
Totally *** free.

20:46.190 --> 20:48.173
Welcome back, big guy.

20:48.174 --> 20:49.623
Eu não seiI don't know

20:49.624 --> 20:53.126
I think i wanna be left alone for a while.

20:54.133 --> 20:57.039
But i you need me, call.

20:59.729 --> 21:01.082
After all...

21:01.827 --> 21:04.216
What are friends for, right?

21:05.305 --> 21:11.785
