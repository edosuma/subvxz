03:01.044 --> 03:03.706
Stop!
Stop the bus!

03:15.692 --> 03:18.286
The story of my life is not
for the faint of heart.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.558
Thanks.

03:20.597 --> 03:22.895
But, like any story
worth telling,

03:22.933 --> 03:24.992
it's all about a girl.

03:26.003 --> 03:28.233
Not that girl.

03:28.272 --> 03:31.070
- Hey. Hi.
- I don't think that is a girl.

03:31.108 --> 03:33.599
No, it's about this girl...

03:33.644 --> 03:35.612
Jill Johnson.

03:35.646 --> 03:39.639
Ever since I can remember
I've been in love with her,

03:39.683 --> 03:41.207
but she barely knows
I exist.

03:41.251 --> 03:42.980
Yo, Rick!
Yo, come here, man!

03:43.020 --> 03:44.749
I got you a seat
down here. What's...

03:44.788 --> 03:46.221
I'll call y'all back.
Everybody, bye.

03:46.256 --> 03:47.917
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Trey.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.858
Dude, I'm so psyched
for this class trip.

03:49.893 --> 03:51.861
We about to see some real
serious cutting-edge shit.

03:51.895 --> 03:53.726
Mmm.
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

03:53.764 --> 03:55.391
That's what
I'm talking about.

03:55.432 --> 03:57.423
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs?

03:57.467 --> 03:59.992
Got that new sandwich
from Sony in my backpack.

04:00.037 --> 04:01.299
Wi-Fi... mmm!

04:02.539 --> 04:05.337
Yo! You got to forget
about her, dawg.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.366
Look look.
Let me show you something.

04:07.411 --> 04:10.005
She not even
looking at you.

04:10.047 --> 04:11.912
If I could just
tell her how I feel.

04:11.949 --> 04:13.974
Look, Rick, I already told you...

04:14.017 --> 04:15.712
you never gonna get
with Jill, all right?

04:15.752 --> 04:17.447
Seriously, she hangs out
with the popular crew,

04:17.487 --> 04:19.921
and nobody messes around
outside their group, man.

04:19.957 --> 04:22.289
Come on, that crew stuff
isn't real.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.351
The hell it ain't.
Look around, Rick.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.259
- Look, you got your jocks...
- Get the ball, man.

04:26.296 --> 04:28.787
...nerds, emos,

04:28.832 --> 04:31.096
Frodos,

04:31.134 --> 04:33.568
the Scarface society...

04:33.604 --> 04:36.300
...the sexual predators.
- Yeah.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.900
- Of course you got the Rick punchers.
- The who?

04:38.942 --> 04:41.740
- Oh!
- Yeah, they new.

04:41.778 --> 04:43.541
Mm-hmm. But you know what?
Who cares?

04:43.580 --> 04:45.548
'Cause we got our own crew...
me and you.

04:45.582 --> 04:47.413
Thanks, Trey.
You're the best, man.

04:48.685 --> 04:50.243
- Am I in?
- No.

04:50.287 --> 04:52.346
Come on.
Hey, it's me and you, baby.

04:52.389 --> 04:54.016
The two of us against the world.
You hear me?

04:54.057 --> 04:55.490
You look good today.
I like your hair.

04:55.525 --> 04:57.152
I'm gonna show you
something nasty I downloaded.

04:57.194 --> 04:58.821
Don't tell nobody.

05:00.664 --> 05:02.291
Welcome to Amalgamated.

05:02.332 --> 05:04.323
I'm Dr. Strom,
head of the research department...

05:04.368 --> 05:07.337
- Come on, man.
...where we create the future today.

05:07.371 --> 05:10.738
And now I'd like
to show you our crown jewel.

05:10.774 --> 05:13.834
The Amalgamated
animal genetics lab.

05:13.877 --> 05:16.107
Whoa.

05:16.146 --> 05:18.444
Go ahead, explore.

05:18.482 --> 05:20.245
Yo yo. Come on, Rick.
Man, check this out.

05:20.284 --> 05:23.651
All of our animals are
genetically engineered

05:23.687 --> 05:26.247
and each of them has...

05:26.290 --> 05:28.258
Oh, you're so pretty.

05:28.292 --> 05:31.125
Hi, birdie.

05:31.161 --> 05:33.527
Hi. Hi.

05:34.865 --> 05:38.699
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

05:40.337 --> 05:42.430
Uh, I'm gonna take
a picture of her

05:42.472 --> 05:44.167
for the school newspaper.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.334
Our only rules: Don't feed the animals

05:46.376 --> 05:49.174
and please,
no flash photography.

05:50.714 --> 05:52.841
Some of our genetically-
engineered animals

05:52.883 --> 05:54.851
are a little sensitive
to light.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.246
It flew away.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.826
Uh... whoo-hoo.

06:07.831 --> 06:09.856
What the F, loser?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.596
Get him, Lance.
- Come on, Lance.

06:12.636 --> 06:15.901
- Leave him alone.
- I don't think so.

06:15.939 --> 06:18.737
Is there
a problem, Lance?

06:18.775 --> 06:22.506
No. No problem,
Uncle Lou.

06:22.546 --> 06:24.639
Mr. Landers!

06:24.681 --> 06:27.206
Students,
this is Lou Landers,

06:27.250 --> 06:30.378
visionary scientist
and C.E.O. of Amalgamated.

06:30.420 --> 06:33.150
Well, I'm just
a businessman now.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.454
The future of science

06:35.492 --> 06:37.585
belongs to all of you.

06:37.627 --> 06:40.596
Please, enjoy the tour.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.506
Are you okay?

06:50.540 --> 06:53.634
Yes, this is
healthy-cough blood.

06:55.245 --> 06:59.511
Rick Riker. You're not Blaine and Julia
Riker's son, are you?

06:59.549 --> 07:02.541
- I am.
- Ah. Good people.

07:02.586 --> 07:05.851
- How are they?
- They died violently nine years ago.

07:05.889 --> 07:07.720
But otherwise okay?

07:07.758 --> 07:11.558
Yes, thank you.
I live with my aunt and uncle now.

07:11.595 --> 07:14.428
Well, you seem
like a real chip off the old block.

07:14.464 --> 07:16.762
Let's hope you're not
violently murdered too.

07:23.106 --> 07:25.939
That's for making me look stupid.

07:25.976 --> 07:28.274
Next time
I hurt you.

07:28.311 --> 07:31.246
Yeah.
You the man, Lance.

07:34.851 --> 07:36.876
Our work with these animals
has helped us develop

07:36.920 --> 07:40.117
new antibiotics,
advanced pesticides

07:40.157 --> 07:43.991
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate

07:44.027 --> 07:46.427
called compound H2O0.

07:46.463 --> 07:49.023
It's a strong
sexual attractant.

07:49.066 --> 07:52.001
A single drop is enough
to arouse any animal.

07:52.035 --> 07:55.766
We plan on using it to breed
endangered species.

07:55.806 --> 07:59.537
A special and indeed
often overlooked...

07:59.576 --> 08:02.545
Our most-promising research

08:02.579 --> 08:04.774
is with these dragonflies.

08:04.815 --> 08:07.249
For example,
this dragonfly's skin

08:07.284 --> 08:09.650
has a hard,
armor-like exoskeleton

08:09.686 --> 08:11.119
to defend against...

08:11.154 --> 08:12.883
And this species
of dragonfly

08:12.923 --> 08:15.153
has enormous strength
for its size.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.818
It can lift vast amounts.

08:18.862 --> 08:21.126
More than it's body weight.

08:21.164 --> 08:24.725
And here we've injected the DNA
from all three species

08:24.768 --> 08:27.202
into seven
new genetically-enhanced

08:27.237 --> 08:29.068
super dragonflies.

08:29.106 --> 08:31.973
But there's
only six in there.

08:32.008 --> 08:35.466
Well, one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns.

08:35.511 --> 08:37.809
I lost six tigers alone
last month.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.183
Ah!

08:42.219 --> 08:45.552
This area is where
we keep our livestock.

08:50.594 --> 08:52.585
Ohh.

08:54.197 --> 08:56.324
Aren't you going
to do something?

08:56.366 --> 08:58.027
Soon as I get
this up on YouTube.

09:05.675 --> 09:09.702
I see. Ye... well,
yes, I understand.

09:09.746 --> 09:11.976
Thank you
for the call.

09:12.015 --> 09:14.506
That was
the principal.

09:14.551 --> 09:16.849
Rick walked off
a class trip.

09:16.887 --> 09:19.913
After all the parenting
you've done,

09:19.956 --> 09:21.924
he's still so troubled.

09:21.958 --> 09:24.119
Why do you think
that is, Albert?

09:25.495 --> 09:27.224
I have no idea,
Lucille.

09:27.264 --> 09:29.892
I have taught him everything I know
about being a man.

09:29.933 --> 09:32.231
And a good man you are

09:32.269 --> 09:34.499
after all these years
of marriage.

09:34.538 --> 09:36.096
It's like we first met.

09:36.139 --> 09:38.505
Sure, you're
a little older.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.237
Your hair's grey.

09:40.277 --> 09:41.676
You have crow's feet.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.271
It takes you
an hour to pee.

09:44.314 --> 09:46.544
Your thighs look
like cottage cheese

09:46.583 --> 09:48.551
someone threw up
on a hot sidewalk.

09:48.585 --> 09:52.282
And you've always had
a tiny penis.

09:53.657 --> 09:57.115
Well... what does it matter
when you're in love?

10:00.130 --> 10:02.462
Oh, Rick.

10:02.499 --> 10:04.933
We were wondering
where you were.

10:04.968 --> 10:07.163
It's so late.

10:08.772 --> 10:11.969
About time you got home.
Your aunt was getting worried.

10:12.008 --> 10:14.238
You can sleep late
in the morning,

10:14.277 --> 10:17.178
but don't forget
to feed the fish.

10:18.515 --> 10:20.710
Attaboy.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.720
I don't know.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.881
Something just doesn't seem
quite right with him today.

10:26.923 --> 10:29.687
Teenagers.
I'll talk to him.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.566
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to you.

10:37.601 --> 10:39.569
Puberty is
a difficult time

10:39.603 --> 10:41.594
in a young man's life.

10:41.638 --> 10:44.801
Now this book may explain
what's happening.

10:44.841 --> 10:48.470
Let's see.
There are mood swings, fluid retention,

10:48.511 --> 10:51.708
and once a month you'll bleed
from your vagina.

10:52.716 --> 10:55.014
This may be
the wrong book.

10:55.051 --> 10:57.918
What's important is that you're on
the verge of adulthood.

10:57.954 --> 11:01.014
Here...
take a drink.

11:01.057 --> 11:03.685
Ah, the rituals
of manhood.

11:03.727 --> 11:05.456
Today you have
your first beer,

11:05.495 --> 11:07.463
and tomorrow
we'll circumcise you.

11:17.340 --> 11:20.309
I'm losing patience,
Dr. Strom.

11:20.343 --> 11:22.504
Please, sir, if you could just
wait a few minutes...

11:22.545 --> 11:24.308
I've waited long enough
for this egomaniac.

11:24.347 --> 11:26.315
We're the board of directors.
Our time is valuable.

11:26.349 --> 11:28.408
Not as valuable
as mine, Mr. Carlson.

11:28.451 --> 11:32.182
You see, I have
a terminal illness.

11:32.222 --> 11:34.417
I've been
fighting it for years,

11:34.457 --> 11:37.358
but the disease has
ravaged my organs.

11:37.394 --> 11:41.023
As of this moment,
I have one hour left to live.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.065
It was on sale.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.998
Gentlemen, if you're ready,

11:50.040 --> 11:52.634
allow me
to show you the future.

11:53.910 --> 11:55.673
Strom.

12:00.884 --> 12:03.717
From the... lift it ov...
lift it over!

12:07.524 --> 12:09.924
What the hell
is that?

12:09.959 --> 12:12.291
An innovation...
thank you...

12:12.329 --> 12:14.320
that will not only
save my life

12:14.364 --> 12:16.355
but the life
of this company.

12:16.399 --> 12:20.028
For too long we've scraped out profits
from pills and injections.

12:20.070 --> 12:22.834
The real prize is
the total cure.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.705
A device
that can alter DNA

12:25.742 --> 12:27.710
and restore the body
to perfect health.

12:27.744 --> 12:30.042
- You're crazy.
- No.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.777
Crazy is hearing voices,
talking to cats,

12:33.817 --> 12:35.682
dating Paula Abdul.

12:35.719 --> 12:38.779
I'm not crazy.
I'm a visionary!

12:38.822 --> 12:40.790
Sir.
Sir, the machine's

12:40.824 --> 12:43.258
never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong...

12:43.293 --> 12:45.625
- Start the machine!
- Yes, sir.

12:51.735 --> 12:53.794
Plasma level
is steady.

12:53.837 --> 12:56.101
Genetic modification's
at optimum levels!

12:56.139 --> 12:58.903
Sir, the core is overheating.

12:58.942 --> 13:01.740
- Ah!
- We have to abort!

13:07.817 --> 13:10.945
Did it work?

13:10.987 --> 13:13.979
I'm so sorry.

13:14.023 --> 13:16.321
Well, well, well.

13:16.359 --> 13:18.589
I want you to know
what a joy it will be

13:18.628 --> 13:21.290
running this company
without you in the way.

13:23.133 --> 13:25.931
Let go.
Let me go.

13:48.958 --> 13:53.156
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made
some personnel changes.

13:54.631 --> 13:56.758
No, stay away!

14:11.414 --> 14:14.850
Oh. How long
was I asleep?

14:14.884 --> 14:18.513
Five days.

14:32.302 --> 14:33.860
Huh.

15:29.726 --> 15:31.455
Wait.
Wha...

15:40.737 --> 15:42.329
Oh, Dad.

15:48.111 --> 15:50.739
I thought
you'd live forever.

16:07.697 --> 16:08.994
Oh.

16:48.237 --> 16:50.296
Breakfast, Rick!

16:51.574 --> 16:53.474
I'll be right down!

16:56.512 --> 16:58.139
Oh!

17:07.022 --> 17:09.150
If I can have your attention.

17:09.192 --> 17:12.855
We are delighted to have
as guest judge

17:12.895 --> 17:15.227
the foremost scientist
in the world.

17:15.263 --> 17:18.700
He's a visiting professor
at Empire City University

17:18.734 --> 17:21.499
where he's working
with the rare element cerillium.

17:21.537 --> 17:25.165
I am so proud to welcome
Dr. Stephen Hawking.

17:31.781 --> 17:34.511
Thank you for that warm welcome.

17:34.550 --> 17:37.144
I have a disease
that has paralyzed me.

17:37.186 --> 17:41.418
I cannot walk and I use
this computer to speak.

17:41.457 --> 17:46.156
But I am not depressed,
because I have the gift of knowledge.

17:46.195 --> 17:50.461
That's a lie.
I think about suicide every day.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.799
But you should all be happy
with your lives.

17:53.836 --> 17:56.930
You can walk, talk,
wipe your own asses

17:56.973 --> 17:58.838
and then there's
all the sex.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.867
I haven't had sex in years.

18:01.911 --> 18:05.540
My nurse is a lesbian,
and not the hot kind.

18:06.683 --> 18:09.345
Hey, anyone want
to get high?

18:09.385 --> 18:12.081
- I've got some hash with me.
- No way.

18:12.121 --> 18:14.681
White guy
in the dreads,

18:14.724 --> 18:16.817
you know
what I'm talking about.

18:16.859 --> 18:18.724
Can I get a what what?

18:18.761 --> 18:20.092
Holla.

18:20.129 --> 18:23.098
I've got a stiff pole
for your sweet hole.

18:24.267 --> 18:26.758
Anyone? Anyone?

18:26.803 --> 18:28.395
Pussies.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.929
Dr. Hawking,
I am such a fan.

18:30.973 --> 18:33.942
I'd love to show you
my project on supernovas.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.439
You have an incredible ass...

18:37.480 --> 18:40.347
...stromony career
ahead of you.

18:54.197 --> 18:56.165
Wait, where's Saturn?

18:56.199 --> 18:57.757
I'd hate to lose
my father's bowling ball.

18:59.535 --> 19:01.264
There it is.

19:01.304 --> 19:03.636
Great reflexes.

19:06.809 --> 19:08.777
You have
very manly hands.

19:08.811 --> 19:11.006
So do you.

19:11.047 --> 19:14.505
I'm gonna go find a spot
for my project.

19:14.550 --> 19:16.279
Yeah, okay.

19:36.139 --> 19:38.403
Watch where you're going
in slo-mo, dipshit.

19:38.441 --> 19:40.204
- Pfft.
- Yeah.

19:42.678 --> 19:44.441
Go to her, stupid.

19:45.715 --> 19:47.649
Tell her how you feel.

20:07.069 --> 20:08.263
Yow.

20:10.206 --> 20:11.571
Any day.

20:11.607 --> 20:13.438
Uh... he did it.

20:16.379 --> 20:17.744
Ow!

20:17.780 --> 20:20.271
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Get him, Lance!

20:20.316 --> 20:22.546
- Lance, stop it.
- Kick his ass, Lance!

20:22.585 --> 20:25.076
Fight fight fight!

20:25.121 --> 20:27.351
- Let's see what you got.
- Fucking break him!

20:28.424 --> 20:31.086
Whoa!

20:31.127 --> 20:32.924
Oh!

20:34.831 --> 20:35.991
Damn!

20:37.800 --> 20:39.461
Ooh!

20:49.545 --> 20:51.479
Get off!

20:51.514 --> 20:53.812
Get... get off me!

20:53.850 --> 20:55.545
Yah!

20:58.287 --> 21:01.518
Ow. Ow. Ow.

21:06.062 --> 21:08.690
Shit shit shit shit.

21:40.663 --> 21:42.893
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

21:42.932 --> 21:44.729
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did #

21:44.767 --> 21:47.235
# Oh no, you didn't, didn't,
Oh no, you didn't #

21:47.270 --> 21:49.670
- # Oh yeah, we did #
- # Oh no, you didn't, didn't #

21:49.705 --> 21:51.536
- # Oh no, you didn't #
- # Oh yes, we did. #

21:56.879 --> 21:58.540
Stop! Stop! Hey!

22:02.585 --> 22:04.610
Get out of the way!
No brakes!

22:08.357 --> 22:10.086
Get out of the way!

22:10.126 --> 22:12.026
Ma'am, look out!

22:17.066 --> 22:19.057
Are you okay?

22:30.913 --> 22:33.404
- How did you...
- I can't believe it.

22:33.449 --> 22:35.747
- You just saved that old lady's life.
- Amazing.

22:35.785 --> 22:38.948
l... I guess.
If I hadn't pushed her out of the way,

22:38.988 --> 22:40.512
she would've die... ah!

22:51.267 --> 22:53.428
You should be really proud of yourself.

22:53.469 --> 22:55.630
You're some kind of hero.

22:55.671 --> 22:57.104
If you could excuse me.

23:01.077 --> 23:04.376
There we go. Awfully nice of you
to help me out here, Trey.

23:04.413 --> 23:07.314
Oh, no problem.
I'm waiting on Rick, anyway, so...

23:08.417 --> 23:10.385
Ooh.

23:10.419 --> 23:12.444
My God.

23:12.488 --> 23:14.513
How did you do that?

23:14.557 --> 23:17.754
Uh, it's easier
than it looks.

23:22.298 --> 23:24.323
No, I don't think so.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.801
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

23:26.836 --> 23:30.135
All right. Well,
there is something, okay?

23:30.172 --> 23:32.640
But you have to
keep it a secret.

23:35.177 --> 23:38.578
I think I have...
superpowers.

23:38.614 --> 23:40.673
I find that
hard to believe.

23:40.716 --> 23:42.411
All right, all right,
how about this?

23:42.451 --> 23:44.043
Go ahead and throw
as many punches as you want.

23:44.086 --> 23:46.520
I bet you 100 bucks
you don't land one.

23:48.891 --> 23:51.291
Easy money.

23:51.327 --> 23:53.761
What else can you do?

23:53.796 --> 23:56.094
I don't know.
l... I was bitten by a dragonfly.

23:56.132 --> 23:59.761
Well, some dragonflies
have armored skin.

23:59.802 --> 24:02.396
I wonder if my skin is...

24:03.906 --> 24:06.466
Well, good thing
that worked.

24:07.476 --> 24:09.137
So you do have
superpowers.

24:09.178 --> 24:11.373
We could be a team!

24:11.414 --> 24:13.848
We gonna
get fame, money...

24:13.883 --> 24:17.114
- Don't forget the bitches.
- There's not gonna be fame

24:17.153 --> 24:19.348
and there's not
gonna be bitches, okay?

24:19.388 --> 24:22.619
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.

24:22.658 --> 24:24.751
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

24:25.928 --> 24:27.862
You're not my father.

24:27.897 --> 24:29.728
But I love you
like your father did.

24:29.765 --> 24:31.665
I believe in you
like your father did.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.965
I had sex with your mother just
like your father did.

24:35.004 --> 24:38.030
Huh. You'll never
understand me.

24:38.074 --> 24:41.510
Never.

24:53.289 --> 24:55.917
That isn't what
your parents wanted for you.

24:59.929 --> 25:02.762
What a great performance.

25:02.798 --> 25:04.561
Well, Rick,
did you enjoy the opera?

25:10.673 --> 25:13.642
Son, is something
troubling you?

25:13.676 --> 25:16.076
It's so unfair.
They have nothing.

25:16.112 --> 25:18.979
Why do we have $2 billion?

25:19.014 --> 25:21.141
Well, your grandfather
left us $3 billion

25:21.183 --> 25:22.514
and I made some
bad investments.

25:22.551 --> 25:24.576
But that's nothing for you
to worry about.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.815
But I want
to change things.

25:26.856 --> 25:29.347
And you will.
Five generations of Rikers

25:29.391 --> 25:31.621
have worked hard to make
this city great.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.493
One day, Rick, people will look
to you to be a hero.

25:34.530 --> 25:37.294
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

25:37.333 --> 25:38.800
Give me your wallet.

25:38.834 --> 25:40.825
That too.

25:43.572 --> 25:46.006
People will look to you to be a hero.

25:46.041 --> 25:49.033
When that day comes,
will you be ready?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.177
Rick!

25:56.752 --> 25:57.741
Ah!

26:00.356 --> 26:01.448
Ow!

26:04.560 --> 26:05.857
Huh? Ah!

26:05.895 --> 26:07.795
Rick, please!

26:09.031 --> 26:10.191
Ah!

26:18.040 --> 26:21.874
- Dad!
- Oh, Rick, I'm dying.

26:21.911 --> 26:23.538
- No!
- Don't worry.

26:23.579 --> 26:25.103
My brother Albert
will take you in.

26:25.147 --> 26:28.583
Rick, the money,
it's all yours now.

26:28.617 --> 26:31.848
Sell all shares of a small company
called Google.

26:31.887 --> 26:35.880
It's worthless.
Invest heavily in Enron.

26:35.925 --> 26:38.894
Rick, I have
something for you.

26:38.928 --> 26:41.920
Reach into
my coat pocket.

26:41.964 --> 26:45.058
The other coat pocket.

26:47.503 --> 26:48.629
God!

26:50.439 --> 26:52.407
That ring
was my father's

26:52.441 --> 26:54.705
and his father's
before him.

26:54.743 --> 26:57.268
Earn it, Rick.
Be a hero.

26:57.313 --> 26:59.281
Claim your...

27:02.785 --> 27:04.776
- destiny.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.344
Dad!

27:11.227 --> 27:13.092
I'm no superhero.

27:13.128 --> 27:15.790
I'm nobody!

27:15.831 --> 27:17.321
Ah!

27:17.366 --> 27:20.028
Shut up back there! I'm gonna kill you!

27:33.816 --> 27:36.785
- Are you okay?
- What, you heard that?

27:36.819 --> 27:40.084
You're nothing but an ugly,
ungrateful little whore!

27:40.122 --> 27:42.317
Just like your mother!

27:42.358 --> 27:44.758
- Who was that?
- My mother.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.990
Listen, about what happened
at school this morning, l...

27:48.030 --> 27:49.292
You really freaked us out.

27:49.331 --> 27:51.299
I'm really going through
a tough time right now.

27:51.333 --> 27:54.598
Me too. My parents,
they want me to go to college,

27:54.637 --> 27:57.333
but I want
to be a dancer.

27:57.373 --> 27:58.965
I believe in you.

27:59.008 --> 28:01.670
You really do,
don't you?

28:01.710 --> 28:04.304
I wish I could say
the same for Lance.

28:04.346 --> 28:06.109
I don't know.
Is he the right one

28:06.148 --> 28:08.810
or am I just dating him
to rebel against my father?

28:08.851 --> 28:11.217
He doesn't want any boy near me.

28:11.253 --> 28:13.585
That's why he installed
the electrified fence.

28:13.622 --> 28:16.819
Well, we'll see.
You can't run from your destiny.

28:16.859 --> 28:18.884
- Right?
- Right.

28:20.029 --> 28:23.760
- Jill, let's go!
- Nice car.

28:23.799 --> 28:27.530
Maybe one day you could take me
for a ride in your car.

28:29.004 --> 28:30.494
Uh...

28:32.708 --> 28:34.835
Uh, yeah.

28:34.877 --> 28:36.777
Yeah, definitely.

28:43.118 --> 28:46.884
Oh. Lovebirds.

29:13.248 --> 29:15.716
Rick, this is
Professor Xavier.

29:15.751 --> 29:19.414
Your powers are growing,
but you can't control it.

29:19.455 --> 29:22.083
It's important that you...

29:22.124 --> 29:25.787
become a hero...
train yourself to fly...

29:27.329 --> 29:29.559
...in your ass because...

29:29.598 --> 29:32.123
...squatting
on a glass table...

29:32.167 --> 29:35.625
...two girls...
one cup...

29:35.671 --> 29:38.003
You know what to do.

29:48.984 --> 29:52.715
- This shouldn't take long.
- Well, I'll be waiting right here.

29:52.755 --> 29:54.279
Hello, Mr. Bailey.

29:54.323 --> 29:56.416
I've reviewed your request
for a loan, Mr. Riker,

29:56.458 --> 29:58.892
but with no job,
no credit history,

29:58.927 --> 30:01.122
I'm afraid
I have to say no.

30:01.163 --> 30:02.630
But what about this?

30:03.699 --> 30:05.826
That was last month.

30:06.902 --> 30:08.961
This new promotion's
proving quite popular.

30:09.004 --> 30:10.904
Look, I need
to buy a car.

30:10.939 --> 30:13.965
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst
applicant we've ever had.

30:14.009 --> 30:16.773
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson.

30:18.147 --> 30:22.413
This is a good boy.
There must be something I could do.

30:22.451 --> 30:24.043
Ma'am...

30:24.086 --> 30:27.180
rubbing my crotch under the desk
won't change my mind.

30:27.222 --> 30:29.122
I'm not rubbing
your crotch.

30:30.492 --> 30:32.426
I really need that car.

30:32.461 --> 30:34.326
I don't see
how that's my problem.

30:34.363 --> 30:36.490
This is a robbery! Nobody move!

30:36.532 --> 30:38.830
Everybody stay down!
Stay down!

30:38.867 --> 30:40.334
- Get down.
- Come on, Lady! Hurry it up!

30:40.369 --> 30:43.202
- Oh.
- Come on, move it!

30:46.875 --> 30:49.776
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake
before when I came in.

30:49.812 --> 30:51.302
Thanks.

30:52.815 --> 30:55.875
You idiot! You let him get away
with our money!

30:55.918 --> 30:58.853
I don't see
how that's my problem.

31:01.757 --> 31:05.352
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

31:05.394 --> 31:07.885
Come over here!
You've got to see this.

31:08.897 --> 31:10.990
Let me through.
Let me through.

31:15.270 --> 31:18.933
Oh, thank God. I thought something
terrible had happened.

31:18.974 --> 31:21.670
Well, an old guy did
get shot over there.

31:25.481 --> 31:28.712
Uncle Albert! Just try to breathe.

31:28.750 --> 31:32.447
I can't.
You're kneeling on my balls.

31:32.488 --> 31:34.046
Oh, sorry.

31:34.089 --> 31:36.489
Rick, listen.

31:36.525 --> 31:40.052
With great power comes...

31:40.095 --> 31:41.562
Great responsibility?

31:41.597 --> 31:43.690
I was gonna stick
with bitches,

31:43.732 --> 31:45.700
but if you want to be a virgin
for the rest of your life...

31:45.734 --> 31:47.361
Uncle Albert!

31:47.402 --> 31:49.529
My balls!

31:57.079 --> 31:58.546
Very good.

32:08.490 --> 32:10.185
Oh, God.
Mr. Landers!

32:24.873 --> 32:26.101
Oh no.

32:27.342 --> 32:29.970
Okay.

32:30.012 --> 32:32.537
Hide the body.
Hide the body. Yeah.

32:39.755 --> 32:42.519
Get in!
Yah! Yah!

32:49.298 --> 32:52.597
Okay, I come back.

33:08.350 --> 33:10.250
Jill?

33:10.285 --> 33:12.947
I came as soon
as I heard.

33:12.988 --> 33:16.185
- Where's Aunt Lucille?
- She's at home under heavy sedation.

33:16.224 --> 33:18.784
They made her watch three hours
of women's basketball.

33:18.827 --> 33:22.092
- This is all my fault.
- Rick, it was an armed robbery.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.757
There was nothing
you could've done.

33:23.799 --> 33:26.131
I could've stopped that guy
before he shot my uncle.

33:26.168 --> 33:28.329
Then there is blood
on your hands.

33:28.370 --> 33:31.828
But that's not important. All that matters
is that you're here for him now.

33:31.873 --> 33:34.273
- Rick Riker?
- Yes?

33:34.309 --> 33:36.869
Dr. Whitby.
I've run some tests.

33:36.912 --> 33:39.176
I'm afraid I have bad news.

33:39.214 --> 33:42.115
What is it?

33:42.150 --> 33:43.981
I have an impacted colon.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.954
Whew.
What a night.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.720
Now what brought you
here today?

33:50.759 --> 33:53.319
- My uncle.
- Your uncle brought you?

33:53.362 --> 33:56.490
- No, he's gravely injured.
- Well, then he shouldn't be driving.

33:56.531 --> 33:59.523
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to perform a breast exam.

33:59.568 --> 34:01.832
Doctor, please.
Is my uncle gonna survive?

34:01.870 --> 34:04.896
Well, I don't know.
We should probably have a look.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.668
Hard to say.

34:08.710 --> 34:11.645
Yup, pretty deep coma.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.306
Is he gonna be okay?

34:13.348 --> 34:16.112
Well, I'm not a betting man,
but if you want to put some money on it,

34:16.150 --> 34:18.641
- I'll take "dead in a week."
- Oh my God!

34:18.687 --> 34:20.985
No, it's all right.
It's a normal emotional reaction,

34:21.023 --> 34:23.150
but this should take
the edge off of it.

34:23.190 --> 34:25.351
Here we go.
Nice and easy.

34:25.393 --> 34:29.330
- That's your vein.
- Yes, I know.

34:29.364 --> 34:31.525
First my parents and now this?

34:32.534 --> 34:34.126
I'm nothing
but a screw-up.

34:34.168 --> 34:36.659
Yes, your life has been
a testament to that.

34:36.705 --> 34:39.469
But your uncle believed
in you and so do I.

34:39.507 --> 34:42.806
It's never too late to become the person
you're meant to be.

34:48.984 --> 34:49.184
Rick.

34:49.184 --> 34:50.742
Rick.

34:52.286 --> 34:54.346
Rick.

34:57.959 --> 34:59.017
Hello, Rick.

34:59.061 --> 35:01.552
Who are you and how
do you know my name?

35:01.596 --> 35:03.860
- I'm a psychic.
- Prove it.

35:03.899 --> 35:07.733
Think of any number
between one and a million

35:07.769 --> 35:09.532
and I'll tell you
what it is.

35:10.572 --> 35:12.472
- Nine.
- Not out loud, dumbass!

35:12.507 --> 35:15.067
Follow me...

35:15.110 --> 35:17.078
you dumb son of a bitch.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.248
My name is
Professor Xavier,

35:20.282 --> 35:22.216
and this is my school.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.945
I started it
to help people

35:23.985 --> 35:27.250
with special talents
like yours.

35:27.289 --> 35:30.224
Our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents.

35:30.258 --> 35:33.250
and use them to advance
the common good.

35:36.131 --> 35:37.826
Ah! Ow.

35:37.866 --> 35:41.267
Here we have children
who can walk through walls.

35:41.303 --> 35:43.897
We have children who think they can
walk through walls.

35:43.939 --> 35:47.170
Some faces may be familiar,

35:47.209 --> 35:49.939
like Wolverine.

35:49.978 --> 35:52.503
Other mutants you probably
didn't know existed,

35:52.547 --> 35:55.072
like Sneezo.

35:55.117 --> 35:57.984
Most of our students
are born with their powers.

35:58.019 --> 36:01.250
Some, like you,
gain them later in life.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.382
- Oh, is that...
- Yes, it is.

36:03.425 --> 36:05.586
When he came to this school,

36:05.627 --> 36:07.458
he weighed 130 lbs.

36:07.496 --> 36:09.828
Take enough roids,
you could do anything.

36:11.133 --> 36:13.567
Back up off those pills, Barry!

36:18.707 --> 36:21.835
- Why have you brought me here?
- Because you have the potential

36:21.877 --> 36:24.778
- to be the best.
- But I can't even fly.

36:24.813 --> 36:27.441
Once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

36:27.482 --> 36:30.417
you will fly.
But first I must teach you

36:30.452 --> 36:32.647
the secret
to becoming a superhero.

36:32.687 --> 36:35.383
Hey, Storm! You look
like you putting on a little weight.

36:35.423 --> 36:38.085
Ah! Oh!

36:39.594 --> 36:41.721
So, Professor,
about this secret...

36:41.763 --> 36:43.253
- Well, you see...
- Xavier!

36:43.298 --> 36:46.597
- Aw, shit.
- Well?

36:46.635 --> 36:48.796
You wanna explain
why I found her hiding in your closet?

36:48.837 --> 36:50.702
But, pumpkin,
I don't see nobody.

36:50.739 --> 36:53.071
- Oh, you don't?
- Ow!

36:53.108 --> 36:54.769
Invisible Girl?

36:54.810 --> 36:57.142
Apparently not
invisible enough.

36:57.179 --> 36:59.613
If you knew how to take care of your man,
maybe this wouldn't have happened.

36:59.648 --> 37:01.639
- No, she didn't.
- Oh, this bitch is crazy.

37:01.683 --> 37:03.583
I'm gonna have to
whip your ass.

37:03.618 --> 37:05.609
- You don't say no disrespectful...
- What are you gonna do, baldy?

37:05.654 --> 37:07.554
I'm everywhere,
sweet cheeks.

37:07.589 --> 37:09.853
- Whoa!
- Ow!

37:09.891 --> 37:11.984
- That all you got?
- Yeah!

37:12.027 --> 37:15.622
Now what?
Now how about that, Invisi-bitch?

37:15.664 --> 37:18.030
Yeah, whatever.
I'm out of here.

37:18.066 --> 37:21.001
I'm sure gonna miss her.
She was crazy in the sack.

37:21.036 --> 37:24.199
Biting, scratching, panting,
tongue all over the place.

37:24.239 --> 37:26.070
Wasn't me, asshole.

37:26.107 --> 37:28.439
Come on, Spanky.

37:28.476 --> 37:31.070
I didn't even know
she had a dog.

37:31.112 --> 37:34.206
Still some of the best
sex I ever had.

37:34.249 --> 37:37.446
How could you do this
to me? To your kids?

37:37.485 --> 37:39.783
To your newborn baby?

37:39.821 --> 37:41.618
How do I know
that baby's even mine?

37:41.656 --> 37:44.216
Because he can do this.

37:44.259 --> 37:45.658
Shit!

37:45.694 --> 37:47.719
Ah!

37:47.762 --> 37:49.423
Aw, man.

37:49.464 --> 37:52.365
Now I'm never gonna know the secret
to becoming a superhero.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.392
You wanna know the secret?
Come close.

37:58.373 --> 38:00.466
Make a costume,
shithead!

38:00.508 --> 38:03.909
I swear to God. They get dumber
and dumber every year.

38:05.046 --> 38:07.241
A costume.

38:37.913 --> 38:41.576
Rick, you, uh...

38:43.084 --> 38:44.608
Oh my God.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.417
Damn!

38:47.455 --> 38:50.288
Dude, you're like
a real superhero, man!

38:50.325 --> 38:52.520
I love the mask.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.754
How you breathe
in it though?

38:56.031 --> 38:58.226
What's that sound?

38:58.266 --> 39:01.133
You put some kind
of air intake in the mask.

39:01.169 --> 39:03.137
Boy, you better...
now I'm assuming

39:03.171 --> 39:05.867
that the material is
see-through, right?

39:05.907 --> 39:08.239
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you something.
Rick, this is good.

39:08.276 --> 39:11.507
I'm impressed.
Like really impressed.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.050
Hey, that's my spot.

39:25.093 --> 39:27.561
You're sitting on my gargoyle.
Move it.

39:27.595 --> 39:30.223
- Excuse me?
- What are you even doing here?

39:30.265 --> 39:32.358
I'm looking seriously
out over the city

39:32.400 --> 39:35.301
in a squatting position.

39:35.337 --> 39:37.328
Well, that's what I do here.
So if you're not moving,

39:37.372 --> 39:39.567
I guess we're gonna
have to share.

39:39.607 --> 39:40.767
Uh, okay, fine.

39:40.809 --> 39:43.369
I actually usually
perch in the front.

39:43.411 --> 39:45.971
Oh, all right.
Well, here, you've got to go around.

39:46.014 --> 39:48.539
- Okay, wait.
- Just turn this way. Here we go.

39:48.583 --> 39:50.551
- Dude!
- You're right, I'm sorry. Relax.

39:50.585 --> 39:52.246
- Okay okay.
- Okay okay.

39:54.956 --> 39:57.550
- Uh, I can't perch like this.
- God, me neither.

39:57.592 --> 39:59.651
- What's your name?
- John Storm.

39:59.694 --> 40:02.162
Dragonfly.
So what's your power?

40:02.197 --> 40:04.563
What's my power?
Stand back.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.560
- Flame on!
- Whoa!

40:09.604 --> 40:11.868
Huh?

40:11.906 --> 40:14.773
I'm on fire!

40:14.809 --> 40:17.209
Get a blanket or something!
Holy shit!

40:17.245 --> 40:20.681
It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!

40:22.851 --> 40:24.113
Ah! No! Ah!

40:24.152 --> 40:26.416
God! You idiot, stop!

40:26.454 --> 40:28.422
What's wrong with you?

40:38.333 --> 40:40.597
Sorry, my bad.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.638
Rick, once you understand
the true nature of heroism,

40:49.677 --> 40:51.645
you will fly.

40:54.682 --> 40:57.480
Shit.

41:16.337 --> 41:20.671
This Dragonfly,
he's not even a hero.

41:20.708 --> 41:23.836
He's not... I have... I have...
I have just a... I have...

41:25.213 --> 41:28.182
He can't...
he can't even fly.

41:29.918 --> 41:31.909
The Dragonfly
can't even fly!

41:35.490 --> 41:37.958
I can fly, okay?

41:38.960 --> 41:40.894
I can fly.

41:40.929 --> 41:42.590
This just in:

41:42.630 --> 41:45.224
Tom Cruise is dead.

41:45.266 --> 41:47.734
World's most powerful man.

41:49.137 --> 41:51.833
I have a feeling you might
disagree with that.

41:54.709 --> 41:57.143
Strom, do you have
my test results?

41:57.178 --> 41:59.646
Yes, sir.

42:02.417 --> 42:06.285
Whatever you're doing
to your... victims,

42:06.321 --> 42:09.449
rejuvenates you.
But only for 24 hours.

42:09.491 --> 42:11.288
Hmmm.

42:11.326 --> 42:14.818
What if I killed 28 people
in one session?

42:14.863 --> 42:16.831
Would that give me
a month to live?

42:16.865 --> 42:19.197
If it were February, yes.

42:19.234 --> 42:20.861
But only if your cells
could absorb

42:20.902 --> 42:23.234
that much energy at once,
and they can't.

42:23.271 --> 42:26.331
I'm afraid
you have to kill each day

42:26.374 --> 42:28.308
to live each day.

42:28.343 --> 42:31.005
Still a slave
to the tyranny of time.

42:31.045 --> 42:33.377
There must be some answer.

42:33.414 --> 42:35.382
There isn't.

42:35.416 --> 42:38.010
Unless...

42:38.052 --> 42:41.488
unless you had
some cerillium.

42:41.523 --> 42:44.151
Then you could create
a device powerful enough

42:44.192 --> 42:46.752
to draw the life-force out
of thousands of people

42:46.794 --> 42:49.058
and enhance your own
cellular capacity.

42:49.097 --> 42:51.531
Strom, you're a genius.

42:51.566 --> 42:54.262
Wikipedia.
But that's not important.

42:54.302 --> 42:57.829
What is important is that you
don't have any cerillium.

42:57.872 --> 43:00.102
Besides, it's immoral.
We don't do that sort of thing.

43:00.141 --> 43:01.733
We're a pharmaceutical
company.

43:01.776 --> 43:04.108
Wait a minute.

43:05.513 --> 43:07.606
Take a look.

43:07.649 --> 43:09.412
Hawking's lab is
in the physics building.

43:09.450 --> 43:10.815
I could just
walk right in.

43:10.852 --> 43:14.219
You're going
to steal cerillium?

43:14.255 --> 43:17.713
No, not me.

43:17.759 --> 43:19.420
I'm a law abiding citizen.

43:19.460 --> 43:21.758
But perhaps there's
someone inside me.

43:21.796 --> 43:24.924
Someone unfettered
by the rule of law.

43:24.966 --> 43:29.767
Someone who will,
at any cost, survive!

43:29.804 --> 43:32.068
Ow!

43:32.106 --> 43:34.404
Oh, glass in my eye.
Glass in my eye!

43:34.442 --> 43:37.468
- Does it hurt?
- Uh, yeah, it hurts.

43:37.512 --> 43:41.039
Well, if you could spread...
spread them with your fingers.

43:41.082 --> 43:43.050
Push your lids
with your fingers.

43:43.084 --> 43:44.949
- Two... two... two fingers.
- Are your fingers clean?

43:44.986 --> 43:47.147
That's it. And roll
your eyeball around.

43:47.188 --> 43:48.917
- And push it.
- I'm rolling it!

43:48.957 --> 43:51.255
Dig it out with
another piece of glass.

43:51.292 --> 43:52.987
Are you fricking insane?

43:53.027 --> 43:55.052
I'll get the tweezers.

43:56.698 --> 43:58.996
Read about the Dragonfly,
world's greatest hero.

43:59.033 --> 44:00.660
- Right here?
- Right here, yup.

44:00.702 --> 44:02.192
Read all about it.

44:13.848 --> 44:16.146
No, you listen to me!

44:16.184 --> 44:18.812
I want that story
on my desk or you're fired!

44:18.853 --> 44:20.013
Who the hell are you?

44:20.054 --> 44:22.113
I was wondering if you've
got a job opening for...

44:22.156 --> 44:25.523
Job?! How dare you come in here
and ask me for a job?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.529
I'm the editor in chief!
I know the mayor of Venus!

44:28.563 --> 44:30.758
Hamburgers can see
the future!

44:30.798 --> 44:32.322
- Rosie O'Donnell...
- Sorry about this.

44:32.367 --> 44:34.301
We share the building
with a mental hospital.

44:34.335 --> 44:37.236
Bad news, boss. We're nowhere on
those Dragonfly photos.

44:37.272 --> 44:39.536
Damn. Those were
tomorrow's lead.

44:39.574 --> 44:41.701
What about these?

44:45.013 --> 44:49.347
Wow! it's almost like
you're the Dragonfly.

44:49.384 --> 44:51.011
Uh, no no no.
See?

44:51.052 --> 44:53.486
Look.

44:53.521 --> 44:55.421
Now that's photography.

44:55.456 --> 44:58.152
Just heard on the scanner, some kind
of police standoff at Empire University.

44:58.192 --> 45:01.127
We'll need photos.
Kid, I want you to...

45:01.162 --> 45:03.096
Where'd he go?

45:09.070 --> 45:11.402
Come on, let's go!

45:18.279 --> 45:21.248
This is the chief of police.
We have the building surrounded.

45:21.282 --> 45:22.977
Come out with your hands up.

45:26.187 --> 45:28.587
What the hell is that?

45:42.036 --> 45:44.800
I am the Hourglass.

45:44.839 --> 45:47.865
And your time is up.

45:57.852 --> 45:59.717
Get him, Dragonfly.

46:07.195 --> 46:09.220
It's over, Hourglass.

46:09.263 --> 46:11.925
No, Dragonfly.

46:21.809 --> 46:24.676
It's just begun!

46:26.280 --> 46:28.771
It's useless to resist.

46:28.816 --> 46:30.681
I'll fight you
to my last breath.

46:30.718 --> 46:34.586
Like the sands of time
I am unceasing and relentless.

46:34.622 --> 46:36.522
Evil never triumphs,
Hourglass.

46:36.557 --> 46:39.458
You'll pay for your crimes
and justice will...

46:39.494 --> 46:41.621
stop!
Stop!

46:41.662 --> 46:43.653
Stop!

46:43.698 --> 46:45.996
Are you okay?

46:46.033 --> 46:49.161
No.

46:53.007 --> 46:54.941
Titanium blades.

46:54.976 --> 46:56.671
They cut through diamonds.

46:56.711 --> 46:59.202
I'm not wearing any diamonds.

47:02.049 --> 47:03.710
Ooh, ow!

47:04.819 --> 47:07.049
Ow!

47:07.088 --> 47:10.251
I wish I could stay longer,
Dragonfly.

47:10.291 --> 47:13.624
But I just don't
have the time.

47:19.467 --> 47:23.233
Whoever this Dragonfly is,
he's in over his head.

47:23.271 --> 47:25.432
We don't need so-called
superheroes.

47:25.473 --> 47:27.703
What Empire City needs
is more cops.

47:27.742 --> 47:29.642
And a Hooters.

47:31.679 --> 47:35.115
Titanium blades. Looks like someone
found your weakness.

47:35.149 --> 47:36.673
It's not my weakness.

47:36.717 --> 47:39.948
I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is you can't fly.

47:39.987 --> 47:41.352
Maybe if you had a partner.

47:41.389 --> 47:42.651
I don't need help.

47:46.461 --> 47:49.658
I'm fine all by myself.

47:49.697 --> 47:51.597
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she?

47:51.632 --> 47:53.896
What?
Oh, no.

47:53.935 --> 47:56.529
I mean, she's with
someone else.

47:56.571 --> 47:58.334
Well, maybe
that's for the best.

47:58.372 --> 48:00.169
After all,
it could be dangerous,

48:00.208 --> 48:02.642
you know, being the girlfriend
of the Dragonfly.

48:02.677 --> 48:04.702
I don't know what
to do, Aunt Lucille.

48:04.745 --> 48:06.736
- I love her.
- So be it.

48:06.781 --> 48:08.681
But remember,
to get to you

48:08.716 --> 48:12.379
your enemies will attack
the people you care for the most.

48:12.420 --> 48:16.220
Be careful not to hurt
the ones you love.

48:17.859 --> 48:19.793
And shave your pubes.

48:19.827 --> 48:22.352
No one wants to go down
on a tumbleweed.

48:33.174 --> 48:35.039
Jill!

48:35.076 --> 48:36.475
Rick?

48:36.511 --> 48:38.638
I heard you were auditioning
for a part so...

48:38.679 --> 48:40.647
Oh, they're beautiful.

48:40.681 --> 48:42.945
God, you are so supportive.

48:42.984 --> 48:45.953
Why can't Lance
be more like you?

48:48.055 --> 48:50.649
There's something you're not
telling me, isn't there?

48:50.691 --> 48:52.090
Something secret.

48:52.126 --> 48:54.890
Something locked away
deep inside.

48:54.929 --> 48:57.090
It was summer camp.
We had to share a shower.

48:57.131 --> 48:59.224
You trip and fall with your mouth
open on one guys...

48:59.267 --> 49:00.894
No!

49:00.935 --> 49:04.371
I mean, in here.

49:07.241 --> 49:10.335
Well, there is...

49:11.879 --> 49:14.643
Keep your identity a secret, Rick.

49:16.918 --> 49:19.944
Dude, you're like a real superhero, man!

49:19.987 --> 49:23.320
Once a month
you'll bleed from you vagina.

49:26.394 --> 49:28.123
I...

49:28.162 --> 49:30.289
nothing.

49:31.832 --> 49:34.733
Nothing?

49:37.972 --> 49:39.769
Well, I should go.

49:40.942 --> 49:43.410
You're a good friend.

49:46.480 --> 49:46.581
Hey, check this out.

49:46.581 --> 49:49.709
Hey, check this out.

49:49.750 --> 49:51.615
Oh, shit.

49:53.588 --> 49:55.681
- Let's go.
- Get her.

50:37.264 --> 50:39.528
Oh God, it hurts.
It hurts.

50:39.567 --> 50:42.161
Please stop!
I'm begging you!

50:56.350 --> 50:58.978
Wait!

51:00.655 --> 51:03.647
- Where are you?
- Behind you.

51:05.926 --> 51:07.951
You saved my life.

51:07.995 --> 51:10.361
Do I get to thank you?

51:53.374 --> 51:55.638
Go.
Be a hero.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.689
Yeah.

52:24.905 --> 52:26.896
It looks like you're planning
a mass murder.

52:26.941 --> 52:28.806
Would you like help?

52:28.843 --> 52:30.435
Paper clip guy.

52:46.660 --> 52:49.959
I'm so happy that you
and your boyfriend

52:49.997 --> 52:51.988
are spending Thanksgiving
with us.

52:52.032 --> 52:53.966
Of course, Lucille.

52:54.001 --> 52:55.901
You need support
at a time like this.

52:55.936 --> 52:59.463
Yes, I miss seeing
my Albert each morning.

52:59.507 --> 53:01.839
You know, 50 years
of marriage

53:01.876 --> 53:03.810
creates quite a bond.

53:03.844 --> 53:05.641
I wish I knew love
like that.

53:05.679 --> 53:07.408
Oh, you will, dear.

53:07.448 --> 53:10.144
You just have to
follow your heart.

53:10.184 --> 53:12.948
That's the thing.
I don't know if I can.

53:12.987 --> 53:14.682
Oh, Jill.

53:14.722 --> 53:18.249
If you can't trust yourself
who can you trust?

53:18.292 --> 53:20.021
I know.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.051
But what if my heart
is telling me to be with someone

53:22.096 --> 53:23.461
I can't be with?

53:23.497 --> 53:25.260
It's not just any guy.
It's the...

53:25.299 --> 53:27.597
forget it.
You'll think I'm crazy.

53:27.635 --> 53:29.193
No, of course not.

53:29.236 --> 53:31.204
You can tell me anything.

53:31.238 --> 53:33.297
I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

53:33.340 --> 53:35.934
You'll think it's
ridiculous, but...

53:35.976 --> 53:38.308
it's the Drag...

53:38.345 --> 53:39.869
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

53:42.116 --> 53:45.051
Hey, babe.

53:45.085 --> 53:48.282
Oh, I forgot to tell you
I kinda invited my uncle.

53:48.322 --> 53:51.587
- Your uncle?
- What? Set another plate.

53:51.625 --> 53:53.525
Well, okay.
I guess.

53:53.561 --> 53:57.019
Miss Johnson. Please,
excuse my nephew's poor manners.

53:57.064 --> 54:00.090
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.

54:00.134 --> 54:02.159
I hope this isn't
too much of an imposition.

54:02.203 --> 54:05.070
Oh, of course not.
There's always room for one more.

54:05.105 --> 54:06.402
Thank you.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.533
It's just Thanksgiving
is for family.

54:08.576 --> 54:10.510
Lance is the only family
I have.

54:10.544 --> 54:12.478
- I never married.
- Fruitcake?

54:12.513 --> 54:14.845
Nope, just never met
the right woman.

54:14.882 --> 54:18.716
Ah, yes, Lance told me
Rick Riker was your neighbor.

54:18.752 --> 54:20.447
Where is Rick?

54:23.190 --> 54:25.750
That's odd.

54:25.793 --> 54:28.887
I thought he was out.
I'll go check on him.

54:28.929 --> 54:31.557
Please, you're busy.
Allow me.

54:31.599 --> 54:34.124
Thank you.
Upstairs, second door to the right.

54:51.185 --> 54:53.016
Rick?

55:03.831 --> 55:05.628
Hmmm.

55:14.575 --> 55:15.906
Hmmm.

56:32.653 --> 56:35.383
Sorry I'm late.

56:35.422 --> 56:38.255
Oh, Mr. Landers.

56:38.292 --> 56:40.089
Rick.

56:40.127 --> 56:42.061
No, you're just on time.

56:42.096 --> 56:44.291
Everybody,
take your seat.

56:44.331 --> 56:45.855
Ohhh.

56:45.899 --> 56:48.868
Ah ah ah!
Not till we say grace.

56:48.902 --> 56:50.665
Jesus!

56:50.704 --> 56:52.103
Amen.

56:53.707 --> 56:55.334
Please start,
everyone.

56:55.376 --> 56:57.310
This all looks
so delicious, Lucille.

56:57.344 --> 57:00.245
We have Rick
to thank for it.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.874
Ever since Albert...

57:02.916 --> 57:06.079
Rick has been supporting me
with his new job.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.384
New job?
You didn't tell me.

57:08.422 --> 57:12.415
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's
unofficial photographer.

57:15.729 --> 57:17.356
What happened to your arm?

57:19.099 --> 57:20.999
Uh...

57:21.035 --> 57:23.526
a bike messenger
knocked me down.

57:24.772 --> 57:26.899
I see
your wrist is bandaged.

57:26.940 --> 57:29.909
Yes, I burned it
on some hot coffee.

57:29.943 --> 57:31.911
And you have a cut on your lip.

57:31.945 --> 57:33.879
Uh...

57:33.914 --> 57:36.610
my crackpipe broke.

57:38.085 --> 57:40.485
You have a scratch
on your neck.

57:40.521 --> 57:42.921
Yes, I...

57:42.956 --> 57:45.754
met a girl
on Craigslist.

57:45.793 --> 57:47.852
And you have a bruise
on your neck.

57:47.895 --> 57:49.829
I...

57:49.863 --> 57:52.161
met a guy
on Craigslist.

57:54.935 --> 57:57.460
I'm sorry, Lance.
We have to go.

57:57.504 --> 57:59.995
- Why?
- I...

58:00.040 --> 58:02.031
shat my pants.

58:03.477 --> 58:05.342
I'll drive.

58:19.259 --> 58:21.819
- Thanks for helping clean up.
- Of course.

58:21.862 --> 58:24.558
Poor thing's so tired.

58:24.598 --> 58:27.260
Yeah, well, you know
old folks after a big meal.

58:27.301 --> 58:30.236
So... you know the Dragonfly?

58:30.270 --> 58:32.033
Uh...

58:32.072 --> 58:33.733
yeah, I guess.

58:33.774 --> 58:36.038
You could sorta say
we're close.

58:36.076 --> 58:39.443
Has he...
has he ever asked about me?

58:39.480 --> 58:41.471
Um, yeah.

58:41.515 --> 58:43.983
- Yeah, once.
- What did you tell him?

58:45.486 --> 58:47.351
Well, I said...

58:47.387 --> 58:48.479
I told him...

58:49.556 --> 58:52.423
I told him, "The thing
about Jill is...

58:52.459 --> 58:55.917
when you look in her eyes
and she looks back in yours...

59:00.467 --> 59:02.162
- you know that
you'd do anything

59:02.202 --> 59:04.830
anything to be a better person
than you are.

59:04.872 --> 59:06.464
So that...

59:07.875 --> 59:10.901
- if you were ever
lucky enough to be with her,

59:10.944 --> 59:13.970
you could earn every second
of her perfect...

59:20.854 --> 59:23.948
- grace,
and her limitless beauty...

59:28.996 --> 59:30.987
- and her unending love.

59:33.333 --> 59:34.823
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

59:34.868 --> 59:36.768
My eyes are burning.

59:38.639 --> 59:40.368
Rick, I want you to know

59:40.407 --> 59:42.398
that was the most
beautiful thing

59:42.442 --> 59:44.273
anyone's ever said to me.

59:49.917 --> 59:52.511
- Scented candle?
- Thank you.

59:53.921 --> 59:57.379
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet...

59:58.926 --> 01:00:01.258
- I know exactly
what I want.

01:00:20.547 --> 01:00:23.277
Sorry to drop in uninvited.

01:00:23.317 --> 01:00:26.480
It's okay. We were hoping someone
would open a window.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.988
It was getting stuffy
in here.

01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:32.549
So this is the lair
of the Dragonfly.

01:00:32.593 --> 01:00:35.494
- How did you...
- No no no,

01:00:35.529 --> 01:00:39.898
I'm not here to fight you. I've got
thousands of other people I plan to kill.

01:00:39.933 --> 01:00:43.164
This little visit
is just to show you

01:00:43.203 --> 01:00:46.730
who'll get hurt
if you get in my way.

01:00:46.773 --> 01:00:48.741
Never!

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.419
Time to go.

01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:11.520
The woman, Lucille Adams
of East Empire City,

01:01:11.565 --> 01:01:13.965
- was badly injured.
- How was she injured?

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:15.832
- Badly.
- What about the Dragonfly?

01:01:15.869 --> 01:01:17.860
All I can tell you is this:

01:01:17.904 --> 01:01:20.168
he didn't save
anyone tonight.

01:01:20.207 --> 01:01:22.641
Doctor, how is she?

01:01:22.676 --> 01:01:25.110
I'm afraid your aunt's
taken a turn for the worse.

01:01:25.145 --> 01:01:28.239
She can't speak, she can't walk,
she had no control over her bowels.

01:01:28.282 --> 01:01:29.647
That's... that's awful.

01:01:29.683 --> 01:01:32.174
I know. I went ahead and set up
a MySpace page for her

01:01:32.219 --> 01:01:34.779
under "crazy shit machine."

01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:36.448
She already has 40 friends.

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:38.788
Wait a minute.
That's somebody else's aunt.

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:41.089
Your aunt has no problem
with her bowels...

01:01:41.128 --> 01:01:43.062
- Oh, thank God.
...because she's dead.

01:01:43.096 --> 01:01:46.259
I'm truly sorry, Rick,
but there is a silver lining.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.632
Your uncle came out
of his coma this morning.

01:01:48.669 --> 01:01:49.897
He did?

01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:52.928
Yes, but you mustn't tell him about
your aunt just yet.

01:01:52.973 --> 01:01:55.942
He's in a delicate mental state.
The slightest bit of bad news

01:01:55.976 --> 01:01:58.604
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma.

01:01:58.645 --> 01:02:00.442
I understand.

01:02:02.616 --> 01:02:05.016
Mr. Adams,
you have a visitor.

01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:08.112
- Is it Lucille?
- No, sir, it's not your dead wife.

01:02:08.155 --> 01:02:09.952
It's your nephew Rick.

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:12.185
Remember, no bad news.

01:02:12.225 --> 01:02:15.092
Now, sir, here you go.
This is my bill.

01:02:15.128 --> 01:02:18.620
- You did surgery on me?
- Yes, sir, we confused you

01:02:18.665 --> 01:02:20.530
with one of our
sex-change patients,

01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:22.865
but don't worry,
we didn't remove your penis.

01:02:22.903 --> 01:02:25.838
We did cut your testicles off, but, well,
since your wife's dead,

01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:27.464
you won't be
needing them anyway.

01:02:27.507 --> 01:02:29.304
You just want
to keep his spirits up.

01:02:29.343 --> 01:02:31.470
He'll land on his feet
in no time.

01:02:33.046 --> 01:02:36.209
We are gathered today to say goodbye

01:02:36.249 --> 01:02:39.116
- to Lucille Adams.
- Goodbye!

01:02:39.152 --> 01:02:41.814
And now the eulogy.

01:02:41.855 --> 01:02:44.221
It's tragic to think this is the last time

01:02:44.257 --> 01:02:46.725
that I can look
upon my wife's face.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.990
God, Lucille!

01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:53.329
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!

01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:55.301
Ahhh!

01:02:55.335 --> 01:02:57.701
Lucille!
Snookie lumps!

01:02:57.738 --> 01:02:59.706
I'm sorry, there's been
a terrible mistake.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.607
- This is your wife.
- Ah!

01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:04.803
She is this man's wife.

01:03:07.147 --> 01:03:10.048
Give me five minutes.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.785
- Uncle Albert!
- I'm not finished.

01:03:20.527 --> 01:03:22.757
You're one lucky guy.
Now...

01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:24.286
where's Lucille?

01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:27.425
Ah, Lucille!

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:36.842
I do have this coupon
for a cremation.

01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:42.839
Rick?

01:03:44.184 --> 01:03:46.675
I am so sorry
for your loss.

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:50.947
What is it?

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:53.118
I know I said some things,

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.151
but now more than ever,
I realize...

01:03:56.563 --> 01:03:58.497
we can never be together.

01:03:58.532 --> 01:04:01.262
I don't believe you.

01:04:03.036 --> 01:04:06.437
You love me, Rick.
I know you do.

01:04:06.473 --> 01:04:09.874
Jill, trust me.
I'm telling you this for your own good.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.611
I don't love you.

01:04:17.651 --> 01:04:19.642
You're no longer
in my five.

01:04:21.221 --> 01:04:23.189
How could you?

01:04:29.262 --> 01:04:30.991
# When I was young #

01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:35.666
# I never needed anyone #

01:04:38.104 --> 01:04:41.835
# Makin' love
was just for fun #

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.308
# Those days are gone #

01:04:53.386 --> 01:04:59.484
# All by myself #

01:04:59.526 --> 01:05:02.154
# Don't wanna be #

01:05:02.195 --> 01:05:07.064
# All by myself #

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.931
# Anymore #

01:05:10.103 --> 01:05:15.405
# All by myself #

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:18.300
# Don't wanna be #

01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:23.078
# All by myself. #

01:05:23.116 --> 01:05:26.608
# Anymore #

01:05:26.653 --> 01:05:32.353
# All by myself #

01:05:32.392 --> 01:05:34.519
# Don't want to be #

01:05:34.561 --> 01:05:39.021
# All by myself #

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:42.364
# Anymore #

01:05:42.402 --> 01:05:46.862
# All by myself. #

01:05:52.579 --> 01:05:54.410
You can't keep
getting lucky, man.

01:05:54.447 --> 01:05:56.677
You only beat me
by two strokes this time.

01:05:56.716 --> 01:05:59.116
And the back nine
is what killed.

01:05:59.152 --> 01:06:00.949
Oh my God!

01:06:00.987 --> 01:06:03.785
- Look at this place.
- Yo, what are you doing, man?

01:06:03.823 --> 01:06:05.984
You gotta pull
yourself together, dude.

01:06:06.026 --> 01:06:09.393
What's the point?

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.625
Look at you...
eating junk food,

01:06:15.669 --> 01:06:19.264
wearing fake beards,

01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:22.434
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside.

01:06:22.475 --> 01:06:24.966
Yeah, well, I'm not
the Dragonfly anymore.

01:06:25.011 --> 01:06:27.844
But you said the Hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people.

01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:31.078
I told you I'm no hero.
All right? Aunt Lucille's dead,

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:32.948
I've rejected the only girl
I've ever loved

01:06:32.986 --> 01:06:35.284
and I can't even fly.

01:06:36.756 --> 01:06:40.089
I wish I'd never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly.

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:43.323
And maybe your father
shouldn't have given you this after all.

01:06:43.363 --> 01:06:46.992
Look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring.

01:06:47.033 --> 01:06:50.230
"Honor, valor, sacrifice,

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:52.670
duty, commitment,
bravery, justice,

01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:54.503
integrity, brotherhood,

01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:57.669
self-esteem, low prices,
affordable housing,

01:06:57.711 --> 01:07:00.373
loose-fitting pants,
cheap internet porn."

01:07:01.381 --> 01:07:03.372
The rest is in Latin.

01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:05.680
Rick, the hero's path
is dangerous.

01:07:05.719 --> 01:07:09.416
You may fail or you may fly.
All that matters

01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:12.619
is that you do it
for the best of reasons.

01:07:12.659 --> 01:07:14.650
Helping others, Rick,

01:07:14.694 --> 01:07:17.060
that's what makes you
a real hero.

01:07:18.732 --> 01:07:20.563
Maybe you're right,

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.034
but even if I wanted to stop
the Hourglass,

01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:24.934
I wouldn't know
where to start.

01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:27.735
I mean, where's he gonna
find thousands of people in one place?

01:07:27.774 --> 01:07:30.265
Look.

01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:33.143
Reporting here live from the
Empire City convention center

01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:35.613
where thousands of people
are in one place,

01:07:35.649 --> 01:07:37.742
but none of them
more important

01:07:37.784 --> 01:07:40.184
than the attendees
of the World Humanity Awards.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.654
I'll drive.

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:49.255
Well, that shortcut through the playground
sure saved us some time.

01:07:49.295 --> 01:07:51.456
You go ahead,

01:07:51.498 --> 01:07:53.762
I'll find
a place to park.

01:07:55.802 --> 01:07:58.134
Mister, please stop!

01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:00.639
Each year
the World Humanity Awards

01:08:00.674 --> 01:08:02.938
are held to honor
the greatest achievements

01:08:02.976 --> 01:08:05.240
on behalf of all humanity.

01:08:05.278 --> 01:08:07.303
This gala event
is expected to draw

01:08:07.347 --> 01:08:10.043
the world's most prestigious
leaders to Empire City.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:12.313
- Excuse us, excuse us!
- "Empire City Times."

01:08:12.352 --> 01:08:15.583
Damn! Look,
there go Prince Charles.

01:08:15.622 --> 01:08:17.647
And Nelson Mandela.
Nelson!

01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:19.522
Hey, I was
in jail too, man.

01:08:21.394 --> 01:08:23.919
One of the guests here
is the Hourglass.

01:08:23.962 --> 01:08:25.828
But which one?

01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:29.731
Thank you so much
for inviting us, Mr. Landers.

01:08:29.769 --> 01:08:31.964
Well, when you're being
honored by the world,

01:08:32.005 --> 01:08:33.563
you want
your family with you.

01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:38.676
Perhaps one day, you could
be part of our family too.

01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:42.743
Ladies and gentlemen,
our first award

01:08:42.782 --> 01:08:45.546
is for the medical
breakthrough of the year.

01:08:45.585 --> 01:08:47.779
For his company's
pioneering work

01:08:47.821 --> 01:08:50.288
in the field
of feminine hygiene

01:08:50.323 --> 01:08:53.189
I award Lou Landers
douchebag of the year.

01:08:54.894 --> 01:08:57.453
# Douchebag #

01:08:57.497 --> 01:09:00.466
# He's the douchebag
of the year #

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.060
# Now ain't
he great, folks? #

01:09:03.103 --> 01:09:06.231
# Ain't he grand?
The douchebag of the year. #

01:09:11.877 --> 01:09:14.870
# Douchebag #

01:09:14.913 --> 01:09:18.350
# He's Mr. Douchebag
of the year #

01:09:18.384 --> 01:09:20.978
# Look at him smile,
look at him shine #

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.649
# He's the douchebag of,
the douchebag of the year. #

01:09:24.691 --> 01:09:28.252
Hold up the douchebag!
Hold up the douchebag, sir.

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:33.127
Stop right there, Landers.

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:35.600
Mr. Riker.
So...

01:09:35.635 --> 01:09:37.102
you know.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:39.298
You're damn right I do.

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:43.005
Someone in this auditorium
is the Hourglass.

01:09:43.042 --> 01:09:46.102
I need your help
to figure out who it is.

01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:48.273
Now the Hourglass
could be anyone...

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:50.339
a guest of honor...

01:09:50.383 --> 01:09:52.283
maybe even
a stagehand.

01:09:57.724 --> 01:10:00.818
This may be nothing,
but I did see a man

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.522
with what looked like
a canister of

01:10:03.563 --> 01:10:04.894
cerillium.

01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:06.523
Who?

01:10:06.566 --> 01:10:09.034
- This year's lifetime achievement award...
- Him.

01:10:09.068 --> 01:10:11.798
...goes to one of the world's
greatest souls,

01:10:11.838 --> 01:10:14.636
His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:24.148
This man isn't who you think
he is, he's the Hourglass.

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:26.311
No no,
I'm a man of peace.

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:29.150
Shut up! You're plotting
to kill all these people

01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:31.020
and I can prove it.
Show the world

01:10:31.057 --> 01:10:33.787
the armor you're hiding
under these robes.

01:10:34.961 --> 01:10:36.485
You can't fool me,
Hourglass.

01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:39.157
You're packing 10 lbs
of Cerillium under there.

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:40.257
- What?
- Ahh!

01:10:43.937 --> 01:10:45.666
Take him down.

01:10:49.943 --> 01:10:52.036
Tutu.

01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:58.082
Peace!

01:10:58.117 --> 01:10:59.482
Pea...

01:11:09.329 --> 01:11:11.627
Shit shit shit shit shit.

01:11:15.835 --> 01:11:18.201
You!

01:11:18.238 --> 01:11:19.967
You're the Hourglass.

01:11:22.242 --> 01:11:24.676
It's a pity you saw that,
my dear.

01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:29.512
Perhaps this will help
you forget.

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:37.116
What are you doing?

01:11:39.359 --> 01:11:41.520
Take me.

01:11:59.712 --> 01:12:01.509
Hourglass!

01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:11.554
- Hero con?
- It's a convention for people

01:12:11.591 --> 01:12:14.424
who like to dress up
as their favorite heroes and villains.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.088
- By the way, your costume sucks.
- Out of my way!

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:21.400
Excuse me,
there is a line.

01:12:22.835 --> 01:12:25.030
No, you're killing him
all wrong.

01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:28.040
It's like this.

01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:30.941
Better.

01:12:32.545 --> 01:12:33.637
Oh, shit.

01:12:49.429 --> 01:12:51.920
Hourglass, you'll never
get away with this!

01:12:51.965 --> 01:12:55.401
Forget it, Dragonfly.
You're too late.

01:12:57.337 --> 01:12:59.305
Run!

01:13:02.608 --> 01:13:03.939
Yeah.

01:13:14.787 --> 01:13:16.914
Goodbye...

01:13:18.391 --> 01:13:19.415
little fly.

01:13:21.995 --> 01:13:23.963
Dragonfly!

01:13:24.998 --> 01:13:27.466
- No!
- Ahhh!

01:13:46.252 --> 01:13:48.447
My eye!

01:13:50.023 --> 01:13:53.618
So, are you gonna
keep the body, or...

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:03.233
Eh.

01:14:03.269 --> 01:14:07.603
Dragonfly, you must
stop the Hourglass.

01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.343
I can't.

01:14:11.377 --> 01:14:13.345
I can't fly.

01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:16.075
If there is one lesson
my life can teach,

01:14:16.115 --> 01:14:19.607
it is that the spirit
is stronger than the body.

01:14:19.652 --> 01:14:21.882
The hero comes from within.

01:14:21.921 --> 01:14:24.014
Those are
Celine Dion lyrics.

01:14:24.057 --> 01:14:27.083
Whatever.
It's still true.

01:14:28.327 --> 01:14:29.658
You're right.

01:14:36.836 --> 01:14:38.827
It's working.

01:14:40.473 --> 01:14:42.373
Sorry.

01:14:43.376 --> 01:14:44.866
Watch, Dragonfly,

01:14:44.911 --> 01:14:47.141
as your city dies.

01:14:58.991 --> 01:15:01.186
Where... am I?

01:15:01.227 --> 01:15:03.457
You're with me,

01:15:03.496 --> 01:15:05.930
your lover.

01:15:11.537 --> 01:15:12.970
Dragonfly!

01:15:15.108 --> 01:15:16.598
No.

01:15:18.778 --> 01:15:22.475
- No.
- Only now do you understand.

01:15:23.749 --> 01:15:26.616
Oh, come...

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.353
Aha!

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:32.590
I need you to jerk this off.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.193
Yeah.

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.696
There's not enough time.

01:15:40.433 --> 01:15:42.128
Oh fuck.

01:15:49.175 --> 01:15:52.303
- It's over.
- Dragonfly!

01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:54.336
Jill!

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:58.547
Gotcha.

01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:02.516
- Rick?
- You didn't think I'd let anything happen

01:16:02.555 --> 01:16:04.455
to the girl I love, did you?

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:06.185
Well, we're still
falling.

01:16:06.225 --> 01:16:09.422
Damn it!
If only I could fly.

01:16:09.462 --> 01:16:11.487
Maybe I wasn't cut out
to be a hero.

01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:14.523
You know, maybe I was meant
to have a normal job... an accountant,

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:15.864
a gym teacher.

01:16:15.902 --> 01:16:18.837
- This is a really tall building.
- Rick!

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:20.839
I don't care
what happens anymore.

01:16:20.873 --> 01:16:22.773
If I die, I die happily
in your arms.

01:16:22.808 --> 01:16:26.073
You're my hero, Rick Riker,
and I love you.

01:16:31.551 --> 01:16:34.452
Yes!
Oh, thank God!

01:16:34.487 --> 01:16:36.387
We only have
50 stories left.

01:16:36.422 --> 01:16:38.219
Hang on.

01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:51.529
Thank you, Dragonfly.

01:16:51.571 --> 01:16:54.369
Because of you, our city
is safe at last.

01:16:54.407 --> 01:16:57.638
- You said it, Dr. Hawking.
- Shit!

01:16:57.677 --> 01:16:59.838
It's a happy ending
for us all.

01:16:59.879 --> 01:17:02.541
Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:06.214
Who am I?
I'm Rick Riker.

01:17:06.252 --> 01:17:10.348
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:13.358
I will forever be
a superhero...

01:17:18.464 --> 01:17:20.557
I am the Hourglass!

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.559
# Darkness has found you,
evil surrounds you #

01:17:24.604 --> 01:17:28.904
# No one to save you,
we're almost out of time #

01:17:28.941 --> 01:17:31.933
# What do you do when
nothing can be done? #

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:36.438
# Where do you go
with nowhere left to run? #

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:41.977
# Where is the one
who stands up and tells you #

01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:46.355
# I'm here to save you?
We're almost out of time #

01:17:46.392 --> 01:17:49.452
# Nobody knows just who
he's trying to be #

01:17:50.963 --> 01:17:53.796
# Behind this mask, his wings
and suit of green #

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:58.728
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

01:17:58.771 --> 01:18:03.970
# And fly away #

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:07.309
# Don't worry you're safe #

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:12.580
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:15.917
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

01:18:17.256 --> 01:18:20.089
# Jill and I were always
meant to be #

01:18:20.126 --> 01:18:25.325
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:27.992
# Don't they know that
I'll protect you? #

01:18:28.034 --> 01:18:30.264
# Don't they know
they'll have to get through #

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:32.897
# Me #

01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:36.305
# Don't worry yourself... #

01:18:42.782 --> 01:18:44.909
Your time is up!

01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:47.510
# Watch out behind you #

01:18:47.553 --> 01:18:49.714
# This is designed to #

01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:51.950
# Quickly remind you #

01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:54.016
# We're almost out of time #

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.029
# Somebody tell me what
he's trying to be #

01:18:58.564 --> 01:19:02.261
# Behind his mask, his wings,
his suit of green #

01:19:02.301 --> 01:19:06.260
# Just in time to reach up
for the sky #

01:19:06.305 --> 01:19:11.174
# And fly away #

01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:14.871
# Don't worry you're safe #

01:19:16.449 --> 01:19:20.146
# In my arms,
'cause it takes your love #

01:19:20.186 --> 01:19:23.917
# To lift me up,
it's safe to say #

01:19:23.956 --> 01:19:27.722
# Jill and I were
always meant to be #

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.720
# So I will show you why
I'm here to stay #

01:19:32.765 --> 01:19:35.359
# Don't you worry,
I'm the one #

01:19:35.401 --> 01:19:37.869
# Who let's them know
that I'll protect you #

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:41.669
# Don't they know they'll
have to get through me? #

01:19:42.842 --> 01:19:45.470
# Don't worry you're safe... #

01:19:46.679 --> 01:19:49.910
# In my arms so green #

01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:54.648
# It's easy. #

01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:57.884
#I need a hero #

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.688
#I need a hero #

01:20:06.766 --> 01:20:09.496
# I'm calling out,
I want you here #

01:20:09.535 --> 01:20:12.129
# This is my 011 #

01:20:12.171 --> 01:20:15.572
# I'm sinking down
into the fear #

01:20:15.608 --> 01:20:17.667
# That I just can't outrun #

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:20.873
# To save myself
all I can see #

01:20:20.913 --> 01:20:23.609
# Is that I've got
no choice #

01:20:23.649 --> 01:20:26.584
# I cry for help
and pray you'll be #

01:20:26.619 --> 01:20:29.315
# The one who hears
my voice #

01:20:29.355 --> 01:20:31.152
# I need a hero #

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:34.921
# Someone to rescue me
when I'm in a mess #

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:39.659
# Whenever I'm falling,
someone to be my safety net #

01:20:39.698 --> 01:20:42.963
# I need a hero
watching over me #

01:20:43.002 --> 01:20:45.869
# I need a hero
in my time of need #

01:20:45.905 --> 01:20:48.271
# To fix it when
it's going wrong #

01:20:48.307 --> 01:20:51.902
# To be big and strong,
you know that I need a hero #

01:20:51.944 --> 01:20:55.107
# Waited my whole life #

01:20:55.147 --> 01:20:58.344
# For someone like you #

01:20:58.384 --> 01:21:00.944
# And I think it's time #

01:21:00.986 --> 01:21:03.716
# For my dreams
to come true #

01:21:03.756 --> 01:21:07.522
# If only you could hear me #

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.051
# I know you'd
be near me #

01:21:10.095 --> 01:21:13.792
# You'll never let me go #

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:16.859
#Oh, I need a hero #

01:21:20.773 --> 01:21:22.240
