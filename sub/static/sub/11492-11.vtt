WEBVTT

00:03.509 --> 00:06.429
All right,
I have turned "it" into "ziti",

00:07.074 --> 00:10.548
with a triple letter on Z
and a double word on the I.

00:10.673 --> 00:12.934
Plus, going down, I've created "za".

00:15.472 --> 00:16.475
Za?

00:16.560 --> 00:18.365
A colloquialism for pizza.

00:19.417 --> 00:22.973
One of five two-letter words accepted
by the National Scrabble Association.

00:24.794 --> 00:25.797
Unbelievable.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.699
You can call them if you want.

00:29.853 --> 00:32.922
That's what we in Scrabble circles
call a two tile takedown.

00:36.094 --> 00:37.611
Alan, is our limo here yet?

00:37.737 --> 00:39.267
Sorry, I haven't seen a limo.

00:39.392 --> 00:40.645
Oh, 100 points!

00:43.772 --> 00:45.389
That's a gorgeous dress, Courtney.

00:45.558 --> 00:48.462
Thanks. Charlie insisted
on buying it for me to wear tonight.

00:48.588 --> 00:51.463
- What's the charity again?
- I don't know. Landmines, orphans.

00:51.589 --> 00:53.193
Landmines for orphans.

00:53.545 --> 00:55.408
I just want to show you off.

00:56.107 --> 00:58.186
- Well, you look great.
- Thank you.

00:59.237 --> 01:00.440
No, there's...

01:01.232 --> 01:02.535
Something wrong.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.081
What?

01:04.289 --> 01:06.194
I don't know. Something's...

01:06.319 --> 01:07.473
Something's missing.

01:07.925 --> 01:08.927
I got it.

01:14.212 --> 01:15.666
You shouldn't have.

01:16.755 --> 01:19.542
Well, you've done a lot of things for me
you shouldn't have.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.613
Now you look great.

01:23.823 --> 01:25.335
God, it is beautiful.

01:26.138 --> 01:27.141
Thank you.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:40.262 --> 01:42.100
What are you up to tonight?

01:42.226 --> 01:44.934
Not much.
Just a quiet, romantic evening at home.

01:45.059 --> 01:46.062
Loser.

01:48.392 --> 01:49.625
Come on, that's not fair.

01:50.438 --> 01:52.385
No, it's my word! Loser.

01:54.391 --> 01:55.696
I should point out

01:55.821 --> 01:58.742
you could have used the C at the top
of the board and made "closer".

02:00.865 --> 02:02.469
I'll stick with loser.

02:06.579 --> 02:08.383
Great. We'll be right out.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.578
- Our chariot awaits.
- Have fun.

02:10.746 --> 02:12.100
Thanks. You, too.

02:12.442 --> 02:13.501
Do me a favor.

02:13.627 --> 02:16.493
When we get in the limo,
ask the driver to put up the partition.

02:16.619 --> 02:17.622
You bet.

02:18.132 --> 02:19.332
Isn't that sweet?

02:19.457 --> 02:21.590
She's gonna do more things
she shouldn't.

02:28.681 --> 02:30.185
Gluten-free pretzel?

02:31.055 --> 02:32.199
No, thanks.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.377
I guess this isn't much
of a Saturday night date.

02:36.042 --> 02:38.523
Alan, it's fine.
I like staying in with you.

02:38.970 --> 02:41.527
I could probably do
without the Bom-bom!

02:44.011 --> 02:47.170
I wish I could take you out
and get you things like Charlie does.

02:47.605 --> 02:49.094
I don't need those things.

02:50.142 --> 02:51.696
I mean, they're nice.

02:52.545 --> 02:55.492
They're more than nice.
They're what every girl dreams of.

02:55.617 --> 02:56.861
But let's face it.

02:56.986 --> 02:58.880
Some dreams just have to die.

03:01.259 --> 03:03.229
Well, I'm sorry you had to settle.

03:04.261 --> 03:05.614
I'm not settling.

03:06.405 --> 03:07.452
I'm accepting.

03:07.578 --> 03:10.274
So you're not rich
and successful like Charlie.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.042
So you can't take me out in limos
and shower me in diamonds.

03:13.168 --> 03:15.776
So there's no expensive restaurants
or beautiful dresses.

03:22.133 --> 03:23.135
But?

03:23.871 --> 03:24.874
What?

03:25.545 --> 03:27.408
Well, you know,
I can't take you out,

03:27.533 --> 03:30.518
and I can't give you stuff, but...

03:31.400 --> 03:33.758
But... I love you?

03:35.582 --> 03:36.584
Why?

03:39.101 --> 03:41.657
Boy, you're just gonna keep
pushing this, aren't you?

03:41.782 --> 03:43.346
You love me. I'm good.

03:43.472 --> 03:44.976
Let's play Scrabble.

03:45.862 --> 03:46.865
Axolotl!

04:03.810 --> 04:04.813
Morning.

04:04.838 --> 04:05.841
Morning.

04:08.299 --> 04:09.453
Pottery Barn?

04:10.532 --> 04:13.279
I'm looking for ideas
for a birthday present for Lyndsey.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.290
At the Pottery Barn?

04:16.031 --> 04:18.038
Well, I don't have your money.

04:18.163 --> 04:21.642
And you can communicate your feelings
for a woman without diamonds.

04:21.853 --> 04:24.110
True,
but diamonds get you limo skull.

04:26.487 --> 04:29.170
Pottery Barn won't get you dry humped
in the back of a city bus.

04:30.463 --> 04:31.466
Charming.

04:31.736 --> 04:34.231
So, how was the charity soirÃ©e
last night?

04:34.411 --> 04:36.836
I don't know.
We never made it out of the limo.

04:37.852 --> 04:40.223
Do you have any idea
how bad you're making me look?

04:40.348 --> 04:41.424
That's not me.

04:41.593 --> 04:43.682
That's genetics
and barber school haircuts.

04:44.191 --> 04:46.982
I'm serious. How do you think I feel
when I'm with Lyndsey,

04:47.108 --> 04:49.453
and I see you shower Courtney
with limos and diamonds?

04:50.392 --> 04:52.656
I never thought about that.
I have a solution, though.

04:52.782 --> 04:54.326
- What's that?
- Move out.

04:55.456 --> 04:59.239
I'm just saying, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't do that in front of us.

04:59.543 --> 05:00.913
Again, I have a solution.

05:01.084 --> 05:04.843
Let's stipulate you want me
to move out and I'm not going anywhere.

05:05.155 --> 05:06.640
What is it you'd have me do?

05:06.765 --> 05:10.086
Not enjoy the money that I earn?
Not lavish it on the people I love?

05:10.211 --> 05:12.420
Sneak around in the night
giving gifts to my girlfriend,

05:12.546 --> 05:16.009
- so you don't get your feelings hurt?
- Is that something you'd consider?

05:17.196 --> 05:19.480
- No, but I'll tell you what I will do.
- What's that?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.343
If I should come home some night

05:21.469 --> 05:23.739
to find you on a chair
with a rope around your neck

05:23.864 --> 05:26.993
because you can't bear another moment
of your pathetic life,

05:27.118 --> 05:29.427
I give you my word,
I will kick the chair.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.904
Santa Claus bottle stopper.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.333
Only 12 dollars.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.555
I can get her two.

05:43.350 --> 05:44.353
Dad?

05:48.617 --> 05:50.772
- I need money.
- Join the club.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.982
Seriously.
My clothes are getting too small.

05:54.949 --> 05:58.963
I give your mother money every month
for the purpose of buying what you need.

05:59.448 --> 06:01.134
That's not how she sees it.

06:02.601 --> 06:05.107
I don't know what to tell you.
Things are tight right now.

06:05.275 --> 06:06.579
So are my shoes.

06:07.136 --> 06:09.992
What do you want me to do,
tap into your college fund?

06:10.117 --> 06:11.220
I guess not.

06:12.426 --> 06:13.780
Hang on a second.

06:15.927 --> 06:18.014
Let's not throw that idea out
so quickly.

06:18.404 --> 06:21.168
- What do you mean?
- Well, realistically,

06:21.293 --> 06:24.707
do you actually
see yourself going to college?

06:24.833 --> 06:27.640
Because if you don't,
we could use that money

06:27.778 --> 06:30.743
to buy you some new clothes,
plus maybe some other things.

06:31.118 --> 06:32.705
It's funny that you ask that.

06:32.830 --> 06:35.152
I had no interest in college
until a few days ago.

06:35.278 --> 06:36.280
What changed?

06:36.474 --> 06:39.316
I saw this video called
<i>Topless Coeds of the Big Ten</i>,

06:39.595 --> 06:41.658
and I decided
I need to go to college.

06:42.710 --> 06:45.523
You expect me to pay
30, 40,000 dollars a year

06:45.649 --> 06:47.889
so you can meet drunk girls
who lift their shirts?

06:48.829 --> 06:49.932
Yes, please.

06:52.658 --> 06:54.288
Is that a no on the clothes money?

06:54.927 --> 06:56.463
I'll talk to your mother about it.

06:56.754 --> 06:58.509
Now I'm filled with hope.

07:00.192 --> 07:01.495
Alan, come here.

07:03.885 --> 07:05.517
Are you gonna make me feel worse?

07:05.642 --> 07:06.918
Is that even possible?

07:07.128 --> 07:08.447
I wouldn't think so,

07:08.572 --> 07:10.427
but you usually find a way.

07:12.005 --> 07:13.083
What do you want?

07:13.208 --> 07:16.620
I overheard you trying
to talk Huckleberry out of education.

07:17.418 --> 07:19.072
Not my proudest moment.

07:19.198 --> 07:21.931
But I'm desperate to find a way
to buy Lyndsey a birthday present.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.221
All right, here's what I'm gonna do.

07:24.346 --> 07:26.824
I'm gonna lend you enough
so you can buy her something nice.

07:27.345 --> 07:29.481
- How much?
- Are you kidding?

07:29.606 --> 07:32.316
- You're negotiating with me?
- Forget it.

07:32.441 --> 07:35.314
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not gonna take your money.

07:35.578 --> 07:38.920
I'm sorry. I think
I might have just had a small stroke.

07:39.046 --> 07:40.876
You're not gonna take my money?

07:41.305 --> 07:42.727
You heard me right.

07:42.852 --> 07:45.542
I have to find a way
to buy Lyndsey a nice present on my own.

07:45.668 --> 07:48.696
- It's a matter of self-respect.
- Little late for that, isn't it?

07:48.907 --> 07:50.657
If it was for me,
I'd take your money.

07:50.782 --> 07:52.669
If it was for you,
I wouldn't offer it.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.412
But this is my girlfriend.

07:54.704 --> 07:57.060
If I can't do this one thing
for her,

07:57.185 --> 07:58.649
then maybe I don't deserve her.

07:59.417 --> 08:00.531
What's your plan?

08:00.761 --> 08:01.914
I'm not sure,

08:02.248 --> 08:04.453
but when Alan Harper sets his mind

08:04.963 --> 08:07.269
just stand back and watch it happen.

08:09.507 --> 08:11.262
Cue the theme from <i> Rocky</i>.

10:26.835 --> 10:27.949
Need some help?

10:29.635 --> 10:32.006
- A little late to ask, don't you think?
- Nope.

10:34.413 --> 10:36.068
Well, the good news is,

10:36.489 --> 10:37.491
I am done.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.772
I have accomplished my mission.

10:39.897 --> 10:43.078
After three weeks of 16-hour days
at the office and the mall,

10:43.204 --> 10:46.039
I have managed to earn enough money
to buy Lyndsey a beautiful

10:46.165 --> 10:47.418
birthday present.

10:47.543 --> 10:48.546
VoilÃ !

10:49.040 --> 10:50.795
A matching set of natural

10:51.276 --> 10:53.533
South Sea Island pearls.

10:55.081 --> 10:56.133
No kidding?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.394
And you got these at the mall?

10:58.763 --> 11:00.768
Well, in the mall parking lot.

11:01.207 --> 11:03.246
You bought pearls from a guy
in a parking lot?

11:03.414 --> 11:04.417
Not a guy.

11:04.843 --> 11:06.447
A Tahitian wholesaler.

11:07.136 --> 11:09.393
You have any idea what the mark-up
is on these things?

11:09.562 --> 11:11.651
By eliminating the middleman,
I saved a fortune.

11:12.201 --> 11:14.870
- You sure about that?
- Don't worry, they're real.

11:14.995 --> 11:17.339
I have a certificate
of authenticity.

11:20.487 --> 11:22.399
The word authentic
doesn't have a K in it.

11:23.647 --> 11:25.786
It's the man's second language,
Charlie.

11:28.256 --> 11:29.783
For future reference,

11:29.908 --> 11:33.343
the way you can tell if pearls are real
is you rub them on your teeth.

11:33.469 --> 11:36.061
If they're rough, they're real,
if they're smooth, they're fake.

11:36.186 --> 11:37.892
Fine, I will prove it to you.

11:38.187 --> 11:39.190
See?

11:41.347 --> 11:42.349
Rough.

11:43.631 --> 11:45.463
And oddly minty.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.101
Oh, darn.

12:10.911 --> 12:13.085
- Morning.
- Morning. Hey, nice pearls.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.219
Found in the garbage.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.103
Strange some of the things people
throw away.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.809
I also found what looked like

12:19.934 --> 12:22.704
a half-written suicide note
in your brother's handwriting.

12:23.038 --> 12:25.004
- No kidding?
- Should I be worried?

12:25.215 --> 12:27.364
You mean
that he won't go through with it?

12:28.680 --> 12:30.860
He'll be fine.
He's just having money problems.

12:31.070 --> 12:32.734
Okay. But fair warning...

12:32.859 --> 12:35.000
he offs himself,
I ain't cleaning it up.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.392
- Who's offing themselves?
- Nobody.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.792
Nobody important.

12:41.798 --> 12:43.908
I was wondering,
are you going anywhere today?

12:44.138 --> 12:46.584
Don't try to play me,
knucklehead, just ask.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.048
Can I borrow your car?

12:48.258 --> 12:50.399
- Come on.
- That's a very expensive car.

12:50.524 --> 12:52.653
There's no way I'm putting you
behind that wheel.

12:52.778 --> 12:54.278
See you later.
I go to shop.

12:54.489 --> 12:57.269
- Have fun.
- Are you taking Uncle Charlie's car?

12:57.492 --> 12:59.630
- Yeah. Why?
- Maybe I could drive you.

12:59.755 --> 13:01.890
Save you the hassle of parking
and everything.

13:02.186 --> 13:04.547
Aren't you the sweetest thing.
Thanks.

13:04.763 --> 13:06.155
See you, handsome!

13:07.329 --> 13:08.833
Yeah, see you, handsome.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.323
Wonderful.

13:13.358 --> 13:15.706
I just got outsmarted
by Mr. Potato Head.

13:33.403 --> 13:34.719
I did a bad thing.

13:39.883 --> 13:42.456
- A very bad thing.
- Sorry to hear it.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.543
- I don't want to tell you about it.
- Good.

13:46.848 --> 13:47.851
I am ashamed.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.591
Okay, we both know
you're gonna tell me, so just tell me.

13:50.799 --> 13:53.142
In order to explain it,
I have to go back a few years.

13:53.268 --> 13:54.772
Please, God help me.

13:55.538 --> 13:58.181
Back when Judith and I were
still married but having problems,

13:58.516 --> 14:00.776
I decided to try to make her happy
by buying her

14:00.901 --> 14:03.157
a really nice
pair or diamond earrings.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.503
- You could afford diamond earrings?
- No alimony, no child support.

14:06.785 --> 14:08.292
It was a bountiful time.

14:10.268 --> 14:13.238
Anyway, I spent a fortune on them
and I wrapped them up really nice

14:13.364 --> 14:16.707
and took her to an expensive restaurant
and gave them to her over cocktails.

14:17.641 --> 14:19.596
- And?
- She said, "Thanks,"

14:19.755 --> 14:22.258
ordered the lobster,
then filed for divorce.

14:23.032 --> 14:25.039
At which point, I moved in with you.

14:25.895 --> 14:28.584
You're right, Alan,
that was a very bad thing.

14:28.978 --> 14:32.067
- No, that was just the prologue.
- Please, God, help me.

14:32.695 --> 14:35.206
So, this afternoon,
I was over at Judith's to talk to her

14:35.332 --> 14:38.250
about using my child support payments
to buy Jake new clothes.

14:38.376 --> 14:40.001
- Yeah?
- She's against it.

14:41.466 --> 14:43.848
We argued,
she stormed out of the room

14:44.136 --> 14:46.537
and left me standing there by myself

14:46.901 --> 14:48.462
in the house I used to own.

14:49.190 --> 14:51.448
Anyway, before I left,
I figured I'd pee.

14:51.681 --> 14:54.472
I didn't really need to, but, you got
to figure with the traffic,

14:54.597 --> 14:56.813
- it's a good defensiv...
- Would you please get to it!

14:57.337 --> 14:59.161
Almost there, almost there. So,

14:59.448 --> 15:01.263
as I was walking down the hallway,

15:01.557 --> 15:04.415
I noticed that Judith's bedroom door
was open,

15:05.358 --> 15:08.983
and... I thought
about those beautiful diamond earrings

15:09.433 --> 15:11.704
just sitting there
in her jewelry box and...

15:12.078 --> 15:14.963
how I can't even afford to buy
my girlfriend a birthday present.

15:15.690 --> 15:18.476
Let me guess.
You peed in her jewelry box.

15:22.377 --> 15:24.456
Judith never even wore them,
Charlie.

15:25.276 --> 15:27.509
You stole diamonds
from your ex-wife?

15:28.734 --> 15:29.736
Yeah.

15:30.850 --> 15:31.853
Kudos!

15:36.581 --> 15:38.654
I don't even know how it happened.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.737
It was like I was in a dream,
and my hands belonged to someone else.

15:41.862 --> 15:43.723
I have that same dream all the time.

15:45.184 --> 15:47.671
Except in mine,
the hands do belong to someone else.

15:48.498 --> 15:51.431
I'm a good man, Charlie;
I play by the rules. This isn't me.

15:51.703 --> 15:52.800
Sure it is.

15:52.926 --> 15:55.956
You made up your mind that you get
Lyndsey a nice birthday present.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.900
The only part that isn't you
is that you succeeded.

15:59.602 --> 16:01.974
I can't give these to Lyndsey...
they're tainted.

16:02.477 --> 16:04.771
I have to sneak them back
into Judith's jewelry box.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.049
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

16:07.282 --> 16:08.546
Don't you watch TV?

16:08.777 --> 16:11.612
Every time the crooks try to put
the stolen loot back, it always goes

16:11.737 --> 16:13.344
horribly, and hilariously, wrong.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.743
I will just have
to take that chance.

16:15.868 --> 16:18.614
Tomorrow I am going back to Judith's.
I'm gonna make this right.

16:19.331 --> 16:20.534
Suit yourself.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.526
I don't suppose you want
to come with me?

16:25.651 --> 16:28.190
Maybe distract her
while I put the earrings back?

16:28.587 --> 16:31.431
Yeah, that sounds like a great plan.
What could go wrong?

16:33.775 --> 16:36.513
- Okay, I'll do it myself.
- Don't call me for bail money.

16:36.725 --> 16:39.146
Why not? You were gonna give me
money to buy a present.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.490
You're not even planning
to get away with it?

16:41.615 --> 16:42.869
Of course I am.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.424
I was always planning
to become an astronaut and a cowboy.

16:54.352 --> 16:55.355
Hey, baby.

16:55.929 --> 16:58.092
- How was shopping?
- We had a great time.

16:58.261 --> 16:59.815
Yeah, it was a blast.

17:02.638 --> 17:05.025
Look... I got the same watch
Johnny Depp has.

17:06.118 --> 17:09.198
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
You bought him all this?

17:09.324 --> 17:11.970
- He was so helpful.
- Here you go, handsome.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.049
By they way,
you got a parking ticket.

17:20.551 --> 17:23.685
Damn it, I don't want you buying stuff
for that clown on my credit card.

17:24.057 --> 17:25.609
Why not? You buy me stuff.

17:25.998 --> 17:27.777
- There's a difference.
- What's that?

17:28.119 --> 17:31.967
Well, you're having sex with me,
and he's... he's just screwing me.

17:41.258 --> 17:42.473
You okay, honey?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.931
Yeah. I'm just a little tired.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.840
Of course you are.
You've been working so hard.

17:49.146 --> 17:51.931
- I got a little something for you.
- Lyndsey, not tonight...

17:52.056 --> 17:53.964
I'm dead from the waist down.

17:54.104 --> 17:55.642
Silly! Not that.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.470
This.

17:57.894 --> 17:59.644
- What is it?
- Open it and see.

18:03.034 --> 18:05.507
"A day of pampering
at the Beverly Glen Spa"?

18:05.943 --> 18:09.229
You can get a massage, scalp treatment,
facial, mani-pedi, anything you want.

18:09.591 --> 18:12.408
- What's the occasion?
- You're my man... you deserve it.

18:17.302 --> 18:18.305
Oh, boy.

18:18.763 --> 18:20.145
What's the matter?

18:21.165 --> 18:22.570
Your birthday's on Saturday.

18:23.001 --> 18:26.919
Alan... I told you, I don't expect
anything fancy or expensive.

18:27.521 --> 18:28.792
I know you don't.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.990
Which is why I got you these!

18:38.940 --> 18:41.400
- You shouldn't have!
- Tell me about it.

18:42.112 --> 18:43.731
They must have cost a fortune!

18:44.460 --> 18:46.106
Not really. I stole 'em.

18:53.595 --> 18:54.856
To my birthday girl.

18:55.150 --> 18:57.281
Thank you, sweetie.
How do they look?

18:57.693 --> 19:00.292
Almost as beautiful
as the woman who's wearing them.

19:06.985 --> 19:09.326
What a surprise.
What brings you here?

19:09.683 --> 19:12.033
It's our...
weekly in-lieu-of-sex dinner.

19:16.548 --> 19:19.279
- Hi, Lyndsey. How have you been?
- Good, thanks.

19:19.405 --> 19:20.504
How about you?

19:21.537 --> 19:22.540
Fine.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.388
- Alan, what is wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm just...

19:26.681 --> 19:30.084
here with my girlfriend having...
a little birthday celebration.

19:30.692 --> 19:32.629
- What are you doing?!
- I'm sorry,

19:32.754 --> 19:35.212
I love it when your hair
is down... it's so sexy.

19:36.912 --> 19:38.315
He's right, it is.

19:39.713 --> 19:42.272
- Would you like to join us for a drink?
- Great idea!

19:44.188 --> 19:46.043
So, Lyndsey, happy birthday.

19:46.307 --> 19:48.666
- Thank you.
- Did you get anything special?

19:48.791 --> 19:50.267
Well, as a matter of fact...

19:50.437 --> 19:52.712
All right, I just have
to say something here!

19:53.448 --> 19:57.108
You whine and moan
about not having enough money to buy

19:57.362 --> 19:59.544
decent clothes for our son,
and yet...

19:59.670 --> 20:02.008
somehow there's enough for you
go out and have a...

20:02.133 --> 20:03.587
a big fancy dinner!

20:04.427 --> 20:05.430
What?

20:05.817 --> 20:07.606
Are you suddenly hard of hearing?

20:07.731 --> 20:10.341
Or are you just...
allergic to the truth?!

20:10.974 --> 20:12.653
- Hey, hold on...
- No, no!

20:12.779 --> 20:15.695
This needs to be said!
You should be ashamed of yourself!

20:16.650 --> 20:18.598
Shame! Shame, shame...

20:21.691 --> 20:22.693
Shame.

20:24.491 --> 20:26.015
Come on, Herb.
He's crazy.

20:27.956 --> 20:30.248
Happy birthday, Lyndsey.
I love the earrings.

20:30.510 --> 20:31.513
Coming.

20:36.898 --> 20:38.947
Can you believe I was married
to that bitch?

20:48.785 --> 20:50.710
- Where have you been?
- I was...

20:50.862 --> 20:52.664
dropping Jake off at his mother's.

20:52.965 --> 20:55.550
- How are you handling your guilt?
- You mean about the earrings?

20:57.068 --> 20:58.772
Well, interesting thing.

20:59.794 --> 21:01.702
It's much easier the second time.
