11:25.963 --> 11:30.634
(Caroline) Okay, 26 letters.
Which one could represent light?

11:30.635 --> 11:32.402
(Han) Light starts with "L"!

11:32.403 --> 11:37.007
(Sophie) Oh, wow, he's good!

11:37.008 --> 11:40.577
(Caroline) Too easy. It's Einstein
so the answer must be scientific.

11:40.578 --> 11:44.347
Wait, in Einstein's
famous formula E=mc2,

11:44.348 --> 11:47.417
the speed of light is
represented by the letter "C."

11:47.418 --> 11:50.587
A...B... C.

11:50.588 --> 11:53.289
[gasping]

11:53.290 --> 11:55.792
Oh, it's <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> themed!

11:55.793 --> 11:56.860
I'll be great at this.

11:56.861 --> 11:59.062
It was always my favorite story.

11:59.063 --> 12:02.732
Sophie and I only watch
the hard-core porno version.

12:02.733 --> 12:06.002
Yeah, it was called
<i>Alice in Underpants.</i>

12:06.003 --> 12:08.905
And our dentist was in it!

12:08.906 --> 12:10.006
[in British accent] That's enough

12:10.007 --> 12:11.407
of all your chatter!

12:11.408 --> 12:15.011
It's time to listen to the Mad Hatter.

12:15.012 --> 12:18.915
I think it's the same guy as before.

12:18.916 --> 12:22.285
Oh... Wow.

12:22.286 --> 12:24.686
He's a genius!

12:27.123 --> 12:29.792
You filled this room with illumination,

12:29.793 --> 12:34.063
but you are not done
with this situation.

12:34.064 --> 12:38.501
What rhymes with "kick in the crotch"?

12:38.502 --> 12:40.469
To proceed and be done with me,

12:40.470 --> 12:43.739
you must answer these riddles three.

12:43.740 --> 12:47.276
Y'all know I'm 80, right?

12:47.277 --> 12:49.845
One: Take it out of the package.

12:49.846 --> 12:51.280
It goes in your mouth.

12:51.281 --> 12:55.217
Chew it too long, and it will go south.

12:55.218 --> 12:57.853
It's what Earl's doing right now.

12:57.854 --> 13:00.022
Oh, Lord, am I peeing?

13:00.023 --> 13:02.324
No, he's chewing gum.

13:02.325 --> 13:04.627
"Take it out of the package.
It goes in your mouth.

13:04.628 --> 13:07.162
Chew it too long and
it'll go south." Gum.

13:07.163 --> 13:08.664
Exactamente.

13:08.665 --> 13:10.165
That wasn't too hard.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.468
Put your answer onto this card.

13:12.469 --> 13:13.836
Well done!

13:13.837 --> 13:17.373
This Groupon has already
paid for itself.

13:17.374 --> 13:20.676
Two: Arnold Schwarzenegger's is big;

13:20.677 --> 13:22.811
Michael J. Fox's is small;

13:22.812 --> 13:25.681
the Pope has one but doesn't use it;

13:25.682 --> 13:28.550
Madonna doesn't have one at all.

13:28.551 --> 13:33.222
Dongs. The answer is dongs.

13:33.223 --> 13:36.358
C'mon, Oleg, I mean
nobody can say for sure

13:36.359 --> 13:39.895
that Madonna doesn't have one.

13:39.896 --> 13:42.764
Dongs aren't the answer to everything.

13:42.765 --> 13:44.700
I used to think that.

13:44.701 --> 13:46.335
You know where that got me?

13:46.336 --> 13:50.672
Pennsylvania, with no car.

13:50.673 --> 13:54.042
Schwarzenegger's is
big, Fox's is small.

13:54.043 --> 13:57.012
It's last names.
The Pope doesn't use his.

13:57.013 --> 13:59.347
Madonna doesn't have one at all.
That's it!

13:59.348 --> 14:02.417
Correctamundo. [chuckles]

14:02.418 --> 14:03.785
With your brain power,

14:03.786 --> 14:06.721
you'll be out of here in under an hour.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.290
Well, thanks, but if I was that smart,

14:08.291 --> 14:09.624
I wouldn't have spent
the last four years

14:09.625 --> 14:13.094
getting ripped off by my roommate.

14:13.095 --> 14:16.731
Oh, come on, are you
still on the money?

14:16.732 --> 14:18.800
Oh, my God, my sister
lost both her thumbs

14:18.801 --> 14:20.235
in a combine accident

14:20.236 --> 14:24.139
and she didn't talk about it this much.

14:24.140 --> 14:26.074
Ah, here's $25.

14:26.075 --> 14:27.475
Let's call it hush money,

14:27.476 --> 14:29.911
so hush.

14:29.912 --> 14:35.250
First of all, this is $12,

14:35.251 --> 14:36.684
and fine,

14:36.685 --> 14:38.653
you won't hear a peep
out of me anymore.

14:38.654 --> 14:41.789
Fine, I don't care if we never get out.

14:41.790 --> 14:45.192
[monkey screeching]

14:47.428 --> 14:50.098
All right, FYI,

14:50.099 --> 14:55.737
yeah, Oleg and I are gonna get
really Amsterdam-y up in here.

14:55.738 --> 14:58.872
All right, we gotta get the hell out.

15:03.590 --> 15:06.493
Come on, Caroline.
Where's your sense of whimsy?

15:06.494 --> 15:08.262
And don't say Max stole it,

15:08.263 --> 15:10.964
because that's getting
older than Randy's accent.

15:10.965 --> 15:15.636
Sorry, Randy, I knew you
were a safe person to slam.

15:15.637 --> 15:18.639
Time moves forward. It doesn't go back.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.876
You've got 15 minutes.
It's 45 that you lack.

15:22.877 --> 15:24.444
[scoffs] Come on, guys.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.213
We don't need Caroline
to solve these puzzles.

15:26.214 --> 15:27.848
This is the same team that was able

15:27.849 --> 15:29.316
to figure out the Wi-Fi password

15:29.317 --> 15:32.986
to the women's shelter
next to the diner.

15:32.987 --> 15:34.921
Who said this?

15:34.922 --> 15:36.289
"If it was so, it might be;

15:36.290 --> 15:38.925
and if it were so, it would be."

15:38.926 --> 15:41.962
The fat twins?

15:41.963 --> 15:43.296
'Cause that made no sense

15:43.297 --> 15:46.733
and they look like
they get stoned a lot.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.202
[monkey screeching]

15:49.203 --> 15:52.239
Okay, Oleg, drop your pants.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.475
The monkey wants his banana.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.143
Caroline,

15:57.144 --> 15:59.546
if I have to see Oleg so much
as honk one of her boobs,

15:59.547 --> 16:01.281
I'm gonna lose it.

16:01.282 --> 16:03.917
I would help you, and
be your heaven-sent,

16:03.918 --> 16:08.755
but you screwed me on the rent.

16:08.756 --> 16:11.923
What is it gonna take to
make you get over this?

16:13.560 --> 16:15.695
You haven't even apologized.

16:15.696 --> 16:18.698
Okay. I am sorry.

16:18.699 --> 16:21.134
Are we good?

16:21.135 --> 16:23.002
You know what? No, we not good.

16:23.003 --> 16:25.471
(all) Aw, come on!

16:25.472 --> 16:28.808
Fine, I'm the only one here
who knows this story,

16:28.809 --> 16:30.810
and I'm the only one who knows
how to get out of here.

16:30.811 --> 16:34.814
There, the rabbit hole,
Alice went down and so will I.

16:34.815 --> 16:36.182
That's it.

16:36.183 --> 16:39.852
This is a bigger bust
than Max's future.

16:39.853 --> 16:42.355
Just like Alice,
I'm sick of being stuck

16:42.356 --> 16:43.923
in this upside-down world

16:43.924 --> 16:46.192
when your best friend
lies about the rent.

16:46.193 --> 16:47.627
- No, you can't!
- Oh, yes, I can.

16:47.628 --> 16:48.794
I bid you adieu.

16:48.795 --> 16:50.962
No, seriously, don't!

16:54.066 --> 16:57.637
Ooh, I'm next!

16:57.638 --> 16:59.872
I don't mean to burst your bubble,

16:59.873 --> 17:02.441
but your friend's in a lot of trouble.

17:02.442 --> 17:04.210
What I'm saying is:

17:04.211 --> 17:06.212
that's not part of the room.
That's just for show.

17:06.213 --> 17:08.446
You're not supposed to jump in it.

17:08.448 --> 17:10.182
I'm not next.

17:10.183 --> 17:13.319
So that's not a cute rabbit hole?

17:13.319 --> 17:15.186
Rabbits? No.

17:15.188 --> 17:16.155
Couple of rats, though.

17:16.156 --> 17:19.758
This place is a deathtrap.

17:19.759 --> 17:21.993
Caroline, please tell me you're okay.

17:21.994 --> 17:24.262
(Caroline) I can't, because I'm not.

17:24.263 --> 17:27.299
I'll use the emergency code
to get us out of here.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.468
5...9... 4... 7.

17:29.469 --> 17:31.103
[alarm buzzes]

17:31.104 --> 17:32.671
Okay, I'm gonna be real
honest with you right now.

17:32.672 --> 17:35.007
I don't know the codes.

17:35.008 --> 17:37.443
(Caroline) Help, there's
something moving down here!

17:37.444 --> 17:38.481
I'm going in.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.145
Sophie, give me the
pepper spray flashlight.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.346
All right, yeah.

17:41.347 --> 17:43.048
Hurry!
[pepper spray fizzes]

17:43.049 --> 17:46.118
That really does sting.

17:46.119 --> 17:49.054
[monkey screeching]

17:49.055 --> 17:52.157
Okay, Oleg, now it's time.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.859
It's that beautiful moment

17:53.860 --> 17:55.794
where you and I are gonna make a baby

17:55.795 --> 17:59.131
right in front of your coworkers.

17:59.132 --> 18:00.432
Can we have a little more class

18:00.433 --> 18:03.201
and wait till we get in the cab?

18:03.202 --> 18:04.569
What?

18:04.570 --> 18:06.271
We're gonna do it on top of teacups.

18:06.272 --> 18:07.938
That's pretty classy.

18:11.476 --> 18:12.477
[grunts and moans]

18:12.478 --> 18:13.645
What is happening?

18:13.646 --> 18:14.913
You know what?

18:14.914 --> 18:17.315
Spray some of that stuff in my eyes.

18:17.316 --> 18:18.783
Max, look.

18:18.784 --> 18:21.453
Oh, that's why his leg's up in the air.

18:21.454 --> 18:24.956
I've seen enough. I'm out.

18:24.957 --> 18:26.591
[shrieks] Ow!

18:26.592 --> 18:29.527
Ugh, I think I landed
on what was moving.

18:29.528 --> 18:31.496
So that's dead now.

18:31.497 --> 18:33.365
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

18:33.366 --> 18:35.066
Yeah, I think. Are you?

18:35.067 --> 18:36.301
Yeah.

18:36.302 --> 18:38.570
Wait, you said you weren't okay.

18:38.571 --> 18:41.306
I meant emotionally.

18:41.307 --> 18:44.409
I jumped into a floor hole for feelings?

18:44.410 --> 18:46.511
Well, my feelings are really hurt, Max.

18:46.512 --> 18:47.712
It's been four years.

18:47.713 --> 18:48.880
Well, I don't know what to do,

18:48.881 --> 18:51.015
because like the Sad Hatter said,

18:51.016 --> 18:53.218
time goes forward; it doesn't go back.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.786
I can't undo the rent thing.

18:54.787 --> 18:56.421
I just thought we were
in this together,

18:56.422 --> 18:57.522
50/50.

18:57.523 --> 18:58.756
We are,

18:58.757 --> 19:00.558
and I should have told
you four years ago,

19:00.559 --> 19:02.593
but I thought we wouldn't last a month.

19:02.594 --> 19:04.996
But then we did, and
then another month,

19:04.997 --> 19:07.565
and I'm still not sure
how this happened:

19:07.566 --> 19:09.634
we became best friends.

19:09.635 --> 19:12.537
Max, that's the first time
you've ever called me

19:12.538 --> 19:14.238
your best friend without a bribe,

19:14.239 --> 19:17.208
and that's worth a lot more than money,

19:17.209 --> 19:19.577
and you know how much I love money.

19:19.578 --> 19:22.613
Yeah, you almost ruined
our friendship over it.

19:22.614 --> 19:24.248
All right, come on,
let's get out of here.

19:24.249 --> 19:26.817
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

19:26.818 --> 19:27.885
I'm not okay.

19:27.886 --> 19:30.254
Searing pain, searing pain.

19:30.255 --> 19:33.891
Ugh, I think I twisted my ankle
when I jumped down here.

19:33.892 --> 19:36.460
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

19:36.461 --> 19:37.828
You're right.

19:37.829 --> 19:39.630
Sometimes sorry just doesn't cut it.

19:39.631 --> 19:41.465
So how are we gonna
get you out of here?

19:41.466 --> 19:42.700
If you want me to carry you,

19:42.701 --> 19:45.536
you'll have to take off your boobs.

19:45.537 --> 19:47.271
Which way should we go?

19:47.272 --> 19:50.074
My sense of direction led me
to being a waitress in Brooklyn.

19:50.075 --> 19:51.675
You know what? Let's go forward.

19:51.676 --> 19:53.944
'Cause much like the
time, you can't go back.

19:53.945 --> 19:56.080
Also, the moving thing just
came to and looks mad.

19:56.081 --> 19:58.749
Go.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.986
Max, I've never been this
close to your butt before,

20:01.987 --> 20:03.821
and it's spectacular!

20:03.822 --> 20:05.589
What's your secret?

20:05.590 --> 20:09.026
I'm 27.

20:09.027 --> 20:10.661
(Sophie and Oleg)
[moaning and grunting]

20:10.662 --> 20:15.032
(Han) I really shouldn't be seeing this.

20:15.033 --> 20:17.801
(Earl) Can we please turn
the lights back off?

20:17.802 --> 20:20.237
(Sophie) Oh, God, help me!

20:20.238 --> 20:21.972
Well, one good thing
about being down here:

20:21.973 --> 20:24.675
Sophie and Oleg are up there.

20:24.676 --> 20:27.644
Wait, why is the floor sagging?

20:27.645 --> 20:32.316
[both screaming]

20:32.317 --> 20:33.950
Oh, my God.

20:33.951 --> 20:36.586
You know, I'm pretty sure that fall

20:36.587 --> 20:40.524
knocked the baby right up into me.

20:40.525 --> 20:44.227
Correction, if I could
turn the clock back,

20:44.228 --> 20:48.263
I wouldn't go back four years.
I'd go back 30 seconds.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.668
[rock music]
