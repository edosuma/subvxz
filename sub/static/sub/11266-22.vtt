WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
Previously on 90210:

00:10.678 --> 00:12.137
She messed with my pills.
Th-there's no way

00:12.179 --> 00:13.681
that she would do
something like that.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.975
You're right. You're right.
I'm...

00:16.015 --> 00:17.267
I'm just being paranoid.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.436
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I wrote my paper.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.729
I know you didn't write it.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.356
I may have

00:22.397 --> 00:24.984
made a few changes to your paper
after you went to sleep.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.944
Hey, I'm sorry.
I can't believe
you did this.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.743
I drove Navid home.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.454
He kissed me.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.622
Did you kiss her?

00:38.664 --> 00:40.332
I can't remember.
I was drinking, and...

00:40.374 --> 00:43.002
Hey!
I never want
to see you again.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.670
I'm dying, Ivy!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.672
I want to be there... you know,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.799
until the end,
if that's what it comes down to.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.301
Then, marry me.
Yes.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.850
♪ ♪

00:57.892 --> 01:01.478
(school bell rings,
students cheer)

01:13.198 --> 01:16.535
I've never been called to
the principal's office before.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.203
Can't believe
I'm in trouble.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.330
You're the one
who cheated, not me.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.666
Look, I screwed
up, Naomi,

01:22.708 --> 01:24.376
and I am...
I'm so sorry.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.086
I just knew how important
going to CU was to you,

01:27.128 --> 01:29.088
and I am good at writing
papers, so I thought...

01:30.424 --> 01:32.843
You know what really
pissed me off?

01:32.885 --> 01:35.721
The fact that you thought
my paper needed rewriting.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.305
I mean,

01:37.347 --> 01:39.391
do you think I'm dumb?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.394
No. I think you're brilliant.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.021
I do. I think
you're hilarious

01:44.063 --> 01:47.066
and... perceptive
and honest, and I...

01:47.106 --> 01:49.234
I love the way
your brain works.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.570
You love my brain?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.239
I love...

01:58.285 --> 02:00.245
Well, a lot of
things about you.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.123
And...

02:03.164 --> 02:05.584
I love a lot of things
about you, too.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.252
And...

02:09.128 --> 02:11.423
I forgive you.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.259
(whispering):
Thank you.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.556
(sighs)

02:19.598 --> 02:21.892
You've really never been to
the principal's office before?

02:21.934 --> 02:23.685
Not against my will.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.063
Okay. Don't say a word.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.023
What they have right now
is a theory,

02:28.065 --> 02:29.108
and a theory is worthless.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.443
Without proof, they cannot
punish us, okay?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.778
NOWACK:
This...

02:32.820 --> 02:34.655
is the paper in question,

02:34.696 --> 02:37.240
allegedly written by you, Naomi.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.034
MR. PHILLIPS:
And this is a paper

02:39.076 --> 02:41.078
written for my
European History class

02:41.120 --> 02:42.287
two years ago.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.373
Similar ideas, some of the same
turns of phrase

02:45.415 --> 02:47.208
written by... guess who.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.251
Max Miller.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.130
Clearly, there was
cheating involved.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.090
So, let's see...

02:53.132 --> 02:56.301
Either the prom queen,
with a reputation for lying,

02:56.343 --> 02:58.345
copied her
boyfriend's paper,

02:58.386 --> 03:02.307
or our class valedictorian--
with his perfect GPA--

03:02.349 --> 03:04.977
conspired with her to cheat.

03:06.145 --> 03:07.604
Come on, Naomi.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.690
Why don't you just
admit what you did?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.653
Fine.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.571
Well, if neither one of you
comes forward,

03:16.613 --> 03:17.572
I have to assume

03:17.614 --> 03:18.824
you both were involved,

03:18.866 --> 03:20.117
and you'll both be expelled.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.576
Expelled?
NOWACK:
We have an honor code

03:21.618 --> 03:23.037
at West Beverly
and a no-tolerance policy

03:23.078 --> 03:24.121
when it comes to cheating,

03:24.163 --> 03:25.288
so yes, you will
both be expelled.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
Which, of course, means
you can forget about CU

03:27.332 --> 03:28.207
and Caltech.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.210
It wasn't a conspiracy.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.342
It was all me.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.468
I copied Max's paper.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.803
He had nothing to do with it.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.514
NOWACK:
Thank you, Naomi.
Um...

03:42.556 --> 03:45.100
Now, that was not so hard,
was it?

03:57.821 --> 03:59.614
So what is this important news?

04:02.076 --> 04:03.451
Ivy and I are engaged.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.870
What?

04:04.912 --> 04:09.124
And because I'm starting chemo
next week... um,

04:09.166 --> 04:10.876
we want to get married soon.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.003
Like, in the next few days.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.048
Maataa. Pitaa.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.052
I know you wanted me to have
an arranged marriage like you.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.221
And I know that Ivy
isn't Indian.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.723
But I love her.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.058
And she loves me.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.726
And-and-and we want to spend

04:27.768 --> 04:29.895
the rest of our lives together
as husband and wife,

04:29.937 --> 04:31.813
officially
and legally.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.734
I recognize this isn't
what you expected,

04:35.776 --> 04:38.070
but if you can find it
in your hearts

04:38.112 --> 04:39.238
to-to-to support us...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.406
Of course.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.783
(chuckles)
What?

04:44.952 --> 04:47.037
We are just happy
that you are happy.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.916
You have our blessing,
of course, betaa.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.754
Thank you, Ivy,
for loving my son.
Thank you

04:55.796 --> 04:56.671
for being okay with this.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.261
LAUREL:
I'm not okay with this.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.678
IVY:
What?

05:03.720 --> 05:06.265
Why?
Ivy,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.850
you're 18 years old.
You're a kid.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.394
You're not ready to make
this kind of commitment.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.938
And I'm sorry,
but you're not doing this.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.439
Yes, I am, Mom.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.233
I am. And, look, I love you,

05:16.275 --> 05:17.776
but I also love Raj.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.611
Yeah, and you're right,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.280
I'm 18, and that means
I'm an adult,

05:21.321 --> 05:22.906
and I can make
my own decisions now.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.866
Look, I get that you two
love each other.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.534
And that's great, but...

05:26.576 --> 05:27.828
you know,
live together.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.370
I mean, do whatever.
Just...

05:29.412 --> 05:31.790
there's no need
for you to get married.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.583
But why not? I mean, why
shouldn't we get married?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.630
Ivy...
Mom...

05:38.672 --> 05:40.590
I'm going to marry Raj,

05:40.632 --> 05:42.217
and it would mean
the world to me

05:42.259 --> 05:43.760
if you were there
to give me away.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.513
I can't.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.435
I can't support this marriage.
I can't.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.652
Ooh, I like that color.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.571
West Bev blue in honor
of graduation.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.698
Okay, wait. Tell me
what you think

06:04.739 --> 06:06.908
about this nail art
the lady did on my big toe?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.535
It turned out
a little funky, right?

06:08.576 --> 06:09.995
No. I think it's cute.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.454
What is it?

06:11.496 --> 06:14.333
What? It's supposed
to be a wildcat.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.668
I don't know, it looks
more like a demon

06:16.710 --> 06:18.419
or, like a...
like a bagel with teeth.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.754
(laughing):
Look...

06:19.796 --> 06:20.881
I think it's cute.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.175
Well, who cares
what people think?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.718
Freedom of nail
expression is just one

06:24.759 --> 06:27.470
of the many advantages
of not having a boyfriend.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.348
Are you okay?

06:29.388 --> 06:30.598
I'm fine.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.808
I mean, I'm...

06:31.850 --> 06:34.853
(sighs)
I'm heartbroken.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.564
Heartbroken-slash-
really pissed off.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.359
But... I'm okay.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.111
I got my friends,
you know?

06:43.153 --> 06:45.322
Yeah.

06:45.364 --> 06:48.325
Can I just say how grateful
I am that we're still friends?

06:48.367 --> 06:50.409
Me, too.

06:50.451 --> 06:51.870
I mean, we had a rough year,

06:51.912 --> 06:53.872
but... we made it through,
didn't we?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.290
Yeah.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.709
I mean, we've been friends
since we were little.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.502
We're going to be friends
when we're old ladies.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.503
Yeah, we are.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.340
Come here.
Okay. I'm...
I'm coming.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.217
Don't mess it up.
Good-bye, sweetie.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.885
All right.
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.345
I'll see you later.
Bye.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.690
(car engine starts)

07:22.109 --> 07:24.069
(Adrianna screams)

07:24.111 --> 07:26.029
(pants)

07:26.071 --> 07:28.031
JAVIER:
All these lies.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.325
You really think you're going
to get away with it?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.993
I'm tired.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.828
There's no one here.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.914
You're dead.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.498
Don't you learn?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.543
You stole my songs,
and everybody found out.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.753
And yet here you are,

07:41.795 --> 07:43.755
lying to Navid,
lying to Silver.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.090
Come on.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.217
How do you think
this is going to end?

07:47.259 --> 07:48.551
I'm okay. Everything...

07:48.593 --> 07:50.845
is going to be okay.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.390
No, no. It's not.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.551
NAOMI:
Hey, blondie.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
You wearing anything
under that robe?

08:32.261 --> 08:35.140
Hi. And yes, I am.
Thank you very much.
Have I taught you nothing?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.390
I didn't know you
were coming today.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.558
Of course I'm here.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.934
I wouldn't miss
you guys graduating.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.727
Are you kidding?
I can't believe
you're expelled.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.938
I'm so sorry
about that.
Oh... what are you
going to do?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.232
Well, what about CU?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.027
I guess I'll get my GED
and see what happens next.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.570
Maybe they'll... let me
in next year. Who knows?
Yeah.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.240
So, what are you going to do
about this weekend? Parties.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.951
You going to go with us
to Melissa Manning's tomorrow?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.995
Um, no.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.081
Actually, I-I can't.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.542
Well, what do you mean,
you can't?
Because...

09:02.583 --> 09:04.169
Raj and I are kind
of getting married.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.837
(screams)

09:05.879 --> 09:08.548
Oh, my God!
(laughs) Thank you,

09:08.589 --> 09:09.716
I think.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.426
(screams)

09:11.468 --> 09:13.387
Really?
Yeah, really.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.430
Now, trust me, I know
it's a little crazy...

09:15.472 --> 09:17.432
Oh, no!
It-it's romantic!

09:17.474 --> 09:19.684
It's crazy, yes,
but good crazy--

09:19.726 --> 09:21.602
wonderful crazy.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.063
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.231
(giggles)

09:24.272 --> 09:26.024
Well, tell me everything.
When? Where?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.150
Who are you wearing?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.693
No, I'm-I'm
going to keep it

09:28.735 --> 09:29.694
super, super low-key.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.113
Well... well, how low-key?

09:32.155 --> 09:34.032
You know, like, maybe
I'll just have a ceremony

09:34.074 --> 09:35.867
and not some big party.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.954
Look, my mom doesn't really
approve of the whole thing,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.082
so she's not going
to be coming to the wedding.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.625
Oh. I'm sorry, Ivy.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.960
Well, I'll deal.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.255
And Raj's family
wants us to have

09:48.296 --> 09:49.506
a traditional
Indian wedding,

09:49.548 --> 09:51.132
so we'll probably
just have the ceremony

09:51.174 --> 09:52.467
in his parents'
living room.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.261
In Raj's parents' living room?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.137
Naomi, getting married

09:56.179 --> 09:58.265
isn't the important part;
being married is.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.142
I don't know who told you that,
but that is just not true.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.810
There is nothing more
important than the wedding.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.145
The wedding...
Okay, okay...

10:04.187 --> 10:06.314
is the party part
of getting married. It's...

10:06.356 --> 10:08.275
I'm going to throw you
a wedding.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.444
(screaming): I'm going
to throw you a wedding!

10:10.485 --> 10:12.904
(screams)
(laughs)

10:12.946 --> 10:15.073
(Naomi laughs)

10:15.115 --> 10:17.658
Oh, my gosh,
you're getting married!
I know.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.869
♪ ♪

10:22.163 --> 10:23.415
(music stops, car engine stops,
door closes)

10:23.457 --> 10:25.625
Hey! There you are.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.876
You're late!

10:26.918 --> 10:28.169
Yeah, I know.
(laughs)

10:28.211 --> 10:31.089
Hey.
Let's go graduate.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.507
You know what?
What's that?

10:32.549 --> 10:35.051
I don't think I've ever been
so happy in my whole life.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.887
I mean, this-- right here--
this is my happy high point.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.180
Yeah? That's cool.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.681
Everything's just
working out so perfectly.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.476
I mean, we made it
through high school.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.643
I inherited a fortune,

10:43.684 --> 10:45.562
so college tuition's
taken care of.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.231
I got into Carnegie Mellon;
you're into Drexel.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.609
And we are going
to live together.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.860
ANNIE:
I found this amazing apartment.

10:52.902 --> 10:53.945
It's huge.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.696
Can we talk
about this later?
Why?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.199
I would just really rather not
talk about this right now,

10:58.241 --> 10:59.534
like, right before graduation.

10:59.576 --> 11:00.827
Hey, wait.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.036
Tell me what's going on.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.039
(sighs)

11:05.081 --> 11:06.458
I don't want to go to Drexel.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.543
What?
Yeah.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.962
I mean, I don't want to
go to college at all.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.549
Oh, my God.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.967
I mean, all this time,
you've just been

11:16.009 --> 11:18.386
pretending that you wanted
to have a life with me?

11:18.428 --> 11:21.389
I... well, I mean,
I didn't mean to. I just...

11:21.431 --> 11:24.559
I didn't know how to bring it up
to you that I was having doubts.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.061
Doubts about school.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.939
So... are these
just doubts, then?

11:29.981 --> 11:31.566
No.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.026
I mean, yes.
I was having doubts.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.402
But when I got the
acceptance letter,

11:34.444 --> 11:36.070
I knew I didn't want to go.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.906
But you didn't
mention it to me?
(sighs)

11:38.948 --> 11:40.575
I didn't want to hurt you.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.494
I love you, Annie.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.830
Mm-hmm.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.248
Um...

11:47.290 --> 11:50.251
I can't do this.

11:50.293 --> 11:54.088
You and me... I can't...

11:54.130 --> 11:55.590
What? What does that mean?
It means

11:55.632 --> 11:57.592
that we have spent
the past six months

11:57.634 --> 11:59.927
planning a future
that you don't even want.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.805
It means I can't trust you.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.685
Are you breaking up with me?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.021
Yeah.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.106
Yeah, I... I am.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.441
Annie.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.652
Good-bye, Liam.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.575
NOWACK:
This is an achievement,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.577
earned the hard way.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.078
By working hard, by stumbling,

12:25.119 --> 12:27.788
by falling down
and getting back up again.

12:27.830 --> 12:31.125
By persevering.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.003
And so I ask you, Class of 2011,

12:34.045 --> 12:36.130
to take pride
in what you have earned.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.093
I know that I am very,
very proud of you indeed.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.721
And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce someone

12:42.761 --> 12:44.472
of whom I am particularly proud,

12:44.514 --> 12:47.975
the valedictorian
of the Class of 2011,

12:48.017 --> 12:49.310
Max Miller.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.104
(cheering and applause)

12:57.402 --> 12:59.153
BOY:
You're my boy, Max!

13:00.779 --> 13:02.990
Thank you, Principal Nowack.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.451
Good afternoon, everybody.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.582
"Commencement."

13:10.624 --> 13:11.958
What does that word mean?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.502
Well, if you don't know,
perhaps you shouldn't

13:14.544 --> 13:16.129
be graduating from high school.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.464
(quiet laughter)

13:17.505 --> 13:21.134
Um, to commence is to begin.

13:21.175 --> 13:25.597
And so, as we step forward
into our futures,

13:25.639 --> 13:27.515
we should take
a moment and think.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.184
What do we want to be
when we grow up?

13:31.978 --> 13:34.397
What kind of person
do you want to be?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.782
What... kind of person
do you want to be?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.827
I'm sorry.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.540
I'm sorry.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.626
I can't do this.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.377
I... I was the one who cheated.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.796
Not Naomi.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.006
I... I screwed up.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.300
I broke the honor code,
and I'm sorry.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.718
But she should be
graduating here, not me.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.346
I'm... I'm sorry, Naomi.
I'm...

14:06.387 --> 14:08.847
Uh, congratulations, everybody.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.475
NOWACK:
Uh, well...

14:10.517 --> 14:13.645
NOWACK:
Can everyone please quiet...

14:13.687 --> 14:14.895
can everyone just please stand?

14:14.937 --> 14:18.525
West Beverly Hills High School,
Class of 2011,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.193
I hereby proclaim

14:20.234 --> 14:21.569
that you are officially

14:21.611 --> 14:23.404
graduates.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.864
Congratulations!

14:24.905 --> 14:27.617
(cheering)

14:30.620 --> 14:31.746
Why'd you do that?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.790
What about Caltech?

14:33.832 --> 14:35.667
You didn't have
to do that.
Yes, I did.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.043
Because when I think
about the future,

14:37.084 --> 14:39.587
I want to be the kind of guy
who deserves a girl like you.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.644
Ooh, that tickles.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.978
Well, keep still.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.021
ADRIANNA:
That is amazing.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.941
Yeah. It's mesmerizing.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.902
Mm-hmm. Like watching
paint dry.

15:02.943 --> 15:03.986
Naomi.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.279
I'm sorry,
but you asked

15:05.321 --> 15:06.656
for a bachelorette party.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.948
No. Actually, I didn't.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.325
And, quite frankly,

15:09.367 --> 15:10.618
Amish bachelorettes
are wilder than this.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.955
Bachelor party!

15:15.998 --> 15:17.917
Come on, dudes!
Bachelor party!

15:18.877 --> 15:20.837
Bachelor party!
Yeah!

15:20.879 --> 15:23.339
Bachelor party!
Bachelor party!

15:23.381 --> 15:24.965
For the guest of honor.
Thank you.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.092
Both of them, dude.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.553
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.179
Cheers.
Cheers it up. Yeah.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.307
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.852
Hey, um...
So how you doing, man?

15:35.894 --> 15:38.020
I'm doing all right, man.
I'm doing pretty well.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.441
I should get married more
often. This is pretty fun.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.859
Just wait till Terry gets here.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.360
Terry?

15:44.402 --> 15:46.362
Oh, no. A stripper?

15:46.404 --> 15:47.864
SIDD:
Did you say stripper?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.783
There's going to be
a stripper here?

15:49.824 --> 15:51.618
Hell, yes.
Hell, yeah!

15:51.659 --> 15:53.202
SIDD:
Yeah, man.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.538
Think my cousin's having
more fun than me.
Yeah.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.791
Anyways, um, you know,
I'm really happy

15:57.832 --> 15:59.166
for you and Ivy.
You know, I...

15:59.208 --> 16:00.794
wish you guys
all the best, man.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.963
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.548
It means a lot to have
you guys' support,

16:05.590 --> 16:07.675
you know?
Mm-hmm.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.720
You know Ivy's mom isn't coming
to the wedding, right?

16:10.762 --> 16:12.305
She doesn't approve.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.307
Really?

16:14.348 --> 16:15.809
Laurel's usually real cool.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.894
Not about this.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.563
I mean, it's okay, but I just
feel bad for Ivy, you know.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.232
Yeah.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.984
(doorbell rings)

16:25.025 --> 16:26.068
Stripper time!

16:26.110 --> 16:28.237
Stripper time.
Stay right here.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.990
I thought they were joking.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.035
Good evening.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.078
Uh...

16:36.120 --> 16:39.165
Hey, officer.
Um...

16:39.206 --> 16:41.250
What seems to be the problem?

16:41.292 --> 16:44.253
I'm afraid some neighbors have
complained of a disturbance.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.422
They have?
Yes.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.174
Maybe I should come in

16:48.215 --> 16:50.259
and frisk some people.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.637
What?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.013
Oh, no.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.390
LIAM: Oh, no.
Oh, no, hey, guys,
guys, it's okay.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.767
I'm not a cop.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.935
I'm Terry.

16:58.977 --> 17:00.603
You're Terry.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.396
He's Terry.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.732
NAOMI:
All right, ladies.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.442
It's time to get
the party started.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.694
(giggling)

17:07.734 --> 17:09.779
Cocktails for everyone.
Thank you.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.531
Thank you.

17:12.573 --> 17:16.536
Oh, and the ice cubes are made
in the shape of little penises.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.287
No, thank you.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.123
What?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.416
Oh, my God.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.044
You won't wear
the headband

17:25.085 --> 17:27.128
with the phallic antenna, you
won't play spin the bottle...

17:27.171 --> 17:29.716
You expect me to play spin the
bottle with my fiancé's cousin?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.426
Okay, how about a drinking game?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.136
No, no drinking games.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.388
NAOMI:
Fine.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.473
The game is... I'll drink,

17:37.515 --> 17:40.727
and you can time me and see
how long it take me to pass out.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.978
(doorbell rings)

17:42.020 --> 17:44.689
Mmm. Mmm.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.110
I'm afraid some neighbors have
complained about a disturbance.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.654
Please tell me
you're a stripper.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.573
Maybe I should come in and, uh,

17:53.614 --> 17:55.408
frisk some people.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.994

Oh, hell, yes.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.164
Sorry.
Come on.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.673
Well, uh, there seemed
to be a mix-up,

18:10.715 --> 18:11.716
and we found ourselves

18:11.758 --> 18:13.092
with a prepaid male stripper
on our hands.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.636
We were wondering
if maybe you would want...

18:15.678 --> 18:18.014
A male stripper
on my hands. Yeah.
