04:01.575 --> 04:04.328
Are you okay? Sure?
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.418
Yeah, go check the son of
a bitch out in the car.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.041
Go on.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.942
Buddy. Are you okay?
Fine. But thanks for asking.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.862
Get your goddamn hands off me.
Open the door.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.194
Don't go for the shotgun.
Just open the door.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.109
My leg!

04:36.902 --> 04:38.779
It's broken.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.491
Come here.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.034
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:44.367 --> 04:47.541
Move. You know the routine,
old man. Hands behind your back.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.456
Arms behind your back and walk.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.592
My leg.
Move aside.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.423
My arm.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.260
What's broken,
your arm or your leg?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.383
Your face.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.893
Come on. Let's go.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.400
Okay. Let them all go.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.936
Bring his fat ass back here.
Do it!

05:12.229 --> 05:14.823
Come on.
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.743
- Come on, get up!
- Come on.

05:19.903 --> 05:23.328
Come on. Get up here.
Come here, goddamn it.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.744
- Come on. Come on, move it!
- Get me out of here!

05:26.910 --> 05:28.287
- Get out!
- Move it!

05:28.578 --> 05:29.579
Unh!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.128
Shit! Shit!

05:59.985 --> 06:02.784
Steal the car, go to hell.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.615
Shit.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.785
Hey, buddy.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.291
Whoo! Let's go.
Come on.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.556
Whoo! I told you I'd get you out.
I did it.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.479
Ugh!

06:31.766 --> 06:34.315
Billy!
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.278
It should have been me in jail.
Not you. It should have been me.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.992
Do you forgive me?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.704
I forgive you, Billy.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.202
I'm glad, man.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.833
I couldn't...

06:52.996 --> 06:57.627
I couldn't have that hanging
over me for the rest of my life.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.753
Billy...

07:53.431 --> 07:55.604
You think that ought
to hold you?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.519
And some whisky.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.737
I wouldn't sell meat
without whisky.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.157
What are you doing up this way?
Hunting.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.569
In a suit?

08:08.113 --> 08:11.834
Heh. What kind of hunting?
Pink flamingos.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.416
State police have
rounded up 12 of the 18 prisoners

08:15.578 --> 08:17.546
in yesterday's prison bus escape.

08:17.706 --> 08:21.131
Authorities said that the six
prisoners still unaccounted for

08:21.292 --> 08:24.671
are to be considered
possibly armed and dangerous.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.717
The bus...
You ever see any pink flamingos?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.019
No, sir.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.179
Never have,

08:33.929 --> 08:35.557
never will.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.145
You sure?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.650
Yes, sir.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.278
How much?

10:42.642 --> 10:46.488
- Do we have to go now?
- Yes.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.362
Thanks for leaving me this mess.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.902
You're welcome.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.035
And you didn't make your beds.
Nope.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.250
Mommy, can we get another dog?

11:04.414 --> 11:05.791
We'll see, honey.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.959
Night-night.
Night-night.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.089
You too, pal.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.059
Good night, Morn.
Good night.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.644
Sleep well.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.805
Who named God "God"?

13:26.848 --> 13:27.895
God did.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.526
God named God "God"?
Mm-hm.

13:30.685 --> 13:35.065
Why didn't he name
himself Torn or Charlie?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.111
Can I put some salt on this, Morn?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.079
It's okay.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.539
It's okay. It's all right.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.799
That's the dynamite again, huh?

13:52.957 --> 13:54.550
Yes.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.758
Okay, honey. It's okay.
Just eat your breakfast.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.006
Where's the salt, Mom?

14:00.173 --> 14:04.098
It doesn't need any salt, Mookie.
Come on. Just a little.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.690
Bree, did you move the salt shaker?
No.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.439
I don't believe this.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.862
E.T. took it. He did.
Mookie.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.527
He was here. I heard him.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.446
When?
Last night.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.909
E.T.'s make-believe, honey.
He is not. He was here, Mom.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.375
Mookie, you've got to stop
making things up.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.211
I'm not.
You are. Please stop it!

15:31.347 --> 15:33.520
"â€œWorld's greatest dad."

16:15.725 --> 16:20.071
Hey, Sam, this is me, Billy. I wish I
can be there to split all that money.

16:20.229 --> 16:24.279
But I guess if you're listening to this,
then it's all yours now, right? Heh.

16:24.442 --> 16:28.663
Well, you deserve it, man. Being in
prison all that time because of me.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.074
Hey, I wonder which way
I'm headed.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.837
Either way, up or down, I guess I got a fifty-fifty
chance of meeting Elvis, huh? Heh, heh.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.547
How do you like that suit
I picked out for you?

16:38.706 --> 16:42.336
Anyhow, lay low and don't go getting
into things the way you sometimes do.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.345
Oh, and, Sam,

16:45.004 --> 16:46.927
I'm glad I knew you.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.639
Come in.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.390
Oh, come in, Lonnie.
Come in, come in.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.814
I want you to meet
Mr. Dunston.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.316
Lonnie Poole.
Hey.

18:20.474 --> 18:25.696
He'll be taking care of certain
aspects of security and surveying.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.276
Hey, well, don't mind me.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.447
I already briefed Mr. Dunston
on the situation here.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.536
So how are things
with Mrs. Anderson?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.201
She's hardheaded
but we're gonna work it out.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.661
We're gonna need her parcel

18:41.370 --> 18:43.543
and the Lewis place next to her.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.505
Well, it's 120 acres in the middle
of the development.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.461
I know that, Mr. Hale.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.722
We gotta go forward without them.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.389
What's your security training, Mr.
Dunston?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.767
Cleveland Police Department.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.647
Why did you leave?

19:01.557 --> 19:02.809
Pick a card.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.441
Heh, heh, heh.
Take it. Take it.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.652
Oh, go on. Pick a card.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.160
You got it?
Yeah.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.413
All right,
put it back in the deck.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.873
Let me ask you a question, Lonnie.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.912
This Anderson woman,
you fucking her?

19:23.746 --> 19:26.249
None of your goddamn business.
Who is this guy?

19:26.415 --> 19:29.294
Didn't mean anything by it.
I don't have to take this shit.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.714
I didn't mean anything
by it, man. I'm sorry.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.262
Hey.-

19:39.428 --> 19:41.772
Was that your card?
No.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.558
No?

19:44.642 --> 19:46.440
I must be slipping.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.611
Lonnie, why don't you go back
to work.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.659
Hey, good to meet you, Lonnie.
Sorry about that.

20:01.617 --> 20:05.463
You know, I'm not too optimistic
about our young friend's success.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.966
Some of these landowners
can be hard nuts to crack.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.174
Then we use a hammer.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.131
That was nice.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.845
It was.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.560
He come to see you again?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.352
I don't wanna talk
about this, Lonnie.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.864
You know they're blasting
over at the Braemer's again.

21:13.189 --> 21:17.615
Turn the whole thing into a lake.
I know. My whole house shakes.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.570
So what?

21:21.197 --> 21:23.074
Well, these people,

21:24.533 --> 21:27.207
when they want something,
they can play rough.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.964
What are you saying?
I worry about you.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.920
I live here.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.043
They don't scare me.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.178
You're something, you know that?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.215
I'll see you.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.725
I'm not gonna give up my home.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.038
E.T., is that you?

23:39.793 --> 23:42.387
How come you didn't throw
the ball back?

23:43.088 --> 23:44.931
Did you come down
from outer space?

23:46.175 --> 23:47.176
No.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.471
How come you've got a gun?

23:50.095 --> 23:52.018
Are you a bad guy?

23:52.848 --> 23:54.316
No.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.687
You like boobs?

24:00.356 --> 24:01.357
Sometimes.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.868
I think they're gross.
I think they're totally gross.

24:05.694 --> 24:06.991
My name is Mike.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.998
But everybody calls me Mookie.
What's your name?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.503
Sam.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.961
Well, see you tomorrow, Sam, okay?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.670
I may not be here tomorrow.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.895
Don't you know how to start a fire?

24:41.897 --> 24:45.492
You have to let the air get in
or it's not going to burn.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.869
Going to cook something?
A steak.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.418
Let me have it. I'll cook it for you.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.082
Shit.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.927
Mookie?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.425
Oh, God. Do you
have to ruin everything?

25:09.591 --> 25:12.561
I can be here.
You're not the boss of me.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.269
This is my sister, Bree.
This is Sam.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.274
I'm going to cook him a steak.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.437
Me and my dad, when we go
camping, he let me be the cook.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.196
You don't remember that.
Yes, I do.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.278
You were too little.
Morn said.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.535
I remember.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.446
Where's your dad now?

25:30.779 --> 25:33.248
Dead.
He had a "nurdism."

25:33.407 --> 25:36.911
An aneurysm. Don't you
even know anything?

25:37.077 --> 25:39.876
He's in the cemetery.
He's a skeleton.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.882
He is not.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.467
Mookie? Bree?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.631
Well, we've gotta go.
Bye, Sam.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.345
Hey.-

25:55.471 --> 25:57.974
Don't tell anyone you saw me here,
okay?

25:58.265 --> 25:59.642
Why not?

25:59.808 --> 26:02.436
Because he doesn't
want us to, all right?

26:02.686 --> 26:04.279
Come on.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.485
I'm gonna tell Mom.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.034
You better not,
I'll tell Morn you smoke.

26:09.193 --> 26:11.366
I do not.
You do now.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.562
Mommy,

26:38.514 --> 26:39.811
what happened to him?

26:42.392 --> 26:44.065
No!

26:44.228 --> 26:45.980
No! No!

26:46.230 --> 26:49.359
No! No!

26:49.566 --> 26:52.240
- Get away!
- Mommy.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.708
Morn. Mom, who are these guys?

27:05.040 --> 27:07.589
Stay down. Stay down.
Get out of the truck.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.753
You're scaring my children!

27:10.838 --> 27:13.057
Get out of the truck.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.100
Leave them alone.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.352
Sam.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.020
Who the hell are you?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.151
I'm the parking attendant.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.234
And you're bothering my customers.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.914
Come on.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.852
Ah!

28:19.448 --> 28:21.075
Stay there.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.960
Who are you?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.835
He's my friend. His name is Sam.

28:37.466 --> 28:40.265
Are you just gonna let him
stand there?

28:45.015 --> 28:46.733
What are you hunting?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.894
Deer, mostly.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.651
Deer is out of season.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.283
Yeah, and jack rabbit.

28:55.859 --> 28:58.362
We've got lots of rabbits, Morn.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.824
I don't allow hunting
on my property.

29:02.324 --> 29:03.371
I'm mostly camping.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.662
I don't allow camping either.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.336
Who were those men?

29:12.334 --> 29:14.712
Come on. Come on, kids, up to bed.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.051
Can we stay up for a little while?

29:17.214 --> 29:18.887
No. I mean it. Let's go.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.642
We didn't say good night to Sam.
Say good night and let's go.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.534
I'll be right up.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.539
Where are you from?

29:51.248 --> 29:52.374
Quebec.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.759
What do you do there?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.387
What difference does it make?

30:01.800 --> 30:04.019
It's an innocent question.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.392
I'm a lawyer.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.070
Where did you learn to fight like that?
Law school.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.316
Who were those guys?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.821
Poachers, I suspect.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.035
Thank you for the coffee.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.090
Good night, ma'am.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.760
Wait.

30:49.639 --> 30:53.985
You don't have to sleep in the woods.
Sleep in my barn for a night or two.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.322
No, thanks.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.193
You can hunt here all you want.

31:03.070 --> 31:06.620
I thought you didn't allow hunting.
Maybe I changed my mind.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.914
You're afraid those guys
will be back?

31:10.994 --> 31:12.541
Forget it.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.292
Wait. How much?

31:17.292 --> 31:18.965
How much for the barn?

31:21.129 --> 31:22.927
You don't have to pay me.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.137
Are you sure?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.019
Yes.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.615
Out of the way. Out of the way.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.207
Bree, I've told you about
running in front of the truck.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.999
You don't go in front of the truck
like that. Look, I have told you.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.635
Heh, heh.
It's not funny. I'll be right back.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.974
Did not.

32:09.803 --> 32:13.228
Hi. I thought you might
wanna wear these.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.585
Who the hell are you?
I'm a friend of Clydie's.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.710
Yeah. What's your name, friend?
Sam.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.380
Got a wallet in those pants? An ID?
Sure.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.015
Lonnie?
In here.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.808
I'm naked.
It doesn't bother me at all.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.108
Who is this guy?
What are you doing?

33:39.267 --> 33:40.735
Who is he?

33:41.228 --> 33:45.950
He's my cousin from Quebec.
He told me he was your friend.

33:46.316 --> 33:50.287
My third cousin on my mother's side.
What's wrong with you?

33:51.947 --> 33:54.951
Lonnie, this is ridiculous.
Put the gun down.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.546
Sorry.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.584
Can I talk to you a second?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.268
Do you want some more?

35:00.181 --> 35:02.855
Yeah. Thanks.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.406
Can you pass the salt?

35:25.999 --> 35:30.345
The old bike in the barn,
I would like to buy it.

35:32.255 --> 35:35.725
How much will you pay for it?
I don't know, 200?

35:36.051 --> 35:37.473
Three.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.554
Take it or leave it.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.061
I'll take it.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.398
Are you gonna go away on it?

35:47.312 --> 35:50.657
I'll have to fix it first.
It's too broken to be fixed.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.412
He's got a big penis.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.748
Bree!
He does.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.043
He was in the pond, washing.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.721
He's got an average penis.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.756
How do you know?
Because I saw it.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.266
Already?

36:16.424 --> 36:18.768
I don't wanna hear anymore
about penises.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.438
Are you gonna sleep in her bed?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.224
I said that's enough.

36:25.058 --> 36:28.608
No one's gonna sleep in my bed
except me.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.431
Did you change your mind?
You want to help me?

37:06.307 --> 37:07.809
No.

37:18.737 --> 37:22.833
It's a good offer. A better offer than
you'd get if you sold to anyone else.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.835
Well, I don't wanna sell it
to anyone else.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.004
I don't wanna sell it.

37:31.708 --> 37:35.258
Mrs. Anderson,
I know your financial situation.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.799
Forgive me
if this is a trifle indelicate.

37:39.174 --> 37:42.178
You might not be able
to make your payments.

37:42.510 --> 37:46.640
And if you can't make your payments,
the bank will be forced to foreclose.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.025
That's because you bought
into the bank.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.812
The bank never used to foreclose
until you came.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.696
Nevertheless, you must understand...

37:53.855 --> 37:57.234
It will take a month
to get the order to foreclose.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.323
She'd get a lawyer.

37:59.486 --> 38:00.863
He would file a writ.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.699
That would delay
a couple of months.

38:03.865 --> 38:06.209
You would have to go to trial.

38:07.243 --> 38:10.167
If you don't want to sell it,
don't sell it.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.461
Forgive me.
You are who, exactly?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.095
My cousin Sam.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.633
Oh, hello. Franklin Hale.
I'm delighted to meet you.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.060
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Anderson.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.934
Gentlemen, shall we?

38:34.395 --> 38:35.817
Bye.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.953
Astonishing, isn't it?

38:43.112 --> 38:47.242
One little woman in the middle of
a wheat field. And what is she doing?

38:49.577 --> 38:51.579
She's fucking us up.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.217
My proposed development

38:56.417 --> 38:59.261
is one of the largest of its kind
in the West

39:00.922 --> 39:05.928
And represents a total investment in
your community of nearly $1 billion.

39:06.636 --> 39:10.106
Now, what we're talking about here
is natural beauty.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.609
I must tell you,

39:14.269 --> 39:16.897
I mean, this valley of yours,

39:17.313 --> 39:21.534
it's one of the most extraordinarily
beautiful places I've ever seen.

39:22.193 --> 39:25.788
I mean, it's quite remarkable.
And I do want to assure you,

39:25.947 --> 39:28.541
under no circumstances
would my company or myself

39:28.825 --> 39:32.420
ever dream
of desecrating such beauty.

39:32.662 --> 39:37.338
But you have in this town a lot of land
which can be used more efficiently.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.628
And in a way
that everyone would benefit.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.389
I wanna guarantee everyone...
You should be ashamed of yourself,

39:43.548 --> 39:45.767
selling your heritage
to this pitchman.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.177
Tom, you're out of line.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.643
Build your damn golf course
around me. I'm not selling my land.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.354
Let him speak. He
has the right to speak.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.314
Please, please, let him speak.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.478
My dear sir, at first glance,

39:57.645 --> 40:01.070
there's bound to be opposition
to a plan like this.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.735
But your council people,
who you have elected,

40:03.902 --> 40:07.156
they understand the wisdom
of our ideas.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.825
They have endorsed them
rather enthusiastically.

40:10.199 --> 40:13.248
It don't matter. I know the tactics
your people are using.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.708
That's not gonna work.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.340
Nobody's gonna tell me
what to do with my land.

40:17.498 --> 40:21.002
It's okay, Tom.
They can't make us sell.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.343
You sure?
Are you sure about that, Clydie?

40:26.466 --> 40:28.184
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.371
Sam! Sam! Something's wrong.
Come on, wake up.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.782
What?
Come on. Come on.

40:53.576 --> 40:56.079
It's our neighbor's barn, Sam.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.386
Mookie, wake up your mother.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.512
Tell her to call the fire department.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.390
Go. Go!

41:15.348 --> 41:17.521
Tom!
Are you okay?

41:17.684 --> 41:19.402
My husband's in there. Help him.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.437
Stay back. Stay!
Okay.

41:21.604 --> 41:24.198
Help him. Please help him.
Oh, please.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.028
Come on. Come on. Hiyah! Hiyah!

41:29.529 --> 41:31.122
Let me help.

41:31.531 --> 41:32.999
Come on.
Pull him out.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.752
Push or pull. Hiyah!

41:35.910 --> 41:38.004
Get out! Come on!
Get that one.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.750
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hiyah! Hiyah!

41:47.255 --> 41:48.757
Go, go!

41:52.427 --> 41:54.521
Let's go!
Hiyah! Hiyah!

42:08.901 --> 42:09.948
Torn!

42:11.070 --> 42:13.072
Oh, my God.
Oh, Tom.

42:17.618 --> 42:20.292
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

42:21.039 --> 42:22.757
Are you all right?

42:26.252 --> 42:29.472
The gas tanks. They're gonna go!

42:34.969 --> 42:37.142
Move back. Get back.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.185
Oh, my God.

42:42.351 --> 42:45.150
Clydie, the tanks are gonna blow.
Get back!

42:47.982 --> 42:49.700
Get back!

43:39.784 --> 43:40.831
Wow.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.333
Come on, we'll be all right.

44:03.391 --> 44:06.565
I never saw anything like it.
Did you get burned?

44:06.727 --> 44:08.525
No. I was lucky.

44:10.314 --> 44:14.239
Sam, are you gonna go home now?

44:17.321 --> 44:19.244
Are you going to stay?

44:19.574 --> 44:21.121
For a while.

44:21.576 --> 44:24.329
You're gonna go home sometime,
aren't you?

44:29.292 --> 44:30.418
Sam...

44:31.752 --> 44:34.471
I really don't remember my dad,

44:34.714 --> 44:36.432
not like I say I do.

44:39.302 --> 44:40.929
It's okay.

44:43.806 --> 44:47.106
You did good, Mookie,
discovering the fire.

44:48.519 --> 44:52.194
I wasn't scared.
I know.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.409
Good night.

44:59.947 --> 45:00.948
Good night.

45:11.667 --> 45:16.468
I've been out here on my own
ever since my husband died.

45:18.799 --> 45:21.928
I always thought I could handle
whatever came up.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.940
I don't know why I'm telling you this.
I don't even know you.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.360
Sam...

45:33.314 --> 45:35.408
ls that your real name?

45:36.484 --> 45:37.576
Yes.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.242
Sometimes you just get tired.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.163
I'll be okay tomorrow.

45:50.331 --> 45:52.675
Things will be better in the morning.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.318
Thanks.

46:52.852 --> 46:54.274
What is this stuff for?

46:54.437 --> 46:56.986
For the brakes.
Without it, the bike won't start.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.697
- What about this?
- That's gasket sealant.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.742
Hey, what kind of car
you working on?

47:04.071 --> 47:06.540
It's not for a car. A motorcycle.

47:07.533 --> 47:10.412
It's a moto... A what?
Motorcycle.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.046
Motorcycle.
Yeah.

47:13.247 --> 47:15.500
You're not from around here,
are you?

47:17.835 --> 47:21.385
Neither are you.
That's right. Neither am I.

47:21.547 --> 47:24.391
Hey, you're that Canadian guy,
right?

47:24.550 --> 47:27.804
Pulled old Tom Lewis
out of his burning barn.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.768
You're the guy, right?
You're him.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.773
He also saved all the horses too.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.274
He did? Wow.

47:35.728 --> 47:38.106
That must have really been
something.

47:38.397 --> 47:40.570
So, what kind?
What kind of what?

47:40.733 --> 47:42.110
What are we talking about?

47:42.276 --> 47:44.779
What kind of motorcycle
are you working on?

47:45.780 --> 47:46.906
A Triumph.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.700
Triumph.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.540
They don't make them
like that anymore. Do they?

47:53.746 --> 47:54.918
No, they don't.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.250
No, they don't.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.844
Let's go.

48:05.841 --> 48:07.138
Yeah, see you.

48:07.301 --> 48:10.350
Hey, good luck with
the motorcycle.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.947
How long does it take to learn
how to drive one of these?

48:20.106 --> 48:21.983
I can show you right now.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.278
I don't wanna know. As long
as you know what you're doing.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.538
Don't get caught.
You understand?

48:27.696 --> 48:29.824
I thought the local law
was taken care of.

48:29.990 --> 48:32.789
Yeah, he's been paid,
but I'm not sure he's bought.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.664
It's not for you to worry about.
Who's worried?

48:36.831 --> 48:38.333
Good.

48:39.792 --> 48:43.797
That your card?
Yeah. How did you do that?

48:44.046 --> 48:45.514
Magic.

48:49.552 --> 48:51.680
Mommy, is that your wedding?

48:52.847 --> 48:54.349
Yep.

49:02.481 --> 49:05.234
Come on in. Want some coffee?
Thank you.

49:05.401 --> 49:07.620
Sam, that's my dad.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.448
Come on, look at him.

49:28.382 --> 49:33.309
Mommy, why is Daddy
carrying you like that?

49:34.472 --> 49:36.895
Because that's what
the groom does.

49:37.057 --> 49:40.937
He carries his wife off, so they
can start their new life together.

49:45.399 --> 49:48.198
- That's me.
- So little.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.977
I bet he was a good kisser.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.444
Yes, he was.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.514
It's very beautiful here.

50:54.301 --> 50:56.474
It's the Valley of the Moon.

50:58.931 --> 51:00.649
That's what we called it.

51:01.141 --> 51:03.394
Can you smell the violets?

51:06.063 --> 51:09.818
There's no prettier smell on earth
than the smell of violets.

51:16.657 --> 51:18.830
You're not used to all this.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.004
You're not married, are you?

51:26.292 --> 51:28.010
Used to be.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.254
A long time ago.

51:45.436 --> 51:47.734
You miss your husband, don't you?

51:52.860 --> 51:54.612
Yes.

51:55.362 --> 51:59.208
There are days
when I miss him very much.

52:05.873 --> 52:08.422
Would you like to sleep
in my room tonight?

52:19.053 --> 52:20.555
You're a very special woman.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.863
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:05.265 --> 53:10.112
You're tuned to Night
Sounds where it's 1:30 in the morning

53:10.270 --> 53:13.945
and a very pleasant 65 degrees.

53:29.665 --> 53:31.793
Hi.
Hi.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.429
It's late, Lonnie.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.056
No later than it usually is.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.184
Come here.

53:47.266 --> 53:48.939
What's the matter?

53:49.977 --> 53:51.729
I just don't feel like it.

53:51.895 --> 53:53.442
Okay.

53:56.233 --> 53:59.112
Kids up?
No.

53:59.278 --> 54:01.030
What's the matter?

54:01.530 --> 54:06.502
You still upset about the Lewis' barn?
It has nothing to do with the barn.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.253
Then what?
I don't know.

54:08.412 --> 54:11.256
Well, when you figure it out,
you let me know.

54:25.804 --> 54:28.648
Guess she won't be growing
much here now.

55:24.071 --> 55:25.698
Ha! Ha!

56:07.447 --> 56:08.915
Son of a... Come here!

56:17.666 --> 56:18.792
Strike three.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.677
You're out.

56:27.009 --> 56:30.104
I don't know how much you know
about business, Mr. Dunston.

56:30.262 --> 56:32.890
These things can be
a little complicated.

56:33.056 --> 56:37.061
Let me clarify the situation.
What it comes down to is this:

56:37.227 --> 56:40.982
If I don't have Mrs. Anderson's land
by this week, I lose my permits.

56:41.148 --> 56:44.994
If I lose permits, I lose this deal.
If I lose this, I'm out of business.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.325
Now, if you
and your little pissant army

56:47.487 --> 56:49.990
can't persuade one woman
to sell me her land,

56:50.157 --> 56:52.876
I may have to find someone
who can.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.236
So, Lonnie Poole,
what did you find out about him?

57:23.398 --> 57:25.651
I know he's not her cousin.

57:26.944 --> 57:28.617
Good, Lonnie.

57:30.030 --> 57:32.374
Look, I don't care who he isn't.

57:32.532 --> 57:34.955
This asshole is really
beginning to bother me.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.540
Now I have to go out there,

57:36.703 --> 57:40.003
present him with some options
to sticking around here.

57:40.165 --> 57:41.212
Listen.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.880
I take it as a favor if you give me first
crack at making that presentation.

57:47.923 --> 57:49.220
Really?

57:49.383 --> 57:50.555
Really.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.646
Fine.

58:11.571 --> 58:12.743
Clydie is not here.

58:15.617 --> 58:17.244
I know that.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.379
I never did see
that identification.

58:19.538 --> 58:22.508
I thought we'd been through this.
Stop right there.

58:23.166 --> 58:26.591
Put your hands up against
the barn door. Move!

58:33.010 --> 58:34.637
Spread them.

58:36.847 --> 58:38.599
Are you arresting me?

58:38.765 --> 58:40.267
Maybe.

58:44.896 --> 58:46.569
What for?

58:46.940 --> 58:48.783
I haven't decided yet.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.289
Ugh!
Why don't you just leave her alone?

58:58.952 --> 59:02.252
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
You're fucking it all up.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.630
For everybody's sake,
just get out of here.

59:09.463 --> 59:10.589
Ugh!

59:14.468 --> 59:18.063
If you cared for her,
you would not be doing this.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:03.566
Sam?

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:07.563
Sam.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.989
What happened?
Ugh!

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.208
Does this have anything to do

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.711
with what happened
in the pasture last night?

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.050
Goddamn it.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.713
Who did this to you?
It was personal.

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:34.886
Why do you do that?

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.810
Why don't you talk to me?

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.562
I don't know who you are,
why you're here.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.234
Do you want me to go?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.020
Yes.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.149
No.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.243
I don't know, I...

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:04.332
I don't know what I want.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.586
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:46.354
Hi, Mom.
Hi, honey.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.392
Where's your sister?
I don't know, playing somewhere?

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.151
Where's Sam?
He's still asleep.

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:55.481
Uh-uh. He's not in the barn.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.153
He stayed in my room.
All night?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.780
Mm-hm.
All right. Can I go see him?

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.992
Honey, he's really tired.
Let him sleep for a few more hours.

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.377
A few more hours?

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.255
What did you do to him?
Mookie.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.885
Hello?

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.508
Hello?

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.435
Hi.
Hi.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.025
Does this little girl
belong to you?

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.895
- Bree, what were you doing?
- I was playing.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.563
He wanted to play with me.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:40.030
He can pull a magic card
out from my ear.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:44.362
He can? Come here.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.578
Mrs. Anderson, you shouldn't let
the child run around.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:48.913
Do I know you?

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.077
Nope.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:54.164
Go inside.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:05.183
Bye.
Bye-bye.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:09.559
Well, I'm surprised to see
that you're still here.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.817
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:23.786
If I see you near her or the children,
I'll kill you.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.747
Look, you seem like a smart fella.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:34.792
The woman isn't worth it.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.549
And I tell you,
when push comes to shove,

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:41.382
you're not gonna be dealing with
some tin badge, local sheriff guy.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.797
You're gonna be dealing with me.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:48.723
Okay?
I look forward to it.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:53.849
Me too.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.246
Yeah, for now.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:24.967
Whoa!

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.698
FBI just left my office.

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.618
What do you want?
I know who you are.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.711
I'm gonna do everybody a favor.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.668
Leave, just go somewhere else.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:02.710
Do it right now or I'm not gonna
be able to stop what'll happen.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.464
What about Clydie?
What about this place?

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:10.343
You're making it much worse for her
than it was ever supposed to be.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.221
If you care for her, you'll go.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.629
Jesus.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.778
I was a thief.
I don't care.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.109
There was a bank.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:07.444
And the guard got shot.

01:07:08.942 --> 01:07:10.239
So you're a murderer.

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.118
No.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.458
A boy, Billy.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.669
I took him with me
on a couple of jobs.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:27.092
The guard was going to shoot me.

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:30.180
Billy shot him first.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:32.090
But I was taken.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:34.351
You had no right.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.472
Damn you, you had no right
to come into our lives.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.821
You have to go.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.400
You're going to lose this place.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.160
No, I am not.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:56.623
I can take care of myself.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.661
I was doing just fine
before you came here.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.837
I have been alone a long time.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.340
So have I.

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.484
Now!

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.241
Mookie, you're it.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.993
Whoa.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.581
I said you're it.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:20.245
Clydie, I thought it might be
easier talking to you on tape,

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:22.703
but now I'm not so sure.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:33.053
Yeah, this is excellent, Lonnie.
This is excellent.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.261
Why'd you let him go?

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.886
You'd be famous now
if you'd collared him.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.517
Now doesn't seem the time

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:43.430
to have this place crawling
with state cops and FBI, does it?

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.689
You're quite right, Lonnie,
quite right.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:49.398
Now, that's what I like about you,
Lonnie, you're always thinking.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:54.320
Well, it shouldn't be too difficult to
break Mrs. Anderson's resistance now. Hm?

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:57.827
I'm gonna work on that right away.
Thank you, Lonnie.

01:10:08.079 --> 01:10:11.128
I don't care if our local sheriff
says he's left town.

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.920
I still think he's dangerous.
Me too.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:20.304
I think we should take
personal charge of the situation.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:26.436
Today, a little cooler
tonight, dropping down to the 50s.

01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:30.067
But tomorrow, another sunny day,
so make your plans.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.604
It's gonna be a beautiful day
out there.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:35.319
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.615
- What's new with you?
- Nothing.

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:41.154
Hello.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:45.959
Excuse me. That bike parked
out front belong to you?

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.955
Yeah.
Did you restore it yourself?

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.170
It needed a little work.
It was nothing.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.005
Where are you from?

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.260
Quebec.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.764
Drive her here all the way
from Canada?

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.261
Yeah.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.013
You must be a good mechanic.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:10.274
Coffee?
Please.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.897
Gonna have anything to eat?
What do you got?

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:18.612
Well, today's special
is meat loaf. It's not bad.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.987
Or you can have
the rest of that guy's steak.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.219
Mookie?

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.851
Clydie,

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:50.227
I thought it might be easier
talking to you on tape,

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.651
but now I'm not so sure.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:58.489
I can never change what I did,
no matter how much I regret it.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.652
Mookie's going to hear lots
of things about me.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.913
Most of them won 't be true.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.200
Please say goodbye to him for me.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:13.918
Tell him I never meant for anyone
to get hurt, especially him.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:09.761
Ah!

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:20.400
Go, go!

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:45.254
Go!

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:58.936
Gather around!
Over there, move! Hiyah!

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.449
- Hiyah!
- Hiyah!

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.690
Shit.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.155
Sixty-four to base.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:56.476
Son of a bitch.

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.773
Get a chopper here now.
I want him trapped.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.276
Mom, what are you doing?
Just locking up.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:47.194
We never lock up.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.447
Well, we're gonna start.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.859
Mommy, are you
scared of something?

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:55.699
Honey, I'm just being cautious.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:59.206
That's different from being scared.
My turn.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.679
Clydie.

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:36.073
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.283
Kentucky Avenue.

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:39.742
Who has that?

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.828
Nobody.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.411
Oh, a six.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.420
Where's...? Where is it?
Where am I?

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:51.091
Ah! Run! Run!

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.002
Go get the kids. Get the kids.

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:55.342
Run!

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:58.553
What do you want?

01:17:59.258 --> 01:18:00.726
My God!

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.349
Argh!

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.233
John, try using the stairs.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:18.865
- Bree, upstairs.
- Open the door, kid.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.657
Open the goddamn door!

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.828
I'll climb out the window,
look for help.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.793
You can't do that. You'll fall.
I've done it before.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:31.207
I'm gonna tell Mom.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.476
Mom.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:44.057
Bree.

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.682
The other little
shit went out the window.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.475
Please don't hurt my children.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.727
Clydie?

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.167
Clydie?

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:20.089
Clydie?

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:25.682
What's the matter?

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:29.352
Lonnie! Ah!

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:34.111
Now, go find the other kid.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.547
I'm over here, you big, fat jerk.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:11.598
Come on out, kid.

01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:17.530
Come on, son. I wouldn't hurt you.

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.051
Shh.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:46.766
Sam.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:48.768
Stay here.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.687
Stupid shit.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.944
I'm gonna kill
that little son of a bitch.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.194
Ugh!

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:12.494
All right, no more threats.
No more bullshit.

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:15.959
You know what we're here for.
I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.964
What are you doing...?
Please.

01:21:18.123 --> 01:21:19.466
Mommy. Mommy.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:23.796
You stay in there and no noise.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:27.466
I'm sick of this town. I'm sick of you.
I wanna go home.

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:30.352
Now, sign the fucking contract.

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:32.559
Here's a pen. Sign the contract.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:35.975
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
Right here.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:39.319
Very good.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.479
Go to hell.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.654
Get out now.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.324
Go. This is my house.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.367
No. We can't leave before the fire.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.248
What?

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:01.170
I'm afraid I can't take the risk.
Al, if you will.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:07.674
Ah! No!

01:22:16.014 --> 01:22:17.311
Watch her. Watch her.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:28.281
Where is he?

01:23:57.491 --> 01:24:00.290
Get up.

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:40.789
Sam. Sam.

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:45.251
Leave him alone. No.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.322
Ah!

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.379
Sam.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.472
You okay?

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.717
Just stay behind me.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.076
Sam!

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:23.432
Au revoir, fucker.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.685
- Clydie.
- Sam.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.773
Don't come any closer.
Let her go.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.737
Don't think of it.
Let her go!

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:38.405
Stay back. Stay back.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.459
Throw the gun down.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.799
Throw the gun down now.

01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:56.469
Throw the gun down.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:59.723
Do it.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.643
Bree?
Mom.

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:05.645
Okay.

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.774
Put your hands above your head.

01:27:09.933 --> 01:27:13.938
I'm Franklin Hale. I own this valley.
Turn around and face the house.

01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:19.326
There's an escaped convict in there.
Turn and face the house. Do it!

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.657
Go. You can still get away.
No.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:27.246
Sam Gillen!

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:31.039
The house is surrounded. Come out
with your hands above your head.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.332
Why do they want you?

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:36.335
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:44.809
A long time ago, I did some things
I was not supposed to do.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.849
Are they gonna take you to jail?
Yes.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:52.188
I don't want you to go.
I've got to go.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.442
I don't want you to.

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:57.064
Good bye, Mookie.

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:02.990
Good bye, Mookie.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:11.746
Goodbye, Bree.
Bye, Sam.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:14.165
Are you coming back?

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:34.272
I'll find a way.

01:28:34.434 --> 01:28:36.732
Somehow I'll find a way
to come back to you.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.859
No matter how long it takes.
We'll be here.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.028
I know.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.254
I love you.

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.172
I love you too.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.613
You saved a lot of lives here.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.776
That ought to count
for something.

01:29:28.905 --> 01:29:30.282
It's okay.

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:56.816
Sam.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:16.460
Goodbye, my friend.

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:19.330
Goodbye, Sam.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.173
Go.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:45.361
You bastard.

01:30:47.067 --> 01:30:48.193
Do you know who I am?

01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:00.626
I know what you are.
