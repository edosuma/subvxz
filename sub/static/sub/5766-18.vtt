WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:07.098
BLAKE (in distance):
It's about Alicia.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.664
That's what you care about
more than anything.

00:11.710 --> 00:14.338
Peter helped you
change your name

00:14.380 --> 00:16.177
at the State's Attorney's Office
when you worked there.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.405
Peter helped you
change your name.

00:18.450 --> 00:21.112
And you slept with him.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.516
You're wrong.

00:23.550 --> 00:26.053
That's good,

00:26.090 --> 00:29.082
because I told the ASA,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.257
and of course, you know,
they have their process.

00:31.290 --> 00:35.226
They'll probably... probably
interview everyone involved,

00:35.260 --> 00:39.094
and they'll get it
all straightened out.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.365
See you around,
Kalinda.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.112
(phone keypad beeping)

01:02.160 --> 01:06.153
(phone ringing)

01:06.200 --> 01:08.191
Hey. What happened?

01:08.230 --> 01:09.367
Did you see Blake?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.095
Yeah.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.132
What did he say?

01:15.600 --> 01:16.862
KaHnda?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.572
Nothing. Just...

01:19.610 --> 01:22.272
Just the usual.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.538
I, um...

01:23.580 --> 01:25.468
Are you all right?

01:25.510 --> 01:28.308
Yeah.

01:28.350 --> 01:29.681
Alicia, where are you?

01:29.720 --> 01:31.688
Home. Why?

01:35.320 --> 01:38.153
Do you want to talk?

01:38.190 --> 01:41.353
No. I'll, um...

01:41.400 --> 01:44.324
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

01:50.410 --> 01:52.401
(phone ringing)

01:55.910 --> 01:58.242
(groans)

01:58.280 --> 02:00.248
Yeah, it's me. What?

02:00.280 --> 02:01.417
Cary?

02:01.450 --> 02:02.917
KaHnda?

02:02.950 --> 02:05.145
What are you doing?

02:05.190 --> 02:07.750
What am I doing?

02:07.790 --> 02:11.180
I'm making an omelet.
What do you think?

02:11.230 --> 02:12.356
Where are you?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.719
I need some help.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.921
Okay. Now?

02:17.970 --> 02:19.790
Did you see Blake today?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.239
Uh...

02:21.270 --> 02:23.238
I mean, no. Why?

02:23.270 --> 02:25.738
He said he was interviewed
by an ASA.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.671
Do you think you might know
who that is?

02:28.710 --> 02:30.268
No.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.538
But I wouldn't worry about it.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.218
Childs doesn't have
a case anymore,

02:33.250 --> 02:35.241
and Blake is AWOL.

02:36.390 --> 02:40.281
Cary, I think Blake
might have something on me.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.323
And I think he might have
told it to an ASA.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.759
Can you find out?

02:44.790 --> 02:48.157
Sure.
What does he have on you?

02:51.770 --> 02:52.930
Can you find out?

02:52.970 --> 02:55.632
Sure.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.661
Thanks. Bye.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.277
So you think he's well?

03:07.320 --> 03:08.912
I believe that,
based upon

03:08.950 --> 03:11.783
a reasonable degree of medical
and psychiatric certainty

03:11.820 --> 03:15.278
that he is no longer in need
of any mental health services,

03:15.320 --> 03:17.356
inpatient or outpatient.

03:17.390 --> 03:21.224
You do know that he tortured,
raped and killed

03:21.260 --> 03:23.296
Mallory Cerone?

03:23.330 --> 03:24.399
I do.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.967
Mr. Bowes was unwell when
he committed that crime

03:27.000 --> 03:28.558
30 years ago.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.307
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity

03:31.340 --> 03:33.934
and committed to a
psychiatric treatment center,

03:33.980 --> 03:35.629
and not to a prison.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.908
Didn't know
you'd be here.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.349
I didn't know
I would, either.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.574
Couldn't stay away.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.282
For 30 years,
he has been treated.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.447
I can say without hesitation,
he is a different man

03:44.490 --> 03:46.754
than the man who
committed that crime.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.883
Oh, you mean, when he did this?

03:50.060 --> 03:51.357
Don't look.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.857
I've seen them before.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.299
You don't understand.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.322
These photos are
indeed horrifying.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.634
But they were committed
by an insane man.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.460
This is the woman

04:02.510 --> 04:03.909
he tortured and killed.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.931
I know.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.279
And did you know her daughter
is in court today?

04:08.310 --> 04:09.846
I did not know that.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.849
I'm sorry-- I know
it's hard to hear,

04:12.880 --> 04:14.541
but justice has
been done here.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.048
The man who killed your mother
no longer exists.

04:17.090 --> 04:20.514
BOWES:
I'm sorry.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.879
I'm very sorry.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.029
He's out in a week.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.025
So now it's up
to you guys.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.037
Keep him from getting rich.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.595
We'll do our best.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.302
Uh, hey. Alicia,

04:38.340 --> 04:41.070
tell Kalinda to stop worrying
about the grand jury.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.907
I'm not finding Blake did
any more interviews,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.599
so there shouldn't be
any more subpoenas.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.945
Okay.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.140
Good to know. I'll tell her.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.080
REPORTER: Are you considering
a divorce, ma'am?

04:51.120 --> 04:52.758
Do you think your husband should
resign his congressional seat?

04:52.790 --> 04:54.018
Please. I need
to get my baby home.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.049
ANCHORMAN:
The congressman's wife

04:55.090 --> 04:55.749
has still offered no comment

04:55.790 --> 04:57.553
after months of revelations

04:57.590 --> 04:58.659
regarding his affair.

04:58.690 --> 04:59.759
MARISSA:
Why are they still in the news?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.950
She should just divorce him
and get it over with.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.467
Then people'll stop chasing her.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.024
This is not good.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.368
Why? It has nothing
to do with you guys.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.766
Everything has to
do with us guys.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.936
Voters are like amoebas.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.437
They suck everything up

05:12.480 --> 05:13.970
and don't distinguish.

05:14.010 --> 05:15.534
Is that what amoebas do?

05:15.580 --> 05:18.048
So that's
the other woman, huh?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.377
She's pretty.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.375
Of course she's pretty.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.945
Now this story will
own the week. You know,

05:22.990 --> 05:24.878
I do have work
to get on with here.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.353
Why does America suck?

05:26.390 --> 05:28.608
America does not suck.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.821
People suck.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.919
What, and you think
Israel will suck any less?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.849
It'll suck different.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.128
So...

05:39.170 --> 05:40.569
That didn't end well, did it?

05:40.600 --> 05:43.728
There was nothing to
end well or not well.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.601
I went for
dinner with her.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.902
That's all.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.976
I was trying to find out
if she was undocumented

05:49.010 --> 05:51.808
when she worked as a nanny
for Wendy Scott-Carr.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.772
And she was.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.038
So it was all
just a political scheme?

05:56.080 --> 05:58.014
It was information-gathering.

05:58.050 --> 05:58.948
Oh, come on, Dad.

05:58.990 --> 06:01.959
I saw your face.
I saw how happy you were.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.527
I have great control
over my face.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.596
I can make people believe...

06:06.630 --> 06:09.098
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Was I boring you?

06:09.130 --> 06:10.768
I have to go study.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.836
Don't misbehave.

06:12.870 --> 06:14.861
Control that face.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.871
(no audio)

06:23.080 --> 06:24.741
LUIS (on TV):
No, it's not her fault.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.578
_ She's been an American
smce she was two years old.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.076
REPORTER: Natalie Flores
has become a flashpoint

06:29.120 --> 06:31.111
for Illinois
illegal alien policy,

06:31.150 --> 06:34.415
which some have decried as
the most lenient in the nation.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.452
(techno pop music blaring)

06:44.200 --> 06:47.658
* Drive on out,
drive on, now drive on out *

06:47.700 --> 06:49.031
* And she makes the noises

06:49.070 --> 06:52.164
* You need to drive on out,
just drive on out *

06:52.210 --> 06:53.177
* The man heard voices

06:53.210 --> 06:58.170
* The girl is alone
in the blink of an eye *

06:58.210 --> 07:00.770
"f You tell her_
to drive, drIve, drive *

07:00.820 --> 07:03.186
* And bitch, don't cry

07:03.220 --> 07:05.017
* The city's too loud...
(volume decreases)

07:05.050 --> 07:07.154
And the lyrics were credited
to him?

07:07.190 --> 07:09.727
To Jarvis Bowes.
Copyright 2010.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.648
The band dedicated
the whole album to him.

07:11.690 --> 07:12.588
How is it doing?

07:12.630 --> 07:15.190
Currently number three
on the Billboard 200.

07:15.230 --> 07:16.094
And monetarily?

07:16.130 --> 07:17.199
Bowes has $800,000

07:17.230 --> 07:19.027
in royalties coming to him,

07:19.070 --> 07:20.594
but it'll go higher.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.868
Still not a lot.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.466
You should hear
from Rhonda.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.909
She isn't interested
In the money.

07:25.940 --> 07:28.033
She just wants to stop
him from getting rich

07:28.080 --> 07:29.672
from a song about
killing her mom.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.201
Yes, I understand her reasoning.
What's ours?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.115
This was one of Bond's cases.

07:34.150 --> 07:37.517
It looks good being on the side
of angels suing a monster.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.142
It'll draw some attention.

07:39.190 --> 07:41.715
So, what, Intentional Infliction
of Emotional Distress?

07:41.760 --> 07:42.886
Worked in a few
other states.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.158
Let's see
if it works here.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.122
He got out?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.525
He's being released
next week.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.491
And we're ready to go?

07:50.530 --> 07:51.895
Bond had all the

07:51.930 --> 07:52.999
"Emotional Distress"
arguments ready.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.861
Okay, but we can't keep carrying
all of Bond's cases.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.208
You're signed off?

07:57.240 --> 07:58.730
I'm signed off.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.977
(clears throat)

08:01.010 --> 08:03.205
Okay, so Bowes's lawyer
will argue

08:03.250 --> 08:04.706
it's his First
Amendment right.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.240
And if they lose that,
they may go after

08:06.280 --> 08:08.248
the song itself;
say it has nothing
to do with the crime.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.315
You want us to make sure

08:09.350 --> 08:11.238
that the song is actually about
the rape and murder?

08:11.290 --> 08:12.882
Yes, whatever
you can get

08:12.920 --> 08:14.751
to connect the imagery
to the crime.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.224
We'll never use it,
but just in case.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.151
Won't this be fun--

08:21.200 --> 08:23.623
finding clues in bad poetry.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.262
* ...drive on out

08:25.300 --> 08:27.495
_ * You need
to drive on out, just-- *

08:29.300 --> 08:31.905
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna comment.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.976
About what?

08:34.010 --> 08:36.740
The Colorado congressman and
his skinny-dipping girlfriend.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.099
That's why you're here, right?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.242
No.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.214
Eli, come on in.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.582
I don't understand.

08:48.620 --> 08:53.592
Her legal fight for citizenship
was complicated by the recent...

08:53.630 --> 08:55.120
situation in the news,

08:55.160 --> 08:58.027
and I don't think her current
lawyer IS qurte up to It.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.994
This is Natalie Flores?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.769
Yes, a De Paul University
student.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.165
Actually, ex-student.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.768
Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny?

09:06.810 --> 09:08.232
Yes.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.202
Ex-nanny.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.172
So, do you mind if I ask?

09:12.210 --> 09:14.917
The rumor is that your campaign
was instrumental in

09:14.950 --> 09:16.349
exposing her
undocumented status.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.611
Yes, well, you know
I can't comment on that.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.254
But this has nothing
to do with the campaign.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.121
This is something
I want handled.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.357
Sure.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.152
I will call her,
and offer our services.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.189
Great. Thank you.

09:30.230 --> 09:31.925
One more thing.

09:31.970 --> 09:34.359
I'd rather it wasn't mentioned
that I had anything

09:34.400 --> 09:35.731
to do with this.

09:35.770 --> 09:36.862
If the press asks.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.207
No, if she asks.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.277
Okay, good to know.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.676
We value _
your busmess, ElI.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.176
You were thinking
about running

09:48.220 --> 09:50.347
for a judgeship
at one point,
weren't you?

09:50.390 --> 09:51.345
I was.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.279
You should think about it again.

10:01.330 --> 10:03.890
* Past the freeway signs

10:03.930 --> 10:06.967
* Past the telephone lines...

10:07.000 --> 10:08.365
Is it perverse?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.163
I'm sort of starting
to like this.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.768
That is perverse.

10:11.810 --> 10:13.402
Do you see
any connections?

10:13.440 --> 10:16.273
Carcass, kitchen sink?

10:16.310 --> 10:18.301
It's all too generic.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.079
Bloody gearshift.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.312
Yeah,

10:22.350 --> 10:24.341
that's one connection.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.359
So Cary checked
to see if there were

10:27.390 --> 10:28.755
any more
interviews with Blake,

10:28.790 --> 10:30.280
and he said
he couldn't find any.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.388
What?

10:31.430 --> 10:32.283
Cary came up to me.

10:32.330 --> 10:33.957
He said, "You should
just stop worrying

10:34.000 --> 10:35.399
about another subpoena."

10:35.430 --> 10:37.125
Okay.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.797
What happened?
Did Blake said something?

10:38.830 --> 10:41.264
No.

10:41.300 --> 10:45.930
You still have that bad feeling:
something bad's gonna happen?

10:45.970 --> 10:47.403
No.
(chuckles)

10:49.210 --> 10:53.214
* Drive on out,
you're gonna drive on out *

10:53.250 --> 10:54.319
Are you happy?

10:54.350 --> 10:56.375
Am I happy?

10:56.420 --> 10:59.981
With your life, your home?

11:00.020 --> 11:01.885
I don't know.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.229
I guess so.

11:04.260 --> 11:07.093
_It's like_when a storm
IS over, IS It happiness,

11:07.130 --> 11:10.429
or it just a relief?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.448
I don't understand.
We want to help you.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.415
We've been seeing
you in the news.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.418
We believe
your case has been mishandled.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.155
Natalie, this is
Alicia Florrick.

11:35.190 --> 11:36.885
Sh_e's worked on other
Immigration cases.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.784
I've asked her
to help here.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.422
We are in a consortium

11:40.460 --> 11:42.997
of law firms who promise
a certain percentage

11:43.030 --> 11:44.429
of pro bono hours

11:44.470 --> 11:46.290
each year, Natalie,
so we offer you

11:46.330 --> 11:47.399
this service free of charge.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.965
Why?
Why?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.433
Because we think
we can help you.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.108
When did your
parents bring you

11:54.140 --> 11:55.937
to the United
States, Miss Flores?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.299
1986.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.499
You were two?

11:58.550 --> 11:59.869
Yes.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.512
The problem we're facing
is this, Natalie.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.484
You know what the Dream Act is?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.408
I do-- it's a path

12:05.450 --> 12:07.987
to citizenship for
people like me.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.487
Yes, but it's political defeat

12:09.520 --> 12:10.680
has made it
paradoxically harder.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.757
Politicians are less willing
to support the undocumented.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.428
Especially someone like you,
with a high profile.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.222
So you're going
to need a sponsor

12:19.270 --> 12:20.965
with three years
of legal residence.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.536
My aunt filed
the I-864 form.

12:22.570 --> 12:23.537
Well, good.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.765
The fact that your case
was already in the works

12:25.810 --> 12:27.402
should keep you out
of any immediate trouble.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.976
And we'll need
you to have a job.

12:29.010 --> 12:30.170
Do you have one at the moment?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.815
I do. Day trading.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.547
Day trading?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.389
Uh, the-the stock market?

12:37.420 --> 12:40.184
Well, currency exchanges, too.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.359
For clients?

12:42.390 --> 12:45.325
A few professors at school.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.191
It's not a lot of money,

12:47.230 --> 12:50.529
_ but _I do offer
a fairly con5|stent 12% return.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.237
Well, I was thinking more
like a nanny job,

12:55.270 --> 12:57.238
but that should work,
I would think.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.807
You're Peter Florrick's wife.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.400
Iam.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.568
Do you know that I used to be
Wendy Scott-Carr's nanny?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.510
I do.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.348
It's kind of odd
how this is working,

13:10.390 --> 13:14.053
me being helped
by your firm.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.081
Yes, it is odd.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.525
Did Eli Gold ask you to do this?

13:19.560 --> 13:20.822
No. Diane did.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.589
So why don't you
give me a call

13:22.630 --> 13:24.518
when you get all your
documentation together?

13:24.570 --> 13:27.437
Am I being used here?

13:27.470 --> 13:31.600
I don't know, but you know what
the best thing to do if you are?

13:31.640 --> 13:32.504
What?

13:32.540 --> 13:34.576
Use them right back.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.102
(elevator bell dings)

13:38.150 --> 13:40.141
Hi, Cary.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.512
Um, can you call me
straight back? Thanks.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.583
Why do you want to know?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.884
(phone chimes)
Why do I want to know
if you're the last one

13:50.930 --> 13:52.488
to interview Blake?
I don't know. I just, uh,

13:52.530 --> 13:54.225
didn't see any interview notes.

13:54.260 --> 13:55.921
Right, 'cause I have them here.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.621
You were out that day,
so I talked to him.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.626
Okay. Anything I should know?

13:59.670 --> 14:02.059
I don't know.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.206
Who asked you to ask?

14:06.240 --> 14:08.333
Do we have a problem here?

14:08.380 --> 14:09.631
I didn't think so.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.307
I'm just wondering why

14:11.350 --> 14:13.477
you're asking me
about a dead case.

14:16.580 --> 14:19.583
Okay. I'm out the door.

14:19.620 --> 14:22.111
You see this is the door,
me and me going.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.128
Sorry, man.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.651
It's a tense place
around here these days.

14:26.690 --> 14:29.523
Yeah, Baghdad after Saddam.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.460
The point is to survive.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.591
It was a lark.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.336
It was our Guns N' Roses moment.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.462
A very lucrative lark.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, well, all the best tracks

14:41.040 --> 14:42.200
are, aren't they?

14:42.240 --> 14:43.639
It's just a goof.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.649
Kind of the new millennium art.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.046
You know? Collage.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.049
Yeah. Collage
from a killer.

14:52.090 --> 14:55.582
Yeah, well, art is art,
isn't it?

14:55.620 --> 14:58.521
Didn't Norman Mailer
kill somebody or something?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.494
So how did you
get the song?

15:00.530 --> 15:02.521
Where are you from, darling?

15:02.560 --> 15:04.528
Nearby. How did
you get the song?

15:04.570 --> 15:07.289
From him. The killer.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.568
What's his name? Jarvis?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.204
Jarvis Bowes.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.573
Yeah, he sent it about a year
ago from his mental hospital.

15:13.610 --> 15:16.602
Love getting submissions
from mental hospitals.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.143
Always open them first.

15:19.180 --> 15:21.068
So what is your accent?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.712
So, he sent
you the lyrics?

15:22.750 --> 15:25.617
No, a tape.
God-awful stuff.

15:25.650 --> 15:26.958
Sounded like a dying porpoise.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.311
Then when I said
I wanted to record it,

15:29.360 --> 15:31.487
he said he wanted
to change some lyrics.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.259
Guy's in a mental hospital.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.155
Suddenly he thinks
he's Ray Davies.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.466
So, uh... you're gonna stay
for the set?

15:40.500 --> 15:44.231
Can I see the tape?

15:44.270 --> 15:48.001
(off-key): * Drive on out
where no one can see *

15:48.040 --> 15:52.147
* You drive on out
under the Christmas tree... *

15:52.180 --> 15:56.469
Christmas tree. That's not
In the newer verSIon.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.978
* Popcorn smell
that won't come off *

16:00.020 --> 16:01.715
* The bloody cow guard...

16:01.760 --> 16:04.228
Popcorn? Bloody cow guard?

16:04.260 --> 16:06.057
I would call that more
than generIc.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.489
* The demons, the noises...

16:07.530 --> 16:08.724
Where you going?

16:08.760 --> 16:12.196
The scene-- see if anything
else in the song connects to it.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.561
(phone ringing)

16:13.600 --> 16:15.067
* Drive on out

16:15.100 --> 16:16.533
* The demons, the noise...
Hello?

16:16.570 --> 16:18.060
(heavy static,
indistinct voice over phone)

16:18.110 --> 16:20.670
Hello. Uh... mm?

16:20.710 --> 16:23.178
Hello? Hello!

16:23.210 --> 16:25.098
(sighs)

16:25.150 --> 16:27.243
Phone your sister.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.771
She's just gonna say,
go with the public defender.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.288
Then maybe we should go
with the public defender.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.413
Just give me one
minute, okay, Dad?

16:38.560 --> 16:41.290
Hi. This is Natalie
Flores for Diane Lockhart.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.423
When will she be in?

16:43.470 --> 16:46.689
It's very important.

16:46.730 --> 16:49.130
No. It has to be today.

16:49.170 --> 16:52.105
Okay. Thanks.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.176
(sighs)

17:00.620 --> 17:01.712
Well, uh, considering

17:01.750 --> 17:05.686
Wendy Scott-Carr has outspent us
by almost two to one,

17:05.720 --> 17:07.779
I'd say, uh,
we were the underdog.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.488
I'm sorry, I have
to take another call.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.781
I'll call you back.

17:15.130 --> 17:18.019
Hello. Hi, this is Eli.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.166
It's me.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.634
Yes, I know.
How are you?

17:23.670 --> 17:26.833
You asked Lockhart/Gardner
to help me?

17:26.870 --> 17:29.134
What?

17:29.180 --> 17:32.206
Eli, you were the one who asked
Lockhart/Gardner to help me.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.844
Yes, but it's not
what you think.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.848
Eli, I need you to call them.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.815
My father has been arrested
and they won't return my calls.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.487
My dad is going to be processed
in an hour.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.451
Which means that his name

17:44.490 --> 17:47.596
is going to be in the system
as undocumented.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.622
Eli, how are you?

17:50.670 --> 17:52.365
Uh, no.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.096
I didn't get the message.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.700
Well, um,
actually, can that wait?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.401
I'm a little bogged down.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.874
No, it can't wait.
I'm sorry.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.844
Diane, you asked me last week

18:03.880 --> 18:05.871
ifI was happy
at Lockhart/Gardner.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.708
I am, but I don't want
to be unhappy.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.115
She needs your help now.

18:11.150 --> 18:13.550
I'm on my way.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.782
(sighs)

18:36.310 --> 18:40.770
* Drive on out
where no one can see *

18:40.820 --> 18:45.109
* You drive on out
under the ChrIstmas tree... *

19:13.980 --> 19:17.814
*

19:28.530 --> 19:29.724
DIANE:
Then what happened?

19:29.760 --> 19:32.399
I received a 2M1 call for a
burglary with forcible entry.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.637
And you saw Mr. Flores
at the scene?

19:34.670 --> 19:35.989
OFFICER:
In the vicinity.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.565
There was a report
of a Hispanic burglar
with a weapon, driving away.

19:38.610 --> 19:41.829
Then I saw Mr. Luis Flores
driving a similar automobile.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.939
A similar make and model?

19:43.980 --> 19:46.676
We're just holding him
for questioning, ma'am.

19:46.710 --> 19:48.940
Yes, unfortunately, in a few
minutes, dispatch will be

19:48.980 --> 19:51.847
sending his name on to
I.C.E. as undocumented.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.653
Well, that's not under
my purview.

19:53.690 --> 19:54.952
I'm investigating
a burglary.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.288
It was a different make
and model, wasn't it?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.685
Ma'am, you can leave
my desk now.

19:59.730 --> 20:00.992
DIANE: _
You saw a HIspanIc man
driving his car

20:01.030 --> 20:03.999
near the burglary scene
and you took him in
for questioning.

20:04.030 --> 20:06.498
Talk to the judge, because I'm
not talking to you anymore.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.964
He is innocent of the burglary,
but he will be deported

20:09.000 --> 20:10.638
if you keep
holding on to him.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.006
Are you all right?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.644
Yes.

20:17.680 --> 20:21.411
You can go now,
if you want.

20:21.450 --> 20:22.610
No, I'm fine.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.982
Whatever this is doing
for you, Mr. Gold,

20:25.020 --> 20:28.012
whatever guilt
this is satisfying,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.449
you don't have to
worry, I'm fine.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.980
OFFICER:
Do you see this, ma'am?

20:32.030 --> 20:33.452
This key?

20:36.500 --> 20:38.661
Mr. Flores is now in the system.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.237
Have a good day.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.637
Yep, one court
after another--

20:46.670 --> 20:48.035
that's my life.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.002
You just behave and
everything will be all right.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.270
You're an artist now.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.874
Babette Penn.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.285
Will Gardner.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.288
I like your suit.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.412
I like yours.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.813
How is it representing
a killer?

21:01.860 --> 21:04.454
You're not going to be
a killjoy, are you?

21:04.490 --> 21:06.458
I might.
I'm not sure yet.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.027
He's really nice
when you get to know him.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.618
(chuckles)

21:12.970 --> 21:14.665
The psycho wants you.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.065
ALICIA:
What do you think?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.534
I think you should go.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.876
Hi.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.913
I'm a fan.

21:27.950 --> 21:28.974
Of?

21:29.020 --> 21:29.941
You.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.084
From way back.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.985
The news conference,
standing by your man.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.079
I wrote a song about it.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.951
How gratifying.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.025
I'll send it to you.

21:39.060 --> 21:40.550
Oh, goody.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.425
Let's_ not make this
borIng, shall we?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.823
What do you suggest?

21:45.870 --> 21:46.825
Tequila shots?

21:46.870 --> 21:49.532
You're funny.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.060
No, I'm punting
on the First Amendment.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.065
Really?

21:52.110 --> 21:53.873
What's the fun in
a Constitutional argument?

21:53.910 --> 21:56.333
You want a quick verdict?
Yeah.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.075
You can bankrupt my client
with appeal after appeal,

21:58.110 --> 22:00.476
and my client's song has nothing
to do with his past crime.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.977
Well, good luck with that.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.410
Just a warning...
Hmm?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.884
I play dirty.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.092
You know, when I said

22:17.130 --> 22:19.667
we'll never use what
you guys are gomg after--

22:19.700 --> 22:20.837
change of plans.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.232
Based on this, Your Honor,

22:29.280 --> 22:32.101
we ask for a summary judgment
of Mr. Gardner's suit.

22:32.150 --> 22:33.742
Just a quick correction
for Ms. Penn, Your Honor.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.940
This suit is not mine.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.119
It is Miss Cerone's, whose
mother was raped and murdered.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.117
PENN: Yes, and unfortunately
for Mr. Gardner,

22:38.150 --> 22:41.085
that case was adjudicated
over 30 years ago.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.712
And we are now in civil court.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.751
Where you are not objecting
on First Amendment grounds.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.395
Because, in the interest of a
quick and tidy summary judgment,

22:47.430 --> 22:49.489
we would argue this suit should
be dismissed on the facts.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.963
Which, we would argue,
should be heard by a jury.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.864
Because you want to inflame

22:51.900 --> 22:52.924
the jury's passions
against my client.

22:52.970 --> 22:55.063
No, Your Honor, because
the facts are persuasive.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.738
As you can see

22:56.770 --> 23:00.399
from these revised
lyrIcs, Your Honor,

23:00.440 --> 23:02.579
Mr. Bowes changed the words
in his song

23:02.610 --> 23:04.874
to avoid similarities
to hIs crIme.

23:04.910 --> 23:07.947
And those changed lyrics
mention an imbedded cow guard,

23:07.980 --> 23:09.948
which you can see in this photo
from the crime scene.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.084
Do you have a minute?
I need to talk to you.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.758
PENN: Really? A cow guard?
That's the connection

23:13.790 --> 23:15.087
Mr. Gardner is making
between my client's song--

23:15.120 --> 23:16.610
The lyrics also make reference

23:16.660 --> 23:17.786
to Christmas trees, Your Honor.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.151
And, as you can see,
from this map and photo,

23:20.190 --> 23:23.125
within a quarter mile
of the crime scene is

23:23.160 --> 23:24.798
the Grayton family
Christmas Farm.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.593
Now, Your Honor,
we would argue

23:26.630 --> 23:27.858
that Ms. Penn's
motion be dismissed

23:27.900 --> 23:29.561
and we continue to trial.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.603
Ms. Penn,
do you have anything?

23:32.640 --> 23:34.505
Your Honor, yes, we do.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.531
The Grayton Christmas Tree Farm
was not in existence

23:36.580 --> 23:38.002
30 years ago.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.814
Is this true, Mr. Gardner?

23:46.090 --> 23:50.527
Your Honor, we would request
a recess to study this.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.949
I checked around on
who last interviewed Blake.

23:52.990 --> 23:54.696
And there were
no InterVIew notes,

23:54.730 --> 23:56.493
so I thought there was
no interview.

23:56.530 --> 23:57.792
But it turns out
there was.

23:57.830 --> 24:00.697
Matan Brody interviewed
him last.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.959
And what did he say?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.659
Matan?
Yeah.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.474
He said he interviewed Blake
last, and he was keeping

24:08.510 --> 24:10.569
the interview notes
under lock and key.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.199
Why?

24:13.250 --> 24:15.241
I don't know. He wouldn't say.

24:15.280 --> 24:19.148
Did he tell you what was in
the interview?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.458
No.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.526
Did you tell Matan
I was the one asking?

24:23.560 --> 24:26.484
No.

24:26.530 --> 24:27.690
Why?

24:27.730 --> 24:30.028
Cary, will you do me a favor?

24:30.060 --> 24:31.664
If you find out anything else,

24:31.700 --> 24:33.930
will you just come talk
to me? No one else.

24:35.170 --> 24:37.832
I talked to Alicia
because she was your lawyer.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.007
I know.
Don't worry,

24:39.040 --> 24:40.974
you're not gonna get
subpoenaed again.

24:41.010 --> 24:43.274
Childs won't come
after you again.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.744
Thanks.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.284
ALICIA:
They're right.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.982
The Christmas tree farm is
only 18 years old.

24:56.020 --> 25:01.026
Okay, we all need to do a bit
of musical archeology here.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.255
What is the connection
between these lyrics

25:03.300 --> 25:04.267
and the crime scene?

25:04.300 --> 25:06.894
And why did he change
those lyrics especially?

25:06.930 --> 25:08.067
Kalinda, where are you on this?

25:08.100 --> 25:10.705
Nowhere.

25:10.740 --> 25:13.777
Great.
Well, let's get somewhere.

25:13.810 --> 25:16.699
Alicia,
call for you.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.775
Thank you.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.912
Hello.

25:22.950 --> 25:24.212
BOWES:
Alicia Florrick?

25:24.250 --> 25:26.810
Uh, yes. Who's this?

25:26.850 --> 25:28.784
You know who this is.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.585
I can tell from your voice
you know who this is.

25:32.630 --> 25:34.723
Is this Mr. Bowes?

25:34.760 --> 25:36.853
Yes. I need a lawyer.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.822
Mr. Bowes,
you have a lavwer.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.792
And we can't be speaking.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.898
I need another lavwer.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.636
There's a Web site that is
dedicated

25:44.670 --> 25:46.069
to illegally downloading
my music.

25:46.110 --> 25:49.136
You can be speaking
if he waives his rights.

25:49.180 --> 25:54.573
And you want another lawyer
to battle illegal downloads?

25:54.620 --> 25:56.770
You're gonna lose tomorrow;
the case will be dismissed;

25:56.820 --> 25:59.744
and then I'll need someone
to sue over Illegal downloads.

25:59.790 --> 26:02.350
Well, I need to remind you that
I work for the firm representing

26:02.390 --> 26:05.359
the adverse party in
your current dispute,

26:05.390 --> 26:07.153
and I can't talk to you

26:07.190 --> 26:08.953
unless you've talked
to your current lawyer.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.321
I already did. She was great.

26:11.370 --> 26:15.238
Why do you stay
with your husband?

26:15.270 --> 26:17.704
I don't know.

26:17.740 --> 26:18.968
Why did you change
your lyrics?

26:19.010 --> 26:19.999
(Bowes laughs)

26:20.040 --> 26:21.200
I'm an artist.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.845
You know,
they did spectrograph studies

26:23.880 --> 26:25.142
of Fra Angelico paintings,

26:25.180 --> 26:27.614
and they found rough sketches
beneath them.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.379
Ah, so you were revising
to improve?

26:29.420 --> 26:32.241
I was revising
because my life is a revision.

26:32.290 --> 26:35.885
And the Christmas tree,
that was just an improvement?

26:35.920 --> 26:37.820
Well, it wasn't
the best rhyme, was it?

26:37.860 --> 26:41.853
I guess I shouldn't talk art
with a lawyer.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.753
It's up to you.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.018
Art is about personalizing,
isn't it?

26:46.870 --> 26:49.896
Lawyers think in terms
of the macro,

26:49.940 --> 26:51.032
artists the micro.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.368
I see. And what's
the micro here?

26:53.410 --> 26:56.231
Ooh. Is this important
for our lawsuit?

26:56.280 --> 26:58.407
_ Our lawsuit
agaInst Illegal downloads?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.701
You decide.

26:59.750 --> 27:02.241
I want to remake my life...

27:02.280 --> 27:03.941
like you have.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.082
How do I do that?

27:05.120 --> 27:06.940
Well, it would
have helped

27:06.990 --> 27:08.309
if you hadn't killed someone.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.420
(laughs)

27:11.460 --> 27:12.950
Oops!

27:12.990 --> 27:14.992
I can't
change the past, can I?

27:15.030 --> 27:17.248
Once a bad person,
always a bad person.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.831
Good-bye.
(click, dial tone)

27:23.370 --> 27:25.361
What do you think?

27:25.410 --> 27:27.207
I think we should be looking
to the personal.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.003
* The popcorn smell

27:29.040 --> 27:31.349
* That won't come off

27:31.380 --> 27:33.200
* The bloody cow guard...

27:33.250 --> 27:34.945
I don't know.

27:34.980 --> 27:37.881
There are new lyrics,
but none of them seem

27:37.920 --> 27:40.047
to connect with
the crIme scene.

27:40.090 --> 27:40.852
We were wondering

27:40.890 --> 27:43.984
if they might connect
to your mom.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.088
I don't think so.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.951
Nothing with the Christmas tree,
popcorn, cow guard?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.353
No, I'm sorry. It was February.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.958
We didn't have a tree up.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.059
And I don't know
what the rest of it means.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.933
* The paper heard voices,
the paper heard voices... *

27:55.970 --> 27:57.198
DIANE:
This is how it'll work.

27:57.240 --> 28:01.074
Your father was swept up in
a hunt-and-peck;

28:01.110 --> 28:05.069
a burglary charge targeting a
Hispanic adult, five-foot ten.

28:05.110 --> 28:06.475
There'll be
a bond hearing tomorrow,

28:06.510 --> 28:08.842
and he's sure
to be released.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.313
The only problem is
he's in the system now.

28:10.350 --> 28:14.309
Immigration has been told
of his identity,

28:14.360 --> 28:16.920
and he's scheduled
to be picked up

28:16.960 --> 28:19.428
along with the other
undocumented at 3:00 pm.

28:19.460 --> 28:21.257
So I need to approach a judge

28:21.300 --> 28:23.393
about accelerating
his bond hearing.

28:23.430 --> 28:28.390
Okay. What can I do?

28:28.440 --> 28:30.431
Be at court tomorrow.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.779
(percussion riff playing)

28:41.820 --> 28:45.517
* Not too far in the trunk
of the car *

28:45.550 --> 28:48.781
* Where no one can hear
her scream... *

28:52.030 --> 28:53.281
Rhonda,hL

28:53.330 --> 28:55.457
Alicia, hi.
Ijust realized I can help.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.821
I was in the elevator,
and Ijust realized...

28:57.870 --> 29:00.020
What?
I'm In a group.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.389
A survivor's group.
We meet every month.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.930
Children whose parents
have been murdered.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.107
There's a woman there:
Lynn Boyle.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.062
Her mother was raped and
murdered in 1981

29:06.110 --> 29:07.099
in Poplar Grove.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.038
They never found the killer.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.035
Are you all right?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.433
Yes. Actually, for the first

29:10.480 --> 29:11.970
time in a long time, I am.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.069
Listen, the things
you said in the song,

29:14.120 --> 29:15.439
they don't sound
like my mom.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.142
They sound like hers.

29:32.130 --> 29:35.190
(muffled, indistinct
conversation)

29:37.840 --> 29:40.434
We always said
we'd never talk about this.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.075
You think I want
to talk about it?

29:44.110 --> 29:46.977
Then why are
we talking about it?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.849
Matan Brody knows.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.087
What're you talking about?
No one knows.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.511
There was another investigator
at Lockhart/Gardner.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.779
He seemed to have found out,
and he told Matan.

30:07.230 --> 30:08.959
Does Alicia know?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.467
No.

30:15.310 --> 30:17.574
It was one night.

30:17.610 --> 30:20.204
There's no way
he could have found out.

30:20.250 --> 30:25.210
You know Matan.
You hired him.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.481
That's why I think
he's not telling Childs.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.317
Childs is a lame duck.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.453
You're saying Matan's wants
to see who wins the election?

30:32.490 --> 30:36.051
My guess is he wants
to be kept on, if you win.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.588
Ah...

30:43.170 --> 30:44.865
Okay.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.263
I'll talk to him.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.839
Kalinda...

30:53.950 --> 30:56.214
You know that I love Alicia.

30:57.920 --> 31:01.287
I've fallen_ in love
WIth my WIfe agaIn.

31:03.460 --> 31:06.156
It would.. kill her
to know this.

31:06.190 --> 31:10.058
I know.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.101
It was another murder.

31:20.140 --> 31:21.402
What?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.135
Rhonda told me
yesterday.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.478
The lyrics in the song
started to make sense to her,

31:25.510 --> 31:27.603
but not about her mom.
Why was your phone off?

31:27.650 --> 31:29.277
What're you talking about?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.514
I tried your cell.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.484
No, no, I mean the song.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.318
Oh. Rhonda is in
a surVIvor group

31:35.360 --> 31:37.555
with the daughter
of a woman named Lynn Boyle.

31:37.590 --> 31:40.388
She was raped and murdered
in Poplar Grove.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.297
She was kidnapped from her
workplace-- a movie theatre.

31:43.330 --> 31:45.662
The popcorn smell?

31:47.170 --> 31:50.196
CARY: Lynn Boyle,
28 years old, mother of two.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.663
She was found
in the trunk of her car.

31:52.710 --> 31:57.272
She was carjacked and forced
to drive off into a field,

31:57.310 --> 31:58.402
where she was
raped and murdered.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.044
No DNA evidence.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.241
Some fabric fibers,
but they never matched.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.986
ALICIA:
When did this happen?

32:05.020 --> 32:07.989
Um... three months
before Malory Cerone.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.955
Did anyone ever try to
connect it to Bowes before?

32:10.990 --> 32:12.582
Yeah, but it
never stuck.

32:12.630 --> 32:16.259
There was nothing of
his at the scene.

32:16.300 --> 32:20.259
Kalinda.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.530
The Christmas tree.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.258
We're cutting it close.
We have 25 minutes.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.130
DIANE: We have
to get the paperwork

32:28.180 --> 32:29.238
to the holding cell, too.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.406
Oh, there he is.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.340
He's here on
another case.

32:32.380 --> 32:35.247
Counselor, do we really have
to belabor the situation?

32:35.280 --> 32:37.009
Take the two weeks, please?

32:37.050 --> 32:38.449
Thank you. Next case.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.981
Your Honor,
we have a quick bond matter

32:41.020 --> 32:42.385
that is time sensitive.

32:42.420 --> 32:45.321
I'm sorry. Is this
Hank Christie?

32:45.360 --> 32:47.248
No, Your Honor, but if you would
allow us a moment,

32:47.290 --> 32:49.099
I have another case
In CIVII court.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.223
Well, that's not
up to me, Ms...

32:51.270 --> 32:52.066
Lockhart.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.694
Ms. Lockhart.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.061
Emily's List, is that right?

32:57.100 --> 32:59.364
It is, Your Honor. Hello.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.763
OFFICER:
I had reason to
believe he was

33:00.810 --> 33:02.471
connected to the crime,
so I pulled him over.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.046
Yeah, but the
report stated

33:04.080 --> 33:05.570
that the burglar
was between the ages

33:05.610 --> 33:07.305
of 18 and 25,
isn't that correct?

33:07.350 --> 33:08.715
Yes.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.672
And how old is Mr. Flores?

33:10.720 --> 33:12.517
Well, he says he's 52.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.484
Officer, I understand
the need to widen the net,

33:17.520 --> 33:20.227
but that would seem
awfully wide, wouldn't it?

33:20.260 --> 33:21.693
Motion for
bond approved.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.129
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.025
And if we could process this
with some haste.

33:36.810 --> 33:40.439
I_ have a release
notIce for LUIS Flores.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.277
NATALIE:
Dad!
Natalia.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.344
That's my client.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.711
He made bond, sir.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.310
He's being transferred
to I.C.E.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.716
No, the judge just
ordered his release.
This is a mistake.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.182
That may be, ma'am,
but it's not our mistake.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.458
No, sir, please.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.128
My father's done nothing wrong.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.390
He's_ never even had
a parkIng tIcket-- please.

33:56.430 --> 33:57.658
_It's not about_
d0Ing wrong, mIss.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.066
He's in the system.
It's out of my hands.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.398
It's not out of your hands.
You know it's not.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.464
That's just not true, ma'am.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.331
(sighs)
Dad.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.258
I'm sorry.

34:07.310 --> 34:08.732
Don't say that.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.372
I'm okay.

34:10.410 --> 34:13.777
ELI:
Hey. Tom.

34:13.810 --> 34:14.845
What's up?

34:14.880 --> 34:17.269
Mr. Gold, how are you?

34:17.320 --> 34:18.446
Good. Good.

34:18.490 --> 34:19.616
Haven't seen you

34:19.650 --> 34:21.208
at the Sheriff's
Association in a while.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.750
Uh, the wife hates those things.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.224
(laughs)
Yeah, the rubber chickens.

34:25.260 --> 34:27.683
(laughs)
So, um,

34:27.730 --> 34:29.527
can you help me out here?

34:29.560 --> 34:31.596
Luis is my gardener.

34:31.630 --> 34:34.235
Ah, I don't know,
Mr. Gold.

34:34.270 --> 34:35.498
It's I.C.E.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.360
It's I.C.E. when
he's out the door.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.800
He could be _a material witness
In an ong0Ing InvestIgatIon.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.331
He could be _a material witness
In an ong0Ing InvestIgatIon.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.438
It's a small gesture.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.471
It would be
appreciated.

34:45.510 --> 34:48.843
You can't find good gardeners
these days, you know?

34:55.190 --> 34:57.385
Let me see what I can do.

35:09.470 --> 35:10.698
I'm okay, mijita.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.628
I'm okay.

35:17.510 --> 35:20.741
I think we were almost
out of favors in there.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.327
So the lyrics have nothing
to do with your crime?

35:32.360 --> 35:33.725
BOWES:
That is correct.

35:33.760 --> 35:37.526
I'm a fan of Elvis Costello
and Gerard Manley Hopkins,

35:37.560 --> 35:39.528
and I just wanted
to try something

35:39.570 --> 35:40.719
that combined their spirits.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.761
Really?

35:42.800 --> 35:45.462
Really.
Did you like the song?

35:45.510 --> 35:47.466
I think
I liked the earlier version.

35:47.510 --> 35:50.331
I hate my first drafts.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.268
Everything's in flux,
don't you think?

35:52.310 --> 35:54.949
Hmm. And so the Christmas tree
YOu mentIon In the song--

35:54.980 --> 35:56.777
the lyrics
you tried to cover up...

35:56.820 --> 35:57.946
PENN:
Objection.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.311
Actually, I'm not sure

35:59.350 --> 36:00.840
if I should object to that
or just laugh.

36:00.890 --> 36:02.357
You want some help with that?

36:02.390 --> 36:04.426
No, I think I've decided.
(laughs)

36:04.460 --> 36:05.757
You two want us all to leave?

36:05.790 --> 36:06.757
WILL:
No, Your Honor.

36:06.790 --> 36:07.927
So the reason

36:07.960 --> 36:09.496
you changed the cow guard
in your song

36:09.530 --> 36:11.225
has nothing to do
with the location of the murder?

36:11.270 --> 36:13.693
That's correct.
But you do remember
seeing the cow guard?

36:13.730 --> 36:17.268
I don't think
I do remember, but, uh,

36:17.300 --> 36:18.506
I'm an intuitive person,

36:18.540 --> 36:20.201
so it's probably
in there someplace.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.379
WILL: And the allusion to
forcing a victim to pull over

36:22.410 --> 36:23.968
beside a field-- why did
you change those lyrics?

36:24.010 --> 36:25.875
I thought it was
melodramatic.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.946
And yet, fairly realistic
given how you killed her.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.448
I've tried
to block those memories.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.380
WILL: So you don't remember
how you killed her.

36:32.420 --> 36:33.944
So the song could be based
on your crime?

36:33.990 --> 36:35.958
Objection. Leading question.

36:35.990 --> 36:36.911
Overruled.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.587
No.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.224
I remember my crime enough

36:41.260 --> 36:43.524
to know that it's
not connected to the song.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.562
Good. So the allusion
to the car trunk--

36:45.600 --> 36:47.591
how was that different
from the crime?

36:47.630 --> 36:50.599
Well, the song describes
how I carried her in the trunk,

36:50.640 --> 36:52.301
which is impossible.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.831
I couldn't have done that
because I don't drive a stick.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.436
WILL:
So you only

36:57.480 --> 36:59.004
put her in the trunk
after you killed her?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.972
Yes, I...

37:08.050 --> 37:10.416
Go on. You were saying.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.519
Your Honor, could we take
a short recess?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.289
You were saying about the trunk.

37:14.330 --> 37:15.854
How you put her in the trunk?

37:15.900 --> 37:17.822
I didn't do that.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.624
Because that doesn't have
anythIng to do WIth thIs crIme.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.558
PENN: : Your Honor,
please, a recess?

37:22.600 --> 37:24.465
JUDGE BREEN:
Ten mInutes.
(gavelbangs)

37:24.510 --> 37:26.705
It's too bad.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.379
You mixed up the victims.

37:40.650 --> 37:41.753
WOMAN (on TV):
...leaving many observers
wondering

37:41.790 --> 37:43.849
whether this new deal will push
the Congressman's wife

37:43.890 --> 37:45.721
even closer to divorce.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.649
The deal for her memoirs
is estimated

37:48.700 --> 37:50.349
at one point three
million dollars.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.719
I say again-- America sucks.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.624
What's wrong with that?

37:53.670 --> 37:55.888
Capitalism at work.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.636
What is it with
you youth today

37:58.670 --> 38:01.537
and your disgust for
everything capitalistic?

38:01.580 --> 38:02.877
You don't think
that's disgusting?

38:02.910 --> 38:04.673
She's selling her pain...

38:04.710 --> 38:05.847
To pay her bills.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.347
It's better
than selling her body.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.517
Actually, I disagree.

38:08.550 --> 38:09.812
Selling her body is at least
more honest.

38:09.850 --> 38:13.718
Oh, how I love
these little chats.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.056
So... I told mom
about your little girlfriend.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.719
Thanks.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.524
She called it
your campaIgn palette cleanser.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.391
You always find
some crush

38:27.430 --> 38:29.830
in the last month
of the campaIgn to fIxate on.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.634
How I love your mom's little
pop psychology one-liners.

38:32.670 --> 38:33.967
She said it's 'cause
you hate yourself.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.399
There we go.
You need_
to act as saVIor

38:36.440 --> 38:39.375
to someone, or you'll have to
face the fact you do bad things.

38:39.410 --> 38:42.641
That doesn't even make sense.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.410
In a sort of_
screwed-up way, It does.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.441
Why are we even talking
about this again?

38:47.490 --> 38:49.879
Can't we just sit
and enjoy quality time?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.558
She was outside.

38:51.590 --> 38:52.727
What?

38:52.760 --> 38:54.899
You asked
why I'm talking about her again.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.522
Because I saw her outside,

38:56.560 --> 38:57.697
and we said hi.

39:00.470 --> 39:01.732
Go to her, Dad.

39:01.770 --> 39:02.737
Go save her.

39:18.550 --> 39:21.041
Uh, hello?

39:21.090 --> 39:23.081
Hi.

39:24.890 --> 39:27.757
I just wanted to say thank you.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.690
That's all.

39:29.730 --> 39:31.618
You didn't need to.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.729
My boyfriend's back
from Las Vegas.

39:33.770 --> 39:35.829
I'm just saying that.
It's...

39:35.870 --> 39:37.792
It's not a big deal.
I'm just saying it.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.831
I'm glad.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.675
I, um...
No, no,
you don't have to...

39:46.710 --> 39:47.847
It's not what
you think. I...
Really.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.542
This is just a thank you.
Natalie, I know.

39:50.580 --> 39:52.514
I know.

39:52.550 --> 39:54.552
It's just nice
to talk, that's all.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.584
I'm too old

39:56.620 --> 39:58.952
to have expectations
of anything other than talk.

39:58.990 --> 40:02.050
(laughs)
Oh, my God, that
sounded terrible.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.091
No. It's okay.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.934
It's really nice talking to you.

40:08.970 --> 40:11.165
And to you.

40:13.670 --> 40:15.672
Good-bye.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.979
Okay.

40:26.850 --> 40:28.852
JUDGE:
Defendant's motion
to dismiss is granted.

40:28.890 --> 40:30.551
(gallery murmuring)

40:33.590 --> 40:35.990
It was always a long shot.

40:36.030 --> 40:37.725
I know.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.762
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

40:39.800 --> 40:40.960
That's okay, buddy.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.729
If there was any way
I could get her back...

40:42.770 --> 40:44.863
Them back.
If there
was any way,

40:44.910 --> 40:46.730
I would.

40:46.770 --> 40:48.237
I know you just
must hate me.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.909
I hope we can
talk sometime.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.874
We have to talk about
those illegal downloads.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.241
Sure, when you get out.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.713
Well, haven't you heard?

40:55.750 --> 40:57.217
I am out.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.548
Yeah, I have heard.

41:00.820 --> 41:05.029
Mr. Bowes, you're under arrest
for the murder of Lynn Boyle.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.687
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:06.730 --> 41:09.494
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

41:09.530 --> 41:10.849
in a court of law.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.822
You have the right
to an attorney.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.634
If you cannot
afford an attorney...

41:15.670 --> 41:17.661
Thank you.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.628
Thank you.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.831
(sighs)

41:24.950 --> 41:26.906
ALICIA:
It's okay.

41:26.950 --> 41:29.646
You guys just play,
and I'll cook.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.148
Mom, it's tied.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.181
Carl, what's wrong with you?!

41:34.220 --> 41:36.017
Well, I kill people,
and I eat their hands.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.209
That's two things.

41:37.260 --> 41:38.284
You have to at least

41:38.320 --> 41:39.287
make references I understand.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.254
Carl!
Dinner is ready!

41:42.300 --> 41:44.621
Mom, it's still tied.
Where's Dad?

41:44.670 --> 41:45.989
Dad, dinner!

41:46.030 --> 41:47.964
No. Ijust want
to make sure.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.888
I'm coming!

41:49.940 --> 41:53.808
Listen, Matan, we've always
worked well together,

41:53.840 --> 41:56.638
so, you be good to me,

41:56.680 --> 41:59.706
and I'll be good to you.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.676
Okay.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.813
Beat Wendy.

42:09.290 --> 42:10.609
I thought you liked it.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.854
I thought you liked
public school.

42:11.890 --> 42:13.152
I do.
I'd stay there.

42:13.190 --> 42:14.054
I just kind of
want to see

42:14.090 --> 42:15.648
what other schools
are out there, you know?

42:15.700 --> 42:17.019
Where would we move to?
I don't know

42:17.060 --> 42:18.220
that we would.
I mean, if we did,

42:18.260 --> 42:19.227
maybe just
to a bigger apartment.

42:19.270 --> 42:20.259
Not back to Highland Park?

42:20.300 --> 42:21.665
Mom doesn't want to.

42:21.700 --> 42:23.190
I didn't say that.
It's expensive.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.266
Isn't the market down?
What, are you followmg
real estate now?

42:26.310 --> 42:28.574
(laughs)
Hey, Dad.

42:28.610 --> 42:30.874
Mom was saying that we might
just stay around here,

42:30.910 --> 42:32.946
and not go back
to Highland Park.

42:32.980 --> 42:33.901
That's right.

42:33.950 --> 42:36.578
Everything good?

42:36.620 --> 42:38.986
As good as it can be.

42:39.020 --> 42:41.818
Want some pizza?

42:41.860 --> 42:44.749
I do.
Pass plates. Oh, wow, you
already took two pieces, dude.
