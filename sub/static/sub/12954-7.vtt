00:01.000 --> 00:02.161
Previously on "Alias":

00:02.235 --> 00:04.499
Sydney, this woman is an assassin.

00:04.571 --> 00:07.768
Vaughn trusted her.
They worked together for seven years.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.810
- Sydney's contact is Renee Rienne.
- Really?

00:10.877 --> 00:14.711
Ms. Rienne has been helping Sydney
with her investigation of Prophet Five.

00:14.781 --> 00:18.217
Michael always told me
I could come to you.

00:19.619 --> 00:20.950
Yeah.

00:21.021 --> 00:25.822
These people killed my fiance -
the father of my child.

00:25.892 --> 00:28.417
Our agreement is whatever I say it is.

00:28.495 --> 00:31.396
I'm the one who got you out of prison.
I can put you back.

00:31.464 --> 00:34.991
- How's your daughter?
- Nadia has nothing to do with this.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.162
Oh, sure she does.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.882 --> 00:50.873
(in Italian)

01:24.484 --> 01:27.612
I'm at the archive.
Your turn now.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.286
Got the key.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.228
It's transmitting now.
Insert key template.

02:13.833 --> 02:17.064
Perfect.
I'm entering the archive.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.647
- I need the lock number.
- So what are we looking for?

02:29.716 --> 02:32.378
All I know is
it's intended for Gordon Dean.

02:32.452 --> 02:36.411
The intel I received said it will be
left for him at the University of Rome

02:36.489 --> 02:39.390
inside a package
shipped to their museum archive.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.949
Howwill we knowwhich package?

02:41.027 --> 02:45.191
It will be sent from Milan
from an alias, Marcello Demasi.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.701
I found the lists.
Give me a moment to find the name.

02:54.407 --> 02:57.968
- Here it is. Marcello Demasi. Num...
- Sydney?

02:58.044 --> 03:03.277
- Sydney Bristow? I don't believe it.
- Professor Choi.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.216
Sydney, I need the lock number.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.551
- Look at you. You look great!
- Thank you.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.249
Sydney.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.554
- What are you doing in Rome?
- Sabbatical.

03:13.626 --> 03:17.858
I'm teaching classes and doing
some research. And what about you?

03:17.931 --> 03:23.164
Oh, I've just been traveling -
1 2 countries in 22 months.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.067
Got it. 1 222.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.902
That's a lot, but I won't
have a chance when the baby's born.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.006
Get out of there
before the Chancellor gets back.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.308
I should let you
get back to your class.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.474
No problem. I'm on a lunch break.
We have plenty of time.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.518
Great.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.923
You know, I don't wanna be
presumptive, but you married?

03:55.635 --> 03:59.071
- Newlyweds.
- Ah. Eager to start a family then.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.437
- I guess you could say we dove right in.
- He must be some guy.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.840
You seem really happy.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.643
He is.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.285
I found the shipment.
I'm retrieving the package.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.019
I'll take that.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.389
Put it down. Step back.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.021
Got it.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.457
I'm on my way to the extraction point.

05:01.534 --> 05:05.470
- So is he here with you, your husband?
- He's at the hotel.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.268
I'd love for you to meet him.
We'll take you to dinner.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.401
- If you'll just write down your number.
- I would like that.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.071
Here, take my card.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.815
It was inside a sculpture.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.384
- Any idea what it's for?
- No.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.690
So, who was that man? Choi?

05:34.767 --> 05:39.204
No one.
He was from another life.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.851
She's still unresponsive.
There's been no change since yesterday.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.395
I'm afraid the Xylenol didn't work.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.990
The drug is still in the experimental stage.
It deserves more time.

06:42.135 --> 06:47.004
Mr. Sloane, we've kept Nadia in
a medically induced coma for five months.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.138
Our procedures haven't shown promise.

06:50.209 --> 06:53.770
When we bring her out, she displays
the same violent propensities.

06:55.915 --> 07:00.079
- These treatments are extremely costly.
- Expense is not an issue.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.713
We've simply run out of options.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.690
At this point, what we try
is unlikely to inspire change.

07:05.758 --> 07:10.218
- It may even do more harm than good.
- I am not prepared to give up.

07:10.296 --> 07:12.992
Neither are we.
In the meantime,

07:13.065 --> 07:17.559
I think you should consider alternative care
in a place a little more comfortable.

07:18.337 --> 07:20.271
OK. Thank you, Doctor.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.667
(phone rings)

07:30.316 --> 07:33.581
- Yes?
- (Dean) How is she doing today?

07:33.653 --> 07:37.885
I feel for you.
I can't imagine how hard it must be

07:37.957 --> 07:40.289
Iooking into the face of your own sins.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.519
What do you want, Dean?

07:41.594 --> 07:44.893
Sydney Bristow has taken
something of mine - an access card.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.367
- I want you to get it back.
- Why? What is it for?

07:49.435 --> 07:54.304
That's none of your concern.
48 hours. Don't let me down.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.575
- Are you sure this is the right move?
- The right move?

08:01.647 --> 08:04.013
- If they find out what you're up to...
- They won't.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.779
Besides, I don't think
I have a choice at this point.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.650
You're being paranoid again.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.179
You're too important
to be dismissed over a few setbacks.

08:12.258 --> 08:17.662
Maybe you're right, but some life insurance
will help me sleep better at night.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.755
You too, I imagine.

08:19.832 --> 08:25.862
Odds are, if they terminate me, they'll
decide our entire cell is a security risk.

08:25.938 --> 08:29.339
I'll let you know when Sloane contacts me.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.223
- Hello, Jack.
- Arvin, good news.

08:49.295 --> 08:53.061
- Sydney's mission in ltaly was a success.
- Yes, I already knew that.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.924
Did you?

08:56.469 --> 08:57.493
How?

08:59.505 --> 09:01.973
Gordon Dean told me.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.373
(# soft rock)

09:40.980 --> 09:43.380
Marshall ran analysis
on the card you retrieved.

09:43.449 --> 09:46.384
He suspects it's an access key
for a secure network.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.250
So we just have to figure out
which network.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.883
Luckily there are only ten billion
secure networks in the world.

09:52.959 --> 09:56.087
We may have a dead end on that,
but we intercepted Dean's property.

09:56.162 --> 09:59.222
- I guess he's not too happy about that.
- (doorbell rings)

09:59.298 --> 10:01.357
I'll take what I can get.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.205
- Delivery for Sydney Bristow.
- Come on in.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.169
Just put it in the nursery,
right through there.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.234
Thanks.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.807
Crib.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.981
You know, the nursery
could use a little work.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.326
I don't know.
I think it's kind of airy.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.929
I'll grab my bag.
We can head in to work.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.231
- I thought you were taking the day off.
- I was.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.295
That was before we had
ten billion secure networks to analyze.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.568
I have a better idea.
Let's set up the crib.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.081
At least that way, we'll know
we got something accomplished today.

10:49.148 --> 10:53.312
- It's OK. I'll do it later.
- What could it take, half an hour?

10:55.454 --> 11:01.359
I used to think that stuff would be so fun.
Decorating a room and picking out colors.

11:05.765 --> 11:08.666
Hasn't turned out
exactly the way I thought it would.

11:10.036 --> 11:11.765
(phone ringing)

11:14.640 --> 11:15.834
Yeah?

11:15.908 --> 11:20.641
I was first contacted a month ago.
It was during my sentencing hearings.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.148
As I told your father,
the terms were simple.

11:24.917 --> 11:28.648
They offered to sway
the Committee's decision for my release

11:30.423 --> 11:32.823
and l, in turn, would be indebted to them.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.190
It was not made clear
what that would entail, but I had an idea.

11:38.998 --> 11:43.025
- You've been lying to us this whole time.
- There's no justification.

11:44.470 --> 11:48.531
However, spending my life in prison
while my daughter was in the hospital, l...

11:48.874 --> 11:52.037
Nadia hasn't improved. Why admit
this to us now? What's changed?

11:53.946 --> 11:56.141
Nadia won't be getting better, Jack.

11:59.585 --> 12:07.185
If I have to face a life without my daughter,
I still have to live with myself.

12:08.828 --> 12:13.060
It sounds hollow, I know,
in light of what I just told you,

12:13.132 --> 12:15.532
but I consider you both to be my family.

12:16.902 --> 12:22.135
- You expect us to forgive you now?
- No, Sydney, not at all.

12:22.208 --> 12:26.645
I know how much pain Dean has
caused you, as well as Rachel Gibson.

12:26.712 --> 12:31.240
I have damaged your investigation enough.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.809
Ironically, Dean's arrangement
puts me in a unique position.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.550
The last thing he expects of me
is to double-cross him.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.422
- You'll help us arrest him?
- Yes.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.485
He's tasked me
to recover something you took -

12:43.562 --> 12:45.996
an access card.
I can use that as bait.

12:46.065 --> 12:50.365
- Understand something. If this is a setup...
- It's not. I assure you.

12:51.637 --> 12:55.903
Once we have Dean in custody, he will
be forced to expose his organization,

12:55.975 --> 12:58.466
and you'll have
all the answers you're looking for.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.544
You have a way to contact Dean?

13:12.024 --> 13:17.519
- (Dean) Hello?
- It's me. I have what you wanted.

13:17.596 --> 13:20.394
Good. I knew I could count on you.

13:22.535 --> 13:27.029
- Where should we meet?
- Get a pen. Write this down.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.532
The meeting place is a racetrack.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.475
Dean may trust Sloane,
but he's still being cautious.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.173
He picked this location because it's safe.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.478
Several exit strategies,
a large crowd to blend in with.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.042
That, or maybe he's got
Lollipop in the second.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.520
We'll have to grab him before he slips out.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.683
That won't be easy. Dean doesn't
go anywhere without security.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.490
It'll most likely be two men,
heavily armed, nearly invisible.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.123
Assume that one will shadow Dean,
the other Sloane.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.690
Sorry. Is anybody else
having deja vu here?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.828
First Sloane was good,
then he's bad, now he's good again?

13:58.904 --> 14:01.737
Although I guess he was bad at first.
I just thought...

14:01.807 --> 14:03.934
We have a tactical disadvantage.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.944
Dean knows what we look like.
He can lD every one of us.

14:07.012 --> 14:11.676
Not every one. He's never seen me.
I look forward to making his acquaintance.

14:11.750 --> 14:15.686
Good. You'll take lead. Dixon,
Sydney, Rachel, you'll provide support.

14:15.754 --> 14:19.315
I want a plan drafted within the hour.
Wheels up at 1 500.

14:19.391 --> 14:22.622
We may not have another chance like this.
Let's make it count.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.746
Dean's reserved you a seat. He won't
arrive until he's confirmed you're alone.

14:43.816 --> 14:49.220
If we give you a transmitter, his security
may detect it, so I'll track you remotely.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.052
- You'll need this.
- It's a facsimile, I assume.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.355
No, it's the real card.
Dean may verify it with a reader.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.952
We'll move in as soon as
we've intercepted his men,

14:58.030 --> 15:00.021
but until then, you'll have to stall.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.464
OK.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.371
I hacked into the closed-circuit feeds.
We're ready.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.531
OK, you're up.

15:08.607 --> 15:13.840
Look, Sydney, I may have lost
the opportunity to save my own child.

15:14.546 --> 15:19.381
I only hope that by taking out Dean,
I will have helped to save yours.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.385
Good luck.

15:27.693 --> 15:32.187
OK. Dixon and Tom are in position.
No sign of Dean yet.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.062
He won't reveal himself
until Sloane is in place.

15:41.740 --> 15:45.232
Excuse me. Mama comin' through.
Watch out. Don't jostle the package.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.744
How y'all doin'?
How y'all doin'?

15:53.819 --> 15:56.117
You gonna help me
pick a winner today, Skinny?

15:56.188 --> 15:59.214
Ha-ha. He's cute for a sheik!

16:19.378 --> 16:23.212
- Excuse me, that's my seat.
- OK, laser mic's on target, Phoenix.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.273
Reception's good.

16:30.589 --> 16:34.582
- Hey, base. You got a visual?
- Affirmative, Sidewinder.

16:34.660 --> 16:39.927
Good, 'cause, uh, I was wondering,
what do you think of this suit?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.559
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice suit on you.

16:42.634 --> 16:46.161
Blue's a good color.
And for you as well, Director Bristow.

16:46.238 --> 16:50.174
Thanks. Oracle, can you get us
a closer look at Sloane?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.145
- How's that?
- Fine.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.315
I got him. The package has arrived.
East concourse.

17:00.386 --> 17:04.652
- There.
- Sloane's in position.

17:07.826 --> 17:11.193
- Sidewinder, we're headed your way.
- Ten-four. Let's do this.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.900
We've got you.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.053
Sidewinder, you're up.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.332
How ya goin', mate?
I'm fantastic, thanks for asking.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.199
You know why? The Tasmanian Devil
is straight as a string.

17:52.271 --> 17:56.002
Gonna make me a rich man.
The thing is, I'm short two grand.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.407
What do you say you front me
and I double it by dark?

17:58.477 --> 17:59.944
Not today.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.503
That watch would get me
two grand across the card.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.381
- We need an assist here.
- This way.

18:07.386 --> 18:09.479
(electrical shock)

18:10.889 --> 18:13.380
First security detail down.
Second one hasn't shown.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.086
This guy's wearing an earpiece.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.027
Dean's communicating via radio.
He could be anywhere.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.396
Until we lD the second detail,
proceed with the meet.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.900
Copy that.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.469
You search crowd.
Someone you know?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.580
Yes, I do.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.041
Lovely day.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.611
Yes, it is.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.780
Outrigger, if Dean follows
his standard protocol,

18:46.859 --> 18:50.192
that second detail shouldn't be
any more than 50 feet away.

18:51.396 --> 18:54.661
- Do you have something for me?
- I do.

19:05.210 --> 19:09.374
Outrigger, I've got him at twelve o'clock.
Blue cap, binoculars.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.473
I'm on it.

19:12.518 --> 19:15.646
Excuse me, sir.
I believe you have my seat.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.518
(electrical shock)

19:17.589 --> 19:20.786
Drinks too much!
Filthy habit.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.631
- Second security detail is down.
- Good work.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.198
Outrigger and Sidewinder, move in.

19:33.272 --> 19:36.764
(static)

19:39.611 --> 19:43.877
It's been a pleasure.
Post One, what's your status?

19:43.949 --> 19:46.474
Outrigger, Sidewinder, move in.

19:48.153 --> 19:52.385
- Post Two, what's your status?
- Oracle, I've lost sight of him.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.755
- Post Two, do you copy?
- Sidewinder, come in! Do you copy?

19:59.831 --> 20:04.393
Their PA is bleeding into our channel.
I'll try to find an open frequency.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.903
- Oracle, do you copy? I've lost...
- Outrigger.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.906
- Phoenix?
- Come in. We've got a problem!

20:10.842 --> 20:13.242
- Stand up.
- Why?

20:13.312 --> 20:17.681
We're gonna take a walk.
Do it now.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.375
Base? Anyone?

20:25.991 --> 20:28.824
- Phoenix!
- Dammit.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.923
You don't need to do this.
I'm telling you, I came by myself.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.764
Just keep going.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.381
Stop!

21:02.027 --> 21:04.461
Well, isn't this a surprise?

21:07.232 --> 21:10.224
What are you doing here, Rachel?

21:14.506 --> 21:17.600
You gonna fight me?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.043
Why do you think
we never put you in the field?

21:22.114 --> 21:26.073
- We knew you weren't equipped.
- Well, then...

21:26.151 --> 21:28.278
That was your loss.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.722
Oracle, come in.
Do you have a visual?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.462
Yeah, actually, on Dean.

21:44.536 --> 21:47.596
- What's he doing?
- Eating dirt. I just hit him with a shovel.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.436
Is he conscious?

21:49.508 --> 21:52.272
- Yeah, I think so.
- Then hit him again.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.368
- We got Dean.
- That's good.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.775
- What happens now?
- He tells us everything,

22:28.847 --> 22:31.611
and we get the truth about Prophet Five.

22:50.135 --> 22:53.332
You seem very pleased with yourself.

22:53.905 --> 22:57.898
I'll keep this simple.
We have a few questions for you.

22:57.976 --> 23:01.173
We want to know who you're working for
and what their agenda is.

23:01.246 --> 23:06.013
The only other question is whether
you'll cooperate willingly or unwillingly.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.917
The ironic thing is, Ms. Bristow,

23:08.987 --> 23:13.583
you and I may not share the same agenda,
but we have the same goal.

23:13.658 --> 23:16.422
I want to know who I'm working for
as much as you do.

23:16.495 --> 23:21.194
Unfortunately for both of us,
you robbed me of that opportunity.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.727
- The access card.
- You were making a power play.

23:26.805 --> 23:31.333
The people I answer to - their power stems
from remaining anonymous.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.901
I was hoping to balance the playing field.

23:33.979 --> 23:36.277
All the information you want
can be accessed

23:36.348 --> 23:39.181
off a communication hub using that card.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.220
But before I tell you the location,

23:42.287 --> 23:44.721
you have to agree to
do something for me.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.782
Andwhatisthat?

23:47.859 --> 23:50.726
I want ten million dollars,

23:50.796 --> 23:54.357
as well as documents to authenticate
half a dozen false identities

23:54.433 --> 23:58.665
and dental implants capable of
fooling facial-recognition software.

23:58.737 --> 24:03.436
In short, you're going to
make me disappear.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.506
- Not a chance.
- I wouldn't be so hasty.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.776
That access card will expire
in just under 1 2 hours,

24:10.849 --> 24:15.548
at which point the information will vanish
and I can no longer help you.

24:15.620 --> 24:22.549
So I suggest you talk to the people you
answer to and share with them my offer.

24:23.395 --> 24:26.057
I don't need to.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.123
I don't think it's gonna take that long.

24:44.015 --> 24:47.178
- What is it?
- LSD. Well, sort of.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.852
I started with a lysergic acid
diethylamide-based serum

24:50.922 --> 24:54.153
and, you know, Flinkmanized it.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.990
Of course, he won't see
any dancing bears on this trip,

24:57.062 --> 25:01.624
I promise you that. Not that... I mean,
I heard about it from a guy once.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.294
I've never...
Hey, Mr. Bristow.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.360
- How long till we interrogate?
- Not long.

25:06.438 --> 25:10.067
In an hour, he'll think you're God.
He'll tell you anything you wanna know.

25:10.141 --> 25:13.702
Of course, if you'd like,
I could facilitate the process.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.769
Let's do that.

Peaceful, hm?

25:53.351 --> 25:56.377
- Yeah, it is.
- Hm.

25:56.454 --> 26:00.481
I imagine you're having quite a difficult day.
Am I right?

26:02.661 --> 26:08.759
- Excuse me. Do I know you?
- Nope, you don't know me, Mr. Sloane.

26:09.968 --> 26:15.463
But I do have one small favor to ask of you.

26:15.540 --> 26:19.067
My associates and I are aware of
your adventure in Dubai.

26:19.144 --> 26:24.172
We also know that Gordon Dean
is still in custody, presumably at APO.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.513
We need you to eliminate him.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.519
- Eliminate him?
- Yes.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.546
We are confident you'll overcome
any obstacles that stand in your way.

26:32.624 --> 26:35.923
I see.
You can go to hell.

26:37.095 --> 26:41.464
I've confessed my bargain with Mr. Dean.
You no longer have any power over me.

26:41.533 --> 26:45.594
That may be.
But we do still have plenty to offer.

26:45.670 --> 26:49.265
I doubt there's anything
that you could do for me.

Uh, you should answer that.

Yeah.

27:07.258 --> 27:09.021
My God.

27:16.234 --> 27:19.829
- What did you do?
- Nothing. It just happened.

27:19.904 --> 27:24.000
The nurse came through on rounds
1 5 minutes ago and found her awake.

- Cut it.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.578
You know, I think I gave him
too much diophorazide. My bad.

28:04.649 --> 28:08.847

No, his body can't withstand more drugs.

28:15.093 --> 28:19.621

They want my eyes.
Don't let them take my eyes.

No, I won't.
No one can hurt you as long as I'm here.

it was designed to patch into

Tell me which one.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.738

I can help you.

You need to go to the roof.

30:23.288 --> 30:27.657
OK. Which roof?
Where do I find it?

30:30.061 --> 30:33.519
- Glenheim.
- OK, what is Glenheim?

30:33.598 --> 30:37.796
There's a Glenheim Corporation
in Seattle. The Glenheim Towers.

30:37.869 --> 30:41.430
- Pull up the building schematics.
- I'll pull up the building schematics.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.373
There's a satellite on the roof
connected to the servers.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.934
We need a plane fueled and ready
to leave for Seattle in an hour.

When?

30:53.218 --> 30:55.049
(sobbing)

31:02.894 --> 31:05.419
I shouldn't have done it.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.590
I didn't mean to.

31:08.666 --> 31:09.963
They insisted.

31:11.302 --> 31:16.501
- You didn't want to do what?
- They insisted to k-kill Michael Vaughn.

31:19.777 --> 31:22.974
I can help you defeat them,
but you have to hurry.

31:23.047 --> 31:27.746
- They have plans for you.
- What plans?

31:31.422 --> 31:34.516

- I'll tell you about it in time.

Just rest for now.

- What is it?

32:01.619 --> 32:05.453
- Where's the doctor?
- Just stepped out for a minute.

Oh, God.
Please! I need help here!

32:12.230 --> 32:16.792
Please! Help! I need help here! Doctor!

32:16.868 --> 32:19.894
Help me hold her down.
I need you to step back, Mr. Sloane.

32:19.971 --> 32:23.031
- Nadia! Please!
- Blood pressure 70 over 50.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.668
I need 500 milligrams of Detropine lV.

33:00.078 --> 33:02.478
We were forced to induce coma again.

33:02.547 --> 33:09.009
Look, I'll be honest. Waking up without any
signs of her disease was, frankly, a fluke.

33:09.087 --> 33:13.353
Without an explanation,
it's likely this is never gonna happen again.

33:14.425 --> 33:18.259
Of course, we'll watch her closely.

33:18.329 --> 33:21.025
Thank you, Doctor.

33:30.641 --> 33:36.273
You've done everything you can for her.
Beyond that, it's out of your control.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.542
Thank you, Sydney.

34:02.940 --> 34:07.240
- This is Outrigger. We've touched down.
- Copy that.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.302
- I heard. Are you OK?
- Yeah.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.178
- How's Sloane?
- Not well.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.396
We figured out what Dean meant.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.195
- The network is mobile.
- Meaning?

34:30.268 --> 34:33.567
Their communications are piggybacked
through telecom satellites.

34:33.638 --> 34:36.902
The Glenheim people don't know
they're being used, which is the point.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.841
They wouldn't know the network was there.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.902
The network is rerouted
every few days as a precaution.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.072
If we lose them now,
we won't find them again.

34:45.149 --> 34:48.208
- How much time do we have?
- 1 2 minutes, 58 seconds.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.744
- Sidewinder, your status?
- We're at the dish, cutting through now.

34:51.822 --> 34:55.782
Great. When you open up the panel.
Iet me know what you're looking at.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.761
I'm looking at a keypad
and an LCD readout.

34:58.830 --> 35:02.789
- OK. um. any access ports?
- Affirmative.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.700
- Uplink should be coming your way.
- Got it.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.738
- What are we looking at?
- Not sure.

35:07.805 --> 35:10.865
It looks like the network's
not tracking back to just one source.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.933
- Meaning?
- When I try to locate the origin,

35:13.010 --> 35:14.671
several addresses keep popping up.

35:14.745 --> 35:18.374
It looks like the information's being
fed by a number...

35:18.449 --> 35:22.579
Wait a minute. That is weird.
One node streams to Credit Marquis!

35:22.653 --> 35:24.780
- What's that?
- French lntelligence.

35:24.856 --> 35:28.485
There's a stream to Russian SVR,
a European pharmaceutical conglomerate,

35:28.559 --> 35:31.460
the CDC, Ml-6.
This list goes on.

35:31.529 --> 35:35.124
- They're hijacking government servers?
- No, I'd be able to detect it.

35:35.199 --> 35:38.965
I mean, this suggests...
they are government.

35:39.770 --> 35:43.763
Dad? Gordon Dean didn't bribe someone
on the inside to get Sloane out of jail.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.776
His organization is already on the inside.

35:46.844 --> 35:50.473
- Marshall, can you trace those nodes?
- Yeah, let me see what I can do.

35:56.521 --> 36:00.218
Right on time.
Network diagnostic is up and running.

36:02.560 --> 36:07.827
You got two minutes to grab that coffee.
Oh, and get me a cup, too? Little cream.

36:15.606 --> 36:16.595
Arvin.

36:16.674 --> 36:21.168
- For a minute, no one knows I'm here.
- Good. Get me out of these.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.178
That isn't exactly what I had in mind.

36:26.684 --> 36:31.178
OK, I've narrowed it down to 1 2 isolated
nodes. I can trace their point of origin.

36:31.255 --> 36:32.779
- Twelve?
- Yeah.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.417
If there was never a one,
there was another twelve.

36:35.493 --> 36:38.018
In the Caymans, that was
one of Dean's account protocols.

36:38.095 --> 36:40.188
- Oh.
- What just happened?

36:40.264 --> 36:43.722
We're locked out.
Let me try to bypass the encryption.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.194
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

36:46.270 --> 36:48.966
Grade-three Watchman encryption.
No way around this.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.907
- It's requesting an access code.
- Dean mentioned Watchman.

36:51.976 --> 36:55.810
When I find the Watchman, he would help.
He has the access code.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.677
Go.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.744
Don't do this.
I have the access code!

37:00.818 --> 37:05.619
- You can take down Prophet Five!
- God forgive me.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.488
Help! Somebody, please!

37:13.564 --> 37:17.000
These walls are soundproof.
There's no point in shouting.

37:42.627 --> 37:45.619
According to medical services,
Dean took his own life,

37:46.697 --> 37:51.532
apparently with a cyanide pill he had
subdermally implanted inside his cheek.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.163
I don't understand.

37:55.239 --> 37:58.265
This morning he wanted immunity.
He wanted to live.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.901
Clearly, Dean thrived on power.

38:01.979 --> 38:05.881
Once the drug wore off, he must've
realized he was facing a life sentence.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.214
Death was easier to accept.

38:08.286 --> 38:13.690
Marshall counted 1 2 sources
that make up Prophet Five. 1 2, Dad.

38:13.758 --> 38:17.250
- It's like the Alliance all over again.
- I know.

38:17.328 --> 38:21.731
If they are embedded inside global
government, where do we even start?

38:21.799 --> 38:23.767
We've already started.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.870
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

38:33.511 --> 38:37.845
- Do you have any plans for tonight?
- What did you have in mind?

38:42.820 --> 38:47.450
You're sure you won't join me?
We can drink to your success.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.860
Or, perhaps, if you like...

38:51.929 --> 38:53.988
to soothe your guilt.

38:56.300 --> 39:00.293
- Guilt isn't one of my driving emotions.
- To your success, then.

39:02.306 --> 39:06.037
As we agreed,
Dean's operation is now yours.

39:06.110 --> 39:10.308
But with one warning:
I appreciate ambition,

39:11.782 --> 39:14.842
but if you're considering
any further betrayals,

39:14.919 --> 39:18.878
they will come at your own expense.

39:18.956 --> 39:21.447
I understand.

39:31.902 --> 39:33.995
I'll be right back.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.711
A job well done, Mr. Sloane.
I'm so glad you took our offer.

39:45.783 --> 39:49.844
- I didn't have much of a choice, did l?
- There's always a choice.

39:52.323 --> 39:57.260
- My daughter... when will she be cured?
- Soon.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.491
Soon?
Perhaps you could be a bit more specific.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.694
I wish I could, but there are a few more
things we need you to do first.

40:04.769 --> 40:09.536
- We have a deal.
- No. We have an arrangement,

40:09.607 --> 40:12.167
which you don't seem to
understand very well.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.440
- You son of a bitch.
- We'll be in touch.

40:16.547 --> 40:19.880
Till then,
I want you to remember one thing -

40:19.950 --> 40:22.714
you have something now
that you didn't have this morning.

40:22.787 --> 40:26.245
- What's that?
- Hope.

40:40.538 --> 40:44.099
{# "Your Song" by Elton John)

40:47.945 --> 40:51.312
- OK, that's the headboard.
- That's the footboard.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.213
Mm-hm. That's what I said.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.480
Have you ever actually
built anything before?

40:57.555 --> 41:01.616
- Yes, in fact. I built your crib.
- Really?

41:03.360 --> 41:05.954
Well, your mother and I did it together.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.768
- Done.
- Done?

41:13.838 --> 41:16.398
Mm-hmm. Why?
Did you doubt me?

41:17.475 --> 41:20.342
No, of course not.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.085
(thud)

41:39.797 --> 41:42.265
Get me the screwdriver.

42:25.276 --> 42:27.039
(children) Bad robot!

42:28.305 --> 42:34.327
