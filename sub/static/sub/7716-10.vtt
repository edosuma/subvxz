WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:04.923
Christmas time is here!

00:05.006 --> 00:07.592
Wow! Thanks, guys.
That sounded amazing.

00:07.967 --> 00:12.931
Hi, I'm Andy Bernard, and I am
the first office Santa ever

00:13.139 --> 00:15.141
to make holiday
wishes come true.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.435
Who's excited to get
their holiday wishes?

00:17.769 --> 00:20.105
Holiday wishes.
What's that, Stanley?

00:20.522 --> 00:23.066
We know exactly what holiday
you're referring to.

00:23.692 --> 00:27.862
It is important to be mindful of all
belief systems at our holiday party.

00:28.238 --> 00:30.323
I've been here 18 years,
and I've suffered

00:30.448 --> 00:32.575
through some weird
thematic Christmases.

00:32.867 --> 00:36.079
A Honolulu Christmas,
a Pulp Fiction Christmas,

00:36.162 --> 00:39.207
a Muslim Christmas,
Moroccan Christmas,

00:39.290 --> 00:41.000
Mo Rocca Christmas

00:41.126 --> 00:42.168
I don't want it.

00:42.252 --> 00:44.754
Christmas is Christmas
is Christmas is Christmas.

00:44.838 --> 00:48.049
I got Stanley tickets to see
Lewis Black for his birthday.

00:49.384 --> 00:51.553
Might not have
been the best idea.

00:52.429 --> 00:53.888
I don't want no
Kwanzaa wreath.

00:53.972 --> 00:56.641
I don't need a dreidel in my face.
That's its own thing.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.560
And who's that
black Santa for?

00:58.810 --> 00:59.811
I don't care.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.939
I know Santa ain't black.
I could care less.

01:03.398 --> 01:06.025
I want Christmas.
Just give me plain

01:06.109 --> 01:08.820
baby-Jesus-lying-in-a-manger
Christmas.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.625
What is the status on my wish?
Fulfilled.

01:22.709 --> 01:25.670
Brought my bicycle so I can be
your designated driver later,

01:25.754 --> 01:29.299
in the event that you drink too much,
which is by no means required.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.384
What about my wish that we
don't have to attend meetings

01:31.468 --> 01:33.136
that degrade our
sense of adulthood?

01:33.219 --> 01:34.387
That, I cannot do.

01:34.471 --> 01:37.182
But I did get you an acre
of property on the moon.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.517
Where, dark side
or light side?

01:39.976 --> 01:42.061
Light side. Is it by the
Sea of Tranquillity?

01:42.645 --> 01:44.606
As a matter of fact, yes.
Directly adjacent.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.317
Beachfront.
Thank you, Andy.

01:47.567 --> 01:50.361
So whose wish is next?
What about Santa's wish?

01:51.070 --> 01:54.532
My biggest wish is that you all
get along well with Jessica.

01:57.577 --> 01:59.037
Come on, guys, Jessica.

02:00.038 --> 02:01.331
Jim, tell them who Jessica is.

02:01.915 --> 02:03.082
She's not your grandmother,
is she?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.001
Gam-Gam's
name is Ruth, Jim.

02:05.084 --> 02:08.296
You should know. I introduced
you on speakerphone that time.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.507
Jessica is my super
serious girlfriend,

02:10.590 --> 02:13.218
who is seriously awesome
and seriously sexy.

02:13.885 --> 02:16.304
Only thing that's not serious,
by the way, our repartee.

02:16.429 --> 02:18.473
That's great.
When you know, you know.

02:18.556 --> 02:19.974
Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?

02:20.058 --> 02:21.851
Totally out of your league.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.187
So, in summation, ho ho ho,

02:24.270 --> 02:25.980
please be nice to Jessica,
and mistletoe

02:26.105 --> 02:27.816
is not an excuse
for sexual assault.

02:27.899 --> 02:29.734
And don't go near Gam-Gam.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.656
I love Jessica, and I
haven't even met her yet.

02:34.739 --> 02:37.200
It's like, we don't
even need to meet, you know?

02:37.283 --> 02:39.327
I already love you. Stay home.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.914
I just want you to
know that I will be mean

02:43.039 --> 02:44.165
to Jessica,
if you want me to be.

02:44.249 --> 02:45.542
Oh, no, no, it's fine, Kelly.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.002
It's really no problem. I was already
planning on being mean to her.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.295
That's okay,
I don't want you to do that.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.464
Hello.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.300
Merry Christmas, Erin.

02:54.467 --> 02:57.011
Kelly, happy Pancha Ganapati.

02:57.095 --> 02:58.137
Ew. What is that?

02:58.221 --> 03:00.974
The five day Hindu
celebration in December,

03:01.099 --> 03:03.893
honoring the god Ganesh,
patron of the arts.

03:04.686 --> 03:05.687
Cool.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.397
Hey, man.
Hey.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.107
How you holding up?

03:10.066 --> 03:11.860
Because of your
wife leaving you.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.111
Kevin.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.697
I actually appreciate
the human intimacy.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.032
I feel like a kitten
being cradled by a gorilla.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.158
Yeah.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.995
It's been 10 days since I
had sexual intercourse.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.622
Well, you came to the right place.

03:25.123 --> 03:27.417
It... This party
will cheer you right up.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.461
I hope so. The corporate
party was wretched.

03:30.545 --> 03:34.215
I am so tired of
the Black Eyed Peas.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.384
It's rock and roll for people
who don't like rock and roll.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.803
It's rap for people
who don't like rap.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.472
It's pop for people
who don't like pop.

03:42.473 --> 03:43.474
Ah.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.226
Heartbreaking.

03:45.435 --> 03:46.436
Oh. Thank you.

03:48.771 --> 03:55.612
Well, I hate to have to take my Santa
hat off and put on my hard ass hat,

03:55.904 --> 03:58.907
but this is serious.

03:59.532 --> 04:02.744
It's come to my attention that
somebody who shall remain nameless

04:02.827 --> 04:04.704
wants to switch desk clumps.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.540
Fine with me. Jim can
leave any time he wants.

04:07.624 --> 04:08.791
Good-bye.
Wasn't me.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.209
It wasn't either of you.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.878
Cathy wants to
leave our clump?

04:12.837 --> 04:15.924
Don't look.
Who it was is not important.

04:16.341 --> 04:18.593
But she did say that
your constant pranking

04:18.718 --> 04:21.012
and one-upsmanship
is driving her crazy.

04:21.220 --> 04:24.182
She or he. I just want to
say this is not my fault.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.476
Okay, the weak
always bully the strong,

04:26.559 --> 04:28.186
contrary to what
you see in the media.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.396
I am always
acting in self-defense.

04:30.813 --> 04:32.732
Occasionally
preemptive self-defense.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.401
Ow! What are you doing?
Hey! Hey!

04:35.485 --> 04:36.819
Respect the hat.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.988
Pam never seemed
to have a problem with us.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.825
All right. I'm gonna speak in a
language you both understand.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.452
Moe-nay.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.537
What was it?
What is it?

04:47.038 --> 04:48.039
Money.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.876
You both have sizable Christmas
bonuses coming your way.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.461
If I catch either of you
messing with the other,

04:53.544 --> 04:55.672
I will give both
bonuses to the other person.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.299
Can't do that.
No, absolutely not.

04:58.383 --> 05:02.136
You need consequences. Okay, I want
you both walking on eggshells.

05:05.598 --> 05:08.393
Hi, I'm Jessica.
I'm looking for Andy.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.980
Jessica, yes.
We don't say hi. We hug.

05:14.941 --> 05:17.402
I'm Erin. Sorry.
Ooh!

05:17.568 --> 05:19.237
I hope you feel really welcome.
We all want you here.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.363
Oh.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.074
My ex is meeting my sex.

05:24.409 --> 05:25.785
Which is always scary.

05:26.035 --> 05:29.622
You know? And not just because you think
they might talk about your penis.

05:30.456 --> 05:31.874
That's just part of it.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.043
Hey! Jess, Erin.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.628
I hope you're not
talking about my penis.

05:35.753 --> 05:36.879
Hi.
Hi.

05:37.005 --> 05:39.924
Hey, everyone,
I want you to meet Jessica.

05:40.425 --> 05:43.094
She is an assistant cross-country
coach at Bryn Mawr.

05:43.428 --> 05:44.429
Wow.

05:44.554 --> 05:47.473
Erin, by the way,
amazing receptionist.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.518
Oh, that's great.
Backbone of the office.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.603
Which is funny, actually,
because my spine is a mess.

05:52.687 --> 05:53.730
What?
Oh.

05:53.813 --> 05:57.984
Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace
for three years, but I never did.

06:00.987 --> 06:02.780
Oh, no.

06:03.156 --> 06:04.824
Oh, no, it's kicking in.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.994
Spontaneous scoliosis.

06:11.039 --> 06:12.040
Oh.

06:12.123 --> 06:14.459
This thing could take your
arm off, your head off.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.877
You know,
just exercise caution.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.086
Thank you.
All right.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.504
All right.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.882
Oh, yeah,

06:21.132 --> 06:23.760
and there's a Christmas party upstairs
tonight I wanted to tell you about.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.553
Isn't that just
for popsicles?

06:25.887 --> 06:26.888
Popsicles?

06:26.971 --> 06:29.390
Yeah, like, upstairs people. 'Cause
you got a stick up your butt.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.852
Ah. See, I thought it was
because they're all so rich

06:32.935 --> 06:35.229
they could eat popsicles all the time.

06:35.313 --> 06:37.482
What?
I... In my...

06:37.565 --> 06:40.026
Well, you should definitely come.
The foreman always comes.

06:40.318 --> 06:43.362
Plus it's fun, you know,
cookies, smoked fish,

06:43.738 --> 06:45.364
alcohol, people acting stupid.

06:45.490 --> 06:48.701
You had me at "clookies." I can't
wait to find out what they are.

06:50.161 --> 06:51.120
What should I wear?

06:51.204 --> 06:53.581
Oh, it's nice. It's real nice.
People get dressed up.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.501
I will look so
handsome for you, Darryl.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.469
Uh...

07:08.679 --> 07:09.847
I'm gonna...

07:14.852 --> 07:16.854
Dwight really wants my bonus.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.357
He's trying to entrap me.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.860
Oh, God, now I can't
drink at this thing.

07:25.113 --> 07:27.115
I get really
pranky when I drink.

07:27.782 --> 07:29.283
Erin, what can I get for you?

07:29.367 --> 07:32.036
Do you have cola?
Kirkland, if you have it.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.996
Why would you come to a bar
and ask for a cola

07:34.080 --> 07:35.998
when you can get
some from the kitchen?

07:36.707 --> 07:39.502
Did some small part of you want
something a little stronger?

07:40.545 --> 07:44.382
Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar,
come and take these shots.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.800
Yes!

07:46.050 --> 07:47.051
Will do.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.721
The fifth one is for you, Erin.
You can take it or leave it.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.558
To take it would be
to accept that you're

07:53.683 --> 07:55.518
at a party,
and you're an adult woman

07:56.227 --> 07:58.521
and you have
an adventurous spirit.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.189
To leave it
would be fine, too.

08:00.273 --> 08:02.567
One, two, three.
Yes.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.901
Okay.

08:04.902 --> 08:05.903
Wow!

08:06.362 --> 08:07.572
Whoo!
Hey, hey, nice.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.991
Jiminy Christmas!

08:10.449 --> 08:12.118
Jiminy Christmas, indeed.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.579
Hit her up.
Oh, yes.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.581
- Yeah.
- Wow!

08:19.625 --> 08:21.711
Yeah, I just got my
replacement credit card.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.924
Do you want the number?
Oh, it's 4-7-9-3

08:27.425 --> 08:31.846
O-O-3-2-3-3-1-3.

08:32.972 --> 08:36.434
The security code is 9-2-7.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.436
Okay, great,
thank you very much.

08:38.728 --> 08:39.937
Bye.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.443
So Dwight did take the bait.

08:46.861 --> 08:51.407
He used my credit card numbers to
send a $200 bouquet of flowers

08:52.325 --> 08:53.701
to my wife.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.161
From me.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.709
Boom!

09:02.752 --> 09:04.962
Look, it's
Christmas, so you're allowed...

09:05.880 --> 09:06.881
Hello.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.558
I meant dressed up
compared to normal.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.477
You usually dress
like a Ghostbuster.

09:19.769 --> 09:21.520
Okay. I thought you'd
wear a sweater.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.272
Since when does a sweater
mean "dressed up"?

09:23.356 --> 09:24.357
Am I your grandson?

09:24.482 --> 09:25.483
Come on, stay, all right?

09:25.566 --> 09:26.943
It's good for people
to get to know you.

09:27.443 --> 09:30.112
As a contestant on
Dancing with the Stars maybe.

09:30.863 --> 09:35.326
I want my sugar-free cookie, and
then I want a sugar cookie.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.662
And then I want my nap.

09:37.787 --> 09:39.247
That's right.

09:39.497 --> 09:41.332
Thank you.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.125
She is remarkable.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.628
Edgy impressions.
Thank you.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.672
How many drinks
have you had tonight?

09:47.797 --> 09:49.298
I can't be
driving everybody home.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.425
A thousand.
Woah!

09:52.051 --> 09:54.011
Maybe you should take a break.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.555
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

09:58.099 --> 09:59.684
Just kidding.

10:03.396 --> 10:04.981
Ah! I've been attacked!

10:05.064 --> 10:08.150
Oh, my God. Someone put a
porcupine in my drawer.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.610
Oh, my God.

10:09.694 --> 10:12.863
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my
desk, and I reached into my drawer

10:12.947 --> 10:15.241
to grab my toothbrush
and some tooth powder,

10:15.366 --> 10:17.451
and all of a sudden,
I was attacked

10:17.576 --> 10:19.704
by this bloodthirsty
rabid creature.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.374
I wonder, in this office,
who has access to a porcupine?

10:23.582 --> 10:26.711
Or who in this office
knows that I have access

10:26.836 --> 10:28.629
and is trying to set me up?

10:28.879 --> 10:31.674
Hmm. You know, this sounds
a lot like the premise

10:31.757 --> 10:33.759
of my latest Chad
Flenderman novel,

10:34.051 --> 10:35.511
A Murder for Framing.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.472
Chad Flenderman. Just an
easy-going black guy who knows

10:38.556 --> 10:40.766
the streets,
yet he also went to Oxford.

10:41.726 --> 10:46.939
So just as comfortable on a
motorcycle as he is on Air Force One.

10:48.399 --> 10:51.360
And he's also the world's
leading Egyptologist.

10:52.069 --> 10:56.282
Toby, nobody cares about your
sex-crazed black detective.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.410
No,no,no,no,no, women chase him.
He misses his wife.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.746
Hello, lacerated
hand here, folks.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.080
Nice try.
This is ridiculous.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.332
Oh, is it really?

11:04.415 --> 11:06.625
Two separate times
you have set me up to believe

11:06.709 --> 11:08.711
that I was being
recruited by the CIA.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.671
Three times, actually.
You see?

11:10.755 --> 11:12.131
Jim, this has your
fingerprints all over it.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.299
Andy, you've got
to be kidding me.

11:13.424 --> 11:15.551
Fingerprints can be planted.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.844
You know,
with a severed hand...

11:16.927 --> 11:18.054
Do you think
that's what happened?

11:18.179 --> 11:19.305
Do you think he
used a severed hand?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.724
Okay, you know what, why don't
we just call Animal Control?

11:21.807 --> 11:24.435
You might want to run that by Angela.
'Cause it's so cute.

11:24.894 --> 11:28.314
No. Porcupines don't have souls.
They're like dogs.

11:28.397 --> 11:29.357
Yes, I'm calling
from Dunder Mifflin.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.193
We have a very rabid
porcupine in our office.

11:32.443 --> 11:33.444
Someone should
come pick it up.

11:33.611 --> 11:34.612
Come down right away.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.781
I don't know, let me ask.
Were you quilled?

11:36.864 --> 11:37.865
Yes, I was quilled.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.325
And what's its name?
Henrietta.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.451
Oh.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.244
What? Uh...

11:42.953 --> 11:45.247
All right. Get her
out of here, Dwight.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.550
Hey.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.303
Guys, I just wanted to say...
Come here.

12:00.221 --> 12:03.224
I am so happy you
guys are together. Okay?

12:03.974 --> 12:05.810
And you both have
such beautiful hair.

12:06.852 --> 12:07.895
Thank you.

12:08.479 --> 12:09.980
I hope you guys get married.

12:11.107 --> 12:13.567
And who knows? Maybe at the
wedding, I meet someone.

12:13.943 --> 12:14.944
Okay.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.072
And later on tonight,
I hope I see you guys kiss.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.160
Yay.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.746
Okay, well, I'm gonna go do
another reverse spit.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.333
That's how the cool
kids say "get a drink."

12:33.629 --> 12:35.714
That's...
That's the girl you dated?

12:36.674 --> 12:39.885
Yeah, she's not always
like that. It's...

12:40.386 --> 12:42.304
No, she seems fun.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.641
Yeah, excuse me.
Okay.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.519
HEY
HEY

12:48.602 --> 12:51.439
Have you had anything to eat
besides candy canes?

12:51.814 --> 12:52.940
Every martini has an olive.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.233
Okay.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.777
Maybe I should make you
some oatmeal or something.

12:56.861 --> 12:59.697
I don't want to put you out, but
if someone's making oatmeal,

12:59.780 --> 13:01.031
I'll take an apple cinnamon

13:01.115 --> 13:04.118
and a maple brown sugar
in one bowl with whole milk.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.203
Hey, I never told
you my Christmas wish.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.997
Okay.
It's about you.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.209
That's not what it should be. It should
just be like a trinket or something.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.713
It's that I wish
Jessica was dead.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.717
You mean you wish
she wasn't here or something.

13:19.842 --> 13:23.804
I wish she was in a graveyard
under the ground

13:23.888 --> 13:26.182
with worms coming
out of her mouth.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.311
Hey, you know,
you can't say that, okay?

13:30.394 --> 13:32.730
That's my girlfriend
that you're talking about.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.149
You and I are not
together anymore.

13:36.025 --> 13:38.694
You need to get over it.
Take your wish back.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.655
Too late.
It's already been wished.

13:42.198 --> 13:45.409
And you promised it would come true.
You wrote it in an e-mail!

13:45.743 --> 13:49.705
So which one are you,
a murderer or a liar?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.090
HEY
HEY

14:00.466 --> 14:02.343
So there was talk of oatmeal.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.267
You know, don't listen
to what anyone is saying.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.062
You look like a princess.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.022
Yeah.
Thanks.

14:17.816 --> 14:18.943
I was too embarrassed.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.780
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.
I just found this on my desk

14:22.863 --> 14:24.782
and need to talk to
somebody about it.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.325
Can you believe that?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.285
Is that Cece?
Yes, it is.

14:28.536 --> 14:30.120
Oh, man.
That's awful.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.789
Cece is Jim's daughter.

14:31.956 --> 14:33.040
Oh, my God.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.542
How could somebody do that?

14:34.625 --> 14:35.793
I know. I mean,
the way I see it is,

14:35.918 --> 14:37.086
you can deface
any picture of me.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.796
Any one. Pick one.
Not my kid, though.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.297
Who did this?
Who did this?

14:40.422 --> 14:41.549
Do you know who did this?
I don't...

14:41.632 --> 14:44.176
I know who did this. Dwight.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.469
Dwight?
Yeah, he did.

14:45.553 --> 14:46.554
What? No.
He should pay.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.472
He is gonna pay.
This is fire-able.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.974
- Okay.
- It's... I mean...

14:50.057 --> 14:51.100
Let me just see
it one more time.

14:51.183 --> 14:55.229
You know what?
I know who my friends are now.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.647
But I shouldn't
have got you involved.

14:56.814 --> 14:59.066
Because the truth is, I don't even
really care about this picture.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.401
It's a little out of focus.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.986
It was probably an accident,
right? Like...

15:02.152 --> 15:03.362
That's no accident.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.991
Right. You're right. So maybe it
was me who did it. By accident.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.201
What?
I'll figure it out.

15:09.285 --> 15:12.162
Get to the bottom of it.
Merry merry.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.834
Enough of this garbage.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.921
This is Christmas.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.247
Christmas!

16:42.878 --> 16:44.088
You all right, Santa?

16:44.171 --> 16:45.547
You know those
movies where two friends

16:45.631 --> 16:47.383
are sleeping
together and it's like,

16:47.466 --> 16:49.009
hey, can they stay friends?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.177
Yes.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.220
Do you think two
friends who are

16:51.303 --> 16:52.596
not sleeping
together can stay friends?

16:53.305 --> 16:55.015
Two friends who are
not sleeping together,

16:55.140 --> 16:56.892
can they remain friends?
Yes, yeah.

16:57.393 --> 16:59.561
No. I... I don't know.

16:59.645 --> 17:00.813
Okay.
By the WHY,

17:00.938 --> 17:03.107
I'm not gonna mess with
your and Dwight's bonuses.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.275
I think it's
causing more problems.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.152
So just be yourselves,
have fun,

17:07.277 --> 17:09.113
and try not to let
it affect your work.

17:09.530 --> 17:11.073
All right.
I will definitely do that.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.408
All right. I'll tell Dwight.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.119
You know what?
You're sitting and thinking.

17:15.244 --> 17:18.122
And it's probably better
if it comes from me anyway.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.374
Christmas miracles do happen.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.501
Yes, they totally do.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.296
You can't click on
these Kardashian links.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.881
That's why you
have so many viruses.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.174
Well, help me, okay?

17:29.258 --> 17:30.300
I'm trying, but...

17:30.426 --> 17:31.385
You need to...
Kelly.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.637
Yo. On it.
Game on.

17:38.475 --> 17:42.062
I don't know what I was
thinking, it was awful. Awful.

17:42.146 --> 17:43.647
Jessica, did you just fart?

17:47.443 --> 17:49.153
And that is how it's done.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.405
I would like another alcohol.

17:52.156 --> 17:54.742
Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar,
you're in charge of the bar.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.369
What? I haven't
bartended in forever.

17:58.162 --> 18:00.456
Never considered
myself a mixologist.

18:01.123 --> 18:04.877
Oh, this is daunting. Um, I
need a mortar, pestle, muddier.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.795
Does anyone have any
chocolate shavings?

18:08.213 --> 18:09.923
Your heart is broken.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.842
So's mine.
And?

18:12.509 --> 18:13.761
And what?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.054
And do you have any
advice or anything...

18:16.180 --> 18:18.515
Oh, my God.
...to help me feel better?

18:18.599 --> 18:20.184
I've been married thrice,
and each

18:20.267 --> 18:22.603
has ended in
an acrimonious divorce.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.147
I'm not sure I'm the best
person to give love advice.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.026
I was hoping you were going
to make me feel better.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.906
When you do your makeup, how long
does it take usually? 'Cause...

18:33.989 --> 18:35.240
It depends.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.035
Chad Flenderman's
kryptonite...

18:38.202 --> 18:39.203
Woah.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.288
We got a real
Clarence Thomas here.

18:44.875 --> 18:45.876
Hi.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.797
I'll see you at home.
Okay. Okay, great.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.215
Perfect.
Bye.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.926
I still don't
get why you can't

18:54.009 --> 18:55.302
just call her
a cab and pay for it.

18:55.886 --> 18:59.014
I would, it just...
That wasn't the holiday wish.

18:59.306 --> 19:03.310
Either he drives or I drive,
and now I'm drunk and mad.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.396
Okay, We-
Okay, We-

19:07.606 --> 19:09.483
All right, come on, Meredith.

19:09.566 --> 19:12.027
Bye. Thank you, Santa.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.529
You bet.

19:13.612 --> 19:15.739
Thank God Erin's getting
a ride home with Robert,

19:15.823 --> 19:17.407
'cause she is trashed.

19:17.491 --> 19:18.992
And who better to drive
her home than Robert?

19:19.076 --> 19:22.037
I mean, what
a stand up guy, you know.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.123
I mean, he's going through a lot.
Separating from his wife,

19:25.666 --> 19:28.919
showing up at the Christmas party
in a track suit and a blazer.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.966
Let's go, let's go.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.717
I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.427
Hang on.
All right.

19:38.262 --> 19:41.098
Woah! My stuff!
What? What is all that?

19:41.306 --> 19:42.391
It's my valuables!

19:42.516 --> 19:43.600
It's junk.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.269
This is my treasures.
No, they're my treasures!

19:45.352 --> 19:46.603
You're a hoarder. My God!

19:46.728 --> 19:48.689
No, I'm not!
I'm gonna sell it on eBay!

19:48.772 --> 19:50.440
No, no, no, you be careful.

19:50.566 --> 19:53.277
Be careful!
Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.286
What are we gonna do with all
that bonus money, Henrietta,huh?

20:02.452 --> 20:04.830
Where are we?
This ain't my street.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.334
Oh. This is the posh
part of town, huh?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.839
Oh, my God.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.218
Wonder what a studio condo would
cost in this neighborhood.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.762
Meredith, shut your
drunk hole right now.

20:24.016 --> 20:25.809
Erin, it was
great fun tonight.

20:26.476 --> 20:30.272
Take a few aspirin, drink a whole lot
of water, sleep in in the morning.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.985
Thank you. Good night.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.617
What are you smiling for?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.036
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:46.204 --> 20:48.040
I'm sure I am not.

20:48.957 --> 20:50.334
Let's get you home.

20:51.752 --> 20:52.753
Ow!

20:54.004 --> 20:55.422
Take it easy!

21:01.470 --> 21:03.263
Oh, man!

21:03.889 --> 21:06.099
Fell asleep. Took a nap.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.353
Hey, guys.
I feel refreshed now.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.146
How's it going?
Dwight.

21:11.355 --> 21:15.525
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk.
I feel so good right now.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.152
Mmm. Cookies.

21:17.778 --> 21:19.237
What's everyone staring at?

21:20.364 --> 21:23.116
Oh, man! I was supposed
to tell Dwight something.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.495
Come on, Jim.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.957
I got nothing.
