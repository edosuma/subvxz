00:05.120 --> 00:06.280
If you want to do something in life,

00:06.360 --> 00:07.360
if you want to get on stage,

00:07.440 --> 00:08.880
you have to come out of your comfort zone.

00:09.080 --> 00:13.320
I hope the audience is kind
enough to understand my jokes.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.920
Please make a lot of noise.

00:15.000 --> 00:15.960
That's what I'm hoping for.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.920
And I hope people have fun.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.280
Hi! I'm your host and part-time
wannabe DJ Sapan Verma.

00:57.480 --> 01:00.240
And my guest for today's
episode is an Indian rapper,

01:00.320 --> 01:03.360
music producer and serial disser Raftaar.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.280
And helping him with his comedy gambit

01:05.360 --> 01:07.800
is the rook of Indian comedy,
Samay Raina.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.840
I'm famous.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.080
But I've started live
streaming on YouTube.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.680
-Anybody follows that?
-Yes!

01:17.800 --> 01:18.640
Easy money!

01:18.920 --> 01:20.880
People send "superchats" for shoutouts.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.120
They're paying you to
give them a shoutout.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.200
I'm so used to superchats now,

01:25.280 --> 01:27.560
if a girl says "Say my name"
when we're having sex,

01:27.640 --> 01:29.080
I demand 40 bucks!

01:33.200 --> 01:34.400
It's easy to earn money.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.200
But very hard to manage money.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.560
Nobody teaches you
that when you are a child.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.360
I won Comicstaan.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.840
I won ten lakh rupees.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.720
That's when I went to a
bank to open an account.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.440
They were like,
"First, you need to get a PAN card."

01:46.600 --> 01:47.840
I went to get my PAN card,

01:47.920 --> 01:49.240
they're like,
"Link it to your Aadhar card."

01:49.880 --> 01:51.600
I got it linked. Then they're like,
"Have you finished KYC yet?"

01:51.680 --> 01:53.480
I was like, "Oh, it would have
been easier to come second!"

01:55.360 --> 01:56.480
Why am I jumping through hoops?

01:56.560 --> 01:57.680
You should do the work!

01:58.360 --> 02:00.400
I'm paying the government, right?
They should do the leg work!

02:00.480 --> 02:01.760
I have to fill the
forms and everything.

02:01.840 --> 02:03.520
Try and send a Google Pay
request at least!

02:04.800 --> 02:05.600
I have to do everything?

02:05.680 --> 02:07.800
And if I can't do it,
I'm the one who goes to jail!

02:09.040 --> 02:10.000
Imagine, if I go to jail,

02:10.080 --> 02:11.320
there's a murderer on my right

02:11.520 --> 02:12.640
and Munawar on my left.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.960
Okay?

02:16.760 --> 02:18.040
And what is my crime?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.400
Being in the Indian education system!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.560
Nobody taught us anything
about taxes, you know?

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
What did they teach us?
Mitochondria.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.160
Etched that information
deep in our brains.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.600
I've never used this
information in my life!

02:31.120 --> 02:31.880
Teach us about taxes!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.040
But how could a teacher do it?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.880
They're probably outside
the tax bracket themselves.

02:37.040 --> 02:37.960
Just…

02:40.840 --> 02:42.000
Do you guys do drugs?

02:42.840 --> 02:44.000
Why are you guys lying?

02:45.800 --> 02:46.960
See, I'm not saying do drugs.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.360
I'm not asking you to do drugs.
I am saying…

02:49.240 --> 02:50.160
Try it.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.240
Don't "do" drugs.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.240
Do drugs.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.480
Don't become a stoner.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.960
My roommate is a stoner,
don't become a stoner.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.400
One day, he was so stoned that…

02:59.760 --> 03:00.720
at 3:00 a.m.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.080
he turned on the flashlight on his phone…

03:02.600 --> 03:03.840
to look for his phone.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.440
I asked him, "What are you doing?"

03:09.640 --> 03:11.160
He said, "Bro, I can't find my phone."

03:12.160 --> 03:13.760
I said, "Trying calling your phone."'

03:15.360 --> 03:16.360
He said, "I tried, but it's busy."

03:16.440 --> 03:17.640
I was like, "You dumbass!"

03:21.160 --> 03:22.600
Have you ever met a cross-eyed person?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.560
Ever met a guy whose
eyes are slightly crossed?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.280
See, it is fine until a degree.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.560
But after 45 degrees,

03:30.600 --> 03:33.160
I don't understand which of
the eyes I should look into.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.800
I take turns looking into both eyes.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.480
Is this the one?
Which one is it? Which one?

03:39.560 --> 03:41.080
And then I can't focus
on the conversation.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.760
I keep agreeing. "Yeah, yeah.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.280
Yeah!"

03:47.560 --> 03:50.160
See, I'm not making
fun of cross-eyed people.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.080
I love cross-eyed people, I admire them.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.640
Imagine a cross-eyed basketball team.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.560
The opposing team would get
so scared if you dunk it like this!

04:04.000 --> 04:06.400
There's a tactic in basketball,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.000
which is called The Fake.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.160
The Fake.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.640
My girlfriend had used it once.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.240
But that's a story for another time.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.160
Okay?

04:14.960 --> 04:17.240
So, in The Fake,
you start dribbling the ball.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.120
You look in one direction and
throw the ball in another.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.160
And the opponent is baffled like,
"What did he just do?"

04:23.000 --> 04:25.120
Cross-eyed people have the real fake!

04:26.120 --> 04:27.680
Imagine a guy who does this.
"Bro, what was that?"

04:27.920 --> 04:28.800
"It's called The Fake."

04:28.920 --> 04:29.880
"Look at me when you talk to me."

04:29.920 --> 04:30.800
"I am looking at you."

04:33.200 --> 04:34.160
Thank you so much, guys!

04:34.240 --> 04:35.760
You've been a lovely audience.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.200
Keep laughing and smiling.

04:46.600 --> 04:47.520
Hello, hello, hello!

04:47.680 --> 04:48.920
-How's it going, bro?
-I stopped the game for you.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.080
Oh, man! You start playing
chess wherever you get a chance.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.040
Color-coordinated. Nice!

04:55.120 --> 04:56.000
The two of us… nice!

04:56.080 --> 04:57.520
-Man, I dressed up so nicely
-That's cool!

04:57.600 --> 04:58.520
because I was going to meet Raftaar.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.920
I thought he'd be in
some neon-colored outfit.

05:00.040 --> 05:00.800
And look at me.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.360
He is the celebrity of this episode.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.520
That's true, he is. You and I are
on the same team, color-coded.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.800
Okay, let's start from the start.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.160
First of all, how did you
choose the name Raftaar?

05:10.240 --> 05:13.120
You know, I actually, for real, thought
of this name when I was on the toilet.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.920
And this has now become the story.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.080
I tell everyone the same story.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.440
So, everyone had taken on a name.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.360
Everyone who was with me had
chosen great names for themselves.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.200
What were you doing on the toilet
that made you think of Raftaar (speed)?

05:22.520 --> 05:23.600
It was like that.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.080
I believe I had gone to
the toilet after a long time.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.040
Did you have loose motions?

05:27.360 --> 05:29.440
You know,
I'm trying to control the filth here.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.520
-I'm trying very hard.
-Nice, bro.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.640
I'm also doing character cleansing.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.760
Oh, wow!

05:35.800 --> 05:36.840
That's why you are on this show.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.760
-Yes, to become a gentleman.
-Gentleman?

05:38.840 --> 05:40.920
But, sir, our friendship
will not go to the next level.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.800
-It will!
-It'll go to the next level

05:42.880 --> 05:44.320
when I release a diss track about you.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.800
Yes, that is the right chronology.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.920
It happens in that order.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.320
-First, we'll work together.
-Right.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.200
Once we've worked together,
you'll expect certain things from me.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.840
Then you'll not share
those expectations with me.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.040
-You'll never express them!
-Yes!

05:53.120 --> 05:53.920
Then you'll release a diss.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.160
It's a whole package.
Raftaar package.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.320
-You'll also book Purple Haze Studios…
-An entire package.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.720
No, there's a pro package,
where I hit back as well.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.360
That's an expensive package.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.520
That requires a helicopter as well.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.560
Yes, it-- It's a costly package.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.000
In that package, I respond
and people talk about it.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.440
That's an expensive package.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.800
But what are the
stereotypes about rappers?

06:09.880 --> 06:10.920
Do people assume things about you

06:11.000 --> 06:12.600
and then are shocked
to realize you are a simple guy?

06:12.680 --> 06:14.000
Well, they have these
standard assumptions.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.000
That rappers are womanizers, rash drivers,

06:17.080 --> 06:19.480
that they keep getting into fights,
do drugs…

06:19.560 --> 06:21.400
-It's a long list.
-How many of these are true?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.000
I'm right here,
an open book for you to see.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.880
I have such beautiful girls with me.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.000
If I FaceTime such
pretty girls in quarantine,

06:28.080 --> 06:30.080
you can guess how corrupt
rappers really are.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.960
Right? What a fair maid,
like a Kashmiri apple.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.200
Kashmiri apple! Oh, man!

06:34.760 --> 06:36.800
Was your family cool with you rapping?

06:36.880 --> 06:37.920
When you told them you want to rap…

06:38.000 --> 06:40.240
My family was cool with any kind of art.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.600
One thing is when people
stay home and pursue it as a hobby.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.200
And parents can figure out
when you're working towards your dream.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.120
But did they know about rap, what rap is?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.880
Or did you have to sit and explain…

06:48.960 --> 06:51.080
Yeah, one day, my mom
seriously asked me, "What is this?

06:51.160 --> 06:52.320
Why is this singer swearing?"

06:52.520 --> 06:55.000
So, I explained the song to her.
It was Eminem's <i>Lose Yourself</i>.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.040
It has that line,
"Tear the roof off like two dogs caged…"

06:58.200 --> 06:59.800
There's some swearing
in that song as well.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.480
So, I had to tell her,
"He's talking about ambition, passion,

07:03.720 --> 07:04.920
how he will never give up…"

07:05.000 --> 07:05.960
She said, "Okay. That's nice."

07:06.040 --> 07:06.840
It's the same with my family.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.560
When Comicstaan happened,

07:08.920 --> 07:10.400
I had used a lot of
cuss words on the show.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.880
I had used words like "ass" a few times.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.080
My mom saw it.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.320
Then I ended up winning.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.440
So, she thought,
"Maybe that's how it works."

07:17.520 --> 07:18.600
But have they seen your live show?

07:18.680 --> 07:20.200
-Have they come for your live show?
-No. Never live.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.760
-Never?
-I get very uncomfortable.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.440
I'm not that comfortable yet.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.720
-You never invite your parents?
-No, in my case, it's the opposite.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.320
-I get scared.
-Why?

07:28.440 --> 07:30.360
My mom starts dancing, dude.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.440
My mom gets excited,
with the people and all.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.760
And then it's like the other way around.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.240
I'm like, "Mom…

07:37.160 --> 07:39.160
Mom… it's my show.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.600
Mine!

07:41.360 --> 07:43.160
In the beginning, I announce,
"My mother is here."

07:43.240 --> 07:45.720
Then my mom starts dancing,
so everyone is like, you know, "Oh!"

07:46.160 --> 07:47.080
I mean, it's a good thing.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.960
People are thinking,
"I wish my mom was like her."

07:49.040 --> 07:49.880
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.240
-That's what people instantly think.
-Of course.

07:51.440 --> 07:52.240
"How cute!"

07:52.320 --> 07:54.320
They all look at her and nobody
pays attention to my show.

07:54.840 --> 07:55.960
Mom begins her own show.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.480
What is it that you can do in rap,
but cannot do in stand up?

07:59.720 --> 08:01.560
I feel that they're both very similar.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.440
-Why?
-Yeah.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.400
-I also agree.
-Yes.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.640
I mean, we're just poking fun at everyone.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.920
Either at ourselves or others.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.680
You do the same thing.
You get on stage

08:07.760 --> 08:09.400
and you either make fun
of yourself or of others.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.280
We do the same.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.640
We talk about ourselves,
how we used to be,

08:11.720 --> 08:13.040
there was a time when we were idiotic.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.320
How we saw the same stuff…

08:14.400 --> 08:16.680
Or we talk about how we reached the place
we're at now, "I have a car and money…"

08:16.760 --> 08:18.360
We don't reach that place.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
-We never reach that place.
-But…

08:19.520 --> 08:20.880
No, that's just how you save taxes.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.120
It's not that you cannot reach it.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.880
You're like, "Look at the
gold chains around their necks,

08:24.040 --> 08:25.000
please focus on them.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.400
We'll quietly be on the side.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.400
Look at how poor we are!
I mean, look at our shoes."

08:28.480 --> 08:30.520
He's wearing glasses that cost 300 rupees!
I am here in rented clothes.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.440
How?

08:31.520 --> 08:32.800
No, no, we can never reach that stage.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.560
Only a handful of us do.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.920
Why are you looking at me?

08:36.040 --> 08:38.000
-You have to win reality shows.
-Samay is like, "Don't count me in those!"

08:38.240 --> 08:39.760
Samay is repelling you with his vibes.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.520
He's like, "Don't talk about
these things with me."

08:41.720 --> 08:44.280
He's getting on stage for
the first time ever, this Saturday.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.120
So, if you have to give him some advice,
what would you give him?

08:47.200 --> 08:48.040
Oh, yeah.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.280
-Sir!
-Sir…

08:49.360 --> 08:50.160
Sir…

08:50.400 --> 08:53.880
-First of all, big fan of Emiway Bantai!
-Yeah.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.360
-Nice man, me too! Sick guy.
-So, see…

08:56.440 --> 08:58.440
the point is, you've to surprise.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.640
Comedy is all about surprise, right?

08:59.720 --> 09:01.520
There's a setup, like I did.
"Big fan of…

09:02.160 --> 09:03.120
And then you didn't expect it…

09:03.200 --> 09:05.320
-Yes, you don't expect that. Okay.
-Yeah.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.520
Every joke is a surprise.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.600
You've to make sure the audience doesn't
see it coming and you surprise them.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.200
That is the essence of comedy, okay?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.520
When you do stand up, there is a rhythm.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.080
Rhythm of your words.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.320
If I say something, for example,

09:16.400 --> 09:18.120
if I say, "I was walking on
the street yesterday and I saw a dog

09:18.200 --> 09:19.040
and I was like, 'Oh, is that a dog?'"

09:19.360 --> 09:20.240
This is my way of saying things.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.400
The same thing,
you can say in your own rhythm.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.360
You can't say it like me.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.440
Yes, everyone has a different style.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.400
-So, you have to figure your rhythm out.
-Okay.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.400
Deliver it with that confident rhythm.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.160
You have to deliver it
with that confidence, because…

09:31.240 --> 09:32.600
That's nice. Rhythm…

09:33.040 --> 09:34.320
-timing…
-Yes.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.720
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

09:36.360 --> 09:38.120
You're explaining it so nicely,

09:38.200 --> 09:40.240
"You need rhythm, it's
important. Maintain the beat!"

09:40.640 --> 09:42.520
-Your beat.
-Yes, our meter.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.480
So, there's a meter in comedy too.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.480
Okay?

09:45.520 --> 09:47.120
Don't look at me like that.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.760
Go on, go on.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.120
He's like, "Are you going to teach me?"

09:51.200 --> 09:52.280
No, no. It's not that.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.000
I'm just observing that
there are many similarities.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
It's so good, no,
how he sees everything as music…

09:56.240 --> 09:57.640
Like, I see everything as chess.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.840
Get it?

09:58.880 --> 09:59.720
Even comedy?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.640
-Everything. Everything.
-You've become a player.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.440
-I mean, if I--
-Playing with hots…

10:03.520 --> 10:04.760
If I say something and he replies,

10:04.840 --> 10:06.760
I see it as, "Okay, it's a good move,
he made a better move.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.080
Now I have to make a better move."

10:08.160 --> 10:10.440
I can't tell the bishop and knight apart.
I don't know which is which.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.000
-Bishop is the elephant, right?
-No!

10:12.080 --> 10:13.640
-Bishop is the camel, bro.
-Bishop is the camel?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.440
-Beauty!
-And-- Which one's the horse?

10:15.520 --> 10:17.520
Please, my chessboard
can't handle all this.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.640
-Camel is the desert animal, right?
-Yes, it's a camel.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.520
-No, it's not a camel.
-It is a camel, bro.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
Which one is the knight?
It's the horse?

10:22.640 --> 10:23.480
Knight is the horse.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.360
So, which one is the bishop?

10:24.440 --> 10:25.280
Bishop is the camel!

10:25.360 --> 10:26.360
Bishop is the desert animal, right?

10:26.440 --> 10:27.280
Man, camel is…

10:27.360 --> 10:29.320
-Camel is a desert animal, bro!
-What's wrong with you?

10:30.720 --> 10:32.000
But are you nervous about comedy?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.520
I'm excited, you know, there's a…

10:33.640 --> 10:34.840
There's one feeling
where you're just scared.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.280
The other kind is like,
"Oh, gosh, this is about to happen!"

10:37.520 --> 10:38.840
I've seen a lot of comedy.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.040
And amongst friends,
you know how they pump you up, right?

10:42.120 --> 10:43.520
Like, "Man, you are so funny."

10:43.880 --> 10:45.760
So, I'm going to test this assumption!

10:45.880 --> 10:47.480
We know how to handle stage.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.640
I can handle being on stage.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.160
But I don't know what kind of crowd…

10:50.360 --> 10:51.960
Because the crowd I get is like,
on a high.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.640
They jump around…

10:53.760 --> 10:55.760
There are guys who have brought their
girlfriends along, paid for their entry.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.880
They're like, "Dance!"
They want their money's worth!

10:57.960 --> 11:00.760
They're all busy because
they're doing all this.

11:00.840 --> 11:01.640
In your case…

11:01.720 --> 11:03.240
the crowd has to pay and then keep quiet.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.240
Kind of difficult to get
people to do it, man!

11:05.320 --> 11:06.440
What we like to do on this show is also,

11:06.520 --> 11:07.800
we like to do something
called role reversal,

11:07.880 --> 11:09.680
where we would like
to learn something from you.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.800
Sure, let's do something.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.400
-Will you teach us something?
-Sure, full power.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.440
Let's go, sir.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.600
Oh, role reversal.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.720
Role reversal.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.400
-You want to give him your cap?
-No, thanks.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.880
-Let's bounce.
-Let's go.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.760
What are you going to
teach us in Role Reversal?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.680
Let's do a rap.
He loves rap as well.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.200
-He does it on his streams.
-Yeah.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.760
Definitely something
that you're not used to.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.400
-Of course, not at all!
-Definitely not.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.360
Let's pick a random word.
It's the same thing.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.160
You don't really need
a lot of context these days.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.040
Oh, that's how it is?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.360
Yes, that's how it is.
What can we do?

11:38.800 --> 11:42.400
Pick any word and then
rhyme it with something.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.120
Add more words to it
and let's try and match it.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.520
If you want to mess with me, don't fight.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.040
Come and play chess with me.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.480
That's a diss track right there.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.480
He's so happy. Sapan is like, "Yes!"

11:58.720 --> 12:00.040
And before you get on stage,

12:00.480 --> 12:01.280
there's a tradition.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.440
When you leave your
home to do something good,

12:03.560 --> 12:04.880
people feed you yogurt before you leave.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
Rappers have a tradition of giving caps.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.720
I want to perpetuate this tradition.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.000
Here, take your caps.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.560
Have fun!

12:14.720 --> 12:16.200
Okay, we're gonna wear this.

12:17.040 --> 12:17.840
Let's go.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.440
Okay. Are we doing it?

12:19.520 --> 12:21.200
Are we doing it?
Okay, let's do this.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.000
Alexa, can you beatbox?

12:24.400 --> 12:25.560
Let me introduce you guys.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.040
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:28.560 --> 12:29.760
on One Mic Stand,

12:30.680 --> 12:33.080
we got Sapan and Samay

12:33.160 --> 12:34.400
right here to waste your time.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.600
Yo! Yo!

12:38.040 --> 12:39.400
-Shall I say "Yo"?
-Sure, that works.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.400
<i>If you wanna mess with me</i>

12:41.560 --> 12:42.360
<i>Don't fight me</i>

12:42.440 --> 12:43.720
<i>Come play chess with me</i>

12:43.920 --> 12:45.680
<i>The price of teaching you is zero</i>

12:45.880 --> 12:47.640
<i>Why did you try to guess the fee?</i>

12:50.600 --> 12:51.680
Insert meme right here.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.280
What say, public?

12:54.680 --> 12:55.480
Go.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.760
<i>I'm going to rap</i>
<i>Give me a cap</i>

12:57.840 --> 12:59.960
-<i>With my homeboy Samay OP</i>
<i>-OP!</i>

13:00.040 --> 13:01.720
<i>He doesn't have one, I have a goatee!</i>

13:01.920 --> 13:03.680
<i>My swag is OG, yours is a copy!</i>

13:05.760 --> 13:07.600
Bro, you killed it.
No, but the thing is, you know…

13:07.680 --> 13:09.400
-Now you've both become friends.
-Yeah.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.800
-Give me a line. Throw a line!
-Yo, yo…

13:11.880 --> 13:13.720
<i>Whatever jokes we make</i>
<i>We'll make them land</i>

13:13.800 --> 13:15.720
<i>Whatever we do, it will be grand!</i>

13:15.920 --> 13:17.680
<i>We three guys, we make a band</i>

13:17.760 --> 13:19.640
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, One Mic Stand!</i>

13:19.720 --> 13:21.080
Jump! Jump!

13:21.160 --> 13:22.480
Jump! Jump!

13:22.560 --> 13:25.480
-<i>Jump! Jump!</i>
-Faster!

13:25.680 --> 13:28.120
-Now, get closer, get closer!
-Jump!

13:28.360 --> 13:29.720
-Jump!
-Make angry faces.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.160
No, that's too much.

13:33.760 --> 13:34.640
Alexa, pause.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.080
Done, we got it.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.800
-We should do a tour!
-Yes!

13:38.880 --> 13:39.960
2022…

13:40.880 --> 13:42.440
One Mic Stand band is ready!

13:49.560 --> 13:51.280
-Hey!
-Oh, man…

13:51.360 --> 13:52.200
Don't thank me.

13:52.280 --> 13:53.360
You look great.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.000
-How are the jokes, are they good? Ready?
-Thank you.

13:55.080 --> 13:55.880
Great!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.600
It's not like you gave
me some top-secret formula.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.640
It's just jokes.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.680
Just jokes?

14:00.760 --> 14:01.840
-Of course!
-I like this attitude.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.800
-I've never seen anyone so relaxed.
-It'll be fun.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.920
-Very nice.
-This is how I am.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.680
Don't make him nervous by
saying that he's too relaxed.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.600
No, it's a good thing.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.640
-It's a good attitude to have.
-Stay the same.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.560
When you're relaxed, we also feel--

14:09.640 --> 14:10.960
No, dude, it's just that
I laugh even when I'm scared,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.080
so people don't find out.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.800
Even if I'm scared on stage, I'll be like…

14:14.080 --> 14:15.480
Oh, damn!

14:15.560 --> 14:17.480
-Let's go kill it!
-Let's go kill it!

14:18.360 --> 14:19.840
-That was great. Let's go.
-Yes.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.040
-Shall we do the soundcheck?
-Yes, do it.

14:21.120 --> 14:21.960
Come on.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.800
You've spent a lot of money!

14:26.120 --> 14:27.080
You see that white tape?

14:27.320 --> 14:29.160
That's a good mark to stand.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.120
Raftaar knows everything.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.680
Basically, we don't need to do anything.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.920
He's a live performer.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.200
So, he came on stage…

14:34.280 --> 14:36.000
Normally, we have to tell
people how to use the mic,

14:36.080 --> 14:37.240
how the lights fall, and things…

14:37.320 --> 14:38.720
-He was like, "Done."
-He was telling us things like,

14:38.800 --> 14:40.520
"If you throw the light this way,
it'll look better."

14:40.600 --> 14:41.560
I was like, "Okay!"

14:44.160 --> 14:46.640
If it doesn't go well,
make a diss track on Samay and Sapan.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.480
So, usually, the concern is that

14:49.560 --> 14:51.120
the person should not
perform with low energy.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.840
In Raftaar's case, I'm concerned that

14:52.920 --> 14:55.760
he shouldn't perform with such
high energy that he alienates people,

14:55.840 --> 14:57.200
like, where does he
get so much energy from?

14:57.280 --> 14:58.720
Check, check, check…

14:59.160 --> 15:01.320
<i>Raftaar gives a beat</i>
<i>The heat is on</i>

15:01.520 --> 15:04.040
<i>Freestyle, I'm playin' Pokémon</i>

15:04.120 --> 15:07.320
<i>Alright, let's go to Pune and kiss</i>

15:07.400 --> 15:08.200
<i>You know me!</i>

15:08.280 --> 15:09.320
Done. Good sound check.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.680
It is so good to be back doing
live shows after eight or nine months!

15:20.040 --> 15:21.920
It is an honor to perform
for you guys right now,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.200
because in the pandemic,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.720
I tried those online Zoom comedy shows.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.560
Zoom shows are shows after which

15:27.640 --> 15:29.600
the audience get back
to their living rooms

15:29.680 --> 15:30.960
and comedians get depressed.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.080
The other problem
with online shows is that

15:35.320 --> 15:37.280
people forget that it's a show, where

15:37.360 --> 15:39.040
I'm supposed to talk,
you're supposed to laugh.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.040
They think it's a video chat.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.160
People start conversing anywhere.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.520
Like normally, the host comes on stage and
asks, "Are you guys doing good?"

15:46.600 --> 15:48.000
You guys say, "Yes."
We move on.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.840
In an online show, I asked,
"Are you guys doing good?"

15:49.920 --> 15:51.880
A woman said, "Not good.
My maid didn't come today.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.080
I had too much work to do.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.240
But we'd bought tickets to your show,
so we had to attend."

15:57.280 --> 15:58.200
That's what's happening.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.200
And I thought online
comedy shows were bad.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.000
I thought that is the
worst that it can get.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.080
Until, in November,
I attended an online music festival.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.280
Basically, what happens is
you pay money to watch

16:10.360 --> 16:12.280
somebody play music on your laptop.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.000
That's not a concert!

16:14.080 --> 16:15.600
That's just YouTube Premium!

16:16.920 --> 16:18.000
That's what it is, right?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.520
At one point, the audience is like,
"Once more, once more!"

16:21.760 --> 16:24.360
The musician got excited, he's like, "Oh,
you guys liked the song so much?"

16:24.560 --> 16:25.960
They were like, "No, actually,
you were on mute the first time.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.120
We couldn't hear anything."

16:30.080 --> 16:31.240
That's what's happening.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.720
I think the only people
who enjoyed online music festivals

16:34.800 --> 16:36.000
were short people.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.920
But at least I respect the fact
that they followed the protocols, right?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.520
They played music from their homes.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.920
Because there was a proper on-ground music
festival announced in Goa in October.

16:47.360 --> 16:48.880
In the middle of a pandemic!

16:49.280 --> 16:50.920
People were like,
"Bro, there's a pandemic going on."

16:51.000 --> 16:52.240
They were like,
"Just come over, we'll manage."

16:53.520 --> 16:54.880
We were like, "Bro, there is COVID."

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
They were like,
"COVID doesn't go to the beaches.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.960
COVID is a mountain person,
not a beach person. Relax."

17:00.920 --> 17:02.360
Then they got a lot
of flak on the internet.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.520
People shamed them,
like "How can you do this?"

17:04.600 --> 17:05.800
So then they made another announcement.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.080
They were like, "No, guys, don't worry.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.880
We'll do a properly socially
distanced and sanitized music festival."

17:11.160 --> 17:12.520
And I was like, "That's bullshit."

17:13.560 --> 17:17.240
When has health ever been
a priority in a music festival?

17:17.800 --> 17:18.800
You'll never go to a music festival

17:18.920 --> 17:21.960
where the musician is like, "Alright,
everybody put your hands up in the air.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.080
And now focus on your breath."

17:26.000 --> 17:27.400
That's not going to happen, right?

17:29.080 --> 17:30.040
Alright!

17:30.960 --> 17:32.640
Your final act of the evening.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.680
You have seen him rap multiple times,

17:34.760 --> 17:36.560
you have seen him judge
TV shows multiple times.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.320
But tonight, he's trying
stand up for the first time ever.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.400
So, please put your hands together,
welcome to the stage Raftaar!

17:46.240 --> 17:47.320
What's up, what's up?

17:51.880 --> 17:53.080
Oh, man!

17:54.320 --> 17:55.560
I thought I'd get on the stage with swag

17:55.680 --> 17:59.080
and start speaking, "Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Raftaar."

17:59.160 --> 18:01.320
And like your parents
and grandparents say,

18:01.400 --> 18:02.800
"This is the one who talks fast, right?"

18:04.080 --> 18:07.880
But actually, speaking
fast does not make a rapper.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.080
Rapping is not about talking fast.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.400
If it was, you know who
would be the best rapper?

18:12.560 --> 18:14.040
Mutualfundinvestmentsare
subjecttomarketrisks

18:14.080 --> 18:15.960
pleasereadtheofferdocument
scarefullybeforeinvesting.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.920
That man would be
the best rapper in India.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.000
When I travel by flight,

18:22.440 --> 18:24.560
uncles ask me,
"Son, what do you do for a living?"

18:24.680 --> 18:26.800
I reply, "Uncle, I rap."

18:27.800 --> 18:29.440
Then they ask, "What is that?"

18:29.640 --> 18:31.520
So, I sing a bit,
'Knicker and a t-shirt…"

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
Copyright issues.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.200
So…

18:39.920 --> 18:42.040
I am like, "Uncle, this is what rap is."

18:42.400 --> 18:44.000
He's like,
"Why are you talking so fast, son?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.800
Take a breath, pace yourself."

18:45.880 --> 18:48.200
I was like, "Uncle, if I pace myself,

18:48.280 --> 18:49.320
it'll be a ghazal."

18:50.760 --> 18:53.320
But that doesn't satisfy Uncle.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.040
Not at all.
Uncle says, "Son,

18:55.080 --> 18:57.080
jokes aside, tell me what
you really do for a living."

18:57.960 --> 18:59.320
I am fed up with this question.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.080
So, now I say,
"Bro, I'm a judge on <i>Roadies."</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:10.080
There are many similarities
between rap and comedy.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.400
Has anyone felt it?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.320
See, we talk about struggles.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.320
They also talk about struggles.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.280
There are punch lines in my songs,

19:17.520 --> 19:19.160
there are punch lines in their jokes too.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.240
My songs have bars,

19:22.200 --> 19:23.920
and comedians are behind the bars.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.280
So, ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Raftaar.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.160
You know me by this name.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.800
But my real name is Kalatil
Kuril Devadasan Dilin Nayar.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.160
I'll repeat it.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.440
Kalatil Kuril Devadasan Dilin Nayar.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.720
And it's a fact that while saying my name,

19:42.800 --> 19:45.080
even Shankar Mahadevan
has to take another breath.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.480
Memorize my name.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.080
It might be the answer to a 20,000-rupee
question on <i>Kaun Banega Crorepati</i> anytime.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.240
Might come in handy.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.640
People also ask me about this.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.440
So, I went to my parents.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.800
And I said, "Dad, I want to rap."

20:04.080 --> 20:05.960
It's an old story,
they didn't know rap at the time.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.680
He was like, "Do what you want to.
Do it. But do it well."

20:11.000 --> 20:12.680
I said, "Dad, what if I can't succeed?"

20:12.960 --> 20:15.280
He's like, "No worries, son.
We'll open a shop for you.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.000
You can sell peanuts or something."

20:19.320 --> 20:20.680
I explained it to my family…

20:21.080 --> 20:23.960
I had seen that in a rapper's life,

20:24.040 --> 20:26.440
struggles and rejections
are very important.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
Because I was in the same boat.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.320
My economic condition was such that

20:29.560 --> 20:31.560
I could rap about poverty and my pain.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.800
But my parents treated us like royalty.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.240
Mad shoutout to them.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.800
So, I told my dad…

20:39.560 --> 20:40.920
I told my dad.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.080
I said, "Dad, the thing is that,
don't say such nice things.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.560
Say things like,
"Will you become a beggar?

20:47.920 --> 20:50.040
I'll throw you out of the house.
You'll be serving fried peanuts.''

20:50.240 --> 20:51.240
I said, "Say something like this.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.440
Only then the fire within
me will come bursting out!"

20:57.960 --> 21:00.200
Now, rappers have cool names.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.480
It's important that
they have cool names, right?

21:02.560 --> 21:07.080
Like Raftaar, Badshah, Yo Yo Honey Singh.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.200
There's no joke here.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.440
When these three names come together,

21:10.520 --> 21:12.080
they make news, not jokes.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.000
Some of you might have
seen these rich rappers as well.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.640
They talk about Lamborghinis.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.960
Lamborghini doesn't
have to advertise itself.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.000
The Punjabi industry
is taking care of that.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.760
Right? Rolex, chains…

21:27.800 --> 21:29.240
Or there will be the
other kind of rapper like,

21:29.320 --> 21:31.440
"I came from the bottom, now I'm here."

21:31.720 --> 21:34.080
Has anyone seen a middle-class rapper,
someone in the middle?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.680
Have you heard names like…

21:35.760 --> 21:37.080
Medium Mahesh!

21:38.800 --> 21:40.480
Relatable Rakesh.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.080
You know?

21:43.200 --> 21:44.800
That doesn't work, right?
What will he rap about?

21:45.440 --> 21:48.720
Like, "Life is full of EMIs,
relationships are damaged.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.680
I eat peanuts, never tasted pistachios."

21:54.040 --> 21:55.160
It doesn't…

21:55.440 --> 21:56.960
You can't take him seriously.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.680
If he has a beef with me,

21:58.760 --> 22:01.240
I'll have to come up with
<i>Sheikh Chilli</i> to diss him.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.160
He'll send a message…

22:05.760 --> 22:06.800
He'll say to me,

22:06.880 --> 22:08.520
"Bro, give me some
coriander with the chilli!"

22:12.640 --> 22:15.200
These new generation rappers,
they are like kids.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.440
You know what kind?

22:16.680 --> 22:17.960
Do you attend weddings?

22:18.560 --> 22:20.440
You must be going up to
the food counters at weddings.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.760
There's always that
one rascal kid standing far,

22:23.040 --> 22:24.640
and mocking you with his gestures.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.480
The problem is that
every person feels like

22:27.560 --> 22:29.280
grabbing him and slightly…

22:29.720 --> 22:30.520
Like, changing his direction.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.080
If he's walking from there,
send him to this side.

22:32.920 --> 22:33.760
But they can't do it.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.000
Because the problem is that

22:35.080 --> 22:37.360
as soon as they start shouting,
people judge you.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.200
Did you get it?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.920
There are a lot of
misconceptions about rappers.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.480
Like, Raftaar owns a Lamborghini.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.560
Whenever I travel to some city,

22:50.640 --> 22:52.040
someone comes and asks me,

22:52.920 --> 22:56.560
"So… how is the Lamborghini running?"

22:57.200 --> 23:00.120
See, first of all, this question is silly.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.200
What do you mean by "How is it running?"

23:02.600 --> 23:03.760
I mean, ask me this question, bro.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.560
Ask me this question.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.120
"How is the Lamborghini running?"

23:09.440 --> 23:10.320
It's running great, man.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
It's burning a lot of fuel these days.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.080
Let me know if you know a good CNG seller.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.320
See.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.560
That reminds me of a great real joke

23:20.640 --> 23:22.880
that has actually happened in my life.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.600
There's a rapper called Karma,
who is signed with us at Kalamkaar.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.200
His little brother is called Abhishek.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.240
So, Karma was excited
to get on a flight and travel.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.680
At that moment, his brother
asks him, "Bro, tell me something.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.960
If we buy a Maruti car
and remove its roof,

23:39.680 --> 23:40.640
how will it look?"

23:43.120 --> 23:44.160
See…

23:46.440 --> 23:47.640
It won't cost much money.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.360
But it might cost us our dignity.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.320
People also think that we like to indulge.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.800
Full power.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.840
I went to a city for a show.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.560
I was done with the show at night.
I was free.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.480
These guys approached me.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.360
They said, "Bro, shall we take you there?

24:05.680 --> 24:06.760
It'll be fun!

24:07.720 --> 24:08.640
Night market!

24:09.760 --> 24:10.680
Are you getting me?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.360
I was like, "Look,

24:13.600 --> 24:15.200
tell me where I can get some <i>kachoris.</i>"

24:16.920 --> 24:18.120
And addictions…

24:19.280 --> 24:21.240
I know that you already associate
rappers with addictions.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.320
Let me tell you that we
do have an addiction.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.720
Badshah and I consume it together.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.120
Full power.

24:27.840 --> 24:28.800
Sugar.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.240
White sugar.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.800
For the kids sitting at the back,

24:34.880 --> 24:36.920
it's the sweetener. Sugar. Okay?

24:37.320 --> 24:39.240
Imagine you hear this
headline the next day.

24:40.440 --> 24:45.920
A late-night raid on the rappers'
cars led to the discovery of two kilos of…

24:46.520 --> 24:47.680
<i>Kaju katli!</i>

24:50.880 --> 24:55.520
And the way these rappers
have broken it into pieces,

24:55.960 --> 24:58.520
they are the real Tukde Tukde Gang!"

25:03.680 --> 25:07.600
Okay. One more news I read about myself

25:07.680 --> 25:09.480
was that I have 100 million rupees.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.760
I have 100 million rupees, dude!

25:13.120 --> 25:14.880
Yes, exactly!

25:15.440 --> 25:16.480
I've ordered a JCB.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.480
I'm going to dig and find
out where it's coming from.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.880
Tell me something.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.800
If I had 100 million,

25:24.920 --> 25:27.320
would I play chess online with Samay?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.840
I'd be with Zakir, looking at the clouds.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.880
Clouds are important.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.440
You know, I also like to interact.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.240
I get messages from kids
and I read them very seriously.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.200
Like, "Bro, I want to get into rapping.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.840
My family is not supportive.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.440
I have a lot of passion.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.160
But I'm surrounded by problems.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.400
Please guide me."

25:50.760 --> 25:52.160
I ask them, "Child, what do you do?"

25:52.480 --> 25:53.640
He's like, "I'm twelve."

25:58.000 --> 25:59.800
I said, "Son, what will you rap about?"

26:00.600 --> 26:03.640
"My Math paper was very hard!"

26:04.560 --> 26:06.800
What will you say?
"Our time will come…"

26:07.240 --> 26:08.840
Son, at this age,
you'll only get your timetable.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.040
So, at this point,
I've suddenly realized that

26:16.120 --> 26:17.760
I've run out of jokes.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.160
And if you liked it, that's good.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.920
Or else just diss me, I don't care.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.080
-Give it up for Raftaar, everyone!
-Give it up for him.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.520
Everybody, come on, loud!

26:38.720 --> 26:40.240
Give it up for Samay Raina!

26:41.000 --> 26:41.880
And I'm Sapan Verma,

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
-thank you so much, guys!
-Give it up for Sapan too!

26:44.160 --> 26:45.680
Thank you so much, guys!

26:55.840 --> 26:57.800
Okay! It is done!

26:57.960 --> 26:58.760
How do you feel?

26:58.840 --> 27:00.720
-Tell me how you felt.
-We loved it.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.960
-Do you feel like a great burden is off?
-Yes.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.880
Bro, when you're performing on stage,
you're not waiting for a reaction.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.480
-Yeah.
-You keep on performing.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.640
This, with every punch line,
you wait and like…

27:10.560 --> 27:12.560
So, you are asking them how they liked it.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.840
The whole point of this show is

27:13.920 --> 27:15.680
to establish that stand up
is not as easy as it seems.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.280
That's the reason, in Role Reversal,
I didn't teach you to rap properly.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.400
Was there a joke that didn't land?
What did you think of the reaction?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.760
Were you waiting but the audience
was not laughing, or not really?

27:25.840 --> 27:27.560
-No, bro.
-I wasn't even waiting to begin with.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.440
Halfway into the show,
I learnt that I'd have to wait.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.200
I was like, "No.
Let them laugh, let them laugh."

27:31.880 --> 27:32.680
They like laughing.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.200
They like laughing.
Let them have a laugh.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.440
Okay, done!
