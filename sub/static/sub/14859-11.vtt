Like Old Spice commercial with
the black guy in the shower.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.723
What's he selling?
Old Spice.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.480
The Old Spice commercial with
the black guy in the shower.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.731
What is he se--?
Oh, he's selling Old Spice.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.313
Well, it's pretty quiet
around here.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.607
| guess I should go ahead
and pack her up for the night.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.032
Hey, man.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.321
Sorry I let you down.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.331
Oh, no, man,
we're in it together.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.866
| mean, it was your idea,
you shot it,

18:48.169 --> 18:49.625
and you locked me out
of the editing room,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.457
but it's on me too.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.873
They call it Hollywood,
not "Holly-friends."

18:55.176 --> 18:57.133
We're not in Hollywood.
MAN: Dude.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.339
| saw your commercial.
| loved it.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.925
You did?
Yeah.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.964
You spoke from the heart,
you know?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.974
| called my dad for the
first time in nine years.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.306
Awesome.
MAN: Yeah.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.766
Well, we're gonna go
get hot dogs,

19:09.065 --> 19:10.851
then play checkers
with some Puerto Rican guys.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.436
See you.
FATHER: Let's go, son.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.351
MAN: Dad, this is great.
FATHER: I love you.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.487
We did it.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.444
Take it myself.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.371
[SIGHS]

19:26.666 --> 19:27.155
Why don't you have pasta salad,

19:28.209 --> 19:31.042
have something in your mouth
other than lies?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.624
Okay. And while I'm doing that,

19:33.923 --> 19:34.879
why don't you catch a movie?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.835
Like Liar Liar

19:37.134 --> 19:38.841
or What Lies Beneath.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.468
Ooh, or Narnia.
There's a lion in it.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.721
Babe, what are we doing?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.508
Are we lying to each other
so we don't have to be together?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.267
Brad, we love being together.

19:48.562 --> 19:52.100
| mean, come on, everyone wishes
they had our mojo, yo.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.232
Yeah, I said that.
Let's keep moving.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.109
We're coming back.
Okay, fair enough.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.986
Look, we go on trips together.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.486
We go to the movies together.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.193
We even go cheese
shopping together.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.325
Yeah, like I can trust you
to pick a good Camembert.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.578
But there's nothing wrong having
a little private time too.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.285
Honestly, didn't you like
having a little Brad time?

20:10.584 --> 20:12.074
Well, it was nice watching
The Boondocks,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.834
not having to explain
why it's funny.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.586
| wanna love it.
| don't get it.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.713
Sometimes I don't get it.
Maybe it's okay

20:18.008 --> 20:20.545
if once a year
Sara comes to visit,

20:20.845 --> 20:23.132
and you have to go
on a last-minute work retreat.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.092
Babe, I was lying
about work retreats.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.507
We usually go on, like,
an off-site--

20:27.810 --> 20:29.767
Oh, it's a metaphor.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.848
| get it.
Yeah, you will get it.

20:32.148 --> 20:35.186
[BOTH MOAN]

20:35.484 --> 20:37.100
[BOTH SIGH]

20:39.697 --> 20:41.563
Mm. Oh, my God. Oh.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.694
And after dinner,
they brought two horses

20:47.997 --> 20:49.237
into the museum courtyard.
Shut up.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.079
Liam and his friend dressed up
as knights and jousted over me.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.914
It was the most romantic night
of my life.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.045
It sounds super romantic.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.172
Oh, you know what?
Keith showed up after you left.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.708
Really?
Yeah.

21:02.011 --> 21:04.628
Well, the guy is devastated.
Was he destroyed?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.716
It was rough.
But we ended up hanging out.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.680
Making English-muffin pizzas,
talking. It was nice.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.264
It was?
Yeah.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.803
After those
extravagant dates

21:14.106 --> 21:15.596
where I'm, like,
hunting quail,

21:15.900 --> 21:18.062
it was nice to kick back
and connect with someone.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.068
It was perfect and so simple.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.735
Hmm.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.115
| want Keith back.

21:35.002 --> 21:35.082
