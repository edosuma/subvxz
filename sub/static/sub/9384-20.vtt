[Brian farts]

14:12.102 --> 14:14.521
-Pull my finger.
-My pleasure.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.984
Hey, Peter?
This next one you can blame on the dog.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.448
Silent but lifesaving.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.785
What the hell is this?
Didn't you see that sign?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.330
You've sullied my factory and disobeyed

14:31.413 --> 14:33.665
my rules! I want you to
leave immediately!

14:33.749 --> 14:37.169
Come on! Don't I at least get
a Chumba Wumba song?

14:37.878 --> 14:38.962
Fine.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.255
[Penny whistle playing]

14:42.633 --> 14:45.260

[Crickets chirping]

14:53.435 --> 14:57.356
Come on, Meg. The competition is this
Sunday and you're not even close to ready.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.483
Maybe if you loosen my chains?

14:59.566 --> 15:03.320
We tried that. Remember, honey?
You can't be trusted.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.573
Lois, take a letter.
"Dear Pawtucket Pat...

15:06.657 --> 15:09.618
"...I hate you. You are a bad man.

15:09.785 --> 15:13.330
-"And you made me cry. Furthermore--"
-Not now, Peter.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.708
-Meg and I are having a little girl time.
-Help me!

15:16.834 --> 15:18.710
Go on. No boys allowed.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.296
Jeez, Lois! Still with the piano?

15:21.380 --> 15:24.424
What's a guy got to do to get
a little attention around here?

15:25.300 --> 15:26.510
[Piano playing]

15:28.470 --> 15:30.305
[Beautiful piano music]

15:30.389 --> 15:33.684
Peter, that's incredible!
I don't understand how....

15:33.767 --> 15:35.811
You're like the idiot from Shine!

15:35.894 --> 15:40.274
Meg, you're free.
Try the clarinet. Keep playing!

15:40.399 --> 15:42.401
[Beautiful piano playing]

15:44.361 --> 15:46.572
[Playing begins to degenerate]

15:48.866 --> 15:51.326
LOIS: No. Play it like you
did last night.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.120
I can't.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.206
Peter, talent doesn't disappear
just like that.

15:56.290 --> 16:00.043
Sometimes it does.
You were pretty bad in bed Saturday night.

16:00.502 --> 16:04.214
PETER: Come on, Lois. Move or something.
Jeez, it's like doing it with a pillow!

16:04.631 --> 16:07.467
Peter, I stayed at my mother's that night.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.721
Jeez! This hangover's killing me.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.473
I haven't felt this crappy
since I went to that museum.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.562
-Why did all the dinosaurs die out?
-Because you touch yourself at night.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.232
Here. This'll make you feel better.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.610
[Plays piano hesitantly]

16:29.072 --> 16:30.824
[Plays beautifully]

16:32.910 --> 16:34.745
BRIAN: I think we found his muse.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.081
Oh, my God! You can only play the piano
when you're drunk.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.166
That's not true.

16:39.249 --> 16:43.337
I can also vomit, fall down and make
dirty calls to your sister when I'm drunk.

16:43.420 --> 16:46.131
Go pick up a case of beer.
We got a lot of practicing to do.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.257
Practicing? What for?

16:47.341 --> 16:50.177
The competition.
You're gonna be my first champion.

16:50.260 --> 16:54.306
Play that sad walking-away
song from The Incredible Hulk.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.592
Hey, thanks.
You think that was great, watch this.

17:30.968 --> 17:35.848
Lois, I'm losing my buzz!
I need more talent juice.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.516
Another beer already?

17:37.599 --> 17:41.687
I guess I don't have to be prepared
for the competition.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.647
I need another pitcher over here.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.776
Wow! Lois must have written
the book on man-pleasing.

17:48.235 --> 17:52.531
Too bad Loretta doesn't allow
white literature in our household.

17:52.865 --> 17:55.492
How much harm can one more pitcher do?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.119
This is for the sake of art, right?

17:57.202 --> 18:00.747
Don't start with me, Brian.
This may not be my proudest moment.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.916
But, damn it! I want to win.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.836
You're not the first person
to do whatever it takes to win.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.798
You come to me and ask me
to kill a man I do not know.

18:10.507 --> 18:14.303
I ask you,
why should I kill this Count Chocula?

18:14.428 --> 18:16.972
Because that son of a bitch
has been spreading lies!

18:17.055 --> 18:21.018
My cereal does not cut the roof
of your mouth! With all respect.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.607
KID: I can't believe I'm missing
Ronnie's party for this.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.483
That Ronnie's a bad influence.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.986
Yeah, that little bastard sold me
some really bad crack!

18:31.069 --> 18:33.572
Stay out of it, Herb!
You're not even his real father.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.201
LOIS: Yes. We're checking in.
The student's name is Peter Griffin.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.994
Oh, yes. He's on in an hour.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.079
Yeah. Where's the nearest liquor store?

18:41.163 --> 18:44.291
They're all closed on Sundays.
This is a dry county.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.503
I can't do it without booze!

18:47.586 --> 18:50.672
Maybe this is a sign
that we need to stop this.

18:50.756 --> 18:54.468
I've been keeping you ripped
out of your head for my own selfish needs.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.887
I'm ashamed. Let's just go home.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.307
Now, Lois. We can't stop now
after all we've put into this.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.477
Yo, fresh! How do I get to
Ronnie's party?

19:03.602 --> 19:06.313
Peter, we're not going
to a high school party!

19:06.396 --> 19:08.190
-Lois.
-Alexis.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.733
-Loser says what?
-What?

19:11.944 --> 19:12.986
I'll drive.

[Rock music playing at party]

19:15.572 --> 19:16.573
Consume!

19:18.700 --> 19:21.578
-I love you so much.
-This sucks!

19:21.662 --> 19:25.040
When I was your age,
we had way better drinking games.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.669
You drink!

19:29.837 --> 19:30.921
[Siren wailing]

19:31.547 --> 19:33.257
KID 1: It's the cops!
KID 2: Run!

19:37.177 --> 19:40.514
Hold it, you two. Aren't you a little old
to be drinking illegally?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.434
Lois, look over there! Run!

19:47.980 --> 19:49.231
[Piano being played]

19:50.983 --> 19:53.652
I want to make you feel beautiful, Lois.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.697
Peter, stop. Try to stay focused.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.198
[Applause]

20:00.158 --> 20:01.743
Okay. You're on.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.913
Wait, here's a little something
for good luck.

20:08.333 --> 20:12.171
Make sure your trills are clean and watch
the legato in the fourth measure. Go!

Bravo!

21:00.093 --> 21:01.970
We did it, Brian.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.065
BRIAN: Congratulations, Lois.

21:13.148 --> 21:17.069
For what? Winning a trophy
at the expense of my husband's health?

21:17.152 --> 21:19.446
God knows how many
of his brain cells I killed...

21:19.530 --> 21:21.865
...pouring all that alcohol
down his throat.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.283
Lois, you don't get it.

21:23.367 --> 21:27.996
The lesson here is that abusing alcohol
has absolutely no negative consequences.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.500
You have your trophy
and my brain cells are just fine.

21:32.668 --> 21:35.629
Hello? Where is everybody?

21:36.296 --> 21:39.132
I'm the only brain cell left.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.009
At least I have my books.

21:43.637 --> 21:47.808
No, that's not fair!

21:48.433 --> 21:50.143
There was time now!
