00:02.834 --> 00:04.267
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me

00:04.267 --> 00:06.801
Damian, come with me.
We'll do a sweep from here up.

00:06.801 --> 00:09.634
What's up?

00:09.634 --> 00:11.934
I'm good here.
You said stick together.

00:11.934 --> 00:15.434
And now I'm saying unstick.
Go.

00:15.434 --> 00:18.067
I know I got the brains
and the balls to do the job.

00:18.067 --> 00:20.667
Maybe I can make a difference
doing something else.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.133
Yeah? What else?

00:22.133 --> 00:24.834
Off the top of my head,
something that doesn't involve

00:24.834 --> 00:26.300
getting fried up in a fire?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.033
We can give this one more shot.

00:28.033 --> 00:29.968
Okay.
Okay, but this is the last time,

00:29.968 --> 00:31.634
and no outside distractions.

00:31.634 --> 00:33.534
None.
And no Sheila.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.968
And if I find out that you guys

00:34.968 --> 00:36.834
have seen each other
afterwards

00:36.834 --> 00:38.667
or if there is anything
going on...

00:38.667 --> 00:40.801
Nothing. Nothing.

00:40.801 --> 00:43.801
This isn't over
because you crawled over here

00:43.801 --> 00:46.167
with your tail tucked
between your legs.

00:46.167 --> 00:49.901
It is over because I decided
it was over ages ago.

00:49.901 --> 00:53.834
Oh yeah, the sex sucked.

00:55.234 --> 00:56.934
You got to be shitting me.

00:56.934 --> 00:58.868
What? Oh. No, no, no, Mick.

00:58.868 --> 01:01.167
- Oh, Mickey, no. Mickey.
- Wait, wait.

01:02.634 --> 01:04.367
Mickey.
Who are you calling?

01:04.367 --> 01:06.767
If he calls Janet,
shows up at my house, I'm dead.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.367
Anybody, um, call?

01:09.367 --> 01:11.667
Huh? Nope.
Nobody called.

01:11.667 --> 01:12.834
Katy, dinner.

01:16.267 --> 01:17.934
Hey, coz.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.033
Mm. Mm.

01:26.033 --> 01:28.868
Mickey, I am so glad
that you stopped by.

01:28.868 --> 01:30.701
And you're having
my favorite dish.

01:30.701 --> 01:33.267
I mean, come on.
What are the odds of that?

01:33.267 --> 01:34.801
You just moved into a new place?

01:34.801 --> 01:36.267
Mm, over in Brooklyn.

01:36.267 --> 01:37.801
- How is it?
- It's nice,

01:37.801 --> 01:41.133
plus I got all this nice,
new furniture

01:41.133 --> 01:45.801
because Sheila just moved, heh,
and I got her old stuff.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.400
It's nice.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.133
She's got this beautiful place
over in Chelsea, unbelievable.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.968
You been there, Tommy?

01:52.968 --> 01:55.400
Mm.
Yes? No?

01:55.400 --> 01:57.734
As you know, Sheila likes
to move around a lot.

01:57.734 --> 01:59.734
She's kind of
a real estate gypsy.

01:59.734 --> 02:02.767
Every time she moves,
she buys a new set of furniture.

02:02.767 --> 02:04.400
This one went in my favor,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.634
but she has a beautiful
new place.

02:06.634 --> 02:09.567
Mm, you sure
you haven't been there?

02:12.467 --> 02:14.801
I love my new neighborhood. It's
very hip.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.667
On the other hand, Sheila's
neighborhood is much more...

02:18.667 --> 02:20.501
I don't know. How would you
describe.

02:20.501 --> 02:22.901
Sheila's neighborhood,
Tom?

02:27.133 --> 02:30.167
- What, are you choking?
- Yeah. He's choking.

02:30.167 --> 02:32.934
No.
Yes. Yes. Tommy?

02:32.934 --> 02:34.467
Tommy, you okay?

02:34.467 --> 02:35.767
Dad? Dad...

02:35.767 --> 02:37.200
You okay, sweetheart?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.100
Tommy, do you need some water?

02:39.100 --> 02:40.200
Hold, hold. Hold on.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.334
Do you need water?

02:42.334 --> 02:44.200
Oh, he does need it.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.801
Yes. That's what I said.

02:45.801 --> 02:47.033
Here, Tommy.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.868
Dad, drink some water.
Are you okay?

02:48.868 --> 02:50.367
Are you okay?

02:51.801 --> 02:55.200
Dad, can you breathe?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.601
Uncle Mickey, do something.

02:56.601 --> 02:58.300
Do something.
He can't breathe.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.801
Dad, dad, are you okay?

02:59.801 --> 03:01.200
Just drink some more water.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.634
Oh, my God.
Mickey, do something.

03:03.634 --> 03:05.501
Good? Is that good?

03:05.501 --> 03:07.567
Here, here, here...

03:07.567 --> 03:10.033
Katy, get the door.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.734
He's all right. Here we go.
Hey, Dad.

03:14.634 --> 03:16.400
You okay?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.634
Hey. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bang.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.534
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Okay.

03:24.534 --> 03:26.434
Look. Look.
Nothing happened.

03:26.434 --> 03:29.267
We didn't do anything.
Are you okay?

03:29.267 --> 03:31.300
What the hell
did you do to him?

03:31.300 --> 03:34.400
Tommy was choking,
and Mickey saved him.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.701
Ooh.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.501
You really got to learn
how to chew your food, Tommy.

03:48.501 --> 03:51.667
Kids, go get some ice cream.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.467
I don't want ice cream.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.801
Then go to the movies.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.234
There's nothing to see.

03:56.234 --> 03:58.634
Then go shopping.

04:00.434 --> 04:01.801
There.

04:01.801 --> 04:03.267
And buy what, a sock?

04:05.367 --> 04:07.067
There you go, then.

04:07.067 --> 04:09.734
How long do you want
us to be gone for?

04:11.767 --> 04:12.801
At least an hour.

04:12.801 --> 04:16.200
How about one hour
or $1,000,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.067
whichever comes first?

04:18.067 --> 04:21.100
Well, how about you charge
one cent over $100,

04:21.100 --> 04:24.467
and you don't have to worry
about coming home?

04:25.767 --> 04:28.634
Oh, is that, um, a hundred for
each of us or total...

04:28.634 --> 04:29.801
Go.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.033
Fine. I'm going.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.133
Anything you want to say
to start?

04:43.767 --> 04:45.300
What the hell is going on?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.801
I'll tell you
what's going on.

04:47.801 --> 04:50.467
These two, I walk in,
on top of each other,

04:50.467 --> 04:51.634
her with the dress off.

04:51.634 --> 04:53.267
I can explain that.
Oh, really?

04:53.267 --> 04:54.767
You can explain that?
Yes.

04:54.767 --> 04:57.300
Can you explain
Einstein's theory of relativity?

04:57.300 --> 04:58.367
That would be easier.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.067
Where the apple
falls on his head.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.334
Sheila, you, dress off.

05:02.334 --> 05:03.534
We're all ears.

05:03.534 --> 05:06.400
Okay. First of all,
completely innocent.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.701
Well, I mean, well,
not completely innocent.

05:08.701 --> 05:10.000
You saw what you saw,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.400
but what you saw was not
what you thought you saw.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.100
It wasn't. Honey,
I'm telling you, it was not...

05:17.634 --> 05:19.434
Could you explain it?

05:19.434 --> 05:20.601
Okay. Look.

05:20.601 --> 05:23.767
This is what happened.
Ahem.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.100
He grabbed me from behind.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.701
He kissed me.
French kissed me.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.067
Threw me down on the couch,
tore off my dress...

05:29.067 --> 05:31.634
- What?
- You didn't do that?

05:31.634 --> 05:33.534
Yes. No.
Oh, my God.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.000
It wasn't all I did.
It was...

05:35.000 --> 05:37.534
Jesus.
No, no. We did, that we did.

05:37.534 --> 05:39.901
He was like an animal.
Oh, I was like an animal.

05:39.901 --> 05:42.300
I told you to leave.
Like you wanted me to leave.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.767
Just shut up.

05:44.767 --> 05:47.501
Did you or did you not
take her dress off?

05:49.300 --> 05:51.634
Yes, but...
Thank you.

05:51.634 --> 05:54.467
I did a lot of other stuff
before that.

05:54.467 --> 05:56.000
- Oh, such as?
- Such as,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.534
he made more moves on me
which had none effect on me.

05:58.534 --> 06:00.834
I told him to get out,
when he grabbed me again.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.234
What... What?
You're gonna lie about that too?

06:03.234 --> 06:04.701
I'm lying. Ha, ha!

06:04.701 --> 06:06.968
Oh, stop.

06:06.968 --> 06:08.734
Did you?

06:08.734 --> 06:10.300
Did I... Did I what?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.534
Did I lie? No. I didn't lie.

06:12.534 --> 06:13.834
I'm not lying. What?

06:13.834 --> 06:18.300
Did you kiss her,
and did she ask you to leave?

06:20.033 --> 06:21.801
Yes, but...
Now I'm gonna punch him

06:21.801 --> 06:24.067
in the face right now.
No, not yet.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.367
The thing is,

06:25.367 --> 06:28.167
she said that after I told her
that it was over

06:28.167 --> 06:30.000
because I told her
that you and me...

06:30.000 --> 06:32.234
You and me were gonna be...
It's "you and I."

06:32.234 --> 06:34.400
Oh, I know.
His grammar is such shit.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.400
Stay out of this.

06:38.400 --> 06:42.167
And then she gave me
this angry, sexy...

06:42.167 --> 06:44.934
look, like a vixeny thing.

06:44.934 --> 06:46.334
Yeah, yeah.
Vixeny?

06:46.334 --> 06:47.868
Yes. Yes.
It was vixeny,

06:47.868 --> 06:52.100
and then, you know,
yes, we both...

06:52.100 --> 06:54.033
We were kissing each other.
We kissed.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.400
We kissed each other,
then we were on the couch,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.300
and then we were both,
you know...

06:59.300 --> 07:01.067
With the clothes.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.467
But then we both realized

07:02.467 --> 07:08.501
how stupid and idiotic
and stupid that this was,

07:08.501 --> 07:10.300
and we stopped.

07:11.968 --> 07:14.167
I stopped first.
Oh, I call bullshit.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.334
I stopped first.
Honey, I stopped first.

07:16.334 --> 07:17.734
Uh, listen.

07:17.734 --> 07:20.667
Mickey, I told him

07:20.667 --> 07:24.133
what a fabulous kisser
I think that you are,

07:24.133 --> 07:25.434
didn't I?
Yes.

07:25.434 --> 07:28.734
And that I care deeply
for you,

07:28.734 --> 07:30.434
didn't I?
Yep.

07:30.434 --> 07:33.067
Care deeply?
Yeah.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.567
Okay.

07:34.567 --> 07:37.367
Yeah. I said that
right from the start.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.300
Do you love him?

07:42.300 --> 07:44.367
Unh, not anymore.

07:46.367 --> 07:47.767
Are you in love with her?

07:51.601 --> 07:54.467
Have you ever been
in love with her?

07:56.701 --> 07:59.601
You prick.
You're such a...

07:59.601 --> 08:02.100
Wait. But...
But what?

08:02.100 --> 08:05.701
Listen. I...

08:05.701 --> 08:09.267
Obviously, I, you know...

08:09.267 --> 08:13.801
I cared deeply at...

08:13.801 --> 08:15.968
I did,

08:15.968 --> 08:19.701
but I love you.
You know that. She knows that.

08:19.701 --> 08:21.934
I love you, I've always been
in love with you,

08:21.934 --> 08:24.834
and I'm always gonna be
in love with you.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.601
Yeah, except for the five years
when you were with me,

08:27.601 --> 08:30.534
you said it was all you could do
to keep from strangling her.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.033
Listen, Janet.
We had a thing.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.133
We had a hot
and torrid thing

08:35.133 --> 08:38.467
that despite what he says,
involved love and passion

08:38.467 --> 08:40.033
and insane excess,

08:40.033 --> 08:41.868
but that's all tonight was
about.

08:41.868 --> 08:43.767
It was these
final dying embers

08:43.767 --> 08:47.334
of this lust and this connection
that we had.

08:47.334 --> 08:49.934
I told him to leave
because I treasure what it is

08:49.934 --> 08:51.300
I've discovered
with you,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.167
and he took that
as a challenge,

08:53.167 --> 08:54.334
and so, yeah, whatever.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.167
We went at it
for a couple seconds,

08:56.167 --> 08:59.300
but then I stopped it because
I knew that it had to end.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.934
I knew
what his Janet plan was.

09:00.934 --> 09:02.534
I knew that
he still loved her,

09:02.534 --> 09:04.100
but, more importantly,

09:05.601 --> 09:07.801
I knew
how I felt about you.

09:11.534 --> 09:13.367
Well...
Shut up.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.334
I believe her.
Oh...

09:23.334 --> 09:24.767
I do, too.

09:29.634 --> 09:32.367
What?

09:42.601 --> 09:46.033
Hey, you think
they went in there to have sex?

09:46.033 --> 09:47.434
What?
Why do you think that?

09:47.434 --> 09:48.667
To get back at us.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.067
Oh, my God,
what are you, 12?

09:50.067 --> 09:53.734
Think that's what they're doing?
No.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.667
Yes.
You never loved me?

09:56.667 --> 09:58.767
Of course I loved you,
okay?

09:58.767 --> 10:00.300
I'm sure
you felt the same way,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.734
but I obviously always
was in love with Janet.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.601
You were always
in love with Jimmy.

10:04.601 --> 10:06.033
I mean,
let's face facts.

10:06.033 --> 10:07.567
Don't tell me
you love Mickey.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.734
No way
you love Mickey.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.567
I think
I could learn to love Mickey.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.434
Oh, my God, get off,
Tommy.

10:28.801 --> 10:30.234
That's the end of it.

10:30.234 --> 10:31.767
She's with me from now on.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.033
I'm gonna talk to Damian,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.334
and from now on,
you stay away from her and him.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.267
You got it?

10:37.267 --> 10:40.033
Good. Let's go.

10:46.467 --> 10:50.033
Now, if you weren't a wee
little bit in love with her,

10:50.033 --> 10:52.200
I might lose
a little faith in you.

10:53.534 --> 10:55.434
Were you?

10:55.434 --> 10:56.534
Little bit.

10:58.267 --> 10:59.667
Well, whatever.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.167
It's over now.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.200
Why'd you let him hit me?

11:03.200 --> 11:08.133
Because he hits harder
than I do.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.701
<i>* On another day</i>
<i>C'mon, c'mon *</i>

11:27.701 --> 11:31.467
<i>* With these ropes tied tight</i>
<i>Can we do no wrong? *</i>

11:31.467 --> 11:34.300
<i>* Now we grieve</i>
<i>'Cause now it's gone *</i>

11:34.300 --> 11:37.534
<i>* Things were good</i>
<i>When we were young *</i>

11:37.534 --> 11:41.133
<i>* When my teeth bite down</i>
<i>I can see the blood *</i>

11:41.133 --> 11:43.901
<i>* Of a thousand men</i>
<i>Who have come and gone *</i>

11:43.901 --> 11:47.501
<i>* Now we grieve</i>
<i>'Cause now it's gone *</i>

11:47.501 --> 11:50.300
<i>* Things were good</i>
<i>When we were young *</i>

11:50.300 --> 11:53.968
<i>* Is it safe to stay? *</i>
<i>* C'mon, c'mon *</i>

11:53.968 --> 11:57.033
<i>* Was it right to leave? *</i>
<i>* C'mon, c'mon *</i>

11:57.033 --> 12:00.767
<i>* Will I ever learn? *</i>
<i>* C'mon, c'mon *</i>

12:00.767 --> 12:03.634
<i>* C'mon, c'mon</i>
<i>C'mon, c'mon *</i>

12:09.434 --> 12:12.033
Well, a quick glance
at the test results tells me

12:12.033 --> 12:14.267
it was definitely another
heart attack, Ken.

12:15.767 --> 12:18.667
How you gutted through it,
as you said, I have no idea.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.234
Strong like bull.

12:20.234 --> 12:21.701
Not anymore,
you're not.

12:21.701 --> 12:26.734
Uh, there's severe
tissue damage here.

12:26.734 --> 12:31.367
Your heart's working
at maybe 50 percent capacity.

12:31.367 --> 12:34.367
Yeah, but isn't there
some kind of surgery

12:34.367 --> 12:35.367
you can do?

12:35.367 --> 12:37.467
No.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.734
No. The damage
is so extreme that...

12:41.434 --> 12:43.634
So why don't you just say it?
I'm a dead man.

12:43.634 --> 12:46.734
No, but you're gonna
have to give up working.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.601
No. No. I don't think so.

12:51.734 --> 12:53.033
You're gonna have trouble

12:53.033 --> 12:55.133
getting up a flight of stairs,
Ken.

12:55.133 --> 12:57.534
Flight of stairs and smoke

12:57.534 --> 13:00.968
with 50 pounds of gear
on your back, you're in trouble.

13:00.968 --> 13:03.934
Now, I've been
your personal physician

13:03.934 --> 13:06.767
for 20 years.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.601
In that time, I've seen you here
a total of three times.

13:09.601 --> 13:12.300
You go back to work,
there may not be a fourth.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.501
Call the department
tomorrow.

13:14.501 --> 13:18.667
Tell them to start sending
the pension checks,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.000
right?

13:23.167 --> 13:25.701
Saving that baby, it was like...

13:25.701 --> 13:28.200
Man, it was wild.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.167
I mean, I can't imagine
any other job

13:30.167 --> 13:32.033
being as rewarding as this,
you know?

13:32.033 --> 13:33.601
Yeah. I know,

13:33.601 --> 13:35.267
but you got to ask yourself
this.

13:35.267 --> 13:38.100
Are you any less afraid
now than when you started?

13:39.434 --> 13:41.434
No,

13:41.434 --> 13:44.100
but I know that Tommy
and the guys have my back,

13:44.100 --> 13:46.300
so, you know,
that makes it a little easier.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.467
What about when Tommy's
not here anymore?

13:48.467 --> 13:49.701
What do you mean?

13:49.701 --> 13:51.067
The guy
is one in a million,

13:51.067 --> 13:53.234
but let's face it.
He's on borrowed time.

13:53.234 --> 13:56.300
The day comes he's not here
to hold your hand. Then what?

13:56.300 --> 13:58.701
Yeah. Well, I think Tommy
is gonna be around

13:58.701 --> 14:00.634
for a long time, Mick.
I mean...

14:00.634 --> 14:03.667
he just quit drinking
and smoking.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.434
Two out of three
ain't bad.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.634
What are you talking about?

14:07.634 --> 14:11.033
Danger.
Danger is his main addiction.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.334
Let me ask you,
you in love with the job?

14:15.334 --> 14:17.200
Yeah.
You don't sound so certain.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.634
No. I like it, all right?
I like it a lot.

14:19.634 --> 14:20.901
Like is not good enough.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.834
Okay. I love it.

14:22.834 --> 14:23.901
How much?

14:23.901 --> 14:26.167
I don't know. This much.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.968
Wise guy.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.801
You love it as much
as you love pussy?

14:29.801 --> 14:32.701
No. I mean, come on.
Who does?

14:32.701 --> 14:34.968
Tommy. Tommy Gavin does.

14:34.968 --> 14:36.934
Put him in a room
with Jennifer Lopez.

14:36.934 --> 14:40.234
She's buck naked, raring to go.
He's gonna lose interest.

14:40.234 --> 14:41.801
You light that room
on fire,

14:41.801 --> 14:44.767
gonna have a hard-on the size
of the Empire State Building.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.501
You, you're gonna be
very afraid.

14:46.501 --> 14:48.267
Of the fire or J. Lo?

14:48.267 --> 14:49.434
Probably both.

14:52.601 --> 14:53.734
Uh...

14:55.267 --> 14:57.801
Yeah. I don't know
about quitting, Uncle Mick.

14:57.801 --> 15:01.400
I mean, Tommy once said

15:01.400 --> 15:03.100
firefighting
isn't just a job.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.167
It's a calling,
and I believe that.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.501
I believe it's my calling.

15:07.501 --> 15:09.567
Yeah. I had a calling.

15:09.567 --> 15:10.834
You want to know from who?

15:10.834 --> 15:13.534
From God, or so I thought.

15:13.534 --> 15:15.534
Twenty years
I spent chasing the cross.

15:15.534 --> 15:18.200
Whole time I knew I was
on the wrong side of the altar.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.400
Why?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.934
Pussy. I couldn't get
my mind off of it.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.334
I'd be saying mass,
checking out the chicks

15:25.334 --> 15:26.767
in the first five, ten pews.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.934
I was serving up communion
to these hot moms

15:28.934 --> 15:30.467
on their knees
at the altar.

15:30.467 --> 15:33.400
You know, I'm having some very
unholy thoughts at the time,

15:33.400 --> 15:36.234
and then I realized I didn't
have a calling, okay?

15:36.234 --> 15:38.334
God didn't come down
and talk to me

15:38.334 --> 15:39.767
and tell me to join up.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.167
You want to know who it was?

15:41.167 --> 15:43.767
It was my mother
and Tommy's mother

15:43.767 --> 15:45.534
and my aunts
and my granddads.

15:45.534 --> 15:48.067
They all wanted one of
the Gavin boys to be a priest,

15:48.067 --> 15:49.934
and guess
who bought into that dream.

15:49.934 --> 15:52.000
Me, two decades of my life.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.033
Do yourself a favor,
all right?

15:56.033 --> 15:57.734
Get out
while the getting's good.

15:57.734 --> 15:59.501
Meet a broad.
Bang your brains out.

15:59.501 --> 16:00.601
Have a couple of kids.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.400
Here's an idea.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.434
Get a job where you know
almost for a fact

16:04.434 --> 16:06.367
you're gonna come home
at night.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.434
I know Tommy fills your head
with ideas

16:12.434 --> 16:14.734
about what your father wanted
for you, okay,

16:14.734 --> 16:16.234
but I knew your father too.

16:16.234 --> 16:18.734
He told me
he wanted more for you.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.367
College, cash.

16:20.367 --> 16:23.234
That's why he worked so hard,
to give you a leg up.

16:23.234 --> 16:24.501
Wait. He said that?

16:24.501 --> 16:26.334
Many, many times.

16:26.334 --> 16:27.767
So...so wait.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.133
So Uncle Tommy was lying

16:29.133 --> 16:31.767
when he said that my dad
wanted me to be a firefighter?

16:31.767 --> 16:34.067
Let's say Tommy hears
what Uncle Tommy wants.

16:34.067 --> 16:37.234
Firefighting was a backup plan
in case you didn't want anything

16:37.234 --> 16:39.234
or were too stupid to do
something else.

16:39.234 --> 16:41.767
You can listen to me
and take my advice,

16:41.767 --> 16:43.767
or you can wait 20 years,

16:43.767 --> 16:45.334
but the thing is,
in your work,

16:45.334 --> 16:48.033
there's no guarantee you're
gonna be here in two days,

16:48.033 --> 16:49.501
let alone two decades.

17:04.701 --> 17:06.733
Why didn't you go to Needles
first?

17:06.733 --> 17:09.133
Well, I figured
he'd talk me out of it.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.733
You figured wrong, kid.

17:10.733 --> 17:13.733
I mean, you want to get out,
fine.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.200
It's your decision.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.200
I've been on this job
long enough to know

17:18.200 --> 17:20.367
that youth
is definitely wasted

17:20.367 --> 17:24.367
on the young. Young, dumb,
and full of cum.

17:24.367 --> 17:27.567
But part of my job is to make
sure that guys like you,

17:27.567 --> 17:29.734
young, dumb cum-runners,

17:29.734 --> 17:33.300
don't make so rash a decision
that it'll haunt you later on.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.100
Right.
Well, you know,

17:36.100 --> 17:37.734
I've put a lot of thought
into it.

17:37.734 --> 17:39.434
Yeah. Well, I'm sure
you did.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.033
Put a lot of thought
into this.

17:42.033 --> 17:45.300
You got a prime job
on a prime crew

17:45.300 --> 17:46.901
in a prime house.

17:46.901 --> 17:49.267
Let's say you give that up,
hmm?

17:49.267 --> 17:50.467
Then what happens?

17:50.467 --> 17:52.334
You change your mind
in the next week,

17:52.334 --> 17:54.200
next month, the next year,

17:54.200 --> 17:57.033
there's no sure luck that
this job is still gonna be here.

17:57.033 --> 17:58.767
Then what happens, huh?

17:58.767 --> 18:01.701
You're in a shitty house
on a half-ass crew,

18:01.701 --> 18:02.801
or, worse than that,

18:02.801 --> 18:04.901
you wind up back
on the waiting list.

18:04.901 --> 18:07.734
Then you're jumping through
golden goddamn hula hoops

18:07.734 --> 18:09.901
in some boring office job

18:09.901 --> 18:12.267
because that's what
we're talking about here.

18:12.267 --> 18:13.934
Those are
real possibilities.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.033
I understand.

18:17.033 --> 18:18.467
You're not doing this

18:18.467 --> 18:21.100
because I came down hard on you
the other day, are you?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.734
No. No. I just...

18:23.734 --> 18:25.701
I mean, to be honest,

18:25.701 --> 18:28.267
I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.133
You know, now that I'm here
doing it on a day-to-day basis,

18:31.133 --> 18:34.667
It's like I don't know.
I mean, what do you think?

18:34.667 --> 18:37.033
Am I gonna get less scared

18:37.033 --> 18:40.601
and more courageous
as time goes by?

18:40.601 --> 18:43.033
Let me put it to you
this way.

18:43.033 --> 18:45.400
One time back in Nam,
a buddy of mine,

18:45.400 --> 18:46.767
we were in a ditch.

18:46.767 --> 18:49.534
He's great, Jimmy Bronstein,
nice Jewish kid.

18:49.534 --> 18:52.067
We got, you know,
kind of friendly.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.000
We're in a ditch
looking over the edge.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.400
There's four or five guys
behind us.

18:56.400 --> 19:00.334
Suddenly, Jimmy hollers,
"Grenade!" And I turn around,

19:00.334 --> 19:03.234
and he's diving
on this live grenade

19:03.234 --> 19:07.400
to protect us and me, hmm?

19:08.567 --> 19:11.000
Could you do that,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.801
you know,
for the guys on your crew?

19:12.801 --> 19:15.801
For some homeless junkie
in a fire?

19:15.801 --> 19:19.501
Give up your life
to save them?

19:19.501 --> 19:23.434
Because that's what
this job is all about.

19:23.434 --> 19:25.634
I know. That's...

19:25.634 --> 19:27.501
that's kind of
what I'm worried about.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.601
I'll, uh...

19:35.033 --> 19:37.501
Look.
I'll put your papers in.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.734
May take a couple of weeks.

19:39.734 --> 19:42.100
Meanwhile, um,
get a hold of somebody

19:42.100 --> 19:44.734
to cover for you
on the next couple of tours.

19:44.734 --> 19:46.767
I don't want a guy
whose heart is not in it

19:46.767 --> 19:48.133
riding around on the rig.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.467
Okay?

19:53.467 --> 19:55.601
Okay. Thanks.

19:58.434 --> 20:00.701
Hey, wait.
So that Bronstein guy.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.634
So, uh, he must've gotten blown
into a million bits, huh?

20:03.634 --> 20:05.534
No.
Damn thing never even went off.

20:05.534 --> 20:06.901
It was a dud.

20:06.901 --> 20:11.367
Point is, he jumped
on that thing expecting to die.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.634
Came home
a little bit after me,

20:13.634 --> 20:18.601
got a job as a fireman
out in the Midwest back in '77,

20:18.601 --> 20:19.801
won a medal

20:19.801 --> 20:23.367
for saving a homeless couple
in a warehouse fire.

20:23.367 --> 20:27.033
They lived. He didn't.

20:27.033 --> 20:28.734
That's the point.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.234
What do you want?

20:54.234 --> 20:55.868
Hell of a way
to answer the phone.

20:55.868 --> 20:57.400
What do you want?

20:57.400 --> 20:58.634
I talked to Needles.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.934
I heard about the Damian thing,
and...

21:00.934 --> 21:02.334
If you
try to change his mind

21:02.334 --> 21:04.200
or you make one move
to keep him there,

21:04.200 --> 21:06.567
I swear to Christ I'm gonna take
both your balls

21:06.567 --> 21:08.133
and put them
in a goddamn vise.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.834
Think we tried that once.
I think I remember liking it.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.167
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, okay?

21:13.167 --> 21:16.534
I was calling
to congratulate you.

21:17.601 --> 21:19.934
Liar.
Listen, uh,

21:19.934 --> 21:21.801
I know I promised
to take care of that,

21:21.801 --> 21:23.968
and I know I didn't,
so I apologize for that.

21:23.968 --> 21:25.601
Apology accepted.
What gives?

21:25.601 --> 21:27.667
What? I just called to,
you know...

21:27.667 --> 21:29.400
No. No, you can't.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.467
Neither one of us can
just call each other

21:31.467 --> 21:33.167
without
an ulterior motive.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.868
I mean, that was the basis
of our relationship, right?

21:35.868 --> 21:38.067
Lies and manipulation
and sex

21:38.067 --> 21:40.901
with a side order
of angry threats

21:40.901 --> 21:42.567
and physical danger.

21:42.567 --> 21:47.000
So, what are you
looking for from me?

21:47.000 --> 21:49.968
I, you know...
I'm aware of the fact

21:49.968 --> 21:53.000
that I made
a couple of promises

21:53.000 --> 21:54.601
that I didn't
necessarily keep

21:54.601 --> 21:57.701
and that I sometimes also

21:57.701 --> 22:02.334
took advantage of us,

22:02.334 --> 22:04.968
and, uh,
I guess I'm calling

22:04.968 --> 22:08.634
to make amends for that.

22:11.767 --> 22:14.267
<i>Sheila...</i>

22:14.267 --> 22:16.434
Did you ever love me?

22:16.434 --> 22:19.701
I mean, like,
really love me?

22:19.701 --> 22:21.634
Yes. Of course. Yeah.

22:21.634 --> 22:23.434
Just not enough, I guess.

22:23.434 --> 22:26.200
We both know that...

22:27.434 --> 22:32.367
we were, you know,
haunted by Jimmy...

22:33.801 --> 22:37.234
and, pfft, Janet,

22:37.234 --> 22:41.067
and, you know,
we both know all those times...

22:41.067 --> 22:43.300
Half the time,
I wanted to strangle her,

22:43.300 --> 22:45.334
and the other half,

22:45.334 --> 22:48.167
I don't think
it's any big headline

22:48.167 --> 22:50.734
that, you know, I was still
kind of in love with her.

22:50.734 --> 22:55.701
So I guess
that's the half that won out.

22:55.701 --> 22:57.033
Love/hate.

22:57.033 --> 22:59.133
Yeah, love/hate.

22:59.133 --> 23:00.868
Yeah.
That's how I feel about you.

23:00.868 --> 23:02.234
Fifty-fifty?

23:02.234 --> 23:04.100
No.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.033
One half won out over the other.

23:06.033 --> 23:09.267
Let me guess,
you hate me.

23:09.267 --> 23:12.234
I hate you.

23:12.234 --> 23:14.334
Don't call me anymore.

23:14.334 --> 23:16.501
Come on.
You know I'm gonna call you.

23:16.501 --> 23:19.767
I don't accept
your amends.

23:19.767 --> 23:24.067
I don't grant you absolution,
and I do not forgive you.

23:25.300 --> 23:29.334
I want you to go away
forever.

23:36.701 --> 23:39.634
Goddamn broads. Jesus.

23:44.367 --> 23:47.901
<i>- This is Sheila.
</i>-  <i>You know what to do.</i>

24:02.734 --> 24:03.767
Hey.

24:03.767 --> 24:06.434
Hey.

24:06.434 --> 24:07.467
What's going on?

24:07.467 --> 24:09.267
Not much.

24:09.267 --> 24:10.901
It was a long day for you,
huh?

24:10.901 --> 24:12.934
Yeah.

24:16.067 --> 24:19.667
Traffic on the bridge
was a bitch.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.968
Um, where is everybody?

24:22.968 --> 24:24.367
Well, the baby is asleep,

24:24.367 --> 24:27.968
and Katy and Colleen
have gone to Shawn's.

24:27.968 --> 24:30.100
So we have
the place to ourselves.

24:30.100 --> 24:32.400
Mm-hmm.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.501
Why did you love
to drink so much?

24:37.501 --> 24:38.601
What?

24:38.601 --> 24:40.467
Look, I'm not trying
to pick a fight.

24:40.467 --> 24:44.067
I just wanna know
the real reasons why,

24:44.067 --> 24:45.801
okay, no bullshit.

24:45.801 --> 24:48.601
I liked it.
You know, it was... I liked it.

24:48.601 --> 24:50.334
Okay. No.
That's not good enough.

24:50.334 --> 24:52.000
And don't say
that it's a disease

24:52.000 --> 24:54.434
because that would qualify
as bullshit now.

24:54.434 --> 24:56.801
No. Please just
help me to understand

24:56.801 --> 25:00.968
why you preferred it to me
and to the kids.

25:00.968 --> 25:02.400
It is a disease.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.467
I don't know.
I mean, I just did.

25:06.467 --> 25:08.501
I don't drink anymore, so,
ahem...

25:08.501 --> 25:09.734
How did it make you feel?

25:09.734 --> 25:12.934
It made me feel better.

25:12.934 --> 25:14.167
How specifically?

25:14.167 --> 25:18.000
Because when things
were shitty,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.767
I could have five or six

25:19.767 --> 25:23.801
or ten vodkas or whiskeys,
whatever,

25:23.801 --> 25:27.767
and, you know,
I felt like

25:27.767 --> 25:30.300
I was right
and you were wrong.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.534
Everybody else was wrong,
you know?

25:32.534 --> 25:36.434
It made me feel, like, uh,
I don't know...

25:36.434 --> 25:38.567
Great.

25:41.267 --> 25:44.734
Well, anyways,
those days are over and...

25:46.667 --> 25:48.934
Thank God, right?

25:58.367 --> 26:02.734
You can have either or both,
one last round,

26:02.734 --> 26:05.067
and I will never
tell a soul.

26:08.767 --> 26:12.300
Midleton special reserve,
which I know you love,

26:12.300 --> 26:13.901
and this is a nice glass

26:13.901 --> 26:18.601
of vodka called 42 Below,
distilled five times.

26:18.601 --> 26:20.734
So it's up to you.

26:20.734 --> 26:22.234
What's up to me?

26:22.234 --> 26:27.767
A sip each, a glass,
both glasses.

26:27.767 --> 26:31.234
Okay? It's the last call, Tommy,
and no one will know.

26:35.133 --> 26:38.467
All right.
What's the, uh...

26:38.467 --> 26:39.767
What's the deal?

26:39.767 --> 26:41.367
There's no deal.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.801
I tell you what.
I will even drink one of those,

26:44.801 --> 26:46.267
and then you drink
the other.

26:46.267 --> 26:48.400
Oh, come on.
It'll be like old times.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.501
We have a couple of cocktails,
and then we get it on.

26:52.634 --> 26:54.467
So we're gonna
have this...

26:54.467 --> 26:57.100
And then we have that.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.868
Okay.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.667
So which one
do you want?

27:01.667 --> 27:04.467
This has always been
my favorite,

27:04.467 --> 27:07.934
and this is the best whiskey
I ever had.

27:07.934 --> 27:14.300
It's like brown velvet.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.434
I mean, look at that.
It's beautiful.

27:18.434 --> 27:23.734
But I know you're not gonna
finish all of that,

27:23.734 --> 27:26.000
I'm assuming.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.200
It's probably better
if we're both on the same page

27:30.200 --> 27:31.734
if we're gonna
do this, right?

27:31.734 --> 27:33.000
All right.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.234
So, what's it gonna be?

27:38.367 --> 27:40.767
I will go...

27:48.501 --> 27:49.501
Hmm.

27:56.601 --> 27:58.534
And...

28:02.567 --> 28:04.801
What do you think
of that?

28:07.033 --> 28:09.634
I needed to know.

28:09.634 --> 28:12.200
Yeah. It's not...
I wouldn't have.

28:14.367 --> 28:17.267
Look, Tommy.

28:17.267 --> 28:19.667
There are no explanations
or apologies needed

28:19.667 --> 28:21.000
from either one of us.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.534
Okay, and if you wanna
make amends to other people,

28:23.534 --> 28:25.234
that's fine.

28:25.234 --> 28:26.968
But as far as
I'm concerned,

28:26.968 --> 28:28.467
that was my final test.

28:28.467 --> 28:32.601
So from now on,
a fresh start, okay?

28:32.601 --> 28:36.534
No booze, no grudges,
and no Sheila.

28:36.534 --> 28:40.567
Right. Got it.

28:40.567 --> 28:42.767
And there is
one more thing.

28:44.033 --> 28:46.300
Damian
is not your actual son.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.367
He's your godson.

28:47.367 --> 28:48.567
I know.

28:48.567 --> 28:51.267
Okay, so if you wanna
make amends with someone,

28:51.267 --> 28:52.667
start with Katy.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.467
She's almost out the door.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.467
And then Wyatt, okay,

28:58.467 --> 29:01.133
because you're working
with a clean slate.

29:06.334 --> 29:08.000
We were thinking,
like a bike

29:08.000 --> 29:09.634
or a jogging path
in Pat's name

29:09.634 --> 29:12.133
or, you know, something
in a park or something.

29:12.133 --> 29:14.601
Yo, thinking small potatoes,
son.

29:14.601 --> 29:16.234
You wanna pay tribute
to the man,

29:16.234 --> 29:17.734
you gotta think big potatoes.

29:17.734 --> 29:21.167
Like, get him a,
um, a tunnel,

29:21.167 --> 29:23.734
you know, or a highway
in his name, you know,

29:23.734 --> 29:26.234
uh, Pat Mahoney bridge.

29:26.234 --> 29:27.567
Now, that shit sings, man.

29:27.567 --> 29:28.734
That's a bad idea,
son.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.033
You don't want nothing
with transportation.

29:31.033 --> 29:33.934
Trust me on that. People will be
in cars, cursing his name.

29:33.934 --> 29:36.067
Traffic on the
Patrick Mahoney's a bitch.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.767
Like, you know,
when they changed

29:37.767 --> 29:39.300
the Triborough
to RFK bridge,

29:39.300 --> 29:41.601
I swear to God they
might as well have dug him up

29:41.601 --> 29:42.701
and shot him again.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.968
Hit me. Thanks.

29:44.968 --> 29:47.501
You know, Mike,
I hate to say it, man,

29:47.501 --> 29:49.567
but, uh, you know, not every guy

29:49.567 --> 29:51.968
who meets an untimely end
on his gig

29:51.968 --> 29:53.634
gets a public dedication,
bro.

29:53.634 --> 29:56.300
But if we get something
dedicated with his name on it,

29:56.300 --> 29:58.901
it makes a statement
to the F.D.N.Y. and the public,

29:58.901 --> 30:01.534
maybe helps the government
get its head out of its ass

30:01.534 --> 30:04.400
so it coughs up the cheese
to help treat first responders.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.801
Yeah. Well, you know me, man.

30:05.801 --> 30:08.100
I'm all over that,
I applaud your intentions,

30:08.100 --> 30:09.634
but how you gonna pull this off?

30:09.634 --> 30:11.334
You and Gary ain't
a brain trust...

30:11.334 --> 30:14.334
Yeah, well, Pat's mom, she works
for parks and recreations,

30:14.334 --> 30:16.767
and she happens to think
she can help us swing it.

30:16.767 --> 30:19.400
Better to know someone
than something, I guess.

30:19.400 --> 30:23.634
Gentlemens, have you perchance
saved me any hot water?

30:23.634 --> 30:25.501
Yo, Hef, what's up
with the robe, man?

30:25.501 --> 30:27.968
What? What are you talking
about, this old thing?

30:27.968 --> 30:30.834
Check it out, huh?
Pretty sweet.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.767
No man should
ever wear a robe ever.

30:32.767 --> 30:34.834
Especially in the presence
of other men.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.667
How about in a spa?
Spa is all right,

30:36.667 --> 30:39.601
because if you're in a spa,
you're not a man, so it's cool.

30:39.601 --> 30:41.367
It was getting drafty
in here.

30:41.367 --> 30:43.033
I decided to take action.

30:43.033 --> 30:44.634
You look like
a mental patient.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.267
It's freezing. How can you not
feel that? Look at you.

30:47.267 --> 30:49.968
Your nipples are popping
like frozen Hershey kisses.

30:49.968 --> 30:52.167
Let's not talk about
my nipples, all right?

30:52.167 --> 30:54.300
It's not just yours.
It's you too. And you.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.667
Look at those. You could carve
your name with those puppies.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.067
We're all nipping, boys,
like Denise Richards

31:00.067 --> 31:02.434
ice fishing without a sweater.

31:02.434 --> 31:04.400
Goddamn, Garrity.
What?

31:04.400 --> 31:06.133
Our nipples might be popping,

31:06.133 --> 31:08.000
but your dick has disappeared
in you

31:08.000 --> 31:09.968
like a frightened,
little turtle.

31:09.968 --> 31:12.734
You know what? That's not funny.
I just said it was cold.

31:12.734 --> 31:14.734
It ain't that cold.
No. It ain't.

31:14.734 --> 31:16.634
Take it. Take it.

31:16.634 --> 31:18.100
- Take this?
- Come on.

31:43.567 --> 31:47.033
So that's where you keep that?
Jesus, you're jumpy.

31:47.033 --> 31:48.868
I didn't hear you coming.

31:48.868 --> 31:52.200
Stealth, baby. Stealth.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.734
So, what, you're not gonna
say anything?

32:03.734 --> 32:05.100
About what?

32:05.100 --> 32:06.567
You didn't talk to Feinberg?

32:06.567 --> 32:09.100
Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. No.
I talked to Needles.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.267
And?

32:10.267 --> 32:13.701
What? You know,
it is what it is.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.567
Jesus Christ,
look at this thing.

32:19.567 --> 32:22.567
Could be
on its last legs.

32:25.167 --> 32:28.701
You know they don't even
make this model anymore?

32:28.701 --> 32:31.267
Twenty-two years
I've had this.

32:33.367 --> 32:37.200
I remember, uh, the first year
I was out with your old man

32:37.200 --> 32:40.434
and, uh, we got a call,
I jumped on the rig.

32:40.434 --> 32:43.901
Halfway there to the job,
there's no helmet.

32:43.901 --> 32:46.300
You know, I keep my helmet
in the rig like I do now.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.701
I did it from the beginning.

32:47.701 --> 32:50.067
Thing ain't there,
you know.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.234
On the way back from that job,
I'm thinking.

32:52.234 --> 32:54.100
"Okay. Where did I leave it?"

32:54.100 --> 32:56.968
I remember. I left it
on the front bumper of the rig.

32:56.968 --> 33:00.100
So that means
it's on the block somewhere.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.033
I go up and down
the whole block,

33:02.033 --> 33:04.501
under every parked car.
I can't find it, you know?

33:04.501 --> 33:06.367
I'm freaking out,
and I came back.

33:06.367 --> 33:08.767
I actually
got a magic marker

33:08.767 --> 33:10.667
and made leaflets

33:10.667 --> 33:12.667
and put them up
in the neighborhood.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.968
You know what I mean?
I offered a $100 reward.

33:14.968 --> 33:17.601
So two days go by.

33:17.601 --> 33:22.567
Third day, homeless guy
walks in with this in his hand.

33:22.567 --> 33:26.167
I gave him the 100 bucks,
and off we go.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.701
Lucky break.
No.

33:29.701 --> 33:32.667
Your old man
found it on the bumper

33:32.667 --> 33:34.100
and had it the whole time.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.200
He was just...
You know?

33:36.200 --> 33:40.067
I don't know. You laugh.

33:40.067 --> 33:42.667
That's the shit I'm gonna miss
when I walk,

33:42.667 --> 33:45.300
you know,
the ball busting.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.434
So what you're saying...

33:49.434 --> 33:52.300
You're saying
you want me to stay?

33:52.300 --> 33:56.767
No, no, no.
I'm not saying that. No.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.534
I think I've gotten
into trouble

33:58.534 --> 34:01.834
with this
particular situation.

34:01.834 --> 34:04.567
You know,
it's up to you.

34:04.567 --> 34:06.367
Really is.

34:08.266 --> 34:11.000
You know, if I were your age
coming in now,

34:11.000 --> 34:14.266
with all the politically
correct bullshit after 9/11,

34:14.266 --> 34:16.333
guys are worried about
promotions

34:16.333 --> 34:17.534
and covering their ass

34:17.534 --> 34:18.734
and all the paperwork

34:18.734 --> 34:21.167
and extra rules
and regulations...

34:21.167 --> 34:22.900
I don't know, man.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.567
When me
and your old man came in,

34:24.567 --> 34:27.634
we fought fires,
we saved people,

34:27.634 --> 34:29.100
and in between jobs,

34:29.100 --> 34:31.734
we just did basically
whatever the hell we wanted to,

34:31.734 --> 34:34.667
you know? That was it.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.132
That's gonna have
to be your call.

34:37.132 --> 34:38.766
I'll tell you one thing,
though.

34:39.934 --> 34:41.501
I gotta take a huge shit.

35:00.534 --> 35:01.634
What the hell?

35:01.634 --> 35:04.868
<i>Burn in hell, Damian.</i>

35:04.868 --> 35:06.868
<i>Touch me where I stink.</i>

35:09.133 --> 35:11.901
<i>When you saved me in the fire,</i>
<i>I think I pissed my pants.</i>

35:11.901 --> 35:13.501
Oh, what?

35:13.501 --> 35:16.334
<i>Welcometo the
hero club,</i> <i>Frimiscus.</i>

35:19.667 --> 35:21.334
Yeah.

35:21.334 --> 35:23.767
It's real piss.
Ugh.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.501
Du... Uh...

35:28.400 --> 35:29.634
Ugh.

35:34.267 --> 35:35.267
Hey.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.634
What's up, kid?

35:36.634 --> 35:38.968
So I had a change of heart.

35:38.968 --> 35:40.267
What do you mean?

35:40.267 --> 35:41.801
About my papers,

35:43.067 --> 35:45.834
About leaving.
Leaving?

35:45.834 --> 35:48.367
Yeah. You know, there was
your whole grenade story

35:48.367 --> 35:51.767
and some other stuff.
Anyway, I changed my mind.

35:51.767 --> 35:53.934
Right.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.667
Wait. You, uh, you didn't
tell anybody yet, did you?

35:56.667 --> 35:58.734
Only me.

35:58.734 --> 36:00.634
Told you he'd be back.

36:00.634 --> 36:03.334
Listen, kid. This job
is balls out or no balls at all.

36:03.334 --> 36:04.968
I sense
you're not in that game,

36:04.968 --> 36:06.901
I'll pull you off
myself, understand?

36:06.901 --> 36:08.501
Yes. Balls to the wall.
Got it.

36:08.501 --> 36:11.033
Now get out of here.
All right.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.734
You still got his papers?

36:12.734 --> 36:16.033
I'm sure I do.
Forgot where I put them.

36:16.033 --> 36:18.334
Where the hell did I put them,
right over here?

36:18.334 --> 36:21.701
Hey, wait a minute.
Let me look-see. No, no, no.

36:21.701 --> 36:22.868
I just...

36:22.868 --> 36:24.734
Wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

36:29.534 --> 36:30.767
They're right here.

36:30.767 --> 36:34.234
Oh. Thanks.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.567
You sure you're all right?

36:38.334 --> 36:39.767
Yeah. Sure.

36:45.267 --> 36:46.834
Hey, chief, you got a sec?

36:46.834 --> 36:50.133
Whenever you call me chief, it's
always official house business.

36:50.133 --> 36:52.200
This about the kid?
What about the kid?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.801
His toes are getting frosty.

36:53.801 --> 36:55.901
He quit?
Eh, he'll be alright.

36:55.901 --> 36:56.968
You know the new kids.

36:56.968 --> 36:58.901
First sign of trouble,
balls shrivel.

36:58.901 --> 37:00.434
He'll thicken up
his hide.

37:00.434 --> 37:02.334
He'll be fine.
What's up with you?

37:02.334 --> 37:04.667
With what?
What do you wanna talk about?

37:04.667 --> 37:07.000
Nothing.
"Hey, chief."

37:07.000 --> 37:09.767
What do you wanna talk about?
Gonna ask you something.

37:09.767 --> 37:12.300
Jesus, I had it top of my head,
I can't remember.

37:12.300 --> 37:14.534
Sorry. I'll think of it.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.234
There's something
going around here.

37:30.467 --> 37:33.100
It looks like it's confined
to the second floor,

37:33.100 --> 37:34.267
explosion number two.

37:34.267 --> 37:36.267
Lou, pop the lock
and run a sweep for me.

37:36.267 --> 37:38.267
- Frankie, getting a saw?
- Yeah.

37:38.267 --> 37:40.334
Bobby,
drop me a second line.

37:40.334 --> 37:43.501
Stay alert. This is an abandoned
warehouse we're dealing with.

37:43.501 --> 37:45.100
Do me a favor.
Keep an eye on Lou.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.868
What's wrong?
He's acting funny.

37:46.868 --> 37:49.567
Lou is a funny guy.
Not ha-ha funny, weird funny.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.968
All right.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.534
Whoa, whoa...
Hey, kid, you with us?

37:55.534 --> 37:56.601
Hundred percent.

37:56.601 --> 37:58.467
All right. Go get them.

38:09.434 --> 38:11.601
- Holy Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

38:11.601 --> 38:14.734
- What is this place?
- A goddamn coffin factory.

38:14.734 --> 38:17.667
- The bright side.
- If this fire goes to shit and we die,

38:17.667 --> 38:19.200
they won't have
to take us far.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.767
Talk about a bad omen.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.367
All right. Frankie, Mike,
you guys go deep.

38:23.367 --> 38:26.167
Uh, Tommy and Damian,
take the second floor.

38:26.167 --> 38:28.834
Sean-o, you and I
vent up top. Come on.

38:32.367 --> 38:33.968
You all right?
Put your mask on.

38:33.968 --> 38:36.434
I'm fine.
Just do a sweep.

38:36.434 --> 38:37.901
Chief,
we need water up here.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.934
All the hydrants are frozen,
Lou.

38:39.934 --> 38:41.367
We're going to plan B.

38:41.367 --> 38:43.501
What's plan B?

38:43.501 --> 38:45.100
We're still
figuring that out.

38:46.234 --> 38:48.300
Well, hurry up.
Things are getting ugly.

38:49.701 --> 38:52.267
Hey, are you okay?
Lou.

38:52.267 --> 38:54.667
Shut up, will you,
and do your search.

38:56.567 --> 38:59.934
Oh, God.
Oh, goddamn it.

38:59.934 --> 39:02.367
Lou, hey, come on.
I'm getting worried. Lou.

39:06.067 --> 39:07.434
Lou, what are you doing?

39:07.434 --> 39:09.467
Hey, hey, hey, Ken,
what are you doing?

39:09.467 --> 39:10.968
You can't vent without a hose.

39:10.968 --> 39:12.300
I can't goddamn breathe.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.534
Lou, I told you not to vent,
we got no water down here.

39:15.534 --> 39:18.133
Shawn, call in a second alarm.
We're losing this.

39:18.133 --> 39:21.033
Son of a bitch. Bobby,
go find me another hydrant.

39:21.033 --> 39:22.434
Let's get out of here.

39:22.434 --> 39:24.400
Yeah. Just go. Go, go, go, go.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.901
<i>Tommy, we're
hot on three,</i> <i>no bodies.</i>

39:32.901 --> 39:34.434
<i>You have anything</i>
<i>down there?</i>

39:34.434 --> 39:36.834
All clear here.
What's the story with the water?

39:36.834 --> 39:39.734
<i>- We ain't waiting.
- You</i> <i>and Damiango down the stairs.</i>

39:39.734 --> 39:42.100
<i>- Meet us on the ground floor.</i> 
- All right.

39:46.767 --> 39:47.834
Let's go.

39:50.701 --> 39:53.267
UK, you gotta get
out of there right now.

39:54.701 --> 39:56.234
Trying to find an exit,
chief.

39:56.234 --> 39:57.868
The rear is all sealed.

39:57.868 --> 39:59.133
I got a ladder on the roof,

39:59.133 --> 40:01.400
but it doesn't look like
you have access.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.334
You have to come out
the way you went in.

40:03.334 --> 40:04.834
That's a hot gauntlet
to run.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.334
We got no choice. I'll give you
all the water I can.

40:07.334 --> 40:09.267
Keep your heads down,
double-time it,

40:09.267 --> 40:10.667
<i>and get your asses</i>
<i>out here.</i>

40:10.667 --> 40:12.267
<i>Don't make me wait.</i>

40:12.267 --> 40:15.434
Okay. Lace them up, boys.
It's <i>Logan's Run</i> time.

40:15.434 --> 40:16.901
Franco, you go first.

40:16.901 --> 40:18.701
Stick together, guys.

40:18.701 --> 40:20.801
Keep your heads down.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.033
Lou?

40:42.133 --> 40:45.033
- Guys, come on. Get out of here.
- You get out of here.

40:45.033 --> 40:48.434
You go. Go. Yes.

40:48.434 --> 40:50.801
Lou. Lou.
Guys, now pick that up.

40:50.801 --> 40:53.300
- Mayday! Mayday!
- 62 truck to battalion.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.300
We got a guy trapped.

40:55.667 --> 40:58.334
We gotta go! Come on!

40:58.334 --> 41:00.334
We gotta go! Come on!

41:00.334 --> 41:02.000
Help him out!
Help him out!

41:02.000 --> 41:04.067
Come on, guys!
We gotta go!
