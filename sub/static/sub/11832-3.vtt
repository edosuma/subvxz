Previously, on "The Practice"...

Anderson Pearson,
my stuffed shirt professor,

00:04.290 --> 00:06.230
he just shot somebody dead.

00:06.230 --> 00:09.190
- I'd like to go self-defense.
- The man was unarmed.

00:09.190 --> 00:11.260
- In talking to your wife,
you two felt like this man

00:11.260 --> 00:13.230
might end up
hurting you one day.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.270
- But we weren't at that point
when your client shot him.

00:16.270 --> 00:19.210
You don't want
to be arguing self-defense.

00:19.210 --> 00:20.310
- You can't limit our defense--

00:20.310 --> 00:24.240
- I can refuse an instruction,
Ms. Dole.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.290
- Do you think you were acting
in self-defense

00:26.290 --> 00:29.330
or do you think you
involuntarily

00:29.330 --> 00:33.190
just started squeezing?

00:33.190 --> 00:36.240
- I don't remember
pulling the trigger.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.390

00:43.390 --> 00:46.200

Spoke to him for an hour
on the phone last night.

00:47.370 --> 00:49.250

00:49.250 --> 00:51.230
I was so nervous
about meeting you.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.260

because of his looks.

00:53.260 --> 00:55.310
- It just wasn't there,
Rebecca, the chemistry.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.260

here over a broken date.

She's not pretty.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.170
- I've decided
to drop the lawsuit.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.350
I wish you well in life,
Ellenor.

01:07.350 --> 01:09.390

01:53.320 --> 01:55.240
a Harvard professor
commits murder.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.310
- He didn't commit murder.

the gun just went off

01:57.360 --> 01:59.290

It's just the circumstances
that vary.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.330
- Oh, there's a proverb.

02:06.330 --> 02:09.280
- How much time
are we talking about?

02:09.280 --> 02:12.270
- 4 years.
- 4 years?

02:12.270 --> 02:13.390

a point of no return--

09:30.300 --> 09:32.290
Look, certain things
may not be privileged

09:32.290 --> 09:33.390
and it is possible
that we are going to have

09:33.390 --> 09:35.340
to report this to the police.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.320
- What if they think
I killed her?

09:37.320 --> 09:39.290
- You don't know if the body's
been discovered yet.

09:39.290 --> 09:41.210
- No!
I don't know anything.

09:41.210 --> 09:43.270
- Now, George,
I want you to listen to me,

09:43.270 --> 09:45.190
and this is privileged,

09:45.190 --> 09:48.330
what we do next is very,
very tricky.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.260
If we march
into that police station

09:50.260 --> 09:53.280
with this woman's head,
you are going to be a suspect.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.320
And if you did it,
I hesitate to offer you up,

09:55.320 --> 09:58.220
since they are likely going
to find much more evidence,

09:58.220 --> 09:59.360
and if you didn't do it,

09:59.360 --> 10:02.370
it is my instinct that we start
cooperating immediately.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.270
So, for your sake, George,

10:04.270 --> 10:07.180
I want you to come clean
with us right now,

10:07.180 --> 10:10.230
are you involved
in this woman's death?

10:10.230 --> 10:12.200
- No.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.230
I swear to you, Ellenor.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.190
No.

10:16.190 --> 10:20.170
<i>♪ ♪</i>

10:24.270 --> 10:25.340
- Just hold on.
I don't think that

10:25.340 --> 10:27.310
calling the police is
the right thing.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.220
- Well, what if we don't
and he's eventually picked up?

10:29.220 --> 10:31.190
By not going forward, he makes
himself more suspicious.

10:31.190 --> 10:32.330
- Uh, excuse me.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.200
Wouldn't he be tapped out
on suspiciousness?

10:34.200 --> 10:35.290
He's got the victim
from the neck up.

10:35.290 --> 10:36.380
Okay, could you could just
get the phones?

10:36.380 --> 10:38.250
- Ellenor, we got
to talk about this.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.350
- How long
before it'll start to stink?

10:39.350 --> 10:41.210
- Lucy.
- Would you be quiet?

10:41.210 --> 10:42.350
- Look, we got
to make a call here.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.210
- Yes, we do.
I don't think we're under

10:44.210 --> 10:46.200
any legal obligation
to notify the police

10:46.200 --> 10:48.190
and if we advise
this man to do that,

10:48.190 --> 10:49.270
it could be malpractice.
Especially--

10:49.270 --> 10:51.240
- Malpractice?
- If he gets arrested,

10:51.240 --> 10:52.400
goes to jail,
based on our counsel--

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
- I agree,
we got to be careful here.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.280
- Why don't you just
tell them where the body is?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.170
You can hold the head
back as leverage.

10:58.170 --> 11:00.250
- Lucy, I'd appreciate
you staying out of this.

11:00.250 --> 11:01.380
- Look, this man is gonna
have a coronary in there.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.360
- Can I make a suggestion?

11:03.360 --> 11:05.390
I'm meeting with
Professor Pearson in 20 minutes.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.300
He teaches legal ethics.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.260
The bar consults him
on this kind of stuff.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.180
Let me ask him
what we should do.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.400
- We can't share privileged
information with a man--

11:12.400 --> 11:14.360
- If I consults him as a lawyer,
privilege extends to him.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.360
Whatever we advise this guy,
it's probably smart

11:16.360 --> 11:18.300
to get an outside opinion
anyway, to cover us.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.170
- Meet with him.
Meanwhile, I'm off to meet

11:20.170 --> 11:22.190
with the psychiatrist
of the guy he shot.

11:22.190 --> 11:24.310
- Should I be sending out
for some ice?

11:24.310 --> 11:26.280
[door closes]

11:26.280 --> 11:29.380
- The photocopies he made were
all on skull fractures,

11:29.380 --> 11:32.210
specifically
to the back of the head.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.190
- And what else did you find?

11:34.190 --> 11:36.250
- Well, we found
this piece of wood.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.360
Exhibit 21.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.340
- Now,
why is this significant?

11:40.340 --> 11:44.260
- He made that kitchen table
about six months ago.

11:44.260 --> 11:47.320
Same material,
same finish as this.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.180
Now, if you look
at his little storyboard,

11:51.180 --> 11:53.360
you see that,
uh, he has the woman

11:53.360 --> 11:55.390
falling off her stool,

11:55.390 --> 11:59.180
her head hitting
the edge of the table,

11:59.180 --> 12:01.380
fatally fracturing her skull.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.240
Well, our theory is:

12:04.240 --> 12:05.340
that he planned to hit
the woman

12:05.340 --> 12:07.290
from behind with this.

12:07.290 --> 12:09.310
That way, any wood fragments
found on her

12:09.310 --> 12:12.340
would appear to have come
from the kitchen table.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.340
- This was pretty well
thought out.

12:14.340 --> 12:16.280
- Oh, yes.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.280
- Now, Detective, you also
found this man's journal.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.380
- Yes. After getting a warrant,
we searched the premises

12:22.380 --> 12:25.370
and located a journal containing
entries in his handwriting.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.280
- Okay, I'm gonna ask you to
read some of

12:27.280 --> 12:29.210
those entries in a second,
but first,

12:29.210 --> 12:32.170
could you
give us a brief summary?

12:32.170 --> 12:35.250
- He describes,
in minute detail,

12:35.250 --> 12:37.400
his plan to murder his wife.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.320
- Okay, let's start with...
June 14, 1998.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.170
This clipped page right here,

12:44.170 --> 12:45.300
could you please read
that for us?

12:45.300 --> 12:46.370
- Yes.

12:46.370 --> 12:49.210
"Even the coffee
smells better knowing

12:49.210 --> 12:51.350
"that soon I'll be able
to drink it alone.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.230
"I feel sanguine.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.190
"Maybe it's a feeling
that her death

12:55.190 --> 12:57.320
"will make the world
a more peaceful place.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.400
For sure,
my world will get better."

13:01.400 --> 13:04.320
- Good writing.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.320
[door buzzes]
- Bobby's meeting

13:07.320 --> 13:09.310
with the guy's shrink
as we speak.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.300
Good news is this was
court-ordered

13:11.300 --> 13:12.390
impulse control therapy.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.350
He has a history
of road rage and assaults.

13:14.350 --> 13:17.360
That's actually great news.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.400
- We're still set for
a trial in three weeks?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.330
- Yes.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.350
We're meeting with some firearms
experts today, as well.

13:22.350 --> 13:24.270
I'll let you how that goes.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.340
Now, it's pretty obvious,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.210
to convince the jury

13:29.210 --> 13:32.300
that you involuntarily
pulled the trigger,

13:32.300 --> 13:35.200
you're gonna have to testify.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.230
- Of course.

13:38.230 --> 13:41.370
- Is there any skeleton
we need to know about?

13:41.370 --> 13:43.280
- No.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.310
- I want you to keep
asking yourself that question.

13:45.310 --> 13:47.220
Anything.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.290
An old girlfriend in high school
who says you hit her,

13:48.290 --> 13:50.200
screaming at an umpire
or a coach

13:50.200 --> 13:52.170
at your kid's
little league game, whatever.

13:52.170 --> 13:54.240
Anything you can think of
that the DA

13:54.240 --> 13:58.310
might cross you with,
we got to know about it.

13:58.310 --> 14:01.190
- I think I'm pretty clean,
Lindsay.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.320
- Okay.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.380
You holding up okay?
- Oh...

14:10.380 --> 14:12.330
[clears throat]
Well, I've been better,

14:12.330 --> 14:15.380
but...
[chuckles]

14:15.380 --> 14:17.230
- Listen, on another matter,

14:17.230 --> 14:18.330
I'd like to consult you
on a case

14:18.330 --> 14:21.360
my firm is handling.
- Oh.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.280
- A client has come
into our office,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.290
apparently framed for a murder
he didn't commit,

14:25.290 --> 14:27.310
and, in--in the course of
attorney-client communication,

14:27.310 --> 14:30.250
he opened a bag revealing
the victim's severed head.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.380
Now,
do we have any formal duty

14:31.380 --> 14:33.310
to tell the police
that a murder has occurred,

14:33.310 --> 14:35.230
or, in--in the alternative,

14:35.230 --> 14:38.210
that we have knowledge
of the head's whereabouts?

14:40.330 --> 14:44.170
- Things I learn in therapy,
they're privileged.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.360
Surely you appreciate that.
- I do,

14:45.360 --> 14:47.330
but that privilege
doesn't survive the patient.

14:47.330 --> 14:49.360
- Well, I like my patients
to feel that

14:49.360 --> 14:51.230
should I outlive them,

14:51.230 --> 14:52.340
I won't be violating
their confidence--

14:52.340 --> 14:59.220
- This case involves a murder,
Doctor.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.370
- I'm happy
to stipulate by affidavit

15:01.370 --> 15:04.390
that Mr. Breyer was diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic,

15:04.390 --> 15:06.220
with a propensity
towards violence.

15:06.220 --> 15:07.350
- I appreciate that,
but...

15:07.350 --> 15:11.270
you see, my client
is--is charged with a homicide.

15:11.270 --> 15:14.380
Affidavits don't play well
dramatically in a courtroom.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.370
I really need your testimony.

15:16.370 --> 15:18.330
- [scoffs]
I can't give you that.

15:18.330 --> 15:20.280
- I could to subpoena you,
in which case you'd have to--

15:20.280 --> 15:22.330
- Well, I certainly don't think
you'd want to do that.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.400
My demeanor might not
favor your defense.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.300
- Well, certainly,
you would tell the truth?

15:26.300 --> 15:30.360
- Yes, but, remember,
your client murdered mine.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.230
A bias on my part
would be understandable.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.280
- You know,
I'm really confused here,

15:35.280 --> 15:38.390
is it that testifying
would be an inconvenience?

15:38.390 --> 15:40.390
- I don't like the idea

15:40.390 --> 15:42.350
of doctors being brought
into court

15:42.350 --> 15:45.200
to give testimony
against their patients.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.260
If the people
who come through my door

15:47.260 --> 15:49.190
have to worry about
whether I'm going to reveal

15:49.190 --> 15:50.340
what they say,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.380
that can only have a chilling
effect on their therapy.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.270
- Well, you're looking
at a big picture,

15:54.270 --> 15:55.370
I'm dealing with a small one,

15:55.370 --> 15:57.250
my client's life

15:57.250 --> 15:59.210
and where he gets to spend
the rest of it.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.270
- I sympathize
with your problem,

16:00.270 --> 16:03.210
but, uh, it's not mine.

16:05.210 --> 16:09.310
- Well, I'll make it yours...
if I have to.

16:09.310 --> 16:12.260
- I'm sorry?
- We'll get your records.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.220
Records which will very likely

16:14.220 --> 16:16.390
reveal Mr. Breyer's contempt
for Mr. Pearson,

16:16.390 --> 16:19.280
and there's probably
a few threats in there.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.190
If a psychiatrist
has knowledge

16:21.190 --> 16:23.400
that his client
is about to commit bodily harm

16:23.400 --> 16:25.330
and he stays silent?

16:25.330 --> 16:28.240
- My client did not commit
bodily harm. Yours did.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.390
- Which you
may have played a role in

16:29.390 --> 16:32.250
by not intervening.
- Oh, good-bye, Mr. Donnell.

16:32.250 --> 16:35.200
- Dr. Matthews.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.370
Violence happened here.

16:37.370 --> 16:40.260
Somebody died.

16:40.260 --> 16:44.380
If you had reason
to see this violence coming,

16:44.380 --> 16:48.200
you could be exposed.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.360
Now, you want to read that
as a threat?

16:52.360 --> 16:55.310
Feel completely free.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.210
- Obviously, I was shocked.

17:03.210 --> 17:05.250
I still am.

17:05.250 --> 17:08.270
My father,
about to kill my mother?

17:08.270 --> 17:10.200
I still can't believe it.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.170
- Josh, you love your dad;
do you not?

17:13.170 --> 17:14.319
- Very, very much.

17:14.319 --> 17:18.180
- And would you
consider yourself close to him?

17:18.180 --> 17:20.329
- Yes.
- I object to this.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.400
I don't see the point.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.329
- Your Honor, the point--

17:23.329 --> 17:24.400
I'm simply trying to show

17:24.400 --> 17:27.250
that this is not some
family split

17:27.250 --> 17:28.380
where people are taking sides.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.360
The witness is very devoted
to the defendant.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.260
- Why do we need a witness
to say all this

17:33.260 --> 17:35.220
when you seem happy
to say it yourself?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.200
- All right.
- Sidebar, Your Honor.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.340
This witness isn't up here
to offer anything new.

17:44.340 --> 17:47.210
She put him up to get in
that he thought his father

17:47.210 --> 17:49.210
was gonna kill his mother--
good try--

17:49.210 --> 17:50.360
but what he believes
isn't relevant,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.400
unless he's got some foundation
as a mind reader.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.330
- He's got foundation
as his son, and his beliefs--

17:55.330 --> 17:57.280
- Isn't relevant,
what he believes.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.320
Can't be introduced
as evidence.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.280
- Ms. Ward, he's right.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.340
- Your Honor,
I'm simply trying to establish--

18:03.340 --> 18:05.360
- I know what you're trying
to establish.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.170
If his own son thinks so,
it must be true.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.390
No go.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.380
- Josh, did it hurt

18:19.380 --> 18:22.210
to turn your own father in
for attempted murder?

18:22.210 --> 18:24.220
- Objection.
- Offered to show lack of bias.

18:24.220 --> 18:26.310
- Objection overruled.

18:26.310 --> 18:28.280
- Did it hurt?

18:28.280 --> 18:31.170
- Of course it did.

18:31.170 --> 18:33.280
- Thank you, sir.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.260
That's all.

of not being tough enough.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.180
- I did?

42:18.180 --> 42:20.360
- You thought I might be looking
for approval in his eyes.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.310
And you were right.

42:24.310 --> 42:25.400
I mean, every time
I've looked at this firm

42:25.400 --> 42:28.240
through his eyes,
I've felt--

42:28.240 --> 42:31.180
I don't know,
I--

42:31.180 --> 42:33.260
I mean, sleazy isn't
the right word, but--

42:33.260 --> 42:36.360
- It's the one
that comes to mind.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.300
- I was his best student.

42:38.300 --> 42:42.270
He was my favorite professor.

42:42.270 --> 42:44.300
I would see
his disappointment and--

42:47.320 --> 42:50.250
And now,
the chance for me and...

42:50.250 --> 42:54.200
this firm to fight for him,
to rescue him,

42:54.200 --> 42:57.390
it feels like...this chance
to ratify what we are,

42:57.390 --> 43:01.350
and yet, the things I've been
doing to help save him...

43:04.370 --> 43:06.350
To get that approval.

43:08.370 --> 43:11.190
[sighs]

43:11.190 --> 43:14.170
I've been everything
he accused me of becoming.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.380
- And what is it
you've become?

43:24.230 --> 43:27.330
- Some lawyer
who gets people acquittals.

43:27.330 --> 43:30.340
<i>[soft music]</i>

43:30.340 --> 43:33.340
- You're a lot
more than that, Lindsay.

43:33.340 --> 43:35.270
In his eyes,

43:35.270 --> 43:38.170
and everyone else's.
