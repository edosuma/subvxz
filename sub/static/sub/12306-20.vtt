WEBVTT

00:00.730 --> 00:02.653
Previously on "stalker"...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.490
You're not coming back, are
you? Why would you say that?

00:04.500 --> 00:07.322
My instinct would be to run.
That is what you did, jack.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.535
Except I didn't
run away.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.235
I ran to something--
my son.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.605
What would you
be running to?

00:11.610 --> 00:14.807
I wanted to look in on
an old case. It's personal.

00:14.810 --> 00:15.880
Stan gardner.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.109
Love obsession case.

00:17.110 --> 00:19.647
Stan's wife was
seeing other men,

00:19.650 --> 00:20.674
And he
strangled her.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.273
I just would really
appreciate

00:22.280 --> 00:23.213
Your fresh eyes
on it.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.540
I think stan gardner's
innocent.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.609
Where would you
begin your investigation?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.054
I would start
with your ex-husband.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.459
He was sleeping
with the victim.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.655
Janice: When you
first filed a report

00:30.660 --> 00:32.185
Against your
husband darren tyler

00:32.189 --> 00:34.522
3 months ago, he
was harassing you

00:34.530 --> 00:37.295
Why are you stalking
your ex-wife?

00:37.300 --> 00:39.029
Look. I know things
didn't end well.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.189
I got help.
What kind of help?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.589
I joined a love and sex
addicts support group.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.691
Darren has an alibi.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.700
Who else could it be?

00:44.710 --> 00:46.132
I started
to wonder who did

00:46.140 --> 00:47.232
Attack pam
in her house.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.469
The attacker jimmied
the window,

00:48.480 --> 00:50.073
Found the weapon
inside the house,

00:50.080 --> 00:51.275
And laid in wait
for his victim,

00:51.280 --> 00:53.544
Which is the exact
m.O. Of the killer

00:53.550 --> 00:54.711
In this case.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.610
You think these two
cases may be related.

00:57.620 --> 00:58.985
There's more than
just two.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.412
I found 4 murders

01:00.420 --> 01:01.251
With the same m.O.

01:01.260 --> 01:02.386
<i>'Each victim
in all 6 cases</i>

01:02.390 --> 01:05.621
Had a stalker who attended
a love and sex addiction

01:05.630 --> 01:09.225
So we've got a
serial killer out there.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.323
All of these men
were accused

01:12.330 --> 01:13.764
Of stalking
their ex-wives,

01:13.770 --> 01:16.068
Girlfriends,
or past relationships,

01:16.070 --> 01:18.334
The most recent being
pam tyler,

01:18.340 --> 01:19.899
Who survived
her attack,

01:19.910 --> 01:22.208
But francine johnson
was not so fortunate,

01:22.210 --> 01:24.599
Nor the 4 other cases
I've uncovered

01:24.610 --> 01:27.477
Murders where we presumed
the women to be killed

01:27.480 --> 01:29.016
By the men
who were stalking them.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.215
How are they
similar?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.245
To clarify--4 cases
where the murdered victims'

01:32.250 --> 01:36.414
One has since died,
two are serving life sentences,

01:36.430 --> 01:37.613
And one is on death row.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.927
All in the last
5 years.

01:38.930 --> 01:41.490
Yes. 6 female victims
who all share a common link.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.923
Their stalkers all lived
in los angeles,

01:43.930 --> 01:47.366
Where they attended
sex and love addiction meetings.

01:47.370 --> 01:50.169
Now each victim was attacked
in their own home.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.331
[scraping]

01:51.340 --> 01:54.366
The attacker entered
through a jimmied window.

02:00.280 --> 02:03.978
Sometimes, the victim
was home.

02:03.990 --> 02:08.018
The assailant used a weapon
found inside the home,

02:08.020 --> 02:10.408
A house tool, rope,

02:10.430 --> 02:12.455
A kitchen knife.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.462
The assailant wore
a ski mask.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.619
Trent: And how do we
know this?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.631
Vicky: From the surviving
victim pam tyler.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.200
So just
the one case.

02:26.170 --> 02:28.502
Janice: There's clearly
an erotic nature to the attacks,

02:28.510 --> 02:31.002
Which suggests
that the murderer enjoyed

02:31.010 --> 02:33.149
Stalking his prey.

02:33.150 --> 02:36.745
[telephone ringing]

02:39.990 --> 02:42.789
[ringing]

02:46.760 --> 02:48.091
Hello?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.159
Hey. What's up?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.628
Yeah. I have.
The morning off.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.290
Brian showed up yesterday.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.893
It's like he's following
me everywhere.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.935
It's really
creeping me out.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.261
[thump]

03:00.280 --> 03:03.773
Just a sec, megan.
I think I heard something.

03:26.030 --> 03:29.398
Hey. Yeah.
It was nothing.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.631
Jack: That definitely
defines an m.O.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.802
Serious hindsight
coincidence.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.505
Janice: Or a serial killer.

03:35.510 --> 03:38.548
Ehh. Oh, that's
where you lose me.

03:38.550 --> 03:39.779
Thanks
for the coffee.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.714
Vicky: Detective,
why do you take offense

03:41.720 --> 03:43.973
At the idea
of a serial killer?

03:43.990 --> 03:46.584
I'll admit we don't know
who killed francine johnson,

03:46.590 --> 03:49.116
But to suggest
a serial killer means

03:49.120 --> 03:51.760
That robbery homicide
arrested the wrong man

03:51.760 --> 03:54.923
_ Not once but
in 4 previous murder cases.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.398
Heh. Amanda.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.652
Amanda: Trent's right.
It also means that

03:57.670 --> 04:01.163
My office wrongly
convicted 4 men of murder.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.331
It's not statistically
possible

04:02.340 --> 04:03.466
In all levels
of incompetence.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.939
Look. I understand that
this may be hard to swallow,

04:05.940 --> 04:09.535
If all the victims' stalkers
attended addiction meetings,

04:09.550 --> 04:10.779
That alone
is suspect.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.077
4 of these cases
have convictions.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.572
All we are asking is
to an open an investigation.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.514
You want me to bring
this to the d.A.?

04:16.519 --> 04:20.047
Trent: Heh heh.
Good luck with that.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.915
Bye, guys.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.190
I'm gonna need
a lot more evidence.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.349
I commend you, janice.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.498
This is a very
compelling argument,

04:28.500 --> 04:30.855
But I cannot bring this
to the d.A.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.259
I need more.

04:33.270 --> 04:34.999
Sorry.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.378
Woman: Yeah.
Yeah. I'm on my way there.

04:44.380 --> 04:46.269
Mm-hmm.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.955
[house alarm beeps]

05:19.280 --> 05:21.840
Nice to see you.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.318
Hi!

05:23.320 --> 05:26.017
Morning.
Morning.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.340
Are you waiting
for me?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.987
Uh, amanda told me
you were coming today,

05:28.990 --> 05:30.389
So I had tim
from downstairs call me

05:30.390 --> 05:31.949
The moment you entered
the building.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.691
I just wanted a second
before everything got

05:34.700 --> 05:36.828
Crazy busy.

05:36.830 --> 05:37.729
Ok.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.494
So you decided
to come back.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.229
Yeah. Someone I respect
told me that I shouldn't

05:41.240 --> 05:44.801
Be running if I didn't
know where I was running to,

05:44.810 --> 05:46.835
So I listened.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.705
And, uh...

05:47.710 --> 05:51.442
[quietly]
the other night?

05:51.450 --> 05:53.179
Yes?

05:53.180 --> 05:55.478
We kissed.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.642
We did.

05:57.650 --> 06:00.381
And then you ran home.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.414
I did not.

06:01.420 --> 06:02.319
Yeah, you did.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.721
Well, I--I ran because
I kissed my boss.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.084
It was awkward.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.353
Yeah. Now we're at work
talking about it.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.657
More awkward.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.889
I just wanted to
clear the air,

06:11.900 --> 06:13.299
You know, see how
you felt about it,

06:13.300 --> 06:15.860
See if I still have
a job or not.

06:15.870 --> 06:19.829
Oh. No.
You're fired.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.979
The reason I took off
is because I--1

06:21.980 --> 06:23.573
Wasn't sure
if the timing was right.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.002
I felt like I was
taking advantage

06:25.010 --> 06:26.409
Of the moment
or something,

06:26.420 --> 06:28.570
And I--I wanted to
apologize if I--

06:28.580 --> 06:31.049
If I crossed the line.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.144
Did I cross the line?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.288
I kissed you, too,
jack.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.213
It goes both ways.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.121
Why don't we do this? Why
don't we talk about it later

06:41.130 --> 06:43.053
Outside of work?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.595
Yeah.
Ok.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.466
Yes.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.633
You're back!

06:53.640 --> 06:56.678
Don't get up.
I'll come to you.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.646
Agh. Go easy
with the love.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.175
I'm a work
in progress.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.945
I'm good. I just got
to take it easy is all.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.418
It's so good
to have you back.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.411
I read up on your
serial killer theory.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.411
How did robbery homicide
react?

07:08.420 --> 07:09.819
Didn't go over well
with trent.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.026
It's because love
and sex addicts isn't

07:12.030 --> 07:13.054
Enough of a connection.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.323
We got to narrow
it further.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.697
There are over 300 meetings
in I.LA. Each week.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.020
If we can find
one specific meeting

07:18.030 --> 07:19.520
That can link all _of the
stalkers in each murder,

07:19.540 --> 07:22.464
It will be hard to argue
that it's not a serial killer.

07:22.470 --> 07:24.802
Oh, how I've
missed you.

07:28.310 --> 07:29.630
Good morning.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.129
Morning.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.471
I hear your board review
went well.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.948
Thank you for your
kind words.

07:34.950 --> 07:37.772
I know you had a lot to do
with me returning so quickly.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.383
I only spoke
the truth.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.245
They asked me to stay on
for a couple of weeks

07:41.260 --> 07:42.386
To ease your transition.

07:42.390 --> 07:44.449
I'm in frazier's office.
He's on leave.

07:44.460 --> 07:45.530
Of course.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.827
Have you heard
anything more

07:46.830 --> 07:48.389
About stan gardner's
appeal?

07:48.400 --> 07:49.925
No, but the judge
granted my request

07:49.930 --> 07:52.797
To visit him
in prison.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.531
Have you approached
your ex-husband yet?

07:55.540 --> 07:56.462
Not yet.

07:56.470 --> 07:58.905
I want to hear gardner's
side of the story

07:58.910 --> 08:00.366
Before I speak to will.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.200
Are you sure you
want to take this on?

08:02.210 --> 08:05.475
I would think that it would
bring up so many feelings.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.970
You can always recuse
yourself.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.017
It's because
of those feelings that

08:09.020 --> 08:10.044
I wanted to take
this case.

08:10.050 --> 08:12.781
I've know this man
for 15 years.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.019
He's not the most noble.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.751
He forgets birthdays
and anniversaries.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.286
He lied to me
and cheated on me,

08:19.290 --> 08:24.228
But the idea of him killing
another human being...

08:24.230 --> 08:26.665
I know that feeling.

08:26.670 --> 08:29.594
How could you
misjudge to that extent,

08:29.610 --> 08:32.807
And then the horrible way it
plays over and over in your mind,

08:32.809 --> 08:33.936
It's debilitating.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.636
So you understand
why I have to do this.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.277
I do, and I have
already ordered

08:38.280 --> 08:40.772
The rest of the files
from stan's case.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.145
I'd like to continue
looking

08:42.150 --> 08:44.949
At the transcripts with
your permission of course.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.315
I'd like to help.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.254
Thank you, beth.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.084
[buzzer]

08:55.230 --> 08:57.949
Thank you for agreeing
to see me.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.769
As you know, I am
investigating your case.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.659
You're investigating
your husband.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.229
Ex-husband.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.662
I know why
you're here.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.162
I'm just looking
for the truth, mr. Gardner.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.375
Well, it's real easy.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.178
My wife was having an
affair with your husband.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.443
When she tried
to end it,

09:12.450 --> 09:14.703
He went crazy, and he
killed her, and I got the blame.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.949
I know that's
your story,

09:15.950 --> 09:17.270
But could you please
walk me through it?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.712
Where would you
like to start?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.814
With your alibi--
mr. Barry newly.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.310
He just came forward.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.549
Why wait 5 years?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.449
The guy's a drug dealer,
and so was I.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.986
He was running from the
law, and they found him.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.196
And this man is
a beacon of truth.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.520
He's got no stake
in this.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.668
Why would he lie, hmm?

09:32.670 --> 09:33.819
He recounted
my original testimony

09:33.840 --> 09:37.037
Word for word, and he's
never heard it before ever.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.735
So how did
the murder weapon

09:38.740 --> 09:40.959
Find its way into
the trunk of your car?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.903
Your husband planted
it there.

09:42.910 --> 09:45.004
The minute the police
questioned him,

09:45.010 --> 09:46.546
He started to panic
and set me up.

09:46.550 --> 09:48.609
My husband was with me
the night of the murder.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.078
Really? Your testimony
said that, uh,

09:51.090 --> 09:53.388
He went upstairs while
you worked downstairs.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.518
Are you sure he didn't
sneak out of the house?

09:55.520 --> 09:57.318
He was upstairs
watching television.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.923
I call that
opportunity, agent.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.625
No. That's where
you're wrong.

10:00.630 --> 10:02.553
Will had no motive
to murder your wife.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.528
The affair was over.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.498
Will wouldn't leave
sharon alone.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.661
He was harassing her.

10:07.670 --> 10:11.129
No, no. That's his story,
but it's not the truth.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.632
She ended it. That's when
he started following her.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.971
That's when he was
harassing her,

10:14.980 --> 10:17.335
Calling her at all hours
of the night.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.069
Will was stalking
your wife?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.674
This was never brought
into evidence.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.774
Because it can't
be proven.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.315
That's why I'm here.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.719
Your husband covered
his tracks,

10:27.720 --> 10:32.920
But make no mistake,
he killed my wife,

10:32.930 --> 10:35.024
And you know it.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.223
Ben: John murray
and darren tyler said

10:37.230 --> 10:38.823
They have no regular
meeting they attend.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.264
They go to different ones
around town.

10:40.270 --> 10:43.069
What we do know is that all
the stalkers we're looking at lived

10:43.070 --> 10:44.367
In and around
the hollywood area.

10:44.370 --> 10:47.362
That narrows our focus to
30, 40 potential meeting sites.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.200
Beth: Well, francine
johnson and pam tyler were

10:49.210 --> 10:50.678
In the hollywood area.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.909
Two days apart.

10:51.910 --> 10:55.141
The cooling off period
between the first two murders

10:55.150 --> 10:56.174
Was 36 months.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.841
Then there's.
a rapid acceleration.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.682
Victims 2 and 3,
18 months.

10:59.690 --> 11:01.818
3 and 4, 7 weeks.

11:01.820 --> 11:02.855
Now we're
two days apart.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.680
Which means he's
targeting his next victim.

11:04.690 --> 11:05.828
He's already
done that.

11:05.830 --> 11:06.854
If any of this
is true,

11:06.860 --> 11:09.158
We're about to find
another body.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.192
[beep]

11:12.200 --> 11:15.090
[alarm beeping]

11:18.640 --> 11:20.369
[blip]

12:13.430 --> 12:16.354
Woman on tv: The lapd is
looking for the male driver

12:16.360 --> 12:17.452
Of a red suv.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.724
[floor creaks]

12:21.470 --> 12:23.438
[turns off tv]

12:27.740 --> 12:29.469
[thud]

12:39.920 --> 12:41.888
Brian?

12:46.360 --> 12:49.159
This isn't funny.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.934
Brian?

13:02.780 --> 13:06.671
[breathes deeply]

13:06.680 --> 13:08.546
[door shuts]

13:45.090 --> 13:46.979
Ohh!

13:52.530 --> 13:53.725
Aah!

13:53.730 --> 13:55.494
Unh!

14:10.950 --> 14:12.941
The assailant
entered the house

14:12.950 --> 14:13.940
By jimmying
this window.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.475
According to
the security company,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.118
The alarm was disarmed
two hours

14:17.120 --> 14:18.986
Before christine harper
got home,

14:18.990 --> 14:21.186
And then it was
rearmed.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.554
Vicky: There are
motion sensors everywhere.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.255
He waited for her to
come home in the closet.

14:29.260 --> 14:30.955
She gets home,
disarms the alarm,

14:30.970 --> 14:34.292
Has no idea -
someone's in the house.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.859
So he knew the code.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.736
Maybe he knew her.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.434
Maybe.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.601
What was
the murder weapon?

14:39.610 --> 14:41.203
It was a knife in
the victim's kitchen.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.530
We talked to all
the neighbors.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.008
Nobody saw anyone
entering or leaving the house.

14:44.010 --> 14:47.071
We just got word that christine
harper recently filed a tro

14:47.080 --> 14:49.219
Against her ex-husband
brian mitchell.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.142
Where is he now?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.140
Unit's picking him up.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.187
Agent gregg, uh, your
serial killer theory,

14:53.190 --> 14:56.114
We're gonna start
digging into that.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.450
I would never
hurt christine!

15:00.460 --> 15:02.929
I loved her!
She was my wife!

15:02.930 --> 15:03.954
Who divorced you

15:03.970 --> 15:06.530
And filed a restraining
order against you.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.636
Ok. I admit I was
a little aggressive

15:09.640 --> 15:11.062
In my effort
to get her back.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.300
You left threatening
messages on her phone,

15:13.310 --> 15:14.607
You followed her
to her work,

15:14.610 --> 15:16.271
You sat
outside her house,

15:16.280 --> 15:18.476
You terrified the woman
you claim to love.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.542
It was stupid. I--I--I would
take it back if I could.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.676
I--I--I was upset!

15:23.690 --> 15:26.216
Why did she
divorce you?

15:26.220 --> 15:28.416
It's complicated.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.616
Christine and I were
polyamorous,

15:30.630 --> 15:32.450
But she always
struggled with it,

15:32.460 --> 15:34.849
And eventually,
she couldn't handle it

15:34.860 --> 15:35.998
And ended it.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.924
Help me out. A polyamorous
relationship means

15:38.930 --> 15:43.731
No. Christine and 1 were
only involved with one woman--

15:43.740 --> 15:44.639
Eva bowen.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.233
And what happened
with eva?

15:46.240 --> 15:47.969
She broke up
with me, too.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.072
Smart girl.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.502
Where were you
last night?

15:50.510 --> 15:51.238
Home.
Alone?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.776
Yes. You can't
seriously think

15:53.780 --> 15:55.179
I killed my ex-wife.

15:55.180 --> 15:56.409
Did you kill
your ex-wife?

15:56.420 --> 15:58.218
No! I loved her.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.882
She was my primary
relationship.

16:00.890 --> 16:03.450
Tell me about the sex
in these relationships.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.882
Is there
a problem there?

16:04.890 --> 16:05.982
What do you mean?

16:05.990 --> 16:07.151
You attend
recovery meetings

16:07.160 --> 16:10.391
For sex and love
addictions?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.220
Yes. I go to meetings.

16:12.230 --> 16:13.322
What meetings
do you attend?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.765
Mostly at the sunset
community arts center.

16:16.770 --> 16:17.862
That's my home group.

16:17.870 --> 16:19.668
And did you share
about christine harper

16:19.670 --> 16:21.707
And eva bowen
at these meetings?

16:21.710 --> 16:24.099
That's the point.
We talk about our issues.

16:24.110 --> 16:26.044
What does this have
to do with anything?

16:26.050 --> 16:27.540
Have you ever had
contact with anyone

16:27.550 --> 16:28.608
At these meetings
who took

16:28.620 --> 16:31.339
A suspicious interest
in your story?

16:34.320 --> 16:35.549
Look. People take
an interest.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.656
That's what we do there. We
share our common experience.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.128
Let's check
on eva bowen.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.962
She may be
our next victim.

16:45.970 --> 16:47.222
Get a statement.
See what she knows.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.867
And what about brian?
We can't hold him.

16:48.870 --> 16:50.690
We don't need to.
He's not our Killer.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.734
He's our stalker.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.765
He's the one that
the killer is targeting.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.999
I'm on it.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.102
I'm sorry
about christine.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.009
I hadn't talked to her
in a few months.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.217
Can you tell me about your
relationship with her and brian?

17:05.220 --> 17:07.540
We dated about 6 months,
the 3 of us.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.153
How did that work?

17:09.160 --> 17:13.154
I'm not familiar with
polyamorous relationships.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.719
It's cool.
No one is.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.050
We had a good
little thruple,

17:17.069 --> 17:18.526
Talked about moving
in together,

17:18.530 --> 17:21.170
But ultimately,
it wasn't a fit.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.730
Christine was
a businesswoman,

17:23.740 --> 17:25.503
All about her career.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.704
I'm a tattoo artist,

17:26.710 --> 17:30.237
A little too
alternative for her,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.048
And then there's brian.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.449
Tell me about brian.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.578
The guy can't keep it
in his pants.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.877
He is
a total sex addict.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.643
He means well, but
if he's not having sex,

17:39.650 --> 17:41.311
He doesn't know
who he is.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.856
Polyamory isn't
just about sex.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.251
It's about living your life
with multiple loving partners.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.560
Were you aware that he was
going to sex addiction meetings?

17:49.560 --> 17:51.494
Yeah, what good
it did.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.298
Was there anyone
in his meetings

17:53.300 --> 17:54.529
That took an interest
in brian

17:54.540 --> 17:56.736
Or his relationship
with you and christine,

17:56.740 --> 17:58.560
Anyone that
stuck out as odd?

17:58.570 --> 18:02.939
Oh, yeah. His buddy
jamie toliver,

18:02.940 --> 18:04.032
Who's jamie toliver?

18:04.050 --> 18:06.439
A friend from his
meetings, his sponsor

18:06.450 --> 18:07.770
Or sponsee, whatever
they call him.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.544
He was a freak.
In what way?

18:09.550 --> 18:10.642
He's obsessed with brian.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.140
Brian and I went
to dinner a few weeks ago,

18:12.150 --> 18:15.484
And jamie followed us
to the restaurant. Hello?

18:15.490 --> 18:17.185
Did jamie strike you
as violent?

18:17.190 --> 18:19.682
Oh, yeah.
He's a scary dude.

18:19.690 --> 18:23.695
Hot, but definitely
has creepy eyes.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.168
Vicky: I met
with stan gardner.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.763
He swears he did not
kill his wife.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.068
With his alibi surfacing,
he's going to walk.

18:30.070 --> 18:31.697
But is he innocent?

18:31.710 --> 18:33.132
He may be, yes.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.359
In the coroner's report,
it says that sharon died

18:35.380 --> 18:39.647
Stan gardner and his wife
live about half a mile from you,

18:39.650 --> 18:44.247
In your statement, you said
that will went upstairs to watch tv.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.513
Could he have left,
vicky?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.318
Is there a way for him
to get down

18:47.320 --> 18:48.446
From the second floor?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.416
There's a trellis,

18:49.420 --> 18:51.388
But here's where
I'm struggling.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.085
I heard him
at midnight.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.979
I checked my watch.
The water was running.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.650
I--I figured he was
brushing his teeth.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.119
OK. Let's say that the
coroner is off by 15 minutes.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.221
It's 17 blocks.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.698
At that time of night,
there's not many people.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.509
Could he have gotten
there in that time?

19:06.510 --> 19:08.763
It's possible.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.839
What about clothing,
leather clothing?

19:10.850 --> 19:12.841
Does will own
a leather jacket?

19:12.850 --> 19:14.705
Not that I recall.
Why?

19:14.720 --> 19:17.473
Well, stan's lawyer had
every file unsealed this week.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.548
Uh, in
the coroner's report,

19:18.550 --> 19:20.780
There were--there were
cuts on sharon's fingers.

19:20.790 --> 19:21.939
She fought her attacker.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.088
There was no dna,
fibers under her nails,

19:24.090 --> 19:26.229
But there was
a dark leather material.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.686
_ Will works
in corporate finance.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.099
It's all
very buttoned down.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.092
Not once have - I ever
seen him in anything leather.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.262
Regardless, I think
it's time to talk to him.

19:34.270 --> 19:36.364
He's the only other
suspect in the case.

19:36.370 --> 19:39.237
I want to. I just
need more evidence

19:39.240 --> 19:42.505
If I'm going to accuse
my ex-husband of murder.

19:42.510 --> 19:45.810
I checked with darren tyler
and john murray again.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.142
They reconfirmed they both
attended meetings at the arts center.

19:48.150 --> 19:49.675
They also remember
sharing at that meeting.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.011
Beth: Just like
brian mitchell.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.409
That's where the killer's
getting his information.

19:53.420 --> 19:54.649
Well, two is
a coincidence.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.551
I think it's time we check
out a sex addicts meeting.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.722
We're just trying to get
background for our case.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.095
We're here to expose
anyone.,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.489
Uh, I understand. I'll
help any way that I can.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.797
How many meetings
are there?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.131
Uh, there's 11
every day,

20:09.140 --> 20:10.790
But not all of them are sex
and love addict meetings.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.700
There's a.A., n.A,,
c.M.A.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.462
Are you secretary
for all of them?

20:15.480 --> 20:17.005
Heh. No, no.
Just this one,

20:17.010 --> 20:21.174
Um, but we do have meetings
all through the week, though.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.377
So do you know everyone
who attends the meetings?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.949
Mm-hmm. If they stick
around, I do.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.681
We have
a strong fellowship.

20:28.690 --> 20:29.452
So you hang out?

20:29.460 --> 20:31.383
Yep. That's the way
it works.

20:31.390 --> 20:32.585
May we stay
for the meeting?

20:32.590 --> 20:33.625
It's
an open meeting.

20:33.630 --> 20:34.722
You're welcome
to stay.

20:34.730 --> 20:35.754
Check it out. Yeah.
Of course.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.491
Thank you.
This should be interesting.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.795
Hey, bud.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.892
Ahem.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.366
Uh, hey, everybody.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.906
If you want to take
your seats,

20:46.910 --> 20:48.662
We can go ahead
and get started.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.536
Hi. Um, my name is nathan.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.973
I am a sex and love addict.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.505
Group: Hi, nathan.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.012
Hi.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.385
Uh, as you know,

20:59.390 --> 21:01.313
This meeting is
a safe space

21:01.320 --> 21:02.810
For people struggling
with issues

21:02.820 --> 21:04.356
Surrounding sex and love.

21:04.360 --> 21:08.285
So if you guys could help
me welcome our speaker tonight.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.859
It's charlie.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.659
[applause]

21:14.740 --> 21:17.994
Hi. My name is charlie,

21:18.010 --> 21:22.060
And I am a love
and sex addict.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.469
Group: Hi, charlie.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.448
I thought I'd start
by telling you

21:26.450 --> 21:29.750
Why I feel like I'm
qualified to be here.

21:31.220 --> 21:34.918
I've always had problems
with sex.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.685
9 months ago,
I was married

21:37.690 --> 21:41.183
To the woman
of my dreams--

21:41.200 --> 21:44.056
Smart, beautiful.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.823
Never been happier
in my life.

21:46.830 --> 21:50.391
Happiness is not a feeling
that I am used to.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.105
Beth: Her ex-husband's
a sex addict?

21:58.110 --> 21:59.441
I would assume so.
He was at the meeting.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.804
We never got a chance
to talk to him.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.777
He took one look at vicky
and was out the door.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.850
It was crazy.

22:03.850 --> 22:04.840
How did vicky react?

22:04.850 --> 22:06.079
Eh, she didn't
really say much,

22:06.090 --> 22:07.285
But it threw her,
I could tell.

22:07.290 --> 22:10.112
Who runs these
meetings anyway?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.155
Secretary is
nathan grant.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.424
Ben is running background
on him and others.

22:13.430 --> 22:17.924
So how you, uh, doing
this morning?

22:17.930 --> 22:21.423
Good. How you
doing this morning?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.737
You making fun
of me?

22:22.740 --> 22:25.437
No. You seem
very serious.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.635
I'm just asking.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.460
So we're--we're
good, right?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.073
Yeah. I mean--oh,
are we talking

22:30.080 --> 22:32.037
About the conversation
we had yesterday?

22:32.050 --> 22:34.007
We never talked
about it yesterday.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.408
Hey. We found
jamie toliver,

22:35.420 --> 22:36.774
He's in your office.

22:36.780 --> 22:38.043
Great.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.018
Duty calls.

22:59.610 --> 23:00.702
Hey.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.405
Thanks for coming over.

23:02.410 --> 23:04.572
Um, come on in.

23:04.580 --> 23:06.400
Thanks.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.279
Is your sister here?

23:09.280 --> 23:12.011
No. She's in laguna
on business.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.785
It's only me.

23:14.790 --> 23:17.418
How's your dad?

23:17.430 --> 23:22.027
I didn't ask you here
to talk about my dad.

23:22.030 --> 23:24.522
I know.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.567
Let's talk.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.892
Jamie: What am I
doing here?

23:29.900 --> 23:32.289
Beth: What's your
relationship with brian mitchell?

23:32.310 --> 23:33.163
He's a friend.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.365
You know him
from your meetings?

23:34.380 --> 23:35.700
It's an anonymous
program.

23:35.710 --> 23:36.939
Not today it's not.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.032
Answer the question.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.449
He's a friend I met
in the program.

23:39.450 --> 23:41.248
Are you obsessed
with him?

23:41.250 --> 23:42.069
No.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.115
Not what we hear.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.975
Brian's ex-wife
christine was murdered

23:44.990 --> 23:45.741
Two nights ago.

23:45.750 --> 23:46.717
Yeah, yeah.
I heard that.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.449
Where were you
two nights ago?

23:48.460 --> 23:50.417
You think I had
something to do with it?

23:50.430 --> 23:51.511
Do you also know
darren tyler

23:51.530 --> 23:52.725
And john murray
from your meetings?

23:52.730 --> 23:54.459
Why? Because they know you.

23:54.460 --> 23:57.919
And they described you
as odd and weird.

23:57.930 --> 23:58.829
Don't forget shady.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.696
Did you know
francine johnson?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.668
No, but I heard she
was murdered, too.

24:02.670 --> 24:06.834
No, and I don't-- I don't know
anything about any of this.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.602
All right? I--

24:07.610 --> 24:09.772
How about you
sit back down?

24:15.450 --> 24:17.373
You know, you have
quite the rap sheet--

24:17.390 --> 24:19.142
Prostitution,
larceny,

24:19.150 --> 24:20.311
Assault with
a deadly weapon.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.515
Oh, no. Those charges
were dropped.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.919
They speak
to a violent nature.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.581
Now back to my
colleague's question.

24:24.590 --> 24:25.853
Where were you
two nights ago?

24:25.860 --> 24:30.058
I was at group, and we
went for coffee afterward.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.097
We left shortly
after midnight.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.989
I need a name.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.297
Nathan grant.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.792
He's the secretary
in the meetings.

24:37.810 --> 24:41.565
Look. I didn't
kill anyone.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.708
<i>Will: I went to my
first meeting</i>

24:43.710 --> 24:47.203
The day you discovered
I was cheating.

24:47.220 --> 24:51.270
Losing you made me
realize I had a problem.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.418
I was a horrible husband
to you, vicky,

24:53.420 --> 24:56.811
But your leaving me
was the worst thing

24:56.820 --> 24:59.926
I have ever
had to live through.

24:59.930 --> 25:02.752
Is that what you talked
about at meetings?

25:02.760 --> 25:05.457
I talk about everything.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.791
It helps to get it out--

25:09.800 --> 25:13.668
My marriage,
my mistakes.

25:13.670 --> 25:16.310
It helps.

25:16.310 --> 25:20.508
When you left me,
I was lost. Heh.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.047
I'd ride by the house,
sit outside for hours.

25:24.050 --> 25:25.711
I know.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.884
I did run
a stalkers unit.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.619
Right.

25:35.460 --> 25:38.657
Thanks for telling
me this.

25:38.670 --> 25:42.129
There's still one thing
I have to know.

25:42.140 --> 25:43.665
The night
of sharon's murder,

25:43.670 --> 25:45.160
Did you leave the house?

25:45.170 --> 25:47.810
How can you still
not believe me?

25:47.810 --> 25:48.663
I spoke to stan gardner.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.375
He is still
accusing me, isn't he?

25:50.380 --> 25:51.905
He says that
he's innocent.

25:51.910 --> 25:53.344
And you believe him
and not me?

25:53.350 --> 25:54.647
We were in the midst
of a separation.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.140
You were staying
in the guest room.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.073
How could you think
I could kill her?

25:58.090 --> 26:00.184
It doesn't matter
what I think.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.340
As soon as stan's
verdict is overturned

26:02.360 --> 26:03.452
And the case
is reopened,

26:03.460 --> 26:05.815
You will be the first
suspect they go to.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.150
I didn't kill sharon,

26:07.160 --> 26:11.358
And I am done
defending myself to you.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.190
Where were you
two nights ago?

26:13.200 --> 26:14.998
Oh. What are you
talking about?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.263
It's just a question.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.398
At the office,
working late.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.937
And why is it any
of your damn business?

26:25.710 --> 26:28.407
You've lost your mind.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.570
I'm sorry I even came.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.383
Janice: We wanted to talk
to you about jamie toliver.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.188
Nathan: Jamie.
He didn't do

26:38.190 --> 26:39.589
Something stupid
and get himself

26:39.590 --> 26:40.853
Thrown into jail
again, did he?

26:40.860 --> 26:42.157
How well do you
know him?

26:42.160 --> 26:43.924
Pretty well. We sit
in group together.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.398
I mean, I wouldn't
say that we're friends.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.767
Maybe acquaintances
is the better word.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.431
He was at group
two nights ago?

26:49.440 --> 26:51.738
And you met him
for coffee afterwards?

26:51.740 --> 26:52.901
Yeah. We ran
into each other

26:52.910 --> 26:55.004
At a place just
down the street,

26:55.010 --> 26:58.002
Talked for
a little while.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.444
And how long
were you there?

26:59.450 --> 27:00.576
I wasn't there
for too long.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.900
I left a little
before 10:00.

27:01.920 --> 27:06.983
Yeah. I was home in time
to catch the 10:00 news.

27:06.990 --> 27:08.685
Beth: One of them's
lying about the timeline.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.283
What'd you find out
about nathan grant?

27:10.290 --> 27:12.281
Ran a background check.
He's totally clean.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.156
Solid alibis.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.355
Jamie is the one
with the rap sheet.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.623
Let's bring him in.
Jack: Already on it.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.291
Just got the ramey
warrant from judge abbot.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.792
Let's ping toliver's
cell phone.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.162
Looks like he's
somewhere in hollywood

27:24.170 --> 27:26.764
Between sunset boulevard
and santa monica boulevard,

27:26.770 --> 27:27.669
Vine and los palmas.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.933
That's near eva
bowen's tattoo shop.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.102
He's going after eva
just like he did christine.

27:32.110 --> 27:35.671
I'll have officers meet
you at the scene.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.218
Hey. I'm, uh,
looking for eva.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.848
She's in the back.
She'll be out in a minute.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.420
[heavy metal playing]

27:43.420 --> 27:46.958
Um-- no. It's fine.
We're old friends.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.925
What are you
doing here?

27:54.940 --> 27:56.237
I wanted to talk.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.767
You can't be in here.
Get out!

27:59.770 --> 28:01.704
Hey, chick--

28:03.840 --> 28:05.877
What did you tell
the police?

28:05.880 --> 28:09.009
Nothing. They asked
about brian.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.670
Said nothing
about me?

28:10.690 --> 28:12.545
I told them that
the two of you were friends

28:12.550 --> 28:15.520
And they should talk
to you about him.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.557
They think he
killed christine.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.985
No. Now they think
I did.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.855
Did you?

28:30.270 --> 28:32.489
Ugh!
Aah!

28:32.510 --> 28:36.731
Call the police!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

28:36.740 --> 28:38.879
Up against the wall!

28:45.790 --> 28:47.212
You ok?

28:47.220 --> 28:48.949
Yeah.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.823
I didn't kill christine.

28:54.830 --> 28:56.389
I wasn't trying
to kill eva.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.198
Well, we looked into
your alibi, jamie.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.190
It didn't check out.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.690
I told you I was
with nathan that night.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.169
Nathan says your
coffee date ended early.

29:03.170 --> 29:04.797
He was home by 10:00.

29:04.810 --> 29:05.800
Well, he was lying.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.130
Which would have
given you plenty of time

29:07.140 --> 29:09.336
To break into christine's
house and Kill her.

29:09.340 --> 29:10.307
You can't hold me here.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.302
Where's your proof
that I killed anyone?

29:15.320 --> 29:19.018
Well, I--I'm gonna
go with this.

29:25.190 --> 29:28.785
We found that in the
backseat of your car.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.430
I've never--I've never
seen this before.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.604
All right. You're right.
I have some issues,

29:40.610 --> 29:44.205
But I didn't
kill christine.

29:49.720 --> 29:50.778
What do you think?

29:50.790 --> 29:52.178
I don't know.
It's too easy.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.841
I mean, our killer is
methodical, brilliant.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.056
He managed to avoid
detection for 5 years.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.653
He would never leave
a piece of evidence

29:58.660 --> 30:00.185
Just lying out there
in the open.

30:00.190 --> 30:01.828
There's no
cooling off period.

30:01.830 --> 30:03.389
He's getting sloppy.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.198
Mmm. I think that
jamie's being set up.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.328
Then who's doing it?

30:07.330 --> 30:10.061
[door opens]

30:10.070 --> 30:11.799
I checked
with will hilton's company.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.960
He was not working the
night christine was killed.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.199
He lied about it?

30:15.210 --> 30:16.280
Your ex-husband
will?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.975
I'm checking alibis
on the other murders, too.

30:17.980 --> 30:19.436
So far, I've cleared
jamie toliver

30:19.450 --> 30:21.043
And brian mitchell
as suspects.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.779
And will?

30:22.780 --> 30:25.249
Not yet.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.140
Ok. So book and hold
jamie for battery

30:28.160 --> 30:29.889
Until we figure out
who killed christine

30:29.890 --> 30:32.951
And bring will in
for questioning.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.122
You got it.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.425
Vicky, legally,
you can't be here

30:42.440 --> 30:43.930
When we question
your ex-husband.

30:43.940 --> 30:44.998
I understand that.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.104
Go home, vicky.
We'll handle it.

30:47.110 --> 30:51.229
Ok, but there's something I
need you guys to do for me.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.744
Beth: Thank you
for coming in.

30:53.750 --> 30:54.546
Where's vicky?

30:54.550 --> 30:55.676
We're running point
on this one.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.409
Is this
about stan gardner?

30:57.420 --> 30:59.070
I know he's coming
after me,

30:59.090 --> 31:00.649
But I didn't kill
sharon gardner.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.312
No. This is
about something else.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.254
I don't understand.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.786
Do you know
christine harper?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.120
No. Should I?

31:09.130 --> 31:12.020
She was murdered
two nights ago.

31:14.370 --> 31:17.294
Vicky thinks I killed
sharon gardner

31:17.300 --> 31:18.165
And this woman?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.161
You recognize this
man--brian mitchell?

31:20.170 --> 31:22.639
Yeah, I recognize
him from meetings.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.301
The woman murdered
was his ex-wife.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.074
Where were you
two nights ago?

31:26.080 --> 31:28.105
We already checked
that alibi.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.076
Want to try
another one?

31:29.080 --> 31:31.515
I was at dinner with
a client, as in work.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.217
We need a name
and a number.

31:40.430 --> 31:42.853
You're free to go.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.055
What, that's it?

31:44.060 --> 31:46.927
Yes. Thank you
for your time.

31:46.930 --> 31:50.468
Yes. Thank you
really.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.507
Vicky on speakerphone:
How'd it go?

32:00.510 --> 32:01.807
We placed a tracker
on will's jacket.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.948
Ok. Great.
John from the nsa is

32:03.950 --> 32:05.714
On the other line.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.210
Hey, john.
It's vicky again.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.915
We're ready
for that trace.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.218
John: Coming
to you now.

32:11.420 --> 32:14.424
I got It.
Thank you, john!

32:17.230 --> 32:18.698
Jack: Vicky,
everything ok?

32:18.700 --> 32:20.168
I've got a trace.

32:20.170 --> 32:22.423
We need friends
at the nsa.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.704
What the hell?

32:32.710 --> 32:33.506
Where is he?

32:33.510 --> 32:36.070
He's right
outside my house.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.751
[click]

32:57.540 --> 32:59.736
[rattle]

33:23.560 --> 33:25.289
Unh!

33:53.190 --> 33:56.160
[breathing heavily]

33:59.430 --> 34:01.262
Huh!

34:01.270 --> 34:02.522
Ohh!

34:02.540 --> 34:05.498
[grunting]

34:05.510 --> 34:08.309
[cracking]

34:09.739 --> 34:10.730
Unh!

34:10.739 --> 34:13.846
[coughing]

34:13.850 --> 34:15.248
[gasps]

34:15.250 --> 34:18.049
[grunting]

34:20.489 --> 34:23.414
Agh! Ohh!

34:24.989 --> 34:28.152
[tires squealing]

34:28.159 --> 34:30.925
[sirens]

34:32.469 --> 34:35.393
[both grunting]

34:35.400 --> 34:37.289
[sirens]

34:40.810 --> 34:43.279
[gunshot]

34:46.650 --> 34:48.379
Vicky?

34:49.820 --> 34:53.347
Vicky?

34:53.350 --> 34:54.579
Vicky?

34:54.590 --> 34:57.081
Beth, I'm ok.
I wasn't shot.

34:57.090 --> 35:00.185
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

35:00.190 --> 35:02.386
[will groans]

35:02.400 --> 35:05.290
Will.
Vicky.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.290
Are you ok?

35:06.300 --> 35:09.065
He's dead.

35:09.070 --> 35:13.769
I'm ok. Yeah.
I'm ok.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.148
Will's being taken
to the hospital.

35:24.150 --> 35:26.244
Pulled the prints
from nathan's body.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.809
He's been using
a stolen identity.

35:27.820 --> 35:30.312
His real name is
nicholas kosta.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.186
Convicted felon
out of philadelphia.

35:32.190 --> 35:33.282
He's a jack
of all trades--

35:33.290 --> 35:35.554
Robbery, assault,
wanted in connection

35:35.560 --> 35:37.255
With his wife's
murder.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.295
Disappeared
6 years ago.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.290
Same time
the murders began.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.768
Can you tie him
to any other victims?

35:40.770 --> 35:43.023
No. Just francine johnson
and christine harper.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.235
What about
sharon gardner?

35:44.240 --> 35:46.038
Not yet, but it's
just a matter of time

35:46.040 --> 35:50.204
What I can't figure out is
why he came after you, vicky.

35:50.210 --> 35:53.646
Well, because will talked
about me in meetings.

35:53.650 --> 35:54.776
Transference killing.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.169
He looked at all
his victims as his wife.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.614
Yeah. He sat
in meetings,

35:58.620 --> 36:01.009
And when he heard
his own story being told,

36:01.020 --> 36:02.385
He found his victim.

36:02.390 --> 36:03.255
They were all his wife,

36:03.260 --> 36:06.412
And he got to kill her
again and again.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.728
<i>Yeah. Al I got
were a couple of cuts</i>

36:08.730 --> 36:10.198
From his watch.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.224
When you
get a chance,

36:11.230 --> 36:12.789
We'll need to
debrief you.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.996
Right. Thanks.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.563
Beth: Hey.
You heading out?

36:18.570 --> 36:20.607
Yeah. See you
tomorrow.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.635
Good work,
by the way.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.438
You, too.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.905
Vicky.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.070
I'll walk out
with you.

36:31.550 --> 36:35.248
Man: why do birds

36:35.260 --> 36:38.981
suddenly appear

36:38.990 --> 36:43.450
every time you are near?

36:43.460 --> 36:44.894
Amanda: Jack.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.028
The d.A.'s gonna
make a formal statement

36:47.030 --> 36:48.361
About nathan grant
in the morning.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.862
It should go
fairly smoothly.

36:50.870 --> 36:53.202
Nice work.

36:53.210 --> 36:56.066
Hey. You think you could
take ethan for the weekend?

36:56.080 --> 36:57.673
Sure.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.977
Thanks, jack.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.641
I'll take him anytime.

37:00.650 --> 37:03.039
Trent: Hey.
Ready?

37:03.050 --> 37:05.371
Yeah.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.280
It's just drinks.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.883
We're talking.

37:09.890 --> 37:17.890
Every time
you walk by

37:18.370 --> 37:19.758
Need some help?

37:19.770 --> 37:20.566
Nope. I got it.

37:20.570 --> 37:22.993
I'll take that
as a yes.

37:24.870 --> 37:25.769
Drinks?

37:25.770 --> 37:27.431
I have painkillers.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.135
Fun!

37:30.680 --> 37:32.375
Ha ha!

37:32.380 --> 37:36.248
On the day
that you were born

37:36.250 --> 37:39.572
the angels got together

37:39.590 --> 37:43.754
and decided to create

37:43.760 --> 37:47.754
a dream come true

37:47.760 --> 37:55.224
so they sprinkled
moon dust in your hair of gold

37:55.240 --> 38:01.668
and starlight
in your eyes of blue

38:08.480 --> 38:11.609
ooh, yeah

38:11.620 --> 38:15.511
ooh, ooh

38:15.520 --> 38:17.409
[knock on door]

38:19.460 --> 38:22.725
Ooh

38:22.730 --> 38:27.327
ooh, ooh, ooh

38:27.330 --> 38:29.128
Hey.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.198
What are you
doing here?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.395
I thought you were
at the hospital.

38:31.410 --> 38:32.832
Oh, they bandaged
me up,

38:32.840 --> 38:34.239
Told me to go home.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.299
Why didn't you?

38:36.310 --> 38:38.802
I wanted to see you.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.676
Can I come in?

38:43.450 --> 38:47.739
Ooh, ooh

38:47.750 --> 38:49.684
Do you want a drink?

38:49.690 --> 38:51.454
Sure.

38:51.890 --> 38:56.555
Vicky: So I bet you
came here for an apology.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.823
No.

38:57.830 --> 39:01.494
I came because I was
concerned about you.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.491
Is that so hard
to believe?

39:03.500 --> 39:06.231
No, but I did accuse
you of murder.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.232
Yeah. it'll hold it
against you another time.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.733
Heh heh. I'm sure
you will.

39:12.750 --> 39:16.709
Close to you

39:16.720 --> 39:20.179
Cheers.

39:20.190 --> 39:21.589
You know, come
to think of it,

39:21.590 --> 39:26.380
An apology would
be kind of nice.

39:26.390 --> 39:28.051
I'm sorry.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.256
I truly am.

39:35.500 --> 39:39.038
On the day that
you were born

39:39.040 --> 39:42.863
the angels got together

39:42.880 --> 39:44.405
What?

39:44.410 --> 39:45.332
It's just that--

39:45.350 --> 39:47.079
I was accepting
your apology.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.479
With a kiss?

39:48.480 --> 39:49.447
Yeah. How do you
apologize?

39:49.450 --> 39:53.409
I mean, with me,
that's pretty standard.

39:53.420 --> 39:55.388
And you did kind of
kiss back.

39:55.390 --> 39:58.257
Your hair of gold

39:58.260 --> 40:04.358
and starlight
in your eyes of blue

40:06.900 --> 40:09.062
[knock on door]

40:14.610 --> 40:19.935
Ooh, ooh, ooh

40:19.950 --> 40:22.044
Thought I might be
hearing from you.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.417
We never finished
our conversation.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.385
Right.

40:27.390 --> 40:28.312
Can you talk?

40:28.320 --> 40:32.882
Uh, yeah.
Let's talk.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.119
You first.

40:34.130 --> 40:35.154
No. Y-you first.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.289
I went first last time
when we tried this.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.928
Ok.

40:40.930 --> 40:44.798
Ooh, ooh

40:44.810 --> 40:47.461
ooh, ooh

40:47.470 --> 40:50.201
I don't know
where this is going,

40:50.210 --> 40:53.544
But I'd like it
to continue.

40:54.710 --> 40:58.817
They long to be

40:58.820 --> 41:01.915
close to you

41:01.920 --> 41:03.342
Ha ha ha!

41:03.360 --> 41:07.820
Ooh, ooh, ooh

41:11.900 --> 41:13.664
Ouch.

41:13.670 --> 41:15.490
You ok?

41:15.500 --> 41:17.832
They're just
a few cuts.

41:21.370 --> 41:23.236
You still wear it.

41:23.240 --> 41:26.870
Of course I do. It's
the nicest watch I own.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.912
Did you ever fix
the clasp?

41:34.920 --> 41:36.718
Yeah.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.886
What's wrong?

41:42.900 --> 41:44.425
How did it break?

41:44.430 --> 41:48.094
I don't remember.
It was years ago.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.625
Oh, my god.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.961
It broke
in the struggle.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.165
What are you
talking about?

41:53.170 --> 41:56.834
There were leather fibers
under sharon's fingernails.

41:56.840 --> 42:01.573
Sharon cut her fingers
on the metal clasp.

42:01.580 --> 42:02.399
She broke it.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.013
Hey. You have got
to stop this.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.478
No! You strangled her.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.413
Come on, vicky.
The police would have

42:08.420 --> 42:09.410
Checked my watch.

42:09.420 --> 42:12.185
No, because you had
an alibi.

42:12.190 --> 42:15.387
They never investigated
you beyond that.

42:20.730 --> 42:23.665
So what are we
gonna do now, vicky?
