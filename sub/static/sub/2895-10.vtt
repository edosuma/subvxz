00:00.096 --> 00:01.301
Previously on Suits...

00:01.325 --> 00:02.820
Sheila Amanda Sazs,

00:02.820 --> 00:03.988
will you marry me?

00:04.022 --> 00:06.357
Yes, I'll marry you.

00:06.391 --> 00:08.859
When we have kids,
world, watch out.

00:08.893 --> 00:09.994
Louis, I don't want kids.

00:10.028 --> 00:12.780
Sheila, I'm gonna be a father.

00:12.831 --> 00:14.031
Mike Ross is not coming back
to this firm.

00:14.065 --> 00:15.749
You heard Louis.
He already gave him the job.

00:15.784 --> 00:17.868
I want to know
why the hell you came back.

00:17.902 --> 00:19.586
What matters is
that I'm staying,

00:19.621 --> 00:21.405
because this is where I belong.

00:21.423 --> 00:23.063
This makes it look
like Forstman's payment

00:23.074 --> 00:24.758
never went
to any offshore accounts,

00:24.793 --> 00:25.926
and that you never took
a piece of it.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.428
That's forgery.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.130
Which is a less of a crime
than what you did.

00:30.181 --> 00:32.299
- I had no choice!
- Bullshit, you had no choice!

00:32.350 --> 00:34.184
You could have said "no" at any
goddamn point along the way.

00:34.219 --> 00:36.103
One thing is for sure.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.306
When all this is over, I'm
gonna fire the shit out of you.

00:39.357 --> 00:44.111
I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for Louis.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.363
I'll take care of it.

00:46.398 --> 00:48.565
"Dear Harvey and Jessica,

00:48.599 --> 00:50.284
"I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.904
"Effective immediately,
I, Louis Litt,

00:53.938 --> 00:56.940
"am resigning
from Pearson Specter.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.959
Please take care of my home."

01:21.399 --> 01:25.602
- One, two.
- Give me a second, gimme a sec.

01:25.636 --> 01:26.904
You're not dressed for it.

01:26.938 --> 01:28.906
Maybe we can get you
some trunks, go a few rounds.

01:28.940 --> 01:31.358
I think I've already
gone a few rounds.

01:31.409 --> 01:34.611
I need your help.

01:34.645 --> 01:36.580
Anything.
What can I do for you?

01:36.614 --> 01:39.283
Clients.
I need clients.

01:39.317 --> 01:40.868
Louis, the by-laws say that...

01:40.919 --> 01:42.286
Come on, Harvey. You think
I don't know what they say?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.587
I wrote the by-laws.

01:43.621 --> 01:45.989
Yeah, and who'd you
write 'em for, huh?

01:46.007 --> 01:49.426
Jessica, and she's not gonna
make an exception for you.

01:49.461 --> 01:50.627
Well, maybe she'll make one
for you?

01:50.661 --> 01:51.762
She's not going to.

01:51.796 --> 01:53.013
Harvey, do you think
I want to be here?

01:53.047 --> 01:55.048
I tried to get interviews
at six different firms

01:55.100 --> 01:57.267
and every one of them
said the same thing:

01:57.302 --> 01:58.719
It's a bloodbath out there.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.571
Which means if I can't
bring business with me,

02:00.605 --> 02:01.805
I might as well move to Siberia

02:01.839 --> 02:03.524
because I'm never gonna
find a job in this city.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.608
- Louis...
- Harvey.

02:04.642 --> 02:06.843
I'm not askin' for the moon.

02:06.861 --> 02:08.862
Just three companies that
I brought to the firm myself

02:08.896 --> 02:12.616
when they were nothing.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.787
Let me talk to Jessica.

02:16.821 --> 02:19.823
Thank you.

02:32.504 --> 02:34.555
Harvey, you don't look busy.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.840
Would you like to attend
the international securities

02:36.874 --> 02:38.926
law symposium?
That depends.

02:38.977 --> 02:40.677
Is it in Vegas, Miami, or Rio?

02:40.711 --> 02:43.347
- Poughkeepsie.
- Send Paul Porter.

02:43.381 --> 02:46.567
What can I do for you?

02:46.601 --> 02:47.935
I just saw Louis.

02:47.986 --> 02:51.054
No. He's not getting
any clients.

02:51.072 --> 02:52.489
He just wants three.

02:52.524 --> 02:54.224
Letting them go won't break us.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.577
No, it won't,
but it will open the floodgates

02:56.611 --> 02:57.945
for every partner

02:57.996 --> 02:59.913
that ever thought of leaving
and taking their clients.

02:59.948 --> 03:01.415
He's not every partner

03:01.449 --> 03:03.534
and he's worked his fingers
to the bone for both of us,

03:03.568 --> 03:05.252
and he's asking for a crumb.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.037
And I give him that crumb,
and next thing you know,

03:07.071 --> 03:08.922
all the cookies
in the cabinet are gone.

03:08.957 --> 03:10.073
You don't know that.

03:10.091 --> 03:12.793
I do know that instead
of talking about giving

03:12.844 --> 03:14.578
Louis' clients away,

03:14.596 --> 03:16.880
you should be working
on keeping your own.

03:16.914 --> 03:20.083
Jessica, I'll find a way
to keep Versalife,

03:20.101 --> 03:22.052
but that has nothing
to do with Louis.

03:22.086 --> 03:23.387
We owe the man something.

03:23.421 --> 03:25.806
And I'm giving him something.

03:25.857 --> 03:29.059
My phone rings and he gets
a glowing recommendation

03:29.093 --> 03:32.529
instead of me saying that he
left after committing a felony.

03:32.564 --> 03:34.364
No one's gonna call
if he can't get in the door.

03:34.399 --> 03:38.986
That's on him, not on me.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.616
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

03:52.634 --> 03:53.750
You really want those vultures

03:53.784 --> 03:55.636
in bankruptcy
picking through his stuff?

03:55.670 --> 03:58.672
It just doesn't feel okay
going through his things.

03:58.723 --> 04:00.340
Rachel, you haven't heard from
him. I haven't heard from him.

04:00.391 --> 04:02.309
If we don't pack up his stuff,
who will?

04:02.343 --> 04:03.644
I guess you guys
had the same idea I did.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.312
Yeah.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.681
- He didn't take that either?
- No.

04:07.732 --> 04:08.982
I just cleaned it.

04:09.017 --> 04:10.317
It was smudged

04:10.351 --> 04:12.486
and I didn't want to give it
back to him dirty.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.855
He must have been
in such a hurry.

04:14.906 --> 04:18.692
He was in a hurry 'cause
he was ashamed.

04:18.743 --> 04:22.746
I want to just
get this over with.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.755
- Jessica, what...
- Am I doing here?

04:31.789 --> 04:35.342
I'm here to tell you
that I know you know the truth

04:35.376 --> 04:36.677
about Louis' resignation.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.095
I don't know...

04:38.129 --> 04:41.998
Yes, you do, and I'm guessing
you didn't like it.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.016
You're right.

04:43.051 --> 04:44.434
I didn't.

04:44.469 --> 04:47.220
Because I don't think
that he deserves to be fired.

04:47.272 --> 04:50.440
That's funny, because I think
you both deserve to be fired.

04:50.475 --> 04:53.277
- What do you...
- You knew what he did,

04:53.311 --> 04:54.895
and you said nothing.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.564
So that's why you're here.

04:57.615 --> 04:58.782
To fire me.

04:58.816 --> 05:02.903
No. I'm here to give you
a second chance.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.220
Those don't look
like my case files.

05:20.254 --> 05:22.706
They're not,
but I didn't come empty-handed.

05:22.724 --> 05:24.641
I got you somethin'.
A job?

05:24.676 --> 05:27.477
General counsel
at Procter & Gamble.

05:27.512 --> 05:30.380
Procter & Gamble?
What is that, a joke?

05:30.398 --> 05:33.216
They're in Cincinnati, which is
like, American for "Siberia."

05:33.234 --> 05:34.267
It's American for

05:34.319 --> 05:36.219
"number 31 on the <i>Fortune</i> 500,"

05:36.237 --> 05:38.271
and it's a chance
to make a fresh start.

05:38.323 --> 05:39.606
Whose idea was this chance?

05:39.657 --> 05:41.274
Her majesty?

05:41.326 --> 05:42.859
Oh, yeah,
I bet she loved that.

05:42.893 --> 05:44.077
Ship me off
and never see me again.

05:44.112 --> 05:46.913
Louis, it was my idea,
and you should take it.

05:46.948 --> 05:48.832
Well, would you take it?

05:48.866 --> 05:49.899
No way on earth.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.951
You know why?

05:51.002 --> 05:53.036
Because this is Rome,

05:53.070 --> 05:55.172
you're a gladiator,
and so am I.

05:55.206 --> 05:57.124
Then be a gladiator.

05:57.175 --> 05:59.459
Take this job and fight
your way back here.

05:59.510 --> 06:01.712
I don't have
to go to Cincinnati

06:01.746 --> 06:03.680
to fight my way back here.

06:03.715 --> 06:06.717
I can goddamn fight Jessica.

You here to pick up your things.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.661
I'm here to pick
the three clients that are mine.

06:44.662 --> 06:47.814
Those clients, like everyone
this firm represents,

06:47.815 --> 06:50.100
belong to me, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

06:50.134 --> 06:52.352
Oh yes there is,
'cause pursuant to the by-laws,

06:52.403 --> 06:53.636
you're required
to inform clients

06:53.654 --> 06:55.238
of any attorney's departure.

06:55.273 --> 06:58.475
If you fail to do so prior
to me giving you formal notice,

06:58.493 --> 07:00.243
they're up for grabs.

07:00.278 --> 07:01.528
Well, you wrote the by-laws.

07:01.579 --> 07:03.180
I'll take your word
that's what they say.

07:03.197 --> 07:05.582
Oh, I see. You don't think
I can take 'em from you, huh?

07:05.616 --> 07:08.418
Well, I'm the one who brought
them in and answered their call

07:08.453 --> 07:09.453
at 4:00 in the morning,

07:09.454 --> 07:11.421
when all you did
was take your cut.

07:11.456 --> 07:12.873
Is that all I did?

07:12.924 --> 07:14.624
Yes, and that's
why I'm gonna win them,

07:14.658 --> 07:16.209
because I deserve them.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.845
And that's what it always
is with you, Louis, isn't it?

07:18.880 --> 07:19.880
What you deserve.

07:19.931 --> 07:21.214
You're goddamn right it is,

07:21.265 --> 07:23.016
and you have some nerve
tellin' me no

07:23.050 --> 07:24.217
after all I've done for you.

07:24.268 --> 07:27.854
What you've done
is break the law,

07:27.889 --> 07:30.724
and I'm still willing to give
you a good recommendation.

07:30.775 --> 07:34.177
I don't need your
bullshit recommendation.

07:34.195 --> 07:36.062
I need clients, and if
you're not gonna give 'em to me,

07:36.114 --> 07:38.115
you better strap in,
because I'm gonna take 'em.

07:43.905 --> 07:45.122
Louis.

07:45.156 --> 07:46.623
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls.

07:46.657 --> 07:48.992
I don't like contact
during transitional periods.

07:49.026 --> 07:50.710
But you didn't even
say goodbye.

07:50.745 --> 07:51.945
What is there to say, Katrina?

07:51.963 --> 07:53.914
Well...

07:53.965 --> 07:55.715
When you're ready,

07:55.750 --> 07:57.200
I would love to take you out
for dinner.

07:57.218 --> 07:59.169
We can't do that.
You're on the other side now.

07:59.203 --> 08:00.921
- What are you talking about?
- I gave Jessica notice.

08:00.972 --> 08:01.972
I'm going after three clients.

08:02.006 --> 08:03.006
- Louis...
- No-no-no.

08:03.007 --> 08:04.090
We're gonna go do battle,

08:04.142 --> 08:05.225
and I do not want to put you
in the position

08:05.259 --> 08:06.226
to fraternize with the enemy.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.379
You're not the enemy, Louis.

08:09.397 --> 08:13.350
Jessica had me contact all
of your old clients in person.

08:13.384 --> 08:15.569
She what?

08:15.603 --> 08:17.571
You can't approach them.
It's over.

08:17.605 --> 08:20.357
I have to get going.

08:20.391 --> 08:22.159
Louis!

08:22.193 --> 08:23.577
I am so sorry.

08:23.611 --> 08:25.912
I didn't want to do it.
Don't be.

08:25.947 --> 08:29.332
If it had to be somebody,
I'm glad it was you.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.234
I'm in the middle of a merger.

08:31.252 --> 08:32.369
What's so important
that I had to come down

08:32.403 --> 08:33.570
to your shitty office?

08:33.587 --> 08:34.948
This used to be
your shitty office.

08:34.956 --> 08:36.905
And after that,
it belonged to six other people,

08:36.924 --> 08:38.375
five of whom are now gone.

08:38.409 --> 08:39.509
What's your point?

08:39.544 --> 08:42.095
That things can change
in the blink of an eye.

08:42.129 --> 08:44.097
- Louis.
- Yes, Louis.

08:44.131 --> 08:46.216
Took all of ten seconds
to scrape his name off the wall.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.019
How long do you think it's gonna
take Jessica to scrape off mine?

08:49.053 --> 08:50.253
What are you lookin' for,
Mike?

08:50.254 --> 08:53.023
Harvey, Jessica
sees me as a huge problem.

08:53.057 --> 08:54.608
The solution is just
to get rid of me.

08:54.642 --> 08:55.809
I don't want that to happen, so

08:55.860 --> 08:57.944
I need to solve
an even bigger problem.

08:57.979 --> 09:00.230
And you want me
to give you a bigger problem.

09:00.264 --> 09:01.448
I just got back.
I need you to give me

09:01.482 --> 09:03.316
the biggest problem you've got.
Fine.

09:03.367 --> 09:08.121
Sterling Pharmaceuticals
is merging with Pfizer.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.156
Come on, smart guy.
You want to solve the problem?

09:10.208 --> 09:11.408
You better be able
to identify it.

09:11.442 --> 09:13.376
There is no problem.
They merge.

09:13.411 --> 09:15.712
They only make up 26%
of the market.

09:15.746 --> 09:18.381
That's... that's not
over the limit for 10b-6.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.800
But?

09:20.835 --> 09:22.385
Shit.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.920
Versalife puts us
over the limit.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.088
We have to drop them.

09:25.122 --> 09:27.624
Unless we figure out a way
around 10b-6.

09:27.642 --> 09:29.926
Like I told Jessica I would.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.127
You told her that?

09:31.145 --> 09:32.762
Harvey, no one has ever
been able to do that.

09:32.796 --> 09:33.897
Listen to me.
You want to make a splash?

09:33.931 --> 09:37.901
Part the Red Sea.

09:42.073 --> 09:45.075
Oh, no.
"Oh, no," what?

09:45.109 --> 09:46.326
You have that look
on your face

09:46.360 --> 09:47.644
like you want me to have
some emotional conversation

09:47.662 --> 09:49.162
I don't feel like having.
You know what, Harvey?

09:49.196 --> 09:51.364
I just came in here to see
if you needed anything.

09:51.415 --> 09:54.868
- I don't.
- Okay, fine.

09:54.919 --> 09:57.454
Listen, I know that
this whole thing with Louis

09:57.488 --> 09:58.838
is upsetting you.

09:58.873 --> 09:59.989
No. What's upsetting me,
is you saying

10:00.007 --> 10:01.124
you're here to see
if I need anything

10:01.158 --> 10:02.509
when you really want
to talk about Louis.

10:02.543 --> 10:05.095
I'm worried about him.
He's in a really bad place.

10:05.129 --> 10:06.630
You think I don't know that?
That's why I tried to help him.

10:06.664 --> 10:08.098
I got him a job
on a silver platter

10:08.132 --> 10:09.766
and he threw it in my face.

10:09.800 --> 10:10.800
And he shouldn't
have done that.

10:10.834 --> 10:12.185
Yeah. Then why are you here?

10:12.219 --> 10:17.691
Because I still think
we can help.

10:17.725 --> 10:18.841
- Donna...
- Harvey.

10:18.859 --> 10:21.311
You did a good thing
by getting him that job.

10:21.345 --> 10:23.680
It was the right instinct,
but it was the wrong city.

10:23.698 --> 10:25.565
Yeah, I can't get him anything
in New York.

10:25.616 --> 10:26.950
I'm not talking
about New York.

10:26.984 --> 10:29.953
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

10:36.661 --> 10:39.129
Nice grouping.

10:39.163 --> 10:41.214
How'd you know I'd be here?

10:41.248 --> 10:42.849
Because you go mudding
when you're happy,

10:42.866 --> 10:44.501
and you come here when you're
looking to blow off steam.

10:44.535 --> 10:46.703
Well, I am blowing off steam,
Donna,

10:46.721 --> 10:49.639
and I'm not finished, so
unless you can handle a pistol,

10:49.674 --> 10:53.176
do me a favor please
and just leave me alone.

11:02.269 --> 11:03.553
Uh, how do you...

11:03.571 --> 11:05.739
Connecticut junior
pistol championship finalist.

11:05.773 --> 11:06.856
Three years in a row.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.158
What years?

11:08.192 --> 11:10.560
Ask me that again
and I will use this on you.

11:10.578 --> 11:11.861
Is there anything
that you can't do?

11:11.895 --> 11:13.563
No, there isn't.

11:13.581 --> 11:17.567
Including talking Harvey
into getting you another job.

11:17.585 --> 11:18.901
So where is it this time?

11:18.919 --> 11:20.787
Cincinnati? Minneapolis?

11:20.838 --> 11:22.422
Anchorage, Alaska?

11:22.456 --> 11:23.707
Boston.

11:23.741 --> 11:25.759
Sheila.

11:25.793 --> 11:27.127
Yes, Sheila.

11:27.178 --> 11:28.294
You got Harvey
to do this for me?

11:28.346 --> 11:30.747
I got him to give you his word
he will do it,

11:30.765 --> 11:32.298
but after you turned down
Cincinnati,

11:32.350 --> 11:34.434
he's not gonna make the call
unless you say you're on board.

11:34.468 --> 11:35.602
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

11:35.636 --> 11:38.087
Donna, Sheila values strength.

11:38.105 --> 11:39.773
She's gonna
see this as me coming to her

11:39.807 --> 11:41.558
at a time of weakness.

11:41.592 --> 11:43.693
Louis, you go to Boston
with the sole purpose

11:43.728 --> 11:49.115
of being with her, she's gonna
see that as a sign of love.

11:49.150 --> 11:52.452
Tell him to make the call.

11:52.486 --> 11:54.103
Okay, Kyle, I think
the question you have to ask is,

11:54.121 --> 11:57.240
"where do I see myself
in ten years,"

11:57.274 --> 12:03.163
and unfortunately, the answer
is, "not as a Harvard graduate."

12:03.214 --> 12:05.799
Idiot.

12:05.833 --> 12:08.835
Louis, what are you doing here?

12:08.886 --> 12:12.338
I'm here to take you back.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.841
I-I don't understand,
the way we lef...

12:14.892 --> 12:17.894
I don't care how we left it.

12:17.928 --> 12:21.314
Not a day has gone by that
I haven't thought of you,

12:21.348 --> 12:24.934
and I can't hold
it back anymore.

12:24.968 --> 12:27.070
Sheila, I love you,

12:27.104 --> 12:31.274
and I want us to be together.

12:31.308 --> 12:35.161
Louis, this is wonderful,
but it's... it's...

12:35.196 --> 12:37.363
It's just a lot to take in.

12:37.415 --> 12:40.149
To believe that
you're really ready to commit.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.751
Well, how's this for ready?

12:41.786 --> 12:43.670
I'm taking a job in Boston.
What?

12:43.704 --> 12:44.921
I quit Pearson Specter.

12:44.955 --> 12:47.841
Oh, my g...

12:47.875 --> 12:50.427
I can't believe it.

12:50.461 --> 12:51.511
You did all that for me?

12:51.545 --> 12:52.712
Yes.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.931
Well, I...

12:54.965 --> 12:59.219
- Well, what?
- I got a job in Boston for you.

12:59.270 --> 13:00.553
Louis, did you
make that decision

13:00.604 --> 13:02.772
before or after you
quit your old job?

13:02.807 --> 13:04.307
What difference does it make?

13:04.341 --> 13:06.175
It makes a huge difference.

13:06.193 --> 13:08.778
You don't call for six months,
and then...

13:08.813 --> 13:10.230
One day you wake up,
quit your job,

13:10.281 --> 13:12.732
and suddenly I'm supposed
to fill the hole in your life?

13:12.783 --> 13:14.183
No-no-no-no-no,
it's not like that.

13:14.201 --> 13:16.069
- Okay, then what is it?
- I mean, do you know

13:16.120 --> 13:18.705
how hard it was
for me to not call you?

13:18.739 --> 13:21.207
I was tryin' to move on.
Then why didn't you move on?

13:21.242 --> 13:23.626
Because I realized
that I don't need New York.

13:23.661 --> 13:26.913
I need you.

13:26.964 --> 13:29.299
Louis, geography was
the least of our problems.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.834
No, I know.

13:30.868 --> 13:33.169
And... and I want you to know
that I've come around on that.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.421
You don't "come around"
on children.

13:35.473 --> 13:37.874
I don't want them, and I'm not
going to change my mind.

13:37.892 --> 13:40.042
You don't have to,
because I've changed mine.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.895
Okay, and I believe
that you believe that, it's...

13:41.929 --> 13:43.263
Well, then if you b...

13:43.314 --> 13:44.931
I'm just sensing
that you don't know where I'm...

13:44.982 --> 13:46.048
Louis, when I asked
if you'd quit first,

13:46.066 --> 13:48.050
I was asking because if...

13:48.068 --> 13:49.686
If I believed that you
were really ready

13:49.720 --> 13:52.188
to give up children,
I would run

13:52.222 --> 13:55.325
into your arms
and never let go,

13:55.359 --> 13:57.527
but if you're doing this
because you're down and out...

13:57.561 --> 13:58.728
But that's just it.

13:58.746 --> 14:00.497
Do you understand that
I was going to change

14:00.531 --> 14:03.917
my entire work schedule
weeks ago for you?

14:03.951 --> 14:07.954
Before all this.
You were going to.

14:08.005 --> 14:10.290
But you didn't.
Sheila, please.

14:10.341 --> 14:11.291
You have to understand
where I'm...

14:11.342 --> 14:13.676
It was good
to see you, Louis.

14:13.711 --> 14:17.764
Please go.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.166
I see frustration.

14:32.191 --> 14:35.871
You see me getting
my ass kicked by FTC rule 10b-6.

14:35.872 --> 14:36.500
And?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.701
Harvey needs and update
and I don't have shit.

14:38.735 --> 14:39.735
And if you were Harvey
and he was Jessica,

14:39.753 --> 14:41.421
you'd say you're all over it.

14:41.455 --> 14:42.872
I can make that happen.

14:42.906 --> 14:44.090
I'm all over it.
Good.

14:44.124 --> 14:45.575
Donna, send a bottle
of Johnnie Walker Blue

14:45.593 --> 14:47.113
to Jonathan Palmer,
and get him tickets

14:47.127 --> 14:48.428
to the next Sox game,

14:48.462 --> 14:50.380
and then find out
when his wife's birthday is,

14:50.414 --> 14:52.465
his kid's birthday,
his dog's birthday.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.434
- How am I supposed to...
- I don't care how you do it.

14:54.468 --> 14:55.635
Figure it the hell out.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.636
Harvey, this is
a thank you to him.

14:56.687 --> 14:57.921
Why are you so mad at me?

14:57.955 --> 14:59.939
It's not a thank you,
it's an apology for you

14:59.974 --> 15:01.927
talking me into getting him
to give Louis a job.

15:01.928 --> 15:02.596
What did he...

15:02.597 --> 15:03.958
He didn't show up
to the interview,

15:03.964 --> 15:05.597
and what's happening
with our Versalife problem?

15:05.598 --> 15:06.965
I'm all over it.

15:07.016 --> 15:08.583
Yeah, "all over it" means
you don't have dick.

15:08.601 --> 15:11.937
Next time I see you,
have something.

15:13.589 --> 15:15.974
Jonathan Palmer's in Boston.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.860
Harvey got Louis a job there
because of Sheila, didn't he?

15:18.895 --> 15:20.612
- Yes.
- Donna, if he didn't show up

15:20.646 --> 15:22.447
for the interview, it means
it didn't work with Sheila.

15:22.481 --> 15:24.900
Shit.

15:24.934 --> 15:28.320
He's gonna be devastated.

15:28.371 --> 15:30.071
You bring him his box
of stuff yet?

15:30.105 --> 15:32.540
No, but I'm going
to right now.

15:32.575 --> 15:34.376
- Let me do it.
- Listen to me.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.877
Harvey's pissed at you
because you don't have anything

15:35.912 --> 15:36.962
and Louis needs me.

15:36.996 --> 15:38.296
Donna, I am here
because that man

15:38.331 --> 15:39.331
put my well-being
before his own.

15:39.382 --> 15:42.167
He gave up going
after Sheila for me.

15:42.218 --> 15:44.285
For all I know, that's why it
didn't work out for him up there

15:44.303 --> 15:46.221
and it's...

15:46.255 --> 15:49.891
The least I can do,
is comfort him when he's down.

15:51.894 --> 15:54.896
Go.

15:59.435 --> 16:00.735
Come in, come in.

16:00.770 --> 16:02.136
What are you doin' here?

16:02.154 --> 16:05.190
Stuff has been sitting
on your desk for days.

16:05.241 --> 16:07.308
I wanted you to have it.

16:07.326 --> 16:10.862
Okay. I'll need it
for my new office.

16:10.913 --> 16:12.030
You got a job?

16:12.081 --> 16:16.368
- Not yet, but I will.
- Oh.

16:17.703 --> 16:19.504
Order of the Coif.

16:19.538 --> 16:22.507
Yeah, look who
graduated magna cum laude.

16:22.541 --> 16:25.293
Summa, actually,
for all the good it'll do me.

16:25.327 --> 16:28.213
I know there's got to be
a story behind this key. Yeah?

16:28.264 --> 16:29.881
From one of your
first cases or...

16:29.932 --> 16:31.099
Mike, do me a favor, please.

16:31.133 --> 16:33.501
Just stop it, will you?
Stop what?

16:33.519 --> 16:34.519
Stop asking questions that
you already know the answers to

16:34.553 --> 16:35.770
just to stay here longer.

16:35.805 --> 16:36.805
- Louis, I'm not...
- You're not what?

16:36.839 --> 16:38.339
Examining me? Yes,
you are.

16:38.357 --> 16:40.442
You're just making small talk
while you look around the room

16:40.476 --> 16:42.727
to see if there are any
sharp objects in the vicinity.

16:42.778 --> 16:44.279
That is not why I came here.

16:44.313 --> 16:47.615
Well, it wasn't to deliver
a box of my shit.

16:47.650 --> 16:50.318
Look, when I was drowning,
you threw me a lifeline, okay?

16:50.352 --> 16:51.903
Okay, well,
that's nice of you to say,

16:51.954 --> 16:54.205
and I appreciate you
bringing over my things,

16:54.240 --> 16:56.241
but they're not exactly
a lifeline.

16:56.292 --> 16:57.993
I heard about Boston.

16:58.027 --> 16:59.961
What'd you hear?

16:59.996 --> 17:02.697
That Harvey got you a job
and you didn't even show up.

17:02.715 --> 17:04.549
Well, why would I
when the love of my life

17:04.583 --> 17:06.251
rips out my heart
and then stomps on it?

17:06.301 --> 17:07.551
Louis, I'm just trying
to help.

17:07.586 --> 17:10.505
Well, you can't!

17:10.539 --> 17:12.874
I don't have Sheila.

17:12.892 --> 17:16.478
I don't have a job.

17:16.512 --> 17:20.815
And right now I'd just
prefer to be alone.

17:32.695 --> 17:35.830
No.

17:35.865 --> 17:38.416
Well, I don't care
what he says.

17:38.451 --> 17:42.037
15% of bullshit
Is still bullshit.

17:42.071 --> 17:43.088
Dick.

17:43.122 --> 17:44.622
What can I do for you, Mike?

17:44.673 --> 17:46.875
I can see you're busy, sir, so
I'll just jump right to it and...

17:46.909 --> 17:48.376
Hold it right there.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.962
If this is your asking me
for Rachel's hand in marriage,

17:51.013 --> 17:54.799
you know, you're goin'
about it the wrong way.

17:54.850 --> 17:57.102
Sir, I think if I were gonna
do that, I'd have the foresight

17:57.136 --> 17:59.437
to ask your wife
how to approach you first.

17:59.472 --> 18:00.889
Good answer.

18:02.525 --> 18:04.442
I'm actually here
about Louis Litt.

18:04.477 --> 18:05.627
Yeah, I heard he resigned.

18:05.661 --> 18:07.629
He did, and he's looking
for a job.

18:07.663 --> 18:09.864
A fellow like that
should have his pick.

18:09.899 --> 18:11.983
Well, the partnership
agreement prohibits him

18:12.034 --> 18:13.485
from taking clients.

18:13.536 --> 18:15.320
- Ooh, shit.
- Yeah.

18:15.371 --> 18:17.772
Ah, Jessica doesn't
play around, does she?

18:17.790 --> 18:18.871
She took his firstborn too?

18:18.874 --> 18:21.826
Look, I know it's bad
out there, but...

18:21.877 --> 18:22.961
Bad? It's the apocalypse.

18:22.995 --> 18:24.278
And I'm not runnin'
a soup kitchen.

18:24.296 --> 18:27.048
If a partner
can't bring me clients...

18:27.083 --> 18:28.416
What's that?

18:28.450 --> 18:31.586
These are Louis' billables
for the last 15 years.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.839
Mm.

18:34.890 --> 18:37.225
This guy ever sleep?
And he doesn't just bill.

18:37.259 --> 18:39.144
He trains the associates,
he publishes.

18:39.178 --> 18:41.229
He will give his life to you.

18:41.263 --> 18:44.065
And you want me to do this
because you're with my daughter?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.817
I want you to do this
because I've never asked you

18:45.851 --> 18:47.652
for a thing, and
the first time I am,

18:47.686 --> 18:49.771
it's a favor for someone else.

18:49.805 --> 18:51.689
That's the kind of man
that your daughter is with.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.775
So it's because you're
with my daughter?

18:53.809 --> 18:55.660
You're gonna see it
how you're gonna see it,

18:55.694 --> 18:57.445
but the real question is:

18:57.479 --> 19:02.500
What are you gonna
do about Louis Litt?

19:02.535 --> 19:06.588
I'll meet with him.

19:06.622 --> 19:07.839
But there's no guarantee.

19:07.873 --> 19:11.626
Well, that's all I can ask.

19:11.660 --> 19:14.562
You tell my daughter to give
her old man a call sometime.

19:14.597 --> 19:17.298
Yes, sir.

19:20.936 --> 19:23.054
Hey.
You look happy.

19:23.105 --> 19:26.558
I am happy, because today
I did a good thing.

19:26.609 --> 19:28.526
You're going to let me paint
the bedroom robin's egg blue?

19:28.561 --> 19:30.145
I said I did a good thing.

19:30.179 --> 19:32.230
I didn't say
I did a ridiculous thing.

19:33.699 --> 19:36.401
I got Louis a job interview
in New York.

19:36.452 --> 19:38.186
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

19:38.204 --> 19:40.321
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

19:40.355 --> 19:42.490
Oh, I love you.

19:42.524 --> 19:43.691
I'm gonna fix you a drink
to celebrate.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.577
Well, you should fix
one for yourself too,

19:45.628 --> 19:47.962
because I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:47.997 --> 19:49.714
What do you mean?

19:49.748 --> 19:51.966
I mean the interview's
with your dad.

19:52.001 --> 19:53.218
What?

19:53.252 --> 19:58.423
I went to your dad for Louis.

19:58.474 --> 20:01.759
What?

20:01.810 --> 20:03.761
It's really sweet.

20:03.812 --> 20:06.380
But...

20:06.398 --> 20:07.815
Let's just say
there's a reason

20:07.850 --> 20:10.602
that I didn't go to my dad
to pay for law school.

20:10.653 --> 20:11.603
I thought you said it was
because you wanted

20:11.654 --> 20:12.904
to do it yourself.

20:12.938 --> 20:15.857
It is, but other people
don't have a problem

20:15.891 --> 20:17.325
going to their parents

20:17.359 --> 20:21.395
because they don't have to wait
for the other shoe to drop.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.198
What are you talking about?

20:23.232 --> 20:24.766
He's not gonna
give something for nothing.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.868
So you mean after this, he's
gonna want something from me?

20:26.902 --> 20:32.073
I don't know, but he's gonna
want something from someone.

20:32.091 --> 20:36.794
If it gets Louis a fresh
start, I really don't care.

20:44.783 --> 20:46.039
Oh man....

20:46.064 --> 20:47.681
Really?
Yeah.

20:47.732 --> 20:48.815
- You got to be kiddin' me.
- No.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.100
You went there too?

20:50.134 --> 20:51.151
Every Tuesday
for the last five years.

20:51.185 --> 20:53.487
Oh. Wednesday.

20:53.521 --> 20:56.189
Chicken parm day.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.240
More like Christmas to me.

20:57.275 --> 20:58.608
- Oh, I believe it.
- Oh, Louis.

20:58.642 --> 21:00.027
This has been a pleasure,

21:00.078 --> 21:03.113
but it's time that we got
down to the crux of the matter.

21:03.147 --> 21:04.414
You want to know
why I resigned.

21:04.449 --> 21:05.982
Well, I did call Jessica,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.001
and she gave you
a glowing recommendation,

21:08.036 --> 21:09.503
and we both know
that's bullshit.

21:09.537 --> 21:11.004
You want to know the truth.

21:11.039 --> 21:12.655
Did I say anything
about the truth?

21:12.674 --> 21:15.042
I'm just makin' sure you know
I know that it's bullshit.

21:15.093 --> 21:17.461
But my truth is,
I don't care why you left.

21:17.495 --> 21:19.463
All I care about
is what you're gonna take.

21:19.497 --> 21:20.697
What?

21:20.732 --> 21:23.200
You take one client,
I could give a shit

21:23.234 --> 21:25.835
How big it is, and I'll make you
a senior partner on the spot.

21:25.853 --> 21:27.104
Wait a second.

21:27.138 --> 21:29.056
Mike Ross said

21:29.107 --> 21:31.358
that I was not required
to bring business.

21:31.392 --> 21:32.976
This isn't about business.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.728
This is about balls.

21:34.779 --> 21:35.979
I don't need another grinder,

21:36.013 --> 21:37.781
I need a lawyer
who can kick a door in,

21:37.815 --> 21:39.733
and the door in question
is Pearson Specter's.

21:39.784 --> 21:41.785
You want to see if I can break
my partnership agreement?

21:41.819 --> 21:43.286
You're damn right I do,

21:43.321 --> 21:47.124
because if you can't do that,
then what the hell good are you?

21:48.993 --> 21:50.026
You're no different
than Jessica.

21:51.162 --> 21:53.630
I'll take that
as a compliment.

21:53.664 --> 21:54.664
Well, if you'll excuse me,

21:54.698 --> 21:56.750
Sylvia will validate you
on the way out.

21:56.801 --> 21:57.918
Yeah, well,

21:57.969 --> 22:00.504
Robert, this is New York.
I take a cab.

22:00.538 --> 22:03.507
See, that's my way
of saying "get the hell out."

22:11.649 --> 22:12.983
Well, how long
is a little while?

22:13.017 --> 22:14.351
Do you have any...

22:14.385 --> 22:15.519
Louis!

22:15.553 --> 22:17.354
Excuse me.

22:17.388 --> 22:19.072
Katrina, what are
you doing here?

22:19.107 --> 22:20.690
You know what I'm doing here.
This isn't your client anymore.

22:20.724 --> 22:22.909
You're prohibited
from contacting them.

22:22.944 --> 22:25.412
- I-I'm not here to see...
- Neubacher Capital?

22:25.446 --> 22:26.997
Yes, you are.

22:27.031 --> 22:28.615
Just like you're going
to go see Carver Tech

22:28.666 --> 22:30.867
and Blackthorne Simons.

22:30.901 --> 22:32.619
How do you know that?

22:32.670 --> 22:34.287
- Because they called me.
- What are they saying?

22:34.338 --> 22:35.699
Doesn't matter
what they're saying.

22:35.706 --> 22:37.257
It's plain as day
you're trying to poach them.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.875
- Does Jessica know?
- Not yet.

22:38.909 --> 22:40.210
But if you keep doing this,
she's gonna find out.

22:40.244 --> 22:41.428
Yeah, well, let her sue me,

22:41.462 --> 22:42.745
'cause I don't have
any other choice.

22:42.764 --> 22:43.764
What are you talking about?

22:43.798 --> 22:45.265
Robert Zane offered me
senior partner

22:45.299 --> 22:46.800
if I can break
the partnership agreement.

22:46.851 --> 22:49.519
That is a major law firm
in New York.

22:49.554 --> 22:50.854
I'm not gonna get
a better chance than that.

22:50.888 --> 22:51.888
Louis...

22:51.889 --> 22:53.440
Look, tell Jessica
if you have to.

22:53.474 --> 22:55.809
I don't want to get you
in trouble, okay?

22:55.860 --> 22:59.596
But I just lost my job.

22:59.614 --> 23:01.731
And I just lost the woman
I love for the second time,

23:01.765 --> 23:03.483
all in one week.

23:03.534 --> 23:06.936
Now I have this chance
to turn my life around...

23:06.954 --> 23:11.107
with this one client.

23:11.125 --> 23:14.544
I'm gonna take it.

23:14.579 --> 23:17.664
Louis.

23:20.835 --> 23:23.720
You want one client,
I'll give you one client.

23:23.754 --> 23:25.955
What? Wait, no...

23:25.973 --> 23:27.757
When you agreed to take me on,

23:27.791 --> 23:30.143
I swore that
I would be loyal to you,

23:30.178 --> 23:32.929
and if I'm not loyal now,
then I never was.

23:32.963 --> 23:35.515
Katrina, if you do this
and Jessica figures it out,

23:35.566 --> 23:37.267
she will fire you,

23:37.301 --> 23:39.019
and I cannot live with that.

23:39.070 --> 23:40.937
That won't matter
if you get the job

23:40.971 --> 23:44.641
and you take me with you.

23:44.659 --> 23:48.778
Give me the goddamn name.

23:50.248 --> 23:51.832
What?

23:51.866 --> 23:53.116
I'm gonna tell you something,

23:53.150 --> 23:55.418
and I don't want
you to overreact.

23:55.453 --> 23:57.787
From the look on your face,
I'm not makin' any promises.

23:57.821 --> 23:58.821
I just got an email
from Louis.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.624
He's going after Versalife.

24:00.658 --> 24:02.342
- Get me Ray.
- What are you gonna do?

24:02.376 --> 24:03.960
Get me Ray!

24:03.994 --> 24:05.428
Harvey, it was just
a notification email.

24:05.463 --> 24:07.681
You don't even know where he is!
Yes, I do.

24:07.715 --> 24:08.849
What are you talking about?

24:08.883 --> 24:11.551
That notification is required
by the bylaws.

24:11.602 --> 24:13.186
He's doing it
at the last second.

24:13.221 --> 24:15.805
I guarantee you he's walking
in Versalife's door right now.

24:20.528 --> 24:23.680
Hell do you think
you're doing?

24:23.698 --> 24:25.949
Not doing, did.
I just signed Versalife.

24:25.983 --> 24:27.984
- You have no right.
- Please, I have every right.

24:28.018 --> 24:30.353
Because when I quit, Jessica
only notified my clients,

24:30.371 --> 24:31.621
not yours,
because she didn't think

24:31.656 --> 24:33.189
I had enough balls
to go after you head-on.

24:33.207 --> 24:34.541
That wasn't her, that was me,

24:34.575 --> 24:36.826
because I didn't think
you would stoop this low.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.362
Oh, too bad. You exposed
your flank, now you're too late.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.364
Yeah, and you can see
the fear in my eyes.

24:41.382 --> 24:42.999
Excuse me.

24:43.033 --> 24:45.368
I told you, you're too late.

24:45.386 --> 24:46.920
To tell them
an unemployed clown

24:46.971 --> 24:48.838
just sold them
a pile of bullshit?

24:48.872 --> 24:52.392
You mean the bullshit that you
have to drop them as a client?

24:52.426 --> 24:53.560
The Pfizer merger.

24:53.594 --> 24:55.729
FTC rule 10b-6.

24:55.763 --> 24:58.014
They were not pleased
that you kept them in the dark.

24:58.048 --> 25:00.066
- You are a son of a bitch.
- Who's the clown now?

25:00.101 --> 25:01.518
You're a son of a bitch.

25:01.552 --> 25:02.819
I'm only taking one client

25:02.853 --> 25:04.220
that you're gonna
have to drop anyway.

25:04.238 --> 25:05.388
The least you could do
is be a gentleman about it.

25:05.406 --> 25:07.490
A gentleman?
I got you two jobs!

25:07.525 --> 25:10.277
Two jobs in Siberia!

25:10.328 --> 25:12.562
Out of pity.

25:12.580 --> 25:14.497
I got you those jobs
out of compassion,

25:14.532 --> 25:16.032
just like when
I fought for Jessica

25:16.066 --> 25:17.867
to not fire you
in the first place.

25:17.901 --> 25:19.586
But when I take Versalife back,

25:19.620 --> 25:22.622
it's gonna be without
any feeling for you at all.

25:30.414 --> 25:31.681
What happened?

25:31.716 --> 25:33.967
I lost them,
but I'm gonna get 'em back.

25:34.018 --> 25:36.937
What I want to know is
how the hell did Louis find out

25:36.971 --> 25:38.087
that we had to drop them?

25:38.105 --> 25:39.105
I don't know.

25:39.140 --> 25:40.273
People know shit.

25:40.308 --> 25:41.358
People don't know shit.

25:41.392 --> 25:44.311
People get told shit.

25:44.362 --> 25:45.645
Jessica, I know I wanted
to throw him a bone,

25:45.696 --> 25:48.064
but I did not tell him.

25:48.098 --> 25:49.733
I wasn't talkin' about you.

25:49.767 --> 25:51.234
I was talking about Mike Ross.

25:51.268 --> 25:52.619
Bullshit, Mike didn't tell...

25:52.653 --> 25:54.120
Tell me you didn't have him
working on Versalife.

25:54.155 --> 25:55.956
- That doesn't mean...
- I knew it.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.774
He was working on Versalife.

25:57.792 --> 26:00.126
He owes Louis
for bringing him back here.

26:00.161 --> 26:01.944
That is motive and opportunity.

26:01.963 --> 26:04.581
You just want him gone
by any means necessary.

26:04.615 --> 26:07.917
Oh, I think I have been
more than clear about that.

26:07.951 --> 26:08.951
Yeah, well,
try another theory,

26:08.970 --> 26:10.337
because Mike
would never do this.

26:10.388 --> 26:12.088
Oh, there are a lot of things

26:12.122 --> 26:15.425
you never thought
Mike Ross would do.

26:15.459 --> 26:18.094
Sell out an old man's company.

26:18.128 --> 26:20.096
Get in bed with a billionaire.

26:20.130 --> 26:23.800
Cut his boss out of a deal.

26:23.818 --> 26:27.354
- Jessica...
- People change, Harvey.

26:27.405 --> 26:28.471
And to top it all off,

26:28.489 --> 26:31.775
Louis is taking Versalife
to Robert Zane.

26:31.809 --> 26:34.778
Mike Ross' future father-in-law.

26:34.812 --> 26:37.781
Why don't you think about that?

26:48.342 --> 26:51.994
Mike, I need to know
what you have on Versalife.

26:59.186 --> 27:01.521
- It was me.
- What was you?

27:01.555 --> 27:02.722
Louis going after them
is my fault.

27:02.773 --> 27:04.374
- What did you...
- I went to Robert Zane

27:04.392 --> 27:06.276
and I asked him
to give Louis a job.

27:06.310 --> 27:07.644
That's it?

27:07.678 --> 27:09.396
You didn't tell him
about Versalife?

27:09.447 --> 27:11.781
Of course not, wh...
You think I would do that?

27:11.816 --> 27:12.866
Never mind what I think.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.684
You went to one
of our biggest competitors

27:14.702 --> 27:16.369
and put 'em together
with a desperate Louis.

27:16.404 --> 27:18.621
I did it because Louis
<i>was</i> desperate, all right?

27:18.656 --> 27:19.989
I went to see him the other day
to bring him his stuff,

27:20.023 --> 27:21.458
it was just...
The other day?

27:21.492 --> 27:24.077
You're telling me when you
were supposed to be helping us

27:24.128 --> 27:25.495
keep our client,

27:25.529 --> 27:27.831
you were busy giving them
to Louis on a silver platter?

27:27.865 --> 27:30.250
I was, but I also figured out
how to get them back.

27:30.301 --> 27:31.885
- Why didn't you tell me then?
- 'Cause I was trying to think

27:31.919 --> 27:33.053
of a better option.

27:33.087 --> 27:34.704
What the hell's
wrong with this option?

27:34.722 --> 27:36.866
It involves going
to Walter Gillis.

27:46.216 --> 27:48.685
Well, look
who decided to drop by.

27:48.719 --> 27:50.403
The man who lost me my company

27:50.438 --> 27:52.689
and his partner
who tore it to shreds.

27:52.723 --> 27:54.724
Walter, I understand
how you must feel.

27:54.742 --> 27:56.058
So, why are you here?

27:56.077 --> 27:57.827
Because we have a proposition
for you.

27:57.862 --> 27:59.913
Does it involve an apology?

27:59.947 --> 28:03.116
It is an apology.

28:08.923 --> 28:10.573
You want me to buy Versalife?

28:10.591 --> 28:13.426
We want you to buy
a division of Versalife.

28:13.461 --> 28:14.911
The division
that makes that drug.

28:14.929 --> 28:17.213
They've been working on
anti-addiction meds for years.

28:17.247 --> 28:19.466
Look at the results.
This one works.

28:19.517 --> 28:21.918
But it's a money-loser
and it's gonna take years.

28:21.936 --> 28:23.436
They don't have
the capital, the patience,

28:23.471 --> 28:25.188
or the will.
But you do.

28:25.222 --> 28:27.640
And let me guess, you two are
here out of the goodness

28:27.691 --> 28:29.859
of your hearts.
You want the truth?

28:29.894 --> 28:32.762
He'd be here whether this was
for his own good or not.

28:32.780 --> 28:35.615
For me, I'm here
because it gets me out of a jam.

28:35.649 --> 28:37.250
So you can stick it to us
if you want to,

28:37.267 --> 28:40.102
but if you do that...

28:40.121 --> 28:41.988
You're gonna miss the chance
to save a lot of other people

28:42.039 --> 28:43.272
just like Phillip.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.792
Don't ever talk to me
about Phillip again.

28:45.826 --> 28:47.210
- Walter...
- No.

28:47.244 --> 28:50.663
This is how all this started,
with you using my son.

28:50.714 --> 28:53.583
No, I'm the one
who used your son.

28:53.617 --> 28:56.169
I used him to get control
of your company,

28:56.220 --> 28:58.338
but everything Mike did
from the second he met you

28:58.389 --> 28:59.789
was to save your company,

28:59.807 --> 29:02.392
because when it comes
to caring about people,

29:02.426 --> 29:03.510
he's twice the man that I am,

29:03.561 --> 29:05.512
and by the way,
he never gave up on you,

29:05.563 --> 29:07.147
and he never sold you out.

29:07.181 --> 29:08.398
Bullshit.

29:08.432 --> 29:09.432
You're right, it is.

29:09.466 --> 29:12.602
Mike, no.

29:12.636 --> 29:14.404
The truth is,
is that I gave you my word.

29:14.438 --> 29:16.990
I told you I would never sell
you out and then I got into bed

29:17.024 --> 29:18.575
with someone
that I never should have trusted

29:18.609 --> 29:20.777
and I lost you your company.
Yes, you did.

29:20.811 --> 29:22.245
And that company
was your family.

29:22.279 --> 29:25.365
It gave you purpose,
but you still have money,

29:25.416 --> 29:27.000
and this is a purpose.

29:27.034 --> 29:30.370
Walter, if you don't want
to do this, I get it.

29:30.421 --> 29:32.455
But I need you to understand
that the only reason

29:32.489 --> 29:36.125
I even thought to come to you
in the first place

29:36.159 --> 29:37.710
is that I'm gonna regret
what I did to you

29:37.761 --> 29:41.798
for the rest of my life.

29:47.700 --> 29:48.700
Can I come in.

29:48.714 --> 29:50.498
Of course.

29:52.048 --> 29:55.333
I hope you're not
furious with me.

29:55.352 --> 29:57.836
I'm not mad.

29:57.854 --> 29:59.271
You're not?

29:59.305 --> 30:01.006
No.

30:01.024 --> 30:02.775
Well, good.

30:03.860 --> 30:05.194
I wanted to...
Thank you

30:05.228 --> 30:07.345
for setting up that meeting
with Robert Zane.

30:07.364 --> 30:09.014
I just hope you understand
that if I had a choice,

30:09.032 --> 30:10.366
I never would have gone
after Versalife,

30:10.400 --> 30:11.850
but I had no choice.

30:11.868 --> 30:14.119
Louis, we took them back.

30:14.154 --> 30:16.354
What?

30:16.373 --> 30:18.123
But you had to drop them.

30:18.158 --> 30:20.376
Not anymore.

30:20.410 --> 30:23.245
We convinced them to sell
their trial drug division.

30:23.296 --> 30:26.364
Of course. You drop a drain
on their earnings,

30:26.383 --> 30:27.750
stock price
goes right through the roof.

30:27.801 --> 30:29.721
And their market share
falls below the threshold.

30:29.753 --> 30:30.969
But who the hell
would buy it?

30:31.004 --> 30:34.139
Walter Gillis.

30:41.147 --> 30:43.432
Of course, Walter Gillis.

30:43.483 --> 30:45.217
- Louis, listen...
- Mike.

30:45.235 --> 30:47.219
You won.

30:47.237 --> 30:49.238
You're a brilliant lawyer.

30:49.272 --> 30:51.023
You are a brilliant lawyer.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.158
Yeah, I'm a brilliant lawyer
who's never gonna work again.

30:53.193 --> 30:54.410
Hey, stop.

30:54.444 --> 30:57.362
That is not true.

30:57.396 --> 30:59.114
Look... look... look
at everything that you have.

30:59.165 --> 31:01.566
A Harvard law diploma,
summa cum laude,

31:01.584 --> 31:02.951
Order of the Coif.

31:03.002 --> 31:05.337
Those are the credentials
of a supreme court justice.

31:05.371 --> 31:08.040
Nah, that and 2 bucks will
get me a seat on the subway,

31:08.074 --> 31:10.959
but thank you
for having the decency

31:11.010 --> 31:12.594
to tell me in person.

31:12.629 --> 31:13.846
Louis, come on.

31:13.880 --> 31:14.913
Let me... let me...

31:14.931 --> 31:16.131
Let me stick around for a while.

31:16.182 --> 31:17.415
We'll have... we'll have a couple
of drinks.

31:17.434 --> 31:22.354
You... you can tell me the story
about that key.

31:22.388 --> 31:24.790
Mike, I know
what you're tryin' to do.

31:24.824 --> 31:27.192
Now's not the time.

31:27.227 --> 31:30.229
Please go.

31:49.749 --> 31:54.169
Come in.

31:54.220 --> 31:55.954
You're not Louis Litt.

31:55.972 --> 31:58.557
No, I'm not. But if you're
expecting him to show up,

31:58.591 --> 32:01.009
it's gonna be a long wait.
You here to take his spot?

32:01.060 --> 32:03.795
I'll give you senior partner
right now.

32:03.813 --> 32:06.932
I'm here to tell you
you're not getting Versalife.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.934
I'm sorry,
I don't know who that is.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.186
It's the company
you tried to poach from me.

32:11.237 --> 32:13.471
- You seem upset.
- I'm not upset.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.274
I just wanted to remind you
you once told me

32:15.308 --> 32:18.026
I was a piece of shit for using
your daughter against you,

32:18.077 --> 32:20.362
but now you turn around
and use Louis against me?

32:20.413 --> 32:22.614
- No, that's not the same.
- It is to me.

32:22.648 --> 32:25.701
I may fight with him,
but he's still my family.

32:25.752 --> 32:28.653
- Then why did he leave?
- That's between me and Louis.

32:28.671 --> 32:32.624
I wanted Versalife, but it's
not worth gloating over.

32:32.658 --> 32:34.209
So why are you really here,
Harvey?

32:34.260 --> 32:36.178
I'm here to ask you
to take Louis anyway.

32:36.212 --> 32:37.713
And why would I do that?

32:37.764 --> 32:39.264
'Cause you're a smart man.

32:39.299 --> 32:42.885
If you do it, I'll owe you one.

32:42.936 --> 32:45.003
I don't need you owin' me one.

32:45.021 --> 32:47.539
Why don't you take the night
to think about it?

32:47.574 --> 32:48.807
'Cause if there's one thing
I've learned,

32:48.841 --> 32:52.361
you can never have
too many favors in the bank.

33:00.036 --> 33:01.320
You wanted to see me?

33:01.354 --> 33:03.872
I heard about Versalife.

33:03.907 --> 33:06.708
Good work.

33:06.743 --> 33:08.126
It wasn't you.

33:08.161 --> 33:09.661
No, it wasn't.

33:09.695 --> 33:12.331
You know I thought it was you.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.582
Harvey didn't tell me,

33:13.633 --> 33:15.884
but I didn't just
fall off the turnip truck.

33:15.919 --> 33:18.921
No, you didn't.

33:18.972 --> 33:20.538
What?

33:20.557 --> 33:24.542
Every damn time I think
there's no upside to having you,

33:24.561 --> 33:25.877
you do some shit
to make me think

33:25.895 --> 33:28.647
it's actually nice
to have you around.

33:28.681 --> 33:30.065
So, we're good?

33:30.099 --> 33:34.770
We're good after you
bill a few more hours tonight.

33:34.821 --> 33:36.355
Well, that's gonna
have to wait until later,

33:36.389 --> 33:39.557
because I am definitely
going out to celebrate.

33:39.576 --> 33:41.243
You've earned it.

33:41.277 --> 33:45.397
Jessica.

33:45.415 --> 33:50.168
She did what Harvey
would have done for you.

34:01.798 --> 34:04.082
- Jessica.
- Katrina.

34:04.100 --> 34:05.384
Is this about the...

34:05.418 --> 34:07.769
I can either fire you...

34:07.804 --> 34:09.920
or you can resign.

34:09.938 --> 34:13.190
The choice is yours.

34:13.226 --> 34:14.309
You know?

34:14.360 --> 34:16.561
I know.

34:16.594 --> 34:19.531
Then why are you being
so nice about it?

34:19.565 --> 34:21.933
Because letting you go
is enough.

34:21.951 --> 34:24.768
And you also don't want
to antagonize me,

34:24.786 --> 34:27.172
since I'll be working
for Robert Zane.

34:27.206 --> 34:30.125
You haven't heard?

34:30.159 --> 34:33.712
We got Versalife back.

34:33.746 --> 34:35.831
Louis won't be going to Zane,

34:35.882 --> 34:41.085
and neither will you.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.222
I wish you luck.

34:44.257 --> 34:45.623
You'll have my letter
of resignation on your desk

34:45.641 --> 34:46.641
in the morning.

35:22.753 --> 35:23.786
What took
<i>you</i> so long?

35:23.820 --> 35:25.338
What are you,
the bathroom monitor?

35:25.372 --> 35:27.990
Well, if I were, I'd say you'd
gone three times in an hour.

35:28.008 --> 35:30.660
Yes,
and this is our third drink.

35:30.678 --> 35:32.795
You know they have medicine
for that, right?

35:32.829 --> 35:33.829
You saying I'm old?

35:33.830 --> 35:35.098
Yes, but I'm also saying

35:35.132 --> 35:36.516
I know you haven't been goin'
to the bathroom.

35:36.550 --> 35:38.184
All right, you want the truth?

35:38.218 --> 35:39.302
I've been calling Donna.

35:39.336 --> 35:41.187
Oh my God, that is so great.

35:41.221 --> 35:43.389
You guys finally
decided to take the plunge.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.808
I wanted to know
if Robert Zane called me back.

35:45.842 --> 35:46.842
Called you back about what?

35:46.860 --> 35:48.728
I asked him to hire Louis
anyway.

35:48.779 --> 35:50.480
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.181
I even told him
if he did I'd owe him one.

35:52.199 --> 35:54.901
- Hmm.
- What?

35:54.952 --> 35:56.235
Oh, I'm just tryin'
to figure out at what point

35:56.287 --> 35:59.021
in the last week
you decided to become a pussy.

35:59.039 --> 36:02.492
Oh, so doing something nice
for someone makes you a pussy?

36:02.526 --> 36:04.127
- I didn't say that exactly.
- Yes, you did.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.528
Let's just go through
some of the nice things

36:05.546 --> 36:06.829
you've done for people.
Okay, you know what, Harvey?

36:06.863 --> 36:08.081
Guilty as charged.

36:08.132 --> 36:11.084
I am nice, and if that makes me
a pussy, then so be it.

36:11.135 --> 36:13.469
Then it's settled:
You're a nice pussy.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.255
Miss, can I get a cosmo
here for my friend?

36:16.307 --> 36:17.757
Go ahead, order another drink.

36:17.808 --> 36:18.925
Just be careful,
'cause you're gonna

36:18.976 --> 36:20.510
be in the bathroom
in another five minutes.

36:20.544 --> 36:22.095
You going back
to the prostate again?

36:22.146 --> 36:24.480
What, like you've never
repeated jokes before?

36:24.515 --> 36:26.882
- I have no idea what...
- What I'm talking about?

36:26.900 --> 36:28.217
Let's see uh, "you see,

36:28.235 --> 36:29.885
that's funny,
because blah-blah-blah,"

36:29.903 --> 36:32.188
or "by blah-blah-blah,
I mean blah-blah-blah."

36:32.222 --> 36:34.157
- Okay, I get it.
- Oh, I'm just getting started.

36:34.191 --> 36:36.075
I could do this all night.
Hey, you know what?

36:36.110 --> 36:37.390
Now I have to go
to the bathroom.

36:37.394 --> 36:39.895
Go for it.
Take your time, no rush.

36:39.913 --> 36:43.916
If it hurts, call someone.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.463
Louis, what
are you doing here?

36:57.514 --> 36:59.966
I'm waiting for Harvey.

37:00.017 --> 37:03.469
Harvey's not here.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.937
Then you'll have to do.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.639
Look, Louis,

37:06.690 --> 37:08.975
I know you've been
through a lot,

37:09.026 --> 37:10.276
but Harvey's gonna...

37:10.310 --> 37:12.812
I don't give a shit
what Harvey's gonna do.

37:12.863 --> 37:16.866
Okay, you're scaring me.

37:24.074 --> 37:26.325
You know what an Oscar
looks like?

37:26.377 --> 37:29.212
- What?
- Academy Award. Bald guy.

37:29.246 --> 37:31.798
I mean, of course
we all know what it looks like,

37:31.832 --> 37:33.716
but especially you,
you're an actress.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.117
It's the highest honor
in your field.

37:35.135 --> 37:37.837
I mean, of course you don't need
to be told what it is.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.423
- What are you talking about?
- The highest academic honor

37:40.457 --> 37:44.644
in Harvard law is
the Order of the Coif.

37:44.678 --> 37:47.313
You don't get a trophy.

37:47.347 --> 37:49.565
You get three things.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.985
You get a parchment
to hang on your wall,

37:53.020 --> 37:56.072
a medal to wear at graduation,

37:56.106 --> 37:58.641
and this.

37:58.659 --> 38:03.312
Now, this key
doesn't say "Order of the Coif."

38:03.330 --> 38:04.814
It doesn't say anything.

38:04.832 --> 38:06.282
It's just a symbol.

38:06.316 --> 38:07.617
What does that have
to do with Harvey?

38:07.651 --> 38:09.318
It doesn't.
It has to do with Mike.

38:09.336 --> 38:11.754
You know what, Louis?
It's been a long day, can...

38:11.789 --> 38:16.092
It's about to get longer.

38:16.126 --> 38:19.629
See, Mike asked me about this.

38:19.663 --> 38:23.332
And I thought he was...

38:23.350 --> 38:27.553
I thought he was trying to get
my mind off of my problems,

38:27.604 --> 38:29.639
but then he did it again.

38:29.673 --> 38:32.308
And it got me to thinking:

38:32.342 --> 38:36.863
Mike graduated magna cum laude.

38:36.897 --> 38:41.150
He's in Order of the Coif.

38:41.184 --> 38:43.703
But he didn't recognize this.

38:43.737 --> 38:46.038
So he forgot a stupid key.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.908
Mike Ross doesn't forget
anything.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.160
See, the reason
he didn't recognize this

38:51.194 --> 38:56.549
was because he never got one,
because...

38:56.583 --> 38:59.869
He didn't go to Harvard.

38:59.887 --> 39:02.037
Louis, we've been
down this road before.

39:02.055 --> 39:03.422
Mike is the Harvard database.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.224
But he's not in the yearbook,

39:05.259 --> 39:06.642
and according
to his credit report,

39:06.677 --> 39:09.228
his address during his law
school years was in New York.

39:09.263 --> 39:13.048
He even paid rent the first
of the month in person.

39:13.066 --> 39:16.352
- Well, I'm sure there's an...
- Sit down!

39:16.386 --> 39:19.889
Last year, you told me not to
tell Sheila about Mike's file.

39:19.907 --> 39:23.075
You acted like you cared
about me.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.412
You didn't give a shit about me.

39:26.446 --> 39:28.364
You cared about you!

39:28.398 --> 39:29.398
And Harvey!
No.

39:29.416 --> 39:30.583
- And Mike!
- No.

39:30.617 --> 39:32.285
- And Jessica!
- Louis, that's not true!

39:32.336 --> 39:34.704
Well, let's call Sheila
right now.

39:34.738 --> 39:36.756
I know all of the numbers
by heart.

39:36.790 --> 39:39.125
I mean, she may not
be interested in me anymore,

39:39.176 --> 39:41.711
but she will definitely be
interested in a fraud claiming

39:41.745 --> 39:44.714
that he went to Harvard.

39:51.138 --> 39:55.424
I'm sorry.

39:55.442 --> 40:00.763
You're sorry?

40:00.781 --> 40:04.784
You've been lying to me
since the day Mike Ross arrived.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.489
I knew Harvey and Jessica
never really accepted me,

40:10.541 --> 40:12.825
but I thought
you were different.

40:12.876 --> 40:14.827
I thought you were my friend.

40:14.878 --> 40:19.782
- I am your friend, Louis.
- No, you're not.

40:19.800 --> 40:25.171
And don't you ever
say that to me again.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.757
Where are you going?

40:27.791 --> 40:31.928
To see your friend Jessica.

40:37.818 --> 40:40.820
Louis knows.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.778
Louis.

40:48.812 --> 40:50.332
I know you're a stickler
for the rules,

40:50.364 --> 40:52.815
so I figured I'd just
come by to return my I.D.

40:52.833 --> 40:54.149
You want an explanation.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.785
I want to see you
perp walked through the bullpen

40:55.819 --> 40:59.538
with your pretty little jacket
draped over your handcuffs.

40:59.590 --> 41:03.259
But until then, yeah,
I'll take an explanation.

41:03.293 --> 41:07.263
When I found out the truth
about Mike Ross,

41:07.297 --> 41:09.599
it had already been done.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.218
By Harvey?

41:12.269 --> 41:15.688
Right after he
made senior partner over me?

41:15.722 --> 41:17.940
That's when he hired the fraud?

41:17.975 --> 41:19.442
That's the correct timeline,
right?

41:19.476 --> 41:21.027
Yes.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.445
So instead of turning him in,

41:22.479 --> 41:24.614
you cover it up.
Louis-

41:24.648 --> 41:26.983
and the one time
that I do something...

41:27.017 --> 41:30.953
you don't cover it up at all.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.622
You throw me to the wolves.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.740
I saved you from the wolves.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.543
Then I ask you
for the smallest gesture,

41:37.577 --> 41:39.829
just to allow my career
to continue with dignity,

41:39.863 --> 41:44.667
and you couldn't muster
the tiniest shred of compassion.

41:46.803 --> 41:48.421
What do you want me to say?

41:48.472 --> 41:52.875
I want you to tell me
you're a liar!

41:52.893 --> 41:56.896
And a hypocrite!

42:00.600 --> 42:04.603
I want you to say you're sorry.

42:08.158 --> 42:13.946
I am a liar.

42:13.997 --> 42:18.000
And I am a hypocrite.

42:20.236 --> 42:23.456
But I will not say I'm sorry,

42:23.507 --> 42:27.743
because I did what I did
to protect this firm.

42:27.761 --> 42:30.262
Well, looks like the captain's
about to go down with her ship.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.465
Bullshit.

42:32.516 --> 42:34.016
You want something.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.634
Oh, I told you.
I want to see you in...

42:35.686 --> 42:37.553
In handcuffs?

42:37.587 --> 42:41.607
If that were true, the police
would be here instead of you.

42:41.641 --> 42:46.595
No, you wanted to see me squirm

42:46.613 --> 42:50.616
before asking me
for what you really want.

42:53.403 --> 42:56.455
I'm not gonna
give you the satisfaction,

42:56.490 --> 43:00.543
so you might as well
spit it out.

43:00.577 --> 43:02.878
You asked me what I wanted
once before, and I told you,

43:02.913 --> 43:07.616
and then you told me
that I couldn't have it.

43:07.634 --> 43:11.971
But now I can.

43:12.005 --> 43:14.840
Pearson...

43:14.891 --> 43:19.395
Specter...

43:19.429 --> 43:21.347
