WEBVTT

03:52.941 --> 03:54.817
Oh, sorry.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.737
Vera?
Bob Leckie.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.822
I'm your neighbor
from across the street.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.741
I know who you are, Bob.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.995
I thought I was going shopping,
but then I passed Saint Mary's

04:06.163 --> 04:08.706
and thought I'd pray instead.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.500
I joined the Marines.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.170
Thought I'd do my bit.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.422
Fifth in line.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.425
Well, if I don't see you
before you go...

04:19.593 --> 04:22.219
take care of yourself.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.976
Um, wait, Vera,
let me get that for you.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.354
Oh, thank you.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.899
Maybe I'll write you.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.443
All right.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.037
Basilone!
Over here.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.830
Excuse me, folks.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.375
- I miss anything?
- Nah.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.002
The movie hasn't
started yet.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.797
Don't tell me
I missed this thing.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.633
- Chesty's come and gone.
- Yeah, just missed him.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.218
Come on, did I
fuck this up or what?

05:02.386 --> 05:04.136
- Oh, yeah.
- Man: Attention on deck!

05:09.768 --> 05:11.727
Carry on.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.438
Fuck you.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.574
The uniform that you wear

05:25.742 --> 05:28.953
and the globe-and-anchor
emblem that you have earned

05:29.121 --> 05:32.915
will make the difference
between the freedom of the world

05:33.083 --> 05:35.584
and its enslavement.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.672
December 7th was
quite a day

05:39.840 --> 05:41.924
in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.343
On the same day,
December 8th

05:44.511 --> 05:46.762
on the other side of
the International Dateline,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.724
in places called Guam, Wake,

05:49.891 --> 05:52.309
the Malay Peninsula,

05:52.477 --> 05:55.688
Hong Kong and
the Philippine Islands

05:55.856 --> 05:59.483
were also attacked
by the army, air force

05:59.651 --> 06:03.571
and navy of
the empire of Japan.

06:03.739 --> 06:06.991
The Japanese
are in the process

06:07.159 --> 06:09.076
of taking half
of the world.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.911
And they mean
to keep it

06:11.079 --> 06:13.998
with death from
the air, land and sea.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.168
But here is what the Japs
are not expecting:

06:17.335 --> 06:20.463
the United States
Marine Corps.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.592
Now never mind Europe-

06:24.760 --> 06:27.136
the Nazis, Mussolini.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.931
Hitler is not gonna
be ourjob,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.851
not until they can't
whip him without us.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.022
The Pacific will be
our theater of war.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.025
The Marines will do battle
with the Japs

06:41.193 --> 06:44.195
on tiny specks of turf
that we have never heard of.

06:44.362 --> 06:48.783
You noncommissioned officers,

06:48.950 --> 06:52.203
you are the sinew
and the muscle of the corps.

06:52.370 --> 06:56.957
The orders come from the brass
and you get it done.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.960
And whenever
this war is over,

07:00.128 --> 07:02.630
when we have swept upon
the main islands of Japan

07:02.798 --> 07:06.634
and destroyed every scrap
of that empire,

07:06.802 --> 07:09.303
the strategy will have been
that of others.

07:09.471 --> 07:13.808
The victory will
have been won by you-

07:13.975 --> 07:16.977
you, the NCOs,

07:17.145 --> 07:20.439
with the chevrons on your
sleeves and the instincts in your guts

07:20.607 --> 07:22.983
and the blood on your boots.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.075
Those of you who are lucky enough
to get home for Christmas,

07:31.243 --> 07:33.536
hold your loved ones dearly

07:33.703 --> 07:36.622
and join them in prayers
for peace on earth

07:36.790 --> 07:38.999
and goodwill toward all men.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.877
And then report back here

07:42.045 --> 07:45.631
ready to sail across
God's vast ocean

07:45.799 --> 07:47.883
where we will meet
our enemy

07:48.051 --> 07:50.636
and kill them all.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.056
Merry Christmas.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.642
Happy 1942.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.312
Man:
Squad, atten-hut!

08:00.480 --> 08:02.648
Carry on.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.001
I got it, Ma.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.712
Man:
Angelo? Angelo?

08:24.880 --> 08:26.505
- Hey!
- Where you fellas been?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.550
We had to walk from the station
and we took the wrong street.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.594
Yeah, Manny had the wrong street.
You believe that?

08:31.761 --> 08:34.680
Get in here.
Come on, come on.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.515
Salute!

08:36.683 --> 08:38.726
Come here.
Hey, everybody!

08:38.894 --> 08:41.687
- This is JP and Manny!
- All: Hey!

08:41.855 --> 08:43.314
Hey, everybody.
How you doin'?

08:43.481 --> 08:46.442
Nice to see you.
Good to see you.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.527
Thank you, sir.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.904
JP.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.871
Your wife is
so beautiful!

08:59.039 --> 09:03.250
I wish my sons
could marry someone this beautiful.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.460
- Eh!
- Ma!

09:04.628 --> 09:05.961
Manny:
You sound like my mama.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.963
She could not understand how
I could get through high school

09:08.131 --> 09:11.133
- without that wedding date set.
- I could.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.635
All right.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.346
Everybody listen up,
please.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.348
JP Morgan,

09:17.515 --> 09:19.350
Manny Rodriguez,
welcome to our home.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.185
We're happy you
could join us tonight.

09:21.353 --> 09:25.272
Soon two of my brothers are
leaving to serve their country.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.483
And George,
we're losing sleep wondering

09:27.651 --> 09:31.070
what Marine Corps boot camp
is gonna do to you.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.657
My brother John, you've been there
rough and ready for years.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.201
You were in the Philippines
and came back to join the Marines

09:37.369 --> 09:39.912
because you wanted to be
the best and first in.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.957
When all this is over,

09:43.124 --> 09:45.167
let's say
a year from tonight,

09:45.335 --> 09:47.169
we'll sit down at
this table again

09:47.337 --> 09:49.088
for a welcome-home feast.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.423
To all of you,

09:51.591 --> 09:55.344
just get the job done

09:55.512 --> 09:57.304
and come home to us.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.562
- Salute.
- All: Salute.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.482
Oh!

10:08.650 --> 10:10.150
Those cannoli
for the guests!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.778
- He won't catch him.
- Yeah, you know it.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.962
Depot announcer:
Bus to Rochester leaves in 20 minutes.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.464
Please have
your tickets ready.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.553
Thanks for the ride, Dad.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.014
Must be a branch or something
stuck under the wheel.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.308
It's pulling to one side.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.812
Ech!

10:49.441 --> 10:50.899
Thanks for the ride.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.319
Oh yeah, sure.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.030
You hardly packed a thing.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.283
Final call for
the 6:45 to Newark.

10:59.451 --> 11:02.745
Marine's outfit includes everything
from bayonets to socks.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.331
I just wish I could have
brought my typewriter.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.291
Can't see why
you need that.

11:07.459 --> 11:12.296
Oh, I thought I might fight
by day and write by night, Dad.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.007
Can't see a thing.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.885
Oh, I hope I don't
need a new axle.

11:18.053 --> 11:19.762
No way I'll get one.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.722
Yeah.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.517
There's a war on.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.854
Everybody's got to
make sacrifices.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.732
Your mother said I was
a fool not to buy a Ford.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.692
Hope she's not right.

11:33.860 --> 11:38.030
Bus 45 and 73, direct service
to New York City,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.616
loading at depots 5 and 7.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.413
Well, that's it, Dad.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.291
I gotta go.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.017
Goodbye, son.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.152
Son-

13:00.238 --> 13:03.740
Eugene, I- I'm sorry.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.559
Murmur's still there.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.069
The boy's disappointed,
Mary Frank.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.864
I'm his mother.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.235
Churchill over radio:
... at Pearl Harbor

14:21.402 --> 14:23.987
in the Pacific Islands,
in the Philippines,

14:24.155 --> 14:26.698
in Malaya and
the Dutch East Indies,

14:26.866 --> 14:30.744
they must now know
the stakes are mortal.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.580
When we look at the resources
of the United States

14:33.748 --> 14:36.625
and the British Empire
compared to those of Japan,

14:36.793 --> 14:38.335
when we...

14:41.631 --> 14:45.133
...we have so long
valiantly withstood invasion.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.187
Gene, supper's ready.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.820
Deacon, you stay!

15:11.661 --> 15:15.664
You're 18, Eugene.
You don't need your father's permission.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.457
I can't go
against him, Sid.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.960
When do you leave?

15:20.128 --> 15:23.505
I'm on the 6:00 AM
train to Atlanta.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.173
Uh, here.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.510
Got you something.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.512
"Barrack-Room Ballads"
by Rudyard Kipling.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.180
Thank you, Gene,
but I didn't-

15:32.348 --> 15:34.141
It's just if you need something
to read on the train or...

15:34.309 --> 15:35.976
when you ship out.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.772
I wish we
were going together.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.108
Yeah, well, you take care
of yourself, greaser.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.902
Oh. You don't have to
worry about me.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.144
Get it while it's hot.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.481
Get your plates out.
Get your plates out.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.358
Today's the day, Marines!

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
This is it.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.570
Today's the day!

16:28.738 --> 16:30.530
Get moving.
Don't wait for a seat.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.366
A lot of Marines to feed!
Move move move!

16:32.533 --> 16:36.036
Release it up! The quicker we eat,
the quicker we get topside,

16:36.204 --> 16:37.829
the quicker we get ashore.
Come on, Marines.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.915
Let's go go go!

16:40.083 --> 16:41.708
Oranges coming through.
Hey, come on, guys!

16:41.876 --> 16:43.752
I worked hard
for these oranges!

16:43.920 --> 16:47.714
- Dessert!
- Oh, hey!

16:47.882 --> 16:50.175
Make sure you save
one of those for me.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.806
I just want off this goddamn rust bucket!
I can't hear myself think.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.141
At least they give you a good
meaI before your send-off.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.935
Yeah, like
the electric chair.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.436
- But you, Runner?
- Yes?

17:01.604 --> 17:04.064
You have won a trip
to a tropical paradise.

17:04.232 --> 17:07.442
Oh, "Guadal Kenel"...
"Guada... "

17:07.610 --> 17:08.985
I still can't pronounce it.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.987
Yeah, well, whatever it's called,
you guys are lucky I'm here

17:11.155 --> 17:14.533
'cause I'm planning to take out
an entire Jap regiment all by myself!

17:15.952 --> 17:17.327
How you plan on doing that,
Sergeant York?

17:17.495 --> 17:20.038
Line 'em up, mow 'em down.
Real turkey shoot!

17:20.206 --> 17:22.207
I got a feeling it's gonna be a little
more complicated than that.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.667
No, it's gonna be
a turkey shoot.

17:23.835 --> 17:24.960
Can someone remind me
why we're here again?

17:25.128 --> 17:27.212
We're here to keep
the Japs out of Australia.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.258
- No, we're here to keep the Japs-
- Something about shipping lanes.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.722
No, guys, guys, guys, guys.
Professor Leckie, enlighten us.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.391
Wanna know why we're here?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.268
Mm-hmm.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.482
"Without a sign, his sword
the brave man draws

17:47.650 --> 17:51.111
and asks no omen
but his country's cause. "

17:55.241 --> 17:57.659
Man: Drink up!
Last chance for fresh water!

17:57.827 --> 18:00.495
- Give me back my smokes.
- Leckie, you gotta stop this.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.831
Let's go, boys.
Everybody on deck.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.124
Let's move!

18:04.292 --> 18:06.251
Topside right now!

18:06.419 --> 18:08.003
Wrap it up now.
Get your gear.

18:08.171 --> 18:12.466
Everybody topside for
a pre-landing briefing.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.802
Forget all the horseshit
you've heard about the Japs.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.972
They had their turn.
Now it's our turn.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.892
The treacherous bastards
may have started this war,

18:22.059 --> 18:24.644
but I promise you
we will finish it!

18:24.812 --> 18:26.313
All:
Yeah!

18:26.481 --> 18:29.316
Slant-eyed monkeys
want to use that shit island

18:29.484 --> 18:31.318
and its airfield
to kill us!

18:31.486 --> 18:33.445
We'll yank
the surviving Japs

18:33.613 --> 18:36.615
out of their shit-filled holes
by their yellow balls.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.576
They'll go round-eyed
when the first American plane

18:39.744 --> 18:41.161
lands on their airfield!

18:41.329 --> 18:43.246
Heads down in
the boats!

18:43.414 --> 18:48.168
Hit the beach. Keep moving till you
rendezvous point some primary objectives.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.046
When you see the Japs,
kill 'em all!

18:51.214 --> 18:52.547
All:
Yeah!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.633
- Go!
- Let's go get 'em!

18:58.429 --> 19:02.182
Move it, move it! Hands on the vertical,
feet on the horizontaI.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.476
Make it tight!
Come on!

19:10.525 --> 19:13.151
Hand on the vertical
down there!

19:40.179 --> 19:42.931
I could really use
a stiff one right now.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.067
Go get 'em, navy!

20:43.618 --> 20:46.077
Hoof it up to the beach!
Spread out!

20:46.245 --> 20:48.413
Man:
All right, let's go! Now!

20:48.581 --> 20:50.707
Go go go!

20:51.876 --> 20:54.502
Hit shore, hit shore!

21:07.308 --> 21:10.518
Man:
What took you so long?

21:10.686 --> 21:13.271
Welcome to Guadalcanal.

21:22.865 --> 21:25.325
Man:
Move it up the beach, Marines.

21:39.674 --> 21:44.469
Ah, now I've got you,
you son of a bitch.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.643
Hey, now what
do I do?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.895
I think the islanders use
a machete or a rock.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.982
Try using your head, Chuckler.
It's big and rocklike.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.988
Hey, Johnny Reb.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.078
Man: For what it's worth,
CorporaI Dobson says

22:10.246 --> 22:13.373
the Japs might have
poisoned the coconuts.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.542
They poisoned
a billion coconuts?

22:15.710 --> 22:18.378
Oh, shit!
My hand!

22:18.546 --> 22:20.171
- Excuse me.
- Son of a bitch!

22:20.339 --> 22:23.508
What happened?
Hey, Doc!

22:26.345 --> 22:30.974
Intelligence has it the Japs
moved back into the jungle.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.727
Clean the sand out of your weapons.
We move in three minutes.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.023
Let's go find some Japs.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.576
Oh!

25:36.744 --> 25:39.078
Gibson, you okay?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.747
Fuck.
I'm fine.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.415
You all right?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.000
Thanks.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.490
Goddamn bastards.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.753
Keep it moving.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.811
Man:
Take cover!

28:10.147 --> 28:12.982
- Go go!
- Man: Cease fire!

28:13.150 --> 28:16.903
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

28:38.425 --> 28:40.885
Man:
Son of a bitch.

28:44.598 --> 28:48.017
He went to take a piss.
Somebody opened up.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.939
Did he say the password?

28:53.107 --> 28:55.358
I don't know.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.777
Let's start walking.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.029
We're moving to
the top of the ridge.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.369
We're moving!

29:22.428 --> 29:25.638
Jameson:
Corrigan, Stone, get over here.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.058
We've been chasing geese, boys.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.769
That's the 5th Marines
on the airfield.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.149
Guess we took the airfield.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.818
Well, let's go home.

29:38.986 --> 29:43.906
LPs at 300yds,
no fires, two-hour watches.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.909
Let's assume the Japs are
watching right now,

29:47.077 --> 29:48.327
preparing to come at us.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.413
Assume?

29:50.581 --> 29:52.457
They are.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.379
Let the little yellow
bastards come.

30:02.551 --> 30:05.761
- Jesus Christ.
- Unbelievable.

30:09.266 --> 30:13.352
Lord, can you imagine being
on one of those ships?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.314
Looks like
the 4th of July.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.150
Guys?
30 cal ammo.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.943
Thank you,
thank you.

30:21.111 --> 30:24.822
- Hope it was a fucking Jap ship.
- It was- it's gotta be.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.203
That's AdmiraI Turner
blowing the whole Jap fleet

30:30.370 --> 30:32.371
to the bottom of
the channeI.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.376
I love your optimism.

30:39.296 --> 30:43.174
Oh, we're killin' 'em.

30:52.392 --> 30:56.020
Son of a bitch.
Where's the navy?

30:56.188 --> 30:57.730
Gone.

30:57.898 --> 31:02.443
We lost four cruisers.
Turner took everyone left

31:02.611 --> 31:04.153
and headed for open sea.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.030
We're it for now.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.367
The Elliot's with Turner?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.369
Zero crashed
into her midship.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.454
They couldn't control the fire
so they scuttled her.

31:13.622 --> 31:14.872
Bon voyage.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.333
Yeah, well, she went down
with half the battalion's ammo,

31:17.501 --> 31:19.043
most of our grub
and medical supplies

31:19.211 --> 31:21.837
and all our ass-wipe.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.465
Let's dig in, Marines!

31:24.633 --> 31:26.884
Start diggin' in.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.562
- Here.
- Hey, Phillips.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.813
Want some?

31:38.981 --> 31:41.315
It's Jap wine
left behind.

31:41.483 --> 31:44.318
It's made out of donkey piss
but it's not bad.

31:48.490 --> 31:52.243
The Jap navy is right over
the horizon, Phillips.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.453
If not now, then when?

31:54.621 --> 31:57.707
If you can't fight 'em drunk,
don't fight 'em at all.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.217
There you go.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.386
Man: Smoking lamps out!
Pass it down!

32:10.554 --> 32:12.513
- Smoking lamps out.
- Smoking lamps out!

32:12.681 --> 32:14.015
Smoking lamps out.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.475
Smoking lamps out!

32:41.126 --> 32:43.127
- What what?
- Stay low! Stay low!

32:43.295 --> 32:46.172
They're just trying to
spot our position so hold your fire.

32:46.340 --> 32:49.592
Hold your fire. They're just trying to
spot our position.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.385
Hold your fire.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.387
Keep your head down!

32:53.555 --> 32:56.223
They're just trying to
spot our position.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.142
Hold your fire.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.338
Corrigan:
Jesus Christ.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.423
There are thousands
of them.

33:29.591 --> 33:32.593
Man:
The whole damn Japanese Empire.

33:32.761 --> 33:33.928
You four over here.

33:34.096 --> 33:37.598
Coconut plantation
used a cove about 10 miles up.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.767
They're probably
headed there.

33:39.935 --> 33:43.396
Don't get too comfortable
in your holes.

34:09.923 --> 34:13.342
Set in along here.
Watch the opposite bank.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.388
Let's go-
put the hole right here.

34:24.104 --> 34:27.273
Man:
That's good. Keep it coming.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.775
Keep going.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.779
Corrigan:
"A" company made contact

34:33.947 --> 34:35.948
three miles east.

34:36.116 --> 34:39.410
Destroy any letters you have
with any dates...

34:39.578 --> 34:41.662
or addresses.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.177
Man: We got movement!
We got movement!

35:16.990 --> 35:18.866
Hey, look look look!

35:36.301 --> 35:38.552
Get back to your positions!

35:42.599 --> 35:44.809
- Man: Hanging!
- Fire!

36:00.158 --> 36:03.202
Fire!

36:03.370 --> 36:06.664
They're flanking us!
Stand back!

36:09.209 --> 36:11.544
Oh, we gotta move!
We gotta move!

36:11.711 --> 36:13.879
We gotta move over
to the left flank!

36:15.715 --> 36:17.883
Stand back!

36:23.765 --> 36:25.140
Come on!

36:25.308 --> 36:27.309
Come on,
just a few more yards!

36:52.002 --> 36:54.420
60, follow me!

36:55.422 --> 36:58.340
Move into
the forward position!

36:58.508 --> 37:02.052
Skipper!
Skipper, are you okay?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.349
God damn it.

37:07.517 --> 37:10.561
He's lost it. Come on!
Keep moving, keep moving!

37:10.729 --> 37:12.479
Get up here!

37:17.319 --> 37:20.571
- Oh, get up!
- Move!

37:41.718 --> 37:43.719
Left, hold up!
Get in there!

37:43.887 --> 37:45.179
There!

37:49.392 --> 37:52.353
We gotta move! We gotta move!

37:57.192 --> 38:00.527
- We gotta keep moving!
- Yeah! Yeah!

38:03.865 --> 38:06.075
Okay, let's go!
Let's go!

38:11.539 --> 38:13.207
Block them right, God damn it!
Block them right.

38:18.922 --> 38:20.965
Get those bastards runnin'!

38:21.132 --> 38:23.300
All right, ready?
Go go go!

38:27.430 --> 38:28.847
Clear!

38:36.272 --> 38:37.898
Ahhh!

39:14.811 --> 39:18.063
Man: Ammo resupplies
at the collection point.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.607
Smitty, resupply
down the line.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.908
Hey, ammo.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.914
Look at 'em all.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.209
I mean, we- we-
we chewed 'em up.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.420
They just kept
on coming.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.716
A real turkey shoot.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.304
Lucky.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.938
Corpsman,
we got a live one here.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.906
Stick a pin in him, Doc.

40:15.705 --> 40:19.208
- Shit!
- Fucking yellow monkeys!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.545
Shit.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.811
Man: Let's have some fun with
that son of a bitch!

40:41.481 --> 40:43.440
- Ahh!
- Get that fucker!

40:43.608 --> 40:46.026
- Whoo!
- Ahhh!

40:46.194 --> 40:50.489
Ahhh! Ahhh!

41:14.597 --> 41:17.307
Where's your Tojo now?

41:20.353 --> 41:23.021
Run, fucker!

41:31.406 --> 41:33.907
Marine:
Hey, what'd you do that for?

41:43.042 --> 41:45.836
Man:
Gather any papers for S-2.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.213
Jesus, the smell.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.257
They got Rivers,

41:50.425 --> 41:52.176
Morley, Abbott,

41:52.343 --> 41:54.928
Marton, McDougal.

41:55.096 --> 41:58.098
Stanley's blinded.

41:58.266 --> 42:01.226
Captain Jameson's
been relieved.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.647
I better get started on
the letters to their families.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.400
- Want a smoke?
- Thanks.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.196
- Oh, and Jeurgins?
- Sir?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.156
That's a good job
moving around last night.

42:14.324 --> 42:16.992
- Sir.
- Got you promoted to corporal.

42:20.997 --> 42:23.040
Well, we've lost Lew.

42:24.292 --> 42:27.252
"Yes, ma'am,
I am a corporal. "

42:35.136 --> 42:39.139
Oh, shit, these must be
the bastards who took Guam.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.142
I'll be damned.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.121
Robert's voice:
"Dear Vera,

43:44.289 --> 43:47.791
it seems a lifetime since
we met outside Saint Mary's.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.168
This great undertaking
for God and country

43:50.336 --> 43:52.296
has landed us in
a tropical paradise

43:52.463 --> 43:54.464
somewhere in what
Jack London refers to

43:54.632 --> 43:56.633
as 'those
terrible Solomons. '

43:56.801 --> 43:58.635
It is a Garden of Eden.

43:58.803 --> 44:02.139
The jungle holds both beauty
and terror in its depths,

44:02.307 --> 44:04.766
most terrible of which
is man.

44:04.934 --> 44:08.103
We have met the enemy and have learned
nothing more about him.

44:08.271 --> 44:12.274
I have, however, learned
some things about myself.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.359
There are things men
can do to one another

44:14.527 --> 44:17.446
that are sobering
to the souI.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.781
It is one thing to reconcile
these things with God,

44:19.949 --> 44:23.243
but another to square it
with yourself. "

44:29.042 --> 44:30.834
How long you been
sitting on this one?

44:31.002 --> 44:32.002
A week.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.671
Wanted to get it
really ripe for you.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.257
How kind.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.595
Next time don't let it
wait so long.

44:41.763 --> 44:43.305
Man:
This is what they call Guadalcanal.

44:43.473 --> 44:45.349
Runner:
Finally, our reinforcements.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.186
- 'Morning, boys.
- Shit, it's Chesty Puller.

44:49.354 --> 44:52.439
Look at the 7th, all
dressed up for Sunday school.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.066
Hey, you guys forget
to set the alarm?

44:54.233 --> 44:56.818
- Yeah, where you been?
- Up with the sun in Samoa

44:56.986 --> 44:59.821
- screwing your girlfriend.
Oh!

44:59.989 --> 45:01.907
Hoosier: I have a girlfriend?
Lucky me.

45:02.075 --> 45:03.450
Filthy, just like you are.

45:03.618 --> 45:05.660
Hey, Colonel Puller,
where you headin'?

45:05.828 --> 45:07.996
Tokyo.
Care to join us?

45:08.164 --> 45:10.916
I don't know. It's a ways, sir.
Write us when you get there.

45:11.084 --> 45:13.210
- I will!
- You guys step aside.

45:13.378 --> 45:16.505
- The real Marines are here now.
- And have been here for some time.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.714
All:
Yeah!

45:17.882 --> 45:21.718
- 7th Marines!
- Welcome to the war, fellas.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.139
You seen those guys?

45:26.307 --> 45:28.100
They look like they been
through the wringer.

45:28.267 --> 45:31.311
That's one way of
putting it.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.151
"Best wishes, Father.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.195
Your mother would
like to know

45:40.363 --> 45:43.073
if you want us to send you
your dress-blue uniform. "

45:44.826 --> 45:46.993
Must think we get a lot
of fancy-dress balls around here.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.995
Hey, if we have one,
can I be your date?

45:49.163 --> 45:51.081
You are ugly.
I want Hoosier.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.041
Take a number.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.918
Hey, Johnny Reb,
it's your turn.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.964
This one here is from
a buddy of mine back in Mobile.

46:01.050 --> 46:04.719
"Dear Sid, I hope this gets
to you before your birthday.

46:04.887 --> 46:06.972
You wouldn't recognize
home now.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.058
Thousands of workers are
pouring into the shipyards.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.394
The Gulf is blacked out now
because of the U-boats.

46:12.562 --> 46:14.312
Your sister and I went-"

46:14.480 --> 46:16.189
- Sister?
- All: Aww!

46:16.357 --> 46:20.569
"Your sister and I went down to see
the wreckage of a ship they sunk.

46:20.736 --> 46:22.571
She's worried about you,
of course, but I told her

46:22.738 --> 46:26.324
a greaser like yourself is
too crafty for the Japs.

46:26.492 --> 46:30.162
Truth is, you're
the lucky one, Sid.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.247
You'll never have that
nagging thought

46:32.415 --> 46:34.583
that you let your family,
your friends,

46:34.750 --> 46:35.876
and your country down.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.545
Because that's what
I'm afraid of. "

46:38.713 --> 46:42.132
Gear up!
Gun patrol, on your feet.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.050
- Let's go.
- Men: All right, that's it.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.470
Hey, finish it.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.557
"So I'll leave you knowing
that like the poem says,

46:50.725 --> 46:52.392
'You're a better man
than I am, Gunga Din. '

46:52.560 --> 46:56.897
Your humble and obedient
servant, Eugene Sledge. "

47:04.947 --> 47:06.948
So your friend wants
to be a Marine?

47:07.116 --> 47:11.036
Yeah, but his father won't let him.
He's got a heart murmur.

47:11.204 --> 47:14.247
Ah, a murmuring heart.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.333
Hey, when's your
birthday, Sid?

47:16.501 --> 47:18.335
It was a couple
weeks ago.

47:18.503 --> 47:19.920
How old are you?

47:20.087 --> 47:21.421
18.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.381
Happy birthday.
