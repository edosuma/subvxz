The bear hug
is not very showy.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.622
But it is well executed.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.591
You win, bro. You win!

10:26.593 --> 10:28.593
Just let us go!

10:28.595 --> 10:30.261
Not until you say it!

10:30.596 --> 10:31.896
(GROANS)

10:31.898 --> 10:34.065
Real wrestling truly
is a noble sport.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.801
Thank you, Cyborg,
for showing us the light.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.403
No, thank you.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.672
For this!

10:40.674 --> 10:42.740
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

10:42.742 --> 10:44.475
That's right. Who's the champ?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.244
I'm the champ! Woo!

10:46.246 --> 10:48.680
<i>That's what happens when</i>
<i>you try to stop me!</i>

10:48.682 --> 10:51.082
<i>All you kids out there, I want</i>
<i>you to eat your veggies,</i>

10:51.084 --> 10:52.817
<i>I want you drinking</i>
<i>that almond milk.</i>

10:52.819 --> 10:54.585
<i>Stay in school! Woo!</i>

10:54.587 --> 10:55.987
Ow!

10:58.891 --> 11:01.092
