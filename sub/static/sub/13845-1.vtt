WEBVTT

02:25.228 --> 02:26.968
Look, Leah, a mushroom.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.827
Look what I found... a treasure.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.332
Leah: It's a magical day.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.759
It must mean something.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.091
It's buried treasure.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.097
You can't leave the box empty.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.553
It's bad luck.

03:05.852 --> 03:06.852
I'm not afraid.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.978
I'm gonna make a
bracelet out of these.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.948
It's a magical day!

03:59.448 --> 04:00.448
Hurry up.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.490
We're going to be late.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.238
We're going to miss the plane.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.569
Don't worry.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.304
The plane's not gonna
leave without us.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.328
Leah: Where's Dylan?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.127
Where's Dylan?

04:16.548 --> 04:17.913
Come on, Leah, we have to go.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.612
Leah!

04:42.866 --> 04:45.608
Leah!

04:45.911 --> 04:47.013
Dylan: Leah and I had

04:47.037 --> 04:49.904
a fantastic summer together.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.527
But Leah's father
got transferred,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.241
and they had to move.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.752
I never heard from
her or saw her again.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.733
A

05:24.032 --> 05:25.863
Yeah.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.026
Are you on your way home?

05:29.329 --> 05:29.909
Ok.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.205
Great.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.498
Yeah.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.576
No, nothing.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.537
Nothing special.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.247
Yeah.

05:38.547 --> 05:39.547
Ok.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.520
Can you hear me?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.111
Dylan?

06:05.407 --> 06:06.487
Dylan, what's going on?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.398
Talk to me.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.702
Dylan!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.531
What's going on?

06:11.830 --> 06:15.539
Dylan, talk to me.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.539
Dylan, please.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.041
What's going on?

06:18.336 --> 06:19.496
Dylan.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.002
Dylan, talk to me.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.436
Talk to me.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.942
Dylan!

06:44.237 --> 06:45.898
Dylan.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.666
Call 911.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.078
Call 911.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.086
Is he dead?

07:04.382 --> 07:06.498
Is he dead?

07:06.801 --> 07:08.112
It's the Rolls-Royce
that hit him.

07:08.136 --> 07:08.750
I saw it.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.054
I'm a witness.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.763
Is he breathing?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.067
Is he ok?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.739
Is he ok?

08:55.035 --> 08:55.524
Ok.

08:55.827 --> 08:56.942
Ok, calm down.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.406
I'll be right there.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.558
He's in critical condition.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.726
Unconscious.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.145
And it does not look good.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.236
We were on the phone
when he was hit.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.784
Can you hear me now?

10:30.088 --> 10:31.088
No, he can't hear you.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.338
He suffered extreme head trauma.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.593
He's my good friend.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.385
Our director of neurology will
be here in a minute to see him.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.472
Excuse me.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.864
He's very weak.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.821
Semi-comatose.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
It's very serious.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.665
He isn't my patient, but
let me know how he's doing,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.080
and I'll check on him later.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.253
Don't stay too long.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.009
He needs plenty
of rest and quiet.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.666
Dr. rosin?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.581
Yes, this is Dr. Allan.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.673
I'm at your patient's
bed, and he's not here.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.587
Did you discharge him?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.051
I didn't discharge him.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.011
He should be in his bed.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.553
I'll check on him.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.959
What are you doing home?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.965
You're supposed to
be in a hospital.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.843
I let myself out.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.299
Help me.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.599
Help me.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.987
Well, he seems to be fine.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.201
As a matter of
fact, he's working

18:08.504 --> 18:09.835
at his desk on his next book.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.183
Oh.

18:24.687 --> 18:25.687
Oh.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.433
Leave me alone.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.022
I've got work to do.

18:36.824 --> 18:39.190
I know, I know, your deadlines.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.493
I've got deadlines.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.738
I'm not signing it.

18:42.038 --> 18:42.572
That's it.

18:42.872 --> 18:43.872
Leave me alone.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.830
Do not call me anymore.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.161
I'll call you.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.133
Dylan: I have
a damn master's degree

18:58.429 --> 19:00.636
in computer science,
and I turned

19:00.931 --> 19:02.762
out to be a writer of novels.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.764
All that's coming to an end now.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.692
Can I offer you a drink?

19:18.991 --> 19:21.482
No thanks.

19:21.786 --> 19:25.324
Are you sure I can't offer
you a little drink, huh?

19:25.623 --> 19:26.623
No.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.416
We don't have sex anymore.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.832
Do you realize that?

19:38.135 --> 19:39.671
Where did that come from?

19:39.970 --> 19:42.256
It has been months.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.556
What's happened?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.844
Where did that come from?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.633
You're my wife.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.473
I want to share that with you.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.683
I love you.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.768
I'm very busy.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.730
My back is killing me.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.816
My office at the bank is
having major problems.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.948
Anyway, be quiet.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.248
She'll hear you.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.252
Oh.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.793
You mean your stepdaughter?

20:15.089 --> 20:17.330
Well, maybe she should
hear this so she

20:17.633 --> 20:18.964
doesn't make the same mistake.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.887
You bastard!

20:25.182 --> 20:26.638
I'm out of here.

20:26.934 --> 20:27.934
You bastard!

20:49.331 --> 20:50.331
Where are my pills?

20:53.919 --> 20:54.919
Where are my pills?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.298
I'll get them for you.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.393
I've got your pills.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.728
Here they are.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.028
Thank you.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.575
I don't need these.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.268
I'm not going to
take these anymore.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.824
No more.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.124
No more.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.836
Don't do that.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.843
No.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.395
What were you just then?

23:19.690 --> 23:20.810
You were mumbling something.

23:26.864 --> 23:30.106
I feel like
something's inside me.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.071
You're still not well.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.370
Did you take your meds?

24:17.164 --> 24:21.157
I congratulated you on the
success of your first book

24:21.460 --> 24:23.496
when we first met.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.127
I told you I could
help you then.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.680
You were not making progress
on your second book.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.933
I offered you medication
that would help you.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.889
I'm feeling less stable.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.153
I'm still recovering
from the accident.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.449
I need time.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.038
I understand.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.327
I'll call you when I'm ready.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.502
It will be soon.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.797
Thank you.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.555
Ugh.

26:47.773 --> 26:52.608
Do you care more
about that car than me?

26:52.903 --> 26:56.395
You would rather be drunk
in here than with me?

27:00.369 --> 27:02.951
Right now.

27:03.247 --> 27:07.081
Gives me more pleasure than
you did the past few months.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.376
Screw you!

27:16.093 --> 27:20.553
Amy, why don't you and
Jim come over for dinner?

27:20.848 --> 27:23.715
He could do some company
and love to see you.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.884
We'd love to come over.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.678
We could really use the break.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.643
Great.

27:31.942 --> 27:32.942
See you then.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.161
I'm so glad you could
all come for dinner.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.456
We're glad to visit.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.292
I want you to try this new wine.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.832
I'd love to try your wine.

28:06.268 --> 28:12.059
I still can't believe you're
up and around so fast.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.357
That is amazing.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.486
When you were in the hospital,
you were really bad shape.

28:19.781 --> 28:20.781
Comatose.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.158
Even the doctors didn't think
you were going to make it.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.916
I'm still sore but feeling
much better, thanks.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.669
Dinner will be ready soon.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.080
I'm hungry.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.499
I can't wait for dinner.

28:40.802 --> 28:44.340
It seems like it never happened.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.382
I've had great family genes.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.684
But I'm still in pain.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.771
Can I have some wine please?

29:02.074 --> 29:03.109
How's school?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.694
Almost done.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.612
But I have this really
interesting project

29:09.915 --> 29:12.907
about elephants in Africa.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.496
I'm sure Dylan doesn't want
to hear about that, now.

29:18.674 --> 29:22.337
I want to hear
about her project.

29:22.636 --> 29:23.636
Can I be excused?

29:35.983 --> 29:37.519
I don't feel so well.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.246
I've got so much to do,
I'll never get done.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.999
I'm going to continue hacking
into these government systems

30:04.303 --> 30:06.794
to see what I can find out.

30:07.097 --> 30:09.804
About all this national and
international corruption

30:10.100 --> 30:11.100
I know is going on.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.154
Can we talk now, please?

31:12.788 --> 31:14.619
He stopped taking his meds.

31:19.711 --> 31:20.996
Can you get some for me?

31:31.807 --> 31:34.640
You had confidence.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.927
But now you're
sliding backwards.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.016
Why you keep saying that?

31:40.315 --> 31:41.805
Why?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.109
I know I have issues.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.820
Aren't our sessions
rewarding anymore?

31:49.116 --> 31:50.116
No.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.409
I want to help you.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.825
I can help you.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.535
You know I can.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.793
I don't need any more.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.124
We've gone through the good
times and the bad times

32:05.424 --> 32:06.539
together.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.709
I've given it my all.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.797
I've gone out of my
way to make you happy.

32:12.097 --> 32:16.386
You know I've never intended
it to turn out this way.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.266
I've tried to get off the pills.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.518
I just can't do it.

32:20.814 --> 32:22.554
Your pill-taking for pain relief

32:22.858 --> 32:25.770
has gotten out of control.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.980
I told you this was
going to drive us apart.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.651
I want you to go into rehab.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.990
I need them.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.451
I realize that.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.081
But I'll be lost without them.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.669
I'm sorry for that.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.547
But it's my choice.

32:49.843 --> 32:52.380
It's the wrong choice.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.168
No.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.472
No rehab.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.305
I've got to get this work done.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.063
My job sucks.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.859
I don't like the
people I work with.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.323
I've got to get this work done.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.786
It's going to shock the world.

33:28.089 --> 33:32.082
I've hacked into just about
all the information I need.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.127
They have no idea.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.762
It's going to change
the world as we know it.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.423
It's going to change everything.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.644
They have no idea.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.521
The bank is failing.

33:49.986 --> 33:50.986
Pills help.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.651
I need something stronger.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.111
I need a stronger medication.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.371
It's a crutch.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.827
Get off the pills.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.163
Straighten your life out.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.545
Maybe it's because of you.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.377
What?

34:13.677 --> 34:15.542
I've been so supportive of you.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.303
So supportive.

34:22.601 --> 34:23.601
You heard what I said.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.359
I hate seeing you this way.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.279
You're not the same girl.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.989
I want that girl back.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.870
She's not coming back.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.581
Don't turn away.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
Let's talk!

35:04.644 --> 35:05.644
I'm done talking.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.274
Really?

36:55.463 --> 36:59.422
Even doing the writing
of your first book?

36:59.718 --> 37:02.209
You were doing so well.

37:02.512 --> 37:06.346
You had a peaceful
sense of yourself.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.936
We were given a power.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.848
It's in the wind.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.108
Be careful.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.404
They will harm you.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.283
You know about it?

37:31.166 --> 37:33.782
How do you know?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.996
They want what you have.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.841
I never asked for this.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.299
It was meant for you.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.468
It's yours forever now.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.340
I'm sorry!

38:26.346 --> 38:28.803
I... I let you down.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.775
You didn't let me down.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.107
Let's try and start over.

38:45.406 --> 38:46.406
We both got problems.

38:49.619 --> 38:56.411
I think... I think
I'm beyond that now.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.462
I'm going.

39:03.758 --> 39:07.171
I'm gonna get some fresh air.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.836
Fine!

39:10.139 --> 39:11.139
You go!

39:13.560 --> 39:14.720
Jim: I'm not running away.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.660
It's late.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.820
Come to bed.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.124
You need your sleep.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.956
I'd love to, but I can't.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.667
I have too much to do.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.957
I'm sorry.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.921
I'd love to.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.881
But I need you go away now.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.923
I have too much to do.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.225
I'm sorry.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.352
I am so sorry for
pushing you away.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.668
Are you having an affair?

41:06.589 --> 41:09.547
That's it, isn't it?

41:09.842 --> 41:12.083
You are, aren't you?

41:12.387 --> 41:15.879
No, I'm not having an affair.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.140
Don't be ridiculous.

41:19.435 --> 41:23.269
I'm with you.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.179
I'm just frustrated
with writing.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.690
I haven't told you
the truth though.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.990
I knew it.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.238
There is another girl.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.119
No, that is not true.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.377
I have not been
writing another novel.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.836
I've been hacking
into government

41:53.136 --> 41:58.176
and corporate international
secrets all over the world.

41:58.474 --> 42:02.387
And I'm going to
expose them all.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.427
And no one knows I'm doing it.

42:08.443 --> 42:11.025
No one knows.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.320
What?

42:12.405 --> 42:14.236
Are you crazy?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.443
That's dangerous!

42:16.743 --> 42:17.858
Don't tell anyone.

42:22.623 --> 42:25.205
Don't tell anyone.

43:24.644 --> 43:32.437
Let's invite Jim and family for
a nice quiet, peaceful barbecue

43:32.735 --> 43:35.397
at the pool.

43:35.696 --> 43:36.696
Sounds great.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.445
Awesome.

43:38.741 --> 43:39.741
Call Amy.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.533
Amy?

43:46.833 --> 43:47.833
Af

44:32.795 --> 44:34.581
The doctor at the hospital.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.087
It's nice to see you.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.839
I'd like you to
meet my fiance, Tim.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.341
Very nice to meet you.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.018
The doctor at the hospital.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.051
I'd like you to
meet my fiance, Tim.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.397
I'll go get us a
drink to celebrate.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.830
Excuse me just
one moment, please.

45:27.391 --> 45:28.847
Is this yours?

45:29.143 --> 45:30.383
Yes.

45:30.686 --> 45:35.146
It's just something I've
been carrying for good luck.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.977
Dylan: Oh my god.

45:37.276 --> 45:40.188
Is that you?

45:40.488 --> 45:43.025
It is, isn't it?

45:43.324 --> 45:47.533
It's you, Leah.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.819
It is me.

45:50.122 --> 45:51.532
And you're Dylan.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.448
It's been so long.

45:54.752 --> 45:57.289
I had no idea.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.998
I couldn't see your face.

45:59.298 --> 46:01.539
Gosh, I never thought to look
up the name on the chart.

46:16.524 --> 46:20.733
I can't believe it's you.

46:21.028 --> 46:24.111
I think of you every day.

46:24.407 --> 46:27.069
I think of you every day.

46:27.368 --> 46:29.529
I think of you.

46:29.829 --> 46:30.829
I've never forgotten.

46:44.135 --> 46:48.174
Here's to new and old friends
and finding each other.

46:52.810 --> 46:55.517
I've known her since
she was eight years old.

47:39.398 --> 47:40.854
Well, well.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.983
You're looking
very special today.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.893
Get away from me, Jim.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.357
You're drunk!

47:47.656 --> 47:48.816
And stay there.

47:56.916 --> 47:58.872
Well, it was so
nice to meet you all.

47:59.168 --> 48:00.368
Um, we're going to have to go.

48:00.628 --> 48:01.628
But cheers!

48:05.966 --> 48:06.966
Very nice.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.025
Dylan.

49:41.729 --> 49:43.685
Hey, Emily.

49:43.981 --> 49:44.981
You're home early.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.083
Please stop.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.919
You can't do this.

50:13.219 --> 50:14.339
Please, don't do it anymore.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.353
You're going to stop?

50:28.150 --> 50:29.560
You can't do this anymore.

50:40.162 --> 50:40.742
Hey.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.199
Hey.

50:43.499 --> 50:45.114
Was that ally?

50:45.417 --> 50:47.453
What is she doing in here?

50:47.753 --> 50:48.788
You should know.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.688
You're the one who
invited her over here.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.956
Oh, you can come over
and use our swimming

50:53.259 --> 50:55.716
pool anytime you want.

50:56.011 --> 50:58.002
Remember?

50:58.305 --> 51:01.638
I just found her swimming
topless in our pool.

51:01.934 --> 51:05.847
Then I find her taking a
bubble bath in our tub.

51:06.146 --> 51:10.059
I told her never to come over
again unless she called first.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.724
I'll call her mother.

51:12.027 --> 51:13.027
Good.

51:20.202 --> 51:23.786
I apologize, Emily.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.742
I'll tell her never
to do it again.

51:26.041 --> 51:27.041
Never.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.012
What?

51:39.138 --> 51:41.299
Another hard day at the office?

51:41.599 --> 51:44.341
Damn it, yes, as
a matter of fact.

51:44.643 --> 51:45.678
I'm trying to relax.

51:45.978 --> 51:48.060
Leave me alone.

51:48.355 --> 51:51.392
Have you seen ally?

51:51.692 --> 51:53.523
Let me tell you about ally.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.731
Ally's been sneaking over
to Dylan and Emily's house

51:57.031 --> 51:59.818
and jumping in
their swimming pool.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.152
So?

52:01.452 --> 52:02.572
It's your turn to watch her.

52:06.832 --> 52:07.832
Stay away from me.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.973
I'm gonna shoot this damn
car all full of holes!

53:15.275 --> 53:16.390
No, no, no!

53:22.324 --> 53:23.324
Jim?

53:23.409 --> 53:24.409
Amy?

53:29.039 --> 53:30.904
You killed him.

53:34.837 --> 53:35.417
Dad!

53:35.713 --> 53:36.998
- No, ally.
- Dad!

53:37.297 --> 53:38.297
Don't go in there.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.380
Don't look.

53:40.676 --> 53:41.836
Dad.

53:42.136 --> 53:42.716
Dad.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.876
You didn't see anything.

53:45.180 --> 53:45.669
Dad.

53:45.973 --> 53:48.089
You know how he was.

53:48.392 --> 53:50.007
Dad.

53:50.310 --> 53:58.310
Go call 911.

54:00.362 --> 54:08.362
Go call 911.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.701
He killed himself!

54:15.836 --> 54:18.873
He killed himself!

54:19.173 --> 54:27.173
Call 911.

54:28.056 --> 54:29.262
Jim.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.173
Jim.

54:31.477 --> 54:34.184
Call 911.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.480
Jim.

54:38.066 --> 54:40.682
Jim.

54:40.986 --> 54:42.146
How could you have done this?

54:42.362 --> 54:43.362
Jim!

54:49.161 --> 54:51.618
I can't believe you
committed suicide.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.781
I cannot believe you
committed suicide.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.243
How could you have done this?

54:56.418 --> 54:57.858
How could you have
committed suicide?

55:01.924 --> 55:04.882
I can't help you out
of this one, Jim.

55:05.177 --> 55:09.216
With all we've been through, I
can't pull you out of this one.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.768
Goodbye, my friend.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.064
Goodbye.

55:22.194 --> 55:24.936
I drove him to suicide!

55:25.239 --> 55:26.239
What?

55:28.408 --> 55:29.408
Suicide?

55:36.834 --> 55:38.370
How could Jim have
killed himself?

55:43.715 --> 55:45.000
I can't believe it.

55:45.300 --> 55:46.300
I can't believe it.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.926
It's just not like him.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.712
How could he have
committed suicide?

55:56.728 --> 55:57.728
I'm so drained.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.149
I'm so tired.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.280
I'm exhausted.

56:43.817 --> 56:47.059
Emily, you know
I'm here for you.

56:47.362 --> 56:48.568
I'll support you.

56:48.864 --> 56:53.278
I'll do anything for you,
anything to help you.

56:53.577 --> 56:56.865
Jim's suicide was
not your fault.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.200
You can't blame yourself!

56:59.499 --> 57:00.739
It was not your fault!

57:20.354 --> 57:21.354
I overreacted.

57:23.774 --> 57:28.689
I pushed him at the
barbecue over the edge.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.648
He wasn't a bad person.

57:34.660 --> 57:40.496
It's all my fault.
Coupled with the problems

57:40.791 --> 57:44.909
we have between us at home.

57:45.212 --> 57:46.748
It hurts me to see you this way.

57:50.634 --> 57:51.840
That's not what I wanted.

58:00.394 --> 58:01.554
You're better off without me.

58:07.526 --> 58:08.526
No.

58:11.446 --> 58:13.528
No, don't say that.

58:13.824 --> 58:14.404
Don't say that.

58:14.700 --> 58:17.032
Please don't say that.

58:17.327 --> 58:18.783
I'm not better off without you.

58:22.666 --> 58:23.666
I'm here for you.

58:23.792 --> 58:24.792
I'm here to support you.

58:38.807 --> 58:39.807
Hello?

58:42.853 --> 58:43.433
I'm working.

58:43.729 --> 58:44.729
I'm very busy.

58:48.191 --> 58:49.191
What deadline?

58:51.570 --> 58:54.061
No, I'm not... you know what?

58:54.364 --> 58:56.320
After giving it some
thought, I am not going

58:56.616 --> 58:58.152
to sign the book deal with you.

58:58.452 --> 59:02.115
No, I am not signing
the contract.

59:02.414 --> 59:05.747
I'm under no obligation
to sign with you.

59:06.043 --> 59:07.043
None.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.921
You never gave me a retainer.

59:13.216 --> 59:14.956
I never asked for one.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.673
I am not obliged to sign
any contract with you.

59:18.972 --> 59:20.928
I don't owe you any book.

59:21.224 --> 59:22.224
No book.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.508
That first book made
a fortune for you.

59:27.856 --> 59:29.471
And I don't know owe anything.

59:29.775 --> 59:33.233
In fact, I'm not going to
give you the next book.

59:33.528 --> 59:34.608
That's it.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.520
Don't call here anymore.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.360
No more damn books.

59:39.659 --> 59:40.659
No more books!

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.484
I can't go on like this.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.402
I'm so out of my head.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.788
I can't go on like this.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.131
I think I'm losing my mind.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:01.901
Dylan: I lost my first
real love when I was nine.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.781
She was beautiful.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.077
She was my love.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:10.364
She is still with you.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.667
In your heart.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.666
She knows you're
thinking of her spirit.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:26.839
I've always kept this with
me as a reminder of her.

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.928
But there's so much more.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.896
Tell me about your dream.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.192
Is it her?

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:48.201
We can increase the
dosage if you want to.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:51.158
You do want to?

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.619
You do, don't you?

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.001
No.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:59.459
No, I can.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:06.129
This dream you're
having... what is it?

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:09.844
Are you really writing a book?

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:11.178
Or is it something else?

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:15.814
Tell me.

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:24.355
Our sessions have filled
a void in your life.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.649
Haven't they?

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:27.952
Yes.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.745
Lee: Don't worry.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:36.374
I can help you deal with
the outside pressures.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.285
Oh, by the way.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.921
Are you seeing
another therapist now?

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.582
No, no, no, no.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:45.125
There is no one else.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:48.966
I am not seeing any
other therapists.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.676
There are no other therapists.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.934
How is your, uh,
research coming along?

01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.939
Research?

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.647
What research?

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.937
He isn't writing another novel.

01:03:10.537 --> 01:03:12.698
He's writing about
government secrets.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.029
Is there anything
else you can tell

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.537
me about, uh, Dylan's research?

01:03:55.707 --> 01:03:57.914
It's great to see you.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.209
You too.

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:37.162
L, uh... I broke up with Tim.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.789
The engagement's off.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:43.293
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:45.249
Shh, no.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.755
It's better this way.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:53.887
Besides, there was
someone else anyway.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.182
Ever since I was a kid.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.350
I love you.

01:04:59.646 --> 01:05:04.106
I knew I loved you when
I was eight years old.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.841
I fell in love with
you that day when

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:11.026
we were walking in the forest
and finding the black cube.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:14.361
And I love you.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:15.661
It was magic.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:25.498
It was a true
childhood love story.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.157
You're everything
I've ever wanted.

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:33.060
Dylan: It's a magical day.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.441
It's a magical time.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.443
A place where dreams come true.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.145
I'm sorry, Dylan.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:44.987
Emily!

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.898
Emily!

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.201
Emily!

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:53.915
Emily.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:58.712
Wake up.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:10:59.963
Wake up.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.342
Emily.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:07.763
Emily.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:16.227
It was you.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.728
I know it was you.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.081
I know it was you.

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:11.785
Emily's dead.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:12.545
I've gone in a deeper, much more
profound direction this time.

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.089
Deeper than the first book.

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:16.926
No.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.226
It's not a book.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.354
It's research.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.686
Research that will make a
strong significant difference

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.648
to people all over the country.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:33.360
There should be no
void in your life.

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.524
Keep a clear mind and soul.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:42.661
Don't let the outside
world poison your spirit.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:49.623
It will help you to
write, to inspire you.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:58.056
To give you strength for this
one important act for humanity.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:40.932
All this time, I haven't
been working on my next book.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.513
I've hacked into the
most secret government

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:46.896
and corporate secrets.

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.191
The most secret.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.737
And discovered
corporate and government

01:14:56.033 --> 01:15:02.996
cheating, lying, corruption, and
hypocrisy on a massive level.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.780
Worldwide.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:08.872
Much more than has
ever been seen before.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.913
These documents are going
to change the world.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.628
You're going to
get yourself killed.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.589
Someone's going to find out.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:19.168
They're going to come after you.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:26.136
No one knows but you now.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:32.861
But I think you're right.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.805
Others have found
out what I'm doing.

01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:49.158
I can't wait any longer.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:15:59.460
I'm not ready for this!

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:50.936
No.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:52.232
No.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:55.610
What are you doing?

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:56.859
No, no!

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.360
No!

01:16:58.656 --> 01:16:59.862
No!

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:00.862
No!

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.364
No!

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.820
No!

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.657
Leah, hi, it's Dylan.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.351
I just pulled
underneath the driveway,

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.991
and I'm right at our
front door right now.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:22.465
And your purse is
laying on the walkway.

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:23.377
Leah?

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:24.681
Leah, are you there?

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.807
Yeah, pick up.

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:32.598
Leah, where are you?

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.501
I've gone into the house
and looked for you.

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:36.766
You're not there.

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.629
Your purse is here
laying on the walkway

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:42.446
leading up to front door.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:43.400
Leah, where are you?

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:44.701
Pick up.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.533
Are you ok?

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:47.829
Are you ok, Leah?

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:51.993
Leah, where are you?

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:53.293
I'm worried.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:06.462
I'll find you.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.301
I'll find you, Leah.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:09.090
I'll find you.

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.052
Don't worry.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.352
I'll find you.

01:18:57.775 --> 01:18:58.775
Where is she?

01:18:58.984 --> 01:18:59.473
Who?

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:00.777
Leah!

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.070
I don't know who that is.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.434
Give me the keys to these locks.

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:04.069
I don't have any keys.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:04.854
Give me to the lock.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:05.737
I don't have a key.

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:06.488
I don't know anything.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:07.318
Give me the key!

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:08.618
I don't have...

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.036
Leah.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:14.332
Leah.

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:34.633
No!

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:35.937
No!

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.230
Leah.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.804
It's Dylan.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:40.518
It's Dylan.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.605
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.110
I'm so glad I found you.

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.987
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.363
Don't worry about anything.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:49.772
I'm going to get
you out of here.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.569
Who are these people?

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.279
I don't know who they are.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.240
Let me untie you.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.245
I want to go home.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:56.030
It's ok.

01:19:56.333 --> 01:19:57.333
Let's go home.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.539
Don't worry.

01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.701
I won't let anything
happen to you.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.495
I need you.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.631
You're all I have.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:06.926
It's ok. - They won't...

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:07.625
Trust me. Trust me.

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:08.963
I don't know.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:10.863
We're going to get
out of here right now.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:11.924
Ok.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:15.466
But I need to put
the blindfold back on.

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:16.428
Trust me.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:17.388
Trust me.

01:20:17.688 --> 01:20:19.519
I'm going to do something.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.306
But you can't see.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.129
I'm going to put the
blindfold back on.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:25.393
Trust me.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:26.401
We're going to get out
of here, but you can't

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:27.777
see what's about to happen.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:37.120
I'm going to put
the gag back in.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:39.577
Please be very quiet.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.287
Don't make a noise.

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:46.130
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.425
Let's go.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.381
Leah: What's happening?

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:53.681
I'll tell you later.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.270
Let's go.

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:10.146
You cannot come here again.

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:13.111
But I thought you
liked when I came here.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.695
No, I don't like it.

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:16.485
You've got to go.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.871
Go now.

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:22.408
You cannot come here.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.168
The police are at
my house talking

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:28.080
to my mom about my dad's death.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:33.669
You know he didn't kill myself.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:35.633
She shot him.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.673
She killed him.

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.716
I saw her.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.385
What?

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:48.275
She planted the gun on him to
make it look like a suicide.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.482
You have got to
go to the police.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:52.782
Now!

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.873
Dylan: Thank you for calling.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.307
I'll be back in a minute.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.440
Please leave a message, and
I'll return your calls shortly.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.210
Dylan: Leah, hi, this is Dylan.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:03.234
I just got out of bed.

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.114
I'm sorry.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:07.196
I've got to go out
of town for the day.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:08.781
I'm sorry for not telling you.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:11.367
I had no idea this
was going to happen.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.407
I'll only be gone for a day.

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:16.247
I promise, everything is ok.

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:17.831
Everything is ok.

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:20.167
Do not worry, please.

01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:23.834
I'm sorry I had to sneak
out on you like that.

01:26:24.137 --> 01:26:25.502
I love you, Leah.

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:27.592
I love you, Leah.

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.256
I'll be back soon.

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:30.048
Don't worry.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:31.352
Everything is ok.

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:03.726
Should I be afraid?

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:05.029
Should we be afraid?

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:25.169
Good morning.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.092
What are these?

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:37.504
Where'd they come from?

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.923
A friend of ours left
them for us last night.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.224
I'm worried about him.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:55.647
Nothing's gonna happen to him.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.612
I can't let anything
happen to him.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:15.792
I want to be honest
with all of you.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:18.178
I've been hacking into
government and corporate

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:19.633
systems all over the country.

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.311
All over the world.

01:31:27.524 --> 01:31:29.435
I have discovered
more information

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:32.066
than any hacker ever has.

01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:33.362
Ever.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:38.736
What I have found
will shock you.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:55.416
Here are the files and
supporting documents.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:02.347
And supporting truths.

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:03.722
The factual documents.

01:32:06.771 --> 01:32:10.639
I'm releasing these files
to the public today.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:16.611
Money, payoffs, and
greed were always

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:22.492
the priority of my company,
like many companies.

01:32:26.124 --> 01:32:28.706
I'm afraid of going to prison.

01:32:29.002 --> 01:32:30.367
They now know my crimes.

01:32:38.928 --> 01:32:43.092
I am resigning today
as your senator.

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:46.929
The people who elected me
deserve someone who cares

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:51.016
about them and the country.

01:32:54.235 --> 01:33:00.196
Many of my other fellow
incompetent senators

01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:02.323
must resign now also.

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:10.290
My releasing these
files today will not

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:13.372
endanger any innocent persons.

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:16.708
But they will identify
governments and corporations

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:21.126
that have committed fraudulent
and criminal activities

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.544
against mankind.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:31.311
These people must be punished
and eliminated immediately.

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:35.519
I resign today as
President of the bank.

01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:40.153
For their lying, their
greed, their injustices.

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:46.535
We were all under pressure
to operate in a deceiving way

01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:47.990
and cheat the customer.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:51.792
Goodbye.

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:06.802
Today I am submitting my
resignation as congresswoman.

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:15.100
I and other insurance companies
are about to be indicted

01:34:15.733 --> 01:34:17.644
for crimes we've committed.

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:20.777
The people deserve much better.

01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:28.485
Our crimes are about
to be disclosed.

01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:44.589
Politician 1: Lying, cheating
of our customers, fraud.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:35:01.818
Me and many of my fellow
wall street brokers

01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:05.276
have been lying,
cheating, and scamming

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:06.940
investors out of their money.

01:35:07.243 --> 01:35:10.485
We cannot continue to
let them slip through

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:13.029
our failed justice systems.

01:35:15.835 --> 01:35:20.169
Politician 2: I'm leaving now
rather than going to prison

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:21.465
for the rest of my life.

01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:34.844
These files will prove to
all of you... all of you...

01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:38.855
The political and corporate
dishonesty that exists.

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:49.115
Their systems that are
there to undermine society's

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:56.122
best interests for the
purpose of greed and fraud.

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:12.506
You will be shocked and
amazed at what I have here.

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.141
It will scare you.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:26.481
But you should be scared,
because it is the truth.

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:35.112
You now have all the
truths... the real truth.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:42.127
Act now on your old, outside
of their corporate systems and

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:45.630
these incompetent politicians.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:46.925
Act now.

01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:51.927
It's our only hope
for the future.
