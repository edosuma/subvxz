Hello, I'm JR Cash.

00:09.233 --> 00:12.400
If we don't hear it

we'll go back to the old deal.

00:12.467 --> 00:15.267
But if Eddy is all over

00:15.333 --> 00:17.100

00:17.167 --> 00:18.333
That was Trixie's daddy.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.767

00:21.833 --> 00:23.500

00:23.567 --> 00:25.567
We'll show Joe damn Bihari

how to put it away.

00:58.567 --> 00:59.767
Yeah, if the war had been
a drinking contest,

00:59.833 --> 01:00.900
we'd have lost.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, blue boys.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.533
But we had Prohibition,

13:17.967 --> 13:19.633
Maybe we could hock somethin'.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.767
If we had anything
worth hocking,

13:20.833 --> 13:22.900
we'd have hocked it already.

Hey, I'd be right back.

28:49.267 --> 28:50.967
-Mr. Phillips said so, man.
-Man, well, you know what?

35:08.433 --> 35:09.933
You've had 15 number ones.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.133
I took you from Carney tents
to headlinin' The Ryman.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.233
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be scamming folks

35:14.300 --> 35:16.833
for nickels
to watch ducks dance.

35:16.900 --> 35:20.267
-You gambling again?

35:20.333 --> 35:23.500
You're making money,
I'm making money.

35:23.567 --> 35:27.367
It's a cash business
and a cash business
is built on trust.

35:27.433 --> 35:28.833
"Trust."

35:28.900 --> 35:31.733
Well, what I'm trusting
right now is my gut.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.767
And my gut is telling me

35:34.767 --> 35:36.300
money is hiding
in your pocket.

35:40.167 --> 35:44.500
Receipts, ledgers,
contracts, and IOU's.

35:44.567 --> 35:46.667
And if you're thinking about
firing me, don't bother.

35:46.733 --> 35:48.767
I quit before
I walked through the door.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.567
It's just formality.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.500
Well, so what happened
with Eddy?

36:01.567 --> 36:03.767
Well, Hank Snow happened!

36:03.833 --> 36:06.833
Well, I told Eddy Arnold,
there's no hard feelings,

36:06.900 --> 36:09.100
but it was time
for the Colonel to move on.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.767
Now this is a cash business.

36:11.833 --> 36:14.667
A partnership based on trust

36:14.733 --> 36:17.500
and our mutual desire
to make you a star.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.067
Can I trust you, Hank?

36:21.067 --> 36:22.300
Damn straight.

36:22.367 --> 36:24.133
Okay.

36:31.533 --> 36:32.900
Is your hair getting kinky?

36:32.967 --> 36:34.500

38:50.267 --> 38:51.900
What about the other demos
I sent you?

38:51.967 --> 38:53.500
You produce a Broadway smash,

38:53.567 --> 38:55.300
your next move
ain't dinner theater.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.433
Trust me. Now, I don't wanna
embarrass you
in front the Mrs,

38:57.500 --> 38:59.167

That's what I'm here for.
The money.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.667
That drunk drunk up
every dime you give him.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.100
He ain't nothing without me.

40:23.167 --> 40:26.033
You know it, I know it,
and now

40:26.100 --> 40:28.033
Mr. Joe Bihari knows it, too.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.967
-Bihari?
-Mmm-hmm.

40:30.033 --> 40:31.233
What's he got to do with this?

40:31.300 --> 40:32.800
Plenty.

40:32.867 --> 40:35.833
I cut B.B. King's
Three O'Clock Blues for him.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.833
And it's cookin', too.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.700
Mr. Bihari, knows
what Ike Turner's all about.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.133
I'm a hit record machine.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.633
And you should have got me
when you had the chance.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.500
So what'll it be? Y'all gonna
stay with that drunk
who won't pay you,

40:47.567 --> 40:49.567
or you gonna come with me
and make some real money

40:49.633 --> 40:51.367
with Mr. Bihari and B.B. King?

40:53.633 --> 40:57.833
-All right.
-Your choice fellas,
but I'm following the money.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.367
Fellas, where y'all going?

41:00.267 --> 41:01.333
We got a song to cut.

41:08.167 --> 41:10.567
-Hello.
-I think it's chance,
it's not opportunity.

41:10.633 --> 41:12.533
It's like a work program.
It's like a here...

41:14.067 --> 41:14.700
It's Mr. Phillips. Again.

41:14.767 --> 41:16.100
I'm not here.

41:16.167 --> 41:17.300
He's threatening to drive

41:17.367 --> 41:18.367
to Chicago
if you don't pick up.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.167
Sam, unless you're calling
to tell me you got

41:23.233 --> 41:26.067
the next Delta Cats record,
there's nothing to talk about.

41:26.100 --> 41:30.433
Chess. Why haven't you
returned any of my damn calls?

41:31.267 --> 41:32.600
Or Marion's?

41:32.667 --> 41:34.367
Because you're calling
to tell me I owe you money

41:34.433 --> 41:36.633
and I don't owe you
any damn money.

41:36.700 --> 41:39.700
I gave up Bihari
to work with you.

41:39.767 --> 41:41.133
Yeah, that was a good move,

41:41.200 --> 41:42.833
but Brenston's what we call
a one-hit wonder,

41:42.900 --> 41:44.133
a drunk, and a no-show.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.167
I got promoters calling me
for refunds.

41:46.233 --> 41:48.300
In fact, I got one of my guys
out as Brenston

41:48.367 --> 41:50.900
because no one knows
what the hell he looks anyway.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.367
Well, that solves
your problem,

41:52.433 --> 41:54.667
but it doesn't solve mine.

41:54.733 --> 41:57.667
Sam, you're a nice guy,
but anyone can get lucky once.

41:57.733 --> 41:58.933
It's coming up with
the second one

41:59.067 --> 42:00.933
that separates
the men from the boys.

42:02.367 --> 42:03.500
I gotta go.

42:03.567 --> 42:05.400
All right, Aaron,
I think it's that.

42:05.467 --> 42:06.833
I don't think it's he.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.933
That is what the Blues
are all about, baby.

42:14.500 --> 42:17.500
Hey. Come on,
we'll get through it.

42:17.567 --> 42:20.067
Together. We always do.

42:23.800 --> 42:27.500
Oh... I don't know what I'd do
without you, Marion.

42:30.067 --> 42:31.967

from each other,

42:32.067 --> 42:34.800
I swear I am gonna
stay gone...

42:37.567 --> 42:38.833
I just can't do it.

42:44.367 --> 42:45.367
Phillips.

42:48.167 --> 42:50.367
I don't know
when I'll be home.

42:54.067 --> 42:56.100
Well, dinner'll
have to wait, Becky.

42:58.300 --> 43:01.233

god damn wait!

43:05.100 --> 43:06.167

-Just go on home.

43:08.233 --> 43:09.667

any of it right now.

Not Chess. None of it!
