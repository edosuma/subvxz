>> KRIS: Rob, what's wrong?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.293
Are you confused?

25:28.293 --> 25:28.359
Are you confused?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.394
Tell us.

25:29.394 --> 25:29.460
Tell us.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.596
Talk to us.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.632
>> ROB (crying): I'm sad.

25:34.633 --> 25:34.699
>> ROB (crying): I'm sad.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.801
I don't even want to sit down

25:36.801 --> 25:36.867
I don't even want to sit down

25:36.868 --> 25:39.537
because of how fat I am.

25:39.538 --> 25:39.604
because of how fat I am.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.238
>> KRIS: Oh, Rob.

25:41.239 --> 25:41.305
>> KRIS: Oh, Rob.

We love you.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.378
>> ROB: I don't know...

25:47.379 --> 25:47.445
>> ROB: I don't know...

25:47.445 --> 25:49.079
I just don't know what to do.

25:49.080 --> 25:49.146
I just don't know what to do.

25:49.147 --> 25:50.281
>> KRIS: You're going to be

25:50.282 --> 25:50.348
>> KRIS: You're going to be

25:50.348 --> 25:51.882
just fine.

25:51.883 --> 25:51.949
just fine.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.985
Come in!

25:56.187 --> 25:57.121
Good?

25:57.122 --> 25:57.188
Good?

25:57.188 --> 25:58.222
>> ROB: I'm okay.

25:58.223 --> 25:58.289

or concerns?

26:00.025 --> 26:00.091
or concerns?

26:00.091 --> 26:01.258
>> KRIS: I'm worried about Rob.

26:01.259 --> 26:01.325
>> KRIS: I'm worried about Rob.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.727
I am not going to sit by and

26:02.727 --> 26:02.793
I am not going to sit by and

26:02.794 --> 26:05.563
watch him give up.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.402
>> LEIGH: What do you want to

26:11.403 --> 26:11.469
>> LEIGH: What do you want to

26:11.469 --> 26:12.169
get out of the walk with me?

26:12.170 --> 26:12.236
get out of the walk with me?

26:12.237 --> 26:13.071
>> KOURTNEY: I just feel like

26:13.071 --> 26:13.137
>> KOURTNEY: I just feel like

26:13.138 --> 26:14.072
there's nothing to talk about

26:14.072 --> 26:14.138
there's nothing to talk about

26:14.139 --> 26:14.939
for me.

26:14.940 --> 26:15.006
for me.

26:15.006 --> 26:16.207
>> SCOTT: There's always stuff

26:16.207 --> 26:16.273
>> SCOTT: There's always stuff

26:16.274 --> 26:17.008
to talk about.

26:17.008 --> 26:17.074
to talk about.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.242
I've kind of embraced the whole

26:18.243 --> 26:18.309
I've kind of embraced the whole

26:18.310 --> 26:19.711
"getting to know yourself."

26:19.711 --> 26:19.777
"getting to know yourself."

26:19.778 --> 26:20.912
Kourtney, I don't really think

26:20.912 --> 26:20.978
Kourtney, I don't really think

26:20.979 --> 26:22.046
has come out of her shell much

26:22.047 --> 26:22.113
has come out of her shell much

26:22.113 --> 26:24.248
at all.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.752
>> KIM: We're all sad.

26:27.752 --> 26:27.818
>> KIM: We're all sad.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.387
We all love Lamar so much.

26:29.387 --> 26:29.453
We all love Lamar so much.

26:29.454 --> 26:30.855
I just hate, as your sister,

26:30.855 --> 26:30.921
I just hate, as your sister,

26:30.922 --> 26:32.423
seeing you stuck in this place.

26:32.424 --> 26:32.490
seeing you stuck in this place.

26:32.490 --> 26:33.791
>> KHLOE: That's something I

26:33.792 --> 26:33.858
>> KHLOE: That's something I

26:33.858 --> 26:35.226
thought I'd never have to do.

26:35.226 --> 26:35.292
thought I'd never have to do.

26:35.293 --> 26:36.494
>> KIM: But you don't have to go

26:36.494 --> 26:36.560
>> KIM: But you don't have to go

26:36.561 --> 26:36.994
through it alone.

26:36.995 --> 26:37.061
through it alone.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.030
Like, that's why we're here.

26:43.501 --> 26:45.603
(Scott sighs)

26:48.239 --> 26:50.074
(knocking at door)

26:51.509 --> 26:52.443
>> SCOTT: Hi.

26:52.444 --> 26:52.510

26:56.715 --> 26:57.182
>> SCOTT: You, too.

26:57.182 --> 26:57.248
>> SCOTT: You, too.

26:57.248 --> 26:58.082
Where are we headed?

26:58.083 --> 26:58.149
Where are we headed?

26:58.149 --> 26:59.283
>> LEIGH: We're going to go

26:59.284 --> 26:59.350
>> LEIGH: We're going to go

26:59.351 --> 27:00.185
this way.

27:00.185 --> 27:00.251
this way.

27:00.251 --> 27:01.185
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

27:01.186 --> 27:01.252
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.553
>> SCOTT: Kourt always wants me

27:02.554 --> 27:02.620
>> SCOTT: Kourt always wants me

27:02.621 --> 27:04.089
to be vulnerable and tell her

27:04.089 --> 27:04.155
to be vulnerable and tell her

27:04.155 --> 27:05.823
what's on my mind, but she needs

27:05.824 --> 27:05.890
what's on my mind, but she needs

27:05.890 --> 27:07.191
to open up, too.

27:07.192 --> 27:07.258
to open up, too.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.592
So I set up this one

27:08.593 --> 27:08.659
So I set up this one

27:08.660 --> 27:10.294
walk-and-talk, and I feel like,

27:10.295 --> 27:10.361
walk-and-talk, and I feel like,

27:10.362 --> 27:11.696
you know, it would be good for

27:11.696 --> 27:11.762
you know, it would be good for

27:11.763 --> 27:13.397
us to get some things out there

27:13.398 --> 27:13.464
us to get some things out there

27:13.465 --> 27:14.599
and try to be able to lean on

27:14.599 --> 27:14.665
and try to be able to lean on

27:14.666 --> 27:15.700
each other more.

27:15.700 --> 27:15.766
each other more.

27:15.767 --> 27:16.701
>> LEIGH: I'll open it up for

27:16.701 --> 27:16.767
>> LEIGH: I'll open it up for

27:16.768 --> 27:17.535
you guys.

27:17.535 --> 27:17.601
you guys.

27:17.602 --> 27:18.736
What do you want to get out of

27:18.737 --> 27:18.803
What do you want to get out of

27:18.803 --> 27:19.737
the walk with me?

27:19.738 --> 27:19.804
the walk with me?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.839
>> KOURTNEY: Um...

27:21.840 --> 27:21.906
>> KOURTNEY: Um...

27:21.906 --> 27:23.941
I feel like I don't have

27:23.942 --> 27:24.008
I feel like I don't have

27:24.009 --> 27:25.577
anything, like, major to

27:25.577 --> 27:25.643
anything, like, major to

27:25.644 --> 27:26.811
talk about.

27:26.811 --> 27:26.877
talk about.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.646
>> LEIGH: What about you?

27:28.647 --> 27:28.713
>> LEIGH: What about you?

27:28.713 --> 27:30.114
>> SCOTT: For me, it's tough

27:30.115 --> 27:30.181
>> SCOTT: For me, it's tough

27:30.181 --> 27:31.582
hearing her not say much.

27:31.583 --> 27:31.649
hearing her not say much.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.283
>> KOURTNEY: I just feel like

27:32.283 --> 27:32.349
>> KOURTNEY: I just feel like

27:32.350 --> 27:33.150
there's nothing to talk about

27:33.151 --> 27:33.217
there's nothing to talk about

27:33.218 --> 27:34.085
for me.

27:34.085 --> 27:34.151
for me.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.286

27:35.353 --> 27:36.454
to talk about.

27:36.454 --> 27:36.520
to talk about.

27:36.521 --> 27:37.989
It's really ironic that this

27:37.989 --> 27:38.055
It's really ironic that this

27:38.056 --> 27:39.457
whole trip was Kourtney's idea

27:39.457 --> 27:39.523
whole trip was Kourtney's idea

27:39.524 --> 27:41.292
and I was kind of standoffish

27:41.292 --> 27:41.358
and I was kind of standoffish

27:41.359 --> 27:42.993
about the whole thing, but now

27:42.994 --> 27:43.060
about the whole thing, but now

27:43.061 --> 27:44.195
the tables have turned.

27:44.195 --> 27:44.261
the tables have turned.

27:44.262 --> 27:45.396
I've kind of embraced the whole

27:45.397 --> 27:45.463
I've kind of embraced the whole

27:45.463 --> 27:46.797
"getting to know yourself," and

27:46.798 --> 27:46.864
"getting to know yourself," and

27:46.865 --> 27:47.899
Kourtney, I don't really think

27:47.899 --> 27:47.965
Kourtney, I don't really think

27:47.966 --> 27:49.100
has come out of her shell much

27:49.100 --> 27:49.166
has come out of her shell much

27:49.167 --> 27:50.101
at all.

27:50.101 --> 27:50.167
at all.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.235
>> LEIGH: Is there truth to what

27:51.236 --> 27:51.302
>> LEIGH: Is there truth to what

27:51.302 --> 27:52.202
Scott's saying?

27:52.203 --> 27:52.269
Scott's saying?

27:52.270 --> 27:53.404
That you... you don't open up?

27:53.405 --> 27:53.471
That you... you don't open up?

like that?

27:56.441 --> 27:56.507
like that?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.442
>> KOURTNEY: Pretty much.

27:57.442 --> 27:57.508
>> KOURTNEY: Pretty much.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.643
Even since I was a little girl,

27:58.643 --> 27:58.709
Even since I was a little girl,

27:58.710 --> 27:59.977
I just didn't really talk

27:59.978 --> 28:00.044
I just didn't really talk

28:00.045 --> 28:00.979
that much.

28:00.979 --> 28:01.045
that much.

28:01.046 --> 28:01.980
Like, my mom would say, on

28:01.980 --> 28:02.046
Like, my mom would say, on

28:02.047 --> 28:03.281
Christmas morning, I would come

28:03.281 --> 28:03.347
Christmas morning, I would come

28:03.348 --> 28:04.482
down the stairs and there'd be,

28:04.482 --> 28:04.548
down the stairs and there'd be,

28:04.549 --> 28:06.551
like, everything you could ever

28:06.551 --> 28:06.617
like, everything you could ever

28:06.618 --> 28:07.986
want, and I would just be like,

28:07.986 --> 28:08.052
want, and I would just be like,

28:08.053 --> 28:09.187
"Oh, great."

28:09.187 --> 28:09.253
"Oh, great."

28:09.254 --> 28:10.622
>> LEIGH: So it's kind of your

28:10.622 --> 28:10.688
>> LEIGH: So it's kind of your

28:10.689 --> 28:11.523
personality to be like this.

28:11.523 --> 28:11.589
personality to be like this.

28:11.589 --> 28:12.523
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

28:12.524 --> 28:12.590
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.924
But I feel like, if I really

28:13.925 --> 28:13.991
But I feel like, if I really

28:13.992 --> 28:14.826
have something to say, like,

28:14.826 --> 28:14.892
have something to say, like,

28:14.893 --> 28:15.827
I'll say it.

28:15.827 --> 28:15.893
I'll say it.

28:15.894 --> 28:16.961
I'm not, like, keeping it in

28:16.961 --> 28:17.027
I'm not, like, keeping it in

28:17.028 --> 28:17.928
'cause I don't want to

28:17.929 --> 28:17.995
'cause I don't want to

28:17.996 --> 28:18.930
say something.

28:18.930 --> 28:18.996
say something.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.264
>> LEIGH: What you just said is

28:20.265 --> 28:20.331
>> LEIGH: What you just said is

28:20.331 --> 28:21.465
the biggest takeaway.

28:21.466 --> 28:21.532
the biggest takeaway.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.535
You are not just shy.

28:23.535 --> 28:23.601
You are not just shy.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.569
You haven't just kept it in

28:25.570 --> 28:25.636
You haven't just kept it in

28:25.637 --> 28:27.071
because it's your personality.

28:27.072 --> 28:27.138
because it's your personality.

28:27.138 --> 28:28.472
Somewhere along the way, you

28:28.473 --> 28:28.539
Somewhere along the way, you

28:28.540 --> 28:30.375
learned in your family to just

28:30.375 --> 28:30.441
learned in your family to just

28:30.442 --> 28:33.912
zip it, play it cool.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.416
You might even have a hard time

28:38.416 --> 28:38.482
You might even have a hard time

28:38.483 --> 28:39.817
accessing your feelings 'cause

28:39.818 --> 28:39.884
accessing your feelings 'cause

28:39.884 --> 28:40.751
you don't know what they are

28:40.752 --> 28:40.818
you don't know what they are

28:40.819 --> 28:41.953
because you have shelved them

28:41.953 --> 28:42.019
because you have shelved them

28:42.020 --> 28:43.154
and avoided them for so long.

28:43.154 --> 28:43.220
