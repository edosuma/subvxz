01:50.043 --> 01:51.442
Where are you going?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.276
Help me!

01:53.613 --> 01:54.944
Over here!

02:27.647 --> 02:28.909
Go!

02:29.315 --> 02:30.304
Go!

02:30.984 --> 02:34.511
That was a B-29, bub.
There's no outrunning what's coming.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.553
Yashida!

02:42.662 --> 02:44.152
You're better off down here.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.697
I'd hurry if I were you.

03:53.967 --> 03:54.956
Run. Now!

04:06.379 --> 04:07.937
Stay down!

04:54.560 --> 04:56.755
No, wait! No, no. Wait.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.259
No. It's not safe.

05:04.103 --> 05:08.096
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.275
Where were you?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.309
Nagasaki.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.644
That far back?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.618
You're here.

05:27.794 --> 05:28.886
Of course.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.825
Can you stay?

05:32.098 --> 05:33.588
You know I can't.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.758
Jean, I'm so sorry.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.159
I know.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.967
I'll never hurt you or anyone
ever again.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.438
I made a vow.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.006
A solemn vow?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.337
You're making fun of me.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.444
It's too late.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.582
No! No, Jean!

06:00.760 --> 06:02.159
No, no, no! Please!

06:02.295 --> 06:03.421
You can't hide.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.585
No, no, no! Please!

06:04.764 --> 06:05.924
You can't hide!

06:06.099 --> 06:07.623
No, Jean! No!

06:08.334 --> 06:09.323
No.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.417
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.458
- Got the arrows?
- Yeah.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.121
Remember the arrows?

08:17.296 --> 08:20.094
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

08:25.571 --> 08:26.560
Yeah!

08:30.843 --> 08:32.470
What are you doing?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.169
Man, you almost blew his foot off!

08:34.580 --> 08:36.275
You're not a hunter, are you?

08:37.416 --> 08:38.905
Not anymore.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.311
What the hell?

09:57.163 --> 09:58.755
Don't make me do this.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.905
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

10:45.077 --> 10:48.513
We didn't hear nothing except twigs.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.279
Then it just came upon us.

10:51.250 --> 10:55.448
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

10:56.322 --> 11:00.088
Ripped through the tent,
knocked over the snowcat like it was a toy.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.985
You the one was attacked by the grizzly?

11:05.631 --> 11:07.826
I'm the one that survived.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.636
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.438
What's your name, mister?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.151
It's Logan.

11:33.993 --> 11:38.521
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.673
Go ahead, ask me where I found it.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.616
Ask me.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.384
Where did you find it?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.526
Well, funny you should ask.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.854
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

12:10.563 --> 12:15.023
Whoever shot it, didn't have the wind or
the balls to track the animal properly...

12:15.201 --> 12:17.066
and put it out of its misery.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.570
Instead of dropping
a lethal dose of the poison...

12:22.742 --> 12:26.644
it bled into the bear,
made him crazy, killed five people.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.473
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.342
Because I don't dip my arrows
in anything.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.583
In that case,
you got nothing to worry about.

12:39.658 --> 12:40.647
Damn.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.327
That hurt.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.226
Sorry, Jean.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.704
I wouldn't bother with them.

12:56.876 --> 13:00.004
Most of them will die soon anyway,
without your help.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.049
Three of them, a week from now
in the same truck.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.694
This sword is hundreds of years old...

13:24.870 --> 13:28.237
<i>and was named Danzan
by the first samurai who used it.</i>

13:28.407 --> 13:31.240
<i>Danzan means "separator" in Japanese.</i>

13:32.645 --> 13:37.480
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.253
Like so.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.626
I'm parked in back.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.776
Get in.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.785
Sorry, it's a rental.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.691
Who are you?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.524
Me? I'm Yukio.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.131
And?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.827
I've been trying to find you
for over a year.

14:30.402 --> 14:31.562
Why?

14:31.737 --> 14:33.705
To give you that.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.169
My employer wanted you to have it.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.174
Who's your employer?

14:39.812 --> 14:41.404
Master Yashida.

14:55.694 --> 15:00.495
He said it belongs to you,
and that he's paying all debts.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.157
Master Yashida is dying.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.164
He wants to say thank you
for saving his life all those years ago.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.769
He knows that you are a...

15:10.876 --> 15:12.002
busy man.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.669
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.742
All right, where is he?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.179
Tokyo.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.444
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.111
It would be dishonorable
for you to refuse his request.

15:24.290 --> 15:28.351
Apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.051
All right? I've got things to do.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.590
Do not apologize.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.255
It's been an honor
just to meet the Wolverine.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.803
That's not who I am anymore,
you understand?

15:41.707 --> 15:42.799
Interesting.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.734
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

15:46.912 --> 15:47.901
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.309
- No!
- I think you know.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.209
Pull over.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.474
You are a soldier.

15:51.650 --> 15:52.878
No, I'm not. Pull over.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.885
- You are a soldier.
- Pull over, now!

15:56.155 --> 15:57.383
Now.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.821
You are a soldier,
and you seek what all soldiers do.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.122
And what's that?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.801
An honorable death.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.197
An end to your pain.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.468
Who says I'm in pain?

16:15.708 --> 16:19.804
A man who has nightmares
every night of his life is in pain.

16:37.529 --> 16:38.723
One day.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.898
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.730
Okay.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.671
Fifteen hours. Depending on the wind.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.904
Fifteen hours?

16:58.150 --> 16:59.412
You don't like to fly?

16:59.985 --> 17:01.475
I love it.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.066
We are almost there.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.002
So, you can see the future?

17:29.081 --> 17:31.015
I can read a map.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.743
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.582
I know they are going to die.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.617
We are all going to die.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.260
You said they would die in the same truck,
in a week.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.956
If you're right, that's quite a talent.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.302
We don't all have claws.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.301
So, do I die on this plane?

17:59.812 --> 18:00.972
No.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.411
Not on this plane.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.781
Master Yashida is not well tonight.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.294
A lot of guns.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.957
There have been attacks.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.866
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

19:00.038 --> 19:01.369
By who?

19:01.540 --> 19:04.065
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

19:04.243 --> 19:07.337
They've grown strong
as the government has grown weak.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.173
Hip replacement.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.437
Hey.

19:41.780 --> 19:42.838
This way.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.282
Who's that?

19:48.987 --> 19:51.353
Shingen, Master Yashida's son.

19:54.993 --> 19:55.982
He's good.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.490
He's all right.

20:04.436 --> 20:07.166
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

20:07.339 --> 20:09.500
Master Yashida is traditional.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.644
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.658
That's Mariko, his granddaughter.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.043
Mariko.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.018
What's wrong with you?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.728
You haven't answered my emails.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.021
I can't tell you now.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.725
Yes, you can.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.205
Who is the caveman?

21:17.876 --> 21:20.470
The man Grandfather wanted me to find.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.841
You can't bring him in like that.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.527
Shizu and Saki
are going to disinfect you.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.419
Give you a shave.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.088
Like hell they are.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.090
Get in the tub.

21:43.702 --> 21:44.726
Whoa.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.996
Get in the tub.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.067
Really?

21:52.778 --> 21:54.075
All right.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.517
Okay. Okay.

22:00.686 --> 22:03.322
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.193
What?

22:17.269 --> 22:18.463
What?

22:19.204 --> 22:20.637
You look nice.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.274
I feel violated.

22:24.242 --> 22:27.075
Prepare two more suppressors
for Master Yashida.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.141
And check his blood pressure.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.391
<i>Yashida-sama.</i>

22:55.941 --> 22:56.965
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

22:57.476 --> 22:59.410
You look the same.

23:00.245 --> 23:01.906
But, then, that is no surprise.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.709
Dr. Green.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.377
Leave us, please.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.919
Five minutes, no more.

23:15.494 --> 23:16.893
My oncologist.

23:17.662 --> 23:18.720
Well done.

23:38.483 --> 23:41.919
The painting is from the village
of my birth.

23:42.421 --> 23:46.653
It depicts the bravery and skill
of the Black Clan.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.260
Ninja warriors.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.488
They served my family
for seven centuries.

23:54.199 --> 23:57.828
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.469
I wanted to repay you.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.177
To offer you something no one else can.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.446
A gift to equal the life you gave to me.

24:11.883 --> 24:13.350
I don't need anything.

24:13.518 --> 24:14.951
Not a thing.

24:15.687 --> 24:18.349
Eternity can be a curse.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.222
It hasn't been easy for you,
living without time.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.152
The losses you have had to suffer.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.565
A man can run out of things to live for.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.959
Lose his purpose.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.865
Become a ronin.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.366
A samurai without a master.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.514
I can end your eternity.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.578
Make you mortal.

24:49.387 --> 24:54.552
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.695
Yashida Industries can do anything.

24:58.330 --> 25:02.858
We have reason to believe
your ability to heal can be passed.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.023
Passed?

25:04.202 --> 25:05.726
From you to another.

25:09.241 --> 25:12.335
You have struggled long enough, Logan.

25:13.845 --> 25:14.937
I'm confused.

25:15.113 --> 25:18.742
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.612
I am the same man.

25:20.785 --> 25:23.276
I was not ready to die then.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.946
I am not ready to die now.

25:26.758 --> 25:27.952
But you are...

25:29.194 --> 25:30.957
aren't you?

25:33.031 --> 25:34.464
Are you offering to kill me?

25:34.633 --> 25:35.224
No.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.264
Not right away.

25:37.969 --> 25:41.097
You can live a long and ordinary life.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.300
Fall in love, have a family...

25:44.476 --> 25:46.376
grow old.

25:47.445 --> 25:51.779
And one day, die an ordinary death.

25:56.087 --> 25:57.554
It can be done.

25:58.957 --> 26:03.121
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.321
<i>Please, Logan-san.
I need you again.</i>

26:06.498 --> 26:08.932
I fear for my family.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.568
I fear for everything I have built.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.897
<i>- Enough. You should leave.
- Please, Logan-san.</i>

26:14.072 --> 26:15.505
They're going to kill her.

26:15.674 --> 26:16.333
Who?

26:16.508 --> 26:18.601
Mariko, my granddaughter.

26:19.177 --> 26:22.806
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.779
You don't want what I've got.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.749
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

26:32.123 --> 26:33.351
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

26:33.792 --> 26:34.986
He needs a sedative.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.296
Breathe slowly and calm yourself.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.636
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

27:26.878 --> 27:27.970
Let go.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.906
You about done?

27:33.218 --> 27:35.345
Let go of me.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.936
He just wanted to say goodbye, huh?

28:05.717 --> 28:07.014
You two grew up together.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.914
Yes.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.184
But you're not her sister.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.682
No.

28:16.561 --> 28:19.189
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

28:20.065 --> 28:23.091
He brought Mariko to see a factory
he was building.

28:26.304 --> 28:29.637
I was digging through the garbage
for something to eat.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.270
So they just took you home with them?

28:34.646 --> 28:37.979
It was always difficult for Mariko
to make friends.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.757
I'll see to it
the plane is ready in the morning.

28:50.328 --> 28:52.159
Sleep here.

28:59.437 --> 29:02.406
<i>Eternity can be a curse...</i>

29:03.308 --> 29:04.570
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:08.110
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

29:08.313 --> 29:09.337
How old are you?

29:09.981 --> 29:11.448
Interesting offer.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.948
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

29:18.656 --> 29:21.181
I thought you wanted to be with me.

29:21.659 --> 29:22.683
Come here.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.433
He's dead.

30:17.682 --> 30:19.809
I didn't foresee it.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.271
Who's that? With Mariko.

31:58.449 --> 31:59.939
His name is Noburo Mori.

32:00.118 --> 32:02.678
Minister of Justice, a rising star.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.414
He's Mariko's fiancé.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.581
You need to bow.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.057
Bow.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.602
Lord Shingen, this is Mr. Logan.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.638
I know who he is.

32:24.208 --> 32:25.937
Your father was a good man.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.744
He would often say the same about you.

32:31.115 --> 32:34.607
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

32:36.421 --> 32:40.881
Tell me, why do you think
he sent our little Yukio to fetch you?

32:42.894 --> 32:44.327
To say goodbye.

32:45.997 --> 32:48.158
And now you have.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.391
Time for you to go back to your cave.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.517
Anyone else you want me to meet?

33:29.007 --> 33:30.838
I pledge to you...

33:31.476 --> 33:32.943
Master Yashida...

33:34.212 --> 33:36.112
to be vigilant...

33:36.447 --> 33:38.210
and to dedicate my life...

33:38.449 --> 33:40.383
to protect Mariko.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.621
<i>That armor
belonged to Shiruba-Samurai...</i>

33:48.793 --> 33:51.091
the Silver Samurai.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.663
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.005
Logan?

34:18.755 --> 34:20.656
Hey. Something's not right.

34:22.427 --> 34:23.893
Let go.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.079
Logan!

34:54.625 --> 34:56.388
Logan!

35:23.254 --> 35:23.913
Logan!

37:04.422 --> 37:05.582
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

37:07.692 --> 37:09.182
Let's go. Come on, let's go!

37:22.640 --> 37:23.470
Yukio!

37:23.641 --> 37:24.608
Mariko!

38:10.721 --> 38:12.245
Mariko!

39:04.075 --> 39:05.599
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.027
Here, here! Here!

39:45.249 --> 39:46.409
Move!

39:47.251 --> 39:49.378
In here!
Move!

40:05.336 --> 40:06.667
Keep moving, keep moving.

40:07.304 --> 40:08.931
Move!

40:17.982 --> 40:19.609
You're bleeding. You need help.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.274
Just keep moving.

40:30.461 --> 40:32.326
Thank you for what you did back there.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.054
- Those were Yakuza.
- I'm fine.

40:34.231 --> 40:35.892
Why are they after you?

40:36.066 --> 40:38.591
I'm fine. I can make my way from here.

40:38.769 --> 40:42.398
You should go. Get yourself a doctor.

41:34.191 --> 41:35.180
That's nice.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.754
This is one of those bullet trains, right?

41:39.930 --> 41:41.761
I told you I don't need your help.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.126
So what do they do, like,
300 miles an hour?

41:55.312 --> 41:57.109
This cowardly attack was...

41:57.481 --> 41:59.210
the work of Yakuza thugs.

41:59.617 --> 42:03.519
A violent response to my efforts...

42:03.721 --> 42:06.884
to crack down on organized crime.

42:09.226 --> 42:11.854
They exited the North Gate.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.960
She was with the stranger...

42:21.805 --> 42:24.069
<i>Your gaijin friend, where is he?</i>

42:24.575 --> 42:26.736
Last I saw,
he was protecting your daughter.

42:29.079 --> 42:30.842
You are a toy doll.

42:31.015 --> 42:34.143
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.513
Keep that in mind.

42:48.599 --> 42:51.033
So, where are we headed, Mariko?

42:55.606 --> 42:56.698
Where are we going?

42:58.309 --> 43:03.076
I'm going to the end of the line.
My family has a home in the South.

43:03.614 --> 43:04.876
That's stupid.

43:05.616 --> 43:08.483
No offense, but they're gonna know
to look for you there.

43:08.819 --> 43:10.616
Not this place.

43:11.622 --> 43:12.983
- You want to be left alone.
- Yes.

43:13.123 --> 43:14.090
- I understand.
- Do you?

43:14.291 --> 43:15.781
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.052
Problem is, if I do that...

43:17.227 --> 43:19.508
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

43:22.900 --> 43:26.666
You can't pretend shit isn't happening
when it is, princess.

43:26.837 --> 43:30.568
Unless you want to die. In that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

43:54.698 --> 43:56.359
What the hell?

44:17.287 --> 44:19.156
What the hell is happening?

47:03.787 --> 47:04.776
What happened to you?

47:04.955 --> 47:06.824
We get off here. Let's go.

47:07.224 --> 47:09.584
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find someplace safe.

47:09.626 --> 47:12.390
I don't understand.
How do you know they were Yakuza?

47:12.563 --> 47:14.164
They were the same guys from the temple.

47:14.464 --> 47:15.522
How do you know they were after me?

47:15.699 --> 47:17.894
Look, we need to find someplace safe.
We need to get off the streets.

47:18.068 --> 47:19.968
- I don't understand.
- Shut up! Listen.

47:20.137 --> 47:22.537
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

47:22.706 --> 47:24.264
Straight ahead.

47:33.784 --> 47:35.775
So, where's the nice part of town?

47:35.953 --> 47:37.215
Another eight blocks that way.

47:37.387 --> 47:39.446
Good. We're staying here.

47:39.823 --> 47:41.415
Let's go.

47:46.330 --> 47:48.423
This is a love hotel.

47:48.599 --> 47:49.964
A what?

47:50.133 --> 47:51.657
A love hotel.

47:52.903 --> 47:55.599
For couples, understand?

47:56.673 --> 47:58.140
Right.

47:58.909 --> 48:00.103
Hey.

48:00.277 --> 48:04.441
Two rooms.
Adjoining rooms, on the same floor.

48:04.681 --> 48:06.979
Right next to each other. Very close.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.518
Same floor. Same floor.

48:28.605 --> 48:29.765
What did she say?

48:30.674 --> 48:33.802
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

48:33.977 --> 48:38.880
She's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office... "

48:39.683 --> 48:42.345
or the "mission to Mars. "

48:58.402 --> 48:59.869
This'll do.

49:03.907 --> 49:06.068
<i>Liftoff! We have a liftoff!</i>

49:06.243 --> 49:08.404
Kind of homey, actually.

49:15.752 --> 49:17.413
Where do you plan on sleeping?

49:20.190 --> 49:21.020
I don't.

49:45.949 --> 49:47.439
That's a lot of blood.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.055
I thought you were done being the hero.

49:53.690 --> 49:56.682
But these guys were... trying to kill her.

49:59.429 --> 50:01.454
Just let it go.

50:02.933 --> 50:04.594
It's not hard to die.

50:07.404 --> 50:09.235
Come to me.

51:13.937 --> 51:18.533
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.266
Is he a doctor?

51:20.777 --> 51:23.109
In a manner of speaking, yes.

51:23.513 --> 51:25.640
He's a veterinarian...

51:26.650 --> 51:28.447
student.

51:29.052 --> 51:30.679
Large animal.

51:35.292 --> 51:36.156
Thanks.

51:40.230 --> 51:44.326
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

51:44.501 --> 51:47.527
Okay, okay, okay.

51:56.813 --> 51:57.472
Hey.

51:59.716 --> 52:01.343
Thank you.

52:06.523 --> 52:08.753
I never needed this before.

52:08.925 --> 52:11.257
What? Help?

52:16.266 --> 52:20.066
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

52:20.237 --> 52:21.226
Who is she?

52:21.404 --> 52:24.931
He met her last year
when he was in America for treatment.

52:25.742 --> 52:30.008
Your grandfather told me my healing
could be taken from me, passed on.

52:31.848 --> 52:34.316
I'm not getting better, not like before.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.446
She did this to me.

52:48.765 --> 52:49.754
Blondie!

52:51.001 --> 52:51.990
Blondie!

52:56.740 --> 52:59.800
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

53:20.030 --> 53:23.261
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.993
So you haven't found them?

53:28.805 --> 53:31.205
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

53:31.374 --> 53:35.208
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

53:35.378 --> 53:39.314
I can slit your pretty mouth open, before
you open it to say one more stupid...

53:43.653 --> 53:46.520
I asked you to do one thing, little man.

53:46.890 --> 53:48.482
Bring me the mutant.

53:48.658 --> 53:51.525
I don't work for you.
I work for the House of...

53:53.830 --> 53:56.560
You work for Yashida, I get it.

53:58.368 --> 54:01.462
Yet you cannot fulfill his dying wish.

54:02.172 --> 54:05.539
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

54:05.709 --> 54:08.974
Where is Logan?
I am not done with him.

54:14.818 --> 54:16.752
The mutant has powers.

54:18.221 --> 54:22.021
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

54:22.492 --> 54:23.891
I did that.

54:24.060 --> 54:26.688
I suppressed his power so he
could be taken.

54:26.930 --> 54:30.093
You see, it's me you should respect.

54:33.536 --> 54:37.307
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.826
We get off here.

55:25.955 --> 55:27.752
Where are we?

55:28.692 --> 55:30.489
Just outside Nagasaki.

55:39.636 --> 55:41.035
This way.

55:59.289 --> 56:01.655
This is the guy from the
funeral, the archer.

56:03.126 --> 56:04.957
He was your boyfriend.

56:05.128 --> 56:07.221
That's Harada.

56:08.565 --> 56:10.396
We were village champions that summer.

56:11.468 --> 56:15.461
He with the bow and me with the knives.

56:21.177 --> 56:23.668
Harada and I were planning to get married.

56:23.847 --> 56:25.439
What stopped you?

56:25.615 --> 56:26.877
Grandfather.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.712
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

56:37.260 --> 56:40.229
From the mountain, from the sea.

56:52.242 --> 56:55.075
Chopsticks upright are a bad omen.

56:56.045 --> 56:58.104
It resembles incense at a funeral.

57:01.651 --> 57:04.085
Nothing is without meaning.

57:05.555 --> 57:09.651
So, the other night at the house,
when you ran out in the rain...

57:09.826 --> 57:11.987
what did that mean?

57:13.596 --> 57:15.723
My grandfather was dying.

57:16.599 --> 57:19.568
You knew he was gonna die.
He'd been sick for a long time.

57:19.736 --> 57:22.227
It wasn't his death I feared.

57:22.839 --> 57:24.670
So, what, then?

57:26.943 --> 57:28.843
What did he tell you that night?

57:32.348 --> 57:34.748
Mariko, why did your father hit you?

57:35.819 --> 57:37.343
I was trying to warn him.

57:37.520 --> 57:39.147
About what?

57:40.657 --> 57:42.989
What did your grandfather tell you?

57:45.094 --> 57:48.291
He told me that...

57:49.966 --> 57:54.869
in three days,
when they read his will...

57:57.207 --> 58:01.507
I will become
the most powerful person in Japan.

58:04.380 --> 58:06.109
He gave it all to me.

58:07.784 --> 58:08.944
The company?

58:13.189 --> 58:15.180
I didn't want it.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.352
He knew that.

58:20.563 --> 58:23.293
I don't understand why he gave it to me.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.064
It was all my father dreamed of.

58:27.203 --> 58:29.068
Well, that's why.

58:33.309 --> 58:35.709
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

58:36.646 --> 58:37.874
Noburo.

58:38.047 --> 58:39.674
Does he know about this?

58:39.849 --> 58:41.180
No.

58:42.585 --> 58:44.348
Why are you marrying him?

58:44.754 --> 58:46.813
He seems like kind of an asshole.

58:48.691 --> 58:51.023
My father arranged it last year.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.552
What?

58:52.729 --> 58:55.926
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

58:59.402 --> 59:02.667
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.978
I don't expect you to understand.

59:12.682 --> 59:15.014
You're not Japanese.

59:21.324 --> 59:25.226
Our island is long and thin.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.787
Trains only run in two directions.

59:28.498 --> 59:29.897
I assure you Lord Shingen...

59:30.099 --> 59:31.930
my officers are making every effort...

59:32.135 --> 59:33.966
Then they're idiots.

59:34.170 --> 59:36.104
You've wasted enough of my time.

59:36.973 --> 59:38.998
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

59:41.744 --> 59:43.109
Get out and find her!

59:48.885 --> 59:52.082
Tell me you have more promising news
from your contacts.

59:52.855 --> 59:54.823
They open the will in three days.

59:55.325 --> 59:57.088
We are running out of time.

59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.555
Soon, I hope.

01:00:01.197 --> 01:00:02.892
I'm sending men to the South.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.091
That's where we found the bodies.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:17.910
If the Yakuza got into the funeral...

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.543
they had someone inside.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.213
They'll never find me here.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.048
You're not safe.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.889
I'm coming down there.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.482
They'll follow you.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.086
Please.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.751
Wait a few days.

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.257
Please. I'm fine.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:37.163
Logan's here.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.401
He's wounded, Mariko.

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.271
Someone's here.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.099
Mariko?

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.070
I have to go.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.400
Mariko?

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.339
A tree fell on the road.

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:54.614
The men could use some help.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.543
Are you okay?

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.286
Tired.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.551
Do you need something?

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.749
No.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:48.963
This will help.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.284
It's time.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.150
What?

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.892
Please. Take it.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.958
Thank you.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.651
No.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.814
Two hands.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:20.125
Japanese sword require two hands.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:25.663
Like that?

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:27.063
That's it.

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.673
It's beautiful, Yashida.

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.805
But I can't take it.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.574
Please.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:39.978
Thank you.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:47.549
Keep it safe.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.358
Keep it safe for me.

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:57.491
Someday, I'll come get it.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.005
It's time.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:57.318
I was here when it happened.

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.229
It's how I met your grandfather.

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.657
We hid in there.

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.736
I heard the stories.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:14.000
My grandfather would say...

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:17.339
what happened here was proof
that everything in the world finds peace.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.075
Eventually.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.892
That man can recover from anything.

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:37.455
Maybe you, too.

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.567
You don't sleep very well.

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:47.709
You call out in the night.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:55.614
Who's Jean?

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.329
We should go back. There's rain coming.

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.339
This isn't right.

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:18.228
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.399
Your grandfather called me a ronin.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.173
A samurai without a master.

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:33.209
He said
I was destined to live forever...

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.750
with no reason to live.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.248
Was he right?

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:45.824
Yes.

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.728
Still?

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:42.906
Hey.

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.443
What are you doing?

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.550
This isn't going to end well.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.923
Everyone you love dies.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.613
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.386
Do you know what that means?

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.930
An animal.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.334
A fierce creature
with long claws and sharp teeth.

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:41.466
It fears nothing.

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:47.305
When I was a girl, I had nightmares.

01:09:47.983 --> 01:09:50.349
I'd wake up and run to my parents.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.015
My father would get angry.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.520
"Go back to sleep. Face your fears. "

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:05.489
My grandfather was different.

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:10.201
<i>He told me stories about Kuzuri,
his friend.</i>

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.166
Who he met at the bottom of a well.

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:20.772
<i>He said the Kuzuri was magical
and saved his life.</i>

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:28.454
<i>He said Kuzuri would protect me, too,
as I slept in my bed.</i>

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.224
Who's Jean?

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.399
Is she like you?

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.137
What happened to her?

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.381
She died.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.855
I killed her.

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.433
<i>Along with the Kuzuri.</i>

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.139
Logan.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.392
Mariko?

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.728
Logan!

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:17.929
Logan!

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.593
Mariko?

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.464
Mariko!

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:25.172
No! Logan!

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.106
No!

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.012
Logan!

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.674
No!

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:48.525
Mariko!

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:53.290
Logan!

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:56.063
No!

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.407
Logan!

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:02.272
Mariko! Mariko!

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:03.911
Logan!

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:25.594
Where are they taking her?

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.495
Where are they taking her?

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.136
Where, you piece of shit?

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:33.599
<i>I no talk, gaijin.</i>

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.176
I never talk.

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:44.778
Who hired you?

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.698
Uh-oh.

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:09.637
Take me to Noburo.

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.309
- Logan...
- Take me to him.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.476
I need to tell you something.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:16.584
Do it. Now.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.771
You wait in the car.

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:40.264
- Logan.
- What?

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.043
I saw you die.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.679
What?

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:46.943
I saw you die.

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.373
When? Just now?

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.513
A while ago.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.587
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:56.986
More like looking through a keyhole.

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.824
But I'm always right.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.063
All I can see
is one part of a person's life...

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.225
their death.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:10.166
And I saw yours.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.276
So, what did you see?

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:20.078
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.110
You're holding your own heart
in your hand.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.180
It's not beating.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.305
I don't have time for this shit.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:35.461
When I was five,
I knew how my own parents would die.

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:41.291
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.433
Look at me.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:51.274
A lot of people have tried to kill me,
and I'm still here.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.374
Yeah...

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.040
but you're different now, aren't you?

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.718
They can hurt you.

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.878
They can kill you.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.047
Just wait in the car.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:14.862
I said, wait in the car.

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:15.892
You need backup.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:17.971
You're not safe, not in your condition.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:22.274
Just think of me as your bodyguard.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.083
Sexy.

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:40.924
Come on!

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.085
I'm coming.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:53.598
Okay, round four. Here we go.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.188
Drink for you, my lady.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.256
Get out.

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:24.600
Not you.

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:27.702
Call me old-fashioned...

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:30.836
but I thought being engaged meant
you were done with this kind of bullshit.

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:33.609
I am the Minister of Justice. Do you
have any idea what I could do to you?

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:37.548
Really? You're gonna try and talk tough,
standing there in your red underwear?

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.180
You have ten words...

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.618
ten words...

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:46.159
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:49.161
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:53.199
If I don't like what you say,
you are going through that window.

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:55.461
You don't have the faintest idea
what's going on...

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.366
How many words was that?

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:00.200
Nine.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.969
Nine. You have one word left.

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:06.742
Really?

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.207
Shingen. Shingen!

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.414
Keep going.

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:16.888
Since he got sick...

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:20.551
old man Yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:23.493
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North...

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:26.031
secretly trying to prolong his life.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.329
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.665
He was obsessed with you.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.539
English!

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:39.070
Shingen lied, protected the old man...

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:42.444
concealed the debt
from stockholders and the board.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:45.017
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.214
And then the old man
left everything to his granddaughter.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.950
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.058
It's true.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:55.287
Mariko would have never
gone through with the wedding...

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:57.955
not once the will was revealed.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.860
She never took to me.

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:03.100
Oh, really? A class act like you.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:06.433
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:11.204
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:14.305
Political careers don't last forever.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:15.981
That's right.

01:19:16.284 --> 01:19:18.115
Wait! Wait! No!

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:21.050
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.753
I didn't like it.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.757
Wow.

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:29.062
How did you know
there's a pool down there?

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:30.596
I didn't.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:51.248
Did you know I studied biology in college?

01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:54.654
Genetics.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.094
There are genes that skip generations.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.393
Recessive genes.

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:06.934
Eyes.

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.129
Eyes. Hair.

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:10.732
Talent.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.605
Temperament.

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:18.974
Not every child gets the same.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.908
My father saw little of himself in me.

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:24.608
But in you...

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.352
he faced a mirror.

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:48.409
How did you convince my father...

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.042
to award you control...

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.711
of Asia's largest corporation?

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:53.647
You've gone insane.

01:20:55.183 --> 01:20:56.980
I'm just waking up.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.210
If you kill me, you will lose...

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.319
what little honor you have left.

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.287
Fear not Mariko.

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:09.893
I don't want to hurt you.

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:11.458
I want to help you.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.327
Help you end your pain...

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:14.808
what that mutant stopped you...

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:16.231
from doing last week.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.665
I never wanted to die, Father.

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.486
It's alright, Mariko.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.425
Come with me.

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:44.394
What is happening?!

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.893
More than you can imagine.

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.839
You.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:58.712
Me.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.611
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need your daughter alive.

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:04.115
What are you?

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:07.353
A chemist, a nihilist...

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:11.225
a capitalist, a mutation.

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:16.319
A viper.

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.392
Where is the security?

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:51.521
Shingen?

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.579
Logan.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.753
This. This here.

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.558
Where is this?

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:29.770
Master Yashida's birthplace.

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:33.603
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:38.607
How far?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.874
500 kilometers from here.

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:51.081
I gotta get that thing out of me.

01:24:51.619 --> 01:24:52.551
How?

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.080
No, stop, Logan.

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:57.247
I saw you die. I'm never wrong.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.483
I'm never wrong.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.620
You're not always right.

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.821
You didn't know
the old man was gonna bite it.

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.895
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:04.944
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:08.498
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.831
- You're going to die, Logan.
- Maybe that's okay.

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:13.637
No, listen to me, Logan!

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.799
No, stop. Logan!

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.310
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.948
No! Listen to me! Please, no!

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:24.174
No, stop. Listen to me.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:26.478
Logan!

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:36.321
Move!

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:37.988
Stay away from him.

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:41.164
He killed your master.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:44.533
Put hands on your sister.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.671
And now you want him?

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.241
Oh, no. I can't see.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.081
You'll always be a beggar.

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.181
You're crazy.

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:04.549
Oh, no.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.019
Yukio.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:57.602
Logan!

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:06.914
Logan! Logan!

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:08.881
Logan!

01:27:45.793 --> 01:27:47.784
Don't hit my friends.

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:51.957
Where's Mariko?

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:54.931
She's gone. That Viper bitch took her.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:57.469
It was my father's obsession...

01:27:58.172 --> 01:28:00.936
with mutation, with God's mistakes...

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:06.641
like you and her,
that ruined this house.

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:19.880
You tried to kill your daughter.

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:24.024
Live with that.

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:42.005
What kind of monster are you?

01:29:42.877 --> 01:29:44.435
The Wolverine.

01:29:57.759 --> 01:30:00.785
Hey, come here, come here. That's it.

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:02.459
I was wrong.

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:04.530
I told you.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:06.428
Let me have a look at you.

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:08.768
It's nothing.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.598
Hey, thank you.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.612
It's a trap, Logan.

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:43.928
Why have you brought me here?

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:45.836
What are you hiding?

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.698
You will soon find out.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.971
Welcome, Mariko.

01:30:53.147 --> 01:30:56.310
It's all right, Mariko.
She also serves the House of Yashida.

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:57.883
She serves herself.

01:30:58.052 --> 01:31:00.316
She infected Logan.

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.182
And what about Grandfather?

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.785
What did you infect him with?

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.995
I granted his dying wish.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.725
I helped him rest.

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:18.169
Now, it's your turn.

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.585
Did you have a nice rest?

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:16.490
I don't know what you said or did
to deceive Harada or my grandfather...

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.097
Now, now, calm down.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.257
Your grandfather sought me out.

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.431
I am the head of this family now.

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:29.267
And why do you suppose that is?

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:34.081
Why do you think the old man chose you?

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:39.046
Because you are strong?

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:42.114
Or because you are weak?

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.973
I see you've come to fight.

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:40.306
It's pointless.

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.813
You're weak. You're outnumbered.

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:46.943
The Black Clan has protected
the House of Yashida for 700 years.

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:50.049
Is that all the men you brought?

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.986
I'm gonna get her.

01:33:55.596 --> 01:33:57.587
We are grateful
for your protection of Mariko.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:00.893
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:04.296
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.388
Logan.

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.321
<i>Logan.</i>

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.582
<i>Kayla.</i>

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:38.952
<i>- I love you.
- Kayla!</i>

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.082
<i>Logan.</i>

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:45.826
<i>Logan!</i>

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.092
<i>Mariko!</i>

01:36:48.602 --> 01:36:49.591
Jean.

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:51.969
<i>Save me.</i>

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:26.306
Stand back. There is no need.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.440
Where is she? Where's Mariko?

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.541
Where is she?

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:32.638
"Where is Mariko?"

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:35.043
Still pining away?

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.047
That's so sweet.

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:40.119
Impressive, no?

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:43.949
He is made of adamantium, just like you.

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:07.408
Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:09.640
I know she's here. I want to see her.

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:11.981
You want answers.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.248
Yes, I want answers!

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:18.221
I'm sorry, I wish I could say more,
but I was hired in part for my discretion.

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:19.757
I'm sure you were.

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.588
That...

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:26.495
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.935
High-grade toxins are my specialty.

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:35.068
It helps to be genetically immune
to every poison known to man, as I am.

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:40.035
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.546
as I am.

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:45.382
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:49.848
why don't you open these bracelets
and we'll see who's made of what?

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:57.090
The claws. Now we can begin.

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:02.065
I know you care for him.

01:39:02.536 --> 01:39:03.969
You need to let go of that.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:06.296
You are a Yashida.

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:08.473
She betrayed my grandfather...

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.273
and so have you.

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:11.707
No Mariko.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.842
We grew up together.

01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:15.512
You need to trust me.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.479
Let me go to him!

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:21.152
He saved my life!

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:23.720
Let him go, Mariko!

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:25.284
This isn't easy for me but...

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:28.427
I'm following Grandfather's wishes.

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:31.931
The suppressant bug you
found inside of you was mine.

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.859
You took it out on your own.

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.860
I didn't see that coming.

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:39.671
The Viper woman is evil...

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.636
we both know that.

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:44.606
But she's a means to an end...

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:45.943
Where is she?

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.774
An end your grandfather wanted.

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:48.940
You are strong.

01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:50.977
You have courage.

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:53.050
Real courage.

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:59.522
But that won't help much now.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.208
What the...?

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.399
You need to trust me.

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:18.374
Is that hard?

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.673
We were meant to be together.

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:24.184
We still can be.

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:26.584
Perhaps.

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:56.278
Stop!

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:03.716
This is madness.

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:10.488
Let's go.

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.423
Go!

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:16.491
Run!

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.441
Come on.

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.499
- Mariko, come!
- Go! Run!

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:09.220
Mariko, get out!

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:55.113
Come on.

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:57.150
This is not the way.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.161
Two hands.

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:17.769
Master...

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:28.146
Hey! Bub!

01:45:47.874 --> 01:45:48.670
Harada.

01:45:55.349 --> 01:45:56.839
I'm sorry.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.324
Now, you die.

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.501
Today is not my day.

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.113
Hey!

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:45.951
<i>Logan-san.</i>

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.151
Don't look so shocked.

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:54.398
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:57.162
Surely, I could survive this.

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:01.672
It's all right. It won't take long.

01:48:02.242 --> 01:48:05.234
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:09.073
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:14.152
We built it to make me strong,
so I can take what you would not give.

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:17.518
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.586
to my body.

01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:26.161
My legacy must be preserved.

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:30.428
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

01:48:30.604 --> 01:48:31.901
can have no meaning.

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:37.673
It is the only life that can.

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.569
Hold on.

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:42.544
We are almost there.

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:46.743
The peace, the peace you've wanted.

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:49.348
Your reward.

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:53.186
You know,
I'm giving you the very death...

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:55.922
you longed for.

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.766
This feeling...

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:13.435
to be invincible...

01:49:16.049 --> 01:49:17.778
like you.

01:49:30.564 --> 01:49:32.725
You are a monster.

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.359
Mariko.

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.626
It's me. Your grandfather.

01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:41.030
I buried my grandfather.

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:46.832
You asked me to come say goodbye.

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:49.169
<i>Sayonara.</i>

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.395
Are you all right?

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:23.698
Logan.

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:35.753
Logan.

01:51:38.758 --> 01:51:39.918
Logan.

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:53.505
You're here.

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.437
Of course.

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:01.046
Can you stay?

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:05.207
I can't.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.281
Yes, you can.

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:13.252
This is what you wanted.

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:16.760
Not anymore.

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.261
I'm all alone here.

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:30.600
You put me here.

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:34.946
You were hurting people, Jean.

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:37.683
I had to.

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:48.353
I love you, Jean.

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:55.731
I always will.

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:35.271
You are my only family.

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:39.175
Be well, sister.

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:55.822
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.670
Stay.

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:11.833
I can't, princess.

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:16.010
I'm a soldier, and I've
been hiding too long.

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:32.391
<i>In our business profile tonight,
Mariko Yashida.</i>

01:54:32.565 --> 01:54:35.363
<i>A two-generation passing of the torch
in the Yashida family...</i>

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:39.494
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the helm from
her grandfather, who built this tech giant.</i>

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:43.904
I know it will always be the purpose
for a corporation to make a profit...

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:48.343
but Yashida Industries believes
we can also work with our community.

01:54:54.687 --> 01:54:56.882
So, have you decided?

01:54:59.592 --> 01:55:00.354
What?

01:55:00.827 --> 01:55:03.057
Mariko says we can go wherever we want.

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.924
Just say where.

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:07.530
What are you doing?

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:11.432
I'm your bodyguard.

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:17.669
So, where do you want to go?

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.414
Let's just start with up.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.244
And then?

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:30.950
We'll see.

01:55:33.359 --> 01:55:34.621
Interesting.

01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:30.404
<i>With cutting edge technology,
and the world's leading minds...</i>

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:32.168
<i>we are on the frontlines...</i>

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:35.542
<i>keeping you healthy,
keeping you safe.</i>

01:57:36.015 --> 01:57:38.074
<i>Trask Industries.</i>

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:40.549
<i>Solving tomorrow's problems, today.</i>

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:42.853
I'll take the pat-down.

01:57:43.022 --> 01:57:44.011
Opt out.

01:57:56.936 --> 01:57:59.302
- You can go ahead, sir.
- I'll wait.

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.404
What do you want?

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:13.641
There are dark forces, Wolverine.

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:17.414
Human forces building a weapon...

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:21.026
that could bring about the end of our kind.

01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:26.957
What do I want?
I want your help.

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.025
Why would I trust you?

01:58:30.203 --> 01:58:31.534
You wouldn't.

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:57.492
Hello, Logan.

01:59:01.834 --> 01:59:03.699
How is this possible?

01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:06.634
As I told you a long time ago...

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:10.467
you are not the only one with gifts.
