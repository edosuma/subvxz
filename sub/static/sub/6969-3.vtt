along the sternum...

05:10.256 --> 05:12.486

rib fractures,

These deaths match other cases
of multiple fatalities...

inconclusive forensic evidence.

what makes lightning work at all.

06:36.643 --> 06:39.237
- No, I didn't know that.
- Well, I know that,

06:39.345 --> 06:42.143
because I have breakfast with
those scientists every morning
down at the local diner.

- Based on my opinion

medical opinion,

if you had to give one,
what do you think this boy died of?

07:25.225 --> 07:27.819

no other explanation,

07:27.894 --> 07:30.192
right now I'd have to concur
with the coroner--

07:30.263 --> 07:32.891
that lightning is the most
probable cause of death.

or U.F.O.s.

08:13.406 --> 08:16.136

either of those possibilities.

08:16.242 --> 08:18.210
Well, what are you
looking for ?

08:18.278 --> 08:20.803
just because a forensic profile
isn't cut and dry...

08:20.914 --> 08:23.212
-doesn't mean it's not true.
-So Teller's explanation works for you ?

08:23.283 --> 08:25.547

scientific conclusion...

08:25.618 --> 08:27.552
is that Jack Hammond
was killed by lightning.

predictable than Teller realizes.

- How did you know ?

15:33.613 --> 15:36.343
- They came by the garage.
- They did ? How did they find you ?

15:36.415 --> 15:38.679
You tell me.
You must have said something.

15:38.784 --> 15:41.651
No, man !
I didn't say squat.

15:43.489 --> 15:46.686
Wait up !
Come on, man.

15:46.759 --> 15:49.319
- You know I wouldn't do that to you.
- [ Cattle Lowing ]

15:49.395 --> 15:52.728
Hey, you know, I think you want
to be someplace else right now.

15:52.798 --> 15:54.766
'Cause I'm in the mood
for a little barbecue.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.961
No, man.
Not the cows again.

15:57.036 --> 16:00.130
Come on, don't.
Don’t do this.

16:00.206 --> 16:03.471
- Not now.
- [Cattle Continue Lowing]

16:03.542 --> 16:05.476
All right, I'm listenin'.

16:07.113 --> 16:11.015
- I'm ready !
I'm ready, so come on down !
- Don't do it, man !

16:11.117 --> 16:13.051
I'm out of here !

16:13.119 --> 16:17.112
Come on down !
Come and get me !

16:17.223 --> 16:19.487
- [ Grunts ]
- I'm right here !

16:19.558 --> 16:23.153
Come on, man !
I'm waitin' !

16:24.330 --> 16:26.389
Come on, man !
Talk to me !

16:26.465 --> 16:28.399
Come on !

16:49.955 --> 16:51.889
Dude.

16:53.492 --> 16:55.426
Are you okay, man ?

17:04.270 --> 17:06.204
Excellent.

17:13.913 --> 17:16.006
Have that faxed
to my office.

17:16.082 --> 17:18.016
Right away, if you can.

17:18.084 --> 17:20.018
Thank you, Dean.
I appreciate it.

17:23.789 --> 17:25.723
What happened here,
Sheriff ?

17:27.359 --> 17:31.524
- Three dead cows.
How do you think they died ?
- Lightning.

17:31.597 --> 17:34.464
That's right. I just got off
with Dean Greiner at the observatory,

17:34.533 --> 17:36.467
which, by the way, is just about
a mile through those trees.

17:36.535 --> 17:38.469
Did they report
lightning last night ?

17:38.537 --> 17:40.664
They can detect every flash
of lightning on this planet.

17:40.740 --> 17:45.074
Did you know that ?
See, each one emits radio waves
at the exact same frequency--

17:45.144 --> 17:47.339
The Schuman Resonance.
Eight cycles per second.

17:47.413 --> 17:49.904
You can pick it up on any
transistor radio. See that, Sheriff ?

17:49.982 --> 17:52.007
I did my homework.

17:52.084 --> 17:55.315
Not much question that lightning
killed these cows last night,

17:55.421 --> 17:58.185
just like it killed Jack Hammond
the night before last.

17:58.257 --> 18:01.124
Well, that's certainly
the way it looks.

18:01.193 --> 18:04.526
Let me show you something else.
It's right over here.

18:04.597 --> 18:07.930
You see this ?
You know what this is ? Huh ?

18:09.135 --> 18:11.069
It looks like a fulgarite.

18:11.137 --> 18:13.264
That only happens
with lightning--

18:13.339 --> 18:16.172
when sandy soil fuses into glass
from the heat of a discharge.

18:16.242 --> 18:18.176
How much proof
do you need ?

18:18.244 --> 18:20.678
Hmm ?

18:20.746 --> 18:22.839
I'd say your business here
is finished.

18:24.984 --> 18:27.145
Mulder, I'd have to say
I think he's right.

18:27.253 --> 18:29.721
[Mulder] That we're wasting
our time chasing lightning ?

18:29.822 --> 18:31.813
Look at the evidence.
What else could it be ?

18:31.924 --> 18:33.858
I don't know yet.

18:37.596 --> 18:41.760
This is the first lightning strike I've
ever seen that left behind a footprint.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.374
Here we go.

18:51.010 --> 18:53.205
Well, considering
it's a partial imprint,

18:53.279 --> 18:55.509
there's a lot
of information here.

18:55.581 --> 18:58.015
That's great. Now can you make me
a little cherub that squirts water ?

18:59.585 --> 19:02.554
The tread looks like
a standard military boot.

19:02.655 --> 19:04.782
Men's, size
eight and a half.

19:04.890 --> 19:07.154
Eight and a half?
That's pretty impressive.

19:07.226 --> 19:09.558
Well, it says it
right here on the bottom.

19:10.629 --> 19:13.029
But I may have something
even better.

19:13.098 --> 19:15.089
When I was cleaning the imprint
to take the mold,

19:15.167 --> 19:18.898
I found trace amounts
of a viscous substance
actually embedded in the fulgarite.

19:18.971 --> 19:20.632
What is it ?

19:20.706 --> 19:23.800
Well, I’d have to conduct
a chemical analysis to be sure,

19:23.876 --> 19:26.401
but it looks like antifreeze.

19:28.013 --> 19:31.710
- Darin Oswald.
- But why ? And how ?

19:31.784 --> 19:34.048
I don't know, Scully,
but let's go see if the shoe fits.

19:36.822 --> 19:39.416
[Tires Screeching]

19:39.525 --> 19:43.291
- Learn how to drive !
- You think you own the whole road?

19:43.362 --> 19:45.830
God !

19:45.898 --> 19:47.832
Stupid jerk !

19:49.969 --> 19:53.200
Dude, what's happening ?
What's going on ?

19:53.272 --> 19:57.003
I don't know.
Nothing.

20:00.212 --> 20:02.806
You know, I've been thinking.

20:02.882 --> 20:05.612
First time for everything.

20:05.684 --> 20:09.142
- [ Horns Honking ]
- Oh, damn A.B.S. brakes.

20:09.255 --> 20:12.224
I'm thinking
we should go somewhere.

20:12.324 --> 20:15.691
Get out of this hole,
maybe check out Las Vegas.

20:15.761 --> 20:19.492
You could do some serious damage
someplace like that.

20:19.565 --> 20:23.524
I'm not going to Las Vegas.
I'm not going anywhere,
not without Mrs. Kiveat.

20:23.602 --> 20:26.070
What makes you think she's gonna
wanna go anywhere with you ?

20:26.138 --> 20:28.436
She failed you, remember ?

20:28.507 --> 20:30.941
She thinks you're a retard.

20:31.010 --> 20:34.377
Forget school, man.
I'm talking about proving my love.

20:34.446 --> 20:36.505
How are you gonna do that ?

20:36.582 --> 20:39.551
By letting her know
how I feel--

20:39.618 --> 20:41.586
how all I ever think about
is being with her.

20:41.654 --> 20:45.522
Wake up, dude.
There's another slight problem.

20:45.591 --> 20:47.525
She's married to your boss.

20:48.928 --> 20:51.226
- Maybe I could fry him.
- Dude, he's your boss.

20:51.297 --> 20:53.561
Not if he’s dead, he won't be.

20:53.632 --> 20:56.157
Are you high ?

20:56.235 --> 20:58.533
With the F.B.I.
hanging around ?

20:58.604 --> 21:01.471
Just forget about it, okay ?

21:01.540 --> 21:04.703
You can't compete with Frank. He's
good-looking, he's got his own shop.

21:04.777 --> 21:09.544
Plus, he fixes things instead
of just smashing stuff up.

21:12.818 --> 21:17.016
A woman like that
wants someone special.

21:19.792 --> 21:22.693
- I'm special.
- Right.

21:22.761 --> 21:25.594
I'm gonna show her
just how special I am.

21:39.778 --> 21:43.737
[ Laughing ]
That was a good one.

21:43.816 --> 21:45.750
That was a good one.

21:47.186 --> 21:49.746
Come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

21:55.394 --> 21:58.192
Darin ain't worth much.
I'm the first one to say it.

21:58.263 --> 22:00.561
But he wouldn't hurt a soul.

22:00.633 --> 22:03.158
What kind of trouble
is he in anyway ?

22:03.235 --> 22:06.363
Can we have a few minutes,
Mrs. Oswald ?

22:07.740 --> 22:09.674
Thank you.

22:38.637 --> 22:40.571
Mulder.

22:40.639 --> 22:42.903
- Yeah ?
- We've got a size match.

22:42.975 --> 22:45.205
- Eight and a half?
- Yeah.

22:45.277 --> 22:48.371
But it still doesn't prove
that he killed Jack Hammond.

22:49.982 --> 22:51.916
I'm surprised you haven't
already read that issue.

22:51.984 --> 22:56.683
I have. April is the cruelest month.
But mine didn't come with this.

22:56.789 --> 23:00.316
I found that between Miss April
and Women of the Ivy League.

23:00.426 --> 23:01.916
- Who is she ?
- I don’t know.

23:02.027 --> 23:05.121
It looks like it's from some kind
of yearbook photo. See that ?

23:05.197 --> 23:07.188
Hmm.

23:07.266 --> 23:09.530
There's a yearbook
in Darin's closet.

23:25.217 --> 23:27.708
- [ Scully] Her name is Sharon Kiveat.
- Kiveat.

23:27.820 --> 23:30.983
The garage where Darin works
is called Kiveat Auto Body.

23:43.202 --> 23:45.432
[Man]All right,
let's move it through here !

23:48.974 --> 23:50.908
- What happened ?
- Some kid got center punched.

23:50.976 --> 23:53.444
just got his license too.
He's pretty bad off.

23:53.512 --> 23:55.503
Man, that's rough.

23:59.952 --> 24:02.147
You guys ready for me
to start clearing the road ?

24:02.254 --> 24:04.381
I'm just directing traffic.
You better check with the deputy.

24:05.491 --> 24:08.426
- Hey, pal, you okay ?
- Yeah.

24:08.494 --> 24:10.724
You don't look so good.

24:17.803 --> 24:21.000
- [ Screaming ]
- Hey, somebody get the E.M.S. guys !

24:24.109 --> 24:26.634
- You're gonna be okay.
He just collapsed.
- What happened ?

24:29.581 --> 24:31.515
- Pulse is thready.
- I'll get the kit.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.211
Yeah.

24:34.319 --> 24:36.378
It's all right, buddy.
Here we go.

24:39.324 --> 24:43.624
Where you going ? What are you doing ?
Let's get outta here.

24:51.503 --> 24:55.701
I got one, two, three.
All right, give me 300joules.

24:55.774 --> 24:58.106
- Already charged.
- No, it's not.

24:58.177 --> 24:59.974
- Something's not working here.
Get the backup.
- What ? Okay.

25:02.514 --> 25:04.573
[Paramedic]
Hang in there, buddy.

25:11.690 --> 25:14.056
[Darin]
Don't worry, Mr. Kiveat.

25:14.126 --> 25:17.527
I've seen how
they do it on TV.

25:23.268 --> 25:25.327
[Monitor Beeping]

25:27.739 --> 25:30.640
[Man Over Radio]
Dispatch, this is39. That's a negative.

25:30.709 --> 25:33.405
Wait. We got a rhythm.

25:33.478 --> 25:36.106
How the hell--

25:40.018 --> 25:41.952
Rescue 91 1.

25:59.071 --> 26:01.164
Let me give you
a hand with that.

26:02.374 --> 26:05.309
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Kiveat ?

26:05.377 --> 26:08.471
My name is Fox Mulder.
I'm with the F.B.I.

26:08.547 --> 26:11.345
I know this is a hard time for you,
but I'd like to ask you some questions.

26:11.416 --> 26:13.680
You were in my husband's
garage yesterday.

26:13.785 --> 26:15.719
Yes, yeah.

26:20.592 --> 26:23.186
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- I'd like to ask you
about Darin Oswald.

26:23.262 --> 26:26.322
He was at the scene of
the accident, wasn't he ?

26:26.398 --> 26:28.832
Please, I need
to see my husband.

26:39.344 --> 26:42.108
I just talked to one of the
E.M.S. workers. He was pretty rattled.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.740
- Why ?
- Frank Kiveat's electrocardiogram.

26:44.816 --> 26:48.377
Take a look at this. See that
spike there ? That indicates...

26:48.487 --> 26:50.455
that some kind of electrical
intervention started his heart.

26:50.522 --> 26:53.958
Except according to the E.M.S. worker,
the defibrillator wouldn’t charge.

26:54.059 --> 26:56.721
- The paddles were dead.
- How did he explain this ?

26:56.795 --> 27:00.788
He didn't. All he saw was
Darin Oswald touching Kiveat's chest.

27:01.967 --> 27:03.935
I've been going over
Oswald's chart.

27:04.002 --> 27:06.300
There's something I want you
to take a look at.

27:09.675 --> 27:12.439
He was admitted to the E.R.
five months ago in cardiac arrest.

27:12.511 --> 27:15.309
Respiratory failure. Class three burns
on his back and his scalp.

27:15.380 --> 27:18.872
Resuscitated
after 21 minutes.

27:18.984 --> 27:22.784
Hang on, this is odd. His blood test
showed acute hypokalemia.

27:22.854 --> 27:25.652
- Yeah. What is that ?
- It's a severe chemical imbalance...

27:25.724 --> 27:28.158
characterized by high sodium
and low potassium levels.

27:28.226 --> 27:30.660
- Electrolytes, right ?
- Yeah.

27:30.729 --> 27:32.663
And what do electrolytes do ?

27:32.731 --> 27:35.632
Among other things, they generate
the electrical impulses in our body.

27:35.701 --> 27:38.261
It's like every time our
heart beats or a neuron fires--

27:38.337 --> 27:41.067
Okay, it's a leap, Scully, but what if
Oswald's electrolyte imbalance...

27:41.139 --> 27:44.336
is somehow enabling him to
generate electricity at levels
much higher than normal ?

27:44.409 --> 27:46.673
Our body
doesn't work like that.

27:46.745 --> 27:49.805
Unless his body is abnormally
conductive. Because if
that heel print is Oswald's,

27:49.881 --> 27:52.975
that means he conducted millions of
volts of electricity into the ground...

27:53.085 --> 27:56.612
- and just walked away.
- So you’re saying that he's
some kind of a lightning rod ?

27:56.722 --> 27:58.747
No, I'm saying that
he is lightning,

27:58.857 --> 28:00.984
and we've got to get to him
before he strikes again.

28:20.912 --> 28:23.540
Darin !

28:25.217 --> 28:27.811
- Darin.
- Don’t you touch me, man !

28:27.919 --> 28:29.853
- Relax, Darin.
- Don’t you touch me !

28:29.921 --> 28:33.880
We just wanna talk to you, that's all.
just ask you a few more questions.

28:35.227 --> 28:37.161
I didn't do anything.

28:43.969 --> 28:45.903
How many times
do I have to say it ?

28:45.971 --> 28:48.997
I don't know how
all those people died.

28:49.074 --> 28:52.066
[ Scully]
Why did you run when you saw us ?

28:52.144 --> 28:55.739
I was taking a walk. Now,
that's not against the law, is it ?

28:56.948 --> 28:59.007
Anyway, you guys should be
giving me a medal.

28:59.117 --> 29:03.554
- I mean, I saved my boss's life.
- We're not so sure.

29:03.655 --> 29:06.590
Why ? Who told you that ?
Who you been talking to ?

29:06.658 --> 29:10.253
You been talking to Zero ?
He the one who told you that ?

29:18.570 --> 29:20.697
What'd he say ?

29:20.772 --> 29:23.707
Not much,
except that he's a hero.

29:23.775 --> 29:26.767
- How did he say he revived Kiveat ?
- C.P.R.

29:28.313 --> 29:30.247
He claims he paid attention
in health class.

29:30.315 --> 29:32.249
I don't think he just
resuscitated Frank Kiveat.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.284
I think he set
the whole thing up.

29:34.352 --> 29:37.287
- How ? By causing
Kiveat's heart attack ?
- See what he did to my phone ?

29:37.355 --> 29:40.256
So what ? Are we supposed to charge him
with assaulting a cellular phone ?

29:40.325 --> 29:42.919
I think we should run a full set
of lab tests on this guy.

29:42.994 --> 29:47.090
Look where we are.
We don't have the capability
or the time to perform those tests.

29:47.165 --> 29:50.896
And without a confession, we can only
keep him in custody for 72 hours.

29:50.969 --> 29:54.405
I can think of only one other person
who might be able to help us.

29:56.675 --> 29:59.303
Mrs. Kiveat.

29:59.377 --> 30:03.473
Please, I can't do this now.
I'm just leaving for the hospital.

30:03.548 --> 30:06.039
Darin Oswald's in custody,
Mrs. Kiveat.

30:06.151 --> 30:08.813
We arrested him
this afternoon,

30:08.920 --> 30:11.787
but we can't press criminal
charges without your help.

30:13.592 --> 30:16.459
Is it okay
if we come in ?

30:22.534 --> 30:25.662
I teach remedial reading
at the high school.

30:25.737 --> 30:27.864
Darin was my student.

30:27.939 --> 30:30.840
How would you describe
your relationship with him ?

30:30.909 --> 30:35.278
Well, I'm not blind.
I knew he had a crush on me,

30:35.347 --> 30:37.372
but I felt sorry for him.

30:37.449 --> 30:40.782
I thought he was just--

30:40.886 --> 30:44.481
It just seemed he had more than
his share of bad luck.

30:44.589 --> 30:46.819
Did you get him the job
at your husband's garage ?

30:48.960 --> 30:53.021
Yeah. Then about six months ago,
I started getting these phone calls.

30:53.098 --> 30:55.862
Someone would call
and then hang up.

30:55.934 --> 30:57.868
How did you know
it was Darin ?

30:57.936 --> 31:00.370
The way he looked at me
in the garage.

31:03.175 --> 31:05.109
The phone calls made me feel
the same way.

31:05.177 --> 31:07.338
I just knew.

31:07.412 --> 31:10.870
When did you first suspect
that Darin was involved
in something more than prank calls ?

31:12.817 --> 31:15.786
- He told me.
- He actually confessed
to killing those people ?

31:15.887 --> 31:20.187
No, but he, uh,
he told me that he had powers.

31:21.393 --> 31:23.918
- Dangerous powers.
- When was this ?

31:23.995 --> 31:26.828
Right after
the last boy was killed.

31:26.898 --> 31:30.334
jack Hammond.

31:30.402 --> 31:34.736
See, at first I didn't believe him.
I thought he was just mouthing off.

31:34.806 --> 31:38.207
- But after what happened today--
- Did you tell anyone ?

31:38.276 --> 31:40.836
Who would've believed me ?

31:41.980 --> 31:44.642
And I was afraid.

31:44.749 --> 31:48.776
I was afraid of
what he might do tome...

31:48.887 --> 31:50.821
and what he would...

31:52.524 --> 31:55.015
do to my husband.

31:56.228 --> 31:59.857
Well, you don't have to be
afraid anymore.

31:59.931 --> 32:03.059
You and your husband are safe, as long
as we can count on your testimony.

32:16.982 --> 32:19.314
- Where's Oswald ?
- [Teller]I sent him home.

32:19.417 --> 32:23.251
- You released him ? When ?
- After I read your arrest report.

32:23.321 --> 32:26.085
I'm gonna go call

32:26.157 --> 32:29.718
"Suspicion of homicide by emission
of direct electric current."

32:29.794 --> 32:32.262
- You don't really believe this ?
- I believe Darin Oswald...

32:32.330 --> 32:35.231
was involved somehow in the deaths
of those four people,

32:35.300 --> 32:37.768
and I believe it was irresponsible
for you to let him go.

32:37.836 --> 32:41.294
Let me get this straight now.
You're telling me this kid's
throwing lightning bolts ?

32:41.373 --> 32:43.603
- In effect.
- In effect ?

32:43.675 --> 32:45.609
There's no scientific basis
for that claim.

32:45.677 --> 32:49.511
This is speculation based on nothing.
You have no hard evidence, no proof.

32:49.581 --> 32:52.641
You said yourself, Sheriff, even science
can't explain how lightning works.

32:52.751 --> 32:55.219
Mrs. Kiveat's not home.
