00:00.010 --> 00:01.640
Previously on Good Trouble...

00:01.690 --> 00:04.100
You have massages available every day,

00:04.120 --> 00:06.840
and that is our
meditation and yoga room.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.600
You've got the nerve to bother the CEO

00:08.620 --> 00:10.280
over some stupid app idea.

00:10.290 --> 00:11.299
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.879
Maybe we can just get a drink one night.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.300
- Sure.
- I still can't get over

00:14.340 --> 00:15.800
the Judge hiding his son upstairs.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.780
- You get any idea why.
- No.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.890
I hope it's enough to cover
your friends and family rate,

00:19.930 --> 00:21.160
'cause I need a lawyer.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.960
Maybe we can grab dinner some time.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.219
- I am seeing Callie.
- Does she know about me?

00:25.220 --> 00:26.700
It's not a competition.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.640
But if it was, I would
totally win, right?

00:28.690 --> 00:30.160
It's okay. We can see other people.

00:30.180 --> 00:32.460
- Kinda behind on rent.
- Can you ask Mom?

00:32.479 --> 00:33.780
I don't want their help!

00:33.820 --> 00:36.640
Davia's been hooking up with
this guy from her hometown.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.420
- He's married, Davia.
- I know.

00:38.490 --> 00:39.500
You had a kid?

00:39.520 --> 00:41.880
We lost him when he
was six, rare cancer.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.060
You told your friends I'm
clerking the Jamal case?

00:44.100 --> 00:46.080
No one's supposed to know
what cases I'm working on.

00:46.090 --> 00:47.100
You live in a theater.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.740
Do you know everyone who lives there?

00:48.760 --> 00:49.880
No, I don't.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:23.260 --> 01:24.740
Ford Prefect.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.050
Alex and Sam made me be the black guy

01:27.090 --> 01:29.740
because it's like brown-adjacent.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.240
Mariana, I'm really sorry
about what happened.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.640
It's fine.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.660
Are you nervous?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.800
Yes. But I have to tell Judge Wilson

01:49.820 --> 01:52.160
about Malika before Ben does.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.020
Are you sure he knows
that you live with her?

01:54.060 --> 01:55.700
No, but I'm pretty sure

01:55.720 --> 01:58.100
he suspects that I know her somehow.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.580
Well, what do you think
Judge Wilson's gonna do?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.280
Best-case scenario, he takes
me off the Jamal case,

02:03.300 --> 02:05.480
- which will suck.
- Worst case?

02:05.520 --> 02:07.820
I don't wanna think about worst case.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.009
What's with the retro look?

02:10.050 --> 02:12.060
It's Speckulate's fifth
anniversary party,

02:12.080 --> 02:15.100
and it's a costume thing,
'cause, well, nerds.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.820
I'm going as Margaret Hamilton.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.700
- Who?
- She is a brilliant lady engineer

02:19.720 --> 02:22.720
who ran MIT's Instrumentation
Lab in the '60s.

02:22.780 --> 02:24.820
I'm hoping to steal some
of her mental mojo,

02:24.860 --> 02:26.780
even though I'm not half
as smart as she is.

02:26.820 --> 02:28.340
Don't say that. You're brilliant.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.660
Hardly.

02:32.070 --> 02:33.430
Did something else happen at work?

02:34.100 --> 02:36.030
I know you're used to coding
for grades in school,

02:36.050 --> 02:37.180
but out in the world,

02:37.200 --> 02:39.320
there is no such thing as a B plus.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.460
It's good or it sucks.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.820
And this... sucks.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.860
Just... more of the same.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.040
Do you ever feel like
you're an impostor?

02:51.120 --> 02:53.300
Like you tricked someone into hiring you

02:53.320 --> 02:54.880
and you're just waiting
for them to realize

02:54.900 --> 02:56.360
you're not as good as everyone else?

02:57.060 --> 03:00.200
I worked my ass off to get where I am.

03:00.220 --> 03:01.300
And so did you.

03:01.350 --> 03:03.470
Ain't no trick about it.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.660
I have to get to work
before Ben and Rebecca.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.400
But don't doubt yourself.
You're a superstar.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.520
Good luck.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.540
Wow.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.040
I'm speechless.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.630
Did you really just bang
an age-appropriate woman?

03:39.650 --> 03:41.160
- Ha-ha.
- What?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.640
Dennis, with a woman his own age?

03:43.680 --> 03:45.860
- Did I miss it?
- Sadly, yes.

03:45.880 --> 03:46.940
That's like an eclipse.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.260
It will be a while
before it happens again.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.850
Davia, why are you so obsessed
with who I sleep with?

03:51.900 --> 03:55.520
Well, it's either that or talk
about your "music," so...

03:55.580 --> 03:57.539
Why don't you mind your own business

03:57.540 --> 03:59.740
and we don't talk at all.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.160
Damn!

04:05.780 --> 04:08.740
That old woman screwed
the humor out of him.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.480
- Is the judge in yet?
- Not yet.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.380
I'd like to speak with him
as soon as he gets in.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.000
I will let him know,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.240
but you're gonna have to get in line.

04:26.820 --> 04:29.060
Morning. You're here early.

04:34.530 --> 04:39.530
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
...<font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font>...

05:24.920 --> 05:26.580
You wanted to speak to me, Callie?

05:26.640 --> 05:28.020
Yes, sir.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.820
Wait inside my chambers. I'll
be with you in a few minutes.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.520
It's about not getting scolded

05:41.540 --> 05:43.120
for a few misnamed files

05:43.140 --> 05:44.800
and having too much
flair in my comments,

05:44.840 --> 05:48.519
but now Alex is saying that
I'm not experienced enough

05:48.520 --> 05:50.320
to work on any new projects.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.060
This is completely wrong.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.760
Your syntax is sloppy.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.400
You need to cut down on your commenting.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.000
An SEO isn't just for marketing.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.659
There is a technical
aspect to it as well.

06:01.660 --> 06:02.900
I'm stuck doing maintenance,

06:02.920 --> 06:04.520
which sucks because...

06:04.560 --> 06:07.070
now I can't work on Evan's
new secret project.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.240
What?

06:09.520 --> 06:11.120
Congrats, Team Blue.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.540
What did we do?

06:12.570 --> 06:14.060
Got a primo project coming your way.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.700
Evan's top priority.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.980
All confidential.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.060
Evan will unveil the
details at the party,

06:19.080 --> 06:20.500
but I wanted to give you guys a heads-up

06:20.520 --> 06:21.530
so you could get on top of it

06:21.550 --> 06:24.280
ASAFP.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.520
Three words:

06:25.580 --> 06:26.900
New...

06:26.940 --> 06:28.600
...social...

06:28.620 --> 06:29.840
network.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.900
We're gonna destroy Facebook.

06:34.980 --> 06:37.200
The new social network.

06:37.220 --> 06:38.460
I know what it is.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.400
- Oh.
- Okay.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.280
This is passable.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.500
So, uh, when do I get my assignment?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.439
You know, for the...

06:47.440 --> 06:49.520
...new social network.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.700
Yeah. Um, you're not.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.040
The... It's-It's a huge project.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.159
We need experienced engineers.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.370
The guys won't have time to...

07:00.420 --> 07:02.120
uh, hold your hand.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.980
But you'll still focus on
maintenance of existing apps.

07:06.130 --> 07:07.640
That work for you?

07:08.680 --> 07:10.010
Yeah.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.680
And Alex is right.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.239
Syntax is important.
Comments aren't for comedy.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.900
And everyone starts
with maintenance work.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.040
That's how you learn how
things are done around here.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.340
I gotta go.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.820
Sorry, it, uh... took
longer than expected.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.500
So what's on your mind?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.900
I have something I need to disclose.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.320
I know someone...

07:50.380 --> 07:52.540
an activist who's been involved

07:52.580 --> 07:54.800
in protesting the Jamal Thompson case,

07:54.820 --> 07:56.800
and she has a personal relationship

07:56.820 --> 07:58.660
with Jamal's mother Sandra.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.740
Hmm.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.820
- How do you know her?
- She lives in my building.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.340
I've been very careful in all
my interactions with her

08:05.360 --> 08:07.640
to never discuss anything

08:07.660 --> 08:09.440
about the case, but...

08:09.520 --> 08:13.020
there is the appearance of
impropriety to consider,

08:13.080 --> 08:15.580
so I thought it was
important to tell you.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.720
That's significant conflict
of interest, Callie,

08:21.040 --> 08:23.780
one that you should have
disclosed to me weeks ago.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.720
You're off the Thompson case...

08:31.170 --> 08:32.620
and you're fired.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.299
Okay.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.600
I appreciate your candor.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.780
Thank you, sir.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.560
Because you've proved to
me that you're honest

08:47.580 --> 08:50.740
and forthright, I trust
you can be discreet.

08:50.780 --> 08:54.620
Therefore, as long as
you continue to refrain

08:54.660 --> 08:56.340
discussing the case with this person,

08:56.380 --> 08:57.940
I see no reason to take you off it.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.960
Speaking of the Thompson case,

08:59.980 --> 09:02.720
defense filed a motion
this morning to suppress

09:02.740 --> 09:04.720
Officer Griffin's personnel records.

09:04.780 --> 09:05.900
Why? What's in them?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.860
Something they consider prejudicial.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.940
Like a history of using excessive force?

09:09.980 --> 09:11.480
Complaints.

09:11.620 --> 09:14.080
But no disciplinary action
was deemed necessary.

09:14.110 --> 09:15.280
Conveniently.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.020
Read the motion, write up a memo.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.720
I'm sure you'll let me know why...

09:18.800 --> 09:20.310
the motion should be denied.

09:20.350 --> 09:21.680
I'm sure I will.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.520
Can I, uh... ask a favor?

09:26.560 --> 09:28.200
Of course.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.660
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell the others about my son.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.220
That he's not studying abroad.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.780
Actually, that night, I did mention

09:40.830 --> 09:42.120
that I had seen him.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.780
That's all I told them.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.900
Very well.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.560
That's all.

10:15.700 --> 10:19.110
Hey, remember that woman
in the courtroom?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.540
The one you asked me about?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.200
She was with Jamal's mother?

10:22.260 --> 10:23.660
- Uh-huh.
- I realized

10:23.680 --> 10:26.520
I did recognize her from somewhere else.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.280
She, um, lives in my building.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.340
Anyway, I just told the judge.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.760
Really? Hmm.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.260
What did he have to say?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.000
Just as long as I keep my distance

10:36.030 --> 10:37.700
and don't discuss the case with her,

10:37.720 --> 10:39.000
he doesn't think it's a problem.

10:39.590 --> 10:41.200
Wow.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.020
The clerk before you
got taken off a case

10:43.050 --> 10:45.700
for liking a tweet of a friend
of a friend connected to a case.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.860
Whatever you have on
Wilson must be good.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.980
Ben...

10:52.020 --> 10:53.160
the judge will see you now.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.200
That's okay.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.620
I, uh, answered my own question.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.080
I need a lawyer.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.400
You need a lawyer to change your name?

11:25.420 --> 11:26.920
And gender marker.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.780
It's more to it than you think.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.620
Of course lawyers cost money.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.560
I'm not asking you to pay.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.180
I'm just saying, it'd be a
lot easier to get a job

11:36.200 --> 11:37.820
and keep it if I didn't have

11:37.840 --> 11:40.300
to explain when my ID
doesn't say Jazmin on it.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.530
What happened with that retail gig?

11:43.580 --> 11:44.980
I got clocked,

11:45.040 --> 11:47.379
and my manager suddenly cut my hours

11:47.380 --> 11:50.000
so I called her out, and
now I have no hours.

11:50.080 --> 11:51.820
Why does this keep happening?

11:51.880 --> 11:54.180
It's not my fault the
world is full of bigots.

11:55.220 --> 11:57.359
I got to stand up for myself.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.800
For what's right.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.160
How are things in the fishbowl?

12:04.220 --> 12:06.520
This place offered me a full-time gig.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.840
Isn't that more hours?

12:09.680 --> 12:11.520
And responsibility.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.880
But also better pay and benefits.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.060
It's a trap job.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.940
You get used to the
perks of corporate life,

12:18.980 --> 12:21.000
and suddenly, there's
no time for your art.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.320
You don't need that.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.079
Or I need money to make my art.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.080
You'll get by.

12:27.140 --> 12:30.340
Money has a way of working
itself out, especially for you.

12:30.370 --> 12:32.500
It's not just about me, you know.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.360
I have my sister to worry about.

12:34.380 --> 12:37.560
She needs help. Hormones. Rent.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.780
Asking your parents for help an option?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.965
How was your trip back home?

12:42.966 --> 12:44.800
Mom and Dad asked about you.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.960
Me? Or their son?

12:47.180 --> 12:49.220
They're trying to avoid pronouns.

12:49.340 --> 12:50.620
Seems like progress.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.100
Oh, my gosh.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.700
I wish we could be a family again.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.360
That's up to them.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.140
Why don't you meet them half way?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.280
How am I supposed to do that?

13:03.320 --> 13:04.760
Be half of who I am?

13:04.780 --> 13:06.480
I mean, you shouldn't have to, but...

13:06.500 --> 13:09.240
you know, sometimes, you
gotta put up with crap,

13:09.370 --> 13:13.880
you know, to keep people in
your life, to keep a job.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.250
You don't have to drag
everyone who offends you.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.179
Are you close with your parents?

13:19.180 --> 13:23.400
Less since they're having such
a hard time accepting Jazmin.

13:24.050 --> 13:26.000
She hates that I even talk to them,

13:26.020 --> 13:27.880
that I haven't told them that I'm bi.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.020
You know, I don't see the point

13:31.040 --> 13:33.780
until I'm ready to bring
somebody home, you know.

13:35.260 --> 13:38.400
I feel for my sister. I do.

13:39.020 --> 13:42.680
I don't know, she puts up
with a lot of discrimination.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.300
But she can't keep a job.

13:45.620 --> 13:49.400
Well, California has
laws to protect her.

13:51.860 --> 13:54.960
I hate to say it, but...

13:55.020 --> 13:57.640
sometimes I think she
brings it on herself.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.700
- Hey.
- Hey, brother.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.060
What are you doing here?

14:06.100 --> 14:08.500
What does it look like? I'm working.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.080
Tiny tofu tostada?

14:18.580 --> 14:20.590
Smells good. What're you making?

14:21.020 --> 14:22.200
A frittata.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.320
Too scared to fold it over
and call it an omelet?

14:26.320 --> 14:28.040
Oh, if you feel like making two,

14:28.060 --> 14:30.020
I'd be happy to join you.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.639
Oh, shit.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.680
Jeff's just been acting
so weird since I told him

14:37.700 --> 14:39.250
that I've been thinking
about moving back

14:39.260 --> 14:40.280
to Wisconsin.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.199
We were supposed to talk tonight, but...

14:42.200 --> 14:45.040
...now he's saying his wife's
book club got canceled.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.020
Ugh. If that boring shrew
is even in a book club...

14:48.080 --> 14:50.280
So you justify dating a married guy

14:50.310 --> 14:51.330
because his wife's a shrew?

14:51.350 --> 14:52.540
She really is though.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.940
We went to high school together.
She's a total mean girl.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.980
Who's the mean girl now?

14:58.700 --> 15:00.340
Okay,

15:00.380 --> 15:02.640
king of one-night stands, simmer.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.700
So you can dish it out,
but you can't take it.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.500
All you do, Davia, is judge

15:09.520 --> 15:10.890
under the guise of
"calling it like it is"

15:10.920 --> 15:12.500
or "just saying what
everyone else is thinking."

15:12.540 --> 15:14.880
I can guarantee you that
nobody here feels sorry

15:14.900 --> 15:16.820
that your married boyfriend
won't leave his wife.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.560
What if Judge Wilson let
me keep the Jamal case

15:25.580 --> 15:27.120
as like a quid pro quo

15:27.140 --> 15:30.140
for not telling anyone his son's
wearing an ankle monitor?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.860
Well, what if he did?

15:31.900 --> 15:34.000
He trusts your discretion,
and there's no reason

15:34.020 --> 15:35.900
you need to tell anyone
about his son's situation.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.420
Unless his son was arrested by the LAPD

15:38.440 --> 15:40.640
and is waiting to be charged or tried.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.100
Isn't it a conflict of interest

15:42.120 --> 15:44.340
for Wilson to preside
over the Jamal case

15:44.360 --> 15:46.340
if the police were the defendants?

15:46.380 --> 15:48.540
I mean, if he's easy on them,

15:48.570 --> 15:50.800
will they be easy on his
son and vice versa.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.720
I don't know if it's a clear
conflict of interest.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.860
Even if it's a gray area,

15:53.900 --> 15:56.400
maybe that's why Wilson's being
so secretive about Tate.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.320
Or it's a family matter that
Wilson wants to keep private.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.420
It is embarrassing for a
judge's kid to get arrested.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.260
You know, especially one who has his eye

16:04.280 --> 16:05.420
on the Supreme Court.

16:06.140 --> 16:08.380
- I wonder what he did?
- I can find out.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.740
- No!
- Yeah.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.620
No, I don't want him thinking

16:11.630 --> 16:13.940
- that I'm looking into his son.
- Don't worry.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.100
You're not the only one
known for their discretion.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.740
- Well, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.520
I'm sorry I'm always
asking for your advice.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.060
You paid a hefty retainer.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.800
Best dollar I ever spent.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.880
Uh, so it's customary, by the way,

16:29.940 --> 16:32.450
for me to take out new clients.

16:32.490 --> 16:33.779
You know, wine and dine them,

16:33.780 --> 16:35.260
make sure they're happy
with the service.

16:35.660 --> 16:38.200
I am happy with the service.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.580
Just a little overwhelmed.

16:40.660 --> 16:42.380
Oh, sure.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.020
Yeah. Between work, the bar,

16:44.040 --> 16:46.230
and conspiracy theories
about your judge.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.659
Just wanted you to know
if you need a distraction,

16:49.660 --> 16:52.340
consider me on-call.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.839
You new? I work a lot with
Greg, but I've never seen you.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.240
Yeah, it's my first time.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.720
I hate these events.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.020
Why is that?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.400
Liquoring up entitled tech bros

17:22.420 --> 17:23.920
dressed as comic book characters.

17:23.950 --> 17:26.510
My brother's one of those
entitled tech bros.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.740
I'm Zeke.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.280
And I'm sorry.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.760
I'm Jazmin. And I didn't
say I disagree with you.

17:43.340 --> 17:46.220
Don't worry. I'm not
going to embarrass you.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.400
So this is my friend Callie.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.019
Hi.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.360
It's really nice to meet you.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.000
Nice to meet you too.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.420
Um, So Gael filled me in,

17:55.440 --> 17:58.100
and I'm happy to help,
but you don't really need

17:58.130 --> 18:00.320
a lawyer to change your name and gender

18:00.350 --> 18:01.480
on your birth certificate.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.340
Actually, I do...

18:04.300 --> 18:06.360
because I have a felony.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.720
I was at a club

18:18.780 --> 18:20.820
right after I transitioned.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.060
These guys started harassing me.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.340
And someone called the cops.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.310
But when they got there,
they asked me to leave.

18:28.350 --> 18:30.240
Not the guys who were attacking me.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.580
I told them, I know my rights.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.900
But this one cop grabbed me by the arm

18:34.920 --> 18:37.600
and I yanked it back, and he got pissed

18:37.620 --> 18:39.760
and slammed me against the wall.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.540
And he cuffed me for resisting arrest.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.140
Oh, my God, Jazmin, you
have to be more careful.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.700
I had every right to be there.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.920
Was it worth it?

18:47.940 --> 18:49.300
They could have really hurt you.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.840
You did have every right to be there.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.959
And they should not have charged you

18:53.960 --> 18:56.540
since you weren't under
arrest when he grabbed you.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.460
I couldn't afford a lawyer.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.340
And I know I wouldn't be safe in jail.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.680
So I pled guilty,

19:02.720 --> 19:05.080
and I got sentenced to
one year of probation.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.860
Jazmin, why didn't you tell me?

19:09.310 --> 19:11.160
'Cause I didn't want Mom
and Dad to find out.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.200
And I wasn't sure you'd be on my side.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.560
How can you even say that?

19:14.620 --> 19:16.200
I have always been on your side.

19:16.220 --> 19:17.480
Look, you're right.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.560
It is more complicated

19:19.600 --> 19:22.099
if have a record to change
your name and marker

19:22.100 --> 19:25.540
because you have to prove
that you're not trying

19:25.560 --> 19:27.340
to evade the authorities or anything.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.790
But it is doable.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.500
I can't pay you.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.190
- And I don't want you too.
- I'm happy

19:32.210 --> 19:33.220
to help for free.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.400
Truly.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.600
I haven't even passed the bar, so...

19:37.660 --> 19:38.800
Thank you.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.590
You have really nice friends.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.300
You like cheese.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.960
Oh, uh, would you like some?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.680
You know, they spray the
outside of the cheese

20:05.700 --> 20:07.340
with mold to create the rind.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.350
In fact, most of the cheese we eat

20:09.380 --> 20:10.880
has a certain amount of pus in it.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.680
Due to the bacterial
infection in udders.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.440
Wow, that, uh, kinda ruins cheese.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.780
Why?

20:27.940 --> 20:29.340
Which KISS?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.240
I'm sorry?

20:35.730 --> 20:37.080
Oh!

20:39.740 --> 20:41.320
He came up to me.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.360
That's not why I came over here.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.890
He brought up the cheese-pus thing.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.400
Didn't he?

20:56.660 --> 21:00.710
Arthur, Ford, and Zaphod Beeblebrox.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.970
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

21:04.010 --> 21:05.260
Hey, Raj.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.940
Tell Alex that I'm not an idiot.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.780
I know who Arthur, Ford,
and Zaphod Beeblebrox are.

21:09.820 --> 21:12.480
Alex, Sam says he's not an idiot.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.900
Quit being ridiculous, Sam.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.609
Tell Alex that if he wanted
to pick the costumes...

21:18.620 --> 21:20.480
...he shouldn't have put me in
charge of it in the first place.

21:20.540 --> 21:23.460
- Oh...
- The costumes are set.

21:23.540 --> 21:26.740
Kirk. Spock. Bones.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.700
What's wrong with Star Trek?

21:30.780 --> 21:33.500
Uh, more dork than geek at this point.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.419
Okay, so you're trying
to tell me that the late,

21:35.420 --> 21:37.240
great Stephen Hawking is a dork.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.020
Or Neil deGrasse Tyson.

21:39.140 --> 21:40.640
You know, both huge Trekkies,

21:40.660 --> 21:41.670
- by the way.
- Sam. No.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.560
What?

21:50.880 --> 21:53.679
It would just be nice if I felt heard

21:53.680 --> 21:54.930
every once in a while.

21:57.270 --> 21:59.340
Hey, I have an idea.

21:59.380 --> 22:02.360
Maybe you should go to
the party as Mariana.

22:02.380 --> 22:04.420
'Cause that's who you're
acting like right now.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.200
I never gave you final word.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.840
Tell him...

22:12.920 --> 22:14.440
that if he can't delegate,

22:14.460 --> 22:16.020
he's a pretty terrible leader.- -

22:16.040 --> 22:17.480
Pretty sure you heard that...

22:17.520 --> 22:19.880
Raj, tell Sam that talking
to me through you

22:19.920 --> 22:21.160
is extremely childish.- -

22:21.180 --> 22:22.640
Then why is he doing it?

22:22.660 --> 22:23.979
Fine.

22:23.980 --> 22:25.330
We don't have to go as a team.

22:25.350 --> 22:27.860
Go as a Twilight vampire for all I care.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.760
Who's being ridiculous now?

22:30.860 --> 22:32.080
Huh?

22:32.140 --> 22:33.800
Not me.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.760
Well, you're like a kid
in a custody battle.

22:36.780 --> 22:39.000
Whose costume are you gonna choose?

22:39.060 --> 22:42.270
How can I give up the chance
to be Zaphod Beeblebrox.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.040
Beeblebrox. It's just fun to say.

22:45.140 --> 22:48.480
Alex's idea of course. Kiss-ass.

22:49.980 --> 22:52.360
Ugh! Can't believe he made us do that.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.780
God, I was so hungover.

22:53.860 --> 22:55.370
Look how puffy I am.

22:55.390 --> 22:57.620
What? You look great.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.980
My picture on the other hand

23:00.060 --> 23:03.180
might just be the best
photo of me ever taken.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.380
Yeah, you look hot.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.980
Hot Raj!

23:07.720 --> 23:09.580
Now are you gonna keep
fishing for compliments,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.260
or do you need my help
with your screen lag.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.100
I do. Uh...

23:13.160 --> 23:15.880
Okay, so here is your first issue.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.220
You need to start the request
to the server earlier.

23:18.260 --> 23:19.960
Anticipate the data the
user's gonna need.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.460
I knew you were going to save my ass.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.100
What happened to Arthur Dent?

23:59.160 --> 24:00.920
I had to trust...

24:01.480 --> 24:03.960
my team on this one.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.020
Kirk's a classic.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.480
Everybody here tried to outdo
each other with obscure stuff.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.780
Okay, wait. So here...

24:27.900 --> 24:29.599
you should cache the page data

24:29.600 --> 24:31.860
so you don't have to waste
time fetching it later.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.440
It's really gonna slow things down

24:33.460 --> 24:34.940
if you keep repeating your request,

24:34.960 --> 24:36.900
especially as the project grows.

24:37.010 --> 24:38.440
Think it's gonna grow...

24:38.460 --> 24:41.099
...the new social network.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.880
What? You think the market's
saturated, Hot Raj?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.019
I thought you were

24:45.020 --> 24:46.729
a model Speckulate employee.

24:46.730 --> 24:48.320
A real Speckulater.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.500
I'm just saying, if it works,

24:50.520 --> 24:53.720
it will probably be
because you cracked it.

24:54.180 --> 24:55.600
Stop.

24:55.740 --> 24:58.160
I'm serious.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.800
You always have the best ideas.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.320
Wait, what are you doing?

25:07.380 --> 25:08.620
Nothing. I, uh...

25:08.660 --> 25:09.710
Nothing?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.280
I'm sorry. Uh...

25:11.320 --> 25:12.700
Thanks for your help.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.840
So is your brother one of
the bajillion Steve Jobs

25:26.860 --> 25:29.139
- out there tonight?
- No.

25:29.140 --> 25:30.280
That's him over there.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.780
This really isn't his scene either.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.420
Gotta pay the bills somehow.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.060
Sounds like something he'd say.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.260
Smart guy.

25:38.320 --> 25:39.840
He is.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.980
Hey, you wanna get a drink?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.920
I mean, not like right now.

25:45.980 --> 25:48.000
Obviously, that would be...

25:48.120 --> 25:50.280
It would be kinda great, actually.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.120
I'm trans.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.600
- Oh.
- Zeke,

25:54.640 --> 25:55.940
we need you at the van.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.159
Mariana.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.480
Downtown. Don't go there.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.300
I mean, you should not.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.550
Hey.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.000
Okay, who are you?

26:17.060 --> 26:19.900
One of the secretaries
from Mad Men or...

26:19.940 --> 26:21.780
You're a '60s nerd Barbie?

26:21.840 --> 26:24.260
No, I'm MIT's Instrumentation Lab leader

26:24.270 --> 26:25.360
Margaret Hamilton.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.500
She designed the software
for the Apollo missions?

26:30.580 --> 26:32.840
And won the Presidential Medal of Honor?

26:33.600 --> 26:35.800
Like I said, people tried way too hard

26:35.820 --> 26:38.040
with the obscure costumes.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.020
Yeah, well, everyone
knows that Janeway was

26:40.040 --> 26:41.590
the best Star Trek captain!

26:42.220 --> 26:43.919
Oh!

26:43.920 --> 26:45.680
That secretary was angry.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.500
You know who Margaret
Hamilton is, right?

26:53.620 --> 26:54.940
You okay?

26:54.980 --> 26:56.620
I saw you talking to Josh.

26:57.860 --> 27:01.020
First, he gives Alex the big project,

27:01.040 --> 27:03.240
and now he just raked me over the coals

27:03.260 --> 27:06.760
in front of my team for a
totally minor mistake.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.340
That was partially due

27:08.400 --> 27:10.120
to his lack of
communication, by the way.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.360
I'm sure it's nothing.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.980
It's not nothing.

27:13.020 --> 27:14.840
Women don't get to make mistakes.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.560
I hate to even think that,

27:17.580 --> 27:20.300
because I don't want to make
excuses, but it's true.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.500
Do you think Josh ever
blames himself for anything?

27:23.520 --> 27:25.880
No. He gives himself
unlimited chances to fail.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.180
Yeah, and he fails upwards,
every single time.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.860
I get that you don't like
to show any weaknesses,

27:31.020 --> 27:32.780
especially around this group of guys.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.980
I mean, you can't trust them,

27:34.020 --> 27:35.400
even the so-called good ones,

27:35.420 --> 27:38.280
who act like they respect
you and need your help,

27:38.320 --> 27:39.920
but then you end up finding out
they're really just trying

27:39.940 --> 27:41.700
to get into your pants
and they probably knew

27:41.720 --> 27:43.520
what was causing their lag all along.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.100
Sorry.

27:46.180 --> 27:48.120
This is about you right now.

27:48.140 --> 27:51.040
The point is, you can trust me.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.960
The women at Speckulate need
to form a club or something.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.040
Seriously.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.620
We need to support each other.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.100
Wouldn't that be nice?

28:03.680 --> 28:05.430
Your mistakes earlier?

28:05.470 --> 28:07.360
The file names, the comments.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.760
Don't forget the SEO.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.700
Nothing that can't be
learned and corrected.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.820
Look, what you must have,

28:13.860 --> 28:17.730
since Alex has to resort to
surface-level criticisms,

28:17.780 --> 28:19.680
is a real mind for programming.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.660
You deserve to be here.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.000
You too.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.520
Would it have been so hard
to just say that earlier?

28:29.540 --> 28:30.840
Yes.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.660
Excuse me.

28:40.590 --> 28:41.760
Do you live here?

28:41.800 --> 28:42.880
Yeah.

28:42.940 --> 28:44.220
Do you know Dennis?

28:44.260 --> 28:45.880
Ugh. Unfortunately.

28:46.080 --> 28:48.020
Just kidding.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.560
Not. How can I help you?

28:49.580 --> 28:51.820
Well... I buzzed him,

28:51.850 --> 28:53.280
but he must not be home.

28:53.300 --> 28:54.600
Could you give him this?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.120
I said I'd run it by.

28:56.140 --> 28:58.690
- And I don't have a lot of time.
- Yeah.

28:58.730 --> 29:00.180
Who should I say it's from?

29:00.240 --> 29:01.920
Sorry, I should have introduced myself.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.320
I'm Jennifer, Dennis's wife.

29:04.340 --> 29:05.960
Ex-wife.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.700
Ex-wife soon.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.740
Still getting used to that.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.620
- Hmm.
- Thanks.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.240
Hey, no problem.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.260
Here you go.

29:23.300 --> 29:26.020
So Tate Wilson was
arrested a few weeks back,

29:26.040 --> 29:27.660
charged with DUI, possession,

29:27.690 --> 29:29.680
and assaulting a police officer.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.150
Apparently, he took a
swing at one of them.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.100
- Wow.
- But it happened up in Berkeley.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.640
So no conflict of interest
with the police down here.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.480
Guessing the ankle
bracelet was a condition

29:38.500 --> 29:39.980
of letting him come back home to LA?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.260
That is a relief. Thank you so much.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.540
No worries. You know,
you're my favorite client.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.680
Well, if you're free later,
maybe we can grab dinner.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.340
Uh, no, I'm not free.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.380
But I'm willing to
cancel my plans for you.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.560
So, you think we have a case?

30:13.640 --> 30:17.280
That's why I asked Jamie to join us.

30:17.940 --> 30:20.200
Tell me exactly what happened.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.820
So, you're trans?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.540
I just like to be upfront about it.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.220
It's been an issue in the past.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.200
And... don't worry
about drinks. It's fine.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.370
Free tomorrow night?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.260
I'd really like to take you out.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.200
I might be free.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.800
Zeke, big party, this Friday night.

30:43.820 --> 30:45.100
You free to work?

30:45.120 --> 30:46.540
- Yeah, sure.
- All right. Good.

30:46.570 --> 30:48.680
Uh, I need more girls so
let's put the word out.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.080
Oh, I can work Friday.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.260
Yeah, look, uh... I didn't realize

30:53.280 --> 30:55.060
until I saw your start paperwork

30:55.100 --> 30:58.440
that you're n-not a...

30:58.460 --> 30:59.600
A what?

31:00.750 --> 31:01.780
Look, you lied to me.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.260
I didn't lie to you.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.119
This is just a name on a check.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.190
I'm a woman.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.680
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing new.

31:08.860 --> 31:10.280
It's okay. Let's just go.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.400
- Come on, Greg.
- Hey, look, it's not me.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.780
It's the client, okay.

31:13.820 --> 31:15.280
People get uncomfortable.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.300
I'm sorry, what people?

31:17.340 --> 31:19.240
I didn't see anyone
uncomfortable today but you.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.540
It's not worth it. Let's just go.

31:20.570 --> 31:21.630
No. This is bullshit.

31:21.660 --> 31:23.760
- And who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother. All right.

31:23.780 --> 31:24.980
And who the hell are you?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.440
Besides some bigoted asshole?

31:26.470 --> 31:28.200
Oh, man, you gotta get out of my face.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.460
Or what, huh?

31:29.620 --> 31:32.800
Gael, it's not worth your job.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.320
Let's just go.

31:34.380 --> 31:35.720
Come on.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.920
Yeah, you definitely have cause to sue.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.740
But these things, they
cost a lot of money.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.500
And I'm sure the caterer has insurance

31:48.520 --> 31:50.060
that will cover all
their legal expenses.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.580
I'll cover Jazmin's expenses.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.040
No, you won't.

31:53.060 --> 31:54.980
I'm gonna take the full-time
job at Speckulate.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.620
Don't do that for me.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.160
I'm not. I've thought about it,

31:59.210 --> 32:01.160
and it's a good opportunity for me.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.580
Look, I'm so sorry, Jazmin.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.440
You were right. I haven't always been

32:09.470 --> 32:10.880
on your side enough.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.580
But you can't keep
dealing with this shit.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.340
And people can't keep
getting away with it.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.180
Look, if we win, you
could get some money

32:17.220 --> 32:18.520
to get you on your feet.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.320
What about your art?

32:20.380 --> 32:22.760
I'm not gonna give up on that.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.260
I just gotta be more
hardcore about doing it

32:24.280 --> 32:26.040
nights and weekends.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.480
It's all good.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.480
We appreciate any help
you guys can give us.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.600
- Oh, sorry, I...
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

32:50.620 --> 32:52.320
- No, no, I just...
- I was just working.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.560
- You go.
- Go ahead.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.720
Okay, I'll go.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.080
I just wanted to ask...

33:01.100 --> 33:02.400
if you hate parties.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.310
Um... no.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.920
Oh. Because I noticed that
you were by yourself...

33:10.000 --> 33:13.280
alone... a lot.

33:13.320 --> 33:15.960
No, no, it was, it was a great party.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.280
Thank you so much.

33:17.330 --> 33:19.100
I thought it was boring.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.140
In social situations,

33:21.170 --> 33:23.760
I don't really like to talk to people.

33:24.340 --> 33:27.280
I find the energy I give
out doesn't really have

33:27.300 --> 33:29.580
a compensatory return.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.820
In most cases.

33:31.880 --> 33:35.680
Well, yeah, that's true of
some people around here.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.300
- Me?
- No.

33:38.340 --> 33:40.470
No. No. You're not boring.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.560
Really?

33:46.800 --> 33:48.140
Thank you.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.500
You're not boring either.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.980
Thank you.

33:55.780 --> 33:58.000
Uh, oh, sorry.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.500
I dropped one of my bullets.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.380
- Bullets?
- Uh, no, they're not real bullets.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.830
They're, uh, these magnetic things.

34:03.870 --> 34:07.950
They help... me.

34:07.970 --> 34:10.540
I think it fell under
the desk over there.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.130
Oh, uh...

34:12.170 --> 34:13.600
Oh...

34:13.699 --> 34:15.000
I-I'll get it.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.020
Mariana, um, can we please talk?

34:24.620 --> 34:26.219
- Found it.
- I'm sorry,

34:26.340 --> 34:27.719
I can come back.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.400
It's okay. Good night.

34:35.639 --> 34:39.020
Anyway, I-I misread all
the signals last night...

34:39.040 --> 34:40.980
Look, it's fine, Raj.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.100
Really. There's nothing to talk about.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.159
Okay.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.679
Well, I really am sorry.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.300
Actually, you know what?

34:54.719 --> 34:56.199
It's not fine.

34:56.699 --> 35:00.880
And it's, it's not about
misreading signals,

35:00.960 --> 35:02.850
it's about it being
totally inappropriate

35:02.880 --> 35:04.600
to try to kiss one of your co-workers.

35:05.890 --> 35:07.100
I mean, like, duh.

35:07.140 --> 35:09.920
I-I mean, seriously,
did you really think

35:09.940 --> 35:12.140
that asking me to help
you with your work

35:12.170 --> 35:14.940
and, and telling me that
I have such great ideas

35:14.960 --> 35:16.880
and then trying to kiss me

35:16.900 --> 35:19.860
wouldn't make you look like
you're completely full of crap.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.740
And make me feel even more
disrespected and vulnerable

35:22.780 --> 35:24.360
than I already do around here?

35:25.100 --> 35:27.100
So sorry.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.980
But sorry doesn't cut it.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.600
The case is winnable, right?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.600
It's definitely worth pursuing.

35:46.930 --> 35:49.040
If she's willing to go
through the wringer for it.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.280
You think your firm could
take it on pro bono?

35:51.300 --> 35:53.720
Look, if we can't, I'll try
to find someone who can.

35:53.740 --> 35:55.380
At least at a nice discount.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.640
Thank you.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.920
Oh, um, Gael...

36:02.000 --> 36:03.820
just a friend?

36:03.870 --> 36:07.180
It's not my business. I just
like to know who I'm up against.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.080
Well, we are seeing other people,

36:11.100 --> 36:12.700
if that's what you're asking.

36:46.060 --> 36:47.740
This is for you.

36:48.320 --> 36:49.760
From Jennifer.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.320
I met her in the lobby.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.660
So you were married.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.600
That seem so crazy?

36:59.620 --> 37:01.180
Honestly?

37:01.260 --> 37:02.600
Totally bonkers.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.540
I...

37:06.120 --> 37:07.940
I know I'm judgmental.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.460
Which is really weird because...

37:10.560 --> 37:11.740
I've been judged my whole life

37:11.760 --> 37:14.320
for being fat, anorexic...

37:15.340 --> 37:17.080
dating a married guy.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.120
I know how awful it feels.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.140
So why am I judging people back?

37:26.180 --> 37:30.620
A nice person wouldn't do that, so...

37:30.740 --> 37:33.320
I guess I'm not a nice person.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.480
This is where you're
supposed to disagree.

37:37.500 --> 37:38.510
Oh.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.799
My bad.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.660
You're really nice.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.460
Way to sell it.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.080
So did she cheat on you?

37:49.360 --> 37:51.740
Is that... why you wigged out

37:51.770 --> 37:53.420
- on me yesterday?
- No.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.480
I cheated on her.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.560
So, yeah...

38:08.100 --> 38:09.500
no right to judge.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.480
Why'd you do it?

38:11.500 --> 38:12.880
It's complicated.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.280
But it wasn't because I was in love

38:14.300 --> 38:16.260
with the other woman or...

38:16.300 --> 38:19.320
because I ever stopped loving my wife.

38:21.280 --> 38:23.940
No matter what you may think or hope

38:23.980 --> 38:25.920
with this guy...

38:28.200 --> 38:30.020
you know it doesn't end well.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.200
Yeah.

38:36.300 --> 38:37.680
What are you playing?

38:38.310 --> 38:40.380
I thought you didn't want
to talk about my music...

38:40.400 --> 38:42.200
- Oh, come on.
- ...Davia.
