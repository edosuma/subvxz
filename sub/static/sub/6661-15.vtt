UGH.
HEY, COME ON.

41:46.535 --> 41:48.506
THAT'S THE DEAL
YOU MADE, MAN.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.679
YOU TELL ANDI
YOUR SECRET,

41:50.679 --> 41:51.640
YOU OWE ME A FAVOR.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.182
OR WE COULD DISCUSS
THE CONSEQUENCES

41:54.182 --> 41:57.285
FOR YOU AND ANDI
IF YOU REFUSE.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.218
WELL, SAM?

42:00.218 --> 42:02.220
WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

42:02.220 --> 42:04.192
SAM?

42:04.192 --> 42:05.053
HEY!

42:05.053 --> 42:06.795
THOUGHT I SAW YOU
OUT HERE.

42:06.795 --> 42:08.526
WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON IN?

42:08.526 --> 42:09.658
I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW--

42:09.658 --> 42:12.200
I THINK YOU COULD BE
A REAL HELP. COME ON INSIDE.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.802
THERE'S, UH...

42:13.802 --> 42:18.166
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
I REALLY WANT YOU TO MEET.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.840
COME ON.

42:22.210 --> 42:23.842
COLD OUT HERE.

42:23.842 --> 42:26.244
Sam: YEAH, IT'S FREEZING.
