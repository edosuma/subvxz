Mom, Reese is poking me!

That's it, you two.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.096
Either side of the couch-- now!

00:10.532 --> 00:11.881
He's still poking me!

00:11.968 --> 00:13.535
Reese, go to your room!

00:13.622 --> 00:17.104
I don't want you
within 30 feet of him!

Come on, Hal!
We're gonna be late.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.419
Fine, but I don't see
what the big deal is.

01:11.506 --> 01:13.247
So what if he stopped
drinking for a year?

01:13.334 --> 01:14.248
I thought
that's what

01:14.335 --> 01:16.250
you're supposed to do in AA.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.121
Francis' one-year anniversary
of sobriety

01:18.208 --> 01:19.905
is very important to him.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.385
Sounds to me
like it was just dreamed up

01:21.472 --> 01:23.126
by the greeting card companies.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.259
What is wrong with you?

01:25.346 --> 01:28.349
Francis has joined AA
and is turning his life around.

01:28.436 --> 01:29.741
These are the people
who helped him do that,

01:29.828 --> 01:31.569
and he wants us to meet them.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.528
Where were they when he needed
to learn to ride a bicycle?

01:33.615 --> 01:34.920
Or when he lost
his first tooth?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.705
We did all the heavy lifting,

01:36.792 --> 01:38.576
and now these guys
get all the glory.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.056
I can't believe you're jealous
of these people.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.318
Well, what does
he need us for?

01:41.405 --> 01:42.493
He's got them now.

01:42.580 --> 01:43.799
We're useless.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.540
We're like his appendix.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.020
Now he's just going to open up
his stomach, remove us,

01:48.108 --> 01:49.631
and put us in a jar
up on a shelf,

01:49.718 --> 01:51.328
right there in
the living room...

01:51.415 --> 01:53.287
or the den, or...

01:53.374 --> 01:55.506
mantelpiece,
if he's got one.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.595
[sighs]
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

01:57.682 --> 01:58.901
Where's Jamie?

01:58.988 --> 02:00.685
-[car horn honks]
-There he is.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.905
He's been dying to go to
that sitter's all morning.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.211
I swear that
woman feeds him

02:04.298 --> 02:05.777
nothing but sugar
all day long.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.822
[honking continues]

02:06.909 --> 02:09.477
I'm coming!

02:09.564 --> 02:11.218
Bye, Mom-- say
hi to Francis.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.784
Oh, wait, wait,
all right.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.090
You've got your food money.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.874
You've got
your emergency numbers.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.224
We'll be home
Sunday night around 9:00.

02:17.311 --> 02:20.531
But before I forget.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.707
This is the one thing left
in this house that I care about.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.796
I don't want to spend
the next two days worrying about

02:24.883 --> 02:26.972
"How will they break it,
where will they hide the pieces,

02:27.059 --> 02:28.670
how will they lie to me
about it when I come home?"

02:28.757 --> 02:30.802
So...

02:30.889 --> 02:32.152
[vase shatters]

02:32.239 --> 02:34.763
There. Now I can relax.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.553
I'm bored.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.685
Mom and Dad are gone.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.426
You want to make
some crank calls?

02:45.513 --> 02:47.906
Nah. I guess I'm getting old.
I'm really not inspired.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.734
We could cherry bomb
Ms. Waller's mailbox.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.258
What's the point?

02:51.345 --> 02:53.085
She'd just chase me,
have an asthma attack.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.870
The neighbors would call 9-1-1.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.002
I'd get away with it
because of her blackout.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.961
We'd both just be going
through the motions.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.658
You're right.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.356
Terrorizing the same
old neighbors year after year

03:02.443 --> 03:04.227
just doesn't
feel satisfying anymore.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.447
Maybe we're growing up.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.710
Maybe we don't need to go out
and create random havoc.

03:08.797 --> 03:11.234
Hey, guys, I was digging around
in the garage,

03:11.321 --> 03:13.323
and I found
the spare key to Dad's car!

03:15.020 --> 03:16.674
Do you know
what this means?

03:16.761 --> 03:17.980
We can key stuff!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.808
No, we have mobility.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.418
We can drive over
to the next city.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.854
And key stuff there!

03:22.941 --> 03:25.379
And key stuff there, and
cherry-bomb stuff there.

03:25.466 --> 03:28.599
Reese, we have access
to a car with no
adult supervision.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.645
We can do whatever we want,
and if we get caught?

03:30.732 --> 03:32.951
They'd blame Mom and Dad
for being absentee parents.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.475
This is the
perfect crime.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
I was thinking we could drive
to the arcade.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.435
Arcade?
What are you, 12?

03:38.522 --> 03:40.568
-Yeah.
-Dewey, get out of the way.

03:40.655 --> 03:41.873
Malcolm and I have
to plan some pain.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.614
What about South High?

03:43.701 --> 03:45.616
I think their band practice
starts in like two hours.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.792
Perfect. I still
have some connections
at the slaughterhouse.

03:47.879 --> 03:50.578
One phone call, and I got
a trunkful of pig's blood.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.799
[train horn blasting]

03:54.886 --> 03:56.453
[baby wailing]

03:56.540 --> 03:58.803
It's humble,
but it's home.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.675
Actually, they just
walled off a bedroom

04:00.762 --> 04:03.982
from the apartment
next door, but anyway,

04:04.069 --> 04:05.462
it's home.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.856
Uh, you know, Francis,
your mother and I

04:07.943 --> 04:09.858
passed a motel
on the way here...

04:09.945 --> 04:12.730
Nonsense. I won't have my
parents staying at some motel.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.428
-You can sleep here.
-[hip-hop music blasting]

04:14.515 --> 04:16.778
-On the rug?
-It's a futon.

04:16.865 --> 04:17.995
Believe it or not,
someone was actually

04:18.083 --> 04:19.476
going to throw that away.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.349
-You know, my back--
-Hal, let him do this.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.959
All righty, we'll stay.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.874
Great!
You know, I'm really glad

04:25.961 --> 04:27.832
you guys came up here
for my celebration.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.486
Speaking of which...

04:29.573 --> 04:31.053
-Piama!
-It's fine.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.620
Really, Mom,
I have a handle on it.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.187
Besides we're not just
celebrating my sobriety.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
We're also celebrating

04:37.364 --> 04:39.191
my new job.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.889
Francis, that's wonderful!

04:40.976 --> 04:42.238
What is it?

04:42.325 --> 04:43.848
A laser-etched crystal.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.155
It's the perfect fusion
of science and art.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.853
Wow, the detail is amazing.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.508
And you can see everything
on this nude fairy.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.031
-That's me.
-[gasps]

04:53.118 --> 04:54.859
FRANCIS: You can put
whatever image you want

04:54.946 --> 04:56.818
in these crystals, but it
all adds up to one thing:

04:56.905 --> 04:59.516
financial independence
in five to 12 years.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.562
We're starting
our own business.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.737
FRANCIS: We already looked
into the franchise

05:02.824 --> 05:04.304
and locked down
the location.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.262
Now all we have to do is
work out the financing.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.003
-Oh?
-Don't worry, Mom,

05:08.090 --> 05:10.135
we don't need any money--
we already got $10,000

05:10.222 --> 05:11.920
from Piama's mom's
lawsuit settlement.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.791
The newspaper used her picture
without her permission

05:13.878 --> 05:15.967
for an article
on mental defectives.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.100
All we need from you
is to co-sign the loan.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.841
We hate to ask, but
you're the only people

05:19.928 --> 05:21.973
Piama and I could
turn to for this.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.497
Did you hear that, honey?

05:23.584 --> 05:25.890
-He's turning to us.
-How much?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.415
It's just a small
business loan: $20,000.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.155
$20,000?!

05:30.242 --> 05:32.375
And none of your drunk friends
could help you out on this, huh?

05:32.462 --> 05:34.290
Not at all.
Oh, and don't worry,

05:34.377 --> 05:35.813
The bank already
ran your credit.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.945
It's horrible, but all
that means is they just

05:37.032 --> 05:38.512
crank up the
interest rate.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.383
In what world would you
think we would sign that?

05:40.470 --> 05:43.473
Honey, come here.
Let's hear the boy out.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.345
You heard him;
he needs us.

05:45.432 --> 05:46.868
Hal, I'm not going
to sign anything.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.478
We're in enough debt
as it is.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.784
-Lois...
-I hate to do this,

05:49.871 --> 05:51.916
but can we talk
about this later?

05:52.003 --> 05:54.005
-We really got to get
to my AA party.
-Of course!

05:54.092 --> 05:56.268
I gotta tell you, son,
I am drunk as a skunk

05:56.356 --> 05:59.141
with pride right now.
[chuckling]

06:00.882 --> 06:03.275
Okay, we have 12 hours
and eight gallons of gas.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.974
This is our radius
of destruction.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.323
So much to do,
so little time.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.194
What about my old
4th grade teacher?

06:09.281 --> 06:10.544
If we get
Mr. Bradshaw,

06:10.631 --> 06:11.719
then we can't moon
the girls' school.

06:11.806 --> 06:12.894
No, the mooning
is a definite.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.330
For you to even
suggest that

06:14.417 --> 06:15.853
makes me really question
your commitment.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.638
If I give you Bradshaw,
then I can't do donuts

06:17.725 --> 06:19.379
on the lawn of my old
basketball coach.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.642
-What about the arcade?
-Not now, Dewey.

06:21.729 --> 06:22.556
All right,
I'll give you the donuts.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.340
Great.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.474
So which way are we leaning
on the whole cat show situation?

06:27.561 --> 06:28.649
If you get me
that coyote,

06:28.736 --> 06:30.172
then I'll get you
to the cat show.

06:30.259 --> 06:33.131
-The arcade is on the way
to the cat show.
-Out!

06:33.218 --> 06:34.785
Hey, are we still peeing
in the mailbox

06:34.872 --> 06:36.091
on Fifth, or aren't we?

06:36.178 --> 06:37.309
I've already drank
three of these.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.137
Do not embarrass me
out there.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.100
Come on, Reese,
we are so close.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.406
Do you really
need five minutes

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
to work over your
old lab partner?

06:54.849 --> 06:56.372
Yeah.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.853
Why do something if you're
not gonna do it right?

06:58.940 --> 07:02.030
All right, do you think
you could work your boy over
in the backseat of the car?

07:02.117 --> 07:03.466
What are you getting at?

07:03.553 --> 07:04.554
After we push over
those gravestones,

07:04.641 --> 07:06.034
we can pick up the lab partner.

07:06.121 --> 07:07.078
By the time
you're done with him,

07:07.165 --> 07:08.645
we're at the promenade,

07:08.732 --> 07:10.430
where we do our pedestrian-only
drive through.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.257
Then it's a straight shot
down 45th Street,

07:12.344 --> 07:14.042
just in time for the old folks'
health walk.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.914
A quick streak,
and, dude, we're done!

07:17.001 --> 07:18.350
-Yeah!
-Ah!

07:18.438 --> 07:20.222
REESE: All right,
we have to get going.

07:20.309 --> 07:21.658
We need the car key.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.399
Are we going to the arcade?

07:23.486 --> 07:24.966
We already told you we don't
have time for that, Dewey.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.663
You know something?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
I don't remember where I put it.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.928
Stupid! How could
you misplace it?!

07:31.929 --> 07:33.714
Wait a minute,
he's lying.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.455
Dewey, give us the key now!

07:35.542 --> 07:37.152
Nope.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.284
All right, Dewey,
we can either do
this the easy...

07:39.371 --> 07:40.285
[screams]

07:40.372 --> 07:42.026
No fair.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.899
That's just what
I was gonna do.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.643
FRANCIS: Crash!

07:49.730 --> 07:52.210
Frankie, my man!

07:54.343 --> 07:56.301
-Little Miss P.
-Hey, baby.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.868
Crash, I'd like you
to meet my dad.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.696
Hello.

07:59.783 --> 08:00.784
Stay strong, brother.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.743
Okay.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.049
And this is my mother.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.532
-She's real?
-Excuse me?

08:09.619 --> 08:13.493
It's... I thought...

08:15.059 --> 08:17.279
I don't know what I thought.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.411
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.807
What was that
all about?

08:23.894 --> 08:25.896
[whistles]

08:27.507 --> 08:28.986
[boys grunting]

08:29.073 --> 08:30.205
MALCOLM: Give it up, Dewey!

08:30.292 --> 08:33.381
DEWEY: No!

08:33.469 --> 08:35.035
Tell us where
the key is!

08:35.123 --> 08:37.517
No!

08:37.604 --> 08:40.650
[all grunting]

08:41.912 --> 08:43.131
Tell us where
the key is!

08:43.217 --> 08:44.872
No.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.005
Give us the key.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.964
No.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.751
That was our last worm!

08:54.838 --> 08:56.100
It's no use.
He's immune.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.624
It's our own fault--
we've been torturing him

08:57.711 --> 08:59.539
since Mom brought him home
from the hospital.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.931
Remember when he was a baby?

09:01.018 --> 09:02.803
I could make him cry,
just like that.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.456
Now we're stuck
with this.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.244
[humming]

09:10.724 --> 09:12.682
We've all come a long way,

09:12.769 --> 09:15.598
but we still have
a long way to go.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.469
[applause]

09:18.993 --> 09:21.038
None of us could have gotten
to where we are today

09:21.125 --> 09:22.910
if it wasn't for everyone here.

09:22.997 --> 09:27.131
But there is one man that I
would especially like to thank.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.263
Francis!

09:28.350 --> 09:29.873
[applause, affirmations]

09:29.960 --> 09:32.441
Francis...

09:32.528 --> 09:35.009
your honesty has really
helped me through this.

09:35.096 --> 09:38.621
I went through life feeling
pretty sorry for myself,

09:38.708 --> 09:41.363
thinking that I was
brutalized and abused,

09:41.450 --> 09:44.235
but then I heard
your horror stories,

09:44.322 --> 09:47.499
and I realized
that my junkie, abusive mom

09:47.587 --> 09:48.892
wasn't that bad at all.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.286
Oh, sure, she beat me,

09:51.373 --> 09:53.201
she left me
in that dumpster and all,

09:53.288 --> 09:57.161
but she was a saint
compared to "L."

09:57.248 --> 09:58.554
[scattered calls of agreement]

09:58.641 --> 10:00.121
I don't know
how you survived her, man,

10:00.208 --> 10:02.079
but I thank God you did.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.039
[applause]

10:05.126 --> 10:06.475
"L"?!

10:06.562 --> 10:09.913
Hal, can you believe this?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.308
[sobbing]
They are so open here.

10:13.395 --> 10:14.439
It's just so raw!

10:14.526 --> 10:17.617
It's beautiful.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.357
Let's be fair.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.838
We all have an "L" in our lives.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.884
[murmurs of agreement]

10:23.971 --> 10:27.278
My "L" was the Vietnam War.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.976
Thankfully, though,
I don't have to visit my "L"

10:29.063 --> 10:31.543
on Christmas and holidays.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.807
I can leave my "L" buried deep

10:33.894 --> 10:37.593
in the darkest recesses
of my mind.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.640
And I thank God for that.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.032
Stay strong, Francis.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.426
[applause and cheering]

10:47.472 --> 10:51.389
And now, let's hear
from the man of the hour:

10:51.476 --> 10:53.870
our very own Francis.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.441
[indistinct cheers]

10:59.528 --> 11:00.703
Thanks, George.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.792
Thank you all.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.882
A lot of horrible things
have been said tonight,

11:05.969 --> 11:08.450
and I appreciate your honesty,

11:08.537 --> 11:11.583
but that's in the past.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.630
We need to clean the slate
and start over, and to do that,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.764
we need to make amends
to the people we have wronged.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.637
To my beautiful wife, Piama...

11:21.724 --> 11:23.900
...for all the terrible things
I put you through...

11:23.987 --> 11:27.121
I'm sorry.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.211
And to my brothers,
who aren't here right now,

11:30.298 --> 11:32.561
for all the times
I couldn't be there for you

11:32.648 --> 11:36.173
'cause I was
in my own messed-up place...

11:36.260 --> 11:38.001
I'm sorry.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.222
To my father...

11:41.309 --> 11:44.051
I put you through so much,

11:44.138 --> 11:46.009
yet you were
always there for me.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.621
I'm sorry.

11:51.580 --> 11:55.410
And to my mother, L...

11:57.064 --> 12:00.284
...I forgive you.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.851
[crowd cheering]

12:01.938 --> 12:04.985
You forgive me?!

12:15.517 --> 12:19.782
Okay, it's a bit extreme,
but Dewey has left us no choice.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.611
Since he's withstood
our most horrible tortures,

12:22.698 --> 12:24.352
Reese and I have to do something

12:24.439 --> 12:26.920
that goes against everything
we believe in this house.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.922
How thin do you want the ham?

12:29.009 --> 12:30.401
Same as the last sandwich.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.753
How's the milkshake?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.885
Mm, quite nice.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.148
You'll notice there's no snot,
spit or pee in there.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.107
I thought it tasted different.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.935
And the massage is amazing.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.501
You got tension
out of my shoulder

12:43.588 --> 12:45.286
I didn't even know was there
till it was gone.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.244
I feel eight!

12:47.331 --> 12:48.637
Can we get you
anything else?

12:48.724 --> 12:51.858
Well, there is
one thing... nah.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.251
No, what is it?

12:54.338 --> 12:56.036
It's a little childish.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.256
Nonsense, Dewey.
Come on, this
is your day.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.041
I would really love
a piggy-back ride

13:01.128 --> 13:02.303
around the neighborhood.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.478
I'll get my shoes.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.567
Guys, this is fantastic.

13:05.654 --> 13:08.178
I really think we've healed
a lot of wounds today.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.530
Really? That's great, Dewey.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.402
You know, I was thinking,

13:14.489 --> 13:16.230
you're full,
you're relaxed,

13:16.317 --> 13:17.753
you're watching your
favorite TV show...

13:17.840 --> 13:19.233
Do you think
we could have

13:19.320 --> 13:21.104
that, uh, car key now?

13:21.191 --> 13:23.715
You know something?
You guys have earned it.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.065
You really have.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.242
And I wish
I could give it to you.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.547
What do you mean?

13:29.634 --> 13:31.027
You guys threw me a curveball.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.681
I had no idea
it was going to go this way.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.769
Bravo.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.772
-But I swallowed it.
-What?

13:36.859 --> 13:39.383
I know.
It was foolish and spiteful,

13:39.470 --> 13:42.909
but this was
before we reconnected.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.302
Hey, is there any more
of this shake left?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.653
LOIS:
Unbelievable!

13:48.740 --> 13:50.481
You invite me up here
for a celebration,

13:50.568 --> 13:52.788
and instead,
you blindside me?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.269
You told complete strangers
that I'm a monster!

13:55.356 --> 13:56.966
Mom, I acknowledge your anger.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.925
Well, get ready
to acknowledge a lot more!

13:59.012 --> 14:00.361
Oh, you "forgive me,"
Francis?

14:00.448 --> 14:02.754
Do you forgive me
for 27 hours of labor?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.278
For staying up
all night with you

14:04.365 --> 14:06.193
when you were sick
with 105-degree temperature?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.108
For the thousands of hours

14:08.195 --> 14:09.805
I spent trying to get you
to do your homework?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.720
Yes, Mom, I forgive you.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.244
So it's all my fault
that your life is messed up

14:14.331 --> 14:15.419
and you're an alcoholic?

14:15.506 --> 14:16.377
I'm the source
of everything

14:16.464 --> 14:18.292
wrong with your life?

14:18.379 --> 14:19.510
Mom, I'd love to get
into this, but we
don't talk about

14:19.597 --> 14:20.990
these things
outside the meeting.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.339
Well, get in the car.
We're going back!

14:22.426 --> 14:25.212
Uh, Lois, let's not ruin
Francis' special day.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.996
Why not? Apparently,
I've ruined everything else!

14:27.083 --> 14:28.606
What's past is past.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.479
"What's past is past"?!

14:31.566 --> 14:34.569
So you think
this is all my fault, too?

14:34.656 --> 14:36.919
Can we discuss this
in the other room?

14:37.006 --> 14:39.574
There is no other room!

14:45.885 --> 14:48.583
Just admit it, guys:
You've been beat.

14:48.670 --> 14:49.758
Are you kidding?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.020
Now that we know
where the key is,

14:51.107 --> 14:52.935
it's only a matter of time.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.285
Here's Grandma's special cereal.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.679
That stuff is so powerful,

14:57.766 --> 14:59.376
she had to eat it
in the bathroom.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.813
The recoil is gonna put you
through the ceiling, little man.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.946
I don't know why
we're going through
all this trouble.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.687
I had a much faster way
to do this.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.949
We're not cutting
him open, Reese.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.472
This will
still work out.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.126
We just have to adjust
the destruction list.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.954
The way I look at it,
we have to skip

15:12.041 --> 15:13.651
paint-ballooning
the Tai-chi group,

15:13.738 --> 15:16.045
the charity 10K won't get
its phony route markers,

15:16.132 --> 15:17.917
and I'm afraid planting
the porn magazines

15:18.004 --> 15:19.701
in the feminist bookstore
will have to wait
till another time.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.529
It's like you're killing
my children!

15:28.014 --> 15:29.754
-Wait. Wait...
-Shut up, Dewey!

15:29.841 --> 15:31.539
That's not the end
I want to be hearing from!

15:31.626 --> 15:33.410
[gags]

15:33.497 --> 15:34.803
[coughing]

15:36.457 --> 15:37.545
You're taking
his side in this?

15:37.632 --> 15:39.721
I'm not taking
anyone's side.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.244
There are no sides!

15:41.331 --> 15:43.899
I'm just saying look
at it from Francis' side.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.553
He crucified me
in that meeting!

15:45.640 --> 15:46.989
You're right to feel
attacked by these people,

15:47.076 --> 15:48.599
but this is about Francis.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.862
He's building
a new life.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.560
We've got to
go easy on him.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.344
He's only been
sober for one year.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.693
He's a one-year-old.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.434
You're fighting
with an infant!

15:57.521 --> 15:59.654
This infant dragged my name
through the mud

15:59.741 --> 16:02.309
and now wants us
to give him $20,000!

16:02.396 --> 16:04.789
This is an investment in
a business for our son.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.269
What?! He's quit drinking,

16:06.356 --> 16:08.097
and now magically,
he knows how to run a business?!

16:08.184 --> 16:10.360
See? You are still
stuck in this stupid
death struggle

16:10.447 --> 16:12.710
that you have had with
him since he was born!

16:12.797 --> 16:14.974
Francis has changed,
and you have got

16:15.061 --> 16:16.801
to face that fact!

16:16.888 --> 16:18.499
No! Francis has not changed!

16:18.586 --> 16:20.762
He has just changed his tricks
to get what he wants.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.678
This whole day has been about
getting us to sign that loan!

16:23.765 --> 16:26.463
There you go again!
I know for a fact this
is not about the loan!

16:26.550 --> 16:27.812
How? How do you know that?

16:27.899 --> 16:29.597
Because I've already
signed it, okay?

16:29.684 --> 16:31.468
So can we
just move on?

16:31.555 --> 16:35.342
What?!

16:35.429 --> 16:37.997
[shrieking]

16:55.362 --> 16:56.885
Nothing yet.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.278
I wish there was something
I could do.

16:58.365 --> 16:59.975
I feel so helpless.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.586
Just think
good thoughts.

17:05.285 --> 17:08.462
Reese, quick,
the colander!

17:23.999 --> 17:25.782
Where do we start?

17:25.869 --> 17:28.873
I guess you just...
go for it.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.268
-[engine starting]
-[horn honking]

17:32.355 --> 17:34.879
Dewey! He had the
key all along!

17:34.966 --> 17:37.273
No!

17:37.360 --> 17:38.666
What are you doing?

17:38.753 --> 17:40.494
There could be a spare.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.194
I cannot believe you went
behind my back on this!

17:45.281 --> 17:46.978
You think you're going
to get away with this,

17:47.066 --> 17:47.979
you are sadly mistaken!

17:48.067 --> 17:49.329
$20,000, Francis?

17:49.416 --> 17:50.591
How in the world
would you...

17:50.678 --> 17:52.593
What's this?

17:52.680 --> 17:56.118
The loan. If you're not
on board, we won't do it.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.902
What?

17:57.989 --> 18:00.209
I don't want you and Dad
fighting because of us.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.037
This is not how we wanted
to start our business.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.692
Piama and I will
just get the money
from someone else.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.956
But I was...
Really?

18:08.043 --> 18:09.392
Absolutely.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.002
Come on. Let's go get
something to eat.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.265
Oh, that new Thai place

18:12.352 --> 18:13.353
just opened up
around the corner.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.615
Sounds good to me.

18:14.702 --> 18:15.833
Dad, you better get
your jacket.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.878
-It might get cold.
-Ah, okay.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.228
-Francis?
-Yeah, Mom?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.404
Are you sure
you don't want the money?

18:21.491 --> 18:23.493
Mom, I don't want anything
you don't want to give.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.632
-Mom...
-I want you to have the loan.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.329
I was wrong.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.983
You've changed.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.680
Are you serious?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.204
Really, you don't have
to do this.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.207
I know. That's why
I want you to have it.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.774
So that you and Piama
can start your business

18:43.861 --> 18:45.124
with our blessing.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.521
Wow, Mom,
this is huge!

18:51.608 --> 18:53.088
Well, it is a lot of money.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.698
Not the loan-- you.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.135
What?

18:56.222 --> 18:57.266
You actually admitted
you were wrong.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.659
That's the first step.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.051
Are you ready to take
the next one?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.618
What are you talking about?
What step?

19:01.705 --> 19:04.621
The first step to admitting
you're an alcoholic.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.842
I'm not an alcoholic.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.366
Okay, you're not ready.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.238
This is my fault.
They tell us not to do this.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.196
It has to come from you.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.371
Is everybody ready to go?

19:15.458 --> 19:16.807
Francis, I don't drink.

19:16.894 --> 19:17.895
I mean, maybe I have
a glass of champagne

19:17.982 --> 19:19.070
on my birthday...

19:19.158 --> 19:20.333
Every birthday?

19:20.420 --> 19:21.421
What does that
have to do with anything?

19:21.508 --> 19:22.987
I think we should
get going...

19:23.074 --> 19:24.641
Come on, Mom, you have
the classic signs.

19:24.728 --> 19:25.947
Irrational behavior,

19:26.034 --> 19:27.557
not able to control
your emotions.

19:27.644 --> 19:28.950
Everyone else is the problem.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.779
Francis, I do not drink.
I am not an alcoholic.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.085
Mom, you don't have to drink
to be an alcoholic.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.261
Yeah, you do!

19:35.348 --> 19:38.394
Alcoholism.
It's in the name.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.700
I think your mother's
right on this.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.092
No, she's not.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.225
I barely drank,
and I'm an alcoholic.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.488
It's true; I've only
seen him tipsy once.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.621
He gets sick. I can't
even give him cough syrup.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.058
How the hell can
you call yourself an alcoholic

19:50.145 --> 19:51.755
if you don't even drink?

19:51.842 --> 19:53.757
What do you mean?
My life was a wreck!

19:53.844 --> 19:55.411
I had no future, no hope.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.847
I had all the signs.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.284
Except for the alcohol part.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.763
Why do you keep harping
on that?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.374
Why do you have to do that?

20:01.461 --> 20:02.810
You never let me
have anything!

20:02.897 --> 20:03.898
You wouldn't
let me have that bike

20:03.985 --> 20:05.160
or those throwing stars!

20:05.247 --> 20:06.596
Now you won't
let me have alcoholism--

20:06.683 --> 20:08.772
the one thing
I'm doing right in my life!

20:08.859 --> 20:11.862
Unbelievable. If it's not me,
it's alcohol, right?

20:11.949 --> 20:14.517
The problem's
always somewhere else.

20:14.604 --> 20:16.606
Francis, you need to take
a look in the mirror.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.739
Come on, Hal, let's go home.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.784
Wait a minute.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.786
You can't
walk out on me!

20:22.873 --> 20:25.485
This is
your problem, too!

20:26.529 --> 20:28.618
At least you support me,
right, Dad?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.881
You know, I thought I did, son,
but then I realized

20:30.968 --> 20:33.275
I was just doing it
for all the wrong reasons.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.669
I was just trying
to buy your love.

20:39.107 --> 20:42.066
See you on your
real birthday, son.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.430
You know, maybe Mom was right.

20:57.517 --> 21:01.042
I was blaming her
and the alcohol for my problems

21:01.129 --> 21:04.698
when the real problem was
always right in front of me.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.003
Me?!

21:06.090 --> 21:08.397
Yes, you.
Who else could it be?

21:08.484 --> 21:10.138
Why didn't you tell me
I wasn't an alcoholic?

21:10.225 --> 21:11.226
How am I supposed to know?

21:11.313 --> 21:12.749
You seemed messed up to me.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.099
FRANCIS: You made me
look like an idiot!

21:15.186 --> 21:16.275
-PIAMA: That wasn't hard to do.
-FRANCIS: Was that an insult?
[door slams]
