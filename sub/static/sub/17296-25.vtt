Looks like the
tables have turned for you!

00:25.895 --> 00:27.766
Please don't.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.643
Crime alert!

00:36.297 --> 00:37.341
What is it, bro?

00:37.385 --> 00:39.300
Are the villains
doing the rampage?

00:39.343 --> 00:41.650
A natural disaster threatening
thousands of lives?

00:41.693 --> 00:44.261
Or a third option
I can't think of?

00:44.305 --> 00:46.350
Worse than all
of those combined.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.874
- Pirates!
- Pirates?

00:48.918 --> 00:50.137
We love pirates.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.226
You what?

00:52.269 --> 00:53.531
Let's cast off the mizzenmast

00:53.575 --> 00:55.490
and swab the decks
off the port bow, mateys.

00:55.533 --> 00:59.146
I'ma sail them seven seas, yo.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.369
Not those kinds of pirates.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.807
I'm talking
about computer pirates.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.549
You mean robot pirates?

01:11.593 --> 01:14.639
We love robot pirates.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.598
Let us cast off the mizzenmast

01:16.641 --> 01:19.644
and swab the decks
off the port bow, mateys.

01:21.472 --> 01:25.346
Yo, ho, ho. Yo, yo, yo.
Yo, ho, ho. Yo, ho.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.087
Yar 2.0.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.349
Not robot pirates!

01:29.350 --> 01:31.917
I said, computer pirates.

01:31.961 --> 01:34.964
Oh, holds up.
Is you talking about nerds?

01:35.007 --> 01:38.402
Computer pirates aren't nerds.
They're dangerous criminals.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.101
The computer nerds
can be the dangerous?

01:41.144 --> 01:44.104
To intellectual property? Yes.

01:44.147 --> 01:47.672
They illegally obtain music, movies,
games and other forms of entertainment

01:47.716 --> 01:49.587
and distribute them
on the Internet for free,

01:49.631 --> 01:51.937
costing big companies
millions of dollars.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.026
Isn't there someone else
who can handle this?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.289
Of course, the FBI can,

01:55.332 --> 01:57.508
but the problem is so widespread

01:57.552 --> 01:59.206
they can surely use our help.

01:59.249 --> 02:02.339
Unless there's a high seas
adventure, we're not interested.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.514
Come on, guys.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.603
We're going to be cool
good guy hackers

02:05.647 --> 02:07.431
and take down a gang
of computer pirates.

02:07.475 --> 02:11.174
Thereby saving entertainment
companies billions in lost revenue.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.610
Oh, do we have to?

02:12.654 --> 02:15.047
Yes.

02:26.711 --> 02:30.280
So, you started
an old, tiny hair salon?

02:30.324 --> 02:34.241
Yo, give me a perm,
with them tight curl-a-curls.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.199
These are advanced VR helmets

02:36.243 --> 02:39.246
that will transport our
consciousness inside my computer,

02:39.289 --> 02:41.509
where we'll become
our cool hacker avatars,

02:41.552 --> 02:44.816
find those computer pirates,
and take them down.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.383
And make them walk the plank!

02:48.385 --> 02:49.299
No planks!

02:49.343 --> 02:51.432
This is a hacker adventure.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.303
We will report them to the FBI

02:53.347 --> 02:56.785
and they will face
up to $250,000 in fines.

02:56.828 --> 03:00.310
Not to mention a potential
5 year prison sentence.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.443
Eh, that sounds boring.

03:02.486 --> 03:06.273
It only sounds boring because you
don't understand virtual reality.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.317
You just need to...

03:07.361 --> 03:09.537
Free your minds.

03:09.580 --> 03:13.410
Make your choice.

03:13.454 --> 03:17.109
The red jellybeans
or the blue one?

03:17.153 --> 03:18.285
Choose carefully.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.506
Jellybeans!

03:22.550 --> 03:25.335
Hey, hey, hey! You were
supposed to make a choice

03:25.379 --> 03:26.684
between being free thinkers

03:26.728 --> 03:29.470
or staying imprisoned
in your own minds.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.428
We pick jellybeans.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.952
Forget it.
Let's just get started.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.216
Titans, jack in!

03:36.259 --> 03:38.261
- Say what?
- Jack in!

03:38.305 --> 03:41.264
It's computer hacker slang for
plugging our brains into my computer.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.267
Are you sure about this?
Your computer is pretty old, dude.

03:47.488 --> 03:50.534
It'll be fine. Now, jack in!

03:50.578 --> 03:52.362
Sounds kinda creepy
when you say it like that.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.886
I'm not a creep. Jack in!

03:56.540 --> 03:58.977
- Whoa!
- Wow.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.327
Hacker adventure.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.287
Ooh, where are we?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.724
Welcome to my computer.

04:06.768 --> 04:09.466
You saids this would be
an awesome simulation.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, this place is
a real bummer.

04:11.163 --> 04:14.732
Robin, you are
looking the leathery.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.169
This is my awesome
hacker outfit.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.308
I told you hacking was cool.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.353
Hmm.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.224
You guys can look like this too.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.488
You just have to free your minds.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.359
Do we get more jellybeans?

04:32.402 --> 04:34.056
- No.
- Pass.

04:34.099 --> 04:34.970
Fine.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.277
Let me just log us in.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.585
Yo, you ain't supposed to mix up
them numbers and letters like that.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.848
Hackers make
their own cool hacker names

04:43.892 --> 04:46.547
by replacing certain letters
with numbers.

04:46.590 --> 04:49.289
So, your hacker name is...

04:49.332 --> 04:50.638
It's Blaze.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.818
No, it's not.

04:56.861 --> 05:00.517
Are you giggling because Blaze
sounds so cool?

05:00.561 --> 05:03.433
Yes, Robin.
Blaze is the cool name.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.522
Yes, I knew it!

05:05.566 --> 05:09.874
Now, prepare to enter a virtual
world of danger and excitement.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.357
Come with me Titans,

05:14.401 --> 05:17.969
and I'll show you just how
deep the rabbit hole goes.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.884
Free your minds.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.584
Hey, this is just your desktop.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.629
- Isn't it awesome?
- No.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.937
Look! Ooh, ah.

05:28.980 --> 05:33.507
I'm interacting with this virtual environment.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.987
Hey, what's in here?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.860
Bro, why do you have so many
pics with your shirt off?

05:38.903 --> 05:41.515
Those were taken on hot days.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.081
What else you got in here?

05:43.125 --> 05:45.954
Don't make a mess.
I have everything organized.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.740
Oh, snaps!
You got that new game.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.787
Turn that off. It's going
to take up too much memory!

05:52.830 --> 05:55.006
It's cool, bro, I remember this.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.314
- I gots memories for days.
- Computer memory.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.185
Let's get some music
going up in here.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.665
Stop.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.928
- Ooh, clickety clickety.
- Stoppity, stop, stop, stop.

06:03.972 --> 06:07.018
- You're overloading the system.
- It's going...

06:21.337 --> 06:23.252
Whoa! What happened?

06:23.295 --> 06:26.821
You crashed the computer with
your careless memory management.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.562
You said
this would be fun, Robin.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.520
Instead it is the very boring.

06:30.564 --> 06:34.045
Yeah, you should have
just let them FBis do this.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.047
But we haven't even gotten
to the best part.

06:36.091 --> 06:39.007
The Internet.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.097
Time to log on.

06:42.706 --> 06:43.707
Gross.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.800
Welcome to the worldwide web.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.455
This is where we'll have
our awesome hacker battle

06:52.499 --> 06:54.936
with those evil
computer pirates.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.633
We just need to find them.

07:00.115 --> 07:03.684
- What's the hold up?
- Hmm, seems to be a...

07:03.727 --> 07:05.425
Slow Internet connection.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.514
Did you try turning
the modem off for 30 seconds

07:07.557 --> 07:09.690
- and then turning it back on again?
- I can't.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.562
- We're on the neighbor's Wi-Fi.
- Is that not the illegal?

07:12.606 --> 07:14.129
Not if he didn't set up
a password.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
Any second now.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.051
Any second.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.547
Yar, har, har!

07:40.590 --> 07:41.722
Pirates!

07:41.765 --> 07:43.332
What a haul, me hardies!

07:43.375 --> 07:47.510
Music, movies,
productivity software.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.732
The computer pirates are...

07:51.775 --> 07:54.038
- Pirates?
- Let's take 'em down, dude.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
What's the point?

07:55.823 --> 07:57.955
This was supposed to be
a cool hacker adventure,

07:57.999 --> 07:59.696
not a maritime brawl.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.915
Just let the FBI handle them.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.700
Robin, this is a cool
hacker adventure.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.616
You just gots
to free your mind, fool.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.488
Free my mind.

08:10.577 --> 08:14.145
I see it so clearly now.
This is a hacker adventure!

08:14.189 --> 08:16.931
Download swash
buckling software.

08:16.974 --> 08:20.587
- Yar!
- Download pirate voices.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.807
Yar, I'll be knowing
how to talk like a pirate now.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.983
Download pirate ship.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.511
It's time we throw these
scallywags overboard.

08:31.554 --> 08:35.210
Titans, yo, ho, ho!

08:38.735 --> 08:41.782
Time to swab the deck,
me hearty.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.871
Hackers off the stern, Captain!

08:45.046 --> 08:47.875
Protect the cargo
at all costs, me lads!

08:57.798 --> 09:00.670
I'll be sending you
to Davy Jones' Locker.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.805
You'll never stop
computer piracy,

09:04.848 --> 09:07.329
it be a victimless
crime, after all.

09:07.372 --> 09:11.463
Tell that to the companies losing
millions of dollars in revenue.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.293
And the artists who work
day and night

09:15.337 --> 09:18.296
who won't see a penny
off their hard work.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.170
And the consumers forced
to pay exorbitant amounts

09:22.213 --> 09:24.651
for office
productivity software.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.832
We did it.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.268
You know what?
You were right, dude.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.618
This was a cool,
hacker adventure.

09:35.662 --> 09:36.793
You really think so?

09:36.837 --> 09:39.753
Indeed. Thank you
for showing us the way,

09:39.796 --> 09:41.145
Blaze.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.712
Blaze.

09:45.715 --> 09:49.589
Yo, them pirates got some good
stuffs up in here. Check it.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.855
I guess it would be okay
to browse around.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.379
Check out all this music.
This is my jam!

09:59.511 --> 10:03.124
Oh, and one could process many
of the words with this software.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.909
The Pretty, Pretty Pegasusmovie!

10:08.477 --> 10:11.436
Whoa, who are those cool dudes?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.525
It's the FBI.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.354
You computer pirates
make me sick.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.313
Oh, no. We're not...

10:18.356 --> 10:21.359
You're under arrest for
possession of stolen software.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.317
Run!
