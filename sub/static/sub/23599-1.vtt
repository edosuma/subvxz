Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:30.989 --> 02:32.791
Sayonara, motherfucker!

02:51.110 --> 02:52.909
<i>We're going live.
Can you check on it?</i>

02:54.713 --> 02:56.613
Ten cars down, two to go.

02:56.615 --> 02:58.149
These drivers are crazy.

02:58.151 --> 03:00.251
I still don't understand
why they're so willing to die.

03:00.253 --> 03:03.087
Because everyone
wants to be king of the hill.

03:03.089 --> 03:04.888
Is the race streaming
on the dark Web?

03:04.890 --> 03:07.358
Yes, Warden,
it's online in real time

03:07.360 --> 03:10.394
on Freenet, I2P, and Tor.

03:10.396 --> 03:12.329
And there's no way to trace
the ISP and shut 'em down

03:12.331 --> 03:13.364
with a Web-based attack?

03:13.366 --> 03:17.334
If I was the NSA and had
a couple of months, maybe.

03:17.336 --> 03:20.104
These guys are
a legitimate cyber militia.

03:20.106 --> 03:24.308
The encryption is first-rate.
It's bouncing every ten seconds.

03:24.310 --> 03:25.708
Then kill their power.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.211
We don't supply their power.

03:27.213 --> 03:28.647
They're on their own
jerry-rigged grid.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.621
Bitch-up and take out
this motherfucker!

03:44.297 --> 03:45.298
Yeah, baby!

03:50.902 --> 03:53.206
Fuck you, Frank!

04:00.846 --> 04:02.946
Any word from the OTB site?

04:02.948 --> 04:05.216
On-site and online
wagering are up.

04:05.218 --> 04:07.218
They're writing
a lot of betting slips.

04:07.220 --> 04:10.221
The house is banking cash on the
secondary racers and the parlays,

04:10.223 --> 04:11.754
and we're raking in some vig.

04:11.756 --> 04:13.857
If Frankenstein wins,
there's a payout.

04:13.859 --> 04:16.226
Death Race is illegal
and bigger than ever.

04:17.762 --> 04:19.363
Thanks to our resident
crazy man Frank.

04:19.365 --> 04:21.332
Aw, fuck Frankenstein.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.967
You're the one who resurrected
Death Race from the dead.

04:23.969 --> 04:26.069
I just figured out how to decode
the satellite signals

04:26.071 --> 04:27.737
and stream it
on the dark Web.

04:27.739 --> 04:30.241
Frankenstein's been born again
thanks to us.

04:30.243 --> 04:33.109
Well, if he wins tonight,
it'll be his seventh straight.

04:33.111 --> 04:35.479
Oh, our contact on the outside
says our margins are dropping

04:35.481 --> 04:37.747
'cause nobody's taking
the other side of the bet.

04:37.749 --> 04:39.816
We're losing a lot of money
on Frankenstein.

04:39.818 --> 04:41.718
We need to spice things up.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.954
The parlays
are paying off, but...

04:44.257 --> 04:46.225
We need a challenger.

04:53.098 --> 04:55.466
SWAT is en route,
T-minus five minutes.

04:55.468 --> 04:58.302
Let's shut Frankenstein
and Death Race down

04:58.304 --> 04:59.769
once and for all.

05:08.414 --> 05:10.514
We've got some action
from the outside.

05:10.516 --> 05:12.216
You wanted spice.

05:12.218 --> 05:13.386
Say hello to SWAT.

05:21.793 --> 05:23.061
Let's trade some paint.

05:24.430 --> 05:26.064
Suck my dick, Frankie!

05:27.233 --> 05:29.533
Suck my dick too, Frankie!

05:29.535 --> 05:31.136
Push them into the fucking wall!

05:35.374 --> 05:36.741
Do it, baby!

05:41.947 --> 05:44.149
Motherfucker!

05:45.784 --> 05:49.286
Whoo!

05:49.288 --> 05:50.423
Get off the wall!
Got it!

05:53.292 --> 05:55.160
Take this motherfucker out!

05:57.496 --> 05:59.432
I picked the wrong driver!

06:47.946 --> 06:49.178
Full house.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.516
Eights over aces.

07:01.026 --> 07:02.426
Oh, nice.

07:02.428 --> 07:03.993
Nines over jacks.

07:11.136 --> 07:13.004
I'd like a shot at getting
my money back.

07:18.043 --> 07:20.245
Why don't I come to your place
later tonight?

07:25.484 --> 07:27.986
Maybe we can shuffle
another deck of cards.

07:30.155 --> 07:31.390
<i>Está bien.</i>

07:34.660 --> 07:38.395
Hey, jefe, I've got a player,
wants to play some heavy action.

07:38.397 --> 07:41.064
On SWAT versus Frankenstein.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.468
- SWAT?
- SWAT.

07:46.639 --> 07:48.271
Where's he gonna
play his money?

07:48.273 --> 07:50.940
SWAT for 100,000.
Even odds.

07:50.942 --> 07:54.145
It's my book.
I'll set the odds.

07:55.481 --> 07:57.080
Three to one.

07:57.082 --> 07:59.048
And if he gives you
any pushback,

07:59.050 --> 08:02.386
tell him the Mexican Jew said
go to hell and take his mom.

08:02.388 --> 08:05.456
I hope they got
that last shipment of guns.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.358
Now make me some money, Frank.

08:34.152 --> 08:36.154
Carley!

08:44.963 --> 08:51.234
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

08:51.236 --> 08:57.441
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

09:07.720 --> 09:09.120
Go!

09:53.699 --> 09:55.097
Cover left.

09:57.268 --> 09:58.569
Clear, sector one.

09:58.571 --> 10:00.004
Breach team, move up.

10:04.242 --> 10:06.077
Tango, direct front. Eight in.

10:10.081 --> 10:11.282
Go, go, go!

10:11.784 --> 10:13.084
Take this.

10:18.757 --> 10:21.157
Hold up!

10:21.159 --> 10:22.728
Move, move, move!
Back it up! Go, go!

10:23.562 --> 10:24.695
We're all clear.

10:24.697 --> 10:26.262
Tell me we got cameras in there.

10:26.264 --> 10:29.098
Yeah. We've got
cameras everywhere.

10:32.303 --> 10:33.271
Go left.

10:35.273 --> 10:36.174
Go left, clear.

10:41.145 --> 10:42.313
Go right.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.348
Go right, clear.

10:54.459 --> 10:55.360
Two tango down!

11:02.735 --> 11:05.301
<i>Sector two, report.</i>

11:05.303 --> 11:06.672
Copy that, one minute.

11:08.874 --> 11:10.609
Spread out. Move.

11:11.476 --> 11:12.743
Got eyes on nothing.

11:12.745 --> 11:14.212
I got eyes.

11:18.884 --> 11:20.385
Yeah, motherfuckers, let's go!

13:27.913 --> 13:28.747
Get some, Frank!

13:48.834 --> 13:51.367
Send me the best
you've got, Warden.

13:51.369 --> 13:52.769
I'll send them
back to you skinned,

13:52.771 --> 13:54.637
<i>gutted and quartered.</i>

13:54.639 --> 13:58.041
<i>You may be in charge out there,
but this is my city.</i>

13:58.043 --> 13:59.477
<i>This is The Sprawl!</i>

14:10.588 --> 14:13.422
Come around that first corner.

14:16.729 --> 14:19.328
- Hello?
- This isn't gonna play well in the <i>Washington Post</i> tomorrow.

14:19.330 --> 14:20.964
I know, Mr. Valentine.

14:20.966 --> 14:22.698
Well, then you know
I've got Congress up my ass

14:22.700 --> 14:24.935
about The Sprawl
and its morality.

14:24.937 --> 14:26.770
<i>Frankenstein is out of control.</i>

14:26.772 --> 14:28.772
His legion is growing.

14:28.774 --> 14:30.907
The government is gonna
take back my prison

14:30.909 --> 14:34.343
<i>unless we shut down Frankenstein
and shut him down now.</i>

14:34.345 --> 14:36.012
When I took over
Weyland International,

14:36.014 --> 14:39.615
I was tasked with a very
specific directive.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.451
Clean up The Sprawl
and put an end to Frankenstein.

14:42.453 --> 14:44.921
More importantly, Death Race.

14:44.923 --> 14:48.859
<i>Our contract's up in five years, and we've got
a lot invested in that human garbage dump.</i>

14:48.861 --> 14:51.995
So when I get pulled into a
congressional oversight committee,

14:51.997 --> 14:55.531
what should I say to the 435
members of the House, huh?

14:55.533 --> 14:57.466
Well, tell them
that we're doing our best, but...

14:57.468 --> 15:00.336
But what? We can't control a
bunch of sociopathic gearheads?

15:00.338 --> 15:03.572
And Frankenstein's even more legendary
now that Death Race is illegal?

15:03.574 --> 15:06.009
I can handle
Frankenstein, sir.

15:06.011 --> 15:09.545
Really? 'Cause from where I sit,
Frankenstein's making you look like a chump!

15:09.547 --> 15:12.515
He's gathering steam and mounting
what adds up to a small army.

15:12.517 --> 15:14.285
You can't shut him down
from the outside.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.486
He's just a mask.

15:17.488 --> 15:19.290
Anybody can wear the mask.

15:20.793 --> 15:22.558
His disciples, inside and out,

15:22.560 --> 15:24.861
need to see him suffer
a humiliating defeat.

15:24.863 --> 15:27.730
He needs to die during
Death Race and die bloody.

15:27.732 --> 15:29.665
He loses Death Race,
he loses his power.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.600
That's how you
take back our prison.

15:31.602 --> 15:33.404
Make it happen or I will!

15:40.012 --> 15:44.080
What I'm about to feed you
is going to taste bitter.

15:44.082 --> 15:48.517
You have found yourselves
in a no-win situation.

15:48.519 --> 15:52.788
There are two options:
die or survive.

15:52.790 --> 15:55.524
You will not be given clothes.

15:55.526 --> 15:57.426
What you're wearing
is what you'll wear.

15:57.428 --> 16:00.462
You will not be given
a place to sleep.

16:00.464 --> 16:03.099
You will not be given jack shit,

16:03.101 --> 16:06.502
except maybe a bullet
in the brain!

16:06.504 --> 16:08.905
If you are lucky.

16:08.907 --> 16:13.542
Rest assured, there are
no virgins within these walls,

16:13.544 --> 16:17.049
because life
has fucked you all.

16:18.083 --> 16:22.085
The Sprawl is 88,000 acres

16:22.087 --> 16:25.090
of bad shit about to happen.

16:26.024 --> 16:27.656
The Containment Zone

16:27.658 --> 16:33.096
warehouses 420,000 of the worst
of the worst offenders.

16:33.098 --> 16:36.667
Best advice: learn how to run.

16:37.468 --> 16:38.969
Learn how to fight!

16:38.971 --> 16:41.737
Stop eye-fucking me, asshole.

16:41.739 --> 16:45.008
Uncle Sam has decided
to provide you

16:45.010 --> 16:48.178
with one role
of silver coins.

16:48.180 --> 16:52.781
This will be your currency
inside the walls.

16:52.783 --> 16:54.617
That's the hotwash.

16:54.619 --> 16:56.819
Now, get yourselves ready,

16:56.821 --> 16:59.390
we're approaching
D-Z Alpha Bravo.

17:11.736 --> 17:13.936
All right, convicts, go, go!

17:13.939 --> 17:16.840
Make the world a better place.
Get the fuck out of here!

17:19.710 --> 17:21.577
How do I get in Death Race?

17:21.579 --> 17:24.646
Find Baltimore Bob. If you got
what it takes, he'll get you in.

17:24.648 --> 17:27.217
Move! Get off my bird now!

17:27.219 --> 17:30.454
Let me off. Let's go!
Fuck you staring at?

17:30.989 --> 17:32.055
Go!

18:08.659 --> 18:10.060
Bad news.

18:10.062 --> 18:12.197
Who wants to play?
Motherfucker.

18:13.198 --> 18:14.264
Come here!

18:18.869 --> 18:20.669
Where's that silver?
Get the fuck on the ground.

18:20.671 --> 18:22.473
I don't like this shit.

18:24.775 --> 18:26.742
Shut your fucking mouth!

18:26.744 --> 18:28.080
Quit eyeballing me!

18:29.780 --> 18:31.582
Well, ain't this a rainbow
of fucking ugly?

18:33.584 --> 18:36.088
You folks lost?
We're good.

18:37.655 --> 18:38.923
You look lost.

18:40.092 --> 18:41.291
Nah, we're good, thanks.

18:41.293 --> 18:42.660
You're good?

18:47.665 --> 18:49.232
That's good.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.167
Now give me
your fucking silver.

18:51.169 --> 18:52.536
Why would we do that?

18:54.306 --> 18:55.971
It's a landing tax.

18:55.973 --> 18:57.575
Why don't you just shoot us
and take it?

19:04.182 --> 19:07.017
Maybe I don't want
to waste my bullets

19:07.019 --> 19:08.953
on a gutter bitch
like you.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.221
Huh?

19:11.223 --> 19:13.858
Mmm.
Mmm.

19:15.127 --> 19:17.260
You're a real sweet talker,
ain't you?

19:17.262 --> 19:19.630
Ah, thanks, I try.

19:21.066 --> 19:22.633
I don't think
you have any bullets.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.101
In fact,

19:25.103 --> 19:26.871
I think you're shooting blanks.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.976
Okay?

19:33.978 --> 19:35.711
You folks want to play
the hard way?

19:35.713 --> 19:37.715
Up against
the fucking truck!

20:18.223 --> 20:19.291
Is this what you wanted?

20:32.002 --> 20:34.071
I got this bad feeling
I owe you, pretty boy.

20:35.072 --> 20:35.973
We're square.

21:24.054 --> 21:25.823
You the one
that gave the cops a beating?

21:27.791 --> 21:28.957
I don't want any trouble.

21:28.959 --> 21:30.493
Oh, you don't?

21:30.495 --> 21:33.128
'Cause if you tuned up the cops,
you're gonna have some.

21:33.130 --> 21:34.999
I'm just looking
for Baltimore Bob.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.272
Then jump in, cowboy.

21:41.339 --> 21:42.940

23:21.939 --> 23:25.209
If I had a dick, here's where
I'd tell your ass to suck it.

23:27.111 --> 23:30.178
So your story
is that one unarmed man

23:30.180 --> 23:32.282
took out you and your gang

23:32.284 --> 23:34.350
and boosted
my landing tax?

23:34.352 --> 23:36.286
I'm sorry, Frank,
I'll do better next time.

23:36.288 --> 23:39.389
There's no next times
in The Sprawl. You know this.

23:39.391 --> 23:41.189
You got sent here
for killing cops,

23:41.191 --> 23:43.058
and you can't
handle one con?

23:43.060 --> 23:45.927
Like I said, I'm sorry, Frank.
I'll do better next time.

23:45.929 --> 23:47.164
He just got lucky.

23:49.401 --> 23:51.166
Every piece of silver
you collect

23:51.168 --> 23:53.135
goes right back
to The Sprawl.

23:53.137 --> 23:56.240
When my landing tax goes
uncollected, the city suffers.

24:01.479 --> 24:03.080
Do you like to suffer?

24:04.281 --> 24:05.883
I don't like to suffer, Frank.

Course, he is.

24:32.510 --> 24:34.945
Connor Gibson, meet Jane.

24:36.481 --> 24:37.415
It's good
to meet you, Jane.

24:38.450 --> 24:41.049
He's all yours, <i>chica.</i>

24:41.051 --> 24:43.153
I'ma go dance on the pole.
Scoot over, girl!

24:45.357 --> 24:48.959
So... where'd you come in from?

24:49.527 --> 24:50.959
Long Beach.

24:50.961 --> 24:51.962
What are you in for?

24:53.431 --> 24:55.063
Does it matter?

24:55.065 --> 24:56.331
It does to me.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.967

One of my tax collectors told me
you attacked him then robbed him.

26:06.170 --> 26:08.604
That's not exactly
how it went down.

26:08.606 --> 26:10.440
Enlighten me, convict.

26:10.442 --> 26:12.107
Kill him, Frank!

26:12.109 --> 26:14.142
Your boy and his pals
tried to jump me.

26:14.144 --> 26:15.745
Yet you're the one
who walked away.

26:15.747 --> 26:17.580
I didn't say they
were any good at it.

26:17.582 --> 26:19.247
Let me whack him, Frank.

26:19.249 --> 26:20.783
Ain't nothing
but a couple drops of jizz

26:20.785 --> 26:23.020
sprouted from a shit-filled
crack in the sidewalk.

26:25.389 --> 26:27.057
Have we met before?

26:29.159 --> 26:31.527
I don't think so.
I just got here.

26:31.529 --> 26:33.030
And if we had,
I wouldn't know.

26:34.131 --> 26:35.330
You're hiding behind a mask.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.432
This is my city.

26:37.434 --> 26:39.569
No one speaks to me like that.

26:39.571 --> 26:40.705
Kill that motherfucker!

26:42.172 --> 26:43.506
Listen, you accused me
of stealing,

26:43.508 --> 26:46.043
and I didn't steal anything,
I defended myself.

26:47.745 --> 26:50.047
It's not my fault your boys weren't
up to the fight they picked.

26:53.383 --> 26:54.552
Watch your back, convict.

27:13.270 --> 27:16.006
You're definitely
not from Long Beach.

27:19.443 --> 27:23.080
You make it a habit to punch
above your weight, convict?

27:26.651 --> 27:29.451
Word is,
you're looking for me.

27:29.453 --> 27:30.354
Baltimore Bob?

27:36.093 --> 27:38.460
Your balls must be
made out of titanium.

27:40.798 --> 27:43.233
I've never seen anyone
talk to Frank like that.

27:47.805 --> 27:48.740
You drive?

27:51.609 --> 27:53.776
Yeah, I drive.

27:53.778 --> 27:56.478
So what are you
in here for, Bob?

27:56.480 --> 27:58.515
Let's just say
I help people transition.

27:59.617 --> 28:01.784
Press called me "Dr. Kill."

28:01.786 --> 28:04.386
I was an oncologist.
Yeah, I read about you.

28:04.388 --> 28:06.789
You euthanized
over 400 dying people.

28:06.791 --> 28:10.191
I had 432, and not
all of them were dying.

28:10.193 --> 28:12.160
Some were living
inconsequential lives,

28:12.162 --> 28:13.729
and as such,
they were already dead.

28:16.734 --> 28:17.635
Come on, come on!

28:18.803 --> 28:20.435
Get the truck!

28:28.478 --> 28:31.446
This food is property
of Frankenstein!

28:31.448 --> 28:32.447
What the hell are they doing?

28:32.449 --> 28:34.850
Feeding time.
Disciples of Frank.

28:34.852 --> 28:37.787
They hijack the food shipment
and control the supply.

28:37.789 --> 28:40.623
If you keep the populace hungry,
they're easier to control.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.457
Where do all the weapons
and cars come from?

28:42.459 --> 28:43.659
Handmade, homemade.

28:43.661 --> 28:45.460
We lick the bottom of the pot

28:45.462 --> 28:47.395
and refurbish
whatever sticks to our tongues.

28:47.397 --> 28:49.632
And we got a benefactor
on the outside.

28:59.911 --> 29:03.445
Step away from the vehicle,
you motherfucker!

29:05.683 --> 29:08.918
Die, motherfucker!

29:08.920 --> 29:11.754
Fuck you! Nazi fuck.

29:11.756 --> 29:13.423
What you got?
Let's get out of here.

29:50.962 --> 29:52.529
You're the one
everybody's talking about?

29:54.297 --> 29:55.698
News travels fast, huh?

29:55.700 --> 29:57.298
Small town, really.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.602
226,000 to be exact.

30:00.604 --> 30:02.872
We have about
19,000 deaths a year

30:02.874 --> 30:04.508
and 22,000
come over the wall.

30:05.843 --> 30:08.443
Sorry. I'm doing it again.

30:08.445 --> 30:11.214
Connor Gibson, meet Lists.

30:15.787 --> 30:17.687
So what am I
watching here?

30:17.689 --> 30:20.790
It's where non-racers
compete for a spot in Death Race.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.257
And how do you get a spot?

30:22.259 --> 30:23.527
You have to win
the Death Match.

30:25.529 --> 30:28.630
Let this Death Match begin!

30:32.469 --> 30:36.504
Our first contestant is all the
way from New York City, New York.

30:36.506 --> 30:38.440
She's a killer and a thief,

30:38.442 --> 30:41.342
and one sexy
little piece of ass!

30:41.344 --> 30:45.981
Give it up for Gipsy Rose!

30:52.556 --> 30:55.490
Next up, born in the tall cotton

30:55.492 --> 30:58.027
and chicken droppings
of Oxford, Mississippi,

30:58.029 --> 31:00.062
we have a psychotic wack job...
Who's the girl?

31:00.064 --> 31:01.496
Frank's main squeeze.

31:01.498 --> 31:03.733
Your standard, garden-variety
pleasure model.

31:03.735 --> 31:07.002
Carley J'adore.
It's her stage name.

31:07.004 --> 31:10.472
She was charged with 17 counts
of human trafficking,

31:10.474 --> 31:14.409
eight counts prostitution, and another
five counts of false imprisonment.

31:14.411 --> 31:15.911
She's an ex-cheerleader.

31:15.913 --> 31:17.012
Ex-porn star.

31:17.014 --> 31:18.713
Exactly.

31:18.715 --> 31:20.715
Never did a day's work vertical.

31:31.428 --> 31:34.029
On your marks.
Get set.

31:34.031 --> 31:35.465
And die!

32:22.814 --> 32:25.014
Kill! Kill! Kill!

32:34.959 --> 32:36.859
I can't hear you!

32:36.861 --> 32:38.328
Yeah!

32:51.474 --> 32:52.442
Oh, fuck!

33:06.756 --> 33:08.658
Yeah! Yeah!

33:29.546 --> 33:32.449
Shut your fucking mouth!

33:36.519 --> 33:37.821
Yeah!

35:10.680 --> 35:11.781
Yeah!

35:31.935 --> 35:33.701
Yeah!

35:33.703 --> 35:34.871
Yeah!

36:12.809 --> 36:16.746
Don't pick a fight with Godzilla 'cause
you think you know how to throw a punch.

36:18.615 --> 36:19.814
Sleep on it.

36:19.816 --> 36:22.119
You still want Death Race
tomorrow...

36:24.221 --> 36:25.989
we'll talk.

36:38.302 --> 36:39.903
Hey, Long Beach.

36:42.306 --> 36:44.073
Got a bottle.

36:44.075 --> 36:45.742
Could use some company.

36:48.279 --> 36:50.281
- It's nice in here.
- Thanks.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.917
Go ahead and ask.

36:55.919 --> 36:57.386
Everybody always asks.

36:57.388 --> 37:00.623
It's kind of like the "What's
your star sign?" line in here.

37:04.195 --> 37:05.329
I'm guilty.

37:07.298 --> 37:08.896
I wasn't gonna ask.

37:08.898 --> 37:11.732
Yeah, but you would have
found out anyway.

37:11.734 --> 37:13.069
There's no secrets here
in The Sprawl.

37:17.841 --> 37:21.176
I married
a really great guy

37:21.178 --> 37:24.348
who turned out to be
not such a great guy.

37:28.385 --> 37:29.919
He beat me up
a couple of times.

37:31.355 --> 37:35.357
I forgave him,
the market crashed,

37:35.359 --> 37:37.758
he lost his job,

37:37.760 --> 37:39.163
smacked me around
a bit more.

37:41.731 --> 37:43.234
I forgave him again.

37:45.935 --> 37:47.338
And then one day...

37:50.006 --> 37:51.908
I didn't forgive him.

37:53.210 --> 37:54.911
And I shot him nine times.

37:58.047 --> 37:59.949
You know my one regret though?

38:05.356 --> 38:07.090
Is I didn't shoot
the bastard 10.

38:10.194 --> 38:10.927
So...

38:12.429 --> 38:14.864
you still wanna
knock boots with me?

38:17.201 --> 38:18.269
Never said I did.

38:22.373 --> 38:24.406
Okay.

38:24.408 --> 38:28.011
Well, wasn't really
up for the taking anyway.

38:30.214 --> 38:32.214
I just needed somebody
to finish this bottle with,

38:32.216 --> 38:34.385
and you're...

38:37.086 --> 38:41.425
some mysterious guy
from Long Beach, right?

38:43.327 --> 38:44.961
Get some sleep.

38:47.498 --> 38:49.233
Couch is yours
if you want it.

39:04.215 --> 39:06.080
Welcome to the greenhouse.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.950
This is Baltimore Bob's
one-of-a-kind creation.

39:08.952 --> 39:11.286
Inspired by the Chinese
solar greenhouse designs

39:11.288 --> 39:12.887
with CO2 enrichment.

39:12.889 --> 39:17.191
Pesticide-free
and totally 100% organic.

39:17.193 --> 39:20.562
This is where
we make the ethanol.

39:20.564 --> 39:22.964
And Bob is constantly
tinkering with the recipe

39:22.966 --> 39:25.367
to deliver a high-octane brew.

39:25.369 --> 39:30.171
It's got 20 times more kick than the
watered-down petrol from outside the wall.

39:30.173 --> 39:33.275
He's like the OPEC
of The Sprawl.

39:33.277 --> 39:35.044
And he's not
in Frank's pocket?

39:36.413 --> 39:38.247
They have an arrangement.

39:38.249 --> 39:42.049
He provides fuel, and Frank
reciprocates with, um,

39:42.051 --> 39:45.152
protection and
a few other perks.

39:45.154 --> 39:47.458
We eat a little bit better
than the rest.

39:51.362 --> 39:53.428
Gonna need another plate there.

39:53.430 --> 39:55.162
It's all bent to shit.

39:55.164 --> 39:57.231
Yeah, we're gonna
replace the whole coupling.

39:57.233 --> 39:58.335
Throw it on the rack.

40:01.372 --> 40:03.137
We got
some spare cast-iron...

40:05.208 --> 40:07.378
Red, you installing
that catalytic converter yet?

40:08.612 --> 40:09.977
They gotta rebuild it.

40:09.979 --> 40:12.614
- You slept on it?
- I did.

40:12.616 --> 40:15.952
Let's say you
have the skills.

40:20.491 --> 40:24.125
Death Race is
for sociopathic killers.

40:24.127 --> 40:25.895
You gotta have
gravel in your guts.

40:27.263 --> 40:29.930
You have to live
for the smell of motor oil

40:29.932 --> 40:31.433
and high-octane fuel.

40:31.435 --> 40:34.035
You gotta love the sound
of rubber on asphalt

40:34.037 --> 40:36.003
and the taste of blood
in your mouth.

40:36.005 --> 40:37.872
And when you go to sleep
at night,

40:37.874 --> 40:41.042
I mean
that deep REM sleep,

40:41.044 --> 40:44.579
the sound of bullets whizzing past
your head should give you comfort.

40:44.581 --> 40:48.519
So, Mr. Strong and Silent...

40:50.521 --> 40:51.522
you made of that stuff?

40:53.357 --> 40:55.890
If I'm not,
then I die, right?

40:59.262 --> 41:00.895
So you want a shot.

41:06.470 --> 41:08.204
I'll get you a shot.

41:09.939 --> 41:11.540
Tonight.

41:11.542 --> 41:12.543
Death Pit.

41:15.244 --> 41:17.280
Put it over there
with the rest of it.

41:21.652 --> 41:23.152
Be ready to fight.

41:36.332 --> 41:38.165
<i>Welcome to the Death Pit,</i>

41:38.167 --> 41:39.934
<i>you degenerate convicts.</i>

41:39.936 --> 41:44.506
<i>Tonight's final Death Match promises
to be the bloodiest one yet.</i>

41:44.508 --> 41:50.581
<i>The carnage is about to begin, so take your
seats and get ready for the wildest ride yet.</i>

42:09.733 --> 42:11.132
Hello?

42:11.134 --> 42:12.266
Hi, old friend.

42:12.268 --> 42:14.034
Lists, my buddy.
What you got for me?

42:14.036 --> 42:16.070
There's a new guy.

42:16.072 --> 42:17.406
This is his first Death Match,

42:17.408 --> 42:19.508
but Baltimore Bob
says he can fight.

42:19.510 --> 42:21.610
- Could be a challenger.
- What's his story?

42:21.612 --> 42:25.447
Connor Gibson,
in for felony whatever.

42:25.449 --> 42:27.348
Two counts, six counts,
who's counting?

42:27.350 --> 42:28.750
He's in here
with the rest of us.

42:28.752 --> 42:30.652
I wish I had a few more
bullet points for you,

42:30.654 --> 42:32.721
but he's a question mark.

42:32.723 --> 42:36.357
Why don't you send me the link,
and I'll, uh, check him out.

42:36.359 --> 42:38.593
Uh, wait, um, before you go.

42:38.595 --> 42:42.129
We're running short on spare
parts, bulk ammo, CAT-5 cable.

42:42.131 --> 42:43.532
Could you hook me up?

42:43.534 --> 42:45.099
It'll be in
on the next shipment.

42:45.101 --> 42:46.300
Adios, amigo.

42:46.302 --> 42:50.037
Okay, let's see
what this kid's made of.

42:51.475 --> 42:52.674
Warden, check it out.

42:52.676 --> 42:54.676
What do you have?

42:54.678 --> 42:57.378
They're transmitting
a telecast from the Death Pit.

42:57.380 --> 42:58.981
It's the final Death Match.

43:12.128 --> 43:14.130
Welcome to the final
Death Match.

43:15.532 --> 43:16.966
This one's simple easy.

43:19.068 --> 43:20.604
It's called
Capture the Keys.

43:21.605 --> 43:23.137
Here's the rules.

43:23.139 --> 43:27.678
We're not here to see
some MMA submission bullshit.

43:29.145 --> 43:32.148
We're here
to see bone-blasting,

43:33.416 --> 43:36.485
spine-shattering fun.

43:40.557 --> 43:42.291
It's about kill.

43:45.729 --> 43:50.599
It's about blood and bone.

43:50.601 --> 43:54.268
- Aw, man, somebody gonna get a citation!
- Yeah!

43:54.270 --> 43:57.639
We're not here to see
some fucking pussy tap out.

43:57.641 --> 44:01.843
The one person
who gets that set of keys

44:01.845 --> 44:06.515
and sticks it in the ignition
of that car,

44:06.517 --> 44:09.416
wins the last spot
in Death Race.

44:09.418 --> 44:12.288
Yeah!

44:12.823 --> 44:14.591
Adios, suckers.

44:15.424 --> 44:16.558
Peace out.

45:31.768 --> 45:33.670
Somebody call the police?

46:18.749 --> 46:20.614
<i>¡Perro grande!</i>

46:20.616 --> 46:22.717
There's our challenger.

46:22.719 --> 46:23.918
You can't teach that.

46:37.633 --> 46:38.967
Yeah!
Slash that motherfucker!

47:04.560 --> 47:05.896
Yeah!

47:39.562 --> 47:41.497
That pretty boy can punch.

47:42.933 --> 47:45.900
<i>Ja,</i> but can he drive?

47:45.902 --> 47:49.971
Who cares? I want to know
if he fucks like he fights.

47:49.973 --> 47:51.808
RIP that motherfucker!

48:00.984 --> 48:03.954
Yeah!

48:36.619 --> 48:37.854
Ah, fuck.

48:44.127 --> 48:47.796
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for the Butcher.

48:47.798 --> 48:52.133
This mountain of a man has a
bellyful of killing under his belt,

48:52.135 --> 48:56.370
having chalked up 67 body bags
on the kill board.

48:56.372 --> 48:58.639
Submission is not his thing.

48:58.641 --> 49:00.607
Good luck out there, Connor.

49:00.609 --> 49:03.978
You've got the keys.
Do you have the balls?

49:06.615 --> 49:10.118
Side bet, this pretty boy
doesn't last a minute.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.621
I'll take
that action, <i>mi hijita.</i>

49:18.694 --> 49:19.595
Oh!

50:19.488 --> 50:20.389
Ha!

50:52.022 --> 50:53.156
Oh!

51:08.171 --> 51:11.772
Down goes Frazier! Ba-da!

51:11.774 --> 51:14.574
Shit.
Unbelievable.

51:14.576 --> 51:16.745
Hot dog! Made me feel
young again. Shit.

51:45.275 --> 51:47.908
I got something for you,
Frankie-stein.

51:47.910 --> 51:50.311
Got something for you, baby.

51:55.918 --> 51:57.519
Bring the winner by for a talk.

51:58.654 --> 51:59.955
With pleasure.

52:04.893 --> 52:06.662
That's a bad motherfucker.

52:08.597 --> 52:11.201
Wanna pay now, or shall I,
uh, run up a tab?

52:14.104 --> 52:15.771
I'll pay now.
Mmm.

52:53.176 --> 52:55.010
Frank thought you might
want a fresh shirt.

52:58.114 --> 53:00.150
I thought you
might want me.

53:02.385 --> 53:03.719
I'm not into porn stars.

53:12.228 --> 53:14.097
You can't pass this up.

53:19.635 --> 53:20.736
I can.

53:28.411 --> 53:30.746
He might have something
to say about that.

53:48.897 --> 53:52.335
If you think you can make a go of it
against Frankenstein, you're wrong.

53:54.104 --> 53:57.173
I can barely handle him, and I'm
three times the man you are.

54:07.883 --> 54:08.917
Pussy.

54:13.423 --> 54:16.056
Was Carley hospitable?

54:16.058 --> 54:17.227
Something like that.

54:18.927 --> 54:20.696
You've impressed me, twice.

54:21.730 --> 54:24.097
That's not easily done.

54:24.099 --> 54:26.336
What are your first impressions
of The Sprawl?

54:27.270 --> 54:28.402
Anarchy.

54:28.404 --> 54:30.240
Any more than
the outside world?

54:31.940 --> 54:33.075
I think so.

54:40.082 --> 54:42.851
Do you think you can handle
being king of this mountain?

54:46.054 --> 54:47.122
I'm just here to race.

54:48.358 --> 54:50.090
Mmm.

54:50.092 --> 54:52.792
Yes, but if you win,
then what?

54:52.794 --> 54:54.961
Are you ready to lead?

54:54.963 --> 54:56.098
To make hard decisions?

54:59.735 --> 55:02.971
The Sprawl is self-sustaining,
but it wasn't always this way.

55:04.940 --> 55:08.242
When I arrived,
it was a wasteland.

55:08.244 --> 55:10.311
The Weyland corporation
promoted The Sprawl

55:10.313 --> 55:12.380
as an alternative
to regular prison.

55:12.382 --> 55:14.116
That was a lie.

55:15.485 --> 55:17.285
The Sprawl was created

55:17.287 --> 55:19.054
as an alternative
to the death penalty.

55:20.256 --> 55:21.455
They throw us cheese

55:21.457 --> 55:24.458
and expect us to act like rats.

55:24.460 --> 55:26.396
They didn't expect us to evolve.

55:28.431 --> 55:31.401
But we are and we will.

55:32.535 --> 55:36.437
I keep this place
from anarchy.

55:36.439 --> 55:38.272
What does this have to do
with a street race?

55:38.274 --> 55:40.709
It's not just a street race.

55:42.110 --> 55:43.745
It is who we are.

55:45.147 --> 55:47.250
Who are you, Connor Gibson?

55:49.519 --> 55:51.319
Nobody special.

55:51.321 --> 55:56.056
All that could change if you win
Death Race, if you defeat me.

55:56.058 --> 55:59.793
Why would you be willing to risk
losing all this power?

55:59.795 --> 56:03.431
Death Race gives anyone
the opportunity to become king.

56:03.433 --> 56:06.034
Without that to inspire,
we're nothing.

56:07.270 --> 56:08.802
If you win,

56:08.804 --> 56:10.340
what would be
your first act as king?

56:12.174 --> 56:15.008
Haven't really thought about it.

56:15.010 --> 56:20.314
I won because I knew exactly what I wanted
to do when I was king of this hill.

56:20.316 --> 56:23.517
If you don't know what you want,
you'll die on the track,

56:23.519 --> 56:25.321
and The Sprawl
will cheer your death.

56:26.322 --> 56:27.555
So the question is,

56:27.557 --> 56:29.791
what do you want?

56:55.451 --> 56:57.152
Come on, baby.
Get in.

57:03.593 --> 57:05.060
That was insane tonight.

57:06.161 --> 57:08.429
The answer's no, Bexie.

57:08.431 --> 57:11.131
You don't want to ride shotgun
in Death Race.

57:11.133 --> 57:12.335
Yes, I do.

57:14.202 --> 57:15.569
It's a death sentence.

57:15.571 --> 57:18.539
Frank's killed people
I care about.

57:18.541 --> 57:20.376
I wanna be part of
putting him down.

57:28.384 --> 57:29.851
I'll think about it.

58:11.494 --> 58:13.228
I thought
we could have a drink.

58:22.538 --> 58:23.872
Mmm.

58:24.973 --> 58:25.974
So who's Merry?

58:27.677 --> 58:30.613
She your favorite groupie, or are
you just really into Christmas?

58:33.014 --> 58:35.917
It's, uh, my sister Meredith.

58:37.085 --> 58:38.454
She died
when I was in the service.

58:41.189 --> 58:42.625
Never got to say good-bye.

58:44.292 --> 58:46.061
Can't change it,
so I, uh...

58:52.968 --> 58:56.102
Seen a lot of bad stuff.
Done a lot of bad things.

58:56.104 --> 58:57.440
Merry was good.

58:59.007 --> 59:00.476
Better than me,
that's for sure.

59:05.581 --> 59:07.113
I was, uh...

59:07.115 --> 59:10.085
I was born in Little Rock.

59:10.986 --> 59:13.286
Son of a preacher man?

59:13.288 --> 59:15.589
Hardly.

59:15.591 --> 59:19.192
My old man was a grease monkey
in a pair of coveralls.

59:19.194 --> 59:22.496
His idea of a good time was
drinking Dixie beer on the porch

59:22.498 --> 59:24.399
and counting
the fireflies.

59:28.370 --> 59:31.940
Spent most of my young life in
Sweetwater, Texas, on a salvage yard.

59:34.376 --> 59:37.212
Merry passed away
in Long Beach.

59:38.648 --> 59:40.315
That's how I ended up there.

01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:15.583
So the good news is the V-8,
standard transmission, and it runs,

01:00:15.585 --> 01:00:17.785
but the bad news is,
well, it needs

01:00:17.787 --> 01:00:20.286
tires, brakes,
a total engine overhaul,

01:00:20.288 --> 01:00:22.388
a fuel cell, armor, weapons...

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.424
Man, don't bore me
with a list.

01:00:24.426 --> 01:00:26.261
Bottom line,
it needs everything.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.431
- What the hell's this thing?
- Your tombstone.

01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:33.233
Bulletproof titanium plate.

01:00:33.235 --> 01:00:34.637
Protects your fuel cell.

01:00:37.072 --> 01:00:39.072
You got a navigator yet?

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:40.710
Hell yeah, he does.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.713
I'm the motherfucker
riding shotgun.

01:00:46.248 --> 01:00:49.451
The hell you looking at?
I got antifreeze in my veins.

01:00:51.486 --> 01:00:53.221

The speedometer's been calibrated
at 200 miles per hour.

01:02:30.886 --> 01:02:32.688
Think that's all
she's got?

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:35.156
Let's find out.

01:02:38.193 --> 01:02:41.327
This Death Race
is one lap, one day.

01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:43.897
The race begins and ends
at the air field.

01:02:43.899 --> 01:02:46.201
A lot of speed here,
a few obstacles.

01:02:51.339 --> 01:02:53.807
The second leg
is on Interstate 94.

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:57.543
Most of the lesser cars will be taken
out on this long stretch here.

01:02:57.545 --> 01:03:01.314
Watch out for the highway gangs.
This is their turf.

01:03:01.316 --> 01:03:04.752
And then you hit the projects.

01:03:04.754 --> 01:03:06.856
All kind of bad boys
in there.

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:11.659
If you come out of there alive,

01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:13.927
you end up
in the meatpacking district.

01:03:13.929 --> 01:03:14.897
Home free.

01:03:17.733 --> 01:03:19.632
<i>Driving
is more important than killing.</i>

01:03:19.634 --> 01:03:21.501
Shoot only
when you must.

01:03:21.503 --> 01:03:23.706
Think slow, drive fast.

01:03:25.373 --> 01:03:27.675
Rule number one:

01:03:27.677 --> 01:03:30.378
Keep your ass alive.

01:04:11.787 --> 01:04:13.321
That was incredible.

01:04:15.057 --> 01:04:16.792
Don't fucking touch me.

01:04:55.363 --> 01:04:56.464
Hi.

01:05:04.106 --> 01:05:05.607
So you like cars?

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:10.913
Yeah. I like
American muscle.

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:13.983
I had a Vette.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:16.852
Rebuilt it myself.

01:05:18.988 --> 01:05:22.355
1970 LT-1.

01:05:22.357 --> 01:05:24.091
Ooh.

01:05:24.093 --> 01:05:25.793
Stingray.

01:05:25.795 --> 01:05:27.930
Used to love to open her up
on the highway to Vegas.

01:05:30.065 --> 01:05:35.002
Pedal to the floor,
370 horses running hard.

01:05:35.004 --> 01:05:39.106
Rochester Quadrajet carb
getting the mixture just right.

01:05:39.108 --> 01:05:41.041
Momentum shift,

01:05:41.043 --> 01:05:43.012
stay off the brakes,
get her on her toes.

01:05:45.014 --> 01:05:46.748
Man, could she fly.

01:05:49.084 --> 01:05:51.619
I bet you talk like this
to all your girls.

01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.626
I got nothing
outside these walls.

01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:03.698
Merry was my last connection
to anything real.

01:06:06.568 --> 01:06:11.372
So when she died, I...
made a bad decision and...

01:06:13.441 --> 01:06:15.443
wound up here,
not caring about anything...

01:06:16.979 --> 01:06:18.047
or anyone.

01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:26.654
But now...

01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:33.528
But now?

01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:10.257
We're coming for you!

01:08:10.259 --> 01:08:12.061
We're coming for you, boy!

01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:26.966
Sergeant Gibson.

01:09:26.968 --> 01:09:29.336
No one's called me that
in a long time.

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:33.671
Connor Gibson is not the man
we are coming to know.

01:09:33.674 --> 01:09:36.008
He is a warrior.

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:40.080
A very decorated
and specialized warrior,

01:09:40.082 --> 01:09:42.115
known in the shadow world
of government killers

01:09:42.117 --> 01:09:45.085
for his wet work
with the CIA.

01:09:45.087 --> 01:09:48.990
Targeted killing is his forte,
and I am his mark.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.792
He's here at the behest
of Weyland International.

01:09:53.795 --> 01:09:56.662
Sent here by the fascists
from the outside

01:09:56.664 --> 01:09:59.031
because they think
I've gained too much power.

01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:01.368
They fitted him with a strap,

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.605
and he hangs around their waist
like a hatchet.

01:10:06.075 --> 01:10:08.175
There's a helicopter ride
to freedom

01:10:08.177 --> 01:10:10.843
waiting for him
at the finish line.

01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:12.181
Tell me, Sergeant,

01:10:13.282 --> 01:10:15.047
am I wrong?

01:10:15.049 --> 01:10:19.186

01:10:19.188 --> 01:10:23.156

01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:29.662
Traitor!

01:10:29.664 --> 01:10:31.764
will be allowed to race.

01:10:31.766 --> 01:10:34.267
Fuck that, Frank!
What if he wins?

01:10:34.269 --> 01:10:35.903
Then he wins!

01:10:37.038 --> 01:10:40.107
And that is what's meant to be.

01:10:40.109 --> 01:10:42.344
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

01:10:47.748 --> 01:10:51.418
So tell me, who's hiding
behind the mask now,

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.788
me or you?

01:10:55.224 --> 01:10:57.058
See you
on the starting line.

01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:02.895
Stupid traitor.

01:11:02.897 --> 01:11:05.200
He's gonna
tear him apart anyway, man.

01:11:16.811 --> 01:11:18.213
Is it true?

01:11:23.385 --> 01:11:24.986

I'm still
one of your pit crew.

01:11:46.208 --> 01:11:48.774
I don't care if they have
sent you to kill him or not.

01:11:48.776 --> 01:11:51.010
He's a liar, Bob.

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:53.480
- A liar who's working for the man.
- Eh, get over it.

01:11:53.482 --> 01:11:56.418
Yeah. He's good
for business.

01:11:58.019 --> 01:11:59.321

01:28:41.189 --> 01:28:44.223
<i>Only five Death Racers left
as they head into the projects.</i>

01:28:44.225 --> 01:28:47.526
<i>Frankenstein is still in the lead,
with Gipsy Rose a close second,</i>

01:28:47.528 --> 01:28:50.396
<i>and Connor Gibson's eating
everyone's dust in dead last.</i>

01:28:50.398 --> 01:28:53.133
<i>Stage three: the projects.</i>

01:29:25.999 --> 01:29:28.302
- Agh!
- Fucking Death Race!

01:29:41.282 --> 01:29:43.317
- <i>Scheiße!</i>
- Whoo-hoo!

01:29:49.823 --> 01:29:51.523
Aaah!

01:29:51.525 --> 01:29:53.461
<i>Verdammt Scheiße!
Scheiße!</i>

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:08.476
Hey, you!

01:30:09.610 --> 01:30:10.977
Did you do this?

01:30:11.945 --> 01:30:13.947
No! We did!

01:30:15.383 --> 01:30:17.351
Just the man
I was gunnin' for.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.988
How ya doin', Wonder Bread?

01:30:23.857 --> 01:30:25.258
Goose-stepping motherfucker!

01:30:28.228 --> 01:30:30.261
<i>Fick dich, Schwarze!</i>

01:30:30.263 --> 01:30:32.398
Oh, no, he didn't!

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.366
Did he just say
what I think he said?

01:30:34.368 --> 01:30:37.135
Yeah, but in German.

01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:38.936
<i>Fick dich deine Mutter!</i>

01:30:38.938 --> 01:30:40.905
Whoo.

01:30:40.907 --> 01:30:44.610
You and your bitch
brought your skinhead shit

01:30:44.612 --> 01:30:46.846
to the wrong part of town.

01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:51.419
Get ready to play.

01:31:29.289 --> 01:31:31.189
We gotta reroute him
over the bridge.

01:31:31.191 --> 01:31:34.225
He's too far out
to win this race.

01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:36.628
I'm not telling him.
Get him online.

01:31:38.599 --> 01:31:40.399
<i>Talk to me, Bob.</i>

01:31:40.401 --> 01:31:42.200
We need to reroute you
over the bridge.

01:31:42.202 --> 01:31:45.002
- The bridge is out.
- Why the fuck are you rerouting me there?

01:31:45.004 --> 01:31:47.539
You're too far behind.
You have to jump the gap.

01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:49.708
What are we talking
about, like 50 feet?

01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:52.210
More like 250 feet.

01:31:52.212 --> 01:31:53.512
That's your only chance,

01:31:53.514 --> 01:31:55.148
<i>if you wanna win.</i>
I have to win.

01:32:19.172 --> 01:32:23.341
<i>No one's gonna shed a tear for
Nazi Bastard and his nasty little fräulein.</i>

01:32:23.343 --> 01:32:27.111
<i>I mean, boo-hoo. It's not a
real loss to the planet Earth.</i>

01:32:27.113 --> 01:32:29.280
<i>Four drivers remain.</i>

01:32:29.282 --> 01:32:33.621
<i>Frankenstein and Gipsy Rose have opened up a
big lead on Johnny Law and Connor Gibson.</i>

01:32:51.639 --> 01:32:53.337
How do we do this, Bob?

01:32:53.339 --> 01:32:56.675
You've gotta hit the gap
at 220 miles an hour.

01:32:56.677 --> 01:32:58.342
There's a ramp there.

01:32:58.344 --> 01:33:00.479
Not the first time
this has been tried.

01:33:00.481 --> 01:33:03.214
You know we're only calibrated
to 200 miles an hour.

01:33:03.216 --> 01:33:04.750
Don't worry.
She'll get you up to 220.

01:33:04.752 --> 01:33:07.385
Anyone ever made
this jump before?

01:33:07.387 --> 01:33:10.023
On paper, the math works.

01:33:15.529 --> 01:33:18.697
- What about the landing?
- I ain't gonna lie to you. It's gonna be a hard one.

01:33:18.699 --> 01:33:21.633
If you get your angle right,
you might live.

01:33:21.635 --> 01:33:23.069
Yeah, fuck you very much.

01:33:25.506 --> 01:33:27.006
That rat fuck is back.

01:33:37.383 --> 01:33:38.552
Punk-ass bitch!

01:33:45.693 --> 01:33:47.293
That worked well.

01:34:04.077 --> 01:34:05.546
Yeah! Yeah!

01:34:09.082 --> 01:34:11.652
Okay. Let's get this
done already.

01:34:14.655 --> 01:34:17.455
<i>Take your next left.
The bridge is five miles out.</i>

01:34:17.457 --> 01:34:19.492
- That's your only chance.
- You like this play, Bob?

01:34:20.594 --> 01:34:21.760
It's your only play.

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.597
I'll see you on the other side.

01:34:31.739 --> 01:34:35.041
You should get out, Bexie.
We're all out of road.

01:34:36.142 --> 01:34:38.209
Not fucking happening.

01:34:38.211 --> 01:34:41.047
The minute I got in this car
with you, I was all in.

01:34:42.716 --> 01:34:44.350
So let's do this.

01:34:46.319 --> 01:34:47.487
It's just gravity.

01:35:04.772 --> 01:35:06.504
We're maxing out at 209.

01:35:06.506 --> 01:35:07.507
I'm dropping the tombstone.

01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:38.137
Come on, come on.

01:36:40.734 --> 01:36:43.334
Yes, yes, yeah!
All right!

01:36:43.336 --> 01:36:44.703
Told you the math worked.

01:36:46.539 --> 01:36:47.706
All right!

01:36:47.708 --> 01:36:49.007
Whew.

01:36:49.009 --> 01:36:50.744
I could suck you off right now.

01:36:54.915 --> 01:36:56.848
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

01:36:56.850 --> 01:36:59.918
<i>Connor Gibson jumped the bridge, putting
him right back in the thick of it.</i>

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.655
<i>Motherfucker got game. Mmm.</i>

01:37:04.024 --> 01:37:06.024
Come on, kid!
Don't let me down!

01:37:06.026 --> 01:37:07.828
You gotta win this race.

01:37:19.472 --> 01:37:20.941
Here comes your boyfriend.

01:37:22.843 --> 01:37:24.778
Hey, Bex,
patch me through to Frank.

01:37:32.886 --> 01:37:34.753
<i>Hey, Frankie.</i>

01:37:34.755 --> 01:37:37.956
Hey, Connor. Glad you showed
for your date with destiny.

01:37:37.958 --> 01:37:40.424
I knew it would come down to us.

01:37:40.426 --> 01:37:41.762
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

01:37:43.362 --> 01:37:45.629
<i>We can start shooting
at each other or we can drive.</i>

01:37:45.631 --> 01:37:47.364
What do you prefer?

01:37:47.366 --> 01:37:48.501
Let's drive.

01:38:15.963 --> 01:38:19.967
Come on, come on. We're running out
of time. Take him out already!

01:38:32.913 --> 01:38:34.813
What's going on?

01:38:39.086 --> 01:38:40.319
His fuel cell's empty.

01:38:45.725 --> 01:38:47.293
Ah!

01:38:48.796 --> 01:38:51.428
What the fuck? Drive, Connor!

01:38:53.834 --> 01:38:55.002
We're out of gas.

01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:18.357
Fuel line's ruptured.

01:39:58.598 --> 01:39:59.965
Don't do it.

01:39:59.967 --> 01:40:02.702
Just turn around
and win your race.

01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:07.406
This is Death Race.
He has to die.

01:40:09.542 --> 01:40:10.643
He knows it.

01:40:12.913 --> 01:40:14.413
He chose it.

01:41:17.044 --> 01:41:18.709
All right!

01:41:22.882 --> 01:41:24.848
That's our cue.
Send in the chopper.

01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:25.986
It's already en route.

01:41:34.627 --> 01:41:35.895
Get the fuck
out of here.

01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:41.467
I got you. I got you, Jane.

01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:47.538
Jam the broadcast
to the dark Web.

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:50.910
But this is good stuff. J-Just do it.
Cut it for five minutes.

01:41:55.148 --> 01:41:57.648
Oh, shit.

01:41:57.650 --> 01:41:58.918
What is happening?

01:42:01.254 --> 01:42:03.789
This is what the warden wants.

01:42:04.992 --> 01:42:06.826
He wants Frank's death
on display.

01:42:07.927 --> 01:42:09.294
We give it to him,

01:42:09.296 --> 01:42:10.830
we lose.

01:42:12.132 --> 01:42:13.133
Fuck him.

01:42:30.716 --> 01:42:32.551
Job's done. Let's go.

01:42:34.021 --> 01:42:35.122
Hold on.

01:42:43.363 --> 01:42:44.962
They sent two of us?

01:42:44.964 --> 01:42:46.532
Insurance.

01:42:47.767 --> 01:42:50.601
Pretty wild, huh?

01:42:50.603 --> 01:42:53.371
And thanks for the assist.

01:42:53.373 --> 01:42:56.640
Everybody was so focused on you,
I flew under the radar.

01:42:56.642 --> 01:42:59.210
Let's get the fuck
out of this shithole.

01:42:59.212 --> 01:43:01.279
Frankenstein's dead.

01:43:01.281 --> 01:43:03.150
It's a job well done.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.255
Oh, and by the way...

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:12.092
we're all square now.

01:43:14.727 --> 01:43:16.595
Twenty seconds and I'm gone.

01:44:07.247 --> 01:44:09.214
<i>Connor, listen up.</i>

01:44:09.216 --> 01:44:13.016
Put on the mask.
Become Frankenstein.

01:44:13.018 --> 01:44:16.820
<i>The Sprawl will never follow
Connor Gibson.</i>

01:44:16.822 --> 01:44:18.791
They follow Frankenstein.

01:44:19.925 --> 01:44:22.995
Without him, chaos.

01:44:52.259 --> 01:44:54.660
Let's finish this race,
Long Beach.

01:46:17.344 --> 01:46:20.811
Now, put Death Race back online.

01:46:24.083 --> 01:46:26.183
Goldberg's gonna be pissed.

01:46:26.185 --> 01:46:28.118
He put heavy action
on Connor.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.489
Easy come, easy go.

01:46:36.463 --> 01:46:37.930
Fuck you, Valentine.

01:46:51.043 --> 01:46:54.044
Yeah!
