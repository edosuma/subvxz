WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.169
PREVIOUSLY ON  CHASING LIFE...

00:03.204 --> 00:06.006
-WHO IS THIS?
-THAT GIRL IS OUR HALF-SISTER.
NATALIE ORTIZ.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.042
WE'VE GOT NOTHING IN COMMON
EXCEPT THE FACT THAT
WE SHARE A DAD.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.212
SINCE YOUR CANCER HAS
RETURNED THIS AGGRESSIVELY
AND THIS QUICKLY,

00:12.246 --> 00:14.247
IT'S MUCH MORE SERIOUS.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.150
THEY CAN'T LAY YOU OFF
BECAUSE YOU'RE SICK.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.454
IT'S DOWN TO YOU AND DANNY,
BUT YOU COULD HAVE GROUNDS
FOR A LAWSUIT.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.521
SO THEN DANNY WILL BE OUT.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.492
I QUIT.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.126
THE DONATION PROCESS
IS ANONYMOUS

00:26.160 --> 00:29.163
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY
THEIR ONLY HOPE.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.297
SO I COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.433
-WE HAVE A MATCH.
-FINALLY.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.137
AS YOU GO THROUGH
ALL OF THIS

00:36.170 --> 00:39.640
TO FIND YOUR OWN CLOSURE
ABOUT YOUR DAD, I CAN
BE HERE FOR YOU.

00:39.673 --> 00:43.076
YOU THINK DOMINIC COULDN'T
POSSIBLY WANNA DATE ME
FOR REAL?

00:44.244 --> 00:47.247
-WILL YOU MARRY ME?
-YES.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.798
WHERE'S MY RESEARCH, ABBI?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.665
(coughs)
I'M WORKING ON IT.

01:05.698 --> 01:09.637
WORK FASTER AND IF YOU'RE SICK,
DON'T COME IN TOMORROW.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.204
NOBODY HAS TIME FOR THAT.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.444
I ASKED FOR THE RE-WRITE ON
THE D.A. CANDIDATE FRONT-RUNNERS
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

01:17.478 --> 01:21.248
NO, YOU DIDN'T, RAQUEL,
BUT I JUST SENT IT TO YOU.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.615
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:23.349 --> 01:24.784
-BITCH.
-I HEARD THAT.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.721
-HEY.
-HEY.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.390
I'M HEADING OUT.
YOU UP FOR A LAST-MINUTE
DINNER?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.860
OH, I CAN'T. I HAVE TO DO
A FOLLOW-UP ON THAT INTERVIEW
REGARDING THE D.A. RACE.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.430
PROBABLY ABOUT
A FEW MORE HOURS.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.665
-I'LL MEET YOU AT HOME?
-YOU BET YOU WILL.

01:38.698 --> 01:42.503
MMM. I CAN'T WAIT.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.881
-(chattering)
-(machines beeping)

02:08.395 --> 02:12.265
MORNING, SUNSHINE.
HOW YOU FEELING?

02:12.299 --> 02:15.468
I'M ENJOYING THIS CHEMO WAY
MORE THAN THE LAST BATCH.

02:15.502 --> 02:18.771
WE SHOULD BE SURE
TO REMEMBER

02:18.806 --> 02:21.574
THE VINTAGE
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

02:21.609 --> 02:25.278
A BLEND OF TOXIC TANNINS
WITH A LESS NAUSEATING FINISH.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.681
MAYBE WE'LL SERVE IT
AT OUR WEDDING.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.483
OOH, YEAH. ABOUT THAT...

02:29.516 --> 02:33.888
NO TAKE-BACKS, SORRY.
WHO SHOULD WE TELL FIRST?

02:33.920 --> 02:37.525
WELL, ASSUMING YOU HAVEN'T
ALREADY TEXTED BETH
LIKE A MILLION TIMES.

02:37.557 --> 02:40.527
-I HAVEN'T.
-(knock on door)

02:40.561 --> 02:42.530
I'M NOT HUNGRY.
YOU WANT MY BREAKFAST?

02:42.562 --> 02:46.266
NEUTROPENIC PRE-PACKAGED
BANANA LOAF? YES, PLEASE.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.668
COME IN.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.236
-HEY!
-OH.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.337
DOMINIC.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.340
I KNOCKED.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.210
-DIMPLES.
-HEY, LEO.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.681
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GET ME
A TEDDY BEAR, THANK YOU.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.651
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT  THE POST.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.352
I WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.222
YOU KNOW ME,
DOWN BUT NEVER OUT.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.959
I HAVE AT LEAST ANOTHER
MONTH HERE, THOUGH.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.329
-HOW'S GRAHAM? I MISS HIM.
-HE'S GOOD. REALLY GOOD.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.198
WANT ME TO LEAVE YOU
TWO ALONE FOR A BIT?
I CAN STEP OUT.

03:18.231 --> 03:21.268
NO, NO, NO, I SHOULD GO.
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.
WHAT'S WITH THE TAPE, THOUGH?

03:21.301 --> 03:25.239
HMM? UH, THIS IS A RING.

03:25.271 --> 03:29.242
-WE'RE ENGAGED.
-THAT. YES.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.414
THAT'S--
CONGRATULATIONS!

03:40.653 --> 03:44.258
-(theme music playing)
-♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

03:44.290 --> 03:46.993
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

03:47.227 --> 03:50.364

04:08.782 --> 04:12.586
ALL DONE.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.556
(sighs) GREAT, OKAY, MOM.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.358
NOW CAN YOU GIVE THE DOWNSTAIRS
BATHROOM A ONCE-OVER?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.427
I'LL GIVE YOU A ONCE-OVER.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.762
-WHAT WAS THAT?
-I SAID I'LL GIVE YOU
A ONCE-OVER.

04:22.795 --> 04:26.500
FOR THE PAST THREE DAYS
WE HAVE SCRUBBED EVERY
SURFACE IN THIS HOUSE.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.502
IT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY
DISINFECTED FOR APRIL.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.338
NO GERM COULD POSSIBLY LIVE
HERE AND I DON'T BLAME THEM.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.942
I'M HOME.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.810
(laughs) RUN, APRIL,
THE HOUSE COULD KILL YOU!

04:37.845 --> 04:40.680
-WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
-IGNORE HER.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.951
-APRIL!
-Emma: WELCOME HOME, KIDDO.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.954
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
HOME SO EARLY?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.523
SHE BARELY WAITED FOR THEM
TO DISCHARGE HER.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.425
I WANTED TO MAKE IT HOME
BEFORE BRENNA LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.826
-HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
-LUCKY.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.461
THIS ROUND WASN'T AS BAD
AS THE LAST ONE.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.331
IT'S GOTTA FEEL GOOD TO BE DONE
WITH THE HOSPITAL FOR A WHILE.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.733
YES, BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK
TOMORROW FOR SOME BLOOD WORK

05:00.767 --> 05:03.704
AND TO GET THE RESULTS OF MY
BIOPSY TO MAKE SURE THE CHEMO
DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.706
AND THEN BEFORE MY TRANSPLANT...

05:05.738 --> 05:07.341
WE GET HITCHED.

05:07.374 --> 05:10.043
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS ARE
REALLY GETTING MARRIED.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.346
-WE REALLY ARE.
-REALLY?

05:13.379 --> 05:15.048
DID YOU THINK WE WEREN'T?

05:15.081 --> 05:17.418
I ASSUMED IT WAS THE CHEMO.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.487
LIKE WHEN I HAVE A COUPLE
GLASSES OF WINE AT BRIDGE

05:20.521 --> 05:23.990
AND I AGREE TO SEE MORE
OF PEARL AND THEN I DON'T.

05:24.024 --> 05:28.862
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT IT IS DEFINITELY
HAPPENING.

05:28.896 --> 05:33.533
DO YOU WANNA HELP ME
UNPACK

05:33.567 --> 05:34.701
UPSTAIRS?

05:34.735 --> 05:38.872
YES, SURE.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.475
(mutters)

05:49.983 --> 05:53.420
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS
THIS IS A BAD IDEA?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.488
I MEAN, I CAN'T BLAME APRIL.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.959
LEO'S RICH AND STRAPPING,
WITH THOSE BROAD SHOULDERS

05:58.992 --> 06:00.494
AND BLUE EYES THAT JUST --

06:00.526 --> 06:04.630
MOM, CAN WE PLEASE NOT OBJECTIFY
THE GIRLS' BOYFRIENDS?

06:04.665 --> 06:09.403
WHAT ABOUT THEIR FIANCES?
WHOM APRIL HAS KNOWN
FOR ONLY SIX MONTHS.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.105
FOUR OF WHICH WERE SPENT
IN A COMA.

06:12.139 --> 06:16.944
LOOK, SINCE SHE TOLD ME,
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO GEORGE

06:16.976 --> 06:21.415
AND RIGHT NOW THIS IS
BRINGING HER HAPPINESS
AND HOPE THROUGH HER TREATMENT,

06:21.447 --> 06:23.417
WHICH IS GOOD
FOR HER RECOVERY.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.918
AND THE REST OF HER LIFE?

06:24.951 --> 06:28.555
SHE'S WEARING BIOHAZARD TAPE
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.023
SHE'S NOT GONNA GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.961
NO MATTER HOW GREAT LEO IS,
APRIL IS STILL APRIL.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.463
I THINK SHE'S GONNA
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.468
OKAY.

06:42.603 --> 06:47.141
-(sighing)
-(laughs)

06:47.173 --> 06:50.009
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY
NOT TO BE IN A BED.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.845
AT LEAST WE KNOW
THE FLOOR'S CLEAN.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.980
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.149
EW.

06:55.182 --> 06:59.620
SO YOUR GRANDMA SEEMED
PRETTY SURPRISED

06:59.653 --> 07:01.588
THAT WE WERE REALLY
GETTING MARRIED.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.591
I HONESTLY CAN'T BELIEVE
MY MOM'S SO COOL WITH IT.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.026
IF IT HELPS, MY PARENTS
HAVE BEEN PLENTY WEIRD.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.896
NOT REALLY.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.598
I THINK IT WAS WHEN I ASKED
THEM FOR THE GENERATIONS-OLD

07:11.632 --> 07:16.170
HENDRIE FAMILY RING MY
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER LEFT ME
FOR WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT.

07:16.202 --> 07:19.439
HEY, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A BIG FLASHY RING GIRL.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.440
I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY
WITH MY TAPE.

07:21.475 --> 07:25.077
OH, GOOD. SO I CAN JUST

07:25.112 --> 07:26.713
GIVE THIS BACK THEN.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.582
(gasps)

07:31.485 --> 07:34.687
NO, I MEAN, IT WOULD BE
RUDE FOR YOU TO GIVE IT
BACK NOW.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.891
-OF COURSE.
-WOW, OH, MY GOD,
IT'S STUNNING.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.928
-LET'S SEE.
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.
-OH, IT FITS.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.468
MY PARENTS WANT TO TALK TO
YOUR MOM ABOUT WEDDING PLANS.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.637
THEY WANT TO THROW US
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY
THIS WEEK.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.608
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.877
I FEEL LIKE THE LUCKIEST
GIRL IN THE WORLD.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.485
DAMN, GRANNY HENDRIE.
LADY HAD SOME TASTE.

08:06.519 --> 08:09.088
I KNOW. YOU'RE THE FIRST
ONE I'M SHOWING IT TO.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.625
I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT IT.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.026
WELL, YOU'D BETTER LIKE
IT 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR
ENGAGEMENT RING.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.663
OH, BY THE WAY, I STARTED
LOOKING AT DRESS OPTIONS.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.565
FOUND A FEW
YOU MIGHT LIKE.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.668
BETWEEN THAT AND WORK,

08:21.701 --> 08:23.637
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE HOSPITAL LAST WEEK.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.673
AND DENVER THE LUMBERSEXUAL
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT?

08:26.706 --> 08:30.677
HE'S DEFINITELY WAY MORE LIKE
THE GUYS I USED TO DATE.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.578
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING
POST-GRAHAM.

08:32.613 --> 08:36.549
AND HOW ARE YOU,
POST- THE POST?

08:36.582 --> 08:39.186
IT'S TOUGH. LAST TIME
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,

08:39.219 --> 08:41.654
I KNEW I WOULD SEE
EVERYONE EVENTUALLY.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.924
NOW WHO KNOWS WHO I'LL KEEP
IN TOUCH WITH SINCE I WON'T
SEE THEM EVERY DAY.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.692
DOES THAT APPLY
TO EVERYONE THERE?

08:46.726 --> 08:48.662
YOU MEAN DOMINIC?

08:48.695 --> 08:52.298
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
SINCE THE TEDDY BEAR INCIDENT.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.168
I HATE HOW HE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT.
I FEEL SO BAD.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.940
HE SEEMS FINE. I SEE HIM
ALL THE TIME WITH NATALIE.
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

08:59.972 --> 09:04.144
IT'S PROBABLY
BETTER IF I DIDN'T.

09:04.177 --> 09:08.215
DON'T YOU DO IT. I'M GETTING
THIS ONE AND THE NEXT
MILLION AFTER THIS.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.951
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
-YOU TOOK THE BULLET
FOR ME DURING LAYOFFS.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.552
YOU SAVED MY ASS.
I NEVER COULD'VE DONE THAT.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.922
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.657
I STILL NEVER
WOULD'VE DONE IT.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
-IF THE SHOE WERE
ON THE OTHER FOOT--
-NOPE, I PROMISE YOU,

09:19.225 --> 09:22.028
I REALLY WOULDN'T.
SO THANK YOU.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.097
SO DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE
GIVING UP ON JOURNALISM?

09:25.131 --> 09:28.601
NO WAY. I'M GONNA HAVE MY
TRANSPLANT IN A FEW WEEKS.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.772
AND THEN, IN ABOUT FOUR
MONTHS, HOPEFULLY I'LL
HAVE MY OLD LIFE BACK.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.240
IN THE MEANTIME,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.740
WHAT CAN I DO?

09:34.774 --> 09:36.710
CAN YOU JUST GET THE WORD OUT
THAT I WILL BE LOOKING?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.678
I WANT TO SET UP SOME
INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS

09:38.711 --> 09:41.581
AND START A FOUNDATION
FOR MY BIG RETURN.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.716
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T
STAY AWAY FOR LONG.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.722
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

09:49.755 --> 09:52.625
JUST BLOOD.
LOTS AND LOTS OF BLOOD.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.594
WELL, I WAS WAITING AT HOME
FOR YOU AT HOME.

09:54.628 --> 09:59.599
OH, SORRY. WE CAME STRAIGHT
FROM MY PLACE. WHICH IS
VERY CLEAN. I PROMISE.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.735
-SORRY.
-HEY, SARA, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO MY PARENTS?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.037
NO, WHY?

10:04.071 --> 10:06.639
THEY JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOME WEDDING PLANS

10:06.673 --> 10:08.908
AND AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY
THEY WANNA HOST THIS WEEK.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.110
THIS WEEK?

10:10.143 --> 10:12.078
ISN'T THAT SO NICE
OF THEM, MOM?

10:12.111 --> 10:14.681
-OH, I FORGOT.
LOOK AT THIS.
-(gasps)

10:14.715 --> 10:17.616
-I KNOW.
-WOW!

10:17.650 --> 10:20.620
DR. HAMBURG, I WAS JUST
SHOWING MY MOM THIS.

10:20.653 --> 10:24.291
WOW, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.360
THANK YOU. ARE YOU DOING
THAT THING WHERE YOU
PRETEND TO HAVE BAD NEWS?

10:27.394 --> 10:31.764
YOUR ONCOLOGIST DOES THAT?
WOW, SHE'S WAY MORE
PLAYFUL THAN MINE.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.634
WAIT, IS THIS
REALLY BAD NEWS?

10:34.668 --> 10:39.172
THE CHEMO DIDN'T DO
WHAT WE NEEDED IT TO DO.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.308
APRIL, YOU'RE NOT IN REMISSION.

10:42.341 --> 10:46.145
FORTUNATELY, YOU'RE NOT
NEUTROPENIC, SO YOU WON'T
HAVE TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL.

10:46.178 --> 10:49.048
WE CAN CLOSELY MONITOR
YOU AS AN OUTPATIENT

10:49.081 --> 10:52.918
WHILE WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NEXT.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.422
OKAY, SO MORE CHEMO THEN?
WHAT DO WE --

10:55.654 --> 10:57.790
MOM, STOP. I JUST--
GIMME A MINUTE.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.061
I NEED A MINUTE.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.441
APRIL, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.342
DR. HAMBURG SAID THAT THERE
ARE CLINICAL TRIALS.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.378
THIS IS JUST--
IT'S A SETBACK.
THAT'S ALL.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.815
APRIL, HEY, HEY, LOOK AT ME.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.883
I NEED A SLEDGEHAMMER.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.750
YOU CAN'T DESTROY
MASS MEDICAL AGAIN.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.153
HOW DID IT NOT WORK?

11:26.186 --> 11:29.121
WHAT IF THE CLINICAL
TRIAL DOESN'T WORK?
YOU HEARD HAMBURG.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.825
I'M CAN'T GET A BONE
MARROW TRANSPLANT UNTIL
I'M IN REMISSION.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.027
OKAY, OKAY, COME WITH ME.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.945
YOU KNOW, BEING UP HERE
ALWAYS HELPED

11:51.977 --> 11:54.947
PUT THINGS
INTO PERSPECTIVE.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.153
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF?

12:01.187 --> 12:03.190
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-SAY IT.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.224
WHY?

12:04.256 --> 12:06.326
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP
FIGHTING IT.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.961
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE, APRIL.

12:08.995 --> 12:12.731
I'M NOT READY.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.037
BUT YOU HAVE THIS TIME NOW
TO GET READY.

12:17.070 --> 12:22.042
MOST PEOPLE, HEALTHY PEOPLE,
THEY SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

12:22.075 --> 12:25.946
BEING SCARED AND INERT.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.917
WHEN I WAS SICK,
ONCE I ACCEPTED THE FACT

12:30.951 --> 12:33.753
THAT THE TUMOR WAS
GOING TO KILL ME,

12:33.787 --> 12:35.889
THAT'S WHEN
I STARTED TO LIVE.

12:40.025 --> 12:44.096
HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN
I ASKED YOU TO MARRY ME?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.865
AMAZING.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.334
AND ALIVE.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.837
FOCUS ON LIVING LIKE THAT.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.389
COME ON, TRUST ME.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.399
-(gasps)
-IT'S OKAY.

13:21.368 --> 13:25.205
IF YOU WERE TO FALL OFF
THIS ROOF RIGHT NOW,

13:25.238 --> 13:28.942
WHAT REGRETS
WOULD YOU HAVE?

13:32.111 --> 13:35.881
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO FOCUS ON.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.421
LIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.431
HI.

13:55.601 --> 14:00.005
-Everyone, say hi to April.
-We wish you were here, kiddo.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.908
Hi, honey, we're gonna
save you a piece of cake.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.244
Who wants some champers?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.078
Brenna:
YOU SEE HOW I CUT TO
NATALIE IN THE SCENE?

14:06.111 --> 14:09.916
THIS IS SO COOL.
AND I'M GLAD SHE WAS THERE.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.418
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T
GET YOU DRUNK.

14:11.451 --> 14:15.288
YEAH, I KNOW THINGS HAVE
BEEN WEIRD BETWEEN
YOU GUYS LATELY

14:15.322 --> 14:20.293
BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE DOMINIC
THING, BUT SHE WAS AWESOME.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.096
IT WASN'T THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU, THOUGH.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.398
STOP THAT FACE.

14:25.432 --> 14:29.068
NO, THIS IS JUST
A LITTLE SETBACK.
I WANNA HEAR MORE ABOUT YOU.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.136
HOW'S GREER?

14:31.171 --> 14:34.240
WELL, WE TALK
PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.177
I THOUGHT THAT CHARTON
WOULD SUCK WITHOUT HER,
BUT IT'S KINDA GREAT.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.980
OH, I'LL SHOW YOU.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.649
ME AND FORD JOINED
CHARTON'S FILM CLUB.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.985
I'VE LEARNED TO DO SOME EDITING
WITH MY FANCY CAMERA.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.587
Hey, Brenna.
Do you need someone to film?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.155
WHO'S THAT?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.225
OH, THAT'S JUST ERIKA.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.893
EVERYONE THINKS THAT
WE SHOULD BE DATING

14:53.927 --> 14:57.397
BECAUSE SHE'S BASICALLY
THE LAST OUT LESBIAN
AT CHARTON.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.365
BUT SHE'S NOT EVEN
IN FILM CLUB.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.234
SHE'S JUST ALWAYS POPPING BY.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.602
SOUNDS LIKE SHE LIKES YOU.
SHE'S PRETTY.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.672
EH, SHE'S NO GREER.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.942
HOPEFULLY,
IN LIKE 10 OR 15 YEARS,

15:08.975 --> 15:10.210
I'LL FIND MY LEO.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.011
OR YOUR LEAH.

15:15.215 --> 15:19.184
AT LEAST I HAVE THE HEROIN
TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.486
UM...

15:20.519 --> 15:23.188
JUST KIDDING. IT'S NOT HEROIN.

15:23.222 --> 15:25.258
IT'S JUST THE SHOTS I HAVE
TO TAKE A FEW DAYS

15:25.292 --> 15:28.394
BEFORE MY BIG
STEM CELL DONATION.

15:29.696 --> 15:33.033
-ARE YOU SCARED?
-KIND OF.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.634
DR. HAMBURG ASKED ME

15:34.668 --> 15:38.638
IF I WANTED UPDATES ON HOW
IT GOES WITH THE RECIPIENT.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.706
I MEAN, I WANT TO KNOW
IF THINGS GO WELL.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.009
-BUT--
-IF IT DOESN'T?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.715
AREN'T MOST KIDS YOUR AGE
WORRYING ABOUT PROM DRESSES

15:48.947 --> 15:52.619
-AND ACNE MEDICATION?
-RIGHT.

15:52.652 --> 15:57.289
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.525
MAYBE IT'LL BE WORSE
NOT KNOWING.

15:59.558 --> 16:03.096
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST-- I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ANY REGRETS.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.070
(knock on door)

16:11.638 --> 16:15.475
-APRIL. HEY.
-HEY.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.077
WHEN'D YOU GET OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.613
YESTERDAY.
AND YES AND NO.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.249
COME IN.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.990
(sighs)
THE REASON I'M HERE

16:31.024 --> 16:34.461
IS THAT I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU FROM MY LIFE.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.330
WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE EACH OTHER
AT  THE POST  EVERY DAY.

16:37.364 --> 16:41.467
AND I MISS YOU.
I MISS OUR FRIENDSHIP.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.138
I KNOW THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN
GREAT BETWEEN US AND I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.440
I'M SURE YOU REGRET
ASKING ME OUT IN
THE FIRST PLACE.

16:47.474 --> 16:51.311
HEY, HEY. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO REGRETS ABOUT YOU
BEING IN MY LIFE.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.547
I WANT YOU IN MY LIFE

16:54.581 --> 16:56.448
IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.384
DEAL.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.525
HEY, DOM. APRIL.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.528
-HOW ARE YOU?
-GREAT... ISH.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.730
FORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.334
LOOKS LIKE MY CANCER KICKED
CHEMO'S ASS THIS TIME.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.136
SO I WON'T BE GETTING
A TRANSPLANT ANYTIME SOON.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.073
OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.741
YEAH, WELL...
I'M GONNA GET GOING.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.111
YOU PROBABLY NEED
TO GET TO WORK.

17:25.144 --> 17:29.315
HEY, I DON'T HAVE TO WORK
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.218
WE'RE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE
I KNOW THAT HAVE NOWHERE
TO BE BEFORE 10:00 A.M.

17:32.251 --> 17:33.252
WANNA HANG OUT?

17:40.292 --> 17:43.462
I'VE SENT OUT
LIKE 20 RESUMES
AND NOTHING SO FAR.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.699
DIDN'T YOU JUST GET OUT
OF THE HOSPITAL?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.234
YEAH, BUT SINCE
I'M NOT GOING BACK
ANYTIME SOON,

17:49.269 --> 17:50.670
I MAY AS WELL KEEP
MY CAREER ON TRACK.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.638
AND JOURNALISM IS
A TOUGH BUSINESS.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.375
THE LONGER YOU'RE OFF THE
RADAR, THE HARDER IT IS
TO GET BACK ON.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.077
HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOT
THAT GREAT WITH IDLE TIME.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.548
WHAT? NO.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.617
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,
I COULD BARELY TAKE A SICK
DAY WITHOUT A SHAME SPIRAL.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.519
AND MY MOM COULD BARELY
KEEP ME IN SCHOOL.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.391
WAY TOO MUCH TO SEE AND DO.
AND THAT WAS JUST FIRST GRADE.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.792
YOU SOUND LIKE BRENNA.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.395
THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT
FOR HER, BY THE WAY.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.432
I'M A GIRL OF MY WORD.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.434
HOW DO YOU GUYS DO IT?

18:22.469 --> 18:24.804
NOT GIVE A DAMN?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.239
YES.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.607
PEOPLE ARE WAY MORE
SELF-INVOLVED THAN YOU THINK.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.711
LOOK AROUND. EVERYONE'S ON
THEIR PHONES, IN THEIR HEADS.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.713
DISTRACTED FROM ALL THE FUN
THEY COULD BE HAVING.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.884
LOOK AT THESE GUYS.
THEY'RE HAVING A BLAST.

18:39.586 --> 18:43.655
-YEAH, BUT THEY'RE--
-(laughs)

18:45.592 --> 18:47.259
COME ON.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.865
YEAH!

18:53.566 --> 18:56.502
♪ I SAW YOU FALL ♪

18:56.536 --> 19:01.473

♪ WORDS TOO CLOSE BY ♪

19:29.836 --> 19:33.439
I WOKE UP PRETTY EXHAUSTED
AND I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW
THIS AFTERNOON,

19:33.472 --> 19:35.575
SO I THINK A TRANSFUSION
WILL HELP.

19:35.607 --> 19:39.679
HAVE A SEAT HERE
AND I'LL BE RIGHT
BACK TO GET YOU STARTED.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.346
THANK YOU.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.497
(gasps) SORRY.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.232
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU--
I THOUGHT THAT--

20:00.266 --> 20:02.335
I JUST WASN'T SURE
YOU WERE OKAY.

20:02.367 --> 20:06.338
-I WAS MEDITATING.
-COOL.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.673
I'M DONE WITH THIS
IF YOU WANT IT.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.509
THE OBITS? I'M GOOD.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.313
CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S NOTHING
BETTER TO READ IN HERE, RIGHT?

20:13.346 --> 20:16.316
I LIKE READING THE OBITS.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.250
COOL.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.926
WE HAVE A COUPLE HOURS.
I'M VANESSA. TELL ME
ABOUT YOURSELF.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.730
I'M APRIL. I'M A JOURNALIST.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.901
I USED TO WORK AT
THE BOSTON POST,
BUT I HAD TO QUIT.

20:34.933 --> 20:39.305
FORTUNATELY MY FRIEND DANNY SET
ME UP WITH AN INTERVIEW AT
THIS PLACE CALLED  SITE-GEIST.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.574
IT'S LIKE AN INTERNET
NEWS MEDIA COMPANY--

20:41.607 --> 20:44.576
I ASKED ABOUT YOU
NOT YOUR JOB.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.511
WHO ARE YOU?

20:46.546 --> 20:49.382
UM...

20:49.414 --> 20:51.951
WELL, I'M APRIL CARVER.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.920
AND (stammering)

20:56.788 --> 20:58.423
I'M--

21:01.294 --> 21:04.696
I HAVE THIS INTERVIEW,
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET READY FOR IT.

21:15.942 --> 21:20.480
(chuckling)
SO ALL OF THIS IS A BIT
OF A WHIRLWIND, RIGHT?

21:20.512 --> 21:24.983
I MEAN, THEY'VE ONLY KNOWN
EACH OTHER A LITTLE WHILE.

21:25.018 --> 21:28.820
-KIDS CAN BE IMPETUOUS.
-YEAH, THEY CAN BE.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.590
EXCEPT APRIL ISN'T.

21:31.624 --> 21:36.295
SHE JUST--
SHE JUST NEVER HAS BEEN.

21:36.328 --> 21:40.066
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA, RIGHT?

21:40.298 --> 21:42.067
WELL, THEY BOTH SEEM
VERY INTENT ON IT.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.471
HAS LEO GIVEN YOU ANY INSIGHT
AS TO WHAT PROMPTED THIS?

21:46.506 --> 21:48.607
HE LOVES YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:48.641 --> 21:53.311
AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE,
WHEN LEO WAS TERMINAL, HE DID
ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.048
APRIL IS NOT TERMINAL.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.917
SHE JUST HAD A MINOR SETBACK
IS ALL.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.887
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S HER
DYING WISH OR ANYTHING.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.823
NO, NO, NO,
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.

22:03.855 --> 22:07.359
LEO EXPLAINED THAT THIS IDEA
CAME ABOUT JUST AFTER
APRIL RELAPSED.

22:07.393 --> 22:11.998
AND WELL, SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT MAYBE NEVER SEEING
HER OWN WEDDING.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.499
AND...

22:16.568 --> 22:18.971
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.682
-SO DANNY SPEAKS
VERY HIGHLY OF YOU.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW DANNY AGAIN?

22:29.715 --> 22:32.518
WE BOTH WENT TO HARVARD.
HE WAS CRAZY COMPETITIVE.

22:32.551 --> 22:33.618
SOUNDS LIKE DANNY.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.454
AND HE ALWAYS TRIED
TO SLEEP WITH ME.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.789
ALSO SOUNDS LIKE DANNY.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.394
I'M IMPRESSED HE SURVIVED
BLACK TUESDAY AT  THE POST.

22:41.426 --> 22:44.130
I WAS AT  THE SENTINEL
FOR A FEW YEARS,
BUT THEY SCALED BACK, TOO.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.032
SO I'M SYMPATHETIC TO
THE SITUATION YOU'RE IN,
PROFESSIONALLY AND MEDICALLY.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.067
I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT

22:49.102 --> 22:51.403
WITH WHAT I HAVE AHEAD
OF ME MEDICALLY,

22:51.436 --> 22:52.771
I CAN STILL COVER A LOT
OF GROUND FROM HOME.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.039
WHICH IS GREAT WITH US.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.608
OUR OFFICE IS REALLY COME
AND GO AS YOU PLEASE.

22:56.642 --> 22:59.412
SO HERE AT  SITE-GEIST,
WE'RE PUTTING OUT
CONTENT DAILY,

22:59.444 --> 23:01.480
COVERING SOME WORLD
AND NATIONAL NEWS,

23:01.513 --> 23:05.050
BUT THE BULK OF OUR WORK
IS PRODUCING INFO-TAINING
QUIZZES AND LISTS.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.519
IT'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.488
I READ YOUR SAMPLES
AND I'M ALREADY A HUGE FAN.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.023
SO THE JOB IS YOURS IF
THAT'S A LINE OF JOURNALISM
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.528
I AM A JOURNALIST AND I CAN
DO WHATEVER I'M HIRED TO DO.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.962
GREAT.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.134
(rock music playing)

23:21.166 --> 23:25.570
-WHOO! I GOT A JOB.
-(cheering)

23:25.605 --> 23:28.574
AND SPECIAL THANKS TO DANNY
FOR HOOKING UP THE INTRODUCTION.

23:28.607 --> 23:29.909
I'M JUST GLAD JASMINE
DOESN'T HOLD A GRUDGE.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.511
-SHE WAS ALL OVER ME
IN COLLEGE.
-UH-HUH.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.945
SO WHERE ARE WE GOING,
BY THE WAY?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.981
FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS,
NOWHERE.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.984
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
RIDE IN ONE OF THESE, SO
I FIGURED, WHY NOT TONIGHT?

23:39.018 --> 23:40.486
OF ALL THINGS YOU COULD
DO TO CELEBRATE.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.954
THAT'S MY GIRL.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.459
AND THEN DOM GOT US INTO
A SHOW AT THE SINCLAIR.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.894
YEAH, WHAT CAN I SAY?
I KNOW PEOPLE.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.597
SO, DENVER.
TELL ME, HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

23:52.632 --> 23:55.134
Denver: AT BUKOWSKI'S
TAVERN A FEW WEEKS AGO.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.701
YOU WANNA HEAR SOMETHING
REALLY FUNNY?

23:56.736 --> 23:59.605
-ALWAYS.
-WELL, LIKE, THE NIGHT WE MET.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.039
I WASN'T EVEN GOING OUT TO
HOOK UP OR ANYTHING.

24:01.073 --> 24:05.111
I'M USUALLY CHILLING AT
LIKE, BACKBAR, DEEP ELLUM.

24:05.144 --> 24:09.080
AND THEN JUST LIKE, BOOM.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.151
-THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
-(mouths) WHAT?

24:12.184 --> 24:14.153
COME ON, LET'S GO DANCE.
COME ON.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.855
Denver: DANCE!

24:15.887 --> 24:18.523
-GOD, I HATE THIS SONG.
-(rock music playing)

24:18.557 --> 24:22.461
HEY, HEY, LISTEN.

24:22.494 --> 24:23.962
DOES THAT VOICE SOUND FAMILIAR?

24:23.996 --> 24:26.833
-I DON'T THINK SO.
-OH, COME ON.

RIGHT?

24:43.516 --> 24:47.686

TO THE SHOW BECAUSE HE
SAID HE WAS REVIEWING HER.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.624
-BUT HE WASN'T.
-OH, PRETTY SNEAKY, DOM.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.993
WE ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE

24:55.027 --> 24:56.494

HOMEWORK AND THEN I HAVE
A MEETING THERE THIS AFTERNOON,

25:41.039 --> 25:43.041
BUT I NEED TO HIT
THE HOSPITAL FIRST.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.244
ARE YOU STILL MAD
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

25:46.278 --> 25:50.115
I'M NOT MAD.
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

25:50.148 --> 25:52.550
WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

25:52.585 --> 25:54.319
YOU GUYS ARE OBVIOUSLY
NOT DATING ANYMORE.

25:54.552 --> 25:55.621
YOU'RE NOT CO-WORKERS.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.623
WELL, HE'S DATING
MY HALF-SISTER.

25:57.656 --> 26:01.760
AND I WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH DOMINIC.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.829
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

26:04.864 --> 26:05.096
MORNING, YOU TWO.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.067
AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

26:09.101 --> 26:10.670
NO, GRANDMA.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.105
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

26:13.138 --> 26:16.942
IF I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT. DO I?

26:16.976 --> 26:18.877
MORNING.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.948
-EVERYTHING OKAY?
-THEY'RE NOT FIGHTING.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.016
-(sighs)
-NO.

26:24.049 --> 26:27.319
-APRIL, GOT A SECOND?
-I'M ACTUALLY ON MY WAY OUT.
CAN WE TALK LATER?

26:27.353 --> 26:29.821
-WELL--
-WAIT A MINUTE.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.327
-HERE.
-DID YOU MAKE MY LUNCH?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.363
HAVE A GOOD DAY, BABE.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.333
THANK YOU.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.203
-HEY, LEO.
-YEAH.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.973
SINCE WE'RE GONNA BE FAMILY
SOON, I'M GONNA GIVE
YOU A LITTLE TIP.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.241
KEEP THE TOILET
SEAT DOWN, OKAY?

26:52.010 --> 26:53.846
YOU'RE IN A HOUSE
FULL OF WOMEN.

27:03.888 --> 27:06.358
SO THIS MORNING I'M GETTING
COFFEE AND THE GUY ASKS
FOR MY NAME.

27:06.392 --> 27:09.060
AND I'M LIKE,
"ERIKA. WITH A 'K.'"

27:09.095 --> 27:10.863
AND HE'S LIKE,
"GOT IT, WITH A 'K.'"

27:10.895 --> 27:13.833
AS HE'S WRITING IT
WITH A "C-K."

27:13.865 --> 27:16.335
THAT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.971
ANYWAY, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT HITTING THE SOUTH END.

27:19.005 --> 27:21.106
-WANNA COME?
-I HAVE FILM CLUB.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.144
OH, RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

27:25.176 --> 27:29.914
I HAVE MY SISTER'S
ENGAGEMENT PARTY AND JUST
ALL OF THIS FAMILY STUFF.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.217
IS THIS FILM CLUB?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.719
IT WILL BE.
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE SO FAR.

27:33.752 --> 27:36.822
OH, NO WORRIES. I'M MARGO.
I'M MENTORING FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

27:36.855 --> 27:40.960
I ACTUALLY USED TO GO HERE, BUT
I JUST GRADUATED FROM EMERSON
FILM SCHOOL LAST SEMESTER.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.230
AWESOME. YOU KNOW,
I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

27:45.364 --> 27:49.234
I'M GONNA GO.
HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.702
YEAH. YOU TOO.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.972
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU
BESIDES DITCHING YOUR FRIEND?

27:54.006 --> 27:56.174
WAS IT THAT OBVIOUS?
I'M SORRY.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.912
I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER
YOU. I'M JUST NEW TO
ALL THIS FILMMAKING STUFF.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.913
I CAN STILL HELP YOU.

28:01.946 --> 28:05.183
OKAY, WELL,
MY SISTER HAS CANCER

28:05.217 --> 28:07.385
AND SHE JUST GOT
SOME MORE BAD NEWS THIS WEEK,

28:07.420 --> 28:09.154
AND I WANT TO MAKE HER
SOMETHING SPECIAL

28:09.188 --> 28:12.391
FOR HER ENGAGEMENT PARTY,
WHICH IS TOMORROW.

28:12.424 --> 28:16.362
YEAH, WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

28:16.394 --> 28:19.198
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY MADE
A SHORT DOCUMENTARY

28:19.230 --> 28:20.398
ABOUT CANCER IN WEST AFRICA.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.335
-YOU'VE BEEN TO WEST AFRICA?
-FOR A SEMESTER.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.172
THERE'S A TOTAL LACK
OF AWARENESS AND RESOURCES
THERE

28:26.204 --> 28:29.107
FOR TREATMENT AND RESEARCH.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.276
ARE YOU SURE YOU WENT
TO CHARTON?

28:30.308 --> 28:33.746
I GUESS I WASN'T YOUR
TYPICAL CHARTON STUDENT.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.780
YEAH, NEITHER AM I.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.483
WELL, I THINK I COULD HELP YOU
WITH SOME IDEAS FOR YOUR SISTER.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.064
-HI, VANESSA.
-HOW'D YOUR INTERVIEW GO?

28:52.097 --> 28:54.133
-I GOT THE JOB.
-CONGRATULATIONS.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.434
THANK YOU.

28:56.469 --> 28:59.105
(sighs)

28:59.137 --> 29:02.307
AND ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE
WHEN YOU ASKED ME WHO I WAS.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.778
WHAT I SHOULD'VE SAID IS I'M
SOMEONE WHO PUTS GREAT VALUE
ON HER CAREER

29:05.810 --> 29:09.181
AND DOESN'T APOLOGIZE FOR IT.
I THOUGHT OF THAT LATER.

29:09.214 --> 29:13.384
AND WISHED I'D SAID IT THEN.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.154
I WAS AN EMT FOR SEVEN YEARS.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.523
PROBABLY SAVED A DOZEN LIVES.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.228
AND THEN I GOT CERVICAL
CANCER AND HAD TO LOSE
ALL MY REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.

29:22.260 --> 29:26.932
CERVIX, OVARIES,
FALLOPIAN TUBES. ALL GONE.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.134
SO I DECIDED
TO BE A LITTLE SELFISH.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.871
STOPPED SAVING OTHER PEOPLE'S
LIVES AND STARTED SAVING MY OWN.

29:31.903 --> 29:36.875
SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN TO EVERY
STATE IN THE U.S. EVEN OKLAHOMA.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.311
AND I'VE VISITED
19 COUNTRIES SO FAR.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.015
I'M ENJOYING MY LIFE.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.950
BECAUSE I READ THESE OBITS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?

29:44.983 --> 29:49.822
FOR MOST OF US, WHAT WE
DO FOR A LIVING IS GONNA
BE LIKE ONE LINE IN IT.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.356
THAT'S IT.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.810
-HMM.
-HMM?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.813
-THESE ARE GOOD.
-GOOD.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.250
-BUT NOT GREAT.
-REALLY?

30:18.284 --> 30:21.987
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH FOR
THE "10 WAYS TO RESOLVE THE
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT."

30:22.020 --> 30:24.589
-IT'S SUBSTANTIATED.
-BUT IT'S NOT FUN.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.259
SUBSTANTIATED'S GREAT,
BUT AT  SITE-GEIST,  FACTS
DON'T HAVE TO COME FIRST.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.395
OR AT ALL.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.964
I THOUGHT THIS WAS STILL
A NEWS ORGANIZATION.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.268
WHAT IS THESE DAYS?
OUR JOB IS TO GIVE
PEOPLE WHAT THEY CRAVE.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.403
WHICH IS FUN THINGS
THAT ARE TWEETABLE.

30:38.436 --> 30:41.006
OH, AND GIFS.
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

30:41.039 --> 30:45.211
LET ME SENT YOU SOME OF
OUR MORE SUCCESSFUL ONES.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.881
"26 REASONS WHY KATY PERRY
THINKS SHE'S KATNISS EVERDEEN."
THAT LOOKS FUN.

30:48.913 --> 30:52.084
"THIRTEEN REASONS WHY
LENA DUNHAM IS NOT THE
VOICE OF OUR GENERATION."

30:52.116 --> 30:54.286
GETTING THAT ONE DOWN
TO 13 WAS NOT EASY.

30:54.319 --> 30:57.222
"SEVENTEEN WAYS PEOPLE
LOOK LIKE THEIR POODLES."

30:57.256 --> 30:59.325
IT'S REALLY FUNNY...
(continues indistinct)

31:13.338 --> 31:15.273
Beth:
"THIRTY-SEVEN REGRETS APRIL
CARVER WOULD HAVE

31:15.307 --> 31:16.942
IF SHE DIED TOMORROW."

31:16.976 --> 31:19.510
-I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU PUBLISHED THIS.
-READ NUMBER SEVEN.

31:19.545 --> 31:23.082
"SHE WOULD REGRET WORKING AT
SITE-GEIST  AND MAKING UP LISTS

31:23.115 --> 31:25.116
JUST TO KEEP HER TITLE
OF JOURNALIST."

31:25.150 --> 31:26.484
THAT COULDN'T HAVE GONE OVER TOO
WELL.

31:26.518 --> 31:29.320
I CAN SCRATCH OFF NUMBER
FIFTEEN OFF MY LIST.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.923
"SHE WOULD REGRET NEVER
GETTING"--

31:31.957 --> 31:34.259
APRIL CARVER GOT FIRED
FROM A JOB?

31:34.292 --> 31:36.127
I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.530
I LOVE IT.
WOW, BABE, YOU LOOK STUNNING.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.666
WE BOTH DO.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.403
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
DYING TOMORROW, RIGHT?

31:44.435 --> 31:47.239
I DON'T.

31:47.272 --> 31:48.606
BUT NEITHER DO YOU.

31:48.641 --> 31:51.410
AND I WAS THINKING IF I DID,

31:51.442 --> 31:54.546
WHAT WOULD MY OBIT SAY?

31:54.579 --> 31:58.182
"APRIL CARVER GRADUATED
FROM VASSAR.

31:58.217 --> 32:02.086

32:08.426 --> 32:11.430
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IT
COULD SAY. "SHE NEVER
TRAVELED.

32:11.462 --> 32:15.401
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY HOBBIES.
NO INTERESTS."

32:15.433 --> 32:18.470
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF MY
BIGGEST REGRETS AND I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT

32:18.503 --> 32:21.440
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS.

32:21.472 --> 32:24.942
I KNOW YOU WILL.

32:24.977 --> 32:28.681
GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY BEST FRIEND IS
GETTING MARRIED.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.650
I WOULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED
IN A MILLION YEARS THAT
THIS WOULD BE YOUR LIFE.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.451
LIKE I SAID.
I'M TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

32:33.484 --> 32:38.089
AND IT FEELS REALLY SCARY.
BUT THAT MAKES IT FEEL RIGHT.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.259
WELL, YOU'RE MARRYING
INTO THE HENDRIE DYNASTY.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.961
BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU AND LEO
CONSIDER ADOPTING ME?

32:42.994 --> 32:47.432
-THEY'RE NOT THAT RICH.
-ARE YOU SURE? I FEEL
LIKE THEY ARE.

32:51.403 --> 32:55.207

SUCCESSFUL JOURNALIST.

THE MOST WONDERFUL JOB
AT A PLACE CALLED...

ZEITGEIST  IS IT?

-SITE-GEIST.  I GOT FIRED.

-HOW'S AUNT KATHY DOING?
-SHE'S GOOD.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.726
WELL, THERE ARE OTHER JOBS.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.463
I'M ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT
PUTTING JOURNALISM ON HOLD
FOR NOW.

34:24.496 --> 34:28.166
I'M JUST WANNA FOCUS ON
THE WEDDING AND THE PRESENT.

34:28.199 --> 34:32.070
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A SECOND?

34:38.242 --> 34:41.213
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
AND YOU CAN JUST STOP.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.481
-YOU MEAN THE WEDDING?
-I MEAN EVERYTHING.

34:43.514 --> 34:47.686
I MEAN, THE WEDDING.
YOUR CAREER. WHAT'S NEXT?
YOUR WILL AND BUCKET LIST?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.454
YOU'RE GIVING UP.

34:49.487 --> 34:52.324
-I AM NOT GIVING UP, MOM.
-YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO DIE,

34:52.356 --> 34:57.362
-BECAUSE YOU HAD A SETBACK.
-THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE SETBACK.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.697
I CAN'T KEEP LIVING IN FEAR.

34:59.731 --> 35:03.668
I NEED TO ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT I'M DYING, AND IT'S TIME
I STARTED ACTING LIKE IT.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.436
YOU'RE WRONG.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.175
BEFORE, I COULDN'T EVEN
CONSIDER THE THOUGHT

35:10.208 --> 35:13.512
WITHOUT FEELING PISSED OFF
OR DEPRESSED,

35:13.545 --> 35:16.481
BUT MY PERSPECTIVE
HAS CHANGED.

35:16.514 --> 35:18.449
YOU CAN STILL GET
THE TRANSPLANT.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.518
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
NORMAL LIFE BACK.

35:20.552 --> 35:23.822
I DON'T WANT IT BACK.

35:23.856 --> 35:28.626
I COULD BE SO FEARLESS
WHEN IT CAME TO MY JOB.

35:28.659 --> 35:33.130
BUT IN MY PERSONAL LIFE,
I ALWAYS PLAYED IT SAFE.
I WAS THE GOOD GIRL.

35:33.164 --> 35:36.601
AND IF I CONTINUE TO MAKE
MY LIFE ALL ABOUT THAT
AND MY CAREER,

35:36.635 --> 35:39.170
I'M GONNA MISS OUT
ON SO MUCH.

35:39.204 --> 35:41.507
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THAT.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.809
AND I DON'T WANNA
DIE LIKE THAT.

35:43.842 --> 35:48.579
I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY
THE HARDEST THING THAT
I COULD EVER ASK YOU, MOM.

35:51.516 --> 35:53.318
I NEED YOU TO ACCEPT THAT,
TOO.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.755
MOM, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

35:56.788 --> 36:00.259
I'M OKAY.
I'M NOT SAD ABOUT IT.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.360
THIS IS MY LIFE,

36:02.393 --> 36:05.163
AND I DON'T WANT TO DIE,

36:05.197 --> 36:09.534
AND I DON'T WANT
TO STOP LIVING MY LIFE.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.802
I JUST NEED TO START
LIVING IT DIFFERENTLY.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.652
Hi, April and Leo.

36:26.684 --> 36:30.322
I wanted to get you something
awesome to celebrate your
engagement,

36:30.355 --> 36:35.226
but I'm young and poor
so this is the best I could do.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.728
So here you go.
Congratulations!

36:37.762 --> 36:40.699
Advice for a happy marriage?
Hmm...

36:40.731 --> 36:42.833
(laughing)

36:42.867 --> 36:44.735
Never go to bed angry.

36:46.304 --> 36:47.438
How the hell would I know?

36:47.472 --> 36:50.242
(laughing)

36:50.275 --> 36:53.478
Pool long-term assets,
diversify.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.514
I've heard something about
communication being important.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.217
Congratulations,
you crazy kids.

36:59.251 --> 37:02.954
-UNCLE GEORGE!
-April, I always knew that
you'd get married before me.

37:02.987 --> 37:05.324
I'll see you all
at the wedding.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.992
You hurt my friend, Hendrie,
I'm coming for you.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.797
Always take
marriage seriously.

37:11.829 --> 37:15.467
I wish you both a long
lifetime of happiness.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.369
Man:  Stay within your means.
Seriously.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.938
Good luck, you two.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.635
WHEN APRIL WAS BORN...

37:50.902 --> 37:54.672
MY ENTIRE OUTLOOK
ON LIFE CHANGED.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.309
AND I'D BEEN WARNED ABOUT THIS
FROM FRIENDS WHO HAD CHILDREN,

37:57.342 --> 38:01.480
BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IT
POSSIBLE.

38:01.512 --> 38:05.416
TO HAVE YOUR WORLDVIEW SHIFT

38:05.449 --> 38:08.019
SO DRASTICALLY, SO QUICKLY.

38:08.052 --> 38:11.489
BUT ULTIMATELY

38:11.523 --> 38:14.925
AND IN EVERY WAY,

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
FOR THE BETTER.

38:19.864 --> 38:23.402
I LEARNED TO EMBRACE AND SAVOR

38:23.434 --> 38:26.304
EVERY MOMENT WITH MY DAUGHTERS,

38:26.338 --> 38:30.409
BECAUSE YOU ONLY GET
THAT OPPORTUNITY

38:30.442 --> 38:34.378
WITH EACH ONE OF THEM ONCE.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.581
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THEY'RE THEIR OWN PEOPLE.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.389
CONGRATULATIONS,
APRIL AND LEO.

38:45.423 --> 38:48.793
-(cheering)
-(clamoring)

38:54.833 --> 38:57.702
-GOOD NIGHT, YOU GUYS.
-GOOD NIGHT, BETH.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.376
NAH. IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.878
I DON'T WANT
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.452
YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE DRUNK.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.420
AND I THINK YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH APRIL.

39:16.454 --> 39:17.956
WHAT?

39:17.989 --> 39:20.858
EVER SINCE YOU FOUND OUT
THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED,
YOU'VE BEEN WEIRD.

39:20.891 --> 39:25.463
AND NOW THAT SHE'S OUT OF THE
HOSPITAL AND BACK IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU'VE BEEN EVEN WEIRDER.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.565
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.634
FOR ONCE I NEED TO FEEL
LIKE SOMEONE'S FIRST CHOICE.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.869
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED.

39:35.940 --> 39:39.677
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID,
"NO, I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH HER."

39:39.710 --> 39:41.746
NOT "SHE'S GETTING MARRIED."

39:41.780 --> 39:45.150
-THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
-LOOK, I WAS GETTING KINDA BORED
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP ANYWAY.

39:45.382 --> 39:49.487
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?
I'M DONE.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.429
-GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.
-WHATEVER.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.119
IF THIS CAN GET ME THROUGH
MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL,

40:21.152 --> 40:24.188
IT CAN DEFINITELY KEEP YOU
ENTERTAINED FOR FIVE TO SEVEN
HOURS OF YOUR DONATION.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.190
FINGERS CROSSED.

40:26.423 --> 40:27.726
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT THE RECIPIENT?

40:27.759 --> 40:29.494
-DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
-I DO.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.963
I'M CHOOSING TO BELIEVE
THAT WHOEVER IT IS,
THEY WILL SURVIVE THIS.

40:32.998 --> 40:35.000
AND IF THEY DON'T,
I CAN HANDLE IT.

40:35.032 --> 40:39.170
I GET ONE DAUGHTER OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL, ONLY TO HAVE
TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE IN.

40:39.204 --> 40:42.541
-OKAY. OKAY.
-WE'RE LATE. LET'S GO. BYE, MOM.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.177
-BYE, APE.
-BYE.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.811
-BYE.
-GOOD LUCK, BREN.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.179
THANKS.

40:53.617 --> 40:54.719
WHAT'D YOU FORGET?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.554
YOU OKAY? DO YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

41:29.588 --> 41:32.257
I'M FINE.
FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME.

41:32.489 --> 41:34.893
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TODAY?

41:34.925 --> 41:36.994
I'M STAYING IN
AND GETTING ORGANIZED.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.097
-SEE? YOU'RE NOT FINE.
-STOP.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.932
I HAVE THESE BOXES THAT
SARA GAVE ME FROM MY
DAD'S STORAGE UNIT

41:41.967 --> 41:45.070
JUST SITTING HERE
COLLECTING DUST.
I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THEM.

41:45.103 --> 41:49.139
WELL, CALL ME IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.842
BYE.

42:08.559 --> 42:11.195
"MY NAME IS TIMOTHY CARSON.

42:11.228 --> 42:14.599
"I HAVE TWO FAMILIES,
WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
EACH OTHER.

42:14.632 --> 42:18.168
"THIS IS THE STORY
OF HOW I LIVED MY LIFE

42:18.202 --> 42:20.938
AND PLANNED MY DEATH."

42:36.987 --> 42:40.291
EVERY THREE MINUTES SOMEONE
IN THE US IS DIAGNOSED
WITH BLOOD CANCER.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.994
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THERE IS A CURE.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.963
IT'S IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE
JUST LIKE YOU.
