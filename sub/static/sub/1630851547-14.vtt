WEBVTT

00:24.111 --> 00:25.460
Well done.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.027
You are improving.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.332
Or I've regressed.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.855
Well,
I don't know about that.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.335
You nearly got me
with that flèche.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.554
Well,

00:32.597 --> 00:34.208
I'm off to ice
all these bruises

00:34.251 --> 00:35.078
you dealt me.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.384
Same time next week?

00:36.427 --> 00:38.255
Yeah,
I look forward to it, Kim.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.605
Magnum.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.042
Hey, Kim.
How are you?

00:42.085 --> 00:43.043
Looking good, man.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.740
Looking good.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.090
- Magnum, what are you doing here?
- Uh, it's-it's a funny story.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.701
I actually saw "fencing"
on the calendar,

00:49.745 --> 00:51.703
and I figured that,
you know, given my role as

00:51.747 --> 00:53.488
head of security, I should
probably show up, right?

00:53.531 --> 00:55.055
Right. Wrong sort of fencing.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.447
And, uh, either way,
you're 30 minutes late.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.580
Also, I'm just kidding,

00:58.623 --> 00:59.885
but I was very happy

00:59.929 --> 01:01.104
I saw that whole exchange,
I mean...

01:01.148 --> 01:02.192
it's pretty impressive.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.585
Although, you know,fencing,

01:03.628 --> 01:05.500
I hear, is one of
the easier sports

01:05.543 --> 01:07.067
to get into in the Olympics.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.330
Something about it
not requiring much skill.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.592
I know what you're doing, Magnum.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.159
You're trying to bait me

01:12.202 --> 01:13.943
into challenging you to a bout.
It won't work.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.684
No, w-why would I do that?

01:15.727 --> 01:16.989
I mean, you're obviously

01:17.033 --> 01:18.339
a skilled fencer.

01:18.382 --> 01:19.688
I wouldn't stand a chance
against you.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.255
Although, I mean, yeah.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.605
I guess we'll never really know.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.694
- Will we?
- Okay.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.696
All right.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.091
- First to ten points.
- Okay.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.180
But what's the point?

01:33.223 --> 01:34.311
Every time I stick you
with the tip

01:34.355 --> 01:36.226
of my foil,
it's a point.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.445
But I wouldn't worry.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.316
It's not gonna take long.
En garde.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.280
- I stand corrected.
- Did I tell you

01:46.323 --> 01:49.152
I had extensive edged weapons
training in the service?

01:49.196 --> 01:52.329
Although the swords weren't
really bendy like this.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.171
That's a penalty.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.912
- You broke the rules.
- What rules?

02:09.955 --> 02:11.783
You can't touch my body
with your body.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.045
You touched me first.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.569
In fact, you're still
touching me.

02:14.612 --> 02:15.961
I did not touch you.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.049
I would never touch you.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.138
Why? Is it not a dream?

02:19.226 --> 02:20.662
Touché.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.144
Okay, uh...

02:24.187 --> 02:25.493
We're gonna have to
call this a draw,

02:25.536 --> 02:26.711
because my old friend
is calling me

02:26.755 --> 02:28.191
and he really
wants to see me.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.540
Well, that's convenient.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.368
No. We actually have to go together.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.022
If he wants to see me
this badly,

02:33.065 --> 02:34.023
it probably means there's
a job for us. Come on.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.772
♪ Grab your coat

02:43.815 --> 02:45.991
♪ And get your hat

02:46.035 --> 02:51.083
♪ Leave your worry
on the doorstep ♪

02:51.127 --> 02:54.783
♪ Just direct your feet

02:54.826 --> 02:57.002
♪ To the sunny

02:58.439 --> 03:02.617
♪ Sunny side of the street.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.489
So...

03:05.533 --> 03:07.230
What do you think?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.014
Well, I think that if I wanted
to be in the business

03:09.058 --> 03:11.713
of appraising instruments,
I would've opened a pawn shop.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.236
A '72 Kamaka,
in that condition,

03:13.280 --> 03:14.977
is easily worth three grand.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.544
Throw in the 600
cash I brought,

03:16.587 --> 03:18.546
and that's just enough
to cover the collateral

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
on the bond.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.376
All right, I'll post bond
and make sure he's released

03:22.419 --> 03:24.073
- by the end of the day.
- Thanks, Melvin.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.422
You're a lifesaver.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.253
Oh, there he is.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.298
Best P.I. on the island.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.430
Or the best P.I.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.736
that would take your call

03:34.779 --> 03:36.216
on a short notice, huh?

03:36.259 --> 03:37.608
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.741
Uh, Higgins, this is...

03:39.784 --> 03:42.047
The one and only Melvin Machado.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.092
It's pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.876
- You, too.
- Yeah.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.791
Melvin threw
a lot of work my way

03:46.835 --> 03:48.532
early on when I was
trying to get started.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.273
If it wasn't for those
early skip tracing jobs,

03:50.317 --> 03:53.885
I probably would not have
been able to stay afloat.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.670
Well, I'm glad
you remember that,

03:55.713 --> 03:57.193
'cause I was actually hoping
you could return the favor.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.542
Of course. What do you need?

03:58.586 --> 04:00.805
One of my clients
missed her court date.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.198
If I don't produce her

04:02.242 --> 04:03.460
in the next 24 hours,
I'm out

04:03.504 --> 04:04.635
- the entire 250
- K bond.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.420
Two-fifty? Ouch.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.335
Don't you
usually have five days

04:08.378 --> 04:10.946
to return a skip
before the bail is forfeited?

04:10.989 --> 04:12.817
All right, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.558
I had someone else
on the job originally,

04:14.602 --> 04:17.518
but the guy went AWOL on me
after asking for a cash advance.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.260
- Who is it?
- Jimmy Wu.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.000
Okay, Jimmy Wu. He's good
at getting his guy.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.175
Although he does have

04:23.219 --> 04:24.699
his share of vices.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.222
He's probably already
blown that advance

04:26.266 --> 04:27.745
betting on college hoops

04:27.789 --> 04:29.094
and is sleeping off
a hangover somewhere.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.618
Yeah.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.142
In retrospect,
agreeing to that cash advance

04:33.185 --> 04:34.665
was probably not
my best decision.

04:34.709 --> 04:35.753
Neither was posting bond

04:35.797 --> 04:37.799
for this skip.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.671
But she seemed
like a safe bet.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.631
You know, ties to the island,
low flight risk.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.634
Stella Torres.

04:46.677 --> 04:47.983
And what's she out on bail for?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.593
About six months back,
she gets pulled over

04:49.637 --> 04:51.073
for speeding.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.857
The cops find an unlicensed gun,
a bunch of cash.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.382
And just to make matters worse,
she resists arrest.

04:56.818 --> 05:01.518
Even still, $250,000 is
the kind of bail they set for...

05:01.562 --> 05:03.085
serious felonies like murder.

05:03.128 --> 05:04.347
Do you have any idea
why it was set so high?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.088
Couldn't tell you.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.308
What I do know is
I can't afford to eat

05:08.351 --> 05:10.353
a quarter-million-dollar loss.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.312
If you don't bring Ms. Torres
back by the end of the day,

05:12.355 --> 05:14.357
I could lose my business.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
Well, obviously,
we can't make any guarantees,

05:16.098 --> 05:17.621
but we will do everything we can

05:17.665 --> 05:19.144
to get your skip back.

05:19.188 --> 05:20.624
That's a promise.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.322
Thanks, kid.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.629
Okay.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.239
You got all your
textbooks, right?

05:27.283 --> 05:28.676
Yeah.
If they weighed any more,

05:28.719 --> 05:30.286
they might dislocate
my shoulder.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.853
Okay, what about
everything else?

05:31.896 --> 05:33.245
Pencils and pens?

05:33.289 --> 05:34.725
- Yep.
- Okay.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.771
Uh, notebooks and binders?

05:36.814 --> 05:38.425
- Check and check.
- Okay.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.383
You got a "snickity snack"
for recess?

05:40.427 --> 05:42.080
It's high school, dude.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.778
I'm pretty sure
there's no recess.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.083
Right.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.303
What am I thinking?
Uh...

05:48.173 --> 05:49.958
What's that for?

05:50.001 --> 05:52.526
Well, you're too good for my
honey-glazed turkey and Swiss,

05:52.569 --> 05:53.875
so I'm guessing you're gonna
have to grab something

05:53.918 --> 05:55.180
from the cafeteria.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.486
I can't take your money.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.184
Not after everything
you've already done for me.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.708
Look, if this whole

06:00.751 --> 06:02.536
foster thing is gonna
work, then you gonna have

06:02.579 --> 06:04.059
to get comfortable
with me looking out for you.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.322
With that said,

06:06.366 --> 06:07.802
I'm only springing for lunch

06:07.845 --> 06:10.239
'cause it's
your first day.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.414
Tomorrow, it's peanut butter
and jelly.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.198
All right.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.157
Thanks.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.506
I really do appreciate it.

06:17.594 --> 06:20.162
You know, it's totally normal

06:20.205 --> 06:22.382
to be a little nervous.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.035
But if you've been

06:24.079 --> 06:25.776
fending for yourself
out here in the streets,

06:25.820 --> 06:28.300
then high school
should be a breeze.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.346
Look, just be yourself

06:30.390 --> 06:33.567
and people will see
what a solid dude you are.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.571
Do you even remember
what high school was like?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.311
Must have been, like,

06:39.355 --> 06:41.009
40 years ago?

06:41.052 --> 06:42.750
Oh.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.316
- All right, I'm off.
- Give me my 20 back.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.535
Uh, no, no, no.
Hold on, hold on.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.233
I got to take a photo first.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.409
All right.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.937
You can't be serious.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.156
Oh, I'm dead serious.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.115
Hold it up.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.857
Ah.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.424
Hold on.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.513
Ah. Yeah, yeah.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.862
Ow!

07:07.905 --> 07:09.646
Okay, enough
with the pictures now?

07:09.690 --> 07:11.474
Hey.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.345
Heard you're starting
classes at McKinley today.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.999
My son Dennis is a senior.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.131
Said he'd catch up
with you today

07:16.174 --> 07:17.828
and show you the ropes.
See?

07:17.872 --> 07:19.700
There's one person
you know already.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
Thanks, Mr. Katsumoto.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.274
I'll see you, TC.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.717
- "Mr. Katsumoto," huh?
- Hey, I wish I could say

07:36.760 --> 07:39.894
I taught the kid his manners,
but he came that way.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.374
Well, I'm glad to see things
are working out.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.898
Well, that's all thanks
to your advice.

07:43.941 --> 07:47.118
Look, I know I didn't
appreciate it at the time,

07:47.162 --> 07:48.772
but you clearly had everyone's
best interests in mind

07:48.816 --> 07:50.513
when you pushed me
to help Cade

07:50.557 --> 07:51.862
the right way.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.516
And that's actually
why I'm here.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.518
Got a phone call from
Social Services yesterday.

07:55.562 --> 07:59.217
Before the agency can
approve your application,

07:59.261 --> 08:01.872
they need to be sure that
a reasonable effort's been made

08:01.916 --> 08:05.223
to locate and notify
Cade's mother Monica Jensen.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.008
Just wanted to let you
know that I'm gonna be

08:07.051 --> 08:09.053
spending the day
trying to track the woman down.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.754
Okay. Thanks for the heads-up.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.017
Of course.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.064
Hey, Gordie.

08:20.108 --> 08:21.501
H-Hold up.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.637
Look, if Cade's mother's
out there...

08:29.247 --> 08:30.510
...I want to help you find her.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.470
You sure about that?

08:35.950 --> 08:38.430
Yeah.

08:38.474 --> 08:38.953
So where do we start?

09:02.933 --> 09:04.413
So I ran our skip's cell.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.675
It seems there is one number

09:05.719 --> 09:06.981
that she called
rather frequently

09:07.024 --> 09:09.157
but it's unlisted.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.637
- Give it a call.
- Yeah.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.685
You've
reached Sergeant Wayne Nix

09:15.729 --> 09:17.208
with HPD's Narcotics
and Vice Division.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.470
Please leave a message.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.647
Why would Stella be
in regular contact

09:20.690 --> 09:22.126
with an HPD
Narcotics officer?

09:22.170 --> 09:24.215
There's only one
way to find out.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.483
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.050
My name is Thomas Magnum
and this is my partner

09:33.094 --> 09:35.792
Juliet Higgins. We're
private investigators,

09:35.836 --> 09:38.534
and we'd love to have a word
with Sergeant Nix if possible.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.797
Mm. He's still asleep.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.147
Is there something
that I can help you with?

09:43.191 --> 09:44.888
It's okay, hon. I'm up.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.673
Come on in.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.544
Can I get you all some coffee?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.632
Think we're good, thank you.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.808
Thank you, though.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.593
Hey.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.812
Sorry I'm not more presentable.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.467
Was up late working a drug raid.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.512
So, how can I help you guys?

10:00.556 --> 10:03.167
We've been hired to track down
a skip named Stella Torres.

10:03.211 --> 10:04.952
Prior to her arrest,
she seemed

10:04.995 --> 10:06.649
to have a lot of contact
with you.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.694
That's true. She did.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.173
Mind if we ask why?

10:09.217 --> 10:11.654
Well, that arrest
wasn't Stella's first.

10:11.698 --> 10:14.657
A couple years back we busted
her for possession with, uh,

10:14.701 --> 10:16.180
intent to distribute.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.618
She was looking
at five years mandatory.

10:18.661 --> 10:19.967
And that was all the leverage
we needed

10:20.010 --> 10:22.056
to get her to work for us.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.492
Mm. Okay, so she was

10:23.535 --> 10:24.928
- a criminal informant?
- Yeah.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.017
She was good at it, too.

10:27.061 --> 10:30.717
But it's usually just a matter
of time before a C.I. slips up

10:30.760 --> 10:33.415
and reverts to their old ways.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.286
Stella was pulled over

10:35.330 --> 10:38.681
with an unlicensed
- gun, 30
- K in cash.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
The kind of money you
use for a drug buy.

10:40.770 --> 10:43.338
I could've gotten
her off if she hadn't

10:43.381 --> 10:45.383
assaulted the
arresting officer.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.689
Ah.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.951
We knew that she had
resisted arrest,

10:47.995 --> 10:49.649
but assaulting a cop
would explain

10:49.692 --> 10:51.128
her high bail amount.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.478
Stella's meltdown
landed her in lockdown,

10:53.522 --> 10:55.176
and before I even had
a chance to check on her,

10:55.219 --> 10:57.831
she had posted and disappeared.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
So you're not surprised
she skipped her court date.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.574
The surprise would've been
if she actually showed.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.272
Especially since she split
for the mainland months ago.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.014
What makes you think that?

11:07.057 --> 11:08.624
It appears as though
Stella left the island

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
shortly after her arrest,

11:10.278 --> 11:12.323
and has been bouncing around
the country ever since.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.108
As of three days ago,
she was in Atlanta.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.458
Well, hold on.
Go back to that picture

11:16.501 --> 11:17.764
right there.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.722
Uh, right there,
that's the River Walk

11:19.766 --> 11:21.245
in San Antonio.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.769
You notice how this grass
is covered in pollen?

11:22.812 --> 11:24.727
Okay, so?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.337
Well, anybody's who's spent time
in San Antonio knows

11:26.381 --> 11:28.992
that that pollen comes
from mountain cedar trees.

11:29.036 --> 11:29.993
In the fall.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.997
And the photo
was posted in August.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.134
According to the metadata,
the photo was taken

11:40.177 --> 11:41.962
in 2019.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.920
I-I bet if you looked at all
her pictures, they all predate

11:43.964 --> 11:45.313
her arrest.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.923
So Stella is trying
to make it look

11:46.967 --> 11:48.403
as if she's on the mainland
when, in actuality,

11:48.446 --> 11:49.926
she never left the island.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.101
I mean, it makes sense.
Once you're on bail,

11:51.145 --> 11:52.189
you can't leave the island.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.151
What is it?

11:57.194 --> 11:58.587
Stella started posting

11:58.630 --> 12:00.763
these travel photos
months ago, right?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.896
The fact that this ruse
started just after

12:02.939 --> 12:04.724
she posted bail makes me think
that it's not just

12:04.767 --> 12:06.595
law enforcement
she's trying to mislead.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.031
We got to do a deep dive
on Stella,

12:08.075 --> 12:09.685
see if we can figure out
where she's staying.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.904
I'll hack into utilities,
see if there are

12:10.947 --> 12:12.949
any bills in her name.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.385
Look at that.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.647
She's been paying
an electricity bill

12:15.691 --> 12:18.085
at a house in Nanakuli.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.059
Magnum, over here.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.585
Well, that's a lot of blood.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.029
He's down.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.561
His pulse is dangerously low.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.435
No signal.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.437
That must be why
he couldn't call for help.

13:07.656 --> 13:08.918
Let's see if I can
find some I.D.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.528
Don't worry about it.
I know him.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.052
That's Jimmy Wu.

13:12.095 --> 13:14.141
The bounty hunter that
Melvin sent after Stella?

13:14.184 --> 13:16.317
So he didn't go AWOL
with Melvin's money, then.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.232
No, I think he found Stella
and she tried to kill him.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.711
I'm gonna go outside,

13:19.755 --> 13:21.061
see if I can find a signal
and call EMS.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.627
Okay.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.040
Hey, Lia.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.303
- Thomas, what are you doing here?
- Working a case.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.828
Looking for a skip
named Stella Torres

13:48.871 --> 13:50.438
and instead found
a bounty hunter shot

13:50.481 --> 13:51.569
and left for dead.

13:51.613 --> 13:53.180
It's sad.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.138
Well, it looks like your
skip tracing job just became

13:55.182 --> 13:57.314
my attempted murder case.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.186
And your skip
is our prime suspect.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.970
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to work together on this one.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.972
It worked out
pretty well last time.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.671
Let's not get
too far ahead of ourselves?

14:06.715 --> 14:08.238
Of course.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.806
Hey, where's Higgins?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.170
Bit of an odd time to be
looking for a snack.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.345
I take it
you've already been

14:28.389 --> 14:30.260
through the house.
What'd you find?

14:30.304 --> 14:33.263
Well, there's no food
in the refrigerator

14:33.307 --> 14:34.874
and the cupboards
are empty as well.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.311
I guess our girl isn't one
for dining at home.

14:37.354 --> 14:40.749
Maybe, or maybe she hasn't
been here in some time.

14:40.792 --> 14:44.187
It takes months for that much
sediment to build up in pipes.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.711
Okay, so if Stella

14:46.755 --> 14:49.366
wasn't here,
who shot the bounty hunter?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.281
Well, Stella was arrested
- with 30
- K in cash

14:51.325 --> 14:52.935
and an unlicensed gun.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.806
According to the officer she
was working for as a C.I.,

14:54.850 --> 14:57.809
he seems to think that
money was for a drug deal.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.159
In which case,
Stella could be on the run

14:59.202 --> 15:00.290
from whoever that money
belonged to.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.552
Could be that person

15:01.596 --> 15:02.945
came looking
for her here

15:02.989 --> 15:04.294
and crossed paths
with the bounty hunter.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.427
The cop you spoke to,
what's his name?

15:06.470 --> 15:07.645
Uh, Sergeant Nix.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.125
He's with Narcotics.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.735
Okay, I'll check in with him.

15:10.779 --> 15:11.823
See if he has any idea
who Stella

15:11.867 --> 15:12.955
was moving drugs for.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.130
You find this girl,

15:14.174 --> 15:15.784
you let me know.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.046
Right away.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.569
Of course.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.661
Is it just me, or was Lia
acting cold back there?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.533
Perhaps.

15:25.576 --> 15:29.232
I don't get it. We both decided
it was best to end things.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.800
Yes, but I suspect she still has

15:31.843 --> 15:33.497
some residual feelings.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.325
You know, seeing you
triggers an emotional response,

15:35.369 --> 15:37.806
reminding her
of what you guys had.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.634
Just give her some time, she'll
sort through her feelings,

15:39.677 --> 15:41.331
and you guys will be fine.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.116
Now enough of your relationship
or the lack thereof.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.552
Look at what I found in
Stella's bathroom cabinet.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.642
Digoxin tablets.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.470
- Heart medicine, right?
- Yeah, for arrhythmia.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.341
But they have to be
taken every single day.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.691
And this prescription
expired months ago.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.519
So if we find out where
she refilled her prescription,

15:55.563 --> 15:57.130
maybe we find Stella.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.004
You know, if we find Monica,

16:02.048 --> 16:03.440
I'd like to ask her
how she could just

16:03.484 --> 16:05.051
abandon her kid like that.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.574
Well, it's hard to know what
the woman was going through.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.402
Yeah, I guess so.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.273
Hey, listen.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.275
I get why you came along.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.321
If I was in your situation,
I would want to be here, too.

16:14.364 --> 16:18.107
But if we find Monica, you got
to keep your emotions in check.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.892
Hey.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.026
Okay, what kind of car
are we looking for again?

16:24.070 --> 16:28.639
According to DMV records,
she owned a 1997 Toyota Camry.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.728
And why do we think it's here?

16:30.772 --> 16:33.253
Registration expired four years
ago, and there's no record

16:33.296 --> 16:35.037
of a change in ownership.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.125
That's it?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.476
Her VIN's the only lead
we got right now, okay?

16:40.521 --> 16:43.002
Okay, gumshoe.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.525
Here we go.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.745
Your Camry was reported
abandoned on Kalaloa

16:47.789 --> 16:51.053
near Pearl Harbor
on January 30, 2018.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.447
That's the same day
Monica split on Cade.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.797
And that part of town's known
as a high drug trafficking area.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.929
Any chance the
car's still here?

16:57.973 --> 17:00.715
I'm afraid not.
No one ever claimed it.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.282
And it was in such
poor condition,

17:02.325 --> 17:03.979
it was scrapped instead
of being sold at auction.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.894
So...

17:05.937 --> 17:08.288
that's it? Dead end?

17:08.331 --> 17:10.420
Maybe not. Standard procedure
is to photograph

17:10.464 --> 17:11.682
the contents of the car
before it's scrapped.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.032
You got anything in the file?

17:17.123 --> 17:18.385
I got to get back out there.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.778
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.911
Thanks.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.528
Glass pipe,
burnt foil paper.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.923
I can't believe
he was living like that.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.056
He never told me about it.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.625
When I first found out
my sister was using,

17:41.669 --> 17:43.105
I didn't say a word to anyone.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
Told myself I was
respecting her privacy,

17:44.846 --> 17:47.370
but really, I was just ashamed.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.027
You see that?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
That looks like the stub
for a welfare check.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.987
Made out to an Ike Tonyan.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.380
Could be someone Monica
used to score with.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.998
Okay, looks like Stella's been
holing up in a cabin

18:07.042 --> 18:08.826
on the Ewa Forest Reserve.

18:12.961 --> 18:14.615
Hey, Lia.
You're on with me and Higgins.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.965
- Any news?
- Afraid so.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.533
I just got a call from the EMTs.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
Jimmy Wu died en route

18:21.187 --> 18:23.798
to the hospital.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.278
Here I am going around

18:25.321 --> 18:26.844
bad-mouthing the guy
like he ripped me off.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.933
The whole time he's bleeding
out somewhere

18:28.977 --> 18:31.414
on a job I sent him on.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.155
HPD is doing everything
that they can

18:33.199 --> 18:34.635
to apprehend
Jimmy's killer.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.159
And, look, we may have
a lead on Stella's location,

18:37.203 --> 18:41.076
so with any luck, we'll
have her in custody soon.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.345
What is it?

18:49.389 --> 18:52.305
I just got a text from Jimmy.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.743
He must have texted you
after he was shot.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.614
And then HPD
powered up the phone,

18:57.658 --> 18:59.964
and it finally got some signal
and the message came through.

19:00.008 --> 19:03.751
"QGR 417."

19:03.794 --> 19:05.492
That's a plate.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.842
The only reason Jimmy would have
to text Melvin that number

19:07.885 --> 19:10.366
is if it was a lead
on whoever shot him.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.020
Yeah, I mean, he must have
spotted somebody tailing him

19:12.063 --> 19:13.413
and wrote down the plate.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.241
Yeah.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.548
Okay, that license plate
is registered to...

19:19.593 --> 19:20.724
...Wayne Nix.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.206
Why would Sergeant Nix
be tailing the bounty hunter

19:24.250 --> 19:26.165
that was looking
for his former C.I.?

19:26.208 --> 19:27.644
I don't know,
but Sergeant Nix obviously

19:27.688 --> 19:29.298
wasn't being entirely
honest with us.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.170
We have to fill in Lia.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.084
Actually, I think we've got
to do more than that.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.738
I mean, Lia's already

19:34.782 --> 19:36.697
on shaky ground,
and now she's got to investigate

19:36.740 --> 19:38.133
a fellow officer?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.439
We have to make sure
she has somebody

19:39.482 --> 19:40.962
that she can trust.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.703
Good point.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.748
We also have to find
Stella fast

19:44.792 --> 19:46.576
or Melvin's gonna forfeit
his entire bail bond.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.232
Plus, I suspect Stella
might be in danger.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.191
Well, it's a good thing
there's two of us.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.543
I think I know why you're here.

19:56.586 --> 19:57.979
I powered up Jimmy Wu's
phone and saw the text

19:58.022 --> 19:59.589
he sent the bail bondsman.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.549
Sergeant Nix is involved in
this, I just don't know how.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.203
Here's what we do know.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.987
Nix either wanted to keep Wu

20:06.030 --> 20:08.729
from finding Stella or he
was looking for her himself.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.079
Those are the only reasons
he would have for tailing Wu.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.777
Yeah, except now I got to find
out why he wants the girl,

20:13.821 --> 20:15.126
and that means going up

20:15.170 --> 20:17.172
against a cop
who outranks me.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.566
I know your reputation has
taken a hit as of late.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.089
No, it's not just that.

20:21.132 --> 20:24.005
Narcotics and Homicide work
together all the time,

20:24.048 --> 20:27.138
so I don't even know which
detectives I can trust on this.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.272
Okay, well, now this
is our problem, all right?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.839
Thomas and I have both agreed

20:31.882 --> 20:33.101
that one of us should
help you look into Nix

20:33.144 --> 20:34.407
and get to the
bottom of this.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.060
And you drew the short straw?

20:36.104 --> 20:37.627
I...

20:37.671 --> 20:40.282
Relax.

20:40.326 --> 20:43.720
It's no secret things
are kind of awkward

20:43.764 --> 20:44.982
between me
and Thomas right now.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.157
Lia, for what it's worth,

20:46.201 --> 20:47.985
this was Thomas's idea.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.031
And the only reason
that he isn't here, too,

20:50.074 --> 20:54.296
is because we have a lead
on Stella's location.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.211
Wait, the last person
who went looking

20:56.255 --> 20:58.169
for Stella got himself killed.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.432
Thomas can't go there alone.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.738
He's not.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.359
Look at you,
all dressed for the occasion.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.883
Nice vest, by the way.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.494
Oh, this old thing?

21:18.538 --> 21:20.844
Also, thanks for parking
away from the house.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.846
Well, it's not my first rodeo.

21:22.890 --> 21:26.110
Wouldn't do us any good if the
skip saw us coming, would it?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.354
Hands where I can see them.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.967
My name is Thomas Magnum,
I'm a private investigator.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.882
I'm here to take you in
on an outstanding warrant

21:58.926 --> 22:01.581
for failure
to appear in court.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.844
Please. If Wayne
put you up to this,

22:03.887 --> 22:06.150
you can't let him know
that you found me.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.153
Look, no one's gonna
hurt you, okay?

22:10.285 --> 22:11.504
It's not me
that I'm worried about.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.041
When I first met Wayne,

22:27.084 --> 22:29.304
I thought he was
my saving grace.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.958
I'd just been arrested
on a drug charge,

22:31.001 --> 22:33.743
and with my priors,
I was looking at serious time.

22:33.787 --> 22:36.746
Taking the deal he offered
seemed like the smart move.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.139
Now I know it was
the worst mistake

22:38.182 --> 22:39.401
I've ever made
in my life.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.968
What happened?

22:41.011 --> 22:42.839
He'd put me in dangerous
situations and then use

22:42.883 --> 22:45.799
the intel I gave him
to rip off drug dealers.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.018
Yeah, he runs
the HPD drug task force,

22:48.062 --> 22:49.759
and if he's shady,
it's safe to assume

22:49.803 --> 22:51.021
half the guys
that work for him are, too.

22:51.065 --> 22:53.415
Wayne's untouchable.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.112
And he made sure
that I knew it, too.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.854
I was terrified of him.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.856
So when he started making
advances towards me,

22:59.900 --> 23:03.382
I just... went along with it.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.950
I'm sorry, Stella.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.739
When I couldn't see
a way out, I just...

23:12.782 --> 23:15.959
I started looking
for a different kind of escape.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.396
Almost started using again.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.443
But then...

23:22.923 --> 23:24.228
...he happened.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.274
And suddenly,
your life isn't the only one

23:26.317 --> 23:28.450
you're fighting for.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.714
He was the wake-up call
that I needed.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.369
I started making plans to leave,

23:34.413 --> 23:36.589
but then Wayne found out
about the baby.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.373
The cops he had

23:38.417 --> 23:40.331
trailing me must have seen me
visit the obstetrician.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.770
Wait, he had guys following you?

23:44.858 --> 23:46.425
All the time.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.819
When Wayne confronted
me about the pregnancy,

23:49.863 --> 23:52.474
I just grabbed some cash
and a gun and I ran.

23:52.518 --> 23:56.260
But before I could get far,
a squad car pulled me over.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.958
So the arresting officers
worked for Nix.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.873
That's why you put up a fight.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.005
Only, I didn't touch them.

24:02.049 --> 24:05.444
They made up the assault
charge to jack up my bail.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.620
It was Wayne
sending me a message.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.753
So, I posted bond

24:10.797 --> 24:12.276
and I've been hiding ever since,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.061
praying that Wayne
wouldn't find me.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.281
He got his C.I. pregnant?

24:17.325 --> 24:19.196
Yeah, a C.I.
he's been desperately

24:19.240 --> 24:20.371
trying to track down.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.938
Well, it's safe to say

24:21.982 --> 24:23.766
that he does not want Stella
to have this baby.

24:23.810 --> 24:26.203
I mean, it's easy for Nix
to deny the claims

24:26.247 --> 24:28.423
of a convicted felon,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.731
but it is awfully hard
to rebut a paternity test.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.863
Yeah, exactly.
If she gives birth,

24:33.907 --> 24:35.474
I.A.'s gonna be all over Nix.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.779
And all the shady stuff
he's done in the past

24:36.823 --> 24:38.520
is gonna come to light.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.913
Well, it's a good thing
you and Rick got to her first.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.436
Well, you know, obviously

24:41.480 --> 24:42.785
she's not very trusting
of law enforcement

24:42.829 --> 24:44.483
at the moment, so, uh,
to keep her safe,

24:44.526 --> 24:46.789
Rick and I are gonna
take her back to Robin's Nest

24:46.833 --> 24:48.051
until Nix is in custody.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.662
And in the meantime, Lia and I

24:49.705 --> 24:51.446
are gonna head back
to Nix's house.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.535
All right, well, stay safe,
both of you,

24:53.579 --> 24:54.928
and, uh, we'll be in touch.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.103
Yeah, we will.

24:59.585 --> 25:03.240
I think maybe it's possible

25:03.284 --> 25:05.112
I may have been a little cold

25:05.155 --> 25:07.201
- toward Thomas.
- Oh?

25:08.985 --> 25:10.813
I have, haven't I?

25:10.857 --> 25:12.989
I mean, things may not have
worked out between us but...

25:14.556 --> 25:16.253
He's still a good guy.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
He is.

25:19.387 --> 25:22.912
I mean, he can be completely
maddening to work with,

25:22.956 --> 25:25.045
but...

25:25.088 --> 25:26.437
at the end of the day,
there is nothing

25:26.481 --> 25:27.917
he wouldn't do for his friends.

25:29.397 --> 25:31.442
And, Lia, he does
consider you one of those.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.707
I guess I just need more time.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.406
It's still kind of raw,
you know?

25:38.449 --> 25:41.452
Yeah, I mean, as it should be.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.150
It hurts because,

25:43.193 --> 25:45.848
you know, what you guys had
really meant something.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.546
And as far as I'm concerned,

25:47.589 --> 25:49.896
those are the only relationships
worth pursuing.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.988
If I hadn't said this before,
I'm really grateful

25:55.031 --> 25:57.251
for your help
on this case.

25:57.294 --> 26:00.515
You haven't,
but you are welcome.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.832
Ike Tonyan?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.660
You have a minute?

26:14.703 --> 26:17.053
Uh, yeah, sure.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.926
Um, my N.A. group starts
in about five, though, so...

26:19.969 --> 26:21.449
No, this won't take long.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.363
We just want to know,
when's the last time

26:22.406 --> 26:24.191
you saw Monica Jensen?

26:29.239 --> 26:30.284
Hey, you okay?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.638
Sorry, uh...

26:36.682 --> 26:39.641
that was a lifetime ago.

26:39.685 --> 26:40.773
Um...

26:40.816 --> 26:43.166
I was a different person.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.254
You mean, an addict?

26:44.298 --> 26:45.995
Oh, well, I'm still an addict.

26:46.039 --> 26:47.693
I'm just a recovering one now.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.217
Um, I've been clean
over three years.

26:50.260 --> 26:55.135
I take it you and Monica
used to get high together?

26:55.178 --> 26:58.791
Well, yeah, but it was-- it...

26:58.834 --> 27:00.009
it was more than that.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.665
Sh-She was a friend.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.624
W-We tried to look out
for each other.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.671
O-One day we, uh...

27:11.368 --> 27:12.674
...we scored some dope

27:12.718 --> 27:14.284
and...

27:14.328 --> 27:17.592
we went to an abandoned
building to shoot up.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.422
And when the sun went down,
it-it got cold

27:21.465 --> 27:23.424
and so we made this little fire

27:23.467 --> 27:24.947
so that we could stay warm.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.776
Then we...

27:27.820 --> 27:29.604
we shot up again and...

27:31.562 --> 27:33.390
...we fell asleep.

27:40.571 --> 27:44.053
Next thing I remember,
I'm waking up

27:44.097 --> 27:46.447
and I'm choking on smoke.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.538
And the entire place is on fire.

27:53.193 --> 27:56.762
I-I tried to wake her up,
but she-she wouldn't move.

27:59.547 --> 28:03.986
For years-- years--
I told myself that...

28:04.030 --> 28:07.642
that she was already dead,
that there was...

28:07.686 --> 28:09.513
there was nothing
that I could do, but...

28:11.472 --> 28:13.517
That was just...

28:13.561 --> 28:15.737
that was just me making excuses.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.739
The truth
is that I-I...

28:17.783 --> 28:19.741
I panicked.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.484
And I ran.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.752
I'm guessing you didn't
report what happened.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.537
Which explains why the body
was never identified.

28:38.151 --> 28:40.109
That woman had a son.

28:43.156 --> 28:44.853
Cade.

28:47.421 --> 28:50.641
She used to talk about him
all the time. She...

28:50.685 --> 28:53.949
She said she was gonna
get clean for him.

28:54.907 --> 28:56.822
She didn't get a chance.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.132
No.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.613
But I did.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.703
Monica is the reason

29:08.747 --> 29:11.053
that I work with addicts today.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.926
I'm gonna need you
to come down

29:13.969 --> 29:15.449
to the station

29:15.492 --> 29:17.233
and give a statement.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.412
All right.

29:25.546 --> 29:27.069
We're good. Let's go.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.641
What's happening?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.340
Stella Torres?

29:37.384 --> 29:38.298
You're under arrest
for the murder

29:38.341 --> 29:39.255
of Jimmy Wu.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.517
Now, h-hold on.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.084
I just got off the phone

29:42.128 --> 29:43.869
with Detective Kaleo.
She's the lead

29:43.912 --> 29:45.566
on this case,
all right?

29:45.609 --> 29:46.915
She didn't say anything
about sending a squad car.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.787
Then take it up with her.
I have my orders.

29:56.272 --> 29:57.752
Get your hands off her.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.191
The hell do you think you're
doing? I remember you.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.540
You were at the crime scene,
right?

30:03.584 --> 30:05.238
Now, the question is,

30:05.281 --> 30:06.674
did you tail me out here
or did you track my cell phone?

30:06.717 --> 30:08.328
Rick.

30:12.898 --> 30:13.855
Go ahead.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.117
Put the bracelets on.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.771
You're making a huge mistake.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.382
If I am, I'm looking at
some serious jail time,

30:19.426 --> 30:21.820
but if I'm not, it means
you're freelancing with Nix.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.604
I'm gonna call Detective Kaleo
right now and I'm gonna find out

30:23.647 --> 30:26.389
if you're supposed
to be out here.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.653
I hope you're right about this.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.266
There's no signal.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.182
Me neither.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.879
I think somebody's
jamming it.

30:39.359 --> 30:42.014
You really thought
I came alone?

30:44.407 --> 30:46.105
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.262
You all right?

31:13.306 --> 31:14.742
I don't know, I'm...

31:14.785 --> 31:16.265
Something hurts.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.267
Uh, probably
Braxton Hicks contractions.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.967
Uh, false labor usually
brought on by stress.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.099
Uh, father-to-be.
I know what to expect

31:24.143 --> 31:26.014
when you're expecting.
Still no signal.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.408
We got to find somewhere we can
hole up and make a phone call.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.540
A-Are there any other houses
around here?

31:30.584 --> 31:33.848
Um, there's one over that ridge.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.980
Think you can make it?

31:35.023 --> 31:37.156
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Okay.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.900
I'm sorry
I can't be more helpful,

31:41.943 --> 31:44.511
but like I said,
the last time I saw Wayne

31:44.554 --> 31:46.208
was when you were here
this morning.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.732
What's this about, anyway?

31:50.386 --> 31:52.258
Your husband was having

31:52.301 --> 31:55.043
a sexual relationship
with one of his C.I.s.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.697
He got her pregnant,

31:56.740 --> 32:00.005
and we believe
he shot and killed a man

32:00.048 --> 32:01.789
to prevent his secret
from coming out.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.535
Mrs. Nix,
we've just informed you

32:08.578 --> 32:09.971
that your husband has
fathered a child with a C.I.,

32:10.015 --> 32:12.495
and-and you have...

32:12.539 --> 32:14.280
no reaction?

32:17.718 --> 32:19.067
I'm sorry.

32:20.851 --> 32:21.896
What did you do?

32:23.376 --> 32:24.855
- Stay with her.
- No...

32:24.899 --> 32:26.640
No. He's not here.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.598
I swear. D...

32:41.655 --> 32:43.091
Juliet.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.745
Over here.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.014
I swear I didn't know.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.451
He just said that
he had a C.I.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.279
who wanted to give up her baby,

32:57.323 --> 32:59.716
but that it was complicated
and I couldn't ask questions.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.980
And that didn't raise
any alarm bells for you?

33:03.285 --> 33:05.026
I don't blame Wayne
for what he did.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.899
After I found out I
couldn't get pregnant,

33:08.943 --> 33:10.466
I started to push him away.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.817
Oh, this is my fault.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.124
Lady, that is all kinds
of crazy.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.039
You're gonna tell us
where your husband is

33:18.083 --> 33:20.433
and you're gonna tell us now.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.044
I really don't know.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.567
But after you two left
this morning,

33:24.611 --> 33:27.266
he told me there was
something urgent

33:27.309 --> 33:28.745
that he needed to take care of

33:28.789 --> 33:30.617
and that I wouldn't be
able to reach him.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.097
He must be going after Stella.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.489
I've got to let
Magnum know.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.928
Straight to voice mail.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.377
We got to get this door open.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.122
Can I help you?

33:57.165 --> 33:58.688
God, I hope so.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.474
Just breathe.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.302
Okay? Just breathe.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.390
Stay calm.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.608
Here you go.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.185
Hello?

34:17.229 --> 34:18.665
Higgins, it's me.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.014
Magnum, we've been trying
to contact you.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.276
Where are you?

34:21.320 --> 34:22.495
Yeah, Nix and his guys
showed up.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.105
We had to bail on foot.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.672
Uh, we're at a neighbor's house,

34:25.715 --> 34:27.239
one klick east
of Stella's cabin.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.067
HPD and SWAT
are already en route.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.199
We'll redirect them to your 20.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.983
Magnum, there's something else
you need to know.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.116
Lia and I paid a visit
to Nix's wife.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.639
He doesn't just want Stella
out of the way.

34:36.683 --> 34:37.727
He actually wants her baby.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.120
He and his wife

34:39.164 --> 34:40.991
plan to raise it themselves.

34:41.035 --> 34:42.471
Wha... What?

34:42.515 --> 34:44.908
No. W-We're not gonna
let that happen.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.215
Just hang tight.
We'll make sure to...

34:49.913 --> 34:51.089
Phone died.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.531
Nix and his men are outside.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.837
Must have cut
the power.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.580
Okay. I know this looks grim,

35:04.624 --> 35:06.713
but we just got to hold them off
until HPD gets here.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.933
I think my water just broke.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.675
Maybe I was wrong

35:12.719 --> 35:14.155
about the whole
false labor thing before.

35:14.199 --> 35:14.764
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.772
- You'll be all right.
- I can't.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.165
- I can't. You're gonna be okay.
- Listen, gravity's

35:24.209 --> 35:25.340
not our friend right now.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.559
Okay, I need you on your back.

35:26.602 --> 35:27.995
I just need you
to lay on your back.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.344
Gonna need a pillow

35:29.388 --> 35:30.650
to prop her head up
and any fresh towels

35:30.693 --> 35:31.477
that you have, please.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.652
Yeah, sure.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.697
I can't. Not here.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.569
I can't have my baby like this.
You're gonna be fine,

35:36.612 --> 35:38.048
you're gonna be fine, okay?
Just breathe for me, all right?

35:38.092 --> 35:41.835
Hold your stomach,
I need you to inhale on four.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.532
I'll count. Okay, you ready?

35:43.576 --> 35:45.186
And one, two,

35:45.230 --> 35:47.145
three, four.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.537
Now exhale for six.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.800
Three, four.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.107
You need anything else?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.108
Good.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.719
Yeah.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.808
Now that you ask,
you have any weapons?

35:58.852 --> 36:00.027
What kind of weapons?

36:00.070 --> 36:01.202
Eh, the kind that shoot bullets,

36:01.246 --> 36:02.464
preferably a lot of them, quickly.

36:02.508 --> 36:03.813
Sorry, all I got's
a compound bow

36:03.857 --> 36:06.686
that I use to hunt boar.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.078
Compound bow, huh?

36:08.122 --> 36:10.777
Remember, I need the girl alive,

36:10.820 --> 36:13.040
so hold your fire around her.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.086
Everybody else goes
in the ground. Go, go.

36:29.709 --> 36:30.927
Take cover!

36:34.540 --> 36:36.237
Don't worry about that.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.412
Just focus on me, okay? Breathe.

36:37.456 --> 36:38.805
Breathe, okay?

36:56.301 --> 36:58.085
Get the girl!

37:00.653 --> 37:01.741
Now, this baby doesn't look
like he wants

37:01.784 --> 37:03.264
to wait.
You ready to push?

37:03.308 --> 37:04.657
You're doing great.
I'm right here with you.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.572
You're doing great.

37:06.615 --> 37:09.488
Okay, you're doing great,
you're doing great.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.404
Just keep breathing, okay?
Keep breathing. That's it.

37:12.447 --> 37:14.971
You're doing great.
I'm right here with you.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.538
Breathe in, one,

37:16.582 --> 37:18.105
two,

37:18.148 --> 37:19.541
three.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.369
Good. You're doing good.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.284
Keep breathing.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.243
Sorry about that.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.592
Okay, now

37:26.635 --> 37:28.158
push.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.160
Push, push!

38:48.891 --> 38:50.284
Hi.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.987
That's great.
Thanks for letting me know.

39:01.164 --> 39:02.862
Good news. Given the situation,

39:02.905 --> 39:05.168
the prosecuting attorney
is dismissing

39:05.212 --> 39:06.953
all charges against Stella.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.346
Amazing.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.217
And the P.A.
is also asking the FBI

39:10.260 --> 39:11.349
to open an investigation

39:11.392 --> 39:13.394
on the narcotics task force.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.874
Or whatever's left of it.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.615
So if there are any remaining
bad apples,

39:16.658 --> 39:18.356
they're gonna be sure
to root them out.

39:18.399 --> 39:19.922
Hmm.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.576
I-- we got Melvin his bond back,

39:21.620 --> 39:23.448
we helped deliver a baby,
we took down

39:23.491 --> 39:25.101
a-a bunch of crooked cops.

39:25.145 --> 39:29.279
I mean, I say that we've earned
at least one more round.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.020
Oh, not for me. I, actually,

39:31.064 --> 39:32.674
am going out for a drink.

39:32.718 --> 39:35.764
Oh, where?
I mean, maybe I'll join.

39:35.808 --> 39:36.896
Uh...

39:36.939 --> 39:38.114
maybe not this time?

39:38.158 --> 39:40.203
I'm actually
meeting up with Lia.

39:40.247 --> 39:42.467
After the day she's had,
she said she could use a drink,

39:42.510 --> 39:43.990
so...

39:44.033 --> 39:45.339
After the day she had?

39:45.383 --> 39:46.819
Mm. My day

39:46.862 --> 39:47.820
was not exactly a walk
in the park.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.082
I know, Thomas,

39:49.125 --> 39:51.737
but she invited me
out for a drink.

39:51.780 --> 39:52.999
Was I supposed
to say no?

39:53.042 --> 39:55.349
No, no, of course not.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.569
You know, I actually think
a girls' night out is-is good.

39:57.612 --> 39:58.700
For both of you.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.528
I think, yeah,

40:00.572 --> 40:02.312
given some time,
she'll come around.

40:02.356 --> 40:05.272
And she could probably use
a friend right now.

40:05.315 --> 40:07.317
Well, that's very mature of you.

40:07.361 --> 40:10.451
Mm. Well, I am actually
quite mature for my age.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.887
If I do say
so myself.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.628
I'm just saying, you know,

40:13.672 --> 40:15.195
I am totally okay

40:15.238 --> 40:16.675
spending the night
out here by myself,

40:16.718 --> 40:18.111
drinking an entire
bottle of wine.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.113
- No big deal.
- Good.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.941
Well, thank you for your
understanding, Thomas.

40:21.984 --> 40:24.030
Well, get-get going.
You're eating into my me time.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.814
Okay, well, enjoy
your peace and quiet.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.469
Okay.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.799
You know, this morning,
when you said

40:53.842 --> 40:55.365
you were gonna look
for Cade's mom,

40:55.409 --> 40:56.932
all I could think about

40:56.976 --> 40:58.194
was how it might affect me.

41:00.022 --> 41:02.851
I was afraid you might
actually find her.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.375
Then this great kid
that I got used

41:05.419 --> 41:06.942
to having around...

41:08.378 --> 41:10.206
...he wouldn't be
in my life anymore.

41:13.558 --> 41:16.038
And now I got to tell
this kid that his mom's...

41:16.082 --> 41:17.562
dead.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.390
For four years,
this kid woke up every day

41:20.434 --> 41:21.609
thinking his mother
abandoned him.

41:23.089 --> 41:24.525
Now he'll know she didn't.

41:36.798 --> 41:39.584
Hey. You were right.

41:39.627 --> 41:42.761
About school, I mean.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.327
So it was good?

41:44.371 --> 41:47.722
Yeah. Yeah, it was,
uh, it was pretty cool.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.768
Even being the new kid
was all right.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.552
Everyone was nice.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.032
Oh, oh,
and the basketball coach

41:53.075 --> 41:55.643
said I could try out
even though it's...

41:55.687 --> 41:56.949
the middle of the season.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.820
That's great, man.

41:59.821 --> 42:01.954
That's really great.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.043
Your face doesn't
seem to think so.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.176
What's wrong?

42:09.091 --> 42:11.093
I got some news today.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.884
I got some news about your mom.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.236
What?

42:26.674 --> 42:28.197
Look, man, she, um...

42:30.156 --> 42:31.810
She...

42:35.161 --> 42:39.208
No. No. No. No.
