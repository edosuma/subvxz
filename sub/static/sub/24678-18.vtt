00:00.660 --> 00:03.140
In New York City war on crime

00:03.170 --> 00:05.810
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:05.840 --> 00:08.320
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.510
These are their stories.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.980
You couldn't wait 10 minutes to
sell this place out from under me.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.150
She's barely in her grave.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.990
I didn't sell the house. Mom did last fall.

00:21.020 --> 00:24.160
What?! Who's going to buy this dump?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.670
Some developers putting up offices.

00:26.690 --> 00:30.690
She got a good deal. This is perfect.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.000
You know, you are really
something, you know that?

00:36.030 --> 00:38.310
You never come out to see her.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.340
and you're going to stand there and complain

00:40.370 --> 00:42.540
that she sold the house so she
could have something to live on?

00:42.570 --> 00:45.920
I'm upset, okay? I just buried my mother.

00:45.940 --> 00:49.350
What is it, Ricky? Kicked
out of your apartment again?

00:56.120 --> 00:58.360
(sighs)

00:59.360 --> 01:01.490
It's okay, Ricky.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.140
They're not taking possession
until the end of the week.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.540
You can stay until then.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.640
The phone's off, but the power's still on.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.510
I need to find contact information
for one of your members--

01:17.540 --> 01:20.520
Jay Lippman. He's a mechanical engineer.

01:22.010 --> 01:27.190
No, "Lipp," with a 2 "P"s-- "Lippman."

01:27.220 --> 01:30.460
You have to book the travel time
as well as the appointment.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.630
I don't want to get there early,

01:32.660 --> 01:34.660
and I don't want to get there late.

01:34.690 --> 01:37.500
And I don't know anyone named Rick Morrissey.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.600
If he calls again, get rid of him.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.750
I got some phone calls today.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.180
Who from?

01:53.210 --> 01:55.350
Whoever it was just hung up.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.520
Four times.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.860
I don't know what you
expect me to say, Anne.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.950
Telemarketers do that.

02:01.980 --> 02:04.590
Not when you pick up, Jay.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.730
I'm not going through this.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.900
You're wrong.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.470
Don't the kids know what time dinner is?

02:16.500 --> 02:18.780
( phone ringing )

02:25.040 --> 02:27.180
Hello?

02:30.010 --> 02:32.520
Oh, sure. How have you been?

02:33.680 --> 02:36.190
That's not going to be possible right now.

02:38.850 --> 02:42.530
Yes. All right.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.830
I have to go out for a minute.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.040
That's just great.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.420
20 years I don't hear from you,
that's the way it's going to stay.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.440
We got a problem, Jay.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.820
Sorry, I don't know you, okay?
That's the way it's going to stay.

03:05.850 --> 03:09.800
Jay, we have to dig it up.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.800
( theme music playing )

03:21.000 --> 03:27.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

04:07.840 --> 04:10.150
It's clay.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.490
She was buried deep, where it's cool.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.089
That explains why there's
only partial decomposition.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.120
That, plus the fact it looks
like the tarp was sealed.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.400
There's no telling how long
she was in the ground.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.500
It's not more than 20 years.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.630
That's a black denim miniskirt
from the London Limited.

04:26.660 --> 04:29.610
They only made them the one season-- 1983.

04:29.630 --> 04:31.770
You wore one of these?

04:31.800 --> 04:34.250
I looked good in it, too.

04:34.270 --> 04:36.580
Her fingers are in okay shape.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.680
We might be able to get prints off them.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.050
I'll need your men to canvass
those buildings over there.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.420
Somebody took the trouble to move her.

04:46.450 --> 04:50.190
You got to wonder why they picked
such a public place to dump her.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.500
The question is why they took
the trouble at all.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.330
- ( knocking )
- What?

05:00.360 --> 05:03.610
That girl in the Bronx River.
I told you, dump it back to Homicide.

05:03.630 --> 05:07.270
It's one of yours. Alyssa Cooney.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.550
You sure? It's a tentative ID.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.560
She had a previous injury. A broken leg.

05:16.580 --> 05:19.460
Right. The body had
a broken femur and clavicle.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.550
Alyssa had a skiing accident when she was 10.

05:22.580 --> 05:26.660
That's her. Give it back to Homicide.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.970
Eames: She was tortured, Captain.

05:29.990 --> 05:33.200
She had rope burns on her wrists
and ankles, her jaw was broken,

05:33.230 --> 05:35.730
she was penetrated with foreign
objects, she was suffocated--

05:35.760 --> 05:38.070
The case is too old. You'll never break it.

05:40.370 --> 05:44.110
Killers like this, they don't stop
after one murder.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.350
Especially one they got away with.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.850
(soft sigh)

05:57.520 --> 06:00.830
( drawer slides, bangs )

06:03.560 --> 06:08.240
We had one suspect.
Her boyfriend, Mike Heskey.

06:08.260 --> 06:12.230
Last I heard, he lived in Queens, off Astoria.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.040
Look, I told the police, I don't
know how many times, what I knew.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.420
The last time I saw her, we were in
a bar on Canal. She was mad at me.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.720
Because you hit her.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.390
People in your dorm saw you hit her.

06:25.410 --> 06:29.120
Yes, that did happen. I was studying
for midterms, and she wanted to party.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.290
And I'm not making any excuses.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.360
It sure sounds like excuses to me.

06:33.390 --> 06:38.030
I've never hit another woman
again in my life. You ask anyone.

06:38.060 --> 06:42.530
What was the fight about?
The one in the dorm?

06:42.560 --> 06:44.810
She was bored with me.

06:44.830 --> 06:47.400
She was shopping around?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.010
She had just moved to the city.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.250
She was like someone
who'd been let out of a cage.

06:52.270 --> 06:54.410
Anything wild, that's--

06:55.280 --> 06:58.920
You again. I told you so many times,

06:58.950 --> 07:01.590
I don't know what happened to Alyssa.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.060
We found the body.

07:06.090 --> 07:09.660
You found her?

07:09.690 --> 07:12.700
We found her where you put her.

07:12.730 --> 07:16.470
After you tied her up,
tortured her, and killed her.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.380
God as my witness, I did no such thing.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.170
It's all there.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.550
Oh, God.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.680
There...

07:34.080 --> 07:36.360
And there...

07:37.990 --> 07:40.090
- ...and there—
- God help me.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.190
( bangs table )

07:45.590 --> 07:48.470
- There...
- God help me.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.570
There!

07:50.600 --> 07:53.410
What if I drove her into this?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.280
She was so mad at me.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.620
Why didn't I stop her?

08:24.830 --> 08:26.940
( door slams )

08:39.750 --> 08:42.250
He didn't do it, did he?

08:43.919 --> 08:46.590
Send him home.

08:48.690 --> 08:52.070
Been a long time since
I've been out of the city.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.230
I got that cough-- That downtown cough.

08:55.260 --> 08:58.250
I thought I'd go see my ex in Poughkeepsie.

08:58.270 --> 09:01.010
$10,000 can take you
a little farther than that.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.180
No, not just stop there.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.850
She and I always talked about going to Maine.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.950
So I'm thinking with this money,

09:07.980 --> 09:10.010
this could be a second chance for us.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.180
You're looking to relocate. Good.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.890
It's just that I hate to leave my sister.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.200
You mention any of this to her? Any of this?

09:19.220 --> 09:21.930
I didn't want her involved.

09:22.990 --> 09:25.130
Good.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.940
I want to see you get on that bus, Ricky.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.890
I examined a tissue sample
from your corpse.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.050
If there's something in the ground water,

09:49.080 --> 09:51.220
the tissue would pick it up, too.

09:51.250 --> 09:55.220
Transdichloroethylene. Xylenes. Ethylbenzene.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.530
Industrial waste leakage.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.060
My first thought was the neighborhood
around the Fresh Kills landfill.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.240
It's a long drive from Staten Island
to the Bronx with a body in the trunk.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.580
With all the spot checks since 9111--

10:06.600 --> 10:08.910
There are private dumps in the Bronx.

10:08.940 --> 10:14.290
Places where construction companies
unload waste, no questions asked.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.020
The smell, some days, just awful.

10:19.050 --> 10:22.260
We tried to shut them down, but City
Hall doesn't care about the Bronx.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.600
Seems so. We've been to six other
dumps in the Bronx already.

10:25.620 --> 10:29.760
Is there any other construction
starting up, or maybe a swimming pool?

10:29.790 --> 10:32.270
A swimming pool, that would be nice.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.300
The heat in the summer here will kill you.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.400
Oh-- there's an office complex.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.740
They're building offices? Where?

10:38.770 --> 10:40.910
Juniper and Second.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.140
Some geniuses think companies want to move

10:43.170 --> 10:45.450
out of downtown to the
Bronx because it's safer,

10:45.470 --> 10:49.290
because of the tragedy.
I'll believe it when I see it.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.550
Thank you very much.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.790
Woman: They bought these houses here.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.130
The Marinos', the Dougans',

10:59.150 --> 11:02.230
and then Sue Morrissey's across the street.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.240
She just died, God rest her
soul, a week ago Monday.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.470
Is anyone else living there?

11:07.500 --> 11:11.070
- No.
- Thank you for your time, Mrs. Gambi.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.610
You won't find anybody.
Everybody's gone but me.

11:23.780 --> 11:26.950
I'll go around back, see if there's
a way in through the garage.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.490
(chimes ring softly)

11:34.420 --> 11:36.560
( bangs )

11:58.810 --> 12:00.920
Down here!

12:09.120 --> 12:11.260
You find something?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.330
Yeah, it's a grave.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.620
There was a body in my parents'
house that whole time?

12:27.640 --> 12:30.050
That's unbelievable.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.330
20 years ago, I was living there
with my mother and father.

12:35.350 --> 12:37.850
Did you know a girl named Alyssa Cooney?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.960
I didn't.

12:39.990 --> 12:43.900
I don't know if my parents did.
They're both dead now.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.000
Did anyone else live there in 1983? Maybe
your parents had tenants.

12:47.030 --> 12:50.480
- No, no.
- ( cell phone ringing )

12:50.500 --> 12:52.710
Excuse me.

12:52.730 --> 12:57.310
How about the neighbors?
Any of them have access to the house?

12:57.340 --> 13:00.750
I remember that Easter, Mom and Dad
took me to Florida for a week.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.550
Mrs. Gambi across the street,
she was watering the plants.

13:03.580 --> 13:07.530
- She live with any other family?
- Her husband.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.590
Maybe someone broke in while we were gone.

13:10.620 --> 13:14.730
Mrs. Colton, do you know
a Richard Morrissey?

13:15.960 --> 13:18.440
Oh, Ricky's my brother. Why?

13:20.130 --> 13:23.080
His fingerprints
were found at your parents' home.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.640
They were recent.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.480
Yes, of course. He was there for the wake.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.790
When we asked...

13:35.810 --> 13:39.420
Who else lived in the house,
you didn't mention him.

13:42.150 --> 13:46.100
You said, "20 years ago."
He was living in the city then.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.000
He was at Hudson University.
That's why I got confused.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.300
He's been in trouble before.
It came up with his prints.

13:55.330 --> 13:58.330
Mostly drug-related offenses.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.070
That was just stupid mistakes.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.580
That's nothing like
what you're talking about now.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.520
Anyway, he's been to clinics.
He's cleaned up his drug problems.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.020
We still need to talk to him.

14:09.440 --> 14:12.290
He changes addresses a lot.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.130
Well, how about those drug
clinics you mentioned?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.430
Yeah, that clinic
should update its files.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.770
Morrissey hasn't lived here
in almost a year.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.600
Guy was a deadbeat.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.940
Landlord had to get
a court order to lock him out.

14:30.970 --> 14:35.040
- Has he been back since?
- Why would he come back?

14:35.070 --> 14:38.280
To get the stuff you kept
when you locked him out.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.150
Next time, when you're going to lie,

14:41.180 --> 14:43.780
don't answer a question with a question.

14:43.810 --> 14:46.450
We got rid of his stuff. We sold it.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.960
You would have needed
a court order for that, too.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.990
Can we see it?

14:52.150 --> 14:53.790
Look, one more thing.

14:53.820 --> 14:57.290
If you're going to tell a lie,
make sure you can back it up.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.500
I think I know what happened here.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.730
Me, too. Morrissey came back for his stuff,

15:01.760 --> 15:03.900
he gave you some money,
and you didn't tell the landlord.

15:03.930 --> 15:06.570
Which, by the way, is none of our business.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.710
Okay, okay. He came back a couple of days ago,

15:08.740 --> 15:10.150
paid what he owed-- $3 grand.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.380
$3 grand, cash? Yeah. He looked pretty flush.

15:13.410 --> 15:15.510
You get a current address out of him?

15:15.540 --> 15:19.080
No. All he took was his wedding
pictures, left the rest of his junk.

15:19.110 --> 15:21.090
Said he was going out of town for a while.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.100
- He has a wife?
- Ex-wife.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.430
In Poughkeepsie. Maureen.

15:25.450 --> 15:28.300
That woman ran circles around the poor guy.

15:33.730 --> 15:37.610
I haven't seen Ricky in years.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

15:37.630 --> 15:41.050
We heard he was heading this way with
your wedding album under his arm.

15:41.070 --> 15:45.950
Oh, please. You're making me want to cry.

15:45.970 --> 15:49.180
I'm starting to see why the
two of you didn't work out.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.350
It's too bad he came into all that money.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.950
( car horn blares )

15:52.980 --> 15:55.790
So I got lousy taste. I got to go.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.630
Ricky's luck was a little better.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.220
Kind of money he's got now,
he should be able to step up

16:00.260 --> 16:02.740
from a burned-out housewife
with a faux mink jacket.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.960
That shows how much you know.

16:04.990 --> 16:08.240
This is sable. $2,400 at Draper's.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.180
Where'd you come by it,
off the back of a truck?

16:11.200 --> 16:14.340
Fine.

16:14.370 --> 16:18.080
Ricky was here. He bought this for me.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.210
Goren: How'd you get him to do that?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.690
Did you get him drunk?

16:26.010 --> 16:28.360
Is that what you did?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.590
You got him drunk, and
you took all his money.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.730
He owed me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.930
All the time we were married,

16:35.960 --> 16:38.870
me working like a dog waiting tables,
he was putting it up his arm.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.840
How much did you take him for?

16:45.970 --> 16:48.110
$6 grand and change.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.580
I dumped him back at the bus station.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.090
Ricky: Jay, hey! Over here.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.390
I was surprised to hear from you.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.230
I know, I know.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.569
It's just the main plan fell through.

17:10.589 --> 17:13.160
You want to grab a beer?

17:13.190 --> 17:17.670
What I've been through, I got to
be honest, I could use a beer.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.910
You can't stay in the city.
We talked about this.

17:20.940 --> 17:24.349
Yeah, but I'm thinking,
where am I going to go?

17:24.369 --> 17:27.050
I don't know anybody anyplace else.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.920
Here, at least I got my sister.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.750
I mean it, Rick. Okay.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.920
The thing is, if you can
lend me a couple of bucks?

17:35.950 --> 17:39.800
Not a whole other 10, just to tide me over.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.400
Call me at the office on Friday.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.310
Use a pay phone.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.940
What’s this?

17:52.970 --> 17:55.950
Junk Morrissey left behind
at his apartment.

17:55.970 --> 18:00.420
Newsletter from the Hudson
University Chess Club, 1983.

18:01.410 --> 18:04.050
Morrissey's chess record. He's 0 for 12.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.420
Deakins: Receipts from a blood bank.

18:06.450 --> 18:09.160
Eames: He didn't make $10
grand selling plasma.

18:09.180 --> 18:11.060
I want it covered anyway.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.070
This is from his sister...

18:13.090 --> 18:15.570
"Since you always hang up on me
and don't come home anymore,

18:15.590 --> 18:17.730
so here I am writing you.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.830
I just wanted to say
I don't blame you, Ricky.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.930
It wasn't your fault.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.100
Please, please, please call me."

18:27.940 --> 18:29.970
This is March, 1983.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.350
That's a month before
Alyssa Cooney disappeared.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.750
Morrissey was the only son--
"Mom's favorite,"

18:40.780 --> 18:43.420
until something happened.

18:43.450 --> 18:47.330
Something that kept him from going home.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.770
Too bad that something wasn't
a truck running him over.

18:49.790 --> 18:53.360
Surveillance just called. We got a winner.

18:53.390 --> 18:55.930
You just can't stay. There
were cops here looking for you.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.140
Did you know that?

18:58.170 --> 19:00.480
Cops? It's nothing.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.210
Look, Sally, it's just till Friday.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.380
You won't even know.
I'll sleep in the rec room.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.750
- Ricky--
- ( doorbell rings )

19:12.410 --> 19:14.720
(sharp whisper)
Sally--!

19:14.750 --> 19:16.750
Wait.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.620
Aw, jeez.

19:22.660 --> 19:26.630
Rick Morrissey? You're under arrest.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.010
- Ricky: No! Sally!
- Don't hurt him!

19:29.030 --> 19:31.640
I didn't do anything.
I don't know anything.

19:31.670 --> 19:35.170
- This is a mistake.
- Eames: Story of your life, Ricky.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
I don't know. I don't know if I need a lawyer.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.780
What do you guys think?

19:44.810 --> 19:47.050
That's up to you. We can't
tell you one way or the other.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.720
Yeah, but if I get one,
then you guys are going to think--

19:49.750 --> 19:51.890
oh, man, maybe I better.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.900
He really can't make up his mind.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.900
I know it's important, but I-- don't know.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.240
While you're thinking about it,

19:59.260 --> 20:03.000
why don't we talk about this
body in your mother's basement?

20:03.030 --> 20:06.170
There's no body in my mom's basement.
That's crazy.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.270
There's no body anymore because you moved it.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.440
No. No.

20:10.470 --> 20:14.440
Hey, I just thought, can I talk to
my sister about this lawyer thing?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.580
No. Did you ever borrow her car?

20:16.610 --> 20:18.720
She lent you $10 grand. Maybe
she lent you her car.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.750
No. That money, see,

20:20.780 --> 20:22.960
I got that from selling my mom's house.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.730
That's the story you're going with?

20:25.750 --> 20:29.360
Yeah. My mom wanted me to have that house.
She cared about me.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.560
You loved your mother. You depended on her.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.700
Yeah, for sure. She was my mom.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.940
You wouldn't do anything to
disrespect her, disrespect her house?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.840
No.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.040
Like burying a body in the basement?

20:40.070 --> 20:43.210
No. See, that's my point.
It's crazy. I wouldn't do it.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.450
- It was somebody else' idea.
- Yeah, it was.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.320
- You just helped.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.120
- No, no. No, no, no.
- After the fact, Ricky.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.680
Because, like you said,
it was somebody else's idea.

20:53.720 --> 20:59.220
Yeah, yeah, I said that
because it wasn't mine.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.500
This is Mr. Morrissey's lawyer.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.510
He didn't ask for a lawyer.
But his sister did.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.870
You be quiet.

21:08.900 --> 21:13.040
He's invoking his right to
be silent. Now, scoot.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.080
Carver: His sister made his bail?

21:21.110 --> 21:24.920
If Mr. Morrissey turns up
at trial, I'll eat my hat.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.480
He's not the one we need to worry about.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.050
The girl wasn't killed in a frenzy.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.930
The wounds were deliberately
and carefully applied.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.770
The body was methodically
wrapped in a plastic tarp.

21:36.790 --> 21:39.600
The crime required organized thinking,

21:39.630 --> 21:43.230
decision-making Morrissey
isn't capable of either.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.470
You're saying there's an accomplice?

21:45.500 --> 21:47.710
A "Leopold" to Morrissey's "Loeb"?

21:47.740 --> 21:50.740
Well, half a Loeb.
The half Morrissey didn't fry on drugs.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.480
Did you mention he was
in his university chess club?

21:53.510 --> 21:56.280
With an 0-and-12 record.

21:56.310 --> 21:59.380
Please find this accomplice.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.690
Do you know how long it's been since
I've even looked at a chessboard?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.930
You edited the club newsletter.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.230
Oh, back them, chess was life.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.070
My brother had Frazier-Ali,
I had Fischer-Spassky.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.900
Do you remember a Rick Morrissey?

22:12.930 --> 22:15.410
He was a member of the club. This guy here.

22:15.430 --> 22:18.840
Oh, yeah, Ricky. Sort of
cute, but he had no game.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.640
I saw in later editions of your newsletter

22:21.670 --> 22:24.480
that his playing improved.
Did someone give him lessons?

22:24.510 --> 22:27.110
I don't know. Ricky never really fit in.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.620
I think people thought
he was a little strange.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.720
He was too strange for the chess club?

22:31.750 --> 22:33.750
That must be some kind of record.

22:33.780 --> 22:36.520
How about this guy?

22:37.520 --> 22:40.760
He spent his freshman year building
a computer that plays chess.

22:40.790 --> 22:43.100
In 1982, that's no small feat.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.500
Lippman. Brilliant player. Complete snob.

22:46.530 --> 22:49.410
But if anyone could teach
Morrissey anything, it was him.

22:49.430 --> 22:52.500
Excuse me. No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me.

22:52.530 --> 22:55.170
"Building a machine that truly thinks

22:55.200 --> 22:57.880
isn't playing God, it's being God."

22:57.910 --> 23:00.220
This is going to be fun.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.780
It took me two years to program.

23:03.810 --> 23:06.550
Only a month to beat.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.890
Was it as much fun
as teaching Rick Morrissey?

23:08.920 --> 23:12.130
- What makes you think —
- We talked to a few people in the club.

23:12.150 --> 23:14.290
They thought maybe you had.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.240
What they said actually was, if anyone
could've taught him, it would've been you.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.570
I think they meant it as a compliment.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.580
Sure, I gave him a few lessons.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.580
The other members of the club

23:24.600 --> 23:27.080
were having too much fun beating him.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.240
Well, then watching them
get beat by Morrissey,

23:30.270 --> 23:32.880
that must've made it
all the more pleasurable.

23:39.350 --> 23:42.090
I bet he was a better student
than this computer.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.360
I mean, it can't learn from its mistakes.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.090
Neither could Morrissey.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.830
That's another difference
between men and machines.

23:53.860 --> 23:57.780
You can only teach someone
as much as they want to learn.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.580
( softly )
After a while, Morrissey lost
interest in the club.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.240
Did you stay in touch with him?

24:03.270 --> 24:06.340
No. I never saw him on campus.

24:06.370 --> 24:08.450
( near-whisper )
I think he dropped out.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.790
You know anybody else
who was friends with him?

24:10.810 --> 24:15.260
No, and I wasn't friends with him.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.790
I like how you did that.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.530
Make me cross the room
by keeping your voice down.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.700
It wasn't deliberate.

24:27.730 --> 24:32.200
Come on. It's the classic "Sicilian
gambit" to get me to the door.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.940
We're done, anyway.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.110
Thank you for seeing us.

24:42.110 --> 24:44.110
By the way...

24:46.110 --> 24:49.620
You don't want to know why
we're asking about Morrissey?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.860
I can only imagine he's in trouble.

24:53.890 --> 24:57.960
I really don't care.
I'm sorry I can't help you.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.970
He was having a ball
moving me around the room.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.070
So he's a control freak. What else?

25:05.100 --> 25:08.600
He has no record, not even a speeding
ticket, and we went back 20 years.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.880
House in Westchester, wife, two kids.

25:10.910 --> 25:15.050
He's been a partner in an engineering
firm for the last 15 years.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.890
You need to put him with Morrissey
for something besides a chess game.

25:18.910 --> 25:21.220
Where did these guys live
when they went to Hudson?

25:21.250 --> 25:25.250
Morrissey was in a room on Mott
Street, Lippman was in a dorm.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.760
He have a roommate?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.240
Man: Jay had a lot of theories about women--

25:35.260 --> 25:37.900
they want this, they don't want that.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.110
I doubt it was based on
any actual field work.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.880
He never had a date?
Remember, this is the '80s.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.680
There was a lot of "pharmaceutical
experimentation" going on.

25:45.710 --> 25:49.090
One night, Lippman started
asking about Quaaludes.

25:49.110 --> 25:52.580
He says he needs some, because he's got
some chick who's hot to party with him.

25:52.610 --> 25:55.090
- Eames: You know who she was?
- No. Some high school chick.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.120
- When was this?
- Right before spring break.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.530
So you helped him out?

26:00.560 --> 26:04.870
Look, a couple of 'ludes.
Girl likes to party, why not?

26:04.890 --> 26:07.300
Hey, I don't think he ever closed the deal.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.870
He would've told me about it.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.400
Okay. Thanks.

26:13.430 --> 26:15.040
( cell phone ringing )

26:15.070 --> 26:19.040
Alyssa Cooney disappeared in April.
This doesn't fit.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.080
Eames.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.410
Jay: If you're going to stay in
the city, you'll need a job.

26:25.450 --> 26:29.050
I can introduce you to the foreman tomorrow.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.090
I don't know. I got a fear of heights.

26:33.420 --> 26:36.400
Jay: We're not that high.

26:36.420 --> 26:40.740
Come here. I want to show you something.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.110
Come on, Rick. Challenge
yourself once in a while.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.950
That's what you said that night.
"Challenge yourself."

27:01.480 --> 27:03.930
That was a long time ago.

27:07.660 --> 27:10.000
A couple of cops came by my office today,

27:10.020 --> 27:12.400
asking about you.

27:12.430 --> 27:15.070
I didn't tell them anything.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.170
You talked to them, though.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.640
And you didn't tell me, Rick, did you?

27:19.670 --> 27:22.710
Don't. Don't, Jay.

27:22.740 --> 27:27.380
'Cause I didn't. I would
never tell anything to anybody.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.720
I know you, Rick.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.750
Even after all this time,
you think I don't know you?

27:33.780 --> 27:39.060
No, I mean it. I didn't say anything.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.730
It's not so hard, Ricky.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.860
Just a step.

27:46.890 --> 27:50.430
No, no. Come on.

27:52.430 --> 27:55.110
Things just haven't
worked out for you, Rick.

27:55.140 --> 28:00.020
Your mom's dead. Your sister turned you in.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.210
( sobbing )
No-oo!

28:03.380 --> 28:05.880
No, she wouldn't--

28:08.880 --> 28:11.560
You must be tired of your life.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.390
Never feeling safe.

28:19.230 --> 28:22.070
Jay...?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.800
It's safety, Rick.

28:26.730 --> 28:29.580
Don't you want to be safe?

28:35.910 --> 28:38.050
Security guard came on duty at 8:00.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.420
The gate had been left open.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.230
Looks like a suicide.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.930
Oh, yeah? What, did he have
a note pinned to his chest?

29:02.200 --> 29:04.340
This is your fault.

29:04.370 --> 29:07.180
You accused him without any proof.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.550
He was scared.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.680
That's why he did this to himself.

29:12.710 --> 29:16.560
We don't think it was a suicide.
We think Ricky was murdered.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.760
What?

29:18.790 --> 29:21.030
Over drugs?

29:21.060 --> 29:23.160
Is that what he was doing in that place?

29:23.190 --> 29:27.610
Sally... do you remember Jay Lippman?

29:29.060 --> 29:32.170
He was Ricky's friend in college.
Ricky introduced you.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.700
No.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.040
In February, before spring break?

29:36.070 --> 29:38.380
No.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.680
Lippman got drugs from his roommate

29:40.710 --> 29:43.250
because he had a date...

29:44.580 --> 29:46.680
With a high school girl.

29:46.710 --> 29:49.390
You were 17?

29:49.420 --> 29:51.920
It wasn't me.

29:59.260 --> 30:03.330
"I don't blame you, Ricky.
it wasn't your fault.

30:03.360 --> 30:07.740
Please, please call me."
You wrote this in March.

30:07.770 --> 30:10.940
Your brother stopped coming home. Why?

30:16.080 --> 30:18.350
Lippman drugged you?

30:25.020 --> 30:26.620
(sighs)

30:27.620 --> 30:30.760
Ricky had been telling me
how smart Lippman was.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.270
So we went to his dorm room,

30:34.300 --> 30:36.800
just for a couple of beers.

30:36.830 --> 30:39.970
I started feeling woozy.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.310
I couldn't even stand up.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.220
And Lippman told Ricky

30:46.240 --> 30:48.780
to go down the hall
and get us some Cokes.

30:48.810 --> 30:50.980
Ricky did.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.380
It wasn't his fault.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.960
Eames: What happened?

31:01.320 --> 31:05.170
I was lying on the bed, just out of it.

31:06.330 --> 31:08.710
Lippman opened my shirt.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.800
He just looked at me.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.310
Looked at you how?

31:19.670 --> 31:22.480
sort of fascinated, I guess, but frozen.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.750
And then he started...

31:29.720 --> 31:32.860
...with one of the bottles.

31:33.850 --> 31:37.170
Then the next thing,
Ricky was banging on the door,

31:37.190 --> 31:41.040
and they were yelling, and then
Ricky got me out of the room.

31:43.530 --> 31:45.670
Thank you.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.370
I know this wasn't easy.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.510
One last thing.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.850
Do you know where
your brother got $10,000?

31:59.150 --> 32:01.290
Not from me.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.760
He would've spent it on drugs.

32:07.190 --> 32:10.130
Yes, my husband withdrew $10,000.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.430
It was an investment. So what?

32:12.460 --> 32:15.600
You have no business
snooping into our finances.

32:15.630 --> 32:17.800
We do have a warrant. And we were wondering

32:17.830 --> 32:21.800
why you have the bank call you
every time he takes out money.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.510
Goren: Is it because you
don't trust him anymore?

32:24.540 --> 32:28.650
Because he's had affairs in the past?

32:29.880 --> 32:32.150
I don't understand.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.820
What has any of this to do with the police?

32:34.850 --> 32:38.490
Your husband could have gotten
himself into serious trouble.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.230
So, please, just answer our questions.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.500
There was one affair.

32:48.530 --> 32:52.140
It was a very long time ago, in '92.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.010
It was very short-lived.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.170
- You know the woman?
- No.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.780
How did you find out about it?
Did he tell you?

33:00.810 --> 33:02.950
No.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.790
He'd been increasingly
unhappy, and he left.

33:05.810 --> 33:09.780
He was gone for a week, I don't know where.

33:09.820 --> 33:12.960
But when he came back, it was over.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.300
Things have been fine ever since.

33:15.320 --> 33:19.330
Before he left, what was his behavior like?

33:20.330 --> 33:23.970
Was he secretive? Impatient?

33:25.100 --> 33:27.810
I suppose, yes.

33:29.270 --> 33:32.410
And when he came back from being away,

33:32.440 --> 33:34.580
he was relaxed?

33:34.610 --> 33:38.180
- Why is this--
- He was apologetic--

33:38.210 --> 33:40.280
he brought you gifts?

33:41.620 --> 33:43.930
Yes.

33:43.950 --> 33:46.430
What did he bring you?

33:46.450 --> 33:48.590
A necklace.

33:48.620 --> 33:51.870
And these little black and
white cows for the children.

33:51.890 --> 33:54.840
The necklace, do you remember
what store it came from?

33:56.300 --> 33:58.540
The box said something like "Bernard's"

33:58.570 --> 34:00.700
or "Berger’s."

34:00.730 --> 34:03.210
I don't remember. Why are you asking me?

34:03.240 --> 34:05.840
It's all right, Mrs. Lippman.

34:05.870 --> 34:08.250
You've been very helpful.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.120
One more thing.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.560
If you want to tell
your husband we were here,

34:14.580 --> 34:16.960
by all means. We have no secrets from him.

34:16.980 --> 34:19.969
The more he knows, the better it is.

34:24.989 --> 34:27.100
Tell me exactly what you told them.

34:27.130 --> 34:30.070
That it was a stupid affair
a long time ago.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.480
This isn't about an affair!

34:32.500 --> 34:34.980
What is going on, Jay?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.010
"Be a good boy, keep a nice home."

34:40.010 --> 34:42.489
Everything's fine. You can handle it.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.820
Anne: Jay--

34:44.850 --> 34:47.190
I can handle it, Anne.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.460
This isn't a problem.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.860
It's going to be fine.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.900
We found a "Bernard's Jewelry"
in Montpelier, Vermont.

34:59.930 --> 35:02.130
That fits with the "Ben &
Jerry's" porcelain cows.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.270
So he took his mistress for
an ice cream cone in Vermont.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.840
How does this...?

35:07.870 --> 35:11.820
We sent the Cooney file to the Vermont
State Police. We're waiting to hear.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.050
Before he went to Vermont,
he gave every sign

35:14.070 --> 35:16.550
that he was heading
for a crisis, an eruption.

35:16.580 --> 35:19.320
By the time he came back,
the crisis was resolved.

35:19.350 --> 35:22.730
Simple explanation--
he broke up with his mistress.

35:22.750 --> 35:27.160
"Linda Messali. 21-year-old
prostitute found November, 1992,

35:27.190 --> 35:30.230
behind a service station
on Route 14 near Montpelier."

35:30.260 --> 35:32.570
Manner of death matched Alyssa Cooney's.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.600
Broken jaw, rope burns, suffocation,

35:34.630 --> 35:36.840
genital trauma, wrapped in plastic tarp.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.900
Her pimp was the prime suspect,

35:38.930 --> 35:41.110
but they never made the case stick.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.740
I don't know that we'll have better
luck sticking it on Mr. Lippman.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.750
Apparently, the forensic
evidence has been long gone.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.880
Oh, for crying out loud.

35:50.910 --> 35:54.720
You can't establish a connection
between Lippman and Morrissey's death,

35:54.750 --> 35:58.290
and Morrissey is the only person
to connect him to the Cooney girl.

36:03.390 --> 36:06.370
Well, forget about convicting him.

36:06.390 --> 36:08.870
Do we have enough to arrest him?

36:08.900 --> 36:11.570
Well, if you had the right judge.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.240
I know the right judge.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.280
My client is more than happy to cooperate

36:17.770 --> 36:19.910
with your investigation.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.550
But we can't understand
the basis for his arrest,

36:22.580 --> 36:24.720
or for his humiliating treatment.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.880
It's for his own protection.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.020
Jay?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.820
Here.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.940
Your lawyer tells us
that you want to cooperate.

36:47.070 --> 36:49.210
That's good.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.910
The first item,

36:51.940 --> 36:57.320
this incident with Rick Morrissey's
sister Sally.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.450
- What incident?
- Eames: She gave us a statement

36:59.480 --> 37:02.190
You drugged her and assaulted her in college.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.360
We're not going to talk about something

37:04.380 --> 37:07.520
the statute of limitations precludes
you from even prosecuting.

37:07.550 --> 37:10.730
If we can't prosecute you,
what's the harm in talking about it?

37:10.760 --> 37:13.830
We refuse to answer any questions
about it. End of story.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.030
I get it. Your lawyer's in charge,

37:17.060 --> 37:19.810
so we'll just talk to him.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.940
Goren: The sister's statement

37:26.970 --> 37:29.420
made it very clear

37:29.440 --> 37:31.920
your client and Morrissey were close friends

37:31.950 --> 37:35.090
in the spring of 1983.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.530
You're talking about
a statement I haven't even seen.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.620
- I'll answer their questions.
- Jay--

37:39.650 --> 37:43.100
I can talk to them. I have nothing to hide.

37:51.230 --> 37:55.480
Morrissey told me his sister
wanted a date with a college man.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.970
He said she liked doing drugs.

37:59.010 --> 38:01.320
I misunderstood her intentions.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.480
As soon as I realized my mistake,

38:03.510 --> 38:06.490
I stopped, the date ended,

38:06.510 --> 38:08.650
and Morrissey took her home.

38:08.680 --> 38:13.320
One of the interesting details
that Sally remembered

38:13.350 --> 38:17.320
is you were wearing boots. Frye boots.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.670
Interesting,

38:19.690 --> 38:22.570
because we found some old boot prints...

38:22.600 --> 38:26.510
In the basement where
Alyssa Cooney was buried.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.040
I can't see.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:32.370 --> 38:35.380
I didn't say you could touch that.
That's evidence.

38:37.740 --> 38:39.990
We went back over

38:40.010 --> 38:42.690
some of the old newsletters
from the chess club.

38:44.690 --> 38:48.530
We found a photo of you
that's very pertinent.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.800
I think it shows you wearing boots

38:51.830 --> 38:55.200
that might fit that imprint in the basement.

38:55.230 --> 38:57.770
See?

39:04.200 --> 39:06.340
Those aren't boots, those are loafers.

39:06.370 --> 39:09.050
I never wore boots, so you're wrong.

39:11.210 --> 39:13.850
But now you're sitting
where I want you to sit.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.190
Another thing Sally told us,

39:22.220 --> 39:25.570
is you tried to insert a bottle.

39:25.590 --> 39:27.660
That's categorically untrue.

39:27.690 --> 39:30.370
But significant, because it's consistent

39:30.400 --> 39:33.500
to what was done to Alyssa Cooney.

39:39.410 --> 39:42.720
It was Morrissey, right,
who picked up Alyssa,

39:42.740 --> 39:46.090
brought her back to you
to make up for taking Sally away?

39:48.150 --> 39:50.790
( whispering )
Your partner has the insane notion

39:50.820 --> 39:52.890
that I was Rick Morrissey's puppeteer.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.830
Nothing could be further from the truth.

39:57.290 --> 39:59.630
I don't know that Morrissey killed that girl,

39:59.660 --> 40:01.730
but if he did, he did it on his own.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.440
He was a very disturbed--

40:11.270 --> 40:13.340
Now I can hear you.

40:14.440 --> 40:18.790
And you can hear me.

40:22.280 --> 40:25.290
What was disturbing to you?

40:26.620 --> 40:30.190
Was it that Morrissey had
something that you didn't?

40:30.220 --> 40:32.290
Love that you never had?

40:32.330 --> 40:34.400
That's not true.

40:34.430 --> 40:36.570
Love...

40:39.970 --> 40:42.910
That you would do anything to get?

40:47.640 --> 40:51.990
I'll bet that you were
awkward with girls.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.790
You didn't know how to talk to them.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.320
They had their own ideas
about what they wanted.

40:57.350 --> 40:59.890
No, no.

40:59.920 --> 41:04.490
Your sexual gropings were infantile,
clumsy and unsatisfying.

41:04.520 --> 41:07.300
My client wants to return to his cell.

41:07.330 --> 41:12.330
To get this girl-- this love...

41:13.630 --> 41:17.010
You needed someone like Morrissey

41:17.040 --> 41:20.110
to offer up his sister.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.580
To bring you...

41:29.780 --> 41:32.200
Alyssa Cooney.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.730
You got it out of your system,

41:39.760 --> 41:42.100
and now you could get on with your life.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.400
You became an exemplary man,

41:44.430 --> 41:46.710
with a wife and a family, a home.

41:48.370 --> 41:50.870
And for a while, these needs, these thoughts,

41:50.900 --> 41:55.880
were kept... quiet inside you.

41:59.650 --> 42:03.960
But they came back, didn't they?

42:06.150 --> 42:09.290
And you surrendered to them.

42:14.190 --> 42:16.730
And you went north.

42:18.030 --> 42:20.170
(faint whimper)

42:21.170 --> 42:24.310
For 10 years, you held on.

42:25.510 --> 42:27.510
10 years!

42:28.510 --> 42:30.820
This took skill.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.980
It took control.

42:33.010 --> 42:37.660
It took... "grand mastery."

42:40.850 --> 42:44.200
That was the real feat, wasn't it?

42:50.360 --> 42:52.840
You have no idea.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.980
( sobbing )

43:31.340 --> 43:34.580
( theme music playing )
