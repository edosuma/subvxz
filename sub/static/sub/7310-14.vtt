WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.100
Housekeeping, Tony.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.100
Well, keep it to a dull roar, will
you? I got a hot beverage here.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.900
Keep it over there... please.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.800
Backing up three years of case files.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.100
The bulk of our lives is
in these cables right now,

00:22.200 --> 00:24.400
flying back and forth
in zeroes and ones.

00:24.500 --> 00:27.700
You do understand that I'm the
ones, and you're the zeroes.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.100
Meadowlark Lemon.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.300
- Harlem Globetrotters.
- What?

00:41.900 --> 00:44.700
Look at all this.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.300
Hey, careful with the liquids.
Please, I told you it's very sensitive.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
Well, so am I, McZero.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.600
What, you think I'm a complete klutz?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.800
- No, no, no, no!
- I might spill my...

00:59.500 --> 01:01.400
Curly Neal. That worked.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.099
Yeah. How about the phones?
They work? I've been calling.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.600
Actually, they do not.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.200
No, no, no.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.600
No! No, no, no, no!

01:11.400 --> 01:13.100
Well, the unit's getting power,

01:13.400 --> 01:16.300
but the line tone's gone. Must
be a problem with the router.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.800
It's not my fault.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.000
I didn't do this.

01:19.100 --> 01:19.900
Freeze.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.200
No need for that.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.265
Tobias.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.300
- What's going on?
- It's a shutdown, Gibbs.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.700
Few months ago, they pulled
a body out of the bay.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.800
P.D.'s had him on ice while they
were tracking down a DNA match.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.300
Yeah? And?

01:32.900 --> 01:35.200
Body's been positively
identified as Rene Benoit.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
La Grenouille.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.500
He's dead?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
Murdered.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.700
This entire unit is under investigation.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.100
This is ridiculous.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.400
We're prisoners in our
own evidence lock-up.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.100
We're not prisoners.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.100
We're evidence, so we're locked up.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.100
Well, why are we being guarded then?
I mean, we are being guarded, right?

02:30.200 --> 02:31.750
You are being very guarded about

02:31.785 --> 02:33.265
whether or not we are being guarded.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.500
Abby, relax. I'm sure
you're not a suspect.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.400
Well, then, who is their suspect?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.365
The FBI is not ready

02:39.400 --> 02:41.600
to walk anyone out in handcuffs.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.300
They're trying to keep it quiet.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
They don't even know
what they're looking for.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.500
So what? We're supposed to
just hand them their first clue?

02:48.800 --> 02:51.000
Not us. Gibbs.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.400
How did you land this job, Tobias?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.900
Intimate knowledge of the case
history made me the obvious choice.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.800
And your personal relationships
with the people involved?

03:00.100 --> 03:01.600
Not gonna be a problem.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.300
Evidence led to somebody
in this building.

03:05.700 --> 03:06.800
What evidence?

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
Other side.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Sir?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.000
I don't drink coffee.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.400
Don't seem too shocked.
Grenouille is dead.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.500
- Knew it wasn't over.
- Hoped it was?

03:49.500 --> 03:52.200
We have determined that you and
your team had significant contact

03:52.235 --> 03:53.235
with Grenouille

03:53.300 --> 03:54.500
on the day he died.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.800
That morning, there was an
earlier attempt on his life.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.500
He wasn't the target. His daughter was.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.700
Somebody was taking things personally.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
You ever figure out
who that somebody was?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
No.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.365
Final entry in your
official report has you,

04:15.400 --> 04:19.399
McGee and David raiding a yacht where
Grenouille was thought to be staying.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.400
- Yeah, we just missed him.
- Did you?

04:23.400 --> 04:27.100
'Cause the time of death roughly
coincides with your visit.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.400
Ziva, McGee, and I were here
all night securing a warrant.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.000
I'm sure their reports
will verify the timeline.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.600
Is it my alibi you're after, Tobias?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.800
Before that, I was at
the Director's house.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.400
With Jenny Shepard?

04:48.600 --> 04:49.700
And the deceased?

04:54.500 --> 04:57.600
Her phone records put them
in contact the night he died.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.800
Were you part of their little chat?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.100
So here we are at last.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.000
Face to face.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.100
You believe the story that
my father took a bribe?

05:07.135 --> 05:09.200
Sorry, that's not a
story, that's a fact.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.600
Because I paid him.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.500
No.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.100
You killed him.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
He left.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.800
- I left.
- Come on, Jethro.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.600
Can't be that simple.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.665
What the hell were you all doing there?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.300
- He wanted protection.
- Maybe you should have provided it.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.600
Are you protecting anybody now?

05:34.600 --> 05:38.000
I have been trying for a
decade to bring him down.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.500
What did he do to you, Jenny?

05:44.200 --> 05:46.200
It's not my alibi you're after.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.900
Can you account for the
director's where abouts and actions

05:49.935 --> 05:52.200
after you left her residence that night?

05:52.700 --> 05:53.700
No.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.400
You killed him.

05:55.700 --> 05:56.800
It's not loaded.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.400
If the weapon was loaded and I wasn't
here, would you have pulled the trigger?

06:01.700 --> 06:03.200
I guess we'll never know.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.300
You're going to accuse the
Director of NCIS of murder,

06:08.400 --> 06:10.000
that evidence better be damn good.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.900
Do you think I'd be here if it weren't?

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
We both know

06:14.300 --> 06:17.300
that her connection to Grenouille had
nothing to do with the job. Never did.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.600
This might have been her mess to begin,
but she spread it all over this place.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.000
When this is done, and she's cleared,

06:24.500 --> 06:26.000
I want to see that file.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.300
When this is done, if she's cleared...

06:33.000 --> 06:34.300
I just might let you.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.000
Take him back down.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.800
Long way from San Diego, Leon.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.100
Secnav felt this
warranted a plane ticket.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.300
You're interrogating my agents?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.100
I assume you have a suspect.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.800
And you've been brought in to oversee.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.700
Well, Assistant Director Vance,

07:19.200 --> 07:20.700
you gonna ask for 'em?

07:35.900 --> 07:38.400
Under the authority of
the Secretary of the Navy,

07:38.600 --> 07:40.700
as Acting Director of NCIS,

07:41.300 --> 07:43.300
I hereby relieve you of your duties.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.300
I'm sorry, Jenny, you're suspended.

08:02.719 --> 08:03.819
Hello, Leon.

08:04.019 --> 08:05.019
Gibbs.

08:09.919 --> 08:11.619
$2.42.

08:12.019 --> 08:13.519
It's for the cheese Danish.

08:13.819 --> 08:15.019
That was eight years ago.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.119
Nine.

08:17.519 --> 08:20.119
Are you the one responsible
for this fishing expedition?

08:20.319 --> 08:21.919
The Bureau's doing the fishing.

08:22.019 --> 08:23.419
I'm just driving the boat.

08:26.919 --> 08:28.119
Keep it off the rocks.

08:34.619 --> 08:35.719
What do I say?

08:36.318 --> 08:37.619
The truth, McGee.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.419
You haven't done anything wrong.

08:40.818 --> 08:42.719
It's a
get-out-of-jail-free card.

08:43.019 --> 08:45.019
You're going to hack into the CIA.

08:45.119 --> 08:48.219
This is highly illegal, and
I'm not even doing it now.

08:51.319 --> 08:52.619
You look nervous, McGee.

08:52.819 --> 08:54.919
Where's your head at? What
were you thinking about?

08:56.919 --> 08:57.919
Nothing.

09:01.119 --> 09:02.119
I know

09:03.319 --> 09:06.619
you've hacked into everything from
the corner store to the CIA, McGee.

09:09.219 --> 09:10.519
I don't care.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.819
Jasper Shepard.

09:13.919 --> 09:14.919
Director's father.

09:15.719 --> 09:18.019
She asked you to investigate
the details of his suicide?

09:18.819 --> 09:19.619
No.

09:19.819 --> 09:21.919
You didn't come up with
the idea on your own, McGee.

09:25.219 --> 09:26.219
Gibbs.

09:29.119 --> 09:31.919
The Director was particularly aggressive

09:32.719 --> 09:36.019
in her pursuit of the arms
dealer La Grenouille. Agent Gibbs

09:37.119 --> 09:39.419
was curious as to her motivation.

09:39.619 --> 09:41.419
Gibbs doesn't get curious.

09:42.419 --> 09:43.919
He gets suspicious.

09:44.119 --> 09:45.519
What did he suspect?

09:48.619 --> 09:49.619
That...

09:50.419 --> 09:54.219
that she believed La Grenouille was
responsible for her father's death.

09:54.819 --> 09:57.019
Is that why she put
Agent DiNozzo undercover?

09:57.419 --> 09:58.719
To get close to him?

10:01.119 --> 10:04.119
I can't speak to the nature
of Agent DiNozzo's assignment.

10:04.319 --> 10:05.319
Why not?

10:06.719 --> 10:07.919
You two do have

10:08.319 --> 10:09.819
a professional relationship?

10:11.619 --> 10:14.019
McGeek... McGoo...
McGiggle... McGoogle...

10:17.419 --> 10:18.419
Yeah.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.919
Yeah, it's...

10:20.819 --> 10:23.619
- very professional, yeah.
- Then tell me about his assignment.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.734
This is not the time to be
covering for your friends.

10:28.219 --> 10:31.019
I was not privy to any of his actions,

10:31.119 --> 10:34.519
vis-à-vis the aforementioned
undercover operation

10:35.519 --> 10:37.019
as previously stated.

10:38.219 --> 10:40.119
- In perpetuity.
- Sure you were privy.

10:41.819 --> 10:43.319
On at least one occasion,

10:44.219 --> 10:46.319
you were directly involved
in his investigation.

10:47.619 --> 10:50.719
Southeastern Quebec. T.O.D. 2400.

10:50.819 --> 10:52.219
Where's Grenouille?

10:52.419 --> 10:53.419
Finally...

10:55.019 --> 10:56.019
Canada?

10:57.019 --> 10:58.619
What was the purpose of the mission?

11:02.519 --> 11:03.719
Officer David...

11:04.619 --> 11:05.819
I know you're Israeli.

11:06.519 --> 11:08.819
I know you were trained by Mossad to...

11:11.719 --> 11:12.919
We know what you do.

11:13.419 --> 11:15.119
I would hate to be misunderstood.

11:15.319 --> 11:16.819
Does that happen often?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.519
Once in a blue lagoon.

11:19.619 --> 11:21.619
I think I'll be able to
translate. I'll repeat.

11:21.919 --> 11:24.219
What was the purpose of
the mission to Canada?

11:26.319 --> 11:29.319
We received intelligence that the
subject would be in the vicinity.

11:29.619 --> 11:33.119
Were you attempting to apprehend
this subject who is now deceased?

11:34.519 --> 11:36.019
Archangel has him covered.

11:37.719 --> 11:38.519
No.

11:38.719 --> 11:41.119
Then why were you there?
What were your orders?

11:42.719 --> 11:44.919
Archangel awaiting instructions.

11:48.819 --> 11:50.219
You were there to kill him.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.219
That's what you do.

11:52.619 --> 11:54.619
I was there to ensure mission safety.

11:55.019 --> 11:56.884
I was never given a fire order.

11:56.919 --> 11:59.219
Only because you were called
off at the last moment.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.219
By a deep undercover CIA
agent named Trent Kort.

12:05.419 --> 12:07.819
- Director Shepard.
- We're about to lose target.

12:07.854 --> 12:10.219
- Director...
- Stand down, Archangel. Stand down.

12:12.019 --> 12:13.619
Now, that must have been a shock?

12:14.119 --> 12:17.319
To discover that Grenouille
was being handled by the CIA?

12:18.019 --> 12:19.019
Regardless.

12:19.119 --> 12:22.319
Director Shepard manufactured the
entire mission to get close to him.

12:22.619 --> 12:23.619
Why?

12:24.619 --> 12:26.019
To put a bullet in his head.

12:30.919 --> 12:32.619
We met only once.

12:34.619 --> 12:37.319
But I was rather taken by the man.

12:37.619 --> 12:39.219
Dredged out of Baltimore Harbor.

12:39.519 --> 12:40.919
Dead less than two days.

12:41.319 --> 12:43.819
Maryland M.E. performed the autopsy?

12:44.219 --> 12:45.419
She's very good.

12:46.119 --> 12:48.719
- I would like to see the body.
- No.

12:49.119 --> 12:50.819
Four eyes are better than two.

12:50.919 --> 12:52.919
No. Cause of death
wasn't much of a mystery.

12:53.019 --> 12:54.619
A single gunshot wound to the head.

12:54.819 --> 12:56.319
Then what do you want from me?

12:56.919 --> 12:58.619
From time to time you compile

12:58.819 --> 13:01.419
psychological profiles
on persons of interest.

13:01.619 --> 13:05.519
Well, following my
encounter with La Grenouille,

13:05.919 --> 13:07.519
I was asked for my opinion.

13:08.219 --> 13:10.719
La Grenouille is not
your ordinary arms dealer.

13:10.919 --> 13:13.919
He's not the type to settle
disputes with violence.

13:14.219 --> 13:15.519
You liked him, didn't you?

13:15.619 --> 13:17.819
Perhaps it's clouding your judgment.

13:17.919 --> 13:20.719
Perhaps it's not my judgment
that's being clouded.

13:21.819 --> 13:22.819
Yes,

13:23.019 --> 13:24.419
by the Director herself.

13:26.119 --> 13:28.119
I'd like to know your
opinion of that encounter.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.619
Dr. Mallard?

13:34.519 --> 13:36.319
There was a history between those two.

13:36.619 --> 13:38.719
Something that is consuming her.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.819
- How far?
- Will she go? As far as it takes.

13:42.919 --> 13:43.919
She did

13:44.219 --> 13:46.719
manifest obsessive behavior.

13:47.719 --> 13:49.419
He's trying to paint a picture.

13:49.619 --> 13:53.619
A comprehensive picture of her need
for retribution against La Grenouille.

13:53.719 --> 13:56.019
He's just confirming
what he knows, Duck.

13:56.119 --> 13:58.019
He's holding something back.

13:59.119 --> 14:00.419
Do you think

14:00.719 --> 14:02.019
she could have done it?

14:03.219 --> 14:06.019
I will get him, another
time, another deal.

14:06.119 --> 14:08.319
I will be there, and I will get him.

14:14.419 --> 14:16.119
I'm sorry, sir. You can't leave.

14:17.219 --> 14:18.419
You know what?

14:19.419 --> 14:20.819
You're going to have to stop me.

14:25.019 --> 14:27.319
- Problem?
- If you want it to be.

14:28.019 --> 14:29.784
I know it's always
been lost on you, Gibbs,

14:29.819 --> 14:32.319
- but they write the rules for a reason.
- I have rules, too.

14:32.419 --> 14:33.419
So I hear.

14:35.019 --> 14:37.219
Any reason to keep us here, Leon?

14:37.619 --> 14:41.119
I'm well aware of your
relationship with Director Shepard.

14:41.919 --> 14:45.219
Never been comfortable with intimacy
between management and staff myself.

14:45.819 --> 14:46.819
Me either.

14:49.419 --> 14:52.219
If you've been interviewed by
Agent Fornell, you're free to go.

14:53.019 --> 14:54.419
Just to be clear...

14:55.619 --> 14:57.519
do not investigate this case.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.569
That guy! He just, like,
puts on a fancy suit and

15:06.604 --> 15:09.019
expects everyone to
do everything he says.

15:09.119 --> 15:10.619
It is a pretty nice suit.

15:10.819 --> 15:12.319
Come on, let's go. Work to do.

15:12.619 --> 15:13.819
On what?

15:13.919 --> 15:16.019
We can't investigate the FBI's case.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.719
We investigate the FBI.

15:29.912 --> 15:33.512
Boss... Ziva's shaking the FBI tail
car. Got 'em running into circles.

15:33.612 --> 15:36.612
Good. When she gets here, she can
help you hack into Fornell's computer.

15:36.712 --> 15:39.812
I'm going to need to go to a public
site. They've quarantined all my...

15:43.212 --> 15:44.712
Here, use mine.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.812
But this doesn't have a
wireless signal, though.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.112
- I'll figure it out.
- Duck.

15:54.712 --> 15:56.712
Your friend in the
Maryland M.E.'s office.

15:56.812 --> 15:57.812
Dr. Hampton?

15:57.912 --> 15:59.312
Need that autopsy report.

15:59.512 --> 16:02.112
- I'll have to be charming.
- Don't strain yourself.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.212
Go out the back, through the hedge.

16:04.412 --> 16:07.412
It's all very exciting, isn't
it? Like a cat and mouse game.

16:08.812 --> 16:10.112
Reminds me of...

16:10.912 --> 16:13.512
a part of my life that
I will share with you later.

16:13.912 --> 16:14.912
Boss.

16:15.112 --> 16:17.662
I may be able to hook up my
phone and piggyback the signal.

16:17.697 --> 16:20.212
But I'm going to need an I.D.
to get access to the FBI main...

16:20.247 --> 16:21.247
frame.

16:21.912 --> 16:22.912
Questions?

16:23.612 --> 16:25.512
Yeah, how do you get the boat out?

16:25.912 --> 16:27.012
Just break the bottle.

16:41.012 --> 16:44.212
You wouldn't be breaking the chain
of evidence, now, would you, Abby?

16:44.412 --> 16:45.712
On the Portman file?

16:45.812 --> 16:47.912
Doubt it. He died in
prison two years ago.

16:48.512 --> 16:51.512
Let me know if you've got something
to eat in there, 'cause I'm starving.

16:51.547 --> 16:52.547
How starving?

16:57.012 --> 16:58.512
Klowny Kakes.

16:58.912 --> 17:00.212
Tarot cards.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.712
Want to see what happens next?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.512
I am dying with anticipation.

17:08.811 --> 17:09.912
Tony!

17:10.412 --> 17:13.811
We're about to summon the
elusive elements of the cosmos.

17:14.212 --> 17:15.212
Concentrate.

17:15.712 --> 17:17.811
I'm with you. Call the spirits.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.412
Tell them to bring pizza.

17:27.612 --> 17:29.012
Not yet, DiNozzo.

17:32.912 --> 17:34.362
Gibbs gave you a mission.

17:34.397 --> 17:36.154
Everybody's counting on you.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.912
Just do what you do best.

17:39.212 --> 17:41.112
- Dance?
- Talk.

17:42.212 --> 17:43.412
Ms. Sciuto.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.312
Mighty generous.

18:18.312 --> 18:20.832
I've gone over your results with
regard to the case in question.

18:20.912 --> 18:23.212
There's a problem with
your theory of the crime.

18:23.412 --> 18:24.612
A big hole.

18:24.912 --> 18:26.712
I could drive a truck through it. Well,

18:26.812 --> 18:29.277
I may not be able to
drive a truck through it,

18:29.312 --> 18:33.212
'cause never that great with the double
clutch, but a truck driver could just...

18:37.012 --> 18:39.162
- Care to share?
- Well, it's obvious.

18:39.197 --> 18:41.312
I mean, you think there's a murder here,

18:41.412 --> 18:43.012
like, right underneath Gibbs' nose.

18:43.112 --> 18:45.512
That whatever took place, took
place without Gibbs knowing.

18:45.712 --> 18:47.312
And that could never happen?

18:48.812 --> 18:50.512
I'm going to share a secret with you.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.712
It's a theory I've been working on.

18:53.112 --> 18:54.112
Off the books.

19:00.912 --> 19:02.512
Okay... the man

19:03.512 --> 19:04.512
is magic.

19:04.612 --> 19:05.612
Like dark magic.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.512
He has eyes and ears everywhere.

19:09.112 --> 19:10.312
He appears like a

19:10.912 --> 19:11.677
mist.

19:11.712 --> 19:13.512
Whenever I get a clue, he just...

19:14.612 --> 19:15.812
materializes.

19:17.212 --> 19:18.712
Maybe he bugged your lab.

19:18.912 --> 19:19.912
No.

19:20.912 --> 19:22.012
I checked.

19:25.112 --> 19:27.012
What's that like? It sounds aggravating.

19:27.512 --> 19:28.512
No.

19:28.812 --> 19:30.012
Does he ever get angry?

19:31.912 --> 19:33.212
Snap... Snap.

19:33.412 --> 19:34.412
Never.

19:35.612 --> 19:38.212
He only uses his powers for good.

19:41.512 --> 19:42.512
Well,

19:43.212 --> 19:45.612
- sounds like you're a fan.
- No crime like this could

19:45.647 --> 19:47.912
ever take place under Gibbs' nose.

19:48.212 --> 19:49.312
He wouldn't allow it.

19:49.712 --> 19:51.562
I understand. If we could just get back.

19:51.597 --> 19:53.412
No, I don't think you
do understand. Okay,

19:53.612 --> 19:57.312
one night I was in my lab.
It was dark and stormy...

19:57.412 --> 19:58.412
Stop.

19:59.112 --> 20:01.212
Okay, go a smidge to your left.

20:01.812 --> 20:04.112
Right, a smidge to your
right. Back to your right.

20:05.312 --> 20:06.912
There it is, there it is. Stop.

20:07.812 --> 20:09.212
Are you serious, McGee?

20:09.312 --> 20:11.812
Hold that position. I've
just barely got a signal here.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.312
This going to work?

20:13.812 --> 20:16.512
This thing's so ancient, it doesn't
even have the protocols modern

20:16.547 --> 20:18.612
day security systems defend against.

20:19.412 --> 20:21.777
It's bringing back
memories of playing Zork.

20:21.812 --> 20:24.612
I'm tempted to tell it to
go throw the crystal orb.

20:25.412 --> 20:26.612
Here we go.

20:29.212 --> 20:30.412
Whoa, what's that?

20:30.712 --> 20:32.212
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

20:34.212 --> 20:36.712
It's a link. Indicates
an eyewitness statement.

20:36.812 --> 20:39.412
Hasn't been digitized. Doubt we
could play it even if it had been.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.612
Witness' name?

20:40.812 --> 20:41.912
Just an address.

20:42.112 --> 20:44.412
We need to know what this witness knows.

20:44.712 --> 20:46.312
My arms are killing me.

20:53.412 --> 20:55.012
The FBI car out front.

20:56.212 --> 20:57.312
Got it.

21:00.212 --> 21:02.212
Their tires, not their throats.

21:05.712 --> 21:07.412
Hey, boss, if you've got a printer,

21:07.612 --> 21:11.012
I might be able to convert some of
these crime scene sketches to dot matrix.

21:27.812 --> 21:29.212
This is going nowhere.

21:29.412 --> 21:31.412
I've never been entirely
certain she's all there.

21:34.712 --> 21:36.312
Hey, I remembered something.

21:38.312 --> 21:40.212
Something relevant, Ms. Sciuto?

21:44.412 --> 21:45.912
Director Shepard,

21:46.012 --> 21:49.312
she asked me personally to
do some forensic work for her.

21:51.612 --> 21:53.812
I want to know whose
fingerprints are on these.

21:55.112 --> 21:56.612
Which is, strange.

21:57.312 --> 22:00.812
I determined that there was a dead
man's fingerprints on a liquor bottle

22:01.212 --> 22:02.612
that was left in her study.

22:06.512 --> 22:09.262
The Director's father supposedly
killed himself years ago,

22:09.297 --> 22:12.012
so I guess that doesn't
really help your case, but,

22:12.212 --> 22:16.012
they made it seem like somebody was
trying mess with her head, you know?

22:16.412 --> 22:19.712
Like the CIA maybe trying to frame her.

22:21.012 --> 22:23.612
She's a lot smarter than you give
her credit for, Agent Fornell.

22:23.912 --> 22:26.012
Guys? Hello?

22:50.112 --> 22:51.412
NCIS.

22:53.512 --> 22:56.412
Buy you a cup of coffee, Miss Benoit?

23:05.797 --> 23:07.797
I had hoped, Rene,

23:07.997 --> 23:10.497
that you and I would
meet again in person,

23:10.697 --> 23:14.197
enjoy a glass of
"L'Esprit de Courvoisier"

23:14.297 --> 23:16.397
which you so generously gave me.

23:16.597 --> 23:18.297
This is the best I can do.

23:18.697 --> 23:22.297
A confession: I am
actually a medical examiner.

23:22.397 --> 23:24.297
And your untimely death

23:24.797 --> 23:27.197
left questions which
only you can answer.

23:27.397 --> 23:28.497
To wit:

23:28.997 --> 23:30.697
Stippling patterns,

23:31.297 --> 23:33.297
powder burns on your forehead,

23:33.397 --> 23:36.597
which, though diminished
by immersion in saltwater,

23:36.897 --> 23:40.197
indicate a contact wound at close range.

23:40.997 --> 23:41.997
No...

23:42.397 --> 23:45.097
defensive wounds, so

23:45.497 --> 23:48.197
for some reason, a
cautious man like yourself

23:48.397 --> 23:51.997
allowed an armed assailant to
get extraordinarily close...

23:53.197 --> 23:56.697
or else the gunshot
wound was self-inflicted.

23:56.997 --> 23:58.197
My colleague

23:58.797 --> 24:00.697
came to the same conclusion.

24:00.797 --> 24:04.297
The bullet entered the frontal
bone just above the left orbit,

24:04.497 --> 24:06.397
traveled in an upward trajectory

24:06.497 --> 24:09.297
consistent with a left-handed suicide.

24:09.897 --> 24:10.897
Ducky?

24:11.297 --> 24:12.597
Did you say something to me?

24:12.997 --> 24:14.062
No, I didn't.

24:14.097 --> 24:17.397
Well, I could have sworn I
heard you talking down here.

24:18.397 --> 24:20.197
I'm gonna come back when you're done.

24:22.397 --> 24:25.297
The FBI's convinced you were murdered,

24:25.497 --> 24:27.197
but you didn't tell them that, did you?

24:27.697 --> 24:31.097
Well, you were never an easy
man to understand in life.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.297
Why should your death be any different?

24:35.597 --> 24:39.097
I do wish you'd shed some
light on this mystery.

24:39.597 --> 24:41.597
Because the prime suspect

24:42.097 --> 24:44.497
is a mutual acquaintance of ours.

24:53.897 --> 24:55.497
That's a start.

24:57.097 --> 24:59.597
They're expecting me at
your office, Agent Gibbs.

25:00.597 --> 25:02.397
Well, their questions aren't mine.

25:02.597 --> 25:03.897
Questions about Tony?

25:04.797 --> 25:07.297
No, questions about your father.

25:10.897 --> 25:13.797
Well, we've been here
before, haven't we, Toby.

25:13.997 --> 25:16.597
You were saying some pretty
bad stuff about me back then.

25:16.897 --> 25:20.197
I hope you've learned a few
things since then. I know I have.

25:20.997 --> 25:21.997
Yeah.

25:24.097 --> 25:25.597
You've done some growing, DiNozzo.

25:25.697 --> 25:28.797
The Director thought enough of
you to personally select you for

25:28.897 --> 25:30.697
an extended undercover assignment.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.697
Yep, she played matchmaker.

25:33.197 --> 25:35.397
How did you get so close
to La Grenouille's daughter?

25:38.297 --> 25:40.097
I see where you're going with this.

25:40.197 --> 25:42.497
You'd like to know
a few pick-up tricks?

25:43.297 --> 25:45.197
I wish I could tell you, but

25:46.397 --> 25:50.297
kind of a family secret and
I took an oath. Sorry. Chip?

25:50.997 --> 25:51.997
No.

25:53.697 --> 25:55.797
So you reported back to
the Director about the girl?

25:56.197 --> 25:59.097
Jeanne? Yes, well, her father
was an international arms dealer,

25:59.197 --> 26:02.297
a threat to the country,
the world, really.

26:02.497 --> 26:04.497
So, yeah, I did what I was told.

26:07.197 --> 26:09.297
The Director ordered
you to sleep with her?

26:10.497 --> 26:11.897
Are you attracted to her?

26:12.097 --> 26:14.197
- Yeah.
- So what's the problem?

26:17.197 --> 26:19.697
- I wouldn't call it an order.
- So you didn't have any problem

26:19.732 --> 26:21.797
developing that kind of
a relationship with her?

26:22.097 --> 26:24.797
- No, not at all.
- But you developed feelings for her.

26:24.832 --> 26:27.497
That wasn't very professional,
Tony. How'd that happen?

26:27.897 --> 26:28.897
Gradually.

26:36.397 --> 26:37.797
And then all of a sudden...

26:41.597 --> 26:43.697
The Director tell you to
break the girl's heart?

26:44.697 --> 26:46.097
What'd that feel like?

26:48.097 --> 26:51.197
This is more like a therapy
session than an interrogation.

26:52.497 --> 26:54.197
Why are you so
interested in my feelings?

26:54.297 --> 26:55.797
Because you had them.

27:00.597 --> 27:02.597
So strange being back in the city.

27:03.697 --> 27:05.997
I volunteered for a fellowship in Gabon.

27:06.397 --> 27:07.397
Africa?

27:08.697 --> 27:10.197
That's a big change of scenery.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.997
I rode a canoe to the
hospital every day.

27:13.897 --> 27:16.297
My commute consisted of avoiding hippos.

27:16.497 --> 27:17.497
Did it help?

27:17.897 --> 27:19.597
I like to think it helped some people.

27:21.097 --> 27:24.197
But no, I couldn't get what
happened out of my head.

27:24.597 --> 27:27.897
Whatever you told the FBI, they're
convinced your father was murdered.

27:29.297 --> 27:30.397
He was.

27:33.897 --> 27:35.497
How can you be so sure of that?

27:35.997 --> 27:37.097
I thought you knew...

27:38.697 --> 27:39.997
what I saw that night.

27:40.297 --> 27:41.597
What'd you see?

27:48.997 --> 27:50.097
Duck.

27:50.797 --> 27:53.497
I only let Jethro call me that, Ziva.

27:53.597 --> 27:55.797
I think she means "doc", Ducky.

27:58.297 --> 28:00.197
Okay, La Grenouille's yacht.

28:00.497 --> 28:03.497
Single shell casing was found
on the deck. No blood splatter.

28:03.597 --> 28:07.197
Le Grenouille must have
been standing by the railing.

28:07.997 --> 28:09.497
Okay, I'm La Grenouille.

28:10.897 --> 28:11.897
Bang.

28:12.397 --> 28:14.097
Overboard, gun goes with me.

28:14.297 --> 28:15.997
Nine-mil'shell casing lands there.

28:16.032 --> 28:17.032
Or...

28:19.097 --> 28:20.197
someone

28:21.497 --> 28:23.497
approaches you with the nine.

28:25.097 --> 28:26.297
Facing you.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.097
Someone you know.

28:31.597 --> 28:33.997
And I stand here and let
you shoot me in the head?

28:34.397 --> 28:36.897
I don't flinch, don't turn my head?

28:37.797 --> 28:39.297
The gun is concealed.

28:39.597 --> 28:40.797
Your guard is down.

28:42.997 --> 28:44.597
Still, when you bring the gun up.

28:44.697 --> 28:46.997
I'm on boat. Why don't
I just jump overboard?

28:49.197 --> 28:50.897
Why do I let you shoot me in the head?

28:55.097 --> 28:56.597
Jeanne must be going through hell.

28:56.997 --> 28:58.362
I didn't mean to hurt her.

28:58.397 --> 29:00.997
What other option was there? She
was in love with you too, right?

29:01.032 --> 29:02.497
I don't know.

29:02.597 --> 29:03.997
Come on, Tony.

29:04.297 --> 29:06.097
You're a better liar than that.

29:07.797 --> 29:08.897
I love you, Jeanne.

29:14.197 --> 29:16.897
Well, you're right,
Agent Fornell, I'm lying.

29:18.097 --> 29:20.997
Everything I did with her was a
lie. Just recalling those lies,

29:21.032 --> 29:22.997
I believe that I'm lying now.

29:23.197 --> 29:24.297
It's a,

29:24.797 --> 29:27.697
it's a cacophony of lies,
really. Are you getting all this?!

29:29.297 --> 29:30.597
'Cause it's good stuff!

29:35.697 --> 29:38.297
Yeah, she was in love with me.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.397
We were in love.

29:43.897 --> 29:45.497
What else do you want to know?

29:45.797 --> 29:47.397
How is it supposed to end, Tony?

29:49.497 --> 29:51.897
I mean, there was never
gonna be a happily ever after.

29:54.097 --> 29:55.397
Earlier that morning,

29:55.897 --> 29:57.097
the day her father died,

29:57.397 --> 29:58.997
Jeanne was almost killed twice.

30:03.897 --> 30:05.897
You barely managed to
save her from a drug dealer

30:05.997 --> 30:07.597
when somebody tried to blow her up.

30:08.997 --> 30:10.797
Yeah, I know. Someone
should figure that out.

30:10.832 --> 30:12.062
Likely one of his enemies.

30:12.097 --> 30:13.662
Likely. He had a lot of enemies.

30:13.697 --> 30:15.908
Any one of them could have
caught up with him on that yacht.

30:15.932 --> 30:17.097
Through the girl?

30:17.597 --> 30:19.297
Jeanne was a key to her father.

30:19.497 --> 30:21.497
No one knew that better than you.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.397
So let's talk about that night.

30:25.997 --> 30:27.062
I have to go.

30:27.097 --> 30:28.297
What'd you tell Fornell?

30:28.897 --> 30:30.397
I told him what happened.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.497
- When?
- The night he was killed.

30:33.997 --> 30:35.497
How do you know what happened?

30:35.697 --> 30:36.797
Ziva,

30:37.797 --> 30:38.997
this mark,

30:39.497 --> 30:40.897
what does it mean to you?

30:43.197 --> 30:44.597
Give me your hand.

30:48.797 --> 30:50.597
It's a pressure point.

30:54.997 --> 30:56.097
In Mossad,

30:56.597 --> 30:57.997
we call it a "thumb tap".

30:58.197 --> 31:00.397
David says she left you
alone in Jeanne's apartment.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.908
She tried to call you on the phone
the next morning, nobody answered.

31:02.932 --> 31:05.097
Your partner did not
know where you were.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.697
- I went for a drive.
- Your car was blown up that morning.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.297
- Company car.
- Where?

31:11.297 --> 31:12.797
I need to clear my head.

31:12.997 --> 31:15.197
I wasn't plotting a course. I was upset.

31:15.297 --> 31:17.797
Of course you were. The
woman you love is in danger.

31:17.897 --> 31:20.097
She's running for her life
and you can't protect her.

31:20.197 --> 31:21.997
- You telling me you saw who did it?
- Yes.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.097
Who?!

31:24.697 --> 31:27.497
She'd never be safe, not
with her father around.

31:27.532 --> 31:28.897
She knew it, you knew it.

31:28.997 --> 31:31.697
- There was only one way to save her!
- Who pulled the trigger?

31:33.697 --> 31:34.497
Tony.

31:34.597 --> 31:37.197
- Bang.
- You killed La Grenouille!

31:38.897 --> 31:39.897
I did what?

31:48.173 --> 31:51.173
Jeanne Benoit saw Tony shoot her father?

31:52.173 --> 31:54.173
- He had motive.
- And means.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.873
And no alibi.

31:57.673 --> 31:59.673
He was supposed to meet
us at the bar last night.

31:59.773 --> 32:01.973
He did not arrive, did not call.

32:02.473 --> 32:06.238
Jethro, no two suicides are identical,

32:06.273 --> 32:09.573
but the similarities here
are more than coincidental.

32:10.273 --> 32:12.573
Right down to the mark on the hand.

32:13.073 --> 32:14.373
I've seen that before.

32:14.473 --> 32:16.873
Yeah, so have I. Jasper
Shephard's suicide.

32:16.908 --> 32:18.173
Supposed suicide.

32:20.573 --> 32:22.573
Somebody is missing from this party.

32:27.973 --> 32:31.373
Don't get too comfortable. You
already scratched my settee.

32:32.673 --> 32:35.573
Your agents have been tearing
apart my house all afternoon,

32:35.673 --> 32:37.873
and they wouldn't even tell
me what they're looking for.

32:37.973 --> 32:40.273
La Grenouille was killed
with a nine-millimeter Glock.

32:40.473 --> 32:41.873
You have a second weapon.

32:41.973 --> 32:43.373
A nine-millimeter Glock.

32:43.973 --> 32:46.973
Registered for personal
use. Yet we can't find it.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.473
You could have asked me.

32:48.773 --> 32:50.973
- Where's your gun?
- I gave it to La Grenouille.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.473
You have the bullets. Take the damn gun!

32:53.773 --> 32:55.273
Anybody witness that?

32:55.473 --> 32:56.473
Gibbs.

32:57.173 --> 32:58.173
Works for me.

32:58.473 --> 33:00.873
Grenouille took the gun,
DiNozzo took it from him.

33:01.873 --> 33:03.673
- DiNozzo?
- He's in custody.

33:03.973 --> 33:06.673
An eyewitness at the marina saw
Agent DiNozzo commit the murder.

33:06.873 --> 33:08.973
You have a positive I.D.

33:09.173 --> 33:12.173
at night, in the dark, from a distance?

33:12.373 --> 33:14.273
I think she'd recognize her boyfriend.

33:14.473 --> 33:16.573
Jeanne Benoit is your witness?

33:17.373 --> 33:21.273
You turned my entire department
upside down based on her testimony?

33:21.373 --> 33:22.538
I want to talk to her.

33:22.573 --> 33:24.773
- Absolutely not.
- Okay.

33:26.573 --> 33:27.573
Okay.

33:44.973 --> 33:46.473
My name is Jenny Shepard.

33:46.673 --> 33:48.573
I'm the Director of NCIS.

33:49.773 --> 33:51.273
Give her a little rope.

33:51.373 --> 33:52.673
I'm the one responsible

33:52.708 --> 33:53.773
for your pain.

33:54.073 --> 33:57.073
I ordered Tony to
involve you romantically.

33:57.273 --> 33:59.773
Involved you in something
you had nothing to do with.

34:00.173 --> 34:02.473
I'm sorry. I crossed a line.

34:04.773 --> 34:07.473
He felt horrible for
what he put you through.

34:07.973 --> 34:09.373
When he told you the truth...

34:09.473 --> 34:12.072
My name isn't Tony DiNardo,
it's Anthony DiNozzo.

34:12.108 --> 34:13.973
This has all been a lie. Why?

34:14.572 --> 34:15.973
You should ask him.

34:18.373 --> 34:21.373
I think it's the first sign
you're doing something wrong...

34:22.672 --> 34:25.373
if you feel bad about telling the truth.

34:26.072 --> 34:28.172
You think Tony's a bad person?

34:29.172 --> 34:30.773
He killed my father.

34:32.373 --> 34:34.873
That must have been the
worst day of your life.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.572
Of anybody's life.

34:37.273 --> 34:39.373
And now you can't stop reliving it.

34:40.172 --> 34:41.773
The way you were feeling.

34:42.572 --> 34:45.172
You probably just wanted
to run away from it all.

34:45.672 --> 34:46.873
Bought a plane ticket,

34:47.873 --> 34:49.373
packed a bag.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.172
Maybe you were tempted to leave a note.

34:53.373 --> 34:54.973
Some last words.

34:55.172 --> 34:57.773
Before I knew what Tony was capable of.

34:58.673 --> 35:00.273
Next thing you know,

35:00.573 --> 35:02.473
you're in the car on
the way to the airport.

35:03.173 --> 35:06.073
Praying that any minute
you would wake up...

35:07.273 --> 35:09.573
and find out that none
of it ever happened.

35:09.873 --> 35:10.973
I trusted him.

35:11.273 --> 35:12.973
And he lied to me.

35:13.373 --> 35:15.373
Even after all the deception...

35:17.273 --> 35:18.873
do you just go?

35:20.773 --> 35:23.373
Or do you stop and
see him one last time?

35:23.573 --> 35:24.773
Which him?

35:24.973 --> 35:26.273
Tony or the dad?

35:26.673 --> 35:28.473
That's the moment, right?

35:29.573 --> 35:31.773
You've been taking body blows all day,

35:31.808 --> 35:34.473
and finally that's the moment

35:35.073 --> 35:38.273
you actually have to make a choice.

35:39.273 --> 35:40.773
Forget the airport.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.273
Go to the marina.

35:43.873 --> 35:45.573
- Pull the car over.
- Yes.

35:45.973 --> 35:48.073
- That's where I saw him.
- Your dad?

35:48.173 --> 35:48.938
Yes.

35:48.973 --> 35:51.473
- One last time before he's gone?
- Yes.

35:52.073 --> 35:53.073
No.

35:55.273 --> 35:56.673
The stars aligned

35:56.873 --> 36:00.273
so that you arrived at the marina
when Tony pulled the trigger?

36:05.973 --> 36:07.073
You're lying.

36:09.673 --> 36:11.673
What really happened, Jeanne?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.773
It's my fault.

36:19.773 --> 36:20.973
I did it.

36:24.373 --> 36:25.773
I killed him.

36:26.373 --> 36:28.273
It feels that way, doesn't it?

36:30.073 --> 36:31.573
But it's not true.

36:34.173 --> 36:35.573
Believe me, I know.

36:37.073 --> 36:38.673
You blamed Tony.

36:39.373 --> 36:40.973
Now you're blaming yourself.

36:42.673 --> 36:44.373
What really happened that night?

36:46.273 --> 36:48.373
I made the wrong choice.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.573
I wanted to see him.

36:51.073 --> 36:53.173
He was waiting for me at the yacht.

36:55.073 --> 36:56.373
But I just couldn't.

36:57.773 --> 36:59.173
I kept driving.

36:59.473 --> 37:01.173
You never went to the marina.

37:01.373 --> 37:03.073
I figured he'd come and find me.

37:03.973 --> 37:06.873
No matter what, Dad always found me.

37:07.973 --> 37:09.173
And then he didn't.

37:11.273 --> 37:12.573
I just knew.

37:13.473 --> 37:14.873
You must be angry.

37:15.473 --> 37:19.073
That you can't have that one
moment to live over again.

37:19.873 --> 37:22.173
I don't know if you
could have changed it.

37:23.273 --> 37:25.173
I don't know if you
could have saved him.

37:25.973 --> 37:26.973
He loved you.

37:28.773 --> 37:29.973
Of that...

37:31.373 --> 37:32.773
I am sure.

37:47.973 --> 37:49.573
Who do you want to talk to now?

37:51.273 --> 37:52.338
How's the case?

37:52.373 --> 37:55.073
Falling apart. Better not be here.
It'll just create more problems.

37:55.108 --> 37:56.673
No, I'm here to solve them.

37:59.173 --> 38:00.473
Well, well, well,

38:01.173 --> 38:02.173
Mr. Kort

38:02.373 --> 38:03.473
from the CIA.

38:04.173 --> 38:06.138
Your boss killed my informant.

38:06.173 --> 38:08.873
I need your help to take
La Grenouille down for it.

38:08.908 --> 38:11.473
This is not going to end well for you.

38:12.873 --> 38:14.773
Your investigation ends now.

38:15.273 --> 38:17.273
This is La Grenouille's handler.

38:17.573 --> 38:19.773
I think the CIA would want
to know who killed him.

38:20.073 --> 38:22.673
La Grenouille was killed by
an associate who has since

38:22.773 --> 38:25.373
assumed control of his organization.

38:25.573 --> 38:26.673
Let me guess...

38:26.873 --> 38:29.173
you stepped up to run the whole show.

38:29.873 --> 38:32.073
Did number two here
just confess to murder?

38:32.773 --> 38:35.273
The CIA does not assassinate people.

38:35.373 --> 38:36.673
Not on American soil.

38:36.873 --> 38:38.873
Let's see your
get-out-of-jail-free card.

38:42.073 --> 38:43.073
Eyes only.

38:50.473 --> 38:51.773
It was sanctioned.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.373
La Grenouille wanted to retire.

38:55.673 --> 38:56.873
He's retired.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.473
It's that simple?

38:58.508 --> 38:59.873
CIA wants it simple.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.273
Well, I guess we're
done asking questions.

39:03.373 --> 39:04.673
That's not for you...

39:06.073 --> 39:07.573
Just between us...

39:07.873 --> 39:09.473
Who killed Jasper Shepard?

39:12.273 --> 39:13.773
Jasper Shepard.

39:22.073 --> 39:25.273
Anything that guy wouldn't do
to keep a long-term op intact?

39:25.573 --> 39:26.573
Nope.

39:27.173 --> 39:28.773
Anything he wouldn't say

39:29.073 --> 39:31.573
to shut this down
before it got too loud?

39:32.573 --> 39:33.773
That night...

39:34.673 --> 39:37.473
at her house, Jenny
gave her gun to the Frog.

39:38.573 --> 39:39.873
You have the bullets.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.273
Take the damn gun!

39:41.673 --> 39:43.173
Protect yourself.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.138
She did.

39:45.173 --> 39:47.073
And that would explain
how it got to the yacht.

39:47.108 --> 39:48.173
It would.

39:48.273 --> 39:49.873
And Kort used that gun...

39:51.073 --> 39:52.373
to kill him.

39:56.873 --> 39:57.973
You're right.

39:59.073 --> 40:00.173
She's cleared.

40:03.873 --> 40:04.973
The file?

40:05.673 --> 40:06.773
Maybe.

40:18.073 --> 40:19.373
Hey, Trent.

40:21.873 --> 40:23.473
He wasn't just an operative.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.273
He was somebody's father.

40:41.473 --> 40:44.373
- Be a man, Tony.
- She accused me of murder.

40:44.473 --> 40:46.973
Who is the bad guy? Be a man.

40:47.973 --> 40:49.973
Go tell her what she needs to hear.

41:03.873 --> 41:06.373
Hey, can you give us a
second, please? Thank you.

41:06.473 --> 41:07.473
No problem.

41:08.073 --> 41:09.073
Hey.

41:11.173 --> 41:13.273
I'm sorry you got caught
in the middle of all this.

41:13.308 --> 41:14.673
Was any of it real...

41:16.273 --> 41:17.273
Tony?

41:24.273 --> 41:25.273
No.

41:36.873 --> 41:38.473
I wish I'd never met you.

41:54.773 --> 41:57.273
I hope you're not
rushing out on my account.

41:58.173 --> 41:59.138
Apparently not.

41:59.173 --> 42:02.573
Secnav tells me you're going to be
taking a couple weeks of personal time.

42:03.673 --> 42:07.273
It was never my intention to
burden you with this responsibility.

42:07.773 --> 42:08.773
I don't mind.

42:08.973 --> 42:11.273
My wife however, is not so forgiving.

42:14.173 --> 42:15.373
Is this yours, Leon?

42:16.873 --> 42:17.873
Keep it.

42:25.673 --> 42:28.173
You owe the Bureau for two
sets of all-weather radials.

42:28.973 --> 42:29.973
Yeah.

42:31.073 --> 42:32.073
Bill me.

42:39.073 --> 42:40.273
Fairy tale ending?

42:40.573 --> 42:44.473
The Frog is dead, and the jesters
have been kicked out of the kingdom.

42:44.873 --> 42:46.573
The queen is back on her throne.

42:46.973 --> 42:48.873
If you're expecting
some sort of knighthood,

42:48.973 --> 42:51.373
I'm sorry to say I've
misplaced my sword.

42:51.773 --> 42:53.173
Maybe it's with your gun.

42:54.173 --> 42:55.173
Maybe.

42:55.973 --> 42:57.773
Funny quirk about the Frog,

42:57.873 --> 42:59.073
arms dealer...

43:00.473 --> 43:01.773
never carried a gun.

43:01.873 --> 43:02.973
Except that night.

43:03.873 --> 43:04.973
Take the damn gun!

43:05.273 --> 43:06.573
Protect yourself.

43:06.973 --> 43:08.673
You're signing my death warrant.

43:09.973 --> 43:12.573
- That what happened?
- That's how I remember it.

43:13.373 --> 43:15.073
You remember it differently?

43:17.073 --> 43:18.173
Take the damn gun!

43:18.373 --> 43:19.673
Protect yourself.

43:20.673 --> 43:22.773
You're signing my death warrant.

43:28.873 --> 43:30.373
Long live the queen.
