<i>To facilitate the broadcast media,
we will precede each announcement</i>

01:34.921 --> 01:38.338
<i>with a 5 secs. tone, followed
by a 1 sec. pause.</i>

01:38.338 --> 01:42.755
<i>Anyone who hasn't got a press kit

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Peter Willis

<i>were awakened by Dr. Roger
Burroughs, the flight surgeon.</i>

02:07.298 --> 02:11.340
<i>They were given a final physical
examination and pronounced all fit.</i>

02:11.548 --> 02:14.840
<i>The crew then had a breakfast
consisting of half a grapefruit,</i>

02:14.840 --> 02:16.507

- Good morning, Horace.

02:31.674 --> 02:32.925
Are we late?

02:32.925 --> 02:34.550
Traffic was terrible.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.509
Well, I see you're all in good spirits.

02:36.509 --> 02:39.509
- Have you done the EDS test yet?
- They're almost completed.

02:44.759 --> 02:46.801
- Do you want us to enter?
- In a moment.

02:47.093 --> 02:48.135
What's up?

02:48.135 --> 02:50.426
I'm not very good at things like this.

02:50.426 --> 02:53.218
I've known you, especially
Colonel Brubaker,

02:54.135 --> 02:55.176
for some time.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.843
What you're about to do today,
I've spent my life.

03:01.469 --> 03:05.511
I'd just like yuh to know that I feel
that all I've ever worked for,

03:06.219 --> 03:08.427
it has meaning today,
and I'm very proud.

03:08.886 --> 03:10.261
Proud of the program

03:10.886 --> 03:13.886
and proud of what I've been able to
contribute in some small way, and

03:15.012 --> 03:16.262
proud of you.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.012
I'd like for you to take
this Bible with you,

03:20.012 --> 03:22.012
from me, from all of us.

03:22.012 --> 03:24.303
Why, Horace, I don't know
what to say.

03:24.887 --> 03:27.470
- Well, try saying nothing for a change.
- Horace...

03:28.845 --> 03:29.763
thank you.

03:30.929 --> 03:32.554
We'd be honored to take this with us.

03:34.221 --> 03:36.054
Well, gentlemen, let's go to Mars.

03:37.138 --> 03:39.596

<i>- following launch.
- Good morning, Congressman Peaker.</i>

03:47.514 --> 03:50.680
We've reserved three of the best seats
for you and for General Enders,

03:50.680 --> 03:51.930
right next to Vice President.

03:52.222 --> 03:53.180
Is he here yet?

03:53.180 --> 03:54.930
No, sir, he's due any moment.

03:56.764 --> 03:59.723
Asshole probably thinks they'll delay
the launch for him.

04:00.181 --> 04:02.806
Someone should tell him this is not
a bridge opening.

04:02.806 --> 04:05.223
I hope you and Mrs. Peaker will be
very comfortable.

04:05.223 --> 04:08.223
The Agency would like you to have
these commemorative binoculars

04:08.223 --> 04:10.681
to help you watch the launch
and to remember this day.

04:11.723 --> 04:13.516
That's very nice. Look, Emily.

04:14.057 --> 04:16.641
They have the date,
Capricorn One emblem in gold.

04:16.641 --> 04:19.141
- Very nice, Hollis.
- I'm glad you like them.

04:19.141 --> 04:21.141
Well, we'll need another pair
for my wife.

04:21.141 --> 04:22.349
I, I beg your pardon, sir?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.391
Oh, don't make a fuss, Hollis,
it's all right.

04:24.391 --> 04:26.432
I said, 'we'll need another pair
for my wife.'

04:26.975 --> 04:29.433
- It's really not necessary.
- Here, Emily, take mine.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.142
- I really won't need them.
- No, I don't...

04:31.142 --> 04:33.100
Congressman Peaker,
there's only a limited...

04:33.100 --> 04:36.475
I didn't quite hear what you said.
Would you mind repeating it, please?

04:37.183 --> 04:40.225
Oh, there's no problem.
I'll get another pair right away.

04:40.725 --> 04:42.143
Very thoughtful of you.

04:43.726 --> 04:47.434

Very well, Mr. Vice President.

05:30.771 --> 05:34.479
- How is the President today?
- Oh, just fine, thank you, Hollis.

05:34.479 --> 05:38.480
He asked me to personally express
his regrets at being unable to be here.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.022
There were some pressing matters

05:41.022 --> 05:43.022
that needed his attention
in Washington.

05:43.022 --> 05:44.397
Like getting re-elected?

05:44.730 --> 05:48.480
Mr. Vice President? I hope you and
Mrs. Price will be very comfortable.

I am most interested in a lot of things,

11:51.505 --> 11:53.381
including my wife's bridge game.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.839
That is not the same as
supporting something.

11:56.714 --> 12:01.881
Hollis, there are many people who feel
that we have problems here, on Earth

12:01.881 --> 12:03.173
that merit our attention

12:03.173 --> 12:06.507
before we spent billions of dollars
on outer space.

12:06.799 --> 12:10.132
There are a number of people who feel
there are no more pressing problems

12:10.132 --> 12:12.257
than our declining position
in world leadership.

12:12.882 --> 12:15.382
It was wonderful seeing you again,
Hollis.

12:15.715 --> 12:18.132
The pleasure was all mine,
Mr. Vice President.

12:18.924 --> 12:21.550
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.</i>

12:21.550 --> 12:24.716
<i>You're at Tplus 2 hrs. 16 mins.
into the flight.</i>

12:24.966 --> 12:27.383
<i>The spacecraft is now
in elliptical orbit</i>

12:27.383 --> 12:29.841
<i>with an apogee of
- 141 nautical miles</i>

12:29.841 --> 12:32.508
<i>and a perigee of 122 nautical miles.</i>

12:32.508 --> 12:35.884
<i>Mission Control reports full voice
contact with the flight crew.</i>

12:35.884 --> 12:37.634
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

12:38.426 --> 12:40.592
Welcome, Colonel.
Would you please come with us?

12:40.592 --> 12:43.759
I'm not going anywhere till somebody
tells us what the hell's going on.

12:43.759 --> 12:46.801
- Everything will be explained to you.
- Bullshit, I wanna know right now!

12:46.801 --> 12:50.593
Colonel, I know this sounds strange,
we are all working for the same thing.

12:50.593 --> 12:51.760
We are not your enemy.

13:16.761 --> 13:18.012
Please, wait here.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.887
I suppose you're wondering
why I called you up here.

13:46.514 --> 13:47.181
Good morning.

13:47.514 --> 13:49.472
Hi there, Dr. Kelloway,
nice to see you.

13:50.306 --> 13:52.222
A funny thing happened
on the way to Mars.

13:59.014 --> 14:00.681
Well, why don't you all sit down?

14:02.890 --> 14:03.807
Well.

14:10.765 --> 14:11.765
Okay,

14:12.765 --> 14:13.890
here it is.

14:15.558 --> 14:18.766
I have to start by saying that
if there was any other way,

14:20.058 --> 14:24.433
if there was even a slight chance
of another alternative,

14:25.141 --> 14:28.766
I would give anything not to be here
with you now, anything.

14:30.809 --> 14:32.642
Bru, how long have we known
each other?

14:35.100 --> 14:37.767
Sixteen years, that's how long,

14:38.600 --> 14:39.892
sixteen years.

14:41.892 --> 14:43.851
You should have seen yourself then.

14:43.851 --> 14:46.101
You seemed walked out
of a Wheaties box.

14:46.435 --> 14:49.851
And me, all sweaty palmed and
deadly serious.

14:50.893 --> 14:54.976
I told everybody about this dream I had
of conquering the New Frontier

14:54.976 --> 14:57.685
and they all looked at me
like I was nuts.

14:57.685 --> 14:59.352
You looked at me and said, "yes".

15:00.102 --> 15:02.436
I remember when you told me
Kay was pregnant.

15:02.436 --> 15:04.227
We even went out and got crocked.

15:04.811 --> 15:08.311
I remember when Charles was born.
We went out and got crocked again.

15:08.311 --> 15:11.436
The two of us, Captain Terrific
and the Mad Doctor

15:11.436 --> 15:13.395
talking about reaching the stars

15:13.395 --> 15:16.645
and the bartender telling us
maybe we'd had enough.

15:16.978 --> 15:18.228
Sixteen years.

15:19.478 --> 15:21.353
And then, Armstrong,

15:22.270 --> 15:26.103
stepped out on the Moon
and we cried. We were so proud.

15:28.104 --> 15:32.479
Willis, you and Walker, you came in
about then, both bright and talented.

15:32.479 --> 15:34.688
Looked at me in my
wash and wear shirt,

15:34.688 --> 15:37.646
carrying on this hot love affair
with my slide rule

15:37.979 --> 15:40.688
and even you were caught up
in what we'd done.

15:43.897 --> 15:47.480
I remember when Glenn made
his first orbit in Mercury.

15:48.189 --> 15:51.189
They put up television sets in
Grand Central Station,

15:51.730 --> 15:55.690
and tens of thousands of people
missed their trains to watch.

15:57.106 --> 15:59.981
You know, when Apollo Seventeen
landed on the Moon,

16:00.898 --> 16:03.523
people were callin' up the networks
and bitchin'

16:03.523 --> 16:06.398
because reruns of I Love Lucy
were cancelled.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.023
Reruns, for Chrissake!

16:08.023 --> 16:10.274
I can understand if it was
the new Lucy Show.

16:10.274 --> 16:12.482
I mean, what the hell is
a walk on the Moon?

16:12.482 --> 16:13.482
But reruns?

16:13.899 --> 16:14.941
Oh, Jesus!

16:16.024 --> 16:18.232
And then, suddenly,
everybody started talking

16:18.232 --> 16:20.107
about how much everything cost.

16:20.107 --> 16:22.982
Was it really worth twenty billion
to go to another planet?

16:23.274 --> 16:26.233
What about cancer? What about
the slums? How much does it cost?

16:26.233 --> 16:29.067
How much does any dream cost?
For Chrissake!

16:29.067 --> 16:31.442
Since when is there an accountant
for ideas?

16:33.900 --> 16:35.942
You know who was
at the launch today?

16:36.483 --> 16:37.775
Not the President,

16:38.317 --> 16:40.401
the Vice President, that's who.

16:41.818 --> 16:44.193
The Vice President
and his plump wife.

16:46.526 --> 16:48.109
The President was busy.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.193
He's not busy.

16:51.901 --> 16:53.610
He's just a little bit scared.

16:55.735 --> 16:57.152
He sat there two months ago

16:57.152 --> 17:00.110
and put his feet up on Woodrow
Wilson desk.

17:00.569 --> 17:02.194
And he said, "Jim...

17:03.235 --> 17:04.484
make it good.

17:05.652 --> 17:07.694
Congress is on my back.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.569
They're looking for a reason
to cancel the program.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.819
We can't afford another screw-up!

17:15.028 --> 17:17.944
Make it good!
You have my every good wish."

17:18.694 --> 17:22.779
His every good wish. I got his
sanctimonious Vice President,

17:22.779 --> 17:24.070
that's what I got!

17:25.279 --> 17:28.862
And so there we are,
after all those hopes

17:29.029 --> 17:30.862
and all that dreaming.

17:30.862 --> 17:35.071
He sits there with those flags
behind his chair

17:35.071 --> 17:37.697
and tells we can't afford
a screw-up.

17:37.697 --> 17:40.030
And guess what?
We had a screw-up.

17:40.030 --> 17:43.863
A first-class, bonafide,
made-in-America screw-up!

17:44.697 --> 17:48.363
The nice people from Con-Amalgamate
delivered a life-support system

17:48.363 --> 17:51.198
cheap enough so they could make
a profit on the deal.

17:51.198 --> 17:54.698
Works out fine for everybody.
Con-Amalgamate makes money,

17:54.698 --> 17:56.906
we have our life-support system,

17:56.906 --> 17:58.156
everything is peachy!

17:58.448 --> 18:02.073
Except they made a little bit
too much profit.

18:02.073 --> 18:05.157
We found out two months ago,
it won't work.

18:05.865 --> 18:10.032
You guys would all be dead in three
weeks. It's as simple as that.

18:11.032 --> 18:13.907
So all I have to do is report that
and scrub the mission.

18:13.907 --> 18:15.615
Congress has its excuse,

18:15.824 --> 18:19.241
the President still has his desk
and we have no more program.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.158
What's sixteen years?
An actual drop in the bucket!

18:24.950 --> 18:27.700
All right, that's the end of the speech.
Now, we're getting

18:27.700 --> 18:29.866
to what they call
the moment of the truth.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.616
Come with me,

18:32.741 --> 18:34.159
I wanna show you something.

18:40.534 --> 18:45.242
<i>Roger, Houston. TMI burn time
will be 5 mins. 45 secs.</i>

18:45.534 --> 18:46.951
<i>Roger, Capricorn.</i>

18:49.035 --> 18:51.660
Delta vapor burn time 3.3 secs.

18:53.993 --> 18:57.202
There's a door here. I'm gonna open it
and walk into another area.

18:57.452 --> 19:01.410
If you follow me, you'll see a bit more.
I'll answer some questions and...

19:02.286 --> 19:03.578
and we're going to...

19:04.828 --> 19:06.328
Why don't you just follow me?

19:28.870 --> 19:31.621
You don't really think you're gonna
get away with this?

19:32.205 --> 19:33.955
Well, I don't know, it's a chance.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.580
Maybe it's not a very good one,
but it's a chance.

19:37.746 --> 19:40.830
- Who knows about this?
- Almost nobody.

19:41.455 --> 19:44.080
Houston is monitoring the actual flight.

19:44.413 --> 19:47.581
All the telemetry is coming from
the Command Module,

19:47.581 --> 19:49.497
so are your voices and medical data.

19:49.497 --> 19:52.456
We recorded everything from
the practice simulations.

19:53.331 --> 19:54.456
They don't know.

19:55.247 --> 19:58.872
All we need from you is the actual
television transmissions

19:58.872 --> 20:01.748
durnig the flight and the Mars landing,
that's all.

20:02.165 --> 20:04.165
Just the television transmissions.

20:04.540 --> 20:05.665
That's all?

20:06.082 --> 20:08.123
Just the television transmissions.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.873
We inserted a change in
the onboard computer,

20:12.873 --> 20:15.999
so the spacecraft will land
two hundred miles off target

20:15.999 --> 20:17.541
when it returns to Earth.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.166
You'll be flown to an island
near that point.

20:20.541 --> 20:22.749
From there you'll be transferred
to a helicopter.

20:22.749 --> 20:26.999
The helicopter will fly you to the space
capsule and you'll be put inside.

20:27.958 --> 20:31.792
It'll take the Recovery Forces
a minimum of an hour and a half

20:31.792 --> 20:33.834
to reach the splashdown site.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.042
By then, you'll be inside the capsule.

20:36.792 --> 20:39.084
When the prime recovery carrier
arrives,

20:39.084 --> 20:43.001
they'll find you inside the capsule
and take you out of the spacecraft.

20:44.418 --> 20:45.918
You've thought of everything.

20:46.585 --> 20:48.126
I don't know. I hope so.

20:50.001 --> 20:52.710
Of course, you're sure we'll go along,
right?

20:53.876 --> 20:55.168
No, I'm not.

20:55.918 --> 20:57.502
What if we say no?

20:58.502 --> 20:59.502
I don't know.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.711
Don't say no.

21:01.877 --> 21:05.086
When does Allen Funt come running in
and tell us we're on Candid Camera?

21:05.086 --> 21:07.544
Jesus! You think I like this?

21:07.544 --> 21:10.377
You think I really believe I'm standing
here in this craziness

21:10.377 --> 21:12.837
telling you about patching
and tape recordings

21:12.837 --> 21:16.503
and telemetry and an island two
hundred miles from the target zone?

21:16.712 --> 21:19.253
I don't, I don't know what the hell
I'm doing, either!

21:19.628 --> 21:23.420
I just case so Goddamn much,
I think it's worth it.

21:23.670 --> 21:26.629
I'm not even sure of that.
I just think it.

21:27.088 --> 21:28.629
I think I'm gonna throw up.

21:29.504 --> 21:30.921
Well, that'll solve everything.

21:30.921 --> 21:32.629
Well, what's this all gonna solve?

21:32.629 --> 21:34.963
It'll keep something alive
that shouldn't die!

21:35.171 --> 21:39.046
Before you all begin to moralize,
you take a look around.

21:39.671 --> 21:43.130
You look at what we've done and
how much more we can do.

21:44.047 --> 21:46.547
You look at what we've meant
to this country.

21:46.547 --> 21:49.089
Nobody gives a crap about anything
any more.

21:50.339 --> 21:52.964
People close their garages,
and triple lock their doors,

21:52.964 --> 21:55.423
they hide under the beds,
they even, they're even afraid

21:55.423 --> 21:58.548
to turn on their television sets
for fear of what they might find out

21:58.548 --> 21:59.715
in the evening news.

22:00.256 --> 22:02.173
There's nothing more to believe in.

22:02.423 --> 22:05.006
Now, you wanna blow this whole thing
wide open?

22:05.006 --> 22:07.048
God knows what it might do
to everybody.

22:07.381 --> 22:10.966
I'm sorry. I'm so Goddamn sorry.
I just don't know what else to do.

22:10.966 --> 22:14.382
I'm hanging on by my fingernails,
just like everybody else.

22:14.841 --> 22:17.007
Go on, you, you wanna be the ones

22:17.549 --> 22:20.549
who give everyone another reason
to give up?

22:20.757 --> 22:21.757
Go on!

22:24.258 --> 22:25.967
This is really wonderful.

22:26.758 --> 22:28.550
We go along with you

22:28.550 --> 22:32.050
and lie our asses off,
and the world of truth and ideals is...

22:32.342 --> 22:33.383
protected.

22:34.008 --> 22:36.717
But we don't wanna take part in
some giant ripe-off of yours

22:36.717 --> 22:39.259
and some how or other
we're managing to ruin the country.

22:39.259 --> 22:41.176
You're pretty good, Jim.
I'll give you that.

22:41.176 --> 22:43.676
Now, now, now, you're twisting
my words.

22:43.676 --> 22:46.426
- Don't sell yourself short!
- Don't sell the program short!

22:46.676 --> 22:49.468
Don't oversell it. I'm not so sure
that cancelling a flight

22:49.926 --> 22:53.427
or cutting off appropriations
means America folds up.

22:53.677 --> 22:55.677
It's not as simple as that
and you know it!

22:55.677 --> 22:56.760
I don't know it.

22:57.552 --> 23:00.135
If the only way to keep
something alive

23:01.135 --> 23:02.927
is to become everything I hate,

23:03.677 --> 23:05.885
I don't know if it's worth
keeping it alive.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.428
Please, Bru, don't talk like that.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.761
What the hell's the matter with you,
'Please, Bru, don't talk like that? '

23:11.761 --> 23:14.595
I don't think this is right!
All the rest is bullshit!

23:15.470 --> 23:16.553
You have to help!

23:16.803 --> 23:19.470
- What do you mean I have to?
- You have to help!

23:19.720 --> 23:21.179
And what if I don't?

23:21.179 --> 23:24.012
Please, don't put me in a corner.

23:24.887 --> 23:26.179
You're crazy.

23:26.762 --> 23:30.679
You know that? You are crazy! You've
got us in the middle of this nuthouse!

23:30.679 --> 23:32.471
And you don't wanna be put
in a corner?

23:34.096 --> 23:35.138
Your families!

23:37.513 --> 23:40.347
- What about our families?
- Please, you have to help!

23:40.347 --> 23:42.722
- What about our families?
- You have to help!

23:42.722 --> 23:44.722
Shit, this thing is outta my hands!

23:44.722 --> 23:46.972
You think it's all a couple
of looney scientists?

23:46.972 --> 23:48.305
It's not! It's bigger!

23:49.181 --> 23:51.973
There are people out there,
forces out there,

23:51.973 --> 23:55.389
who have a lot to lose!
They are grown-ups!

23:55.764 --> 23:58.098
It's gotten too big!
It's in the hands of grown-ups!

23:58.098 --> 23:59.306
What about our families?

23:59.306 --> 24:03.139
They are flying back from the Cape to
Houston! They are all on the plane!

24:04.015 --> 24:05.474
Naw, you're not serious.

24:06.057 --> 24:10.057
- Please, Bru, don't make me!
- You son-of-a-bitch, tell me!

24:10.057 --> 24:13.265
They're on the plane together!
You want it in writing?

24:14.432 --> 24:16.682
There's a device! It's on the plane!

24:17.515 --> 24:21.183
There's some people...! If I don't give
the 'all clear' signal they'll explode it!

24:21.183 --> 24:25.183
Don't you understand?
It doesn't have to be like this!

24:25.183 --> 24:26.600
You have to help!

24:26.808 --> 24:29.266
It's gotten outta control! It's too big!

24:31.808 --> 24:33.059
You wouldn't.

24:34.851 --> 24:36.226
Tell me you wouldn't.

24:40.642 --> 24:42.559
I, I can't tell you that, Bru.

24:51.018 --> 24:52.602
This coffee is horrible.

24:53.477 --> 24:56.143
- It's not that bad.
- It is. It's that bad.

24:56.477 --> 24:57.643
Don't drink it.

24:57.727 --> 25:00.227
I'm always unwrapping things.

25:00.643 --> 25:03.561
I wake up and take the cellophane
off the drink glass.

25:03.561 --> 25:05.603
The soaps in the Holiday Inn wrapper,

25:05.811 --> 25:09.728
even the toilet has a paper band on it
with a nice little note from the hotel

25:09.728 --> 25:12.936
saying they put the band on the toilet
for my protection.

25:14.019 --> 25:15.979
I'm afraid that if I stay
in bed too long,

25:15.979 --> 25:18.062
the maid walks in the room
and surround me and

25:18.062 --> 25:19.687
the breadspread with a paper band.

25:19.687 --> 25:20.520
I don't mind.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.229
You wait. After a while you won't
know what city you are in.

25:23.229 --> 25:26.770
I defy anyone to tell me the difference
between the Holiday Inn in Houston

25:26.770 --> 25:30.021
and the Holiday Inn in Cincinnati.
The rooms are the same.

25:30.021 --> 25:31.855
The music in the elevators
is the same,

25:31.855 --> 25:34.938
even the ladies with too much makeup
in the coffee shop are the same.

25:34.938 --> 25:37.396
You never know where you are
until after breakfast,

25:37.396 --> 25:39.688
- when you read the paper.
- I don't mind it.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.230
Well, I don't mind it that much, either.

25:42.230 --> 25:45.439
It's just that I would like it all to be
with someone I care for,

25:45.439 --> 25:47.147
someone I could share it with.

25:47.147 --> 25:49.647
- Bullshit.
- You're so damn cynical.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.981
I'm not cynical. It's just that your act
could use a little polish.

25:52.981 --> 25:55.272
- What do you mean by that?
- Liz Haller, for starter.

25:55.272 --> 25:57.356
It was at the California Primary?

25:57.564 --> 26:01.690
I believe you used the one about both
witnessing to the unfolding of history.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.940
You've got to admit it's better
than soap wrappers.

26:03.940 --> 26:06.315
You think all I wanna do is jump you.

26:06.648 --> 26:07.648
Yes.

26:07.982 --> 26:10.523
You wouldn't know sincerity
if it ran over you.

26:10.690 --> 26:13.608
- Not if you were driving it.
- I'm glad I'm not like you.

26:13.608 --> 26:15.066
I have better legs.

26:15.858 --> 26:17.358
Okay, I give up.

26:18.483 --> 26:22.108
Don't give up so easily,
just change your approach.

26:22.316 --> 26:23.816
What approach would you like?

26:24.483 --> 26:27.775
How about something like, uh,
'I would like to jump you'?

26:27.775 --> 26:28.859
Think that would work?

26:28.859 --> 26:31.859
It has more chance than wanting
to share a life together.

26:31.859 --> 26:33.942
- I would like to jump you.
- Go jump yourself.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.818
I'm sorry that you had to wait outside
the house all day like this.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.235
There is not much that I can say
except that

26:48.568 --> 26:50.860
I'm very excited
and proud.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.693
Everything seems to be going
smoothly.

26:53.693 --> 26:57.861
Dr. Kelloway called to say that Bru
and the crew were in excellent spirits.

26:58.194 --> 27:00.652
How has all this disrupted
your family routine?

27:01.152 --> 27:02.694
- Terrific question.
- Shove it!

27:03.027 --> 27:06.069
Well, the children will continue
to go to school

27:06.152 --> 27:09.069
and we'll try to maintain
a normal existence.

27:12.862 --> 27:14.903
I suppose that's all that I have to say.

27:14.903 --> 27:16.487
Thank you all for coming.

27:16.487 --> 27:19.487
Uh, I just came out to say hello
and go back inside now.

27:19.945 --> 27:21.528
Thank you. Goodbye.

27:41.947 --> 27:42.947
Dr. Bergen?

27:44.489 --> 27:46.780
- Yes, Elliot?
- I wonder if I could talk to you

27:46.780 --> 27:48.405
- for a moment.
- What is it?

27:48.864 --> 27:51.572
Well, there's somethin'...
I have a problem, sir.

27:51.572 --> 27:54.406
- Oh, are you feeling all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. It's the readout.

27:55.448 --> 27:56.823
What about the readout?

27:56.823 --> 27:59.240
Well, I, I just can't figure
something out.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.365
- Well, perhaps I can be of some help.
- Well, I hope so.

28:02.365 --> 28:05.240
See, I ran a check on the transmission,
on my own on the signals.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.781
- On your own?
- Yes, sir.

28:06.781 --> 28:09.116
- I like your dedication.
- The readout...

28:09.116 --> 28:12.241
The television signals are coming in
ahead of the spacecraft signals.

28:12.241 --> 28:14.282
It's like they're closer or something.

28:14.282 --> 28:17.699
Oh, that's not possible. There must be
some malfunction in your equipment.

28:17.699 --> 28:21.116
Well, I don't think so, Dr. Bergen. You
see, I doubled checked that console.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.825
- Which console are you on?
- Thirty-six, sir.

28:23.825 --> 28:25.325
Well, that's the answer.

28:25.325 --> 28:27.908
We've been having problems
with the circuitry on thirty-six.

28:27.908 --> 28:31.117
We've had trouble with it before.
I'll make sure it's repaired and,

28:31.117 --> 28:34.950
thank you for showing me the problem.
You have initiative, I like that.

29:23.121 --> 29:25.412
<i>This is Paul Cunningham.
Capricorn Control.</i>

29:25.412 --> 29:29.954
<i>We are at Tplus one 131 days

<i>In just a few minutes</i>

29:36.955 --> 29:39.622
<i>we should be receiving a signal

29:40.122 --> 29:43.122
<i>It's important to know that it takes
- 21 mins. for the signal</i>

29:43.122 --> 29:44.372
<i>from Mars to reach Earth.</i>

29:44.372 --> 29:47.080
<i>We have no way of communicating
with Capricorn One</i>

29:47.330 --> 29:50.456
<i>and what we will see actually
happened 21 mins. ago.</i>

29:50.456 --> 29:52.039
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

29:52.289 --> 29:53.623
We're getting something now.

29:54.248 --> 29:57.206
We are changing to a secondary
frequency.

29:57.206 --> 29:59.164
<i>Houston, this is Capricorn One.</i>

29:59.164 --> 30:01.456
<i>CM-LM separation was normal.</i>

30:01.706 --> 30:04.582
<i>I have CM visual contact
through port window.</i>

30:04.874 --> 30:07.582
<i>Delta-Vburn time: 3.3 secs.</i>

30:07.582 --> 30:10.290
<i>3.3 secs. Burn is correct.</i>

30:10.665 --> 30:13.832
<i>We should be hearing from
the CM... soon.</i>

30:13.957 --> 30:15.874
<i>- Houston, this is Capricorn CM.
- Just wait.</i>

30:15.874 --> 30:17.250
<i>I see the LM.</i>

30:17.250 --> 30:20.416
5 mins. after the landing,
that asshole Price'll be callin'

30:20.416 --> 30:22.791
to tell me how pleased
the President is.

30:23.041 --> 30:27.083
If our data is correct, their altitude
is 2.2 miles,

30:27.083 --> 30:29.375
pitch angle, 20 degrees.

30:29.791 --> 30:33.459
Vertical descent 44.6 feet per second.

30:34.001 --> 30:38.876
<i>We have passed Low Gate.
Altitude: 950 feet. Looking good.</i>

30:39.417 --> 30:41.876
<i>- 15 secs.

31:06.044 --> 31:07.211
<i>We have landed.</i>

31:38.421 --> 31:41.463
<i>- Yes?
- Vice President Price on the line.</i>

31:44.589 --> 31:45.589
Hello.

31:46.797 --> 31:48.381
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

31:49.964 --> 31:51.547
Yes, it's wonderful, isn't it?

31:52.381 --> 31:54.381
Proud moment for all Americans.

31:56.506 --> 31:59.298
You can tell the President
that's very gracious of him.

31:59.507 --> 32:01.382
I appreciate it, I really do.

32:03.007 --> 32:04.007
Thank you.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.590
And my very best to your lovely wife.

32:07.798 --> 32:08.715
Yes.

32:09.548 --> 32:10.548
Goodbye.

32:13.674 --> 32:14.883
Asshole.

32:26.467 --> 32:28.675
Dr., I wonder if I can speak
to you for a moment.

32:28.675 --> 32:30.550
Certainly, what seems to be
the problem?

32:30.717 --> 32:33.134
Well, I just can't figure
something out, sir.

32:33.467 --> 32:34.467
What is that?

32:35.717 --> 32:38.717
Well, I'm not exactly sure,
but it's the readout.

32:38.717 --> 32:43.093
I told Dr. Bergen about it a long time
and he said it was in the console.

32:43.718 --> 32:45.260
I'd like you to take a look at it.

32:46.010 --> 32:49.135
- Well, what console are you on?
- Telemetry, sir, thirty-six.

32:49.135 --> 32:53.176
Oh, yes, Dr. Bergen told me about that.
We had that console repaired.

32:53.176 --> 32:54.886
I know, sir, it's just...

32:54.886 --> 32:56.636
I keep on having the same readouts.

32:57.219 --> 32:59.136
Well, what readout?

32:59.761 --> 33:03.511
Well, sir, I ran a program on my own
just to check something

33:03.511 --> 33:05.427
and the readout is different.

33:06.511 --> 33:08.136
You ran your own program?

33:09.345 --> 33:10.428
Yes, sir,

33:11.887 --> 33:13.137
and...

33:13.637 --> 33:15.178
I don't think it's the console.

33:17.512 --> 33:20.345
Well, we'll have it shut down and
I'll see that it's serviced.

33:20.345 --> 33:23.012
Thank you, Elliot, for bringing
the matter to my attention.

33:26.929 --> 33:28.221
You're welcome, sir.

33:41.305 --> 33:43.764

<i>for the first DVA on

37:15.320 --> 37:18.445
<i>by showing us how high
we can reach.</i>

37:19.695 --> 37:22.654
<i>You have crossed
the last great frontier</i>

37:23.237 --> 37:25.320
<i>and you have shown us
what we are:</i>

37:25.820 --> 37:26.820
<i>People.</i>

37:27.238 --> 37:30.530
<i>Of different colors and religions
and ideologies,</i>

37:31.071 --> 37:33.696
<i>however, a single people.</i>

37:34.821 --> 37:36.988
<i>You are the basic truth in us.</i>

37:37.446 --> 37:39.196
<i>You are the reality.</i>

37:40.530 --> 37:42.906
<i>We will never let you down</i>

37:43.864 --> 37:46.489
<i>and we will always be grateful."</i>

37:56.032 --> 37:58.698
I have decided after
a careful deliberation

37:58.698 --> 38:01.157
and a painful soul-searching
to give you an opportunity

38:01.157 --> 38:03.823
- to win your 50 dollars back.
- I don't feel like playing.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.948
- Eight ball, five dollars a game.
- I don't feel like it.

38:06.948 --> 38:08.490
- 10 dollars.
- I'm serious.

38:08.490 --> 38:11.324
So am I. I'll even let you break.
Can a person be more serious?

38:11.324 --> 38:12.158
You're drunk.

38:12.158 --> 38:14.366
I knew there was a reason
I was feeling this good.

38:14.366 --> 38:15.824
I need a drink.

38:16.074 --> 38:19.116
Underneath that wash and wear shirt,
you have some heart.

38:19.116 --> 38:21.408
It may be sanforized, but it's a heart.

38:23.324 --> 38:24.241
Mike?

38:36.534 --> 38:39.076
- You said I break.
- I must'a' been drunk.

38:45.451 --> 38:48.076
- Hard day at the office, dear?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.701
- Did you break your slide rule?
- I'm not really sure.

38:51.701 --> 38:53.827
I ran a check on my own
transmissions signals.

38:53.827 --> 38:56.369
The numbers came up screwy,
so I told Dr. Bergen about it.

38:56.369 --> 38:58.661
It was like he was pissed at me
for running a check.

38:58.744 --> 39:00.702
He said it must be a console
malfunctioning.

39:00.702 --> 39:03.411
So I told Dr. Kelloway about it
and he said the same thing.

39:03.411 --> 39:05.827
Big deal. What did you expect,
a merit badge?

39:05.827 --> 39:08.703
I guess so.
They must know what they're doing.

39:08.912 --> 39:11.578
Those numbers couldn't have been
right anyway. No way.

39:11.578 --> 39:13.828
If you know the numbers
couldn't have been right,

39:13.828 --> 39:15.078
why are you so upset?

39:15.328 --> 39:18.120
It was the way they reacted.
No double check or anything.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.745
They looked at me like I was a kid
and offered me a cookie.

39:20.745 --> 39:23.663
- What were the numbers?
- I have to admit it is ridiculous.

39:23.954 --> 39:25.413
Good, let's play pool.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.788
Those signals couldn't have
come from 300 miles.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.954
Which signals?

39:35.996 --> 39:37.622
The television transmission.

39:38.164 --> 39:41.330
I think I just sobered up. Would you
tell me what you just told me again?

39:41.330 --> 39:43.205
<i>Hey, Caulfield, telephone.</i>

39:49.997 --> 39:50.956
Hello?

39:52.331 --> 39:53.706
Yes, this is Caulfield.

39:54.873 --> 39:55.706
What?

39:56.790 --> 39:58.998
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak
more clearly.

39:58.998 --> 40:02.165
I think we have a bad connection
or something. I can't hear you.

40:03.665 --> 40:04.665
Who?

40:06.374 --> 40:08.082
I don't understand what you want.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.957
Look, if you call the assignment desk,

40:11.957 --> 40:14.541
they'll be glad to send someone over
to cover that for you.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.749
Yes, ask for the assignment desk.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.083
Assignment. That's right.

40:20.875 --> 40:21.917
You're welcome.

40:39.168 --> 40:40.376
Anybody hungry?

40:41.459 --> 40:42.584
No.

40:44.251 --> 40:46.668
Oh, the marvels of american
science.

40:48.085 --> 40:51.127
Here we are, millions of miles
from the Earth

40:51.877 --> 40:54.002
and we can still send out for a pizza.

40:55.044 --> 40:56.502
I'm not gonna do it.

40:57.335 --> 40:58.502
Not gonna do what?

40:58.794 --> 41:01.085
Tomorrow, I'm not gonna sit
in this thing

41:01.085 --> 41:03.795
and talk to my wife and tell her
everything is going fine.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.503
I'm not gonna do it.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.503
I tried.

41:11.586 --> 41:14.503
I got two little kids with big bright eyes.

41:15.503 --> 41:18.796
And I used to tell them their daddy
was gonna make them proud of him

41:19.921 --> 41:21.629
like he was of them.

41:22.337 --> 41:23.962
And now I gotta go home,

41:24.379 --> 41:26.962
I gotta kiss them and
gotta look in their eyes

41:27.587 --> 41:29.421
and tell them I really did this?

41:32.463 --> 41:36.130
I don't know. Maybe that's better that
telling them I really didn't do it.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.672
I wish I knew what was right.
I really don't.

41:40.880 --> 41:44.297
We've been sitting around here for
months, telling their lies for them.

41:46.298 --> 41:48.339
And I don't wanna do it any more.

41:49.506 --> 41:52.798
<i>Okay, so we go and blow the whole
thing tomorrow, on national TV,</i>

41:52.798 --> 41:53.839
<i>then what have we done?</i>

41:54.048 --> 41:57.631
- We'd screw up a lotta people's dinner.
- We've already screwed ourselves.

41:57.839 --> 42:00.757
Okay, so what do we accomplish
by screwing everybody else?

42:00.757 --> 42:04.090
He's got a point there, you know.
We went along with this for you.

42:04.757 --> 42:06.257
You and our families.

42:07.090 --> 42:10.424
Now you wanna go out in
some terrific blaze of glory?

42:11.299 --> 42:13.257
And we get pulverized in the process?

42:16.550 --> 42:17.883
And our families?

42:22.633 --> 42:24.800
- What about our families?
- I know!

42:32.092 --> 42:33.092
I know.

42:34.259 --> 42:35.259
<i>Shit!</i>

42:35.551 --> 42:38.509
<i>That's the best thing I've heard
anybody say in three weeks.</i>

42:38.509 --> 42:40.217
<i>- What's the best thing?
- Shit.</i>

42:40.217 --> 42:41.926
<i>I just don't think I can do it.</i>

42:41.926 --> 42:43.385
Get me Dr. Kelloway.

42:43.677 --> 42:46.177
Why, all of a sudden,
are we standing up for the bad guys

42:46.177 --> 42:48.093
and you're on the side
of truth and justice?

42:48.093 --> 42:50.885
We may have a problem with
Brubaker tomorrow.

42:51.468 --> 42:54.552
- I wish I had the words.
- Damn the words, Bru!

42:56.635 --> 42:58.844
These people... they're capable
of anything.

42:59.219 --> 43:01.136
And we got our families out there.

43:01.594 --> 43:04.594
Now, we're in this thing and I think
we're in too deep to stop now.

43:05.178 --> 43:07.094
No one os us is gonna decide.

43:08.553 --> 43:10.053
It's got to be all of us.

43:14.179 --> 43:17.387
Operator, I'm trying a number now
for over an hour and it's busy.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.887
Would you kindly check to see
if it's out of order?

43:20.970 --> 43:22.762
I know you don't do that.

43:23.095 --> 43:24.595
Yes, it's an emergency.

43:25.595 --> 43:29.180
Thank you. 8733657.

43:29.971 --> 43:33.305
No, 3657, Mr. Elliot Whitter.

43:40.096 --> 43:41.181
Out of order?

43:42.097 --> 43:43.514
Thank you very much, operator.

43:46.431 --> 43:49.056
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,

<i>Roger, Houston,

44:17.933 --> 44:19.558
<i>Houston, do you have a picture?</i>

44:19.558 --> 44:21.474
Roger, Capricorn, we have a picture.

44:21.474 --> 44:24.434
We have three anxious ladies here
who would like to talk to you.

44:24.767 --> 44:25.892
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

44:26.309 --> 44:28.017
<i>We'd sure like to talk to them.</i>

44:28.142 --> 44:30.684
Okay, go ahead, but keep it short.

44:30.684 --> 44:32.934
Remember, this is long distance.

44:33.725 --> 44:34.600
Jack?

44:36.059 --> 44:37.392
Jack, it's Betty.

44:37.392 --> 44:40.268
<i>- Hey, Betty, how are you?
- You look fine.</i>

44:40.518 --> 44:44.560
<i>Thanks. You know we can't see you
up here, but you sure sound terrific.</i>

44:44.810 --> 44:47.560
I miss you. So do the kids.

44:49.310 --> 44:51.726
<i>Okay, I miss them too,
more than you all know.</i>

44:52.894 --> 44:53.727
Peter?

44:55.019 --> 44:55.894
It's Sharon.

44:56.227 --> 44:57.852
<i>I told you never to call me here.</i>

44:58.311 --> 44:59.394
Are you feeling well?

44:59.894 --> 45:01.102
<i>I'm feeling very well.</i>

45:01.602 --> 45:02.852
<i>How's Sandy?</i>

45:03.269 --> 45:06.144
Well, she's got the part of Wendy
in her school play.

45:06.144 --> 45:08.020
They're doing Peter Pan.

45:08.020 --> 45:09.062
<i>That's terrific.</i>

45:09.853 --> 45:11.228
You sound so close.

45:11.687 --> 45:14.812
It's hard to believe you really are
that far away in space.

45:15.062 --> 45:16.645
<i>It's hard for me to believe it, too.</i>

45:18.145 --> 45:19.020
Bru?

45:19.103 --> 45:20.145
<i>Hello, Kay.</i>

45:20.520 --> 45:22.021
We're all so proud of you.

45:23.354 --> 45:24.646
Can you hear me, Bru?

45:25.854 --> 45:26.688
<i>Yes.</i>

45:28.938 --> 45:31.354
- I'm not sure of Brubaker.
- Keep watching.

45:31.688 --> 45:34.354
Bru? I have a surprise for you.

45:34.604 --> 45:35.439
<i>What?</i>

45:36.647 --> 45:39.939
I said I have a surprise for you.

45:40.522 --> 45:41.480
<i>What is it?</i>

45:41.772 --> 45:45.689
Charles wrote a composition in school
and he won an award.

45:46.397 --> 45:47.647
May I read it to you?

45:50.356 --> 45:51.815
Bru, can you hear me?

45:52.231 --> 45:53.315
<i>Yes...</i>

45:55.273 --> 45:56.440
<i>please, read it to me.</i>

45:56.731 --> 45:58.815
It doesn't look good.
Do I cut the transmission?

45:58.981 --> 46:00.440
Not until I tell you.

46:00.773 --> 46:04.816
'My father, by Charles Brubaker, Jr.'

46:06.816 --> 46:09.316
'My father is far away from me now.

46:10.399 --> 46:11.774
He is flying to Mars.

46:12.316 --> 46:13.982
<i>I miss him very much.</i>

46:14.649 --> 46:16.774
<i>I always miss him when
he goes away.</i>

46:17.816 --> 46:19.400
<i>I'm not sad, though.</i>

46:20.025 --> 46:22.192
<i>I used to be sad when
he went away.</i>

46:23.275 --> 46:27.567
One day he told me that people
can't live only for themselves.

46:28.317 --> 46:32.484
He said he was trying to do something
that would be good for everybody.

46:34.151 --> 46:37.568
<i>I know that is what
he is doing now.</i>

46:38.401 --> 46:42.068
<i>He is doing something for
everybody, to give them a better life.</i>

46:43.276 --> 46:45.776
<i>That means he is doing something
for me, too.</i>

46:46.734 --> 46:48.902
So even though he is far away,

46:49.652 --> 46:52.027
he is thinking about me
and I am with him.

46:54.027 --> 46:55.694
That is why I'm not sad.

46:56.069 --> 46:58.360
That is why I'm so proud of my Dad.

46:58.569 --> 46:59.819
I love him so much.'

47:01.486 --> 47:02.320
Kay.

47:04.903 --> 47:05.528
What is it?

47:07.653 --> 47:08.986
There's something I...

47:10.028 --> 47:11.111
I wanna say.

47:13.736 --> 47:14.611
<i>Bru?</i>

47:15.987 --> 47:16.987
<i>What is it?</i>

47:19.112 --> 47:20.404
Not until I tell you.

47:21.154 --> 47:24.154
I know this hasn't been easy
for you and the kids.

47:27.279 --> 47:28.779
I want you to know

47:30.072 --> 47:31.155
I love you.

47:31.863 --> 47:35.863
<i>Tell Charles thanks for
the composition, please.</i>

47:35.863 --> 47:36.738
I will.

47:37.113 --> 47:38.613
Tell him when I get back,

47:41.780 --> 47:44.030
I'm gonna take him to Yosemite again,

47:45.614 --> 47:46.864
like last summer.

47:50.239 --> 47:51.031
I will.

47:51.406 --> 47:53.239
<i>And I want you to know
that I love you.</i>

47:54.531 --> 47:55.656
<i>Very much.</i>

47:59.365 --> 48:00.699
Time's up, gentlemen.

48:01.282 --> 48:02.532
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

48:02.699 --> 48:05.115
The next time we see you,
you'll be on the way home.

48:05.282 --> 48:07.657
<i>- Roger.
- Well done, Capricorn.</i>

48:41.284 --> 48:42.160
Yes?

48:42.952 --> 48:45.202
Is Whitter in?
Tell him it's Caulfield.

48:45.410 --> 48:47.702
- Who?
- Whitter. Elliot Whitter.

48:48.910 --> 48:50.618
There's no one here by that name.

48:50.618 --> 48:52.368
You must have the wrong apartment.

48:52.368 --> 48:54.702
Well, this is apartment 228,
isn't it?

48:54.993 --> 48:58.036
Yeah. Oh, you probably have
the wrong building.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.828
You know, they are all sorta look alike.

48:59.828 --> 49:03.453
Yeah, that's right.
This is 4311 Claridge, isn't it?

49:03.911 --> 49:05.078
Yeah, it is.

49:05.078 --> 49:09.078
Elliot Whitter lives at 4311 Claridge,
in apartment 228.

49:10.119 --> 49:11.162
Is this a joke?

49:11.829 --> 49:13.579
Look, I've been here a million times.

49:13.579 --> 49:16.079
Elliot's a friend of mine and
he lives in this apartment!

49:16.454 --> 49:19.537
Look, Mister..., whoever you are.
I'm cleaning an oven.

49:19.745 --> 49:22.954
It's my oven. It's in my kitchen.
In my apartment.

49:23.120 --> 49:25.163
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get back to it.

49:25.163 --> 49:28.788
Wait a minute! Just wait! Look, I'm not
a crazy person and I'm not a mugger!

49:28.788 --> 49:31.746
I'm looking for my friend and he lives
in this apartment! I swear it!

49:31.746 --> 49:34.705
Would you get your foot out of my door
or I'm gonna call the police!

49:34.705 --> 49:36.455
Now I don't think this is
funny any more!

49:36.455 --> 49:39.456
Wait. I can prove I've been here before.
I know this apartment.

50:12.916 --> 50:15.833
Now, will you get outta here,
or do I have to call the police?

52:23.217 --> 52:25.675
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.</i>

52:25.675 --> 52:29.258
<i>We are 259 days 14 hrs. 12 mins.
into the flight.</i>

52:29.258 --> 52:31.718
<i>All systems are normal.
All lights are green.</i>

52:31.718 --> 52:35.009
<i>The prime recovery ship,
the U.S.S. Oriskany, is in position.</i>

52:35.343 --> 52:37.801
<i>An on-target landing should result
in recovery time</i>

52:37.801 --> 52:40.884
<i>of 18 mins. from splash-down
to the opening of the hatch.</i>

52:41.176 --> 52:43.968
<i>After the crew delivers its speech
on the Oriskany deck</i>

52:43.968 --> 52:46.594
<i>and is welcomed aboard
by Captain Earl Marks,</i>

52:46.594 --> 52:49.302
<i>they'll be taken below deck
for a medical debriefing.</i>

52:49.469 --> 52:51.802
<i>Tonight, at 8 o'clock
Pacific Daylight Time,</i>

52:51.802 --> 52:54.969
<i>the crew will attend the victory
banquet topped by a special dessert,</i>

52:54.969 --> 52:58.135
<i>a 40 feet red cake,
depicting the Martian surface.</i>

52:58.635 --> 53:02.636
<i>We are 23 mins. 12 secs. from
the beginning of the re-entry phase.</i>

53:02.803 --> 53:04.511
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

53:06.803 --> 53:08.511
We have a chopper waiting
on the island

53:08.511 --> 53:11.220
to take you to the spacecraft
when it splashes down.

53:11.636 --> 53:15.471
It'll take the Oriskany about 1.30 hr. To
reach you, so there won't be any rush.

53:15.971 --> 53:17.346
All lights are green.

53:17.804 --> 53:19.887
<i>Roger. All green.</i>

53:20.054 --> 53:22.054
Separation thruster check list?
De propulsor?

53:22.679 --> 53:24.471
<i>Separation thruster check list.</i>

53:25.304 --> 53:26.721
<i>Outboard thrusters.</i>

53:27.262 --> 53:29.055
<i>Outboard thrusters on.</i>

53:29.722 --> 53:31.222
<i>Inboard thrusters.</i>

53:31.722 --> 53:34.013
<i>- Inboard thrusters on.
- How we doin'?</i>

53:34.222 --> 53:36.180
We might have a slight problem, sir.

53:36.180 --> 53:38.722
- What is it?
- They're a little bit off target.

53:39.930 --> 53:40.930
How far off?

53:47.348 --> 53:50.056
- As much as 200 miles.
- That far?

53:50.764 --> 53:54.306
It could take up to 1.30 hr. For
the recovery forces to reach them.

53:55.556 --> 53:57.515
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

53:57.515 --> 53:58.432
Six...

53:58.682 --> 53:59.682
five...

53:59.890 --> 54:01.765
four...
three...

54:02.265 --> 54:03.140
two...

54:07.182 --> 54:09.015
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

54:09.640 --> 54:12.058
Capricorn One, we show red
on the heat shield.

54:12.058 --> 54:13.058
<i>Do you copy?</i>

54:14.058 --> 54:15.891
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

54:15.891 --> 54:18.308
We show red on the heat shield.
Do you read?

54:18.766 --> 54:20.766
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

54:20.766 --> 54:24.350
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
We show red on the heat shield.

54:24.350 --> 54:25.683
Do you copy?

54:27.767 --> 54:29.684
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

54:31.101 --> 54:34.392
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

54:36.267 --> 54:38.351
- Capricorn One...
- That is, Kelloway.

54:40.142 --> 54:42.685
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Do you read?

54:45.768 --> 54:47.852
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

54:49.477 --> 54:52.685
Capricorn One, we show red on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

54:54.643 --> 54:58.394
Capricorn One, this is Houston.
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

54:59.811 --> 55:02.228
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

55:02.894 --> 55:05.019
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

55:06.644 --> 55:09.854
Capricorn, we show red light on
the heat shield. Do you copy?

55:11.812 --> 55:13.812
Capricorn One, this is Houston.

55:14.854 --> 55:17.312
<i>This is Paul Cunningham,
Capricorn Control.</i>

55:17.312 --> 55:19.687
<i>We are advised that there appears
to be a malfunction.</i>

55:19.687 --> 55:22.437
<i>We do not know what the problem
is. We will keep you advised.</i>

55:22.437 --> 55:24.105
<i>This is Capricorn Control.</i>

55:24.438 --> 55:26.188
Charles, take Sandy and go inside.

55:26.188 --> 55:28.480
- Mom, what's...
- Charles, go inside now!

55:28.480 --> 55:30.521
- Mom...
- Charles, I said right now!

55:37.730 --> 55:39.897
<i>Capricorn One, this is Houston.</i>

56:05.357 --> 56:08.191
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement

56:08.774 --> 56:10.899
and then I will answer
your questions.

56:11.941 --> 56:13.608
It must have been re-entry.

56:14.566 --> 56:16.649
Something went wrong
during re-entry.

56:16.899 --> 56:18.733
Why haven't they told us anything?

56:18.733 --> 56:20.691
They don't want us to know
what went wrong.

56:20.691 --> 56:21.734
What went wrong?

56:21.734 --> 56:25.109
- Whe the hell is Kelloway?
- Where the hell are we?

56:25.609 --> 56:31.942
At Tplus 259 days 15 hrs. 11 mins.
in the flight of Capricorn One,

56:33.900 --> 56:37.151
which is 2 mins. 18 secs.
after interface,

56:38.360 --> 56:43.401
the heat shield light on the Mission
Control monitoring panel turned red.

56:44.151 --> 56:45.193
We...

56:47.485 --> 56:48.693
are dead.

56:49.526 --> 56:51.069
- What?
- We're dead.

56:51.652 --> 56:53.569
Shit, I was such a terrific guy!

56:53.694 --> 56:58.277
We tried to establish radio contract,
contact with the spacecraft

56:58.569 --> 57:00.069
an we were unsuccessful.

57:00.069 --> 57:03.486
It landed off course.
Why haven't they said anything to us?

57:04.153 --> 57:07.737
And if it never landed,
either the heat shield separated

57:08.028 --> 57:10.153
or the chutes never opened.

57:10.362 --> 57:11.862
Either way, we are dead.

57:12.195 --> 57:16.070
The heat shield evidently separated
from the Command Module

57:16.070 --> 57:18.613
and, as you know, the heat shield

57:18.613 --> 57:21.071
is the only protection the Module has

57:21.279 --> 57:25.446
against the heat build-up on
the re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

57:26.154 --> 57:31.029
The spacecraft disintegrated within 12
secs. after the loss of the heat shield.

57:31.404 --> 57:33.655
Right now Kelloway is making
a speech

57:33.655 --> 57:36.864
about what brave, wonderful guys...

57:37.405 --> 57:38.405
we were.

57:38.572 --> 57:41.822
I cannot adequately describe
how we feel.

57:43.530 --> 57:46.655
These men were an integral
of the family...

57:48.323 --> 57:49.656
here in the program.

57:49.865 --> 57:53.198
If anybody ever sees us again,
the whole thing falls apart.

57:53.490 --> 57:56.031
It's as simple as that.
They can't have us around.

57:56.281 --> 57:58.323
That is the end of my statement.

58:02.032 --> 58:04.699
- Have you spoken to the families?
- Yes.

58:04.699 --> 58:07.407
I don't know how we have
a lotta choice in this matter.

58:07.407 --> 58:10.199
I say we get the hell outta here.
Anybody disagree?

58:17.450 --> 58:20.033
When was the last time the heat shield
was checked?

58:22.117 --> 58:27.033
All during the re-entry phase there
were a series of status checks.

58:27.742 --> 58:31.909
All of them gave us every indication
the shield was in place.

58:46.452 --> 58:50.702
No, I have not spoken to the President
yet, but I'm sure I will very soon.

58:51.077 --> 58:53.119
I'd like to say that
the President has been

58:53.119 --> 58:58.285
a constant source of encouragement
to all of us in the program.

58:58.535 --> 59:02.495
This mission meant as much
to him as it did to us.

59:07.953 --> 59:10.661
Do you think this will end
the Manned Space Program?

59:12.536 --> 59:13.412
I don't know.

59:18.037 --> 59:21.704
You can't reach that far without
stumbling somewhere along the way.

59:25.079 --> 59:27.830
That doesn't mean that your goal
isn't worthwhile.

59:29.955 --> 59:31.913
So many people have given so much.

59:32.955 --> 59:36.955
In 1967 we had the Apollo One fire.

59:44.289 --> 59:45.498
But we didn't just...

59:46.581 --> 59:48.206
give up even though we were crushed.

01:00:02.374 --> 01:00:04.707
We went on as they would have
wanted us to.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.458
Now, these three remarkable men

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:23.666
have given their lives in an effort to...

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:26.542
widen the horizons of their species.

01:00:42.585 --> 01:00:44.710
They died striving for a goal.

01:01:02.794 --> 01:01:04.044
You tell me.

01:01:06.878 --> 01:01:10.629
I ask you... I ask all of you here.
You be the ones to tell me.

01:01:10.962 --> 01:01:14.045
How could we best serve these men?

01:01:16.212 --> 01:01:18.170
<i>By giving up on their dream?</i>

01:01:19.295 --> 01:01:20.879
<i>By saying that</i>

01:01:21.754 --> 01:01:23.463
<i>it was all for nothing?</i>

01:01:28.005 --> 01:01:29.630
<i>You give me the answer.</i>

01:01:30.255 --> 01:01:33.963
- That was the left gear we lost.
- See if you can retract the other one.

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:39.672
- Do you have any idea where we are?
- No.

01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:41.631
Which direction are we headed?

01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:45.172
West. Once we hit the coast,
we'll go North.

01:01:45.547 --> 01:01:48.631
All we've got to do is get to any city,
any place there are people,

01:01:49.464 --> 01:01:52.215
a newspaper, a television station.

01:01:52.215 --> 01:01:55.132
Any place we can show up and
be seen. Then it's over.

01:01:55.132 --> 01:01:57.215
I'm not sure it's exactly over.

01:01:57.215 --> 01:02:00.090
Our families, our kids.
They think we're dead.

01:02:01.132 --> 01:02:02.423
I wonder,

01:02:02.798 --> 01:02:05.341
when we show up,
when everybody finds up,

01:02:06.174 --> 01:02:07.883
I wonder if they'll be happy.

01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:11.799
Maybe it'd be better for them
if we were dead.

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:17.966
Oh, Christ!

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:20.634
Fuel! There's no Goddamn fuel!

01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:24.300
I told you never to take a trip
without checking the tank.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.967
- What about the reserve?
- We're on reserve.

01:02:28.175 --> 01:02:29.217
That's great.

01:02:30.717 --> 01:02:33.259
I'll start to circle.
See if you can find a lever area.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:37.385
There.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.551
Over there, beyond those cliffs.

01:02:40.176 --> 01:02:42.176
Are you sure you know
how to land this thing?

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.426
Full flaps.

01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:43.930
I think we're on Mars.

01:03:44.139 --> 01:03:46.431
We got about 20 mins.
head start on them.

01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:49.181
It's not gonna be hard to spot
this plane from the air.

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:50.973
We got two choices,

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.390
either we stick together, or we split up
and go in different directions.

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:56.806
Hey, I just found a survival kit in here.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.766
There's a can of water each.

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:10.266
A flare each.

01:04:14.141 --> 01:04:17.225
John, you take the flint.
Peter and I'll split up the matches.

01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:18.725
Anybody want the gun?

01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:20.183
I'd shoot my foot.

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.683
I'd shoot his foot.

01:04:29.393 --> 01:04:31.059
You can take the knife.

01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:36.393
Remember, if any of us gets caught,

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:38.768
or he can't make it,
shoot off a flare,

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:40.768
so the others'll know.

01:04:42.143 --> 01:04:45.644
I'll continue West. John, you go North.
Peter, you go South.

01:04:45.769 --> 01:04:47.727
We came from the East,

01:04:47.727 --> 01:04:49.727
so we know that's the wrong way.

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:51.894
There's not a lotta time.

01:04:52.477 --> 01:04:54.477
There's too much to say, so let's go.

01:04:56.144 --> 01:04:57.811
If any of us makes it...

01:04:59.145 --> 01:04:59.978
Well...

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.603
Did I ever tell you the one about
the guy who had a job giving enemas

01:05:05.603 --> 01:05:06.853
to elephants, and...?

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:10.770
Thanks.

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:17.479
Did you ever hear it?

01:05:18.146 --> 01:05:20.187
You can tell me about it
when we get home.

01:05:41.731 --> 01:05:43.398
<i>Tell Charles that...</i>

01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:47.398
<i>thank him for the composition,
please.</i>

01:05:49.814 --> 01:05:50.814
<i>I...</i>

01:05:53.148 --> 01:05:55.107
<i>Well, tell him when I get back...</i>

01:05:56.565 --> 01:05:59.482
<i>I'm gonna take him to
Yosemite again,</i>

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.065
<i>like last summer.</i>

01:06:10.608 --> 01:06:13.066
<i>- I will.
- Right there. Run it again.</i>

01:06:15.525 --> 01:06:17.025
<i>Like last summer.</i>

01:06:25.484 --> 01:06:26.484
<i>I will.</i>

01:06:30.317 --> 01:06:32.609
'Look, sir. Look, sir.

01:06:33.026 --> 01:06:36.692
Mr. Knox, sir, let's do tricks
with bricks and blocks, sir.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.943
Let's do tricks
with chicks and clocks, sir.'

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.568
- Blocks! Look, blocks!
- Right.

01:06:42.777 --> 01:06:45.318
There are the blocks
and those are the...

01:06:45.318 --> 01:06:47.485
- Clocks!
- Right.

01:06:47.485 --> 01:06:50.277
'First, I'll make a quick trick,
brick stack.

01:06:50.277 --> 01:06:52.903
Then I'll make a quick trick,
block stack.

01:06:52.903 --> 01:06:56.319
You can make a quick trick,
chick stack.

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:59.069
You can make a quick trick,
clock stack.

01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:01.528
- Chicks!
- And...?

01:07:01.653 --> 01:07:02.778
Clocks!

01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:08.654
'And here's a new trick,
Mr. Knox.

01:07:09.154 --> 01:07:12.529
Socks on chicks
and chicks on fox.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:18.404
Fox on clocks,
on bricks and blocks.

01:07:19.612 --> 01:07:23.113
Bricks and blocks
on fox and box.

01:07:28.363 --> 01:07:30.196
Now we come to

01:07:31.696 --> 01:07:33.488
ticks and tocks, sir.

01:07:37.322 --> 01:07:38.989
Try to say this,

01:07:40.572 --> 01:07:42.031
Mr. Knox, sir,

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:45.489
clocks...

01:07:46.614 --> 01:07:48.572
clocks on fix tick,

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:51.532
clocks on Knox tock.

01:07:52.365 --> 01:07:53.448
Clocks!

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.407
Clocks!

01:07:55.407 --> 01:07:56.282
Clocks.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.615
Right, Sandy, very good.

01:08:02.657 --> 01:08:04.783
'Six, sick,

01:08:06.158 --> 01:08:07.241
bricks,

01:08:08.408 --> 01:08:09.449
tick... '

01:09:21.078 --> 01:09:21.746
Yes?

01:09:21.746 --> 01:09:24.578
I'd like to see Mrs. Brubaker.
My name is Caulfield.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.746
Mrs. Brubaker isn't seeing
anyone.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.703
I telephoned this morning.
I believe I'm expected.

01:09:30.037 --> 01:09:33.205
- What was that name again?
- Caulfield. Robert Caulfield.

01:09:33.205 --> 01:09:35.497
Oh, yes. Mrs. Brubaker
is expecting you.

01:09:35.663 --> 01:09:38.038
She's out on the patio.
It's right through there.

01:09:38.038 --> 01:09:38.913
Thank you

01:09:47.872 --> 01:09:50.372
- Mrs. Brubaker?
- Mr. Caulfield?

01:09:51.206 --> 01:09:52.622
Sit down, please.

01:10:00.166 --> 01:10:02.374
Mrs. Brubaker, first of all,

01:10:02.624 --> 01:10:05.041
I'd like to say I'm really sorry.

01:10:05.041 --> 01:10:07.499
- Everyone is sor...
- I know, and I appreciate it.

01:10:08.249 --> 01:10:12.541
Don't be too uncomfortable with me.
I couldn't put up with that right now.

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:16.417
I understand that you think
you're interrupting me,

01:10:17.042 --> 01:10:20.375
and you are,
but I welcome the interruption.

01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.667
You called and said it was something
important. What is it?

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.917
Mrs. Brubaker, it may not be
important to you.

01:10:26.917 --> 01:10:29.918
I'm looking for something that may be
important to me. It's personal.

01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:32.376
You're a reporter, aren't you?

01:10:32.376 --> 01:10:35.001
Yes, as I told you,
I'm not looking for an interview.

01:10:35.501 --> 01:10:37.334
I would like to ask you
a few questions

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:40.834
about the last time you spoke with
your husband after the landing.

01:10:41.084 --> 01:10:42.294
What about it?

01:10:43.877 --> 01:10:47.752
Well, this may sound strange, Mrs.
Brubaker, don't be upset with me.

01:10:48.627 --> 01:10:51.335
Just before the conversation ended,

01:10:51.544 --> 01:10:55.210
Colonel Brubaker told you something
about going on a vacation

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:59.003
and your reaction was like you didn't
understand what he was saying.

01:10:59.003 --> 01:11:00.711
Why would you wanna know
about that?

01:11:01.253 --> 01:11:03.211
As I told you, it's something personal.

01:11:04.086 --> 01:11:05.503
It's personal to me, too.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:08.753
Please, I'm not trying to embarrass you
or anyone else.

01:11:10.503 --> 01:11:12.421
Why would any of this be
your business?

01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:13.837
Please, trust me.

01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:15.962
Why?

01:11:17.046 --> 01:11:19.212
You ask really good questions.

01:11:24.087 --> 01:11:25.797
Well, it's all so silly.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.338
It wasn't anything that dramatic.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.588
Bru just forgot something, that's all.

01:11:31.922 --> 01:11:35.838
I don't see the purpose in broadcasting
that my husband mistook a vacation

01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:38.797
when he had so many other things
to think about.

01:11:38.797 --> 01:11:41.214
No, no, no, I'm not looking for
anything to broadcast.

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:44.714
- What are you looking for?
- It has to do with a friend of mine.

01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:49.923
- Is there something I should know?
- If there was anything, I would tell you.

01:11:53.757 --> 01:11:55.132
Well, it's nothing.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.049
Bru said that he wanted to go back
to Yosemite like last year.

01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:02.007
Last year, we went to Flat Rock,
not Yosemite.

01:12:02.299 --> 01:12:05.007
I don't think there's any cosmic
significance in that.

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:10.758
Mrs. Brubaker, I truly thank you.

01:12:10.758 --> 01:12:12.383
I'm sure you had better things to do

01:12:12.383 --> 01:12:14.341
than put up with a bunch of
stupid questions.

01:12:14.341 --> 01:12:17.425
No, I didn't.
Have I been any help to you at all?

01:12:17.925 --> 01:12:20.175
I don't know.
May I call you again, sometime?

01:12:20.841 --> 01:12:21.675
Yes.

01:12:49.593 --> 01:12:50.260
Yes?

01:12:55.969 --> 01:12:57.469
There's no one inside?

01:12:58.761 --> 01:12:59.553
Are you sure?

01:13:04.594 --> 01:13:07.387
Get more personnel,
they can't go too far on foot.

01:13:26.471 --> 01:13:27.805
Oh, a piece of cake.

01:15:33.564 --> 01:15:36.772
Charles, cut it out.
You know you're bothering her.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.939
I know you're bothering her and
she knows you're bothering her.

01:15:40.147 --> 01:15:42.272
If you want to stay in the pool,
cut it out.

01:15:50.898 --> 01:15:53.106
- Hi, Uncle Jim.
- Hello there, Charles.

01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:59.899
- Hello, Kay.
- Jim.

01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:04.649
You look just fine.

01:16:04.941 --> 01:16:05.941
Thank you.

01:16:07.482 --> 01:16:09.149
Can I offer you something to drink?

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:10.482
No, thank you.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:13.858
- How are the children?
- Fine.

01:16:14.733 --> 01:16:16.275
Charles is strong.

01:16:17.192 --> 01:16:19.650
He's very much to himself,
but he's strong.

01:16:20.692 --> 01:16:22.025
Sandy doesn't know.

01:16:25.733 --> 01:16:30.526
There's gonna be a Memorial Service
on Tuesday, right here, in Houston.

01:16:30.526 --> 01:16:32.568
President... The President'll be here.

01:16:32.984 --> 01:16:35.151
- He's going to speak.
- That's nice.

01:16:35.693 --> 01:16:37.359
Will I get a folded flag?

01:16:38.318 --> 01:16:39.984
I would like you to be there.

01:16:41.319 --> 01:16:42.444
Please.

01:16:43.277 --> 01:16:46.610
I know how difficult everything is
for you right now.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:50.235
I feel like Jack the Ripper even
asking you... It's just that...

01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:55.027
it would be good for everyone
if you could go with me to the service.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.111
- It's a horrible way to die.
- No, absolutely not.

01:17:02.236 --> 01:17:06.278
When the heat shield separated,
it was over in less than 5 secs.

01:17:06.278 --> 01:17:11.154
I know that sounds grizzly, but you just
have to know he never suffered.

01:17:12.071 --> 01:17:14.446
He died doing what he wanted to do.

01:17:14.862 --> 01:17:17.946
Something he felt was important
enough to die for.

01:17:17.946 --> 01:17:19.196
I know, I know.

01:17:20.654 --> 01:17:23.487
I don't think it was important enough
for him to die for.

01:17:24.738 --> 01:17:25.863
I understand.

01:17:27.697 --> 01:17:29.697
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:17:29.697 --> 01:17:34.405
I have no right to intrude on you
like this. I'll call you tomorrow.

01:17:39.156 --> 01:17:40.198
Jim!

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.156
I'll go.

01:17:46.364 --> 01:17:48.156
You're a very special woman.

01:17:48.656 --> 01:17:50.448
He was a very special man.

01:17:51.989 --> 01:17:53.074
Thank you.

01:17:56.699 --> 01:17:58.157
- Hey, Uncle Jim!
- Yes?

01:17:58.949 --> 01:18:02.282
- My Dad went to Mars.
- Yes! Yes, he did!

01:18:13.616 --> 01:18:15.533
Oh, I'm dehydrating.

01:18:18.491 --> 01:18:19.950
Dehydrating.

01:18:22.034 --> 01:18:23.159
Sign.

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:25.784
Manual says...

01:18:27.701 --> 01:18:29.159
Iook for signs.

01:18:32.492 --> 01:18:33.617
Water.

01:18:34.951 --> 01:18:36.535
Manual says...

01:18:37.743 --> 01:18:39.410
signs for water.

01:19:00.494 --> 01:19:02.078
Oh, dried river bed.

01:19:02.786 --> 01:19:03.994
Signs.

01:19:05.954 --> 01:19:07.287
Bend in the river.

01:19:08.245 --> 01:19:09.912
Lower signs.

01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:13.287
Bend in the river.

01:19:17.995 --> 01:19:19.205
There's just...

01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:22.830
Water.

01:19:23.788 --> 01:19:26.371
River bed.

01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:34.956
Water.

01:19:38.747 --> 01:19:40.789
A drink of water.

01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:51.665
Elizabeth, there's no water.

01:19:52.748 --> 01:19:54.082
There's no water.

01:19:55.915 --> 01:19:57.540
I wanna die.

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:04.833
Elizabeth.

01:20:13.374 --> 01:20:14.333
Birds.

01:20:15.124 --> 01:20:16.375
Elizabeth,

01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:18.292
birds.

01:20:20.959 --> 01:20:22.709
I got to get the birds.

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:35.960
Helicopters...

01:21:38.422 --> 01:21:39.380
Yes?

01:21:42.256 --> 01:21:43.631
He was alone?

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:48.006
Which direction was he heading
from the airplane?

01:21:52.798 --> 01:21:55.590
Aah, look South and West only.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.674
Call everybody off North and East.

01:21:59.007 --> 01:22:01.632
The other two are South and West.

01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:07.174
- Hello, again.
- Hello, again.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.717
- Can I offer you something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

01:22:11.717 --> 01:22:16.008
- What would you like?
- Some scotch. Straight, please.

01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:18.883
You haven't found what
you're looking for,

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:20.967
you're embarrassed about
bothering me again,

01:22:20.967 --> 01:22:24.050
however there were one or two
questions more you'd like to ask me.

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:27.093
It's something personal and
you won't bother me any more.

01:22:28.259 --> 01:22:32.759
I haven't found what I'm looking for.
I feel embarrassed about bothering you.

01:22:33.176 --> 01:22:36.718
However, there are one or two more
questions I'd like to ask you.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.552
It's something personal and
I won't bother you any more.

01:22:40.677 --> 01:22:44.760
You're up to something, want my help
and you won't tell me what it is. Why?

01:22:45.385 --> 01:22:47.635
You're a very smart lady,
you know that.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.094
Yes.

01:22:49.885 --> 01:22:51.177
I drink too much.

01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:54.470
I get in trouble a lot because
I talk too much.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:58.595
Sometimes I have an imagination
that's a bit too vivid.

01:23:00.386 --> 01:23:02.678
Something's wrong and
I don't know what it is.

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:07.636
Believe me, I would never do anything
to harm you or your husband, I swear.

01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:11.221
What are you after?

01:23:15.179 --> 01:23:17.721
I'm taking a terrible risk telling you this.

01:23:17.721 --> 01:23:20.971
You may throw me out of here and
I do not want to be thrown out.

01:23:22.847 --> 01:23:26.263
I don't think your husband is the kind
of man who makes mistakes,

01:23:26.263 --> 01:23:28.222
no matter how far away he may be.

01:23:28.847 --> 01:23:30.805
I think he was trying
to tell you something.

01:23:31.972 --> 01:23:34.597
- What?
- What did you do at Flat Rock?

01:23:40.014 --> 01:23:41.223
Nothing much.

01:23:42.348 --> 01:23:44.764
We came home after one day
because Charles got sick.

01:23:44.764 --> 01:23:47.431
- What'd you do that one day?
- I don't remember.

01:23:49.473 --> 01:23:52.349
We took a tour of the town.
They have those tours.

01:23:53.265 --> 01:23:54.224
And...

01:23:56.015 --> 01:23:57.515
I don't remember what.

01:23:57.849 --> 01:24:00.182
- We took some home movies.
- Do you have them?

01:24:00.474 --> 01:24:02.307
- Yes.
- May I see them?

01:24:02.932 --> 01:24:03.765
Yes.

01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:10.266
They were making a movie
the day we were there.

01:24:10.975 --> 01:24:12.683
Bru got a big kick out of it.

01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:16.225
He never knew it took so much time
to just do one simple scene.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:21.892
Charles loves that one.
He wasn't in the greatest mood.

01:24:21.892 --> 01:24:23.601
He didn't know it but he was sick.

01:24:26.517 --> 01:24:28.601
Bru was fascinated with the detail.

01:24:29.517 --> 01:24:33.309
He couldn't get over how something
so fake could look so real.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.268
He kept on saying that with
that kind of technology

01:24:38.977 --> 01:24:41.560
you could convince people
of almost anything.

01:24:44.602 --> 01:24:46.185
There's this guy, you see!

01:24:46.352 --> 01:24:48.060
He takes a trip to Europe.

01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:51.811
It's his first vacation

01:24:52.311 --> 01:24:53.644
in a long time.

01:24:55.103 --> 01:24:56.811
He sees the sights, you know?

01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:02.811
He has a real good time.

01:25:05.979 --> 01:25:07.062
Anyway,

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.979
after a while he decides to call home.

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.854
He get his brother on the phone
and the guy says to his brother,

01:25:15.437 --> 01:25:16.937
'How's everything at home? '

01:25:17.896 --> 01:25:19.438
And his brother says,

01:25:29.521 --> 01:25:31.063
'Your... Your cat died.'

01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:34.022
And the guy says to his brother,

01:25:34.147 --> 01:25:36.814
'You shouldn't tell me
bad news like that.'

01:25:37.231 --> 01:25:38.314
'You should

01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:42.939
break it to me gently.

01:25:44.481 --> 01:25:45.522
You know...

01:25:51.523 --> 01:25:53.065
You should say something like,

01:25:55.482 --> 01:25:58.398
'The cat crawled out on the roof

01:26:00.733 --> 01:26:02.524
and the was chasing the squirrels

01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:05.316
and...

01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:08.024
he got stuck.

01:26:08.566 --> 01:26:10.483
We had to call the fire department

01:26:11.024 --> 01:26:14.149
and when they finally got there,
a fireman crawled up,

01:26:14.566 --> 01:26:16.067
he grabbed the cat

01:26:16.067 --> 01:26:20.525
and on the way down he slipped
and the cat fell to the ground.'

01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:37.401
'They had to take the cat to the vet.

01:26:42.818 --> 01:26:44.527
They tried to save the cat.

01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:49.194
They even operated

01:26:49.777 --> 01:26:50.902
on the cat.

01:26:52.486 --> 01:26:53.986
But it was too late.

01:26:57.402 --> 01:26:58.695
They couldn't

01:27:00.112 --> 01:27:01.278
save the cat.'

01:27:04.612 --> 01:27:06.278
That's how you should break

01:27:06.695 --> 01:27:08.195
bad news, like that.'

01:27:13.321 --> 01:27:15.488
So the guy says to his brother,

01:27:20.613 --> 01:27:21.696
'How's Mom? '

01:27:24.654 --> 01:27:26.071
And the brother says,

01:27:31.322 --> 01:27:32.697
'She's on the roof.

01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:50.240
Get it?

01:27:50.781 --> 01:27:52.198
She's on the roof.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.866
She's on the roof.

01:28:02.616 --> 01:28:03.741
Get it? '

01:28:34.576 --> 01:28:35.534
Yes?

01:28:37.493 --> 01:28:38.702
Which one?

01:28:41.577 --> 01:28:43.285
What direction was he going?

01:28:46.494 --> 01:28:49.952
Brubaker is going West.
Put everybody West.

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:02.536
Caulfield.

01:29:03.161 --> 01:29:04.203
Right now?

01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:05.495
Okay.

01:29:16.454 --> 01:29:18.787
How nice of you to join us here!

01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:21.497
- Listen, I think I got something.
- You need a dermatologist?

01:29:21.747 --> 01:29:23.080
Don't tell me, I'll get it.

01:29:23.247 --> 01:29:25.538
- George Raft! Right?
- Where the hell have you been?

01:29:25.538 --> 01:29:26.663
I have to talk to you.

01:29:26.663 --> 01:29:29.872
I think I'm onto something. It could be
your actual ball game. I mean it.

01:29:29.872 --> 01:29:32.163
Golly, gee, Scoop, that sounds
very interesting!

01:29:32.372 --> 01:29:34.038
Something is wrong. Something big.

01:29:34.038 --> 01:29:36.164
They know I'm onto it and
they tried to kill me.

01:29:36.164 --> 01:29:37.831
- Who's they?
- I can't tell you.

01:29:37.831 --> 01:29:39.373
- Why not?
- You wouldn't believe me.

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.498
You don't think so?

01:29:40.998 --> 01:29:43.081
Okay, listen to me.
I got a tip from a friend,

01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:44.789
a good friend, then he disappeared.

01:29:44.789 --> 01:29:45.789
Disappeared?

01:29:45.789 --> 01:29:49.039
Like he never existed. There's some
lady living in his apartment.

01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:50.624
His apartment is all different.

01:29:50.624 --> 01:29:53.040
She said she's been living there
for more than a year.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.915
I checked the building rental office.

01:29:54.915 --> 01:29:57.374
They have receipts from her
for more than a year.

01:29:57.374 --> 01:29:58.707
I checked NASA personnel.

01:29:58.707 --> 01:30:01.374
They have no record
my friend ever worked there.

01:30:01.374 --> 01:30:03.082
They say they never even heard
of him.

01:30:03.082 --> 01:30:04.290
So this friend of yours,

01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:07.083
who works at NASA,
gives you a tip, then disappears.

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:10.541
And it turns out that he never lived in
his apartment or worked at NASA.

01:30:10.541 --> 01:30:13.208
This is the guy that gave you the tip
on your cosmic scoop,

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:15.166
- and you think I won't believe you?
- My car!

01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:16.750
Someone tampered
with my car!

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:18.583
The one you decided to go
swimming with?

01:30:18.583 --> 01:30:20.751
They did something to it!
I couldn't stop it!

01:30:20.751 --> 01:30:21.876
Can you prove that?

01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:25.459
The police said...

01:30:27.042 --> 01:30:30.667
- They said that nothing was wrong.
- And you think I won't believe you.

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:32.042
Somebody took a shot at me!

01:30:32.042 --> 01:30:33.377
- When?
- Yesterday.

01:30:33.377 --> 01:30:36.168
- Thank God, I've got an alibi!
- I'm telling you the truth!

01:30:37.002 --> 01:30:39.627
Listen to me and listen good.

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:44.585
I don't like you, Caulfield.
You're ambitious.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.419
You think the way to get ahead is to
come up with the scoop of the century.

01:30:48.628 --> 01:30:52.128
Woodward and Bernstein were good
reporters. That's how they did it.

01:30:52.128 --> 01:30:55.628
Not by telling me they've located
Patty Hearst three times, like you did.

01:30:55.836 --> 01:30:59.461
Or that brilliant piece of investigative
journalism you pulled off,

01:30:59.461 --> 01:31:03.004
by finding an eyewitness to the 2nd
gunman in the Kennedy assassination.

01:31:03.004 --> 01:31:06.712
The small fact that the man had been
in a mental institution at the time,

01:31:06.712 --> 01:31:09.254
never deterred you,
not Scoop Caulfield!

01:31:10.837 --> 01:31:14.129
Now, most reporters are like me.
They are plodders.

01:31:14.129 --> 01:31:18.171
They spend a lot of their time checking
little things..., like facts.

01:31:18.463 --> 01:31:21.546
They cover mundane stories
like wars,

01:31:22.005 --> 01:31:23.546
and trials and hearings.

01:31:24.171 --> 01:31:27.171
You never seem to have enough time
in your busy schedule

01:31:27.171 --> 01:31:30.130
to stoop so low as to cover a story.

01:31:30.506 --> 01:31:34.422
You occupy your time with tips from
people who never existed,

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:38.047
driving your car into water and then
claiming it wasn't your fault,

01:31:38.047 --> 01:31:40.006
getting shot at by unseen gunmen.

01:31:40.672 --> 01:31:44.381
Now, I really hate to interrupt
your meteoric career

01:31:44.381 --> 01:31:47.715
with something so plebeian
as a legitimate story.

01:31:48.048 --> 01:31:49.090
However,

01:31:49.382 --> 01:31:52.382
a trainload of propane gas
had the bad taste

01:31:52.382 --> 01:31:56.507
to derail near Galveston and there's
a whole town that just might blow up.

01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:59.799
So it would be just really
peachy or you

01:31:59.799 --> 01:32:03.174
if you would join you film crew
that's waiting for you on the plane

01:32:03.174 --> 01:32:05.091
at this very moment while we speak.

01:32:06.258 --> 01:32:08.258
- That was a speech.
- I thought so.

01:32:08.716 --> 01:32:11.174
I cannot go to Galveston right now.

01:32:11.174 --> 01:32:12.299
I don't think I heard you.

01:32:12.966 --> 01:32:13.884
Look,

01:32:14.175 --> 01:32:17.300
when a reporter tells
his Assignment Editor

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:20.925
that he thinks he may be onto
something that could be really big,

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.425
the Assignment Editor's suppose
to say,

01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:25.050
'You got forty-eight hours, kid,

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:26.884
and you better come up
with something good

01:32:26.884 --> 01:32:28.135
or it's gonna be your neck.'

01:32:28.135 --> 01:32:30.593
That's what he's supposed to say!
I saw it in a movie!

01:32:30.593 --> 01:32:31.926
Get your ass on that plane!

01:32:31.926 --> 01:32:33.676
I can't! I have to follow this!

01:32:33.676 --> 01:32:36.260
And you can't tell me what this
earth-shattering story is?

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:39.051
It sounds too crazy.
If I told you, I'd be in more trouble.

01:32:39.051 --> 01:32:42.010
You're not crazy! I'm crazy!
I'm crazy for listening!

01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:44.469
And I'm crazy for saying what
I'm about to say!

01:32:44.469 --> 01:32:46.969
I'll give you twenty-four hours
come up with something!

01:32:46.969 --> 01:32:50.261
Not forty-eight! I saw the movie, too,
and it was twenty-four!

01:34:00.224 --> 01:34:01.224
Freeze!

01:34:02.016 --> 01:34:04.141
- I'm not moving an inch.
- Robert Caulfield?

01:34:04.141 --> 01:34:06.432
- Yeah, who the hell are you?
- Federal Agents.

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:08.350
We have a warrant to search
your apartment.

01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:11.517
- You have a warrant? What for?
- Just don't move.

01:34:11.808 --> 01:34:14.058
I promise. Just tell me
what this is all about.

01:34:14.058 --> 01:34:15.475
<i>Hey, come here! Look at this!</i>

01:34:15.642 --> 01:34:17.725
Could you come with me,
please, Mr. Caulfield?

01:34:47.269 --> 01:34:49.102
Mr. Caulfield, I'm sorry.

01:34:49.602 --> 01:34:52.353
However, you're under arrest
for possession of cocaine.

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:53.895
I don't believe it.

01:34:54.811 --> 01:34:57.436
I don't believe it. You guys put it there,
you know you did.

01:34:57.936 --> 01:34:59.645
You have the right to remain silent.

01:35:02.686 --> 01:35:05.937
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I don't believe it. You put it there.

01:35:05.937 --> 01:35:08.646
Anything you say may be held
against you in a court of law.

01:35:09.187 --> 01:35:12.062
You're part of all this. You mothers.

01:35:13.312 --> 01:35:14.521
Ow, that hurts!

01:35:14.771 --> 01:35:16.479
You don't have to put
handcuffs on me!

01:35:16.479 --> 01:35:19.312
Please, Mr. Caulfield, these are
serious charges against you.

01:35:19.312 --> 01:35:22.480
- Don't add to them by resisting arrest.
- I don't bel...! That hurts!

01:35:23.313 --> 01:35:24.813
I don't believe this.

01:35:33.772 --> 01:35:36.648
Well, hello there, Caulfield!
So nice to see you!

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:40.606
It's at this point that Alan Hale says
to Richard Conte...

01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:43.314
- Jimmy Stewart.
- Yeah, Jimmy Stewart, thank you.

01:35:43.314 --> 01:35:45.814
Look, Scoop, I can't keep bailing you
out of trouble.

01:35:45.814 --> 01:35:47.231
The front office is on my neck.

01:35:47.231 --> 01:35:50.440
I don't know how much longer
I can keep them off, right?

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.440
- Right.
- Wrong!

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.982
I got you out of there so as not to
embarrass the Network.

01:35:53.982 --> 01:35:56.857
I mean, you are a schmuck!
I can't trust you to cover a fire!

01:35:56.857 --> 01:35:58.982
You'll probably fall down
and get burned!

01:35:58.982 --> 01:36:00.815
You probably would be the cause of it!

01:36:00.815 --> 01:36:02.940
A company car? You are fired!

01:36:03.065 --> 01:36:06.983
I love that so much!
I'm gonna say it again!

01:36:06.983 --> 01:36:09.483
You're fired! You're through!
Oh, I love it!

01:36:09.483 --> 01:36:11.400
It's not what it looks like, really.

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.691
'Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn! '

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.651
I told you. You tell me about the lonely
plight of a dedicated journalist.

01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:20.776
I tell you to stuff it.

01:36:20.776 --> 01:36:22.692
You tell me about a meaningful
relationship.

01:36:22.692 --> 01:36:23.984
I tell you to stuff it.

01:36:23.984 --> 01:36:26.192
You tell me you're in trouble,
you're out on bail,

01:36:26.192 --> 01:36:28.401
you just got fired,
I tell you I'll be right over.

01:36:28.401 --> 01:36:30.192
- My head hurts.
- You look awful.

01:36:30.192 --> 01:36:32.193
- Thank you, very much.
- You're quite welcome.

01:36:32.193 --> 01:36:33.568
Did you find out what I asked?

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:37.027
One o'clock in the morning
I get a call from an unemployed junkie

01:36:37.027 --> 01:36:40.360
to find out all the military installations
in a 300 miles radius

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.402
around Houston, Texas.

01:36:41.402 --> 01:36:43.860
You certainly have a way with words.
Did you find out?

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.778
Yes, and it wasn't easy.
It took exhaustive research.

01:36:46.986 --> 01:36:48.694
Well, I'm proud of you.
How many?

01:36:48.694 --> 01:36:52.361
One. White Bluff. It's a SAC base.
My father used to be stationed there.

01:36:52.361 --> 01:36:54.069
That's exhaustive research?

01:36:54.153 --> 01:36:57.319
At one o'clock in the morning,
you call your father, that's exhaustive.

01:36:57.319 --> 01:36:59.569
- White Bluff... That's too big.
- Too big for what?

01:36:59.569 --> 01:37:01.779
- Too big for what I want.
- What do you want?

01:37:01.779 --> 01:37:03.279
I'm thinking of enlisting.

01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:06.070
- They'll never take you.
- That's why I'm thinking of enlisting.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:08.487
- You're on a story, aren't you?
- I was fired!

01:37:08.487 --> 01:37:11.279
You're on a story and I'm helping you.
This can't be happening.

01:37:11.279 --> 01:37:12.570
I really appreciate that.

01:37:12.570 --> 01:37:15.196
The only reason I'm doing it,
considering your track record,

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:17.988
whatever story you're on
will turn out to be garbage.

01:37:17.988 --> 01:37:19.655
You shouldn't mince words.

01:37:26.738 --> 01:37:28.946
I'll fix you some coffee.
Then you can jump me.

01:37:29.281 --> 01:37:31.322
There's no other one besides
White Bluff?

01:37:31.572 --> 01:37:32.489
No.

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:35.697
Except one abandoned base
they used for training

01:37:35.697 --> 01:37:38.947
during World War II, Jackson.
There's nothing there now.

01:37:38.947 --> 01:37:41.864
- Don't you want to jump me?
- Of course I do. Where's Jackson?

01:37:43.572 --> 01:37:47.198
About 300 miles directly West.
I think I'm gonna get angry with you.

01:37:47.865 --> 01:37:50.573
- Do you have any money on you?
- Do you want me to pay you?

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:52.032
How much?

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.990
About 100. Why don't I just leave it
on the dresser in the morning?

01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.990
Give it to me now.

01:37:56.365 --> 01:37:58.491
In advance?
That's the height of conceit!

01:37:58.491 --> 01:38:00.533
Please, and your car keys.

01:38:04.283 --> 01:38:06.074
You're really being terrific, why?

01:38:07.533 --> 01:38:09.699
You're not as obnoxious
when you are helpless.

01:38:09.699 --> 01:38:12.116
- Thank you very much.
- You're quite welcome.

01:38:13.992 --> 01:38:16.409
Also, Liz Haller said you were super.

01:38:16.409 --> 01:38:19.450
Well, when I get back,
we'll jump each other.

01:38:19.659 --> 01:38:20.617
Maybe.

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:23.909
I'll get arrested again.

01:38:25.159 --> 01:38:26.159
It's a deal.

01:45:08.729 --> 01:45:09.771
Mornin'.

01:45:12.354 --> 01:45:14.396
- Mornin'.
- You in charge here?

01:45:15.979 --> 01:45:17.604
- You see that sign there?
- Yes.

01:45:17.604 --> 01:45:18.646
Well, read it.

01:45:18.646 --> 01:45:19.771
- I did.
- Out loud!

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:22.604
'A and A Crop Dusting Service'.

01:45:22.939 --> 01:45:24.564
You wanna know who I am?

01:45:25.064 --> 01:45:26.730
I'll bet you're one of the 'As'.

01:45:26.730 --> 01:45:29.730
Well, which one? I'll bet you can't
answer that question, smart-ass!

01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:30.980
- The first one.
- Wrong!

01:45:31.397 --> 01:45:33.980
- Can I have one more gues?
- You got it.

01:45:34.272 --> 01:45:35.522
The second one.

01:45:36.147 --> 01:45:40.231
Wrong. I'm both of 'em!
'A' and 'A'. My name is Albain.

01:45:40.481 --> 01:45:44.981
I got a son. The other 'A' was for him,
but he don't like to fly and is a lawyer.

01:45:44.981 --> 01:45:46.940
He's a pervert, so I took the 'A'
away.

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:49.648
Wanna speak to somebody in charge?
You're speakin' to both o' them.

01:45:49.898 --> 01:45:52.899
- My name is Caulfield.
- Hey, I can't help that.

01:45:52.899 --> 01:45:55.441
Mr. Albain, how much do you charge
to dust a field?

01:45:55.441 --> 01:45:57.941
- 25 dollars.
- I'd like to hire your plane.

01:45:58.274 --> 01:46:01.232
- That'll be 100 dollars.
- You said you charged 25.

01:46:01.607 --> 01:46:05.399
25 dollars t' dust a field, but you ain't
got no field because you ain't a farmer,

01:46:05.399 --> 01:46:08.067
which means you ain't poor
and I think you're a pervert!

01:46:09.233 --> 01:46:10.650
Okay, 100.

01:46:10.650 --> 01:46:12.608
- 125.
- What?

01:46:12.608 --> 01:46:15.025
Because you said 'yes' to 100
too quick,

01:46:15.025 --> 01:46:16.942
which means you can afford 125!

01:46:24.193 --> 01:46:25.651
Where do you wanna go,
smart-ass?

01:46:25.651 --> 01:46:27.818
I'm not sure. I'm looking for someone
who's lost.

01:46:27.818 --> 01:46:28.943
It's your money.

01:48:02.033 --> 01:48:05.158
Put your Goddamn head down
so I can see!

01:48:05.158 --> 01:48:07.033
Why didn't you sit in front?

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:09.616
- You know how to fly?
- No!

01:48:10.158 --> 01:48:12.241
Then I gotta sit in back

01:48:12.241 --> 01:48:15.784
and you gotta put your Goddamn
head down, smart-ass!

01:48:55.244 --> 01:48:57.619
Now, what the hell is your friend doin'
out here?

01:48:57.619 --> 01:48:58.745
He's lost!

01:48:59.787 --> 01:49:02.079
- He rob a bank or somethin'?
- No!

01:49:03.162 --> 01:49:05.287
- Well, I get a third!
- What?

01:49:05.579 --> 01:49:08.037
We find him, I get a third of the loot!

01:49:08.037 --> 01:49:10.120
Now, keep your Goddamn head down!

01:50:01.374 --> 01:50:03.749
You think we should go
in another direction?

01:50:03.749 --> 01:50:05.124
- Hey!
- What?

01:50:05.124 --> 01:50:06.874
- Over there!
- Where?

01:50:07.208 --> 01:50:08.541
Helicopters!

01:50:08.624 --> 01:50:10.792
I seen them fly around here
last couple of days!

01:50:10.959 --> 01:50:13.250
- Let's follow 'em!
- I would if I could see 'em!

01:51:18.129 --> 01:51:19.963
They're goin' down over there!

01:51:49.048 --> 01:51:50.674
He must be in there!

01:51:51.257 --> 01:51:52.424
Let's go down.

01:51:53.591 --> 01:51:55.341
They got guns, Sonny!

01:51:56.049 --> 01:51:58.382
You said you wanted a third of the loot!

01:51:59.216 --> 01:52:01.632
- Half!
- Okay, half!

01:55:03.395 --> 01:55:05.437
Keep your Goddamn head down!

01:57:10.446 --> 01:57:13.696
Pull that lever down by your feet
when I tell you, Sonny!

01:57:23.655 --> 01:57:24.780
Now!

01:57:57.074 --> 01:57:58.282
Perverts!

01:57:59.199 --> 01:58:00.782
Remember, I get half!

01:58:08.825 --> 01:58:10.200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:11.533
<i>Mrs. Brubaker</i>

01:58:11.867 --> 01:58:14.200
<i>Mrs. Willis, Mrs. Walker,</i>

01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:16.450
<i>my fellow Americans.</i>

01:58:17.242 --> 01:58:20.659
<i>I come here today to talk of
unfinished hopes</i>

01:58:21.284 --> 01:58:23.284
<i>and of unfulfilled dreams.</i>

01:58:23.826 --> 01:58:27.493
<i>Charles Brubaker, Peter Willis
and John Walker</i>

01:58:27.993 --> 01:58:32.160
<i>left this Earth for their dream
a little more than eight months ago.</i>

01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:34.702
<i>They were never able
to return to us.</i>

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:38.744
Their dream was able to grow
and flourish

01:58:39.244 --> 01:58:42.577
because of the support of millions
of citizens

01:58:42.577 --> 01:58:43.702
all across America

01:58:44.535 --> 01:58:47.995
at a time when cynicism was
a national epidemic,

01:58:49.036 --> 01:58:52.036
they gave us something
to take pride in.

01:58:53.161 --> 01:58:56.745
It is a dream that
should not be allowed to die.

01:58:58.411 --> 01:59:01.829
A nation is built on the spirit
of its people.

01:59:02.996 --> 01:59:05.162
The test of the greatness
of any nation

01:59:05.496 --> 01:59:08.454
is how that nation pulls together
in a time of crisis.

01:59:09.621 --> 01:59:12.162
The only limits on what
we can achieve

01:59:12.162 --> 01:59:14.871
are the limits we place on our hopes.

01:59:15.538 --> 01:59:20.830
These three men reminded us
of the limitlessness of our hopes.

01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:24.955
There was a moment
in these past few days

01:59:25.413 --> 01:59:28.247
when we were all one people.

01:59:28.705 --> 01:59:30.831
We were all hoping,

01:59:31.373 --> 01:59:33.414
we were all a little bit taller,

01:59:33.998 --> 01:59:35.539
a little bit prouder.

01:59:35.956 --> 01:59:39.789
We were all feeling the same fears
and the same exhilaration.

01:59:40.248 --> 01:59:42.789
These three men brought us together.

01:59:42.789 --> 01:59:46.999
We knew together that
there are no goals we cannot reach

01:59:47.457 --> 01:59:50.124
if just reach for them together.

01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:53.582
There is no adequate way

01:59:53.999 --> 01:59:57.665
in which we can express our gratitude
to the men themselves

01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.208
because they are no longer among us.

02:00:02.041 --> 02:00:05.208
However,
we can serve their memory,

02:00:05.416 --> 02:00:06.916
what they stood for...
