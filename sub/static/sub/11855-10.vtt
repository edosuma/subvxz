WEBVTT

00:12.125 --> 00:13.792
Let him go!

00:13.875 --> 00:17.250
(male #1)
'He didn't do anything.'

00:17.333 --> 00:19.208
Look, they are coming
down the stairs.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.041
Let him go!

00:23.125 --> 00:24.625
He didn't do anything!

00:24.709 --> 00:26.166
What you got, huh?

00:40.834 --> 00:42.917
We want real justice!

00:44.458 --> 00:46.959
Did you know there'd
be all these cameras?

00:47.041 --> 00:49.333
It's a big case.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.458
Oh, God, Greg.
You could be governor.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.375
You should have a better wife.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.625
Anna..

00:56.709 --> 00:58.125
...be strong.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.792
Greg. They want a statement.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.125
'Sir, you were gonna make
a statement please.'

01:10.208 --> 01:12.208
Good afternoon,
I'm ADA Harold Mott.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.083
Allow me to introduce
Greg Vizcaino.

01:14.166 --> 01:17.875
He's the lead prosecutor
on the Stacy Hall case.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.291
Two days ago Stacy Hall

01:19.375 --> 01:21.083
a young Yale graduate,
was on a morning jog

01:21.166 --> 01:24.500
when her life
was violently cut short.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.500
We grieve with her parents.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.000
The man you just saw led away
is Antonio Mendez

01:29.083 --> 01:32.166
who we will prove is
responsible
for this shocking crime.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.875
Now, Mr. Mott and I
will take any questions.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.208
That was six hours
well spent, I'll tell you
that.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.000
(Lilly)
'Ah, the training seminar.'

02:23.083 --> 02:25.709
Yeah, this guy has never
been on the line.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.083
Never worked a homicide.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.500
But he's an expert.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.333
(Nick)
'His answer for everything..'

02:30.417 --> 02:33.041
...auto-erotic asphyxiation.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.208
- You guys get dinner?
- There's pizza in the
fridge.

02:35.291 --> 02:36.709
Every job that ever

02:36.792 --> 02:40.417
happened in Philly,
was auto-erotic asphyxiation.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.542
Thanks for coming,
Mrs. Vizcaino.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.542
Greg wasn't perfect.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.834
But he was no thief.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.458
I hear you.

02:49.542 --> 02:50.583
Hi.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.583
- Hey, Gil.
- Rush. Gents.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.375
Who's, uh,
who's the
visitor?

02:56.458 --> 02:59.625
In from Connecticut.
Husband was killed in 2000.

02:59.709 --> 03:02.291
- The job never came in.
- Good-lookin' widow.

03:02.375 --> 03:04.250
Guy was from Connecticut
but died in Philly?

03:04.333 --> 03:06.792
Yeah, the case was a bag
of bones from the start.

03:06.875 --> 03:09.667
Actually, Valens, you might
want to take a look at it.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.917
Yeah? Why me?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.959
The guy was Puerto Rican.

03:13.041 --> 03:14.917
Greg Vizcaino.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.250
What was his story?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.208
Up and coming DA in New Haven.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.667
Turns up 150 miles away

03:19.750 --> 03:21.417
in North Philly,
stabbed to death.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.709
He prosecuting somebody
put a hit out on him?

03:23.792 --> 03:25.166
Ah, I looked into that

03:25.250 --> 03:26.959
and all the other thugs
he put away.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.417
The widow bring you
something new?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.792
Harold Mott.

03:30.875 --> 03:33.208
'He partnered
with Vizcaino on a murder
case'

03:33.291 --> 03:34.417
'at the time he died.'

03:34.500 --> 03:35.750
And?

03:35.834 --> 03:37.625
And now Mott's in a runoff
for state treasurer.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.625
- He's knocking the dead guy.
- How?

03:39.709 --> 03:42.583
Last week, a
reporter
lookin' for dirt

03:42.667 --> 03:44.000
found that 10K went missing

03:44.083 --> 03:46.875
from the DA's office,
back in 2000.

03:46.959 --> 03:48.792
So this Mott
get accused of takin'
it?

03:48.875 --> 03:50.750
Now, he points to Vizcaino.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.542
That's handy.
He can't defend himself.

03:52.625 --> 03:54.500
But the widow says
no way did he take it.

03:54.583 --> 03:58.250
But if he did, it could
be connected to his murder.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.917
So New Haven's the beginning,
North Philly's the end.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.959
What's the middle?

04:04.041 --> 04:06.125
Auto-erotic asphyxiation.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.709
Greg Vizcaino.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.333
35, grew up in
the New Haven
barrio.

04:45.417 --> 04:48.750
Went to Cornell,
then Yale Law
School.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.417
Success story.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.291
So what's he
doing
in North Philly?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.834
(John)
'No family or work connect.'

04:53.917 --> 04:55.667
He was supposed to be
in court the next day

04:55.750 --> 04:59.250
on this murder trial, but for
some reason he drives 150 miles

04:59.333 --> 05:01.000
to Philly, the night before.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.291
(John)
'Maybe the answer's tied
to the missin' money.'

05:03.375 --> 05:04.625
So why do we believe he took it?

05:04.709 --> 05:06.542
Just 'cause
some politician said so?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.917
We don't believe it yet,
Scotty.
We're gonna check it out.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.250
Maybe I'll look at this job.
Sinclair Thomas.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.375
You got any direction?

05:13.458 --> 05:14.542
I just like his name.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.792
If Vizcaino did need money, why?

05:16.875 --> 05:18.250
Gambling debt, blackmail?

05:18.333 --> 05:19.625
'It's gotta be
something personal.'

05:19.709 --> 05:21.333
Lill, you don't
stab someone 12 times

05:21.417 --> 05:24.250
just to rob them, then leave
the car and money behind.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.667
Hey, this Harold
Mott,
the guy who said

05:26.750 --> 05:29.500
Vizcaino swiped the cash,
took over as lead
prosecutor

05:29.583 --> 05:32.917
after Greg died, won the case,
made him a household name

05:33.000 --> 05:34.083
in New Haven.

05:34.166 --> 05:35.625
Now he's on the political track.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.166
It could have been
Vizcaino's future

05:37.250 --> 05:38.750
if someone hadn't shanked him.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.041
Well, maybe there's your motive.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.125
Let's start with Mott,
and see why he's saying

05:42.208 --> 05:43.375
Vizcaino stole the money.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.917
A road trip to New Haven?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.583
Job's gonna spring
for Howard Johnson's?

05:46.667 --> 05:49.417
Sure, but the boys
gotta bunk together.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.792
Junior guy gets the cot.

05:50.875 --> 05:51.834
No way.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.208
That's a known fact.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.917
We called him Golden Greg.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.959
Good looking, smart as a whip.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.125
A plus guy.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.792
Yet you told
the New Haven register

06:16.875 --> 06:19.709
that this great guy
stole that money.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.250
Look, I hate to
tarnish his name

06:21.333 --> 06:23.375
but when it
was suggested I took it

06:23.458 --> 06:24.792
I was pushed to the wall.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.667
Well, why would Greg do that,
take the 10 grand?

06:27.750 --> 06:29.583
I wouldn't speculate about that.

06:29.667 --> 06:30.792
Best guess.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.625
Greg wasn't himself
at the end.

06:34.709 --> 06:35.792
How's that?

06:35.875 --> 06:37.792
The Hall case
was the big leagues.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.792
Got a White jogger raped
and killed by a Latino kid.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.000
It was a slam dunk

06:42.083 --> 06:43.500
'till the kid
recanted his confession'

06:43.583 --> 06:45.083
and then, it got tough.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.291
And Greg couldn't take it?

06:46.375 --> 06:47.959
It was his first time
as lead prosecutor

06:48.041 --> 06:51.792
and he-he started out great
but he lost focus.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.333
Yeah? How?

06:54.417 --> 06:55.959
At work he was all over the map

06:56.041 --> 06:59.500
pulling vice reports,
making weird phone calls.

06:59.583 --> 07:03.291
He-he just seemed distracted by
something other than the case.

07:03.375 --> 07:04.667
You ask him about it?

07:04.750 --> 07:05.834
No, he was first chair.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.917
I wasn't supposed
to question him.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.208
He ever mention Philadelphia?

07:11.709 --> 07:15.166
No. But he would disappear
for hours at a time.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.333
Maybe he went there.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.834
So in the middle
of your case, he'd go AWOL

07:19.917 --> 07:21.875
'and you had no idea where to?'

07:24.166 --> 07:26.291
I know where he went one time.

07:26.375 --> 07:29.417
If this gets out, it-it's
a Pandora's box though.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.792
It won't get out.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.625
The day before he disappeared

07:35.709 --> 07:37.959
Greg did something that any law
student would tell you

07:38.041 --> 07:40.208
is incredibly unethical.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.375
I just heard from the
prison ward at county.

07:45.458 --> 07:46.625
Yeah.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.792
They said you
visited
Antonio last night.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.041
I said that had to be wrong.

07:50.125 --> 07:52.208
Harold, I know what I'm doing.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.875
You visited the defendant
without his lawyer
present?

07:54.959 --> 07:56.875
You know what this could
do
to our case, right?

07:56.959 --> 07:58.041
You know you could be disbarred.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.542
It's under control. It's fine.

07:59.625 --> 08:00.834
Fine? Greg, what is goin' on?

08:00.917 --> 08:03.041
- Nothing.
- Where you going?

08:03.125 --> 08:04.083
I got to be someplace.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.625
We're in the middle of a trial!

08:05.709 --> 08:08.375
And I'm first chair, telling
you, I gotta be someplace.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.542
I know what I'm doing.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.333
I don't care what Greg said.

08:21.417 --> 08:26.208
He was drowning.
And the next day, he was dead.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.709
Antonio was the guy
you were prosecuting?

08:28.792 --> 08:30.792
Serving a life sentence now.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.291
Real tough luck kid.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.667
Tried suicide in jail
before the trial.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.709
So you never told anyone
about Greg's visit?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.417
No. It would have led
to a mistrial.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.333
And you wouldn't
make the front page.

08:41.417 --> 08:44.667
Oh.. Antonio confessed
to rape and murder.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.208
But recanted.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.291
Public defender gets involved,
it's always the strategy.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.500
Bottom line, I wasn't gonna
let that kid walk

08:51.583 --> 08:54.500
because Greg was crackin' up.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.583
What do you think
happened to Greg?

08:58.166 --> 09:02.458
He was a striver,
and on his way but..

09:02.542 --> 09:04.917
...he wasn't ready for the job

09:05.000 --> 09:09.959
and being proud, he wouldn't ask
for help, so he self-destructed.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.208
Whole thing
was an American tragedy.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.792
Detectives Jeffries
and Vera, Antonio.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.834
Philly cops, huh?

09:26.917 --> 09:28.208
I don't like talkin' to police.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.959
We gotta ask you about
Greg Vizcaino.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.000
The lawyer that died
in the middle of your trial.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.417
Wasn't me. I was locked up.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.375
'Well, we know he came
to see you before he died.'

09:37.458 --> 09:38.625
You tell anybody about that?

09:38.709 --> 09:39.625
What for?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.250
He give you money to stay quiet?

09:41.333 --> 09:42.709
Try and pay you to plead guilty?

09:42.792 --> 09:45.834
I am guilty. Haven't you heard?

09:45.917 --> 09:48.333
What did Greg want
with you that
night?

09:48.417 --> 09:52.000
Make sure the case
was gonna go his way.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.083
I tried to hang myself.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.667
He thought I wouldn't
make it to trial.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.208
Blow his chance to be a hero.

09:58.291 --> 09:59.500
That what he told you?

09:59.583 --> 10:01.500
"You got to stay alive, Antonio.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.000
"My ass is on the line here."

10:04.083 --> 10:06.083
Except he's the one
who don't make it.

10:06.166 --> 10:08.917
Didn't make a difference.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Cops had me on video
sayin' I did it.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.041
Got sent here for life.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.417
Antonio went
in 10
minutes.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.709
I'm almost embarrassed
to show you how easy it was.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.333
Almost feel sorry
for him, don't you?

10:30.417 --> 10:32.500
We got a saying here,
"If they weren't dumb

10:32.583 --> 10:34.375
"we wouldn't catch 'em."

10:34.458 --> 10:35.959
Applies in Philadelphia too.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.375
Here goes.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.417
I seen her running in the park.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.667
(male #2)
'Did you chase her?'

10:42.750 --> 10:46.500
No. Just waited for her to pass.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.208
Then what did you do?

10:48.291 --> 10:49.875
Jumped her.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.125
He took it all back
once he got a lawyer.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.959
- You testify at trial?
- Sure.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.542
I was the lead detective.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.208
Hey, guys.
This is Sergeant Sal
Martin.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.709
'He worked the Stacy Hall job.'

10:59.792 --> 11:01.375
- Hi.
- Welcome to New Haven.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.500
'Lilly Rush, Scotty Valens.'

11:03.583 --> 11:05.291
Hey.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.542
Boricua.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.917
<i>Por parte de mi madre.</i>
<i>Mi padre, qua.</i>

11:10.000 --> 11:11.250
According to Harold Mott

11:11.333 --> 11:13.583
'Greg was unraveling
the last few weeks of his
life.'

11:13.667 --> 11:15.250
Yeah, how'd he seem to you?

11:16.750 --> 11:17.792
Alright.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.375
You don't say that
like you mean it.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.709
Well, stressed maybe.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.959
Bright young star
of the DA's office.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.166
People talkin'
about
your political
future.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.667
- It's a lot of pressure.
- Right.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.417
Any reason he'd need 10K?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.750
We could all use 10K.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.583
But Greg in particular?

11:38.333 --> 11:40.125
He was a good kid..

11:40.208 --> 11:42.375
...but even good kids
growing up in bad neighborhoods

11:42.458 --> 11:43.583
pick up bad habits.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.709
What kind of bad habits?

11:49.917 --> 11:51.125
Crap.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.000
Greg was a good guy.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.500
That's what Harold Mott said.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.291
Everyone has a dark side.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.208
Greg's was...pretty dark.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.750
(Sal)
'Hey.'

12:07.834 --> 12:09.000
That's the last
I wanna see you.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.458
Get out of here.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.250
Way behind on payments, Greg.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.458
I know, I know.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.458
This is all I have right now.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.208
When's the next
installment coming?

12:27.291 --> 12:29.208
This guy bothering you,
counselor?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.125
No, detective. It's alright.

12:39.583 --> 12:40.458
I-I was just..

12:40.542 --> 12:42.041
Walkin' the murder scene again?

12:43.583 --> 12:45.834
Stacy Hall was killed
at the park down the street.

12:45.917 --> 12:51.000
You were just checking out
the area for yourself. Right?

12:51.083 --> 12:52.667
Right.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.166
Just walkin' the scene.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.166
Don't make it so obvious, Greg.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.417
I seen him a lot with this
dealer, a guy named Kiki.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.041
It was known on the street
that he had a habit.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.125
Kind of an open secret?

13:21.208 --> 13:23.542
Look, I don't want to speak
ill of the dead

13:23.625 --> 13:26.792
but a coke habit,
takes a lot of cash.

13:26.875 --> 13:30.041
So despite what the widow says
maybe Greg was a thief.

13:30.125 --> 13:31.917
And an addict.

13:33.041 --> 13:35.500
Yeah. Maybe.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.417
So Golden Greg
is losing it at work

13:43.500 --> 13:46.291
blowin' his murder case
and feedin' a coke habit.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.917
Which still doesn't tell us
how he winds up in Philly.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.291
I just hope I don't come down

13:50.375 --> 13:52.500
with a cold sleepin'
in Siberia all night.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.875
Man, you need the windows
open for fresh air.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.291
So you told me.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.125
You guys work out
the cot problem?

13:59.208 --> 14:01.000
'Yeah, we drew straws.'

14:01.083 --> 14:02.291
Vera lost.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.458
And leaves all miffed,
doesn't come back.

14:04.542 --> 14:05.875
You worried?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.166
Ah, he went out to check out

14:07.250 --> 14:09.166
the hot spots of New Haven
with Martin.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.625
All I want to know is,
uh, who's Lina?

14:12.709 --> 14:13.750
Hey.

14:13.834 --> 14:14.750
"Listen now, Lina.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.458
"Just sing it one more time."

14:17.542 --> 14:20.000
- Stop that.
- You talk in your sleep,
man.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.750
- Mmm.
- Ah, look who's here.

14:25.834 --> 14:26.750
Rough night, Vera?

14:26.834 --> 14:29.083
This city blows. Nothin' to do.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.500
Can I get some coffee over here?

14:30.583 --> 14:32.250
Did Martin tell you
where to find that
dealer?

14:32.333 --> 14:34.333
Uh, Eden Park.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.750
Look for some crazy guy
with dreadlocks.

14:38.125 --> 14:39.083
Ready?

14:39.166 --> 14:42.333
Drop me off at New Haven PD?

14:42.417 --> 14:43.792
I'll catch up.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.041
He's payin'.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.542
Smell that, smell that.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.667
Kiki Solano?

14:58.750 --> 15:00.500
Uh-oh, clear the street.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.959
New Haven's finest
on the beat.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.625
What's up, Five-O?

15:04.709 --> 15:06.333
Five-bro?

15:06.417 --> 15:09.792
Yeah. Detectives Jeffries
and Valens from Philly.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.917
We're here about Greg Vizcaino.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.458
DA who got
killed
four years ago.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.000
You ain't gotta tell me
who Greg V is.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.750
Went to grade school together.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.750
The day he died, whoo,
hysteria in the area.

15:21.834 --> 15:24.291
'Whole barrio dressed in black.'

15:24.375 --> 15:26.750
We know you were selling
him blow before he died.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.333
This all I sell.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.834
Strictly botanical,
always organic.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.417
Well, we ain't narcs.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.166
We know Greg owed you money.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.166
You kill him over that?

15:35.250 --> 15:37.083
Greg was my brother.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.375
<i>'Hermanos.'</i>

15:38.458 --> 15:40.667
I wasn't worried
about his debts.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.500
I was worried about his soul.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.166
Yeah? Why?

15:44.250 --> 15:46.166
They loved him at the DA's.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.834
'Cause he was light,
bright, and damn near
white.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.625
I tried to get him to see
that they was just usin' him.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.542
'Why you got to parade that
kid in front of the cameras,
G?'

16:03.625 --> 16:04.709
'To show he's Puerto Rican?'

16:04.792 --> 16:06.709
I'll parade any
murderer
in the street.

16:06.792 --> 16:09.750
And put that lady's
rich White parents on display?

16:09.834 --> 16:13.208
It's facts, Kiki.
She's White, he's
not.

16:13.291 --> 16:14.542
That kid didn't do it.

16:14.625 --> 16:15.792
Then why'd he confess?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.709
And why'd he recant?

16:17.792 --> 16:19.959
He's from the barrio like us.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.667
Got to listen to the word.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.041
What word is that?

16:23.125 --> 16:26.709
The streets have eyes,
and they tell no lies.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.959
The streets know
something about this murder.

16:29.041 --> 16:31.875
Am I supposed to call
the streets as witnesses?

16:34.291 --> 16:36.834
I got a deal for you, G.

16:36.917 --> 16:39.125
Check out what
the streets got to say..

16:39.208 --> 16:41.709
...and I won't sell
to her no more.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.250
(Valens)
'Who would you stop sellin'
to?'

16:46.333 --> 16:47.917
Anna.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.208
Greg's wife.

16:51.041 --> 16:54.083
She hooked on the incense?

16:54.166 --> 16:57.000
You said you
wasn't narcotics, playa.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.208
So his wife was the one
with the coke problem?

16:59.291 --> 17:02.250
Gone on the wagon.
Rode it hard but..

17:02.333 --> 17:03.959
...the wheels come off
every now and then

17:04.041 --> 17:05.250
when things got bumpy.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.959
Greg take you up on the deal?

17:07.041 --> 17:08.792
I held up my end.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.041
Don't know about G.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.959
What was the word
from the streets?

17:12.041 --> 17:14.875
That kid didn't kill the lady.

17:17.417 --> 17:20.917
It was the Kennedy brothers.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.083
Like John and Bobby, you mean?

17:24.250 --> 17:26.834
That's one good tip, Kiki.
Thanks.

17:34.208 --> 17:36.959
It was a leftover thing
from college.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.458
Used it to get me through
stressful times.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.625
Way your dealer tells it,
sounds more like a meal

17:41.709 --> 17:42.959
than a leftover.

17:43.041 --> 17:47.208
Yeah, I was out of control.
I admit that.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.959
So you're in debt to Kiki.
Greg needed money to pay
it.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.125
My husband would never steal.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.458
That missing money had nothing
to do with him.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.083
Got to look at the facts, Anna.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.291
I told Gil Sherman.

17:59.375 --> 18:00.458
He was no thief.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.583
Sometimes when you love someone

18:02.667 --> 18:04.417
you only see them
like you want to.

18:08.250 --> 18:12.083
But I changed my views
over the last four years.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.166
I was so ashamed then.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.417
Of what?

18:18.291 --> 18:20.750
(man on TV)
'...completed its recount
as Vice President Gore'

18:20.834 --> 18:23.750
'has only picked up 54 votes
on Governor Bush.'

18:23.834 --> 18:25.166
Did you get my message?

18:25.250 --> 18:26.250
I was working.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.083
I don't believe you.

18:29.166 --> 18:32.041
You're doin' that crap, Anna, in
the house, with the girls here.

18:32.125 --> 18:34.333
- Where do you go?
- I'm working.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.709
Who calls here and hangs up
every time I say, hello?

18:36.792 --> 18:38.500
Do you hear how paranoid
you sound?

18:38.583 --> 18:40.750
I brought the car
in for service and they asked

18:40.834 --> 18:43.917
why there was so much
mileage built up on it.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.166
Where do you go?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.083
I cannot talk to you
when you are wired.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.083
Tell me!

18:57.583 --> 18:59.208
Kiss me.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.083
You won't do it, will you?

19:08.166 --> 19:10.375
Not when you're like this.

19:10.458 --> 19:13.500
How are you gonna be governor
with your secrets?

19:18.542 --> 19:21.208
What do you think he was hiding?

19:21.291 --> 19:23.375
I know what he was hiding.

19:23.458 --> 19:24.542
I'm not proud of it

19:24.625 --> 19:26.500
but I looked through
his briefcase once

19:26.583 --> 19:28.875
and found some newspaper ads.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.250
For escorts.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.667
Call girls?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.583
Boys.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.375
He had some names circled.

19:37.458 --> 19:40.750
His favorite seemed
to be one named Ramone.

19:40.834 --> 19:41.792
You confront him?

19:41.875 --> 19:43.041
Nah, I was too shocked.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.500
Ashamed.

19:46.333 --> 19:49.333
But if people find out now,
so be it.

19:49.417 --> 19:50.667
If my husband was gay..

19:52.500 --> 19:53.875
...well, that isn't a crime.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.166
Yeah, but stealin' is.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.959
That's why
I want his name cleared.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.417
Do you remember what
newspapers
they were, Anna?

19:59.500 --> 20:02.041
They were those free rags
you find on the street.

20:02.125 --> 20:07.333
"Action," "Gay Times,"
"City Paper."

20:07.417 --> 20:09.709
You sure about that?
"The City Paper?"

20:09.792 --> 20:11.875
- Hmm.
- That's from Philadelphia.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.625
Hmm.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.083
Maybe we finally got
our Philly connect.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.333
So he wasn't a coke head?

20:22.417 --> 20:23.458
That was his wife.

20:23.542 --> 20:25.417
He was busy prowlin' for boys.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.750
But why in Philly?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.917
Too much to loose
if he's found out in New
Haven.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.041
Hartford's closer, Scotty,
New York.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.333
Well, maybe he started there

20:32.417 --> 20:35.333
and something or someone
brought him here.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.625
Maybe Ramone.

20:36.709 --> 20:38.000
Remember Harold Mott said

20:38.083 --> 20:40.417
Greg was looking at vice
reports
instead of workin'.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.375
Yeah?

20:41.458 --> 20:42.375
Maybe with all this stress

20:42.458 --> 20:43.792
he went lookin' for comfort.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.834
Arrest reports could tell him
where to find it by name.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.166
Easy targets too.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.834
More willing to play
if they've been arrested
before.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.667
(John)
'Go see Harold Mott again.'

20:51.750 --> 20:53.083
Get some details on the reports.

20:53.166 --> 20:54.625
Don't count on him
being too helpful.

20:54.709 --> 20:55.834
No? Why?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.625
'I've been followin'
that missin' money.'

20:57.709 --> 20:59.000
Only Greg and Harold had access.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.375
Yeah?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.166
Guess who lost a bundle
on tech stocks in early 2000?

21:02.250 --> 21:03.542
Harold.

21:03.625 --> 21:06.166
And he was in hot water until
suddenly nine grand appears

21:06.250 --> 21:07.500
in his wife's stock account

21:07.583 --> 21:08.917
a week after the
10K goes missin'.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.083
You send it to New Haven PD?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.709
So don't be surprised
if Harold pulls the welcome
mat.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.083
I knew if I timed it
just right..

21:23.166 --> 21:25.542
You can't stay
away from the place?

21:25.625 --> 21:27.291
I'm dropping gloves off
for Lill.

21:27.375 --> 21:30.041
The temperature went down
20 degrees over the day.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.375
Yeah, well,
she's still up there.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.709
I'm just gonna
leave
them at the desk.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.959
She doesn't like to see me here.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.959
Too friendly.

21:38.041 --> 21:40.375
Well, there are worse things.

21:40.458 --> 21:44.125
You know, you dress way
better
than the average cop.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.166
That ain't sayin' a lot.

21:46.250 --> 21:49.542
No, I guess not.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.834
Your girlfriend pick
out
your clothes?

21:51.917 --> 21:53.750
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.166
I mean, I used to but
she's in the hospital right
now.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.542
- Sorry.
- She's okay.

21:58.625 --> 22:00.083
- She's getting out.
- That's good.

22:00.166 --> 22:03.709
Uh, even though, we're not
really together anymore..

22:07.375 --> 22:11.250
I work at McGinty's
Tavern,
if you ever want a free
beer.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.500
Yeah, okay.

22:16.542 --> 22:17.750
See ya.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.083
Oh, great.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.959
- What do you want?
- Bad day?

22:36.041 --> 22:37.583
The cops and press
are all over me

22:37.667 --> 22:39.166
because of you sticking
your nose in this.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.625
That's the price of being
a public figure, Harold.

22:41.709 --> 22:43.709
We need to know more
about Greg Vizcaino.

22:43.792 --> 22:45.917
I told you what I know.
He cracked.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.417
The price of being put in
the game before you're ready.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.917
Hmm. But you were ready.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.375
I tried to help him.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.041
But you can't expect
the water boy

22:53.125 --> 22:54.750
to play quarterback.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.250
The vice
reports
he was pulling

22:56.333 --> 22:59.250
any reason to think he was
using
them for personal reasons?

23:01.500 --> 23:03.125
What the hell. Yeah.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.834
Golden Greg, liked his boys
young and cheap.

23:08.291 --> 23:09.458
Go on.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.125
Ramon..

23:27.542 --> 23:29.792
Ramon, from Juniper Street.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.083
Another Puerto Rican packer?

23:31.166 --> 23:33.375
- Screw you.
- No, screw you.

23:33.458 --> 23:35.125
We've got the trial
of the year to prep for

23:35.208 --> 23:36.792
and you're
chasing
male hookers.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.000
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm doing

23:38.083 --> 23:39.166
'cause I'm a promiscuous Latin.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.667
And a lightweight token.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.542
You barely made it through
Acme Law School.

23:42.625 --> 23:43.750
You calling me a lightweight?

23:43.834 --> 23:45.500
Spare me the
barrio
superiority.

23:45.583 --> 23:47.000
So you grew up
poor and
hungry.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.166
Boo freakin' hoo.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.875
It doesn't entitle
you to my job.

23:49.959 --> 23:52.500
No, my being smarter than
you entitles me to my job.

23:52.583 --> 23:56.041
- You're delusional.
- And you're a cracker
flunky.

23:57.750 --> 23:58.792
Pfft.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.166
He was a disgrace
to his heritage.

24:02.250 --> 24:03.834
Well, you'd know
all about that, huh?

24:03.917 --> 24:06.291
You wanted the truth.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
While I was busting my
ass
on the Hall trial

24:08.667 --> 24:12.208
he was in here using vice
reports to chase boyfriends.

24:12.291 --> 24:13.959
(Lilly)
'And who's Ramon?'

24:14.041 --> 24:16.250
A name he got off a report.

24:16.333 --> 24:19.041
Probably some barrio trick.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.041
Is there a Juniper Street
in New Haven?

24:22.125 --> 24:24.542
Not that I know of.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.000
We done here?

24:26.083 --> 24:28.667
Yeah. We're done.

24:32.792 --> 24:34.500
You know a
hustler
named Ramon

24:34.583 --> 24:36.125
Puerto Rican,
probably in his
20s?

24:36.208 --> 24:37.834
What do I look like, 411?

24:37.917 --> 24:38.875
Came from Connecticut.

24:38.959 --> 24:40.792
Showed up about
four years ago.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.333
Four years ago
I'm in high school.

24:43.417 --> 24:44.667
So that's a no?

24:44.750 --> 24:47.208
Try the boy trade theater
on 13th Street.

24:47.291 --> 24:48.709
Will do.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.041
Any luck?

24:56.125 --> 24:57.458
Squat.

24:57.542 --> 24:59.333
We covered all of
Juniper Street.

24:59.417 --> 25:00.875
I wish we had
a sketch on this guy.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.208
We're chasing a ghost.

25:02.291 --> 25:03.959
Ah, let's try the theater.

25:05.583 --> 25:07.250
You ever notice
how we're the ones

25:07.333 --> 25:09.041
always chasing the Marys.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.583
You know a trick named Ramon?

25:22.667 --> 25:24.208
Pretty boy wearing the cap.

25:29.667 --> 25:32.375
- Ramon?
- Nah.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.792
You're not Ramon
formally of New Haven?

25:42.500 --> 25:45.417
Look, I didn't do nothing.
I was just talking to that
guy.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.458
We want to know
about Greg Vizcaino.

25:47.542 --> 25:49.709
- I don't know no Greg.
- He was a DA in New Haven.

25:49.792 --> 25:51.792
- You two hung out.
- He was your boyfriend.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.959
Maybe you had a lover's
quarrel
and you killed him.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.750
Whoa, I didn't kill nobody.

25:55.834 --> 25:57.875
He had it bad for you.
He even left his wife and
kids.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.125
Chased you down here
from New Haven.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.375
Wouldn't take
no for an answer.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.959
(John)
'Killed him to
get rid of him?'

26:02.041 --> 26:04.291
Look, that's all crazy.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.792
I never knew him in New Haven.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.375
Then why did he come down here
looking for you?

26:11.500 --> 26:14.542
Come on, boyfriend,
why was he looking for you?

26:16.709 --> 26:18.500
Because of what I saw.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.208
You want a date?

26:40.291 --> 26:42.667
No. I want to talk.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.375
You paying for it,
you can have anything.

26:57.291 --> 26:58.250
'I want to hear
about that lady'

26:58.333 --> 27:00.458
in the park
back
in New Haven.

27:01.875 --> 27:03.959
- I don't know nothing.
- Ramon, you do.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.667
You saw.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.667
How do you know my name?

27:10.500 --> 27:12.208
You ain't gay, are you?

27:12.291 --> 27:13.709
No.

27:13.792 --> 27:17.208
So you never had your ass
kicked by bastards.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.375
No.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.208
You think you're just
gonna die in the street

27:20.291 --> 27:21.542
and no one's gonna care?

27:23.792 --> 27:25.875
I don't need them brothers
mad at me.

27:25.959 --> 27:26.875
What brothers?

27:26.959 --> 27:28.417
Look, just forget it.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.000
I didn't see nothing
low at all.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.583
And I ain't going back
to Connecticut.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.291
'There's a kid sitting
in prison'

27:33.375 --> 27:35.709
for killing that woman.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.583
He just tried to hang
himself.
He's 17.

27:38.667 --> 27:40.125
'If you saw someone
else hurt her'

27:40.208 --> 27:43.250
you got to say so
right now, Ramon.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.583
Two White guys.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.917
It was dark,
how could you tell?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.875
Everybody knows them.

27:56.959 --> 27:59.458
They come to the park
to buy drugs.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.709
So who are these White guys?

28:06.792 --> 28:08.583
College kids.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.333
Like to beat up on
innos like me.

28:10.417 --> 28:12.917
And all the queens knew
to watch out for the Kennedys.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.333
- Kennedys?
- Two brothers, I think.

28:16.417 --> 28:19.083
They used to drive
an old green Volvo.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.834
Told the cops what you saw?

28:20.917 --> 28:22.083
I told Martin.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.917
Some Puerto Rican cop
on the case.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.291
Yeah, we know Martin.

28:26.375 --> 28:29.125
You told him you saw
the Kennedys attack the woman?

28:31.625 --> 28:34.667
But he said no,
that I didn't see nothing

28:34.750 --> 28:37.625
and that I better
get out of New Haven.

28:37.709 --> 28:41.291
So, Martin's the reason
you booked it to Philly?

28:41.375 --> 28:43.500
He told me if he ever
saw me back there

28:43.583 --> 28:46.000
that it would be
the last time.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.625
So Martin was a dirty cop.

28:56.709 --> 28:58.375
Why else would he ignore
the tip from Ramon?

28:58.458 --> 29:00.041
I didn't believe him.
The kid's a hustler.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.458
Or because he already got
his confession from Antonio

29:02.542 --> 29:04.208
didn't want to mess
with a solid case.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.125
Let's go a step further.

29:06.208 --> 29:08.625
- We think Martin killed
Greg?
- Phew.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.792
If he knew Greg found Ramon,
it gives him a motive.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.458
(John)
Alright, go back to Antonio.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.250
See how Martin got
the confession from him.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.542
Boss, we saw the tape.

29:16.625 --> 29:18.333
Just see where
it takes us, Nick.

29:18.417 --> 29:20.834
Try to place Martin
in Philly that night?

29:20.917 --> 29:23.375
The second time we've heard
about these Kennedy brothers.

29:23.458 --> 29:25.000
Now, who can help us find them?

29:29.208 --> 29:31.542
Don't seem so
crazy now, does
it?

29:31.625 --> 29:33.834
We looked in enrollment
for every college in New
Haven.

29:33.917 --> 29:36.750
There were no Kennedy brothers
listed in 2000.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.667
Forget literal.
Think
subliminal.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.166
That ain't their real names.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.959
Just what we called
them sports around here.

29:43.041 --> 29:45.500
Didn't think about
telling
New Haven PD about them?

29:45.583 --> 29:47.000
Player, please.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.792
They gonna believe
the dreadlock guy

29:48.875 --> 29:50.166
or the college boys?

29:50.250 --> 29:53.250
Plus, talking to cops
is bad for business.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.917
Well, Greg believed you, Kiki.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.375
And he found the witness
who saw them attack the jogger.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.792
- For real?
- Yeah.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.583
- Local hustler.
- That why G was in Philly?

30:00.667 --> 30:03.333
He died trying to
prove
Antonio was innocent.

30:06.542 --> 30:08.542
Guess we both
kept our promise.

30:08.625 --> 30:11.000
We gotta find
those
brothers.

30:11.083 --> 30:14.000
Can you help me?

30:14.083 --> 30:17.375
They come around
sometimes on Thursdays..

30:17.458 --> 30:19.333
...getting ready
for the weekend.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.083
[buzzing]
'Where are the other guys at?'

30:22.166 --> 30:23.792
Back in Philly.

30:23.875 --> 30:25.709
We need you to tell us
about Detective Martin.

30:25.792 --> 30:28.750
- Nothing to tell.
- We know he's dirty.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.709
Antonio, he can't hurt you now.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.250
No matter what
he threatened you with.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.834
Why am I gonna believe you?

30:36.917 --> 30:38.291
Who else you got?

30:38.375 --> 30:41.208
- We'll protect you.
- Don't need no protection
now.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.291
But my moms.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.542
No one's touching your moms.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.750
Where you at four years ago?

30:51.834 --> 30:53.333
We're here now.

30:54.959 --> 30:56.709
So how did
Martin find
you?

30:56.792 --> 31:01.083
I walked by the dead lady
when the cops got there.

31:02.834 --> 31:05.291
Martin seen me.
Asked me what I knew.

31:05.375 --> 31:07.041
- What'd you tell him?
- The truth.

31:07.125 --> 31:10.291
I didn't see nothing.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.667
My mama sent me to buy eggs.

31:12.750 --> 31:13.709
And then?

31:13.792 --> 31:15.291
He let me go.

31:15.375 --> 31:19.417
But later...he
comes
to my house.

31:20.709 --> 31:23.709
Tells my mom he got to
take me down to the
station.

31:24.417 --> 31:25.500
Did he?

31:26.917 --> 31:28.375
Took me to an old building.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.667
This was a meat-packing
plant when I was a kid.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.917
We going to the station?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.792
My buddies and I used to
play
baseball right out there.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.250
It's cold in here.

31:42.458 --> 31:45.083
What happened
in the park, Antonio?

31:45.166 --> 31:46.375
I was going to the store.

31:46.458 --> 31:47.959
Yeah, yeah.

31:48.041 --> 31:49.583
Going to the store
to buy eggs.

31:49.667 --> 31:50.750
'At 6:00 in the morning?'

31:50.834 --> 31:53.000
- Come on.
- My mama sent me.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.917
Your sneaker tracks were all
over the crime scene, Antonio.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.375
I play ball in the park
sometimes.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.417
What happened when you saw
that lady running?

32:01.500 --> 32:04.166
- I didn't see her.
- Sure you did.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.000
You were behind
the tree

32:06.083 --> 32:07.166
and you saw
her running
by.

32:07.250 --> 32:09.458
I didn't see that lady running.

32:16.917 --> 32:19.709
- Why you hitting me?
- You're lying to me,
Antonio.

32:19.792 --> 32:22.000
- I ain't lying, sir.
- Good.

32:22.083 --> 32:23.875
Now, tell me how you killed
that lady.

32:25.083 --> 32:26.250
I ain't never seen her.

32:32.750 --> 32:36.333
How am I supposed to say
I did something I didn't..

32:36.417 --> 32:38.625
Listen good.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.166
Please.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.625
We ain't leaving
here
until you tell me

32:45.709 --> 32:47.709
how you murdered that woman.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.500
I didn't kill nobody.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.709
'Ain't nobody can help you.'

32:59.792 --> 33:02.917
'Cause you tell anybody about
this, I'm gonna bring your
moms

33:03.000 --> 33:04.750
down here and have
a talk with her.

33:04.834 --> 33:06.834
Understand?

33:06.917 --> 33:09.250
And I know she
ain't strong like you.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.458
Even if you are a punk.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.875
Knew how to do it.

33:17.959 --> 33:19.709
So I got the wind
knocked out of me

33:19.792 --> 33:22.333
over and over.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.750
How long were you there?

33:24.834 --> 33:27.041
Till I say
what he wanted me to say.

33:28.458 --> 33:31.750
Then, he'd take me
to the station

33:31.834 --> 33:34.250
so I could say
it
to the video.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.291
We're gonna be back.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.625
Look at me.

33:49.583 --> 33:51.792
We're gonna be back.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.583
At first,
I just talk.

33:57.667 --> 33:58.750
I mean, I'm a good talker.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.792
I'll talk you
into a statue.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.000
Ooh, we got Dr.
Phil
over here.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.959
Start with the C material.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.417
You put the needle in here

34:07.500 --> 34:10.000
and you're
dead in eight minutes.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.959
It works on
the real dumb ones.

34:12.041 --> 34:13.792
And what's your
B material?

34:13.875 --> 34:15.959
Oh, bonding.

34:16.041 --> 34:18.625
You know, you got
a sick kid? Me too.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.625
I feel your pain.

34:20.709 --> 34:22.583
I save that line
for the ladies.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.583
When all else fails,
we go for a drive.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.417
- Mm-hmm.
- Down to the old shipyards.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.458
We ain't got
no shipyards
here.

34:29.542 --> 34:31.959
But we got a lot
of old buildings.

34:32.041 --> 34:34.959
I take a mug down there,
just the two of us.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.625
'He's squawking in the back
seat
about a lawyer.'

34:37.709 --> 34:38.917
I don't say a word.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.834
'We get down
to the shipyards'

34:40.917 --> 34:43.250
I pull a trash bag
full of oranges

34:43.333 --> 34:46.792
and I hit him hard
in the stomach.

34:46.875 --> 34:49.208
[chuckles]
That's good.

34:49.291 --> 34:52.417
Don't even leave bruises.

34:53.709 --> 34:58.125
- Oh. Oh, so these buildings?
- Hmm.

34:58.208 --> 35:00.667
Big, empty, quiet.

35:02.375 --> 35:03.667
Is that where you took Antonio?

35:05.166 --> 35:07.291
Come on.
I saw that tape.

35:07.375 --> 35:10.500
I know what the fear
of God looks like.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.834
20 minutes
with that
kid.

35:11.917 --> 35:13.542
Oh! That's all?

35:13.625 --> 35:16.041
It's almost too
easy,
like I said.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.333
'That kid was gonna be
in the system soon enough.'

35:18.417 --> 35:20.542
I...just helped him along.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.875
That let you sleep
at night, Martin?

35:23.959 --> 35:25.291
What's going on?

35:29.333 --> 35:30.917
You're screwed.

35:33.917 --> 35:35.417
Your badge don't mean
nothing here.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.709
The lieutenant's right there.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.000
You played a fellow cop!

35:45.083 --> 35:46.208
You coerced that kid.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.667
You crossed
to the other side, Martin.

35:48.750 --> 35:51.208
He was there at the scene
right after the murder.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.417
So you thought he was guilty
when you tuned him up.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.083
Oh, when Ramon told you
he saw the Kennedy's do it--

35:56.166 --> 35:57.667
Ramon is a two-bit hustler.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.542
You knew you were wrong,
but it was too late.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.834
'But you had
to protect your case'

36:00.917 --> 36:02.291
because you were heading
for sergeant?

36:02.375 --> 36:05.542
We got phone and E-ZPass
records
for that night.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.333
Greg called you,
left you a voicemail.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.041
It was
about
the trial.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.667
An hour later
you were on the turnpike

36:10.750 --> 36:11.834
heading for Philly.

36:11.917 --> 36:13.375
That kid Antonio
was going nowhere.

36:13.458 --> 36:16.083
Hey, that kid
was poor and slow.

36:16.792 --> 36:18.291
Now he's destroyed.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.750
You're gonna turn
<i>hermano?</i>

36:24.834 --> 36:27.375
You ain't my kind.

36:27.458 --> 36:29.458
And you ain't my brother.

36:31.083 --> 36:32.917
Talk about Philadelphia.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.458
Finding Greg.

36:44.417 --> 36:45.458
He's..

36:46.667 --> 36:49.417
He said we arrested
the wrong guy.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.250
Come to
Philly,
help me find

36:52.333 --> 36:54.291
the witness
who saw
everything.

37:13.041 --> 37:14.083
Greg.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.291
You got my message.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.500
Yeah.

37:19.583 --> 37:21.333
But you already
knew
about Ramon.

37:23.417 --> 37:24.792
He's not a credible witness.

37:24.875 --> 37:25.917
'No?'

37:26.000 --> 37:27.458
Then why'd you drive him
out of town?

37:27.542 --> 37:28.875
Greg, be reasonable.

37:28.959 --> 37:31.041
An innocent
kid
is sitting in
jail.

37:31.125 --> 37:32.458
This is amazing.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.000
I give you the biggest case
of your career

37:35.083 --> 37:36.041
and this is my thanks?

37:36.125 --> 37:37.166
You gave me a mess.

37:37.250 --> 37:38.500
This case is bogus.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.834
You think those White kids
are gonna confess?

37:40.917 --> 37:42.375
You put this case away.

37:42.458 --> 37:43.834
'We can both win here.'

37:43.917 --> 37:45.166
Now, while that kid loses?

37:45.250 --> 37:46.542
He ain't got no future.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.625
We can change that.
We'll set this right.

37:48.709 --> 37:50.208
It's too late
for that.

37:50.291 --> 37:51.834
Look, I got my phone.

37:51.917 --> 37:53.000
Let's call the
judge
right now.

37:53.083 --> 37:56.583
And screw our careers?

37:56.667 --> 37:59.959
What's more
important,
his life or our
careers?

38:02.917 --> 38:05.542
- It's cold-blooded, Martin.
- Think it through, Greg.

38:05.625 --> 38:07.917
You're the great political
hope of New Haven.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.875
People talking about you
being governor.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.834
You gonna chuck that
for this dimwit?

38:13.917 --> 38:16.417
Yeah. Yes, I am.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.542
Not with me in tow.

38:18.625 --> 38:21.041
No? What are you gonna do?

38:21.959 --> 38:24.041
Take me to an empty building?

38:25.792 --> 38:27.417
You're a disgrace, Martin.
