00:32.119 --> 00:35.440
You want a light?
Mm-hmm.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.040
How are things
down the other end?

01:02.260 --> 01:05.930
This is like living in Pittsburgh.
If you can call that living.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.420
A couple of people
have made that observation,

01:11.510 --> 01:13.330
that it's like working
in a foreign country,

01:13.410 --> 01:16.830
working in Pittsburgh.
It gives you a lot of freedom.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.830
In addition to freedom,
it gives you a different perspective.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.840
You're not so much
a victim of trends,

01:22.920 --> 01:25.340
of popular thinking,
of, you know...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.320
What's in the State-of-the-Art
head right now.

01:32.830 --> 01:36.000
This is a scene from
"Night of the Living Dead,"

01:36.080 --> 01:38.830
a low-budget film
co-authored, directed,

01:38.920 --> 01:41.310
photographed, and edited
by George Romero...

01:41.390 --> 01:43.360
In 1968.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.260
Already the head of a successful
commercial production house in Pittsburgh,

01:47.340 --> 01:50.960
this was his first venture
into feature Filmmaking.

01:51.050 --> 01:53.240
Its flaws were mainly budgetary,

01:53.320 --> 01:56.120
while its virtues
were clearly visionary,

01:56.200 --> 01:59.980
earning it popular success
as a horror film,

02:00.070 --> 02:02.490
and a cult following
for exploratory uses

02:02.570 --> 02:05.570
of genre and technique.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.550
Style is difficult to define.

02:25.630 --> 02:27.540
Even in this disembodied clip

02:27.630 --> 02:29.880
the technical aspects
of Romero's style

02:29.970 --> 02:31.890
are making themselves
apparent...

02:32.870 --> 02:35.190
They're in his cutting...

02:36.480 --> 02:38.430
His camera angles...

02:41.210 --> 02:44.430
In his two-dimensional design
within the film frame...

02:49.120 --> 02:51.840
Great spatial movements
from shot to shot...

02:54.730 --> 02:56.700
And even within shot.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.410
Just making films
in Pittsburgh for 10 years

03:05.490 --> 03:07.960
has become a sort
of stylistic statement.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.960
In January of '78,

03:12.040 --> 03:14.890
Romero and his Producer
Richard Rubinstein

03:14.980 --> 03:17.960
allowed a film crew from the
school of visual arts onto the set

03:18.050 --> 03:19.970
of their latest production,

03:20.050 --> 03:22.030
the second part
of the "Dead" trilogy,

03:22.120 --> 03:24.850
"Dawn of the Dead."

03:24.940 --> 03:27.190
Using footage shot
over one long weekend,

03:27.280 --> 03:29.220
a documentary took shape,

03:29.290 --> 03:31.840
focusing first
on the Filmmaking process

03:31.930 --> 03:35.260
and secondly
on directorial vision...

03:35.350 --> 03:37.630
What part of it
reaches the screen unhampered,

03:37.720 --> 03:40.840
what external forces affect it.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.270
But first,
let's introduce our cast.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.740
In pre-production...
George Romero, Screenwriter.

03:48.810 --> 03:52.230
Richard Rubinstein, Producer.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.990
In production...
George Romero, directing.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.490
Richard Rubinstein, producing.

03:59.580 --> 04:03.000
Michael Gornick,
Cinematographer.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.000
Carl Augenstein,
Lighting Director.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.000
Tom Savini,
Creator of Special Makeup,

04:09.080 --> 04:11.100
Actor and Stuntman.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.760
Ken Foree, Actor.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.760
Scott Reiniger, Actor.

04:18.839 --> 04:22.260
David Emge, Actor.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.770
John Amplas, Actor in "Martin"

04:24.850 --> 04:26.770
and Casting Director of "Dawn,"

04:26.850 --> 04:30.270
and in post-production...
Editing the film.

04:33.240 --> 04:36.160
Pre-production involves
writing the screenplay,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.670
raising the money
and organizing the shoot.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.290
- All aboard.
- Good morning.

04:41.370 --> 04:42.790
Hiya.
How long to Pittsburgh?

04:42.870 --> 04:45.290
- 10 hours to Pittsburgh.
- Is there a bar car?

04:45.370 --> 04:47.280
- On your left.
- Thank you.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.170
Madam, traveling alone?
All alone.

04:50.260 --> 04:53.050
- Shall I wake you for Pittsburgh?
- No, I'm going to New York.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.550
- The Big Apple?
- Right?

04:54.630 --> 04:57.550
- Thank you and good night.
- Thank you. Good night.

04:57.630 --> 05:01.430
These are the opening
moments of "Martin,"

05:01.520 --> 05:03.940
the film Romero made
just before "Dawn."

05:04.020 --> 05:06.940
As the story unfolds, you'll
see the screenplay qualities...

05:07.030 --> 05:09.320
All inherently cinematic...

05:09.390 --> 05:11.810
Which begin
to articulate his style.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.820
First the visual imperative.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.810
With few exceptions,
cinema relies

05:17.900 --> 05:20.820
as little as possible
on the spoken word.

05:20.910 --> 05:22.830
Characterization and plot

05:22.910 --> 05:25.830
are best revealed through action

05:25.910 --> 05:28.040
and accumulation of detail.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.720
Montage concepts begin
in the screenplay.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.210
The story is developing
with literally no dialogue,

06:50.300 --> 06:52.720
and suspense is being generated

06:52.800 --> 06:55.220
not only in the horror
of the situation

06:55.300 --> 06:57.710
but in the mystery
of the plot itself.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.830
We still don't know
his identity,

07:00.920 --> 07:03.840
his motives, or his goal.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.350
Romero's use
of dual linear movement

07:14.440 --> 07:17.860
fleshes out the two dimensions
of film into three.

07:17.940 --> 07:21.000
A use of such devices as
the manipulation of time...

07:28.580 --> 07:31.500
Or other devices
such as irony...

08:05.750 --> 08:09.150
As you can see from the final page
of the "Dawn" screenplay,

08:09.240 --> 08:11.650
Romero's use of the form
is unorthodox...

08:11.740 --> 08:13.660
In a medium where one page

08:13.750 --> 08:16.670
generally equals
one minute of film.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.920
The script seems long.
Did you plan to shoot it all?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.920
I mean, giving yourself
leeway in the cutting?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.920
Pretty much.
I usually write long scripts.

08:26.010 --> 08:29.930
"Martin" was a long script
that was really a long script.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.429
The first cut came out at almost
two hours and 45 minutes.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.940
- Wow.
- This is a long script that seems long.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.940
It's not really long.

08:39.020 --> 08:41.429
There is so much description.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.440
And if you read those pages,

08:43.530 --> 08:45.950
there is so much action

08:46.030 --> 08:49.450
described in great paragraphs

08:49.530 --> 08:52.450
where I got carried away
describing the action itself.

08:52.530 --> 08:56.450
Some of those things
take a second and a half.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.460
And it's not cutting that long.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.960
We did...
I cut the first half of the film

09:02.040 --> 09:03.960
and it came in at 45 minutes,

09:04.050 --> 09:06.970
so I think the first cut
will be about a two-hour cut.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.970
- Great.
- Which is not bad for a first cut.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.970
To what extent do other
influences creep into a work?

09:15.060 --> 09:17.480
And at what stage?

09:22.200 --> 09:25.120
A lot of people have
often compared you to Hitchcock.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.630
But you don't buy that.
How come?

09:28.700 --> 09:31.120
They have some nerve.

09:32.710 --> 09:37.130
No, I don't...
Filmmaking is funny.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.130
Filmmakers...
All artists to some extent

09:40.220 --> 09:42.140
are parasitic
of what they've seen,

09:42.220 --> 09:44.640
and what they are
basically imitating,

09:44.720 --> 09:47.140
what attracted them
in the first place.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.140
Filmmakers, maybe
more than any other form,

09:50.230 --> 09:52.650
I mean, it's not like
you can sit down with a pencil

09:52.730 --> 09:55.650
and do your thing...
Or a canvas or whatever.

09:55.730 --> 09:57.640
It's very expensive
and very few people

09:57.730 --> 10:00.150
get enough chance
to work with the hardware,

10:00.240 --> 10:02.660
and get enough chance to really

10:02.740 --> 10:06.160
develop a style...

10:06.240 --> 10:08.150
Except on a very
intellectual level.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.160
That's why unfortunately
the State-of-the-Art

10:11.250 --> 10:14.170
has somewhat gone towards
menus and pre-planning

10:14.250 --> 10:17.170
and everything else...
Which is a little bit destructive.

10:20.760 --> 10:24.680
I would say that if I'm parasitic
of anybody it's more Welles,

10:24.760 --> 10:27.680
and some of the early...
Like Howard Hawks and people like that.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.180
Those were films
that really affected me.

10:32.270 --> 10:34.190
There are certain
Hitchcockian things that...

10:34.270 --> 10:37.690
First of all, I don't consciously
when I'm setting up a shot

10:37.770 --> 10:40.190
say wow, remember
that shot in...

10:40.280 --> 10:42.700
And then try to imitate that.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.200
They are Hitchcock-type
influences...

10:45.280 --> 10:48.200
The sequence in the cemetery in
"Night of the Living Dead"...

10:50.250 --> 10:53.620
Where you see the figure way in the
background and don't know what it is.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.980
And it gradually
gets worked into the plot.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.930
It starts to become a threat,
and then the threat is a real threat.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.170
That's kind of
a Hitchcockian sequence.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.910
Hey, I mean praying's
for church, huh?

11:07.990 --> 11:09.840
Come on.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.340
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.340
Well...

11:14.430 --> 11:17.850
Not much sense
in my going to church.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.850
Do you remember one time
when we were small

11:19.930 --> 11:23.180
we were out here?
It was from right over there.

11:23.270 --> 11:24.790
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree,

11:24.870 --> 11:27.710
and Grandpa got all excited
and he shook his fist at me

11:27.790 --> 11:30.710
and he said,
"Boy, you'll be damned to Hell!"

11:30.790 --> 11:34.170
Remember that?
Right over there.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.730
You used to really be
scared here.

11:36.820 --> 11:40.170
- Johnny!
- You're still afraid.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.170
Stop it now, I mean it.

11:45.710 --> 11:48.630
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

11:49.930 --> 11:51.850
Stop it.
You're ignorant.

11:51.930 --> 11:54.750
They're coming for you, Barbara.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.250
Stop it!
You're acting like a child.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.380
They're coming for you.

11:59.450 --> 12:02.670
Look, there comes
one of them now.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.130
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

12:05.210 --> 12:07.100
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny...

12:07.180 --> 12:09.600
A couple of pieces
that I've seen written

12:09.680 --> 12:12.460
about "Night of the Living Dead"
say that it takes us back

12:12.550 --> 12:14.550
to silent cinema storytelling.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.010
Johnny!
Help me.

12:22.690 --> 12:25.210
I can see now a couple
of specific things

12:25.300 --> 12:28.250
in a couple of my films that are
Hitchcockian in that way.

12:29.530 --> 12:32.330
Sometimes people say it
because of the plot lines...

12:32.420 --> 12:35.840
The very certain ironies
in the plots that I use.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.840
I don't think that
has anything to do with form,

12:37.930 --> 12:40.850
I think that's more a content
association people are making.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.770
"The Thing" was the movie that
knocked me down when I was a kid.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.400
That's the one,
I think, horror film.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.910
Everyone says
"What attracts you to the genre?"

12:49.990 --> 12:51.910
And it was probably
"The Thing."

12:51.990 --> 12:53.910
I was the right age
at exactly the right time

12:53.990 --> 12:57.520
and it had exactly the right effect on me.
I've never forgotten it.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.780
The cineographics
of "The Thing,"

12:59.860 --> 13:01.780
and those of "Night" and "Dawn"

13:01.870 --> 13:04.040
are remarkably similar.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.540
Confined spaces within which
groups of protagonists

13:06.620 --> 13:10.040
are eternally on guard
against a deadly foe.

13:10.130 --> 13:13.520
Tranquility never exists
in Romero's world.

13:13.844 --> 13:17.844
You could say his style is derived from
D.W. Griffith's because he uses closeups.

13:17.990 --> 13:21.877
The truth of it is, artists imprint
distinctive auras on their films.

13:22.073 --> 13:25.606
"Genre" is a term which should
have been invented by the distributors.

13:25.895 --> 13:28.695
For the artist,
it's just a departure point.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.740
Thank you

13:31.402 --> 13:34.002
Casting occurs
in pre-production.

13:34.082 --> 13:36.362
Is it an irony
in both "Night and "Dawn"

13:36.452 --> 13:39.622
that Romero's main
protagonists are black?

13:39.702 --> 13:42.122
In "Night of the Living Dead"

13:42.212 --> 13:44.132
the character,
if you read the script...

13:44.212 --> 13:48.132
If you read my shooting script,

13:48.212 --> 13:50.132
the character is never described

13:50.212 --> 13:52.632
in terms of his color.

13:52.722 --> 13:55.142
And Duane was the best actor
that we knew

13:55.222 --> 13:59.142
from among our friends, which
was where we cast that film...

13:59.222 --> 14:02.142
Where we cast that film.
And so he did the part.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.652
Consciously, I resisted
writing new dialogue

14:04.732 --> 14:07.152
because he happened to be black.

14:07.232 --> 14:09.782
And just let it play
and we just shot the script.

14:09.872 --> 14:12.542
As we started to shoot
and got into it,

14:12.622 --> 14:14.542
we lived at that farmhouse.

14:14.622 --> 14:17.042
So we were always into raps
about the implications

14:17.122 --> 14:19.042
and the meanings
and stuff like that.

14:19.132 --> 14:20.922
Some of that maybe
crept into the film.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.382
I think in both
"Night" and "Dawn"

14:28.472 --> 14:30.762
the biggest job
that all of us had

14:30.842 --> 14:32.762
during the production
of both of those films

14:32.842 --> 14:34.902
was subduing
all of those thoughts.

14:34.982 --> 14:36.942
Those can really interfere
with what you're doing.

14:36.982 --> 14:39.802
What you're doing on the surface
is making a comic book.

14:41.932 --> 14:46.602
Those ironies that you're talking about
are that selection process...

14:46.692 --> 14:49.612
Is something again
that happened at script stage,

14:49.692 --> 14:51.612
or on a consciousness level

14:51.692 --> 14:54.112
somewhere beneath the craft
of making the film.

14:54.336 --> 14:56.600
Our news cameras
have just returned

14:56.639 --> 15:00.127
from covering such a search and
destroy operation against the ghouls.

15:00.162 --> 15:04.151
Themes, motifs, and metaphors

15:04.200 --> 15:05.828
trace back to the
screenplay stage

15:06.835 --> 15:09.839
why does the media play such
an important part in his films?

15:10.032 --> 15:13.746
Have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.

15:14.413 --> 15:19.763
I worked in television for so long, that maybe
it's just an important part of my background.

15:19.830 --> 15:24.093
I also just have a lot of attitudes
about what that "reach",

15:24.261 --> 15:30.484
that whole "communications electronic box" has done
to everybody. So I guess I tend to take "jabs" at it.

15:30.902 --> 15:34.991
The plan is, kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.

15:36.159 --> 15:39.663
- Want anything from the supply wagon?
- No, we're all right.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.300
Hey, cass, put that thing
all the way in the fire.

15:43.335 --> 15:45.964
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right, I gotcha.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.967
Chief McClellan,
how's everything going?

15:48.008 --> 15:51.055
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.808
You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.674
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

15:56.770 --> 15:59.399
Well, we killed 19 of them
today, right in this area.

15:59.607 --> 16:02.862
Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.

16:02.904 --> 16:05.658
They must have thought somebody
was in there. There wasn't, though.

16:06.082 --> 16:09.282
People on the television,
not really answering the question

16:09.406 --> 16:12.906
but making it more confusing,
that's been the conscience part of that.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.130
Because that's generally what it's about.

16:16.437 --> 16:20.077
"Ladies and Gentlemen there was a plane crash
that took out a small piece of Manhattan...

16:20.173 --> 16:21.173
more later."

16:23.526 --> 16:27.350
it's never reassuring,
it's always alarming.

16:28.010 --> 16:29.810
That's been a kind of
conscience through-line.

16:30.112 --> 16:33.932
The Producer is in a key
position during pre-production,

16:34.022 --> 16:36.062
securing funds, putting the film

16:36.142 --> 16:38.562
into a viable financial
and legal position,

16:38.642 --> 16:41.062
and thereafter
protecting the director.

16:41.142 --> 16:44.562
I think that we tend to operate

16:44.652 --> 16:47.072
in more a European style in terms

16:47.152 --> 16:49.572
of the way we produce
and the way George directs,

16:49.652 --> 16:51.562
and that we tend to follow

16:51.652 --> 16:54.572
Sarris' auteur theory of direction,

16:54.662 --> 16:57.582
and that I see
my function as a Producer

16:57.662 --> 17:00.082
in terms of providing
George Romero

17:00.162 --> 17:02.572
with a brush,
palette and canvas.

17:02.662 --> 17:05.082
And his creative control
is absolute

17:05.172 --> 17:08.092
in terms of the film itself...

17:08.172 --> 17:10.592
That he's the scriptwriter,

17:10.672 --> 17:12.472
that he's the director
and he's the editor.

17:12.561 --> 17:16.281
And it's totally the product
of one man's vision on a creative level.

17:16.406 --> 17:22.506
This is the largest budget that George has
had to work with in terms of production.

17:23.883 --> 17:28.716
I think that he's got enough money
here to do what he wants to do.

17:30.092 --> 17:34.892
It's not an excessive amount of money by traditional
Hollywood standards. This is a low-budget picture.

17:35.231 --> 17:40.631
Of course anything under $2½ million dollars is
considered low-budget in terms of major studios.

17:40.662 --> 17:42.542
The biggest difference
really in "Dawn"

17:42.632 --> 17:44.552
is working with
a little bit of money

17:44.632 --> 17:47.552
and still being satisfied
with the product.

17:47.632 --> 17:50.552
In fact, it was easier.
I was paranoid about it upfront,

17:50.642 --> 17:53.562
because just having
that extra weight is a trip.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.562
But I'm comfortable with
what "Dawn of the Dead" is.

17:58.652 --> 18:01.572
And the extra money it
took to make it what it is

18:01.652 --> 18:04.572
was really not a hindrance at all.
It was a big, big help.

18:04.652 --> 18:07.072
A lot of people say
"I can't work with money,

18:07.152 --> 18:09.822
I can't work with a lot
of people around."

18:09.912 --> 18:13.832
This film was financed
in somewhat of a traditional way

18:13.912 --> 18:16.322
in that it's co-financed
internationally,

18:16.412 --> 18:18.832
that a group headed
by Dario Argento

18:18.922 --> 18:22.342
in Italy co-financed
the film with us.

18:22.422 --> 18:24.342
And our end
of the co-financing

18:24.422 --> 18:26.332
comes from private individuals.

18:27.922 --> 18:30.342
I think it was unique
in that this project

18:30.432 --> 18:33.352
started off with two creative
people getting together...

18:33.432 --> 18:35.852
Dario Argento and George Romero.

18:35.932 --> 18:38.712
And then the business side
came after that point.

18:38.802 --> 18:41.722
Now the physical
productions begins.

18:41.812 --> 18:43.732
In this second stage
the Director

18:43.812 --> 18:47.232
and Cinematographer stand
to share equally in importance

18:47.312 --> 18:49.292
for what is captured on film.

18:51.452 --> 18:53.372
It's the eighth week
of the "Dawn" shoot,

18:53.452 --> 18:56.372
we're in an $80 million mall
in Pittsburgh,

18:56.452 --> 18:58.372
which Romero is allowed
to use each night

18:58.462 --> 19:00.382
from 11:00 till 7:00
in the morning.

19:01.962 --> 19:04.382
- Everyone ready?
- Camera?

19:04.462 --> 19:06.372
- It's rolling.
- Sound.

19:17.472 --> 19:19.392
Cut.

19:24.982 --> 19:27.902
He does not get uptight,

19:27.982 --> 19:30.402
he asks me if it's possible

19:30.492 --> 19:32.912
and asks me how much time
it's gonna take.

19:32.992 --> 19:36.412
And then he'll give me a straight
"yes" or "no" on whether to do it.

19:36.492 --> 19:39.412
There's no bullshit,
there's no yelling,

19:39.502 --> 19:40.922
it's been a very...

19:41.002 --> 19:43.422
For shooting this long
under these conditions

19:43.502 --> 19:45.822
I'd say it's been
absolutely wonderful.

19:45.902 --> 19:47.802
George Romero

19:47.892 --> 19:49.812
directs pretty much
the way he is...

19:49.892 --> 19:52.312
Pleasant, relaxed,

19:53.092 --> 19:55.012
great sense of humor.

19:55.026 --> 19:57.959
And intelligent,
so the combinations work well.

19:57.964 --> 20:01.164
There's no hurry,
there's no pressure,

20:01.354 --> 20:02.654
we discuss it.

20:02.753 --> 20:04.753
And usually a very few words are exchanged.

20:04.891 --> 20:07.791
There are ideas, a few words
and we've got it.

20:08.072 --> 20:12.272
The man's like water and you're a ship,
so you just float along and do the job.

20:13.197 --> 20:14.197
Okay.

20:14.658 --> 20:15.658
Ready?

20:16.065 --> 20:17.065
Quiet.

20:19.038 --> 20:20.038
Action.

20:20.672 --> 20:23.022
The best thing about him
is that he gets across

20:23.112 --> 20:25.032
what he wants
without telling you.

20:25.112 --> 20:27.532
I don't know how he does it,
but it's incredible.

20:27.612 --> 20:30.032
'Cause he's so clear about what
he wants all the time.

20:30.122 --> 20:34.042
I think when he's working
he's editing at the same time.

20:34.122 --> 20:36.032
When he says it looks good,

20:36.122 --> 20:39.042
we've learned that indeed
it will look good,

20:39.132 --> 20:41.052
because he has a very good eye.

20:41.132 --> 20:44.052
The atmosphere which pervaded
the "Dawn" shoot

20:44.132 --> 20:47.052
was unusual for a film production
in this country.

20:47.132 --> 20:49.052
And while good films
have been created

20:49.142 --> 20:52.562
by directors who were
universally despised,

20:52.642 --> 20:54.562
there's no doubt
that chemistry counts.

20:57.142 --> 21:00.062
I think George likes
confidence in his crew,

21:00.152 --> 21:03.072
but I think he likes to work with
people he feels at ease with.

21:03.152 --> 21:05.022
They have to be confident,
but beyond that

21:05.102 --> 21:07.482
he likes people he can work with till
7:00 in the morning

21:07.572 --> 21:10.492
like we did today...
And feel at ease with them.

21:10.572 --> 21:13.492
There's a lot of rapping
that goes on constantly on the shoots.

21:13.582 --> 21:17.002
A lot of fun
and a lot of hard work.

21:17.082 --> 21:20.502
It's a joy working with George,
because he accepts a lot of input

21:20.582 --> 21:24.002
in terms of what I see or...
It's amazing that even suggestions

21:24.092 --> 21:27.512
that come oftentimes
from crew members through me...

21:27.592 --> 21:31.012
And he's very willing
to accept those observations.

21:31.092 --> 21:33.372
A lot of his film is
input from the crew.

21:33.462 --> 21:35.882
A lot of freedom...
It's a real democracy with George.

21:41.972 --> 21:44.492
The "Dawn" production
took a month off in December

21:44.582 --> 21:48.502
rather than remove and restore
the holiday decorations every night,

21:48.982 --> 21:51.402
losing hours of shooting time.

21:51.482 --> 21:55.402
Romero used that month
to cut what he had already shot.

21:55.492 --> 21:57.412
By the time
the school crew arrived,

21:57.492 --> 21:59.912
four weeks into the second
round of shooting,

21:59.992 --> 22:02.412
he had covered the screenplay
well enough

22:02.492 --> 22:06.412
to stop at any point and edit the
footage into release form.

22:06.502 --> 22:09.422
It was now
in an improvisational stage

22:09.502 --> 22:11.892
where new ideas
were being developed.

22:11.972 --> 22:14.892
This picture's really
designed for right now.

22:14.972 --> 22:17.752
It's much more of a comic book...
It's much lighter.

22:17.842 --> 22:20.642
It didn't seem so in the script.

22:20.732 --> 22:23.152
In fact, the scene
we saw being shot yesterday,

22:23.232 --> 22:25.652
the pie fight...

22:25.732 --> 22:27.652
And I'd heard rumors

22:27.732 --> 22:30.152
that the ending
has been also changed.

22:30.242 --> 22:32.162
Yeah, in fact, we shot both,

22:32.242 --> 22:35.112
because I wasn't willing
to give up the tragic ending.

22:35.192 --> 22:38.112
But this film,
"Dawn of the Dead"

22:38.202 --> 22:41.622
has... it's a very
romanticized film.

22:43.532 --> 22:45.952
MI vida!
Miguelito.

22:50.832 --> 22:53.252
The major change that's happened

22:53.332 --> 22:55.252
that I can see
from my conceptions

22:55.332 --> 22:58.252
upon first reading it and now

22:58.332 --> 23:01.252
is that it's lightening up.

23:01.342 --> 23:03.262
You know?

23:03.342 --> 23:06.762
When I first read it, I thought
it was awfully shocking

23:06.842 --> 23:11.262
to think just in terms of
numbers of bodies being maimed

23:11.352 --> 23:14.772
and gallons of blood
being spilled,

23:14.852 --> 23:16.762
but there is a quality
coming out

23:16.852 --> 23:20.272
that is
counter-weighting that.

23:22.362 --> 23:26.782
It's definitely becoming
more of a fantasy to me...

23:26.862 --> 23:29.282
More of an adventure
to me than I first

23:29.372 --> 23:32.822
conceived of it
upon first reading it.

23:33.462 --> 23:35.232
I think the number
of the special effects

23:35.352 --> 23:37.772
are a substantial
portion of the budget,

23:37.852 --> 23:39.272
where prior to this

23:39.352 --> 23:42.272
they were less so
in George's other films.

23:42.352 --> 23:45.772
It's the number of explosions, the number
of cosmetic effects that Tom Savinl does.

23:49.642 --> 23:50.472
Ya!

23:50.562 --> 23:52.482
Those things take
a certain amount of time

23:52.572 --> 23:55.492
and a certain amount of budgetary
support in order to...

23:55.572 --> 23:58.632
Get them to work.
They don't always work the first time.

23:58.702 --> 24:01.122
A squib is simply a detonator.

24:01.212 --> 24:04.132
But we placed
the detonator in a tube

24:04.212 --> 24:06.132
that was filled with gunpowder.

24:06.212 --> 24:09.462
And that was placed inside
a prophylactic which was filled with blood.

24:09.552 --> 24:12.422
So when the blast went off,
the concussion blew

24:12.502 --> 24:15.922
the prophylactic and the blood
from beneath the clothing.

24:16.012 --> 24:17.932
We're in this mall
when the mall closes,

24:18.012 --> 24:19.932
the mall closes
9:30 or so.

24:20.012 --> 24:22.432
We start coming in around 8:00
to get set up and everything.

24:22.512 --> 24:25.932
We only have until 7:00 in the morning
before we have to stop shooting,

24:26.022 --> 24:28.942
because we got to get all our
stuff out when the mall opens.

24:29.022 --> 24:31.332
They'll be times
in a particular night

24:31.402 --> 24:33.322
where we're shooting
all over the script.

24:33.412 --> 24:36.452
It has to be done fast, because that
all has to be done in seven hours.

24:39.032 --> 24:41.452
George is a wonderful guy.
You can say to George...

24:41.532 --> 24:43.492
He'll be very cool...
No expression on his face...

24:43.532 --> 24:46.452
You can say to him,
"George I've got this fabulous idea,

24:46.542 --> 24:48.462
why don't we take
a screwdriver...

24:50.792 --> 24:53.212
Say the maintenance man
has a screwdriver on his belt,

24:53.292 --> 24:55.212
and have the maintenance man
zombie attack scott.

25:06.192 --> 25:08.232
Scott pulls a screwdriver
out of his bag

25:08.312 --> 25:12.122
and sticks it in the zombie's ear,
shoves it in the brain.

25:13.952 --> 25:15.872
George will go "okay."

25:15.952 --> 25:18.372
You could say "George,
how about if we get dragons

25:18.452 --> 25:20.362
coming out of the fountains
in the mall?"

25:20.452 --> 25:23.372
I'm sure he'd go, "yeah, okay, yeah."
You can't shake him.

25:23.462 --> 25:25.752
The first half of the shooting
was very organized

25:25.832 --> 25:27.752
and there wasn't
a great deal of improvisation

25:27.832 --> 25:30.632
because most of the big
effects were done in the first part.

25:30.712 --> 25:32.882
The things George wrote in the script,
we planned ahead.

25:32.972 --> 25:35.392
We knew exactly...
We would stand in the office

25:35.472 --> 25:37.892
and he would walk the whole
thing through and be a zombie,

25:37.972 --> 25:41.902
be the victim, be the helicopter.
Very organized.

25:41.972 --> 25:43.892
This shoot's a little different.

25:43.982 --> 25:46.402
We've created characters
on our own.

25:46.482 --> 25:50.402
I've created a character and a friend,
a stunt-man's created a character.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.402
He's been developing
those characters

25:52.482 --> 25:54.902
as we shoot...
Day by day.

25:54.992 --> 25:58.412
So it's like really loose,
this half of the shoot.

25:59.492 --> 26:01.412
And just as much fun.

26:01.492 --> 26:03.912
How many zombies
are you making up a night?

26:04.002 --> 26:07.422
It depends on what
we're doing in the script.

26:07.502 --> 26:10.422
Some nights we'll have 200,
sometimes we'll have five.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.422
The nights we have five,
they're the concentrated scenes

26:13.512 --> 26:15.432
between one lead,

26:15.512 --> 26:17.432
and we put five around him
so it looks like

26:17.512 --> 26:20.432
a continuation of the 200
the day before.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.432
It depends, like I say,

26:22.512 --> 26:24.932
it depends on what's in
the script for that night.

26:27.022 --> 26:29.442
Can you explain
what you're doing right now?

26:29.522 --> 26:33.442
Okay, these are foam latex appliances
I'm sticking on his face.

26:33.532 --> 26:36.452
These are zombies... Or people that
have died in interesting ways...

26:36.532 --> 26:40.422
Or not interesting ways, just people
who have died and come back to life.

26:40.502 --> 26:43.912
A lot of them look like
car accident victims,

26:43.992 --> 26:45.912
cancer patients.

26:45.992 --> 26:49.412
One guy came in here in a three-piece
suit, beautiful three-piece suit,

26:49.492 --> 26:51.402
so I made him up like
a mortician would

26:51.492 --> 26:54.162
at a funeral parlor.
And he was like "beautiful."

26:54.252 --> 26:56.172
Overly made-up
with lipstick and all that.

26:56.252 --> 26:59.172
So he was walking around
like a fresh one.

26:59.252 --> 27:02.922
Okay, you have to lean forward just a bit
so I can powder all this.

27:03.012 --> 27:05.682
It'll probably get
all over your shirt here.

27:05.762 --> 27:08.682
Others are people who have
been bitten by other zombies

27:08.762 --> 27:10.672
and who have died
and become zombies.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.682
And they're the ones
that are the grossest.

27:12.772 --> 27:15.442
I don't know what happened to you...
A car accident,

27:15.522 --> 27:17.442
zombie bit your face off
or something like that.

27:17.522 --> 27:20.812
The fun of this thing
is inventing all this stuff.

27:23.492 --> 27:25.912
Can you close your eyes?

27:26.002 --> 27:27.922
And I'm covering them
with this stuff

27:28.002 --> 27:29.922
called rubber mask greasepaint.

27:30.002 --> 27:33.762
It's a greasepaint that has
more castor oil in it.

27:33.842 --> 27:36.762
It keeps the rubber piece from
drying out and changing color

27:36.842 --> 27:38.632
after the makeup
has been on it for a while.

27:38.712 --> 27:40.682
You sculpt them in clay.
You make a mold of them,

27:40.762 --> 27:44.182
and you pour foam latex in the mold...
You bake it in an oven.

27:44.262 --> 27:47.182
I took a big photo tray
and sculpted a zillion wounds,

27:47.272 --> 27:49.692
cast them...
And I had those and I did another one...

27:49.772 --> 27:51.692
Cast them
and I had those wounds.

27:51.772 --> 27:54.682
When I'm making a piece
and I have foam latex left over,

27:54.772 --> 27:58.192
I'll pour it in one of these slabs, and
I'll have extra wounds laying around.

27:58.282 --> 28:00.202
Are there any schools
that teach that?

28:00.282 --> 28:02.202
No, not that I know of.
I had to teach myself.

28:07.402 --> 28:10.322
The director must be
a psychologist.

28:12.912 --> 28:15.832
He must also be
a story-boarder,

28:15.912 --> 28:17.822
an editor...

28:17.912 --> 28:19.832
Linking the disparate
sensibilities

28:19.922 --> 28:22.342
of cast and crew
with his own vision.

28:22.422 --> 28:25.342
Okay, if it's straight up,
we can do it with hands.

28:25.422 --> 28:28.342
Tom Savini, now on
the other side of the camera,

28:28.422 --> 28:30.342
is about to assay
a difficult stunt

28:30.432 --> 28:33.352
which will portray
his demise onscreen.

28:33.432 --> 28:36.352
One can see under these
specialized circumstances,

28:36.432 --> 28:39.352
Romero effortlessly
fulfilling his ongoing roles

28:39.442 --> 28:42.362
as prime mover
of the production.

28:42.442 --> 28:46.362
- Keep going, keep going.
- Ready, Tom?

28:46.442 --> 28:50.492
Keep going...
Okay, okay, good.

28:52.082 --> 28:54.862
- Hold on, Tom.
- All set?

28:54.952 --> 28:56.862
- Any time.
- Are you rolling?

28:56.952 --> 28:59.002
Stand by. You gonna
go right there, Tom?

28:59.092 --> 29:02.012
Yeah, from here.

29:02.092 --> 29:05.622
- Ready, Mike?
- Hold on.

29:05.712 --> 29:08.682
Do you have
Shelby's hand in the light?

29:08.762 --> 29:10.182
Holding the bench on the left?

29:10.272 --> 29:13.272
- I can't see any bench.
- Quiet, please.

29:19.362 --> 29:21.282
- Okay, Mike?
- Beautiful.

29:21.362 --> 29:23.782
Out of sight, beautiful.

29:30.372 --> 29:32.792
What about the approach
you're taking in directing it?

29:32.872 --> 29:34.782
I thought
"Night of the Living Dead"

29:34.872 --> 29:37.792
was pretty tightly story-boarded.
Is that true?

29:37.882 --> 29:40.802
It was and it wasn't.
A lot of the sequences were,

29:40.882 --> 29:43.302
as a lot of the sequences
in this film are.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.802
Oh, 'cause while we've been here,
it seems very loose.

29:46.892 --> 29:49.812
It's been loose, but you've been here
only for a few scenes too.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.802
Some of the scenes...

29:54.392 --> 29:57.812
As you watch the interlock
I think, you'll find to be

29:57.902 --> 30:00.942
very, very close to the way
that script is written.

30:01.022 --> 30:03.442
Story-boarding refers
most commonly

30:03.522 --> 30:07.442
to a series of artists'
renderings prepared in pre-production.

30:07.522 --> 30:12.042
In production, each shot will
correspond to one of these sketches.

30:12.132 --> 30:13.532
George is a genius
in that respect.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.532
He can memorize
his own storyboards.

30:15.612 --> 30:17.532
He prepares them himself.

30:17.622 --> 30:20.542
And Chris, his A.D.,
has helped in that respect too.

30:20.622 --> 30:23.542
But he doesn't literally
storyboard his shots.

30:23.622 --> 30:26.542
He's a very complex director.

30:26.632 --> 30:28.552
He likes to keep it to himself

30:28.632 --> 30:32.052
in terms of the actual story-boarding
of blocking scenes.

30:32.132 --> 30:35.052
And he brings it with him to the set.
That's his style.

30:35.132 --> 30:38.052
There are certain things
that I want to happen

30:38.142 --> 30:40.562
that build on each other.

30:42.142 --> 30:45.062
In this film,
the people starting to get

30:45.142 --> 30:47.062
tempted and attracted
by the mall.

30:47.152 --> 30:49.572
And starting to get...

30:49.652 --> 30:54.572
Adopting the military
approach to taking it over.

30:54.652 --> 30:58.572
And those are the things
that I've tried to keep

30:58.662 --> 31:00.582
as close as possible
to the script...

31:00.662 --> 31:03.582
The sequence when they
go and get the trucks

31:03.662 --> 31:06.582
and block off
the outside of the mall.

31:06.672 --> 31:09.092
Because there is a certain build

31:09.172 --> 31:11.592
that was written
into the script,

31:11.672 --> 31:13.592
which I really think adds to...

31:16.182 --> 31:19.102
The overall flow
of the suspense of the film.

31:21.682 --> 31:23.602
Martin.

31:26.822 --> 31:29.242
Here in a later scene
from "Martin,"

31:29.322 --> 31:31.352
Romero's modern vampire story,

31:31.442 --> 31:34.002
one can feel a tight
pre-structured quality

31:34.082 --> 31:36.352
indicative
of story-boarding.

31:38.532 --> 31:40.442
I had a copy of the script

31:40.532 --> 31:43.702
about a month and a half or two
before we started shooting.

31:43.792 --> 31:46.462
And he already had it
story-boarded to an extent.

31:54.132 --> 31:56.192
Martin.

31:59.602 --> 32:03.022
There's a lot of quick cuts
of you creeping down hallways,

32:03.112 --> 32:05.532
and how would you hit
your mark emotionally?

32:05.612 --> 32:08.532
I generally didn't worry
about it emotionally.

32:08.612 --> 32:12.532
I was more interestedin hitting the mark...
In being in the right place.

32:14.122 --> 32:15.542
Martin.

32:15.622 --> 32:18.042
Martin.

32:18.122 --> 32:20.042
Martin!

32:20.122 --> 32:22.292
Martin?

32:35.502 --> 32:38.302
- Who are you?
- Oh my God.

32:38.392 --> 32:41.312
Look, let's not get
excited about this now.

32:41.392 --> 32:44.812
There's no reason to get upset.

32:44.902 --> 32:46.322
I don't know him!

32:52.652 --> 32:55.572
Were the scenes
very tightly blocked off?

32:55.662 --> 32:59.082
They weren't tightly blocked,
but they were blocked.

32:59.162 --> 33:03.582
Because of being
such an action scene,

33:03.672 --> 33:05.092
we had written blocking

33:05.172 --> 33:08.592
just as if we would work
in a theater.

33:08.672 --> 33:10.582
Of course,
"Martin" was a small shoot...

33:10.672 --> 33:14.202
Generally not more than eight
people on the set in total.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.712
"Dawn" had, I think, 35 in
staff and hundreds in actors.

33:17.802 --> 33:20.222
- Yeah, many nights, hundreds.
- And his attention

33:20.302 --> 33:22.722
was being pulled away
all too often.

33:22.802 --> 33:25.852
So he kept himself
pretty much by himself during that.

33:25.942 --> 33:29.362
But his overall attitude with actors
was pretty much the same.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.862
Your role in "Dawn" was on
the other side of the camera.

33:32.942 --> 33:34.862
I was Casting Director.

33:34.952 --> 33:37.742
Mostly my job
was recruiting zombies.

33:37.822 --> 33:40.742
Creative compromise is the name
of the game in Filmmaking.

33:40.822 --> 33:43.742
Logistics of production
force one to make decisions

33:43.822 --> 33:47.492
counter to the original concept,
but ultimately beneficial.

33:47.582 --> 33:50.002
We were talking before
about the fact

33:50.082 --> 33:53.502
that when he got to the mall,
it had a different atmosphere

33:53.582 --> 33:56.502
than he already thought

33:56.592 --> 33:58.512
about "Dawn" having.

33:58.592 --> 34:01.512
The mall also brought
a futuristic look to the film.

34:01.592 --> 34:03.762
It was so vast.

34:03.842 --> 34:06.262
The idea of the mall itself,

34:06.352 --> 34:10.272
the moment we see it,
the moment we come in and see what it is,

34:10.351 --> 34:13.772
I think it's gonna
become obvious

34:13.851 --> 34:15.772
in terms of what
we're saying about

34:15.851 --> 34:20.272
the false security
of consumer society.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.282
It's a great metaphor.

34:22.362 --> 34:24.272
It's a great set, too.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.282
- Great location, really.
- Great location.

34:26.371 --> 34:28.792
We couldn't do it
without a mall like this.

34:28.871 --> 34:30.792
We were really lucky to get it.

34:30.871 --> 34:33.792
How's it been working with it?
Have there been problems?

34:33.871 --> 34:35.292
There have been
a few problems...

34:35.371 --> 34:37.792
- Mainly technical?
- Mainly technical.

34:37.882 --> 34:39.802
No real people problems at all.

34:39.882 --> 34:42.302
When I read it,
I could easily picture the editing.

34:42.382 --> 34:44.792
I mean your style,
between the angles.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.802
But I didn't picture
the color designs

34:46.891 --> 34:49.812
- or what the mall would look like.
- All of those influences...

34:49.891 --> 34:53.812
Everyone's attitude toward the thing,
as well as my own desire,

34:53.891 --> 34:57.312
I think, to brighten things up...
go more action adventure.

35:06.912 --> 35:09.082
First of all
you're dealing, as I said,

35:09.162 --> 35:11.582
with 3-400 extras
in some scenes,

35:11.662 --> 35:13.582
you're dealing
with a shopping mall

35:13.662 --> 35:16.082
as our primary set,
where their primary business

35:16.162 --> 35:18.082
is in fact selling
consumer goods.

35:18.172 --> 35:21.092
And integrating what we want
to do with the life of the mall

35:21.172 --> 35:23.982
has been an arduous
and complicated task.

35:24.062 --> 35:25.982
There is no way to pay...

35:26.062 --> 35:28.982
Or let's say that there is,
but it's way beyond our capacity to pay

35:29.062 --> 35:31.472
in dollar values what the
use of the mall is worth.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.482
The people that own
the shopping mall

35:33.572 --> 35:35.992
have been aesthetically
attached to Filmmaking

35:36.072 --> 35:39.492
and they are getting enough money
so it doesn't cost them anything

35:39.572 --> 35:41.602
to have us in here,

35:41.692 --> 35:45.622
which is an expensive
proposition in itself.

35:45.692 --> 35:47.612
But in terms of looking at it,

35:47.702 --> 35:50.122
are they making a profit
on our being involved with them?

35:50.202 --> 35:52.122
No, that's not the case.

35:52.202 --> 35:55.112
- What about insurance?
- Insurance is a very costly item...

35:55.202 --> 35:58.722
Particularly where you're
dealing in public places.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.512
If a little old lady
tends to see a zombie,

36:03.602 --> 36:06.522
or happens to see a zombie
wandering around with makeup

36:06.602 --> 36:09.142
and has a heart attack,
that's a potential problem.

36:09.222 --> 36:12.392
I don't want to limit that
to little old ladies, but anyone.

36:12.472 --> 36:15.392
So, yes the insurance...

36:15.472 --> 36:19.492
Tab on this particular picture
is a substantial number.

36:19.982 --> 36:22.902
You all right?
You okay?

36:22.982 --> 36:26.402
- - Yeah, I'm all right.
- All right, Savini.

36:26.492 --> 36:29.412
All right, Savini.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.262
Obviously you can't
light a place this size

36:36.342 --> 36:39.762
without spending
a week to light it.

36:39.842 --> 36:42.762
We discussed doing the
whole thing in one shot...

36:42.852 --> 36:45.272
Rehearsing 30 days
and shoot it one day.

36:48.352 --> 36:50.272
So we have to keep it pretty low

36:50.352 --> 36:52.772
otherwise there would
be really dead areas.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.782
The situation
is not enough time,

36:55.862 --> 36:57.782
not enough lights

36:57.862 --> 37:00.782
and incredibly large spaces
to deal with.

37:00.872 --> 37:05.292
And I think the large spaces
and the fact that we're shooting

37:05.372 --> 37:08.292
a large number of angles
on any given shot

37:08.372 --> 37:11.292
are the biggest problem.

37:11.382 --> 37:14.802
We'll do a setup,
an initial setup and shoot one angle.

37:14.882 --> 37:18.302
And the director
will immediately call for a reversal on it.

37:18.382 --> 37:21.802
Normally, that's not
too big a problem,

37:21.892 --> 37:24.312
but in this case,
one reversal might

37:24.392 --> 37:27.812
encompass 200 or 300 feet

37:27.892 --> 37:30.022
of mall area

37:30.112 --> 37:32.012
where you have background
just to fill in,

37:32.102 --> 37:34.522
just to create touches
to avoid black holes.

37:34.602 --> 37:38.022
Hotspots... There's glass
everywhere creating reflections.

37:38.102 --> 37:41.022
My first reaction
was total panic.

37:41.112 --> 37:43.032
I aggravated myself to death,

37:43.112 --> 37:45.912
because I really...
I wanted it to be better.

37:45.992 --> 37:48.412
The initial shots were so big

37:48.502 --> 37:50.922
that I had to use every light

37:51.002 --> 37:53.422
to its absolute fullest amount.

37:53.502 --> 37:57.422
I couldn't skip
a couple of sections

37:57.512 --> 37:59.932
and say, "I'll fill them
in with another light."

38:00.012 --> 38:03.302
I had to know that between every
10 feet there had to be something,

38:03.382 --> 38:05.302
or every certain area
there had to be

38:05.382 --> 38:07.302
a highlight or a spot.
I had to know that.

38:07.382 --> 38:09.292
And I had to know
exactly what it was.

38:09.382 --> 38:11.302
And I went back to my books

38:11.392 --> 38:13.312
and I read performance figures

38:13.392 --> 38:16.452
on every lamp that I have,
and measured things

38:16.522 --> 38:18.942
and went through it
over and over again.

38:19.032 --> 38:21.952
And finally it came out.

38:22.032 --> 38:24.952
We got the initial
setup done and it worked.

38:25.032 --> 38:28.952
And I felt likeabout five million pounds
was taken off of my head.

38:29.042 --> 38:31.962
While we're swinging with it
on the very, very big shots

38:32.042 --> 38:34.462
right here, right now
we're using a lot of tungsten.

38:34.542 --> 38:36.962
We're pushing one stop...

38:37.042 --> 38:39.962
And we're working with ease
under that situation.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.972
For the very, very big shots
we're pushing one again

38:43.052 --> 38:46.482
and using some zeiss...

38:46.552 --> 38:48.472
- Distagon.
- Distagon lenses,

38:48.562 --> 38:52.982
with the 1.4 which gives us
plenty of light to shoot under.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.520
So then the basis
of this film for me

38:55.600 --> 38:59.020
is to go in and set up areas,

38:59.100 --> 39:01.520
set a main source of light.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.020
And that's not particularly a key light,
it's a source of light,

39:05.110 --> 39:07.530
whether it be
a lamp or ceiling light

39:07.610 --> 39:09.900
or a window light...
Whatever it is.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.400
Then I sit back
and I look at what's there

39:12.480 --> 39:14.390
and build upon that.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.900
A lot of the situations
are available light,

39:16.990 --> 39:20.410
because it's the only
possible way to shoot it.

39:20.490 --> 39:22.410
The shots are either too large

39:22.490 --> 39:25.290
or the movement
is too fast to light.

39:25.380 --> 39:29.300
That's really the biggest problem
is this time situation.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.300
We've managed by doing
basically area lighting

39:32.390 --> 39:34.810
by bouncing a lot
of light around

39:34.890 --> 39:36.810
creating natural effects.

39:36.890 --> 39:39.310
Not lighting to the shot,
but lighting areas.

39:41.890 --> 39:44.430
- Let's go.
- Okay, arrives at the column.

39:44.510 --> 39:46.930
Ricochets ready?

39:47.020 --> 39:49.940
Let's go for one more...
Let's go for just one more shot.

39:50.020 --> 39:54.440
You have it in, and you come off
with the big cocking action.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.440
Fire 'em off the launch towards you.
And then just hold.

39:57.530 --> 40:01.950
'Cause you can always hold in aiming mode
when you realize that there's too many...

40:07.540 --> 40:10.960
Like you see more of them
coming around the corner.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.460
Ready, Mike?

40:17.550 --> 40:19.470
Quiet.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.970
- Sound?
- Rolling.

40:21.050 --> 40:22.970
659, take 7.
Sound 1343.

40:23.850 --> 40:27.280
I had never worked with any other
director in terms of a feature.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.270
I know the reaction
to George's style

40:29.360 --> 40:31.780
as to how he'd get
so many setups in one hour,

40:31.860 --> 40:34.780
while other directors might
spend 3-4 hours on eight shots.

40:34.860 --> 40:37.530
Whereas George, I don't think,
could ever do that.

40:37.610 --> 40:40.530
Yeah, we have discussed
angles and style

40:40.620 --> 40:42.540
on a previous film we did
called "Martin."

40:42.620 --> 40:46.290
We pretty much maintain that mood
when we shoot horror stuff...

40:46.370 --> 40:48.650
Which is a lot of wide angle,

40:48.740 --> 40:50.290
low positions

40:50.380 --> 40:53.920
that accentuate
the monster aspects

40:54.000 --> 40:56.420
of the zombies or whatever.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.020
That's pretty much it
in terms of any adapted style

41:02.110 --> 41:05.510
which we have intensified
in this film

41:05.590 --> 41:08.010
or any previous horror films
which we've done.

41:10.980 --> 41:14.150
This film allows us to be a little
more graceful, a little more beautiful

41:14.230 --> 41:17.010
with our photography because
it's not simply a horror film.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.520
One of our worries was we were getting a
little too far away from the horror genre.

41:20.610 --> 41:23.530
But I can help it along...
I understand where he's going.

41:23.610 --> 41:26.530
I've worked with him enough
that I understand his direction.

41:26.610 --> 41:30.030
George tends to set up scenes
and then let them happen,

41:30.120 --> 41:32.040
rather than being
extremely precise

41:32.120 --> 41:34.540
about every movement
of every actor,

41:34.620 --> 41:36.530
and the delivery of every line.

41:36.620 --> 41:39.170
If he's not happy with the way it
comes out the first time,

41:39.260 --> 41:42.180
he will do another take obviously.
Mm-hmm.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.180
But, I think
overall style-wise,

41:44.260 --> 41:45.680
I think that it's consistent.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.690
I think that it's
a little more traditional

41:47.770 --> 41:50.690
in that he is using... how can I say...
a more standard approach

41:50.770 --> 41:53.680
in terms of reverses
and two-shots on dialogue and the like...

41:53.770 --> 41:55.690
Not a lot but somewhat.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.200
We shoot anywhere
from 15-20 to one.

42:05.790 --> 42:08.710
Senores, please to let me pass.

42:08.790 --> 42:13.210
I cover conversations
with the master.

42:13.290 --> 42:14.710
No, no, no, please.

42:14.790 --> 42:17.710
Just let me pass.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.220
I go up to seventh floor
find my sister.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.720
Then with single head shots
on everybody involved.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.720
People of 107 will do
what you wish now.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.220
These are simple people.
They have little,

42:28.310 --> 42:30.230
but they do not
give it up easily.

42:30.310 --> 42:32.230
And their dead
they give up to no one.

42:32.310 --> 42:34.230
Not so much cutaways,

42:34.310 --> 42:36.230
in other words, I'll cut
to all of the people

42:36.320 --> 42:38.740
or I'll use people
as their own cutaways.

42:38.820 --> 42:43.240
Many have died last week,
on these streets.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.740
In the basement of this building,
you will find them.

42:47.430 --> 42:50.350
I have given them
the last rites.

42:50.430 --> 42:53.340
Now, you do what you will.

42:53.830 --> 42:56.750
You are stronger than us,

42:56.840 --> 42:59.260
but soon I think...

42:59.340 --> 43:01.260
They be stronger than you.

43:01.340 --> 43:03.750
And sometimes if I see
a shot I like

43:03.840 --> 43:06.260
I'll just go do it...
Almost on whim.

43:06.350 --> 43:10.270
When the dead walk, Senores,

43:10.350 --> 43:12.270
we must stop the killing

43:12.350 --> 43:14.270
or lose the war.

43:20.980 --> 43:24.340
Out here, shooting, I don't really
think too much about cutting,

43:25.110 --> 43:27.280
I'd rather let that happen too.

43:27.370 --> 43:30.290
Except in tightly choreographed sequences,
like the truck scene

43:30.370 --> 43:33.290
where I know
what's cutting to what.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.280
In this action scene

43:50.360 --> 43:53.030
notice how he has isolated
the three leads

43:53.110 --> 43:55.910
to better manipulate
the visuals...

43:58.400 --> 44:01.570
Close-ups, medium shots,

44:01.650 --> 44:02.650
long shots

44:06.610 --> 44:09.030
come on. Look, man.

44:09.110 --> 44:11.670
Visceral, disorienting angles,

44:11.740 --> 44:14.910
rhythm and tension
potentials to be inherited

44:15.000 --> 44:18.540
by himself on the editing table.

44:35.490 --> 44:39.910
The most celebrated shot
in "Night" is this one.

44:39.990 --> 44:42.080
A close-up of one zombie
gives way

44:42.160 --> 44:45.000
to an extreme
long shot of several of them.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.450
And the film transforms
into a vision of doom.

44:50.330 --> 44:53.050
A revelation in space,
multiplies the horror

44:53.140 --> 44:55.560
far beyond our expectations.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.420
As a spatial stylist,
Romero is consistent.

45:00.510 --> 45:03.390
He is a master
of spatial design.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.400
I never really put it down
to the use of space,

45:06.480 --> 45:08.400
except that's what it is.

45:08.490 --> 45:10.410
It has to do with, uh...

45:10.490 --> 45:13.410
Again, it's just
breaking from tradition.

45:13.490 --> 45:15.910
There are ways
that you're supposed to shoot that...

45:15.990 --> 45:18.910
Involving screen direction
and involving

45:19.000 --> 45:20.920
a formal patternized
kind of cutting,

45:21.000 --> 45:22.420
which I just don't like.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.420
I think as part... if the scene
is a tension-filled scene,

45:25.500 --> 45:28.420
or if it's a suspenseful scene
or a very active scene

45:28.510 --> 45:30.430
which is meant to grate...

45:32.030 --> 45:34.080
Everything should grate.

45:42.670 --> 45:45.090
Get its head up!

45:45.170 --> 45:46.200
Get its head up!

45:47.990 --> 45:50.160
Roger, get its head up, man!

46:20.040 --> 46:21.960
No matter how much
you work with film,

46:22.040 --> 46:23.950
it never ceases to amaze
me how different it is

46:24.040 --> 46:26.460
once it's up there,
and you're watching all your footage.

46:26.550 --> 46:28.470
It's very hard to translate
when you're on the set.

46:28.550 --> 46:31.470
You can't imagine what it's
going to look like in two dimensions,

46:31.550 --> 46:33.960
up there that big
with electronic amplification.

46:34.050 --> 46:36.470
But I don't think
it's insecurity

46:36.560 --> 46:38.980
to say, "I'm not sure
how this going to work out,

46:39.060 --> 46:42.480
so we're going to shoot it another way.
" That's just exploration.

46:42.560 --> 46:44.980
A lot of film is like watercolor...
It's a lot of accidents

46:45.060 --> 46:47.480
and it's learning how
to control the accidents.

46:47.570 --> 46:50.110
That's where you need to just
keep doing a lot of work.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.520
Goodbye, creep.

47:48.850 --> 47:50.770
The key creative force

47:50.850 --> 47:53.270
in post-production
is the editor.

47:53.350 --> 47:55.760
Who, in this case,
also happens to be the director.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.640
There are a few scenes...
Like a housing project scene

47:58.720 --> 48:01.640
where we raid this housing
project in the beginning,

48:01.720 --> 48:03.640
and there's this...

48:03.730 --> 48:06.650
There are a couple of families
in the apartments there

48:06.930 --> 48:10.350
who come in and we're throwing
them out of the housing project

48:10.430 --> 48:12.350
and various people are killed.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.860
The way some of them are
killed just make you go...

48:14.940 --> 48:16.860
Like that.

48:16.940 --> 48:19.360
And I saw some of the stuff
being shot, the scenes,

48:19.440 --> 48:21.860
but when he put it together
it was, uh...

48:21.940 --> 48:25.360
I was riveted to the seat.
I couldn't believe it.

48:25.450 --> 48:27.870
It was pretty powerful.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.870
Definitely not boring.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.040
On the couch...
Throw her on the couch.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
- Come on.
- Okay.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.090
It has been said that Romero

49:18.170 --> 49:20.590
doesn't allow us
to look at his shots,

49:20.670 --> 49:23.590
rather his cutting forces us
to experience them.

49:31.060 --> 49:33.730
This is as true of "Night"...

49:33.820 --> 49:35.740
No. No!

49:40.690 --> 49:42.110
No!

49:44.190 --> 49:46.860
As it is of "Martin"...

50:00.340 --> 50:02.260
As it is of "Dawn."

50:12.100 --> 50:15.640
Considering that quick cutting will
wear an audience down emotionally,

50:15.730 --> 50:17.170
it is remarkable
that he can maintain

50:17.230 --> 50:19.530
such a level of tension
in his films.

50:19.610 --> 50:23.030
They contain almost twice as many
cuts as any other directors'.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.410
He conceptualizes,
by doing takes,

50:25.480 --> 50:28.650
exactly what he needs,
and he's very efficient with his shots.

50:28.740 --> 50:30.540
Some call it choppy,
or some call it heavy-handed

50:30.620 --> 50:32.540
in terms of the editorial style.

50:46.420 --> 50:48.340
Hey, Dick!

50:49.430 --> 50:51.350
Hello.

50:55.930 --> 50:59.730
George's commercial background,
if you will,

50:59.820 --> 51:03.240
has set the tone
for his cutting,

51:03.320 --> 51:06.740
that he has a commercial reel
that I think is slick

51:06.830 --> 51:08.750
as anybody out of New York
or Los Angeles.

51:08.830 --> 51:12.750
Mellon bank and U.S. Steel
and Rockwell and Heinz...

51:12.830 --> 51:15.750
And he used to make very,
very slick 30-second commercials.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.260
And he learned the discipline

51:17.340 --> 51:20.260
whereby you have to say
something quickly, concisely

51:20.340 --> 51:21.760
and get the message across.

51:23.810 --> 51:26.220
What happens when
a Calgon research team

51:26.300 --> 51:28.350
and their submarine
are reduced to micro-size

51:28.430 --> 51:31.430
and sent on a dangerous mission
deep inside a washing machine?

51:34.520 --> 51:37.430
Engines reversed full, captain.
We're stuck.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.940
We've got to find out
what's on those fibers.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.450
Trapped in the fibers
of a giant t-shirt

51:42.530 --> 51:46.450
the Calgonauts discover secrets
of gray dull-looking laundry.

51:46.530 --> 51:50.060
- Why, it feels like...
- Leftover detergent film.

51:50.150 --> 51:52.780
The fibers are covered
with this stuff.

51:52.870 --> 51:55.290
This box has never been opened.

51:55.370 --> 51:58.040
Add the Calgon.
You'll thrill as Calgon

51:58.130 --> 52:00.800
dissolves the dirty
leftover detergent film.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.400
It's working.
The gray is gone.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.000
The fibers are clean.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.500
- Let's get out of here.
- I think I'm in love with you.

52:08.590 --> 52:10.890
If you're tired
of dull detergent films

52:10.970 --> 52:14.390
and grade-b washes,
thrill to the Calgon story.

52:14.480 --> 52:16.900
At your nearby
family washing machine.

52:16.980 --> 52:21.399
This has been transposed
into his feature editing,

52:21.400 --> 52:24.310
so that there is very rarely
a let up in the action.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.320
I don't think there
are very many shots

52:26.410 --> 52:28.330
that last four
or five seconds on screen.

52:28.410 --> 52:31.830
There are not thoselong, long
camera moves... That's true.

52:31.910 --> 52:33.820
Revolving around.
All George would do

52:33.910 --> 52:36.830
would cut them up
if Mike did them.

52:36.920 --> 52:40.340
I shoot a lot,

52:40.420 --> 52:43.840
because I know that I can
make the decisions later

52:43.920 --> 52:45.840
on the cutting table.

52:45.930 --> 52:48.850
So I wind up shooting
a lot of material that I fall in love with,

52:48.930 --> 52:51.850
and I really like.
And there's economically no room for it

52:51.930 --> 52:54.850
in the final piece.
So it's harder.

52:54.930 --> 52:56.850
And it's very hard...
When I sit down and I say

52:56.940 --> 52:58.860
"okay, here are 10 scenes
that I like,

52:58.940 --> 53:01.860
which two
are the least needed?"

53:01.940 --> 53:04.860
It's really...
That's a very difficult process for me.

53:04.940 --> 53:06.860
And I think that's where
all of your bias comes in...

53:06.950 --> 53:08.870
And all of your emotions.

53:08.950 --> 53:11.370
It's very difficult.
It's a lot easier to edit

53:11.450 --> 53:13.860
when you're upfront...
When you're writing it.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.880
There's a lot of people
that work with a formula

53:18.960 --> 53:22.380
in terms of when to use the master,
when to go in and all that.

53:22.460 --> 53:24.880
And people will say
that's very shattering

53:24.960 --> 53:26.880
if you don't follow
some kind of a pattern

53:26.970 --> 53:30.890
or if there isn't some kind
of an expected cutting pace

53:30.970 --> 53:32.890
that people can relax
and get comfortable with.

53:32.970 --> 53:34.890
I don't think
that's true at all.

53:34.970 --> 53:37.890
I don't think people notice cuts...
If they're well done.

53:37.980 --> 53:40.900
If they're not shattering or jarring,
you don't notice them at all.

53:40.980 --> 53:43.400
There's a sequence
in "Martin," for example,

53:43.480 --> 53:45.400
which could have been
just the murder sequence,

53:45.480 --> 53:48.780
but it's elongated as far as I
thought it could be elongated.

53:48.870 --> 53:52.290
- Emergency, now call 911.
- I can't call 911, that's the police...

53:52.380 --> 53:54.300
It's not, it's a general
emergency number!

53:56.380 --> 53:59.300
Some actions are mundane...
Dealing with the telephones.

53:59.380 --> 54:02.800
Call the hospital. Tell them what happened.
We'll be there in five minutes.

54:02.890 --> 54:05.390
All those actions,
no matter how mundane,

54:05.470 --> 54:07.880
become interesting when you look
at them in a certain way.

54:07.970 --> 54:11.390
- I don't know the number.
- Call information. Get the number... call them.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.350
They're all part of the overall
action that's going on.

54:14.430 --> 54:16.740
And they help to build
a certain amount of suspense,

54:16.820 --> 54:19.240
because they are things
that we deal with every day.

54:19.320 --> 54:22.610
Shit! It's fucked up.
Wait a minute.

54:22.690 --> 54:25.610
I gotta do it again.

54:25.690 --> 54:29.110
I can't get through.
I forgot the number.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.620
Wait...

54:34.200 --> 54:36.120
I don't like sloughing
sequences off.

54:36.200 --> 54:39.120
I don't like car chases
that don't do anything.

54:39.210 --> 54:42.630
Because within
a fight in this room

54:42.710 --> 54:45.130
that encompasses
three punches being thrown.

54:47.100 --> 54:49.020
Lewis!

54:49.100 --> 54:51.520
Move aside, you bastard...

54:51.600 --> 54:53.260
I'm not talking about
a big brawl.

54:53.350 --> 54:56.270
You could do
a three-punch fight

54:56.360 --> 54:58.280
and make it last five minutes.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.280
'Cause everything is valid
and everything is information.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.020
And I like to deal with detail.

55:08.620 --> 55:10.540
And I'd like to just
go with a visual,

55:10.620 --> 55:13.040
almost a cubist look at that.

55:13.120 --> 55:15.650
And that's another place
where I'll shoot a lot of film.

55:15.740 --> 55:18.160
Get away from me!
Stop!

55:24.250 --> 55:28.180
What did you do to me?

55:34.260 --> 55:36.680
I use a lot of sound elements.

55:36.760 --> 55:39.680
And I cut, rather thanon a flatbed,
on a table with a synchronizer.

55:39.770 --> 55:42.190
And there's a certain
kind of tactile thing

55:42.270 --> 55:44.070
that I get into
in terms of the tracks.

55:44.150 --> 55:48.070
It's a visual almost
checker-boarding of the tracks.

55:48.160 --> 55:51.080
I don't use film as leader.
I always use white,

55:51.160 --> 55:53.080
because I like to see

55:53.160 --> 55:55.580
that white-brown juxtaposition
of the tracks.

55:55.660 --> 55:57.830
I like to lay the tracks
across on a table.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.840
You can almost visualize
how the track is working.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.840
And I use a lot of track.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.840
And when I do my first cut,
I don't just cut picture-voice.

56:05.930 --> 56:08.850
I cut with some kind of music

56:08.930 --> 56:11.850
and with effects...

56:11.930 --> 56:14.850
You use pre-recorded music
to get the rhythms?

56:14.930 --> 56:16.850
Yeah, to get some kind
of rhythm going...

56:16.940 --> 56:18.860
Until I find a rhythm going.

56:18.940 --> 56:20.860
And I wind up
with a lot of tracks

56:20.940 --> 56:22.860
for a small independent.

56:22.940 --> 56:26.360
I've seen studio productions where
they get into 30-40 tracks,

56:26.450 --> 56:30.370
but that's just because they're
too lazy to lay them in sometimes.

56:30.450 --> 56:34.370
I use 12-15 tracks.

56:34.450 --> 56:38.370
And I like a lot of sound.
I hate dead air.

56:38.460 --> 56:40.380
I'll always use
some kind of an ambiance

56:40.460 --> 56:43.380
and a lot of music,

56:43.460 --> 56:45.380
which is just all form stuff.

56:45.460 --> 56:48.380
Some people say that my tracks
are too driving

56:48.470 --> 56:50.390
or too full,

56:50.470 --> 56:53.890
but that's just
personal preference.

57:03.100 --> 57:05.520
In summary,
this sequence from "Dawn"

57:05.600 --> 57:09.020
clearly demonstrates
Romero's style,

57:09.100 --> 57:11.650
conceptualized
in the screenplay stage...

57:13.740 --> 57:16.160
Given substance
during shooting...

57:18.750 --> 57:20.170
And given shape in the editing.

57:44.820 --> 57:46.690
We don't make
distributions arrangements

57:46.780 --> 57:49.200
till after we finish a picture.

57:49.280 --> 57:52.200
Not wanting to have too many
fingers in the pie too soon,

57:52.280 --> 57:56.200
not wanting to compromise
from ground zero.

57:56.290 --> 57:59.710
Eventually we may have to make some
compromises on a business level,

57:59.790 --> 58:01.710
but at least they start later.

58:01.790 --> 58:05.210
And we've finished the picture so it's
a matterof maybe taking something out.

58:05.290 --> 58:07.710
This statement was made
during production

58:07.800 --> 58:11.720
and carried with it an ominous note which
reverberated for over a year

58:11.800 --> 58:15.220
as Romero fought for
a strong vision.

58:15.300 --> 58:18.970
It stood as a thorn in the side
of negotiations with distributors

58:19.060 --> 58:22.480
even after "Dawn" opened to
tremendous business in Europe.

58:22.560 --> 58:25.340
Finally a breakthrough
was achieved.

58:25.430 --> 58:27.790
We made a couple of errors
in signing the distribution deal

58:27.880 --> 58:30.300
with "Night of the Living Dead"

58:30.390 --> 58:34.310
in that we sold, or we'd signed
a distribution deal worldwide.

58:34.390 --> 58:37.810
We didn't hold out any rights...
television, Canada, Europe... nothing.

58:37.890 --> 58:42.310
16mm... nothing.
We gave the distributor the world.

58:42.400 --> 58:45.070
Basically, I didn't
know anything then...

58:45.150 --> 58:48.570
About the business side of things and
about how to draw a contract.

58:48.650 --> 58:52.070
Now, knowing what I know now,

58:52.160 --> 58:54.580
you want to ask for as many
of those controls

58:54.660 --> 58:56.970
as you can possibly
get your hands on.

58:57.050 --> 58:58.970
When you have a smash-hit film
out in theaters,

58:59.050 --> 59:00.970
your 16mm rights
are going to be worth a lot.

59:01.050 --> 59:03.220
Television rights
will be worth a lot.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.720
So principally
I would say that...

59:05.810 --> 59:07.730
Hold for as much as you
can hold out for.

59:07.810 --> 59:11.680
There were a number of people that
offered us substantial amounts of money

59:11.760 --> 59:14.170
to deliver an R-rated film
which meant,

59:14.260 --> 59:17.180
we anticipated, cutting
the guts out of the movie...

59:17.270 --> 59:19.190
In order to get that "R."

59:19.270 --> 59:23.190
We looked for a distributor
who recognized, as we did,

59:23.270 --> 59:25.190
that the best economic
course of action

59:25.270 --> 59:27.190
was to leave the film untampered

59:27.280 --> 59:29.200
even though that created
other problems.

59:29.280 --> 59:30.700
It created the potential problem

59:30.780 --> 59:32.700
of a newspaper
not taking the ad.

59:32.780 --> 59:34.700
It created the problem

59:34.780 --> 59:38.200
of a TV station
not running a commercial,

59:38.290 --> 59:41.210
a certain theater
not playing the film.

59:41.290 --> 59:45.710
We believed that ultimately economically
those problems would cost less

59:45.800 --> 59:50.220
and we would make more if the film
was left as George wanted it.

59:50.300 --> 59:52.720
Several of the distributors
that wanted it badly

59:52.800 --> 59:56.720
understanding the problems... For example
with the MPAA, here in this country...

59:56.810 --> 01:00:00.230
That the mpaa would
probably "X" the film.

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:02.730
And the only way to get an "R"
would be to cut it.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.730
So I wound up holding out
during the negotiations

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.740
and luckily Richard backed me
up all the way on this,

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.240
because there were a couple of times
when it would have been easier

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:16.240
to take a deal... Would have
been financially easier to take a deal.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:20.250
That's the other thing... I think that
Richard and I have had a good relationship.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:23.750
So I don't have to worry
about my own internal team.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:28.250
And that's big...
Number one.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.260
Having Richard's support,
I was just able to sit there

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.750
and say "look, I'm not gonna
cut the picture."

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.840
When the distributor took his stance
to put the picture out unrated,

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.850
it's not that he wasn't
accepting the restrictions of an "X"...

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.730
Because he's putting
a flag on it that says

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:45.240
no one under 17 will be admitted.
Forget with a parent,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.740
not at all...
And he's accepting those restrictions.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.740
What he's not accepting
is the symbol itself, the "X,"

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.750
because the "X"
does automatically

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:56.750
say to most people in America
that this picture is obscene.

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:59.250
For a major company
in the industry

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.760
to release a film without a rating
is a major break.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.760
And that was something
that was long and hard in finding.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.090
We basically are in agreement
with a system which flags movies

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.600
and tells people
what they're gonna see.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.440
Our point is, there should not be
economic penalties attached to that.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.440
I also had to fight... You always
have to fight for things like length.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.440
Usually with an exploitation picture,
a distributor will say

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.940
"It's terrific and I love it,
but cut it to 90 minutes."

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.450
Once again, there's no secret.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.450
I can't teach you how to get

01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:31.440
the kind of controls that enable you
to leave your picture longer...

01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:34.950
Or to have that kind of creative cut.
It's a matter of holding out for it

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.460
and not selling until
somebody gives it to you.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:41.460
And I was able to do that
partially because of my reputation,

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.460
but partially just because
I sat there and said no.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.970
And there were a couple
of sticky times

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.970
when people would get up from the
negotiating table and walk and go home.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.970
You got to sit through them,
those are the toughest times.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.230
You gotta sit through that and say
"okay, see you tomorrow"... hopefully.

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:59.230
And we did see them tomorrow
and they ultimately

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:01.530
said "okay, it can be your cut."

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:04.798
Adam, let me give you something
you might want to use.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.238
- Okay, keep it going.
- Just roll for a second.

01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:10.618
I think that there
are very few directors

01:02:10.698 --> 01:02:14.118
that have total, final,
real last cut on their movies.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:18.248
I say that when they tell you that
these are the rules for the system

01:02:18.338 --> 01:02:20.258
and you can't do it another way,

01:02:20.338 --> 01:02:23.258
they're not correct.
It can be done other ways.

01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:25.258
You can maintain control
of your product.

01:02:25.348 --> 01:02:28.268
I'm not saying it's easy,
but it can be done.

01:02:28.348 --> 01:02:30.268
You don't have to be
in New York or Hollywood

01:02:30.348 --> 01:02:33.768
in order to produce films,
to get attention.

01:02:33.848 --> 01:02:35.768
I think we're the proof of that.

01:02:35.858 --> 01:02:38.278
I would be
as encouraging as possible

01:02:38.358 --> 01:02:40.778
to people to do
what everybody else

01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:43.778
says you can't do.

01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:36.172
So, "Night of the Living Dead"
is the beginning

01:05:36.262 --> 01:05:38.182
and this is the end?

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.150
- This is the middle.
- This is the middle?

01:05:40.272 --> 01:05:43.092
- Is there room for more?
- There's plenty of room for more.

01:05:43.193 --> 01:05:45.203
Zombies are still dumb.
