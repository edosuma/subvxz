WEBVTT

01:46.166 --> 01:48.567
- Some big high roller
once said,

01:48.633 --> 01:51.567
"The business of America
is business."

01:51.633 --> 01:53.033
And I'm happy to report,

01:53.100 --> 01:55.700
the criminal justice
business is booming.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.767
With heavy industry
headed south,

01:57.834 --> 02:00.400
small towns are battling
for state contracts

02:00.467 --> 02:03.033
to build
correctional facilities.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.133
Who'd have thunk it?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.734
Nice, upstanding citizens

02:06.800 --> 02:09.233
begging to have rapists,
drug dealers and murderers

02:09.300 --> 02:11.667
right in their
own backyard.

02:11.734 --> 02:13.100
- How's your brother?

02:13.166 --> 02:15.300
- The doctor said he's fully
recovered from the overdose.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.400
They're gonna keep him
in the hospital overnight

02:17.467 --> 02:20.033
for observation,
but Cyril's gonna be fine.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.266
- Praise, Allah.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.734
- Hey, O'Reilly.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.333
Sorry to hear about
your girlfriend.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.600
- Who's his girlfriend,
Adebisi?

02:30.667 --> 02:32.667
- Dr. Nathan.

02:32.734 --> 02:34.233
Yeah, she took
a leave of absence.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.867
Apparently, she almost
choked to death

02:35.934 --> 02:37.734
when our boy Ryan, here,
came in her mouth.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.867
- Fuck you!

02:44.300 --> 02:46.166
Bring it on!

02:46.233 --> 02:48.166
- Fuck you!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.000
- What the fuck are
you cuffing me for?

02:54.066 --> 02:55.333
I didn't start shit!

02:55.400 --> 02:56.667
- Shut your fucking face,
O'Reilly!

02:56.734 --> 02:58.900
- Eat me,
you goddamned clit!

03:02.467 --> 03:03.834
- I'll take this one.

03:05.567 --> 03:06.900
- Fuck you!

03:10.333 --> 03:13.567
Are you crazy?
Goddamn it, fuck!

03:15.533 --> 03:18.400
- Just stay down,
stay the fuck down!

03:24.100 --> 03:26.133
- Blow me.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.200
- Again?
- Yeah.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.734
Oh, fuck.

03:48.567 --> 03:50.367
- Rabbi.

03:51.467 --> 03:55.066
So, feeling better?

03:55.133 --> 03:57.800
- A dead man needs
to cover all his options.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.633
- You sure
you're a dead man?

03:59.700 --> 04:00.967
- Mr. Querns,

04:01.033 --> 04:04.734
sometime after you send me
back to Em City,

04:04.800 --> 04:07.633
a day, a week, maybe,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.200
O'Reilly will have
found a way to kill me.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.800
- I like you,
Stanislofsky.

04:13.867 --> 04:17.000
I don't know why,
but I do.

04:17.066 --> 04:19.433
I can let you stay up here
for a few more days.

04:19.500 --> 04:22.600
- What good is going
to come of that?

04:22.667 --> 04:24.367
Death is inevitable.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.500
- Not necessarily.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.166
I plan to have a little talk
with your old pal,

04:29.233 --> 04:30.767
Ryan O'Reilly.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.066
- You know,

04:43.133 --> 04:45.567
I'm trying to
eliminate violence from Em City.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.500
- And doing an
amazing job, sir.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.433
- Cut the crap!

04:49.500 --> 04:51.000
When Stanislofsky returns,

04:51.066 --> 04:53.533
if anything happens to him,
I mean, anything--

04:53.600 --> 04:55.033
he cuts himself shaving,

04:55.100 --> 04:56.567
I'm holding
you responsible.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.767
- Hoyt's got the hots
for Stanislofsky, not me.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.900
- I don't care,
you're responsible.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.300
Understand?

05:02.367 --> 05:03.734
- Uh-huh.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.767
If Nikolai gets hurt when
he gets back to Em City,

05:05.834 --> 05:07.400
my ass is grass.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.900
- Right, now get lost.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.100
- Claire?
- Yeah?

05:19.166 --> 05:20.667
- Baby?
- Yeah?

05:20.734 --> 05:22.066
- Hey, how much
do you love me?

05:22.133 --> 05:23.467
- Oh, plenty.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.533
- Yeah?
Enough to do anything I ask?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.133
- Yeah.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.500
- That a girl.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.567
- Cyril, hey!

05:41.633 --> 05:43.734
How you doin', huh?

05:43.800 --> 05:45.867
You okay?
You feeling better?

05:45.934 --> 05:47.066
- Yes.
- Good.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.700
- O'Reilly?
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.433
- That certain someone
you asked me to inquire about?

05:51.500 --> 05:52.567
- Yeah.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.467
- He's coming back
to Em City tomorrow.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.667
- Stay right there.

05:56.734 --> 05:58.300
Shit.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.567
- Ready for this?

05:59.633 --> 06:00.834
He asked Querns
for a favor.

06:00.900 --> 06:01.900
- What?

06:01.967 --> 06:03.266
- He wants
to take a bath.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.100
- There's no
bathtubs in Oz.

06:05.166 --> 06:07.934
- Hospital therapy room.

06:08.033 --> 06:10.166
That's perfect.

06:10.233 --> 06:11.834
You know what to do,
right?

06:23.066 --> 06:25.266
- I'm here to pick up
Stanislofsky.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.734
Thanks.

06:34.066 --> 06:35.600
You almost done?

06:35.667 --> 06:39.600
- Five minutes, please.
I'm enjoying myself.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.800
- I'll bet I can help you
enjoy yourself even more.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.500
- Ah, that's good.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.967
- How's that?

07:01.033 --> 07:03.200
- It was never
like this in Gulag.

07:03.266 --> 07:05.066
- You men are all alike.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.467
So quick,
so easily satisfied.

07:08.533 --> 07:11.433
Most of you don't know dick
about making a woman happy.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.834
- Ryan O'Reilly does.
- Oh, really?

07:17.133 --> 07:19.500
- Here's a small token
of his affection.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.467
- What is this?

07:23.533 --> 07:25.133
- A rubber duckie.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.533
- Rubber duckie?

07:43.100 --> 07:46.033
- Call the medic; I think
the Russian guy's dead.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.667
- Hey, Mr. Querns.

07:54.734 --> 07:56.166
I heard about Stanislofsky.

07:56.233 --> 07:57.500
That's weird.

07:57.567 --> 08:00.000
A guy dies before
he gets back to Em City?

08:00.066 --> 08:01.967
Yeah.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.567
- Picasso, bend over.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.867
- Hey, Miles,
special delivery.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.500
- Paints,
thank fucking Christ,

08:29.567 --> 08:30.834
I'm almost out.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.934
- It's coming
along real nice.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.700
- Nice?

08:33.767 --> 08:35.266
This is a masterpiece
of 21st century art.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.100
This wall should
be in the Louvre.

08:42.300 --> 08:43.433
- Hey, Schillinger!

08:43.500 --> 08:44.600
Next time try
handin' them to me.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.200
- Fuck you.

08:46.266 --> 08:47.800
- Lunch!

08:47.867 --> 08:49.233
- Hey, what you
got, Leroy?

08:49.300 --> 08:51.467
- Chicken nuggets.
- Again?

08:51.533 --> 08:53.367
Don't you niggers know how to
shake 'n bake anything else?

08:53.433 --> 08:56.400
- Yo, we've got state dietary
guidelines to follow, dog.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.900
- Careful!
You spilled my nuggets!

09:03.967 --> 09:05.266
- Fuck you.

09:12.567 --> 09:13.767
- Time to go, Deyell.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.000
- Go?
Where's he goin'?

09:16.066 --> 09:17.266
- Meeting with his lawyer.

09:18.734 --> 09:21.500
- You still tryin' to appeal
your death sentence, black boy?

09:21.567 --> 09:22.867
- Fuck you, bitch!

09:22.934 --> 09:24.767
- Hell, man, they ain't
never gonna let you off.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.200
- No one's asking
your opinion, asshole.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.367
- Yeah, Miles,
give your mouth a rest, okay?

09:46.266 --> 09:48.333
- Judge Fee has
denied our appeal.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.266
- Shit.

09:50.333 --> 09:53.700
Shit, shit, shit!

09:53.767 --> 09:55.300
- Is there a problem?

09:55.367 --> 09:57.433
- He's fine, officer.
We're fine.

10:02.467 --> 10:03.633
- So, what's next?

10:03.700 --> 10:05.800
- We go to
the State Supreme Court

10:05.867 --> 10:08.767
and appeal the appellate
court's decision.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.166
- How long is
that gonna take?

10:10.233 --> 10:12.300
- Given the court's
current caseload,

10:12.367 --> 10:13.300
I'd say
at least a year.

10:13.367 --> 10:14.633
- A year?

10:14.700 --> 10:16.500
Dawn, I can't sit up
on death row another day,

10:16.567 --> 10:17.867
much less a fucking year!

10:17.934 --> 10:19.767
- I didn't create
the system, Moses.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.033
I just wallow in it.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.166
- Can't you drop some
speed on the process?

10:25.233 --> 10:27.767
- I don't even know if
they're going to hear our case.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.000
Chief Justice Ginther,

10:29.066 --> 10:30.600
who was appointed
by James Devlin,

10:30.667 --> 10:31.867
tends to turn a deaf ear

10:31.934 --> 10:35.133
to anything he considers
soft on crime.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.600
- So, what you're saying
is I'm fucked?

10:37.667 --> 10:41.033
- What I'm saying is
time may be on our side.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.767
Rumor is Ginther's
got prostate cancer.

10:43.834 --> 10:46.066
He dies, retires,

10:46.133 --> 10:48.333
a new chief might look at
the death penalty differently.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.834
- And meanwhile?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.233
- Meanwhile, you're alive
for at least another year.

10:52.300 --> 10:55.133
Make the best
of a bad situation.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.633
- Hey, Deyell,

10:58.700 --> 11:01.200
you know how I'm always
calling you "black boy"?

11:01.266 --> 11:03.567
Well, while you were downstairs
with your legal beagle,

11:03.633 --> 11:06.367
I thought, "Shit,
there's a whole bunch

11:06.433 --> 11:08.500
of other names
I can use."

11:08.567 --> 11:09.800
"Nigger,"
of course.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.900
Or "coon,"

11:11.967 --> 11:13.200
"jigaboo,"

11:13.266 --> 11:15.100
"spear chucker,"

11:15.166 --> 11:16.834
"schwatza,"

11:16.900 --> 11:18.700
"mulonian."

11:18.767 --> 11:21.367
But I settled
on "Negro."

11:21.433 --> 11:23.934
Neeee-gro!

11:24.000 --> 11:27.166
It's got a kind of simplicity.

11:27.233 --> 11:30.500
Negro is the Spanish
word for blacks, a Negro.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.500
Negro.//

11:32.567 --> 11:33.934
Negro.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.567
Negro, Negro, Negro,
Negro, Negro, Negro!

11:45.567 --> 11:48.700
- Idiot, move out
of the way, idiot!

11:48.767 --> 11:50.767
It goes like this, faster!

11:50.834 --> 11:53.500
See this?
Now, move!

12:07.700 --> 12:09.633
- Crybaby.

12:09.700 --> 12:15.133
- Prisoner number
96Z858, Eli Zabitz.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.066
Convicted
April 1st, 1996.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.900
Aggravated assault.

12:19.967 --> 12:22.633
Sentence: nine years.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.767
Up for parole in six.

12:33.166 --> 12:34.900
- Zabitz.
- Oh, Keller.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.700
- Where you going?
- I gotta be somewhere.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.200
- No, you gotta be
right here with me.

12:38.266 --> 12:40.333
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.800
- How are your
daughter's teeth?

12:41.867 --> 12:45.433
- Oh, I'm proud to say
every one is now a pearl.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.533
- I'm glad.

12:46.600 --> 12:47.667
That makes me happy
that you're able

12:47.734 --> 12:49.333
to provide dental care
before you die.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.467
- Die, I'm not...
Jesus, Keller!

12:51.533 --> 12:53.467
- Why don't you just sit down
and shut the fuck up?

12:53.533 --> 12:56.200
Now...

12:56.266 --> 12:59.333
You told Tobias Beecher
that I killed his kid.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.033
- Yeah, but Schillinger
made me do it.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.600
- Shh, shh, shh.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.500
Regardless.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.734
Soon, you're gonna be
joining your ancestors.

13:10.800 --> 13:15.133
- If you're gonna do it,
why tell me?

13:15.200 --> 13:17.467
- So, you can get your
affairs in order

13:17.533 --> 13:19.400
and to watch you sweat.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.600
- Are listening to me?

13:28.667 --> 13:31.300
Keller says
he's gonna whack me.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.767
- Will you get off my back?

13:32.834 --> 13:35.200
You're ruining
my concentration.

13:35.266 --> 13:37.467
- Listen, you gotta
protect me.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.033
Because if you
don't protect me,

13:39.100 --> 13:40.533
I'm goin' to the hacks

13:40.600 --> 13:42.400
and I'm gonna tell them
you paid me

13:42.467 --> 13:43.834
to lie to Beecher.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.934
- Lower your voice.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.867
You see what
you made me do?

13:50.934 --> 13:52.300
You're fucking up
my game here.

13:52.367 --> 13:53.667
- Your game, huh?

13:53.734 --> 13:55.900
This is my life
we're talking about!

13:55.967 --> 13:57.567
Look, I said I'd protect you
from Keller.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.467
I'll protect you, okay?

13:59.533 --> 14:01.200
-  Okay.

14:01.266 --> 14:03.033
- Now, buzz off.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.200
- Jesus.

14:08.266 --> 14:10.934
I thought the Jews were
supposed to be tough.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.133
- Hmm, that's just
the Israelis.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.834
- Kill him.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.100
I'm gonna take
that shot again.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.333
- Hello, Eli.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.667
You know, this room
really isn't that safe.

14:32.734 --> 14:35.100
I got stabbed here
once myself.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.633
- Fuck, Keller, no!

14:38.900 --> 14:40.867
Oh, thank God.

14:40.934 --> 14:42.767
Get him.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.533
- Schillinger
wants you dead.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.734
- What? Fuck!

14:47.800 --> 14:49.433
- Robson, this is my kill.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.934
- Take a fucking
walk, Keller.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.266
- Please, please,
don't kill me!

14:53.333 --> 14:54.867
Please!

15:13.967 --> 15:15.100
- Later.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.200
- Later.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.433
- He dead?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.400
- Heart attack.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.500
-  Jesus.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.100
I told him you gotta
watch that red meat.

15:56.934 --> 15:58.033
- Beecher!

16:09.500 --> 16:12.033
- I'll see ya.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.367
- You know, you used to
be addicted to alcohol,

16:29.433 --> 16:30.667
then heroin.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.667
But this obsession,

16:32.734 --> 16:35.200
that's the worst,

16:35.266 --> 16:37.500
and the most dangerous.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.500
Hey, I'm talking to you.

16:44.567 --> 16:47.133
- Oh, I like it
when you're rough.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.233
- You're a slut, Beecher.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.333
You'll sleep with anyone.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.900
So?

16:55.967 --> 16:57.233
- So, how does that sex
make you feel?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.300
You feel better
about yourself?

16:59.367 --> 17:01.066
- No, worse.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.500
- Then, why do it?

17:03.567 --> 17:06.367
- Because at least
I'm feeling something.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.767
I prefer to be happy,

17:08.834 --> 17:11.567
but self-hate'll
do in a pinch.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.367
- Don't hate yourself.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.934
- Why not?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.767
My son is dead
'cause of me.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.934
My daughter's a mess
'cause of me.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.800
And Keller...

17:27.867 --> 17:30.200
Keller doesn't love me.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.333
But I tried
this new detergent.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.767
It really seems to
get the whites clean.

17:52.967 --> 17:55.166
- Hello, Chris.
I'm here about Beecher.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.900
- I get a half-hour
in the gym.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.200
You're eating into my time.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.834
- Will you just
hear me out, please?

18:02.233 --> 18:04.300
The man is
dying inside.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.166
- Well, that's
not on me.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.000
- I'm not blaming you.

18:08.066 --> 18:10.533
I'm asking you for your
help to turn him around.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.100
The two of you
had a relationship.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.667
You had
an intimate relationship.

18:16.734 --> 18:20.300
- Oh, come on, Father,
you can say it.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.467
We fucked each
other up the ass,

18:22.533 --> 18:23.800
in the mouth.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.433
- No, no,
not the fucking, the love.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.066
The two of you
loved each other.

18:27.133 --> 18:29.166
Now, I know that
is all over now.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.266
But still, if you had
any real feelings for him,

18:31.333 --> 18:32.500
I can't believe
that you would sit by

18:32.567 --> 18:34.300
and watch
what's happening.

18:34.367 --> 18:35.734
- He tried to kill me.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.300
- Ahh!
You murdered my son!

18:38.367 --> 18:40.200
- And my relationship
with Beecher,

18:40.266 --> 18:44.033
it started in brutality
and that's where it's ended.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.166
Love was
the smallest part.

18:46.233 --> 18:48.600
- I don't really believe
that you believe that.

18:50.867 --> 18:51.934
- You don't?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.600
Where do you live,
Father?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.500
Where do you live?

18:58.567 --> 19:00.367
- In a rectory
at St. Margaret's.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.200
- A rectory, only men
live there, right?

19:02.266 --> 19:03.500
- Yeah.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.233
- You share common
experiences,

19:05.300 --> 19:06.834
a common belief.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.900
You accept each other's
eccentricities, flaws.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.567
Some flaws are
unacceptable,

19:12.633 --> 19:16.033
like, say, one priest
wants to fuck another.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.066
- Oh, Keller!
- You said, "Hear me out."

19:19.133 --> 19:22.900
I mean, I'm just asking
for the same courtesy.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.467
- Okay.

19:25.533 --> 19:28.533
- Unless, of course,
I'm hitting too close to home.

19:30.433 --> 19:31.800
You never have,
have you?

19:31.867 --> 19:33.066
- What?

19:33.133 --> 19:34.967
- Fucked a fellow priest.

19:35.033 --> 19:36.400
- No.

19:38.033 --> 19:39.000
- Ever wanted to?

19:39.066 --> 19:40.533
- No.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.533
- Oh, come on, you share
a bathroom together.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.900
You walk in
and some seminarian's

19:43.967 --> 19:45.400
tight little ass
is hanging out.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.467
- Keller, I see
what you're up to.

19:47.533 --> 19:49.700
- You want me to do
the honorable thing,

19:49.767 --> 19:51.400
the selfless thing.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.233
Say, "I'll help Beecher out."

19:53.300 --> 19:55.500
Hey, Mukada,

19:55.567 --> 19:58.200
we're in Oz.

19:58.266 --> 20:00.333
And like I said,
other rules apply.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.867
Now according to
the code we got here,

20:01.934 --> 20:04.400
I'm not expected
to save Beecher.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.867
Fuck, I'd be breaking
that code if I did.

20:06.934 --> 20:11.667
- It only takes one man
to change the way things are.

20:11.734 --> 20:13.667
- Yeah?

20:15.300 --> 20:17.400
Well, I'm
not that man.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.500
- Seven out of 10 inmates
are from cities,

20:25.567 --> 20:27.800
but 90% of the prisons
themselves

20:27.867 --> 20:29.667
are in rural areas.

20:29.734 --> 20:33.300
You know, farmland,
hillsides, forests.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.834
Now, you'd think such
bucolic surroundings

20:35.900 --> 20:39.333
would have a calming effect
on those inside.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.300
But no.

20:41.367 --> 20:43.367
Out in the wild,

20:43.433 --> 20:44.900
things only get wilder.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.533
- Tobias,
we have bad news.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.633
- Bad news?
Gee, that's a change.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.800
- Hank Schillinger got off
on the murdering

21:00.867 --> 21:02.333
and the kidnapping charges.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.066
- What?

21:04.133 --> 21:05.600
You mean he's free?

21:05.667 --> 21:07.767
- Yes.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.400
Evidently, when
the arrest was made,

21:09.467 --> 21:11.467
the police didn't do something
they were supposed to do

21:11.533 --> 21:13.433
and the judge just
let Hank go free.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.333
- On a technicality?

21:15.400 --> 21:16.900
- Yeah.

21:16.967 --> 21:19.367
- What happens next?

21:19.433 --> 21:21.033
- Nothing.

21:21.100 --> 21:23.500
There's nothing
that can be done.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.700
- Okay.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.567
- Tobias, aren't you
going to stay

21:27.633 --> 21:28.867
and talk about this?

21:28.934 --> 21:31.166
- If there's
nothing to be done,

21:31.233 --> 21:33.133
what is there
to talk about?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.467
- Your anger.

21:34.533 --> 21:37.000
- Sister, you do not
want to see my anger.

21:37.066 --> 21:39.266
My anger is massive,
all-encompassing.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.266
- I'm not afraid.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.033
-  Fine.

21:47.934 --> 21:50.100
Where the fuck have you been
during all this shit?

21:50.166 --> 21:51.734
- Tobias.
- What?

21:51.800 --> 21:54.100
- Let him talk!

21:54.166 --> 21:55.633
- I thought you
actually cared,

21:55.700 --> 21:57.066
but only if it
doesn't get in the way

21:57.133 --> 21:59.467
of your own
fucking bullshit.

21:59.533 --> 22:02.333
You are nothing
but a selfish cunt.

22:07.734 --> 22:09.333
Now can I go?

22:09.400 --> 22:11.233
- Yes, but think
about something.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.867
There's only one person
who really matters

22:13.934 --> 22:15.667
in all of this and
it's your daughter, Holly.

22:15.734 --> 22:17.433
Holly needs your strength!

22:17.500 --> 22:20.100
She needs her father!

22:24.767 --> 22:26.200
- What is your name?

22:29.033 --> 22:32.934
- Hank?
- Yo, Dad.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
- "Yo"?
What kind of talk is that?

22:36.066 --> 22:38.467
- I was shittin'
in my pants.

22:38.533 --> 22:39.767
I thought the Feds
had me by the balls.

22:39.834 --> 22:42.233
- They can't touch you, son.

22:44.467 --> 22:46.600
- Do you have
any more cash?

22:46.667 --> 22:48.400
I was thinking
of going to Miami.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.567
- Leaving town?

22:49.633 --> 22:52.200
- For a while.

22:52.266 --> 22:54.900
- I was hoping we'd get to
spend some time together.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.433
- Well, yeah, yeah,
when I come back,

22:57.500 --> 22:59.633
we'll do the
father-son thing.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.000
So what do you say?

23:01.066 --> 23:02.934
Can you give me
some more money?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.600
- Sure, anything you need.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.700
- Cool, cool.

23:09.467 --> 23:10.934
- I've arranged
with the warden

23:11.000 --> 23:13.200
for you to have regular
visits with your daughter.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.800
We spoke to
your parents,

23:14.867 --> 23:18.133
and they've agreed to bring
Holly here three times a week.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.734
Twice after school
and Saturdays.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.066
You and she need
the time together.

23:24.133 --> 23:25.900
You need time to heal.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.967
- Mail.

23:35.633 --> 23:36.934
- Stop them!

23:38.900 --> 23:40.500
- I'm gonna kill you,
motherfucker!

23:42.500 --> 23:43.967
- Well, I guess you heard
the good news about Hank.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.100
- Oh, stop that!

23:45.166 --> 23:47.467
- Cocksucker!
You fucking cocksucker!

23:47.533 --> 23:49.300
- Take him to Em City!

23:49.367 --> 23:52.333
- You wait!
You fucking wait!

23:55.266 --> 23:58.700
- Wow-wee, got quite
a temper, hasn't he?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.633
- Oh, what do you want?

24:11.700 --> 24:14.333
- I'd like to have
a chat with Mr. Pancamo.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.734
- A chat?

24:15.800 --> 24:18.533
Let me see if he's
in a chatting mood.

24:24.133 --> 24:25.400
- Nice shirt.

24:28.867 --> 24:30.367
- You can go in.

24:32.300 --> 24:35.100
- Mr. Pancamo,
thank you for seeing me.

24:35.166 --> 24:37.266
- I have to admit,
I'm intrigued.

24:37.333 --> 24:40.500
You and me ain't
exactly paisans.

24:40.567 --> 24:43.133
- I need you to
arrange something.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.633
- Drugs?

24:44.700 --> 24:46.233
- No.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.767
Two of my children
were kidnapped.

24:48.834 --> 24:50.867
My son, Gary, was killed.

24:50.934 --> 24:52.300
- Yeah, I heard.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.100
Schillinger's son,
Hank, did it,

24:54.166 --> 24:56.100
but the bastard got off
on a legal technicality.

24:56.166 --> 24:57.800
- That sucks.

24:57.867 --> 25:00.333
- He's out free,

25:00.400 --> 25:02.700
while my son lies
rotting in the ground.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.133
I want Hank Schillinger dead.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.767
- Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

25:10.834 --> 25:13.033
Are you asking me
to set up the hit?

25:13.100 --> 25:14.233
- Yes.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.600
- Well, how do I know

25:15.667 --> 25:18.667
this isn't some kind
of a sting operation?

25:18.734 --> 25:23.066
You working with the hacks
to fuck me over?

25:23.133 --> 25:25.133
- The only proof
I have is this.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.266
While you're
taking care of Hank,

25:28.333 --> 25:30.133
I'm gonna
kill his father.

25:35.633 --> 25:38.934
- Okay, you got a deal.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.200
A thousand for me,
a thousand for the job.

25:42.266 --> 25:43.200
Cash.

25:43.266 --> 25:44.700
- Okay.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.233
- Hey.

26:05.266 --> 26:07.300
You gonna see
your daughter?

26:07.367 --> 26:08.867
- Yup.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.033
The first time
since the kidnapping.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.066
- That'll be good for her.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.934
And for you.

26:20.266 --> 26:22.533
- Listen, I saw you
talking with Pancamo.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.900
- You saw me with Pancamo?
- Yeah.

26:25.967 --> 26:27.600
It doesn't take
a Rhodes Scholar to figure out

26:27.667 --> 26:29.033
what's in play.

26:32.066 --> 26:33.567
You're gonna have
Hank Schillinger killed,

26:33.633 --> 26:34.667
aren't you?

26:36.667 --> 26:40.033
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna deny it?

26:45.800 --> 26:48.133
You know,
you killed Andrew,

26:48.200 --> 26:49.467
Schillinger's son.

26:49.533 --> 26:50.900
He killed Gary,
your son.

26:50.967 --> 26:53.066
Now you wanna
kill Hank?

26:53.133 --> 26:55.633
Beecher, when is all this
madness going to end?

26:56.734 --> 26:58.500
- After I kill
Schillinger.

26:58.567 --> 27:01.200
- And then you will
end up on death row.

27:01.266 --> 27:02.867
And what good
are you gonna be

27:02.934 --> 27:04.200
to your daughter then?

27:04.266 --> 27:06.934
- What good am I to her now?

27:20.300 --> 27:21.667
Holly?

27:27.934 --> 27:30.834
Oh, baby,
how are you doing?

27:30.900 --> 27:34.467
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.200
Let me look at you.

27:39.266 --> 27:42.166
My beautiful girl.

28:09.867 --> 28:12.100
I love my daughter.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.133
- I know you do.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.800
- I only want
the best for her.

28:14.867 --> 28:15.800
- Of course.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.567
She shouldn't
have to carry

28:22.633 --> 28:24.200
the weight of my mistakes.

28:35.567 --> 28:37.433
Excuse me,
Mr. Pancamo?

28:37.500 --> 28:39.000
- Hey, Beecher.

28:39.066 --> 28:40.567
Thanks for
the prompt payment.

28:40.633 --> 28:42.266
I wish others
lived by your example.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.500
- Look, I have
thought it over

28:44.567 --> 28:45.800
and I've changed
my mind.

28:45.867 --> 28:48.567
I wanna call off
the hit on Hank Schillinger.

28:48.633 --> 28:50.333
- That's fine.

28:51.734 --> 28:53.433
Except for
one little thing.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.533
You're too late.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.734
- He's dead?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
- Bullet right
through the brain.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.600
- Oh, shit.
- But don't worry.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.900
They're never gonna
find the body,

29:03.967 --> 29:06.100
never in a million years.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.967
Hank Schillinger
has simply disappeared.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.266
- Time to go home, Rebadow.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.867
- Since I took
over this unit,

29:29.934 --> 29:32.934
violence has
decreased by 92%.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.967
92%!

29:35.033 --> 29:36.700
That statistic
would be higher

29:36.767 --> 29:38.333
but for you, Rebadow,

29:38.400 --> 29:41.200
trying to shank Busmalis
in the middle of the night.

29:41.266 --> 29:42.600
- I'm very sorry, sir.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.734
And I assure you, nothing
like that will happen again.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.567
- Good, because if it does,

29:46.633 --> 29:48.333
I'm sending you
to Gen Pop,

29:48.400 --> 29:51.133
where they'll eat
your ass for lunch.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.600
Take off.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.066
- You feel better now?
- Hey, killer.

30:07.133 --> 30:08.500
- Hey, killer.

30:08.567 --> 30:11.734
- Thug in the house.
Oh, yeah.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.834
- Redabow, hey,
you talk to God lately?

30:14.900 --> 30:16.767
- Watch out, Busmalis.

30:19.834 --> 30:22.300
- If you come at me, I'm
ready to go down fighting.

30:22.367 --> 30:23.467
- No, no, no, I...

30:23.533 --> 30:26.500
I-I apologize, Agamemnon.

30:26.567 --> 30:29.000
I-I don't know
what came over me.

30:29.066 --> 30:34.433
It was like I was
possessed or something.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.700
I ask for
your forgiveness.

30:36.767 --> 30:38.333
- Well...

30:43.500 --> 30:45.000
- Please?

30:46.433 --> 30:48.133
Ow!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.934
Stop!

30:54.000 --> 30:55.800
Just stop!

30:55.867 --> 30:57.433
Stop talking!

31:11.633 --> 31:13.333
- Mr. Querns, sir,
did the doctors figure out

31:13.400 --> 31:14.467
what's wrong with Rebadow?

31:14.533 --> 31:15.800
- Brain tumor.

31:15.867 --> 31:17.200
- Oh, my God.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.967
- They're shipping him
off to Benchley Memorial

31:19.033 --> 31:21.000
for emergency surgery.

31:21.066 --> 31:22.600
- Before he goes,
may I see him?

31:22.667 --> 31:24.000
- No.

31:26.266 --> 31:27.667
- He wanted me
to shake his hand.

31:27.734 --> 31:29.066
I-I didn't shake
his hand.

31:29.133 --> 31:30.333
Please, can I see him?

31:30.400 --> 31:32.033
- No.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.367
- We're here to pick up
Robert Rebadow.

31:35.433 --> 31:37.133
- Over there.

31:46.367 --> 31:48.633
- Hey, stop that.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.900
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

31:51.967 --> 31:54.066
- Relax, pop.

31:54.133 --> 31:55.834
- I want somebody
I know to go with me.

31:55.900 --> 31:58.367
- On three,
one, two, three.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.400
- I don't know you.

32:00.467 --> 32:02.633
Dr. Nathan!

32:02.700 --> 32:05.066
Dr. Nathan?

32:05.133 --> 32:07.266
Busmalis!

32:07.333 --> 32:09.166
Busmalis?

32:09.233 --> 32:13.200
Mama! Mama!

32:13.266 --> 32:14.934
Mama!

32:52.567 --> 32:54.533
- The census bureau
counts prisoners

32:54.600 --> 32:56.967
just like they count
everybody else.

32:57.033 --> 32:59.433
But the census bureau
considers prisoners

32:59.500 --> 33:02.667
as residents of the township
where the prison is located,

33:02.734 --> 33:05.166
not where they lived
before they got convicted.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.133
"So what?"
you say.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.967
The state
uses these numbers

33:09.033 --> 33:10.633
to determine
where financial aid

33:10.700 --> 33:12.800
like poverty funds
are spent.

33:12.867 --> 33:16.500
Some rinky-dink town upstate
gets a big, fat check,

33:16.567 --> 33:18.333
while the inner city,

33:18.400 --> 33:21.033
where the money would keep
people from committing crimes,

33:21.100 --> 33:23.400
gets zippity-doo-dah.

33:23.467 --> 33:27.333
The census
is senseless.

33:31.867 --> 33:34.000
- Y'all wanted to see me?

33:34.066 --> 33:35.934
- Yeah, Adebisi's got
a bug up his ass

33:36.000 --> 33:37.166
about your friend, Mobay.

33:37.233 --> 33:38.333
- Look, I don't like him.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.834
- Mobay's filled
his quota.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.900
He's bought us
five new customers.

33:40.967 --> 33:41.934
Leave him the fuck alone.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.300
- Which customers?

33:43.367 --> 33:44.967
Look, Tidd and Browne,

33:45.033 --> 33:47.066
they gave us the name
of their new babies.

33:47.133 --> 33:49.000
Mobay only knows
them by face.

33:49.066 --> 33:51.600
- You actually seen him
sell tits to anybody?

33:51.667 --> 33:52.934
- No, no.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.867
- We got the cash,
who cares?

33:54.934 --> 33:57.233
- He could be
undercover.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.100
- With the amount of shit
he shoves up his nose,

33:59.166 --> 34:00.600
no fucking chance.

34:00.667 --> 34:05.467
- Look, next time he sells,
I want you by his side.

34:05.533 --> 34:07.433
By his side!

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
- All right.
- You got it.

34:09.567 --> 34:12.467
- This hand sucks.

34:14.033 --> 34:16.633
- They insist on watching me
sell the drugs to somebody.

34:16.700 --> 34:17.934
Only I can't
legally do that.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.667
So either way,
I'm fucked.

34:19.734 --> 34:22.867
- Unless,
call your lieutenant.

34:22.934 --> 34:25.533
Have him bring in
another undercover detective.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.667
You sell the drugs
to another cop,

34:27.734 --> 34:29.100
nobody gets hurt.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.300
- Warden, that's genius.

34:31.367 --> 34:32.967
If I'm such a genius,

34:33.033 --> 34:34.967
how come I can't
pick out a poster?

34:35.033 --> 34:36.734
I mean, none of
them look like me.

35:06.467 --> 35:10.133
- See, I told you
Mobay's okay.

35:16.900 --> 35:19.633
- Bruno Goergen fell down
an elevator shaft.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.300
- Yeah, freak accident.

35:21.367 --> 35:23.266
- No, he was pushed.

35:23.333 --> 35:24.700
- Wait, wait, Mobay,
please, man, please!

35:24.767 --> 35:26.567
- Aah!

35:28.734 --> 35:30.166
- Really?

35:30.233 --> 35:32.734
- I'm here to find out
who murdered him.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.767
Any suggestions?

35:36.834 --> 35:38.100
- Nope.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.867
- You never saw Goergen

35:39.934 --> 35:41.734
have any confrontations
with anybody?

35:41.800 --> 35:43.066
- No.

35:43.133 --> 35:45.467
- And you never had
any confrontations

35:45.533 --> 35:46.633
with him yourself?

35:46.700 --> 35:48.100
-  No.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.834
- Now you see,

35:50.900 --> 35:52.400
that's not what I heard.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.734
- Look, lady,
you can keep excavating,

35:55.800 --> 35:58.700
but there are no
secrets buried in my brain.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.367
- I'll be back.

36:16.500 --> 36:17.800
- Anything?

36:17.867 --> 36:19.533
- Yeah, this one
knows something.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.467
I'm gonna let him sit there
alone for awhile,

36:21.533 --> 36:23.834
see what percolates.

36:43.066 --> 36:44.900
- Where you been?

36:44.967 --> 36:47.834
- With a homicide detective,

36:47.900 --> 36:49.700
avoiding her questions.

36:49.767 --> 36:52.633
- Relax.
She don't know nothing.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.367
- You ain't got no guilt
about what you did, do you?

36:55.433 --> 36:56.667
- Guilt?

36:56.734 --> 36:59.667
- We are, both of us,
the same, Mobay.

36:59.734 --> 37:01.300
Cop killers.

37:01.367 --> 37:03.600
Except every single day,

37:03.667 --> 37:05.934
I wish I could take
back what I'd done.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.667
- Goergen was
a monster.

37:07.734 --> 37:09.033
- Yeah.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.467
It takes a monster to
kill a monster, right?

37:11.533 --> 37:13.633
- I guess so.

37:28.433 --> 37:30.000
- Peace, black man.

37:30.066 --> 37:32.000
- You wishing me peace?

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
- Move out of my way.

37:35.567 --> 37:37.500
- You ain't going nowhere.

37:39.433 --> 37:41.100
- I see you went
to Adebisi,

37:41.166 --> 37:43.233
asked him to grease me.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.166
Is that any way
for a brother

37:45.233 --> 37:46.967
to act towards
another brother?

37:47.033 --> 37:49.033
- Move.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.233
- I could kill you
right now.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.367
- But you won't

37:52.433 --> 37:54.500
'cause Adebisi
promised Querns

37:54.567 --> 37:56.734
no violence
in Em City.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.033
Move.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.967
- Okay, Arif.

38:00.033 --> 38:02.367
But watch where you walking.

38:02.433 --> 38:04.734
You wouldn't wanna
get hit from something

38:04.800 --> 38:07.433
falling down from the sky,
now, would you?

38:17.100 --> 38:20.467
- All right, everybody,
let's go!

38:32.333 --> 38:33.734
- Do you need something?

38:33.800 --> 38:35.600
- Yes.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.266
Imam...

38:44.333 --> 38:46.867
I have committed
a great sin.

38:46.934 --> 38:49.000
- I am no longer
the imam.

38:49.066 --> 38:50.533
- I have failed.

38:50.600 --> 38:55.467
I have disgraced myself,
and our faith.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.166
And because
of my blindness,

38:58.233 --> 39:01.800
we are all in danger.

39:05.333 --> 39:06.667
- I know.

39:06.734 --> 39:08.467
- Lead us, Kareem.

39:12.066 --> 39:13.400
- No.

39:13.467 --> 39:16.600
- Stop hiding
from who you are.

39:16.667 --> 39:20.000
Stop hiding
from who God wants you to be.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.333
In the name of Allah,
I ask you, lead us.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.633
- Oh, Miss Sally.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.166
- Oh, Miss Sally.
- Miss Sally, I love you.

39:36.567 --> 39:38.433
- Attention!

39:38.500 --> 39:41.900
The following prisoners are
being transferred to Unit B.

39:41.967 --> 39:44.300
94D696, Downing.

39:44.367 --> 39:48.066
98M922, Masters.

39:48.133 --> 39:52.166
96Z506, Zonioni.

39:52.233 --> 39:54.867
Get your stuff,
follow Officer Howell out.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.734
- Let's go, ladies!

40:02.834 --> 40:05.767
- More white guys
leaving Em City?

40:05.834 --> 40:08.500
- They're white,
but they ain't guys.

40:08.567 --> 40:12.066
- Still, it's looking
pretty dark around here.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.967
- Yeah, I know
what you mean.

40:16.033 --> 40:18.233
- Oh, Miss Sally.

40:48.367 --> 40:51.500
- Prisoner number
00B563,

40:51.567 --> 40:53.333
Raymond Browne.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.800
- AKA, "Mondo" Browne.

40:55.867 --> 40:58.166
Convicted April 10th, 2000,

40:58.233 --> 40:59.967
murder in
the first degree.

41:00.033 --> 41:02.400
Sentence: 27 years.

41:02.467 --> 41:05.433
Up for parole in 11.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.533
- Fuck you, man.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.233
- Fuck you, nigger.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.934
- Hey, everybody settle down!
Everybody settle down!

41:15.000 --> 41:16.133
- What the fuck
do you want to do?

41:16.200 --> 41:18.066
- I'm a patient man,
I'll fuckin' wait.

41:18.133 --> 41:19.767
- Take Zanghi to the hole.
- What do you mean?

41:19.834 --> 41:21.300
He didn't do a fucking thing,
Johnson, and you know it.

41:21.367 --> 41:23.166
- I heard him say "nigger."
he provoked Browne.

41:23.233 --> 41:25.233
- That's bullshit!
- Back away, Pancamo.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.367
- Fuck all you guys.

41:37.834 --> 41:39.934
- Break this up, all right,
break it up!

41:40.000 --> 41:41.567
- Get out of here, come on!

41:52.867 --> 41:54.367
- Yeah!

41:57.133 --> 41:58.633
- That's right,
do it, baby.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.533
Slowly, slowly.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.767
- Put it in your mouth!

42:03.834 --> 42:05.300
- Kiss my foot,
kiss it.

42:05.367 --> 42:07.600
- ♪ Baby ♪

42:34.600 --> 42:35.767
Hello, boys.

42:35.834 --> 42:37.066
- We gotta talk.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.166
- So talk.
- What the fuck are you doing?

42:39.233 --> 42:40.834
We're your partners.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.533
You think
you're gonna fuck us over

42:42.600 --> 42:44.467
and we're just gonna
take it up the ass?

42:45.367 --> 42:47.967
- Morales, nobody
wants your ass.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.433
- Johnson hits me
with his fuckin' stick,

42:49.500 --> 42:51.433
throws Zanghi
in the hole.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.133
That ain't the
fucking deal, Adebisi.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.734
- Besides,
it's been ten days

42:55.800 --> 42:58.033
since we've
seen any green.

42:58.100 --> 43:00.767
You pocketing
the profits?

43:00.834 --> 43:03.767
- No, there's
plenty of profits.

43:03.834 --> 43:06.400
But there's been a change
in the organization.

43:06.467 --> 43:07.934
- How so?

43:09.200 --> 43:12.000
- Well, you know,
we three were partners

43:12.066 --> 43:13.734
and now we're not.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.000
- What?

43:15.066 --> 43:17.266
- I don't need
you boys anymore.

43:20.567 --> 43:22.467
- You lookin'
to start a war?

43:22.533 --> 43:26.800
- You know, if there
was a war, you'd lose.

43:28.667 --> 43:30.033
Look around.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.500
See all these faces?

43:36.333 --> 43:38.600
They match mine.

43:40.867 --> 43:43.000
No, boys,
there won't be any war.

43:43.066 --> 43:44.633
- And why the fuck not?

43:44.700 --> 43:48.266
- Because you and your pal
are about to take

43:48.333 --> 43:50.233
a little holiday
over to Unit B.

43:50.300 --> 43:52.133
- What, when?

43:53.166 --> 43:54.567
- Oh, look.

43:54.633 --> 43:57.200
I would say now.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.867
Come on.

44:02.467 --> 44:06.033
Hey, I'm gonna
miss you, yeah.

44:07.266 --> 44:10.166
Say "hi" to Schillinger
for me, huh?

44:13.700 --> 44:15.367
- Oh, no!

44:21.967 --> 44:23.500
- As you can see,

44:23.567 --> 44:26.200
we have some more
prisoner transfers,

44:26.266 --> 44:29.667
including trustees
Pancamo and Morales.

44:29.734 --> 44:33.667
So, I'm naming
Supreme Allah

44:33.734 --> 44:37.767
and Poet to replace them
as trustees.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.300
- Hey, Said.

45:00.367 --> 45:01.934
I told you.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.567
I told you
to join me, hmm?

45:04.633 --> 45:08.100
But you never listen,
you never listen.

45:08.166 --> 45:09.467
You know what?

45:09.533 --> 45:11.800
That is what is gonna
kill you in the end.

45:11.867 --> 45:14.066
- And what's gonna
kill you, Adebisi,

45:14.133 --> 45:16.767
AIDS or an O.D.?

45:16.834 --> 45:19.066
- Don't worry about me.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.734
- I don't.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.834
I worry about
the people around you,

45:22.900 --> 45:25.533
breathing the air
you poison.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.467
- Look, I've
created a utopia.

45:28.533 --> 45:31.200
Your Shangri-La Samaa.

45:31.266 --> 45:33.233
- This is not Samaa!

45:33.300 --> 45:35.734
This is an inferno.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.400
- We have all the control
and all the power, finally.

45:40.467 --> 45:42.567
- A bad system
run by blacks

45:42.633 --> 45:45.367
is the same
as a bad system run by whites.

45:45.433 --> 45:47.133
- But...

45:47.200 --> 45:49.467
we have
everything we want.

45:49.533 --> 45:51.500
We have everything
in our grasp.

45:51.567 --> 45:55.333
- You think you've recreated
the world, don't you?

45:55.400 --> 45:58.333
Simon...

45:58.400 --> 46:01.100
it's just
an illusion.

46:01.166 --> 46:03.667
Real power
can only come from

46:03.734 --> 46:07.467
the grace
of God the Almighty.

46:07.533 --> 46:09.400
- If I wanted to,

46:09.467 --> 46:12.800
I could crush you
like a cockroach.

46:12.867 --> 46:15.500
- Yes, but you won't.

46:15.567 --> 46:17.834
Because I am the only one

46:17.900 --> 46:20.867
who speaks
the truth to you.

46:23.467 --> 46:26.400
- Your truth, not mine.

46:44.100 --> 46:47.233
- Adebisi's turned Em City
into a fucking Zulu nation.

46:47.300 --> 46:49.066
- What the fuck are
we supposed to do?

46:49.133 --> 46:52.000
- Create our own country.

46:58.533 --> 47:01.800
McManus,
we gotta talk.

47:01.867 --> 47:04.166
- Make an appointment
with my secretary.

47:04.233 --> 47:05.800
- This is serious.

47:05.867 --> 47:07.700
- Yeah, I can tell.

47:07.767 --> 47:10.367
You've got that
Schillinger scowl going.

47:10.433 --> 47:12.467
- Your precious
little dream,

47:12.533 --> 47:15.233
your Emerald City,
is now a ghetto.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.600
You been there lately?

47:16.667 --> 47:18.300
Crap all over
the floors,

47:18.367 --> 47:19.800
drugs everywhere,

47:19.867 --> 47:22.000
the lack
of primary colors.

47:22.066 --> 47:24.734
- Well, that unit is
no longer my responsibility.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.934
- Hey, I got no
problem with that.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.133
What we don't want is
that new attitude over there

47:29.200 --> 47:31.433
to come
wafting this way.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.000
They hear about
what's going on,

47:34.066 --> 47:35.900
empowerment,

47:35.967 --> 47:37.767
they're gonna want
the same thing here.

47:37.834 --> 47:40.567
- And you're
suggesting, what,

47:40.633 --> 47:43.233
that we make
Unit B all white?

47:43.300 --> 47:44.567
- Yes.

47:44.633 --> 47:47.100
- Get the fuck
away from me.

47:47.166 --> 47:48.700
- Let the niggers
have Em City.

47:48.767 --> 47:50.600
Fuck, let them have
the whole goddamn prison

47:50.667 --> 47:52.100
as long as
we're safe over here.

47:52.166 --> 47:54.533
- Goodbye, Vern.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.433
- Don't be a bigger fool
than you've already been.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.467
- Lockdown!

47:58.533 --> 48:00.266
Lock the unit down!

48:00.333 --> 48:02.100
- You'll see.

48:02.166 --> 48:03.467
You'll wish you
listened to me, McManus.

48:03.533 --> 48:04.700
- Now!

48:12.400 --> 48:14.066
- The new electric
perimeter fencing

48:14.133 --> 48:15.734
will go into operation
next Wednesday.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.433
As of then,
we'll be able to eliminate

48:17.500 --> 48:19.734
the 24-hour watchtower
surveillance,

48:19.800 --> 48:21.567
which should save us
countless man hours.

48:21.633 --> 48:24.934
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.200
Emerald City
is a shit house.

48:27.266 --> 48:28.467
- McManus--

48:28.533 --> 48:30.433
- There's garbage
all over the place.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.600
- Oh, and in Unit B,
you can eat off the floor.

48:32.667 --> 48:33.967
- Enough!

48:34.033 --> 48:35.433
- The motherfucker's
jealous of me.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.433
- Jealous?
- That's right, jealous.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.000
- Martin, please.

48:38.066 --> 48:39.867
- No, he knows that since
I took over Em City,

48:39.934 --> 48:41.834
there's been
next to no violence.

48:41.900 --> 48:43.433
My system works.

48:43.500 --> 48:44.734
- At what price?

48:45.834 --> 48:47.066
Huh?

48:49.500 --> 48:51.934
At what fucking price?

48:59.667 --> 49:01.367
- McManus?

49:06.200 --> 49:08.467
McManus!

49:11.800 --> 49:15.367
For God's sake,
McManus, stop, please.

49:24.967 --> 49:28.900
Conditions in Emerald City
are deteriorating rapidly.

49:28.967 --> 49:31.900
Something has to be done
to stop Adebisi.

49:31.967 --> 49:33.934
- Hey, why are you
coming to me?

49:34.000 --> 49:35.934
Talk to Querns.
- I have.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.667
Querns is willing
to turn a blind eye

49:37.734 --> 49:38.834
to what Adebisi
is doing

49:38.900 --> 49:40.734
as long as order
is maintained.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.767
- Then talk to Glynn.

49:42.834 --> 49:43.967
- I've tried that too.

49:44.033 --> 49:46.200
He seems indifferent,
distracted,

49:46.266 --> 49:49.300
because of
his election campaign.

49:49.367 --> 49:51.000
No.

49:51.066 --> 49:53.166
It's up to you and me.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.033
- You and me?

49:56.100 --> 50:00.033
- Adebisi needs to be
shut down and fast.

50:00.100 --> 50:04.200
If that means
eliminating Querns,

50:04.266 --> 50:05.734
so be it.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.100
- You have a plan?

50:10.166 --> 50:12.734
- Yeah.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.200
I have a plan.

50:37.533 --> 50:40.433
I was wrong,
Adebisi.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.600
I see that now.

50:44.233 --> 50:47.433
You truly have transformed
this cell block,

50:47.500 --> 50:51.734
into a paradise,
a utopia.

50:51.800 --> 50:56.400
And I'm gonna to say it
for everybody to hear.

50:56.467 --> 50:59.533
I want to join you,

50:59.600 --> 51:02.400
and serve you in
whatever way you choose.

51:11.100 --> 51:12.567
- Are you serious?

51:12.633 --> 51:14.700
- Yes.

51:16.767 --> 51:21.233
- Then swear to me
in the name of Allah.

51:25.166 --> 51:26.967
- I do so swear.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.367
- I've waited
for this moment.

51:38.033 --> 51:40.600
Now I can raise you
as my equal.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.533
Together,

51:42.600 --> 51:44.934
there's nothing
we can't do.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.867
Nothing!

51:47.967 --> 51:49.066
Nothing...

51:50.433 --> 51:54.233
Nothing. Nothing.

51:54.300 --> 51:57.834
Nothing.

51:57.900 --> 52:03.266
Nothing, nothing...

52:03.333 --> 52:06.200
all chanting:
What? Nothing. What? Nothing.

52:06.266 --> 52:08.400
What? Nothing.
Come on. Nothing.

52:08.467 --> 52:11.333
Come on. What?
Nothing. What? Nothing.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.433
Nothing. Hey! Nothing.
Come on.

52:17.633 --> 52:20.900
Nothing! Come on! Nothing!
Come on!

52:20.967 --> 52:26.367
Nothing. Hey! Nothing.
Come on. Nothing!

52:30.667 --> 52:33.533
- Adebisi and Said,
hand in hand.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.367
That's the end of
the fucking universe.

52:41.900 --> 52:44.100
- Those census numbers
I was talking about,

52:44.166 --> 52:47.433
they're also used
to determine election districts.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.033
A senator from a white,
rural area with a prison,

52:51.100 --> 52:53.734
can count the inmates
as his constitutes,

52:53.800 --> 52:56.800
and, therefore, increase
his political influence.

52:56.867 --> 52:59.533
Those inmates,
who are largely of color,

52:59.600 --> 53:01.400
aren't allowed to vote.

53:01.467 --> 53:04.367
The senator has
no allegiance to them at all.

53:04.433 --> 53:07.533
In fact, he benefits
by voting for laws

53:07.600 --> 53:10.333
to keep them
incarcerated longer.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.834
The town benefits

53:11.900 --> 53:14.800
by the increased
prison population.

53:14.867 --> 53:16.533
Yeah.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.600
Everybody benefits.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.533
- Somebody must
stop him and soon.

53:30.734 --> 53:32.033
- Lenore.

53:32.100 --> 53:34.166
- Look, I'm sorry
for stopping by so suddenly.

53:34.233 --> 53:35.867
I know you're busy
running things,

53:35.934 --> 53:37.467
and with the
campaign and all,

53:37.533 --> 53:39.066
but I didn't know
who else to call.

53:39.133 --> 53:40.166
- Well, what's
the matter?

53:40.233 --> 53:42.066
- It's Clayton.

53:42.133 --> 53:45.166
Sweet Jesus, I don't know
my own son anymore.

53:45.233 --> 53:47.066
I mean, with him giving
the inmate the gun

53:47.133 --> 53:49.300
and then the African dress
and now...

53:49.367 --> 53:51.433
- What?

53:51.500 --> 53:54.000
- I found this
in his room.

53:57.934 --> 54:00.567
It's like he's collected all
of his anger toward the world

54:00.633 --> 54:02.333
and is pointing it
toward the governor.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.100
- Where's Clayton now?

54:04.166 --> 54:06.667
- I don't know--
hasn't been home in days.

54:06.734 --> 54:09.967
- Well, when he comes back,
you call me, okay?

54:10.033 --> 54:13.266
In the meantime,
try not to worry, all right?

54:18.100 --> 54:20.033
- With these new
stab-proof vests,

54:20.100 --> 54:21.700
the correctional
officers here,

54:21.767 --> 54:23.000
and across the state will have

54:23.066 --> 54:25.100
the very best protection.

54:25.166 --> 54:29.033
Their safety
is paramount to me.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.867
These are
the men and women

54:30.934 --> 54:34.166
who keep the forces
of darkness at bay.

54:34.233 --> 54:37.867
There are those who say,
"No more prisons."

54:37.934 --> 54:41.467
Well, I say,
"No more crime."

54:41.533 --> 54:43.467
- Fuck you!

55:00.367 --> 55:02.300
- somebody get a doctor!

55:06.934 --> 55:09.800
Get a medic!
Get me some help!

55:09.867 --> 55:11.767
Get some help!

55:13.934 --> 55:15.533
Get a doctor!
