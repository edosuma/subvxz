--->   Skeebdo.com

01:13.504 --> 01:14.810
BE READY.

01:14.811 --> 01:17.022
WHEN THE TRAINS ARE
SWITCHED ONTO THE SIDING,

01:17.023 --> 01:19.032
WE WILL HIJACK
THE SPECIAL CHEMICALS

01:19.033 --> 01:20.707
ON BOARD EACH ONE.

01:20.708 --> 01:21.913
MIXING THEM TOGETHER

01:21.914 --> 01:24.326
WILL CREATE
OUR FAMOUS MUTAGEN.

01:28.649 --> 01:30.156
WHY HAVEN'T
ROCK STEADY AND BEBOP

01:30.157 --> 01:31.362
THROWN THE SWITCH?

01:31.363 --> 01:33.706
WHAT ARE THEY
WAITING FOR?

01:33.707 --> 01:36.521
BAH! YOU SHOULD
NEVER SEND A MUTANT

01:36.522 --> 01:38.297
TO DO A MAN'S JOB.

01:38.298 --> 01:41.547
IT'S MY TURN TO
PULL THE SWITCH.

01:41.548 --> 01:44.830
HEY, YOU GOT
TO PULL THE LAST ONE!

01:44.831 --> 01:46.405
DID NOT.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.014
DID TOO.

01:48.015 --> 01:50.359
DID NOT!

01:51.365 --> 01:53.541
DID TOO!

01:53.542 --> 01:54.614
MY TURN!
MY TURN!

01:54.615 --> 01:55.787
ME! ME!
UH-UH.

01:55.788 --> 01:57.864
ME! ME!

01:57.865 --> 02:00.344
WHAT ARE THOSE
2 IDIOTS DOING?

02:03.092 --> 02:05.603
LET GO OF THAT SWITCH.

02:05.604 --> 02:07.681
<i>NO, YOU LET GO.</i>

02:10.127 --> 02:12.037
NO! STOP!

02:13.143 --> 02:16.158
THOSE MUTANT MORONS
HAVE RUINED EVERYTHING!

02:18.337 --> 02:20.414
YOU MISERABLE MAGGOTS,

02:20.415 --> 02:22.926
WAIT UNTIL KRANG
HEARS WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

02:30.499 --> 02:32.005
HOWDY, PARTNERS.

02:32.006 --> 02:35.658
<i>IT'S TIME FOR
6-GUN SAGEBRUSH THEATER,</i>

02:35.659 --> 02:37.333
WITH TODAY'S MOVIE,

02:37.334 --> 02:39.344
<i>SHOOTOUT
AT THE CACTUS CORRAL.</i>

02:39.345 --> 02:42.527
COME ON, DUDES.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

02:42.528 --> 02:46.279
LET'S WATCH SOMETHING
EDUCATIONAL FOR ONCE.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.725
THERE'S A MONDO
SURFING FLICK ON,

02:48.726 --> 02:50.634
<i>WAIKIKI WAVE WALKERS.</i>

02:50.635 --> 02:53.449
IT'S TOTALLY TUBULOSO.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.091
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.670
TOUCH THAT DIAL,
AND YOU'RE HISTORY.

02:57.671 --> 02:59.949
<i>NO, TRUST ME,
COMPADRES,</i>

02:59.950 --> 03:01.523
YOU'LL REALLY
DIG IT.

03:02.965 --> 03:06.215
THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A FOOD FIGHT.

03:06.216 --> 03:08.928
DEEP DISH PIZZA,
TO BE EXACT.

03:08.929 --> 03:11.441
I'M CALLING YOU OUT,
DUDE!

03:11.442 --> 03:13.954
GO AHEAD.
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

03:13.955 --> 03:16.735
RAPHAEL,
MICHELANGELO...

03:16.736 --> 03:19.147
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF SUCH DISHARMONY?

03:19.148 --> 03:21.626
WE'RE ALL TO BLAME,
MASTER SPLINTER.

03:21.627 --> 03:23.671
WE WERE TRYING
TO DECIDE WHAT TO WATCH.

03:23.672 --> 03:25.379
SORRY, BUCKAROOS.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.256
BUT WE HAVE TO
INTERRUPT OUR PROGRAM

03:27.257 --> 03:29.266
FOR THIS SPECIAL
NEWS BULLETIN.

03:29.267 --> 03:31.946
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
REPORTING LIVE

03:31.947 --> 03:33.991
FROM THE DOWNTOWN
RAILROAD YARD.

03:33.992 --> 03:36.302
2 FREIGHT TRAINS
HAVE JUST COLLIDED

03:36.303 --> 03:38.112
ON THE SIDING
NEAR THE STOCKYARD,

03:38.113 --> 03:40.155
AND POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS CHEMICALS

03:40.156 --> 03:42.300
ARE LEAKING FROM
THE WRECKED TANK CARS.

03:42.301 --> 03:44.176
THEY'RE A LOT
MORE DANGEROUS

03:44.177 --> 03:45.952
THAN APRIL
REALIZES.

03:45.953 --> 03:47.527
THOSE ARE
THE CHEMICALS

03:47.528 --> 03:49.670
THAT ARE MIXED
TO CREATE MUTAGEN.

03:50.878 --> 03:53.725
I DON'T WISH TO HEAR

03:53.726 --> 03:56.673
ANY MORE OF YOUR
MISERABLE EXCUSES.

03:56.674 --> 03:58.583
JUST ONE MORE,
BOSS.

03:58.584 --> 03:59.756
IT'S A REAL
DOOZY.

04:00.863 --> 04:02.268
ENOUGH!

04:02.269 --> 04:04.413
YOUR BUMBLING
HAS COST ME

04:04.414 --> 04:08.031
THE CHEMICALS I NEED
TO MAKE MORE MUTAGEN.

04:08.032 --> 04:10.645
WITHOUT IT,
I CANNOT CREATE

04:10.646 --> 04:12.723
MY ARMY OF MUTANTS.

04:12.724 --> 04:16.240
WHY DO YOU NEED
MORE MUTANTS, KRANG?

04:16.241 --> 04:19.356
YEAH, YOU'VE
ALREADY GOT US.

04:19.357 --> 04:21.869
I REST MY CASE.

04:21.870 --> 04:25.219
SHREDDER, I MUST
HAVE THAT MUTAGEN.

04:25.220 --> 04:28.704
YOU CAN'T HAVE
TOO MUCH OF A BAD THING.

04:28.705 --> 04:30.748
WE'LL GO BACK
TO THE SURFACE.

04:30.749 --> 04:34.099
AND THIS TIME,
WE SHALL NOT FAIL.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.745
WELL? DON'T
JUST STAND THERE.

04:36.746 --> 04:38.253
COME ON!

04:38.254 --> 04:40.130
OUCH, BOSS!

04:40.131 --> 04:43.916
A RHINO'S EARS
ARE REAL SENSITIVE.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.300
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M PULLING ON THEM?

04:51.388 --> 04:54.068
VERNON, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:54.069 --> 04:56.346
I FELT A STORY
AS BIG AS THIS

04:56.347 --> 04:58.457
MIGHT NEED A MORE
PROFESSIONAL TOUCH.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.903
MORE PROFESSIONAL?

05:00.904 --> 05:03.081
THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO GET THE GLORY--

05:03.082 --> 05:06.029
UH, I MEAN,
THE STORY MYSELF.

05:07.471 --> 05:08.977
VERNON, YOU RAT!

05:08.978 --> 05:11.456
I HOPE YOU--YOU--YOU...

05:11.457 --> 05:14.003
OOH, YOU HAVE
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES!

05:14.004 --> 05:15.377
APRIL,

05:15.378 --> 05:17.655
YOU'VE GOT TO
GET EVERYBODY
OUT OF THE AREA.

05:17.656 --> 05:20.168
THOSE CHEMICALS
IN THE WRECKED
TANK CARS

05:20.169 --> 05:22.513
ARE MIXING TOGETHER
TO MAKE MUTAGEN.

05:22.514 --> 05:24.859
MUTAGEN?
ARE YOU SURE?

05:24.860 --> 05:28.377
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
GUACAMOLE DIP.

05:28.378 --> 05:30.722
VERNON'S IN THAT
AREA RIGHT NOW!

05:30.723 --> 05:33.537
HE COULD MUTATE INTO
SOME GROTESQUE CREATURE.

05:33.538 --> 05:34.743
IN VERNON'S CASE,

05:34.744 --> 05:36.317
THAT COULD BE
AN IMPROVEMENT.

05:36.318 --> 05:39.266
FELLAS, WE CAN'T LET
VERNON'S PERSONALITY

05:39.267 --> 05:41.042
KEEP US FROM HELPING HIM.

05:41.043 --> 05:43.789
YEAH. HE'S STILL
A HUMAN BEING.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.062
SORT OF.

05:45.063 --> 05:46.972
BESIDES,
HE MIGHT MUTATE

05:46.973 --> 05:49.150
INTO SOMETHING
EVEN MORE OBNOXIOUS.

05:49.151 --> 05:50.323
LET'S GET HIM!

05:50.324 --> 05:51.629
COME ON!
LET'S GO!

05:56.288 --> 05:59.403
THIS IS THE MESSIEST
TRAIN WRECK I'VE EVER SEEN.

05:59.404 --> 06:01.949
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I'LL LET APRIL COVER IT.

06:05.133 --> 06:08.281
HMM. THE GLAMOROUS LIFE
OF A TV REPORTER.

06:08.282 --> 06:09.923
WHAT A LOT OF BULL.

06:20.479 --> 06:24.431
WHOA! THAT IS ONE
HUMONGOUS HAMBURGER.

06:24.432 --> 06:25.838
WE'VE GOT TO SAVE VERNON

06:25.839 --> 06:28.351
BEFORE HE'S SQUISHED
FLATTER THAN A PIZZA!

06:28.352 --> 06:30.630
THIS OUGHTA MAKE
HIM SEE RED.

06:33.746 --> 06:34.884
<i>HA, TORO!</i>

06:34.885 --> 06:36.426
<i>YOO-HOO. TORO!</i>

06:36.427 --> 06:39.072
<i>TORO! TORO!</i>

06:41.419 --> 06:44.399
NOW, THAT'S TAKING
THE BULL BY THE HORNS.

06:46.478 --> 06:48.655
OK, LEONARDO.
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

06:48.656 --> 06:50.800
I'M OPEN TO
SUGGESTIONS!

06:50.801 --> 06:53.648
I HATE TO SAY
A DISCOURAGING WORD, DUDES,

06:53.649 --> 06:56.495
BUT ULTIMO BUMMER!

06:57.502 --> 07:00.248
WE'RE TRAPPED IN
A BOXCAR CANYON.

07:06.112 --> 07:08.289
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT THING!

07:08.290 --> 07:09.730
WITH ALL THOSE HORNS,

07:09.731 --> 07:12.042
HE LOOKS LIKE
SHREDDER ON THE HOOF.

07:12.043 --> 07:15.694
BACK OFF, BEEF-A-RAMA,
OR YOU'RE SHISH KEBAB.

07:18.274 --> 07:19.279
EARTHQUAKE!
MOMMY!

07:23.167 --> 07:24.740
IT'S SHREDDER!

07:24.741 --> 07:26.784
HE SURE KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.518
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.941
<i>NOW I REMEMBER!</i>

07:39.718 --> 07:41.058
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

07:41.059 --> 07:42.397
YOU COVER THE STORY.

07:42.398 --> 07:44.173
THANKS A BUNDLE.

07:44.175 --> 07:46.385
I'LL SHOW HIM
HOW A REAL REPORTER

07:46.386 --> 07:47.826
HANDLES A STORY.

07:47.827 --> 07:49.400
WHAT?!

07:49.401 --> 07:51.410
THE CHEMICALS
MUST HAVE COMBINED

07:51.411 --> 07:55.096
TO FORM MUTAGEN AND
CREATED THIS MUTANT MONSTER.

07:55.097 --> 07:57.609
WITH SUCH A CREATURE
AT MY COMMAND,

07:57.610 --> 08:01.261
<i>I CAN DESTROY
THE TURTLES AND KRANG.</i>

08:01.262 --> 08:04.477
THE OLD
DOUBLE-CROSS,
HUH, BOSS?

08:04.478 --> 08:05.851
NEVER MIND.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.995
JUST BRING
THE BEAST TO ME.

08:07.996 --> 08:09.503
JUST MY LUCK.

08:09.504 --> 08:14.026
I-I LEFT MY CATTLE PROD
IN MY OTHER SUIT.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.366
COWARDS!

08:15.367 --> 08:17.980
MUST I DO
EVERYTHING MYSELF?

08:17.981 --> 08:20.057
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

08:20.058 --> 08:23.006
BAH! YOU INCOMPETENT WIMPS!

08:25.419 --> 08:27.830
YOU WILL OBEY
MY COMMANDS.

08:29.473 --> 08:32.086
THAT IS THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

08:32.087 --> 08:35.134
UH-OH.
IT'S SHREDDER!

08:35.135 --> 08:37.144
NOW ATTACK THE TURTLES!

08:37.145 --> 08:38.886
I COMMAND YOU!

08:42.573 --> 08:44.080
I AM YOUR MASTER.

08:44.081 --> 08:46.862
YOU WILL BOW TO
MY SUPERIOR WILL.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.882
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE NOT IN THE MOOD.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.467
OUT OF MY WAY,
YOU KLUTZES!

08:55.641 --> 08:57.147
WHAT A SCOOP!

08:57.148 --> 08:59.157
THE GREAT SHREDDER
STAMPEDED.

09:01.571 --> 09:04.519
OH, UM...
NICE HORNS.

09:08.272 --> 09:09.511
COME ON GUYS,

09:09.512 --> 09:12.224
IT'S TIME FOR
SOME TURTLE TACTICS.

09:13.298 --> 09:15.911
MAMA!

09:17.821 --> 09:19.328
OK, FELLAS...

09:19.329 --> 09:20.701
NOW!

09:22.846 --> 09:26.632
CHILL OUT, DUDE.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.710
HOW DO YOU
STEER A STEER?

09:28.711 --> 09:29.949
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.457
I'M JUST ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

09:31.458 --> 09:35.578
THIS OUGHT TO MAKE
A MONSTER-SIZED SPUR.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.794
REALLY SMART MOVE,
LEONARDO.

09:41.475 --> 09:44.557
I HOPE WE'VE ALL
LEARNED SOMETHING
FROM THIS.

09:44.558 --> 09:47.505
YEAH, NEVER RIDE A MONSTER
WITHOUT A SEAT BELT.

09:49.551 --> 09:52.029
MAYBE IT WON'T
FIND ME HERE.

09:53.068 --> 09:54.508
YOU?!

09:54.509 --> 09:57.456
SHH! DON'T MAKE
SO MUCH NOISE.

10:00.372 --> 10:01.611
WE'VE GOT TO
THINK UP A WAY

10:01.612 --> 10:03.051
TO FIGHT THIS THING!

10:03.052 --> 10:05.565
THEN WE BETTER START
THINKING BIG, DUDES.

10:05.566 --> 10:08.413
THIS IS ONE
MONDO MONSTER.

10:08.414 --> 10:09.786
HOLD EVERYTHING!

10:09.787 --> 10:10.523
I'VE GOT THE ANSWER.

10:10.524 --> 10:11.663
HOLD EVERYTHING!

10:11.664 --> 10:13.673
HE COULD AT LEAST
SAY PLEASE.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.492
SOMEONE MAKE A LASSO
OF THAT CABLE.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.704
IT'S TIME FOR
A FEW ROPE TRICKS.

10:22.519 --> 10:23.893
TAKE IT AWAY, PARTNER!

10:30.460 --> 10:32.268
I'VE ROPED HIM,
BUCKAROOS!

10:32.269 --> 10:34.580
NOW YOU CAN HOG TIE
AND BRAND HIM.

10:34.581 --> 10:38.600
<i>YEAH, YOU DUDES
HAVE BEEN WATCHING
TOO MANY WESTERNS.</i>

10:42.991 --> 10:44.029
WHA--

10:44.030 --> 10:46.307
WHOA, BIG FELLA!

10:46.308 --> 10:48.318
I THINK HE NEEDS
A LITTLE HELP.

10:48.319 --> 10:49.490
A LITTLE HELP?

10:49.491 --> 10:51.835
HE NEEDS THE ENTIRE
23rd CAVALRY.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.698
LET ME GO, BOSS!

10:57.699 --> 11:00.547
THE TURTLES ARE
ESCAPING WITH
MY MONSTER!

11:00.548 --> 11:02.423
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

11:02.424 --> 11:04.065
YOU WANT TO BET?

11:04.066 --> 11:05.438
WELL, DON'T
JUST STAND THERE!

11:05.439 --> 11:06.611
START PUMPING!

11:06.612 --> 11:11.168
WHEN YOU SAY, "PUMP,"
WE SAY, "HOW HIGH?"

11:11.169 --> 11:13.312
WHAT FANTASTIC FOOTAGE!

11:14.352 --> 11:16.696
FASTER,
YOU BUG BRAINS!

11:17.970 --> 11:19.510
MIND IF I CUT IN?

11:25.208 --> 11:27.250
DONATELLO,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:27.251 --> 11:29.228
DONATELLO?

11:29.229 --> 11:32.243
WHO'S DONATELLO?

11:32.244 --> 11:34.018
YEAH. HE'S FINE.

11:34.019 --> 11:37.034
THAT WILL PUT
A STOP TO THOSE
MEDDLING TURTLES.

11:39.815 --> 11:43.132
GET OFF ME,
YOU OVERWEIGHT OAFS.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.348
IT'S THE END OF
THE LINE, SHREDDER.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.653
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

11:53.654 --> 11:55.194
IT SPLIT IN HALF.

11:55.195 --> 11:58.175
OH, SWELL.
STEERS IN STEREO.

11:59.684 --> 12:02.431
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A SPLIT SCREEN TO SHOW THIS.

12:05.715 --> 12:08.898
THIS IS MORE THAN
I BARGAINED FOR.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.773
HEY, DON'T KNOCK IT,
SHRED HEAD!

12:10.774 --> 12:13.119
NOW WE CAN EACH
HAVE A MONSTER!

12:13.120 --> 12:15.934
I THINK SHREDDER'S
GOT THE RIGHT IDEA.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.105
I'M WITH YOU,
DUDE.

12:17.106 --> 12:19.116
LET'S HOOF IT!

12:34.061 --> 12:36.271
THE 2 OF 'EM
HAVE APRIL SURROUNDED.

12:46.591 --> 12:50.008
IT'S RE-FORMED BACK
INTO ONE MONSTER AGAIN.

12:50.009 --> 12:54.196
ONLY NOW IT'S
A MONSTER AND A HALF.

12:54.197 --> 12:56.441
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
APRIL?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.691
NO, I'M NOT
ALL RIGHT.

12:59.692 --> 13:01.735
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY FOOTAGE ON IT.

13:01.736 --> 13:03.577
DON'T FEEL BAD, APRIL.

13:03.578 --> 13:05.889
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MAY
GET ANOTHER CHANCE.

13:05.890 --> 13:07.565
IT'S HEADED
FOR OUR CITY.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.657
APRIL,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:12.658 --> 13:15.439
AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:15.440 --> 13:18.521
LET'S JUST SAY
I WAS GIVEN A BUM STEER.

13:18.522 --> 13:20.297
HAS VERNON
COME BACK YET?

13:20.298 --> 13:21.469
YES, BUT--

13:21.470 --> 13:23.044
HE WON'T COME
OUT OF HIS OFFICE.

13:23.045 --> 13:25.658
AND HE SURE
SEEMS NERVOUS.

13:25.659 --> 13:28.305
TRY BRINGING HIM A NICE
GLASS OF WARM MILK.

13:28.306 --> 13:30.784
THAT A

13:30.785 --> 13:32.794
LOOK, VERNON,

13:32.795 --> 13:35.307
I'VE BROUGHT
YOU SOMETHING.

13:35.308 --> 13:37.988
A NICE GLASS
OF WARM...

13:37.989 --> 13:40.165
MILK!? 

13:43.383 --> 13:46.699
A SIMPLE "NO THANKS"
WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.541
AND YOU SAY
THE CREATURE

13:48.542 --> 13:50.318
BECAME
2 SEPARATE ONES?

13:50.319 --> 13:51.724
THAT'S RIGHT, SENSEI,

13:51.725 --> 13:53.634
AND THEN IT JOINED
TOGETHER AGAIN.

13:53.635 --> 13:56.482
I GUESS IT JUST COULDN'T
STAND BEING APART.

13:56.483 --> 13:59.263
HMM. THAT IS
MOST STRANGE.

13:59.264 --> 14:01.106
IT COULD ONLY MEAN
ONE THING--

14:01.107 --> 14:02.949
THAT THE MONSTER'S
MUTANT FORM

14:02.950 --> 14:04.188
IS STILL UNSTABLE.

14:04.189 --> 14:06.935
OH, I HOPE THERE'S
NOT A JOKE COMING UP

14:06.936 --> 14:09.549
ABOUT A BUNCH
OF COWS AND A STABLE.

14:09.550 --> 14:10.990
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

14:10.991 --> 14:13.000
A MASSIVE DOSE
OF DIRECTED ENERGY

14:13.001 --> 14:14.340
MIGHT BREAK DOWN

14:14.341 --> 14:16.149
THE MONSTER'S
MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

14:16.150 --> 14:18.194
BEFORE IT'S
PERMANENTLY SET.

14:18.195 --> 14:20.673
HOW DO YOU INTEND
ARRANGING THAT,
DONATELLO?

14:20.674 --> 14:23.220
THE UNIVERSITY
HAS AN ATOM SMASHER.

14:23.221 --> 14:24.895
MAYBE I CAN ALTER IT

14:24.896 --> 14:27.005
TO BREAK DOWN
MUTANT MOLECULES.

14:27.006 --> 14:29.887
SO, LIKE, HOW DO WE
ROUND UP CUDZILLA

14:29.888 --> 14:32.098
AND GET IT
TO THE ATOM SMASHER?

14:32.099 --> 14:33.740
TO DEFEAT YOUR ENEMY,

14:33.741 --> 14:36.789
YOU MUST FIRST LEARN
TO THINK LIKE YOUR ENEMY.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.934
WHOA, HOLD ON, HERE.

14:38.935 --> 14:42.083
YOU MEAN I GOTTA
THINK LIKE A COW?

14:42.084 --> 14:44.763
YOU CAN DO IT...
IF YOU STUDY NIGHTS.

14:44.764 --> 14:48.113
I WILL HELP
DONATELLO PREPARE
THE ATOM SMASHER.

14:48.114 --> 14:49.823
THE REST OF YOU
MUST FIND
THE CREATURE,

14:49.824 --> 14:50.995
QUICKLY.

14:52.336 --> 14:55.082
KRANG, I COULD NOT
CONTROL THE MUTAGEN MONSTER.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.026
P.

14:57.027 --> 14:59.237
IT'S NICE
TO BE WANTED.

14:59.238 --> 15:02.923
YEAH. I KNOW
JUST WHAT YOU MEAN.

15:02.924 --> 15:05.234
NOW PAY ATTENTION.

15:05.235 --> 15:08.853
THIS RECEPTOR RING
WILL MAKE THE BEAST
FOLLOW ORDERS

15:08.854 --> 15:13.510
SENT FROM THIS
REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE.

15:13.511 --> 15:17.129
HEY, I REMEMBER
THESE THINGS.

15:18.873 --> 15:20.714
NO, YOU BUFFOON.

15:20.715 --> 15:24.064
YOU'RE TO PLACE IT
IN THE CREATURE'S NOSE,

15:24.065 --> 15:28.186
THEN COMMAND IT TO
DESTROY THE TURTLES.

15:28.187 --> 15:29.861
IT WILL BE DONE.

15:29.862 --> 15:33.546
BY THE WAY, IN CASE
YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS

15:33.547 --> 15:36.428
ABOUT TURNING THE
CREATURE AGAINST ME,

15:36.429 --> 15:39.745
REMEMBER THAT I, TOO,
HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL

15:39.746 --> 15:42.023
MORE POWERFUL
THAN YOURS.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.269
MINE WORKS THE TV,

15:44.270 --> 15:47.786
THE VCR,
AND THE STEREO.

15:47.787 --> 15:49.629
THAT'S STRANGE.

15:49.630 --> 15:51.874
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS
STREET SO EMPTY BEFORE.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.789
THE MAYOR HAS
ASKED ALL CITIZENS

15:54.790 --> 15:56.229
TO STAY INDOORS

15:56.230 --> 15:58.005
DUE TO A GIANT BEAST

15:58.006 --> 15:59.948
RAMPAGING
THROUGH THE CITY.

15:59.949 --> 16:02.595
WELLL, THAT EXPLAINS
THE EMPTY STREETS.

16:02.596 --> 16:03.701
THE GOOD NEWS?

16:03.702 --> 16:05.041
AT LEAST IT'S NOT

16:05.042 --> 16:07.922
TRYING TO CLIMB
ANY TALL BUILDINGS.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.905
THAT CREATURE'S
GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:12.078 --> 16:14.088
WHAT'S THAT?

16:16.937 --> 16:19.783
SOMETHING TELLS ME
I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

16:23.471 --> 16:25.647
IF MY
CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT,

16:25.648 --> 16:29.667
THE ATOMIC ENERGY LAB
SHOULD BE RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

16:29.668 --> 16:31.175
BINGO.

16:31.176 --> 16:34.359
A MOST UNUSUAL WAY
TO GET INTO COLLEGE.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.565
LET'S JUST SAY

16:35.566 --> 16:37.542
I WORKED MY WAY UP
FROM THE BOTTOM.

16:37.543 --> 16:38.881
WE MUST HURRY.

16:38.882 --> 16:40.557
THERE'S MUCH
WORK TO BE DONE.

16:40.558 --> 16:43.070
Rapheal: WE STILL HAVEN'T
SEEN HIDE NOR HAIR

16:43.071 --> 16:45.080
OF THAT MUTAGEN MONSTER.

16:45.081 --> 16:47.123
YEAH, OR AS I PREFER
TO THINK OF IT,

16:47.124 --> 16:50.139
THE "MOO-TAGEN" MONSTER.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.786
NOW REMEMBER
WHAT MASTER
SPLINTER SAID.

16:52.787 --> 16:55.165
WE'VE GOT TO THINK
LIKE THE ENEMY.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.979
OK, IF YOU
WERE A GIANT BULL,

16:57.980 --> 17:01.297
WHERE WOULD YOU BE?

17:06.992 --> 17:10.108
A GIANT CHINA SHOP,
WHERE ELSE?

17:10.108 --> 17:14.464
OK, FELLAS,
IT'S TIME FOR
THE LAST ROUNDUP.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.540
I SURE
CAN RESONATE

17:16.541 --> 17:19.054
TO THAT LINGO,
PARD-NER.

17:25.454 --> 17:28.268
I HATE IT WHEN HE
SHOWS OFF LIKE THAT.

17:29.308 --> 17:31.719
WHOA. WHAT'S
GOING DOWN, DUDE?

17:31.720 --> 17:33.629
I AM.

17:44.251 --> 17:45.690
GEE, BOSS.

17:45.691 --> 17:48.539
THIS PLACE HAS
SURE BEEN WRECKED.

17:48.540 --> 17:51.387
YEAH. UDDER-LY.

17:51.388 --> 17:54.469
BUT THE MUTAGEN MONSTER
HAS ELUDED US!

17:54.470 --> 17:59.160
QUICKLY, BACK
INTO THE MODULE.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.639
HE'S GETTING AWAY.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.348
WE'LL DEAL
WITH HIM LATER.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.062
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT
A CRAZED COW TO CATCH.

18:06.063 --> 18:08.642
THERE...

18:08.643 --> 18:12.227
NOW IT'S
A PERFECTLY MATCHED SET.

18:12.228 --> 18:14.907
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:14.908 --> 18:17.320
WE GOTTA DRIVE SOME CATTLE
TOWARD THE UNIVERSITY.

18:17.321 --> 18:19.229
APRIL, WE'LL TAKE
THE POINT,

18:19.230 --> 18:21.575
AND YOU
CAN RIDE CABOOSE.

18:21.576 --> 18:23.853
THANKS A WHOLE BUNCH.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.299
COWABUNGA!

18:26.300 --> 18:28.644
WITH THE ACCENT
ON "COW."

18:35.480 --> 18:37.155
THIS GIG

18:37.156 --> 18:39.399
IS TOTALLY
NUTSOID, DUDES.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.281
YEAH, THAT'S THE MOST
UNBELIEVABLE THING
I'VE EVER HERDED.

18:48.782 --> 18:50.389
WHERE'S THE BEEF?

18:50.390 --> 18:51.830
OH, THERE IT IS.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.511
THEY REALLY OUGHTA
TRIM THESE HEDGES.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.717
WE JUST DID.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.593
DONATELLO, IT'S US.

18:57.594 --> 18:58.933
OPEN THE DOOR.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.632
NO ONE CAN RESIST
THE SHREDDER,

19:11.633 --> 19:14.714
AND NO COW
CAN RESIST SALT.

19:21.215 --> 19:22.721
GOTCHA!

19:24.499 --> 19:27.546
YOU TURTLES ARE
TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE.

19:27.547 --> 19:30.294
I CONTROL
THE MUTAGEN MONSTER NOW.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.003
HEY, GUYS,

19:32.004 --> 19:34.247
I'M HERE TO HELP.

19:34.248 --> 19:35.956
DON'T WORRY, BOSS.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.464
I GOT IT.

19:37.465 --> 19:39.709
NOW HOW DO YOU
WORK THIS THING?

19:39.710 --> 19:42.590
NO. NO, YOU IDIOT.
NOT THAT WAY.

19:47.818 --> 19:50.799
IT'S HEADED THIS WAY,
MASTER. RUN.

19:55.390 --> 19:57.634
I HAVE TO SWITCH ON
THE ATOM SMASHER.

19:57.635 --> 19:59.410
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

19:59.411 --> 20:01.722
YOU'LL NEVER GET PAST
THAT ENRAGED BEAST.

20:01.723 --> 20:03.832
NO PROBLEMO, DUDE.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.943
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

20:14.220 --> 20:17.235
OOH,
THIS IS PRETTY.

20:17.236 --> 20:19.345
DON'T JUST
STAND THERE GAWKING.

20:19.346 --> 20:20.786
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.975
CAN'T WE JUST STAY
FOR THE FIREWORKS?

20:24.976 --> 20:28.593
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME FIREWORKS.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.737
SHREDDER
IS GETTING AWAY!

20:30.738 --> 20:32.245
FORGET SHREDDER.

20:32.246 --> 20:34.390
MICHELANGELO IS
TRAPPED IN THERE.

20:34.391 --> 20:35.395
I'LL GET HIM.

20:39.785 --> 20:41.794
MICHELANGELO,
WHERE ARE YOU?

20:41.795 --> 20:43.168
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:47.290 --> 20:49.634
WELL, AT LEAST
IT WORKED.

20:49.635 --> 20:52.012
BUT WHERE
IS MICHELANGELO?

20:53.823 --> 20:56.737
GET ALONG,
LITTLE DOGGIE DUDES.

20:56.738 --> 20:59.652
MICHELANGELO,
!

20:59.653 --> 21:03.404
YEP. I SURE AM,
LITTLE LADY.

21:03.405 --> 21:07.124
WHY, YOU MUST BE
THE NEW SCHOOLMARM, HUH?

21:07.125 --> 21:10.207
AND THAT IS THE END
OF THE MUTAGEN MONSTER.

21:10.208 --> 21:13.423
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR US
TO MOSEY ON BACK

21:13.424 --> 21:15.567
TO THE OLD
SEWER SLUDGE CORRAL.

21:15.568 --> 21:17.108
IT'S A PITY
YOU FELLAS CAN'T

21:17.109 --> 21:18.616
ADOPT ONE
OF THESE STEERS

21:18.617 --> 21:20.191
AND START
YOUR OWN RANCH.

21:20.192 --> 21:21.632
RIGHT.

21:21.633 --> 21:23.307
A DUDE RANCH.

21:27.998 --> 21:30.242
I'VE JUST BEEN
COW-LICKED.

21:30.243 --> 21:31.850
DON'T KNOCK IT, APRIL.

21:31.851 --> 21:34.531
THE SPIKED LOOK
IS REALLY IN.
