Matsuda of Touto News.

00:34.083 --> 00:36.833
The public's attention
has been drawn by recent rumors

00:36.916 --> 00:39.625
of an incumbent minister
receiving payments

00:39.708 --> 00:42.541
in return for doing favors
for a certain construction company.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.541
Keep your questions brief.

00:44.625 --> 00:47.750
The minister contends
that his secretary did it.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.208
Are you sure it wasn't done
on the minister's orders?

00:51.291 --> 00:52.875
Please get to the point.

00:52.958 --> 00:56.333
The prime minister cannot avoid
being held indirectly responsible.

00:56.416 --> 00:58.250
What is the government's position on this?

00:58.333 --> 01:01.416
That is for the prime minister to decide.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.250
FREEDOM OF PRESS DETERIORATES

01:17.083 --> 01:18.125

01:29.458 --> 01:31.833
Suspect has just left the gate.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.000
Suspect passing position C now.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.000
Matsuda of Touto News.

02:13.083 --> 02:17.250
I'd like to ask another question
related to corruption in politics.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.291
It was recently revealed

02:19.375 --> 02:22.125
there was a misuse of funds from
the 2011 Earthquake Recovery Package.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.250
Keep your questions brief.

02:24.333 --> 02:26.333

JUNE 2017: LECTURE AND TOUR BY FIRST LADY

02:42.291 --> 02:43.416
The First Lady's thoughts?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.833
She'd like it to go ahead officially.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.083
She knows the waste issue
still hasn't been resolved.

02:49.166 --> 02:54.041
But she says herself that the size
and suitability of the site is perfect.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.416
I'll need some time.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.291
I'll run this past
the Chubu Local Finance Bureau.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.833
Director-General,
please have a look at this.

03:06.958 --> 03:08.166
SHINICHI MURAKAMI

03:24.375 --> 03:25.625
What's this?

03:25.708 --> 03:28.458
Please consider it
a priority for your office.

03:29.166 --> 03:31.208
DEDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY
1.222 BILLION YEN

03:31.291 --> 03:34.208
Surely, this deduction is far too much.

03:35.541 --> 03:37.125
It's the prime minister's wish.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.166
Suspect soon arriving
at the target location.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.958
-Yes?
<i>-The arrest of Toyoda was called off.</i>

03:48.041 --> 03:48.916
What?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.291
It was reported
that large contributions were paid

03:51.375 --> 03:54.416
by a corporation
that benefited from the project.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.291
What is the government's response?

03:56.375 --> 03:58.916
That is currently under investigation.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.333
The next question will be the last.

04:02.708 --> 04:03.875
Matsuda of Touto News.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.875
What? Why now?

04:05.958 --> 04:08.875
<i>At any rate,</i>
<i>do as you're ordered. Understand?</i>

04:10.916 --> 04:12.375
-We're moving in.
-Wait.

04:13.625 --> 04:16.500
-The arrest was called off.
-Why? He'll get away!

04:16.583 --> 04:19.208
How should I know?
The brass said to let him go.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.541
Let him go?
This is a ten-billion-yen fraud case!

04:24.416 --> 04:25.916
I appreciate your cooperation.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.416
<i>Matsuda of Touto News.</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:39.125
So I can assume that the results
of the investigation will be made public?

04:39.208 --> 04:42.625
Rather than just releasing information
favorable to the government,

04:42.708 --> 04:45.666
I'd like to see
impartial information released.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.833
This press conference
is not for you to air your opinions.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.416
I'm back.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.125
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.041
-Thanks.
-Ryo.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.583
-Yes?
-Look at this.

07:21.666 --> 07:23.250
Another case of corruption.

07:23.333 --> 07:25.166
They said he took bribes.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.166
-Oh, I see.
-Is that any way to react?

07:28.250 --> 07:30.833
You'll start job hunting soon, you know.

07:30.916 --> 07:33.708
Start showing some interest
in social issues.

07:33.791 --> 07:37.708
The future depends on you guys,
the young people.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.125
Give me a break. That's asking too much.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.875
Asking too much?

07:41.958 --> 07:44.291
You've at least got to read the paper.

07:45.291 --> 07:48.041
Not a single young person
nowadays reads the paper.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.250
We've got smartphones.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.416
That's the trouble
with young people nowadays.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.916
Don't be ridiculous.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.958
You can do anything
with smartphones nowadays.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.000
Exactly.

07:59.083 --> 08:00.375
-Right?
-What?

08:00.875 --> 08:02.583
-See?
-I'm back.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.541
-Hi.
-Welcome back.

08:04.625 --> 08:07.333
-Good morning.
-Can you believe this, Mayu?

08:07.833 --> 08:11.166
Ryo doesn't read the paper
even though he works here.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.583
Really?

08:14.666 --> 08:16.750
What? You read it?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.291
You'd better believe it.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.208
How can you deliver it every day
and not be interested in it?

08:21.291 --> 08:24.708
But nobody I know reads it.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.458
Who cares what other people do?

08:26.958 --> 08:30.166
It's a waste of time to deliver newspapers
without knowing what's in them.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.208
Well put!

08:33.291 --> 08:36.125
-Be more like Mayu.
-That was a nice scolding.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.208
-I'm leaving.
-Are you mad, Ryo?

08:39.291 --> 08:40.291
No, I'm not.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.291
-Here. Have a tangerine.
-Thank you.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.125
-Are you mad?
-No, I'm not mad. Bye.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.875
Don't get mad.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.916
Mr. Toyoda. Anna Matsuda of Touto News.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.583
May I have a moment?

10:03.458 --> 10:04.583
You again?

10:04.666 --> 10:06.333
I told you I have nothing more to say.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.291
The allegations haven't been cleared.

10:10.916 --> 10:12.958
As a special advisor to the Cabinet,

10:13.041 --> 10:15.791
you were deeply involved in
AI tech development, weren't you?

10:16.791 --> 10:19.916
The Ministry of Economy
provided unusually large subsidies for it.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.375
Were you aware of this?

10:23.500 --> 10:26.291
There's even a report
that an arrest warrant has been issued.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.083
Answer me.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.208
When will you stop covering dead stories?

10:36.750 --> 10:38.916
You shouldn't let
feelings affect your work.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.416
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.333
CITY DESK, TOUTO NEWS

10:52.416 --> 10:54.833
-Ms. Matsuda. Good morning.
-Good morning.

10:54.916 --> 10:57.708
Ms. Matsuda, did you read
the local news in the <i>Maicho</i>?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.125
Not yet. Is something there?

10:59.875 --> 11:01.041
This was there.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.666
"Public land sold cheap. Links to PM?"

11:09.625 --> 11:13.041
FIRST LADY NAMED HONORARY PRINCIPAL

11:13.875 --> 11:16.791
Everyone. Gather round.

11:20.708 --> 11:22.833
-You read the <i>Maicho </i>article, right?
-Yes.

11:24.416 --> 11:28.041
This here. It became an issue
because the Chubu Local Finance Bureau

11:28.125 --> 11:31.541
didn't disclose the price
that this public land was sold at.

11:32.666 --> 11:36.416
This means that public land
that had gone unsold for ages

11:36.500 --> 11:40.541
was sold for a discount
at the direction of the First Lady?

11:40.625 --> 11:43.666
-Right.
-Usually, it's unheard of to sell

11:43.750 --> 11:46.333
at one-tenth the appraised value.
Why did they do that?

11:46.958 --> 11:49.625
Obviously, they'd sell it
at one-tenth the price.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.625
What?

11:51.708 --> 11:52.875
PUBLIC LAND SOLD CHEAP
LINKS TO PM?

11:52.958 --> 11:54.333
They're friends.

11:56.375 --> 11:59.125
We'll pursue this story too.
Matsuda, you'll do it, right?

12:00.416 --> 12:02.625
I'm still working on
the Toyoda fraud case.

12:03.416 --> 12:05.666
I'd like you to take a break
from that for a while.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.208
No point in pursuing
an unpublishable story.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.416
Sato and Yashiro, you assist.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.958
I'm counting on you. Got it?

12:15.041 --> 12:16.041
-Yes, sir.
-Got it.

12:18.791 --> 12:22.291
If this turns out to be true,
that's a huge breach of trust.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.666
I mean, what are they
even building a school for?

12:25.166 --> 12:28.416
Since it's obviously a cover-up,
how will they explain it away?

12:29.875 --> 12:32.208
They've got people
who will handle it for them.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.000
Come in.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.208
Excuse me.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.250
-Murakami.
-Yes?

13:03.208 --> 13:04.375
This Eishin Academy affairâ€¦

13:05.000 --> 13:07.625
Were you the one who instructed
the Ministry of Finance?

13:08.833 --> 13:09.916
Yes.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.125
OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL ADVISOR
TO THE PRIME MINISTER

13:14.208 --> 13:15.833
This has created some trouble.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.833
This is sure to cause the press
and opposition to pressure us.

13:19.916 --> 13:23.000
-I'm sorry.
-No. It's not your fault.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.541
You were only doing what you were told.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.083
However,

13:29.750 --> 13:33.291
this is sure to become a thorn
in the side of this administration.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.500
What's important is to make sure
this doesn't become a bigger issue.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.875
Yes, I understand that.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.708
I'll contact the Ministry of Finance too.

13:43.291 --> 13:46.958
If the press happen to ask you
anything about it, don't talk to them.

13:48.750 --> 13:49.583
I won't.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.125
Excuse me.

14:03.125 --> 14:08.666
NAGOYA, AICHI PREFECTURE

14:12.291 --> 14:16.166
MAIN OFFICE, CHUBU LOCAL FINANCE BUREAU

14:21.666 --> 14:25.375
I'm Kazuya Suzuki.
I was assigned here starting today.

14:26.708 --> 14:30.750
Before, I worked with Supervisor Kurosaki
at the Shizuoka Local Finance Office.

14:30.833 --> 14:34.208
I will make use of my experience
to fulfill my duties

14:34.291 --> 14:36.833
here at the Chubu Local Finance Bureau.

14:41.833 --> 14:45.250
He's a hard-working and talented guy.
Give him a warm welcome.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.041
-Yes, sir.
-Nice to meet you.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.416
They're all pretty busy.

14:54.041 --> 14:57.500
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay. I understand the situation.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.666
Your wife must have been shocked
at the sudden transfer.

15:02.166 --> 15:06.458
A bit. But she was happy
when she heard about the benefits.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.458
I see.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.208
Let me give you a quick tour.

15:12.875 --> 15:13.708
Okay.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.583
-Sato.
-Yes?

15:25.666 --> 15:27.958
Can you make a list
of the relevant departments

15:28.041 --> 15:29.375
at the Chubu Local Finance Bureau?

15:29.458 --> 15:30.333
Sure thing.

15:31.083 --> 15:34.625
<i>I guess being so close to the action,</i>
<i>you have unique insights.</i>

15:34.708 --> 15:35.916
<i>That's true.</i>

15:36.000 --> 15:38.750
<i>I really doubt that anyone else</i>
<i>could reveal as much as me.</i>

15:38.833 --> 15:40.708
What's with this guy anyway?

15:41.291 --> 15:45.416
He's an exec at a PR firm
and a special advisor to the Cabinet.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.625
I wonder what he's scheming.

15:49.875 --> 15:54.708
THE DEEP SECRETS OF THE AI FRAUD
A BEHIND-THE-SCENES POLITICAL BROKER

15:54.791 --> 15:57.541
CASE CLOSED
BUT QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED

15:57.625 --> 16:00.958
-He probably wants to be a politician.
-I see.

16:01.041 --> 16:05.666
Ms. Matsuda, you've been chasing
that guy for a long time, haven't you?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.000
You know him?

16:07.083 --> 16:08.041
What?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.500
No.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.083
Really?

16:12.416 --> 16:14.458
I sure hope you get to the bottom

16:14.541 --> 16:16.041
of that AI fraud story.

16:16.125 --> 16:19.291
WHY DID PM'S FRIENDS ESCAPE ARREST?

16:19.375 --> 16:22.875
SECRET HONEYMOON WITH SLT

16:27.125 --> 16:31.000
We areÂ Singularity Lab Technologies
or SLT.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.458
Let me explain what our name means.

16:33.541 --> 16:35.750
Technological singularity

16:35.833 --> 16:38.875
is when technological advances
outpace human evolution.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.166
So our companyâ€¦

16:40.250 --> 16:42.500
I am totally exhausted.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.583
I guess this is what it means
to be an adult.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.375
-What are you on about?
-It just feels weird.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.250
Everyone's dressed the same way.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.875
Since you deliver newspapers,
I thought you were the type

16:56.958 --> 16:58.666
who's into this kind of thing.

16:58.750 --> 17:02.375
Hardly. I only do it because I have to
for the scholarship money.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.458
-Is that right?
-I don't even read it.

17:04.541 --> 17:08.125
Seriously? Talk about uninformed!
You're supposed to be job hunting.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.250
Can't I just read it online?

17:10.333 --> 17:13.958
No way. That stuff's no good.
The Internet is nothing but fake news.

17:14.041 --> 17:15.666
Talk about socially illiterate.

17:16.958 --> 17:19.208
You sure have changed.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.875
In your freshman year,
all you did was talk about girls.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.291
Well, now I'm prepping to join
the ranks of adult society.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.208
What does that even mean?

17:28.291 --> 17:30.583
-Let's go to a cafÃ©.
-A cafÃ©?

17:31.583 --> 17:32.541
Here's a great one.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.250
<i>Masato Ono.</i>

17:36.375 --> 17:39.833
<i>Prime Minister, you said</i>
<i>it doesn't concern you and brushed it off,</i>

<i>but your name and the First Lady's name</i>

17:43.208 --> 17:44.958

17:45.041 --> 17:48.041
<i>to the establishment</i>

17:50.541 --> 17:53.708
<i>I highly doubt the public will be</i>

ASSISTANT TO THE FIRST LADY

17:56.083 --> 17:57.041
<i>Prime Minister!</i>

17:59.083 --> 18:03.416

<i>that you had influence in this matter?</i>

18:10.416 --> 18:12.625
<i>I can definitively state</i>

18:12.708 --> 18:16.333
<i>that there is absolutely no truth</i>
<i>to the claims that I was involved in</i>

18:16.416 --> 18:19.083
<i>the sale of the land</i>
<i>or the approval of the sale.</i>

18:21.333 --> 18:25.083
<i>If I or my wife were involved</i>
<i>in this in any way,</i>

18:25.833 --> 18:28.125
<i>then of course</i>

18:28.208 --> 18:35.166
<i>I will step down as prime minister</i>
<i>and resign from the National Diet.</i>

18:35.250 --> 18:36.708
<i>Well said, Prime Minister!</i>

18:38.416 --> 18:39.708
KITAMURA

18:40.458 --> 18:41.625
Hello?

18:41.708 --> 18:44.041
Hi. Did you hear what the PM said?

18:44.125 --> 18:46.375
-Yes.
<i>-What do you think?</i>

18:49.125 --> 18:53.875
That last part, he clearly ignored
the statement that was prepared for him.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.916
I think he was speaking
using his own words.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.916
If he turns out to be lying,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.166
this could cause
his administration's downfall.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.500
That's right.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.750
I need to finish some research
here in Tokyo.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.791
But after that, I'll travel to Nagoya

19:12.875 --> 19:15.875
and get info from those close
to the Chubu Local Finance Bureau.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.458
<i>Got it.</i>

19:18.166 --> 19:20.125
Goodbye.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.458
I wasn't expecting that.

19:30.541 --> 19:33.375
I wish he'd stick to the script.

19:35.166 --> 19:40.333
At any rate,
put a muzzle on everyone involved.

19:40.416 --> 19:42.041
We can't have them talk about this.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.250
Certainly.
I'll take care of it right away.

19:46.791 --> 19:49.083
-Murakami.
-Yes?

19:53.083 --> 19:57.333
I doubt we can keep what
the Ministry of Finance knows under wraps.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.041
Right.

20:02.541 --> 20:05.583
I want you to tell Finance Bureau
Director-General Mouri about this.

20:05.666 --> 20:06.708
Yes, sir.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.375
The Prime Minister's Office
has had nothing to do with this affair.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.708
But I negotiated the deal
with the Ministry of Finance.

20:21.791 --> 20:22.625
I know that!

20:25.583 --> 20:27.500
I know, butâ€¦

20:30.041 --> 20:34.875
if we don't make his statements the truth,
the problem will only grow larger.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.291
I'm counting on you.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.125
I'm home.

20:52.958 --> 20:53.958
Welcome home.

20:55.583 --> 20:59.083
I'm home. What a nice smell!

20:59.166 --> 21:01.416
It's not quite ready.
Why don't you take a bath first?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.375
I'm starving. I'd rather eat first.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.666
Fine. Hold on a minute.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.291
Is Mr. Kurosaki doing well?

21:11.375 --> 21:13.750
Yes. The same as ever.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.208
He's a veteran I can always rely on.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.041
I'm glad to hear it.

21:19.625 --> 21:22.166
But don't push yourself
too hard and overdo it.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.166
You bet I'll push myself.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.958
We national civil servants
work for the people of this country.

21:28.041 --> 21:30.333
We need to work the hardest
during hard days.

21:31.375 --> 21:35.333
You have always been
proud of doing your utmost for the people.

21:35.416 --> 21:36.541
That's right.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.333
It's Mr. Kurosaki.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.208
Hello?

21:44.583 --> 21:47.833
Yes, it's okay. What is it?

21:49.708 --> 21:50.666
Okay.

21:52.000 --> 21:52.833
Okay.

21:54.291 --> 21:55.291
Now?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.500
No, it's all right.

21:59.416 --> 22:03.375
All right. Okay, bye.

22:05.916 --> 22:09.833
I'm sorry, Mayumi.
He wants me back there immediately.

22:09.916 --> 22:11.500
Really? Now?

22:11.583 --> 22:16.208
Yes. But since it's Mr. Kurosaki asking,
I should go.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.958
Okay. Tell Mr. Kurosaki I said hello.

22:20.041 --> 22:20.958
Sure.

22:25.125 --> 22:27.583
-Take care.
-I'll be home soon.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.583
Mr. Kurosaki. Good evening.

22:49.916 --> 22:52.125
Sorry to call you here so suddenly.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.375
It's okay. What is it?

22:56.291 --> 22:59.625
There have been some problems.

23:02.458 --> 23:06.333
Does this have something to do
with that public land?

23:08.958 --> 23:10.583
Here. Follow me.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.208
Good evening.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.083
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

23:52.666 --> 23:53.500
This way, please.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.166
This is Finance Bureau
Director-General Mouri.

24:06.291 --> 24:07.375
Sit.

24:16.125 --> 24:21.041
Since he's come all the way from Tokyo,
you must realize how important this is.

24:23.333 --> 24:27.291
Everyone, you're all aware
of the Eishin Academy affair, right?

24:29.916 --> 24:31.416
-Yes.
-Good.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.291
The prime minister is busy
with his official duties,

24:36.375 --> 24:40.500
so to be honest, he hasn't had time
to familiarize himself with the facts.

24:43.500 --> 24:47.791
There are some records here
whose existence is rather awkward.

24:48.666 --> 24:51.250
They don't match what was said
in parliamentary questions.

24:54.958 --> 24:58.750
Excuse me. I'm not sure
I understand what you're saying.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.250
The records must be revised

25:04.333 --> 25:06.375
to match what was said
in parliamentary question time.

25:12.416 --> 25:15.833
Mr. Kurosaki will give you
detailed instructions.

25:21.666 --> 25:23.958
Thank you. Good night.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.833
Mr. Kurosaki.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.208
Did he just order us to

25:46.708 --> 25:49.875
fabricate documents?

26:10.958 --> 26:11.958
I'm home.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.583
Welcome back. What did Mr. Kurosaki want?

26:17.916 --> 26:20.791
It's not that big of a deal.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.750
You must want dinner.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.958
No, it's okay.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.833
-I'll take a bath.
-Okay.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.041
What are you drawing, Hayato? Show me.

26:48.125 --> 26:51.166
<i>-Look, Daddy. I can draw this now.</i>
-Let me see.

26:51.916 --> 26:54.166
That's amazing, Hayato!

26:54.250 --> 26:56.416
<i>I can draw that, too, you know.</i>

26:56.916 --> 26:57.916
<i>Look.</i>

26:59.250 --> 27:01.291
Yes. You're a good artist too.

27:02.416 --> 27:04.458
<i>-Yay!</i>
<i>-Will you need dinner tonight?</i>

27:04.541 --> 27:07.458
I'll be home late,
so it's all right. Thank you.

27:07.541 --> 27:08.666
<i>Okay.</i>

27:09.833 --> 27:11.750
<i>-Shinichi.</i>
-Yes?

27:11.833 --> 27:15.291
<i>I saw the news on TV today</i>
<i>about that academy. Are things all right?</i>

27:15.375 --> 27:19.041
That? No problem at all.
The press is just making a fuss over it.

27:19.541 --> 27:20.625
<i>I'm glad to hear it.</i>

27:20.708 --> 27:23.666
<i>The other mothers at school</i>
<i>love that kind of gossip.</i>

27:23.750 --> 27:25.958
<i>I didn't want them asking me about it.</i>

27:26.041 --> 27:27.208
I told you, it's fine.

27:27.291 --> 27:29.500
Just ignore them when they ask.

27:29.583 --> 27:32.375
<i>-You know I can't do that.</i>
<i>-No!</i>

27:32.458 --> 27:35.791
<i>Hey, you two! Cut that out!</i>

27:35.875 --> 27:38.791
<i>No fighting. What? This?</i>

27:38.875 --> 27:40.208
<i>You're fighting over this?</i>

27:43.041 --> 27:45.708
-I've got to get back to work.
<i>-Okay.</i>

27:45.791 --> 27:48.000
-Sleep well. Good night.
<i>-Daddy's got to go. Bye.</i>

27:48.666 --> 27:50.458

27:55.833 --> 27:58.875

-I'm Anna Matsuda from Touto News.

27:58.958 --> 28:00.250
Can I have a moment of your time?

28:00.333 --> 28:02.541
I don't have anything to say.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.083
It's about the Eishin Academy affair.

28:05.625 --> 28:09.541
Wasn't the PM's statement to the Diet
the other day an unexpected one for you?

28:09.625 --> 28:10.750
Hold on here.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.583
On what grounds
can you make a claim like that?

28:15.208 --> 28:17.875
It's been indicated
that the First Lady was involved.

28:17.958 --> 28:19.708
Excuse me, but I need to go.

29:07.625 --> 29:09.666
-Mr. Sato.
-Yes?

29:10.416 --> 29:13.041
What do you think of Ms. Matsuda?

29:13.708 --> 29:14.958
Why do you ask?

29:15.041 --> 29:16.291
She's not on the politics desk,

29:16.375 --> 29:20.250
but she asks questions
at the PM's press conferences.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.166
And she doesn't give a darn
when people bash her online.

29:23.666 --> 29:26.000
I could never put up with that stuff.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.208
She's a tough woman psychologically.

29:28.291 --> 29:31.958
<i>She's got tons of enemies,</i>
<i>but she's serious about her work.</i>

29:32.041 --> 29:33.875
<i>I end up doing what she asks me to do.</i>

29:33.958 --> 29:36.000
<i>Yes, I know what you mean.</i>

29:36.083 --> 29:41.041

she was like a different person.

30:27.875 --> 30:29.291
Ryo, you look dead inside.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.250
Cut it out. I've always looked like this.

30:33.500 --> 30:36.250
So, Ryo, are you job hunting?

30:36.750 --> 30:37.583
Yes.

30:38.708 --> 30:41.833
-Basically.
-What is that supposed to mean?

30:41.916 --> 30:43.375
Set goals for yourself, would you?

30:44.250 --> 30:46.083
Yes, I know.

30:47.208 --> 30:48.916
I don't really have any goals.

30:49.833 --> 30:54.666

we start out at a disadvantage, you know.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.125

go over all the headlines once.

31:25.083 --> 31:28.541
Then read the articles
that interest you carefully.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.708
Really?

31:33.625 --> 31:34.500
What's this?

36:33.583 --> 36:38.541
<i>When the opposition comments on</i>
<i>what the Eishin Academy's curriculum is</i>

36:39.083 --> 36:43.958
<i>or says the school superintendent</i>
<i>is to blame, they're missing the point.</i>

36:44.625 --> 36:46.416
<i>That's not the problem.</i>

36:46.500 --> 36:49.708
<i>The problem is</i>
<i>what the school was trying to achieve</i>

36:50.208 --> 36:55.041
<i>by using the names</i>
<i>of the prime minister and the First Lady.</i>

36:56.333 --> 36:58.125
<i>-Personallyâ€¦</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

36:58.750 --> 37:02.708
<i>Well, I have a close relationship with</i>
<i>the prime minister and the First Lady.</i>

37:02.791 --> 37:04.333
<i>I know the kind of people they are.</i>

37:05.291 --> 37:06.125
<i>They're good people.</i>

37:07.125 --> 37:11.916
<i>I can't help thinking thatÂ Eishin Academy</i>
<i>is taking advantage of their kind natureâ€¦</i>

37:19.625 --> 37:21.416
<i>In other words, it's not an issue</i>

37:21.500 --> 37:24.041
<i>with the PM</i>
<i>or the First Lady, but with Eishin.</i>

37:24.125 --> 37:25.375
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

37:26.291 --> 37:30.416
<i>I understand that as</i>
<i>a former special advisor to the Cabinet,</i>

37:30.500 --> 37:33.791
<i>you have an up-close view of</i>
<i>the prime minister and would think that.</i>

37:34.333 --> 37:36.708
<i>I don't feel I'm bringing</i>
<i>my personal feelings into this.</i>

37:38.250 --> 37:40.291
<i>There hasn't been any proof, right?</i>

37:42.500 --> 37:46.500
<i>I think it's a waste of taxpayer's money</i>
<i>to continue investigating this.</i>

38:00.333 --> 38:02.416

Hello?

39:25.458 --> 39:27.000
Got it. I'll be right there.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.541
<i>This is a question</i>
<i>a lot of our citizens have.</i>

39:31.541 --> 39:34.500
<i>Shouldn't the prime minister</i>
<i>himself head an investigation</i>

39:34.583 --> 39:37.750
<i>looking into</i>
<i>why this kind of thing has happened?</i>

39:37.833 --> 39:40.916
<i>-That's right!</i>

<i>It's exactly as</i>
<i>the Minister of Finance just said.</i>

Are you sure
you haven't been followed by reporters?

40:05.375 --> 40:06.208
No, I haven't.

40:08.708 --> 40:11.791

40:13.666 --> 40:16.958

To be on the safe side,

40:32.250 --> 40:35.458
I'd like you to keep a low profile
for the time being.

40:37.875 --> 40:39.416
You are off First Lady duty.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.583
We'll have you do other work.

-10 cc diazepam.
