00:24.248 --> 00:27.589
My heart has
been broken for a long time.

00:27.689 --> 00:29.750
I started to make myself
vulnerable again,

00:29.850 --> 00:32.271
but I'm scared.

00:32.371 --> 00:35.192
How can I trust myself
to make the right decision?

00:35.292 --> 00:37.293
Sincerely, G.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.154
Dear G,

00:41.254 --> 00:43.755
I know that feeling -

00:43.855 --> 00:45.836
when the thing
you're trying to protect

00:45.936 --> 00:48.677
is the same thing
that's aching.

00:48.777 --> 00:50.877
What's the point
of opening yourself up

00:50.977 --> 00:52.978
when it will inevitably
lead to pain and hurt?

00:55.259 --> 00:57.200
But it's better to grow old

00:57.300 --> 01:00.041
and die alone
in a room full of memories

01:00.141 --> 01:04.762
than to lock yourself away
so there's nothing to remember.

01:04.862 --> 01:07.923
Every element of you
was made in a star.

01:08.023 --> 01:10.324
We all burst out
of this darkness,

01:10.424 --> 01:12.885
and in the grand scheme
of things,

01:12.985 --> 01:16.926
we're nothing but a momentary,
meaningless blip.

01:17.026 --> 01:19.967
Your heart
can again be a star -

01:20.067 --> 01:23.529
a living flame
to light the darkness.

01:23.629 --> 01:27.650
We all have the choice to carry
the universe in our heart,

01:27.750 --> 01:29.751
or be crushed by it.

01:32.072 --> 01:35.413
So, G, is the universe
trying to tell you something?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.333
Dad!

01:37.433 --> 01:39.174
And are you ready to listen?

01:39.274 --> 01:40.855
Dad!

01:40.955 --> 01:42.855
You hit someone.

01:42.955 --> 01:44.456
It's just
a coincidence.

01:44.556 --> 01:47.417
What?

01:47.517 --> 01:48.437
It's just a coincidence.

01:48.517 --> 01:50.818
OK!

01:50.918 --> 01:52.919
Doesn't mean anything.
It's just a coincidence.

01:54.039 --> 01:56.040
- Fuck!

02:19.968 --> 02:22.429
Um...

02:22.529 --> 02:25.190
-Everyone's OK?
-I think I am

02:46.537 --> 02:48.538
Oh, shit.

02:53.340 --> 02:59.302
# Oh, ooh

03:02.223 --> 03:07.705
# Oh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh,
ooh-ooh... #

03:23.270 --> 03:27.091
No, no, no! No.

03:34.034 --> 03:36.034
Get out of
my fucking way!

03:39.636 --> 03:41.636
I read Contact.

03:42.277 --> 03:43.937
Five times.

03:44.037 --> 03:46.098
- Wow.
- I liked it.

03:46.198 --> 03:48.199
Obviously.

03:49.399 --> 03:50.980
It's a beautiful story.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.700
That's not even his best one.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.221
What's that?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.321
The one he wrote with his wife.

03:58.482 --> 04:00.663
- What's it called?
- It's not actually a book.

04:00.763 --> 04:03.504
Hey! Hey!
Emma, get away from her!

04:03.604 --> 04:06.465
- Why?
- It is not safe.

04:06.565 --> 04:08.466
What are you talking about?
You're the one who did that.

04:08.566 --> 04:10.106
I am not having this argument
right now with you!

04:10.206 --> 04:12.387
- Hey, hey!
- What's there to argue about?

04:12.487 --> 04:14.488
Hey! Emma, he's right.
I've got to go.

04:20.210 --> 04:21.430
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

04:21.530 --> 04:23.531
Yeah?
Why don't you eat my dick?!

04:24.571 --> 04:26.392
Fucking hell...

04:26.492 --> 04:28.793
- I'll be back. Emma!
- You better be back!

04:28.893 --> 04:30.893
- Or I'll send
the boys to break your legs!
- Emma!

04:33.614 --> 04:36.035
Sorry about the, uh, accident.

04:36.135 --> 04:37.596
It's OK.
Everybody alright in there?

04:37.696 --> 04:40.237
No. No, not really. No.

04:40.337 --> 04:41.637
But at least I didn't
kill any Italian people.

04:41.737 --> 04:43.558
That must be a relief.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.878
- Really is.

04:44.978 --> 04:46.959
- Going somewhere?
- I was.

04:47.059 --> 04:49.120
Mmm. Taking
the chicken with you?

04:49.220 --> 04:52.521
I didn't know
what else to do with it.
Give it a month.

04:52.621 --> 04:54.442
Well, I believe we already
have each other's
insurance information,

04:54.542 --> 04:56.122
- so we'll just...
- I think we do.

04:56.222 --> 04:58.443
Can we... invite Mary
to dinner tonight?

04:58.543 --> 05:00.544
- Why? No.
- No.

05:04.745 --> 05:06.366
I brought red.

05:06.466 --> 05:08.466
Already got one open.

05:14.708 --> 05:16.709
Emma did that.

05:23.472 --> 05:25.412
That's a nice dress.

05:25.512 --> 05:26.733
- Thanks.
- She bought it.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.013
- Yep.
- Today.

05:29.113 --> 05:31.134
- Mm-hm.
- After the accident.

05:31.234 --> 05:33.495
Accidents.

05:33.595 --> 05:35.136
Well, I think you look lovely.

05:35.236 --> 05:37.236
And I'm wearing florals too.

05:39.037 --> 05:40.738
Dad's cooking vegan food.

05:40.838 --> 05:42.538
Oh, um, I'm not hungry.

05:42.638 --> 05:44.639
I ate before I got here.

05:46.119 --> 05:48.620
I'm just kidding.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.981
Hey, Ems,
can you do daddy a favour

05:51.081 --> 05:52.241
and maybe go out to the garden
and pick a little basil for me?

05:52.321 --> 05:54.182
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

05:54.282 --> 05:55.783
Also, maybe some parsley?
A little thyme.

05:55.883 --> 05:57.883
- OK.
- Great.

06:02.765 --> 06:04.626
Did you tell anyone?

06:04.726 --> 06:05.946
What, that you murdered
a poor Italian family?

06:06.046 --> 06:07.947
I never said they were poor.

06:08.047 --> 06:09.988
Circumstantially,
not socio-economically!

06:10.088 --> 06:12.508
Did you tell anyone about me?

06:12.608 --> 06:14.109
- Is that a threat?
- No, it's not a threat.

06:14.209 --> 06:15.870
'Cause it certainly
sounded like a threat.

06:15.970 --> 06:16.730
Well, I could have
eaten you already.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.431
When you came to my house,

06:19.531 --> 06:21.031
I could quite easily have
locked you in the basement.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.792
And you know what?
You look fucking delicious.

06:22.892 --> 06:25.593
That's a joke. I don't want
to harm you or Emma.

06:25.693 --> 06:27.554
That's why
I tried to stay away from you!

06:27.654 --> 06:29.434
Well, you certainly did
a really good job of it.

06:29.534 --> 06:31.115
You're the one
that came to my house.

06:31.215 --> 06:32.715
You're the one
who hit me with your car.

06:32.815 --> 06:35.236
And I only came tonight
because she asked me.

06:35.336 --> 06:37.997
- Let me tell you,
you'll never see me again!
- Good.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.598
Ugh, are you going to
tell anyone?!

06:39.698 --> 06:41.518
No! No.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.479
No, I didn't tell anyone, OK?

06:43.579 --> 06:45.080
Can you please
stop asking me that?

06:45.180 --> 06:46.440
Good, because you have
no fucking idea

06:46.540 --> 06:49.201
how fucked I am if you do.

06:49.301 --> 06:50.221
I have a feeling I might just
know how fucked you would be.

06:50.301 --> 06:51.922
Oh, you really do?

06:52.022 --> 06:54.283
You have no fucking idea
what it's like

06:54.383 --> 06:56.564
to live isolated away from
everyone that you care about.

06:56.664 --> 06:59.845
OK? I never asked you
to see who I was.

06:59.945 --> 07:02.086
- Well, I certainly
didn't ask...

07:02.186 --> 07:03.686
- Hi!
- Hi, baby.

07:03.786 --> 07:05.967
Your table looks amazing.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.248
Great job, baby.
Thank you so much.

07:08.348 --> 07:11.129
I was just saying to your dad
it looks so nice.

07:11.229 --> 07:13.650
Aw.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.730
Help yourself.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.371
Thanks. I will.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.412
Wait, Dad, have you checked it?

07:19.512 --> 07:21.812
Have I checked IT?

07:21.912 --> 07:24.573
If it's vegan.
Most red wines use eggshell.

07:24.673 --> 07:28.455
Eggshell?
Like, from chickens? Hmm.

07:28.555 --> 07:29.975
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.056
I don't mind.

07:31.156 --> 07:32.496
Dad.

07:32.596 --> 07:34.597
It's all good.

07:35.477 --> 07:37.478
To chicken wine.

07:56.244 --> 07:58.245
Mmm.

08:00.406 --> 08:02.346
This is yummy.

08:02.446 --> 08:04.447
Dad's a great cook.

08:09.849 --> 08:11.750
We don't usually eat vegan.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.850
That's what makes it...

08:14.170 --> 08:16.171
..good.

08:19.492 --> 08:22.073
Have you always been vegan?

08:22.173 --> 08:24.314
No, not always.

08:24.414 --> 08:25.514
I still eat meat occasionally.

08:25.614 --> 08:27.615
Why?

08:32.617 --> 08:33.997
Dad said you learnt psychology.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.478
Oh, he did?

08:36.578 --> 08:37.719
She wanted to know something
about you,

08:37.819 --> 08:39.819
so I chose to tell her that.

08:42.820 --> 08:44.761
Do you have any people
that come and see you?

08:44.861 --> 08:46.862
No, they don't.

08:48.742 --> 08:50.323
Yeah.
Um, that would be tricky.

08:50.423 --> 08:53.484
Why?

08:53.584 --> 08:57.005
Uh, just after my degree,
I wasn't...

08:57.105 --> 08:59.606
I wasn't able.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.707
What happened?

09:03.347 --> 09:06.409
Um...

09:06.509 --> 09:09.410
You know, I now get to write
for a much bigger audience,

09:09.510 --> 09:10.770
for websites.

09:10.870 --> 09:13.771
What sort of websites?

09:13.871 --> 09:16.292
Like an advice column that
goes to a bunch of websites.

09:16.392 --> 09:17.893
So I'm still helping people.

09:17.993 --> 09:20.053
- Is that fun?
- Yeah.

09:20.153 --> 09:21.814
It's actually a great way

09:21.914 --> 09:23.014
to get to know
more about yourself.

09:23.114 --> 09:25.115
Mmm.

09:32.117 --> 09:34.118
Did Dad tell you I've been
going to a psychiatrist?

09:35.839 --> 09:37.739
Um...

09:37.839 --> 09:39.840
How are you finding it?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.721
It's OK, I guess.

09:44.562 --> 09:46.562
Is it, um...
Is it helpful?

09:48.803 --> 09:50.744
I still get sad.

09:50.844 --> 09:53.025
Yeah.
Well, we all get sad sometimes.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.666
Um...

09:55.766 --> 09:58.827
- Do you feel safe?
- What do you mean?

09:58.927 --> 10:00.907
Well, do you feel like, um...

10:01.007 --> 10:03.148
You know, you can trust

10:03.248 --> 10:05.709
the person that
you're sharing with?

10:05.809 --> 10:08.310
Like he won't tell anyone
what I'm saying?

10:08.410 --> 10:11.791
No, like, do you trust them, to
be vulnerable in front of them?

10:11.891 --> 10:13.392
Do you feel like you could
talk to them about anything?

10:13.492 --> 10:14.672
She doesn't talk to anyone.

10:14.772 --> 10:16.773
Dad!

10:18.413 --> 10:20.394
Where did you find them?

10:20.494 --> 10:22.035
I don't need advice
on my parenting choices.

10:22.135 --> 10:24.996
She has a degree in psychology.

10:25.096 --> 10:26.876
An undergraduate degree.
Trevor came highly recommended.

10:26.976 --> 10:30.117
Mmm.

10:30.217 --> 10:33.599
Well, maybe it's just not
a good fit for you right now.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.640
He keeps on getting me
to try these different pills.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.200
They don't really
make me feel good.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.521
Right. Yeah.

10:40.621 --> 10:43.202
And sometimes
we have these big feelings

10:43.302 --> 10:45.523
and we don't know
what to do with them.

10:45.623 --> 10:47.523
But if you find
the right person to talk to,

10:47.623 --> 10:50.204
then it can help you
understand them.

10:50.304 --> 10:51.965
Maybe she could lock herself
in a basement

10:52.065 --> 10:53.125
with a bag of meat
and some chickens.

10:53.225 --> 10:54.286
Dad, stop being weird.

10:54.786 --> 10:56.406
You need to feel safe,

10:56.506 --> 10:58.647
so you can be vulnerable.

10:58.747 --> 11:01.168
In the grand scheme of things,
I'm not sure

11:01.268 --> 11:03.129
if you're the right person
to be handing out advice.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.229
- She's trying to help.
- We are all
trying to help, Emma!

11:29.718 --> 11:31.719
Emma?

11:32.679 --> 11:34.680
You can come in.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.321
I just wanted to say goodbye.

11:44.843 --> 11:46.624
My mum gave it to me,

11:46.724 --> 11:50.145
if you think I'm too old
to have one.

11:50.245 --> 11:52.026
I still sleep with
my husband's teddy.

11:52.126 --> 11:54.747
Really?

11:54.847 --> 11:56.847
He died a really long time ago.

11:59.728 --> 12:01.909
Oh, wow!

12:02.009 --> 12:04.830
- I fixed it.
- Huh.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.271
It's better than before.

12:07.371 --> 12:09.372
It's a lot better than
the last time I saw it.

12:12.373 --> 12:15.994
- What's that story?
- What story?

12:16.094 --> 12:18.155
The one about Carl Sagan
that he wrote with his wife.

12:18.255 --> 12:20.035
Yes.
The story of the golden record.

12:20.135 --> 12:22.136
Record?

12:22.236 --> 12:25.577
A vinyl music record,
except made out of gold.

12:26.177 --> 12:28.178
It was shot into space
a really long time ago.

12:31.779 --> 12:35.401
So NASA compiled all these
images and sounds and music,

12:35.501 --> 12:38.642
in case an alien civilisation
ever found it

12:38.742 --> 12:41.043
and tried to work out
who we are.

12:41.143 --> 12:44.884
And it was up to Carl Sagan
to decide what went on it.

12:44.984 --> 12:47.965
So he put pictures of animals
and architecture and food,

12:48.065 --> 12:53.487
and music like Chuck Berry and
Bach and Mozart and Beethoven

12:53.587 --> 12:56.208
and tribal music and electronic
music and classical music.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.529
And there's even
a wedding song from Peru.

12:58.629 --> 13:05.211
But the most important thing
came from his wife, Ann Druyan.

13:05.311 --> 13:07.732
Now, she was on his team,

13:07.832 --> 13:09.893
but they weren't married when
they began working together.

13:09.993 --> 13:12.653
But it's
when they fell in love.

13:12.753 --> 13:16.935
And she found a piece of music
that was 2,000 years old.

13:17.035 --> 13:18.295
And when she rang him up
to tell him,

13:18.395 --> 13:21.176
they got engaged on the phone.

13:21.276 --> 13:22.597
Must have been a pretty amazing
piece of music, huh?

13:22.677 --> 13:25.018
Yeah.

13:25.118 --> 13:27.339
So the next day,
after the phone call,

13:27.439 --> 13:28.859
Ann had an idea
of something else

13:28.959 --> 13:30.740
that should go on the record.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.040
They could measure
the electrical impulses

13:32.120 --> 13:33.461
of a human brain

13:33.561 --> 13:35.341
and turn it into sound.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.702
So Ann meditated,

13:37.802 --> 13:39.383
and they recorded
the sounds of her brain.

13:39.483 --> 13:41.543
And during that meditation,

13:41.643 --> 13:43.624
she thought about
the man she loved,

13:43.724 --> 13:46.025
and now there's a record
of her and Carl's love

13:46.125 --> 13:48.126
echoing its way
across the universe.

13:56.529 --> 13:59.410
My mum told my dad that
she wanted him to be happy.

14:03.011 --> 14:05.952
Before she died of cancer,

14:06.052 --> 14:08.053
she said that she wanted
my dad to find love again.

14:10.854 --> 14:12.854
My aunty told me that.

14:14.295 --> 14:16.035
Do you like talking
to your aunt?

14:16.135 --> 14:18.396
Yeah.

14:18.496 --> 14:20.497
I bet she likes talking to you.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.581
I'm going to leave you now.

14:47.906 --> 14:51.808
Emma, I, uh...

14:51.908 --> 14:54.188
Hey, I wasn't sure
I was going to give you this.

15:01.271 --> 15:03.412
- We don't have a CD player.
- We do in the car.

15:03.512 --> 15:06.413
- We do?
- You never used it.

15:06.513 --> 15:08.513
Listen to track 4. It's
how your dad feels about you.

15:15.116 --> 15:18.657
Hey, sweetie, when, uh, when
did Aunty Sarah tell you that?

15:18.757 --> 15:20.498
- What?
- About what your mom said.

15:20.598 --> 15:23.018
When did she tell you that?

15:23.118 --> 15:25.119
You said that I could
talk to her about anything.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.660
She told me this morning.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.821
Why?

15:30.921 --> 15:32.422
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

15:32.522 --> 15:34.522
To the car.

15:41.645 --> 15:44.066
Hey!

15:44.166 --> 15:46.627
Don't worry,
I'm going for good!

15:46.727 --> 15:48.467
Where?

15:48.567 --> 15:50.568
I haven't worked it out yet.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.469
Do you have any idea

15:54.569 --> 15:57.951
how confusing
this entire situation is?

15:58.051 --> 16:00.111
I mean...

16:00.211 --> 16:02.232
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I felt that

16:02.332 --> 16:05.273
there was a real connection
between the two of us.

16:05.373 --> 16:07.754
And Emma - Emma said
more to you this evening

16:07.854 --> 16:09.855
than she has to anyone in...

16:12.095 --> 16:13.236
But I watched you
eat a live chicken

16:13.336 --> 16:15.337
and an entire goat.

16:17.337 --> 16:19.338
Nobody's perfect.

16:21.979 --> 16:23.920
Uh...

16:24.020 --> 16:26.020
Just...

17:02.212 --> 17:03.033
Gary?

17:03.132 --> 17:04.813
Hey, Sarah.

17:04.913 --> 17:06.574
Is everything OK?

17:06.674 --> 17:08.675
Uh...

17:09.794 --> 17:11.975
What's happened?

17:12.075 --> 17:14.336
Nothing. Nothing.

17:14.437 --> 17:16.457
Um, don't worry.
Everything is fine.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.258
I think.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.419
What are you doing?

17:21.519 --> 17:24.340
I'm just watching
some shitty romance thing.

17:24.439 --> 17:28.622
- Could I ask you a favour?
- Of course.

17:28.722 --> 17:30.722
Could I possibly drop Emma off
at your place, for a bit?

17:32.403 --> 17:34.144
Are you OK?

17:34.244 --> 17:36.464
Yeah.

17:36.564 --> 17:38.564
I just need to
figure something out.

17:39.485 --> 17:42.265
Is she OK?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.789
She's been listening
to the same song on repeat

17:48.889 --> 17:50.629
for the last hour.

17:50.729 --> 17:52.729
What are you talking about?

17:57.292 --> 17:59.292
Gary?

18:34.544 --> 18:36.544
I'm not perfect either.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.867
# Don't care 'bout what you do

19:40.966 --> 19:43.588
# Don't care
'bout what you done

19:43.687 --> 19:46.428
# Don't care 'bout who you knew

19:46.528 --> 19:49.310
# Don't make you anyone

19:49.410 --> 19:52.511
# Don't care how much you got

19:52.611 --> 19:55.191
# Don't care how much you make

19:55.292 --> 19:58.432
# Don't talk
'bout what you're not

19:58.533 --> 20:00.874
# Don't play
the record straight

20:00.974 --> 20:03.035
# No need to put a front

20:03.135 --> 20:06.035
# No need to lay it on

20:06.136 --> 20:09.117
# Say people are too hard,
tryin' to get it

20:09.216 --> 20:12.557
# Tryin' to get it wrong

20:12.658 --> 20:15.479
# You say you got a ride

20:15.579 --> 20:18.200
# You got a stack of bills

20:18.300 --> 20:21.200
# You say you got your pride

20:21.301 --> 20:24.122
# You got your happy pills

20:24.222 --> 20:27.162
# You say you got your gold

20:27.263 --> 20:30.004
# You say you're rich and well

20:30.104 --> 20:32.205
# You say your body's old

20:32.305 --> 20:35.046
# But you got the magic spell

20:35.146 --> 20:37.807
# Well, no need to put a front

20:37.907 --> 20:41.008
# No need to lay it on

20:41.108 --> 20:43.849
# Say people are too hard,
tryin' to get it

20:43.948 --> 20:47.530
# Tryin' to get it wrong

20:47.629 --> 20:50.211
# People are too hard,
tryin' to get it

20:50.311 --> 20:52.312
# Tryin' to get it wrong,
yeah... #
