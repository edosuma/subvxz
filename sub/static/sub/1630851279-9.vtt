WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:02.167
Randy, my family
calls me, Boujetta.

00:02.169 --> 00:04.069
Boujetta? What does that mean?

00:04.071 --> 00:05.170
Very over the top.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.240
I like everything
the way I like it.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.042
- Some of us want
plunging necklines-- - Yes.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.444
And some of us, don't!

00:13.546 --> 00:16.382
I envision her to show
a little skin.

00:16.384 --> 00:21.220
No. My vision and my family's
vision are two different things.

00:21.821 --> 00:24.089
Oh, my God.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.392
My mom needs to love this dress.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.494
What do you think?

00:29.529 --> 00:31.130
I don't like the energy.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.565
I actually really like it.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.400
[Peter laughs]

00:34.402 --> 00:36.001
[sighs] Aww.

00:36.003 --> 00:39.905
As the mother, I am the one who's
gonna have to be the bad cop here.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.573
No, no, nothing's gonna help.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.443
Mom, you've said just enough.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.912
So, take a look.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.014
- Mindy, don't hate me.
- Uh-oh.

00:50.283 --> 00:52.184
I don't like any of them.

01:15.942 --> 01:16.809
I've been at Kleinfeld

01:16.811 --> 01:19.178
for about a month now, training.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.114
Um, but today is my
first appointment.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.816
One-on-one with a bride.

01:23.818 --> 01:27.553
So, I'm really excited, to
hopefully, get my first yes.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.489
You're gonna get me stealing
Lisa's clips. She's gonna kill me.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.193
I don't have my own yet.

01:34.195 --> 01:38.097
Before bridal, I come from the
magical world of musical theater.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.598
[dance music playing]

01:39.600 --> 01:42.701
<i>I went to college for it.
I'm a dancer by trade,</i>

01:42.703 --> 01:44.536
<i>and did a little bit of
costuming here and there too.</i>

01:44.538 --> 01:45.938
<i>Which is, kind of,
how I got into this.</i>

01:47.674 --> 01:51.043
Outside of Kleinfeld, I've worked
in bridal for about three years.

01:51.045 --> 01:55.681
I think it's so magical. I love being able
to be a part of someone's special day,

01:55.683 --> 01:58.984
a part of their journey,
and make these beautiful women

01:58.986 --> 02:01.954
<i>feel even more beautiful than
they do when they walk in the door.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:03.222
So...

02:03.224 --> 02:04.523
I love it.
[chuckles]

02:09.829 --> 02:11.964
Oh, my goodness.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.066
My dream dress will
make me look modern,

02:14.068 --> 02:16.735
and sophisticated, and elegant.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.205
And I think I'll know it's
the one when I feel like,

02:20.207 --> 02:21.540
I can't look
any better than this.

02:22.408 --> 02:23.375
Beads?

02:23.543 --> 02:24.676
Oh!

02:24.678 --> 02:26.778
No, no, no, no.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.148
My mom, Lisa,
is definitely honest,

02:29.150 --> 02:32.751
and she is not afraid to tell
me when something

02:32.753 --> 02:33.986
may not be becoming.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.155
It looks a little like a girdle.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.725
But my future mother-in-law,
Ann is extremely supportive,

02:39.727 --> 02:43.028
and she will definitely be
on my side if my mom is not.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.797
What are we thinking about
something like this?

02:45.799 --> 02:50.302
I mean, I am very happy that
it's not a plunging neckline.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.238
- Okay.
- But the color, to me, seems off.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.108
So, my mom, um...

02:56.110 --> 02:57.442
She's a Virgo.

02:57.444 --> 03:02.948
She has her ideal vision of what
she thinks a bride should look like.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.051
A bride should not look
like she's wearing a negligee,

03:06.053 --> 03:08.487
<i>and I definitely don't
want to look</i>

03:08.721 --> 03:10.322
overly sexual.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.825
But, I love some of these
dresses with plunging necklines

03:13.827 --> 03:14.626
and the long sleeves.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.528
- Hey!
- [Peter] Hi, gorg'.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.864
- [Peter] How are you?
- [Krissy] Are you excited for your first appointment?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.733
Yeah, I'm excited. I hope
I am ready, but... [laughs]

03:21.735 --> 03:24.970
You're ready. You got
this. Now have fun. Whee.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.973
Okay, so, now, why don't you
show me the ones that you like.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.708
- Hi, ladies. How are we doing today?
- [all] Hi.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.076
- Are you Christie?
- Yeah, I'm Christie.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.111
I'm Peter. I'm gonna
be helping you out today.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.179
What are we looking for?

03:34.181 --> 03:36.114
- We want to be modern.
- Okay.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.984
But we want to have
a little classic detail.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.787
Think lace, buttons, appliques.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.022
Something that
really makes people go,

03:44.024 --> 03:45.991
"I wonder where she got that."

03:45.993 --> 03:47.793
- Some of us want plunging necklines...
- Yes.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.795
- [Peter] Mm-hmm.
- And some of us, don't!

03:49.797 --> 03:53.765
And I have to remind you, it's
going to be a church wedding.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.768
Right. So we're going to
have a church ceremony.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.038
So, we're playing with two
ends of the spectrum here, right?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.707
- [Peter laughing]
- Yeah, yeah.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.342
Well, talk to me about
Mr. Man, our fiance.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.043
What does he want to see you in?

04:05.211 --> 04:06.011
What do you think?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.846
I think whatever she wears,

04:07.848 --> 04:10.015
he's just gonna love it
and think she's beautiful.

04:10.950 --> 04:13.919
<i>My fiance is Thomas Hutton.</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:16.154
<i>We met in New York City.</i>

04:16.789 --> 04:18.624
He would say that it's
love at first sight.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.992
He would say that
I was hitting on him.

04:19.994 --> 04:23.195
And I would tell you that
I think he was hitting on me.

04:23.197 --> 04:26.231
<i>We were both so young. Neither
of us really were looking to be</i>

04:26.233 --> 04:28.233
<i>in a committed relationship.</i>

04:28.235 --> 04:31.870
But... something
just kept us together.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.171
Talk to me about budget.

04:33.173 --> 04:36.275
- We would love to be between $3,000 and $5,000.
- Okay.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.110
As long as there's
no plunging neckline?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.878
[all laughing]

04:39.912 --> 04:41.413
Exactly.

04:41.914 --> 04:46.118
My main concern today is that she's
going to love something that I am not.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.887
We've seen
wedding gown disasters,

04:48.889 --> 04:52.691
and we want our daughters
to not have that happen.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.127
Seems like Mom's who
I need to impress here.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.997
- [Peter laughs] - Yeah, she
has so many opinions, and...

04:58.999 --> 05:00.732
um, it will just be
interesting to see

05:00.734 --> 05:03.235
- if her opinions change when the dress is on, you know?
- Yeah.

05:03.237 --> 05:04.703
So, talk to me
a little about silhouette.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.039
- Have we thought about that?
- Yeah.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.675
I love the plunging neckline
and the long sleeves combination.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.010
Awesome. Yeah, so, we can
kind of make Mom happy

05:12.012 --> 05:13.612
- with our modesty right here--
- Yeah!

05:13.614 --> 05:15.280
And we could maybe
get a little bit in there.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.249
Get a little bit fun. I don't
know. We have to see.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.885
We'll see. Yeah, so, I'm
gonna go do a little shopping.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.719
You make yourself comfortable.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.020
You can pop into the robe here.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.556
- Great!
- Awesome, hon. I'll be back in a few minutes.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.824
- All right.
- [Peter chuckles]

05:25.858 --> 05:27.726
My mom needs to love this dress.

05:27.728 --> 05:32.030
If my mom does not love this dress, then
that means there is a huge flop, and...

05:32.032 --> 05:35.867
I'm buckling up, because I know
that as soon as the opinions start,

05:35.869 --> 05:36.568
they are not going to stop.

05:37.437 --> 05:40.238
This is my first idea.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.042
It's really gorgeous. We have
really, kind of, classic detailing here.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.578
Uh-oh, we have got the plunge.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.614
So, let's get it right out of
the way, huh? [chuckles]

05:49.616 --> 05:52.250
You wanna find that area
where the bride feels stunning,

05:52.252 --> 05:54.786
and the bride feels like she's
not compromising anything,

05:54.788 --> 05:57.055
that everyone in the party
in also on her side.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.425
<i>So, it's, you know,
a unicorn to find,</i>

06:00.427 --> 06:03.895
but if you can't find it at
Kleinfeld, where can you?

06:03.897 --> 06:07.432
This is certainly unique,
really classic.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.301
Think I wanna try this.

06:11.604 --> 06:15.006
I... [laughing]

06:16.809 --> 06:19.111
Yes, I do enjoy a
plunging neckline. [laughs]

06:21.714 --> 06:23.148
I went to Catholic school
my whole life.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.984
So, I wore a tie
to school everyday,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.953
and I hate wearing a tied tie.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.922
So, I decided to reclaim it,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.125
and do it my way.
[laughs]

06:35.061 --> 06:37.295
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi!

06:37.297 --> 06:38.897
- [Christie] Uh-oh!
- [Peter] I have some things to look at.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.065
Ooh, yes.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.100
All right, got three different
worlds going on here.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.103
[Christie] Okay, I love what's
happening in the middle.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.405
- [Peter] Yes.
- [Christie] Surprisingly.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.141
- [Peter] Very, kind of, modern clean classic.
- [Christy] Yeah.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.110
- [Peter] But, kind of, offset with this tulle at the bottom.
- [Christie] Yup.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.146
- Let's go for modern first.
- Let's do it.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.148
[Christie] Also,
would I be able to, um,

06:56.150 --> 06:57.783
tell you about
the designers I like?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.284
- 'Cause I have been all over the websites.
- Yes.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.853
- Oh, my God, I would love that.
- Okay, I love Pronovias.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.688
Yes! Okay, Pronovias!

07:03.690 --> 07:05.056
The Byington dress.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.225
- Okay.
- Okay, and there's one other Pronovias' dress

07:07.227 --> 07:09.227
that my mom
and I actually both agreed on,

07:09.229 --> 07:10.629
it was the Lake dress.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.797
It's little more boho.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.532
Do we still wanna try
this first, or do you...

07:13.534 --> 07:16.134
If that's been in your head,
do we wanna try her first?

07:16.169 --> 07:17.169
I don't wanna try it first.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.004
- I feel like I might be overwhelmed.
- Yes.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.806
Let me pop her off for you.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.875
It's not exactly what I
thought I would be trying on,

07:23.877 --> 07:28.980
<i>but it's hitting on the modern
look that I was thinking about.</i>

07:29.916 --> 07:32.050
- Ah, I'm, kind of, stunned.
- [Peter gasps]

07:32.052 --> 07:34.753
- I didn't expect it would look like this.
- Wow!

07:34.755 --> 07:38.123
This is so stunning
and literally...

07:38.125 --> 07:40.058
This is amazing.
We found our shape.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.828
It's not giving me
mermaid 2,000 and...

07:42.830 --> 07:45.297
- No, it's giving me absolute dreams.
- Whatever.

07:45.299 --> 07:48.433
- Yeah. Okay, let's see the butt.
- Yeah.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.036
- Ooh!
- See the gift.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.871
- All right, I love these buttons.
- Wow!

07:52.873 --> 07:55.540
I feel like these buttons
are very bridal.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.243
- Do you wanna go show Mom?
- Yeah, I think this is a, "show her."

07:58.245 --> 07:59.578
- [Peter] I love it.
- [Christie] Okay.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.146
And away we go.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.283
As the mother, I'm one who's
gonna have to be the bad cop here.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.019
Not an easy job, but somebody
has to do it.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.093
Oh, my gosh!

08:15.095 --> 08:16.027
[exclaiming]

08:16.029 --> 08:17.462
Wow!

08:19.165 --> 08:22.133
[Ann] You know, I'm not
always a huge fan of strapless,

08:22.135 --> 08:23.401
but that looks gorgeous on you.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.103
Mom, how did I do?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.040
She's, like,
looking at the butt.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.009
[Lisa] No, no.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.878
- I was-- - [Christie] It
could be a problem area.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.246
[Lisa] No, no, no.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.147
It's lovely.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.049
But it's lacking in...

08:38.551 --> 08:39.518
In...

08:39.520 --> 08:41.319
- Pizzazz?
- A little more detail.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.354
- Details.
- [Christie] Yes.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.889
[Lisa] Right.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.790
<i>[Christie] I think she took the
words out of my mouth when she said,</i>

08:45.792 --> 08:47.025
<i>"There's something missing".</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:49.094
<i>But, it's an encouraging start.</i>

08:49.096 --> 08:50.929
I'm pleasantly surprised.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.031
- Let's get out of that.
- Yeah, all right.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.065
[Peter] Done.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.443
That looks nice, Monique.
You like that one?

09:09.115 --> 09:10.148
No!

09:10.783 --> 09:12.250
I am...

09:12.252 --> 09:14.319
very, very particular.

09:14.887 --> 09:15.654
[Joy] You're picky.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.022
They call me Boujetta,

09:17.024 --> 09:19.724
because my mom says
I'm just a little over the top.

09:19.726 --> 09:24.829
I like everything just extra,
and the way I like it.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.232
Look at this one.
This is so pretty.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.101
- There's a lot going on.
- That's why I love it.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.237
Hello, ladies. I'm looking
for Monique.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.939
[all] Hi!

09:33.941 --> 09:35.307
- How are you?
- I'm Mindy.

09:35.309 --> 09:36.241
Who did you bring
with you, today?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.842
I have my mother, Joy.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.711
And my mother-in-law, Tiffany.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.613
- Hi, Tiffany, nice to meet you, ladies.
- Hi, how are you?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.048
- Nice to meet you too.
- [Mindy] Welcome to Kleinfeld.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.917
Do you have any idea of what
what you're thinking about wearing?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.820
Yes, absolutely.
It's a non-negotiable.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.956
- I want Pantora Bridal.
- [Mindy] Yeah!

09:50.958 --> 09:52.791
I love her silhouettes.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.292
<i>I love the mermaid style.</i>

09:54.294 --> 09:56.661
<i>I love a long train.</i>

09:56.663 --> 09:58.830
And I love off the shoulder.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.132
So, it's actually really great
that you mentioned Pantora,

10:01.134 --> 10:03.368
because she's a brand new
designer for us,

10:03.370 --> 10:06.104
and we're actually having a
trunk show for her right now.

10:06.106 --> 10:10.275
So, I'm really, really excited to, kind
of, explore this collection with you.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.811
Well, Monique, doesn't
really know what's out there.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.212
She's very tunnel-visioned,
just saying.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.280
"This is all I want".

10:15.282 --> 10:16.648
But if she sees something else
and maybe try it on,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.183
she might, she might not.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.518
I envision for her to show
a little skin.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.054
Be a little sexy.

10:23.089 --> 10:26.124
- Okay, how do you feel about that, Monique?
- I don't want it, no.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.259
Usually, it's the opposite.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.062
Usually, the bride wants to show
off more skin, and the mom doesn't.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.098
So, this is really interesting.

10:33.100 --> 10:37.435
My vision and my family's
vision are two different things.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.804
My son does wanna see
a little thigh.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.041
So, something with, maybe, a
split. She doesn't want a split.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.278
But a split isn't hoochie. A split
can be very classy and sexy.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.249
<i>My fiance's name
is Christopher Campbell.</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:55.286
We actually met, um,
reading the Bible App.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.955
<i>I love that he is a man of God.</i>

10:56.957 --> 11:01.159
And we first fell in love
and grew a spiritual bond,

11:01.161 --> 11:04.529
you know, before we ever started,
like, really talking or courting.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.133
So, I know this is
a divine connection,

11:08.135 --> 11:11.536
and our wedding is going
to be in the church.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.539
So, I am not looking forward
to reveal any thigh.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.107
[chuckles]

11:16.275 --> 11:18.043
So, when is the wedding?

11:19.111 --> 11:19.978
[Monique] Three months.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.546
[both] Yes.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.516
- Pressure.
- Okay. Okay, yeah, that's a little...

11:24.518 --> 11:26.551
A little on the closer side.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.853
Not impossible.
You are at Kleinfeld.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.822
Do we have a price point
we wanna keep in mind?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.924
Yeah, anywhere
from 2,000 to 4,000.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.161
Perfect. So, Monique, you're
gonna come on back with me.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.197
You ladies are gonna go ahead
and take a seat over there. Let's do it.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.135
- Hi, Randy.
- Hello, beautiful, how are you?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.538
- I'm doing great, how are you?
- Ugh.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.972
You know, it's renovations,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.808
everything takes twice as long.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.342
<i>But, um, listen,</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:52.677
<i>feels like it's safe to travel,</i>

11:52.711 --> 11:54.946
<i>um, I was, um,</i>

11:54.948 --> 11:57.882
<i>hoping to see if I could book a trunk
show, possibly, with the new collection</i>

11:57.884 --> 11:59.150
Oh, my God, I love that.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.653
I'd really love to get back
to the store in person.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.722
What about the weekend
of the, um,

12:03.724 --> 12:06.291
<i>um, tenth, eleventh, twelfth,
thirteenth? Something like that.</i>

12:06.293 --> 12:08.359
Yeah, I feel like that would
be something that would work.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.261
So, I will pencil in, um,

12:11.030 --> 12:12.130
Kleinfeld,

12:13.165 --> 12:14.199
trunk show,

12:14.467 --> 12:15.867
question mark.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.136
Wonderful, that would be great.
And then I'll try to get on my, um,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.804
you know, my new collection in,

12:19.806 --> 12:21.973
- for that.
- Perfect, I can't wait to see it.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.543
I just got to talk to my contractors
and finalize just a few little things,

12:25.545 --> 12:27.145
<i>then I'll be able to come back.</i>

12:27.147 --> 12:29.447
<i>- Okay?
- Perfect, sounds good to me.</i>

12:29.449 --> 12:30.915
- [Mindy] Alex?
- [Alex] Hi, Mindy.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.784
- [Mindy] Hi, how's it going?
<i>- [Randy] Hey, gorgeous,</i>

12:32.786 --> 12:34.018
<i>- how are you?
- Good to see you.</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:36.721
<i>Good to see you, my love.
What's going on?</i>

12:36.723 --> 12:38.857
So, I actually have
this really amazing bride.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.292
She is really into Pantora.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.628
We just got
some of her new dresses in,

12:43.630 --> 12:45.930
- for the trunk show.
<i>- [Randy] Oh, my gosh!</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:47.165
[Randy] I'd love to see
the new ones, yeah.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.600
Perfect... Let's go.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.635
Back in the, like, '50s,

12:50.637 --> 12:54.139
designers like, Dior, and
whatnot, used to travel around,

12:54.141 --> 12:57.776
<i>and their dresses were shipped
in these big steamer trunks,</i>

12:57.778 --> 12:59.844
and then they'd put the steamer
trunks there. They'd open them up,

12:59.846 --> 13:02.313
and, you know, show
them to the ladies at lunch,

13:02.315 --> 13:03.581
and that would
be called the trunk show.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.283
This...

13:05.818 --> 13:06.918
is incredible.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
Perfect. I'll definitely pull
that one, for sure.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.822
This one too, that has that

13:10.824 --> 13:13.691
clean neckline,
but this train looks...

13:13.693 --> 13:15.894
- out of this world.
- She did mention a long train.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.897
<i>[Randy] Yeah, if she's looking for a long
train, that's definitely a good option.</i>

13:18.899 --> 13:20.231
Fingers crossed.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.867
Okay, and we only have, how
many months, for the wedding?

13:22.869 --> 13:23.935
Wedding's in four months.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.136
Or three months.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.905
Her wedding's in three months.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.175
I think we should be fine
with that delivery date.

13:30.177 --> 13:33.611
Yeah, I know when I do trunk shows,
I always, you know, can rush dresses

13:33.613 --> 13:35.847
more easily,
during a trunk show.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.149
There's a lot of thing you can do
during a trunk show that you can't do

13:38.151 --> 13:39.551
on a normal basis.

13:39.553 --> 13:40.685
<i>And a better
selection of dresses.</i>

13:40.687 --> 13:43.755
So if you find
a designer you like

13:43.757 --> 13:47.158
and you see that they're doing a
trunk show, then you should jump on it.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.093
- Got some dresses for ya.
- Yay.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.562
So take a look.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.096
So I enlisted the help of Randy.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.199
He is with us via video chat.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.366
- [Monique] Awesome.
- Ooh.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.536
And all of these dresses
are mermaids.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.772
So we're off to a good start
with the shape.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.741
But we did bring a few
different options style-wise.

14:03.743 --> 14:07.045
So this one right here,
little bit more minimalistic.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.148
This one is a V-neck,
just to see a different shape

14:10.150 --> 14:11.950
and see how you feel about that.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.751
These three are strapless.

14:13.753 --> 14:17.522
Is there any one in particular

14:17.524 --> 14:20.325
that's kind of jumping out
at you saying,

14:20.327 --> 14:23.561
"Monique, try me first."

14:26.999 --> 14:28.099
Mindy don't hate me.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.968
Uh-oh.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.203
I don't like any of them.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.541
What do you think?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.911
It's got an energy to it
that I don't like as a mother.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.747
Takes me to a place
I don't like.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.515
All right, I need to breathe.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.552
Do either of these
catch your eye?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.190
There's nothing that I'm
seeing at the moment that I like.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.192
Huh.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.103
What do we think?

15:05.337 --> 15:07.171
I don't like any of them.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.043
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.478
Huh.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.014
It is very rare

15:16.016 --> 15:22.053
that I bring in five dresses from a particular
designer that a bride is interested in

15:22.055 --> 15:23.755
and she does not like
a single one.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.223
Why?

15:25.758 --> 15:29.260
So this one, I'm not
loving the V of course.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.798
This one, I don't particularly
love the heaviness of the material

15:33.800 --> 15:34.966
'cause I'm
getting married in July,

15:34.968 --> 15:37.135
- it's a little heavy.
- I hear you, it's a heavy gown.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.772
- This one, too, I'm not a fan of this V right here.
- The V? Okay.

15:40.774 --> 15:45.243
I want sexy but not hoochie.
They're two different things.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.980
I do love the bling on here,
if it was kind of like...

15:48.982 --> 15:52.784
So she can customize it
a little bit closer together.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.719
We can make it
like a soft sweetheart

15:54.721 --> 15:56.621
and give you like
an off-the-shoulder strap

15:56.623 --> 15:59.524
so it gives you a little
bit more of that modesty.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.627
- [Monique] I am open to that.
- [Mindy] Try it.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.395
I mean the worst thing
is you hate it

16:04.397 --> 16:05.997
- and you take it off, right? Right?
- Right. Mmm-hmm.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.898
Okay.

16:06.900 --> 16:09.067
It checks off
some of the boxes, not all.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.202
<i>But I'm thinking if I can
get in this dress,</i>

16:11.204 --> 16:15.340
I can at least see the vision
that I'm looking to see.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.076
What do we think?

16:18.944 --> 16:21.412
[Monique] I'm...

16:22.381 --> 16:24.549
I can see it in your face,
you're not a fan.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.485
I think it's the V
that's just throwing me off

16:27.487 --> 16:30.455
and I can't envision it
being closed.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.825
But I love the shape, I love
the bottom, I love the bling.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.093
I think just the upper half.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.028
I don't wanna show my family
this one.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.863
<i>It doesn't check off
all my boxes,</i>

16:38.865 --> 16:40.732
<i>I don't wanna
get their hopes high</i>

16:40.734 --> 16:41.699
like this is the dress
I'm gonna pick.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.701
What about either of these?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.670
'Cause these are gonna be
more close to the shape

16:45.672 --> 16:47.772
that we could
customize this dress to be.

16:47.774 --> 16:48.773
- [Monique] I can try that one.
- Yeah?

16:48.775 --> 16:49.974
- [Monique] Yeah.
- Okay. Let's do it.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.976
<i>I really don't wanna
put her in a dress</i>

16:51.978 --> 16:54.212
<i>that she's not excited
to try on.</i>

16:54.214 --> 16:56.114
But I'm still trying
to figure out how

16:56.116 --> 16:57.515
<i>I'm gonna move forward
from here.</i>

16:57.517 --> 17:03.087
- Wow. This is beautiful.
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.990
- [Mindy] Do you wanna show them this dress?
- Yeah let's show 'em this one.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.232
I'm not feeling much
of anything in this dress.

17:14.234 --> 17:18.536
<i>But my family is just waiting
for me to try something on</i>

17:18.538 --> 17:21.039
so they can see something on me.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.212
Oh, my God.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.115
- All right, ladies. Dress number one.
- [Joy] I love it.

17:31.117 --> 17:35.453
That's pretty, Mo. Oh.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.523
And we've got
a special guest here.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.758
- We've got Randy.
- Hey!

17:40.760 --> 17:42.260
Hello, beautiful ladies.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.828
- Hi, Randy.
<i>- [Randy] There's Monique.</i>

17:43.830 --> 17:44.896
How are you?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.964
Good. Nice to meet you.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.333
Nice to meet you.
You look beautiful.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.802
- Thank you.
- [Randy whoops]

17:50.804 --> 17:52.937
I love the mermaid style.

17:52.939 --> 17:58.643
I think I'm not really feeling too much
what's going on up here in this area.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.780
<i>What is it
that you don't like up here?</i>

18:02.782 --> 18:06.784
I can't really explain I can't really
explain what, I just don't love it.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.688
I don't think it's enough
blingy up here for here.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.157
- [Monique] Yeah.
- [Tiffany] I think that's what's missing for her.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.027
So the dress
that we did not come out in

18:16.029 --> 18:18.162
was a little bit blingier.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.164
- You tried that one on?
- [Monique] I did.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.699
But we didn't see it.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.935
[Mindy] I have
to catch you guys up to speed

18:23.937 --> 18:27.071
on what the last few minutes
has been like.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.173
- [both laughing] We can imagine.
- [Mindy] Oh, yes.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.478
She's saying, "No, no,
I don't like this, no."

18:33.480 --> 18:35.880
<i>[Joy] I think everybody's
starting to see</i>

18:35.882 --> 18:40.218
what I'm saying about her being
Boujetta and how picky she is.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.553
Randy, my family
calls me Boujetta.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.523
Boujetta? What does that mean?

18:45.525 --> 18:46.924
[Monique] Very over the top.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.827
Don't ask me how to
spell it, Randy. I don't know.

18:49.829 --> 18:54.765
B-O-U-G-I-etta? I don't know.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.168
Okay, so why don't we go
pull some more dresses

18:57.170 --> 18:58.035
and let's see
what we can find for you.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.971
Okay.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.007
I need to get out of this dress
and find something that I love.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.045
I'm surprised that she thought
I looked as good as I looked.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.947
[Peter and Christie laughing]

19:09.949 --> 19:11.482
Yeah, so I think
we're off to a good start.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.986
This was so much easier
than I expected it to be.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.789
I was expecting Mom and
Christie to butt heads at every corner

19:18.791 --> 19:22.093
because when I initially was
talking about what they wanted,

19:22.095 --> 19:23.995
Mom had
the really strong opinions

19:23.997 --> 19:26.998
and it wasn't, to me, lining up
with what Christie wants in a dress.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.433
All right.
Who do we think is next?

19:30.802 --> 19:33.004
Let's do the sleeve
with the plunge.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.906
- [Peter] Beauty.
- [Christie] Yeah.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.942
I think it's completely fine for
me to have a plunging neckline

19:37.944 --> 19:40.778
because I don't have
a lot going on

19:40.780 --> 19:43.080
<i>that a plunging neckline
would reveal.</i>

19:43.082 --> 19:45.082
However, I think
the concept of a neckline

19:45.084 --> 19:46.551
that plunges down
to my belly button

19:46.553 --> 19:49.220
<i>is just simply not appropriate
for my mom.</i>

19:51.290 --> 19:55.059
- Oh, my God. [chuckles]
- Uh-oh.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.695
- How are we feeling?
- Oh, my God!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.931
I'm shocked. I love it.

19:59.933 --> 20:02.200
<i>And I do think
that it would be eye-catching.</i>

20:02.202 --> 20:03.734
And that's what I'm after.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.570
<i>I'm after a little bit of spice.</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:07.672
- [Christie] This is all see-through.
- [Peter] Yeah, it is.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.341
- [Christie] Wow.
- [Peter] Let's see if Mom notices.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.978
[Christie laughing] Let's see
if Mom notices.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.846
[both gasping]

20:15.848 --> 20:18.282
- [Lisa] Oh, my gosh.
- [Ann exclaiming]

20:19.952 --> 20:21.485
[Lisa] Wow.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.290
- [Ann] Oh, wow.
- Oh...

20:36.335 --> 20:37.969
What do you think?

20:42.541 --> 20:44.275
I don't like the energy.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.777
- [Peter chuckling] Okay.
- [Lisa] No, really. I mean that.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.346
[Christie] I know you see
these things but--

20:48.348 --> 20:51.749
It's got an energy to it
that I don't like as a mother.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.651
[Christie] Okay. Okay.

20:53.653 --> 20:57.121
I pick up energies in places,

20:57.123 --> 21:01.525
<i>in people,
and also in materials.</i>

21:01.527 --> 21:05.196
<i>And the dress
has an energy about it</i>

21:05.198 --> 21:08.532
that takes me
to a place I don't like.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.869
Okay. It's a lot to take in.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.971
You know what?
I think that's the problem.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.207
It's overwhelming.

21:16.209 --> 21:19.176
There is such a thing
as too many details.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.746
It does exist and this is it.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.048
[all chuckling]

21:24.050 --> 21:27.752
It was actually tiring
for my eyes

21:27.754 --> 21:31.088
to look at
all this dress was about.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.090
All right, all right, all right.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.358
- [Lisa chuckling] Okay.
- [Christie] Breathe.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.894
- All right, I need to breathe. Okay.
- [Christie] Yeah, yeah.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.429
How do you feel?

21:38.431 --> 21:40.564
- I actually really like it.
- [Peter laughing] Yeah.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.233
Oh...

21:42.235 --> 21:43.834
[Peter chortles]

21:43.836 --> 21:45.403
I've said too much.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.672
Mom, you've said just enough.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.074
[all chuckle]

21:50.076 --> 21:54.879
I came out with high hopes but this dress
is stirring up a lot of emotion in Mom

21:54.881 --> 21:57.948
and I didn't really even know
that was all in there.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.884
- Okay.
- See you later.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.986
- Okay.
- [Peter laughing]

22:01.988 --> 22:06.557
That was unique. That
was unique. Very interesting.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.992
Too much, yeah?

22:07.994 --> 22:13.798
I knew it wasn't gonna be a
quick pick but not this long.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.033
[Peter] Let me show you what
we were playing with in the room.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.635
No, no, nothing's gonna help.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.737
[all chuckling]

22:19.739 --> 22:22.840
I don't know, I think I lost
Mom's trust out there this time.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.508
<i>And Christie
loved it in the room.</i>

22:31.683 --> 22:34.518
[Mindy] So this is
the first one we tried.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.988
- We have this one with some feathers.
- Okay.

22:39.057 --> 22:43.427
- This one, very sparkly. Lots of ruffles.
- Okay.

22:43.429 --> 22:47.064
With this one, deep V.
Not a fan.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.065
I can tell by your face.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.600
I'm learning your facial
expressions, Monique.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.736
- I'm learning.
- It's written all over.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.070
- Let me show you the trunk show dresses.
- Okay.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.806
Come with me down this way.

22:55.808 --> 23:00.044
Monique came in really, really
wanting to be a Pantora bride.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.914
So I really wanna exhaust all
the options possible with Pantora

23:03.916 --> 23:05.916
before I show her
any other designer.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.051
Too much, yeah?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.187
[Monique] Too much ruffle.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.857
- No ruffles.
- Don't worry, we'll get there.

23:12.859 --> 23:15.359
I don't love the top.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.930
I know for certain
I'm a Pantora bride.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.767
<i>But I think I stumped Mindy.</i>

23:22.769 --> 23:25.703
I'm not seeing
any off-the-shoulder,

23:25.705 --> 23:28.272
<i>I'm not seeing anything
that's really closed-up.</i>

23:28.274 --> 23:31.942
There is not one dress
that I liked from the rack.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.912
We have gone through
the Pantora dresses.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.149
- Let's visit some new designers.
- Okay.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.884
My heart's crushed a little
bit 'cause I really wanted to

23:39.886 --> 23:41.852
find a Pantora dress.

23:41.854 --> 23:44.054
But we'll see
what else is in store.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.890
- [Mindy] Can I come in?
- [Monique] Yes.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.125
Okay. So I've got
some dresses here for you.

23:49.661 --> 23:52.997
Do either of these
catch your eye?

23:55.967 --> 23:58.702
There's nothing that I'm
seeing at the moment that I like.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.772
- That first dress that we tried on.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.041
<i>Aside from the plunge, imagine
that the plunge isn't there.</i>

24:04.043 --> 24:05.376
<i>Imagine that we add</i>

24:05.378 --> 24:07.912
<i>- a beautiful off-the-shoulder strap.
- [Monique] Mmm-hmm.</i>

24:07.914 --> 24:09.980
Is there anything about that
that you don't like?

24:09.982 --> 24:11.282
No.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.985
- Monique...
- I just cannot picture it.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.988
Okay. Okay. I hear you
and I can work with that.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.657
- Okay.
- I can work with that.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.326
That is the closest
that we've gotten to it.

24:22.328 --> 24:25.830
- I'm gonna go grab the dress. Give me a second.
- Okay.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.997
Oh, gosh, I'm so sleepy.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.301
We're sitting here, we're
waiting, and we're waiting.

24:30.303 --> 24:34.538
[Tiffany] I knew it wasn't
gonna be a quick pick,

24:34.540 --> 24:35.773
I knew that.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.408
But not this long.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.446
<i>[Peter] That was not
our shining moment.</i>

24:42.448 --> 24:44.215
- We did not do well there.
- No.

24:44.217 --> 24:47.885
<i>[Peter] I don't know, I think I
lost Mom's trust out there this time.</i>

24:47.887 --> 24:51.021
And Christie
loved it in the room,

24:51.023 --> 24:53.090
so we're a little
deflated by that.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.725
I think we're going
to Pronovias.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.693
I think we've got to.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.528
I think we're going
to Pronovias. We have to.

24:57.530 --> 25:01.699
Mom needs to see dress Lake
and dress Byington.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.101
My mom and I have seen
both of these on a website

25:04.103 --> 25:07.938
and I'm just looking
for that approval, basically.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.173
- Dorothy.
- Yes.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.908
- What's up, Peter?
- So, you saw my bride, Christie.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.810
- Gorgeous.
- Yes. Beautiful. Gorgeous.

25:12.812 --> 25:16.313
- She came in specifically for two Pronovias' gowns.
- Okay, do we have them?

25:16.315 --> 25:19.083
- I hope you can tell me.
- Tell me their names.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.118
Byington and Lake.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.187
- Byington?
- Yeah.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.923
I have to look on the
computer. I haven't heard of it.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.526
Pronovias doesn't feel
like Christie's vibe.

25:28.528 --> 25:32.029
But she wants to see them,
I'm gonna find them.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.900
We're gonna put her in them. and then when
we eventually don't like them [chuckles],

25:35.902 --> 25:37.868
we're gonna find something good.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.937
- Gorg. Lake.
- That's lake.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.906
- I'll look for the other one for you.
- All right.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.975
- I don't think we have--
- Yeah, I've never seen that.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.111
- All right, hon.
- Hi.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.713
- So. Good news, bad news.
- Okay.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.982
- Good news, we have Lake.
- Okay.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.851
Bad news,
we don't have Byington.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.153
- Ooh.
- I don't believe. I have Dorothy double-checking.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.588
Well, let's play
with this gown for now.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.156
- [Christie] Yeah.
- Gorg.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.159
We feel really good about Lake
because it was feminine,

26:02.161 --> 26:04.061
<i>it was flirty, it was romantic,</i>

26:04.063 --> 26:06.030
and maybe this could be
a happy spot.

26:06.032 --> 26:10.000
Does this flutter sleeve
feel, like, matronly?

26:10.002 --> 26:12.703
- [Peter] More romantic than matronly.
- Okay.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.505
We can also
probably do it without.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.907
Yeah, maybe we can
look at it without...

26:16.909 --> 26:21.445
I feel like, without, it loses
its flounce? I don't know.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.948
I definitely have to show
Mom this dress

26:23.950 --> 26:26.150
<i>because it's something we both
thought we were into on the website.</i>

26:26.152 --> 26:28.185
We were excited about this.

26:34.759 --> 26:37.828
- Wow.
- [Christie] Do you recognize this?

26:37.830 --> 26:42.066
It doesn't look exactly like
the one you showed me.

26:42.068 --> 26:47.004
[Lisa] It's very pretty. It's a
work of art like all of them are.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.840
How do you feel?

26:49.842 --> 26:53.210
[Christie] I feel matronly
with the flutter sleeve.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.478
[Lisa] Yeah.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.547
[Peter] Let me show you what
we were playing with in the room.

26:56.549 --> 26:59.617
No, no. Nothing's gonna help.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.585
[all chuckling]

27:01.587 --> 27:06.090
The coloring is off, too.
Something about that color.

27:06.092 --> 27:10.027
And again, that color is
bringing that energy I don't like.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.764
- [Dorothy] I found the other one.
- [both gasp]

27:13.766 --> 27:15.099
[Peter chuckling]

27:15.101 --> 27:16.600
It's the complete other end
of the spectrum.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.868
Okay.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.537
- I've showed you a picture of this dress.
- [Lisa] All right.

27:20.539 --> 27:23.040
- [Dorothy] I put it in your room. Okay?
- Okay!

27:23.042 --> 27:26.076
I am so ready
to go try on this dress.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.112
<i>It's something that I see
over and over again</i>

27:28.114 --> 27:30.581
on the website
and on the Instagram.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.849
- [Peter] Let's do it.
- All right.

27:31.851 --> 27:35.152
Oh, my God. I'm like running
back there to see this dress.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.121
As fast as I can go
with all this...

27:37.123 --> 27:38.622
We're on the same playing field.

27:38.624 --> 27:39.957
[Peter] Yeah.

27:41.026 --> 27:42.893
- [Christie] Might be a different sport.
- [Peter] Yeah.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.195
[all laughing]

27:46.398 --> 27:47.364
[Mindy] What do you think?

27:49.768 --> 27:52.002
She's not giving me
much emotion.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.005
- The one we've all been waiting for.
- [Peter] There she is.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.474
I need Mom 100%.

28:01.713 --> 28:02.780
- [Mindy] Monique, can I come in?
- [Monique] Yes.

28:02.782 --> 28:06.316
All right. We're revisiting
dress number one.

28:10.055 --> 28:13.257
I'm going to show you what it
would feel like if we closed it up...

28:13.259 --> 28:15.492
- Okay.
- So you won't a seam there

28:16.528 --> 28:18.162
but it will have
the sweetheart shape

28:18.164 --> 28:20.064
and I can pin it for you,
if you'd like.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.365
Sound good?

28:25.070 --> 28:30.808
- Yeah. Can I try it on?
- Yes, you can. Absolutely we can.

28:30.810 --> 28:36.080
I don't want to think of a reality of
Monique leaving Kleinfeld without a gown.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.282
A, because her wedding's
in three months

28:38.284 --> 28:40.117
and B, she's at Kleinfeld

28:40.119 --> 28:41.985
<i>and it's all about envisioning</i>

28:41.987 --> 28:43.787
<i>that closing of
the neckline for her</i>

28:43.789 --> 28:45.856
<i>and the off the shoulder strap.</i>

28:45.858 --> 28:50.994
<i>If I can make that realization
in her head a reality,</i>

28:51.329 --> 28:53.097
hopefully we have a winner.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.165
What do you think?

29:06.044 --> 29:07.044
Can I show them?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.313
-Yes, yeah. 100%
-See what they think?

29:10.115 --> 29:12.116
She's not giving me
much emotion.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.552
She's just saying that
she wants to show her family.

29:15.554 --> 29:19.156
So I'm really nervous
if this is it or not.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.166
- [Peter] All right.
- All right, so...

29:29.168 --> 29:32.035
- We have the one we've all been waiting for.
- There she is.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.103
[Peter] Have to try it.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.940
- [Christie] Yeah.
- So, let's get right down to it.

29:36.942 --> 29:40.577
Christie saw two Pronovias'
gowns on our website.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.880
[Peter] One she's in right now

29:42.882 --> 29:47.017
and the other one is the Byington which
we actually didn't think we had in stock

29:47.019 --> 29:49.486
but Dorothy, the
magical angel she is,

29:49.954 --> 29:51.955
has miraculously found it.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.526
So, I'm curious to see
how she feels about this.

29:57.228 --> 29:59.263
How are we feeling?

29:59.265 --> 30:03.167
I think this is like
an instant no.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.769
[Christie] The idea is correct

30:05.771 --> 30:08.639
but, like, touching
this I'm, like...

30:08.641 --> 30:11.375
- She's gonna stand on her own.
- Yeah.

30:13.077 --> 30:15.946
And I just really think that
the sleeves are a no.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.949
- Yeah.
- Like we didn't like the other sleeves

30:18.951 --> 30:21.185
- and we don't really like these sleeves, I think.
- Mm-hmm.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.721
Yeah, this dress
is a total let down.

30:24.723 --> 30:27.958
Let's try her. No
sleeves, full beading,

30:27.960 --> 30:32.496
super, super romantic and
kinda classic but her train is...

30:32.498 --> 30:36.033
- Yeah, okay. Great.
- Unbelievable. Really, really unbelievable.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.969
It's a little revealing up top
but it's not overwhelming.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.972
So I really think we can
still win Mom with this dress

30:41.974 --> 30:44.341
even though it's
a little sexier up top.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.143
Yeah, we're going to the
other side of the spectrum.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.645
You have such a great shape
on your own that

30:48.647 --> 30:53.116
you just don't need to layer
all of this on top of it.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.787
[Christie] So I'm stepping into the
dress with the subtle plunging neckline

30:56.789 --> 31:00.023
which upon putting this
dress on, it's not very subtle

31:00.025 --> 31:04.094
and I am surprised
at how well that it fits.

31:04.096 --> 31:07.064
- Wow!
- How do we feel?

31:07.066 --> 31:08.265
- I love this.
- Yeah?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.834
Yeah. I think it's very me.

31:10.836 --> 31:14.538
It's something about when it's right
it just looks like it was made for you.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.173
Yeah. I think it's very me.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.609
I don't think it gets
better than this.

31:18.611 --> 31:23.914
I have everything I asked for in a
dress delivered to me on a silver platter.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.016
What do we think Mom's
gonna think about this plunge?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.784
I think it might be
a little bit much

31:27.786 --> 31:29.386
- but let's give it a try.
- Do you think it's worth a show? Yeah.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.221
- Definitely worth a show.
- Let's do it.

31:31.756 --> 31:34.124
My mom needs to love this dress.

31:34.126 --> 31:40.931
I love it and my wedding day is gonna
be the most important day of my young life

31:40.933 --> 31:42.199
and...

31:43.568 --> 31:45.469
I need Mom 100%.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.084
[both sigh] Aw!

32:01.086 --> 32:04.388
[Mindy] Long time no see.
We are in a gown.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.263
So we're back in number one
that you guys didn't see.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.733
Because this dress
used to have a plunge

32:16.735 --> 32:19.169
we kinda makeshifted it
a little bit.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.071
We do need a little skin out.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.974
- My shoulders are out.
- You don't want it? Okay.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.575
She doesn't want it.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.611
Did you add the sleeves
or the sleeves were there?

32:27.613 --> 32:32.115
[Mindy] We added the sleeves. One arm with
a thick strap, one arm with a thin strap.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.085
- Yeah I like the thicker.
<i>- [Randy] I like the thicker as well.</i>

32:35.087 --> 32:36.286
The thinner one looks like

32:36.288 --> 32:38.922
almost like a spaghetti
strap kinda fell off.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.190
[Joy] I agree with you, Randy.

32:40.192 --> 32:43.293
- And the thicker strap is, is prettier.
- Yes, glittery. Yeah.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.295
Monique tell me
what you're feeling.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.998
Um, I love...

32:48.000 --> 32:51.301
I mean the way it's modified
I actually love the dress.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.703
- Oh!
- [Monique laughs]

32:52.705 --> 32:55.005
[Mindy] Do you want to see it
with something on your head?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.740
- Sure, thank you.
- Of course.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.676
<i>[Monique] This dress checks
every box for me.</i>

32:59.678 --> 33:03.647
I love, love, love
the off the shoulder,

33:03.649 --> 33:08.085
<i>I love how nice the sweetheart
looks in the front,</i>

33:08.087 --> 33:12.055
<i>I love the shape of the dress
and I'm loving the bling.</i>

33:13.057 --> 33:14.558
- Oh!
- Oh, that is pretty.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.560
Oh, now
I'm gonna have tears out.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.829
Oh, yeah, Monique.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.698
Oh, don't do that cause,
she's even tearing up.

33:21.700 --> 33:25.068
[Mindy] Yeah, Randy, there's
some emotion happening here.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.039
Tearing up, Randy.
You can't see me.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.942
[Mindy] Everyone's tearing up.
The entire group is.

33:31.944 --> 33:32.876
[Joy] I love it.

33:32.878 --> 33:34.511
I don't wanna mess up
the beautiful dress.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.414
Monique's got tears coming
all down her face.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.718
<i>[Monique] Yeah, I think
it really just hit me, like,</i>

33:41.720 --> 33:44.688
you're in a moment in time where
you're wearing your wedding dress.

33:44.722 --> 33:48.291
And seeing everything
together, it was beautiful.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.727
Can I talk about how this was
the first dress she put on?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.863
Is this the first one she--

33:52.865 --> 33:55.599
So this was the first dress that she
had tried on that we did not come out in.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.000
<i>[Randy] Wait a minute!</i>

33:57.002 --> 33:59.736
So we just spent four hours
and it was the first dress?

33:59.738 --> 34:01.238
[all laughing]

34:01.240 --> 34:03.507
It's definitely
a Boujetta dress.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.078
Oh, oh!

34:08.080 --> 34:11.448
Um, something
just arrived for you.

34:13.017 --> 34:15.052
- [Monique] Oh, my God!
- These are from your fiance.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.521
- Aw!
- [Monique] Oh, my...

34:18.022 --> 34:19.990
[Joy] Beautiful!

34:21.626 --> 34:25.529
[Monique sobbing] Aw, babe.

34:25.531 --> 34:28.065
What a sweet guy.
Tell me about Christopher.

34:28.067 --> 34:31.802
He's just... He's so passionate
and he loves me so much

34:31.804 --> 34:33.203
but before he loves me,

34:33.205 --> 34:36.106
he loves God and that's
why I love him so much.

34:36.541 --> 34:38.041
That's beautiful.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.077
Well, Randy, I think we have
a question we have to ask her.

34:40.079 --> 34:43.046
Are you familiar
with this question?

34:43.048 --> 34:48.285
[both] Monique, are you
saying yes to the dress?

34:50.121 --> 34:51.421
- Yes.
- [all cheer]

34:53.257 --> 34:56.093
Yes. Oh!

34:58.296 --> 35:00.030
I am so ready to get married.

35:00.032 --> 35:06.103
<i>I was able to choose the first
dress which is so ironic and I love it</i>

35:06.938 --> 35:10.373
I have to say, it was taking
a long time and I was worried

35:10.375 --> 35:12.209
that we weren't gonna
find a dress for you.

35:12.211 --> 35:17.214
<i>But I want you to know, Monique,
that you look absolutely breathtaking</i>

35:17.216 --> 35:18.381
<i>and boujee</i>

35:18.383 --> 35:21.284
Ooh! Thanks, Randy!

35:21.286 --> 35:22.252
Bye, ladies.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.555
- You said yes!
- Yes!

35:28.292 --> 35:29.960
She is gonna look amazing and...

35:29.994 --> 35:32.195
[sobbing]

35:34.031 --> 35:36.166
You know, I just can't wait
for her to be my wife.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.176
[Lisa gasps]

35:46.844 --> 35:48.011
[sighs softly]

35:48.013 --> 35:50.213
- Oh!
- Oh!

35:53.084 --> 35:54.050
Oh, wow.

35:57.155 --> 36:01.258
I am shocked that I found
something that I love.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.527
[Christie] I mean it has literally
everything I said that I wanted.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.796
Like, there's embroidery, there's
beads, there's glitter there's lace.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.031
Look at the buttons,
they go all the way

36:08.033 --> 36:09.966
- down the train.
- [Peter] All the way down the train.

36:09.968 --> 36:13.103
[Ann] I think it's gorgeous.
I think she looks beautiful.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.106
[Christie] What do you think?

36:16.874 --> 36:18.141
[exhales]

36:19.977 --> 36:21.244
So, it's beautiful.

36:21.246 --> 36:23.213
- [Ann] Yes!
- I mean, it's a beautiful dress.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.049
And I do love it.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.218
Okay.

36:28.220 --> 36:32.122
- But You know I get a little uneasy...
- [both laugh]

36:32.124 --> 36:34.891
with a plunge like that.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.060
It's little bit revealing.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.999
[Ann] But she's all covered.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.303
He found the perfect compromise.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.539
It had the plunging neckline
but she's still covered.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.075
I actually love this a lot
more than I though I would.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.046
Wow. It is amazing.

36:57.982 --> 37:00.050
I think I love it too.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.954
- [Lisa] Which is amazing.
- [Christie] I mean, I really, really love it.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.522
[Peter] Even with the plunge?

37:05.524 --> 37:07.557
- [Peter laughs]
- [Lisa] Even with the plunge.

37:07.559 --> 37:11.528
It's tastefully done and I
can, I can, I can deal with it.

37:11.530 --> 37:14.231
- [Peter] Yes.
- You know, I'm surprising myself.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.533
<i>I, I don't know
what's happened to me</i>

37:16.535 --> 37:19.102
<i>but I was pleasantly surprised.</i>

37:19.104 --> 37:22.038
As Ann pointed out,
she's covered beautifully.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.907
So, we want to see a veil.
So let me go grab one.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.542
Okay, yes.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.812
This is way beyond
saying yes to a dress.

37:28.814 --> 37:34.017
This is feeling like I have
complete approval

37:34.019 --> 37:36.152
on my whole wedding.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.090
[Christie] Right? I mean,
that's what it is.

37:40.591 --> 37:41.558
Gorgeous.

37:45.029 --> 37:46.863
I don't know, I think
I'm trying not to cry.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.598
That's a good thing.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.935
I knew I was coming in
with a, with a big ask.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.537
<i>I wanted something
that looked modern,</i>

37:54.539 --> 37:57.607
<i>I wanted to look elegant
but I wanted all those details</i>

37:57.609 --> 37:59.542
<i>that are classic bridal details.</i>

37:59.544 --> 38:02.145
<i>I wanted the lace,
I wanted the beading,</i>

38:02.147 --> 38:05.582
<i>I wanted flowers and
embroidery and buttons...</i>

38:05.584 --> 38:08.018
<i>And I put on that dress
it really came to life</i>

38:08.020 --> 38:11.021
in all those details
and my mom is seeing that too.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.856
- Shall I ask you a very important question?
- Oh, my God.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.525
- Is this the first time you're asking this question?
- This is my first!

38:15.527 --> 38:18.795
- Oh, my God. Mine too.
- And I wouldn't have it any other way.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.297
Well, good.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.167
Okay, Christie, are you
saying yes to the dress?

38:27.972 --> 38:29.172
I'm saying yes to the dress!

38:29.174 --> 38:31.241
[all cheering]

38:33.210 --> 38:35.378
- [Christie] Aw!
- [Lisa] Christie!

38:37.782 --> 38:41.885
I read Peter every
descriptor in the book

38:41.887 --> 38:45.255
<i>for fantastic bridal dresses
and he brought me that.</i>

38:46.991 --> 38:49.192
<i>Literally, I don't know how
he got what I wanted</i>

38:49.194 --> 38:53.296
<i>out of my, like, list
of words, but he got it.</i>

38:53.298 --> 38:55.165
I can't believe it!
My toughest critic,

38:55.167 --> 38:57.100
I got away with a plunge.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.869
- I mean...
- [Ann] I know, I know.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.239
- I heard that you thought Peter was hot.
- Yes, yes. I said it.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.942
I said it and I have no regrets.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.911
Peter is hot. Okay, that's it.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.547
I cannot believe it!

39:10.549 --> 39:13.016
- Miracles do happen.
- [Christie] Miracles do happen.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.718
- [Ann] Right, right.
- Yes.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.186
[Ann] Okay.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.493
<i>[Monique] I'm feeling good.</i>

39:23.495 --> 39:26.963
<i>A lot of different emotions
hitting me at the same time.</i>

39:26.965 --> 39:30.767
<i>At first I did not think
this dress was what I wanted</i>

39:30.769 --> 39:34.337
<i>but Pantora was able to go ahead
and put the sleeves on for me,</i>

39:34.339 --> 39:36.005
<i>close up the middle...</i>

39:36.007 --> 39:38.775
<i>Now I love this dress.</i>

39:38.777 --> 39:40.810
[woman 1] Oh, that's beautiful.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.445
[woman 2] You look nice,
Monique.

39:42.447 --> 39:45.115
- I'm so excited to see Christopher.
- Oh!

39:45.117 --> 39:49.052
<i>I feel so blessed to be
walking down the aisle</i>

39:49.054 --> 39:52.155
<i>with this dress on
to my future husband.</i>

39:52.157 --> 39:55.058
<i>I know he's gonna
really, really love it.</i>

40:05.569 --> 40:07.937
[Christopher] I feel good
on my wedding day.

40:07.939 --> 40:13.543
Little nervous, um, anxious
and you know, excited.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.012
<i>It's like a mixture of emotions.</i>

40:16.680 --> 40:20.216
Monique is a beautiful person.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.819
She is gonna look amazing and...

40:22.821 --> 40:24.387
[sobbing]

40:27.892 --> 40:29.292
I'm just nervous.

40:35.232 --> 40:36.566
I know she's gonna be beautiful.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.469
[sniffles]

40:50.915 --> 40:54.717
<i>[Monique] All I see is
Christopher. Nobody else.</i>

40:54.719 --> 40:58.188
<i>It feels magical.
Dream come true.</i>

40:59.824 --> 41:02.125
<i>[Christopher] You know, I just
can't wait for her to be my wife.</i>

41:02.726 --> 41:05.995
[Christopher] Monique. wow.

41:08.165 --> 41:10.967
You're my best friend.
I just love you so much
