24:34.792 --> 24:36.292
[truck shakes and thumps]

24:36.375 --> 24:37.458
What the hell?

24:38.583 --> 24:39.875
-Shit.
-[flat tire thumping]

24:48.917 --> 24:50.208

[deflating tire hissing]

25:38.125 --> 25:40.542
[suspenseful music continues]

25:43.792 --> 25:45.000
[man] Car trouble?

25:46.250 --> 25:47.333
Not my night, I guess.

25:50.083 --> 25:51.333
[Paris] I can't argue with that.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.750
Sorry?

25:54.542 --> 25:56.625
You have something of mine.

25:57.708 --> 26:01.542
-[Waniya] Kip!
-[punch landing]

26:01.625 --> 26:03.000
[Waniya] Kip!

-[Waniya screams]

26:08.083 --> 26:11.083
[Waniya screams]

26:11.167 --> 26:12.917
Wait, Paris. Paris!

26:13.000 --> 26:15.250
-I was coming back. I swear.
-Shut up!

26:17.792 --> 26:18.875
[Waniya crying] I swear.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.125
Paris, no!

26:27.875 --> 26:29.292
Paris!

26:30.125 --> 26:31.125
No!

26:33.667 --> 26:35.958
[upbeat music]

26:52.125 --> 26:55.083

27:18.000 --> 27:19.042
[man] Huh.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.917
[radio continues playing]

27:46.000 --> 27:47.250
Kip Summer, that you?

27:58.167 --> 27:59.125
Ooh.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.292
Tire pop runnin' over your face?

28:02.875 --> 28:03.917
No, sheriff.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.750
[sheriff]
Well, I know who lost the fight.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.417
Where's the other guy?

28:18.708 --> 28:19.958
I don't know.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.542
Never seen him before.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.042
Smoke?

28:31.500 --> 28:32.667
Dad smokes.

28:33.583 --> 28:36.167
Yeah, well, I ain't him.

28:40.792 --> 28:43.667
-[coughs and spits]
-All got our vices.

28:51.042 --> 28:52.083
Pretty girl.

29:01.417 --> 29:02.792
[dramatic music]

29:04.375 --> 29:05.208
Well...

29:06.000 --> 29:08.792
not going anywhere
with a wheel as flat as Fargo.

[whimpering]

29:27.417 --> 29:28.917
[door opens]

29:38.958 --> 29:40.250
Poor Laura.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.542
Poor little Laura.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.583
You got a taste
of the outside world, didn't you?

29:48.208 --> 29:49.708
A world blind to this shit.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.833
That world...
it wasn't made for us.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.542
It's good to have you back.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.167
[door shutting]

30:13.417 --> 30:20.417
[sheriff singing]

30:27.917 --> 30:29.250
That'll do it.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.917
You sure it was a Volvo?

30:37.333 --> 30:38.375
Yeah.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.000
Put the word out.
Let you know what I find.

30:49.958 --> 30:51.208
Follow you to the turn-off.

30:55.542 --> 30:57.083
[woman]
What are we gonna do with her?

30:58.875 --> 31:00.917
[Paris]
Just what we were doing before.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.042
She ain't gonna work anymore,
not like that.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.250
Hey, why don't we
just sell her?

31:15.583 --> 31:17.250
You know
where we can take her.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.083
More than you'll make in a month.

31:21.417 --> 31:23.875
I need you to get the word out
for tomorrow.

31:34.875 --> 31:35.958
Jamie.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.333
What I do with her

31:50.625 --> 31:52.917
has got nothing to do with you.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.583
[tense music]

32:04.250 --> 32:06.000
[door opens]

32:32.125 --> 32:34.000
[tense music continues]

32:54.625 --> 32:56.208
You don't ever leave me again.

32:56.292 --> 32:57.333
[knocking on door]

33:02.833 --> 33:03.833
I know you.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.958
-[baby crying]
-Hey, get back in there.

33:08.042 --> 33:08.875
[man mumbles]

33:10.458 --> 33:12.333
Can I be of some assistance?

33:16.583 --> 33:17.875
I'm looking for this girl.

33:19.958 --> 33:21.208
She was here the other night.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.750
Caused quite a stir.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.167
-She inside?
-No.

33:32.542 --> 33:33.833
No, she's one of his.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.125
One of whose?

33:37.708 --> 33:39.083
Blue-eyed wolf.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.042
If I wanted to find him?

33:44.708 --> 33:46.625
He does most his hunting
up in "The Cloud".

33:48.583 --> 33:51.000
But you can't go after a wolf.

33:51.875 --> 33:53.458
Not when you're a sheep.

33:53.542 --> 33:55.208
[tense music continues]

33:58.250 --> 34:00.458
[imitates a sheep bleating]

34:00.542 --> 34:02.958
[laughs]

34:09.000 --> 34:10.083
[sheriff] So what is it?

34:13.792 --> 34:14.875
Gout.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.000
Hmm.

34:17.125 --> 34:18.333
Disease of kings.

34:20.958 --> 34:21.833
Hm?

34:22.625 --> 34:24.292
What they call it.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.000
The disease of kings.

34:29.625 --> 34:31.208
Ah, lucky me.

34:31.292 --> 34:32.792
[chuckling]

34:35.083 --> 34:36.208
How you drive?

34:36.292 --> 34:38.792
Left foot, no clutch.

34:39.875 --> 34:40.958
There you go.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.583
How are your cattle?

34:48.750 --> 34:49.792
Oh, they're dead.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.500
Most of 'em.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.083
You mind?

35:02.625 --> 35:03.458
Hmm.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.167
[pouring]

35:12.125 --> 35:13.167

35:15.208 --> 35:16.542
-Peaty.
-[door closes]

35:20.875 --> 35:21.708
Anything?

35:23.083 --> 35:26.167
The photo from a red-light camera
north of Harvey.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.333
That him?

35:34.750 --> 35:36.708
Dominic Chapel.

35:36.792 --> 35:37.917
Goes by Paris.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.125
Came here when the boom hit.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.208
Traffics girls
up and down the oil camps.

35:44.917 --> 35:47.250
-What about Waniya?
-What about her?

35:50.333 --> 35:51.833
Best you leave this to me.

35:57.375 --> 36:01.500
Used to be a saying.
"Forty below keeps out the riffraff."

36:03.042 --> 36:04.542
It just ain't true no more.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.292
Money's missing from my desk.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.792
You brought her back
to this house.

36:22.583 --> 36:23.625
It wasn't like that.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.250
Who's telling you
about these places?

36:28.167 --> 36:29.375
Is it Bear?

36:31.417 --> 36:33.625
-I asked you a question.
-It wasn't Bear.

36:35.542 --> 36:37.042
What would your mother say?

36:38.625 --> 36:39.958
You don't have a damn clue.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.542
[horse neighing]

36:46.542 --> 36:48.458
The mare is going to my brother's.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.083
She's not yours to give.

36:53.042 --> 36:54.375
I need you back here, son.

36:55.917 --> 36:58.042
Not fussing over
some damn horse we can't afford

36:58.125 --> 36:59.667
and some girl
you don't even know.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.250
That horse was Mom's.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.042
I need you back.

37:11.583 --> 37:12.625
For what?

37:15.083 --> 37:16.208
So we can scrape by?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.250
Hold on a few more years?

37:20.958 --> 37:22.000
And what?

37:26.167 --> 37:27.875
There is nothing here
for us anymore.

37:33.250 --> 37:35.042
[soft music]

[tense music]

38:09.667 --> 38:12.708
[television continues]

38:12.792 --> 38:14.125
Jamie is out tonight.

38:16.458 --> 38:18.083
You'll stay with me.

38:18.167 --> 38:20.542
[reporter] Breaking news, this just in.

38:20.625 --> 38:24.750
The sheriff of Watson county has initiated
a manhunt for Dominic Chapel.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.750
The suspect is wanted
for trafficking

38:26.833 --> 38:28.833
and assault
with a deadly weapon.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.250
Suspect is known to go
by the alias Paris...

38:35.875 --> 38:37.000
[woman] So this is him.

38:40.042 --> 38:41.792
Was hoping
you could show your girls.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.250
The ones you think knew him.

38:47.458 --> 38:48.500
I know.

38:50.417 --> 38:52.542
Wouldn't be asking
if I didn't have to.

38:53.542 --> 38:56.792
Some of them,
they are doing real well.

38:58.042 --> 38:59.417
Wish you could see them.

39:01.458 --> 39:02.750
You still matter to them.

39:05.625 --> 39:06.958
The ones I never found...

39:09.958 --> 39:12.000
Or don't you think I mattered to them?

39:15.500 --> 39:16.542
Yeah.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.042
Come on, girl.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.792
Hey.

39:43.458 --> 39:44.542
It's alright, girl.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.000
This is a nice place.

39:50.375 --> 39:51.583
They're gonna treat you real good.

39:53.208 --> 39:54.292
[man] Come on, now.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.125
[door opens]

40:03.792 --> 40:04.875
[Kip] My uncle home?

40:06.042 --> 40:07.333
He's up at the house.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.083
[piano music by Chopin playing]

40:40.167 --> 40:44.167
Colt Single Action Army .45 cal.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.417
The gun that won the West.

40:49.042 --> 40:50.792
Used by Custer...

40:51.375 --> 40:53.083
until his demise...

40:54.708 --> 40:55.875
at Little Bighorn.

40:58.792 --> 41:03.333
See, he was warned
by one of his Crow scouts

41:03.417 --> 41:06.375
about a massive
Native encampment ahead.

41:07.333 --> 41:10.542
But fearing that
his enemy would scatter,

41:10.625 --> 41:14.458
Custer... Custer charged on.

41:14.542 --> 41:18.083
When he came over
the crest of that ridge,

41:18.167 --> 41:21.875
he and his regiment of six hundred
came upon eleven thousand Indians...

41:23.042 --> 41:24.708
just waitin' for him.

41:27.292 --> 41:30.417
-Must have been quite the surprise.
-[laughs]

41:30.500 --> 41:32.208
Yes, sir.

41:32.292 --> 41:35.708
Every damn one of them
wiped out by these savages.

41:38.375 --> 41:39.917
Only American survivor...

41:41.583 --> 41:44.583
a horse named Comanche.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.125
Ironic. No?

41:49.625 --> 41:50.833
I guess so.

41:55.917 --> 41:56.958
Mmm...

42:00.208 --> 42:02.208
Just got off the phone
with your father.

42:03.458 --> 42:06.125
The Injun girl sure got you into
some trouble.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.125
Something I can help with?

42:10.500 --> 42:11.625
It's just...

42:12.958 --> 42:13.833
the sheriff...

42:15.542 --> 42:19.542
He said this man takes these girls
to the camps.

42:20.417 --> 42:23.708
-And I just thought...
-She might be on one of my fields?

42:24.792 --> 42:26.375
Sure, could be.

42:28.875 --> 42:29.917
Her name's Waniya.

42:41.792 --> 42:45.042
And you feel compelled
to find her?

42:49.958 --> 42:51.125
It's noble of you.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.500
Most everything you see here...
[clears throat]

42:58.583 --> 43:00.792
...belonged to your great-grandfather.

43:01.542 --> 43:05.917
Well, he was obsessed with the West,
the men that shaped it.

43:08.833 --> 43:11.042
Discovered a few miles from here.

43:12.250 --> 43:15.125
Mine's abandoned now,
but, uh...

43:15.208 --> 43:18.958
I still find reason to go there
from time to time,

43:19.042 --> 43:23.458
reflect upon what our ancestors did
to get me where I am.

43:26.250 --> 43:31.000
You know, there's a world outside
that ranch that your father has you on.

43:33.667 --> 43:36.458
Wanted to be a cowboy since
as long as I can remember.

43:39.833 --> 43:40.875
Now...

43:43.708 --> 43:44.792
Yeah...

43:48.167 --> 43:50.583
You can't be bound
by Hadley's choices.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.458
And that way of life is dire.

43:56.167 --> 43:57.208
Why'd you help?

43:59.417 --> 44:01.542
Land's always served me well.

44:12.958 --> 44:14.667
I never had a son.

44:16.875 --> 44:18.792
You can always come
and work for me.

44:20.875 --> 44:23.833
This country's got everything
to offer someone like you.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.625
I will put the word out...

44:28.958 --> 44:30.500
on all of my rigs.

44:33.333 --> 44:35.375
I do hope
that we can track her down.

[tension music continues]

45:15.708 --> 45:16.750
Go on.

45:20.042 --> 45:21.333
It was my sister's.

45:27.583 --> 45:29.417
I'm gonna have to leave
this place.

45:31.917 --> 45:33.042
Thinking I'd...

45:35.750 --> 45:36.917
take you with me.

45:44.625 --> 45:48.417
[hip-hop music thumping]

45:53.958 --> 45:56.250
[man] Saw they had your picture
in the news.

45:57.458 --> 45:59.917
They even used
your Christian name.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.083
[man laughs]

46:02.417 --> 46:03.583
Shit.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.500
Not bad, huh?

46:07.583 --> 46:08.708
Jim Bowie?

46:08.792 --> 46:10.292
Because your knife.
You know.

46:10.375 --> 46:13.125

You know, I remember the day
Bear showed up here.

56:06.708 --> 56:09.292
He had the face of a young boy,

56:09.375 --> 56:11.917
but tall... even then.

56:13.792 --> 56:15.458
Told me he wanted to work.

56:16.625 --> 56:18.208
Said he didn't have
a place to stay,

56:18.292 --> 56:21.333

from home.

She didn't see it that way at all.

You've got her heart, Kip.

I never thought possible.

And I know I can't tell you
what to do anymore, Kip.

You always wanted to be the cowboy.

noticed a couple girls
had disappeared.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.042
He'd take one away and...

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.667

01:27:33.417 --> 01:27:35.000

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:45.167

[muffled moans]

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:29.833
[desperate muffled cries]

01:28:30.417 --> 01:28:31.542
Ah!

01:28:38.583 --> 01:28:40.958
After my nephew
gave me your picture,

01:28:44.167 --> 01:28:46.667
I just couldn't get the image
of you out of my mind.

01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:52.458
This face.

01:28:55.958 --> 01:28:59.667
So when I found out
who it was you belonged to...

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:05.958
naturally, I just couldn't
believe my own luck.

01:29:12.667 --> 01:29:15.833
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:17.333
[bulb pops, camera shoots]

01:29:20.292 --> 01:29:22.292
[Beckett] It's all just like
my grandfather left me.

01:29:24.333 --> 01:29:28.167
First I couldn't...
understand this place.

01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:31.375
Secrets.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:38.667
What I realized ran in my blood...

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.708
and my grandfather's...

01:29:45.250 --> 01:29:46.708
and Kip's...

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.083
little by little...

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.792
I've been able to add
to his collection.

01:29:58.667 --> 01:29:59.542
Here.

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:02.208
See?

01:30:04.542 --> 01:30:07.333
Washington
called you people "beasts."

01:30:08.417 --> 01:30:12.333
Lincoln, I believe,
used the term "half-breeds."

01:30:16.417 --> 01:30:17.417
Myself,

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.958
I was always partial to...

01:30:23.917 --> 01:30:27.667
the term Jackson used
in his letters to Congress.

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:29.042
[Waniya whimpers]

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:30.958
"Savages."

01:30:34.917 --> 01:30:37.458
But I reckon any one
of them saw you,

01:30:37.542 --> 01:30:39.333
they might be given pause...

01:30:40.292 --> 01:30:41.917
before saying such things.

01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:45.042
Even just a second.

01:30:45.125 --> 01:30:50.042
-Help! Help!
-Shh!

01:30:52.083 --> 01:30:56.208
[Waniya screams]

01:30:58.708 --> 01:31:00.958
[Beckett shouts]

01:31:01.042 --> 01:31:02.708
Help her!

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.750
[Beckett's voice, echoing]
Somebody help her!

01:31:06.833 --> 01:31:08.667
[tense music]

01:31:23.792 --> 01:31:26.583
[tires screeching]

01:31:26.667 --> 01:31:30.167
[chains rattling]

01:31:34.167 --> 01:31:37.375
You believe us
to be a sickness...

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:42.167
A disease, uninvited, forever

01:31:42.250 --> 01:31:46.083
harping on about our possession
of stolen lands.

01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:50.958
That our dominance
equates to greed.

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:59.333
And you have sat here alone,
unchecked for over a thousand years.

01:32:03.875 --> 01:32:05.917
Tell me...

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.208
what do you have to show for it?

01:32:09.292 --> 01:32:10.625
[horse neighing]

01:32:12.125 --> 01:32:13.375
And here you are.

01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:17.375
Still... cowerin' among us.

01:32:20.125 --> 01:32:22.833
And you say we're the disease.

01:32:25.417 --> 01:32:29.167
This land no longer caters
to your survival.

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:34.917
[desperate muffled moaning]

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.250
[Beckett grunts loudly]

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.792
[tense music]

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:49.917

-You fucking whore.
-I'm not your whore!

01:34:27.292 --> 01:34:28.625
I'm not your savage.

01:34:30.292 --> 01:34:32.167
I'm not your anything.

01:34:35.333 --> 01:34:37.208

01:34:37.292 --> 01:34:39.208
[grunting, groaning]

01:34:43.708 --> 01:34:45.458

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:11.375
-[Kip] Jesus.
-[Waniya sobbing]

01:35:14.833 --> 01:35:17.000
-Waniya.
-Get away from me!

Stay away!
[sobbing]

01:35:26.875 --> 01:35:29.958
It's alright... I'm not him.

01:35:31.333 --> 01:35:33.875
I'm not here to hurt you. Okay?

01:35:37.333 --> 01:35:38.917
I'm just trying
to get you out of here.

01:35:41.292 --> 01:35:42.208
Come home.

01:35:46.875 --> 01:35:48.333

01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:11.333
Laura?

01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:35.583
This way.

01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:52.167
Don't move.

01:39:57.208 --> 01:39:58.708
You're gonna be okay.

01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:01.875
Easy.

01:40:03.875 --> 01:40:04.958
I'm right here.

-Stay with me, Kip.
-I'm sorry.

[horse neighing]

01:40:35.125 --> 01:40:37.792
[Kip] There was once a shadow,
nameless,

01:40:38.917 --> 01:40:40.333
that came down from the north

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:44.333
wreaking havoc on the tribes
it preyed upon.

01:40:46.833 --> 01:40:50.000
The devastation,
the pain that was suffered

01:40:50.583 --> 01:40:51.750
angered many.

01:40:54.083 --> 01:40:55.958
And they were hopeless
against such evil.

01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.542
Such hate.

01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:04.417
This outraged
the Thunder Beings, Wakinyan.

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:07.583
And they came down
from the clouds

01:41:07.667 --> 01:41:09.167
and fought back
against the darkness,

01:41:11.458 --> 01:41:15.125
shooting a thunderbolt
through its heart.
