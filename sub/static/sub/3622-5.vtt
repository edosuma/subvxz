And what a swell car it was.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.216
Downright nifty
for going to sock hops

What's a sock hop?

What's a soda parlor?

But that was all before Judy's

09:53.794 --> 09:56.728
I highly doubt this SUV

I'm a systemized, automotive

me "Sadie." No ghosts?

too much?

10:09.776 --> 10:10.609

Whoa!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.178
That drink holder
looks large enough

10:13.180 --> 10:14.112
to hold a king-size
Slurpster.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.580
King size? Yum.

Dr. Freeman.

Oh, yeah... you know,
except a K-turn.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.460
Any clue who did it?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.161
Clueless, but the blender
might know something.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.804

who took Dr. Freeman.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.406
Well, one of them was rogueish

10:41.408 --> 10:43.208
and the other was petulant,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.275
I-I guess I would say.

Rogueish and petulant.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.816

Look, I wasn't built with eyes.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.220

10:55.222 --> 10:56.788
Truth be told, I
was concentrating

10:56.790 --> 10:59.658
on making the toast
that was perfect: golden brown.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.992
Good man.

Their body temperature

11:03.997 --> 11:06.564

11:06.566 --> 11:08.767
Well, great... that narrows
the list of suspects down to...

K.P. and I

11:15.475 --> 11:17.509
A picture maybe,
or some fingerprints.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.377
Or even a voice. Did
you say a voice?

I recorded the whole thing,

You're coming with me.

and the mind drill,

11:36.663 --> 11:40.198
and the cranial drain.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.900
I didn't want to
do this, Doctor,

11:41.902 --> 11:45.670
but you've forced my hand.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.639
Help me, please!

11:47.641 --> 11:49.340
Come on, do me a salad.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.409
Your entreaties
are falling on deaf ears.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.577
Yep, just like I thought.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.945
This guy won't help us

11:53.947 --> 11:55.613
because he can't help us.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.682
Shego, what are you saying...
the man's a genius.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.286
The world's leading expert
on computerized automation.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.921
If he really knew his stuff,

12:02.923 --> 12:03.922
he'd fix your robots

12:03.924 --> 12:05.323
and be on his merry way.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.827
Right, Dr. Drakken?
Huh?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.962
Oh! I see.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.297
Yes, you're right.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.566
This Freeman clearly
is a poseur.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.234
What?! Yeah. We
should have grabbed

12:16.236 --> 12:17.502

12:17.504 --> 12:18.536
Yes... perhaps somebody

18:55.268 --> 18:57.235
( <i>yells</i> )

19:01.473 --> 19:03.074
Farewell, Kim Possible.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.243
We won't meet again.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.215
Anybody see a way out of here?

19:11.217 --> 19:13.251
No. And it's not
for a lack of trying.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.385
I can get us out.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.387
Sadie, you're still alive.

19:16.389 --> 19:19.690
Yeah, but my automated
guidance systems are fried.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.092
Someone's going to have
to drive me out of here.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.860
No problem.
Doc Freeman can take the wheel.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.896
Oh, sorry. I can't drive.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.397
You can't drive?

19:26.399 --> 19:27.932
Why else build
a self-driving car?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.400
Great.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.169
All right, all right,
when the chips are down

19:31.171 --> 19:32.770
Ron Stoppable takes charge.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.972
Now, which one of these pedal
thingies do I step on

19:34.974 --> 19:36.073
to make it go-go?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.675
( <i>mumbles and whines</i> )

19:38.377 --> 19:39.343
Miss Possible,

19:39.345 --> 19:41.012
you'll have to take the wheel.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.146
Me? No way.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.748
Confession time, Kim.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.416
I lied. I didn't cheat
for you during Barkin's test.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.717
You didn't?

19:46.719 --> 19:48.019
I was going to,
but then I realized

19:48.021 --> 19:49.453
you were doing just fine
by yourself,

19:49.455 --> 19:51.322
so I just sat back
and enjoyed the ride.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.457
Really? So I can drive?

19:53.459 --> 19:54.959
A-plus-plus, baby.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.928
Seat belts: check.

19:56.930 --> 19:57.895
Mirrors: check.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.096
Hot metal: check.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.131
Could you just
floor it please?!

20:00.133 --> 20:02.033
KIM:
Going.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.835
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

20:08.407 --> 20:10.274
( <i>gasps</i> ):
Ikes.

20:20.752 --> 20:21.819
Dead end!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.321
( <i>brakes screech</i> )

20:23.323 --> 20:25.189
And this passage is too narrow.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.257
You'll never pull a U-turn!

20:26.259 --> 20:28.960
Then the K-turn's
all I've got.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.499
Boo-yeah!

20:35.501 --> 20:36.934
Wall!

20:39.371 --> 20:41.038
( <i>yells</i> )

20:50.949 --> 20:53.784
( <i>screams</i> )

20:57.923 --> 20:59.290
( <i>tires screeching</i> )

21:02.294 --> 21:03.294
Whoa-ho-ho!

21:03.296 --> 21:04.829
Way to drive, K.P.!

21:04.831 --> 21:06.430
Well done, indeed.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.065
Want the cherry on top, Kim?

21:08.067 --> 21:09.834
Just press the red button.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.102
Well...

21:11.104 --> 21:13.170
my robot army was a failure,

21:13.172 --> 21:16.240
but at least Kim Possible
won't be around

21:16.242 --> 21:18.142
to ruin my future schemes.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.877
See? Always a
silver lining.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.045
Yes.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.113
( <i>chuckles</i> )

21:22.948 --> 21:24.282
Do you hear something?

21:25.517 --> 21:28.386
Kim Possible, you think
your car's all that,

21:28.388 --> 21:30.288
but it's not!

21:31.490 --> 21:34.258
Nailed the bad guys
and Mr. Barkin's test.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.426
I call that a good week.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.495
Confession time 2.0, Kim.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.897
I really did do all the driving
on Barkin's test.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.232
What?

21:41.234 --> 21:42.933
Are you saying
you lied about lying?

21:42.935 --> 21:44.268
Hey, I knew Kim
was a good driver.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.803
She just needed
a little confidence boost,

21:45.805 --> 21:47.271
so I fibbed.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.873
Well, I hate to approve
of dishonesty... you know,

21:48.875 --> 21:50.408
except for when it works
and no one notices.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.276
But I did really drive
just now, right?

21:52.278 --> 21:53.444
You swear?

21:53.446 --> 21:56.213
Cross my carburetor
and hope to stall.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.049
( <i>brakes squeak</i> )

21:58.051 --> 21:59.583
So did I pass?

21:59.585 --> 22:02.553
Why would the best student
driver I've ever seen

22:02.555 --> 22:05.956
insist on retaking her test
only to lower her grade?

22:05.958 --> 22:07.992
Just something
I had to do. So?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.194
You passed.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.162
B-minus.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.363
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

22:12.365 --> 22:15.132
I'll never understand teenagers.
