a pretty sketchy record.

10:48.134 --> 10:51.302
Mm...Huh--creepy bingo.

10:51.304 --> 10:53.104
Before Lyle worked
for his dad,

10:53.106 --> 10:54.973
he worked at a variety of
fast food establishments,

10:54.975 --> 10:56.975
and he was either warned
or written up every month.

10:56.977 --> 11:00.144
Ok, so he has an inability
to deal with authority.

11:00.146 --> 11:03.815
Raising a kid like that
would have been hard.

11:04.617 --> 11:08.036
I remember when I
gave birth to Lyle.

11:08.038 --> 11:11.206
My heart sank whey they told me
I'd had a boy.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.791
You wanted a girl.

11:14.543 --> 11:18.997
This country is not
too kind to black boys.

11:22.218 --> 11:25.103
Emmett Till,

11:25.105 --> 11:27.272
Oscar Grant,

11:27.274 --> 11:29.441
Trayvon Martin.

11:29.443 --> 11:32.176
So you were concerned
about Lyle's safety.

11:32.178 --> 11:37.515
Virginia's still the south, Agent Rossi.
I'm concerned about a lot of things.

11:38.567 --> 11:42.404
Has Lyle ever given you
reason to fear him?

11:42.406 --> 11:46.291
Are you suggesting he's a monster?
A stereotype?

11:46.293 --> 11:50.378
Well, from his work record
and our interview with your son,

11:50.380 --> 11:53.865
it appears
he has a bad temper.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.751
He could be hardheaded,

11:56.753 --> 12:00.038
get angry
over the smallest thing.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.723
Can you give me
an example?

12:01.725 --> 12:04.843
He'd snap for
no reason at all.

12:04.845 --> 12:06.978
Would he get physical?

12:06.980 --> 12:10.715
Did he ever hit you
or threaten you?

12:12.902 --> 12:15.854
One time, he--

12:15.856 --> 12:18.222
he threw a TV
at my head.

12:18.224 --> 12:19.691
It wasn't at her head,

12:19.693 --> 12:22.393
it--it was near her head.

12:22.395 --> 12:25.030
Well, how did your son's anger
get out of control?

12:25.032 --> 12:27.699
It was one incident.
It doesn't mean anything.

12:27.701 --> 12:30.292
Well, did this happen
during his adolescence?

12:30.317 --> 12:31.954
How was he in school?

12:31.955 --> 12:33.684
Well, he'd raise his hand

12:33.709 --> 12:36.008
and the teacher wouldn't
call on him, you know?

12:36.009 --> 12:38.009
He'd ask a girl out,
she'd laugh.

12:38.011 --> 12:40.462
And what would he do
when things got like that?

12:40.464 --> 12:44.683
Well, he'd sit in his
room alone and sulk.

12:44.685 --> 12:46.351
Well, maybe he was depressed.

12:46.353 --> 12:49.721
Black people don't have
time to be depressed.

12:49.723 --> 12:51.306
Did he ever try therapy?

12:51.308 --> 12:53.525
Or medication?

12:54.443 --> 12:56.544
Charles is against it.

12:56.546 --> 12:57.846
Why?

12:57.848 --> 13:01.265
You think slaves
had Prozac?

13:01.267 --> 13:05.070
No. They got out
there, they worked.

13:05.072 --> 13:07.205
So if your son
has mental issues,

13:07.207 --> 13:10.125
you think he should
just push through them.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.543
You're damn right.

13:11.545 --> 13:13.578
If Lyle isn't
hanging sheetrock,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.580
he's laying
hardwood floors.

13:15.582 --> 13:19.734
I have that boy out there
from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.

13:19.736 --> 13:21.886
He hasn't had the time
or the energy

13:21.888 --> 13:25.473
to kill anybody.
I made sure of that.

13:26.759 --> 13:30.294
He's picking his cuticles
and rubbing his hands incessantly,

13:30.296 --> 13:31.846
which means he's holding
something back.

13:31.848 --> 13:35.400
So Garcia found out
Lyle had a sealed juvie record.

13:35.402 --> 13:37.235
Turns out he kicked
his neighbor's dog to death.

13:37.237 --> 13:39.237
[Cell phone rings]

13:39.239 --> 13:40.638
What have you got?

13:40.640 --> 13:41.940
We just got
the DNA results back

13:41.942 --> 13:43.742
from one of the female
victims.

13:43.744 --> 13:46.477
Her name is Mary Ann Beck.
She went missing 10 years ago.

13:46.479 --> 13:48.980
She's also a high school
classmate of Lyle's.

13:48.982 --> 13:50.365
Did they know each other?
Can't tell.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.200
We haven't found a direct connection
to the house yet.

13:52.202 --> 13:53.492
All right, tear his room apart.

13:53.517 --> 13:55.597
If Lyle's got secrets, we need
to know what they are.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.540
What are you thinking?

13:58.542 --> 14:00.658
Well, his initial reaction,
he looked guilty.

14:00.660 --> 14:03.294
But he's so antagonistic
and he's not even trying to cover.

14:03.296 --> 14:05.597
He's intentionally trying
to push your buttons.

14:05.599 --> 14:07.515
All right. Let's go get
a couple of earwigs

14:07.517 --> 14:09.017
and send you two
back in there.

14:09.019 --> 14:12.003
We need to determine
whether he knows Mary Ann Beck.

14:15.558 --> 14:18.610
If you're gonna put me in jail,
just put me in jail.

14:18.612 --> 14:20.411
I wasn't gonna
put you in jail.

14:20.413 --> 14:21.679
You gonna put him in jail?

14:21.681 --> 14:24.282
We just needed
to ask you a few more questions.

14:24.284 --> 14:26.634
So...

14:26.636 --> 14:30.105
Do you like blondes
or brunettes, Lyle?

14:31.123 --> 14:33.074
I don't know.

14:33.076 --> 14:34.209
Why?

14:34.211 --> 14:37.378
You know, people think
blondes have more fun,

14:37.380 --> 14:41.365
but sometimes,
not so much.

14:44.970 --> 14:47.422
You know her, Lyle?

14:53.095 --> 14:55.480
Never seen the girl.

14:56.682 --> 14:58.733
She was in your senior class.

14:58.735 --> 15:00.685
That was a long time ago.

15:00.687 --> 15:01.657
Yeah, and she also lived

15:01.682 --> 15:03.784
a couple blocks from
the burger place you worked.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.224
A lot of people
live near there.

15:06.226 --> 15:08.359
Yeah, but not people
who look like her.

15:08.361 --> 15:10.912
That long blond hair,

15:10.914 --> 15:12.931
pretty smile,

15:12.933 --> 15:15.550
sparkling eyes.

15:15.552 --> 15:18.837
She's not my type.

15:20.256 --> 15:21.923
I think you dated her

15:21.925 --> 15:24.175
and her dad got mad.

15:24.177 --> 15:26.961
What are you talking about?

15:26.963 --> 15:29.013
We dug her up
from your yard.

15:32.134 --> 15:34.018
You're lying!

15:34.020 --> 15:35.970
She's not dead!

15:35.972 --> 15:38.473
No, Lyle, you're lying.
I'm gonna ask you again.

15:38.475 --> 15:41.759
Did you know Mary Ann Beck?

15:44.530 --> 15:46.430
No.

15:52.655 --> 15:55.240
Lyle would have kept
his secrets close to him,

15:55.242 --> 15:58.826
easy for him
to have access to.

15:58.828 --> 16:02.547
Probably
while he was in bed.

16:06.218 --> 16:07.502
This...

16:37.316 --> 16:40.118
We should get this
to forensics.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.960
Look at this.
Mary Ann Beck.

16:48.962 --> 16:50.328
He lied.

16:50.330 --> 16:54.515
Hmm. It was filled
in 1991.

16:54.517 --> 16:56.434
Let me see.

17:01.173 --> 17:03.808
It's testosterone.
My uncle used to take this.

17:03.810 --> 17:05.393
Lyle could have been
using it to bulk up.

17:05.395 --> 17:06.844
If he was still
taking it 10 years ago,

17:06.846 --> 17:08.346
it could have pushed him
over the edge

17:08.348 --> 17:11.182
and caused him to beat
Mary Ann to death.

17:13.368 --> 17:15.519
You're full of crap, Lyle.

17:15.521 --> 17:17.739
We found testosterone
in your bedroom

17:17.741 --> 17:19.490
and pictures
of you and Mary Ann.

17:19.492 --> 17:21.376
We know what you did.
You dated her

17:21.377 --> 17:23.661
and when she wanted to break up
with you, you couldn't take it.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.246
Oh, please, that's--that's
not what happened.

17:25.248 --> 17:27.382
And you took the pills
why? 'Cause you couldn't get it up,

17:27.384 --> 17:29.200
is that what happened?
No, you don't understand--

17:29.202 --> 17:31.535
You hit her and then
the rage took over.

17:31.537 --> 17:32.703
No, I didn't. No!
And you beat her!

17:32.705 --> 17:33.972
You beat her till
she stopped moving.

17:33.974 --> 17:35.590
You were so angry
that you mutilated her

17:35.592 --> 17:38.259
and then you buried her.
And every day you look out that window,

17:38.261 --> 17:39.560
you know what you did.

17:39.562 --> 17:40.895
Stop saying that!

17:40.897 --> 17:42.046
Just admit it, Lyle!

17:42.048 --> 17:44.048
You beat this girl
and you killed her.

17:44.050 --> 17:45.183
You did.

17:45.185 --> 17:47.185
Fine! I did it!

18:18.755 --> 18:19.754
What's up?

18:19.756 --> 18:22.057
We got another one.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.759
This one looks like a male.

18:42.828 --> 18:44.746
So let's
get this straight.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.432
The first person
you killed was Mary Ann Beck.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.134
That was
10 years ago.

18:49.136 --> 18:50.068
That's right.

18:50.070 --> 18:51.202
And you killed
the second woman

18:51.204 --> 18:52.604
10 years ago as well,

18:52.606 --> 18:54.806
but you don't remember
her name.

18:54.808 --> 18:57.008
That's what I said.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.528
We just found
another body, Lyle.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.263
I did that, too.

19:02.265 --> 19:05.684
Ask him if the third victim
was male or female?

19:05.686 --> 19:09.704
And at that time,
did you kill a man or a woman?

19:15.394 --> 19:17.812
A guy.

19:18.731 --> 19:20.899
So you beat him

19:20.901 --> 19:23.068
and mutilated
his genitals?

19:23.070 --> 19:26.321
Do you want me
to draw you a picture?

19:26.323 --> 19:27.756
You don't have to.

19:27.758 --> 19:30.542
Because we don't
believe you, Lyle.

19:30.544 --> 19:34.295
I did it.
I told you.

19:34.297 --> 19:36.881
The females were killed
10 years ago,

19:36.883 --> 19:38.917
but the man we dug up
out of your backyard

19:38.919 --> 19:41.369
was killed 35 years ago.

19:41.371 --> 19:43.037
You would have been 5.

19:43.039 --> 19:45.673
So what?

19:45.675 --> 19:48.876
You may have seen
the kill, Lyle,

19:48.878 --> 19:50.311
or even heard it,

19:50.313 --> 19:52.847
but you didn't do it.

19:52.849 --> 19:55.350
You didn't do any of this.

20:16.623 --> 20:19.491
He couldn't have
confessed to any damn murder.

20:19.493 --> 20:21.292

20:24.079 --> 20:27.632
Do you remember

20:27.634 --> 20:31.302
Yeah. The whole country
remembers that.

20:31.304 --> 20:34.522
You remember how law enforcement
got those kids to confess

20:34.524 --> 20:36.024
to something they didn't do?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.609
What about it?

20:37.611 --> 20:41.429
Well, we train law enforcement
now to identify and prevent

20:41.431 --> 20:44.199
false confessions.

We found a body
near your shed,

20:49.122 --> 20:54.576
belonging to a man
who was killed 35 years ago.

20:54.578 --> 20:58.797
Now, your son Lyle
was just a toddler then,

20:58.799 --> 21:02.717
and your wife doesn't pick up
anything heavier than a gardening hoe,

21:02.719 --> 21:07.288
and the personal nature
of these crimes tells us

21:07.290 --> 21:10.892
there was just one offender.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.960
You.

21:13.962 --> 21:17.298
And only you.

21:17.300 --> 21:22.303

to play this, Charles?

21:22.305 --> 21:25.573
You want to tell me
what happened?

21:39.988 --> 21:42.123
Nothing happened.

something happened.

Charles doesn't sleep here.

21:53.220 --> 21:56.387
I know, because
he sleeps back here.

22:01.694 --> 22:03.844
The guy's nostalgic.

22:07.566 --> 22:10.118
Clearly high school
was important to him.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.321
What's odd is that
he has trophies

22:13.323 --> 22:15.740
all the way
up to 11th grade,

22:15.742 --> 22:18.660
and then nothing
in his senior year.

22:18.662 --> 22:20.912
Hmm.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.681
Look at this.

22:39.683 --> 22:41.933
He's taking testosterone,
just like his son.

22:41.935 --> 22:44.602
It could be for age related
loss of vitality,

22:44.604 --> 22:46.654
wanting a boost
in his libido.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.856
He and Tina aren't sleeping
together, though.

22:48.858 --> 22:52.277
You know. Lyle's bottle was from 1991
and there are only a few pills taken.

22:52.279 --> 22:54.445
Lyle could have been
taking them from his father.

22:54.447 --> 22:58.366
Mr. Johnson's more likely the one
with the chronic issue.

22:58.368 --> 23:02.120
Why was your husband
taking testosterone, Mrs. Johnson?

23:02.122 --> 23:05.006
Was it for sexual reasons?
You and Charles sleep in separate rooms.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.507
You don't know
what we do.

23:06.509 --> 23:10.077
He snores. And why
are you asking me?

23:10.079 --> 23:11.713
So you are sexually active?

23:11.715 --> 23:13.247
That's none
of your business.

23:13.249 --> 23:15.266
Do you know if he was
seeing someone else?

23:15.268 --> 23:16.768
[Sighs]

23:16.770 --> 23:18.303
You ought to be ashamed.

and then buried in your backyard.

23:30.784 --> 23:35.320
We didn't do nothing.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.748
You notice the phrasing?

23:46.750 --> 23:48.750
Well, they're
from the south.

23:48.752 --> 23:50.530
No, it sounds like
she reacting to something

23:50.555 --> 23:52.555
that someone else did.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.006
This could be about
retaliation.

23:55.008 --> 23:58.860
That would explain
Charles' obsession with the past.

23:59.961 --> 24:04.065
Did you like growing up
in Virginia?

24:04.067 --> 24:06.434
I didn't know any different.

24:06.436 --> 24:08.269
What did your parents do?

24:08.271 --> 24:11.239
[Sighs]
My mother was the help

24:11.241 --> 24:13.858
and my father
was the butler.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.610
But there were
good times, right?

24:15.612 --> 24:16.911
You liked baseball.

24:16.913 --> 24:21.649
We found negro league
memorabilia in your house.

24:21.651 --> 24:24.485
You're a Josh Gibson fan.

24:24.487 --> 24:27.789
Yeah. "A home run a day,

24:27.791 --> 24:29.657
boost in my pay."

24:29.659 --> 24:31.759
Yeah, I like
Satchel Paige myself.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.463
Um, "don't look back.
Something might be gaining on you."

24:35.465 --> 24:37.465
He also said,

24:37.467 --> 24:40.334
"the only change
is that baseball

24:40.336 --> 24:43.971
"has turned Paige
from a second-class citizen

24:43.973 --> 24:47.025
to a second-class immortal."

24:48.394 --> 24:52.447
What did you think when
the leagues finally integrated?

24:52.449 --> 24:55.216
I was happy, of course.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.071
Well, then,
how did you feel

25:00.073 --> 25:04.542
when you found out
that your son was dating a white girl?

25:12.301 --> 25:14.886
I told Lyle
to get rid of these.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.889
So you did know
about them.

25:17.891 --> 25:20.875
Is that why
you killed her?

25:20.877 --> 25:25.129
You didn't want to see your son
dating a white girl?

25:26.381 --> 25:28.232
You don't know me.

25:29.268 --> 25:32.270
You killed
Lyle's girlfriend

25:32.272 --> 25:34.555
and buried her
in your backyard.

25:34.557 --> 25:37.358
I did not.

25:37.360 --> 25:41.662
I think we're gonna
be here a while, Charles.

25:41.664 --> 25:43.331
I'm getting hungry.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.333
You?

25:48.170 --> 25:50.829
How are those missing
persons reports going?

25:50.854 --> 25:51.957
Any I.D. on the other woman?

25:51.958 --> 25:53.508
No, nothing yet.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.242
All right, find out everything you can
about Mary Ann Beck.

25:55.244 --> 25:57.211
We need to see if we can connect her
to those two victims.

25:57.213 --> 25:58.713
Yes, sir.

26:06.388 --> 26:07.855
So...

26:07.857 --> 26:12.259
Why did you mutilate
Mary Ann's genitalia?

26:12.261 --> 26:14.395
I didn't mutilate anything.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.898
And you cut
the other girl, too.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.366
And the guy.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.369
Sexual punishment
across gender lines

26:21.371 --> 26:23.270
is pretty different.

26:23.272 --> 26:27.041
I think that
somewhere down the line,

26:27.043 --> 26:31.879
a man and a woman each made
you question your sexuality.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.715
You despise both sexes.

26:34.717 --> 26:36.634
If that were the case,

26:36.636 --> 26:40.955
I wouldn't be living
with my son and my wife.

26:40.957 --> 26:43.257
Well, that's just
part of your facade.

26:43.259 --> 26:45.092
Those people
in your backyard

26:45.094 --> 26:47.795
are victims
of your rage.

26:48.814 --> 26:52.984
Rage? What do you know
about a black man's rage?

26:52.986 --> 26:56.988
You know nothing.

27:01.610 --> 27:04.278
Come on, Lyle.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.098
You gotta
help me out here.

27:08.367 --> 27:11.151
Please, just leave my dad
out of this, ok?

27:11.153 --> 27:14.655
Nothing can justify
what he did to those women,

27:14.657 --> 27:15.873
those people.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.426
Why are you covering
for him, Lyle?

27:18.428 --> 27:21.161
He killed and mutilated
your girlfriend.

27:21.163 --> 27:24.549
No. I did that.

27:24.551 --> 27:27.468
You said she wasn't
your girlfriend.

27:36.695 --> 27:39.480
She was.

27:39.482 --> 27:42.033
[Crying]

27:42.035 --> 27:44.986
She was, you know.

27:47.188 --> 27:48.406
What have you got?

27:48.408 --> 27:49.857
M.E.'s office rushed
the DNA test

27:49.859 --> 27:52.126
and got an I.D. on the man
found near the shed.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.695
Good. I'll have Garcia
find out who he is.

27:56.465 --> 27:59.917
Well...

27:59.919 --> 28:03.671
We identified
the guy in your yard.

28:03.673 --> 28:07.174
Uh, James Moses.

28:07.176 --> 28:11.262
You know a James Moses,
Charles?

28:11.264 --> 28:15.650
Only Moses I know
parted the Red Sea.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.687
Well, James Moses was friends
with Mary Ann Beck's father

28:19.689 --> 28:22.523
Karl Beck.
Do you know Karl Beck?

28:22.525 --> 28:25.610
I told you I don't know
any Becks.

28:25.612 --> 28:27.912
Well, these two guys
belonged to a little group

28:27.914 --> 28:29.396
called the Cleanse.

28:29.398 --> 28:32.867
You ever hear of
the Cleanse, Charles?

28:32.869 --> 28:35.736
Sounds like one of those
new age diets.

28:35.738 --> 28:39.423
No, they were a klan chapter
in your town

28:39.425 --> 28:41.709
back in the sixties.

28:41.711 --> 28:44.745
When did you graduate high school?
'63, '64, something like that?

28:44.747 --> 28:46.914
Maybe.
What about it?

28:46.916 --> 28:49.967
Well, they were pretty
active back then.

28:49.969 --> 28:53.271
You see the picture
I'm painting?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.890
It's a little abstract.

28:55.892 --> 29:00.444
I think you killed
James Moses 35 years ago.

29:00.446 --> 29:02.921
And you wanted to kill
Karl Beck as well,

29:02.946 --> 29:04.816
but he was already dead.

29:04.817 --> 29:08.736
So when your son started
dating his daughter years later,

29:08.738 --> 29:11.372
you killed her instead.

29:11.374 --> 29:14.775
What do you think
about that, Charles?

29:14.777 --> 29:16.744
I think, uh...

29:18.330 --> 29:20.131
You're fishing.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.633
And I hate fish.

29:26.305 --> 29:27.588
How's he doing?

29:27.590 --> 29:29.623
I think he's making
progress.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.726
I'm surprised none of them
have lawyered up yet.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.294
Tina and Lyle haven't
because they know they're innocent.

29:34.296 --> 29:35.563
Charles is a sociopath.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.648
He thinks he can
talk his way out of it.

29:37.650 --> 29:41.268
Tell me about your run-ins
with the klan, Charles.

29:43.188 --> 29:44.939
I never ran.

29:44.941 --> 29:47.408
Well, did they stop you
at a traffic light

29:47.410 --> 29:49.410
or approach you
in a bar?

29:49.412 --> 29:52.330
I know what it was like
back then.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.082
Oh, you know
what it was like?

29:55.084 --> 29:58.652
The guy who saved my life
in Vietnam was black,

29:58.654 --> 30:02.106
as was my second wife.

30:02.108 --> 30:04.491
Brown sugar.

30:04.493 --> 30:06.794
I'll be damned.

30:11.767 --> 30:15.502
I bet you phone-banked
for Obama.

30:15.504 --> 30:18.272
No, I was too busy
putting guys like you away.

30:18.274 --> 30:21.342
Where you from, Dave?

30:21.344 --> 30:22.960
Long Island.

30:22.962 --> 30:26.447
Your I-talian
from Long Island

30:26.449 --> 30:31.986
can be as cold-blooded
as a...a klansman

30:31.988 --> 30:33.788
from Virginia.

30:37.793 --> 30:40.044
You ever used
the n-word, Dave?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.630
I'm sure I did.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.916
The same guys
who called me wop and dago.

30:45.918 --> 30:49.253
Everyone I knew back then
used that language. So what?

30:49.255 --> 30:53.140
Maybe one day some black people sit
in the front of the bus

30:53.142 --> 30:55.776
in Floral Park and you
start throwing some punches.

30:55.778 --> 30:58.646
We've already found
3 bodies, Charles.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.981
Maybe some colored folks
sit next to you

31:00.983 --> 31:02.850
at Stango's
back in the day,

31:02.852 --> 31:05.019
and, you know,
you get pissed off,

31:05.021 --> 31:06.720
you start throwing
punches at 'em.

31:06.722 --> 31:08.272
You're evading, Charles,

31:08.274 --> 31:10.825
and that suggests guilt.

31:10.827 --> 31:13.994
Oh. You go by that logic,

31:13.996 --> 31:17.998
you ain't too innocent
your damn self.

31:23.138 --> 31:26.006
There was this one time.

31:26.008 --> 31:29.043
Here we go.

31:29.045 --> 31:31.245
I was in the ninth grade,

31:31.247 --> 31:33.714
and there was this black kid
on the baseball team with me.

31:33.716 --> 31:35.449
I knew it.

31:35.451 --> 31:37.918
Break out the peanuts.

31:39.287 --> 31:41.972
He was the runt
and I was the second-smallest.

31:41.974 --> 31:43.441
You get the picture?

31:43.443 --> 31:45.559
I got it. Come on.

31:45.561 --> 31:50.397
Well, one day the other guys
get mad because he's playing with us...

31:50.399 --> 31:51.982
Mm-hmm.

31:51.984 --> 31:55.286
And they force me
to shove him into a locker

31:55.288 --> 31:58.372
and keep him there overnight.

31:59.324 --> 32:01.275
Did you do it?

32:01.277 --> 32:02.293
Sure I did.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.712
If not, they would have
done it to me.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.247
Call him names?

32:06.249 --> 32:08.299
We called him every name
in the book.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.918
Uh-huh.

32:10.920 --> 32:14.555
And then they made me
pee on him in the locker.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.557
You peed on him?

32:16.559 --> 32:18.459
They made me.

32:18.461 --> 32:20.895
[Laughing]

32:20.897 --> 32:23.097
I didn't think
it was funny at the time.

32:23.099 --> 32:25.266
Oh, it's funny.
It is funny, all right.

32:25.268 --> 32:26.600
[Laughing]

32:26.602 --> 32:28.936
I can't believe I did that.

32:28.938 --> 32:31.638
Oh, I believe it.
I believe it.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.473
And you know what's
funnier than that?

32:33.475 --> 32:35.860
Is you think
after telling me that,

32:35.862 --> 32:38.412
that I'm going to talk
to you.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.148
You know what you can do

32:41.150 --> 32:42.816
with your black wife

32:42.818 --> 32:46.120
and your black friend?

32:46.122 --> 32:52.159
You can kiss
my black ass.

33:40.335 --> 33:43.787
Hotch, we found a fourth body
buried under Charles' shed.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.173
The M.E. said based upon
decomposition levels,

33:46.175 --> 33:47.444
it looks like this guy
could have been killed

33:47.445 --> 33:49.778
around the same time
James Moses was.

33:49.780 --> 33:51.280
All right, keep us posted.
I will.

33:51.282 --> 33:52.948
So that makes two man
from way back

33:52.950 --> 33:55.117
and two women from
10 years ago.

33:55.119 --> 33:58.087
I've searched the members
of James Moses'

33:58.089 --> 33:59.404
and Karl Beck's
klan chapter

33:59.406 --> 34:02.424
and I found a Mike Mills who
was killed in a car accident

34:02.426 --> 34:04.343
quite some time before now.

34:04.345 --> 34:06.295
He had a daughter
Rachel Mills,

34:06.297 --> 34:08.380
and she was reported
as missing 10 years ago.

34:08.382 --> 34:10.014
Hotch:
Where did she live?

34:10.016 --> 34:14.219
In a neighboring town.
And I just pulled her dental records.

34:14.222 --> 34:17.056
Which are a match to the
other victim in the backyard.

34:17.058 --> 34:18.556
When did her father die?

34:18.559 --> 34:20.208
From the car accident?
20 years ago.

34:20.210 --> 34:22.527
Morgan: So first Charles
kills the two men,

34:22.530 --> 34:25.481
then years later his son coincidentally
starts dating Mary Ann Beck

34:25.483 --> 34:27.032
and it triggers him
to kill again.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.735
When he found out her father was dead,
he killed Mary Ann instead,

34:29.737 --> 34:32.071
then he did the same thing
to Mike Mills' daughter.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.456
That confirms your theory
about a vendetta.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.375
Let's find out
if these men knew Charles.

34:36.377 --> 34:38.159
None of them
are in his yearbook.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.661
Garcia, check other
schools in the area.

34:39.664 --> 34:42.748
Vegetarian hot dog
with sauerkraut and pickles.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.634
Karl Beck, Mike Mills,
and James Moses

34:44.659 --> 34:45.719
all went to
A.J. Burroughs high school,

34:45.719 --> 34:48.120
which is two towns over
from where Charles went to school.

34:48.121 --> 34:49.804
He graduated a year
prior to them.

34:49.806 --> 34:52.391
Garcia, check with their families
and see if there was any sort of

34:52.393 --> 34:55.177
altercation or feud between
Charles and these men.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.363
None of the men's parents
are still living,

34:57.365 --> 34:59.765
and none of them
have any brothers or sisters.

34:59.767 --> 35:02.001
What about half-siblings?
Ok. Ok.

35:02.003 --> 35:05.437
Shazam! Karl Beck
had a half-sister, Audrey Collins.

35:05.439 --> 35:06.638
Did she go to Burroughs?

35:06.640 --> 35:08.073
No, but she's
in Charles' yearbook.

35:08.075 --> 35:09.908
Cruz: So Charles and Audrey
went to school together.

35:09.910 --> 35:12.077
Morgan: Garcia, check and see
if she's still in the area.

35:12.079 --> 35:15.748
Oh. Audrey Collins died
from cancer 35 years ago,

35:15.750 --> 35:19.034
exactly 4 weeks before
the disappearance of James Moses.

35:19.036 --> 35:20.919
She died and Charles
started killing.

35:20.921 --> 35:23.622
Which confirms our theory
that Charles had two triggers--

35:23.624 --> 35:25.591
Audrey's death,
and 25 years later,

35:25.593 --> 35:27.259
seeing his son
with Mary Ann Beck.

35:27.261 --> 35:29.494
Garcia, find out everything
you can about Audrey Collins.

35:29.496 --> 35:31.180
She's the key to the case.

35:32.766 --> 35:33.766
Look--

35:33.768 --> 35:35.301
You don't have to
explain, man.

35:35.303 --> 35:36.802
No, you don't understand.

35:36.804 --> 35:38.304
A locker?

35:38.306 --> 35:41.523
Really? You took a leak
on the guy?

35:41.525 --> 35:45.277
I was working him, Derek.

35:47.864 --> 35:51.984
But I'd like you to do
something for me.

35:59.292 --> 36:01.627
Ohh...

36:01.629 --> 36:03.695
Ok.

36:03.697 --> 36:06.415
Send the black guy in.

36:06.417 --> 36:07.966
Huh. I was wondering

36:07.968 --> 36:10.169
when they were gonna
play that card.

36:10.171 --> 36:12.905
Attention all FBI employees,

36:12.907 --> 36:14.556
will the one negro
in the building

36:14.558 --> 36:16.642
please get to the sixth floor.

36:16.644 --> 36:18.477
You finished?

36:19.979 --> 36:23.515
But then again...

36:23.517 --> 36:27.186
You're not fully black.

36:27.188 --> 36:28.687
Are you?

36:28.689 --> 36:31.190
Well, that's ok.

36:31.192 --> 36:33.609
They say even
one drop counts.

36:33.611 --> 36:35.110
I want to ask you
some questions.

36:35.112 --> 36:36.945
No.

36:41.501 --> 36:44.420
You tell that I-talian
from Long Island

36:44.422 --> 36:47.373
to get his ass
back in here.

36:49.042 --> 36:51.627
This ain't a locker.

36:51.629 --> 36:55.247
You can't just stuff me
in here.

36:57.183 --> 36:59.685
Lyle may have seen
something when he was little,

36:59.687 --> 37:02.971
but neither he nor his
mother knew this Charles.

37:02.973 --> 37:05.224
I'm going back in there.

37:06.443 --> 37:09.561
Hey, so, uh, I just spoke
to Audrey's stepsister.

37:09.563 --> 37:11.947
There was an incident.

37:11.949 --> 37:13.782
Audrey wrote a letter.

37:22.108 --> 37:24.860
Ah, there you are.

37:24.862 --> 37:27.429
Thought you picked up
your marbles and went home,

37:27.431 --> 37:29.581
hiding under the bed
in shame.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.668
What would I be ashamed of?
It happened when I was a kid.

37:32.670 --> 37:34.169
I'm different now.

37:34.171 --> 37:35.637
People don't change.

37:35.639 --> 37:37.789
Oh, I've changed.

37:37.791 --> 37:40.292
Audrey Collins changed.

37:40.294 --> 37:43.628
"Dear Charles,
this is Audrey Collins.

37:43.630 --> 37:47.983
Years ago I told a lie
and destroyed you."

37:52.155 --> 37:55.691
You can't prove a thing.

37:55.693 --> 37:58.694
Audrey Collins went
to school with you, Charles.

37:58.696 --> 37:59.912
So what?

37:59.914 --> 38:03.248
She wrote you a letter
on her death bed,

38:03.250 --> 38:06.168
admitting she told a lie.

38:06.170 --> 38:09.988
What was she lying about,
Charles?

38:11.274 --> 38:12.791
I don't know.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.159
Oh, you know.

38:14.161 --> 38:18.964
It caused 6 klansmen to snatch you off
the street that night.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.352
She said you raped her,
didn't she?

38:23.354 --> 38:24.937
I would never
rape a woman.

38:24.939 --> 38:28.140
No, you would just
humiliate them and cut them up.

38:28.142 --> 38:29.691
That's not what I did.

38:29.693 --> 38:30.842
You're lying.

38:30.844 --> 38:32.394
No. No. She lied.

38:32.396 --> 38:36.482
Then what did she
lie about, Charles?

38:55.251 --> 38:58.587
She was fooling around
with a white guy

38:58.589 --> 39:01.256
on the football team,
and, um...

39:01.258 --> 39:05.043
When she came home
past her curfew...

39:07.564 --> 39:11.216
She said that I raped her.

39:11.218 --> 39:14.686
What did they do to you
that night?

39:15.522 --> 39:18.524
There he is.

39:18.526 --> 39:20.392
That's him.

39:20.394 --> 39:22.060
Get him!

39:22.062 --> 39:23.395
[Brakes squeal]

39:23.397 --> 39:24.563
[All shouting]

39:24.565 --> 39:25.614
No!

39:25.616 --> 39:26.731
[Shouting]

39:26.733 --> 39:27.732
[Charles screaming]

39:27.734 --> 39:28.750
Get him up there.

39:28.752 --> 39:30.285
[Shouting]

39:30.287 --> 39:31.370
Aah!

39:31.372 --> 39:33.589
Come on!

39:34.591 --> 39:39.244
They grabbed me...

39:39.246 --> 39:41.547
Dragged me out
into a field.

39:44.100 --> 39:47.419
Let me go! Help!

39:47.421 --> 39:50.272
Get out of there!
Get down!

39:50.274 --> 39:52.975
[Indistinct shouting]

39:52.977 --> 39:54.092
Shut up!

39:54.094 --> 39:55.777
You laid your
hands on my sister!

39:55.779 --> 39:57.112
I'll lay my hands
on you!

39:57.114 --> 39:59.031
I didn't do anything!
Come on!

39:59.033 --> 40:00.282
[Shouting]

40:00.284 --> 40:01.533
Stop!

40:01.535 --> 40:03.402
We got a tree for you, boy.

40:03.404 --> 40:04.436
Let me go!

40:04.438 --> 40:05.821
You're gonna fly tonight.

40:05.823 --> 40:07.873
No!

40:07.875 --> 40:09.941
[Gasping] No...

40:09.943 --> 40:11.109
No!

40:11.111 --> 40:13.245
No! No!

40:13.247 --> 40:14.546
No!

40:14.548 --> 40:15.881
Please!

40:15.883 --> 40:18.750
[Screaming]

40:21.804 --> 40:25.924
[Screaming]

40:30.313 --> 40:32.481
Hung me from a tree.

40:32.483 --> 40:34.232
Cut me.

40:35.818 --> 40:38.770
Where did they cut you?

40:44.827 --> 40:46.828
Where do you think?

40:49.282 --> 40:52.651
And that's why you take
testosterone.

40:52.653 --> 40:55.153
They castrated you.

40:58.791 --> 41:03.011
I wanted a big family.

41:03.013 --> 41:05.997
You killed all those
people for revenge.

41:05.999 --> 41:08.550
No, I killed out of hate.

41:08.552 --> 41:10.018
Yeah.

41:10.020 --> 41:12.220
Hate grew in me
that night.

41:12.222 --> 41:17.008
And hate vowed
to pay them all back.

41:17.010 --> 41:19.811
And Audrey's letter
triggered this.

41:19.813 --> 41:24.816
She ruined my life,
she writes me a letter?

41:24.818 --> 41:27.486
And that's why
you mutilated your victims.

41:27.488 --> 41:29.538
They were lucky.

41:29.540 --> 41:31.123
They were already dead.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.875
What about the lives
you destroyed?

41:33.877 --> 41:36.161
Your son's. Your wife's.

41:36.163 --> 41:38.296
I didn't do that. Audrey.

41:38.298 --> 41:40.499
All Audrey had to do

41:40.501 --> 41:42.968
was tell the truth
at the time.

41:42.970 --> 41:46.338
Not everyone
has the guts

41:46.340 --> 41:47.872
to tell the truth.

41:47.874 --> 41:51.843
Have you told Lyle
that he's not your biological son?

41:51.845 --> 41:55.397
No. And you better not!

41:57.183 --> 41:58.550
Please.

41:58.552 --> 42:00.018
What difference
does it make?

42:00.020 --> 42:02.154
You've already
ruined his life.

42:02.156 --> 42:04.723
He saw you murder
someone at 5.

42:04.725 --> 42:06.158
You killed
his girlfriend.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.993
You didn't have to
pass along your genes.

42:07.995 --> 42:09.728
You passed along
your rage.

42:09.730 --> 42:13.031
Is that what you
really wanted to do?

42:14.367 --> 42:16.334
No.

42:16.336 --> 42:18.403
Then make it right,
Charles.

42:18.405 --> 42:21.173
Audrey said that 6 guys
dragged you into the woods.

42:21.175 --> 42:23.175
We've only found
4 bodies.

42:23.177 --> 42:26.745
You give me
your full confession

42:26.747 --> 42:31.717
and I'll keep
your secret.

42:34.303 --> 42:36.087
Mm.
