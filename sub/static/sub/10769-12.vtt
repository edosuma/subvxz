00:07.440 --> 00:09.067
Big Nick, what's up, man?

00:09.242 --> 00:11.710
I'm working on the model
I got for Christmas.

00:11.878 --> 00:15.678
Oh, yeah,
I wish I got a model for Christmas. Mm!

00:16.049 --> 00:18.381
Five-nine, 120.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.451
Bloo-bloo-blap-blap! Boom!

00:22.022 --> 00:24.547
Wouldn't that be hard to put together?

00:26.059 --> 00:29.551
I'm just kidding, Nick. Don't worry.
Here, let me help you with this model.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.663
It's pretty complicated, Will.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.766
Please, boy, I was putting models together
before you was born.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.299
Come on, pass me that glue.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.130
It's pretty strong stuff, Will.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

02:04.190 --> 02:08.183
Never in the history of pugilistic pursuit
has one so completely dominated.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.419
Muhammad, what do you have to say?

02:10.597 --> 02:14.158
I'm the greatest and I'm pretty.
You know I made you, Howard.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.527
What is going on here?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.934
The family vowed
to get in shape for the new year.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.564
We gonna go to the gym. I'm gonna
take Nicky and put him in a boxing class.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.267
Fine. Just make sure he learns...

02:25.445 --> 02:28.778
...that boxing is about athleticism
and sportsmanship, not violence.

02:29.315 --> 02:32.182
Now I'm gonna get medieval on you.

02:33.853 --> 02:37.687
We ain't really get
to the sportsmanship part yet.

02:38.258 --> 02:41.159
Well, hey, Uncle Phil,
why don't you come to the gym with us?

02:41.327 --> 02:45.525
Oh, I'd love to, I really would, but I have so
much work to do on the trial this morning.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.097
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.928
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay, fine.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.265
I'm not going because I don't want to.
And you can't make me.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.042
So how do I look?

02:58.211 --> 02:59.872
Hilary, we're going to the gym.

03:00.046 --> 03:03.607
Oh, you're right, fluorescent lights.
I should put on more blush.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.753
<i>I'm a maniac, maniac on the floor</i>

03:09.756 --> 03:12.884
<i>I'm a maniac, maniac</i>

03:14.294 --> 03:16.694
You're an idiot.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.499
This is the latest design in workout wear.
Gore-Tex, breathable.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.831
Specially designed to stop any riding up
while on the stair climber.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.062
So, what do you think?

03:27.140 --> 03:30.803
I think you look like a family-size tube
of Aquafresh.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.772
Geoffrey, what do you think? Honestly.

03:34.948 --> 03:39.317
I think it's the most ridiculous costume
I've ever seen.

03:41.854 --> 03:44.414
I stand corrected.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.724
Hey, Ashley.
All ready for your first day at work?

03:47.894 --> 03:51.557
What was I thinking telling Daddy
I'd pay for half my car? I feel like a dork.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.667
And I have to wear this same stupid uniform
day after day after day.

03:56.002 --> 03:59.096
Gee, wouldn't that suck?

04:04.177 --> 04:07.078
Hey, hey, Nicky. Got you all signed up
for your boxing lesson.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.681
- So I'll meet you over by the ring later?
- Okay.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.784
I'm gonna float like a butterfly
and stink like a bee.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.854
That's close enough, all right.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.185
Oh, yeah.

04:20.392 --> 04:23.157
I'm already starting to feel the burn.

04:25.031 --> 04:28.990
Tight as them pants are, you probably
started a forest fire in your drawers.

04:30.169 --> 04:33.661
- Excuse me, Will, I have a workout to do.
- Hey, Carlton, I was reading this.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.832
It says here they have personal trainers.
Why don't you get one?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.672
No need, Will.
Carlton Banks is gym savvy.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.109
All right.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.078
Ugh!

04:46.552 --> 04:49.043
Help! Help!

04:49.222 --> 04:51.019
Help! Get it off of me!

04:51.190 --> 04:53.351
- Help!
- Hey, hey, hey.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.225
You okay?

04:56.396 --> 04:58.728
Me? Of course, I'm fine.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.264
I always scream like a girl
when I'm working out.

05:01.434 --> 05:06.064
Ha, ha, ha. Stan Callahan.
I'm the gym's personal trainer.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.265
Have you given any thoughts
to private sessions?

05:09.442 --> 05:12.275
Well, I don't really need
a personal trainer.

05:12.445 --> 05:15.903
As you can see,
I've already got a good base.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.573
Yeah, well, let's take a look.

05:23.356 --> 05:27.486
Well, according to this,
you're a can of Crisco.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.096
But spread over a good base, right?

05:32.832 --> 05:38.361
Hey, I think you're just right
for the gold package, huh?

05:38.538 --> 05:40.199
Gold?

05:40.373 --> 05:43.308
- I think I like the sound of that.
- Ha, ha, ha.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.170
Will, how do you turn these on?

05:48.281 --> 05:51.739
- You gotta work them yourself, Hil.
- Oh.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.412
Ew! I'm starting to sweat.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.259
Ninety-eight...

06:08.434 --> 06:10.834
...99...

06:11.604 --> 06:13.629
...100. Argh!

06:14.173 --> 06:15.333
Whoo!

06:15.942 --> 06:19.708
That was a heck of a workout.
What do you say we hit the showers?

06:21.681 --> 06:24.479
Okay, let's get you started
with a little aerobic exercise...

06:24.650 --> 06:26.174
...just to get the heart rate up.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.479
Sounds like a plan, Stan.

06:30.456 --> 06:34.358
All right. Okay, I'm gonna program it
for a brisk walk...

06:34.527 --> 06:37.587
...and check on you in 10 minutes.
- All right.

06:59.652 --> 07:01.085
Ah!

07:16.235 --> 07:18.066
Yeah, well...

07:18.337 --> 07:20.601
...I don't know about you...

07:21.808 --> 07:24.174
...but I'm thinking
after these hard workouts...

07:24.343 --> 07:27.938
...we both might need a little massage,
you know.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.981
What you say I bring the oils?

07:36.889 --> 07:39.517
Oh. Oh, no, no. Hell, no.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.494
Now, remember,
a clean uniform is a happy uniform. Ha, ha.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.161
Okay. Now, what's our motto?

07:53.339 --> 07:54.670
I represent Dippity Do Dog...

07:54.841 --> 07:57.401
...the best doggone dog-dipping restaurant
in the world.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.102
Very good.
Now, I assume you've read the manual?

08:00.279 --> 08:01.439
- Yes.
- Good.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.275
- Dip a dog.
- Excuse me?

08:03.449 --> 08:06.577
Dip. Come on. Dip, dip, dip.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.276
Dip.

08:11.924 --> 08:15.621
Nope, all wrong.
On page 27 of the manual it clearly states:

08:15.795 --> 08:20.562
"Dog must be dipped at a 60-degree angle
and rotated until completely coated."

08:20.733 --> 08:22.291
- Okay.
- Go ahead, try again.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.628
All right.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.065
Oh, no.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.364
Oh. Ew.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.370
Oh, God, I'm so sor... Oh!

08:28.541 --> 08:30.304
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.967
- This won't happen again. l...
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.909
- I'm sorry.
- We'll work up to the dogs.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.176
- Okay.
- Let's start with the lemonade, okay?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.515
Now, it's all in the rhythm.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.487
<i>Churn, baby, churn</i>

08:45.658 --> 08:46.682
Ow!

08:46.859 --> 08:49.384
Okay. Now you try.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.189
Okay.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.390
No, no, no. There's no rhythm.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.591
Sing.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.663
I don't want to sing.

08:58.104 --> 09:01.562
Ashley, singing is what a Dippity Dog do.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.804
<i>Churn, baby, churn
- That's it.</i>

09:05.978 --> 09:09.812
<i>Lemon inferno
Churn, baby, churn</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:15.175
Okay, come on. Ten more. You can do it.
That's it. Nine, eight.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.049
Looking good, looking good. Seven...

09:17.223 --> 09:19.817
Whoo! I am pooped.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.517
- Pooped?
- Yeah.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.596
I think it's time for a protein shake.
So, what'll it be?

09:25.765 --> 09:29.565
Tutti-frutti? Strawberry Sensation?
Come on, I'm buying.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.669
You know, I got a better idea.

09:31.837 --> 09:37.469
Why don't you get back to your workout,
you no-good, yellow-bellied waste of skin!

09:38.744 --> 09:40.041
Huh?

09:42.682 --> 09:44.843
The only thing you'll be drinking
is my boot...

09:45.017 --> 09:48.612
...if you don't get back on that machine,
you no-good pansy!

09:49.422 --> 09:53.324
I don't believe the gold package
said anything about rudeness.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.585
- Now!
- Ah!

09:58.264 --> 10:01.665
- Push! Two, three, four...
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

10:01.834 --> 10:06.203
...five, six, seven, eight.
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

10:07.907 --> 10:11.001
Stick and move. Stick and move.
Keep your jab up. Keep your jab up.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.805
Good. Okay, take a break, champ.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.907
Ha, ha. Big Nick, what's up, man?
How's your boxing lesson?

10:18.084 --> 10:21.781
Great. Helena said
I was the best in the class.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.978
Helena?

10:23.656 --> 10:26.921
Wait a minute,
you're the boxing instructor?

10:27.093 --> 10:28.788
You got a problem with that?

10:28.961 --> 10:33.591
Oh, no, no. You know, cute little gloves,
nice tight little outfit. Works for you, cutie.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.427
Now, there's a typical male attitude.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.494
Oh, no, no, no. No disrespect.

10:38.671 --> 10:41.868
I'm just saying, you know,
female boxers ain't exactly common.

10:42.041 --> 10:45.306
Ain't nobody ever heard
of Muhammad Ali Sheedy, you know.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.970
You know, it's Sonny Liston,
it's not Sonny and Cher Liston.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.878
You know what I'm saying.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.910
Sounds like you're saying you wanna
put on some gloves and spar with me.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.857
No. How'd it sound like that?
Heh, heh, heh.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.390
You don't want to?

11:02.828 --> 11:05.695
Oh, no... You know what?
My mom told me never hit a lady.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.233
Because you're not fast enough?

11:09.769 --> 11:11.464
Ah!

11:12.938 --> 11:16.897
That's a good one. That's a good one.
Now take it back.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.738
- I don't think so.
- Ooh.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.477
No need to go there. Heh, heh.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.242
- You're right.
- Ooh.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.916
That one actually hurt a little.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.083
- Look here, Helena, I was thinking...
- Ugh!

11:32.425 --> 11:34.791
Shoot.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.428
Now it's on.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.268
All right.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.279
- This is what you wanna do, huh?
- Mm-hm.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.039
- This what you want, huh?
- Come on.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.615
I'm about to give it to you.
Sneaking punches at me.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.843
- Hit me, hit me. Come on.
- I'm gonna hit you.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.749
Hit me, come on.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.749
I can't. I can't.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.654
Ugh!

12:12.398 --> 12:14.263
- Ah! Come on!
- Come on.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.628
- Come on.
- Come on. Chicken, chicken.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.105
- Come on.
- You're gonna die!

12:24.610 --> 12:26.908
I don't feel right. I don't...

12:29.915 --> 12:32.281
Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

12:32.451 --> 12:34.749
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.410
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.153
Your mama.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.928
Mama said knock you out.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.741
Shh.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.012
- Is that him?
- Yup.

13:09.188 --> 13:13.056
Wow, I never seen a freak
up close before.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.420
He's not a freak.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.352
He's just a wimp.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.828
All right, that's enough.

13:22.001 --> 13:25.129
Come on, you kids get out of here.
Go ahead, go on, get out. Go, go.

13:25.304 --> 13:29.070
Stop right there
or I'll get my sister to come after you!

13:34.113 --> 13:38.072
You bring your sister over here,
I'll knock her block off!

13:38.551 --> 13:41.987
Don't let them bother you,
Master William.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.781
You know,
I once had a chum back in England...

13:44.957 --> 13:47.858
...who was in this identical predicament.

13:48.227 --> 13:54.291
He too was being ridiculed by his peers
for suffering defeat at the hands of a lady.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.960
Oh, and he came through it all right?

13:57.136 --> 14:00.867
How should I know? You expect me
to keep in touch with a wuss like that?

14:03.209 --> 14:05.040
Hey, what happened to you?

14:05.211 --> 14:09.739
Nazi trainer made muscles sore. Ugh.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.849
Dude, you look bad.

14:12.017 --> 14:16.181
Could be worse.
Could be laughingstock of gym like you.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.225
- So how you feeling, Will?
- Not great.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.294
Son, there's a lesson to be learned here.

14:24.463 --> 14:29.059
Just because you got defeated by a, heh,
woman, doesn't make you any less of a man.

14:29.235 --> 14:32.693
- Yeah, I know that, Uncle Phil.
- I can understand your being embarrassed...

14:32.872 --> 14:36.239
...by being clocked by someone
half your size, but you'll get past it.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.309
- I'm feeling better already.
- The sheer humiliation alone...

14:39.478 --> 14:41.469
You know, I get it, Uncle Phil.

14:42.781 --> 14:46.080
I just had the worst day of my life.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.951
Well, at least I didn't get beat up
by a girl.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.335
How you doing? What's going on?
Mind if I pedal with you?

15:08.207 --> 15:10.038
That's my bike.

15:10.209 --> 15:13.337
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't see your name on it.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.742
I said, that's my machine.

15:16.248 --> 15:21.948
Uh... Look, why don't you go get a eucalyptus
wrap and some facials and stuff?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.413
Ow! Argh!

15:28.527 --> 15:31.257
Hey. You messed up my count.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.089
I hate it when people mess up my count.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.064
Oh, no.
- While you're in here...

15:37.236 --> 15:40.865
...why don't you just work out, okay?
Here, hold this.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.736
It's lover boy again.
What do you say we go for a little spin?

15:59.792 --> 16:03.455
I have my whole agenda planned.
First, I have an apple wrap...

16:03.629 --> 16:08.726
...then a hot-oil massage,
finishing with an aroma-therapy facial.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.631
I'll be lucky if I'm able to walk tomorrow.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.931
Well, today
I have a little agenda of my own.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.303
<i>I'm telling Stan we're through,
nada mas, kaputski.</i>

16:17.476 --> 16:19.376
Banks!
- Coming.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.747
Banks, you're late. Drop and give me 20.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.122
Okay, but that doesn't leave much
for yogurt.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.626
I have to give you credit
for showing up here again so soon.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.888
Why? I ain't got nothing to be afraid of.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.464
What you doing with that towel, girl?

16:43.335 --> 16:46.065
I mean, look,
when I get through with Wonder Woman...

16:46.238 --> 16:49.696
...she gonna wonder why she messed
with Will Smith in the first place.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.437
Oh, my God,
you're here to beat up a girl?

16:53.345 --> 16:57.941
Oh. Oh, well, no. You know,
I was just gonna rough her up a little bit.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.443
Will.

16:59.618 --> 17:03.054
Hey, you know,
that's just a figure of speech, Hil.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.888
So, what are you gonna do?

17:05.057 --> 17:08.857
I'm... I'm... I'm... I ain't gonna do nothing.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.790
You know how to mess up all the fun,
don't you?

17:20.873 --> 17:24.240
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey!

17:24.476 --> 17:26.842
What's up? How you doing?

17:27.012 --> 17:30.709
You know, I'm sorry about yesterday.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.613
I didn't mean to pick on you like that.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.780
What you mean, yesterday?

17:37.956 --> 17:41.050
Oh! Oh, yesterday.
You mean when you sucker-punched me.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.122
No, no. When I knocked you senseless.

17:47.633 --> 17:52.229
You know, Helena,
you actually said that like you believed it.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.134
Oh, I did. And I'm ready to do it again.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.571
Why do you keep doing that?

17:59.144 --> 18:01.578
Admit that you're afraid
and I'll leave you alone.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.545
Girl, let me tell you something.
Ain't nobody afraid of you.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.790
You know, you have a real
aggression disorder don't you?

18:13.959 --> 18:16.393
- Oh, yeah?
- Ah!

18:17.262 --> 18:18.422
Ah!

18:31.443 --> 18:35.174
Is there anything else?

18:35.481 --> 18:37.813
That was really...

18:38.450 --> 18:40.213
...impressive.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.182
Take me.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.788
Girl, you a little freaky deaky, ain't you?

18:47.359 --> 18:48.519
Now.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.527
Shoot, you don't have to tell me twice.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.898
Thank you,
and have yourself a Dippity Do Dog day.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.929
Oh, my God. Tour bus.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.631
Code red. Code red.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.539
Man your stations, man your stations.
Man your stations.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.237
- Dip. Dip. Here you go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.848
Come again. Come again.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.845
Churn, churn, churn.
Okay, okay, no problem.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.819
<i>- Churn, baby, churn, churn, baby, churn
Oh, ketchup. Okay.</i>

19:18.991 --> 19:21.892
<i>- Churn, baby, churn, churn, baby, churn
Here you go.</i>

19:22.060 --> 19:24.324
<i>Churn, baby, churn
Churn, baby, churn</i>

19:24.496 --> 19:26.191
Here, guys. Come again. Here you go.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.390
Watch out.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.734
Come again. Come again. Come again.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.365
<i>- Here you go.
Churn, baby, churn</i>

19:33.539 --> 19:35.973
- Thank you.
- Come again. No, no, the Dippity Do.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.434
<i>- Here you go.
Churn, baby, churn</i>

19:38.610 --> 19:41.272
Come again, come again. Here you go.
Come again.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.381
No problem. Here we go.
Thank you, come again, sir. Thank you.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.848
Come again. Come again? Come again.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.079
<i>Churn, baby, churn, churn, baby, churn
Churn, baby, churn?</i>

19:50.889 --> 19:53.380
All right, all right. Everybody, listen up.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.051
Everyone who wants a hot dog, over here.
Everyone who wants a drink, here.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.722
- And you, get ahold of yourself.
- Come again.

19:59.898 --> 20:03.561
Page 38 of the manual, "Don't freak out."

20:03.936 --> 20:04.960
- You're right.
- Yes.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.729
You're right. I'm okay.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.736
- Okay. All right.
- Okay. Okay.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.398
Okay. Here you go, sir. Come again.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.942
Okay.
- Come again.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.709
Okay, Ali in his heyday
versus Mike Tyson.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.613
Girl, you crazy. Ali all the way.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.845
- No, Tyson all the way.
- Oh!

20:23.021 --> 20:25.990
Are you crazy? What is wrong with you?

20:26.325 --> 20:29.920
That's it, I'm through with that trainer.
Carlton Banks is fine the way he is.

20:30.095 --> 20:33.428
I told Callahan, in no uncertain terms,
he can't push me around anymore.

20:33.599 --> 20:38.036
At first, he wasn't comfortable with it, but
I told him, "Tough, get comfortable with it."

20:38.203 --> 20:41.934
I stood up to him like a man.
I told him where to put his gold package.

20:42.107 --> 20:45.599
- What'd he say when you told him?
- He signed me up for the platinum package.

20:45.777 --> 20:48.177
It's twice the price
but he promised no rudeness.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.322
Now tell me this. Tell me this.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.391
Sugar Ray Leonard versus
Sugar Ray Robinson.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.051
Sugar Ray Leonard. He had the speed.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.289
All right, I'll give you that.
Now, this is a tough one right here.

21:07.466 --> 21:11.232
Now, how about Rocky versus Rambo?

21:14.706 --> 21:18.164
In the ring or in the jungle?

21:18.343 --> 21:19.674
Mm.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.383
- The jungle.
- The jungle.
