<i>Deep within the
bleak and dismal gowanus canal,</i>

00:04.910 --> 00:07.860
<i>hidden beneath its murky
waters, lies the headquarters</i>

00:07.860 --> 00:10.920
<i>of the most sinister
crime collective in New York ...</i>

00:10.920 --> 00:12.700
<i>the Doom Factory.</i>

00:12.700 --> 00:16.540
<i>Here, 10 of the most ruthlessly
self-involved villains on Earth</i>

00:16.540 --> 00:19.770
<i>loosely align forces against
the powers of good.</i>

00:19.780 --> 00:24.180
<i>The cold-hearted ice
sculptress, Frigid.</i>

00:24.180 --> 00:26.010
The toxic tongue of Serpentine.

00:26.020 --> 00:30.300
Oh, look everyone. Poor little
rich girl needs attention.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.720
<i>Miniature muse Eenie-Meanie
and Gerard the gorilla.</i>

00:34.720 --> 00:36.470
<i>The watchful Black Maria,</i>

00:38.980 --> 00:42.110
<i>Ultra-Violent and Billy Maim.</i>

<i>The feminine-yet-gigantic
She-Hemoth</i>

Wes Warhammer.</i>

00:51.910 --> 00:55.740
Hey, so, um, uh, guys, um...

00:55.750 --> 00:58.250
we should get Dr. Venture.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.540
Um...

01:10.540 --> 01:13.560
- is something supposed to happen here?
- Wait for it.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.180
Brock, how long is this
little home movie of yours?

01:19.190 --> 01:21.100
- It ain't a movie, Doc.
- You're telling me.

01:21.100 --> 01:24.270
It's a threat. It came
this morning in this.

01:24.270 --> 01:27.110
So, you thought it
was a good idea to just

01:27.110 --> 01:29.910
open up a box marked "Doom!"
in my house.

01:29.910 --> 01:33.200
It's hypnotic.
The simple beauty and repetitiveness

01:33.200 --> 01:35.280
really makes you think about
the paradoxical immutability

01:35.290 --> 01:38.950
- and plasticity of time.
- Ooh! Big college words.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.920
Do you want help
tonight or not, loverboy?

01:41.930 --> 01:43.290
- What's tonight?
- Hank's got a hot ...

01:43.290 --> 01:46.090
Nothing! Uh, Hank's got a...
Hank-ering

01:46.100 --> 01:49.000
to, uh... redecorate his room tonight.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.020
Good. You boys stay here
in the penthouse tonight.

01:51.020 --> 01:53.130
You, too, Doc.
I'm locking her down.

01:53.140 --> 01:57.030
<i>What? Why?</i>

02:02.610 --> 02:04.280
Because of that.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.980
<i>They're walking into a death trap.</i>

02:06.980 --> 02:10.280
- We have to call off the Warhammer arch.
- Why, exactly?

02:10.289 --> 02:12.370
<i>Because you think the world's
laziest super-scientist</i>

02:12.370 --> 02:15.540
<i>has suddenly become a costumed crusader?</i>

02:15.540 --> 02:18.740
Because I know he is.
Watch the surveillance video again.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.000
Venture and Samson run out,
and then 20 seconds later,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.500
the Blue Morpho and his
big sidekick show up?

02:24.500 --> 02:27.500
<i>Preposterous. There'd be
no time for them to change.</i>

02:27.500 --> 02:30.640
Wrong! I can do it in 18.6
seconds. Here, time me.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.010
<i>Uh, no, that won't be
necessary, Councilwoman.</i>

02:33.010 --> 02:34.890
- No, really, watch.
- Councilwoman.

02:34.890 --> 02:37.830
<i>What's become abundantly clear
is that your husband's unhealthy</i>

02:37.830 --> 02:40.980
<i>obsession with Dr. Venture
has started rubbing off on you.</i>

02:40.980 --> 02:42.520
What are you saying?

02:42.520 --> 02:44.900
<i>Maybe you should take
a day, Councilwoman.</i>

02:44.900 --> 02:46.240
Dude, you gotta get her out of there!

02:46.240 --> 02:48.410
I've been trapped in the
Morpho Cave for two hours

02:48.410 --> 02:51.690
- while she meets with her Jedi council.
- Will you calm down?

02:51.690 --> 02:53.950
I didn't know she'd just
commandeer the place.

02:53.950 --> 02:56.110
I was gonna make that
my new throne room.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.370
- Just get her outta there!
- I will.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.120
- Hey, sugar-pop, whatcha doing in here?
- Nothing, apparently.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.010
There's a rogue villain
killer on the loose,

03:07.010 --> 03:08.430
and instead of letting me do my job,

03:08.430 --> 03:10.510
the council ... in
their infinite wisdom ...

03:10.510 --> 03:13.210
thinks they can stop
him with... p-posters.

03:13.220 --> 03:16.720
Great! Out of your hands then.
You can take the day off.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.020
- Ooh!
- Get you all relaxed.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.850
- Mmm!
- Put you in a warm bath...

03:19.860 --> 03:21.720
<i>Magic Monarch hands.</i>

03:21.720 --> 03:23.020
Oh!

03:27.230 --> 03:30.230
- Yeah. You are just a tiger today.
- Mmm.

03:30.230 --> 03:34.790
- What brought this on?
- I just... miss you so much.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.070
<i>Ahh.</i>

03:36.070 --> 03:37.460
<i>Is there anything more romantic</i>

03:37.460 --> 03:39.570
<i>than a carriage ride
through Central Park?</i>

03:39.580 --> 03:42.520
<i>The wind in your hair.
The smell of horse poop that's</i>

03:42.520 --> 03:45.580
- in the wind that's in your hair.
- Um, okay, so I've waited,

03:45.580 --> 03:47.920
and since you're not gonna
say anything about it, clearly,

03:47.920 --> 03:52.090
- uh, what is with your outfit?
- You ... You don't like it?

03:52.090 --> 03:54.590
It's the ... isn't it the "bad" outfit?

03:54.590 --> 03:57.840
No, this is the good one!
Okay, we're here.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.340
We're where?

03:59.350 --> 04:00.980
Wing-men!
That's the signal.

04:00.980 --> 04:03.510
Mr. White, you're up first.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.680
Seriously, Hank,

04:04.680 --> 04:06.320
we're, like, five blocks
from my house right now.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.150
We should just get outta
here before my dad sends

04:08.150 --> 04:09.440
one of his goon squad to find me.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.520
All right, this is a holdup!
Gimme your purse, lady!

04:12.530 --> 04:14.190
- Crime!
- Come on, come on.

04:14.190 --> 04:15.830
Stand back, Sirena.
I've got this.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.110
Shoo! Ooh! Shamon!

04:19.120 --> 04:22.000
- Ohh!
- Ah! Please don't hurt me!

04:22.000 --> 04:23.420
Yeah, he'll think twice

04:23.420 --> 04:25.250
before he throws down
with Hank Venture again.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.950
Yeah, impressive.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.620
Can I get that knife for a second?

04:28.630 --> 04:30.790
Little souvenir of the
day I saved your life.

04:30.790 --> 04:34.380
Say, do you hear those
way out bongo sounds?

04:35.630 --> 04:38.930
Hey, hepcat, mind if I sit one in?

04:40.140 --> 04:43.190
Oh, my God, no.

04:43.190 --> 04:45.270
♪ Sirena ♪

04:45.280 --> 04:47.530
♪ Swam in my life ♪

04:47.530 --> 04:49.310
♪ Sirena ♪

04:49.310 --> 04:50.900

04:50.900 --> 04:53.560

Ah, crap.

04:53.570 --> 04:56.070
She's not buying it.
I'm losin' her, Deano.

04:56.070 --> 04:58.800
We're gonna have to scrap the lost
baby gag and step to phase two.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.590
<i>Ugh! Thank you!
I feel like an idiot.</i>

05:01.590 --> 05:03.660
I already secured the reservation.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.990
Brown Widow works at
a brasserie downtown

05:06.000 --> 05:07.460
<i>that is trés Hank.</i>

05:07.460 --> 05:10.830
We'll rendezvous there.
Now go to her, my brother.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.170
Whoa! What are you doin'?

05:13.170 --> 05:15.590
Granted, the song
wasn't my best, but ...

05:15.590 --> 05:18.220
My dad had me chipped like I'm
a friggin' poodle or some shit,

05:18.220 --> 05:19.470
because he's gotta know where I am

05:19.480 --> 05:21.510
all the friggin' time, I swear to God.

05:21.510 --> 05:24.600
So I just, uh, I dig 'em
out when I'm having fun.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.930
That is some whacked out parenting.
Wait. You're having... fun?

05:28.940 --> 05:31.740
<i>All right, it's time
to wrap it up down there, Doc.</i>

05:31.740 --> 05:32.940
<i>It's gettin' dark.</i>

05:32.940 --> 05:36.610
These doom creeps are like vampires.
They only arch at night.

05:36.610 --> 05:39.080
So I want you up here, in
the panic room in 10 minutes.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.280
Ya hear me, Doc?
Ya hear me, Doc?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.160
<i>Yes, I copy, Brock.</i>

05:42.170 --> 05:43.530
But I can't just drop everything.

05:43.530 --> 05:46.830
My... work is at a very delicate point.

05:46.840 --> 05:51.040
<i>I'm right on the verge of
an important breakthrough.</i>

05:51.200 --> 05:55.340
Ah! Come on, Doc! We ...
We're on the same dang team here!

05:55.340 --> 05:57.920
9 minutes, Doc.
Where are the boys?

05:57.920 --> 05:59.290
I am sworn to secrecy.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.630
- Where are the boys?
- They're in the park!

06:01.630 --> 06:05.210
Some kind of double date or something.
What ... What's goin' on?

06:05.210 --> 06:06.930
Lock the door behind me.
Lock it all down.

06:06.930 --> 06:10.550
- We got another level 10 comin' at us.
- Ah, jeez. Again?

06:10.550 --> 06:14.220
We just got the floor fixed.
All right.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.060
Ah, come on.
Ow!

06:17.060 --> 06:18.560
What the...

06:20.030 --> 06:22.230
Oh, hello.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.800
- What'd you do to him?
- Hey, what'd you do to her?

06:43.140 --> 06:45.000
Ho!

06:47.260 --> 06:50.590
Power suit. Pussy.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.590
Ho-oh!
Buddy, you just brought a knife

06:52.600 --> 06:55.680
to a directed energy harpoon fight.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.770
<i>Sweetie? You up here?</i>

06:57.770 --> 07:00.770
I've got something special for you.

07:00.770 --> 07:04.570
Do I hear a stranger in the barn?

07:04.570 --> 07:08.410
Why, miss Betty Joe, I'm just
a field hand looking for work.

07:08.410 --> 07:11.530
My pa won't let me talk to no strangers.

07:11.530 --> 07:15.450
But I get powerful lonely
all alone on this farm.

07:15.450 --> 07:19.950
If you wanna sleep in this... hay bale,
I'm sure my pa ...

07:22.210 --> 07:24.840
<i>Ugh. Can't believe I just did that!</i>

07:24.840 --> 07:27.710
I didn't know she was gonna
do farmer's daughter. Ah!

07:27.710 --> 07:30.540
I should've shot her after the hay ride!

07:30.550 --> 07:33.130
All right, what'd you dig
up on this Warhammer clown?

07:33.130 --> 07:36.130
All right, I found out all about him.
He and his gang are like

07:36.140 --> 07:37.690
this new breed of
post-modern "artsy" villain.

07:37.690 --> 07:38.970
I don't really get it.

07:38.970 --> 07:41.110
It's all a little too
"oh, look at me, I'm so clever"

07:41.110 --> 07:42.640
- for my tastes.
- Where's he hide out?

07:42.640 --> 07:45.310
Oh, he's got this sweet
underwater lair out in Brooklyn.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.360
You know, "Modern Enemy" magazine
did a lovely spread on it.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.200
Who cares?
The Blue Morpho is taking it down!

07:51.200 --> 07:54.490
- Taking it Downtown!
- Dude, no. I am not killing anyone.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.400
This book I'm reading,
it ... it says that

07:56.410 --> 07:59.240
- I have to keep my ...
- Oh, will you stop with the P.T.S.D. nonsense!

07:59.240 --> 08:02.130
So you killed a guy.
You're a supervillain!

08:02.130 --> 08:05.100
To the Morphoscooters!

08:09.500 --> 08:12.340
Ah.
Wait. Wait! How do I ...

08:12.340 --> 08:14.170
All right.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.310
Hey, you move pretty good for
a guy dressed as a water bug.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.650
- Special forces?
- Yeah, Delta.

08:25.650 --> 08:29.020
- Where'd you learn that jump thing?
- Achilles in "Troy."

08:29.020 --> 08:32.320
Ah, the Pitt-ster. Nice.
It's a totally underrated movie.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.710
Yeah, right?

08:34.860 --> 08:38.530
Look, bro, we can play Rock'em
Brock'em Robots all night,

08:38.530 --> 08:42.530
- but it ain't gonna bring them kids back.
- You got a point.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.620
And my boss'll kill me,
he finds out I lost his daughter.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.870
I figure anyone with
the stugots to cross him,

08:47.870 --> 08:49.870
they gotta be some pretty heavy hitters.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.460
So, uh, seein' as we both
got a horse in this race,

08:53.460 --> 08:57.100
- what do you say, uh, you and me...
- Seriously? A team-up?

08:57.100 --> 08:58.550
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.430
We don't gotta go putting
labels on this thing.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.890
<i>All right, my turn.</i>

09:01.890 --> 09:05.890
<i>Okay, were I king, I would
outlaw all yellow candy.</i>

09:05.890 --> 09:08.610
- Always the worst flavor.
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.230
Were I king, I would
outlaw men in sandals.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.980
No, wait. Sandals with socks!

09:12.980 --> 09:16.030
Wait! Rocco in sandals!
Wait, wait, wait!

09:16.040 --> 09:17.620
Rocco's mother so she could
never give birth to Rocco.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.370
You are a just and noble king.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.070
Guess what? We're here.

09:21.070 --> 09:24.070
And I secured the best
seat in the house, my liege.

09:24.220 --> 09:27.690
There he is!
It's teen sensation Hank Venture!

09:27.690 --> 09:29.350
Shazam! Look at his new gal pal!

09:29.360 --> 09:32.220
How's about a smooch shot
for the press, Mr. Venture?

09:32.220 --> 09:36.440
Ugh. Paparazzi.
This always happens to me.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.980
Is this place even open, Hank?

09:38.980 --> 09:41.900
I mean, what kind of establishment
is this? It's really dark.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.450
I don't know. It was
recommended to me by ...

09:43.450 --> 09:45.240
- Hiya!
- It's a fucking ninja!

09:45.240 --> 09:48.570
Ooh! Hiya!

09:48.570 --> 09:50.990
Hai. Welcome to Yumi.
Table for two? Kia.

09:50.990 --> 09:55.300
Oh, my God, yes!
Where has this place been all my life?!

09:57.170 --> 09:58.500
What is the...

09:58.500 --> 10:02.840
This has gotta be Hank.
Hank?

10:05.170 --> 10:08.930
<i>♪ Poor little white girl ♪</i>

10:08.930 --> 10:13.310
You're ... no, you're
doing it all wrong, darling.

10:13.320 --> 10:17.400
- Longer, slower strokes.
- Uh... excuse me?

10:17.400 --> 10:20.020
Where did you people come from?
Are you friends of Hank?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.160
Hank? What's "hank?"

10:21.160 --> 10:22.610
Are those the pink
ones or the yellow ones?

10:22.610 --> 10:25.740
<i>Wowie zowie!
Are you holding any?</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:28.280
Holding what?
Just who are you people?

10:28.280 --> 10:29.950
Doom Factory.

10:29.950 --> 10:32.620
<i>No, no, he's busy.</i>

10:41.130 --> 10:42.760
Ooh.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.210
Hi. You must be Rusty.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.600
Brock! Come in, Brock!
Code gre... Aw, damn it.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.770
Wow, it's ... it's so
great to finally meet you.

10:50.770 --> 10:54.640
- You're really such a beauty.
- Please, don't hurt me.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.220
Mm, you're the boss, applesauce.

11:02.820 --> 11:05.570
<i>So...
what am I supposed to... do?</i>

11:05.570 --> 11:09.190
Oh, just, um...
you know, be yourself.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.570
That's kinda hard to do.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.280
I mean, being myself would be
running out of here screaming

11:13.280 --> 11:16.240
and most likely calling my
bodyguard to beat you up,

11:16.250 --> 11:17.860
- so...
- Um,

11:17.870 --> 11:21.200
ask him if he can, uh...
take his shirt off.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.590
<i>Uh, that's great, Doc.
Now can you take your shirt off?</i>

11:24.590 --> 11:26.920
It's, uh, it's a onesie.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.260
<i>Yeah, that's fine, go ahead.</i>

11:28.260 --> 11:31.710
Weirdest... arching... ever.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.350
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Crack a window there, Marlboro Man.

11:38.350 --> 11:41.220
- That thing stinks.
- So's your Axe body spray.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.720
You want air, I can
pop the ejector seat.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.810
Hey, uh, so you, like, uh,
work for the O.S.I., right?

11:48.810 --> 11:51.160
- Yeah.
- So what'd they, like,

11:51.200 --> 11:53.900
freeze you in 1979 and just wake you up?

11:53.900 --> 11:56.530
<i>Or are you, like, part
of some time travel thing?</i>

11:56.540 --> 12:00.460
I mean the car, the clothes, the music,
this Tennessee top hat.

12:00.460 --> 12:04.380
Hey!
Do not touch the hair.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.160
<i>Well, I used to have a blog and stuff,</i>

12:07.160 --> 12:09.630
<i>but my friends thought it was stupid.</i>

12:09.630 --> 12:12.250
But, like, pfft, whatever.
Like they're so cool.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.390
I think your friends
are the stupid ones.

12:14.390 --> 12:16.140
I bet you were an awesome bloggeress.

12:16.140 --> 12:18.590
Bloggeress, yeah. What's up
with the service in this joint?

12:18.590 --> 12:20.140
Where's our waiter already?

12:20.140 --> 12:23.090
- Hai!
- Oh, my God! Are you fucking kidding me?!

12:23.120 --> 12:25.100
- Cool!
- Welcome to Yumi. Chi-ay!

12:25.100 --> 12:26.510
Start you with a beverage?

12:26.520 --> 12:29.150
You offended my family and
my temple. Fight me, ninja!

12:29.150 --> 12:31.050
- Ninja kick!
- Ninja block!

12:31.200 --> 12:34.260
Dude, table three
wants their check. Hiya!

12:34.260 --> 12:35.590
What'll you have?

12:35.590 --> 12:38.210
May I recommend the
virgin deadly colada?

12:38.210 --> 12:41.460
It comes with a rubber throwing star.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.930
- Sold!
- And for...

12:43.930 --> 12:47.640
- ...the lady?
- Hi, Jared.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.310
Yeah. So...
Hi, Sirena.

12:50.310 --> 12:54.060
- Wait you ... you two know each other?
- We used to date.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.560
Excuse me? Um, I think
"date" is a little inaccurate.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.760
Really? So what was it then?
Just messing around?

12:58.760 --> 13:01.030
- Friends with benefits?
- Are you kidding me right now?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.480
Please just get me a fucking
ninja ale, stalker boy, okay?

13:03.490 --> 13:04.820
<i>I don't need this drama.</i>

13:04.820 --> 13:10.380
Chi!
I'll... get you those drinks, now.

13:12.670 --> 13:15.410
The stink of this place.
How much further is it?!

13:15.420 --> 13:17.330
It should be right
around this next bend.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.500
Hey, don't let any of that
spray get in your mouth.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.170
It's got go...

13:22.340 --> 13:23.760
Ugh!

13:23.760 --> 13:25.260
It went in my mouth.

13:25.260 --> 13:28.090
Dead dolphin juice in my mouth.

13:28.090 --> 13:30.930
Dude, that is, like, the least
horrible thing in this water.

13:30.930 --> 13:32.260
I don't even want to tell you!

13:32.270 --> 13:34.270
Oh, God. Oh, God!
Tell me! What is in here?!

13:34.270 --> 13:37.770
Am I about to get piranha'd to death?

13:54.200 --> 13:55.290
O-Ow!

13:55.750 --> 13:56.500
Fuck!

13:56.550 --> 13:57.760
Looks like no one's here.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.380
Exactly. While Wes Bore-hammer
and his Doom Dickery

14:00.380 --> 14:01.840
are off arching Venture,

14:01.850 --> 14:06.710
the Blue Morpho and Kano
are free to fuck up his lair!

14:06.720 --> 14:10.290
And with no lair, his Guild rank
goes down, I get to cross

14:10.290 --> 14:13.860
him off my list, and wittle
#21 don't have to kill no one.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.520
Oh, yeah, thanks for taking
my feelings into consideration.

14:16.530 --> 14:18.140
So how's the brilliant Blue Morpho plan

14:18.140 --> 14:20.560
- to do all that?
- Same way I do everything amazing ...

14:20.560 --> 14:23.560
by blowing my inheritance.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.530
<i>Maybe something like this?</i>

14:25.540 --> 14:27.240
<i>Or how about if I...</i>

14:27.240 --> 14:30.410
<i>Something like that maybe?
More come-hither kittenish?</i>

14:30.410 --> 14:33.070
<i>I defer to your genius.</i>

14:33.080 --> 14:35.740
<i>So what do you think, Wes?</i>

14:35.750 --> 14:37.300
Uh, Wes?

14:37.300 --> 14:39.410
<i>Oh, Wes isn't here. He took off.</i>

14:39.420 --> 14:41.630
What ... isn't he directing this thing?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.800
<i>♪ He had a cat on her face ♪</i>

14:43.800 --> 14:47.340
All right. All right.
Pretty good. Pretty neat.

14:48.930 --> 14:54.680
<i>♪ Coming down for freebase ♪</i>

14:54.680 --> 14:57.650
<i>♪ You are my drug hunch, my little... ♪</i>

14:57.650 --> 15:00.350
- All right. Yes. Mm-hmm!
- Oh. Hey, hello again.

15:00.350 --> 15:05.440
- Have either of you seen Wes?
- Oh, wow, man. Yeah!

15:07.030 --> 15:09.940
Ah, Wes.
There's the genius.

15:09.950 --> 15:14.530
So, uh, what, are
we takin' five here, or, uh...

15:14.530 --> 15:17.500
<i>- Wes! Hi!
- Oh. Hi...</i>

15:17.500 --> 15:18.920
Wait. Wait.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.620
He's already moved on, darling.
You're old news.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.040
What are you talking about?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.790
- We were just making a movie together.
- Ohh.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.930
Did he tell you're a beauty?
That you're his new muse?

15:27.930 --> 15:29.630
<i>That's what he tells all his marks.</i>

15:29.630 --> 15:31.770
<i>- # You are my drug... #
- Is that my...</i>

15:31.770 --> 15:33.350
<i>Where are they going
with my science things?</i>

15:33.350 --> 15:35.720
<i>They're stealing them, honey!</i>

15:35.720 --> 15:41.310
- You're being arched. Remember?
- I'm ... I'm... so confused.

15:41.310 --> 15:44.450
Here. You look like
you could use a hank.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.320
Jeez, you're a mess. When
did we start doing fake blood?

15:48.320 --> 15:49.780
Eh, it's teriyaki.

15:49.790 --> 15:52.820
The birthday boy at table
five's got a nervous tummy.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.210
Ninjas.
Why'd it have to be ninjas?

15:56.210 --> 15:59.660
This far South of St. Mark's?
Eh, Wide Wale's gonna be pretty P.O.'d

15:59.660 --> 16:02.000
there's an unsanctioned
hive on his turf.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.090
- I say we roll in blasting.
- With what?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.080
What are you talking about?
With that heater on your shoulder.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.390
What is this, your first day?

16:07.390 --> 16:10.390
Not an option. I don't, uh...
it's not...

16:10.390 --> 16:15.180
- Ah. Not loaded, is it?
- That's, uh, classified.

16:15.180 --> 16:18.350
We had a guy like you in
my unit in Afghanistan.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.520
You know, there is a
book you should read.

16:20.520 --> 16:24.020
- It's called "Blood on my hands."
- Just follow my lead, Jersey Shore.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.240
Oh, come on.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.020
So you're not the first good
guy I dated. Get over it.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.690
- I mean, does it really bother you?
- Honestly? What bothers me is...

16:31.690 --> 16:33.690
I have this feeling that
maybe you're just using me

16:33.700 --> 16:35.410
to get your dad pissed.
There I said it.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.030
Whoa. Blunt.

16:37.030 --> 16:40.370
Um, I mean, is it so weird
that I might like you?

16:40.370 --> 16:44.040
Nobody ever made their friends
put on weird little skits

16:44.040 --> 16:46.920
- to impress me before.
- What? That's ... I didn't ...

16:46.930 --> 16:49.840
Four different albinos held us up,

16:49.850 --> 16:53.130
lost a fucking cat in a tree,
and took our pictures outside.

16:53.130 --> 16:55.800
A-Albinos may, in fact,
have deep pack instincts.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.940
- That's scientifically, eh, plausible.
- It's cute.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.610
I mean, I'm used to guys
just wanting to get me drunk

17:01.610 --> 17:03.610
- and then mess around.
- I don't believe in doing that.

17:03.610 --> 17:05.609
What do you believe in?

17:05.609 --> 17:08.560
Well, I believe in the soul,
the hangin' curve ball,

17:08.569 --> 17:11.650
pretzel rods, not twists,
the powdery smell of girls' deodorant,

17:11.650 --> 17:13.730
that pets talk to each other
when we're not listening.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.290
I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
acted with clones.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.910
I believe in the sweet spot,
magic invisible gnomes,

17:18.910 --> 17:21.660
that cereal is not just for
breakfast, but for any meal.

17:21.660 --> 17:25.410
And I believe in long,
slow, deep, soft, wet kisses

17:25.420 --> 17:27.250
that last three days ...

17:27.250 --> 17:29.800
stopping only to go to the
bathroom, uh, obviously.

17:31.090 --> 17:35.970
- You wanna do something crazy?
- Sister, you had me at "crazy."

17:38.060 --> 17:40.480
Ah. Are you done yet?
I wanna get home and shower.

17:40.980 --> 17:42.680
Ah! My skin is on fire!

17:42.780 --> 17:44.680
Ugh! You ... you need, like, 10 showers.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.440
And probably an aggressive
course of antibiotics.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.940
Let's get the hell outta here.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.610
- Race ya.
- Dude, don't screw around with that!

17:51.610 --> 17:53.070
Come on. It'll look all badass

17:53.080 --> 17:54.940
if we jump out right when it explodes.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.780
- Oh, with the flames all behind us!
- To who?! There's nobody here!

17:58.780 --> 18:00.280
We'll know how cool we were.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.670
Son of a ...

18:04.500 --> 18:05.950
Ah!

18:16.800 --> 18:19.350
Hey, what gives?
Where's my big boom?

18:19.350 --> 18:22.440
Huh? Must've been duds.
How old are those things?

18:22.440 --> 18:24.560
What's happening?!

18:24.560 --> 18:25.970
Dude, I don't know!

18:25.980 --> 18:29.230
- Dude!
- Dude!

18:29.230 --> 18:32.200
<i>Duuude!</i>

18:32.200 --> 18:33.810
Uhh! What the fukiya?

18:33.820 --> 18:37.650
- Pull your punches, Glenn!
- Where are the kids, ninja scum?!

18:37.650 --> 18:38.950
Whoa! Is that a real knife?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.660
Dude, you guys are way
off script ... whoa!

18:40.660 --> 18:41.990
Wrong answer!

18:41.990 --> 18:43.820
<i>Back off, tall, dark,
and loathsome!</i>

18:43.830 --> 18:47.550
This ninja-themed family
restaurant is protected by...

18:47.550 --> 18:49.160
the Brown Widow!

18:49.170 --> 18:52.330
- Wait. Family what, now?
- Whoa, whoa. It's a ninja trick.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.500
They're masters of deception.
Do not fall for it.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.220
Jared? You're the Brown Widow?

18:56.220 --> 18:59.510
Whoa. I-I thought you were
just a struggling actor like me.

18:59.510 --> 19:03.010
I'm both, Justin.
And I'm sorry,

19:03.010 --> 19:04.850
but one improv class does
not make you an actor, sir.

19:04.850 --> 19:07.820
Hank Venture and Sirena Ong ...
where are they?!

19:07.820 --> 19:10.180
You must be Brock.
Dean's told me all about you.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.650
Don't worry.
The lovebirds are right here.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.020
Eh ... son of a ditch!

19:16.530 --> 19:17.860
Ugh! Uhh!

19:17.860 --> 19:20.190
Dean? What're you doing here?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.500
- I was ...
- Never mind. Go wait in the car.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.370
Why didn't we get to be ninjas?

19:29.260 --> 19:32.870
Ahh.
Oh, I needed that.

19:32.880 --> 19:37.040
- Uh, should we be doing this?
- No. That's why it's fun!

19:37.050 --> 19:39.260
And my skin's gotta
get wet every six hours.

19:39.270 --> 19:41.270
That's part of my, you know, condition.

19:41.270 --> 19:44.020
Are your legs a big fish
tail under there now?

19:44.020 --> 19:46.190
I'm not a friggin' mermaid, Hank.

19:46.190 --> 19:49.440
So what're you waiting for,
Boy Adventurer?

19:49.440 --> 19:53.060
You gonna just stand
there or you gonna dive in?

19:53.060 --> 19:56.450
Whelp, you're
in deep now, Henry Allen.

19:56.450 --> 19:58.320
Ay-yup!

19:58.320 --> 20:01.200
Whoa! Whoa, cold! No!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.450
- Sirena!
- Oh, God! Oh, that's so cold...

20:03.460 --> 20:05.160
<i>Where are you, princess?</i>

20:05.160 --> 20:06.910
- Is he getting rough with you?!
- Hank, you're gonna get us caught! Shush!

20:09.550 --> 20:13.200
Mmm.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.340
Ah! Come on!

20:18.340 --> 20:20.420
Uhh!

20:27.230 --> 20:29.810
<i>So all this ...
the silver living room,</i>

20:29.820 --> 20:31.930
<i>the party, the screen test ...</i>

20:31.930 --> 20:35.440
it was all just to distract me
while you stole my inventions?

20:35.440 --> 20:37.020
Um... yeah.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.160
Wait, wait, wait.
And now you're just gonna go?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.830
You're leaving me with nothing?

20:40.830 --> 20:43.740
Um, no. Someone gave me
this communicator watch.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.780
Uh, I-I think it was eenie.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.620
Yeah, yeah, it was eenie. And...

20:47.620 --> 20:50.120
And she said I could
talk to God with it,

20:50.120 --> 20:53.920
but...
I-I don't have anything to say.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.840
Here, n-now you can talk to God.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.130
Wait a minute. This is my watch.
You just spray-painted it gold.

21:00.130 --> 21:03.710
That eenie's a little thief,
is what she is. You all are!

21:03.720 --> 21:06.520
Um... yeah.
