06:32.696 --> 06:34.394

shot at her.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.445

06:42.489 --> 06:44.926
Is that why
they took more land?

06:44.969 --> 06:48.103
I don't want you
to worry about this.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.409
That's my job,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.976
and I happen to be
very good at my job.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.196
Okay.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.764
But I can be
a fresh set of eyes.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.983
Or a pair
of friendly ears?

07:04.685 --> 07:07.557
Alpha said
that she would release the horde

07:07.601 --> 07:09.733
if we ever
crossed her border.

07:09.777 --> 07:15.130
Carol took a shot at her,
and she only took land.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.613
Maybe their rules
are changing.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.049
Maybe.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.618
But when you start negotiating
with a bully,

07:24.661 --> 07:28.752
there may be no end to
how much they try to take.

07:28.796 --> 07:31.451

you can live with.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.279
Others,
you gotta fight.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.630
Can we live
with the skins?

07:36.673 --> 07:39.110
Well,
theysaid we could.

07:39.154 --> 07:42.592
But you never take your enemy
at their word.

07:42.636 --> 07:46.030
You measure them
by their actions.

07:46.074 --> 07:49.207
So, when their actions
are unexpected...

07:50.731 --> 07:55.039
You know how when we want RJ
to go to sleep,

07:55.083 --> 07:57.781
the fastest way
is to let him run around?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.044
Right.

08:00.088 --> 08:02.046
'Cause then
he'll be so tired

08:02.090 --> 08:04.701
that RJ will
put himself to sleep.

08:04.745 --> 08:08.270
Maybe the Whisperers
wanna keep us fighting back

08:08.313 --> 08:11.491
until we get so tired
that they have the advantage.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.320
That is not bad,
kiddo.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.715
I knew RJ would eventually
be good for something.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.154
So, am I right?

08:23.198 --> 08:26.723
Is that
the kind of bully they are?

08:28.420 --> 08:30.074
You're thinking on it.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.868

08:56.710 --> 08:59.669

Ezekiel?

10:14.004 --> 10:16.964

10:19.531 --> 10:22.839

from the edge?

with your name on 'em.

started again today.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.717

11:59.196 --> 12:01.024

obviously you're having a day,

12:01.068 --> 12:04.332
but, you know, what happened to
rolling with it?

12:04.375 --> 12:06.987
I'm not just
gonna smile and take it.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.075
I didn't say that.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.903
But I also didn't say
run and hide.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.165
I mean, shit.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.297
You said to
kill 'em with kindness.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.082
I did say that.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.128
Look, they are trying
to get a reaction out of you.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.739
They wanna
see you upset.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.784
Don't give that to 'em.
Screw 'em.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.005
Let's go.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.789
I'm good.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.444
Now.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.103
She is just trying
to fit in.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.582
Yeah.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.932
Well, that ain't ever
gonna happen

12:38.975 --> 12:41.586
if she hangs out
with you, now, is it?

12:46.504 --> 12:47.767
We were just talking.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.943
He ain't your friend.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.335
He gets me.

12:51.379 --> 12:54.295
Just stay away
from him, alright?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.357
You know
I didn't mean to --

13:13.401 --> 13:16.012
We never would've
worked out anyway.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.885
Both too damn stubborn.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.848
Maybe in
another universe.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.850
Mm.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.818
I lost my Kingdom.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.822
I had a reign,
and what did I do with it?

13:44.127 --> 13:46.347
I failed.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.525
Benjamin, Shiva, Henry,

13:50.568 --> 13:54.137
then the Kingdom,
now Hilltop.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.923
And Carol.

14:01.188 --> 14:04.931
I don't even know
how to talk to her anymore.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.203
I didn't know
what I was gonna do

14:16.246 --> 14:18.945
when I came out here.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.953
I've been here before.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.346
Not here...

14:29.390 --> 14:33.089
but here.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.791
A long time ago,
when I was on my own,

14:39.835 --> 14:43.578
I was in
a dark place.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.886
And I started
to envy walkers.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.714
Every time
I ran into one,

14:49.758 --> 14:53.980
I'd tell myself,
"I'm gonna let it bite me."

14:54.023 --> 14:56.939
Next thing I know,

14:56.983 --> 14:58.898
my sword
was chopping off its head

14:58.941 --> 15:01.857
like it has a damn
mind of its own.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.686
So I put the sword down,

15:04.729 --> 15:07.471
kill 'em
with my own bare hands.

15:09.517 --> 15:12.259
Eventually...

15:12.302 --> 15:14.870
I just gave up.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.091
And what
that feel like?

15:19.657 --> 15:24.140
It feels like
a mask...

15:24.184 --> 15:26.490
until it doesn't.

15:26.534 --> 15:29.276
My old mask
saved my life.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.017
But I could only wear it
for so long.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.322
Mm.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.716
Just like that,

15:34.759 --> 15:37.893
you lose it all,
all over again.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.590
Hmm.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.115
And somehow...

15:42.158 --> 15:48.121
it's harder
the second time around...

15:48.164 --> 15:53.256
especially when you get used to
having someone there...

15:53.300 --> 15:58.740
that...
partner in crime...

15:58.783 --> 16:03.353
that sounding board...

16:03.397 --> 16:05.965
that walk.

16:12.014 --> 16:17.715
Now it's all on you...

16:17.759 --> 16:20.675
just you.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.205
Yet I smile.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.426
For what it's worth,

16:32.469 --> 16:34.950
you're not
a half-bad kisser.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.778
I was a mess.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.562
That was not
the top of my game,

16:38.606 --> 16:39.999
just so you know.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.783
Well, I haven't kissed anyone
over four feet

16:41.826 --> 16:45.091
in the last six years,
so...

16:46.831 --> 16:48.137
Listen.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.361
The next time
that you --

16:54.404 --> 16:56.058
Act like an idiot?

16:58.191 --> 17:02.282
Just promise me you won't
ride out by yourself again.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.720
Thank you, Michonne.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.070
Yumiko: How many left?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.550
Jerry: Three.
I'm going back in.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.769
I'll go with you.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.162
Jesus.

17:13.206 --> 17:16.035
There's more of them
out there.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.037
Well,
that's not good.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.256
Will it hold?Alden: Barely.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.344
Walkers keep
pushing in,

17:21.388 --> 17:23.085
it's gonna bring
the whole tree down.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
Might bring the whole damn
barn down with it.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.175
We got anything
to brace it with?

17:26.219 --> 17:28.090
We got some timbers
up at the house.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.179
How much time
before it comes down?

17:30.223 --> 17:31.746
How much time?

17:31.789 --> 17:33.313
Enough, I hope.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.144
Uh, guys?

17:38.970 --> 17:41.103
We'll take the walkers.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.373
Alfred:
It's not happening.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.636
Gage: No.
Not at all.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.203
Tastes good to me --

17:55.291 --> 17:57.076
Give us some room,
please?

18:08.391 --> 18:11.133
Oh, my God,
what is wrong with you?

18:11.177 --> 18:12.656
You're crazy!

18:18.009 --> 18:20.099
Is this
why Ozzie and Alek died?

18:20.142 --> 18:21.883
So she could
make a fool out of us?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.626
Not here.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.891
Shh.

18:36.332 --> 18:40.293
You do wanna
live here, right?

18:41.337 --> 18:43.731
They deserved it.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.124
I know.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.083
But you can't be doing
shit like that.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.345
But they can just

18:49.389 --> 18:51.391
write whatever the hell
they want on our door?

18:52.435 --> 18:54.437
I'll talk to 'em.
I'll set 'em straight.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.786
No, please.

18:56.570 --> 19:00.095
I don't want you
to fight my fights for me, okay?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.879
They want me to give up.
I know that.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.142
But I'm not gonna,
okay?

19:03.185 --> 19:04.926
I can't.
I get it.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.102
Can't you just
avoid 'em?

19:17.243 --> 19:18.940
Great.

19:28.515 --> 19:32.997
Shh.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.568
Ugh!

19:38.612 --> 19:39.613
Why do you hate me?

19:39.656 --> 19:41.963
You put my friends
on spikes.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.356
I wasn't there.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.531
Ugh!

19:44.574 --> 19:48.187
Ozzie was always
a fair man.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
So in his honor,

19:50.406 --> 19:53.453
I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.237
If you run away now,

19:55.281 --> 19:58.588
we'll play dumb
when they ask us.

19:58.632 --> 20:00.808
This is my home.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.158
You're my people.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.295
Get in there, kid!Ozzie was
my best friend!

20:09.338 --> 20:10.513
What about
your friend Addy?

20:10.557 --> 20:13.777
Get up! Get up!And Rodney?

20:13.821 --> 20:15.605
Aah!
Come on!

20:15.649 --> 20:18.391
Come on!

20:18.434 --> 20:21.176
I loved Henry.
You know I loved him. Please.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.786
Please.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.571
Ugh!

20:26.137 --> 20:28.488
Get off me!

20:28.531 --> 20:29.924
Ugh! Ohh!

20:35.016 --> 20:37.366
Hold her down.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.020
Get her.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.285
Ohh!

20:51.859 --> 20:53.774
Hey, hey, hey.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.646
It's okay.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.085
We were just
trying to scare her.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.304
Brandon:
Yo, Negan!

21:02.348 --> 21:04.437
What the hell's going on
back here?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.699
Holy shit.
Margo.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.570
Margo.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.060
Shit.

21:26.937 --> 21:29.157
Man: Should have never
let 'em out.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.898
Man #2: Yeah, man,
just heard...
You freak.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.422
This is your fault!It was Negan!
Negan killed her!

21:33.466 --> 21:35.381
Lydia:  No, he didn't
do anything wrong.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.383
No, it wasn't --
He didn't do anything.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.732
Now get him
out of here!Please.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.560
Move!
No, he didn't
do anything wrong!

21:40.603 --> 21:42.039
I know. I know.
I know. I know. I know.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.303
He didn't
do anything wrong.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.827
No, please!
Oh, please, no.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.351
Please.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.136
Hold that
right there.

22:35.179 --> 22:36.920
Easy, now.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.748
Hey.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.318
Okay.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.755
All good?

22:45.799 --> 22:48.454
I'll be back.

22:51.718 --> 22:55.461
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.553
Lydia.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.994
He was so sweaty.

23:07.037 --> 23:10.432
Never liked deodorant.

23:11.564 --> 23:15.785
Said it --
it made his armpits itchy.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.658
So I got used to it.

23:21.443 --> 23:24.359
Sometimes he smelled like
garlic and onions.

23:26.143 --> 23:29.408
I miss him.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.062
Who's that?

23:33.629 --> 23:36.676
My dad.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.160
My dad
would've protected me.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.084
Tell me what happened.

23:56.478 --> 23:59.612
Negan saved my life.

24:16.629 --> 24:19.719
Man:
...on the wall there.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.678
Negan:
How's the kid doing?

24:22.722 --> 24:26.639
She's banged up,
but she'll be alright.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.772
You know,
the people out there

24:29.816 --> 24:31.861
are talkin' about
puttin' you down,

24:31.905 --> 24:34.690
sayin' Rick ain't around
to save you no more,

24:34.734 --> 24:37.911
maybe they should have done it
a long time ago.

24:39.216 --> 24:44.483
If you came here looking
for a confession...

24:44.526 --> 24:46.963
just keep walking.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.575
It was an accident.

24:49.618 --> 24:52.795
And for the record,
screw her.

24:52.839 --> 24:56.712
She was a goddamn asshole
beating on a kid.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.714
World's better off.

24:59.759 --> 25:02.762
But you already know that,
don't you?

25:03.980 --> 25:06.679
You came down here
to look me in the eye

25:06.722 --> 25:08.985
because you don't know
what to do with me.

25:09.029 --> 25:13.686
Shit, all that time you spent
fantasizing about my death,

25:13.729 --> 25:16.427
all that time
you actually tried to kill me,

25:16.471 --> 25:17.777
and now look at you.

25:18.821 --> 25:21.781
You're not so sure.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.611
You listen to me
real close.

25:25.654 --> 25:29.440
You and I ain't never
been in a room before,

25:29.484 --> 25:30.746
not toe to toe.

25:30.790 --> 25:34.707
And there ain't nobody
to save you right now.

25:34.750 --> 25:38.014
What do you want me to do,
Daryl?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.104
I mean,
the people out there --

25:41.148 --> 25:42.671
they are out
for blood.

25:42.715 --> 25:43.846
Guys like you and me --

25:43.890 --> 25:46.936
we can smell that
from a mile away.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.504
Why help Lydia?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.941
You ain't no hero.

25:51.985 --> 25:55.205
No.
No, I'm not.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.294
I'm a sucker.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.733
See, I started believing in
your way of life,

26:00.776 --> 26:03.083
your moral code.

26:03.126 --> 26:05.694
Hell, you even gave me
a little taste of freedom,

26:05.738 --> 26:07.566
just so
you could yank it away

26:07.609 --> 26:10.090
when I actually did
the right thing.

26:10.133 --> 26:13.528
You gotta admit,
that is pretty messed up.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.660
And we both know

26:14.703 --> 26:17.793
I appreciate
some messed-up shit.

26:17.837 --> 26:21.580
You're gonna get your chance
to tell your side.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.541
Who's the sucker now?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.501
Daryl: Hey.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.634
Carol: Hey.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.550
How you feelin'?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.899
Sore.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.858
I bet.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.121
I heard
what happened.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.602
Yeah.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.300
It's a mess.

26:47.083 --> 26:50.086
Everybody's talking about
Negan again.

26:51.435 --> 26:55.091
It's like
time never moves.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.400
What do you think?

26:59.443 --> 27:02.272
I don't give a shit
about him.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.407
I believe her,
though.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.888
I do.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.196
This is
a distraction.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.678
Hilltop's got a tree
through its walls.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.767
Alexandria was attacked.

27:18.811 --> 27:22.118
Oh, we don't
know that yet.

27:23.685 --> 27:27.297
Our real enemy
is out there.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.824
There's enough
bad stuff happening here.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.696
I'm afraid
if we don't fix it,

27:34.740 --> 27:38.134
it ain't gonna matter
what she does to us.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.269
There won't be
anything left.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.228
Should have gone
to New Mexico.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.669
Yeah.

28:13.866 --> 28:17.739
Man: Put together
the last one now!

28:31.579 --> 28:33.712
Jerry: Yo!

28:33.755 --> 28:35.104
We got all our peeps!

28:35.148 --> 28:36.845
Get back in here!

28:36.889 --> 28:40.066
Alright.
Just keep coming!

28:40.109 --> 28:41.545
We got to
get out of here.

28:41.589 --> 28:44.113
Luke!
Magna, let's go!

28:46.376 --> 28:48.422
Come on!
We have to
protect the wall!

28:51.381 --> 28:53.427
We need help!Yumiko: No,
there's no time.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.733
Hey!

28:54.776 --> 28:57.126
If we stay out here,
we die.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.780
Everybody, let's go!

28:58.824 --> 29:00.913
We've got to
get out of here!

29:00.956 --> 29:02.741
Come on!

29:05.047 --> 29:08.964
Miko!

29:24.632 --> 29:26.765
Close the gates!

29:26.808 --> 29:29.724
Come on!
Close them!

29:42.302 --> 29:44.870
Defend the breach!

30:25.475 --> 30:27.913
Everything alright?
I've been tryin' to reach you.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.089
Rough day,
but things are looking up.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.831
What's going on?

30:32.874 --> 30:33.919
Something happened.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.225
Gabriel:
Lydia lured you there?

30:36.269 --> 30:37.966
Gage: Yeah. You saw what she did
with the squirrel.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.968
She's psycho.Alfred: And Negan
was with her.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.752
If you thought
Lydia was crazy,

30:41.796 --> 30:45.060
why'd you agree to meet her
back there in the dark?

30:46.627 --> 30:48.368
Well, um...
Well --

30:48.411 --> 30:50.936
Hey, we're the ones
who were attacked here.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.590
But she's the one
laying in the infirmary.

30:53.634 --> 30:58.030
And our friend
is in a grave.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.814
Negan's on the right side
this time.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.903
I don't know if it's gonna make
any difference, though.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.993
Should I come home?

31:05.037 --> 31:09.258
No, not if Hilltop
still needs you.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.438
How's Lydia?

31:15.482 --> 31:16.875
Not good.

31:16.918 --> 31:19.616
Daryl,
you have to protect her.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.792
Yeah, well,
I'm trying.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.055
No.

31:23.098 --> 31:26.623
You have to protect her
for all of us.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.756
When we went
to the border,

31:28.799 --> 31:31.672
we went there
to de-escalate the conflict

31:31.715 --> 31:34.066
and buy time
and strategic advantage.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.982
And it was working
till Carol took her shot.

31:37.025 --> 31:40.072
Alpha could have killed us
right there.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.074
Why didn't she?

31:42.117 --> 31:44.815
You think she won't attack
if we got Lydia?

31:44.859 --> 31:46.992
Alpha wanted you
to protect her.

31:47.035 --> 31:51.083
Look, Lydia's presence
might not help us,

31:51.126 --> 31:53.433
but if Alpha thinks
she isn't safe with us

31:53.476 --> 31:56.175
or if Lydia runs off
because of all this,

31:56.218 --> 31:57.916
it'll definitely
hurt us.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.179
She has to stay
at Alexandria.

32:00.222 --> 32:03.356
Alright.
I'll make sure.

32:03.399 --> 32:07.099
Let's just keep this
between us for now.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.540
How's RJ?

32:13.583 --> 32:15.107
He's great.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.065
He won't eat
his vegetables,

32:17.109 --> 32:19.328
so I'm a little
afraid for him.

32:24.377 --> 32:27.946
Hey, the council's meeting
right now.

32:27.989 --> 32:29.556
Daryl...

32:29.599 --> 32:32.515
I want you to be my proxy
when they vote.

32:34.561 --> 32:36.955
Alright.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.305
I should go.

32:39.348 --> 32:42.438
I know you'll do
the right thing.

32:53.188 --> 32:54.494
Rachel:
Oceanside to Hilltop.

32:54.537 --> 32:57.105
Come in, Hilltop.
Pick up, please.

32:57.149 --> 33:00.152
Hilltop copies.
This is Michonne.

33:00.195 --> 33:03.546
Aaron: I get why people might
think Negan's been redeemed.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.375
I've...

33:06.419 --> 33:08.464
I've wondered it myself.

33:08.508 --> 33:12.120
Hell, he --
maybe he has changed.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.122
But a man like that,

33:14.166 --> 33:17.386
who's done
the things he's done,

33:17.430 --> 33:20.302
killed the people's
he's killed --

33:20.346 --> 33:23.044
something inside him
is broken.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.133
We need to face
that fact.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.136
Siddiq: Yes, but killing him now
over this

33:28.180 --> 33:31.183
undermines the civilization
that we have built.

33:31.226 --> 33:34.142
What about the people who
never got to witness that
civilization because of him?

33:34.186 --> 33:36.536
And what the hell
are you even talking about?

33:36.579 --> 33:38.886
The Whisperers
are attacking us.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.410
Okay,
let's take a break.No.
Let me finish.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.369
Look at what's going on
at Hilltop.

33:43.412 --> 33:46.067
We're taking our eyes
off the ball.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.156
The council wasn't made
for this,

33:48.200 --> 33:51.159
deciding on a man's life
in the dead of night

33:51.203 --> 33:53.335
because people are carrying
pitchforks and torches.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.773
I -- Look,
if you can't make a decision,

33:56.817 --> 33:59.124
the people out there
are gonna make one for you.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.823
Well,
what'd Michonne say?

34:02.866 --> 34:05.130
She wants me
to be her vote.

34:05.173 --> 34:09.830
Lydia said Negan saved her,
so he saved her.

34:09.873 --> 34:11.484
I'm a "no."

34:11.527 --> 34:12.833
So we're tied.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.531
Gabriel,
where do you stand?

34:25.237 --> 34:27.195
I'm gonna take the night
to clear my head

34:27.239 --> 34:28.805
and consider my vote,

34:28.849 --> 34:30.720
and I suggest
you all do the same.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.202
Michonne: I'd like to head out
right away,

34:34.246 --> 34:36.378
two wagons,
some supplies.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.946
Yumiko: Rachel's sure
it was them?

34:38.989 --> 34:41.209
"Sure" is a strong word,
but she swears

34:41.253 --> 34:43.733
that one of those creepers
were watching them,

34:43.777 --> 34:46.345
too damn close to where
that mask washed up.

34:46.388 --> 34:49.739
It might be nothing,
but in case it is one of them,

34:49.783 --> 34:52.177
you know as well as I do
they move as a pack.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.613
Where there's one,

34:53.656 --> 34:55.876
you can bet your last dollar
there's a hundred more,

34:55.919 --> 34:58.139
much like the order
of Blattodea.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.141
Ah, the illustrious
cockroach family.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.668
So, you think they're planning
another attack?

35:05.712 --> 35:07.279
Walkers at Alexandria,

35:07.322 --> 35:10.369
the tree here,
and now Oceanside?

35:10.412 --> 35:11.892
First time,
coincidence.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.415
Second time
might be bad luck,

35:13.459 --> 35:15.504
but the third time,
we should check.

35:15.548 --> 35:16.897
Michonne?

35:16.940 --> 35:18.681
Uh, if -- Uh,
if you don't mind,

35:18.725 --> 35:21.293
I-I'd love
to join you.

35:21.336 --> 35:24.426
I'm feeling the ocean
calling to me.

35:24.470 --> 35:29.170
And, um, by "ocean,"
you mean Jules?

35:29.214 --> 35:31.912
What are you
talking about?

35:31.955 --> 35:33.653
Never even heard of her.Mm-hmm.

35:33.696 --> 35:36.525
Oh, yes, of course,
the very tall woman...

35:36.569 --> 35:37.657
Yeah.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.876
...with the f-face
and quiet -- Yeah.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.922
Count me in, too.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.445
In that case,
Eugene,

35:43.489 --> 35:46.492
you'll need to lead a wagon
back to Alexandria.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.885
Actually,
I'll be staying put.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.323
Much like
my amigo here,

35:51.366 --> 35:53.281
I feel an energy
calling to me,

35:53.325 --> 35:55.109
urging me on
to help our good neighbors

35:55.153 --> 35:58.025
by employing my expertise
in architecture and engineering

35:58.068 --> 35:59.505
to plug
the metaphorical gap tooth

35:59.548 --> 36:01.159
in the
metaphorical smile

36:01.202 --> 36:03.422
that is
the Hilltop's fortification.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.339
You want
to fix the wall.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.559
Yes.

36:10.603 --> 36:13.127
Fine.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.476
We'll bring back
some supplies

36:14.520 --> 36:16.739
so you can
do it faster.
Apologies.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.306
The only caveat being

36:18.350 --> 36:20.700
that I cannot escort Judith
back to Alexandria.

36:20.743 --> 36:21.962
Oh, Judith?

36:22.005 --> 36:23.355
She's coming with me.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.792
I am?
Well, yeah.

36:25.835 --> 36:28.447
Who else is gonna be
my pair of friendly ears?

36:35.236 --> 36:36.629
Man: Yeah.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.022
I'll see you later.

36:39.066 --> 36:42.069
Hey.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.505
We did it.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.204
We got everybody out
in time.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.336
We could've have taken
those walkers.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.425
We had a split-second decision
to make --

36:50.469 --> 36:52.993
Youmade the decision.

36:53.036 --> 36:56.170
Look,
when shit hits the fan,

36:56.214 --> 36:58.868
somebody's got to
step up.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.218
So, yeah,

37:00.261 --> 37:03.003
I -- I listen
to what everybody has to say,

37:03.046 --> 37:04.483
I weigh it all up --

37:04.526 --> 37:07.399
And then you do
what you were gonna do anyway.

37:09.444 --> 37:12.317
Where the hell
is all of this coming from?

37:12.360 --> 37:16.756
You're not
my lawyer anymore.

37:55.403 --> 37:58.450
Daryl: What?

37:58.493 --> 38:00.278
He's gone.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.813
Gabriel: The guards say
the keys are missing.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.859
Whoever stole them
must've let him out.

38:19.645 --> 38:21.908
Who was on watch
last night?

38:21.951 --> 38:23.388
Laura was,

38:23.431 --> 38:25.999
but she said she didn't do it,
and I believe her.

38:26.042 --> 38:29.959
Man:
I'd be worried.

38:30.003 --> 38:33.093
I did it.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.835
I let Negan out.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.637
Come on.
You didn't do this.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.204
Yeah, I did.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.510
I kept watch
last night.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.426
You never
left the house.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.822
Does it matter?

39:08.389 --> 39:10.304
This is
where they want me.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.611
Doesn't matter
what they want.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.527
You know,
for a long time,

39:15.570 --> 39:18.399
I blamed myself
for what happened last year.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.663
Kept thinking,

39:21.707 --> 39:25.406
what if I just stayed
in that cell at Hilltop?

39:25.450 --> 39:28.148
If I never
let myself be taken alive

39:28.191 --> 39:30.237
by you people
in the first place?

39:30.280 --> 39:33.675
Never went off
with Henry?

39:33.719 --> 39:37.200
Never said
what I said to my mother?

39:37.244 --> 39:39.377
You're not to blame
for her.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.030
My mother was right.

39:41.074 --> 39:46.166
She said you people
put on these polite faces,

39:46.209 --> 39:47.602
but it's just a mask

39:47.646 --> 39:51.258
'cause when things
get bad...

39:51.301 --> 39:55.523
when you get scared...

39:55.567 --> 40:01.311
you pick a target,
aim, and shoot.

40:03.618 --> 40:06.969
Me, Negan,
anything but you.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.797
Negan's different.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.799
You didn't know him.

40:10.843 --> 40:12.540
The Negan I know

40:12.584 --> 40:14.803
stood up for me
when he didn't have to.

40:17.893 --> 40:21.549
I tried fitting in.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.813
I wanted
to be like you.
