12:24.036 --> 12:27.574
Well, I help out my son
at his florist shop and nursery,

12:27.664 --> 12:30.997
andJared came in to buy
an orchid for his mother.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.075
He was full ofanxiety.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.583
- Probably about microbes,
Booth.
- Uh, afraid of germs.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.335
I picked out an orchid,
and I took it out to his car,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.417
and he was very appreciative.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.003
And— [ Laughs]
I thought he wasjust adorable.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.841
So I asked him out to dinner,
and the rest is history.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.599
He fell in love with me,
and I responded.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.598
/ared’s mother thought he was
at the hotel writing his book,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.105
but there’s no record
ofhim checking in.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.687
He was at the hotel,
but for a conference.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.398
Right, with the, uh,
science-fiction writers.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.404
No, for behavior modification.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.406
Ifhe was trying
to overcome his—

13:08.497 --> 13:10.579
If he was trying to overcome
his psychological issues,
that might’ve threatened her.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.954
- With your support?
- Of course.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.162
Look, I only wanted
what was best forJared.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.167
I’m not a crazy person.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.508
I’ve looked at the remains
over and over, and I can’t
find any cause ofdeath.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.806
Without the head,
we may never discover
cause ofdeath.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.477
And without cause ofdeath,
it’s much less likely
that we’ll solve the crime.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.055
This fracture on
the right metacarpal,
on the last two fingers?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.641
It’s got a nickname:
the boxer’s fracture.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.194
It happens ifyou slug someone
without keeping your wrist
dead straight.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.693
So—

13:45.826 --> 13:49.569
How did you know that?
I fought Golden Gloves
when I was a kid.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.200
You x-ray my hand,
it don’t look much different
than this.

13:52.290 --> 13:56.124
I don’t expect anyone to
live up to Zack’s standards,
Mr. Bray,

13:56.211 --> 13:58.497
but that is
extremely good work.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.086
Mery
have you ever conducted
a sexual relationship...

14:04.177 --> 14:07.544
with a woman over 20 years
older than yourself?

14:11.226 --> 14:13.933
I ask because,
anthropologically speaking,
there’s a correlation...

14:14.021 --> 14:18.185
between
physically aggressive young
males and sexual precocity.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.441
Um, I’m pretty sure you aren’t
any 20 years older than me,
Dr. Brennan.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.864
Why would my age
be relevant?

14:29.578 --> 14:33.617
Very good work
on the boxer’s fracture.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.998
[Zack]
What’d you bring me, Hodgins?

14:41.089 --> 14:43.205
Huh?

14:43.300 --> 14:46.292
Try and figure this one out.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.550
Well, a lemma on its own
is difficult to solve because
the solution changes...

14:50.640 --> 14:55.430
dependent upon whether or not
the subsequent proposition
is auxiliary or subsidiary.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.476
So I got you beat,
right?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.397
[Inhales Sharply]
Yep. That makes me
king ofthe—

15:01.735 --> 15:03.566
That-That makes me king.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.857
We’re gonna get you
outta here someday, Zack,
and you can be king again.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.443
I know you’re lying
to make me feel better
and not to be malicious.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.076
Want to hear about the case
we’re working on now?
Body in 12 pieces.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.537
- And get this— no head.
- So 13 pieces.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.921
The linear functional must
be bounded before you apply
the R/esz represen ta t/on.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.970
- What?
- The characteristic polynomial
ofa differential operator...

15:32.057 --> 15:35.015
is not the same thing as
the characteristic polynomial
ofa matrix.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.099
You solved it?
Yes.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.429
I’m king of the loony bin.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.480
Yeah, you are.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.606
Hey, I got an idea.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.688
I’m gonna leave
the case file with you.

15:49.783 --> 15:54.117
It’s got all the X-rays so far,
all the data. Maybe you’ll find
something we missed, huh?

15:54.204 --> 15:56.786
I’ve done that
many times in the past.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.116
Angela says you and she
aren’t together anymore.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.957
Yeah, you know—

16:05.048 --> 16:07.539
I’m sorry things
are going badly foryou.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.627
- [ Laughing]
- Why are you laughing?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.588
My best friend is locked up
in a loony bin,

16:14.683 --> 16:17.049
wearing gloves because
he blew up his own hands,

16:17.144 --> 16:19.977
and he feels sorry for me.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.142
[Laughing]

16:25.360 --> 16:27.271
Mud is not dangerous.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.444
Mud’s not toxic.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.522
Mud’s not poisonous.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.868
Mud will not hurt you.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.820
What you’re gonna do is
dip your hand in the bucket,
and you’re gonna mix it around.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.660
- [Whimpers]
- Do it!

16:41.751 --> 16:45.243
took at the hematoma on his
left ocapital. It’s what
you would call a shiner.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.045
I know, Bones.
Now, take that muo’.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.045
Rub it on your arms,
your legs,

16:51.136 --> 16:54.469
yourstomach, your feet.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.298
- Get it in there!
let’s go. let’s go.
- [Man] No. I can’t.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.678
Come on, ladies.
Guys, on the chest.
It’s not gonna hurt ya!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.676
No. No.
Come on!

17:01.813 --> 17:04.771
I can’t do it. I can’t. I—
All right,
who’s in control, Ralph?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.516
You or the O.C.D.?
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.940
Do you want to be ordered
around by a disorder?
No.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.443
I want order, not disorder.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.195
I have been where you are, man.
I have felt your fears.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.197
Now, look at me now
You can do it too.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.952
- Ralph?
- Oh! We got a runner.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.455
You think you want
to follow Ralph .7A// of you?

17:25.545 --> 17:29.754
But you don’t want to do that!
You do not want to do that.

17:29.841 --> 17:33.129
I know.
Because I’m one ofyou.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.634
Excuse me.
Maybe you’d like to follow me?
I have a few questions for you.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.182
I’m a professor of psychology
at the University of Maryland.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.262
I received a grant to conduct
trial research on methods
of reforming O.C.D. behavior.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.938
WasJared Addison
one ofyour students?

17:47.025 --> 17:50.643
I’m bound by patient
confidentiality.
I’m sure you understand.

17:50.737 --> 17:55.151
Jared was chopped
into pieces and tossed away
into an industrial pool.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.608
That’s not one ofyour
therapy exercises now, is it?

17:57.702 --> 18:00.318
Oh, wow. Oh, God.

18:00.413 --> 18:05.533
Ah, yes. Yes,Jared was—
was one of mine.

18:05.627 --> 18:10.337
He, uh— / believe
he was making progress
despite severe misophob/a.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.256
- Misophobia. Right. Which is—
- The germ phobia.

18:13.343 --> 18:17.086
- [Whispers] Right.
- He’d hold a flame under his
fingertips after shaking hands.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.171
He’d literally
burn the germs away.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.507
When was the last time
you sanared?
/t was Thursday afternoon.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.092
He took off right after we
completed the toilet exercise.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.811
You mean,
he went to the bathroom?
No.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.856
Each participant
is required to pick a mint
out ofthe toilet...

18:29.943 --> 18:32.275
and hold it on their tongue
for 10 seconds.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.775
MaybeJared gave you that shiner
after you made him suck
on a toilet mint.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.902
- We know he struck someone
with his right hand.
- Yeah,just like this.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.610
Right there! You see?
Right there like that.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.696
I was punched by
another participant...

18:43.790 --> 18:46.532
who had an extreme reaction
to the floor-licking exercise.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.330
Is it common for patients
to attack you?
It happens.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.254
There’s a lot
of stress involved.
People break.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.797
Some people would see
what you do as torture.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.296
Yeah. Maybe whenJared
let you down, you broke.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.378
Let me down?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.758
Jared was my star patient.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.466
It’s a tragedy he died
before he could fully enjoy
his new freedoms.

19:04.561 --> 19:09.430
- Excuse me?
- Uh, it’s okay, Ralph.
We’ll try again tomorrow.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.231
I’m not here to apologize,
Professor Amerian.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.777
I’m here to confess.
I killedJared.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.319
Can you please
sterilize your handcuffs
before taking me in?

19:28.668 --> 19:32.001
[Sweets] I want to say
for the record that you’re
here ofyour own volition...

19:33.882 --> 19:36.669
Why are you letting Sweets
conduct this interrogation?
Crazy guy, shrink—

19:36.760 --> 19:38.625
It’s a no-brainer.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.008
Are we gonna let Sweets
interrogate all of
our insane suspects?

19:42.098 --> 19:45.465
Annoying, isn’t it, Sweets?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.594
Why did you kill him?
I didn’t mean to kill him.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.647
The fact is, if! don’t
eat at exactly 8:14 am.
according to this watch,

19:52.734 --> 19:54.725
the person
nearest to me dies.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.778
Professor Amerian told me
not to eat till 9:00 am.
according to this watch,

19:58.865 --> 20:00.821
andJared was sitting
next to me.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.275
And you believe
that’s what killed him?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.112
When you lock me up,
I should either keep my watch,

20:06.206 --> 20:09.744
or you should only put me
next to terrible people
who deserve to die.

20:09.834 --> 20:14.999
-Did you by any chance dismember
Jared after you killed him?
-No. Ijust killed him.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.502
[Booth ]
Oh, no.
We gotta keep looking

20:17.592 --> 20:23.007
IfJared was having breakfast
with Ralph, how come he never
showed up to that day’s session?

20:23.139 --> 20:27.098
Ralph, where did Jared go after
you had breakfast together?
To the coffee bar in the lobby.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.471
- Why?
- To get coffee.

20:29.562 --> 20:34.682
Hodgins found coffee grounds
and sea kelp in the treads
ofJared’s shoes.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.439
What can I get ya?
A sample
ofyour grounds.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.901
Just take ’em, Bones.
It’s garbage. You don’t
need a warrant for garbage.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.908
- What’s goin’ on?
- F.B.I. Special Agent Booth.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.035
Do you, uh,
recognize this guy?

20:52.127 --> 20:54.209
[Scoffs]
What did he do—
lodge a complaint?

20:54.295 --> 20:57.662
Because I never
actually hit the guy.

20:57.757 --> 21:01.875
- I pushed him in the chest with
maybe two fingers. A nudge.
- Why did you push him?

21:01.970 --> 21:06.509
The dude had me wash my hands
with antibacterial soap before
I started on his cappuccino.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.555
Then he had me
redo it three times...

21:08.643 --> 21:12.761
because the cup
was dirty on the outside,
which it was not.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.142
Look at my cups.
Pristine.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.392
So you pushed the dude
for insulting your cups?
No.

21:18.486 --> 21:23.401
All ofthese OC/DC people
are the same— complaining.

21:23.491 --> 21:27.200
Eve/y day I’m throwing out
perfectly good coffee.
I’m going bankrupt.

21:27.287 --> 21:32.327
He did it to me one too
many times, and I cracked.
Call it a crime of passion.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.791
So was that the last time
you saw him?
Nope.

21:34.878 --> 21:39.622
Guy came by here the other day
and we made nice. Thursday.

21:39.716 --> 21:44.460
He apologized to me.
He even shook my hands without
putting on rubber gloves.

21:44.554 --> 21:48.843
- He was like a different guy.
- Professor Amerian’s methods
were working.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.049
Oh, God. Please keep that
under your hat.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.055
[Scoffs]
That’s all I need—

21:53.146 --> 21:56.138
is for this place to become
the coffee mecca
for the phobics.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.855
Hey. Wendell, come in.

22:07.035 --> 22:10.277
- What can I do for you?
- You said come to you
with questions.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.406
I owe people money.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.539
That’s not technically
a question, so there’s
not much for me to go on.

22:18.630 --> 22:22.248
What I gotta do is keep
my nose clean, graduate
at the top of my class...

22:22.342 --> 22:24.754
and get a good job
so I can pay off
that debt.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.302
You’re worried about getting
fired because you can’t satisfy
Dr. Brennan, right?

22:28.389 --> 22:30.846
Never mind.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.925
Wendell—

22:33.019 --> 22:36.887
Wendell, hold on.
You never actually
asked me a question.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.018
That guy— the psycho who
helped the serial killer—

22:40.109 --> 22:42.725
Could you please
not call Zack a psycho?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.902
Crazy as it sounds,
we all still love him.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.489
He was
Dr. Brennan’s boy toy, right?
Wh-What?

22:48.576 --> 22:50.908
Boy toy as in... sexual?

22:51.829 --> 22:54.957
[Laughs]
N-No.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.783
Where did you get—
No. Absolutely not.

22:57.919 --> 23:01.753
Plus the FBI. guy.
Again, no. Wrong.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.714
Well,
then she hit on me.
I don’t think so.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.759
She looked me right in the eyes
and asked if! had any
experience with older women.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.219
It’s, like, ifyou want to work
around here, you gotta—
Wendell, stop.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.513
You need to look for some
alternative explanation...

23:12.600 --> 23:15.307
for what you think happened
between you and Brennan.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.681
And ifyou can’t
think ofanything,
then you shouldjust...

23:17.772 --> 23:20.639
assume you’re
hallucinating or insane.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.894
Because she absolutely
didn’t hit on you.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.398
I’m glad we talked.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.246
You like driving my car.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.790
It’s too big.
Why do you need
such a big car?

23:39.877 --> 23:42.835
Last week, I transported
six prisoners, and they
were all very comfortable.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.458
You care if prisoners
are comfortable?

23:44.549 --> 23:47.757
Once I have the bad guys
in custody, I—

23:47.844 --> 23:49.630
I feel very kindly
toward them.

23:52.807 --> 23:55.549
When I said “bad guys,”
you thought of Zack, didn’t you?

23:55.643 --> 23:58.100
- How did you know that?
- You shouldn’t do that.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.724
- Why?
- Why? Because Zack’s
not a bad guy.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.147
- He killed someone.
- He wasn’t in his right mind.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.940
He was in the same mind
he’s always had.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.144
That mind has never
been right.

24:07.238 --> 24:11.447
took, brain chemist/y, Bones—
sometimes it gets
the better of us.

24:12.994 --> 24:17.328
Do you think that underneath
all ofhis compulsions
and obsessions,

24:17.415 --> 24:19.280
Jared Addison
was a different person?

24:19.417 --> 24:23.376
Don’t you?
No. We are who we are,
including brain chemistry.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.579
Everything else isjust
theoretical.

24:25.673 --> 24:30.007
Mmm. Our own true best selves
are always theoretical.

24:35.475 --> 24:39.093
- [Brennan]
C an /ask you a question?
- Wow. There’s a first, huh?

24:39.187 --> 24:41.223
You never ask
ifyou can ask a question.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.225
Go ahead, yeah.
Ask away.

24:43.316 --> 24:48.401
Okay, unscientifically,
with a completely
nonempirical bias...

24:48.488 --> 24:51.776
requiring no supporting
evidence or logical argument—

24:51.908 --> 24:54.615
You meanjust going
offfeelings?
Yes.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.819
When you first heard
that Zack killed someone,
what did you think?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.825
That it couldn’t be true,
that it was a mistake.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.328
- Thank you.
- Thank you? For what?

25:02.418 --> 25:06.411
[Exhales] No. Thank— I—
I wasjust thanking you
for answering the question.

25:06.506 --> 25:10.044
No, you weren’t. You thanked me
because you believe that Zack
has a true best self.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.625
Zack’s true best selfwould
never kill another person.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.214
Exactly. Huh.
Won that argument
pretty handily.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.592
What? Were we arguing?
No, no. Don’t do that.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.768
You only say it wasn’t
an argument when I win.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.811
I didn’t think
we were arguing.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.481
I won. You said, “Thank you.”
That means I won.

25:27.610 --> 25:31.068
I had no idea—
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.109
Winner, winner. Bing, bing!
I am not buying you
a chicken dinner. Got it?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.317
You get anything off
the victim’s cell phone?

25:37.412 --> 25:39.494
I was able to recreate
a call list from the SIM.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.866
[Typing]

25:41.958 --> 25:44.791
[Saroyan ]
He only called one number.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.414
[Ange/a ]
Once a day for 30 days
at exactly the same time.

25:47.547 --> 25:51.836
Who is it?
I called the number
and recorded the answer.

25:51.926 --> 25:54.918
[ Woman]
Forward Retro Publishing.
Howma y / direct your call?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.295
Does that mean
anything to you?
Yes.

25:57.390 --> 26:01.804
Forward Retro is the publisher
who dropped Jared Addison
after his second book—

26:01.894 --> 26:03.885
the one who never wanted
to talk to him again.

26:15.700 --> 26:19.488
The publishing game has changed.
You know what I mean,
Dr. Brennan.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.612
No, I do not.
Well, try me,
Mr. Tushman.

26:22.707 --> 26:26.165
Book-wise, it’s no longer
about good writing per se.
It’s about marketability.

26:26.294 --> 26:28.455
Ofthe book?
Ofthe author.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.458
There’s a reason why your photo
takes up the entire back cover
of your books.

26:31.591 --> 26:34.173
Because I’m
a very good writer.
You’re serviceable.

26:34.260 --> 26:38.799
But your success is
contingent upon your image
as a hot scientist chick.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.842
That’s not true, is it?
No, of course not.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.141
Don’t call my partner a chick.
What’s the matter with you?

26:44.228 --> 26:48.187
Fine, fine. Got it.
The point is, I had to hire
a guy to pretend to beJared.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.642
This guy?
Yeah. C.D. Howe.

26:53.738 --> 26:57.697
The deal I had with CD. was
to let him write his own stuff.
And you know what? It was good.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.819
He started selling.
Sol had to choose
betweenJared and CD.

26:59.911 --> 27:02.948
So you had no contact with
Jared Addison after firing him?

27:03.039 --> 27:07.453
- Absolutely none.
- Yeah, that’s a lie.
He called you every day.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.579
Whoa, Bones! Oh!

27:09.670 --> 27:11.706
Ask him what happened
to his tooth.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.129
All right, that’s assault.
Are your hands clean?

27:14.258 --> 27:17.625
Yeah. My partner wants to know
what happened to your tooth.
Jared Addison punched him.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.258
I admit to that
cause-and-effect situation.

27:21.349 --> 27:24.762
- Why’d he punch you?
- Probably because he said
Jared was a bad writer.

27:24.852 --> 27:29.892
/ didn ’t k/l/jared.
But you think / did because
of a minor physical altercation.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.359
Okay, go ahead.
You know what?

27:32.485 --> 27:36.194
Explain yourself.
All right.Jared came
into my office.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.692
And he told me
he was cured of his O.C.D.

27:38.783 --> 27:42.492
He mentioned,
um, toilet candy?

27:43.788 --> 27:46.746
Uh, he said he was willing
to go out on the road,

27:46.832 --> 27:48.959
hustle the books
however I wanted.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.580
I told him I wasn’t interested.
I heard it all before.

27:51.671 --> 27:54.504
And then he clocked me one.
It didn’t hurt.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.876
And then I told him
that I would take on his book.

27:56.968 --> 27:59.129
Why did you change your mind
after he hit you?

27:59.220 --> 28:01.461
So if! punched you,
you’d read my manuscript?

28:01.556 --> 28:05.890
/ared hit me with his bare hand
The old jared A ddison
would’ve never done that.

28:05.977 --> 28:08.810
You believed he was cured?

28:08.896 --> 28:12.514
Can you imagine the sales
I’d have gotten out of revealing
the realJared Addison?

28:12.608 --> 28:15.065
Mmm!
I’d have made a fortune.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.153
Dr. Hodgins?

28:23.244 --> 28:24.950
Shh!

28:25.079 --> 28:28.492
My egg from the victim’s
shoes is hatching.
You need quiet for that?

28:28.583 --> 28:31.199
No. Ijust thought it might
stop you from talking.

28:31.294 --> 28:34.832
Pushing it, Dr. Hodgins.
How’s about we say
you found the line?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.677
This fly might tell us where
Jared Addison was murdered.

28:43.764 --> 28:47.427
Oh, look, look, look!
Hey, there, little buddy.

28:47.518 --> 28:51.431
This is a white fly.
Only lives in very warm,
humid climates.

28:51.522 --> 28:55.515
Jared Addison’s
old-lady girlfriend
used to work at a nursery.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.942
Hey, Dr. Saroyan.

28:58.029 --> 29:01.567
I’m not moving
into Zack’s space.
I’m not being difficult.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.490
Ijust—
/ can ’t do it.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.408
I hope you understand.

29:07.538 --> 29:10.280
I understand.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.866
I thought you being
the one who moved in there
would be easiest for Zack.

29:13.961 --> 29:18.455
Well, if he were a normal human,
that might be true. But—

29:19.592 --> 29:21.799
Yeah.

29:25.514 --> 29:29.473
Okay, here’s the thing.
This new guy Wendell?
He might be nuts.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.677
- Hi, Angela. Pickle?
- He thinks Brennan hit on him.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.763
Why does he think that?

29:34.857 --> 29:38.691
He said she asked him if he
was interested in having sex
with an older woman.

29:38.778 --> 29:42.817
Which is impossible. Which
I set him straight about in no
uncertain terms, believe you me.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.815
I’m certain she did
exactly that.
No, no.

29:45.910 --> 29:49.027
I’ve known Brennan for years.
And there’s no way,
believe me, that she ever—

29:49.121 --> 29:52.579
Our murder victim
was 28 years younger
than his girlfriend.

29:52.667 --> 29:58.082
Dr. Brennan was probably looking
for insights in her, you know,
clumsy yet endearing way.

29:58.172 --> 30:02.085
You might want to let Wendell
know that you misjudged him
in no uncertain terms.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.258
Hmm.

30:04.345 --> 30:08.338
Well, Wendell also says
that he owes a lot of people
a lot of money...

30:08.432 --> 30:11.424
and that he really
needs thisjob—
like the mob or something.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.726
Oh, no, no, no.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.351
Unless it’s rampant paranoia,
not myjurisdiction. But on
the other thing, I’m solid.

30:17.441 --> 30:21.275
You know, the last time
I listened to you,
you broke up me and Hodgins.

30:21.404 --> 30:22.735
No.
Yeah.

30:22.822 --> 30:26.815
Angela,
that wasn’t my fault.
I think you know that.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.362
Yeah.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.910
[Whispers]
Yeah.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.913
So what do we think?
Here, huh?

30:39.046 --> 30:41.082
Yeah, what do you think?
Oh, yeah.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.256
This is definitely
an environment conducive
to the white fly.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.922
[Booth Whistles]
I’ll start taking
some samples.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.796
Can I help you?
Yeah. F.B.I.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.506
We, uh, have a warrant here
to search the premises.

30:52.643 --> 30:55.760
Is this about
Jared Addison’s murder?
Yep.

30:55.855 --> 31:00.269
No, no. Bones, don’t touch that.
There’s tons ofdisgusting
stuffand chemicals—

31:00.359 --> 31:03.101
Not here. Our fertilizer’s
a hundred-percent organic.
It’s my own blend.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.858
[ Groans] There you go. Now
you’re gonna get sick Your
stomach ’s gonna go upside down.

31:06.991 --> 31:08.606
It’s gonna be a mess.
Coffee.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.324
Coffee?
Sea kelp
and coffee grounds.

31:10.411 --> 31:12.823
Jared Addison was here
shortly before he died.

31:12.913 --> 31:17.122
Jared was my mom’s boyfriend—
heavy emphasis on the “boy.”

31:17.209 --> 31:19.916
Yeah. Well, we heard
that this place kind of
freaked him out.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.120
All the germs, yeah.
But he was here.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.626
I don’t know ifit was
the dirt that made him squirm
or the question,

31:24.759 --> 31:27.000
but the kid
toughed it out.
What question?

31:27.136 --> 31:30.674
He wanted my permission
to marry Mom.
And what was your answer?

31:30.765 --> 31:34.974
I told him I thought it would be
creepy to have a stepfather
who’s 10 years younger than me.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.473
- I told him he should forget
about it and try to be normal.
- You told him no?

31:38.564 --> 31:41.647
I said no, he could not
have my blessing.

31:41.734 --> 31:46.068
He ’5 lucky / didn ’t conk him
on the head and chop him up
for fe/t/l/zer But / didn ’t.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.817
White flies.
I’ll do some lab work,

31:48.908 --> 31:51.524
but they look to be
the exact strain
that / hatched at the lab.

31:51.619 --> 31:55.407
-/’m sor/y. But did you just say
you did conk him on the head?
-I said I didn’t.

31:55.539 --> 31:56.494
Booth?
Yeah?

31:56.582 --> 31:58.994
- Flies on the shovel.
- Oh.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.871
We know that flies
are attracted to manure, blood—

32:02.004 --> 32:04.666
Hmm.
The flies are mostly
on this shovel.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.089
It follows that
there’s something
different about this one.

32:07.176 --> 32:10.043
Will that warrant
let me test the shovel?

32:10.137 --> 32:12.253
Well, yeah.
It’s out in the open,
so it’s fine.

32:12.348 --> 32:15.010
I’m going to use
phenolphthalein.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.591
/t 7/ tell us ifthere ’5
blood present on the shovel

32:24.652 --> 32:27.894
What’s pink mean?
It means you caved in
Jared Addison’s skull.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.479
And/or removed his head.

32:30.574 --> 32:34.158
I’m gonna have to ask you
to close up shop
and take you downtown.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.281
We have a few questions
we’d like to ask you.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.379
Somebody as smart as you
should know better.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.136
Oh, I don’t smoke.
Ijust—

32:58.227 --> 33:00.263
[Clears Throat]
I don’t smoke.

33:00.354 --> 33:05.348
So... you weren’t totally wrong
about Dr. Brennan.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.479
I can’t risk having sex
with my boss.
Like I said, I got debts.

33:08.571 --> 33:11.404
No, no.
Not totally wrong, I said.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.527
When she asked you about your
experiences with older women,

33:14.618 --> 33:16.950
her interest
was anthropological.

33:17.037 --> 33:20.029
- She was looking me
right in the eyes.
- She’s direct...

33:20.124 --> 33:22.080
and awkward.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.658
Now, you’ve
got two choices here.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.495
You either answer the question
like me or Zack.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.878
Or you tell her she ’5 being
inappropriate l/ke Booth or C am.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.380
Either way, she’s not gonna
hold it against you.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.677
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.841
Frankly, I’m, uh,
more worried about
the money—owing thing.

33:40.978 --> 33:44.766
I can pay my debts.
Yeah, but you can’t work
on legal cases...

33:44.899 --> 33:47.732
ifthe wrong kind of people
have leverage on you, right?
Wrong kind of people?

33:47.860 --> 33:50.567
What’s that supposed to mean?
Uh, no.
I’m trying to help, Wendell.

33:50.696 --> 33:53.153
It’s—
No, no. Ifthey’re the wrong
kind of people, then so am |!

33:53.282 --> 33:56.399
Could you please not yell?
My whole neighborhood ponied up
to send me to school!

33:56.493 --> 33:59.781
They’re working people.
They make money with their
hands. I need to pay them back!

33:59.872 --> 34:02.784
Oh. I—

34:02.875 --> 34:05.457
I-I thought you
owed the mob money.

34:05.586 --> 34:10.501
[Laughs]
Like we’re working on a mob case
and you owe the mob money?

34:10.633 --> 34:12.919
[Laughs]
I don’t owe the mob money.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.544
Yeah. See the problem?
And I don’t smoke.

34:17.890 --> 34:21.178
When I gotta think, I ask myself
what my dad would’ve done.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.805
You know,
he smoked all the time.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.932
Holding this CIgarette—
/t’s stupid okay.

34:26.023 --> 34:28.264
But it helps me
get into his head.

34:28.359 --> 34:31.977
But he died of lung cancer,
so... I do not smoke.

34:32.071 --> 34:36.405
Wow, Wendell.
Once you start talking, it’s—

34:36.533 --> 34:40.367
Wow.
I don’t get you people.

34:40.454 --> 34:44.618
I’d like to work here,
but it’s like a minefield—
too many ways to step wrong.

34:44.708 --> 34:47.825
I admit it takes
some getting used to.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.161
Good luck.

34:56.053 --> 34:59.386
[Saroyan]
It wasn’t blood.
On the shovel, it wasn’t blood.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.259
[ Booth]
Bones’s magicjuice didn’t work.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.466
No. Phenolphthalein
is not magic.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.972
- It’s an indicator
that reacts with—
- Potato proteins.

35:06.105 --> 35:09.472
Potatoes?
Phenolphthalein turns pink
in the presence of potatoes.

35:09.608 --> 35:13.692
I locked the guy up
because of potatoes.
He might’ve done it, Booth.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.067
But we all know that without
the victim’s head, we aren’t
likely to solve this murder.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.899
- Well, maybe Wendell here
missed somethin’ in the bones.
- I didn’t.

35:19.994 --> 35:24.829
- Don ’t blame Wendell
He ’5 domg ve/y well
- I just wish Zack were here.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.871
You gotta get over it.
Zack’s not coming back.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.792
I know where to find
the victim’s head.

35:30.838 --> 35:34.046
This is not good.
How did you get out?

35:34.133 --> 35:37.546
- You don’t appear
happy to see me.
- Oh, we’re not.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.469
Well, I am. I really am.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.467
Zack/

35:42.599 --> 35:44.180
Hey, buddy.
Aww.

35:44.268 --> 35:47.226
- Well, I doubt he got
a weekend pass.
- Zack, how’d you get out?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.849
[ Kisses]
Dr. Sweets helped me.

35:49.940 --> 35:53.103
Oh, well, then I totally
change my mind about Sweets.
I now love him.

35:53.193 --> 35:57.152
- Does Dr. Sweets know
that he helped you?
- No.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.192
You’re hurting my arm.
Oh, sorry.

35:59.283 --> 36:02.446
Zack, you’re with me and Bones.
The rest ofyou go play
with your microscopes.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.243
- Let’s go.
Bone Room now. March.
- Come on.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.163
[Zack]
Eve/ything In the room
is organized in sets of 72.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.162
A dozen shoes in the closet,
a dozen action figures
on the shelf,

36:11.253 --> 36:13.039
a dozen pencils
in the pencil holder.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.836
Even books are grouped
by the dozen.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.835
[Together]
I should’ve noticed that.

36:17.926 --> 36:20.838
Sets of 1 2 must
be a manifestation
ofJared Addison’s O.C.D.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.922
I did an analysis ofhis novels.
There’s no recurring sets
of numbers.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.099
Only recurring images of germs
and fear of microbes.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.643
Okay, then what is with
the number 12?

36:29.730 --> 36:33.439
They live at
12 Kindergarten Street.
Kindergarten has 12 letters.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.484
Alphanumeric is also a
1 2-letter word, by the way, but
I suspect that’sjust ironic.

36:37.571 --> 36:39.277
Okay, this side of him
I don’t miss at all.

36:39.364 --> 36:43.027
Books, CDs, everything.
It’s always 12.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.860
In the yard,
everything comes in 12—

36:45.954 --> 36:50.664
paving stones, plants,
decorative rocks, gnomes—
always 12.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.454
Oh.
What?

36:52.544 --> 36:55.126
Well,Jared Addison wouldn’t
have been gardening.
He’s a germophobic.

36:55.214 --> 36:58.126
Even his name,
Jared Addison—
12 letters.

36:58.217 --> 36:59.832
- Oh.
- What?

36:59.927 --> 37:02.043
He didn’t name himself.
His mother did.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.595
- His mother has O.C.D. too?
- That’s the most
reasonable conclusion.

37:05.682 --> 37:08.765
But the body
was found in 12 pieces,
not counting the head. Why?

37:08.852 --> 37:13.516
The incomplete saw marks
on the C2 vertebrae
were hesitation marks.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.815
She couldn’t deal
with the part ofthe body
that was her child’s face.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.858
You— You used me to escape?

37:19.655 --> 37:22.192
- How?
- Your card.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.524
Sweets, one crime at a time.
Murder first, okay?
Why’d she kill her son?

37:25.619 --> 37:27.860
He was overcoming
his disorder.

37:27.955 --> 37:31.072
Jared Addison was
ready to take control
of his professional life.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.249
He’d found love
and was ready
to leave her house.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.544
It wasn’tjust his patterns
he was destroying.
It was hers.

37:37.631 --> 37:42.295
And as a result,
she suﬂ’ered a psychotic break
and murdered her own child

37:42.386 --> 37:43.967
You know,
I still have my card.

37:44.054 --> 37:48.172
I swapped out the magnetic strip
with my loony bin library card.

37:48.267 --> 37:51.509
- Wait.
That’s why it didn’t work?
- Zack, where isJared’s head?

37:51.603 --> 37:57.143
Everything comes in twelves—
everything except for... this.

we’d do this together.

What if he overpowers me, or—
Zack?

I’m much stronger
than I look.
He’s done it before.

40:52.326 --> 40:54.942

Okay, Zack. Promise you’re
not gonna kill Sweets.

Y-You confessed to plunging
a knife into a man’s chest.

41:24.066 --> 41:27.979
No. I said I killed him,
which I did. I told the master
where to find the man.

41:28.070 --> 41:30.652
But you didn’t plunge a knife
into the man’s chest?

41:30.781 --> 41:33.989
It wasn’t me.
Zack, why did you confess?

41:34.076 --> 41:37.614

Ifthe master had asked,
I would have done it.

I’ve had question marks.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.589
Because you at heart
are not a killer.

41:51.718 --> 41:55.586
I gotta— I gotta tell
Dr. Brennan and Booth.
You can’t tell them.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.547
Because I’m your patient
and you’re not allowed,
ethically.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.554
Zack, don’t you want
your friends to know that
you didn’t kill anyone?

42:01.645 --> 42:03.761
I’m still an accessory
to murder.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.562
Ifyou tell them,
they’ll take me out of here
and put me in prison.

not do well in prison.
Okay.

What about the person that
actually did commit the murder?
He’s still out there.

42:12.614 --> 42:16.527
No. The master killed him
so he could recruit me.

42:16.618 --> 42:19.325
- There can only ever be two.
- You have to let me
tell the truth.

without my permission.
