00:23.754 --> 00:25.489
Are you sure

00:25.556 --> 00:27.759
this is New York City?
Yeah, absolutely.

00:27.826 --> 00:30.395
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
this here is, uh, Broadway.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.066
What's that street sign say?
"Gator Avenue."

00:32.066 --> 00:34.534
Hmm. I wonder how far
Gator Avenue is from Broadway.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.270
According to this map,

00:36.337 --> 00:37.705
2,000 miles.

00:37.773 --> 00:39.507
Well, in that case,
we're going to need

00:39.575 --> 00:41.443
to fill up the tank.

00:50.289 --> 00:52.557
Hello? Hello,
anybody there?

00:52.625 --> 00:54.360
Hello?

00:56.163 --> 00:58.031
Puddles!

00:58.099 --> 01:01.002
Come back!

01:05.308 --> 01:07.409
Hmm, Hmm.

01:07.477 --> 01:09.078
Hmm.

01:09.145 --> 01:10.412
Mm-hmm.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.980
Puddles?

01:22.626 --> 01:24.660
Gator man!

01:24.728 --> 01:26.728
Oh, sweetie,
there's no such thing as...

01:29.899 --> 01:33.002
Gator man!

01:39.010 --> 01:41.345
Puddles!

02:17.021 --> 02:19.690
Scooby-dooby-doo!

02:31.737 --> 02:33.605
Oh, I am so bored.

02:33.672 --> 02:36.507
We haven't had a good mystery
in I don't know when!

02:37.509 --> 02:39.076
Fred,
I think I've read

02:39.144 --> 02:41.445
every magazine in your house.

02:41.513 --> 02:43.247
What's that?

02:44.049 --> 02:46.150
No, don't!

02:46.218 --> 02:47.551
Dohh!

02:47.619 --> 02:49.320
"Traps illustrated"?

02:49.388 --> 02:50.722
Freddy!

02:50.789 --> 02:53.458
I, uh, I read it
for the articles.

02:53.526 --> 02:55.794
In fact, it's where
I got the idea

02:55.862 --> 02:58.096
for this little beauty.

02:58.164 --> 02:59.531
Who do you expect

02:59.599 --> 03:01.100
to trap outside
your front door?

03:06.407 --> 03:08.942
Let's find out.

03:10.244 --> 03:12.679
I got a package
for, uh, Fred Jones.

03:12.747 --> 03:14.581
Hey, that's me.

03:18.319 --> 03:21.121
Ahh--oh!

03:22.857 --> 03:24.290
What is it?

03:25.793 --> 03:27.427
Like, um,

03:27.495 --> 03:29.562
I think it's a box.

03:33.033 --> 03:35.901
It's from Mr. E!

03:38.472 --> 03:40.974
"Saved this for a rainy day.

03:41.042 --> 03:42.575
Enjoy."

03:42.643 --> 03:45.078
Hmmph, Mr. E
gives me the creeps.

03:45.145 --> 03:48.081
Fred, careful.
That could be a bomb.

03:48.148 --> 03:50.918
Ooh, strike that.
Cute purse.

03:50.985 --> 03:52.486
Check it out--

03:52.554 --> 03:55.289
"100% pure gator,
made in Gatorsburg."

03:55.357 --> 03:56.691
Gatorsburg?

03:56.759 --> 03:58.293
But that's impossible.

03:58.361 --> 04:01.430
Gatorsburg hasn't manufactured
gator products in decades.

04:01.498 --> 04:03.666
Not since the gator mines
dried up.

04:03.734 --> 04:06.503
Gator mines?

04:06.571 --> 04:08.939
Gatorsburg was founded
back in the 1800s,

04:09.007 --> 04:11.075
when a group of prospectors
searching for gold

04:11.142 --> 04:13.110
struck something
much more valuable--

04:13.178 --> 04:15.346
alligator.

04:15.414 --> 04:18.949
Yeah! We're all gonna be rich!

04:25.190 --> 04:28.792
Gatorsburg had more alligators
than anywhere in the world.

04:28.860 --> 04:31.761
Overnight, Gatorsburg
became a boomtown.

04:31.829 --> 04:35.198
The town became famous
for its gator skin products.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.901
Then the gator wells ran dry.

04:38.969 --> 04:41.837
Gatorsburg became a ghost town.

04:41.905 --> 04:43.338
But, like, Freddy,

04:43.406 --> 04:45.440
it says it was made
in Gatorsburg.

04:45.508 --> 04:48.509
Ooh, smells new.

04:48.577 --> 04:51.445
Gang, we have a mystery
on our hands.

04:51.513 --> 04:54.515
Oh, sweet Christmas, finally!

04:59.287 --> 05:00.954
Oh, boy!

05:13.503 --> 05:15.871
This is what happens
when a civilization is founded

05:15.939 --> 05:18.074
on an entirely
gator-based economy.

05:18.142 --> 05:19.442
All right, gang,

05:19.510 --> 05:21.511
let's split up
and look for clues.

05:21.579 --> 05:23.847
What do you say, shaggy?

05:23.915 --> 05:26.350
Want to go clue hunting
with me?

05:26.418 --> 05:27.618
Velma!

05:27.686 --> 05:29.854
Come on, not in front of Scoob!

05:29.922 --> 05:31.623
Hmm?

05:31.690 --> 05:33.258
I didn't touch it!

05:33.325 --> 05:36.427
Why, dude, how about
we check out gator burger?

05:36.495 --> 05:40.098
Sounds delicious!

05:46.304 --> 05:48.406
Like, jackpot, Scooby-doo!

05:48.473 --> 05:50.908
Ahh!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.143
Hmm?

05:52.210 --> 05:53.811
Oooh.

05:56.281 --> 05:58.482
We need to talk.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.751
Velma, like,
I would love to,

05:59.818 --> 06:01.653
but, like,
I can't hear anything

06:01.720 --> 06:03.487
over the sound
of my own stomach.

06:03.555 --> 06:06.157
It's going, "like, maybe
give me a triple with cheese

06:06.225 --> 06:07.258
"and chili,

06:07.326 --> 06:08.693
and, like, a pickle."

06:08.760 --> 06:10.328
You know what?
Forget it.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.498
Velma, wait up!

06:14.566 --> 06:16.100
Like, velm, what did I do?

06:16.168 --> 06:17.368
Nothing.

06:17.436 --> 06:20.104
You didn't do anything.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.074
So, me not doing anything
is the thing

06:23.142 --> 06:25.009
that you're mad about?

06:25.077 --> 06:28.780
Like, why do girls
have to be so confusing?

06:28.848 --> 06:31.149
Let's go, gang,
there's nothing to trap here.

06:31.217 --> 06:34.519
Looks like Mr. e.
Sent us on a wild goose Chase.

06:34.587 --> 06:37.322
Ah, yeah, more like
a wild gator Chase!

06:37.390 --> 06:39.157
Ha ha!

06:40.693 --> 06:42.827
Hmm, that's weird.

06:42.895 --> 06:45.330
Can you tell
what the problem is, fred?

06:45.398 --> 06:46.998
You see that hole there?

06:47.066 --> 06:49.333
That should be an engine.

06:57.777 --> 07:01.813
You kids are in
some serious trouble!

07:08.501 --> 07:11.637
Care to tell me what
you're doing in Gatorsburg?

07:11.704 --> 07:13.305
Our van broke down.

07:13.373 --> 07:15.040
Maybe you could
take a look at it.

07:15.108 --> 07:17.443
You look like you've got
the hands for the job.

07:17.510 --> 07:19.878
Hey, what size
is your ring finger?

07:19.946 --> 07:22.481
Why the heck
should I help you?

07:22.549 --> 07:25.584
Because you're...
A mechanic?

07:25.652 --> 07:29.088
TouchÃ©.

07:29.923 --> 07:31.557
Here's your problem.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.426
Engine's missing.

07:33.494 --> 07:37.063
I'm gonna have to order
a new one from crystal cove.

07:37.131 --> 07:39.232
Seeing as that's
over 3 miles away,

07:39.300 --> 07:41.034
it won't arrive until morning.

07:41.102 --> 07:42.836
So, like,
you're saying we're stuck

07:42.904 --> 07:45.839
in this super creepy
gator town all night long?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.943
Hello?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.644
Hello?
Yes?

07:50.712 --> 07:52.814
Hey, mom,
we're stuck in Gatorsburg.

07:52.881 --> 07:55.450
The van broke down.
Think you can come and get us?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.352
Oh, I wish I could,

07:57.420 --> 07:58.820
but tonight's race night.

07:58.888 --> 08:00.389
You know me and horses.

08:00.456 --> 08:02.157
Venus is in
its third retrograde,

08:02.225 --> 08:04.926
which means I'm betting
on sick little monkey to show.

08:04.994 --> 08:07.094
Well, lentil
and mushroom caps, fred!

08:07.162 --> 08:09.963
I've already got the recliner
in the reclined position.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.998
There's no going back
from that.

08:13.067 --> 08:15.268
Oh, sweetie,
it's dark out.

08:15.336 --> 08:18.038
I can't go out
in the dark!

08:22.176 --> 08:24.477
You have reached
the Rogers' residence.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.045
We're busy right now.

08:26.113 --> 08:27.714
Please call back.

08:27.781 --> 08:29.416
Ohh, wait. Duh.

08:29.483 --> 08:31.251
It's still life night.

08:31.318 --> 08:33.720
Guess we're here
for the whole night.

08:33.788 --> 08:36.356
And Scooby-dooby, too.

08:36.423 --> 08:39.359
Don't suppose you could
recommend a hotel?

08:39.427 --> 08:42.863
My sister greta
runs the best in town--

08:42.931 --> 08:44.731
the drowsy gator.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.369
Oh, and a word of advice--

08:49.436 --> 08:52.638
don't leave your rooms.

09:05.352 --> 09:06.786
Hmm?

09:09.023 --> 09:11.957
Raggy, raggy!
Huh?

09:13.794 --> 09:17.262
Huh?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.468
Hmm.

09:45.590 --> 09:48.792
We ain't got no rooms.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.628
But your sign
in the window says, "vacancy."

09:51.696 --> 09:54.230
Well, that sign's broken.

09:54.298 --> 09:56.166
But it's a painted sign.

10:01.639 --> 10:03.807
Gunther, we got guests!

10:09.381 --> 10:11.016
Well!

10:11.083 --> 10:14.019
Hello!

10:14.087 --> 10:17.690
This is my son,
gunther gator.

10:17.758 --> 10:20.259
I'm greta gator.

10:20.327 --> 10:23.729
Your last names are gator
and you live in Gatorsburg?

10:23.797 --> 10:25.431
What a coincidence!

10:25.498 --> 10:28.300
Yeah, coincidence.

10:33.505 --> 10:35.539
Uh, we don't get many guests

10:35.607 --> 10:37.574
here at the drowsy gator.

10:37.642 --> 10:39.509
Shocker.

10:47.152 --> 10:51.123
Like, are those claw marks?

10:51.191 --> 10:54.694
I don't see any marks.

10:59.801 --> 11:02.436
I got a few hotel rules.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.338
Rule number one--

11:05.406 --> 11:07.507
boys and girls
in separate rooms,

11:07.575 --> 11:09.342
no exceptions!

11:09.410 --> 11:11.244
Then I guess
I'm with you, Daphne.

11:11.312 --> 11:14.747
I said, no exceptions!

11:14.815 --> 11:16.549
But I'm a girl.

11:16.617 --> 11:20.086
Oh, right.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.521
Rule number two--

11:21.588 --> 11:24.424
stay in your rooms,
no matter what you hear.

11:24.491 --> 11:26.492
That includes screams,
moans, wails,

11:26.560 --> 11:27.960
pounding, clawing, scratching,

11:28.028 --> 11:29.629
and anything
that sounds like a body

11:29.696 --> 11:32.431
being dragged
across a hardwood floor.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.768
Ok...

11:36.836 --> 11:38.569
Well, shag, looks like
you, me and Scoob

11:38.637 --> 11:39.937
are in this room.

11:40.005 --> 11:41.606
I almost forgot!

11:41.673 --> 11:43.274
Rule number three--

11:43.341 --> 11:46.276
no pets in the hotel!

11:46.344 --> 11:48.646
What?!

11:48.714 --> 11:50.448
Hmm, Hmm, Hmm.

11:50.515 --> 11:51.916
It's ok, Scoob.

11:51.983 --> 11:53.817
You can sleep
in the mystery machine.

11:53.885 --> 11:55.719
It's just one night,
Scooby-doo.

11:55.787 --> 11:57.520
I'll see you
in the morning, buddy.

11:57.588 --> 11:59.089
I hope so!

12:07.099 --> 12:09.301
I'm not a pet.

12:12.171 --> 12:15.942
Is there something different
about your bangs?

12:16.009 --> 12:18.711
I raised them
a half centimeter
to bring out my forehead.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.946
Toodles.

12:20.014 --> 12:21.882
Where you going?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.150
I, uh, forgot something.

12:24.218 --> 12:25.218
What?

12:25.286 --> 12:27.987
I forget.

12:28.055 --> 12:30.156
Hmm.

12:30.223 --> 12:32.458
You know, shag, when we all
graduate from High School

12:32.525 --> 12:34.292
and move in together,

12:34.360 --> 12:37.028
we can get a room
just like this.
You like bunk beds?

12:37.096 --> 12:39.197
I can't think about that
right now, fred!

12:39.264 --> 12:41.198
Like, I'm really worried
about Scoob!

12:41.266 --> 12:43.734
Well, I'd say check on him
if it weren't for the fact

12:43.802 --> 12:45.904
that we were warned
to stay in our rooms.

12:45.971 --> 12:49.474
Hey, do you prefer flannel
or cotton sheets?

12:49.542 --> 12:51.443
Shaggy?

12:52.745 --> 12:54.213
Oh!
Uh, oh.

12:54.281 --> 12:55.948
Velma.

12:56.016 --> 12:59.085
Were you sneaking over
to see me?

12:59.153 --> 13:00.353
Um, yeah.

13:00.421 --> 13:02.256
Like, I wanted to see you.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.125
But Freddy told me
I had to go check on Scooby-doo,

13:05.193 --> 13:07.327
so I'm doing that.

13:07.395 --> 13:11.365
Trust me, Scoob is just fine.

13:17.739 --> 13:20.308
Raggy?

13:26.415 --> 13:28.116
Huh? Daphne?

13:28.184 --> 13:30.585
I'm looking for velma.

13:30.653 --> 13:32.354
Have you seen her?

13:32.421 --> 13:34.490
No, but I'm glad you're here.

13:34.557 --> 13:36.159
I have something for you.

13:36.226 --> 13:37.727
You do?

13:37.795 --> 13:40.964
It's just a little memento
of our time together.

13:41.032 --> 13:43.666
Oh, Freddy!
A scrapbook!

13:43.734 --> 13:46.502
I bet it's filled
with wonderful pictures of...

13:46.570 --> 13:47.903
Traps?!

13:47.971 --> 13:50.773
We used this one
to catch the phantom
of vasquez castle.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.541
Yeah, I remember.

13:52.608 --> 13:55.510
And this baby helped us nab
carlotta the gypsy.

13:55.578 --> 13:57.646
Mm-hmm. I was there.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.414
And this one...

14:04.920 --> 14:07.288
No monsters,
no monsters, no--

14:19.569 --> 14:20.869
Huh?!

14:22.439 --> 14:23.906
Raggy! Raggy!

14:23.974 --> 14:25.475
Help!

14:43.173 --> 14:44.941
Come on, come on,

14:45.009 --> 14:46.376
come on, come on, come on!

14:51.514 --> 14:53.382
And I left a few pages blank.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.017
You know, for future traps.

14:55.085 --> 14:56.352
Good thinking.

14:58.354 --> 14:59.822
Scoob! What's the matter?

14:59.889 --> 15:02.825
He's trying
to tell us something.

15:02.892 --> 15:04.226
Tator people.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.995
Uh, crater steeple?

15:08.065 --> 15:10.399
Skater feeple!
Gator people!

15:10.467 --> 15:12.202
Phew. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

15:21.146 --> 15:22.681
Quick, on the bed!

15:23.983 --> 15:26.251
Oh, oh!
No!

15:27.954 --> 15:29.588
Oh, fred!

15:29.656 --> 15:31.890
Aah!
My scrapbook!

15:31.958 --> 15:33.158
Aah!

15:33.225 --> 15:34.792
Oh, fred.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.663
This is it.
There's no escape!

15:40.165 --> 15:41.398
I've got an idea.

15:41.466 --> 15:43.267
Quick, guys,
the comforter.

15:51.441 --> 15:54.077
Wow, look at this.

15:54.145 --> 15:56.046
No fred, no Daphne,

15:56.113 --> 15:57.747
no Scooby.

15:57.814 --> 15:59.415
Just us.

15:59.483 --> 16:02.218
Mmm!
Hmm.

16:02.286 --> 16:04.888
Raggy!

16:06.691 --> 16:08.458
Scooby-doo!

16:08.526 --> 16:10.394
What's going on?

16:10.462 --> 16:12.797
Gator people!
Come again?

16:12.865 --> 16:14.632
Shh.

16:20.940 --> 16:23.008
Maybe they're gone.

16:25.011 --> 16:26.679
Oh!

16:53.272 --> 16:56.241
Move toward the door,
very slowly.

17:00.746 --> 17:04.516
Whoa! Oh! Ahh!

17:04.584 --> 17:05.784
Velma!

17:05.852 --> 17:07.252
Shaggy!

17:08.521 --> 17:11.624
Oh! You saved me!

17:11.692 --> 17:13.726
I did? Oh!

17:13.794 --> 17:15.627
Like, I did.

17:15.695 --> 17:17.364
Zoinks!

17:17.432 --> 17:18.699
No!

17:20.835 --> 17:22.736
That's disgusting.
Oh!

17:22.804 --> 17:25.640
Wait! That isn't real.

17:25.707 --> 17:27.541
It looks like
part of a costume.

17:38.586 --> 17:40.587
Scooby, get behind the wheel.

17:40.655 --> 17:41.588
Huh?

17:41.655 --> 17:43.356
But the mystery machine
is broken!

17:43.424 --> 17:45.425
Which is why
we're going to push it.

18:07.451 --> 18:09.952
Look! They're stopping.

18:15.459 --> 18:16.792
They weren't trying
to eat us.

18:16.860 --> 18:18.327
They just want us out of town.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.429
Why?
I don't know.

18:20.497 --> 18:22.330
But if we're going
to solve this mystery,

18:22.398 --> 18:24.233
we have to go back into
Gatorsburg.

18:24.301 --> 18:25.468
Say what?

18:28.372 --> 18:30.307
Like, it's them.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.517
Huh?

18:39.585 --> 18:41.620
"100% pure gator."

18:41.687 --> 18:44.924
This belt is just like
the purse Mr. e sent us.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.093
Let me see that.

18:51.666 --> 18:52.766
What happened?

18:52.833 --> 18:54.701
I'm allergic
to imitation animal skin.

18:54.769 --> 18:56.102
Pleather, fake fur--

18:56.170 --> 18:58.638
it all makes me break out.

18:58.706 --> 19:00.841
That belt
isn't 100% pure gator.

19:00.909 --> 19:03.877
It's a fake.
They're all fakes.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.679
So, like,
those fake gator people

19:05.747 --> 19:07.715
are selling fake gator products?

19:07.782 --> 19:11.318
Dude! We are dealing
with serious irony!

19:11.386 --> 19:13.520
We have to stop them.

19:16.691 --> 19:19.359
Like, dude, you gator freaks!

19:19.426 --> 19:21.927
You're, like,
the ugliest crocodiles ever!

19:21.995 --> 19:25.331
Who are you calling
a crocodile?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.665
Get them!

19:35.175 --> 19:36.609
Now!

19:57.298 --> 19:59.532
Got 'em.

20:00.568 --> 20:03.169
Old 45, gets 'em every time.

20:10.943 --> 20:14.712
Time to find out who these
greedy gators really are.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.948
Grady gator?

20:18.016 --> 20:20.418
Greta gator?

20:20.485 --> 20:22.019
Gunther gator?

20:22.087 --> 20:23.253
But why?

20:23.321 --> 20:25.188
After we ran out of gators,

20:25.256 --> 20:28.358
everybody moved out
of Gatorsburg.

20:28.425 --> 20:29.525
But not us.

20:29.593 --> 20:31.194
This here is our home.

20:31.262 --> 20:32.896
So, with no alligators left,

20:32.964 --> 20:34.832
you decided to make
imitation gator products

20:34.899 --> 20:36.867
and pass them off as real.

20:44.110 --> 20:48.281
But you couldn't have anyone
snooping around Gatorsburg.

20:50.151 --> 20:52.219
So, you created
the creeping creatures

20:52.287 --> 20:54.588
to scare people away.

20:56.491 --> 20:58.592
Then you could run
your counterfeit gatoring

20:58.660 --> 21:01.428
whatever anyone knowing
who you were
or what you were up to.

21:01.496 --> 21:04.731
Why, that is
one ridiculous plan.

21:04.799 --> 21:05.966
And you know what?

21:06.033 --> 21:07.834
We would have
gotten away with it, too,

21:07.902 --> 21:10.103
if it weren't
for you meddling juveniles

21:10.171 --> 21:12.373
and your unauthorized
investigation

21:12.440 --> 21:16.409
of our synthetic
gator accessories.

21:16.477 --> 21:19.312
You're tellin' me
this gator stuff is fake?!

21:19.380 --> 21:21.748
I paid a fortune
for this tracksuit!

21:21.816 --> 21:22.982
Sorry, sheriff.

21:23.050 --> 21:26.252
Man,
I gotta get out of this suit.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.254
This fake gator
doesn't breathe.

21:28.322 --> 21:31.657
I'm starting to smell
a little...

21:31.725 --> 21:33.926
Funky.

21:33.994 --> 21:35.762
Arrest them,

21:35.830 --> 21:40.935
even though I have absolutely
no jurisdiction here!

21:45.775 --> 21:48.244
Wait, sheriff,
can you give us a ride?

21:48.311 --> 21:49.945
The mystery machine isn't--

21:53.283 --> 21:55.384
Like, there's no engine
in the mystery machine!

21:55.452 --> 21:56.819
It's haunted!

22:00.090 --> 22:02.825
It's from Mr. e.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.995
"Hope you had a good time
in Gatorsburg.

22:07.063 --> 22:10.129
"But be warned--there are
more mysteries to come.

22:10.139 --> 22:12.539
This is only one piece
of the puzzle."

22:12.549 --> 22:15.449
Puzzle?
What's that supposed to mean?

22:15.459 --> 22:18.559
Like, I've got a bad feeling
we're going to find out!
