but to what end?

35:19.943 --> 35:21.031
What's your objective here?

35:21.075 --> 35:22.642
We want Brady Hartsfield gone.

Shipped to Crestmore.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.732

35:25.775 --> 35:27.516

threw herself off your roof.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.822
And landed at your feet.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.302
And another of your volunteers
killed his dog

35:30.345 --> 35:31.955

all over the porch.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.276
some interesting data
has crossed my desk.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.191
Every time there's a story
on Hartsfield, they mention

35:50.235 --> 35:51.366
Mercy Gen'.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.759
Every magazine article.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.543

not local.

35:56.632 --> 36:00.549
ER walk-ins at St. John's,
down 9%.

36:00.593 --> 36:04.118
And guess how much ER walk-ins
that Mercy Gen' are up.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.164

Radiology, PT --

36:06.207 --> 36:08.862
all fall into
the same upward trend.
