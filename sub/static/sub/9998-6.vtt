<i>It's the question</i>
<i>we ask each other</i>

00:05.270 --> 00:08.005
<i>when a moment comes along</i>
<i>that's so powerful,</i>

00:08.055 --> 00:10.641
<i>so utterly huge,</i>

00:10.709 --> 00:14.445
<i>that everyone everywhere</i>
<i>feels the same thing.</i>

00:17.182 --> 00:19.784
<i>Whether we're consumed</i>

00:22.187 --> 00:23.888
<i>President Kennedy died...</i>

00:23.956 --> 00:26.857

<i>And for someone like me--</i>

00:40.072 --> 00:42.540
<i>all that emotion</i>
<i>floating around out there</i>

00:42.608 --> 00:44.342
<i>can be a powerful thing.</i>

00:44.409 --> 00:47.311
<i>I was way too young</i>
<i>to understand Watergate,</i>

00:47.379 --> 00:50.381
<i>but even so, I was so filled</i>
<i>with emotions</i>

00:50.449 --> 00:52.617
<i>that made no sense to me,</i>

00:52.684 --> 00:54.352
<i>I had to stay home</i>
<i>from preschool</i>

00:54.419 --> 00:56.354
<i>for two weeks</i>
<i>after the president resigned.</i>

00:56.421 --> 00:58.322
<i>You wouldn't think</i>
<i>a three-year-old</i>

00:58.390 --> 00:59.857
<i>could even be depressed,</i>

00:59.925 --> 01:03.361
<i>but there I was,</i>
<i>too disheartened to even move.</i>

01:03.412 --> 01:05.830
<i>On the other hand,</i>

01:05.897 --> 01:08.466
<i>when the Berlin Wall</i>
<i>finally came down,</i>

01:08.533 --> 01:11.202
<i>I didn't come down for a month.</i>

01:11.269 --> 01:13.904

01:13.972 --> 01:16.457
<i>Whatever the world is feeling,</i>

01:19.044 --> 01:21.212
<i>I just have to ride it out.</i>

01:23.982 --> 01:27.134
<i>But part of me</i>
<i>has always wondered,</i>

01:27.219 --> 01:31.856
<i>what if something happened</i>
<i>that was so big, so awful</i>

01:31.923 --> 01:34.892

Hey, Allison,
you all right?

02:20.238 --> 02:24.241
Yeah, I just had
a bad dream.

02:24.309 --> 02:26.544
Anything important?

02:27.946 --> 02:30.581
Just the end
of the world.

02:32.484 --> 02:35.186
Is there anyone
we should call?

02:37.856 --> 02:41.192
No, there's no one
I can think of.

02:42.994 --> 02:44.428
Then, come on.

02:44.496 --> 02:46.731
Let's go back to sleep.

02:49.334 --> 02:51.936

03:38.914 --> 03:41.496
Seismologists are saying
that last night's earthquake

03:41.568 --> 03:43.602
registered a 4.9
on the Richter scale.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.504
It is the third quake

03:45.572 --> 03:48.641
to strike Central Arizona
in the past week.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.676
4.9, huh?

03:50.727 --> 03:52.845
Is that big?
Mm.

03:52.913 --> 03:53.946
Yeah, that's big.

03:54.014 --> 03:55.414
That's, uh, big enough
to be on the news.

03:55.482 --> 03:56.415
What a rip-off.

03:56.483 --> 03:57.516
I didn't feel anything.

03:57.584 --> 03:58.617
Hey, we got
to get moving.

03:58.685 --> 03:59.785
You guys got to
get to school,

03:59.853 --> 04:01.353
and I got a place
I got to be.

04:01.421 --> 04:02.822
I don't know about that.

04:02.889 --> 04:05.825
Maybe we should stay
home from school.

04:05.892 --> 04:08.577
I mean, what if there's
another quake?

04:08.662 --> 04:10.096
Wouldn't you rather
have us here?

04:10.163 --> 04:11.197
Come on, Bridgette.

04:11.264 --> 04:12.748
You're going to
scare your sister.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.083
Wait. Bridgette.

04:14.167 --> 04:16.135
Look at your... your nails.

04:16.202 --> 04:18.803
When's the last time
you washed your hands?

04:18.872 --> 04:21.540
While many historians
will no doubt claim

04:21.608 --> 04:23.242
the decision of Americans

04:23.310 --> 04:25.444
to create a dual-chambered
legislature...

04:25.512 --> 04:26.879
known as a what, class?

04:29.282 --> 04:30.883
Mom, you okay?

04:30.951 --> 04:32.318
Yeah, baby.

04:32.385 --> 04:34.820
I'm fine. Just wash your hands.

04:36.423 --> 04:38.357
My nails are clean, Mommy.

04:38.425 --> 04:40.159
Yeah, I'm sure they are, baby.

04:40.227 --> 04:41.227
Mwah!

04:44.915 --> 04:46.282
All right, children.

04:46.366 --> 04:49.234
Time to clean up
and put everything away.

04:56.777 --> 04:59.628
Marie, honey, do you have
your art class today?

04:59.713 --> 05:01.547
No, not today.

05:01.598 --> 05:03.349
Okay. Here.

05:03.416 --> 05:04.817
Go put this in your backpack.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.753
As soon as we load these dishes,
we're out of here.

05:11.090 --> 05:12.725
There she is.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.994
You feel that quake
last night?

05:15.061 --> 05:16.629
Yeah, no, I just slept
right through it.

05:16.696 --> 05:17.613
How about you?
No.

05:17.697 --> 05:19.097
Lynn and I were sleeping
like babies.

05:19.149 --> 05:20.816
The baby,
on the other hand...

05:20.901 --> 05:22.968
that kid's got a set
of lungs on her.

05:23.036 --> 05:25.538
Anyway, we got quite
an interesting John Doe here.

05:25.605 --> 05:28.007
I was hoping you might be able
to lend a hand.

05:28.074 --> 05:29.575
Uh-huh.

05:29.643 --> 05:32.011
Actually, I'd settle
for a torso, a head,

05:32.078 --> 05:33.245
anything you can give me

05:33.296 --> 05:35.181
to help identify the
owner of this thing.

05:35.248 --> 05:36.448
Morgue humor.

05:36.516 --> 05:38.083
That's nice.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.552
Homeless guy found it

05:39.619 --> 05:41.587
while he was
Dumpster-diving last night.

05:41.638 --> 05:43.589
It was all wrapped
up in bubble wrap.

05:43.657 --> 05:45.291
M.E. says the
hand's from a male.

05:45.358 --> 05:47.359
Thinks it was chopped off
five or six days ago.

05:47.427 --> 05:49.361
Other than that,
we don't have much.

05:49.429 --> 05:51.096
Fingerprints don't match
anything in the system.

05:51.164 --> 05:52.965
Neither does the DNA.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.700
Is that a burn?

05:54.768 --> 05:56.468
Where?

05:56.536 --> 05:58.971
There.
You mean this?

06:14.020 --> 06:15.454
Allison? Hello?

06:15.522 --> 06:16.789
Is that what you're
talking about?

06:16.857 --> 06:18.891
You mean..
you mean this?

06:18.959 --> 06:20.392
No, no, no.

06:20.460 --> 06:23.095
This. This, uh...
that looks like a burn.

06:23.163 --> 06:24.263
That's a birthmark.

06:24.331 --> 06:26.131
I already checked with,
uh, Missing Persons.

06:26.199 --> 06:27.666
No one's filed a
report about anybody

06:27.717 --> 06:29.435
with a mark like
that on their hand.

06:30.904 --> 06:32.238
You okay?

06:32.305 --> 06:33.572
Yeah... no.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.608
What time do you have?

06:36.643 --> 06:38.027
10:10. Why?

06:39.045 --> 06:40.379
Anything else?

06:43.683 --> 06:47.286
Uh, I'm sorry that I
didn't have anything to...

06:47.354 --> 06:49.221
to offer you on the hand.

06:49.289 --> 06:50.990
Well, something
will turn up.

06:51.057 --> 06:53.692
Like maybe
the rest of him.

07:13.446 --> 07:15.447
Hey, Joe.

07:15.515 --> 07:16.782
Hi.

07:16.850 --> 07:18.417
Saw you pull up.
You got a second?

07:18.485 --> 07:19.818
Yes. Russ, absolutely.

07:19.886 --> 07:20.953
What's going on?

07:21.021 --> 07:22.888
Oh, it's Mrs. Halstead's
old house.

07:22.956 --> 07:25.090
Ever since the bank put it
into foreclosure,

07:25.158 --> 07:27.826
the lawn's turned
into Jurassic Park, and...

07:27.894 --> 07:29.061
and now I guess
some kids

07:29.129 --> 07:30.763
have figured out
the place is empty.

07:30.830 --> 07:31.997
Yeah.

07:32.065 --> 07:34.199
I-I saw some graffiti
there last week.

07:34.267 --> 07:35.467
Uh, it was gone
right away,

07:35.535 --> 07:37.336
so I guess the bank
painted it over.

07:37.404 --> 07:38.737
No, no, no. That was me.

07:38.805 --> 07:40.339
I've painted it twice now.

07:40.407 --> 07:41.974
Came out to get
the paper this morning,

07:42.042 --> 07:43.175
and there it is again.

07:43.243 --> 07:44.510
You know Judy and I

07:44.577 --> 07:46.211
put our place up
on the market, right?

07:46.279 --> 07:48.814
Every time a potential buyer
drives by, they take one look

07:48.882 --> 07:51.417
at that eyesore,
and they run the other way.

07:51.484 --> 07:53.052
It's killing my property value.

07:53.119 --> 07:55.220
It's killing all
of our property values.

07:55.288 --> 07:56.755
That's why I'm going around
asking everybody

07:56.823 --> 07:58.524
just to keep a lookout
for these idiots.

07:58.591 --> 07:59.692
Yeah, absolutely.

07:59.759 --> 08:00.893
I appreciate that.

08:00.961 --> 08:02.962
I mean, maybe one of us
will catch these punks

08:03.029 --> 08:04.630
in the act
and get them arrested.

08:04.698 --> 08:07.366
'Cause I swear I'm about ready
to camp on the front lawn

08:07.434 --> 08:09.401
with a flashlight
and a baseball bat.

08:09.469 --> 08:10.502
All right.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.004
You have a good night,
neighbor.

08:12.072 --> 08:13.939
Okay.

08:17.177 --> 08:18.277
Hey.

08:18.345 --> 08:19.645
I'm back here.

08:19.713 --> 08:22.047
Sorry, honey. Dinner's
going to be a little late.

08:22.115 --> 08:23.849
Oh, okay.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.084
Um... whoa.

08:25.151 --> 08:26.552
What's going on here?

08:26.619 --> 08:29.254
I'm just trying to get these
anchors into these pictures.

08:29.322 --> 08:31.123
I don't want them
to fall off the wall

08:31.191 --> 08:32.256
if there's an earthquake.

08:32.325 --> 08:33.892
Hey, listen,
I need you to help me

08:33.960 --> 08:35.126
strap some of the tall furniture

08:35.195 --> 08:36.761
to the wall
when I'm done with this.

08:36.830 --> 08:39.597
Al, we earthquake-proofed
the house a couple years ago.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.900
Yeah, I know,
but you can't be too prepared.

08:41.967 --> 08:44.035
Besides, I've been seeing
weird things all day.

08:44.104 --> 08:46.038
Every time I touch someone,

08:46.106 --> 08:48.374
I see where they are
at 9:18 in the morning.

08:48.441 --> 08:49.842
I mean, I don't know
which morning,

08:49.909 --> 08:51.643
but it always ends with shaking.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.381
Hmm.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.283
What are you doing?

08:58.335 --> 08:59.718
What does it look
like I'm doing?

08:59.786 --> 09:01.787
I'm helping you out.

09:03.423 --> 09:07.092
Okay, so... how does
this work again?

09:07.160 --> 09:09.395
You touch people, and
that's when you see this?

09:09.462 --> 09:10.729
Yeah.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.798
Oh. So touch me.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.434
It'll give you
another clue, right?

09:15.502 --> 09:16.668
Who knows? Maybe
you'll figure out

09:16.736 --> 09:18.003
what day this is
actually happening.

09:18.071 --> 09:19.438
Then we can
have a deadline

09:19.506 --> 09:21.940
for strapping all the
bookshelves to the wall.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.104
What?

09:52.172 --> 09:56.041
I just saw you spray-painting
graffiti on that...

09:56.109 --> 09:58.811
on that foreclosed house
across the street.

09:58.878 --> 10:00.813
Mrs. Halstead's place?

10:00.880 --> 10:02.614
That's nuts.

10:04.918 --> 10:06.251
Yeah, I know.

10:06.319 --> 10:07.486
Okay, well, good.

10:07.554 --> 10:08.620
All right, well, come on.

10:08.688 --> 10:09.955
We can stop working now.

10:10.023 --> 10:11.990
We got to figure out what's
going on for dinner.

10:12.058 --> 10:13.559
Really?
Yes, really.

10:13.626 --> 10:15.094
Because whatever it is
you're seeing,

10:15.161 --> 10:16.462
it has no basis in reality.

10:16.529 --> 10:18.113
'Cause the one thing
I can promise you

10:18.198 --> 10:19.932
is that I'm never going
to spray-paint graffiti

10:19.999 --> 10:21.333
on the neighbor's house.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.836
Not at 9:18 in the morning,
not at 9:18 at night.

10:26.973 --> 10:27.973
You're sure?

10:28.041 --> 10:30.576
Yeah, I'm sure.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.420
Sorry for the
hassle, sir.

10:41.488 --> 10:42.955
We got a federal presence
in the building,

10:43.022 --> 10:44.356
and you can't be too
careful these days.

10:44.424 --> 10:45.724

12:22.555 --> 12:25.057
and a representative from
the DA's office ask to see me.

12:25.124 --> 12:27.025
So what can I do
for you, folks?

12:27.093 --> 12:29.027
Now, my colleague and I
are looking for somebody

12:29.095 --> 12:32.030
who we think was involved
in a serious accident.

12:32.098 --> 12:33.665
Now, we have
reason to believe

12:33.733 --> 12:36.168
that he came to this
building to visit you.

12:36.236 --> 12:38.136
Hmm?
We don't have his name,

12:38.204 --> 12:41.206
but we do have a
detailed description.

12:46.512 --> 12:48.614
Oh...

12:48.681 --> 12:50.849
this looks like a fellow
named Gavin Finch.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.251
Gavin Finch?

12:52.318 --> 12:54.720
He-he's a client of yours or...
? No, no,

12:54.787 --> 12:56.054
more like a colleague.

12:56.122 --> 12:57.889
Gavin is a city building
inspector.

12:57.957 --> 13:00.392
My company will get a contract
to build a building,

13:00.460 --> 13:02.394
and Gavin will come by
the construction site

13:02.462 --> 13:04.396
and make sure everything
is up to code.

13:04.464 --> 13:06.665
He's a good guy; very thorough.

13:06.733 --> 13:08.667
What kind of accident
was he in?

13:08.735 --> 13:10.168
Is he okay?

13:10.236 --> 13:12.170
Well, that's what we're
trying to figure out.

13:12.238 --> 13:14.673
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Finch?

13:14.741 --> 13:17.009
Well, actually, the last project
we worked on together

13:17.076 --> 13:19.177
was when my company
put up this building.

13:19.245 --> 13:21.813
Gavin did all the inspection
for 414, Wright

13:21.881 --> 13:23.315
and all the follow-ups as well.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.984
The last one was probably--

13:26.052 --> 13:28.687
I don't know-- week,
week-and-a-half ago.

13:31.257 --> 13:33.158
My secretary has
all his contact information.

13:33.226 --> 13:34.226
You're welcome to it

13:34.294 --> 13:35.627
if you think
that'll help.

13:35.695 --> 13:36.612
Yeah, that'd
be great.

13:36.696 --> 13:37.896
All, well, good.
Swing by

13:37.947 --> 13:39.464
her desk on your way out.

13:39.532 --> 13:41.266
She can also validate
your parking.

13:41.334 --> 13:44.269
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

13:44.337 --> 13:47.372
Oh, actually, I'd love to ask
you a question, Mr. Walcott.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.207
I know this might sound strange,

13:49.275 --> 13:51.710
but can you think of any reason
why Gavin Finch

13:51.778 --> 13:53.679
might want to take a
sledgehammer to this building?

13:53.746 --> 13:55.580
Excuse me?

13:55.648 --> 13:56.882
To the parking garage.

13:56.949 --> 13:59.384
Can you think of why
he would take a sledgehammer

13:59.452 --> 14:01.586
and start banging the wall
of the parking garage?

14:01.654 --> 14:03.588
A sledgehammer?

14:03.656 --> 14:05.624
No, I don't think so.

14:05.692 --> 14:08.093
He did inspections,
not demolition.

14:08.161 --> 14:09.695
Anything else?

14:09.762 --> 14:12.331
No. That's great.
Thanks for your time.

14:12.398 --> 14:13.332
Thank you.

14:13.399 --> 14:14.933
Not a problem.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.492
Oh.

14:23.576 --> 14:24.910
Thanks.

14:33.986 --> 14:35.954
Can you speed it up?

14:36.022 --> 14:37.222
I'm in a hurry here.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.758
You'll be on your way
in a moment, sir.

14:42.195 --> 14:46.031
Hey, I think I see something
under here.

14:51.471 --> 14:53.772
Sir, would you release
the trunk, please?

15:05.852 --> 15:07.786
You can go on
ahead, ma'am.

15:07.854 --> 15:09.654
There's no charge
with validation.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.356
Ma'am?

15:16.723 --> 15:19.919
And you have no idea when this man
intends to blow up 414 Wright?

15:20.019 --> 15:23.986
Well, not the day, only that it
happens at 9:18 in the morning.

15:24.086 --> 15:26.120
Could a car bomb
really cause an explosion

15:26.188 --> 15:27.889
that would be felt
all over the city?

15:27.956 --> 15:32.026
If you pack enough C-4
into the trunk? Maybe.

15:32.094 --> 15:35.196
It's also possible the car
bomb's just the first explosion.

15:35.264 --> 15:37.765
If the garage was lined
with secondary charges,

15:37.833 --> 15:39.901
you'd definitely feel it
everywhere,

15:39.968 --> 15:41.736
especially if
the building came down.

15:41.803 --> 15:44.405
Any sense of what kind of car
this man was driving?

15:44.473 --> 15:46.874
I only saw his face.

15:46.942 --> 15:48.809
All right.

15:48.877 --> 15:50.378
Well, then, let's first
generate a sketch

15:50.445 --> 15:52.647
of the man you saw
driving the car and make sure

15:52.714 --> 15:54.649
that both the police and
the folks in charge of security

15:54.716 --> 15:55.816
at that building have it.

15:55.884 --> 15:58.185
You know,
the Department of Commerce

15:58.253 --> 15:59.387
occupies several
floors over there.

15:59.438 --> 16:01.105
Odds are, they're the target.

16:01.189 --> 16:04.158
I'm going to notify my
colleagues on the federal side

16:04.226 --> 16:06.761
and make them aware that
there is a credible threat

16:06.828 --> 16:08.462
against 414 Wright.

16:10.098 --> 16:12.266
Uh, is there something else?

16:12.334 --> 16:14.569
Well, sir, if it...

16:14.636 --> 16:17.238
if it's all right with you,
I-I'd like to touch you.

16:17.306 --> 16:20.074
I beg your pardon?

16:20.142 --> 16:22.076
I would like to see
where you are at 9:18

16:22.144 --> 16:23.411
when this all happens.

16:23.478 --> 16:25.479
If I could see where you
are, what you're doing

16:25.547 --> 16:26.614
when the bomb goes off,

16:26.682 --> 16:28.916
it might give me another
piece of the puzzle.

16:28.984 --> 16:31.552
Okay, so, how does this work?

16:31.620 --> 16:32.954
Give me your hand.

16:57.512 --> 16:58.946
So?

16:59.014 --> 17:01.582
So you were looking
at a newspaper.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.819
It's going to be a bad
day on Wall Street.

17:22.637 --> 17:24.105
Hey.

17:24.172 --> 17:25.573
That's my blanket, too.

17:25.641 --> 17:27.174
Okay. Sorry.

17:27.242 --> 17:28.776
I can't...
I can't sleep.

17:28.844 --> 17:30.444
I'll go out on the couch.

17:30.512 --> 17:32.713
Hey, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

17:32.781 --> 17:34.482
What's going on?

17:34.549 --> 17:36.484
You still thinking
about that bomb?

17:36.551 --> 17:38.452
Look, look, I know.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.221
You don't think
that you'll ever do graffiti

17:40.288 --> 17:41.722
on that house across the street.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.058
You think that
this is all crazy?

17:44.126 --> 17:45.926
But you're not inside my head.

17:45.994 --> 17:48.029
You didn't see that bomb go off.

17:48.096 --> 17:50.331
Okay, Al. Come on.

17:50.399 --> 17:54.335
Hey, what if 414 Wright Street
isn't the only target?

17:54.403 --> 17:56.737
What if there's bombs
all over the city?

17:56.805 --> 17:59.173
What if it's a dirty bomb?

17:59.241 --> 18:00.574
Look, I'm really
starting to think

18:00.642 --> 18:02.209
maybe we should just
pack the girls up

18:02.277 --> 18:04.111
and take them to go visit Ariel
at school.

18:04.179 --> 18:06.213
Wait, Allison. You're
not making any sense.

18:06.281 --> 18:09.016
We still don't know what day
this bomb is going to go off

18:09.084 --> 18:10.551
or even if it's
going to go off.

18:10.619 --> 18:12.620
And leaving our
jobs aside,

18:12.688 --> 18:14.522
do you really think
Ariel's gonna welcome

18:14.589 --> 18:17.858
an open-ended stay from her
mom, dad and two sisters?

18:17.926 --> 18:20.227
Well, we can go someplace else.

18:20.295 --> 18:21.462
How about this?

18:21.530 --> 18:23.464
The minute that I start thinking

18:23.532 --> 18:26.133
about vandalizing that house,
I'll call you.

18:26.201 --> 18:28.669
We'll get of the first plane
out of town.

18:31.740 --> 18:32.840
You promise?

18:32.908 --> 18:34.709
Scout's honor.

18:34.776 --> 18:36.777
Now, what do you say
we get a little sleep?

18:36.845 --> 18:38.879
Come on.
I promise.

18:38.947 --> 18:40.414
Come on.

18:42.984 --> 18:45.586
There you go. You
take all the covers.

18:47.989 --> 18:50.224
Okay.

18:50.292 --> 18:51.892
Ah.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.028
Okay.

18:55.597 --> 18:57.098
Did you hear that?

18:57.165 --> 18:59.867
That sounded like
the front door.

19:00.902 --> 19:02.336
Somebody unlocked it.

19:04.773 --> 19:06.707
Hey. Is that Marie?

19:09.611 --> 19:10.911
What?

19:10.979 --> 19:12.980
Hey!

19:14.116 --> 19:15.216
Hey, Marie.

19:15.283 --> 19:17.184
Hey! Hey!

19:17.252 --> 19:19.420
Marie, put
that can down.

19:19.471 --> 19:21.455
What
are you doing?

19:21.523 --> 19:23.808
Hey! Didn't
you hear me?

19:23.892 --> 19:25.893
Put that can down.

19:26.961 --> 19:29.964
Hey.

19:30.031 --> 19:32.099
Mommy? Daddy?

19:32.167 --> 19:34.068
What are we doing out here?

19:34.136 --> 19:36.136
You don't remember?

19:45.747 --> 19:47.414
Okay.

19:47.482 --> 19:48.833
I finally got her
back to sleep.

19:48.917 --> 19:50.184
I put her in our bed.

19:50.252 --> 19:51.552
Hope that's okay.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.787
Yeah, that's fine.

19:52.854 --> 19:54.188
I mean, I just
don't get it.

19:54.256 --> 19:57.825
Is it even possible that
Marie could get spray paint

19:57.893 --> 19:59.994
out of our garage
and vandalize a house,

20:00.061 --> 20:01.962
all the while
being fast asleep?

20:02.030 --> 20:03.330
I don't know.

20:03.398 --> 20:06.367
This article says sleepwalkers
do some pretty wild stuff.

20:06.434 --> 20:08.135
But how do we
make it stop?

20:08.203 --> 20:10.171
It says kids usually
grow out of it.

20:10.238 --> 20:12.039
I'm just not sure
we can wait for that.

20:12.107 --> 20:13.674
There are some medications.

20:13.742 --> 20:15.810
This guy put an alarm
on his kids' doors.

20:15.877 --> 20:16.811
Aah...

20:16.878 --> 20:19.013
I don't have
an answer, Allison.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.347
I guess I'll start

20:20.448 --> 20:22.516
by painting over Marie's
masterpiece tomorrow.

20:22.584 --> 20:24.185
Hey.

20:24.252 --> 20:26.787
Paint. Not spray.

20:26.855 --> 20:27.955
I'll use a brush.

20:27.989 --> 20:29.390
I'll make sure not to do it

20:29.457 --> 20:30.925
anywhere near 9:18
in the morning.

20:30.992 --> 20:32.927
Thank you.

20:32.994 --> 20:36.263
Now let's join
our little Picasso in bed,

20:36.331 --> 20:38.199
before she makes a break for it

20:38.266 --> 20:39.834
and starts
to decorate our house.

21:21.259 --> 21:23.194
<i>Not bad.</i>

21:23.261 --> 21:24.862
If we keep going like this,

21:24.930 --> 21:27.198
in three weeks, we
should have all of him.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.533
Just kidding.

21:29.601 --> 21:32.236
The rest of him's probably
already in a landfill somewhere.

21:32.304 --> 21:33.737
We only beat the
trash pickup

21:33.805 --> 21:35.806
outside that bar you dreamed
about by maybe an hour.

21:35.874 --> 21:37.141
Well, I just don't get it.

21:37.209 --> 21:38.776
Why chop him into pieces

21:38.843 --> 21:40.744
and throw him in a bunch
of different Dumpsters?

21:40.812 --> 21:42.646
It's actually
pretty common.

21:42.714 --> 21:44.815
A bunch of small packages
are a lot less likely

21:44.883 --> 21:46.850
to be noticed
than one really big one.

21:46.918 --> 21:49.053
We see it with organized crime
murders all the time.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.488
Yeah, but Gavin Finch
is a building inspector.

21:51.556 --> 21:53.757
You really think he was mixing
with career criminals?

21:53.825 --> 21:55.693
I don't know, maybe he
had a gambling problem.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.027
Maybe the guy
who killed him

21:57.095 --> 21:59.230
just watched a lot
of mob movies.

21:59.297 --> 22:01.732
At least we know for sure we're
dealing with a homicide now,

22:01.800 --> 22:03.467
thanks to your heads up.

22:09.207 --> 22:11.041
Damn it.

22:11.109 --> 22:12.509
New mug. Lynn
gave it to me

22:12.577 --> 22:14.345
a few days ago. I
can't get this lid

22:14.412 --> 22:16.614
screwed on right.

22:23.755 --> 22:26.290
Oh, my God, Lee.

22:26.358 --> 22:27.791
It's today.
It's happening today.

22:27.859 --> 22:29.960
Excuse me?

22:30.028 --> 22:31.528
When I touched your hand
the other day,

22:31.596 --> 22:33.063
you were trying to get
that coffee stain

22:33.131 --> 22:36.166
out of your shirt
when the bomb went off.

22:37.936 --> 22:39.203
It's happening now.

22:39.271 --> 22:41.438
We have less than 20 minutes.

22:41.506 --> 22:43.907
<i>We're coming to you live</i>
<i>from the 400 block</i>

22:43.975 --> 22:45.609
<i>of Wright Street,</i>
<i>where police have pulled</i>

22:45.677 --> 22:48.996
<i>a car over in an apparent</i>
<i>response to a bomb threat.</i>

22:49.064 --> 22:52.399
<i>We have no word yet as to the</i>
<i>identity of the car's driver,</i>

22:52.467 --> 22:54.702
<i>but as you can see,</i>
<i>the authorities seem to be</i>

22:54.769 --> 22:57.304
<i>taking this threat</i>
<i>very seriously.</i>

22:57.372 --> 22:59.840
<i>Additionally, we've been told</i>
<i>they're in the process</i>

22:59.891 --> 23:03.110
<i>of evacuating all the buildings</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

23:03.178 --> 23:04.845
According to the bomb squad,
this gentleman matched

23:04.913 --> 23:06.513
your drawing perfectly,
and he was about

23:06.581 --> 23:08.182
to pull into
the garage at 9:14.

23:08.249 --> 23:09.650
They know to look
in the trunk?

23:09.718 --> 23:11.251
They know to look
in the trunk.

23:11.319 --> 23:14.655
<i>It appears that the bomb squad</i>
<i>is approaching the vehicle.</i>

23:14.723 --> 23:16.357
<i>The, uh, buildings</i>
<i>around us are still</i>

23:16.424 --> 23:17.925
<i>being evacuated,</i>
<i>so they must believe</i>

23:17.993 --> 23:20.527
<i>there's an imminent threat</i>
<i>of explosion here.</i>

23:47.956 --> 23:49.990
<i>I don't have verification</i>
<i>for you yet,</i>

23:50.058 --> 23:52.593
<i>but it would appear that the</i>
<i>bomb squad officer on the scene</i>

23:52.660 --> 23:53.694
<i>is giving the all clear.</i>

23:53.762 --> 23:55.529
What?

23:55.597 --> 23:57.664
<i>The police have just removed</i>

23:57.732 --> 24:00.300
<i>what appears to be</i>
<i>a child's toy</i>

24:00.368 --> 24:01.702
<i>from the trunk of the vehicle.</i>

24:01.770 --> 24:04.738
<i>And we do now have a</i>
<i>confirmation on that all clear.</i>

24:04.806 --> 24:07.041
<i>So it seems</i>
<i>either they got the wrong man</i>

24:07.108 --> 24:08.575
<i>or the wrong car</i>

24:08.643 --> 24:10.210
<i>or maybe, just maybe,</i>

24:10.278 --> 24:12.312
<i>this whole thing</i>
<i>has been one big hoax.</i>

24:12.380 --> 24:13.480
I don't understand.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.549
It was supposed to be
this morning.

24:19.059 --> 24:21.879
It looked like the guy
that I had them pull over,

24:21.979 --> 24:23.213
the police pull over?

24:23.281 --> 24:24.247
He's not a terrorist,

24:24.315 --> 24:25.815
he's an accountant.

24:25.883 --> 24:28.184
He works for
Walcott Construction.

24:28.252 --> 24:31.288
He picks up all the paperwork
from their building sites

24:31.355 --> 24:33.223
and brings them back to
the main office every morning.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.625
And you want to know what was
in the trunk of his car?

24:35.693 --> 24:37.694
It was a toy.

24:37.762 --> 24:40.230
It was a birthday present
that he'd bought for his niece.

24:40.298 --> 24:41.931
Well, so you made a mistake.

24:41.999 --> 24:44.367
A mistake that, I grant you,
cost a lot of people

24:44.435 --> 24:46.002
a significant portion
of their day.

24:46.070 --> 24:47.804
But what else
were you supposed to do?

24:47.872 --> 24:49.739
You thought a bomb
was going to go off.

24:49.807 --> 24:51.908
You missed a spot
on your elbow.

24:51.975 --> 24:55.545
You know, I spent two hours
painting over all that graffiti.

24:55.613 --> 24:58.948
That guy Russ
stopped to thank me for being

24:59.016 --> 25:00.450
such a good neighbor.

25:00.518 --> 25:02.151
I didn't have the heart
to tell him

25:02.203 --> 25:03.837
I was cleaning up
after my own kid.

25:03.921 --> 25:05.422
Mommy, Daddy.

25:05.489 --> 25:08.958
Is it okay if Lemon
goes to bed with us tonight?

25:09.026 --> 25:10.694
Well, sure, baby,
that's okay.

25:10.761 --> 25:11.928
Let's ask Daddy.

25:11.996 --> 25:14.464
Yep. Lemon's bed is our bed.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.566
Just no field trips
out in the street

25:16.634 --> 25:19.602
in the middle
of the night, okay?

25:19.670 --> 25:22.806
♪ ♪

25:56.974 --> 25:59.409
Morning, Bridge.

25:59.477 --> 26:01.077
Mommy still asleep?

26:01.145 --> 26:02.846
No, she had to go
into work early,

26:02.913 --> 26:05.382
so I'm taking you guys
to school today.

26:05.449 --> 26:07.117
Did Marie
sleepwalk again?

26:07.184 --> 26:08.885
No, she slept like a baby.

26:08.936 --> 26:11.254
She's still sleeping
like a baby, actually.

26:11.322 --> 26:13.406
What's this on your hands?

26:13.491 --> 26:15.425
Wow.

26:15.493 --> 26:17.694
That wasn't there
when I went to bed last night.

26:17.762 --> 26:19.462
It's all over you.

26:19.530 --> 26:22.499
You're covered in paint.

26:22.566 --> 26:24.634
I didn't do that.

26:24.702 --> 26:28.138
Bridge, look
at yourself.

26:28.205 --> 26:29.756
You're covered
in red paint.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.425
The house is covered
in red paint.

26:32.510 --> 26:35.779
Well, if I did do it,
I didn't realize I was doing it.

26:35.846 --> 26:38.014
So I can't get
in trouble. Right?

26:41.218 --> 26:42.685
What if I caught
what Marie has?

26:42.753 --> 26:44.287
It's not a virus.

26:44.355 --> 26:46.656
You can't catch the
sleepwalking bug.

26:46.724 --> 26:47.857
Are you sure about that?

26:47.925 --> 26:50.660
I mean, look at me.

26:50.728 --> 26:53.797
How am I supposed to get this
stuff off before school starts?

26:53.864 --> 26:55.782
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:55.866 --> 26:57.967
You want to know where <i>I</i> was

26:58.035 --> 26:59.636
the night
that Gavin Finch disappeared?

26:59.703 --> 27:01.371
We're just following up
on a tip, Mr. Walcott.

27:01.439 --> 27:04.207
The sooner we can rule you out,
the sooner we can be on our way.

27:04.275 --> 27:05.575
A tip?

27:05.643 --> 27:08.077
Did the person who gave you
this tip happen to mention

27:08.145 --> 27:10.680
why I might want
to murder a man I barely knew?

27:12.550 --> 27:14.284
All right.

27:14.351 --> 27:15.652
Oh, fine, fine, fine.

27:15.719 --> 27:17.670
What night did you say
he disappeared?

27:17.755 --> 27:20.690
No one's seen him or heard
from him since last Wednesday.

27:20.758 --> 27:21.991
All right.

27:22.059 --> 27:24.060
This is crazy.

27:27.665 --> 27:29.566
Oh, I didn't have
any appointments that night.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.067
I must have been at home.

27:31.135 --> 27:32.569
Can anybody confirm that?

27:32.636 --> 27:34.637
No. I live alone.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.374
Look...

27:38.442 --> 27:40.743
I know
you people have a job to do,

27:40.811 --> 27:43.112
and I will cooperate
however you want me to.

27:43.180 --> 27:45.815
You want to search my house,
my office, my car.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.684
Whatever moves us past this.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.452
I believe we'll
take you up on that.

27:49.503 --> 27:51.287
Good. Fine. Have at it.

27:53.858 --> 27:55.492
Oh. We just got
the reports back

27:55.559 --> 27:57.460
from the east side construction
sites, Mr. Walcott,

27:57.528 --> 28:00.096
and everyone's waiting for you
in the staff meeting.

28:00.164 --> 28:01.831
All right.
You don't need me here

28:01.882 --> 28:03.766
while you dig
through my stuff, do you?

28:03.834 --> 28:05.668
No. All right, I'll
be down the hall.

28:05.719 --> 28:07.437
These people are going
to be working

28:07.504 --> 28:09.189
in my office
for a little while.

28:09.273 --> 28:10.473
Oh.
Oh, for God's sake.

28:10.524 --> 28:11.691
I'm so sorry, sir.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.776
Here, let me
give you a hand.

28:30.194 --> 28:32.228
What was that?

28:36.634 --> 28:38.735
Oh, my God,
it's still gonna happen.

28:38.802 --> 28:39.919
What's still gonna happen?

28:40.004 --> 28:41.370
What are you...
What are you talking about?

29:17.841 --> 29:19.642
What are you doing?

29:19.710 --> 29:21.711
What the hell's
the matter with you?

29:32.423 --> 29:34.958
You're counting the
minutes, aren't you?

29:35.025 --> 29:37.160
The seconds.

29:37.227 --> 29:38.595
Go to sleep, honey.

29:38.662 --> 29:40.530
I'm not stopping you
from sleeping.

29:40.598 --> 29:44.133
You realize this is
absurd behavior, right?

29:44.201 --> 29:45.702
Spending every moment of the day

29:45.769 --> 29:47.537
and now every moment
of the night,

29:47.605 --> 29:49.305
waiting for 9:18
in the morning,

29:49.373 --> 29:51.541
to see if it's going
to be <i>the</i> morning?

29:51.609 --> 29:53.643
You want to know
what's absurd behavior?

29:53.711 --> 29:56.980
Is letting people go in and out
of that building all day.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.881
Letting people go
to work there,

29:58.949 --> 30:00.683
when I know someone's planning

30:00.751 --> 30:02.852
on blowing that place
to smithereens.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.087
Now, that is absurd.

30:04.154 --> 30:06.022
And don't lecture
to me about absurd.

30:06.090 --> 30:08.891
I have that channel playing
in my head all the time.

30:08.959 --> 30:10.560
Allison, you've done
everything that you can.

30:10.628 --> 30:12.228
You've told your
boss what you saw.

30:12.296 --> 30:13.730
They're beefing up
security at the building.

30:13.797 --> 30:15.698
I mean, what do you
want them to do?

30:15.766 --> 30:19.002
Shut it down, forbid anyone
from being anywhere near there.

30:19.069 --> 30:20.336
They're not
gonna do that.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.038
So what do you want to do?

30:22.106 --> 30:23.373
Just not sleep?

30:23.440 --> 30:24.540
Oh, that'll show them.

30:24.608 --> 30:25.942
Shh. It's okay.

30:26.010 --> 30:28.745
What do you want to
do about these two?

30:28.812 --> 30:30.513
I think it's pretty
obvious we're not dealing

30:30.581 --> 30:31.748
with garden variety
sleepwalking here.

30:31.815 --> 30:33.783
I mean, what? Are we
gonna share our bed

30:33.851 --> 30:35.518
with them for the
rest of our lives?

30:35.586 --> 30:38.321
I don't know, Joe. How do you
want to deal with them?

30:38.389 --> 30:40.957
For that matter,
how do you want to deal with me?

30:45.429 --> 30:47.430
Same to you.

30:50.034 --> 30:53.036
Look at these,
Mr. Walcott.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.538
Take a good,
long look.

30:55.606 --> 30:56.706
You like that one?

30:56.774 --> 30:58.274
I think that
one's my favorite.

30:58.342 --> 31:00.209
Yesterday, I came by
with a sledgehammer.

31:00.277 --> 31:02.812
That's what I found
inside the wall.

31:02.880 --> 31:06.549
That's what's supporting
this building. Nothing.

31:06.617 --> 31:08.484
I don't know how I let
you talk me into this.

31:08.552 --> 31:10.086
I don't know why I
ever listened to you.

31:10.154 --> 31:11.788
You listened to me, Gavin,
'cause you wanted

31:11.855 --> 31:13.289
to make money, just like I did.

31:13.357 --> 31:14.490
No! You lied to me.

31:14.558 --> 31:16.826
You said you wanted
to cut a few corners.

31:16.894 --> 31:18.661
This isn't cutting corners.
This is suicide.

31:18.729 --> 31:20.830
Gavin...
You subbed 2000 p.s.i. concrete

31:20.898 --> 31:22.331
for the 4000 that was required.

31:22.399 --> 31:24.634
You spaced the reinforced bars
24 inches apart

31:24.702 --> 31:26.302
when the plans clearly called
for 12.

31:26.370 --> 31:28.171
You used the cheapest steel
you could find...

31:28.238 --> 31:29.338
You think I'm stupid?

31:29.406 --> 31:30.606
You think I'd put my own offices

31:30.674 --> 31:32.275
in a building
if I didn't think it was safe?

31:32.342 --> 31:35.244
It doesn't matter
if you think it's safe!

31:35.312 --> 31:37.246
You're an arrogant man,
Mr. Walcott,

31:37.314 --> 31:38.981
and I think you thought you
could build your building

31:39.049 --> 31:40.349
any way you'd like,
and you know what?

31:40.417 --> 31:43.219
In a city like Chicago
or New York or Boston,

31:43.287 --> 31:44.754
you'd probably be right.

31:44.822 --> 31:46.289
But this is Phoenix.

31:46.356 --> 31:49.292
There are active fault lines
all over the state.

31:49.359 --> 31:50.960
So you're sure
that this building

31:51.028 --> 31:52.595
wouldn't make it in a quake?

31:52.663 --> 31:53.763
You're positive?

31:53.831 --> 31:57.467
The last time I was here

31:57.534 --> 31:59.535
was after that quake in Sedona.

32:00.971 --> 32:05.141
I saw hairline cracks
forming in the parking garage.

32:05.209 --> 32:08.411
Now, given all the seismic
activity in this area,

32:08.479 --> 32:11.547
it's not a matter of
<i>if</i> this building comes down.

32:11.615 --> 32:13.549
It's a matter of when.

32:21.825 --> 32:23.993
Look, Mr. Walcott, we
have to come forward.

32:24.061 --> 32:26.362
We have to tell the
authorities what we've done

32:26.430 --> 32:27.797
before we cause
the deaths

32:27.865 --> 32:29.632
of everyone who works
in this building.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.634
I don't know.

32:31.702 --> 32:32.935
Maybe if we're lucky,

32:33.003 --> 32:35.571
maybe if we tell them everything
we know, the-the...

32:35.639 --> 32:37.874
we won't get jail time.

32:39.243 --> 32:41.911
Well, coming forward
<i>is</i> one option.

32:44.314 --> 32:47.316
But it's not the only one.

32:49.119 --> 32:51.020
You know, the federal government

32:51.088 --> 32:53.356
has office space
in this building?

32:53.423 --> 32:57.426
The Commerce Department leases
the entire fifth floor.

32:59.229 --> 33:00.696
Okay, so?

33:00.764 --> 33:02.098
So...

33:02.166 --> 33:04.600
Well, I don't know
if you're keeping up on

33:04.651 --> 33:06.402
your current events, Gavin,
but there's a lot

33:06.469 --> 33:08.470
of people out there
who are not too pleased

33:08.522 --> 33:11.974
with the federal
government these days.

33:15.162 --> 33:19.448
Now, what if some madman
got ahold of some explosive,

33:19.516 --> 33:21.450
put it into
the trunk of a car

33:21.518 --> 33:22.752
and set it off

33:22.820 --> 33:25.655
in our parking garage?

33:25.722 --> 33:27.156
Huh?

33:27.224 --> 33:30.760
What if somebody like <i>that</i>
destroyed our building...

33:30.828 --> 33:33.396
and not some earthquake?

33:33.463 --> 33:37.200
I don't know how anybody
could blame us for that, do you?

33:37.267 --> 33:39.268
I'm a contractor, Gavin.

33:39.336 --> 33:41.170
I have access
to all kinds of explosives.

33:41.238 --> 33:43.306
It would only take me
a couple of days

33:43.373 --> 33:44.740
to get us whatever we needed.

33:44.808 --> 33:47.210
What do you mean "us"?

33:47.277 --> 33:48.611
Well, you helped make this mess;

33:48.679 --> 33:51.547
I think it's only fair
that you help clean it up.

33:51.615 --> 33:55.484
Look, all we need to do is stuff
a bunch of C-4 into a car,

33:55.552 --> 33:58.154
park it downstairs
and detonate it by cell phone.

33:58.222 --> 33:59.889
Problem solved, right?

33:59.957 --> 34:01.924
I think I made a mistake.

34:01.992 --> 34:03.626
I...

34:03.694 --> 34:06.062
I don't think
I should've come here.

34:28.580 --> 34:30.737
Joseph Dubois!
Is that you?

34:30.791 --> 34:32.893
Oh, hi, Mrs. Halstead!

34:32.960 --> 34:34.594
Hello.
Mmm.

34:34.646 --> 34:35.929
Hi.
Ooh.

34:35.980 --> 34:38.630
Yeah, we've been having
a graffiti problem

34:38.683 --> 34:41.001
Mm-hmm.
since you left, and...

34:41.069 --> 34:44.004
I don't know, I just got
tired of looking at it.

34:44.072 --> 34:45.405
Well, that's
very nice of you.

34:45.473 --> 34:47.940
I'm sure my friends at the
bank will be very grateful.

34:48.009 --> 34:49.643
Yeah, Allison and I
were so sorry

34:49.710 --> 34:51.061
Oh...
to hear about what happened.

34:51.129 --> 34:54.014
Oh, well, it's happening
to a lot of people.

34:54.081 --> 34:56.116
My husband,
when he refinanced,

34:56.184 --> 35:00.354
he didn't expect the rates
to go up as much as they did.

35:00.421 --> 35:02.622
He also didn't
expect to die.

35:02.690 --> 35:04.708
Well, I was just coming

35:04.792 --> 35:07.260
to pick up a few things
out back in the shed.

35:07.328 --> 35:10.180
Do you want me to come back later?
No, no, that's all right.

35:10.264 --> 35:13.000
I can see how hard
you're working.

35:13.067 --> 35:16.036
Well... I almost wish
that you hadn't done it.

35:16.104 --> 35:18.271
The bank has already
had to postpone

35:18.339 --> 35:20.057
two walk-throughs
because of this mess,

35:20.141 --> 35:23.894
and if I could get them
to delay just a few more days,

35:23.978 --> 35:26.730
I'd be able to buy
the place back myself.

35:26.814 --> 35:28.198
You're kidding.

35:28.282 --> 35:29.649
No.

35:29.701 --> 35:34.121
So all this... this graffiti's
not necessarily a bad thing?

35:34.188 --> 35:35.922
Well, I don't think
that the vandals

35:35.990 --> 35:37.524
put it there to help me.

35:37.592 --> 35:39.826
But like I said, two more days,

35:39.894 --> 35:42.062
I could buy the place back.

35:57.078 --> 35:58.945
And you're telling us
that Rob Walcott,

35:59.013 --> 36:00.713
the same man who
built 414 Wright

36:00.765 --> 36:02.215
is gonna blow up 414 Wright?

36:02.283 --> 36:05.185
Kill hundreds of people just to
cover up a few code violations?

36:05.253 --> 36:07.487
It's not just a few
code violations.

36:07.555 --> 36:09.556
Finch said that the
building was unstable.

36:09.624 --> 36:12.159
He said even a small quake
could bring it down.

36:12.226 --> 36:14.528
Look, when I touched
Walcott the other day,

36:14.595 --> 36:16.496
I saw him sitting in
this outdoor cafe,

36:16.564 --> 36:18.231
like, a block from
his building.

36:18.299 --> 36:21.501
It was 9:18, and he was punching
these numbers into his cell phone,

36:21.569 --> 36:24.304
and I thought at the time
he was just making a call,

36:24.372 --> 36:26.673
but now I think he was
actually triggering a bomb.

36:26.741 --> 36:28.542
The same bomb
that we didn't find

36:28.609 --> 36:30.844
in the trunk of that
car the other day?

36:30.912 --> 36:32.779
Okay, let's say you're right,
let's say Walcott

36:32.847 --> 36:34.748
was planning on blowing up
his own building.

36:34.816 --> 36:36.683
Do you think he'd
go through with it

36:36.751 --> 36:38.652
after everything that happened?

36:38.719 --> 36:41.354
Well, he has to;
he has no choice.

36:41.422 --> 36:43.824
He knows that if we figure
out what he's doing,

36:43.891 --> 36:45.792
he's going to jail.
So in other words,

36:45.860 --> 36:47.260
we're right back
where we started--

36:47.328 --> 36:49.696
we know that someone's planning
on taking hundreds of lives

36:49.764 --> 36:52.132
at 414 Wright, we
just don't know when.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.867
But it doesn't matter when,
not anymore.

36:53.935 --> 36:56.870
All we have to do is prove
414 Wright is unsafe.

36:56.938 --> 37:00.440
After that, Walcott will have
no reason to destroy it.

37:01.943 --> 37:03.643
I'll call the City
Inspector's Office

37:03.711 --> 37:05.778
and request an emergency
inspection right away.

37:05.830 --> 37:08.281
Manny, maybe hold on a second.

37:08.332 --> 37:10.050
When you touched him
the other day,

37:10.118 --> 37:13.587
you said that you saw what I was
doing when the bomb went off.

37:13.654 --> 37:15.856
I had a coffee stain
on my shirt, right?

37:15.923 --> 37:17.624
Well, there's something wrong
with the lid

37:17.692 --> 37:19.392
on that mug that Lynn gave me.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.262
I spilled my coffee again...
right before

37:22.330 --> 37:24.681
I got here.

37:25.733 --> 37:27.868
Allison?

37:35.943 --> 37:38.912
It's today, sir--
he's gonna blow it up today.

38:35.403 --> 38:37.304
555-0132--

38:37.371 --> 38:39.839
that's your number,
isn't it, Mr. Walcott?

38:39.891 --> 38:41.841
I beg your pardon?

38:41.893 --> 38:43.894
That's the number
that keeps popping up

38:43.978 --> 38:46.179
on this phone's caller I.D.--
it's yours.

38:46.230 --> 38:48.732
Do you believe that
less than 30 minutes ago,

38:48.816 --> 38:50.433
this phone was connected
to a powerful bomb

38:50.518 --> 38:52.852
in the trunk of that car
you just watched drive by?

38:52.904 --> 38:54.354
What car? What bomb?

38:54.422 --> 38:56.022
What are... what are
you talking about?

38:56.090 --> 38:57.624
I'm talking about
that sedan,

38:57.692 --> 38:59.559
the one that's driven
by your accountant,

38:59.627 --> 39:01.895
the one who works
in your office.

39:01.963 --> 39:04.531
You heard about his little
adventure, didn't you?

39:04.582 --> 39:07.000
Come on, how could
you not have?

39:07.068 --> 39:08.501
The bomb squad pulled him over,

39:08.569 --> 39:10.337
told him
they had reason to believe

39:10.404 --> 39:12.172
that his trunk was full of C-4.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.307
So, two days ago,
they pulled him over.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.843
They opened his trunk--
it's empty.

39:16.910 --> 39:19.613
This morning they looked again,
and it's not.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.548
I got to say,
Mr. Walcott,

39:21.599 --> 39:23.800
it's pretty bold of you
to plant the bomb there anyway.

39:23.884 --> 39:25.885
But seeing as your accountant's
car is a company car,

39:25.953 --> 39:27.654
I'm guessing it's
one of the only ones

39:27.722 --> 39:29.389
that you had access to.

39:29.457 --> 39:31.157
I guess you got a set of keys

39:31.225 --> 39:34.094
for it and everything.
This is some kind of joke, right?

39:34.161 --> 39:35.762
I mean, you don't
seriously believe

39:35.830 --> 39:38.231
I'd try to blow up
my own building, do you?

39:38.299 --> 39:40.166
I built 414 Wright.

39:40.234 --> 39:42.869
I have offices in there,
people I care about.

39:42.937 --> 39:44.204
Like Gavin Finch?

39:45.873 --> 39:48.174
We know you murdered him;
we just can't prove it.

39:48.242 --> 39:50.777
The good news is, I don't
think we're gonna have to.

39:50.845 --> 39:54.080
Once we pull your cell phone records,
and we connect you to this phone,

39:54.181 --> 39:58.151
I think you'll be going to prison
for the rest of your life anyway.

40:11.265 --> 40:14.968
Hey, does that say "J hearts A"?

40:16.671 --> 40:18.805
Is that what that says?

40:18.873 --> 40:20.573
Huh.

40:20.641 --> 40:23.843
I have no idea who
would've done that.

40:23.911 --> 40:25.145
You liar.

40:25.212 --> 40:27.213
Give me a kiss.
What if I don't?

40:27.281 --> 40:30.750
Well, then I might call
the cops, you little vandal.

40:30.818 --> 40:33.253
I hate this. I hate
the way you use me.

40:33.354 --> 40:34.788
Oh, shut up and kiss.

40:34.855 --> 40:36.256
♪ ♪

40:36.324 --> 40:37.824
Mmm.

40:37.892 --> 40:39.125
Mmm. That was pretty good.

40:39.193 --> 40:40.894
I think you're
safe for now.

40:40.961 --> 40:43.296
Well, thank goodness, 'cause I'm
all out of clean underwear,

40:43.364 --> 40:46.599
and I hate the idea of going to
the Big House with dirty shorts.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.802
I hate what
it says about you.

40:48.869 --> 40:50.970
You are ever so
romantic, Joe Dubois.
