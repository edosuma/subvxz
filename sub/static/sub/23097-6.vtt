01:11.471 --> 01:14.706
I know, buddy.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.442
I miss him too.

01:21.281 --> 01:25.184
I think mine went
straight through.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.453
- Mine didn't.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.422
Another fine mess
you got us into.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.291
I told you she wasn't
no good.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.159
- I'll make it up to you.

01:34.161 --> 01:37.696
- Please, next life?

01:37.698 --> 01:40.132
- When we get out of this.

01:40.134 --> 01:43.502
- We ain't getting out
of here, hap.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.337
Not alive.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.274
- Where the hell is he?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.742
- I don't know.

01:50.744 --> 01:55.447
Out there somewhere waiting
to shoot our asses off.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.216
- You got any guns here?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.350
- They're all in the back
of the car

01:58.352 --> 01:59.718
At the hippie compound.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.221
- What, all of them?

02:02.223 --> 02:03.355
- What, now you like guns?

02:05.659 --> 02:06.658
My dogs!

02:09.630 --> 02:12.531
<i>- Leonard, I taught your dogs
to lay down!</i>

02:12.533 --> 02:14.333
<i>It's a great trick.</i>

02:14.335 --> 02:17.603
<i>All you got to do is shoot them
through the head.</i>

02:17.605 --> 02:20.339
I'm sorry.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.708
I'm sorry, leonard,
I--

02:29.282 --> 02:31.717
- I didn't think this was
gonna happen.

02:31.719 --> 02:35.387
<i>- Hap and leonard,</i>

02:35.389 --> 02:37.789
<i>Come out and play!</i>

03:12.892 --> 03:15.661
- Here, buddy, you hungry?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.262
There you go.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.695
Can I help you?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.030
- Jeez, sorry, sir.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.931
I was told no one
lived here anymore.

04:59.933 --> 05:04.303
- You got about ten seconds
to get off of this property

05:04.305 --> 05:06.038
Or I'm gonna introduce you
to a dog

05:06.040 --> 05:08.874
That eats ass faster
than salted peanuts.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.676
- They're just signs.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.511
Don't you think you're being
a little over-dramatic?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.913
- Ten, nine...

05:14.915 --> 05:16.448
- Okay, I'm leaving.

05:17.851 --> 05:22.421
Eight, seven, six,

05:22.423 --> 05:25.490
Five, four,

05:25.492 --> 05:29.027
Three, two...

06:04.964 --> 06:08.900
<i>- Looks like she did it
to you again, happy?</i>

06:08.902 --> 06:12.504
She left you with nothing
but the tail lights, baby!

06:12.506 --> 06:15.874
- She gon' come back,
bring the cops with her.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.542
<i>I should get out
if I were you.</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:19.411
- No, no, no, no.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.513
She's already down
in el paso, man,

06:21.515 --> 06:22.948
<i>Drinking tequila,</i>

06:22.950 --> 06:25.650
<i>Rubbing herself
on some cowboy's leg.</i>

06:27.755 --> 06:29.421
- We got guns in here!

06:29.423 --> 06:31.089
<i>- I think the only thing
you got, lenny,</i>

06:31.091 --> 06:34.159
Is two bullets in your ass,

06:34.161 --> 06:38.497
Plus the one in hap's ass
so far.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.832
<i>She is just a bunny rabbit,
you guys?</i>

06:43.604 --> 06:46.104
You two know anything
about eskimos?

06:47.775 --> 06:51.777
- I read a book about 'em once.

06:51.779 --> 06:55.414
Did you know they share women?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.149
Like, I'm hunting here.

06:57.151 --> 07:00.118
You're hunting there.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.789
I'm far from my home,
but I am near yours.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.624
And you are near mine.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.592
- You gonna kill us
or bore us to death?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.896
<i>- So these seal clubbers,</i>

07:10.898 --> 07:14.800
<i>They share women
in igloos and shit,</i>

07:14.802 --> 07:18.804
And they just bang
each other's wives silly,

07:18.806 --> 07:22.674
And they are cool with it, man.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.543
<i>But here's the funny part.</i>

07:24.545 --> 07:26.711
<i>When the men get back,
they just check</i>

07:26.713 --> 07:28.747
<i>The old lady's teeth.</i>

07:28.749 --> 07:30.982
<i>And if she's been chewing
on the other guy's moccasin</i>

07:30.984 --> 07:33.752
To soften the leather,
all hell breaks loose, man.

07:33.754 --> 07:38.056
There have been murders
over that shit.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.625
<i>Which sounds strange
to us, right?</i>

07:40.627 --> 07:43.161
Because all our grief,
it's always over

07:43.163 --> 07:44.696
My pussy, your pussy.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.096
It's my pussy.
It's his pussy.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.504
But if you think about it,
you can wear teeth out.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.974
You cannot wear out
a pussy, guys.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.843
<i>Isn't that something?</i>

08:01.614 --> 08:04.082
Now, baby!

08:09.857 --> 08:12.591
- Come on, bitch!

09:00.273 --> 09:02.040
- Guns?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.943
Who needs guns?

09:04.945 --> 09:09.814
God damn!

09:09.816 --> 09:11.316
Come on!

09:55.995 --> 09:58.897
- Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.702
Catch a nigger by the toe.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.813
- Trudy!

10:22.855 --> 10:25.790
I got him, didn't I?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.292
- You came back.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.132
- Hap...
- Trudy.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.667
- I think I'm shot.

11:05.264 --> 11:09.868
I got to admit
I did not see that coming.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.909
That's right.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.344
You can do it.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.817
Come on, happy, just...

11:25.819 --> 11:26.818
Ease back on the trigger,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.319
Send me up to my baby.

11:46.773 --> 11:50.709
Should've known you wouldn't
be able to do it.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.477
Happy.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.440
- Come on, buddy.

12:44.797 --> 12:48.266
You got him?

12:48.268 --> 12:52.804
Come on.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.206
That's it.
That's it.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.808
In you go.

13:03.182 --> 13:06.985
- Room for one more?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.319
- Good boy, switch.

13:16.962 --> 13:20.532
- Hap?
- Yeah?

13:20.534 --> 13:24.135
- We gonna make it?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.904
- I am.

13:37.050 --> 13:41.452
- Trudy...

13:41.454 --> 13:43.321
Can you change that?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.223
- No.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.292
I don't need it.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.828
I'm starting to like it.

14:34.540 --> 14:39.077
- Hap?

14:39.079 --> 14:42.280
I have to tell you something.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.215
And you're probably
gonna hate me.

14:48.954 --> 14:53.391
After you left,
I did something.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.426
Something real, real bad.

15:00.499 --> 15:05.136
I killed cheep.

15:05.138 --> 15:09.340
I drowned him in the sink.

15:09.342 --> 15:13.611
He reminded me of us.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.948
Of you.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.017
How I was a failure at things.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.656
Told myself I had to move on.

15:29.061 --> 15:30.662
Be my own person.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.935
But when I did,
you were still there.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.438
You're always there.

15:45.077 --> 15:47.679
I love you, hap.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.790
See you on
the flip side, sugar.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.392
- Hell of a night for this.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.626
Don't worry,
I'm just here to help.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.694
- Thank you, sir.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.496
- What's going on here?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.698
- I don't rightly know.
Might be the transmission.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.766
- Yeah.

19:38.544 --> 19:41.512
- Daddy?

19:41.514 --> 19:42.547
- Help...

19:42.549 --> 19:44.248
- Daddy?

20:14.413 --> 20:17.415
So you made it.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.384
- And you, you too.

20:27.526 --> 20:31.529
- How long we been out?

20:31.531 --> 20:34.765
- Me, three days.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.467
You, longer.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.609
- Trudy?

20:53.385 --> 20:56.354
Sorry, hap.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.624
I mean that.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.333
Did you find it?

21:11.737 --> 21:13.838
- No.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.607
Not for lack of trying.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.776
- Goddamn health insurance.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.978
It ain't even paying for half
this shit.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.948
Almost lost a kidney.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.050
- I heard.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.787
- Busted my ass in
that damn war, and for what?

21:29.789 --> 21:32.023
Almost told them to give me
one of yours.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.637
You no good for me, hap collins.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.344
- Maybe not.

21:58.550 --> 22:03.487
Well...

22:03.489 --> 22:05.523
It's, um...

22:05.525 --> 22:10.027
It's good to see you.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.831
- Hap?
- Yeah?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.467
- Remember when I told you
you weren't my type?

22:16.469 --> 22:18.069
- Yeah?

22:18.071 --> 22:20.805
- Just wanted you to know
I meant it.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.873
- Thanks.

22:31.416 --> 22:32.583
- Hap collins?

22:32.585 --> 22:33.918
- Yes, sir.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.786
- Jack divit, fbi.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.822
Sheriff's office got
a statement from you.

22:37.824 --> 22:42.026
Now that you're feeling better,
we'd like to get one too.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.694
So now you say your ex-wife,
ms. Fawst,

22:43.696 --> 22:45.796
Didn't say why they were
searching for

22:45.798 --> 22:47.431
The sunken car,
is that right?

22:47.433 --> 22:49.700
- She just said this,
this howard guy

22:49.702 --> 22:52.103
Had an interest in it.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.438
Didn't say why.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.973
They were offering up
a chunk of change,

22:55.975 --> 22:58.008
So we didn't ask.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.877
- Must have been
a nice chunk of change

22:59.879 --> 23:02.713
For you to partner up with
your ex-wife's other ex-husband.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.149
- Ha, yeah, yeah, it was.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.651
- So after the car
was recovered,

23:07.653 --> 23:10.154
Did you find anything
special in it?

23:10.156 --> 23:12.623
- Well, there were...

23:12.625 --> 23:16.727
Two metal boxes
about so big.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.030
They were real secretive
about them, though.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.899
- Did they pay you
what they owe you?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.001
- No.
No, sir, they didn't.

23:24.003 --> 23:28.472
No, after the guns came out,
leonard and me were held

23:28.474 --> 23:32.543
Until soldier and angel arrived,
and...

23:32.545 --> 23:34.478
And all hell broke loose.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.182
- Does this name...
Softboy mccall ring a bell?

23:38.184 --> 23:40.451
- No, I ca--
I can't say it does.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.987
- He was this howard fella's
cellmate in leavenworth,

23:42.989 --> 23:45.523
Tied to a bank robber
a few decades ago.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.592
Some money came up missing
right around the same river.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.996
- Well.

23:51.998 --> 23:55.866
- I noticed that you have
a prison record of your own.

23:55.868 --> 24:01.539
- Are we--we gonna go to trial
or anything for this?

24:01.541 --> 24:04.074
- I mean, you don't end up
in a slaughterhouse like this

24:04.076 --> 24:06.777
And not have
some talking to do.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.447
You got a good case
for self-defense.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.515
Soldier and his partner,
this woman,

24:11.517 --> 24:14.552
We've had our eye on
for quite some time.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.887
That helps.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.825
I think we're done for now.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.694
If anything comes to mind
about this money,

24:23.696 --> 24:26.964
Give me a call?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.134
- Happy to.
- Have a good evening.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.602
Appreciate it.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.324
- God damn it.

26:28.353 --> 26:29.887
Here, switch.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.322
Out.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.964
- You okay, boy?

29:56.027 --> 29:57.995
- Hey.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.197
- You don't look so good, hap.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.467
- Yeah, well, I didn't
look so good before, so...

30:03.469 --> 30:05.969
How's he doing?

30:05.971 --> 30:11.975
- It's slow,
but he's healing.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.877
- Mind if I come in?

30:13.879 --> 30:17.014
- I don't think
it's a good idea.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.116
Don't take this the wrong way,
but maybe you shouldn't

30:19.118 --> 30:22.886
Come and see him for a while
for his sake.

30:22.888 --> 30:27.958
I think it's best if
he stays calm and relaxed.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.396
- Yeah.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.398
- Yeah.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.867
- Would you tell him
I dropped by?

30:36.869 --> 30:39.570
- If he asks.

30:39.572 --> 30:42.873
- Can you make sure
he gets this?

30:48.947 --> 30:51.582
- Have a good night, hap.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.983
- Yeah.

31:11.936 --> 31:13.403
<i>- It's taken care of,
mr. Otis.</i>

31:13.405 --> 31:15.305
<i>Wasn't your boy's fault.</i>

31:15.307 --> 31:18.141
Dumb coon pulled over out there
in the dark in a storm,

31:18.143 --> 31:20.110
No flares, no lights.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.880
Lucky thing your boy
wasn't hurt worse.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.883
- Thanks, tom.
Appreciate it.

31:25.885 --> 31:29.086
- Yes, sir, mr. Otis.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.621
Your daddy's a good man, beau.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.890
<i>Don't dwell on this.
Accidents happen.</i>

31:32.892 --> 31:34.224
<i>Put it behind you?</i>

31:34.226 --> 31:35.492
<i>- All right, sir.</i>

33:58.537 --> 34:00.670
- You look ridiculous.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.778
And you've been feeding
my damn dog too much,

34:07.780 --> 34:09.146
Making him fat.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.485
- When'd they let you out?

34:15.487 --> 34:18.422
- Yesterday.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.757
- How's your--
your, kidney?

34:21.760 --> 34:25.395
- It hurts.

34:25.397 --> 34:29.065
Raoul was right.
You look like shit.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.400
- Well, that's nice of him.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.504
Where is the little
ray of sunshine, with you?

34:34.505 --> 34:39.275
- We're taking a break
right now.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.112
- Again?

34:42.114 --> 34:44.414
- You know me and him.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.149
That little bugger
always hanging around

34:46.150 --> 34:50.219
Getting on my damn nerve.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.422
Anyway, thanks for the records.

34:58.729 --> 35:00.831
You working?

35:00.833 --> 35:05.469
- Roses, you know,
a couple of days a week.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.204
Them mexicans?

35:07.206 --> 35:09.372
Yeah, they got a better offer.

35:15.646 --> 35:18.515
- How long you been
like this, hap?

35:18.517 --> 35:22.552
- A while.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.187
- You okay?

35:24.189 --> 35:26.456
- Yeah, getting there, you know.

35:31.362 --> 35:34.831
- Well, anyway, I--

35:34.833 --> 35:38.168
I stopped by
to ask you for a favor.

35:38.170 --> 35:40.203
- Yeah?

35:40.205 --> 35:42.739
- Need you to accompany me
to a funeral

35:42.741 --> 35:46.343
And help me pick out a suit.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.879
- "yea, though I walk
through the valley

36:55.881 --> 37:00.951
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

37:00.953 --> 37:04.421
"for thou art with me.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.891
"thou prepareth a table
before me in the presence

37:07.893 --> 37:10.594
"of mine enemies.

37:10.596 --> 37:14.297
Thou anointest my head
with oil."

37:14.299 --> 37:17.601
- You got your tag on, slick.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.437
- "surely, goodness and
mercy..."

37:20.439 --> 37:21.771
- Sorry.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.407
- "shall follow me all the days
of my life.

37:24.409 --> 37:27.711
And I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever."

37:27.713 --> 37:29.312
Amen.

37:34.252 --> 37:38.655
- You're the only family
I got now, hap.

38:22.733 --> 38:25.802
- I thought your place
was a dump.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.904
- Well, it looks like he
had more practice.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.702
- Did he ever throw
anything out?

38:58.704 --> 39:01.438
- Just me.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.608
Seen roaches big enough in here
to own property.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.744
- Why don't you just help me
carry the trash out?

39:13.584 --> 39:17.520
Whatcha thinking?

39:17.522 --> 39:20.123
- Maybe I'll spend the night,
go through his stuff,

39:20.125 --> 39:23.360
See what's in the basement
before the county get here.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.999
- I should be good for coupons
for a while.

39:33.738 --> 39:37.807
- I don't suppose I could ask
you to spend the night with me.

39:40.478 --> 39:44.547
- What if I said no?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.149
- Long walk home.

39:58.763 --> 40:02.599
- You remember
"leave it to beaver"?

40:02.601 --> 40:04.534
- If you're gonna tell
the beaver joke,

40:04.536 --> 40:07.604
I already heard it.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.106
- Always ended it with
beaver and wally.

40:10.108 --> 40:13.676
And they'd sum up
what it was about

40:13.678 --> 40:17.580
And all they'd learned.

40:17.582 --> 40:22.419
And--so they could move on
to next week's show

40:22.421 --> 40:26.523
With no baggage.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.691
- So?

40:28.693 --> 40:30.693
- Well, life just
ain't like that.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.065
- No.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.634
No, it ain't.

40:42.206 --> 40:43.973
Good night, wally.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.845
- Good night, beav.

40:54.151 --> 40:57.520
No more drama for a while.
