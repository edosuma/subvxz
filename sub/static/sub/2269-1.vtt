01:04.665 --> 01:05.731
Alright, quiet, come on.

01:09.002 --> 01:13.806
Calm down.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.581
Who wants to see ghosts?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.215
Who wants to see some ghosts??

01:26.053 --> 01:28.254
Ghosts!

01:28.255 --> 01:30.556
Alright, that's better.

01:30.557 --> 01:34.627
First of all, hello, welcome.

01:34.628 --> 01:34.894
My name is David Williams, this
is my colleague, Clare McManus.

01:38.865 --> 01:42.134
We are archivists in the
National Film Archive.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.970
Today you're going to see a
series of films, dated from 1895
to 1905.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.507
It's worth bearing in mind that
everyone you see in these films
are long since dead

01:54.648 --> 01:56.248
all these people, men, women
and children have vanished off
the face of the earth forever.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.119
So, in a way, it's like
watching real ghosts.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.258
Alright, alright!

02:06.259 --> 02:08.193
Let's just watch it and see
what you think.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.566
Thanks.

02:47.567 --> 02:52.071
Don't worry.. she'll love it.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.178
Hi!

02:59.179 --> 03:02.081
Hey.. nice to see you!
How are you?

03:02.082 --> 03:03.482
This is my wife Alice.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.685
Hi
Hi! Great to meet you!

03:05.686 --> 03:07.687
So nice to finally meet you.
Sorry I couldn't make it the
last time. I was... busy

03:11.291 --> 03:12.692
No no no no... not at all!

03:12.693 --> 03:16.429
So... I'm going to let you go
on in, take a look for
yourselves.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.830
I'll be right here waiting for
you, take as much time as you
need.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.432
Alright, thank you.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.401
Come on then!

03:30.577 --> 03:34.880
Go on; you first.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.727
Are you coming?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.128
No. I'm too nervous.

03:49.129 --> 03:54.600
Go on, you go round.

04:57.631 --> 05:03.803
I love it!

05:26.293 --> 05:29.361
Alice..

05:29.362 --> 05:30.629
you got a message.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.402
..you got a message

05:39.739 --> 05:42.408
Who is it?

05:42.409 --> 05:43.809
Mam..

05:43.810 --> 05:45.211
Dad

05:45.212 --> 05:46.612
Hey sweetie...

05:46.613 --> 05:49.215
I heard a noise and I woke up
and now I need to go toilet.

05:52.118 --> 05:52.451
I'll go.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.297
Da.. are you afraid of the
dark?

06:08.735 --> 06:11.070
No. Of course not.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.471
Why, are you?

06:12.472 --> 06:12.771
No, but there could be
something hiding in the dark

06:16.209 --> 06:18.377
Hmmm.. like what?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.245
Monsters.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.885
Night night. Ok. I love you.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.386
Night Dad, love you.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.554
Do you want to tell me
dinosaurs I can name

06:31.992 --> 06:33.459
Maybe tomorrow.

06:33.460 --> 06:33.659
Can you say night night to my
dragon heads?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.031
Good night!

06:48.108 --> 06:50.910
Is he alright?

06:50.910 --> 06:56.915
Yeah, he's fine.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.123
Who was the message from?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.457
Steve.

07:08.728 --> 07:13.432
In work.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.702
Just because he doesn't have a
life he thinks everyone else
should be on a 24 hour call.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.369
I'm sorry. I should have
switched it off earlier.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.183
I love you.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.733
Good night.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.116
What time do you start work?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.918
What's this?
Not 'til 10.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.154
Alright, come on.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.259
Have a good day, sweetheart.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.962
Bye. Love you. You too.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.063
Thank you.

08:54.401 --> 08:55.801
Bye boys!

08:55.802 --> 08:57.736
Bye Mam!

09:00.840 --> 09:02.174
Allosaurus, Bwontosaurus,
T-Rex, Triceratops, Stegosaurus,
that's the best one!

09:10.550 --> 09:12.418
Wow! God you're getting so
clever, that's more than I can
name!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.157
Do you think I'd be able to
swim in there?

09:18.158 --> 09:21.293
No way.. no.. it's too deep.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.995
Would you be able to swim in
there?

09:22.996 --> 09:24.696
No..

09:24.697 --> 09:25.364
No It's too deep for me too.

09:28.101 --> 09:28.734
Billy... Billy..

09:34.541 --> 09:37.109
Billy! Billy!!

09:37.110 --> 09:39.445
Hey don't go in there, I told
you

09:39.446 --> 09:43.182
A girl in our school saw a
ghost in there

09:43.183 --> 09:43.348
Well I don't know about ghosts,
but there could be rats in
there.

09:46.719 --> 09:46.985
It's filthy.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.155
Mmm?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.526
Can I throw a stone and see
if a ghost comes out?

09:54.527 --> 09:55.928
Throw a stone?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.329
Alright, just one.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.797
Then we've got to go.

09:58.798 --> 09:59.097
You got one?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.738
Ok?

10:06.739 --> 10:08.140
Can I throw another one?

10:08.141 --> 10:10.309
No! Come on, we're going to be
late.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.647
I'll pick you up later.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.049
Bye Dad!

10:17.050 --> 10:21.386
Have a good day.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.123
I hope you feel better than
you look.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.960
I didn't get much sleep last
night.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.260
Mmm!

10:29.329 --> 10:30.762
Why, do I look that bad?

10:30.763 --> 10:31.396
Mmm..

10:32.832 --> 10:33.131
<i>o worse than usual!</i>

10:35.502 --> 10:36.435
Anyway, I probably don't look
much better!

10:37.804 --> 10:41.573
I was up til 4am watching
Cat People and the Curse of
the...

10:41.574 --> 10:44.476
Cat People? It was on?
I love that movie!

10:44.477 --> 10:45.010
Yeah.. I was going to give you
a call, but... I figured you
need your beauty sleep!

10:48.448 --> 10:50.482
Yeah.. very funny.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.886
Listen, I don't mean to spoil
the day with work, but some
films came into the archive;

10:56.489 --> 10:57.856
some from the police archive,
could be interesting.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.259
Yeah

11:01.427 --> 11:02.494
Would you look at them for me?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.228
Sure

11:03.229 --> 11:05.964
Great. Thanks.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.821
Hey.. that's my road.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.573
I had a really strange day
today.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.142
I watched a 1902 film, our
house was in it.

11:50.143 --> 11:50.742
There was a murder here. A man
killed his wife. It happened in
this room.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.681
What?

11:55.682 --> 12:00.018
I wouldn't worry about it.
Horrible things happen in every
old house.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.689
Only these dinosaurs rule
their...

12:09.862 --> 12:11.797
You look amazing Mrs Williams!

12:13.800 --> 12:16.568
Oh!
Thank you, Sophie!

12:16.569 --> 12:18.003
This is my husband, David.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.404
Hi!

12:19.405 --> 12:20.806
Hi.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.641
Sophie used to be the nanny for
the Thompsons, two doors down.

12:22.642 --> 12:23.108
Mam, Sophie never even
heard of Stegosaurus.

12:27.146 --> 12:31.550
Well, not everyone knows
about dinosaurs, you know!

12:31.551 --> 12:34.286
OK, make yourself at home,
and help yourself to any food
in the kitchen.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.188
We shouldn't be home too late.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.560
See you tomorrow.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.961
Sleep well.

12:42.962 --> 12:49.067
Pleased to meet you.

12:58.811 --> 13:01.146
Alice!

13:01.147 --> 13:02.547
Hi!

13:02.548 --> 13:04.416
Alex is here.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.518
I'm sure you remember David,
my husband.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.920
Hi

13:08.921 --> 13:09.087
You're the, eh, the librarian?

13:11.891 --> 13:12.491
The... archivist.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.794
Nice to see you again.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.598
You too.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.533
I'm sure you won't mind if I
borrow your lovely wife for a
couple of moments there's somebody I'd really
like her to meet.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.601
No no, not at all!

13:22.602 --> 13:25.671
I'll get a drink.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.133
Can I help you sir?

13:55.134 --> 13:58.203
Can I get a..

13:58.204 --> 14:01.239
another gin and tonic.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.845
Hi.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.279
I'm sorry about all that.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.781
What was all that about?

14:42.782 --> 14:44.382
Um..

14:44.383 --> 14:45.984
work stuff.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.020
He wanted me to meet this
client, but I didn't want to.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.790
Not tonight.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.492
I thought he was the client.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.893
Yes...

14:54.894 --> 14:56.294
he is.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.696
But he wanted me to meet
another one.

14:57.697 --> 15:02.501
A colleague of his.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.804
Let's dance.

15:07.540 --> 15:07.839
I'm just going to finish this.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.263
I love you.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.829
Whoa!

16:03.830 --> 16:05.163
Sorry! I couldn't resist.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.935
You alright?

16:09.936 --> 16:11.336
Yeah.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.737
You look pale.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.139
No I'm alright.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.540
Yeah?

16:15.541 --> 16:16.942
Paler than usual, even.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.343
Um..

16:21.514 --> 16:24.816
I have the last 7 or 8 of those
donated films lined up in the
screening room, take a look?

16:24.817 --> 16:25.884
Yeah, sure.

16:58.317 --> 17:02.487
Twinkle twinkle little star,
how I wonder what you are.

17:02.488 --> 17:09.527
Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky..

18:11.157 --> 18:13.792
Kiss!

18:13.793 --> 18:16.061
Bye boy.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.929
Bye Mum.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.597
Wait for your Dad, Billy!

18:23.235 --> 18:26.471
Hey, don't work late tonight.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.872
Come straight home.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.274
Why?

18:29.275 --> 18:32.510
What's wrong?

18:32.511 --> 18:34.212
I won't be too late, I
promise.

18:37.416 --> 18:43.688
Bye.

19:31.570 --> 19:31.736
Alice!

19:34.974 --> 19:38.943
Alice!

19:48.154 --> 19:49.521
Hello?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.825
Dad! I'm still at school,
are you collecting me?

19:53.826 --> 19:57.362
Dad, did you forget about me?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.797
I just lost track of time.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.331
I'm sorry.

20:00.332 --> 20:04.836
Adam and me were the only ones
left.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.771
Adam said a gowilla could beat
a winosaurus in a fight, is
that true?

20:10.009 --> 20:16.114
No.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.610
The master wants you.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.282
The master wants you.

24:30.836 --> 24:31.502
David...

24:34.106 --> 24:34.906
please..
don't..

24:37.076 --> 24:38.343
I don't want to...

24:39.411 --> 24:41.179
David...

24:43.082 --> 24:45.516
please..
don't..

24:47.152 --> 24:48.920
I don't want to die

26:00.058 --> 26:01.959
Hi, it's Alice here, sorry I
missed your call.

26:01.960 --> 26:06.497
If you want to leave your name
and number I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Thanks.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.423
Detective McNamara.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.137
So, when did you last see her?

26:46.138 --> 26:47.738
Em.. yesterday morning.

26:47.739 --> 26:48.239
We said good bye, I took
Billy, my son, to school.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.511
And has she stayed out all
night before?

26:53.512 --> 26:54.912
No.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.314
No, never.

26:59.718 --> 27:03.054
She said she was working late
last night, but I asked a work
colleague of hersand she said Alice left
around about five.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.589
Did you have an argument?

27:04.590 --> 27:05.990
No.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.391
You sure?

27:07.392 --> 27:09.560
Yeah.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.129
You been in touch with her
family and friends?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.531
Yes.

27:13.532 --> 27:14.932
And they've heard nothing from
her?

27:14.933 --> 27:16.334
No.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.406
Ok..

27:25.744 --> 27:27.144
Hair colour?

27:37.856 --> 27:39.290
Some of them are a little old.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.258
That's all I could find.

27:43.529 --> 27:44.929
Dad..

27:44.930 --> 27:48.399
when will mummy be coming back?

27:48.400 --> 27:52.403
I told you... she'll be home
soon. Don't worry.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.811
Pretty..

28:36.448 --> 28:37.882
Hey.

28:37.883 --> 28:38.249
Hiya.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.721
Is there any news?

28:47.092 --> 28:48.492
How's Billy?

28:48.493 --> 28:49.894
Yeah, he's fine.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.463
I put him to bed about an hour
ago.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.998
He wanted to sleep in your
room.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.438
Do you know there's black
stuff on your hands.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.174
They took my fingerprints to
eliminate me.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.642
In case there's an
investigation.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.647
Em.. I put Billy to bed about
an hour ago.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.419
He wanted to sleep in your
room.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.487
He's fine. All day. We get on
really well!

29:20.258 --> 29:22.693
He's a great kid, I really
like him.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.795
I get to know everything about
dinosaurs!

29:24.796 --> 29:24.996
Yeah!

29:28.400 --> 29:29.867
I'd better go.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.469
Yeah.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.870
Thanks.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.271
Yeah.

29:34.272 --> 29:39.877
See you in the morning.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.291
Billy... Billy! What are you
looking at?

30:29.928 --> 30:32.463
Come here...

30:36.068 --> 30:37.468
I had a dream about Mammy.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.304
I miss her.

31:17.943 --> 31:18.609
Man came forward yesterday
claiming to be your wife's
lover.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.615
Says he was with her the
night she disappeared.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.453
They've been seeing each other
for about a year.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.759
You know anything about that?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.127
No.

31:41.967 --> 31:44.301
Well, according to him,
she was planning to leave you.

31:44.302 --> 31:45.703
That's impossible.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.104
She loves me.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.506
She has a lover, David.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.975
He's lying!

31:50.976 --> 31:54.745
Well, several of her friends
have backed him up.

31:54.746 --> 31:59.016
By all accounts, she was in
love with the bloke, and he with
her.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.396
Sorry.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.632
Fucking acid reflux.

32:18.336 --> 32:19.904
Total fucking pain in the
arse.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.042
Want one of these?

32:25.043 --> 32:26.377
No.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.048
I've got a very weak stomach,
David.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.857
You didn't kill her, did you?

32:39.858 --> 32:40.157
You've no right to be asking
me these things.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.628
I love, I love my wife.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.267
I'd never, I'd never do
anything to hurt her.

32:53.538 --> 32:57.641
Never.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.109
Are you asking her lover
these questions, are you?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.511
Yeah.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.912
You asking him if he killed
her?

33:01.913 --> 33:03.948
Yeah.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.482
He's got an alibi.

33:05.483 --> 33:09.620
His boss called just as she
was leaving his house,

33:09.621 --> 33:11.689
they both heard her insist
on going home by herself

33:11.690 --> 33:19.196
and then stayed on the phone
for over an hour, so it's cast
iron mate!

33:23.134 --> 33:25.169
Uh..

33:25.170 --> 33:28.372
people always suspect the
husband.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.841
Do you know why that is?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.811
Cause it's always the husband.

33:33.812 --> 33:37.848
Every fucking time.

35:09.307 --> 35:12.476
Is this your wife?

35:12.477 --> 35:15.112
This your wife, Alice
Williams?

35:18.316 --> 35:20.017
Yes.

35:20.018 --> 35:23.821
Yes, it's my wife.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.089
There was no evidence of foul
play or assault.

35:28.426 --> 35:31.895
She drowned.

35:31.896 --> 35:32.229
She must have fallen in.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.101
It was an accident?

35:37.102 --> 35:38.769
Yes.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.939
I think so.

35:41.940 --> 35:45.943
One of the heels of her shoe
had snapped off, which we think
may have caused her to fall in.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.946
So in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary,

35:48.947 --> 35:52.116
we have to conclude
that it was an accident, yes.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.856
Do you agree?

35:58.857 --> 36:02.760
You did know she was pregnant?

36:43.468 --> 36:46.170
Very sorry for your troubles.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.238
Thank you.

36:51.476 --> 36:54.111
Nana.

36:54.112 --> 36:58.148
Ohh!

37:00.118 --> 37:01.485
She loved you.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.922
You know that, don't you?

37:07.859 --> 37:09.693
Yes?

37:09.694 --> 37:11.095
Yes?

37:11.096 --> 37:12.496
She loved you.

37:12.497 --> 37:13.163
More than anything else in the
whole world.

37:16.367 --> 37:19.136
Yes.

37:19.137 --> 37:19.436
Oh Billy!

37:22.674 --> 37:24.241
Billy.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.642
Billy!

37:25.643 --> 37:31.115
Come on, go with Clare, ok?

37:34.586 --> 37:36.820
How's he doing?

37:36.821 --> 37:39.556
Yeah, he's alright.

37:39.557 --> 37:41.058
Children are strong.

37:41.059 --> 37:41.592
They are stronger than most
adults, even.

37:45.597 --> 37:49.366
Of course, they don't really
understand, do they?

37:51.736 --> 37:53.070
Maybe I should take him for a
while.

37:55.406 --> 37:58.075
It might be good for him.

37:58.076 --> 38:01.044
I think Alice would have liked
that.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.214
He should be around another
woman.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.417
A mother figure.

38:07.418 --> 38:09.052
We've got Sophie living with
us now...

38:09.053 --> 38:10.587
Billy's nanny...

38:10.588 --> 38:16.627
I think it's best if stays
home with me.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.767
Did you hear about Alex?

38:23.768 --> 38:26.036
Alex?

38:26.037 --> 38:27.871
Alice's boyfriend.

38:27.872 --> 38:28.238
Apparently he's taken
Alice's death very badly.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.378
He's completely devastated.

38:34.379 --> 38:36.513
They say he need to go into a
hospital.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.615
To recover.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.784
Yes.

38:40.785 --> 38:41.018
I couldn't give a shit.

38:44.522 --> 38:45.923
Do you understand me?

38:45.924 --> 38:48.192
I couldn't care less, I have
my son.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.331
A lot of people loved her.

38:54.332 --> 38:59.603
I loved her.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.940
I have to go.

39:05.610 --> 39:10.113
Just say goodbye to Billy.

39:11.649 --> 39:13.584
It's been a long day.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.399
You alright?

39:32.670 --> 39:33.537
I lied.

39:37.141 --> 39:38.542
I, eh, I lied to the police.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.244
I did know about that guy in
the house

39:40.245 --> 39:41.678
Oh...

39:41.679 --> 39:44.681
em...

39:44.682 --> 39:47.417
it doesn't really matter now
anyway, does it.

39:47.418 --> 39:49.152
It was an accident.

39:49.153 --> 39:52.356
The thing is...

39:52.357 --> 39:55.692
on the night she disappeared

39:55.693 --> 39:57.794
I went to his house,

39:57.795 --> 39:58.729
that guy, and I went in after
them

40:02.367 --> 40:04.434
and I saw them together in bed.

40:07.972 --> 40:11.308
I didn't do anything.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.743
You know, I could have done, but
I didn't. I just left.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.411
They didn't even see me.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.380
On the way home I felt..

40:16.381 --> 40:20.217
so sick, I just had to go to
the public toilets

40:20.218 --> 40:20.450
beside the canal and I just
threw up, everywhere,

40:24.555 --> 40:28.692
and I remember, I was just
being sick, and I looked up,

40:28.693 --> 40:31.695
and there was someone looking
over the cubicle wall at me.

40:31.696 --> 40:33.430
It was a man.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.667
I managed to get to the door,
and just before I blacked out

40:36.668 --> 40:40.237
I swear I saw him with his
hands around her throat,

40:40.238 --> 40:43.607
and he was, he was trying to
kill her.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.811
He was killing her, and I
couldn't move, I couldn't do
anything.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.216
And then when she didn't come
back home the next day..

40:53.217 --> 40:56.253
I mean, what I seen was real..
Clare...

40:56.254 --> 40:57.654
it was really real.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.389
Then you need to tell the
police.

41:00.992 --> 41:04.094
Tell em what, what I told you,
I don't even,

41:04.095 --> 41:06.463
I don't even know
what the man looked like.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.864
It doesn't matter, tell them
anyway

41:07.865 --> 41:08.365
Once I tell them I followed
Alice into that house, that is
it.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.036
Alright?

41:13.037 --> 41:14.971
They'll, they'll just,
they'll just think it was me.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.307
What are you going to do?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.343
I have to find him first.

41:19.344 --> 41:22.346
I just have to.

43:19.697 --> 43:22.799
David!

43:22.800 --> 43:25.635
David!

43:25.636 --> 43:27.037
What?

43:27.038 --> 43:28.405
The old camera.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.241
Eh, no, sorry.

43:31.242 --> 43:32.642
I'll do it now.

43:32.643 --> 43:34.044
It's ok.

43:34.045 --> 43:35.445
Do it in the morning.

43:35.446 --> 43:36.880
What's this?

43:36.881 --> 43:40.350
It's just..

43:40.351 --> 43:43.487
eh, just..

43:43.488 --> 43:46.990
unsolved crimes.

43:46.991 --> 43:47.157
Murders that happened
in the city around the canal.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.363
I found it online.

43:53.364 --> 43:54.898
Just going through it.

43:54.899 --> 43:58.034
See if I can find
similarities.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.937
David.

44:00.938 --> 44:01.471
You should be taking time to
grieve, not thinking about stuff
like this.

44:04.942 --> 44:07.477
I'll find something.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.145
Yeah, I just have to keep
looking, that's all.

44:23.127 --> 44:26.363
Dad, look what we did!

44:26.364 --> 44:28.798
Wow! It's great!

44:28.799 --> 44:30.200
I hope you don't mind.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.601
I know how busy you are.

44:31.602 --> 44:33.603
No, course not.

44:33.604 --> 44:35.005
I totally forgot.

44:35.006 --> 44:38.408
Dad, lift me up, so I can
put the angel on top.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.709
You want to put the
angel on top, do you?

44:43.181 --> 44:46.082
Up right the top.

44:46.083 --> 44:46.449
You ready?

44:49.954 --> 44:51.555
Wherever you want..

44:51.556 --> 44:57.594
1-2-3.. come on, reach!

45:26.123 --> 45:30.360
Sorry for disturbing you.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.596
I was thinking that we could
make a real effort with the
decorations and stuff this year.

45:36.367 --> 45:37.767
I think it would be good for
Billy.

45:37.768 --> 45:41.304
What do you think? I could
buy more lights for the stars.

45:41.305 --> 45:41.871
And yes, I thought I could
decorate all the other rooms
and stuff..

45:45.543 --> 45:48.411
make it, like, really
Christmassy.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.813
Yeah.

45:49.814 --> 45:51.514
Yeah.
That sounds a good idea.

45:51.515 --> 45:52.882
Are you alright?

45:56.554 --> 45:59.623
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.162
Mr Williams.

46:06.163 --> 46:08.798
Night Sophie.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.392
Do you want us to move?

47:09.393 --> 47:15.565
No it's ok, stay where you
are.

47:50.901 --> 47:51.501
Hello..

47:53.137 --> 47:55.338
is someone there?

48:56.634 --> 48:58.268
Sophie?

49:01.872 --> 49:03.273
Sorry!

49:04.775 --> 49:06.176
Ah..

49:06.177 --> 49:07.577
sorry.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.079
Sorry..

49:12.416 --> 49:13.983
Look, could you come
to my room for a second?

49:17.888 --> 49:20.890
Why?

49:20.891 --> 49:25.061
Eh, just for a second.

49:31.702 --> 49:34.471
Don't you... listen! It's
really faint.

49:34.472 --> 49:35.872
What is it?

49:35.873 --> 49:38.975
Just listen.

49:40.945 --> 49:42.278
You hear it?

49:43.747 --> 49:45.615
I can't hear anything.

49:49.019 --> 49:50.420
No it's stopped.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.388
There's something behind
there.

49:52.389 --> 49:53.790
Maybe it's just a rah.

49:53.791 --> 49:55.191
No no.

49:55.192 --> 49:58.495
It's not a rat.

49:58.496 --> 50:01.798
I can't hear anything.

50:01.799 --> 50:04.000
What can you hear?

50:04.001 --> 50:06.603
It's whispering like someone's
praying.

50:10.441 --> 50:12.041
Maybe it's just from the house
next door.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.243
No...

50:16.814 --> 50:19.382
the walls are too solid.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.784
Dad what are you doing I was
asleep?

50:21.785 --> 50:23.520
Billy..

50:23.521 --> 50:24.921
Billy go to bed.

50:24.922 --> 50:26.322
It's alright.

50:26.323 --> 50:27.724
It's nothing.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.259
Everything's ok.

50:29.260 --> 50:31.628
Take him to bed, will you.

50:31.929 --> 50:34.864
Come on.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.568
We have to go to bed.

50:38.569 --> 50:39.969
I want to stay.

50:39.970 --> 50:45.742
What's Dad doing?

51:55.045 --> 51:57.213
What's wrong??

52:03.087 --> 52:05.321
Billy, go to your room, get
dressed.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.457
You and Sophie are getting out
of here.

52:07.458 --> 52:07.857
I'm just going to put the belt
on you.

52:11.228 --> 52:13.596
There we go.

52:13.597 --> 52:14.998
Alright, I'll see you
tomorrow.

52:14.999 --> 52:17.033
I love you.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.107
I'm not sure about this.

52:24.108 --> 52:26.342
I'm sorry, sorry about this.

52:26.343 --> 52:28.911
You're just going to have to
trust me. Alright?

52:28.912 --> 52:31.080
It's not safe here, It's not
safe for you and Billy.

52:31.081 --> 52:33.049
Everything is paid for at
the hotel, they're expecting
you

52:36.253 --> 52:37.654
OK

52:37.655 --> 52:39.555
You can buy anything
you want on room service.

52:39.556 --> 52:40.957
I'll see you tomorrow.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.358
Thanks.

52:42.359 --> 52:46.829
Yeah.

52:47.865 --> 52:50.600
Come on...
come on...

52:53.904 --> 52:55.038
Ok, it's just coming up...

52:55.939 --> 52:58.307
Ok there..

52:59.043 --> 53:00.877
there it is, you see it?

53:00.878 --> 53:01.811
Yes..

53:02.212 --> 53:02.979
I see it.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.414
There's someone there.

53:04.415 --> 53:05.248
Ok, there's more..

53:05.249 --> 53:06.683
just wait...

53:06.684 --> 53:07.450
and there...
there...

53:09.653 --> 53:11.087
you see his outline?

53:11.088 --> 53:11.554
It's hard to tell, it could
just be a shadow

53:13.090 --> 53:15.625
Oh come on, there's someone
there.

53:15.626 --> 53:16.759
Maybe. It's really hard to
tell

53:20.364 --> 53:23.032
Tell me you believe this ok?

53:23.033 --> 53:24.434
Believe what?

53:24.435 --> 53:28.071
This is the man that killed
Alice.

53:28.072 --> 53:31.040
This is the same man that I saw
on the night that she was
murdered.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.442
What do you mean?

53:32.443 --> 53:33.176
I think there's ghosts in my
house.

53:36.480 --> 53:40.850
David!...

53:40.851 --> 53:41.751
I know this sounds crazy,
believe me, I know how fucking
crazy this sounds, but I've seen things, I've
heard things, it's the only
rational explanation

53:44.988 --> 53:46.389
Hmmm..

53:46.390 --> 53:47.824
I don't think it is!

53:47.825 --> 53:49.225
Yes it is!

53:49.226 --> 53:50.626
Ok, ok, wait until you hear
this.

53:50.627 --> 53:52.762
In the 1930's they held
seances in my house,

53:52.763 --> 53:54.964
the people said they saw a
shadowy figure,
a shadowy figure

53:54.965 --> 53:57.366
It's a coincidence, that's all.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.502
The previous owner, right, the
estate agent told us it was an
old lady that went senile,

54:02.873 --> 54:04.741
but it wasn't.

54:04.742 --> 54:06.876
They lied to us.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.711
She was a young woman who tried
to burn her house down while her
family was asleep.

54:12.916 --> 54:13.549
Now her son died in the fire,
but she swore she didn't do
it.

54:17.020 --> 54:18.488
Like me with Alice.

54:18.489 --> 54:20.556
She said it was the demon.

54:20.557 --> 54:23.392
She said a man she couldn't see
tried to rape her.

54:23.393 --> 54:26.496
She said he was a demon
who lived behind the walls.

54:26.497 --> 54:27.897
The walls, Clare.

54:27.898 --> 54:29.298
Stop for a moment.

54:29.299 --> 54:32.368
Stop for one moment.

54:32.369 --> 54:36.372
Will you just think about what
you're saying.

54:36.373 --> 54:40.009
You think I'm having a
nervous breakdown don't you?

54:40.410 --> 54:43.379
Well maybe I am.

54:48.585 --> 54:49.986
No.

54:49.987 --> 54:51.387
Well maybe...

54:51.388 --> 54:52.555
You're just exhausted.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.326
Ok?

54:57.327 --> 54:59.662
Yeah.

55:11.008 --> 55:13.409
Billy?

55:13.410 --> 55:16.946
Sophie?

55:16.947 --> 55:20.016
Billy can you hear me?

55:20.017 --> 55:21.951
Dad why did you not come to
see us today?

55:21.952 --> 55:23.820
I'm sorry.

55:23.821 --> 55:26.022
I wanted to, I just wasn't
feeling very well.

55:26.023 --> 55:29.325
Can you come in and see us
tomorrow?

55:29.326 --> 55:30.726
Yeah.

55:30.727 --> 55:33.963
Yeah, promise.

55:33.964 --> 55:35.364
What have you had to eat?

55:35.365 --> 55:35.698
We had burgers, chips,
icecream and coke for dinner.

55:38.936 --> 55:40.837
Wow..

55:40.838 --> 55:44.841
My tummy is big, look how fat
I am Dad!

56:16.373 --> 56:19.575
Billy is Sophie back in the
room with you?

56:19.576 --> 56:23.880
No she's still in the shower.

56:25.682 --> 56:27.817
Billy I want you to move
the laptop around, ok?

56:29.286 --> 56:31.654
Just move the laptop around so
I can see the rest of the room,
go on.

56:31.655 --> 56:34.156
Please?

56:34.157 --> 56:35.091
Keep moving...

56:36.059 --> 56:37.526
keep moving the laptop.

56:37.527 --> 56:38.160
That's it.
Good boy.

56:40.230 --> 56:40.296
keep moving some more...

56:41.732 --> 56:42.098
that's it...

56:43.533 --> 56:43.833
just need to see the...

56:44.902 --> 56:45.501
the room.

56:48.171 --> 56:49.138
What is that?

56:56.680 --> 56:58.080
Billy...

56:58.081 --> 56:59.482
BILLY!

56:59.483 --> 57:00.883
BILLY GET OUT OF THE ROOM!!

57:00.884 --> 57:02.285
BILLY!!!!

57:02.286 --> 57:07.423
Ahhh!!

57:47.731 --> 57:53.869
How did you get here so fast?

58:29.673 --> 58:30.172
Mr Williams?

58:34.011 --> 58:37.813
I'm not sure if I can work
here anymore.

58:37.814 --> 58:40.783
I don't know what's going on.

58:40.784 --> 58:42.184
And..

58:42.185 --> 58:45.621
if it wasn't for Billy I think
I'd leave right now.

58:47.391 --> 58:48.958
I understand.

58:54.431 --> 58:55.131
Yeah you're right, you should
go.

58:59.002 --> 59:01.370
I can't guarantee your safety
anymore and...

59:05.008 --> 59:08.411
it's not safe to be around us.

59:08.412 --> 59:09.912
I don't want to leave Billy
behind...

59:13.950 --> 59:15.718
but I really don't think
you're well, Mr Williams.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.992
Maybe if you told me what was
going on I could understand or I
could help.

59:26.763 --> 59:30.332
Please Sophie, you must go
tomorrow.

59:32.769 --> 59:34.136
You better sleep in here with
us tonight.

59:36.640 --> 59:37.106
I'll take the floor, you can
have the bed.

59:40.544 --> 59:41.944
No it's alright.

59:41.945 --> 59:43.345
I'll be ok.

59:43.346 --> 59:44.747
No.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.148
No, no, please.

59:46.149 --> 59:48.551
You won't.

59:48.552 --> 59:49.819
Mr Williams, I want to talk to
you about this again in the
morning.

59:53.423 --> 59:53.622
About me leaving, I mean.

59:56.860 --> 59:59.995
Yeah.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.664
Goodnight.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.473
Come on...

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.477
Come on...

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.146
No..

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.163
No!... what are you doing??

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:15.564
Arrhhh!

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.633
Just come down the stairs..

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:20.936
Let me out!

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.474
Let me out!!

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:29.745
Mr Williams!!

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.184
Where's Dad, who's in the
house?

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:40.889
I don't know...

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.926
No-one

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.868
Mr Williams, let me out.

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.171
Let us out..

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.809
Billy's afraid..

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.650
I've checked everywhere

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:10.953
Dad!

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.921
Me and Billy..

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:14.456
were following somebody
outside...

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.660
Ok then I heard you screaming.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:21.163
They're trying to separate us.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:21.363
Did you see anyone up there?

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.268
Did you?

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:28.437
Come on Billy!

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:30.439
No..

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.576
Billy's staying with me.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.846
Sophie!...

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:01.537
Billy...

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.374
Do you ever see other people
in the house?

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.482
Billy..

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.651
if you see someone,
you know you have to tell me?

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.052
Did you?

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.254
Are you sure?

01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:23.892
Where's Sophie?

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.865
She left this morning.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:32.968
She's not coming back.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.747
Billy..

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.148
do you see that woman?

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.684
Where?

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:50.085
There...

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.954
you see, she's hiding in the
long grass?

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:55.023
I don't see anyone.

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:11.507
Are we going to see my teacher
today?

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.111
No.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.081
Not today.

01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.790
Billy..
Billy get back.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.224
Go on. Get back...

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.193
go... go hide behind the wall.

01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:41.270
Go on...

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.671
turn around...turn around,
count to 10.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.072
Ok?

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.073
One...

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:45.941
two...
go on...

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:49.111
1...

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.949
2...

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.088
...4...

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.701
...10!

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:20.709
Is this a game of hide and
seek, can I open my eyes now?

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.555
Clare...

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.957
David..

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:36.358
you Ok?

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.793
Hi, Billy!

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:40.262
Hi!

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:41.663
Eh..

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.065
I need to develop this.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.733
What is it?

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.401
It's nothing.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.705
Just let me develop it,
it won't take me long.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:49.938
You have to tell me what it is
first.

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:53.609
Please, Clare, don't make me
beg.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:57.846
I need to see this.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:02.518
Please.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.486
Ok.

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:06.255
But it'll be a couple of days
though.

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:07.656
No.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.424
No, I need to see it today...

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.826
em...

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:12.227
well...

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:13.795
I need to see it now.

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.564
It's fully booked in here.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:15.931
Ok, I'll get it done, promise.

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:21.537
I'll even drop it down to you
when it's done, Ok?

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:26.341
Look...

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:29.444
I've been thinking...

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:29.878
maybe you should talk to
someone?

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.652
A bereavement counsellor or
something.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:39.888
Just...

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:48.130
think about it, Ok?

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:58.840
If anyone walks here tonight,
we'll see their footsteps

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.342
It's like snow!

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:01.743
Can I have a go?

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.445
Yeah!

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:07.249
Now no one can get in without
us knowing.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:31.673
You're like me

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:59.294
What's with all the powder,
Dave?

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.763
It's flour from the kitchen.

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.165
Oh..

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:04.566
is that right?

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.501
What's with all the flour,
are you making a cake?

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.637
What do you want?

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.038
Get your clothes on.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:10.839
You're coming with me.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:15.644
We found a hammer in the canal,
with your fingerprints on it.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.015
A hammer that belonged to your
wife's lover.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.255
He says it went missing
the night she disappeared.

01:10:27.256 --> 01:10:27.989
Can you explain that?

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.161
There was a murder in my house
in..

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:35.997
in 1902.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.566
What...

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:38.333
You could look all of this is
up; and a man killed his whole
family.

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.638
You understand me...

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.640
and I think he was the one who
did it.

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:46.241
I have proof, I've captured
something on film.

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:51.046
It's a ghost.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:56.084
You can see it in a few days.

01:10:58.454 --> 01:10:59.087
As the senior welfare officer I
have no choice but to recommend
his case to social

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.194
services and recommend that
the child is taken into care.

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.764
Isn't that a little harsh?

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.365
Mr Williams has just lost his
wife.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:14.970
His symptoms are clearly
part of a grieving process.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:15.437
Are locking nannies in
cupboards and hearing voices
behind walls part of the
grieving process?

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:24.546
It was only one nanny and
people react differently to the
death of a loved one

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:32.547
and, by the way, this is the
same nanny that Mr Williams
caught smoking drugs in her
room, so...

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.003
No way!

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.404
No way!!

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:51.973
Yes.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:55.243
Yes, we can do that.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.612
We'll wait for the report back
from the psychiatrist and then
we'll see what to do after that.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.554
I'm not going to a
psychiatrist.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:07.022
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:08.423
You have to.

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:09.457
We agreed to it.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.892
You did.
I didn't.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:11.927
I'm not going.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:14.796
I have to get back to Billy

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.907
Dad...

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:28.109
who are those men?

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.511
They're the police.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:34.649
Don't look.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:45.560
Don't look.

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:51.032
Is there somebody outside?

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:55.670
No.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.606
Dad..

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:03.712
What?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.680
You'd never leave me, would
you?

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.850
No.

01:13:10.286 --> 01:13:12.854
Of course not.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:16.524
What if you die like Mammy,
what would happen to me then?

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.095
I'll never leave you, Billy.

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:23.899
Never.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.537
And we'll always be together,
you and me.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.238
Ok?

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:36.878
Right now, close your eyes.

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:16.931
Did you watch it?

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.766
No.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.070
Would you...

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:27.275
would you watch it with me?

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:27.642
I'm afraid to watch it on my
own.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.149
Ok.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.550
Ok.

01:17:35.551 --> 01:17:35.917
Come watch on TV...

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:56.938
David... do you
remember calling me last night?

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:00.375
Last night?
No.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:03.178
You did.

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:09.284
You were delirious, I
hardly recognised your voice.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:13.288
You were crying.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:21.095
You said you wanted to
tell me something about Alice.

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.799
That wasn't me.
I didn't call you.

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:29.237
Sit down.

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:39.681
If you did hurt her, if you
did do it, maybe you should
just...

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:47.956
get it over with...
go to the police.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:55.230
I'll go with you if you want
me to.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.899
I'll tell them what a good
person you are.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:04.372
I'll help you.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:07.041
Clare they sacrificed children
in this room...

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.411
don't you know?

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:15.984
David what are you talking
about?

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:19.120
Baby's blood is the most
powerful, you see?

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:22.890
They would carry the bodies
from here through the sewer and
dump them in the canal.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.529
In the canal!

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:29.797
They...
they thought of everything...

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.232
David, stop it, stop it!

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:31.699
Stop it...
look at me!

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.906
Did you kill Alice?

01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:46.047
just say you didn't do it...
look me in the eye

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.383
Say you didn't do it.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:48.716
Say you didn't do it, please!

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:52.720
Just tell me!

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.022
Whatever you say, I'll believe
you.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.059
Whatever you say, anything you
say, I'll believe you.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.399
I'll believe you...

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.800
I'll believe you...

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.435
Just tell me...

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.175
just tell me...

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:14.809
just tell me...

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.930
Just watch this.

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.166
Then you'll understand.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.100
Yeah, we'll...
we'll watch this.

01:20:59.922 --> 01:21:01.356
Ok there she is...
do you see her?

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:01.856
She's moving...

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.259
you see?

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:08.830
David...

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.968
there's nothing there.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.437
Just wait...
there's more.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.243
Ok... there...
there!

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:22.343
Do you see, there, look!

01:21:23.779 --> 01:21:24.078
What is that there?

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:26.481
She's moving toward us,
do you see her?

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.352
What is it?

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.226
Yes...
I see som...

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.694
You see it??

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:39.961
I see something

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:42.330
I told you I'm telling the
truth..

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:42.964
What is it??

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:46.334
I'm not going insane!

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:47.402
Do you understand me...

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.603
look there!

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:50.071
What is it??

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:56.411
David...

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.645
David, turn it off!

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:58.246
Turn it off, what is it??

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:01.549
What is it??

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:09.223
David please!!
No!!

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:17.198
Nooo!!!!

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:22.603
Stop!!!

01:22:24.006 --> 01:22:26.240
Arrrrghhhh!!!

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:40.755
What's up then?

01:22:42.224 --> 01:22:43.624
It wasn't me.

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:48.629
We saw him go into the house
with a woman, then we heard her
screaming. What have you done, David?

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:49.063
What have you done?

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:53.768
I didn't do it!

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:59.240
Open the door, David!

01:22:59.241 --> 01:22:59.907
Mr Williams...

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:01.342
David!
Open the door!

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.443
Open the fucking door, David.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:17.558
Upstairs!

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:22.597
David!

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.031
Come back!

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:25.166
Stop!

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:26.934
David!

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:30.838
Stop it...
stop it...

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:35.042
Look at me..

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:44.952
look!
Right, there she is.

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:46.320
There!
She's moving.

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:48.923
David..

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.325
there's nothing there..

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:53.828
There..
she's moving towards us...

01:23:53.829 --> 01:23:54.328
DO YOU SEE HER??

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:56.731
Look!

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:57.732
I want you to see her.

01:23:57.733 --> 01:23:59.166
You can see her!!

01:23:59.167 --> 01:23:59.367
There's nothing there!!

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:23.591
Go that way!!

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:37.471
The master wants her.

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:40.508
Give her to him.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.260
I couldn't help it..

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:01.262
You're a fucking whore!

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.663
David, I love you!

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.231
You're a fucking whore!

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:05.633
That's what you are!

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.301
I didn't mean for this to
happen.

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:09.070
I need to leave, I need to
take Billy with me..

01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:10.538
..No no, David, I'm sorry...

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.242
No no....

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:16.644
Fucking bitch!

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.414
David...

01:25:23.752 --> 01:25:26.220
No, David!!

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.621
Da...

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.023
David!!

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:30.424
David!!!

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:31.826
Euurgh!!

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:33.227
DAVID!!!

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.628
Hellp!

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.063
David!

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:39.900
Aghh!

01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:04.558
Alice...

01:26:07.963 --> 01:26:10.031
Alice...

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.551
David....

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:34.422
Aggghhhh!!

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:40.728
Arrrgghhh!

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:42.129
Arrrggghhhh!!

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:16.430
Arrrgghhh!

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.280
You alright?

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.064
When's the first viewing,
then?

01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:51.866
Next Monday.

01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:55.636
Will that give you enough
time? Oh yes yes,

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.404
the house will be cleared
by next Friday. I don't want time wasters.

01:27:57.405 --> 01:28:00.040
I only want serious people
looking at this house.

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:00.474
Of course.
I feel the same.

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:07.381
Nana, can I go inside and get
my dinosaur book?

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:08.282
Yes, yes - don't be long,
we're going now.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:15.723
I have a list of appointments
already lined up for next week.

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:41.348
Billy...

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:41.615
Billy, over here!

01:28:44.186 --> 01:28:45.452
It's Daddy...

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.827
I'm here with your mother.

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:57.198
Do you miss us?

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:06.140
Do you want to stay here with
us?

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.251
Do you want to stay here with
us forever?

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:20.654
I love you Billy.

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:24.291
I love you.
