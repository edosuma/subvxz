00:08.660 --> 00:10.184
Oh, hey, guys.

00:10.314 --> 00:11.837
Oh, thanks for coming
to Gemma's teachers mixer.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.579
Yeah, of course.
You know we're happy to support.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.668
[chuckles]: Come on, Dave.
We're like family, man.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.279
Plus, Tina told me

00:18.409 --> 00:20.324
you had an open bar.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.847
Good, you guys are here.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.198
You have to meet Alexis.

00:24.328 --> 00:27.244
I just hired her to teach
Black history. Now my school's

00:27.375 --> 00:29.812
on its way to having
its most diverse staff in years.Hmm.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.466
With this group?

00:32.684 --> 00:36.123
By "diverse," she must mean
in height and age.Mm-hmm.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.690
She has three degrees,

00:38.821 --> 00:41.693
speaks
multiple African languages,

00:41.824 --> 00:44.392
and Sasha Obama
follows her on Twitter.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.829
[chuckles]

00:46.959 --> 00:49.701
TINA: Hmm.You are gonna love Alexis.

00:49.832 --> 00:52.095
You know, she has already taught
me so much about Black history.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.837
TINA: Ah.Did you know that one in four
cowboys were Black?

00:54.967 --> 00:57.361
No, Dave,
I think it's more than that.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.494
I mean, you got Deion Sanders,

00:59.624 --> 01:01.104
uh, Emmitt Smith,
Michael Irvin.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.019
That's just the '90s.
What are you talking about?

01:03.150 --> 01:04.890
[Tina chuckles]Come on,
I'll introduce you.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.762
Oh.Excuse me, Alexis?

01:06.892 --> 01:09.243
These are our good
friends Calvin and Tina.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.683
Oh, nice to meet you,
my brother.

01:14.813 --> 01:17.468
Mm. Nice to meet you...

01:17.599 --> 01:18.991
m-my sister.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.342
Hi.[chuckling]

01:21.472 --> 01:23.170
Oh! Okay.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.911
We're hugging. [chuckles]
Ooh, you're strong.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.827
[chuckles]Look at you.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.482
Nyeusi ni nzuri.

01:31.613 --> 01:32.614
Oh.It's Swahili. It means

01:32.744 --> 01:34.572
"Black is beautiful."

01:34.703 --> 01:36.922
Well, to you, I say,

01:37.053 --> 01:39.490
"Ezekiel Elliott."

01:39.621 --> 01:40.839
Another Cowboy.

01:41.971 --> 01:44.669
Peace out, y'all.

01:48.804 --> 01:49.892
[door closes]

01:51.067 --> 01:53.069
Oh, my God.
Isn't she great?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.506
Yeah, yeah, really great.
But there's just one problem.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.725
She ain't Black.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.901
Huh?What?

01:59.031 --> 02:01.773
Oh, yeah, trust me. That girl is
as white as the cast of Friends.

welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:05.560 --> 02:05.908

02:11.827 --> 02:14.830
Tina, what do you mean
Alexis isn't Black?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.353
You're the one who told me
that Black people

02:16.484 --> 02:17.963
come in all shades
and colors.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.922
We do. But there's
just something

02:20.052 --> 02:21.967
that doesn't feel
right about her.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.405
My Blackdar is going off.

02:25.928 --> 02:28.800
You know, I hate
to disagree with you, Tina,

02:28.931 --> 02:30.889
but my Blackdar
says she is legit.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.415
But, of course, I defer to you.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.549
Come on, guys.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.943
What's the worst that can happen
if this teacher's not Black?

02:41.073 --> 02:43.946
The kids clapping offbeat
in the school musical?

02:45.774 --> 02:46.775
Well, if she's not,

02:46.905 --> 02:48.646
then she lied
on her application.

02:48.777 --> 02:51.345
And even worse,
this job came from a grant

02:51.475 --> 02:53.825
designated
for an African American teacher.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.959
The whole program could be
in jeopardy if I got this wrong.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.788
Okay, well,
why don't you just ask Alexis

02:59.918 --> 03:01.746
if she's Black or not.Yeah.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.748
Legally, I can't.[Dave exhales]

03:03.879 --> 03:06.055
Wouldn't it be nice

03:06.186 --> 03:07.926
if there was a neighbor who...

03:09.189 --> 03:10.886
...had the complexion...

03:13.018 --> 03:15.804
...to make the connection.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.589
Real subtle, Dave.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.941
All right. All right,
fine, I'll do it.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.814
[exhales]Just invite Alexis over
for dinner,

03:25.944 --> 03:27.032
and we'll figure out
if she's Black or not.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.773
Oh, thank you!
Thank you, Tina.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.647
You know, this is like
the Mariah Carey debate

03:32.777 --> 03:33.909
all over again.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.085
Yes, no. Yes, no. Yes.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.435
By the way,
where did we land on that?

03:42.178 --> 03:43.353
Before you say anything,

03:43.484 --> 03:46.095
we are just here
for the free food.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.619
See, that's the problem
with you two

03:48.750 --> 03:50.839
living within smell distance
of my house.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.624
Mm.Oh, hey,

03:53.755 --> 03:54.843
have you guys
heard the rumor

03:54.973 --> 03:56.366
that they're
building a Starbucks

03:56.497 --> 03:58.107
on the old baseball field?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.022
The baseball field
where I taught Malcolm to play?

04:00.152 --> 04:02.938
Yeah. Mom, now we can walk

04:03.068 --> 04:04.983
to get our pumpkin
spice lattes.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.856
Mmm. God is good.
[chuckles]

04:07.986 --> 04:11.163
Yes, He is.
But I'm sure He prefers baseball

04:11.294 --> 04:13.862
over your little, fancy coffees.

04:13.992 --> 04:17.082
Come on,
they can't tear that field down.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.867
It means too much
to the community.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.783
I got to try to do something
to save it.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.351
Well, what are you gonna do,
move into the dugout in protest

04:24.481 --> 04:26.483
or lay out
in front of the bulldozers?

04:27.745 --> 04:29.051
It's a local field,

04:29.181 --> 04:31.271
Tina, not Dodger Stadium.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.143
I'm gonna go talk to the mayor.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.972
He owes me a favor.
Come on, Mal.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.714
What? Why do I have to go?
[scoffs] Done with baseball.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.673
A-And besides, no one's used
that field in ten years.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.676
And you haven't paid
for food in ten years.

04:45.807 --> 04:46.895
Let's go.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.077
All right, guys. Look,

04:55.207 --> 04:57.297
we got to convince the mayor
to save this field.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.603
Does everybody remember
their parts?

04:59.734 --> 05:00.865
I do.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.780
When you say,
"What about the children?"

05:02.911 --> 05:04.521
I start crying.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.176
You're raising
a fine young man, Dave.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.831
Okay, here comes the mayor.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.835
Thank you so much for meeting
us. We appreciate it.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.011
Always happy to meet
with my constituents.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.665
Especially one that saw me

05:17.795 --> 05:19.231
at the gas station
doing something.

05:20.276 --> 05:21.495
Allegedly.[Calvin chuckles]

05:23.758 --> 05:25.499
Well, you know, Mayor,

05:25.629 --> 05:27.022
if you forget
about putting a Starbucks

05:27.152 --> 05:30.634
out here,
then maybe I could forget

05:30.765 --> 05:33.855
about you getting premium
at pump two without a car.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.161
What do you want?

05:36.292 --> 05:39.991
This field used to be the heart
and soul of this neighborhood.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.472
What if we clean this place up

05:42.603 --> 05:44.605
and get the youth baseball
league going again.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.084
We can have sponsors
to cover the cost.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.782
You know, Calvin's shop
will put in some money.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.392
I-I will?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.569
Yeah. Oh, I will

05:52.700 --> 05:54.528
if it will keep kids
off the streets.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.096
Kids off the streets.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.055
Oh.
[clears throat]

06:00.185 --> 06:02.884
This field kept me
from joining a gang

06:03.014 --> 06:04.276
and doing the drugs.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.195
I don't know.

Think about the children.

Oh, you know, it's-it's
okay. It's okay, buddy.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.641
Look, you may never achieve
your baseball dreams,

06:20.771 --> 06:24.122
but you are gonna get
what every kid wants:

06:24.253 --> 06:26.473
a half-caf macchiato.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.867
Come on, Mayor.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.566
Now, I know you don't want
to see this cute little kid

06:32.696 --> 06:34.742
crying
in the Pasadena Star-News.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.005
[crying]

06:37.135 --> 06:39.007
All right! All right.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.574
You get the team
up and running,

06:40.704 --> 06:41.749
and I'll convince
the city council.

06:41.879 --> 06:42.837
Thank you.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.797
So, me and Marty know
how we're gonna figure out

06:46.928 --> 06:48.756
if Alexis is legit or not.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.453
Yeah, we're gonna play trivia

06:50.584 --> 06:52.368
and ask her things
only Black folks would know.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.938
Okay, guys, I don't know that
that's exactly a foolproof plan.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.722
I mean, after spending
so much time with Calvin,

06:58.853 --> 06:59.897
I'd probably win.

all right? We got this.

you don't mind,

some potato salad.

Mmm. Homemade

raised me better than that.

Fantastic.

or pecans in this,

it is on point

that you're exposing our boys
to baseball.
