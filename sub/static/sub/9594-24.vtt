WEBVTT

00:25.226 --> 00:26.394
Gonna eat,
gonna eat,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.296
gonna eat some food!

00:28.329 --> 00:30.764
Oh, box pasta.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.433
Fancy.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.270
Boil water. Stir occasionally.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.838
Come on!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.707
Too much work for this, dude.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.712
Yo, Rave,
can you change the channel?

00:46.847 --> 00:49.117
You change it,
remote's closer to you.

00:52.120 --> 00:52.920
Oh!

00:56.790 --> 00:58.492
No, never mind.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.528
I'll change it
the old fashioned way.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.533
Well, that didn't work at all.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.368
Started a small fire too.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.305
Shall we extinguish
the flames?

01:11.339 --> 01:12.873
Nah,
just call the Fire Department.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.844
But you are in closer
proximity to the phone
than am I.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.713
Ah, no.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.748
Well, we tried.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.583
Ahhh!

01:22.616 --> 01:23.851
Fire!

01:26.520 --> 01:27.721
Water Punch now!

01:27.755 --> 01:30.191
Extinguishing Kick!

01:32.460 --> 01:34.762
Titans, this is the fourth
fire this week,

01:34.795 --> 01:37.231
I've had to put out
with my sweet ninja moves.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.468
Oh, thanks, man.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.869
Could you also change
the channel?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.438
And fix the TV.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.507
What is up
with this team lately?

01:46.540 --> 01:48.376
Being a super hero is hard.

01:48.409 --> 01:52.546
Sometimes, a period
of the vegetableling out
is most necessary.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.617
Looks like your rest
and relaxation is over,
Titans.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.787
Brother Blood has kidnapped
the City Council.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.255
Titans, go!

02:02.256 --> 02:03.357
Oh!

02:03.391 --> 02:04.858
Do we have to?

02:04.892 --> 02:08.596
Yeah, I really don't feel
like teleporting instantly
across the entire city.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.765
Fine, since you're all lazy
and unprepared anyway,

02:11.799 --> 02:13.767
I'll just take my other team!

02:14.702 --> 02:16.504
What is this other team?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.372
Oh, you don't know
about my other team.

02:18.406 --> 02:21.275
Well, maybe a little birdie
can tell you all about it.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.158
Hello.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.795
Dude, what was...

02:43.431 --> 02:44.498
Ah!

02:44.532 --> 02:47.301
Team Titans meet Team Robin!

02:48.636 --> 02:50.504
-This is Robin.
-Hi there.

02:50.538 --> 02:51.839
-ROBIN: Robin.
-Well, hello.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.208
-And finally, Robin.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.710
Whoa!
There are three other Robins?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.412
Oh, there have been
more than that.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.615
And golly, our chum Batman
does go through
a side kick or two.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.284
But, we're the best
of the best.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.452
That's right, Robin.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.621
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have a City Council
to save.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.889
Robins, go!

03:10.958 --> 03:11.959
Ahhh!

03:11.992 --> 03:13.461
Mission complete!

03:13.494 --> 03:14.662
Nice work, Robin.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.963
Couldn't have done it
without you, Robin.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.998
Golly, Robin,
you were amazing!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.600
But did you see
Robin out there?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.402
Robin really robined
the Robins.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.671
When I saw Robin,
Robin the Robin, I robined.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.806
TEAM ROBIN: Robin. Robin.
Robin. Robin. Robin.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.875
Team Robin. Caw! Caw!

03:27.908 --> 03:30.478
Dude, they just did our job
for us!

03:30.511 --> 03:32.680
And with great speed
and efficiency.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.582
Of course they did,
they're all Robins.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.450
They always have to be
the best.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.286
Hmm...

03:40.488 --> 03:42.423
Guys, this might shock you,

03:42.456 --> 03:43.724
but I have an idea.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.461
ROBIN: Ahem!

03:47.495 --> 03:52.032
I hope seeing us in action
has inspired you all
to try harder.

03:52.065 --> 03:52.800
Totally!

03:52.833 --> 03:54.935
We learned our lesson.
Thanks, Rob.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.439
Always happy to show
what true heroism looks like.

03:58.472 --> 04:02.443
Oh, sorry, I was talking
to the other Robin.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.744
The one who did all the work.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.280
Thanks, glad someone sees
who the real hero is here.

04:06.314 --> 04:09.350
Not you, Robin,
the best Robin.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.252
The one
with the smooth hairless legs.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.954
Thank you.

04:13.987 --> 04:17.525
Guys,
I'm Robin Classic, the best!

04:17.558 --> 04:18.859
Care to test that theory?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.361
Come on guys,
we all know I'm the best.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.396
There's no way
I'm not the best Robin.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.765
Clearly I'm the best,
at least the toughest.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.266
-Ahhh!
-Whoa!

04:26.867 --> 04:28.902
Argh!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.237
Come on, guys,
you all better recognize...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.740
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
This is the OG Robin.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.577
Now, obviously,

04:36.610 --> 04:37.845
the best Robin
is the strongest,

04:37.878 --> 04:39.913
the quickest,
the most capable, right?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.516
So, for instance,

04:42.550 --> 04:45.686
the Robin who could get pizza
the fastest...

04:45.719 --> 04:46.987
Getting pizza?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.922
-How is that going to be...
-It's going to be me!

04:48.956 --> 04:50.023
-Hold on.
-No, wait.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.393
That wasn't very sporting
at all.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.727
I feel the guilt.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.729
Should we not be doing
our own work?

04:55.763 --> 04:58.065
No way,
it's like the old saying,

04:58.098 --> 05:00.934
"Always trick your friends
into doing things
for you and stuff."

05:00.968 --> 05:02.636
-Why, yes,
I do recall the saying.
-Oh, yeah.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.572
-Of course.
I remember that one.
-My dad used to say that.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.975
I won!

05:08.008 --> 05:10.811
-I got the pizza first.
-Thanks, Robin.
You're the best!

05:10.844 --> 05:13.347
-I know.
-Oh no, not you, Robin, Robin.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.984
-Oh, golly.
-Robin already got us a pizza
and fixed the TV.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.354
But, it's not hard
when you put your mind to it.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.590
-Beast Boy,

05:22.623 --> 05:23.791
do you need help?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.496
No, Robin, I'm cool.
Robin has it covered.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.464
Now chew please, Robin.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.469
You, Robin,
are a rocking Robin, Robin.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.504
CYBORG: Hey, Robin!

05:39.540 --> 05:42.776
Look at this cool outfit
Robin made for me.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.878
It draws attention
to the quads and calves,

05:44.912 --> 05:47.515
just like a costume should.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.883
Gotta step up your game,
Robin, if you wanna compete.

05:49.917 --> 05:53.086
Oh,
I've never been so relaxed.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.489
Deep breaths,
let all the tension out.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.790
Breaking knuckle punch!

05:56.824 --> 05:58.392
Deep tissue karate chop!

05:58.426 --> 05:59.460
Argh!

05:59.493 --> 06:00.861
Sugar, please.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.731
-It's so snug.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.399
It's got that snap I like.

06:05.433 --> 06:09.837
Yes, Robin,
your fingers are like
tiny magic claw bones...

06:09.870 --> 06:12.540
-Claw bones...

06:12.940 --> 06:13.974
That's it!

06:14.007 --> 06:17.445
Every Robin who's not Robin,
out!

06:20.481 --> 06:21.949
No!

06:21.982 --> 06:24.151
They were so helpful.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.153
How am I gonna eat now?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.021
The same way you used to!

06:28.055 --> 06:31.559
I don't remember how!

06:31.592 --> 06:34.495
Am... Am I doing it?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.833
Brother Blood's back!

06:39.867 --> 06:41.635
But, the other Robins
are all gone.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.770
Who's gonna fight 'em?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.204
Us, obviously!

06:44.237 --> 06:47.074
I know you're all feeling
sluggish, but that's okay.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.009
I will lead you to victory.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.044
We will defeat Brother Blood

06:51.078 --> 06:55.415
and prove once and for all
that I am the best Robin.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.518
How did we get captured?

06:57.551 --> 07:01.755
Seriously, I had a whole
elaborate trap and everything!

07:01.789 --> 07:03.056
Oh well, time to die.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.195
Ahhh!

07:22.576 --> 07:25.646
I know, I know,
I wish they were faster too.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.181
Now, I'm going to check on
a few things around the lair.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.818
Just keep screaming.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.285
Ahhh!

07:32.319 --> 07:37.658
Well, since we have
some time, is there something
you'd like to say to me.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.794
Okay fine, maybe we were
getting a little lazy.

07:40.828 --> 07:41.995
We're sorry.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.532
We will train most vigorously
in the future.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.234
Now call your Robin buds
and let's get outta here.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.903
No way! The best Robin
doesn't need help.

07:49.937 --> 07:50.971
I'll save us!

07:51.004 --> 07:52.673
If I struggle enough,

07:52.706 --> 07:55.108
I'll lose weight, then,
I'll be able to slip
out of the ropes.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.546
Nice work, best Robin!

08:00.180 --> 08:01.715
Getting a little sweat going.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.585
-Just call the other Robins.
-Nope!

08:04.618 --> 08:06.520
Come on, make that bird sound.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.021
Don't need to.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.123
Fine, I'm just going to call
them myself.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.295
That's not it, dude.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.599
It's like...

08:18.632 --> 08:20.267
Just stop, they're not coming!

08:20.300 --> 08:23.170
The pounds are melting off.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.939
I believe
it was more of the...

08:27.908 --> 08:29.877
No, come on, it was...

08:30.611 --> 08:31.612
Caw.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.985
Oh, no, no. You're not going
to get them to come that way.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.888
It's actually...

08:47.194 --> 08:48.862
Wait! No, no, no, stop!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.598
I take it back!

08:52.800 --> 08:54.167
Holy hostages, Robin!

08:54.201 --> 08:56.003
Looks like
you could use some help.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.771
-Yes!
-No!

08:57.805 --> 08:58.772
Just checking in.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.241
Your deaths,
are they imminent yet?

09:01.274 --> 09:03.343
Robin! Robin! Robin!

09:03.376 --> 09:06.980
Robin! Robin! Robin! Robin!
Robin!

09:07.014 --> 09:08.649
Robin! Robin!

09:08.682 --> 09:09.717
Robins!

09:13.020 --> 09:14.187
Attack!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.059
No!

09:23.964 --> 09:25.332
Hurt Bot!

09:25.365 --> 09:28.068
Must show Robin
who the best Robin is.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.302
Robins, go!

09:33.206 --> 09:34.942
Uh, the death circle
isn't built

09:34.975 --> 09:37.110
for this many people.
So I need you all
to squeeze together, okay?

09:37.144 --> 09:40.313
Otherwise, I'm going
to have to run it twice
and that is just a hassle.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.316
Guys, if this is it,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.385
I just want you all to know,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.921
since these losers failed,

09:47.955 --> 09:51.358
this means I'm back
in the running
for "Best Robin"!

09:51.391 --> 09:54.227
-Yes!
-You were captured first.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.263
Look, you each
have different strengths.

09:56.296 --> 10:00.934
Robin may be best at combat
but he doesn't have
Robin's toned muscular thighs.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.804
Why, thank you.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.740
And only one Robin is the best
at the foot rubs.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.276
Toes are the key
to the perfect massage.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.346
They're right.
There's no way to truly tell
who's the best Robin.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.816
We should just be okay
being ourselves.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.654
Especially since
we'll all be dead soon.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.055
Ahhh!

10:33.200 --> 10:35.268
Curse you, Super Robin.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.840
All right!
That's the Best Robin!
