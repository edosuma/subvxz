- Oh, thanks.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.079
I -- is this you and Megan?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.014
Yeah, and Jenny.

19:44.296 --> 19:46.312
Ah, you guys are so young.

19:46.829 --> 19:49.564
Does Jenny still have a cottage
around here too?

19:49.727 --> 19:52.190
No. No, Jenny passed away.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:56.141 --> 20:00.744
Uh, just about two weeks after
that photo was taken actually.

20:02.567 --> 20:03.667
Jesus.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.337
Quite the endurance test,
isn't it?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.859
Yeah, it's deceiving,
that's for sure.

20:09.932 --> 20:10.932
Yeah.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.524
I'll be right down. Sorry.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.613
Okay.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.223
- Julie, right?
- Yeah.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.691
- Daniel.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

20:26.757 --> 20:28.224
Nice to meet you.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.262
- Red or white?
- Water is good. Thank you.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.097
Sorry, I just want
to straighten this up

20:33.132 --> 20:36.500
but did, did Megan not tell you
anything about Jenny?

20:37.837 --> 20:41.505
Uh... no. Never.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.842
Why? What is it?

20:46.303 --> 20:47.437
Well..

20:48.805 --> 20:51.482
I guess it's a little bit
strange, don't you think?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.884
I mean, that was
a really big deal for us.

20:58.214 --> 21:02.249

another glass of wine.</i>

21:12.905 --> 21:14.772
Uh, yeah, just,
just for the weekend.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.234
It's our, uh...
one year anniversary.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.211

Is everything okay?

22:07.090 --> 22:08.389
Yeah.

22:09.278 --> 22:11.124
You're not a good liar, Jules.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.865
You haven't said more
than a few words to me all day.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.042
Why didn't you tell me
about Jenny?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.447
Your childhood friend.

22:30.925 --> 22:34.861
Sarah, she made it sound like
you had something to do --

22:34.921 --> 22:36.352
Wait. Wait.

22:37.446 --> 22:40.447
- You saw Sarah?
- And her husband Daniel.

22:41.061 --> 22:42.093
Yeah.

22:42.702 --> 22:44.168
Yesterday.

23:07.535 --> 23:10.234
Sarah, Jenny and I..

23:13.367 --> 23:16.109
...we used to swim out
into the lake.

23:17.362 --> 23:19.796
We would try to race across
to the other side.

23:20.063 --> 23:23.789
<i>[chuckles]
We were just stupid and young.</i>

23:24.416 --> 23:26.716
<i>One summer, Jenny challenged me.</i>

23:28.550 --> 23:30.774
I was about half way across..

23:34.999 --> 23:37.232
And I started cramping up,
so I..

23:38.136 --> 23:39.539
...I stopped.

23:41.535 --> 23:44.570
<i>I looked around to see
where she was..</i>

23:45.978 --> 23:49.212
...and I, I couldn't find her.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.504
[sobbing]

24:02.680 --> 24:06.368
The search and rescue pulled
her body out of the lake..

24:07.197 --> 24:08.897
...two days later.

24:10.593 --> 24:12.426
<i>And the police questioned me.</i>

24:13.565 --> 24:15.524
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.

24:22.297 --> 24:24.078
[sighs]

24:24.350 --> 24:27.125
I would never have done
anything to hurt Jenny.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.719
She was my...

24:30.885 --> 24:32.984
my best friend.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.124
Hey.

24:38.187 --> 24:39.753
Hey.

24:48.463 --> 24:50.414
Do you really think that I..

24:51.133 --> 24:55.024
No, no, no. I don't know..

24:55.643 --> 24:57.242
I don't know what I thought.

24:59.978 --> 25:01.277
Come here.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.638
I guess I probably shouldn't
have invited them over

25:07.673 --> 25:09.414
for dinner on Sunday.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.695
[laughs]
No, you didn't.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.109
I did.

25:15.008 --> 25:17.114
Okay, you're cooking.

25:17.172 --> 25:18.772
- No way!
- Yeah.

25:27.751 --> 25:30.051
I used to be really good,
you know.

25:30.087 --> 25:32.087

on my team.

25:51.828 --> 25:53.851

Don't you even dare, Jules.

We'll work this out.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.512

Now, don't move.

45:27.559 --> 45:30.160
[whispering]
Why are you doing this?

45:30.195 --> 45:32.495
What, what the hell
is wrong with you?

45:32.530 --> 45:35.031
We're not doing this
right now, Jules.

45:38.403 --> 45:39.969
What the hell is wrong with you?

We're not doing
this right now, Jules!

Everything okay, ladies?

45:52.350 --> 45:53.649
You alright?

If you say even one word

We're okay!

Jules just got a bit cramped up

46:13.438 --> 46:17.540
so we're gonna, we're gonna
turn this boat back to shore!

46:17.575 --> 46:20.243
Wow, trying to make the trip
again, huh, Jules?

46:20.278 --> 46:22.312
It's impressive!

46:22.347 --> 46:24.814
<i>Alright, well, we'll see you
tomorrow night then!</i>

46:24.849 --> 46:27.350
A -- actually you know what?

Tomorrow is not looking
so good for us.

Tonight is!

Uh, yeah.

Okay, th -- that works better
actually.

Uh, 8:00 p.m.

Yeah, that's great!

Okay, well,
uh, we'll see you then!

[Jules sobbing]

47:14.032 --> 47:15.698

[Jules whimpering]

47:20.138 --> 47:21.304
<i>How much?</i>

47:22.440 --> 47:24.607
<i>Well, you should know that,
Jules.</i>

47:24.642 --> 47:26.709
<i>You're the one
that signed the policy.</i>

47:38.389 --> 47:40.389
Did you ever love me?

47:42.360 --> 47:43.360
No.

<i>I saw right through you
from the second</i>

47:48.833 --> 47:50.633
<i>I laid my eyes on you.</i>

47:50.668 --> 47:53.203
You're not gonna get away
with this.

47:53.238 --> 47:55.104
As soon as they get here

47:55.139 --> 47:58.641
I am going to scream
so goddamn loud.

47:58.676 --> 48:01.511
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

48:01.546 --> 48:04.147
I'm gonna tell them exactly..

48:04.182 --> 48:06.182
[muffled scream]

[sighs]

48:23.801 --> 48:26.736
Jules? Jules?

48:26.771 --> 48:29.272
Jules, if you give
even the slightest indication

48:29.307 --> 48:31.641
that something is wrong

48:31.676 --> 48:33.676
I'm gonna take this knife
and I'm gonna stick it

48:33.711 --> 48:35.311
right into Sarah's chest.

48:35.346 --> 48:36.813
Right here.

48:36.848 --> 48:40.116
Right into her solar plexus

48:40.151 --> 48:44.287
and drag it all the way down
to her stomach

48:44.322 --> 48:46.022
before ripping it out

48:46.057 --> 48:48.624
along with everything else
that comes with it.

48:51.162 --> 48:52.728
Do you understand?

49:09.514 --> 49:11.514
[fire crackling]

49:22.126 --> 49:23.926
Your story..

49:26.464 --> 49:27.997
What your dad said..

49:31.402 --> 49:34.136
To only kill..

49:35.239 --> 49:37.239
...what keeps you alive.

49:41.412 --> 49:43.279
This isn't what he meant.

49:48.886 --> 49:51.587
You're sick, Jackie.

49:54.392 --> 49:56.492
But I can get you help.

49:59.630 --> 50:02.631
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

50:21.919 --> 50:23.486
It's okay.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.726
It's not easy to admit.

50:29.761 --> 50:31.761
I understand.

50:37.602 --> 50:39.769
But I'll stay by your side.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.107
I will.

50:44.142 --> 50:46.042
Please, Jackie.

50:47.612 --> 50:49.445
I'll let it go.

50:50.581 --> 50:52.314
All of it.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.185
We can just get in the car
and drive

50:56.220 --> 50:58.821
and get as far away
from this place as possible..

50:59.524 --> 51:01.390
...before they show up.

51:02.126 --> 51:03.325
Please.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.331
I never told you
about my first wife, did I?

51:11.402 --> 51:12.601
Erica.

51:14.839 --> 51:17.106
We got married
when I was only 19.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.910
I guess it slipped my mind
until now.

51:23.748 --> 51:26.749
[dramatic music]

51:37.662 --> 51:39.028
[groaning]

51:47.004 --> 51:48.304
How?

51:51.509 --> 51:53.642
We were on vacation.

51:55.179 --> 51:56.579
She went swimming

51:56.614 --> 51:58.848
after having a few too many.

52:00.051 --> 52:01.617
I mourned her.

52:03.354 --> 52:04.954
Prayed with her parents.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.256
Read at her funeral.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.661
I'll do the same at yours.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.235
I know what you're trying to do,
Jules.

52:20.538 --> 52:23.038
And this little game
that you're playing right now..

52:24.876 --> 52:26.175
...won't work.

52:28.980 --> 52:31.347
How much was she worth?

52:32.783 --> 52:35.784
[inhales]

52:36.888 --> 52:38.721
She was priceless.

52:43.861 --> 52:46.696
I never thought I would be
having dinner with Megan again.

52:46.731 --> 52:47.964
Just breathe, baby

52:47.999 --> 52:49.665
and just be nice.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.200
It'll be over
before you know it.

52:51.235 --> 52:52.602
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

52:52.637 --> 52:53.702
Um..

52:54.572 --> 52:56.205
- Hi!
- Hey!

52:56.240 --> 52:57.707
So glad you guys could make it!

52:57.742 --> 52:59.142
- <i>Yeah! Thank you!</i>
- Come in, come in.

52:59.177 --> 53:01.043
Don't worry about your shoes,
just make yourself at home.

53:01.078 --> 53:04.080
Wow! Megan,
it is crazy to be back here.

53:04.115 --> 53:05.314
- It's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.749
It's been a,
it's been a while for you.

53:06.784 --> 53:08.017
- That's for sure.
- Yeah.

53:08.052 --> 53:09.385
We brought a nice bottle
of wine.

53:09.420 --> 53:10.586
Oh, great!
Uh, yeah, follow me.

53:10.621 --> 53:11.654
The glasses
are in the kitchen here.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.556
Great! Open up
a nice bottle of wine.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.658
<i>Yes, let's.</i>

53:16.994 --> 53:18.828
- Thanks.
- <i>Jules!</i>

53:18.863 --> 53:20.696
Oh, it's so nice
to see you again.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.201
Are you okay?

53:25.236 --> 53:27.102
Yeah, I -- I'm fine.

53:28.539 --> 53:31.941
Did you, uh, strain yourself
with all the paddling, Jules?

53:34.278 --> 53:35.744
Yeah, that's it.

53:36.647 --> 53:38.181
Nothing, a few painkillers

53:38.216 --> 53:39.582
and a shot of whiskey
won't cure.

53:39.617 --> 53:41.117
Well, I hear that!

53:41.152 --> 53:43.653
<i>Well, we, well,
we brought a bottle of wine</i>

53:43.688 --> 53:45.488
<i>would you like to come
have a glass?</i>

53:45.523 --> 53:46.789
Love to.

[indistinct chatter]

53:59.337 --> 54:02.204
<i>So, Jules,
when did you know about Megan?</i>

54:04.275 --> 54:06.575
<i>Julie? Julie?</i>

54:07.511 --> 54:09.679
Sorry, I -- I missed that.

54:09.714 --> 54:11.080
<i>Just..</i>

54:11.115 --> 54:13.115
I was asking when do you knew

54:13.150 --> 54:14.850
Megan was the one?

54:17.588 --> 54:19.788
Megan, uh..

54:21.025 --> 54:23.092
I don't know.

54:23.127 --> 54:25.728
Well, what I -- I think
she means to say

54:25.763 --> 54:27.162
is that..

54:27.999 --> 54:29.699
...it was love at first sight.

54:29.734 --> 54:31.000
[chuckles]

54:31.035 --> 54:32.801
Well, now that I want to hear.

54:34.705 --> 54:35.804
Uh..

54:37.308 --> 54:40.943
L -- love happened

54:40.978 --> 54:42.411
slowly for me.

54:43.914 --> 54:46.148
And then all at once.

54:46.183 --> 54:49.418
<i>You start to notice
all the little things.</i>

54:49.453 --> 54:51.220
<i>The good..</i>

54:51.255 --> 54:52.788
<i>...and the bad.</i>

54:53.924 --> 54:55.758
The way they blink a lot

54:55.793 --> 54:57.326
when they think hard.

54:58.763 --> 55:02.431
The way they laugh at jokes
that aren't funny.

55:02.466 --> 55:04.066
[chuckles]

55:04.101 --> 55:06.202
<i>And all the little nuances</i>

55:06.237 --> 55:08.804
that get under your skin.

55:08.839 --> 55:12.408
Like the way they,
uh, shower for too long

55:12.443 --> 55:15.577
or, or hog the blankets
at night, but..

55:17.014 --> 55:18.514
...but it's the way
they see the world

55:18.549 --> 55:21.083
differently than you that..

55:21.118 --> 55:22.885
...that really draws you in.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.787
See now that I get.

55:24.822 --> 55:26.656
And even though..

55:26.691 --> 55:28.624
...even though..

55:28.659 --> 55:30.025
...you can..

55:31.128 --> 55:32.261
...never really know

55:32.296 --> 55:34.296
<i>what's going on
inside their head.</i>

55:35.966 --> 55:37.232
<i>I mean..</i>

55:38.903 --> 55:41.303
...really know
what's going on inside.

55:43.441 --> 55:45.441
You take the leap anyway..

55:47.545 --> 55:48.777
...and..

55:50.114 --> 55:51.747
...you hope for the best.

55:56.387 --> 55:58.787
And you just pray
you don't get the worst.

56:07.932 --> 56:09.265
Of course..

56:09.300 --> 56:11.734
...with Megan,
I got really lucky.

56:12.303 --> 56:15.304
[laughing]

56:18.609 --> 56:19.642
That was good.

56:19.677 --> 56:21.077
[laughing]

56:21.112 --> 56:22.678
Well, if it's anything
like our marriage

56:22.713 --> 56:24.213
then I'm sure
she's the lucky one.

56:24.248 --> 56:26.349
Mm! Really,
I'm the lucky one?

56:26.384 --> 56:27.616
Oh!

[laughs]

56:29.653 --> 56:32.654
[instrumental music]

56:34.859 --> 56:36.592
Yeah.

56:36.627 --> 56:37.993
She strained herself
quite a bit today

56:38.028 --> 56:39.929
<i>she pushed herself too hard.</i>

56:39.964 --> 56:41.497
She's always overdoing it.

56:41.532 --> 56:43.733
So stubborn.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.868
My wife, don't tell her
I said it.

56:45.903 --> 56:47.636
She actually, she's a funny one.

56:47.671 --> 56:51.907
