02:40.730 --> 02:42.060
Liberty's moving.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.480
The 10:15 has been moved
to the Indian Treaty Room.

02:44.650 --> 02:49.280
- Ten-fifteen is American Fisheries?
- They're giving you a 200-pound halibut.

02:49.440 --> 02:53.860
Janie, make a note. We need more events
where somebody gives me a really big fish.

02:54.030 --> 02:55.820
- Yes, sir.
- Janie, I'm kidding.

02:55.990 --> 02:57.450
- Of course, sir.
- Hey, Cooper.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.370
Morning, Mr. President.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.830
Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
with you this morning, sir.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.330
Is he upset about the speech last night?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.630
He seemed concerned.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.960
Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
unless Lewis was concerned...

03:12.130 --> 03:14.260
...about something I did Sunday night.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.350
- You skipped the paragraph.
- And Monday morning, it is.

03:17.510 --> 03:20.890
"Americans can no longer afford to pretend
they live in a great society."

03:21.060 --> 03:23.810
And then nothing.
You dumped the handguns paragraph.

03:23.980 --> 03:25.980
This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

03:26.150 --> 03:28.150
But, sir, that was the kick-ass section.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.820
Well, I thought,
what with being president and all...

03:30.980 --> 03:34.820
- I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to imply...
- I thought you'd be turning cartwheels.

03:34.990 --> 03:36.530
Sixty-three percent job approval.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.700
- That is good news.
- Morning, Mr. President.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.410
- Charlie.
- Morning, Charlie.

03:40.830 --> 03:42.830
Sir, the press
is gonna need an explanation.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
- For what?
- You dumped the whole kick-ass section.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.630
Now we've just got this thing
hanging out there.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.170
There's this "thing"?

03:50.340 --> 03:53.510
"Americans can't afford to pretend
they live in a great society"...

03:53.670 --> 03:56.260
No explanation, no context,
just this thing.

03:56.430 --> 03:59.430
- And it's hanging out there.
- Yes, sir.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.720
- Maria.
- Morning, sir.

04:00.890 --> 04:04.180
- Did they tell you I'll need the consumer...
- Overall consumer spending.

04:04.350 --> 04:06.190
- We'll have it in 15 minutes.
- Thanks.

04:06.650 --> 04:11.150
- Mr. President, we need to focus on...
- Lewis, reduce your morning coffee by half.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.530
I don't drink coffee, sir.

04:12.690 --> 04:15.360
Hit yourself over the head
with a baseball bat, would you?

04:15.530 --> 04:17.200
- Yes, sir.
- Happy birthday, Laura.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.990
- Laura, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.240
- I should send her flowers.
- You did, sir.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.580
- Good.
- Good morning.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.160
- How are you today, Mrs. Chapil?
- Fine, thank you.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.120
Mr. Kodak left a detailed breakdown
of the approval poll for you.

04:28.290 --> 04:30.210
He seemed to indicate
that it was good news.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.460
Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

04:32.630 --> 04:36.300
Lucy called. You forgot to sign
her permission slip for her class.

04:36.550 --> 04:38.090
Uh, the museum trip. I'll get it.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.300
- What time's she getting home?
- Three-twenty.

04:40.470 --> 04:42.220
- How's my afternoon?
- Very crowded.

04:42.390 --> 04:44.060
Schedule some time at 3:45.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.350
Too Tall McCall. So how was Mexico?

04:48.520 --> 04:50.230
I didn't truly appreciate it...

04:50.400 --> 04:52.770
...till I discovered
that America isn't a great society.

04:53.070 --> 04:56.610
- He dumped the whole section.
- There's this, uh, thing hanging out there.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.070
Not a great society, sir?

04:58.240 --> 05:01.370
With you away it wasn't.
Now that you're back we're great again.

05:01.780 --> 05:04.620
Well, the press is saying,
"What did he mean by that?"

05:04.790 --> 05:06.370
A.J., did you get one of these?

05:06.790 --> 05:08.750
Is that the letter from Solomon
at the GDC?

05:08.920 --> 05:12.630
It's from the environmental community.
These people are out of control.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.210
Well, they're frustrated.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.710
Are they blaming the president
for global warming?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.550
Well, they don't think he caused it.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.970
I'm on the phone with them twice a week.
I honestly don't know what they want.

05:23.140 --> 05:25.810
They want a 20 percent reduction
in fossil-fuel emissions.

05:25.970 --> 05:28.810
- Won't pass at 20 percent.
- Well, we haven't really tried.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.850
Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
hold too many markers.

05:32.020 --> 05:33.980
If we try to push this through and lose...

05:34.150 --> 05:36.440
...there'll be a loud thud
when we hit the ground.

05:36.610 --> 05:38.690
That's not what you want
in an election year.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.570
Talk to GDC again, A.J.

05:40.740 --> 05:44.200
Tell them I resent the implication
I've turned my back on the environment.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.330
Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor...

05:46.500 --> 05:49.040
...but I'm gonna ask
for a 10 percent reduction.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.000
They wanna pull their support, fine.

05:51.170 --> 05:54.540
With a 63 percent job approval rating,
I don't need their help.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.840
- Good deal.
- All right, let's get going. Where's Leon?

05:58.010 --> 06:01.510
John, will you call Mr. Kodak
and tell him the president's waiting?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.050
Oh, sorry, my fault.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.350
Never mind, John.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.640
Excuse me.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.310
- Morning, Mr. President.
- You all right?

06:10.480 --> 06:12.350
They keep moving that big ficus plant.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.400
We're all here, Mr. President.

06:15.570 --> 06:18.610
Okay, first of all,
I wanted to say congratulations.

06:18.780 --> 06:22.570
Three years ago we were elected
by one of the narrowest margins in history.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.780
And today Kodak, here, tells us...

06:24.950 --> 06:27.910
...63 percent of registered voters
think we're doing a good job.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.330
Wait. You wanted me to poll
registered voters?

06:31.870 --> 06:34.210
The poll also tells us
what we already know:

06:34.380 --> 06:36.670
If we don't get our crime bill
through Congress...

06:36.840 --> 06:38.630
...those numbers are gonna be memory.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.170
So, starting today,
we're shifting it into gear.

06:41.340 --> 06:44.680
- Can I tell the press that gun control...
- Crime control, Robin.

06:44.850 --> 06:47.390
Gun control means we're wimps
and soft on crime.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
- Hang on.
- Lewis.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.730
We're not putting back
handgun restrictions?

06:50.890 --> 06:52.690
No. We're leaving them out.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.150
Mr. President,
we campaigned on this issue.

06:56.310 --> 06:59.730
We took them out in the low 40s,
but we could push it through now.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.690
After the elections, Lewis.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.490
We may never have
an opportunity like this again.

07:04.660 --> 07:08.280
Sir, let's take this 63 percent out for a spin.
Let's see what it could do.

07:08.450 --> 07:11.120
We can't take it for a spin.
We need it to get re-elected.

07:11.290 --> 07:15.460
For reasons passing understanding,
they don't relate guns to gun-related crime.

07:15.630 --> 07:18.590
Robin, you can brief the press
this afternoon. As of today...

07:18.750 --> 07:21.920
...the crime bill is priority one
on the president's domestic agenda.

07:22.090 --> 07:23.880
- Got it.
- Leon, you run the war room.

07:24.050 --> 07:27.550
We're gonna need detailed projections
for all the target districts.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.180
Oh, and, Leon, don't be the nice,
sweet guy from Brooklyn on this.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.600
Do what the NRA does.

07:32.770 --> 07:34.190
- Scare them?
- Exactly.

07:34.350 --> 07:35.440
I can do that, heh.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.230
Lewis, you're legislative liaison.
You're gonna run the show on the hill.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.320
Can I just say that it might be easier
to fight a war on drugs...

07:43.490 --> 07:47.570
...if we weren't arming drug dealers?
- We gotta fight the fights we can win.

07:47.740 --> 07:48.950
Yes, sir.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.830
We want to announce the crime bill...

07:50.990 --> 07:53.330
...at the State of the Union,
72 days from today.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.580
Last notice count put us 18 votes short.

07:55.750 --> 07:59.130
Eighteen votes in 72 days.
Thank you, everyone.

07:59.290 --> 08:00.960
- Thank you.
- Janie, what's next?

08:01.130 --> 08:02.960
Security briefing, sir.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.850
Morning, Global Defense Council.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.480
You wanted to see me?

08:14.640 --> 08:17.730
- I just got off the phone with A.J.
- The president read the letter?

08:17.900 --> 08:20.650
The president's pissed.
That letter was a stupid move.

08:20.820 --> 08:23.570
- We should stand by every word of it.
- This isn't the guy...

08:23.740 --> 08:26.990
...who needed our help four years ago.
He's incredibly popular.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.370
He's gonna win re-election.
He could give a shit what we stand by.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.000
If he passes the most important piece
of environmental legislation in history...

08:35.159 --> 08:38.620
...despite our negative endorsement,
our political weight in the future...

08:38.789 --> 08:41.710
...will rank somewhere below
the Save the Spotted Owl Society.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.970
I'm bringing in some help.

08:47.130 --> 08:50.470
Heh, we don't need another expert
to confirm what everyone already knows.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.050
Not an environmental expert.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.850
A professional political strategist.

08:55.060 --> 08:57.820
We are playing hardball with
Andrew Shepherd and we need a heavy bat.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.940
- Who?
- Sydney Ellen Wade.

09:01.110 --> 09:05.230
Gah, christ, she doesn't know the first
thing about the environmental lobby.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.400
She's a closer, Susan.
She gets the job done.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.570
What if I lose this?

09:10.740 --> 09:12.410
Then move this up here.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.030
Sasser from the Times called.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.330
Wanted to know what
a "great society" was.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
What'd you tell him?

09:17.660 --> 09:20.540
I can't speak for the president,
but for my money, Bermuda.

09:20.710 --> 09:21.710
Perfect.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.460
Your cousin Judith got the flu and
won't be able to join you Thursday night.

09:25.630 --> 09:28.010
I'm sorry to hear that.
Remind me to call her later.

09:28.180 --> 09:29.180
Yes, sir.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.090
- You're gonna go stag?
- Not a problem.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.720
No, we've never gone wrong parading
you around as the lonely widower.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.770
I can't believe I said that.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.190
That was a thoughtless remark.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.320
I wouldn't never dream of insulting you
or your wife's memory.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.900
That's okay. Forget it. What time is it?

09:49.860 --> 09:50.990
It's 3:30, sir.

09:51.530 --> 09:53.490
I'm gonna go up and say hi to Lucy.

09:53.660 --> 09:56.580
Ah, you have the attorney general at 4
and the trade rep at 4:30.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.580
And you promised NPR five minutes.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.620
- Mr. President...
- Robin...

10:00.790 --> 10:02.500
Don't worry about it.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.820
Well, don't stop. It sounds great.
What is it?

10:27.860 --> 10:28.980
Scales.

10:29.610 --> 10:31.650
Well, you're playing with gusto.

10:31.910 --> 10:34.160
- Are my lips swollen?
- Are they supposed to be?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.370
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, you're doing just fine.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.870
- What you got behind your back?
- I have a little surprise for you.

10:40.410 --> 10:43.170
- Is it a dirt bike?
- No, ha, ha.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.710
Hmm.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.510
Is it a really old, seventh grade textbook
of yours...

10:49.670 --> 10:53.090
...that you want me to read and discuss
at dinner and drive me crazy with?

10:53.260 --> 10:56.300
Well, I'm not comfortable with the
"really old" part, but the rest was true.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.520
Understanding the Constitution.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.810
Your social studies teacher said you'll be
studying the Constitution this week.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.520
Wait, you talked to Mr. Linder?

11:05.690 --> 11:10.650
Yes, it's called a parent-teacher conference
and Mr. Linder and I were the key players.

11:11.530 --> 11:13.490
So why don't you like social studies,
Luce?

11:14.070 --> 11:15.070
I like it fine, Dad.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.950
Oh, come on, all your other teachers say
you're happy and enthusiastic.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.950
Mr. Linder says you never participate
unless he calls on you.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.080
Even then, it's a one-word answer.

11:25.460 --> 11:29.040
I don't know, Dad.
I guess I'm just not...

11:31.090 --> 11:32.460
I don't know.

11:32.630 --> 11:33.800
Luce...

11:33.970 --> 11:37.300
Take a look at this book.
This is exciting stuff.

11:37.470 --> 11:40.810
It's about who we are and what we want.

11:40.970 --> 11:43.230
Read what it says on the first page.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.270
"Property of Gilmore Junior High."

11:46.440 --> 11:48.730
The next page, Luce.

11:50.730 --> 11:53.150
"We, the people of the United States...

11:53.320 --> 11:56.780
- ...in order to form a perfect union"...
- It grabs you right away.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.990
This is a page-turner.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.490
I can't wait.

12:00.660 --> 12:03.790
Well, good. It's possible this subject
may come up at dinner.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.080
Do you see it as part of your job
to torture me?

12:06.250 --> 12:08.710
No, just one of the perks.
See you tonight.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
Yeah.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.470
The C-STAD hardware's
been in place for a month.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.470
We have 22 instructors
from the Army Air Defense School...

12:23.640 --> 12:25.600
...waiting to go and train the Israelis.

12:25.770 --> 12:27.350
How soon can you deploy them?

12:27.520 --> 12:31.230
We can airlift them by morning.
They'll have C-STAD operational in 20 days.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.780
Any security concerns?

12:32.940 --> 12:35.610
If anybody wanted to hit it,
they'd have hit it by now.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.910
Okay, let's move on it.
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:39.990 --> 12:41.830
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.870
- Good seeing you. Good night.
- You too. Good night.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.330
Have a good evening, Mrs. Chapil.
Janie, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.000
- You will.
- Good night, Janie. Night, Mrs. Chapil.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.570
- Mr. President, sir.
- Thank you.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.670
Leo Solomon brought in
a hired gun at the GDC.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.010
- It's about time.
- She's a lawyer from Virginia.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.680
Her name is Sydney Ellen Wade.
I know her pretty well.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.350
She's had a lot of success
getting congressmen elected.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.640
- Maybe we should try to steal her, heh.
- Ha, ha.

13:07.810 --> 13:11.400
Ten percent. Don't let them
leave the room till they're clear about that.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.150
Yes, sir.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.860
If you've got a free second,
stop in and say hello.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.190
It might smooth the way.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.700
- Mention it to Janie tomorrow.
- Good deal.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.830
Let's clear this off the table
and focus on the crime bill.

13:22.990 --> 13:26.290
I don't want to just win.
I want to win by a couple of touchdowns.

13:26.450 --> 13:28.330
We will, Mr. President.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.830
- A. J.?
- Sir.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.790
Robin said something to me today...

13:33.960 --> 13:36.210
...and I know
she wouldn't have said it if, uh...

13:37.220 --> 13:40.260
I mean, she wasn't saying it to me,
I realize.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.770
- Forget it. I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night, Mr. President.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.230
- A. J.?
- Yes, sir?

13:48.390 --> 13:52.350
When we're out of the office
and alone, you can call me Andy.

13:52.980 --> 13:53.980
I beg your pardon?

13:54.150 --> 13:57.480
You were the best man at my wedding,
for crying out loud. Call me Andy.

13:57.650 --> 14:00.700
Whatever you say, Mr. President.
Good night, sir.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.200
Good night, A.J.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.630
- Hi. I'm Sydney Ellen Wade.
- He needs your driver's license.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.300
- From Virginia.
- He doesn't care.

14:21.470 --> 14:24.110
- I'm meeting with Mr. MacInerney.
- He doesn't need to know that.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.680
Oh, forgive me.

14:26.850 --> 14:29.100
This is my first time at the White House.

14:29.270 --> 14:33.150
- I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality.
- He doesn't know what that means.

14:33.310 --> 14:36.230
Yeah, I do. Frank Capra.
Great American director.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.490
It's a Wonderful Life,
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.990
Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia,
knock them dead.

14:43.780 --> 14:44.990
Thanks.

14:45.830 --> 14:49.790
We'll start subsidizing private schools
the day we give up on public education.

14:49.950 --> 14:53.670
I know the proposal only scratches
the surface, but it's the least we can do.

14:53.830 --> 14:56.540
We'll let Harold look at it.
We'll revisit it next week.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.460
Jerry, say hello to Linda for me.
Have a good Thanksgiving.

14:59.630 --> 15:01.630
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.

15:03.090 --> 15:05.760
- How are we doing?
- You're four minutes ahead of schedule.

15:05.930 --> 15:06.970
- Ahead?
- Yes, sir.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.810
That's unprecedented.
I don't know what to do with myself.

15:09.970 --> 15:13.520
- Mr. Maclnerney asked me to remind you...
- Oh, the GDC meeting. Yeah.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.650
Rest assured your concerns
are not falling on deaf ears.

15:16.810 --> 15:20.650
The environmental lobby has known
no greater ally than President Shepherd.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.820
Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

15:24.110 --> 15:27.070
Sydney, we should leave Mr. Maclnerney
alone now. He's already...

15:27.240 --> 15:29.490
He doesn't want us to leave him alone...

15:29.660 --> 15:33.370
...because Mr. Maclnerney has not yet done
what he needs to do today.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.290
Sir, uh, Miss Wade's been thrown into
the deep end of the pool on her first day.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.630
She hasn't even had a chance to read
the report of the Quebec Conference.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.720
You're right. I haven't read it.

15:45.890 --> 15:48.390
If someone asked me yesterday,
I would've told them...

15:48.560 --> 15:50.850
...that it was made up
of six professional hockey teams.

15:52.230 --> 15:56.520
But what I do know is that it's time
for the president to run for president again.

15:56.690 --> 15:59.820
Kodak is as good as it gets
when it comes to electoral strategy.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.320
I'm sure he's told the president
what I'd tell him:

16:02.490 --> 16:06.660
Grab Michigan and California, where they
make cars, planes and burn fossil fuels.

16:06.820 --> 16:09.410
But if I'd read these 800 pages
I would've discovered...

16:09.580 --> 16:12.910
...that the burning of fossil fuels
is responsible for global warming...

16:13.120 --> 16:15.750
...and the 20 percent reduction
recommended by the GDC...

16:15.920 --> 16:19.250
...is a step toward arresting
the catastrophic greenhouse effect...

16:19.420 --> 16:21.750
...which has gone unchecked
by this administration.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.010
- It's time to...
- The chief of staff won't let us leave...

16:25.170 --> 16:27.510
...until he's broken the bad news.

16:30.970 --> 16:35.100
I'm afraid Sydney's right, although
not about Michigan and California.

16:35.270 --> 16:39.230
The president asked me to convey to you
he's sending his energy bill to the floor...

16:39.400 --> 16:42.570
...with a call for a 10 percent reduction.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.280
The president is willing
to go it alone on this...

16:45.450 --> 16:48.950
...but he's asking... Frankly,
he's expecting the full support of the GDC.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.370
He is expecting our full support?

16:51.530 --> 16:53.490
- Yes, he is.
- The president's dreaming.

16:53.660 --> 16:56.250
The president has critically
misjudged reality.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.370
If he thinks
the environmental community...

16:58.540 --> 17:01.250
...is gonna whistle a happy tune
while rallying support...

17:01.420 --> 17:04.500
...around this lame mockery
of environmental leadership...

17:04.670 --> 17:07.839
...just because he's nice
and done better than his predecessors...

17:08.010 --> 17:10.589
...then your boss is the chief executive
of Fantasyland.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.180
Let's take him out back
and beat the shit out of him.

17:13.349 --> 17:16.020
- Morning, Mr. President. How are you?
- Couldn't be better.

17:16.180 --> 17:19.810
My apologies for the interruption.
A.J. Suggested I come by and say hello.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.270
You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade
by any chance, would you?

17:24.440 --> 17:27.150
Mr. President, I'm, um...

17:27.319 --> 17:29.950
I don't know what to say. I'm speechless.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.740
All evidence to the contrary.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.080
Mr. President, we haven't met.
I'm Susan Sloan.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.210
I used to work with Congressman Myers.
I hope this incident won't jeopardize...

17:39.370 --> 17:40.460
Sydney?

17:40.630 --> 17:42.960
- Yes, sir.
- You have a second?

17:43.460 --> 17:44.920
Uh, of course.

17:51.140 --> 17:55.140
I thought maybe we might talk in private,
someplace less intimidating.

17:55.310 --> 17:57.100
- Janie.
- Yes, sir.

17:57.270 --> 18:01.520
This is Janie Basdin, my personal aide.
Show Miss Wade to the rec room, please.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.110
This way.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.860
I'll be with you in a second.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.210
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.260
- Mr. President...
- Is it all right if I call you Sydney?

18:30.680 --> 18:32.380
Of course. Mr. President...

18:32.550 --> 18:34.070
Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

18:34.220 --> 18:36.720
Uh, I've just been on the regular tour.
It didn't include...

18:36.890 --> 18:38.680
I hear it's pretty good.

18:38.850 --> 18:41.890
Mr. President, what you saw in there
was vanity run amuck.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.980
I was showing off for a colleague
who doesn't think much of me.

18:45.150 --> 18:49.530
It would be a real injustice to hold the GDC
accountable for my behavior today.

18:49.690 --> 18:54.700
On top of which, I am monumentally sorry
for having insulted you like that.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.370
Are you under the impression
I'm mad at you?

18:58.540 --> 18:59.910
Well, I...

19:00.080 --> 19:02.830
Seldom does a day go by
when I'm not burned in effigy.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.920
Not by a professional political operative
standing 30 feet from the Oval Office.

19:07.090 --> 19:08.800
Now, I'll grant you that.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.090
When the city planners sat down to design
Washington, D.C., their intention was...

19:13.260 --> 19:17.050
...to build a city that would intimidate
and humble foreign heads of state.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.680
- It's true.
- I didn't know that.

19:20.060 --> 19:24.270
The White House is the single greatest
home-court advantage in the modern world.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.980
I learned that one the hard way.

19:27.190 --> 19:29.110
Sydney, this bill is important to me.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.240
Yes, sir. I'll convey your message.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.780
But you don't believe me.

19:33.950 --> 19:36.530
The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.450
It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
It's a long shot at 10.

19:39.620 --> 19:42.660
How do you know that,
until you put the White House behind it?

19:42.830 --> 19:44.370
Sydney, at 20 percent...

19:44.540 --> 19:48.250
...we're 34 votes shy in the house.
It can't be done.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.420
But I'll tell you what.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.630
I'll make you a deal.

19:53.420 --> 19:57.640
If you can get 24 votes,
I'll get you the last 10.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.930
Twenty-four votes?

19:59.100 --> 20:01.770
If you can swing 24 votes
by the State of the Union...

20:01.930 --> 20:04.770
...I will promise you
full White House support.

20:04.940 --> 20:06.980
Do I have your word on that, sir?

20:07.150 --> 20:08.900
Absolutely.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.730
Listen, um...

20:11.900 --> 20:13.690
Are you hungry? I skipped breakfast.

20:13.860 --> 20:18.570
You wanna have a doughnut,
coffee or something?

20:21.740 --> 20:24.870
Sir, I'm a little intimidated
by my surroundings and yes...

20:25.040 --> 20:27.670
...I have gotten off
to a rocky and stilted beginning...

20:27.830 --> 20:30.500
...but don't let that diminish
the weight of my message.

20:30.670 --> 20:33.920
The GDC has been at every president
for the last decade and a half...

20:34.090 --> 20:35.920
...that global warming is a calamity...

20:36.090 --> 20:38.840
...the effects of which will be second
only to nuclear war.

20:39.010 --> 20:43.270
The best scientists have given you
every reason to take the GDC seriously...

20:43.430 --> 20:45.060
...but I'm gonna give you one more:

20:45.230 --> 20:48.190
If you don't live up to the deal
you made, come New Hampshire...

20:48.350 --> 20:50.730
...we're gonna go shopping
for a new candidate.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.480
You can't do that, Sydney.

20:52.650 --> 20:55.860
With all due respect, Mr. President,
who's going to stop me?

20:56.030 --> 20:59.490
Well, if you go through that door,
the United States Secret Service.

20:59.660 --> 21:00.990
That's my private office.

21:02.080 --> 21:07.210
- Ah.
- You have to go out that door over there.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.140
McSorley, McCluskey and Shane know
we're moving on the crime bill.

21:27.310 --> 21:29.270
They're circling the wagons
on assault weapons.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.560
Should I meet with them?

21:30.730 --> 21:33.110
- Let Lewis take a pass at them first.
- Fine.

21:33.270 --> 21:35.440
Two ball in the side.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.780
Nice shot, Mr. President.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.030
"Nice shot, Mr. President"?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.950
You won't even call me by my name
when we're playing pool?

21:45.120 --> 21:47.910
I will not do it playing pool,
I will not do it in a school.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.000
I do not like green eggs and ham,
I do not like them, Sam I am.

21:51.170 --> 21:52.960
At ease, A.J. At ease.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.630
- Would you get away from the pocket?
- I beg your pardon, sir.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.260
Nine ball in the corner.

22:04.010 --> 22:07.680
Solomon phoned. He said he was thrilled
with the deal you made this morning.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.350
I forgot to tell you.

22:10.310 --> 22:12.350
- It's a waste of time.
- But it's not ours.

22:12.520 --> 22:15.520
GDC makes a big push to get the votes.
When they come up short...

22:15.690 --> 22:19.360
...we move in with a softer bill,
get it passed. We're everybody's hero.

22:19.530 --> 22:21.400
Three ball in the side.

22:21.570 --> 22:23.780
Also, Sydney Wade called.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.740
Sydney Wade?

22:26.910 --> 22:30.540
She wanted to apologize one more time
for her behavior.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.670
Excuse me, sir.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.880
Three in the side.

22:38.210 --> 22:40.130
Did she say anything about me?

22:40.300 --> 22:42.090
- Miss Wade?
- When she called.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.720
Did she say anything about you?

22:43.890 --> 22:48.220
We had a nice couple of minutes together.
She threatened me, I patronized her.

22:48.390 --> 22:51.350
We didn't have anything to eat, but,
uh, I thought there was a connection.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.650
- Hmm, excuse me, sir.
- Sure.

22:53.810 --> 22:55.650
Thirteen in the corner.

22:57.860 --> 22:59.690
She didn't say anything about me?

22:59.860 --> 23:02.700
No, but I could pass her a note
before study hall.

23:05.870 --> 23:08.030
Well, tell me this. Hypothetically...

23:08.200 --> 23:09.620
I feel a nightmare coming on.

23:09.790 --> 23:12.210
What would happen
if I called Sydney Wade...

23:12.370 --> 23:15.920
...and asked her to be my date
at the state dinner on Thursday evening?

23:17.460 --> 23:20.210
- You're not serious.
- Don't I sound serious?

23:20.970 --> 23:25.300
- The president can't just go out on a date.
- Well, why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

23:25.470 --> 23:28.930
Wilson was widowed during his first term.
He met a woman, Edith Galt.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.220
He dated her, courted her, married her.

23:31.390 --> 23:34.100
And somewhere in there he managed
to form the League of Nations.

23:34.270 --> 23:37.360
Uh, Mr. President,
this is an election year.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.570
If you're looking
for female companionship...

23:39.730 --> 23:42.530
...we can make arrangements
that will ensure total privacy.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.240
I don't want you to get me a girl.
What is this, Vegas?

23:45.530 --> 23:47.070
No, sir. This is the White House.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.660
I'm talking about something
that is not a conflict with my oath of office.

23:50.830 --> 23:54.080
I'm a single adult. I met a woman
who I'd like to see again socially.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.250
How is that different
from what Wilson did?

23:56.420 --> 23:59.340
The difference is he didn't have to be
president on television.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.210
You said it yourself a million times:

24:01.380 --> 24:04.340
If there had been a TV
in every living room 60 years ago...

24:04.510 --> 24:07.260
...this country does not elect a man
in a wheelchair.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.970
So what are you saying?

24:10.140 --> 24:12.810
- I'm saying we'll take a hit.
- How big?

24:13.270 --> 24:15.230
I don't know. Five points, maybe more.

24:15.730 --> 24:18.770
- We're talking here about five points?
- Could be more.

24:18.940 --> 24:22.030
I'd drop five points if Wisconsin
doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.

24:22.190 --> 24:24.150
Five ball in the corner.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.280
Want me to have Kodak put together
some numbers so we know?

24:28.450 --> 24:29.620
Yeah. Yeah.

24:29.780 --> 24:32.740
No. I don't want a checkup polling sample
to see if it's okay...

24:32.910 --> 24:36.290
...like I'm asking permission
to stay out an hour past curfew.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.960
This is not the business
of the American people.

24:39.380 --> 24:40.710
With all due respect, sir...

24:40.880 --> 24:44.710
...Americans have a funny way of deciding
what is and what is not their business.

24:47.260 --> 24:49.090
I like her, A.J.

24:53.220 --> 24:56.270
Stop being my chief of staff
for one minute.

24:58.150 --> 24:59.350
Give her a call.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.640
Janie!

25:03.320 --> 25:05.110
She didn't say anything about me?

25:05.280 --> 25:08.700
Uh, she did say you were taller
than she thought you'd be.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
Well, that's something.

25:12.330 --> 25:13.450
Yes, sir.

25:13.620 --> 25:16.290
Janie, I need you to track down
a phone number for me.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.540
Richard, Richard...

25:20.710 --> 25:22.250
It wasn't funny.

25:22.420 --> 25:25.210
I acted like a college freshman
at a protest rally.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.590
Tell him about
walking out the wrong door.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.260
Oh, God. I forgot about that.

25:30.430 --> 25:34.390
No, Richard, no. No, I don't want to hear
your Andrew Shepherd imitation.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
I want to hear it.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.310
I'm hanging up now, Richard.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.940
Uh, tonight I was gonna go to bed early
and wake up when there's a new president.

25:42.940 --> 25:45.820
Pssh, the president must think
I'm a third-rate jerk.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.990
If he thinks you're a jerk,
he thinks you're a first-rate jerk.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.780
I'll tell you one thing, boy. I regrouped.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.700
You gotta give me that.
I pulled it together at the end.

25:54.870 --> 25:58.500
I stood in the middle of the Oval Office
and made it clear that from now on...

25:58.660 --> 26:01.750
...he who doesn't take the GDC seriously,
does so at his peril.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.670
And then you walked out
the wrong door.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.210
You gonna throw that at me
the rest of my life?

26:06.510 --> 26:08.050
That's my current plan, yes.

26:09.550 --> 26:12.340
Oh, that's gonna be Leo Solomon.
He said he'd call at 9.

26:12.510 --> 26:14.050
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi.

26:14.220 --> 26:15.310
Is this Sydney?

26:15.470 --> 26:18.560
- Leo?
- No, this is Andrew Shepherd.

26:18.730 --> 26:20.350
Oh, it's Andrew Shepherd.

26:20.520 --> 26:24.230
Yeah, you're hilarious, Richard.
You're just a regular riot.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.480
No, this isn't Richard.
This is Andrew Shepherd.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.190
Ah, well, I'm so glad you called...

26:29.360 --> 26:32.740
...because I forgot to tell you today
what a nice ass you have.

26:32.910 --> 26:37.620
I'm also impressed that you got my number,
given the fact that I don't have a phone.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.830
- Good night, Richard.
- Uh, this isn't Rich...

26:42.750 --> 26:45.380
This used to be easier.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.220
- I can't believe this.
- You want me to deal with him?

26:52.380 --> 26:57.100
No way. I may choke in front of Shepherd.
Richard Reynolds, I can handle. Hello?

26:57.850 --> 26:58.890
Sydney?

26:59.060 --> 27:00.310
Are you learning-impaired?

27:00.480 --> 27:03.060
Listen, do me a favor. Hang up the phone.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
What?

27:04.770 --> 27:09.110
Hang up the phone, then dial 456-1414.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.110
When you get
the White House operator...

27:11.280 --> 27:15.110
...give her your name and tell her
you want to speak to the president.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.750
Oh, my God.

27:21.910 --> 27:23.790
This isn't happening to me.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.040
What's going on?

27:25.420 --> 27:28.960
No, it's not possible
I did this twice in one day.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.720
Good evening, the White House.

27:38.260 --> 27:39.560
- Hello?
- Hi.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.980
My name's Sydney Ellen Wade.
I'd like to...

27:42.140 --> 27:44.980
The president's expecting your call, ma'am.
I'll put you right through.

27:48.610 --> 27:49.730
Hello?

27:49.900 --> 27:51.860
Mr. President, heh, um...

27:52.030 --> 27:56.160
Uh... Uh, I'm sure there's an appropriate
thing to say at this moment, uh...

27:56.320 --> 28:01.200
Probably some formal apology for
the "nice ass" remark would be in order.

28:01.450 --> 28:03.040
I don't quite know how to word it.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.620
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have called you at home.

28:05.790 --> 28:09.090
- Should I call you at the office tomorrow?
- No, no. Of course not.

28:09.300 --> 28:13.210
I mean, yes. You can call me
any time you want. This is fine, right now.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.760
When I said "of course not," I meant...

28:15.930 --> 28:18.800
Know what? The hell with it.
I'm moving to another country.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.720
What did you mean when you said
you didn't have a phone?

28:21.890 --> 28:25.480
Oh, I just moved here over the weekend
and my apartment isn't ready yet.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.690
This is my sister's apartment. Come to
think of it, how did you get this number?

28:29.860 --> 28:32.030
How did I get the number?
That's a good question.

28:32.190 --> 28:35.280
Um, I don't know. Probably the FBI.

28:35.450 --> 28:37.240
Oh, the FBI. Sure.

28:37.410 --> 28:41.410
Because if you want to find someone, and
you're the president, that's who you'd call.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.020
You know who else is good at that?

28:43.160 --> 28:44.760
Uh, CIA?

28:45.960 --> 28:48.330
I was thinking
of the Internal Revenue Service.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.630
They have these computer files
that, uh...

28:51.800 --> 28:54.010
Well, I, ahem, should stop stalling.

28:54.170 --> 28:59.260
Um, as you probably know, the French
have elected themselves a new president.

28:59.430 --> 29:02.930
We're having a formal state dinner
at the White House and I was wondering...

29:03.100 --> 29:06.600
...and, uh, you're under no obligation
of law, but I thought it might be fun.

29:06.770 --> 29:09.650
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to go...

29:09.810 --> 29:12.270
...with me and, um...

29:12.440 --> 29:15.610
Well, that's it. That's why I was calling.

29:21.580 --> 29:22.980
Sydney?

29:24.160 --> 29:27.160
- Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long.
- Mr. President...

29:29.670 --> 29:34.170
You have asked me to join you
in representing our country.

29:34.340 --> 29:38.930
I'm honored. I'm equal to the task.
I won't let you down, sir.

29:39.720 --> 29:43.510
This is just dinner. We're not going
to be doing espionage or anything.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.560
No, of course, ha, ha.

29:45.720 --> 29:48.640
I'm a little, um... Uh...

29:48.810 --> 29:50.980
What do I do? Ha-ha-ha!

29:51.150 --> 29:55.230
I mean, you know, where do I go?
I mean, will you meet me?

29:56.030 --> 29:59.450
I'm gonna have a very nice woman
named Marsha Bridgeport call you.

29:59.610 --> 30:01.530
She's the White House social secretary.

30:01.700 --> 30:04.160
She's gonna help you
with anything you want.

30:04.330 --> 30:07.790
Now, when she calls you and tells you
her name is Marsha Bridgeport...

30:07.960 --> 30:10.420
...it'll help if you give her
the benefit of the doubt.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.340
- Of course.
- And I'll see you Thursday night.

30:15.630 --> 30:19.300
Mr. President,
thanks for asking me, really.

30:19.470 --> 30:22.970
- This is a first for me.
- Me too.

30:29.310 --> 30:32.900
Okay, who's on Indiana? New people?
I can't remember your names.

30:33.060 --> 30:37.110
Raise your hands if you're on Indiana.
Put your hands down. You're on Illinois.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.240
- We got Jarrett.
- What?

30:39.700 --> 30:42.280
George Jarrett. He's ours, solid "yes."

30:42.450 --> 30:44.660
I don't believe it. You, new guy...

30:44.830 --> 30:48.870
Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota,
slide his name on over to "yes."

30:49.410 --> 30:53.210
He was undecided. How did you get
the fence pole out of his butt?

30:53.380 --> 30:57.040
Wish I could take credit. He says,
"Lewis, I support the president 100 percent.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.710
Not the bill, the president."

30:58.880 --> 31:01.970
We're gonna win this.
It's like a kissing booth at a carnival:

31:02.130 --> 31:04.720
Give us a vote, get a photo op
with number 63.

31:04.890 --> 31:08.180
- We should've gone after the handguns.
- One thing at a time.

31:08.390 --> 31:10.430
We don't have time
to do one thing at a time.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.560
- Yeah, hi.
It's David in Sydney Wade's office.

31:14.730 --> 31:16.360
Yeah, I'll hold.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.900
I'm from Sydney Wade's office. I wanna
confirm her lunch with the congressman.

31:21.070 --> 31:23.610
We can do with a little party leadership.

31:24.820 --> 31:27.870
I mean, is the Majority Whip
taking a break?

31:28.040 --> 31:30.950
Congress is in session, right?
I'm not wrong about that.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.910
I just got off with Luther Simons.

31:33.080 --> 31:35.170
- Brock's on board.
- Terrific.

31:35.330 --> 31:37.750
All right, well, have him get back to me.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.840
You okay, Syd?

31:42.720 --> 31:43.760
Sure, why?

31:43.930 --> 31:46.180
I don't know. You seem a little tense.

31:46.350 --> 31:48.140
What do you mean?

31:51.770 --> 31:54.890
What do you have, big date tonight?

32:16.380 --> 32:19.670
Senator, Senator Rumson,
if I can have a moment with you, sir.

32:19.840 --> 32:20.840
Certainly.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.760
I'm standing here with
Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson...

32:23.920 --> 32:27.090
...one of the many guests arriving at what,
for the next few hours...

32:27.260 --> 32:29.050
...will be a nonpartisan White House.

32:29.510 --> 32:32.810
Senator, the latest public-opinion surveys
show the president...

32:32.980 --> 32:36.890
...with approval ratings that would make him
all but unbeatable come next November.

32:37.060 --> 32:39.730
Is there a Republican who can mount
a serious challenge...

32:39.900 --> 32:41.320
...and are you that candidate?

32:41.480 --> 32:45.820
It's a long time till November. Right now
I'm looking forward to a pleasant evening.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.030
Thank you, senator.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.950
That's a little tight, Luce.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.330
It's supposed to be.
It's supposed to make you look regal.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.420
Is it supposed to cut off
the blood flow to my face?

32:59.460 --> 33:00.840
All done.

33:05.220 --> 33:08.380
Well, that's not bad.
Where'd you learn how to do that?

33:08.550 --> 33:09.680
Social studies.

33:09.850 --> 33:12.220
Very funny. No, really,
where'd you learn that?

33:12.810 --> 33:15.730
I don't know. I just...
Guess I picked it up somewhere.

33:16.980 --> 33:19.560
Sweetie, did Mom teach you
how to do that?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
Yeah.

33:24.440 --> 33:28.740
Lucy, is this okay,
my having dinner with a lady?

33:28.910 --> 33:30.070
Dad, it's totally okay.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.760
You sure? Because if there's anything
you want to talk about...

33:32.910 --> 33:36.410
Dad. It's cool. Just go for it.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
Okay.

33:40.750 --> 33:41.990
You know, I'm a little nervous.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.960
You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.960
Be myself?

33:46.130 --> 33:49.090
Yeah, and, um, compliment her shoes.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.840
Her shoes?

33:51.350 --> 33:53.550
Yeah. Girls like that.

33:54.930 --> 33:57.480
Okay. Thanks.

34:08.360 --> 34:09.570
- Thank you.
- Miss Wade?

34:09.739 --> 34:10.860
- Oh, hi.
- Good evening.

34:11.030 --> 34:13.780
The president would like you
to join him in the residence.

34:13.949 --> 34:16.620
- May I show you the way?
- Of course.

34:29.469 --> 34:32.010
Sydney, come on in. You look beautiful.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.260
Thanks.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.360
- I promise you, there's no hidden agenda.
- Heh.

34:36.460 --> 34:37.639
You know my wife, Esther.

34:37.810 --> 34:40.560
- Nice to see you again.
- Sydney.

34:41.190 --> 34:43.230
Andrew Shepherd.
We spoke on the phone.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.650
Yes, sir. I remember.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.360
- Excuse me one minute.
- Ha, ha.

34:47.530 --> 34:51.699
The president told me how you two met,
Sydney. I think it's priceless.

34:51.860 --> 34:55.739
One minute I was calling him
a mockery of an environmental leader...

34:55.909 --> 34:57.620
...the next minute I had a date.

34:57.790 --> 35:01.160
Men like being insulted by women.
It makes them feel loved.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.460
Don't ask me why.

35:02.620 --> 35:05.580
Mr. President, allow me
to introduce to you Sydney Ellen Wade...

35:05.750 --> 35:07.420
...of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.340
This is President René Jean D'Astier and...

35:10.510 --> 35:13.010
...his wife, Monique Danielle D'Astier,
of France.

35:13.180 --> 35:16.390
- It's a great pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor to meet you both.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.140
I'm so pleased to meet you.

35:18.310 --> 35:22.100
Ahem, Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt.
The receiving line is in place.

35:22.270 --> 35:25.100
Sydney, I think our table's ready.

35:32.490 --> 35:36.120
I've got to do a thing at the bottom
of the stairs, but you'll be escorted...

35:36.280 --> 35:38.370
- They took me through it.
- Oh, good.

35:38.540 --> 35:40.950
Do you do this often, sir?

35:41.120 --> 35:43.500
This is actually
only our second state dinner.

35:43.670 --> 35:46.080
The first one was
for the Emperor of Japan...

35:46.250 --> 35:49.500
...who died shortly after,
so we stopped having them, just in case.

35:49.670 --> 35:52.300
I meant do you go out on, uh...
Do you often...

35:52.470 --> 35:53.880
- Do I date a lot?
- Yeah.

35:54.050 --> 35:55.470
No, how about you?

35:55.640 --> 35:59.640
Me? Well, lately I seem to be going out
on a lot of first dates.

35:59.810 --> 36:02.680
- You're experienced at this.
- You could ask me anything.

36:02.850 --> 36:04.100
How are we doing so far?

36:04.270 --> 36:08.860
It's hard to say at this point.
So far it's just your typical first-date stuff.

36:09.270 --> 36:11.570
Damn, I wanted to be different
from the others.

36:11.740 --> 36:15.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.240
By the way...

36:16.410 --> 36:17.820
- Accompanied by...
- Nice shoes.

36:17.990 --> 36:21.330
The president of France
and Madame D'Astier.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.110
- Mr. President?
- Yeah?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.830
The president and Mrs. D'Astier look bored.

37:01.660 --> 37:03.740
They're not talking to anybody.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.330
- They're hammered.
- Ha, ha.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.130
- Esther, do you speak French?
- Latin.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.750
- I thought you spoke French.
- No, Latin.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.360
Great. Next time Julius Caesar
comes to town, you're our gal.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.800
Sydney, I don't suppose that...

37:27.980 --> 37:29.140
That's my date.

37:40.950 --> 37:41.950
Really?

37:43.950 --> 37:46.370
You didn't dissolve our trade agreements,
did you? Heh.

37:46.540 --> 37:49.540
Heh, no. I just said we're sitting
in this beautiful room...

37:49.710 --> 37:52.290
...listening to the music
of this wonderful orchestra...

37:52.460 --> 37:54.460
...and I wondered
why nobody was dancing.

37:54.630 --> 37:56.670
I told Miss Wade that, in my country...

37:56.840 --> 38:00.130
...a guest of the palace
of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette...

38:00.300 --> 38:02.470
...would soon find their head
in a guillotine...

38:02.640 --> 38:05.260
...if they made the impertinent gesture
of dancing...

38:05.430 --> 38:08.640
...without so much as a by-your-leave
from the king and the queen.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.440
I bet no one accused Louis
of being soft on crime.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.940
- There's a lesson there, Mr. President.
- More beheadings at the White House.

38:18.110 --> 38:20.030
Bob Rumson would embrace it.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.360
Yes, I'm sure he would.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.370
I have a better idea.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.170
Would you like to dance?

38:31.880 --> 38:32.880
Ah.

38:33.130 --> 38:34.790
Yeah, I guess.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.170
I mean, yes, sir...

38:37.340 --> 38:39.050
...I'd love to.

38:55.650 --> 38:57.360
They're dancing.

39:14.330 --> 39:16.750
I don't know how you do it.

39:17.210 --> 39:19.960
- It's Arthur Murray. Six lessons.
- Ha-ha-ha.

39:20.170 --> 39:21.920
That's not what I mean.

39:22.590 --> 39:27.300
Two hundred pairs of eyes are focused
on you right now with two questions:

39:27.470 --> 39:31.350
"Who's this girl?" and,
"Why is the president dancing with her?"

39:31.520 --> 39:35.980
Well, first of all, the 200 pairs of eyes
are not focused on me.

39:36.150 --> 39:38.440
They're focused on you.

39:38.900 --> 39:41.860
And the answers are,
"Sydney Ellen Wade.

39:42.030 --> 39:44.410
Because she said 'yes."'

40:17.150 --> 40:19.650
- Does the setup here work?
- How's it going?

40:24.740 --> 40:27.360
- Good morning, Mrs. Chapil.
- Morning, Mr. President.

40:27.530 --> 40:29.830
Mr. Rothschild and Miss McCall
are in the office.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.290
They said they need to speak with you.

40:32.450 --> 40:34.830
Janie, can you get me the number
of a local florist?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.580
Where do you want them sent?

40:36.750 --> 40:39.750
No, I want to do it myself.
I just need the number.

40:40.340 --> 40:41.380
I don't understand.

40:44.340 --> 40:47.130
I want the phone number of a florist.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.220
You just want the phone number.

40:50.310 --> 40:51.310
Yeah.

40:52.270 --> 40:54.580
- Sir, is there a problem...
- I want to send some flowers.

40:54.680 --> 40:58.480
I want to do it myself. I don't want
to staff it out. No executive orders.

40:58.650 --> 41:00.400
I just want a phone number.

41:01.190 --> 41:03.820
I'll get it for you right away, sir.

41:04.570 --> 41:06.110
- Morning.
- Good morning.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.780
We need five minutes of your time.

41:07.950 --> 41:09.570
I'll be with you in two minutes.

41:09.740 --> 41:11.200
I just need to make a call.

41:11.450 --> 41:12.790
Thank you, Janie.

41:17.710 --> 41:19.000
Who are we calling, sir?

41:19.830 --> 41:23.590
The Organization of United Brotherhood
of It's None of Your Damn Business.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.260
- I'll be with you in a second.
- Yes, sir.

41:32.350 --> 41:33.890
Yeah, hi, good morning.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.890
How do I get an outside line?

41:37.310 --> 41:39.310
Well, that was simple.

41:41.820 --> 41:43.980
- Janie?
- Yes.

41:44.150 --> 41:46.280
What's the president doing?

41:46.440 --> 41:50.160
I'm sorry, I'm really not at liberty to say.

41:50.660 --> 41:54.410
Yes, hi, good morning.
Is this Carmen's House of Flowers?

41:54.580 --> 41:57.700
Good. I'd like to order
some flowers, please.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.000
Well, tell me,
what is the state flower of Virginia?

42:02.500 --> 42:05.170
Does this have something to do
with Sydney Wade?

42:05.340 --> 42:08.130
I'm really not at liberty to say.

42:08.300 --> 42:11.010
Well, is there anybody there
who might know?

42:11.970 --> 42:14.930
No, I'm not trying to be difficult.
Uh...

42:15.100 --> 42:16.850
Hang on, please.

42:18.230 --> 42:20.690
Janie, what is the state flower
of Virginia?

42:20.850 --> 42:24.060
- Mrs. Chapil, state flower of Virginia?
- The dogwood.

42:24.770 --> 42:26.820
The dogwood, sir.

42:26.990 --> 42:28.400
Thank you.

42:29.610 --> 42:31.410
It's a dogwood.

42:32.530 --> 42:33.930
Really?

42:34.530 --> 42:37.080
Ah, hold on, please. Ahem.

42:37.250 --> 42:40.160
Janie, the dogwood's a tree,
it's not a flower.

42:40.330 --> 42:42.290
Actually, it's a tree and a flower.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.330
- Are you sure?
- Yes. What's going on?

42:44.790 --> 42:47.340
Sir, it's a tree and a flower.

42:49.340 --> 42:53.390
The dogwood is a tree and a flower.
I'd like a dozen, please.

42:54.300 --> 42:56.050
Really, no dogwoods?

42:57.390 --> 42:59.350
How about, uh, roses?

42:59.520 --> 43:01.980
Simple, classic. Two dozen?

43:02.150 --> 43:03.310
Janie...

43:03.480 --> 43:07.360
I'm the president's senior domestic
policy advisor. Now, it's important...

43:07.530 --> 43:10.320
Janie, do you know
where my credit cards are?

43:12.200 --> 43:14.490
They're in storage in Wisconsin
with the rest...

43:14.660 --> 43:17.490
...of your personal items.
- All right.

43:17.660 --> 43:22.790
Perhaps it would be better if you bill me.
I'm sure it'll be all right with your boss.

43:23.750 --> 43:28.000
I don't know if you recognize my voice,
but, uh, this is the president.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.670
Of the United States.

43:32.220 --> 43:33.420
Hello?

43:36.010 --> 43:38.220
Leo, you wanted to see me?

43:38.390 --> 43:39.930
So there I was thinking:

43:40.100 --> 43:41.680
Maybe I should give Sydney a call.

43:41.850 --> 43:43.980
She's new in town,
doesn't know many people.

43:44.150 --> 43:45.440
Then I picked up the Times.

43:45.900 --> 43:49.110
Leo, it was crazy. He called me at home.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.360
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

43:51.530 --> 43:55.030
It was innocent.
His cousin got the flu at the last minute.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.280
- Did you sleep with him?
- Leo.

43:57.450 --> 44:00.410
- Did you sleep with him?
- That's none of your business, Leo.

44:00.620 --> 44:04.080
- Yeah, it is, Sydney.
- You wanna tell me how my personal life...

44:04.250 --> 44:06.710
Because when it's the president,
it's not personal.

44:06.880 --> 44:10.710
I hired your reputation, Sydney.
I hired a pit bull, not a prom queen.

44:10.880 --> 44:14.680
- That's unfair.
- It's incredibly unfair.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.720
You spent time over the years telling me
the trouble with the environmental lobby...

44:18.890 --> 44:21.090
...is that we don't understand
the fundamental truth...

44:21.220 --> 44:22.890
...that politics is perception.

44:23.060 --> 44:24.890
This is a bad time to develop ignorance.

44:25.060 --> 44:27.310
- You're making way too much of this.
- Am I?

44:28.060 --> 44:32.030
This is your time, Sydney.
You're sitting at the grown-up's table.

44:32.190 --> 44:34.440
You have a chance to get
everything you want:

44:34.610 --> 44:38.660
Run a national campaign,
be a major player inside the party.

44:39.330 --> 44:41.290
This relationship
better go all the way...

44:41.450 --> 44:45.000
...because with the leader of the free world,
there's no halfway.

44:45.290 --> 44:47.120
Politics is perception...

44:47.290 --> 44:48.880
...and if this doesn't work out...

44:49.040 --> 44:51.550
...the time it'll take
to go from being a hired gun...

44:51.710 --> 44:54.210
...to a cocktail-party joke
can be clocked with an egg timer.

44:54.380 --> 44:58.550
Leo, there's no relationship.
It was one night. It's done.

44:58.760 --> 45:01.720
Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
by a White House messenger.

45:01.890 --> 45:03.060
It's marked "perishable."

45:03.390 --> 45:05.430
The White House sent me
something perishable?

45:05.600 --> 45:07.020
It's for Miss Wade.

45:07.190 --> 45:11.060
- Here we go.
- Relax, Leo, I'm sure it's just a formality.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.320
- It's from him.
- Of course it's from him.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.240
So he had some staff flunky
send me a fruit basket.

45:16.400 --> 45:19.700
- Well, he wrote the note himself.
- I'm sure he didn't take the time...

45:19.870 --> 45:23.450
The messenger waited 10 minutes
while the president wrote the card.

45:23.790 --> 45:26.000
Okay, listen...

45:26.790 --> 45:31.380
- It took him 10 minutes to write the card?
- Apparently, he went through several drafts.

45:47.100 --> 45:48.190
What is it?

45:48.690 --> 45:49.900
- A ham.
- A ham?

45:51.310 --> 45:54.070
He sent me a Virginia ham.

45:54.230 --> 45:56.990
Dig it, Miss Wade,
you're the president's girlfriend.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.950
There's never an egg timer around
when you need one.

46:05.450 --> 46:06.830
Thanks.

46:09.710 --> 46:11.040
They'll be pressing today...

46:11.210 --> 46:14.500
...if we're prepared to soften
the assault weapons section of the bill.

46:14.670 --> 46:17.260
There's no need to entertain that
at this point.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.340
How do you want me to handle
the Sydney issue?

46:23.680 --> 46:25.640
"The Sydney issue"?

46:25.810 --> 46:28.890
We should have a consensus
on how the White House will handle it.

46:29.060 --> 46:33.690
I certainly hope "the Sydney issue" refers
to a problem we're having with Australia.

46:33.860 --> 46:36.440
- If it's anything other than that...
- Ahem, Mr. President...

46:36.610 --> 46:38.490
Miss Wade is here to see you.

46:38.650 --> 46:41.450
Have her come in, please.
I am finished here.

46:41.610 --> 46:42.780
Yes, sir.

46:42.950 --> 46:44.740
There is no Sydney issue.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.870
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi. Hi.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.540
Uh, thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

46:53.710 --> 46:55.920
No problem.
Did you, uh, get the ham?

46:56.090 --> 46:57.750
Ha, ha, yes, I got the ham.

46:57.920 --> 47:02.050
I wanted to send you some flowers,
but there appear to be kinks in the system.

47:02.220 --> 47:05.890
I'm so glad you stopped by.
I had such a good time last night.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.770
- So did I. Um, it's just that I... Um...
- They're 45 seconds away.

47:09.930 --> 47:13.350
I have a luncheon speech
at the governors' conference. I'm sorry.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.190
- Are you free for dinner tomorrow evening?
- Dinner?

47:16.360 --> 47:17.440
Casual, in the residence...

47:17.570 --> 47:19.050
...without the United Nations.
- Heh.

47:19.190 --> 47:21.530
My daughter will be there,
so it may seem like it.

47:21.700 --> 47:24.950
- I'd love to meet Lucy...
- She'd love to meet you. Excuse me, Jeff...

47:25.120 --> 47:26.990
Actually, I have some concerns that I...

47:27.160 --> 47:28.450
- Yes, sir.
- I can't do this.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.940
- Robbins or Stackhouse?
- Either. I have to be in and out.

47:31.040 --> 47:34.170
Stackhouse needs 10 minutes.
I think it's about the assault weapons.

47:34.330 --> 47:37.090
He wants to talk about grazing rights.
Trust me.

47:37.250 --> 47:39.130
I'm sorry. You have concerns?

47:39.300 --> 47:42.050
Yes, uh, not many. A few.

47:42.220 --> 47:43.840
One. I have one concern.

47:44.010 --> 47:46.690
This wouldn't have to do
with the fact that one of us is president?

47:46.800 --> 47:49.140
Ha, ha,
you like to make jokes about this...

47:49.310 --> 47:51.950
I'm not mocking you.
I'm just a guy asking a girl over for a meal.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.770
What's that?

47:55.190 --> 47:56.770
That's my ride.

47:57.150 --> 47:58.950
Oh, um...

48:00.070 --> 48:04.740
Leo Solomon has some serious concerns
about me exploring a social...

48:04.910 --> 48:06.910
...you know...

48:07.070 --> 48:09.870
...scenario with the president
of the United States.

48:10.040 --> 48:12.500
Put that way,
it doesn't sound good to me either.

48:12.660 --> 48:14.700
Have dinner with Lucy and me.
It's meat loaf night.

48:14.830 --> 48:16.880
- How presidential can that be?
- Uh...

48:17.040 --> 48:18.130
Seven-thirty?

48:19.340 --> 48:20.340
Mm.

48:20.630 --> 48:21.830
Mm-hm.

48:51.410 --> 48:54.000
- Hi. Are you Miss Wade?
- Hi. Uh, Sydney.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.460
- Hi. Lucy Shepherd. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

48:57.630 --> 49:02.880
Um, my dad told me to tell you
that he's on the phone with his dentist...

49:03.050 --> 49:05.840
...and I should behave myself
and entertain you until he gets back.

49:06.010 --> 49:08.470
Ah. Your father's on the phone
with his dentist?

49:08.640 --> 49:11.890
No. He told me to tell you
that he's on the phone with his dentist.

49:12.060 --> 49:14.600
- He wants you to think he's a regular guy.
- Heh, all right.

49:14.770 --> 49:17.890
- Well, who's he on the phone with?
- The Prime Minister of Israel.

49:18.060 --> 49:21.150
- They're probably not discussing his teeth.
- I hope not.

49:22.860 --> 49:25.610
They're discussing that abbreviation
I can never remember.

49:25.780 --> 49:28.910
- Mm, C-STAD?
- Yeah.

49:29.070 --> 49:32.620
- Capricorn Surface-to-Air Defense.
- Right.

49:33.200 --> 49:36.200
Okay. Let meat-loaf night begin. Hi.

49:36.370 --> 49:38.420
Hi. How's everything with your teeth?

49:38.580 --> 49:40.250
- My teeth?
- The dentist.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.500
Oh, right. Right, right.

49:41.670 --> 49:44.050
Yeah, I got a cavity
in my upper bicuspid region.

49:44.210 --> 49:47.170
You have a short-range weapons system
outside Tel Aviv.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.760
I think somebody told on me.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.060
Congressman...

50:02.230 --> 50:03.480
You're over-thinking this.

50:03.650 --> 50:06.940
Voters aren't interested
in how to achieve economic growth.

50:07.110 --> 50:10.160
They don't want to hear our plans
to strengthen foreign policy.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.780
So it comes down to character.

50:11.950 --> 50:14.160
Press like him.
The networks, the newspapers...

50:14.330 --> 50:15.830
Reporters like him.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.620
Networks and newspapers
like ratings and circulation.

50:19.790 --> 50:23.340
For all the bitching we do
about liberal bias in the press...

50:23.500 --> 50:25.750
...when it comes to
a good character debate...

50:25.920 --> 50:28.050
The press is an unwitting accomplice.

50:28.220 --> 50:30.090
The character debate didn't work for us.

50:30.260 --> 50:32.050
Because it couldn't.

50:32.220 --> 50:36.430
Our polling told us that attacking him
less than a year after he'd lost his wife...

50:36.600 --> 50:39.770
...was gonna be a turnoff,
was gonna make people feel sorry for him.

50:39.940 --> 50:43.270
We couldn't run the campaign we wanted
because the opponent was a widower.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.190
But he's still a widower, Bob.
Time's passed but...

50:48.280 --> 50:49.820
You'll have to forgive my friend.

50:49.990 --> 50:52.740
He was on a hunting trip.
He's been cut off from the world.

50:52.910 --> 50:54.320
Why? What's going on?

51:01.670 --> 51:04.210
The president's got a girlfriend.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.380
So you're studying
the Constitutional Convention.

51:09.550 --> 51:11.550
- She's not having any fun, though.
- Dad.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.260
You're not having any fun?

51:13.430 --> 51:16.010
This is a nightmare.
This is a social-studies nightmare.

51:16.180 --> 51:17.560
They're doing a mock congress.

51:17.720 --> 51:21.350
Each kid plays one of the original delegates
and they debate the amendments.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.560
What's not fun?

51:22.730 --> 51:25.310
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, sweetheart.

51:26.940 --> 51:29.980
- It was nice meeting you, Sydney.
- It was nice to meet you.

51:30.150 --> 51:33.320
- Sleep well, honey. I love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.660
She's wonderful.

51:36.030 --> 51:37.530
She's her mother.

51:38.870 --> 51:40.160
She's you.

51:45.540 --> 51:47.590
Would you like the 25-cent tour?

51:48.670 --> 51:49.670
Okay.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.970
I thought C-STAD wouldn't be operational
until January.

51:56.140 --> 52:00.100
It was ready ahead of schedule.
We've just been waiting for the personnel.

52:00.270 --> 52:02.020
- The Israelis?
- No, our guys.

52:02.180 --> 52:06.480
We sent a team of army instructors
to train the Israelis. Good evening.

52:06.650 --> 52:08.730
I think, uh...

52:08.900 --> 52:11.400
Yeah, this is the Dish Room.

52:12.860 --> 52:14.070
It's not the "Dish Room."

52:14.240 --> 52:16.410
Yes, it is. It's the room
with, uh, all the dishes.

52:16.570 --> 52:18.240
It's the China Room.

52:18.620 --> 52:20.830
Well, I'm more of a West Wing president.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.500
If you're curious about the mansion,
I'm sure there's a book you can get.

52:24.670 --> 52:28.710
There are about 7000.
Heh, I'll get one for you.

52:43.060 --> 52:44.460
Sydney.

52:47.100 --> 52:48.190
Mr. President...

52:48.360 --> 52:51.650
...have you ever noticed how similar
the Van Buren flatware is...

52:51.820 --> 52:54.190
...to the Buchanan flatware?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.700
Do you think there'll ever be a time...

53:00.870 --> 53:03.660
...when you can stand in a room
with me...

53:03.870 --> 53:06.330
...and not think of me as the president?

53:07.750 --> 53:09.750
This isn't a state of mind.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.000
You are the president.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.130
And when I'm in a room with you...

53:15.300 --> 53:17.590
...oval or any other shape...

53:17.760 --> 53:19.930
...I'm always going to be a lobbyist...

53:20.100 --> 53:22.680
...and you're always going
to be the president.

53:23.350 --> 53:26.060
I have news for you, Sydney.

53:26.230 --> 53:27.940
As a lobbyist...

53:28.100 --> 53:30.810
...you'd never be alone in a room...

53:30.980 --> 53:32.770
...with the president.

53:40.620 --> 53:42.740
Do you think this is a good idea?

53:45.790 --> 53:47.790
Probably not.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.670
Mr. President.

53:59.430 --> 54:01.340
We have a secure call from the Sit Room.

54:04.220 --> 54:05.850
Excuse me.

54:11.480 --> 54:14.980
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Oh, no, of course.

54:20.910 --> 54:25.200
We're gonna have to cut our evening short.
The Libyans have just bombed C-STAD.

54:25.370 --> 54:29.210
I'll try to call you in the morning.
Would you please show Miss Wade out?

54:30.960 --> 54:33.130
The response scenario's in place.

54:33.500 --> 54:36.920
The F-18s are fired up
on the Nimitz and the Kitty Hawk.

54:37.260 --> 54:39.920
They're just waiting for your attack order,
Mr. President.

54:41.260 --> 54:43.760
And we're gonna hit
Libyan Intelligence Headquarters?

54:44.100 --> 54:47.180
The NSA confirmed they're the ones
who planned the bombing.

54:47.350 --> 54:50.440
- And what's the estimate?
- We'll level the building.

54:51.520 --> 54:56.020
Libyan I.H.Q. Looks like it's in the center
of Tripoli. What else are we going to hit?

54:56.860 --> 54:58.940
Nothing, unless we miss.

54:59.190 --> 55:02.160
- Are we gonna miss?
- No, sir.

55:04.830 --> 55:07.660
- How many people work in the building?
- We went through this.

55:07.830 --> 55:10.120
How many people working
in the damn building?

55:10.410 --> 55:13.330
I have the numbers here, Mr. President.
There are three shifts.

55:13.500 --> 55:16.960
The fewest. What shift has
the fewest people? The night shift?

55:17.340 --> 55:19.420
By far, sir. Mostly custodial staff...

55:19.590 --> 55:22.180
What time does the night shift start?

55:23.050 --> 55:24.590
They're on now, sir.

55:32.190 --> 55:33.190
A. J.?

55:34.060 --> 55:35.440
Sir, it's immediate...

55:35.610 --> 55:37.860
...it's decisive, it's low-risk...

55:38.030 --> 55:39.940
...and it's a proportional response.

55:40.610 --> 55:42.860
Someday someone's
gonna have to explain to me...

55:43.030 --> 55:45.530
...the virtue of a proportional response.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.540
Mr. President?

55:50.080 --> 55:51.480
Attack.

55:53.750 --> 55:56.960
Once our planes have cleared
Libyan airspace, you can call the press.

55:57.130 --> 55:59.460
But I don't know
when we'll have the full B.D.A.

55:59.630 --> 56:02.760
- General Rork says around 0800.
- 0800?

56:03.340 --> 56:05.510
Sir, what do you think
about a national address?

56:06.430 --> 56:09.560
Last thing I want to do
is put the Libyans center stage.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.350
Well, I think it's a great idea.

56:11.520 --> 56:15.100
You know Rumson is gonna be
talking about your lack of military service.

56:15.270 --> 56:16.900
It's not about Rumson.

56:17.060 --> 56:19.770
What I did tonight
was not about political gain.

56:19.940 --> 56:21.650
Yes, but it can be, sir.

56:21.820 --> 56:25.070
What you did tonight
was very presidential.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.600
Leon...

56:27.950 --> 56:29.700
Somewhere in Libya right now...

56:29.870 --> 56:33.250
...a janitor's working a night shift
at Libyan Intelligence Headquarters.

56:33.410 --> 56:35.920
He's going about doing his job...

56:36.080 --> 56:41.840
...because he has no idea in about an hour
he's going to die in a massive explosion.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.680
He's just going about his job...

56:46.840 --> 56:49.970
...because he has no idea
that about an hour ago...

56:50.140 --> 56:52.970
...I gave an order to have him killed.

56:54.390 --> 56:57.980
You've just seen me do
the least presidential thing I do.

57:01.730 --> 57:02.730
Mary?

57:02.900 --> 57:05.240
Is there anything
about the C-STAD system...

57:05.400 --> 57:09.620
...that could have been mistaken
as offensive rather than defensive?

57:09.870 --> 57:12.200
No. We did everything
but show them the blueprints.

57:12.370 --> 57:16.000
The hardware had been sitting in an
airplane hangar for more than a month.

57:16.170 --> 57:18.880
They didn't hit it
until the American personnel arrived.

57:19.040 --> 57:22.210
Sir, there's an unconfirmed report
that you were with Sydney Wade...

57:22.380 --> 57:24.100
...when you learned of the attack.
Comment?

57:24.300 --> 57:26.270
- Yes, we had just finished dinner.
- Get him off.

57:26.370 --> 57:27.680
Last question.

57:27.840 --> 57:30.930
Sir, would you care to comment
on your relationship?

57:31.100 --> 57:33.930
We don't have a relationship,
we just had dinner. Thank you.

57:34.100 --> 57:36.060
Did she spend the night
at the White House?

57:36.230 --> 57:39.730
Folks, a lot of people
were killed last night.

57:39.900 --> 57:42.860
Let's try to keep our eye on the ball, okay?
Thank you.

57:45.530 --> 57:47.370
That was my fault.
We should have prepped you.

57:47.490 --> 57:49.490
There's nothing that needs prepping.
A. J.?

57:49.660 --> 57:52.700
Let's meet with the leadership
after we meet the Security Council.

57:52.870 --> 57:55.240
Newsweek is begging
for 10 minutes today. Any 10.

57:55.410 --> 57:57.250
Nobody gets 10 minutes today.

57:57.790 --> 58:00.290
Tell the speaker to wait.
I want to talk to him.

58:00.460 --> 58:02.790
No, I'll be right down.

58:02.960 --> 58:05.510
Last night,
the cost of those liberal programs...

58:05.670 --> 58:10.130
...was raised to include
the blood of 22 American soldiers.

58:10.300 --> 58:11.800
Mr. Shepherd's read a lot of books...

58:11.970 --> 58:16.100
...but it doesn't take a Harvard degree to
see this one coming a mile down the road.

58:16.270 --> 58:18.640
I went to Stanford, you blowhole.

58:18.810 --> 58:21.650
He has never served one day in uniform.

58:23.230 --> 58:25.110
This box just says "miscellaneous."

58:25.280 --> 58:26.730
Is it bedroom miscellaneous...

58:26.900 --> 58:29.070
...or kitchen miscellaneous?

58:30.740 --> 58:34.620
- Sydney?
- Why did I have to kiss him?

58:35.580 --> 58:38.250
- You kissed him?
- Yeah.

58:39.580 --> 58:41.330
- You didn't tell me.
- I kissed him.

58:41.500 --> 58:43.540
- Where?
- On the mouth.

58:43.710 --> 58:46.630
- Where in the White House?
- In the Dish Room.

58:46.800 --> 58:49.920
- The "Dish Room"?
- The China Room.

58:50.090 --> 58:52.090
And then what happened?

58:52.260 --> 58:54.970
- He had to go and attack Libya.
- It's always something.

58:55.140 --> 58:59.310
Yeah, I gotta nip this in the bud.
This has "catastrophe" written all over it.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.020
In what language?

59:01.190 --> 59:03.480
Sydney, the man is the leader
of the free world.

59:03.650 --> 59:07.190
He's brilliant, he's funny, he's handsome,
he's an above-average dancer.

59:07.360 --> 59:11.450
Isn't it possible
our standards are just a tad high?

59:17.950 --> 59:19.080
Answer the phone.

59:19.250 --> 59:20.620
- It's him.
- Answer the phone.

59:20.790 --> 59:22.120
He's gonna ask me come over.

59:22.290 --> 59:23.750
- Answer.
- I don't want to go.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.920
Answer the phone.

59:25.090 --> 59:27.420
All right.
But I'm gonna end it on the phone.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.630
Uh, I just came over to tell you
why I can't see you anymore.

59:34.390 --> 59:36.850
Come on in. Thanks, Coop.

59:40.140 --> 59:41.890
Uh, look, I know you've had a tough day.

59:42.060 --> 59:45.520
Not as tough as some. Want a drink?
Let me take your coat.

59:45.690 --> 59:47.900
Mr. President, this isn't gonna work.

59:48.070 --> 59:51.780
- Sure it will. Button the top button...
- That's not what I mean.

59:51.950 --> 59:55.360
- I didn't think it was.
- I've really enjoyed our time together...

59:55.530 --> 59:57.950
...this has "catastrophe"
written all over it.

59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.950
Please, Mr. President, don't pursue me
outside the political arena.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.870
I have no intentions of pursuing you
inside of it...

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.130
...and that leaves everything out
and that's unacceptable to me.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.630
If I were on your staff...

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.510
...I'd tell you that the worst thing
you can do, coming into an election year...

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.050
...is open yourself to character attacks.
The quickest way to do that...

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.660
...is to prance around like the playboy
of the Western World.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:24.020
Let's clear up a couple of things here.
Number one, I seldom prance.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.270
Number two, I have no intention
of engaging in a character debate.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.360
- Number three, you're not on my staff.
- But if you'll follow the immutable...

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.150
Why is that, by the way? Please.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.370
- Why is what?
- Why aren't you on my staff?

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.280
- You can't afford me.
- How much do you make?

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:41.950
More than you do, Mr. President.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.620
The name is Andy.
How much money do you make?

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.710
What does it matter how much I make?

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.710
You raise your voice to the president?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.670
Ugh, I'm only thinking
about the health of your presidency.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.880
You know this morning's press conference
won't be the end of this.

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.390
Bob Rumson's gotta be
drooling over this.

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.180
Are you attracted to me?

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:04.310
- I beg your pardon?
- I asked if you were attracted to me.

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.560
That's not the issue.

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:09.270
Tell you what. Let's make it the issue.
Let's try something new...

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.610
...because when most couples
first get together, they're inclined...

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.530
...to slam on the brakes because they're
concerned about Bob Rumson's drool.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.320
- You're not most people.
- You know what your problem is?

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:20.530
What's my problem?

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:23.330
Sex and nervousness.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.540
- Sex and nervousness is my problem?
- Yes.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:30.170
Last night when we were looking
at those place settings in the Dish Room...

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:33.500
...I realized those place settings
were provided by the first ladies.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:36.010
I'll bet none of those first ladies...

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:40.470
...were nervous about having sex
with their president husbands.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.140
And you know why?

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:45.680
- No, but I'm sure you'll explain it to me.
- I will.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.060
Because they weren't presidents
when they first met them.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.230
That's not the case here.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:53.940
- Ah.
- You see what I'm getting at?

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.110
Yes.

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:01.120
- May I use your bathroom for a moment?
- Right through there. Right behind you.

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.490
I just want to freshen up.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.540
As you pass through,
you'll see a large closet on the right.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.710
If you want, hang up your coat.

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.460
Then I'll fix us a drink...

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:14.170
...we'll sit on the couch,
and I'll explain to you my plan.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.010
You got a plan?
Don't make me wait. You're on a roll.

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:19.470
Okay, you're attracted to me...

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.470
...but the idea of physical intimacy
is uncomfortable...

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.310
...because you only know me
as the president.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.220
It's not always going to be that way.

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.770
The reason I know that is
there was a moment last night...

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:34.480
...when you were with me
and not the president.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.030
And I know what a big step
that was for you.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.950
So, Sydney, I'm in no rush.

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:43.990
Here's my plan.
We're gonna slow down...

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.540
...and when you're comfortable,
that's when it's gonna happen.

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:02.130
Perhaps I didn't properly explain
the fundamentals of the slowdown plan.

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.800
No, you explained it great.

01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.930
Are you nervous?

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.100
- No.
- Good.

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.440
My nervousness exists on several levels.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:20.030
Number one,
and this is in no particular order:

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.820
I haven't done this in a pretty long time.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.030
Number two, uh:

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.660
Any expectations that you might have,
given the fact that I'm, you know...

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.080
- The most powerful man in the world.
- Exactly, thank you.

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:38.000
Remember that it's a political distinction
that comes with the office.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:42.840
I mean, if, uh, Eisenhower were here
instead of me he'd be dead by now.

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:45.140
- And number three...
- Andy.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.850
Does New Hampshire want...

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:51.730
...traditional American values
back in the White House?

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.440
Does New Hampshire
want the pride back?

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.450
My name is Bob Rumson,
and I'm running for president.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.130
Yeah. Ahem.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.880
Put him through.

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:29.810
Lewis, it is 5 a.m.
You've got to get yourself a life, man.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720
Yeah.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.310
All right.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.860
- Sydney.
- Hi.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.660
Uh, what are you doing?

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.990
Uh, I wanted to leave the building
before the press corps got here.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:55.000
I have those same thoughts
every day of my life.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.080
You know Lewis Rothschild, don't you?

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:01.550
Sure. Boy, Lewis would go nuts
if he knew I spent the night.

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:03.960
- Well, he's on his way up.
- What?

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.340
Come on in, Lewis.

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:08.680
Morning, Mr. President. Hi, Sydney.

01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.600
Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President...

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.390
Uh, thanks for taking the time
to go over those fossil-fuel numbers.

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.360
I'll just get my coat, be on my way.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.150
- So, what's the situation?
- Camped out at every exit.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320
Who? Who's camped out?

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.650
- The press.
- The press is camped out?

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.950
You should have taken a cab.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.040
- They know my car?
- Good morning, Sydney.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.330
- I came as soon as Lewis called.
- Oh, thank God.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.500
Let's not look like we're panicking.

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.870
See, the important thing is
actually not to be panicking.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.960
- Morning, Mr. President.
- Morning.

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.460
- Morning, Miss Wade.
- Hello.

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:45.760
I see everyone's getting
an early start today.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:49.260
How do we exit Sydney from the building
and, uh, what do we say to the press?

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:51.510
- We need a diversion.
- A diversion?

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.180
I'm not suggesting
that we burn the White House.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.890
Oh, please, let's do.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.730
I state clearly that I can't be party
to anything illegal.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.100
Good for you.

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:03.020
It's always the guy in my job
who ends up doing 18 months...

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.980
...in a minimum security prison.

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.650
- Rest easy. We won't create a diversion.
- No diversion.

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.780
- Somebody will take you home.
- Esther's over in my office.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:14.580
- She has the station wagon standing by.
- Good. Now, press statement.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.000
Sydney...

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.540
When you leave here, you're gonna run
into reporters and photographers.

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.880
They're gonna take your picture every day.
They're gonna ask you questions every day.

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:27.590
Answer them, don't answer them,
it's entirely up to you.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:33.100
The White House has no official position
except to say, "No comment."

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.510
- No comment?
- The White House does not comment...

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.270
...on the president's personal life.
- We can't leave it at that.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.560
I tell you what, Lewis. We just did.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.440
- But, sir...
- Thank you, Mr. President.

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:45.480
Come, friends. Let us away.

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:48.070
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.360
Sydney. Esther will be in my office.

01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:52.870
- Take your time.
- Thanks, A.J.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.160
Heh, I'm sorry about this.

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.000
We'll do it better next time.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:05.040
I'm no expert, but I thought we did it
pretty good this time.

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.090
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I know.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.220
I had a good time.

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:14.140
Me too. I'll call you.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.810
- I'll be in Panama, but I'll call you.
- I'd like that.

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:19.170
Great.

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:22.650
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:35.160
All right. Okay. This is good.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.660
What about an incentive program?

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.160
Sydney Ellen Wade,
the political strategist...

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:44.540
...who accompanied President Shepherd
to last week's state dinner...

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:47.750
...spent the night at the White House
as a guest to the president.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.380
The president returned
from Panama this evening...

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.130
...after a three-day tour
through Central America.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.760
His first order of business:

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:58.930
An intimate dinner with Sydney Wade
at a romantic Georgetown bistro.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.520
Conservative and religious
family organizations...

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.770
...are starting to smell blood
in the water...

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.520
...as the polling numbers
of the president are dropping.

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.190
Can you tell us how they met?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.690
Showbiz Weekly
was in Hollywood for the star-studded gala.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:16.120
Also on tonight's program,
Day 15 of the Sydney Watch.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:19.029
Is the world's most eligible bachelor
off the market?

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.450
All right. Next caller, you're on the air.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.290
What about Lucy Shepherd?

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.670
Is anyone concerned about this little girl?

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.920
Can we now finally have a serious debate
about family values?

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:32.010
- Americans can no longer...
- Political analyst, Ed Earl.

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:35.050
With the president's job approval
taking an eight-point dip...

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.050
...from his personal best
of 63 percent three weeks ago...

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.060
...should the White House be concerned
that the girlfriend...

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.729
...has left Shepherd vulnerable
to the questions...

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:45.600
...he was able to avoid three years ago?

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.350
They sure ought to be concerned.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.649
How much
will this new wrinkle affect his ability...

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:52.540
...to put together a win on his crime bill?

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.450
We'll take a commercial break.

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:57.990
When we come back, we'll meet a junior
high-school classmate of Sydney...

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.080
...who has some intimate details
to share.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.790
I agree with you 110 percent, Mrs. Harper.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.840
That's why I'm up here
in the dead of winter...

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.880
...talking about it with you folks.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.460
That's very generous of you.
And I'll be taking...

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:12.800
...that money off your hands right now.

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:15.050
What've you got?

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.720
Call me Santa Claus, senator.
She's got an FBI file.

01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:21.560
- Oh, shit, Stu. My mother's got an FBI file.
- Yeah, but...

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.390
...I got art.

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.189
It's a demonstration outside
the Department of Commerce.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:32.069
The picture's old and some of the faces
are obscured by the fire, but...

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.399
...that's a burning flag...

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:37.990
...and that's Sydney Ellen Wade
right there in front.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:43.370
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.399
Harry. No...

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.790
Harry. Think like a father for a second.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.590
Wouldn't you like your kids to be able
to take a deep breath when they're 30?

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.050
Thank you.

01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:59.890
You're doing the right thing.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:02.390
Tote board's heavy.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.760
How's this?

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.270
Terrell, North Carolina.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.480
Hey, Syd. I, uh, saw on your schedule...

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:14.320
...you're meeting with McSorley,
McCluskey and Shane?

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:18.320
Yeah. The Motown Three said
they'd give me 30 minutes next week.

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:20.860
Sydney, these are people
who represent people...

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.660
...who make cars for a living.

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:24.790
- Yeah?
- Cars, you understand...

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:26.500
...run on gasoline.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.830
Hey. I know it's a long shot.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.290
But if I can get one of them,
it'll be a huge payoff in visibility.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.920
If we're gonna try, we should do
some prep work. Want to, uh, order in?

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:38.590
Uh, I can't. I'm having dinner
at the White House.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.760
- Uh, so let's start early tomorrow. Say, 7:30?
- Okay.

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:44.760
I'm, uh, having lunch at the Kremlin,
so we'll have to...

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:47.180
...start even earlier than that.
- Good night.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:49.390
In order for me to catch
the plane to Moscow.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.020
Good night, David.

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:58.610
Douglas, does the NRA have videotapes
of you playing golf with Satan?

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.650
We've softened the assault weapons.

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.490
We're leaving the SKS, the Mini-14
and 250 other types on the street.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.330
I mean, how much pull
can one lobby have?

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:10.960
Uh, we'll continue
this conversation tomorrow.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm late for the party fundraiser and,
Douglas, I'll put in a good word for you.

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.420
You're incredibly late.

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:20.670
Excuse me, I spoke
with the federal mediator in St. Louis.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.220
Management walked off.
Baggage handlers, pilots...

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:26.390
...and flight attendants
are getting set to walk out in 48 hours.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.310
I studied under a Nobel-Prize-winning
economist. You know what he taught me?

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.100
- Never have an airline strike at Christmas?
- I'm going to St. Louis.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.020
- You can leave straight from the fundraiser.
- Thanks, A.J.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.650
Good luck, Mr. President.

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.860
Liberty's moving.

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:47.330
- Mr. President. Can we have a moment?
- He's incredibly late.

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.620
Hop in, we'll talk in the car.

01:11:51.330 --> 01:11:53.670
- What is it?
- We have a small problem.

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:56.130
It could've been small.
It's a medium nightmare.

01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:59.460
- It's an opportunity.
- It could have been if we'd caught it.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:01.090
- We caught it.
- At 5:45.

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.760
It doesn't do me any good.
Network news is in make-up.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:08.310
- Twelve people work for you...
- Guys, do I have to be here for this?

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:12.060
Sorry, sir. Uh, it's on the evening news,
it's buried as the third story.

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:13.730
It's got a bullet.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.020
Sydney was at a protest rally.
They burned a flag.

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:19.270
- Today?
- About 13 years ago.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.610
In front of the Department of Commerce.
Anti-apartheid.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.530
Uh, let me see if I got this.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:27.490
The third story on the news...

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.080
...was that someone I didn't know
13 years ago, when I wasn't president...

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:35.290
...went to a demonstration where no laws
were broken, in protest of something...

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:39.340
...that so many people were against,
doesn't exist anymore.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.210
Just out of curiosity,
what was the fourth story?

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.180
Right. See, I think it's important
when we deal with it...

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.090
Don't deal with it.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.850
- Excuse me?
- Trying to get us to swing at the dirt.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.100
Nobody wins these fights. It'll go away.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:57.770
Sir, I'm not sure
that's the wisest course of action.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.020
- Hell.
- It's already distracting you.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.230
No. You reminded me

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.440
I'm supposed to have dinner
with Sydney tonight.

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:08.410
Oh, it's terrific. Beth, I love it.

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:12.370
I can't believe I'm loaning you clothes.
I thought you owned everything.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.660
Well, work clothes.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:17.370
I always wear a suit at the White House.
I thought a dress would be nice.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.420
Go ahead. Try it on.
I brought earrings too.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.670
- Hello.
- Hi, what are you doing?

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.930
Uh, just trying on dresses.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:29.930
I feel terrible,
but I'll have to cancel our date tonight.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.810
- Another woman?
- Heh, no.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.020
I've gotta go to St. Louis
to avert a massive airline strike.

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.480
If I had a nickel for every time
I heard that one.

01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.490
Thanks for understanding.
I'll call you later.

01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:41.270
Okay, bye.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.650
Oh, I hate doing that.
She was trying on dresses.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.780
I tell any girl I'm going out with...

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:50.320
...to assume that all plans are soft
until she receives confirmation...

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:53.580
...30 minutes beforehand.
- And they find this romantic?

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.540
I say it with a great deal of charm.

01:13:55.710 --> 01:13:58.620
Look! There it is!
Carmen's House of Flowers.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.170
- Coop, we gotta stop.
- What?

01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:01.790
I gotta get her flowers.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.050
- Here?
- Now?

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.090
That's what men do
when they break a date.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.470
That's not what men do.
I don't know men who do that.

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:09.760
I'm gonna hop out at the flower shop.

01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:11.890
- You'll "hop out," sir?
- He's not hopping.

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:13.430
No hopping, sir.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.980
- Stay in the car. I'll get the flowers.
- It's not gonna be personal.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.400
Let them do a security sweep.
We don't know who's in there.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.110
The florist is planning an assassination
on the off-chance I might stop by?

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.690
It's possible.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.640
No, no.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.280
You're not hearing me.
Listen to what I'm saying.

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:35.120
It was at the basketball game.

01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:36.370
Excuse me.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.080
No, girl, at the game.
Kiki wasn't even there.

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:41.830
- Excuse me?
- Ha, ha. Ugh, hold on.

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.460
I will be right with you.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:47.840
I don't know if you're the one
I talked to on the phone...

01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.930
Virginia, dogwood, president...

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:54.140
Does any of this ring a bell?

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:56.350
Same girl, she remembered me.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.350
I'm glad to see
that the president has a girlfriend.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.980
Never mind...

01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:07.230
...that she's the hired gun of an
ultra-liberal political action committee.

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:10.450
Never mind...

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.860
...that the president takes the 5th...

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:17.450
...any time a reporter has the temerity
to ask him a question about a woman...

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.790
...in a position
to exert enormous influence...

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.500
...over a huge range of issues.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.550
Never mind that this woman's idea of how
to unwind at the end of a tough day...

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.260
...is to get together with her ACLU pals...

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:34.800
...and to set American flags on fire.

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.430
No reaction from the White House.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.650
It doesn't need to be dignified
with a response.

01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:46.270
There's no upside. I'm leaving it alone.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.190
What do Lewis and Robin think?

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.280
Brutus and Cassius, heh?

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:53.200
They want me to get into
a character debate and mix it up.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.660
Lewis and Robin are very smart.

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:58.790
- Sydney says you guys are really stupid.
- I didn't say that.

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:02.250
- She's questioning your loyalty.
- I question it all the time.

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.170
Wait a minute.
Here comes my favorite part.

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:09.630
My name is Bob Rumson
and I'm running for president.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:14.260
Glad he cleared that up because the crowd
was about to buy some Amway products.

01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.300
His numbers are climbing.

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:18.600
Sydney, his numbers
have nowhere to go but up.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.560
What about yours?

01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:24.190
Ugh, we'll be back up in the 60s
once I get the votes for the crime bill.

01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:25.790
So, what are you doing this weekend?

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.110
Uh, I've got work
I was going to bring home. Why?

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.070
Well, negotiations are going pretty well.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.110
Looks like the nation's
going to keep on flying and, uh...

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.780
...Lucy's spending Saturday night
at a friend's house.

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:38.490
What do you have in mind?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.580
You ever been to Camp David?

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.830
Camp David. Sure.
I used to go there all the time...

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.460
...but then they changed chefs and I...

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:53.670
It's sass, right? You're sassing me.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.380
Ha, ha, yes.

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.300
I'm gonna have somebody pick you up
on Saturday morning.

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:00.470
Okay. Bye.

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:01.850
Bye.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.030
- Mm, good God.
- What?

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.700
I'm looking at your college
transcripts. This isn't human.

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:26.830
Nobody gets this many A's.
You were like a Stepford student. Ha, ha.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Still reading that ridiculous biography?

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.710
No. I finished
Shepherd: Road to the White House.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.340
Now I'm on to
Shepherd: The Early Years.

01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:37.340
Seven trillion dollar
communication system at my disposal...

01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:42.760
...and I can't find out if the Packers won.
- Oh, Andy. C-minus in Women's Studies.

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.010
That course wasn't about...

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.340
...what I thought it was going to be about.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.810
President Shepherd
was in Maryland this week...

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.690
...for his routine physical exam.

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:56.400
Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital
pronounced him in excellent health.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:18:00.120
Who cares? Just give us the scores.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.330
While the president
spent the day at Camp David...

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:04.870
...GOP presidential hopeful...

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.210
...Robert Rumson, continued his attacks
on President Shepherd's character.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:13.460
During the Saturday news program,
Capitol Review with Kenneth Michaels...

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:15.510
...Senator Rumson suggested that...

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:18.090
...GDC political director,
Sydney Ellen Wade...

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.050
...whose close personal relationship
with the president...

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.100
...has caused the White House headaches
for two months...

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:29.390
...may have traded sexual favors for key
votes in the Virginia State Legislature...

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.610
...while lobbying for
the Virginia Teachers Association.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.690
- That's a heck of an accusation to make...
- I'm not saying...

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.700
Let me be very clear.
I'm not making an accusation.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.990
I am saying, when you hear one thing,
you dismiss it.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.490
You hear two, you dismiss it.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.540
But when several, several well-respected
members and former members...

01:18:49.710 --> 01:18:52.670
- ...of the Virginia State Legislature...
- Can you give us names?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.380
- He's making this up as he goes along.
- I'm so sorry, Sydney.

01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:59.050
I don't know what we call her.
The First Mistress?

01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:02.010
Oh, man. My father heard that.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.390
He's just gonna have to turn a deaf ear.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.680
My father doesn't have a deaf ear.
He hears fine out of both.

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.730
So do I and so does my sister
and so does my friends.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.150
You're the only one who...

01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:15.690
I can't challenge a school bully to a fight
because he picks on my girlfriend.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:20.650
I'm not asking you to. I can take care
of myself. It's not about me.

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:22.910
How can you keep quiet?

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:26.120
How do you have patience for people
who claim to love America...

01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:28.540
...but clearly can't stand Americans?

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:34.460
I have one election left. I don't have
the luxury of losing my patience.

01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:42.010
I, um... I want to say something to you
but I'm going to fumble it a little bit.

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.100
So, please, just wait till I'm done
before you respond.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.100
I'm in love with you. I'm certain of it.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:54.480
And I want to be with you
more than anything...

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:59.280
...but maybe things would be better for you
if I just disappeared for a while.

01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:04.070
Things will be better
when I pass the crime bill.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.410
And if you disappeared...

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.280
...I'd find you.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.500
- Hi, Gil.
- Mr. President...

01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:22.760
Um, Mr. President, militant women are out
to destroy college football in this country.

01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:24.550
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.390
Have you been following
the situation down in Atlanta?

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:33.180
No. Uh, these women want parity
for girls' softball, volleyball, field hockey...

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:37.150
If I'm not mistaken, the courts
ruled on Title IX about 20 years ago.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:41.030
Yes, sir, but what I'm saying now is
these women want that law enforced.

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:43.190
- It's a world gone mad.
- It is, sir.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:45.110
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.410
Come meet some people.

01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:49.370
You see, the country has mood swings.

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:50.740
- Mood swings?
- Yeah.

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:54.500
Nineteen postgraduate degrees
in math and your best explanation...

01:20:54.670 --> 01:20:58.080
...for going from a 63 to 46 percent
approval rating in five weeks...

01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:59.380
...is mood swings?

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:03.300
Well, I could explain it better,
but I'd need charts, graphs and an easel.

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.720
Fellas, we haven't slept in three years.

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:09.430
Can't we forget about work for one night
and enjoy each other as friends?

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.720
- It's Christmas.
- It's Christmas?

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:13.890
Yeah. You didn't get the memo?

01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:21.360
- Sydney. Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Esther, hi.

01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:22.730
Hello, Sydney.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.070
Merry Christmas, A.J.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.570
And a merry Christmas to you.
Where have you been?

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.200
I got stuck on Dupont Circle.

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:33.580
I can never remember which lane
I'm supposed to take.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.960
Then I got cut off by
this idiot cab driver...

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.080
...who starts screaming at me
that it's my fault.

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:39.500
Come on, it's Christmas.

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:42.250
Hi, Syd. Did you get stuck
on Dupont Circle again?

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.550
It's not funny. I hate that place.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.260
Can't you declare it
a federal disaster area?

01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:51.220
- I'll look into it.
- What were you doing up on the hill?

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.720
Oh, I had a terrible meeting today.

01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.310
I totally lost my cool
with McSorley, McCluskey and Shane.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.230
Heh, you went up to see
the Motown Three?

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.480
I pitched them the bill.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:03.230
- On its merits?
- The woman has no fear.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.740
She'd lobby the Carolinas
for the American Lung Association.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.030
- It was a disaster.
- You're in good company.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.530
I sat with them. They said there was
nothing on the domestic agenda...

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.660
...they were more committed to defeating
than the crime bill.

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.660
Well, congratulations, fellas.

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:20.880
Because McSorley told me
the only thing on the domestic agenda...

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.260
...that they were more committed to
defeating was the fossil-fuel package.

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:27.880
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:30.260
It's funny, that he used the same words.

01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:32.640
Yeah, Pep Boys don't know
too many words.

01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:36.470
I'm gonna get a drink and shake this off.
Then I'll have some Christmas spirit.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640
Okay.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.560
Are you okay?

01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:42.440
I'm fine, yeah. Heh, I'm fine.

01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:45.400
- Come on, I'll lead the way.
- Thank you.

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:49.360
- Merry Christmas, Mr. President.
- Happy holidays, Bob.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:51.990
Did what I think just happened
just happen?

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.740
Did the GDC's political director tell
the president and the chief of staff...

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:58.660
...that three votes on the crime bill
can be bought...

01:22:58.830 --> 01:23:00.870
...by sticking the fossil-fuel package
in a drawer?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.750
No, GDC's political director
didn't tell us anything.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:07.760
Sydney Wade told her boyfriend and
his best friend that she had a lousy day.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.090
It doesn't change the facts,
Mr. President.

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.930
If Sydney gets her 24 votes and we're three
votes shy, there's maneuvering to be done.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.720
- I made a promise.
- You made a deal.

01:23:16.890 --> 01:23:18.890
- I made it with Sydney.
- With the GDC.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.440
It's all academic.
We won't need those three votes.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.570
Sir, if your approval rating continues
to drop, things are going to get tight.

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:33.360
I've been hearing rumors that your boss
is wavering on the crime bill.

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:36.330
Heh, I wouldn't listen to rumors.
You know this town.

01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:38.160
That's what I wanted to hear.

01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:41.790
I'll tell you, my boss is starting to waver
on the crime bill.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.290
Sydney, everybody cares about
the environment during a phone survey.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:51.220
On election day, nobody gives a damn.
That's, uh... That's why you have a job.

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.090
Congressman, on election day...

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.300
...people give a damn about what I tell them
to give a damn about.

01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:57.600
That's why I have a job.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.140
She got Pennybaker.

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:05.150
- It was our understanding
we had your support.

01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.110
Look, I like you, boy. Always have.

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.190
But for God's sake,
does the woman have to spend the night?

01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:14.360
We've got the full backing
of the White House, Katherine.

01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:16.490
Yes, at 20 percent.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.620
Three more votes.
The president sends it to the Hill.

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.330
Katey, Katey...

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.540
Ten years from now, any car with an internal
combustion engine will be a collectible.

01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:29.170
Come onboard.
We'll make your Volvo a classic.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.420
Congressman,
the assault weapons are gone.

01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:33.010
The bill is priced to move.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:36.010
The bill isn't the issue.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.930
I'm facing a serious challenge
in November.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.640
The president's coattails aren't
what they used to be.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:45.310
The president's coattails will have room
for you. You just leave that to us.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.360
We left that to you
and now the president's in a free fall.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.900
- I wouldn't say he's in a free fall...
- Fellas.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:53.440
I just can't give you my vote.

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:57.660
A.J., the well is drying up. He's gotta make
a move or we'll die fast and quiet.

01:24:57.830 --> 01:25:00.120
So, what if I do
a detailed, public-opinion poll?

01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.580
- And we put Sydney in the new model.
- Right.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.710
A.J., it's meaningless
unless we ask them about Sydney.

01:25:09.340 --> 01:25:11.380
All right, fine. Let's do it.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.720
Mm. Mm. Oh!

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.650
It's delicious. Thank you.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.410
- Is there any more?
- Tons. I didn't think you liked it.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.660
You kidding? Of course, I did.

01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:45.750
It's not for me. The agent who checked
the food thought it was delicious too.

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:47.290
I told him I'd bring him some.

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:50.210
- So you didn't like it.
- No, I loved it.

01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.920
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:55.630
I can tell when you're holding something
back. You do a thing with your face.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.340
When have you ever seen me
do a thing with my face?

01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:00.140
Two days before I met you.

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:04.560
You gave a speech for the Daughters
of the American Revolution. I was there.

01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:06.680
- You were?
- You remember the speech?

01:26:06.850 --> 01:26:07.890
Vaguely.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.400
"Americans can no longer afford to pretend
they live in a great society."

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:12.610
Ah, yes.

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:16.280
- There was supposed to be something after.
- How did you know that?

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.950
I've told you, the face.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.330
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:29.830
Ooh, wow! Mm.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.460
What's the occasion?

01:26:31.630 --> 01:26:34.750
You're looking at a lady
who's two votes shy of the promised land.

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.010
- Two votes?
- I got Pennybaker.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:41.090
- That got me Cass and Zimmer.
- That's great. That's great work, Sydney.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.470
Well, I'm not there, yet.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.850
No matter what happens, you have
every reason to be proud of yourself.

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.520
No, I'll be proud
when I see you sign the bill.

01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:50.850
Well, yeah.

01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:53.020
Andy...

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.690
You're doing that thing with your face.

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:01.950
How are the numbers?

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.570
- Bad.
- How bad?

01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.660
Forty-one. Character, across the board.

01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:07.830
Oh, come on, George, don't tell me that!

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.370
- Who is Lewis on with?
- Jarrett.

01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:12.230
Trying to keep his fingers in the dam.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.340
You're supposed to be
a United States' Congressman.

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:20.420
But we're not gonna stay at 41.
The numbers are gonna go back up.

01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:22.430
But they're gonna go back up.

01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:25.300
All right, George... Congressman.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.310
Congressman Jarrett...
Look, George, listen to me.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.770
It's crunch time. It's personal.

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:34.900
This is one of those moments.
It's just you and the president.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:37.190
Now, what's it going to be?

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:41.070
Yeah.

01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:45.990
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Can I tell you something?

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.040
We're gonna win this thing.
We'll get the votes and we'll win.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.120
You know what I'm gonna do
that very night?

01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:53.460
I'll go to Sam and Harry's
and order a big steak...

01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:56.150
...and make a list of everybody
who tried to fuck us this week!

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.270
- Lewis!
- Yeah, well, just vote your conscience...

01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:00.590
...you chicken-shit lame-ass!

01:28:03.090 --> 01:28:04.390
We lost Jarrett.

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:09.310
I hope so. If that was an undecided,
then we need to work on our people skills.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.850
Yeah, hi, Karen, it's Lewis.

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.900
I need you to find Congressman Quincy
for me right away.

01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:19.440
We lost Quincy too.

01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:24.200
Did he give a reason?

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:27.330
Yeah, he thinks your numbers
aren't likely to rebound.

01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:31.950
We're three votes down again, sir.

01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:37.500
Mr. President, as of this morning,
Sydney only needed one more vote.

01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:39.710
The Motown Three
have gotta be scared blind.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.380
I don't think there will be
a better opportunity.

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:46.260
The press expects an announcement
on the crime bill by the State of the Union.

01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:49.350
If you agree to stick 455 in the drawer
until after the elections...

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:53.100
- ...they'll give you the three votes.
- And we declare victory, sir.

01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:57.270
We said, "as a last resort."

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.230
We're there, sir.
State of the Union is 48 hours away.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.940
- There must be three votes someplace.
- There isn't.

01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:05.400
- Bullshit! There's gotta be.
- There isn't.

01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:06.950
- Storch.
- Beg your pardon?

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.120
- What about Storch?
- No, Storch is a "no."

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.830
Mr. President...

01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:12.830
- Wagner?
- No.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.870
- Sobel? Clark?
- No. No.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.790
Not that Clark. The one from Indiana.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.540
That one too, sir.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.840
Mr. President.
I think we have to do this.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.920
A.J., she is one vote away.

01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:27.970
It's important legislation that
for the first time has a legitimate chance.

01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:31.180
- She deserves every opportunity.
- "She"?

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.770
You meant "it," didn't you, sir?

01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:36.810
"The legislation" deserves
every opportunity.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.810
- Lewis, shut up.
- You have something to say to me, Lewis?

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.360
Respectfully, sir...

01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.110
We should examine the new poll
for something more...

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.070
- They don't like me going out with Sydney?
- It's not that simple.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.410
I think this poll brings a murky problem
into specific relief.

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:55.450
Whose problem are we talking about,
Lewis? Yours?

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:57.460
You worried about losing your job?

01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:00.250
Because this poll
isn't talking about my presidency.

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:02.920
This poll is talking about my life!

01:30:03.710 --> 01:30:07.880
- Two hundred sixty-four million people...
- They don't give a damn about your life.

01:30:08.050 --> 01:30:10.720
- They give a damn about their own!
- All right, that's enough.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.390
Mr. President...

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.430
You raised a daughter...

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:18.270
...almost entirely on your own...

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.940
...and she's terrific.

01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:24.690
So, what does it say to you, that in the past
seven weeks, 59 percent of this country...

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.190
...has begun to question
your family values?

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.950
- The president doesn't answer to you.
- Oh, yes, he does. I'm a citizen.

01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.700
This is my president.

01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:37.370
In this country, it's not only permissible to
question our leaders, it's our responsibility.

01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:40.790
But you already know that,
don't you, Mr. President?

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:44.920
Because you have a deeper love of this
country than any man I've ever known.

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:48.550
And I want to know what it says to you
that in the past seven weeks...

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:51.800
...59 percent of Americans
have begun to question your patriotism?

01:30:51.970 --> 01:30:54.720
- If people want to listen...
- They don't have a choice!

01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:57.850
Bob Rumson is the only one
doing the talking.

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:01.440
People want leadership.
In the absence of genuine leadership...

01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:04.360
...they'll listen to anyone
who steps up to the microphone.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:07.070
They want leadership.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.150
They're so thirsty for it,
they'll crawl through the desert...

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:13.200
...and if there's no water,
they'll drink the sand.

01:31:15.370 --> 01:31:18.540
Lewis, we have had presidents
who were beloved...

01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:23.170
...who couldn't find a coherent sentence
with two hands and a flashlight.

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:27.590
People don't drink the sand
because they're thirsty.

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.800
They drink the sand
because they don't know the difference.

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.480
Mr. President...

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:43.810
What do you want to do about 455?

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:49.190
Make the deal.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.900
Yes, sir.

01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:57.540
I just want to go on record and apologize
for my attitude towards you...

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.660
...since your arrival.
- I didn't notice. Was there an attitude?

01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:04.960
Well, I think that, uh...
That I have a lot of pent-up hostility...

01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:07.550
...and I'm wondering
who I should blame that on.

01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:09.510
I'm not qualified to...

01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.550
I've been blaming it on my mother
and my ex-husband...

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.100
...and, well, that doesn't seem to work.
- Syd. Leo needs to see you.

01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:21.020
- Well, tell him to get in here. It's a party.
- He needs to see you in his office.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.690
It can't wait?

01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:26.610
He just got off the phone with Maclnerney.
There's been a development.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.240
Good evening.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.790
Sounds good.

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.250
- It's progressive.
- I'll say.

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.880
Dad, what's wrong with Sydney?
Did you have a fight?

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:54.090
What do you mean?

01:32:54.260 --> 01:32:56.470
- She seemed pretty mad.
- You saw her?

01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:58.260
- Yeah, she's here.
- Where?

01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:00.970
In your room. Dad, why's she mad?

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.850
Don't worry about it, honey.

01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.270
- Were you a dork?
- Practice your music.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.560
If you were a dork,
you should say you're sorry.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.190
Girls like that.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.400
Syd?

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.110
Did you see a gray cable-knit sweater?

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.320
Gray sweater? No.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.030
I called you at the office today.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.240
It's Beth's. I wore it here one time.
I didn't wanna leave it.

01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:24.500
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home. Then to Hartford.

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:27.420
- Connecticut?
- Yes. Did it go with your dry cleaning?

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.920
What's in Connecticut?

01:33:29.130 --> 01:33:31.880
Uh, Richard Reynolds' campaign.
He may be able to get a job.

01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:33.880
When did you decide to get a new job?

01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:36.930
Not long after Solomon fired me
from my old one.

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.300
- Beth's gonna kill me.
- Why did he fire you?

01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:44.230
Oh, total failure to achieve
any of the objectives for which I was hired.

01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:46.190
I told him he was being unreasonable.

01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:51.020
After all, I did dance with the president
and ride in Air Force 1 a couple of times...

01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:54.240
...but those prickly environmentalists.
There's always something.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.320
If it's not clean air, it's clean water.

01:33:56.490 --> 01:33:59.320
Like it's not enough
that I'm on the cover of People Magazine.

01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:00.950
I'll call him.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.330
You'll call him? You'll call him yourself?

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.660
It will come from the president?

01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:08.920
That's a great idea.
You should call Leo and make a deal.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.290
He hires me back for 72 days.

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:13.340
I go around scaring Congress...

01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:17.340
...making them think the president will
drive through a damaging and costly bill.

01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:21.050
They'll believe me because
I'm the president's Friday-night girl.

01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.270
I don't know if we can dip into
that well twice. I've lost all credibility.

01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:28.560
But you never know.
I might be able to pull it off again.

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:30.850
I might give you the leverage you need...

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.730
...to pass some ground-breaking piece
of crime legislation.

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:37.490
A mandatory three-day waiting period
before a 5-year-old can buy an Uzi.

01:34:37.650 --> 01:34:40.950
Fuck the sweater. She'll have to learn
to live with disappointment.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.910
What do you think went on here today?

01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:47.830
I know exactly what went on here today.
I got screwed.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.080
You saw the poll,
you needed the crime bill.

01:34:50.250 --> 01:34:52.750
You couldn't get it on your own,
so I got screwed.

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.920
The environment got screwed, Sydney.
Nothing happened to you.

01:34:57.090 --> 01:34:59.630
Governing is choosing.
Governing is prioritizing.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.220
I made no secret of the fact
the crime bill was my top priority.

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:06.720
Well, then congratulations.
It's only taken you three years...

01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:10.730
...to put together crime-prevention
legislation that won't prevent crime.

01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.600
Syd, please.

01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:15.770
I don't want to lose you over this.

01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:20.240
Mr. President, you've got bigger problems
than losing me.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:23.280
You just lost my vote.

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:32.750
What's in Hartford?

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:36.250
Richard Reynolds' district office.
She might run his campaign.

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:37.920
Twelve in the corner.

01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:41.930
Hartford, the insurance capital
of the world.

01:35:42.090 --> 01:35:44.640
Have a good time, Syd.

01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:49.350
I'll have Janie clear your schedule for
the weekend. You need to get some rest.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.890
- You handling me? Good.
- No, sir.

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:55.440
But I will if you don't start
taking your head out of your ass.

01:35:56.610 --> 01:36:00.280
- Excuse me?
- Lewis is right. Go after this guy.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.490
- Has he lied?
- What?

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:07.950
- Has Rumson lied in the past seven weeks?
- Has he lied?

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:11.290
Other than not knowing the difference
between Harvard and Stanford...

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.040
...has he said something
that isn't true?

01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:17.290
Am I not a commander in chief
who's never served in the military?

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:21.720
Am I not opposed to a constitutional
amendment banning flag burning?

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.090
Am I not an unmarried father
sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist...

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.350
...down the hall from his daughter?
- You think you're wrong?

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.640
You don't win by telling 59 percent of them
that they are.

01:36:31.810 --> 01:36:35.690
"We fight the fights we can win"?
You fight the fights that need fighting!

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.770
Is the view pretty good
from the cheap seats, A. J.?

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:40.280
I beg your pardon?

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.410
Because it occurs to me that in 25 years
I've never seen your name on a ballot.

01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:47.830
Now, why is that?
Why are you always one step behind me?

01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:51.250
If I wasn't, you'd be
the most popular history professor...

01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:53.000
...at the University of Wisconsin.

01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:55.290
Fuck you!

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:02.170
Have Lewis put the final draft...

01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:05.550
...of the State of the Union
on my desk in the morning.

01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:07.800
Yes, sir.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.520
If Mary hadn't died...

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.070
...would we have won three years ago?

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.700
Would we have won?

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:32.450
If we had to go through a character debate
three years ago...

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.540
...would we have won?

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:37.120
I don't know.

01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:41.420
But I would have liked that campaign.

01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:44.340
If my friend, Andy Shepherd,
had shown up...

01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:47.050
...I would have liked that campaign
very much.

01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:50.550
Yeah.

01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:52.780
Because the president feels there
is no value in this kind of character debate.

01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:55.660
Will the president respond
to Senator Rumson's question...

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:58.310
...about being a member
of the American Civil Liberties Union?

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.920
Yes, he will. Good morning. It's all right.
Please keep your seats. Good morning.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.510
For the last couple of months,
Senator Rumson has suggested...

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.020
...that being president of this country
was to a certain extent about character.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.350
Although I have not been willing
to engage in his attacks on me...

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.280
...I've been here three years
and three days...

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:29.700
...and I can tell you without hesitation...

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.530
...being president of this country...

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:36.030
...is entirely about character.

01:39:36.490 --> 01:39:37.950
For the record:

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.870
Yes, I am a card-carrying member
of the ACLU.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.210
But the more important question is:
Why aren't you, Bob?

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.340
Now, this is an organization...

01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:50.590
...whose sole purpose is to defend
the Bill of Rights.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.720
So it naturally begs the question:
Why would a senator...

01:39:53.890 --> 01:39:57.720
...his party's most powerful spokesman
and a candidate for president...

01:39:57.890 --> 01:40:01.060
...choose to reject
upholding the Constitution?

01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:05.060
Now, if you can answer that, folks,
then you're smarter than I am...

01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:09.150
...because I didn't understand it
until a few hours ago.

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:12.900
America isn't easy.

01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:18.080
America is advanced citizenship.
You've gotta want it bad...

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.450
...because it's gonna put up a fight.

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.120
It's gonna say, "You want free speech?

01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:26.380
Let's see you acknowledge a man
whose words make your blood boil...

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.050
...who's standing center stage,
advocating at the top of his lungs...

01:40:30.210 --> 01:40:33.880
...that which you would spend
a lifetime opposing at the top of yours.

01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:36.510
You want to claim this land
as the land of the free?

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.060
Then the symbol of your country
cannot just be a flag.

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.930
The symbol also has to be...

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:47.060
...one of its citizens exercising his right
to burn that flag in protest.

01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:51.030
Now, show me that, defend that,
celebrate that in your classrooms.

01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:54.860
Then you can stand up
and sing about 'the land of the free."'

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.990
I've known Bob Rumson for years and
I've been operating under the assumption...

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.700
...that the reason Bob devotes
so much energy to shouting at the rain...

01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:05.040
...was that he simply didn't get it.

01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:08.460
Well, I was wrong.
Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it.

01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:11.050
Bob's problem is that he can't sell it.

01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:14.880
We have serious problems to solve...

01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:17.720
...and we need serious people
to solve them.

01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:21.390
And whatever your particular problem is,
I promise you...

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.690
...Bob Rumson is not the least bit
interested in solving it.

01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:29.610
He is interested in two things
and two things only:

01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:33.150
Making you afraid of it,
and telling you who's to blame for it.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:36.030
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is how you win elections.

01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:39.740
You gather a group of middle-aged,
middle-income voters...

01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:42.950
...who remember with longing
an easier time. You talk to them...

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.290
...about family and American values
and character.

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:50.670
Then you wave an old photo of the
president's girlfriend, scream patriotism...

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:53.920
...tell them she's to blame
for their lot in life...

01:41:54.090 --> 01:41:56.260
...and you go on television...

01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:58.800
...and you call her a whore.

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.220
Sydney Ellen Wade
has done nothing to you, Bob.

01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:05.730
She has done nothing
but put herself through school...

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.440
...represent the interest
of public-school teachers...

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.190
...and lobby for the safety
of our natural resources.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:13.440
You want a character debate, Bob?

01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:15.110
You better stick with me...

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:18.530
...because Sydney Ellen Wade
is way out of your league.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.920
I've loved two women in my life.

01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:31.670
I lost one to cancer...

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.800
...and I lost the other
because I was so busy keeping my job...

01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:38.130
...I forgot to do my job.

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.510
Well, that ends right now.

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.470
Tomorrow morning...

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:47.640
...the White House is sending
a bill to Congress for its consideration.

01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:50.350
It's White House Resolution 455...

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.900
...an energy bill,
requiring a 20 percent reduction...

01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:57.490
...of the emission of fossil fuels
over the next 10 years.

01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.660
It is by far the most aggressive stride
ever taken...

01:43:01.950 --> 01:43:04.620
...in the fight to reverse
the effects of global warming.

01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:08.210
The other piece of legislation
is the crime bill.

01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:12.500
As of today, it no longer exists.

01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:14.290
I'm throwing it out.

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:18.380
I'm throwing it out and writing a law
that makes sense.

01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:20.840
You can't address crime prevention...

01:43:21.010 --> 01:43:23.720
...without getting rid of assault weapons
and handguns.

01:43:23.970 --> 01:43:27.060
I consider them a threat
to national security and I will go...

01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:29.100
...door-to-door if I have to...

01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:33.310
...but I'll convince Americans that I'm right
and I'm gonna get the guns.

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.940
We've got serious problems
and we need serious people.

01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:41.450
If you want to talk about character,
Bob...

01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:45.280
...you'd better come at me with more
than a burning flag and a membership card.

01:43:45.450 --> 01:43:48.830
If you want to talk about character
and American values, fine.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.830
Just tell me where and when
and I'll show up.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.040
This is a time for serious people, Bob,
and your 15 minutes are up.

01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:59.590
My name is Andrew Shepherd
and I am the president.

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.390
Well, you don't see that every day.

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.400
He's got the whole press corps asking
how to spell "erudite."

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:16.310
- Call the printer.
- We gotta rewrite the State of the Union.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.940
Every word. It's a whole new ball game.

01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:20.780
You have exactly 35 minutes.

01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:23.860
Oh, good.
I thought it was gonna be rushed.

01:44:24.490 --> 01:44:26.870
I don't want a limousine,
I don't want an escort.

01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:30.540
I want a plain ordinary,
non-bulletproof automobile.

01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:33.670
Well, somebody around here
must have a Chevy I can borrow.

01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:37.790
Well, find one and have it outside
the West Wing entrance in five minutes.

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.630
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.760
I'm going over to her house. I'm gonna
stand outside her door till she lets me in.

01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:45.840
I'm not leaving until I get her back.

01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:48.310
And how are you going to do that, sir?

01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:51.770
I haven't worked that out yet.
But I'm sure groveling will be involved.

01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:53.480
You're just gonna drive over?

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.610
I'm commander in chief
of the most powerful army in the world.

01:44:56.770 --> 01:44:59.190
You don't think I can drive 10 blocks?

01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:03.780
Just, uh, stay away from Dupont Circle.
I hear it's murder this time of day.

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:11.240
Hi, A.J.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.960
Nice to see you, Miss Wade.

01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:23.840
Well, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the Roosevelt Room...

01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:26.010
...giving Lewis oxygen.

01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:31.510
I heard your speech.

01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:37.560
I was in my car.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:42.070
It just kind of steered its way over here.

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.240
I'm glad.

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:54.830
Sydney...

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.750
I didn't decide to send 455 to the floor
to get you back.

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:04.550
And I didn't come back
because you sent 455 to the floor.

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:13.600
Mr. President, you might want to...

01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:15.890
Hi, Sydney.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:17.520
Hi.

01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:21.520
I moved Social Security up front.

01:46:21.690 --> 01:46:25.150
Mr. Leventhal at Treasury wants
two minutes. Hello, Sydney.

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.740
Mr. President? Excuse me, Miss Wade.
Miss McCall is on her way over, sir.

01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:32.740
Well, I got some...

01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:34.410
...things to do.

01:46:35.710 --> 01:46:37.210
Yes, you do.

01:46:38.710 --> 01:46:41.710
We're only a moment away
from the arrival of President Shepherd...

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.400
...and his State of the Union address.

01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:46.460
You've served on the staffs
of several past administrations.

01:46:46.630 --> 01:46:50.840
What kind of last-minute activity
is the president engaged in right now?

01:46:56.850 --> 01:47:00.020
There's something I've wanted to give you
since our first date.

01:47:00.190 --> 01:47:03.820
I've tried to do it a number of times,
but somehow I've always managed...

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.820
...to trip over my job...

01:47:06.110 --> 01:47:08.110
...but here...

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.570
...these are for you.

01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:14.580
They're beautiful.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.420
Ahem, Mr. President?

01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.080
Well, I've gotta go.

01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:24.250
Uh, should I stay here?

01:47:25.670 --> 01:47:27.260
Walk with me.

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:33.300
How'd you finally do it?

01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:35.760
Do what?

01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:39.560
Manage to give a woman flowers
and be president at the same time?

01:47:39.730 --> 01:47:43.060
Well, it turns out I've got a rose garden.

01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:47.320
- Mr. Speaker.
- Heh.

01:47:47.490 --> 01:47:50.900
The president of the United States!

01:47:51.305 --> 01:47:57.152
