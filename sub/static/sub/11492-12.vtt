00:03.379 --> 00:05.527
I hope you don't mind,
I used your toothbrush.

00:05.652 --> 00:07.215
No problem.
Where'd you use it?

00:08.668 --> 00:10.176
Nowhere your mouth hasn't been.

00:14.391 --> 00:15.807
You are so beautiful.

00:16.387 --> 00:17.387
Thank you.

00:17.649 --> 00:18.784
Your hair.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.895
Your eyes.
They're just amazing.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.255
And this body, it's just perfect.

00:24.876 --> 00:25.876
Thank you.

00:26.736 --> 00:27.736
So...

00:28.111 --> 00:30.572
Why don't I want to have sex
with you anymore?

00:31.390 --> 00:32.615
You don't?

00:32.794 --> 00:33.794
I'm sorry.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.536
It's okay. I don't want to, either.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.539
Thank God. I was feeling so guilty.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.707
Me, too!

00:40.958 --> 00:42.041
When did you know?

00:42.890 --> 00:44.049
About two weeks ago.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.429
Alan took Jake to the movies,
we did it on the deck.

00:47.368 --> 00:49.528
All I thought about was picking up
the champagne bottle

00:49.628 --> 00:51.050
and caving in your skull.

00:51.895 --> 00:53.094
Were you angry with me?

00:54.077 --> 00:56.055
It was more just a way to kill time.

00:56.619 --> 00:59.483
You know,
fantasizing if I could get away with it.

00:59.608 --> 01:00.608
Interesting.

01:00.649 --> 01:03.421
I fantasized about you having
a heart attack or getting hit by a bus.

01:04.033 --> 01:06.441
I wouldn't be a suspect,
and people would feel sorry for me.

01:07.299 --> 01:08.299
Smart.

01:09.015 --> 01:10.195
So, when did you know?

01:10.606 --> 01:12.273
It was in the limo, wasn't it?

01:13.825 --> 01:15.544
Your attention was wandering.

01:15.669 --> 01:18.203
Every time I looked up,
you were somewhere else.

01:19.123 --> 01:21.729
I hate to say it, but I was making
believe you were another woman.

01:21.854 --> 01:23.374
That doesn't mean it's over.

01:23.778 --> 01:26.377
I pretended you were the big
blue chick from <i>Avatar</i>.

01:29.668 --> 01:30.668
It's over.

01:32.243 --> 01:34.260
So, what do we do now?

01:35.135 --> 01:36.387
Part friends, I guess.

01:36.713 --> 01:37.764
I'd like that.

01:38.471 --> 01:39.974
You're welcome to spend the night.

01:40.603 --> 01:44.003
That's very sweet, but I want to get
as far away from you as I can.

01:44.128 --> 01:46.481
That's okay.
I just got <i>Avatar</i> on DVD.

01:50.006 --> 01:51.456
So, we're all good?

01:51.936 --> 01:52.936
Absolutely.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.710
All right. I'll go get dressed.

02:01.619 --> 02:03.719
You couldn't wait till I'm gone?

02:04.145 --> 02:06.045
Didn't seem to be any point.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074

02:42.196 --> 02:43.346
Online poker?

02:43.709 --> 02:45.491
Live girl-on-girl porn.

02:47.446 --> 02:48.788
Really? At 7:00 AM?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.420
It's not 7:00 AM in Copenhagen.

02:53.890 --> 02:56.176
How can you tell?
There's no windows.

03:00.609 --> 03:02.767
Me, I like to start my day
with a cup of coffee.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.976
Instant energy,
and it helps me poop.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.395
Somebody's having
the breakfast of champions.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.822
They say it's the most important meal
of the day.

03:19.124 --> 03:21.993
Tell me Courtney isn't in your bedroom
while you're looking at this.

03:22.547 --> 03:24.454
Courtney went home. We broke up.

03:25.722 --> 03:29.153
And you're trying to fill the void
and mend your broken heart at

03:29.278 --> 03:30.895
DanishMunchers.com.

03:34.626 --> 03:37.101
- Something like that.
- So, what happened?

03:37.226 --> 03:39.177
Nothing happened.
It just ran its course.

03:40.057 --> 03:41.846
That's hard to imagine.
She's so hot.

03:42.561 --> 03:43.904
Let me tell you something.

03:44.581 --> 03:46.004
For every gorgeous woman,

03:46.129 --> 03:48.020
there's a guy
who's tired of banging her.

03:49.888 --> 03:51.588
But that guy's never me.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.194
I gotta get out of the house.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.336
Maybe go to the movies.
Is Jake here?

03:57.461 --> 03:59.740
He's having a party over
at his mom's house tonight.

04:00.562 --> 04:01.908
Did I forget his birthday?

04:02.324 --> 04:04.432
It's just one
of those teenage parties.

04:04.637 --> 04:07.622
But for the record, his birthday was
six months ago, and you forgot.

04:09.566 --> 04:11.126
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.

04:12.432 --> 04:14.421
No wonder he keeps asking
to borrow my car.

04:14.807 --> 04:16.616
I'll just go to the movies
by myself.

04:16.741 --> 04:17.855
You want company?

04:17.980 --> 04:20.630
Hello? That's why
I was asking about Jake.

04:31.242 --> 04:32.494
Good morning, ladies.

04:33.929 --> 04:35.702
No masturbating in the kitchen!

04:37.772 --> 04:39.998
What do you say we go someplace
a little quieter?

04:48.624 --> 04:49.846
What ya working on?

04:49.971 --> 04:52.375
It's a jingle
for a new kids' breakfast cereal.

04:52.586 --> 04:53.996
Cool. Can I hear it?

04:54.121 --> 04:55.121
I guess.

04:55.757 --> 04:59.007
Picture this over animated
dancing monkeys and zebras.

05:00.625 --> 05:01.625
Got it.

05:04.861 --> 05:08.767
<i>Start your day with a big hooray</i>

05:09.589 --> 05:12.157
<i>Chocolate Diddlers</i>

05:14.538 --> 05:18.503
<i>Bowl of fun for everyone</i>

05:19.452 --> 05:21.744
<i>Chocolate Diddlers</i>

05:21.869 --> 05:25.604
<i>Chocolate Diddlers, Yum.</i>

05:31.535 --> 05:32.832
Well, I like the lyric.

05:34.573 --> 05:36.961
You know, it's kind of...
It's upbeat, celebratory.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.052
You know, "hooray, fun, yum".

05:40.593 --> 05:41.779
If I had a note...

05:41.904 --> 05:43.384
It would be the music.

05:44.093 --> 05:45.093
What?

05:45.967 --> 05:48.264
Well, it doesn't say,
"Yummy breakfast treat"

05:48.432 --> 05:50.943
so much as it says,
"My puppy's dead".

05:54.071 --> 05:57.273
- I've been a little down lately.
- I know. But keep workin' on it.

05:58.478 --> 06:00.777
- Well, I'm off.
- Where you going?

06:00.967 --> 06:03.297
To have drinks with Lyndsey
and a few of her friends.

06:03.422 --> 06:04.772
Have a good time.

06:05.422 --> 06:07.200
You know,
you're welcome to tag along.

06:07.657 --> 06:09.550
A couple of these women
are divorced,

06:09.675 --> 06:11.674
and got a few miles,
but they've been liposucked

06:11.799 --> 06:14.244
to within an inch of their lives,
so they present well.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.966
- That's okay, I got to work.
- You sure?

06:17.091 --> 06:19.748
For somebody like you,
it'd be shooting fish in a barrel.

06:19.873 --> 06:22.847
Although in this case, the fish would be
40-year-old, neurotic soccer moms,

06:22.972 --> 06:25.427
and the barrel would be a Bennigan's
in Encino.

06:26.092 --> 06:27.637
Sounds tempting, but I'll pass.

06:28.177 --> 06:29.177
Good night.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.726
Honestly, think more bouncy.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.445
Happy.
"I love Chocolate Diddlers, yay!"

06:38.617 --> 06:39.617
Got it.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.300
Bouncy, happy.

06:51.455 --> 06:53.278
<i>C is for chocolate.</i>

06:53.403 --> 06:54.924
<i>D is diabetes.</i>

06:55.049 --> 06:56.628
<i>Do your kids a favor</i>

06:56.753 --> 06:58.602
<i>Buy a box of Wheaties</i>

06:58.727 --> 07:01.257
<i>Chocolate Diddlers, yay!</i>

07:05.657 --> 07:07.269
That's a good day's work.

07:22.430 --> 07:23.430
Veronica.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.630
How's life treating you, Veronica?

07:26.224 --> 07:27.864
Not too bad. How about you?

07:28.562 --> 07:30.450
That depends on which answer
you want.

07:30.777 --> 07:32.377
There's more than one?

07:32.783 --> 07:35.009
I could give you
the "Everything's hunky-dory.

07:35.134 --> 07:38.010
"I live at the beach, drive a nice car,
and have a python in my pants" answer.

07:38.034 --> 07:41.544
- Or I could tell you the truth.
- You have an inchworm in your pants?

07:42.599 --> 07:44.422
No, the python part's true.

07:45.425 --> 07:47.425
So what is wrong with Charlie?

07:48.654 --> 07:50.324
All right, fine. I'll tell you.

07:50.449 --> 07:52.741
Two bourbons, straight up.
You want anything?

07:52.866 --> 07:53.866
I'm good.

07:55.022 --> 07:58.922
I'll spare you the details
of my narcissistic, soul-sucking mother,

07:59.489 --> 08:01.523
my deadbeat,
oddly effeminate brother,

08:01.691 --> 08:04.037
and the future organ donor
we call my nephew.

08:05.113 --> 08:07.713
And to bring you up to speed
on my recent romantic adventures,

08:08.053 --> 08:09.683
about this time last year,

08:09.808 --> 08:12.276
I was engaged to the greatest gal
I'd ever met.

08:13.328 --> 08:14.828
So, what went wrong?

08:15.236 --> 08:16.344
Hard to pinpoint.

08:16.469 --> 08:19.541
It could've been my drinking,
my compulsive gambling...

08:19.822 --> 08:22.085
Or it could've been me
sleeping with her best friend.

08:22.995 --> 08:25.213
I can see
why it'd be hard to pinpoint.

08:25.674 --> 08:26.874
I know, right?

08:27.760 --> 08:28.760
So, anyway,

08:28.798 --> 08:31.278
she dumped me for a nice guy,
but I got right back on the horse

08:31.358 --> 08:33.304
and married a drug-addled stripper.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.889
And that didn't work out?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.452
Not for the reasons you'd think.

08:37.577 --> 08:39.277
She was already married.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.835
So I figured maybe I'd take a break
for a while from the dating

08:43.960 --> 08:45.408
and just see hookers.

08:45.533 --> 08:46.533
Sure.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.200
I'm aware of the social stigma,

08:50.325 --> 08:53.458
but I like to think of prostitution
as trickle-down economics.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.412
Actually,
it's all kind of trickle-down.

08:55.537 --> 08:57.998
It's very Republican,
when you think about it.

08:59.297 --> 09:01.379
You know what?
I will have another drink.

09:02.971 --> 09:03.971
So anyway,

09:04.096 --> 09:06.888
I take the moral high ground and try
to break up with the 47-year-old,

09:07.013 --> 09:09.453
so I won't be tempted to hit
on her hot, 20-year-old daughter.

09:09.593 --> 09:10.593
Laudable.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.658
But surprise, surprise,
mom breaks up with me first

09:13.783 --> 09:16.996
cause she finds out I still have
feelings for this broad that stalks me.

09:17.121 --> 09:20.671
- Next, my ex gets out of prison...
- Can I stop you a sec?

09:21.100 --> 09:22.100
Sure.

09:22.725 --> 09:23.725
Thank you.

09:24.024 --> 09:25.024
For what?

09:25.436 --> 09:28.978
I came in here tonight because
I was angry at my pig of a boyfriend.

09:29.103 --> 09:32.254
But after listening to you,
I realize I was unfair to him.

09:32.379 --> 09:34.032
There's something below "pig".

09:36.348 --> 09:38.248
Well, I'm glad I could help.

09:41.396 --> 09:42.815
How's life treating you?

09:42.940 --> 09:46.340
In what universe did I not hear
everything you just said?

09:47.322 --> 09:49.172
Nobody likes an eavesdropper.

09:59.475 --> 10:02.602
Dude, your party
is a total sausage fest.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.671
You said,
"Let's not invite the girls we know.

10:05.796 --> 10:07.192
"Let's meet new girls".

10:07.317 --> 10:08.983
Exactly. So did you invite them?

10:09.152 --> 10:11.277
- Who?
- The girls we don't know.

10:11.446 --> 10:14.072
Dude, how can I invite them
if I don't know them?

10:15.767 --> 10:17.117
Good point, dude.

10:18.599 --> 10:20.249
Guess who brought beer!

10:25.210 --> 10:27.160
This is a total sausage fest.

10:28.351 --> 10:29.601
Told you, dude.

10:29.726 --> 10:32.776
Hey, gang,
there's hot <i>quesadillas</i> in the kitchen.

10:33.176 --> 10:35.176
Charlie?
What the hell are you doing here?

10:35.345 --> 10:38.346
Well, I heard Jake was having a party.
I thought I'd stop by.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.348
To hang out
with a bunch of teenagers?

10:40.977 --> 10:42.477
That occurred to me.

10:43.144 --> 10:45.603
The cabdriver
thought it was a good idea.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.619
And it's a really long drive.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.651
There's something wrong with you.
Get help.

10:51.892 --> 10:53.942
First I got to get another cab.

10:54.615 --> 10:55.615
Taxi!

10:58.406 --> 11:00.410
It was nice of him to bring beer.

11:00.681 --> 11:03.580
He's a crazy bastard,
but he's got good manners.

11:03.756 --> 11:04.756
Taxi!

11:12.096 --> 11:13.096
Knock, knock!

11:15.152 --> 11:16.259
Not a good time!

11:16.913 --> 11:19.471
Alan, you're supposed to say,
"Who's there".

11:20.441 --> 11:22.640
That's okay, I'll say it.
Who's there?

11:24.600 --> 11:25.854
Go away, Charlie.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.396
Go away Charlie who?

11:31.030 --> 11:32.734
I am very sorry. What do you want?

11:32.944 --> 11:34.466
I wanted to give you a heads-up

11:34.591 --> 11:37.244
that your ex-wife's
gonna be calling you in the morning,

11:37.509 --> 11:39.809
and it's not gonna be a pretty call.

11:44.205 --> 11:46.873
You're a saint for having sex
with my brother.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.410
- Good night.
- No, really...

11:51.671 --> 11:54.672
It's like taking a bird
with a busted wing

11:55.265 --> 11:59.015
and putting him in a shoebox
and feeding him with an eyedropper.

11:59.659 --> 12:01.616
You know he's never gonna fly,

12:01.741 --> 12:03.791
but you give it your best shot.

12:05.498 --> 12:06.798
Alan's the bird.

12:09.405 --> 12:10.522
What are you doing?

12:10.987 --> 12:12.137
Just resting.

12:14.355 --> 12:16.055
Your brother needs help.

12:16.180 --> 12:17.011
I know.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.447
And for the record,
I believe I will fly again.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.279
What do you want me to do, Judith?
He's a drunk with a lot of money...

12:31.303 --> 12:33.428
you can't control people like that.

12:34.301 --> 12:36.429
The best you can do
is stay on their good side

12:36.554 --> 12:39.377
so you can inherit their house
after they crap out their liver.

12:42.342 --> 12:44.918
As a matter of fact,
I have given it a lot of thought.

12:46.153 --> 12:49.253
Fine, I will talk to him about it.
Okay, okay, bye.

12:50.418 --> 12:52.063
Still think
you're getting the house?

12:52.252 --> 12:54.002
- What?
- Not important.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.693
- Alan?
- Yeah?

12:57.474 --> 13:00.280
- Why did I wake up in your bed?
- You passed out there.

13:01.731 --> 13:03.533
Did we break any biblical laws?

13:07.128 --> 13:09.456
No. Lyndsey and I went up
to your room.

13:09.730 --> 13:10.879
Ew, gross.

13:11.935 --> 13:13.293
You have sex in my bed?

13:13.504 --> 13:16.522
No. Actually, the romance
of the evening pretty much evaporated

13:16.647 --> 13:19.477
after you curled up at our feet like
a drunken Labrador.

13:21.412 --> 13:22.512
That's good.

13:23.075 --> 13:25.805
Let's play it safe
and take those sheets out of rotation.

13:27.898 --> 13:30.162
To put it on the record,
I'm officially telling you,

13:30.287 --> 13:32.604
on behalf of my ex-wife,
don't ever do that again.

13:32.972 --> 13:35.009
- Don't ever do what again?
- Doesn't matter.

13:35.134 --> 13:36.793
I've fulfilled my obligation.

13:38.937 --> 13:39.937
You know,

13:40.446 --> 13:43.114
I'm starting to think I'm not living up
to my full potential.

13:43.701 --> 13:44.701
Really?

13:45.108 --> 13:47.535
You think you can hump
and drink even more?

13:48.252 --> 13:49.896
No. Well, maybe.

13:51.663 --> 13:53.813
I woke up this morning
and there were...

13:54.001 --> 13:56.716
these little voices in my head
telling me to get help.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.838
<i>Get help.</i>

14:00.017 --> 14:02.763
<i>- Your brother needs help.
- I will fly again.</i>

14:04.100 --> 14:06.871
Better I realize it before
somebody has to point it out?

14:07.435 --> 14:10.600
No doubt. So, what are you gonna do
with this newfound insight?

14:10.867 --> 14:13.144
I think it might be time
to go back to my shrink.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.100
- Talk about your issues.
- Renew my prescriptions.

14:18.641 --> 14:20.043
Much more in character.

14:26.777 --> 14:28.785
- Come on in, Charlie.
- Thanks.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.623
It's been a while.
How you doing?

14:34.291 --> 14:35.333
Good. Good.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.488
Really?
You usually only come to see me

14:37.613 --> 14:41.005
when your hair's on fire
and someone's chasing you with gasoline.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.758
That almost happened to me once.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.969
Thank God I was able to pee
on the matches.

14:46.951 --> 14:48.054
What's going on?

14:48.574 --> 14:51.343
Well, I just recently broke up
with this terrific gal,

14:51.468 --> 14:54.060
and I guess I've been
in kind of an emotional tailspin.

14:54.848 --> 14:56.729
Been drinking heavier than usual?

14:57.006 --> 14:58.857
Just glass of wine with dinner.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.179
And how many dinners
have you had today?

15:04.016 --> 15:05.016
Three.

15:05.723 --> 15:06.723
So far.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.007
Okay. Go on.

15:08.592 --> 15:10.240
It's not just this breakup.

15:10.365 --> 15:13.141
For the last couple of years,
I've been trying really hard to have

15:13.266 --> 15:14.805
a meaningful relationship.

15:14.930 --> 15:17.670
As opposed to picking up some
pretty little thing for a quick bag,

15:17.795 --> 15:19.002
shag and skedaddle.

15:20.309 --> 15:22.968
"Bag, shag and skedaddle."

15:23.437 --> 15:24.737
That's charming.

15:25.441 --> 15:28.955
Anyway, no matter how hard I try
to have something more lasting,

15:29.080 --> 15:32.180
more meaningful,
the end result is always the same.

15:32.452 --> 15:36.060
I got to consider the possibility
that the problem might be me.

15:36.434 --> 15:38.234
That's not a bad instinct.

15:39.194 --> 15:41.220
If I'm doing something wrong
with these women,

15:41.345 --> 15:43.359
it'd be helpful
if I had a clue what it was.

15:43.688 --> 15:46.613
If you had to guess,
what would you say you're doing wrong?

15:47.792 --> 15:49.733
I don't know.
I love too much?

15:51.878 --> 15:52.978
Guess again.

15:54.369 --> 15:57.457
- I'm afraid of intimacy?
- Do you believe that to be true?

15:57.786 --> 15:59.699
Not really.
I just hear it all the time.

15:59.824 --> 16:02.378
Dr. Phil, movies,
TV shows, ex-girlfriends.

16:03.052 --> 16:04.304
Let me ask you something.

16:04.429 --> 16:07.175
What do you think being
truly intimate with a woman is?

16:10.620 --> 16:11.881
Not using a condom?

16:16.852 --> 16:17.852
What?

16:18.131 --> 16:20.257
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't expect that.

16:21.943 --> 16:24.763
But what I'm trying to point you
to is the kind of intimacy

16:24.888 --> 16:26.307
where you feel safe enough

16:26.432 --> 16:29.113
to be honest with a woman,
to tell her how you really feel.

16:29.648 --> 16:32.030
Come on!
Nobody cares how you really feel.

16:32.393 --> 16:33.971
What's a guy like me feel anyway?

16:34.096 --> 16:36.015
I'll tell you...
tired, hungry, horny,

16:36.140 --> 16:37.997
hungover, happy, sad and pissed off.

16:40.081 --> 16:42.867
And sad and pissed off only come
into play because I'm horny, hungry,

16:42.992 --> 16:44.420
hungover and tired.

16:45.551 --> 16:48.268
You know what? Let's table
the intimacy discussion for the moment

16:48.393 --> 16:50.475
and talk about
your other relationships.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.678
What other?

16:51.887 --> 16:54.542
If I recall, we've spoken
at great length about your feelings

16:54.667 --> 16:56.850
towards your mother,
your brother and your nephew.

16:57.236 --> 16:59.008
Pissed off, pissed off, sad.

17:00.571 --> 17:03.523
Sure. How about
non-familial relationships?

17:04.194 --> 17:06.192
Like friends?
Why don't you just say friends?

17:06.402 --> 17:08.848
I've got the diplomas, Charlie.
I like to use them.

17:10.653 --> 17:13.012
Okay, the answer
to your question is...

17:14.472 --> 17:16.035
I don't have many friends.

17:16.340 --> 17:18.037
How many friends would you say?

17:19.618 --> 17:21.790
I'm starting to feel
pissed off right now.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.667
Do you have any friends?

17:24.075 --> 17:26.128
I'm a grown man.
I have acquaintances.

17:26.297 --> 17:28.131
You spend time
with these acquaintances?

17:28.299 --> 17:30.216
For what?
To talk about my feelings?

17:32.381 --> 17:36.055
I'm not one to indulge in chitchat
unless I feel it's gonna get me laid.

17:36.385 --> 17:39.100
I'm just saying it might be nice
to have some relationships

17:39.276 --> 17:42.061
that aren't based solely on you trying
to get someone into bed.

17:44.199 --> 17:46.316
You have no idea
what I'm talking about?

17:46.628 --> 17:47.678
Not a clue.

17:48.039 --> 17:49.819
Okay, now I'm pissed off and sad.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.043
Maybe you didn't have enough dinner.

17:58.974 --> 17:59.980
Thank you.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.749
You sure you should be drinking
if you're on medication?

18:03.018 --> 18:05.452
She wouldn't give me anything.
Said I'd abuse it.

18:05.577 --> 18:06.938
Where does that come from?

18:09.749 --> 18:10.753
One more.

18:12.235 --> 18:14.654
So... did you get anything
out of the session?

18:14.940 --> 18:16.658
Not really.
She kept saying I need

18:16.783 --> 18:18.898
to develop relationships
that aren't about sex.

18:19.023 --> 18:21.271
- I can see the wisdom in that.
- Sure you can.

18:21.396 --> 18:24.262
You didn't get laid the last nine years
of a 12-year marriage.

18:24.387 --> 18:26.449
Not true.
There were birthdays.

18:27.493 --> 18:29.386
Let's pretend the shrink is right.

18:29.511 --> 18:32.274
What am I supposed to do?
Go out and make new guy friends?

18:32.399 --> 18:33.482
Who does that?

18:34.653 --> 18:35.936
Couldn't hurt to try.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.578
- Hey, there. How are you?
- Good. You?

18:41.914 --> 18:43.433
I've already lost interest.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.286
Well, I can't fault you for trying.

18:48.602 --> 18:50.787
I'm not against having
a friend in theory,

18:50.912 --> 18:54.258
but I'm a 43-year-old man
who's kind of set in his ways.

18:54.521 --> 18:56.584
Where am I supposed to go
meet this new buddy?

18:56.709 --> 18:58.887
Did you consider you could have
a woman as a friend?

18:59.012 --> 19:01.701
Alan, have you not been listening?
She said no sex.

19:02.718 --> 19:05.770
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I don't have many friends, either.

19:06.427 --> 19:09.107
- You don't have any friends.
- Yeah, neither do you.

19:09.396 --> 19:11.901
But that's my choice.
You're just a social pariah.

19:12.296 --> 19:14.821
And you're a malignancy
on the ass of mankind.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.468
You want to pick up a pizza
on the way home?

19:21.593 --> 19:23.746
- Pizza, really?
- Fine, what do you want?

19:25.128 --> 19:27.750
- I was thinking Chinese.
- We just had Chinese. How about ribs?

19:28.072 --> 19:31.004
- Great, but I'm low on cash.
- What's "low" mean?

19:31.359 --> 19:32.359
Nothing.

19:35.581 --> 19:37.760
Fine, I'll buy,
but I get to pick the movie.

19:38.242 --> 19:40.416
We don't have to watch a movie.
I TiVo'd Glee.

19:40.541 --> 19:43.001
Terrific. I'm alone and miserable,
and you want torture me

19:43.126 --> 19:44.809
with hot chicks
in cheerleading outfits.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.410
Singing hot chicks.
It's Wang Chung week.

19:49.348 --> 19:50.430
For God's sake.

19:50.555 --> 19:53.109
Why don't you put on a ass-less chaps
and get it over with?

19:53.559 --> 19:55.509
I'm not gay, I'm metrosexual.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.944
That's just a gay man
who can't get laid.

20:04.527 --> 20:07.092
<i>Everybody have fun tonight</i>

20:07.842 --> 20:10.770
Everybody Wang Chung tonight.

20:10.895 --> 20:14.352
The blonde chick in the red tracksuit
is really starting to freak me out.

20:15.768 --> 20:18.487
<i>Everybody Wang Chung tonight</i>

20:19.526 --> 20:21.401
<i>Everybody have fun</i>

20:22.762 --> 20:25.762
- <i>Deep in the world tonight...</i>
- I love Mercedes.

20:26.153 --> 20:27.303
You go, girl!
