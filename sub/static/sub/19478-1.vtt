01:25:37.715 --> 01:25:42.594
Me and my parents moved to Phoenix

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.222

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:47.349
When l was 1 6...

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:52.688
...my father was, uh, killed in a car accident
just outside of town.

01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:55.357
My mother...

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:58.861
...she'd been having these affairs
and my father knew.

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:04.908
Anyway, she felt so guilty,
she decided to become a nun.

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:12.875
So within three weeks of
my father's death...

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:15.961
...she was in a convent somewhere
in Mexico.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.797
And there l was.

01:26:23.469 --> 01:26:27.264
l had nowhere to go.
l didn't know what to do.

01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:36.106

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.320

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.489

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:03.508
...l decided to become Don Juan.

01:27:04.844 --> 01:27:07.930

01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:12.059
They wouldn't help me.
They wouldn't give me any information.

who worked there.

01:27:18.816 --> 01:27:23.403
l think she was a temp or something.

01:27:25.156 --> 01:27:28.325
But the woman took pity on me
and she gave me the girl's number.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.452

01:27:31.162 --> 01:27:34.164
l said that we were meant
to be together...

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:38.210

and then she hung up.

l just decided that my life was over
so l was gonna kill myself.

01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:50.472
Or at least l was gonna make
people believe that l would kill myself...

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.891

or something.
