WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:16.141


00:24.107 --> 00:25.734
You all right?
How are you feeling?

00:25.817 --> 00:27.694
-Good. How was it?
-It was fun.

00:27.777 --> 00:28.945
Who was there?

00:30.071 --> 00:33.992
-Everyone except Kyle and Shaina.
-Oh, really?

00:34.075 --> 00:36.745
Yeah. I mean, everyone was like,

00:36.828 --> 00:38.997
"Oh, I bet it's because
one of them is an atheist

00:39.080 --> 00:41.291
-and one of them is religious." Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.960
-We saw that coming.
-Yeah, shocker.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.213
They… There's something about
Sal and Mallory that's, like, really cute,

00:47.297 --> 00:50.967
but also, it wouldn't surprise me
if they didn't, like, last, but… It was…

00:51.051 --> 00:53.803
-I thought the same--
-So, I pressed Jarrette a little.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.307
And I was like,
"So, here's the differences.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.435
Okay, like…
What do you think about Mallory?"

01:00.518 --> 01:02.353
-Yeah.
-"Like, she's beautiful."

01:02.437 --> 01:03.646
Did Jarrette react to you?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.648
-What did he say?
-Yeah, he agreed. Totally.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.233
-Yeah.
-Kind of, like, reassured.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.818
Not convinced, but I'm a skeptic.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.739
He asked Mallory first
if she would say yes. She said no.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.699
-She cried.
-She cried?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.701
Oh, she was sobbing.
She just felt terrible.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.161
But she really likes Sal.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.913
I mean, I wish I was there. So…

01:19.996 --> 01:23.083
I wish you were there too.
I love you.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.542
But you know what?

01:25.960 --> 01:26.878
Hmm?

01:26.961 --> 01:28.630
I just wanted to get back with you.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.549
I literally was like,
"Can I leave? Can I? Can I?"

01:32.425 --> 01:34.636
Yeah. I mean,
you looked like you were having fun.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.387
Looked like?

01:36.471 --> 01:39.099
Yeah. What do you think
I was doing out there? I was bored.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.810
-You watched it?
-Yeah. Well, I watched part of it.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.229
Oh, I was talking to the girl
about capitalism. It was--

01:44.312 --> 01:47.565
-Yeah, I saw that.
-You saw that?

01:47.649 --> 01:49.025
- Yes.
-Did you hear me yelling?

01:49.109 --> 01:52.237
-What'd you think I was doing? Yes, I did.
-I waved at you. You didn't wave back.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.196
I was mad.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.864
No, not when you were walking out.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.033
I watched when
you were walking towards the beach.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.328
I didn't walk towards the beach.
That wasn't me.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.080
You were walking this way.
Yeah, you were.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.791
So, you were the only person
that was there without someone else?

02:05.291 --> 02:07.502
-Yes.
-Okay.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.047
It's not
that I don't trust you. I do.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.049
It's that I don't like some situations

02:13.133 --> 02:15.260
that are gonna make this not work.
Like today.

02:15.343 --> 02:19.514
Do you know what, though?
What didn't work today for us? You and me.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.058
-What's going on in my head.
-About us?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.811
-Everything.
-What's going on with us now?

02:24.894 --> 02:27.647
There's no penetrating us. Literally--

02:27.730 --> 02:28.731
There is.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.774
There's not.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.361
-This stuff is gonna cause big issues.
-You're gonna let it.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.989
-Yes.
-Why? Why does this cause an issue?

02:36.072 --> 02:39.868
Because I had three hours to sit here
and not do anything but be in my head.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.453
I sat in the closet. I locked the door.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.664
I shut this,
and I sat in the closet and cried.

02:44.747 --> 02:48.001
Do you think anything tonight
changed the way that I feel about you?

02:48.084 --> 02:49.043
I don't know.

02:50.336 --> 02:56.050
But if I were to leave for three hours
and you were to sit in the closet and cry,

02:56.634 --> 02:58.386
you'd probably change the way you feel.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.722
Like, if I was the one
that was going somewhere.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.350
You have to admit…
I'm not saying that to make you feel bad.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.477
I just want you to understand
where I'm coming from.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.313
I had to be here alone, by myself.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.398
-I told you I didn't have to go.
-For hours.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.358
Do you believe me? Do you trust me?

03:12.442 --> 03:16.070
I don't… I'm not kidding you,
I don't trust anything right now.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.822
-Not even me?
-Nothing.

03:17.906 --> 03:22.493
I can't believe you don't trust me at all.
My word doesn't mean anything to you.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.871
-I'm done. No, I'm done.
-Stop. Hey.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.800
-I'm not mad at you--
-But you're acting mad at me.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.762
You're being toxic and you gotta stop.
You have to start being--

03:40.845 --> 03:43.640
-I'm not mad about something.
-No. Stop.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.393
Let me finish, please.
You're not making the active effort

03:47.477 --> 03:49.896
to stop the toxicity.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.854
Ew. Ew!

04:31.938 --> 04:34.524
No. That's where I draw the line.

04:35.233 --> 04:38.278
-Starting my morning skin care routine.
-Check out my little ring.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.906
Let's go to that.
Look at that bad boy. Ooh. Sexy.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.658
I have good taste. What can I say?

04:45.785 --> 04:49.163
There's something's going on
with these healing crystals on my head.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.164


04:50.248 --> 04:53.793
Deeps gave me these.
I have to say, I'm feeling really good.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.255
-And then this one, I'm not a big--
-It's a heart crystal.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.717
I'm not a fan of this one,
because it seems very manufactured.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.352
-Did we get coffee?
-Yeah.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.148
-That was a pod promise.
-I know.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.818
I'm a woman of my word.

05:21.487 --> 05:26.409
I can sometimes be mistrusting of men,
not only because of the way that I look,

05:26.492 --> 05:29.120
but because of situations
that have happened in my past.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.331
-Thank you.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.834
Because I'm scared they're gonna be
constantly seeking out someone else.

05:34.917 --> 05:38.087
And I'm like, "They're always
gonna find someone skinnier, hotter."

05:38.171 --> 05:41.591
And I wanna make sure I'm competing
with every single person out there,

05:41.674 --> 05:45.553
and they can sense that, and I distrust
people who don't deserve that.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.555
A rose by the bed.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.681
You're welcome.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.435
-I feel like last night derailed.

05:52.518 --> 05:56.105
So, I was upset,
but when I am bubbling up like that,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.023
that's not myself.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.524
I get that.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.318
I really get that.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.905
My heart feels like I wanna forgive him
and I want him to forgive me.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.073
I want this to be over.

06:05.156 --> 06:09.660
I love, love, love that you made sure
that you ordered coffee right away,

06:09.744 --> 06:11.204
-while I was sleeping.
-Yeah. Duh.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.581
Duh, I told you I would.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.959
Typically, we're good at communicating
and letting the other person know,

06:17.043 --> 06:20.004
but it hasn't really
heightened to this level before.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.800
It's an eerie feeling.
Um, it's a new feeling and it sucks.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.181
What are we gonna do today?

06:30.264 --> 06:31.599
-You wanna go to the beach?
-Oh!

06:31.682 --> 06:33.976
Of course you spilled.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.396
-I--
-Like, "I'm gonna spill."

06:36.479 --> 06:38.272
-Then, surprise, surprise.
-Ah!

06:38.356 --> 06:41.776
-As if it couldn't get any worse in here.
-Okay, no coffee in bed for you.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.529
No!

06:45.279 --> 06:47.407
-I'll have to sit over here and drink it.
-Yeah.

06:47.490 --> 06:52.412
I can tell you 100%
if we met in real life,

06:52.495 --> 06:55.289
and we had an argument
like we did last night

06:55.373 --> 06:58.251
that early on, that wouldn't have worked.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.586
But because we have this connection

07:00.670 --> 07:03.840
and these strong communication skills
that we built in the pods,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.801
we're able to come back
from something like that.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.595
I believe our bond grows
stronger and stronger.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.515
I have something I have to tell you.
It's very important.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.684
-Yeah? Mm-hmm.
-I hope it's not a deal-breaker.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.229
-I like long walks on the beach.
-Do you?

07:18.312 --> 07:20.440
-How do you feel about them?
-I like them.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.650
-It'd be nice to walk on the beach.
-Yeah.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.360
-This here is gorgeous.
-So pretty.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.070
-It's so fucking pretty.
-Oh. This whole thing.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.824
This makes me feel like I really
should've paid attention in Spanish.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.493
-I took seven years.
-Seven? I took four.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.829
I have nothing to show for it,
except <i>"cómo está?"</i>

07:35.705 --> 07:38.332
-This beach is beautiful.
-I know. So pretty.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.169
We're at the ocean in Mexico.

07:41.752 --> 07:42.962
Engaged.

07:43.045 --> 07:43.921
Mmm.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.966
-With our whole lives ahead of us.
-I know.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.636
Can you imagine anything better?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
-No.
-Me neither.

07:52.763 --> 07:55.808
-Eek! Do you love it though?
-Yeah.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.186
-Good.
-And you. I love you.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.395
I love you too.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.231
-You wanna go in the water?
-Let's go.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.772
God, this is so pretty.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.526
-You look amazing right now.
-Aw. Thank you. So do you.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.361
Oh!

08:48.444 --> 08:51.155
Last night, when all the couples met,

08:51.239 --> 08:53.574
Mallory and Jarrette were talking
for a long time

08:53.658 --> 08:56.577
and I did think
Mallory wasn't interested in me.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.246
That's why I broke down.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.665
Then when we got back,
I just wanted to go to bed.

09:00.748 --> 09:05.044
I know that some people don't like
going to sleep angry or upset,

09:05.127 --> 09:08.631
but at that point
I was emotionally charged.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.218
I didn't want to say anything
that I would regret later.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.346
Hey, I know it's… Ugh.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.347
Huh.

09:16.430 --> 09:19.600
I don't know, Mal, I… I, um…

09:20.726 --> 09:23.354
I know it's been a lot.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.730
-Mm-hmm.
-Um…

09:26.566 --> 09:28.526
Like, this whole trip has been a lot,

09:28.609 --> 09:32.363
and, um, I know we've hit
a couple of little bumps

09:32.446 --> 09:33.906
and I just wanted to…

09:34.949 --> 09:38.786
I guess I just wanted to apologize
because I know I…

09:39.620 --> 09:40.496
I…

09:40.997 --> 09:43.374
-I just misunderstood. Um…
-Mm-hmm.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.086
-I don't feel you meant to call me out.
-We're on the same page.

09:47.169 --> 09:51.424
-I know you called me out already.
-Oh, I'll call you out.

09:53.509 --> 09:57.096
-Oh. You're lucky. I would've killed--
-I know.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.307
Most other people would've
probably killed you.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.391
I'm very lucky.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.435
Me too.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.692
I totally get it.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.154
There was a lot going on,
a lot of emotions.

10:13.237 --> 10:17.116
It was the first time
the guys were seeing all the women

10:17.199 --> 10:18.659
and we were seeing all the guys,

10:18.743 --> 10:22.663
and we're all in the same room together,
and it's just… It's a lot. Um…

10:22.747 --> 10:25.458
-Yeah. It's a little nerve-racking.
-Oh, for sure.

10:25.541 --> 10:29.086
And I think, too, like,
I don't ever want to make you feel…

10:29.920 --> 10:30.755
like…

10:31.297 --> 10:33.049
bad. I never wanna, like, hurt you.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.051
Me neither. To you, though.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.010
Yeah.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.389
Jarrette is kind of
what I've dated previously.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.850
That's where there was then
some type of connection

10:42.933 --> 10:45.144
'cause there was
some familiarity with that.

10:45.227 --> 10:49.607
But I know how much Sal cares about me
and how much I care about him.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.942
I feel like I do love Sal immensely,

10:52.026 --> 10:54.362
and I will always make sure
he knows where I stand.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.324
Those are hard conversations
and the fact that we're

10:58.407 --> 11:00.868
just up to having them together is…

11:01.369 --> 11:03.537
-Means a lot to me.
-Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.212
All of this, Mal,
is just a choice. It's a choice.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.965
I want you to be able to choose me
at the end of the day.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.425
-Mm-hmm.
-Every day.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.970
-Yeah.
-It's like… Because that's what I'm doing.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.389
I wanna choose you.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.975
I want you here 'cause you want to be.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.894
-Yeah.
-And that's why I'm here.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.396
-Same.
-Okay.

11:28.479 --> 11:33.734
Same. And trust me,
I will never be anywhere I don't wanna be.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.238
I really like that about you
and I feel like we both have

11:38.739 --> 11:41.200
very similar visions of what we want.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
Yeah. Same.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.329
So, to our engagement

11:45.413 --> 11:49.166
and whatever new challenges
we're gonna face, Mal. Like…

11:50.167 --> 11:52.002
-I'm here for it, okay?
-Same.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.713
-I know you are too.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.339
-So, cheers.
-<i>Prost!</i>

11:55.798 --> 11:59.385
-Ooh. That was such a good cheers.
-What if we broke these glasses?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.470
I wouldn't be surprised.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.141
Oh!

12:18.446 --> 12:21.157
Mm… Mm-mm-mm.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.951
-And you're a good kisser, which is nice.
-Oh my God.

12:40.551 --> 12:41.677
Yo. This is…

12:41.761 --> 12:45.389
I'm finally able to put your pod voice
to your face right now.

12:45.473 --> 12:49.894
So, today was the first day
that I realized I'm just now pairing up

12:49.977 --> 12:52.438
your pod voice and your face.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.732
Oh my God, this is so weird.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.902
Yeah, no.
I think I've got it pretty paired now.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.738
-Just happened for me right now.
-How did you even realize that?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.449
I'm sitting here listening to you talk,
and I'm just looking at you,

13:03.532 --> 13:05.075
and it's finally clicking.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.119
Can you deal with this
for the rest of your life?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.871
-Uh…
-This is a lot.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.748
-Probably not.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.334
After day one,
I was ready to run. I ain't gonna lie.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.169
But, you know…

13:15.795 --> 13:17.171
I'm just fooling.

13:17.254 --> 13:21.258
I'm gonna beat you up.
I'm gonna beat you up.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.176
I'm just playin'.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.845
Our chemistry is amazing. Um…

13:24.929 --> 13:28.307
I feel like I've been with him
for at least like five years.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.476
But seeing him talking with Mallory,

13:30.559 --> 13:33.729
I mean, I was a little worried
that maybe he'd regret his choice.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.064
You're a hater, bruh.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.775
I really do trust him. He's a grown man.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.654
What would break my heart is
if he, like, lied to me.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.114
Like, if he lied to me,
that's a deal-breaker for me.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.784
I don't like being lied to.
That's a no-go.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.162
And cheating is also a huge no-go.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.832
When I get in a new relationship,
it's almost immediately,

13:52.915 --> 13:56.794
I just like immediately
cut off certain relationships out of…

13:56.877 --> 13:59.630
For me, it's out of respect
for my new relationship.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.091
-Oh Lord.
-Are you still friends with your exes?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.594
I'm not a big fan of burning bridges,
because you never know…

14:06.178 --> 14:09.390
Why do you call it burning bridges?
I just call it boundaries.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.393
-No, I call it boundaries.
-There's boundaries within exes.

14:12.476 --> 14:15.688
But it's also like, you never know
who you're gonna need down the line.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.356
You don't need an ex.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.569
She can be somewhere in HR,
and I'm trying to get in HR

14:21.652 --> 14:23.737
and she's looking
for a position to hire and I'm like…

14:23.821 --> 14:28.617
-No. That'd be like, "No, thank you."
-You never know though.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.912
Just so accepting.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.961
I mean, I also wouldn't be communicating
with my ex every damn day.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.590
She would know that I'm married.
So, I would--

14:42.673 --> 14:45.718
-There's boundaries I wouldn't cross.
-Would she be okay with that?

14:46.218 --> 14:47.845
She has to be. The hell?

14:47.928 --> 14:52.182
It's also on me
to navigate that, you know--

14:52.266 --> 14:54.059
I'm glad you recognize that.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.770
I'd hate to have to point that out.
That's not comfortable.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.855
No, I--

14:57.938 --> 15:02.568
'Cause I'm really big on observation
and just reading body language.

15:02.651 --> 15:03.485
Mm-hmm.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.989
So, if I'm worried, then there's an issue,
but I have to see it.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.700
Would you say something in the moment?
If you were worried?

15:09.783 --> 15:13.162
No. Honestly, you probably wouldn't even
be able to tell in the moment

15:13.245 --> 15:15.372
if I'm worried or not.
It'd be after the fact, like,

15:15.456 --> 15:18.459
"Hey, babe, I don't…
That makes me uncomfortable."

15:18.542 --> 15:20.878
-I can't force you to do anything.
-Mmm.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.255
Mm-hmm.

15:23.339 --> 15:28.385
Okay. I mean, 'cause I just feel like
if you said something to me

15:28.469 --> 15:31.805
and you felt strongly about it,
then I would do the necessary things

15:31.889 --> 15:34.016
to make sure you're comfortable
within the situation.

15:34.099 --> 15:34.934
I appreciate it.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.020
I wouldn't be like,
"Well, I don't care how you feel."

15:38.103 --> 15:39.063
I wouldn't do that.

15:39.146 --> 15:43.025
I'm trusting your words,
but I also need to see it in action.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.234
Okay.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.210
-Your first cenote. Ready?
-My first cenote!

16:01.293 --> 16:03.212
-Here we are.
-I'm so excited.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.799
You know, the ancient Incans say
that each cenote…

16:06.882 --> 16:08.801
-Yeah?
-…has a spirit of its own.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.302
Ooh. I love that.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.263
This is a vibe! Do you hear the cave echo?

16:13.347 --> 16:15.975
-Oh, that's some good acoustics.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.143
-Oh, dude, this is--
-Babe, this is dope.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.938
-Holy shit.
-This is a vibe right here.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.232
Oh my God. Is it a fish?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.859
-Yep, that is a fish.
-I mean, I know it's a fish, but--

16:25.943 --> 16:28.195
I know it's your first cenote, but…
Come on.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.698
Really pumped to show Deeps this cenote.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.784
They're really, really vibey
underground caves.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.119
My first ever cenote.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.539
Her very first cenote.
It's a vibey one, honestly.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.499
-I'm liking this aesthetic.
-No one here.

16:40.582 --> 16:45.796
The last time I was at one was actually
for a music festival that Diplo was at.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.881
Definitely a different
type of cenote experience

16:47.965 --> 16:49.550
than the one we're going to today,

16:49.633 --> 16:50.801
but I'm excited.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.220
I wanna jump in so badly.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.889
I love going out and doing things.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.267
Deeps seems to be that type of person too,

16:58.350 --> 17:02.855
so just having the opportunity to go
on a mini-adventure together is awesome.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.732
This is our cenote!

17:04.815 --> 17:05.691
Yeah.

17:05.774 --> 17:10.029
This is a strong enough connection
to fight for

17:10.112 --> 17:12.614
and I need to do everything in my power

17:13.240 --> 17:17.411
to see if I can bring that missing element

17:17.494 --> 17:18.412
in our relationship.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.371
-Ready?
-Ready?

17:19.455 --> 17:20.789
One, two, three.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.215
Wow. Look at this.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.019
Smile.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.940
Amazing.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.275
How was it?

17:48.859 --> 17:49.818
It's nice!

18:01.080 --> 18:05.084
-Ooh, yeah! Nice!
-Yeah, that was a good--

18:05.167 --> 18:08.462
That was a sexy dolphin
type of thing you did. I like it.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.214
Oh boy.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.174
-That was fun, right?
-So fun.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.653
Sallory in the house!

18:32.736 --> 18:34.530
Hey!

18:35.697 --> 18:37.199
What's up, guy?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.451
-Hold on, wait, guys.
-Group hug?

18:42.371 --> 18:44.081
Y'all ready
to play some volleyball?

18:45.833 --> 18:46.667
I got Nick.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.003
-Oh! Number one draft pick! Yeah!
-Who'd you pick?

18:50.087 --> 18:53.090
-I'll take heart over height.
-You guys do your thing.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.135
-I'm just gonna watch.
-Hey. Take your shirts off.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.928
We're doing this. Yeah. Sal, come on.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.930
-Finally, she says that!

19:00.013 --> 19:02.891
-Actually, put it back on. I'm good.
-Know what?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.309
Play shirts and skins.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.686
I'm the referee.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.355
I am <i>so</i> bad at sports.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.482
The game is starting right now!

19:10.566 --> 19:13.026
I am terrified of balls coming my way.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.945
I feel…

19:37.467 --> 19:43.223
Shayne looks hot as shit.
That is not a good way to describe him.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.560
Oh, I'm going right for this one.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.353
-Oh, yeah.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.522
-Natalie, what are you doing?
-Get back here!

19:50.606 --> 19:51.899
I hate sports.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.901
-Go, sexy!
-Go, sports!

19:54.484 --> 19:58.197
I will not take an L for anything!
Let's go! Pick it up!

19:58.697 --> 19:59.907
Whoa!

20:00.866 --> 20:01.700
Nope.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.036
Our kids are in deep trouble.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.747
Oh my God.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.544
Natalie.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.088
What? I'm just taking a break.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.256
Let's go!

20:18.050 --> 20:19.092
Ah!

20:19.676 --> 20:23.096
I don't know who let me
on that volleyball court.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.062
We won!

20:34.066 --> 20:34.942
Woo!

20:35.943 --> 20:39.071
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What's gonna happen?
-Oh no!

20:39.154 --> 20:40.572
-Oh, oh, oh!
-Ah!

20:40.656 --> 20:43.575
-And there it is.
-Almost there and then he falls.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.577


20:46.078 --> 20:49.706
My water shoes failed me.
I tripped before I got to the water.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.542
I got salt water in my eyes,
so my contact was, like, burning

20:52.626 --> 20:53.752
and I couldn't see.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.463
Memorable, for sure.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
Look at this scene. Oh my God.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.682
Oh yeah.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.144
They're being such bros.
Look at them bonding.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.521
There's a solid bromance.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.566
Oh my God. They're such extroverts.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.151
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

21:18.235 --> 21:20.153
Oh shit!

21:22.948 --> 21:24.116
It's adorable.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.743
Oh, hey.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.079
-You're so extra.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.038
What I do?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.208
Everything. I don't think I realized
just how extroverted you were.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.918
You're like <i>the</i> most extroverted.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.670
-Is it a problem?
-It's not too much.

21:36.753 --> 21:40.173
I'm just worried you'll more so
be annoyed at how opposite I am.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.010
-How you just sitting down and…
-Mm-hmm. Does that bother you?

21:43.093 --> 21:46.138
No, but that's also like
I'll ask you if you want to come out.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.390
And I'll say no.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.268
-This is what I'm like when I go out.
-No, that's fine.

21:53.395 --> 21:56.023
-Wait. How's it been going, though?
-Been going really well.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.525
-Are you comfortable around him?
-Yeah. So comfortable.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.113
I think everyone looks
really good together.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.825
I was gonna say, I think
all the boys are like really good-looking.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.703
-Yeah. I think they're so cute, honestly.
-Yeah.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.998
But I think we,
as women, are out of their league

22:13.081 --> 22:14.708
-Yeah.
-But that's just me.

22:14.791 --> 22:19.463
It's so funny. It's funny to see
the dynamics of all the couples.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.382
I think just meeting Jarrette.
Jarrette was like…

22:22.466 --> 22:23.592
Kind of like, "Uh…"

22:23.675 --> 22:26.428
Like, you know…
He had definitely dated up until the end.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.138
-Come on, child.
-Get me up.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.433
Was it awkward?

22:31.516 --> 22:35.145
Yeah, it was like… it was awkward.
It was a little awkward.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.315
It was just so much all at once, you know.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.234
I'm overwhelmed.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.240
-Sorry.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.284
Oh my…

22:49.368 --> 22:54.498
-I love the wavy hair. It's so sexy.
-I know! It looks so good. I told her.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.000
That's so funny 'cause that's not
what you said last night.

22:57.084 --> 22:57.959
Just kidding.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.254
Yeah, you don't remember what you did
last night. I love that thing, though.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.048
-Do you want to be murdered?
-I…

23:16.645 --> 23:18.063
Oh. Like six.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.609
Nick and Danielle
look like opposite human beings.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.361
Yeah, but opposites attract.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.155
Do you think we're way different than…
I think we are.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.326
-We're very similar people.
-I think we have different energy levels.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.205
Yeah, but no one is on my energy level.
No one will ever be able to match that.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.749
I know,
but because I'm a little bit introverted,

23:37.833 --> 23:42.045
I think I don't get energy from people.
It's like it sucks it out of me.

23:42.129 --> 23:45.048
Yes. So, do I suck
every little bit out of you?

23:46.091 --> 23:47.259
No. Of course not.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.096
So, should I save something for later on,
so we can have some more fun

23:51.179 --> 23:54.683
in the area
that I want to have more energy in?

23:54.766 --> 23:57.436
-Oh, what? Beach volleyball?
-No, in the bedroom.

23:59.479 --> 24:00.939
I am not talking about it.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.735
-What the fuck?!

24:05.819 --> 24:06.862
Come on.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.406
I was gonna make you
put me on your shoulders.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.740
I'll do it right now.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.910
-Oh, no, nope, nope, nope.
-Ah! Got it!

24:13.994 --> 24:15.912
-Oh. There we go. Yeah?
-You've got it!

24:15.996 --> 24:16.955
Not a big deal.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.833
Yes! You can do it!

24:19.916 --> 24:22.043
-Got you!
-Let me down!

24:22.127 --> 24:23.920
-Whoa. Oh God.
-Please, gently, Shakey.

24:24.004 --> 24:27.174
-Slowly, gently. You'll never believe--
-I'm already halfway down.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.258
Okay, I got you.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.469
Let her go gently.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.304
-He did. I'm impressed.
-He did it.

24:32.387 --> 24:36.183
-I didn't think he'd be strong enough.
-Yeah, sometimes we surprise ourselves.

24:36.266 --> 24:38.101
No one thought it was possible.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.395
Yeah.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.651
I'm very curious
to see how Deeps and Shake end up.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.028
Why?

24:48.528 --> 24:52.866
Well, Shake said
that he was not at all interested

24:53.617 --> 24:55.243
in Deeps, sexually.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.205
-That's fucked up.
-That's really fucked up.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.289
What did you say?

24:59.372 --> 25:01.416
I try to stay out of that drama,
so I told him

25:01.500 --> 25:03.251
about how much great stuff we've done.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.005
-Goddamn it.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.299
Tell me about you and Danielle.
Like, you guys…

25:09.382 --> 25:11.927
I feel like you guys had
such a frigging connection

25:12.010 --> 25:15.263
and you told each other
you loved each other so quickly.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.975
-It felt like, right?
-Yeah, five days. You know, you know.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.560
That's how I feel!

25:21.561 --> 25:27.859
I will say that it's been really fun,
and we've been having a really good time.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.444
That's good.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.366
I think Mexico has helped us connect
in a lot of ways.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.535
We've built such a deep connection.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.994
Have you been physical?

25:38.078 --> 25:41.206
A little bit, but we both stopped ourself
from getting there,

25:41.289 --> 25:43.667
even though we wanted to, completely.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.961
By the way, gettin' married.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.715
-Are you physically attracted to him?
-Absolutely.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.468
He's the first brown man
I've ever kissed in my entire life.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.679
Really? What was your first kiss like?

25:56.846 --> 25:58.390
-It was great.
-I can't imagine.

25:58.473 --> 26:02.310
My gosh, the emotional connection we made
and the foundation that we built

26:02.394 --> 26:04.104
was very strong.

26:04.187 --> 26:08.483
Me and Shake can talk romantically,
and try to see if we can get there.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.986
-You know, you know, right?
-You know, you know.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.914
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

26:22.998 --> 26:23.915


26:26.459 --> 26:28.837
-Wait, this is so good.
-It is good.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.631
Best food we've eaten
in Mexico so far? Go.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.757
Tacos.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.261
-Thank you. Street tacos. Those were fire.
-Mm-hmm.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.305
But that's what I'm super excited about.

26:38.388 --> 26:41.308
In the pods,
we talked about a lot of cool things.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.977
We're like, "We're adventurous.
We can go and do things,"

26:44.060 --> 26:47.105
but actually doing it with you

26:47.188 --> 26:50.400
and just like living in the moment.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.319
Took the words out of my mouth.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.363
You're already taking
the words out of my mouth.

26:56.072 --> 26:59.075
Yeah. That's exactly
where my mind's at right now too.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.580
That does worry me, though. Honestly.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.290
-What? Hmm?
-If I'm being really honest.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.335
I think we've been
on this kind of fairy-tale vacation.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.419
Mm-hmm.

27:09.502 --> 27:14.466
But, I'm kind of approaching a point
in my life where I'm gonna have to grind.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.508
Mm-hmm.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.511
You know, I'm opening a business.
I'm opening an animal hospital.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.932
It does make me nervous
because I love to have a good time, but…

27:24.809 --> 27:26.686
I have a lot of responsibility coming up.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.356
Yeah. In the back of my mind,
I think about that all the time.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.483
It's like, when we get back to reality,

27:31.566 --> 27:33.610
when we start
to integrate our lives together,

27:33.693 --> 27:37.238
when we start living together,
how is it all gonna play out?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.032
And I'm here to support you

27:39.115 --> 27:42.369
in this career-oriented journey
that you're on.

27:42.452 --> 27:46.498
And I understand it,
because now is the time to grind.

27:46.581 --> 27:49.584
Now is the time when you're young
and you have that energy

27:49.668 --> 27:52.629
to put everything you have
into your career,

27:52.712 --> 27:55.298
so that you can enjoy your life later.

27:55.882 --> 27:58.134
I don't think
everybody fully realizes that.

27:58.218 --> 28:02.138
You really capture my thoughts
and feelings so well.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.475
I would love to be there with you
on that journey.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.979
Honestly, it means a lot to hear that.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.899
I honestly feel like you have my back

28:12.982 --> 28:15.694
more than anyone else I've ever met.

28:16.736 --> 28:20.740
I don't know that I took part
in this experiment

28:20.824 --> 28:26.287
looking for what I have right now,
which is an amazing, supportive woman

28:26.371 --> 28:27.956
who's kinda there for me.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.125
I mean, saying it back,
it sounds like…

28:30.208 --> 28:32.043
Obviously, duh,
you should be looking for that,

28:32.127 --> 28:35.046
but I don't know that those qualities
have been the hallmark

28:35.130 --> 28:36.840
of my previous relationships.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.968
It's not like this lusty,
physical relationship

28:40.051 --> 28:42.345
like I've had in the past or looked for,

28:42.429 --> 28:46.099
but I think this could be
exactly what I need.

28:46.182 --> 28:49.519
Maybe we focus less on what could go wrong

28:49.602 --> 28:53.106
and focus more on what could go right?

28:53.189 --> 28:55.567
Yeah. I like that a lot.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.610
At this point, I can't wait
to move in together.

28:57.694 --> 28:58.820
-It'll be awesome.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.656
-I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
-I'm excited for it all.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.701
-To the next chapter.
-Cheers. To the next chapter.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.257
So, am I allowed
to put you as my emergency contact now?

29:19.340 --> 29:21.885
I'm the best emergency contact,
because I answer right away.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.762


29:24.262 --> 29:28.141
-We go home tomorrow.
-I know. What am I gonna cook for you?

29:28.224 --> 29:30.477
Can't think of anything sexier
than a Salisbury steak.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.814
-I don't even know what's… Honestly--
-It's meatloaf and gravy.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.609
-Is that what Salisbury steak is?
-It's basically meatloaf.

29:37.692 --> 29:39.027
Meatloaf is not sexy.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.072
I can't wait to make your dog
like me more than he likes you.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.074
It won't take much. He's such a sellout.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.244
But I'm literally gonna train him
to like me more than you.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.371
I'm telling you,
you won't have to train him.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.998
-He'll literally go--
-I'm so excited.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.667
He will come say hi to me
and then he'll run to you.

29:54.751 --> 29:58.296
-Like, ah, I can't wait.
-And I can't wait for you to meet him.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.299
My cat, maybe not so much.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.009
Are her and Grayson gonna get along?

30:03.092 --> 30:04.010
Mm?

30:04.677 --> 30:07.305
-Yeah.
-Grayson doesn't like other dogs.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.349
I don't know
how he's gonna feel about cats.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.727
I don't think
Grayson is gonna be down for that.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.316
Um…

30:18.399 --> 30:22.403
-I'm excited to see your place though.
-Yeah, my place is pretty nice.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.533
What are you most worried about?
I do wanna know.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.286
Sometimes I don't see it coming.
It's like a freight train out of nowhere.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.956
I'm scared that you'll think
that how I've been acting

30:33.039 --> 30:36.042
is how I'm gonna act
for the rest of our lives,

30:36.125 --> 30:38.211
and it's not. It's not like that.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.505
I just had a panic attack.

30:43.675 --> 30:47.428
I'm… I'm, like,
really scared of you judging me

30:47.512 --> 30:50.348
for how I was
when I was going through that.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.893
And you… The way
that you're looking at me right now,

30:53.977 --> 30:55.854
I can tell you are judging me for it.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.523
-I'm not judging you for it.
-Yeah.

30:58.606 --> 31:03.319
I'm not judging you. I'm trying
to understand, and I'm trying to support.

31:03.903 --> 31:06.447
Yeah, no, and I believe you
when you say that. I just think--

31:06.531 --> 31:08.741
You don't give me a lot to work with.

31:10.326 --> 31:13.454
It's just like the way
that you're responding to me

31:14.330 --> 31:15.790
makes me feel worse.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.667
-A lot worse.
-I'm trying to understand.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.503
-I know.
-Like, I don't know how to handle it.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.421
Yeah.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.383
And then if I try and you get more angry,

31:26.050 --> 31:28.136
then it's like, "What do I do?"

31:28.219 --> 31:29.721
Yeah. You don't…

31:30.221 --> 31:33.600
We don't know how to navigate each other
in those situations yet.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.144
-And that's what's a huge thing.
-I'm trying.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.563
I know you are. I know you are.

31:38.646 --> 31:42.942
I genuinely do trust you, and I know
that your intentions are always good.

31:43.026 --> 31:46.946
Like, I don't ever want you to think
that I'm not thinking that.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.160
Yep.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.531
After you.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.284
This is really cute, though.

32:33.368 --> 32:35.161
This trip has been the best.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.996
Just seeing his smile,

32:37.080 --> 32:40.166
and just the way he hugs me
and the way he holds my hand.

32:40.249 --> 32:43.878
It just, like, took our relationship
to a whole new level.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.839
It's so crazy
that the wedding's three weeks away

32:46.923 --> 32:50.551
and I can't wait
to get to the married part. I'm so happy.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.722
-Cheers.
-To our first dinner date.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.600
-Oh my gosh. Yeah!
-Look at that full glass you got too.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.477
You gonna drink it all?

33:04.273 --> 33:06.693
-Oh, that's fantastic.
-What? What is it?

33:06.776 --> 33:09.696
-It's really good.
-What is it? What is it?

33:09.779 --> 33:12.407
-It's really good.
-What is it?

33:13.366 --> 33:16.536
-I can't talk with food in my mouth!
-Sorry. Okay.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.330
-I'm trying to be respectful.
-Yeah.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.835
-Are you excited to go back home?
-Mm-hmm. I'm anxious about it.

33:23.918 --> 33:24.919
I think, um…

33:26.963 --> 33:30.466
-Just having the conversations.
-With your parents and everything?

33:30.550 --> 33:33.136
-And your mom too, siblings.
-My mom will be fine with it.

33:33.219 --> 33:37.557
-I know, but it's also--
-You gonna wear that red dress for my mom?

33:41.144 --> 33:43.938
-Why would I wear that for your mom?
-Why? I mean, it's sexy.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.356
-What?
-I like it.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.943
No, I'm gonna wear a frickin' turtleneck
in the middle of the summer.

33:49.652 --> 33:53.614
I might wear an entire
just, like, zip-up onesie, honestly.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.788
Are you happy with everything
that's been going on the last couple days?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.875
Besides me, like,
ripping out your soul with all my energy?

34:03.958 --> 34:05.501
Is there anything else? Or no?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.090
That's who I am. I can't help that.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.469
When you're with your guy friends,
it's like a whole 'nother level.

34:14.552 --> 34:15.386
Yeah.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.597
I think in that way
we're different people.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.933
Don't think we have to work on it.
Just something I have to get used to.

34:21.017 --> 34:23.895
-Yeah.
-It is who you are. So, I think it's fine.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.899
-That's the person you love, right?
-Yeah.

34:28.524 --> 34:30.193
Oh!

34:30.276 --> 34:32.445
Could you give me
a little more love than that or no?

34:32.528 --> 34:34.697
I was like, "Yeah." Yeah.

34:37.950 --> 34:41.412
You… You gotta give
our relationship a little more credit.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.457
Yeah, it's not like I don't.
I'm just saying, like--

34:47.502 --> 34:50.505
You joke a lot about our relationship.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.717
How often do you say how good it is?

34:55.343 --> 34:56.761
But, like, why do I have to?

34:56.844 --> 35:00.431
Why do we need to talk
about how great it is with other people?

35:00.515 --> 35:03.184
Because we both joke around
with each other a lot, right?

35:03.267 --> 35:05.812
But, honestly,
I brag all the time about us.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.856
I know and I want to too,
but it's just not my style.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.235
-Why are you getting defensive over it?
-I'm not. No, I'm not.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.946
Sorry. It was the way
you were raising your voice at me.

35:15.029 --> 35:18.407
It was weird. Are you upset
that I don't brag about our relationship?

35:18.491 --> 35:21.077
No, I'm not upset about it. I'm just like…

35:24.038 --> 35:25.748
Why can't you brag about it?

35:25.832 --> 35:28.459
You don't brag about your purses,
your coats,

35:28.543 --> 35:32.964
you brag about how a guy treats you?
That's something you should brag about.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.632
I just show my love differently.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.968
I think you have such high expectations.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.469
Yeah, I'm not about PDA.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.305
I'm not gonna always be, like,
super affectionate with you. It's--

35:41.389 --> 35:42.682
I didn't ask that question.

35:42.765 --> 35:44.934
You're really freaking out
at me right now, I feel like.

35:45.017 --> 35:49.230
I'm not fr-- Did I raise my voice?
I'm having a conversation with you.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.567
I know. I'm just like
shutting down during it right now.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.042
I'm done.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.008
I'm the fuck out of here.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.661
Well, well, well.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.040
-Oh my God, hi!
-Hi. How are you?

36:49.665 --> 36:50.708
How are you?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.628
Been waiting a while?

36:54.420 --> 36:56.339
-This far.
-Yeah, I know.

36:56.839 --> 36:57.757
So.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.676
Where's your ring?

37:01.510 --> 37:03.137
-You're being weird.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.014
-I'm not being weird.
-You're being weird.

37:05.097 --> 37:08.351
Well, I don't know where we're standing.
I don't know where we're at.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.019
I'm just confused.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.855
I just was not comfortable
spending the night together.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.482
-Yeah.
-Sharing a bed.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.567
-It was moving too fast.
-Oh, yeah.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.944
It did freak me out.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.114
-Hi!
-Hi.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.449
-Thank you.
-Oh, it's beautiful.

37:23.532 --> 37:24.408
Looks so good.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.202
-Enjoy.
-Thank you so much.

37:26.702 --> 37:30.498
I thought about what it'd be like
to be married to you. It was…

37:30.581 --> 37:31.999
-What did you--
-I got excited.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.961
I'm not gonna let go
and give up that easy on us.

37:35.044 --> 37:40.007
You're hard to find. I've been looking
for somebody, seriously, that is like you.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.968
High-energy, fun,

37:42.051 --> 37:44.971
I don't have to act pretentious and smart.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.306
-You're yourself.
-I can be myself.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.642
-You get me the most, by far.
-I know.

37:49.725 --> 37:50.935
I'm not worried about that.

37:51.018 --> 37:54.730
I'm worried about the logistical life
that we're gonna have together.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.066
I know. At the end of the day,
it does worry me,

37:57.149 --> 37:59.193
because these things
that we're fighting about,

37:59.277 --> 38:00.444
-I'm never gonna change.
-Yeah.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.030
Your stance on those things
are never gonna change.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.450
So, are we gonna keep running into a wall,
where it's the same argument

38:06.534 --> 38:07.743
for the rest of our lives?

38:07.827 --> 38:09.745
-Get what I'm saying?
-Yeah, I understand. Yeah.

38:09.829 --> 38:13.165
I want to stay true
to my core and my beliefs.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.583
But we can work on that.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.919
I'm willing to compromise
on so much other shit

38:17.003 --> 38:20.214
that I normally wouldn't,
because there's so much I love about you.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.681
I chose Kyle. I said yes to Kyle,

38:28.764 --> 38:33.602
but I can't stop thinking about Shayne.
I can't explain it.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.772
I do have love for Shayne,
still at the end of the day.

38:36.856 --> 38:40.443
If it's true love,
time reveals all truth. We will see.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.739
Regardless of him deciding
to marry Natalie,

38:44.822 --> 38:46.324
I'm here to find my husband,

38:46.407 --> 38:49.285
not to take a back seat to Natalie
with her feelings for Shayne.

39:09.472 --> 39:13.017
Six couples fell in love
and got engaged sight unseen.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.935
Now their romantic getaway is over,

39:15.019 --> 39:18.105
and they're about to enter
the most intense phase of this experiment.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.066
I'm upset. I don't wanna leave.

39:20.149 --> 39:24.070
No! Oh my God! Go back to the real world.

39:24.153 --> 39:24.987
I know.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.824
-We're heading out. It is bittersweet.
-We're leaving Mexico.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.327
Ugh. I'm a very emotional person,
so I'm trying not to cry,

39:31.410 --> 39:33.204
but I'm also just very excited to--

39:33.287 --> 39:36.290
-Go to real life. Back home.
-Yeah, to be in Chicago with him.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.249
Eek!

39:37.333 --> 39:39.835
All good things must come to an end, huh?

39:39.919 --> 39:42.296
Well, that's kind of
a depressing way to say it.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.299
-It is. On to chapter three.
-On to the next adventure.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.717
That's what I meant to say.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.969
No more sexy beach rendezvous
and cocktails, right?

39:49.053 --> 39:51.222
-No, no, no.
-We are throwing them back into reality.

39:56.435 --> 39:59.063


40:01.399 --> 40:02.775
Hello.

40:02.858 --> 40:06.028
This is the longest I've gone
without talking to you in my entire life.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.239
-Take a look at this.
<i>-No way!</i>

40:08.322 --> 40:09.865
Yes, I am engaged.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.535
-<i> It's beautiful!</i>
-I know!

40:12.618 --> 40:13.786
<i>Put him on.</i>

40:13.869 --> 40:14.787
Oh gosh.

40:15.621 --> 40:16.455
Hi.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.915
<i>You really love her?</i>

40:18.874 --> 40:21.794
-She said, "Do you really love her?"
-I do. I really do.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.879
We're engaged!

40:23.963 --> 40:24.839
<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-I can tell.</i>

40:24.922 --> 40:26.424
<i>So excited!</i>

40:26.507 --> 40:28.884
They have their devices back
and they're headed home…

40:28.968 --> 40:32.555
-Oh my God. Got a view of the city.
-Okay.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.099
-Welcome to our home.
-My gosh.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.977
…where they're going to be living together
in a new shared apartment.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.521
I feel like this
is gonna be our real test.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.439
Yeah.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.232
Will they judge each other

40:43.315 --> 40:45.192
based upon what
they discover in the real world?

40:45.276 --> 40:49.363
Will looks, age, race, family,
even financial circumstances matter?

40:49.447 --> 40:51.699
-Hope you like it cold.

40:51.782 --> 40:54.493
They started with love,
a true emotional connection.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.037
And now, they are
just three weeks away from the altar.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.748
Will they prove that love is blind?

40:59.832 --> 41:00.749
We'll find out.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.878
-I brought goods.
-What'd you get?

41:03.961 --> 41:07.465
-A little wine for us if you want.
-Ooh.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.717
What are you up to?
Finishing up some work?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.760
We were gone for almost three weeks.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.889
So I'm trying…
Buried under a mountain of e-mails.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.932
Back to reality.

41:17.016 --> 41:17.850
I know.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.895
But I was just closing out
of everything right now.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.023
-No more work for the night, yeah?
-I know.

41:24.106 --> 41:27.109
-There's plenty of time for all that.
-Cheers.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.569
Cheers. Thank you.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.321
Yeah. Hey, I know…

41:30.404 --> 41:31.280
Mm?

41:31.363 --> 41:35.409
-Something has been on my mind.
-Do you wanna sit down and talk?

41:38.579 --> 41:39.580
I, um…

41:40.539 --> 41:41.540
Hmm?

41:48.881 --> 41:52.760
I know that there's nothing going on
with Jarrette or anything like that.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.261
But at the same time, like…

41:54.762 --> 41:58.516
I guess we never really had
an in-depth conversation about it,

41:58.599 --> 42:02.603
and I wanted to make sure
that whatever did happen that night…

42:03.103 --> 42:07.149
I mean, if there is something
that I need to be concerned about…

42:07.233 --> 42:10.819
This is something that,
like, I felt, like, happened,

42:10.903 --> 42:13.405
we talked about, and we were good.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.782
I don't understand where…

42:14.865 --> 42:19.370
I guess it worried me
that you and him were talking for so long

42:19.453 --> 42:21.747
and I just read into it.

42:21.830 --> 42:25.292
When we talked before, you were like,
"I'm not jealous." How did you feel?

42:31.715 --> 42:36.720
Honestly, Mal, I don't know
if this is me just imagining things.

42:36.804 --> 42:40.057
After you spoke to Jarrette,
I thought I heard you say

42:40.140 --> 42:43.310
that we don't necessarily
have to get married.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.523
It bothered me.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.029
-I would… Look, I just--
-Why is this happening right now?

42:54.697 --> 42:57.825
I'm feeling just a little blindsided
by all this.

42:59.743 --> 43:05.332
I said if we felt like at the end of this
that we weren't ready to get married,

43:06.041 --> 43:08.794
then it's okay if then, like, if we don't.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.588
I understand that.

43:10.671 --> 43:13.382
I just didn't understand
why that was the first thing that was said

43:13.465 --> 43:16.844
when we talked,
right after you had spoken to Jarrette.

43:20.180 --> 43:23.100
And I did think
that you weren't interested.

43:23.183 --> 43:24.101
In you?

43:25.102 --> 43:26.020
Mm-hmm.

43:30.149 --> 43:33.611
And it's not even, like,
what was necessarily said, so…

43:33.694 --> 43:35.237
What was said, then?

43:40.826 --> 43:42.953
That's what I heard, and that…

43:44.622 --> 43:46.165
That's why I freaked out.

43:46.832 --> 43:51.837
You saying we don't necessarily have
to get married at the end of all of this.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.175
I guess I didn't think that I had
something to worry about in that sense.

43:56.258 --> 44:01.722
The first thing that was said to me
after that Jarrette conversation was that.

44:03.891 --> 44:07.811
He did make a little bit of a comment
about my ring not being gold.

44:09.521 --> 44:11.857
It could've been after the comment
about the ring.

44:11.940 --> 44:15.986
And in my head, I felt like,
"Well, I don't know, we're engaged."

44:16.070 --> 44:19.615
Do you know me, then?
Like… I don't know.

44:19.698 --> 44:21.867
Like maybe I'm a little bit
in my head then too.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.913
Maybe you really don't wanna get married
to me. Maybe. Why did you propose?

44:25.996 --> 44:28.040
Do you want to get married
at the end of this?

44:28.123 --> 44:31.585
Maybe I was a little bothered
that I felt like all the women have

44:31.669 --> 44:35.297
exactly the type of ring
that they really wanted,

44:35.381 --> 44:37.299
or kind of had mentioned.

44:38.258 --> 44:39.718
I didn't know about the ring.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.970
I didn't know
it had affected you like that.

44:42.054 --> 44:44.348
I love… I love my ring.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.184
It's beautiful and I love it.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.812
I didn't make a big deal
about it because it isn't,

44:49.895 --> 44:52.731
but I think I got a little bit in my head
with that comment

44:52.815 --> 44:55.401
and feeling a little, like, slighted.

44:56.568 --> 45:00.656
Sometimes, I just can't tell, like,
how much you really care about me.

45:04.660 --> 45:08.122
You are my fiancée and I want to do that.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.334
Look, I know you love your ring,

45:12.418 --> 45:15.963
and I could've asked for more details
and that's my fault.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.090
At the end of the day, I chose this ring.

45:18.173 --> 45:20.551
-And I wanted to give it to you.
-And I love it.

45:20.634 --> 45:23.637
I don't understand why
he would make that comment to you.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.389
-Like, that's not cool.
-Mm-hmm.

45:25.472 --> 45:27.391
Even with your fiancée there,

45:27.474 --> 45:29.935
you're still saying this shit
about someone else.

45:31.019 --> 45:34.106
You already have another fiancée.
Like, why are you doing this?

45:43.198 --> 45:46.493
If we're gonna get married in two weeks,
I'm not fucking around.

45:46.577 --> 45:47.411
Okay.

45:47.494 --> 45:50.539
I had things going on yesterday,
outside of meeting your family.

45:50.622 --> 45:51.582
I can't do this.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.421
I mean, I wanna know
that you're prioritizing me.

45:57.504 --> 45:58.672
You have my heart.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.132
I wasn't the only one.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.681
You're so cute!

46:09.266 --> 46:11.769
I think we should move in together.
The next step.

46:12.811 --> 46:14.229
-I'm engaged.
-Oh my God.

46:14.313 --> 46:16.356
-I'm concerned.
-Do you wanna see the ring?

46:16.440 --> 46:18.025
No, I don't wanna see it.

46:18.525 --> 46:20.694
Don't they say
you should marry your best friend?

46:20.778 --> 46:23.572
But you should also feel
that they're more than a best friend.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.324
What the fuck are we doing?

46:27.117 --> 46:30.662
Like, I care about you.
Did you guys think you're compatible?

46:30.746 --> 46:32.206
That is comical.

46:35.167 --> 46:39.213
We have such big issues.
I think I'm at a breaking point.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.508
I never thought
that this would happen to me.

46:42.591 --> 46:46.637
This has the potential
to be one of the saddest days of my life.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.638
Holy shit.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.100
You ready for this?

46:53.811 --> 46:54.645
No.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.648
We fell in love solely based
on who we are on the inside,

46:57.731 --> 46:59.691
but I don't know that it is enough.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.195
Now is the time to decide…

47:03.278 --> 47:04.822
if love is truly blind.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.615
Do you take him to be your husband?

47:07.199 --> 47:10.369
Do you take her
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

47:11.870 --> 47:13.831
I'm falling apart.

47:14.706 --> 47:17.501
This is not how I pictured
my wedding day to be ever.

47:17.584 --> 47:19.253
-What is going on?
