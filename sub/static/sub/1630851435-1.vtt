WEBVTT

01:42.352 --> 01:43.895
What am I up to?

01:44.395 --> 01:47.774
Just having a tiff with my old man.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.428
Mr. Saman,

02:18.012 --> 02:20.682
you are the sole survivor
of this accident.

02:21.307 --> 02:26.688
Are you aware that you are now
drawing criticism from around the world?

02:28.231 --> 02:29.190
I am.

02:30.650 --> 02:34.279
You brought the army in to hunt down
a single African elephant.

02:34.362 --> 02:38.032
The whole world is shocked by this.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.744
Our duty as park rangers is to protect

02:42.370 --> 02:45.039
the plants and wildlife of the Savanna.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.458
To the point of mobilizing the army?

02:49.335 --> 02:53.214
Do you all think that was
any ordinary African elephant?

02:55.758 --> 02:58.970
We have seen
aerial photographs of the site.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.222
Are you saying
it was not an African elephant?

03:02.473 --> 03:05.268
Go to the site and verify
the size of the corpse for yourself!

03:06.519 --> 03:07.979
Its size is absurd!

03:09.022 --> 03:11.149
Like something
out of prehistoric times.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.984
It's beyond anything!

03:13.067 --> 03:15.904
Please calm yourself, Mr. Saman.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.991
The issue is the use of weapons,
no matter how over-sized--

03:20.074 --> 03:22.744
977 animals, 41 people.

03:24.621 --> 03:29.500
Those are the numbers of animals and
people that fell victim to that monster.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.170
21.2 tons.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.841
That is the average volume of food
that monster devours in one day.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.720
If left alone, in two years time,

03:40.803 --> 03:43.514
90% of the park would turn into a desert.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.393
The inevitable result
of all the herbivores dying

03:47.477 --> 03:50.188
would be the death of
the carnivores, as well.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.109
Our methods were not mistaken.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.987
If anything was mistaken...

03:59.197 --> 04:01.574
it was the number of troops we deployed,

04:02.075 --> 04:04.911
and the effectiveness
of the weapons we chose!

04:04.994 --> 04:07.914
We should have
fired missiles from the air!

04:07.997 --> 04:12.252
Are you aware that your words are
being heard by the entire world?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.254
But, we didn't.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.009
We didn't fire even a single shot.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.934
Then, how did the elephant--?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.939
A man appeared.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.568
Who's there?

04:39.654 --> 04:44.534
As that monster was leaving,
having destroyed us,

04:45.034 --> 04:48.121
a man in a black costume appeared.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.275
With no weapons, bare-knuckled,

05:18.067 --> 05:20.361
he defeated the monster.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.033
Do you expect us,

05:25.450 --> 05:28.369
no, the whole world to believe that?

05:36.210 --> 05:38.129
I've stated the facts.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.922
What more do you want of me?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.883
Wait! Mr. Saman!

05:41.966 --> 05:42.884
You're running away?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.594
Why should you believe it?

05:44.677 --> 05:47.138
I saw it with my own eyes,

05:47.764 --> 05:49.474
and even I can't believe it!

06:23.216 --> 06:24.384
Daddy.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.137
-Daddy!
-Hm?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.640
I believe you, Daddy.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.100
Oh?

06:35.269 --> 06:38.439
Even if the whole world
is caling me a liar?

06:41.776 --> 06:46.406
Sometimes, you go back
on promises with me because of work,

06:47.156 --> 06:49.158
but, that doesn't make you a liar.

06:53.329 --> 06:58.167
Daddy, was that man really so strong?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.628
Yes.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.880
Extraordinarily so.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.715
Stronger than a lion?

07:04.799 --> 07:07.427
Indeed, I think so.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.178
Stronger than a rhinoceros?

07:09.762 --> 07:10.596
Julio.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.224
My son.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.812
I will tell this only to you.

07:19.355 --> 07:23.818
This fantastic story
no sensible adult would care to hear.

07:25.069 --> 07:28.906
A fairy tale, unbelievable, but true.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.910
Who could beat him, Daddy?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.204
No one could beat him, son.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.831
Even if there was another of him?

07:37.498 --> 07:38.499
Hmm…

07:38.583 --> 07:41.127
How about his child when they grow up?

07:41.210 --> 07:42.295
Hmm…

07:51.179 --> 07:52.763
All right!

07:57.351 --> 07:59.103
Do you think he'll go in?

08:00.104 --> 08:01.063
No way.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.358
What do we do if he doesn't?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.444
Torment him until he commits suicide.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.321
But his opponent is a high schooler!

08:08.404 --> 08:10.364
Who cares? He's the one who has to do it.

08:12.783 --> 08:13.659
He went in!

08:14.702 --> 08:15.786
He really went in!

08:15.870 --> 08:16.913
What an idiot.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.372
Well, it's not our fault.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.462
He went into the building.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.380
-Yeah.
-Right.

08:26.964 --> 08:28.633
You know about this school?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.969
They say there's a monster here.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.471
A monster?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.639
A delinquent?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.641
My uncle told me,

08:36.724 --> 08:39.769
the strongest high schooler
in the world is here.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.324
Kid?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.660
You say you have something for us?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.164
You delivering something?

09:00.248 --> 09:03.167
Excuse me!

09:03.751 --> 09:04.585
Huh?

09:08.881 --> 09:09.715
Huh?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.146
This kid's making a raid!

09:24.230 --> 09:25.815
He's come to wipe us out!

09:25.898 --> 09:28.818
What, you've come to fight?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.864
S-send… out--

09:33.948 --> 09:34.824
What?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.827
Send… out…

09:37.910 --> 09:43.833
your strongest guy… Please.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.764
So, you said that and ran away?

10:00.182 --> 10:02.351
They told me to wait.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.353
For what?

10:05.229 --> 10:08.024
After school, at Tama River.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.986
Sorry, kid.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.491
None of us here is the strongest.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.370
We'll bring you the strongest in the
world, okay?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.749
But kid,

10:24.832 --> 10:28.377
the strongest in the world and Tama River…

10:29.045 --> 10:30.296
This is all for real.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.759
If you break your promise,
we're gonna have a serious problem.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.678
Okay.

10:38.971 --> 10:39.847
Huh?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.976
This just got interesting.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.153
-Take that!
-Whoa, ouch!

10:54.236 --> 10:55.363
Take that!

10:55.863 --> 10:57.490
Whoa! Yu!

10:57.573 --> 10:58.407
Huh?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.412
He came. He really came.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.416
The strongest high schooler
in the world came to fight me!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.418
He's here!

11:18.678 --> 11:19.929
I'm Baki Hanma.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.681
To be honest,

11:22.431 --> 11:24.892
for being touted as the world's best,

11:24.975 --> 11:27.436
he was smaller than I expected.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.439
I'm Rumina Ayukawa.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.945
So, you're gonna use that?

11:36.028 --> 11:36.862
Huh?

11:36.946 --> 11:39.949
Uh, well, I thought--

11:43.202 --> 11:46.205
It was the first time in my life
seeing real muscles.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.667
In that case…

11:50.376 --> 11:53.713
And then before my very eyes,

11:53.796 --> 11:55.548
so that even I could tell,

11:56.757 --> 11:58.843
Baki morphed into the world's best.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.220
I won't hold back.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.725
Against an elementary schooler like me?

12:06.934 --> 12:08.060
Are you kidding me?

12:09.353 --> 12:11.480
He's serious!

12:12.648 --> 12:14.108
H-he's taken a stance!

12:15.151 --> 12:16.819
He's not serious.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.533
I was bullied into this,

12:23.284 --> 12:24.827
but I was hoping

12:26.495 --> 12:30.624
there was no way a high schooler would
take an elementary schooler seriously.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.003
And he's the world's best!

12:34.628 --> 12:36.589
I'm just pretending to be tough.

12:37.548 --> 12:41.469
I thought he'd smile brightly,
and take it easy on me.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.637
I was so wrong!

12:46.182 --> 12:47.057
Can you swim?

12:47.141 --> 12:47.975
Huh?

12:48.058 --> 12:49.185
What?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.186
A little.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.979
What? What in the world?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.981
Why are you ask--

12:55.065 --> 12:57.526
The world's best
disappeared before my eyes.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.986
My ass!

13:07.077 --> 13:09.121
Even if I live to be 80 years old,

13:09.747 --> 13:11.332
this will undoubtedly be…

13:13.209 --> 13:14.251
the greatest…

13:15.419 --> 13:16.253
Whoa!

13:17.087 --> 13:18.255
…shock.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.258
I guess he was serious.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.266
-Oh, what the hell?
-Huh?

13:29.934 --> 13:30.768
It's shallow!

13:44.824 --> 13:48.911
For the first time in twelve years…

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
for the first time in my life…

13:52.706 --> 13:54.124
From now on,

13:55.084 --> 13:55.960
we're buddies.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.129
I became aware that I was a man.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.637
I hit you as hard as I could.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.555
Huh?

14:08.055 --> 14:10.975
I hit you, Rumina Ayukawa,
an elementary schooler,

14:11.058 --> 14:12.893
with all my strength.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.398
All my strength, Rumina,

14:18.107 --> 14:19.900
is over a hundred times theirs.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.783
They look so small.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.370
They do, don't they!

14:35.249 --> 14:37.751
Hey, Captain Strydum!

14:44.550 --> 14:45.926
It was like a fairy tale.

14:46.802 --> 14:50.139
Baki's father, the strongest in the world,

14:50.222 --> 14:54.184
had killed a dinosaur-like elephant.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.105
A dinosaur-sized African elephant?

14:58.689 --> 15:02.443
Baki, do you know what that means?

15:07.781 --> 15:09.533
-Oh!
-Whoa!

15:10.618 --> 15:11.452
He accepted?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.078
Yes.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.541
The Ogre has recognized you
as the challenger.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.586
How will you respond?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.092
Huh?

15:27.176 --> 15:31.430
Captain, this is just
a silly quarrel between father and son.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.600
A common occurrence in any family.

15:35.184 --> 15:39.104
It's not anything an American like you
should be poking your nose into.

15:45.903 --> 15:49.114
I will be poking my nose into it, Baki.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.951
Just a quarrel between father and son?

15:52.034 --> 15:54.119
You don't understand a damn thing.

15:55.537 --> 15:59.375
This problem is equivalent
to two countries fighting!

16:06.465 --> 16:07.633
Aw, he's upset.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.885
Hey, Captain!

16:10.469 --> 16:14.890
In the meantime,
I'll find some random to spar with.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.315
Ha, he's bent out of shape.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.994
Baki, can I ask you a question?

16:36.245 --> 16:41.000
Um, your father's stronger
than an African elephant,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.626
but you're sparring a "random"?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.253
Rumina.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.171
"Random" doesn't mean "half-assed."

16:46.255 --> 16:49.425
A "random" opponent,
as strong as a dinosaur.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.759
Wanna see?

16:50.843 --> 16:51.677
What?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.221
I'm going to spar with him now.

16:55.931 --> 16:59.685
Baki's movements-- this is shadow boxing.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.688
I'm actually well-versed in boxing.

17:03.772 --> 17:07.317
Shadow boxing is a kind of basic training.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.280
Everyone does it,
from top class boxers, to beginners.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.325
You imagine your opponent before you.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.911
Slipping imagined punches…

17:19.079 --> 17:21.081
and striking at imagined openings.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.834
He's getting faster.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.836
He's getting more focused.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.589
There's nothing half-assed about it.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.801
This was no longer
the kind of shadow-boxing I knew.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.764
Rather than imagining an opponent…

17:37.848 --> 17:41.435
it's like there's a real one
right in front of him.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.104
Huh?

17:44.188 --> 17:45.606
What?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.358
I saw it! Or rather, I see it!

17:49.318 --> 17:50.944
I couldn't believe my eyes.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.114
It's not clear,

17:54.948 --> 17:57.242
but there's definitely something there.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.620
It's undoubtedly facing off with Baki.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.121
It punched?

18:01.872 --> 18:02.790
He slipped it!

18:05.417 --> 18:09.379
I could no longer deny what was happening.

18:09.463 --> 18:13.300
The opponent
Baki was imagining was a boxer.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.595
To be clear, I'm well-versed in boxing.

18:16.678 --> 18:21.308
Baki's focus and the fact
he was struggling, all made sense.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.310
I could see it.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.314
The movement of Baki's feet,
of his hands.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
The movement of his body.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.821
It's blatantly clear from all of his
movements.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.573
The guy Baki is fighting,

18:37.282 --> 18:39.535
is the former heavy-weight world champion

18:41.870 --> 18:43.705
Iron Michael himself!

18:45.040 --> 18:46.333
Iron Michael.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.671
I don't know everything
about the history of boxing.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.798
But, at one point in time,

18:52.881 --> 18:56.093
this Michael guy was considered
the strongest on Earth.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.930
And now I'm seeing Iron Michael
right before my very eyes.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.057
He's so fast, just like in his prime!

19:02.141 --> 19:06.395
The Michael I've only ever seen in videos,
in his prime and at his best,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.480
is fighting right in front of me!

19:10.065 --> 19:11.066
Oh no!

19:11.150 --> 19:13.735
A left to the body to draw
the opponent's guard, then an upper cut!

19:13.819 --> 19:15.237
Michael's KO combo!

19:15.320 --> 19:16.238
Baki, the upper cut!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.115
It connected!

19:23.203 --> 19:27.291
W-What are the two of them doing?

19:27.374 --> 19:28.625
A pantomime?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.630
Baki, your nose is bleeding.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.091
It's fine.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.635
Bruises on his body?

19:43.807 --> 19:44.892
Now I'm warmed up.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.145
Let's…

19:51.231 --> 19:52.524
finish this.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.278
Oh!

20:05.954 --> 20:07.039
That's illegal.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.790
That's right, it is illegal.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.084
In boxing.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.047
Um…

20:15.631 --> 20:16.506
Yeah?

20:16.590 --> 20:19.301
Um, what were you doing?

20:20.177 --> 20:21.220
Shadow boxing.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.972
By yourself?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.641
Well, it's shadow boxing.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.060
But you have a nose bleed, and bruises…

20:28.644 --> 20:31.313
There can be damage,
if it's done properly.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.066
No way.

20:35.943 --> 20:41.949
Right now, I have five pickled plums
and a slice of lemon in my hands.

20:44.159 --> 20:49.081
Sour pickled plums, and a sour lemon.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.335
I'm going to shove all of them
into your mouths.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.336
What?

20:54.419 --> 20:58.340
I'll be covering your mouths,
so there's nothing you can do…

20:59.007 --> 21:01.093
but chew.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.721
Your mouths are stuffed with pickled
plums and lemon.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.476
So sour!

21:14.773 --> 21:16.483
A mystery of the human body.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.486
There are no pickled plums
or lemons in your mouths.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.572
And yet they are full of saliva.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.496
I'm surprised you saw.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.914
Huh?

21:30.998 --> 21:32.165
The shadow boxing.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.252
Well, I'm a boxing fan.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.005
And the opponent I was fighting?

21:39.756 --> 21:40.799
Iron Michael.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.011
The former undisputed
world heavyweight champion.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.595
Huh.

21:45.679 --> 21:50.142
That's what you meant by "random"
but not "half-assed."

21:50.851 --> 21:53.020
Iron Michael is the perfect fit.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.316
A "random opponent."

21:57.816 --> 22:00.610
It'd be a breeze, if I was going
against someone like Michael.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.528
Huh?

22:01.611 --> 22:03.238
That was a warm-up.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.115
Just to get loose.

22:05.615 --> 22:09.244
Iron Michael was a warm-up?

23:47.426 --> 23:52.139
