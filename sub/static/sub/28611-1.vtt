00:20.237 --> 00:22.109
...in Batavia City tonight,

00:22.152 --> 00:24.937
as yet another coordinated
series of armed robberies

00:24.981 --> 00:26.785
have left four dead

00:26.809 --> 00:29.290
and 35 injured at
six different crime scenes...

00:29.333 --> 00:31.640
...left to wonder who could

00:31.683 --> 00:33.163
possibly save our city now.

03:21.549 --> 03:22.724
Hello?

03:47.357 --> 03:49.011
Edi?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.580
Dad, help me!

03:58.281 --> 04:01.458
I've brought
your beloved son home.

04:01.502 --> 04:04.374
What has he done?

04:04.418 --> 04:07.290
You should ask
what youhave done.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.033
He has nothing to do with this.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.382
Let him go!

05:34.029 --> 05:36.205
Hey, sorry I'm late,
I was at the cafe...

05:36.248 --> 05:38.642
How long are you
going to wait tables, Sri?

05:38.686 --> 05:41.993
Come on, Mom.
At least let her eat first.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.692
Here.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.217
- More?
- That's plenty.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.352
You know, you'd be better off
working with Umbra.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.832
You could make good money.
Spend time with your brother.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.921
You don't have a future
at that cafe.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.142
I don't want to
get stuck behind a desk...

06:00.185 --> 06:01.424
Oh, so you'd rather
be a waitress for

06:01.448 --> 06:02.536
the rest of your life.

06:02.579 --> 06:05.408
Mom, she'll find
her own way eventually.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.454
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

06:07.497 --> 06:10.195
She doesn't listen
to a single word I say.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.762
She dropped out of college,

06:11.806 --> 06:14.243
and now, she has no concept
of responsibility.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.960
What future is there
for someone like that?

06:15.984 --> 06:17.681
It's none of
your business, mom.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.726
Sri.

06:25.254 --> 06:28.257
Try not to worry too much
about what mom said, OK?

06:31.521 --> 06:33.218
It's harder without dad.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.657
He would've known
just what to say.

06:38.006 --> 06:41.488
Hey, how's the acting going?
You get big yet?

06:41.531 --> 06:44.752
I'm still
waiting to get discovered.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.282
Hey.

06:54.631 --> 06:58.243
I know Mom's hard
on you sometimes.

06:58.287 --> 07:01.203
But she's the only
family we have left.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.379
She wants you to be happy.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.514
But losing dad, it really
hasn't been easy on her.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.385
I won't ask you to understand.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.083
But please try to be more
patient with Mom, OK?

07:13.781 --> 07:15.347
See you later.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.175
Don't let her worry too much.

07:59.870 --> 08:02.786
Wi, Wi, camera stand by.

08:05.397 --> 08:07.312
Ready.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.010
- Ready?
- OK.

08:11.142 --> 08:14.494
A robbery occurred tonight
at the Ponsa Gallery...

08:23.590 --> 08:25.635
A plague has infected our city.

08:27.202 --> 08:28.812
These criminals...

08:30.335 --> 08:32.554
are organizing
more and more every day.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.775
They've begun to from
a syndicate.

08:34.818 --> 08:37.212
And we can't keep up.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.214
The more that they unite,

08:39.256 --> 08:41.520
the harder they are to stop.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.455
We've got to
get this under control.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.030
Good evening,

09:13.074 --> 09:15.337
people of Batavia City.

09:15.380 --> 09:20.255
Has your sleep been
troubled lately? Perhaps...

09:20.298 --> 09:23.345
Mr. Syamsul! Keep it rolling.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.740
Mr. Syamsul!

09:26.783 --> 09:28.176
Ma'am. Ma'am!

09:28.219 --> 09:29.899
Please, just give me
one minute with him.

09:33.398 --> 09:36.010
Or perhaps...

09:36.053 --> 09:40.057
"Will my children make
it home from school?"

09:42.625 --> 09:45.585
My men and I have darkened
your city with fear.

09:49.327 --> 09:53.941
But through this fear, we have
given you the gift of order.

09:55.856 --> 10:00.512
Anyone who stands against us
will die in agony.

10:01.557 --> 10:04.299
Anyone, including the police!

10:06.693 --> 10:09.609
You will know the depth
of my generosity.

10:10.784 --> 10:14.918
But only if you
do not fight back.

10:14.962 --> 10:21.098
As long as you obey us,
you will all know peace.

10:21.142 --> 10:25.407
I, The Shadow,
will protect you.

10:27.235 --> 10:32.327
But for now, you have
a decision to make.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.677
I bid you good evening.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.594
Enjoy this beautiful night.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.773
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

10:46.471 --> 10:49.126
80% of television news coverage

10:49.170 --> 10:51.520
is about crime and violence.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.478
Children learning
from a young age

10:53.522 --> 10:56.481
that life's about surviving,
not thriving.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.440
Gangsters are role models,

10:58.483 --> 11:01.399
the drug dealers
are career advisers.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.227
What I'm trying to say...

11:03.271 --> 11:07.101
is we need a role model
for the kids.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.624
Someone who's inspirational,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
who gives power back
to the people.

11:10.278 --> 11:14.325
Valentine is a superhero,
in the movie.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.025
Look, Bono,

11:19.374 --> 11:22.377
my job is to make money,

11:23.291 --> 11:25.249
not to inspire people.

11:27.295 --> 11:30.124
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your time.

11:34.737 --> 11:39.176
OK, girls, girls, girls,
five more minutes to runway, OK?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.527
- Mr. Wawan.
- Yes?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.704
There's a guy here for you.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.751
Oh, my God. Bono?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.365
What? Superhero?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.106
Come on.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.195
Look, I'm trying to make
a movie. I need your help.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.849
And just keep it down.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.938
I'm looking for
a beautiful girl, young,

12:01.982 --> 12:03.853
good at martial arts.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.029
OK. She's 23,

12:06.073 --> 12:08.205
flawless skin, legs for days.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.600
Look at her. Oh, my God.
Gorgeous, right?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.558
See? And this one...

12:13.602 --> 12:15.256
Oh, my God.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.128
Oh, my God, I love her.
Don't you love her? Look at her.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.696
She just woke up like this.
Oh, my God...

12:20.740 --> 12:23.612
Good, so, who knows
which kind of martial arts?

12:25.396 --> 12:26.789
None of them.

12:30.924 --> 12:35.537
Muai Thai champion, body that
won't quit, but she ugly.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.540
This one's Wushu.
Her hands are like,

12:38.583 --> 12:40.020
but she ugly.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.805
Ooh! You want karate?

12:44.067 --> 12:45.765
Well, she's short andshe ugly.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.333
This is really
all you've got, Wan?

12:51.074 --> 12:52.423
I gotta pee.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.258
Here you go.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.349
What are you doing?
Please stop that!

13:08.222 --> 13:09.832
Don't be like that.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.486
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

13:11.529 --> 13:13.270
Let me go!

13:13.314 --> 13:14.663
Let me go!

13:16.404 --> 13:18.145
Let me go!

13:18.188 --> 13:20.060
- What... Let me go!
- Sir, please...

13:53.223 --> 13:54.790
What did I miss?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.748
I think we just found her.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.665
So, what's this movie about?

14:00.709 --> 14:03.799
Before we get to that,
let me be real with you.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.757
Every producer...

14:05.801 --> 14:07.542
said no to this movie,

14:07.585 --> 14:09.805
which means we have
to take action

14:09.849 --> 14:12.373
and prove all
the producers wrong.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.940
But it's not just for them.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.116
You're gonna be
a role model for the kids.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.945
We're gonna inspire
the people of Batavia City,

14:18.988 --> 14:20.381
the people of this country.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.906
and, hey,
maybe the whole world.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.604
Uh, what are we
talking about here?

14:26.648 --> 14:30.086
We're talking about
making a movie, Val.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.568
- Why you call me Val?
- Because you are Valentine.

14:33.611 --> 14:34.874
What's Valentine?

14:36.397 --> 14:38.007
What's this guy's deal?

14:38.051 --> 14:40.575
It's a superhero movie.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.970
Finally! There!
My first question answered.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.841
OK, now that we're all
in the same page,

14:45.885 --> 14:46.973
any other questions?

14:48.975 --> 14:50.933
C... Can I get a drink?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.979
Oh, yeah, I'll get it.

14:53.022 --> 14:56.156
OK, so we start tomorrow.
We'll go out and fight crime.

14:56.199 --> 14:58.332
Get it on camera,
release the teasers on YouTube,

14:58.375 --> 15:01.465
so that everyone knows
that this hero exists.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.859
Wait, I've got to fight
for real?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.514
- Yes, for real.
- What? For real?

15:06.557 --> 15:08.864
Don't worry, we'll take
precaution for your safety,

15:08.908 --> 15:13.173
but, uh, seeing your skill sets,
I think you can handle it.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.783
Do I get any days off?

15:14.826 --> 15:17.177
Honey, you're fine.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.658
But will I get paid?

15:20.702 --> 15:24.010
- I'm getting paid here, right?
- Yes, of course.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.837
What? She is?

15:28.144 --> 15:29.363
Uh...

15:31.147 --> 15:32.888
So, what do I wear?

15:42.680 --> 15:45.118
OK, so the design
could use some work.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.096
♪ There's this girl Valentine,
she be hella fast ♪

15:47.120 --> 15:49.209

16:08.750 --> 16:10.012

16:17.411 --> 16:19.848
Hurry up! Give us the money!

16:19.891 --> 16:21.545
Come on! Where's the rest of it?

16:21.589 --> 16:22.329
This all there is,

16:22.372 --> 16:23.199
look for yourself!

16:23.243 --> 16:25.201
Hand it all over!

16:25.245 --> 16:27.987
- Open it! Just take it all!
- Wan? What the hell?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.554
- Please, no!
- Fight 'em!

16:30.598 --> 16:33.079
Whatever, I just want food!

16:33.993 --> 16:36.256
Eat that! Get 'em!

16:40.695 --> 16:41.870
Hey!

17:15.077 --> 17:17.775
Hello, police? Police?

17:36.098 --> 17:39.667
Uh, buddy? Buddy?

17:41.756 --> 17:44.889
You should call the police, OK?
Thanks.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.067
Wan! Let's go!

17:49.851 --> 17:52.071
Hello... Hello, police?

17:58.294 --> 17:59.817
How was it? What happened?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.300
Yeah!

18:04.344 --> 18:05.649
We did it, we did it!

18:05.693 --> 18:07.042
We did it!

18:07.086 --> 18:08.696
Amazing!

18:08.739 --> 18:09.871
Yes.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.093
Wooh!

18:15.964 --> 18:18.967
- Holy shit, Wan.
- Well, it's not my fault.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.925
Obviously I wasn't
born for this.

18:20.969 --> 18:23.450
I'm no cameraman,
I'm a stylist, remember?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.670
Nor are you a good stylist.

18:26.714 --> 18:30.239
That cape is useless,
it almost choked me to death.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.849
You cannot blame all this on me.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.333
Why didn't you tell
me you were gonna

18:33.373 --> 18:35.157
punch here and there
that fast?

18:35.201 --> 18:37.135
Everything on fast forward,
my hands couldn't keep up.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.943
You know, you were like,
everywhere.

18:38.987 --> 18:43.731
Or maybe it's because your mask
keeps sliding off my face.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.516
And I'm bruised up, because
nothing's protecting my arms,

18:46.560 --> 18:48.083
my knees.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.824
Two robbers were apprehended

18:49.867 --> 18:52.218
by a woman in a mask.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.264
Sir, can you tell me about
what happened here last night?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.309
Yes, ma'am.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.614
I was opening the register...

18:57.658 --> 19:00.487
OK, so you're
getting need kneepads,

19:00.530 --> 19:02.489
shin guards, wrist guards,

19:02.532 --> 19:04.752
you need protection.

19:04.795 --> 19:05.816
Did she say anything,

19:05.840 --> 19:06.754
or leave a message for you?

19:06.797 --> 19:08.799
No cape.

19:08.843 --> 19:09.931
She told me to call

19:09.974 --> 19:11.062
the police, then she left.

19:11.106 --> 19:14.805
We need to trade
the rope for handcuffs.

19:14.849 --> 19:17.591
I'll fix the mess.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.507
...woman behind the mask.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.204
You need to grow some balls.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.429
I like your choice of color.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.782
And the hair,
it looks very nice.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.828
Thank you.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.181
We need to figure out a way

19:42.224 --> 19:44.544
- to take these guys down faster.
- These guys down faster.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.786
Eyewitness reports
from around Batavia City

22:32.829 --> 22:34.265
confirm that a masked woman

22:34.309 --> 22:36.311
has been stopping robberies
all over town.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.227
The suspects have been
apprehended by the police.

22:52.022 --> 22:54.285
Sir, what is your opinion
about Valentine?

22:54.329 --> 22:57.376
- I don't have time to comment.
- I just have one question.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.508
Will the police be
cooperating with Valentine

22:59.552 --> 23:02.032
to reduce crime rates
in Batavia City?

23:02.076 --> 23:04.034
The Batavia City
Police Department

23:04.078 --> 23:07.951
does not condone the activities
of any civilian vigilantes.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.997
- That's all I have to say.
- But, sir,

23:10.040 --> 23:11.651
with so many criminals
on the streets,

23:11.694 --> 23:13.522
couldn't the police use
someone like Valentine

23:13.566 --> 23:15.437
to help keep
the city safe at night?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.918
Sir! Please, sir,
just give us one quote!

23:21.487 --> 23:23.489
So, how long have
you been studying silat?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.928
Since I can remember.

23:27.971 --> 23:30.409
My father taught me
and my brother everything.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.672
Why silat?

23:37.154 --> 23:40.593
For my family,
silat is the way of life.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.769
Your father must be
very proud of who you've become

23:42.812 --> 23:44.292
because of silat.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.469
- He's dead.
- Oh.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.907
I'm... I'm sorry.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.910
I didn't realize
I miss those moments,

23:53.954 --> 23:56.783
until they suddenly
became memories, so...

23:58.524 --> 24:02.528
And you?
Why a superhero movie?

24:09.448 --> 24:12.929
Because I believe that
the smallest action...

24:12.973 --> 24:15.541
can have a big effect
in someone else's life.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.239
And your family?

24:18.282 --> 24:19.893
Guys, something's happening!

24:21.329 --> 24:23.157
Let's go, we got to go,
we got to go!

24:50.576 --> 24:51.664
Let's go!

24:58.148 --> 25:00.629
- Go after her!
- The door won't open!

25:00.673 --> 25:01.848
Give me that!

25:15.862 --> 25:17.341
Damn.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.525
Hey, we got company.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.408
Perfect timing.
Gonna catch these hands.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.015
The two suspects were brought

33:37.058 --> 33:39.060
to the precinct
for interrogation.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.473
where they were charged with robbery and aggravated assault.

33:41.497 --> 33:44.152
By all accounts, this means
that the masked woman

33:44.196 --> 33:46.502
known as Valentine
is back in action.

33:46.546 --> 33:48.548
According to witnesses,

33:48.591 --> 33:51.290
Valentine was sighted chasing
the criminals in this area.

34:02.649 --> 34:04.477
You're really planning
to sell our house?

34:08.568 --> 34:11.527
Where have you been?
Is the cafe open all night now?

34:11.571 --> 34:14.356
Easy, Mom.
Let me talk to her.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.626
Sri.

34:35.768 --> 34:37.813
You understand...

34:37.858 --> 34:39.599
there are a lot of bad memories

34:39.641 --> 34:41.556
in this house for all of us,
right?

34:43.516 --> 34:45.648
Dad died here.

34:45.692 --> 34:48.650
I still have
nightmares about it.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.478
Every night.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.272
Listen.

35:02.665 --> 35:05.886
Maybe by selling this house,

35:05.929 --> 35:08.280
we'll all get a chance
to start over.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.939
If we really sell this house,

35:15.983 --> 35:18.246
We won't just lose
the bad memories.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.900
We'll lose all of them!

35:40.616 --> 35:43.315
The true identity of
the masked female vigilante

35:43.358 --> 35:45.665
known as Valentine,
who has been single-handedly

35:45.708 --> 35:48.885
apprehending bands of notorious criminals all over Batavia City

35:48.929 --> 35:52.367
remains a mystery even to the Batavia City Police Department.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.458
I think we did it.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.523
We have convinced them enough
to believe in Valentine.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.680
Right.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.509
So when are we
gonna start the shoot?

36:06.120 --> 36:09.036
- It's only a matter of time.
- Yeah.

36:09.906 --> 36:12.518
Speaking of which, um...

36:12.561 --> 36:14.955
- Uh, give me a second.
- All right.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.304
Just wait.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.482
Here we go.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.355
I got you...

36:24.486 --> 36:26.706
- some new gadgets.
- Yay!

36:28.751 --> 36:30.188
Now, thanks to technology,

36:30.231 --> 36:32.364
you just stick it to your face
like this.

36:32.407 --> 36:35.932
I'm telling you, girl, these
gadgets will change your life.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.805
These aren't gadgets.
They're tools.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.241
Are you on your period?

36:42.287 --> 36:43.853
I thought it was
time to celebrate

36:43.897 --> 36:46.116
because of how far you've come.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.249
I just want to start
to shoot already.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.511
We can celebrate then.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.777
I think... I think
I'm gonna go rest.

36:54.821 --> 36:55.821
OK.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.353
Look at that boy.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.703
Did you see that?
You hurt his feelings.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.663
I'm tired of waiting.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.273
And you think I'm not?

37:12.317 --> 37:14.188
But waiting's our only option.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.669
You just have to be patient
for a little bit longer.

37:16.712 --> 37:19.038
Once you're a big movie star,
you can complain all you want,

37:19.062 --> 37:21.978
but Bono has done nothing
but try to help you.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.197
That poor man.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.710
Many look down on Valentine's

38:41.754 --> 38:43.886
vigilante methods of
crime-fighting.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.801
But her action have
succeeded in reducing

38:45.845 --> 38:47.934
public fears surrounding
the infamous crime lord

38:47.977 --> 38:49.544
Shadow and his subordinates.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.416
Still, even to this day,

38:51.459 --> 38:53.853
police and civilians alike
are left to wonder,

38:53.896 --> 38:58.031
who is this masked
young heroine?

38:58.074 --> 38:59.380
Ever since Valentine first

38:59.424 --> 39:01.208
started her one-woman
war on crime,

39:01.251 --> 39:03.471
civilians all over town have
reported feeling safer

39:03.515 --> 39:05.343
in Batavia City.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.562
Can you tell me how
you feel about Valentine?

39:07.606 --> 39:08.563
Well, the police certainly

39:08.607 --> 39:09.956
aren't going to protect us.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.784
So, it's nice to know
someone will.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.786
What about you, sir?

39:13.829 --> 39:14.850
I like how she doesn't

39:14.874 --> 39:15.875
play by the rules.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.355
She does what the cops can't.

39:17.398 --> 39:20.358
Well, there you have it, folks.
Back to studio.

40:07.187 --> 40:10.669
- Who is she?
- Her name is Valentine.

40:18.546 --> 40:20.069
That's cute.

41:00.675 --> 41:01.850
Yes, sir.

41:32.968 --> 41:35.405
Move back! Get back!

41:39.148 --> 41:41.368
What's the situation inside?

41:41.411 --> 41:43.413
He refuses to talk to anyone,

41:43.457 --> 41:44.458
sir. Except Lukman.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.721
- Officer Lukman?
- Yes.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.245
- Sir.
- Sir.

41:49.289 --> 41:50.508
I'm Lukman.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.901
Have they been briefed
about this already?

41:52.945 --> 41:55.034
All right, let's get started.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.514
I'll make the call.

41:59.995 --> 42:01.649
Hostages confirmed.

42:06.436 --> 42:09.831
- Hello?
- Officer Lukman.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.181
From this point forward,

42:12.225 --> 42:14.880
I wish to speak with you,
and you alone.

42:15.794 --> 42:17.926
Why is that?

42:17.970 --> 42:20.886
Wouldn't you rather hear
about the hostages?

42:20.929 --> 42:24.454
OK. Let them go first,
then we'll talk.

42:24.498 --> 42:27.545
Your confidence is inspiring,
officer.

42:27.588 --> 42:30.460
Unfortunately, you're not
the one in control.

42:30.504 --> 42:33.376
These people's lives
are at stake.

42:33.420 --> 42:35.857
If you want them
returned safely,

42:35.901 --> 42:38.425
then you will meet my demands.

42:42.124 --> 42:43.517
And what is it you want?

42:45.954 --> 42:47.521
First,

42:47.565 --> 42:50.611
I want Selly, the reporter
from Channel 11,

42:50.655 --> 42:53.440
to be here in exactly
five minutes.

42:53.483 --> 42:55.616
OK, what else?

42:55.660 --> 43:00.316
You must disband the entire
Batavia Police Force.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.758
You have ten minutes to comply.

43:19.292 --> 43:22.077
- Ma'am, are you Selly?
- That's me.

43:56.721 --> 44:00.594
Now, let's see if
your precious police

44:00.638 --> 44:03.292
will be able to save you.

44:17.742 --> 44:20.396
Welcome, Miss Selly.

44:21.615 --> 44:25.314
Would you kindly
cover this melodrama?

44:25.358 --> 44:29.014
I want everyone
in this fine city to know

44:29.057 --> 44:32.017
what happens inside
of this bank today.

44:32.060 --> 44:33.409
But what is your reason

44:33.453 --> 44:35.673
for doing all of this
in the first place?

44:37.065 --> 44:39.111
This way, please.

45:09.794 --> 45:12.318
Currently, there are
three hostages here

45:12.361 --> 45:15.408
that have bombs wired
around their bodies.

45:15.451 --> 45:18.716
Their fate rests upon
the outcome of negotiations

45:18.759 --> 45:20.543
between Shadow and the police.

45:20.587 --> 45:23.546
This is Selly from
Channel 11 reporting live.

45:23.590 --> 45:25.766
Sorry, sir, but it's time.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.507
We're moving in.

45:27.550 --> 45:29.857
You can't do that. It'll ruin
the negotiation process.

45:29.901 --> 45:31.990
There's no negotiation!

45:32.033 --> 45:35.776
The police of Batavia City
do not submit to madmen.

45:36.908 --> 45:39.475
- Hendro!
- Sir, yes, sir!

45:40.346 --> 45:43.479
Selly, leave.

46:09.157 --> 46:11.116
Shadow, help me understand.

46:11.159 --> 46:13.181
Why exactly do we have to
dissolve the police force?

46:13.205 --> 46:18.079
Because they are worthless,
empty-headed dogs.

46:29.656 --> 46:31.571
OK, then, free the hostages.

46:31.614 --> 46:33.399
You know they're
innocent in this.

46:33.442 --> 46:35.575
They have nothing to do
with the police of Batavia.

46:35.618 --> 46:37.316
So be it.

46:40.885 --> 46:42.364
Hands up!

46:59.729 --> 47:00.818
On your knees.

47:33.938 --> 47:36.114
Holy molly.

47:37.506 --> 47:39.291
Oh, my God.

49:04.376 --> 49:06.180
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Hurry up! Quick!

49:06.204 --> 49:07.379
Go, go, go.

49:58.212 --> 49:59.692
Shadow and the clown
are leaving.

49:59.735 --> 50:01.911
Val, get down here, now!

50:18.189 --> 50:21.583
- Which way are they heading?
- They're heading towards us.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.510
- What are you doing?
- We're gonna get them.

50:35.554 --> 50:38.078
- What?
- They have bombs.

50:38.122 --> 50:39.795
Can we just leave it
to the police this time?

50:39.819 --> 50:41.864
Everybody just hang on,
I've got a plan.

53:08.359 --> 53:10.274
- Get on the roof.
- What for?

53:10.317 --> 53:11.927
Just do it, trust me.

53:11.971 --> 53:13.451
Come on!

53:36.038 --> 53:38.389
- Wawan, you ready?
- What?

53:38.432 --> 53:40.391
- Camera!
- OK.

53:48.921 --> 53:50.923
- What now?
- Jump!

53:50.966 --> 53:53.882
- Jump what?
- I said, "Jump!"

53:53.926 --> 53:56.233
- That's your plan?
- Jump!

53:56.276 --> 53:58.496
Jump now, like... Like Batman.

54:30.615 --> 54:31.746
You getting this?

54:38.797 --> 54:39.972
Bono...

55:14.267 --> 55:15.573
Valentine!

55:23.407 --> 55:25.060
What is that?

55:38.683 --> 55:40.772
Quick, come on, come on!

56:46.490 --> 56:47.969
I'm not Batman.

56:55.368 --> 56:57.544
You can do this.

56:59.459 --> 57:01.330
Never mind.

57:01.374 --> 57:02.593
I quit!

57:22.874 --> 57:27.008
♪ The daddy's on the bus
say I love you ♪

57:27.052 --> 57:30.838
♪ I love you, I love you ♪

57:38.019 --> 57:39.760
A year ago,

57:39.804 --> 57:42.459
Bono and his family
were in an accident.

57:44.504 --> 57:46.158
They got into a car crash

57:46.201 --> 57:48.595
with some robbers who were
running from the police.

57:53.382 --> 57:56.081
So Valentine was
his daughter's name?

57:56.124 --> 57:57.474
Yeah.

57:57.517 --> 58:00.955
She was seven when she died.

58:00.999 --> 58:03.610
Bono thought that if someone
had been there to help,

58:03.654 --> 58:06.308
maybe his family would
still be alive today.

58:06.352 --> 58:08.354
But I'm not helping.

58:08.397 --> 58:12.271
Even when Valentine was there,
36 officers wound up dead.

58:12.314 --> 58:15.448
And every single one of
those families are mourning!

58:17.058 --> 58:20.584
But because of Valentine, a lot
more families don't have to.

58:24.588 --> 58:26.067
Sri.

58:43.084 --> 58:45.913
You always told me
to face my fears.

58:47.872 --> 58:51.136
And that there was nothing that
you hated more than cowards.

58:52.485 --> 58:55.183
In order to defeat our enemies,

58:57.838 --> 59:00.537
we must first defeat
the enemies within us.

59:25.300 --> 59:28.477
But then,
why couldn't you be brave?

59:31.655 --> 59:33.570
I don't understand.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.589
I don't want to be scared.

59:53.633 --> 59:55.722
What if I can't make it stop?

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.276
A shocking turn of event

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.365
at the Batavia penitentiary
tonight.

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:32.629
Let's move over to Selly
for the full story.

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:34.543
According to the witness,

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.807
the criminal known as Shadow
has freed the inmates

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.286
from the penitentiary.

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.854
this was the largest...

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:03.224
Don't move!

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:05.966
Shut up! Stay where you are!

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:08.708
- Please!
- Shut up!

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:12.407
Shut up! Back off!
Don't come any closer!

01:01:12.451 --> 01:01:15.323
Shut up!

01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:17.369
If you take one more step,
I'm gonna shoot her.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:20.024
No! Please don't hurt
my daughter! I'll do...

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:22.679
Shut up! I'll kill her!
Back off!

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.637
Please just let my baby go!

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.049
Oh, my God.

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.623
Hang in there. Please.

01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:57.278
Please hold on,
you're going to be OK.

01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.674
- Mom.
- Just hold on.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.763
We're going to
get you some help.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.591
Someone!

01:02:05.634 --> 01:02:08.463
Someone help us!
Someone help!

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:15.775
"I have fought a good fight.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.647
I have finished my course.

01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:20.693
I have kept the faith.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:24.175
Then, shall the dust return.

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:27.134
The spirit shall return
onto God."

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.704
I'm sorry.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:04.150
39 seconds this time.

01:07:04.194 --> 01:07:06.041
Oh, yeah, will Safety First
really gonna back up

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.893
the royal guard tonight?

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:11.201
Yeah.
Isn't your division coming too?

01:07:12.637 --> 01:07:15.857
Listen, man.
Just be careful out there.

01:07:15.901 --> 01:07:19.209
Shadow's gonna be looking
for events with lots of cops.

01:07:19.252 --> 01:07:21.733
You never know
what could happen.

01:07:21.776 --> 01:07:25.345
That's true. I've been
watching the news lately.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.001
You don't need to worry.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.656
Let's just both agree to
watch out for each other, OK?

01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:33.658
Will do.

01:10:05.853 --> 01:10:07.159
Stand by.

01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:25.221
Man.

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:30.835
- You got a package.
- Thanks.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.916
In the last few months,

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.657
it's been getting
harder and harder

01:11:10.701 --> 01:11:12.572
to misinterpret
the signs that our world

01:11:12.616 --> 01:11:14.748
is spinning out of kilter.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:17.403
Major cities
in North and South America,

01:11:17.447 --> 01:11:20.450
Asia and Australia
are nearly out of water

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:24.105
due to massive droughts
and melting glaciers.

01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:26.107
This is our moment.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:29.502
This is the time for those
who see and care and understand

01:11:29.546 --> 01:11:31.635
and are willing to
work to say, "This time,

01:11:31.678 --> 01:11:34.333
the warnings
will not be ignored.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:36.292
This time, we will prepare.

01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:39.512
This time, we will rise to the
occasion, and we will prevail!"

01:12:00.141 --> 01:12:02.579
Watch closely behind me.

01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:16.288
I could blow up
this building right now.

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:21.467
But I'm certain
you would all prefer it...

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:26.080
if I told you what
my demands are instead.

01:12:30.433 --> 01:12:33.610
Shadow is back in action.
Eco Green, Batavia South-side.

01:12:38.615 --> 01:12:42.358
If you choose
to make things difficult...

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:53.238
I will make sure
this ends in fire.

01:12:57.808 --> 01:13:00.593
Make sure to capture this,
Miss Selly.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:05.598
I'm sure you could all offer me
a thousand reasons

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:08.296
not to end your lives.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:13.650
But those reasons
are meaningless.

01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:17.305
There is only one way
to prevent this tragedy.

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:20.874
I demand that you bring me...

01:13:22.136 --> 01:13:25.096
Police Commissioner Syamsul.

01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:41.895
- Yes, sir!
- Now!

01:13:43.854 --> 01:13:45.421
Follow me!

01:13:48.815 --> 01:13:51.296
Everyone in position!

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:56.127
- Prepare to force entry!
- Commissioner.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:58.085
What's the status?

01:13:58.129 --> 01:13:59.870
Shadow has a hostage.

01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:01.828
He's taken the prince.

01:14:01.872 --> 01:14:04.483
If these criminals
want to start a war,

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:07.007
- Then, we'll give them one!
- But, sir...

01:14:07.051 --> 01:14:11.185
- Prepare an infiltration squad!
- Sir, yes, sir!

01:14:12.273 --> 01:14:14.450
That damn psychopath!

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.669
Let's move!

01:18:46.939 --> 01:18:48.201
Hey!

01:21:03.467 --> 01:21:05.643
Umbra, you don't
have to do this.

01:21:05.686 --> 01:21:07.863
I have all the evidence here.

01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:09.777
You're right to be angry.

01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:11.867
But let me help you get justice.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.705
Looks like you're surrounded,
Umbra. On your knees.

01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:27.056
Take another step, and he dies.

01:21:40.591 --> 01:21:43.811
Or would you prefer
we make an arrangement?

01:21:43.855 --> 01:21:45.944
What's the matter, chief?
Don't have the guts?

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.554
Don't you play games with me.

01:21:47.598 --> 01:21:49.382
Oh, I think
we're well past that.

01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:51.080
Then tell me your demands.

01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:54.039
There's only
one things that I want.

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:57.129
It's you. I'll trade you

01:21:57.173 --> 01:21:59.523
for this royal guest.

01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:02.830
You want to take away
this city's symbol of order?

01:22:02.874 --> 01:22:05.007
If I comply
with a thug like you,

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.966
it shows that our city
negotiates with terrorists.

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:11.578
Oh, really?
You think you're so special?

01:22:13.319 --> 01:22:15.539
If you die here tonight,

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.846
you'll be replaced
and forgotten.

01:22:20.326 --> 01:22:22.459
It's time for you
to make a choice.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.831
Tell your men to back off.

01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:52.402
Fall back! Everyone back!

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:55.709
All units retreat!

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:03.891
You want to know
the real reason

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:07.199
why all of these horrible things
have happened in this city?

01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.552
Tell them the truth

01:23:12.596 --> 01:23:14.946
about that day in 2010.

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:20.343
Explain why this city can
no longer trust the police.

01:23:20.386 --> 01:23:22.910
I want them to see
what a monster you are!

01:23:24.695 --> 01:23:26.479
Confess.

01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:39.449
Five years ago,

01:23:39.492 --> 01:23:41.886
when I was
the District Chief...

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:46.238
Does our friendship

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:47.761
mean nothing to you?

01:23:53.593 --> 01:23:56.944
I told you, Buma.
Don't worry about it.

01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:58.381
Don't worry about it?

01:23:58.424 --> 01:24:00.818
Syam, you sold
confiscated evidence!

01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:02.428
You committed a serious crime!

01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:05.040
Do you know what could
happen because of that?

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:08.130
These weapons will just make
the crime rates worse again.

01:24:08.173 --> 01:24:10.045
This could endanger our wives,

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:13.352
our children, our families,
the entire city!

01:24:13.396 --> 01:24:17.182
We are the police! Where
the hell is your conscience?

01:24:17.226 --> 01:24:20.620
Sooner or later,
someone is gonna find out!

01:24:22.013 --> 01:24:25.973
Buma, for old time's sake,

01:24:27.366 --> 01:24:28.889
just walk away from this.

01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.630
That's impossible.

01:24:32.719 --> 01:24:35.374
Buma, have you forgotten?

01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:38.029
The three of us were delinquents
who joined the police

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.814
so we could control our destiny!

01:24:40.858 --> 01:24:44.818
We're the same.
How dare you try to lecture me?

01:24:44.862 --> 01:24:46.777
Never!

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:48.561
I'm nothing like you.

01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:27.600
This is OP1, sir.

01:25:33.519 --> 01:25:35.304
Umbra...

01:25:49.666 --> 01:25:51.146
Take care of Mom.

01:27:17.057 --> 01:27:20.844
Four, three, two, one.

01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:26.893
At this time, we have confirmed
the death of the criminal

01:27:26.937 --> 01:27:29.418
known as Shadow
from a police sniper's round.

01:27:29.461 --> 01:27:32.116
New evidence discovered
by police inspector Lukman

01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:35.815
has revealed Shadow's identity to be Umbra Bumantara,

01:27:35.859 --> 01:27:38.775
the son of the late
Inspector General Bumantara.

01:27:38.818 --> 01:27:41.647
Five years ago, the death of
Inspector Bumantara

01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:44.607
was closely related to
an illegal weapons deal,

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.218
that disadvantaged
the country at a total cost

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.655
of nearly 250 billion rupiah.

01:27:49.699 --> 01:27:52.745
New evidence discovered
by Inspector Lukman, however,

01:27:52.789 --> 01:27:55.531
has revealed that the deal
was actually setup

01:27:55.574 --> 01:27:58.055
by Bumantara's colleagues
at that time.

01:27:58.098 --> 01:28:01.580
Commissioner General Syamsul
and General Bambang.

01:28:01.624 --> 01:28:04.148
They set this tragic
scandal in motion

01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:06.846
using Inspector Bumantara
as a scapegoat

01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:08.544
for the entire operation.

01:28:08.587 --> 01:28:11.286
Umbra, the man we now
know as Shadow,

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:14.114
terrorized Batavia City
as his method to punish

01:28:14.158 --> 01:28:15.638
the very same police department

01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:17.422
that caused the death
of his father.

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:19.685
It's difficult to
justify his actions,

01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:21.513
but we at Channel 11
understand...

01:28:22.558 --> 01:28:23.210
Shadow, the terror

01:28:23.254 --> 01:28:25.038
of Batavia City

01:28:25.082 --> 01:28:28.303
has cast a light upon the
despicable crime committed...

01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:30.305
...Syamsul sacrificed himself,

01:28:30.348 --> 01:28:31.480
dying at Shadow's hand

01:28:31.523 --> 01:28:33.308
to save the royal prince's life

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:35.527
and to return honor
to the police department.

01:28:35.571 --> 01:28:36.591
The people of Batavia

01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:37.877
have expressed their gratitude

01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:40.576
to the police,
especially Syamsul,

01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:42.534
for their actions
in protecting the city

01:28:42.578 --> 01:28:44.623
and fighting back against
the numerous crimes

01:28:44.667 --> 01:28:47.539
conducted by
Shadow's syndicate.

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.628
Even though the city
mourns as one for the death of

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:51.500
Commissioner General Syamsul,

01:28:51.543 --> 01:28:54.633
we know now that Bumantara was
set up by his own colleagues.

01:28:54.677 --> 01:28:56.243
Commissioner Syamsul...

01:28:56.287 --> 01:28:58.550
Commissioner Bumantara
was a victim.

01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:00.944
Today, he gets
his good name back.

01:29:00.987 --> 01:29:03.120
but what about the misery
that has come to the people

01:29:03.163 --> 01:29:05.601
of this city in the wake
of that tragedy?

01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:07.472
Inspector.

01:30:16.236 --> 01:30:18.587
This is not the end.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.112
Life has many trials.

01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:26.856
It's up to us to find
the strength within ourselves.

01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:29.162
The strength to overcome them.

01:30:31.034 --> 01:30:32.470
Even if it feels like

01:30:32.514 --> 01:30:35.430
everything around you
is falling apart,

01:30:35.473 --> 01:30:38.128
it does not mean
you have to fall apart too.

01:30:41.523 --> 01:30:43.220
It's true. You don't always

01:30:43.263 --> 01:30:46.049
get to choose what kind
of person you become.

01:30:46.092 --> 01:30:47.964
But sometimes,

01:30:48.007 --> 01:30:50.967
fate has its own plans
to make you even better

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:53.796
than you ever thought possible.

01:31:15.687 --> 01:31:18.690
This is not
the end of my story.

01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:22.433
This is only the beginning.
