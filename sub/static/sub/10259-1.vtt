[ Snorting ]

02:30.616 --> 02:33.813
[ Narrator ] This is a tale about
an unprejudiced heart...

02:33.886 --> 02:37.185
and how it changed our valley forever.

02:37.256 --> 02:39.520
There was a time not so long ago...

02:39.592 --> 02:44.029
when pigs were afforded no respect
except by other pigs.

02:44.096 --> 02:49.261
They lived their whole lives
in a cruel and sunless world.

03:03.015 --> 03:08.214
In those days, pigs believed that
the sooner they grew large and fat,

03:08.287 --> 03:11.017
the sooner they'd be taken
into pig paradise.

03:11.090 --> 03:14.753
Haa! Haa! Get up!
A place so wonderful...

03:14.827 --> 03:18.957
that no pig had ever
thought to come back.
Yo! Yeah!

03:26.372 --> 03:30.001
Good-bye, Mom.

03:30.076 --> 03:35.605
So when the day came for their
parents to go to that other
world of endless pleasures,

03:35.681 --> 03:38.548
it was not a time
for young pigs to be sad.

03:38.618 --> 03:43.681
Just another step towards the day when
they, too, would make the journey.

03:56.235 --> 04:00.569
[ Sobbing ]
perhaps it was because he was alone.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.098
perhaps his sadness
made him easier to catch.

04:04.176 --> 04:07.668
Whatever the reason, of the thousands
of animals in the piggery that day...

04:07.747 --> 04:10.443
only one was chosen.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.711
How's this one, Harry?
Just right for the purpose.

04:12.785 --> 04:16.983
How much do I owe you?
It's a runt, Harry.
A worthless, little runt.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.853
[ Chuckling ]
[ Pig Squealing ]

04:19.925 --> 04:22.894
[ Screaming ]

04:28.334 --> 04:32.270
[ Auctioneer chattering ]

04:32.338 --> 04:35.603
[ Chuckling ]
You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.

04:35.675 --> 04:38.109
Nine out of 10 first prizes
for jams and jellies...

04:38.177 --> 04:40.111
is more than a matter of luck.

04:40.179 --> 04:43.774
Luck still plays its part. Our berries
were wickedly good this year.

04:43.849 --> 04:46.443
And our water is very tasty too.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.249
Of course, we don't use
the town water.

04:49.321 --> 04:51.789
[ Pig Squealing ]

04:51.857 --> 04:55.987
Arthur Hoggett!
How's it going, Arthur?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.462
How are those sheep of yours?
Come on, try your luck.

04:58.531 --> 05:02.262
How about taking a guess, Arthur?
All for a good cause.

05:04.704 --> 05:10.609
- Don't keep pigs.
- Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!

05:10.676 --> 05:13.270
That'll do, Pig.

05:16.048 --> 05:20.747
[ Narrator ] The pig and the farmer
regarded each other.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.449
And for a fleeting moment,
something passed between them.

05:24.523 --> 05:29.460
A faint sense of some common destiny.
[ Man ] Hah. Strange.

05:29.528 --> 05:32.053
First time the little thing
hasn't screamed its head off.

05:32.131 --> 05:36.795
Now you'll have to have a guess.

05:36.869 --> 05:41.465
Sixteen pounds, five--
[ Pig Urinating ]

05:41.540 --> 05:43.667
Eew.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.981
Two ounces.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.448
[ Mrs. Hoggett ]
Hooey! Hoggett!

05:58.524 --> 06:00.424
Hooey! Hoggett!

06:00.493 --> 06:03.985
Thanks, Arthur. We'll be weighing
the little pig tomorrow.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.361
We'll phone you if you win.

06:06.432 --> 06:10.493
When you win, Arthur.
When you win! [ Laughing ]

06:10.569 --> 06:12.594
Care to guess the pig's weight, sir?

06:12.671 --> 06:14.832
Support the Lion's Club.

06:23.349 --> 06:26.182
[ clock Ticking ]

06:35.861 --> 06:37.954
[ Huffs ]

06:38.030 --> 06:40.055
Ooh!
[ Chuckles ]

06:40.132 --> 06:42.066
What could we do
with a pig, eh, Duchess?

06:42.134 --> 06:45.365
Just think. Two nice hams.
Two sides of bacon.

06:45.437 --> 06:50.067
Oh, and pork chops, kidney, liver,
chitlins, pickle his feet.

06:50.142 --> 06:53.043
[ phone rings ]
Save his blood for black puddin'.
There's the telephone.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.773
Hoggett!

06:54.847 --> 06:58.408
[ Man ] Good news, Arthur.
You've won the pig.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.748
Oh.

07:03.155 --> 07:07.353
[ Mouse ] pigs are definitely stupid.
[ Giggling ]

07:19.738 --> 07:22.400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.110
[ Puppy ] What is it, Mom?
That's a pig.

07:27.179 --> 07:29.704
They'll eat him when he's big.
Will they eat us?

07:29.782 --> 07:33.741
Good heavens, no! The bosses
only eat stupid animals...

07:33.819 --> 07:36.344
like sheep and ducks and chickens.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.913
[ puppies Barking ]
Yea!

07:45.164 --> 07:47.792
It does look stupid, Mom.

07:47.867 --> 07:51.735
Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.
But pigs are definitely stupid.

07:51.804 --> 07:55.262
Excuse me. No, we're not.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.367
- Good heavens! Who are you?
- I'm a large White.

07:58.444 --> 08:01.777
- Yes, that's your breed, dear.
What's your name?
- I don't know.

08:01.847 --> 08:06.113
What did your mother call you
to tell you apart from
your brothers and sisters?

08:06.185 --> 08:08.312
Our mom called us all the same.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.150
And what was that, dear?

08:10.222 --> 08:12.622
She called us all Babe.

08:12.691 --> 08:15.956
Perhaps we shouldn't talk
too much about, uh, family.

08:16.028 --> 08:21.330
[ Crying ]
I want my mom.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.892
[ Whimpering ]

08:24.970 --> 08:28.736
There, there. You've got
to be a brave boy now.

08:28.807 --> 08:33.073
I left my mother when I was your age,
and my pups will have to leave me soon.

08:33.145 --> 08:37.445
But I'll keep an eye on you, if you like,
just 'til you find your feet.

08:41.754 --> 08:45.121
The little pig's a bit low.
He's going to sleep with us...

08:45.190 --> 08:48.250
just 'til he finds his feet.
[ Snarls ]

08:52.765 --> 08:55.962
Until he finds his feet.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.471
But, Mom, he'll wet the bed!

09:00.539 --> 09:02.336
Nonsense!

09:02.408 --> 09:05.536
If you do want to do anything,
you'll go outside, won't you?

09:05.611 --> 09:10.275
[ Sniffling ]
Good boy.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.442
[ puppies Together ]
Yea!

09:12.518 --> 09:16.113
Yeah! Yeah!
Stomp on him!

09:16.188 --> 09:18.850
What's your name, Pig?

09:18.924 --> 09:22.257
What does he taste like?
Where did he come from?

09:35.774 --> 09:39.710
[ Clucking ]

09:43.449 --> 09:48.148
Comin' through!
Hey, get lost!

- [ Duck Crowing ]

09:52.891 --> 09:55.359
[ Crowing Continues ]

09:55.427 --> 09:57.895
We've got to do something
about that duck.

09:57.963 --> 10:00.989
Ooh! Ooh!

10:01.066 --> 10:03.034
Doodle-loo-dee-doo.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.093
What's that noise?
It's only Ferdinand.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.104
What's Ferdinand?
He's a duck.

10:07.172 --> 10:10.164
He wants to be a rooster.
He hates being a duck.

10:10.242 --> 10:13.609
We'll catch him one day
and eat him. Won't we, Mom?

10:13.679 --> 10:16.204
Yes, dear.

10:16.281 --> 10:19.717
Yech!
Who'd want to eat a duck?

10:24.490 --> 10:26.458
[ Whistles ]

10:26.525 --> 10:29.517
[ Yipping ]

10:44.610 --> 10:47.773
Babe,you wait here.

10:47.846 --> 10:50.212
- Aren't pigs allowed?
- Not live ones.

10:50.282 --> 10:53.274
Sorry, dear. Only dogs
and cats inside the house.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.820
- Why?
- That's just the way things are.

10:59.124 --> 11:02.218
[ Purring ]

- [ Screeching ]
- [ Barking ]

11:10.903 --> 11:12.768
Whoa!

11:12.838 --> 11:14.999
[ Babe Groaning ]

11:15.074 --> 11:18.168
Ow!
[ Mrs. Hoggett ] pig-pig-piggy!

11:18.243 --> 11:21.610
Ooh, what a spectacular feast
I've got for you.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.740
Oh, yes! What a lucky
little pork chop you are.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.411
Delicious! Oh, yes!
Yum, yum, yum.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.852
Who's gonna grow up
to be a big, fat pig?

11:29.922 --> 11:34.018
You are! You are!
Yum, yum, yum.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.999
[ puppy ] Where are we going?
To work with the sheep.

11:46.071 --> 11:49.165
- What's sheep?
- Sheep is animals
with thick, woolly coats.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.766
And thick woolly heads. And men
can't look after them without us.

11:51.844 --> 11:57.305
Why do they need us?
[ Together ] 'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yea!

12:09.461 --> 12:11.793
- Not you, dear.
- Why not?

12:11.864 --> 12:16.563
We have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.
Your job is to stay here and eat your food.

12:16.635 --> 12:19.798
We'll be back
at the end of the day.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.614
[ Female Voice ] They don't think
I'll remember. Well, I don't forget.

12:31.683 --> 12:34.675
Seems like a sheep's
just born to suffer.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.153
Hello? Excuse me.

12:37.222 --> 12:39.213
[ Coughing ]
Darn wolf!

12:39.291 --> 12:43.751
- I 'm not a wolf. I'm a pig.
What are you?
- Ewe.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.854
Pig. What are you?

12:45.931 --> 12:48.764
I'm a ewe. A ewe!

12:48.834 --> 12:52.930
You're a sheep!
I'll not be called a common sheep,
thank you kindly.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.667
I'm a Border Leicester ewe.
The name's maa.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.403
[ Coughing ]
Oh.

12:58.477 --> 13:02.470
- What's wrong with you, Maa?
- Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.

13:02.548 --> 13:06.746
And I'm not as young
as I used to be. [ Coughing ]

13:06.818 --> 13:10.811
[ Coughing, Bleating ]

13:10.889 --> 13:12.823
Hmph.

13:12.891 --> 13:16.190
â™ªâ™ª [ Humming ]

13:16.261 --> 13:19.753
- Seem like a nice young pig.
What be your name?
- Babe.

13:19.831 --> 13:22.698
Not like them wolves.
Treat you like dirt, they do!

13:22.768 --> 13:25.828
Bite you as soon as
look at you, those savages!
Bite you?

13:25.904 --> 13:28.372
And worse.
Some wolves be so bad,

13:28.440 --> 13:30.738
they run a sheep down
and tear it to pieces.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.243
[ coughing ]
Fly would never do that!

13:33.312 --> 13:37.146
Fly, is it? A right vicious creature
she be, I'll tell you.

13:37.216 --> 13:41.152
- Not Fly.
- All them wolves is cruel to sheep.
Always have been.

13:41.220 --> 13:44.053
Brutal savages!
That's what they be.

13:44.122 --> 13:48.388
I wouldn't want to see a gentle soul
like you mixin' with the likes of them.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.621
[ coughing ]

14:00.239 --> 14:02.730
[ Narrator ]
That afternoon when he saw Fly,

14:02.808 --> 14:06.005
the pig's mind
was a tangle of questions.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.241
cruel, vicious, brutal?

14:09.314 --> 14:13.250
What was it that dogs did
in the fields all day?

14:13.318 --> 14:17.618
- Hello, Babe? Had a good day?
- Yes, thank you.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.793
[ Giggling ]

14:26.865 --> 14:31.029
[ Narrator ] The old sheep
had to be wrong about Fly.

14:31.103 --> 14:36.769
And the pig promised himself
that he would never think badly
of any creature ever again.

14:40.178 --> 14:43.511
Crime and Punishment!
[ Laughing ]

14:43.582 --> 14:46.608
The morning of the terrible crime...

14:46.685 --> 14:49.449
started like any other
on Hoggett Farm.

14:49.521 --> 14:52.490
Comin' through!
Comin' through! [ Clucking ]

14:52.557 --> 14:54.718
Take off!

14:57.562 --> 15:00.395
- [ Chuckles ] Now!
- Up, up, up.

15:00.465 --> 15:02.990
- [ Clucking ]
- Nee-nee-nee-nee.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.729
- [ crowing ]
-[ Alarm ringing ]
- Hmm?

15:04.803 --> 15:08.830
I was worried it might have
a harsh tone, but that's
quite a nice musical ring.

15:08.907 --> 15:13.173
I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware,
and there it was waiting for me.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.372
What a splendid way
to wake up each morning!

15:15.447 --> 15:17.972
Hoggett, dear. Church.

15:24.956 --> 15:27.925
[ Narrator ] When embarking
on an audacious crime,

15:27.993 --> 15:30.723
a duck needs a willing accomplice.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.765
A creature who is reliable,
beyond suspicion,

15:33.832 --> 15:36.198
and above all... extremely gullible.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.202
Hey! Psst!

15:38.270 --> 15:40.329
Wha-- What?

15:40.405 --> 15:43.568
You look like an intelligent,
sophisticated, discerning young fella.

15:43.642 --> 15:48.670
- Who, me?
- Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy!
Are you in for some fun!

15:48.747 --> 15:53.582
What are we doin'?
Where are we goin'?

15:53.652 --> 15:56.712
[ Narrator ] Now the duck knew
exactly what he had to do.

15:56.788 --> 16:00.485
The alarm clock had to go.
His very life depended on it.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.756
-[ Duck ] Do you see it?
- Yes.

16:03.829 --> 16:05.763
Good.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.994
[ Babe ] So I go through the kitchen,
across the living room...

16:09.067 --> 16:11.262
Good, good.
into the bedroom.

16:11.336 --> 16:13.770
Get the mechanical rooster
and bring it out to you.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.808
- What about that cat?
- But quietly bring it out to you.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.139
Excellent.
I don't think I can do it.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.442
It's against the rules. Only dogs
and cats allowed in the house.

16:22.514 --> 16:26.951
It's a good rule, but this is bigger
than rules. This is life and death.

16:27.018 --> 16:31.011
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Follow me.

16:31.089 --> 16:34.490
[ Duck ] Hello! Look,
there's something you should know.

16:34.559 --> 16:38.290
- Humans eat ducks!
- [ Gasps ] I beg your pardon?

16:38.363 --> 16:42.493
Most ducks prefer to forget it,
but the fact is that humans
like to eat plump ducks.

16:42.567 --> 16:45.764
I don't think so.
Not the boss. Not the boss's wife.

16:45.837 --> 16:48.533
Come on.
Humans don't eat cats. Why?

16:48.607 --> 16:50.837
- Well, they're--
- They're indispensable.
They catch mice.

16:50.909 --> 16:55.278
Humans don't eat roosters. Why?
They make eggs with the hens and
wake everyone up in the morning.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.281
I tried it with the hens.
It didn't work.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.182
So I turned to crowing, and lo!
I discover my gift.

17:00.252 --> 17:04.415
But no sooner do I become
indispensable then they bring in
a machine to do the job!

17:04.489 --> 17:06.923
[ Moaning ]
Ah, the treachery of it!

17:06.992 --> 17:09.756
A mechanical rooster!
Oh, dear me.

17:09.828 --> 17:13.594
Oh, dear you?
[ Sighing ]

17:13.665 --> 17:16.224
I suppose the life
of an anorexic duck...

17:16.300 --> 17:19.202
doesn't amount to much
in the broad scheme of things.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.296
But, pig,

17:21.373 --> 17:24.171
I'm all I've got.

the winter rains brought
a great flood to the valley.

Rex and the boss got most of
the flock onto the high ground.

Then Rex went back
to look for the strays.

He found them. They'd been
stranded by the rising water.

to safety, but they wouldn't budge.

and the water kept rising.

right through the night.

By morning, the sheep were drowned.

before the Grand National Challenge.
