WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:09.343
( crossing bell ringing )

00:19.787 --> 00:21.489
HI.

00:25.893 --> 00:29.897
THIS IS ROSIE'S--
ROSIE'S BAG

00:29.997 --> 00:32.833
AND I GOT HER
THIS SMALL THING.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.269
OH, THAT'S SWEET.
THANKS, PAUL.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.272
WELL, I-- I HAVE
TO GET BACK.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.741
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
LEAVING THOSE KIDS ALONE--
THEY NEVER STOP FIGHTING.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.212
- OH, WONDER WHERE
THEY LEARNED THAT FROM.
- ( chuckles )

00:45.946 --> 00:48.082
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
- NO, LET ME GET IT.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.286
- WHERE'S THE CAR?
- IT'S JUST OVER HERE.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.323
LISTEN, PAUL, I--

00:55.423 --> 00:58.192
I'M REALLY SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.394
I KNOW I'VE ALREADY
SAID THAT, BUT--

01:00.494 --> 01:04.064
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT
YOU CAME TO THE FUNERAL.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.066
I REALLY DO.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.936
AND THAT YOU LET THE KIDS
COME FOR THAT WEEKEND.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.239
IT WAS-- IT WAS GREAT.

01:11.339 --> 01:14.475
- THEY DIDN'T DRIVE YOU CRAZY?
- UH...

01:15.509 --> 01:17.445
NO, IT FELT GOOD
TO BE WITH THEM.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.580
YOU KNOW?
LIKE THINGS ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.284
THEY WANTED TO BE THERE.
THEY'RE GOOD KIDS, YOU KNOW?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.953
AND YOU WERE GOOD
TO ME TOO, KATE.

01:26.053 --> 01:29.123
WE FELT LIKE--
LIKE A FAMILY.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.659
I FELT IT TOO.

01:31.759 --> 01:35.129
IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE
THAT IT TOOK SUCH
A SAD SITUATION--

01:35.229 --> 01:39.267
THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO SAY, KATE.

01:41.135 --> 01:44.205
I WANT US TO TRY IT
AGAIN-- YOU KNOW,

01:44.305 --> 01:48.276
BEING A FAMILY.
I MISS YOU, KATE.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.513
I WANT TO COME HOME.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.484
I LOVE YOU, KATE.

01:56.584 --> 02:00.188
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE
OURSELVES ANOTHER CHANCE.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.723
I KNOW THE KIDS
WANT US TO DO IT.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.626
SO DO I.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.662
OH, PAUL.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.267
I'M SEEING SOMEBODY.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.004
I MIGHT BE
IN LOVE WITH HIM.
I DON'T KNOW.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.740
I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN.
I JUST CAN'T.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.679
AND I'M SO SORRY.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.883
( car door slams )

02:29.983 --> 02:32.186
( engine starts )

02:33.854 --> 02:37.191
( car departs )

02:38.058 --> 02:40.661
( theme music playing )

03:01.882 --> 03:04.518
- PAUL.
- HI, GINA.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.888
HOW ARE YOU?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.857
I'M, UH...

03:09.957 --> 03:12.526
I'M OKAY, THANKS.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.663
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME TEA
OR SOME WATER?

03:15.763 --> 03:18.866
UH...
WATER'LL BE FINE.
THANKS.

03:24.805 --> 03:28.642
UH, THANKS FOR
THE ORCHID THAT YOU SENT.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.380
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT.
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.316
IT'S A PITY
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

03:35.416 --> 03:39.052
PAUL,
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
MY PLACE TO BE THERE.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.490
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS
A NICE SERVICE...

03:43.691 --> 03:47.261
EXCEPT FOR THE PRIEST'S
CELL PHONE GOING OFF.

03:47.361 --> 03:51.565
MY KIDS SPOKE.
THEY EACH HAD A--

03:51.665 --> 03:54.067
MEMORY TO TELL.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.570
AND SOME PEOPLE
FROM THE NURSING HOME CAME.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.608
THEY TALKED ABOUT
HIS CARD PLAYING
AND HIS SINGING.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.910
DID YOU EVER HEAR HIM SING
WHEN YOU WERE A BOY?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.445
NOT THAT I REMEMBER.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.281
BUT ONE OF THE SURGICAL
NURSES SAID THAT,

04:07.381 --> 04:10.250
YOU KNOW, HE USED TO SING
IN THE OPERATING ROOM.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.920
"A FINE IRISH TENOR,"
SHE SAID HE WAS.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.257
OF COURSE THERE WAS A LOT
OF WOMEN AT THE FUNERAL.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.827
WOMEN REALLY LIKED MY DAD,
AS YOU KNOW.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.998
YES, THEN TOO, WOMEN LIVE
LONGER THAN MEN

04:25.098 --> 04:26.634
SO WHEN YOU GET
TO A CERTAIN AGE,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.737
THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING
TO BE MORE WOMEN
AT FUNERALS.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.240
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE DECIDED?
WOMEN ARE REALLY GOOD AT LOSS.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.377
MEN DON'T REALLY--
THEY HAVEN'T GOT
A FUCKING CLUE.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.047
DID YOU GET TO SPEAK
TO YOUR FATHER
BEFORE HE DIED?

04:40.147 --> 04:42.983
YOU KNOW, FOR MEN

04:43.083 --> 04:45.386
LOSS IS-- IT'S A DEFEAT.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.022
IN A GAME OR A FIGHT,

04:49.122 --> 04:52.460
LOSING MAKES YOU MAD.
YOU WANT TO GET EVEN
WITH THE GUY.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.563
LIKE THIS MAN WHO'S SUING ME--
ALEX'S FATHER.

04:55.663 --> 04:59.299
THIS GUY IS SO ANGRY
THAT ALL HE CAN THINK OF

04:59.400 --> 05:01.234
IS COMING AFTER ME.

05:01.335 --> 05:04.538
- LIKE THAT'S GONNA HELP.
- PAUL, ARE YOU TRYING

05:04.638 --> 05:07.007
TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO GRIEVE
FOR YOUR FATHER?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.076
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.311
WHAT OTHER THINGS?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.080
ONE OF THE THINGS
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

05:13.180 --> 05:16.517
IS HOW I CAN HELP MY PATIENTS
WITH DEATH AND DYING

05:16.617 --> 05:19.487
WHEN I MYSELF
HAVE BEEN SO STUPID

05:19.587 --> 05:21.321
AND SO WRONG ABOUT IT.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.591
YOU KNOW, PAUL, IT HASN'T
EVEN BEEN TWO WEEKS.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.794
- YOU WON'T ALWAYS
FEEL THIS RAW.
- WE'LL SEE.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.196
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE FUNERAL?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.264
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS NOW,

05:31.365 --> 05:33.100
WHEN YOU'VE JUST BEEN
THROUGH THIS.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.537
DO YOU NOT THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO TALK ABOUT MY PATIENTS?

05:36.637 --> 05:40.974
HOW AM I GOING TO HELP
MY PATIENTS IF MY OWN
LIFE IS IN A MESS?

05:41.074 --> 05:43.577
I MEAN, WOULD YOU USE
A PLUMBER IF YOU FOUND OUT

05:43.677 --> 05:48.081
- THAT ALL THE DRAINS
IN HIS HOUSE WERE BLOCKED?
- IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.384
YOU'RE A TRAINED
PSYCHOTHERAPIST.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.386
BUT NOT A TRAINED HUSBAND,
FATHER OR SON.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.787
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.591
AS A MAN, YOU'RE LIKE
AN ANIMAL IN THE WILD.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.194
YOU'RE LIVING DAY TO DAY,
YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT
YOUR TERRITORY

06:01.294 --> 06:03.664
AND PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY.

06:03.764 --> 06:07.935
AS A THERAPIST,
YOU'RE OBSERVING
CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE HERD

06:08.035 --> 06:09.803
THROUGH BINOCULARS.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.040
THESE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT
WAYS OF EXPERIENCING LIFE.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.944
BUT YOU CAN'T OBSERVE YOURSELF
THROUGH YOUR OWN BINOCULARS.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.812
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.581
RIGHT.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.184
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE FUNERAL?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.286
OH, GINA,
NOT THIS WEEK, PLEASE.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.221
I FEEL LIKE--

06:28.321 --> 06:30.223
I FEEL
PRETTY WIPED OUT.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.159
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.695
BUT I'M INTERESTED--
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
YOU WERE GLAD

06:34.795 --> 06:36.464
THAT YOUR CHILDREN
WERE THERE.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.967
YEAH, I WAS GLAD THAT
THE BOYS WERE THERE.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.738
MAYBE THEY WON'T BE
AS STUPID AS I WAS
ABOUT IT ALL.

06:44.838 --> 06:48.408
- STUPID?
- I LEARNED MORE
ABOUT MY FATHER

06:48.509 --> 06:51.111
AT HIS FUNERAL
THAN I EVER DID
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.180
DOESN'T THAT SOUND
STUPID TO YOU?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.115
WHAT DID YOU LEARN
ABOUT HIM?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.750
OH, FOR ONE THING,

06:56.850 --> 07:00.821
I FOUND OUT THAT HE DID A LOT
OF FREE SURGERY IN BOLIVIA.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.824
- YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT ABOUT HIM?
- NO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.060
- AND HE MADE ME
EXECUTOR OF HIS ESTATE.
- DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.698
AND HE GAVE ME HIS HALF
OF A LITTLE BREWERY
IN MINNESOTA.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.366
HE OWNED A BREWERY
IN MINNESOTA?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.368
YEAH, WITH ONE OF
HIS DOCTOR FRIENDS.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.271
I GUESS HE LOANED SOME GUY
SOME START-UP MONEY

07:18.371 --> 07:19.907
40 YEARS AGO.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.476
SO IF THE LAWSUIT ENDS UP
COSTING ME MY LICENSE,

07:22.576 --> 07:25.112
I GUESS I CAN ALWAYS
GO MAKE BEER.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.016
YOU SEE WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

07:29.950 --> 07:32.085
LIKE, WHO--

07:32.185 --> 07:33.587
WHO WAS THIS MAN?

07:33.687 --> 07:35.956
ALL I KNEW WAS

07:36.056 --> 07:37.858
THIS OLD STORY
THAT I'VE TOLD YOU--

07:37.958 --> 07:39.560
THAT HE LEFT US
FOR A PATIENT,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.895
MY MOTHER KILLED HERSELF
AND I GREW UP ALONE.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.665
YET ALL THESE THINGS
ARE STILL TRUE,
AREN'T THEY?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.433
HOW THE FUCK
WOULD I KNOW?

07:46.534 --> 07:49.236
IF MY FATHER
WAS THIS GREAT GUY,

07:49.336 --> 07:51.605
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW IT?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.509
ARE YOU BEGINNING TO THINK
HE WAS A GREAT GUY?

07:55.609 --> 07:58.311
EVEN IF HE WASN'T GREAT,
AT LEAST HE WAS INTERESTING.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.714
BUT WHAT WAS I?
WAS I BLIND?

08:00.814 --> 08:04.151
PEOPLE OFTEN CAN
BE VERY SUCCESSFUL
IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD

08:04.251 --> 08:06.820
AND REMAIN
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO THEIR FAMILIES.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.989
MYSTERY IS
PUTTING IT MILDLY, GINA.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.792
I DON'T THINK HE WAS
A COMPLETE MYSTERY
TO YOU, PAUL.

08:11.892 --> 08:15.295
I THINK AS A BOY,
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ALL THE FACTS,

08:15.395 --> 08:18.198
YOU KNEW HE WAS
AN INTERESTING MAN.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.168
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE MAD
THAT HE WAS NEVER HOME.

08:21.268 --> 08:24.605
MAYBE YOU WANTED TO
LIVE WITH HIM INSTEAD
OF YOUR MOTHER.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.641
- WELL, WHO WOULDN'T?
- IT WASN'T YOUR CHOICE.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.411
PAUL, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WITH A CHOICE IN YOUR FAMILY.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.882
HE CHOSE HIS WORK,
HIS INVESTMENTS,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.550
HIS WOMEN.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.218
THAT HURT YOU.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.888
I WASN'T HURT. I JUST
HATED THE SON OF A BITCH.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.990
OH, I THINK
THE HATRED GREW

08:43.090 --> 08:45.826
SO YOU COULD PROTECT YOURSELF
FROM HIS REJECTION.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.028
I DON'T THINK YOU
ALWAYS HATED HIM.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.270
YOU THINK I LOVED HIM?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.607
I'M SAYING IT WASN'T
STUPID OF YOU

08:59.707 --> 09:02.175
NOT TO KNOW
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

09:02.275 --> 09:06.513
I MEAN, MAYBE HE DIDN'T
WANT TO CALL ATTENTION
TO HIS CHARITY WORK.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.216
OR MAYBE HE THOUGHT
HIS SINGING WAS SILLY

09:09.316 --> 09:11.184
OR THE BREWERY
WAS FRIVOLOUS.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.221
OR MAYBE HE WASN'T
HOME ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY
CONVERSATION ABOUT ANYTHING.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.825
OR MAYBE BY THE TIME
HE GOT READY TO TALK,
I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.628
ALL THESE THINGS
ARE POSSIBLE.

09:20.728 --> 09:24.632
DEATH LEAVES A LOT
OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

09:27.034 --> 09:31.438
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYBODY
HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE
A GOOD PARENT.

09:31.538 --> 09:34.474
AND SOMETIMES,
AS IN YOUR FATHER'S CASE,

09:34.574 --> 09:36.777
THE CHOICES CAN
BE VERY DIFFICULT.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.713
DO YOU GIVE YOURSELF OVER
TO YOUR SICK WIFE

09:39.813 --> 09:43.016
AND YOUR ANGRY CHILDREN
AND FIGHT A LOSING BATTLE?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.887
OR DO YOU GIVE YOURSELF
TO YOUR TALENT

09:46.987 --> 09:49.289
AND HOPE THAT SOMEDAY
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND?

09:49.389 --> 09:53.560
SO YOU'RE SAYING HIS HOME LIFE
WAS A LOSING BATTLE FOR HIM?

09:53.661 --> 09:56.496
I'M SAYING THAT HE
LOOKED AT HIS OPTIONS

09:56.596 --> 09:59.099
AND HE FOUGHT THE BATTLE
HE THOUGHT HE COULD WIN.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.035
A LESS CHARITABLE VIEW
WOULD BE

10:02.135 --> 10:04.705
THAT HE WON THE BATTLE
HE CHOSE TO FIGHT.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.675
- THAT'S TRUE.
- SO IT WASN'T STUPID OF ME

10:07.775 --> 10:10.610
TO NOT KNOW WHO MY FATHER WAS
WHEN I WAS A BOY.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.382
IT WAS STUPID
THAT I GOT TO BE THIS OLD

10:15.482 --> 10:18.085
AND STILL DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HE WAS.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.392
EVEN SITTING
THERE AT THE BEDSIDE
IN THE NURSING HOME--

10:25.492 --> 10:28.729
HE HAD MAYBE
FIVE MINUTES TO LIVE.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.234
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
IT WAS JUST ME AND HIM TOGETHER.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.206
SICKNESS UNTIL DEATH,
AND ALL THAT.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.611
( clears throat )
THE ONLY PERSON

10:44.712 --> 10:48.115
I LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT
WAS ME.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.220
I'M GLAD YOU SAW HIM
BEFORE HE DIED.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.689
IT WAS THE STRANGEST THING,
YOU KNOW?

10:55.789 --> 11:00.227
EVERYBODY LEFT AND...

11:00.327 --> 11:03.697
I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
AND SAID GOODBYE TO THEM...

11:04.965 --> 11:07.667
GOT A COFFEE AND I CAME BACK
AND HE WAS...

11:07.768 --> 11:10.403
HE WAS ASLEEP.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.973
HE, UH...

11:13.073 --> 11:15.642
WELL, HE HAD A PULSE ANYWAY.

11:15.743 --> 11:20.380
AND I SAT DOWN AND I STARTED
TALKING TO HIM.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.249
AND...

11:26.253 --> 11:30.991
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE
A PULSE ANYMORE.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.793
( sighs )

11:32.893 --> 11:37.464
- YOU WERE TALKING
TO HIM WHEN HE DIED?
- I WAS TALKING AT HIM, GINA.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.567
I SAID...

11:40.667 --> 11:45.105
I'M SORRY AND--

11:47.374 --> 11:50.277
I SAID I WAS SORRY THAT
I HADN'T SEEN MORE OF HIM.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.149
I ASKED HIM IF I COULD
GET HIM ANYTHING

11:56.249 --> 11:58.752
AND...

12:00.453 --> 12:03.323
THEN I JUST STARTED
COMPLAINING ABOUT MY LIFE...

12:04.224 --> 12:06.293
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.365
I LOOKED UP AND HE WAS...

12:15.903 --> 12:18.338
HE WAS GONE.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.843
DID IT FEEL TO YOU
LIKE HE'D BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU TO COME BACK

12:22.943 --> 12:25.212
TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE DIED?

12:25.312 --> 12:28.048
NO. THAT'S WHAT
THE NURSES SAY, BUT--

12:28.148 --> 12:30.417
THEY SAY THAT THAT HAPPENS
A LOT, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.086
- I THINK IT'S CRAZY.
- NO, NOT REALLY.

12:33.186 --> 12:37.090
ON SOME UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL
HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
IT WAS YOU.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.859
OR SENSED IT.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.229
NO.
NO, HE DIDN'T.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.165
DIDN'T YOU EVER BECOME
SUDDENLY AWARE

12:45.265 --> 12:48.101
OF YOUR CHILDREN
WITHOUT THEM HAVING
SAID ANYTHING?

12:48.201 --> 12:51.604
WITH MAX, I REMEMBER
WHEN HE USED TO WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

12:51.704 --> 12:54.407
AND HE WOULD COME IN TO MY ROOM
AND I WOULD JUST WAKE UP.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.144
AND THERE HE WOULD BE
STANDING AT THE END OF THE BED,

12:57.244 --> 13:00.347
JUST STARING SILENTLY AT ME.
YEAH.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.216
SO EVEN THOUGH MAX
HADN'T SAID A THING,

13:03.316 --> 13:04.651
YOU WOKE UP.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.253
YEAH, GREAT.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.355
SO MY FATHER BECOMES AWARE
OF ME ON SOME LEVEL

13:08.455 --> 13:11.724
AND HE REALLY DOESN'T WANT
TO LISTEN TO ME COMPLAIN
SO HE JUST DIES.

13:11.825 --> 13:16.096
- HMPH.
- OR HE BECOMES AWARE
OF YOU ON SOME LEVEL,

13:16.196 --> 13:19.499
AND HE'S FINALLY ABLE
TO LET GO.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.572
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE
YOUR VERSION.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.407
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.177
OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING IT
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

13:30.277 --> 13:34.447
DO I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S
SOME NON-SCIENTIFIC CONNECTION

13:34.547 --> 13:36.749
BETWEEN A PARENT AND CHILD?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.618
ABSOLUTELY.

13:38.718 --> 13:42.923
DOES THAT MEAN THAT A PARENT
KNOWS WHAT A CHILD NEEDS?

13:43.023 --> 13:46.126
NO, IT JUST MEANS
THERE'S A CONNECTION.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.595
NO, WE'RE MORE THAN
CONNECTED.

13:48.695 --> 13:52.399
THERE'S OBLIGATIONS
BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN.

13:52.499 --> 13:56.303
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
THEY OWE US AND THERE ARE
THINGS THAT WE OWE THEM.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.838
YES, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I THINK OBLIGATION

13:58.939 --> 14:01.174
IS MAYBE A SUBJECT
FOR ANOTHER DAY, PAUL.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.911
NO, I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT OBLIGATION TODAY.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.347
MY FATHER
OWED ME THINGS...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.952
AND HE DIDN'T
COME THROUGH FOR ME.
AND I OWED HIM THINGS

14:12.052 --> 14:13.987
AND I DIDN'T
COME THROUGH FOR HIM.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.556
IF I'M NOT GOING TO DO
ANY BETTER BY MY KIDS

14:16.656 --> 14:19.392
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO COME AND SEE ME TILL
I'M ABOUT TO DIE,

14:19.492 --> 14:22.963
THEN WE ARE ALL
HOPELESSLY SCREWED.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.268
IS THAT YOUR FATHER'S WATCH?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.837
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?
- NO.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.173
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING IN GENERAL.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.709
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
OBLIGATIONS OR FAMILY DUTY.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.179
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR FATHER.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.481
YEAH.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.019
THIS IS HIS WATCH.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.988
I'M GONNA WEAR IT
FOR A BIT.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.257
I DON'T USUALLY
WEAR WATCHES.

14:52.759 --> 14:55.128
BUT I'LL WEAR THIS
FOR A WHILE.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.933
BECAUSE IT'S
A PATHETIC EXCUSE

15:00.033 --> 15:03.103
FOR GRIEVING.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.438
THERE IT IS.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.874
WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU SAID THE ONLY PERSON

15:07.975 --> 15:10.143
YOU LEARNED ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT DAY WAS YOU?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.845
I FELT LIKE I WAS
IN A MOVIE I WAS
WATCHING.

15:12.946 --> 15:16.516
SELF-CENTERED GUY GOES
TO THE HOSPITAL TO SEE
HIS DYING FATHER,

15:16.616 --> 15:20.087
SITS DOWN, CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING TO SAY
TO HIS DAD.

15:20.187 --> 15:24.191
THEN HE STARTS WHINING
ABOUT HIS OWN LITTLE PROBLEMS.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.961
A DIVORCE, THE FEAR OF LOSING
TOUCH WITH HIS CHILDREN,

15:28.061 --> 15:30.530
A MOVE TO A NEW CITY,

15:30.630 --> 15:32.732
THE THREAT TO THE MAN'S WORK
FROM A LAWSUIT.

15:32.832 --> 15:36.303
THEY DON'T SOUND SO LITTLE
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SAY THEM.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.639
THESE ARE BIG PROBLEMS
TO SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE
OF THEIR LIFE.

15:39.739 --> 15:43.210
BUT TO SOMEONE
CONFRONTING DEATH,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.578
LIKE THE FATHER,
IT MIGHT SEEM

15:45.678 --> 15:48.848
THAT THE SON COULD WORK
THESE PROBLEMS OUT.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.418
THE DYING FATHER
DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME

15:51.518 --> 15:52.919
BUT THE SON DOES.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.188
NO MARRIAGE,
NO CHILDREN,

15:55.288 --> 15:58.625
NO PRACTICE, JUST TIME.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.661
WITHOUT THE TIME,
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
OF THE OTHER THINGS.

16:01.761 --> 16:06.033
- I GUESS.
- NO, IT'S NOT A GUESS.
IT'S TRUE.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.768
TIME'S THE PRECIOUS THING.
YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

16:08.868 --> 16:12.605
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
WEARING HIS WATCH.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.807
MAYBE YOU WERE
TELLING HIM YOUR
PROBLEMS BECAUSE

16:14.907 --> 16:18.911
YOU WERE HOPING
HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
MEANINGFUL TO YOU.

16:19.012 --> 16:22.649
- OR FINALLY BE A FATHER TO YOU.
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.618
BUT AFTER HE WAS GONE
I WISHED

16:25.718 --> 16:28.555
THE WHINING GUY
IN THE MOVIE

16:28.655 --> 16:32.325
COULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIND
OF COMFORT TO HIS FATHER.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.495
I WISHED I HAD

16:35.595 --> 16:39.166
DONE OR SAID SOMETHING
MORE THAN JUST TAKE
THE MAN'S WATCH.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.639
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISHED
YOU HAD ASKED HIM

16:46.739 --> 16:48.241
BEFORE HE WAS GONE?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.710
I WANTED TO ASK HIM IF--

16:50.810 --> 16:52.479
IF HE WAS PROUD OF ME.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.814
- BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS.
- DO I?

16:54.914 --> 16:56.816
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR
TO YOUR PATIENTS.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.018
YOU'RE A GOOD
FATHER TO YOUR CHILDREN.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.292
- AND YOU LOVE SINGING.
- ( chuckles )

17:05.392 --> 17:08.328
I'M A TERRIBLE SINGER, GINA.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.397
I DIDN'T SAY YOU
WERE A GOOD SINGER.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.233
- ( laughs )
- I SAID YOU LIKED SINGING.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.374
I SHOULD HAVE GONE EARLIER.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.643
I KNOW THAT.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.613
GUESS I WAS AFRAID.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.185
ONCE I WAS THERE, I THOUGHT,
"WHAT THE HELL WAS I AFRAID OF?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.422
MY FATHER IS DYING.
WHAT CAN HE POSSIBLY DO TO ME?"

17:37.357 --> 17:39.592
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU WERE AFRAID OF?

17:39.692 --> 17:42.729
I WAS AFRAID THAT AFTER
A LIFETIME OF HATING HIM...

17:44.997 --> 17:47.567
HE WAS GONNA LOVE ME ANYWAY.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.138
AND I THINK I--

17:51.238 --> 17:53.506
I WAITED TILL HE
COULDN'T TALK ANYMORE

17:53.606 --> 17:57.777
BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO HEAR HIM SAY IT.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.080
WHY WOULD THAT
HAVE BEEN SO BAD?

18:01.181 --> 18:05.585
BECAUSE IF HE COULD LOVE ME
AND NOT GIVE ME ONE MINUTE
OF HIS TIME...

18:07.587 --> 18:11.191
THEN LOVE DOESN'T MEAN A THING
AND I DON'T WANT IT.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.262
YOU CAN'T
INTELLECTUALIZE IT.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.898
IT'S SOMETHING WE FEEL--
SOMETIMES WITH GOOD REASON,

18:18.998 --> 18:20.333
SOMETIMES NOT.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.435
MMM.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.106
YOU KNOW, I WAS A PALLBEARER

18:27.207 --> 18:30.843
AND SO WAS IAN.

18:32.379 --> 18:35.215
AND AS WE CAME OUT
OF THE CHURCH

18:35.315 --> 18:37.417
AND CARRIED THE COFFIN
TO THE CHURCHYARD,

18:37.517 --> 18:40.220
I LOOKED OVER AT HIM
AND I THOUGHT,

18:40.320 --> 18:45.458
"ONE DAY HE'S
GONNA CARRY ME...

18:45.558 --> 18:48.161
IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
NOT TO MESS IT UP."

18:49.296 --> 18:50.897
YOU WON'T MESS IT UP.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.732
HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE?

18:52.832 --> 18:54.867
BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW

18:54.967 --> 18:59.606
THAT LOVE IS THE ONLY
THING THAT HAS A CHANCE
AGAINST DEATH.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.942
IT CAUSES US A LOT OF PAIN,
BUT WITHOUT IT, WE FEEL

19:03.042 --> 19:06.646
ISOLATED, UNTETHERED,
LOST IN SPACE.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.684
SO...

19:11.784 --> 19:14.521
MY FATHER

19:14.621 --> 19:17.190
LOVED ME.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.993
AND HE DID
WHAT HE COULD.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.162
NO.
YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU

19:23.263 --> 19:25.698
AND HE DID WHAT HE DID.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.903
AND YOU LOVED HIM
AND YOU HATED HIM
BECAUSE HE IGNORED YOU.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.175
WOW.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.612
IT'S NOT PRETTY.
IS IT?

19:39.712 --> 19:42.449
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE HAD
THE FATHER YOU DESERVED.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.486
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN BE
A FATHER TO YOURSELF NOW

19:46.586 --> 19:49.188
AND DO FOR YOURSELF
WHAT YOU DO FOR YOUR BOYS.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.330
DID YOU HAVE THE FATHER
THAT YOU NEEDED?

20:04.471 --> 20:08.308
( snickers )
I'M A THERAPIST--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.548
UH, I GOTTA GO.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.884
I'VE GOT TO MEET

20:17.984 --> 20:20.520
- ALEX'S FATHER.
- ( sighs )

20:20.620 --> 20:23.590
MAYBE THERE'S
SOME WAY I CAN HELP.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.297
THANK YOU, GINA.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.360
( sighs ) SORRY--
SORRY I'M LATE.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.296
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO SEE
YOU AT ALL, SO WE'RE EVEN.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.132
WELL, I WOULDN'T THINK
THAT MAKES US EVEN.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.735
NEITHER DO I.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.739
OH, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU HAVING COFFEE?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.974
WITH YOU?
( snorts )

21:15.074 --> 21:17.209
NO, NO COFFEE.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.245
CAN YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE?

21:19.346 --> 21:22.549
I'M ONLY MEETING YOU HERE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO STAND
WHEN I TALKED TO YOU.

21:22.649 --> 21:26.586
- YOU COULD HAVE CALLED.
- AND I DIDN'T COME HERE
FOR YOU TO BE CUTE.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.422
SO JUST SHUT UP AND LISTEN,

21:29.522 --> 21:31.658
THEN I'LL GO
AND THIS'LL BE OVER.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.694
I LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE.
I READ THE DOCUMENTS.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.665
MY LAWYER TELLS ME
IT COULD TAKE TWO YEARS

21:38.765 --> 21:41.468
WATCHING YOU FIGHT THIS
AND TRY TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.236
WHY SHOULD I DO THAT--
WASTE TWO YEARS

21:44.337 --> 21:46.706
FIGHTING WITH YOU, HUH?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.509
NO.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.413
I'M GONNA DROP THE CASE.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.918
- YOU'RE GONNA
DROP THE CASE?
- YEAH.

21:59.018 --> 22:03.356
I'LL TAKE THE SETTLEMENT MONEY
THAT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY
IS OFFERING.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.225
I'LL DROP THE CASE.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.396
- PROVIDING...
- PROVIDING WHAT?

22:09.496 --> 22:14.501
YOU WRITE A LETTER OF APOLOGY
ACCEPTING FULL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DEATH OF MY SON.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.936
( groans )
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
WITH A LETTER LIKE THAT?

22:17.036 --> 22:19.839
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- IF IT MEANS THAT YOU
CAN USE IT

22:19.939 --> 22:22.675
TO KEEP ME
FROM PRACTICING, I THINK
IT IS MY BUSINESS, YEAH.

22:22.775 --> 22:27.179
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT OTHER LIVES
YOU DESTROY.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.817
BUT I NEED SOMETHING--
PROOF--

22:30.917 --> 22:35.788
A PIECE OF PAPER THAT TELLS ME
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

22:35.888 --> 22:39.225
SO YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE A LETTER.

22:39.325 --> 22:42.895
FROM YOU, ACCEPTING
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

22:44.431 --> 22:47.534
YOU TOOK AWAY MY SON'S
ABILITY TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
FROM HIS JOB,

22:47.634 --> 22:51.103
AND THUS DESTROYED
HIS ABILITY TO DO IT.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.340
YOU KILLED HIM.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.777
THAT'S ALL I WANT.
IT'S JUST FOR ME.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.379
I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW IT
TO ANYBODY ELSE.
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.315
YOU WON'T INSTITUTE
A MALPRACTICE PROCEEDING?

23:03.416 --> 23:05.618
I CAN'T GET A PICTURE
OUT OF MY HEAD

23:05.718 --> 23:08.521
OF MY SON IN YOUR OFFICE.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.759
I NEED SOMETHING...

23:12.859 --> 23:15.327
THAT LETS ME KNOW

23:15.428 --> 23:18.565
THAT YOU KNOW YOU GOT BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.570
THEN YOU'LL NEVER HEAR
FROM ME AGAIN.

23:23.670 --> 23:26.138
- YOU KNOW--
- YOU TALK TO YOUR LAWYERS

23:26.238 --> 23:28.575
AND YOU LET THEM KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.926
( eerie music playing )
