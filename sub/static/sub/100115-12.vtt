WEBVTT

00:00.651 --> 00:01.851
"Honor."

00:02.056 --> 00:04.743
It's a word that gets thrown
around a lot at Stonewall Prep.

00:04.891 --> 00:06.154
Mr. Weston Wallis,

00:06.242 --> 00:08.841
you have been challenged
to a duel by Mr. Jones,

00:08.929 --> 00:12.445
who has invoked arcane
Stonewall Prep tradition.

00:12.717 --> 00:14.078
Do you accept?

00:15.294 --> 00:16.600
That'd be a yes.

00:16.937 --> 00:17.993
Very good.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.124
What about fencing?

00:19.211 --> 00:20.810
Oh, can we just
bare-knuckle brawl?

00:20.898 --> 00:23.742
May I suggest
that you do both.

00:24.061 --> 00:25.738
And in case
of a tie-breaker...

00:25.826 --> 00:27.333
A battle of intellect.

00:27.421 --> 00:29.242
A chess match.

00:29.352 --> 00:30.695
Excellent.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.007
Then it is settled.

00:34.052 --> 00:36.170
You may both
now choose a second

00:36.258 --> 00:38.130
for moral
and tactical support.

00:38.373 --> 00:39.757
I pick Jonathan.

00:41.407 --> 00:42.742
I'll choose Donna.

00:42.926 --> 00:44.921
And may the best man win.

00:48.036 --> 00:51.531
I'm assuming you've never
held a saber before.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.349
Lucky for you,
I'm an excellent coach,

00:54.437 --> 00:57.726
and Bret is decidedly
mediocre with a sword.

01:01.293 --> 01:03.556
Hey, by the way,
I meant to ask you,

01:03.690 --> 01:05.562
when does your mom
get back?

01:05.649 --> 01:07.085
She's wrapping up a case.

01:07.172 --> 01:09.522
- Couple more days, she says.
- Got you.

01:12.941 --> 01:14.050
Hey, can we help you?

01:17.032 --> 01:18.279
Holy hell.

01:20.365 --> 01:21.534
Ted Bishop.

01:21.621 --> 01:22.840
How are you, Frank?

01:26.235 --> 01:27.411
Hey.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.064
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:30.152 --> 01:31.365
It's, uh...

01:31.762 --> 01:33.443
It's bad news.

01:33.894 --> 01:37.146
I'm making the rounds.
I wanted to tell you guys in person.

01:37.579 --> 01:38.997
Greg died.

01:40.117 --> 01:41.570
Yeah, he had cancer.

01:42.234 --> 01:43.881
Rotted his guts.

01:44.948 --> 01:46.118
After everything else...

01:46.206 --> 01:47.206
Hmm.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.039
I'm sorry. Uh...

01:49.127 --> 01:50.781
Archie, this is Ted Bishop.
We served together.

01:50.868 --> 01:52.433
Ted, this is
my nephew, Archie.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.581
- Oh.
- Hey.

01:53.669 --> 01:55.742
Fred's kid.
Nice to meet you.

01:55.830 --> 01:56.958
Same.

01:57.046 --> 01:58.745
We were just
calling it quits for the day,

01:58.832 --> 02:00.349
if you wanna join us
for dinner.

02:01.487 --> 02:04.318
Yeah. How about it, Ted?

02:04.584 --> 02:05.904
Yeah, all right.

02:11.627 --> 02:12.896
FYI,

02:12.984 --> 02:15.737
Smithers and I are road-tripping
to New York tomorrow.

02:15.825 --> 02:17.357
Oh? What's the occasion?

02:17.460 --> 02:20.302
I have an interview at Barnard
College, if you must know.

02:20.463 --> 02:22.943
And, of course, I'll be going
on a shopping spree beforehand

02:23.030 --> 02:24.505
to find the right outfit
to impress.

02:24.593 --> 02:26.469
Well, that's perfect timing.
Your mother and I were just planning

02:26.556 --> 02:27.990
our own trip to New York.

02:30.090 --> 02:31.483
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

02:31.571 --> 02:33.661
I have a few business meetings
I've been putting off.

02:33.749 --> 02:36.740
And I'm having lunch with the
girls at Cafe des Creatifs.

02:36.828 --> 02:38.200
And don't worry, mija,

02:38.288 --> 02:41.052
as soon as we reach Manhattan,
we'll go our separate ways.

02:41.484 --> 02:42.818
Fine.

02:43.007 --> 02:45.825
But New York is my town.

02:46.489 --> 02:47.810
Not yours.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:57.195 --> 03:00.107
Fangs, tell me you're not
selling drugs again.

03:00.851 --> 03:02.287
Toni,

03:02.374 --> 03:05.654
so Kevin and I
started this little...

03:06.552 --> 03:07.771
side hustle.

03:07.858 --> 03:11.340
Don't worry.
It's nothing illegal, per se.

03:11.427 --> 03:13.429
What kind of side hustle?

03:13.516 --> 03:16.443
It looks lucrative as hell.
Is this...

03:16.823 --> 03:18.724
something I can get in on?

03:24.911 --> 03:26.622
The nerve of that man!

03:26.710 --> 03:27.895
Who does he think he is?

03:27.983 --> 03:30.011
What happened, Mom?
What did Mr. Honey say?

03:30.099 --> 03:33.275
Your principal refuses
to believe that I acted alone.

03:33.362 --> 03:35.103
That's typical.

03:35.190 --> 03:36.626
What's the punishment?

03:36.713 --> 03:39.629
Well, honey,
you're suspended for a week

03:39.716 --> 03:43.937
and stripped of your editor-in-chief
duties at the Blue and Gold.

03:44.024 --> 03:47.115
- Oh, my God.
- And barred from attending senior prom

03:47.202 --> 03:50.074
for some ungodly reason.

03:50.161 --> 03:53.556
Oh, and that
Bret Weston Wallis character,

03:53.643 --> 03:55.775
he's filing a restraining order
against you,

03:55.862 --> 03:57.734
claiming that
he "fears for his life."

03:57.821 --> 04:00.241
What, Bret is afraid of me?
Why?

04:00.749 --> 04:03.479
Apparently, you cracked
open his head with a golf club.

04:03.566 --> 04:05.185
Oh, right. I did do that.

04:12.183 --> 04:13.445
What's this?

04:13.532 --> 04:15.357
My latest murder board.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.208
Who got murdered?

04:17.493 --> 04:19.833
Mr. Chipping. Maybe.

04:21.017 --> 04:23.232
We let the case get cold.

04:23.455 --> 04:26.122
But we know
Bret's a total sociopath.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.990
So let's find out
if he's a killer too.

04:38.427 --> 04:41.299
So there was an ambush
near the city center.

04:41.386 --> 04:43.867
And they sent us in
to extract any wounded.

04:43.954 --> 04:47.262
I end up walking down
a blind alley.

04:47.349 --> 04:50.911
I get hit in both legs,
and I go down.

04:51.309 --> 04:52.943
But he got me out of there.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.779
It wasn't till we got back to
the aid station I saw that Frank,

04:59.230 --> 05:01.490
he'd been hit
four times himself.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.341
But, hey,

05:04.583 --> 05:07.591
you got a Red Badge of Courage
for saving my ass, right?

05:08.021 --> 05:09.786
I got lucky. That's all.

05:09.949 --> 05:11.294
Hmm.

05:11.982 --> 05:13.418
Well, boys, uh,

05:13.505 --> 05:15.812
I appreciate the warm meal
and hospitality,

05:15.899 --> 05:17.091
but it's time I ship out.

05:17.179 --> 05:19.747
You could stay here,
if you want, Mr. Bishop.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.297
My mom's out of town.
There's plenty of room.

05:22.384 --> 05:24.386
Well, so long as I'm not
putting anyone out.

05:24.473 --> 05:25.990
No, you're not.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.001
My, what a tangled web.

05:31.088 --> 05:34.107
And you think this Bret
character is behind it all?

05:35.440 --> 05:37.943
He's definitely
the leader of the pack.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.924
Okay. Well, where do we begin?

05:41.011 --> 05:45.972
We have missing students, evil preppies,
dead writers, a teacher's suicide.

05:46.059 --> 05:49.759
Apparent suicide.
Chipping didn't leave a note.

05:49.846 --> 05:52.414
And even though
Jughead's classmate Donna

05:52.509 --> 05:55.740
has painted a very
incriminating portrait of him,

05:56.834 --> 05:59.071
I don't think
she's telling the truth.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.867
Well, then that's
where we start.

06:01.553 --> 06:03.181
Tell me, Elizabeth,

06:03.295 --> 06:05.177
is there a Mrs. Chipping?

06:11.868 --> 06:13.409
Hey, where's the fire?

06:13.609 --> 06:15.498
Sorry. I'm gonna
be late for school.

06:15.698 --> 06:17.829
Ted, don't be a stranger.
Hope to see you again soon.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.178
Yeah, same here.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.373
See you.

06:21.607 --> 06:23.272
He's a good kid.

06:23.532 --> 06:24.750
He is.

06:24.837 --> 06:26.678
He's just like his father was.

06:26.826 --> 06:28.566
All right, listen,
why don't you finish up,

06:28.654 --> 06:30.223
and then I'll drive you
to the bus station.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.529
Sounds good.

06:39.591 --> 06:41.365
- Hello?
<i>- Frank, it's June.</i>

06:41.453 --> 06:42.982
- June?
- <i>Listen, I don't have...</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.318
Whoa, slow down.
Slow down.

06:44.406 --> 06:45.818
- W-W-Wait.
- <i>Duckie was murdered.</i>

06:45.906 --> 06:47.539
- What happened to Duckie?
- He said something about...

06:49.690 --> 06:51.645
I don't understand.
How can he be dead too?

06:51.733 --> 06:52.834
That doesn't make any...

07:15.989 --> 07:17.716
What the hell's going on?

07:28.402 --> 07:30.005
I forgot my phone.

07:30.092 --> 07:31.473
<font color=#FF00FF>*RIVERDALE *</font>

Episode Title:
<font color=#FFc30f>" Chapter Sixty-Nine: Men of Honor"</font>

07:35.549 --> 07:38.658
I'm sorry, Archie. I usually have
an instinct about these things.

07:38.824 --> 07:41.533
Uncle Frank, why the hell is one
of your friends trying to kill you?

07:41.621 --> 07:44.416
After the war,
I was hard up.

07:44.766 --> 07:47.876
Ted reached out,
and he told me about this security gig.

07:47.964 --> 07:50.814
It paid well, hired vets,
no questions asked.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.689
The thing is,
it was a private paramilitary contract,

07:53.777 --> 07:55.572
and they sent us
all over the world...

07:56.614 --> 07:58.104
as mercenaries.

07:58.613 --> 08:00.371
Okay, so why come after you?

08:00.610 --> 08:03.892
My guess is the company's
tying up loose ends.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.865
Maybe they're about to be exposed.
Ted's still on their payroll.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.783
So get ahead of this.

08:08.973 --> 08:11.488
You come forward and blow the
lid off these mercenaries.

08:12.432 --> 08:14.401
It's not that easy, Archie.

08:14.743 --> 08:16.095
I was a part of it.

08:16.183 --> 08:17.629
I did things. I...

08:18.176 --> 08:19.360
followed orders.

08:19.580 --> 08:21.252
All right. Then we need to
get you out of town.

08:21.339 --> 08:22.423
- No.

08:22.785 --> 08:24.048
It's too dangerous.

08:24.136 --> 08:28.224
Anybody he comes into contact
with in this town is at risk now.

08:28.312 --> 08:30.313
And he's not gonna leave
until I'm dead.

08:30.401 --> 08:32.006
So, in that case,
we need backup.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.187
No way.

08:33.274 --> 08:35.155
No, Uncle Frank, trust me.

08:35.405 --> 08:36.808
This guy can help.

08:37.929 --> 08:40.515
Thank you for coming
to see us, Mrs. Chipping.

08:40.716 --> 08:43.475
We can't even imagine
how hard this has been for you.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.391
And we promise,
we're just here to help.

08:46.591 --> 08:48.915
The first question
is the hardest.

08:49.115 --> 08:51.266
The answer is "no."

08:51.466 --> 08:56.488
I absolutely do not believe my husband
was having an affair with that student.

08:56.688 --> 09:00.840
And, Rupert, he had his problems,
but he never cheated on me.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.303
Not ever.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.148
What kind of problems?

09:04.348 --> 09:06.063
Drinking more than usual,

09:06.263 --> 09:08.500
complaining about
the Baxter Brothersbooks.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.460
Wishing he'd never
gotten the contract.

09:11.660 --> 09:15.179
Wasn't he proud to be
a Baxter Brotherswriter?

09:15.267 --> 09:16.769
In the beginning.

09:16.969 --> 09:20.439
But then, as the years
went on, he, um,

09:21.670 --> 09:24.299
felt like he had an albatross
around his neck.

09:24.499 --> 09:27.345
But hadn't he just finished
his last book?

09:27.545 --> 09:29.243
Why...

09:29.330 --> 09:32.728
kill himself if he was
so close to being done?

09:34.422 --> 09:35.737
I don't know.

09:36.927 --> 09:38.729
I just... I don't know.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.013
And I, um...

09:43.213 --> 09:45.083
I brought a box
of his personal effects

09:45.171 --> 09:47.184
from when I cleaned out
his office.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.456
I can't make sense
of any of it.

09:51.656 --> 09:53.893
But maybe you can.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.541
We'll try, Mrs. Chipping.

09:57.534 --> 09:59.447
What does any of this mean?

10:02.580 --> 10:05.376
Why does Mr. Chipping
have army pamphlets?

10:06.367 --> 10:07.752
Unless...

10:10.458 --> 10:12.521
Wait a minute.

10:12.721 --> 10:15.698
So a highly trained mercenary tried
to kill you two in the kitchen,

10:15.898 --> 10:18.440
and now he's in hiding,
waiting to strike again?

10:18.640 --> 10:21.660
- Is that about right?
- I'm his target, not Archie.

10:21.865 --> 10:23.828
I don't want anyone paying
for my mistakes but me.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.274
I know what it's like
when the past comes knocking.

10:26.474 --> 10:27.947
As a vet

10:28.035 --> 10:30.369
and as a Serpent, I've been
in a couple of barfights

10:30.456 --> 10:31.652
with these ultramarine types.

10:31.740 --> 10:34.107
They're tough bastards,
but...

10:34.307 --> 10:35.979
..I've held my own
against them.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.905
Can you lure him out,
Uncle Frank?

10:39.661 --> 10:42.216
It would have to be somewhere
under our complete control.

10:43.316 --> 10:45.068
We got that. The gym.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.023
All right.

10:49.975 --> 10:51.236
All right. I'll get him there.

10:51.324 --> 10:53.083
Your weapons,
gentlemen.

10:53.283 --> 10:56.035
First to three points wins.

10:56.373 --> 10:57.611
Now,

10:58.938 --> 11:00.275
en garde.

11:03.728 --> 11:05.259
And begin.

11:08.733 --> 11:11.536
- - A hit on
Mr. Jones. Point to Weston Wallis.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.032
Begin.

11:22.007 --> 11:23.878
Point to Mr. Jones.
One to one.

11:23.966 --> 11:25.271
And begin.

11:28.840 --> 11:32.295
A hit on Mr. Jones.
Point to Weston Wallis. Two to one.

11:32.383 --> 11:33.384
Begin.

11:41.897 --> 11:43.031
No.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.613
The match is over.

11:44.813 --> 11:47.478
Weston Wallis is our victor.

12:03.059 --> 12:06.841
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Katy Keene.

12:07.096 --> 12:08.941
- Hi. Oh!
- It's so good to see you.

12:09.141 --> 12:10.748
It has been way too long, girl.

12:11.076 --> 12:13.512
I know something that
is gonna make you even happier.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.979
I hear that the new Proenza Schouler
collection on the fourth floor

12:16.066 --> 12:17.299
is to die for.

12:17.387 --> 12:20.283
I can't wait. I need to ooze collegiate
cuteness at this interview tomorrow.

12:20.370 --> 12:23.471
Well, I have already scoped out
some Barnard-ready options.

12:23.559 --> 12:25.809
Well, good thing I'm armed
with my mother's Lacy's card.

12:25.897 --> 12:29.440
If that's the case,
I know exactly where to start. Come on.

13:08.024 --> 13:11.098
Oh, I don't want this
"Rainbow High" montage to end.

13:11.186 --> 13:14.608
Who says it has to? We can leave our
bags with Smithers and just keep going.

13:14.696 --> 13:16.444
Wait. Do you like drag?

13:16.532 --> 13:20.249
My friend Jorge and I always sneak into
this little dive bar called Molly's Crisis.

13:20.561 --> 13:21.876
Sounds amazing.

13:31.397 --> 13:32.800
I'm unarmed.

13:33.269 --> 13:34.549
I keep my word.

13:34.749 --> 13:36.141
Good.

13:36.228 --> 13:38.553
We don't want
any unnecessary bloodshed.

13:38.753 --> 13:41.618
But just so you know, Ted,
the same way you came after me,

13:41.706 --> 13:43.278
they're gonna send someone
after you.

13:43.366 --> 13:44.366
Probably.

13:45.673 --> 13:47.990
But I don't get paid
to think like that.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.743
I get paid

13:51.156 --> 13:52.711
to follow orders.

13:53.724 --> 13:56.658
I'm sorry it's gotta end
like this, buddy.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
But...

13:59.338 --> 14:01.307
I'll make it painless.

14:02.820 --> 14:05.094
And none of your loved ones
will be harmed.

14:05.606 --> 14:07.226
- I swear.
- Ted,

14:07.869 --> 14:09.446
I'm sorry too, brother.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.811
You broke the code, Frank.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.030
You can't break something that's
already been shattered to bits, Ted.

14:23.118 --> 14:25.320
And you're the one
coming after me.

14:25.408 --> 14:28.219
- On the ground. Hands up!
- You broke the code, Frank.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.610
All bets are off now.

14:31.675 --> 14:33.383
You're all fair game.

14:39.595 --> 14:41.354
Get some sleep.

14:41.554 --> 14:44.132
At 0800, you got a date
with the Feds.

14:45.079 --> 14:46.080
Hmm.

14:47.647 --> 14:49.877
What about Frank Andrews?

14:50.737 --> 14:52.662
He's a mercenary, too.

14:54.132 --> 14:55.133
Who?

14:56.569 --> 14:58.320
I don't know anyone
by that name.

15:16.161 --> 15:18.130
Welcome to the Maple Club.

15:19.113 --> 15:20.785
Now this is my kind of joint.

15:20.985 --> 15:22.308
I'm Antoinette.

15:22.508 --> 15:24.999
And what brings you to
our establishment this evening,

15:25.337 --> 15:26.642
Mr...

15:26.729 --> 15:28.514
St. Clair.

15:28.601 --> 15:31.273
I'm looking to throw a small
bash for myself and some pals

15:31.473 --> 15:33.711
to celebrate the fact that
we all got into Harvard.

15:33.911 --> 15:36.010
And a chum told me
about this place.

15:36.522 --> 15:38.019
And, from the looks of it,

15:38.219 --> 15:40.134
it seems like we'd have
a good time here.

15:40.526 --> 15:42.284
That, you would.

15:42.484 --> 15:47.108
How about I talk you through some of
Maple Club's offerings and options?

16:03.027 --> 16:05.525
Moose, who gave you
the army pamphlets?

16:05.725 --> 16:09.616
After the article airing,
all my dirty laundry was published,

16:09.816 --> 16:12.227
I mean, I was...
I was pretty messed up.

16:12.333 --> 16:13.388
Hmm.

16:13.476 --> 16:15.317
And Mr. Chipping suggested
I look into the military.

16:15.404 --> 16:17.831
I'm sorry, what's your
connection to Mr. Chipping?

16:17.919 --> 16:20.801
He recruited me.
To play football.

16:21.001 --> 16:23.630
Wait. Mr. Chipping's the reason
why you went to Stonewall Prep?

16:23.718 --> 16:24.724
Yeah.

16:24.827 --> 16:27.341
And what's weird is,
after the story about me came out,

16:27.519 --> 16:29.451
he was encouraging me to leave.

16:29.588 --> 16:32.154
Until Halloween night,
when it became more than a suggestion.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.357
I mean, he practically
shoved me out the door.

16:37.136 --> 16:38.484
Plus, um,

16:39.902 --> 16:41.399
there was a videotape.

16:41.615 --> 16:42.931
What videotape?

16:44.617 --> 16:50.381
Uh, Bret videotaped me having sex
in our dorm room with a classmate.

16:50.469 --> 16:54.102
He was lording it over me and
threatening to release it any minute.

16:54.342 --> 16:56.884
I'm sorry.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.864
Bret videotaped you
having sex in your dorm room?

17:00.174 --> 17:02.609
He said it would be a good
addition to his collection.

17:06.904 --> 17:10.925
Breaking and entering,
is this normal for you, Elizabeth?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.578
Kind of. But it's not really
breaking and entering, Mom.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.319
I mean, this is
Jughead's room, too.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.599
And he said I could come here
whenever I wanted, so...

17:17.688 --> 17:20.019
Like when all the preppy
scumbags are in class.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.803
Not quite all.

17:22.223 --> 17:24.241
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:24.329 --> 17:27.608
Looking for the dirt
that you have on Moose Mason.

17:27.733 --> 17:31.440
I know you filmed him
having sex to extort him.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.164
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.853
I have no idea what you
and, I'm assuming,

17:35.941 --> 17:38.883
your mother are referring
to, Ponytail.

17:39.305 --> 17:41.301
Does Moose have
this supposed sex tape?

17:41.389 --> 17:44.180
No, he says that you do,
in a collection.

17:44.508 --> 17:47.008
Where is it? Because it's
certainly not in this room.

17:47.096 --> 17:48.242
Question,

17:48.330 --> 17:51.224
did Mason ever lay eyes
on this alleged collection?

17:51.312 --> 17:52.522
Question,

17:53.291 --> 17:55.224
do you have a tape
of me and Jughead?

17:55.361 --> 17:56.898
Oh, my God!

17:56.986 --> 17:59.180
Mom, calm down.

17:59.906 --> 18:02.927
Moose said that
it was filmed in this room.

18:03.072 --> 18:04.734
Did you tape us, too?

18:05.797 --> 18:08.208
Again, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:08.345 --> 18:10.053
I don't have
any tapes like that.

18:14.171 --> 18:15.538
But if I did,

18:15.776 --> 18:18.680
it sure is a good thing
that I'm such a nice guy

18:18.943 --> 18:21.963
because I could really do a
number on you by releasing it.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.967
Leave now, and I won't tell Jones
about this latest escapade of yours,

18:26.055 --> 18:29.752
or you could come with me to Chemistry
class, and we could tell him together.

18:42.711 --> 18:47.936
So, assuming that you get into Barnard
next year, which you totally will,

18:48.296 --> 18:50.894
is Archie moving here
with you next year?

18:51.141 --> 18:53.813
That's still very much
up in the air.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.568
Honestly,

18:55.733 --> 18:57.884
I don't think Riverdale
could survive without him.

18:58.029 --> 18:59.700
Well, there's always
long distance.

18:59.788 --> 19:02.304
Totally, and that's what my best
friend Betty and her beau are doing,

19:02.391 --> 19:04.033
and they're
making it work, so...

19:04.264 --> 19:06.176
What about you
and your brawny boxer?

19:06.264 --> 19:07.761
- KO?
- Mmm-hmm.

19:07.954 --> 19:10.931
Well, we are a real thing now.

19:11.131 --> 19:12.926
I know. He's...

19:13.014 --> 19:14.282
He's the best.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.303
You know, I remember

19:16.615 --> 19:18.982
the first time
you held hands with him.

19:19.182 --> 19:21.333
It was at my quinceanera
at the Plaza.

19:21.533 --> 19:24.771
And you told me
his palms were sweaty

19:24.859 --> 19:26.319
because he was so nervous.

19:26.407 --> 19:28.215
Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.

19:28.303 --> 19:29.887
I can't believe
you remember that.

19:29.975 --> 19:32.754
- All I remember is that the Jonas
Brothers performed. - Mmm-hmm.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.545
And, of course,
how stunning you looked.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.175
Yeah, because you
and your mom made the dress.

19:37.375 --> 19:41.772
The dress that launched this
beautiful, unexpected relationship.

19:42.085 --> 19:44.740
How is your mother?
How is her shop?

19:47.061 --> 19:49.204
Veronica, my mom's really sick.

19:50.310 --> 19:53.192
And she's getting treatments,
and she's...

19:53.910 --> 19:56.140
Oh, she's being so strong.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.335
But, um...

19:59.636 --> 20:02.170
They... They caught it late,
so we're just...

20:02.905 --> 20:04.700
We're not sure
what's gonna happen.

20:06.992 --> 20:09.331
She's my best friend, Veronica.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.553
Katy.

20:11.975 --> 20:13.475
Ugh, I'm sorry.

20:15.456 --> 20:17.860
Didn't wanna tell you.
I didn't wanna cry today.

20:18.329 --> 20:20.305
Are you kidding me?

20:20.393 --> 20:23.624
What are old friends for if not
to provide shoulders to cry on?

20:24.770 --> 20:25.771
Come here.

20:28.052 --> 20:29.854
I love you, Katy Keene.

20:30.086 --> 20:32.490
You're gonna be okay,
I promise.

20:33.663 --> 20:35.022
Where are you gonna go?

20:35.110 --> 20:38.042
Head up to Canada. Maybe find
my way to Alaska, get some work.

20:38.130 --> 20:40.192
I just gotta get as far
off the radar as possible

20:40.280 --> 20:41.591
until this whole thing
blows over.

20:41.678 --> 20:43.178
If Ted can find me,
others can, too.

20:43.266 --> 20:45.865
Uncle Frank, can't you just talk
to the Feds, explain what happened?

20:45.952 --> 20:48.075
Maybe if you turn yourself in,
they'll go easy on you.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.880
Yeah, or maybe they make me the
scapegoat who goes down for all this.

20:50.967 --> 20:53.032
Those tend to be the breaks
I get in life, Archie.

20:53.249 --> 20:55.747
But if you go on the run now,
you'll never stop running.

20:56.409 --> 20:58.429
Man, you remind me so much
of your old man.

20:58.629 --> 21:00.151
You take care
of your mom, okay?

21:00.239 --> 21:01.646
Or I'll come back
and kick your ass.

21:01.734 --> 21:03.833
You can try.

21:08.813 --> 21:13.217
Babe, what happened to you today?
You ghosted me.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.419
Do you remember that
Patrick-Bateman-type from earlier today

21:16.507 --> 21:18.172
- at the Maple Club?
- Mmm.

21:18.388 --> 21:20.130
You mean, Nick St. Clair?

21:21.950 --> 21:23.944
Sophomore year,

21:24.959 --> 21:28.342
Nick came to Riverdale one
weekend looking for a party.

21:29.877 --> 21:30.878
He...

21:32.010 --> 21:34.022
spiked my champagne,

21:35.405 --> 21:37.102
and...

21:37.189 --> 21:40.600
coaxed me back to his room
at the Five Seasons,

21:41.237 --> 21:42.577
where...

21:43.326 --> 21:45.169
he attempted to assault me.

21:45.257 --> 21:47.565
- What?
- Thankfully,

21:47.765 --> 21:50.561
Veronica and Josie and the
Pussycats came to my rescue.

21:51.279 --> 21:53.117
I thought
I'd worked through it.

21:54.032 --> 21:55.561
Emotionally.

21:55.808 --> 21:57.208
But seeing him today, it...

21:57.374 --> 21:58.734
Triggered you.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.272
I get it.

22:03.749 --> 22:06.987
A similar experience happened to
me before I moved to Riverdale.

22:07.187 --> 22:08.647
Oh, TT.

22:09.064 --> 22:11.598
I'm so sorry.
What did you do?

22:12.143 --> 22:13.764
How did you cope?

22:14.803 --> 22:17.030
It took me a while, but,

22:17.118 --> 22:19.304
with a lot of help,
I worked through it.

22:22.262 --> 22:24.536
And, babe, I wanna
help you get there too.

22:28.593 --> 22:31.353
Gentlemen,
we'll go seven rounds.

22:31.441 --> 22:32.727
We're not gonna need rounds.

22:32.815 --> 22:34.642
No, all we'll need
is a coffin for Jones.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.818
Like the one I buried him in
way back when.

22:36.906 --> 22:39.819
Round one begins now.

22:47.743 --> 22:49.288
That's not bad, Bret.

22:54.489 --> 22:55.707
Oh.

22:55.794 --> 22:57.596
Well, he's got a glass jaw.

22:57.796 --> 22:59.337
Told you we weren't
gonna need rounds.

22:59.537 --> 23:01.495
Mr. Jones is the winner.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.192
The duel is officially tied.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.467
Tomorrow's chess match will
decide the ultimate winner.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.838
Oh, crap!

23:47.518 --> 23:49.922
A dead snake. Really?

23:50.521 --> 23:51.999
And body checks in the hall?

23:52.087 --> 23:53.953
Since when does Bret
even have so many friends?

23:54.041 --> 23:55.282
He doesn't.

23:55.372 --> 23:56.739
It's pack behavior.

23:56.827 --> 23:59.311
Bret's home-grown.
He's a Stonie through and through.

23:59.399 --> 24:01.114
Easy to root for.

24:01.408 --> 24:04.124
And, think about it,
if you win and Bret loses,

24:04.230 --> 24:07.686
if he's not a man of honor,
what does that say about them?

24:07.814 --> 24:09.800
So, what, this entire school
is against me now?

24:09.888 --> 24:12.205
Not the entire school, Jones.

24:13.115 --> 24:14.562
You still got me.

24:18.008 --> 24:19.287
If that tape exists...

24:19.375 --> 24:20.515
We have to find it.

24:20.603 --> 24:21.633
Agreed.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.648
But we can't search
the whole school.

24:23.736 --> 24:26.730
What if Bret stores
his collection

24:26.818 --> 24:29.534
in the room where they have
those secret society meetings?

24:29.622 --> 24:31.902
In Stonewall Prep's basement.

24:31.990 --> 24:33.049
Okay.

24:33.137 --> 24:35.608
But we didn't fare so well
breaking into their dorms.

24:35.696 --> 24:38.306
No, but Jughead still has
one last challenge.

24:38.394 --> 24:41.190
We can slip into the basement
while he's keeping Bret busy.

24:45.097 --> 24:46.532
Hey, Mr. Jones, what's up?

24:46.620 --> 24:48.422
Red, we got a problem.
Ted escaped.

24:48.510 --> 24:51.357
Wherever you are, you have to
get somewhere safe ASAP.

24:51.669 --> 24:53.209
What? How the hell
did he escape?

24:53.409 --> 24:54.863
He just about
snapped Tubby in two.

24:55.063 --> 24:56.945
Get yourself to safety, okay?

24:57.675 --> 24:59.267
Okay. Bye.

25:01.925 --> 25:02.926
Ted?

26:03.741 --> 26:05.611
What the hell is happening?

26:11.966 --> 26:13.750
This school is insane.

26:14.041 --> 26:15.094
Are you okay?

26:15.182 --> 26:16.322
Yeah.

27:02.103 --> 27:03.365
How...

27:03.452 --> 27:04.558
I thought you were gone.

27:04.646 --> 27:06.622
I had a gut feeling
this wasn't over, Archie.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.156
But it is now.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.877
Refill?

27:17.815 --> 27:19.704
You read my mind, sweetheart.

27:19.904 --> 27:23.918
Maybe you'd like to enjoy it
with me in a private room.

27:40.098 --> 27:41.675
You little minx.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.730
Relax,

27:43.841 --> 27:46.419
drink up, and, uh,

27:47.496 --> 27:49.813
I'm gonna get
a little more comfortable.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.270
Okay?

27:52.980 --> 27:55.215
You're gonna mop
the floor with him, Jug.

27:55.358 --> 27:57.137
Yeah, I hope so.

27:57.301 --> 28:01.347
I just have to stay focused if I'm gonna
wipe that smug smile off Bret's face.

28:02.201 --> 28:04.264
Where is the match?

28:04.352 --> 28:06.880
Uh, same place as all the other ones.
The seminar room.

28:06.968 --> 28:08.415
At what time?

28:09.663 --> 28:11.421
I wanna
raise the stakes.

28:11.597 --> 28:15.302
When I win, you walk away from
the Baxter Brotherscontract.

28:15.390 --> 28:16.543
To what end?

28:16.631 --> 28:19.684
The restoration of the rightful
natural order of the world.

28:19.862 --> 28:23.096
You lose, you slink away
and are never heard from again.

28:23.184 --> 28:25.160
Just like your grandfather.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.130
And Mr. DuPont
gives the contract to me.

28:28.218 --> 28:30.165
You wanna know what
the one problem with that is?

28:30.253 --> 28:31.341
Hmm?

28:33.194 --> 28:35.562
You're a terrible writer, Bret.

28:35.762 --> 28:40.081
So, no, I'm not going
to accept your terms.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.475
This is a duel about honor.

28:42.943 --> 28:44.484
And when you lose,

28:44.684 --> 28:46.131
it's going to be because

28:46.773 --> 28:48.133
I'm a better writer.

28:48.775 --> 28:50.483
I'm a better competitor.

28:51.865 --> 28:53.420
And I'm a better man.

28:55.564 --> 28:57.359
So can we get this
started already?

28:58.176 --> 28:59.177
Indeed.

29:01.135 --> 29:02.136
Gentlemen.

29:06.227 --> 29:07.630
Play wisely.

29:14.975 --> 29:17.490
Okay, come on.
Veronica said it was this way.

29:31.357 --> 29:33.601
All right, Betty.
You find the tapes, I'll stand watch.

29:33.689 --> 29:34.689
Okay.

30:32.345 --> 30:33.922
Oh, my God.

30:34.228 --> 30:37.894
Okay. Moose, Moose...

30:39.407 --> 30:40.810
Oh, that works, too.

30:53.465 --> 30:56.007
I'm sorry. Someone's broken
into the Quill and Skull's room.

30:56.207 --> 30:57.407
What are you talking about?

30:57.495 --> 30:59.913
Silent alarm. I have it synced
to alert me of any intruders.

31:00.001 --> 31:01.352
Mr. DuPont,
may I call a recess?

31:01.440 --> 31:05.165
Yes, of course. We'll resume
the game after this is cleared up.

31:08.658 --> 31:09.829
Betty.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.472
We have to go, now.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.648
Okay.

31:12.736 --> 31:13.737
All right.

31:26.019 --> 31:29.823
I almost admire your gumption, Ponytail,
but you're done. You're trespassing.

31:30.023 --> 31:32.652
And you're illegally recording
people having sex.

31:32.852 --> 31:34.861
And this is your tape
of me and Jughead.

31:34.949 --> 31:36.396
Whoa, whoa, wait.

31:37.185 --> 31:38.258
What the hell is going on?

31:38.346 --> 31:41.633
Your perv of a roommate
taped us in your bed, Jug.

31:42.862 --> 31:44.167
Are you serious, Bret?

31:44.255 --> 31:47.014
All the tapes in this room
are private property.

31:47.214 --> 31:51.627
Consensual testimonies given by students
being inducted into the Quill and Skull.

31:51.717 --> 31:55.368
The tape you're holding right now
is Jughead's initiation confession.

31:57.052 --> 31:58.543
Confession...

32:00.053 --> 32:01.507
I did make a confession.

32:01.707 --> 32:04.198
Right. So I'll have
my private property back.

32:08.322 --> 32:11.161
Excellent. Now,
can we finish the match?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.937
Wait. No, that allows me
to put you in...

32:40.137 --> 32:41.602
Checkmate, yeah.

32:42.459 --> 32:44.452
Why?
Why would you do that?

32:44.540 --> 32:46.814
'Cause I'm done
playing this game, Bret.

32:47.579 --> 32:49.076
That's game over, Mr. DuPont.

32:49.276 --> 32:51.027
Bret wins this duel.

32:51.115 --> 32:52.900
You

32:53.150 --> 32:56.598
are more of a Stonewall man
than I will ever be

32:57.491 --> 32:59.025
or I'll ever want to be.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.508
Let's blow this place.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.712
All right. Thank you,
Mr. Jones, I appreciate it.

33:15.189 --> 33:16.524
Okay. Bye.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.760
The Feds picked up Ted.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.372
He'll be tried for
everything he did in Riverdale.

33:25.572 --> 33:27.410
He said they're looking
for you, too.

33:27.791 --> 33:29.238
Of course, they are.

33:29.706 --> 33:31.595
My mom's the lawyer, not me,

33:31.795 --> 33:34.163
but wouldn't it go better
if you turned yourself in?

33:34.363 --> 33:36.462
You could cut a deal,
maybe, too.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.587
All right.

33:40.674 --> 33:43.215
All right, Archie, I'll do it.
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

33:43.415 --> 33:46.690
I genuinely think this is the
right thing to do, Uncle Frank.

33:50.161 --> 33:53.182
Veronica, your father
doesn't want me to tell you this,

33:53.382 --> 33:55.489
but I think it's important
that you know.

33:55.689 --> 33:57.788
We didn't go to New York
on business.

33:58.256 --> 33:59.928
We went to see a doctor.

34:00.128 --> 34:01.531
A specialist.

34:02.696 --> 34:04.628
He ran some tests,

34:04.828 --> 34:07.624
and he confirmed that
your father has a disease.

34:08.310 --> 34:09.503
What? What...

34:09.703 --> 34:11.679
What kind of disease?

34:11.879 --> 34:14.022
It's a neuromuscular disorder.

34:15.752 --> 34:17.503
It will weaken your father.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.072
His muscles will atrophy.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.945
He'll lose his motor skills.

34:24.369 --> 34:26.998
But there's good news.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.907
We caught it early,
so there's drugs

34:30.724 --> 34:32.735
- and therapies.
- So he's...

34:33.726 --> 34:35.172
going to be fine?

34:37.165 --> 34:38.568
I don't know.

34:39.862 --> 34:41.788
We just know that he's very...

34:42.735 --> 34:45.661
He's very sick.

34:47.349 --> 34:48.704
Mom.

34:56.402 --> 34:57.579
What?

34:57.736 --> 34:59.269
Where the hell am I?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.637
Who the hell are you?

35:03.725 --> 35:05.738
I bet you say that to all the boys.

35:05.825 --> 35:08.588
It's okay. Yeah.
We understand.

35:08.676 --> 35:10.687
Things got pretty wild
last night.

35:11.721 --> 35:13.036
You wanna see?

35:14.202 --> 35:17.346
You and the boys here
made a little video.

35:29.217 --> 35:30.714
Had enough?

35:30.914 --> 35:32.120
How could you?

35:32.208 --> 35:34.075
You can't...

35:34.395 --> 35:36.856
You better not show that to
anyone, you bitch, or I'm gonna...

35:36.982 --> 35:39.705
Or you'll what, exactly?

35:39.793 --> 35:41.769
Now listen up, worm,

35:41.969 --> 35:44.155
because I'm only
gonna say this once.

35:44.493 --> 35:46.027
You don't know me.

35:46.234 --> 35:48.166
But I know you.

35:48.366 --> 35:52.606
And I know exactly what you did
to my girlfriend Cheryl Blossom

35:52.806 --> 35:57.429
and what you've probably done to a
lot of other innocent young women.

35:58.463 --> 36:00.918
You will never step foot
in Riverdale again.

36:01.118 --> 36:05.444
You will not so much as even
think about Cheryl Blossom.

36:05.644 --> 36:09.144
And you will never assault
another woman

36:09.344 --> 36:15.708
because, if you do, I will let the
whole world see what was done to you.

36:16.499 --> 36:20.079
I will ruin you.

36:33.585 --> 36:35.474
Why are you tickling me?

36:39.200 --> 36:43.372
So... So Nick is what we in the tickle
business would call a first-class squealer.

36:46.381 --> 36:47.827
I propose a toast.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.534
To Toni Topaz,

36:51.734 --> 36:54.443
who slayed yet another dragon
from my past.

36:56.173 --> 36:58.099
Cheers!

37:04.486 --> 37:08.283
I am, as always,
one lucky lady.

37:29.864 --> 37:31.739
Frank didn't even
leave a note.

37:33.702 --> 37:35.112
I'm sorry, Red.

37:35.391 --> 37:37.142
I know you two got close.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.796
Yeah, we did.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.844
And can I tell you, Mr. Jones?

37:43.676 --> 37:45.783
I knew he was gonna run.

37:46.054 --> 37:48.197
Even when he told me
he wasn't, I just...

37:48.622 --> 37:49.622
I felt it.

37:50.711 --> 37:52.015
So, uh,

37:52.259 --> 37:53.539
what's next?

37:53.627 --> 37:55.820
- For Frank? He's probably
halfway to Alaska. - No, no.

37:56.211 --> 37:57.527
I mean, for you.

37:59.458 --> 38:00.774
I don't know.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.484
My dad was a decent, good guy.

38:07.684 --> 38:11.358
He worked hard. He loved me.
He loved his life.

38:11.558 --> 38:14.099
I believe he slept peacefully
at night, you know?

38:14.299 --> 38:16.616
Unless I was out
doing some dumb-ass thing.

38:17.651 --> 38:20.838
Some days he won,
and some days he lost.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.711
But, usually, it was a draw,
and that was enough for him.

38:25.105 --> 38:26.601
He was just a...

38:28.113 --> 38:30.343
He was a simple man with honor.

38:32.883 --> 38:34.591
Maybe that's what next for me.

38:34.970 --> 38:35.971
Hmm.

38:39.194 --> 38:40.814
Sounds like a good plan to me.

38:59.491 --> 39:00.807
Well, Mom,

39:00.912 --> 39:02.348
Dad,

39:02.716 --> 39:05.867
I know it's still months away,

39:06.177 --> 39:09.241
but clear your schedules and mark
your calendars for August 15th,

39:09.441 --> 39:10.932
a very special day.

39:11.987 --> 39:13.920
Special in what way?

39:14.229 --> 39:18.163
It's when Barnard welcomes
its incoming freshman class,

39:18.363 --> 39:20.775
including a certain
Veronica Lodge.

39:20.863 --> 39:22.511
Veronica!

39:22.759 --> 39:24.238
You'll be moving me
into my dorm.

39:24.326 --> 39:26.476
I'm sorry.
Did you say "Lodge"?

39:26.676 --> 39:27.867
Yes.

39:29.422 --> 39:30.422
I did.

39:32.201 --> 39:34.873
Going to New York,
seeing Katy,

39:35.206 --> 39:38.367
it reminded me
of something I was missing.

39:40.787 --> 39:43.474
But no need to make a federal
case out of it, Daddy.

39:43.562 --> 39:44.750
No.

39:45.577 --> 39:47.328
Absolutely not, mija.

39:50.637 --> 39:54.101
- Any regrets about
throwing the match? - No.

39:54.189 --> 39:56.328
If I've learned anything
over these last couple days,

39:56.416 --> 39:59.865
it's that I really don't have to
prove anything to these people.

40:00.740 --> 40:02.933
They have no idea
what true honor is.

40:03.212 --> 40:06.973
And you are not
a damsel in distress.

40:07.061 --> 40:09.857
But I'll murder Bret if he
actually has a tape of us.

40:10.335 --> 40:11.593
Speaking of tapes,

40:11.681 --> 40:14.393
I did manage to sneak something
out of the Quill and Skull room.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.171
A videotape labelled "Donna."

40:24.353 --> 40:26.203
We were having an affair.

40:29.274 --> 40:33.421
<i>I knew it was wrong, and I didn't
want anybody to get into trouble,</i>

40:33.593 --> 40:35.649
<i>so I tried to
break it off with him.</i>

40:37.109 --> 40:39.252
<i>But then he got...</i>

40:40.741 --> 40:42.056
<i>aggressive.</i>

40:42.631 --> 40:44.046
Wait. What's going on?

40:44.235 --> 40:47.734
This is exactly what Donna told
me about Mr. Chipping, except...

40:47.888 --> 40:49.250
Wait for this part.

40:49.338 --> 40:53.904
<i>And I was so scared, I told him if he
didn't stop I'd go to the headmaster.</i>

40:55.330 --> 40:57.734
<i>I'd never seen
Mr. Kotter so mad.</i>

40:58.625 --> 41:00.122
Who's Mr. Kotter?

41:00.384 --> 41:02.142
Based on my research,

41:02.302 --> 41:05.044
no one.
He doesn't exist.

41:05.132 --> 41:09.038
Even more chilling,
Donna is 100% using the same language,

41:09.126 --> 41:12.898
even exactly the same words that she
used when she told me about Mr. Chipping.

41:12.986 --> 41:15.460
I didn't want anybody
to get into trouble.

41:15.778 --> 41:18.320
So, I tried to
break it off with him.

41:18.614 --> 41:21.703
But then he got... aggressive.

41:22.338 --> 41:25.185
- Meaning...
- She's lying, Jug.

41:25.377 --> 41:29.486
This is a rehearsed speech
Donna has given at least twice.

41:29.694 --> 41:32.279
All this time, I've been
thinking, we've been thinking,

41:32.367 --> 41:35.437
that Bret's the evil mastermind
behind Stonewall Prep.

41:36.062 --> 41:39.062
But I think we need to be
more worried about Donna.
