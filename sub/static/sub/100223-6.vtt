I learn how to get back there anyway.

have agreed to wait for it?

‐ No, Molly, this isn't love,
this is just blind worship.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.839
VAUGHN: Karolina.
‐ Uh... Speaking of blind worship.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.549
‐ Oh, Leslie will be so happy to see you.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.801
‐ My mom is here?
‐ Yeah. Where else would she be?

11:15.801 --> 11:16.969
This is all her.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.054
‐ And what is this, exactly?

11:19.054 --> 11:20.931
‐ It's the next phase.
‐ Of?

11:20.931 --> 11:24.017
‐ The Church. The light. Everything.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.352
We're post‐Radiance now.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.521
‐ Mom?

11:28.647 --> 11:32.401
‐ Oh, honey, you're okay.
Oh, you were gone so long.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
The baby?
MOLLY: She made it.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.488
Xavin was amazing.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.489
[sighs]

11:39.950 --> 11:42.578
KAROLINA:
Mom, who are all these people?

11:42.578 --> 11:44.788
LESLIE: They came after hearing
what you did at the Crater.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.875
KAROLINA: I put on a show
so that we could escape.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.836
LESLIE: Well, recent events
have convinced me

11:50.836 --> 11:54.590
that there are still so much about
the universe we don't understand.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.384
And there's nothing wrong
with searching for answers.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.512
Look, before you judge...

12:00.512 --> 12:03.182
just try to see the good
that we're doing here.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.062
‐ Thanks for letting me hold your hand.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.523
Needles make me pretty nervous.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.611
Hey, matching scars.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.907
‐ Yeah. Well, so now we don't have to get
tattoos to commemorate the occasion.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.283
‐ Oh.
‐ Yeah.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.119
Oh, God, does it hurt?

12:24.119 --> 12:25.621
‐ Uh...

12:26.038 --> 12:28.957
not as much as a corkscrew
to the eye would have.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.211
Thank God you showed up.
You‐you saved me.

12:32.211 --> 12:34.880
‐ Oh, I just caught you, Molly saved you.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.840
‐ Yeah, that was pretty amazing.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.969
I have never seen someone
throw a person like that before.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.262
‐ Yeah.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.015
Molly's... parents

12:45.015 --> 12:47.726
were... in the circus.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.353
Anyways...

12:49.978 --> 12:51.772
‐ Do you care if I make
a weird transition?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.483
‐ That's my favorite kind.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.069
‐ Today sucked.

12:57.069 --> 13:01.532
But if it ends with a few stitches
and a chance to get to know you better,

13:01.532 --> 13:03.283
it'll pretty much feel like a win.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.660
‐ I'd like that.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.248
‐ Uh, there.
I just added you to my flock.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.250
‐ Flock?

13:11.250 --> 13:12.793
‐ It sounds better than a "murder,"

13:12.793 --> 13:15.295
which is technically
what a group of crows is called.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.297
‐ Oh, so you're like really into this.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.384
‐ I am.
Uh, feels like my purpose.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.845
‐ I'd like one of those.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.847
‐ Well, what's standing in your way?

13:26.515 --> 13:27.724
‐ I mean, life...

13:27.724 --> 13:30.018
a... a lot of stuff.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.520
And with, um...

13:31.520 --> 13:33.438
me and my friends and...

13:33.939 --> 13:35.816
you know, just going back
to things that I want

13:35.816 --> 13:38.485
feels like abandoning them.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.988
‐ Things in our lives only hold us back
if we let them.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.240
When one of us rises, we all do,

13:43.240 --> 13:46.159
and there's nothing selfish
about that, Gert.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.418
NICO:
Well...

13:56.628 --> 13:58.046
you look like yourself again.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.799
‐ Oh, it feels good not to be wearing
Janet Stein's clothes anymore.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.927
That woman never met
a pastel blazer she didn't like.

14:03.927 --> 14:07.723
‐ So, how was Dad
when you got home last night?

14:07.723 --> 14:11.560
‐ I came home and he was gone.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.812
So were his clothes.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.815
I called him and texted him.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.736
He must have woken up
alone in the hospital

14:20.736 --> 14:23.113
and just thought I abandoned him.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.782
‐ But you didn't.
You can explain‐‐

14:25.782 --> 14:28.160
‐ How can I possibly explain
what happened to me?

14:29.912 --> 14:33.415
We tried to make this work
for a long time, but it's too broken.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.043
Time to focus on other things.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.669
Like running Wizard.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.630
Speaking of which, I have to get going.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.090
‐ Wait, you're actually going
into work today?

14:42.090 --> 14:43.342
Like nothing happened?

14:43.342 --> 14:46.553
‐ The world didn't stop when we
disappeared for six months, Nico.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.138
I need to find out what I've missed.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.724
I have calls into everyone on the board,
but so far, no one's returned‐‐

14:50.724 --> 14:52.351
‐ Who cares about Wizard?

14:52.351 --> 14:55.145
Hey, you do remember
we left Alex behind?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.314
You have to tell me how to save him.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.609
‐ Nico...

15:01.902 --> 15:03.904
the Alex you know is...

15:03.904 --> 15:05.405
is probably gone.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.953
I can't let the same thing happen to you.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.997
I'm sorry, but you are never going back.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.999
‐ There has to be a way.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.877
If you won't help me, Morgan will.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.883
‐ You don't know Morgan.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.302
‐ You do.
‐ You can't ask her for help.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.763
‐ Then I'm asking you.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.765
Be my mom and help me.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.228
‐ Nico...

15:38.355 --> 15:40.107
I am helping you.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.526
By keeping you away from Morgan.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.197
My first job as your mother
is keeping you alive.

15:47.906 --> 15:48.991
[phone chimes]

15:53.579 --> 15:54.621
Who is it?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.589
‐ None of your business.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.970
VAUGHN: Leslie insisted I be given
more responsibilities.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.513
‐ Aren't you just the youth group leader?

16:11.513 --> 16:14.308
What other responsibilities
do you have besides snacks?

16:14.308 --> 16:16.852
‐ [scoffs] Okay,
snack's only 80% of the job.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.396
I also have to keep the kids in line.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.564
But it's cool.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.358
I'm pretty tuned in with Generation Z.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.611
Oh, hey, you got a WizPhone on ya?

16:25.611 --> 16:27.654
‐ Yeah. Corvus. Why?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.907
‐ That phone is straight up drippin',

16:29.907 --> 16:31.700
but you're gonna have to lock it in here.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.203
All cell phones and screens are banned.

16:34.203 --> 16:38.123
You know, anything that can distract us
from connecting IRL, sis.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.791
‐ I'm not doing that.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.627
‐ Okay, well, you can have it back
when you leave.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.669
[pans clattering]

16:45.380 --> 16:47.424

16:47.424 --> 16:49.384
‐ Oh, that's Bodhi.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.804
Yeah, he's great.
All the kids here are.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.056
‐ Okay.
‐ I think...

16:54.515 --> 16:55.599
All right.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.520
Well, I'll see you later, <i>okurr?</i>

17:05.067 --> 17:07.152

‐ Dad.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.863
Ahh.

17:12.324 --> 17:13.575
You're healed.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.077
How is this possible?

17:15.077 --> 17:17.162
‐ A lot's happened since I saw you last.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.331
So many wonderful things.

17:19.331 --> 17:21.792
Because I met someone.
‐ Who?

17:24.336 --> 17:25.462
Dad?

17:28.674 --> 17:29.716
Dad?

17:37.182 --> 17:39.601
‐ Enchanting to see you again, Nico.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.942
♪

17:51.446 --> 17:54.825
‐ Go ahead, no one's watching.
Just don't set me on fire.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.994
Burning alive's a terrible way to go.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.204
Just a little witch humor.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.498
‐ Why are you here? How?

18:01.832 --> 18:03.250
‐ You brought me here.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.962
I stood by that door for years, waiting.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.298
As you grew up, so did your power.

18:09.298 --> 18:12.885
Until finally you were strong enough
to let me out.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.345
‐ No, you sent us to that place.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.890
‐ You sent yourself there,
because you're a novice.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.183
Which is not a criticism.

18:19.183 --> 18:22.060
I consider it a failing
of my own mentorship.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.937
‐ Novice or not,
I could kill you right now.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.940
‐ And then what?
You'd still be right where you are.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.276
A little girl with a stick
she doesn't know how to use.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.279
Meanwhile, Alex Wilder is alone.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.114
In the dark.

18:34.114 --> 18:37.451
That's why, as soon as I sensed
you'd returned to <i>this</i> world,

18:37.451 --> 18:40.204
I urged your father
to arrange this meeting.

18:41.872 --> 18:43.999
‐ Did you really have to drag
my dad into it?

18:43.999 --> 18:45.792
MORGAN:
He was my closest connection to you.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.295
When I found him, he was alone.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.047
And broken.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.632
So I healed him.

18:53.926 --> 18:58.764
I'm sure you didn't mean to impale him
with a glass shard

18:58.764 --> 19:01.141
causing coma and paralysis.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.061
But... just look at him now.

19:04.061 --> 19:06.772
It's as if what you did to him
never happened,

19:06.772 --> 19:08.398
and he's truly happy, Nico,

19:08.398 --> 19:11.401
happier than he's ever, ever been.

19:11.401 --> 19:15.697
Your mother didn't recognize him
for the kind, brilliant man he is.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.740
I do.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.867
‐ My mother won't be too happy
you've turned him

19:18.867 --> 19:20.661
into a man‐jewelry‐wearing boy toy

19:20.661 --> 19:23.121
who has way too many buttons
open on his shirt.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.333

in her lifetime.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.710
She has to pay for her sins.

19:29.795 --> 19:34.091
Now, how about you don't kill me
and we have a nice lunch?

19:34.091 --> 19:35.759
The lamb meatballs are amazing.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.554
Of course, all food turns to ash
in your mouth where I've been,

19:38.554 --> 19:40.889
so anything would be exquisite right now.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.353
You know how this works, Nico.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.773
I can't force you to do anything.
You are your own witch.

19:49.773 --> 19:53.360
Whether you want my help or not,
it's up to you.

19:55.737 --> 19:59.700

20:12.296 --> 20:16.300

20:17.342 --> 20:20.846

that plant and disappeared,

20:20.846 --> 20:22.514
Wizard was in crisis.

Oh, we did it together.

And I want you to be a part of it.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.926
‐ They beamed both me and my cow up.

22:22.926 --> 22:26.138
For the longest time,
just talked to the cow,

22:26.138 --> 22:29.224
like... like I think they thought
he was in charge.

22:29.516 --> 22:33.562
‐ Well, they told me they would reveal
the secrets of the universe to me.

22:33.562 --> 22:36.982
‐ Then they probed me, anally.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.483
BEARDED MAN:
Then they probed <i>me.</i>

22:38.483 --> 22:41.195
I don't think they ever probed my cow.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.614
They seemed to respect him too much.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.991
‐ And they probed me
with incredible knowledge

22:45.991 --> 22:48.660
about the meaning of existence.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.829
And with an anal probe.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.458
‐ Oh, actually, I'm just here
to support my friend.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.087
‐ It's okay, Victor, it might help.

23:00.881 --> 23:01.924
‐ Well...

23:02.966 --> 23:05.594
my experience began when an alien

23:05.594 --> 23:07.596
ingratiated himself into my friend group.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.515
[inhales deeply]

23:09.515 --> 23:12.059
He cured my cancer,

23:12.059 --> 23:14.019
by injecting me with his DNA,

23:14.019 --> 23:17.397
which caused me to go berserk
and try to kill my son.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.858
Luckily, my wife shot me in time.

23:19.858 --> 23:23.946
I sabotaged the alien ship
and he responded by leaping into my body,

23:23.946 --> 23:26.281
where I lived in a state
of constant drowning.

23:26.281 --> 23:30.077
While he was in control of my body,
he slept with my wife,

23:30.077 --> 23:31.537
imprisoned my son,

23:31.537 --> 23:34.873
and indirectly forced me
to have sex with her.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.959
The only way I was finally rid of them

23:36.959 --> 23:39.628
was when his energy
was torn from my body

23:39.628 --> 23:41.713
as I was thrown into
an alternate dimension,

23:41.713 --> 23:45.384
where I was forced to relive
childhood abuse over and over again.

23:45.384 --> 23:48.720
‐ When you say that he
injected you with his DNA,

23:48.720 --> 23:50.597
you mean by anal probe, right?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.891
‐ I was never anally probed.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.143
‐ I will not stand for you coming in here

23:55.143 --> 23:57.604
and getting your jollies
by mocking this group.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.022
‐ What?! That's what happened.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.441
‐ Who here is triggered
by this guy's insensitivity?

24:04.319 --> 24:05.487
‐ Real‐‐

24:05.696 --> 24:06.738
Really?

24:06.738 --> 24:09.533
[inhales sharply]
So, where you headed? Home?

24:10.784 --> 24:13.829
‐ Uh, I guess. I mean,
don't really know where to go.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.581
I don't know where Dale is.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.541
And Gert and Molly kind of made it clear

24:17.541 --> 24:19.793
that they need a little time
away from me, so...

24:19.793 --> 24:22.629
‐ I'm working on a project in the lab,

24:22.629 --> 24:24.590
if you wanted a consultant.

of the kids here dance.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.535

Uh, I've...

And, hey, it's safer than the streets.
Or the woods, turns out.

25:48.507 --> 25:50.843
‐ Does Leslie know you're here?
I mean, she didn't say anything.

25:50.843 --> 25:52.052
‐ I've been avoiding her.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.762
You know, Leslie's part
of my old PRIDE life, okay?

25:53.762 --> 25:56.265
I've washed myself clean of that.

And Stacey's fine, too, by the way.
She's not possessed anymore.

Are you gonna go see her?
‐ No.

If I've learned anything, it's that...
everyone's better off without old Dale.

‐ You're not gonna try to make me
go back home, right?

26:17.077 --> 26:19.872
Because I kind of like it here,
and I met some cool kids.

26:19.872 --> 26:21.206

26:27.921 --> 26:30.883
'cause we were overprotective.

old Dale has seen better days,

Oh... I'm so proud
of the woman that you've become.

And the fact that you've forgiven Leslie,
that is amazing.

jealous rage.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.981

28:22.703 --> 28:24.454

28:30.127 --> 28:34.381
which, surprise, my mother is restarting

28:34.381 --> 28:36.884

‐ Are these the new Wizard phones?

28:36.884 --> 28:39.386

She works for Wizard now.
