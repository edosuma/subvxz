And logical too.
Yet we need some help."

12:34.144 --> 12:37.712
"Look, Captain.
Melllvar will help us."

12:41.282 --> 12:44.459
"Captain, I wope he will
welp our vessel."

12:44.588 --> 12:46.200
- Wessel!
- [ Shuddering ]

12:46.330 --> 12:50.682
- You're not acting hard enough!
- Melllvar, you have to
respect your actors.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.860
When I directed Star Trek IV,
I got a magnificent performance
out of Bill...

12:53.990 --> 12:55.861
because I respected him
so much.

12:55.991 --> 12:57.864
And when I directed
Star Trek V,

12:57.994 --> 13:01.998
I got a magnificent performance
out of me because
I respected me so much.

13:05.567 --> 13:09.265
Okay! I'm done "recafoobelling"
the energy-motron!

13:09.397 --> 13:11.268
Or whatever!

13:11.399 --> 13:13.488

"My, what a handsome
energy creature you are.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.976
I love you."

He's drawing strength
from our weapons!

[ Bender ]
Yep.

14:00.447 --> 14:02.624
So, uh,
how's rehearsal going?

14:02.754 --> 14:06.846
Lousy. Here I've been
admiring a bunch of actors,
while you,

14:06.975 --> 14:10.850
a crew of genuine
space heroes, risked
your lives to save them.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.113
Hey, we've done
heroic things too.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.855
Yeah.
In the third season,
I kissed Shatner.

14:15.985 --> 14:19.509
Silence! My whole world
has turned upside down.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.511
I have but one option.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.950
- Keep them and let us go?
- No!

14:24.080 --> 14:27.649
To determine who is more worthy
of my fanatical devotion,

14:27.778 --> 14:32.219
I shall pit you against
each other in armed combat...
to the death!

14:34.090 --> 14:36.222
Where'd you get
an idiotic idea like that?

14:36.352 --> 14:40.009
Episodes 19, 46,
56 and 77!

14:40.139 --> 14:44.927
Great list.
Except you forgot episode 66.
[ Chuckling ]

14:45.057 --> 14:47.581

I was getting to that one!

14:47.711 --> 14:49.889
[ Shouting ]

14:57.808 --> 15:00.682
So Melllvar ordered
a battle to the death.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.250
- I assume no one survived?
- [ Sighs ]

15:03.379 --> 15:06.121
Can we get on with this?
My foot's getting tired.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.081
[ Beeping ]

15:09.211 --> 15:12.128
This will be your standard
battle to the death.

15:12.259 --> 15:15.349
The only weapons--
whatever you can find.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.654
But I warn you.
Do nothing...

15:17.786 --> 15:20.267
until I have signaled
the start of combat.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.009
Okay, start.[ All Gasping, Shouting ]

I don't have much
experience at fighting,
except with you guys.

15:34.236 --> 15:37.457
I have an idea.
Wasn't there an episode where
I threw my shoe at the enemy?

15:37.587 --> 15:40.677
- You mean Doohan?
- [ Both Chuckling ]

15:40.808 --> 15:43.419
Whoever it was,
I did it like this.
Yaah!

15:43.551 --> 15:47.120
- Ow!
- My foot's cold.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.861
There. We can
make these into spears.

15:50.993 --> 15:54.605
And we can tie these
caterpillars together to make
bow strings for bows and arrows.

15:54.735 --> 15:56.912
And we can use this machine gun
to shoot them!

15:57.043 --> 15:59.219
Yee-haw!

16:04.049 --> 16:06.052
[ Clicking ]

16:06.182 --> 16:08.836

That was fun.

16:10.273 --> 16:13.972
What if I distract them
with my famous fan dance?

16:14.102 --> 16:16.149
Oh, that's good,
good, good, good.
And then, George,

16:16.278 --> 16:19.543
you give them
a karate chop.I find that offensive.

16:19.673 --> 16:24.504
Just because
I'm of Japanese ancestry,
you assume I know karate.

16:24.634 --> 16:28.291
Have I ever
led you to believe
I have studied karate?

16:28.422 --> 16:30.990
Well, no.
But you never talk
about yourself.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.644
Maybe if you showed
a little interest.
