01:12.160 --> 01:13.969
That's last year's
Battle of the Year.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.771
It's an international b-boy
competition held in France,

01:16.880 --> 01:19.042
which for the last 15 years

01:19.600 --> 01:21.170
the United States has lost.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.764
I went to a concert
this past weekend,

01:24.840 --> 01:26.444
and I overheard
some high school kids

01:26.520 --> 01:29.524
saying that b-boying
was no longer cool

01:30.440 --> 01:33.011
and it was something
their parents did.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.760
That scared me.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.930
It scared me
because this company,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.365
everything I've built,

01:39.480 --> 01:42.006
started off with b-boying.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.602
It's obviously still
cool over in France.

01:44.680 --> 01:48.048
The government subsidizes
Battle of the Year.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.010
The government is
keeping hip-hop alive.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.805
Still cool in Russia,

01:52.880 --> 01:54.325
Germany,

01:54.880 --> 01:56.370
Korea.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.201
But it's not cool here
where it was founded.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.651
Which would explain why,

02:01.720 --> 02:03.449
domestically,
our sales are down.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.042
Merchandising, record sales,
ticket sales, apparel.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.247
But for the first time
in this company's history,

02:10.400 --> 02:13.370
<i>international sales
are exceeding domestic.</i>

02:13.440 --> 02:14.805
<i>We are in trouble.</i>

02:14.880 --> 02:17.008
<i>Think about it,
if b-boying ain't cool,</i>

02:17.160 --> 02:19.208
<i>how long before
hip-hop isn't cool?</i>

02:19.280 --> 02:22.250
<i>And what will that mean
to our business, our company?</i>

02:23.680 --> 02:25.125
Hey, yo!

02:26.240 --> 02:28.129

sleep when you're dead.

Coming.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.248

do windows, does she?

02:38.360 --> 02:39.691
What the hell are
you doing here, man?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.250
I've been calling,
you ain't been answering.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.881
I've been busy lately.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.930
All right, well, bring your busy
ass over and open up this door.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.201
This ain't
no prison visit.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.807

02:51.920 --> 02:54.048
Look, if you came
here to sweat me, D...

02:54.120 --> 02:55.610
Came here to make
you a proposition.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.325
You gonna
let me in or what?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.290
Okay.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.130
This... This old thing work?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.008
All right. Here we go.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.610
Check this out.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.124
That's Japan versus Korea,
world champions.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.810
I mean,
b-boying ain't the same

03:25.920 --> 03:27.570
from back in the days
when we were dancing, man.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.244
I mean, what's the farthest
we ever had to go to battle,

03:29.320 --> 03:30.367
the Bronx?

03:30.480 --> 03:34.246
Now these kids are battling
in Japan, Germany, France.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.883
So, the Battle of the Year
is coming up, right?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.689
And I'm sponsoring
the US crew.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.931
So my crew is called LA's Finest.
Now, these kids are good.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.651
Acrobatic, they got skills,
but they're not great.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.886
Yet.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.121
Only missing one thing.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.681
You.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.651
I want you
to coach the crew.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.966
Coach?

03:57.040 --> 03:59.327
Now, I know
you need money, so...

03:59.440 --> 04:00.965
Here you go,
check that out,

04:01.040 --> 04:03.361
let me know if that
meets your approval.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.130
But the freestyle
sessions are next month,

04:05.200 --> 04:06.645
and I need you to prepare
my crew for battle.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.643
I was a basketball coach.
It doesn't matter.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.405
A coach is a coach, and you were
the best I've ever seen, man.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.602
It's in your heart.
I ain't that guy anymore.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.921
Just come with me,
let's go check out the boys,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.923
and if you think they suck,
you walk away.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.480
No pressure.
So what are you waiting on?

04:21.560 --> 04:23.085
You don't want me, D.
I mean, seriously,

04:23.200 --> 04:24.565
how many opportunities
do you have

04:24.680 --> 04:26.603
come knocking at
your window every day, WB?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.841
Can't even keep
my own shit straight.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.126
Look, I'm not
gonna stand here

04:29.200 --> 04:30.690
and pretend like I know
what you're going through,

04:30.800 --> 04:32.086
'cause I don't.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.601
But, come on, man,
that fire in your heart,

04:34.680 --> 04:36.523
that need to win
and the ability

04:36.640 --> 04:39.325
to infect those around you and get
them to believe the same thing?

04:39.400 --> 04:42.051

this ain't you.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.691

with you, man,

you and I both know
she's never coming back.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.563
You know what, man?

04:54.560 --> 04:57.086
We're done here.
I was wrong.

The only difference has been
between my life and yours,

I can't make this out, man.
It's chicken scratch.

"If I do this,

"I got to do it
on my own terms."

I put WB up to it or something.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.410
I don't even know
who you are.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.766
What's your name?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.080
Seriously?

12:27.120 --> 12:30.010
I'm Franklyn with a "Y".

12:30.120 --> 12:32.168
How old are you?
I'll be 23 in December.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.810
Franklyn with a "Y", do you know
who these two guys are?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.446
Yeah.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.522
Yeah, y'all were ground-breakers
back in the day.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.483
When I started off
with the crew,

12:42.640 --> 12:44.529
we were called
the Battle Troop Crew.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.762
We battled each other more
than we battled other crews.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.160
Until WB showed up.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.843
<i>Comes up as
a foster kid from Georgia</i>

12:52.000 --> 12:55.129
<i>with this country,
hillbilly-type swag,</i>

12:56.120 --> 12:57.770
but it was something
about him, man,

12:57.880 --> 12:59.609
<i>that he just unified the crew.</i>

12:59.680 --> 13:01.364
<i>He just knows how to
bring people together.</i>

13:01.440 --> 13:02.885
And this is in
the early days of hip-hop,

13:02.960 --> 13:06.203
back before white boys
were rapping and b-boying.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.442
<i>That wasn't around back then.
It was just black and Latino.</i>

13:08.520 --> 13:09.646
That's all we had.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.371
So when we would show up
to a battle, oh, man.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.566
[LAUGHS]

13:13.640 --> 13:14.641
<i>But you know what?</i>

13:14.720 --> 13:16.370
<i>When he'd leave that cipher,</i>

13:16.480 --> 13:18.289
<i>he went from white bread
to Wonder Bread.</i>

13:18.400 --> 13:19.640
<i>That's how good he was.</i>

13:19.720 --> 13:21.484
Guess I know why
you call him WB.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.641
Oh, yeah.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.566
But if he was so dope, then
why did he stop breaking?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.409
<i>He wanted to do
the right thing.</i>

13:28.480 --> 13:30.767
<i>See, back in those days, man,
we were all broke.</i>

13:30.880 --> 13:33.645
There was no money in b-boying.
Sure.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.563
So, when he got his
girlfriend pregnant,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.723
her uncle offered him an assistant
basketball coaching job at St. Mark's,

13:38.800 --> 13:39.926
and he took it.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.161
Wait, not St. Mark's that,
that racked up

13:41.240 --> 13:43.322
all those state championships?
Yeah.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.482
<i>And he was the head coach
at the time that they did it.</i>

13:45.560 --> 13:47.164
<i>FRANKLYN: Then what is</i>
<i>he doing back here?</i>

13:47.240 --> 13:48.241
Starting over.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.481
I don't follow.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.244
Couple years ago,

13:51.320 --> 13:55.325
<i>WB lost his wife and son
in a horrible car accident.</i>

13:56.240 --> 13:57.526
<i>Completely tore
his world apart, man.</i>

13:57.600 --> 13:58.681
<i>I mean, he just...</i>

13:58.760 --> 14:00.762
He checked out.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.765
<i>And I'm hoping that
he's ready to check back in.</i>

14:05.880 --> 14:07.370
<i>And if I'm right,</i>

14:07.440 --> 14:09.841
<i>you're gonna learn more
in five weeks from that man</i>

14:09.920 --> 14:11.922
<i>than you ever would
in five years in this place.</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:13.286
<i>That I promise.</i>

14:13.400 --> 14:17.200
If it doesn't work out, well,
we tried, right, Franklyn

14:17.280 --> 14:19.203
with a "Y"?

14:20.400 --> 14:22.971
Change how you think,
change your life.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.125
B-BOY: There it is.
There it is!

14:31.080 --> 14:32.411
See?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.886
D, didn't I tell you?
Bring on the French.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.008
Bring on
the punk-ass Koreans.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.003
I like that.
Looking good.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.566
I like what I see.
Good job.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.165
Coach, what do you think?

15:04.280 --> 15:07.648
You saw me clapping.
You guys are good.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.165
No disrespect,
but aren't those

15:09.280 --> 15:11.487
the same moves you guys
brought to France?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.011
That wasn't anything
like France.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.320
I've been
watching your tapes.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.930
European tours, regionals.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.525
You've changed
the sequencing, yes,

15:17.640 --> 15:19.688
but it's basically the same
routine as four years ago.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.326
D, didn't I tell you this
coaching thing wasn't gonna fly?

15:22.920 --> 15:26.083
You don't tell me shit.
You understand?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.685
I'm not trying to play
the hard case with you,

15:27.800 --> 15:29.529
but I just want you to know
we do have other options.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.841
Are they threatening me?
Sounds like a threat, right?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.849
Are you threatening me?
Come on, man.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.009
This is your coach. 
What Coach says, you do.

15:37.035 --> 15:37.995
End of story.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.206
Coach?

15:40.280 --> 15:41.691
All right, everybody
line up right here.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.450
Come on, fellas.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.682
All right,
everybody turn to the right.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.724
Chins up, start walking.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.887
Let's take this outside.

16:00.720 --> 16:01.801
What the hell are you doing?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.041
Think they got
options, right?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.326
I brought you here
to make 'em better,

16:04.520 --> 16:05.646
not kick 'em out
into the street.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.484
They may have
a little bit of attitude...

16:07.560 --> 16:09.005
I don't care about attitude.
Bring it.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.247
These guys are stuck, D.
They ain't getting any better.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.810
How long they been a crew,
five years?

16:13.880 --> 16:15.006
Six years.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.361
Even worse.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.725
They've hit
the tipping point.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.168
They've stopped putting all their blood,
sweat and tears into winning a battle

16:23.240 --> 16:25.811
and started putting it
into just not losing.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.331
Trust me, man,
I got a plan.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.641
What you have
is an empty room.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.848
That's what you got.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.242
All right, what's your plan?
Make it good.

16:36.240 --> 16:39.403
Insanity is doing the same
damn thing over and over

16:39.560 --> 16:40.607
and expecting
a different result.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.404
That's what
we've been doing.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.766
It's why we
can't compete, D.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.923
All of our competitors are gonna
bring their best dancers,

16:47.040 --> 16:49.202
but the US, we send
one crew from one city

16:49.400 --> 16:51.528
with maybe two or three
top-tier b-boys on it.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.604
What we should be doing is
cherry-picking the top b-boys

16:54.720 --> 16:57.564
from every crew in
every city across America.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.760
Okay, let me
get this straight.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.845
So you're saying put together
some kind of b-boy all-star team?

17:03.960 --> 17:05.290
A b-boy dream team.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.451
We did the same thing
in basketball,

17:07.599 --> 17:08.964
and we started
that sport, too.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.684
We were getting schooled
in the Olympics

17:10.880 --> 17:12.450
till we put Jordan,
Magic, Bird,

17:12.560 --> 17:14.050
Barkley, Ewing
on the court,

17:14.119 --> 17:15.359
our dream team.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.282
That dream team
had time to prepare.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.282
You do realize you're
trying to put together

17:19.359 --> 17:20.646
a whole new crew in what?

17:20.760 --> 17:22.125
Battle of the Year
is in three months?

17:22.240 --> 17:24.971
Here's the beauty of it. Freestyle
sessions are next week.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.644
All the top crews
are gonna be in town.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.047
Instead of a tune-up
for LA's Finest,

17:29.120 --> 17:31.122
why not turn it into a
try-out for a national team?

17:32.480 --> 17:35.131
When you put the word out
you're sponsoring a dream team,

17:36.280 --> 17:37.566
they'll come in droves.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.802
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.120
So that's your plan?

17:42.280 --> 17:43.406
That's my plan.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.563
It better work.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.924
<i>SWAY: All right, so listen up.</i>

17:56.000 --> 17:59.402

I got the five
elements of death,

19:08.160 --> 19:12.324
footwork, style, power,
originality and soul.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.721
If you ain't got that,
don't even get in the ring.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.928
So why do you break?
Breaking is my everything.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.326
This means everything
in the world to me.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.561
It's the most important
thing in my life.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.484
It's self-expression.
I live it, I breathe it.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.085
I didn't really have much,
and then I found breaking.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.770
After Afghanistan,
I needed b-boying.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.841
Breaking saved my...
Life.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.081
It's the only thing I got.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.401
I'm a b-boy, and I'm gay,

19:28.520 --> 19:30.841
and a lot of people
have issue with that.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.206
Imagine you're
the son of a rabbi

19:32.400 --> 19:33.606
and you're trying
to be cool and break.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.404
You're Jewish and a b-boy.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.929
He's probably adopted.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.525
A main goal that I
think every b-boy has

19:40.600 --> 19:41.761
is Battle of the Year.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.524
Battle of the Year is like
the Mecca of b-boying.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.284
It's like Eli Manning
winning the Super Bowl.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.686
It's like the Olympics
to breaking.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.205
Battle of the Year means...
Everything to a b-boy.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.441
It's the only thing there is.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.124
Why do you deserve
to be on this crew?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.766
There is no dream team without Grifter.
'Cause I'm damn good.

What do you think
about when you battle?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.530
My main focus is,
if I don't win,

20:02.600 --> 20:04.045
I got to go back
to my old life.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.122

Kicking ass.

You are my pick.

I said we're
breaking into teams.

But you didn't become
part of a team, did you?

32:24.280 --> 32:26.362
Yeah, but I just roasted them, Coach.
I smoked...

32:26.440 --> 32:28.920
"I, I, I."
Everything out of you is "I".

32:29.000 --> 32:30.604
You even understand
the concept of a team?

32:30.680 --> 32:32.762
Might be a cliche, son,
but there is no "I" in team,

32:32.840 --> 32:34.046
and there'll be
no "I" in this team.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.122
This ain't no team,
this is a crew!

I'm better than anyone on it!

a problem with those two?

Rooster and Do Knock?

of a really heated Twitter war
