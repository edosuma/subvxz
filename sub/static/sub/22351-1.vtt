battle for a half million

We've got a new house, all new
houseguests and a brand-new

00:13.990 --> 00:16.990
twist that is sure to keep
everyone on their toes and

00:16.990 --> 00:24.990
scrambling all summer long.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.830
For the next three months, the
houseguests of "big brother"

00:28.830 --> 00:31.990
will be cut off from the outside
world, while more cameras and

00:31.990 --> 00:36.990
more microphones than ever
before will capture every single

00:36.990 --> 00:39.990
dramatic moment.

two-night premier event.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.290
If you thought last summer was
twisted, you haven't seen

01:06.290 --> 01:07.990
anything yet.

01:07.990 --> 01:14.990
Tonight we'll unleash three
twists into the game.

01:14.990 --> 01:15.990
One peace a fan favorite.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.950
One is a secret that you will
only know about, America.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.990
And the other twist will shake
up the game each and every week

01:21.990 --> 01:24.990
like never before.

01:24.990 --> 01:27.990
It's called the "bb takeover"
and you'll learn more about it

01:27.990 --> 01:29.990
later in the show.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.990
But first, we can't unleash
anything until we meet the first

01:33.990 --> 01:38.990

01:55.990 --> 01:57.990
I'm from south Carolina.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.290
I stand down in the south.

01:59.290 --> 02:02.990
Everybody has to take a double
look on me and wonder why I'm

02:02.990 --> 02:03.290
wearing camo.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.410
But when I talk to them, it
blows their mind.

02:06.410 --> 02:10.990
Are I was adopted when I was a
beafnlt I don't know my

02:10.990 --> 02:12.990
ethnicity but being country is
what it is all about.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.990
I love everything about it.

02:14.990 --> 02:18.990
Hunting and fishing and hanging
out in the back woods, riding in

02:18.990 --> 02:22.990
trucks with your boys, getting
stuck in mud holes, anything

We're pretty much an old couple.

02:52.990 --> 02:56.990
I love being mannivelative but i
think my personality is

02:56.990 --> 02:58.990
definitely going to be an asset
but I don't think they would see

02:58.990 --> 03:00.290
it coming.

03:00.290 --> 03:07.120
Why wouldn't they trust the
blond girl who is really buff?

venice beach, California.

there's adrenaline involved I'm

in it.

03:25.990 --> 03:28.120
I have broken some bones I can't
count anymore.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.700
My attitude will take me to win
"big brother" because I'm not

03:31.700 --> 03:35.990
afraid to do what it takes to
win!

03:35.990 --> 03:38.990
>> Oh, my god!

going to use that guy and all

04:36.990 --> 04:40.990
his manipulative abilities to
lie my way to the size.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.410

What the houseguests won't know
is that I have a master's degree

04:51.990 --> 04:54.990
in medieval romance literature.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.990
Being a professional wrestler
you have to be athletic, you

04:58.990 --> 05:04.120
have to be able to manipulate a
crowd.

05:04.120 --> 05:10.290
Austin and Judas are going to
win "big brother."

05:49.990 --> 05:52.700
I want to be covered in all
angles of the house.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.990
I don't mind getting blood on my
hands or being covered up to my

05:56.990 --> 05:59.990

the $500,000.

football with no shirt on.

I like to say I'm athletic.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.990
I played football at Texas a&m
university.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.540
It's a way of life.

06:36.540 --> 06:39.990
Playing football you have to be
able to adapt and change.

06:39.990 --> 06:42.290
That's the best way to go into
the game.

06:42.290 --> 06:47.410

A lot of people see plond hair

a girly girl and sure I'm a
girly girl but I'm not afraid to

07:05.990 --> 07:07.990
take things in my own hands.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.990
When I owned my first house, i
ripped out all of the

07:10.990 --> 07:13.990
countertops and all of the
floors by myself.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.830
I get dirty if I have to.

never goes anywhere without his

As soon as this goes on, live
Judas live.

Morgan carefully selecting blood

So how far will you go to win

Will you lie to your housemates?

09:58.990 --> 10:01.990
Will you stab your new best
friend in the back?

10:01.990 --> 10:06.990
Will your showmance become
real-life romance?

10:06.990 --> 10:09.990
Ultimately what happens inside
of the "big brother" house is

10:09.990 --> 10:13.120
completely up to you.

10:13.120 --> 10:16.990

Right now I feel like a cow on
astroturf.

12:21.990 --> 12:24.830
>> Hi, I'm Audrey.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.990
>> Meg, nice to meat you.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.990
>> I'm meeting all of these
people for the first time.

12:29.990 --> 12:33.990
It is definitely a little
difficult for me to even process

12:33.990 --> 12:35.990
anything is that going on --
>> oh, my gosh.

12:35.990 --> 12:41.990
>> This is the first time I'm
going to publicly share my truth

12:41.990 --> 12:48.120
with complete and total
strangers.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.990
>> My name used to be Audrey.

12:49.990 --> 12:50.990
It's a long story.

12:50.990 --> 12:51.990
I will tell you later.

12:51.990 --> 12:55.990
>> Let's check out the rest of
the house.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.990
>> There's only eight of us
right now.

12:57.990 --> 13:00.990
>> Do you think they're just
going to bring in like another

13:00.990 --> 13:02.990
you of homeys or something?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.990
>> I think it's newbies.

13:04.990 --> 13:06.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

13:06.990 --> 13:07.990
Wow!

13:07.990 --> 13:08.990
They totally changed it.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.990
This is amazing.

13:10.990 --> 13:11.990
>> It's like a dance floor.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.950
>> The house is insane.

13:13.950 --> 13:18.290
You have waves on the wall and a
real beachy vibe to it.

13:18.290 --> 13:21.990
There's a see-through floor by
the hoh room.

13:21.990 --> 13:25.990
Your boy Jace is in the house
and I'm here to stay until the

13:25.990 --> 13:25.990
end.

13:25.990 --> 13:30.000
>> So you don't want to wear
dresses up here.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.990
>> I'm taking note -- no dresses
on the bridge.

13:33.990 --> 13:38.120
>> This hang out is dope.

13:38.120 --> 13:49.700
>> That's where the champagne is
>> let's pop it.

13:49.700 --> 13:55.990
>> Nicely done!

13:55.990 --> 13:57.990
>> Hey, let's do it.

13:57.990 --> 14:01.990
>> Everybody should say where
they're from, what they do and

14:01.990 --> 14:01.990
something interesting.

14:01.990 --> 14:03.410
>> Why don't you start no.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.540
>> Oh, man.

14:04.540 --> 14:05.990
My name is Jace.

14:05.990 --> 14:08.990
I'm from Georgia but I live in
venice beach California.

14:08.990 --> 14:12.990
I'm a pedi-cab driver.

14:12.990 --> 14:13.990
Just kidding.

14:13.990 --> 14:17.990
I'm actually a personal trainer
and I work in the private

14:17.990 --> 14:17.990
studio.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.990
>> I think of all of the high
energy, we could connect for

14:20.990 --> 14:21.990
sure.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.700
Hopefully they don't get ai'm
not going though.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.990
>> My sister Gabby she is in
love with you.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.990
>> Is she as good looking as
you?

14:28.990 --> 14:30.990
>> Well no beard.

14:30.990 --> 14:31.990
>> Hopefully not.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.290
>> My name is Clay.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.990
>> I'm from Texas.

14:34.990 --> 14:39.830
A small town, and currently I'm
a grad student at Texas a&m.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.990
>> I decided not tellal group i
just finished playing football

14:43.990 --> 14:44.990
for a&m.

14:44.990 --> 14:48.990
I do not I don't want to put a
necessary target upon my back.

14:48.990 --> 14:52.990
My mom is a wildlife
rehabilitator so we have all

14:52.990 --> 14:54.950
kinds of animals at our house.

14:54.950 --> 14:58.290
>> O, lord, Clay is going to get
me in trouble this summer.

14:58.290 --> 14:59.830
>> I'm 23.

14:59.830 --> 14:59.990
>> A baby.

14:59.990 --> 15:03.990
>> I'm 10 years older than this
guy but I don't think I care.

15:03.990 --> 15:07.410
I mean age is just a number,
right?

15:07.410 --> 15:11.990
He is really --
>> ok.

15:11.990 --> 15:12.990
So I'm shelli.

15:12.990 --> 15:16.990
I am a home stager and interior
decorator.

15:16.990 --> 15:19.990
I have two brothers and sisters
and one of my brothers is my

15:19.990 --> 15:20.120
twin.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.410
So hi, Wes, my twin brother, my
favorite.

15:23.410 --> 15:28.120
>> There's a lot of good looking
women in this house.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.120
Shelli, she takes the cake.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.990
>> The best story about us is i
was way up here and so they

15:32.990 --> 15:34.990
could only see him.

15:34.990 --> 15:42.700
And I have a heart murmur so
they could only see the heart.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.410
There's a heart murmur.

15:45.410 --> 15:49.990
>> Our hearts are going to be
murmuring together this summer

15:49.990 --> 15:51.990
because oh, my gosh my heart is
definitely beating for you right

15:51.990 --> 15:52.990
now!

15:52.990 --> 15:56.990
>> So my name is da'vonne and
i am 27.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.990
I have a 7-month-old dawrkts
hey, Caden.

16:00.990 --> 16:01.990
Seven months.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.990
And I'm Hawaii schoolteacher.

16:03.990 --> 16:04.830
>> Great.

16:04.830 --> 16:04.990
>> Second grade.

16:04.990 --> 16:06.990
>> The best grade.

16:06.990 --> 16:07.540
>> Appreciate that.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.990
>> I am not a second grade
teacher.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.990
I'm definitely a poker dealer.

16:11.990 --> 16:15.990
Any great poker dealer is a
great poker player and a poker

16:15.990 --> 16:18.990
player has mastered the art of
bluffing and we all know bluff

16:18.990 --> 16:22.700
is another word for lying so
they don't need to know that I

16:22.700 --> 16:25.950
can tell a lie, just like that
there.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.290
>> I'm from Los Angeles.

16:27.290 --> 16:27.990
I'm 30 years old.

16:27.990 --> 16:32.990
My pictures were scouted for the
wwe and I became a professional

16:32.990 --> 16:32.990
wrestler.

16:32.990 --> 16:33.990
>> Shut up!

16:33.990 --> 16:35.990
>> Yes.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.540
So yeah, I know, I got injured
badly.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.290
I tore my hip and had a repair
and then there's no hiding the

16:43.290 --> 16:44.990
fact that I'm a big dude.

16:44.990 --> 16:48.290
I'm playing up all of these
wrestling injuries but little do

16:48.290 --> 16:51.990
they know I'm 100% healed.

16:51.990 --> 16:52.990
>> I'm Meg.

16:52.990 --> 16:54.990
I live in New York City.

16:54.990 --> 16:55.990
Right in the heart of it.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.000
I'm a waitress and I'm on "big
brother," what is happening?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.410
What is happening?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.990
>> Wow, Meg, you're looking hot.

17:02.990 --> 17:06.990
I knew you were trouble when you
first walked n looking like

17:06.990 --> 17:07.540
Taylor swift.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.990
For a country boy like me, she
definitely taking a pilot bite

17:10.990 --> 17:11.990
of my cake.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.540
>> I'm James.

17:13.540 --> 17:14.990
I'm 31 years old.

17:14.990 --> 17:19.990
And I'm from Wichita falls Texas
and I'm also a south carolinian

17:19.990 --> 17:19.990
as well.

17:19.990 --> 17:23.990
Interesting fact is that I'm
Asian and I'm country and I love

17:23.990 --> 17:26.290
hunting and four wheeling and
all of this other stuff.

17:26.290 --> 17:30.990
>> When he opens his mouth and
it's like, yeah, I'm James and

17:30.990 --> 17:33.000
I'm from south Carolina and I'm
like wait a minute.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.700
I also have a 3-year-old little
girl.

17:35.700 --> 17:36.990
Her name is Bailey.

17:36.990 --> 17:37.990
She's at home with her mother.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.990
I love you, Bailey.

17:39.990 --> 17:40.540
And I'm here.

17:40.540 --> 17:41.990
>> Thank you.

17:41.990 --> 17:46.990
>> So my name is Audrey.

17:46.990 --> 17:47.990
And I'm 25.

17:47.990 --> 17:50.990
I'm from a little charming town
outside of Atlanta.

17:50.990 --> 17:55.990
I'm a digital media consultant.

17:55.990 --> 18:02.990
Something interesting about me
is that I am the first

18:02.990 --> 18:05.950
transgender person to be on "big
brother"!

18:05.950 --> 18:07.990
>> What?

18:07.990 --> 18:09.700
>> Yes, yes, yes.

18:09.700 --> 18:13.990
>>
>> oh, my god!

18:13.990 --> 18:16.990
>> You look amazing.

18:16.990 --> 18:17.990
>> Fantastic!

18:17.990 --> 18:19.830
You look awesome.

18:19.830 --> 18:22.290
You look awesome.

18:22.290 --> 18:26.120
>> I've completely transitioned
like three years ago.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.990
>> Most people can't accept who
they are and for you to come out

18:29.990 --> 18:30.990
and be like -- this is amazing.

18:30.990 --> 18:35.990
>> This is my first time meeting
a transgender person.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.990
It just through me for a hoop
but people are going to judge

18:38.990 --> 18:38.990
heifer.

18:38.990 --> 18:41.990
I can relate to that as well,
being Asian and growing up in

18:41.990 --> 18:44.120
the south I get that all the
time too.

18:44.120 --> 18:50.990
>> This is technically my first
time admitting it on a public

18:50.990 --> 18:53.990
forum.

18:53.990 --> 18:58.000
>> I said my piece to the house
and everybody seeps super cool.

18:58.000 --> 18:58.990
Which is great.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.950
This is "big brother."

19:00.950 --> 19:03.990
There's only one winner and now
it's game time.

19:03.990 --> 19:06.990
Buckle up, bitches.

19:06.990 --> 19:07.990
>> There's definitely more.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.990
>> They're going to bring people
back in.

19:09.990 --> 19:13.990
>> We have badass people in the
house.

19:13.990 --> 19:16.990
>> Yeah.

19:16.990 --> 19:22.990
>>
>> oh, yeah!

19:22.990 --> 19:27.990
>> Coming up, I'll reveal a
fan-favorite twist to the

19:27.990 --> 19:28.990
houseguests.

19:28.990 --> 19:32.990
And later, something new that
will shake up the house all

19:32.990 --> 19:34.990
summer long!

19:34.990 --> 19:35.990
Stay with us.

19:45.990 --> 19:46.950
>> Yeah.

19:46.950 --> 19:47.990
This is a nice group.

19:47.990 --> 19:49.990
>> Well I think it always starts
out that way.

19:49.990 --> 19:53.990
It takes a minute before it gets
real.

19:53.990 --> 19:55.990
>> I want girls to do well this
time.

19:55.990 --> 19:56.990
>> Me too.

19:56.990 --> 20:00.990
>> I want to be like the first
person that just jumps in but

20:00.990 --> 20:04.990
I'm a little nervous about guys.

20:04.990 --> 20:07.990
>>
>> yeah.

20:07.990 --> 20:11.990
>> Are you going to be joining
our workouts out there?

20:11.990 --> 20:13.990
>> I do like six days a week.

20:13.990 --> 20:18.990
>> I work out.

20:18.990 --> 20:20.990
>> You ate cookies?

20:20.990 --> 20:23.700
What are you going to do?

20:23.700 --> 20:31.120
>> I sense like a really strong
energy, strong vibes, for sure.

20:31.120 --> 20:34.990
So Audrey, shelli and myself are
having a conversation and it's

20:34.990 --> 20:38.990
like we are tiptoeing around the
words to have an alliance but

20:38.990 --> 20:42.990
then it's like this unspoken
like mutual agreement, this

20:42.990 --> 20:46.830
seems like the perfect
opportunity to take a leap.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.990
>> I'm thinking of an alliance.

20:48.990 --> 20:49.410
>> Oh, my god.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.950
>> I like this first impression.

20:51.950 --> 20:51.990
I do.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.990
>> I feel good about it.

20:53.990 --> 20:57.290
>> As we're having this
conversation I'm looking back

20:57.290 --> 21:00.990
and forth and I'm thinking both
of these girls look like they

21:00.990 --> 21:01.990
could be strong competitors.

21:01.990 --> 21:05.990
Before I know it we're forming
an alliance on day one.

21:05.990 --> 21:10.830
The three of us could work well
together and this might be a

21:10.830 --> 21:10.990
smart move.

21:10.990 --> 21:14.540
>> It has to be a secret.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.990
>> So we are will talk names and
stuff later.

21:18.990 --> 21:23.990
>> But we have to be calculated
how we do it and when we do it.

21:23.990 --> 21:28.990
>> I definitely want to make
sure a girl wins this season.

21:28.990 --> 21:29.990
Female power, baby.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.990
Watch out, boys!

21:31.990 --> 21:33.990
>> Hell, yeah.

21:33.990 --> 21:41.290
Hell, yeah.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.990
>> What's going oranges y'all.

21:43.990 --> 21:46.990
>>
>> we have a lot of y'all in

21:46.990 --> 21:46.990
here.

21:46.990 --> 21:51.410
>> I say your guys sometimes.

21:51.410 --> 21:51.990
Oh, your guys.

21:51.990 --> 21:53.410
>> Hey y'all.

21:53.410 --> 21:54.990
>> Do you have brothers and
sisters.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.990
>> I have an older brother and
an older sister.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.700
>> I have an older brother.

21:58.700 --> 22:03.540
>> So how was -- like you went
through this whole I guess

22:03.540 --> 22:04.990
journey, how was your family
with it?

22:04.990 --> 22:08.990
>> My family is really
conservative.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.990
They didn't know how to deal
with it.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.990
They got terrible advice from a
psychologist and the

22:13.990 --> 22:17.990
psychologist recommended i
should go to one of those

22:17.990 --> 22:19.990
troubled youth wilderness
programs.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.990
They had two escorts come, take
me from my bed in the middle of

22:23.990 --> 22:28.990
the night and I'm thrown in the
woods with all of these guys,

22:28.990 --> 22:33.990
real alcohol abuse problems and
drug abuse and that's when my

22:33.990 --> 22:37.290
parents were like we need to
communicate with this child.

22:37.290 --> 22:37.990
No one else is help.

22:37.990 --> 22:42.830
>> Growing up in Texas I never
met a transgender person.

22:42.830 --> 22:46.990
I thought I had hard times but
listening to hers it put so much

22:46.990 --> 22:47.120
in perspective for me.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.990
>> So your family has now
since --

22:49.990 --> 22:56.830
>> everybody makes mistakes and
they kind of owned up to it and

22:56.830 --> 22:59.990
acknowledged like this is where
we messed up and I'm grateful to

22:59.990 --> 23:01.990
them and it's unbelievable how
close we are.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.290
>> That's a nice story.

23:03.290 --> 23:04.990
>> Yeah.

23:04.990 --> 23:07.990
>> So Audrey is telling her
story and I'm just like, okay, I

23:07.990 --> 23:11.990
do feel bad for you but at the
same time I feel like you adding

23:11.990 --> 23:14.990
a little salt and pepper to the
story and spicing that up, mama

23:14.990 --> 23:18.000
and I'm watching everybody in
the room eating out of the palm

23:18.000 --> 23:21.990
of her hand and I'm thinking
yes, girl, pull them in.

23:21.990 --> 23:23.410
This is what we need.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.410
This is excellent for our
alliance.

23:25.410 --> 23:25.990
Keep it up.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.410
>> I appreciate you telling us.

23:27.410 --> 23:28.990
>> That's awesome.

23:28.990 --> 23:28.990
>> Definitely.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.410
>> I'm glad you're here.

23:30.410 --> 23:30.990
>> Yeah.

23:30.990 --> 23:38.120
I would like to stay here so --
[Laughter]

23:38.120 --> 23:41.990
>> .

23:41.990 --> 23:46.290
>> Julie: Houseguests I need
everyone to gather in the living

23:46.290 --> 23:48.990
room, please.

23:48.990 --> 23:52.990
Hows everyone doing so far?

23:52.990 --> 23:52.990
Excellent.

23:52.990 --> 23:57.000
Well, I'm sure you all know why
I'm talking to you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.990
Did you hear twist?

23:58.990 --> 24:01.000
>> Bring them out, Julie.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.990
>> Did I hear twist?

24:04.990 --> 24:06.990
Tonight I'm going to reveal two
twists to you.

24:06.990 --> 24:10.830
>> Come on, Julie!

24:10.830 --> 24:13.700
>> Julie: One is a fan
favorite.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.990
The other is something
completely new!

24:17.990 --> 24:23.990
First up, the fan favorite --
one of the biggest and best game

24:23.990 --> 24:26.990
changers played out last summer.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.990
>> Battle of the block.

24:28.990 --> 24:31.990
>> The battle of the block.

24:31.990 --> 24:36.990
Once again, you could go from
being head of household to being

24:36.990 --> 24:40.990
evicted in the same week.

24:40.990 --> 24:42.990
>> Thanks Julie.

24:42.990 --> 24:47.410
>> Julie tells us battle of the
block is back and I'm thinking,

24:47.410 --> 24:50.950
crap, I could be hoh and be
going home at the same time.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.990
Nobody is safe at this point.

24:52.990 --> 24:55.830
>> Julie: Let me remind you how
it works.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.990
50e67 week two heads of head of
household will be crowned and

24:58.990 --> 25:03.990
each hoh will nominate two
houseguests for eviction.

25:03.990 --> 25:08.990
That means four houseguests will
be on the chopping block.

25:08.990 --> 25:15.990
These pairs of nominees will
compete against each other in

25:15.990 --> 25:18.120
the battle of the block
competition.

25:18.120 --> 25:22.830
The winning duo will not only be
saved from the chopping block

25:22.830 --> 25:30.990
but their victory will be thrown
the hoh who nominated him

25:30.990 --> 25:34.990
sending him or her back to the
pool of regular houseguests.

25:34.990 --> 25:38.990
>> I'm unsure how I feel about
the battle of the block coming

25:38.990 --> 25:39.410
back.

25:39.410 --> 25:42.290
On one end it's really great
because you have a chance to

25:42.290 --> 25:42.990
save yourself.

25:42.990 --> 25:45.990
If you are open the block.

25:45.990 --> 25:47.990
On the other hand that means
four people are going to be

25:47.990 --> 25:51.700
nominated so you have a much
better chance of being put on

25:51.700 --> 25:53.990
the block in the first place.

25:53.990 --> 25:57.950
>> Julie: It's time for your
first head of household

25:57.950 --> 26:00.990
competition.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.990
[Cheering]
>> Oh, my god.

26:02.990 --> 26:09.950
>> One of you is about to become
hoh number one.

26:09.950 --> 26:13.990
But before you head outside you
have a decision to make.

26:13.990 --> 26:21.540
One of you will be sitting this
competition out.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.700
Please discuss amongst
yourselves.

26:23.700 --> 26:29.990
I'll see you in the back yard
shortly with your answer.

26:29.990 --> 26:33.990
>> Who knows what the other side
of this could be.

26:33.990 --> 26:37.290
>> I'm thinking maybe it's a
good idea I stood out.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.990
>> I'll do it if you promise not
to nominate me.

26:39.990 --> 26:45.950
>> Before I had a chance to say
anything, da volunteered.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.830
>> I'm thinking I will sit out.

26:47.830 --> 26:50.410
I'm thinking this could be a
positive for me in the game or

26:50.410 --> 26:52.990
this could be the trip back to
inglewood.

26:52.990 --> 26:53.990
>> I think that has to be fair.

26:53.990 --> 26:56.990
>> That's fair.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.990
>> You guys agree?

26:58.990 --> 27:02.990
I hope that doesn't mean I'm an
automatic nominee.

27:02.990 --> 27:05.990
>> Julie: When we return we
will crowd the first head of

27:05.990 --> 27:06.990
household of the summer.

27:06.990 --> 27:12.990
Then I'll reveal the bb takeover
twist to you and the

27:12.990 --> 27:12.990
houseguests.

27:12.990 --> 27:18.410
And later, a third secret twist
that's for your ears only,

27:18.410 --> 27:18.990
America!

27:18.990 --> 27:18.990
Stay with us!

27:18.990 --> 27:19.990
[ Applause ]
>> Julie: It's now time for the

27:36.990 --> 27:37.990
first head of household
competition to begin.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.120
But before we get things started
let's head to "entertainment

27:42.120 --> 27:44.990
tonight's" Kevin Frazier who is
in the back yard on the red

27:44.990 --> 27:46.990
carpet for tonight's big event.

27:46.990 --> 27:52.990
>> I have to tell you Julie, we
are anxiously awaiting the debut

27:52.990 --> 27:56.990
of the "big brother" film uf oh,
no.

27:56.990 --> 28:00.990
I had a chance to screen it and
it's horrible.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.950
Let's hope it goes well tonight.

28:02.950 --> 28:03.990
Let's get down to business!

28:03.990 --> 28:07.700
>> Oh, my god!

28:07.700 --> 28:12.990
>> So I walk outside for the
first time and I'm smack dab in

28:12.990 --> 28:15.990
the middle of a Hollywood movie
premier.

28:15.990 --> 28:19.990
I see red carpet, movie possess
terse.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.990
He's finally made it to
Hollywood.

28:21.990 --> 28:22.000
>> Oh, my god.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.990
>> I'm looking at Kevin Frazier
from "entertainment tonight" and

28:25.990 --> 28:28.990
all that is going through my
mind is oh, my god he was

28:28.990 --> 28:29.950
beautiful.

28:29.950 --> 28:32.990
I mean his face was glowing.

28:32.990 --> 28:35.700
I got giddy, like a school girl.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.990
>> Come on over.

28:36.990 --> 28:41.950
>> They made a movie of your
life, who would play the lead

28:41.950 --> 28:41.990
role?

28:41.990 --> 28:42.990
>> Johnny Depp.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.540
>> But who would play you.

28:44.540 --> 28:47.990
>> Scarlet Johansson is going to
play my role too.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.410
Come on Jace.

28:49.410 --> 28:49.990
Let's get real here.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.990
>> Have you ever dated anyone
famous.

28:51.990 --> 28:52.410
Not yet.

28:52.410 --> 28:56.120
>> Who are you hoping to date
one day that is famous.

28:56.120 --> 28:56.990
Ryan Reynolds.

28:56.990 --> 29:01.950
>> I'm standing next to Clay,
who looks exactly like Ryan

29:01.950 --> 29:01.990
Reynolds.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.990
As soon as I said that I was
like oh, boy!

29:04.990 --> 29:06.990
>> Look at you.

29:06.990 --> 29:07.990
>> How is it going.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.990
>> Look at you!

29:09.990 --> 29:10.830
>> I see it.

29:10.830 --> 29:13.990
>> I'm just saying look at you!

29:13.990 --> 29:14.990
>> I'm looking.

29:14.990 --> 29:16.990
>> You keep walking.

29:16.990 --> 29:18.990
Go look at yourself later.

29:18.990 --> 29:23.990
>> I think Kevin Frazier ain't
never seen no hillbilly Asian

29:23.990 --> 29:23.990
before.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.990
>> Julie, back to you.

29:25.990 --> 29:27.990
>> Julie: Hello houseguests.

29:27.990 --> 29:30.990
It's now time for the first head
of household competition of the

29:30.990 --> 29:33.990
summer!

29:33.990 --> 29:36.990
Whoever wins this competition
must nominate two houseguests

29:36.990 --> 29:39.990
for eviction.

29:39.990 --> 29:47.990
Welcome to the bb film premier
of ufo no!

29:47.990 --> 29:51.990
Unfortunately this film has
received horrible reviews, which

29:51.990 --> 29:58.990
is why we're callings this
competition flying tomatoes.

29:58.990 --> 30:04.990
Open my go, the critics will
begin weighing in and the

30:04.990 --> 30:06.120
tomatoes will slide.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.990
The first houseguest to catch 10
tomatoes and put them in their

30:09.990 --> 30:11.990
Karen will be the first head of
household!

30:11.990 --> 30:13.990
But be careful.

30:13.990 --> 30:17.990
Fall off your platform and
you're out of the game!

30:17.990 --> 30:20.990
This competition begins now!

30:20.990 --> 30:23.990
[Buzzer]
(Dramatic music).

30:33.410 --> 30:37.990
>> Going into this competition,
everyone knows winning the first

30:37.990 --> 30:41.990
head of household is a big deal,
even with the battle of the

30:41.990 --> 30:44.990
block and the new twist that is
going to be coming our way, head

30:44.990 --> 30:50.990
of household is the most
powerful position in the house.

30:50.990 --> 30:56.990
>> Gosh!

30:56.990 --> 31:04.990
That's one for Clay, one for
Austin and two for James.

31:04.990 --> 31:10.990
>> That was a low blow.

31:10.990 --> 31:17.120
>> That's strong, man!

31:17.120 --> 31:18.990
>> I'm pretty confident.

31:18.990 --> 31:22.990
I just finished playing football
at Texas a&m so I feel like this

31:22.990 --> 31:35.950
competition is right up my
alley.

31:35.950 --> 31:38.830
>> Oh, my god!

31:38.830 --> 31:47.990
And one swoop we have lost Meg,
Austin and we have lost Clay!

31:47.990 --> 31:48.540
Unsaved by Jace.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.990
>> 30-seconds?

31:49.990 --> 31:52.120
I could have lasted longer than
that.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.410
That's embarrassing.

31:54.410 --> 31:58.990
>> James caught the last one and
in the lead with three.

31:58.990 --> 31:59.990
The rest of you have none.

31:59.990 --> 32:04.990
>> I thought Clay and Austin
would be my two biggest

32:04.990 --> 32:05.990
competitors in the competition.

32:05.990 --> 32:09.990
Now that they have fallen off
I'm thinking this hillbilly

32:09.990 --> 32:17.990
Asian has got it in the bag!

32:17.990 --> 32:20.990
>> That is one bad review.

32:20.990 --> 32:23.990
>> Taste like real tomato juice.

32:23.990 --> 32:26.990
>> I decide not to participate
in the competition.

32:26.990 --> 32:29.990
I see everybody getting hit with
all of these tomatoes.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.990
If I would have got that tomato
all up in this we've it would

32:32.990 --> 32:37.990
have been a problem so I'm
sitting up in the sideline, that

32:37.990 --> 32:42.990
might have been a good idea.

32:42.990 --> 32:44.990
>> Give me some more.

32:44.990 --> 32:56.990
>> It looks like "Carrie" at the
end of the movie!

32:56.990 --> 32:59.990
>> Another save by Jace.

32:59.990 --> 33:04.990
>> I have been skating my entire
life so I think I have the upper

33:04.990 --> 33:06.990
hand on the competition.

33:06.990 --> 33:09.000
Unlike the skateboard there's no
grip tape.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.990
Have you ever tried to skate
without grip tape?

33:11.990 --> 33:12.990
You can't skate.

33:12.990 --> 33:15.990
>> James three, Jace one.

33:15.990 --> 33:19.990
Shelli and awe Audrey, zero.

33:19.990 --> 33:25.990
>> That's ok, that's all right!

33:25.990 --> 33:27.990
>> There you go.

33:27.990 --> 33:41.990
>> Audie!

33:41.990 --> 33:43.990
>>
[Bell rings]

33:43.990 --> 33:51.950
>> Julie: That was a flurry of
bad press!

33:51.950 --> 33:54.990
We have a three-way tie!

33:54.990 --> 33:57.990
Audrey just tied it up.

33:57.990 --> 33:59.990
Audrey, Jace and James.

33:59.990 --> 34:01.990
Five tomatoes a piece.

34:01.990 --> 34:04.990
Shelli with three.

34:04.990 --> 34:08.990
>> I'm feeling really good about
my connection with Audrey.

34:08.990 --> 34:11.990
We kind of have an alliance
already started and she is

34:11.990 --> 34:13.990
totally kicking butt in this
competition.

34:13.990 --> 34:18.990
If I can't pull this one off my
girl Audrey will be able to do

34:18.990 --> 34:19.540
it.

34:19.540 --> 34:31.990
>> James takes the lead with six
tomatoes.

34:31.990 --> 34:34.120
>> James!

34:34.120 --> 34:34.990
With seven tomatoes.

34:34.990 --> 34:38.990
>> I see you over there, big
dog.

34:38.990 --> 34:39.990
>> Beginner's luck.

34:39.990 --> 34:40.990
>> I don't know if I believe
that.

34:40.990 --> 34:43.990
>> You're a baseball coach.

34:43.990 --> 34:43.990
Admit it.

34:43.990 --> 34:46.990
>> Baseball coach, plays for the
Yankees.

34:46.990 --> 34:49.990
>> James is a tough physical
threat.

34:49.990 --> 34:54.990
There may be a little more to
James than being an old country

34:54.990 --> 34:54.990
boy.

34:54.990 --> 34:57.290
>> Oh, my god.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.540
>> James withality.

34:59.540 --> 35:00.540
In the lead.

35:00.540 --> 35:07.290
>> I'm only two tomatoes away
from winning the first hoh

35:07.290 --> 35:12.700
I got to get this win
even though everyone

35:12.700 --> 35:14.990
seems accepting of me as
a transgender

35:14.990 --> 35:18.990
I still don't know where i
stand politically

35:18.990 --> 35:24.000
its super important of
bring the win home win

35:24.000 --> 35:32.990
it is really getting slippery
the board is really going

35:32.990 --> 35:49.990
want everyone to see I can hang
oh and everyone is down

35:49.990 --> 35:54.990
well have to check the replay
ill be back in just a minute

35:54.990 --> 35:58.990
fours of us hit the ground
all come down to instant replay

35:58.990 --> 36:17.950
see who hit the ground last
i want to win so bad

36:17.950 --> 36:21.990
>> we fall off the plank the all
others are off at the exact same

36:21.990 --> 36:23.990
time. That means there's going
to be an instant replay.

36:23.990 --> 36:24.990
>> Heads up.

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
We have a winner.

36:25.990 --> 36:35.990
>> We check tape.

36:35.990 --> 36:38.990
[Buzzer]
>> And because James was the

36:38.990 --> 36:42.540
last foreign touch the red
carpet, congratulations, James,

36:42.540 --> 36:45.990
you are the first head of
household of the summer!

36:45.990 --> 36:48.990
>> I just won hoh.

36:48.990 --> 36:51.120
I told you guys I wasn't going
nowhere.

36:51.120 --> 36:51.990
I'm a competitor.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.990
That's what I come here to do.

36:53.990 --> 36:58.990
I'm not going back to Texas yet
baby.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.990
>> You are the beast, dude.

37:00.990 --> 37:05.990
>> I'm a little bummed I didn't
win the first head of household

37:05.990 --> 37:07.990
competition but there's another
twist coming up and we don't

37:07.990 --> 37:10.990
know what that is so this might
actually about good thing.

37:10.990 --> 37:13.990
>> So James wins head of
household this week and I have

37:13.990 --> 37:17.990
no clue what is going to through
this little roly-poly's head.

37:17.990 --> 37:22.990
Looks like I'm going to have to
kick his little cammo ass and

37:22.990 --> 37:30.990
hope he doesn't nominate me this
week.

37:30.990 --> 37:36.990
>> I feel like we're the chicks
that survived a horror story

37:36.990 --> 37:36.990
movie.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.990
>> Your hair is like straw.

37:39.990 --> 37:40.990
It's like pinestraw.

37:40.990 --> 37:41.990
>> Oh, my god.

37:41.990 --> 37:45.120
>> Julie: Houseguests I need
everyone to gather in the living

37:45.120 --> 37:45.990
room please.

37:45.990 --> 37:46.990
>> No way.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.830
When we look like this?

37:48.830 --> 37:49.410
>> All right.

37:49.410 --> 37:51.700
You're all seated.

37:51.700 --> 37:51.990
Excellent.

37:51.990 --> 37:58.700
Now, remember how I told you i
had two twists to reveal?

37:58.700 --> 38:01.990
Well, I revealed the fan
favorite.

38:01.990 --> 38:05.990
That means it's time for
something new.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.990
>> Oh, my god.

38:06.990 --> 38:13.990
>> From team America to coaches
to the mvp, twists have always

38:13.990 --> 38:21.410
been a staple of "big brother"
and have always changed up the

38:21.410 --> 38:21.990
game.

38:21.990 --> 38:32.990
But no houseguest has ever had
to endure a new twist each and

38:32.990 --> 38:33.830
every week until now.

38:33.830 --> 38:34.950
>> What?

38:34.950 --> 38:34.990
>> Oh, my god.

38:34.990 --> 38:36.990
>> Every single week?

38:36.990 --> 38:42.990
>> Welcome to the bb takeover.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.000
>> What does it mean?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.990
>> Bb takeover?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.990
What does that even mean.

38:47.990 --> 38:52.990
>> Julie: The bb takeover will
unleash new twists into the game

38:52.990 --> 38:53.990
throughout the summer.

38:53.990 --> 38:59.990
Any time you hear this (Â™ª get
ready for a takeover â™ª

38:59.990 --> 39:09.990
â™ª ) Get to the living room,
because that means a takeover is

39:09.990 --> 39:11.540
in effect.

39:11.540 --> 39:11.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

39:11.990 --> 39:15.990
>> You never know who or what it
will be.

39:15.990 --> 39:23.990
What you can be sure of is that
you will need to expect the

39:23.990 --> 39:25.990
unexpected every single week.

39:25.990 --> 39:32.990
Good luck, houseguests.

39:32.990 --> 39:33.990
>> Oh, my gosh!

39:33.990 --> 39:35.990
What is going on this summer,
man.

39:35.990 --> 39:39.950
>> Does that mean a twist for
the week or twist for the game.

39:39.950 --> 39:40.990
>> I think for the week.

39:40.990 --> 39:44.290
>> Or does it represent the
flip-flop of hoh.

39:44.290 --> 39:49.990
>> We will -- what if they throw
a saboteur in here.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.410
>> How do we prepare?

39:52.410 --> 39:52.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.990
>> There's going to be a twist
every week.

39:54.990 --> 40:00.000
>> That means that this game is
never going to settle down.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.990
Everyone is going to be on
fridge day one.

40:02.990 --> 40:06.990
People's true colors are going
to be coming out real soon.

40:06.990 --> 40:10.990
>> Julie: When we return we
will give you a sneak peek at

40:10.990 --> 40:13.990
the next group of houseguests
who will be moving in tomorrow

40:13.990 --> 40:14.990
night.

40:14.990 --> 40:18.990
Plus, I'll reveal another game
changer to you, America.

40:18.990 --> 40:22.120
That's guaranteed to have
everyone seeing double!

40:22.120 --> 40:24.990
Stay with us.

40:40.990 --> 40:43.990
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

40:43.990 --> 40:46.990
It's now time to reveal a twist
to you that will be a complete

40:46.990 --> 40:48.990
secret to the houseguests.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.990
It's called the twin twist.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.700
And here is how it works.

40:53.700 --> 40:57.290
One of the houseguests this
summer has an identical twin.

40:57.290 --> 41:01.990
The other howvghts have no idea
but both twins will be taking

41:01.990 --> 41:07.990
turns living in the house and
competing as one person!

41:07.990 --> 41:08.990
That's right.

41:08.990 --> 41:13.990
These two will be constantly
switching places playing at one

41:13.990 --> 41:14.990
houseguest.

41:14.990 --> 41:20.990
So the big question is, can
these twins fool the other

41:20.990 --> 41:20.990
houseguests?

41:20.990 --> 41:24.990
Because if they can survive the
first five evictions, they both

41:24.990 --> 41:31.990
earn the right to enter the game
and play as individual

41:31.990 --> 41:31.990
houseguests.

41:31.990 --> 41:36.990
So see if you can tell who will
be taking turns in the game with

41:36.990 --> 41:37.990
their twin.

41:37.990 --> 41:40.990
They could already be in the
house or they might be one of

41:40.990 --> 41:45.990
these houseguests who will be
moving in tomorrow night!

41:45.990 --> 41:47.990
>> Yes I'm going.

41:47.990 --> 41:49.990
>> I'm very feisty.

41:49.990 --> 41:52.950
>> I don't have a filter but i
know how to control it.

41:52.950 --> 41:56.120
>> Working at the grocery store
is obviously not my dream job.

41:56.120 --> 41:59.950
>> Working for other people for
minimum wage is not good.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.700
>> I'm known for being one of
the best poker players.

42:02.700 --> 42:05.990
>> The skills it takes to play
poker are similar to "big

42:05.990 --> 42:05.990
brother."

42:05.990 --> 42:07.990
>> I'm all in.

42:07.990 --> 42:09.990
>> We're going to "big brother."

42:09.990 --> 42:09.990
Let's do this.

42:09.990 --> 42:12.950
>> I'm a huge nerd and a geek
and proud of it.

42:12.950 --> 42:15.990
>> If you like a socially
awkward engineer who is terrible

42:15.990 --> 42:17.990
at holding a conversation I'm
your guy!

42:17.990 --> 42:19.990
>> I'm going to "big brother."

42:19.990 --> 42:21.990
>> It's "big brother" time.

42:21.990 --> 42:23.120
Kiss me goodbye.

42:23.120 --> 42:28.990
>> Tune in tomorrow night as the
remaining houseguests move in!

42:28.990 --> 42:33.990
Plus, the bb takeover twist
begins as our first surprise

42:33.990 --> 42:36.990
guest delivers a game changer.

42:36.990 --> 42:41.700
Then, Sunday at
8:00, 7:00 central, the first

42:41.700 --> 42:46.290
nomination ceremony, the first
battle of the block, and the bb

42:46.290 --> 42:49.990
takeover, all continue to shake
up the game.

42:49.990 --> 42:53.990
For now, let's eavesdrop on the
houseguest.

42:53.990 --> 42:56.990
From outside of the "big
brother" house I'm Julie chen,

42:56.990 --> 42:59.410
and I will see you tomorrow
night there.

at least we at the present time

43:20.990 --> 43:24.990
have to sit up on a board for
four hours.

I wouldn't want to do that
