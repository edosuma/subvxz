00:00.001 --> 00:03.035
[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter</i> .

00:03.037 --> 00:03.769
Ah!

00:03.771 --> 00:05.704
[grunting]

00:05.706 --> 00:07.439
[ONE]
Someone sold us out.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.175
[SIX] My real name is
Lieutenant Kal Varrick.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.511
[TWO] I get the sense that she
might know a way out of here.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.580
Seriously? We are really
gonna try to escape

00:14.582 --> 00:18.183
from the inescapable prison
on a moon with no atmosphere.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.152
We're the crew of the Raza.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.154
You're damn right
we're doing it.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.555
[JACE]
Long time, no see.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.503
[WOMAN] They need to understand
that no one messes with me.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.538
No, cut 'em loose.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.890
[WOMAN chuckles]

00:40.891 --> 00:42.241
[WOMAN]
Yeah, I don't care.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.575
Well, if they're smart,
they'll see it coming,

00:43.577 --> 00:46.545
and if not, I've got
no sympathy for them.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.381
Yeah, just do it.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.306
You know what?

00:51.307 --> 00:53.230
I'm gonna have to go
because Hughes is about

00:53.231 --> 00:55.154
to interrupt me with
some very important news.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.723
[HUGHES]
We have confirmed reports

00:57.725 --> 00:59.158
that the fugitive ship Raza

00:59.160 --> 01:01.226
was captured by
the Galactic Authority.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.063
And what does that
have to do with me?

01:04.065 --> 01:06.598
[HUGHES] This was the crew
manifest forwarded to

01:06.600 --> 01:09.101
the Galactic Authority.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.271
Hah.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.073
I don't believe it.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.341
We finally found her.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.743
Hello, pumpkin.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.862
What exactly is going on here?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.464
Sit down.

01:44.839 --> 01:48.474
Why has the trial
been postponed?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.242
[SHADDICK] According to
your commanding officer,

01:50.244 --> 01:53.512
you were on board the Raza for
approximately 3 and 1/2 months.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.181
That's correct.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.849
But two months in,
you lost contact.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.283
[SIX]
I was compromised.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.518
Two members of the
crew discovered I was

01:59.520 --> 02:01.687
Galactic Authority
and planned to kill me.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.855
Evidently they failed.

02:02.857 --> 02:04.289
They didn't get a chance.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.941
Five saved me.

02:05.942 --> 02:07.592
She wrote a program intending
to target their memories

02:07.595 --> 02:09.761
during stasis,
but instead it wiped the

02:09.763 --> 02:12.197
memories of the entire crew.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.600
Including your own.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.704
Lieutenant Anders
reported your memory loss

02:18.706 --> 02:21.373
after your encounter
on Arrakis Sadr.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.925
He told me the truth.

02:22.926 --> 02:24.476
[SHADDICK] And he arranged
for you to acquire the assets

02:24.478 --> 02:26.311
needed to complete your mission.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.464
[SIX]
That's right.

02:28.465 --> 02:30.616
Neurotoxin and an explosive
device to cripple the engines.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.917
But you didn't act.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.552
At least not right away.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.521
I was in a difficult position.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.589
After the memory wipe
you had no way of knowing

02:37.591 --> 02:39.491
that you weren't
really one of them.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.860
You had to assume they
were your partners,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.484
your friends.

02:43.485 --> 02:45.107
What are you suggesting?

02:45.108 --> 02:46.730
I'm suggesting that your
judgment may have been clouded.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.934
I brought them in.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.769
Not right away.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.571
I just needed time.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.673
And you're sure it had nothing
to do with the destruction

02:54.675 --> 02:58.377
of a Mikkei research
facility on Iriden 3?

02:59.413 --> 03:01.380
They were illegally
conducting research

03:01.382 --> 03:04.249
into white hole technology,
and it literally

03:04.251 --> 03:06.685
blew up in their faces.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.720
That's only the
official version.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.356
Unofficially, there were rumors
that the device was stolen

03:11.358 --> 03:14.293
from another corp. and
delivered by a third party

03:14.295 --> 03:17.663
in a ploy to test it and
let Mikkei take the fall.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.865
If that's true,
some would consider that

03:19.867 --> 03:21.833
a deliberate act of war
by one corporation

03:21.835 --> 03:23.302
against another.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.571
It also means whoever
delivered the device

03:25.573 --> 03:29.241
could be considered
an accessory to mass murder.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.679
I know the Raza was there.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.981
I can't prove it yet,
but I will.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.749
We're done for now.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.957
[WARDEN]
This is gonna be a problem.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.426
No kidding.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.995
But what if we
don't cooperate?

03:49.996 --> 03:52.563
We're under contract to the GA,
she's the ranking GA officer.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.867
Yeah, but who does
she really work for?

03:55.869 --> 03:59.805
I don't know, but we
may have to move up

03:59.807 --> 04:01.406
our timetable.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.646
[SHADDICK]
Emily Kolburn.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.548
That's your real name
in case you didn't know.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.016
I know.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.619
For now, I'm sticking with Five.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.322
Great.

04:16.323 --> 04:19.024
Five, can you tell me how
you ended up on the Raza?

04:19.026 --> 04:20.626
I don't remember.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.295
[SHADDICK]
Care to speculate?

04:23.297 --> 04:26.765
At first I thought maybe...
kidnapping victim.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.934
But then I read your
file and I realized:

04:28.936 --> 04:30.936
there's no one out there
who would give a damn

04:30.938 --> 04:32.904
if you were taken.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.973
Now I'm thinking stowaway.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.509
Maybe. I-I dunno.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.744
[SHADDICK]
Why didn't they get rid of you

04:38.746 --> 04:40.879
first chance they got?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.982
Because you made
yourself useful.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.652
What did you do on that ship?

04:48.689 --> 04:51.590
I fixed things.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.492
I-I have a head for gadgets,
electronics, stuff like that.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.728
[sighs]
That's unfortunate.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.863
Why?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.531
That potentially
makes you an accomplice

04:59.533 --> 05:02.067
to any illegal activity
conducted while

05:02.069 --> 05:03.435
you were onboard.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.155
So what?

05:06.156 --> 05:08.874
Including the murder of
15,000 people on Iriden 3.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.345
[sighs]

05:13.347 --> 05:15.881
You're making a mistake.

05:15.883 --> 05:19.418
You think you're
protecting your friends.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.020
There's already enough evidence
from their previous crimes

05:22.022 --> 05:24.690
to put them away forever.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.726
You are the only one who
has anything to lose here.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.862
If you can convict them
without my help, then do it.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.331
Leave me alone.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.899
What about Lieutenant Varrick?

05:33.901 --> 05:34.966
Six?

05:34.968 --> 05:36.668
What about him?

05:36.670 --> 05:37.903
[SHADDICK]
He's about to perjure himself

05:37.905 --> 05:40.038
to protect you
from these charges.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.975
If you admit to your involvement
and tell me everything,

05:43.977 --> 05:46.511
I can guarantee you immunity,

05:46.513 --> 05:49.114
and he won't have
to sacrifice himself.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.119
He made his choice.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.721
[SHADDICK]
Hmph.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.526
Listen, you little shit,
I can make life

06:01.528 --> 06:04.629
very ugly for you.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.765
I can lock you away
in a tiny cell

06:06.767 --> 06:10.769
until you're old
and gray and broken.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.939
Or I can play nice.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.941
No, I don't think you can.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.143
What makes you say that?

06:18.145 --> 06:21.646
Because you're obviously
an incredible bitch.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.883
[WARDEN] You got balls, kid,
I'll give you that.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.852
She hasn't given
anything up yet.

06:26.854 --> 06:31.423
No, but I got a feeling this GA
bitch is just getting started.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.459
She's already lined up the
other three for their sit downs.

06:34.461 --> 06:37.863
Well, then, you'd better make
sure we get to them first.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.932
Do you think that's a good idea?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.000
This happens under her nose,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

06:42.002 --> 06:46.104
Look, this is a direct
ask from Traugott Corp.

06:46.106 --> 06:51.476
And they scare me a hell
of a lot more than the GA.

06:51.478 --> 06:55.914
Traugott wants them dead,
just make it happen.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.065
I think it's a raisin.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.735
At least I really
hope it's a raisin.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.007
You gonna eat that apple?

07:25.546 --> 07:28.213
[NYX]
So, how's it coming?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.581
How's what coming?

07:29.583 --> 07:30.649
[NYX]
Your escape plan.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.451
There is no escape plan.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.852
We were told to keep
our noses clean.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.620
That's what we're doing.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.856
You mean Arax?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.724
You're telling me you're scared?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.993
We're not looking for trouble.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.462
Are you kidding me?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.563
Three things I know for sure:

07:44.565 --> 07:47.866
you don't scare;
you thrive on trouble;

07:47.868 --> 07:49.935
and if you want off this rock,
you're going to need my help.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.520
How do you figure that?

07:51.521 --> 07:53.104
Even if you could just
snap your fingers,

07:53.106 --> 07:55.907
make every guard disappear,
unlock every door,

07:55.909 --> 07:57.175
you're still not going anywhere.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.844
There's only one
way off this rock,

07:58.846 --> 08:00.078
and that's by shuttle.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.546
They know that,
which is why they never

08:01.548 --> 08:03.114
keep one docked for very long.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.649
What's that got to do with you?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.051
It's all about the timing.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.887
And it just so happens
that I know the supply run

08:08.889 --> 08:10.155
schedule for the next month.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.923
How?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.825
[NYX] I've got a
little operation going,

08:13.827 --> 08:17.162
trading goods for services,
like information.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.663
So you deal in contraband.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.633
I offer hard-to-source
products for discerning

08:21.635 --> 08:24.536
and... cooperative buyers.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.872
You see, that's how
things work around here.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.673
Quid pro quo.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.109
And what would you
want in return, Nyx?

08:31.111 --> 08:34.012
Your extra pillow
and a hug goodbye.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.881
What do you think it is I want?

08:35.883 --> 08:37.282
[GUARD A]
This is what I like.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.583
All together.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.951
Saves me the trouble.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.153
These three got a
new work detail.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.622
[THREE]
All right.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.090
I'm done washing other
people's underwear.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.992
You're on waste disposal.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.894
At least let me finish mine.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.262
Whatever this is.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.030
We'll pack it up for you.

09:06.179 --> 09:09.114
[THREE] You know,
someday, we're all gonna

09:09.116 --> 09:11.716
look back on this
and still be very angry.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.653
[INMATE A]
Hey!

09:14.655 --> 09:16.655
Save your chitchat
for the showers!

09:17.891 --> 09:18.924
[sniffs]

09:18.926 --> 09:20.743
We're on the clock.

09:20.744 --> 09:22.561
Whatever doesn't get
recycled gets incinerated.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.962
Come on, let's go.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.000
[INMATE A]
All right, move your asses.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.602
We don't have all day.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.809
You better watch yourself...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.210
[TWO]
Let's go.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.014
Lucky boy.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.255
--[TWO] Hey!
--[THREE] What the hell?!

09:58.131 --> 10:00.665
[THREE]
Hey, open up!

10:00.667 --> 10:02.133
Hear me?!

10:02.135 --> 10:04.703
I'm sure he can
hear you just fine.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.373
[THREE]
Come on.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.211
I thought laundry duty was bad.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.084
[coughing]

10:20.887 --> 10:22.187
[TWO grunts]

10:22.189 --> 10:23.788
[THREE]
Good luck.

10:36.336 --> 10:40.071
[coughing]

10:40.073 --> 10:42.090
You okay?

10:42.091 --> 10:44.108
I'd say somewhere between
rare and medium-well.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.844
You son of a bitch.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.412
Look at you, all hot
under the collar.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.648
What the hell was that?

10:49.650 --> 10:51.416
[ARAX]
An unfortunate accident.

10:51.418 --> 10:55.053
In a place like this,
they happen all the time.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.655
Am I right?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.260
Walk away.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.328
You gotta be kidding me.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.263
Walk away.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.940
Yeah?

11:19.980 --> 11:22.814
You just made a huge mistake.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.090
You tell Kazan those
three are with me now.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.393
[INMATE A]
It's your funeral.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.201
Android.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.936
Hello, Lieutenant.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.905
What's this?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940
A necessary precaution.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.009
I intend no harm to anyone.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.912
And yet you refuse to cooperate.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.180
What are you talking about?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.414
[SHADDICK]
She has a detailed record

11:56.416 --> 11:58.450
of everything she
experienced on that ship,

11:58.452 --> 12:00.485
but she's refusing
to release the files.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.786
Can't you just extract them?

12:01.788 --> 12:03.355
Normally, yes.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.923
But she's created an
elaborate security protocol

12:04.925 --> 12:06.357
that'll wipe
everything if we try,

12:06.359 --> 12:08.893
including her
personality matrix.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.428
That's a little
extreme, isn't it?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.831
Effectively, you cease to exist.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.333
As do we all... eventually.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.969
By refusing to cooperate,
you're disobeying a direct order

12:17.971 --> 12:19.738
from a human superior.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.006
My loyalty is to my crew.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.042
I take my orders from them.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.312
[SHADDICK]
Over to you.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.849
Android, I understand
what you're trying to do.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.517
But it's pointless.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.887
I'm ordering you to cooperate
with the investigation.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.889
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.674
Why not?

12:39.675 --> 12:41.458
[THE ANDROID] Because you're
no longer a member of this crew.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.362
In fact, it's arguable
if you ever really were.

12:49.035 --> 12:57.175
Murder, assault, piracy,
arson, theft, smuggling.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.977
I don't recall.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.915
I honestly can't remember.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.851
Do you think that fact
somehow absolves you

13:06.853 --> 13:08.319
from your past crimes?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.954
No.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.056
Although I'm sure there
are others who do remember

13:12.058 --> 13:14.058
and would love to remind me.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.162
Your propensity for
violence is remarkable.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.682
Thank you.

13:20.683 --> 13:23.234
For years you've left behind a
wake of misery and destruction.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.938
I have also been told that
I chew with my mouth open.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.239
What's your point?

13:28.241 --> 13:30.575
My point is,
none of it matters...

13:30.577 --> 13:32.243
...if you play your cards right.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.828
Really?

13:33.829 --> 13:35.412
[SHADDICK] I don't care
about the crimes you committed

13:35.415 --> 13:37.415
before the mind wipe.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.284
I'm only interested
in what happened

13:39.286 --> 13:41.586
after you woke up from stasis.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.521
Specifically,
the events leading up to

13:43.523 --> 13:45.857
and immediately
following your delivery

13:45.859 --> 13:49.127
of the white hole device
that destroyed Iriden 3.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.361
Doesn't ring a bell.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.097
[SHADDICK]
Hmm. No?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.302
Planet killer.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.504
Over 15,000 lives lost.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.941
Still nothing?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.342
Look, why don't we
just cut to the chase

14:04.344 --> 14:06.144
and call this what it really is.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.378
Okay.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.413
It's a whitewash.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.764
It's a cover-up.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.114
You're looking for
someone to take the fall.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.450
I'm looking for the truth.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.552
Even if the truth could
start a corporate war?

14:14.554 --> 14:18.356
[SHADDICK] I'm prepared to offer
a deal to whoever talks first.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.557
I'm not interested.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.292
Forget it.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.880
I'm listening.

14:24.881 --> 14:27.232
Full immunity from any
prosecution across the board.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.033
A clean slate.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.969
In exchange for testimony
that corroborates

14:30.971 --> 14:34.072
what we already know.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.408
I'm just getting
settled in here.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.212
Do you know that I put a down
payment on a new toothbrush?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.515
This deal should be of
particular interest to you,

14:44.517 --> 14:47.485
given the recent developments.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.621
This is an extradition request.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.990
There's an Ishida
cruiser in orbit.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.593
They say they're not leaving
until we turn you over.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.530
You've been convicted
in absentia.

14:59.532 --> 15:03.034
If I sign this order, they
will deliver you back to Zairon

15:03.036 --> 15:05.536
for public execution.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.307
Take the day to think about it.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.276
The cruiser's not
going anywhere.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.447
It reflects poorly on
the command structure here

15:16.449 --> 15:19.117
when my own guards
cannot arrange the deaths

15:19.119 --> 15:21.286
of a few prisoners.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.221
There were unforeseen
circumstances.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.222
What happened?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.390
[DURAND]
Arax Nero.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.258
He and his crew
stepped in, saved them.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.143
[WARDEN]
Why?

15:28.144 --> 15:29.027
Who are they to him?

15:29.029 --> 15:31.062
I dunno.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.497
Maybe it's a shakedown.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.299
He wants his piece
of the payout.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.334
Or maybe he's just pissed
we didn't come to him first.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.936
You know how touchy
these guys get.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.504
Anyway, what's the problem?

15:39.506 --> 15:40.638
They didn't talk.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.073
We'll get 'em next time.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.507
[WARDEN] The problem is
someone is requesting

15:43.510 --> 15:45.610
immediate visitation rights.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.178
[DURAND]
Deny 'em.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.446
I cannot.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.048
Who is it?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.085
Hey.

15:54.087 --> 15:58.256
If we're going back to my cell,
we're going the wrong direction.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.092
I suppose you boys
already know that, right?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.062
[THREE]
Whatever.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.631
Hello, my friend.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.299
It's been a while.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.342
This is a surprise.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.376
I'll say.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.744
I was expecting Two.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.112
Hmm.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.048
But, you'll do, I suppose.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.684
Nice to see you, too.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.188
So what brings you by?

16:30.190 --> 16:32.156
Gonna pull a few strings?

16:32.158 --> 16:35.259
Get us sprung for
old time's sake?

16:35.261 --> 16:38.296
Unfortunately,
the list of charges

16:38.298 --> 16:40.631
that you're facing
makes that impossible.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.534
I'm afraid it does
not look very good.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.269
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.355
I hear they've been
questioning you

16:47.356 --> 16:49.440
about the destruction of our
research facility on Iriden 3.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.209
The subject has come up.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.212
I also hear none
of you are talking.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.680
That's unfortunate.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.682
'Cause if we come
clean then the blame

16:57.684 --> 17:00.618
for all that illegal
research shifts from Mikkei

17:00.620 --> 17:03.421
to certain other parties.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.590
As it rightly should.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.760
We incriminate ourselves
in the process.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.295
I believe you were
offered a deal.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.264
Did you authorize that deal?

17:15.268 --> 17:18.036
Offer the deal
to all three of us.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.670
Look...

17:19.672 --> 17:22.807
...it's not just your
freedom that's at stake here.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.643
As long as you're alive,
you are a liability

17:25.645 --> 17:29.180
to certain parties,
as you put it.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.749
But you come clean now,
well, they have no reason

17:31.751 --> 17:33.384
to go after you.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.657
Did you really think
that was gonna work?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.259
--[TRUFFAULT] No.
--Nah.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.693
But I figured it
was worth a shot.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.528
Good try.

17:43.530 --> 17:44.946
[TRUFFAULT chuckles]

17:44.947 --> 17:46.363
Well, good luck to you, then.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.100
Do me a favor:

17:49.102 --> 17:51.369
Consider what I said?

17:51.371 --> 17:53.071
Sure.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.240
[TRUFFAULT]
No...

17:56.242 --> 17:58.743
Look me in the eye.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.244
Tell me you'll think about it.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.648
[chuckles]

18:08.588 --> 18:11.756
There is not a chance in hell
that I will think about it.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.429
Say hi to the rest
of the gang for me.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.600
Yeah, I will.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.797
They let you have
makeup in this place?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.900
It's illegal in here,
but if you have connections

18:55.902 --> 18:57.301
like I do, then--

18:57.303 --> 19:00.171
Two days rations for a lipstick.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.672
You got a date tonight?

19:01.674 --> 19:02.773
Just give me the lipstick.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.375
Come on.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.675
You wanted it the hard way.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.853
[TWO] What do you mean
she gave you something?

20:22.855 --> 20:25.656
It's kinda hard to explain.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.392
It's better if I just show you.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.562
Look under the mattress.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.964
What?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.612
[THREE] It's the layout
to this entire prison.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.314
Including restricted areas.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.749
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.783
Yeah.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.585
Someone's coming.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.357
Arax wants to see you.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.566
I hope you don't mind,
but I figured

21:08.568 --> 21:12.536
you'd be looking to thank me
for saving your life.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.938
Thanks.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.539
My pleasure.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.509
Hey, are those grapes?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.777
Go ahead.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.846
Help yourself.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.014
You can relax.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.349
You three are now
under my protection.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.685
Well, that's convenient,
because for a while there,

21:27.687 --> 21:30.988
you were the one who
we needed protection from.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.690
[THREE] How'd you sneak
these grapes past security?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.292
I mean, seriously.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.627
No, forget it.
I don't wanna know.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.929
I had a change of heart.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.798
I'm giving you the go-ahead.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.066
You want us to escape?

21:42.068 --> 21:44.935
I want us to escape.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.971
You come up with a plan,
I'm coming with.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.673
That's the deal.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.541
What do we get out of it?

21:50.543 --> 21:53.911
My blessing...

21:53.913 --> 21:55.546
And help on the outside.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.415
[TWO] You're gonna have
to do better than that.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.649
What do you need?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.084
A riot.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.520
When the time comes,
I need your crew to instigate

22:02.522 --> 22:05.323
a brawl that will set
off the security protocol.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.757
When that sonic
disabler goes off,

22:06.759 --> 22:08.759
we'll all be down for the count.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.361
Not all of us.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.831
[COOMBS]
No, sorry.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.899
Can't let you in.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.500
Let her through.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.641
[ARAX]
What do you want, Nyx?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.643
I know what this
conversation is about.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.545
Nyx has kindly
offered to help us out.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.879
[NYX]
Except there's a problem.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.581
The regular supply
shuttle's been suspended

22:30.583 --> 22:32.717
until further notice.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.518
We're not going anywhere.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.931
[ARAX] So the supply run's
been temporarily suspended.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.733
So what?

22:48.735 --> 22:50.601
Sooner or later,
it's gonna start up again.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.536
We just got to be patient,
give it some time.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.539
And hope we can outlast those
who are gunning for us in here.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.108
No, man, we don't have the time.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.510
We don't have a ship either.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.479
[FOUR]
Actually...

23:01.481 --> 23:02.947
I think I can get one.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.455
[SHADDICK] So I hear
you're ready to talk deal.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.558
No.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.826
I'm here to end the discussion.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.095
I'm passing on your offer.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.531
If I sign this order,
you will be shipped

23:20.533 --> 23:22.833
back to Zairon for execution.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.637
I look forward to returning
to my home world.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.039
Even if only for a short visit.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.728
Is that your report?

23:33.729 --> 23:35.413
Yeah, Shaddick wants me to file
it before the end of the--

23:35.415 --> 23:37.548
Is there anything in
there about Iriden 3?

23:37.550 --> 23:38.449
What do you know about that?

23:38.451 --> 23:40.301
[ANDERS]
Delete it.

23:40.302 --> 23:42.152
The crew of the Raza is not
getting off this rock alive.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.021
The warden's been
paid off, the fix is in.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.790
I didn't bring them here
to be assassinated.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.425
Nothing you can do about it.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.294
I'll talk to Shaddick.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.162
[ANDERS] She doesn't give
a damn about them or you.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.030
She just wants to make
her case against Traugott.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.899
Don't you see what's
going on here?

23:54.901 --> 23:57.001
Ferrous and Mikkei are busy
worrying about each other,

23:57.003 --> 23:58.736
meanwhile, some of the
other players get together

23:58.738 --> 24:00.571
and decide it's time
to make a move.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.207
Hell, they already got to
Moss, and he was connected.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.842
What are you talking about?

24:04.843 --> 24:06.476
[ANDERS] Your friend Moss,
the one with Corso's face.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.479
They killed him.

24:08.481 --> 24:09.914
Now you understand?

24:12.819 --> 24:13.918
Come on.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.653
The crew of the Raza--

24:15.655 --> 24:18.589
how did you think this
was gonna finish for them?

24:18.591 --> 24:21.959
Their fates were
sealed a long time ago.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.129
But there's no reason
for you to go down with them.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.673
If you're not gonna help me,
you can't blame me

24:35.675 --> 24:37.775
for trying to help myself.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.544
What?

24:40.546 --> 24:42.112
I'm sorry.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.048
A little late, don't you think?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.801
[SIX]
I made a mistake.

24:46.802 --> 24:49.553
I thought I was part of a system
that stood for something,

24:49.555 --> 24:51.722
but it was all a lie.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.959
You wanna prove you're sorry?

24:54.961 --> 24:56.861
Then help us.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.664
[THREE] So assuming
we pull this thing off,

25:00.666 --> 25:02.766
and despite my normally
super-positive outlook,

25:02.768 --> 25:06.070
I am not convinced that we will,

25:06.072 --> 25:07.605
we're leaving crew
members behind.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.973
We don't even know
where they are

25:08.975 --> 25:10.207
or what happened to them.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.610
Their best chance
out of here is us.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.112
Free, armed, and
back on the Raza.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.781
You're convinced you can fly
this ship without The Android?

25:17.783 --> 25:20.050
--Wh--
--Meant robot.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.852
I'm dying to find out.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.921
[GUARD A]
Lin!

25:24.924 --> 25:26.790
You got solitary.

25:26.792 --> 25:27.958
Again.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.125
I didn't do anything.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.928
Just following orders.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.264
[TWO sighs]

25:37.703 --> 25:39.670
You watch yourself, Boone.

26:07.633 --> 26:11.702
Didn't expect to
see you until the trial.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.172
[SIX]
I'm Galactic Authority.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.874
Yeah, I know.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.076
I figured it out.

26:19.078 --> 26:22.947
So? What the hell?

26:22.949 --> 26:24.682
Look, I don't have time
to get into that right now.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.650
I bribed a couple of
guards to make this happen.

26:26.652 --> 26:29.053
Well, then you understand
how things work around here.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.021
Everyone has their price.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.890
Not everyone.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.024
I wanna help you.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.693
You're the reason we're here.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.178
[SIX]
Look, you can hate me later.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.662
Right now, your
lives are in danger.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.064
[TWO]
Yeah, that much I already know.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.666
What I don't know is
why we should trust you.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.820
[SIX]
Whether you believe it or not,

26:45.821 --> 26:48.973
I still care about you guys.
Besides, you've got no choice.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.944
[FOUR]
It's been arranged.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.612
The Ishida cruiser's sending
a shuttle to come pick me up.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.281
When it gets here,
we make our move.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.015
Where's Two?

26:58.017 --> 26:59.316
In solitary.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.050
[FOUR]
What did she do?

27:00.052 --> 27:01.168
Nothing.

27:01.169 --> 27:02.285
[ARAX]
I reached out to my connections.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.887
They'll find out
what's going on.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.856
[THREE] But we need boss lady
to pull this thing off,

27:05.858 --> 27:07.391
so we gotta delay.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.925
No, we don't have time.
My people are coming.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.165
Injure yourself.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.034
Get yourself admitted
to the infirmary.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.669
Buy us some time.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.903
No.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.405
What do you mean "no"?

27:21.406 --> 27:22.906
I'd sooner let them
take me back to Zairon

27:22.908 --> 27:26.110
before I dishonor myself.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.280
Listen...

27:30.282 --> 27:31.882
[grunts]

27:35.221 --> 27:38.856
When this is over, and we're
celebrating on some beach,

27:38.858 --> 27:41.325
he'll be okay with this, right?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.060
Better hope so.

28:02.415 --> 28:04.181
[WOMAN B]
Wake up, Ryo.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.224
It's me.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.093
Misaki.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.130
Misaki?

28:19.131 --> 28:22.166
Now<i> Han</i> -<i> Shireikan</i> of the
Imperial Royal Guard of Ishida.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.068
I was appointed commander
following the death

28:24.070 --> 28:26.804
of our old friend Akita-<i> san</i> .

28:28.941 --> 28:30.941
<i> Gomen nasai</i> , Ryo.

28:30.943 --> 28:35.045
It seems not so long ago
we were stealing away

28:35.047 --> 28:38.382
from our studies,
going to the beach to practice

28:38.384 --> 28:41.752
our swordsmanship on the sand.

28:41.754 --> 28:43.420
What happened to you?

28:45.024 --> 28:50.194
Murderer, fugitive,
and now, coward,

28:50.196 --> 28:53.030
seeking the temporary
refuge of medical regulations.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.264
I'm not a coward.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.233
Doesn't matter.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.736
The warden has approved
your immediate transfer.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.271
Delay tactics won't work.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.009
It's time to go home, Ryo.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.056
You can take that thing off.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.794
[SHADDICK]
She's going to cooperate now.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.196
Our little friend
had a change of heart.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.831
Actually, I lied.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.401
I just wanted one
last chance to say goodbye.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.341
[FIVE grunts]

29:46.152 --> 29:48.552
[SHADDICK] This bitch
is tired of playing nice.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.454
Order her to release
her memory stores,

29:50.456 --> 29:52.222
or you're dead, little girl.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.962
[DEVON] Whoa, what the hell
is going on here?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.898
We're taking custody
of the prisoner.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.200
[DEVON] Okay, that man
is on concussion protocol.

30:03.202 --> 30:04.568
Okay? He's not to be moved.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.970
The warden has made
an exception.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.372
Go.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.725
Okay, look.

30:11.726 --> 30:13.109
There is a real danger
that that man won't get

30:13.112 --> 30:15.145
to wherever you're taking him.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.580
He should be so lucky.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.368
It's on.

What is it gonna be, kid?

31:24.416 --> 31:25.349
Okay.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.984
I'll talk to her.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.655
[FIVE] Android, as a member
of the crew of the Raza,

31:31.657 --> 31:34.324
you have to follow
my orders, right?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.559
That's correct.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.095
You'll do what I tell you to do.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.596
Of course, Five.

Kill them all.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.063
Warden, this is Surveillance.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.464
We got a full-scale riot.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.266

of his wife.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.803
Mr. Moss had
apparently undergone

41:46.805 --> 41:50.106
reconstructive surgery
to mirror the appearance

41:50.108 --> 41:53.943
of this man, Jace Corso,
a career criminal

41:53.945 --> 41:55.745
presently on the
Galactic Authority's

41:55.747 --> 41:57.747
Ten Most Wanted list.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.850
He a friend of yours?

42:02.254 --> 42:05.154
Yeah, he was.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.827
[WOMAN A] So they didn't
see it coming after all.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.061
And how did they react?

42:13.598 --> 42:15.064
I see.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.834
Well, uh, send flowers
and my condolences,

42:17.836 --> 42:20.803
and let me know when the
company goes into receivership.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.839
[chuckles]

42:22.841 --> 42:24.541
You know what?
I'm gonna have to go

42:24.543 --> 42:27.243
because Hughes is here with
some very good news for me.

42:27.245 --> 42:28.845
Okay, thanks.

42:29.915 --> 42:32.148
The crew of the
Raza escaped last night.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.284
And our asset?

42:34.286 --> 42:35.885
On board the ship with them.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.588
[WOMAN A]
Great.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.824
Now let's go get them.
