WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:09.710
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.614
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE AN HOUR AGO.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.317
I HAD IMPORTANT MEETINGS
WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.652
OKAY, I WENT SHOPPING.
ARE YOU HAPPY?

00:18.686 --> 00:21.222
SHOPPING?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.723
- IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.
- WHAT?

00:22.756 --> 00:25.326
YOUR CREDIT CARD CAUGHT ON
FIRE AND YOU HAD TO PUT IT OUT

00:25.359 --> 00:28.362
BY RUBBING THE MAGNETIC STRIP
BACK AND FORTH IN THAT THINGY?

00:28.396 --> 00:31.132
LOOK, MY FAMILY NEEDED SOME
SERIOUS RETAIL THERAPY.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.567
LAST NIGHT "20/20" RAN THAT
EMBARRASSING PIECE AGAIN

00:33.601 --> 00:36.036
ABOUT LENNOX AND RYDER'S
FATHER BEING A FUGITIVE.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.471
OH, IT WAS AWFUL.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.707
REALLY BAD.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.642
SO YOU'RE BUYING
THEIR PAIN AWAY?

00:41.675 --> 00:44.345
FOR THEM! IT'S ALL FOR THEM.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.680
EVERY BIT OF IT... OOH, EXCEPT
FOR THESE PEEP-TOE PUMPS.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.150
YEAH, THOSE ARE FOR ME.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.519
WHEN THE KIDS HURT, I HURT.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.789
- OH HEY, HI.
- HI.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.258
- HI.
- HI.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.493
YEAH, WE COVERED THAT.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.196
YOU GUYS ARE HOME... IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.233
BECAUSE I LIVE HERE
AND I HAVE KEYS.

01:07.235 --> 01:08.736
WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING THERE?

01:08.769 --> 01:11.572
WATER. JUST DRINKING WATER.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.275
FROM TWO GLASSES?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.744
I ENJOY WATER.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.680
THEY SAY IT'S TASTELESS,
BUT NOT TO ME.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.250
JOE! OH.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.285
OH, THERE'S THE OTHER
GLASS OF WATER.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.755
HI, I'M TESSA.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.056
- I'M MEL.
- RHONDA.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.091
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.660
- I'M JOE'S...
- COUSIN.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.730
DISTANT.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.732
OH, SO YOU'RE JUST HAVING A
FAMILY GET-TOGETHER DOWN THERE.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.435
YEP, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND IT'S
BEEN SO GREAT TO SEE YOU, TESSA, REALLY,

01:41.469 --> 01:44.405
BUT I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE SEVERAL OTHER
COUSINS TO SEE IN OTHER BASEMENTS.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.707
- OH, DON'T RUSH OUT ON MY ACCOUNT.
- NO NO NO, RUSH.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.842
IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.579
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, BYE-BYE.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.715
SO, COUSIN TESSA?

01:54.748 --> 01:57.318
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

01:57.351 --> 02:00.721
JOE, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE EMBARRASSED
ABOUT. WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.356
OKAY?

02:02.390 --> 02:05.226
I MEAN, IS SHE A GOOD KISSER?
DO YOU LOVE HER, HUH HUH HUH?

02:05.259 --> 02:08.095
DOES IT BOTHER YOU I WAS HAVING
SOMEBODY OVER HERE FOR LUNCH?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.331
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA WRITE
ME UP IN YOUR SLAM BOOK?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.834
- LIKE I HAVE A SLAM BOOK.
- IT'S MORE LIKE A BLOG.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.603
AH.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.672
LOOK, JOE, YOU CAN HAVE ANYBODY
YOU WANT OVER HERE FOR LUNCH,

02:18.706 --> 02:20.641
BUT JUST BE CAREFUL
WHERE YOU EAT IT.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.577
WE DON'T WANT THE KIDS WALKING
IN ON YOU WHILE YOU'RE "DINING."

02:25.613 --> 02:27.848
- DID YOU HAVE FUN WITH THAT?
- YEAH, I ACTUALLY DID.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.886
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:32.920 --> 02:34.788

RYDER, YOU GET ANY COMPLIMENTS
ON THE NEW BACKPACK I GOT YOU?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.431
TONS, 'CAUSE THAT'S
JUST WHAT DUDES DO.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.699
THEY ALSO SAID
THEY LIKED MY TOP.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.871
- YOU GUYS ARE REALLY CONNECTING.
- YEAH, I FELT THAT TOO.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.476
SO DID YOU PICK UP THE
POSTER BOARD FOR MY PROJECT?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.578
UH, NO, BUT I'M ON IT.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.915
HEY, DID YOU PICK UP THE POSTER
BOARD FOR LENNOX'S PROJECT?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.318
HELLO? JOE?

03:12.793 --> 03:15.429
I'M SORRY, ARE WE BACK TO
THE HIGH-SCHOOL THING?

03:15.463 --> 03:16.864
YEAH, DOES SHE GET ALL
SMOOCHY WHEN SHE WRITES?

03:16.897 --> 03:19.467
WOW, OKAY, NO HESITATION AT ALL

03:19.500 --> 03:21.735
JUST STICKING YOUR NOSE RIGHT
UP INTO MY PERSONAL BUSINESS.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.671
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT
GOING ON, YOU AND I.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.739
YEAH, IT'S PART OF
WHAT MAKES US US.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.608
I DON'T LIKE THAT PART.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.511
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.180
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
- LOOK...

03:33.213 --> 03:34.915
FINE, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.884
GOOD! GOOD FOR YOU.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.189

JOE, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

03:44.258 --> 03:47.261
- WHAT?
- UH, THAT THING FOR LENNOX.

03:47.295 --> 03:50.764
NO, I DIDN'T FORGET. I'M ON MY
WAY RIGHT NOW TO PICK UP, UM...

03:50.798 --> 03:52.400
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.202
YEAH, I DO. IT STARTS WITH...

03:55.235 --> 03:58.272
AN "S."

03:58.306 --> 04:01.842
- POSTER BOARD.
- S-SO MUCH POSTER BOARD.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.677
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.713
GOING TO GET A HUGE PILE OF
IT RIGHT NOW... HERE I GO.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.616
- ( rings )
- RIGHT AFTER I TAKE THIS. HELLO?

04:08.649 --> 04:10.784
YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.454
HEY HEY HEY, GET YOUR SHOES
OFF THE COFFEE TABLE.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.757
WAIT WAIT WAIT, GET YOUR SHOES
BACK ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.760
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AWESOME
NEW SNEAKERS I BOUGHT YOU?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.563
- UH, SNEAKERS?
- YEAH, THEY WERE LEATHER,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.732
VERY EXPENSIVE, YOU WORE
THEM TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.467
ANY OF THIS RINGING A BELL?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.736
YEAH, THE THING IS

04:28.769 --> 04:30.638
- I LOST THEM.
- HOW?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.640
THEY'RE TIED AND
KNOTTED TO YOUR FEET.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.743
I DON'T KNOW. THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
I GET DISTRACTED.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.778
WAIT WAIT WAIT. SIT.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.848
RELAX, COME ON. IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE
YOU AND I HAVE HAD A HEART TO HEART.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.750
WE'VE NEVER HAD A
HEART TO HEART.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.420
ALL RIGHT, THEN SCREW THAT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SHOES?

04:47.821 --> 04:50.758
LISTEN, YOU'D BETTER TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN ONE,

04:50.791 --> 04:53.661
TWO... THREE!

04:55.529 --> 04:56.797
ALL RIGHT, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED OR ELSE!

04:56.830 --> 04:59.433
OR ELSE WHAT? FOUR?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.669
OR ELSE I WILL COME
DOWN TO YOUR SCHOOL

05:01.702 --> 05:04.505
IN MY BATHROBE AND CRY...
UH-HUH!

05:04.538 --> 05:07.408
YEAH, MY MOTHER DID THAT ONCE.
TRUST ME, IT WORKS.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.610
SOMEBODY TOOK MY SNEAKERS, OKAY?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.713
PLEASE JUST DON'T GO ALL BATHROBE.
LET ME TAKE CARE OF IT.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.383
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE A SMART KID.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.418
YOU CAN TOTALLY HANDLE
THIS ON YOUR OWN.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.320
I NEED YOU TO SPY ON YOUR BROTHER TO
SEE WHO'S BULLYING HIM AT SCHOOL.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.690
SOMEONE'S BULLYING RYDER?

05:22.723 --> 05:26.494
- THAT'S MY JOB!
- JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, OKAY?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.095
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

05:28.128 --> 05:31.665
THE SENSE OF SATISFACTION THAT YOU'RE
DOING SOMETHING NICE FOR YOUR BROTHER?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.934
SERIOUSLY.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.738
- 20 BUCKS.
- ANYTHING FOR FAMILY.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.421
HERE'S ANOTHER LETTER FROM OUR FAVORITE
CONSTITUENT... MR. ANGRY RED CRAYON!

05:53.454 --> 05:56.990
I HEAR THAT THEY'RE KEEPING
HIM AWAY FROM SHARP OBJECTS.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.660
HEY, WHERE'S JOE AND WHY ISN'T
HE HERE MAKING US DINNER?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.830
OH, HE SAID HE HAD TO
GO MEET WITH TESSA.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.499
SOMEBODY SOUNDS A
LITTLE JELLY BEAN.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.736
WHAT, ARE WE IN THE FOURTH GRADE?
I AM SO NOT JELLY BEAN.

06:08.769 --> 06:12.339
I DON'T CARE WHAT JOE DOES WITH
TESSA OR WHERE JOE GOES WITH TESSA

06:12.372 --> 06:15.609
OR WHAT JOE DOES WITH TESSA...
OH MY GOSH, IT'S JOE AND TESSA!

06:15.643 --> 06:18.479
OH OH, DUCK OR THEY'LL THINK
WE'RE SPYING ON THEM.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.113
OKAY.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.750
THAT LOOKS LIKE A
REALLY CRAPPY DATE.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.385
I MEAN, WHO BRINGS FILE
FOLDERS TO A BOOTY CALL?

06:26.654 --> 06:28.922
YOU DON'T EVER PLAY SECRETARY?

06:28.956 --> 06:31.725
YEAH, BUT ALL YOU NEED
IS A PENCIL IN THE HAIR.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.963
OH MY GOSH, THEY'RE COMING IN!
ACT NORMAL... HIDE!

06:40.868 --> 06:43.771
I JUST DON'T WANT YOUR COUNCILWOMAN FRIEND
TO FIND US LIKE SHE DID THE OTHER DAY.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.639
- I CAN TOTALLY HANDLE HER.
- OH?

06:45.673 --> 06:47.708
- SHH.
- CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.844
SURE. SO DO YOU REALLY HAVE A
CONTACT AT THE BANK OF DUBAI?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.746
YES I DO AND HE WILL
DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.715
- YOU JUST NEED TO HELP ME DRAFT THAT EMAIL.
- M'KAY.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.452
- AND YOU'RE SURE YOUR BOSS IS NOT SUSPICIOUS AT ALL?
- OF COURSE NOT.

06:58.486 --> 07:01.589
TECHNICALLY SHE'S NOT MY BOSS.
I'M FREELANCE.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.093
OH. HOLY CRAP.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.662
HOW DO POLE DANCERS DO THAT?

07:10.731 --> 07:14.735
CONSTANT WORKOUTS... THE MAIN
REASON I SWITCHED TO POLITICS.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.804
THOUGH IT'S KIND
OF A LATERAL MOVE.

07:16.837 --> 07:20.741
BANK OF DUBAI? WHAT IN THE
HECK IS GOING ON DOWN THERE?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.076
SOUNDS LIKE JOE'S INVOLVED
IN SOME KIND OF SHADY DEAL.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.779
- MY JOE?
- HE DID WORK FOR LEWIS SCANLON.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.848
YEAH, BUT HE WAS DUPED.
HE LOST EVERYTHING.

07:27.881 --> 07:32.419
DESPERATE MEN WILL DO DESPERATE THINGS...
LIKE BECOME YOUR NANNY.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.523
YOU DID A THOROUGH BACKGROUND CHECK
ON JOE BEFORE YOU HIRED HIM, RIGHT?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.591
FINGERPRINTS, F.B.I.?

07:37.625 --> 07:41.662
I CHECKED HIS FACEBOOK PAGE
AND HIS NETFLIX QUEUE.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.632
I MEAN THE GUY WAS WAITING
FOR "MARLEY & ME."

07:44.665 --> 07:47.200
MEL, YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.972
THIS IS GONNA BE SO UNPLEASANT.

07:52.005 --> 07:55.709
WITH ANY LUCK YOU'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND THEY'LL JUST BE HAVING SEX.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.711
FINGERS CROSSED.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.882
SO IF THESE ASSETS WERE LAST
SEEN GOING THROUGH ABU DHABI,

08:01.915 --> 08:04.752
- THEY WOULD NEXT SHOW UP WHERE?
- Mel: KNOCK KNOCK!

08:04.785 --> 08:06.754
COMING THROUGH. DON'T MIND ME.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.623
JUST DOING A LITTLE
LAUNDRY HERE.

08:09.657 --> 08:13.927
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU DO LAUNDRY?
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE A GIANT MAP ON YOUR WALL?

08:13.961 --> 08:17.497
WOW, IT LOOKS LIKE SOME
SORT OF GEOGRAPHY LESSON,

08:17.531 --> 08:20.868
WITH PINS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
AND PHOTOS AND ARTICLES

08:20.901 --> 08:24.071
ABOUT LEWIS SCANLON.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.641
- WE'RE ON A DATE.
- REALLY?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.777
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ON
SOME SORT OF A MANHUNT.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.112
OH MY GOD, ARE YOU ON
SOME SORT OF A MANHUNT?!

08:32.145 --> 08:34.548
FINE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR LEWIS.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.684
AND WE ARE THIS CLOSE
TO FINDING HIM.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.118
UH-HUH, SO THE FEDS ARE STUMPED,

08:38.151 --> 08:40.520
BUT YOU AND YOUR BOND GIRL
ARE GOING TO CRACK THE CASE

08:40.554 --> 08:42.255
FROM DOWN HERE NEXT
TO MY WATER HEATER?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.658
WE KNOW HOW LEWIS THINKS.
WE BOTH WORKED FOR HIM.

08:44.692 --> 08:48.228
- TESSA LOST EVERYTHING TOO.
- MY KIDS HAD TO SWITCH TO PUBLIC SCHOOL!

08:48.261 --> 08:50.197
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE!

08:50.230 --> 08:53.000
I MEAN, NOT ABOUT THE SCHOOLS
BECAUSE THEY'VE REALLY IMPROVED...

08:53.033 --> 08:55.903
SMALLER CLASS SIZES,
STATE-OF-THE-ART METAL DETECTORS.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.640
THREE DAYS AGO TESSA CALLED ME AND
SAID THAT LEWIS WAS SPOTTED IN DUBAI.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.609
LOOK AT THIS. SEE THIS PICTURE?

09:01.642 --> 09:04.011
IT'S A LITTLE BIT GRAINY, BUT
THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.714
OH YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND
LOOK WHO'S THERE NEXT TO HIM.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.281
IT'S ELVIS!

09:10.117 --> 09:11.952
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.822
YEAH, I SHOULD GO. YOU
HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.725
THANKS. I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD
OF THE SITUATION ROOM.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.163
- I'LL CALL YOU LATER!
- FROM A SECURE LINE!

09:23.196 --> 09:25.699
- BEFORE YOU START, LET ME JUST SAY...
- WHAT, LIE AGAIN?

09:25.733 --> 09:28.769
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN LIE?
- YOU LIED TO ME. YOU SAID SHE WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.072
NO, YOU SAID SHE WAS MY GIRLFRIEND AND
I AGREED WITH YOU, SO TECHNICALLY...

09:32.105 --> 09:33.807
YOU LIED TO YOU.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.977
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE ALL YOUR
DIFFERENT STATEMENTS AND LINE THEM UP

09:37.010 --> 09:39.847
ON A COLOR-CODED MAP ON A WALL AND
SEE IF WE CAN LOCATE THE TRUTH.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.249
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.185
DID YOU REALLY EVER WANT
TO SEE "MARLEY & ME"?

09:45.218 --> 09:48.321
WHA... I... I LIKE OWEN
WILSON, ALL RIGHT?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.590
AND JENNIFER ANISTON
IS VERY SWEET.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.693
I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S SWEET, OKAY?
I'M SWEET TOO!

09:52.726 --> 09:54.695
AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF MY SWEET NATURE.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.698
( gasps ) DID YOU EMBED
YOURSELF IN MY HOUSE TO LOOK

09:57.731 --> 10:00.033
FOR LEWIS UNDER THE GUISE
OF BEING MY NANNY?

10:00.067 --> 10:02.335
WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS? THIS
STARTED THREE DAYS AGO.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.738
- SO YOU SAY.
- I SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF MY OWN TIME

10:04.772 --> 10:07.975
TRYING TO TRACK DOWN THIS SCHMUCK SO I COULD
BRING HIM TO JUSTICE SO HE CAN CLEAR MY NAME.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.643
I THINK THAT'S WORTH
A FEW LUNCH HOURS.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.745
IT'S MORE THAN JUST
LUNCH HOURS, JOE.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.614
IT'S CREEPING INTO ALL THE HOURS.
IT'S TAKING OVER.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.249
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
I'M NOT DOING MY JOB?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.218
I'M MOMENTS AWAY FROM SAYING IT.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.888
OOP... AND HERE IT COMES.
YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB!

10:20.921 --> 10:23.023
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.325
YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT A
BULLY TOOK RYDER'S SNEAKERS.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.260
I TOTALLY KNEW THAT...
WAIT, WHAT?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.697
- I THOUGHT HE LOST THEM.
- PAY ATTENTION, OKAY?!

10:29.730 --> 10:32.065
SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS ARE
HAPPENING RIGHT ABOVE YOUR HEAD

10:32.099 --> 10:35.068
WHILE YOU'RE DOWN HERE
PLAYING "WHERE'S WALDO?"

10:35.102 --> 10:38.806
UGH. WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST HAVE
BEEN HAVING SEX WITH YOUR COUSIN?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.915
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.051
- WANT SOME BREAKFAST?
- BREAKFAST?

10:51.084 --> 10:55.756
INTERESTING COVER, JOE.
IF IT IS IN FACT "JOE."

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
( grunts )

11:07.835 --> 11:09.770
YEP, OKAY.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.812
- ( clears throat )
- HEY, WHAT... WHAT...

11:20.447 --> 11:22.082
THAT WAS... ( groans )

11:36.997 --> 11:40.801
- WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST?
- ( unison ) CEREAL.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.737
SO QUICK, BEFORE HE COMES DOWN... DID
YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT RYDER?

11:43.771 --> 11:46.239
HE'S TRYING OUT FOR CHEERLEADER.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.911
- REALLY?
- WELL, I SIGNED HIM UP.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.914
OKAY, FOCUS, LENNOX. DID
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.716
OH YEAH, HUGE!

11:56.750 --> 11:59.052
SO TAMMY LeBONGE SAID SHE
WAS OUT SICK WITH MONO,

11:59.086 --> 12:01.454
BUT I COULD TOTALLY TELL
SHE GOT A NOSE JOB.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.291
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TRY
TALKING TO HIM, ALL RIGHT?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.759
SORT OF A LITTLE MAN-TO-MAN THING.
HERE.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.962
GOSH, CAN YOU HANDLE IT, WITH
YOUR BASEMENT MISSION AND ALL?

12:08.996 --> 12:12.833
DON'T LET THE BAD GUYS GET AWAY 'CAUSE
THE FREE WORLD IS COUNTING ON YOU.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.337
AH, SARCASM... IT'S REALLY
PART OF A COMPLETE BREAKFAST.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.308
YO, WHAT'S UP, MAN? YOU READY?

12:21.341 --> 12:24.744
- WHERE'S YOUR BACKPACK?
- UH, I KINDA LOST IT.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.215
YOU LOST IT? THE SAME WAY
THAT YOU LOST YOUR SHOES?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.017
- WHEN?
- A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.452
COME ON, JOE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SHOW UP IN YOUR BATHROBE

12:32.485 --> 12:34.387
AND MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT
OF THIS TOO, ARE YOU?

12:36.890 --> 12:40.193
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE IT.
- HEY, RYDER, YOU FORGOT YOUR NOTEBOOK.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.030
- HEY, WHERE'S YOUR NEW BACKPACK?
- IN THE WASHING MACHINE.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.098
I KNOW, IT'S BRAND NEW
AND ALREADY FILTHY.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.500
SEE, THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T
HAVE NICE THINGS. LET'S GO.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.773
BURKE, YOU ARE GONNA LOVE ME.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.276
WHY, ARE YOU SUDDENLY
MADE OF COOKIE DOUGH?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.013
ALL RIGHT, FINE. YOU'RE
GONNA LOVE WHAT I DID.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.482
HEY, RYDER, I GOT YOUR
SHOES BACK, BUDDY.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.217
YOU DID? HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

13:04.251 --> 13:07.287
BACK TO THE BASICS... GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
STAKEOUT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.190
15 MINUTES IN, I RAN INTO THE KID
WEARING THESE, WENT UP TO HIM...

13:10.223 --> 13:12.392
OF COURSE HE DENIED IT. IT
ALMOST GOT A LITTLE UGLY,

13:12.425 --> 13:15.896
BUT I CAN BE KIND OF
INTIMIDATING WHEN I WANT TO BE.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.299
OOH YEAH, VERY SCARY. ESPECIALLY
WITH THOSE LONG EYELASHES.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.534
I'M ALSO WORKING ON
GETTING HIS BACKPACK TOO.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.770
BACKPACK! YOU SAID
IT WAS IN THE WASH.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.973
THIS TIME I INTENTIONALLY
DID NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

13:26.006 --> 13:28.842
- BUT THAT WAS ONLY SO THAT YOU WOULD TRUST ME.- OH, SO TO WIN MY TRUST BACK

13:28.876 --> 13:30.277
- YOU LIED?
- YES, I LIED.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.811
BUT THAT'S THE TRUTH.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.815
HEY, HERE YOU GO, BUDDY.
SWEET! CHECK IT OUT.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.051
- WHERE'D THESE COME FROM?
- YOU DON'T NEED TO THANK ME.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.153
- NO, BUT...
- JUST GO PUT THEM ON. GO AHEAD.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.055
GO!

13:42.089 --> 13:44.157
YOU, HOWEVER, NEED TO THANK ME.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.894
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
HOW I WOULD HAVE DONE IT,

13:46.927 --> 13:49.162
AND IT WAS KIND OF CRAZY AND
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY ASKED YOU TO...

13:49.196 --> 13:52.365
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY AWFUL AT THIS
COMPLIMENTING-PEOPLE STUFF, AREN'T YOU?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.801
THANK YOU, JOE. YOU REALLY
CAME THROUGH THIS TIME.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.603
YES, I DID. I JUST
MADE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.540
THESE AREN'T MY SNEAKERS.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.344
OF COURSE THEY ARE. I JUST
MADE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.579
EXCEPT THIS TIME. THESE
ARE SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.516
GOOD GOING, JOE.
YOU MUGGED A KID.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.119
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE, NO.
HE WAS A BULLY.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.520
I MEAN, 6' TALL,

14:13.553 --> 14:16.256
KIND OF HEAVYSET, 3:00 SHADOW.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.091
BRANDON MALANSKY?!

14:18.125 --> 14:21.061
TERRIFIC. HE'S A SENIOR...
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.964
EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ONLINE
AND CHANGE MY STATUS TO DEAD.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.501
YOU KNOW, I THINK I
KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.571
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AFTER RYDER, YOU
WERE TOO BUSY LOOKING FOR HIS FATHER.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.041
YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED.
YOU'RE DISTRACTED.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.643
- I AM NOT!
- ( phone ringing )

14:37.877 --> 14:39.479
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:39.512 --> 14:42.149
I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE.
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA GET THIS.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.117
SEE, OVER IT. NOT ANSWERING IT.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.623
- ( whistles )
- IT'S TESSA.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.225
I GOTTA TAKE THAT. I'M SORRY.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.927
HELLO? YES!

15:02.235 --> 15:05.338
TESSA, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN. ARE
YOU SURE THAT HE'S IN BAHRAIN?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.474
DAMN IT, HOW IS LEWIS
MOVING SO FAST?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.209
HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.579
IT'S HIM. NO, NOT LEWIS.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.547
THE KID THAT TOOK
RYDER'S BACKPACK.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.616
LISTEN, I HAVE TO CALL YOU
RIGHT BACK, OKAY? BYE.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.988
( phone rings )

15:21.021 --> 15:24.591
- WHAT IS IT, LONGO?
- I THINK I JUST FOUND OUR BULLY.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.193
OH, WELL, DO ME A LITTLE FAVOR

15:26.226 --> 15:28.428
AND MEASURE HIS SHOE SIZE
BEFORE YOU TAZE HIM?

15:28.461 --> 15:31.464
I'm serious. He's out in the driveway.
I need you to take a look.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.968
- See that kid?
- OH YEAH.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.304
THAT'S RYDER'S BACKPACK. IT'S
GOT THAT REFLECTIVE STRIPE.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.639
- OH, LET'S GET HIM.
- YEP... ( grunts )

15:39.672 --> 15:41.241
OH, SORRY. OH WOW.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.443
THAT'S... HARD. WHAT
DO YOU GOT IN THERE?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.478
I WORK OUT.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.647
YEAH WELL, YOU CAN STOP,
'CAUSE YOU'RE DONE.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.583
- LET'S GO TAKE HIM DOWN!
- HOLD ON, HOLD ON A MINUTE, TRAINING DAY.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.287
- THERE'S A LOT OF BACKPACKS THAT LOOK JUST LIKE THAT.
- BUT HE'S GOT RYDER'S SNEAKERS.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.289
THERE'S A LOT OF SNEAKERS
THAT LOOK JUST LIKE THAT TOO.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.591
THIS IS ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL UNTIL
WE SEE SOME ACTUAL BULLYING.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.429
SO YOU JUST WANT TO SIT UP HERE AND WAIT
UNTIL RYDER'S DOWN TO HIS TIGHTY-WHITEYS?

16:02.462 --> 16:05.265
YOU WANT TO LOSE THE COLLAR, GO AHEAD.
I'M PLAYING THIS ONE BY THE BOOK.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.671
RYDER JUST GAVE THE KID THE SCOOTER.
MOVE IT, MOVE IT.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.573
- OH, OKAY. OH WAIT!
- WHAT?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.675
SO WHEN I WANTED TO
GO WITH THE SNEAKERS

16:15.708 --> 16:17.544
AND THE BACKPACK,
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.612
BUT NOW THERE'S A SCOOTER,
SO NOW WE CAN GO?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.514
- YEAH.
- 'KAY.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.183
- ALL RIGHT, MOVE IT.
- I NEED SHOES.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.518
FORGET THE SHOES. THERE'S NO
TIME FOR SHOES. LET'S GO.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.491
( clears throat ) WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE, FELLAS?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.660
- NOTHING.
- SURE.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.463
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MR.
NOTHING-DOER?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.432
- UH, I'M ISAAC.
- HE'S MY FRIEND FROM SCHOOL.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.669
AH, DID YOU HEAR THAT, JOE?
HIS FRIEND FROM SCHOOL ISAAC.

16:42.702 --> 16:47.040
- YEAH, FRIEND.
- ( disbelieving laughs )

16:47.074 --> 16:49.376
MIND IF I ASK YOUR FRIEND
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.380
YOU HAVE VERY LONG
EYELASHES, SIR.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.517
THANK YOU. DID YOU
HEAR WHAT HE JUST...

16:57.550 --> 16:59.152
ALL RIGHT, CUT THE CRAP, ISAAC.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.189
- WHERE'D YOU GET THE BACKPACK?
- I GOT IT FROM RYDER.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.724
RYDER, HUH? WHAT
ABOUT THE SNEAKERS?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.427
- RYDER.
- RYDER! WE SEEING A PATTERN HERE, BURKE?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.163
YEAH, LONGO, I'M SEEING A PATTERN.
BIG PATTERN.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.300
- LISTEN, I CAN EXPLAIN.
- I THINK I GET IT.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.135
- OH YOU GET IT.
- YEAH.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.205
LISTEN, KID, YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE
STUFF THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU

17:18.238 --> 17:20.640
AND LEAVE AN INNOCENT PERSON
WITH NO BACKPACK, NO SNEAKERS,

17:20.673 --> 17:22.675
NO JOB, NO MONEY, NO PORSCHE.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.677
- YOU SICK...
- JOE, NOT ABOUT YOU.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.780
RIGHT. THE JIG'S UP, KID.
YOU'RE BUSTED.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.649
TAKE IT OFF, LET'S GO.
EVERYTHING.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.484
- HERE, TAKE IT. TAKE IT ALL.
- UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.553
- AND THE SHOES. GO, GET OUT OF HERE!
- YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY!

17:33.586 --> 17:35.088
NO NO, ISAAC, I'M SORRY!

17:35.122 --> 17:37.657
- THANKS A LOT!
- WHAT ARE YOU MAD AT US FOR?

17:37.690 --> 17:40.793
- HE JUST TOOK ALL YOUR STUFF.
- NO, HE DIDN'T. I GAVE IT TO HIM.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.164
ISAAC'S PARENTS INVESTED THEIR
LIFE'S SAVINGS WITH MY DAD.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.800
THEN HE RUNS OFF WITH EVERYTHING AND
RUINS THEIR LIVES. THANKS A LOT!

17:50.370 --> 17:53.373
I THINK WE JUST PLAYED
BAD COP-WORSE COP.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.377
YOU'RE WORSE COP. I ONLY BULLIED
ONE INNOCENT KID. YOU BULLIED TWO.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.680
I JUST DUG MYSELF A
PRETTY BIG HOLE HERE.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.283
MIND IF I GO TAKE A
SHOT AT TALKING TO HIM?

18:03.316 --> 18:07.086
GO FOR IT. I'M GONNA TRY TO
CATCH ISAAC AND APOLOGIZE.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.423
THAT SHOULDN'T BE HARD. THE
KID DOESN'T HAVE ANY SHOES.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.425
NEITHER DO I.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.462
HERE, JUST USE THESE.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.132
( knocks )

18:19.166 --> 18:21.501
HEY.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.536
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:23.570 --> 18:26.606
- GIVING ALL MY STUFF TO ISAAC.
- REALLY?

18:26.639 --> 18:29.742
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER TO LEAVE ALL
YOUR STUFF HERE AND LET ISAAC MOVE IN?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.746
GIVING AWAY YOUR STUFF
IS VERY GENEROUS, MAN,

18:33.780 --> 18:35.715
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA FIX
THE MESS YOUR DAD MADE.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.718
- THEN WHO IS GONNA FIX IT?
- HOPEFULLY YOUR DAD WILL.

18:38.751 --> 18:42.622
MAYBE NOBODY'LL FIX IT. YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES THINGS DON'T GET FIXED.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.692
SO MY DAD JUST GETS AWAY WITH IT?
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.195
AREN'T YOU MAD AT HIM?

18:48.228 --> 18:51.664
AM I MAD? I NICKNAMED
MY ULCER "LEWIS."

18:53.800 --> 18:57.704
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.707
THIS WHOLE THING IS CONSUMING YOU.
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO GET PAST IT.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.676
- HOW?
- HOW? I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.547
I HAVE NO IDEA.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.850
BUT I DON'T THINK GIVING
AWAY YOUR BASKETBALL

19:10.883 --> 19:12.652
IS GOING TO MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.524
- I REALLY LIKE THAT BASKETBALL.
- THEN YOU SHOULD KEEP IT.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.593
- JUST MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.232
ACTUALLY IT'S NOT.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.901
AS HARD AS IT IS FOR YOU, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO LET THIS THING GO.

19:30.337 --> 19:33.473
DO ME A FAVOR: JUST
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.708
PUT ALL THIS STUFF BACK
AND I PROMISE YOU...

19:35.742 --> 19:38.845
TOMORROW WILL BE A LITTLE BIT
BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY.

19:40.947 --> 19:44.684
TRUST ME, THERE ARE MANY MORE FUN AND INTERESTING
THINGS OUT THERE TO GET OBSESSED ABOUT,

19:44.717 --> 19:48.755
LIKE SPORTS, VIDEO GAMES.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.525
- AND SEX?
- ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.730
HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE ALL
YOUR STUFF AWAY THERE EITHER.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.599
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.469
YEAH, YOU'LL BE THE ONE
GUY THAT GETS OUT ALIVE.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.382
- HEY, HOW DID IT GO UP THERE?
- IT WENT WELL.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.717
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY
GOTTEN THROUGH TO HIM.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.720
WELL, THAT'S VERY
IMPRESSIVE, JOE,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.789
ESPECIALLY THE PART
ABOUT LETTING GO.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.392
OH, THANK... WERE
YOU SPYING ON ME?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.193
NO, I WOULD NEVER... OKAY YEAH.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.663
- PFFFT.
- LOOK, I HAD TO LIE TO REBUILD OUR TRUST.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.965
WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT BEFORE?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.901
( phone rings )

20:34.934 --> 20:39.272
- IT'S TESSA.
- AREN'T YOU GONNA TAKE IT?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.841
NO. NO I'M NOT.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.445
I'M OFF THE CASE. I GOT A LOT OF
STUFF GOING ON HERE, YOU KNOW?

20:47.614 --> 20:50.750
- I'M GOING TO MEET PHOEBE AT THE MALL.
- OH, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.485
