WEBVTT

00:03.743 --> 00:05.150
I wish we'd met

00:05.651 --> 00:06.921
years ago.

00:13.144 --> 00:14.593
I'm not interested in you.

00:14.594 --> 00:16.803
Yeah, well, I don't believe
that and neither do you.

00:16.804 --> 00:19.283
Tara lost her family in the 2015 quake.

00:19.284 --> 00:21.443
You set your mind to
anything, you'd smash it.

00:21.444 --> 00:23.553
Be a lawyer, Prime Minister even!

00:23.554 --> 00:24.673
In UK?

00:24.674 --> 00:25.993
Maya, where is she? Where's Tara?

00:25.994 --> 00:27.303
- She's gone.
- Gone?

00:27.304 --> 00:28.753
She wants to go to UK.

01:09.074 --> 01:10.193
Captain Azizi!

01:12.074 --> 01:13.803
Hey.

01:13.804 --> 01:15.863
Good to see you, my
friend. You look well.

01:15.864 --> 01:17.083
Old.

01:19.574 --> 01:20.933
They didn't tell me it was you.

01:22.294 --> 01:24.493
Why would they? Is this the truck?

01:27.544 --> 01:29.553
I thought it'd be more like the films.

01:29.554 --> 01:33.353
- The films?
- What, so you thought it would be more exciting?

01:33.354 --> 01:34.763
Maybe.

01:34.764 --> 01:36.583
Haven't been here before, have I?

01:36.584 --> 01:39.303
Trust me, excitement is the
last thing you want here.

01:39.304 --> 01:40.763
Guys, less chat.

01:40.764 --> 01:43.803
All right, guys, the ANA will
take us from here to the base

01:43.804 --> 01:45.633
where we'll rendezvous with the SF.

01:45.674 --> 01:48.163
Ooh, bring on the real men.

01:50.184 --> 01:51.543
Steady on, Richards.

01:58.574 --> 01:59.933
You worked with blades before, then?

01:59.934 --> 02:01.293
Yeah.

02:01.294 --> 02:04.853
That Elvis one seconded me and
Lane for a rescue job in Syria.

02:04.854 --> 02:08.323
Let's just say the action
continued into decompression.

02:10.484 --> 02:11.843
You and Elvis?

02:11.844 --> 02:14.133
Yeah, I mean, he's a bit full of himself

02:14.174 --> 02:16.103
- but you can't deny that body.
- Hey.

02:17.934 --> 02:19.853
- What?
- Shh.

02:19.854 --> 02:21.963
Is he riddled with something?

02:21.964 --> 02:24.213
Not exactly. He was engaged to Georgie.

02:24.214 --> 02:26.260
Yes, ages ago.

02:26.261 --> 02:27.823
We're just friends now.

02:30.924 --> 02:32.603
What kind of a name is Elvis anyway?

03:03.314 --> 03:05.753
What is that smell?

03:05.754 --> 03:07.293
I thought it was you.

03:07.294 --> 03:11.093
Eau de Kabul, that, mate.
Breathe it in, my friend.

03:25.014 --> 03:26.193
Over there.

03:29.424 --> 03:32.373
Thought you and your brothers
weren't allowed so much as a beer.

03:32.374 --> 03:34.023
They're not.

03:34.024 --> 03:36.593
It is a product of the conflict.

03:36.594 --> 03:38.663
The allies needed help
to fight the Taliban

03:38.664 --> 03:40.863
so they turned to the warlords.

03:40.864 --> 03:44.663
They wanted to grow the poppy,
the Taliban used to forbid it.

03:44.664 --> 03:46.023
So what changed?

03:46.024 --> 03:47.843
Taliban were skint after the war,

03:47.844 --> 03:49.813
they had to make their
money back somehow.

03:49.814 --> 03:52.023
Heroin is now our largest export.

04:09.174 --> 04:10.863
Get the driver to step on it, please.

04:10.864 --> 04:12.363
We're nearly there.

04:12.364 --> 04:13.963
Is everything all right, boss?

04:25.024 --> 04:26.803
Incoming, get down!

04:29.944 --> 04:33.793
- Contact left. Has anybody got eyes on?
- Nothing seen, boss.

04:33.794 --> 04:34.963
No one else, boss.

04:34.964 --> 04:36.743
Get us into base, now!

04:41.244 --> 04:42.743
Keep your heads down, guys.

05:01.874 --> 05:03.793
No... Unless you want him to die,

05:03.794 --> 05:06.133
you're going to have to
accept a little female help.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.743
He's got an entry but not
exit wound upper right chest.

05:17.954 --> 05:20.993
No, let him stay. He
might learn something.

05:25.024 --> 05:28.163
Right, guys, on me. Is everyone OK?

05:28.164 --> 05:30.563
- Boss.
- All right, Kalil? You look a little pasty.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.963
I'm fine, boss.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.423
Welcome to Afghanistan.

06:14.014 --> 06:16.033
Your face when they started shooting.

06:16.034 --> 06:17.813
Reckon he's got proper skidders.

06:17.814 --> 06:19.403
I thought we were here as support.

06:19.404 --> 06:21.793
Didn't expect to be shot
at the minute we arrived.

06:21.794 --> 06:24.703
Afghan popped your cherry, mate.
First live fire and all that.

06:24.704 --> 06:27.183
Don't worry, mate, we all
shit ourselves the first time.

06:27.184 --> 06:30.753
I didn't shit myself!
No skidders neither.

06:30.754 --> 06:32.623
Hi, guys.

06:32.624 --> 06:34.543
- All right, boss.
- Boss.

06:39.054 --> 06:40.593
Nice work, Lane.

06:40.594 --> 06:42.983
He appreciates what you
did for him, as do I.

06:44.254 --> 06:45.983
Not sure everyone feels like that.

06:45.984 --> 06:49.173
Malik is not a bad soldier.

06:49.174 --> 06:50.763
He needs to learn when to accept help.

06:50.764 --> 06:52.173
He's frustrated.

06:52.174 --> 06:54.703
He comes here to fight
to make his country better

06:54.704 --> 06:56.953
and what does he find?

06:56.954 --> 07:01.553
Poor training, poor equipment.
Would you want that for your men?

07:01.554 --> 07:02.913
No.

07:02.914 --> 07:06.903
Lane, did I ever tell you
how Captain Azizi and I met?

07:06.904 --> 07:09.993
- No.
- Helmand Province, 2014.

07:09.994 --> 07:13.513
We bonded over a
shared love of The Boss.

07:13.514 --> 07:15.763
Captain Azizi, here,
can't get enough of him.

07:15.764 --> 07:18.713
His old man music is not for me.

07:18.714 --> 07:20.683
Drum and bass all the way.

07:22.564 --> 07:24.203
Is it really three years?

07:24.204 --> 07:25.603
It's a long time as allies.

07:27.294 --> 07:28.373
One question, though.

07:28.374 --> 07:29.683
What's The Boss?

07:29.684 --> 07:31.513
Come on! Are you
going to make me sing it?

07:31.514 --> 07:33.623
- No, no, no...
- It's Bruce Springsteen.

07:33.624 --> 07:36.063
Captain Azizi, new
intel on Omar just in,

07:36.064 --> 07:37.463
ready to brief in ten.

07:37.464 --> 07:39.013
- I'll gather my men.
- Thank you.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.233
Heard you had a bumpy ride in.

07:43.234 --> 07:46.563
Nothing we can't handle. When
are you heading out to recce?

07:46.564 --> 07:48.393
Last light.

07:48.394 --> 07:50.733
Well... try and keep
yourself in one piece.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.093
I'll do my best.

07:58.464 --> 07:59.783
All good with you and Lane?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.203
Yeah, we're grown ups with a job to do.

08:05.594 --> 08:06.713
Glad to hear it.

08:08.214 --> 08:10.933
Now let's make sure the same
can be said for over there.

08:13.654 --> 08:14.923
Shit.

08:17.454 --> 08:18.863
How did you know about that anyway?

08:18.864 --> 08:21.813
You were mentioned in dispatches.

08:21.814 --> 08:24.813
OK, did Georgie happen to be
present during these dispatches?

08:24.814 --> 08:27.343
That's not a problem, is it?

08:27.344 --> 08:29.033
I thought you were "just friends" now?

08:31.144 --> 08:34.703
Georgie and I will never just be
friends, Charlie, you know that.

08:34.703 --> 08:38.553
You want my advice, deal with
one emotional minefield at a time,

08:38.554 --> 08:40.803
- starting there.
- Yeah.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.303
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.703
Da Chand led MI6 straight
to Omar's compound

08:49.704 --> 08:51.623
in Nahri Saraj, Helmand Province.

08:51.624 --> 08:55.143
Taliban insurgents have significant
influence across the whole region.

08:55.144 --> 08:57.393
And Omar's compound's smack
bang in the middle of it.

08:57.394 --> 08:59.503
And his men have eyes everywhere,

08:59.504 --> 09:02.413
so it's imperative that
we stay under the radar.

09:02.414 --> 09:05.733
Our primary advantage here
is the element of surprise.

09:05.734 --> 09:08.693
Using the ANA trucks as
cover, we'll move to this FOB,

09:08.694 --> 09:10.613
prepare to support the
assault on the ground.

09:10.614 --> 09:13.893
Once we have achieved our objective,
we will extract immediately.

09:13.894 --> 09:16.993
Now, we've all seen
what Omar is capable of.

09:17.034 --> 09:20.693
I don't want anybody going into
this thinking it's going to be easy.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.850
It's a fourhour walk from
the FOB to the compound

09:22.854 --> 09:26.643
over difficult terrain,
so rest up as best you can.

09:26.644 --> 09:30.253
Prepare to receive a more detailed
brief once we reach the FOB.

09:30.254 --> 09:31.523
Any questions?

09:31.524 --> 09:32.923
- Boss.
- No, boss.

09:32.924 --> 09:35.693
Sir, what about Da Chand?

09:36.864 --> 09:38.643
If anything were to happen to Da Chand,

09:38.644 --> 09:40.473
it would immediately arouse suspicion.

09:40.474 --> 09:42.443
So, we're basically just letting him go?

09:42.444 --> 09:44.933
Would you rather we compromise
this mission, Richards?

09:44.934 --> 09:46.853
Well, no, obviously not, but I mean...

09:46.854 --> 09:48.163
Come on, he sells kids for money,

09:48.164 --> 09:50.083
he doesn't give a toss
about where they end up...

09:50.084 --> 09:54.303
Private Richards, this
mission is not about Da Chand.

09:54.304 --> 09:55.663
Is that understood?

09:57.724 --> 09:58.803
Sorry, boss.

10:02.974 --> 10:04.573
Start line 0600.

10:04.574 --> 10:05.693
Boss.

10:15.964 --> 10:18.443
Right, I think we can live
without the sound effects.

10:18.444 --> 10:19.423
Thank you, Brains.

10:19.424 --> 10:21.224
- I'm just trying to make it realistic.
- Shh!

10:22.804 --> 10:26.133
OK, so direct pressure
to the wound, yeah?

10:26.134 --> 10:27.683
Pushing down.

10:27.684 --> 10:29.833
Then, if possible...

10:29.834 --> 10:33.683
you elevate the limb, like so,

10:33.684 --> 10:36.773
and apply blast bandage like
I showed you earlier. Yeah?

10:36.774 --> 10:38.183
OK, go on.

10:41.094 --> 10:42.493
Her conviction is admirable.

10:43.244 --> 10:45.913
No one likes to see their
fellow comrades suffering.

10:48.354 --> 10:51.823
Forgive me, it's been a long war.

10:53.134 --> 10:54.733
And then you come down...

10:54.734 --> 10:55.993
tight.

10:55.994 --> 10:57.213
We'll get there.

11:06.684 --> 11:08.743
Is it Tara?

11:08.744 --> 11:10.343
It's bloody Domino's.

11:10.344 --> 11:13.813
Don't. I could just go an
18inch stuffed crust Hawaiian.

11:13.814 --> 11:16.063
Pervert! Who puts
pineapple on a pizza?

11:17.654 --> 11:18.963
I'm out.

11:18.964 --> 11:20.703
Me too.

11:25.854 --> 11:27.823
Now, you're bluffing.

11:27.824 --> 11:29.423
Am I now, Monk?

11:29.424 --> 11:30.963
Yeah, better luck next time, mate.

11:32.894 --> 11:34.623
Decent.

11:34.624 --> 11:35.983
Snake!

11:35.984 --> 11:37.953
It's a tough shift, that.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.873
Yeah, could teach you
lot a thing or two.

11:39.924 --> 11:41.700
Why do they bothering
cleaning the carpets anyway?

11:41.701 --> 11:42.851
It's a dust bowl out there.

11:43.184 --> 11:45.363
They're prayer mats, you muppet.

11:46.764 --> 11:49.393
Maisie, come here, I'll press you.

11:49.394 --> 11:51.313
Yeah, yeah, shh, shh!

11:51.314 --> 11:53.043
Yeah, all right. Go on, then.

11:58.444 --> 12:00.973
- Go on, Rab, you got this.
- Go on, push it. Keep going.

12:00.974 --> 12:03.503
- Keep going.
- Dig in. Dig in. Come on.

12:09.024 --> 12:11.653
- Bellend!
- Come on.

12:11.654 --> 12:14.703
Omar's going to be shitting
it when he sees you coming,

12:14.704 --> 12:16.113
isn't he, big lad?

12:16.114 --> 12:17.233
Richards...

12:18.364 --> 12:19.813
- can I have a word?
- Yeah.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.113
Sassy.

12:23.474 --> 12:26.093
Why is my man scooping
everything, Maisie, Georgie?

12:26.094 --> 12:27.503
Kingy.

12:27.504 --> 12:30.223
Yeah, right. Yeah, good one.

12:31.674 --> 12:34.063
All right, you two.

12:34.064 --> 12:36.231
- Yeah, we were just...
- I'm going to try and get some kip.

12:36.232 --> 12:38.193
- See you later.
- Yeah...

12:42.274 --> 12:43.850
Do you mind if we go
somewhere a bit quieter?

12:43.851 --> 12:45.743
Yeah.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.663
Look, I had fun and everything...

12:54.884 --> 12:57.693
it's... you know, it's
not that I don't like you.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.193
Then why?

12:59.194 --> 13:01.213
I mean, what's wrong with me?

13:01.254 --> 13:03.413
Nothing.

13:03.414 --> 13:04.863
You're lovely, honestly.

13:07.024 --> 13:09.923
I haven't stopped thinking
about you since Cyprus.

13:12.884 --> 13:14.893
Yeah, I've been thinking about you too.

13:16.354 --> 13:18.463
It's just... timing, you know.

13:20.804 --> 13:22.863
Look, I'm sorry to have to tell you this

13:22.864 --> 13:24.413
but there's... someone else.

13:24.414 --> 13:25.823
OK? I just...

13:25.824 --> 13:29.433
I think you're so great, and gorgeous,

13:29.434 --> 13:33.043
and you've got such a massive...

13:33.044 --> 13:34.633
ego!

13:37.774 --> 13:39.083
Good one.

13:39.084 --> 13:41.473
I mean, seriously,
give yourself a break.

13:41.474 --> 13:43.403
It was one pissed up night.

13:43.404 --> 13:44.903
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:44.904 --> 13:46.353
So we're cool?

13:46.354 --> 13:48.083
We could not be cooler.

13:48.084 --> 13:49.403
Good.

13:53.664 --> 13:56.483
And it's none of my business but...

13:56.484 --> 13:58.633
I hope that other
girl isn't Georgie.

14:00.324 --> 14:02.383
You know she's got a
bloke back in Nepal?

14:12.093 --> 14:13.362
It's time to go, boss.

14:42.613 --> 14:44.672
I'm being eaten alive here.

14:44.673 --> 14:47.492
I reckon we're having it
better than SF out on a recce.

14:47.493 --> 14:48.802
Have you applied for selection yet?

14:48.803 --> 14:50.632
I thought they were
begging you to join up.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.602
Well, they are, but a man
of my talents is needed here.

14:52.603 --> 14:53.862
Right, yeah.

14:53.863 --> 14:55.602
All right, guys, a couple more rounds

14:55.603 --> 14:57.192
then I want everyone hitting the sack.

14:57.193 --> 14:59.392
Enforced rest, early start tomorrow.

14:59.393 --> 15:02.352
Sir, I don't think I'm
going to be able to sleep.

15:02.353 --> 15:05.492
Well, I definitely will, so don't
keep me awake with your yakking.

15:05.493 --> 15:07.322
Rab.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.442
Decent.

15:09.803 --> 15:11.822
Depends on the last cards.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.722
- Argh, I'm not picking that up!
- They're all yours.

15:14.723 --> 15:16.322
Take the whole pack...

15:16.323 --> 15:19.792
Look, everyone feels it
the day before a big one

15:19.793 --> 15:21.942
but try and slow your brain down.

15:23.143 --> 15:26.962
I'm depending on you tomorrow.
You have to channel those nerves.

15:26.963 --> 15:28.082
I won't let you down.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.602
Never thought you would.

15:31.603 --> 15:34.042
- Go on.
- Sergeant.

15:34.043 --> 15:36.612
Ten, ten, tens.

15:36.613 --> 15:37.882
Deal us in, then.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.042
Hi.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.682
Hiya, love, you all right?

15:47.683 --> 15:49.462
- Yeah, good, are you?
- Yeah.

15:49.463 --> 15:51.052
You've moved?

15:51.053 --> 15:54.522
Look, I've got proper
walls now and everything.

15:54.523 --> 15:56.962
I'm going up in the world.

15:56.963 --> 15:58.792
Where are you?

15:58.793 --> 15:59.962
Afghan.

15:59.963 --> 16:02.022
It's OK, it's a very short mission

16:02.023 --> 16:05.542
then we're going straight
back to Nepal, so don't worry.

16:05.543 --> 16:07.882
Can you tell us what
you're doing at least?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.462
Catching a bad guy.

16:10.463 --> 16:13.462
It's a support role, top team.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.202
It's all good, I promise.

16:15.203 --> 16:19.042
I am sorry, it's just your job...
I know I shouldn't worry so much.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.232
Right, I've got to go.

16:22.233 --> 16:23.822
Please be careful, sweetheart.

16:23.823 --> 16:25.232
Always.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.812
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

16:27.813 --> 16:29.682
It's all right, it's fine.

16:29.683 --> 16:32.452
About back there, me and
Elvis, we were just...

16:32.453 --> 16:35.452
Your mind should be on
this mission, nothing else.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.592
Not me, not Elvis, not Tara.

16:40.463 --> 16:41.782
Let's go. Let's go. Move!

16:41.783 --> 16:43.512
We stay inside.

16:43.513 --> 16:44.542
Shouldn't we help?

16:44.543 --> 16:46.892
We're not supposed to be here, remember.

16:46.893 --> 16:48.482
What's happening?

16:48.483 --> 16:51.202
Taliban are attacking the
base. The ANA will respond.

16:52.843 --> 16:56.072
But you cannot help this time.

16:56.073 --> 16:58.792
There's nothing we can do
here. We can't break our cover.

17:04.752 --> 17:05.922
Come in.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.502
All quiet?

17:11.502 --> 17:12.762
For now.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.002
Everything all right?

17:16.002 --> 17:17.732
This mission...

17:17.733 --> 17:21.152
it's too much of a risk.
I think we should abort.

17:25.473 --> 17:26.732
Why?

17:26.733 --> 17:30.062
The attack on the way
in, they know you're here.

17:31.423 --> 17:34.752
Perhaps, but they don't
know our intentions.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.362
Are you worried about your men?

17:38.363 --> 17:40.372
No, my men are fit and prepared.

17:40.373 --> 17:43.092
Then this mission is no riskier
than anything we've done before.

17:43.093 --> 17:45.672
I have a bad feeling, James.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.972
Long wars will do that to a man.

17:47.973 --> 17:51.342
We are taking a huge risk,
with my men and yours.

17:51.343 --> 17:53.552
It's what we signed up to do, Azizi,

17:53.553 --> 17:56.502
to protect your people
from men like Omar.

17:56.503 --> 17:58.142
We're in this together.

18:02.693 --> 18:04.802
Attention!

18:28.663 --> 18:31.712
Traktor by Wretch 32.

19:35.983 --> 19:37.382
It's pretty brazen, this.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.622
All the poppy growing.

19:40.623 --> 19:43.052
Coming to a street in
your home town soon.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.522
Mate, I'm pissing sweat here.

19:46.523 --> 19:49.432
You've a wonderful way
with words, Richards.

19:57.923 --> 19:59.842
Go on, Kingy, share the love.

19:59.843 --> 20:01.432
It's my daughter's birthday today.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.492
Managed to download
these back at the base.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.492
Let me see that.

20:08.183 --> 20:09.492
Sweet.

20:12.263 --> 20:14.372
She's 16.

20:14.373 --> 20:16.762
Boy, 16, don't know how that happened.

20:16.763 --> 20:19.712
16? You started early.

20:19.713 --> 20:21.212
Got two boys and all.

20:21.213 --> 20:22.762
Aww, your missus is a saint.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.622
- Good for you, though, Kingy, making it work.
- Yeah.

20:28.763 --> 20:30.262
Man, it's ripe in here.

20:32.323 --> 20:35.612
It's you, bro! You
smell worse than Kabul.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.612
I showered twice this morning
and used half a can of Lynx!

20:38.613 --> 20:40.532
Well you're not using it right, lad.

20:40.533 --> 20:41.560
You've got to get right in there,

20:41.561 --> 20:43.012
- in all the crevices, bud.
- Ey!

20:43.013 --> 20:45.592
Piss off, worry about your own crevices.

21:10.913 --> 21:14.052
Boss, I think we might have
a dicker: Bloke on a bike.

21:18.693 --> 21:20.802
Right, keep your eyes on him, Richards.

22:39.472 --> 22:41.431
Yes, can we get a shower?

22:41.432 --> 22:44.341
- Boss.
- See you in a bit.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.641
I love what you've
done with the place.

22:54.702 --> 22:57.041
Ooh, nice scar.

23:01.772 --> 23:03.941
Misjudged combat roll out of the 'chook.

23:03.942 --> 23:06.511
Check that out.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.061
Man, I can't see nothing.

23:08.062 --> 23:10.171
Fuck off, ten stitches went in there.

23:10.172 --> 23:13.411
Sat in the park near me
necking a bottle of 20/20...

23:13.412 --> 23:14.703
Classy.

23:14.704 --> 23:17.111
Fat Dave jumped on the
seesaw, I went flying,

23:17.112 --> 23:19.451
- teeth went straight through.
- Urgh!

23:19.452 --> 23:22.641
Fit nurse patched me up though.

23:22.642 --> 23:24.661
Decent.

23:24.662 --> 23:26.771
Don't tell your
sister I just said that.

23:28.822 --> 23:30.521
Where'd you get shot, Syria?

23:30.522 --> 23:31.921
Manchester.

23:31.922 --> 23:33.521
Serious?

23:33.522 --> 23:36.751
Elvis and Georgie keeping
the streets terrorist free.

23:36.752 --> 23:38.161
Lucky you was there, George?

23:38.162 --> 23:39.941
Should have phoned in sick that day.

23:41.952 --> 23:43.451
Rock drill in ten.

23:51.282 --> 23:52.411
Go on, Rab, lad.

23:55.312 --> 23:56.861
Yeah, wash them pits.

23:56.862 --> 23:58.411
You can't even smell anything.

23:58.412 --> 24:00.051
I think you better sniff 'em as well.

24:00.052 --> 24:02.821
Nothing. Mais, come and smell this.

24:02.822 --> 24:04.831
You do realise Maisie ain't interested?

24:04.832 --> 24:07.081
She ain't seen a bit of this yet, baby.

24:07.082 --> 24:08.441
Seen a bit of what?

24:10.832 --> 24:14.721
Listen in,
then. Omar's compound...

24:17.682 --> 24:20.251
Two vulnerable points.

24:20.252 --> 24:22.081
Point Alfa will be
over here, the breach.

24:22.082 --> 24:23.961
That's where me and my boys come in.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.441
Charlie, you and your boys
over here at Point Bravo,

24:26.442 --> 24:27.991
the irrigation ditch.

24:27.992 --> 24:31.181
Sentry guards change every morning.

24:31.182 --> 24:33.901
This will be our
opportunity to seize control.

24:33.942 --> 24:34.942
Captain.

24:36.152 --> 24:39.101
Charlie Fire Team, led by Kingy,

24:39.102 --> 24:42.051
will launch a
diversionary attack here...

24:43.372 --> 24:45.851
while Elvis's team
will launch an assault

24:45.852 --> 24:48.431
via support helicopter, here.

24:50.492 --> 24:53.301
I'll be waiting at the extraction
point with Delta Fire Team

24:53.302 --> 24:54.621
ready to cut the enemy off.

24:54.622 --> 24:56.731
And where's the casualty
collection point, sir?

24:56.732 --> 24:58.411
- With me.
- OK.

24:58.412 --> 25:00.801
- Any questions?
- Boss.

25:00.802 --> 25:01.981
Let's crack on.

25:04.092 --> 25:05.531
On me, boys.

25:10.932 --> 25:12.901
Everything all right, Richards?

25:12.942 --> 25:14.121
Yeah, boss.

25:15.852 --> 25:17.021
Spit it out.

25:18.202 --> 25:20.681
You remember that dicker
on the way out here?

25:22.462 --> 25:23.921
I think Azizi knows him.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.921
Well, did he talk to him?

25:29.922 --> 25:31.981
Not exactly.

25:32.022 --> 25:33.571
It was...

25:33.572 --> 25:35.211
It was sly.

25:35.212 --> 25:36.671
It was like a sly nod.

25:38.452 --> 25:42.481
Look, I know he's your mate, sir,
but you do hear about it, don't you?

25:42.482 --> 25:43.651
Green on blue.

25:46.372 --> 25:48.101
What would it look like

25:48.102 --> 25:50.641
if Azizi were to acknowledge
an innocent civilian?

25:50.642 --> 25:52.651
The same, boss, but...

25:52.652 --> 25:53.781
The same.

25:55.232 --> 25:57.341
Look, I saw something.

25:59.682 --> 26:03.571
I trust Azizi to stand beside me
the same way I trust all of you.

26:03.572 --> 26:04.651
Is that understand?

26:06.012 --> 26:07.421
Yes, boss.

26:27.812 --> 26:29.591
Think I might've cocked up.

26:29.592 --> 26:32.551
No way! You?!

26:32.552 --> 26:34.371
Go on.

26:34.372 --> 26:37.091
I thought Azizi knew that
dicker at the checkpoint.

26:37.092 --> 26:40.091
I told the boss, but he
reckons it's hearts and minds.

26:41.782 --> 26:43.611
I was right to say something, though?

26:45.202 --> 26:46.751
Yeah.

26:46.752 --> 26:48.861
It's not like I don't
get bollocked most days,

26:48.862 --> 26:50.871
but he had another go
at me about Da Chand.

26:50.872 --> 26:52.051
Look, I get it, all right?

26:52.052 --> 26:54.691
Letting him go does
seem a bit messed up.

26:54.692 --> 26:56.641
- A bit?
- Look, I'm agreeing with you.

26:56.642 --> 27:00.531
Look, if you weren't so switched
on, you wouldn't be a good soldier.

27:00.532 --> 27:04.091
But getting too involved, well,
that isn't great either, OK?

27:06.912 --> 27:08.311
You think I'm a good soldier?

27:08.312 --> 27:09.861
Don't push it.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.419
Could have given me the
"don't be an arsehole" chat

27:12.420 --> 27:13.990
- a little bit earlier.
- I did.

27:14.082 --> 27:16.911
- When?
- Kabul.

27:17.412 --> 27:20.171
I thought that was just
you tripping over Elvis.

27:22.522 --> 27:26.501
You are cool about... you
know? Cos if I'd have known...

27:26.502 --> 27:28.611
Look, me and Elvis are free agents, OK,

27:28.612 --> 27:31.381
so, no, I'm not "tripping".

28:34.382 --> 28:36.121
So, is it a superstition thing?

28:36.122 --> 28:38.701
Just something I do before a mission.

28:38.702 --> 28:41.231
Keeps the head clear.

28:41.232 --> 28:43.241
Up here for thinking, Peanut?

28:44.792 --> 28:47.091
It's all kicking off at home.

28:47.092 --> 28:50.561
Rachel wants booze at her
party, Jules isn't having it.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.571
Choose your side carefully.

28:52.572 --> 28:55.381
My 16th was a mega lash.

28:55.382 --> 28:57.401
My nan got ASBO'd.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.031
So being a piss head
runs in the family, then?

29:00.032 --> 29:02.841
Like being a wanker
runs in yours, yeah?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.431
Guys, you're not helping.

29:04.932 --> 29:08.281
No, the boys are easy, you know?
They're bears, like you lot.

29:08.282 --> 29:10.851
Throw them an apple, kick them
in the nuts, it's all good,

29:10.852 --> 29:13.391
but Rachel, she's... powerful.

29:13.392 --> 29:15.591
You should start a
support group with my dad.

29:15.592 --> 29:17.181
There's three of us.

29:17.182 --> 29:19.711
No, thank you!

29:19.712 --> 29:22.151
No, you've got to support
your missus, Kingy.

29:22.152 --> 29:23.371
You've got to back her.

29:23.372 --> 29:26.461
You just said your
16th was "proper messy".

29:26.462 --> 29:28.481
Exactly.

29:28.482 --> 29:31.901
But cos I can always wrap
my dad around this, see?

29:31.902 --> 29:33.591
He went down the offy for us.

29:33.592 --> 29:35.651
I'm struggling to work out
the moral of this story.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.231
He shouldn't have sided
with me, should he?

29:38.232 --> 29:40.391
The kids are a team,
the parents are a team.

29:40.392 --> 29:43.581
I'd have respected him more
for solidarity to his platoon.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.451
I like that.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.471
- There you go.
- You're right.

29:47.472 --> 29:49.581
Mate, I should've been
one of them agony aunts.

29:49.582 --> 29:52.531
All this wisdom is just wasted
on you lot. Especially you.

29:52.532 --> 29:56.331
Now, let's see if she still likes
me when we get back to Nepal?

29:56.332 --> 29:59.511
Hey, it's come to something when
the light at the end of the tunnel

29:59.512 --> 30:02.051
- is returning to a disaster zone.
- You know what I mean?

30:02.052 --> 30:03.361
I hear that, I hear that.

30:03.362 --> 30:06.411
Yeah, you must be looking forward
to getting back to Nepal, Lane?

30:11.192 --> 30:12.971
It's a beautiful country.

30:12.972 --> 30:15.691
Yeah, beautiful
country, friendly people.

30:18.732 --> 30:19.951
Is that a problem?

30:21.872 --> 30:23.941
Nah. No problem at all.

30:25.952 --> 30:27.311
All done, pal.

30:28.582 --> 30:32.751
Erm, so how did your nan get ASBO'd?

30:32.752 --> 30:35.941
My God, she tried to take a
piss on next door's front garden.

30:35.982 --> 30:39.131
Like slash attack!

30:51.272 --> 30:53.241
What the fuck was that about?

30:53.242 --> 30:54.781
Georgie, I'm sorry, truly.

30:54.782 --> 30:57.081
What exactly is your problem?

30:57.082 --> 30:59.521
You!

30:59.562 --> 31:01.911
Just you with someone else.

31:01.912 --> 31:04.060
Here we go again.

31:04.468 --> 31:07.329
- What, you don't think I know how this goes?
- How what goes?

31:07.338 --> 31:09.557
The second, the very second,
I'm with someone else,

31:09.560 --> 31:11.987
- there you are trying to fuck it all up.
- That's not fucking fair.

31:11.988 --> 31:13.587
But embarrassing me out
there in front of all them,

31:13.588 --> 31:14.667
that was fair, was it?

31:14.668 --> 31:16.631
How about not turning
up on my wedding day?

31:16.632 --> 31:18.977
Was that fucking fair?

31:18.978 --> 31:22.027
Hey, and when I was on my
own, where were you, hey?

31:22.028 --> 31:25.497
Yeah, that's right, shagging
Richards on decompression.

31:26.098 --> 31:28.067
Fucking fair!

31:28.168 --> 31:29.527
Are you serious about him?

31:33.838 --> 31:36.317
You're unreal. You are unreal!

31:40.358 --> 31:42.417
I said are you serious about him?

31:42.418 --> 31:44.427
That's none of your fucking business.

31:47.478 --> 31:50.287
I wondered if you might
have some spare supplies

31:50.288 --> 31:52.397
so I can help if
anyone is hurt tomorrow?

31:56.108 --> 31:57.327
I can come back later.

31:57.328 --> 31:59.807
No, no, it's fine. It's fine.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.967
We're done.

32:07.408 --> 32:08.617
Right, let's go.

32:55.268 --> 32:56.817
Not bad for an old man.

33:00.798 --> 33:02.487
I'm sorry about the graffiti.

33:04.078 --> 33:06.187
Do not bother on my account.

33:06.188 --> 33:08.957
I am familiar with the
allied sense of humour.

33:16.968 --> 33:19.127
Does our presence here frustrate you?

33:21.468 --> 33:22.597
Yes.

33:24.378 --> 33:25.647
You're surprised?

33:27.048 --> 33:29.487
You abandoned us to our fate

33:29.488 --> 33:33.287
and now you return and
bring with you more chaos.

33:34.688 --> 33:36.427
Maybe we were naive

33:36.428 --> 33:39.847
but there was so much
optimism when the allies left.

33:39.848 --> 33:41.257
We thought we could win.

33:44.488 --> 33:45.897
And now you don't?

33:45.898 --> 33:47.067
Look around you.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.327
We don't have the
methods, the equipment.

33:51.328 --> 33:53.487
The Taliban are as
strong as they ever were.

33:53.488 --> 33:56.437
The war continues and
we make no progress.

33:56.438 --> 33:59.257
Catching warlords like Omar is progress.

34:01.978 --> 34:04.697
- You do still believe in what we're doing here?
- Do you?

34:04.698 --> 34:07.367
Do I believe it's the right
thing to catch men like Omar?

34:07.368 --> 34:09.377
Yes, 100%.

34:14.728 --> 34:16.877
There are many Omars.

34:18.288 --> 34:22.177
Catching one changes nothing.

34:24.148 --> 34:26.487
I'm tired, James.

34:26.487 --> 34:30.847
All I want is for this war to end.

34:30.848 --> 34:32.257
Yeah, I understand that,

34:32.257 --> 34:35.487
but men like you are key
to this country's future...

34:35.487 --> 34:36.847
men who refuse to give up,

34:36.848 --> 34:40.036
who believe that one day
all this will be over.

34:44.257 --> 34:45.427
Be careful.

34:48.058 --> 34:49.177
Always, my friend.

35:00.528 --> 35:04.367
OK, there's some haemostatic
dressing, there's a tourniquet.

35:04.368 --> 35:07.787
Do you remember your skills
and drills from training?

35:07.788 --> 35:10.417
Corporal, it's Tara.

35:10.418 --> 35:13.227
Let me see what else I can dig
out. I'll come and find you.

35:13.228 --> 35:14.397
- Thank you.
- OK.

35:14.398 --> 35:17.357
Don't worry. I can make it to the UK.

35:17.358 --> 35:19.787
Then, maybe I will be Prime Minister.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.437
I will call you soon.

35:24.438 --> 35:27.437
Well, we know she's alive,
that's the main thing.

35:30.898 --> 35:33.477
It's my fault, isn't it?
I put that in her head...

35:33.478 --> 35:36.107
"Prime Minister". How stupid was that?

35:36.108 --> 35:37.837
You gave her something to hope for.

35:37.838 --> 35:40.327
Yeah, and what if she doesn't make it?

35:40.328 --> 35:43.977
The one thing this job teaches you
is you can't control everything.

35:43.978 --> 35:47.167
We do what we can and
try and shut out the rest,

35:47.168 --> 35:49.377
otherwise it'll drive you insane.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.557
I'll let Milan know.

35:54.058 --> 35:59.357
What happened earlier with Elvis,
I think that might be on me.

36:01.698 --> 36:03.627
I told him about Milan.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.157
- Nice one.
- Well, I didn't think it was a big deal.

36:06.158 --> 36:08.737
It isn't. I'd just rather
not have my private life

36:08.738 --> 36:10.697
be the source of company gossip.

36:10.698 --> 36:12.157
Yeah, but I couldn't help it.

36:12.158 --> 36:14.267
He was trying to give
me the big brush off,

36:14.268 --> 36:17.777
like I'm even interested.

36:17.778 --> 36:19.887
Now, look, I am sorry.

36:19.888 --> 36:22.797
- I thought it was history between you two.
- It is.

36:22.798 --> 36:25.237
Are you sure Elvis got the memo?

36:25.238 --> 36:28.467
Well, if he hadn't, he has now.

36:40.238 --> 36:41.497
Right, guys, on me.

36:43.608 --> 36:45.717
Try not to shit yourself this time.

36:45.718 --> 36:47.597
Worry about your own arse, mate.

37:13.428 --> 37:15.257
You're all aware of your missions.

37:17.508 --> 37:19.797
I'm trusting you guys, as always.

37:21.438 --> 37:24.207
Keep your eyes on.

37:25.428 --> 37:26.547
Stay focused...

37:27.628 --> 37:29.087
stay alert...

37:30.398 --> 37:31.427
and stay alive.

38:04.198 --> 38:07.057
Hello, all stations. Radio check. Over.

38:10.098 --> 38:12.067
Hello, Alfa Two Zero, this is Zero Alfa.

38:12.068 --> 38:14.557
Please confirm your position
at the start line. Over.

38:14.558 --> 38:18.257
Alfa Two Zero. Roger
that. Position set. Over.

38:19.428 --> 38:21.117
Zero Alfa to Tango One Zero.

38:22.388 --> 38:24.497
Tango One Zero. Send. Over.

38:24.538 --> 38:27.727
All call signs are in
position at Cherry Tree Lane.

38:27.728 --> 38:30.067
Daffodil is good to go. Over.

38:30.068 --> 38:31.287
Roger that. Out.

38:38.508 --> 38:40.477
Hello, this is Tango One Zero.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.477
All call signs prepare
to initiate Phase One.

38:43.478 --> 38:45.637
Standby, standby!

38:45.638 --> 38:47.417
Initiate.

39:41.188 --> 39:44.707
- Zero Alfa. Ten liner. Wait up.
- Boss?

39:44.808 --> 39:47.747
Enemy, 50 metres, hard left!

39:55.488 --> 39:57.357
Man down. Man down.

39:57.358 --> 39:59.377
Take cover!

40:00.928 --> 40:02.327
Engage!

40:06.876 --> 40:08.655
Alpha Two Zero, do
you require assistance?

40:08.656 --> 40:11.655
I say again. Do you
require assistance? Over.

40:11.696 --> 40:13.335
Tango One Zero cleared
that area at 0400.

40:13.336 --> 40:15.875
- Must have been receded since then.
- They knew we were coming.

40:18.826 --> 40:21.545
Hello, Zero Alpha.
This is Alpha Two Zero.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.885
Do you read me? Over.

40:23.886 --> 40:25.435
Does anyone have working comms?

40:25.436 --> 40:27.595
- No, Sarge!
- No, Sergeant!

40:27.596 --> 40:29.185
- Argh!
- IED's affected the comms.

40:29.186 --> 40:31.245
Trying to reestablish
the connection now.

40:31.246 --> 40:33.305
- Boss, we've got to help them.
- Don't move.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.885
- I need to help...
- Hold your position, eyes on the high ground.

40:35.886 --> 40:38.935
Fingers, keep on trying. Hello,
Tango One Zero. This is Zero Alpha.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.295
Phase One has been compromised.

40:40.296 --> 40:43.105
I say again, Phase One
has been compromised.

40:43.106 --> 40:44.655
Acknowledge my last.

40:44.656 --> 40:47.935
Well, it appears to have
all gone Pete Tong, fellas.

40:47.936 --> 40:49.345
No change there, then.

40:49.346 --> 40:52.245
Hello, this is Tango
One Zero to all stations.

40:52.246 --> 40:53.885
Continue with Phase Two.

40:53.926 --> 40:57.125
I say again, continue
with Phase Two. Out.

40:59.466 --> 41:01.995
Kalil, on the medic, now.

41:06.176 --> 41:07.395
We need to move.

41:07.396 --> 41:10.395
30 yards, half right. Dead ground.

41:10.396 --> 41:13.715
OK, people, you heard
her. That's our plan.

41:13.716 --> 41:15.125
Can you move him?

41:15.126 --> 41:18.061
- I can try.
- Zero Alpha, this is Alpha Two Zero.

41:18.062 --> 41:19.265
Permission to move.

41:19.626 --> 41:21.175
Over.

41:21.176 --> 41:22.955
Fuck...

41:22.956 --> 41:24.645
Boss, we need to go and help them.

41:24.646 --> 41:27.365
We wait until we know
what's going on, Lane!

41:27.366 --> 41:30.315
On my signal, we're going to
make a break for the dead ground.

41:30.316 --> 41:32.615
Go low and let's get
the fuck out of here.

41:32.616 --> 41:35.095
Kalil, prepare to move.

41:35.096 --> 41:37.015
On me... Go, now!

41:37.016 --> 41:38.935
Double, double, double!

41:38.936 --> 41:41.045
Three, two, one... Go!

41:43.446 --> 41:44.705
Aargh!

41:53.376 --> 41:55.905
Shit! Man down!

41:55.906 --> 41:57.835
Fuck!

41:57.836 --> 41:59.515
Hello, Zero Alpha.

41:59.916 --> 42:02.895
Hello, Zero Alpha,
this is Alpha Two Zero.

42:02.896 --> 42:06.595
Zero Alpha, I never thought I'd
be so pleased to hear your voice.

42:06.636 --> 42:09.365
Send me a sitrep. Over.

42:09.366 --> 42:13.115
We've got three men
injured. One cat A, one cat B

42:13.116 --> 42:16.205
and Kalil's got a gunshot
wound, left shoulder. Out.

42:16.206 --> 42:19.305
If you think this is getting you a
sympathy shag, you can think again.

42:19.306 --> 42:21.555
What about a hand job?

42:21.556 --> 42:24.085
What, for a little
nick like that? Jog on.

42:24.086 --> 42:27.135
Boss, those casualties will
bleed out without any treatment.

42:27.136 --> 42:29.055
This isn't up for discussion, Lane.

42:31.066 --> 42:33.085
LANE! Lane, you get back here!

42:33.086 --> 42:35.005
What do you think you are doing?

42:35.006 --> 42:37.205
You are in danger!

42:37.206 --> 42:39.225
Lane, back off!

42:40.306 --> 42:41.855
Lane!

42:57.506 --> 43:00.505
Fingers, give covering fire!

43:00.506 --> 43:02.335
No line of sight, boss!

43:34.826 --> 43:36.325
Mayday. Mayday.

43:36.326 --> 43:37.915
Returning to Kabul.

43:45.986 --> 43:47.435
Zero Alpha, this is Tango One Zero.

43:47.436 --> 43:48.845
Breach.

44:02.956 --> 44:04.075
Clear!

44:10.736 --> 44:12.095
Clear!

44:31.076 --> 44:32.575
You took your fucking time.

44:32.576 --> 44:33.895
Looking good, Rab.

44:33.896 --> 44:36.465
- Never better, Lane.
- Put the bandage on, OK?

44:36.466 --> 44:38.855
I need to deal with the cat
A. I'll be back in a second.

44:38.856 --> 44:41.905
Take your time, Lane. Maisie's
enjoying copping a feel.

44:41.906 --> 44:43.965
Mate. You are such a freak.

44:43.966 --> 44:45.935
We're going to get you out of here, OK?

44:45.936 --> 44:48.935
All right, keep talking to
me, yeah? Keep talking to me.

44:48.936 --> 44:52.265
Malik, keep talking to him, please.
We're getting you out of here.

44:52.266 --> 44:55.405
Nice work. You might
have just saved his life.

44:55.406 --> 44:56.865
Thank you.

45:17.816 --> 45:19.365
Aargh!

45:22.176 --> 45:24.285
Get him under cover!

45:33.896 --> 45:35.915
Aww, you Taliban tossers!

45:35.916 --> 45:37.455
Tango One Zero to all stations.

45:37.456 --> 45:39.945
We have a man down, man
down. No sign of target.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.305
We are bugging out. Over.

45:45.806 --> 45:47.865
We need to get the
injured out of here, now.

45:47.866 --> 45:49.175
There's no chance.

45:50.306 --> 45:51.945
- Richards!
- Maisie?

45:51.946 --> 45:55.455
Right, everyone, keep your heads down!

45:55.456 --> 45:56.915
I felt that.

45:56.916 --> 45:58.275
Can anyone see the enemy?

45:58.276 --> 46:00.995
Look at me. Look at me. Are you OK?

46:00.996 --> 46:03.805
- My ears are ringing!
- OK, look at me, look at me, look at me.

46:03.806 --> 46:05.865
Look at me. What do you need to do next?

46:05.866 --> 46:09.565
Remember your
training. Stay focused.

46:09.566 --> 46:11.635
What do you need to do next?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.675
- Look after Rab.
- Georgie, how's she doing?

46:17.676 --> 46:19.745
I think she's all right. She's lucky.

46:19.746 --> 46:23.075
All right. Look at my finger, follow it.

46:23.076 --> 46:25.035
- Tell me when you can see it.
- Yeah.

46:25.036 --> 46:27.755
- Yeah? This one?
- Yeah.

46:27.756 --> 46:30.385
OK, all right. Are you OK?

46:30.386 --> 46:31.605
- Yeah.
- Right, OK.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.415
Taliban must be losing their touch,

46:34.416 --> 46:36.245
missing a target as big as your napper.

46:49.366 --> 46:51.615
Vehicle approaching from compound.

46:51.616 --> 46:53.025
50 metres, red truck,

46:53.026 --> 46:55.325
moving right to left. Shoot!

46:57.656 --> 47:00.015
Stopping!

47:02.306 --> 47:05.915
All call signs, this is Zero Alpha.

47:05.956 --> 47:08.775
Taliban appear to be retreating.

47:08.776 --> 47:10.555
SF have man down.

47:10.556 --> 47:12.015
Roger, over.

47:14.636 --> 47:17.405
Fingers, Brains, push forward,
help secure the compound.

47:17.406 --> 47:20.735
- Boss.
- Khan, you follow, support Zero Four Alpha.

47:26.876 --> 47:28.465
Azizi! Watch out!

47:36.066 --> 47:38.635
It was you? You told
them we were coming?

47:38.636 --> 47:41.025
How could you do this? I trusted you!

47:41.026 --> 47:42.245
I warned you.

47:42.246 --> 47:44.875
I told you to abort the
mission, but you wouldn't listen.

47:44.876 --> 47:47.025
Do you know how many men's
lives you've put in danger?

47:47.026 --> 47:48.715
You still don't understand.

47:48.716 --> 47:51.295
There can be no peace in Afghanistan
whilst the allies are here.

47:51.296 --> 47:53.125
You think the Taliban
will bring you peace?

47:53.126 --> 47:54.905
Not while they are responding
to allied bombs, no.

47:54.906 --> 47:58.045
You strike, they retaliate...
on and on for 17 years

47:58.046 --> 48:00.245
and stuck in the middle is Afghanistan.

48:00.246 --> 48:01.845
What, so it's our fault?!

48:01.846 --> 48:03.855
I will NOT watch my country die!

48:03.856 --> 48:05.265
You would rather watch ME die?

48:05.266 --> 48:07.705
I tried to warn you.

48:07.706 --> 48:09.905
No, I won't let you walk away from this!

48:09.906 --> 48:11.315
No!

48:13.706 --> 48:15.205
Fuck!

48:15.206 --> 48:17.125
Azizi! Fuck!

48:17.126 --> 48:18.345
Fuck!

48:18.346 --> 48:19.755
Azizi!

48:19.756 --> 48:21.675
It's all right, Azizi. I've got you.

48:43.336 --> 48:44.595
Clear.

48:45.956 --> 48:47.315
Do you reckon we got Omar?

48:47.316 --> 48:49.475
One of this lot must have
told him we were coming.

48:49.476 --> 48:51.205
He'll be long gone. You, here.

48:55.056 --> 48:58.335
Hello, all call signs.
This is Zero Four Alpha.

48:58.376 --> 49:00.115
Compound looks to be clear.

49:00.116 --> 49:02.225
No live bogies in this location.

49:02.226 --> 49:05.225
Now securing area to
establish a Charlie Alpha Papa.

49:05.226 --> 49:07.755
Confirm location from
Tango One Zero. Over.

49:14.226 --> 49:16.755
Fuck! You're going to be all right.

49:18.776 --> 49:20.555
Man down!

49:21.956 --> 49:23.785
Stay with me.

49:28.096 --> 49:29.645
Watch your footing.

49:29.646 --> 49:32.225
On me, Rab.

49:32.226 --> 49:33.775
All right, put him down there.

49:35.036 --> 49:36.865
One, two, three...

49:36.866 --> 49:38.835
Rab, sit down here.

49:40.006 --> 49:41.745
- All yours.
- That's it.

49:47.326 --> 49:49.245
I knew it was you.

49:49.246 --> 49:51.215
I could tell.

49:54.026 --> 49:55.104
Must he love.

49:56.425 --> 49:59.184
Nah, I just heard some
big Doris screaming.

49:59.185 --> 50:02.654
I thought, "That's definitely
not me. Must be Rab."

50:02.655 --> 50:05.604
You did good, mate. ANA wouldn't
have made it back without you.

50:05.605 --> 50:07.104
Well done.

50:08.985 --> 50:11.894
It's not pretty, but it's a flesh
wound. You're going to be all right.

50:11.895 --> 50:14.654
What?! All that screaming,
just for a scratch?!

50:14.655 --> 50:16.484
Will I still have a scar?

50:16.485 --> 50:20.284
If you ask her nicely, Lane
might stitch you up messy.

50:20.285 --> 50:21.644
Turn that way.

50:21.645 --> 50:23.894
I thought I was finally
getting rid of you.

50:23.895 --> 50:26.654
No chance. You heard Kingy.

50:26.655 --> 50:28.764
I was critical to operations.

50:28.765 --> 50:31.954
Lane, we've got a gunshot
wound. He's lost a lot of blood.

50:38.005 --> 50:39.314
Bring him through, quick!

50:42.695 --> 50:44.844
Upper left thigh. Think
it's a through and through.

50:44.845 --> 50:45.873
You with me, Dyno, yeah?

50:45.874 --> 50:47.474
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Sit down, mate, OK?

50:47.475 --> 50:49.394
All right, it's an in and
out, but it's a bleeder.

50:49.395 --> 50:50.704
I need an ETA on the MERT.

50:50.705 --> 50:53.215
- Hello, this is Tango One Zero.
- Help me!

50:53.216 --> 50:54.974
- I need an ETA on the MERT.
- Lane!

50:56.425 --> 50:59.144
- On here!
- One, two, three...

50:59.145 --> 51:02.004
What's happened? Boss?

51:02.005 --> 51:03.644
All right. Azizi?

51:03.645 --> 51:05.804
- Azizi?
- Captain?

51:06.965 --> 51:08.804
Gunshot wound to the chest.

51:09.925 --> 51:11.564
No exit wound.

51:13.025 --> 51:16.064
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

51:16.065 --> 51:18.314
Stay with me, OK? You're all right.

51:18.315 --> 51:19.724
Is he going to die?

51:19.725 --> 51:21.974
We need to get him stable.
Get me a chest seal.

51:24.925 --> 51:29.144
Tell them... there was no other way.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.674
You told them we were coming?

51:44.615 --> 51:45.784
Shit!

51:47.145 --> 51:48.744
Got no pulse.

51:49.865 --> 51:51.644
All right, bag him.

51:51.645 --> 51:53.754
Bag him! Quick!

52:03.885 --> 52:05.434
Here.

52:07.495 --> 52:09.464
- Boss...
- Leave it.

52:12.745 --> 52:14.714
He's gone. He's gone.

52:34.125 --> 52:35.854
How does this shit even get here?

52:35.855 --> 52:39.414
Hey, this looks like it
came out of China yesterday.

52:41.105 --> 52:43.444
Least we got some souvenirs, mate?

52:43.445 --> 52:45.134
40 minutes to bag up and extract.

52:45.135 --> 52:48.094
Let's get out of here before the
Taliban have a chance to reorg.

52:48.095 --> 52:49.544
- Boss.
- There you are, Brains.

52:51.185 --> 52:52.774
Fingers?

53:00.045 --> 53:03.564
Helicopter on the pad. Rotors turning.

53:06.745 --> 53:08.524
I shouldn't have trusted him.

53:09.935 --> 53:11.204
I'm a bloody idiot.

53:14.205 --> 53:16.124
Charlie, this place is messed up.

53:18.505 --> 53:21.094
All right? Don't drive yourself
mad trying to make sense of it.

53:21.095 --> 53:22.824
We could have lost everyone!

53:26.575 --> 53:28.124
Richards tried to tell me.

53:32.905 --> 53:34.924
What have we achieved, Elvis?

53:36.235 --> 53:38.204
I've done five tours of Afghanistan.

53:39.655 --> 53:41.114
For what?

53:48.655 --> 53:50.344
You think he acted alone?

53:51.755 --> 53:53.904
You mean can we still trust his men?

53:55.505 --> 53:56.594
How can we know?

53:58.125 --> 54:00.794
I'm just glad it's a support
helicopter and not a road move.

54:22.225 --> 54:24.094
Kingfisher. Send.

54:41.675 --> 54:43.454
Extraction in 20 minutes.

54:43.455 --> 54:44.864
Thanks.

54:46.595 --> 54:48.194
How's Dyno doing?

54:48.195 --> 54:49.744
He's stable.

54:52.835 --> 54:54.804
Hey, come on.

54:54.805 --> 54:57.144
You are going to get
ME going in a minute.

54:57.145 --> 54:58.504
No, it's fine. It's just...

54:59.765 --> 55:02.634
God, it's just this fucking
place, you know what I mean?

55:04.885 --> 55:06.424
Try not to let it get to you.

55:06.425 --> 55:08.584
Kingy!

55:09.945 --> 55:11.774
I lost Azizi.

55:13.135 --> 55:15.144
I mean, Dyno was close.

55:16.695 --> 55:18.104
I thought he was...

55:20.775 --> 55:23.304
Well, at least we know you
don't want me dead any more.

55:24.995 --> 55:28.224
Don't get excited.
That's a very low bar.

55:30.525 --> 55:32.864
OK.

55:34.085 --> 55:35.824
Wait.

55:39.385 --> 55:40.884
You were right.

55:40.885 --> 55:43.554
You know, about the way I've acted.

55:43.555 --> 55:44.964
It wasn't fair.

55:49.225 --> 55:51.994
But I do think you're wrong
when you say we're done.

55:56.075 --> 55:58.694
Nothing's changed for me, Georgie.

56:01.085 --> 56:03.104
I'm still madly in love with you.

56:08.265 --> 56:10.884
And if you don't feel the same,
I'll leave and I mean it this time.

56:10.885 --> 56:13.314
I'll let you go. I'll let
you get on with your life...

56:15.385 --> 56:17.164
IF you say you don't love me.

56:25.375 --> 56:26.964
Loving each other...

56:28.465 --> 56:30.714
was never the problem, Elvis.

56:34.885 --> 56:36.994
It can't work.

56:39.765 --> 56:41.264
What's happened?

56:41.265 --> 56:43.844
The support helicopters
have had a nofly,

56:43.845 --> 56:45.574
due to a sandstorm two miles east.

56:45.575 --> 56:46.884
We're in the shit here.

56:46.885 --> 56:49.094
Tango One Zero, all my call signs on me.

56:51.105 --> 56:52.704
How are we going to get out?

56:57.252 --> 56:59.031
We're sitting ducks here.

57:00.532 --> 57:02.271
After Azizi switching sides,

57:02.272 --> 57:03.961
I don't trust any of them.

57:06.212 --> 57:07.471
Can you hear me?

57:07.472 --> 57:08.781
Have you done this before?

57:08.782 --> 57:10.001
No.

57:11.322 --> 57:14.031
With all due respect, sir,
we've all lost friends here.

57:14.032 --> 57:18.111
Me, I don't want to think they
might have died for nothing.
