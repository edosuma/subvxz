We're not...

01:26.533 --> 01:28.364
who...

01:28.435 --> 01:34.396
we are.

01:34.474 --> 01:36.704
We're not...

01:36.810 --> 01:39.244
who we are.

01:41.815 --> 01:45.581
lt goes no further than this.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.808
Mulder: This team ofscientists
made up the Arctic lce Core Project.

04:27.881 --> 04:29.246
Theywere sent to Alaska

04:29.316 --> 04:32.410
by the government's advanced research
project agency

04:32.485 --> 04:35.318
nearly a year ago to drill
into the arctic ice.

04:35.388 --> 04:36.855
The samples they removed

04:36.923 --> 04:39.414
contained trapped gases, dust,
chemicals--

04:39.492 --> 04:40.982
Evidence that could reveal

04:41.061 --> 04:43.188
the structure ofthe Earth's climate

04:43.296 --> 04:45.059
back to the dawn ofman.

04:45.165 --> 04:47.292
Theirworkwas a success,
nearly completed.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.494
No reports or indications
ofproblems ofany kind

04:50.570 --> 04:52.037
until only a week later

04:52.105 --> 04:54.335
this next transmission was received.

04:59.879 --> 05:01.403

(Groan)

05:33.446 --> 05:35.277
What happened up there?

05:35.348 --> 05:36.679
Nobody's been able

05:36.750 --> 05:39.617
to reach the compound
because ofbad weather.

05:39.686 --> 05:41.017
Obviously they think

05:41.087 --> 05:43.078
we're either brilliant or expendable

05:43.156 --> 05:45.283
because we've pulled the assignment.

05:45.358 --> 05:47.349
ls it severe isolation distress?

05:47.427 --> 05:49.088
These were top geophysicists.

05:49.195 --> 05:51.857
Theywere trained and screened
for this project

05:51.965 --> 05:55.059
in everyway imaginable,
including psychological makeup.

05:55.168 --> 05:56.635
We leave for Nome today.

05:56.703 --> 05:58.466
We'll meet up
with three scientists

05:58.538 --> 06:00.369
familiarwith the project

06:00.440 --> 06:03.739
and then head north
up to the lcy Cape.

06:03.810 --> 06:07.109
The National Weather Service
reports a three-daywindow

06:07.180 --> 06:10.445
to get in and get out
before the next arctic storm.

06:10.517 --> 06:12.041

06:26.533 --> 06:28.000
Touchdown!

06:28.101 --> 06:30.069
Fouts is God!

06:34.007 --> 06:36.635
Sorry. My team scored.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.735
There's no football on Wednesday.

06:38.812 --> 06:41.679
Fouts retired in '87,
didn't he?

06:41.748 --> 06:44.911
This is some ofmy all-time
favorite plays on tape.

06:44.984 --> 06:46.383
You two F.B.l.?

06:46.453 --> 06:48.751
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. And you?

06:48.822 --> 06:49.846
Danny Murphy.

06:49.923 --> 06:51.481
Professor ofgeology, U.C. San Diego.

06:51.558 --> 06:54.584
You get much ofa chance
to study ice down there?

06:54.661 --> 06:55.992
just what's around the keg.

06:58.298 --> 07:00.732
Dr. DaSilva?
Dr. Hodge?

07:00.800 --> 07:02.267
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.

07:02.368 --> 07:03.596
Nice to meetyou.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.604
Howyou doing?

07:05.672 --> 07:07.640
Can l see some identification?

07:07.707 --> 07:08.901
What for?

07:08.975 --> 07:11.603
l just want to make sure
we are who we saywe are.

07:15.915 --> 07:18.281
lt's me.

07:18.351 --> 07:19.750
lt's you.

07:19.819 --> 07:21.150
lt's me.

07:21.221 --> 07:22.711
lt's you.

07:22.789 --> 07:24.313
- lt's me.
- Thanks a lot.

07:24.390 --> 07:25.550
Appreciate it.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.217
lt's you.

07:27.293 --> 07:29.284
Well, now that we know who we are

07:29.395 --> 07:30.794
anybody care to take a guess

07:30.864 --> 07:33.264
as to whywe're going?

07:33.333 --> 07:35.198
Two agents, a geologist,
a medical doctor

07:35.268 --> 07:36.667
and a toxicologist.

07:36.736 --> 07:39.170
That should give us some idea.

07:39.239 --> 07:42.174
l assumeyou all
took a look at the tape.

07:44.778 --> 07:46.712
Something wrong?

07:46.780 --> 07:48.543
Come on. You're F.B.l.

07:48.615 --> 07:50.810
You have to know
more than we do.

07:58.057 --> 07:59.991
You folks the ones
going up to lcy Cape?

08:00.059 --> 08:01.287
Yeah.

08:01.394 --> 08:04.329
Then l'm fying you.
My name is Bear.

08:04.397 --> 08:06.331
The plane's across the way.

08:06.399 --> 08:08.333
Provisions are loaded.
Grabyour gear.

08:08.401 --> 08:10.335
Oh, could we see
some credentials?

08:13.439 --> 08:14.963
Credentials.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.565
The only credentials l have

08:16.643 --> 08:19.846
is that l'm the only pilot
willing to fyyou up there.

08:19.846 --> 08:20.437
is that l'm the only pilot
willing to fyyou up there.

08:20.513 --> 08:23.073
You don't like
those credentials...

08:23.149 --> 08:25.447
walk.

08:53.012 --> 08:58.279
Bear... see ifyou
can get the power started.

08:58.351 --> 09:01.320
Anything to get out ofhere.

09:05.158 --> 09:07.592
Where do we start?

09:07.660 --> 09:09.651
Body bags are on the plane.

09:09.762 --> 09:11.423
Before we touch anything

09:11.531 --> 09:14.295
we have to thoroughly
document the scene.

09:22.842 --> 09:24.776
Scully: Flashing.

09:39.659 --> 09:41.889
Mulder: That's what
theywere drilling for.

09:43.162 --> 09:46.097
Quarter ofa million years
melting away

09:46.165 --> 09:48.099
in a couple ofdays.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.635
l want to preserve
some samples.

10:10.490 --> 10:12.754
(Rumbling)

10:12.825 --> 10:14.520
lt's the generator.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.424
Oh.

10:28.608 --> 10:29.905
Agent Mulder...

10:29.976 --> 10:33.207
(Screaming)

10:35.081 --> 10:37.208
(Barking)

10:40.954 --> 10:43.081
Hold on.

10:44.824 --> 10:46.257
(Groans)

10:50.863 --> 10:52.353
Hold it down.

11:00.073 --> 11:01.938
That will keep him
out for awhile.

11:07.180 --> 11:08.272
You okay?

11:08.348 --> 11:09.940
Yeah, he didn't break the skin.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.244
Bear, you okay?

11:11.317 --> 11:12.784
He got me.

11:12.852 --> 11:14.342
Get thatjacket off.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.615
Give me the stuff.
l'll do it myself.

11:16.689 --> 11:18.680
DaSilva: ls it rabies?

11:25.865 --> 11:28.800
l don't see any indications.

11:28.868 --> 11:30.426
lfit is rabies

11:30.536 --> 11:33.471
it's certainly not a strain
l'm familiarwith.

11:33.539 --> 11:36.099
Scully:
Look at this. Black nodules.

11:36.175 --> 11:37.836
Swollen lymph nodes.

11:37.910 --> 11:40.276
Symptoms ofbubonic plague.

11:40.346 --> 11:43.713
l'll do a blood test.
We'll take it from there.

11:43.783 --> 11:45.808
This dog has got

11:45.885 --> 11:49.514
a skin irritation
on its neck.

11:49.589 --> 11:51.955
Murphy: lt looks like
it's been scratching off

11:52.025 --> 11:53.583
its own hair.

11:53.659 --> 11:55.627
Look at this.
Look at this!

11:58.998 --> 12:02.058
What the hell was that?

12:11.544 --> 12:13.444
(Groans)

12:43.876 --> 12:45.571
From the autopsies

12:45.645 --> 12:48.409
it's clear these men
killed one another.

12:48.481 --> 12:49.709
There are contusions

12:49.782 --> 12:51.977
around the throat areas
ofthree men--

12:52.051 --> 12:53.746
evidence ofstrangulation.

12:53.820 --> 12:57.415
Richter and Campbell
killed themselves.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.924
l also found tissue damage
due to fever.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.483
Did any ofthem have

13:02.562 --> 13:05.360
the black spots the dog has?

13:05.431 --> 13:08.366
No. None ofthem had
the black nodules.

13:08.468 --> 13:11.699
So, uh, those spots
didn't have anything to do

13:11.804 --> 13:14.238
with those guys
killing each other, right?

13:14.307 --> 13:15.672
l wouldn't rule it out.

13:15.741 --> 13:17.368
l just reexamined the dog.

13:17.443 --> 13:18.842
The nodules are gone.

13:18.911 --> 13:20.276
What could that mean?

13:20.346 --> 13:23.838
lt could mean that the spots
are a symptom ofsome disease

13:23.916 --> 13:25.508
at an early stage.

13:54.647 --> 13:56.080
Danny?

13:56.149 --> 13:59.084
Danny.

13:59.152 --> 14:00.517
Danny.

14:00.586 --> 14:02.019
Sorry.

14:02.088 --> 14:04.215
The play-offgame
against Miami, '82.

14:04.290 --> 14:06.053
Helps to get my mind offstuff.

14:06.125 --> 14:09.185
My interpretation of
satellite remote sensing photos

14:09.262 --> 14:10.422
is a little rusty.

14:10.496 --> 14:14.330
Murphy: All right,
this is the lcy Cape area.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.060
lt approximates

14:16.169 --> 14:17.397
the depth ofthe ice sheet

14:17.503 --> 14:19.403
to be about 3,000 meters thick.

14:19.472 --> 14:20.666
l also found this data

14:20.773 --> 14:22.604
and ifl'm reading it correctly

14:22.675 --> 14:24.905
the team actually found
the ice sheet

14:24.977 --> 14:26.342
to be twice that depth.

14:26.412 --> 14:27.572
That's very good.

14:27.647 --> 14:28.739
The numbers indicate

14:28.814 --> 14:30.281
the topography to be concave.

14:30.349 --> 14:31.941
Looks like theywere drilling

14:32.018 --> 14:33.315
inside a meteor crater.

14:33.386 --> 14:36.116
Hodge: No, you're wrong.

14:36.189 --> 14:38.214
l analyzed two samples.

14:38.291 --> 14:40.054
What did you find?

14:40.126 --> 14:42.185
There's a presence
ofammonium hydroxide

14:42.261 --> 14:44.195
in Richter's blood sample.

14:44.263 --> 14:46.026
lt's not possible.

14:46.098 --> 14:48.589
Ammonia would vaporize
at human body temperature.

14:48.701 --> 14:50.430
l checked all
the air filtration systems.

14:50.536 --> 14:52.868
l found no evidence
ofany such toxins.

14:52.939 --> 14:54.634
l have.

14:54.707 --> 14:58.074
ln the ice,
and that's not all there is.

15:01.247 --> 15:03.681
l found a high ratio
ofammonia to water

15:03.749 --> 15:05.683
in the ice core.

15:05.751 --> 15:07.844
The earth's atmosphere could
never have produced such levels

15:07.920 --> 15:09.683
even a quarter
ofa million years ago.

15:09.755 --> 15:11.086
Look in the scope.

15:11.157 --> 15:13.091
Unless a foreign object

15:13.159 --> 15:15.286
was introduced
into that environment.

15:15.361 --> 15:18.228
Murphy: Tell me
that's not a foreign object.

15:18.297 --> 15:20.231
Scully.

15:23.769 --> 15:27.170
That same thing is
in Richter's blood.

15:28.407 --> 15:30.341
What ifthat single-celled organism

15:30.409 --> 15:33.537
is the larval stage
ofa larger animal?

15:35.948 --> 15:38.382
That's kind ofa leap,
don'tyou think?

15:38.451 --> 15:40.544
Scully:
The evidence is there.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.053
Maybe the organism

15:42.121 --> 15:44.248
in the ice core
somehow got into the men.

15:44.323 --> 15:46.291
Come on.
Nothing can survive

15:46.359 --> 15:48.384
in sub-zero temperatures
for a quarter million years.

15:48.461 --> 15:51.021
Mulder:
Unless that's how it lives.

15:51.097 --> 15:55.329
Why areyou squabbling
over some bug?

15:55.434 --> 15:57.163
You said ityourself, Scully.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.101
Your autopsy found
those men killed each other.

15:59.171 --> 16:02.197
That's it.
Let'sjust get the hell out ofhere.

16:02.308 --> 16:03.741
l agree.

16:03.809 --> 16:05.743
We'll send the bodies
to a facility

16:05.811 --> 16:08.302
where they can make
a definitive diagnosis.

16:08.381 --> 16:11.782
ln the event that something
was missed, Agent Scully.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.319
lfthose bodies are infected

16:14.387 --> 16:16.651
we can't take them back.

16:16.722 --> 16:18.747
We can't go back
without proper quarantine procedures.

16:18.824 --> 16:20.724
We can't risk bringing back
the next plague.

16:20.793 --> 16:23.455
Let's say
they came down with something.

16:23.529 --> 16:26.965
We haven't, and l ain't
waiting around until we do.

16:27.033 --> 16:29.729
l think it's safe to go back.

16:29.835 --> 16:31.769
There's no reason
whywe'd be infected.

16:31.837 --> 16:33.668
We took the necessary safeguards.

16:33.739 --> 16:35.070
The dog did bite Bear.

16:35.141 --> 16:36.608
ltjumped Mulder!

16:36.676 --> 16:38.974
There's only one way to proceed.

16:39.045 --> 16:41.147
A doctor eliminates
every possibility.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.147
We must determine
ifany ofus is infected.

16:48.054 --> 16:50.420
All right.
Parasitic diagnostic procedure

16:50.489 --> 16:54.323
requires that each ofus provide
a blood and a stool sample.

16:54.393 --> 16:56.554
A stool sample?

16:56.662 --> 16:59.825
This kind oftravel
always makes that tough... for me.

16:59.932 --> 17:02.492
Mulder:
Anybody got the morning

17:02.601 --> 17:04.262
sports section handy?

17:06.071 --> 17:08.869
l ain't dropping my cargo
for no one.

17:08.941 --> 17:10.602
What l'm doing is getting

17:10.675 --> 17:11.608
my gear, my plane

17:11.676 --> 17:13.541
and fying the hell out ofhere.

17:13.612 --> 17:16.172
You can't go.
The dog bityou.

17:16.248 --> 17:20.548
l got hired to fyyou up here
and fyyou back.

17:20.618 --> 17:22.746
No one said this might be
part ofthe deal.

17:22.821 --> 17:25.086
So the deal is over.

17:27.425 --> 17:28.961
Scully: We can't let him leave
without being checked.

17:28.961 --> 17:29.518
Scully: We can't let him leave
without being checked.

17:29.628 --> 17:31.858
Who's going to stop him?

17:31.964 --> 17:33.556
We have to.

17:33.666 --> 17:36.430
We can't risk infecting
the population.

17:36.502 --> 17:38.436
lfhe gets on that plane,
l will too.

17:38.504 --> 17:39.971
There's no time to argue.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.472
Take a vote.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.474
Who believes
we should confine Bear

17:43.542 --> 17:45.373
until he agrees
to an examination?

17:52.017 --> 17:53.814
All right.

17:56.055 --> 17:58.489
Bear, wejust want
to checkyou out.

17:58.557 --> 18:00.081
lfwe don't find any trace

18:00.159 --> 18:01.751
ofthe parasite or the virus

18:01.861 --> 18:03.089
we'll all go.

18:10.236 --> 18:13.103
All right.

18:13.172 --> 18:16.107
Give me the damnjar.

18:28.053 --> 18:29.577
Murphy, get a rope.

18:29.655 --> 18:31.589
(Bear Grunting)

18:33.959 --> 18:36.257
(Groaning)

18:38.931 --> 18:40.592
Oh, my God!

18:40.699 --> 18:42.166
(Groaning)

18:42.268 --> 18:43.701
Oh!

18:44.703 --> 18:46.330
Get my bag.

18:46.405 --> 18:47.531
What areyou gonna do?

18:47.606 --> 18:48.766
Cutting it out.

18:48.841 --> 18:50.274
We know nothing about it.

18:50.342 --> 18:51.707
lt's killing him.

18:51.777 --> 18:53.802
Scully, help me hold the skin.

18:57.616 --> 18:59.948
Hold still, Bear.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.010
(Screaming)

19:02.087 --> 19:04.282
Forceps.

19:04.356 --> 19:05.653
(Moaning)

19:08.360 --> 19:10.328
Hodge: Hold still, Bear.

19:10.396 --> 19:11.624
just another second.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.459
You're going to be okay.

19:14.567 --> 19:17.229
(Groaning)

19:17.303 --> 19:20.830
(Agonized Moaning)

19:40.025 --> 19:42.084
This is the A.l.C.P.
investigative team

19:42.161 --> 19:44.129
calling Doolittle Airfield.
Come in.

19:44.196 --> 19:45.925
D.A.F. responding.

19:46.031 --> 19:47.999
This is Agent Mulder.

19:48.067 --> 19:50.934
We have a serious
biological hazard.

19:51.003 --> 19:53.938
Request air pickup
and quarantine procedures.

19:54.006 --> 19:56.907
Come in, Doolittle Airfield.

19:56.976 --> 19:59.706
We copy.
Thisareais underaheavystorm.

19:59.778 --> 20:01.973
Noaircraftcangetout

20:02.047 --> 20:04.880
Maybe themilitarybasein Kotzebue

20:04.950 --> 20:06.884
Adviseimmediate evacuation.

20:06.952 --> 20:09.250
Thestorm isbearing
inyour direction.

20:09.321 --> 20:11.846
We were told
we'd have three clear days ofweather.

20:11.924 --> 20:15.223
Welcome to the top
ofthe world, sir.

20:15.327 --> 20:17.261
ls Bear in any condition to fy?

20:17.329 --> 20:19.126
lfwe don't get out ofhere
in an hour

20:19.231 --> 20:21.165
we don't get out for days.

20:24.837 --> 20:26.771
He's dead.

20:44.957 --> 20:46.857
Hodge: lt's similar to a tapeworm

20:46.926 --> 20:49.622
in that it has a scolex
with suckers and hooks.

20:49.728 --> 20:51.662
You can deal with it?

20:51.730 --> 20:53.664
What?

20:53.732 --> 20:55.165
No.

20:55.234 --> 20:56.997
Very different
from any organism--

20:57.069 --> 20:58.832
at least that l know of.

20:58.904 --> 21:01.429
Haveyou figured out
how it's transmitted yet?

21:01.507 --> 21:04.271
Exchange offuids, touch, air,
all ofthe above?

21:04.343 --> 21:05.776
l don't know.

21:05.844 --> 21:07.778
All the other dead bodies
had the creature.

21:07.846 --> 21:09.780
This is the only one
that's still alive.

21:09.848 --> 21:11.611
Were they all in the spine?

21:11.684 --> 21:15.176
No. lt appears theywere
in the hypothalamus gland

21:15.254 --> 21:17.119
deep in the brain.

21:17.189 --> 21:19.123
Murphy: Hypothalamus.

21:19.191 --> 21:21.091
What was that again?

21:21.160 --> 21:23.128
lt's a gland
that secretes hormones

21:23.195 --> 21:25.129
although l don't know why

21:25.197 --> 21:27.256
a parasite would want
to attach to it.

21:27.366 --> 21:30.130
Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine

21:30.202 --> 21:33.399
which is what produces
violent, aggressive behavior.

21:33.472 --> 21:35.406
That might be a connection.

21:35.474 --> 21:37.237
Everybody that's been infected

21:37.309 --> 21:40.142
certainly seems
to act aggressively.

21:40.212 --> 21:42.874
Maybe the worm feeds
on acetylcholine

21:42.948 --> 21:45.246
which foods our capacity
to control violent behavior.

21:45.317 --> 21:47.717
A parasite shouldn't want
to kill its host.

21:47.786 --> 21:50.448
lt doesn't kill you
until it's extracted.

21:50.522 --> 21:52.547
Then it releases a poison.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.183
You're saying it's possible

21:54.259 --> 21:57.126
the worm makes you
want to kill other people

21:57.229 --> 21:59.288
which is maybe what happened
to the first team.

21:59.398 --> 22:01.866
Orwhat could happen to us.

22:01.934 --> 22:04.198
lt'sjust a theory.
We don't have definite proof.

22:04.269 --> 22:06.203
Except five dead men.

22:06.271 --> 22:08.535
lfthe worm makes people
violently aggressive

22:08.607 --> 22:11.974
then why did Richter
and Campbell kill themselves?

22:12.044 --> 22:15.980
Maybe they did it
to save us.

22:31.930 --> 22:35.195
l'm just, uh...
double-checking.

22:35.267 --> 22:37.326
Making sure l didn't miss anything.

22:37.436 --> 22:40.837
just some sleep, right?

22:40.906 --> 22:44.342
Sleep. l'm so tired,
l can't sleep.

22:44.410 --> 22:46.674
We're all wired
and hypersensitive.

22:46.745 --> 22:49.179
lt will be good to get
a fresh start in the morning.

22:49.248 --> 22:51.182
l don't want to waste a second

22:51.250 --> 22:53.184
finding a way to kill this thing.

22:53.252 --> 22:56.278
l don't know
ifwe should kill it.

22:56.355 --> 22:59.882
This area ofthe ice sheet
is formed over a meteor crater.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.858
The worm lives in ammonia.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.190
lt survives sub-zero temperatures.

23:04.296 --> 23:06.856
Theorists in alternative life designs
believe in

23:06.965 --> 23:09.627
ammonia-supported life systems
on planets with freezing...

23:09.702 --> 23:10.794
No.

23:10.869 --> 23:12.894
The meteor that crashed here

23:12.971 --> 23:16.065
may have carried that type
oflife to earth.

23:16.141 --> 23:18.769
Mulder, that pilot
developed surface symptoms

23:18.844 --> 23:20.937
within a few minutes.

23:21.013 --> 23:24.915
Within a few hours
that parasite had total control.

23:24.983 --> 23:28.578
What would happen
ifthis got into the population?

23:28.654 --> 23:30.781
A city the size of New York

23:30.856 --> 23:33.825
could be infected
within a few days.

23:33.892 --> 23:37.350
Exactly.
But what do we know about it?

23:37.429 --> 23:39.488
This organism might be
lying dormant in another crater.

23:39.598 --> 23:42.863
lfwe don't kill it now,
we run the risk

23:42.935 --> 23:45.563
ofbecoming Richter and Campbell
with guns to our heads.

23:45.637 --> 23:47.901
lfwe kill it, we won't know

23:47.973 --> 23:49.964
how to stop anything like it
in the future.

23:50.042 --> 23:51.976
Scully: Future!

23:52.044 --> 23:55.639
(lndistinct Arguing)

24:01.587 --> 24:03.521
Tell me it's hot in here.

24:03.589 --> 24:05.523
Don't worry.
You don't have a fever.

24:05.591 --> 24:07.650
Heating system's malfunctioning.

24:07.726 --> 24:11.321
Outside, it's 40 below,
and in here it's sweltering.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.489
Can you hear
what they're arguing about?

24:13.599 --> 24:16.568
They're probably discussing
their little government secrets.

24:16.668 --> 24:19.569
You think they knew what was here
before we arrived?

24:19.638 --> 24:21.469
l'm sure ofit.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.735
Scully:
...biological hazard.

24:23.809 --> 24:27.336
You know, Bear's infected blood
did get on Scully.

24:27.412 --> 24:29.903
lt also got on you.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.349
How doyou know
it can't be contained?

24:39.424 --> 24:41.324
lt can!
By extermination.

24:41.393 --> 24:42.985
We should take
those bodies--

24:43.095 --> 24:45.655
worms and all--
outside and incinerate them.

24:45.764 --> 24:48.130
Something going on
we should know about?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.134
Agent Scully, you all right?

24:50.202 --> 24:52.636
Yes, l'm fine.
lt's nothing.

24:52.704 --> 24:55.434
You seem a little stressed out.

24:57.609 --> 24:59.406
What the hell
areyou saying?

24:59.478 --> 25:00.775
Let's all settle down.

25:00.846 --> 25:02.040
lt's been a hard day.

25:02.114 --> 25:03.672
We're all tired and scared.

25:03.749 --> 25:05.546
Let's not turn
on one another.

25:05.617 --> 25:08.450
At least not
without a good reason.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.715
Mulder: We should all
get some sleep.

25:10.789 --> 25:12.017
You kidding?

25:12.090 --> 25:14.786
You think any ofus
could sleep right now?

25:14.860 --> 25:16.623
Guys, let's face it--

25:16.728 --> 25:18.662
we got to check for spots.

25:18.730 --> 25:22.791
Any person or persons
who has them should be confined.

25:22.901 --> 25:24.869
Are we agreed on that?

25:24.970 --> 25:26.904
Areyou going to do the exams?

25:26.972 --> 25:28.564
No.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.870
We do them in front
ofeach other.

25:30.943 --> 25:32.205
No secrets.

25:37.516 --> 25:40.542
Before anyone passesjudgement,
may l remind you

25:40.619 --> 25:42.712
we are in the arctic.

26:11.550 --> 26:13.484
Sleep tight.

26:13.552 --> 26:15.315
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

26:15.387 --> 26:17.321
DaSilva: Yeah. Good night.

26:32.304 --> 26:33.828
Good night, Mulder.

26:34.907 --> 26:36.465
Good night, Scully.

26:36.541 --> 26:39.032
At least everyone's okay.

26:39.111 --> 26:41.045
Don't forget.

26:41.113 --> 26:43.946
The spots
on the dog went away.

27:37.602 --> 27:40.366
Ballon the three-yardline.

27:40.439 --> 27:43.840
Fourthandgoal with only 15seconds
leftin thegame.

27:43.909 --> 27:45.843
Hemoves overtheball.
Here's thesnap.

27:45.911 --> 27:47.344
Hegoes over...

28:30.122 --> 28:32.090
(Gasps)

28:40.098 --> 28:41.861
(Door Closes)

29:41.126 --> 29:43.356
(Barking)

30:00.445 --> 30:02.879
(Dripping)

30:26.872 --> 30:28.703
Mulder, what areyou doing?

30:28.773 --> 30:31.401
Murphy's dead.

30:32.444 --> 30:34.378
You killed him.

30:34.446 --> 30:36.778
l found him like this.

30:36.848 --> 30:38.782
l heard one ofthe doors close.

30:38.850 --> 30:40.977
l came out
to check it out.

30:41.052 --> 30:43.418
lt was one ofyou.

30:43.488 --> 30:45.422
You could have done it
and not known.

30:45.490 --> 30:46.855
He said he didn't.

30:46.958 --> 30:48.289
l have no symptoms.

30:48.393 --> 30:49.826
You checked him.

30:49.895 --> 30:51.123
Six hours ago.

30:51.229 --> 30:52.423
lt was one ofyou.

30:52.531 --> 30:54.999
Stop it!
Shut up!

30:55.867 --> 30:59.268
Put the gun down and let

30:59.337 --> 31:00.929
Hodge giveyou a blood test.

31:01.006 --> 31:02.598
He'll doctor the results.

31:02.674 --> 31:04.437
l won't let him
stick a needle in me.

31:04.509 --> 31:05.771
He has to be confined now.

31:05.844 --> 31:08.938
Turn around and let us
take a look atyour neck.

31:09.014 --> 31:10.606
l'm not turning
my back on anyone.

31:10.682 --> 31:13.242
As far as l'm concerned,
you're all infected!

31:13.318 --> 31:15.582
Hodge is right.
We ought to lock him up.

31:15.654 --> 31:16.848
Mulder...

31:16.922 --> 31:18.856
Scully, get that gun offme.

31:18.924 --> 31:20.448
You have to understand.

31:20.559 --> 31:21.491
Put it down!

31:21.560 --> 31:22.618
You first!

31:22.727 --> 31:23.751
Scully!

31:25.497 --> 31:27.692
For God's sakes, it's me.

31:27.766 --> 31:32.465
Mulder, you may not be
whoyou are.

31:57.996 --> 32:00.191
ln here l'll be safer than you.

33:03.795 --> 33:05.353
(Gasping)

33:05.463 --> 33:07.397
What wereyou doing?

33:07.465 --> 33:09.433
You know what l was doing.

33:09.501 --> 33:11.435
l can't help thinking,
Agent Scully

33:11.503 --> 33:13.437
you're the only one with a gun.

33:13.505 --> 33:15.837
lfyou get infected,
we don't stand a chance, do we?

33:26.418 --> 33:27.851
Okay.

33:38.630 --> 33:40.393
Was there something there?

33:40.465 --> 33:42.865
Hodge: You're okay, Nancy.

33:42.934 --> 33:44.458
We're all okay.

33:44.536 --> 33:46.470
Now is not the time
for the three ofus

33:46.538 --> 33:48.472
to break down
and turn on each other.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.303
There's four ofus.

33:50.375 --> 33:51.865
Mulder isn't one ofus.

33:51.943 --> 33:55.037
lf Mulder is infected,
it's not his fault.

33:55.113 --> 33:57.138
We can't turn our backs
on him now.

33:57.215 --> 33:59.149
He needs us to help him.

33:59.217 --> 34:00.411
She's right.

34:00.485 --> 34:01.747
Who knows

34:01.820 --> 34:03.754
what prolonged exposure
to the parasite could do?

34:03.822 --> 34:06.689
lt could damage him to the point
ofpermanent psychosis.

34:08.426 --> 34:11.156
lfhe is infected,
he doesn't go back.

34:11.262 --> 34:13.196
l won't risk
the possibilities.

34:24.242 --> 34:27.905
This is A.l.C.P.
calling Doolittle Airfield.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.275
Please come in.

34:29.347 --> 34:31.315
(Static)

34:33.083 --> 34:35.780
This is
the Arctic lce Corps Project

34:35.853 --> 34:38.254
sending a general distress call.

34:38.322 --> 34:39.688
Please respond.

34:39.757 --> 34:41.726
(Static)

34:58.843 --> 35:01.038
Nancy, put a drop
ofthe uninfected blood

35:01.112 --> 35:03.205
on the slide ofthe blood
drawn from the pilot.

35:03.281 --> 35:05.374
Run that by me again.

35:05.450 --> 35:09.887
Put the uninfected blood
on the infected blood.

35:17.662 --> 35:19.289
No! Damn it!

35:19.397 --> 35:21.262
What did l just tell you?

35:21.332 --> 35:23.266
You infected
already infected blood.

35:23.334 --> 35:25.268
We have to start over again.

35:25.336 --> 35:27.270
l made a mistake.
Don'tyell at me.

35:27.338 --> 35:28.771
Wasted hours ofwork.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.741
Maybeyou should do it byyourself!.
Damn it!

35:31.810 --> 35:34.074
l'm notyour assistant!

35:42.387 --> 35:44.651
Hodge.

35:44.722 --> 35:46.314
What?

35:46.391 --> 35:48.621
Come take a look at this.

35:51.029 --> 35:53.998
The larvae from two different worms
killed each other.

36:13.284 --> 36:15.411
An individual worm will not tolerate

36:15.487 --> 36:18.581
another invading its host.

36:18.656 --> 36:21.591
lt does to the invader
what it did to humans.

36:21.659 --> 36:23.251
lt makes them kill.

36:23.361 --> 36:27.229
Hodge: But the species needs
another to procreate.

36:27.298 --> 36:29.061
Worms are hermaphroditic.

36:29.133 --> 36:31.067
lt can reproduce itself.

36:31.135 --> 36:34.400
Look at the evidence
in the microscope.

36:34.472 --> 36:36.736
This thing does not like company.

36:36.808 --> 36:38.742
What areyou saying?

36:38.810 --> 36:40.437
The way to kill it

36:40.512 --> 36:42.104
is to introduce anotherworm

36:42.180 --> 36:44.444
into an already infected body?

37:23.521 --> 37:25.989
(Whining)

37:58.823 --> 38:00.654
lt sounds okay.

38:12.770 --> 38:15.034
lt passed the worms
in its stool.

38:15.106 --> 38:17.040
They're dead.

38:21.179 --> 38:23.113
l want to talk to him first.

38:23.181 --> 38:25.206
Try and make this voluntary.

38:25.283 --> 38:27.012
What?

38:27.085 --> 38:29.019
You can't go in alone.

38:29.087 --> 38:33.649
lfanything happens,
you come inside.

38:33.758 --> 38:36.454
l can't do this to him
until l'm sure.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.760
(Door Opening)

38:41.833 --> 38:43.300
lt'sjustyou?

38:43.401 --> 38:45.835
Yes.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.275
lt's one ofthem.

38:54.412 --> 38:57.381
No one's been killed
sinceyou've been in here.

38:57.482 --> 38:59.950
So?

39:02.353 --> 39:04.287
We found a way to kill it.

39:06.824 --> 39:10.590
Two worms in one host
will kill each other.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.499
You give me one worm,
you'll infect me.

39:18.569 --> 39:20.503
lfthat's true

39:20.571 --> 39:23.563
then why didn'tyou
let us inspectyou?

39:23.641 --> 39:27.202
l would have,
butyou pulled a gun on me.

39:27.311 --> 39:30.712
Now l don't trust them.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.114
l want to trustyou.

39:36.621 --> 39:38.384
Okay.

39:40.391 --> 39:43.417
But now they're not here.

40:31.342 --> 40:33.276
This is the last one.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.714
She's not going to let us
give it to him.

40:38.783 --> 40:41.149
Well, she'll have to
ifhe's infected.

40:41.219 --> 40:43.153
He'll convince her somehow.

40:50.962 --> 40:52.896
l just examined him.

40:52.964 --> 40:54.898
He's uninfected.

40:56.968 --> 40:59.198
So is she.

40:59.270 --> 41:01.795
Which means
that it must be one ofyou.

41:03.574 --> 41:04.700
All right.

41:04.809 --> 41:07.039
Let's go over
to the main building.

41:07.111 --> 41:09.341
l'd like to check him myself.

41:09.413 --> 41:12.746
Then he can examine both ofus.

41:12.817 --> 41:14.614
You want to lead the way?

41:22.426 --> 41:23.757
No!

41:45.716 --> 41:47.240
Get the worm.

41:57.094 --> 41:58.561
Don't!

42:01.599 --> 42:03.089
Oh, my God.

42:03.167 --> 42:05.032
(Screaming)

42:08.406 --> 42:10.033
lt's her!

42:10.141 --> 42:11.699
No!

42:11.809 --> 42:13.367
No!

42:15.847 --> 42:17.781
Scully!

42:17.849 --> 42:19.976
lt's DaSilva.

42:29.861 --> 42:32.591
(Screaming Hysterically)

42:38.002 --> 42:40.163
DaSilva: No!

42:45.910 --> 42:47.207
Hodge! Now!

42:47.278 --> 42:49.143
Mulder.

42:49.213 --> 42:51.647
After this,
there won't be any left.

42:51.716 --> 42:53.308
They're all going to be dead!

42:53.384 --> 42:54.817
Do it!

42:54.886 --> 42:56.114
(DaSilva Screaming)

42:56.187 --> 42:58.451
No!

42:58.522 --> 43:00.217
Shh, shh.

43:00.291 --> 43:01.690
No!

43:01.759 --> 43:03.522
Shh, shh.

43:03.594 --> 43:05.528
Shh, shh.

43:05.596 --> 43:07.530
(Moaning)

43:16.173 --> 43:18.107
lt's all right.

43:18.175 --> 43:20.769
lt's all over.

43:20.878 --> 43:22.971
lt all stops right here.

43:23.047 --> 43:25.481
Right now.

43:36.594 --> 43:38.528
Okay, lock her down.

43:41.966 --> 43:44.400
She's being put in quarantine
along with the dog.

43:44.468 --> 43:46.402
We'll keep her there
until we're sure

43:46.470 --> 43:49.064
she won't infect
the rest ofthe population.

43:49.173 --> 43:53.701
Our tests came back normal,
so we've been released.

43:53.811 --> 43:55.574
Plane ready.

43:55.646 --> 43:59.207
lt will takeyou as far
from the ice as you want to go.

43:59.283 --> 44:01.251
l'm going back to the site.

44:01.319 --> 44:03.253
This time l'm going fully prepared

44:03.321 --> 44:05.084
with proper equipment.

44:05.156 --> 44:07.784
There's a lot ofresearch to be done
on the genetic structure

44:07.858 --> 44:09.291
on its origins...

44:09.360 --> 44:10.793
Mulder, don'tyou know?

44:10.861 --> 44:12.726
Know what?

44:12.797 --> 44:16.255
45 minutes after they evacuated us
they torched the place.

44:16.334 --> 44:18.097
There's nothing left.

44:18.169 --> 44:19.898
Who did that?

44:19.971 --> 44:21.563
The military...

44:21.672 --> 44:23.401
the Center for Disease Control...

44:23.507 --> 44:25.236
you ought to know.

44:25.343 --> 44:27.277
They'reyour people.

44:32.550 --> 44:36.111
lt's still there, Scully.

44:36.187 --> 44:39.452
200,000 years down.

44:39.523 --> 44:41.923
ln the ice.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.594
Leave it there.
