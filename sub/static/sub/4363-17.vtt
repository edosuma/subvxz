WEBVTT

00:07.408 --> 00:10.681
I MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE. OLIVIA
AND ME, WE'RE--WE'RE STRUGGLING.

00:10.681 --> 00:14.045
DADDY AND I
LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH.

00:14.045 --> 00:17.488
BUT MOST OF ALL, WE LOVE YOU.
I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU SAW IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD.

00:17.488 --> 00:20.321
I WROTE A FORMULA
ON YOUR BEDROOM MIRROR,

00:20.321 --> 00:23.194
AND I THINK IT RELATES SOMEHOW
TO THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT.
YOU TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW,

00:23.194 --> 00:26.357
AND YOU CAN WALK OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW.
WHO ARE YOU?

00:26.357 --> 00:30.661
YOU ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.
YOU, AGENT BENFORD, YOU WILL
KILL AGENT NOH ON MARCH 15th

00:30.661 --> 00:33.634
WITH THE VERY GUN
YOU'RE CARRYING RIGHT NOW.

00:33.634 --> 00:37.808
I FILED THE PAPERWORK
TO DESTROY THE GUN.
THE BOX IS HERE,
BUT THE GUN IS GONE.

00:37.808 --> 00:41.672
(muffled shots fire)
(Vreede) DYSON FROST SHOT
A HOMELESS MAN WITH MARK'S GUN.

00:41.672 --> 00:43.774
(Wedeck) VREEDE,
I WANT YOU TO FIND THAT GUN.

00:43.774 --> 00:46.617
I THINK YOU KNOW MORE
THAN YOU'VE TOLD THE FBI,

00:46.617 --> 00:49.180
AND WHAT YOU DO KNOW IS SOMEHOW
RELATED TO DEMETRI'S DEATH.
WANT TO GET MARRIED TOMORROW?

00:49.180 --> 00:51.782
THEN WE GET ON A PLANE.
WE GO TO HAWAII.

00:51.782 --> 00:53.824
MAYBE WE DON'T EVER COME HOME.
(grunts)

00:53.824 --> 00:56.056
DYSON FROST--WHERE ARE WE?
(Mark) WE'RE CLOSING IN,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.329
BUT HE'S ALWAYS
ONE STEP AHEAD OF US.
(cell phone rings)

00:58.329 --> 01:02.062
AGENT BENFORD? DYSON FROST.
I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT COMING IN,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.535
but it's time we talk.
I'll be in touch.

01:04.535 --> 01:06.097
HELLO, CHARLIE.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.805
(breathing heavily)

01:46.837 --> 01:48.879
(Mark) OKAY, CHARLIE-BEAR,

01:48.879 --> 01:51.782
WE NEED YOU TO TELL US
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.
HE WAS TALL.

01:51.782 --> 01:54.515
AND DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HE WAS WEARING?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.517
A JACKET.

01:56.517 --> 01:59.690
(Janis)
AND WHAT COLOR WAS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

02:01.892 --> 02:05.196
DID HE HAVE GLASSES OR A WATCH
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

02:05.196 --> 02:06.657
I DON'T KNOW.

02:06.657 --> 02:08.659
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
IT'S OKAY.

02:08.659 --> 02:11.662
WE WOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU
IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.

02:11.662 --> 02:15.206
WHAT YOU SAY COULD
HELP US FIND DEMETRI.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.768
SHE KNOWS THAT, MARK.
SHE'S TRYING.

02:17.768 --> 02:21.212
(Wedeck) CHARLIE,
YOU'RE DOING REALLY GOOD.

02:21.212 --> 02:23.214
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES...

02:23.214 --> 02:25.316
CLOSING OUR EYES

02:25.316 --> 02:27.478
HELPS US REMEMBER MORE.

02:27.478 --> 02:29.280
YOU WANT TO DO THAT WITH ME?

02:29.280 --> 02:31.151
HMM?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.753
GOOD.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.655
COME ON.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.657
WHAT DO YOU SEE NOW?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.459
HE KNEW MY NAME.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.532
HELLO, CHARLIE.

02:41.532 --> 02:44.195
(Charlie) BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HE WAS.

02:44.195 --> 02:47.268
THEY MAKE A MEAN COTTON CANDY
HERE, DON'T THEY?

02:47.268 --> 02:50.841
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO STRANGERS.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.504
OH, WELL,
I'M NOT A STRANGER.

02:53.504 --> 02:56.607
IF I WERE A STRANGER,
WOULD I KNOW YOUR NAME?

02:56.607 --> 02:58.809
HMM?

02:58.809 --> 03:01.412
I WORK WITH YOUR DADDY,

03:01.412 --> 03:04.455
AND I HEAR THAT
YOU'RE A BIG READER.

03:04.455 --> 03:07.258
DO YOU LIKE DR. SEUSS?

03:07.258 --> 03:08.919
YEAH.

03:08.919 --> 03:10.561
ME, TOO.

03:10.561 --> 03:12.563
YOU KNOW, MY FAVORITE IS

03:12.563 --> 03:15.195
"ONE FISH TWO FISH
RED FISH BLUE FISH."

03:15.195 --> 03:17.868
THAT ONE IS FOR LITTLE KIDS.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.431
WELL, MAYBE.

03:20.431 --> 03:22.933
YOU KNOW, EVEN GROWN-UPS
CAN LEARN FROM THAT BOOK,

03:22.933 --> 03:25.936
'CAUSE DR. SEUSS
HAS ALL THE ANSWERS.

03:25.936 --> 03:27.778
I LIKE HORTON.

03:27.778 --> 03:30.210
HORTON?
OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE, TOO.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.842
I MEAN, HORTON'S A TROUPER--

03:31.842 --> 03:35.416
HAD FAITH TO CARRY HIS MISSION
THROUGH TO THE END

03:35.416 --> 03:37.848
EVEN WHEN OTHERS DOUBTED HIM.

03:37.848 --> 03:43.223
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE, I NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.999
I WANT YOU TO GIVE THIS
TO YOUR DADDY.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.832
NOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.565
OKAY?

03:54.565 --> 03:56.006
BYE-BYE.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.841
(Wedeck)
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

04:02.973 --> 04:04.875
THEN HE LEFT.

04:13.884 --> 04:16.787
WE SHOULD GET GOING.
WE'RE DONE, RIGHT?

04:16.787 --> 04:18.359
YOU DID GREAT.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.531
WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU.

04:24.535 --> 04:28.369
(door closes)

04:28.369 --> 04:30.501
SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW
ALL THE ANSWERS, DADDY.

04:30.501 --> 04:34.445
OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
COME HERE. YOU WERE FANTASTICO.
SWEETIE.

04:34.445 --> 04:37.348
(laughs)
HEY, YOU WERE A GREAT HELP.

04:37.348 --> 04:39.279
WE SHOULD GO.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.682
(sighs)
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.815
YEAH.

04:44.815 --> 04:47.017
(door opens)

04:47.017 --> 04:50.621
(clears throat)

04:50.621 --> 04:51.792
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN,
CHARLIE.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.494
YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.966
YOU KNOW, CHARLIE, THERE'S ONE
MORE THING YOU COULD DO FOR ME.

04:55.966 --> 04:58.929
I HAVE THIS JAR
OF JELLY BEANS ON MY DESK,

04:58.929 --> 05:01.001
AND I-I HATE JELLY BEANS.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.834
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
HATE JELLY BEANS, TOO--
I DON'T HATE JELLY BEANS.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.907
YOU DON'T HATE JELLY BEANS?
REALLY?

05:06.907 --> 05:10.010
WHY DON'T YOU COME
HELP ME OUT, THEN?
HELP HIM OUT.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.713
(laughs)
COME ON AND HELP ME OUT,
THEN WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.715
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE KIND?
(laughs)
I LIKE THE GREEN ONES.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.717
(Wedeck) I HATE THOSE.
THAT WAS FAST.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.018
SHE GOT SO BIG.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.890
YEAH.

05:19.890 --> 05:22.723
SHE SEEMS OKAY THOUGH,
RIGHT?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.955
I THINK SO...

05:24.955 --> 05:26.957
I MEAN,
AS FAR AS YOU CAN TELL

05:26.957 --> 05:29.930
WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THE MIND
OF A 6-YEAR-OLD.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.932
SHE NEEDS TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.535
I-I REALLY DON'T WANT THAT,
MARK.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.368
WELL, LOOK, WE HAVE A CHILD
PSYCHOLOGIST THAT WORKS HERE.

05:37.368 --> 05:39.740
WHY NOT CALL HER?
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
NEED THERAPY.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.743
SHE NEEDS STABILITY.
SHE NEEDS TO FEEL PROTECTED.

05:42.743 --> 05:46.016
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW THERE
AREN'T GOING TO BE SCARY MEN

05:46.016 --> 05:48.849
ASKING HER TO DELIVER
MESSAGES TO HER DAD.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.383
SHE THINKS YOU'RE GONNA DIE,
MARK.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.387
LOOK!

05:56.387 --> 05:59.490
HE LET ME HAVE
ALL THE GREEN ONES.
WOW.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.932
YES, HE DID.
DO YOU WANT ONE?
YEAH.

06:01.932 --> 06:03.794
CAN MOMMY HAVE ONE?
YEAH.

06:03.794 --> 06:05.496
NO, THANK YOU.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.768
LET'S GO, SWEETIE.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.040
(Zoey) ZOEY ANDATA
TO SEE ALDA HERTZOG.

06:11.942 --> 06:13.874
(exhales deeply)

06:17.408 --> 06:19.410
(woman) OFFICER STILLMAN
TO CELLBLOCK "D."

06:19.410 --> 06:22.913
OFFICER STILLMAN
TO CELLBLOCK "D."
(buzzer)

06:22.913 --> 06:24.915
ALDA, IT'S MARCH 15th,

06:24.915 --> 06:27.888
THE DAY THAT DEMETRI'S
SUPPOSED TO DIE...

06:27.888 --> 06:30.160
AND HE'S GONE MISSING.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.924
MAYBE HE'S JUST IN CABO
WITH HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.896
ALDA, SHUT UP.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.500
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING THAT YOU KNOW...

06:39.500 --> 06:42.032
EVERYTHING... RIGHT NOW.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.874
I ALREADY HAVE.

06:43.874 --> 06:46.106
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.740
THE ONLY REASON THAT
I AGREED TO REPRESENT YOU

06:49.740 --> 06:52.643
IS BECAUSE YOU SAID
THERE WAS MORE.

06:52.643 --> 06:55.916
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T CARE
IF DEMETRI LIVES OR IF HE DIES.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
BUT I THINK THAT YOU DO CARE

06:57.918 --> 06:59.920
ABOUT GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.892
ALDA, WE MADE A DEAL.

07:04.495 --> 07:07.698
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING...

07:09.129 --> 07:11.001
PLEASE.

07:13.063 --> 07:16.066
GET ME A HEARING
AND WE'LL TALK.

07:16.066 --> 07:19.570
I'VE BEEN HELD HERE FOR FIVE
MONTHS AS A MATERIAL WITNESS,

07:19.570 --> 07:22.172
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGED
WITH CRAP.

07:22.172 --> 07:24.174
I'M SICK OF IT.

07:24.174 --> 07:27.217
I KNOW. I APPLIED FOR
A HABEAS HEARING A MONTH AGO.

07:27.217 --> 07:30.581
YOU KNOW THIS. WE ARE
JUST WAITING FOR A COURT DATE.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.583
GUESS YOU SHOULD TRY
TO EXPEDITE THINGS.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.955
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT WE WOULD EVER BE ABLE

07:34.955 --> 07:37.488
TO GET A HEARING TODAY.
AND EVEN IF WE COULD,

07:37.488 --> 07:40.230
THERE'S NO JUDGE THAT WOULD BE
ABLE TO RELEASE YOU IN TIME.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.062
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING RELEASED?

07:42.062 --> 07:45.195
YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW ABOUT DEMETRI?

07:45.195 --> 07:48.168
GET ME A HEARING TODAY.

07:50.501 --> 07:53.173
(Wedeck) MARK'S GONNA MEET FROST
IN UNION STATION

07:53.173 --> 07:56.547
LIKE THE DRAWING SAID,
BUT I WANT HIM COVERED.

07:56.547 --> 07:59.750
WE'LL PICK HIM UP
ON THE WAY OUT.
IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT EASY.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.183
ALL THE TRAINS ARE STOPPED.
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET OUT.
FROST IS A GENIUS, A PLANNER.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.657
HE'S NOT GONNA WALK
INTO WHAT HE KNOWS IS A TRAP.
VREEDE, WHAT DO YOU GOT
ON THE PAINTING

08:06.657 --> 08:10.991
FROST USED TO SEND HIS MESSAGE?
"OEDIPUS AND THE SPHINX" BY
JEAN-AUGUSTE-DOMINIQUE INGRES,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.794
1808.
IS FROST TRYING TO TELL US
SOMETHING WITH THAT?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.266
IT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH.
WELL, HE MAY BE CRAZY,
BUT HE'S DELIBERATE.

08:16.266 --> 08:18.228
COULD BE MEANING
IN EVERYTHING HE DOES.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.971
WHY A CARNIVAL?
WHY DR. SEUSS? WHY OEDIPUS?

08:20.971 --> 08:24.975
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HIS MOTHER?
RIGHT. THAT, AND MAYBE HE'S
TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING

08:24.975 --> 08:27.908
ABOUT SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY.
BY TRYING TO ESCAPE HIS FATE,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.941
OEDIPUS SET INTO MOTION THE VERY
EVENTS HE WANTED TO AVOID.

08:30.941 --> 08:33.183
SO BY TRYING NOT TO GET SHOT
ON MARCH 15th,

08:33.183 --> 08:36.687
DEM JUST WALKED
INTO FROST'S TRAP?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YEAH.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.949
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
BY TRYING TO RESCUE HIM,

08:38.949 --> 08:41.752
WE'RE NOT GONNA
DO THE SAME THING

08:41.752 --> 08:44.254
AND END UP SEALING HIS FATE?
I DON'T.

08:44.254 --> 08:47.097
BUT I PROMISED DEMETRI
HE WASN'T GOING TO DIE TODAY,

08:47.097 --> 08:50.561
AND I'M KEEPING THAT PROMISE.

09:14.825 --> 09:18.228
(exhaling deeply)

09:18.228 --> 09:19.590
(beeping)

09:19.590 --> 09:22.162
(buzzer sounds, whirring)

09:24.264 --> 09:27.297
(beeping slows, whirring stops)

09:44.184 --> 09:46.757
THE MAN YOU'RE ABOUT TO MEET--

09:46.757 --> 09:48.619
HE'S BRILLIANT
BUT A LITTLE ECCENTRIC.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.621
WE HAD TO FAKE HIS DEATH
A WHILE BACK

09:50.621 --> 09:52.923
IN ORDER TO REMOVE HIM
FROM THE PUBLIC EYE,

09:52.923 --> 09:55.666
AND HE'S BEEN... DIFFICULT
EVER SINCE.
SO WHY RELY ON HIM?

09:55.666 --> 09:57.668
THERE ARE ONLY
A FEW PEOPLE ON EARTH

09:57.668 --> 10:00.070
WHO UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS
INVOLVED IN ALL THIS.

10:00.070 --> 10:03.073
HE'S ONE OF THEM. JUST KNOW THAT
IF HE GETS TOO UNMANAGEABLE,

10:03.073 --> 10:05.375
WE MAY ASK YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.377
SAY THE WORD
AND CONSIDER IT DONE.

10:07.377 --> 10:09.379
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU, ALDA--

10:09.379 --> 10:12.382
CLEAN, EFFICIENT
AND EAGER TO PLEASE.

10:12.382 --> 10:14.614
(door creaks)

10:20.851 --> 10:23.724
(Frost)
CAREFUL OF THE DOMINOS.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.909
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND,
HELLINGER?

10:38.909 --> 10:42.042
ALDA HERTZOG,
THIS IS DYSON FROST.

10:42.042 --> 10:45.676
DYSON HELPED US ENGINEER
THE RAVEN RIVER EXPERIMENTS.
HELPED YOU?

10:45.676 --> 10:47.678
(chuckles)

10:47.678 --> 10:49.049
I CREATED THEM.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.321
IN ANY EVENT,

10:51.321 --> 10:54.184
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING
PARTICIPANTS STILL ALIVE.

10:54.184 --> 10:57.127
SO... HOW ARE WE DOING?
ARE WE STILL ON SCHEDULE?

10:57.127 --> 11:00.130
OCTOBER 6th.

11:00.130 --> 11:03.133
I'VE SET UP
GLOBAL MONITORING STATIONS

11:03.133 --> 11:07.067
TO TRACK
THE WAVEFORM'S PROPAGATION.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.740
SO IF SIMCOE AND CAMPOS
FIND THEIR DARK MATTER,

11:09.740 --> 11:13.904
THEN WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

11:13.904 --> 11:15.706
IS THE Q.E.D. READY?

11:15.706 --> 11:18.909
THE FIRST ONE IS.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.914
THE REST WILL TAKE
A BIT MORE TIME.

11:23.914 --> 11:28.418
THAT'S ASTOUNDING. IT'S HARD
TO IMAGINE YOU'RE ABLE TO FIT

11:28.418 --> 11:31.922
THAT MUCH MICROCIRCUITRY
INTO SUCH A SMALL SPACE.

11:31.922 --> 11:34.224
WELL, I'M BRILLIANT, RIGHT?

11:34.224 --> 11:37.968
(click)
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
ON EARTH WHO UNDERSTAND

11:37.968 --> 11:41.101
THE PHYSICS INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS. HE'S ONE OF THEM.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.233
JUST KNOW THAT IF HE GETS
TOO UNMANAGEABLE,

11:43.233 --> 11:47.007
WE MAY ASK YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.
I PROMISE YOU THAT
WHEN THE TIME COMES,

11:47.007 --> 11:51.481
I'LL BE HALF A DOZEN MOVES
AHEAD OF YOU.
WELL, LET'S HOPE THAT TIME
DOESN'T COME, THEN.

11:51.481 --> 11:54.114
YOU CAN GO NOW.

11:57.047 --> 11:58.148
(sighs)

11:59.419 --> 12:04.394
I JUST HAVE TO ASK--
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE DOMINOS?

12:04.394 --> 12:07.497
THIS IS MY GARDEN...

12:07.497 --> 12:12.362
AND THE WHITE ONES CHART
THE PATH OF MY ESCAPE.

12:12.362 --> 12:14.364
(chuckles)

12:14.364 --> 12:16.867
THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.

12:16.867 --> 12:20.070
IT DOES IF YOU LIVE
IN MY HEAD.

12:32.082 --> 12:34.925
(exhales deeply)

12:34.925 --> 12:36.356
(clatter)

12:36.356 --> 12:37.888
(Frost) CAREFUL.

12:37.888 --> 12:41.431
YOU MOVE TOO MUCH,
THE GUN WILL FIRE.

12:44.334 --> 12:47.237
I CALL IT THE GARDEN
OF FORKING PATHS.

12:47.237 --> 12:50.070
ALL THOSE LINES--

12:50.070 --> 12:52.072
THEY'RE FUTURES
THAT BRANCH OFF

12:52.072 --> 12:54.975
OF EACH CRITICAL DECISION
I MADE.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.907
(rattling)

12:56.907 --> 12:58.909
FOR ME IT STARTED
BACK IN THE '80s--

12:58.909 --> 13:01.211
A PLACE CALLED RAVEN RIVER.

13:01.211 --> 13:03.413
WE ENGINEERED HUNDREDS--

13:03.413 --> 13:06.786
EVEN--EVEN THOUSANDS
OF FLASH-FORWARDS.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.420
SOMETIMES WE JUMP 20 MINUTES.
SOMETIMES WE JUMP 20 YEARS.

13:10.420 --> 13:14.464
BUT EVERY TIME WE JUMPED, WE SAW
A DIFFERENT POSSIBLE FUTURE.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.997
TAKE THE DAY OF THE BLACKOUT.

13:16.997 --> 13:21.271
HAD WE FAILED, A DIFFERENT PATH
WOULD HAVE OPENED UP.

13:21.271 --> 13:24.935
WE SUCCEEDED, SO WE MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT DECISION POINT--

13:24.935 --> 13:28.979
A NEW PATH,
WHICH BRINGS US TO TODAY--

13:28.979 --> 13:31.511
MARCH 15th--

13:31.511 --> 13:33.944
THE MOST IMPORTANT FORK
OF ALL.

13:33.944 --> 13:35.946
WHAT, MY MURDER?

13:35.946 --> 13:37.447
NO.

13:37.447 --> 13:40.450
OUR MURDER.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.553
YOU SEE,
THE THING IS, DEMETRI,

13:43.553 --> 13:46.256
IN ALMOST EVERY FUTURE,

13:46.256 --> 13:48.258
I DON'T LIVE PAST TODAY.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.301
78% OF THE TIME,
YOU END UP KILLING ME.

13:51.301 --> 13:52.832
WHY?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.834
AH, SELF-DEFENSE,
STUPIDITY, BAD LUCK--

13:54.834 --> 13:56.907
I COULD CONSTRUCT
A HUNDRED SCENARIOS.

13:56.907 --> 14:00.040
THE POINT IS,
ONCE WE'VE GLIMPSED IT,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.143
THE FUTURE WANTS TO HAPPEN.
IT GAINS WEIGHT.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.345
IT'S LIKE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE
BEARING DOWN.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
AND IF WE WANT
TO ESCAPE THAT PRESSURE,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.619
WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING DRASTIC.

14:09.619 --> 14:12.522
WHY THE DEATH TRAP?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL ME NOW?

14:12.522 --> 14:16.186
WHY EVEN BOTHER
USING MARK'S GUN?
I'M ATTEMPTING TO CONFORM
TO THE PREDICTED FUTURE

14:16.186 --> 14:20.160
AS CLOSELY AS I CAN WHILE STILL
ALLOWING FOR THE POSSIBILITY

14:20.160 --> 14:22.532
THAT WE BOTH MIGHT LIVE.

14:22.532 --> 14:26.066
I WANT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD,
AND YOU'RE MY INSURANCE.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.268
WELL,
THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.201
TWO BIRDS, ONE GUN.
(chuckles)

14:31.201 --> 14:33.543
YOU'RE INSANE.

14:33.543 --> 14:37.247
MOST ORACLES ARE, YOU KNOW?

14:37.247 --> 14:39.279
THEY--THEY SEE THE FUTURE,

14:39.279 --> 14:43.153
AND THE KNOWLEDGE
ENDS UP DESTROYING THEM.

14:43.153 --> 14:45.185
(rattling)

14:45.185 --> 14:48.218
WELL, I'M GOING NOW.

14:48.218 --> 14:51.221
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU SAID YOU
WANT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD,

14:51.221 --> 14:53.563
YOU WANT TO SHARE
WHAT YOU KNOW. COME ON.

14:53.563 --> 14:55.996
COME IN FROM THE COLD!
SHARE WHAT YOU KNOW!
(buzzer sounds, whirring)

14:55.996 --> 14:58.969
CAREFUL.
(beeping)

14:58.969 --> 15:01.601
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, DEMETRI.

15:01.601 --> 15:06.336
BUT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,
ONE OF US WILL DIE TODAY.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.043
COME ON. COME BACK.

15:13.043 --> 15:15.445
DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK OUT
THIS WAY, MAN.

15:15.445 --> 15:18.048
YOU HEAR ME?!

15:18.048 --> 15:20.120
YOU COME BACK!

15:20.120 --> 15:23.123
(beeping continues)

15:23.123 --> 15:26.556
(train horn blows)

15:26.556 --> 15:29.629
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

15:39.269 --> 15:42.272
(indistinct conversations)

15:52.122 --> 15:56.526
(Wedeck) Bishop One,
how's it going?
WE'VE CLONED THE STATION'S CCTVs
FOR MAXIMUM COVERAGE.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.688
But so far,
no sign of Frost.

15:58.688 --> 16:00.460
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T SPOOK HIM.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.033
We're being discreet, sir.
I promise.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.165
(man) LAST CALL.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CALL

16:05.165 --> 16:08.068
FOR THE NUMBER 2 TRAIN
DEPARTING FROM TRACK 10.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.369
LAST CALL
FOR THE NUMBER 2 TRAIN.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.271
(whirring)

16:17.177 --> 16:20.110
(Janis) Bishop One,
this is Bishop Four.

16:20.110 --> 16:22.012
I see white male
in a green army jacket,

16:22.012 --> 16:24.454
APPROACHING KINGMAKER.

16:24.454 --> 16:26.316
ANNOUNCING A TRACK CHANGE
FOR TRAIN NUMBER 7.

16:26.316 --> 16:28.318
NOW ARRIVING ON TRACK 3.

16:28.318 --> 16:31.091
TRAIN NUMBER 7
ARRIVING AT TRACK 3.

16:31.091 --> 16:35.125
(Janis) Disregard.
He's moving on.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.227
(indistinct conversations)

16:41.331 --> 16:44.234
WELL, THAT WAS THE FASTEST
CHOLECYSTECTOMY I'VE EVER SEEN.

16:44.234 --> 16:46.706
TRYING TO CATCH UP.
I GOT A LATE START

16:46.706 --> 16:49.179
AND A BOARD FULL
OF ELECTIVE CASES.

16:49.179 --> 16:52.342
HEY, MANEESH, WHAT INHALED
ANESTHETIC DID YOU USE?
SEVOFLURANE.

16:52.342 --> 16:55.715
DOES ANYONE USE
HALOTHANE ANYMORE?
IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MAYBE,

16:55.715 --> 16:58.718
BUT HERE IT'S PRETTY MUCH BEEN
REPLACED BY NEWER AGENTS.

16:58.718 --> 17:04.023
SO, UH, WHY THE SUDDEN INTEREST
IN OLD-SCHOOL ANESTHESIA?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.555
OH, IT'S COMPLICATED.

17:05.555 --> 17:09.199
THERE'S THIS FORMULA
THAT LLOYD SHOWED ME.

17:09.199 --> 17:12.332
LLOYD? LLOYD SIMCOE?

17:12.332 --> 17:15.435
YEAH. HE THINKS IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE BLACKOUT.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.707
SO YOU'RE, UH,
TALKING TO HIM AGAIN.
(water running)

17:17.707 --> 17:20.340
ANYWAY, HE THINKS
THE FORMULA FOR HALOTHANE

17:20.340 --> 17:22.342
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.244
OH. INTERESTING.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.546
YEAH. CAN YOU MEET ME
IN THE P.I.C.U.?
YEAH.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.180
I NEED TO CANNULATE
A KID FOR E.C.M.O. OKAY.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.422
I KNEW YOU'D GET
A SAME DAY HEARING

17:32.422 --> 17:35.425
IF YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT.
(man) HOLD HERE, PLEASE.

17:35.425 --> 17:39.329
IS APPENDICITIS SUPPOSED TO HURT
ON THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT?
(buzzer sounds)

17:39.329 --> 17:42.532
(metal door opens)
(lowers voice) ALDA, PLEASE.
I COULD GET DISBARRED FOR THIS.

17:42.532 --> 17:47.137
MM. LOST JOB, DEAD BOYFRIEND.
HARD CHOICE.
(buzzer sounds)

17:47.137 --> 17:50.500
YOU ARRANGE FOR
ALL THESE EXTRA MARSHALS?

17:50.500 --> 17:54.644
YOU MUST THINK
I'M A REALLY BIG CHEESE.
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART.

17:54.644 --> 17:56.576
THIS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE

17:56.576 --> 17:58.508
FOR ALL OF MY LYING,
PSYCHOPATHIC CLIENTS.

17:58.508 --> 18:01.080
SO JUST STAY QUIET
AND FOLLOW MY LEAD.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.184
OH, I'LL BE GOOD.
I PROMISE.

18:04.184 --> 18:07.217
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

18:09.189 --> 18:10.560
DR. BENFORD?

18:10.560 --> 18:13.163
WHAT'S HAPPENED?
IS MARK OKAY?

18:13.163 --> 18:17.267
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT A MURDER.

18:17.267 --> 18:20.370
AS A PART OF THE INVESTIGATION
INTO DEM'S DISAPPEARANCE,

18:20.370 --> 18:23.133
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE SHOOTING
OF A HOMELESS MAN

18:23.133 --> 18:26.276
IN A SHELTER DOWNTOWN. HE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY FORMAL I.D. ON HIM.

18:26.276 --> 18:29.439
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH DEMETRI?
MARK'S GUN WAS USED
IN THAT MURDER,

18:29.439 --> 18:32.442
AND WE HAVE REASON THE BELIEVE
THAT THE MAN WHO TOOK DEMETRI

18:32.442 --> 18:34.584
HAS THAT GUN NOW.
OKAY.

18:34.584 --> 18:37.116
WE WERE HOPING THAT
IF WE COULD I.D. THE GUY,

18:37.116 --> 18:39.118
WE MIGHT UNCOVER
A CONNECTION TO FROST

18:39.118 --> 18:41.251
THAT WOULD LEAD US TO HIM.
SO ONCE YOU FIND FROST,
YOU'LL FIND DEMETRI.

18:41.251 --> 18:43.393
RIGHT. I WENT THROUGH
THE VICTIM'S STUFF

18:43.393 --> 18:45.525
AND, UH, FOUND
A DISPOSABLE CELL PHONE.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.528
THE PHONE HAD AN OLD TEXT
MESSAGE SENT TO YOUR NUMBER.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.801
MY NUMBER? WHY WOULD HE
POSSIBLY HAVE MY NUMBER?

18:51.801 --> 18:55.335
WELL, IT WAS FROM OCTOBER.
THE CONTENTS WERE SENSITIVE.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.467
(whoosh)

18:57.467 --> 19:00.770
IT SAID, "MARK WAS DRINKING
IN HIS FLASH-FORWARD."

19:02.842 --> 19:04.674
WOULD YOU MIND...

19:04.674 --> 19:07.847
JUST COMING DOWN TO THE MORGUE
AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE BODY?

19:07.847 --> 19:10.750
YOU MUST KNOW
THIS MAN SOMEHOW.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.883
YEAH, I'M SURE I DON'T.

19:13.883 --> 19:15.885
WELL, HE KNEW YOU,

19:15.885 --> 19:19.389
AND ANYTHING YOU KNOW
COULD HELP DEMETRI.

19:19.389 --> 19:22.392
LET ME CHANGE.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.434
(train horn blares in distance)

19:24.434 --> 19:27.437
(indistinct conversations)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.701
All Bishops, I have
an African-American boy,

19:31.701 --> 19:34.904
BLUE SHIRT, SUPERMAN BACKPACK,
APPROACHING KINGMAKER.

19:34.904 --> 19:37.447
ARE YOU MARK BENFORD?

19:37.447 --> 19:39.449
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:39.449 --> 19:41.881
SOME WEIRD GUY PAID ME $50
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

19:49.359 --> 19:51.921
(Janis)
Something's going down.

19:51.921 --> 19:53.923
Bishop Five, pick up that kid

19:53.923 --> 19:56.826
OUTSIDE THE WEST ENTRANCE
FOR QUESTIONING.
(man) Bishop 5, 10-4.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.571
(cell phone rings)

20:01.571 --> 20:02.902
YEAH?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.974
(Frost) Don't speak.
I know they're watching you.

20:04.974 --> 20:08.278
BUT THEY CAN'T HEAR WHAT
I'M SAYING, SO JUST LISTEN.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.680
I've got Demetri, and I'll
kill him if you don't do

20:10.680 --> 20:12.712
exactly what I say.
CRANK IT UP.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.846
ALL I HEAR IS AMBIENT NOISE.
I want to come in,
and I can tell you when

20:16.846 --> 20:19.949
AND WHY THE NEXT BLACKOUT
WILL OCCUR.

20:19.949 --> 20:22.492
I want to help you,
but because I've parted ways

20:22.492 --> 20:24.924
with my associates,
they're gonna do anything

20:24.924 --> 20:28.528
TO ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T
BRING ME IN TO CUSTODY.
LISTEN, WE CAN PROTECT YOU.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.959
DON'T SPEAK!

20:29.959 --> 20:32.001
You speak again,
and Demetri's dead.

20:32.001 --> 20:35.305
IF YOU UNDERSTAND,
SAY "FIGUEROA."

20:35.305 --> 20:38.538
FIGUEROA.
(Wedeck)
He just said "Figueroa."

20:38.538 --> 20:41.240
IT COULD BE FIGUEROA STREET
IN DOWNTOWN L.A.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.873
(Frost) That should misdirect
your friends a bit.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.546
Now I'm gonna direct you
to a new location

20:46.546 --> 20:48.548
WHERE WE'LL MEET FACE-TO-FACE

20:48.548 --> 20:50.580
AND DISCUSS THE TERMS
OF MY SURRENDER.

20:50.580 --> 20:54.854
When I hang up the phone,
this is what you're going to do.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.757
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE. I WANT
A TAP ON THAT CELL PHONE NOW!
We're scanning frequencies,
sir,

20:57.757 --> 21:01.691
BUT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY
IN THE STATION.
MARK CAN DRAW HIM OUT, SIR. WE
JUST NEED TO GIVE HIM SOME TIME.

21:01.691 --> 21:03.993
(Wedeck) Time is the one thing
we don't have.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.836
Now, Mark, if all
my directions are understood,

21:06.836 --> 21:08.798
SAY... "PICO."

21:08.798 --> 21:10.940
PICO.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.643
HE SAID PICO AND FIGUEROA.
(typing)

21:13.643 --> 21:16.506
ALL RIGHT. I WANT TWO S.W.A.T.
TEAMS TO THE INTERSECTION

21:16.506 --> 21:19.949
OF PICO AND FIGUEROA.
Perfect. And that number
that I jotted down

21:19.949 --> 21:21.881
on the back of the Polaroid?

21:21.881 --> 21:25.355
Set your watch
to count back from it.
(beeps)

21:25.355 --> 21:27.657
NOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG DEMETRI
HAS LEFT TO LIVE.

21:27.657 --> 21:30.420
Start running, Mark.
We'll see each other soon.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.825
(Wedeck) What's he doing?
What's he doing?
(man) Where's he going?

21:35.825 --> 21:37.897
(man) We're all eyes on Benford.
He's leaving the concourse.
WE CAN'T LOSE HIM.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.870
GO!
(Frost) REMEMBER
THESE INSTRUCTIONS--

21:40.870 --> 21:43.633
RUN TO THE MEN'S ROOM.
THROW THE PHONE AWAY.

21:43.633 --> 21:45.775
IF YOU BRING A WEAPON,
DEMETRI WILL DIE.
(clatter)

21:50.840 --> 21:52.782
THERE'S A PANEL.

21:52.782 --> 21:55.515
INSIDE YOU'LL FIND
A ZOOMCAR ACCESS CARD.

21:58.348 --> 22:00.950
HE'S NOT HERE.
(Janis) WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?

22:21.611 --> 22:24.544
(cell phone rings)

22:24.544 --> 22:26.546
(ring)

22:26.546 --> 22:30.019
I'M HERE.
Start driving north. I'll give
you directions on the way.

22:30.019 --> 22:31.951
(tires screech)

22:34.954 --> 22:38.888
(Wedeck) What the hell
is going on out there?

22:38.888 --> 22:40.960
HE'S RUNNING.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.140
YOUR HONOR, IT IS IMPERATIVE
TO MS. HERTZOG'S WELL-BEING

22:51.140 --> 22:53.873
THAT THE METROPOLITAN
DETENTION CENTER

22:53.873 --> 22:55.875
ORDER A C.A.T. SCAN
ON HER CLEARLY DISTENDED

22:55.875 --> 22:58.648
AND PAINFUL ABDOMEN.
MS. ANDATA,
THE DOCTOR ON CALL AT M.D.C.

22:58.648 --> 23:00.950
EXAMINED MS. HERTZOG
NOT ONCE BUT TWICE.

23:00.950 --> 23:03.913
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
YES, THAT IS CORRECT,
YOUR HONOR, BUT--

23:03.913 --> 23:05.815
AND HE'S FOUND NO EVIDENCE
OF APPENDICITIS

23:05.815 --> 23:07.817
IN EITHER
OF THOSE EXAMINATIONS.

23:07.817 --> 23:09.789
NOW CORRECT ME IF I'M
MISREADING THE RECORDS.
NO, JUDGE SANDOZ--

23:09.789 --> 23:12.592
I AM MISREADING THINGS?
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.795
BUT APPENDICITIS IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR OVER 20,000 DEATHS

23:15.795 --> 23:17.797
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE,
AND I--

23:17.797 --> 23:20.029
THAT'S SOME VERY NICE RESEARCH,
MS. ANDATA,

23:20.029 --> 23:22.902
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT RELEVANT
TO YOUR MOTION,

23:22.902 --> 23:24.874
WHICH IS HEREBY DENIED.
AND, MS. ANDATA,

23:24.874 --> 23:27.106
I SUGGEST YOU THINK TWICE
BEFORE YOU BRING

23:27.106 --> 23:29.979
ANOTHER FRIVOLOUS CLAIM
INTO MY COURTROOM.

23:29.979 --> 23:33.583
I WILL IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON
ATTORNEYS WHO ABUSE THE PROCESS.

23:33.583 --> 23:36.886
UNDERSTOOD, YOUR HONOR.
THANK YOU.

23:36.886 --> 23:38.748
(gavel bangs)

23:40.820 --> 23:42.652
I'M SORRY.

23:42.652 --> 23:45.625
DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED.
I DIDN'T SAY WE HAD TO WIN.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.457
THEN TELL ME.
WHERE'S DEMETRI?

23:47.457 --> 23:49.959
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

23:49.959 --> 23:53.432
I HEARD THEY FOUND HIS BODY
IN BUILDING SEVEN.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.936
BUILDING SEVEN? WHAT--
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

23:56.936 --> 24:01.671
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?
YOU'RE A SMART GIRL. I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

24:01.671 --> 24:04.844
BUT RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT
SOMEWHERE ELSE I NEED TO BE.
(explosion)

24:04.844 --> 24:06.145
AAH!

24:08.147 --> 24:09.448
(alarm sounding)

24:09.448 --> 24:11.721
(grunts)

24:15.525 --> 24:18.157
(man) HOLDING CELL 4. WE GOT
A BREACH IN HOLDING CELL 4.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.160
(Frost) ALL RIGHT, MARK.
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE DEMETRI,

24:21.160 --> 24:24.564
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME TO ME ALONE.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.597
HEAD NORTH ON HIGHWAY 57
INTO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY.

24:27.597 --> 24:30.139
AT THE 31st MILE MARKER,
YOU'RE GONNA TURN RIGHT

24:30.139 --> 24:32.542
ON AN UNMARKED DIRT ROAD.

24:32.542 --> 24:36.045
FOLLOW THE ROAD 5 MILES
TILL IT COMES TO AN END.

24:36.045 --> 24:40.550
I LEFT A COMPASS FOR YOU
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

24:40.550 --> 24:42.912
GET A BEARING NORTH
AND START WALKING TOWARDS

24:42.912 --> 24:45.715
THE TEHACHAPI MOUNTAINS
FOR 1 MILE.

24:45.715 --> 24:50.019
IF YOU MAKE ANY OUTGOING CALLS,
OR IF ANYONE FOLLOWS YOU,

24:50.019 --> 24:52.992
DEMETRI WILL DIE.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.902
NO DENTAL RECORDS,
NO IDENTIFYING SCARS.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.835
EVEN HIS FINGERPRINTS
WERE SCRUBBED OFF.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.106
SCRUBBED OFF?

25:07.106 --> 25:10.079
THIS GUY DEFINITELY DID
NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.281
COME ON, MAN.
THROW US A BONE, HUH?

25:12.281 --> 25:14.614
IS THERE ANYTHING
DISTINCT HERE OR UNUSUAL?

25:14.614 --> 25:18.147
DEMETRI IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
WELL, THERE IS THIS.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.890
LOOK AT THE LIMBIC SYSTEM--
HUGE HIPPOCAMPUS.

25:20.890 --> 25:23.022
I'M THINKING OUR JOHN DOE
COULD HAVE BEEN

25:23.022 --> 25:25.855
SOME KIND OF SAVANT.
SAVANT.

25:25.855 --> 25:28.097
SAVANTS CAN DEVELOP
AN ENLARGED HIPPOCAMPUS

25:28.097 --> 25:31.901
RELATED TO THEIR INCREDIBLE
MEMORY CAPACITY.
(Vreede) WHAT, LIKE
A "RAIN MAN" SORT OF THING?

25:31.901 --> 25:35.665
EXACTLY.
YEAH, NO, I'M SORRY. I'VE NEVER
SEEN THIS MAN IN MY LIFE.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.567
YOU SURE?
MM-HMM.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.569
WELL, THERE'S A BOX
OF STUFF WE FOUND

25:39.569 --> 25:42.572
UNDER HIS BED IN THE SHELTER.
IT HAD AN ADDRESS BOOK IN IT.

25:42.572 --> 25:44.944
PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THERE THAT'LL EXPLAIN

25:44.944 --> 25:47.747
HIS CONNECTION TO YOU.
I'D DO ANYTHING
TO HELP DEMETRI,

25:47.747 --> 25:50.279
BUT I'M NOT CONNECTED TO HIM.
OLIVIA, YOU ARE.

25:50.279 --> 25:52.782
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW HOW.

25:52.782 --> 25:56.956
(bird screeching in distance)

26:08.037 --> 26:10.940
(panting)

26:36.926 --> 26:40.730
SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN, MARK.

26:40.730 --> 26:44.874
TIME FOR YOU AND ME
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.680
(cocks gun)

26:58.017 --> 27:01.390
YOU GOT MY MESSAGES
AND FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS.

27:01.390 --> 27:04.824
I'M IMPRESSED.
SO I'M FLATTERED.
WHERE'S DEMETRI?

27:04.824 --> 27:07.697
MOST OF MY ASSOCIATES
WANTED YOU DEAD MONTHS AGO.

27:07.697 --> 27:09.899
BUT I RESISTED

27:09.899 --> 27:13.032
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE
THINGS THROUGH TO THIS DAY.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.365
WHY ME?
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST
THE REST OF THE FBI.

27:16.365 --> 27:18.968
NOR SHOULD YOU.
WE FOUND A MOLE.

27:18.968 --> 27:22.311
(laughs) AND YOU THINK
THAT MAKES YOU SAFE?

27:22.311 --> 27:24.814
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

27:24.814 --> 27:28.247
HERE.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.850
PUT THOSE ON,
AND WE'LL TALK.

27:37.987 --> 27:41.260
MIND IF I HAVE
A LITTLE WATER FIRST?
BE MY GUEST.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.934
AT THIS POINT, IT'S DEMETRI'S
MINUTES YOU'RE BURNING.

27:46.936 --> 27:49.799
(spits and grunts)
(gunshot)

27:49.799 --> 27:53.072
GASOLINE! IT BURNS!

27:53.072 --> 27:55.104
SIPHONED FROM THE GAS TANK.
AAH!

27:55.104 --> 27:57.676
GET UP!
UHH!

27:57.676 --> 28:01.350
NO MORE GAMES, FROST.
WHERE'S DEMETRI?

28:01.350 --> 28:05.414
THIS IS NOT THE WAY IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO PLAY OUT!

28:07.416 --> 28:09.989
YEAH, BUILDING SEVEN.
THAT'S IT?

28:09.989 --> 28:12.792
THERE'S GOTTA BE AT LEAST
A MILLION BUILDING SEVENS

28:12.792 --> 28:14.924
IN ALL OF LOS ANGELES,
AND HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW

28:14.924 --> 28:16.966
IT IS LOS ANGELES?
I'LL RUN IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

28:16.966 --> 28:19.268
AND OF COURSE, ALDA COULD BE
LYING. DEMETRI TOLD ME--
(computer beeps, typing)

28:19.268 --> 28:22.972
HE WARNED ME ABOUT--
ZOEY, STOP. SIT, PLEASE.

28:22.972 --> 28:26.205
I'M GONNA HAVE JANIS
FLAG EVERY BUILDING SEVEN

28:26.205 --> 28:30.109
IN THE VICINITY OF YOUR HOUSE,
THE FBI AND THE WEDDING CHAPEL.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.382
WE'LL START THERE, AND WE'LL
KEEP SWEEPING UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

28:33.382 --> 28:38.017
HOW? HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY DO THAT IN TIME?

28:38.017 --> 28:44.153
WE HAVE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
SEARCH TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD

28:44.153 --> 28:48.127
AND A TEAM OF AGENTS WHO WON'T
REST UNTIL HE'S BACK SAFELY.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.860
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.432
LISTEN TO ME! I'M TIRED
OF PLAYING AROUND, FROST!

28:53.432 --> 28:57.867
WHERE'S DEMETRI?
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHERE HE IS!
I GAVE CHARLIE ALL THE ANSWERS!

28:57.867 --> 28:59.869
YOU GAVE MY CHARLIE
THE ANSWERS?!

28:59.869 --> 29:02.011
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:04.273 --> 29:06.515
GET UP. GET UP. GET UP!

29:06.515 --> 29:08.878
START WALKING.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

29:08.878 --> 29:12.021
I KNOW!
THE WHOLE WORLD IS!

29:12.021 --> 29:13.823
QUIET. WALK!

29:13.823 --> 29:16.255
BUT IN THE END,
YOU'RE GONNA BE SAVED

29:16.255 --> 29:18.888
BY THE LADY
YOU SEE EVERY DAY.

29:18.888 --> 29:21.991
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HUH? WHAT? START WALKING.

29:21.991 --> 29:26.165
LISTEN! LISTEN CAREFULLY TO
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.397
MOVE!

29:30.199 --> 29:33.042
SOMEONE FOLLOWED YOU HERE.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.905
NO ONE FOLLOWED ME.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.950
(gunshot)
(grunts)

29:43.052 --> 29:45.214
NOT TODAY, MARK.

29:48.257 --> 29:50.019
(coughs)

29:50.019 --> 29:52.191
(groans)
SHH, SHH.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.825
(motor revving)
STAY WITH ME, FROST.
ALL RIGHT? STAY WITH ME.

29:55.825 --> 29:58.127
YOU GOTTA TELL ME
WHERE DEMETRI IS.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.429
WHAT'S GOING ON, FROST?
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

30:00.429 --> 30:02.131
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:02.131 --> 30:06.075
I... I DID WHAT I DID...
FOR A REASON.

30:06.075 --> 30:09.038
HOW DO I STOP THIS?
WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?

30:09.038 --> 30:11.010
MM? WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW?
(moaning)

30:11.010 --> 30:14.013
TELL ME WHERE DEMETRI IS.
STAY WITH ME, FROST, ALL RIGHT?

30:14.013 --> 30:17.116
STAY WITH ME. YOU GOTTA
TELL ME WHERE DEMETRI IS!

30:17.116 --> 30:19.318
WHEN'S THE NEXT BLACKOUT?
WHEN?

31:07.997 --> 31:10.599
I NEED FROST'S CAR. DEMETRI!

31:12.001 --> 31:14.603
DAMN IT!

31:17.306 --> 31:19.308
(car door slams,
beeps)

31:19.308 --> 31:22.151
(whispers) DAMN IT.

31:22.151 --> 31:25.054
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, FROST?
(beeping)

31:25.054 --> 31:28.988
"OEDIPUS AND THE SPHINX" BY
JEAN-AUGUSTE-DOMINIQUE INGRES.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.520
INGRES.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.993
(beeps)

31:33.993 --> 31:36.265
(woman) PROCEED
TO THE HIGHLIGHTED ROUTE.

31:36.265 --> 31:37.266
(beep)

31:37.266 --> 31:40.069
(bell dings, engine starts)

31:47.506 --> 31:52.511
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU GUYS
TO THE NEUROSCIENCE CENTER?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.984
WELL, DR. EBBING,
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER

31:54.984 --> 31:56.986
OF A HOMELESS MAN
IN A SHELTER DOWNTOWN.

31:56.986 --> 31:59.918
WE FOUND SOMETHING OF YOURS
AMONG THE VICTIM'S BELONGINGS

31:59.918 --> 32:04.223
WHEN HE DIED.
MY ADDRESS BOOK--OBVIOUSLY,
STOLEN FROM MY OFFICE.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.925
WELL, WE THINK THE GUY
MAY HAVE BEEN A SAVANT.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.558
PERHAPS HE WAS
ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS.

32:09.558 --> 32:12.031
UH, IT'S POSSIBLE.
HE DOESN'T LOOK FAMILIAR.

32:12.031 --> 32:15.004
SAVANTS ARE REFERRED TO ME
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

32:15.004 --> 32:18.137
AND ANY NUMBER OF THEM
HAVE EIDETIC SKILLS.
THAT'S PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

32:18.137 --> 32:21.340
SOME OF MY PATIENTS ARE
LIKE HUMAN VIDEO CAMERAS.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.612
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE COMPELLED TO RECORD

32:23.612 --> 32:25.614
STAGGERING QUANTITIES
OF INFORMATION--

32:25.614 --> 32:27.616
PHONE BOOKS, ENCYCLOPEDIAS,

32:27.616 --> 32:30.519
THE ENTIRE SUNDAY
"NEW YORK TIMES."

32:30.519 --> 32:32.521
SO ANY ONE OF YOUR PATIENTS

32:32.521 --> 32:35.224
COULD HAVE LIFTED
THIS PHONE BOOK.
EXACTLY.

32:35.224 --> 32:38.057
THERE'S REALLY NO ONE PARTICULAR
PERSON WHO MAYBE STANDS OUT

32:38.057 --> 32:40.729
AS A CANDIDATE?
SORRY.

32:40.729 --> 32:43.562
OH, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE A TRAUMA SURGEON?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.134
YEAH.

32:45.134 --> 32:47.196
SAVANTS--NOT YOUR
USUAL TERRAIN, ARE THEY?

32:47.196 --> 32:50.069
I GUESS I'M BRANCHING OUT.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.441
(tires screeching)

32:55.074 --> 32:57.106
TURN LEFT AHEAD.

32:57.106 --> 32:59.448
(tires screeching)

33:01.580 --> 33:03.682
YOU HAVE ARRIVED
AT YOUR DESTINATION.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.554
(brakes squeal)

33:06.615 --> 33:10.619
(beeping)

33:14.063 --> 33:16.695
DEMETRI!

33:19.768 --> 33:23.172
DEMETRI!

33:23.172 --> 33:25.774
(Wedeck)
ANY LUCK FINDING MARK?

33:25.774 --> 33:28.307
GPS REQUEST JUST CAME IN
FROM ANTELOPE VALLEY.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.640
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD GET
A LEAD ON WHERE HE WAS GOING.
DO THEY HAVE DATA?

33:31.640 --> 33:33.382
WE'RE WAITING ON THAT.

33:33.382 --> 33:36.115
WHY THE HELL NOT--
I'M TRYING!
IT'S NOT OUR SATELLITE!

33:37.786 --> 33:39.588
(speed dials cell phone)
(whispers) COME ON, COME ON!

33:39.588 --> 33:42.791
(beeps)
YES!

33:42.791 --> 33:44.653
(ring)
WEDECK.

33:44.653 --> 33:46.755
Look, I've got no time
for explanations.

33:46.755 --> 33:49.258
I'm at an abandoned army depot
46 miles northeast

33:49.258 --> 33:52.131
OF ANTELOPE VALLEY.
I'M STANDING IN FRONT

33:52.131 --> 33:54.603
OF TWO DOZEN OR SO WAREHOUSES.
DEM'S INSIDE ONE OF THEM.

33:54.603 --> 33:56.805
IF I DON'T FIND HIM
IN THREE MINUTES, HE'S DEAD.
OH, MY GOD.

33:56.805 --> 33:59.308
MARK--
BUILDING SEVEN.

33:59.308 --> 34:01.810
Building seven.
SEVEN? HOW'D YOU KNOW?

34:01.810 --> 34:04.173
ALDA HERTZOG.
SHE--SHE TOLD ME IT WAS

34:04.173 --> 34:07.116
A VERY IMPORTANT
PIECE OF INFORMATION.
NONE OF THESE BUILDINGS
HAVE NUMBERS ON 'EM!

34:07.116 --> 34:10.119
YES, THEY DO.
WHAT?

34:10.119 --> 34:13.082
Rooftops.
Mark, where are you?
I'M THREE BUILDINGS UP FROM
THE SOUTH END OF THE COMPLEX.

34:13.082 --> 34:15.754
OKAY,
THEY NUMBERED THEM EVEN/ODD.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.687
It's the fourth building
on the right.
GET AN AMBULANCE JUST IN CASE.

34:23.392 --> 34:25.394
DEMETRI!

34:34.773 --> 34:36.145
MARK?

34:36.145 --> 34:38.107
DEMETRI! ARE YOU ALONE?
I'M ALONE.

34:38.107 --> 34:40.679
TALK TO ME. TALK TO ME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
OKAY.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.382
WHAT IS THIS?
THERE'S A RIG WITH YOUR GUN,
AND IT'S POINTED AT ME.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.384
I CAN'T MOVE.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.086
YOU GOT ABOUT TWO MINUTES
AND CHANGE TO DO SOMETHING.

34:48.086 --> 34:53.222
EASY.
ALL RIGHT. GARAGE DOOR
AUTO-FIRING PISTOL.

34:53.222 --> 34:55.694
EASY. THERE'S WIRES
AROUND THE BARREL--SENSORS.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.866
YOU MONKEY
WITH ANY OF THAT STUFF

34:57.866 --> 35:01.200
OR TRY TO PUT ANYTHING BETWEEN
ME AND THE GUN AND--
IT FIRES.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.802
RIGHT.
IT FIRES. ALL RIGHT.

35:03.802 --> 35:07.176
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GONNA PUSH BACK
AGAINST THE TRIGGER MECHANISM

35:07.176 --> 35:10.279
TO SEE IF I CAN TRY TO--
TRY TO DO WHAT?

35:10.279 --> 35:13.182
I CAN'T STOP THE TIMER,
BUT MAYBE I CAN MOVE THE GUN.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.647
(panting)

35:18.647 --> 35:22.191
THIS IS IT.

35:22.191 --> 35:25.154
THIS IS IT. MY HAND.
MY GUN.

35:25.154 --> 35:28.427
JUST LIKE NHADRA SAID.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.799
(panting)

35:38.907 --> 35:42.140
85 SECONDS. NO PRESSURE.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.143
ONE, TWO, RED AND BLUE.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.817
TELL ZOEY--
TELL ZOEY I LOVE HER, OKAY?
TELL HER YOURSELF.

35:48.817 --> 35:50.879
FROST SAID CHARLIE
GAVE ME ALL THE ANSWERS.

35:50.879 --> 35:53.282
"ONE FISH TWO FISH
RED FISH BLUE FISH."

35:53.282 --> 35:55.284
"ONE FISH TWO FISH
RED FISH BLUE FISH."

35:55.284 --> 35:57.426
IS THAT DR., UH,
IS THAT DR. SEUSS?

35:57.426 --> 35:59.888
ONE, TWO, RED, BLUE.

35:59.888 --> 36:03.392
IF I PULL THE WIRES
IN THAT ORDER,

36:03.392 --> 36:06.765
MAYBE I COULD TRY
TO DISENGAGE THE GUN.
MARK.

36:06.765 --> 36:10.439
WHICHEVER WAY THIS GOES,
NO REGRETS, OKAY?

36:10.439 --> 36:12.741
NO LOOKING BACK.

36:12.741 --> 36:14.473
NO REGRETS.

36:22.851 --> 36:25.214
(both panting)

36:32.561 --> 36:33.862
(whispers) NO REGRETS.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.964
(electrical buzz)

36:35.964 --> 36:38.527
(exhales deeply)

36:40.899 --> 36:43.432
(electrical buzz)

36:43.432 --> 36:45.203
IT'S GONNA WORK.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.806
IF I CAN JUST MOVE THE GUN.

36:52.881 --> 36:54.713
(whirring)

36:56.845 --> 36:59.848
(whispers)
COME ON. COME ON.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.253
COME ON, COME ON.

37:05.754 --> 37:09.628
(whirs)

37:09.628 --> 37:12.931
(grunts)

37:12.931 --> 37:15.934
(gasping)

37:20.869 --> 37:24.673
(chuckles)

37:24.673 --> 37:27.616
(chuckles)

37:27.616 --> 37:29.578
SLOPPY WORK, BUDDY--

37:29.578 --> 37:31.920
BLEEDING ALL OVER YOURSELF.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.823
(chuckles)
I'M JUST HAVING AN OFF DAY.

37:34.823 --> 37:36.725
YOU OKAY?

37:36.725 --> 37:39.828
I'M FRIGGIN' GREAT.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE.
IT'S MARCH 15th, AND YOU LIVED.

37:39.828 --> 37:42.331
FROST SAID HE SAW
DIFFERENT FUTURES.

37:42.331 --> 37:43.362
WHOA.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.964
HIS MAP OF THE FUTURE.

37:45.964 --> 37:49.938
HE CALLED IT HIS,
UH, GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.471
YOU THINK IT'S SAFE
TO STAND NOW?

37:52.471 --> 37:57.406
WELL, ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT. STAY LOW.

37:57.406 --> 37:59.948
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

37:59.948 --> 38:01.880
ONE, TWO, THREE.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.813
(machinery whirs)

38:07.856 --> 38:11.320
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.021
OH, NO.

38:13.021 --> 38:14.823
GOTTA LOVE THIS GUY.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.825
EVEN IN DEATH,

38:16.825 --> 38:19.968
HE MANAGES TO SCREW US.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.934
(Vreede) GOOD THING
MARK SAVED THE DAY,

38:25.934 --> 38:28.607
SINCE ALL WE FOUND
WAS A PHONE BOOK.
(espresso machine whirring)

38:28.607 --> 38:30.479
HI THERE. CAN I GET A SMALL--

38:30.479 --> 38:32.911
SHE'LL HAVE A SMALL SOY LATTE,
NO FOAM, EXTRA SHOT,

38:32.911 --> 38:35.914
HALF SUGAR, HALF ASPARTAME.
OKAY, NOW YOU SAY YOUR THING.
(laughs)

38:35.914 --> 38:39.748
SAY IT. SAY THE THING YOU
WERE GONNA SAY. YOU SAY...
HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY COFFEE ORDER?

38:39.748 --> 38:41.750
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.623
I SAY I HAVE STOOD BEHIND YOU
IN THIS LINE MANY TIMES.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.995
YOU ALWAYS ORDER
THE SAME WAY.

38:46.995 --> 38:49.858
(chuckles) NO, I'VE NEVER
ORDERED FROM THIS CART BEFORE.

38:49.858 --> 38:52.831
I HAVE STOOD BEHIND YOU
HERE IN THIS LINE,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.964
ON THIS DAY,
MANY, MANY TIMES.

38:55.964 --> 38:58.767
AND YOU ALWAYS ORDER
THE SAME WAY. (chuckles)

38:58.767 --> 39:01.910
MY NAME IS GABRIEL.
YOU DESERVE A BREAK TODAY.

39:01.910 --> 39:03.642
OH, OKAY, HI.
YEAH. MY NAME IS GABRIEL.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.744
COME ON, BUDDY.
DON'T TOUCH THIS.
YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.816
(speaks indistinctly)
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST...
YEAH.

39:07.816 --> 39:09.818
IT'S ABOUT
THE RAVEN RIVER EXPERIMENTS.

39:09.818 --> 39:11.920
THE RAVEN RIVER EXPERIMENTS.
WHAT EXPERIMENTS?

39:11.920 --> 39:14.723
THAT'S WHAT MY FRIEND WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT,

39:14.723 --> 39:17.656
ONLY HE'S DEAD NOW,
AND IT--IT'S UP TO ME.
WHAT FRIEND?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.888
MY FRIEND. HE'S DEAD,
ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY

39:19.888 --> 39:22.561
HE'S STILL MY FRIEND.
HE TEXTED YOU.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE TEXT?

39:22.561 --> 39:26.895
THE FLASH-FORWARDS...
(lowers voice) THE BLACKOUT.
SIR, I THINK, UH, YOU NEED
TO COME AND TALK TO US.

39:26.895 --> 39:30.138
(normal voice) NO, YOU DON'T
SAY THAT. YOU NEVER SAY THAT.

39:30.138 --> 39:33.472
CAN'T TOUCH THIS! CAN'T TOUCH
THIS! CAN'T TOUCH THIS!
LISTEN, JUST A FEW--
JUST A FEW QUESTIONS.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.904
THE DOMINOS ARE FALLING,
OLIVIA.

39:42.851 --> 39:45.854
(sirens wailing in distance)

40:06.475 --> 40:08.477
YOU GOT THROUGH THE DAY.

40:09.778 --> 40:11.440
BOSS.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.442
(Janis) WHAT WAS ALL THIS?

40:13.442 --> 40:15.914
OH, THIS? THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
THE BREAK WE NEEDED,

40:15.914 --> 40:18.987
THE KEY TO
THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION--

40:18.987 --> 40:20.989
FROST'S PERSONAL ROAD MAP
OF THE FUTURE.

40:20.989 --> 40:23.452
ACCORDING TO DEMETRI, THE GUY
HAD HUNDREDS OF FLASH-FORWARDS.

40:23.452 --> 40:26.495
SO THIS CRAZY-ASS MAP CHARTED
ALL THE MOMENTS HE SAW

40:26.495 --> 40:28.997
LEADING UP TO TODAY
AND BEYOND.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:28.997 --> 40:31.159
THERE WERE EVENTS ON HERE
THAT OCCURRED AFTER APRIL 29th.

40:31.159 --> 40:33.862
YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THEM?
MM-HMM. A FEW.

40:33.862 --> 40:36.935
ONE STOOD OUT, THOUGH. IT WAS
ALL THE WAY UP BY THE TOP--

40:36.935 --> 40:39.007
THE FURTHEST ONE FROM TODAY.

40:39.007 --> 40:41.510
ALL THE OTHER VARIOUS BRANCHES
SEEMED TO LEAD TO IT.

40:41.510 --> 40:43.842
DECEMBER 12, 2016.

40:46.044 --> 40:49.447
AND AFTER THE DATE...

40:49.447 --> 40:52.951
IT JUST SAID "THE END."

40:52.951 --> 40:55.053
THE END OF WHAT?
