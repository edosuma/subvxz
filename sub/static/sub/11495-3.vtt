00:20.738 --> 00:23.539
I was before you ate
that last garlic knot.

00:23.541 --> 00:25.675
Oh, I'm serious.
I mean, don't you think

00:25.677 --> 00:27.443
our relationship has become
a little bit predictable?

00:27.445 --> 00:29.745
Predictable? Yes.

00:29.747 --> 00:32.381
Why do you ask?
Well, I was thinking

00:32.383 --> 00:34.617
that maybe we could
spice things up a little.

00:34.619 --> 00:37.053
What'd you have in mind?

00:37.055 --> 00:39.055
Well, um...

00:39.057 --> 00:42.126
I have been reading
Fifty Shades of Grey.

00:42.128 --> 00:43.594
Oh.

00:43.596 --> 00:48.365
And I have some silk scarves
and, uh, some duct tape.

00:48.367 --> 00:50.367
Do you see this
taking place in a bedroom

00:50.369 --> 00:52.803
or the back
of a panel van?

00:52.805 --> 00:54.638

halfway through the book.

pictures of you.

01:12.759 --> 01:14.759

a lot available online.

Oh, well, I-I-I guess

01:23.737 --> 01:27.004
it's a-a cliché
for a guy, but, um...

01:27.006 --> 01:30.275
I've always wanted
to have a-a threesome.

01:30.277 --> 01:31.943
Okay.

- Of course I would.

a threesome also.

01:55.336 --> 01:57.236
See? See?

01:57.238 --> 02:00.339
This is why communication is
so important in a relationship.

02:00.341 --> 02:01.741
I mean, two minutes ago

02:01.743 --> 02:03.609
I didn't care if
you lived or died.

02:03.611 --> 02:08.913
Now I love you more than
any man has ever loved a woman.

02:08.916 --> 02:10.215
You complete me,

02:10.217 --> 02:12.717

11:09.289 --> 11:10.355
Well,
I'm just saying,

11:10.357 --> 11:11.589
we're playing on
a public course here.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.090

of strokes.

11:16.028 --> 11:17.729
You just be the maypole

11:17.731 --> 11:21.031
and let her run around
with the ribbons.

11:21.033 --> 11:24.201
No, no, that is not my style.

11:24.203 --> 11:25.669
I'm very aggressive.

11:26.538 --> 11:27.871
I'm in it to win it.

11:29.408 --> 11:32.709
What do you think, boys?

11:32.711 --> 11:35.713
I am definitely gonna win it.

11:35.715 --> 11:38.782
Oh, yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

11:38.784 --> 11:40.284
Uh, you do look
beautiful, darling.

11:40.286 --> 11:41.586
Yeah, thanks.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.055
Ooh.

11:48.727 --> 11:51.262
This is probably bad to say,

11:51.264 --> 11:53.898
but Zoey had an outfit
like that

11:53.900 --> 11:54.966
she used to wear
all the time.

11:54.968 --> 11:57.068
Well, not all the time.

11:57.070 --> 11:59.537
Just when we
were having sex.

11:59.539 --> 12:01.572
Which was pretty much
all the time.

12:01.574 --> 12:05.042
I'm sorry, sweetie.

12:05.044 --> 12:08.313
Oh, I guess we're starting,
okay, uh, um...

12:16.522 --> 12:21.159
You know, I-I, um,
I not only loved Zoey.

12:21.161 --> 12:22.894
I also loved
her daughter.

12:22.896 --> 12:27.065
That is beautiful.

12:37.010 --> 12:39.011
I kinda thought we
were gonna be family.

12:39.013 --> 12:41.680
We're your family now.

12:41.682 --> 12:44.650
I'm starting to feel a little
like a very distant cousin.

12:49.323 --> 12:52.625
I miss her so much.

12:54.795 --> 12:57.897

that you're a great guy,

15:51.178 --> 15:53.378
that you're still very much
in love with me

15:53.380 --> 15:56.881
and that I'm a complete idiot
for breaking up with you.

15:56.883 --> 16:00.584
I am. I am. You are.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.819
You didn't put her up

16:02.821 --> 16:04.688
No, not at all.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.023

that you'd say that.

16:12.098 --> 16:14.231
So, do you think that...

16:14.233 --> 16:16.567
You, sir, can make out
with my girlfriend

16:16.569 --> 16:18.202
any time you want.

16:20.405 --> 16:23.507
You got her so worked up,
she humped my brains out.

Eh, I guess.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.893
What's wrong with her?

17:13.895 --> 17:16.762

matchy-matchy, isn't it?

17:16.763 --> 17:19.531
The outfit's going to be
on the floor of the bedroom.
