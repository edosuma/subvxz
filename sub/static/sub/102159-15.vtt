Morgan Edge is not
from this planet.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.126
He, in fact, is from Krypton.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.878
- Morgan Edge is Kryptonian?

31:25.342 --> 31:27.761
- Yes.
I only discovered this recently

31:27.761 --> 31:30.347
when he revealed he wanted
to turn humans into our kind.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.557
- You mean Smallvillians
into Kryptonians.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.518
- Yes, using a device
from Krypton

31:34.518 --> 31:37.687
to supplant the human mind
with a Kryptonian one

31:37.687 --> 31:39.022
and a mineral only found here

31:39.022 --> 31:40.690
that would grant
the host powers.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.568
That's why he was here
and why he purchased mines.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.570
- First, take over Smallville
then the world?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.698
- Something like that.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.326
- And is it still possible
for these Kryptonian minds

31:51.326 --> 31:53.203
to be implanted in humans?

31:53.203 --> 31:55.664
- No, not anymore.

31:55.664 --> 31:58.208
- Makes me wonder,
are you at all worried

31:58.208 --> 32:00.961

afraid of Kryptonians?
