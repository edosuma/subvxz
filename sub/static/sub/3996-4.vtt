on TV)

(woman screaming on TV)

00:07.297 --> 00:08.709
Ooh.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.379
Scary movie.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.045
I hate scary movies.

00:12.126 --> 00:13.416
Why are we watching this?

00:13.495 --> 00:15.166
We're not watching this, Jess.

00:15.168 --> 00:17.500
<i>We're watching it.</i>

00:17.543 --> 00:20.295
(scary movie music continues)

00:20.356 --> 00:21.870
(groans)

00:26.819 --> 00:29.469
So fun, hanging
with the dudes,

00:29.471 --> 00:32.451
eating ice cream,
watching scary movies.

00:32.453 --> 00:34.857
(deep voice):
We're not scared; we're dudes.

00:34.943 --> 00:35.862
Shh!

00:37.066 --> 00:39.185
(woman screaming on TV)

00:39.190 --> 00:41.077
(whispering):
You know what we should watch?

00:41.153 --> 00:43.279
<i>Have you guys ever seen Fame?</i>

00:43.509 --> 00:46.535
It's about a group of dreamers
with talent to spare,

00:46.687 --> 00:48.655
taking New York City by storm,

00:48.934 --> 00:50.773
one dance number
at a time... 

00:50.860 --> 00:51.892
the cafeteria,

00:52.018 --> 00:53.396
the street...

00:53.480 --> 00:54.883
Oh! Ooh!

00:54.968 --> 00:56.352
That's so much blood.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.813
It's spurting!

00:57.851 --> 00:59.802
Mmm, that was good.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.922
That guy's gonna blow
himself up.

01:02.924 --> 01:04.399
** Wah, wah.

01:04.544 --> 01:05.951
Why would that guy
blow himself up?

01:06.180 --> 01:08.378
(explosion on TV)

01:08.509 --> 01:10.388
Sorry. I saw it
in the theater.

01:10.606 --> 01:12.790
You know what else
we should watch?

01:12.846 --> 01:13.837
<i>An American Tale.</i>

01:13.924 --> 01:15.377
It's about a little Jewish mouse

01:15.463 --> 01:16.875
with a great big heart and a...

01:16.966 --> 01:17.875
All right.

01:17.957 --> 01:18.873
Wait.

01:18.956 --> 01:20.321
Where are you guys going?

01:20.323 --> 01:23.421
** Hey, girl

01:23.485 --> 01:25.483
** What you doing?

01:25.539 --> 01:28.506
** Hey, girl

01:28.587 --> 01:31.539
** Where you going?

01:31.622 --> 01:33.835
<i>** Who's that girl?
** Who's that girl? **</i>

01:33.919 --> 01:35.714
** Who's that girl?

01:35.716 --> 01:37.984
<i>** Who's that girl? **
** It's Jess.</i>

By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.es
== SPREAD THE WORD ==

01:43.520 --> 01:45.814
Do you know where
you're taking her?
No.

01:45.859 --> 01:47.584
Do you need a list
of my sexiest date spots?

01:47.641 --> 01:48.954
You know, it's been
a while for you.

01:48.990 --> 01:50.149
Want me to stretch you out?

01:50.151 --> 01:51.778
It's not a date, Schmidt.

01:51.841 --> 01:53.545
Actually, I don't know
what it is.

01:53.624 --> 01:55.637
She's, uh... she's
a little hard to read.

01:55.687 --> 01:58.313
Wouldn't it be funny
if we, like, went out? Like...

01:58.521 --> 02:00.183
Do you want to go on a date?
Yeah.

02:00.276 --> 02:01.643
We, like, go for dinner,

02:01.683 --> 02:04.014
and, like, the two of us,
like, do stuff.

02:04.116 --> 02:05.932
Is that a yes?
I know, right?

02:05.993 --> 02:07.465
Seriously, do you want
to get dinner...?
Right. No, I know.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.364
Sometimes she's so ironic

02:09.366 --> 02:11.348
that I think
she's being serious.

02:11.429 --> 02:13.312
I get it. Led
Zeppelin is classic,

02:13.394 --> 02:15.348
but I mean, it's no, like,
Steve Miller Band.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.152
Steve Miller Band?
"The Joker"?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.344
Oh, yeah. No, I love
The Steve Miller Band.

02:25.428 --> 02:27.519
Hey, look. You've been out
of the game for a while.

02:27.602 --> 02:28.762
I have three date packages.

02:28.811 --> 02:30.464
They work every time.

02:30.516 --> 02:33.964
Package A: Close-up
magic, dinner, drinks.

02:34.004 --> 02:37.221
Package B: Close-up
magic, drinks.

02:37.285 --> 02:39.837
Package C:...

02:39.927 --> 02:41.509
Close-up magic.

02:41.581 --> 02:43.113
You have a date? Fun!

02:43.167 --> 02:45.088
I want to talk to you guys
about this stuff.

02:45.141 --> 02:46.125
With Amanda.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.718
Schmidt.
Amanda?

02:47.781 --> 02:48.948
From the bar?

02:48.950 --> 02:49.789
Whoa!

02:49.839 --> 02:50.920
She's a looker.

02:50.969 --> 02:52.460
Hatchie-matchie!

02:52.544 --> 02:54.279
Yeah, I know how hot she is,
Jess.

02:54.334 --> 02:56.312
Have you been out with anyone
since Caroline?

02:56.392 --> 02:57.147
No.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.967
Whoa! Big-deal alert.

02:59.969 --> 03:01.830
Scary stuff, kids.

03:01.911 --> 03:03.239
Yeesh!

03:03.292 --> 03:05.620
Falling rocks. Bridge out.
Duck!

03:05.657 --> 03:06.836
This is why I don't talk to you,
Jess.

03:06.905 --> 03:07.956
Nick, you're gonna be fine.

03:07.997 --> 03:09.120
Don't worry about it.

03:09.159 --> 03:11.501
Just, you know,
suck in the gut.

03:11.579 --> 03:13.328
What gut?

03:13.417 --> 03:15.282
The little pooch where you
keep your extra cookies.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.580
(exhales)

03:27.984 --> 03:29.264
(exhales)

03:35.430 --> 03:37.268
All right.

03:38.613 --> 03:39.729
(stereo clicks on)

03:39.777 --> 03:42.620
(reggae song playing)

03:44.981 --> 03:47.771
** Well, you say with this riddim
you have a patch? **

03:47.870 --> 03:50.467
** Yellowman mend it

03:50.554 --> 03:55.548

03:55.607 --> 03:59.053

04:01.425 --> 04:04.142
** Seh if yuh have a paper,
yuh must have a pen **

04:04.219 --> 04:07.017
** And if yuh have a start,

04:07.086 --> 04:09.676
** Seh five plus five,
it equal to ten **

04:09.754 --> 04:11.295
** And if yuh have goat...

04:11.392 --> 04:13.242
I had a lot of adventures
in this room

04:13.244 --> 04:15.372
while you were gone, Winston.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.130
(sighs) How'd the
job interview go?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.007
You know, terrible.

04:19.076 --> 04:20.378
Did you see the
JWoww retweet

04:20.522 --> 04:21.697
and Gaga Twitpic?

04:23.904 --> 04:26.236
I know Word,
and I can open a document...

04:27.271 --> 04:28.796
...save it, save as,

04:28.798 --> 04:30.453
print,

04:30.686 --> 04:32.165
print preview...

04:32.233 --> 04:33.419
She just wanted
to chitchat about stuff

04:33.500 --> 04:34.903
I've never even heard of.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.455
Well, you gotta get
up to speed, man.

04:36.549 --> 04:38.094
<i>The chitchat is
the interview.</i>

04:38.173 --> 04:40.797
I've spent the last two years
of my life in Latvia.

04:40.799 --> 04:41.851
I was playing ball
year round.

04:42.077 --> 04:43.330
I didn't read the news.

04:43.407 --> 04:45.159
I have no idea
what happened in America.

04:45.234 --> 04:46.239
I've got interviews tomorrow.

04:46.303 --> 04:47.450
Fill me in. What'd I miss?

04:47.526 --> 04:49.410
From... from the past two years?

04:49.510 --> 04:51.047
Give me the highlights.
Highlights. Okay.

04:51.114 --> 04:52.776
Uh, country's broke.

04:52.877 --> 04:55.037
Betty White's back.

04:55.091 --> 04:58.036
Oh, cool, cool. What about
the rest of the Golden Girls?

04:58.094 --> 04:59.415
All dead, man.

05:01.237 --> 05:03.779
Damn. You know what?
Give me your computer.

05:03.877 --> 05:06.657
I gotta get started, man.
I'm going in.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.693
** Lady Ann a yuh

** Zungguzungguguzungguzeng,

05:23.063 --> 05:25.022
It is what it is.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.547
** Zungguzungguguzungguzeng...

05:28.598 --> 05:31.548
Hey, Nick, can you turn down
that music?

05:31.589 --> 05:33.555
** 'Ca Yellowman make yuh

05:33.647 --> 05:36.719
** Me chat all me lyric,

05:36.808 --> 05:40.393
** Me nuh eat lime it

05:40.472 --> 05:41.925
Hey, Nick,

05:42.008 --> 05:43.469
What...? What are you...?!

05:43.547 --> 05:46.218
(giggly scream)

05:46.303 --> 05:48.656
Oh, my God!

05:55.186 --> 05:57.771
Look at you.
You're like an animal.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.490
<i>What are you watching now?
The King's Speech
and Human Centipede.</i>

06:00.730 --> 06:03.262
<i>Next up: Precious
and David After Dentist.</i>

06:03.314 --> 06:05.321
I think you're
doing a good job.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.780
Okay, you know
what, test me.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.574
Pretend this is an interview.
Hit me with the chitchat.

06:08.627 --> 06:09.835
Ask me anything.

06:09.908 --> 06:11.121
Chitchat. Let's go.

06:11.172 --> 06:12.388
Forget it, man.
Let's go!

06:12.449 --> 06:13.474
Come on, what are you
waiting for, man?

06:13.559 --> 06:15.267
You're getting
intense right now.

06:15.302 --> 06:17.031
You're the intense one.
I think you need
to bring it down.

06:17.091 --> 06:18.063
(clears throat)

06:18.125 --> 06:19.514
Can I talk to you for a sec?

06:19.600 --> 06:21.520
Something's happened.

06:21.594 --> 06:24.189
It was totally an accident.

06:24.271 --> 06:26.776
Not a big deal.
I just want to do

06:26.821 --> 06:29.159
the mature thing
and come clean about it.

06:29.243 --> 06:33.365
But, um, I accidentally saw
Nick's pee-pee.

06:33.453 --> 06:34.658
What?
What'd she say?

06:34.707 --> 06:37.629
I accidentally saw
Nick's pee-pee

06:37.679 --> 06:39.041
and his bubbles.

06:39.131 --> 06:41.214
But it's not a big deal.

06:41.295 --> 06:42.839
Ain't no thing.

06:42.882 --> 06:43.884
(door opens)
Ain't no thaaang.

06:43.966 --> 06:46.361
Oh, Nick, hey.

06:46.444 --> 06:47.689
Hey.

06:47.777 --> 06:50.625
So, that was weird, right?

06:50.688 --> 06:51.950
I'm running out
the door, Jess.

06:52.019 --> 06:53.489
I think we should
talk about it.

06:53.535 --> 06:54.524
Talk about what?

06:54.574 --> 06:57.747
About me seeing...

06:57.844 --> 06:59.465
your peen.

07:02.109 --> 07:03.971
(with British accent):
The peen what I saw.

07:05.481 --> 07:06.816
<i>(with French accent):
Bonjour, le peen.</i>

07:06.880 --> 07:07.898
You're blocking the door.

07:07.988 --> 07:09.270
Okay. Cool.

07:09.348 --> 07:11.049
Have fun on your date.

07:11.102 --> 07:13.060
(laughs awkwardly):
Tell that guy to behave.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.331
The adventure begins.

07:15.399 --> 07:17.030
Okay. Excuse me, Jess.

07:19.210 --> 07:25.468
(groaning)

07:25.542 --> 07:28.579
That was so horrible.
What am I gonna do?

07:28.640 --> 07:31.258
He's never gonna speak to me
again. I'm so embarrassed.

07:31.303 --> 07:33.480
It's not a big deal.
I've seen Nick's stuff,
like, a million times.

07:33.566 --> 07:35.156
You have?

07:35.310 --> 07:37.317
I mean... how?

07:37.439 --> 07:38.435
We grew up togethe

07:38.437 --> 07:40.108
Locker rooms,
swimming pools,

07:40.171 --> 07:41.539
penis fights... 
it just happens.

07:41.611 --> 07:42.556
Why haven't I seen it?

07:42.623 --> 07:43.973
Why do you want to see it?

07:44.043 --> 07:45.436
He's my best friend.

07:45.503 --> 07:48.288
Again, why do you
want to see it?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.604
What if Nick gets
into an accident?

07:49.748 --> 07:51.636
What if he's
horribly disfigured,

07:51.731 --> 07:53.215
and I have to identify him,

07:53.360 --> 07:55.691
and all that remains
are his private parts?

07:55.773 --> 07:57.606
And I'm standing there
and I'm saying,

07:57.673 --> 07:59.704
"Sorry, Officer,
I can't help you,

07:59.706 --> 08:02.191
because no, I haven't
seen his penis."

08:02.292 --> 08:04.499
And then boom, he's buried
in an unmarked grave.

08:04.649 --> 08:07.169
Again, why do you
want to see it?

08:07.208 --> 08:09.282
What did it look like?
What do you mean?

08:09.284 --> 08:10.389
Just say when.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.775
Just sa... serious...

08:11.777 --> 08:13.973
Seriously? Are you s..
Are you serious?

08:14.027 --> 08:16.344
Okay, you know what.
This is impossible.

08:16.397 --> 08:17.638
I'm starting over.

08:17.701 --> 08:20.312
Schmidt, I need your help.

08:20.368 --> 08:23.523
Okay... all right, Jess, fine.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.162
What happened
after you walked in?

08:25.207 --> 08:27.408
I don't know.
I kind of laughed.

08:27.489 --> 08:29.917
Jess, you can't laugh
at a naked man,

08:30.003 --> 08:31.414
especially Nick.

08:31.494 --> 08:32.722
Nick is delicate...

08:32.807 --> 08:34.433
like a flower.

08:34.517 --> 08:36.722
Like a chubby, damaged flower
who hates himself.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.316
Now, listen to me.
You're gonna act

08:38.381 --> 08:40.515
like this never happened.

08:40.576 --> 08:41.479
We live together.

08:41.547 --> 08:42.513
We're a family.

08:42.577 --> 08:44.517
Families talk about things.

08:44.573 --> 08:48.223
No. Families ignore things
until they go away.

08:48.281 --> 08:49.897
YOUNG SCHMIDT: Hey, Mom,
hey, Mom, hey, Mom,

08:49.945 --> 08:51.011
I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!

08:51.097 --> 08:52.742
Mom, Mom, Mom,

08:52.753 --> 08:54.502
I'm a bunny, Mom. Mom!

08:54.573 --> 08:56.591
No one wants to talk  abou.

08:56.677 --> 08:58.466
Never talk about this again.

08:58.559 --> 09:00.387
Okay. I'll ignore it.

09:01.763 --> 09:03.100
** Not gonna talk about...

09:03.191 --> 09:04.782
Or sing about it.

09:04.869 --> 09:06.257
The bing-bong. I'm done.

09:07.704 --> 09:09.366
<i>This is my... my chambre.</i>

09:09.442 --> 09:12.037
What does that mean?

09:12.106 --> 09:15.131
You're a good kisser.

09:15.213 --> 09:17.135
Can we, can we be serious?

09:17.221 --> 09:18.509
Do you mind just
being serious?

09:18.598 --> 09:19.845
I'm gonna get serious... 
on your face.

09:19.932 --> 09:21.450
(laughing)

09:21.508 --> 09:24.313
I have no idea
what that means.
(laughing)

09:24.398 --> 09:26.347
Actually, let's not laugh
when you're near my penis.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.306
Take it off.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.573
Here, just take
your shirt off.

09:31.647 --> 09:35.291
**

09:40.263 --> 09:41.710
Can't...

09:41.793 --> 09:43.506
Here. Do...

09:43.597 --> 09:44.970
Do you want me to go first?

09:45.013 --> 09:46.352
You're offering just
to take your...

09:46.447 --> 09:47.942
Oh, my God!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.202
Look at you.

09:50.454 --> 09:52.652
Take off your clothes now.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:05.240 --> 10:07.843
President Obama.

10:07.895 --> 10:08.928
Yeah, I like him
to watch over me.

10:10.387 --> 10:14.063
Do you, like, want to take it
slow... or something?

10:16.459 --> 10:19.870
This is nice.
Yeah.

10:19.872 --> 10:22.236
MAN (on video):
It's starting toven look like
a triple rainbow.

10:22.282 --> 10:23.629
(door opens)

10:23.713 --> 10:26.239
MAN:
Oh, my God, it's full-on!

10:29.377 --> 10:30.261
Hi, Nick.

10:31.888 --> 10:34.390
So I guess your date went well.

10:34.392 --> 10:36.103
Sleepover party.

10:37.723 --> 10:39.440
I have something from school

10:39.625 --> 10:41.366
that, um... made me
think of you.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.809
It's a Feeling Stick.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.836
Whoever's holding
a Feeling Stick

10:52.929 --> 10:54.981
has permission to say
whatever he or she is feeling

10:55.058 --> 10:56.297
without being judged.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.273
I'll go first. Um...

10:58.340 --> 11:03.147
I feel like I want to know
what you're feeling.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.683
Believe it or not,
that's not the first time

11:16.765 --> 11:18.668
someone's broken
my Feeling Stick.

11:21.978 --> 11:23.348
I have a travel size.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.008
Nick, wait!

11:27.315 --> 11:30.787
Nick, we have to talk
about this

11:30.862 --> 11:32.706
What are you doing?

11:32.789 --> 11:35.414
I'm sorry I saw your doojer
and your chickadees.

11:35.496 --> 11:37.090
And I didn't mean
to laugh. I just...

11:37.172 --> 11:39.150
Then why did you laugh?

11:39.217 --> 11:40.643
Is there something
funny about it?

11:40.720 --> 11:41.895
No.

11:41.977 --> 11:43.604
It's beautiful.

11:43.678 --> 11:45.016
Stately.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.603
A real treat.

11:46.684 --> 11:47.842
Oh, my God.

11:51.941 --> 11:53.115
(whispering): I think
it's great you dance naked

11:53.195 --> 11:54.587
to Jamaican music.

11:54.674 --> 11:56.242
That's really cool.

11:56.286 --> 11:57.916
You should explore
your sexuality.

11:58.004 --> 11:59.215
(bell dings)

12:00.632 --> 12:03.543
Nick?
Excuse me.

12:03.595 --> 12:05.675
Come on, Nick.
I dance naked all the time.

12:05.677 --> 12:08.432
We have to talk about this.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.227
Ugh! Nic

12:13.897 --> 12:16.234
(sighs)

12:16.294 --> 12:17.407
(bell dings)

12:20.119 --> 12:22.790
Nick, please talk to me.

12:22.831 --> 12:24.177
Jess, there's nothing
to talk about.

12:24.257 --> 12:25.845
You ruined my date.

12:25.923 --> 12:28.060
Every time I tried
to take my clothes off, Jess,

12:28.129 --> 12:30.236
I heard your little...
(imitates Jess's cackle)

12:30.469 --> 12:32.302
Your little crazy
giggle scream.

12:32.347 --> 12:35.152
And all I want to do
is have meaningless sex

12:35.238 --> 12:38.954
with a beautiful woman who, yes,
talks in mind-bending riddles.

12:39.004 --> 12:40.603
But I can't,

12:40.605 --> 12:42.161
because I can't
get your little...

12:42.200 --> 12:46.267
(screaming cackle)
out of my head.

12:48.885 --> 12:51.175
Well, maybe you don't want
to have meaningless sex.

12:51.217 --> 12:52.437
Maybe that's
not your style.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.778
I have a bing-bong
and chickadees.

12:53.834 --> 12:55.604
It is my style.

12:56.864 --> 12:58.483
Stop following me.

12:58.532 --> 12:59.850
Then stop running
away from me.

12:59.899 --> 13:01.900
I just want to have
a mature conversation.

13:01.902 --> 13:03.317
How can we have a
mature conversation

13:03.371 --> 13:05.208
when you can't even
say the word "penis"?

13:05.210 --> 13:07.548
I can say the word "pen..."

13:07.636 --> 13:09.161
Say it.
I...

13:09.217 --> 13:11.258
"Peernyas."

13:11.333 --> 13:13.095
What?
"Peernis."

13:13.171 --> 13:15.318
You said "peernis."

13:15.376 --> 13:17.523
** Penis.
Not singing.

13:17.571 --> 13:19.534
(deep voice):
Penis.

13:19.536 --> 13:20.860
Not like a ghoul.

13:20.908 --> 13:23.160
(chuckling):
I... I can say it!

13:24.576 --> 13:27.028
Pianist.
No, you said "pianist."

13:27.103 --> 13:29.581
Enispay!
Not pig Latin.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.234
"Peernis."
Okay, not in Swedish.

13:31.295 --> 13:32.749
"Pemo."
Not in fake Italian.

13:32.794 --> 13:33.922
(shrieking):
Penis!

13:34.010 --> 13:35.684
Shut up!

13:37.285 --> 13:39.274
Say it with me...  "pe...
Pe...

13:39.370 --> 13:41.299
...nis."
...neers.

13:41.301 --> 13:43.535
Yeah, I'm the one
that's immature.

13:53.001 --> 13:55.297
Hey, man.
Aah!

13:55.395 --> 13:56.460
I'm the only one
who hasn't seen it.

13:56.686 --> 13:58.318
What?
Just the gun.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.673
No.
Just the roses.

14:00.765 --> 14:03.020
What?
Just the hub,
where it connect

14:03.104 --> 14:05.017
Get out.
Fine!

14:05.111 --> 14:06.311
I thought we were
best friends.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.503
We are.

14:07.582 --> 14:08.826
Apparently not.

14:08.828 --> 14:10.490
Best friends
don't do this, Schmidt.

14:10.539 --> 14:12.180
They do it
all the time.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.573
You laughed?
Yeah, I couldn't help it.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.904
Did you freak out and make
that noise that you always make?

14:18.906 --> 14:20.682
What? I don't always
make a noise.

14:22.179 --> 14:25.292
(giggles, cackles)

14:25.367 --> 14:26.732
Fine.

14:26.813 --> 14:28.156
I guess I missed the moment

14:28.227 --> 14:29.659
when everybody got cool
about sex.

14:32.010 --> 14:34.035
I really messed up.

14:34.091 --> 14:36.123
Ah, guys are simple.

14:36.199 --> 14:38.636
You know what I would do?
I would just make it even.

14:38.729 --> 14:40.849
You've seen his; show him yours.

14:40.936 --> 14:42.538
(sighs) No.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.219
I can't do that.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.648
Hey, Winston.

14:46.650 --> 14:49.139
Oh, no. Oh, man.

14:49.214 --> 14:51.089
The interview?
Did you mess up?

14:51.176 --> 14:53.317
No, I didn't mess up.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.713
Killed it. I was amazing.

14:55.768 --> 14:57.263
At one point, I
was on the outside

14:57.343 --> 14:59.824
of my body
watching myself be amazing.

14:59.902 --> 15:01.787
Well, that's
a good thing, right?
The woman asked me

15:01.881 --> 15:03.839
why I wanted to sell
medical supplies.

15:03.889 --> 15:06.492
I had no answer.

15:06.578 --> 15:10.729
I've done anything but play
basketball my entire life.

15:10.802 --> 15:12.878
"Winston Bishop is an
American basketball player

15:12.958 --> 15:14.834
"who played
professionally in Latvia,

15:15.019 --> 15:18.041
and he loves ducks."

15:18.195 --> 15:20.771
Winston, did you write
the part about the ducks?

15:20.843 --> 15:22.588
I don't even like
ducks that much, man.

15:22.639 --> 15:23.899
Okay, look, man.

15:23.944 --> 15:25.484
You got to get off
Wikipedia, all right?

15:25.583 --> 15:26.920
You're going crazy.

15:27.130 --> 15:28.563
I was the guy who
was good enough

15:28.624 --> 15:30.142
to play in Latvia.

15:30.186 --> 15:32.460
And then one day,
I don't know, man... 

15:32.519 --> 15:33.996
I just lost it.

15:34.051 --> 15:36.306
They found another
black guy.

15:36.364 --> 15:39.299
<i>Labak melno virietis.</i>

15:39.368 --> 15:41.887
<i>Means "the better
black guy."
A better melno?</i>

15:41.927 --> 15:43.570
<i>You're-you're the best melno.
I don't know, man.</i>

15:43.658 --> 15:45.034
I just don't know
what comes next.
You know what

15:45.082 --> 15:46.675
you do next? Come on.
You're gonna get up.

15:46.748 --> 15:47.968
Let's get up.
Come on, buddy.

15:48.053 --> 15:49.615
We're gonna get you
out of the house.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.959
We're gonna get you moving.
It's gonna feel good.

15:51.042 --> 15:52.581
Whoo! This feels good.

15:52.637 --> 15:54.965
(out of breath):
Totally. I love it.

15:55.015 --> 15:58.156
You know, I think I
was just scared, man.

15:58.204 --> 15:59.828
I've been playing basketball
my whole entire life.

15:59.888 --> 16:01.642
What if I was
wasting my time?

16:01.700 --> 16:03.916
Maybe I should have been
figuring out my life like you.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.592
(laughs) I don't have
anything figured out.

16:05.671 --> 16:08.018
I'm a fully-grown man
with roommates.

16:08.071 --> 16:10.042
I have a stupid job.
I'm single.

16:10.090 --> 16:12.213
My best friend won't even
let me see his penis.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.431
I mean, my whole life
is a sham.

16:14.488 --> 16:15.947
Aah!

16:15.994 --> 16:18.169
I actually feel
a lot better.

16:18.259 --> 16:20.186
Thanks, Schmidt.
(gasping)

16:20.280 --> 16:21.835
Winston, my legs!

16:21.913 --> 16:23.504
Schmidt?
My legs are
seizing up.

16:23.596 --> 16:25.721
Schmidt!
I hate my life.
I hate my...

16:25.812 --> 16:27.315
making new discoveries.

16:27.368 --> 16:28.798
I'm a fear-based
person, apparently.

16:28.871 --> 16:30.183
Stop it. Go.
I need a...

16:30.237 --> 16:32.499
Give me a hug, please. 911.

16:32.501 --> 16:33.922
Ow. Ow.

16:37.636 --> 16:39.036
Hey.

16:39.104 --> 16:40.490
Hey.

16:40.585 --> 16:43.000
I'm sorry about
last night, Amanda.

16:43.154 --> 16:45.980
So you're... you're, like,
super into "cuddling."

16:46.029 --> 16:48.473
No, I'm not super
into cuddling.

16:48.514 --> 16:50.288
I'm just getting out
of a relationship,

16:50.338 --> 16:52.026
and I think I got nervous.

16:54.012 --> 16:56.029
I've heard that I'm
not great at talking

16:56.031 --> 16:58.937
about what I'm
feeling all the time,

16:59.004 --> 17:01.320
and so I'm sorry
about last night.

17:01.398 --> 17:04.449
Honesty.

17:04.451 --> 17:06.969
I like that.

17:12.539 --> 17:14.136
(sighs)

17:14.183 --> 17:17.487
(lock clicking)

17:19.766 --> 17:21.102
NICK:
Really nice.

17:21.191 --> 17:22.505
(Amanda chuckling)

17:22.565 --> 17:23.608
AMANDA:
Oh, yeah?

17:28.563 --> 17:30.386
Oh, yeah!

17:30.450 --> 17:31.969
Okay.

17:32.053 --> 17:33.939
(panting):
Yeah. Yeah.

17:36.936 --> 17:39.801
Take off your pants.
Take off your pants!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

17:39.941 --> 17:41.740
Take your pants off.
Yeah? You want me
to take them off?

17:41.824 --> 17:43.412
Yeah. Yeah. Take them off.
Yeah, take this...
Want me to?

17:43.503 --> 17:45.552
Okay. Want me to
take these off?
Yeah.

17:45.595 --> 17:47.022
Okay, lights on, pants
off. Here we go.
Okay.

17:47.077 --> 17:48.585
Okay.
Okay. Yeah.

17:48.673 --> 17:51.181
NICK: Oh, I'm totally
cool with this. (laughs)

17:51.254 --> 17:54.033
Yeah.
(sighs) All right.

17:54.113 --> 17:56.297
(chuckles)
Okay.

17:57.630 --> 17:59.311
What are you doing?!

17:59.364 --> 18:01.538
What is...?! Who is that?!

18:01.623 --> 18:05.528
(screaming)

18:05.613 --> 18:06.908
NICK:
What are you doing?!

18:11.838 --> 18:13.743
Hi. I'm Jess.

18:13.797 --> 18:15.925
Welcome to our home.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.947
We live in a world with rules.
We knock.

18:26.371 --> 18:27.959
We have doors.

18:27.997 --> 18:29.550
And we knock on those doors.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.709
I'm sorry, Nick.

18:31.780 --> 18:33.588
Just knock!

18:37.383 --> 18:40.225
Nick... I...

18:40.288 --> 18:42.182
Put that down.
But we have to talk...

18:42.262 --> 18:43.416
Nothing to talk about.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.958
I feel that Nick is not
honoring the Feeling Stick.

18:53.454 --> 18:55.510
I feel me, too.

18:56.819 --> 18:58.374
WINSTON:
I feel Schmidt's had

18:58.376 --> 19:00.156
a particularly bad day,

19:00.216 --> 19:02.988
and I feel that if Nick is
truly Schmidt's friend,

19:03.080 --> 19:05.484
he would show Schmidt
what's in his pants.

19:06.783 --> 19:08.208
I feel supported.

19:08.282 --> 19:10.494
What is going on with you two?

19:10.496 --> 19:12.496
What are you doing?

19:14.089 --> 19:15.430
I feel Nick is yelling.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.699
Stop it!

19:17.752 --> 19:18.845
(door slams)

19:20.511 --> 19:22.883
Yo. I just wanted
to thank you

19:22.978 --> 19:25.187
for taking me running.

19:25.261 --> 19:27.004
Made me feel
a lot better.

19:27.061 --> 19:28.830
Now, I might not have a job
or anything,

19:28.832 --> 19:30.640
but at least I can run a mile.

19:30.681 --> 19:33.560
I mean, watching you try to run,
yeah, that was just pathetic.

19:33.562 --> 19:35.201
I needed that.

19:35.278 --> 19:37.539
I suffer from
exercise-induced asthma.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.641
Do you suffer
from exercise-induced crying?

19:39.706 --> 19:41.902
It's a real thing,
man, okay? EIA.

19:41.991 --> 19:43.676
You know what I learned
from the Internet?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.818
We got nothing to worry about.

19:45.869 --> 19:48.233
Everybody has
their moment.

19:48.322 --> 19:49.830
We might get a cat one day.

19:49.978 --> 19:51.189
That cat might play
the keyboard.

19:51.249 --> 19:52.828
A bear might fall
on our trampoline.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.558
We don't need to have it
figured out right now.

19:55.707 --> 19:56.856
We just need
to be patient.

19:56.858 --> 19:58.166
Our moments will come.

19:59.505 --> 20:01.596
Hey, man.

20:01.676 --> 20:04.368
Let's keep bro'ing out.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.976
(knock at door)

20:05.978 --> 20:07.401
Come in.

20:09.448 --> 20:10.651
Jess, you don't have to knock

20:10.726 --> 20:12.179
once you're
in the room.

20:14.508 --> 20:16.907
I worked on something for you.

20:16.988 --> 20:18.790
All right.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.716
Penis.

20:24.232 --> 20:25.666
Very good.

20:25.732 --> 20:27.079
Thank you.

20:27.163 --> 20:29.367
Um, so did Amanda
call you back?

20:29.513 --> 20:31.003
No, I don't see Amanda
calling me back.

20:31.076 --> 20:32.911
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

20:32.961 --> 20:34.136
Maybe you were right.

20:34.213 --> 20:35.512
Maybe I'm not ready

20:35.514 --> 20:37.123
for meaningless sex
with beautiful women.

20:38.619 --> 20:40.336
Well, you know,
maybe when you are,

20:40.406 --> 20:43.262
you'll be able to show
her your other penis.

20:43.338 --> 20:45.375
Your heart penis.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.177
Get out of my room.
Okay.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.431
Hey, um... (laughs)
when I was, um,

20:50.502 --> 20:52.106
leaving in a hurry,

20:52.189 --> 20:57.141
um, did you see...

20:57.231 --> 20:58.529
everything?

20:58.808 --> 21:00.000
Yup.

21:00.155 --> 21:03.282
Even my... my gumbo pot?

21:03.366 --> 21:06.530
Ugh. Gumbo pot? Get out.

21:17.668 --> 21:19.465
(shower running)

21:21.012 --> 21:23.335
Get out, Schmidt.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.837
I'm the only one
who hasn't seen it.
