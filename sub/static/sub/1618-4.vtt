Tommy was only there
because I was too stubborn.

You were right. I was blaming the Arrow
because it's all my fault, Dad.

Stolen, most likely.

- Never touch them myself.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.082
The Glades' gun epidemic
is out of control.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.130

committed to ending gun violence.

killed the mayor.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.001
Not the actual mayor.

He thinks he's the man to save our city.

- Heh.

- Do you know who I was before the quake?

03:55.760 --> 03:58.206
I was no one. I had no name.

None that mattered anyway.

with a foster family...

32:34.680 --> 32:36.170
