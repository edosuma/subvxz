03:31.753 --> 03:32.833
hey, for cami?

03:32.921 --> 03:33.921
Yeah.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.343
Hey, uh, I don't have
an address for you yet.

03:49.438 --> 03:52.305
Oh, right.
Yeah, I'll put that in right now.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.694
Okay, there you go.

03:58.155 --> 04:01.113
Wow, looks like we're going far.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.564
Yeah. That's okay, right?

04:04.995 --> 04:06.235
Absolutely.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.992
I'm always up for an adventure.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.552
Hey, mom?

04:24.639 --> 04:27.176
Mom, what are you doing up?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.132
Can you see me?

04:29.227 --> 04:31.218
Yeah, mom. I can count your eyelashes.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.853
How was the flight?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.397
We were stuck in a storm.
How do you think it was?

04:36.485 --> 04:37.565
Why are you awake?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.017
It's 3:00 in the morning there.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.602
It's the witching hour.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.688
I like to feel the energies.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.648
Of course you do.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.233
Did the Xanax help?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.943
I opted for wine instead.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.198
It was fine.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.413
Don't look so grim, sweetheart.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.287
It's supposed to be a vacation.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.742
I'm not grim. I'm just...

04:55.837 --> 04:58.078
I'm exhausted from all the traveling.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.541
One day, maybe you'll be happy
to see your father again.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.595
[ Et me know how he is.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.635
I will.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.842
[ Et me know if he asks about me.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.349
Mom, you should really get to sleep.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.810
I love you, sweetheart.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.016
I love you, too.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.110
Your mom's a night owl, huh?

05:29.371 --> 05:35.116
So, um, you up here for work or vacation,
little bit of both?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.326
I'm... actually I'm visiting my dad.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.958
He usually comes to pick me up,
but I was super delayed getting in.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.007
Yeah. I heard about that big storm
over the midwest, right?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.926
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.053
You're really taking me
out to the boonies.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.222
My dad decided to buy a big ranch
in the middle of nowhere.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.932
He wanted peace and quiet
and all that bullshit.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.393
Mom's not into that bullshit?

06:03.488 --> 06:07.026
Mom lives in a Chicago suburb
like a normal human being.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.904
Mmm. Divorced?

06:11.580 --> 06:13.036
Yep.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.701
Same situation here.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.326
You never quite get over it, do you?

06:19.421 --> 06:20.911
Actually, I did.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.247
They're happier now, and so am I.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.878
Fair enough.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.231
So your dad, is he,
like, a-an outdoorsman?

06:41.318 --> 06:44.526
A kind of burly,
bearded dude, or what the...

06:44.613 --> 06:48.026
Look, I'm... I'm really
not trying to be rude or anything,

06:48.116 --> 06:49.356
but I'm exhausted.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.864
I just had a horrible flight,
and, I, uh...

06:52.954 --> 06:55.286
I kind of just want to close my eyes
and go to sleep.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.575
Yeah.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.163
I get it.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.254
Sorry.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.626
I can be a bit
of a chatty Cathy sometimes.

07:05.717 --> 07:06.832
Yeah.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.841
Sorry.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.585
Oh, shit.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.957
You have a good nap?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.712
Um... no, not really.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.137
How far are we?

07:54.224 --> 07:57.387
Uh, another 20 minutes or so.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.977
This is quite the hike.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.770
Yeah.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.071
You know, I really like that picture.

08:14.035 --> 08:18.529
The picture on your profile,
I-1 really like it.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.372
Are you like a photographer or something?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.250
Uh, yeah.

08:28.341 --> 08:31.083
Not an especially good one, but yes.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.929
Well, maybe you're being
a little too hard on yourself.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.807
Well, maybe you just have low standards.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.602
Maybe.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.944
Everything okay?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.196
Yeah. All good.
I'm just eager to get there.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.794
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:50.882 --> 09:55.251
- That-that wasn't the turn.
- This is where my GPS is taking me.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.178
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
that this isn't the right way.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.882
Okay.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.263
Well, if you want
to take a look at the route...

10:05.355 --> 10:06.470
There you go.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.225
I'll do a u-ie if you want.

10:18.201 --> 10:19.941
What do you think?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.201
Yeah, I guess it's fine.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.244
I'm just used to a different way.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.426
You're a really great passenger.
You know that?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.842
The amount of guys that I swipe no on,

10:41.933 --> 10:46.051
just 'cause I think
they're serial killers, it's nuts.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.515
There's just a lot
of creepy people out there.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.442
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.443
Bet you they got great hunting up here.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.241
Well, I wouldn't know.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.412
I don't like guns.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.786
Yeah. No, I get that.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.709
Me, neither.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.627
You just pull a trigger.

11:13.715 --> 11:18.755
It takes no power. It takes no grit.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.466
So how do you hunt?

11:22.557 --> 11:26.049
The way our ancestors did it,
bow and arrow.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.270
That's cool.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.889
I think so.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.189
You know, I should take you sometime.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.106
I-I mean, if you...

11:42.410 --> 11:43.410
Feel like...

11:44.412 --> 11:46.152
Uh, if your dad wants to come, too,

11:46.247 --> 11:48.488
we could do, like,
a group lesson or something.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.080
I'm just not really into
the whole Legolas thing.

12:01.804 --> 12:06.218
So, um, what kind of stuff
do you hunt?

12:06.309 --> 12:12.100
Uh, small game, deer, people.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.358
It was a joke!

12:21.449 --> 12:23.906
Come on! That was funny!

12:25.703 --> 12:27.489
Whatever. I thought it was funny.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.287
I just gotta stop talking. I'm sorry.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.681
Fucking dark up here, huh?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.190
You sure you're okay?

12:58.278 --> 13:01.065
Yeah, I'm... I'm good. I'm good.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.026
- That's weird.
- What?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.907
I don't know. It was like my phone

13:09.998 --> 13:11.954
just had, like,
an aneurism or something.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.327
Whoa! Watch out!

13:20.591 --> 13:22.456
Oh, my god. What was that?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.088
Did you hit someone?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.169
Oh, shit.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.050
Shit, shit, shit.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.557
I don't see anyone.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.601
There's no one here.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.519
I don't see him!

13:45.158 --> 13:47.365
Okay, let's-let's just go.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.829
Come on, seriously,
let's just get out of here.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.665
Yeah.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.459
Spencer.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.840
Sorry. That just really
scared the shit out of me.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.427
Okay. Let's get you home.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.435
What the hell?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.983
What's going on?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.758
Well, it sounds like a dead battery,
but the battery's obviously not dead.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.194
Okay, fuck. I can't deal
with this shit right now, dude.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.650
Whatever you're doing, just please stop.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.361
You think I'm doing this on purpose?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.142
I don't know. I don't know
what the fuck's going on here,

14:35.166 --> 14:37.227
but I want to get out of this car,
and I want to go home.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.243
I can't just magically break my own car.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.203
Just give me a minute.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.471
Shit.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.022
Fuck.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.958
Um, hey, do you have service?
We should probably call AAA.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.418
No, my phone's dead.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.865
And your charger's broken, by the way.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.550
It wasn't doing anything.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.882
Well, if someone drives by,
we can just ask for a jump.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.638
Well, it's 3:00 in the morning.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.511
I know.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.891
What do you want to do?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.267
Um, why don't you stay here,

15:45.361 --> 15:47.602
and I'll walk and try
and find a house somewhere?

15:47.697 --> 15:51.155
- The closest house could be miles away.
- Yeah, it may take a while,

15:51.242 --> 15:53.233
but I'm not just gonna
stand here and do nothing.

15:53.828 --> 15:57.571
Well, I think that's better than walking
through the woods alone at night.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.241
Well, I would feel safer out there
than I do right here.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.662
Okay, fine.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.042
I can't stop you.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.759
Can you unlock the trunk, please?

16:24.442 --> 16:25.898
Hold on a second.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.027
Do you want this or not?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.280
Yeah. Thanks.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.375
Yeah.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.744
What the fuck is that?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.290
Jesus Christ.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.685
How is that possible?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.818
We were just here.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.408
Yeah.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.959
No fucking way.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.522
Fuck.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.465
Fuck.

19:30.419 --> 19:34.207
If you'd have picked up anyone else,
you'd be in bed by now, Spencer.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.222
What the fuck?

20:40.281 --> 20:42.363
She's trying to fuck with me.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.316
Damn, she's mean.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.828
Fuck you, dad.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.624
Fuck you for living
in the middle of nowhere.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.872
I'm never fucking visiting you again.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.587
Fuck you, animals.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.130
Fuck you, unlit street.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.425
Fuck you, fucking stupid driver, Spencer.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.553
Fucking hate this place.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.264
Fucking...

21:13.022 --> 21:14.137
Cami?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.180
No.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.436
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.143
How'd you come from that direction?

21:21.238 --> 21:24.480
Holy fuck.
I just went in a fucking circle.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.566
Well, maybe you took the wrong turn.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.073
No, I didn't take a turn.
I didn't turn once.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.246
I went down the street that way,

21:32.333 --> 21:34.790
and I walked for at least
a mile and a half,

21:34.877 --> 21:36.993
and then somehow I ended up back here.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.415
Did you decide to take
that turn back there

21:42.510 --> 21:44.375
where I told you
it wasn't the right way?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.051
What, the one, like, four miles ago?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.094
Look, I have never taken this way before.

21:48.182 --> 21:50.468
I've never been down this street.
Maybe you have.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.891
I've never been here before
in my entire life,

21:52.978 --> 21:54.969
and I probably wouldn't have
if it wasn't for you.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.464
Somehow you got us on a street
that goes in a fucking circle,

21:57.525 --> 22:00.016
and there's other people
out there, too,

22:00.778 --> 22:04.191
putting up signs and trying to scare us.
Do you know anything about that?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.987
What do you mean, trying to scare us?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.068
I think someone was by the car.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.162
I'll show you.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.160
I thought it was you, but...

22:22.800 --> 22:25.382
Oh, yeah,
the toll man and I go way back.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.505
Yeah, fuck this place.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.712
I'm gonna wait in the car
until someone gets here.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.599
Yeah, good call.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.304
Actually, um,
do you mind waiting outside?

22:34.395 --> 22:36.932
I'd just feel better
if you were keeping an eye out.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.814
Yeah. Okay.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.609
Way to go, Spencer, getting locked out
of your own fucking car again.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.124
Fuck.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.603
Fuck.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.855
Holy shit.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.065
Fuck.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.420
Hey, I need to warm up,
so I think I'm gonna walk down that way,

24:26.507 --> 24:28.168
try and figure out where we are.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.796
M-maybe we missed, like,
a hidden turn or something.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.967
Okay.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.093
Can I have the flashlight?

24:37.184 --> 24:38.094
Uh, yeah.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.470
Yeah.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.097
Thanks.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.569
Holy shit. I'm fucked.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.815
Fuck that shit.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.824
Hell no.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.527
Detour, my ass.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.862
Stupid.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.553
Do you mind if I wait in the car?

27:41.577 --> 27:43.488
I'm not really feeling that safe outside.

27:45.164 --> 27:49.248
Yeah... of course. It's your car.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.187
I just walked through the woods,
and I went in a complete circle.

27:53.255 --> 27:54.870
I don't know what's going on.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.464
I know I'm really tired,

27:57.551 --> 27:59.837
but I just feel like
I'm not thinking straight.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.581
What the fuck is this?

28:42.679 --> 28:43.714
What?

28:43.805 --> 28:45.841
Why'd you put these here?

28:45.933 --> 28:47.264
I didn't put those there.

28:47.351 --> 28:48.386
They were already there.

28:48.477 --> 28:51.685
Why would they be in my carr,
pictures of you and your dad?

28:51.772 --> 28:53.228
Well, how else did they get there,

28:53.315 --> 28:55.055
- if not for you?
- Please, cami.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.267
I don't know why you did that,
but that's not cool.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.159
You can drop the act, Spencer.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.787
I was looking for another charger,
and I found the pictures.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.313
I don't know what to tell you, cami.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.827
Those weren't in my car before.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.566
Okay, I don't even know
how I would get those.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.797
I don't know.
Maybe you went to my dad's place

29:20.884 --> 29:22.420
or you've been stalking me.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.878
Listen, I know we're both tired,
but that doesn't make any sense.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.429
That's fucking crazy.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.636
You want to know what's fucking crazy,
is having a bow and arrow in your trunk.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.718
I hunt with my bow and arrow.
I told you that.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.269
It's fucking weird.

29:34.356 --> 29:35.792
This whole night, you've been treating me

29:35.816 --> 29:40.025
like I'm some sort of, like, serial killer
or, like, rapist or something.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.006
Yeah, well, you've been
scaring the shit out of me.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.021
I'm bad with people. I'm sorry.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.027
I don't fucking buy it for a second, okay?

29:46.118 --> 29:47.483
I don't... I don't trust you.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.410
Your car magically breaks down
in the middle of nowhere.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.829
This is your
insane destination, remember?

29:52.916 --> 29:56.033
You didn't put the address into the app
until after you got in the car.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.664
You made that turn.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.565
You turned down this road.
I didn't want you to.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.080
And then your phone breaks,
and your charger doesn't work.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.416
Yeah, this is weird. I get this.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.967
It's a fucked-up situation,

30:06.054 --> 30:08.545
but I promise you
I have nothing to do with it.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.722
If you could just trust me for,
like, a second,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.453
that I'm not some kind
of fucking murderer...

30:12.477 --> 30:13.387
- No.
- Then maybe...

30:13.478 --> 30:16.470
Those pictures, those personal pictures
of me inside your car...

30:21.153 --> 30:23.064
Where did the pictures go?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.424
No, that doesn't make any sense.

30:24.448 --> 30:25.984
They were right there. I saw...

30:27.117 --> 30:29.859
What... you saw them, right?
They were...

30:29.953 --> 30:31.864
What the fuck is going on?

30:37.210 --> 30:40.247
Whoever wrote on
the back window is still here.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.047
Get in the car.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.680
Get in the car.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.390
None of this makes any fucking sense.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.068
No, it doesn't.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.235
Look, I guess I owe you an apology.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.733
No, you're right.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.989
Honestly, I'm just
so fucking awkward I can't even

31:14.081 --> 31:16.367
have a normal conversation with anyone.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.289
I don't blame you.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.217
I should have just gotten my dad
to pick me up.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.710
I don't know why, but every time
I get in one of these cars,

31:22.798 --> 31:24.678
I just... I can't help
but think that the driver

31:24.758 --> 31:25.918
might be a rapist. I'm sorry.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.674
It's just... it's second nature.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.295
It's okay.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.466
I always think that my passengers
are gonna fucking kill me.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.222
Okay, look, let's...
Let's talk this out, okay?

31:38.313 --> 31:42.181
The photos, the signs,
look, clearly there's someone out there

31:42.275 --> 31:44.766
who's trying to give us these messages.

31:44.861 --> 31:48.274
Yeah, well, maybe it's just some assholes
trying to play a prank on us.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.902
Or it's some assholes
trying to fucking murder us.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.698
Yeah.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.321
But none of that explains
why we keep walking in circles.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.992
Maybe it's just a weird road
and we're both really exhausted?

32:03.004 --> 32:06.337
Or how the photos got into your car.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.337
I don't know how to explain that.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.794
It's not only how they got
those photos of me,

32:11.888 --> 32:15.255
but why did they
deliberately hide them?

32:17.394 --> 32:20.101
Maybe they want you to think
that I'm a psychopath.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.185
So that I would do something.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.986
That message, it says,
"please pay the toll man."

32:29.573 --> 32:31.529
They want something from us.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.620
So I've heard of
these-these road-trap things, but...

32:38.707 --> 32:40.072
What do you mean?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.687
Okay, so a friend of a friend of mine,

32:41.751 --> 32:43.521
she was on this road trip
through the Bible belt,

32:43.545 --> 32:46.878
and they were driving,
and there was these "road closed" signs,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.192
and as soon as they slowed down,

32:48.216 --> 32:50.278
a dozen people jumped out of the woods
with fucking machetes.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.088
- Jesus Christ.
- They were okay.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.059
They reversed,
and they got out of there, but...

32:55.307 --> 32:59.425
No, if-if someone was trying to Rob us,
they would have done it by now.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.636
Some people are just fucked up,
and they want to scare people.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.750
Yeah, like the strangers.
Fucking torture a bunch of people

33:04.774 --> 33:06.890
for an hour and a half
and then kill them anyway.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.796
Okay, I don't know why
you need to bring that movie up.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.214
No, I'm pretty sure it was a true story.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.320
Let's just stop talking about it, okay?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.273
Can you turn on the defrosters?

33:15.368 --> 33:16.368
Yeah.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.955
- Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What?! What is it?!

33:23.418 --> 33:25.018
There was somebody standing right there.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.120
Oh, Jesus Christ.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.265
Okay, I'm gonna go to the back.
I'm gonna get my bow.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.264
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

33:43.355 --> 33:45.095
No, you can't go out there.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.055
I have... I have one of your arrows.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.232
I got it earlier just to be safe.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.560
Okay. Good.

33:56.159 --> 33:57.524
What did he look like?

33:57.911 --> 34:00.368
I don't even know if it was a he.

34:00.455 --> 34:04.164
It was just a...
It was a fucking smiling face.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.909
Christ.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.789
I don't think he's trying to get in.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.210
I think he's just trying to scare us.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.132
Well, then why don't we just wait, okay?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.176
I mean, maybe he'll leave.

34:17.264 --> 34:19.129
Maybe he'll just get bored, right?

34:19.224 --> 34:22.056
I don't know.
He's been pretty fucking patient so far.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.969
What? What are you doing?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.806
No. No, no, no, no no.
Don't do... what are you doing?

34:29.900 --> 34:33.313
If there's a bunch of people that are
gonna attack the car, I want to see them.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.272
Yeah, what exactly
are we gonna do in that situation?

34:42.121 --> 34:43.737
I don't know.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.368
But I don't want to be surprised.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.466
I eave us the fuck alone!

35:09.482 --> 35:10.562
Fuck.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.741
Spencer. Spencer, be careful.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.034
Oh, god.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.378
Now I'm wishing you weren't
so judgmental about guns.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.804
Arrows kill just fine.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.927
Okay, I'm sure they do.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.804
What did they throw?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.477
What?

35:49.564 --> 35:51.646
Something came through the window.

36:15.715 --> 36:20.835
"This road is closed.
Proceed to detour to pay the toll man."

36:23.723 --> 36:25.839
Who are these assholes?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.551
Hey, cami.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.305
Someone's coming.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.623
I don't think it's them!

37:17.402 --> 37:19.188
Broken down?

37:19.279 --> 37:20.894
Yeah.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.479
We need help.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.906
We think people are trying to Rob us.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.574
Trying to Rob you?

37:26.661 --> 37:28.652
Oh, my goodness.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.954
Can you just tell us
how to get out of here?

37:31.040 --> 37:34.203
We can walk. We just need to know
how to get off this road.

37:34.294 --> 37:39.209
Well, I suppose you got three choices.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.291
You can walk that way,

37:42.385 --> 37:48.176
or you can walk that way,
or you could walk that way.

37:49.851 --> 37:51.182
Yeah, we've tried all of those.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.429
They all lead in a circle.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.840
They all lead us right back here.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.559
This place is like a goddamn black hole.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.890
You must be confused.

37:59.903 --> 38:00.903
Yeah, I am.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.649
I'm very fucking confused,
and I'm scared, and I'm tired,

38:03.740 --> 38:05.196
and-and we just want to go home.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.868
But, ma'am, you must have seen
the road closed signs up there.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.082
There were no signs.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.784
No signs.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.378
What? No.

38:20.465 --> 38:21.671
No, no, no, no. You...

38:21.758 --> 38:23.749
You would have driven right past them.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.629
That doesn't make any sense.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.006
Lord protect me.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.092
What is happening?

38:31.059 --> 38:34.426
It's been a long time. I'd forgot.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.137
Do you have a phone?

38:37.232 --> 38:39.268
I'm real sorry. I can't help you.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.771
Why? Why not?

38:41.861 --> 38:44.477
I'm not where you are.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.531
Spencer, can you translate this for me?

38:48.618 --> 38:50.262
We're looking at each other
like we're close,

38:50.286 --> 38:51.947
but you're someplace else.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.778
You're in his place.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.076
Whose place?

38:57.168 --> 38:59.079
The toll man.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.419
What did you say?

39:01.506 --> 39:04.043
The toll man.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.124
He's not like you and me.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.301
He's not a man at all.
He's something else,

39:08.388 --> 39:11.471
but he has his ways
of getting what he wants,

39:11.558 --> 39:13.219
getting his toll.

39:14.435 --> 39:17.177
And what does he want?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.436
Blood.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.190
He wants...

39:24.988 --> 39:26.398
Death.

39:28.616 --> 39:31.449
If you're passing through his road

39:31.536 --> 39:35.575
and he catches a scent, the air of death,

39:35.665 --> 39:38.998
he'll bring you into his world.

39:39.085 --> 39:42.953
One of you, maybe both of you,
has already been close to death tonight,

39:43.047 --> 39:45.254
perhaps contemplating ending it?

39:45.341 --> 39:46.956
Perhaps bound for a tragic accident.

39:47.051 --> 39:50.589
So what he does is he takes that death,

39:50.680 --> 39:55.094
and he makes it change course
right into his hands.

39:57.562 --> 40:03.228
You're stuck on that road, his road,
until he gets his toll.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.855
Okay, I can't...
I can't listen to this anymore.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.938
Please, ma'am, when you get home,
can you please call the police

40:10.033 --> 40:12.945
and tell them where we are?

40:13.036 --> 40:15.527
You don't believe me now, but you will.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.367
Try and take my hand.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.533
Take my hand.

40:22.629 --> 40:23.994
You won't be able to touch it.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.544
It'll pass right through.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.882
What are you doing?

40:29.969 --> 40:31.447
- Spencer, stop. Stop.
- Come on. Try.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.257
Don't. Don't touch it.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.424
I can call 911,
but it won't do no good.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.383
They'll just show up to an empty road.

40:39.479 --> 40:43.722
I can only see you
because I've been touched by him before.

40:43.816 --> 40:47.809
Jesus Christ, lady. Your superstitions
are going to get us killed.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.654
Please. Please,
just when you go home, call the police.

40:51.741 --> 40:54.323
Tell them to call my dad.
His name is Neil Dylan.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.573
He lives at 235 weather ranch road.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.202
Okay, honey, I'll do it as a favor,
but I'm telling you,

41:01.292 --> 41:04.625
you won't see no cops,
and your daddy is gonna be lucky

41:04.712 --> 41:06.953
if he ever lays eyes on you again.

41:07.048 --> 41:11.712
Neil Dylan, 235 weather ranch road.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.714
Please, ma'am, I'm begging you.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.887
There are people out here
who are trying to kill us.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.761
If he can see you...

41:19.852 --> 41:22.434
He can get into your mind
and make you see things.

41:22.522 --> 41:25.639
Don't let him see you.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.068
God protect you.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.147
The fucking bitch didn't call.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.527
I knew she wouldn't.

41:41.916 --> 41:42.996
Spencer.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.620
You okay?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.166
Yeah. I'm just, um...

41:50.258 --> 41:52.123
I'm thinking about what she said.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.584
No. Come on. She's-she's crazy.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.135
She's probably in on it.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.632
I don't know.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.473
You know what?
They want us to go to the detour trail.

42:04.564 --> 42:05.474
I say we just go.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.351
No. That's crazy.

42:07.442 --> 42:08.978
Fine. I'll go alone.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.588
No. They'll fucking kill you up there.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.395
If they were gonna kill us,
they would have done it by now.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.819
Spencer, this is a game to them.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.110
Our only chance is to play.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.954
Fuck.

42:33.634 --> 42:34.874
Okay.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.090
You go first.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.180
Excuse me?

42:41.267 --> 42:44.179
Yeah. You have the better weapon,
so you should take the lead.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.101
You've got the flashlight.

42:47.356 --> 42:49.142
Why can't we just go in side by side?

42:49.233 --> 42:52.396
'Cause I don't really like
being close to your bow and arrow.

42:52.487 --> 42:54.398
Do you want to switch?

42:55.865 --> 42:57.092
I don't know what else I have to do

42:57.116 --> 42:58.635
to prove to you
that I'm not a crazy person.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.071
Okay, okay. Just shut up.
Let's just go.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.449
One, two, three. Let's go.

43:45.039 --> 43:46.700
What the hell is that?

43:46.791 --> 43:49.282
- J it's time, my friend &
- I don't know.

43:50.086 --> 43:52.327
J goodbye j

43:52.421 --> 43:53.661
j adieu j

43:55.633 --> 43:58.124
j bye-bye j

44:01.722 --> 44:05.340
j this is the end j

44:09.438 --> 44:11.850
j so long, my dear j - fuck!

44:11.941 --> 44:15.149
J so long j

44:15.236 --> 44:17.477
j it's sad our time is up j

44:17.572 --> 44:19.108
j let's raise a final cup &

44:19.198 --> 44:23.362
j so soon you will be gone... j

44:23.452 --> 44:25.443
"you're cordially invited

44:25.538 --> 44:29.952
to the joyous nuptials
of Neil Dylan and Andrea Masterson."

44:31.752 --> 44:33.083
Neil Dylan? Isn't that...

44:33.171 --> 44:35.287
My dad.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.246
And Andrea's my mom.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.549
Okay, that's really weird.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.718
These fucking assholes.

45:23.679 --> 45:24.794
Please.

45:24.889 --> 45:29.007
Please. Any-anybody there?

45:29.101 --> 45:30.181
Help.

45:32.313 --> 45:33.313
Please.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.604
No. No, no, no, no, no. No.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.144
Dad.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.274
Oh, my god.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.071
Oh, my god. Dad.

45:45.660 --> 45:46.900
It's gonna be...

45:46.994 --> 45:49.201
It's-it's gonna be okay, pumpkin.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.653
It's gonna be okay.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.613
- Dad, who's...
- It's gonna be okay.

45:52.708 --> 45:55.199
Dad, who did this to you?

45:56.379 --> 46:00.088
Stay away from-from him.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.124
What?

46:04.887 --> 46:06.969
He's in on this, cami.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.348
It's all for show.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.300
He's gonna kill you, too.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.805
Dad, no.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.180
No, no, no. Dad, no.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.977
No, dad. Please, no.

46:22.071 --> 46:23.902
No, no, no.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.110
Dad.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.994
You killed my dad.

46:41.674 --> 46:43.710
I didn't fucking kill your dad.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.132
Yes, you did.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.671
He's not there, cami.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.475
Cami, turn around. Look.

46:54.562 --> 46:55.802
None of it's fucking there!

46:58.441 --> 47:01.478
No.

47:04.488 --> 47:08.276
No. He wa...
He was there. He was right there.

47:08.868 --> 47:11.075
He was right there.
I felt him. He was real.

47:12.079 --> 47:13.819
He made us see that.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.497
Spencer!

47:20.379 --> 47:23.041
Oh, shit! Run!

47:23.674 --> 47:24.914
Go!

47:48.741 --> 47:49.981
Was that him?

47:50.076 --> 47:52.613
I think so, the toll man.

47:59.794 --> 48:01.955
I think he wanted us to come here.

48:04.215 --> 48:07.048
Which means we're gonna see something
he wants us to see.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.801
Hold on a second.

48:10.888 --> 48:15.177
I think I've been here before.
I think I went camping here with my mom.

48:16.769 --> 48:19.727
He's tried you a few times tonight.
I bet you it's my turn.

48:20.398 --> 48:23.561
So what happened
when you went camping here?

48:23.651 --> 48:25.232
Nothing.

48:25.319 --> 48:26.434
It was a happy weekend.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.732
I don't think it's about that.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.572
I don't think it's about just memories.

48:34.036 --> 48:38.120
Actually, wait. I-I recognize this, too.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.747
When I was in school,
we went on this trip to a lake, and...

48:43.838 --> 48:46.295
I used to come to this boathouse, and I...

48:48.217 --> 48:50.173
I used to come here to feel safe.

48:51.095 --> 48:54.212
I have a feeling
it's not gonna be too safe tonight.

48:56.725 --> 48:58.215
Okay. Well...

48:59.812 --> 49:03.100
We can either go in there,
or we can stay out here.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.394
Let's go in there.

49:11.740 --> 49:13.025
Yeah.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
Careful.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.684
On.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.840
Uh, okay.

51:15.739 --> 51:18.697
Cami, they're fucking with you.

51:19.618 --> 51:20.778
Yeah, I know.

51:40.264 --> 51:42.471
What the fuck is the point of this?

51:46.186 --> 51:47.972
No, no, no, no, no! Cami, don't!

51:56.822 --> 51:59.734
Cami, put the gun down.

52:01.535 --> 52:04.322
Cami, put the gun down.
I didn't do anything.

52:04.830 --> 52:06.866
You just tried to kill me.

52:06.957 --> 52:09.144
No, I fucking didn't.
That was just a trick on the screen.

52:09.168 --> 52:10.168
I didn't do shit.

52:11.086 --> 52:12.872
No, that doesn't make any sense.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.295
Well, has anything made
any level of sense tonight?

52:15.382 --> 52:16.497
Come on, cami.

52:18.052 --> 52:21.761
They've wanted you to kill me
from the beginning of the night.

52:22.848 --> 52:25.590
Do you really want to be out there
all alone with the toll man?

52:25.684 --> 52:27.094
Is that really what you want?

52:28.562 --> 52:31.395
If you want to kill me after this,
we can have that conversation,

52:31.482 --> 52:33.188
but at the end of the night, okay, cami?

52:33.275 --> 52:35.266
Put yours down first.

52:35.361 --> 52:37.852
How do I know you're not gonna shoot me?

52:37.946 --> 52:39.106
I don't know, Spencer.

52:39.198 --> 52:41.439
You're just gonna have to
take my word for it.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.985
They only gave you that gun
'cause they thought you'd kill me,

52:46.080 --> 52:47.445
even if it was by accident.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.495
What, you think I can't handle a gun?

52:49.583 --> 52:52.950
You said you don't like them,
so, yeah, that's exactly what I think.

52:53.045 --> 52:55.286
And guess what.
That ain't gonna do anything.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.837
My arrows didn't do shit.

52:56.924 --> 52:58.585
So then why do you need your bow?

52:58.676 --> 53:00.416
I'm keeping it.

53:01.595 --> 53:03.176
We're stuck in this fucking nightmare,

53:03.263 --> 53:05.379
and you're worried about
your precious little toy?

53:08.852 --> 53:11.093
The toll man gave you that gun.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.179
Do you really want that, cami?

53:13.273 --> 53:14.763
The toll man.

53:24.576 --> 53:26.282
Oh, my god.

53:30.666 --> 53:32.952
Oh, my god.
This is exactly what he wanted.

53:36.463 --> 53:39.045
I played right into his hands.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.383
Fuck it.

53:54.022 --> 53:55.387
It's okay.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.771
So what do we think his plan is

53:59.862 --> 54:02.069
now that we're not gonna
fight each other to the death?

54:02.156 --> 54:04.943
He's probably gonna
bring out the big guns.

54:05.033 --> 54:08.901
Yeah, I don't really want to wait around
to see what that's gonna look like.

54:10.914 --> 54:13.747
She said, "don't let him see you."

54:13.834 --> 54:16.997
Maybe if he can't see us,
he can't do anything to us.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.586
The toll man is everywhere.

54:19.673 --> 54:22.665
What are we supposed to do,
bury ourselves alive?

54:25.429 --> 54:27.169
I think I might have something.

54:27.264 --> 54:29.095
We just need to get back to the car.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.174
Then I think we can wait this thing out.

54:32.019 --> 54:35.136
Until when? When is this...
Fucking nightmare gonna be over?

54:35.230 --> 54:37.061
Sunrise?

54:41.028 --> 54:43.269
Getting back to the car
is easier said than done.

54:49.077 --> 54:50.692
They're not real.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.197
Let's go. Come on.

55:07.346 --> 55:08.836
Hi, sweetheart.

55:14.686 --> 55:16.017
Who is that?

55:17.105 --> 55:20.097
I am sorry I never left a note.

55:21.485 --> 55:22.941
You're not my mother.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.442
I've heard that before.

55:30.953 --> 55:33.615
You've always hated me.

55:33.705 --> 55:35.616
Spencer, we need to get back to the car.

55:35.707 --> 55:37.993
It's like you said.
We need to get the fuck out of here.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.457
Do you remember I was gonna
tell you something that day?

55:42.548 --> 55:44.755
Before I took all the pills.

55:45.384 --> 55:46.999
Fuck you!

55:48.720 --> 55:51.587
I can tell you now if you'd like to know.

55:51.682 --> 55:52.842
Hmm?

55:53.809 --> 55:55.140
He doesn't know.

55:55.227 --> 55:56.592
There's no way.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.895
The last thing
I was ever gonna tell you...

56:01.733 --> 56:04.099
The toll man knows, little boy.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.478
He sent me here just to tell you.

56:08.907 --> 56:11.148
You're not my mom. You're not my mom.

56:11.243 --> 56:13.234
- Don't listen to her.
- You're not my mom.

56:13.328 --> 56:14.989
You're not my mom.

56:15.080 --> 56:19.540
Just have to come with me this way, honey,
and then you'll know for sure.

56:19.626 --> 56:22.288
- You're not my mom.
- Honey, come on!

56:22.379 --> 56:23.915
You're running out of time.

56:24.006 --> 56:25.712
He knows all this shit about me.

56:25.799 --> 56:27.005
He knows what she said.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.591
I have to know.

56:29.678 --> 56:30.963
No. Spencer, don't go.

56:31.054 --> 56:32.365
We can't do this on our own. Don't!

56:32.389 --> 56:33.970
I have to know!

56:34.057 --> 56:35.422
Shit.

56:46.194 --> 56:47.479
You're not real.

56:48.238 --> 56:49.819
You can't hurt me.

56:51.742 --> 56:52.857
No.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.403
Fucking bitch.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.265
Hey.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.355
It's gonna be okay.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.812
He's gone.

58:13.365 --> 58:15.902
How can you say it's okay?

58:16.952 --> 58:18.283
He won't come back.

58:18.370 --> 58:21.077
He can't hurt you anymore.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.036
Come back?

58:25.127 --> 58:28.210
He hasn't even left.
He's still in my head.

58:32.092 --> 58:33.957
Please, tell me it gets better.

58:35.679 --> 58:38.341
Please, tell me that your life
gets better after this.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.914
There. All better now.

59:07.002 --> 59:10.369
Why don't you just
start from the beginning?

59:10.464 --> 59:13.206
I can't do anything
unless you tell me what happened.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.841
We need to know
what happened, cami.

59:16.928 --> 59:19.089
Remember what we
talked about, sweetheart?

59:19.181 --> 59:23.094
- Cami.
- If he touched you, I'll kill him.

59:23.185 --> 59:24.620
Remember what we talked about, sweetheart?

59:24.644 --> 59:25.850
Do you need to cry?

59:25.937 --> 59:27.723
You just need some rest.

59:28.690 --> 59:31.181
He's on the track team, cami.

59:31.276 --> 59:33.141
I'll kill him if he touched you.

59:34.988 --> 59:37.229
How much did you drink, sweetheart?

59:37.324 --> 59:39.315
I need you to tell me
just a little bit more.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.195
He's an upstanding young man.

59:41.286 --> 59:42.947
We've all been there.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.653
Are you sure you didn't want to?

59:46.374 --> 59:48.285
Can't you get your story straight?

59:48.376 --> 59:50.367
Kill him if he touched you.

59:50.462 --> 59:51.747
If he touched you.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.066
You'll be fine tomorrow.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.210
It's all gonna pass.

59:54.257 --> 59:56.248
Kill him if he touched you.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.834
Kill him. Kill you.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.004
Kill yourself if he touched you.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.216
- Kill yourself.
- Kill yourself.

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.725
- Cami...
- Kill you.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.040
- Kill yourself.
- Kill yourself.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.396
Just shut the fuck up!

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.031
Almost over.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.076
Thank god.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.456
Y-you know that feeling...

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:43.512
Like you've been
carrying something heavy...

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.599
Y-your whole life, and you...

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.681
Can't put it down?

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.772
You just have to keep carrying it

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.560
every second of every day.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.110
You felt it since you were little.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:06.819
Since when we-we were little, I mean.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.540
No, you're not... you're not me.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.744
You don't have to keep
carrying it, cami.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:19.127
You can set it down.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.551
You're not me. You're the toll man.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:29.759
You've been in the world
of the toll man your whole life,

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.310
and you'll be in his world
your whole life,

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.389
even if you get off this road.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:44.148
It's waiting out there,
it's no better, is it?

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:58.669
Oh, well, we'll go together.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:04.592
Then we can... we can rest.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.920
I'll see you in a few decades.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.586
Come on. Let's get back to the car.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.646
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:30.443
Oh, shit.

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.994
What the fuck is this?

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:18.913
Fuck!

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.389
Go! Go!

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.643
Come on! Let's go! Faster!

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.271
Let's go.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.244
Take the bags. Take the bags.

01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.199
Spencer! Spencer, watch out!

01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh, fuck!

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:02.167
Fuck off!

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.995
Shit, shit, shit.

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:06.585
Hurry! Come on!

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.292
Cami, block out the windows!

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.048
Cami, take the tape!

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.549
Tape the bags to the windows!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.426
Come on! Come on! Tape now!

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.632
Now!

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.726
I hated you, too, Spencer.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:30.405
I fantasized about killing you
in your crib.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.492
Cami, will you marry me?

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:41.665
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.118
I got your dad's blessing

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.933
since you're already pregnant
with our baby.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.920
- No!
- We need to relive our special night.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.800
I always knew

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.299
you were lying about that night, pumpkin.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.846
He's part of the family now.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.828
- We're so happy for you.
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:59.683
Shut up. You're not real. You're not real.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.307
You're not real. Shut up.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.938
I fixed you, Spencer.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.524
You're a much better son
this way, sweetheart.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:18.779
No.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.595
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:48.190
Jesus.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:57.988
So what?

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.616
What, we just wait here
until the sun rises?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.204
It's gotta be soon, maybe another hour.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.516
Maybe my car is working again.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.196
What time was it when we broke down?

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:39.442
A little before 3:00.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.501
There's no waiting till sunrise, cami.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:50.920
We're trapped in here.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.724
They're lying to us, cami.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.558
That's just another trick to get us to...

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:13.689
No.

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:19.570
No, she-she said, "death." Not deaths.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:24.238
What, and he's just gonna
let one of us walk away?

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.243
Yeah, probably.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.542
I'll take care of it, cami.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:41.221
No, Spencer, you are not falling
on your fucking sword for me, okay?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.079
If somebody else
has to die in order for me to live,

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.513
then I'm not interested.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.604
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.607
What?

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:00.406
I think this is all my fault.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:03.489
It's not.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.990
Spencer, it's not.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.157
No, I-I think
that this is all because of me.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.165
What do you mean?

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:18.883
She said, "he looks for the air of death."

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.179
And I know that surrounds me.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.727
Tonight, before I picked you up...

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.227
I was thinking...

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.944
What were you thinking?

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.993
I was thinking...

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:53.785
About what you were gonna look like
after I fucked and killed you.

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:00.254
If he only needs one...

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.462
There's no use pretending any more, cami.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.631
There you go.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.925
You got your fucking toll.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:46.381
Now let me go.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:13.873
Motherfucker.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.166
On.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:30.765
Ahh...

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:40.483
You know, he didn't even really
try to get in my head.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:45.777
Ah, I guess he knew
I didn't need much convincing.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.942
But I thought I needed you.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:51.197
I did.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.904
To get out of here.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:56.207
Safety in numbers, you know.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:02.004
It's too bad, cami.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:05.216
Tonight could have been fun.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:09.133
We had to miss the fun part.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:17.429
At first, I thought
he was trying to punish me.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.057
But, uh...

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:22.938
Then I realized...

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.728
There is no god...

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:29.065
Just the toll man.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.952
And he doesn't care
how many girls I've fucking killed...

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.205
As long as I give him you.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.569
Fucking whore.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.205
No. No.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.118
Oh, I fucking knew it.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:16.173
It's okay. He's gone now.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.553
He's gone. He can't hurt you anymore.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.058
He's gone now.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.607
He can't hurt you anymore.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:30.436
He can't hurt you anymore.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.463
Hey, here!

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.760
Here! I found her! She's here!

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.596
Oh, baby.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.219
Baby, baby, baby.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.766
Baby, oh, my god.

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.889
What the fuck did they do to you?

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.811
- Come on. Come on.
- Dad.

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:06.126
Come on. Going to the hospital.
Going to the hospital.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.391
It's okay, baby.

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:10.101
You're gonna be okay.

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.857
Gonna get to the hospital.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:13.654
You hang in there, kid.

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:14.981
Hang in there.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.692
I got you. I got you.
