00:08.033 --> 00:10.867
(car alarm beeps)

00:11.733 --> 00:12.900
* Come on home

00:12.900 --> 00:14.367
* Coming home baby now

00:14.367 --> 00:15.700

waiting here for you *

00:15.700 --> 00:18.467
* I'm coming home

00:18.467 --> 00:19.733
* You've been gone

00:19.733 --> 00:21.100
* Coming home baby now

00:21.100 --> 00:22.600
* You don't know
what I'm gonna do *

00:22.600 --> 00:24.800
* I'm coming home I
know I'm over you *

00:24.800 --> 00:26.267
* Since you went away

00:26.267 --> 00:29.533
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.533 --> 00:31.567
* I'm coming home and
never more to roam *

00:31.567 --> 00:33.200
* Baby tell me you're

00:33.200 --> 00:37.900
* I'm for sure coming home

00:37.900 --> 00:38.967
* I'm coming home

00:38.967 --> 00:41.633
* Come on home

00:41.633 --> 00:44.133
- Oi, come with me and pick
up Shawn from the station.

00:44.133 --> 00:45.667
- No.

00:45.667 --> 00:47.000
- I thought he was staying
up there till tomorrow.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.933
- He's already missed
one day of school.

00:48.933 --> 00:50.033
- So?

00:50.033 --> 00:51.467
- Come on.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.033
I need you to run in
while I'm double parked,

00:53.033 --> 00:54.467
I'm not paying for parking!

00:54.467 --> 00:56.467
- Amber, Eunice
and I are working.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.767
- And 100 go, go, go, go.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.633
- Perfect babe.

01:01.633 --> 01:03.167
- Working.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.567
- Amber they are working on
getting some new PT clients

01:05.567 --> 01:07.967
with their-
- Summer crunch campaign.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.733
It's a great way to
get people signed up.

01:09.733 --> 01:10.967
- What is?

01:10.967 --> 01:12.467
- Insta.

01:12.467 --> 01:14.100
We're posting of photos of
Eunice torso for four weeks.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.100
Every time we do a post
we get like six sign ups.

01:18.500 --> 01:23.067
- #be yourself, #train hard,
#six pack, #eight pack,

01:23.900 --> 01:25.200
#gym life, #gym, #life, #photo,

01:28.400 --> 01:29.333
hashtag, do you think

01:29.333 --> 01:30.500
you have enough hashtags?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.067
- I haven't finished yet.

01:32.067 --> 01:34.067
- Don't forget #shredded,
that went off yesterday.

01:34.067 --> 01:37.133
She knows all the
social marketing tools.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.667
(laughs)

01:38.667 --> 01:41.333
- Yeah, she'll attract a
lot of tools with that list.

01:41.333 --> 01:42.400
Mom, do you fancy a ride?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.133
(explodes)

01:44.133 --> 01:47.067
- Got the sound working babe!
(hollers)

01:48.067 --> 01:48.800
- Dad, Dad.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.600
Jax still has a fat head,
it's either the keystone

01:54.600 --> 01:56.367
or the aspect ratio.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.767
- What the fuck is this?

01:58.767 --> 02:01.333
- It's your mom's and my
little present to each other.

02:01.333 --> 02:04.567
A home theater package that
threw in two massage chairs.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.067
- Such a good bundle.

02:06.067 --> 02:08.467
- We were already loving binge
watching "Sons of Anarchy"

02:08.467 --> 02:11.067
but this has taken it
to a whole new level.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.667
- Of debt.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.433
It's a no payment for 85
months deal isn't Dad?

02:15.433 --> 02:18.600
I knew it, I just seen that
bloody jingle the other day.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.733
- Relax, it's like five
years before we get slugged.

02:21.733 --> 02:25.267
Try it, Shiatsu or
traditional Tai?

02:25.267 --> 02:26.467
- I thought you were
picking Shawn up?

02:26.467 --> 02:28.067
- Yeah, I'm going.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.133
- I can't wait to hear how it
went, such a wicked festival.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.300
- Is it, something else
for the bucket list, Jules.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.500
- Oh it must be nice to have
so much free time, see ya.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.767
- No, no, no, Amber,
what I meant was,

02:36.767 --> 02:38.767
I don't think you're
picking him up.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.533
(dramatic music)

02:43.367 --> 02:44.933
- What's wrong, what's happened?

02:44.933 --> 02:46.900
- Nothing, I nabbed
a lift from Ashley.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.267
- Hey.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.267
- We met on the first
night of the festival.

02:51.267 --> 02:54.133
- What happened to Mom, can you
pick me up from the station?

02:54.133 --> 02:56.333
- Sorry, I forgot to text.

02:56.333 --> 02:57.433
Ashley do you wanna come in?

02:57.433 --> 02:58.267
- Sure.

02:58.267 --> 03:00.833
(upbeat music)

03:08.733 --> 03:10.533
- Don't touch my lettuce cups.

03:10.533 --> 03:12.467
- I miss this manliness
when I'm at work.

03:12.467 --> 03:15.233
Oh it's mom calling
from the winery tour.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.433
I wonder how she's
traveling with Pat.

03:17.433 --> 03:18.967
Hi Mom, Mom

03:18.967 --> 03:21.067
- Stop guzzling the sangiovese,

03:21.067 --> 03:22.400
you're not supposed
to swallow it

03:22.400 --> 03:23.467
it's a tasting!

03:23.467 --> 03:24.567
- Sounds like it's going well.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.300
- I think she pocket dialed me.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.267
- It's the Barossa Valley

03:27.267 --> 03:28.533
not a Bavarian beer hall.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.833
(call ends)

03:30.833 --> 03:31.967
- I would like to
see Margaret in

03:31.967 --> 03:32.900
a Bavarian beer hall

03:32.900 --> 03:34.900
mainly because it's in Bavaria.

03:34.900 --> 03:37.267
(thuds)

03:37.267 --> 03:39.500
- You did not, you did not!

03:39.500 --> 03:40.833
No, Do not send me pictures,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.133
I do not want to see.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.967
Georgia got a double bed.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.300
All of my friends have one now,

03:47.300 --> 03:48.400
why do I not have one?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.367
- How was the alumni afternoon?

03:52.367 --> 03:53.600
- Life changing.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.667
There was this amazing woman,

03:54.667 --> 03:55.633
Josephine Cantenouche.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.167
- Oh, I remember her,

03:57.167 --> 03:58.767
she was a couple
of years below me.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.533
- She's younger than you?

04:00.533 --> 04:02.533
God, she's achieved so much.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.400
Not only was she
studying for eight years,

04:04.400 --> 04:06.200
she pioneered
performing neurosurgery

04:06.200 --> 04:07.767
through the nose
in this country,

04:07.767 --> 04:09.233
rather than cutting
through the skull.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.467
Which is so brilliant
for so many people,

04:11.467 --> 04:13.500
the UN have funded
five training clinics

04:13.500 --> 04:14.800
across south east asia,

04:14.800 --> 04:16.533
but, get this,

04:16.533 --> 04:18.767
she's done a TED talk.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.600
- But, did she help
with fruity Friday

04:20.600 --> 04:22.667
during her daughter's
primary school years?

04:22.667 --> 04:24.400
- I've never been interested
in medicine before,

04:24.400 --> 04:26.600
but I think she really
changed my mind.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.500
I wonder if I could do my
work experience with her.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.400
- You've never thought
about doing medicine?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.433
- No.

04:32.433 --> 04:33.700
- Really?

04:33.700 --> 04:34.633
- Yep.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.500
- Even though I'm in medicine?

04:36.500 --> 04:38.100
- Well, I think
I mean, you know,

04:38.100 --> 04:39.333
actual medicine, you know,

04:39.333 --> 04:40.600
the doctors doing
the actual surgery,

04:40.600 --> 04:43.467
not just the anesthetist stuff.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.233
Georgia didn't get a double bed,

04:45.233 --> 04:47.133
she got a queen!

04:47.133 --> 04:48.067
That is so unfair,

04:48.067 --> 04:50.700
this house is so last century.

04:54.967 --> 04:57.067
- Personally, I
think fruity Friday

04:57.067 --> 04:58.267
really had an impact.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.133
- Uh, so, I'm kinda heading back

05:03.133 --> 05:04.833
via the coast to the
western districts.

05:04.833 --> 05:07.467
Oh, could I grab one of those?

05:07.467 --> 05:08.800
- Nan, she's 21.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.700
- So yeah, this is
kind of on my way

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
through to the farm.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.367
- Ashley lives on a farm pop.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.133
- Chicken or the beef?

05:16.133 --> 05:17.767
- Bio-dynamic vegetables.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.067
It's a holistic
approach to agriculture.

05:22.733 --> 05:24.067
It's a Steiner thing.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.633
Rudolf Steiner?

05:27.633 --> 05:28.500
- Is he on Insta?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.267
- I'm vegan.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.500
- Right.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.600
- She doesn't eat
animal products.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.667
- Yeah, no, sorry.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.267
- Cheese comes from
the moo moo cow.

05:43.267 --> 05:44.600
- You fucking fucking idiot.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.867
- Amber! That's a double.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.900
- Ashley, you should
check that beer's organic.

05:51.900 --> 05:52.967
- What's your star sign?

05:52.967 --> 05:54.800
- Oh, mum, Ashley's amazing

05:54.800 --> 05:56.233
with star signs, and tarot-

05:56.233 --> 05:57.300
- I'm a little bit psychic.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.867
- Really? I think I'm a bit

05:58.867 --> 06:00.167
like that too.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.500
I always know when
it's gonna rain.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.733
Ow!

06:03.733 --> 06:04.933
- Did you know I
was gonna hit you?

06:04.933 --> 06:06.133
- I need to pee.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.700
- Oh, yeah, just down
a bit, then left.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.433
(upbeat music)

06:19.967 --> 06:21.467
- You're going out with her?

06:21.467 --> 06:22.467
- No.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.300
- Then what was that when you

06:23.300 --> 06:24.467
showed her the toilet?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.633
Is that just how
vegans say thank you?

06:25.633 --> 06:27.500
- Ashley's not into labels mum.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.167
- Except for holistic,
bio-dynamics,

06:30.167 --> 06:31.433
psychic, Steiner.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.733
- She's not into
relationship labels.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.800
Ashley says we're all
just floating particles.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.967
- Fuck me. Well your
floating particles

06:37.967 --> 06:39.733
need to get it together
and do their homework.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.667
- Mum!

06:40.667 --> 06:41.867
- A, she is too old for you,

06:41.867 --> 06:44.433
B, she has a puppy paw neck tat,

06:44.433 --> 06:48.067
C, that is a KIA... Rio.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.333
Fucking hatchback.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.133
- D, she lives 300 Ks away.

06:55.967 --> 06:57.067
- Hey guys, I was thinking-

06:57.067 --> 06:58.567
- Basins just back a bit

06:58.567 --> 07:00.967
if you're wanting
to wash your hands.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.267
- [Ashley] Hey Shawny,
there's this ashram

07:03.267 --> 07:05.600
I really want to check
out in Melbourne.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.533
Is it okay if I crash
here for a few days?

07:07.533 --> 07:08.700
- Absolutely not.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.267
- Course she can stay love,

07:11.267 --> 07:13.333
we've got a spare room upstairs.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.567
- HMDI!

07:17.567 --> 07:19.233
- Excuse me.

07:19.233 --> 07:20.633
- Was it 4K?

07:20.633 --> 07:22.733
- Why did you say
she could stay?

07:22.733 --> 07:23.967
- [Kayne] For what?

07:23.967 --> 07:25.900
- Sons of Anarchy off the USB.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.833
- [Kayne] HDMI 2. 4
is The Walking Dead

07:28.833 --> 07:30.867
via the kitchen laptop.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.700
- Because Shawn
wants her to stay,

07:32.700 --> 07:33.867
it'll be nice for him.

07:33.867 --> 07:35.333
- You don't get to decide

07:35.333 --> 07:37.300
whether a woman who
just climbed down

07:37.300 --> 07:39.933
from a tree gets to
stay with my son.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.433
- Course I do, it's my house.

07:41.433 --> 07:42.600
- It's our house.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.433
- No, it's my
house, your house is

07:44.433 --> 07:46.467
out the back, and actually,

07:46.467 --> 07:47.800
that's my house too.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.433
- Well good luck
cooking for a vegan.

07:51.433 --> 07:52.333
(motorcycles rev)

07:52.333 --> 07:53.400
- Got it!

07:53.400 --> 07:54.733
(cheers)

07:54.733 --> 07:56.100
- Go, let's go, c'mon
c'mon c'mon c'mon!

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
- Hey.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.933
I googled Jos, and guess what.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.167
We were at the Alfred
at the same time.

08:05.167 --> 08:06.400
- But in different departments.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.100
- Oscar, where are
all my lettuce cups?

08:08.100 --> 08:10.600
- You said I should graze on
healthy foods before dinner.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.600
- That was dinner!
This is san choy bau!

08:13.600 --> 08:16.667
Great. Now we'll just
have choy or bau.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.967
Okay fine, we're all
gonna share this one cup.

08:20.533 --> 08:23.067
- Did I tell you that I
bumped into Roger today?

08:23.067 --> 08:24.233
- Who's Roger?

08:24.233 --> 08:26.167
- Professor Roger
Chung, he's a surgeon.

08:26.167 --> 08:27.333
- Yeah?

08:27.333 --> 08:28.600
Any relation to
professor Wang Chung?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.400
Cause we'd all have
fun in his surgery.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.167
All right, you get
the small torn bit

08:33.167 --> 08:34.600
because you ruined dinner.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.667
- No, Roger and I
did that eleven hour

08:36.667 --> 08:37.867
operation last year.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.300
- Oh my god.
Josephine told us she

08:39.300 --> 08:41.367
once did a twenty
two hour operation

08:41.367 --> 08:43.333
separating conjoined twins.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.067
- Is Josephine
still a bit chubby?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.800
- I don't know I didn't notice.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.067
Anyway, who cares?

08:49.067 --> 08:51.233
- No, No one, not me, no, no,

08:51.233 --> 08:52.900
I thought that she
had that illness

08:52.900 --> 08:56.500
that made her a little...
no, that was someone else.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.733
No, she was really nice.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.567
- She still is, she's
also more than that,

08:59.567 --> 09:01.600
she's like, cool,
she's just got this

09:01.600 --> 09:03.167
really chill outlook,
which is what I think

09:03.167 --> 09:04.600
makes her such and
amazing doctor.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.333
- Oh Oscar! What did you
put in the hoisin sauce?

09:10.533 --> 09:12.300
- I prefer Chow
Down Hog barbecue.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.233
- You can't just change
continents like that

09:14.233 --> 09:15.667
it throws out the whole meal!

09:17.067 --> 09:19.733
(Edwina groans)

09:19.733 --> 09:20.733
- Sister problems?

09:20.733 --> 09:22.367
- Sister? You're her sister now?

09:22.367 --> 09:24.567
- With an A, sista with an A.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.100
- Georgia thinks
it's hilarious that

09:26.100 --> 09:27.367
I'm not allowed a double bed,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.300
so she just keeps
sending me photos.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.667
- Well, we never said
that you couldn't

09:30.667 --> 09:31.567
have a double bed.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.533
- Yes you did.

09:33.533 --> 09:34.333
- No, we said that it was

09:34.333 --> 09:35.600
up for discussion.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.900
- You said you can
have a double bed

09:36.900 --> 09:38.700
when you move out of home.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.967
- Dad said that.

09:39.967 --> 09:41.700
- I'm pretty sure
we both said that.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.533
- I'm fine with you
having a double bed.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.400
- Oh my god. I'm
so telling Georgia.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.367
- Yep, I know. Fixing it.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.933
(upbeat music)

10:08.500 --> 10:11.233
- So, just to clarify,

10:11.233 --> 10:13.533
you can have a double bed, but,

10:13.533 --> 10:16.267
you will need to
buy it yourself.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.267
So that you have the whole

10:17.267 --> 10:19.100
rites of passage experience.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.500
And, because I've
seen what happens

10:21.500 --> 10:23.067
to young people with bad backs,

10:23.067 --> 10:25.067
you'll need to have a
very good quality one,

10:25.067 --> 10:27.300
so you'll need to
buy that yourself.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.633
- But that'll take forever
with my pocket money.

10:30.567 --> 10:31.700
- This'll cheer you up.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.633
Nanny Margaret keeps
pocket dialing me.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.633
Hi mum.

10:35.633 --> 10:38.200
* Hey there, Georgy girl,

10:38.200 --> 10:41.500
* Swinging down the
street so fancy-free, *

10:41.500 --> 10:44.333
* Nobody you meet
could ever see *

10:44.333 --> 10:45.733
* The loneliness
there inside you *

10:45.733 --> 10:47.267
- Pat you're dreadfully off

10:47.267 --> 10:48.233
with that harmony.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.167
- Why do you always get to

10:49.167 --> 10:50.400
be Judith Durham?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.100
- Cause you sound deep,

10:52.100 --> 10:53.433
like Athol Guy.

10:53.433 --> 10:56.467
(continue singing on phone)

10:56.467 --> 10:57.433
- Don't be mad with me.

10:57.433 --> 10:59.367
- You know I can't afford a bed.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.133
Well, you might just
need to get a job.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.067
- [Josephine On
Laptop] Thank you.

11:03.067 --> 11:04.300
In today's TED talk I'm going to

11:04.300 --> 11:06.700
share a story about
how I got up the noses

11:06.700 --> 11:08.500
of a pair of conjoined twins.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.800
- Speaking of jobs.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.467
We need someone in my rooms when

11:12.467 --> 11:13.967
you have work experience.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.467
Tracey's going on
holiday so we need

11:15.467 --> 11:17.267
someone to answer the phones.

11:17.267 --> 11:18.567
How would you like to come to

11:18.567 --> 11:19.633
work with me?

11:19.633 --> 11:21.600
See a doctor in action.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.833
- Will I get paid?

11:22.833 --> 11:24.700
- Well it's more
a work experience

11:24.700 --> 11:27.267
rather than- Yes, you
will, you'll get paid.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.867
(upbeat music)

11:41.933 --> 11:43.933
- Did you get almond milk?

11:43.933 --> 11:44.867
- It's in that bag.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.933
Under the big
packet of bullshit.

11:48.933 --> 11:50.867
- Ashley doesn't
drink normal milk.

11:50.867 --> 11:51.833
- Well whose fault is that?

11:51.833 --> 11:53.433
I don't drink wine, but I don't

11:53.433 --> 11:54.933
make you go to Kentucky
to get me bourbon.

11:54.933 --> 11:56.267
- I didn't ask you
to go to Kentucky,

11:56.267 --> 11:57.333
I asked you to go to Cole's.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.200
- Just chill babe.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.333
Hey Amber, you never told me

12:00.333 --> 12:02.300
what star sign you were.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.867
- Virgo.

12:03.867 --> 12:05.667
- Thought so, makes sense.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.867
- Really? Because
I'm a Capricorn.

12:09.800 --> 12:10.867
You want almond milk?

12:14.633 --> 12:15.567
Knock yourself out.

12:16.733 --> 12:18.500
- I've never made
it from scratch.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.700
Thanks Amber, awesome idea.

12:28.967 --> 12:32.100
- Now, there is also
some risk and danger

12:32.100 --> 12:34.067
associated with a
general anesthetic

12:34.067 --> 12:37.567
which is why it is
such an important job.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.067
- [Man] What danger?

12:39.067 --> 12:41.900
- Oh. Not much.
Very little in fact.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.900
My point is, my role in surgery-

12:45.900 --> 12:47.133
- Is to put me to sleep.

12:47.133 --> 12:50.067
(laughs)

12:50.067 --> 12:51.267
- If only it were that simple.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.233
- It's not simple? Why?
What's wrong with me?

12:53.233 --> 12:54.200
(phone rings)

12:54.200 --> 12:55.167
- No no, sit down Eddy,

12:55.167 --> 12:56.933
we need to reassure Mr...

12:56.933 --> 12:57.733
Mr... Uh.

12:58.633 --> 12:59.467
- Villovic.

12:59.467 --> 13:00.800
- Villovic! Exactly.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.067
That everything is
going to be fine.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.833
Of course, and he is in the most

13:03.833 --> 13:04.767
expert of hands.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.800
- I know, my surgeon's the best.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.200
- Yes, well obviously
that's important,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.400
but the role of an anesthetist

13:10.400 --> 13:11.767
in an operation like yours,

13:11.767 --> 13:14.633
which is highly
specialized and intricate.

13:14.633 --> 13:15.867
- Having my Adenoids out.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.133
- [Edwina] Mum I need
to answer the phone.

13:17.133 --> 13:21.100
- I guess my point
is, when you go under

13:21.100 --> 13:24.067
a general anesthetic
your life is in my hands.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.067
- Bess, there's no
one on the front desk.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.300
Do you know where Edwina is?

13:27.300 --> 13:28.867
- Dr. Bandi I'm
coming, I'm sorry.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.800
- So my life is in your hands?

13:32.800 --> 13:33.967
- Oh you'll be fine.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.067
Sign this.

13:35.067 --> 13:35.933
See you Wednesday.

13:35.933 --> 13:38.100
(gunfire)

13:41.700 --> 13:42.533
- Mum!

13:44.633 --> 13:47.167
Mum! Do you want to go get-

13:47.167 --> 13:48.833
Do you want to go get
mani-pedis? My shout.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.433
- I can't, we have
to finish this off.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.733
- We got a cease
and desist letter

13:51.733 --> 13:52.967
from the internet
provider, so we

13:52.967 --> 13:54.833
have to finish all
of season seven.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.300
- You could just get Netflix.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.533
- That isn't free.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.133
- Yeah, the fine
won't be free either.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.500
- Which is why we've
gotta hurry up.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.067
- Hashtag workout.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.067
- Got it.

14:09.067 --> 14:10.400
- Hashtag gym life.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.233
- Got it.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.700
- Hashtag crazy abs.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.900
- [Briana] Got it.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.067
- Hey Briana, my
shout for mani-pedi?

14:15.067 --> 14:16.933
- Hashtag fireplace.

14:16.933 --> 14:18.133
- Fireplace?

14:18.133 --> 14:19.333
- Have you seen
how many fireplaces

14:19.333 --> 14:20.667
there are on Instagram?

14:20.667 --> 14:23.400
Plus, fireplace equals hot.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.833
- That is pure genius.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.433
You are a genius.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.133
Hashtag genius.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.700
Hashtag fire, hashtag place.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.067
- All right, all
right, all right,

14:37.067 --> 14:38.500
I took the last
three muesli bars,

14:38.500 --> 14:39.767
but only because
they were peppermint

14:39.767 --> 14:42.333
choc chip and you hate them.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.400
- What are you doing?

14:44.500 --> 14:45.333
- Nothing?

14:46.533 --> 14:48.400
Getting the car ready
for next month's meet.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.267
- Want some help?

14:52.633 --> 14:53.933
- No?

14:53.933 --> 14:56.067
- Good. Because I have
a heap of book work

14:56.067 --> 14:57.067
to catch up on.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.333
- Pretty intense huh?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.200
Welcome to the public system.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.867
Or ground zero as we call it.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.633
- Can I get one long
macchiato, one espresso,

15:11.633 --> 15:14.233
and two lukewarm soy
cafe lattes please.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.433
- Warts and all.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.067
- How different is this,
from sitting behind

15:17.067 --> 15:18.800
the desk in my rooms right?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.267
- Not very, I'm
not doing anything.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.700
- You are working with me.

15:21.700 --> 15:22.867
- You're not doing anything.

15:22.867 --> 15:23.900
Other than walking around these

15:23.900 --> 15:25.567
corridors really fast,

15:25.567 --> 15:27.467
are you pretending to
be on Grey's Anatomy?

15:27.467 --> 15:28.400
What's your problem?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.867
- I don't have a problem Edwina,

15:29.867 --> 15:32.333
but this country's public
health system certainly does,

15:32.333 --> 15:34.800
and so does the guy in the
next room waiting for surgery,

15:34.800 --> 15:37.300
and I am just responding
to both of them

15:37.300 --> 15:39.867
as quickly as I can.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.200
- Hey Bess, are you early?

15:42.100 --> 15:43.700
- To save lives?

15:43.700 --> 15:44.900
Don't think so.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.200
Just here to prep my girl.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.267
Sista.

15:49.267 --> 15:50.500
- Prep for what?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.400
- [Bess] So what happened?
He fell off a roof?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.233
- [Surgeon] Yep.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.667
- [Bess] Oh, that
leg looks nasty.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.800
You see that Edwina?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.567
Lotta blood.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.433
- I'll go and work in
the kitchen shall I?

16:12.767 --> 16:15.167
(both laugh)

16:17.400 --> 16:19.733
(music starts)

16:19.733 --> 16:21.567
- What the fuck is that?

16:21.567 --> 16:22.933
- It's trip hop.

16:22.933 --> 16:24.900
- They were the headliners
at the festival.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.333
- My stereo, my
Maroon 5 playlist.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.767
- Well, then we're lucky

16:28.767 --> 16:31.433
it's playing from
Ashley's stereo.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.467
- [Briana] Turn to me.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.600
- Hey.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.800
- Crunch it.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.100
Tighter, tighter, tighter!

16:44.867 --> 16:46.800
- What is that smell?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.067
- Fish oil.

16:48.067 --> 16:48.900
For the glisten.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.433
Crunch it!

16:56.967 --> 16:59.333
(exhales)

16:59.333 --> 17:02.600
(explosions and gunfire)

17:02.600 --> 17:04.200
- Do you reckon
that's loud enough?

17:04.200 --> 17:05.567
- Good isn't it?

17:05.567 --> 17:09.200
Kayne put in another subwoofer.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.400
You feel that?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.200
When he revs it it
goes right through you,

17:15.200 --> 17:17.133
oh there's another one.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.300
- What are you doing?

17:25.300 --> 17:27.900
- Checking for trip hop,
soft porn photography,

17:27.900 --> 17:30.100
motorcycle outlaws.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.667
- I don't know what that means.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.133
- All clear.

17:34.133 --> 17:34.967
- Sweet.

17:38.867 --> 17:42.100
(angle grinder starts)

17:45.300 --> 17:48.133
(noises continue)

17:54.467 --> 17:57.733
(noises suddenly stop)

18:01.700 --> 18:02.767
- Did we not pay?

18:02.767 --> 18:03.600
- Why are you asking me?

18:03.600 --> 18:04.933
Amber!

18:04.933 --> 18:06.300
- Did we change electricity
companies again?

18:06.300 --> 18:07.800
- No, remember
Amber said that if

18:07.800 --> 18:09.567
that guy rang the doorbell
during dinner again

18:09.567 --> 18:11.267
she'd ram the contract
up his jacksie

18:11.267 --> 18:12.733
every month for 24 months.

18:12.733 --> 18:14.267
- Where's mum? Did
she forget to pay?

18:14.267 --> 18:16.100
- Don't be so rude, of course

18:16.100 --> 18:17.567
I didn't forget to pay.

18:17.567 --> 18:18.933
- Oh it must have shorted then.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.433
- Please can we switch
to three phase mum?

18:21.433 --> 18:22.967
- I can only weld
once you've all

18:22.967 --> 18:23.900
gone to bed.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.500
- I turned off the power.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.700
- Why?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.200
- I wanted your
undivided attention.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.967
- That's actually a very
good way of getting it.

18:29.967 --> 18:31.400
- I want my house back,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.733
I want my own space,
there is no room

18:33.733 --> 18:35.233
in this house for me.

18:35.233 --> 18:37.067
- Well maybe it's time to do

18:37.067 --> 18:38.667
something about that.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.633
- Are we extending?

18:39.633 --> 18:41.100
- We don't need to extend,

18:41.100 --> 18:43.267
we just need the
hanger-onners to clear out.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.267
- I don't think
it's them who need

18:45.267 --> 18:46.433
to move out Amber.

18:48.767 --> 18:51.767
- [Bess] So Cath, with
the muscle laceration

18:51.767 --> 18:53.433
in the leg, I guess
you're just going

18:53.433 --> 18:55.433
to suture epimysium
to epimysium.

18:55.433 --> 18:56.933
- [Cath] Mm.

18:56.933 --> 18:59.100
- [Bess] Hard though isn't
it? With lacerated tendons,

18:59.100 --> 19:00.467
whether to know to
repair partially,

19:00.467 --> 19:02.267
or just leave them altogether.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.733
- [Cath] Uh huh.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.067
- [Bess] Would you consider
a bio-mechanical repair?

19:05.067 --> 19:06.467
Maybe harvested tissue?

19:06.467 --> 19:08.233
- [Cath] What is wrong with you?

19:08.233 --> 19:09.500
- [Bess] Nothing.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.433
- [Cath] Can we do
what we usually do

19:10.433 --> 19:12.133
and talk about The Bachelor?

19:12.133 --> 19:14.867
(tray crash)

19:14.867 --> 19:19.100
(muffled music and
angle grinding)

19:30.667 --> 19:31.767
- Should have said
something sooner

19:31.767 --> 19:32.833
if you hated having me living

19:32.833 --> 19:33.767
here so much.

19:33.767 --> 19:34.900
- I'm not the one who hates it.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.100
- I don't hate it.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.367
- You only moved
back in because you

19:37.367 --> 19:40.100
broke up with Troy
and maybe, somewhere,

19:40.100 --> 19:42.967
you thought that when
you moved back out

19:42.967 --> 19:45.133
it would be with Troy again?

19:45.133 --> 19:46.267
Now that's not going to happen

19:46.267 --> 19:47.500
you've got to do it on your own.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.333
Sweetie,

19:49.867 --> 19:51.067
you've got to move out.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.067
And move on.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.767
- Is that why you said
Ashley could stay?

19:56.767 --> 19:57.600
- Maybe.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.133
- I'm scared.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.200
- You know,

20:04.200 --> 20:05.567
I never guessed that in the

20:05.567 --> 20:08.100
whole two years you
were living here.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.533
It's okay, it's okay.

20:14.167 --> 20:16.600
There's someone
out there for you.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.200
You're not going
to find him living

20:18.200 --> 20:19.333
in the bungalow.

20:21.067 --> 20:23.033
- [Wayne] You
should go on Pinder.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.633
- It's called Tinder dad.

20:24.633 --> 20:26.400
- You're getting mixed
up with Pintrest.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.167
- Pintrest? Is that the gay one?

20:28.167 --> 20:33.167
- No.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.400
- Do you want a bite?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.933
(upbeat music)

20:41.767 --> 20:44.233
(phone rings)

20:47.700 --> 20:48.500
- Mum.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.833
- Bess, what's wrong?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.133
- You called me.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.400
- No I didn't.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.267
- You've accidentally
FaceTimed me again.

20:55.267 --> 20:57.733
- Rubbish, that's how
they hike up the bills,

20:57.733 --> 20:59.700
I just picked up my
phone to check the time,

20:59.700 --> 21:01.800
I can't sleep, Pat
snores like a mad drunk.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.067
Is that Edwina?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.067
- She hit her head
after she fainted

21:07.067 --> 21:08.933
in the operating theater,
she's no concussed,

21:08.933 --> 21:11.233
she's just tired
because I made her do

21:11.233 --> 21:12.700
the night shift with me.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.633
- Why?

21:13.633 --> 21:14.700
- Because, I want her to think

21:14.700 --> 21:16.533
that my job is inspiring.

21:16.533 --> 21:17.467
- Of course it is.

21:17.467 --> 21:18.700
- Well she doesn't think so,

21:18.700 --> 21:21.067
she only thinks that
Josephine Cantenouche

21:21.067 --> 21:22.200
is inspiring.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.900
- Ooh, is she the
conjoined twins doctor?

21:24.900 --> 21:26.233
- Not you too?

21:26.233 --> 21:28.100
(snoring)

21:28.100 --> 21:29.467
- She's a teenager
Bess, she doesn't

21:29.467 --> 21:31.267
have to approve of you.

21:31.267 --> 21:32.133
- I know.

21:32.133 --> 21:33.500
- No you don't know,

21:33.500 --> 21:35.100
you made her do the night shift!

21:36.300 --> 21:39.500
I have to go, I have
to roll Pat over again.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.067
- [Danny] Still asleep?

21:43.067 --> 21:44.267
- I am sorry.

21:44.267 --> 21:45.967
- Stop apologizing,
who knew Eddy

21:45.967 --> 21:49.067
would be so squeamish
after seeing a severed leg.

21:49.067 --> 21:50.833
- I knew, Edwina's a wuss.

21:50.833 --> 21:51.733
- I am not.

21:52.933 --> 21:54.167
- [Bess] How're
you going sweetie?

21:54.167 --> 21:55.767
- Fine, and I'm not a wuss.

21:55.767 --> 21:56.600
You would have fainted too,

21:56.600 --> 21:57.567
so would dad.

21:57.567 --> 21:58.833
- I don't know about that.

21:58.833 --> 22:00.467
- You fainted when
you got a blood nose

22:00.467 --> 22:01.800
at Oscar's soccer match.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.533
- Classic ref moment hey dad?

22:03.533 --> 22:04.867
- That was more from shock,

22:04.867 --> 22:06.700
Caspian had no right
to take that free kick,

22:06.700 --> 22:08.167
I was still setting up the wall.

22:08.167 --> 22:09.467
- Blood everywhere.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.167
Yeah, and you
mysteriously disappeared

22:11.167 --> 22:12.633
to the toilets for half an hour.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.067
Mum was the only one
who could handle it.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.067
- Yes, but she's trained.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.067
- Exactly, she's highly trained,

22:17.067 --> 22:18.267
and we're all fainters.

22:18.267 --> 22:20.067
- I didn't faint, I
hid in the toilets.

22:20.067 --> 22:21.233
- Splitting hairs mate.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.700
- She has studied to
know how to keep people

22:22.700 --> 22:24.633
alive in an operating theater.

22:24.633 --> 22:26.167
Do you realize what that means?

22:26.167 --> 22:28.600
- No, why don't you elaborate
for Oscar's benefit.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.833
- Her job is to concentrate on
that person's consciousness.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.600
Not to be focused on
the blood like I was

22:33.600 --> 22:36.067
or you were. It's a high
level skill you idiot.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.633
- Don't call your
brother an idiot.

22:38.633 --> 22:41.933
He, like a lot of
people has a slightly

22:41.933 --> 22:44.133
simplistic view
of my profession,

22:44.133 --> 22:48.100
and I have learnt not to
be upset by ignorance.

22:49.633 --> 22:51.200
So do you think you'd like to be

22:51.200 --> 22:52.067
an anesthetist?

22:52.067 --> 22:53.100
- Do I still get paid?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.667
(upbeat music)

22:58.400 --> 22:59.200
- Oi.

23:01.133 --> 23:03.167
You're not taking that with you.

23:03.167 --> 23:04.600
- What am I supposed
to sleep on?

23:04.600 --> 23:05.867
- This.

23:05.867 --> 23:08.833
Happy house warming

23:08.833 --> 23:10.200
- Which credit card did you use?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.900
- No, we drew down on our super.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.200
- How much was the bed?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.733
- Well we didn't
have a lot of super.

23:15.733 --> 23:16.800
- We thought you
needed something

23:16.800 --> 23:17.900
to help get things started.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.733
You know, tinder works out.

23:19.733 --> 23:20.967
- Mum!

23:20.967 --> 23:22.700
- That's why we got you
the best, memory foam,

23:22.700 --> 23:24.767
tested by NASA, and
used by patients

23:24.767 --> 23:26.667
with bed sores in Scandinavia.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.200
- Just stick to the
NASA stuff love.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
Hey Kayne, can you
get this on the truck?

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
- Freeze!

23:33.400 --> 23:34.267
And clench.

23:35.300 --> 23:36.400
Yes.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.900
We're doing calves this month.

23:38.900 --> 23:40.267
- Gonna miss you you idiot.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.067
- It's gonna be great,

23:44.067 --> 23:46.367
we'll see each
other all the time.

23:46.367 --> 23:48.067
- You sure you're okay to
bring that bookcase over?

23:48.067 --> 23:49.067
- Totes.

23:49.067 --> 23:50.233
- Hey, maybe we keep the old bed

23:50.233 --> 23:51.367
for the spare room
in the new house

23:51.367 --> 23:52.900
for when Ashley comes to stay.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.533
Mum?

23:56.533 --> 23:57.367
Mum!

23:57.367 --> 23:58.667
- Okay let's do this.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.200
(upbeat music)

24:42.467 --> 24:44.067
- So, I've decided
I'm not going to

24:44.067 --> 24:45.300
spend the money I
earned working with

24:45.300 --> 24:46.500
you on a bed.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.567
- Really?

24:47.567 --> 24:48.700
- Yeah.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.600
I'm going to save that money.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.500
- Priorities huh?

24:52.500 --> 24:54.067
- Yes.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.400
And also I'm getting
Amber's old one.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.367
- Amber's old what?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.933
- A queen fit for a princess.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.167
- Wait, what?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.833
- No, don't ruin your
toes love, we've got it.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.833
(theme music plays)
