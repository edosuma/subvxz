01:06.965 --> 01:08.630
Uhh!

01:11.465 --> 01:12.897
Uhh...

01:39.975 --> 01:41.908
This must feel like
slumming to you,

01:41.975 --> 01:44.340
speaking at my lowly
graduate seminar.

01:44.408 --> 01:47.538
Well, someone's got to set your
students straight about my work.

01:47.606 --> 01:48.839
Just pointing out
the flaws.

01:48.906 --> 01:50.406
And you're doing
a fine job.

01:50.474 --> 01:52.307
Have you two always
been like this?

01:52.374 --> 01:54.341
No, we're far more
civil now.

01:54.409 --> 01:56.909
I'd like to have seen
Lightman at Oxford.

01:56.977 --> 02:00.244
Yes. Back when he was a
real student of psychology.

02:00.312 --> 02:02.778
Are you sure you want me
sabotaging your students?

02:02.846 --> 02:04.779
No, but I don't have
another lecture ready,

02:04.847 --> 02:06.347
so you're on.

02:06.415 --> 02:07.847
Fine.

02:07.915 --> 02:09.282
Because
people have got to know

02:09.350 --> 02:10.782
whether or not their
president's a crook.

02:10.850 --> 02:12.351
Well, I'm not a crook.

02:12.418 --> 02:15.353
I've earned
everything I've got.

02:15.421 --> 02:17.188
I love this guy.

02:17.255 --> 02:21.257
You see how he's looking
down and he's nodding?

02:21.325 --> 02:23.225
He's contradicting
his own statement.

02:23.293 --> 02:26.860
He hesitates before saying
he's earned everything he's got.

02:26.927 --> 02:28.461
And notice
the crossed arms.

02:28.528 --> 02:30.262
He's defensive.

02:30.329 --> 02:32.363
Which means
he's full of it.

02:34.265 --> 02:38.200
He's not nodding his head.
He's looking down at his notes.

02:38.268 --> 02:40.369
Being defensive
doesn't mean you're lying.

02:40.437 --> 02:44.035
Well, one of these things by itself
may not be conclusive,

02:44.103 --> 02:46.298
but when you put them together,
they add up to deception.

02:46.366 --> 02:48.262
Yeah, or you're looking
for things to prove deception

02:48.330 --> 02:49.996
so you find them.

02:50.063 --> 02:52.530
And if Lincoln were showing
in the same behaviors,
would you say he was lying?

02:52.598 --> 02:55.099
I'd say he was Nixon
in a Lincoln mask.

02:56.867 --> 02:58.864
All right, let's do
a practical demonstration

02:58.932 --> 03:01.299
and then you guys
can see for yourself.

03:01.367 --> 03:02.633
We need a volunteer.

03:02.701 --> 03:04.801
How about you?
Mister, um...

03:04.868 --> 03:06.002
Martin.

03:06.069 --> 03:08.303
Martin Walker.

03:08.371 --> 03:10.037
Right.

03:12.306 --> 03:14.706
So, I've got 10 pictures.

03:14.774 --> 03:17.308
Pick one, then lie about what
you're seeing r tell the truth,

03:17.376 --> 03:19.542
and Dr. Lightman
will read you.

03:25.380 --> 03:27.313
What about stakes?

03:27.381 --> 03:29.214
I read your book,
Dr. Lightman.

03:29.282 --> 03:31.916
Without stakes,
it's hard to spot a lie.

03:31.984 --> 03:34.318
There's no fear
of being caught.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.818
All right.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.320
100 bucks says I can read you
like a book.

03:38.388 --> 03:39.821
Mm-hmm.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.557
All right.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.760
A pretty girl.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.329
College age, I'd say.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.331
Ponytail. Blonde.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.566
Big eyes.

03:56.901 --> 03:59.569
And pale, pink blouse.

04:00.905 --> 04:03.906
You like the ladies,
Martin?

04:03.974 --> 04:06.508
Yeah. What's not to like?

04:09.278 --> 04:11.078
In that case, you're talking
out your ass,

04:11.146 --> 04:15.514
'cause whatever you're seeing there
you don't like it.

04:32.053 --> 04:34.021
What do you say now,
Dr. Lightman?

04:35.857 --> 04:37.291
Double or quits.

04:37.359 --> 04:39.026
Ooh!

04:51.835 --> 04:54.236
Guy tied to a chair.

04:54.304 --> 04:56.805
He's soaking wet.

04:56.872 --> 04:59.908
Being zapped
with electric cables,

04:59.976 --> 05:02.877
like you'd use to
jump start a car.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.483
Total rubbish.

05:26.197 --> 05:29.761
Ok. I think that's it for
today's class.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.428
Our thanks to
Dr. Lightman.

05:31.494 --> 05:33.759
Always entertaining
and fascinating.

05:38.263 --> 05:40.496
We'll have to
do this again.

05:42.332 --> 05:44.768
A bad day
for Lightman way.

05:44.836 --> 05:46.770
Hey. Where
are you going?

05:46.838 --> 05:48.772
Did you put him
up to this?

05:48.839 --> 05:50.273
How could I do that?

05:50.341 --> 05:53.008
I mean, your technique
is foolproof, right?

05:58.347 --> 05:59.713
Yeah.

05:59.781 --> 06:01.715
Here's the problem.

06:01.783 --> 06:04.217
Martin Walker's
a psychopath,

06:04.285 --> 06:06.219
probably a killer.

06:06.287 --> 06:08.121
Just thought you should know.

06:40.313 --> 06:43.584
Right. In a healthy kid,
you would expect to get

06:43.652 --> 06:48.194
arousal and revulsion.

06:48.262 --> 06:53.266
What we got in Martin
was revulsion and arousal.

06:53.334 --> 06:56.269
Revulsion can
appear to be arousal.

06:56.337 --> 06:57.771
Markers are similar.

06:57.838 --> 07:00.003
It says so right
in your book, Cal.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.938
Those pictures aren't proof
of anything, Dr. Lightman.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.206
No, look. We saw the same indicators
in Ted Bundy.

07:05.274 --> 07:06.474
Oh, Bundy?

07:06.542 --> 07:08.209
Yeah, he was
a good-looking fella,

07:08.276 --> 07:10.710
killed about 60 women,
give or take.

07:10.777 --> 07:13.112
Dr. Lightman is
prone to the dramatic.

07:13.179 --> 07:14.713
Aren't we all?

07:14.781 --> 07:17.716
Oh, please! Martin exposed
your science to be flawed.

07:17.783 --> 07:19.884
So what, therefore
he has to be punished?

07:19.952 --> 07:23.120
Dr. Foster, do you concur
with your colleague?

07:23.188 --> 07:26.156
I didn't see
what he saw,

07:26.224 --> 07:29.092
but reading facial cues
isn't my specialty.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.228
Well, it is mine,

07:31.295 --> 07:34.731
and I suggest you bring him
in for psych evaluation.

07:34.799 --> 07:35.999
Without something
more substantial,

07:36.067 --> 07:38.134
I can't justify
that kind of action.

07:38.202 --> 07:42.670
All right. If the university isn't
looking into at least

07:42.738 --> 07:47.673
one missing persons
case, I'll eat my shoes.

07:47.741 --> 07:51.743
Oh, yeah. I think
I'm on to something here.

07:51.811 --> 07:53.742
A sophomore girl
went missing a month ago.

07:53.810 --> 07:56.744
The police have no
evidence of foul play.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.912
It's an open case,
and they don't have any leads.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.147
Except the one
I'm giving you.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.182
I'll ask the police
to talk to him,

08:03.249 --> 08:04.616
but quietly.

08:04.684 --> 08:08.185
In other words,
you'll do sod all.

08:08.253 --> 08:10.053
Just say it.

08:10.121 --> 08:12.121
I haven't got a clue
what you're on about.

08:12.189 --> 08:13.555
Ok, fine. I'll
say it for you.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.123
You're mad I didn't
back you up.

08:15.191 --> 08:16.691
But Cal, I didn't
see what you saw.

08:16.759 --> 08:18.126
Beating you
a couple of times

08:18.193 --> 08:19.528
doesn't make
him a psychopath.

08:19.596 --> 08:20.864
Once. He only
beat me once.

08:20.932 --> 08:22.702
Second time,
I let him win

08:22.770 --> 08:24.707
because I wanted to see
how much he got off

08:24.774 --> 08:26.609
on the humiliating me.

08:26.677 --> 08:28.713
All right, there's a
lot of people out there

08:28.780 --> 08:29.981
might enjoy doing that,

08:30.049 --> 08:33.150
but they all know me.
He doesn't.

08:33.217 --> 08:36.220
So yeah, I'm going to
need his medical files

08:36.288 --> 08:38.554
and any psychological
profile that might exist.

08:38.621 --> 08:40.222
You know that those
are confidential.

08:40.291 --> 08:41.724
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:41.792 --> 08:43.159
No time for ethics
on this one.

08:43.227 --> 08:45.031
Cal, you're
crossing that line.

08:45.098 --> 08:46.665
Helen's already
crossed it.

08:47.734 --> 08:50.735
One should not shag
one's students,

08:50.803 --> 08:52.970
especially not the
psychopathic ones.

08:54.806 --> 08:57.240
I never said
I saw aliens.

08:57.308 --> 08:59.242
I saw an unidentified
flying object.

08:59.309 --> 09:01.544
Now, what is so
loony about that?

09:01.611 --> 09:04.613
Well, school board is gonna say
there's a lot loony about it.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.348
I'm not crazy,
Miss Torres.

09:06.415 --> 09:09.184
Frankly, corroborating your story
is gonna be a little difficult.

09:09.251 --> 09:11.185
What did it look like?

09:11.253 --> 09:14.188
The overall Gestalt
of the thing was, uh...

09:14.255 --> 09:17.924
Was like a hockey puck
or a jelly doughnut.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.698
Were you drinking
or taking any medication?

09:23.766 --> 09:25.702
I was as dry
as the Sahara.

09:25.770 --> 09:28.608
Would you describe
what you saw as extraterrestrial?

09:32.083 --> 09:37.222
Look, when the Greeks
saw lightning in the sky,

09:37.290 --> 09:40.158
they attributed it
to Zeus, all right?

09:40.226 --> 09:43.729
And when the Aborigines
witnessed Halley's Comet,

09:43.796 --> 09:47.666
they thought it was
a mighty shaman.

09:47.734 --> 09:50.736
That's the trap
that always ensnares us--

09:50.804 --> 09:52.671
the need to explain.

09:52.739 --> 09:55.740
Well, this UFO claim
seems like it's part of a pattern.

09:55.808 --> 09:59.411
***

09:59.478 --> 10:03.181
Then there was a 3am comet gazing
workshop you held on the roof

10:03.248 --> 10:05.316
of the gentlemens' lounge.

10:05.384 --> 10:08.152
It was a strip club,
but it had the best view.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.254
We're not here to assess his lesson
planning, Ria.

10:10.322 --> 10:14.759
When I saw the UFO,
I called the local news.

10:14.826 --> 10:18.095
I called the airport.
I called Maddox Air Force Base.

10:18.163 --> 10:19.663
I got stonewalled.

10:19.731 --> 10:24.201
Then somehow word got out that
I'm proselytizing about little green men

10:24.269 --> 10:26.203
in the classroom,
which I'm not.

10:26.271 --> 10:29.773
Oh, you're adding conspiracy theory to
your close encounter?

10:29.841 --> 10:31.274
Can you give us a sec?

10:31.342 --> 10:33.009
Sure.

10:34.779 --> 10:36.279
I'm seeing how he
reacts to an attack.

10:36.347 --> 10:37.781
Lightman 101.

10:37.849 --> 10:39.783
Is he showing any
markers of deception?

10:39.851 --> 10:41.785
You really want to
take this case?

10:41.852 --> 10:44.787
What, is the guy an eccentric? Yes.
Of course. Big time.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.688
And so am I. Have
you seen this shirt?

10:46.755 --> 10:48.989
But I think he's
being railroaded.

10:49.057 --> 10:52.292
Could he have really been the only
person to have seen something so...

10:52.360 --> 10:54.294
extraordinary?

10:54.362 --> 10:57.734
Listen, I stood in
front of the mirror,

10:57.802 --> 11:01.374
I've asked myself
"is this the face of a crackpot?"

11:01.441 --> 11:03.242
Well, maybe it is.

11:03.310 --> 11:06.679
But this crackpot is one
hell of a science teacher.

11:06.746 --> 11:10.650
I love my job
and I don't want to lose it.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.488
We're gonna do
everything we can.

11:22.963 --> 11:24.764
I thought you were
only here to humor me.

11:24.831 --> 11:26.265
Yeah, well, what do
you want from me?

11:26.333 --> 11:27.699
Old habits die hard.

11:27.767 --> 11:30.268
I'm writing down all the places that
we followed him to

11:30.335 --> 11:33.203
and writing down every thing that he
does in each spot.

11:33.271 --> 11:36.506
Well, you better make a note. He's
trolling for a victim.

11:43.914 --> 11:45.680
Cal, so's every
guy in this spot.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.215
He's 25, single.

11:47.283 --> 11:50.117
He's out the door
with that girl in 10 minutes.

11:50.185 --> 11:52.020
Any takers?

11:57.294 --> 12:00.296
I'll give you
a ride home in my car.

12:00.363 --> 12:03.164
You should alert
the local police about this one.

12:03.232 --> 12:04.566
And tell 'em what?

12:04.633 --> 12:06.234
There's a guy
going on a hot date?

12:06.301 --> 12:07.735
Here we go.

12:07.802 --> 12:09.169
Well, he made us.

12:09.237 --> 12:11.238
It's about bloody
time and all.

12:11.306 --> 12:13.740
You having fun
playing Detective?

12:13.808 --> 12:17.477
This is Ben Reynolds
of the FBI.

12:18.579 --> 12:20.679
Is he gonna give me
a parking ticket?

12:20.747 --> 12:24.483
We can't have you hurting that girl,
now can we, Martin?

12:24.550 --> 12:26.718
She's safe enough.

12:26.785 --> 12:28.986
Now she is, yeah.

13:09.935 --> 13:12.103
Hello, Martin.

13:16.441 --> 13:17.808
You knew I was coming.

13:17.876 --> 13:19.376
Yeah, that's what
predators do.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.278
They check out
their territory.

13:22.446 --> 13:25.381
You killed that missing girl,
didn't you?

13:25.448 --> 13:26.815
Of course not.

13:26.883 --> 13:28.817
I'm harmless.

13:28.885 --> 13:32.120
Now I know I'm right.

13:33.522 --> 13:37.391
I must admit, you had me going there,
just for a minute.

13:37.459 --> 13:41.392
The police talked to me
today about the missing girl,

13:41.460 --> 13:42.894
but you knew that.

13:42.962 --> 13:44.562
What about
that girl tonight?

13:44.630 --> 13:46.399
And what were you
gonna do to her?

13:46.467 --> 13:48.401
Oh, I was just gonna
give her a ride home,

13:48.468 --> 13:50.903
like a good Samaritan.

13:50.971 --> 13:53.406
Thanks to you,
she had to walk.

13:53.473 --> 13:55.642
I hope she made it OK.

13:56.978 --> 14:01.212
So are you just gonna
follow me the rest of my life?

14:01.280 --> 14:04.079
I won't have to.
You'll mess up.

14:05.915 --> 14:09.350
You know what my
dissertation was on?

14:09.417 --> 14:13.353
How patience is adaptive.

14:13.421 --> 14:15.355
Hunters are at the
top of the food chain,

14:15.423 --> 14:17.357
and they all
take their time.

14:17.425 --> 14:19.093
Patience...

14:20.929 --> 14:23.365
I find is overrated.

14:23.433 --> 14:26.370
I noticed.
You like to push

14:26.437 --> 14:28.805
to make things happen.

14:28.873 --> 14:30.541
That's when people trip up.

14:30.609 --> 14:32.810
Most people.

14:32.878 --> 14:34.778
You're gonna
lose this game.

14:34.846 --> 14:36.246
It's not a game,
Martin.

14:36.314 --> 14:37.547
Sure, it is.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.882
You love it
just as much as I do.

14:39.950 --> 14:42.315
I see it.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.115
You're leaking joy.

14:45.950 --> 14:48.317
I tell you what,
you beat me,

14:48.385 --> 14:51.116
and I'll even give
you back your 200 bucks.

14:55.584 --> 14:58.185
Good chess players
think 5 moves ahead.

14:58.253 --> 15:01.755
Great chess players
think one move ahead,

15:01.823 --> 15:04.557
but it's always
the right move.

15:14.398 --> 15:16.365
All right,
I want these everywhere.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.334
Hallways, coffee shop,

15:18.402 --> 15:19.836
bookstore--any empty
space, all right?

15:19.903 --> 15:21.837
Ok.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.338
Very subtle.

15:23.406 --> 15:24.773
Plan to stick
around for the lawsuit?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.341
No. It's just where
I want the man.

15:26.409 --> 15:27.842
In a courtroom.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.343
Oh, really, Cal.

15:29.411 --> 15:30.844
When did you become
such a Fascist?

15:30.912 --> 15:33.847
Pentagon, 2003,
among other places.

15:33.914 --> 15:35.848
It shows.
We both know

15:35.915 --> 15:37.348
this is not
about Martin.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.350
This is about us.

15:39.418 --> 15:41.285
"Us" was 23 years ago.

15:41.352 --> 15:43.019
I think I'm over it.

15:43.087 --> 15:45.788
Interesting how you remember
the exact number of years.

15:45.856 --> 15:48.355
Yes, bloody fascinating,
isn't it?

15:48.423 --> 15:49.955
You cannot quantify
behavior, Cal,

15:50.023 --> 15:51.857
which is what you're trying to
introduce to people.

15:51.924 --> 15:53.358
No, look.
I provide a tool.

15:53.426 --> 15:55.761
All right, people
misuse that tool,

15:55.829 --> 15:57.297
it's not my fault.

15:57.365 --> 15:58.965
Look at Martin,
all right?

15:59.033 --> 16:01.234
He is a loony.

16:01.302 --> 16:03.303
All right,
and if I'm right,

16:03.371 --> 16:04.705
you could be putting
these women in danger.

16:04.773 --> 16:06.239
And if you're wrong...

16:06.307 --> 16:08.041
I'll recycle.

16:09.310 --> 16:11.143
One thing about
Cal is he's--

16:11.211 --> 16:12.311
insufferable.

16:12.379 --> 16:15.314
No--well, yes,
sometimes.

16:16.882 --> 16:18.316
Has he always
been like this?

16:18.384 --> 16:21.819
Yes, only more so.

16:21.887 --> 16:24.321
A word?

16:24.389 --> 16:26.256
He is not someone
for the long haul.

16:26.323 --> 16:27.823
Oh, no, no.
We're not a--

16:27.891 --> 16:30.825
just keep your
distance,

16:30.893 --> 16:34.395
or you could find yourself
a very lonely woman.

16:38.399 --> 16:40.333
One time
he brought in these kittens

16:40.401 --> 16:42.335
and said we should
dissect them.

16:42.403 --> 16:45.337
And this girl Lisa completely
freaked and called the cops.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.340
But he was just teaching us
to question authority.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.976
Did Mr. Hickson ever
say anything about aliens?

16:52.044 --> 16:53.845
Well, he said
he saw something

16:53.912 --> 16:55.346
and asked us
what it could have been.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.847
And flying saucer
made it on the list?

16:56.915 --> 16:58.015
Yeah.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.016
Right underneath
the magic brownies?

17:03.754 --> 17:06.722
You didn't think
that was funny, Andre?

17:06.790 --> 17:09.691
'Cause that thing you did where
you just looked down and away,

17:09.759 --> 17:11.291
that's regret.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.093
Ease up on the Jedi mind tricks,
OK, everyone?

17:13.161 --> 17:14.795
You don't know me.

17:14.862 --> 17:20.398
Well, maybe you are the person who
told people that Mr. Hickson saw aliens.

17:20.467 --> 17:23.268
Look, all right, I didn't say nothin'
and I ain't on trial.

17:23.336 --> 17:24.803
Andre.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.303
Andre.

17:26.371 --> 17:29.238
Hey, Andre.

17:29.306 --> 17:32.307
What's with the shame?

17:32.375 --> 17:34.209
Did you see the same
thing Hickson saw?

17:34.277 --> 17:36.310
I didn't see anything.

17:36.378 --> 17:40.816
Hey, look. You can
either sack up right now,

17:40.883 --> 17:42.116
or you can spend the
rest of your l

17:42.184 --> 17:44.384
wondering if what
you saw was real

17:44.452 --> 17:47.053
and if you could have
saved Mr. Hickson's job.

17:52.391 --> 17:54.058
It was real.

17:59.397 --> 18:01.133
You like Mr. Hickson,
so you photoshopped it.

18:01.201 --> 18:05.000
Look, he didn't forge it.
That's exactly what I saw.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.768
Is the video real,
yes or no?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.503
Yes!

18:11.505 --> 18:13.005
Ok.

18:14.340 --> 18:15.774
Well, if this is
what you saw,

18:15.841 --> 18:17.175
it must have been
picked up on radar.

18:17.242 --> 18:19.143
And not, then there's gotta
be an explanation.

18:19.210 --> 18:22.011
Yeah. Like the air
force don't be lyin'.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.281
We need to draw 'em out.
We need get something we can read.

18:26.349 --> 18:28.650
Well, how are you
gonna do that?

18:28.684 --> 18:30.017
Film at 11:00.

18:33.104 --> 18:35.038
Martin should be home
any minute now.

18:35.329 --> 18:37.830
It is so wonderful
you're considering him

18:37.898 --> 18:39.432
for the--
what do you call it?

18:39.500 --> 18:40.667
Lightman scholarship.

18:40.734 --> 18:41.767
Oh!

18:41.835 --> 18:46.339
It's our department's
most prestigious award.

18:46.406 --> 18:51.343
Every winner has to have
a biographical profile.

18:51.411 --> 18:54.346
Right? So...

18:54.413 --> 18:56.847
Should we start with
early childhood?

18:56.915 --> 18:59.783
Oh, Martin was
a very happy child,

18:59.851 --> 19:01.284
loved sports.

19:01.352 --> 19:04.387
Any head injuries?

19:04.454 --> 19:09.092
Trauma, like that?

19:09.160 --> 19:11.628
What we mean is, did he have
to overcome any difficulties

19:11.696 --> 19:13.096
as a child?

19:13.164 --> 19:14.798
Well, no, not really.

19:14.866 --> 19:16.800
Oh! Martin.

19:16.867 --> 19:21.304
The people are here from
the Lightman scholarship.

19:23.943 --> 19:25.777
No, mom.
They're lying to you.

19:25.845 --> 19:27.813
I don't--what?

19:27.881 --> 19:30.716
He has a grudge, mom.
He wants to destroy me.
Look at this.

19:30.784 --> 19:33.052
They're saying I hurt a girl.

19:35.601 --> 19:37.034
This is--
this is outrageous.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.901
I want you
out of my house.

19:38.968 --> 19:42.033
Well, don't you want
to know if it's true?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.466
Mrs. Walker,
a girl is missing.

19:44.533 --> 19:48.969
You can't believe
Martin would ever hurt anyone.

19:49.037 --> 19:50.470
Oh, she's not so sure.

19:50.538 --> 19:53.273
Me? I'd bet
your house on it.

19:58.110 --> 20:00.978
We should be
moseying along,

20:01.046 --> 20:02.913
unless of course there's anything
else you want to tell us.

20:02.981 --> 20:04.982
I've nothing to say to you.
I'm so sorry, Martin.

20:05.049 --> 20:06.917
I really didn't know
who they were.

20:06.985 --> 20:10.554
No, it's OK, mom.
I know it's not your fault.

20:11.956 --> 20:14.790
It's OK, mom.
They're going.

20:22.631 --> 20:25.065
You saw her when I said
he was guilty, right?

20:25.133 --> 20:26.567
She crumbled.

20:26.634 --> 20:28.502
She was taken
by surprise, Cal.

20:28.569 --> 20:31.504
Surprise, my ass.
She's scared to death of him.

20:31.572 --> 20:34.073
She knows
he's guilty, too.

20:34.141 --> 20:38.076
Cal, maybe you are
seeing what you want to see.

20:38.143 --> 20:40.310
You buying his act,
are you?

20:42.146 --> 20:45.081
I think you and Helen
have a lot of unresolved issues.

20:45.149 --> 20:48.016
I think you two were a couple when
you were her student,

20:48.084 --> 20:51.020
and I don't think you
like your replacement.

20:51.088 --> 20:54.089
You know, you're starting to sound
a lot like Helen.

20:54.156 --> 20:56.591
I mean that in
the nicest possible way.

20:56.658 --> 20:58.592
When I'm sure you're
right about Martin,

20:58.660 --> 21:00.260
I will back you 100%.

21:00.328 --> 21:01.962
Oh, yeah.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.031
Here. Maybe this'll
help convince you.

21:05.099 --> 21:07.267
It was just
laying about.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.039
He has a sister?

21:13.107 --> 21:14.474
Apparently, yeah.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.543
There's not a single picture
of her in the house, though,

21:16.610 --> 21:18.545
not that I could
see anyway.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.547
What is this?

21:20.615 --> 21:24.551
That is video
of little Martin

21:24.619 --> 21:26.988
and presumably
an older sister.

21:27.055 --> 21:29.357
And where did you
get it from?

21:29.425 --> 21:31.059
Borrowed it.

21:31.127 --> 21:32.493
Is that the background?

21:32.561 --> 21:34.991
Yeah, and I didn't have
to break any laws to get it. Here.

21:35.059 --> 21:36.926
Well, obviously,
Martin had a sister.

21:36.994 --> 21:39.061
Her name is Marcy.
She's 2 years older than him.

21:39.128 --> 21:41.062
Well, what
happened to her?

21:41.130 --> 21:42.563
She drowned in that pool
when she was 7.

21:44.132 --> 21:46.066
Police report says that Martin
witnessed the whole thing.

21:46.134 --> 21:48.068
Excuse me.
Reynolds here.

21:48.136 --> 21:50.003
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:50.070 --> 21:53.905
Well, Mrs. Walker lied about
Martin's happy childhood.

21:53.973 --> 21:56.040
You seeing
a pattern then?

21:56.108 --> 21:58.775
Cal, he was 5.

21:58.843 --> 22:00.910
2 1/2 times
the terrible 2s.

22:00.977 --> 22:03.011
What was the name
of that hospital again?

22:03.079 --> 22:04.679
All right, my man.
That was my buddy from the force.

22:04.747 --> 22:08.150
I asked him to keep his ear to the ground
about any missing women.

22:08.218 --> 22:09.818
There's another one?

22:09.886 --> 22:12.854
No, but a sophomore
at Chesapeake University
was attacked 2 days ago.

22:12.921 --> 22:14.522
Luckily, she was
able to get away.

22:14.589 --> 22:16.023
He thought there might
be a connection,

22:16.091 --> 22:17.524
so he decided to call me.

22:17.592 --> 22:19.459
Have the police
shown her the poster?

22:19.527 --> 22:23.263
No. She had a mental breakdown
and she isn't talking.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.434
What exactly is happening?
Thank you.

22:27.502 --> 22:30.538
Hey, look, I don't want to
be on camera. What are you--

22:30.605 --> 22:33.040
damn it!
I gotta go.

22:33.108 --> 22:36.042
Aw, man.
I am such a klutz.

22:36.110 --> 22:38.043
I--oh, geez.
I left my opposable thumbs at home.

22:38.110 --> 22:39.277
Let me buy you
another one.

22:39.345 --> 22:40.478
No, it's OK.

22:40.546 --> 22:42.046
No, really,
it's not. Here.

22:42.114 --> 22:44.547
Another one of what I just spilled
and a raspberry tart.

22:44.615 --> 22:46.548
You OK with raspberry?

22:46.616 --> 22:49.284
Yeah, sure.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.183
A lot of action, huh?

22:53.251 --> 22:55.185
No, no, no.
Usually just dull stuff.

22:55.982 --> 22:57.915
Old ladies
smuggling perfume.

22:57.983 --> 22:59.283
Mmm. Well,
maybe dull is good.

22:59.351 --> 23:01.917
Whatever you're doing now is
stressing you out.

23:01.985 --> 23:04.718
Ha! Yeah,
it's ironic.

23:04.786 --> 23:06.853
I'm usually the one to read people,
but you're right.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.354
I am stressed.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.289
Then you need to relax.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.358
You know, I'm going to
a concert tomorrow night.

23:13.426 --> 23:17.362
Mostly Vivaldi.
You want to come?

23:19.432 --> 23:21.299
Um...

23:21.367 --> 23:24.370
It doesn't have to be
like a date or anything.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.605
You could meet me there.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.877
No, yeah. I'd
really like to go.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.112
Let me give you
my number.

23:41.450 --> 23:44.119
Did I mention
I know your boss?

23:46.189 --> 23:47.623
What?

23:49.359 --> 23:52.895
See, he thinks I'm
some kind of psycho killer.

23:52.963 --> 23:56.131
I get women alone,
attack them.

23:58.902 --> 24:00.335
What do you want?

24:00.403 --> 24:01.837
To make a point.

24:01.904 --> 24:04.272
And what point
would that be?

24:04.340 --> 24:07.575
If Lightman was right about me,
you'd already be dead.

24:13.148 --> 24:15.849
So, to be clear,
the Lightman group

24:15.917 --> 24:20.187
is putting its hard-won reputation
on the line for a UFO sighting?

24:20.255 --> 24:22.590
Now that we have
a second eyewitness

24:22.657 --> 24:24.124
and physical evidence,

24:24.192 --> 24:27.227
we think that it's time
that we got some answers
from our government.

24:27.295 --> 24:30.364
Aren't you worried this could become
a national security issue?

24:30.432 --> 24:32.800
If the Air Force is
telling me the truth

24:32.867 --> 24:35.802
and they didn't pick up
an object this size,

24:35.870 --> 24:38.204
then we've already
got a huge problem.

24:38.272 --> 24:40.874
Mr. Hickson is
telling the truth.

24:40.941 --> 24:43.810
When you know that,
why not bet the ranch?

24:43.878 --> 24:48.114
I'm gonna show you
a picture, OK?

24:49.950 --> 24:53.386
Is this the man
who attacked you?

24:53.453 --> 24:55.621
Valerie?

24:58.825 --> 25:01.326
That's a yes.

25:01.394 --> 25:03.328
The police
interviewed Martin.

25:03.395 --> 25:04.828
Want to take a look
at this case file?

25:04.896 --> 25:06.829
Nah, they probably would let him go
with an apology.

25:06.897 --> 25:08.497
Yeah, you got that right.

25:08.565 --> 25:10.833
Hey.
Dummies.

25:10.901 --> 25:13.169
I thought you was off
chasing UFOs?

25:13.236 --> 25:15.271
Yeah, well, the office
told me where you were.

25:15.338 --> 25:18.340
That's him.
This guy. He--

25:18.408 --> 25:20.842
this guy--he just
bought me a cup of coffee

25:20.910 --> 25:24.846
and he was gonna
take me to a concert, but I was...

25:24.914 --> 25:27.518
How did you realize
that that was him?

25:27.587 --> 25:29.790
Ah, he said
he knew Lightman.

25:29.857 --> 25:32.757
Said that if he was
really the killer, I'd be dead.

25:33.926 --> 25:35.960
Is that the girl
he attacked?

25:36.028 --> 25:37.028
Oh, yeah.

25:37.095 --> 25:38.895
You OK?

25:38.963 --> 25:41.598
Yeah, she'll be fine.

25:42.866 --> 25:45.201
Well, now you're here,
make yourself useful.

25:45.268 --> 25:49.604
Go in there and bond with Valerie
over being alive.

25:54.141 --> 25:55.874
I understand,
Valerie.

25:55.942 --> 25:59.311
What happened to you--
it almost happened to me, too.

25:59.378 --> 26:01.546
Look at me, Valerie.

26:02.881 --> 26:06.316
This guy bumped into
me at a pastry shop.

26:06.384 --> 26:08.818
By the time
we got outside,

26:08.886 --> 26:10.719
he felt like a friend.

26:10.786 --> 26:14.821
And that's what he does.
He appeals to who we are,

26:14.889 --> 26:18.057
like he sees us
when nobody else does.

26:20.893 --> 26:23.261
Look, I know
this is painful,

26:23.329 --> 26:25.831
but you're alive,
Valerie.

26:25.899 --> 26:28.434
The next girl
might not be.

26:37.710 --> 26:41.079
He drowned me...

26:45.416 --> 26:50.852
over and over.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.354
All that water.

26:54.422 --> 26:56.590
I died...

26:57.926 --> 26:59.527
3 times.

27:02.865 --> 27:04.600
Bastard
waterboarded her.

27:04.667 --> 27:07.035
I'm so sorry.

27:13.876 --> 27:16.310
And...

27:16.378 --> 27:19.814
When I would come to,

27:19.882 --> 27:23.051
his mouth
would be on mine.

27:24.887 --> 27:29.557
And then he would
do it again and again.

27:33.395 --> 27:37.565
I begged him to
just let me die...

27:40.836 --> 27:43.070
But he wouldn't.

27:45.908 --> 27:48.075
Maybe he did.

27:53.415 --> 27:55.850
Can you bring him in now?

27:55.917 --> 27:57.585
Hell, yeah.

28:02.857 --> 28:05.059
Valerie identified
you as her attacker.

28:05.126 --> 28:07.290
I'm sorry for her.

28:07.357 --> 28:09.191
I really am.

28:09.259 --> 28:13.795
But if the police believed her,
wouldn't I be under arrest?

28:13.863 --> 28:14.963
You stalked her.

28:15.031 --> 28:17.798
Did Cal coach
the girl,

28:17.866 --> 28:19.467
get her to
name Martin?

28:19.534 --> 28:21.802
I know how manipulative
he can be.

28:21.869 --> 28:24.304
She was barely
responsive.

28:24.372 --> 28:26.806
Well, if you see
her file,

28:26.874 --> 28:29.541
she spent half her life
on antidepressants.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.745
Here's how it really happened.
Valerie came on to me.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.681
Well, you should know that we're
getting a warrant to search your car.

28:36.748 --> 28:38.816
Now, if we find any evidence
that she was in it--

28:38.883 --> 28:41.852
you will. I gave her a lift home
one night from the library.

28:41.919 --> 28:44.821
Yeah, but see, the thing is,
she never made it home.

28:44.888 --> 28:46.322
You tried to
drown her 3 times.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.824
Then you dragged her into the woods
and tried to bury her.

28:48.892 --> 28:50.759
That never happened.

28:50.827 --> 28:53.228
I mean, she's obviously troubled.
Anyone can see that.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.696
That's why you picked her.

28:54.764 --> 28:57.398
She's troubled.
She's vulnerable.

28:57.466 --> 29:00.734
You prey on the weak,
right, Martin?

29:00.802 --> 29:03.704
Listen, all I was doing was showing
the girl some kindness.

29:03.771 --> 29:05.439
No. She's
the perfect victim.

29:05.506 --> 29:07.707
You like to traumatize her,
you break her,

29:07.775 --> 29:11.677
she begs to die,
and she's just your type.

29:11.745 --> 29:13.779
That's not true.

29:13.847 --> 29:15.280
I like strong women.

29:15.348 --> 29:18.049
Oh, like Helen,
you mean?

29:18.117 --> 29:21.785
She's a strong woman.
Tell me, how does that work,

29:21.853 --> 29:24.289
I mean, with you two?

29:24.356 --> 29:27.658
Do you play the woman
in that whole scenario, do you?

29:27.726 --> 29:29.793
I mean, who's the pitcher,
who's the catcher?

29:29.861 --> 29:31.796
Are you just
following orders?

29:31.864 --> 29:34.765
I mean, you do
what she says, is that it?

29:34.833 --> 29:36.533
Huh?

29:37.802 --> 29:40.236
I wouldn't worry,
though.

29:40.304 --> 29:41.804
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:41.872 --> 29:45.107
Did you think what was going
on between you two was real?

29:45.175 --> 29:46.742
Did you?

29:46.810 --> 29:49.044
Well, take it from me,
it's not.

29:49.112 --> 29:51.246
I've been there.

29:51.313 --> 29:54.016
No, she's had dozens.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.451
She gets bored,
she moves on.

29:55.519 --> 29:57.552
Like hell!

30:05.627 --> 30:08.228
I think we're done here,

30:08.296 --> 30:10.830
aren't we, Martin?

30:10.898 --> 30:12.565
If you say so.

30:19.464 --> 30:20.997
Martin's gone.

30:21.065 --> 30:22.299
You seen enough?

30:22.401 --> 30:24.334
He never admitted
to anything.

30:24.402 --> 30:26.070
What, did you
expect him to?

30:27.906 --> 30:32.344
Must be frightening,
falling for a monster.

30:32.412 --> 30:34.246
Ok, so you know.

30:34.314 --> 30:36.848
I figured that's why
you had a problem with him,

30:36.916 --> 30:42.084
the fact that
he and I were...well...

30:42.152 --> 30:44.183
Oh, and now
you know better.

30:44.251 --> 30:46.584
Well, you should.

30:48.417 --> 30:49.684
Right, come with me.

30:49.751 --> 30:51.185
Where are we going?

30:51.252 --> 30:52.919
Scene of the crime.

30:58.924 --> 31:04.027
He tortures and
kills young girls.

31:05.862 --> 31:11.200
Every girl he tortures or kills
is on your conscience, Mrs. Walker.

31:11.268 --> 31:15.239
I only let you in here because
Helen has been a friend to Martin.

31:15.307 --> 31:20.545
Nonsense. You feel guilty
'cause you got a killer for a son.

31:25.985 --> 31:30.055
How come there's no pictures
of your daughter anywhere?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.558
Did he kill her?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.328
Did he push her
in the pool?

31:36.396 --> 31:38.063
Cal.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.602
You can't face
the truth, can you?

31:43.670 --> 31:45.338
So you pretend
she doesn't exist,

31:45.405 --> 31:46.605
she never existed.

31:46.673 --> 31:48.675
I mean,
that's the game here.

31:48.743 --> 31:50.578
Right?

31:55.217 --> 32:00.288
Please. I put my trust
in Martin, my faith.

32:00.356 --> 32:03.292
I do care about him.

32:03.359 --> 32:05.527
Now I need to know.

32:26.747 --> 32:29.746
Well, that's one hell
of a rogue's gallery.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.314
World's greatest con men.

32:32.382 --> 32:33.814
Yeah, more like psychos.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.313
Yeah.

32:35.381 --> 32:36.813
To live with themselves,

32:36.879 --> 32:39.743
to deny their humanity,

32:39.811 --> 32:42.541
it's quite a trick.

32:43.876 --> 32:49.113
You know, if you can pull off
something like that,

32:49.181 --> 32:52.549
it's not really hard
to fool the rest of us.

32:54.685 --> 32:56.552
Your friend Loker
told me.

33:00.923 --> 33:02.256
Yeah.

33:02.324 --> 33:03.926
I should have seen it.

33:03.993 --> 33:07.262
Ah, kiddo. You probably
got him right.

33:07.329 --> 33:09.764
Me, too,
for that matter.

33:09.831 --> 33:11.264
What do you mean?

33:11.332 --> 33:13.666
Well, I am a crackpot.

33:13.733 --> 33:15.333
It's not all I am,

33:15.401 --> 33:19.269
but it's the truth
from time to time.

33:19.337 --> 33:22.772
And in a small
enough moment,

33:22.841 --> 33:26.779
even a cold-blooded
killer can be sincere,

33:26.847 --> 33:28.781
seem charming even.

33:28.849 --> 33:32.217
Now, how he got
that way, well,

33:32.285 --> 33:36.055
I don't think that a mystery
anybody can solve.

33:38.358 --> 33:40.292
It must be hard,
being somewhere 30 years

33:40.360 --> 33:42.894
and trying to make
sense of all this.

33:42.961 --> 33:47.292
What's hard is they confuse
growing old with growing stale.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.226
Mr. Hickson.

33:49.294 --> 33:50.727
I'm Colonel Gorman.

33:50.795 --> 33:54.294
You were looking for answers.
I've got some for you.

33:54.362 --> 33:59.932
Is there some place we can talk
privately without big brother?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.601
Ever heard the term
"shattered bone"?

34:02.669 --> 34:06.738
It's Air Force code for a bomber
that's hijacked or missing

34:06.805 --> 34:08.405
with a nuke on board.

34:08.473 --> 34:11.306
This is what your client
witnessed 2 weeks ago.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.743
That's Captain Eric Eeubauer,
decorated veteran.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.245
Cracked, and broke
radio contact.

34:16.313 --> 34:19.748
We shot him down
500 miles off the Carolina coast.

34:19.815 --> 34:23.250
This was not
a standard-issue aircraft

34:23.318 --> 34:25.752
but this does seem like
a standard issue lie.

34:25.820 --> 34:28.087
It might not have looked
like it on the ground,

34:28.154 --> 34:32.757
but there's a flash drive with cockpit
video in the file.

34:32.824 --> 34:34.757
So what do you
want us to do?

34:34.826 --> 34:37.659
You want us to go along
with some sort of coverup?

34:37.728 --> 34:39.696
I wouldn't call it that.

34:39.763 --> 34:44.773
What happened was a tragedy
for the pilot's family

34:44.841 --> 34:48.279
and an embarrassment
for our base.

34:48.347 --> 34:52.284
Are you nervous,
Colonel?

34:52.351 --> 34:54.286
This is
a sensitive case.

34:54.353 --> 34:57.253
I told my C.O. that given your
relationship with the FBI

34:57.288 --> 34:58.885
that we could trust you

34:58.953 --> 35:00.885
I wish the feeling
were reciprocal.

35:00.953 --> 35:03.220
The best lies are
covered with half-truths.

35:03.288 --> 35:05.722
I have no doubt that
you had a pilot who cracked,

35:05.790 --> 35:07.056
who was shot down--

35:07.124 --> 35:12.059
everything in that file
happened as described.

35:14.796 --> 35:18.597
You have no idea what was in the sky
that night, do you?

35:18.665 --> 35:21.233
That's the best answer you're going
to get out of us,

35:21.300 --> 35:23.067
Mr. Loker.

35:23.135 --> 35:25.736
If your client's smart,
he'll accept it.

35:25.804 --> 35:27.470
Smart?

35:28.806 --> 35:30.472
Or spineless.

35:36.310 --> 35:39.745
The Air Force is never going
to admit to a violation of U.S. air space,

35:39.813 --> 35:43.748
not by a Russian MIG
or by a UFO,

35:43.816 --> 35:45.416
you and I know that.

35:45.484 --> 35:49.986
But we also know that
what Mr. Hickson saw was not a B-1.

35:52.322 --> 35:56.257
So what there was a way
for the Air Force to cover its ass

35:56.325 --> 35:58.925
and also save
a teacher's job?

36:01.661 --> 36:03.128
Look, Martin, it's over.

36:03.196 --> 36:06.063
Let's not make
a thing out of this.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.132
Lightman's behind
this, isn't he?

36:08.199 --> 36:09.633
No, he isn't.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.434
I don't believe you.

36:13.703 --> 36:16.371
You've been different
since that day in class.

36:16.438 --> 36:19.072
He may have started
me thinking about us,

36:19.140 --> 36:22.442
what we're doing,
but that's all.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.649
You said you loved me.

36:26.717 --> 36:28.585
Yes, and I know
I shouldn't have.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.221
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.224
That I was
important to you.

36:32.292 --> 36:35.631
Your work
is important to me.

36:35.699 --> 36:37.303
We can still be friends,

36:37.370 --> 36:39.475
work together.

36:41.814 --> 36:43.481
We still have that.

36:44.817 --> 36:45.750
Let go of me!

36:47.319 --> 36:49.252
Hello. Dezekis.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.754
Dean Warren?

36:50.821 --> 36:52.656
Yes, Dean Warren,
one minute.

36:55.326 --> 36:57.193
Ok, Helen.

36:57.261 --> 37:00.430
Look, I understand.
Big age difference. I'm sorry.

37:13.277 --> 37:15.211
Well done, luv.

37:15.279 --> 37:17.213
All the right notes.

37:17.281 --> 37:18.615
What now?

37:18.682 --> 37:22.452
Well, with any luck,
he'll come after you with a vengeance.

37:45.101 --> 37:46.768
Oh, God.

37:54.977 --> 37:58.712
Don't worry, Professor Dezekis.
We have eyes on you.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.479
Cal?

38:05.546 --> 38:07.978
Helen.
You sound off.

38:08.046 --> 38:10.480
Nice read.
Very perceptive.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.983
Yeah, well, I can be
from time to time.

38:13.051 --> 38:15.385
Can we talk later?

38:15.453 --> 38:17.220
Yeah, it's a date.

38:23.060 --> 38:24.927
I told you, Lightman.

38:24.995 --> 38:28.230
I'm always 5 moves ahead.

38:39.541 --> 38:42.007
Welcome back, Lightman.

38:44.573 --> 38:48.738
You ready to die...
Again?

39:06.621 --> 39:09.856
You know if you
kill me, right...

39:09.924 --> 39:12.191
They'll do you
for murder.

39:13.961 --> 39:17.563
I mean, right now you could probably
plea bargain it down

39:17.631 --> 39:19.965
to kidnapping or forced labor
or something.

39:20.033 --> 39:21.400
You know what
you need, Lightman?

39:21.468 --> 39:23.336
You need a gun, but you don't
have one, do you?

39:23.403 --> 39:24.904
I've got you thinking,
though, don't I?

39:24.971 --> 39:26.973
I mean, it's funny.

39:27.041 --> 39:29.975
A minute ago, you were
in full control.

39:30.043 --> 39:31.977
Now look at you.

39:32.045 --> 39:33.912
You know, after
I get done here,

39:33.980 --> 39:35.914
I'm gonna take care
of Helen.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.650
And I'm gonna bury you
side by side.

39:38.718 --> 39:40.419
Be romantic.

39:40.486 --> 39:42.487
There's a girl
buried around here?

39:42.555 --> 39:43.822
How many?

39:43.890 --> 39:45.724
This is boring,
Lightman. Keep digging.

39:47.493 --> 39:50.227
Oh, sorry.
I'm stalling.

39:53.497 --> 39:56.433
You do know I've
got a GPS tracker on the van.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.434
Have some dignity,
for God's sakes.

39:58.502 --> 40:00.737
Don't humiliate yourself.

40:03.074 --> 40:06.009
You do the bloody
digging. Go on.

40:06.077 --> 40:07.744
You do it.

40:13.016 --> 40:15.417
That just means
you'll die for real soon.

40:15.484 --> 40:16.951
Yeah, the shrink's gonna have a field
day with you.

40:17.019 --> 40:18.520
You know that,
don't you?

40:18.587 --> 40:21.522
I mean, what is it
with you animals?

40:21.590 --> 40:25.025
Did you push your
sister in the pool?

40:25.093 --> 40:27.528
No.

40:27.595 --> 40:29.429
She fell.

40:29.497 --> 40:31.531
You didn't help her,
though, did you?

40:31.599 --> 40:33.533
You just watched
her drown.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.035
Yes.

40:35.103 --> 40:36.770
Why?

40:38.606 --> 40:41.041
I wanted her bike.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.046
Drop the gun! Drop it!

40:44.113 --> 40:46.782
Drop the gun!
Drop it!

40:50.054 --> 40:51.554
It's like you said.

40:51.622 --> 40:54.057
They only have me
on unlawful detainment at worst.

40:56.026 --> 40:57.427
She's buried
somewhere here.

40:57.494 --> 40:58.895
She's probably just
before the road.

40:58.963 --> 41:00.664
There aren't any
bodies, Lightman.

41:00.731 --> 41:02.666
When they rolled up,
you looked.

41:02.733 --> 41:04.267
You looked
towards the trees.

41:04.335 --> 41:06.002
That's where your
secret is, right?

41:06.070 --> 41:07.504
Sweep the area!

41:07.571 --> 41:10.006
Right? You owe me
200 bucks!

41:10.074 --> 41:11.741
You bastard!

41:27.086 --> 41:29.389
In vino veritas?

41:29.456 --> 41:32.024
That's the only truth
I'm gonna get apparently.

41:32.092 --> 41:35.527
I just perpetrated a lie
on an entire school.

41:35.595 --> 41:38.028
Well, I thought the F-88 was
a good compromise.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.963
I mean, it could
have been what he saw.

41:40.031 --> 41:43.766
Yeah...but it wasn't.

41:45.535 --> 41:47.136
You saved a man's career.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.104
That's no small feat.

41:52.008 --> 41:54.276
What do you think
that is?

41:58.881 --> 42:02.219
I don't think that's
a mystery anyone can solve.

42:03.556 --> 42:04.725
Hey.

42:07.565 --> 42:11.668
So they dug up
4 bodies.

42:14.004 --> 42:16.738
I didn't see it, Cal.
I--

42:18.073 --> 42:21.007
I mean, not
at first anyway.

42:21.075 --> 42:22.908
I could have
saved you some grief.

42:22.976 --> 42:25.009
That's OK.

42:25.077 --> 42:27.245
Take it out
of your wages.

42:29.081 --> 42:31.946
You thought I was
obsessing on Helen, right?

42:32.014 --> 42:34.948
It's not beyond
the realm of possibility.

42:35.016 --> 42:37.516
You loved her,
didn't you?

42:37.584 --> 42:39.747
We had our moments.

42:43.453 --> 42:47.760
Oh, it's not like
she's Helen of Troy or anything.

42:52.094 --> 42:54.261
Fancy a quick bite?

42:55.530 --> 42:59.195
Thanks.
I've got work.

43:00.530 --> 43:02.462
Ok. Another time
then.

43:02.529 --> 43:05.330
Yeah. Another time.

43:05.398 --> 43:07.697
I'm glad you're OK.

43:09.030 --> 43:10.462
Night, then.

43:10.530 --> 43:12.196
Night.
