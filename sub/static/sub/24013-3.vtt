00:52.177 --> 00:53.762
It's that time again, y'all.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.098
Two rivals rapping the only way
Trolls know how.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.768
It's a compliment battle!

01:05.440 --> 01:07.025
- Oh!
- That's right.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.359
Nobody's like you, baby.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.278
Ha.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.911
Oh, yes, she did!

01:28.338 --> 01:31.007
Stick that in your self-esteem
and boost it!

01:31.090 --> 01:34.427
Whoo-hoo! That was tight! Very tight!

01:34.511 --> 01:36.805
And now our reigning champ,

01:36.888 --> 01:39.641
with 49 straight victories,

01:39.724 --> 01:40.850
Master Controll.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.186
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

01:43.269 --> 01:46.272
Flatter that Troll, Master C.
Flatter her real good.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.526
Yo, yo.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.659
Oh, man! That's what I'm talking about!

01:57.742 --> 01:59.119
Whoo-whoo!

02:07.627 --> 02:09.545
Uh-huh. Yo, yo.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.974
That's it, son. That's how it's done, bro!

02:23.935 --> 02:27.814
Well, looks like the winner
and still champion...

02:27.897 --> 02:29.732
is Master Controll.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.985
Hey, guys, don't forget

02:32.068 --> 02:34.404
to be back for another battle next week.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.115
What's the point?
Master Controll always wins.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.742
And the other person always loses!

02:39.826 --> 02:41.995
Ooh, good point, Cooper. Mm.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.832
Yo, Controll, my man,

02:45.915 --> 02:47.500
I'm losing my audience.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.713
How 'bout stepping down and giving
someone else a chance to win?

02:51.796 --> 02:54.674
I'm the compliment king, son.
I rule this Troll City.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.009
I'll never quit.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.886
By the way, you look pretty.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.307
The only Troll that can rap me
off this stage

03:02.390 --> 03:04.517
is too scared to even try.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.103
Tell Big Poppy I said hello.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.980
Ohhh!

03:09.063 --> 03:11.900
"Tell Big Poppy I said hello"?
He actually said that?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.526
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, this is bad.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.404
So bad!

03:16.487 --> 03:19.198
Go to your happy place, Poppy.
Come on, come on.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.121
Everything's gonna be okay!

03:25.204 --> 03:27.290
Ah, that's the stuff.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.501
What did Master Control
mean by "Big Poppy"?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.004
It was a name I used to go by,

03:33.087 --> 03:34.380
my rapping name.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.383
Back then, Master Controll and I
were rivals...

03:37.467 --> 03:38.635
Uh! Come on!

03:38.718 --> 03:41.054
Big Poppy!

03:47.310 --> 03:48.978
It was the best battle ever,

03:49.062 --> 03:52.440
until I got lost in the rhyming
and did the worst thing a Troll can do...

04:00.615 --> 04:02.533
I accidentally insulted him.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.746
Yo, dog, if you don't have somethin'
nice to throw down,

04:06.829 --> 04:08.373
don't throw down nothin' at all.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.666
-A'ight?
-Yeah!

04:09.749 --> 04:12.085
I was horrified by what I'd done.

04:12.168 --> 04:16.755
So I ran, never to see Master Controll
or the rap scene ever again.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.051
Whoa. That's so great!

04:20.134 --> 04:21.511
Great?

04:21.594 --> 04:25.598
You're a good enough rapper
to beat Master Controll and save my show!

04:25.682 --> 04:28.726
No, DJ. I vowed never to battle again.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.520
I can't risk insulting someone.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.316
Please, Poppy, this battle
is so important to me.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.610
It's the first show I ever DJ'd.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.612
Aww.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.447
I can't let it die now.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.412
Are you playing that music
to mess with my emotions?

04:47.495 --> 04:49.122
That depends. Is it working?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.044
Okay, okay! I won't battle...

04:55.128 --> 04:58.506
but I promise I'll find someone who can.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.135
Okay! We're auditioning to find

05:02.218 --> 05:03.803
a new rap champion.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.763
DJ, spin it!

05:23.698 --> 05:24.532
Next!

05:31.080 --> 05:33.166
- I'm not doing this.
- Next!

05:45.928 --> 05:46.929
Next!

05:47.722 --> 05:49.640
Mm, take that and that!

05:49.724 --> 05:52.643
Oh, and you know you can't handle this.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.729
Uh...

05:54.812 --> 05:57.565
Oh, oh, you meant the other kind
of "rap battle"?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.943
I am confused!

06:01.027 --> 06:02.111
Ow!

06:04.155 --> 06:07.075
An entire week of searching, and nothing.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.368
Face it, Poppy, you're the only one

06:09.452 --> 06:12.163
who has a shot to beat
Master Controll tonight.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.958
There's gotta be some Troll out there
who can improvise compliments in time.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.377
There once was a worm
named Dinkles,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.838
with eyes like a star when it twinkles.

06:20.922 --> 06:25.051
He was charming and then some
and so very handsome

06:25.134 --> 06:27.595
and sweet like a cupcake with sprinkles.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.639
Yay!

06:29.722 --> 06:31.265
Biggie? What are you doing?

06:31.349 --> 06:33.392
Oh, hello, Poppy, DJ.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.229
Just a game we play
where we make up poems.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.522
You do one, Mr. D.

06:37.605 --> 06:38.856
Meep.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.152
Well... bit vulgar for my taste,
but you get the idea.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.071
Hmm.

06:45.154 --> 06:48.699
Now, all you have to do is make up
a friendly poem about him.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.952
A friendly poem.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.123
Oh, my.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.334
This feels... so right.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.676
Better! Now more attitude!

07:06.759 --> 07:09.262
Hmm. I think I can do this. Aha!

07:14.767 --> 07:16.978
Dang, I think we've got a contender.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.439
Stay here. I gotta spread the word!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.112
Meep!

07:26.195 --> 07:28.656
No, Biggie, he's sensitive about his...

07:30.158 --> 07:31.701
...about his ears.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.619
But I like his ears.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.420
Happy!

07:42.503 --> 07:45.173
Uh, Poppy, you're sort of freaking me out.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.425
Listen to me, Biggie,

07:47.508 --> 07:49.260
if you don't watch everything
you say tonight,

07:49.343 --> 07:50.928
you could end up like me...

07:51.012 --> 07:55.600
haunted by the shame of hurting
another Troll till the day you die.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.604
Well, surely not until the day I--

07:59.687 --> 08:01.564
Till the day you die!

08:02.648 --> 08:05.818
So be very, very careful with your words.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.862
And have fun with it!

08:11.032 --> 08:13.910
Biggie! Biggie! Biggie! Biggie!

08:13.993 --> 08:15.828
Come on, Biggie, show up, show up.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.622
Poppy, this crowd is huge!

08:17.705 --> 08:21.167
If Biggie can defeat Controll,
I think my show will be saved.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.126
Wait.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.628
Where is Biggie?

08:23.711 --> 08:26.047
Uh, just running a few minutes late.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.965
But he'll be here, trust me.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.468
A'ight, I'll see you inside!

08:30.551 --> 08:32.886
Please, Biggie, wherever you are,

08:32.970 --> 08:35.014
I need you to show up right now.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.974
Oh, snail mail.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.395
Sorry to back out
on the rap battle, Poppy.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.023
- But you really freaked me out today.
- Meep.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.776
And Mr. Dinkles thinks
you have emotional demons to face.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.241
You need to forgive yourself.

08:55.034 --> 08:59.580
Biggie! Biggie!
Biggie! Biggie! Biggie...

09:02.625 --> 09:06.003
Biggie! Biggie! Biggie! Biggie!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.505
Hold up! Hold up!

09:07.588 --> 09:09.006
I know y'all are restless,

09:09.090 --> 09:11.801
but I promise Biggie'll be here
right quick.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.052
No, he won't.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.473
'Cause I'm battling in his place!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.226
Ohhh!

09:25.481 --> 09:27.733
Big Poppy? You hung up your mic.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.235
Did I?

09:31.821 --> 09:34.240
Prepare to be uplifted, homey.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.366
Give me a beat.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.043
-You're so sweet!
-Chivalry's not dead!

09:46.127 --> 09:47.837
Uh-huh.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.145
-Whoa!
-Oh-ho-ho!

10:04.228 --> 10:05.062
Yeah.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.157
Ohhh!

11:27.186 --> 11:29.939
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

11:30.022 --> 11:33.067
It's so thoughtful.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.363
Big Poppy's back, y'all!

11:39.657 --> 11:40.866
Whoo-hoo!

11:43.411 --> 11:44.703
Crazy!

11:51.710 --> 11:54.171
Gotta say, there's nothing more relaxing

11:54.255 --> 11:57.007
than assembling a 40,000-piece
jigsaw puzzle

11:57.091 --> 11:58.968
in the quiet of your own home.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.554
Gary, we're under attack!

12:11.105 --> 12:12.690
Sky Toronto?

12:13.274 --> 12:14.942
Hey! Who do you think you are?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.444
Sky Toronto.

12:16.527 --> 12:21.782
My Funtime Factory supplies every party,
soiree, and shindig in Troll Village.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.284
My card.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.787
Sky Toronto. There's no funny business
in my fun business.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.583
Yeah, I know who you are.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.418
I want to know what you're doing.

12:32.501 --> 12:35.087
Came out to the country for some R&R&D:

12:35.171 --> 12:37.214
rest, research, and development.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.009
We think these paint poppers
will be the next glitter.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.512
Well, can you not do that
in my very private, very quiet,

12:43.596 --> 12:45.264
intentionally secluded area?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.766
Apologies, didn't realize
I was in your yard.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.185
I'll move...

12:49.268 --> 12:50.686
to my yard.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.398
Got all of that one.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.400
Wait, what do you mean "your yard"?

12:56.484 --> 12:59.320
This is my new vacation pod.
Still under construction.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.613
Back to work!

13:02.448 --> 13:07.161
It'll be incredibly loud,
but it will also take a long time.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.747
But you--well, I--but I--

13:09.830 --> 13:11.790
Hmm. Gibberish, how quaint.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.167
We done here, neighbor?

13:13.250 --> 13:17.421
Sky Jr. will be here soon,
and we need some quality time.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.634
Excellent.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.512
Welcome home, Sky Jr.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.181
For your trouble.

13:29.517 --> 13:34.855
I now declare this new sapling
an official part of Troll Village.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.901
Smile!

13:39.568 --> 13:42.863
Poppy, I've got a problem,
and as queen, you've got to fix it.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.365
It'll have to wait, Branch.

13:44.448 --> 13:47.993
My queen itinerary is packed,
given all of these tree sproutings lately.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.832
I now declare this sapling
an official part of Troll Village.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.960
Smile!

13:56.043 --> 13:57.503
But--but it's urgent.

13:57.586 --> 14:01.173
Sky Toronto is building a vacation pod
right next door to me.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.675
Good for him.

14:02.758 --> 14:07.012
I now declare this sapling
an official part of Troll Village.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.931
Smile!

14:09.014 --> 14:10.266
What? No, no, no.

14:10.349 --> 14:14.436
You're not listening.
He just invaded my part of the forest.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.773
There is no "your part."
The forest belongs to everyone.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.608
And Sky needs a place to get away.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.820
He has the most important,
hardest job in Troll Village.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.154
Oh, please.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.282
Why does everyone sweat that guy so much?

14:26.365 --> 14:29.451
His job is a piece of cake...
often literally.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.996
Mmm.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.831
It's chocolaty.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.333
But could it be... more chocolaty?

14:36.417 --> 14:37.543
-What?
-Great idea!

14:37.626 --> 14:38.586
He's a genius.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.631
Branch, just be a good neighbor to Sky
and let me focus.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.467
I now declare this sapling
an official part of Troll Village.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.097
-Um, I think you just--
-Branch!

14:50.180 --> 14:51.473
Smile!

14:51.557 --> 14:52.725
Ugh.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.060
Hmm...

15:00.107 --> 15:02.693
-Sky!
-Hold on. This is the best part.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.408
DJ Carefree's ninth mix in G-minor.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.118
Ah. A revelation.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.371
Sky, if we're gonna be neighbors,
we need to talk rules.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.623
Glad you brought that up.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.333
Please don't drop by unannounced.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.043
I moved here for the peace and quiet.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.169
Okay, good talk.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.337
I'll play you out.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.797
For your trouble.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.968
No, Sky, I'm gonna play you out.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.889
Maybe not with music,
but you're gonna move.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.060
These are actually really good.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.857
Ideal hop rate. Still got it, Toronto.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.317
Morning, neighbor.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.486
Just out fertilizing the lawn.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.321
Oooh!

15:48.030 --> 15:49.281
Ugh!

15:49.365 --> 15:51.033
It smells incredibly bad,

15:51.116 --> 15:53.702
but I also do it frequently.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.871
I see what we're doing.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.041
Just remember, when you poke the Sky...

15:59.124 --> 16:00.751
you bring the thunder.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.127
Yeah?

16:02.211 --> 16:04.797
Well, when you shake the Branch...

16:04.880 --> 16:06.590
you gotta "leaf."

16:07.549 --> 16:08.509
Sad.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.094
I know!

16:11.136 --> 16:12.596
Hey, neighbor.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.849
I thought you made some good points
about lawn care.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.601
I wanted to do my part.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.436
Well, this isn't grass seed.

16:19.520 --> 16:25.192
My mistake. Must've accidentally used
birdseed mixed with rage enhancers.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.277
Huh? Oh. Birds?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.331
Hmm.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.586
Found those in my yard.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.797
Thought you'd want them back, neighbor.

16:54.013 --> 16:58.058
"Neighbor, don't leave your hatch open
while out gathering firewood.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.310
You never know who will try to get in."

17:00.394 --> 17:02.521
Very clever, neighbor.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.650
Ahh!

17:14.782 --> 17:16.785
Gary, protect me!

17:19.038 --> 17:22.290
What has he done to you,
my sweet boy?

17:22.374 --> 17:24.251
Too far, Sky.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.435
Hey, Sky! I must've fallen asleep.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.440
Oh! Branch said to give you this.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.027
Sky Jr.?

17:50.110 --> 17:51.612
No!

17:51.695 --> 17:53.947
No! No!

17:59.912 --> 18:02.289
He only ever touched my neck.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.501
But he touched all our hearts.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.795
He is survived by three bow ties
and a cravat.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.258
Hello, Branch.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.011
Are we done here, neighbor?

18:16.095 --> 18:19.306
Yes, I'm leaving... leaving
Troll Village altogether, actually.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.600
In my search for peace, I only found war,

18:21.683 --> 18:23.894
so I'll seek solitude out there,

18:23.977 --> 18:26.396
in the forest, perhaps never to return.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.190
For your troubles.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.367
Ah, this is the life, Gary.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.371
No music, no construction, no Sky.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.707
Just you, me, and sweet silence.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.876
Huh?

18:49.086 --> 18:52.464
Branch, you better get out here
and fix this right now!

18:52.548 --> 18:55.050
Listen, I know that since Sky left,

18:55.134 --> 18:58.554
the factory isn't able to produce
as many party supplies.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.306
My kid's ten-and-a-half birthday
is tomorrow,

19:01.390 --> 19:04.434
and they only have cakes
for ten-and-three-eighths!

19:04.518 --> 19:07.729
And they have no streamers
for my Distant Cousins Day bash!

19:07.813 --> 19:10.691
And I'm just here 'cause I like shouting!

19:10.774 --> 19:12.776
Yeah!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.903
Uh...

19:14.987 --> 19:17.781
Branch, no one is managing
Sky's party shop.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.869
So listen, you're gonna bring Sky back
so he can run his factory.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.786
Or what?

19:22.870 --> 19:25.164
Or you have to run his factory.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.833
Oh, blow up balloons and make party hats?

19:27.916 --> 19:29.501
Pfft, in my sleep.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.172
All right, your new manager
is here to save the day.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.799
I understand production has slowed down.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.676
Yeah, it's a huge problem.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.469
I'm sure it is.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.139
For starters, we can't keep up
with wrapping paper demand.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.182
What should we do?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.893
Uh, make more. Next!

19:45.976 --> 19:47.644
Uh, which cake do you like better, boss?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.480
-Uh, the one on the right.
-Your right or cake right?

19:50.564 --> 19:51.857
Whatever. Next!

19:51.940 --> 19:53.066
Thoughts on our new bouncy balls?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.944
Make them bouncy and ball-shaped.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.696
It's literally that easy.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.158
Boss! We got a major dilemma
on the wrapping paper line.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.246
We've increased production,
but now we can't keep up!

20:06.330 --> 20:07.956
Oh. Uh, okay.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.958
I guess we need some more hands.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.294
Uh, you! I need you over here now.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.713
But who will man the frosting hose?

20:14.796 --> 20:16.506
If you can handle it, so can I.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.468
If you say so, boss.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.358
Whoa!

20:44.660 --> 20:45.786
Ah, frosting!

20:55.921 --> 20:59.174
You are no Sky Toronto.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.553
Sky!

21:03.637 --> 21:05.430
Hey, Sky.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.975
Jeez. Are you okay?

21:08.058 --> 21:12.312
In light of Sky Jr.'s passing, I've
stripped myself of all worldly comforts

21:12.396 --> 21:13.939
to power-grieve.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.441
Sky Jr. is dead? I don't accept it!

21:16.525 --> 21:18.694
I'm so mad!

21:18.777 --> 21:21.697
Please, let me tie him, one last time.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.491
I've hit rock bottom.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.411
And I've moved on.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.915
Look, Sky, I came here to--

21:31.999 --> 21:33.750
To ask me to come back, right?

21:34.418 --> 21:36.336
Wha--yeah, how did you--

21:36.420 --> 21:38.088
It's my business to know. Let me guess.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.675
You doubled the wrapping paper output,
took a worker off the frosting line,

21:41.758 --> 21:46.430
then tried to fix it yourself, which
gave you a new appreciation for what I do.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.558
What? But... what? I...

21:49.641 --> 21:51.560
There's that gibberish again.
You need to work on that.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.271
Well, I've done some soul-searching too.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.440
And I realize I encroached
on your privacy.

21:56.523 --> 21:59.943
As such, I promise,
whenever I use my vacation pod,

22:00.027 --> 22:02.029
I'll go easy on the noise.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.572
Plus, this offer.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.781
I hope you find it satisfactory.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.618
An official Sky Toronto apology.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.703
Thanks.

22:09.786 --> 22:14.958
And I'm not gonna write it down
or anything, but I'm sorry too.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.752
And I really mean it.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.753
Cheesy.

22:17.836 --> 22:18.962
I know.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.547
Ah, there you are, Skytina.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.218
Now, excuse me. I've got a factory to run.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.470
Get the chopper.

22:29.890 --> 22:30.974
Be well, Branch.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.100
You too, neighbor.

22:33.518 --> 22:37.773
Finally, the neighbor war is over.

22:37.856 --> 22:38.690
Huh?

22:40.317 --> 22:42.402
Sky!
