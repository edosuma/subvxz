00:03.170 --> 00:04.796
I didn't kill that man, Michael.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.757
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

I find it incumbent
that you see the inside of a prison cell.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.600
I'm looking for someone.
A guy named Lincoln Burrows.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.101
SUCRE: <i>Man killed
the Vice President's brother.</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:19.603
Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?

00:19.686 --> 00:20.938
Because he's my brother.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.231
I'm getting you out of here.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.650
- It's impossible.
- Not if you designed the place, it isn't.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.778
- You've seen the blueprints.
- Better than that.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.112
I've got them on me.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.448
- You find out who's trying to bury him.
- Nobody's trying to bury him.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.951
The evidence was cooked.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.369
There's a lawyer poking around.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.579
Anyone that's a threat is expendable.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.082
You come around these bleachers again,

00:40.165 --> 00:42.417
it's gonna be more than just words
we're exchanging.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.961
Someone found Fibonacci.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.130
Who was this someone
and where is Fibonacci?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.841
I give you that information,

01:09.820 --> 01:12.447
- What the hell happened?
- An accident.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.660
- Let me get him.
- Hold on. Come on.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.376
Get out.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.424
I thought you said you were going to have
a conversation with him.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.925
Yeah, I did.

Things escalated.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.197
Thanks, guys. I'll take it from here.

I said thank you. I'll take it from here.

Okay, let's take a look at you.

You're okay, you're okay.

02:15.927 --> 02:19.181
- What happened?
- Nothing.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.726
This isn't nothing, Michael.
I need you to tell me what happened.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.853
Don't make me lie to you.

Please.

- Yeah, no problem.
- Yes, sir.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.070
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.698
I think you better have IA
start an investigation.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.242
There's no need.
We know what happened.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.953
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to enlighten me.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.748
There was a pair of gardening shears
left on the floor of the shed.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.958
Evidently he stepped on them.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.753
- Blade went right through his boot, huh?
- Yeah.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.631
So, why wasn't the boot still on his foot?

02:53.340 --> 02:57.052
Like I said, Doc. We got it taken care of.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.684
You ever hear of Top Flight Charters?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.936
- Yeah.
- They operate flights from small airfields

03:48.019 --> 03:51.273
across the Midwest,
like the one 10 miles from here.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.109
They're run by a shell corporation
Abruzzi owns.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.778
We get him on board. There's going
to be a midnight flight waiting for us

03:56.862 --> 03:58.405
the night we get outside those walls.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.992
You're willing to risk the entire escape
on a guy you don't even know?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.703
Preparation can only take you so far.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.081
After that,
you gotta take a few leaps of faith.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.128
- Abruzzi's a huge leap of faith, Michael.
- I'm not talking about Abruzzi.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.338
There's someone else who holds the key
to this entire thing.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.216
With him, it either works, or it doesn't.

- About as well as a man can in a week.

- If we don't get him on board

in that cell.

- It just keeps going straight to voice mail.
- Maybe she has it turned off.

06:06.032 --> 06:10.036
- Any chance you know where she is?
- I know exactly where she is.

to the bottom of it, Lincoln would be dead.

- I thought maybe they'd gotten to you.
- Oh, yeah?

about my well-being all of a sudden?

- I don't.
- Finally, an honest answer.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.667
But maybe you can save Lincoln,

15:17.834 --> 15:22.004
and maybe you can bring down the guys
who killed your boyfriend in the process.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.507
If somebody killed you
and Crab could've done something

15:24.590 --> 15:27.635
to the guys who did it,
you think he would've?

15:27.802 --> 15:31.431
I'm not as strong as he was.
I can't take those people on.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.224
I'll take them on.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.603
All you have to do is come to my office
and tell me what you know.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.149
I'll type it up.
You can sign the affidavit and split.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.776
I'll take you to the airport myself.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.406
OFFICER: All right, ladies.
Come on, single file.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.799
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

16:09.719 --> 16:10.928
(IMITATING BEEPING)

16:27.820 --> 16:29.071
Bellick.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.033
Hey, what's up, Lincoln?

16:32.116 --> 16:34.869
I want some extra time outside
for the next couple of weeks.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.830
Paint fumes in Pl must be getting to you.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.082
Cell phones allowed in here?

16:42.627 --> 16:43.753
Who?

16:44.295 --> 16:47.632
Extra time outside, a couple of cigarettes.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.593
Half hour, one week. One cigarette.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.228
Know a con named Sucre?

17:10.655 --> 17:13.324
This is what I don't understand, John.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.992
Otto Fibonacci fingers you.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.329
He put you in prison for life.

17:19.121 --> 17:22.290
Yet you act like you don't even want
to find out where he is.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.292
That's not true, Philly.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.796
Maybe it's 'cause you don't think
you have anything to lose anymore,

17:26.878 --> 17:29.799
you know, you're already locked up.
You know, maybe you,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.843
maybe you like it here.
I mean, I don't know.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.306
But what I do know,
is that if Fibonacci testifies next month

17:37.557 --> 17:39.934
you and I are going to be neighbors,

17:40.017 --> 17:44.814
-and I am not going to let that happen.
- I don't think you would fit in here, Philly.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.820
Fancy suits, tie, shirts...

17:52.738 --> 17:56.659
I think you're right.
So let's cut to the chase.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.036
Did you break this kid?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.622
Did he tell you where Fibonacci is?

18:10.131 --> 18:13.342
- What is this?
- It's a little gift from me to you.

18:17.555 --> 18:20.474
- Are these his?
- Yeah, he won't crack.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.066
Well, perhaps you should consider using
a different methodology then, John.

18:29.525 --> 18:33.029
From what I gather,
there are far worse threats in prison

18:33.112 --> 18:34.864
other than bodily harm.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.284
What happened to the days
when you used to trust me, Philly?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.453
That I would get things done?

18:40.536 --> 18:44.540
Those were the days when you actually
did get things done, John.

18:50.755 --> 18:54.050
- Daddy!
- Daddy, did you hear the news?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.553
What? What... What news?

18:57.637 --> 19:00.723
We're going to stay with Uncle Philly
at the lake for a few weeks.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.309
Yeah. We're gonna have a good time.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.564
You're right, John. Maybe you're right.
I do trust you.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.985
Now, you're going to take care
of that thing, aren't you?

19:20.284 --> 19:24.455
How are those boneyard visits going
with that girlfriend of yours?

19:26.415 --> 19:28.542
I imagine pretty good, huh?

19:33.214 --> 19:34.590
You know,

19:34.674 --> 19:38.260
visitation rules stipulate that conjugals
are only for married couples.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.929
We're engaged.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.642
Besides, I got that coming to me
'cause I ain't caused no static in this place.

19:44.934 --> 19:48.479
Please, don't dead my conjugals.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.189
I won't.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.652
- Thank you.
- But in exchange

19:55.611 --> 19:58.572
you have to tell me
where that cell phone is.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.535
- Cell phone?
- Don't play stupid with me.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.329
I'm giving you a chance
to save your precious conjugal.

20:05.413 --> 20:09.417
You lie to me, they're gone,
and they're never coming back.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.130
Now, where's that cell phone?

20:43.325 --> 20:47.204
Turner, your transfer came in.
They want you in administration.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.304
He didn't talk.

21:12.438 --> 21:16.275
All I gotta say is,
I better get to make all the calls I want.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.197
Gonna be kind of hard.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.036
Soap?

21:28.579 --> 21:30.831
I lost my conjugals over soap?

21:31.207 --> 21:34.126
You may have lost your conjugals,
but I can do you one better.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.962
- I can get you to her.
- To Maricruz?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.714
- You can get me to Maricruz?
- That's right.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.217
Yeah, and how you gonna do that?

21:42.051 --> 21:44.136
We're breaking out of here.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.305
How?

21:47.014 --> 21:49.433
- Starts in our cell.
- In our cell?

21:52.394 --> 21:55.564
To tell you the truth, it's already started.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.652
Are you crazy?
You think I want to break out of here?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.695
Sixteen months from now,
I'm out the gate.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.988
I'm getting married, <i>papi,</i>

22:03.072 --> 22:05.282
and I'm sure as hell not doing it
with no posse on my ass.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.743
Man, I ought to beat you
six ways till Sunday.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.579
I lost my conjugals, pendejo,
and all because of your little bar of soap.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.290
I had to test you.
See if you could keep a secret.

22:13.374 --> 22:16.085
You want a secret?
I got a secret for you, Fish.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.172
You dig in my cell while I'm there,
and I'm gonna split your wig.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.715
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

22:29.431 --> 22:30.975
That went well.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.609
Why don't we start with
Lincoln's relationship with your boyfriend?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.735
Real simple.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.154
He owed my man $90,000,
and he wasn't getting it done.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.990
Then all of a sudden, it gets done.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.576
Crab walks in with $90,000
and a big ass smile on his face.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.785
Who paid him?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.997
- Not Lincoln. They paid his marker.
- Who's they?

22:54.790 --> 22:58.294
It's all right, Leticia.
I told you, you're safe here.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.923
Crab brought this guy home.
Never seen him before.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.093
<i>LETICIA: Crab did what he always did
when he was doing big business.</i>

23:06.176 --> 23:09.096
<i>He told me to take a walk,
so that's exactly what I did.</i>

23:09.179 --> 23:10.389
<i>There was something
about this guy, though.</i>

23:10.472 --> 23:13.100
He wasn't the kind of guy
Crab usually dealt with.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.268
What do you mean?

23:14.351 --> 23:16.896
Couldn't put my finger on it
till he went outside.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.148
<i>Then I knew. He had that look.</i>

23:19.315 --> 23:20.691
<i>- What look?
- You know.</i>

23:20.774 --> 23:23.986
<i>Like they own the place.
Like they're untouchable.</i>

23:24.570 --> 23:26.530
<i>Like they're government.</i>

23:26.614 --> 23:29.116
<i>So the government paid Lincoln's debt?</i>

23:30.451 --> 23:33.203
Did Crab say what they wanted in return?

23:34.955 --> 23:38.125
All right.
Just give me a moment to type this up.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.004
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna have a smoke.

23:42.087 --> 23:45.841
- This is only going to take me a minute.
- So will the smoke.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.889
No redness or swelling,
so there's no sign of infection.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.351
I'm going to keep you on antibiotics
for the next 10 days.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.186
You should be good.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.898
Michael, you understand by law

24:00.981 --> 24:04.944
I'm obligated to file a report
if I feel there's been prisoner misconduct.

24:05.027 --> 24:09.490
There's no way this injury happened
by stepping on a blade in a garden shed.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.117
If you file a report,
things could get a lot worse for me.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.871
- They're not already?
- Not compared to what they could be.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.000
- I've made some enemies.
- Yeah.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.795
You scared?

24:25.297 --> 24:29.885
Men. Okay, here's what I think.
I think you are scared.

24:31.178 --> 24:35.432
And you wouldn't be human
if you weren't scared in a place like this.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.228
When I was young,
I couldn't sleep at night

24:39.311 --> 24:42.564
because I thought
there was a monster in the closet.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.192
But my brother told me there wasn't
anything in the closet but fear,

24:45.275 --> 24:48.529
and fear wasn't real.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.617
He said it wasn't made of anything.
It was just. . .air.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.577
Not even that.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.414
He said you just have to face it.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.418
You just have to open that door,
and the monster would disappear.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.462
- Your brother sounds like a smart man.
- He is.

25:07.131 --> 25:11.427
In here, though,
you face your fear, you open that door,

25:12.469 --> 25:15.305
and there's a hundred more doors
behind it.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.643
And the monsters
that are hiding behind them

25:19.727 --> 25:21.603
are all real.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.857
If you want,
I could recommend you be sent to Ad Seg.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.651
With the rape victims and the snitches.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.029
It would keep you safe.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.822
Thanks.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.617
But I think I'd like to face
the monsters on my own.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.750
- Have a good smoke?
- I don't smoke.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.840
Didn't mean to startle you.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.593
Special Agent Kellerman, Secret Service.

25:53.969 --> 25:58.140
We've been informed that you obtained
a copy of the surveillance tape

25:58.223 --> 26:00.851
entered as evidence
in the Lincoln Burrows trial.

26:00.934 --> 26:04.021
- Is there a problem with that?
- We're just following up.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.314
Has there been some amendment

26:05.397 --> 26:08.984
to the Freedom of Information Act
that I'm not aware of?

26:10.486 --> 26:14.031
You know, when a prisoner gets close
to the end of his time on death row

26:14.114 --> 26:15.949
-there's a lot of last minute...
- I'm sorry,

26:16.033 --> 26:18.160
I still don't understand
why this would be a problem

26:18.243 --> 26:20.287
-for the Secret Service.
- It's not.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.957
The prosecution made its case
far beyond any reasonable doubt

26:24.041 --> 26:26.752
and we know that we have the right man.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.130
That being said, if you come across

26:30.214 --> 26:33.842
anything that could shed some light
on his innocence,

26:33.926 --> 26:35.636
I'm offering my help.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.847
Sounds great.
I really appreciate you coming by.

26:43.185 --> 26:46.355
- Do you have a card, Agent Kellerman?
- Of course.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.859
- Don't hesitate to call.
- Thanks.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.621
Leticia.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.564
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

27:30.440 --> 27:33.193
- Sebastian, I'm so sorry, I...
- Where are you?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.696
I'm sorry... This just isn't the time.
I'm sorry.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.739
This is the time. I'm at the reception hall.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.325
<i>The coordinator's here, the vendors.</i>

27:41.201 --> 27:44.496
Look, I'm just...
I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.601
I say we take his whole foot.

28:05.726 --> 28:09.479
We could cut off all his limbs,
he still wouldn't talk.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.775
Pain is not the answer here.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.446
Maybe The Beatles were right after all.

28:18.739 --> 28:21.325
Maybe all you need is love.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.454
What are you doing?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.540
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm rolling it up.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.875
You can't do this.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.085
I'm done playing
your reindeer games, Fish.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.339
I'm going to transfer to a nice quiet cell
with a normal cellie.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.925
One that doesn't screw my entire life up.

28:38.008 --> 28:41.970
Look, I'm sorry about your conjugals,

28:42.054 --> 28:43.805
but if you go now...

28:46.433 --> 28:49.478
- Don't do this, please.
- Listen to me, Fish.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.315
I got 16 months.
I got a fiancée to think about.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.150
I get caught with a hole in my wall,

28:55.234 --> 28:58.695
I don't get to see the real world
for another five years.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.405
Let's go, Sucre.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.575
- I can't do that.
- There's always a solution.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.453
- We can work it out.
- Sorry, Fish.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.171
Can I ask you something?

29:17.089 --> 29:19.383
Why have you denied
any family or loved ones

29:19.466 --> 29:21.260
to be there for you in the end?

29:21.343 --> 29:23.637
Why would I let them watch me die?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.682
I've caused them enough pain.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.601
Maybe it's not about them
watching you die.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.064
Maybe it's about me watching them live.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.275
- That the final torture?
- No.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.237
It's about how you want to leave
this world.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.240
What's the last image
you want to take with you?

29:43.323 --> 29:44.700
A stranger?

29:59.840 --> 30:02.718
Got an issue with our little friend
over there?

30:02.801 --> 30:05.429
I don't gotta come to you.
You don't give the green light.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.307
Everything in here runs through me,
you know that.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.935
Maytag's in the ground
because of that piece of detritus.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.895
So now you want him.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.357
Every day for the rest of his bid.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.028
Seems you and I
have something in common, then.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.914
ABRUZZI: Easy now, Fish.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.625
Don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

30:35.709 --> 30:39.212
It's time we came to an arrangement,
don't you think?

30:52.392 --> 30:55.020
You know, I was thinking
I was gonna gut you

30:55.103 --> 30:58.023
bow to stern,
as soon as I laid eyes on you.

30:58.106 --> 31:02.319
But, alackaday, you look so pretty
when you're scared, don't you?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.157
Maybe we ought to get the love
out of the way

31:07.240 --> 31:11.078
before we move onto the hate.
What do you say to that, pretty?

31:11.870 --> 31:12.871
Yeah.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.876
Yeah, maybe it's time I lit up that leather
once and for all, huh?

31:22.672 --> 31:25.467
God, he talks too much.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.388
You and I need to have a conversation.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.818
What happened in there
was my way of saying

31:42.901 --> 31:46.655
I know I've been going about
this whole thing the wrong way.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.616
MAN: We've got a man down.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.159
I'm trying to make amends here!

31:51.243 --> 31:52.702
We need some help in here!

31:52.786 --> 31:53.954
Bygones be bygones.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.705
Need a doctor down here, quick!

31:55.789 --> 31:59.251
- You're a mercurial man, John.
- I prefer bold.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.671
Come on, just keep it moving, guys.
Come on.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.010
- Tell me what you need from me.
- A trade.

32:09.094 --> 32:12.597
You get me a plane
and I'll get you Fibonacci.

32:12.681 --> 32:16.268
- What do you need the plane for?
- I think you know.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.397
I help you, I'm in.
You know that, don't you?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.690
I do.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.527
I just gotta know the exact date and time.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.405
- I'll tell you soon enough.
- Soon enough ain't gonna out it.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.408
I need to be outside these walls
before Fibonacci testifies.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.909
You will be.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.328
He testifies in one month.

32:35.412 --> 32:38.081
Then you'll be out in plenty of time.

32:38.165 --> 32:41.460
If not, you're a corpse.

32:44.004 --> 32:47.883
So you better cut the crap,
tell me the exact date and time,

32:47.966 --> 32:49.843
so I can start making the arrangements.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.887
I don't know
if I can trust you with that information yet.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.556
- Why not?
- Like I said, John, you're a mercurial man.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.735
Lewis, take these off.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.780
- Sink, I can't do that.
- Come on, man, I'm in a cage.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.491
Ten minutes.

33:12.574 --> 33:13.742
Please.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.620
It's my kid.

33:30.509 --> 33:33.220
So, here we are.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.387
(L.J. CHUCKLING)

33:34.471 --> 33:35.597
Yeah.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.225
How've you been?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.102
You know. In trouble.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.396
How's your mom?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.568
- She's good.
- Hey,

33:49.945 --> 33:52.155
I've been talking to the chaplain,
and they'd like me to decide

33:52.239 --> 33:54.991
on who I should have at the...

33:58.203 --> 34:00.622
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

34:00.997 --> 34:04.417
when you get to the end
you start to realize

34:04.501 --> 34:08.338
what's important to you.
You know, who really matters to you.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.969
And, you know, that leaves you and Mike.

34:16.137 --> 34:19.641
The only blood I got left in this world.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.896
Yeah, I gotta say I'm not really following
what you're saying.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.063
Well,

34:29.317 --> 34:32.737
in the end,
the only thing that matters is love.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.326
Blood, family, you.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.552
Give me your hand.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.888
What are you doing?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.807
Give me your hand.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.727
Give me your hand.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.989
I want you to be there...

35:16.948 --> 35:19.868
I want you to be there the day before I die.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.290
So I can see you, so I can hold you.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.050
L.-

35:37.719 --> 35:40.055
I love you. I've always loved you.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.108
This whole thing,

35:55.904 --> 35:58.114
I don't know if I can take it.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.826
Me, either.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.788
I don't have a choice.

36:05.747 --> 36:06.956
You do.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.648
I am so sorry.

36:32.857 --> 36:36.986
I met with this woman today,
and she knew things about Lincoln's case.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.572
And then she just disappeared.
I think something happened to her.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.701
Look, I'm going to make this
real easy for you.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.831
Do you want to get married...or not?

36:51.751 --> 36:53.211
I don't know.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.463
Wonderful.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.552
Maybe we could postpone it.
Okay, I can't do this right now.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.054
My head's not in it.
It's supposed to be a celebration.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.850
If you're really telling me
you wanna postpone this thing,

37:07.559 --> 37:09.602
then I want to cancel it.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.984
Sebastian,

37:17.318 --> 37:18.695
I'm sorry.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.783
I'll come get my stuff tomorrow.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.108
BELLICK: Open on 40!

38:01.362 --> 38:04.866
Scofield. Found you a new cellie.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.368
As luck would have it,
I found him in Psych Ward.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.579
You were the only guy
with an empty tray, so...

38:09.662 --> 38:12.791
- Psych Ward?
- You got a problem with that?

38:13.333 --> 38:14.626
'Cause if you do,

38:14.709 --> 38:18.213
please feel free to drop it
in my suggestion box here.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.057
Haywire, get in here.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.104
Close it up on 40!

38:40.318 --> 38:43.488
Oh, and Scofield, just a heads up.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.407
Don't make eye contact with him.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.978
Lincoln, we have a problem.

39:15.436 --> 39:17.605
- I got a new cellmate.
- Who?

39:19.774 --> 39:20.900
That's a problem.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.111
We're just going to have to
bring him on board.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.154
You don't bring a guy like that on board.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.490
Then I'll work at night, when he's sleeping.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.576
10 feet, Scofield.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.294
- How far behind are we?
- Three days.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.630
Thought you said
the margin for error was zero days.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.715
I did.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.496
Nice out here.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.833
I got a buddy who's got a place
way back up in these woods.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.461
Come up here hunting
around this time of year.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.503
Man.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.217
Put her back in. Back in.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.141
Here. Come here.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.020
- Take her out there.
- She's nothing.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.106
Nobody would believe her
if she talked anyway.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.485
Hundred yards or so should do it.

40:47.570 --> 40:48.738
Do it.

40:49.656 --> 40:50.657
Go!

41:06.339 --> 41:07.715
I'm sorry.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.717
You gotta believe me.

41:11.719 --> 41:12.720
Damn it.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.807
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

41:22.146 --> 41:23.439
(GUN FIRING)

41:37.537 --> 41:38.746
Please.

41:41.749 --> 41:42.917
Please.

41:46.629 --> 41:47.839
Please.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.425
(GUN FIRING)

41:59.892 --> 42:01.728
Pick up the casings.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.945
What's your problem?

42:53.529 --> 42:58.493
I got a neuroanatomic lesion
affecting my reticular activating system.

42:58.785 --> 43:02.497
- What does that mean?
- It means I don't sleep.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.084
At all.
