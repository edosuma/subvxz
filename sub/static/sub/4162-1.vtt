WEBVTT

00:45.000 --> 00:47.791
I don't know who this new witness is.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.458
No one knows it, Mr. Batliwala,

00:49.541 --> 00:52.708
but legal expert, Karuna Singh has
a different question for the commissioner.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.041
Commissioner Wadia,

00:54.125 --> 00:57.375
why is the CBI not investigating
the Stanley D'Mello case?

00:57.458 --> 01:00.500
Since it's odd, the police
is investigating itself.

01:00.583 --> 01:03.500
Five years ago we lacked evidence, madam.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.333
Now this new witness

01:06.416 --> 01:10.291
pops out of nowhere just when

01:10.833 --> 01:14.375
Mr. Pandya enters politics!

01:18.208 --> 01:21.833
Are we saying this
on Indian national television

01:21.916 --> 01:24.916
that there's a system
that protects witnesses?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.541
You can't call it a system.
There's no infrastructure.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.833
However, we hide
the identity of key witnesses,

01:31.916 --> 01:33.583
but only until conviction.

01:33.666 --> 01:36.291
You mean conviction or acquittal?

01:37.791 --> 01:41.166
Because, the famous the accused

01:41.291 --> 01:45.083
the faster he goes free,
while the witnesses disappear.

01:45.166 --> 01:47.750
The point here is
if we want to change the system,

01:47.833 --> 01:50.875
our politicians must change
the way they think!

01:50.958 --> 01:51.875
Politicians!

01:51.958 --> 01:53.125
We don't make the law.

01:53.208 --> 01:56.500
Laws are made by the State.
We just enforce them, that's all.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.666
My Lord

02:17.291 --> 02:19.958
I had told you
where you'd find a plain sari.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.291
Didn't you find it?

02:28.375 --> 02:29.291
Child,

02:30.750 --> 02:32.500
I had to leave...

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
so that whatever happens here...

02:39.083 --> 02:41.208
does not destroy your life.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.000
My Lord

02:52.208 --> 02:55.791
The choice that I have made

02:55.875 --> 02:58.500
As I left home today

02:59.291 --> 03:02.041
My Lord

03:06.125 --> 03:09.625
The choice that I have made

03:09.750 --> 03:14.458
As I left home today

03:14.541 --> 03:17.791
Whatever I need
I will take it from You right now

03:17.916 --> 03:20.791
That is for God to say

03:25.750 --> 03:29.083
-Hey! She's burning something!
-That's Karan Kapoor!

03:29.166 --> 03:30.333
Karan Kapoor!

03:32.083 --> 03:34.833
My Lord

03:54.625 --> 03:57.125
O lord of mine, You are the light

03:57.208 --> 03:59.833
By which I see the path

03:59.958 --> 04:05.125
As I lay down
And say Your name in prayer

04:11.166 --> 04:13.875
I have lost myself

04:13.958 --> 04:16.625
In my love for You

04:16.708 --> 04:21.791
Let the world believe
That I have gone crazy

04:21.875 --> 04:27.458
As I lay down
And say Your name in prayer

04:43.250 --> 04:46.083
My Lord

04:55.583 --> 04:57.833
Kaboom!

04:57.916 --> 04:59.916
Kaboom!

05:00.000 --> 05:01.375
-Sir, take this.
-Kaboom!

05:01.458 --> 05:04.166
Get ready for the killer shot.

05:04.250 --> 05:08.083
Kaboom!

05:14.041 --> 05:15.041
Gopi.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.208
Gopi?

05:17.708 --> 05:18.875
What are you doing?

05:19.208 --> 05:20.416
It's a Line of Control.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.708
Imagine there are chairs
on the left and right!

05:23.791 --> 05:25.000
Cross at your peril!

05:25.083 --> 05:26.875
-Sir...
-From top to bottom...

05:26.958 --> 05:29.083
Should I call Ms. Ira?

05:34.208 --> 05:37.875
Don't cross the line, sir.
These guys are Ms. Ira's spies.

05:37.958 --> 05:39.625
She needs to know what's going on here.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.375
I'm coming in!

05:43.250 --> 05:45.416
Raju? What are you doing?

05:45.541 --> 05:46.875
I'm not allowed to talk to the enemy.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.833
What?

05:48.791 --> 05:52.125
Today is 20th December
and the weather is still hot.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.416
I hope you're keeping your cool

05:57.875 --> 06:01.541
In fact, happy Sunday
if you're relaxing at home

06:01.625 --> 06:04.791
or chilling in jail.

06:04.875 --> 06:10.083
And a special hello
if you're just chasing your tail.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.583
-My auto rickshaw is fine!
-That's great!

06:22.666 --> 06:25.125
-It is your mistake.
-Who's going to pay for my damage?

06:28.541 --> 06:30.458
He hasn't left the film, silly!

06:30.583 --> 06:32.416
-This is a new scooter.
-It's just a minor scratch.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.791
Replacing me means

06:37.875 --> 06:39.208
How will I travel to my workplace now?

06:39.291 --> 06:41.375
If that witch finds out I'm helping you

06:41.458 --> 06:44.750
I won't just be banned from the sets
I will lose my job, Gopi!

06:44.833 --> 06:46.166
Why should I give you 300 rupees?

06:48.541 --> 06:49.708
Who the hell are you to teach me?

06:49.833 --> 06:51.125
-Shh.
-But your job...

06:51.541 --> 06:54.208
-If you're done, let's go.
-What do you mean?

06:54.291 --> 06:56.458
-Madam said, "left, left, left."
-And you obeyed her.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.125
So this is your fault.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.208
You want to fight with me now?

07:02.291 --> 07:04.583
It's no joke. There's oil leaking.

07:04.666 --> 07:07.875
-Hey! You... Show some respect!
-Hey!

07:07.958 --> 07:10.833
-How about you do?
-What are you doing, man?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.166
What are you doing?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.833
-Return her helmet.
-Who are you? Don't touch me.

07:14.916 --> 07:15.750
Don't touch me.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.958
I told you to go! Oh, my God!

07:18.041 --> 07:20.291
-Rascal!
-Sir...

07:20.375 --> 07:21.541
You again!

07:22.166 --> 07:23.541
Hey...

07:23.625 --> 07:25.375
-Stop!
-Hey, stop!

07:26.750 --> 07:28.458
-Her cell phone!
-Stop!

07:28.666 --> 07:30.125
He took her cell phone.

07:31.041 --> 07:32.208
Hey, stop!

07:37.375 --> 07:39.500
-Stop!
-You will be cursed for life!

07:47.083 --> 07:49.541
-Why did you interfere?
-Everyone was simply standing there.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.666
Hey, madam! Madam, wait!

08:16.041 --> 08:20.625
I'm so excited for this special someone
for whom...

08:23.125 --> 08:26.291
That person is about to get
a chance to meet

08:26.375 --> 08:29.416
with our celebrity mystery interview.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.791
Yes, you guessed it.

08:37.875 --> 08:41.458
I'm talking about
our Lucky Lunchtime winner

08:41.541 --> 08:43.416
who'll be in the studio soon.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.791
Take a message, it's urgent.
Tell her it's about Karan Kapoor.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.791
She has your mobile number, right?

08:55.875 --> 08:58.958
Not that number,
the one I'm calling from.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.750
Hello? My lift!

10:47.083 --> 10:48.041
Hey.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.916
Bring sweetmeats for the boys.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.291
Yes, sir.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.666
Two weeks ago
Satya Rahi Party leader

11:01.750 --> 11:03.666
and former ACP, Kamlesh Pandya

11:03.750 --> 11:07.333
refused to apply for bail
entering judicial custody.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.375
Tomorrow Pandya
will head to Bombay High Court

11:11.458 --> 11:15.750
to defend a charge
that five years ago

11:15.833 --> 11:18.583
he let rogue police officer,
Stanley D'Mello escape the law.

11:18.666 --> 11:22.166
D'Mello, who was last seen
fitting this description in 2012

11:22.583 --> 11:25.541
was an undercover officer
and a master of disguise.

11:25.833 --> 11:30.750
Is it possible he's still alive
and protected by Pandya?

11:31.416 --> 11:32.833
Viewers may remember,

11:32.916 --> 11:36.625
D'Mello disappeared
after carrying out 21 encounters.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.541
Encounters in which
he killed Don Arun Naik,

11:39.625 --> 11:43.208
his entire gang,
and some of his family members too.

11:43.666 --> 11:45.750
Perhaps such violence is acceptable

11:45.833 --> 11:48.375
given the murder
of a police officer's wife.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.916
But revenge always hurts the innocent.

11:52.375 --> 11:56.208
D'Mello left his daughter,
Alice, in a Christian orphanage

11:56.291 --> 11:59.958
where she later died of typhoid fever.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.750
Nobody knows the kind of feud this was.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.666
Whatever lies behind the mystery
of D'Mello,

12:06.958 --> 12:10.125
the prosecution is confident
that a new witness

12:10.416 --> 12:13.625
will secure a high profile conviction.

12:13.958 --> 12:18.666
If so, Pandya's political ambitions
will surely end.

12:20.250 --> 12:24.250
Boss, what do I do?
Criminals work on Sundays too.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.625
We need the station opened.
How else will we serve the public?

12:30.333 --> 12:31.916
Fine, I'll hold.

12:34.625 --> 12:35.750
Dheere...

12:38.916 --> 12:42.083
Sir, repeating my name isn't helping.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.541
What are you doing?

12:43.625 --> 12:47.208
Landline. I've exhausted my monthly
cell phone allowance.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.125
I won't pay from my pocket.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.583
But, come on, my brother-in-law
is a good cop.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.916
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Chacha.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.083
I met with an accident on Turner Road
while riding the scooter.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.875
It's nothing major.
Just some oil is leaking.

13:25.958 --> 13:28.875
So I'll be a little late
to deliver the parcel.

13:29.625 --> 13:30.458
Parcel.

13:30.541 --> 13:33.583
Yeah, I'm at Joe's Garage,
off the Turner Road.

13:33.708 --> 13:36.708
If we have time, I can get it fixed here.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.625
Chacha?

13:39.708 --> 13:42.500
He had to go. He's not home.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.958
-Without his mobile?
-Maybe, he forgot it.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.041
And who are you?

13:48.958 --> 13:50.750
We go way back.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.500
Joe's Garage is off Turner Road, right?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.750
Yeah, it will just take 20 minutes or so.
I'll get it fixed.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.916
Yeah, fix the scooter first

14:00.291 --> 14:02.333
and then come here.
Chacha will be back by then.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.416
I'll just apologize to him
and offer him some money.

14:18.833 --> 14:19.958
Dhanendra.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.875
Your brother-in-law is here.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.666
We're illegal, according to the BMC.

14:28.916 --> 14:30.666
-What?
-That's hardly surprising.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.875
Most police stations
are gifted by builders.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.458
Who's this?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.458
Some brute took her phone
and assaulted me.

14:38.541 --> 14:41.666
It was the other way around.
He got my phone stolen!

14:45.583 --> 14:46.416
What?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
Let me see your face.

14:53.791 --> 14:56.041
You selected today of all days
to pick a fight.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.375
-Is it swollen?
-Yes.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.458
Let me have a look.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.166
Got it!

15:00.375 --> 15:02.708
Great. At least we can make a report.

15:02.791 --> 15:03.750
Hey!

15:05.541 --> 15:07.041
I'm not filing a report.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.791
What do I do? She's sitting in my car.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.250
Pick up the phone.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.166
Do your work.

15:31.375 --> 15:35.083
Ms. Meghna Shergill?
It's about your overdue bill.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.333
Two days back you said you'd pay it.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.916
If you don't pay up,
we'll cancel your service.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.416
When will you pay?

15:54.625 --> 15:56.208
When my shop reopens.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.750
They'll be dressed to impress!

16:00.833 --> 16:03.000
Pintu, tell Papa to smarten up.

16:03.083 --> 16:05.375
His usual sloppy look won't do.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.750
Not at Zapata's. Where are you?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.291
Are you listening, Pintu?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.958
I'll give the message to Pintu, Aunt.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.583
Who's this on Pintu's--

16:17.625 --> 16:19.041
To keep the line free.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.708
Witness the FIR please.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.541
Fair skin?

16:34.208 --> 16:36.416
He wasn't short. More tall and broad.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.958
The color of the scooter is wrong.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.083
-How? Pink is pink.
-No, it was more...

16:44.791 --> 16:45.958
It was more like purple.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.166
-Is that so?
-Yes.

16:50.958 --> 16:52.166
How can I sign it?

16:53.250 --> 16:54.708
It's all wrong.

17:01.166 --> 17:05.458
The person you're trying to reach
is busy on another call.

17:05.541 --> 17:06.625
Hey, Pintu!

17:08.833 --> 17:12.250
-She calls you Pintu now, is it?
-Ugh, God, come on.

17:13.916 --> 17:14.916
You...

17:15.250 --> 17:16.833
Does this have a connection
with the dating app?

17:22.083 --> 17:24.208
And why isn't she wearing her shoes?

17:38.583 --> 17:40.125
Hello? Listen!

17:40.208 --> 17:43.791
I'm ready to pay for my phone,
but within reason, please.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.125
Hmm. You've changed your tune.

17:47.208 --> 17:51.708
Huh? I have an emergency in the office.
Who were you talking to?

17:52.125 --> 17:54.083
First, you tell me,
whose cell phone are you calling from?

17:54.166 --> 17:56.625
Well, uh, I met my neighbor.

17:57.166 --> 18:00.000
-Hello.
-Please tell me who you were talking to.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.875
Why don't you guess?

18:02.750 --> 18:04.000
Pintu is here.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.375
-How do I know? Archana?
-He came to meet me.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.041
No, it wasn't Archana.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.250
I have no clue. Uh, Gopi?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.875
Our plan in the afternoon is fixed, right?

18:12.958 --> 18:14.083
Who is Gopi?

18:14.583 --> 18:17.833
He's my boss. What do you want?
I'll lose my job.

18:17.916 --> 18:20.291
It wasn't your boss.
But it was a man.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.208
Is this a game?

18:22.541 --> 18:23.541
You're a strange girl.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.000
Do you ever think about the poor Uncle
who lives in Delhi?

18:26.875 --> 18:30.750
If there are any changes,
then let me know.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.666
-Did you speak to my father?
-Someone had to!

18:33.750 --> 18:36.666
You haven't picked up
his call in two weeks.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.916
-Do you think this is a joke?
-I want you to do this.

18:39.041 --> 18:41.875
Call Uncle now and tell him
you're fine. All right?

18:41.958 --> 18:43.791
Otherwise we're all done.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.458
And if you want to chat further,

18:45.541 --> 18:46.625
then pay your bill!

18:52.750 --> 18:54.666
What are you doing with my feet?

18:54.750 --> 18:55.875
I need to go!

18:56.416 --> 18:57.750
Then who'll drop me home?

18:58.083 --> 19:00.916
Let my brother-in-law trap this psycho.
Don't go it alone.

19:12.708 --> 19:13.833
He didn't sound creepy to me.

19:13.916 --> 19:16.625
-Mom, mind if I talk to my daughter?
-I'm not stopping you!

19:16.708 --> 19:18.833
Just tell me what
"it's complicated" means!

19:18.916 --> 19:22.416
-I will seriously unfriend you, Granny.
-There we are!

19:23.833 --> 19:25.250
Hello. Granny...

19:35.083 --> 19:36.708
I don't know. I'm out of credit maybe.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.666
Just give your number
to my brother-in-law.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.000
I'll sell my car and give you the money.
Okay?

20:21.791 --> 20:23.208
Note her address.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.250
Who hit you? Huh?

20:37.416 --> 20:38.416
Her boyfriend?

20:39.333 --> 20:42.125
Please don't tell this to Mom.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.166
Oh, God, you're such a blabbermouth.

20:59.875 --> 21:03.250
Hey, madam! Call the other hero
from my cell phone.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.333
What?

21:08.666 --> 21:09.583
Hey!

21:17.666 --> 21:18.958
That's illegal!

21:19.041 --> 21:21.708
Your entire police station is illegal!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.625
See, here's the girlfriend's number.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.416
Should we tell Pintu about this?

21:45.583 --> 21:46.541
Let it be.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.916
Oh, hi! This is Meghna's Granny,
from Delhi.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.750
Oh, uh. Hi, Granny, how are you?

22:03.833 --> 22:06.791
-Is she with you?
-No, Granny, she's not.

22:06.875 --> 22:10.583
Cool! Let's talk freely!
Her father has gone out.

22:10.666 --> 22:11.750
Uh...

22:11.833 --> 22:14.958
-Talk about what?
-Meghna! Who else?

22:15.041 --> 22:17.791
Poor thing's lost it
ever since her mother died.

22:17.875 --> 22:21.000
-Her mom died?
-Didn't she mention that?

22:22.125 --> 22:24.916
She got so bad that I thought
I'd have to move in.

22:25.208 --> 22:29.375
Now I'm going to trust you.
Or I will move in with you.

22:29.666 --> 22:30.583
Whoa.

22:30.791 --> 22:34.416
Now, I have a personal question,
so don't mind.

22:34.500 --> 22:38.666
No, uh, Granny,
I wouldn't know how to answer.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.083
Just tell the truth.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.375
-Did you get Meghna pregnant?
-Pregnant?

22:42.458 --> 22:46.083
She hasn't told you that either!
She's usually quite frank.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.208
No... uh...

22:49.291 --> 22:52.208
-I just left her.
-How could you just leave her?

22:52.291 --> 22:54.958
She's probably pregnant,
and you ditched her!

22:55.041 --> 22:57.041
-Granny, listen...
-No, you listen!

22:57.291 --> 23:03.083
Being a Dad takes more than
15 minutes of exercise.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.916
Whatever is wrong, fix it!

23:07.000 --> 23:10.166
Try chocolates!
Or take her out for ice cream!

23:10.500 --> 23:13.375
Papa asked me to call
as soon as you hand over the phone to me.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.500
That's fine, but how do I
delete this video?

23:15.916 --> 23:19.166
-Which video?
-The one you shot during the accident.

23:19.250 --> 23:22.916
Don't do that! I mean I'll do it.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.541
-My phone is temperamental.
-Just like its owner.

23:28.458 --> 23:31.208
Um, do you drink coffee?

23:31.291 --> 23:33.791
I have work to do,
there's no time to socialize.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.291
What if I come to you?

23:40.541 --> 23:42.500
I'll call you
after I'm done with my meeting.

23:45.375 --> 23:48.791
Look... Look, I don't have all day.

23:48.875 --> 23:49.875
Get yourself to Mahim.

23:49.958 --> 23:51.041
It's a ladies model.

23:53.208 --> 23:57.583
By Sitladevi temple,
next to a school, there's a PCO

23:57.875 --> 24:00.583
run by a kid
so no danger at all.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.666
-Where's the parcel?
-Parcel?

24:08.041 --> 24:09.583
Where is the parcel?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.208
Which parcel, Sherlock?

24:15.916 --> 24:17.708
Oh my days!

24:20.333 --> 24:21.500
Hey!

24:25.208 --> 24:28.916
Hey! Hey! Scooter! Oh, Pinky!

24:46.250 --> 24:47.916
-My money!
-My brother-in-law will pay!

24:57.333 --> 25:01.458
Yes, Mom. I'm still stuck in traffic.
Get a taxi to Zapata's!

25:01.958 --> 25:03.375
Mom, I'm driving!

25:13.125 --> 25:14.708
No, don't pull over.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.541
I have credit on my phone now.

25:27.791 --> 25:29.625
that some guy left you like this.

25:30.375 --> 25:31.375
Mohit called?

25:31.458 --> 25:33.583
Mohit? Now that bastard has a name?

25:37.250 --> 25:40.000
your granny thinks that I'm the father
of his baby, that you're carrying!

26:29.500 --> 26:33.625
I was taking down his number,
when he hit me from behind.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.958
Add this to the report.

26:39.333 --> 26:43.083
-And mention terror suspect in the report.
-First class, sir!

26:47.916 --> 26:50.125
-Something's wrong.
-So I heard.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.916
The trial is still on tomorrow.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.958
They're yet to find Chacha. Don't panic.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.500
There's an alert on
the guy on the scooter.

26:57.708 --> 27:00.916
Hmm. We need to finish this today.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.708
The city has changed.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.291
What if there's another witness?

27:08.208 --> 27:12.291
You never leave a trace,
that's why I called you back.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.416
Ramakanth!

27:31.083 --> 27:33.750
Why are you so worried?
Who do you think will testify against him?

27:39.166 --> 27:42.583
People, it's 1:30
and you know what that means!

27:42.666 --> 27:44.625
It's Lucky Lunchtime time!

27:44.708 --> 27:47.291
With me are two lucky winners.
Mr. Balvinder Bhalla

27:47.375 --> 27:50.541
-and his sweet nephew, Jaswinder.
-Jazz!

27:50.791 --> 27:52.000
Jazz?

27:52.083 --> 27:55.291
Jazz, you flew in from Gurudaspur
just to meet Karan Kapoor!

27:55.375 --> 27:56.416
Karan--

28:09.541 --> 28:11.416
-For your children.
-Sister...

28:15.041 --> 28:19.000
I am amazed how you
quickly answered the question which was,

28:19.083 --> 28:21.916
"What was Karan Kapoor's
first theatre role?"

28:23.041 --> 28:24.000
Sita!

28:24.083 --> 28:27.416
Sita. The Goddess, from the classic epic.

28:27.750 --> 28:31.583
He's been Karan Kapoor's
biggest fan since he was a kid.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.125
Karan was a bigger star back then.

28:34.208 --> 28:37.333
-I don't know what he does now.
-So, let's connect you!

28:41.916 --> 28:44.458
Jazz, be ready. Balvinder, be ready.

29:03.625 --> 29:08.833
Maybe he's not picking up
because he's shooting. Such a star!

29:08.916 --> 29:11.000
He doesn't even know we're here.

29:11.375 --> 29:16.083
Of course, he knows!
And his PR team is listening in.

29:16.958 --> 29:19.833
The lady at the reception
didn't even offer us water.

29:20.208 --> 29:23.166
-Have my coffee, sir.
-Forget it.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.500
Just tell them
there was an accident on set.

29:30.583 --> 29:31.791
That will buy us some time.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.416
What about the prize winners?

29:34.583 --> 29:37.041
There's a kid from Gurudaspur

29:37.166 --> 29:41.583
with his gym-body uncle.
He's staring me down right now.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.375
I'm a stuntman!

29:51.916 --> 29:55.166
I have a new peon.
I'll send my cell phone with him.

29:55.541 --> 29:56.500
-Okay?
-Yes.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.708
-Why would he answer your call?
-He will.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.333
So they gave you a peon?

30:05.958 --> 30:06.958
Huh? Yeah.

30:07.041 --> 30:10.541
Listen, at the end of their call,
please talk to Karan

30:10.625 --> 30:11.833
and keep my cell phone with you.

30:13.291 --> 30:14.166
I'll be there.

31:09.541 --> 31:10.875
What happened? Hello?

31:12.791 --> 31:14.833
I can't talk right now.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.750
How can we not talk, huh?

31:16.833 --> 31:20.000
I have a catastrophe happening
and I need your help.

31:20.416 --> 31:23.625
My catastrophe is bigger
than yours, get it?

31:25.208 --> 31:28.958
Go to Radio City in BKC.
Ask for RJ Archana, okay?

31:29.041 --> 31:31.416
She has to call Karan Kapoor
from my phone.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.291
Filmstar Karan Kapoor?

31:33.625 --> 31:36.291
Whose standee I was carting
around all morning.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.250
What do you do for him?

31:38.791 --> 31:39.708
PR.

31:39.791 --> 31:40.708
You love him?

31:41.583 --> 31:44.333
Public relations, media, interview, radio.

31:46.958 --> 31:49.916
Well, uh, she's waiting for you
in Bandra Kurla, okay?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.208
And what am I to you?

31:52.875 --> 31:54.791
My beloved peon, Prem?

32:00.083 --> 32:03.000
Listen! You can choose a name for yourself
if you want. Hello.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.125
Just help me.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.875
What trap are you luring me into?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.208
No trap, I swear.

32:09.208 --> 32:13.291
Two Punjabis won a prize to meet Karan.

32:14.208 --> 32:17.875
A hit man is following me.
He kills people and uses their phones.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.458
What crap is this?

32:22.625 --> 32:23.958
Tell me something.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.041
Did you report your phone stolen?

32:28.166 --> 32:30.458
Who reports a stolen phone, stupid?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.208
Where are you calling from?

32:32.291 --> 32:34.166
I'm at home and calling from my computer.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.083
And whose cell phone did you use
to call me before?

32:36.666 --> 32:38.208
I told you it was my neighbor's phone.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.708
What's all this?

32:39.791 --> 32:40.750
Boy or girl?

32:42.750 --> 32:43.833
Girl.

32:43.916 --> 32:46.291
-Hmm. We'll see.
-What do you mean?

32:46.375 --> 32:48.125
I'll dig out the number and call it.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.083
She just left!

32:50.166 --> 32:53.500
-Go, get her! I'm not sure I trust you.
-And what about my work?

32:53.583 --> 32:56.708
If I stay alive, we can discuss it.

32:56.791 --> 32:58.208
Listen to me. Hello?

33:39.083 --> 33:41.583
Where are you from?

33:42.458 --> 33:43.541
Join me for a drink!

33:49.583 --> 33:52.208
I need to change my shirt
and you need to find a gift for a girl.

34:02.958 --> 34:07.083
Something that says, um, you know,
"I'm sorry for today."

34:16.916 --> 34:18.166
Reclamation!

34:20.083 --> 34:21.958
Or shall we go wherever you're going?

34:24.208 --> 34:26.750
There's a quick update on Karan Kapoor.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.666
He's not missing.

34:28.750 --> 34:32.000
In fact, Mumbai, we're in touch
with his PR team.

34:32.083 --> 34:35.833
That accident on set
was not life-threatening.

34:35.916 --> 34:38.750
Thank you so much for all your calls.

34:38.833 --> 34:40.791
We're making every effort

34:41.083 --> 34:45.416
to connect Jazz and Balwinder
with Karan Kapoor.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.000
Sir, Ms. Ira.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.291
Ignore her.

35:00.583 --> 35:01.916
Hand him your phone, now.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.458
Sorry, my phone was on silent mode.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.333
What's this nonsense
about an accident on set?

35:18.958 --> 35:19.833
Which accident?

35:21.208 --> 35:22.833
What happened with the radio promo?

35:22.916 --> 35:24.166
I had to get away.

35:24.666 --> 35:27.000
The PR guy you imposed
on me is a pothead.

35:28.541 --> 35:31.750
Mr. Wannabe Woody Allen
who thinks he can direct.

35:31.833 --> 35:36.791
Listen, Karan, my campaign can't take
negative publicity, do you get it?

35:38.833 --> 35:40.125
Where are you?

35:40.625 --> 35:41.875
On a swan boat.

35:41.958 --> 35:43.083
National Park lake.

35:44.833 --> 35:46.708
-Are you alone?
-Raju's stuck to me.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.041
I am not asking about him.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.416
Send me a selfie

35:51.875 --> 35:53.125
from Swan lake.

35:53.666 --> 35:55.291
Don't you trust me?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.041
I'm not an idiot to trust you.

35:58.083 --> 36:02.125
Did you get the bottles of cologne
I sent you?

36:02.583 --> 36:06.875
My body's not in shape... anymore.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.750
So drink less.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.583
If you can't focus on our film,
at least focus on the election.

36:12.666 --> 36:14.083
I'm with you.

36:15.583 --> 36:18.750
I'm just trying to get my head together.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.083
Sir, don't!

36:26.541 --> 36:27.791
Pack up here!

36:28.041 --> 36:30.416
We're off to the lake to take a selfie!

36:50.250 --> 36:51.166
Where were you?

36:51.250 --> 36:52.791
-Sit!
-We'll talk later.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.833
-Why is your hat at that angle?
-I'm sitting.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.500
Mom, just chill.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.791
We get around four of them daily.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.750
But, sir, pink scooter.

37:16.833 --> 37:22.791
"Terror suspect, age 30,
pink scooter, checked shirt."

37:23.166 --> 37:25.000
Blah blah blah...

37:25.083 --> 37:28.333
"Last seen in Bandra.
CID Gujral."

37:38.791 --> 37:39.791
In our country

37:39.875 --> 37:42.583
when a witness retracts their testimony

37:42.708 --> 37:45.625
and becomes a hostile witness

37:45.958 --> 37:49.625
that witness is in contempt of court.

37:49.958 --> 37:53.750
In other words they risk
seven years of imprisonment.

37:53.833 --> 37:56.833
Now just think the amount of pressure

37:56.916 --> 37:59.583
and intimidation they must be under

37:59.666 --> 38:01.500
to take such a big risk.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.125
-Is this shop yours?
-Hmm.

38:03.458 --> 38:05.458
Do you know how to operate this?
I need a number.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.125
Will you pay me for this?

38:07.500 --> 38:08.833
Of course! Come out.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.541
Whose number do you want?

38:12.875 --> 38:13.916
His.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.291
-Karan Kapoor's?
-Yes.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.083
Write it on my hand.

38:23.166 --> 38:27.291
Yet the law threatens to punish them.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.291
So just think!
Is there any hope for justice?

38:31.375 --> 38:32.916
All I know is

38:33.000 --> 38:35.416
he is at his computer day and night.

39:02.708 --> 39:05.875
Now he can stop dating girls.

39:05.958 --> 39:07.375
Mom! It's not for me!

39:23.250 --> 39:24.416
Soon! Just...

39:24.500 --> 39:26.500
It needs some investment.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.958
Something that you like!

39:42.041 --> 39:42.916
Me?

39:52.750 --> 39:54.125
We have an exchange policy!

39:59.416 --> 40:00.416
Hey, Pintu!

40:00.541 --> 40:02.041
Hey, Frederico!

40:02.625 --> 40:04.875
Oh, I'm-- Don't worry!
I'm with him!

40:05.041 --> 40:06.125
Uh...

40:16.750 --> 40:17.791
Oh, uh...

40:17.875 --> 40:18.916
Guys, this is Meghna.

40:23.625 --> 40:24.458
Oh, Nandini!

40:28.875 --> 40:30.000
Did you run all the way here?

40:43.333 --> 40:46.291
Okay, so when the call comes you've
to tell him that you're my neighbor.

40:46.750 --> 40:47.958
Is she the same girl?

40:50.250 --> 40:52.208
-Mom, what are you...
-Who did this to you?

40:52.291 --> 40:53.125
Leave it!

41:07.083 --> 41:08.791
Yeah, Meghna's neighbor speaking.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.125
This guy's still after you?

41:11.833 --> 41:12.875
Uh...

41:13.250 --> 41:16.208
Oh, you gave her phone to her peon?

41:17.416 --> 41:19.166
That's why you're calling from a PCO?

41:20.166 --> 41:21.416
Yeah, I get it.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.333
Why? Why should I give her my phone?

41:26.750 --> 41:28.125
Oh, just till 8:30?

41:31.666 --> 41:33.333
What's this about 8:30?

41:33.416 --> 41:35.125
I'll tell you later.

41:35.208 --> 41:37.041
I have Karan Kapoor's number.
Note it down.

41:37.125 --> 41:38.833
Hold on. Did I ask you for that?

41:39.250 --> 41:40.083
No, right?

41:40.166 --> 41:41.875
I asked you to go to Radio City.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.041
And I decided to check out
your PCO story first.

41:45.791 --> 41:47.958
The little guy remembers you well.
Who's this?

41:48.041 --> 41:50.666
-The woman in the white sari.
-And what did you find?

41:50.750 --> 41:52.458
-Video.
-Hit delete then.

41:52.541 --> 41:54.291
What are you doing?
That's my private video!

41:54.375 --> 41:55.375
What's the big deal?

41:55.458 --> 41:57.083
We will have to rectify your mistake.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.041
Deleted!

41:58.125 --> 42:01.083
Try acting less smart
and you won't land in trouble.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.125
Happy Holi, bless the blouse-less!

42:07.583 --> 42:08.583
Karan!

42:08.666 --> 42:10.416
I need to take my paint off, please, baby!

42:10.500 --> 42:11.333
What's all this?

42:14.500 --> 42:16.583
-You're too young to watch this.
-Pervert!

42:17.083 --> 42:18.541
Let's click a sexy selfie.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.750
-Karan! Give me the shower curtain!
-Baby.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.958
-Jerk!
-Turn it off!

42:27.750 --> 42:29.041
Don't just turn it off. Delete it!

42:32.791 --> 42:35.875
Madam, we will delete it.
Just not today.

42:36.375 --> 42:38.583
Until our jobs are done,

42:38.875 --> 42:41.833
I'll be your beloved peon Prem.
Do you get it?

42:41.916 --> 42:43.166
Why are you doing all this?

42:44.083 --> 42:45.208
What have I done?

42:45.500 --> 42:48.416
You're going to look after me,
and I'm going to look after you. Okay?

42:55.708 --> 42:56.875
I just spoke to my brother-in-law.

42:57.916 --> 42:59.333
He's wanted for murder.

43:21.458 --> 43:22.458
Enough of this.

43:22.541 --> 43:24.041
Why are you leaving?

43:24.125 --> 43:27.541
Your son is thinking about something else.
There's no point lingering!

43:34.708 --> 43:36.625
At least pay for what you ordered!

43:36.708 --> 43:38.750
-Pintu, do something!
-No, no, no!

43:44.125 --> 43:45.500
You expect us to pay!

43:57.375 --> 43:59.875
find-a-boy
find-a-boy idiocity, okay?

44:33.416 --> 44:34.291
Give me some more.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.541
Have I opened a bank here? Huh?

44:36.625 --> 44:39.250
Sir, checked shirt! Checked shirt!

44:40.125 --> 44:42.291
Sir, catch him! Terrorist!

44:46.916 --> 44:49.541
Hey, you! Stop!

44:49.625 --> 44:51.250
Move it!

44:53.125 --> 44:54.583
You got him!

45:06.666 --> 45:07.916
What was the number?

45:11.291 --> 45:12.583
Why did you let him go?

45:12.666 --> 45:16.208
MH03 YY...

45:16.666 --> 45:19.291
-Faster, Pintu, they're getting away!
-No, let's go back!

45:19.375 --> 45:22.208
I had to pay the whole bill,
and I also left my glasses.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.041
Dad, you can buy new glasses.
My hat is irreplaceable.

45:25.125 --> 45:28.041
Oh, Hatman. Where's your priority, lad?

45:28.541 --> 45:31.041
-Hatman?
-Hasn't he told you?

45:31.125 --> 45:33.500
From the age of five
he's been a crime fighter

45:33.583 --> 45:34.875
wearing different headgear.

45:34.958 --> 45:38.083
-As a child he made me tell stories.
-Hatman.

45:38.166 --> 45:39.833
Hatman in the jungle...

45:39.916 --> 45:41.708
-saving animals from evil-doers.
-Mom!

45:42.541 --> 45:43.500
What?

45:43.583 --> 45:45.666
You were such a cute child, Pintu.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.666
-Now he'll go prematurely bald.
-Pintu.

45:47.750 --> 45:49.000
Just like me.

45:49.083 --> 45:51.041
From excessive hat wearing.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.125
-I need to get out of here!
-Okay!

45:52.208 --> 45:53.416
Does she want to escape now?

45:53.500 --> 45:55.250
No, I just need to meet my peon.

45:55.333 --> 45:59.583
You can't go till we find out
all about you.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
You love my son,
and that's why you keep harassing him.

46:03.083 --> 46:06.291
-What's this rubbish?
-She's more in love with Nandini.

46:06.375 --> 46:07.291
-Huh?
-What?

46:07.375 --> 46:08.291
I witnessed it.

46:21.333 --> 46:22.750
What's this peck?

46:23.666 --> 46:24.583
Not here.

46:24.666 --> 46:27.208
No, no, Nandini gave her a smacker!

46:27.291 --> 46:29.958
Aunty, Nandini is a lesbian, not me.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.291
What's a lesbian?

46:34.416 --> 46:35.708
Nothing, Mom, don't worry about it.

46:40.708 --> 46:42.583
Yeah, so listen! I mean, uh...

46:42.666 --> 46:46.333
You know Bhagirath, who brought
the Ganges from heaven.

46:47.791 --> 46:50.625
-Everyone knows except Godless men.
-Yeah, correct so...

46:50.708 --> 46:56.125
Bhagirath had two mothers.
He had no father.

46:56.541 --> 47:01.041
-That's right, no father.
-So Nandini is like one of his mothers!

47:04.750 --> 47:06.666
She has saved our son.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.625
Sing with me, child.

47:11.708 --> 47:13.625
-Huh? No, no.
-Sing along.

47:13.708 --> 47:17.458
O daughter of Bhagirath!

47:17.541 --> 47:21.458
O daughter of Bhagirath!

47:21.541 --> 47:25.541
You are like the moonbeams
For numerous sages

47:25.625 --> 47:29.708
Humans, serpents and gods pray to you

47:29.791 --> 47:33.708
Daughter of Jahnu

47:33.791 --> 47:37.041
O daughter of Bhagirath!

47:37.708 --> 47:40.708
O daughter of Bhagirath!

47:40.791 --> 47:41.875
It must be brother-in-law.

47:45.375 --> 47:46.416
Hey, Uncle!

47:47.958 --> 47:50.125
Hello, dear,
this is Meghna's granny.

47:50.208 --> 47:53.500
I didn't want to disturb you.
There's one way to be sure.

47:53.583 --> 47:55.458
Get her pregnancy test done.

47:58.708 --> 48:03.458
I won't tell Papa till we know
it's positive or negative. Okay?

48:03.750 --> 48:04.583
Okay.

48:04.666 --> 48:06.166
-Okay, bye!
-Bye bye.

48:06.625 --> 48:07.541
Who was it, Dad?

48:07.625 --> 48:09.958
You keep your eyes
on the road, Hatman.

48:10.291 --> 48:14.375
-And watch out for the bumps.
-Sing with me, child. Sing loudly.

48:18.875 --> 48:20.708
What's the fuss about the scooter?

48:20.791 --> 48:22.708
It belongs to some Prerna Mathur.

48:24.333 --> 48:25.208
Sing, child!

48:28.916 --> 48:31.875
-And who is Prerna Mathur?
-I'm looking into it.

48:32.375 --> 48:35.416
The scooter was sighted
in Mahim near a police station.

48:35.833 --> 48:37.041
Get over there.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.458
End this.

48:42.958 --> 48:44.583
Hey. Get me a glass of chilled water.

48:45.583 --> 48:46.541
Cold...

48:47.708 --> 48:49.333
You'll find it in the fridge.

48:53.750 --> 48:57.750
Daughter of Jahnu

48:57.833 --> 49:00.583
Chacha had connections all over the city.

49:00.916 --> 49:03.333
It may not be as easy as we think it is.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.416
There are two things about this city
that you need to keep in mind.

49:08.125 --> 49:12.000
Property prices per square foot
are highest in the world.

49:12.083 --> 49:15.208
Pintu, we should go to the temple.

49:20.083 --> 49:21.750
also are highest in the world.

49:22.083 --> 49:25.625
O daughter of Bhagirath!

49:26.083 --> 49:27.333
That's for sure.

49:30.166 --> 49:36.125
You are like the moonbeams
For numerous sages

50:17.041 --> 50:19.708
Borivali National Park?
What is he doing there?

50:19.791 --> 50:22.625
Nothing. He is just sad
and is thinking about you.

50:23.041 --> 50:24.333
I can't come.

50:24.416 --> 50:26.708
Listen! We're a team now!

50:26.791 --> 50:29.458
Don't make me threaten you!

50:30.583 --> 50:31.583
Okay, I'll come.

50:34.250 --> 50:35.250
Oh.

50:43.375 --> 50:44.625
What happened?

50:45.625 --> 50:47.416
We're such idiots.

50:47.833 --> 50:48.750
What?

50:51.041 --> 50:53.791
You're not my second choice, child.

50:53.875 --> 50:56.416
If only we'd known about you before

50:56.500 --> 50:57.833
none of this would have happened.

50:58.083 --> 50:59.833
Where in this rotten world

50:59.916 --> 51:05.041
is such a beautiful, pure
and pious girl to be found?

51:19.166 --> 51:20.458
What do you mean?

51:22.541 --> 51:24.125
with your mom in that state?

51:26.625 --> 51:28.458
Where do you want to go?
Do you want to go up?

51:28.541 --> 51:31.750
Place the altar! I'm ready!

51:32.000 --> 51:33.291
Really, Pintu, you're ready?

51:36.666 --> 51:40.125
If she wants to have a family with you,
marry her.

51:44.291 --> 51:47.875
Do you even care
if she doesn't like me?

51:52.208 --> 51:55.166
Do you know where your logic leads us?

51:56.666 --> 51:58.125
-First, we'd get married.
-Yeah.

51:58.208 --> 51:59.708
Then that child gets a Dad.

52:01.541 --> 52:03.791
Yes! That kid will need a father.

52:05.458 --> 52:06.916
I might be infertile.

52:15.958 --> 52:18.291
I just let you think that to escape.

52:24.541 --> 52:28.250
Sir, we found two phone numbers
on the police report.

52:28.583 --> 52:30.625
They're both being tapped now.

52:31.041 --> 52:33.416
There's a meeting in National Park

52:33.750 --> 52:35.833
-with Karan Kapoor.
-Who?

52:36.291 --> 52:38.458
Bollywood actor, Karan Kapoor.

52:38.916 --> 52:40.625
Who got the Bollywood involved?

52:40.833 --> 52:45.833
Guess what! Tell the prize winners
Karan is treating them to lunch.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.375
They must be hungry.

52:48.625 --> 52:49.666
I'm hungry too.

52:49.750 --> 52:52.291
Oh, yeah, you're included.
Eat with them.

52:52.375 --> 52:55.916
And keep the bill.
I'll pay you when I see you.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.416
I need to fix Karan's mood.

52:59.500 --> 53:04.750
-Okay, just don't keep us hanging.
-Of course. Wait there! Bye.

53:19.833 --> 53:20.833
Raju!

53:29.583 --> 53:30.708
Hop in the back.

53:31.083 --> 53:32.541
Sir, I'll drive.

53:34.125 --> 53:35.916
Please let him drive.

53:39.458 --> 53:40.291
Quickly now.

53:40.375 --> 53:41.541
Hey, listen.

53:42.083 --> 53:43.916
I'll wait here for your peon.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.416
No, no, no!

53:45.500 --> 53:46.375
Uh...

54:10.250 --> 54:11.500
Let's go.

54:11.833 --> 54:13.208
Open the barrier!

54:18.875 --> 54:21.583
Sorry, sir. Mr. Karan sprayed
too much perfume on me.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.125
Abhishek Sharma?

54:56.541 --> 54:57.625
Who's this?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.625
Inspector Gujral, CID.

55:01.541 --> 55:04.041
Is this about the guy who is wanted?

55:04.125 --> 55:08.041
Right, I read your crime report.

55:08.416 --> 55:11.083
Sir, my description is 100% accurate.

55:11.166 --> 55:12.583
I need to ask you something.

55:13.750 --> 55:17.083
Have you seen Meghna Shergill's peon?

55:17.166 --> 55:19.083
No, sir. Not as yet.

55:19.458 --> 55:22.166
Are you aware that
she trashed your report?

55:22.875 --> 55:23.875
What?

55:26.750 --> 55:28.458
I wasn't aware of that, sir.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.250
Give it to Abhishek.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.958
And make sure
he stays over there, okay?

55:44.041 --> 55:46.125
Didn't you turn celibate?

55:46.208 --> 55:49.541
Yeah, I tried to, three times.
Today was the fourth time I went there,

55:49.666 --> 55:51.583
but the Cosmos had different plans.

55:51.666 --> 55:54.958
What Cosmos, what plans?
What nonsense! Come on!

55:55.041 --> 55:58.125
Guess what I was doing
before your ego summoned me here.

55:59.666 --> 56:01.958
Tell me. What were you doing?

56:04.500 --> 56:06.458
I can't hear you.
Come into the swan.

56:06.541 --> 56:07.375
No one will come.

56:07.458 --> 56:09.208
-Come to me.
-No, no!

56:14.208 --> 56:15.208
Yeah...

56:15.625 --> 56:18.750
-I often think of those times...
-Yeah?

56:18.833 --> 56:22.041
So I thought of giving
you a small funeral.

56:23.416 --> 56:25.041
I'll organize a small funeral for you!

56:25.125 --> 56:26.000
Psst!

56:26.333 --> 56:27.375
Raju!

56:31.125 --> 56:32.708
It cleanses you.

56:37.291 --> 56:40.500
And sometimes eliminate them
which is why a funeral was required.

56:42.250 --> 56:44.458
Not a real funeral,
it was just your standee.

56:47.291 --> 56:49.500
I wore my mom's sari.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.833
Of course, in your honor

56:53.791 --> 56:55.333
But they found it too glam.

56:55.458 --> 56:58.000
So I'm rejecting both of you

57:06.666 --> 57:08.208
I'm not in love with you.

57:10.416 --> 57:12.500
And so, I was saying
goodbye to your standee

57:12.583 --> 57:15.166
when some slum kids chased me

57:15.250 --> 57:17.208
for burning a demigod!

57:19.333 --> 57:20.250
Sometimes in life...

57:23.833 --> 57:24.916
So I got in a rickshaw,

57:30.125 --> 57:33.583
you took of me at Holi in the shower
washing off color?

57:42.166 --> 57:43.041
Such as?

57:43.166 --> 57:45.125
Such as, I thought I looked good in it!

57:49.625 --> 57:50.833
What is it, Raju?

57:50.916 --> 57:53.958
Sir says the CID want your phone.

57:54.041 --> 57:54.916
CID?

57:55.000 --> 57:56.708
An inspector is on his way.

57:58.916 --> 58:00.875
-Tell him I'm coming!
-Sure.

58:02.416 --> 58:04.416
The guy who has my phone...

58:05.666 --> 58:07.791
Is he the one who called me?

58:07.875 --> 58:10.291
Yeah, I had to give him a job.

58:13.916 --> 58:15.083
Has he seen the clip?

58:20.000 --> 58:21.291
Meghu, why didn't you delete it?

58:21.375 --> 58:23.833
I was going to,
after your funeral!

58:24.583 --> 58:26.625
If CID finds the clip

58:27.000 --> 58:29.041
your career is over.

58:29.125 --> 58:31.875
Forget me!
You're just wearing paint!

58:31.958 --> 58:33.000
Where are these people?

58:33.708 --> 58:35.791
I parked them in a restaurant.

58:37.125 --> 58:38.083
Meghu...

58:41.916 --> 58:45.125
I've never seen such a crazy girl!
Why doesn't this move?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.291
That's quite a big bill,
it includes the hats too.

59:01.750 --> 59:02.833
Are you feeling better, baby?

59:03.291 --> 59:05.333
Ya! I suddenly got a spurt of energy!

59:05.958 --> 59:07.375
Is it from the lake breeze?

59:07.458 --> 59:08.458
Yeah, yeah!

59:11.291 --> 59:12.208
Really?

59:12.833 --> 59:15.208
Sorry, I was moody before.

59:18.208 --> 59:21.291
Listen, I'm off to meet
those prize winners now.

59:25.208 --> 59:26.583
Oh, you're coming!

59:28.500 --> 59:30.416
Missing you, a tad.

59:49.291 --> 59:52.083
You forgot about us
so we set out from Zapata's!

59:52.166 --> 59:53.666
How could we forget you?

59:53.750 --> 59:57.083
Are you near the park?
I'd love to meet you.

59:57.416 --> 59:58.791
Sorry, what's your name?

1:00:00.291 --> 1:00:01.291
Prem?

1:00:02.041 --> 1:00:03.958
Wow! Fit for a hero!

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:06.375
And you?

1:00:06.750 --> 1:00:09.416
I'm Abhishek.
Meghna is with Karan.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:12.125
Bring the prize winners to the gate.

1:00:12.208 --> 1:00:14.041
CID needs to check Meghna's phone.

1:00:14.875 --> 1:00:16.000
Did you say CID?

1:00:16.416 --> 1:00:20.500
Don't worry. They want her
call records and that video.

1:00:22.666 --> 1:00:23.708
Yes, the video.

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:25.958
I hope the video
is still there on the phone.

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:27.791
Are you this shameless?

1:00:30.250 --> 1:00:31.750
What's shame got to do with it?

1:00:31.833 --> 1:00:34.291
It's police procedure, that's all.

1:00:34.625 --> 1:00:37.833
I'll not talk to anyone but madam, okay?

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:42.583
What the hell is going on?

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.375
Bossy peon, man.

1:00:54.750 --> 1:00:56.166
Hey, hold on!

1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:57.375
Where are you going?

1:00:57.458 --> 1:00:59.625
Why is peon Prem so confused?

1:01:01.708 --> 1:01:02.916
You hurry home.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:03.875
What do you mean?

1:01:13.708 --> 1:01:15.125
Karan, we're reaching.

1:01:15.208 --> 1:01:18.375
No, no, no!
Meet us in Film City, not the park.

1:01:18.458 --> 1:01:19.666
CID are coming!

1:01:20.541 --> 1:01:21.958
Turn around!

1:01:22.833 --> 1:01:23.750
Go back!

1:01:23.833 --> 1:01:26.041
Fraud. I'm going to continue driving.

1:01:28.833 --> 1:01:32.291
Just remember, I've done what
you asked. Now it's your turn!

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:34.541
What do want from me?

1:01:34.875 --> 1:01:37.500
You don't want your scooter
from these guys?

1:01:37.583 --> 1:01:40.208
Scooter? Which scooter?

1:01:40.791 --> 1:01:41.916
Hey.

1:01:42.375 --> 1:01:44.625
-Is this for Karan Kapoor?
-Yes, he ordered us to do this.

1:01:44.708 --> 1:01:46.416
Stop honking! Shut it!

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:49.541
I've got this.

1:01:52.416 --> 1:01:54.041
Stop. Stop here.

1:02:04.708 --> 1:02:05.916
You want to meet Karan, don't you, Jazz?

1:02:06.041 --> 1:02:07.291
-Karan!
-Yeah.

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:09.666
Sir has to rush to set.

1:02:12.625 --> 1:02:13.666
Over here, ma'am.

1:02:18.208 --> 1:02:20.250
-Prerna, who?
-Mathur.

1:02:20.541 --> 1:02:22.000
I've never heard of her.

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:24.083
I need to meet your peon, right now.

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:25.458
You...

1:03:01.458 --> 1:03:03.291
He's here! Peon.

1:03:03.375 --> 1:03:04.875
-This is--
-Yes, he is my peon.

1:03:07.875 --> 1:03:10.958
-Fiancé?
-Go home! I asked you to leave.

1:03:11.291 --> 1:03:14.083
Meghna Ma'am? Your phone.

1:03:16.458 --> 1:03:19.208
I got my phone back,
from my peon.

1:03:21.458 --> 1:03:22.333
Why?

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:24.833
-The bill for lunch.
-Oh.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:26.958
Who gave you this?
The guy on the scooter?

1:03:28.583 --> 1:03:29.708
The guy on the scooter.

1:03:30.625 --> 1:03:32.375
-Where is he?
-I'm the peon.

1:03:32.541 --> 1:03:33.375
Huh?

1:03:33.458 --> 1:03:34.958
Thank you, sir, she has her phone.

1:03:35.041 --> 1:03:37.083
I'll ask Mrs. Angre to get you promoted.

1:03:38.458 --> 1:03:39.333
Mr. Karan.

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:48.208
There's a hitman after me.
He kills people and uses their phones.

1:03:49.916 --> 1:03:50.833
Let's go, Meghu.

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:56.958
I need to tell Ma'am something else.
What if I get whacked?

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:58.291
What else?

1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.041
Unblock the road!

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.250
You come with us.

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:05.333
Meghu, let's go!

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:08.833
-One minute! This is evidence.
-Hey!

1:04:09.708 --> 1:04:11.500
Give me something.

1:04:11.583 --> 1:04:13.291
-Take my card.
-Give it.

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:42.875
Hey!

1:04:43.416 --> 1:04:45.458
-That was a superb stunt!
-Get out!

1:04:45.750 --> 1:04:46.583
Out I said!

1:04:47.416 --> 1:04:48.250
Step aside, Dummy!

1:04:48.333 --> 1:04:50.083
What did you call my nephew?

1:04:50.166 --> 1:04:51.041
Get out!

1:04:51.125 --> 1:04:52.666
-No, brother, don't!
-Get out!

1:04:54.375 --> 1:04:56.083
Hey! What did you say?

1:04:56.458 --> 1:04:58.250
Hands up! Hands up!

1:04:58.333 --> 1:04:59.250
Who are you freaks?

1:04:59.666 --> 1:05:02.041
The wife you banged was
like a car to me, sir.

1:05:02.125 --> 1:05:02.958
Who are they?

1:05:03.083 --> 1:05:04.458
-Where's the camera?
-They're prize winners!

1:05:04.541 --> 1:05:07.500
Prize winners who won a stupid scooter.

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:09.375
They're just fans. Case closed.

1:05:09.458 --> 1:05:11.041
-What are you doing?
-Sir, one minute!

1:05:11.125 --> 1:05:14.000
My peon here was simply delivering it.

1:05:14.083 --> 1:05:15.666
You just told us he's your peon.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:19.375
There's a new peon for a new day.
That's the film industry!

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:21.833
How long have these delivery guys
been working for you?

1:05:21.916 --> 1:05:23.541
-One month!
-Shut up.

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:26.875
-I'm talking to her. Quiet!
-Correct, sir. It's been a month.

1:05:27.250 --> 1:05:30.750
-Sharma! Lock him in the jeep.
-Huh, me?

1:05:33.291 --> 1:05:35.291
You might be helping the wrong guy!

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:44.375
Sir, sir, my phone. I will vouch for him.

1:05:45.333 --> 1:05:46.416
-Really?
-Yes.

1:05:46.958 --> 1:05:48.875
Then you'd have to come along.

1:05:49.166 --> 1:05:51.875
-Sharma! Take her into custody.
-What?

1:05:51.958 --> 1:05:54.333
-How am I involved?
-Move it, Miss.

1:05:54.416 --> 1:05:55.833
Give me my phone, please.

1:05:58.916 --> 1:06:00.083
What's got into you?

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.833
I'm in love with you, you idiot!

1:06:02.916 --> 1:06:04.166
Is that your fiancé?

1:06:04.708 --> 1:06:07.791
You can lock her up, and I'll get her out!

1:06:10.208 --> 1:06:13.208
-You don't know me!
-Of course, I do.

1:06:13.291 --> 1:06:15.791
I wish I could be reborn
with your face.

1:06:16.125 --> 1:06:18.750
What's your badge number?
Which station are you from?

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:20.375
Here's my badge.

1:06:20.458 --> 1:06:22.208
-Please, sir, let's move.
-Back away.

1:06:22.291 --> 1:06:23.791
Hey, Raju! Give me my phone!

1:06:24.625 --> 1:06:25.958
I'm going.

1:06:26.041 --> 1:06:28.000
-You'll be hearing from me!
-Step away!

1:06:28.208 --> 1:06:29.958
Call the Commissioner.

1:06:30.208 --> 1:06:32.958
It's a Maruti gypsy. 6881.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:35.833
You forgot about me?

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:39.208
No, no, there's definitely
a Karan Kapoor connection.

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:40.500
Well...

1:06:41.208 --> 1:06:43.708
Does the stolen phone
have a video on it...

1:06:44.958 --> 1:06:46.875
that's got everyone excited?

1:06:47.750 --> 1:06:48.791
Is that so?

1:07:02.250 --> 1:07:04.250
Happy Holi, bless the blouse-less!

1:07:08.208 --> 1:07:10.666
I need to take my paint off. Please, baby!

1:07:12.875 --> 1:07:15.375
You're filming with my phone,
you idiot. Pervert.

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:17.875
Let's take a sexy selfie.

1:07:17.958 --> 1:07:19.083
Come on. Baby.

1:07:19.166 --> 1:07:20.291
Give me the shower curtain.

1:07:26.041 --> 1:07:28.541
You are so beautiful, Meghu!

1:07:49.708 --> 1:07:51.791
Hello? Commissioner, this is Karan here.

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000
Step out.

1:08:26.166 --> 1:08:27.291
Don't try to run.

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:41.791
Who is Prerna Mathur?

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:46.125
No idea.

1:08:47.041 --> 1:08:47.958
Hmm.

1:08:48.708 --> 1:08:50.125
Did you steal the scooter?

1:08:51.541 --> 1:08:52.500
Did you?

1:08:53.083 --> 1:08:53.958
Yeah.

1:08:57.333 --> 1:08:59.166
What's in the parcel?

1:09:00.666 --> 1:09:01.625
I don't know.

1:09:05.041 --> 1:09:07.375
-Where is the parcel?
-I don't know.

1:09:07.458 --> 1:09:08.500
Where is the parcel?

1:09:08.583 --> 1:09:09.625
I've no clue.

1:09:10.083 --> 1:09:13.541
Don't shoot! She doesn't know anything.

1:09:13.625 --> 1:09:15.166
If you shoot her,
I won't tell you anything.

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:17.166
You're threatening me?

1:09:17.250 --> 1:09:19.416
It's by Chacha's place!

1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:20.791
I already searched his place!

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:23.083
You need to take me with you.

1:09:23.166 --> 1:09:25.208
Please, just let her go!

1:09:32.458 --> 1:09:33.625
Say goodbye.

1:09:53.833 --> 1:09:57.208
Of course, it was a stunt, Jazz.
I was acting too.

1:09:57.458 --> 1:10:00.500
This is Filmcity.
People shoot here.

1:10:04.791 --> 1:10:07.541
My beloved

1:10:10.125 --> 1:10:14.083
My darling

1:10:15.916 --> 1:10:18.291
My beloved

1:10:21.708 --> 1:10:23.583
My darling

1:10:23.666 --> 1:10:26.250
Meghna ma'am!
Are you done with the shooting?

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:29.250
Must you leave me

1:10:32.333 --> 1:10:33.750
Drop the scooter there.

1:10:37.875 --> 1:10:40.625
I've bound myself to you

1:10:40.708 --> 1:10:43.416
I've drowned myself in you

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:46.208
I've bound myself to you

1:10:46.333 --> 1:10:49.000
I've drowned myself in you

1:10:49.083 --> 1:10:51.833
I've bound myself to you

1:10:51.916 --> 1:10:54.583
I've drowned myself in you

1:10:54.666 --> 1:10:57.375
I've bound myself to you

1:10:57.458 --> 1:11:00.208
I've drowned myself in you

1:11:00.458 --> 1:11:03.625
Are we enemies?

1:11:05.833 --> 1:11:09.125
Must we remain so?

1:11:11.916 --> 1:11:16.208
Are we on the path of hope?

1:11:39.666 --> 1:11:42.208
My beloved

1:11:45.041 --> 1:11:48.833
My darling

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:53.041
My beloved

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:59.666
My darling

1:12:01.958 --> 1:12:04.208
Must you leave me

1:12:07.416 --> 1:12:11.916
After all you have seen

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:15.541
I've bound myself to you

1:12:15.625 --> 1:12:18.333
I've drowned myself in you

1:12:18.416 --> 1:12:21.125
I've bound myself to you

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:23.833
I've drowned myself in you

1:12:23.916 --> 1:12:26.666
I've bound myself to you

1:12:26.750 --> 1:12:29.500
I've drowned myself in you

1:12:29.708 --> 1:12:32.333
I've bound myself to you

1:12:32.416 --> 1:12:35.208
I've drowned myself in you

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:40.083
How many times do I need to tell you?
Do you want to blow us up with your phone?

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:47.916
Son, go to Meghna's flat
right away. Papa is there.

1:12:48.333 --> 1:12:50.250
Papa? Papa is in Mumbai?

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.041
Gujral!

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.625
Deputy Home Minister Irawati
can easily unmask this witness!

1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:39.375
Use that video Karan took to put
the squeeze on her ladyship, hello!

1:13:50.291 --> 1:13:53.375
Please tell me you've noted
Gujral's badge number and his station.

1:13:53.875 --> 1:13:54.833
Hey, Dheere!

1:13:55.125 --> 1:13:56.541
What's Gujral's badge number?

1:13:56.625 --> 1:13:57.833
I didn't take it.

1:13:58.250 --> 1:13:59.125
Why not?

1:14:02.958 --> 1:14:04.916
We need to involve
the Police Commissioner.

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.375
He's bound to know something.

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:08.625
After Karan Kapoor punched me

1:14:09.708 --> 1:14:12.791
he called the Commissioner
to complain about Gujral.

1:14:17.916 --> 1:14:23.500
All your indiscretions
will become public

1:14:24.083 --> 1:14:27.000
right in the midst
of my election campaign!

1:14:36.166 --> 1:14:37.458
Sir must be busy.

1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:39.458
Shall I call back?

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.041
Who's this?

1:14:44.125 --> 1:14:46.083
Inspector Gujral, CID.

1:14:46.291 --> 1:14:48.416
How can we help you, sir?

1:14:48.666 --> 1:14:50.208
We found a video on this phone.

1:14:53.250 --> 1:14:54.750
What kind of video?

1:14:55.291 --> 1:14:58.333
The kind that ruins lives.

1:15:00.125 --> 1:15:03.458
Actually, Meghna Shergill's peon
is in my custody.

1:15:04.250 --> 1:15:06.708
The peon was blackmailing her,

1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:09.000
but his real target was you.

1:15:10.791 --> 1:15:13.916
This peon...

1:15:14.541 --> 1:15:15.375
Whom does he work for?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:16.750
What does he want from me?

1:15:17.291 --> 1:15:19.041
The name of a witness.

1:15:22.583 --> 1:15:25.916
It's about tomorrow's trial.

1:15:28.625 --> 1:15:31.500
The one involving
the famous encounter specialist.

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:35.125
Hey, listen.
Why don't you get to the point?

1:15:35.458 --> 1:15:36.833
One moment.

1:15:38.208 --> 1:15:42.750
To protect the witness from these goons,
we need extra security.

1:15:43.125 --> 1:15:46.708
I am ready to volunteer.
It's my duty after all.

1:15:48.375 --> 1:15:51.375
I... can talk to the Police Chief.

1:15:54.291 --> 1:15:56.166
You have a word in his ear.

1:15:56.458 --> 1:15:58.541
Mr. Gujrat, this, uh...

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:01.083
video...

1:16:02.791 --> 1:16:04.333
I want to see it.

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.083
Ira.

1:16:09.291 --> 1:16:10.708
Ira, listen to me--

1:16:13.583 --> 1:16:16.000
If your friend is really lucky,

1:16:16.333 --> 1:16:18.583
she may just lose one leg.

1:16:19.583 --> 1:16:20.625
What?

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:23.375
How much did Chacha pay you?

1:16:25.666 --> 1:16:26.833
300 rupees.

1:16:33.791 --> 1:16:35.708
He used to make bombs.

1:16:38.291 --> 1:16:41.750
Mostly to entrap people
for the Encounter squad.

1:16:46.458 --> 1:16:50.083
Wherever your parcel is delivered

1:16:50.208 --> 1:16:51.958
at whatever time...

1:16:54.208 --> 1:16:55.666
We will soon find that out.

1:16:58.583 --> 1:17:01.333
Pray to God it's not RDX.

1:17:16.500 --> 1:17:17.666
It's not your fault.

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:20.000
You're the delivery boy

1:17:20.083 --> 1:17:22.916
who delivers on time, guaranteed.

1:17:23.166 --> 1:17:25.333
You're a man of your words
and you'd give your life.

1:17:39.750 --> 1:17:42.625
Uh, at least her belongings are here.

1:17:45.541 --> 1:17:48.833
-Yes, madam, tell me.
-Sorry to trouble you on Sunday.

1:17:48.916 --> 1:17:52.375
It's about the Star Witness case.

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.208
The Pandya case.

1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:02.041
The government should perhaps
provide extra security to the witness.

1:18:02.583 --> 1:18:07.000
A CID Inspector is already
looking into it. Gujral?

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:09.416
He's the one who threatened Karan today.

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:13.041
Don't worry about that.
It was a misunderstanding, in fact.

1:18:13.125 --> 1:18:16.041
It will be better
if you stay out of this, ma'am.

1:18:16.291 --> 1:18:17.208
Why?

1:18:17.416 --> 1:18:18.875
I am the Deputy Home Minister.

1:18:18.958 --> 1:18:23.041
But there's no time to check out Gujral.

1:18:26.125 --> 1:18:28.208
Will you take the blame

1:18:28.416 --> 1:18:31.208
if, just in case, something goes wrong?

1:18:31.291 --> 1:18:32.958
All of us are responsible, ma'am.

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:35.125
Ah! So...

1:18:35.208 --> 1:18:38.125
I'll tell Gujral. He'll contact you.

1:18:45.583 --> 1:18:49.625
Roy, search the system for a CID Gujral.

1:18:52.458 --> 1:18:54.916
She may be near Grant Road

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.166
on the way to St Anne's.

1:18:56.250 --> 1:18:59.416
I'm in a boat. I can't come out.

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:01.583
I asked her to deliver something.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.666
Uncle, it might be RDX.

1:19:05.250 --> 1:19:06.458
RDX?

1:19:06.750 --> 1:19:08.750
She's to arrive at 8:30.

1:19:08.833 --> 1:19:12.291
And whoever Gujral is,
he's hunting some witness--

1:19:22.375 --> 1:19:25.083
St Anne's Church,
Grant Road, 8:30 p.m.

1:19:25.375 --> 1:19:27.458
What has St. Anne's Church
to do with this?

1:19:27.666 --> 1:19:29.041
That's for you to find out.

1:19:29.416 --> 1:19:30.625
Get me the boss.

1:19:30.958 --> 1:19:33.166
He's not available.
You'll have back up.

1:19:33.250 --> 1:19:34.500
I don't want backup.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:38.500
People are on to you.
The commissioner is involved too.

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:40.708
I said I don't need back up!

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:44.208
It's not in your hands.
Stand by for orders.

1:19:51.375 --> 1:19:52.875
Connection broken.

1:19:53.458 --> 1:19:55.416
Who is our back up?

1:19:55.916 --> 1:19:56.958
Rathore.

1:19:58.916 --> 1:20:01.375
When he's in position, connect us.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:04.791
Why didn't you mention St Anne's?

1:20:04.875 --> 1:20:06.333
How does he know?

1:20:06.583 --> 1:20:08.333
We've been roaming around since morning!
Why didn't you tell me?

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:10.166
A courier's code is silence!

1:20:10.250 --> 1:20:12.958
There's a tap on both phones!

1:20:14.166 --> 1:20:15.166
A tap?

1:20:25.333 --> 1:20:28.250
Look, I don't know who's chasing who,

1:20:28.541 --> 1:20:31.541
I just don't want that girl
to die in a bomb blast

1:20:31.666 --> 1:20:32.500
but--

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:57.541
My child,

1:20:58.666 --> 1:21:00.166
Since you are reading this

1:21:00.666 --> 1:21:03.416
it means my trusty courier

1:21:04.083 --> 1:21:08.208
has delivered your scooter
to Father Daniel.

1:21:10.916 --> 1:21:14.083
You can have faith in this man

1:21:14.958 --> 1:21:17.000
to not to open the parcel

1:21:17.541 --> 1:21:20.791
nor talk of it to anyone.

1:21:27.208 --> 1:21:30.250
We've seen so much in the last five years.

1:21:31.583 --> 1:21:33.541
You taught me much.

1:21:34.166 --> 1:21:37.000
Now you must go on...

1:21:38.125 --> 1:21:39.208
without me.

1:21:48.791 --> 1:21:51.833
Tomorrow, when you're
the star witness,

1:21:52.583 --> 1:21:55.458
I may not be in court with you.

1:22:03.958 --> 1:22:07.500
My written testimony
must reach Commissioner Wadia

1:22:07.916 --> 1:22:10.416
who has wanted justice
for Stanley D'Mello for years now.

1:22:40.333 --> 1:22:43.083
I discovered later...

1:22:44.083 --> 1:22:47.541
why Don Arun Naik was used...

1:22:49.583 --> 1:22:51.291
for such a gruesome job.

1:22:56.541 --> 1:23:00.208
Someone wished for Stanley D'Mello

1:23:00.291 --> 1:23:05.458
to take revenge
on the Don's gang and family...

1:23:09.125 --> 1:23:11.416
for the murder of his wife.

1:23:14.416 --> 1:23:18.541
No one could link your
mother's death to Pandya...

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:21.833
except you.

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:38.750
You, and Pandya's driver, Ramakanth...

1:23:40.791 --> 1:23:43.333
both drowned...

1:23:47.166 --> 1:23:48.458
in a sea of silence.

1:23:51.541 --> 1:23:54.333
From the shell of a shattered family...

1:23:55.333 --> 1:23:58.208
Pandya created a hollow killing machine.

1:23:59.666 --> 1:24:01.916
That left you like an orphan.

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:09.291
Your only sanctuary...

1:24:11.458 --> 1:24:16.166
was the place your family
visited on Sundays.

1:24:18.541 --> 1:24:20.041
St. Anne's Church.

1:24:25.250 --> 1:24:27.000
-Sir, Rathore.
-Hmm.

1:24:28.916 --> 1:24:31.416
Rathore, listen up.

1:24:31.875 --> 1:24:34.291
This concerns national security.

1:24:34.666 --> 1:24:37.958
Your target is a CID officer

1:24:38.750 --> 1:24:42.541
and there is one more target
that you need to identify.

1:24:54.791 --> 1:24:56.583
-Look, Dheere.
-Huh?

1:24:58.583 --> 1:25:01.375
Our country's two heroes,
looking in the same direction

1:25:02.791 --> 1:25:04.916
but with different weapons.

1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:08.750
A bit like us.

1:25:11.666 --> 1:25:13.416
You pack a pistol.

1:25:15.125 --> 1:25:16.458
I don't.

1:25:19.333 --> 1:25:21.458
Giving you a pistol
would be a mistake.

1:25:25.541 --> 1:25:26.958
They have to be fired sometimes.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.375
-Has anyone spoken to them?
-No, they've been in your office.

1:25:32.458 --> 1:25:35.791
Has Gurjal made contact?

1:25:35.875 --> 1:25:38.708
No. Sorry, sir,
I couldn't find out much about him.

1:25:38.791 --> 1:25:40.125
-Dig deeper!
-Sir.

1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.375
I want transcripts from
that stolen phone, now!

1:25:44.458 --> 1:25:46.541
Sir, they're on your desk.

1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.958
Sir, the number has been monitored
since morning.

1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:54.791
On whose authority?

1:25:55.166 --> 1:25:56.250
Sir, yours.

1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:58.708
Sit over there.

1:26:01.708 --> 1:26:05.375
Monitor all phones
in contact with that number.

1:26:05.458 --> 1:26:07.458
And show me all authorizations!

1:26:12.041 --> 1:26:13.083
So...

1:26:15.875 --> 1:26:18.791
How did you two hear about this witness?

1:26:23.166 --> 1:26:24.500
I've reached the location.

1:26:31.250 --> 1:26:33.458
The pink scooter is here.
A woman is riding it.

1:26:34.833 --> 1:26:38.375
See who she meets at 8:30.

1:26:38.458 --> 1:26:42.250
Looks like she's delivering a parcel.

1:26:43.333 --> 1:26:45.500
-Any sign of Gujral?
-Not yet.

1:26:46.166 --> 1:26:49.625
So whoever the girl gives the parcel to
is our target.

1:26:49.791 --> 1:26:53.666
Rejoice, rejoice

1:26:53.750 --> 1:26:57.000
Emmanuel

1:27:01.250 --> 1:27:05.625
Father Daniel allowed me
to put his signature

1:27:06.041 --> 1:27:09.916
on Alice's death certificate,
and all public records.

1:27:11.708 --> 1:27:12.875
Alice!

1:27:17.708 --> 1:27:19.583
Inside is all you need

1:27:20.708 --> 1:27:23.250
to become Prerna Mathur.

1:27:24.166 --> 1:27:25.625
Who's Prerna Mathur?

1:28:19.125 --> 1:28:21.583
Please wait here. Wait here.

1:28:22.041 --> 1:28:23.083
Uh...

1:28:25.708 --> 1:28:28.541
If only we were born
with the knowledge...

1:28:29.791 --> 1:28:32.208
that we gained by life's end.

1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:33.583
Gujral is here.

1:28:37.125 --> 1:28:38.500
We need that parcel.

1:28:39.708 --> 1:28:42.625
That we are all part
of one living being.

1:28:46.333 --> 1:28:48.458
The bonding inside the concrete.

1:28:50.958 --> 1:28:54.291
Here's your parcel.
And the keys to your scooter.

1:28:54.875 --> 1:28:57.291
I'm underage for a scooter.

1:28:58.041 --> 1:29:00.250
What was Chacha thinking?

1:29:00.583 --> 1:29:02.750
I won't be able to big goodbye.

1:29:04.583 --> 1:29:07.791
I can only leave you a poem of Kabir's...

1:29:09.125 --> 1:29:11.041
in which I see myself.

1:29:14.416 --> 1:29:16.625
"I went in search of a crooked fellow

1:29:18.083 --> 1:29:19.791
Looked far away and near

1:29:22.375 --> 1:29:24.375
When I got home and looked inward

1:29:27.708 --> 1:29:29.458
I found him already here

1:29:35.708 --> 1:29:38.708
I will offer these words to my maker

1:29:42.166 --> 1:29:44.625
Whenever we may meet"

1:29:58.416 --> 1:29:59.958
CID Gujral.

1:30:00.375 --> 1:30:01.708
We've been informed of a bomb.

1:30:01.791 --> 1:30:03.291
-Please move out.
-Bomb?

1:30:03.375 --> 1:30:04.875
Outside, hurry.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:09.041
There is a bomb inside. Please leave.

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:10.875
Sir, outside.

1:30:11.333 --> 1:30:12.458
For your safety...

1:30:13.833 --> 1:30:15.541
-Leave this here.
-Please move out.

1:30:16.625 --> 1:30:19.791
Close the doors, Father.
No one enters unless I say.

1:30:19.875 --> 1:30:22.041
Leave the church. Leave!

1:30:31.208 --> 1:30:32.166
What are you doing?

1:30:39.250 --> 1:30:41.916
Children! Who wants a present?

1:30:42.958 --> 1:30:44.041
What's going on?

1:30:51.583 --> 1:30:54.375
That girl on the scooter
is handing parcels to everyone.

1:31:02.916 --> 1:31:04.625
-Someone is with her.
-Who?

1:31:04.708 --> 1:31:09.041
Well, Santa's friend...
who looks like a camel..

1:31:10.166 --> 1:31:11.750
Yeah... Rundeer!

1:31:18.166 --> 1:31:19.583
More people have arrived.

1:31:24.333 --> 1:31:26.875
Gujral, or whatever he's called,
is here already.

1:31:28.250 --> 1:31:30.041
They're hugging each other.

1:31:31.291 --> 1:31:32.333
Oh.

1:31:34.208 --> 1:31:37.416
Don't worry. Everyone's coming.
My mummy, daddy,

1:31:37.500 --> 1:31:39.250
-my brother-in-law, the commissioner--
-Papa?

1:31:47.916 --> 1:31:49.833
He thinks I'm Mohit.

1:31:50.375 --> 1:31:53.125
If it makes life easier for you
we can stay engaged.

1:31:53.208 --> 1:31:54.791
Break it off later if you like--

1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:14.583
Alice.

1:32:23.416 --> 1:32:24.500
Gujral?

1:32:24.708 --> 1:32:27.666
Santa and Rundeer are holding hands.

1:32:27.750 --> 1:32:29.166
Everyone's looking somewhere else.

1:32:29.583 --> 1:32:30.541
I can't quite see.

1:32:38.791 --> 1:32:40.000
-Hatman!
-Pintu!

1:32:40.083 --> 1:32:43.166
-Meghna!
-What's going on?

1:32:45.083 --> 1:32:46.458
Take good care of her.

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.500
Papa. My parents.

1:32:50.750 --> 1:32:52.208
What about the RDX?

1:32:54.458 --> 1:32:57.708
Hey, do you have a phone?
I need to make a call, please.

1:32:58.333 --> 1:33:00.291
It'll cost you.

1:33:00.750 --> 1:33:03.083
Here, take all of it.

1:33:05.416 --> 1:33:09.041
-There's... zero credit left.
-What?

1:33:14.291 --> 1:33:15.583
Where's the bomb?

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.041
-Now what?
-Commissioner Wadia is here.

1:33:18.166 --> 1:33:19.750
Everyone freeze! Nobody moves!

1:33:20.833 --> 1:33:22.125
God bless you.

1:33:22.958 --> 1:33:24.791
-Greetings.
-Sir, family, sir.

1:33:24.875 --> 1:33:26.375
Is your entire family involved?

1:33:26.458 --> 1:33:28.083
Is this for me?

1:33:30.833 --> 1:33:33.583
-Give it to me.
-One minute.

1:33:33.666 --> 1:33:36.333
Okay, the boy has the parcel.

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:41.333
They're playing pass-the-parcel.

1:33:41.416 --> 1:33:43.083
Where's Gujral?

1:33:56.291 --> 1:33:58.333
The parcel is with the commissioner now.

1:34:09.833 --> 1:34:11.000
Kill Wadia.

1:34:13.791 --> 1:34:15.166
Shoot everybody.

1:34:20.333 --> 1:34:23.125
Get away from here! Go! Move!

1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:38.458
There's no answer from Rathore, sir.

1:34:38.833 --> 1:34:39.708
One second.

1:34:39.791 --> 1:34:41.541
There is an incoming call
on Sharma's phone.

1:34:42.375 --> 1:34:43.208
Go inside.

1:34:43.291 --> 1:34:44.666
Listen to me carefully.

1:34:44.750 --> 1:34:46.791
The St. Anne's parcel is a decoy.

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:48.583
I have the real parcel.

1:34:48.666 --> 1:34:49.708
Huh?

1:34:50.375 --> 1:34:51.500
Where are you?

1:34:51.583 --> 1:34:52.500
Never mind.

1:34:52.583 --> 1:34:54.250
Send someone to collect the parcel.

1:34:54.333 --> 1:34:56.125
They'll find it in a canoe

1:34:56.208 --> 1:35:00.000
behind Jesus's shrine
which is beyond the Worli Fort.

1:35:03.250 --> 1:35:04.958
What's a Jesus shrine?

1:35:05.041 --> 1:35:06.125
Church.

1:35:08.166 --> 1:35:09.250
Which church are they talking about?

1:35:09.333 --> 1:35:10.375
It's in Koliwada.

1:35:11.708 --> 1:35:13.750
And what do we do there?

1:35:13.833 --> 1:35:14.916
Fetch the parcel.

1:35:18.208 --> 1:35:19.375
Listen.

1:35:19.750 --> 1:35:22.583
This is your phone.
Take it away and destroy it.

1:35:23.625 --> 1:35:25.208
Merry Christmas. Go!

1:35:58.166 --> 1:36:01.791
Ma'am, I didn't approve
any additional security

1:36:02.041 --> 1:36:03.958
which you wanted Gujral to provide,

1:36:04.041 --> 1:36:06.208
because there's no Gujral in our system.

1:36:07.666 --> 1:36:11.875
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need you and Karan
to reach St. Anne's Church at Grant Road.

1:36:12.750 --> 1:36:13.916
Are you summoning me?

1:36:14.416 --> 1:36:18.041
You decide whether you want to be summoned
by the court or me.

1:36:18.791 --> 1:36:20.208
We're all responsible, aren't we?

1:36:24.958 --> 1:36:27.166
Uncle Terrorist went that way.

1:36:28.625 --> 1:36:30.166
That was Mr. D'Mello.

1:36:33.250 --> 1:36:34.208
Who is he?

1:36:35.166 --> 1:36:36.583
Police! Hands up!

1:36:36.666 --> 1:36:37.750
Where did you...

1:36:38.833 --> 1:36:40.291
What are you doing?

1:36:40.791 --> 1:36:41.708
It's me!

1:36:44.208 --> 1:36:45.500
The parcel.

1:36:46.291 --> 1:36:48.833
That's in the other church.

1:36:49.083 --> 1:36:50.541
-What?
-Yeah.

1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.041
Then what's this?

1:37:17.041 --> 1:37:19.208
My plan was to trap Gujral.

1:37:21.041 --> 1:37:22.750
But this thug showed up.

1:37:22.958 --> 1:37:25.791
Will I have to pay for all his crimes?

1:37:26.083 --> 1:37:27.958
He thinks we're all idiots.

1:37:28.458 --> 1:37:30.791
-Put me in another jail.
-Which jail?

1:37:30.875 --> 1:37:33.291
Who are you talking about? Get up!

1:37:34.416 --> 1:37:35.666
You don't get it.

1:37:38.458 --> 1:37:40.166
He will drive me crazy!

1:37:42.541 --> 1:37:44.666
A wise man once said...

1:37:53.416 --> 1:37:56.208
"Knowingly or unknowingly
we decide to meet...

1:38:05.750 --> 1:38:07.166
because our decisions bind us."

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:15.375
"In this great city...

1:38:17.791 --> 1:38:20.875
you can go from strangers
to becoming friends in one night.

1:38:24.583 --> 1:38:26.125
Friends who are like family."

1:38:38.166 --> 1:38:40.375
"How much ever we run from people...

1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.166
thinking people are the problem..."

1:38:51.041 --> 1:38:52.583
I mean, it's true.

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:55.583
We do cause each other's problems...

1:39:02.750 --> 1:39:05.041
but we are also a part of their solution.

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.416
I'm sorely tempted to lock you all up

1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:15.958
till this trial is complete.

1:39:27.916 --> 1:39:30.958
We are, as the wise man put it...

1:39:34.250 --> 1:39:36.333
"All part of one living being."

1:39:37.583 --> 1:39:39.958
"And our bonding is
as strong as concrete."

1:39:40.041 --> 1:39:41.083
Repeat after me.

1:39:41.166 --> 1:39:42.666
-I...
-"I."

1:39:43.333 --> 1:39:44.416
...solemnly swear...

1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:45.875
"Solemnly swear..."

1:39:45.958 --> 1:39:48.833
-...that the star witness...
-"...that the star witness..."

1:39:48.916 --> 1:39:51.625
-...prior identity...
-"...prior identity..."

1:39:51.708 --> 1:39:55.833
-...shall never be revealed by me.
-"...shall never be revealed by me."

1:39:55.916 --> 1:39:58.458
-As long as I live.
-"As long as I live."

1:39:58.541 --> 1:40:00.791
-Victory to India!
-"Victory to India!"

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.583
-Victory to India!
-"Victory to India!"

1:40:06.041 --> 1:40:10.833
The public discovered how Pandya
finished off an entire gang

1:40:12.208 --> 1:40:13.583
by instigating D'Mello.

1:40:17.208 --> 1:40:19.708
All for the hundred million
that some other gang

1:40:19.791 --> 1:40:21.791
invested in Satya Rahi Party!

1:40:26.041 --> 1:40:29.875
Now each night... he lies awake

1:40:30.541 --> 1:40:33.041
fearing a visit from D'Mello.

1:40:35.875 --> 1:40:37.541
And his old driver...

1:40:38.625 --> 1:40:42.500
who had kept his secret
during years of abuse...

1:40:44.666 --> 1:40:46.208
suddenly found courage...

1:40:50.333 --> 1:40:52.000
to become a State Approver.

1:40:54.833 --> 1:40:57.291
The point here is
if we want to change the system,

1:40:57.375 --> 1:41:00.458
we need to change how politicians think.

1:41:01.625 --> 1:41:04.166
We don't make laws.
Laws are made by the State.

1:41:04.250 --> 1:41:06.208
We just enforce them. That's all.

1:41:06.291 --> 1:41:07.750
India's first

1:41:08.791 --> 1:41:10.958
Witness Protection Program

1:41:11.333 --> 1:41:14.166
otherwise known as the
Gawah Suraksha Karyakram.

1:41:27.041 --> 1:41:29.500
Apparently Pandya has a mental illness

1:41:30.083 --> 1:41:31.375
caused by idiots,

1:41:33.041 --> 1:41:34.958
meaning all of us.

1:41:39.625 --> 1:41:43.333
I feel I fit right in
with all the other idiots

1:41:43.958 --> 1:41:45.458
who are out there

1:41:46.708 --> 1:41:49.083
trying to be the change
we want to see in our world.

1:41:51.708 --> 1:41:54.166
I want to ask the Commissioner,

1:41:54.250 --> 1:41:56.333
who hasn't come on my TV show for a while.

1:41:56.416 --> 1:41:59.291
A few years back,
Stanley D'Mello disappeared.

1:42:00.125 --> 1:42:02.000
Are you closer to solving that mystery?

1:42:02.708 --> 1:42:06.041
Some incidents
are meant to remain mysteries.

1:42:07.875 --> 1:42:10.666
Anyway, among us today,

1:42:10.750 --> 1:42:14.000
is someone I'm really thankful to.

1:42:14.083 --> 1:42:17.083
I want him to be recognized by the world.

1:42:17.166 --> 1:42:18.833
Which is why, next month

1:42:18.916 --> 1:42:21.916
Sub-inspector Dhanendra Patil,
will go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.583
to receive the President's Police Medal

1:42:25.125 --> 1:42:26.416
for gallantry.

1:42:41.875 --> 1:42:43.208
Mr. Dhanendra Patil.

1:42:45.750 --> 1:42:47.291
How are you feeling, Mr. Patil?

1:43:29.208 --> 1:43:32.041
Name one superhero
who doesn't have a sad private life?

1:44:08.541 --> 1:44:14.666
I made up my mind
And set out to accomplish something

1:44:15.666 --> 1:44:18.416
My Lord

1:44:22.500 --> 1:44:27.958
I made up my mind
And set out to accomplish something

1:44:28.041 --> 1:44:30.791
I set out to accomplish something

1:44:30.875 --> 1:44:36.500
Whatever I need
I will take it from You right now

1:44:36.833 --> 1:44:39.666
I will bow down

1:44:39.750 --> 1:44:42.458
I will bow down to You

1:44:42.541 --> 1:44:45.833
I will bow down

1:44:45.916 --> 1:44:47.333
I will bow down to You

1:44:47.416 --> 1:44:50.166
My Lord

1:45:00.333 --> 1:45:02.125
Get lost from here

1:45:14.083 --> 1:45:16.916
The night is long and the cars are big

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.625
There are hundreds of people
We think about

1:45:19.708 --> 1:45:21.750
You have to be careful

1:45:25.416 --> 1:45:28.125
Increase the speed

1:45:28.208 --> 1:45:30.916
And increase the heat
By wearing a backless blouse

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.916
You have to be careful

1:45:36.583 --> 1:45:39.333
You love roaming around

1:45:39.416 --> 1:45:42.083
You aren't bothered about eating

1:45:42.166 --> 1:45:43.875
You have to be careful

1:45:47.750 --> 1:45:50.416
Hey, chant God's name
And get all the stuff here

1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:53.208
Then throw it all in the river

1:45:53.333 --> 1:45:56.041
I know what brought you here

1:45:56.125 --> 1:45:58.833
There will be a lot of confusion
You better pull up your socks

1:45:59.250 --> 1:46:00.583
Shall we earn or shall we vote?

1:46:00.666 --> 1:46:01.916
What do we do?

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:04.583
Everyone around us is waiting
But the system is down

1:46:04.666 --> 1:46:05.833
Hey, weirdo

1:46:05.916 --> 1:46:08.541
Give me the OTP
Hey, weirdo

1:46:08.666 --> 1:46:09.958
Hey, weirdo

1:46:10.375 --> 1:46:12.916
You have all the news in the world
And you're not scared of God

1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.833
You keep posting weird stuff
On social media

1:46:15.916 --> 1:46:17.833
Hey, weirdo

1:46:54.708 --> 1:46:57.416
You've made so many preparations

1:46:57.541 --> 1:47:00.208
But we'll remain friends
Only for a few days

1:47:00.291 --> 1:47:05.833
Who will take your responsibility?

1:47:05.916 --> 1:47:08.583
You are an honest person

1:47:08.666 --> 1:47:11.375
And your lovers are businessmen

1:47:11.458 --> 1:47:17.000
We never know when you might
Do something magical

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:21.458
You don't put up with anyone's bullshit

1:47:22.625 --> 1:47:25.250
Don't pass by the adjacent lane

1:47:25.333 --> 1:47:28.083
There are boys waiting to tease you

1:47:28.166 --> 1:47:29.916
You have to be careful

1:47:33.791 --> 1:47:36.541
You love roaming around

1:47:36.625 --> 1:47:39.291
You aren't bothered about eating

1:47:39.375 --> 1:47:41.083
You have to be careful

1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:46.708
Hey, sinner

1:48:04.458 --> 1:48:06.166
Get lost from here
