WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:06.140
* That's a game
that I hate to lose *

00:06.174 --> 00:10.111
* And I'm feeling the strain *

00:10.144 --> 00:11.779
* Ain't it a shame? *

00:11.812 --> 00:15.183
* Oh, give me the beat, boys,
and free my soul *

00:15.216 --> 00:18.519
* I wanna get lost
in your rock and roll *

00:18.552 --> 00:20.321
* And drift away

00:20.354 --> 00:24.392
* Oh, give me the beat, boys,
and free my soul *

00:24.425 --> 00:27.228
* I wanna get lost
in your rock and roll *

00:27.261 --> 00:29.463
* And drift away...

00:40.774 --> 00:45.613
* Beginning to think
that I'm wasting time *

00:47.515 --> 00:52.453
* I don't understand
the things I do *

00:54.222 --> 00:58.592
* Girl, outside looks
so unkind *

01:00.194 --> 01:03.164
* I'm counting on you *

01:03.197 --> 01:05.733
* To carry me through

01:05.766 --> 01:09.237
* Oh, give me the beat, boys,
and free my soul *

01:09.270 --> 01:11.772
* I wanna get lost
in your rock and roll *

01:11.805 --> 01:13.374
* And drift away...

01:16.544 --> 01:19.547
DAVID: The victim's husband,
Judge Franklin Trelane,

01:19.580 --> 01:20.714
Central Division.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.749
When did he get here?

01:21.782 --> 01:24.352
The marshals drove him over
about half an hour ago.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.886
He was right in the
middle of a trial.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.188
What's the trial about?

01:27.221 --> 01:28.722
Asian gang-bangers;

01:28.756 --> 01:29.890
death penalty case.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.225
We've already started
running down

01:31.259 --> 01:33.294
the defendant's
known associates.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.728
Her car was in the shop.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.564
She borrowed his.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.700
COLBY: You know, you take the
oath,

01:39.733 --> 01:41.435
they give us a gun, we
go into public service

01:41.469 --> 01:43.371
with our eyes open,
but nobody tells us

01:43.404 --> 01:45.072
our families are fair game.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.440
They're not.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.241
( sighs )

01:47.275 --> 01:49.177
DAVID: Spray pattern suggests
that, um,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.378
the guy waited
for her to pull in,

01:50.411 --> 01:51.745
for the garage door to close,

01:51.779 --> 01:52.913
and he opened fire.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.248
Probably waiting
on this side,

01:54.282 --> 01:56.250
He could've rubbed
up against any of this stuff,

01:56.284 --> 01:57.351
- so let's check this.
- TECH: Yes, sir.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.986
If the suspect's
breaking into the garage,

01:59.019 --> 02:00.688
the victim comes in
and surprises him...

02:00.721 --> 02:02.890
12-gauge isn't
a burglar's tool, though.

02:02.923 --> 02:03.891
You got four shots,

02:03.924 --> 02:05.159
point blank--
ain't a surprise.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.161
That's premeditation.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.129
So murder was the object.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.664
I'm just wondering
who the target was--

02:10.698 --> 02:14.368
the wife or the judge?

02:14.402 --> 02:18.005
( echoing ):
We all use math every day...

02:18.038 --> 02:19.540
to predict weather...

02:19.573 --> 02:22.310
to tell time...

02:22.343 --> 02:25.646
to handle money...

02:25.679 --> 02:29.850
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.352
It's logic.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.854
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.489
It's rationality.

02:35.523 --> 02:39.560
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.937
MEGAN: We searched the criminal
histories

02:49.970 --> 02:51.439
and the psych profiles

02:51.472 --> 02:53.941
that might have a tilt
towards retaliation

02:53.974 --> 02:56.109
and the inclination
to act on it.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.811
Now, are you assuming

02:57.845 --> 02:59.112
that Alison
Trelane's killer

02:59.146 --> 03:01.782
is someone that the
husband put in jail?

03:01.815 --> 03:02.783
Yeah.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.718
We're thinking the judge
was the intended target,

03:04.752 --> 03:05.453
not the wife.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.287
Right, no, yeah, I-I understand,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.289
but, uh, your suspects
aren't limited

03:08.322 --> 03:10.758
only to people who were
convicted by the judge, right?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.327
That's right;
there's also family members,

03:13.361 --> 03:14.995
friends, co-conspirators...

03:15.028 --> 03:17.531
The possibilities
are exponential.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.199
Um...

03:19.233 --> 03:21.168
"exponential" would mean that
the growth rate

03:21.201 --> 03:23.604
is proportionate to its size,
so, yeah,

03:23.637 --> 03:25.906
the mathematically
correct term would be...

03:25.939 --> 03:27.675
"more."
( wry laugh )

03:33.847 --> 03:35.549
Well, call it whatever
you want, Charlie,

03:35.583 --> 03:36.517
but, I mean...

03:36.550 --> 03:39.687
I mean, this is going
to take a lot of time.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.054
Not necessarily.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.823
You can create

03:42.856 --> 03:43.924
a Bayesian filter.

03:43.957 --> 03:44.925
I could,

03:44.958 --> 03:46.994
if I had any idea
what that meant.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.030
Do you ever get
any junk e-mail or spam?

03:50.063 --> 03:50.831
Yeah.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.566
Well, that's why they
create spam filters--

03:52.600 --> 03:54.668
to filter out junk e-mail
from regular e-mail.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.137
And spam filters are Bayesian
filters, and what they do

03:57.170 --> 03:59.106
is they calculate
the probabilities

03:59.139 --> 04:00.107
that an e-mail

04:00.140 --> 04:02.175
is spam, given that it has
certain words

04:02.209 --> 04:06.013
like, uh, "refinance,"
"stocks," "Viagra."

04:06.046 --> 04:08.048
And you can do
something similar

04:08.081 --> 04:10.050
to narrow down
the list of suspects?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.552
I can create a filter
that uses

04:11.585 --> 04:13.687
your criteria
to reduce the list of suspects

04:13.721 --> 04:17.325
to people most likely to kill
a judge's wife.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.834
Judge Franklin Trelane's
been on the bench 18 years;

04:26.867 --> 04:29.370
12 before that as a
federal prosecutor.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.904
I figured I'd
start generating

04:30.938 --> 04:32.039
threat assessments.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.206
Threat assessments?!

04:33.240 --> 04:34.542
Yeah, Granger.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.077
Behavioral analyses
based on documentation--

04:37.110 --> 04:39.079
court transcripts,
death threats,

04:39.112 --> 04:40.714
pre-sentencing
psych evals.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.150
Right.
In other words, profiling.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.685
You make it sound
like a bad word.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.953
No, just never thought
"coulda, woulda, shoulda"

04:45.986 --> 04:49.256
figured very well
into a homicide investigation.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.491
COLBY: What? What's she gonna
tell us--

04:50.524 --> 04:52.860
the guy we're looking for
had a bad childhood?

04:52.893 --> 04:55.496
You know, not all sociopaths
have bad childhoods.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.497
As a matter of fact,

04:56.530 --> 04:58.399
some law enforcement
personnel exhibit

04:58.432 --> 05:00.534
the same characteristics.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.102
COLBY:
Yeah, well, not this one.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.472
If it quacks like a Duc...

05:05.806 --> 05:07.408
DAVID: Defendant facing the
death penalty

05:07.441 --> 05:08.576
in front of Trelane.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.378
Sort of fits the profile
of a guy who might want

05:10.411 --> 05:11.779
to whack his judge, huh?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.381
Yeah.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.189
I'm sorry for the timing.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.391
Don't be, Agent.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.460
We both have our work to get to.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.929
Can you think of anyone
who might have a motive

05:28.962 --> 05:29.930
for killing
your wife?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.231
Someone who objected to her work

05:31.264 --> 05:33.000
for the American
Heart Association

05:33.033 --> 05:34.768
or a fellow member
of her horticulture club?

05:34.802 --> 05:38.772
This murder was an attack on me,
on the bench.

05:38.806 --> 05:39.807
We both know that.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.942
And the case
you're trying now...

05:41.975 --> 05:42.910
Duc Lu Phan.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.112
He's a leader
of a local street gang.

05:45.145 --> 05:45.913
Facing you
for the death penalty.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.248
I realize that, but if I talk
to you any more about him,

05:48.281 --> 05:49.817
I'll have to walk away
from the case.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.285
All right, well, we're going to
try to run it down another way,

05:52.319 --> 05:53.320
but you should be prepared
for that.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.455
I'm sure his lawyer will make

05:54.488 --> 05:55.723
a motion to have me step aside,

05:55.756 --> 05:57.558
but I'd rather make
that decision on my own.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.827
Yes, I-I understand.

06:01.895 --> 06:04.364
Violence and tragedy--

06:04.398 --> 06:05.866
they walk
through my courtroom

06:05.899 --> 06:07.067
five days a week,

06:07.100 --> 06:08.969
and I assign them values.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.972
Your grief is worth five years,
hers is worth 20.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.443
One of those decisions
killed Alison.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.415
What is my grief worth?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.822
So, what's "JFM," Duc?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.358
Name's Danny.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.495
Danny. Well, then,
what's "JFM," Danny?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.896
It stands for
"Just For Money."

06:35.929 --> 06:39.132
It's an L.A.-based
Vietnamese street gang.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.201
Community support organization.
( David scoffs )

06:41.234 --> 06:42.235
The "community
support"

06:42.269 --> 06:43.236
includes the kidnapping

06:43.270 --> 06:44.905
and murder of Asian immigrants.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.407
COLBY: Yeah, okay, I got that
right here.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.842
Wow, I see you were

06:48.876 --> 06:51.344
just convicted
on multiple kidnapping

06:51.378 --> 06:53.213
and murder charges.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.014
Look at this--

06:54.047 --> 06:57.117
the presiding judge
is Franklin Trelane.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.385
Why am I not surprised?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.787
A judge's wife

06:59.820 --> 07:02.222
gets killed,
you blame it on the guy

07:02.255 --> 07:03.657
you can find the fastest.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.925
You know,
the fact is

07:04.958 --> 07:07.995
you are the name
on everyone's lips.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.196
And, yeah,

07:09.229 --> 07:10.197
I wouldn't want to be you

07:10.230 --> 07:11.198
in Franklin Trelane's courtroom.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.299
That's exactly what I'm saying.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.366
I've got no motive

07:13.400 --> 07:15.168
- to put a hit out on her.
- What about someone

07:15.202 --> 07:16.637
who's trying to do you a favor?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.638
What kind of favor
would that be?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.640
That's exactly what I'm saying.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.612
Raymond.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.114
You mean Raymond Hmong,
your number-two man?

07:27.147 --> 07:29.249
We've had a few beefs
since I been locked up, but...

07:29.282 --> 07:30.250
But you get
the needle,

07:30.283 --> 07:33.153
Raymond moves up
to number one, right?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.993
It's my
favorite G-man.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.030
Nadine. You know, I was
just thinking about you.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.031
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:44.064 --> 07:44.832
What was I wearing?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.500
Well, actually,
I didn't get that far, but...

07:46.534 --> 07:48.669
Well, that
sounds familiar.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.203
What are you
doing down here?

07:50.237 --> 07:51.138
Uh, Judge Trelane.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.040
Oh, you're investigating
his wife's murder.

07:53.073 --> 07:53.841
Oh, yeah, that's right.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.208
Actually, you're
in front of him

07:55.242 --> 07:56.109
for Duc Lu Phan,
aren't you?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.978
Yeah. I didn't think
he'd be able to get back

07:58.011 --> 07:59.446
to work so quickly.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.614
I guess he just
wants to do his job.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.615
What do you make
of all this?

08:01.649 --> 08:03.917
Could it have been Phan
who ordered the hit?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.418
- Yeah.
- Well, he's certainly

08:05.452 --> 08:06.920
violent enough.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.556
But I really hope
it wasn't him.

08:08.589 --> 08:09.757
Well, I didn't expect
to hear that

08:09.790 --> 08:11.625
from someone who's trying
to get him the death penalty.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.626
If Trelane thinks

08:12.660 --> 08:14.595
that Phan's responsible
for his wife's death,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.329
he's going to have
to recuse himself...

08:16.363 --> 08:17.330
If he can't render a decision,

08:17.364 --> 08:18.198
it's going to lead
to a mistrial.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.834
And a waste of about
seven months of my life--

08:20.868 --> 08:24.104
not that I've actually had
much of a life

08:24.137 --> 08:26.139
- the past seven months.
- Tell me about it.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.008
I think I know what you mean.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.845
So, I heard Terry Lake
transferred to Washington.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.747
Uh, yes, actually,
I guess

08:33.781 --> 08:36.684
she wants to give her marriage
a second shot.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.918
Have you had lunch yet?

08:37.951 --> 08:38.752
No, I haven't.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.153
- But, uh...
- Hey!

08:41.421 --> 08:42.756
CHARLIE:
Perfect timing.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.424
Hi. What are you doing here?

08:44.457 --> 08:45.425
I... Well,
what do you think?

08:45.458 --> 08:46.426
I'm here
looking for you, right?

08:46.459 --> 08:47.928
Can you give me
a ride home?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.096
- Yeah. I-I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.031
Nadine Hodges, this is
my brother Charlie.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.032
Oh, hey.

08:52.065 --> 08:52.833
Uh, I was at the DMV.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.501
They gave me
my learner's permit back again.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.335
Uh-oh.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.436
Again?!

08:56.469 --> 08:57.470
Yeah, I may
have mishandled

08:57.504 --> 08:59.139
my learner's permit
the first time around.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.074
Although I still take issue
with the methodology

09:01.108 --> 09:03.376
utilized in radar speed
detection. It is, uh...

09:03.410 --> 09:05.078
Did you get through
Trelane's files?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.880
- He's working with you on this?
- CHARLIE: Yeah.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.915
I think I'm onto something.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.316
All right.
I got to deal with this.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.383
How about
a rain check, okay?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.052
NADINE: Sure. All right?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.020
Sorry.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.857
Boy, I, uh... I could've
just taken the bus

09:16.890 --> 09:19.026
back to CalSci and
then went home.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.394
Yeah, well, you're
about 15 seconds too late

09:21.428 --> 09:22.395
with that thought.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.563
Sorry.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.666
( tires screeching )

09:32.272 --> 09:35.242
What kind of biker gang
doesn't ride Harleys?

09:35.275 --> 09:36.243
The urban kind.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.244
Besides,

09:37.277 --> 09:38.411
only investment bankers

09:38.445 --> 09:40.347
can afford
Harleys anymore.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.185
Why am I going to kill
the judge's wife?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.888
Well, even in jail, Danny
still calls the shots, right?

09:47.921 --> 09:50.057
The only way for you to sit
in the big chair over there

09:50.090 --> 09:52.392
is for Danny to go
out of the picture, right?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.393
This is a family.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.695
We don't do each
other like that.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.963
It's a family, huh?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.464
RAYMOND: You know what, bro?
We're done here.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.199
No, no, no, you got it
backward, Raymond.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.401
This conversation's over
when we walk out of here.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.170
Tell you what, man.
Why don't we run

10:03.203 --> 10:05.706
some of those serial numbers
against the hot sheets?

10:05.739 --> 10:06.707
This ain't right, yo!

10:08.809 --> 10:11.645
( engines roaring,
tires squealing )

10:17.417 --> 10:19.252
FBI!

10:19.286 --> 10:20.854
( deliberately ):
FBI!

10:20.888 --> 10:23.423
Back down or everybody
gets arrested!

10:23.456 --> 10:27.227
DAVID:
Federal agents! FBI!

10:28.929 --> 10:30.230
Let this go any
further, Raymond,

10:30.263 --> 10:33.633
and everybody in here is going
to end up with bullet holes.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.302
Now, I know I
have better places

10:35.335 --> 10:36.236
to be tonight than the hospital.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.038
You got no warrant,
you come in here on my treaty,

10:38.071 --> 10:39.773
and you want to step to me
like that?!

10:39.807 --> 10:42.575
And we'll leave the same way, if
you give us a choice!

10:42.609 --> 10:47.347
Anybody shows his gun,
we do not have a choice.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.124
( speaking Vietnamese )

11:05.699 --> 11:07.701
Let him go.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.043
Yo?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.713
Danny thinks

11:19.747 --> 11:20.881
you did it, Raymond.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.349
He pointed us
in your direction

11:22.382 --> 11:24.885
to send you
a clear message.

11:26.720 --> 11:32.125
The message is:
cooperate.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.393
Understand?

11:33.426 --> 11:37.397
Cooperate.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.665
COLBY: Look, David, I get that

11:38.698 --> 11:39.733
you're senior agent, okay?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.501
But you could've backed
my play in there.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.402
Man, it was a bad play.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.472
You can't sell wolf tickets
to hard-core bangers.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.306
"Wolf tickets"?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.708
Granger, a badge
isn't a magic wand, okay?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.277
You try to arrest
people without cause,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.012
you back them into
a corner, guess what?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.713
They're gonna fight you.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.115
( motorcycle revving )

12:00.553 --> 12:03.256
You say her
name is Hodges?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.224
Yeah. Nadine.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.226
She seemed pretty interested
in him, too,

12:06.259 --> 12:08.695
although I'm not really good at
reading those kinds of signals.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.729
No, you're not.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.899
You know that term
"dark matter"?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.834
That has always perplexed me.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.537
It fallaciously implies
that the 95% of our universe

12:17.570 --> 12:19.439
that can't be observed

12:19.472 --> 12:20.874
is some amorphous,

12:20.908 --> 12:24.011
eventless, just, uh, emptiness.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.413
I'm sorry?

12:26.446 --> 12:27.747
I suppose it's all too human.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.050
Instead of just admitting
to the present limits

12:30.083 --> 12:34.654
of our knowledge, we simply
declare things to be unknowable.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.123
ALAN:
This somehow relates

12:36.156 --> 12:37.124
to dating?

12:37.157 --> 12:38.591
I'm sorry;
to reading signals.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.692
Oh.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.530
And, of course,
to Rhonda Pickford.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.232
AMITA:
I'm not familiar

12:45.265 --> 12:46.366
with her work.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.768
She had a crush on me

12:48.802 --> 12:50.403
in fifth grade.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.005
- Oh.
- And, of course,

12:52.039 --> 12:56.009
girls in fifth grade
suddenly became 95% unknowable.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.978
( chuckles )
Isn't that the truth.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.279
- I'm not following.
- LARRY: Oh, well...

12:59.312 --> 13:02.782
you see, I labeled her
to be dark matter,

13:02.816 --> 13:04.017
and I just moved on

13:04.051 --> 13:06.086
to more accessible pursuits.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.054
Like, uh...

13:07.087 --> 13:09.422
( chuckling ):
...Space Invaders, actually.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.728
So what happened to this,
um, uh... Rhonda?

13:15.762 --> 13:19.066
Oh. She became
a professional cheerleader.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.534
ALAN: Really? She did.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.503
Yes, she did.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.671
ALAN:
I doubt that Don

13:24.704 --> 13:28.408
actually views women
as dark matter.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.609
Well, she's a prosecutor.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.111
I'm sure he'll see her again.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.412
Actually, Don thinks
there's a chance

13:32.445 --> 13:34.547
the man she's prosecuting may be
behind the murder

13:34.581 --> 13:35.482
of the judge's wife.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.517
You know something?

13:37.550 --> 13:38.651
Under that reasoning,

13:38.685 --> 13:40.620
wouldn't that
make this prosecutor

13:40.653 --> 13:43.456
just as likely a target?

13:45.092 --> 13:46.359
DAVID:
Raymond Hmong has the motive.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.896
He's the number two, but I
don't think he has the nerve.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.264
Yeah, well, Danny Phan's
got the nerve for sure,

13:51.298 --> 13:52.299
but no motive.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.402
Problem is Colby-- he really
pushed Raymond's buttons

13:55.435 --> 13:56.503
out there, you know?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.605
Okay, so?

13:58.638 --> 14:00.373
Look, just keep
an eye on the JFM.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.409
( sighs ) If we pick up that
Hmong's making a move,

14:02.442 --> 14:04.344
- then we hit them, okay?
- No problem.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.113
But this Colby, I mean,
I think he's running hot.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.480
Yeah, well,
before you say

14:07.514 --> 14:09.682
anything more,
he was just in here bitching

14:09.716 --> 14:10.783
about you, so...

14:10.817 --> 14:11.919
And what are wolf tickets?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.253
It's a bad bluff, you know?

14:13.286 --> 14:14.554
It's "The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

14:14.587 --> 14:15.889
Don, I'm just
trying to say

14:15.923 --> 14:17.424
Colby has
this Army mentality.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.126
You know, he thinks
everybody's a private

14:19.159 --> 14:20.127
who has to follow orders.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.029
Don, he goes in
too hard...

14:22.062 --> 14:24.564
You know, David, you were
the new guy last year,

14:24.597 --> 14:26.099
and you were too laid-back.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.068
Took you too long
to take initiative.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.102
And you got better;
you improved.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.470
- Yeah, I just thought...
- COLBY: Guys.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.138
Hey, I was just

14:31.171 --> 14:32.705
coming to get you--
Don wants us

14:32.739 --> 14:33.941
to check out
some gang intel.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.308
Yeah, well,
might not have to.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.210
I just ran Trelane's address
through LAPD dispatch database,

14:37.244 --> 14:39.279
see if there are any
prowler reports or anything.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.513
And?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.349
Look at this:
between May 2001

14:42.382 --> 14:43.483
and June 2003,

14:43.516 --> 14:46.686
LAPD responded to five
domestic disturbance calls

14:46.719 --> 14:47.887
at Trelane's residence.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.622
Apparently, they
had some knock-down,

14:49.656 --> 14:50.690
drag-outs.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.391
No criminal reports filed?

14:51.424 --> 14:53.526
DON: Yeah, well, guy's a federal
judge.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.494
No surprise there.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.162
No, but look:

14:55.195 --> 14:57.630
On two occasions,
Trelane was instructed

14:57.664 --> 14:58.798
to vacate the premises.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.433
DAVID: We've been assuming the
shooter

15:00.467 --> 15:03.470
was after the judge and
got the wife by mistake.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.538
Yeah. We might be
looking at this all wrong.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.345
Thing is,
you neglected to mention

15:12.379 --> 15:13.947
your history
of domestic disputes.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.516
Because that's what
it was-- history.

15:16.549 --> 15:20.020
You ever been unhappy
with your job, Agent Eppes?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.221
Yes, I have, sir.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.456
I'm talking about
a kind of unhappy that takes

15:23.490 --> 15:25.792
an hour of silence and three
drinks to come down from.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.728
Sitting in judgment
does not come naturally

15:28.761 --> 15:30.697
to a reasonable man.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.532
The drinking got worse,
and so did I.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.634
Well, we're talking
about violence here.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.935
I was never arrested.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.670
You're a federal judge.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.907
Even at my lowest point,
I never laid a hand on Alison.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.475
I was angry with myself,

15:42.509 --> 15:43.743
not with her.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.645
- She called the police.
- Yes.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.613
And she left me.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.048
But that was my wakeup call.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.649
I've been in the program
ever since.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.490
- When did she come back?
- Last August.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.429
Our last year together was
the happiest of our marriage.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.496
Look...

16:03.530 --> 16:05.498
knowing that she'd probably
still be alive,

16:05.532 --> 16:09.736
that coming back to me and
my work is what killed her...

16:13.773 --> 16:15.108
Do your job.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.544
Check my alibi,
my bank accounts,

16:17.577 --> 16:18.945
whatever you need...

16:18.978 --> 16:21.648
and then find the bastard
that killed my wife.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.019
CHARLIE:
So Bayes' theorem states

16:26.053 --> 16:28.421
that uncertainty,

16:28.455 --> 16:31.924
degrees of belief, can be
measured as probabilities.

16:31.958 --> 16:32.959
Charlie, do
you realize

16:32.992 --> 16:33.960
I spent two days

16:33.993 --> 16:35.462
putting these files in order?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.764
- Yeah, right.
- Uh, newest to oldest.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.232
Why did you do that?

16:39.266 --> 16:42.469
Because a criminal is much more
likely to act on his or her rage

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
right around the
time of conviction.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.439
You know, while the focus
is still sharp?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.674
Couldn't the opposite hold true?

16:47.707 --> 16:50.710
A grudge festering over time,
new developments

16:50.743 --> 16:51.944
aggravating it?

16:51.978 --> 16:53.913
It would depend upon
the personality

16:53.946 --> 16:55.615
and the situation.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.151
So, if time functions
differently on different people,

16:58.185 --> 17:01.054
then a chronological approach
would be no more effective

17:01.088 --> 17:02.622
than choosing a folder
at random.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.691
Okay, yeah, but you
have to start somewhere.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.725
No.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.060
You have to start everywhere.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.629
These are report cards, okay?

17:09.662 --> 17:13.533
But we're not looking for the
newest students, or the oldest.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.336
We're looking for the one with
the highest grade point average.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.905
With the grades being
for quantifiable behavior,

17:18.938 --> 17:21.241
such as the nature
of the crime,

17:21.274 --> 17:23.443
the severity of the sentence,
the potential for gain.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.179
Yeah, but this isn't just a
handful of A's and B's, Charlie.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.115
These are really raw

17:28.148 --> 17:30.817
human motivations,
like rage and revenge.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.652
Origami.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.187
( groans )

17:34.221 --> 17:38.791
In origami,
there are six basic folds:

17:38.825 --> 17:40.660
mountain,

17:40.693 --> 17:42.929
valley, diagonal,

17:42.962 --> 17:44.664
fold and unfold;

17:44.697 --> 17:46.366
reverse, and turnover.

17:46.399 --> 17:51.037
Each fold is a simple, finite,
imminently-quantifiable action.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.873
But the infinite number
of combinations

17:53.906 --> 17:55.875
creates the possibility

17:55.908 --> 17:57.810
for an infinite number of forms.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.479
Decision theory contends

17:59.512 --> 18:01.914
that we should use
the same basic criteria

18:01.948 --> 18:04.184
with every action we take.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.988
Risk, reward,

18:09.021 --> 18:11.858
consequence,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.393
and certainty.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.727
Human behavior is
not that rational.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.296
( chuckles )

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
Well, that's why my system

18:18.331 --> 18:21.301
is not meant to be a replacement
for your skills.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.770
It's simply a tool...

18:23.803 --> 18:27.006
to help you use them...

18:27.039 --> 18:29.709
much more efficiently.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.079
( laughs gently )

18:33.112 --> 18:34.781
( phone rings )

18:34.814 --> 18:37.584
That's good.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.751
Reeves.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.188
Megan, it's David.
We just heard from an informant.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.790
The JFM might take another shot
at the judge.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.657
MEGAN:
Does Don know?

18:44.691 --> 18:47.194
DAVID:
He's at the courthouse now.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.295
- What's up?
- Hey.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.864
We just got a tip that JFM
are looking for payback.

18:51.898 --> 18:52.999
That could be Raymond Hmong

18:53.032 --> 18:54.634
just talking big
for his gang members.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.736
Well, given the timing, we're
taking the threat seriously.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.638
The marshals are going
to put on additional men.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.107
We're gonna have a second metal
detector out there, all right?

19:01.140 --> 19:02.309
- Does Trelane know about it?
- Yeah.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.577
He's a brave man; he didn't let
on in court today.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.679
Well, he wants everything
as discreet as possible,

19:06.713 --> 19:08.448
so I'm going to
supervise, all right?

19:08.481 --> 19:11.351
So we're going to be seeing
a lot more of each other.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.752
Yeah.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.388
The marshals will give
you 24-hour protection.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.890
Just make sure they have a copy
of your schedule, okay?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.392
You hear me?

19:19.426 --> 19:21.794
Sure.
I'll get right on that.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.801
( agents yelling )

19:28.835 --> 19:30.437
Get down!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.873
Get down!
Get down! You!

19:40.880 --> 19:42.449
( indistinct conversation )

19:50.056 --> 19:50.757
Get down! Get down!

19:55.027 --> 19:57.397
( tires screeching )

20:04.737 --> 20:07.106
Don't do it, don't do it!
Don't move!

20:07.139 --> 20:09.809
Don't move-- I'll put two
bullets right in your back!

20:14.213 --> 20:17.350
Put your hands
behind your back, Raymond!

20:35.635 --> 20:36.603
DON:
So?

20:36.636 --> 20:39.706
Well, suddenly, Raymond here
doesn't have much to say.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.875
DON: You understand what you're
facing here, Raymond?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.911
Murder,
attempted murder.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.579
I didn't murder no one.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.080
Come on, you killed
Alison Trelane.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.450
What, you probably didn't
realize that she was borrowing

20:50.483 --> 20:51.918
her husband's car
that day, right?

20:51.951 --> 20:52.752
Then you went back
to finish

20:52.785 --> 20:54.587
what Danny Phan sent you
to do in the first place.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.889
I told you to cooperate,
remember that?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.058
I want to know how Phan arranged
for all this, you hear me?

20:59.091 --> 20:59.959
You testify against him

20:59.992 --> 21:02.261
and I'll see what I can do
about the wife's murder.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.730
I didn't kill nobody.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.400
Self-defense.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.702
DAVID:
Self-defense?!

21:09.736 --> 21:11.304
Trying to gun down
an unarmed judge?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.305
Is that what

21:12.339 --> 21:14.574
a JFM soldier calls
"self-defense"

21:14.607 --> 21:15.842
- these days?
- I wasn't aiming at no judge.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.879
That bullet was for Danny.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.549
That bro gave me up
to you, right?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.751
Ain't no way he gonna
do me like that.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.853
Not with him in there
and me out here.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.887
I'm gotta have

21:27.920 --> 21:30.357
my respect now,
you know what I'm saying?

21:32.525 --> 21:35.061
So Raymond Hmong
figures Danny Phan's

21:35.094 --> 21:36.829
trying to put the
murder off on him.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.298
Well, I mean, you know,
Hmong's DNA tested negative

21:39.332 --> 21:40.833
for the Trelane
crime scene, so,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.735
that's the thing,
he's not our guy.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.638
Well, on the bright
side, Trelane's free

21:45.672 --> 21:48.307
to sentence Phan without
having to recuse himself.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.842
Yeah, so you get
your case back

21:49.876 --> 21:52.945
and I'm at square one
with the wife's murder.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.447
So I guess
we're not going

21:54.481 --> 21:56.683
to be seeing much of
each other, after all.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.550
( sighs )

21:57.584 --> 22:00.587
You know, I had you
written off earlier.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.021
And then what
do you do,

22:02.054 --> 22:04.123
you go and you
save my life.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.191
Aw, don't write me off.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.126
I just get focused on the work.
You know.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.461
I don't know, Don.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.297
We always got along,

22:11.330 --> 22:13.500
timing never
seemed right.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.636
I just thought...

22:18.671 --> 22:19.506
Anyway.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.574
Good luck with the case.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.776
Nadine, I hope you realize
it's not about you.

22:23.810 --> 22:24.977
Oh, I know that.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.345
Good.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.015
Thank you. For today.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.883
And if you
figure out

22:30.917 --> 22:33.252
the rest...

22:33.285 --> 22:35.121
you could take your chances.

22:35.154 --> 22:38.124
Okay.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.492
Okay.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.797
( typing )
You know what?

22:44.831 --> 22:47.333
It's fun to be doing a
little combinatorics again.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.168
Combina-what?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.870
Combinatorics.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.639
It's a branch of
computer science.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.707
Mm. Amita's
not satisfied

22:54.741 --> 22:56.476
with just one
measly PhD.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.778
She's now moved on
to astrophysics.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.046
MEGAN ( chuckling ):
Well...

23:00.079 --> 23:02.582
a girl's got to have skills.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.917
And yet, somehow, we still
get stuck with the typing.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.153
Well, you're familiar
with the program.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.955
I'm not familiar
with the program.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.723
Oh, well, this is where
all the fun is, huh?

23:10.757 --> 23:11.924
- Professor Fleinhardt.
- Hi, Larry.

23:11.958 --> 23:12.725
This is Megan Reeves.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.893
She's working
with Don.

23:13.926 --> 23:14.827
- Uh, hi. Hi.
- Hi.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.929
I hope you don't mind, I'm...

23:16.963 --> 23:18.130
Oh, no, not at all.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.633
You realize all
your food is white?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.469
Mm, yes, I prefer white food.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.936
Why is that?

23:23.970 --> 23:24.837
Supersymmetry.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.038
It's a theory that
describes the nature

23:26.072 --> 23:29.341
of connectivity in complex
multidimensional space.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.243
You know,
symmetry is also

23:31.277 --> 23:32.912
a term we use
in behavioral science

23:32.945 --> 23:34.080
to explain obsessive

23:34.113 --> 23:35.247
behavior.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.916
Oh, is it now?

23:36.949 --> 23:39.118
I have a two-year-old
nephew who won't eat

23:39.151 --> 23:40.787
anything but pasta
with butter.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.354
We're a little
worried he might be

23:42.388 --> 23:44.156
a budding scientist.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.658
CHARLIE:
Larry has a tendency

23:45.692 --> 23:47.326
to live out his theories.

23:47.359 --> 23:49.095
MEGAN:
Oh.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.029
Amita, are you ready
to show us

23:50.062 --> 23:52.632
a 3-D scatterplot distribution
of all the relevant case?

23:52.665 --> 23:53.866
Sure.

23:56.002 --> 24:00.006
( beeping )

24:00.039 --> 24:01.774
It looks like a random
buckshot of points.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.110
Except for a small
number of cases

24:04.143 --> 24:05.878
that stand out.

24:09.816 --> 24:10.917
MEGAN:
Wow.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.419
That's a lot less files
than I originally gave you.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.221
Yeah, and we're
not even done yet.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.122
Amita...

24:16.155 --> 24:17.389
do you think

24:17.423 --> 24:19.191
you can filter the rest

24:19.225 --> 24:23.195
through something...
like this?

24:24.931 --> 24:26.733
It looks kind of like
decision theory.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.901
It's reverse
decision theory, actually.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.503
In decision theory,
options are evaluated

24:30.537 --> 24:32.404
by risk and reward.

24:32.438 --> 24:33.606
LARRY:
Corporations use it

24:33.640 --> 24:35.107
to weigh business plans,

24:35.141 --> 24:36.709
what products to develop,

24:36.743 --> 24:38.878
what companies
to do business with.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.980
Like a hunter
searching for food.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.415
He's constantly evaluating
his terrain,

24:43.449 --> 24:46.986
his available prey,
and rival predators...

24:47.019 --> 24:47.887
( growling )

24:47.920 --> 24:50.156
...weighing them against
his own appetite,

24:50.189 --> 24:51.791
his own strength, his needs,

24:51.824 --> 24:54.060
until he makes what he
considers an optimal decision.

24:54.093 --> 24:54.927
( gunshot )

24:54.961 --> 24:57.263
However, with reverse
decision theory...

24:57.296 --> 24:58.130
LARRY:
You take the optimal goal,

24:58.164 --> 25:00.466
- and you reverse the process.
- In other words,

25:00.499 --> 25:02.301
you start
with the final decision?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.270
The murder of
Alison Trelane.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.137
That's right.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.974
And then, determine which
predator is most likely--

25:08.007 --> 25:10.342
by inclination,
by opportunity--

25:10.376 --> 25:11.744
to have made that decision.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.416
( beeping )

25:17.449 --> 25:21.588
MEGAN: Charlie's work distilled
our suspects down to two.

25:21.621 --> 25:24.857
My lawyer didn't give me
adequate representation.

25:24.891 --> 25:28.427
I got stuck with an incompetent,
underpaid public defender.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.231
I'm completely innocent
of these charges.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.666
Number one is Orson Hardee.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.667
However... if I were

25:34.701 --> 25:36.569
to meet the guy
who killed that cop,

25:36.603 --> 25:41.741
I'd buy him a beer
for a job well done.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.142
( remote control beeps )

25:43.175 --> 25:45.144
All right, so Hardee's
a cop killer.

25:45.177 --> 25:45.645
He shot Detective

25:45.678 --> 25:47.714
Josh Kalen in a drug deal
in 1994.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.081
Trelane was the judge.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.618
The jury came back
in less than an hour.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.619
Since his conviction,

25:52.652 --> 25:53.953
he's become
a jailhouse attorney.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.454
He's filed 16 appeals,
all of them denied.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.056
Now he's gunning
for a new trial

25:57.089 --> 25:59.759
in front of Trelane,
and Trelane's not buying it.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.194
So, what, kill Trelane, he gets
a chance at another judge?

26:02.228 --> 26:02.962
Perhaps.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.297
Number two is Lance Dolan,
currently wanted

26:05.331 --> 26:06.432
on a bench warrant
for assault.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.466
LAPD believes

26:07.499 --> 26:08.935
he's still in the area.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.937
Well, I don't see
Trelane's name here.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.172
'Cause Lance Dolan has never
been to court

26:13.205 --> 26:13.272
with Judge Trelane.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.841
CHARLIE:
However...

26:14.874 --> 26:17.076
what's significant is
Lance Dolan was the only name

26:17.109 --> 26:19.679
that entered the data pool
through a Crimestopper tip.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.380
Oh, so you're saying
an informant says

26:21.413 --> 26:23.115
this guy killed Alison Trelane.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.784
Yes. And we're running
down that angle,

26:24.817 --> 26:26.819
but his psych profiles are
in line with this kind of act.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.255
But the only thing
that connects them is the tip?

26:29.288 --> 26:30.022
There are
only two cases

26:30.056 --> 26:32.892
that spiked extremely
high values in my analysis:

26:32.925 --> 26:36.528
Orson Hardee, Lance Dolan.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.632
Well, I mean,
I don't see a motive.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.300
Yeah, but, Don, what
if you had no motive,

26:41.333 --> 26:42.301
but you had, like,

26:42.334 --> 26:44.236
a... partial fingerprint?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.471
Follow the evidence.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.173
So what's the difference
between my math

26:47.206 --> 26:48.307
and a partial fingerprint?

26:48.340 --> 26:49.275
And, at this point,

26:49.308 --> 26:51.310
the Asian gang is a dead end.
( Don sighs )

26:51.343 --> 26:53.713
All right, well,
we'll see what David and Colby

26:53.746 --> 26:55.547
come up with about the tip,
but, meanwhile,

26:55.581 --> 26:57.817
we should be looking
at this guy.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.319
Hard.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.756
It was a drug deal
that went bad.

27:03.790 --> 27:07.326
Only when this animal, Hardee,
realized Josh was a cop,

27:07.359 --> 27:09.261
he just shot him.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.397
Just shot Josh in cold blood.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.332
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.934
Well, I'm very sorry.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.704
Have you heard from anyone
connected to Hardee?

27:17.737 --> 27:21.507
Phone calls, threatening
letters, anything like that?

27:21.540 --> 27:23.142
You think he's coming
after me now?

27:23.175 --> 27:25.778
He's not going anywhere,
but you've been very vocal

27:25.812 --> 27:27.079
about keeping him in prison,

27:27.113 --> 27:29.148
and we just would like
to take precautions.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.350
Right. I understand.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.351
( wry laugh )

27:32.384 --> 27:33.886
It never stops.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.122
Even with my husband's pension,

27:36.155 --> 27:39.325
I had to work two jobs
to keep this house.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.427
My daughter
ran away the day

27:41.460 --> 27:42.494
she turned 17.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.595
My son would be in jail

27:43.629 --> 27:46.098
if some of Josh's friends
on the force hadn't stepped in.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.334
People need to see
all of Hardee's crime,

27:48.367 --> 27:52.138
not just Josh's murder,
but what it cost his family.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.606
And you've been at all
the court dates, huh?

27:54.640 --> 27:55.808
Every hearing,

27:55.842 --> 27:59.411
every appeal, but, each time,
it gets a little harder.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.380
People don't want
to remember.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.481
They want to forget.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.317
Forget about what this man
did to Josh.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.855
But I won't let them.

28:13.325 --> 28:16.428
So Charlie tells me you
were shot at this afternoon.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.064
Huh? Again?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.031
Oh, yeah?

28:19.065 --> 28:20.499
Well, what Charlie
should've said was,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.134
it was more like...

28:22.168 --> 28:24.403
I was in the vicinity
of the shooting.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.437
Let's put it that way.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.139
He saved this prosecutor,

28:27.173 --> 28:29.675
and yet, he still won't
ask her out, for some reason.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.310
Really?
What's the problem?

28:31.343 --> 28:33.245
Yeah, she's hot, man.
She's perfect.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.914
- She's not perfect.
- She's interested in you.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.348
You said she was perfect.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.349
No, I didn't.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.517
So, now,
you date only women

28:38.550 --> 28:39.551
who have something wrong
with them?

28:39.585 --> 28:40.753
I'm not dating anyone.

28:40.787 --> 28:42.421
- So I noticed.
- Yeah, what's that about?

28:42.454 --> 28:46.325
Look, you know, with what I do,
relationships are,

28:46.358 --> 28:48.961
they're... they're just
not easy, okay?

28:48.995 --> 28:50.329
Would you just trust me?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.264
ALAN: Come on, Don, just because
something

28:52.298 --> 28:54.901
might go wrong doesn't mean
that you don't take a shot.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.969
You don't know what you're
talking about, okay?

28:57.003 --> 28:58.337
It's more complicated than that.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.240
Among other things, I... I don't
want to put anyone at risk.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.475
I don't want to be
a risk for someone.

29:03.509 --> 29:04.410
- You understand?
- ALAN: I see.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.244
Which means that police,

29:05.277 --> 29:08.214
and lawyers, and judges
shouldn't get married?

29:08.247 --> 29:09.515
Yeah, well,
look at Judge Trelane.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.017
Think I want to go through that?

29:11.050 --> 29:12.451
No, sir.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.561
Waitresses work
on tips, Hector.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.297
You are Hector Machado,
right?

29:26.432 --> 29:27.499
Maybe.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.536
We want to talk
about Lance Dolan

29:30.569 --> 29:31.804
and the Alison Trelane murder.

29:31.838 --> 29:32.872
How'd you find me?

29:32.905 --> 29:36.175
Actually, we know
quite a bit about you, Hector.

29:36.208 --> 29:38.044
Like how the LAPD says
you have a knack

29:38.077 --> 29:40.679
for getting thrown in jail
and hearing things.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.548
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:42.581 --> 29:43.649
Come on.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.617
So how about
a phone call

29:45.651 --> 29:49.055
you made to a Crimestopper
tip line?

29:49.088 --> 29:51.290
I thought that was supposed
to be confidential.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.560
From the public, Hector,
not from the FBI.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.595
You can't trust nobody no more.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.430
The name you gave:
Lance Dolan.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.665
What can you tell us?

29:59.698 --> 30:02.634
Where's my 25 G's?

30:02.668 --> 30:05.404
( pointedly ):
Where's Lance Dolan?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.907
Figures.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.476
( clears throat )
All right.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.511
I met the guy in a bar.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.546
He had that look,

30:14.580 --> 30:18.617
like someone who has something
to say, so I got him drunk.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.485
Out of the kindness

30:19.518 --> 30:21.353
of your heart, huh?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.689
Story comes on the TV

30:23.722 --> 30:26.425
about the judge's wife,
Dolan laughs,

30:26.458 --> 30:29.361
then he tells me there aren't
gonna be any arrests made,

30:29.395 --> 30:31.630
as long as he gets
some cash together,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.900
gets out of town.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.602
Being the good citizen
that I am...

30:36.635 --> 30:39.638
I called
the Crimestoppers line.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.639
Right.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.474
COLBY:
Guys, I just got back

30:42.508 --> 30:43.642
from the LAPD

30:43.675 --> 30:44.443
warrant squad.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.146
Turns out Lance Dolan's
got a girlfriend.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.281
Stacy Manning.
Arrests for burglary,

30:49.315 --> 30:50.482
stolen property--

30:50.516 --> 30:51.550
twice as his codefendant.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.352
Yeah? Where's she at?

30:53.385 --> 30:55.221
COLBY:
Venice.

30:55.254 --> 30:58.157
We have her under surveillance,
in case Dolan shows.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.829
See, that's the thing.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.997
We're basing all of this

31:05.031 --> 31:06.632
on the word
of a career informant.

31:06.665 --> 31:07.633
CHARLIE:
Well, no, it's not just

31:07.666 --> 31:08.800
based on the tip.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.169
It's also based on my analysis.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.370
Charlie, at some point,
I'm gonna have to explain

31:11.403 --> 31:13.672
why I've got four agents
chasing down Lance Dolan.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.840
And you know,
as far as I can tell,

31:14.873 --> 31:16.308
from this equation...

31:16.342 --> 31:16.943
Expression, Don.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.810
What-- expression, equation--

31:18.844 --> 31:20.179
you know, I don't understand

31:20.212 --> 31:21.680
why Dolan gets such
a high number.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.415
MEGAN: Well, there's the tip
itself,

31:23.449 --> 31:24.816
of course, and there's also
his record,

31:24.850 --> 31:26.052
and the psych profile.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.586
CHARLIE:
Sure, uh, but, um,

31:27.619 --> 31:29.588
there's also, um...

31:29.621 --> 31:30.489
What?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.024
Sometimes math finds something

31:32.058 --> 31:33.525
that we can't explain.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.027
And why Dolan

31:35.061 --> 31:36.528
is showing up as part
of this case,

31:36.562 --> 31:37.596
I can't fully explain.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.066
It's, uh... it's pi.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.334
Pi?

31:42.368 --> 31:44.736
The ratio of circumferance
to the diameter of a circle.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.738
Yeah, I know what pi is.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.174
Okay, but did you know that

31:48.207 --> 31:51.443
if you randomly drop needles
onto a sheet of lined paper,

31:51.477 --> 31:53.845
the probabilty that a needle
will cross a line

31:53.879 --> 31:55.982
relates directly to pi?

31:56.015 --> 31:57.683
It's call Buffon's needle.

31:57.716 --> 32:00.286
Pi appears
in quantum mechanics,

32:00.319 --> 32:01.988
relativity theory,
and number theory.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.990
But do you know why
pi would show up

32:04.023 --> 32:05.691
in all of these seemingly
unrelated places?

32:05.724 --> 32:07.293
Actually, I don't have a clue.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.660
Neither do I.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.262
No one does yet,
but, although

32:10.296 --> 32:13.565
we can't fully explain pi,
it keeps working.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.334
It keeps turning up.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.003
DON: So, you're saying that pi
is like something

32:17.036 --> 32:19.705
that connects Dolan
to Trelane, but we just can't

32:19.738 --> 32:20.939
figure it out yet.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.976
Lance Dolan's
bench warrant.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.512
Guess who he's wanted
for stabbing last year?

32:28.747 --> 32:30.482
Hector Machado.

32:30.516 --> 32:31.317
Oh, yeah.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.418
COLBY: Well, that could explain

32:32.451 --> 32:34.686
why Hector's so willing
to snitch on Dolan.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.088
Or set him up.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.956
All righty. Well...

32:44.930 --> 32:47.733
Pi.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.773
DAVID: When you gave up Lance
Dolan

32:54.806 --> 32:56.408
for Alison Trelane's murder,

32:56.442 --> 32:58.277
you left out a detail
or two, man.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.747
Yeah, like the fact
that he assaulted you last year.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.717
Lance and I did some business
together.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.119
There was a falling out.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.620
DAVID:
Falling out?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.989
The dude stabbed you, Hector.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.124
( laughs )

33:12.158 --> 33:13.325
COLBY:
Hector,

33:13.359 --> 33:15.861
how long did you think
it was gonna take us

33:15.894 --> 33:17.196
to figure that out?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.564
I wasn't really sure.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.066
Look, there's no
love lost between us,

33:20.099 --> 33:21.900
but one thing ain't got
nothing to do with the other.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.769
And you can check
the court records.

33:23.802 --> 33:24.970
Lance got busted
for stabbing me

33:25.003 --> 33:27.239
based on other witness accounts,
not mine.

33:27.273 --> 33:28.874
I never said word one
against him.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.409
Until now.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.578
Well, now, he's worth $25,000.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.613
( laughing )

33:36.148 --> 33:38.117
Hector could just be trying to
get revenge

33:38.150 --> 33:39.385
against the guy
who stabbed him.

33:39.418 --> 33:41.520
Or he could be telling
the truth.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.154
DON:
Hey, Megan,

33:42.188 --> 33:43.922
where are we
on Orson Hardee?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.657
I was just going over this
with Charlie.

33:45.691 --> 33:46.825
Hardee is a sociopath

33:46.858 --> 33:48.127
who brags about
killing a cop,

33:48.160 --> 33:49.295
and then won't admit it.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.763
He files legal documents
to prove his legal acumen...

33:51.797 --> 33:53.865
And if he put together the hit
on Trelane from prison...

33:53.899 --> 33:55.567
His intent would be
to let us know.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.335
Which brings us to Dolan.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.337
I mean, if we believe Hector,
but, I mean,

33:58.370 --> 34:00.339
as far as I can see,
Dolan's got no motive.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.308
Even though Dolan has
no apparent motivation,

34:02.341 --> 34:04.410
my analysis still
says he's a suspect.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.444
DAVID: Still no sign of Dolan

34:05.477 --> 34:06.978
at the girlfriend's
house, either.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.414
Look, we got
to find this guy already.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.048
Did you see if Hector
could help us on that?

34:10.082 --> 34:11.383
- We'll find out.
- Let's do it.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.719
And Charlie, will you just
go over this with me?

34:13.752 --> 34:15.121
Certainly.

34:15.154 --> 34:18.324
Hey, Larry,
what brings you here?

34:18.357 --> 34:20.359
Oh, I had some work to
go over with Charlie,

34:20.392 --> 34:22.994
but he couldn't get
away from here, so,

34:23.028 --> 34:25.397
the mountain comes,
yet again, to Mohammed.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.266
Oh, yeah? So, it's not
the coffee then, huh?

34:27.299 --> 34:29.501
Oh, oh, it is bitter.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.736
Splenda.

34:30.769 --> 34:34.306
Oh. Hey, Don, are you...

34:34.340 --> 34:37.042
are you familiar with, um,
quantum entanglement?

34:37.075 --> 34:39.445
Uh, I don't think so.
I'm not sure.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.948
Okay, it's a theory that holds
that photons come in pairs,

34:42.981 --> 34:45.351
that are separated
by space and time,

34:45.384 --> 34:50.689
but always in instantaneous,
inexplicable communication.

34:50.722 --> 34:54.793
Einstein calls it, uh,
"spooky action at a distance."

34:54.826 --> 34:56.328
But, you know, I find it...

34:56.362 --> 34:58.397
I find the notion
fairly romantic.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.465
How so?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.667
Well, uh, I mean,
we affect each other.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.603
Even when we don't mean to,
even when we don't want to,

35:04.636 --> 35:08.440
we're connected, you see, even
when we try to be unaffected.

35:08.474 --> 35:12.077
Why do I get the feeling you're
talking about my love life?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.413
Don, the universe
is accelerating at such a rate

35:14.446 --> 35:17.416
that, some day, eventually,
it will all fly apart,

35:17.449 --> 35:19.685
and all matter will just
drift alone

35:19.718 --> 35:21.220
and become disconnected.

35:21.253 --> 35:22.488
And how sad that would be

35:22.521 --> 35:25.191
if human beings were
to behave in a similar fashion.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.925
( stammering ):
And after

35:26.958 --> 35:29.395
considerable inner debate,
I find

35:29.428 --> 35:32.664
that the risks
of human contact are

35:32.698 --> 35:36.702
more than compensated for
by the rewards.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.405
I'll keep that in mind.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.040
That was not clear.

35:42.073 --> 35:43.709
( phone keypad beeping )

35:43.742 --> 35:44.943
COLBY:
You know this guy,

35:44.976 --> 35:46.312
right? So, this
should be easy.

35:46.345 --> 35:47.813
When she answers,
ask for him.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.048
Nothing fancy.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.049
( phone line ringing )

35:51.082 --> 35:53.185
Yeah?

35:53.219 --> 35:54.220
HECTOR:
Is this Stacy?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.654
STACY:
Who is this?

35:55.687 --> 35:57.756
Hector. I'm a friend
of Lance's.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.890
I need to talk to him.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.726
He's not here.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.228
Tell him

36:02.261 --> 36:05.231
I heard the Feds
are looking for him.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.332
STACY:
I don't know when I'll see him.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.567
Whatever. Just tell him
I called.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.069
Think I did
pretty good?

36:11.102 --> 36:14.840
( keypad beeping )

36:14.873 --> 36:16.107
( phone line ringing )

36:16.141 --> 36:17.643
She's making the call.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.346
LANCE:
What?

36:20.379 --> 36:22.214
The Feds are coming. I think
that guy Hector gave you up.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.482
- Now, why she assumes...
- Shh!

36:23.515 --> 36:24.950
Leave right now,
come pick me up.

36:24.983 --> 36:25.651
Okay.

36:29.087 --> 36:30.689
That's it.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.963
( engine revving )

36:39.831 --> 36:41.800
( tires squealing )

36:45.771 --> 36:48.340
( tires squealing )

36:52.711 --> 36:54.012
Hurry up.
Come on.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.982
( sirens blaring )

37:04.155 --> 37:05.891
Put your hands
on the dashboard!

37:05.924 --> 37:06.892
You hear me?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.594
Get 'em up, right now!

37:08.627 --> 37:09.461
Don't move.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.398
Don't move an inch.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.600
Get out of there.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.367
( grunts )

37:15.401 --> 37:16.968
Bring your hands
behind your back, thumbs up.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.043
Ah, looks like we found the gun
that killed Alison Trelane.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.177
Really.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.813
Go figure. Let's go.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.090
Who?

37:39.124 --> 37:41.660
Alison Trelane.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.429
We have DNA.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.830
We have your shotgun.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.400
Oh. And what kind
of deal do you have?

37:48.434 --> 37:49.701
Look, we don't need a deal,
Lance.

37:49.735 --> 37:52.270
MEGAN:
You killed a judge's wife.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.572
Can you think
of a defense attorney in town

37:53.605 --> 37:56.074
who's gonna want to wear
that bull's-eye on his back?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.409
I didn't know who she was.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.277
- Mrs. Trelane?
- I figured it was

37:59.311 --> 38:01.447
just some guy who wanted
to get rid of his wife.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.649
You're saying
Judge Trelane's involved?

38:05.717 --> 38:08.086
I should have
known better.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.056
Lance, what are
we talking about here?

38:11.089 --> 38:12.458
It was a
straight contract:

38:12.491 --> 38:14.826
5,000 down, 5,000 after.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.900
I just thought
it was some guy's wife.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.288
( auto-dial beeping )

38:43.321 --> 38:45.524
Charlie, I can't talk,
all right?

38:45.557 --> 38:47.325
We just picked up Lance Dolan.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.527
Oh, good, because

38:48.560 --> 38:51.497
I've reevaluated my analysis,
and what's significant is,

38:51.530 --> 38:54.533
the algorithm wasn't indicating
Dolan or Hardee.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.535
My math was connecting
the two cases.

38:56.568 --> 38:59.270
That's why Dolan spiked
in the first place.

38:59.304 --> 39:01.407
Don, these results
clearly indicate

39:01.440 --> 39:02.641
that there's
a common denominator.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.543
Something connects Dolan
to Hardee.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.777
Yeah, we know, Charlie.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.413
I'm looking at him right now,
okay?

39:07.446 --> 39:09.280
I'm gonna call you back.

39:09.314 --> 39:12.518
( over speaker ): They have
Lance Dolan talking next door.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.619
COLBY:
That's right.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.354
And the first name that
came out of his mouth

39:16.388 --> 39:17.756
was yours.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.558
Yeah, well,
we do have a history.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.259
Yeah, you do.
Alison Trelane.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.794
Contract killing
that you set up.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.396
I'm gonna give you

39:24.430 --> 39:26.665
five seconds to give me a name.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.434
Otherwise, I'm gonna go grab
Lance Dolan,

39:28.467 --> 39:30.001
and put him in here, and let the
two of you guys

39:30.035 --> 39:31.169
figure it out yourselves.

39:31.202 --> 39:31.903
( quietly scoffs )

39:31.937 --> 39:33.539
You think I'm selling
wolf tickets, man?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.074
Try me.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.876
You got nothing on me.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.678
I made an introduction.
That's all.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.880
DAVID:
You made an introduction

39:41.913 --> 39:44.516
to who, man?

39:44.550 --> 39:48.186
HECTOR: I don't owe anything to
Lance Dolan.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.955
I did to Josh Kalen.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.424
Josh Kalen?

39:53.559 --> 39:57.362
You mean Detective
Josh Kalen?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.464
The cop that Orson
Hardee murdered?

39:58.497 --> 40:00.031
Kalen took care of me

40:00.065 --> 40:01.299
for a lot of years.

40:01.332 --> 40:02.568
Treated me like a real person.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.035
COLBY: So, you kill Trelane's
wife after he sent

40:04.069 --> 40:05.471
his murderer to jail?
What...?

40:05.504 --> 40:07.272
I told you,
I introduced them.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.440
Anything happens after--

40:08.474 --> 40:09.741
that's got nothing
to do with me.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.409
Conspiracy law.
You could look that up.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.611
Who the hell
are you talking about,

40:12.644 --> 40:13.879
Hector?

40:16.582 --> 40:18.450
HECTOR:
I did everything I can.

40:18.484 --> 40:20.251
Kept out of this
as long as I could.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.588
Who?

40:23.822 --> 40:25.624
Agent Eppes?

40:25.657 --> 40:26.992
Mrs. Kalen, you're
gonna have to come with me.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.127
Bring your hands behind
your back, thumbs up, please.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.396
I don't suppose you could let me
put these away first.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.398
Hands behind your back.
I'm sorry, no.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.635
Ten years of trials
and appeals.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.637
Parole hearings.
My stomach in knots.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.639
Always wondering
if this was the time

40:40.672 --> 40:41.640
Orson Hardee would go free.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.642
Judge Trelane put the guy
in prison, ma'am.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.244
Trelane kept the man who
slaughtered my husband alive.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.879
The jury recommended
the death penalty.

40:47.913 --> 40:48.847
Did you know that?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.616
Only... Trelane
overruled them.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.351
With that one decision,
he destroyed my family.

40:53.384 --> 40:54.620
Hardee killed
your husband.

40:54.653 --> 40:58.089
But it was the judge's decision
that forced us to relive it.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.190
With every appeal,

40:59.224 --> 41:01.392
my children had to relive
their father's murder.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.128
And now Hardee wants
a new trial?

41:03.161 --> 41:05.497
I just... I couldn't put them
through that again.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.065
Why the judge's wife?

41:07.098 --> 41:09.601
So Trelane would know
what it's like to lose someone.

41:09.635 --> 41:10.769
So maybe he'd think twice

41:10.802 --> 41:13.138
about the next killer
he goes easy on.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.173
Watch your head, please.

41:23.414 --> 41:25.684
"Goes easy on"?!

41:25.717 --> 41:28.053
I tortured myself
over that decision.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.255
I wanted to help her.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.690
Give her closure.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.491
Yeah, it's just
that Hector Machado was one

41:33.525 --> 41:34.893
of her husband's informants.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.963
I think she got his name out
of one of his old snitch books.

41:37.996 --> 41:42.568
I had a responsibility
to the law.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.604
I hope you know
her death is not your fault.

41:45.637 --> 41:49.107
Eventually,
I might believe that.

41:49.140 --> 41:51.209
I don't think I could ever
stop blaming myself

41:51.242 --> 41:52.678
for all the time I wasted

41:52.711 --> 41:55.113
being drunk, angry,

41:55.146 --> 41:57.683
busy, when I really wasn't.

41:59.718 --> 42:02.588
In spite of everything, I...

42:02.621 --> 42:05.056
I still love my job.

42:05.090 --> 42:08.794
I just should have loved
my life a little more.

42:12.698 --> 42:16.602
ALAN: Okay, Don, it's time to
eat.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.603
- Hey.
- You eat dinner yet?

42:17.636 --> 42:19.638
Lobster at the Oceanfront.
Charlie's buying.

42:19.671 --> 42:20.672
Let's go.
I'm driving.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.040
Yeah, well,
that's not an incentive.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.408
ALAN: Which is why I need a
witness.

42:23.441 --> 42:24.409
Insurance purposes,
you know?

42:24.442 --> 42:26.277
Nadine...

42:26.311 --> 42:27.245
this is my father
Alan, and, uh,

42:27.278 --> 42:28.379
Charlie you know, right?

42:28.413 --> 42:29.114
Charlie, good to see you again.

42:29.147 --> 42:29.715
How you doing?

42:29.748 --> 42:30.749
I need to grab something

42:30.782 --> 42:32.718
out of my car.
Can I just meet you out there?

42:32.751 --> 42:34.519
- I'll be two seconds.
- All right.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.221
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.388
Good seeing you again.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.556
ALAN:
Wow, she is one

42:38.590 --> 42:40.225
hot-looking prosecutor.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.392
All right,
easy there, Pop.

42:41.426 --> 42:42.594
I know I'm
your father,

42:42.628 --> 42:43.662
but she's still one hot-looking
prosecutor.

42:43.695 --> 42:44.763
DON: I'm trying to figure out

42:44.796 --> 42:46.297
what to do about
Hector Machado.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.233
I mean, this guy might end up
collecting reward money

42:48.266 --> 42:50.435
for reporting a crime
that he probably arranged.

42:50.468 --> 42:51.903
So, it's a working dinner.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.706
Which explains the professional
working dinner cologne.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.341
I never ruled out
the possibility

42:56.374 --> 42:57.643
of some kind
of quantum entanglement.

42:57.676 --> 42:58.443
- Hmm ?
- That's not one of mine.
