’Pretty Little Liars” ”

00:03.500 --> 00:04.467
What're you doing?

00:04.470 --> 00:06.062
There's a footage on here
that proves

00:06.070 --> 00:07.264
that Noel's working
with Charlotte.

00:07.270 --> 00:08.931
— I'm pregnant.
— I'm here.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.396
Whatever you decide to do.

00:10.410 --> 00:13.004
I never wanna spend
another day without you

00:13.010 --> 00:14.159
ever, for the rest of my life.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.932
Can I kiss you,
just one last time?

00:15.950 --> 00:17.474
Just to say goodbye.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.571
Ali, you're really
vulnerable right now.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.409
Unbelievable.

00:23.420 --> 00:24.739
Nothing has changed, has it, Em?

00:24.750 --> 00:25.785

00:27.190 --> 00:29.351
'American aid worl_<ers
has been found alnve.‘

00:31.360 --> 00:33.157
Do you really think
we'd let you leave?

00:33.160 --> 00:35.651
You know too much.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.548
[grunting]

00:41.100 --> 00:42.294
[gunshot]

00:42.300 --> 00:45.201
I would never hurt you.
I'm your mother.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.929
[siren blaring]

00:47.940 --> 00:49.430
Mom?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.633
I'm not your mother,
but I'm gonna take care of you

00:50.650 --> 00:53.210
like I was.
What's your name?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.313
— Spencer.
— Okay, Spencer.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.776
You lost some blood,
I need you to stay awake

00:56.790 --> 00:58.815
until we can get you
topped off, okay?

00:58.820 --> 00:59.844
[sighs]
Okay.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.215
Tell me your last name, Spencer.

01:02.220 --> 01:03.949
What's your mom's name?

01:03.960 --> 01:06.554
'Who's your mom? Spencer?‘

01:07.700 --> 01:10.658
Come on.
Come on, Spencer. Come on.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.492
Someone should have stayed
with Spencer

01:14.500 --> 01:16.229
and kept Harry
from running away.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.662
Yeah, well it's too late
for that now.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.468
So it was Noel the whole time,
Noel and Jenna?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.971
All we know they were connected
to Charlotte and Rollins.

01:22.980 --> 01:24.504
Connected doesn't mean a motive.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.171
Maybe they thought we knew
too much about something.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.579
Where did Jenna go?

01:27.580 --> 01:29.377
You know, she probably
walked into a closet.

01:29.390 --> 01:33.349
Guys, if Noel was AD.
and Noel is dead, that means--

01:33.360 --> 01:35.112
— Don't say that out loud.
— It's what we're all thinkin'.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.556
No, I know, but just don't say
it out loud. Okay? Not yet.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.755
Watch out, folks,
coming through.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.489

(Aria)
'Toby? What happened to him?‘

01:45.030 --> 01:48.238
Oh, no. If Toby's here,
where's Yvonne?

01:49.840 --> 01:52.502
Got a secret
can you keep It?

01:52.510 --> 01:55.172
Swear this one you'll save

01:55.180 --> 01:57.501
Better lock it
in your pocket

01:57.510 --> 02:00.343
Taking this one to the grave

02:00.350 --> 02:02.511
If I show you
then I know you

02:02.520 --> 02:05.284
Won't tell what I said

02:05.290 --> 02:07.508
'Cause two can keep a secret

02:07.520 --> 02:10.489
If one of them is dead

02:12.960 --> 02:14.825
They call it
a medically induced coma.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.618
So, basically, she hasn't woken
up since she got out of surgery.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.396
It's gonna be okay.

02:22.270 --> 02:24.363
Spencer got shot?

02:24.370 --> 02:25.906
She's home now.

02:28.510 --> 02:29.738
Good.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.408
Tell her..

02:33.720 --> 02:35.415
Maybe you shouldn't
tell her anything.

02:35.420 --> 02:37.615
I don't want her to worry.

02:39.820 --> 02:42.812
[instrumental music]

03:08.980 --> 03:11.187
— Hey.
— Hi.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.563
Welcome home.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.195
[sighs]
Um..

03:30.210 --> 03:32.405
What's this?

03:35.840 --> 03:38.946
I didn't know
when you'd be back. I..

03:38.950 --> 03:40.941
I wasn't sure if I should stay.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.613
Right here waiting

03:48.620 --> 03:51.748
Where I'm meant to be

03:51.760 --> 03:55.218
There's nothing unbreakable

03:55.230 --> 03:59.360
This I know for sure

03:59.370 --> 04:02.339
What could be more than you?

04:02.340 --> 04:04.638
And what could be
more than me?

04:04.640 --> 04:08.428
Come to think..

04:10.210 --> 04:12.303
What's the big idea?

04:12.310 --> 04:14.676
I'm just making sure
that you're real.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.578
Hmm.

04:15.580 --> 04:19.914
Paint me in your mind..

04:23.160 --> 04:25.879
Do you have any plans
for the day?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.528
I have a few ideas.

04:27.530 --> 04:31.261
Or, we can use that energy
to track down Jenna.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.989
She's out there. I can feel it.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.639
I think that Grunwald is
starting to rub off on me.

04:37.970 --> 04:41.508
Well, I'm not gonna challenge
the logic in that.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.978
Noel's dead,
but Jenna's still out there.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.347
— I mean, we have to find her.
— We will.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.841
But I'm not taking
any chances with you.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.386
The last time _
I let you out of my srght

04:51.390 --> 04:53.540
I lost you down a rabbit hole.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.451
It was a hotel hole,
not a rabbit hole.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.054
It's time that Hanna
worry about Hanna.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.528
Oh I'm just
telling the truth..

05:08.540 --> 05:10.895
There was a time
when you wanted this so badly

05:10.910 --> 05:12.434
that it broke us up.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.200
I would never
let that happen again.

05:15.210 --> 05:16.905
I know, I know.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.849
But if you don't do this,
you're gonna regret it.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.473
So, let me worry about Jenna,
okay?

05:24.490 --> 05:26.742
Right here..

05:29.890 --> 05:33.849
A toast to welcome back
two more Rosewood graduates.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.250
Emily Fields, who will be
coaching our Varsity swim team

05:37.270 --> 05:41.331
and Paige McCullers, our new
athletic department supervisor.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.864
— Cheers. .
— 'Welcome.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.497
[indistinct chatter]

05:46.340 --> 05:48.228
Wow, I really thought

05:48.240 --> 05:49.798
it was gonna be
one of us or the other.

05:49.810 --> 05:52.370
— I guess we're both invaluable.
- Yeah.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.980
This is gonna be okay, right?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.447
Precise orders.

05:58.750 --> 06:02.049
Paige, I wanna talk to you
about some school committee.

06:02.060 --> 06:05.484
There are some choice positions
open at the moment.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.459
Hey. I texted you,
you never texted me back.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.257
Didn't have time.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.589
Oh, did you make an appointment?

06:11.600 --> 06:12.760
We'll go to
the doctors together.

06:12.770 --> 06:14.761
I've already been.
That's why I'm late.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.897
But, but I promised
I'd come with you.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.801
— You should have called me.
— It's my nightmare, not yours.

06:23.310 --> 06:27.201
So, how was it, the doctor?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.040
Humiliating.

06:29.050 --> 06:31.177
What did she tell you?

06:31.190 --> 06:34.114
That I was gonna have the baby
of a perfect stranger.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.689
What is she doing here?

06:38.690 --> 06:42.057
Paige? She's the new
athletic supervisor.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.522
Perfect!

06:45.800 --> 06:47.768
— Ali?
— I'm late.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.665
[indistinct chatter]

06:53.640 --> 06:57.030
Toby just got out of
the hospital, but Yvonne's..

06:57.050 --> 06:59.405
She's still unconscious.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.739
All the things that have
happened in this town

07:00.750 --> 07:03.617
and those two
get taken out by a deer.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.182
Was she hurt?

07:10.860 --> 07:12.020
Nicole?

07:14.360 --> 07:17.227
She broke a few bones
when she was abducted.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.391
They didn't heal properly

07:19.400 --> 07:23.029
so they have to break
and reset them.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.098
Oh.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.208
Where is she now?

07:28.210 --> 07:31.179
A recovery facility,
in New York, with her parents.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.549
I'm glad you could go.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.545
I tried to talk to her
on the flight

07:38.550 --> 07:40.643
but she wasn't ready.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.108
I can understand that.

[instrumental music]

07:49.260 --> 07:50.488
[cell phone beeps]

07:55.000 --> 07:57.298
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.505
It's just easier if I show you.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.477
[intense music]

08:09.590 --> 08:11.512
Read the tag.

08:17.260 --> 08:18.659
No.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.594
This is.. No!

08:22.600 --> 08:24.556
(Spencer)
'It was here when I got back
from the Lost Woods.‘

08:24.570 --> 08:25.628
That's when I called everybody.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.120
Guys, Noel's dead.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.190
Jenna is wandering around
in the dark. This can't be real.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.337
Noel's dead,
but somebody else is out there.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.035
Out there and just as crazy.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.270
You think Jenna and Noel
were working for somebody else?

08:37.280 --> 08:39.908
Or Jenna and Noel had
a twisted scheme all their own

08:39.920 --> 08:42.013
and we mistakenly assumed
that they were A.D.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.773
Sara said we were all looking
for the same thing.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.078
— What's_inside?
— We were waiting for you.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.524
Oh, golly,
you didn't have to do that.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.725
[music continues]

08:59.070 --> 09:01.288

Listen.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.164

'Wow.‘

09:05.510 --> 09:07.637

'Wow, indeed.‘

09:12.480 --> 09:13.902
Guys.

[music continues]

09:35.540 --> 09:36.996
[whirring]

09:37.010 --> 09:39.308
I still say
we throw it in the fireplace.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.905
Pour some brandy over it
and
f/ambe
the thing.

09:42.910 --> 09:45.640
Maybe this is something Noel
set up before the blind school.

09:45.650 --> 09:47.140
Noel couldn't have
come up With this.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.641
And Jenna wouldn't have been
able to build it.

09:49.650 --> 09:53.040
— Spencer, Mary Drake—-
— Mary Drake is a liar.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.187
My mom will prove that
when she gets home tomorrow.

09:55.190 --> 09:57.818
Since we are on a first name
ba5is With Detective Furey

09:57.830 --> 10:00.822
why don't we just
turn this thing over to him?

10:00.830 --> 10:02.388
Well, you know how that works.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.527
We turn this in to the police,
it'll blow up

10:04.530 --> 10:06.691
before you can get it
in the car.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.261
— He wants us to play him.
- No, Em.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.306
He wants to play with us.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.369
[music continues]

10:17.310 --> 10:19.744
[whirring]

10:22.020 --> 10:23.874
[speaking in foreign language]

10:25.320 --> 10:27.185
Endgame.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.750
It means that there's only
a few pieces left to play.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.057
Then it's all over.

10:32.430 --> 10:33.886
What do we do?

10:34.730 --> 10:37.028
[whirring]

10:37.030 --> 10:38.827
Right now, we don't do anything.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.736
Speaking of someone
who's been through an engagement

10:44.740 --> 10:45.934
you two are gonna be fine.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.032
You know what,
I don't feel fine.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.201
I feel like I need to throw up.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.178
[sighs]
And then this board game..

10:51.180 --> 10:53.899
[sighs]
This is too much.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.869
Aria..

10:55.880 --> 10:57.370
He tried to talk
to Nicole on the plane

10:57.390 --> 10:58.709
but he couldn't.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.347
Are you afraid he hasn't
told her about the book.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.056
I'm afraid that he hasn't
told her about us.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.358
Well, did Ezra say he wanted
to postpone the wedding?

11:07.560 --> 11:09.494
We didn't talk about it.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.559
So then proceed with plan A.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.094
Meaning what?

11:13.100 --> 11:15.568
Aria, you're gonna
plan this wedding

11:15.570 --> 11:16.889
and it's going to be
waiting for him

11:16.910 --> 11:18.605
while he says goodbye to Nicole.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.908
And trust me,
he will say goodbye to her.

11:20.910 --> 11:24.107
[instrumental music]

11:25.010 --> 11:26.807
[sighs]

11:26.820 --> 11:30.574
Athletic supervisor.
That's new.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.047
Did they invent that job
just for Paige?

11:34.190 --> 11:36.681
I don't think so.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.214
Did you ask the school
to hire her?

11:38.230 --> 11:41.757
No. They must have
wanted both of us.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.092
Lucky for everybody.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.127
[sighs]
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

11:48.140 --> 11:50.836
Depends on what you mean
by okay.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.934
Pregnant, stalked, broke, alone.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.306
I mean, if that's okay,
then I'm your girl.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.949
Ali, ou're not alone.
Y

11:58.950 --> 12:00.804
So, you think
I should tell the others?

12:00.820 --> 12:04.142
I wasn't talkin' about them.
I was talkin' about me.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.212
This isn't your problem.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.983
[sighs]

12:09.990 --> 12:12.527
Remember what I said
the other night?

12:12.530 --> 12:15.499
I support you,
whatever you decide.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.927
Look, it's late.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.209
I have to get up early
in the morning.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.438
Right.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.005
— Night.
— Goodnight.

12:37.650 --> 12:40.483
[indistinct chatter]

12:40.490 --> 12:42.651
Are you okay?

12:42.660 --> 12:44.981
— We're alive.
- Yeah.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.981
It's too bad about Noel.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.093
Well, no, not really.

12:54.470 --> 12:57.132
— May I?
— Go for it.

12:59.710 --> 13:02.178
[chuckles]

13:02.180 --> 13:04.671
(Mona)
'You were always
so good at this.‘

13:04.680 --> 13:06.602
Claudia was a jerk
for letting you go.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.542
Claudia was generally a jerk.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.017
[chuckles]
Are you gonna submit it

13:10.020 --> 13:12.386
to the Philadelphia
up—and-comer competition?

13:12.390 --> 13:14.881
No, I mean,
I'm no where near that level.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.415
Hanna,
you have a solid portfolio

13:17.430 --> 13:18.681
and I've seen your closet.

13:18.690 --> 13:20.385
So I have good designs.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.521
But who the hell is Hanna Marin?

13:23.530 --> 13:24.724
You dress the right person

13:24.730 --> 13:26.493
no one will ask
to see your resume.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.196
All you need is a body
with some marquee value.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.088
Yeah, well,
those don't grow on trees.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.906
What are you doing?

13:38.910 --> 13:41.276
I have a scathingly
brilliant idea.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.508
Don't leave town.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.511
That's what the police say
in all the movies.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.557
- Do you trust me?
— Sometimes.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.551
Make this one of those times.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.552
[instrumental music]

13:56.900 --> 13:59.892
— How's the arm?
— It's stiff.

13:59.900 --> 14:03.461
- You were luclq.
— Yeah, I guess so.

14:03.470 --> 14:04.994
Have you talked to Toby?

14:06.780 --> 14:08.202
No.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.344
I mean, the last thing
he needs is an old girlfriend

14:12.350 --> 14:13.442
complicating his life.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.109
[scoffs]

14:17.120 --> 14:18.109
Did you know that
Archer Dunhill was acquainted

14:18.120 --> 14:20.486
with Jenna Marshall
and Noel Kahn?

14:20.490 --> 14:22.412
No.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.253
They knew him when he was
pretending to be Dr. Rollins.

14:25.260 --> 14:28.423
We've checked
the visiting records.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.591
Do you still think
that he's out of the country?

14:32.570 --> 14:35.130
I'm starting to think
it's not Mr. Dunhill.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.602
[intense music]

14:46.850 --> 14:49.478
- You recognize this?
- Yeah.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.573
It's the gun that Jenna Marshall
shot me with.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.310
And you're certain that you saw
this gun in her hand.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.389
Yes.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.284
Why?

14:59.290 --> 15:02.794
Because this is a .45,
and you were shot with a .22.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.859
I saw the bullet
they took out of your shoulder.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.962
Are you saying that there were

15:05.970 --> 15:07.221
two people
who were shooting at me?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.798
No, I'm saying
there were two guns.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.495
One of which is still missing.

15:12.170 --> 15:15.333
Just like Jenna Marshall
and Mary Drake.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.331
[intense music]

15:23.320 --> 15:25.538
Toby still hasn't heard
from Spencer?

15:25.550 --> 15:28.314
No. I understand.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.151
I mean, I could barely even
talk to him without sounding

15:30.160 --> 15:32.185
like a stupid sympathy card.

15:32.190 --> 15:35.455
It's a lot more complicated
for Spencer.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.998
It's hard to imagine Spencer
at a loss for words.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.922
Would you know what to say?

15:44.210 --> 15:46.405
I think this is the best one
we've seen all day.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.571
And it's a one-stop shop.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.536
Linens, food, servers.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.506
Check the fine print?

15:53.520 --> 15:56.409
Can you at least pretend
to be excited? You're a bride.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.945
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Aria Montgomery is a bride?

15:58.950 --> 16:00.212
Holden?

16:00.220 --> 16:02.211
I walk in, I see you

16:02.220 --> 16:04.188
I almost had a heart attack.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.728
Oh, no, no, no,
I-I'm fine, I promise.

16:07.730 --> 16:10.255
- What's up, Hanna?
— Holden. Good to see you.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.465
[cell phone ringing]

16:12.470 --> 16:14.267
Oh, it's Mona,
I should take this.

16:14.270 --> 16:17.364
If I don't answer, she'll just
keep calling back. Sorry.

16:17.370 --> 16:20.237
— What are you even doing here?
— This is my sister's business.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.471
She needed a brilliant,
but affordable chef.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.572
You're a chef?

16:24.580 --> 16:28.209
Yeah, I try to cultivate
one new skill a year.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.814
So you're getting married?

16:30.820 --> 16:32.117
That's me.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.214
So who's the luclq guy?

16:35.220 --> 16:37.381
That would be Ezra.

16:37.390 --> 16:40.951
— No kidding.
— No kidding.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.497
And they say high school
romances don't last.

16:45.370 --> 16:46.394
Yeah.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.265
You deserve personal attention.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.830
Come on, I will give you
the nickel tour myself.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.102
Hmm.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.902
Mrs. Horowitz.

16:58.910 --> 17:01.799
Oh, you're on the faculty now,
Emily, you can call me May.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.173
I'll try.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.341
Uh, May, I noticed
you've Paige McCullers

17:05.350 --> 17:07.238
_and Alison DiLaurentis
in the same committee.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.750
Yeah, Paige stepped right up.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.809
Yeah, I-I'm not sure
that this is gonna be

17:11.830 --> 17:13.081
the most productive mix.

17:13.090 --> 17:14.489
Is there something
I should know?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.320
(Paige)
'Alison and I _
weren't exactly besties'

17:16.330 --> 17:18.252
'when we were students.‘

17:19.570 --> 17:22.733
Emily's afraid somebody
might be holding a grudge.

17:22.740 --> 17:25.538
But that was a long time ago.
And we're all adults now.

17:25.540 --> 17:29.476
— If there's a conflict..
— No conflict. Scout's honor.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.647
_ You see?
Nothing to worry about.

17:33.650 --> 17:34.674
[bell ringing]

17:34.680 --> 17:38.218
Well, pfft, off to the racers.

17:43.490 --> 17:45.355
I just didn't know
if it was a good idea.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.783
You don't have to protect me
from Ali.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.190
And if you thought you had
to protect Alison from me

17:51.200 --> 17:53.395
well,
you're not paying attention.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.165
You sure you don't mind
driving me home?

17:59.170 --> 18:02.571
Hanna said Mona demanded
a command performance.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.309
No problem.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.074
So what type of bride
do you envision yourself?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.310
Spring, autumn

18:09.320 --> 18:13.040
or a half-priced November
through March bride?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.484
Well, uh--

18:15.490 --> 18:17.481
It's okay,
let's find another way in.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.981
Were you going to have
the ceremony and reception

18:19.990 --> 18:22.527
at the same location?

18:22.530 --> 18:25.419
Yeah, that-that's a possibility.
We just..

18:25.430 --> 18:28.297
We haven't explored that yet.

18:29.700 --> 18:33.158
Hey, why don't I show you
the fountain?

18:33.170 --> 18:34.728
It seems to be the highlight
for most couples

18:34.740 --> 18:37.607
and you don't have to make
a choice about moving water.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.402
(Mona)
'Thank God,
where have you been?‘

18:41.420 --> 18:43.274
— Sorry, I—-
— Doesn't matter.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.215
Whatever happens, I need you
to be cool. Understand?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.614
Hey, can you not?

18:52.360 --> 18:56.023
Sorry, I had to take that.
It was dad.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.021
Senator daddy.

18:58.030 --> 18:59.691
You must be Hanna?

18:59.700 --> 19:03.898
Hanna, Katherine Daly.
Katherine, Hanna Marin.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.231
So your dad's Senator Daly.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.901
I voted for him.
I live in New York.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.435
Oh, remember to keep voting
for him when we go national.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.600
Katie, tell Hanna
what you were telling me.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.646
Well, I'm doing
a fundraiser for my dad

19:14.650 --> 19:17.278
and I'd love to wear
something new.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.612
Mona showed me some
of your de5igns on her phone.

19:20.620 --> 19:21.644
They're terrific.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.218
Well, you should come by
the studio.

19:23.220 --> 19:26.929
- Studio?
— Mm-hmm. Your studio.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.682
Oh, yeah, that studio.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.691
I have to make some calls,
but I can meet you later.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.919
— I'll text you the address.
— Perfect.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.794
— Two hours tops.
- Yeah.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.468
How do you know Katherine Daly?

19:38.470 --> 19:39.937
I do not know Katherine Daly.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.669
Katherine Daly knows me.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.671
Hanna, with your clothes
on her back

19:43.680 --> 19:46.308
you'll be in the "Sunday Times"
dial section before you know it.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.278
[both chuckling]

19:56.420 --> 19:58.285
— Spencer.
— 'Hi.'

19:58.290 --> 20:00.724
Oh, honey, hi.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.728
— Oh.
- Sorry, you're hurting me.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.960
— My shoulder.
— I'm sorry.

20:08.970 --> 20:10.858
I am just so happy to see you.

20:12.110 --> 20:13.338
Your father will be home soon.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.900
There was a problem
with the passport.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.798
He didn't want me to wait.

20:20.850 --> 20:22.579
Honey, what happened?

20:24.620 --> 20:27.544
Uh, Alison's husband
wasn't a real doctor.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.518
Turns out that he was a crook,
and he took all of her money.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.986
Noel Kahn kidnapped Hanna.

20:31.990 --> 20:33.787
She got away,
and Noel Kahn is now dead.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.529
Jenna Marshall shot me,
probably.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.293
Toby and Yvonne
were in a car crash.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.722
Do you want a glass of wine?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.831
I wanna know how you are.

20:45.110 --> 20:48.932
It's gonna depend a great deal
in the next few minutes.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.801
— Mary Drake.
— Where is she?

20:54.820 --> 20:57.345
She's temporarily
unaccounted for.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.584
What do you think she told me?

21:03.590 --> 21:06.718
Spencer, tell me what she said.
Now!

21:07.960 --> 21:09.393
Please.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.495
S-she, she said that you're not
my mother.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.559
My birth mother, that she is..

21:20.740 --> 21:22.207
Okay, now would be
the time to make

21:22.210 --> 21:23.507
a strong statement of denial.

21:23.510 --> 21:26.877
Mary Drake
is clinically insane!

21:26.880 --> 21:28.939
That's not a denial.

21:33.820 --> 21:37.608
I was sitting in this room,
working..

21:39.360 --> 21:41.555
...and Jessica
knocked on the door.

21:42.930 --> 21:47.128
I hadn't said five words to her
Since Jason was born.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.439
And there she was
like any neighbor

21:50.440 --> 21:53.409
come to borrow a lawnmower
or a husband.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.631
And she started telling me
that she had a sister

21:56.640 --> 22:00.747
a twin sister,
a sister I'd never heard of.

22:00.750 --> 22:06.211
And that's because she,
the sister had problems..

22:06.220 --> 22:08.916
[scoffs]
Emotional problems.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.911
She was in Radley.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.320
I didn't know why Jessica
was telling me all this.

22:14.330 --> 22:15.888
I didn't care

22:15.900 --> 22:19.597
uh, how many
unstable relatives she had.

22:20.670 --> 22:24.936
And then she told me
that Mary was pregnant.

22:24.940 --> 22:28.762
And I got this terrible
cold feeling in my stomach.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.340
She told me that it,
it happened before

22:31.350 --> 22:34.171
but this time they knew
who the father was.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.614
Because Mary told them.

22:36.620 --> 22:40.340
Apparently, your father
was in a restaurant

22:40.360 --> 22:43.318
when Jessica walked in

22:43.320 --> 22:45.788
or who he thought was Jessica.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.621
Dad did this to you.

22:53.630 --> 22:56.292
He did this to you again?

22:56.300 --> 22:58.962
Some people
have a great capacity

22:58.970 --> 23:00.631
for repeating mistakes.

23:01.810 --> 23:03.698
And you let him?

23:04.610 --> 23:06.077
You were a part of it?

23:06.080 --> 23:10.619
A crazy woman was going
to have a baby in-in Radley

23:10.620 --> 23:12.611
in a mental hospital.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.885
And the baby
would have been adopted.

23:15.890 --> 23:19.883
I, I couldn't stand
the thought of that baby..

23:19.890 --> 23:23.690
[sighs]
That child disappearing.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.897
Being swallowed up, forgotten.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.464
I spoke to Judge Kahn..

23:31.470 --> 23:34.200
...arrangements were made.

23:34.210 --> 23:37.407
And after all that..

23:37.410 --> 23:39.298
...you stayed with him.

23:39.310 --> 23:40.846
Yes.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.377
How could you do that?

23:44.390 --> 23:47.188
We'd made something.

23:47.190 --> 23:51.183
I know it wasn't what we thought
it would be or hoped it would be

23:51.190 --> 23:53.488
but it was ours.

23:53.490 --> 23:56.459
And there was Melissa,
and, and you.

24:01.700 --> 24:05.090
Were you there when I was born?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.668
Close by.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.160

[baby cooing]

24:23.390 --> 24:24.652
Hi.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.833
Five minutes.

24:36.770 --> 24:38.692
You were in this world
five minutes

24:38.710 --> 24:41.599
before I first held you.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.477
And I've been holding
on to you ever since.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.548
Yeah, but you're not my mother.

24:47.550 --> 24:49.370
I am your mother.
You know that.

24:49.380 --> 24:51.245
I don't know anything!

24:52.720 --> 24:55.211
Everything that I thought
I knew, everything

24:57.930 --> 25:00.057
Honey, Mary Drake
will never bother you again.

25:00.060 --> 25:02.085
I will make sure of that.
Your father and I--

25:02.100 --> 25:03.499
Please just stop.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.965
I was thinkin' about you
the other day.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.701
Thinkin' about our days sneakin'
around like a couple of spies.

25:17.580 --> 25:18.729
Thought I might give you a call

25:18.750 --> 25:22.106
then just like that,
I see you on TV.

25:23.850 --> 25:26.978
— 'How are you?‘
— Ezra.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.914
— Hey.
— You remember Holden.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.649
Hey, it's great
to see you again.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.379
Hey, yeah. Good to see you too.
Um, sorry, I need to..

25:34.400 --> 25:37.289
— I need to go to New York.
— Why, is something wrong?

25:37.300 --> 25:40.963
Um, Nicole's parents called me,
and they want me back up there.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.369
- Sure.
— But I, I won't be long.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.339
— Great. Okay.
— Uh, great seeing you.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.568
Same.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.540
— What?
— Who's Nicole?

26:00.250 --> 26:02.445
Why don't you try this one?

26:02.460 --> 26:05.020
Uh, it's gorgeous.

26:05.030 --> 26:08.727
My mother would kill me.
It's a bit bold for Georgetown.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.719
Um, look, Katie,
I would be thrilled

26:14.740 --> 26:16.662
if you wore one of my dresses.

26:16.670 --> 26:17.898
Absolutely.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.265
— Done.
— Terrific.

26:20.270 --> 26:23.706
Have the boss lady call me,
and we'll work out the details.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.632
— My boss?
— Mona.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.801
She has a real eye for talent.
You're so luclq she found you.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.640
— Right.
— Listen, I gotta go.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.072
But have Mona pick our top three

26:32.090 --> 26:34.911
and _I'll send someone
to pick them up later.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.889
And text me your Instagram
handle. I'll tag you.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.992
Did I hear that correctly?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.298
Well, I know what I heard.
What did you hear?

26:48.300 --> 26:49.892
Well, it sounded like
Mona was trying to

26:49.900 --> 26:52.698
push you off the label.
Whose idea was that?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.760
As I was saying,
I thought this could be

26:55.780 --> 26:58.340
an informal meeting,
no bad ideas.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.706
The way Mrs. Horowitz,
May, explained it to me

27:01.720 --> 27:03.039
we need to make it easier
for the parents

27:03.050 --> 27:04.574
to interact with the teachers.

27:04.590 --> 27:07.047
Emily and I were talking about
how we could use social media.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.688
I just wanna say
how great it is

27:08.690 --> 27:10.851
that Paige is really
pitching in on this.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.657
Really taking the lead.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.184
Thanks, Alison. So--

27:14.200 --> 27:16.953
Seriously though, it's such
a step forward for you.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.224
Usually people who are new,
they, I don't know

27:19.230 --> 27:21.164
go with something safer,
like a pep rally

27:21.170 --> 27:24.867
but you're really pushing
your personal comfort zone.

27:24.870 --> 27:28.362
— It's not that big a deal.
— Oh, don't be modest.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.429
Some of us here remember
what you used to be like.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.145
Don't we, Emily?

27:36.950 --> 27:40.511
I mean, May, you remember
when she was a student..

27:40.520 --> 27:43.284
...we always wondered where all
that aggression came from.

27:43.290 --> 27:46.054
'Stuff that made her
such a great competitor.‘

27:46.060 --> 27:49.894
I remember she had
a lot of team spirit.

27:49.900 --> 27:54.189
Yeah, but it was more
than that. Right, Emily?

27:54.200 --> 27:56.896
I bet Mrs. Horowitz remembers
how you were too, Alison.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.629
You're pretty unforgettable.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.108
— Thank you.
— It wasn't a compliment.

28:03.810 --> 28:06.449
Uh, how about we take
a five minute break, I think?

28:06.450 --> 28:08.907
Sure, if Paige thinks
she needs a break

28:08.920 --> 28:10.945
_ Iunderstand her
feeling a little overwhelmed.

28:10.950 --> 28:11.974
Stop it!

28:13.620 --> 28:17.488
Okay, um,
let's shelve this discussion

28:17.490 --> 28:20.425
'and move on to the bake sale.‘

[indistinct chatter on PA]

30:19.280 --> 30:21.498
— 'Hi.'
— Hey.

30:27.560 --> 30:28.584
[sighs]

30:37.160 --> 30:39.094
— I'm so sorry.
— I meant to call you.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.261
No, you didn't have to call me.

30:44.070 --> 30:47.233
I, uh, I talked to Marco.

30:47.240 --> 30:50.573
He told me what happened.
Are you, are you alright?

30:50.580 --> 30:52.571
Uh, yeah. I'm, I'm okay.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.841
Maybe this is finally over.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.983
Yeah, maybe.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.480
Toby, how is Yvonne?

31:10.600 --> 31:11.953
Not good.

31:14.100 --> 31:16.568
Is there anything that you need?

31:16.570 --> 31:19.960
Tried to make her leave with me
and this is what happens.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.268
Hey, you can't blame yourself,
okay?

31:22.280 --> 31:24.100
The world doesn't work
like that.

31:24.110 --> 31:26.476
Maybe not the rest of the world,
but this is Rosewood.

31:32.920 --> 31:37.459
Yeah, I keep on trying to tell
myself that this is just a town

31:37.460 --> 31:40.554
but_I can't make
a convmcmg argument.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.028
The evidence doesn't really
support the premise.

31:47.130 --> 31:50.497
Maybe this town has to disappear
before we can leave.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.364
Yeah, maybe.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.701
But we keep trying.

31:57.710 --> 32:01.202
So w_e'd beat on
boats against the current.

32:03.750 --> 32:07.208
We will get out of here.
We will.

32:07.220 --> 32:11.008
Yvonne will get better,
and we will all make our escape.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.223
[sighs]
I wish I could see that.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.519
You should probably try putting
on your glasses, old man.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.832
[chuckles]

32:32.850 --> 32:34.841
Yeah.

32:34.850 --> 32:36.670
Thank you so much for coming.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.683
[instrumental music]

32:45.360 --> 32:48.750
- You left in a hurry.
— I had things to do.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.024
— What was that all about?
— What was what about?

32:51.030 --> 32:52.258
We were in a teacher's lounge

32:52.270 --> 32:54.522
not the cafeteria
before homeroom.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.667
And what is it,
are you afraid of Paige

32:56.670 --> 32:58.535
or you just felt like
punching a familiar face?

32:58.540 --> 33:00.360
I take that you and Sabrina
are still on hold.

33:00.370 --> 33:02.861
See, this is the part of you
that I hate.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.609
When someone gets close,
it makes you itch.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.976
So you swap people away
like they are bugs.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.244
Please. Just go away.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.639
That's what you want me to do?

33:11.650 --> 33:13.447
God, Ali

33:13.450 --> 33:16.886
why do we have to keep
showing you that we love you?

33:16.890 --> 33:19.586
I keep getting mail addressed
to Elliott Rollins.

33:21.060 --> 33:25.224
Letters, packages.
That's what he left me with.

33:25.230 --> 33:28.927
Sports wear catalogues
and a baby.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.237
My life is a steaming hot mess.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.435
Everyone's life is a hot mess.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.635
Em, you and Paige

33:34.640 --> 33:37.700
you are not together now,
but you were.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.405
You have real memories.

33:39.410 --> 33:42.140
None of my memories are real.
They're all lies!

33:44.520 --> 33:45.544
[sighs]

33:47.720 --> 33:51.087
Ali, that other night
when you kissed me

33:51.090 --> 33:53.354
was that because you wanted to

33:53.360 --> 33:55.328
or because you didn't
want me to leave?

33:58.670 --> 34:00.126
I don't know.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.837
Please don't kiss me again.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.262
Not until you know.

34:06.270 --> 34:09.467
[instrumental music]

34:14.620 --> 34:16.576
Okay, so I just got off
the phone with Katherine

34:16.580 --> 34:19.117
and she was raving
about your dresses.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.781
You killed it, Han.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.519
[sighs]
I already have her
committed to wear

34:22.520 --> 34:24.283
one of your pieces to an event
and one of your pieces

34:24.290 --> 34:26.281
_while she's out
d0ing normal things.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.451
Not bad for a day's work.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.325
So when do you think
it'll be ready?

34:30.330 --> 34:32.525
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask my boss.

34:32.530 --> 34:35.192
Did you guys
go see your boss?

34:35.200 --> 34:38.294
We couldn't even get there
one day.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.904
Hit the brakes,
what's happening?

34:40.910 --> 34:42.764
Katherine thinks I work for you.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.805
Did you tell her
that this was your business?

34:44.810 --> 34:46.949
No. Never.

34:46.950 --> 34:49.646
It must be my natural aura
of authority and knowledge.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.709
Well, you can take your aura
and shove it right up--

34:51.720 --> 34:55.315
- You have it so wrong.
— I just want my life back.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.617
Okay. I wanna make
something beautiful.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.611
No more snarfing,
no more shovels.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.951
I mean, this is the first time
in my life when I thought that

35:00.960 --> 35:03.497
I was doing something important,
and then you have to--

35:03.500 --> 35:07.322
Whoa, I'm trying to
help your business grow.

35:07.330 --> 35:10.367
There is no other motive,
I promise.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.964
I was just excited for us
to finally work together.

35:12.970 --> 35:16.838
You know, on something other
than kidnapping my ex-boyfriend?

35:16.840 --> 35:18.376
Call Katherine.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.201
I will call her right now
and straighten her out.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.716
— And I want business cards.
— Fine.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.042
It'll say you're the boss
in gold-leaf embossed, I swear.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.688
Hi, Katie. Yes, all is well.

35:30.690 --> 35:33.557
But I just need to clear up
one small microscopic

40:14.340 --> 40:15.705
This does.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.302
We don't even know
if that's real.

40:17.310 --> 40:19.471
It goes with
what Spencer's mom said.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.745
Okay, I mean, Mrs. Hastings, 1..

40:22.750 --> 40:24.911
I mean, it just
keeps getting worse.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.549
— How is this even possible?
— I'm sorry.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.687
I wasn't thinking.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.585
Behaved like a bastard.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.656
Well, if the note really
did come out of that thing

40:38.670 --> 40:40.592
I say we get a crowbar
and see what else is in there.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.295
Its not a
p/nata,
Hanna.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.768
— It's a doomsday machine.
— It's about to be garbage.

40:44.770 --> 40:46.032
— Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Stop.

'That's us,
digging up Rollins.'

40:59.890 --> 41:02.711
'A.D. knows we killed him.'

[beeps]

41:06.430 --> 41:08.625
(Aria)
'What the hell does that mean?‘

41:31.120 --> 41:32.542
Thank you.

41:38.330 --> 41:40.150
You said you'd tell me today..

41:41.730 --> 41:43.220
...about the game.
