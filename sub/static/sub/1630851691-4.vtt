<i> We're all</i>

Yeah.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.378
Okay.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.321
These guys in my
intro to sosh class,

04:49.323 --> 04:50.388
They got this
hate on for me

04:50.457 --> 04:52.457
'cause I was out with
some of my roommates

04:52.459 --> 04:55.059
And one of them,
cora, she got wasted.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.527
And so the guys
were trying to
smash, you know,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.063
But I wasn't letting
that go down.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.998
So I got her
out of there.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.333
Guess I pissed
those guys off

05:01.468 --> 05:02.334
'cause next
thing I know,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.336
They start
messing with me.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.670
First it's
"memes" and "gifs"

05:05.739 --> 05:06.871
And on my
socials.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.473
Just
stupid stuff.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.907
Then they're
in my dms with-

05:09.943 --> 05:11.576
Did you tell the school?

05:11.578 --> 05:14.279
Taylor:
<i>It wasn't anything,</i>
<i>just dumb boy nonsense.</i>

05:14.281 --> 05:15.213
Then, though,

05:15.282 --> 05:16.615
When they're not getting
any play from me,

05:16.617 --> 05:18.916
They start sending me
snaps of random...

05:20.621 --> 05:21.953
Marcie:
<i>Random what?</i>

05:21.955 --> 05:24.022
Like junk.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.560
What'd you do then?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.563
I sent them snaps
of a bunch of asses

05:31.698 --> 05:33.631
With the caption,
"recognize yourself?"

05:34.468 --> 05:35.734
You did that?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.236
These boys think
they can get away
with anything,

05:38.372 --> 05:41.139
But they needed to
know that I wasn't
putting up with it.

05:42.810 --> 05:46.044
But then everything
started to get
really aggressive.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.480
They started sending
me texts that...

05:50.851 --> 05:53.351
They were making
rape jokes

05:53.354 --> 05:56.654
<i>Saying that next</i>
<i>time they try to</i>
<i>take cora home</i>

05:56.656 --> 05:57.955

05:59.460 --> 06:01.759
In my mouth to
keep me quiet.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.396
They sent me
some dick pics

06:04.465 --> 06:06.198
And they told me
to "take my pick".

06:06.333 --> 06:08.200
<i>Is this when you</i>
<i> complained to</i>
<i>the university?</i>

06:08.335 --> 06:12.204
Yeah, 'cause it
weirded me out and
it felt threatening.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.872
And I shouldn't have to
put up with this garbage

06:14.007 --> 06:17.075
'cause I stopped
those dumbasses from
raping my roommate.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.410
What happened when
you told the school?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.944
Taylor:
<i> Nothing.</i>

06:19.980 --> 06:21.613
Lowell,
ollie and denny,

06:21.682 --> 06:22.814
The guys,

06:22.816 --> 06:26.418
They were told to
apologize and stop
the behaviour.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.621
University said because
I sent them the snap

06:29.756 --> 06:32.657
<i>That it justified them thinking</i>
<i> that it was just jokes.</i>

06:33.761 --> 06:36.628
Yeah, sexual assault
is a real knee-slapper.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.962
Taylor, I'm-

06:38.031 --> 06:40.031
I'm really sorry that you had
to go through all of this.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.666
See, I thought that
would be that, you know?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.635
I really figured that
would end things.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.303
But then lowell
sent me a "supercut"

06:45.372 --> 06:47.171
Of all their dick
pics together.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.840
<i> And I had enough,</i>
<i> you know?</i>

06:48.876 --> 06:50.475
<i> I took the video</i>
<i> lowell sent me</i>

06:50.544 --> 06:53.177
And I added
meg thee stallion's "savage"

06:53.213 --> 06:55.213
And I added their
names and socials

06:55.348 --> 06:58.149
And I posted it to trasheap
via a non-traceable vpn.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.422
Nothing like a little meg,
but maybe not the best move.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.124
<i> Do you still have the</i>
<i> compilation on your laptop?</i>

07:06.193 --> 07:07.658
I deleted it.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.927
What about the
original video?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.462
I deleted it
from my phone.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.297
Okay, but it might
still be on your sd card.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.566
No. Here.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.502
I swapped this out of my phone

08:56.603 --> 08:57.502
Austin.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.104
Austin, that's right.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.107
So, what is the
other person doing

09:02.109 --> 09:04.042
When austin has
the talking stick?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.645
Listening.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.413
Listening. Yes, velma.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.383
I feel like I should
get a treat now.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.253
(giggling)

09:16.657 --> 09:17.889
Marcie:
I'm not letting
you near her

09:17.891 --> 09:19.591
Until you guarantee she'll
being treated like a minor.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.725
But she's not a minor.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.793
The youth criminal
justice act doesn't apply.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.195
And I got three pairs
of angry parents

09:24.197 --> 09:25.597
Who call me every
day crying about

09:25.666 --> 09:27.399
How their sons lives
have been impacted.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.467
And yet, they have no
problem prosecuting

09:29.503 --> 09:31.603
<i> My 19-year-old client</i>
<i> as a sex offender.</i>

09:31.672 --> 09:33.170
Sera:
<i> Not to mention the</i>
<i> possible ten year sentence</i>

09:33.206 --> 09:34.339
If she's found guilty.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.673
You have the
discretion to decide.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.808
<i> It's not just sexting, marcie.</i>

09:37.844 --> 09:40.011
<i> Your client took a</i>
<i> video of minors,</i>

09:40.047 --> 09:41.279
Set music to it,

09:41.348 --> 09:43.815
Added text and uploaded
it to a porn site.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.016
She made child pornography.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.017
You have no proof.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.685
(chuckles) oh, marcie.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.620
It's time to get a grasp

09:48.755 --> 09:50.288
On what exactly is
happening here.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.556
And what the hell
does that mean?

09:51.691 --> 09:52.690
It means don't
come bartering

09:52.726 --> 09:54.525
If you've got
nothing to offer.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.628
(phone chimes)

09:59.099 --> 10:03.401

10:03.437 --> 10:05.003
What happened?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.137
I'm sorry.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.305
I didn't know that-

10:07.440 --> 10:08.239
Marcie:
<i> Taylor, it's okay.</i>
<i> Don't apologize.</i>

10:08.275 --> 10:09.641
Just tell me
what's going on.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.542
They found out
about the charges.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.044
They told me that I'm
banned from campus

10:13.080 --> 10:14.879
<i> Until all of</i>
<i> this goes away.</i>

10:14.948 --> 10:15.913
Where did you get this?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.782
The director of
student affairs.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.916
<i> She handed me this</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:21.319
<i> And said the university</i>
<i> has a strict policy.</i>

10:21.321 --> 10:23.721
She said there
are "kids" here.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.390
<i> That I was a danger.</i>

10:25.525 --> 10:26.791
I asked her about
my scholarship,

10:26.793 --> 10:27.925
She said I could lose it.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.060
Marcie:
<i> This isn't right.</i>

10:29.195 --> 10:31.762
I'm not gonna let anyone
take anything away from you.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.467
I will figure this out.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.069

10:40.941 --> 10:42.740
Ed file" to
<i> help make that go away?</i>

10:42.876 --> 10:44.409
Reggie:
<i> Not that I wanna</i>
<i> waste it on this one.</i>

10:44.544 --> 10:46.610

out of the bag.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.613
<i> I think you've just got</i>
<i> to get her out from under</i>

10:48.682 --> 10:51.082
This double time before
the sex offender label

10:51.118 --> 10:52.684
Has an opportunity to stick.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.988
Are you able to help me out?

10:57.123 --> 10:58.490
Somebody try and stop me.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.525
I'm wondering if you can
run interference for me

11:00.594 --> 11:02.594
At the university on
behalf of taylor?

11:02.596 --> 11:04.028
Done.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.697
Legal aid's not gonna
have a problem?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.031
Don't worry about it.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.432
I got it.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.572
Owen:
<i> Marcie diggs?</i>

11:15.308 --> 11:16.708
<i> I'm owen clifton.</i>

11:16.777 --> 11:19.244
My son denny is one of the
boys your client doxxed.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.913
You mean one of the boys who
sexually harassed my client.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.815
Look, we're getting calls
from pedophiles at our house.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.583
They're-they're
leaving sick messages.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.984
My boy denny won't
even leave the house

11:27.020 --> 11:28.119
<i> Because he's</i>
<i> so embarrassed.</i>

11:28.155 --> 11:29.721
I hope you're not
looking for any sympathy.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.557
It was your client who put
this filth on trasheap.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.792
I think you need
to let go of me.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.127
Now!

11:36.696 --> 11:38.262
I'm sorry.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.131
We spoke to the crown about
having them taken down,

11:40.167 --> 11:42.934
But it doesn't seem like
much of a priority to her.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.936
And what does this
have to do with me?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.337
We've agreed,

11:46.339 --> 11:47.939
If you can have
them removed,

11:48.008 --> 11:49.974
We won't cooperate
with the crown.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.277
Sera creed can still
subpoena your son to testify.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.879
Owen:
<i> If you can make it so that</i>
<i> we don't have to worry</i>

11:55.014 --> 11:56.648
<i> About these photos</i>
<i> showing up online</i>

11:56.650 --> 11:58.550
When someone googles
my son's name,

11:58.685 --> 11:59.917
You have my
word that denny,

11:59.986 --> 12:01.553
And his friend oliver,

12:01.688 --> 12:03.888
Will not testify
against your client.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.923

12:07.094 --> 12:09.093
Helen:
<i> This is an ugly</i>
<i> criminal situation</i>

12:09.162 --> 12:11.162
<i> And it's important</i>
<i> that it be resolved</i>

12:11.164 --> 12:14.232
<i> Before we can consider having</i>
<i> taylor back on campus.</i>

12:14.367 --> 12:16.967
<i> This institution places the</i>
<i> well-being of its students</i>

12:17.003 --> 12:18.436
First and foremost.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.638
We have 17 year olds,

12:20.707 --> 12:24.775
In some cases 16 and 15 year
olds at this institution.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.978
We simply can't make
any exceptions.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.379
Reggie:
<i> Forgive my confusion</i>

12:28.381 --> 12:30.448
But where was this zero
tolerance approach

12:30.583 --> 12:32.784
When those three boys
were harassing taylor?

12:32.919 --> 12:34.319
Helen:
<i> I'm not sure how</i>
<i> familiar you are</i>

12:34.454 --> 12:36.187
With the situation,
mr. Thompson,

12:36.223 --> 12:38.990
But taylor wasn't really an
innocent in the entire matter.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.058
Are you serious?!

12:40.193 --> 12:42.293
Patricia:
<i> I think what</i>
<i> helen's saying is</i>

12:42.428 --> 12:45.463
Taylor's hands weren't
necessarily clean.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.931
Oh, this is the
school's version of

12:46.933 --> 12:49.334
"there are good people
on both sides".

12:49.469 --> 12:50.668
<i> Come on,</i>
<i> give me a break.</i>

12:50.670 --> 12:51.802
They were sending
her dick pics.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.003
Helen:
<i> Mr. Thompson,</i>

12:53.039 --> 12:54.672
These kids are a
different breed

12:54.674 --> 12:56.140
From when we
were coming up.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.543
<i> Nearly 45% of them</i>
<i> have traded nudes</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:00.545
By the time they
reach our doors.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.946
Imagine.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.549
It's impossible to
parse intention.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.819
The boys apologized and
everyone agreed to move on.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.358
Do you have a copy of
taylor's original complaint?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.062
Sure.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.396
I'll grab a copy.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.840

(tense music)

13:28.909 --> 13:29.908
(reggie sighs)

13:29.910 --> 13:31.509
So are you in court today?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.044
Just prepping for
a murder case.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.379
Hm. High profile.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.048
Mentally challenged
woman kills a new mother,

13:37.117 --> 13:39.050
Kidnaps her baby
thinking it's hers.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.518
Just another
pool of despair.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.453
Ohh, sounds uplifting.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.921
(chuckles) wanna talk
about uplifting,

13:43.957 --> 13:46.790
We should probably talk about
what's goin' on with you.

might be able to remove

about removing the video

14:04.143 --> 14:05.143
From trasheap,

14:05.145 --> 14:06.410
You've got to track
down all the people

14:06.446 --> 14:07.612
That downloaded the video

14:07.614 --> 14:09.681
And then uploaded
it to their sites.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.948
That's my question.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.685
I-I need somebody who really
understands this world.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.966
What about you?

17:49.002 --> 17:51.535
Reggie tells me that
you have staff now.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.769
Yeah.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.106
More responsibility,
less autonomy.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.107
How does that work?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.108
Well.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.076

18:15.662 --> 18:17.061
Her name was
viv and she-

18:18.832 --> 18:20.531
No, she didn't
seem mad at all.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.600
She just seemed
happy to help.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.905

19:01.508 --> 19:02.973
You said your client
wanted to talk.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.975
Yes but a little context.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.885
Does your client
want to talk to me

19:14.888 --> 19:16.987
Or am I only here
to enjoy the view?

19:17.056 --> 19:20.224
This doesn't need to be
that kind of talk, sera.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.158
Here's the deal.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.460
I only need one complainant.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.994
I've got that.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.729
I don't get it.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.431
You read the texts.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.967

19:32.805 --> 19:34.172
Taylor:
<i> What out about them?</i>

19:34.307 --> 19:36.407
You're not the least
bit sympathetic?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.076
God no, those boys are
a bunch of micro penises.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.745
<i> And if you repeat that,</i>
<i> I will deny it,</i>

19:41.814 --> 19:43.214

19:43.349 --> 19:47.218
And my job regardless of how
distasteful I may find it

19:47.287 --> 19:49.220
Is to prosecute people
who break the law.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.356
But my client is
the victim, sera.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.058
<i> Not those boys.</i>

19:54.127 --> 19:55.359

to send a message

19:55.494 --> 19:57.295

shouldn't fight back

19:57.297 --> 19:59.197

20:05.305 --> 20:07.038
I will agree to six months
in custody.

20:07.173 --> 20:08.639

20:08.641 --> 20:11.308

"and push back against it".

27:53.906 --> 27:55.505
What's in this for you?

27:56.775 --> 27:58.175
You don't trust
easily do you?

27:59.578 --> 28:00.510
No.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.579
Viv:
<i> Once corbin told</i>
<i> me who you were,</i>

28:02.581 --> 28:04.514
<i> I looked you up,</i>

28:04.583 --> 28:06.516
Heard about what
you're doing.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.251
It's bold, man.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.719
Removing one of
the main reasons

28:09.755 --> 28:12.055
So many of us end
up behind bars,

28:12.991 --> 28:15.225
Inadequate
legal representation.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.260
<i> I love it.</i>

28:17.296 --> 28:18.662
It gives me goosebumps.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.667
I want to help you hold
the system to account.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.069
What do you say?

28:26.138 --> 28:30.940
(inspiring music)

28:32.311 --> 28:33.811
Marcie:
<i> Taylor, I know you're upset</i>

28:33.813 --> 28:35.746
But just hear me out
before you make a decision

28:35.815 --> 28:37.147
On the crown's offer.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.750
Taylor:
<i> I just want this</i>
<i> over with, marcie.</i>

28:39.885 --> 28:42.386
I know but what
she's offering is-

28:42.521 --> 28:44.287
Taylor:
<i> Okay, fine.</i>
<i> I'll wait here.</i>

28:45.524 --> 28:47.891
Marcie:
<i> Just give me an hour.</i>
<i> I'll be there.</i>

28:47.927 --> 28:49.392
Okay?
<i> -Okay, bye.</i>

28:50.596 --> 28:51.895
This isn't our usual spot.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.030
<i> What's the occasion?</i>

28:53.165 --> 28:58.067
Well, I'm hoping to entice
you to come work with me.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.505
Don't you mean for you?

29:01.507 --> 29:03.807
Marcie:
<i> It'll have my name</i>
<i> on the door for now,</i>

29:03.809 --> 29:05.308
But, you know,

29:06.312 --> 29:09.112
As we grow I'm,
I'm open to change.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.616
Listen, I miss
working with you

29:13.652 --> 29:14.951
<i> And you know how</i>
<i> at legal aid</i>

29:14.987 --> 29:16.854
Everyone had
their own files?

29:16.856 --> 29:19.089
<i> Well, at the new firm,</i>

29:19.158 --> 29:22.059
We work all of our
cases together.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.594
There won't be your
case or my case.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.063
They'll be our cases.

29:27.666 --> 29:28.798
So, what's the money?

29:28.834 --> 29:29.733
Doug.

29:29.868 --> 29:30.834
<i> What?</i>

29:30.836 --> 29:32.802
I got bills just
like everyone else.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.806
And here I thought you
weren't about the money.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.182
How's that work?

29:52.892 --> 29:54.691
You had me at
"I miss working with you"

29:54.727 --> 29:57.694
But this certainly helps.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.362
(both chuckles)

29:59.398 --> 30:00.563
I guess lunch is on me.

30:00.699 --> 30:01.865
I guess so.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.735
(gentle upbeat music)

30:04.737 --> 30:07.504
(seagulls mew)

30:07.639 --> 30:09.039
Marcie.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.173
Dad.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.308
Did you suggest
to your mother

30:11.310 --> 30:13.777
We go see some minister
about our marriage?

30:13.779 --> 30:14.777
Ah, yes, I did dad.

30:14.814 --> 30:15.779
You know, she said that-

30:15.848 --> 30:17.381
Honey, I wish you would've
stayed out of it.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.748
Mom said the two of you

30:18.784 --> 30:20.450
Were having trouble
finding a therapist.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.752
We tried the therapy thing,
it didn't work.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.788
But for the first time in,

30:24.790 --> 30:26.923
I-don't-know-how-many-months,

30:26.959 --> 30:28.058
We had a coffee,

30:28.127 --> 30:29.259
We had a meal together.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.760
Real nice, marcie.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.396
<i> I feel like we've</i>
<i> turned a corner.</i>

30:33.465 --> 30:35.598
Sometimes all things
need to heal are time.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.402
But they don't heal dad,
do they?

30:41.106 --> 30:44.408
<i> They just scab over until</i>
<i> something hits you wrong</i>

30:44.543 --> 30:47.010
And then you find yourself
bleeding all over again.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.614
Look, I'm sorry that I jumped
in the middle of things,

30:51.650 --> 30:55.585
But if you two can't make it,
then we're all doomed.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.222
(phone chimes)

30:58.357 --> 30:59.690
I gotta go.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.358
I love you.

31:01.493 --> 31:07.430
(gentle rhythmic music)

31:07.499 --> 31:08.698
Marcie:
<i> I screwed up.</i>

31:08.734 --> 31:12.302
I thought if sera could just
see who she's prosecuting,

31:12.304 --> 31:13.236
That I could,

31:13.305 --> 31:14.237
I don't know.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.439
Just it backfired
spectacularly.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.974
We need to get
her back on side.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.976
Well I'm glad to see I'm not
the only one who stepped in it.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.444
I got a little
over aggressive

31:21.513 --> 31:23.380
With the
director of students lady

31:23.382 --> 31:25.649
And threatened to sue the
university into the ground

31:25.718 --> 31:27.251
If they didn't let
taylor come back.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.385
Oooh.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.986
See now that's the
reggie I know and love.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.121
(reggie chuckles)

31:34.860 --> 31:36.826
What if it's not
a threat though?

31:38.364 --> 31:40.997
They offered a safe
learning environment

31:41.133 --> 31:42.866
And she accepted that offer

31:42.868 --> 31:44.801
When she decided to
pay her tuition.

31:46.204 --> 31:49.406
I'm-I'm so sick and tired of
these people pushing her around.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.943
If they want to
be unreasonable,

31:53.078 --> 31:54.143
Then let's be unreasonable.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.278
Oooh, I like the
sound of that.

31:55.347 --> 31:56.413
(marcie chuckles)
(raised voices)

31:56.482 --> 31:58.081
Lowell:
<i> Why are you being</i>
<i> so difficult?</i>

31:58.216 --> 32:00.817
<i> You just need to plead</i>
<i> guilty and end all of this.</i>

32:00.953 --> 32:02.019
You're hurting all of us.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.019
It was just jokes.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.621
Why can't you be cool?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.090
Marcie:
<i> Hi, who are you?</i>

32:07.092 --> 32:07.958
This is lowell.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.359
(tense music)

32:09.361 --> 32:12.161
Okay. You need to go.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.296
Stop all of this.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.965
You're just being a
vindictive little bitch.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.100
Hey, you were
asked to leave.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.534
It was just jokes.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.371
It was just jokes?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.973
Threatening to rape me?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.040
To rape my friend?

32:24.076 --> 32:25.809
Those are jokes to you?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.444
Get the hell out of here, boy.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.544
You know what?

32:28.580 --> 32:30.981
If I have to,
I will go to jail.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.250
I will take the punishment
just so everyone knows

32:33.252 --> 32:35.551
What creeps you and your
little prez boys are.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.620
You're crazy.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.824
(tense dramatic music)

32:40.959 --> 32:43.994
(bicycle clicks away)

32:44.129 --> 32:45.795
I'm trusting you, marcie.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.663
I'm trusting you'll
do what you said.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.665
(tense music swells)

32:54.006 --> 32:55.205
We'll have to
confirm with taylor

32:55.207 --> 32:59.009
Whether she spoke to the
university before she sent the

32:59.011 --> 33:01.078
"recognize yourself" snap.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.412
You mean the ones
with the hairy bums?

33:02.547 --> 33:03.914
Marcie:
<i> Yes, that one.</i>

33:05.184 --> 33:06.482
Doug:
<i> Seventeen or eighteen</i>
<i> is the cut off</i>

33:06.518 --> 33:08.551
For something to be legally
considered child pornography.

33:08.553 --> 33:09.886
Under the age of eighteen.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.188
Huh.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.156
What a way to spend
your eighteenth birthday.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.492
What?

33:15.494 --> 33:16.492
Doug:
<i> The meeting on</i>
<i> taylor's complaint.</i>

33:16.628 --> 33:17.827
One of the boys, lowell.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.096
It was his
eighteenth birthday.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.741
You got something?

33:31.744 --> 33:35.312
The original video was
sent on February 15th.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.846
<i> All the boys were seventeen.</i>

33:36.915 --> 33:39.983
<i> But lowell's birthday</i>
<i> was on April 23rd.</i>

33:40.118 --> 33:41.718
The day of the hearing
at the university.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.120
But the original
"supercut" video that was,

33:44.189 --> 33:47.057
That was sent on may 27th.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.925
After he turned eighteen.

33:49.061 --> 33:53.996
And since he is the original
author of the "supercut"-

33:54.033 --> 33:56.332
He procured, created
and distributed

33:56.368 --> 33:57.467
Child pornography.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.702
And should be charged right
alongside your client.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.406
Looks like we're gonna
ruin sera's morning.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.389

<i> It must have been</i>
<i> quite the adjustment.</i>

34:33.472 --> 34:34.838
Not particularly.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.239
People are people, right?

34:37.810 --> 34:38.774
So the people in
the community

34:38.811 --> 34:40.510
Just welcomed you
with open arms?

34:41.313 --> 34:42.545
Pretty much.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.780
Pretty much, my eye.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.282
<i> Do you remember how</i>

<i> They used to</i>
<i> tear into you.</i>

34:52.824 --> 34:55.592
They were just
testing me, velma.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.061
Mad because I got the
prettiest girl up home.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.532
See how he is?

35:04.803 --> 35:06.602

work for you?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.079
Hey.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.280
Good morning.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.350
Why me?

35:20.352 --> 35:21.218
Ask her.

35:21.353 --> 35:22.619
No, honestly.

35:23.688 --> 35:24.888
Why me?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.558
Viv and I have been
together for eight months.

35:28.693 --> 35:29.992
What do I know?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.497
All I can say is vivian
develops fascinations

35:34.500 --> 35:36.166
And currently you
are one of them.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.434
Don't get used to it.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.103
But if she wanted to
invest in a law firm,

35:40.172 --> 35:42.772
Why wouldn't she just
set up her girlfriend?

35:42.808 --> 35:46.042
She doesn't like
mixing work and personal.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.378
So I shouldn't
offer you a job?

35:48.513 --> 35:49.913
Are you offering me one?

35:49.982 --> 35:51.280

37:29.547 --> 37:31.414
Reminds me of that little
place on the south shore

37:31.549 --> 37:32.882
We went to a
couple years ago.

37:32.884 --> 37:33.783
Remember?

37:33.918 --> 37:35.184
Gilligan's.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.220
I still think
about that fish.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.826
I'm glad you agreed to come
on this little date with me.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.627
Well just so you know,

37:44.630 --> 37:46.896
I'm not the kind of girl that
kisses on the first date.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.232
That's not my memory.

37:50.168 --> 37:52.001
(both laugh)

37:52.004 --> 37:53.302
Retta:
<i> Austin.</i>

37:54.205 --> 37:55.805
I know that ain't
austin diggs.

37:56.407 --> 37:57.774
Retta cole.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.575
What the hell are
you doing here?

37:59.577 --> 38:00.410
(retta laughs)

38:00.545 --> 38:01.544
Still husslin'.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.978
You know how it is.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.348
This is my wife, velma.

38:05.350 --> 38:06.449
Nice to meet you.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.252
So you're the one who
stole him from us.

38:09.387 --> 38:10.787
I can see why.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.889
Austin:
<i> I used to gig with retta and</i>
<i> her band back in the day.</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:14.357
Retta:
<i> Look, I'm about</i>
<i> to go back up.</i>

38:14.359 --> 38:15.925
You might as well come
and join me and the boys

38:16.061 --> 38:17.860
For a couple of songs.

38:17.896 --> 38:18.795
Listen, retta we're just-

38:18.930 --> 38:20.063
Ah, come on.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.664
You mean to tell me you
gonna break a lady's heart

38:21.700 --> 38:22.965
For a second time?

38:24.736 --> 38:26.236
Sure, go.

38:26.238 --> 38:27.536
I'm good.

38:27.572 --> 38:28.571
Just one.

38:28.573 --> 38:29.672
(upbeat music)

38:29.741 --> 38:31.674
I'll take it, come on.

38:31.743 --> 38:41.751
(upbeat music)

38:41.787 --> 39:05.642
(upbeat music)

39:05.777 --> 39:10.379
♪ ever since that day
you came into my life

39:10.415 --> 39:14.917
♪ I knew from the beginning
you were worth my time

39:14.953 --> 39:19.422
<i> ♪ I'm the perfect one for you,</i>

39:19.424 --> 39:21.524

39:35.206 --> 39:38.741
♪ I feel it baby every day ♪

39:40.312 --> 39:41.611
What are you doing?

39:41.680 --> 39:42.712
Me?

39:42.847 --> 39:43.779
You all up in
that woman's face

39:43.815 --> 39:45.415
Like a couple of
high school kids.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.750
(scoffs) it's just
a performance.

39:47.819 --> 39:48.918
Same as you and I do.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.154
I'm your wife, austin.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.423
But maybe you and
retta forgot that

39:53.558 --> 39:54.791
When you were gigging too.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.295
We were having
a nice lunch.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.564
Can we go back inside and
start over again? Please.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.365
I don't think so.

40:03.402 --> 40:04.333
No.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.335
You did your dirt, austin.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.804
And I let it go

40:07.939 --> 40:09.238
'cause you're a good man

40:09.240 --> 40:11.173
<i> And a good father.</i>

40:11.209 --> 40:12.308
But if I'm being honest,

40:12.377 --> 40:14.343
I don't trust you
have my back.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.678
What are you talk-

40:16.882 --> 40:19.549
Is this still about
that boy and the land?

40:19.551 --> 40:21.517
I just didn't agree.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.820
When you decided to
leave me with the girls.

40:23.889 --> 40:24.788
No no no, we-we-we decide-

40:24.923 --> 40:26.522
No, you decided!

40:26.658 --> 40:28.858
You figured you'd go off and
become the next stevie wonder.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.392
So you decided!

40:30.429 --> 40:33.696
And I went along 'cause
I've always got your back!

40:35.467 --> 40:37.200
Velma, I'm sorry.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.002
I've always had your back.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.471
When austin?

40:42.574 --> 40:44.340
When you were screwing
around on the road?

40:46.378 --> 40:48.878
Twenty years ago?
We're back there?

40:48.880 --> 40:49.779
<i> When you were</i>
<i> helping that boy</i>

40:49.914 --> 40:51.680
Try and take my
family's land.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.418
When you're grinnin' and
tee-heein' with the girls

40:55.420 --> 40:57.153
About how foolish I am.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.957
Tell me when you
have my back?

41:06.431 --> 41:07.630
I think I'm done.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.041
Marcie:
<i> They made the deal.</i>

41:18.176 --> 41:21.377
Yjc, acknowledgement,
no guilty plea,

41:21.446 --> 41:23.346
And six months probation.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.848
<i> Your record will be</i>
<i> sealed after that.</i>

41:24.983 --> 41:26.382
For real?

41:27.285 --> 41:29.218
<i> Thank you so much, marcie.</i>

41:30.254 --> 41:31.855
I can't believe this
is finally over.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.756
Ahh, not quite.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.995
We've reviewed your claim.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.729
<i> While we don't</i>
<i> necessarily agree</i>

41:40.765 --> 41:42.532
With your recounting
of the facts,

41:42.601 --> 41:45.601
We're willing to permit
ms. Dayal to return to class.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.103
Great.

41:47.105 --> 41:50.740
We just want to move on from
this whole sordid business.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.376
I'm sure taylor feels
exactly the same way.

41:54.613 --> 41:56.579
Ah, just one more thing.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.414
We're going to
need an apology.

42:04.456 --> 42:05.688
Yes. Okay.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.359
<i> Taylor we're</i>
<i> sorry for not-</i>

42:09.494 --> 42:10.593
Publicly.

42:11.829 --> 42:14.397
Perhaps a column in
the school newspaper.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.902
Well, better than her agreeing
to a sit down with cbc news.

42:21.006 --> 42:23.573
You know, so we can be
done with this whole

42:23.708 --> 42:25.575
Sordid business.

42:25.710 --> 42:29.478
(upbeat jazzy music)

42:29.514 --> 42:31.047
Reggie:
<i> The whole nut?</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:34.183
Salaries, admin, building.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.585
All of it.

42:35.587 --> 42:36.519
That's scary.

42:36.654 --> 42:37.787
(chuckles) we're
such lawyers.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.455
It does sound too
good to be true.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.790
I know, it does.

42:40.792 --> 42:43.592
But vivian seems
completely sincere.

42:43.628 --> 42:45.061
And in my experience,

42:45.130 --> 42:47.530
If something sounds
too good to be true.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.065
What, you don't believe
in philanthropy?

42:49.200 --> 42:50.600
Look at bill gates
and steve jobs.

42:50.735 --> 42:54.003
Sure. All I'm sayin' is
make sure you cross your "t's"

42:54.039 --> 42:56.205
<i> And dot your "I's" and</i>
<i> leave no room for surprise.</i>

42:56.207 --> 42:58.474
Nah, no such thing.

42:58.510 --> 43:00.809
Reggie, if I've
learned anything,

43:00.845 --> 43:03.145
It's be ready
for anything.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.947
Doug:
<i> To being ready</i>
<i> for anything.</i>

43:05.750 --> 43:07.149
(glasses clink)

43:07.218 --> 43:14.023
(upbeat music)
