<i>(genie)
MR. CASTLE.</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:39.895
IT VVAS MY SUGGESTION THAT YOU
REFLECT \/ERY CAREFULLY, MR. CASTLE.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.682
<i>VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.</i>

15:43.776 --> 15:49.237
NOVV, HAD YOU MADE A VVISH THAT TOOK
INTO ACCOUNT THE TAXES lN\/OL\/ED-

15:49.323 --> 15:51.314
OH. LOOK, YOU.

15:51.409 --> 15:54.071
PLENTY OF SVVEET TALK AND
PROMISES AND THE VVHOLE THING,

15:54.162 --> 15:57.746
AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE
NOTHING BUT A CONARTIST.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.824
THIS TIME I VVANT THE MILLION
DOLLARS, BUT I VVANT IT AFTER--

16:00.877 --> 16:03.494
ARTHUR! NO MORE MONEY.

16:03.546 --> 16:07.335
YOU GOTTA WISH
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.837
SOMETHING ELSE.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.339
HOW ABOUT TEN MORE
WISHES? OR TWENTY?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.091
<i>DON'T BE IN SUCH
A HURRY, ARTHUR.</i>

16:14.182 --> 16:16.264
THEN YOU THINK
OF SOMETHING!

16:16.350 --> 16:19.684
I'M AFRAID VVISHING FOR MORE VVISHES
ISN'T PERMITTED, MR. CASTLE.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.183
FRANKLY, I'D BE AFRAID TO HA\/E YOU
TRY FOR FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.764
WHAT CONSEQUENCES?

16:24.859 --> 16:27.226
WHY DO YOU KEEP
LOSING YOUR TEMPER?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.937
WELL, YOU'RE NO HELP
FOR ME. THAT'S FOR SURE!

16:30.031 --> 16:34.525

16:43.878 --> 16:47.872
WHA--WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH US?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.548
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:50.635 --> 16:55.300
ODDLY ENOUGH, MR. CASTLE, THIS IS THE NORMAL
PATTERN THAT SEEMS TO BE GENERALLY FOLLOVVED.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.767
<i>GREAT EXCITEMENT,
GREAT EMOTIONALISM.</i>

16:57.850 --> 17:02.060
STRANGELY ENOUGH, HARD TO
BELIEVE THOUGH IT MAY BE,

17:02.146 --> 17:04.478
ONLY A MODICUM
OF HAPPINESS.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.317
WELL,

17:09.403 --> 17:12.316
YOU GOT A COUPLE OF CHEAP
CUSTOMERS HERE, MISTER.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.818
PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T
KNOWN MUCH HAPPINESS.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.946
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT
DO WE WISH FOR?

17:19.038 --> 17:22.827
I WISH I KNEW, ARTHUR.
I DON'T KNOW!

17:22.916 --> 17:25.625
WHAT ABOUT IT, GENIE?
WHAT CAN WE WISH FOR NOW?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.667
WHA-WHAT CAN COME
TO US WITHOUT TRICKS?

17:27.755 --> 17:31.089
VVITHOUT TRICKS! I QUESTION THE
SEMANTICS HERE, MR. CASTLE.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.337
THERE ARE NO
TRICKS INVOLVED.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.965
THERE ARE SIMPLY NORMAL AND
UNDERSTANDABLE OUTGROVVTHS AND CONDITIONS

17:37.056 --> 17:39.172
THAT GO WITH
ANY WINDFALL.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.474
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU WISH FOR,

17:41.561 --> 17:44.553
YOU MUST BE PREPARED
FOR THE CONSEQUENCES.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.645
SOMETHING WITHOUT
CONSEQUENCES.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.696
SOMETHING <i>DEAD</i> SURE.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.947
SOMETHING ANCHORED,
SOMETHING AIRTIGHT.

18:02.957 --> 18:07.042
EDNA, I THINK
I GOT IT.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.711
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.788
WHAT, ARTHUR?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.965
POWER. POWER, EDNA.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.878
TO BE IN CHARGE
OF SOMETHING.

18:17.972 --> 18:21.806
THE BOSS.
TO BE A LEADER.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.808
WE COULD
WISH FOR THAT.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.226
<i>POSSIBLE.
VERY POSSIBLE.</i>

18:26.314 --> 18:30.023
PRESIDENT OF A CORPORATION?
THAT SORT OF THING?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.066
HE COULD GO BANKRUPT.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.860
MAYOR OF A CITY?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.358
YOU GET VOTED OUT
OF OFFICE. THEN WHAT?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.690
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.742
<i>I KNOW WHAT.</i>

18:41.829 --> 18:46.574

RULER OF A WHOLE COUNTRY.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.624
THAT'S IT.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.746
WHAT ABOUT IT, GENIE?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.003
I VVANNA BE THE HEAD OF A COUNTRY
VVHO CAN'T BE VOTED OUT OF OFFIOE.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.346
DO YOU WANT TO BE MORE
SPECIFIC THAN THAT?

18:58.429 --> 19:02.343
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.551
LET ME GIVE IT
TO YOU THIS WAY.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.763
I WANT TO BE THE HEAD

19:08.856 --> 19:10.722
WHO CAN'T BE VOTED
OUT OF OFFICE,

19:10.816 --> 19:13.524
BUT IT MUST BE A
CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.775
<i>CONTEMPORARY?</i>

19:14.862 --> 19:16.523
WITHIN THIS CENTURY.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.855

19:23.829 --> 19:26.366
CONSEQUENCES, MR. CASTLE?

19:45.059 --> 19:48.142
I WANT TO BE THE RULER
OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY,

19:48.229 --> 19:51.893
<i>JUST AS I'VE
DESCRIBED IT.</i>

19:51.982 --> 19:54.815
GO AHEAD, GENIE.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.823
I HAD A WISH FULFILLED.

22:11.914 --> 22:14.201

22:16.126 --> 22:19.710
ALL THE WISHES
ENDED THE SAME WAY.

22:19.797 --> 22:23.506
IN FRAGMENTS,
LITTLE PIECES.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.294
FUNNY THING, THOUGH.

OH, I'M FINE.

22:36.897 --> 22:41.767
WELL, MAYBE WE'LL STOP
WISHING FOR A WHILE.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.399
AND, SINCE VVE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T
AFFORD A BRAND-NEVV LIFE,

22:45.489 --> 22:49.073
