00:00.611 --> 00:02.615
Previously on
Political Animals...

00:02.742 --> 00:04.121
Susan Berg has a story.

00:04.186 --> 00:05.986
T.J. Hammond tried
to kill himself.

00:06.054 --> 00:07.755
You know,
working with Anne on the

00:07.823 --> 00:09.089
engagement party
has been a dream.

00:09.157 --> 00:10.524
We wanted 60 people at a club,

00:10.592 --> 00:12.493
and we're having 300 people
at the zoo

00:12.561 --> 00:15.029
because your mother
likes elephants.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.599
<i>There is no article that can</i>
<i>explain the complexities</i>

00:18.667 --> 00:20.034
of a single marriage.

00:20.101 --> 00:21.302
You don't make it easy
to love you.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.937
It's not supposed to be easy.

00:23.004 --> 00:24.305
Easy is Georgia.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.539
Easy is where you can spend
the night

00:25.607 --> 00:27.074
while I'm moving out.

00:27.142 --> 00:29.143
The Iranian court has found
the journalists guilty.

00:29.211 --> 00:31.312
President Hakam has set
their execution

00:31.379 --> 00:32.780
for 24 hours from now.

00:32.848 --> 00:34.615
I'd like to propose
to the president

00:34.683 --> 00:36.584
that he send you to Iran.

00:36.651 --> 00:37.985
Thought you'd never ask.

00:38.053 --> 00:39.186
You just wanted me

00:39.254 --> 00:41.622
to get Garcetti
to send you to Iran?

00:41.690 --> 00:42.890
I am the best person
to get those journalists back,

00:42.958 --> 00:44.091
and you know it.

00:44.159 --> 00:46.460
Can you keep a secret, Clark?

00:46.528 --> 00:48.863
I'm gonna run
for president again.

00:50.330 --> 00:54.834
Senator, there's a vote
tomorrow on the education bill,

00:54.901 --> 00:56.302
and a little shit-talking
bird told me

00:56.370 --> 00:58.404
your fat ass is out of town.

00:58.472 --> 01:00.172
Something about
the other side labeling it

01:00.240 --> 01:01.540
affirmative action.

01:01.808 --> 01:04.443
Now told 'em Don Strickland
may be one

01:04.510 --> 01:07.146
of the luckiest assholes
ever to have been sworn

01:07.214 --> 01:11.083
into congress, but that doesn't
mean he's a coward.

01:11.151 --> 01:14.620
Hang on, I'll finish the insult
for you, Senator.

01:14.688 --> 01:18.557
I'm a bastard. I'm a rotten
son of a bitch, right?

01:18.625 --> 01:20.359
I suck at tennis and bowling.

01:20.427 --> 01:22.328
Hell, there's about five things
I do well,

01:22.396 --> 01:23.896
and one of 'em is fart.

01:23.964 --> 01:27.266
Now this is history, and if
you're too chicken to be on

01:27.334 --> 01:29.869
the right side of it,
then I will drag your ass,

01:29.936 --> 01:32.672
kicking and screaming,
across the line

01:32.739 --> 01:34.473
and you can blow me
for it later.

01:34.541 --> 01:36.042
Now have nice evening, Don.

01:36.109 --> 01:38.411
Give Marjorie a kiss for me.

01:39.513 --> 01:40.746
Evening, sugar.

01:40.814 --> 01:42.581
Can we have a moment?

01:45.152 --> 01:46.786
What is it, baby?

01:46.853 --> 01:47.953
Sarah Latham.

01:48.021 --> 01:50.022
Who?
Don't bullshit me, Bud.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.590
Sarah Latham.

01:51.658 --> 01:55.628
Oh, the homely gal
from your advance team.

01:55.696 --> 01:57.196
The one that you fired
for the...

01:57.264 --> 01:58.464
Did you sleep with her?

01:58.532 --> 02:01.467
Jesus. No.

02:01.535 --> 02:02.902
Where'd you get that from?

02:02.969 --> 02:04.170
She's come forward.

02:04.237 --> 02:06.072
I swear, Elaine,

02:06.139 --> 02:08.139
I barely met the woman
before you tossed her.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.508
She has dates.

02:10.577 --> 02:12.244
Specifics about
when you had sex,

02:12.312 --> 02:13.813
what you prefer in bed...

02:13.880 --> 02:15.181
Baby, it's a bunch a lies.

02:15.248 --> 02:16.549
She's just trying

02:16.616 --> 02:18.484
to save her own ass
for getting fired.

02:18.552 --> 02:20.319
You said that last time.

02:20.387 --> 02:22.221
I haven't done anything
since I held this office.

02:22.289 --> 02:23.656
I've been good like we talked about.
You haven't been good.

02:23.724 --> 02:25.725
You're just a rotten
and lying bastard!

02:25.792 --> 02:28.427
That is 17th century
Qing dynasty!

02:28.495 --> 02:29.795
Now, Mao gave that to Nixon...!

02:36.402 --> 02:39.004
So you talked the Iranians

02:39.072 --> 02:40.639
into sitting down
with us in Oman?

02:40.706 --> 02:43.575
I guaranteed the Sultan
we'd protect him.

02:43.643 --> 02:45.777
The location
has to be top secret.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.779
And you want me to send
your ex-husband to negotiate?

02:47.847 --> 02:50.749
Elaine, the former
president is a joke.

02:50.817 --> 02:53.185
He's one sex scandal away
from <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

02:53.252 --> 02:56.555
Sending a former U.S. President

02:56.622 --> 02:58.056
gives Hakam the clout he needs

02:58.124 --> 03:00.659
to get his country
to the negotiating table,

03:00.726 --> 03:02.094
and it gives you the chance

03:02.161 --> 03:03.995
to talk Iran off
their weapons program

03:04.063 --> 03:07.432
without looking like we got
pushed around by terrorists.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.734
If I could just interrupt.

03:10.302 --> 03:12.203
Maybe it would send a stronger

03:12.271 --> 03:16.074
message if we sent a seated
member of the administration.

03:16.141 --> 03:18.476
I do have some experience
in these matters.

03:18.544 --> 03:20.578
No way, Fred. Sorry.

03:20.646 --> 03:22.213
Elaine, your husband himself

03:22.281 --> 03:24.782
sent me to Mexico to
negotiate the release

03:24.850 --> 03:25.984
of those American citizens.

03:26.051 --> 03:27.518
That was Mexico

03:27.586 --> 03:30.888
and two college students
smuggling a Volvo of pot.

03:30.956 --> 03:33.391
This is Iran accusing innocent

03:33.459 --> 03:34.892
American journalists
of being spies.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.962
These negotiations won't
happen over margaritas.

03:38.030 --> 03:40.765
Regardless of his personal
exploits,

03:40.833 --> 03:42.767
there is no one else with Bud's

03:42.835 --> 03:44.268
international stature

03:44.336 --> 03:47.038
or his experience negotiating
at this level.

03:47.106 --> 03:48.840
Seems like you've got
all the angles figured out.

03:48.907 --> 03:52.143
I'm not exactly sure
what you need me for.

03:52.211 --> 03:55.458
Well, obviously, I need
your blessing, Mr. President.

03:55.857 --> 03:57.367
And if I don't give it?

04:01.754 --> 04:03.921
Barry, sit down with the
vice president and Donovan,

04:03.989 --> 04:05.590
hammer out a statement.

04:05.658 --> 04:07.425
Announce that we're sending
the former president

04:07.493 --> 04:08.693
to negotiate with Hakam.

04:08.761 --> 04:09.694
Thank you, sir.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.567
Now, if this goes wrong--
if hostages end up dead

04:16.635 --> 04:18.769
and Iran still wants
their nukes--

04:18.837 --> 04:21.005
I think you're through
being America's sweetheart.

04:21.072 --> 04:23.708
You own this one now, Elaine.

04:26.811 --> 04:28.979
Garcetti went for it?

04:29.047 --> 04:31.815
Yes. We have a strategy
debrief at 0800.

04:31.883 --> 04:34.017
Your father is
wheels up in an hour.

04:34.085 --> 04:36.586
Have I waited long enough
to ask you what the hell

04:36.654 --> 04:38.789
you're thinking throwing
Dad back into the ring?

04:38.856 --> 04:40.691
Maybe you should worry
about telling your fiancÃ©e

04:40.758 --> 04:42.859
we have to push
the engagement party.

04:42.927 --> 04:45.929
Shit. We have to
push the party.

04:45.997 --> 04:47.397
We'll just do it at the house,

04:47.465 --> 04:48.699
time TBD, simple.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.801
Yeah.
Has T.J. called you?

04:50.868 --> 04:53.270
I am just getting that knot
in my stomach.

04:53.337 --> 04:54.905
You know,
I could be gone 24 hours

04:54.972 --> 04:56.339
and no one would even notice.

04:56.407 --> 04:58.642
Your brother is an addict,
and a hundred million people

04:58.710 --> 05:00.510
just found out
he tried to kill himself.

05:00.578 --> 05:02.412
Yeah, I'm working on it.

05:08.552 --> 05:10.386
<i>We're calling it "The Dome."</i>

05:10.454 --> 05:12.355
It's a restaurant
and a nightclub.

05:12.423 --> 05:14.691
View of the Dome, exposed brick
and a killer hand-carved bar.

05:14.758 --> 05:16.426
It's gonna be awesome.

05:16.494 --> 05:18.094
Or it would be
if my dickhead father would

05:18.162 --> 05:19.395
float me the cash to invest.

05:19.463 --> 05:20.997
I figured your dad was loaded.

05:21.065 --> 05:22.899
Seems like he could spare
a little pocket change.

05:22.967 --> 05:24.367
You'd think so, right?

05:24.435 --> 05:25.835
I mean, considering
he's constantly doling out

05:25.903 --> 05:27.604
hush money
to all the women he screwed.

05:29.673 --> 05:31.407
Don't worry. It's
just my boyfriend.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.944
You didn't tell
me you had a boyfriend!

05:35.012 --> 05:36.746
Levi? He won't be mad.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.882
He sounds pretty frickin' mad.

05:38.949 --> 05:41.184
You're on my list,
famous guys I can cheat with.

05:41.252 --> 05:42.418
You're number two.

05:42.486 --> 05:44.020
Who's number one?

05:44.088 --> 05:45.788
Rob Pattinson,
but he's not gay.

05:45.856 --> 05:48.491
Yep. He's not.

05:48.559 --> 05:49.926
<i>Stuff on Hakam?</i>

05:49.994 --> 05:51.361
Uh, check.

05:51.428 --> 05:53.163
Stuff on the country
that shall remain nameless?

05:53.230 --> 05:54.764
Check.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.200
Also, Alex called.
Call him back.

05:57.268 --> 06:00.470
Tell him I just turned in
a story no one else has.

06:00.538 --> 06:01.671
Tell him I'm on assignment,

06:01.739 --> 06:03.406
but the destination
is embargoed.

06:03.507 --> 06:05.508
Tell him I already moved
my stuff out of our apartment,

06:05.576 --> 06:09.212
and tell him he's a lying,
cheating piece of shit.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.948
I don't, uh, really want to say
that last part.

06:12.016 --> 06:14.384
Tell him it's in quotes.
You're just reporting the news.

Thanks for picking me up, man.

07:14.008 --> 07:17.444
Mom is worried sick about you.

07:17.512 --> 07:19.079
As usual.

07:22.517 --> 07:25.252
You're not gonna tell her
the details, are you?

07:25.320 --> 07:26.687
No.

07:28.556 --> 07:30.624
Look, I'm sorry

07:30.692 --> 07:32.593
that you had to deal with
that stupid story, okay?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.428
We tried to stop it.

07:35.897 --> 07:38.065
It's old news.

07:38.133 --> 07:39.600
People were gonna find out.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.335
It's cool.

07:42.403 --> 07:44.705
Listen, T.J.,

07:44.773 --> 07:49.076
this is a really
important week to me

07:49.144 --> 07:50.944
with the engagement.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.679
And there is a lot going on.

07:52.747 --> 07:56.917
So can you please just show up

07:56.985 --> 07:59.520
and be there for me this time?

07:59.587 --> 08:02.756
You know I always got
your back, little bro.

08:02.824 --> 08:04.291
Stop smiling at me.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.126
I was only born
three minutes after you.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.229
But you'll still
never catch up.

08:09.297 --> 08:10.531
Put on your seat belt.

08:10.598 --> 08:12.032
Okay.

08:22.377 --> 08:25.879
Hey, sugar, look at us.

08:25.947 --> 08:27.447
Just like old times.

08:27.515 --> 08:30.284
I'm here to brief you, Bud,
and that's all.

08:30.351 --> 08:32.251
Well, go ahead.
You're the boss.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.754
After you land in Oman,

08:34.821 --> 08:36.789
you'll have
a private meeting with Hakam.

08:36.857 --> 08:38.090
Keep it short.

08:38.158 --> 08:39.759
Then the two of you will do

08:39.826 --> 08:41.861
a grip-and-grin photo op
for Al Jazeera.

08:41.928 --> 08:46.032
Just smile and pretend he's not
a deceitful, treacherous rat.

08:46.099 --> 08:47.666
I went by the hotel
and ended things with Eva.

08:47.734 --> 08:49.769
I couldn't lead her on anymore,

08:49.836 --> 08:52.104
now that you and I reconnected.

08:52.172 --> 08:53.339
We have not reconnected.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.208
That was a one-time thing.

08:56.276 --> 08:58.778
It didn't feel like a one-time thing.
It was.

08:58.845 --> 09:02.348
I'd had an extremely bad day
and I was, I was vulnerable.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.450
You were insatiable.

09:04.518 --> 09:06.719
Focus, please.
There's still some question

09:06.787 --> 09:09.422
about what you're
authorized to offer Hakam.

09:09.489 --> 09:10.956
Garcetti's keeping
his greasy paws clean.

09:11.024 --> 09:12.558
That figures.

09:12.626 --> 09:14.560
Now if that Guinea son of a
bitch gave me the tools,

09:14.628 --> 09:19.231
I could have Hakam at the U.N.
by next week, pissing fuel rods.

09:19.299 --> 09:21.667
Listen to yourself.
This is your sickness.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.936
I ask you to quietly
save the lives

09:24.004 --> 09:25.638
of three innocent people,

09:25.705 --> 09:27.973
and instantly you think you
can save the whole world.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.042
That's why you fell in love
with me, sugar.

09:33.113 --> 09:37.149
What's the Bitch of the Beltway
doing here?

09:37.217 --> 09:39.885
Finishing her feature on me.

09:39.953 --> 09:42.822
I told her she could cover
this trip on background.

09:42.889 --> 09:44.924
She won a Pulitzer
for hating our guts.

09:44.991 --> 09:47.426
Turns out she doesn't hate us,
just you.

09:47.494 --> 09:49.895
Travel safe, Bud.

09:49.963 --> 09:51.597
Do your best.

09:51.665 --> 09:54.900
Don't worry, sweetheart, the
hard shit I usually get right.

09:54.968 --> 09:57.903
It's the simple shit I screw up.

10:00.006 --> 10:01.507
Madam Secretary?

10:01.575 --> 10:03.709
Excuse me.

10:03.777 --> 10:07.813
I'm really grateful you're
giving me this opportunity.

10:07.881 --> 10:09.682
Don't be grateful.
We're both just doing our jobs.

10:09.749 --> 10:10.983
If all goes well,

10:11.051 --> 10:13.486
this will make a hell of an end
to my story on you.

10:13.553 --> 10:15.154
You may even want to read it.

10:15.222 --> 10:16.956
I told you, Ms. Berg,

10:17.023 --> 10:19.658
I stopped reading what people
wrote about me a long time ago.

10:19.726 --> 10:21.594
Good luck.

10:23.763 --> 10:25.331
Three or four years
ago-- I know, I know,

10:25.398 --> 10:28.000
you may not have heard this--
this guy went on his ass

10:28.068 --> 10:30.002
into the pond
at the White House.

10:30.070 --> 10:32.338
I don't know what he was
drinking or what he was....

10:32.405 --> 10:33.906
Elaine, I didn't do it.

10:33.974 --> 10:40.312
I did not have sex
with Sarah Latham, and that is

10:40.380 --> 10:41.881
the God's honest truth.

10:41.948 --> 10:43.682
Now I know I've lied
in the past,

10:43.750 --> 10:45.384
but I'm not lying this time.

10:47.454 --> 10:49.188
Come on, baby.

10:49.256 --> 10:51.524
Please believe me.
I'm telling the truth.

10:51.591 --> 10:52.992
Why would she do that?

10:53.059 --> 10:54.393
I don't know.

10:54.461 --> 10:56.061
I don't know,
but I'm telling the truth.

10:56.129 --> 10:57.997
Come on. Shh.

10:59.065 --> 11:00.566
Shh.

11:10.619 --> 11:13.054
<i>Do you know what goes</i>

11:13.121 --> 11:15.323
through our minds
when you disappear like that?

11:15.390 --> 11:17.825
Your mom and I both think
you're dead.

11:17.893 --> 11:19.727
I'm sorry.

11:19.795 --> 11:22.697
I'm just glad that Dougie had
the sense to bring you by here

11:22.764 --> 11:26.234
so you could recover from
whatever it was you were doing

11:26.301 --> 11:29.170
with whatever unfortunate boy
you were doing it with,

11:29.238 --> 11:32.440
because I need you to go
through all of this with me.

11:32.508 --> 11:34.442
What exactly are
we looking for?

11:34.510 --> 11:37.111
Sheet music from my Vegas days.

11:37.179 --> 11:40.014
I'm thinking that we could do
a number together.

11:40.082 --> 11:42.984
You know, for Dougie
and Anne's engagement party.

11:43.051 --> 11:45.086
Have you mentioned that
to Momma?

11:45.153 --> 11:47.154
Oh, she loves it
when I headline.

11:49.724 --> 11:51.992
How long have these things
been in, uh, hibernation?

11:52.060 --> 11:55.228
Since before your
mother was toilet trained.

11:55.296 --> 11:58.065
Oh, come on, Momma was
never not toilet trained.

11:58.132 --> 12:01.168
Well, it was fast,
I'll grant you that.

12:01.235 --> 12:02.636
She was like a puppy.

12:02.704 --> 12:04.671
One swat on her fanny
with a newspaper,

12:04.739 --> 12:06.606
and that was it.

12:06.674 --> 12:08.909
I need a screwdriver

12:08.976 --> 12:11.611
to loosen up my pipes, and I
don't mean a Phillips head.

12:14.182 --> 12:16.650
That's your cue to make
your grandmother a drink.

12:21.188 --> 12:23.256
<i>So, Berg,</i>

12:23.323 --> 12:25.424
how'd you end up on this?

12:25.492 --> 12:27.527
The Hammonds hate you.

12:27.594 --> 12:29.795
I got the Secretary's mother
calling you a bitch on record.

12:29.863 --> 12:32.565
I was nice enough not
to print it, of course.

12:32.633 --> 12:33.799
What can I say, Gary?

12:33.867 --> 12:35.868
I guess this bitch
is just good at her job.

12:35.936 --> 12:38.337
You still sleeping
with your boss?

12:38.405 --> 12:40.439
Still cheating on your wife?
That's not funny.

12:40.507 --> 12:42.241
She left me six weeks ago.

12:42.309 --> 12:43.709
Really?

12:43.777 --> 12:45.978
I'm so happy for her.

12:46.046 --> 12:47.813
Excuse me, Ms. Berg?

12:47.881 --> 12:49.515
President Hammond
requested that you join him.

12:53.153 --> 12:55.721
Make sure he wears a condom.

12:55.789 --> 12:57.123
That's funny.

13:00.727 --> 13:02.028
You weren't asleep, were you?

13:02.095 --> 13:05.031
No, I imagine
you were wide awake,

13:05.098 --> 13:07.500
sharpening your pencils,
or your knives, or whatever.

13:07.568 --> 13:09.535
Relax, have a drink.
There's a full bar.

13:09.603 --> 13:12.371
Hell, we've even got M&M'S with
the presidential seal on them.

13:12.439 --> 13:16.042
I like the green ones,

13:16.109 --> 13:18.344
so hands off those.

13:18.412 --> 13:20.479
Why did you invite me in here,
Mr. President?

13:20.547 --> 13:22.782
It's a long flight,
and I like company.

13:22.849 --> 13:24.150
So I've heard.

13:24.218 --> 13:26.586
Take a load off.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.990
I can, uh, give you
a little background

13:31.058 --> 13:33.192
on that story
you're writing about Elaine.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.328
Stoli.

13:35.395 --> 13:36.562
Rocks, please.

13:36.630 --> 13:38.097
There we go.

13:39.065 --> 13:40.599
My daddy

13:40.666 --> 13:43.201
used to say,
"There's nothing more appealing

13:43.269 --> 13:45.804
than a lady
who likes a stiff one."

13:48.241 --> 13:50.542
You play Words with Friends?

13:50.610 --> 13:52.010
Uh, yeah, that and Skyping

13:52.078 --> 13:54.613
are about all I know
how to use that thing for.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.248
Yeah, Brokaw got me started.

13:56.315 --> 13:57.649
He's not very good, though.

13:57.717 --> 13:58.917
And you, do you play?

13:58.985 --> 14:00.519
I used to.

14:00.586 --> 14:02.687
I beat all my friends,
so no one will play against me.

14:02.755 --> 14:05.790
You're that good, or are you
just that low on friends?

14:05.858 --> 14:08.226
You don't seem to have a lot
of friends yourself these days.

14:08.294 --> 14:09.928
Yeah, I get it.

14:09.996 --> 14:11.863
You don't like me.
Mr. President,

14:11.931 --> 14:14.099
I know you think I had some kind
of journalistic vendetta.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.634
I-I didn't.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.636
I write about what the country
is talking about.

14:17.703 --> 14:19.704
Listen,

14:19.772 --> 14:21.873
Columbia just did a study
on presidential legacies.

14:21.941 --> 14:23.808
They asked people to say
the first word

14:23.876 --> 14:26.178
that popped into their head when
asked about former presidents.

14:27.545 --> 14:29.480
Abraham Lincoln,
people said honesty.

14:29.547 --> 14:31.415
Nixon, Watergate.

14:31.483 --> 14:33.150
When they heard Bud Hammond,

14:33.218 --> 14:34.885
you know what the majority
of people say?

14:35.854 --> 14:36.787
Sex.

14:36.855 --> 14:39.556
How about JFK?

14:39.624 --> 14:40.557
Assassination.

14:40.625 --> 14:41.692
I'll bet you

14:41.759 --> 14:44.561
he'd just as soon they said sex.

14:44.629 --> 14:46.063
Come on.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.332
Ms. Berg, put your pen down.

14:48.399 --> 14:51.235
Let's play a couple of rounds.

14:51.302 --> 14:52.903
I'll even let you go first.

14:55.373 --> 14:57.007
All right.

14:57.075 --> 14:58.709
What is it, Douglas?

14:58.776 --> 15:00.777
As to the
whereabouts of the talks,

15:00.845 --> 15:03.447
the vice president
had this to say.

15:03.515 --> 15:06.517
I can neither confirm nor deny
there's any hostages talks

15:06.584 --> 15:08.018
going on in Oman, period.

15:08.086 --> 15:11.288
That little rat.

15:11.356 --> 15:14.091
Elaine, now, I know
what you're going to say.

15:14.158 --> 15:15.659
Even you are smart enough

15:15.727 --> 15:19.596
to know that neither confirming
nor denying <i>is</i> the same

15:19.664 --> 15:22.332
as confirming there's
a secret meeting in Oman.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.468
For instance, if I said,
"I can neither confirm

15:24.536 --> 15:28.372
"nor deny that Vice President
Collier is a pissy little shit

15:28.439 --> 15:30.574
who just sent three people
to their deaths

15:30.642 --> 15:32.609
because he wasn't the one picked
to rescue them,"

15:32.677 --> 15:34.378
what would you take it to mean?

15:34.445 --> 15:35.646
No need to get personal, Elaine.

15:35.713 --> 15:36.713
You made

15:36.781 --> 15:38.348
this personal, Fred,

15:38.416 --> 15:40.317
when you were passed over
to meet with Hakam.

15:40.385 --> 15:42.753
I won't lie
to the American people.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.821
I'm not Bud Hammond.

15:44.889 --> 15:47.124
You're goddamn right you're not.

15:47.191 --> 15:48.559
Honestly.

15:48.626 --> 15:50.093
Idiot.

15:50.161 --> 15:51.695
Mom,

15:51.763 --> 15:54.197
that was the Vice President
of the United States.

15:54.265 --> 15:55.532
What's going on?

15:55.600 --> 15:56.767
Nothing.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.869
Really?
Because in the last day,

15:58.937 --> 16:01.338
you've defied the president,
threatened your resignation,

16:01.406 --> 16:02.806
put your entire reputation

16:02.874 --> 16:04.608
on the line, and offered Dad

16:04.676 --> 16:06.109
the first spotlight
in two years

16:06.177 --> 16:07.578
that didn't make him out

16:07.645 --> 16:09.246
to be an over-sexed
political has-been,

16:09.314 --> 16:11.048
so I'd appreciate
the truth, Mom,

16:11.115 --> 16:13.183
and I think I've earned it
when I ask you,

16:13.251 --> 16:14.985
"What the hell is going on?"

16:16.153 --> 16:18.220
I'm just sick of it all,
that's what's going on.

16:18.288 --> 16:21.123
I am sick to death
of the bullshit and the egos

16:21.191 --> 16:22.658
and of the men.

16:22.726 --> 16:23.993
I am sick of the men.

16:24.061 --> 16:25.594
Just one time,

16:25.662 --> 16:27.396
just once, I would like
to accomplish something

16:27.464 --> 16:30.332
in this city without having
to spend all of my energy

16:30.400 --> 16:32.868
navigating the shortsighted,

16:32.936 --> 16:35.805
selfish, self-involved,
and oh-so-fragile

16:35.872 --> 16:38.974
male egos that suck up all
the oxygen in this town.

16:39.042 --> 16:40.409
It makes me so sick,

16:40.477 --> 16:44.346
Douglas, so sick
I could puke for days.

16:44.414 --> 16:47.049
I'm running for president.

16:48.618 --> 16:49.885
Okay, if that...

16:49.953 --> 16:51.287
If that was
your announcement speech,

16:51.354 --> 16:52.822
you just lost
half your vote, okay?

16:52.889 --> 16:54.523
Anyway, Mom,
you have at least four years...

16:54.591 --> 16:56.325
In two years.
I'm running now,

16:56.393 --> 16:57.960
against Garcetti.
You're the Secretary of State.

16:58.028 --> 17:00.262
How would you even think
about doing something like that?

17:00.330 --> 17:03.032
I don't know. You're just the
second person I've said this to.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.366
Who was the first?

17:04.434 --> 17:06.135
Clark.
You're diplomatic security?

17:06.203 --> 17:08.137
Yes. He thought it
was a good idea.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.704
- Well, that's nice.
- Excuse me.

17:09.772 --> 17:11.874
Sultan of Oman on one.

17:11.942 --> 17:14.510
I'm gonna have to ask you to table
whatever emotional reaction

17:14.578 --> 17:16.912
you're having,
given today's crisis.

17:18.815 --> 17:20.882
Yes, Your Majesty?

17:22.151 --> 17:23.585
<i>Did you find anything?</i>

17:23.653 --> 17:24.819
"Tender Trap."

17:24.887 --> 17:26.454
"Second Time Around."

17:26.521 --> 17:28.423
"When I Fall in Love."
Wait a minute.

17:28.491 --> 17:29.458
Go back one.

17:31.327 --> 17:33.862
"Love is lovelier the
second time around."

17:33.930 --> 17:36.965
I don't know. I mean,
is-is it appropriate?

17:37.033 --> 17:38.967
They haven't even had their
first time around. Humor me.

17:39.035 --> 17:41.303
I already know this one.

17:41.370 --> 17:44.773
And we'll figure out
some bullshit relevance

17:44.841 --> 17:46.241
later on.

17:48.344 --> 17:50.245
How come you never
had a club act?

17:50.313 --> 17:52.514
I was happy to just be
a Copa girl.

17:52.582 --> 17:55.517
Besides, there was a trumpet
player I was crazy about.

17:55.585 --> 17:57.853
That guy had

17:57.920 --> 18:00.856
an embouchure to die for.

18:00.923 --> 18:02.824
Embouchure?
Yeah,

18:02.892 --> 18:04.526
it's a horn player's
bread and butter.

18:04.594 --> 18:07.929
His mouth, the lips,

18:07.997 --> 18:11.500
the buzzing they made
when they blow.

18:11.567 --> 18:14.970
We're-we're still talking
about horn-playing, right?

18:15.037 --> 18:16.605
It's all jazz, baby.

18:16.672 --> 18:19.708
Well, you know I'm trying
to open my own nightclub.

18:19.775 --> 18:21.109
You and me can work up

18:21.177 --> 18:22.944
a set of these old standards.

18:23.012 --> 18:26.014
All I need is a little start-up
capital, and we can...

18:26.082 --> 18:28.149
Oh, nice try, sweetie.
Nice try.

18:28.217 --> 18:30.552
But I make a practice
at not throwing money

18:30.620 --> 18:32.554
at guys I adore.

18:32.622 --> 18:33.889
Excuse me.

18:33.956 --> 18:35.423
Hmm?
The delivery men are here,

18:35.491 --> 18:37.092
and they need a check
for the flowers.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.093
Oh, right.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.327
Elaine called.

18:39.395 --> 18:41.830
I already got that covered.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.167
There you go.

18:46.235 --> 18:47.669
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:47.737 --> 18:51.306
$2,000 for Flowers by Carl.

18:51.374 --> 18:54.009
What a racket, huh?

18:54.076 --> 18:56.945
You know, I need a-a refill.

18:57.013 --> 19:00.282
And when I come back, I'm gonna
stop blabbering about the past.

19:29.853 --> 19:31.520
<i>Maybe we should
play something else.</i>

19:31.588 --> 19:33.689
I am <i>crushing</i> you.
Oh, thanks, Antoine.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.524
You're welcome, sir.

19:35.592 --> 19:39.261
Well, let's make
this one interesting.

19:41.064 --> 19:42.932
How much you got on you?

19:42.999 --> 19:44.834
About 80 bucks.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.737
You're serious?
I play better

19:48.805 --> 19:50.339
when the stakes are high.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.676
You ever been this close
to the action?

19:53.743 --> 19:55.611
Covered foreign affairs.

19:55.679 --> 19:57.213
So no.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.950
I guarantee when this is over,

20:01.017 --> 20:04.787
you're gonna feel a rush
like you never felt before.

20:04.855 --> 20:08.190
The most thrilling moment
of my first term

20:08.258 --> 20:11.293
was, uh, taking out
those Somalian pirates

20:11.361 --> 20:12.561
that commandeered
that oil tanker.

20:13.429 --> 20:14.562
You remember that?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.031
Must have felt great.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.799
Oh, yeah, it sure did.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.100
Sarah Latham wrote in her book

20:19.168 --> 20:20.235
that you two started

20:20.303 --> 20:21.803
your affair around that time.

20:21.871 --> 20:23.805
Think there was any correlation?

20:28.644 --> 20:32.414
Anybody ever tell you
you're a real downer, Ms. Berg?

20:38.854 --> 20:40.922
A seven-letter bonus?
"Mihrabs"?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.524
It's the part of the mosque

20:42.591 --> 20:45.627
that indicates
the direction of Mecca.

20:45.695 --> 20:48.263
Well, I believe I won
this round.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.231
I have been had.

20:50.299 --> 20:52.500
You are a Words
with Friends shark.

20:52.568 --> 20:53.968
Come in.

20:54.036 --> 20:55.970
Excuse me, sir, I have
the Secretary of State for you.

20:56.038 --> 20:57.105
Oh, right.

20:58.373 --> 21:00.073
Thank you.

21:01.609 --> 21:02.943
Hey, sugar.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.212
Looking beautiful as ever.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.282
Uh, I have Ms. Berg here
with me.

21:08.349 --> 21:09.616
Bud, there's been
a change of venue.

21:09.684 --> 21:11.118
Oman pulled out.

21:11.185 --> 21:12.586
Oh, so where are we going,
Turkey?

21:12.654 --> 21:13.954
How did you know?

21:14.022 --> 21:15.822
Well, we need a place
two hours away,

21:15.890 --> 21:17.057
has to be Islamic,

21:17.125 --> 21:19.426
so, uh, Georgia and Armenia
are out.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.695
Syria and Iraq, gone, gone.
Egypt...

21:21.763 --> 21:23.196
I'm sure Ms. Berg
is already aware

21:23.264 --> 21:24.998
that you're
a geopolitical genius,

21:25.066 --> 21:26.333
but we still have

21:26.401 --> 21:28.468
no concessions to offer,
so it'll be up to you

21:28.536 --> 21:32.406
to do what you do best,
make shit up.

21:33.575 --> 21:35.175
Can you hold on one second?

21:35.243 --> 21:37.110
The Turkish embassy says
they don't expect him back

21:37.178 --> 21:39.112
for another hour or two.
We don't have another hour.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.547
Find out where he is.

21:40.615 --> 21:42.816
The Secretary is asking,
uh, where His Excellency

21:42.884 --> 21:44.117
might be reached?

21:45.153 --> 21:46.420
Oh. I see.

21:46.487 --> 21:50.190
Um, the ambassador
is in the Hamam.

21:50.258 --> 21:52.426
Please tell His Excellency
that I will be there

21:52.493 --> 21:53.894
in 15 minutes.

21:53.962 --> 21:55.862
Good-bye.

21:55.930 --> 21:58.231
Mom, do you know
what a Hamam is?

21:58.299 --> 22:00.067
It's a Turkish bath.

22:00.134 --> 22:02.936
Well, why didn't you
say something?

22:03.004 --> 22:07.007
You speak 14 languages; I
figured you knew what it meant.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.177
âª Well, I wear my clothes
like this because I can âª

22:10.244 --> 22:13.347
âª And I wear my hair like this
because I can âª

22:13.414 --> 22:15.248
âª And I walk around
like this... âª

22:15.316 --> 22:16.817
Excuse us.

22:16.884 --> 22:18.885
Coming through.

22:21.355 --> 22:22.689
Good day.

22:28.696 --> 22:30.196
Perhaps I steamed too long.

22:30.264 --> 22:32.165
I must be dreaming.

22:32.233 --> 22:33.399
Serkan, I need a favor.

22:33.467 --> 22:35.602
I have a ticking clock
on those hostages.

22:35.669 --> 22:39.105
I need to negotiate in Turkey
in less than an hour.

22:39.173 --> 22:42.075
The downside being my country
steps between two loaded guns.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.177
The upside being your country
acts as the bridge

22:44.245 --> 22:46.012
between the U.S.
and the Middle East,

22:46.080 --> 22:48.081
which wouldn't hurt
your bid for the EU.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.884
Also, I happen to know your
prime minister has had his eye

22:50.951 --> 22:52.852
on our Cobra attack helicopters.

22:55.922 --> 22:58.090
What do you want
from me, Serkan?

23:00.560 --> 23:05.430
I, uh, sent you some
flowers after your divorce.

23:05.498 --> 23:07.032
You never responded.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.300
I got them.

23:08.368 --> 23:11.003
Uh, all four dozen
of them-- tulips.

23:11.070 --> 23:12.804
Very thoughtful.
Perhaps then, uh,

23:12.872 --> 23:15.741
you would agree to
dinner with me?

23:15.808 --> 23:17.843
You would use the lives
of three Americans

23:17.911 --> 23:19.912
to leverage me
into going out with you?

23:19.979 --> 23:23.415
You would sacrifice their
lives to not go out with me?

23:23.483 --> 23:26.051
Fine.

23:26.119 --> 23:29.988
Then we'll have a private tarmac
waiting for your negotiations.

23:30.056 --> 23:33.659
And, uh... I'll have
my secretary call

23:33.726 --> 23:36.662
to coordinate our dinner.

23:36.729 --> 23:38.163
Would you pull this crap

23:38.231 --> 23:40.799
on a U.S. Secretary of State
if I were a man?

23:40.867 --> 23:42.901
Of course not. I'm
not attracted to men.

23:42.969 --> 23:45.971
You are a scoundrel, Serkan.

23:46.039 --> 23:47.639
But you're an honest scoundrel.

23:47.707 --> 23:49.208
Have a good day.

23:49.275 --> 23:51.843
You, too.

23:52.511 --> 23:55.647
The perfect capper to my day.

23:55.714 --> 23:58.116
Just pimped myself out
for the good of the country.

23:58.184 --> 23:59.217
Here, ma'am.

23:59.285 --> 24:00.218
Very humid in there.

24:00.286 --> 24:01.753
Gallant, as usual.

24:01.821 --> 24:03.555
Your father better deliver.

24:03.622 --> 24:05.924
Are you sure you're not
putting too much faith in him?

24:05.991 --> 24:07.559
I trust him.

24:07.626 --> 24:09.093
How has that worked out
for you in the past?

24:09.161 --> 24:11.229
You're upset.

24:11.297 --> 24:13.398
Okay, let's talk about it.

24:13.465 --> 24:14.966
Thank you.
That depends.

24:15.034 --> 24:17.302
Am I finally allowed to have
my emotional reaction

24:17.369 --> 24:19.270
to the fact that my mother
declared her intentions

24:19.338 --> 24:20.572
to run for president
this morning?

24:20.639 --> 24:22.240
I thought you'd be excited.

24:22.308 --> 24:24.108
You're the one always shouting
that the wrong guys won.

24:24.176 --> 24:27.045
I'm not Garcetti's biggest fan,
but to drag the incumbent

24:27.112 --> 24:29.681
through primaries would split
the DNC in half at best.

24:29.748 --> 24:31.783
And an insurgent campaign
could turn you back into...

24:31.851 --> 24:33.585
Just say it.

24:33.652 --> 24:35.386
Public Bitch Number One.

24:35.454 --> 24:37.956
And did you forget what
the last run did to you? Huh?

24:38.023 --> 24:39.958
18-hour days
with no end in sight,

24:40.025 --> 24:41.826
doctors shooting you up
with B-12 shots.

24:41.894 --> 24:44.262
Douglas, I can handle it.

24:44.330 --> 24:46.231
What about the rest of us?

24:46.298 --> 24:49.167
Anne's ready to leave me, T.J.
can barely keep it together.

24:49.235 --> 24:51.836
Say we do all survive
two years of campaign hell;

24:51.904 --> 24:53.538
where does that leave
our family?

24:53.606 --> 24:54.939
Hopefully, in the White House.

24:55.007 --> 24:57.075
And what about him?

24:57.942 --> 24:59.877
Your private out-of-town meeting
yesterday, when you concocted

24:59.944 --> 25:01.879
this whole rescue operation--
was that with Dad?

25:01.946 --> 25:03.180
Well...

25:03.248 --> 25:05.149
Did you sleep with him?
Okay, you know,

25:05.216 --> 25:07.818
Jesus Christ, I knew it.
It was one of the hardest days of my life,

25:07.886 --> 25:09.153
and it was a
one-time thing.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.954
He's part of this fantasy,
isn't he?

25:11.022 --> 25:14.858
You're still in love with him,
aren't you?

25:14.926 --> 25:16.560
Look at you.

25:16.628 --> 25:18.495
Look at you-- the smartest,
most powerful woman

25:18.563 --> 25:19.997
on the planet,
and you can't even see

25:20.065 --> 25:22.099
that he is just going to
hurt you all over again,

25:22.167 --> 25:24.835
just like he does every time!

25:29.708 --> 25:32.810
Sarah Latham claims to have had
an affair with your husband

25:32.877 --> 25:35.446
that lasted for five months.

25:35.513 --> 25:39.283
I want to start by refuting

25:39.350 --> 25:42.519
the accusations
of this woman, uh...

25:43.187 --> 25:44.654
Oh, Christ, that was terrible.

25:44.722 --> 25:46.623
Um, let me start again.
All right, well, you know,

25:46.691 --> 25:48.124
you don't really
have to do this.

25:48.192 --> 25:49.926
President's already
denied it on all the majors.

25:49.994 --> 25:51.728
No one expects you to make a
public statement. No, I want to.

25:51.796 --> 25:52.896
I want the world to know.

25:52.963 --> 25:54.364
This woman worked for me,

25:54.432 --> 25:56.433
I-I fired her
for incompetence,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.168
and now she makes
up these lies.

25:58.235 --> 25:59.803
And we have too
much to accomplish

25:59.870 --> 26:01.471
in his time left
in this office...

26:01.539 --> 26:03.306
Okay, don't get too lawyer-y.
Skip to the family stuff.

26:03.374 --> 26:05.108
Excuse us, will you, Barry?

26:05.176 --> 26:07.177
All right, thank you, Barry.

26:11.415 --> 26:14.751
Sugar, this interview's
a mistake.

26:14.819 --> 26:17.654
Now, I don't see
what the upside is.

26:17.722 --> 26:20.657
If the First Lady dives into
a panty-rippin' catfight,

26:20.725 --> 26:21.891
all the press...

26:21.959 --> 26:23.693
Is that what you think this is?

26:23.761 --> 26:27.997
You know, I will not let
this woman tell lies.

26:28.065 --> 26:29.632
It's not a lie.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.401
Yes, it is.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.507
It's not a lie, Elaine.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.511
It is... it's
not a lie?

26:44.482 --> 26:46.416
Five months?

26:46.484 --> 26:48.017
In our bed?

26:48.085 --> 26:49.919
Only once.

26:49.987 --> 26:51.588
Oh.

26:55.292 --> 26:57.660
You are the President
of the United States.

26:57.728 --> 26:59.862
Yeah, but that doesn't
make me a saint.

26:59.930 --> 27:01.364
No!

27:01.431 --> 27:05.034
But I thought it would
make you a better man.

27:05.102 --> 27:06.903
I need you to go.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.304
Go!

27:22.015 --> 27:24.183
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, though we've arrived</i>

27:24.251 --> 27:26.552
at our destination,
we kindly ask all members of

27:26.620 --> 27:29.422
the press corps to remain
on board until further notice.

27:29.489 --> 27:30.423
Thank you.

27:30.490 --> 27:31.657
Ms. Berg, follow me.

27:31.725 --> 27:33.459
You got a scarf
or a silk nighty

27:33.527 --> 27:35.061
or something to cover
your head with?

27:35.128 --> 27:36.796
See what you can rustle up.

27:36.863 --> 27:39.532
Uh... yeah.

27:39.599 --> 27:42.802
Mr. President, can I at least
ask what the plan is?

27:42.869 --> 27:45.137
Just stand ten feet behind
me and try to look virtuous.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.305
Hakam!

27:46.373 --> 27:47.973
As-salaam alaikum, buddy!

27:48.041 --> 27:50.209
Good to see you.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.344
Oh, I'm hoping you feel
better than you look,

27:52.412 --> 27:53.946
'cause you look like shit.

27:54.014 --> 27:55.648
President Garcetti

27:55.715 --> 27:59.018
sent his special envoy
to observe our meeting.

28:12.833 --> 28:15.401
I have honored every agreement
made with your government.

28:15.469 --> 28:17.403
You have honored nothing.

28:17.471 --> 28:19.171
Your wife promised
me some concessions.

28:20.339 --> 28:21.906
Ex-wife, Hakam.

28:21.974 --> 28:23.274
Little different.

28:23.342 --> 28:26.244
Look, you can take
all the photographs you want

28:26.312 --> 28:28.613
of me and you smiling
and shaking hands.

28:28.681 --> 28:29.714
But that's all

28:29.782 --> 28:30.848
I can offer today.

28:40.826 --> 28:43.294
Then the
prisoners must be executed.

28:43.362 --> 28:45.997
You leave me no choice.

28:46.065 --> 28:48.666
You're dying, Hakam.

28:48.734 --> 28:51.703
Now, I'm sorry,
but Garcetti was never

28:51.770 --> 28:53.571
coming to the table.

28:53.639 --> 28:56.307
And to kidnap innocent people
to force his hand

28:56.375 --> 28:58.843
was a little bat-shit crazy.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.779
Now, you have to let me
bring these people home.

29:01.847 --> 29:03.181
If I give into you

29:03.249 --> 29:06.784
without some concession,

29:06.852 --> 29:09.454
they will call me
the Coward of Iran.

29:16.095 --> 29:18.730
President Garcetti's
special envoy has authority

29:18.797 --> 29:20.765
to speak for the president
in certain cases.

29:20.833 --> 29:22.166
You give me a moment

29:22.234 --> 29:24.202
to appeal to her.

29:28.007 --> 29:29.641
What the hell are you doing?

29:29.708 --> 29:31.376
I'm negotiating with you.

29:31.443 --> 29:33.878
You are hanging
on my every word.

29:35.146 --> 29:36.713
Now shake your
head "no."

29:39.917 --> 29:42.752
So we'll try again.

29:42.820 --> 29:44.721
Now you're terribly torn,

29:44.789 --> 29:47.157
because you'd like to
give me what I want,

29:47.225 --> 29:49.292
but you don't want
to get into trouble.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.460
Good.

29:50.528 --> 29:52.762
Now look at me
and say "yes."

29:52.830 --> 29:54.231
Yes.

29:56.267 --> 29:57.801
Thank you.

29:57.869 --> 29:58.969
I enjoyed that.

29:59.036 --> 30:01.438
Hakam,

30:01.506 --> 30:03.740
you'll get your visit

30:03.808 --> 30:06.543
from Garcetti,
when your funeral is attended

30:06.611 --> 30:08.845
by the President
of the United States.

30:08.913 --> 30:10.614
Now, at that time,

30:10.681 --> 30:13.717
talks will begin in earnest--
but with your successor.

30:13.784 --> 30:14.985
I'm sorry, pal,

30:15.052 --> 30:17.020
it's not happening today.

30:17.088 --> 30:18.955
But you have my word.

30:19.023 --> 30:21.791
Now, I will tell the world
that it was your dying wish

30:21.859 --> 30:23.493
that brought America
to the peace table.

30:23.561 --> 30:26.129
And I'll also

30:26.197 --> 30:30.433
attend your funeral,
pay my own respects.

30:30.501 --> 30:32.936
To the Hero of Iran.

30:38.709 --> 30:40.544
<i>There you go.</i>

30:40.611 --> 30:42.178
Oh, my God!

30:42.246 --> 30:44.381
Slow down.

30:44.448 --> 30:46.016
Wait.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.218
Other way.

30:48.286 --> 30:52.055
Are we having sex
or am I parallel parking?

30:52.123 --> 30:53.790
I'm sorry.

30:53.858 --> 30:55.225
I can't concentrate.

30:57.494 --> 30:59.762
God, all I can think
about is my parents

30:59.830 --> 31:02.198
waiting at the Marriott,
just sitting there,

31:02.265 --> 31:05.034
trying to figure out
when our party is going to be.

31:05.101 --> 31:06.969
I should just tell them
to watch CNN,

31:07.037 --> 31:11.140
and if the hostages get on
the plane, call the relatives.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.908
Are they really pissed?
Are you kidding me?

31:12.976 --> 31:14.176
They love this.

31:14.244 --> 31:15.711
My mom has
started blogging about

31:15.779 --> 31:17.980
what it's like to be
this close to history.

31:18.048 --> 31:18.981
Come on.

31:19.049 --> 31:20.816
It's cute.

31:22.285 --> 31:25.087
They're proud of you.

31:25.155 --> 31:26.922
Mm-hmm.

31:28.892 --> 31:31.494
For what?

31:31.561 --> 31:36.398
All I did was catch Washington's
Most Eligible Bachelor.

31:36.466 --> 31:37.433
Mm-hmm.

31:37.501 --> 31:40.102
And my mother is convinced

31:40.170 --> 31:43.706
I'm gonna screw it up
somehow and embarrass her.

31:43.773 --> 31:46.609
You're gonna
screw it up somehow?

31:48.979 --> 31:50.212
Who the hell is that?

31:50.280 --> 31:51.547
It's 1:00 in
the morning.

31:56.586 --> 31:57.820
Dougie?

31:57.888 --> 31:59.388
It's me.

32:00.790 --> 32:02.491
I'm sorry.

32:02.559 --> 32:04.894
Anne, hey.
Were you guys sleeping?

32:04.961 --> 32:06.695
No, T.J., we weren't sleeping.
Oh, shit.

32:06.763 --> 32:07.696
I'm sorry.

32:07.764 --> 32:09.431
Uh, you said I should come here.

32:09.499 --> 32:10.900
I didn't know where else to go.

32:10.967 --> 32:12.635
I'll be in bed.

32:15.238 --> 32:17.473
God.

32:18.441 --> 32:20.141
I screwed up.

32:20.209 --> 32:22.043
You got to help me.
Really?

32:22.111 --> 32:24.612
You know that club
I was trying to go in on?

32:24.680 --> 32:26.080
Mom and Dad wouldn't
write me the check,

32:26.148 --> 32:27.682
so I clipped one from Nana.

32:27.750 --> 32:29.884
Oh, my God. I ask you
to stay sober for two days,

32:29.952 --> 32:31.686
and now you're stealing money
from Nana?

32:31.754 --> 32:33.455
If it was you that was asking
them, then they would've,

32:33.522 --> 32:34.856
they would've given it
to you in a second!

32:34.924 --> 32:36.324
You want to know
what the best part is?

32:36.392 --> 32:39.127
My business partners
wouldn't even take it.

32:39.195 --> 32:41.095
They said it was fine
if I didn't have the whole nut.

32:41.163 --> 32:44.699
All they really needed
was my <i>name.</i>

32:44.767 --> 32:46.668
It's genius, right?

32:46.735 --> 32:47.869
So what am I now?

32:47.937 --> 32:49.270
Just some kind of Page Six joke

32:49.338 --> 32:50.772
that they can stand
at the front door?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.640
How did I even...

32:52.708 --> 32:55.109
become this person?

32:55.177 --> 32:57.312
Look, I know...

32:57.379 --> 32:58.646
I know it's my fault.

32:58.714 --> 33:00.448
Do you think I really
want to live like this?

33:00.516 --> 33:02.784
Before the suicide story broke,

33:02.852 --> 33:04.352
I went for five months
without doing blow.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.587
I was good, Dougie!

33:05.654 --> 33:07.455
You gotta believe me.

33:09.791 --> 33:12.159
I just need to catch a break.

33:14.062 --> 33:16.197
I'll give you the money.

33:16.264 --> 33:18.766
It's not a gift, it's a loan,

33:18.833 --> 33:20.901
and you are back in
the program tomorrow.

33:20.969 --> 33:22.203
Whatever you say.
And do not tell Mom

33:22.270 --> 33:23.571
or Anne that I'm doing this.

33:23.638 --> 33:25.039
They would fight over
who killed me first,

33:25.106 --> 33:26.307
and they'd both be right.

33:27.576 --> 33:29.944
I love you, brother.

33:34.382 --> 33:36.750
There's a blanket
in the closet.

33:39.953 --> 33:40.953
<i>I'll tell you,</i>

33:41.021 --> 33:42.322
there's gonna be

33:42.389 --> 33:44.257
one hell of a hullabaloo
at Andrews.

33:46.660 --> 33:48.594
Yeah.

33:50.631 --> 33:52.432
If you, uh, want to freshen up
or catch a bit of shut-eye,

33:52.499 --> 33:54.767
you can use my suite.
I've heard there's a shower

33:54.835 --> 33:56.969
in there and everything.
Is that true?

33:57.037 --> 33:58.938
Yeah, well, I don't know
about "everything,"

33:59.006 --> 34:00.640
but, uh, I've never
had any complaints.

34:03.043 --> 34:05.445
Let me give you the grand tour.

34:20.393 --> 34:24.297
I can't believe I'm doing this.

34:24.364 --> 34:26.431
So...

34:26.500 --> 34:28.101
what was the negotiation like?

34:28.168 --> 34:30.937
What did, uh, Bud Hammond say?

34:35.775 --> 34:37.476
You remember the night
of the Garcetti nomination,

34:37.543 --> 34:39.011
when you made that pass at me,

34:39.079 --> 34:40.513
and I said you were
a gross douche bag,

34:40.581 --> 34:42.248
and I wouldn't sleep with you
even if you were

34:42.315 --> 34:44.250
the last douche on the planet?
Mm.

34:44.318 --> 34:46.284
I was lying about
the "sleep with" part.

34:56.329 --> 34:57.896
Are you still seeing your boss?

34:57.964 --> 34:59.765
You're not gonna say
anything to him about this?

34:59.832 --> 35:01.633
I applied a couple times
for a job at the <i>Globe</i>

35:01.701 --> 35:03.502
and I wouldn't want to ruin
my chances of... Gary.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.871
Seriously. Shut up.

35:10.343 --> 35:12.244
We were supposed to rehearse.

35:12.312 --> 35:13.412
You ditched me.
Don't stress.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.080
I can play this
with my eyes closed.

35:15.148 --> 35:17.182
"Second Time Around" though?

35:17.250 --> 35:19.117
I don't want Dougie to get
all pissed off at me.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.554
Well, it's a second stab at his
engagement party, so it fits.

35:22.622 --> 35:24.056
Nice save.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.357
You know all the lyrics?

35:25.425 --> 35:27.759
Where's my check,
you little shit?

35:27.827 --> 35:30.028
Did you forge my
name and cash it?

35:30.096 --> 35:31.797
For how much?

35:34.100 --> 35:37.536
No, I...
I couldn't...

35:37.603 --> 35:38.837
I'm sorry.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.007
Look, I-I can explain...

35:42.075 --> 35:44.009
No, you don't have to explain.

35:44.077 --> 35:46.144
Yesterday, when
you bailed on me,

35:46.212 --> 35:47.646
I didn't tell you
the whole story

35:47.714 --> 35:49.981
about the horn player.

35:50.049 --> 35:52.084
That was your
grandfather, T.J.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.685
You never said
he was a musician.

35:53.753 --> 35:55.020
Well, he was when we met.

35:55.088 --> 35:58.223
That was before
the booze, and...

35:58.291 --> 36:00.158
before the heroin.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.994
I left him right after
your mother was born.

36:03.062 --> 36:04.696
Even I knew that
that was no environment

36:04.764 --> 36:06.798
to bring a kid up in.

36:06.866 --> 36:10.235
Not long after that,

36:10.303 --> 36:12.738
he got beat up trying
to score some drugs.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.408
They split his lip
in two places,

36:16.476 --> 36:19.077
and knocked out
all his front teeth.

36:19.145 --> 36:21.713
His embouchure.

36:21.781 --> 36:24.082
After that, he was washed up.

36:24.150 --> 36:26.318
They found him about
five years later,

36:26.386 --> 36:28.086
in some fleabag motel.

36:28.154 --> 36:29.821
Dead.

36:29.889 --> 36:32.023
So you don't have to
explain to me

36:32.091 --> 36:34.259
why you stole from me, honey.

36:34.327 --> 36:36.895
I know your story.

36:36.963 --> 36:39.097
I know how it ends.

36:41.801 --> 36:44.569
But if you ever
steal from me again,

36:44.637 --> 36:46.037
I swear to God

36:46.105 --> 36:47.839
I will never speak to you

36:47.907 --> 36:49.775
as long as I live.

36:49.842 --> 36:52.244
Have you got that?

36:56.015 --> 36:57.449
Okay.

36:57.517 --> 37:00.719
We should get dressed,
we got people coming.

37:00.787 --> 37:02.754
I want to run it once
before they get here.

37:02.822 --> 37:04.689
I don't want to screw up later.

37:08.545 --> 37:09.679
Please say it's delicious.

37:09.747 --> 37:11.114
Mmm. You're delicious.

37:11.181 --> 37:13.116
Stop.

37:15.619 --> 37:17.520
Anne.

37:17.588 --> 37:19.489
You look absolutely stunning.

37:19.556 --> 37:21.057
Oh.

37:21.125 --> 37:23.726
Mom, could I talk to you
for a second? Sure.

37:23.794 --> 37:25.194
Excuse us.
Yeah.

37:25.262 --> 37:26.796
Um...

37:26.864 --> 37:29.232
Look, I meant what
I said yesterday

37:29.299 --> 37:33.469
about how difficult
this is going to be.

37:33.537 --> 37:35.738
But if anyone can
pull it off, you can.

37:35.806 --> 37:38.074
Way to go, Mr. President!

37:40.244 --> 37:42.044
Great to be back home!

37:42.112 --> 37:45.481
Oh, Anne, you are a vision.

37:49.452 --> 37:51.753
Hey, Dougie, get over here
and give ol' pappy a hug.

37:51.821 --> 37:53.422
And not one of your
pussy hugs, neither.

37:53.489 --> 37:57.025
A real hug. Come on.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.261
Oh.

37:59.329 --> 38:01.129
Hey, I am so proud

38:01.197 --> 38:03.599
of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.

38:05.335 --> 38:06.501
Sugar.

38:06.569 --> 38:08.270
Bud.

38:08.338 --> 38:13.642
âª There are those who bet

38:13.710 --> 38:17.112
âª Love comes but once

38:17.180 --> 38:19.548
âª And yet

38:19.616 --> 38:26.021
âª I'm oh so glad we met

38:26.089 --> 38:32.561
âª The second time around.

38:45.841 --> 38:47.808
Come on, sugar.

38:57.953 --> 38:59.987
Nice job yesterday.

39:00.055 --> 39:02.089
Couldn't have done it
without you.

39:02.157 --> 39:03.791
No. You couldn't have.

39:03.859 --> 39:06.660
But you could've
done it without me,

39:06.728 --> 39:09.263
which got me thinking.

39:09.331 --> 39:11.332
When you making
the announcement?

39:11.400 --> 39:14.001
About Garcetti.

39:14.069 --> 39:15.302
Now, don't worry, baby.

39:15.370 --> 39:17.171
I'm not gonna say anything.

39:17.239 --> 39:19.039
I sent you because I knew

39:19.107 --> 39:20.841
you would bring
those journalists home.

39:20.909 --> 39:25.212
And maybe get my numbers
boosted a little in the process.

39:25.280 --> 39:28.649
Come on, baby, it's me talking.

39:28.717 --> 39:30.317
Just say it.

39:30.385 --> 39:32.887
Mmm? Say the words.

39:34.156 --> 39:36.123
Yes, Bud.

39:36.191 --> 39:38.692
I am going to
run for president.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.128
Without you.

39:52.339 --> 39:54.574
I know you said
to give you space,

39:54.642 --> 39:56.676
but I-I had to talk
to you, sugar.

39:56.744 --> 39:59.278
If you want to continue this
conversation, Donald Hammond,

39:59.346 --> 40:00.613
tell me something true.

40:01.915 --> 40:04.050
And I mean

40:04.118 --> 40:06.519
something that is true now,

40:06.587 --> 40:09.622
and will still be true
in five years,

40:09.690 --> 40:11.858
and in 15 years

40:11.925 --> 40:13.660
and in 50.

40:13.727 --> 40:16.095
Can you do that?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.500
You should leave me.

40:22.269 --> 40:24.170
I'll cheat again.

40:24.238 --> 40:26.139
And I'll lie again,

40:26.206 --> 40:28.908
and I'll break
your heart again.

40:30.711 --> 40:34.247
Retain Stacy Phillips.

40:34.314 --> 40:37.183
Uh, you have to come out
of this looking good.

40:37.251 --> 40:39.852
You'll get no flak
from me, Elaine.

40:40.988 --> 40:42.388
I'm not leaving.

40:42.456 --> 40:44.457
You swore an oath

40:44.525 --> 40:46.826
to the Chief Justice

40:46.894 --> 40:49.462
with your hand on the Bible.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.499
And this ring...

40:53.567 --> 40:56.669
sat there on the Bible.

40:57.337 --> 41:01.440
And in that moment,
I became First Wife.

41:01.508 --> 41:03.909
I married the nation.

41:07.414 --> 41:09.782
I will be in the
Lincoln bedroom

41:09.849 --> 41:12.418
until further notice.

41:12.485 --> 41:15.587
Put me on your calendar
in the morning

41:15.655 --> 41:17.890
to figure out

41:17.957 --> 41:21.160
how we're gonna talk to
the boys about Sarah Latham.

41:27.266 --> 41:29.667
This reminds me of dancing
at our first inaugural.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.371
We took lessons for a month,

41:33.439 --> 41:35.273
and you hit on the instructor.

41:35.341 --> 41:37.275
Come on, sugar,

41:37.343 --> 41:38.910
do you only remember
the bad parts?

41:38.978 --> 41:41.279
Or do you remember
the good times, too?

41:41.347 --> 41:43.648
I remember all of it.

41:43.716 --> 41:45.517
âª Let 'em laugh, let 'em frown

41:45.584 --> 41:47.952
âª You know I'll love you
till the moon's upside down... âª

41:48.020 --> 41:49.954
<i>It was a triumphant day
for the former president.</i>

41:50.022 --> 41:51.589
<i>No, I don't mean</i>
<i>the three American lives</i>

41:51.657 --> 41:53.691
<i>he negotiated for in Turkey.</i>

41:53.759 --> 41:55.860
<i>Bud's most artful</i>
<i>act of diplomacy</i>

41:55.928 --> 41:58.763
<i>took place at home</i>
<i>with his ex-wife.</i>

41:58.831 --> 42:00.431
<i>Somehow he managed to</i>
<i>negotiate his way</i>

42:00.499 --> 42:02.267
<i>back into her good graces.</i>

42:02.334 --> 42:04.369
<i>But the day belongs to</i>

42:04.436 --> 42:06.704
<i>Secretary of State</i>
<i>Elaine Barrish.</i>

42:06.772 --> 42:08.573
<i>With the White House</i>
<i>intransigent,</i>

42:08.641 --> 42:10.842
<i>the Secretary placed one of</i>
<i>the larger political bets</i>

42:10.910 --> 42:12.443
<i>we have ever witnessed</i>
<i>on the table...</i>

42:12.511 --> 42:15.747
<i>she bet it all on a man</i>
<i>who's spent a lifetime</i>

42:15.814 --> 42:17.916
<i>violating her trust</i>

42:17.983 --> 42:20.251
<i>and publicly humiliating her.</i>

42:20.319 --> 42:22.153
<i>I've written a lot</i>
<i>about Elaine Barrish</i>

42:22.221 --> 42:23.922
<i>in this paper over the years.</i>

42:23.989 --> 42:27.091
<i>I've criticized her</i>
<i>for just about everything:</i>

42:27.159 --> 42:28.660
<i>fom her policies,</i>
<i>to her marriage,</i>

42:28.727 --> 42:31.062
<i>to her motives, to her hair.</i>

42:31.130 --> 42:33.498
<i>I was right about the hair,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

42:34.633 --> 42:37.435
âª Why try to change me?

42:37.503 --> 42:40.838
<i>I've written a lot of
things about Elaine Barrish,</i>

42:41.906 --> 42:43.807
<i>except "thank you."</i>

42:43.875 --> 42:45.142
<i>I've never written that.</i>

42:45.210 --> 42:47.611
<i>Until today.</i>

42:57.689 --> 42:59.623
Why are you telling me this?

42:59.691 --> 43:01.491
Why?
Because if I don't kill this now,

43:01.559 --> 43:02.826
it'll start all over again.

43:02.894 --> 43:04.294
My parents, they have
spent their lives

43:04.362 --> 43:06.730
putting the country
before our family.

43:06.798 --> 43:08.398
Somebody has to
put our family first.

43:08.466 --> 43:10.968
We can't take another run.
We won't survive it.

43:11.035 --> 43:12.803
I can't print this without
confirmation. Find it.

43:12.870 --> 43:15.806
My mother is
going to run again,

43:15.873 --> 43:17.841
against Garcetti.

43:17.909 --> 43:19.710
I'm sorry,
that's all I can tell you.
