She was so full of hope.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.928
Wanted to imprint this stamp of positivity
on the world.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.893
I couldn't let anything happen to her.

19:12.068 --> 19:15.026
After all the death and destruction
I've been responsible for...

19:15.196 --> 19:17.983
...Lana was my chance at redemption,
so I tracked her down.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.949
-When you found her, what was she doing?
-lnvestigating LuthorCorp.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.077
I told her to put it in the past,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.533
So I joined her cause.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.247
To keep an eye on her.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.409
And I got this job on the inside,
feeding Lana information...

19:31.587 --> 19:36.297
...while I advised Tess Mercer
on defense-contract strategies.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.711
Did Lana contact anyone else
when she was in Metropolis?

19:43.057 --> 19:44.422
A blond woman.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.057

-Sul|ivan.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.963
Still looking. Just like you.

Only I'm trying to ﬁnd the technology

I'm just trying to make a fantasy a reality.

Luthor dead and not end up dead yourself?

22:55.791 --> 22:58.624
How could you not tell me

23:00.004 --> 23:01.744
Because she asked me not to.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.958
I have to respect that.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.959
Well, now it looks like your respect
may have gotten her kidnapped.

Ifl had known, I could have stopped her

she didn't come back to see me.

Speaking of which, does your short stay
include a pit stop at the Planet to see Clark?

24:30.886 --> 24:32.046
Not this time.

But I read about the red-blue blur

there's more to your trip back home...

to genetically enhance injured soldiers?

Using alien DNA.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.966
This is all in the past.

Yeah, turns out the project was mothballed
even before Lex went missing.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.722

26:12.404 --> 26:13.735
Since she came clean with me.

She told me when Lana made that disc...

26:15.908 --> 26:18.274
...she was being held at gunpoint
by Lex's men.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.363
Wait, Clark.

26:20.663 --> 26:24.076
If Lana didn't make that disc on her own,
why didn't she come home to you?

planning her revenge on Lex.

like to live dangerously close to the edge.

when you're clad in an invincible suit.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.973
I didn't put the suit on for protection.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.636
I did it so that I could actually do
some good in the world.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.986
You are an amazing woman, Tess.

37:23.617 --> 37:27.656
But it's hard to see when you're stuck
in the dark shadow of an even darker man.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.320
Why do you think I want Lex gone?

37:33.168 --> 37:35.955
You may have gotten rid
of the microchip...

37:36.671 --> 37:40.539
...but every second
that you are consumed by hate...

37:40.717 --> 37:44.505
...is another second
Lex is still in control of you.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.098
Don't be a victim anymore.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.881
Kent, what are you doing
rising before the roosters?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.883
Couldn't sleep.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.554
LANA:
Clark.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.844
Meet me up on the roof.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.977
Lana?

38:43.279 --> 38:46.237
I've been looking all over for you.
Are you okay?

38:46.408 --> 38:47.898
I've never felt better, Clark.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.067
It's because you're wearing that suit,
Lana.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.407
You have powers.

38:53.581 --> 38:56.072
And the last time that happened,
it didn't end well.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.116
I'm different now.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.077
This time I've prepared myself.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.586
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

39:06.302 --> 39:08.759
You would have never let me
go through with it.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.046
Because it's dangerous, Lana.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.260
It's never been tested on humans.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.972
Give Lex credit where credit is due.

...he's pulled off the impossible
on more than one occasion.

39:22.610 --> 39:26.728
Clark, you don't
have to protect me anymore.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.567
You don't have to worry about me.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.698
How can you say that, Lana?

39:30.869 --> 39:33.861
-We have no idea what's gonna happen.
-Exactly.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.531
And that's why it's so important
to live in the present.

39:38.877 --> 39:43.086
Whatever happened in the past,
and whatever happens in the future...

39:43.256 --> 39:44.371
...it doesn't matter.

39:44.549 --> 39:48.041
It does matter, Lana.
It matters if you get hurt.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.674
I know how much you care about me.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.428
You always have.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.145
That's why when I came back
for Chloe's wedding...

40:04.652 --> 40:07.268
...I didn't think we could be together.

40:07.614 --> 40:13.484
Clark, the last thing I wanted
was to be some distraction in your life.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.652
You're not a distraction.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.288
You never were.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.498
I'm not anymore.

40:27.175 --> 40:31.088
Clark, nothing can hurt me anymore.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.422
You and I are equals now.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.462
And together...

40:34.766 --> 40:37.257
...we can help make the world
a better place.

40:44.818 --> 40:48.686
-Unless that's not what you want.
-No, Lana, it's exactly what I want.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.948
But it's a dream, Lana.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.360
We both know
dreams normally don't come true.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.332
There's never been anything normal
about us.
