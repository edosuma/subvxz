about again?

00:09.920 --> 00:12.290
I will download

Freddie, you've seen it
six times.

00:19.380 --> 00:21.580
But every time's
like the first time!

00:21.580 --> 00:23.750
Seriously?
Six times?

my eighth time.

He's never loved anything
this much.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.330
That's not true.
I love corduroy.

I did?
Yeah, I did!

03:04.460 --> 03:08.670
Our doubts are traitors,
and make us lose the good
we oft might win,

03:08.670 --> 03:10.580

For a 14-year-old boy,

how did you do that?

07:20.670 --> 07:24.080
(chuckling) Well...
something's different.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.120
This is nano-dex.
It's a smart fabric

natural muscle movement.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.790

-Impressive.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.080
So great, Hiro!

07:31.080 --> 07:32.790

the Human Fist.

07:32.790 --> 07:34.880
By day, he's just
a big hand.

But at night,
the glove! Goes! On!

08:11.790 --> 08:14.170
Sit. Down.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.830

Nothing, uh--
It, uh, it, uh, slipped.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.960
That was not a slip.
That was a throw.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.420
Back me up here, people.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.500
-Definitely a throw.
-He threw it so hard.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.250
-See?
-All right, all right,
everyone, that's enough!

08:32.250 --> 08:34.040
Karmi, are you all right?

08:34.040 --> 08:36.080
Yes, Professor Granville.

-I'll be fine.
-Good. Mr. Hamada,

08:38.880 --> 08:41.540
are you done
destroying school property?

08:41.540 --> 08:43.500
I hope so.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.500
(groans)

08:55.500 --> 08:58.040
Hiro! You totally
did that on purpose!

08:58.040 --> 08:59.420
No, it wa-- it was an accident.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.880
An accident?
This doesn't look like
an accident to me.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.750
Definitely on purpose.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.420
-Here-- Aah!
-(crash)

09:05.420 --> 09:07.040
Ugh!
What is going on with you?

09:07.040 --> 09:11.500
Nothing!
That table must've been, uh,
cracked, because that's

09:11.500 --> 09:15.420
the only logical explanation
for why it would break
like that, right?

09:15.420 --> 09:16.620
Yeah, it was-- it was cracked.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.210
You are cracked!

Come on!

09:31.710 --> 09:35.000
Ew! Uh, Hiro?
What are you doing?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.080
Nano-dex.
Won't come off.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.380
Here, lemme try.

09:41.170 --> 09:43.460
Yep. (grunting)

09:43.460 --> 09:46.290
It's (grunt) really on there.

Weirdest thing.

Ow! Okay!
This is not my day.

09:54.210 --> 09:57.290

-Seems like this
might be a problem.

09:59.080 --> 10:03.080
Ugh, super strength,
such an obvious choice.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.580
Yeah, I woulda gone
with laser eyes.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.880

10:06.880 --> 10:07.920
Aah!

10:07.920 --> 10:10.750
-(crash)
-Show off.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.670
I bet you'd like
a sticker.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.830
Stop talking.

Nano-compression circuitry.
Impressive. Pity he rushed it.

10:22.170 --> 10:25.500
Baymax:
The nano-dex appears
to be malfunctioning.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.040
I know!
But every time I try
to pull it off,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.120
it just gets tighter.

10:30.120 --> 10:32.960
(gasps)
Maybe you could short out
the circuitry?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.380
Uh-- Use your
defibrillator hands.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.330
I am concerned
about your safety.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.380
I'm insulated.
It's fine.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.830
Clear.

10:42.830 --> 10:45.500
(Hiro screams)

10:45.500 --> 10:48.670
Well, I wanted
a superpower, and now
I can't get rid of it.

10:48.670 --> 10:49.880
My caregiving matrix

10:49.880 --> 10:50.960
is not equipped to deal

10:50.960 --> 10:52.000
with this problem.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.880
Maybe if I really concentrate

10:53.880 --> 10:55.330
and take it slow,
I can control it.

10:56.330 --> 10:58.120
Yeah, it-- it's working!

10:58.120 --> 10:59.420
-Heh-- Look at--
-(smash)

10:59.420 --> 11:00.790

-(thud)
-I'm gonna switch you
to decaf, Mochi.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.250
Come on, Baymax,
let's go to Fred's house.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.960
Maybe he knows some...
comic book way
out of this.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.210
-That seems unlikely.
-Desperate times.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.330
(door opens,
closes)

11:13.330 --> 11:16.000
-More coffee?
-You're too kind.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.620
How do you like
that blueberry scone?

11:17.620 --> 11:19.960
Delightfully... fruitful.

11:21.290 --> 11:22.960
Well, they're... in season.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.080
Yummy. (slurping)

11:26.080 --> 11:28.500
(exhales) Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.460
Sorry, my friend,
this is unprecedented
in the comic book multi-verse.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.120
And I'm pretty familiar.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.750
Ugh... unbelievable.

11:35.750 --> 11:36.960
(phone rings)

11:36.960 --> 11:38.500
I need to take this.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.120
Is it ready?
Is it ready?
Is it ready?

11:41.120 --> 11:43.670
It's ready!
Ow! Still in pain,
but it's ready!

11:43.670 --> 11:46.830
I'm on my way!
Yeah! I need to excuse myself,
just for a bit.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.790
Stay as long as you want,
but I gotta go, bye!

11:48.790 --> 11:51.540
-Ah!
-Great news, Fred!

11:51.540 --> 11:53.830
Wait a minute,
you're not my son.

11:53.830 --> 11:57.580
-Or my wife!
-Uh, heh, no.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm Hiro,

11:57.580 --> 11:59.540
Mr. Frederickson.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.960
I guess I should go.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.120
Hold it!
Hold it right there.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.000
What's that you've got
up your sleeve?

12:05.000 --> 12:08.120
This?
W-- Well, uh, I call it
nano-dex.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.120
Heh-- It's a smart fabric
that can contract to--

12:10.120 --> 12:13.500
Enhance natural
muscle movement. Genius!

12:13.500 --> 12:16.620
Well, not quite genius,
I can't get it off.

12:16.620 --> 12:19.790
Classic!
I tried to give myself
super strength

12:19.790 --> 12:21.420
when I was a rookie hero, too.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.750
-You did.
-Yep. Until I realized,
you don't have to be strong.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.290
You just have to find
your true strength.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.500
I'm not sure I follow.

12:30.500 --> 12:35.250
Well, in my case,
my true strength was
my can-do attitude.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.250
And having truckloads of cash
didn't hurt, either.

12:38.250 --> 12:42.420
Right. Huh.
I guess I don't know
what my true strength is.

12:42.420 --> 12:46.670
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But you know, right now,
you should leave.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.460
-(siren blaring)
-I didn't recognize
you at first,

12:48.460 --> 12:50.120
so I alerted security.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
They'll be there any second.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.120
Go Go:
Why did Fred want us
to meet him here?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.080
I don't know, but he was
acting strange earlier.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.120
Stranger than his usual strange.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.500
I wonder where he is?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.710
(booming splashes)

13:02.710 --> 13:04.080
What is that?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.420
Hm?

13:05.420 --> 13:06.580
Ah!

13:08.580 --> 13:11.330
(booming splashes)

13:23.670 --> 13:26.290
(growling)

13:26.290 --> 13:29.120
Uh, are you guys seeing
what I'm seeing?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.040
You mean the giant lizard
that just came out of the water?

13:32.040 --> 13:34.210
Oh, good.
You see it, too.

13:39.330 --> 13:40.500
Ta-dah!

13:40.500 --> 13:41.670
Freddie?

13:41.670 --> 13:43.290
Oh, what did you do?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.290
Oh, I paid to have
a one-to-one scale replica

13:45.290 --> 13:47.830
of the Kentucky Kaiju
made out of a giant crane,

13:47.830 --> 13:48.960
obviously.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.000
Oh, yeah, sure.
Of course.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.040
Because that makes sense!

13:53.040 --> 13:55.540
Look at it!
Isn't it glorious?

13:55.540 --> 13:58.210
-Hiro:
It is pretty cool.
-Worth every penny.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.620
Go Go:
Okay, what do you plan on doing
with a giant lizard?

14:00.620 --> 14:03.040
Well, I hadn't really
thought that through,
but, I mean, there's plenty

14:03.040 --> 14:05.620
I'm sure, I-- oww!

14:05.620 --> 14:07.080
Howdy and hello!

14:08.880 --> 14:12.580
Ho-ho! This is just like
when the Human Fist
got laser eyes!

14:12.580 --> 14:14.290
It was kind of a stretch,
looking back.

14:14.290 --> 14:15.790
You know,
'cause he was a hand,

14:15.790 --> 14:17.920
and hands don't have eyes.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.040
Jeepers!
You sure do talk a lot.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.460
-Aah!
-I have got you.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.500
Thanks for
the swell gizmo, mister.

14:31.210 --> 14:34.080
-Oh, this is not good.
-He's heading toward
the city.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.420
We've got to stop him!

14:35.420 --> 14:37.290
I'm calling Skymax.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.960
Ugh!

14:38.960 --> 14:40.250
Yeah.
I'll call.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.920
(phone
beeping)

14:58.250 --> 15:00.460
Can... someone help me
get dressed?

15:02.500 --> 15:07.120
-(stomping)
-(screaming)

15:12.040 --> 15:14.330

15:14.330 --> 15:17.330

Wasabi:
Did you have to do the fire?

15:39.290 --> 15:41.120
Fred:
I was going for accuracy.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.880
Of course now,
I regret that decision.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.210
Fred:
Ahh!

15:49.040 --> 15:51.330
-Fred, you alive?
-Uh-huh, yeah.

15:51.330 --> 15:54.170
I think I should just
lay here for a while.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.330
(grunts)

15:58.460 --> 15:59.670

16:05.620 --> 16:07.380
Ah!

16:07.380 --> 16:08.790
Ahh!

16:08.790 --> 16:12.210
-Oh, come on!
-Hiro, we're out
of firepower down here.

16:12.210 --> 16:13.710
Hiro:
Copy that.
Baymax and I are on it!

16:13.710 --> 16:15.290
(roaring)

16:18.250 --> 16:19.330
(roaring)

16:19.330 --> 16:21.210
Hiro: Baymax?
Rocket fist!

16:23.830 --> 16:25.250
Baymax:
He ate it.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.170
-Oh, no!
-(smash)

16:28.170 --> 16:29.710
Baymax:
Oh, no.

16:32.210 --> 16:36.120
Baymax? (grunt)
Baymax! Are you okay?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.960
My systems
are not responding.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.170
I cannot move.

16:39.170 --> 16:41.540
(growling)

16:41.540 --> 16:43.500
Wait here, buddy.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.460
Hiro...
I will not be able
to have your back.

16:46.460 --> 16:49.290
Don't worry.
Got super strength, remember?

16:50.960 --> 16:54.330
(growling)

16:54.330 --> 16:56.620
(roaring)

17:03.170 --> 17:05.210
(grunting)

17:14.960 --> 17:19.500
(screams)

17:21.580 --> 17:22.920
(grunt)

17:25.420 --> 17:27.120
Ah! Ah!

17:42.290 --> 17:44.080
Wait, where's Noodle Burger Boy?

17:44.080 --> 17:47.580
Hoo boy!
Looks like you
have your hands full, mister!

17:47.580 --> 17:49.830
Have a tasty day!

17:49.830 --> 17:51.460
Who's driving this thing?

17:51.460 --> 17:52.620
(gasps)

17:56.540 --> 17:58.380
(groaning)

17:58.380 --> 18:01.580
(roaring)

18:01.580 --> 18:04.420
-I can't look!
-Come on, Hiro!

18:05.460 --> 18:07.290
(Hiro screams)

18:10.620 --> 18:11.620
Aah!

18:12.620 --> 18:14.460
(groans)

18:14.460 --> 18:17.170
(roaring)

18:19.830 --> 18:24.290
(grunting)

18:24.290 --> 18:26.500
(roaring)

18:26.500 --> 18:27.540
(grunt)

18:27.540 --> 18:29.960
(roaring)

18:29.960 --> 18:32.170
(breathing heavily)

18:32.170 --> 18:35.330
Oh, no!
Of course!
Now it comes off!

18:37.000 --> 18:40.460
(roaring)

18:43.040 --> 18:44.620
Fred's Dad:
You don't have to be strong.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.920
You just have to find
your true strength.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.540
(roaring)

18:57.290 --> 18:58.500
All:
No!

19:07.120 --> 19:11.120
(growling)

19:16.290 --> 19:20.210
Okay, you win.
Just, please...
don't hurt me.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.750
Whoops... should've told you
to watch your step.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.540
(howling)

19:50.880 --> 19:52.580
(grunting)

19:52.580 --> 19:54.670
You were amazing, Hiro!

19:54.670 --> 19:56.960
Seriously!
You saved our butts out there!

19:56.960 --> 20:00.040
Boy Genius
is definitely your thing.

20:00.040 --> 20:04.290
Ugh! Wow.
I just had this crazy dream.

20:04.290 --> 20:08.120
I was caught
by the Kentucky Kaiju.
Also, laser eyes.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.580
Fred, that really did happen.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.420
Oh... right.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.710
Wow.

20:15.710 --> 20:20.080
Guys, seriously, sorry
I inadvertently created
a monster

20:20.080 --> 20:21.710
that almost destroyed
the city.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.120
-(thud)
-Whoa ouch!

20:23.120 --> 20:24.710
But in my defense,

20:24.710 --> 20:26.790
who woulda thought it could
cause mayhem and destruction?

20:26.790 --> 20:29.290
Everyone, Fred. Everyone.

20:32.290 --> 20:34.620
Baymax:
Hiro, is something wrong?

20:34.620 --> 20:38.000
-What is that?
-It's an incredibly
advanced CPU.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.620
This must be what
switched the Kaiju
into battle mode.

20:40.620 --> 20:41.790
Where did it come from?

20:41.790 --> 20:43.960
Noodle Burger Boy
must've installed it,

20:43.960 --> 20:46.540
but I doubt
he could've made this.

20:46.540 --> 20:50.000
Yeah.
This is way beyond
his robo-burger brain.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.500
And something else
has been bothering me.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.500
-Globby.
-Now let's see how you do
without Big Red.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.670
Hiro:
He didn't actually
steal anything from the bank.

20:59.670 --> 21:02.420
You're right.
That was weird.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.380
He wasn't trying
to get into the vault.

21:04.380 --> 21:07.080
It's a good thing
you've got friends
with firepower, kid,

21:07.080 --> 21:09.540
'cause you're useless
without 'em!

21:09.540 --> 21:11.880
He was tryin' to get in my head.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.540
Someone else
was behind this.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.670
But who?

21:16.790 --> 21:18.670
That's what I need to know.

21:19.960 --> 21:23.960
Well, I wanted to find out
just how smart this boy is.

21:25.620 --> 21:27.620
I'll bite, how smart is he?

21:27.620 --> 21:31.460
(chuckles) Very.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.580
(theme music playing)
