01:51.625 --> 01:53.423
Don't tell me how well you fight,

01:53.958 --> 01:55.380
or how great your teacher is,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.843
or brag about your style.

01:58.667 --> 01:59.919
Kungfu -

02:00.458 --> 02:01.630
two words.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.127
Horizontal. Vertical.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.094
Make a mistake - horizontal.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.877
Stay standing and you win.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.964
Isn't that right?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.676
<THE GRANDMASTER>

05:50.208 --> 05:52.006
We're from Foshan.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.422
My father ran the family business.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.253
He exported goods to Hong Kong.

05:57.167 --> 05:59.340
The Ips have a long history in Foshan.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.005
They named a street after us.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.801
That's how wealthy we were.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.677
Before I turned 40, life was easy.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.843
I lived off my family money.

06:10.917 --> 06:12.260
I had only one passion.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.675
At seven, I started learning kungfu.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.169
My master was Chan Wah-shun.

06:18.333 --> 06:21.007
Foshan's Wing Chun began with Leung Jan.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.835
I'm the third generation.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.427
When I started, my master was seventy.

06:27.042 --> 06:28.276
The day I became a disciple,

06:28.311 --> 06:29.510
he tied the sash himself.

06:30.833 --> 06:34.007
This sash stands for school and teacher.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.460
It stands for honor.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.796
You are now a martial artist.

06:39.917 --> 06:42.545
You must live your life with honor.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.377
One sash, an unbroken tradition.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.298
I lived through dynastic times,

06:47.458 --> 06:50.177
the early republic, warlords,

06:50.250 --> 06:51.923
Japanese invasion and civil war.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.877
Finally, I came to Hong Kong.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.585
What kept me going

06:55.708 --> 06:58.461
was the martial arts code of honor.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.301
My wife, Zhang Yongcheng,

07:04.875 --> 07:07.298
was the descendant of an Imperial Minister.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.547
She was a woman of few words

07:09.750 --> 07:11.593
because she knew their power.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.961
We understood each other well.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.380
She loved music.

07:46.708 --> 07:49.052
I'd take her to hear opera.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.590
People were so conservative back then.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.844
Nice women didn't visit places like this.

07:55.542 --> 07:56.964
But gossip didn't bother her.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.669
When I went out, she lit a lamp

08:37.292 --> 08:40.171
and left it lit till I came home.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.173
If life has seasons,

10:24.792 --> 10:27.466
my first forty years were spring.

10:30.833 --> 10:34.883
(1936. Foshan, Guangdong Province.)

10:36.000 --> 10:37.548
In 1936, Foshan

10:37.583 --> 10:39.085
was a prosperous city.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.627
Life was peaceful and good.

10:41.167 --> 10:44.091
Back then, men socialised in brothels.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.086
Such places were popular in the South.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.876
Foshan's finest was Republic House.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.048
Its walls were covered in gold,

10:53.250 --> 10:54.718
so we called it the Gold Pavilion.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.961
It was the first to have an elevator.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.343
Enter a prince, exit a pauper.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.385
You'd spend money like water.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.761
It was like a social club for martial artists.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.924
Good men can be found among rogues.

11:11.875 --> 11:15.254
And hidden masters too.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.710
<i>People saw it as a pleasure palace.</i>

11:20.375 --> 11:21.718
But to us,

11:22.667 --> 11:24.169
it was a battleground.

12:05.792 --> 12:09.501
I claim three accomplishments in life.

12:09.833 --> 12:12.837
First, I united Xingyi and Bagua styles.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.923
Second, I became the director

12:16.000 --> 12:18.469
of the Northern Martial Arts Union,

12:19.167 --> 12:23.343
bringing together Tongbei, Cannon Fist,

12:23.417 --> 12:25.761
Tai Chi, Yan Qing and other schools.

12:26.833 --> 12:32.090
Third, I took the northern masters south.

12:32.458 --> 12:33.926
In 1929,

12:34.208 --> 12:36.711
the First Southern Martial Arts Academy

12:37.208 --> 12:38.835
was founded under my supervision

12:39.000 --> 12:43.801
after talks here in the Gold Pavilion.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.672
I'm getting old.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.048
It's time for new blood.

12:48.333 --> 12:52.463
I held a retirement ceremony up North.

12:52.542 --> 12:58.049
You invited me to hold a second one here.

12:59.917 --> 13:06.084
It's my farewell to my southern comrades.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.048
Up North, the one who took part

13:10.375 --> 13:12.844
was my top disciple, Ma San.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.085
He'll be my successor.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.002
Please give him your support.

13:22.833 --> 13:26.758
I'd always wanted

13:27.250 --> 13:30.094
to take the southern styles north.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.585
Sadly, my time's up.

13:34.417 --> 13:39.253
I want to hold a demonstration match

13:40.667 --> 13:43.546
with a southern martial artist.

13:46.167 --> 13:48.169
Someone you all support.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.343
Pick one.

14:06.750 --> 14:09.094
Think you're good enough

14:10.042 --> 14:12.010
to challenge the Old Master?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.127
Let's keep it simple.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.384
<i>I'll take you all on.</i>

14:20.419 --> 14:21.968
Get him!

14:49.667 --> 14:52.090
That at the ceremony up North,

14:52.250 --> 14:53.502
I had the honor.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.129
To worship at the feet of the Buddha

14:58.750 --> 15:00.343
first pass the Guardian of the Gate.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.752
That's me.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.965
How can I represent the South?

15:12.250 --> 15:13.672
The southern schools

15:14.208 --> 15:16.006
are Hung, Lau, Choy, Lee, and Mok.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.675
In rank,

15:18.375 --> 15:20.127
you are all my seniors.

15:20.417 --> 15:21.964
You're the leaders and masters.

15:22.458 --> 15:23.798
I have no standing.

15:23.833 --> 15:27.417
The reputation of the South is at stake.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.940
We Southerners

15:29.975 --> 15:31.673
may be petty,

15:31.833 --> 15:33.938
but we don't run away from a fight.

15:33.973 --> 15:36.044
We're not afraid of these Northerners!

15:36.079 --> 15:37.635
This is a challenge.

15:37.875 --> 15:39.092
We will rise to it.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.334
Isn't that right?

15:40.369 --> 15:41.645
Absolutely!

15:41.680 --> 15:42.922
It must be you.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.593
<i>I'll take the kids to my mother's.</i>

16:19.750 --> 16:21.343
Less for you to worry about.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.426
When a man reaches forty,

16:24.667 --> 16:26.669
he needs to be sure of things.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.380
When it's all over,

16:30.167 --> 16:31.635
come pick us up.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.752
Do you know

16:48.500 --> 16:50.343
why a knife must have a sheath?

16:51.250 --> 16:54.504
Its power lies not in sharpness,

16:55.417 --> 16:56.715
but in concealment.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.897
You're too sharp a blade.

16:58.932 --> 17:01.045
You have to stay put.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.510
My sheath

17:03.708 --> 17:05.190
is you, Master.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.759
With you around,

17:06.794 --> 17:08.257
I'm under control.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.794
I can no longer control you.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.843
You're too anxious to make your mark.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.844
For now, leave Foshan.

17:15.878 --> 17:17.210
Miss that train,

17:17.875 --> 17:19.343
<i>and I'll break your legs.</i>

17:26.041 --> 17:27.419
Central News:

17:27.500 --> 17:29.440
Southern armies

17:29.475 --> 17:31.381
marched north

17:31.500 --> 17:35.084
claiming for autonomy.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.252
The Central Army blocked their advance.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.752
The situation is explosive.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.134
Halt!

17:56.750 --> 17:58.252
Let us pass.

17:58.333 --> 18:00.961
Sorry. This street is closed off.

18:01.333 --> 18:04.007
No one bearing arms can enter.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.551
Do you know who's in that rickshaw?

18:06.833 --> 18:09.916
Call out the Gong Family disciples!

18:13.792 --> 18:15.419
Miss Gong, it's good you're here.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.751
He must call this off.
Win or lose, it's a disgrace.

18:18.786 --> 18:20.377
My father has never lost.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.377
There's no question of losing.

18:22.583 --> 18:25.712
And so what if he wins?

18:26.042 --> 18:27.523
They'll say he beat a nobody.

18:27.558 --> 18:29.005
Ip Man's not at his level.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.502
Where's my father?

18:34.500 --> 18:35.547
Brother.

18:40.167 --> 18:42.340
It's me, Baosen.

18:43.083 --> 18:46.508
Isn't the Northeast big enough for you?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.511
You had to come to Foshan? Get up.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.007
I'm taking you home.

18:55.042 --> 18:56.377
Home?

18:57.042 --> 18:58.294
How's that possible?

18:59.167 --> 19:02.671
The Japanese control the Northeast.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.923
The Japanese flag

19:07.500 --> 19:09.127
Won't wave OVBF me.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.005
The time's not ripe.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.676
Making soup like this

19:21.167 --> 19:22.840
is a lot of work.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.172
It's not soup.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.251
It's snake stew.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.048
Isn't that a winter dish?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.506
It's a dish from a long time ago.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.047
Yes, decades.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.339
was a Snake Year.

19:46.667 --> 19:50.342
You left the Northeast that year.

19:52.833 --> 19:56.758
The fire has to be right for stew.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.635
Too low -

20:00.458 --> 20:02.085
it'll lack taste.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.085
Too high -

20:05.042 --> 20:06.885
it'll scald.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.335
There's a lesson in that.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.634
Go.

20:18.833 --> 20:23.760
Wait till the fire can take this wood.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.384
<i>I'll go then.</i>

20:28.083 --> 20:29.630
The South may secede.

20:30.292 --> 20:31.714
It's no time for diplomacy.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.297
We're getting old.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.302
Don't risk your reputation.

20:40.542 --> 20:44.251
Ip is more than he appears to be.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.297
Force it,

20:47.917 --> 20:49.794
things could go wrong.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.173
I know what I'm doing.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.460
I'm creating opportunity.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.006
This fire today

21:04.750 --> 21:06.343
needs new wood.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.715
Your northern colleagues

21:13.208 --> 21:14.755
disapprove of this match.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.218
It's a huge honor.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.609
This Ip doesn't deserve it.

21:20.644 --> 21:22.218
It's not how things are done.

21:22.253 --> 21:24.051
Don't follow the herd.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.343
If the old never let go

21:28.292 --> 21:30.715
when will the young get their chance?

21:32.583 --> 21:34.256
Ip Man has talent.

21:35.167 --> 21:37.420
Let's see if he can prove himself.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.252
The Gong Family has never lost before.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.255
With you here,

21:43.375 --> 21:44.752
what right does he have?

21:49.292 --> 21:53.217
I once had a temper like yours:

21:53.750 --> 21:56.003
winning was everything.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.676
But life's bigger than that.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.051
Take a longer view.

22:02.708 --> 22:03.960
Past the mountains

22:05.000 --> 22:07.173
the world opens up.

22:08.833 --> 22:12.508
Not to see the good in others,

22:12.833 --> 22:14.426
not to admit their talent,

22:15.292 --> 22:17.215
is to lack generosity.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.802
Our high standards in martial arts

22:21.125 --> 22:23.173
apply to character as well.

23:00.667 --> 23:01.714
Father,

23:04.042 --> 23:08.422
why did you bring me to a brothel?

23:08.708 --> 23:10.676
If you don't see something,

23:13.042 --> 23:14.840
does it not exist?

23:16.208 --> 23:17.881
No harm in seeing.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.176
The first time I came here

23:22.792 --> 23:24.669
was before you were born.

23:27.250 --> 23:30.254
Twenty years have passed in a flash.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.007
In life,

23:32.042 --> 23:33.885
ability isn't everything.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.335
Some thrive in light,

23:37.833 --> 23:39.506
others in shadow.

23:41.167 --> 23:43.465
The times make us what we are.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.135
I asked you to come South

23:46.458 --> 23:48.256
to bring things full circle

23:49.333 --> 23:51.651
and to let you see

23:51.686 --> 23:53.969
how I step down.

23:54.625 --> 23:56.002
Since you were little,

23:56.625 --> 23:59.174
you've watched me fight.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.173
This is the last time.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.961
You're engaged to be married.

24:05.996 --> 24:07.676
The Martial World

24:08.500 --> 24:10.218
is no longer your world.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.459
Be a good doctor.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.582
Live a peaceful life.

24:14.617 --> 24:16.670
This is my greatest wish.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.002
Master Ip.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.793
We're here to celebrate.

24:32.828 --> 24:35.461
Your big day is coming up.

24:36.167 --> 24:40.343
We'd like to show you our support.

24:40.378 --> 24:41.960
I'm humbled, Uncle Deng.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.171
It's nothing at all.

24:44.206 --> 24:45.843
Don't mention it.

24:46.208 --> 24:47.460
Please.

24:57.708 --> 25:00.317
On behalf of the ladies

25:00.352 --> 25:02.882
and staff, congratulations.

25:02.917 --> 25:04.635
That's quite a battle formation.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.503
Sister San heads our Peking Opera troupe.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.173
She dabbles in Bagua.

25:20.208 --> 25:23.007
She'd like to offer a few pointers.

25:26.042 --> 25:27.259
Please.

25:28.833 --> 25:29.673
After you.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.676
Bagua is based on swordplay.

25:31.792 --> 25:33.465
Single reverse palm is a single blade.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.048
Double reverse palm is a double blade.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.919
The feet are out and in.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.340
There are 64 transformations.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.136
Attack comes out of nowhere.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.673
Sister San, it's just practice.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.718
No need to smash the ancestral tablets.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.843
I've done that many times before.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.255
No big deal.

26:21.333 --> 26:24.177
Mr Ip, Bagua is underhanded.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.925
Beware.

26:28.792 --> 26:29.839
Thank you.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.757
Ah, Mr Ip.

26:41.792 --> 26:43.382
Today is a happy day.

26:43.417 --> 26:47.547
We in Accounts wish you well.

26:53.333 --> 26:56.792
Xingyi began with General Yue Fei.

26:59.333 --> 27:02.052
It uses the fist as a spear.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.463
Drill

27:03.498 --> 27:04.791
Chop

27:04.826 --> 27:06.085
Cross

27:07.208 --> 27:08.300
Blast

27:09.833 --> 27:11.085
Crush

27:49.000 --> 27:52.334
Such sensitivity - impressive!

27:52.417 --> 27:55.170
That Crushing Fist is quite something.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.380
Mr IP,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.880
each challenge leads to a higher peak.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.843
Xingyi is brutal.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.590
Don't underestimate it.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.002
Let's see how high the peaks get.

28:10.037 --> 28:13.004
Hmm. This will be fun.

28:22.625 --> 28:26.129
My turn now, Master Ip.

28:26.833 --> 28:29.757
And what have you got for me, Yong?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.385
A string of firecrackers.

28:57.208 --> 29:00.417
That move, isn't that Hung Gar?

29:01.542 --> 29:02.794
I'm a jack of all trades.

29:14.167 --> 29:15.465
You do mix it up.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.717
What's wrong with that?

29:16.875 --> 29:18.502
<i>So long as it works.</i>

29:19.458 --> 29:22.732
The 64 Hands have endless combinations.

29:22.767 --> 29:26.007
Your Wing Chun is a three-trick pony.

29:26.042 --> 29:27.968
Spade, Pin, Sheath.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.840
How can it compete?

29:29.875 --> 29:31.752
Three's enough to take care of you.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.713
Yong, your fireworks have fizzled.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.128
What of it? I'm an old man.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.877
Youth trumps skill.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.294
He might be a grandmaster,

30:32.500 --> 30:34.173
but don't hold back.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.252
You'd better win.

30:37.542 --> 30:38.919
This has been a real privilege.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.629
To victory!

30:40.664 --> 30:42.009
Good luck.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.881
Every generation produces new talent.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.883
Mr Ip, we were fated to meet.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.840
For my final contest

31:23.208 --> 31:25.631
I suggest we match wits,

31:25.666 --> 31:27.093
not skill.

31:27.333 --> 31:28.334
Do you accept?

31:29.917 --> 31:31.461
As our guest,

31:31.496 --> 31:33.005
it's up to you.

31:41.417 --> 31:46.674
When our Union was founded 25 years ago,

31:49.333 --> 31:51.335
a man came from the South.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.297
He offered a challenge.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.298
He held out a flat cake

31:56.333 --> 31:59.132
and asked our Master to break.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.503
Our Master wasn't offended.

32:06.833 --> 32:10.167
He even named the man our first chairman.

32:10.708 --> 32:12.710
It wasn't because of his kungfu

32:13.000 --> 32:14.422
but what he said -

32:15.958 --> 32:17.801
Kungfu divides into North and South.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.252
<i>Must the country divide as well?</i>

32:22.833 --> 32:26.007
That man was also from Foshan -

32:26.042 --> 32:27.673
Ip Yun-biu.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.419
He was a great man.

32:30.708 --> 32:32.507
Today.

32:32.542 --> 32:35.421
Meeting another Mr Ip,

32:36.625 --> 32:39.879
I will ask that same question.

32:40.792 --> 32:41.839
Mr IP,

32:43.333 --> 32:48.214
can you break this cake in my hand?

33:36.583 --> 33:40.133
A Tai Chi master kept a bird from flying

33:40.542 --> 33:42.630
by giving it no perch

33:42.665 --> 33:44.718
from which to fly.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.173
The Old Master's skill is too great.

33:48.833 --> 33:52.419
Mr Ip is a sparrow in his palm.

33:52.454 --> 33:56.006
I don't think he can do it.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.340
The world is a big place.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.005
Why limit it to North and South?

34:53.333 --> 34:55.552
It holds you back.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.173
To you,

34:58.583 --> 35:00.381
this cake is the country.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.085
To me it's much more.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.926
Break from what you know

35:06.333 --> 35:08.085
and you will know more.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.422
If the Southern arts go far,

35:10.875 --> 35:13.754
what boundary is the North?

35:14.833 --> 35:16.210
Would you agree?

35:16.245 --> 35:17.676
Well said.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.968
All my life, I've been the victor.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.752
My technique has never failed me.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.923
I never thought I'd see

35:27.333 --> 35:29.802
the limits of my own vision.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.380
Mr IP,

35:41.458 --> 35:44.086
today I've made you famous.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.002
In future,

35:47.625 --> 35:49.969
you'll face challenges at every step.

35:51.125 --> 35:52.752
I hope you'll be like me.

35:53.583 --> 35:56.006
Pass on the torch.

35:57.167 --> 36:00.546
Never give up the faith.

36:01.125 --> 36:04.504
Keep the light burning.

36:58.042 --> 36:59.942
Miss Gong, you mustn't do this.

36:59.977 --> 37:01.843
The Gongs have never been defeated.

37:01.878 --> 37:05.463
I will redeem our honor.

37:07.333 --> 37:10.052
Give this to Ip. He'll understand.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.340
I have no chance

37:14.375 --> 37:16.798
to be as great as Father.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.968
It wasn't my choice.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.627
But I'll make my mark.

37:22.958 --> 37:24.210
Go.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.677
Tonight, following Northern custom,

37:34.292 --> 37:36.733
the winner will host a banquet.

37:36.768 --> 37:39.174
Neither Ip Man nor I will attend.

37:39.375 --> 37:41.002
You'll represent me.

37:41.037 --> 37:42.172
Don't worry.

37:42.667 --> 37:45.591
<i>I'll do the right thing.</i>

37:46.583 --> 37:47.835
Let's go!

38:07.625 --> 38:10.253
Of Master Gong's martial arts,

38:10.288 --> 38:13.311
Ma San inherited the steel

38:13.346 --> 38:16.334
and his daughter the silk.

38:16.417 --> 38:19.296
She is the sole heir to the 64 Hands.

38:19.417 --> 38:23.502
Her moves are deadly.

38:23.792 --> 38:28.002
In booking the whole place first,

38:28.208 --> 38:30.961
she forces your hand.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.593
Don't underrate Gong Er.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.426
The Martial World has four taboos:

38:37.125 --> 38:39.548
monks, Taoist priests, women and children.

38:40.333 --> 38:41.835
Grappling with them is a bad idea.

38:42.250 --> 38:46.255
She's gone to so much trouble -

38:46.290 --> 38:47.752
how could I not accept?

40:26.875 --> 40:28.502
Three days ago,

40:28.833 --> 40:30.756
my father sat here.

40:32.375 --> 40:33.672
Tonight,

40:34.625 --> 40:36.548
it's between us.

40:38.708 --> 40:39.425
Please.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.511
Pity about the lovely decor.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.085
Kungfu is about precision.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.502
If anything gets broken,

40:47.833 --> 40:48.925
you win.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.172
Mr IP,

44:08.958 --> 44:10.756
I showed you the 64 Hands

44:11.333 --> 44:12.798
so that you'd know

44:12.833 --> 44:15.882
the world is a big place.

44:16.167 --> 44:18.169
Kungfu isn't just charging forward.

44:18.204 --> 44:19.589
Look behind you as well.

44:19.917 --> 44:22.011
I hope that's enough of a clue.

44:22.333 --> 44:23.801
It went your way this time.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.718
Who knows what

44:25.833 --> 44:27.301
next time will bring.

44:28.083 --> 44:29.175
Come.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.217
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

44:32.792 --> 44:34.089
Take care.

45:41.333 --> 45:45.668
(I dream of seeing the 64 Hands)
(again in the snow.)

46:28.750 --> 46:32.755
(I'm waiting. What's keeping you?)

47:00.375 --> 47:01.718
Does it fit?

47:03.083 --> 47:04.710
Does Foshan get this cold?

47:10.833 --> 47:12.257
You look lovely.

47:12.292 --> 47:14.386
Let's take a family photo.

48:29.333 --> 48:35.170
(October 1938. Foshan fell to the Japanese.)

48:41.125 --> 48:42.672
In October 1938,

48:42.833 --> 48:44.005
the Japanese invaded Foshan.

48:44.333 --> 48:47.132
Their army took over our home.

48:47.833 --> 48:49.840
<i>If life has four seasons,</i>

48:49.875 --> 48:53.675
we went from spring straight to winter.

49:34.083 --> 49:36.882
<i>I'll be back with dinner.</i>

49:50.500 --> 49:51.968
Help me prosper?

49:52.958 --> 49:54.676
Rescue me from poverty?

49:56.875 --> 49:58.673
I've never been poor in my life.

49:59.542 --> 50:00.919
The country's in crisis

50:01.667 --> 50:02.759
and everyone is suffering.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.593
To be poor is no big deal.

50:07.708 --> 50:09.335
I'd rather starve

50:10.333 --> 50:11.710
than eat Japanese rice.

50:12.792 --> 50:14.260
I won't collaborate.

50:15.500 --> 50:18.253
I have plenty of friends.

50:18.708 --> 50:22.008
They'll help me through.

50:22.417 --> 50:23.839
Enjoy your dinner.

50:30.542 --> 50:32.670
You won't find those friends here,

50:33.250 --> 50:34.715
only collaborators.

50:34.750 --> 50:36.334
We had a dinner just now.

50:36.369 --> 50:37.791
These are the leftovers.

50:37.826 --> 50:39.173
If it's not beneath you,

50:39.208 --> 50:41.131
take them back to your family.

50:44.833 --> 50:46.130
How can I accept?

50:46.708 --> 50:48.298
Dirty money paid for it.

50:48.333 --> 50:51.052
No point in waste. We're old friends.

50:51.167 --> 50:52.714
You're most welcome.

51:48.208 --> 51:49.710
They're brand new.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.718
I was going to the Northeast.

51:52.125 --> 51:53.502
But that's impossible now.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.844
Sell them and I can feed my family.

51:58.833 --> 52:00.255
Why is there a button missing?

52:03.000 --> 52:04.468
Is there?

52:05.375 --> 52:06.672
Must've dropped off.

52:13.208 --> 52:14.835
I began studying kungfu at seven.

52:14.870 --> 52:16.229
Before I turned forty,

52:16.264 --> 52:17.589
I was never beaten.

52:17.875 --> 52:19.172
When that happened,

52:19.833 --> 52:22.211
It was life that dealt the blows.

52:22.833 --> 52:24.294
In eight years of war

52:24.329 --> 52:25.755
I lost everything.

52:26.167 --> 52:27.421
Money.

52:27.456 --> 52:28.676
Friends...

52:29.042 --> 52:32.125
China will never die!

52:36.875 --> 52:38.752
Girls obey their Madam.

52:39.542 --> 52:41.260
Gangsters obey their boss.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.709
Our boss was Sun Yat-sen

52:43.744 --> 52:45.460
We followed his orders.

52:47.708 --> 52:50.211
We Southerners have fire in our bellies

52:50.583 --> 52:51.709
and a sense of honour.

52:53.333 --> 52:56.837
Only cowards fear the Japs.

52:57.167 --> 52:58.589
<i>I'll kill any I see!</i>

52:58.875 --> 53:02.630
(1938. Uncle Deng died)
(in a Japanese bombardment.)

53:02.625 --> 53:05.708
(Collaborators took over the Gold Pavilion.)

53:06.333 --> 53:07.835
Finally, I lost my family.

53:41.833 --> 53:49.627
(Ip Man lost two daughters in the war.)

54:23.625 --> 54:26.344
No one move!

54:27.375 --> 54:29.298
Where are you going? Show your IDs!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.217
Hurry.

54:31.833 --> 54:33.005
IDS!

54:35.375 --> 54:38.094
Where are you going? IDs!

54:39.333 --> 54:42.758
Halt!

55:49.833 --> 55:54.509
(1939. Traveling to Northwest University)
(to practice medicine,)

55:54.500 --> 55:56.844
(Gong Er meets The Razor, a Nationalist agent.)

56:24.167 --> 56:26.670
(1940. Ma San collaborates with the Japanese,)

56:26.667 --> 56:29.011
(taking an official post in the puppet government.)

56:58.750 --> 57:01.344
Do you remember what I taught you?

57:01.333 --> 57:02.380
Yes.

57:03.042 --> 57:05.966
Never put yourself first,

57:06.167 --> 57:08.010
show respect.

57:09.750 --> 57:12.833
There's always someone better.

57:12.833 --> 57:14.710
To yield is not to lose.

57:15.333 --> 57:18.132
Master, you have taught me

57:18.667 --> 57:22.092
to be modest

57:22.083 --> 57:23.585
and know my place.

57:23.583 --> 57:25.506
I took you in as an orphan.

57:27.333 --> 57:29.586
You brought

57:29.583 --> 57:32.336
credit to our school.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.923
Let's go over

57:35.625 --> 57:37.673
my supreme move.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.505
The Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.

57:45.375 --> 57:46.592
Have you practiced it?

57:47.500 --> 57:48.843
Yes.

57:48.833 --> 57:52.133
You know the key to it?

57:52.125 --> 57:54.674
I was never told.

57:54.667 --> 57:56.510
It's looking back in reflection.

57:57.167 --> 57:58.669
It's not the upward move,

57:59.625 --> 58:00.751
but the turning back.

58:05.542 --> 58:07.544
Understand what I'm saying?

58:08.875 --> 58:11.594
A warrior molds himself to the times.

58:14.417 --> 58:15.839
What if

58:16.500 --> 58:18.173
I can't turn back?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.173
Then the Gong Family legacy

58:24.708 --> 58:27.257
cannot live on in you.

58:45.500 --> 58:46.626
Stay back.

58:49.333 --> 58:50.710
Let him go.

58:52.167 --> 58:54.670
Never darken my door again.

59:00.917 --> 59:02.260
Get lost.

59:09.333 --> 59:11.085
<i>Master'.!</i>

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:22.759
The whole clan

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.627
heard you were coming

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.335
and raced in from all over.

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.300
And Jiang?

01:00:27.292 --> 01:00:29.044
He's keeping them company.

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.376
Miss Gong,

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:41.336
they're awaiting your decision.

01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:43.340
They didn't come all this way

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.801
to hear my decision.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:51.001
Did Father have any last words?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.422
Don't seek vengeance.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:58.043
Miss,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.343
your father forbade revenge.

01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:36.590
I agree Ma San deserves to die.

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:40.965
It's a massive crime

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.672
to betray one's teacher.

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:47.506
Nothing is worse.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:50.175
On the other hand,

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.794
it was your father

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:56.261
who united Xingyi and Bagua.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.834
Ma San worked hard at Xingyi.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:02.502
And your father taught you

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.674
the 64 Hands himself.

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:09.337
The two of you are his legacy.

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:11.547
If you stand together,

01:02:12.458 --> 01:02:15.337
the legacy remains whole.

01:02:16.917 --> 01:02:18.089
Besides,

01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:21.007
if you take action,

01:02:21.417 --> 01:02:24.216
whatever the outcome,

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:27.335
people will laugh.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.549
They'll say what's this Gong school

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:32.343
where the disciple kills the master,

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.545
and the daughter kills her brother-in-arms?

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:40.335
A pack of wild animals?

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:43.336
Besides, as for Ma San,

01:02:43.667 --> 01:02:46.716
even your father couldn't finish him off.

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:48.377
You think you can?

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.044
Miss Gong,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.423
we're old men.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.425
We made the long trip here

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:04.005
with your best interests in mind.

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:06.836
Take our advice.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:09.677
Just get married.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.673
Your father's last words

01:03:13.917 --> 01:03:16.511
were Don't seek vengeance.

01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:19.677
If you kill Ma San

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:22.382
won't that go against his wishes?

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:26.635
My father said that

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.672
out of love for me.

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:32.465
He wants me to have a peaceful life.

01:03:34.167 --> 01:03:36.010
But if I don't avenge his death,

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.380
<i>I'll never be at peace.</i>

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.673
I understand what you're saying.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.676
With respect,

01:03:51.792 --> 01:03:55.092
he treated you

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:57.127
all like brothers.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:59.339
After he died,

01:04:00.542 --> 01:04:03.170
you should've dealt with Ma San.

01:04:03.417 --> 01:04:04.964
Instead you come here

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:07.211
<i>as his messenger.</i>

01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:12.170
After all my father did for you!

01:04:14.167 --> 01:04:15.589
I know

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:18.460
Ma San works for the Japanese.

01:04:19.417 --> 01:04:20.543
He's got power.

01:04:22.083 --> 01:04:23.835
But I'll stand up for my family.

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:26.840
Is he coming, or not?

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:34.420
What does it matter?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.253
He comes, you go,

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.881
and that's the end of it, right?

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:47.464
It's better to let it go, Miss Gong.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:50.382
Some things are out of our hands.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:53.340
It's the Will of Heaven.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.052
Maybe I am the Will of Heaven.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:26.292
Oh ye gods and spirits

01:05:27.833 --> 01:05:31.508
guide this soul to Paradise!

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.877
Halt!

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:42.176
We mustn't stop!

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:45.045
Don't block the road.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:47.506
Keep to the side.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.376
Move!

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.923
Ma San ordered us

01:06:50.917 --> 01:06:52.419
to escort the body.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:56.255
Miss Gong,

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:57.342
Ma San's men

01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:58.835
are blocking the road.

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.335
The have banners of mourning.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:02.176
Troublemakers!

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.134
Miss Gong,

01:07:03.125 --> 01:07:06.095
time is of the essence.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.093
Jiang!

01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:33.337
Tell Ma San he's a dead man.

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:37.381
Let's go!

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:43.508
Oh ye gods and spirits

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:47.758
...guide this soul to Paradise!

01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.585
They're here.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:07:59.835
Stop her.

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:01.418
Keep her back.

01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:02.464
Let me at her.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:03.964
Stop her.

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:08.632
Stay back. We're here for Ma San.

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:18.756
Since you're my senior,

01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:20.589
I won't force my way in.

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:22.718
But know this.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.344
You can't hide from me forever.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:28.631
I will take back my family's legacy.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.001
Come out!

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:36.966
Better to advance than to stop.

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:40.299
The Old Master taught me this.

01:08:40.292 --> 01:08:42.670
It became my philosophy of life.

01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:43.919
It's a shame

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.715
he couldn't follow his own advice.

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:49.712
His precious teachings are mine now.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.046
You want them -

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:54.551
send a member of the family.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.131
You'll be marrying out.

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:02.759
You don't count.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.423
Don't ask after me.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:30.840
No news means I'm gone.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:39.260
Find someone else.

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.216
Miss,

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:50.381
to give up such an ideal marriage -

01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:52.169
is it really worth it?

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:56.885
Think it over.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.672
If you take those vows,

01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:01.506
you'll never be able to marry,

01:10:02.792 --> 01:10:05.762
teach, or have children.

01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:09.211
There's no turning back.

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:18.210
Father,

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:22.090
can you read what's in my heart?

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:26.002
If you agree with me,

01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:30.465
show me a flame before Buddha.

01:11:09.583 --> 01:11:12.837
Better to advance than to stop.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:16.343
He mocks us for having no successor.

01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:32.669
I can only advance.

01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:35.339
I can't stop.

01:12:25.042 --> 01:12:29.593
(1950. Hong Kong. Tai Nan Street)

01:12:34.667 --> 01:12:36.089
Ever taught before, Master Ip?

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:37.835
To teach for a living

01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:38.959
is a new experience.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:40.801
So why now?

01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:42.509
I'm starting a new life.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.218
You've got your things.

01:12:44.208 --> 01:12:45.630
You're confident.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:47.175
Saves running back and forth.

01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:49.169
In Hong Kong no one knows Wing Chun.

01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:51.005
Any special moves?

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:52.342
Not really.

01:12:52.833 --> 01:12:55.507
Three basic hands - Spade, Pin, Sheath.

01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:57.714
How many forms?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.047
The Concept,

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.342
The Bridge,

01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:02.584
and Darting Fingers.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.626
Weapons?

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:06.505
Double Knives

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.843
and the Six-and-a-half Point Pole.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:09.760
Anything else?

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.502
That's it.

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.044
Bone-setting,

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:15.134
internal energy -

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:16.342
I don't do any of that.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.509
Drifters,

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.547
lion dancers -

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.593
I don't teach those types.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.342
Why not?

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:27.215
Kungfu isn't a sideshow.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:29.218
So I won't teach drifters.

01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:31.589
Lion dancers jump at firecrackers.

01:13:31.958 --> 01:13:33.835
They're always brawling

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.002
and showing off,

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:37.760
all for a bit of cash.

01:13:38.917 --> 01:13:40.169
It's crude.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:42.010
<i>I'll ask you straight -</i>

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:43.880
ever been in a real fight?

01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:47.798
It's wall-to-wall kungfu schools here.

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:49.294
They start fights over nothing.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.675
Master Ip,

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.172
have you got what it takes?

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.171
Try me and find out.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:58.584
Fight! Fight!

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:01.843
I've had a few years of training.

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:05.426
Show me your stuff, Master Ip.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:06.714
Have you had lunch?

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.335
Barbecued pork and rice.

01:14:08.333 --> 01:14:09.505
I suggest you wait a bit.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.547
It'd be a shame to waste it.

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:11.634
Waste it?

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:26.668
Brother Hung,

01:14:26.833 --> 01:14:28.301
are you okay?

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:31.842
Where's the tea?

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:33.085
Tea?

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:34.334
To give to your new master!

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:36.920
We've put a bed here for you.

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:40.210
I hope it'll do for now.

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:41.839
Sorry it's a bit shabby.

01:14:57.333 --> 01:14:58.505
Is there a hammer?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.172
Master Ip,

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:20.962
The boys and I want some lessons.

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:21.880
Eighty cents a head.

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:23.172
Cheap enough.

01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:24.419
But call yourself a master,

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:25.509
you'd better deliver the goods.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.218
No snake oil.

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.176
How good's your kungfu, anyway?

01:15:44.792 --> 01:15:45.759
Lock the gate.

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:49.418
Hey!

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:50.509
Little fucker.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.298
Shut the door and it's on for real.

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:53.968
You've got two hands and two feet.

01:15:53.958 --> 01:15:55.255
How you gonna beat us all?

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.843
You're mistaken.

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:58.959
I have two hands but

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:01.092
Wing Chun has eight kicks.

01:16:01.667 --> 01:16:03.010
Never mind your boys.

01:16:03.667 --> 01:16:06.261
There's more than enough for you.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.718
More than enough for me?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.343
That one's free.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:38.842
First kick.

01:16:59.417 --> 01:17:00.589
Fourth kick.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:14.960
One more left.

01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:38.007
Do you remember our oath?

01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:40.919
What oath?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.502
I vow with all my heart

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.843
to be loyal

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:46.255
and obedient

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:47.752
to the Party.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.172
I fear neither hardship

01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:50.464
nor sacrifice.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.801
Should I forsake these vows,

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:58.503
I accept the harshest punishment.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.797
Fuck.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.548
The war is over.

01:18:03.542 --> 01:18:05.089
This is Hong Kong.

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.927
But we stand by our code -

01:18:08.625 --> 01:18:09.968
Join us alive.

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:11.710
Leave us dead.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:13.718
I'm leaving now.

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:15.714
Can you stop me?

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:18.135
Try us and see.

01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:04.467
(In exile in Hong Kong, The Razor)

01:20:04.458 --> 01:20:09.168
(ran the White Rose Barber Shop.)

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.005
(1950. Chinese New Year's Eve. Hong Kong)

01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:14.091
You don't look like you need a doctor.

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:18.001
I'd like to see the 64 Hands again.

01:21:18.333 --> 01:21:20.051
If you don't mind me saying -

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:21.760
You lost. I won.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.002
Have a seat.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:33.877
If you'd said that at the door,

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.334
I wouldn't have made it so easy

01:21:38.833 --> 01:21:41.131
for you to get your dumplings.

01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:44.759
Thank you.

01:21:52.917 --> 01:21:54.169
You know,

01:21:55.167 --> 01:21:58.626
I'd hoped to visit the Northeast in 1937.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.127
There was a challenge waiting for me.

01:22:04.792 --> 01:22:06.009
I had a warm coat made.

01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:10.126
But the war stopped me from going.

01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:13.380
I didn't keep the coat,

01:22:15.083 --> 01:22:16.551
but I still have one of its buttons.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:19.842
Call it a memento.

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:25.844
The 64 Hands is too important a legacy.

01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:30.465
Why let it disappear?

01:22:33.917 --> 01:22:35.214
In centuries of martial arts history,

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.377
so many things

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.343
have vanished.

01:22:40.542 --> 01:22:42.340
Why should the Gong Family arts survive?

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:48.426
Mr IP,

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:50.881
no art is higher than Heaven

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.672
no gift more solid than Earth.

01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:57.667
Nothing lasts forever and that's fine.

01:22:58.792 --> 01:23:00.510
Keep this button.

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:04.541
As for what may and may not be seen,

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.672
let's not talk about it now.

01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:15.922
Mr Ip, ten years ago on New Year's eve

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:17.214
do you know where I was?

01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:23.380
Mr IP,

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.002
may I have a word?

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:32.213
The Gong arts belong to the Gong family.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.836
The 64 Hands aren't there just for show.

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.843
The Gong Family lives.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.968
I know how much talent is there.

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:43.298
I'm keen to learn.

01:23:43.542 --> 01:23:44.964
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:12.007
People - they change with the times.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.344
Wear shoes that suit the crossing,

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:18.086
and underpants that fit your ass.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.968
In Hong Kong,

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.256
I can only afford these cigarettes.

01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:26.335
Back home,

01:24:26.542 --> 01:24:28.761
I smoked real Manchurian tobacco.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:30.676
Now that was smoking.

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:36.666
Be mild, good, respectful, thrifty, deferential.

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:38.585
Deferential is the key.

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.343
Let's say I'm smoking.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:45.344
A stranger sits down.

01:24:45.667 --> 01:24:48.216
I defer to him: Have a smoke.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:52.338
Even if he doesn't smoke, he must accept

01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:54.506
or he'll make me lose face.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.877
Mr IP,

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:01.131
have a smoke.

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:07.334
Thank you.

01:25:07.333 --> 01:25:08.835
You're welcome.

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.877
You've got the gift.

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:55.836
Twenty years ago,

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.710
we could have sparred.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.377
What a shame.

01:26:05.917 --> 01:26:08.887
Some work in the light,

01:26:09.125 --> 01:26:10.798
others in shadow.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.335
The face of a school must be spotless.

01:26:14.333 --> 01:26:16.586
Blood must flow only in the shadows.

01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:19.795
If not, if it stains the face,

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:22.465
then the school itself may perish.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.219
The face offers the cigarettes.

01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:28.632
The dirty work is done in the shadows.

01:26:29.875 --> 01:26:33.175
Mr lp, you're too late.

01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:35.044
Forget the 64 hands -

01:26:35.833 --> 01:26:38.177
you'll never see even one.

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:44.880
(1940. Chinese New Year's Eve. The Northeast.)

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:04.006
Is it hard to kill a man?

01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:06.593
Miss Gong,

01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:09.298
it's not like in the old days.

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:12.260
Murder is punishable by death.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:16.758
Is Ma San worth it?

01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:23.756
We make our own path in life.

01:27:24.917 --> 01:27:26.260
Should we go home,

01:27:27.167 --> 01:27:28.589
or keep waiting?

01:27:33.042 --> 01:27:34.669
It's New Year's Eve.

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.510
He'll be here soon.

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:39.714
We have to wait.

01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:42.259
All right.

01:27:48.167 --> 01:27:49.510
We'll wait.

01:31:27.625 --> 01:31:31.084
This is between Miss Gong and Ma San.

01:31:31.292 --> 01:31:33.761
Everyone else stay out of it.

01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:36.426
There you are,

01:31:37.667 --> 01:31:39.840
still playing with your monkey.

01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:42.338
Deal with him!

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:43.585
Get him!

01:32:24.417 --> 01:32:25.964
You're worse than a debt collector,

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.761
trying to ruin my New Year's Eve.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.460
The dumplings are in the pot,

01:32:33.167 --> 01:32:35.169
but you won't be eating them.

01:32:36.750 --> 01:32:38.468
I let you off before

01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:42.834
to avoid destroying the Gong clan.

01:32:44.083 --> 01:32:46.051
You should know when to give up.

01:32:46.833 --> 01:32:48.881
Those needing salvation burn joss.

01:32:49.667 --> 01:32:51.465
Those who are hungry, eat.

01:32:52.583 --> 01:32:53.835
What I must do,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.298
I will do and nothing can stop me.

01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:58.840
The Gong Family legacy

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:02.090
must return to me tonight.

01:33:02.833 --> 01:33:03.834
Fine.

01:33:05.417 --> 01:33:08.717
It's a part of me.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:11.635
You want it -

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.172
come and get it.

01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:14.672
<i>Master'.!</i>

01:37:14.667 --> 01:37:16.715
<i>Keep away-</i>

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.176
Ma San,

01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:22.214
Speak!

01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:37.339
That day,

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.797
the Old Master

01:37:41.167 --> 01:37:42.794
spoke to me

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:45.843
about his supreme move -

01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:48.627
Old Monkey Hangs up his Badge.

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:52.926
He said the key to the move

01:37:54.458 --> 01:37:56.005
was turning back.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.752
At the time,

01:38:07.625 --> 01:38:09.093
I didn't get it.

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:14.505
I thought

01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:16.885
he couldn't keep up with the times.

01:38:27.875 --> 01:38:29.718
The Gong Family legacy

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.343
I return to you.

01:38:34.833 --> 01:38:36.506
Let's be clear.

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.335
You didn't return it.

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:43.177
I took it back myself.

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.672
Miss Gong!

01:40:08.792 --> 01:40:10.339
Miss Gong!

01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:35.510
(1952. Hong Kong. White Rose Barber Shop)

01:40:46.042 --> 01:40:47.385
Sorry.

01:40:48.708 --> 01:40:50.085
I miss my mom.

01:40:53.625 --> 01:40:56.378
You got my notice about the memorial?

01:40:56.958 --> 01:40:58.426
Yes.

01:41:01.208 --> 01:41:03.051
Open a business, follow the rules.

01:41:04.417 --> 01:41:05.634
It's the same everywhere.

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:09.131
Do you know how much weight

01:41:10.208 --> 01:41:11.835
a summons from me carries?

01:41:15.167 --> 01:41:16.384
It's measured in gold.

01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:21.754
Brother, I've got the money.

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:24.047
And I've got my life.

01:41:25.833 --> 01:41:27.426
Whichever is worth more,

01:41:28.292 --> 01:41:29.293
take it.

01:41:35.958 --> 01:41:37.505
I like those eyes of yours.

01:41:39.792 --> 01:41:41.169
They remind me of my mom's.

01:41:41.417 --> 01:41:43.215
Want both? Or just one?

01:41:43.917 --> 01:41:45.169
Not so fast.

01:41:47.708 --> 01:41:48.800
How about,

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:52.085
you do the honors?

01:41:54.042 --> 01:41:55.510
Forget it.

01:41:57.042 --> 01:41:58.544
You're a real man.

01:42:01.708 --> 01:42:03.130
It's the anniversary of my mom's death.

01:42:04.167 --> 01:42:06.295
<i>I'll leave you those two lamps of yours.</i>

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.923
As the rivers flow, we'll meet again.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:12.505
<i>I'll take my leave.</i>

01:42:14.833 --> 01:42:16.130
Want the money -

01:42:17.333 --> 01:42:19.335
there're rules for that too.

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.423
What use are rules?

01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:23.047
Keep it simple.

01:42:23.042 --> 01:42:25.170
I stab you three times then you stab me.

01:42:25.167 --> 01:42:26.419
How common.

01:42:26.417 --> 01:42:28.215
Then raise the tone.

01:42:32.792 --> 01:42:34.419
See that chair over there?

01:42:35.708 --> 01:42:37.585
If I can't plant your ass there,

01:42:38.458 --> 01:42:41.257
keep the cash.

01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:46.594
You're kidding, aren't you?

01:43:20.667 --> 01:43:21.919
Brother,

01:43:23.375 --> 01:43:25.969
here's your prayer money.

01:43:27.333 --> 01:43:28.835
Next time you'll be joining your mom.

01:43:29.375 --> 01:43:30.843
Off you go.

01:43:32.833 --> 01:43:34.176
To tell the truth,

01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:39.669
Take me as a disciple!

01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:41.380
Teach you?

01:43:42.167 --> 01:43:43.885
It'd be a waste of my time.

01:43:47.667 --> 01:43:49.635
That's speaking honestly too.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:03.047
Just a few pointers?

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:26.844
(That same year, The Razor began teaching.)

01:44:26.833 --> 01:44:30.588
(Baji kungfu came to Hong Kong.)

01:44:48.625 --> 01:44:52.584
In 1952, Gong Er stopped seeing patients.

01:44:53.375 --> 01:44:56.424
Some say her old injury drove her to opium.

01:44:56.833 --> 01:44:59.211
Others that she was obsessed with kungfu.

01:45:00.333 --> 01:45:03.337
I last saw her at a teahouse.

01:45:43.792 --> 01:45:45.169
Do you know this opera?

01:45:46.667 --> 01:45:48.590
I think I heard it before in Foshan.

01:45:50.167 --> 01:45:51.384
Something about a dream.

01:45:51.625 --> 01:45:53.002
A Dream of Love.

01:45:55.792 --> 01:45:57.590
Love is just that, a dream.

01:45:58.833 --> 01:46:00.335
It's said

01:46:00.917 --> 01:46:03.966
<i>no instrument is as lovely as a voice.</i>

01:46:05.167 --> 01:46:08.671
Words always sound better sung.

01:46:08.667 --> 01:46:10.214
Has Miss Gong studied opera?

01:46:10.208 --> 01:46:11.505
Just the basics.

01:46:18.708 --> 01:46:24.511
Back then if I'd put my mind to it,

01:46:25.833 --> 01:46:27.756
I'd be an opera star.

01:46:28.292 --> 01:46:31.922
All those tales, happy and sad...

01:46:33.375 --> 01:46:35.218
If I tired of Yang Family Women Generals,

01:46:36.167 --> 01:46:38.340
I'd sing Waking from a Dream.

01:46:39.875 --> 01:46:41.001
Think of it -

01:46:43.167 --> 01:46:46.501
me on stage, you in the audience,

01:46:48.833 --> 01:46:50.756
meeting that way.

01:46:52.417 --> 01:46:53.714
Wouldn't that be something?

01:46:54.667 --> 01:46:56.340
But what if it was sold out?

01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.010
You flatter me.

01:47:00.083 --> 01:47:02.882
If you came, I'd save you a seat.

01:47:04.417 --> 01:47:08.342
You've performed well in the opera of life.

01:47:08.333 --> 01:47:11.007
You have both timing and skill.

01:47:11.292 --> 01:47:13.010
Unfortunately,

01:47:14.167 --> 01:47:15.339
you never saw beyond your role.

01:47:18.708 --> 01:47:20.676
I'd no idea you watched me like an opera.

01:47:23.708 --> 01:47:25.085
This opera of mine,

01:47:25.917 --> 01:47:27.760
applauded or not,

01:47:28.333 --> 01:47:29.960
will play on to the end.

01:47:33.667 --> 01:47:35.294
I asked you

01:47:36.042 --> 01:47:37.885
here to bring things to a close

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.968
and say what needs to be said.

01:47:40.542 --> 01:47:41.714
Are you going somewhere?

01:47:47.333 --> 01:47:49.131
We have a saying in the North -

01:47:50.208 --> 01:47:53.178
a tiger never quits the mountain.

01:47:54.833 --> 01:47:58.918
We've both been living on foreign soil.

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:03.252
I'm so very tired.

01:48:04.458 --> 01:48:05.710
I want to go home.

01:48:09.042 --> 01:48:12.125
But I wanted to return this to you first.

01:48:29.792 --> 01:48:31.089
As for the 64 Hands,

01:48:34.333 --> 01:48:36.006
I've already forgotten them.

01:48:42.542 --> 01:48:47.878
I was lucky to meet you in my prime.

01:48:52.542 --> 01:48:54.089
Sadly, my time is running out.

01:48:56.458 --> 01:49:00.167
To say there are no regrets in life,

01:49:01.333 --> 01:49:03.335
is just to fool yourself.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.676
How boring it would be without regrets.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:20.834
Mr Ip, to tell you the truth,

01:49:24.167 --> 01:49:26.090
I cared about you.

01:49:35.167 --> 01:49:37.215
I don't mind telling you that.

01:49:38.792 --> 01:49:40.260
It's not a crime to love.

01:49:45.375 --> 01:49:47.469
But that's all it can ever be.

01:49:52.208 --> 01:49:54.085
I never said that to anyone before.

01:49:56.833 --> 01:49:58.335
Seeing you tonight,

01:49:59.417 --> 01:50:01.385
I don't know why, it just came out.

01:50:09.292 --> 01:50:11.169
Let's say we suspend this game

01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.844
of chess between us.

01:50:21.667 --> 01:50:23.044
Take care.

01:50:34.458 --> 01:50:37.007
In life, as in chess,

01:50:37.667 --> 01:50:39.544
a move once made stays on the board.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.217
What we have

01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:47.002
is simply fate.

01:50:54.208 --> 01:50:55.585
Your father once said,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.799
never give up the faith.

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.002
Keep the light burning.

01:51:05.292 --> 01:51:06.669
I hope that one day

01:51:06.917 --> 01:51:09.295
<i>I'll see the 64 Hands once more.</i>

01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:19.711
My father said mastery had three stages -

01:52:21.542 --> 01:52:22.839
being,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.092
knowing.

01:52:26.708 --> 01:52:28.426
Doing.

01:52:31.375 --> 01:52:33.002
I know myself.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.468
I've seen the world.

01:52:42.167 --> 01:52:43.794
Sadly, I can't pass on what I know.

01:52:50.667 --> 01:52:52.340
This is a road

01:52:53.375 --> 01:52:54.843
I won't see to the end.

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.548
I hope you will.

01:53:23.542 --> 01:53:25.294
Is this street of schools

01:53:26.625 --> 01:53:28.468
all the Martial World has come to be?

01:55:27.250 --> 01:55:31.335
A great age offers a choice:

01:55:31.917 --> 01:55:34.591
stay or move on.

01:55:35.833 --> 01:55:38.427
I choose to remain in my era,

01:55:39.333 --> 01:55:41.335
the times when I was happiest.

01:55:42.458 --> 01:55:45.917
(In 1953, Gong Er died in Hong Kong.)

01:55:45.917 --> 01:55:49.046
(She kept her vows)

01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:53.297
(to the end.)

01:56:06.917 --> 01:56:09.841
Tomorrow I take Miss Gong's coffin home.

01:56:11.208 --> 01:56:12.676
She left this for you.

01:56:15.167 --> 01:56:19.673
In imperial times I was an executioner.

01:56:21.667 --> 01:56:25.717
The Republic left me out of a job.

01:56:27.042 --> 01:56:29.465
Had Master Gong not taken me in,

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:32.677
I'd have landed in the gutter like a dog.

01:56:35.167 --> 01:56:37.716
He never looked down on me.

01:56:38.625 --> 01:56:41.299
He made me his daughter's guardian.

01:56:42.208 --> 01:56:45.007
My fierceness would protect her.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.459
He nicknamed me Lucky Star,

01:56:51.583 --> 01:56:57.386
so fortune would shine on her always.

01:57:05.833 --> 01:57:07.335
For a woman,

01:57:07.708 --> 01:57:10.006
taking vows is a kind of death.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.627
To avenge her father,

01:57:15.917 --> 01:57:19.922
she vowed never to marry or teach,

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:22.085
to remain single her whole life.

01:57:23.917 --> 01:57:25.510
She kept that vow.

01:57:32.333 --> 01:57:33.835
These are the ashes

01:57:34.125 --> 01:57:37.675
from when she cut and burnt her hair.

01:57:40.458 --> 01:57:44.668
She said she knew you a long time,

01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:47.172
But you didn't really know her,

01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:48.842
nor she you.

01:57:52.208 --> 01:57:53.881
Seeing these ashes,

01:57:57.083 --> 01:57:58.676
you'll understand her better.

01:58:04.333 --> 01:58:05.630
Mr IP,

01:58:06.833 --> 01:58:08.506
the Gong Family is through.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.959
Miss Gong belongs to you now.

01:59:17.917 --> 01:59:19.385
Like her father,

01:59:19.833 --> 01:59:22.427
Gong Er never lost a fight.

01:59:24.667 --> 01:59:27.967
She only ever lost to herself.

01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:57.335
(1953. Ip Man gets his Hong Kong ID)

01:59:57.333 --> 02:00:01.588
after the border to China is shut.

02:00:30.042 --> 02:00:31.589
The day I left Foshan,

02:00:32.250 --> 02:00:33.718
I wanted to say something

02:00:34.833 --> 02:00:36.301
but couldn't speak the words.

02:00:38.083 --> 02:00:44.466
(My heart will carry me back to you.)

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:18.173
When I left her that time,

02:01:18.417 --> 02:01:20.169
I thought I'd be able to return.

02:01:20.542 --> 02:01:23.045
But it was the last time I saw her.

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.594
After that I only had the path ahead.

02:01:26.583 --> 02:01:27.800
There was no turning back,

02:01:29.667 --> 02:01:31.010
and no road home.

02:01:34.167 --> 02:01:37.501
(In 1960, Zhang Yongcheng died of illness.)

02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:40.128
(Ip Man never returned to Foshan.)

02:02:44.167 --> 02:02:46.386
Okay, begin.

02:02:49.708 --> 02:02:50.630
Left fist

02:02:50.625 --> 02:02:51.626
out,

02:02:51.917 --> 02:02:53.009
Palm open,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.343
turn the wrist,

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:55.668
pull back,

02:02:55.667 --> 02:02:56.839
right fist.

02:02:56.833 --> 02:02:57.834
Out,

02:02:57.833 --> 02:02:58.834
open.

02:02:58.833 --> 02:02:59.959
Twist the wrist,

02:02:59.958 --> 02:03:01.335
pull back.

02:03:13.167 --> 02:03:14.384
Mr IP,

02:03:15.667 --> 02:03:17.169
all encounters in this world

02:03:18.292 --> 02:03:20.044
are a kind of reunion.

02:04:17.167 --> 02:04:20.501
They say I popularized Wing Chun.

02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:22.380
I hope they're right.

02:04:22.833 --> 02:04:24.460
I never did it for fame.

02:04:24.458 --> 02:04:26.426
The martial arts belong to all.

02:04:26.958 --> 02:04:28.505
We're all on the same quest.

02:04:29.292 --> 02:04:31.340
It all comes down to those two words -

02:04:31.708 --> 02:04:33.335
Horizontal. Vertical.

02:05:50.458 --> 02:05:55.168
(Ip Man was a huge inspiration to others.)
(Because of him,)

02:05:55.167 --> 02:06:01.425
(the torch of Wing Chun)
(has been carried around the world.)
