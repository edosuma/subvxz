00:03.360 --> 00:05.522
I figured out how to
close the gates of hell.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.080
Basically, God built a series of tests.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.607
When you've done all three,
you can slam the gates.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.001
- You need backup.
- No, I need you safe.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.049
We know where this ends. One of us dies.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.244
I'm gonna do these trials.
I'm gonna do them alone. End of story.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.761
- Spell's not gonna work.
- I didn't pass the test.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.928
But I did. And I'm doing the rest of them.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.683
Sam.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.124
I'm good. I'm okay.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.725
I can do this.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.209
Oh, God.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.290
Oh, no.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.764
Dang it.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.091
Dispatch, 7 Mary 4. You got your ears on?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.765
Go ahead, 7 Mary 4.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.083
I got a hit and run on 89. He's dead.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.924
What's the condition of the body?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.651
Looks like he's frozen solid.
Please advise.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.928
7 Mary 4, please hold your position.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.686
We'll send an ambulance to your location.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.170
What the hell?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.604
What's up with you?

04:03.080 --> 04:05.162
Nothing. Why?

04:10.160 --> 04:11.889
Heard from Kevin?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.600
Uh, no. Nothing yet.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.524
What's it been? Like three weeks?

04:18.680 --> 04:22.002
What's taking that little brainiac so long?
It's a book, read it.

04:22.160 --> 04:27.041
Translating an ancient language with zero
help might be more difficult than we think.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.681
So no word from Cass, Kevin's taking
his sweet time, and you're acting cagey.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.568
We need a lead
before I start climbing these walls.

04:34.720 --> 04:41.729
Well, uh, ahem,
in that case, I can give you zombies.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.526
Guy gets hit by a car,
left for dead overnight...

04:47.720 --> 04:51.327
...guts spilled out all over the road,
then gets up and walks away from it.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.006
- Nothing about brain munching?
- Remember Bobby's wife?

04:54.160 --> 04:56.640
She didn't munch on any brains.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.487
- Well, who's the witness?
- Montana state trooper. Twenty-year vet.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.565
Checked his pulse. Saw his insides
spilled out all over the place.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.609
Announced him dead with a capital D.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.565
Since when have the feds
started tracking zombie activity?

05:26.040 --> 05:29.328
We don't track zombie activity
because there's no such thing as zombies.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.811
Uh-huh.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.810
- Why don't you tell us what you saw?
- Article said it all.

05:33.960 --> 05:38.602
Dead as dog poop.
Guts pecked out, face frozen.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.764
People don't walk away from that.
Zombies do.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.088
You don't think something
dragged him away?

05:45.280 --> 05:48.124
One set of footprints. No drag marks.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.641
- You didn't go after him?
- That's grizzly country.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.280
You couldn't pay me enough
to hike those woods.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.408
Not without a bazooka.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.609
Uh, Jack? I got something here.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.522
It came across the wire from Livingston.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.249
"John Doe,
presumably mauled by a grizzly."

06:08.200 --> 06:09.929
Holy crap, that's him.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.082
- That's the dead guy?
- Dead my ass.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.925
That's a zombie, boys.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.209
Uh, you know what, trooper?
Why don't you stay here?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.330
We'll take care of this.
We need someone to hold down the fort

06:21.520 --> 06:23.204
- You sure?
- Yeah.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.688
And if things go all Dawn of the Dead
on us, you'll be our first call.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.765
Boys.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.246
Aim for the head.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.044
No ID on this guy?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.123
Fingerprints came up blank too.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.082
- What's going on down here?
- Liver was eaten.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.163
Best guess is a bird got at it.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.685
Hm.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.003
I gotta say, I am a little disappointed.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.561
Because you wanted to shoot zombies.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.484
Damn straight I wanted
to shoot some zombies.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.047
This is about as open and shut
as it gets, all right?

07:13.240 --> 07:15.766
Guy gets Mack-Trucked,
goes down for a nap, wakes up...

07:15.920 --> 07:18.924
...takes a detour into Mama Bear's den.
End of story.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.326
Then why would he run?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.248
He was injured.
That trooper could've helped him.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.765
I don't know. Shady past?

07:26.680 --> 07:29.809
Don't guys with a shady past
usually have a fingerprint on file?

07:29.960 --> 07:33.009
Whatever it was,
the guy's dead now. All right?

07:33.200 --> 07:36.886
Remember what Bobby said? Hm?
Wood chipper beats everything? Yeah.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.327
Well, so does grizzly bear...

07:43.680 --> 07:45.728
- Unh!
- You better start talking.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.167
What are you?
And if you say zombie, I swear...

07:48.360 --> 07:50.283
What? No, I'm not anything.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.364
Two minutes ago, you were
room temperature. You're something.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.921
I don't know what I am, okay?
I don't know who I am.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.884
All I know is all I do is die.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.606
So if you want to shoot me, shoot me.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.764
Promise me you'll finish the job
because I can't take this anymore.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.451
All right, get up, get
up, get up, stand up.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.171
All you do is die?
What's that supposed to mean?

08:15.640 --> 08:18.246
Once a day, for as long as I can remember.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.562
After a few hours, I'm back.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.129
What, are you like a real life Kenny?

08:23.520 --> 08:24.646
Who?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.324
No, my name is Shane.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.484
All right. Shane, we're not gonna find out
what you are in here.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.326
You come with us. We're gonna run
a few tests, make sure everything's kosher.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.686
Tests?

08:38.320 --> 08:39.924
Aah!

08:40.159 --> 08:43.448
Seriously? This is FBI-sanctioned?

08:44.360 --> 08:45.850
Drink.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.045
All right. So, uh, how long
has this dying thing been going on?

08:55.960 --> 08:59.726
Long as I can remember.
But my memory only goes back a few years.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.123
Wait, so now you have amnesia?
How do you know your name?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.282
My real name isn't Shane.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.690
It was given to me because, I don't know,
people had to call me something.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.401
- Okay. So then what happened to you?
- Got pulled off a mountain in Europe.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.688
They said that I got
caught in an avalanche.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.771
I don't remember anything
from before the rescue.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.288
When I realized my condition,
I knew I couldn't be around other people.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.125
I built a little cabin, learned to hunt,
kept to myself.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.481
Seemed easiest that way.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.844
A couple pot growers grew nervous
with me being near their crop.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.447
Shot me. Twice.
Figured it was time to move on.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.329
Right into the grill of that pickup.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.088
- You think maybe I could clean up?
- Yeah. Knock yourself out.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.009
Well, he's definitely something.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.289
Yeah, but maybe he's not the monster.
Maybe he's the victim.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.364
- You thinking curse?
- Could be looking for a witch. Yeah.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.608
You know what?
He's parked here, he's safe.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.684
Maybe we should get another room
until we can figure this out.

10:05.840 --> 10:10.129
All right, but you're the one
going full-cavity for the hex bag.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.564
Who are you?

10:48.240 --> 10:49.730
You don't remember?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.009
Never mind.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.965
Who are you?

11:41.520 --> 11:43.363
Now?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.364
I'm your worst enemy.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.801
Who the hell was that?

11:52.960 --> 11:54.849
She... She said that she knew me.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.007
Yeah. How?

11:58.480 --> 12:03.361
I don't know, but, uh, I could have sworn
that she was upset I didn't know her back.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.205
This is a lot more than a curse.
You've got some tiger blood.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.646
Where'd you learn that kung fu?

12:09.640 --> 12:12.530
- Hey, buddy, you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.409
I just need a minute.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.483
I've never been in a fight my whole life.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.008
Whoa. Hey. Hey, pal. Hey. Are you...?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.326
Hey. Whoa.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.642
- Is he having a heart attack?
- Do we call 911?

12:26.800 --> 12:30.646
And tell them the dead guy we stole from
the morgue is alive and having a coronary?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.561
I feel like I'm sitting shivah.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.521
Well, that's not... Never mind.
Um, we need to think, Dean.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.765
What do we know of that has, uh,
Jason Bourne fighting skills...

12:52.920 --> 12:55.127
...dies a lot...

12:55.280 --> 12:57.362
...and has a history with violent women?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.530
I don't know, you?

13:23.200 --> 13:26.647
- May I help you?
- Agent Bonham?

13:27.800 --> 13:31.691
- And you are?
- This is going to sound really strange...

13:31.840 --> 13:34.764
...but I'm looking for a corpse
that went missing today.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.083
The coroner said that
you were the last one to see it.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.082
/'93'

13:42.840 --> 13:46.083
Uh, this is Agent Jones.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.209
Why are you looking for our John Doe?

13:49.800 --> 13:50.961
Well, his name is Shane.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.362
At least that's what I called him.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.128
I'm the mother of his son.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.010
Hey.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.730
Why don't you, uh, slap me some skin, huh?

14:05.880 --> 14:06.927
He's shy.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.082
It's okay, Oliver.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.091
- Oh, you weren't supposed to see...
- It's okay.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.811
Stay with the nice FBI agents, Oliver.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.970
Hey.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.201
When I was younger...

14:32.360 --> 14:34.931
...I had friends that wanted to climb
this mountain in Europe...

14:35.080 --> 14:39.005
and I thought it sounded exciting
so I joined them.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.525
The avalanche.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.040
He told you?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.689
What else did he say?

14:45.840 --> 14:48.241
Just that he doesn't remember
how he got there.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.684
My friends were gone.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.366
And when I found him,
his clothes were torn off...

14:54.520 --> 14:57.763
...his eyes were frozen solid,
but he was still alive.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.802
I just knew there was something off
about him, the way that he would...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.161
Die every day?

15:07.160 --> 15:08.207
Yeah.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.043
I thought it was from exposure or shock,
maybe he was unconscious.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.804
We were both in bad shape.

15:15.280 --> 15:19.285
And I know I couldn't have made it down
the mountain if it weren't for him.

15:20.280 --> 15:25.571
And when we got to the bottom, we, uh,
realized that it had become something else.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.521
And we spent the night together,
and while we were, you know...

15:30.080 --> 15:31.411
...he had a heart attack.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.969
Awkward.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.043
So I called 911, and
they couldn't save him.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.567
And I had to go down to ID the body...

15:42.720 --> 15:45.485
He popped up again, alive.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.650
I freaked out and I ran.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.286
And nine months later, I had Oliver.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.131
I hired a private investigator.
I really tried to find him.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.363
But when they gave up, I gave up.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.842
- Until a couple of months ago.
- Now, what made you look again?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.444
The worst thing.

16:22.400 --> 16:23.481
Hayley?

16:26.600 --> 16:27.840
Hello, Shane.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.049
Oliver? Come here, honey.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.484
I thought it was time you two meet.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.241
This is Oliver.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.649
Did you find anything?

17:02.160 --> 17:06.608
Well, uh, looks like we were right
about that curse thing.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.404
From what I can tell,
we're looking at a Titan.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.608
Titan? What is that, like a god?

17:12.800 --> 17:16.406
More like a proto-god.
Like, the gods before the gods.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.040
Look, they ruled over Greece
before Zeus...

17:19.200 --> 17:22.010
...and the rest of the Olympian gods
overthrew them.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.969
Okay. So who is this guy?

17:24.119 --> 17:25.645
Best I can tell?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.925
Prometheus.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.368
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.326
- Didn't he steal fire or something?
- Yep.

17:34.480 --> 17:38.724
He, uh, Ocean's Eleven'd Mount Olympus
and stole the flames of Olympia.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.211
For what? Kicks?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.169
For us, actually.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.130
Zeus decided to revoke
humanity's ability to make fire.

17:45.320 --> 17:49.405
So we couldn't cook, couldn't stay warm,
couldn't see in the dark.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.803
Sounds like a monster's paradise.
And this guy made it right for us?

17:52.960 --> 17:56.009
Yeah. And in return, Zeus decided
to strap him to that mountain...

17:56.160 --> 17:58.242
...and make him relive death every day.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.448
Damn. Every day for how long?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.166
No wonder the guy's hard drive is fried.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.363
Did you figure out who, uh,
Xena-wannabe was?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.324
I'm guessing Artemis, Zeus' daughter.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.921
She's known to carry around weapons
like that dagger.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.651
They're nasty. They'll kill immortals dead.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.970
All right. Well, we've never battled
a god curse before.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.128
Hope we can break it.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.766
This is an eagle
chowing down on your intestines.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.884
You don't remember that?

18:29.600 --> 18:31.125
No.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.602
Okay, look, I hate to break it to you,
but you are Prometheus.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.163
Then the best thing for me is
to get as far away from them as I can.

18:39.360 --> 18:43.365
I'm sorry. You just discovered that you have
a 7-year-old son and you wanna walk away?

18:43.520 --> 18:47.809
I'm a god. And this god and his daughter
are hunting me. What chance do I have?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.531
Okay. We're gonna help you.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.445
But we need a plan first.
We can't come up with one here.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.121
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.843
- What's wrong?
- He fell.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.402
- Do I need to call an ambulance?
- No, don't.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.243
He's dying, isn't he?

19:11.600 --> 19:14.604
I was going to tell you.
I wanted you to have a chance to adjust.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.922
Wait a second. He has your curse?

19:18.280 --> 19:19.441
What curse?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.331
Just put him right here.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.370
- This curse was put on you. Why the kid?
- I don't know.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.161
- You keep saying "curse." What curse?
- How long has this been happening?

19:50.320 --> 19:52.322
Since he turned 7 a few months ago.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.649
Started with the dying,
then he stopped talking.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.529
Wait, 7?

19:57.040 --> 20:00.089
Age 7 marks one of the first
Greek rites of manhood.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.925
So, what are you saying?
The curse is in his programming?

20:03.080 --> 20:04.730
How do you know that?

20:05.520 --> 20:09.002
Look at me. I'm sorry that I ran out on you
all those years ago.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.721
I was scared.
I didn't understand what was going on.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.168
But we have a child,
and whatever you have, he has.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.089
I need to know how to stop it.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.485
What curse?

20:26.360 --> 20:32.845
Okay. So Ollie's dad is a Greek god who
has been cursed to die every day by Zeus.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.409
And you guys are ghostbusters.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.130
Am I getting this right? Heh.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.408
Due to the fact that
your son is currently...

20:41.560 --> 20:44.530
...albeit temporarily, dead,
I'm gonna let that one slide.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.768
You have to realize this sounds crazy.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.561
It's true. Didn't believe it myself,
but it's the only thing that makes sense.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.202
The faster you wrap your brain around this,
the faster we solve the problem.

20:54.360 --> 20:58.046
Solve the problem? I'm just not even sure
I understand the problem.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.725
All right.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.327
So the way we usually handle this
is we summon the bastard...

21:03.560 --> 21:06.086
...and we work him over
until he undoes whatever he did.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.568
Summon Zeus?

21:08.720 --> 21:10.927
- Yes.
- And if he doesn't wanna undo it?

21:11.160 --> 21:12.730
Then we take him out.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.087
And hopefully the curse
dies along with him.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.929
This can't be happening.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.122
This I... I can handle.

21:31.240 --> 21:36.121
Listen, you can run and hide
and die for all eternity, it's your choice.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.681
But Sam and I are gonna go after Zeus.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.603
With or without you.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.887
I'm in

22:13.120 --> 22:15.441
- Here we go.
- What you got?

22:15.640 --> 22:17.642
Dragon penis.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.290
What?

22:20.320 --> 22:21.401
Heh.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.201
Ancient Greek hunter...

22:24.400 --> 22:26.880
...by the name of, uh, Drakopoolos.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.482
Near as I can tell, he was a badass.
Whose name, incidentally, is Greek...

22:30.640 --> 22:32.847
No, no, no. I got that. Thanks, Ace.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.725
Hey.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.406
How's the, uh...? How's the kid?

22:39.560 --> 22:41.210
He's fine.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.927
Oh, please. Keep going.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.321
Right. So, uh, Drakopoolos
tangled with Zeus back in the day...

22:49.480 --> 22:51.847
...and the Men of Letters
translated his journal.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.366
The Men of Letters?

22:53.920 --> 22:56.002
It's a secret society.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.685
This is actually their lair.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.845
We're legacies.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.001
No big deal.

23:08.800 --> 23:14.170
Okay. So it says here he summoned Zeus
into a trap and found out how to kill him.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.367
What's that?

23:15.520 --> 23:19.127
Wood. From a tree struck by lightning.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.203
It says we need two things
for the summon:

23:21.360 --> 23:24.967
Frozen energy from the hand of Zeus
and the bone of a worshipper.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.489
- Frozen energy? You thinking fulgurite?
- Well, it makes sense.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.008
Get on the web, see if there's any Greeks
still worshipping the old gods.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.207
On it.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.966
What about the wood? Is that easy to find?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.447
With a little bit of luck.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.326
- Oh. But the... This journal just ends.
- What do you mean?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.807
I mean, how do we know
if Drako-whatever survived?

23:43.960 --> 23:46.884
- How do we know Zeus didn't get to him?
- We don't know.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.803
- How do we know this is going to work?
- We never know.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.361
But these books, they're, uh...
They're pretty good.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.730
So we're hanging our lives
on the writings of a dead man...

23:57.880 --> 24:00.360
...who is named after genitalia?

24:01.160 --> 24:03.003
It's a loose translation.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.720
Experts.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.251
All right, listen to this.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.721
Greek pagans, two towns over.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.720
Best part? They have an obit page.
With cemeteries.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.008
All right. You two are on grave duty.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.084
- We'll handle the B and E.
- We'll be in touch.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.921
Hey.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.082
B and E? You mean breaking and entering?
Ahem. What for?

24:25.240 --> 24:28.449
Well, the book calls for fulgurite.
It's a little hard to come by.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.365
The last time we needed it,
we stole it from a 1-percenter.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.764
You do know that fulgurite is available
in crystal shops all over, right?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.601
- Really?
- Yeah. The New Age people...

24:39.800 --> 24:41.404
...they use it to make cheap jewelry.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.767
Hm.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.722
Why are you doing this, Sam?

25:07.280 --> 25:09.965
We need a bone. So I dig.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.166
No, I mean for us.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.251
This isn't your problem,
you're risking your life.

25:17.400 --> 25:20.449
Why'd you risk yours to steal that fire?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.324
Good question.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.889
Wish I could remember.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.651
Trust me on this, it was worth it.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.646
You pretty much, uh,
saved the whole world. Heh.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.487
Yeah, I guess.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.244
But none of that...

25:37.400 --> 25:40.847
None of that means anything
unless I can save my son.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.527
I know this all seems
a little haphazard. All right?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.409
But trust me when I say
that me and Sammy...

26:05.560 --> 26:07.801
...have gone in with a lot less
and come out on top.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.686
I believe you.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.490
It's just all this.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.610
I'm about to ask Zeus...

26:14.800 --> 26:17.406
...the Greek god, to help cure my son.

26:18.520 --> 26:22.206
Thing you gotta remember is this is not
about asking for his help. Okay?

26:22.360 --> 26:23.850
He's not your friend.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.048
It's about getting him to do what's right.

26:40.240 --> 26:41.924
Stay calm.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.889
Oh, come now.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.161
Can't we do this civilized?

27:19.360 --> 27:21.089
Well, it depends on you.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.201
All we need is to break a curse
you put on a little kid.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.324
So how about you say yes
and we all go home?

27:32.320 --> 27:34.687
Nice to see you again, Prometheus.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.724
All cleaned up.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.410
I've been looking for you.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.767
It's gone too far, Zeus.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.401
Break the curse.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.766
It's your child who has the affliction.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.601
Interesting.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.489
So, what's it gonna be?

28:00.640 --> 28:02.688
The easy way?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.803
Or we can do this the hard way.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.367
Break the trap, dear man,
and I'll break the curse.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.204
No dice. Fix the kid.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.006
- Going once...
- Don't be that guy.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.771
- Going twice...
- Hey, you can rot here for all I care.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.203
Yes, and the child will continue to suffer.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.560
Let's roll.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.085
He needs me, and you know it.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.843
No!

28:48.360 --> 28:50.567
- Hayley, no!
- Now save my son.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.366
What do you say?

29:00.840 --> 29:04.561
Shall we try this the hard way?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.326
Bring forth the child.

29:17.280 --> 29:18.805
Please.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.125
Balls.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.721
I trust you've met my daughter.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.131
Hayley, don't do it.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.041
This is the son of Prometheus.

29:48.920 --> 29:53.050
And he's cursed to suffer death every day.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.880
I must admit...

29:55.080 --> 30:00.246
...I could never have conceived such
a horrible fate for such a beautiful child.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.404
Just goes to show...

30:03.040 --> 30:06.362
...we must all leave room
for a happy accident.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.803
What's that mean? I don't understand.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.769
Tell me...

30:10.920 --> 30:13.969
...has Prometheus experienced
the child's death yet?

30:19.120 --> 30:20.406
How did he take it?

30:23.680 --> 30:25.444
Did he hurt?

30:27.720 --> 30:28.926
Good.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.209
Imagine a thousand children...

30:36.040 --> 30:39.522
...all dying in unison.

30:39.680 --> 30:45.130
Only then would you understand my pain.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.525
But we can't always have what we want.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.045
So...

30:53.200 --> 30:54.929
...one will have to do.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.600
No.

31:02.960 --> 31:07.045
I have a special job for you...

31:07.240 --> 31:09.447
...my little friend. Heh-heh-heh.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.331
Artemis.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.884
Move.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.407
Know who this is, Dean,
walking us to our deaths?

31:25.560 --> 31:28.211
- Don't know, don't care.
- It's our god, Artemis.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.687
- The goddess of hunters.
- Wow, that's fascinating.

31:30.840 --> 31:35.482
See, she's who we'd pray to for courage
when hunting the Gorgon or the Minotaur.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.645
Of course she's not really worship-worthy
anymore, having lost a step and all.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.286
The hell I have.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.882
Really, Sam?
You're trash-talking a god? Seriously?

31:49.480 --> 31:53.007
So let's see if we can make up...

31:53.200 --> 31:57.330
...for seven years of lost time.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.049
Still at full power? Really?

32:15.240 --> 32:17.527
Why'd it take you seven years
to track down Prometheus?

32:17.720 --> 32:20.690
- He was hiding.
- Hiding from you?

32:20.840 --> 32:24.208
So the god of hunters
couldn't find a shack in Montana?

32:25.120 --> 32:27.282
Or maybe it's that
you didn't wanna find him?

32:29.520 --> 32:31.249
Good, Sammy. Doing great.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.488
Your dad's gonna kill that kid, you know?

32:33.680 --> 32:36.968
Don't worry, he'll come back.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.330
Unlike you.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.245
He was in love with you, you know.
He told us.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.887
You lie.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.521
Okay, sure, yeah.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.324
Believe whatever you want.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.443
No, no, no.
Don't pass out on me just yet.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.486
I'm only just getting started.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.240
What did he say to you?

33:10.640 --> 33:13.041
This wasn't the first time
he escaped that mountain.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.602
You let him go free as long as you could
hide your tryst from the old man.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.410
The hell he said.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.005
His brain is mush.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.690
Oh, yeah? Then how did I know?

33:21.840 --> 33:24.969
What, have you spilled it to anyone?
Homer? Hesiod?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.650
Herodotus?

33:27.560 --> 33:30.450
Of course not.
You were afraid Big Daddy would find out...

33:30.600 --> 33:33.604
...that you fell for the person
he hates most in this world.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.005
When he saw the zombie article,
it forced your hand.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.891
You had to come hunt him down,
no matter how much it hurt.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.691
You know what? Go ahead, kill us.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.451
And let your father slaughter that boy.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.924
Over...

33:48.080 --> 33:49.445
...and over again.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.611
That won't leave a mark.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.050
You like being an immortal, don't you?

33:57.800 --> 34:03.807
Oh, sure, you die every day,
but nothing can keep you dead.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.288
It's almost like taking a little nap.

34:09.520 --> 34:13.491
All of your cares and worries
disappear for a little while.

34:14.120 --> 34:19.047
Well, it's sleepy time, my dear boy.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.848
This has to stop, Father.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.164
Stop?

34:31.719 --> 34:34.451
I'm only just getting started.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.085
You've done enough.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.203
I am doing this for us.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.721
For our kind.

34:41.920 --> 34:46.562
He is the reason we're here
and not ruling the world.

34:46.760 --> 34:50.685
He is the reason
they have forgotten all about us.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.723
Let them go.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.290
All of them.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.164
I am your father...

34:58.760 --> 35:01.047
...and you will obey me.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.162
You were once my father.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.521
Now you're someone else.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.487
I never get tired of watching you die.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.846
Your boy is going on the mountain.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.284
I'm sorry.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.365
You know what?

38:14.240 --> 38:16.402
How about we go get
some ice cream sundaes?

38:18.880 --> 38:22.202
No, I'd like to stay.

38:42.520 --> 38:47.367
Well, uh, here's to that crazy little
wild card called love.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.370
How'd you know Artemis had the hots
for Prometheus, anyway?

38:51.320 --> 38:52.367
Intuition.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.285
Uh, luck. Heh.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.608
Yeah, well, whatever it was, it worked.

38:57.760 --> 39:00.445
Pretty much. At least the kid's all right.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.811
You know...

39:06.760 --> 39:09.730
...I'm starting to think
maybe I was being naive.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.924
What are you talking about?

39:14.120 --> 39:19.763
When I said that I could just will myself
into coming out of these trials unscathed.

39:21.120 --> 39:25.409
No, no, no. Stop the sullen emo
crap, all right? That's...

39:25.560 --> 39:29.007
- You're not gonna die like Prometheus.
- How do you know, Dean?

39:29.240 --> 39:33.290
Bobby? Rufus? Now Prometheus?
You think any of them chose death?

39:33.440 --> 39:37.081
No, the life chose for them.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.123
Yeah, well, you promised, okay?

39:39.280 --> 39:41.806
You promised to live a long
Clark Griswold life...

39:41.960 --> 39:44.122
...full of prostate exams
and colonoscopies.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.648
All right? You're not welshing
on that deal. Not on my watch.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.724
If you die, it's gonna be
because of something normal.

39:52.720 --> 39:56.167
- Like a heart attack?
- Exactly.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.724
Yeah, eat your burger.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.841
Cass, you got your ears on?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.690
Listen, you know I'm not one for praying...

40:31.680 --> 40:33.682
...because in my book...

40:33.840 --> 40:36.161
...it's the same as begging.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.841
But this is about Sam,
so I need you to hear me.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.211
We are going into this deal blind...

40:50.520 --> 40:52.522
...and I don't know what's ahead...

40:53.560 --> 40:56.006
...or what it's gonna bring for Sam.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.281
Now, he's covering pretty good,
but I know that he is hurting.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.804
And this one was supposed to be on me.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.167
So for all that we've been through...

41:15.800 --> 41:17.802
...I'm asking you...

41:21.120 --> 41:24.329
...you keep a look out
for my little brother, okay?

41:38.640 --> 41:40.847
Where the hell are you, man?
