00:04.571 --> 00:06.205
This is sick.                   

00:06.272 --> 00:07.873
Just stop harassing me.

to contact me

one more time,                  

00:12.812 --> 00:14.480
I'm gonna turn you over         
to the authorities!

00:17.050 --> 00:19.184
            Which one of your   
                  kids was that?

00:19.285 --> 00:20.919
  That was not one of my kids.  

00:20.987 --> 00:22.855
    I don't talk to my kids     
        that way.               

00:22.922 --> 00:24.623
Bill collector, then, huh?      
No,                             

00:24.691 --> 00:25.991
    it was my mother.           

00:26.126 --> 00:27.960
Her Social Security check       

00:28.028 --> 00:31.830
  is late, like it's my fault   
    she's getting old.          

00:35.335 --> 00:37.336
Did you hear the way            
she talked to her mother?       

00:37.404 --> 00:39.905
I could never talk              
to my mother like that.         

00:39.973 --> 00:43.042
          Hey, Carla,           
 could you give my mom a call?

02:02.222 --> 02:03.756
     you're here, let's go.     

02:03.823 --> 02:05.024
            All right, Sam, what
             is the big mystery?

02:05.091 --> 02:06.625
        Where are you taking us?

02:06.693 --> 02:08.660
Oh, I wanted to have it be      
        a big surprise,         

02:08.728 --> 02:10.529
      but I can't keep it       
     to myself any longer.      

02:10.630 --> 02:12.598
              Freddie, who would
                 you like to see

        Somebody hand me a blunt
             instrument, please.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.420
                    Here you go.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.622
            Use it label-side-up
            so it doesn't crack.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.623
Thanks, you're a doll.          

02:37.691 --> 02:38.824
      Look,                     

02:38.892 --> 02:40.793
         you kids, uh,          
 go to the concert without me.  

02:40.860 --> 02:43.028
Frasier, this is                
Frederick's first concert.      

02:43.129 --> 02:45.497
Yes, and this is my bugging out 
 of Frederick's first concert.  

02:45.565 --> 02:46.799
                        I intend
                      to do this

02:46.866 --> 02:49.068
all through his childhood       
    and teenage years.          

02:49.135 --> 02:51.337
         Then, finally,         
    when he's in his mid-20s    

02:51.404 --> 02:52.938
                    and he comes
                 to me and says,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.874
          "Father, let's go hear
    Bobby Short at the Carlyle,"

02:55.942 --> 02:59.411
        I'll turn and say, "Son,
            now you're talking."

02:59.512 --> 03:02.147
Frasier, you're missing the     
whole point of this concert.    

03:02.215 --> 03:04.049
The show for us                 
is not on the stage.            

03:04.117 --> 03:06.685
It's in the delighted eyes      
of your child.                  

03:06.753 --> 03:09.922
      Oh, right, delighted eyes,
     shiny face, yada yada yada.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.924
                  Well, let's go
                    see Nanny G.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.692
SAM:                            
Come on.                        
Nanny G?                        

03:13.760 --> 03:17.563
I saw her Itsy Bitsy World      
concert and fell in love.       

03:17.630 --> 03:19.598
Her in a peasant blouse...      

03:19.666 --> 03:23.002
  boing!                        

03:23.069 --> 03:24.136
         I just don't understand

03:24.204 --> 03:25.471
                why people don't
        expose their children   

03:25.538 --> 03:26.605
          to good music anymore.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.874
            When I was a lad, my
          parents took me to see

03:28.942 --> 03:30.876
             <i>Peter and The Wolf,</i>
           <i>The Nutcracker Suite,</i>

03:30.944 --> 03:32.578
               <i>Swan Lake,</i> not...

03:32.645 --> 03:33.612
        ¶ Tickle your tummy ¶   

03:33.680 --> 03:35.047
¶ Life is kind of yummy. ¶      

03:35.115 --> 03:36.448
  See, it's catchy, isn't it?   

03:36.516 --> 03:39.418
Well, sure, when I do it, but   
      I can sing the phone book.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.395
Hey, guys, how you doing?       
SAM:                            
Hey, Woodrow.                   

03:49.462 --> 03:51.263
        How's it going?         
What are you                    
doing here, man?                

03:51.364 --> 03:52.865
    Eh, took a chance,          
    called a scalper.           

03:52.932 --> 03:54.233
          Money talks.          

03:54.300 --> 03:56.068
That's great.                   
Where are you sitting?          

03:56.136 --> 03:59.204
Oh, I'm up in the second balcony
     next to the last row.      

03:59.272 --> 04:00.806
                At least I'm not
                in the last row.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.441
      Those poor suckers.       

04:02.509 --> 04:03.776

Oh.                             

04:03.843 --> 04:06.578
                 Say, uh, <i>these</i> 
                 are nice seats.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.213
         Aren't they, though?   

04:08.281 --> 04:09.481
                 I don't suppose
              anybody would want

04:09.549 --> 04:11.316
          to trade me.          

04:11.384 --> 04:12.618
        You know,               
    someone who wasn't, say,    

04:12.686 --> 04:15.754
as devoted a lifelong fan       
            as I am.            

04:15.822 --> 04:17.623
                            Sam?

04:17.724 --> 04:19.324
    You could at least          
    make eye contact.           

04:20.793 --> 04:22.561
              Hey, Freddie, I'll
             give you ten bucks.
    Woody.

                    be quiet.

                            Who?

 Uh, I was just talking to Sam. 

05:29.396 --> 05:30.696
            And what were you   
                  saying to Sam?

05:30.897 --> 05:31.997
Your first wife?                

05:32.065 --> 05:33.032
Wow.

    Isn't that a kick?

                your first wife.

Daddies, you all stand up       
    and clap with me.

              What else have you
            lied to me about?   

05:48.882 --> 05:51.884

I didn't tell you.              

05:51.951 --> 05:54.319
I just couldn't seem            
to find the right time.

I guess                         
I-I just loved you so much      

05:56.022 --> 05:58.257
that you made me forget that    
there ever was another woman.   

05:58.358 --> 06:01.026
                    Oh, serve   
                    it on toast.

06:03.096 --> 06:07.866
Lilith, Nanette and I were,     
we were just kids.              

06:07.934 --> 06:09.034
I was first-year                
med school.                     

06:09.102 --> 06:10.536
It only lasted                  
a few months.                   

06:10.603 --> 06:12.338
Well, I barely                  
remember her.                   

06:12.405 --> 06:15.708
I remember her cat better--     
Bobo Black Paws.                

06:15.775 --> 06:18.711
He used to love to sleep        
on my naked back.               

06:18.778 --> 06:22.748
Oh, God, he used to purr like   
an airplane when we were...     

06:22.816 --> 06:24.149
Shoot,                          
I can't remember.               

06:24.217 --> 06:26.485
It's all gone.                  

06:28.288 --> 06:29.321
    (giggles)                   

06:29.389 --> 06:30.589
     (song ends, cheering)      

06:32.225 --> 06:33.192
            Thanks so much.     

06:35.428 --> 06:36.962
You know what?                  

06:37.030 --> 06:38.564
    My favorite thing           

06:38.631 --> 06:42.935
  in the whole big, wide world  
     is making new friends.     

06:43.003 --> 06:45.804
    (slow intro plays)          
                Oh, I'll bet.   

06:46.906 --> 06:49.108
¶ When you meet someone ¶       

06:49.209 --> 06:52.311
    ¶ Who might become          
      a friend to you... ¶      

06:52.379 --> 06:55.080
            So, Frasier, have   
                you been married

06:55.148 --> 06:57.116
              to any other well-
            known performers?   

06:57.183 --> 07:00.152
            If, for instance, we
        should take Frederick   

07:00.220 --> 07:01.453
                to the circus   
                     next month,

07:01.521 --> 07:05.324
        should I feel threatened
     by Jojo The Dog-Faced Girl?

07:05.392 --> 07:10.029
     ¶ I... want... to... ¶     

07:10.096 --> 07:11.563
     ¶ Shake your hand... ¶     

07:11.631 --> 07:14.500
Lilith, you have got to get     
a handle on this thing.         

07:14.567 --> 07:15.734
The marriage was                
a silly mistake.                

07:15.802 --> 07:17.002
We rectified it.                

07:17.070 --> 07:20.172
We went on with our lives,      
we've never spoken since.       

07:20.240 --> 07:22.941
If we ran into each other       
on the street,                  

07:23.009 --> 07:24.643
she wouldn't know me            
from Adam.                      

07:24.711 --> 07:28.480
  ¶ I want to shake your hand,  
    shake your hand ¶           

07:28.581 --> 07:31.150
        ¶ You and I... ¶        

07:31.217 --> 07:33.986
             Oh, my God. (sighs)

07:34.054 --> 07:35.354
         (music stops)          

07:41.094 --> 07:43.829
Don't you want                  
to shake my hand?               

07:59.946 --> 08:02.214
She shook everyone's hand.      

08:02.282 --> 08:04.717
    She even kissed some guy    
    in the fourth row.          

08:07.654 --> 08:11.190
They don't shake your hand      
in row YY in the second balcony.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.424
        Oh... no.               

08:12.492 --> 08:14.960
They'll happily charge you      
         $28.50 a pop,          

08:15.028 --> 08:18.931
but that don't buy no handshake 
          in double Y.          

08:18.998 --> 08:22.401
So Frasier was married          
to that-- oh,                   

08:22.469 --> 08:24.770
how would one                   
describe her?                   

08:24.838 --> 08:26.739
 Bitch.                         

08:30.477 --> 08:32.977
Never even told me              
about her.                      

08:33.046 --> 08:35.581
Well, if that's what he wants,  
he can have it.                 

08:35.648 --> 08:39.852
¶ I want to shake your hand,    
snatch you bald ¶               

08:39.953 --> 08:42.621
¶ I want to scratch             
your eyes out ¶                 

08:42.688 --> 08:45.924
  ¶ I want to drain your blood  
and replace it with a... ¶      

08:45.992 --> 08:48.327
      ¶ Mercuric chloride,      
         formaldehyde ¶         

08:48.395 --> 08:50.195
¶ And alcohol solution. ¶       

08:50.263 --> 08:51.597
        (laughing)              

08:54.634 --> 08:56.235
      You had to be there.      

08:59.906 --> 09:03.308
Boy, never seen this side       
    of Lilith before.           

09:03.376 --> 09:05.978
        I like it.              

09:06.046 --> 09:07.880
        Oh, I know              
  what Lilith's going through.  

09:07.947 --> 09:10.349
When I was in high school,      
I used to date this guy--       

09:10.417 --> 09:11.984
         Corky Pasavak.         

09:12.052 --> 09:16.722
He was in drama class, but he,  
but he was still real macho.    

09:16.790 --> 09:18.357
  Anyway, one time he asked me  
      to go to the movies,      

09:18.425 --> 09:20.025
    and when we were walking    
         down the aisle         

09:20.093 --> 09:21.994
we ran into his old girlfriend. 

09:22.062 --> 09:23.328
I don't even know               
why I'm telling                 

09:23.396 --> 09:25.164
          this story;           
  I mean, I'll just end up...   

09:25.231 --> 09:27.032
          (quavering):          
...getting a lump in my throat, 
        trailing off...         

09:27.100 --> 09:29.568
        (sobbing):              
  ...and bursting into tears.   

09:29.636 --> 09:33.405
         Not this time,         
    damn you, not this time!    

09:36.976 --> 09:39.144
              Well, I think that
            was a new record.   

09:39.212 --> 09:41.347
         Where is Lilith?       

09:41.414 --> 09:42.748
She's in the ladies' room.      

09:42.916 --> 09:44.216
                      Hey, Fras,

09:44.317 --> 09:46.085
heard you used to be married    
to a children's singer.         

09:46.152 --> 09:47.119
What's the matter?              

09:47.187 --> 09:49.888
Burl Ives                       
turn you down?                  

09:49.956 --> 09:53.325
  Look, am, am I the only one   
  who was ever married before?  

09:53.393 --> 09:54.960
         It's history,          
    it was a long time ago.     

09:55.028 --> 09:56.729
     So I didn't tell her.      
            So what?            

09:56.830 --> 09:59.198
        Yes, Frasier, but why   
            didn't you tell her?

09:59.265 --> 10:00.866
                            Hmm?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.835
  Marriage is built on trust,   
        you know.               

10:02.902 --> 10:05.270
        You ever told her how   
         you really feel inside?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.006
                Have you ever   
                shared with her?

10:07.073 --> 10:08.907
 Have you ever cried with her?  

10:08.975 --> 10:11.143
      You're right, Norm.       

10:11.211 --> 10:12.644
I should have told her about it.

10:12.712 --> 10:16.348
 I, I'll never forgive myself.  

10:16.416 --> 10:19.251
That was beautiful,             
Normie.                         

10:19.319 --> 10:20.819
Where'd you get it?             

10:20.887 --> 10:22.955
            Last week's <i>Matlock.</i>

10:23.023 --> 10:25.024
            I don't know what he
            got the guy off for,

10:25.091 --> 10:27.292
     but that was his summation.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.463
Oh, it's my first husband.      

10:31.531 --> 10:33.565
    Now, cut that out.          

10:33.633 --> 10:35.467
        Where's my son?         

10:35.535 --> 10:36.502
    Where's Frederick?          

10:36.569 --> 10:38.037
Did you sell him to the gypsies 

10:38.104 --> 10:41.740
  so you could spend more time  
    with Nanny G Spot?          

10:43.810 --> 10:45.110
It was perfectly innocent.      

10:45.178 --> 10:47.746
Oh, Frasier,                    
let's just not talk about it.   

10:47.814 --> 10:49.648
You say it was                  
a youthful indiscretion.        

10:49.716 --> 10:51.216
I'll take you                   
at your word.                   

10:51.284 --> 10:54.319
I can do that because           
I'm secure within myself.       

10:54.421 --> 10:57.289
I've also had                   
a wee bit of Dewar's.           

10:57.357 --> 11:00.592
        So it's...              
     it's really behind us?     

11:00.660 --> 11:03.128
Yes, just don't mention her.    

11:03.196 --> 11:05.330
The chapter is closed.          

11:05.398 --> 11:06.832
             So, in other words,

11:06.900 --> 11:09.735
      you don't want her to come
in here and apologize to you.   

11:09.803 --> 11:10.869
         No.                    
(door opens)                    

11:10.937 --> 11:12.571
              Hi.               

11:12.639 --> 11:14.540
Storm over yet?                 

11:14.607 --> 11:17.309
    Time to make a rainbow?     

11:18.878 --> 11:23.449
Lilith, I'm so sorry            
if I caused you any pain.       

11:23.516 --> 11:25.484
I would have hated it           

11:25.552 --> 11:28.787
if anybody had kissed my husband
    the way I kissed yours.     

11:28.855 --> 11:30.456
I guess                         
I've just always been a...      

11:30.523 --> 11:31.857
                 a kissy person.

11:32.025 --> 11:32.958
                (chuckles)      

11:33.026 --> 11:34.360
A huggy,                        

11:34.527 --> 11:36.328
                kissy person.   

11:36.396 --> 11:38.964
    Give me a big hug.          

11:41.501 --> 11:43.035
    I'd really prefer not to.   

11:43.136 --> 11:46.138
Lilith is not                   
a huggy person.                 

11:46.206 --> 11:50.042
        I know someone who could
      never get enough huggings.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.877
     Well...                    

11:53.546 --> 11:56.849
            Well, I feel like   
              I want to hug you.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.684
  You don't have to hug back.   

12:02.389 --> 12:04.990
(humming)                       

12:05.058 --> 12:07.192
And you didn't.                 

12:07.293 --> 12:09.094
    Nanny G, I was wondering    
        if you could...         

12:09.162 --> 12:11.363
         Lilith, I'd really like
         to make this up to you.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.166
    ...ignore me like           
    a cheap piece of trash.     

12:14.234 --> 12:16.502
                 "Oh, you could?
        Thank you so very much."

12:19.472 --> 12:21.840
            I have a super idea.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.109
         Frasier tells me you're
         having a birthday party

12:24.177 --> 12:25.210
for your little boy tomorrow.   

12:25.278 --> 12:26.645
                  How about if I
                come by and sing

12:26.713 --> 12:27.813
            for the kiddletinos?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.014
            LILITH:             
        Oh, well,               

12:29.082 --> 12:30.649
actually, it's not really       

12:30.717 --> 12:32.117
going to be                     
much of a party.                

12:32.185 --> 12:33.686
 It's just a small              
 <i>family</i> gathering.              

12:33.753 --> 12:35.554
             NORM:              
        Oh, hey, if, uh,        

12:35.622 --> 12:36.889
    Nanny G's going to sing,    
        you know Vera's         

12:36.956 --> 12:38.323
    nieces and nephews would    
         love to come.          

12:38.391 --> 12:39.391
     It is free, isn't it?      

12:39.459 --> 12:40.726
                     Sure is.   
CARLA:                          
Oh!                             

12:40.794 --> 12:42.861
    My God, wait till           
      the twins find out.       

12:42.929 --> 12:44.196
      I'll be their hero.       

12:44.264 --> 12:46.031
     I couldn't get tickets     
        to the concert.         

12:46.099 --> 12:48.534
        Guess I should've tried.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.369
            It's free, right?   

12:50.437 --> 12:52.338
            Actually, as much   
        as I'd love to invite   

12:52.405 --> 12:53.906
                  all of you and
            your little folk,   

12:53.973 --> 12:55.874
the party's going               
to be in our own home,          

12:55.942 --> 12:58.444
and, frankly,                   
it's much too...                

12:58.511 --> 13:00.679
well, I just don't              
want you there.                 

13:02.449 --> 13:04.450
Well, I'll tell you what,       
why don't we have it in the bar?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.085
        Before we open,         
tomorrow morning; it'll be fun. 

13:06.186 --> 13:07.686
  Well, that's settled, then.   

13:07.754 --> 13:08.987
     See you all tomorrow.      

13:09.055 --> 13:12.091
        And don't forget        
     to have goofy dreams.      

13:12.158 --> 13:15.627
You know, most people would make
    that sound corny, but...    

13:15.695 --> 13:17.730
  Yeah, well, I'd better, uh,   
     make some phone calls.     

13:17.797 --> 13:19.365
 I've got a whole neighborhood  
         full of brats.         

13:19.432 --> 13:20.899
  If I bring 'em, they'll, uh,  

13:20.967 --> 13:22.568
        probably tell me        
        where my car is.        

13:24.471 --> 13:27.339
          Darling, are you going
        to be okay with this?   

13:28.575 --> 13:31.043
Am I going to be                
okay with this?                 

13:31.111 --> 13:32.478
Let's see.                      

13:32.545 --> 13:35.314
Earlier today I discovered      
that my husband                 

13:35.382 --> 13:37.783
had an ex-wife                  
he never told me about.         

13:37.851 --> 13:40.085
Then I had the pleasure         
of watching him kiss            

13:40.153 --> 13:42.654
said ex-wife in front           
of a thousand children,         

13:42.722 --> 13:43.956
including his own.              

13:44.024 --> 13:46.525
Then, to top it all off,        
she hugged me.                  

13:46.593 --> 13:48.927
Can you deduce from my tone     
whether or not                  

13:48.995 --> 13:51.397
I'm going to be                 
okay with this?                 

13:51.464 --> 13:54.066
      Baby, you're the greatest.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.674
Pretty good eats,               
huh, Norm?                      

14:01.741 --> 14:03.008
  Not bad for a two-year-old.   

14:04.411 --> 14:06.211
 I, myself, have been enjoying  
    these teeny little          

14:06.279 --> 14:09.515
tuna fish sandwiches shaped like
     tiny little dinosaurs.     

14:09.582 --> 14:12.951
Yeah, quite ironic              
actually, uh,                   

14:13.019 --> 14:16.188
seeing as how tuna, known       
in Latin as <i>Pisces</i> <i>middayicus--</i> 

14:16.256 --> 14:19.091
roughly translated              
as "lunch fish"--               

14:19.159 --> 14:23.328
was, uh, was not                
a contemporary of the, uh,      

14:23.396 --> 14:25.330
prehistoric reptilian           
land wanderers.                 

14:26.533 --> 14:28.067
                Hi, pal.        

14:28.134 --> 14:29.635
                You want some   
                    apple juice?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.670
                Okay.           

14:31.771 --> 14:34.340
 Frasier, where's the Nanster?  

14:34.407 --> 14:35.641
      Oh, she'll be here.       

14:35.709 --> 14:37.710
You can always count on Nanette.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.645
      You know, I, I can't      
            get over            

14:39.713 --> 14:41.780
          her becoming          
        such a big star!        

14:41.848 --> 14:44.450
      Although she always       
     had a gorgeous voice.      

14:44.517 --> 14:47.319
        Personality... God,     
    she'd light up a room       

14:47.387 --> 14:49.021
            when she entered it.
    Really?                     

14:49.089 --> 14:52.358
        I wasn't making a direct
    comparison, dear. It's...   

14:52.425 --> 14:55.060
        You and, you and Nanette
         are apples and oranges.

14:55.128 --> 14:58.497
              But you are by far
the finer of the two produce.   

14:58.565 --> 15:00.632
  And which one would that be?  

15:00.700 --> 15:04.203
            Uh... app-ranges.   

15:05.839 --> 15:08.307
    Look, allow me to preempt   
          any further discussion

15:08.375 --> 15:09.975
        by simply saying that   

15:10.043 --> 15:12.811
                you are the love
                     of my life.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.180
                     And nobody,
            nobody could ever   

15:15.248 --> 15:17.683
                pry my eyes from
            your beautiful face.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.852
                     She's here!
                     She's here!

15:19.919 --> 15:22.154
        (applause)              
            Hi.                 

15:24.224 --> 15:27.760
 ¶ Who is turning two today? ¶  

15:27.827 --> 15:30.362
  ¶ Who today is two today? ¶   

15:30.430 --> 15:34.800
¶ Freddie's turning two today ¶ 

15:34.868 --> 15:37.670
          ¶ Hoo-de-hoo          
de-hoodley-hoodley-hoo today. ¶ 

15:37.737 --> 15:38.871
        (applause)              

15:38.938 --> 15:40.639
FRASIER:                        
Isn't she wonderful?            

15:40.707 --> 15:43.342
You know, I used                
to be married to her.           

15:43.410 --> 15:45.344
But now I've got                
this honey.                     

15:48.415 --> 15:49.915
Happy birthday, Freddie!        

15:50.016 --> 15:51.617
And...                          

15:51.685 --> 15:53.952
          a big hello           
    to the birthday mother.     

15:55.755 --> 15:57.890
            Great, now I'm going
    to smell like gingerbread   

15:57.957 --> 15:59.558
        for the rest of the day.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.926
            Cliffie.            

16:00.994 --> 16:03.128
  Huh?                          
          You smell gingerbread?

16:03.196 --> 16:05.130
Yeah, let's                     
hunt it down.                   

16:12.939 --> 16:15.474
        My goodness, Frasier.   

16:15.542 --> 16:18.911
        I can't believe you have
      such a big, wonderful boy.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.380
                Frasier and I   
                weren't together

16:21.448 --> 16:23.115
             long enough to have
                any children.   

16:23.216 --> 16:25.384
            Although we sure did
        try a lot, didn't we?   

16:27.487 --> 16:29.955
I, uh, I don't remember.        

16:32.058 --> 16:34.226
             I do.              

16:34.294 --> 16:35.427
         Hey, Nanny G.          

16:35.495 --> 16:37.363
             Hi, I'm Carla.     
Hi, hello.                      

16:37.430 --> 16:38.464
         And these are my twins,

16:38.565 --> 16:39.598
        Jesse and Elvis.        

16:39.666 --> 16:41.600
My, they're glorious.           
        Thanks, thanks.         

16:41.668 --> 16:42.801
        They're a little shy,   

16:42.869 --> 16:44.803
            but they'd both like
        an autographed album.   

16:44.871 --> 16:46.805
  Why, sure.                    

16:46.873 --> 16:49.575
"Love, Nanny G."                
It's for you.                   

16:51.244 --> 16:53.679
Would you like an autographed   
album for your little girl?     

16:53.747 --> 16:54.947
            Oh, that's so sweet.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.082
Twenty bucks.                   

16:58.184 --> 17:00.986
        They grow up so fast.   

17:04.858 --> 17:07.726
Oh, sure, she's got lots of time
 to hook the <i>little</i> consumers.  

17:07.794 --> 17:09.461
                Oh, Woody.      

17:09.529 --> 17:12.498
      Have a Fruit Loop necklace
        and chill out, will you?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.266
                      Come here.
                      Come here.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.501
                Say, Nanny G?   

17:15.568 --> 17:16.801
                    Yes?        
             Somebody here wants

17:16.869 --> 17:18.971
                    to meet you.
            Come on, come on.   
Oh, no, Sam,                    

17:19.039 --> 17:20.705
you don't have to introduce us. 

17:20.773 --> 17:22.340
I recognize this fellow.        

17:22.409 --> 17:24.810
The next to last row            
of the balcony,                 

17:24.877 --> 17:27.445
      section YY.               

17:27.513 --> 17:29.381
 I couldn't forget your smile.  

17:29.482 --> 17:31.483
Although I haven't              
seen it since.                  

17:32.719 --> 17:34.486
          There it is!          

17:34.554 --> 17:36.955
                    I, I...     

17:37.023 --> 17:38.857
            I love you, Nanny G!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.733
    You think he bought it?     

17:47.801 --> 17:49.101
        Yeah, he's an easy sale.
    Good.                       

17:56.910 --> 17:59.311
Hey, no cuts!                   

17:59.379 --> 18:01.246
                      You're not
                 the boss of me.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.857
You like that stool?            

18:11.925 --> 18:13.859
                  Yep.          

18:15.028 --> 18:16.628
Drink pretty good there?        

18:16.696 --> 18:18.630
                 Yep.           

18:21.368 --> 18:23.869
Tell you what, kiddo...         

18:25.939 --> 18:27.206
Here you go, scoot, go on.      

18:28.441 --> 18:29.808
          Wish someone          
would've done that for me       

18:29.876 --> 18:31.477
  when I was seven years old.   

18:33.713 --> 18:36.949
    Mommies, daddies,           
    boys and girls...           

18:37.050 --> 18:39.651
half a bar full of people       
I've never seen before...       

18:39.719 --> 18:41.720
I'd like you to gather          
around here at the steps        

18:41.788 --> 18:45.024
for a special sing-along        
with Nanny G.                   

18:45.091 --> 18:46.658
                She saw me!     

18:46.726 --> 18:49.361
    She saw me in the theatre   
      from a hundred miles away.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.164
                    She's magic.
            Nanny G is magic!   

18:52.232 --> 18:54.266
    Get a life.                 

19:02.509 --> 19:05.177
    Well, my, my,               
    my, oh, my.                 

19:05.245 --> 19:07.379
    Well, I was going           
      to start by singing       

19:07.447 --> 19:09.081
     "The Doodle Bug Song."     

19:09.149 --> 19:11.450
    (cheering and applause)     

19:11.518 --> 19:12.818
  Thank you.                    
  Thank you.                    

19:13.019 --> 19:14.286
But instead,                    

19:14.354 --> 19:16.055
I want to begin by singing      

19:16.122 --> 19:18.724
      a very special song       

19:18.792 --> 19:21.760
for a very wonderful boy.       

19:25.365 --> 19:29.234
¶ The first time ¶              

19:29.302 --> 19:34.173
¶ Ever I saw your face ¶        

19:36.076 --> 19:41.947
    ¶ I thought the sun rose    
         in your eyes ¶         

19:42.015 --> 19:43.182
¶ And the moon... ¶             

19:43.249 --> 19:45.284
              Why is she looking
                directly at you?

19:45.352 --> 19:46.819
    She isn't looking at me.    

19:46.886 --> 19:49.488
  She's looking in the general  
direction of our loving family. 

19:49.556 --> 19:52.491
        I think she's singing   
    the song to you, Frasier.   

19:52.559 --> 19:53.892
Oh, you're being paranoid.      

19:53.960 --> 19:56.862
  She's singing a lovely song   
    to a two-year-old child.    

19:56.930 --> 20:01.333
    ¶ The first time ¶          

20:01.401 --> 20:04.169
¶ Ever I lay with you... ¶      

20:04.270 --> 20:05.404
                      All right!
                      That's it!

20:05.472 --> 20:06.472
                 Stop the music!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.407
      Leave my man alone!       

20:08.475 --> 20:10.009
I'm sorry,                      
I can't help it.                

20:10.076 --> 20:12.077
      Frasier, I've never       
      stopped loving you.       

20:12.145 --> 20:13.412
Well, maybe this'll help!       

20:13.480 --> 20:14.613
        (groans)                

20:17.684 --> 20:19.451
          Girl fight!           
          Girl fight!           

20:22.689 --> 20:25.357
 You know, I'm going to suffer  
    for this tomorrow,          

20:25.425 --> 20:28.327
     but today, right now,      
    this exact moment,          

20:28.395 --> 20:30.529
 I'm the happiest man on Earth. 

20:30.597 --> 20:32.364
             Girls!             

20:36.536 --> 20:39.004
  Well, Lilith, the bleeding's  
        finally stopped.        

20:39.072 --> 20:40.339
          (whistles):           
    Those head wounds.          

20:41.675 --> 20:42.808
Serves you right                
for trying                      

20:42.876 --> 20:44.610
    to get between us.          

20:44.678 --> 20:47.212
Darling, I, I had to stop       
the two of you.                 

20:48.114 --> 20:49.682
    Although I must say I was   

20:49.749 --> 20:51.917
                proud to see you
                fight for me.   

20:51.985 --> 20:54.219
    It made me feel so loved.   

20:54.287 --> 20:57.623
              Of course, Nanette
        was pretty vicious, too.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.159
                Oh, but you were
        by far the most vicious.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.327
Thank you.                      

21:02.395 --> 21:03.729
                 Lilith, I...   

21:03.797 --> 21:04.897
          I should have told you

21:04.964 --> 21:07.266
                  about my first
         marriage before, but...

21:07.334 --> 21:09.134
                I just didn't   
                    think it was

21:09.202 --> 21:11.070
                 relevant to our
                    lives today.

21:11.137 --> 21:14.673
Frasier, I know                 
why you didn't tell me.         

21:14.741 --> 21:17.643
You didn't tell me because      
you're a craven coward.         

21:17.711 --> 21:20.379
            You know me so well,
            it's frightening.   

21:24.751 --> 21:27.586
        Can you ever forgive me?

21:27.654 --> 21:29.555
I suppose I'll have to.         

21:31.591 --> 21:34.893
     You know, if I must say so,
you hug better than she does.   

21:34.961 --> 21:36.862
Frasier, you're such a toady.   

21:36.930 --> 21:38.864
        Yes, but I'm your toady.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.900
      Dr. Crane, I didn't       
     want to interrupt you      

21:41.968 --> 21:44.069
        while you were bleeding,
    but, uh, I found this box   

21:44.137 --> 21:45.371
                  underneath one
        of the tables over there

21:45.438 --> 21:48.107
     when I was sweeping up     
        Nanny G's hair.         

21:49.442 --> 21:51.410
  "To Frederick from Nanny G."  

21:53.079 --> 21:55.214
              Oh, look!         

21:55.281 --> 21:57.783
                It's a little   
                Nanny G doll.   

21:57.851 --> 21:59.651
                 (chuckles)     

22:01.087 --> 22:03.322
    Oh, it says "push here."    

22:03.390 --> 22:04.857
                ¶ Here's a silly
                little song ¶   

22:04.924 --> 22:07.026
            ¶ To help you out   
          when things go wrong ¶

22:07.093 --> 22:08.293
        Isn't that cute?        

22:08.361 --> 22:10.429
            ¶ If you get lost   
        and can't find home ¶   

22:10.497 --> 22:13.232
¶ Just remember the number      
        of your phone ¶         

22:13.299 --> 22:17.670
¶ My number is 555-6792 ¶       

22:17.737 --> 22:24.009
    ¶ 555-6792... 555-6792 ¶    

22:24.077 --> 22:26.512
            ¶ That's 555... ¶   
Frasier, this is                
her phone number.               

22:27.781 --> 22:29.815
She's giving you                
her phone number.               

22:29.883 --> 22:30.949
            No, she's not.      

22:31.017 --> 22:32.351
She doesn't want                
you to forget it.               

22:32.419 --> 22:33.986
      She's just using it       
         as an example.         

22:34.054 --> 22:35.854
        ¶ 555... ¶              

22:35.922 --> 22:37.690
     Oh, Lilith, no, don't do...
          (song stops)          

22:37.757 --> 22:40.192
There, gone                     
and forgotten.                  

22:41.561 --> 22:45.197
      NORM, CLIFF & WOODY:      
          ¶ 555-6792 ¶          

22:45.265 --> 22:46.298
          ¶ 555-6... ¶          

22:46.366 --> 22:47.466
                     Whoa!      

22:47.534 --> 22:49.601
             Whoa! Hey!
