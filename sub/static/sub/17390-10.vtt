WEBVTT

00:01.736 --> 00:03.402
Okay, only six more days

00:03.404 --> 00:06.038
till you, me, Andi and Marcy
are on a plane to Vegas.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.473
(laughs)
Oh,

00:07.475 --> 00:09.508
we have been planning this trip
for three years

00:09.510 --> 00:12.578
and something always,
always screws it up.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.079
Well, it was your fault
we cancelled last year.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.382
You had to go out
and get food poisoning.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.085
Yeah, because you cooked me fish
you bought from a guy in a van.

00:20.087 --> 00:23.589
He was wearing a captain's hat.
He seemed legit.

00:23.591 --> 00:27.159
And the year before that,
you had to pet that coyote.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.228
He came right up to me.

00:29.230 --> 00:33.265
Okay, for the next six days,
we play it safe.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.402
No dares, no bets,

00:36.404 --> 00:39.304
no making the crew laugh
with your nail gun tricks.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.107
Nothing is gonna get in the way
of our trip.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.242
All right?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.543
Did you confirm
the hotel reservation?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.744
Yeah, I even talked them into

00:45.746 --> 00:47.312
giving us
the convention discount.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.680
Uh-huh.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.416
Okay, what's the catch?

00:50.418 --> 00:52.051
No catch.
Just, someone's gonna have to

00:52.053 --> 00:53.719
pretend to be a podiatrist.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.155
And, um, possibly give
a quick 90-minute speech.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.593
Hey, Emme,
how was ballet?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.595
Great, I was the cutest one.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.800
She's gonna be trouble,
isn't she?

01:07.802 --> 01:09.134
Yeah, a little bit.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.404
(sing-songy):
Six days to Vegas.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.906
I know, I'm excited.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.407
Oh, but, uh, guess what I heard
at ballet?
Hmm?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.609
Chad Thompson
had a birthday party last week

01:17.611 --> 01:19.144
and Teddy wasn't invited.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.613
What? Wait, which one's
Chad Thompson?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.148
The one that
calls you "toots"?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.783
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.685
He's the one who's got the head
that's too big for his body.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.754
Oh, yeah, yeah,
Bubblehead Thompson, yeah.

01:28.756 --> 01:32.357
Yeah. I just--
I hope Teddy's not upset.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.792
Oh, well, let's find out.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.227
I don't suggest this often,

01:35.229 --> 01:36.495
but let's go
talk to our children.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.767
(door closes)

01:43.170 --> 01:44.236
Okay, you go.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.774
Why don't you go?
You're closer.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.778
Teddy?

01:53.848 --> 01:57.516
Listen, uh,
Mom wants to talk to you.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.822
So, Teddy...

02:05.259 --> 02:07.526
Hey, what's going on with
Chad Thompson these days?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.728
I-I heard he had a
birthday party last week?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.730
I didn't want to go to that.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.465
We don't really hang out
anymore.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.134
Oh, oh.
(chuckles)

02:15.136 --> 02:16.635
Well, so,
who do you hang out with?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.403
The guys who play
<i> Astroline Rebellion,</i>

02:18.405 --> 02:20.506
the greatest computer game
of all time.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.673
Oh. Huh.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.642
So, kids at your
school play that?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.611
No. I've never met them
in person.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.879
They're online friends.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.748
Oh. Wow.
(chuckles)

02:29.750 --> 02:32.551
That is, um...
Troubling?

02:33.888 --> 02:35.287
They're great guys--

02:35.289 --> 02:38.257
SpaceBoss, LonerZero,
TheGoobs43.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.360
The-the goobs?
What-what's a goobs?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.794
Wh-What kind of kids are these?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.163
They're called dorks.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.299
All right, but,
um, sweetie,

02:47.301 --> 02:50.569
you-you hang out with actual
kids at your school, too, right?

02:50.571 --> 02:52.638
Yeah, yeah, kids you definitely
know aren't, like,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.440
grown men in some Internet cafe
in Bangkok.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.812
Not really. I'm more of
an online presence these days.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.681
Oh.
Hmm.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.551
Oh, I should have
taken him fishing more.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.322
Okay, I didn't do it sooner

03:10.324 --> 03:11.423
because I didn't
want to jinx it.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.258
But I booked
our flights to Vegas.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.861
Great news: all
middle seats.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.463
Okay, how come we let
Don plan these trips?

03:18.465 --> 03:20.232
Next year, we got to
make sure

03:20.234 --> 03:22.334
someone's in charge of
making sure he's not in charge.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.337
I don't if now is the right
time to go, you know?

03:25.339 --> 03:28.574
I mean, what, with Teddy
and the space goobers.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.475
What? So he's a nerd.
He's happy.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.379
You're just saying that 'cause
you want to go to Vegas.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.349
Yes. Yes, but also,
he seems fine.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.418
Yeah, the world
needs nerds.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.486
What do you think would have
happened if Bill Gates' parents

03:41.488 --> 03:43.288
had freaked out about
him being a nerd, huh?

03:43.290 --> 03:45.224
There'd be no<i> Angry Birds,</i>
I'll tell you that.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.859
I just don't want the
other kids to think

03:47.861 --> 03:49.294
he's weird and then
give him a hard time.

03:49.296 --> 03:51.430
Growing up is tough.
(chuckles)

03:51.432 --> 03:53.732
You know, I don't have
any personal experience

03:53.734 --> 03:56.001
being an outsider, 'cause I've
always been hot and athletic.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.669
Mm-hmm.
But, um,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.938
I think Don can relate.
Mm.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.474
Yeah. In high school,

04:02.476 --> 04:03.976
Jimmy Dugan used to
follow me around

04:03.978 --> 04:05.410
and call me
a shaved gorilla.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.878
(laughs)
Oh...

04:08.015 --> 04:10.549
Oh, a shaved gorilla.
That's a...

04:12.620 --> 04:14.987
Yeah, well, I was a nerd
growing up and it wasn't easy.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.555
(scoffs) You know,
you're always saying that,

04:16.557 --> 04:17.723
but I am not buying it.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.591
If anything,
you were a hot nerd.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.627
Like, uh, like Velma
on<i> Scooby-Doo.</i>

04:23.631 --> 04:25.030
Ah, you think so, huh?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.465
Oh, yeah.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.699
When you wear
your reading glasses...

04:27.701 --> 04:28.700
(whistles)

04:32.006 --> 04:32.822
All right...

04:32.823 --> 04:33.639
Well, that's because I didn't
go to the same high school

04:33.641 --> 04:35.741
as the three of you.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.342
Okay, I am gonna tell
you guys something

04:37.344 --> 04:39.411
I have never told
anyone before.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.647
My freshman year...

04:41.648 --> 04:42.981
You slept with a teacher?
You got a boob job?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.583
Why is no one else guessing?

04:44.585 --> 04:46.718
Okay, I had just
moved here

04:46.720 --> 04:48.587
from Virginia and I
hadn't made many friends.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.623
I thought, "I'm gonna make a big
splash at the homecoming game."

04:51.625 --> 04:53.058
So, I go to the mall.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.795
And there, in the window,
is a leather suit. Okay?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.498
Just like the one Eddie Murphy
wore in his stand-up special.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.832
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.001
It was shiny, skintight

05:03.003 --> 05:04.703
and bright red.

05:04.705 --> 05:05.671
Oh, no.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.539
Oh, yeah.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.341
And I spent all my
babysitting money on it

05:09.343 --> 05:10.542
'cause I thought...
(scoffs)

05:10.544 --> 05:12.778
"With this suit, I can't lose."

05:12.780 --> 05:15.380
I hope this works
out for her.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.916
You're not good
with tone, are you?

05:17.918 --> 05:18.984
ANDI:
Yeah,

05:18.986 --> 05:20.085
I realized my mistake

05:20.087 --> 05:21.520
as soon as I hit
the bleachers.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.055
You see...

05:23.057 --> 05:24.690
leather makes a sound.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.361
It's a sound that-that
makes people stop

05:29.363 --> 05:31.363
and stare.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.365
Why do I
know this story?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.734
And that's when I
started to sweat. A lot.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.336
And then,

05:37.338 --> 05:38.670
a cheerleader from
the other school

05:38.672 --> 05:40.739
saw me in my
Eddie Murphy suit

05:40.741 --> 05:42.874
and she flipped her little
ponytail at me and she said,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.476
"Oh, hey, look, it's..."

05:44.478 --> 05:45.510
BOTH:
Sweaty Murphy.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.611
What?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.819
But how did you know that?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.020
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.622
You're Sweaty Murphy?

05:57.624 --> 05:59.624
(laughs)

05:59.626 --> 06:01.626
I played in that game.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.928
We talked about you
in the huddle.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.830
We laughed so hard,
they threw a flag.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.032
No, no, no, no,

06:07.034 --> 06:09.568
the only way you would
know that is if...

06:09.570 --> 06:10.902
(swallows hard)

06:10.904 --> 06:12.971
Oh, my God.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.808
You're the girl
with the ponytail.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.943
Oh! (laughs)

06:17.945 --> 06:19.077
And you're the girl
in the suit,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.712
this is so funny!
(laughs)

06:22.649 --> 06:24.816
You don't think
it's funny.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.852
DON: Well,
I'm just glad

06:26.854 --> 06:28.420
you're okay, because
word on the street was

06:28.422 --> 06:29.654
that Sweaty Murphy
went crazy

06:29.656 --> 06:31.456
and ended up in
a home somewhere.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.727
Yeah, my home.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.594
I can't believe
I married Sweaty Murphy!

06:35.596 --> 06:36.928
(laughs)

06:36.930 --> 06:37.929
It's not funny.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.997
It's a little funny.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.399
Funny.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.000
I can't believe we
have been friends

06:42.002 --> 06:44.736
all these years
and that was you.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.872
You are not really mad
about this, are you?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.073
It was years ago.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.976
No, no, I'm not mad.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.612
I mean, I guess I would have
recognized you sooner,

06:53.614 --> 06:56.014
but your hair's too thin
for a ponytail now.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.949
(gasps)

06:57.951 --> 06:59.951
Oh, yeah, I said it.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.525
Don, car.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.527
No, no, no, don't
bother leaving,

07:08.529 --> 07:10.095
I'm going upstairs.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.533
(Adam groans)

07:14.535 --> 07:16.034
Wow.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.569
Yeah. Well, I'm glad

07:17.571 --> 07:20.071
none of that was Marcy's fault.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.507
What are you talking about?

07:22.509 --> 07:25.177
Well, I'm just practicing
for the car ride home.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.212
Ah...

07:27.214 --> 07:29.481
¶ ¶

07:39.693 --> 07:41.893
Oh, boy. How
was your night?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.094
Bad.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.063
Marcy wanted to talk.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.232
I spent years training her
not to depend on me

07:47.234 --> 07:49.768
for emotional support.
That's all out the window!

07:50.771 --> 07:52.204
After you guys left,

07:52.206 --> 07:54.706
Andi went off about Marcy.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.641
She went through
all the English curse words,

07:56.643 --> 07:59.110
then started swearing in
Portuguese like her grandmother.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.681
This Vegas trip
is starting to feel very shaky.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.583
Oh, don't even say that.
I need this trip.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.218
All year, I've been working
in this dump...

08:06.220 --> 08:09.020
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is our business.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.789
I'm sorry,
you know I love this place,

08:10.791 --> 08:12.557
but the thought of Vegas
is the only thing

08:12.559 --> 08:14.259
that gets me through the day
in this hellhole.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.528
Look, I want to go, too.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.896
But I don't think
it's gonna happen,

08:17.898 --> 08:19.898
unless Marcy apologizes.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.033
Well, there's two things
Marcy never does:

08:22.035 --> 08:24.002
one of them,
she did before we got married

08:24.004 --> 08:25.604
and then she stopped.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.075
The one you're talking about,
she's never done.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.677
Well, we got to figure out
a way to talk her into it.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.679
Yeah, I'll be fine.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.915
You know, it's been so long,
I don't even miss it anymore.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.821
Oh, you mean the other thing.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.892
You want me to apologize?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.226
That's a great idea.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.563
Adam, you know I love Andi.

08:51.565 --> 08:55.534
She's one of my best friends,
but she totally overreacted.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.035
All right, between you and me,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.537
I totally agree.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.739
Also between you and me,
I never said that.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.576
She also said
a very hurtful thing to me.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.979
My hair is thick and luxurious,
right, Don?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.749
Like a yak's chest, baby.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.117
Thank you.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.586
Well, look, Marcy,

09:14.588 --> 09:15.987
you are a very powerful woman.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.289
Like a yak!

09:19.259 --> 09:23.295
Okay, uh, Don here
is a shell of a man,

09:23.297 --> 09:24.796
so job well done.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.099
But with that power
comes responsibility.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.870
You have the opportunity now
to be the bigger person.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.205
Hmm. Appealing to my vanity,
I like it.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.142
Okay, I'll do it.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.878
Yes! Great.
This'll mean a lot to Andi.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.246
Oh, and when you do it,

09:41.248 --> 09:42.881
if she starts talking
in Portuguese,

09:42.883 --> 09:45.250
just power through,
that's all compliments.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.753
(door opens)

09:48.755 --> 09:50.589
There she is.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.723
Surprise!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.959
Look who came
to see you.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.128
Hello, Marcy.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.931
That was in English,
that's a good sign.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.334
So, Andi,
I just wanted to say...

10:02.336 --> 10:05.136
Oh, you know what? Nothing you
say can change what happened.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.171
All right?
I mean,

10:06.173 --> 10:07.639
all these years,
I have regretted

10:07.641 --> 10:09.074
not thinking of
the perfect comeback

10:09.076 --> 10:10.642
for when you called me
"Sweaty Murphy"...

10:10.644 --> 10:12.043
(groans)
...but I see now

10:12.045 --> 10:14.179
that I'm not small
and mean like you.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.315
I don't have to blow out
other people's candles

10:17.317 --> 10:18.850
to make mine
shine brighter.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.887
I saw that on a poster
in the dentist's office,

10:22.889 --> 10:24.055
I thought it was
quite something.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.824
Mm-hmm.
You know what?

10:25.826 --> 10:28.660
I cannot believe that you
are still upset about something

10:28.662 --> 10:30.662
that happened when we were kids!

10:30.664 --> 10:31.830
It's kind of crazy.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.232
Who are you calling crazy,
doll hair?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.900
Oh!
Okay, okay, okay,

10:35.902 --> 10:38.203
I think we're moving
in the wrong direction here.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.238
Honey, Marcy came over
to apologize.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.806
No, no,
I am not apologizing anymore.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.975
She's completely overreacting
again.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.378
Overreact-- uh.
A-Are you hearing this?

10:46.380 --> 10:48.313
Do you think I'm overreacting?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.382
Me?

10:50.384 --> 10:52.951
Uh... Do I think
you're overreacting?

10:52.953 --> 10:54.219
She's looking right at you.
Everyone in the room

10:54.221 --> 10:55.654
knows she's talking to you.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.057
Adam?

10:59.059 --> 11:02.360
Well, you are reacting.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.930
And it's definitely not
too little. (chuckles)

11:05.932 --> 11:09.934
It's... Well,
there's underreacting.

11:09.936 --> 11:13.238
Right? Then there's
regular reacting. You know.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.107
Then there's, uh... you.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.275
That means over!

11:17.277 --> 11:19.277
I never said it!

11:19.279 --> 11:20.712
All right.
I gave it a shot, Adam.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.247
I'm out. Don, car.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.315
(Don inhales, exhales)

11:26.787 --> 11:28.753
I never get to stay anywhere.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.759
I can't believe
you didn't back me up.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.828
Come on, Andi.
I always have your back.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.396
I just don't think that
something that happened

11:38.398 --> 11:41.700
in high school should cause
all these problems today.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.735
Because you turned out awesome.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.770
Well, yeah. I am pretty great.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.907
You know, but it was
a long road to get here.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.142
(exhales)
When she said,

11:51.144 --> 11:52.944
"Don, car," I guess she meant,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.746
"Don, I'm taking the car."

11:54.748 --> 11:55.880
Okay, well, good.
I'm glad you're back,

11:55.882 --> 11:57.282
because you can help me.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.917
Okay, don't you think everybody

11:58.919 --> 12:01.720
would be better off
if Andi just let this go?

12:01.722 --> 12:05.724
Be the bigger person,
and just forgive Marcy.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.892
Yeah, I-I mean, I did that
to the guy from high school

12:07.894 --> 12:09.027
who used to call me
a shaved gorilla.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.361
Really?
Yeah.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.030
Wait, you're not just making
this up as you go along?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.298
No.
'Cause I need
something good here.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.767
No. I-It's a nice story,
actually.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.303
Couple years ago,
he came to me looking for a job,

12:18.305 --> 12:20.905
and I took that opportunity
to be the bigger man.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.841
I told him to go to hell.

12:22.843 --> 12:25.376
How does that make
you the bigger man?

12:25.378 --> 12:27.412
Well, he's like five-seven.
I'm way bigger.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.180
I knew it.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.317
All the parts of a good
story, but still useless.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.753
Don, why are you
on his side?

12:34.755 --> 12:37.455
You were a nerd in high school,
too, and he doesn't get it.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.890
I get it.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.458
Oh, really?
Have you ever been so desperate

12:40.460 --> 12:43.061
to get out of a leather suit
that you broke the zipper?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.029
And then your dad
had to cut you out

12:45.031 --> 12:46.531
with an electric carving knife?

12:46.533 --> 12:50.001
Okay. To be fair,
that's a really small club.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.304
You know,
now that I think about it,

12:53.306 --> 12:54.873
Adam sailed through high school.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.908
He was always the winner,
always popular.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.210
Okay. Look, I can't help it
if people are drawn to me.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.280
I'm... magnetic. I don't know.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.948
Life's been easy
for you, hasn't it?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.350
It's... It's been
a good run, yeah.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.219
Well, you remember at dinner,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.421
when I told you they called me
a shaved gorilla?

13:11.358 --> 13:12.390
He laughed.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.392
Oh, no. I do remember that.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.828
It's a funny idea.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.129
I mean, picture a gorilla.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.499
Then, you shave him.
You never see that.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.368
(chuckles)

13:23.370 --> 13:25.537
You know, I think
I'm on Andi's side now.
(groans)

13:25.539 --> 13:26.971
And I don't think
she overreacted at all.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.239
I think you underreacted.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.841
You're an underreactor.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.978
You are on the right
side of history, Don.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.147
What? What is happening here?
Now you got him nuts?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.983
Just because of one day,
like, a million years ago?

13:38.985 --> 13:41.119
Adam, it wasn't
just one day.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.321
I mean, people called me
Sweaty Murphy for months.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.123
All right? Even
my homeroom teacher.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.858
She'd do roll call in the
morning, she'd be, like,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.526
"Murphy," comma, "Sweaty?"

13:48.528 --> 13:51.129
And I'd have to be,
like, "Here."

13:51.131 --> 13:54.165
Oh. Okay. I didn't know
any of that.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.001
I think it's time
you leave, Adam.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.406
It's my house, Don.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.541
Well, it looks like you win
again, doesn't it?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.943
¶ ¶

14:10.016 --> 14:12.283
(door closes, knocks on wall)

14:12.285 --> 14:13.484
Hey, Marcy.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.919
Why are you here?

14:14.921 --> 14:16.588
Apparently, I'm on
your team, now.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.890
Oh, ho, ho. We're gonna be
unstoppable!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.291
What? No... No! It's not good.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
So how do you want to get 'em?

14:21.862 --> 14:23.061
Okay, we're getting them.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.330
Look, Andi is really upset.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.299
(sighs)
And now, she's got Don
all worked up, too.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.568
She even took him to the
school-parent mixer tonight,

14:30.570 --> 14:33.538
instead of me, because
he's on<i> her</i> team.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.975
I had no idea this would be
such a big deal to her.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.443
Okay, look. I don't think either
one of us really understood

14:38.445 --> 14:40.211
her point of view before,
because she's right.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.646
We haven't gone through it.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.581
(sighs)
And I definitely
didn't handle things

14:43.583 --> 14:45.183
the way I should've.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.886
Well, to be honest,
I feel terrible.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.420
I mean, I love Andi.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.523
But I think the reason that I
got so upset was because I...

14:52.525 --> 14:55.627
I wasn't proud of the way
I behaved back then.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.563
I was young and selfish, and
I... I didn't care who I hurt,

14:58.565 --> 15:02.000
so, maybe Andi's right about me.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.468
Wow.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.537
Wow. You just said a lot
of really great things

15:06.539 --> 15:10.108
at a really unhelpful time.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.910
Okay, look. I think
the question is...

15:11.912 --> 15:13.444
How do we get her to forgive us?

15:13.446 --> 15:15.380
How would I know
how to do that?

15:15.382 --> 15:17.248
Okay, Marcy. Look, it's...
everyone in town knows

15:17.250 --> 15:19.150
you hold a hell of a grudge.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.419
Oh, that's nice
that people notice.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.554
Yeah, okay, well. So, if
the roles were reversed,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.423
what would it take
or you to forgive?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.392
Well, talking's not gonna do it.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.193
We need something
to let her know

15:29.195 --> 15:31.296
that we understand
how she feels.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.331
Right? A big gesture.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.433
Would that by any chance
be... a trip to Vegas?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.068
No. No.
Oh.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.037
No. What I would need

15:39.039 --> 15:41.039
is something that would
make me feel better,

15:41.041 --> 15:43.541
while at the same time,
making you feel bad.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.311
You know, preferably, in
a public place with a lot
of people watching.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.079
Okay? And on top of that,

15:48.081 --> 15:51.149
making a profound statement
about the underlying issue

15:51.151 --> 15:52.684
that started the problem.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.419
That's all.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.554
Wow.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.324
My brother Don is a saint.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.560
¶ ¶

16:02.562 --> 16:03.561
So I told Adam,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.196
I'm gonna go to the parent mixer

16:05.198 --> 16:06.698
with someone who's on my team:

16:06.700 --> 16:08.700
Don.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.536
And I misplayed my hand
terribly, so I'm here.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.205
Well, this may come as a shock
to you,

16:14.207 --> 16:16.174
but I was not
the most popular person

16:16.176 --> 16:17.475
in high school either.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.211
Oh, I believe it.
You seem soft, son.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.558
Oh, my God.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.493
Now we got a party.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.764
Why are you dressed like that?

16:39.766 --> 16:43.634
You... sweet, ridiculous man.

16:43.636 --> 16:48.006
I want to be
on Team Sweaty Murphy.

16:48.008 --> 16:51.476
Even though
you have really bad uniforms.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.044
Honey, you didn't
have to do this.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.079
Yes. I did.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.080
And believe me,

16:56.082 --> 16:57.548
now I understand

16:57.550 --> 16:59.350
how you must've felt.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.551
Sweaty...

17:00.553 --> 17:03.054
in every area.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.223
And humiliated.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.457
Hey, Jim.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.660
Oh...

17:09.662 --> 17:13.664
Oh... Now you do get me.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.200
This team sucks.
Take me home.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.603
Ugh.
Look what he wore for me.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.138
Is he not the cutest?

17:20.140 --> 17:23.541
Well, we wanted
to make a point.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.643
We? W-We who?

17:25.645 --> 17:26.744
We...

17:26.746 --> 17:28.413
Marcy?

17:28.415 --> 17:32.216
MARCY: I don't want to
do this anymore, Adam!

17:33.420 --> 17:35.286
Marcy!

17:35.288 --> 17:38.256
(leather creaking)

17:38.258 --> 17:40.792
(laughing):
That's the stuff!

17:40.794 --> 17:42.560
¶ ¶

17:42.562 --> 17:44.295
ADAM:
<i> Okay, I got my keys,</i>

17:44.297 --> 17:46.130
I got the tickets.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.365
Vegas, here we come!
(laughs)

17:47.367 --> 17:48.499
I got to tell you,
I didn't think

17:48.501 --> 17:49.634
this would actually happen.

17:49.635 --> 17:50.768
(chuckles)
Hey, are we still getting

17:50.770 --> 17:52.437
the fake doctor discount?

17:52.438 --> 17:54.105
Yeah. I just got
to write a 90-minute speech

17:54.107 --> 17:56.174
about feet. I got the title.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.843
"Feet: The Hands of Your Legs."

17:58.845 --> 18:00.511
Okay, guys. Come on.
We're gonna drop you at Nana's

18:00.513 --> 18:01.579
on the way to the airport.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.548
All right.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.849
Daddy, my throat hurts.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.318
What? No. No, no, no.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.655
Aw, honey. Come here.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.723
Oh, Adam. She's got a fever.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.725
No! No, no, no.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.862
Yep. Teddy's warm, too.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.332
Every year.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.801
What are we gonna do? Uh...

18:23.803 --> 18:25.670
Don't look at me.
I'm a foot doctor.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.838
¶ ¶

18:33.213 --> 18:34.579
Goobs, watch your tail.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.581
This guy's level 30 xenomorph.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.216
(gasps)
Nice shot, LonerZero!

18:43.323 --> 18:44.522
High five, guys.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.722
Okay, that's it. We're going
fishing next weekend.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.125
And I'm buying you a BB gun.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.861
And this is how you high five.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.262
With another hand.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.331
¶ ¶

18:56.736 --> 18:58.636
Good morning, folks.
(clears throat)

18:58.638 --> 19:01.205
Von Burns, foot doctor.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.507
Foot specialist.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.144
Footballer, if you will.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.513
Let's break down
the word "feet."

19:08.515 --> 19:12.850
From the Latin word "feetatoe."

19:14.420 --> 19:18.422
Ten toes, two feet.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.592
Five toes, one foot.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.628
(Don clears his throat)

19:23.630 --> 19:25.830
I'm gonna let that sink in
for the next...

19:25.832 --> 19:28.566
88 minutes.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.268
In the meantime,

19:30.270 --> 19:32.570
I'm gonna walk with my feet
to the back bar,

19:32.572 --> 19:36.240
get myself
a nice little rum and Coke.

19:36.242 --> 19:38.176
These are my feet, right here,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.244
My feet are walking
toward the bar in the back.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.547
Thank you for coming out.
Enjoy the next 88 minutes.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.948
