pick up the phone. ♪

39:33.425 --> 39:35.158
Yeah.

Okay, maybe it's Danielle.

40:12.932 --> 40:15.265

Yes, Officer.

to grab my clothes

54:39.064 --> 54:41.233

54:45.035 --> 54:46.868
Wait.

54:46.870 --> 54:50.839
If I am, does that mean that
you're going to arrest me

54:50.841 --> 54:52.341
and lock me in a jail cell?

54:52.343 --> 54:54.676
