00:56.098 --> 00:57.132
- I'm tellin' you, man.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.133
The perfect rib
can't just fall off the bone.

00:59.134 --> 01:01.135
It's gotta have
a little chew to it.

01:01.136 --> 01:02.403
- Maybe Sarge will let us
take a poke

01:02.404 --> 01:03.437
at one of them mountain goats.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.606
Have a little Afghan barbecue.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.842
- Can you guys talk about
something other than food?

01:07.843 --> 01:09.809
Hang in there, Nelson.

01:09.810 --> 01:11.445
We get home in a couple weeks,

01:11.446 --> 01:13.781
Amber and I will take you
to the church barbecue.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.649
- Come on, Sarge.

01:15.650 --> 01:17.852
I don't know nothin'
about that church stuff.

01:17.853 --> 01:19.720
- Yeah, well you never had
Pastor Williams' ribs before.

01:19.721 --> 01:22.223
Johnson knows
what I'm talkin' about.

01:22.224 --> 01:23.457

01:23.458 --> 01:28.331

Don't you want to go sing?

02:24.485 --> 02:27.187
- I don't feel like it.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.955
- You know,
singing God's praises

02:28.956 --> 02:30.524
for the gifts
that we've been given,

02:30.525 --> 02:31.959
that's what we do.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.328
- Even when we
don't feel like it?

02:34.329 --> 02:36.699
- Especially when
we don't feel like it.

02:38.699 --> 02:40.336
- I miss Daddy.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.505

02:44.506 --> 02:46.573
But he's gonna be home soon!

- No.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.333
- I regret to inform you...

04:19.334 --> 04:21.035
- No, no!

04:21.036 --> 04:22.970
- That your husband
was killed in combat...

04:25.372 --> 04:28.941
on Thursday, May 20th, 2014.

04:28.942 --> 04:31.889
- No!

04:40.889 --> 04:43.365
No!

06:24.959 --> 06:26.727
- Mom?

06:26.728 --> 06:29.067
It's my turn to bring
the Sunday school snack.

06:39.706 --> 06:42.643
- Announcer: Hey there, folks!
Welcome back to the program.

06:42.644 --> 06:44.811
And, you know, the race world
is still buzzing

06:44.812 --> 06:49.082
about Cody Jackson's
monstrous crash at the DAV 200.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.117
The video's gone viral,
and it's insane out there.

06:51.118 --> 06:53.953
Eddie, what's happened
to Coach Gibbs' golden boy?

06:53.954 --> 06:56.023
- I think, Joe, you'd have
to ask Coach Gibbs that.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.792
I don't know. What I do know is
everyone's coming down on him.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.460
And I don't think it's fair.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.063
I think he's
a tremendous talent.

07:03.064 --> 07:05.799
- They don't try to split
three cars and take the leader

07:05.800 --> 07:08.471
on the high side up
in the marbles on the turn.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.906
- Hand me a 9/16 box end,
would you?

07:44.906 --> 07:47.174
- Heard me comin', right?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.880
- The whole neighborhood did.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.620
You must be Cody.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.153
Joe Cartier.

08:00.154 --> 08:02.088
- That's a nice ride.

08:02.089 --> 08:03.724
- It sure is.

08:03.725 --> 08:06.559
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.261
Word is, you might have
some trouble with that.

08:08.262 --> 08:11.198
- Rubbing is racing, right?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.838
- No, it isn't,
and this isn't a box end.

08:17.839 --> 08:19.739
Grab that box.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.076
We don't want to be late.

08:22.076 --> 08:23.844
- Late for what?

08:23.845 --> 08:25.081
- Church!

08:27.081 --> 08:28.221
- Church?

08:34.221 --> 08:35.922
- Bree, did you get your Bible?

08:35.923 --> 08:37.291
- Yeah, I have it.

08:37.292 --> 08:39.625
- Whoa, there.
- Can I help you?

08:39.626 --> 08:41.695
- Are you Amber Hill?
- Yeah, I'm Amber.

08:41.696 --> 08:42.696
- You've been served.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.834
- Who was that?
- Never mind.

08:47.835 --> 08:48.979
It doesn't matter.
Come on. Let's go.

08:49.003 --> 08:50.704
Let's get in the car.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.278
- There you go.
Good morning.

08:59.279 --> 09:02.222
Good morn... morning.

09:09.222 --> 09:11.062
- Are you gonna
pick me up after church?

09:14.062 --> 09:15.731
- No. You're gonna
stay at Hannah's.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.871
- Okay.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.179
- Bree!

09:32.179 --> 09:33.759
You forgot your treat.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.759
- I wish you would stay.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.062
- I know, but momma's
got to go to work today.

09:50.063 --> 09:51.779
- Okay.

10:04.779 --> 10:06.713
- Hey, Bree!
What'cha got there?

10:06.714 --> 10:08.215
- Who's that?

10:08.216 --> 10:09.422
- She's out of your league.

10:14.422 --> 10:16.822
- Mmm. What'cha got?
- Crazy Krispies.

10:16.823 --> 10:18.959
- Ooh, Crazy Krispies
looks good!

10:20.928 --> 10:22.095
Morning, Joe.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.263
- Hey, Karena.

10:23.264 --> 10:24.931
This is Cody Jackson.

10:24.932 --> 10:26.233
He just volunteered

10:26.234 --> 10:27.933
to head up
our youth outreach program.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.769
- Oh! Well, nice
to meet you, Cody.

10:29.770 --> 10:30.771
- Nice to meet you.

10:30.772 --> 10:32.071
I did what?

10:32.072 --> 10:33.673
♪

10:33.674 --> 10:35.008
- Good morning, Miss Bree.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.442
- Hi, Hannah.

10:36.443 --> 10:37.443
- Is your mom coming?

11:08.109 --> 11:09.776
- So glad you could make it in.

11:09.777 --> 11:10.979
- I am so...
- Save it.

11:11.979 --> 11:14.013
Not interested.

11:14.014 --> 11:15.882
- Hey, did you have a chance

11:15.883 --> 11:18.851
to think
that shift manager position?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.187
- Why don't you try
being on time

11:21.188 --> 11:23.294
for the job you have first?

11:27.294 --> 11:30.830
- I have a question for you.

11:30.831 --> 11:33.000
What happens
when the plans you had

11:34.000 --> 11:37.170
for your life don't pan out?

11:37.171 --> 11:40.172
Some people blame God.

11:40.173 --> 11:43.276
They give up on God.

11:43.277 --> 11:45.144
They stop praying.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.947
They stop reading His word,

11:47.948 --> 11:50.852
stop going to His church.

11:51.852 --> 11:55.024
Do you see all those
empty seats around you?

11:57.024 --> 12:01.427
Those are missing
brothers and sisters.

12:01.428 --> 12:06.398
Love calls us
to bring them home.

12:06.399 --> 12:11.470
They need to know that God
is not done with them,

12:11.471 --> 12:15.274
that He has not abandoned them.

12:15.275 --> 12:20.247
God wants them
to come back to Him.

12:20.248 --> 12:22.548
And, if they are willing

12:22.549 --> 12:28.120
to turn to him with just
the tiniest seed of faith...

12:28.121 --> 12:31.224
he will show them

12:31.225 --> 12:35.228
that nothing is impossible.

12:35.229 --> 12:36.229
- "Truly, I tell to you

12:36.998 --> 12:39.965
"if you have faith
the size of a mustard seed

12:39.966 --> 12:41.835
"you will say this
to the mountain.

12:41.836 --> 12:44.104
"Move from here to there,
and it will move,

12:44.105 --> 12:46.105
"and nothing will be
impossible for you."

12:46.106 --> 12:47.907
- Thank you, David.

12:47.908 --> 12:50.813
Can anyone see what I'm holding?

12:52.813 --> 12:55.415
This is a mustard seed.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.883
It's one of the tiniest seeds
in the world,

12:57.884 --> 13:01.488
but when you plant it a huge,
strong tree can grow from it.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.455
That's a pretty powerful seed,
isn't it?

13:03.456 --> 13:06.292
So what Jesus was saying was

13:06.293 --> 13:08.528
even the tiniest
little bit of faith

13:08.529 --> 13:09.998
can make a difference
in our lives

13:10.998 --> 13:14.234
and in the lives
of our friends and family

13:14.235 --> 13:15.239
because our faith...

13:18.239 --> 13:20.618
can help us lead others to God.

13:30.618 --> 13:32.585
- Well, it's really great
to see you, Monica.

13:32.586 --> 13:33.706
- It's good to see you, too.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.223
- How are things going?
- Great.

13:36.224 --> 13:38.057
Can't complain.
Super busy.

13:38.058 --> 13:41.360
Just landed a huge client,
got promoted to V.P.

13:41.361 --> 13:44.029
- Wow.
That's fantastic.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.167
- Table seven is ready
for coffee refills.

13:47.168 --> 13:49.335
Ten is ready to order,

13:49.336 --> 13:52.174
and your mother-in-law's
at table five.

13:54.174 --> 13:55.977
- Well, good luck
with table five.

13:56.977 --> 13:58.381
- Thanks.

14:01.381 --> 14:05.317
Morning, Patti.
Would you like coffee?

14:05.318 --> 14:07.153
- It's nice to see you, Amber.

14:07.154 --> 14:09.455
Shame I have to come
all the way down here to do it.

14:09.456 --> 14:10.956
- Coffee?

14:10.957 --> 14:12.124
- How's Bree?

14:12.125 --> 14:13.927
- She's good.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.629
What would you like?

14:15.630 --> 14:19.431
- I'd like to spend more time
with my granddaughter.

14:19.432 --> 14:22.369
- And to eat?

14:22.370 --> 14:25.037
- Has she visited
Darren's grave yet?

14:25.038 --> 14:26.198
- If she asks, I'll take her.

14:27.008 --> 14:28.675
- She's eight.

14:28.676 --> 14:31.043
You have to do these things
for her.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.414
You set the tone.

14:34.414 --> 14:36.215
Where is Bree today?

14:36.216 --> 14:37.953
- She's at church.

14:39.953 --> 14:42.955
It just seems to me that Bree

14:42.956 --> 14:45.691
could benefit from
a more consistent home life.

14:45.692 --> 14:47.527
- And that is exactly what
I am giving her.

14:47.528 --> 14:49.061
- By working seven days a week?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.742
- That is something
I have to do right now.

14:50.998 --> 14:52.264
- Why? I'm...

14:52.265 --> 14:53.667
I didn't come here
to pick a fight.

14:53.668 --> 14:56.440
I came to make you an offer.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.608
- With eye shadow and lip gloss?

15:01.609 --> 15:07.180
- Amber, I'd like to help you
set up your own franchise.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.410
- You can make good money
as an independent consultant.

15:11.985 --> 15:16.226
You can quit working here
and be home with Bree.

15:19.226 --> 15:21.961
- I've got this under control.

15:21.962 --> 15:26.099
- We have our differences.
We do.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.399
But I think we can agree

15:27.400 --> 15:29.134
that Bree is
the most important thing

15:29.135 --> 15:30.215
in the world to both of us.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.586
- Tell Bree I said hi.

15:45.586 --> 15:48.388
- Looks like Joe's
youth outreach program

15:48.389 --> 15:50.255
is going to be a big hit.

15:50.256 --> 15:52.392
- What kid wouldn't want to
hang out with a race car driver?

15:52.393 --> 15:53.526
- All right, here we go!
Come on.

15:53.527 --> 15:55.260
Closer, closer.
Don't push.

15:55.261 --> 15:56.730
Step a little closer.
Don't push.

15:56.731 --> 15:58.731
Okay, cowboy.
Help me with this.

15:58.732 --> 16:01.301
One, two, three!

16:01.302 --> 16:03.570
Hoo-ah!

16:03.571 --> 16:05.238
How do ya like that, huh?

16:05.239 --> 16:09.008
Okay, who wants to take
this puppy for a spin?

16:09.009 --> 16:11.076
Oh, everybody.

16:11.077 --> 16:12.579
All right.
Here we go!

16:12.580 --> 16:14.147
That's it. You got it.

16:14.148 --> 16:16.383
Doing great!
That's great! Go for it!

16:16.384 --> 16:19.018
Good job.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.086
Get that curve, now.
To the left, to the right.

16:21.087 --> 16:23.757
That's it! Oh, man.
You are a natural!

16:23.758 --> 16:26.792
Good work, Dean. Nice try.

16:26.793 --> 16:29.796
All right, Codebreaker.

16:29.797 --> 16:32.431
You wanna punch in
and coach up our next driver?

16:32.432 --> 16:34.701
Here we go!
Let's do it!

16:34.702 --> 16:37.704
- Are you gonna help us
build our own go-carts?

16:37.705 --> 16:41.641
Yeah, it looks like it's gonna
be part of my prison sentence.

16:41.642 --> 16:44.643
- Prison? Do you know
David's uncle?

16:44.644 --> 16:45.711
- He's doing a stretch
in Jackson.

16:45.712 --> 16:47.312
We pray for him.

16:47.313 --> 16:50.316
- Do they cost anything?

16:50.317 --> 16:52.484
- Does what cost anything?

16:52.485 --> 16:55.321
- Building the go-carts.
- I don't think so.

16:55.322 --> 16:56.656
It's my first day,
so I'm not really sure.

16:56.657 --> 16:58.258
- Is it a manual or automatic?

16:58.259 --> 17:00.192
- How fast will they go?
- Okay, you know what?

17:00.193 --> 17:01.360
You just sit in the car,

17:01.361 --> 17:02.394
hold your foot to the pedal...

17:02.395 --> 17:04.762
and you steer around the cones.

17:04.763 --> 17:06.569
That's all there is to it.
You got it?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.744
- Got it.

17:18.744 --> 17:19.744
- Amber!

17:21.513 --> 17:23.648
- Hey, Sergeant Price.

17:23.650 --> 17:25.686
Hi.
- How you holding up?

17:26.686 --> 17:28.186
- We're doing okay.

17:28.188 --> 17:30.423
Taking it day by day.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.625
- Let me get this for you.

17:32.626 --> 17:35.594
- Thanks.
I'm just right over here.

17:35.595 --> 17:39.599
- How's Bree?
- She's doing good.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.667
- What grade's she in now?

17:41.668 --> 17:43.403
- She's in fourth.

17:43.404 --> 17:45.705
- Oh. They do grow up fast.

17:45.706 --> 17:47.639
- Yeah, they sure do.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.776
- Listen, we got a lot
of great activities

17:50.777 --> 17:52.579
on the base for kids.

17:52.580 --> 17:55.881
You should bring
Bree around sometime.

17:55.882 --> 17:58.551
- Sure.

17:58.552 --> 18:00.552
Sounds fun.
Thank you.

18:00.553 --> 18:02.754
- You're family, Amber.

18:02.755 --> 18:05.841
We got your back.

18:22.743 --> 18:25.645
- And my friend Allie,
she went really fast,

18:25.646 --> 18:28.915
and David drove
into three cones in a row.

18:28.916 --> 18:30.350
And then when
it was my turn to...

18:30.351 --> 18:32.318
- Whoa, watch it!
Come on, Bree.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.719
Watch what you're doing.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.222
- Sorry, mom.

18:36.223 --> 18:38.925
- What is that, anyway?

18:38.926 --> 18:40.627
- That's my mustard seed.

18:40.628 --> 18:43.263
- Your what?
- My mustard seed.

18:43.264 --> 18:45.764
I planted it in Sunday school.

18:45.765 --> 18:48.400
And Jesus says if you just have
a little faith,

18:48.401 --> 18:50.736
then this tiny seed could grow

18:50.737 --> 18:53.473
into the biggest tree
in the world.

18:53.474 --> 18:56.176
- Hmm.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.311
- And, in science class,

18:58.312 --> 19:01.648
I learned that plants
like to be talked to.

19:01.649 --> 19:02.748
So he needs a name.

19:02.749 --> 19:05.451
- He?
- Yeah.

19:05.452 --> 19:10.395
I can't just call him,
"Hey, seed."

19:18.198 --> 19:19.698
Matthew!

19:19.699 --> 19:22.267
Matt for short.

19:22.268 --> 19:23.903
Where should we keep him?

19:23.904 --> 19:25.638
- I don't know, honey.

19:25.639 --> 19:27.407
Some seeds just don't grow
where we live.

19:27.408 --> 19:30.646
- Mom...
This one will.

20:05.646 --> 20:07.584
- What makes you think
she's out of my league?

20:11.584 --> 20:16.858
- Amber is still recovering
from the loss of her husband.

20:17.858 --> 20:20.264
- How'd he die?
- Afghanistan.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.598
I just don't think you're
what she needs right now.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.534
Anyway, you got other things
to worry about,

20:29.535 --> 20:31.536
like a race to prepare for.

20:31.537 --> 20:33.339
- I really don't know
what Coach Gibbs

20:33.340 --> 20:35.621
is hoping to get from this
little trip back to the minors.

20:37.311 --> 20:40.280
- Yeah. Me either.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.679
If you were my driver,
I would have just fired you.

21:21.988 --> 21:23.523
- So what can I get you tonight?

21:30.097 --> 21:32.400
- I'm sorry. Um...

21:34.400 --> 21:36.802
I'm sorry.
I'll just get...

21:36.803 --> 21:39.805
the meatloaf, um...

21:39.806 --> 21:41.040
fries.

21:41.041 --> 21:43.775
- Fries.
Anything to drink?

21:43.776 --> 21:45.457
- Water's fine. Thank you.

21:58.591 --> 22:00.126
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

22:00.127 --> 22:02.628
I'm good.

22:02.629 --> 22:05.898
I'm good.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.638
Is...

22:12.639 --> 22:14.674
Is Amber working tonight?

22:14.675 --> 22:15.985
- No, I'm sorry.

23:33.587 --> 23:35.925
- Mrs. Hill?

23:37.925 --> 23:41.060
- I can pick up extra shifts
at the diner.

23:41.061 --> 23:44.230
I... I'm really doing
everything that I can.

23:44.231 --> 23:48.167
- Let me explain
what's about to happen.

23:48.168 --> 23:52.772
You've already been served
your second foreclosure notice.

23:52.773 --> 23:57.076
If you miss one more payment,

23:57.077 --> 23:59.579
there are only two options.

23:59.580 --> 24:02.080
You can short sale
your home, and...

24:02.081 --> 24:03.752
- Sell my home?

24:05.752 --> 24:08.186
No, I'm not gonna sell my home.

24:08.187 --> 24:11.627
- Then the bank will be forced
to take possession.

24:13.627 --> 24:16.216
- Thank you very much
for your time.

24:36.216 --> 24:37.216
- Mom?

24:40.087 --> 24:42.088
Mom!
- Hmm?

24:42.089 --> 24:45.860
- Do you have one of
dad's patches?

24:46.860 --> 24:48.727
- Probably.

24:48.728 --> 24:49.896
What for?

24:49.897 --> 24:51.964
- For my go-cart.

24:51.965 --> 24:53.265
- For your what?

24:53.266 --> 24:58.303
- The go-cart club at church.

24:58.304 --> 25:00.540
- Oh, right.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.873
Does that cost any money?

25:01.874 --> 25:03.012
- No.

25:05.012 --> 25:09.282
- Yeah, there should be a patch
in that photo album.

25:09.283 --> 25:10.283
- Okay.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.600
- Hey!
- Hey, Amber.

25:27.601 --> 25:30.570
- Is that...
- Ziti!

25:30.571 --> 25:32.204
- Get in here.
- You know it.

25:35.809 --> 25:37.776
- Bridge, that was so good.

25:37.777 --> 25:39.779
- Plenty for leftovers
this week.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.347
- Yes, it was
absolutely amazing.

25:41.348 --> 25:44.050
Thank you. This is such
a nice surprise.

25:44.051 --> 25:46.151
- Yeah, we need
to do this more often.

25:46.152 --> 25:48.955
- We miss you, Amber.

25:48.956 --> 25:52.190
- Hey kiddo, I think it's time
to get ready for bed.

25:52.191 --> 25:54.827
- Mom, could you sing
to me tonight?

25:54.828 --> 25:56.696
- Not tonight, Bree.

25:56.697 --> 25:59.098
- Please?
Just one song.

25:59.099 --> 26:02.601
- Bed. I'll come tuck you in
in a few minutes, okay?

26:02.602 --> 26:04.704
- You never want to sing for me.

26:04.705 --> 26:09.007
- Bed. Now.
- Okay.

26:09.008 --> 26:10.309
- Goodnight.

26:10.310 --> 26:12.945
- Love you.
Night, sweets.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.013
- Goodnight.

26:15.014 --> 26:18.216
- So when do we get to hear
that beautiful voice again?

26:18.217 --> 26:19.952
- Seriously, the choir
needs your help.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.654
We're a disaster without you.

26:21.655 --> 26:24.825
- I wouldn't even know
where to start.

26:25.825 --> 26:27.262
- Start with a prayer.

26:29.262 --> 26:31.930
- Amber, we know
you're still hurting,

26:31.931 --> 26:33.799
but it's times like these you...

26:33.800 --> 26:35.638
you really need
to lean on your faith.

26:37.638 --> 26:41.040
- I tried putting
my faith in God.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.175
Look where it got me.

26:43.176 --> 26:44.744
- But, Amber,
God's still with you,

26:44.745 --> 26:46.411
blessing you every step
of the way.

26:46.412 --> 26:48.947
- Even when it doesn't
feel like it sometimes.

26:48.948 --> 26:51.951
- You're right.
It doesn't feel like it.

26:51.952 --> 26:54.320
I don't understand why
he would do that to us.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.324
To Bree.

26:58.324 --> 27:01.327
I'm not ready to trust him
with our lives again.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.663
- Amber...
- No, you know what?

27:03.664 --> 27:06.866
I really appreciate all
that you guys have done.

27:06.867 --> 27:09.435
I really do.

27:09.436 --> 27:11.839
But I got this.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.777
If he wants me,
he knows where to find me.

27:35.227 --> 27:37.329
- Good night, kiddo.

27:37.330 --> 27:38.330
I love you.

28:08.261 --> 28:09.701
- Did you think of a name yet?
- Yep!

28:12.064 --> 28:13.498
- Cody!
- Hey, Cody!

28:13.499 --> 28:15.935
Hey!
- The Screaming Eagle.

28:15.936 --> 28:19.938
My dad was the 101st Airborne.

28:19.939 --> 28:21.079
What do you think?

28:26.079 --> 28:28.949
- I think he would love it.

28:29.949 --> 28:31.884
What color do you want
to paint it?

28:31.885 --> 28:35.855
- I like pink, but I like camo.

28:35.856 --> 28:36.856
Pink camo.

28:38.257 --> 28:39.958
- You got it.

28:39.959 --> 28:41.392
- Let's get started!

28:41.393 --> 28:43.532
- There you go! Let's go!

28:45.532 --> 28:48.399
- He was asking about you
again last night.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.236
- Who?
- The wheelchair fella.

28:51.237 --> 28:53.973
Said he needed to talk to you
about something?

28:53.974 --> 28:56.141
But he wouldn't say what it was.

28:56.142 --> 28:58.791
- Thanks, Rosie.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.858
- Grandma!
- Hey!

29:12.859 --> 29:14.827
Oh!

29:14.828 --> 29:17.196
Grandma, Cody and I are
building a go-cart.

29:17.197 --> 29:20.398
- Yeah?
And who's Cody?

29:20.399 --> 29:22.368
- Cody Jackson, ma'am.

29:22.369 --> 29:25.103
Pleasure to meet you.

29:25.104 --> 29:28.206
- Oh. Yeah.
Patti Hill. Nice to meet you.

29:28.207 --> 29:30.009
How long have you
been workin' for Joe?

29:30.010 --> 29:32.544
- Cody is a racecar driver,
grandma.

29:32.545 --> 29:36.815
I guess mom's working
late... again.

29:36.816 --> 29:40.589
- Yeah. She's taking another
shift at Rosie's tonight.

29:42.589 --> 29:45.590
Guess she ran out of options
if she had to call me, huh?

29:45.591 --> 29:48.860
- Rosie's?

29:48.861 --> 29:50.329
Out on Old 37?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.998
- Yeah.
They have great pancakes.

29:52.998 --> 29:54.603
- Go grab your things,
sweetheart.

29:57.603 --> 30:00.973
- Bye, David.
- Bye, Bree.

30:00.974 --> 30:04.313
- Looks like I've got you
all to myself tonight.

30:15.956 --> 30:18.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:18.123 --> 30:19.190
- Can I help you?

30:19.191 --> 30:21.292
- Yeah, um...

30:21.293 --> 30:23.195
I hear you got great pancakes.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.566
- We do.

30:27.566 --> 30:29.467
- I'm Cody.

30:29.468 --> 30:32.370
We saw each other at church.

30:32.371 --> 30:34.305
I know your daughter.

30:34.306 --> 30:37.208
- Oh, that's right.
You're the go-cart builder.

30:37.209 --> 30:40.311
- Actually, I'm...
I'm a race car driver.

30:40.312 --> 30:42.481
I'm just helping Joe
out for a bit.

30:42.482 --> 30:45.451
Well, it's nice to meet you.

30:45.452 --> 30:48.888
Would you like bacon or sausage
with your pancakes?

30:48.889 --> 30:52.491
- Um... bacon.

30:52.492 --> 30:54.659
- Done.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.263
Anything else?

30:57.264 --> 30:59.665
- Yeah.

30:59.666 --> 31:04.270
Look, um, I'm new to town,

31:04.271 --> 31:07.238
and I just thought
it might be nice to...

31:07.239 --> 31:11.409
get to know someone outside
of Joe and a bunch of kids.

31:11.410 --> 31:14.549
- Yeah, that sounds...
That sounds really nice.

31:16.549 --> 31:19.921
But it's just
not a good time for me.

31:21.921 --> 31:23.524
- Okay.

31:24.524 --> 31:26.637
- I'll put this order in
for you.

31:37.637 --> 31:39.405
- Hey, Matt.

31:39.406 --> 31:41.007
Let's see how you're doing.

31:42.007 --> 31:44.609
Oh, you have the perfect amount
of water,

31:44.610 --> 31:46.344
but you feel really cold.

31:46.345 --> 31:48.321
Let me get you a sweater.

31:54.321 --> 31:55.989
That'll warm you up.

31:56.989 --> 31:58.630
Goodnight, Matt.

32:04.630 --> 32:06.732
Hi, God.

32:06.733 --> 32:10.202
Please say hi to my dad
up in heaven...

32:10.203 --> 32:11.736
and make my mom feel better

32:11.737 --> 32:15.607
because I really miss
hearing her sing.

32:15.608 --> 32:18.045
Oh, and please make Matt grow.

32:20.045 --> 32:21.389
Amen.

32:29.389 --> 32:30.469
- Did you brush your teeth?

32:31.992 --> 32:34.592
Good job!

32:34.593 --> 32:38.429
Oh, I love you so much. Oh!

32:38.430 --> 32:40.733
- I love you too so much.

32:40.734 --> 32:45.404
- Good night, peanut.
- Good night.

32:45.405 --> 32:48.255
- Sweet dreams.

33:02.255 --> 33:03.688
- Announcer: Bad credit,
no credit,

33:03.689 --> 33:05.456
apply now, get paid now.

33:05.457 --> 33:07.292

33:30.315 --> 33:31.449
- Hey.

33:31.450 --> 33:33.217
Sorry I'm late.

33:33.218 --> 33:35.053
Clean-up took forever.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.687
How was she?

33:36.688 --> 33:39.291
- Oh, an angel.
- Oh, good.

33:39.292 --> 33:40.359
Thank you again for coming by.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.659
I know it was last minute.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.601
- Oh, anytime.
Who's this Cody?

33:48.601 --> 33:51.536
- I don't know.
We just met.

33:51.537 --> 33:53.237
- Oh.

33:53.238 --> 33:55.577
What happened to
the leather couch?

33:57.577 --> 34:00.712
- You know, it just felt too big
for the two of us, so...

34:00.713 --> 34:02.117
- And the dining room set?

34:04.117 --> 34:06.452
- You know what, Patti?
I'm-I'm really tired.

34:06.453 --> 34:08.487
I've had a long day.

34:08.487 --> 34:11.223
- Oh.

34:11.224 --> 34:13.601
Your daughter needs
more food in this house.

34:31.244 --> 34:32.844
- Not a bad lap.

34:32.844 --> 34:34.612
Okay, setup for turn four.

34:34.612 --> 34:36.882
Now, Cody, I want you to push
the apex of the turn

34:36.882 --> 34:38.817
as late as possible.

34:38.818 --> 34:41.286
Hold the line high,
and delay your entry point.

34:41.286 --> 34:44.223
- Too many words, Joe.
I failed geometry.

34:44.224 --> 34:45.357
- Cody, this is not geometry.

34:45.358 --> 34:47.493
This is the ABC's of racing.

34:47.494 --> 34:48.862
- Very funny.

34:54.867 --> 34:57.536
- Cody, I want you to give me
that sharper turn,

34:57.537 --> 35:00.272
and it will give you more speed
into the straightaway.

35:00.273 --> 35:02.514
- All right. I'll set it up
on the next lap.

35:07.514 --> 35:09.214
- You're coming in too hot.

35:09.215 --> 35:10.248
- What, you want me
to slow down?

35:10.249 --> 35:11.350
- Yes.

35:11.351 --> 35:13.787
But you won't be able to.

35:32.305 --> 35:36.174
Cody, you cannot make
that sharper turn at full speed.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.543
You will spin out every time.

35:38.544 --> 35:39.777
- This is stupid, Joe.

35:39.778 --> 35:42.681
This whole idea
of coming down here.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.449
Going slow is not
going to win me a race.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.756
I'd rather crash than lose.

36:13.512 --> 36:15.214
- Okay, these two check out,

36:15.215 --> 36:16.949
so let's get 'em
in the safe, okay?

36:16.950 --> 36:19.320
- I'll get right on it.
- All right.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.554
Hello, there.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.922
- Hi.

36:23.923 --> 36:26.525
- What can I do for you?

36:26.526 --> 36:28.527
- I need to borrow some money.

36:28.528 --> 36:31.395
- Um, do you have something
to pawn?

36:31.396 --> 36:32.931
- No, I don't.

36:32.932 --> 36:36.500
- No? Well, how much
do you need?

36:36.501 --> 36:39.237
- I need $800.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.575
- All right.

36:43.575 --> 36:45.677
It's 38% interest.

36:45.678 --> 36:47.448
And you pay it in two weeks.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.514
- Yeah.
- Okay?

36:50.515 --> 36:52.687
And I need your signature
right there.

36:55.687 --> 37:01.326
And I'm gonna have to see
a credit card and ID please.

37:01.327 --> 37:04.771
All righty. Perfect.

37:16.376 --> 37:20.015
Will you be able to cover
the next payment in two weeks?

37:22.015 --> 37:23.015
- I can do it.

37:24.983 --> 37:27.853
- I don't know where you
came up with this,

37:27.854 --> 37:32.391
but there are no shortcuts
in your situation.

37:32.392 --> 37:35.594
You need to consider
selling your house.

37:35.595 --> 37:38.063
- That's the only thing
that Darren left me.

37:38.064 --> 37:40.669
I'm not giving up
without a fight.

38:06.626 --> 38:08.793
- We're just about
to wrap things up.

38:08.794 --> 38:09.832
- Yeah.

38:13.865 --> 38:14.866
- I'll go get her.

38:14.867 --> 38:15.867
- Wait. Just a sec.

38:19.004 --> 38:21.105
- Mom! Come see!
Come see!

38:21.106 --> 38:24.643
- Hi, sweetie.
What are you doing?

38:24.644 --> 38:28.112
- Painting the Screaming Eagle.

38:28.113 --> 38:30.848
- Wow.
- All right, kids.

38:30.849 --> 38:32.750
Just a couple more minutes,
then we're gonna clean up.

38:32.751 --> 38:34.786
It's really fantastic, Bree.

38:34.787 --> 38:36.087
- Thanks.

38:36.088 --> 38:38.422
Ooh, I have to lock up
the carts.

38:38.423 --> 38:40.058
- Okay, that's fine.
I can meet you out front.

38:40.059 --> 38:41.994
- Actually, can I
walk home with David?

38:42.994 --> 38:44.997
- Sure. Yeah, that's fine.

38:45.997 --> 38:45.999
I have an errand
I have to run anyway.

38:46.999 --> 38:48.667
Just be home for dinner?

38:48.668 --> 38:50.079
- Okay.

39:01.079 --> 39:04.850
- Hey!
- Hey.

39:04.851 --> 39:07.719
- So... what do you think?

39:07.720 --> 39:09.721
- I'm super-impressed.

39:09.722 --> 39:13.058
I have not seen her that happy
in a really long time.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.560
- Well, she's a great kid.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.066
- Yeah.
She really is.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.833
- There's a...

39:22.834 --> 39:25.871
There's a great band playing
at Harry's tomorrow night.

39:25.872 --> 39:27.742
You wanna go check 'em out?

39:29.742 --> 39:31.509
- Yes.

39:31.510 --> 39:33.677
Yes, I would like that.

39:33.678 --> 39:34.712
- Okay, great.

39:34.713 --> 39:36.014
- Okay.

39:36.015 --> 39:39.150
I'll pick you up at 8:00?

39:39.151 --> 39:40.151
- Yeah.
That sounds great.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.990
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.692
I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

39:47.693 --> 39:49.470
- Okay.

39:57.470 --> 40:00.806
- Okay. Now this is
a very big step for her.

40:00.807 --> 40:03.842
So if anything happens,
you call me first, okay?

40:03.843 --> 40:05.052
- Got it.

40:19.057 --> 40:21.726
- We're gonna need
a little help.

40:21.727 --> 40:23.497
- Bridgette!?

40:25.497 --> 40:26.999
- Okay, okay.
Okay, got it.

40:27.999 --> 40:30.668
Got it, got it, got it.
Coming! Coming!

40:31.704 --> 40:33.904
- I was literally two seconds

40:33.905 --> 40:35.139
from calling this off.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.842
Thank you.

40:36.843 --> 40:38.009
- It's what I'm here for.

40:38.010 --> 40:40.045
You did the same for me,
remember?

40:40.046 --> 40:42.781
- You're right. I did.
Winter formal.

40:42.782 --> 40:44.148
- Oh my gosh.
Those highlights you gave me?

40:44.149 --> 40:46.717
Come on. Come on. Just...

40:46.718 --> 40:48.719
- You went full-on orange.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.688
- Oh my gosh. But my hair was
the least of my worries.

40:50.689 --> 40:53.123
Remember my date?
- Oh my...

40:53.124 --> 40:54.692
Matt Smootech!

40:54.693 --> 40:56.161
No, no, let's not talk about it.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.929
Let's, let's not talk about it.

40:58.930 --> 41:01.035
- Oh...

41:03.035 --> 41:05.771
I'm just not sure I should
be doing this.

41:06.771 --> 41:11.610
- It's just coffee. Okay?

41:11.611 --> 41:14.946
- I know, but it just somehow
feels like I'm being disloyal.

41:14.947 --> 41:17.681
- Amber, look at me.

41:17.682 --> 41:19.284
I know this is
a big step for you.

41:19.285 --> 41:21.752
I know.

41:21.753 --> 41:24.788
It's okay.

41:24.789 --> 41:26.662
It's just coffee.

41:32.965 --> 41:34.903
- Hi, Cody.
- Hey, there.

41:36.903 --> 41:39.904
- Mom! Cody's here!

41:39.905 --> 41:41.672
You could come in.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.930
- Thank you!

42:04.930 --> 42:06.300
- Hi.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.300
- Hi.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.905
You look incredible.

42:13.905 --> 42:15.816
- Thanks.

42:23.816 --> 42:25.176
- He must have been
an amazing man.

42:27.986 --> 42:29.628
- Yeah, he was.

42:35.628 --> 42:37.332
- Can I ask you
what happened to him?

42:40.332 --> 42:43.805
- He died while he was
on patrol with his team.

42:45.805 --> 42:48.148
I haven't really asked
beyond that.

42:57.148 --> 42:58.720
Should we go?

43:00.720 --> 43:02.754
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:02.755 --> 43:03.755
- Yeah, let's go.

43:06.024 --> 43:09.027
- I told mom Matt would grow.

43:09.028 --> 43:10.895
- You'll have to show her
when she gets home.

43:10.896 --> 43:12.931
This is really beautiful, Bree.

43:12.932 --> 43:14.398
You should bring him in

43:14.399 --> 43:15.933
and show them to the other kids
at Sunday school.

43:15.934 --> 43:18.802
- I will.
One second.

43:18.803 --> 43:21.276
- What are you doing?

43:24.276 --> 43:26.944
- Matt loves his music.

43:29.347 --> 43:31.248
- Come on.
Let's go watch a movie.

43:31.249 --> 43:33.250

to win the race.

44:02.148 --> 44:03.348
- So how do you go from that

44:03.349 --> 44:06.887
to building go-carts for church?

44:08.887 --> 44:10.990
- Well...

44:11.990 --> 44:14.426
That was the last race

44:14.427 --> 44:17.194
that I actually crossed
the finish line.

44:17.195 --> 44:20.033
- Oh.
- Yeah.

44:22.033 --> 44:25.203
I'm having trouble in the turns.

44:25.204 --> 44:31.875
So Coach Gibbs sent me here
to hang out with Joe.

some sort of...

- Yeah.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.719
Yeah, Joe's a great guy.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.789
So how's it going?

44:44.789 --> 44:47.958
- So far I've spent more time
building go-carts

44:47.959 --> 44:48.994
than I have turning laps.

44:49.994 --> 44:53.931
- That's
an interesting approach.

44:53.932 --> 44:55.232
Is it helping?

44:55.233 --> 44:57.268
- We'll find out next week.

44:57.269 --> 44:59.471
- What's next week?

44:59.472 --> 45:01.910

Oh yeah, I'm really scared.

51:02.401 --> 51:04.704
- Oh, you should be.

51:06.704 --> 51:09.739
- Are you ready, ready?

51:09.740 --> 51:11.512
- Oh, I'm ready, ready.

51:13.512 --> 51:15.582
- Ready.

51:16.582 --> 51:18.354
- Set.

51:22.354 --> 51:24.762
- Go!

51:30.762 --> 51:33.197
- I'm trying to punch it hard
into the turn because...

51:33.198 --> 51:36.868
- Cody, everybody knows
how fast you can go.

51:36.869 --> 51:40.837
What you need to work on
is knowing when to go fast

51:40.838 --> 51:43.878
and learning when to go slow.

51:45.878 --> 51:48.881
- Going slow has
never won me anything.

51:49.881 --> 51:51.616
- Oh, really?

51:51.617 --> 51:53.284
- Hey!

51:53.285 --> 51:54.719
- Hey.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.554
- Oh, wow.
Boys and their toys.

51:56.555 --> 51:58.255
Yeah.

51:58.256 --> 52:00.857
- I brought lunch.
- Oh. Well. That's my cue.

52:00.858 --> 52:03.694
- Oh, no, no. Please. Join us.
I brought so much.

52:03.695 --> 52:05.696
Somebody called in a big order
and didn't pick it up.

52:05.697 --> 52:07.797
So, please.
There's lots of food.

52:07.798 --> 52:11.536
- Well, I'm sure you got
things to do, right?

52:11.537 --> 52:13.673
- No. I can eat.

52:16.841 --> 52:19.777
Hooah...

52:19.778 --> 52:21.511
Mmm.

52:21.512 --> 52:23.582
- Don't choke on that.

52:24.582 --> 52:26.951
- Rosie's burgers are the best.

52:26.952 --> 52:29.487
- Why don't you
go over there, then?

52:32.256 --> 52:35.359
I'm sorry. Is this what
you guys do all day?

52:35.360 --> 52:37.363
- Normally, we use
full-sized cars.

52:39.363 --> 52:41.264
- Is he any good?

52:41.265 --> 52:45.368
- Well, Coach Gibbs
seemed to think he is,

52:45.369 --> 52:47.471
or he wouldn't have
sent him to me.

52:47.472 --> 52:50.574
We got a race this weekend.

52:50.575 --> 52:53.643
It would be an honor
if you and Bree

52:53.644 --> 52:55.249
would come as our guest.

52:57.249 --> 52:58.449
- I don't know.

52:58.450 --> 53:00.686
Maybe.

53:01.686 --> 53:04.522
- Hey, you ever driven
a race car before?

53:04.523 --> 53:06.963
- No.

53:17.568 --> 53:18.573
- ♪ Hey ♪

53:22.773 --> 53:24.308
- You're still on the clutch.

53:24.309 --> 53:26.310
- Oh my god.
- More gas.

53:26.311 --> 53:27.545
- I've never driven
a stick before.

53:27.546 --> 53:29.279
- Shift out of first
into second.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.714
- I can't tell.
Is that in gear?

53:30.715 --> 53:32.350
Oh, okay. Okay.
I got this!

53:32.351 --> 53:34.252
I got this.
- Yeah, you got it all right.

53:34.253 --> 53:35.853
Come on with it.
Give it a little more gas.

53:35.854 --> 53:36.894
Give it a little more gas.

53:36.988 --> 53:38.556
- It's all about confidence.

53:38.557 --> 53:40.391
- More gas, baby.
More gas.

53:40.392 --> 53:42.360
- A little more clutch.
- Which is the gas?

53:42.361 --> 53:43.860
Wait, the gas is like...

53:43.861 --> 53:45.429
- All right, ease up
on the clutch.

53:45.430 --> 53:47.598
Ease up.
- Okay, okay.

53:47.599 --> 53:48.866
Okay. Give it the gas.

53:48.867 --> 53:50.701
- You're doin' great.

53:50.702 --> 53:52.036
- Take it slow.
Take her slow.

53:52.037 --> 53:54.404
Take her slow.
- You got it! Nice.

54:00.778 --> 54:01.811
- Foot off the gas!

54:01.812 --> 54:03.447
Whoo!

54:04.515 --> 54:05.949
- You guys okay in there?

54:05.950 --> 54:07.051
You all right?

54:07.052 --> 54:09.953
- You okay?

54:09.954 --> 54:12.624
- That was great, guys.

54:15.593 --> 54:19.830
That was awesome.

54:19.831 --> 54:22.070
- Cody, you're gonna need
some new tires.

54:30.408 --> 54:32.743
- What's wrong?

54:32.744 --> 54:34.744
- I just miss my dad so much.

54:34.745 --> 54:38.382
And my mom, she...

54:38.383 --> 54:41.791
- Have you tried talking
to her about it?

54:45.791 --> 54:47.590
- No.

54:47.591 --> 54:51.929
Well, when I try,
it's like she's not even there.

54:51.930 --> 54:55.398
She doesn't even hear me.

54:55.399 --> 54:59.036
- Well, try to find a way
to make her listen.

54:59.037 --> 55:01.038
I think that's what your dad
would want you to do.

55:01.039 --> 55:02.605
- David!

55:02.606 --> 55:04.875
How's your little baby go-cart

55:04.876 --> 55:06.009
for Sunday school?

55:06.010 --> 55:07.877
- Stop it!
It's not funny!

55:07.878 --> 55:09.913
You're just jealous!

55:09.914 --> 55:12.583
- It's okay, Bree.
- No, it's not!

55:12.584 --> 55:16.386
- Sure it is!
- Leave him alone!

55:16.387 --> 55:17.654
- Make me!

55:17.655 --> 55:19.858
- Oh, Bree!

55:20.858 --> 55:23.094
Wow!

55:23.095 --> 55:25.096
So fast.
- Pretty cool, huh?

55:25.097 --> 55:27.434
- Yeah.

55:30.434 --> 55:31.434
Hello?

55:34.004 --> 55:36.507
Fighting, Bree?
Really?

55:36.508 --> 55:38.641
- But he was making fun
of David.

55:38.642 --> 55:41.545
- I'm sorry. That is not
a reason to attack someone.

55:41.546 --> 55:46.049
Honestly, what has gotten
into you, Breeanne Hill?

55:46.050 --> 55:50.888
- Dad used to say some things
were worth fighting for.

55:50.889 --> 55:53.930
- What was that?

55:59.930 --> 56:03.604
- Can I stay at grandma's house
while you work?

56:06.604 --> 56:08.605
- No, I'm-I'm sorry.

56:08.606 --> 56:10.755
You have to come
to the diner with me tonight.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.623
- Voicemail:
First unheard message.

56:25.624 --> 56:27.590
- Amber, this is Sergeant Price.

56:27.591 --> 56:29.460
I wanted to follow up with you

56:29.461 --> 56:32.029
about some programs we have
available through the 101st.

56:32.030 --> 56:34.098
Please give me a call...
- Next message.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.500
- Mrs. Hill, This is
Jim Wellington from the bank.

56:37.501 --> 56:41.705
I'm afraid your loan was
sold to a third party.

56:41.706 --> 56:43.072
They are requiring

56:43.073 --> 56:44.641
full payment immediately,

56:44.642 --> 56:46.576
or your house goes up
for auction.

56:46.577 --> 56:47.657
It's urgent that we speak.

56:47.979 --> 56:49.947
- So can we go to Cody's race?

56:49.948 --> 56:52.917
- Please, give me a call.

56:52.918 --> 56:53.954
- Mom.

57:01.492 --> 57:03.012
- I'm sorry, sweetie.
What did you say?

57:04.128 --> 57:06.099
- Can we go home now?

57:17.575 --> 57:20.210
- You haven't paid
your first loan off yet.

57:20.211 --> 57:23.514
We're gonna have to see
some kind of collateral.

57:35.861 --> 57:37.198
- Okay.

57:41.198 --> 57:44.268
Eh, it's only
a third of a karat.

57:44.269 --> 57:46.738
But flawless.

57:47.738 --> 57:49.607
Who dumped who?

57:49.608 --> 57:50.977
- Excuse me?

57:51.977 --> 57:53.277
- Well, the way I see it

57:53.278 --> 57:55.645
is that he cared enough
about you to pick

57:55.646 --> 57:57.681
the best diamond
he could afford.

57:57.682 --> 58:01.552
Not some low-quality large stone
to try and impress you.

58:01.553 --> 58:04.087
- What's it worth?

58:04.088 --> 58:08.928
- He ain't gonna come in here
looking for this ring, is he?

58:09.928 --> 58:15.266
I mean, I don't get involved
with messy break-ups.

58:15.267 --> 58:17.034
- He was killed in Afghanistan,

58:17.035 --> 58:18.802
so I think the chances of him
coming in here

58:18.803 --> 58:20.243
looking for that ring
are pretty low.

58:24.209 --> 58:25.648
- Okay.

59:28.974 --> 59:30.843
- Grandma's here!

59:33.845 --> 59:37.047
Grandma!
- Bree!

59:37.048 --> 59:40.150
Oh. How are you?

59:40.151 --> 59:42.786
- Patti.
What brings you by?

59:42.787 --> 59:45.788
- Oh, I just saw you were in.

59:45.789 --> 59:48.229
- I'll go add a bowl
for grandma!

59:52.229 --> 59:53.549
- Are you losing the house,
Amber?

59:53.999 --> 59:57.201
- Not if I can help it.

59:57.202 --> 01:00:00.142
I do have an appointment
to discuss it tomorrow.

01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:05.074
- No grandchild of mine is going
to be out on the streets.

01:00:05.075 --> 01:00:07.377
Why don't I take Bree
with me for a while,

01:00:07.378 --> 01:00:09.649
so that you can
straighten things out here?

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:13.789
Where's Darren's ring?

01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:19.857
Did you take it off for Cody?

01:00:19.858 --> 01:00:22.326
- No. Patti, please.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:25.728
This has nothing to do
with Cody.

01:00:25.729 --> 01:00:27.697
And it's none of your business.

01:00:27.698 --> 01:00:29.065
- Oh, you better believe
it's my business.

01:00:29.066 --> 01:00:30.805
That was my mother's ring.

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:36.376
You sold it?

01:00:38.376 --> 01:00:40.076
You actually sold it.

01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:41.879
- I had to, Patti.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.050
I've lost everything.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.155
- Not everything.

01:00:50.155 --> 01:00:52.693
Bree, sweetheart.
I can't stay.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.765
Sorry, peanut.

01:01:01.765 --> 01:01:03.218
- What did you say to her?

01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:23.386
Mom, can you help me?

01:01:23.387 --> 01:01:25.422
- Bree, no. I can't
help you right now.

01:01:25.423 --> 01:01:27.023
Just do the ones that you know,

01:01:27.024 --> 01:01:28.584
and we'll do the rest
when you get home.

01:01:28.992 --> 01:01:32.362
- Can I get
another chocolate milk?

01:01:32.363 --> 01:01:34.331
- Chocolate milk is not free,

01:01:34.332 --> 01:01:35.766
and table 8's waiting for you.

01:01:35.767 --> 01:01:37.167
- Okay, thank you.

01:01:37.168 --> 01:01:38.835
When I have my break,

01:01:38.836 --> 01:01:40.203
I'll get you a little something
to eat and...

01:01:40.204 --> 01:01:41.204
Oh my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

01:01:42.006 --> 01:01:43.126
Thank you.
- It's no problem.

01:01:44.008 --> 01:01:47.277
I'm Mike.
Mike Nelson.

01:01:47.278 --> 01:01:49.179
- I know.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.049
- Hey, I was wondering
if we could...

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.453
- Hey, do you...
You want anything to eat?

01:01:56.454 --> 01:01:58.489
- Well, actually, is there
some place we could,

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:00.123
we could talk or...?

01:02:00.124 --> 01:02:01.924
- You know, I'm in the middle
of working,

01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:03.793
and it's just not a good time.

01:02:03.794 --> 01:02:06.263
- Hey, you go to our church,
right?

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.334
- That's right.

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:12.235
- That's my dad's patch.

01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:13.237
You're a Screaming Eagle, too?

01:02:13.238 --> 01:02:14.238
- Yes I am.

01:02:15.006 --> 01:02:18.308
I'm Mike.
- I'm Bree.

01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:19.909
Pleased to meet you.
- Right.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.390
- Amber, table's waiting!
- Thank you.

01:02:21.979 --> 01:02:24.281
Bree, please sit down.
- Hey, listen.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:26.016
Bree, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

01:02:26.017 --> 01:02:27.851
Amber, I hope we see
each other soon.

01:02:27.852 --> 01:02:30.823
Maybe at church. All right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:33.489
- Is she eating?

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:34.857
- Come on, Rosie.

01:02:34.858 --> 01:02:36.125
I'm running out of options here.

01:02:36.126 --> 01:02:38.494
- Not my problem.

01:02:38.495 --> 01:02:40.931
Paying customers only.

01:02:40.932 --> 01:02:42.431
- All right.

01:02:42.432 --> 01:02:44.134
Then we'll take
two cheeseburgers,

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:47.273
two fries
and two chocolate shakes.

01:02:49.273 --> 01:02:52.375
- Coming right up.
Thank you.

01:02:52.376 --> 01:02:54.011
- Joe thought I should
check on you

01:02:54.012 --> 01:02:56.045
after your quick exit
from the track.

01:02:56.046 --> 01:02:58.815
- Yeah.
It's a long story.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:00.023
She can fill you in.

01:03:05.023 --> 01:03:07.056
- Yeah, I got in a fight.

01:03:07.057 --> 01:03:08.826
- Did you start it?

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.963
- No, not really.

01:03:11.963 --> 01:03:13.901
- Well, did you win?

- Cody Jackson's monstrous crash
at the DAV 200.

01:03:49.066 --> 01:03:50.601
The video's gone viral.

01:03:50.602 --> 01:03:52.969
What's happened
to Coach Gibbs...

01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:54.170
- Hey, Cody.

01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:57.107
- Hey, Cofflin.
How you doin'?

01:03:57.108 --> 01:04:00.009
- Good. I didn't expect
to see you here in Berlin.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.379
- Yeah, I didn't plan
to be here.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:05.248
You saw the crash?
- I did.

01:04:05.249 --> 01:04:07.653
Try and keep it
off the wall tonight.

01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:11.188
- You got it.
- Good luck, man.

01:04:11.189 --> 01:04:12.189
- Good luck.
- Cody!

01:04:15.026 --> 01:04:17.594
- Bree!

01:04:17.595 --> 01:04:20.364
You made it!
Thank you.

01:04:20.365 --> 01:04:22.299
- So I've been
doing some research,

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.600
and I have some advice for you.

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:25.201
- Shoot.

01:04:25.202 --> 01:04:28.272
- Drive really fast,
and turn left.

01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:31.141
- All set, Speed Racer?

01:04:31.142 --> 01:04:34.076
- You bet.
- All right.

01:04:34.077 --> 01:04:35.511
Let's watch
from the top of the trailer.

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:36.947
Best seats in the house.

01:04:36.948 --> 01:04:38.147
- Sounds good, Joe.

01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:39.184
Come on.

01:04:41.184 --> 01:04:42.252
Good luck.

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:43.425
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:56.967
- And welcome to race night
here at Berlin.

01:04:56.968 --> 01:04:59.302
We have a heck of a main event
for you here this evening.

01:04:59.303 --> 01:05:00.938
- That's right, John.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.659
Cody Jackson makes
his return to the track

01:05:03.006 --> 01:05:07.411
after his spectacular crash
at the DAV 200 just weeks ago.

01:05:07.412 --> 01:05:09.679
- Spectacular, indeed.
In fact, horrifying.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.148
Many people thought
his career was over.

01:05:13.718 --> 01:05:16.057
And we're underway.

01:05:19.057 --> 01:05:22.092
- What about you, partner?
You see that new paint job?

01:05:22.093 --> 01:05:24.661
- Sure did.
It looks great.

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:27.140
- Well let's try to keep
some of it on the car.

01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:39.543
- Cody, watch number 15.

01:05:39.544 --> 01:05:41.344
He's getting a little loose
out there.

01:05:41.345 --> 01:05:42.625
- Yeah, I got him.
- Yeah, Cody!

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.748
- Cody!

01:05:44.749 --> 01:05:47.217
- Cody, you've been coming
into the turns a little hot.

01:05:47.218 --> 01:05:49.185
Don't get too aggressive
here at the end.

01:05:49.186 --> 01:05:53.589
- There's no trophy
for 4th place, Joe.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.594
- Cody, back it off
on the turns.

01:05:57.595 --> 01:05:59.395
You can't keep making
moves like that.

01:05:59.396 --> 01:06:01.374
- Settle down.
I know what I'm doing.

01:06:09.374 --> 01:06:11.208
- If Jackson can keep this pace,

01:06:11.209 --> 01:06:14.381
he might just challenge Cofflin
for the checkered flag.

01:06:16.381 --> 01:06:19.181
- Stay focused.
Wait for your opportunity.

01:06:19.182 --> 01:06:22.752
Use that sharper turn into
the curve to set up your line.

01:06:22.753 --> 01:06:25.258
- I'm not gonna back off
now, Joe. Not now.

01:06:27.258 --> 01:06:28.759
- Great. Get your
tools ready, guys.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.271
- It's go time.

01:06:40.271 --> 01:06:43.139
- Announcer: Cofflin and Jackson
neck and neck,

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.407
and he is thinking about...

01:06:44.408 --> 01:06:46.710
Oh, no!
He's losing it!

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:48.645
- My god.
- He's in trouble, folks!

01:06:51.282 --> 01:06:54.284
- Cofflin goes
under the checkered flag

01:06:54.285 --> 01:06:57.721
in first place, followed by...
then Crump,

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.589
but everybody's eyes
are on the in-field,

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.292
and I hope that Jackson
is all right.

01:07:02.293 --> 01:07:04.261
- Cody!
- Bree!

01:07:04.262 --> 01:07:07.230
- Bree! No! No!

01:07:07.231 --> 01:07:09.132
You stay here with your mom.
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:09.133 --> 01:07:10.137
He'll be okay.

01:07:13.137 --> 01:07:15.205
Get him out guys.
Get him out!

01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.845
- Cody!

01:07:53.845 --> 01:07:56.645
- Bree, I'm all right.

01:07:56.646 --> 01:07:58.184
I'm all right, Bree.

01:08:00.184 --> 01:08:01.894
I'm okay.

01:08:10.894 --> 01:08:12.728
- Come on, Bree.
We're going home.

01:08:12.729 --> 01:08:16.700
- Mom!
What are you doing?

01:08:16.701 --> 01:08:19.933
- Bree. Come on.
- Mom.

01:08:48.933 --> 01:08:52.571
- I had a clear line.

01:08:54.571 --> 01:08:57.616
- Guys, give us a minute,
will ya?

01:09:05.616 --> 01:09:07.386
You see that scrap heap?

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:10.719
That's what's gonna
become of your life

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.953
if you don't learn to...

01:09:11.955 --> 01:09:15.292
- Listen, and slow down
on the turn.

01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:16.892
I know.

01:09:16.893 --> 01:09:18.761
- Oh you know,
but you don't get it.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:20.362
This isn't about the turn.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:23.700
Did you see
the look on Amber's face?

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:25.602
Racing is dangerous enough

01:09:25.603 --> 01:09:28.604
without you adding recklessness
to the mix.

01:09:28.606 --> 01:09:32.209
If you care for them, show it.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.944
They've lost enough already.

01:09:34.946 --> 01:09:37.587
You got that?

01:09:57.668 --> 01:09:59.428
- Come on, Bree!
We can't be late for school!

01:10:00.004 --> 01:10:01.905
- I couldn't find my helmet.

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:03.572
- That's okay.
You can leave your helmet.

01:10:03.573 --> 01:10:04.874
We're not going
to go-cart club anymore.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.776
- Why not?
- 'Cause I said so.

01:10:06.777 --> 01:10:08.945
- But my cart's almost done,
and I really want...

01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:11.914
- No more racing.
- What?!

01:10:11.915 --> 01:10:14.750
Mom!
- Don't argue with me. Leave it.

01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:16.686
- No!
- Now we're gonna be late!

01:10:16.687 --> 01:10:17.687
Get in the car.

01:10:43.313 --> 01:10:45.714
- What is that sign for?

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.521
- Miss? Miss?
Can I help you?

01:10:51.522 --> 01:10:54.758
- Why was there an auction sign
in my front lawn this morning?

01:10:54.759 --> 01:10:55.879
- Mrs. Hill, I'm sorry. I...

01:10:57.428 --> 01:10:58.828
- It's not the full amount,

01:10:58.829 --> 01:11:00.629
but it's everything
that I've got.

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.731
- Amber.
- Pay the lender.

01:11:02.732 --> 01:11:05.172
Stop the foreclosure, please.
I have fought too hard for this.

01:11:06.003 --> 01:11:08.677
- This is no way for you
and your daughter to live.

01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:45.842
- You ready, kiddo?

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.944
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:47.945 --> 01:11:49.381
- Is Matt ready?

01:11:51.381 --> 01:11:53.016
- I think so.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.722
Do you think the new house
will be better for him?

01:11:57.722 --> 01:11:58.722
- We'll see.

01:12:05.129 --> 01:12:06.948
Shall we?

01:12:33.991 --> 01:12:37.794
- I know it's a bit of
an adjustment Amber, but...

01:12:37.795 --> 01:12:39.695
- Yeah, with a little
elbow grease,

01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:42.097
it'll feel like home
before dinner.

01:12:42.098 --> 01:12:46.468
- Can I go inside, now?
- Yeah. Go inside.

01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:48.170
- This could be a good home.

01:12:48.171 --> 01:12:50.406
I mean, maybe not what
you were expecting, but...

01:12:50.407 --> 01:12:52.875
- I just wish
that I could see it.

01:12:52.876 --> 01:12:55.747
- Well, you have to have
a little faith to see it.

01:12:57.747 --> 01:13:00.016
- It's still there, Amber.

01:13:00.017 --> 01:13:03.455
Buried but fighting.

01:13:05.455 --> 01:13:08.090
Kinda like that little sprout
in Bree's pot.

01:13:08.091 --> 01:13:10.692
- That plant's not
gonna grow, Bridge.

01:13:10.693 --> 01:13:12.829
- Well, give it
some time, Amber.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.164
I mean, whether you
believe it or not,

01:13:15.165 --> 01:13:16.645
God's got you
in the palm of his hand.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.604
- We got you, too.

01:13:21.604 --> 01:13:23.106
- Thanks, girls.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:25.648
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:33.660
♪

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.927
- I'm trying to help them,
Darren.

01:13:43.928 --> 01:13:46.599
I just...

01:13:52.635 --> 01:13:55.838
I don't know what to do.

01:13:55.839 --> 01:13:58.736
I miss you so much.

01:14:25.736 --> 01:14:27.236
- Dear heavenly Father Lord,

01:14:27.237 --> 01:14:29.873
we come to you now to pray
for our friend, Amber.

01:14:29.874 --> 01:14:32.808
We know that where two or more
are gathered you are here,

01:14:32.809 --> 01:14:35.078
and we know that
you are here with us.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:37.746
Please reveal yourself
to her, Lord.

01:14:37.747 --> 01:14:40.048
Shine your grace down upon her.

01:14:40.049 --> 01:14:41.918
Soften her heart.

01:14:41.919 --> 01:14:44.286
Please help grow
that seed of faith

01:14:44.287 --> 01:14:47.111
that we know is still there
in her heart, Lord.

01:15:47.785 --> 01:15:49.619
- Boogedy boogedy.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.853
Make it happen at
Joe's Auto Repair!

01:15:51.854 --> 01:15:54.123
That's my girl!
Come on, to the inside.

01:15:54.124 --> 01:15:55.844
To the inside.
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

01:15:55.992 --> 01:15:58.160
David, come on!
Take the inside line.

01:15:58.161 --> 01:16:00.963
Just take the inside line.
Hold him off, Bree.

01:16:00.964 --> 01:16:03.165
Come on, David.
- Yeah, yeah! That's it!

01:16:03.166 --> 01:16:05.334
Way to go, Bree!
There you go.

01:16:05.335 --> 01:16:07.337
Lead that turn, David!

01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:12.174
- All right, guys.
- Five laps to go.

01:16:12.175 --> 01:16:14.843
- Whoo!

01:16:14.844 --> 01:16:17.614
All right!

01:16:18.848 --> 01:16:20.219
Bree, what's wrong?

01:16:22.219 --> 01:16:23.919
Hey, I've been trying
to call you.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.188
- Let's go. I told you you
are done with this.

01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:28.657
- I don't want to go!
This is not fair.

01:16:28.658 --> 01:16:30.830
- Get in the van.
- Amber. Wait a minute.

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:35.231
Amber!
What's going on?

01:16:35.232 --> 01:16:38.368
- This doesn't concern you.

01:16:56.053 --> 01:16:58.954
- You never let me do anything!
- That's not true!

01:16:58.955 --> 01:17:00.356
- Then how come the
only time I have fun

01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:02.191
is when you're not around?

01:17:02.192 --> 01:17:04.393
- You know what, Bree?
I'm doing the best I can.

01:17:04.394 --> 01:17:07.864
I really am.
- Dad would want me to do this.

01:17:07.865 --> 01:17:08.931
- Yeah, well he's gone,
all right?

01:17:08.932 --> 01:17:10.298
You're stuck with me!

01:17:10.299 --> 01:17:12.435
- I hate you!

01:17:12.436 --> 01:17:15.142
I wish you died instead of dad!

01:17:45.268 --> 01:17:46.268
Bree?

01:17:53.143 --> 01:17:56.111
Bree?

01:17:56.112 --> 01:17:58.112
Bree, open the door, please.
I want to talk to you.

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:14.772
Bree.

01:18:21.772 --> 01:18:23.308
Bree!

01:18:25.308 --> 01:18:27.479
Bree!

01:18:29.479 --> 01:18:30.482
Bree!

01:18:32.482 --> 01:18:34.192
Bree!

01:18:46.028 --> 01:18:48.063
- Bree!
- Bree!

01:18:48.064 --> 01:18:50.266
- Bree, make a noise if you can,
sweetheart!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.134
- Breeanne Hill!

01:18:52.135 --> 01:18:54.102
- Bree, honey!
It's okay.

01:18:54.103 --> 01:18:56.371
Please come out.
Please?

01:18:56.372 --> 01:18:57.976
Please, baby.
I'm not mad at you!

01:18:58.976 --> 01:19:01.244
I just want you to come out.
Please!

01:19:01.245 --> 01:19:03.346
- Bree!
- What have I done, Bridge?

01:19:03.347 --> 01:19:05.114
- Bree! Bree!

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:07.517
- Listen, Ams...
- Bree!

01:19:07.518 --> 01:19:10.085
When we're
in our most hopeless moments...

01:19:10.086 --> 01:19:12.420
the Lord is closest to us.

01:19:12.421 --> 01:19:15.293
He hears you, okay?

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.361
- Where are you, Bree?

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.199
- Okay, everyone.
We're gonna canvas this area.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.400
Stay close together.

01:19:24.401 --> 01:19:26.004
Call in if you find anything.

01:19:27.004 --> 01:19:29.271
Karena and I will be here
working the phones.

01:19:29.272 --> 01:19:31.173
- Pray as you search, people.

01:19:31.174 --> 01:19:35.244
- Work in pairs.
Check in every 30 minutes.

01:19:35.245 --> 01:19:36.915
We will find her.

01:19:38.915 --> 01:19:40.415
- Cody.

01:19:40.416 --> 01:19:42.457
You'll do her more good
searching for Bree.

01:19:48.457 --> 01:19:51.526
- Hey, can I go with you, Cody?

01:19:51.527 --> 01:19:54.096
- Yeah, of course.

01:19:54.097 --> 01:19:56.566
- Yeah. Why don't y'all take
the alley south to 7th Street.

01:19:56.567 --> 01:19:58.433
Let's go.
- Bree, come out, honey!

01:19:58.434 --> 01:20:00.335
- We're gonna find that
little stinker, okay?

01:20:00.336 --> 01:20:02.905
- Bree!
- Heavenly Father...

01:20:02.906 --> 01:20:05.210
- It's pretty hard to find her
if you're not out looking!

01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:08.544
Why is it

01:20:08.545 --> 01:20:10.111
that I have
to find out from Facebook

01:20:10.112 --> 01:20:11.847
that my own granddaughter
is missing?!

01:20:11.848 --> 01:20:13.081
- Patti, I can't do this
right now.

01:20:13.082 --> 01:20:16.084
- Oh, I...
- Patti, Patti.

01:20:16.085 --> 01:20:18.553
- I have all of my associates
and every customer

01:20:18.554 --> 01:20:20.121
for three counties ready to go.

01:20:20.122 --> 01:20:21.960
Where haven't we looked?

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.863
- Bree?

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:29.134
Bree, come on, sweetie.
Where are you?

01:20:32.134 --> 01:20:34.939
Let's go, guys.
Look everywhere.

01:20:36.939 --> 01:20:38.173
We gotta move it.

01:20:38.174 --> 01:20:40.276
Bree!

01:20:43.313 --> 01:20:45.647
- I heard you were
in Darren's unit.

01:20:45.648 --> 01:20:49.384
- Yeah. He saved my life.

01:20:49.385 --> 01:20:51.654
- Does Amber know that?

01:20:51.655 --> 01:20:53.259
- I don't think so.

01:20:55.259 --> 01:20:56.259
- Maybe she should.

01:21:00.196 --> 01:21:03.499
- Unit 65 to Central Dispatch,
making a stop. Copy.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.216
- Copy that, Unit 65.

01:21:20.216 --> 01:21:24.286
- License and registration,
please.

01:21:24.287 --> 01:21:26.362
- How fast was I going?

01:21:32.362 --> 01:21:33.564
- Bree!

01:21:35.564 --> 01:21:37.232
Bree!

01:21:37.233 --> 01:21:40.468
Honey, we've been
looking for you all night!

01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:42.338
- Hi, yeah, yeah, Karena,
she's here.

01:21:42.339 --> 01:21:45.473
I just got here.
Yes, thank you! Thank you!

01:21:45.474 --> 01:21:47.343
- Oh!
- Bree!

01:21:47.344 --> 01:21:49.678
Oh, sweetie.

01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:51.446
- You all set, Miss Patti?

01:21:51.447 --> 01:21:52.949
- Thank you Brice.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.250
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

01:21:55.251 --> 01:21:57.018
Bree, your cart
will be at Joe's.

01:21:57.019 --> 01:21:59.521
- Thanks, Officer Brice.
- You're welcome.

01:21:59.522 --> 01:22:02.090
You all have a good night.
- Goodnight.

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.526
- Sweetie, you can't ever
do that to me

01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:05.628
ever, ever again, okay?

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.495
You had me worried sick.

01:22:07.496 --> 01:22:08.664
Now come on.
We've had a long night.

01:22:08.665 --> 01:22:11.001
Let's get you home.
- No.

01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:15.204
- What?
- I wanna stay here.

01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:17.472
- Sweetie, we're not gonna stay
at grandma's tonight.

01:22:17.473 --> 01:22:20.414
- But I wanna live with her.

01:22:24.414 --> 01:22:26.315
- You what?

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:28.551
- You know, we're all
exhausted here.

01:22:28.552 --> 01:22:30.619
Maybe it's okay for the night.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:33.489
- Patti, my daughter's gonna
stay with me tonight.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.731
- No, I'm not.

01:22:40.731 --> 01:22:42.168
- Bree, go on up.

01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:46.768
- How dare you!

01:22:46.769 --> 01:22:49.605
- I think it's best if everyone
has a little space.

01:22:49.606 --> 01:22:52.240
- Bree! Bree, I'm not gonna
force you, but...

01:22:57.046 --> 01:23:00.016
- Amber, she came to me.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.284
- Patti, please!

01:23:02.285 --> 01:23:04.320
- Go home.

01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:06.131
We all need to get some rest.

01:23:41.258 --> 01:23:44.692
- First you take Darren!
Then you take my home!

01:23:44.693 --> 01:23:47.829
And now you turned
my daughter against me!

01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:50.365
Please.

01:23:50.366 --> 01:23:53.640
I believed in your goodness!

01:24:01.277 --> 01:24:03.545
We gave you everything.

01:24:03.546 --> 01:24:07.383
Our love, our devotion.

01:24:07.384 --> 01:24:09.584
Why?

01:24:09.585 --> 01:24:12.554
Why would you take my husband?

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:18.731
Why would you leave my daughter
without her father?

01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.736
Where's my reward
for my faith, God?!

01:24:26.736 --> 01:24:29.142
What are you gonna do to fix it?

01:24:32.142 --> 01:24:33.508
Please.

01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:36.579
Please Lord.
I can't do this.

01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:39.781
I can't do this.

01:24:39.782 --> 01:24:41.655
I need you.

01:24:45.655 --> 01:24:47.798
Where are you?

01:25:28.798 --> 01:25:30.201
- She's just hurting.

01:25:32.201 --> 01:25:34.451
We'll figure this out, Amber.

01:25:48.451 --> 01:25:49.817
- Amber.

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:58.466
- Mike has something
he's been wanting to tell you.

01:26:04.466 --> 01:26:08.500
- We'll be right outside
if you need us.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.803
- Sergeant Hill, he was...

01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:43.378
He was the closest thing
I ever had to a father.

01:26:48.378 --> 01:26:50.380
We were on patrol.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.465
- Lock and load.

01:27:09.465 --> 01:27:11.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop! Stop!

01:27:20.309 --> 01:27:23.745
- There's nothing good
for us here, Sarge.

01:27:23.746 --> 01:27:25.513
- Let's not borrow trouble.

01:27:25.514 --> 01:27:28.683
Eyes and ears, boys.
Full security.

01:27:28.684 --> 01:27:29.684
You know the drill.

01:28:01.884 --> 01:28:02.884
- RPG!

01:28:08.357 --> 01:28:13.361
- Ah!

01:28:16.031 --> 01:28:19.767
- Allahu akbar!

01:28:19.768 --> 01:28:23.006
- Fire!
- Cover the ridge!

01:28:24.006 --> 01:28:25.473
Nelson!

01:28:25.474 --> 01:28:29.445
- Get those doors open!

01:28:33.817 --> 01:28:36.821
- Cease fire, now!

01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:40.054
Ah!

01:28:40.055 --> 01:28:42.057
- Nelson!
- I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:28:42.058 --> 01:28:44.459
- I got you, kid!
- Ah!

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:45.794
- Get him outta there!

01:28:50.366 --> 01:28:52.868
- Ooh! Come on.

01:28:59.476 --> 01:29:00.515
- Here!

01:29:06.515 --> 01:29:07.950
- You stay with me, kid.

01:29:08.985 --> 01:29:10.919
Sarge!

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.457
Sarge!

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:22.764
- Sarge.

01:29:22.765 --> 01:29:25.769
You saved me.

01:29:26.769 --> 01:29:28.606
You saved me.

01:29:39.448 --> 01:29:42.017
You're loved...

01:29:42.018 --> 01:29:44.628
more than you
could ever imagine.

01:29:57.866 --> 01:29:59.503
- Sarge?

01:30:00.503 --> 01:30:01.550
Sarge?

01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:15.550
I am sorry...

01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:21.789
he chose to save me...

01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:25.694
rather than come home to you...

01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:28.196
and your daughter.

01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:33.572
- His faith gave him
the courage to...

01:30:36.572 --> 01:30:37.572
to do the impossible.

01:30:56.226 --> 01:30:59.695
- He made this...

01:30:59.696 --> 01:31:02.934
from the shrapnel
of our first firefight.

01:31:05.934 --> 01:31:07.143
It belongs to you.

01:31:15.143 --> 01:31:18.716
See, he saved more...

01:31:20.716 --> 01:31:22.575
than just my life.

01:33:04.187 --> 01:33:05.223
- Can we talk?

01:33:07.223 --> 01:33:09.357
- Sure.

01:33:09.358 --> 01:33:10.358
Come on.

01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:19.070
- And it hit me that Darren
was your loss, too.

01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:24.239
I mean, I lost my husband,
but you lost your son.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.978
And I'm so sorry.

01:33:29.978 --> 01:33:32.313
- Thank you for saying that.

01:33:32.314 --> 01:33:35.350
- I mean, I'm not gonna pretend

01:33:35.351 --> 01:33:37.987
that we don't have our issues,
but I'm...

01:33:38.987 --> 01:33:42.893
I'm willing to make
an honest effort if you are.

01:33:44.893 --> 01:33:47.714
- Darren loved you very much.

01:34:04.714 --> 01:34:07.315
This is a family heirloom.

01:34:07.316 --> 01:34:10.252
Let's...

01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:12.920
Let's try to protect it...

01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:15.956
so it's here for Bree
when she needs it.

01:34:15.957 --> 01:34:17.031
Okay?

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.402
- Thank you.

01:34:26.402 --> 01:34:28.807
Hey.

01:34:30.807 --> 01:34:33.309
Bree, I owe you an apology.

01:34:34.309 --> 01:34:35.978
- You do?

01:34:36.978 --> 01:34:38.950
- I do.

01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:44.953
And there's something
that I want us to do together.

01:35:06.174 --> 01:35:08.313
- Bree, sweetie.

01:35:10.313 --> 01:35:14.449
We have one more letter
to read from your daddy.

01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:16.918
It came a couple days
after the soldiers came

01:35:16.919 --> 01:35:20.021
to tell me that
he had passed away.

01:35:20.022 --> 01:35:22.324
I just couldn't open it.
- It's okay, mommy.

01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:24.793
We can open it together.

01:35:24.794 --> 01:35:26.478
- Okay.

01:35:42.478 --> 01:35:46.084
- "Dear Amber... and Bree...

01:35:48.084 --> 01:35:50.218
"This will be the last letter

01:35:50.219 --> 01:35:52.853
"you get before I come home.

01:35:52.854 --> 01:35:56.228
"So I guess I'd better
make it a good one.

01:35:59.228 --> 01:36:01.295
"If I've learned anything
in the last 14 months apart,

01:36:01.296 --> 01:36:03.164
"it's this.

01:36:03.165 --> 01:36:06.935
"When you choose Him,
he takes care of your fears.

01:36:06.936 --> 01:36:13.909
"It can be hard to do that
every day, especially here,

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:16.311
"but I try because
this road leads to Him

01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:17.579
"and back to you.

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:21.816
"See you soon.

01:36:21.817 --> 01:36:24.022
"I love you
with all of my heart, Darren."

01:36:35.397 --> 01:36:38.866
I've just been hurting so bad.

01:36:38.867 --> 01:36:41.436
I lost sight
of the most important blessing

01:36:41.437 --> 01:36:43.405
he ever gave me.

01:36:43.406 --> 01:36:45.008
- The house?
- No, sweetie.

01:36:46.008 --> 01:36:47.008
You.

01:36:49.978 --> 01:36:51.913
Thank you.

01:36:51.914 --> 01:36:54.850
- I'm sorry that
I said that I hate you.

01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:58.102
- That's okay sweetie.
I know you didn't mean it.

01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:20.941
Lord, please give us the courage
to put our love into action,

01:37:20.942 --> 01:37:22.509
just like Darren did.

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:25.591
Thank you for leading me
back to my family.

01:37:36.591 --> 01:37:38.627
- I thought I was gonna
teach you guys

01:37:38.628 --> 01:37:40.495
about racing
when I first got here.

01:37:40.496 --> 01:37:45.333
But it turns out I actually
learned more from you.

01:37:45.334 --> 01:37:47.004
For the longest time,
I thought...

01:37:48.004 --> 01:37:50.672
I thought racing was
only about going fast.

01:37:50.673 --> 01:37:55.276
But racing, like life, is about
knowing when to go fast

01:37:55.277 --> 01:37:56.378
and knowing when to take
your foot

01:37:56.379 --> 01:37:59.647
off the pedal and have faith.

01:37:59.648 --> 01:38:02.383
Because, if we go too fast,

01:38:02.384 --> 01:38:03.951
we might not notice
the blessings

01:38:03.952 --> 01:38:05.352
that are right there
in front of us.

01:38:07.255 --> 01:38:10.691
All right? So let's,
let's bring it in, okay?

01:38:10.692 --> 01:38:12.192
Okay, drivers.

01:38:12.193 --> 01:38:14.596
Start your engines!

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:16.233
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:38:18.233 --> 01:38:20.168
- Boom!
- Good luck!

01:38:20.169 --> 01:38:24.105
- Sounds like you might
be ready to make that turn.

01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:27.942
- ♪ Little hands,
shoeless feet ♪

01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:31.379

- Yes!

01:38:48.731 --> 01:38:50.464
- All right, Bree!

01:38:50.465 --> 01:38:55.337
Give 'em a run for their money.

01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:06.983
- There you go,
there you go! Oh!

01:39:14.389 --> 01:39:15.389
