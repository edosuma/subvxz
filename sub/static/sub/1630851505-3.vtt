WEBVTT

00:05.138 --> 00:08.174
Previously on CSI: Vegas...

00:05.138 --> 00:08.174
GRISSOM:
Hodges worked every one

00:08.241 --> 00:10.076
of the cases you saw
in that storage unit.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.311
Everything in there

00:11.378 --> 00:13.213
felt so staged.

00:13.279 --> 00:14.748
GRISSOM:
Science'll tell us
if how things look

00:14.814 --> 00:16.049
is how they really are.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.183
Hodges didn't do this.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.385
GRISSOM:
Does the evidence

00:18.451 --> 00:20.153
get a say in this?

00:18.451 --> 00:20.153
BRASS: You think

00:20.220 --> 00:21.321
someone stole your stuff

00:21.388 --> 00:22.489
and is using it to frame you?

00:22.555 --> 00:24.057
That's exactly what I think.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.692
SIDLE: Our life's work is
on the line.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.594
What kind of person kills a dog?

00:27.660 --> 00:29.629
The kind that wants
to break into a house

00:29.696 --> 00:31.598
without drawing attention.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.598
BRASS: What do we do now?

00:31.664 --> 00:34.067
Follow the evidence.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.067
ROBY: Dr. Grissom,

00:34.134 --> 00:36.069
I could persuade you
to come back to CSI?

01:12.205 --> 01:14.307
(panting)

01:42.502 --> 01:44.537
(indistinct chatter)

01:53.847 --> 01:56.249
Mr. Folsom, Ms. Rajan,
all yours.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.418
Hey, uh, have I got
these on backwards?

01:58.485 --> 02:00.587
I wouldn't tell you
if they were.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.555
Is this your first
floater, Allie?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.123
You can take it.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.492
WOMAN:
Sandra's my boss.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.760
We were meeting
for a run here, and I...

02:07.827 --> 02:09.429
Oh, God.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.499
Ms. Li, the two men you saw--
could you describe them?

02:12.565 --> 02:15.435
I'm sorry, Detective.
I didn't see their faces.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.437
The second guy--
the one in the hoodie--

02:17.504 --> 02:19.172
he was wet.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.207
I think he was in
the water with Sandra.

02:21.274 --> 02:25.411
Running shoes,
yoga pants, head band.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.813
Seems to confirm
her friend's story.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.248
They were going
for a run.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.450
No wallet or ID.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.352
You thinking
mugging gone wrong?

02:32.418 --> 02:34.554
(scoffs)
I was. I'm not now.

02:34.621 --> 02:37.423
That's one pricey right hand.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.427
There's no wounds
on her legs or back.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.196
Help me flip her?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.200
Oh. (gasps)

02:48.902 --> 02:51.337
This woman was butchered.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.959
You're up early.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.328
First-day jitters?

03:16.529 --> 03:17.597
Yeah.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.916
Max.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.916
Undersheriff.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.918
Someone I'd like
you to meet.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.421
Dr. Roby. Nora Cross.
A pleasure.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.421
Ah.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.623
Nora is with
Internal Affairs.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.958
Ah.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.893
(clears throat)
I love this.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.728
You were a point guard, right?

03:48.795 --> 03:50.530
First player off the bench
your sophomore year.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.998
Were you at Northwestern, too?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.300
No, just been reading up on you.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.235
Not what you really want
to hear from an IAB detective.

03:56.302 --> 03:57.870
Just doing due
diligence on this lab.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.707
The sheriff made me lead on
the David Hodges investigation.

04:01.941 --> 04:03.610
I see you've been
reading up, too.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.979
You don't miss much, do you?

04:06.045 --> 04:07.313
The judge is
gonna slate

04:07.380 --> 04:09.716
the David Hodges
trial quick.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.285
I thought I'd make
the introduction

04:12.352 --> 04:13.953
so you two could get
a schedule figured out.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.289
Our lab, our specialists
are at your disposal.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.957
That's appreciated,

04:18.024 --> 04:20.026
but I still haven't decided
whether I'm gonna be

04:20.093 --> 04:22.328
running my investigation
out of Vegas or Washoe County.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.365
Hold on.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.501
(laughing): There's no need
to wave the white flag here.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.570
Don't cut us out
of the investigation.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.805
Big fat public rebuke is the
last thing this lab needs.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.940
CROSS:
We can't have

04:34.007 --> 04:35.742
even the appearance
of a cover-up.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.543
I'm gonna interview a
few folks around here.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.978
I'll let you know
what I decide.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.780
Thanks for having me.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.886
GRISSOM:
I miss old Hank.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.055
Best dog I ever had.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.055
Me too.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.524
Looks like Brewski
was also a good dog.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.292
(barking, growling)

04:51.591 --> 04:53.292
He took a nice bite
out of whoever

04:53.359 --> 04:55.395
broke into Hodges' garage.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.497
I'll give him
the Canine Medal of Honor

04:57.563 --> 04:59.532
if the blood on this tooth

04:59.599 --> 05:01.300
tells us who framed Hodges.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.339
ROBY:
Hope y'all are hustling.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.942
A judge just set a trial
date for David Hodges.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.344
Fast track.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.612
You're kidding.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.612
Mm-mmm.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.881
Also, Internal
Affairs-- they might

05:14.947 --> 05:17.050
take their ball
and run to Washoe.

05:17.116 --> 05:20.520
Washoe County's seven hours
from Vegas. I prefer

05:20.586 --> 05:22.689
my evidence under a microscope,
not on the back of a truck.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.057
I couldn't agree
more, so if

05:24.123 --> 05:25.858
you happen
to see an IAB detective

05:25.925 --> 05:28.327
by the name of Nora Cross,
just head the other way.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.329
Good. So now we get
to play hide-and-seek?

05:30.396 --> 05:31.964
Well, this isn't gonna help.
There's not enough

05:32.031 --> 05:34.400
DNA left on the dog's tooth
to run through CODIS.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.669
There's only
2,000 base pairs here.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.638
ROBY:
2,000's usually

05:38.705 --> 05:40.106
not enough to make an ID,

05:40.173 --> 05:42.408
but...

05:40.173 --> 05:42.408
SIDLE: You can make

05:42.475 --> 05:45.678
a prediction about phenotype
from a sample this small?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.046
You're in my kitchen now.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.648
Let's go deeper
in the DNA.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.516
You're looking for

05:50.583 --> 05:52.752
a male suspect,
and the telomere suggests

05:52.819 --> 05:54.454
that he is not

05:54.520 --> 05:55.988
a spring chicken.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.658
Don't look at me.
I didn't do it.

05:58.725 --> 05:59.859
(laughs)

05:59.926 --> 06:00.893
SIDLE:
Our man

06:00.960 --> 06:02.028
looks to be

06:02.095 --> 06:04.063
of South American descent.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.365
You're off the hook.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.502
MALE REPORTER: A fatal stabbing
on Ogden Avenue

06:09.569 --> 06:11.070
is under investigation
this morning.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.506
Pioneering video
game designer Sandra King

06:13.573 --> 06:15.141
was found dead.
She was 34...

06:15.208 --> 06:16.909
If you ask me,
it's all been downhill

06:16.976 --> 06:19.112
since Super Mario Brothers Two.

06:19.178 --> 06:22.615
Our vic's kind of a big deal.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.886
Okay, we have 13 stab wounds.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.489
12 in her chest, and

06:29.555 --> 06:32.058
one... in her throat.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.827
Got to think two or three
would've gotten the job done.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.596
Your guy thrust so hard,

06:36.662 --> 06:39.565
some of the wounds almost
go right through her.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.601
So, from the angles
on your diagram,

06:41.667 --> 06:43.836
the blades would
have hit her ribs.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.571
But I don't see any tool marks.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.673
Because there aren't any.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.109
So, what are you saying--

06:50.176 --> 06:53.045
the knives weren't
made of metal?

06:50.176 --> 06:53.045
Exactly.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.048
(grunting)

06:54.113 --> 06:56.048
RAMIREZ: Whatever
did this-- it was

06:56.115 --> 06:58.184
a material softer than bone.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.886
Such as?

06:59.952 --> 07:01.921
Who knows? I could make
you a razor-sharp blade

07:01.988 --> 07:03.823
out of a cardboard box.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.823
Hmm.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.659
I do have
a birthday coming up.

07:06.726 --> 07:10.663
Sandra King wasn't the
only one to get sliced up.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.665
She scratched one
of her attackers.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.535
As a matter of fact...
If you don't mind.

07:12.732 --> 07:15.535
Mm.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.070
I thought you'd never ask.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.074
Likely your suspect's
been marked.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.010
Mm-hmm.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.113
Oh, there's also this.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.483
No clue what caused it.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.618
Necklace got yanked?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.618
Maybe.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.888
Glad they left the
rest of her jewelry.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.058
Fitness tracker'll tell us
a lot about her final hour.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.092
Hugo,

07:40.159 --> 07:41.761
turn that up.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.761
Yeah.

07:42.595 --> 07:45.665
WYATT: I've just met
with Dr. Maxine Roby.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.133
So, to the cowards

07:47.200 --> 07:49.936
who murdered Sandra King,
hear this.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.205
Justice is coming.
It will be swift.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.973
FEMALE REPORTER:
What do you have to say
to anyone disaffected

07:54.040 --> 07:56.008
by the David Hodges scandal?

07:56.075 --> 07:59.011
WYATT:
I say pay close attention
as to how this case is handled.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.748
The Las Vegas Crime Lab

08:47.727 --> 08:49.195
You thought your son
would be fighting monsters

08:49.262 --> 08:51.664
in outer space?

08:49.262 --> 08:51.664
No. Like, designing
games like these.

08:51.731 --> 08:55.534
Uh-huh.

08:51.731 --> 08:55.534
Like Sandra King, right?

08:55.601 --> 08:57.169
I mean, he was, like,
really into it.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.272
He-he would, like, draw
his own characters,

08:59.338 --> 09:01.674
and their castles, and...

09:01.741 --> 09:03.276
He'll figure it out.

09:03.342 --> 09:06.746
Hmm. My boy's
getting a C-minus

09:06.812 --> 09:08.881
in pottery.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.918
Yeah, I know.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.918
Got the Wi-Fi password--
"WhosYourDaddy69."

09:11.984 --> 09:13.920
(chuckles) And to think

09:13.986 --> 09:16.055
the gaming industry used
to have a problem with sexism.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.291
Sandra King's fitness tracker
says her heart rate

09:18.357 --> 09:20.893
shot up like crazy
in the green room upstairs

09:20.960 --> 09:22.929
four hours before
she was attacked.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.698
So if you're crime scene
investigators,

09:25.765 --> 09:26.799
why aren't you
at the crime scene?

09:26.866 --> 09:28.267
We got
evidence saying

09:28.334 --> 09:30.903
that something happened
to your boss in this room

09:30.970 --> 09:32.271
around 5:00 p.m.
yesterday.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.006
Who was in the green room then?

09:34.073 --> 09:35.574
Uh, well, we were
pretty scattered,

09:35.641 --> 09:36.842
getting the tournament
stack set up.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.978
Our boss might
have heard-- Ben--

09:39.045 --> 09:39.912
but he's with Sandra's
parents now.

09:39.979 --> 09:40.913
ROBY: Does anyone else

09:40.980 --> 09:42.281
have access to this room?

09:42.348 --> 09:43.950
Dozens of people
from the company,

09:44.016 --> 09:46.218
but we all loved her.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.218
She was like

09:46.285 --> 09:47.753
everyone's
older sister.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.789
Sandra gave me my first job.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.692
They were still working out
of Ben's garage back then.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.962
Today was supposed
to be, like, a... a triumph.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.964
Death Spiral just
hit four million downloads.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.099
LI: I will say,

10:00.166 --> 10:02.234
a female creator
with that kind of success--

10:02.301 --> 10:04.937
there are definitely
some haters.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.372
I can imagine.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.773
FOLSOM: What was your favorite
video game growing up?

10:07.840 --> 10:09.942
Uh... solitaire.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.678
What? I liked to read.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.714
That's no excuse.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.717
Tight end, shortstop
and Zelda.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.862
Hey, that abrasion
below her hairline?

10:31.731 --> 10:34.700
Rip that off my neck,
my heart rate's spiking.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.636
Somebody was raging.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.271
Let's find out who.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.710
ROBY: Got your print here.

10:44.777 --> 10:47.179
This is so stupid.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.748
No, I could never kill anyone.

10:48.814 --> 10:49.982
Is that why you
go by the name

10:50.049 --> 10:52.718
Count Von BodyCount?

10:52.785 --> 10:53.753
(chuckling): Oh, come on.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.254
It's a screen name.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.923
That's my brand.
I'm a pro.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.925
I'm third all-time
in Death Spiral cash games.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.927
Let's just say

11:01.994 --> 11:03.996
that it pays the bills.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.996
Maybe it used to.

11:04.063 --> 11:07.967
Yo, my DMs are full
of people asking how I feel

11:08.034 --> 11:10.970
about Sandra King patching
the weapon upgrade glitch.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.806
Answer: not surprised.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.307
Leave it to some bitch coder

11:15.374 --> 11:17.910
to fix a bug
that made her game better.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.145
Wh...

11:21.881 --> 11:24.717
Wasn't just one whiny rant,

11:24.784 --> 11:27.186
Mr. BodyCount.
There were dozens.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.055
Sandra was worried
about another Gamergate,

11:29.121 --> 11:31.023
so she blocked your account.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.858
I'd call that motive.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.895
We know you confronted her.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.998
Yeah, so we had words.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.067
You violated our code
of conduct.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.102
You got any idea how
much money you cost me?

11:43.169 --> 11:44.336
(gasps)

11:44.403 --> 11:46.338
I broke her badge
when I grabbed it,

11:46.405 --> 11:47.973
but that's as far as it went.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.809
I never saw her again.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.811
So, no scratches
on your face.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.746
You want to show us your arms?

11:53.813 --> 11:55.214
Do I have to?

11:55.281 --> 11:57.216
No.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.218
You can go on
being the lead suspect

11:59.285 --> 12:01.320
in a murder investigation.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.028
Can I go now?

12:24.043 --> 12:26.078
David said
it's not going great?

12:27.046 --> 12:28.981
His lawyer doesn't think

12:29.048 --> 12:31.484
the neighbor's dog getting
killed is all that suspicious.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.085
Well, if we can link it
to your garage being robbed,

12:33.152 --> 12:34.520
he'll feel different.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.256
SIDLE: So Emma, tell me,
how did you and David meet?

12:37.323 --> 12:39.825
EMMA: Uh, he outbid me
in an eBay auction.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.061
There was this Three's Company
boxed set, and...

12:42.128 --> 12:44.530
(laughs)

12:42.128 --> 12:44.530
Uh, don't laugh.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.765
GRISSOM: Sara?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.765
Yeah.

12:52.404 --> 12:54.206
Brewski's skull fracture
was irregular.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.976
This could be our murder weapon.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.316
Let's get that back
to the lab, test it for DNA.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.188
We might not be done here yet.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.824
What's on the other
side of this door?

13:11.891 --> 13:13.792
It's a spare bedroom.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.162
It's gonna be a nursery,
but we need to paint it.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.936
When you said the junk was
stolen out of your garage,

13:24.003 --> 13:28.174
is there any chance that some
of that junk was stored in here?

13:29.208 --> 13:31.577
EMMA:
I am so sorry.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.579
It's got to be the
pregnancy brain.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.282
I forgot. I brought
some boxes in

13:36.348 --> 13:37.283
last month.

13:36.348 --> 13:37.283
SIDLE: This is probably

13:37.349 --> 13:39.285
the point of entry.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.353
I can't say for sure.
He cleaned up.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.994
Um, there should
be three of those.

13:49.061 --> 13:50.362
I know the
frames are ugly,

13:50.429 --> 13:52.298
but they were a gift
from David's mom.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.900
You didn't see one of these
in the storage unit, did you?

13:59.371 --> 14:00.973
SIDLE:
You know, if he stole one,

14:01.040 --> 14:02.107
it might not have been

14:02.174 --> 14:03.475
for set dressing.
It could explain

14:03.542 --> 14:05.110
how Hodges' prints
ended up there.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.413
Latent fingerprint fabrication.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.181
He rips the prints
and molds copies

14:09.248 --> 14:11.083
to plant all over the place.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.385
That's, like... diabolical.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.087
GRISSOM:
Well, let's not make him out

14:15.154 --> 14:17.423
to be a Bond villain just yet.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.959
Criminals make lots of mistakes.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.200
What is that?

14:28.267 --> 14:29.501
Is that something?

14:29.568 --> 14:31.070
GRISSOM:
I don't know,

14:31.136 --> 14:33.939
but if you don't either,
that's a good sign.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.411
Oh...

14:39.478 --> 14:41.947
Pow!

14:43.182 --> 14:45.951
The fountain water
had dried out.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.154
I made it reappear...
as if by magic.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.522
It's just

14:50.589 --> 14:53.025
copper sulfate
and an oxidizing reagent.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.928
You know, we're more likely
to find something

14:55.995 --> 14:57.129
the killer shed
on his getaway route

14:57.196 --> 14:58.664
than sloshing around
in that.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.134
One of us can follow their path.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.134
While the other one...

15:02.201 --> 15:04.670
You saw those dumpsters
on our walk in, same as me.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.641
We'll let fate decide
which one of us jumps in.

15:08.707 --> 15:11.010
I'm gonna leave you
to your street magic.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.978
But you owe me a drink.

Weapon Material

16:09.234 --> 16:11.170
These white knives are made

16:11.236 --> 16:13.572
of something strong enough to
kill, but can't scrape bone.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.541
What's polycarbonate
thermoplastic?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.309
Those came from a 3D printer?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.309
Yup.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.444
I did recognize them.

16:18.510 --> 16:19.978
They're replicas
of the knives

16:20.045 --> 16:22.247
used by Happy Hartigan,

16:22.314 --> 16:24.383
blue-skinned dude
in Sandra's video game.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.752
She was killed by knives
used in her own game?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.387
That's sick.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.255
Now I'm just going
through ATM footage

16:30.322 --> 16:32.157
on the killer's route.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.157
Hey.

16:32.224 --> 16:35.294
Sara, how's it going with
the, uh, animal cruelty case?

16:35.361 --> 16:36.695
Found a smudge.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.263
Got to love a good smudge.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.765
Hey, come visit for a sec?

16:42.234 --> 16:44.203
That's Nora Cross.
Thought you might want

16:44.269 --> 16:45.637
to avoid the inquisition.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.574
Thank you.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.310
(laughs)

16:48.640 --> 16:51.310
This is all so strange.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.312
I-I can't imagine what
I might be thinking

16:53.379 --> 16:55.047
if I was in your shoes.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.249
Well, you've been in our shoes.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.350
So has David Hodges.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.085
I don't think anyone

17:00.152 --> 17:02.020
who works here would risk
everything to cheat the system.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.188
I just don't believe it.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.725
I don't know the guy. Um,

17:06.792 --> 17:08.260
maybe he did it

17:08.327 --> 17:10.629
to look like a star.
Maybe he didn't.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.166
A bleeding heart
and a doubting Thomas?

17:14.233 --> 17:15.768
Sounds familiar.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.104
Who's the guy with the knives?

17:22.741 --> 17:25.778
Oh. We got one.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.513
(short chuckle)

17:32.818 --> 17:36.688
If you met Sandra,

17:36.755 --> 17:39.358
you loved Sandra.

17:39.425 --> 17:42.594
She, uh... she was selfless,

17:42.661 --> 17:45.297
and she was kind.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.434
She was driven and ambitious.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.439
She was the beating
heart of this...

17:53.505 --> 17:55.607
of this company,

17:55.674 --> 17:57.643
(feedback)

17:55.674 --> 17:57.643
which is, you know,
why it's so hard

17:57.709 --> 17:59.344
to be here with...

17:59.411 --> 18:01.613
Jimmy, can you...
can you bring that down?

18:01.680 --> 18:04.082
Just a...

18:04.149 --> 18:06.418
I wrap up,
you follow me over here.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.620
I land, and I say, "Welcome

18:08.687 --> 18:10.756
to your Death Spiral!"
Bam!

18:10.823 --> 18:13.692
Sirens!

18:10.823 --> 18:13.692
(siren blaring)

18:14.760 --> 18:17.596
Yeah, great.
Thanks, Jimmy.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.599
(sirens stop)

18:20.666 --> 18:23.202
Ben Miller, you're under arrest
for the murder of Sandra King.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.303
MILLER:
What? I...

18:24.369 --> 18:26.238
That's ridiculous.
She... This...

18:26.305 --> 18:27.606
She was my best friend.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.107
Show me his arms.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.242
What the hell's going on?

18:29.174 --> 18:30.242
I don't know.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.677
I don't know, man.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.111
There are no abrasions.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.515
She must have scratched
his accomplice.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.417
Okay, who were
you working with?

18:38.484 --> 18:41.119
This is crazy.
I-I'm innocent.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.855
I didn't... I...

18:41.186 --> 18:42.855
Move.

18:42.921 --> 18:46.158
Kelly, can you call
my lawyer, please? Now?

18:51.497 --> 18:53.365
The best part
of being out in the middle

18:53.432 --> 18:55.200
of the Pacific
is those phones are worthless.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.203
And my lab techs wouldn't have
anybody else to complain to.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.906
Is the, uh, Hodges case
hurting morale?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.708
Yeah. It ain't
a pizza party,

19:02.774 --> 19:05.177
with all the IAB
floating around.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.279
This thing could end badly.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.648
But you know what?

19:09.715 --> 19:11.383
I'd rather work than worry.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.889
Canine murder weapon.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.393
Possible
epithelial transfers.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.495
Mm-hmm.

19:25.297 --> 19:26.899
Hmm.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.379
We struck out twice.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.281
The rock and the smudge--
0 for two.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.283
Well, at least
mass spec came through.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.352
Dimethicone
and magnesium sulfate.

19:47.419 --> 19:48.820
That smudge was makeup.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.356
It was a body concealer
for arms and legs.

19:51.423 --> 19:53.825
It's possible our middle-aged,
South American man

19:53.892 --> 19:55.394
is covering a skin condition.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.529
I wonder how many men
know their way

19:57.596 --> 20:00.666
around Sephora
and LVPD evidence vault?

20:00.732 --> 20:03.702
That's a good place
to find a list of suspects.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.939
That evidence in the storage
unit had to come from somewhere.

20:07.005 --> 20:11.376
I'm not sure an unrelated animal
cruelty case justifies a trip

20:11.443 --> 20:13.445
to the police warehouse.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.516
Okay, I'll
think about it.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.253
(sighs)

20:22.454 --> 20:24.790
Hold on.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.558
Oh, yeah.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.962
I think a squirrel's been here.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.564
You're so negative.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.499
We might find something
in the fountain water

20:34.566 --> 20:36.935
that could identify
Ben Miller's accomplice.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.237
Be nice if Ben just told us
who he was working with.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.573
Where's the fun
in a confession?

20:41.640 --> 20:44.276
I think maybe your arms
are just getting weak.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.546

20:47.613 --> 20:50.248

21:18.710 --> 21:21.380
See that guy over there--
your 9:00 o'clock?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.881
I noticed him
when we got here.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.883
He's been watching us.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.453
Killers do return

21:25.884 --> 21:28.453
to crime scenes.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.757
Hey.

21:31.823 --> 21:36.528
Ed, um, I'd like to speak
to that guy over there.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.765
Excuse me, sir.
Can we just have a word?

21:40.766 --> 21:41.733
Allie!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.069
Stop!

21:46.838 --> 21:48.073
(groans)

21:50.809 --> 21:51.810
(grunts)

21:51.877 --> 21:52.911
Sorry!

21:59.418 --> 22:01.053
(tires squeal)

22:01.119 --> 22:02.888
(man shouts)

22:12.764 --> 22:14.966
Don't!

22:16.168 --> 22:17.903
Just stay where you are.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.672
Hands.
Give me your hands.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.808
What was that?
Why'd you run?

22:22.874 --> 22:25.444
Those are
great questions for you.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.779
Since when do you chase people,
you maniac?

22:27.846 --> 22:30.115
Oh.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.751
Well, I-I didn't
do nothing wrong.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.519
Nobody's trying
to take you in.

22:34.586 --> 22:35.854
We just want to talk about why

22:35.921 --> 22:37.055
you were watching
the crime scene.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.055
Oh,

22:37.122 --> 22:39.024
well, I-I...
I live across the street.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.093
I-I can't sleep
without that fountain.

22:41.159 --> 22:43.428
Uh...

22:41.159 --> 22:43.428
Were you there the night
of the murder, Mr. Benson?

22:43.495 --> 22:44.963
Yeah, yeah.
Uh,

22:45.030 --> 22:46.765
I was getting ready
to go to sleep,

22:46.832 --> 22:48.967
and I-I... I saw
the whole thing.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.536
There's no blood.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.440
Wh-What happened?

22:55.507 --> 22:56.775
What happened?

22:56.842 --> 22:58.577
Uh, well, I tried

22:58.643 --> 23:02.013
to help that lady
when that lunatic jumped her.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.816
I mean, the dude
came out of nowhere.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.852
Uh, the lady--
I mean, she-she punched him.

23:06.918 --> 23:08.453
Bam. Just...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.789
But dude was, uh, ice cold.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.524
He had this look.

23:12.591 --> 23:14.993
His face was, like, frozen.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.462
He had his, uh--
I-I don't know--

23:17.529 --> 23:19.464
must have been, uh, knives.

23:20.932 --> 23:22.000
(screaming)

23:22.067 --> 23:23.602
And he's stabbing her, and

23:23.668 --> 23:24.903
he just kept stabbing her and...

23:29.007 --> 23:31.610
Why did you run
from us, Mr. Benson?

23:31.676 --> 23:33.779
I thought y'all would blame me.

23:33.845 --> 23:35.714
I mean, I was there
when it happened.

23:35.781 --> 23:38.617
Do you recognize this man?

23:38.683 --> 23:40.619
That's the guy.

23:40.685 --> 23:42.654
I saw him real good
when he got out of the fountain.

23:42.721 --> 23:45.423
I thought he was chasing me
When I ran, and I ran right past

23:45.490 --> 23:46.525
this other woman.

23:49.628 --> 23:52.097
God, I'm so sorry.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.199
Why? What are you
sorry about?

23:55.867 --> 23:58.603
I-I didn't stop him.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.775
I know he's off his meds, but...

24:03.842 --> 24:05.544
He's not lying.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.679
Some of those details were
never released to the press.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.981
There's no scratches on him,
not one drop of blood,

24:10.048 --> 24:13.018
and I highly doubt
that guy does much 3D printing.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.853
I guess Miller could
have acted alone.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.688
How many people does it take
to stab somebody?

24:16.755 --> 24:19.524
Yeah, but Sandra scratched
somebody when she got attacked.

24:19.591 --> 24:22.828
If it's not Miller,
then who's in the ATM video?

24:24.162 --> 24:27.232
No. Imposible.
Estoy en Las Vegas.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.900
Comprendo.

24:28.967 --> 24:34.139
Quatro punto
cinco ocho. Gracias.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.741
The, uh, Ishmael
is getting evicted.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.577
I have to find a new
home for the boat.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.878
Maybe you shouldn't
have told them

24:39.945 --> 24:41.780
about the termites
eating the boat dock.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.481
Termites never sleep.

24:43.548 --> 24:46.551
That can be a fun fact
or a sunken boatyard.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.688
Are you okay?

24:49.754 --> 24:52.090
You look a little tired.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.090
No, no, I'm fine.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.125
Just... (sighs)

24:54.192 --> 24:57.729
I'm gonna spend all night
calling Peruvian marinas.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.236
Everyone
who's visited the evidence vault

25:04.302 --> 25:05.937
within the last year.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.739
Hope your guy's in there.

25:07.806 --> 25:09.507
You went over there?
Thank you so much.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.509
I didn't do it
for you.

25:11.576 --> 25:13.044
Or for me.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.747
If we're gonna restore
people's faith in what we do,

25:15.814 --> 25:17.816
then we got to have the truth.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.784
And I don't think
Washoe can get it.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.821
Hey, if anybody asks...

25:19.851 --> 25:22.821
Come on.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.791
If they need a fall guy,

25:26.858 --> 25:28.760
it's gonna be me.

25:28.827 --> 25:31.596
Just go get this right.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.735
FOLSOM:
See that? I think you're looking

25:36.801 --> 25:38.136
at the face of
an innocent man.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.272
Bloody knives, murderous
glint in his eyes.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.574
Yeah, he looks like
a gentle soul.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.076
Wait, you're serious?

25:45.143 --> 25:46.711
There could be a reason
we got this look at him.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.046
He might have
run past this ATM

25:48.113 --> 25:49.981
and turned his head
on purpose.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.917
And why would Miller do that?

25:51.983 --> 25:53.151
I doubt he would, but

25:53.218 --> 25:55.987
we don't think
this is Ben Miller.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.689
RAJAN:
Look what happens

25:57.756 --> 25:59.224
when you run this through
chromaticity software.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.962
380 nanometers.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.664
Blue.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.633
640 nanometers.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.702
Light brown.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.837
Now take another
look at Ben Miller.

26:14.172 --> 26:15.941
He has brown eyes.

26:16.007 --> 26:18.777
We found this brown contact lens
in the fountain

26:18.843 --> 26:20.245
where Sandra King
was killed.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.713
Found an eyewitness who said

26:21.780 --> 26:22.881
Sandra punched the guy
in his right eye.

26:22.948 --> 26:24.649
(grunts)

26:22.948 --> 26:24.649
We think the killer

26:24.716 --> 26:26.184
has blue eyes.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.787
So, that explains
the eyes, but...

26:28.853 --> 26:30.322
The real killer--

26:30.388 --> 26:31.623
this man-- we think

26:31.690 --> 26:33.091
he wore a 3D printed mask

26:33.158 --> 26:34.759
of Miller's face,

26:34.826 --> 26:37.829
got caught on tape
to frame him.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.599
When's the last time
y'all been drug tested?

26:41.666 --> 26:42.934
I'm serious. You want to see
something trippy? Look at this.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.669
High-end 3D printers can make

26:44.736 --> 26:46.805
almost anything.
Even faces.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.040
RAJAN:
We know the killer
had access to one.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.342
He made the murder weapons.

26:50.408 --> 26:51.910
FOLSOM:
And a mask would explain

26:51.977 --> 26:53.778
why our eyewitness said

26:53.845 --> 26:56.348
the killer's expression
never changed.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.283
It would explain how we still
haven't matched the skin

26:58.350 --> 26:59.851
under Sandra's nails.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.220
All right.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.621
Find me some proof.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.328
(grunting)

27:11.396 --> 27:13.231
(laughing)

27:11.396 --> 27:13.231
No.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.266
No, no, no, no, no. No.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.869
Angle's still wrong.
Okay.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.005
And I haven't gotten
a decent scratch in, either.

27:22.273 --> 27:24.309
Okay, these...

27:24.376 --> 27:26.077
these came from the fountain--
him on top of her--

27:26.144 --> 27:28.013
but these two...

27:28.079 --> 27:30.115
What if she punched him
before they hit the water?

27:30.181 --> 27:31.783
If he stumbled?

27:35.286 --> 27:36.755
(grunts, gasps)

27:36.821 --> 27:38.757
I am so sorry.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.757
(chuckles)

27:38.823 --> 27:40.158
Did I hurt you?

27:40.225 --> 27:41.192
No.

27:41.259 --> 27:43.428
You know what?
I think, uh...

27:43.495 --> 27:45.864
I think your video game
would be Street Fighter.

27:46.865 --> 27:48.433
Never heard of that either?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.301
How many cricket
players do you know?

27:50.368 --> 27:53.371
Okay. Uh,

27:53.438 --> 27:55.273
say he did tumble back.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.273
Mm-hmm.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.043
Like this, though.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.078
Stabbing down from here,
he'd hit her leg.

28:00.145 --> 28:01.946
But that's not it. It...

28:02.013 --> 28:03.381
Here.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.684
Boom.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.684
Okay.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.686
That's what it was.
So I am losing blood.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.955
I'm grabbing for
whatever's closest.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.955
Uh-huh.

28:12.323 --> 28:14.993
Left forearm.
That's where it'll be.

28:12.323 --> 28:14.993
Yup.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.029
Ben and I have spent years
developing Death Spiral.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.798
It's our baby.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.232
We actually came up
with a rough idea

28:21.299 --> 28:23.101
on one of our 15-minute
coffee breaks,

28:23.168 --> 28:25.403
and now it's become this.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.039
It's been a wild journey,
and it's one

28:28.106 --> 28:30.141
I can't imagine being on
without Ben.

28:37.148 --> 28:38.416
(knocking)

28:39.417 --> 28:41.152
You're still here?

28:41.219 --> 28:43.188
Allie and I tried
some iterations on the attack.

28:43.254 --> 28:47.125
Pretty sure this is where
Sandra scratched the killer.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.494
It doesn't give us
a suspect, but...

28:49.561 --> 28:51.329
I know where to look
when I find one.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.198
Yeah.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.835
Pulling a double?

28:54.399 --> 28:56.835
I got this rule:

28:56.901 --> 29:00.305
don't put innocent people
behind bars.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.210
I'm not doing Hawaiian again.

29:06.978 --> 29:09.447
Mmm. So...

29:09.514 --> 29:12.083
I ripped my ACL
senior year.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.752
I had to relearn
how to walk.

29:14.819 --> 29:16.087
That was a real
education.

29:16.154 --> 29:20.358
Now, what we have here
is a wire frame

29:20.425 --> 29:22.961
of our killer's gait
from the ATM footage.

29:23.027 --> 29:24.295
And we're comparing
his stride model to, what--

29:24.362 --> 29:25.864
people walking around

29:25.930 --> 29:27.398
at a company party?

29:25.930 --> 29:27.398
I had Kelly Li

29:27.465 --> 29:29.400
send me some footage.
The employees

29:29.467 --> 29:31.402
sound like a good place
to start.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.205
No two humans move the same way.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.274
Anthropometric differences

29:36.341 --> 29:40.512
in our feet, our hips,
even our toes.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.414
It all adds up to locomotion
that is unique

29:43.481 --> 29:45.416
as a fingerprint.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.087
Okay, so

29:49.154 --> 29:50.788
Ben Miller has got

29:50.855 --> 29:51.956
a hitch in his giddyup.

29:52.023 --> 29:53.391
Biomechanically speaking,
of course.

31:33.358 --> 31:36.628
and wrongful imprisonment claims
will be rolled into one case.

31:36.694 --> 31:38.930
The law firm
of Anson Wix and Associates

31:38.997 --> 31:40.898
was appointed lead counsel.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.898
I've never heard of them.

31:40.965 --> 31:43.134
Wix said, "It's a simple

31:40.965 --> 31:43.134
A trial with
this much press,

31:43.201 --> 31:44.502
"question: should misconduct

31:43.201 --> 31:44.502
and it goes to someone
I have never heard of.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.538
"by law enforcement
ruin the lives of 8,000?

31:47.605 --> 31:50.141
"Mr. Hodges is going
to have his day in court.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.143
My clients will, too."

31:52.210 --> 31:53.544
MILLER:
Are you serious?

31:53.611 --> 31:56.514
Wouldn't be here
if we weren't.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.020
The cops kept saying they had
a video of me, and I just...

32:02.086 --> 32:04.022
I thought they
were lying.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.291
They weren't.
The video exists.

32:06.357 --> 32:07.325
It's just not the real you.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.160
ROBY:
Does Ron Kean

32:09.227 --> 32:12.530
have the technical expertise
to make a map of your face?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.932
Ron knows more
about photorealistic rendering

32:14.999 --> 32:17.201
than anyone I've ever met.
That's why

32:17.268 --> 32:18.436
Sandra and I
hired him.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.305
Okay, but 3D printing
takes time.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.240
Would he have been able
to do it at work

32:22.307 --> 32:24.042
without anyone noticing?

32:24.108 --> 32:25.710
Yeah... (sighs)

32:25.777 --> 32:27.979
I mean, I guess.

32:28.046 --> 32:31.015
We let him set his own hours
because he has to check in

32:31.082 --> 32:32.150
on his mom.
She's older,

32:32.216 --> 32:35.053
she lives in, um...
Red Rock.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.355
But Ron-- uh, uh,
it makes no sense.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.490
He never gets angry.

32:39.557 --> 32:43.394
Even when things don't go
his way, he is just super chill.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.264
Something not go his way
recently?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.000
We had a contest

32:49.067 --> 32:50.501
last month,
in-house.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.203
Best employee idea--

32:52.270 --> 32:53.705
their game got put
into development.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.307
It came down to Kelly and Ron,
and she won.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.575
How'd he take the rejection?

32:57.642 --> 32:59.477
He said, uh,
"I believe in my game.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.112
"I'm gonna keep working on it

33:01.179 --> 33:03.614
until I can find a way
to get it made, somehow."

33:03.681 --> 33:05.316
And somehow, here we are.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.553
Don't let them
keep me locked up.

33:08.619 --> 33:10.688
Please.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.993
We need warrants.
One for Ron Kean's car,

33:16.060 --> 33:18.062
another for his DNA
to check against the skin

33:18.129 --> 33:20.331
under her nails.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.331
Don't have evidence to compel.

33:20.398 --> 33:22.100
We've got
that wireframe.

33:22.166 --> 33:25.036
No judge has ever issued
a warrant on gait analysis.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.537
The-the field's too new.

33:26.604 --> 33:30.241
I mean, it-it rarely even
gets into tr...

33:30.308 --> 33:33.144
I think I know where
there might be some DNA.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.213
We don't even need a warrant.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.459
(sniffles, sighs)

34:01.239 --> 34:03.341
KEAN:
Yeah, I just got to grab my
cue cards. I'll be right there.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.443
Oh, and take another
look at the shard

34:05.510 --> 34:07.078
before the second round starts.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.646
Thanks.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.685
Dr. Roby.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.685
Mm.

34:14.752 --> 34:16.387
What brings you back?

34:16.454 --> 34:18.189
You know, I lost my wallet,

34:18.256 --> 34:19.323
and I think I may have

34:19.390 --> 34:21.392
left it in here.

34:21.459 --> 34:23.127
Oh, there they are.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.163
Opening remarks.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.163
Oh.

34:27.198 --> 34:29.333
Well, I'm sorry I can't
stay and help you look,

34:29.400 --> 34:31.836
but the second round's about
to start, and I'm hosting.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.672
Yeah.
You're the big man.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.707
You're next in line
at the company, hmm?

34:36.774 --> 34:38.709
Oh, well,
there was no succession plan,

34:38.776 --> 34:40.411
so we had to have a vote.
(laughs)

34:40.478 --> 34:42.146
I mean, okay,

34:42.213 --> 34:44.282
I mean, it was a lucky break.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.684
Congratulations.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.153
I worked very hard for it.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.153
Mm.

34:49.220 --> 34:53.825
Mr. Kean, would you mind
showing me your left forearm,

34:53.891 --> 34:56.427
please?

34:57.728 --> 34:59.797
Without a warrant?

35:00.798 --> 35:02.667
Good luck with the search.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.502
Hmm.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.677
You want photos?
I've got photos.

35:12.743 --> 35:15.112
Nevada's new system
has a kind of yearbook.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.582
Your evidence vault visitors
will be here.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.450
There's even an alum section.

35:20.751 --> 35:23.321
Oh, that face.
I'm gonna need a copy.

35:23.387 --> 35:25.289
(laughs)
I'll print you one.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.291
What?

35:27.358 --> 35:28.392
Excuse me.
May I?

35:31.829 --> 35:33.664
(laughs)

35:31.829 --> 35:33.664
ROBY:
Just the man

35:33.731 --> 35:35.733
I was looking for.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.869
I need a bug ID'd.

35:37.935 --> 35:40.872
May I see the specimen?

35:37.935 --> 35:40.872
Part of it. All I got is

35:40.938 --> 35:42.707
his stinger.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.707
Her sting.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.809
The aculeus is
a female organ.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.613
(laughs)
I think

35:48.679 --> 35:50.515
you may have found one
of my favorite insects.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.250
The kind that solves crimes.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.801
You got it.

36:10.868 --> 36:14.305
Apidae Apinae Anthophorini.

36:14.372 --> 36:15.673
It's a digger bee.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.342
The males dig
to find females for mating.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.544
The young are raised
underground.

36:19.610 --> 36:20.711
This is a rare find.
These bees

36:20.778 --> 36:22.513
doesn't usually sting,

36:22.580 --> 36:24.248
unless their ground nest
has been disturbed.

36:24.315 --> 36:26.284
By someone burying something?

36:26.350 --> 36:28.452
Well, if the nest
was full of larvae

36:28.519 --> 36:30.555
in the brood chamber, yeah.

36:30.621 --> 36:34.458
ROBY:
So our suspect's mother
lives in Red Rock Canyon.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.594
If he went there
the morning after the murder

36:36.661 --> 36:39.263
and happened
to disturb a ground nest...

36:39.997 --> 36:41.532
...I want to know why.

36:41.599 --> 36:43.534
"If I be waspish,

36:43.601 --> 36:45.603
best beware my sting."

36:52.944 --> 36:54.679
Found another nest.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.914
Hasn't been touched, though.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.914
ROBY: Then why

36:56.981 --> 36:59.617
do I want to hear about it? It's
too hot to yell about nothing.

37:04.488 --> 37:05.957
(buzzing)

37:21.672 --> 37:24.008
Hey, I think I've got something.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.513
FOLSOM:
I'm still amazed
Ron's mom let us search

37:29.580 --> 37:31.015
without a warrant.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.883
Says a lot about her
feelings for old Ronny boy.

37:32.950 --> 37:36.387
Dead larvae, collapsed cells.
Something happened to this nest.

37:36.454 --> 37:38.456
Looks like somebody
got at it with a shovel.

37:38.522 --> 37:39.557
Those marks?

37:39.624 --> 37:40.925
This dirt's been dug up

37:40.992 --> 37:42.426
and packed back down again.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.332
What is it?

37:49.400 --> 37:50.835
He burned it.

37:50.901 --> 37:55.573
Oh. Gave it the
full Darth Vader.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.018
ROBY:
Thermoplastic polyurethane.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.519
Same as the knives.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.054
And power tools
and sporting goods.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.989
TPUs are kind of in everything.

38:12.056 --> 38:13.991
Circumstantial.

38:14.058 --> 38:15.893
This won't be.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.928
Salivary amylase here.

38:17.995 --> 38:20.531
Then DNA is there, too.

38:22.833 --> 38:25.636
Hey, Ron, what was the name
of your game gonna be?

38:25.703 --> 38:28.506
Um, Shadow Blade Sorcerers.

38:28.572 --> 38:31.075
Mm. I mean,
no wonder they passed.

38:32.576 --> 38:33.744
Is this why I'm here?

38:33.811 --> 38:35.546
No. This is.

38:35.613 --> 38:36.647
Do you recognize this guy?

38:36.714 --> 38:39.350
Yeah, of course.
That's Ben.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.585
No, that's you with

38:41.652 --> 38:44.822
a Ben Miller mask right after
you killed Sandra King.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.625
That's...

38:47.692 --> 38:49.694
I had nothing
to do with this.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.395
Actually, you had everything
to do with it,

38:51.462 --> 38:52.797
because we found
your crispy mask

38:52.863 --> 38:54.799
that you buried
on your mom's property.

38:54.865 --> 38:58.035
If Sandra's killer wore a mask,

38:58.102 --> 38:59.904
then it could have been anyone.

38:59.970 --> 39:01.906
Wrong again, because

39:01.972 --> 39:03.441
the buccal epithelial cells

39:03.507 --> 39:06.043
we found in the mask are yours.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.112
Mama Kean's propane torch

39:08.179 --> 39:10.948
didn't burn hot enough

39:11.015 --> 39:14.351
to destroy the mask.

39:14.418 --> 39:16.721
You couldn't turn it to ash,

39:16.787 --> 39:19.790
so you buried it.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.092
That was a mistake.

39:21.158 --> 39:25.062
See, I thought
you were upset

39:25.129 --> 39:27.665
because one of your bosses
had just been killed.

39:27.732 --> 39:31.702
But the red eyes and runny nose
was just a reaction

39:31.769 --> 39:34.972
to the digger bee venom.

39:38.075 --> 39:41.412
Roll up your left sleeve, Ron.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.581
This time you have to.

39:50.588 --> 39:52.757
You're under arrest. You
have the right to remain...

39:52.823 --> 39:53.858
"Your time's
coming, Ron."

39:53.924 --> 39:55.960
"Next year, Ron."

39:56.994 --> 40:00.865
Sandra and Ben strung me along
for years, and they picked her.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.567
You killed one of your bosses
and framed the other one

40:03.634 --> 40:05.636
'cause they picked Kelly Li's
game over yours?

40:05.703 --> 40:08.806
They picked Kelly because
female coders get fawning press

40:08.873 --> 40:10.441
no matter what crap
they put out.

40:10.508 --> 40:13.811
And everybody
knows it.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.713
ROBY:
Well, don't worry.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.149
Your face'll be
on the front page soon enough.

40:20.584 --> 40:23.487
SIDLE:
Robert Gomez, silver fox.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.489
Nice complexion.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.158
I like him.

40:27.224 --> 40:28.859
What? As a suspect, I hope.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.461
Very funny.

40:30.528 --> 40:34.098
Ten matches. I think
we're looking at our guy.

40:34.165 --> 40:37.535
We just don't know
who he is yet. But we will.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.809
Honey, uh,
I got a problem.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.112
I thought
it would go away, but...

40:48.179 --> 40:49.847
The coordinates of the marina.

40:49.914 --> 40:51.849
It's not my hearing.

40:51.916 --> 40:56.487
I couldn't focus on the map
to trace the longitude.

40:56.554 --> 40:59.557
And it comes in waves.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.192
That's how it feels--
like I never left the boat.

41:01.258 --> 41:03.828
You're land sick?

41:01.258 --> 41:03.828
It's called, uh,

41:03.894 --> 41:07.464
Mal de Debarquement. French.

41:07.531 --> 41:08.799
They say if it doesn't go away

41:08.866 --> 41:11.702
in a few days,
sometimes it never does.

41:12.503 --> 41:16.106
Well, there must be
something, right? I mean...

41:19.643 --> 41:24.982
We'll figure it out, okay?

41:25.049 --> 41:27.151
I'll never go away.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.654
If you need to hold on to
something, hold on to me.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.867
(video game song plays)

41:43.801 --> 41:46.704
(both chuckle)

41:53.077 --> 41:55.112
(whispers indistinctly)

41:57.915 --> 42:01.018
You see what your mom did?

42:01.085 --> 42:03.654
(laughs)

42:04.655 --> 42:06.924
(phone chimes)

42:15.199 --> 42:17.067
Damn.
