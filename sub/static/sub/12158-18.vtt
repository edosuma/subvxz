<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>is recorded</i>

00:04.538 --> 00:06.505
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.007
Huh. For a bunch
of college kids,

00:08.009 --> 00:09.675
This fashion show's
really impressive.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.276
Why? 'cause
they make clothes?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.545
8-year-olds do this
in sweatshops every day.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.850
I'm enjoying
the heck out of this, Mike.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.819
Music, colors,
spectacle.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.055
Ever since you opened up
that pot shop,

00:23.057 --> 00:24.957
The whole world's
just one big

00:24.959 --> 00:27.993
Pink floyd laser light show
to you, isn't it?

00:27.995 --> 00:30.662
I just <i>sell</i> the marijuana.
I don't use it.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.066
If I want to get dizzy,
I'll climb a flight of stairs.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.502
Kyle. Kyle!
You can zip her up.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.971
If you were zipping her <i>down,</i>
<i>maybe I would have a problem.</i>

00:38.973 --> 00:41.473
It's okay. I'm good at doing
this with my eyes closed.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.642
I help my grandma get dressed
all the time.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.679
Eve, why aren't you dressed?
We're up next.

00:47.681 --> 00:48.981
Yeah.
Small problem.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.182
There's a mirror
in there.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.316
I-I'm not wearing this
in public.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.484
Come on.
You can pull this off.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.819
I know.
I just did.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.154
You can give me
something else to wear

00:55.156 --> 00:57.923
Or eight of these
sewn into a burka.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.860
This is why tim gunn would call
a "make it work" moment.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.262
Eve, look.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.497
I know that you aren't
that into fashion,

01:05.499 --> 01:07.499
But you are the kind of model
every designer dreams of.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.336
Really?
Yes. You have the body
of a 12-year-old boy.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.540
Keep talking and I'll have the
head of a 19-year-old sister.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.942
You said that you
would help me with this.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.344
If you don't,
I'm gonna fail the class.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.914
Fine.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.020
According to the program,
Mandy's up next.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.522
And we can get
a pretty sweet discount

01:30.524 --> 01:32.791
From a local
print shop.

Announcer:
<i>Now here's a collection from</i>
<i>freshman designer Mandy Baxter.</i>

01:38.631 --> 01:40.933
Why do they always
look so angry?

01:40.935 --> 01:43.635
Maybe they took denver
in the super bowl.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.804
[ chuckles ]
oh, now <i>I'm</i> angry.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.640
I'd be pretty angry, too,
if I hadn't eaten since I was 9.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.042
Come on.
It's the style.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.710
They're supposed
to look fierce.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.145
That's not
fierce.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.214
The viet cong
were fierce.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.649
Fierce is angrier,
meaner,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.051
More like, uh...

01:59.053 --> 02:00.119
That.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.988
[ gasps ]

02:02.990 --> 02:06.258

to my son?

02:08.229 --> 02:10.963
Vanessa:
Eve looks amazing.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.332
It's been so long since
I've seen her legs
without shin guards.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.301
Watch those high heels.
Don't roll your ankle. Eve!

02:17.237 --> 02:20.339
You got a soccer game
on Saturday.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.143
[ cheers and applause ]

02:24.145 --> 02:26.545
<i>Designer Mandy Baxter.</i>

02:31.317 --> 02:34.686
Well, feminism has come
full circle.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.954
50 years ago,
women went to college

02:35.956 --> 02:37.789
So they <i>wouldn't</i>
<i>have to sew.</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:39.591
I was really impressed
with Mandy's designs.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.260
I always knew
there was something going on

02:41.262 --> 02:42.861
In that pretty little head
of hers.

02:42.863 --> 02:46.598
I always pictured a wind-up
monkey playing cymbals.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.101
And, evie, wow!

02:49.103 --> 02:51.770
Honey, honey, you were like
a real runway model.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.772
Yeah. I'm gonna go
take a shower.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.875
I wonder which body scrub
is best for washing away shame.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.878
Hello, everyone.
Ah, here she is!

02:59.880 --> 03:01.780
Bravo, Mandy.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.349
Honey, god, your collection
was so fresh and original.
Thank you.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.952
You really did
a good job.
Thanks, dad.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.220
You know,
I could see myself

03:08.222 --> 03:09.988
Rocking one of these
cute little rompers.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.324
Yeah. You know,
it's just that they're, um,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.359
Well, they're rompers,
not mom-pers.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.995
I'm trying to build
a brand now.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.797
You know,
somebody might see you.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.033
Fine. I'll just wear
the competition's clothes, then.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.302
Oh, would you?
That would be great, actually.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.537
You know, you better
take it easy on your mom.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.172
This will happen
to you one day.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.675
Hey!
[ laughs ]

03:29.677 --> 03:31.410
Yeah, thanks
for having my back.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.745
You better watch yours
while you're sleeping.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.314
You know, Mandy,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.382
Your clothes definitely got
the best response.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.251
Your -- your teacher must
have been super impressed.

03:39.253 --> 03:42.054
Uh, yeah. Not impressed enough,
though. She gave me a b-minus.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.488
Really?
Seriously?

03:43.490 --> 03:45.357
Seriously. She said
it was "derivative."

03:45.359 --> 03:47.359
I guess I've seen things
like this before,

03:47.361 --> 03:50.062
But, you know,
then again, I'm 100.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.699
You shouldn't let one tough
teacher discourage you, okay?
Yeah, I won't.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.900
Good for you.
Mm-hmm.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.468
'cause I'm
quitting school.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.005
What?
I mean, I'm wasting my time
in college.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.573
You saw that response
today.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.375
Even <i>you</i> wanted
one of my rompers.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.177
I am literally
turning away orders.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.445
So if you guys need me,

04:06.447 --> 04:09.615
I will be downstairs
making magic.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.916
Did you hear
what she just said?

04:10.918 --> 04:12.184
She's talking about
quitting school.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.285
All I heard was

04:13.287 --> 04:16.255
A wind-up monkey playing
cymbals.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.358
-- Captions by vitac --

04:23.096 --> 04:24.730
We're not gonna let her
quit school.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.198
I'm kind of with Mandy.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.966
What does a college education
even mean anymore?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.569
Well, had you finished college,
maybe you'd know.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.037
I am just saying,

04:32.039 --> 04:34.273
A million people graduate
from college every year

04:34.275 --> 04:36.541
And there are only
5,000 jobs.
What?

04:36.543 --> 04:38.110
I'm just making stuff up
like you do.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.579
Listen.

04:40.581 --> 04:44.383
Once obama's out of office,
there's gonna be jobs again.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.787
Someone's sure looking forward
to <i>hillary's</i> economic recovery.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.794
What? What does she know?
She's got a g.E.D.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.429
When do you want
to go downstairs

04:57.431 --> 04:58.497
And straighten out Mandy?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.098
[ sighs ]

05:00.100 --> 05:04.036
When this level
gets to right about here.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.173
Hey. Oh, my god.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.975
So, I just came up
with a name for my company --

05:09.977 --> 05:11.576
Mandy candy.
[ chuckles ]

05:13.112 --> 05:16.381
Nope. Urban dictionary says
that's a street name for crack.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.284
So never mind.
[ chuckles ]

05:19.286 --> 05:21.820
Mandy, honey, we're not
letting you quit college.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.755
Why not? You guys
let me quit saxophone.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.158
That was really
more for <i>us.</i>

05:26.160 --> 05:28.327
Okay. But hear me out. I have
the whole thing figured out.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.330
Ready? So, my tuition
is $6,000, right?
Mm-hmm.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.098
So, instead
of paying that,

05:33.100 --> 05:35.133
You guys should
just give me $5,000

05:35.135 --> 05:36.935
So I can start
my business.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.704
Boom!
I just made you $1,000.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.772
You're welcome.
It's a no-brainer.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.374
It certainly is.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.811
What would you even do
with $5,000?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.446
Well, if I'm gonna
make rompers,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.214
Than I need to buy
more materials

05:49.216 --> 05:50.882
And I can't use
my credit card.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.651
Wait. You --
you maxed out your credit card?

05:52.653 --> 05:53.652
What? No.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.721
I'm not irresponsible,
mom.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.724
I lost it.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.459
Um...

06:00.461 --> 06:02.494
By the way, what do you do
when that happens?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.029
I know you're
supposed to, like,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.530
Call the number on the back
of the card, yeah?

06:05.532 --> 06:06.665
But, like,
how dumb is that?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.567
Because I don't have
the card.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.137
Wherever the card is now,
it's maxed out.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.039
Honey, we -- we can't let her
ruin her credit.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.640
We're gonna have to cancel
the card

06:15.642 --> 06:17.209
And we've got to pay off
all her debt.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.377
Calm down, bernanke.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.045
We're not gonna
bail her out.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.646
She's not too big
to fail.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.882
Well, why don't you guys
just give me

06:23.884 --> 06:25.984
The $5,000
to launch my brand

06:25.986 --> 06:28.820
And then I can pay you back
when I'm rich?

06:28.822 --> 06:31.656
Or you go back
to school.

06:31.658 --> 06:35.360
As much as I hate giving up that
$1,000 you found to give me.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.162
You guys can't make me
stay in school.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.697
We can't <i>make</i> you?

06:38.699 --> 06:41.733
You're in a sound-proof basement
with a sewing machine.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.435
I could make a suit
out of you.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.271
This is so unfair.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.672
You're always telling us
to follow our dreams

06:47.674 --> 06:50.842
And, like,
swing for the goal posts.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.577
I don't think anybody
ever said that.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.914
The one thing
that I really want to do,

as you're living here

06:59.353 --> 07:01.920
And we're paying
for everything!

07:03.256 --> 07:05.090
Are we crushing
her dream?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.425
We keep crushing them,

07:06.427 --> 07:08.860
And they keep coming up
with new ones.

That's sad.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.259
It's sad that you took time
to do that calculation.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.328
No, it's sad that you do
all that signing.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.330
It's sad about
the hair.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.832
Everything's sad.
It's all sad.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.835
Oh, well.
I'm rich, so I win.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.371
Do you ever regret
not going to college?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.472
Did you hear me?

09:00.474 --> 09:02.807
I'm rich. I won.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.743
Although, there was
this movie I saw once --

09:04.745 --> 09:06.344
Made college seem
like a lot of fun.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.747
It was called
"the animal house."

09:08.749 --> 09:10.649
Mandy wants to quit
going to college

09:10.651 --> 09:12.317
And start her own business.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.086
Attagirl. A lot of successful
guys didn't get their degrees --

09:15.088 --> 09:18.423
Steve jobs, bill gates,
mark zuckerberg.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.724
Name one more.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.626
Everybody mentions
those three.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.164
Statistically, people
with diplomas make more money

09:26.166 --> 09:27.933
Than people
that don't have them.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.935
Maybe if bill gates
had gone to college,

09:29.937 --> 09:31.603
Instead of being
a billionaire,

09:31.605 --> 09:33.371
He would have been
a <i>trillionaire.</i>

09:33.373 --> 09:35.607
That's got
to haunt him.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.509
Everything isn't
about money.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.345
Yeah, for some of us,
it's about finding our bliss.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.681
Luckily,
your bliss is money.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.050
What's Mandy's?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.184
Fashion design.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.220
That's a terrible bliss.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.289
Kid should stay in school.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.724
I beg your pardon,
sirs,

09:52.726 --> 09:54.392
But I believe in
Mandy's fashion career.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.528
I mean, she's already got
two major investors.

09:56.530 --> 09:57.762
Who?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.464
Well, I'm in
for 20 big ones.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.132
<i>Dollars.</i>

10:02.868 --> 10:05.236
And her grandfather
gave her $5,000.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.404
What?

10:06.406 --> 10:07.706
That's -- that's nuts.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.542
I know.
It's a risky investment.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.877
It's a risk
I'm willing to take.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.915
Well, looks like your dad
is raking in the dough

10:16.917 --> 10:18.617
At the marijuana store,
huh?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.719
Another guy
who didn't go to college.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.487
Just because you're rich
doesn't mean you're smart.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.024
You <i>are</i> talking about
your dad, right?

10:27.059 --> 10:28.293
Sure.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.172
So, are you guys
letting Mandy quit school?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.607
No way.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.275
Your dad is pretty mad
at your grandpa

10:44.277 --> 10:45.844
For sticking his nose in
with her.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.912
That's hilarious.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.914
Dad does nothing <i>but</i> interfere
with how Ryan and I raise Boyd.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.316
Honey,
your father feels like

10:51.318 --> 10:52.951
He's got something
to teach Boyd.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.686
Oh, yeah, sure --

10:54.688 --> 10:57.622
Lotion on door knobs, plastic
wrap across toilet seats.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.658
Lotion on toilet seats.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.126
[ laughs ]

11:01.128 --> 11:04.763
One time, I slid right off
into the hallway.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.599
Um, yeah, well,

11:07.601 --> 11:10.301
I can't believe grandpa bud
gave Mandy 5,000 bucks.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.038
I mean, does he remember
he has <i>three</i> granddaughters?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.774
You know, he sometimes
even jokes that he's
got    <i>fo</i>granddaughters

11:15.776 --> 11:17.342
Because I look so...Young.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.114
How's, uh, h-how's your history
paper coming over there?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.516
Great.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.850
I'm thinking about
dropping out of school

11:25.852 --> 11:28.620
And opening up
a history business.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.622
Where's <i>my</i> 5,000 bucks?

11:30.624 --> 11:34.159
Nice try, but the role
of school dropout in this family

11:34.161 --> 11:35.794
Has already been filled.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.629
Wow.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.130
I -- okay.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.465
I am managing
<i>two</i> restaurants, okay,

11:40.467 --> 11:41.866
And probably making
more than you did

11:41.868 --> 11:43.635
When you started off
as a geologist.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.370
I didn't get into geology
for the money.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.440
Mm. So, was it for the fame
or all the free rocks?

11:49.842 --> 11:52.377
You can't think of college
as a pathway to making money.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.546
It's -- it's about
opening your world up,

11:54.548 --> 11:57.649
About allowing yourself
to be astonished and excited

11:57.651 --> 12:00.151
By fascinating new --
um, mom, mom, mom.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.587
This ends with you
being a geologist, remember?

12:02.589 --> 12:03.655
[ chuckles ]

12:03.657 --> 12:05.323
Funny story.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.093
When I first started
at ohio state,

12:08.095 --> 12:10.195
Believe it or not,

12:10.197 --> 12:13.732
I thought I might want
to be a paleontologist.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.602
That's not funny
or a story.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.505
The point is, college is a time
when anything can happen.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.173
Or almost nothing.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.410
Uh, you know, college is one way
to broaden your horizons,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.912
But it may not be the path
for Mandy.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.115
Yeah, as the girl who wrote
all of her high school papers,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.850
I'd have to agree
with that.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.586
Say whatever you want,
but Mandy's finishing college

12:34.588 --> 12:36.554
And, Eve, so help me,
so are you

12:36.556 --> 12:38.456
Or I will make you
into clothes.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.126
What?

12:41.128 --> 12:44.863
It's a threat
your dad made. I...

12:44.865 --> 12:46.831
It sounded better
when <i>he</i> said it.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.206
Hey, dad? Dad?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.108
Come on in, michael.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.044
Hey, what's with the --
what's with all the geezers?

13:00.046 --> 13:02.080
I got a retirement home
three doors down.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.715
I get a lot
of foot traffic.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.617
I'm thinking of putting in
a ramp.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.386
So, gram used to stay home
to bake.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.955
Now she stays home
<i>because</i> she's baked.

13:10.957 --> 13:14.392
So, I guess this is about
the, uh...

13:14.394 --> 13:16.060
Five grand I gave Mandy?

13:16.062 --> 13:18.163
Yeah, dad.
It's way too much money.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.298
Not for me these days,
Mike.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.001
People love their marijuana.
Who knew?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.270
Everybody.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.905
Everybody knew, dad.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.441
Well, I just hope
the fad lasts.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.076
Listen.
We got a problem here

13:32.078 --> 13:34.412
Because I told Mandy
she    <i>couldn</i>quit school.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.614
You give her money
so she <i>can</i> quit school.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.417
I really believe
she's talented, Mike.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.921
I was very impressed
with this fashion show.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.489
You know,
every parent's nightmare

13:44.491 --> 13:47.392
Is that a drug dealer
will corrupt their kid.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.528
Who would have thought
that the drug dealer

13:50.530 --> 13:53.097
Would be
their <i>grandfather?</i>

13:53.099 --> 13:54.999
She's not a kid anymore.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.701
You're trying to control her
with your money.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.436
She's a 19-year-old girl.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.039
What am I supposed to use?
Logic?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.341
Those things never worked
with <i>you</i> when you were 19.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.810
You were bull-headed
and right about everything.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.780
And I still am. And
you're trying to control
<i>my</i> kid with your money

14:08.782 --> 14:10.381
Just like you tried
to control me.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.351
No! I didn't give you money
so you could quit school.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.487
I gave you money so that
you could <i>go</i> to school so you
could become an engineer.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.690
Yeah, so I could work
for <i>your</i> construction
company. Remember that?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.892
We needed an engineer.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.563
We were pretty much
winging the big projects.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.966
Remember when I wanted
to change majors into marketing?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.400
Remember what you told me?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.302
"it's a dead-end job.
You'll end up homeless."

14:31.304 --> 14:34.939
And you did.
Because you kicked me
out of the house.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.677
What's the worst thing
that happens?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.846
Mandy fails
and falls on her ass.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.749
She'll learn more from that
than any college classroom.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.352
How about this?
Let me parent my own kid

14:47.354 --> 14:48.753
And you just
stay out of this.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.824
Better not buy
too much of this stuff.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.259
One of these days,

14:54.261 --> 14:56.194
It'll be your grandkids
clearing out your room.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.039
Oh, um, Blanca, look.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.009
I don't want you to
treat me any differently
now that I'm your boss.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.944
Oh, don't worry,
miss Mandy.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.947
I will smile and shove
all my true feelings inside

15:15.949 --> 15:18.950
Like I do
with all my employers.

15:18.952 --> 15:21.686
Oh, miss Vanessa,
mr. Mike!

15:21.688 --> 15:24.188
How's my favorite couple?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.858
I'm not so good 'cause
I'm looking for my basement.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.626
I used to have it.
It was right in this area.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.395
Have you seen
my basement?
Mandy:
Mm-hmm.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.431
Your basement is now the home
of Mandy Baxter fashions.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.366
Let me give you
the grand tour.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.635
So, this over here
is the photo studio.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.304
This is
the shipping center.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.872
This is just a chair.

15:40.874 --> 15:45.276
And this is Blanca alvarez,
my minority partner.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.579
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.582
Oh, I'm just excited to be in
on the ground floor

15:51.584 --> 15:54.485
Down here
below the...Ground floor.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.954
All right.
Mandy, honey, listen.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.455
We're shutting you down.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.257
Y-you got to give that money
back to grandpa bud.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.558
No,
but I-I can't stop now.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.759
Look at what
I was able to do with it.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.995
Now, so far,
we're only on etsy and ebay,

16:03.997 --> 16:05.930
But I'm setting up
my own website,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.565
Although I've had
a little bit of trouble

16:07.567 --> 16:09.067
Getting the rights
to the name Mandy.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.337
It's owned by some guy
named barry manilow.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.105
Listen, you've done
a good job down here,

16:14.107 --> 16:16.341
But you've got to give
the five grand back to my dad.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.775
I just told you
I don't have it.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.243
I had to pay off
my credit-card debt

16:19.245 --> 16:20.745
And then I had to buy
new materials.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.246
These are all brand-new?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.248
Um, no. I mean, I get them
at discount stores

16:24.250 --> 16:26.517
And then I re-purpose them
into my rompers.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.453
I've got, like,
82 orders to fill.

16:28.455 --> 16:29.921
You have 82 orders?

16:29.923 --> 16:31.422
No. I mean, that --
that's not even possible.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.157
You've only been doing this,
like -- like three days.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.792
It's not possible.
[ tablet beeps ]

16:34.794 --> 16:36.594
Um, you're right.
That number isn't accurate.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.596
She didn't count right.
Let's see.
Now it's 83.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.531
[ beep ]
oh, sorry. 84.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.934
Look, I know that this
sounds crazy to you guys,

16:42.936 --> 16:44.769
But this is
what I was born to do.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.271
This is what I want to do
with the rest of my life.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.942
Honey, listen. You might
think that now, but I --
I mean, honestly,

16:50.944 --> 16:53.711
This reminds me of my flirtation
with paleontology.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.614
I thought that that
was gonna be a good thing.
Let's not go there.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.483
You were trying to make college
sound like a good thing.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.952
Stop. Stop. Stop.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.287
I'm leaving school
to design clothes, okay?

17:05.190 --> 17:07.525
And if that means that I
have to move out to do it
on my own, then I will.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.193
No. Now you're
just being stubborn.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.628
And bull-headed.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.030
And I like it.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.566
You do?
It's pure Baxter.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.136
She might actually
be able to pull this off.
Really?
You think so?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.905
Don't fade on me now.
I like your determination.

17:20.907 --> 17:24.075
Okay, now, listen. I have
never worked so hard on
anything in my entire life --

17:24.077 --> 17:26.677
Even my effortless smile.
Hold on just a second.
Listen to this.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.080
She's got material already.
She's got some orders coming in.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.849
Maybe if she takes off one
semester and she tries this...
Come on.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.684
...Just to get rid
of the stuff she's got.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.155
And you're gonna help her
with her business?
Uh, uh --

17:37.157 --> 17:40.158
Dad, please, please, please?
I'll do anything. I'll even
make you a minority partner.

17:41.827 --> 17:46.197
Better not be coming
out of my end.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.432
You know
what was really smart

17:47.434 --> 17:48.866
Is re-purposing
all this material.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.268
It brings your
capital costs down.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.003
Distribution
can be streamlined very simply.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.504
I just think
it's all about branding.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.672
I love this.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.407
You are already
talking to me

17:56.409 --> 17:58.476
Like I understand
what you're saying.

18:04.016 --> 18:04.949
[ knock on door ]

18:04.951 --> 18:06.317
Mr. B?

18:12.024 --> 18:13.758
You know what?
That's okay.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.561
You just sit there.
I'll get the door. It's okay.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.097
Way ahead of you,
baby.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.299
Hi. Thank you.
Wow.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.701
More overstock
from the outdoor man warehouse.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.370
So, Mandy's making rompers
from old hunting clothes?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.573
Yeah. It's a bunch of stuff
we couldn't unload,

18:28.575 --> 18:31.142
So it was either sell
it to Mandy or give
it to the homeless.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.276
This way, everybody wins.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.613
Except the homeless.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.449
If they could scrape together
the 38 bucks,

18:38.451 --> 18:41.185
No one's stopping them
from buying a romper.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.822
All right. I'll just
take these downstairs.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.391
If someone could get
the basement door for me...

18:49.761 --> 18:52.997
Or I could just
get it.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.232
[ knock on door ]

18:54.234 --> 18:56.234
Geez. You know,
we got a front door!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.769
Hey. I've been out front
knocking for five minutes.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.572
Oh. There's a lot of noise
coming from the basement.

19:01.574 --> 19:05.076
Probably raccoons.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.011
This came to my office
this morning.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.412
You know anything
about it?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.448
From
Mandy Baxter fashions?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.750
That's the first installment
of the loan you gave her.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.352
It wasn't supposed
to be a loan.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.587
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
But, you know,

19:16.589 --> 19:19.590
It teaches her a little bit
of financial responsibility.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.593
She's got to learn she can't
make the check out to "grandpa."

19:25.097 --> 19:27.365
I just wanted
to help her out.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.934
I know you did.
I know --
you know, make up
for not supporting you

19:29.936 --> 19:31.435
Back when you
were in college.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.803
It's all right, dad.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.705
It was good
that I had to pay for college.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.607
It taught me about
being responsible

19:36.609 --> 19:40.144
And how to live
in a six-cylinder gremlin.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.714
I guess I'm just trying
to grow as a person

19:43.716 --> 19:46.017
And a lot of other crap
nobody used to ever have to do

19:46.019 --> 19:48.019
After they hit 60.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.222
Why don't I just pay you back
for the tuition

19:51.224 --> 19:52.790
That I didn't cover
for you?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.392
Dad, we're square.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.860
You've done a lot for me.

19:57.663 --> 19:58.963
Fine.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.234
I just want you to know
I got so much damn money now,

20:03.236 --> 20:05.803
I'm actually looking for things
to throw it away on.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.639
I wonder if romney
will run again.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.477
That would be
throwing it away.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.887
I love that. Just be,
like, super casual.
But then be like...

20:22.889 --> 20:23.854
Just like that.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.523
Vanessa: Mike?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.258
Hey, bud.
Come here.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.393
Come see what Mandy did with
last year's hunting jackets.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.828
Whoa.
Mandy: Yeah.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.463
It looks like you shot
your pants off.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.901
Okay, now, Eve,
give me a look

20:36.903 --> 20:38.869
That says,
"I am owning this romper."

20:38.871 --> 20:40.037
Yes. Yes.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.672
Yes!

20:41.674 --> 20:45.509
Oh, incidentally,
you    <i>c</i>own this romper for $38.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.179
Oh, or two for $100.

20:48.181 --> 20:49.680
You're looking good,
Eve.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.715
Thanks, grandpa.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.183
Um, can I have 5,000 bucks?

20:52.185 --> 20:54.452
Sure.
Dad, dad, dad, dad.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.521
Mike: Evie, make sure
you lock that gun back up.
Okay.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.423
Bet you're real proud
of this kid here.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.425
Oh, we're proud
of all our girls, bud.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.860
Mike: Yeah, she says that
all the time,

21:02.862 --> 21:04.595
But now it actually
may be true.

21:06.365 --> 21:09.600
So, encouraging her
to quit school wasn't so bad.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.569
You know, I have been
thinking about that.
Why can't I do both?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.871
Honey, really? You thinking
about staying in school?

21:13.873 --> 21:16.941
Yeah. I mean, u.C. Denver has
some pretty interesting classes

21:16.943 --> 21:19.310
In marketing
and businessing.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.949
Maybe pick up a class
in englishing.
