WEBVTT

00:04.240 --> 00:05.880
So they're getting theirmoney out of South Africa.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.200
Rich, redneck boys.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.400
Half a million is our cut?

00:09.520 --> 00:11.920
Yeah, your precious
cargo is here.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.240
Are you buying that
into New Zealand.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.200
And what's Lace
got to do with it?

00:15.320 --> 00:17.200
Well he's the one
selling them the land.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.880
Get Nick rowing an RSA.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.560
You're a loathsome
human being.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.520
If we didn't need you for thisjob, you would be fucking gone.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.840
I'll give you Ted Weist.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.320
- Leave him.
- What?

00:26.440 --> 00:27.960
And if he comes afteryou, I'll be there in spades

00:28.080 --> 00:29.520
to defend you.- You need to be somewhere else.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.440
Like where?

00:30.560 --> 00:31.680
No, we need this place.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.560
She saw her opportunity
and she took it.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.000
And we have you
to thank for that.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.160
You betrayed this family.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.160
You were fun.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.280
How did you manage to
cock it up this time?

00:56.280 --> 00:57.520
I told you where the money is.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.880
The office, at the hotel?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.280
Exactly.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.520
So how hard is it tobreak into a bloody hotel?

01:03.640 --> 01:05.320
You do know this thehotel with the Springboks

01:05.440 --> 01:07.000
are staying, right?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.800
How hard is it to break
into the most heavily

01:08.920 --> 01:10.520
guarded place in New Zealand?

01:10.640 --> 01:14.200
Pretty fucking hard.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.680
We're running out
of time here, Dis.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.800
When and where is thisdeal with Mace happening?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.880
My place.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.600
It's the last place I
want any of you guys at.

01:22.720 --> 01:23.880
I might as well have
a sign around my neck

01:24.000 --> 01:25.040
that says I was the
one who set it up.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.520
I have no problem with that.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.280
Hey, these guys
discover it was me,

01:28.400 --> 01:29.200
they'll fucking kill me.

01:34.120 --> 01:34.920
Unless--

01:35.040 --> 01:36.040
Unless what?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.800
The plan was to
meet at my house.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.120
We do the deal, then
we get to The Tist.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.560
So?

01:41.680 --> 01:44.480
So the Yarbees, me, andLace will be at the game.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.040
So?

01:46.160 --> 01:47.800
So, after the deal is done,after the Yarbees have all

01:47.920 --> 01:49.840
had a slice of
Pevlo the paradise,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.560
you'll be stealing from
Evan Lace, not them.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.880
Who's Evan Lace?

01:54.000 --> 01:54.920
Doesn't matter.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.600
Well, it does to me.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.480
Evan Lace isn't
a trained killer.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.720
So, to answer your
question, the money

02:00.840 --> 02:03.200
will be in an unlocked
safe in my home office

02:03.320 --> 02:04.560
while we're at the rugby.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.720
Everyone's a winner.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.760
Except this Lace guy.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.240
Whom we don't give ashit about, do we, Peter?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.440
He'll bounce back.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.080
That's how it always do.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.720
Haven't you done
enough already?

02:17.840 --> 02:19.360
You got what you wanted.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.960
That's not
entirely true, is it?

02:22.080 --> 02:23.320
You called the police yet?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.760
No, he hasn't done
anything except drink.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.240
Does he suspect you?

02:27.360 --> 02:28.680
No, he's still hung up on her.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.720
Then let him,
get out of there.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.040
No, it's too soon.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.720
If I bugger off now,
he'll start wondering.

02:34.840 --> 02:37.440
Especially now you're goingto kick him while he's down.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.120
Nothing personal.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.320
He still got his flesh house,his business, and all of that.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.040
The cockroaches always survive.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.640
So don't you get confusedagain about where

02:47.760 --> 02:50.720
your loyalties lie here.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.200
[music - "watch your back"]

02:52.320 --> 02:53.280
THEME SONG: Watch yourback, watch your back, when

02:53.400 --> 02:55.160
you're walking down the allies.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.560
Child, watch your
back, watch your back.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.960
When you're always cute.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.400
There's a danger on
the street these days.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.320
You can't see it through
the fog and haze.

03:06.440 --> 03:10.840
When everybody's going crazy,everybody's going crazy.

03:10.960 --> 03:14.200
Everybody's going crazy.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.280
This protest movement hasnever been about violence.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.760
Then violence is
what the cops bought.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.000
So the people want tobring it back, bring it on.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.040
If we let these elements
take over on Saturday,

03:28.160 --> 03:29.680
then it was all for nothing.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.840
When you say elements, youmean pissed off people, right?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.720
I mean people that
are looking for a fight.

03:34.840 --> 03:35.920
Well maybe there
are other reasons

03:36.040 --> 03:37.280
they're looking for a fight.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.120
There is racism in this
country too, you know.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.000
And we will continue
to fight then.

03:41.120 --> 03:44.640
Who said that you'll
fight the fight, Dave?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.760
Have you ever thought
maybe you're not

03:46.880 --> 03:49.200
qualified to fight our fight?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.480
I just don't want themessage to be lost, that's all.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.680
Look at you all staunch.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.760
Yeah, that's me, babe.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.760
Just to this
point, can I remind

04:05.880 --> 04:08.280
you that this was your idea?

04:08.400 --> 04:11.280
No, no, you hid me in a cornerand you took advantage of me.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.640
Because you bent
over and lit me.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.000
I'm not a squealer.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.160
Just getting that straight.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.400
Well not at the
moment, you're not,

04:16.520 --> 04:17.720
because you haven't
given me anything.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.280
But when I do, it won't
be squealing, right?

04:19.400 --> 04:21.000
It will be something
that will be mutually

04:21.120 --> 04:22.440
advantageous to us both.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.080
Then fucking be mutuallyadvantageous with me.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
Mike, every bloody
cop in New Zealand

04:26.920 --> 04:28.480
is in Aukland this weekend.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.800
Here is the last place I'dbe if I was pulling a job.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.080
So you're doing a
job somewhere else,

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
is that what you're saying?

04:33.320 --> 04:34.680
All I'm saying,
Mike, is if you

04:34.800 --> 04:38.240
come looking for me thisweekend, you won't find me.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.840
Are we on the same page now?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.000
I'm not sure we're in
the same fucking book.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.360
Yes.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.120
We're buggering off out
of town today, tonight.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.480
But I'm not telling
you where, OK.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.000
Fine.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.360
Try not to get necked whileyou're wherever you are.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.160
Or aren't.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.040
Sucker.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.480
Numbskull.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.480
So, all we need to do isbreak in, get the money,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.080
make it look like we had
to crack the safe, that

05:04.200 --> 05:05.960
gets Dis off the hook.

05:06.080 --> 05:10.080
And then we're out ofthere, a lot, lot richer.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.240
Piece of purse.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.280
Except for the
fact that Dis lives

05:17.400 --> 05:19.080
two blocks from Eden Park.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.640
The nooses is going to
be right on Saturday.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.920
Could work in our
favor, as a distraction.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.640
Distraction with half
the New Zealand police

05:26.760 --> 05:27.880
force patrolling the streets.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.400
And there's the
army, of course.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.280
They'll be here too.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.520
I know how to get pregnant.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.400
Right, I'm off.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.400
Is that so?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.360
It's either the best ideaI've ever had, or the worst.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.360
I can't tell.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.920
Sometimes it is a fine line.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.640
You know Phineas is
shooting blanks, right?

05:59.760 --> 06:02.440
Well, I was just on
the Honolulu, right,

06:02.560 --> 06:07.000
and as I was handing out thepeanuts this guy smiled at me.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.920
And he looked just like Phineas.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.280
Well, close enough.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.120
And then everywhere I
looked there were guys

06:12.240 --> 06:14.040
who could easily
pass for Phineas,

06:14.160 --> 06:15.560
or at least their babies could.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.640
This is definitely
a bad, bad idea.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.640
But it would be so easy.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.040
The guys would get
to tell their mates

06:22.160 --> 06:23.560
about joining the
mile high club,

06:23.680 --> 06:25.640
and sooner or later
I'd get a baby.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.840
Carol, Phineas would find out.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.800
Or, he never does,
and we get to raise

06:29.920 --> 06:31.720
a beautiful child together.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.680
Do you want a gin?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.120
I got it for you duty free.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.680
For once the safe
won't be the problem,

06:36.800 --> 06:38.200
given it will be unlocked.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.480
It's the getting in and
out that's the problem.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.680
Thanks to the
bloody protesters.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.520
The bloody protesters beinghow we're getting in and out.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.200
As far as Ted
and I can make out,

06:48.320 --> 06:50.000
Dis's place is just
outside the zone they're

06:50.120 --> 06:51.520
blocking off around Eden park.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.520
The best way not to benoticed is to look like everyone

06:54.640 --> 06:55.800
who is trying to be noticed.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.520
Why can't we look
like supporters?

06:57.640 --> 06:58.840
Because they'll
be in the ground

06:58.960 --> 07:00.120
while we're doing the job.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.640
Also they're all
wearing helmets.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.160
Too skewed to show their faces.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.720
Well maybe we just
know the cops are

07:04.840 --> 07:06.200
gunning to smash our heads in.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.680
And we take an
appropriate action.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.880
Hang on, you said we.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.840
Our.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.680
That's what you said, right?

07:15.160 --> 07:16.640
Yeah, I did.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.160
I'll be marching.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.480
I've been protesting.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.960
I'm one of them,
and I'm proud of it.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.520
You know that chestprotectors they'll be wearing?

07:22.640 --> 07:24.040
Come on, hit me.

07:24.160 --> 07:24.920
Harder.

07:25.040 --> 07:25.840
My idea.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.840
I made the first one.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.760
All me.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.240
All mine.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.640
And if you've got a problemwith it, then stuff you!

07:30.760 --> 07:31.800
And [inaudible]!

07:36.600 --> 07:38.440
Right.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.960
So if we wanted some
of these chesty things,

07:41.080 --> 07:43.680
and signs and such,
you know, to blend in.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.600
You could get them, then?

07:47.880 --> 07:51.280
Yeah, sure.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
One of the male
attendants I work with,

07:53.520 --> 07:55.560
he's a dead runner for Phineas.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.040
But he likes boys,
which is no good.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.680
- Hello?
- It's me.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.240
You said you were
just about to do it.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.880
You said you'd call when itwas done, and the nothing.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
What's going on?

08:05.120 --> 08:06.760
There were problems.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.760
We shouldn't be talking
about this on the phone.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.560
Where the fuck else amI going to talk about it?

08:10.680 --> 08:13.520
What problems?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.040
She took the bonds.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.000
How the fuck did that happen?

08:17.120 --> 08:18.080
It just did, all right?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.320
It was bad luck.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.680
It just happened.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.880
What about my jewels.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.080
There was nothing.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.000
You promised me.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.280
And I tried.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.480
And now is not the
time to talk about it.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.840
I've got nothing but time.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.280
You made a promise to me.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.960
It didn't turn out
according to plan.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.960
I'll put money aside for me foreverything else that we need.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.600
How can I believe
anything you say?

08:42.720 --> 08:45.640
Because you don't havea fucking choice, Belinda.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.960
What's done is done, I'm sorry.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.240
Come here when you get out.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.440
Oh, I fucking will.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.960
Is she your girlfriend inside?

09:07.280 --> 09:08.520
We were friends, Wolf.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.720
You don't have friends.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.880
OK.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.200
You need to watch your mouth.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.480
Maybe she was your friend.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.200
But what were you to her?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.360
Somebody she could use?

09:18.480 --> 09:20.320
Seriously, you haven't
thought that maybe

09:20.440 --> 09:21.520
she's been playing you?

09:21.640 --> 09:23.760
You know nothing,
you weren't there.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.680
Oh, I'm well aware of thefact that you went to prison,

09:25.800 --> 09:27.440
not me.- That's not what I meant, Wolf.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.600
No, no.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.040
It's cool, I get it.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.800
I defend you, you
go to jail for me.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.520
Whatever we do,
someone else suffers.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.440
What are you doing here?

09:59.560 --> 10:00.400
I came to see you, of course.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.920
Your girls are
at school, right?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.240
You said that at yourplace was the arrangement.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.400
Yeah, that's
partly why I'm here.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.600
I said that is a no go.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.120
It's all hands on
deck at Eden Park.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.560
Smack on the goodcitizens who are standing

10:13.680 --> 10:14.720
up for what they believe in.

10:14.840 --> 10:15.720
A phone call would
have done, Mike.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.920
Is it wrong I want to see you?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
Here, now, yes.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.800
Ngaire, I love you.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.000
And I want to be with
you whenever I can.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.960
But now and here are
not the time and place.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.240
Why not?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.520
Kids are at school,
Lefty's out of town.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.800
He is?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.160
Yeah, they left last night.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.520
Well, why was he
here this morning?

10:33.640 --> 10:35.120
What?

10:35.240 --> 10:36.400
Eating breakfast, saying he'llbe home in time for dinner,

10:36.520 --> 10:38.680
the usual bit of roses.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.200
LEFTY: [inaudible]

10:40.320 --> 10:41.280
[door closes]

10:41.400 --> 10:42.160
Fuck.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.520
Good day, Lefty.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.880
Mr. McCarthy.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.480
Oh, you can call me Mike.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.840
I'm practically family now.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
Can you give us
a moment, love?

11:14.520 --> 11:16.400
I know what's going on here.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.520
Oh, yeah?

11:18.640 --> 11:22.240
And you getting to
me through my wife.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.480
That's not all.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.160
Right.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.520
And how exactly am I gettingto you through Ngaire?

11:28.640 --> 11:32.560
Our deal, McCarthy, was thatI will tell you what I want

11:32.680 --> 11:34.760
to tell you when I want to.

11:34.880 --> 11:40.760
You talk to Ngaire again,you come anywhere near her,

11:40.880 --> 11:42.200
you won't get shit from me.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.080
But shit is all I've gotfrom you so far, Lefty.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.280
Get out of my house.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.320
You're a class
act, Lefty Monroe.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.240
All the way.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.960
Ngaire, come here.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.520
If he so much as looksat you again, you tell me.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.960
Why are you giving
me a hard time?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.520
He's the one who justshowed up out of the blue.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.160
There's stuff going on herethat you don't understand.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.560
You mean like how
you are his pet rat?

12:14.680 --> 12:16.280
You know nothing.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.200
Nothing.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.080
OK?

12:28.760 --> 12:29.520
Hey.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.680
Hi.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.440
What are you doing?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.760
Just getting some gear
for these people I know.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.960
They want to join the march.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.840
Having bad elements likeDavid's going on about?

12:40.960 --> 12:42.320
Yeah, but not like Dave.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.200
I mean.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.120
Last game of the tour.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.680
Yeah.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.960
You want to know the bestthing about this whole thing?

12:54.080 --> 12:55.200
Sure.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.120
Meeting you.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.800
One, two, three, four.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.120
We don't want your racist tour.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.160
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.360
We don't want
your racist tour.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.240
No, no, Phineas.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.960
It has to rhyme.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.000
The charm, it has
to rhyme with eight.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.640
Oh, you mean like gate.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.520
Maybe Phin should stay
quiet at this chanting.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.480
Oh, they'll be chanting.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
I've seen the bloody news.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.800
All they do is chant.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.480
We have to steal the van.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.800
Hey, hit me in the chest.

13:33.920 --> 13:34.720
Go.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.160
Nothing.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.040
These are good.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.520
Actual wages of sin.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.920
More like spoils of hard work.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.800
No, I wasn't complaining.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.800
Don't spend that on stuffyou're just going to burn.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.640
I'll try.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.440
And I don't want to knowwhat you'll spend yours on.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.640
Nothing but wholesome
goodness, I assure you.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.120
Aren't I the one who letthe real money get away.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.120
Doesn't mean you don't geta cut of everything else.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.880
Folse, you need to getover yourself and just take

14:08.000 --> 14:11.520
the bloody money, all right.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.160
Now just because you'vegot money in your pockets,

14:13.280 --> 14:14.960
don't start being dicks.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.360
You want to buy a flower?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.280
I know all about prostitution.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.600
My mother was a prostitute.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.000
OK, don't think
about that when--

14:22.120 --> 14:25.160
Mate, do you want
to buy a flower?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.200
Mike, come on.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.120
I'll take the lot.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.040
Well, Wolfy.

14:41.160 --> 14:41.920
Where did that come from?

14:44.480 --> 14:45.280
This?

14:48.400 --> 14:52.480
You know, I'm not
really a gun person.

14:55.120 --> 14:59.520
I just mainly like
the idea of having it.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
You know?

15:00.760 --> 15:01.520
Just in case.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.240
Was it you?

15:11.360 --> 15:12.440
Was what me?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.040
Were you and her
in on this together?

15:18.760 --> 15:20.120
Still no.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.480
Just like last time you asked.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.560
Yeah, I didn't think so.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.120
She was always the smartestperson in the room.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.560
Yeah, well, sometimes
that's not too hard.

15:37.080 --> 15:37.880
I loved her.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.640
Hey, hey, hey.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.000
What the fuck are you doing?

15:45.120 --> 15:45.960
Unhand me.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.640
Yeah, you got done over.Yeah, that's shit.

15:52.760 --> 15:54.480
But there are people outthere waiting for this moment.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.480
Waiting to kick you
while you're down.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.480
And they will take youfor everything unless you

15:58.600 --> 15:59.400
get your shit together.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.280
OK?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.760
So that's it then.

16:14.880 --> 16:19.480
I'm just meant to stay athome like a good little wifey?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.000
Crikey.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.400
One job of her
own and she thinks

16:22.520 --> 16:23.880
she can get in on everything.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.520
Honey, why are you
looking at me like that?

16:39.640 --> 16:43.360
Well, for starters,because my name isn't Honey.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.760
I don't even know
where I got Honey from,

16:44.880 --> 16:48.520
I just picked a random
name from my brain.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.000
I'm not a good person.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.600
That's the first thingyou need to know about me.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.640
Well, the first real thing,as opposed to everything else

16:55.760 --> 16:57.920
which has been a
bunch of bullshit.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.000
If this is about howyou're good at stealing cars,

17:00.120 --> 17:01.320
I like you.
- No, no, no.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.280
It's kid stuff.Or it was when I was a kid.

17:04.400 --> 17:09.960
This is like, I invented
a whole other person.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.360
Which I did because
someone made me.

17:12.480 --> 17:16.680
And then when I was pretendingto be this other person

17:16.800 --> 17:21.360
I met someone and I
fell in love with her.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.360
But the person in front
of her isn't really me.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.720
So who Is

17:31.840 --> 17:32.880
He's not a good person.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.240
But what's his name?

17:40.720 --> 17:43.480
Burt.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.680
So, tell me all about Burt.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.440
If you need me flip the sign.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.800
You want some breakfast?

18:14.880 --> 18:16.600
Wake up.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.200
Why, is the breakfast on?

18:18.320 --> 18:19.680
Is Wolf here?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.480
He's over there.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.240
Oh, he left.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.120
When?

18:24.240 --> 18:25.040
Oh, not long ago.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.560
Ah, good, we
have things to do.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.720
Where'd you get the suit?

18:34.840 --> 18:36.080
I keep a couple
spare at the office.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.280
You know, I could have
drowned, by the way,

18:37.400 --> 18:38.640
I was staggeringly drunk.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.600
So fire me.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.080
Nah.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.080
'Cause nearly drowning helpme get my shit together.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.080
Also, I need you today.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.320
There's business to be done.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.200
Can it wait?

18:47.320 --> 18:48.520
No, it can't.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.480
I mean yesterday
you were a total mess.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.720
And today I am not.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.920
And this thing needs to be done.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.600
And I need you beside
me when I do it.

18:54.720 --> 18:55.560
Why?

18:55.680 --> 18:56.640
Show of strength in unity.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.560
Come on.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.240
What happened to you?

19:04.360 --> 19:07.000
I've been asking
himself for years.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.320
Hey?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.000
Where were you in the shower?

19:10.120 --> 19:13.640
Usual pre-job send off.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.920
I'm sure you
sorted yourself out.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.520
What the hell is wrong
with you this morning?

19:20.240 --> 19:21.440
Nothing, I'm a
box of fluffies.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.360
Good to know.

19:25.760 --> 19:28.360
I won't be here
when you get home.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.480
Fine.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.480
The girls will
be with my sister

19:30.600 --> 19:32.920
till everything settles down.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.720
When everything what?

19:34.840 --> 19:35.680
I'll be filing for divorce.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600
We'll talk about this after,when you come to your senses.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.520
I've met someone.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.960
He's a good man.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.800
Which is something thatyou will never understand.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.080
Hey.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.840
Also something that you
will never understand.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.400
Why was McCarthy
here the other day?

20:41.320 --> 20:44.160
Jesus, Lefty, today of alldays you choose to be late.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.120
OK.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.480
Let's knock this bastard off.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.920
[pop punk music]

21:05.400 --> 21:08.880
Indeed I hope breakingheads will give us a call.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.640
Or you can fuck off
back to your own country

21:10.760 --> 21:12.280
so we can all get some sleep.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.560
Nice neighborhood
you've got here.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.880
Keep thinking of all
the things I'll miss out

21:30.000 --> 21:32.280
on if Carol can't have kids.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.080
We get split up we
meet back here, OK.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.560
Follow me.

21:35.680 --> 21:40.720
Birthday parties, waterfights, ice cream and stuff.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.000
- Clowns.
- No.

21:43.120 --> 21:43.960
No clowns?

21:44.080 --> 21:44.840
Clowns are evil.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.600
[inaudible] ?

21:49.720 --> 21:54.160
Absolutely, just
everything we stood for.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.360
Just still to this day.

21:58.120 --> 22:03.640
And can I say how amazing it'sbeen to stand alongside you

22:03.760 --> 22:06.040
for this whole thing?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.120
That's really nice, Dave.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.480
Thank you so much.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.400
Honey.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.280
