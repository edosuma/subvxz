00:00.115 --> 00:01.643
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.644 --> 00:03.147
What do I have to do to get you to stay?

00:03.148 --> 00:04.259
I think you're doing it.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.645
Julie, you know this engagement is a trial?

00:06.646 --> 00:07.390
What?

00:07.391 --> 00:09.320
Griffin will not move forward unless you are gone.

00:09.321 --> 00:10.939
He's been taking kickbacks from vendors.

00:10.940 --> 00:12.663
Totally and completely untrue.

00:12.664 --> 00:15.382
You give me your word, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.627
What happened?

00:16.782 --> 00:18.112
I know about Volchok.

00:18.111 --> 00:19.676
What has gotten into you?

00:19.773 --> 00:21.059
You're being so lame.

00:21.058 --> 00:22.182
Not as lame as you.

00:22.183 --> 00:24.404
I'm hoping that you both will apply to Berkeley.

00:24.405 --> 00:25.895
That guy from Brown-- he didn't say

00:25.896 --> 00:28.363
they couldn't take more than one student from Harbor.

00:28.364 --> 00:30.292
- Hey, well, this might be the year.
- That's right.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.563
Cohen, come out. I want to see.

00:38.564 --> 00:39.949
All right.

00:43.738 --> 00:45.532
I feel like Pa Kettle.

00:47.237 --> 00:48.969
Not bad. Try this on.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.729
Oh, wow, you got us matching parkas.

00:50.730 --> 00:53.566
Mm-hmm, and matching hats, and matching scarves.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.796
We're going to be the warmest, most coordinated couple at Brown.

00:56.797 --> 00:58.305
Yeah, you think you're jumping the gun a little bit?

00:58.306 --> 01:00.243
We don't get our acceptance letters until tomorrow.

01:00.244 --> 01:03.392
Oh, please, with your dorked-out grades and my NASA-level SATs,

01:03.393 --> 01:04.873
we are so getting in.

01:04.875 --> 01:07.407
It's Brown. Everyone's got good grades and SATs.

01:07.408 --> 01:11.192
It's very possible that neither of us could get in, or that one of us could.

01:11.193 --> 01:13.683
Uh-huh. And which one of us would that be, Cohen?

01:13.684 --> 01:16.063
It's just as likely you'll get in and I won't.

01:16.349 --> 01:17.565
And you really believe that?

01:17.566 --> 01:19.035
Yeah. And then where would you be?

01:19.036 --> 01:22.468
You'd be stuck in Providence with one half of a his-and-hers parka set.

01:22.469 --> 01:24.661
Yeah, like I'd go if you didn't.

01:24.662 --> 01:25.528
What?

01:25.529 --> 01:28.281
Cohen? Duh? I applied to Brown so we could be together.

01:28.282 --> 01:29.617
I'm not going without you.

01:29.618 --> 01:32.573
Summer, Brown is one of the top universities in the world.

01:32.574 --> 01:34.388
People dream about going there.

01:34.389 --> 01:37.486
No, you dream about going there.

01:37.487 --> 01:40.206
I dream about being with the one I love.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.103
Aww, even all padded up, you still look so scrawny.

01:48.104 --> 01:49.338
I'm going to get some water.

01:49.339 --> 01:51.704
I'm sweating so much I'm getting dehydrated.

01:59.082 --> 02:00.571
I thought you were making me dinner.

02:00.572 --> 02:02.144
- And I did.
- Yeah?

02:02.845 --> 02:04.276
You didn't let me eat it.

02:04.277 --> 02:05.901
No one's stopping you.

02:06.184 --> 02:07.410
Really?

02:07.411 --> 02:09.902
- Okay, in that case...
- No.

02:09.904 --> 02:12.650
Oh, no, no.

02:12.651 --> 02:13.864
What?

02:15.805 --> 02:18.251
So with a 90-day escrow,

02:18.734 --> 02:21.674
that means you'll be in town for...

02:21.675 --> 02:24.863
- 90 more days, Einstein.
- Right.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.371
That makes sense.

02:26.372 --> 02:29.518
Until you get accepted to whatever college you applied to.

02:29.519 --> 02:31.061
Yeah.

02:38.314 --> 02:39.884
Okay.

02:39.885 --> 02:41.787
Should I not have mentioned it?

02:41.788 --> 02:44.188
No, no, it's fine. You're right.

02:44.321 --> 02:46.934
Your letter should be arriving, like, tomorrow, right?

02:46.935 --> 02:48.206
Yeah.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.085
I'm sorry, but I found ignoring the future never makes it go away.

02:54.128 --> 02:56.629
Whatever happens, we'll make it work.

02:59.095 --> 03:03.304
Um, we should eat before the burgers get cold, though. I'll grab some water.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.899
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.405
You want a water?

03:12.406 --> 03:13.921
Sure.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.466
I was just cooling myself off.

03:20.328 --> 03:25.510
All this time I thought getting into college would make everything so much easier.

03:25.511 --> 03:26.819
Yeah.

03:27.637 --> 03:29.233
Not going to happen.

03:31.096 --> 03:33.280
There's a cold front coming through.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074

04:13.951 --> 04:15.309
Pass the milk.

04:16.228 --> 04:18.428
That's cream. I said "milk."

04:20.589 --> 04:22.152
Eating breakfast, are we?

04:22.153 --> 04:23.923
Does this mean we're actually going to school today?

04:23.924 --> 04:26.069
Or do you just need the extra strength for all the small children

04:26.070 --> 04:28.275
you and Volchok plan to mug?

04:28.343 --> 04:31.783
Big day, girls. College letters arriving. Are you excited?

04:31.784 --> 04:33.037
Yeah, delirious.

04:33.038 --> 04:37.066
Don't be nervous, Marissa. You're getting into Berkeley. I feel it in my bones.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.107
I've got to get to school.

04:38.108 --> 04:40.298
Oh,  Marissa, your friend who dropped you off last night,

04:40.299 --> 04:41.963
his motorcycle kind of woke up Neil.

04:41.964 --> 04:43.188
You might want to apologize.

04:43.189 --> 04:47.726
Why? In case Dr. Roberts changes his mind about marrying into our trailer park family?

04:47.727 --> 04:49.436
It's not really my problem.

04:49.437 --> 04:50.844
Marissa...

04:51.701 --> 04:54.674
Well, she's really outdone herself again.

04:54.779 --> 04:57.736
Listen, Summer, how worried do I need to be about her?

04:57.737 --> 04:59.107
I don't know.

04:59.108 --> 05:01.953
She's not exactly confiding in me right now.

05:02.384 --> 05:03.329
Morning, everybody.

05:03.330 --> 05:04.881
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

05:04.903 --> 05:05.874
Feeling lucky?

05:05.875 --> 05:07.617
Um, yes, my aura is green.

05:07.618 --> 05:09.470
Oh, that has to be good.

05:09.699 --> 05:10.973
Where's Marissa?

05:10.974 --> 05:12.938
- She...
- Went to school early

05:12.939 --> 05:15.374
'cause she's nervous with all the college letters and stuff.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.091
Berkeley would be lucky to have her.

05:17.092 --> 05:20.903
And just think, it's just a short motorcycle ride away.

05:38.127 --> 05:40.116
Well, that's a hell of a forehand.

05:40.117 --> 05:42.118
Imagine that connecting with somebody's head.

05:42.119 --> 05:43.915
Hey, Sandy, I didn't know you were coming by.

05:43.916 --> 05:45.088
Yeah, the gate was unlocked.

05:45.089 --> 05:46.874
You should be more conscious of security.

05:46.875 --> 05:50.299
I'm assuming these are somewhat subtle references to what happened to Matt?

05:50.300 --> 05:51.308
I hope he's okay.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.791
Listen, let's just skip to the part where you tell me you had nothing to do with it.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.437
Is he implying that I did?

05:56.448 --> 05:57.921
Matt hasn't said anything.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.230
This is me talking.

05:59.231 --> 06:01.799
I want this hospital built more than anything.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.688
But if you haven't resigned within 48 hours,

06:04.689 --> 06:07.931
I'm going to do everything in my power to take you down.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.843
And  I was lying.

06:10.844 --> 06:13.109
Your forehand sucks.

06:17.075 --> 06:21.184
I-I don't know about that. That just doesn't look right to me.

06:21.185 --> 06:23.717
Oh, you guys. I'm so glad to see you.

06:23.718 --> 06:24.593
Hey, what's up?

06:24.594 --> 06:26.250
Have you spoken to Marissa lately?

06:26.251 --> 06:28.312
Well, if you count "pass the milk," and "don't be so skanky."

06:28.313 --> 06:30.886
Well, I need to talk to her about the college sweatshirt bonfire.

06:30.887 --> 06:32.206
Oh, you guys are coming, right?

06:32.207 --> 06:35.905
Is that the thing where all the seniors wear the sweatshirts of the colleges they're going to?

06:35.906 --> 06:38.375
'Cause that always struck me as incredibly lame.

06:38.376 --> 06:40.604
Oh, and I need your help passing out these fliers.

06:40.605 --> 06:41.975
- I've got to get to class.
- I've got to, too.

06:41.976 --> 06:44.747
I know you guys are just making an excuse to get away from me.

06:44.748 --> 06:46.393
It's okay. It's cute.

06:46.394 --> 06:47.963
Anyway, about Marissa.

06:47.964 --> 06:49.714
Yeah. I wouldn't count on her.

06:49.715 --> 06:52.112
Well, that's great. She's supposed to get the food for the party.

06:52.113 --> 06:55.409
This is so typical. You know, people join Social Committee,

06:55.410 --> 06:58.192
they think it's all fun and games, then who ends up doing the work

06:58.193 --> 07:01.323
when someone decides to go all last-exit-to-Brooklyn, hmm?

07:01.324 --> 07:02.660
Taylor, that's who.

07:02.662 --> 07:05.252
I think she's just going through something right now.

07:05.251 --> 07:06.606
Sung Ho? It's Taylor.

07:06.603 --> 07:10.789
Hi, listen, how much kimchee can you get me by tomorrow night?

07:11.172 --> 07:15.089
You are saving my ass, Sung Ho. You are really saving my ass.

07:18.073 --> 07:20.302
Hey, I'm glad you called.

07:20.303 --> 07:22.668
That's the first time anyone's ever said that.

07:22.935 --> 07:25.082
- What's up?
- Nothing.

07:25.209 --> 07:29.360
Well, college letters are arriving today, and my mom's been pressuring me about it.

07:29.431 --> 07:31.755
And Summer and I are fighting.

07:32.429 --> 07:34.852
So I guess maybe everything.

07:35.372 --> 07:40.618
Well, um, some of the guys are going to party on the beach tonight.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.376
Maybe you should come, you know?

07:42.435 --> 07:44.133
Take the edge off.

07:44.900 --> 07:46.284
Can you pick me up?

07:46.285 --> 07:47.894
I'll be there in a half hour.

07:55.652 --> 07:56.563
Hey, you.

07:56.564 --> 07:58.546
Hey. Thought I'd stop by.

07:58.596 --> 08:00.053
Well, I'm flattered.

08:00.054 --> 08:02.306
Taking time out of your busy day to come see me

08:02.307 --> 08:04.403
when you have a very important letter waiting for you at home.

08:04.404 --> 08:06.315
What can I say? I couldn't help myself.

08:08.218 --> 08:10.073
You know, I could probably tell you if you got in.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.142
- Yeah?
- I could.

08:11.143 --> 08:12.628
I never mentioned I can read palms?

08:12.629 --> 08:13.962
No, it must have slipped your mind.

08:13.963 --> 08:15.684
Must have.

08:19.382 --> 08:20.739
Wow.

08:20.740 --> 08:22.052
You're going to be rich.

08:22.053 --> 08:23.535
Well, that's nice to know.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.506
Oh, whoops, sorry. I read it upside down, so flip that.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.129
Well, easy come...

08:28.130 --> 08:29.355
This is important.

08:29.356 --> 08:33.635
It's a warning against dark-haired beauties who walk into your life.

08:34.219 --> 08:35.551
Really?

08:35.552 --> 08:37.130
Well, what does it say?

08:37.139 --> 08:40.273
It says if you're not very, very careful,

08:40.351 --> 08:42.669
they'll steal your heart.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.565
And in all that, there's... there's nothing about college?

08:54.566 --> 08:56.495
Yeah, yeah, you got in.

09:06.349 --> 09:08.098
All right, I just need to grab a jacket.

09:08.099 --> 09:11.348
Um,  any chance you can get some beer money?

09:11.349 --> 09:12.981
I'm a little short.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.315
Sure. I'll be right back.

10:40.093 --> 10:41.609
Oh, my God!

10:55.096 --> 10:56.601
Oh, my God.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.671
Oh, my God.

11:22.855 --> 11:24.213
Hello?

11:24.286 --> 11:25.654
Summer...?

11:27.522 --> 11:28.544
Hey.

11:28.545 --> 11:29.402
I got in.

11:29.403 --> 11:31.826
What? Yeah! All right!

11:31.827 --> 11:34.034
- Congratulations! That's amazing.
- Thanks! Did you?

11:34.035 --> 11:35.074
- Yeah.
- Really?

11:35.075 --> 11:36.779
- Yeah.
- Oh, congratulations!

11:36.780 --> 11:38.589
- Where's Cohen?
- Uh, I...

11:40.090 --> 11:41.196
Hey.

11:41.340 --> 11:43.272
So, you guys both got in?

11:44.301 --> 11:46.626
Yeah. Are you...?

11:49.628 --> 11:51.614
Oh, my God.

11:56.112 --> 11:59.306
Pack your muffler. We're going to Brown.

11:59.307 --> 12:00.978
- Oh!
- Yeah...

12:02.079 --> 12:04.022
- Oh, man...
- Yeah, yeah.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.959
- That's awesome, dude.
- I'm so happy, too.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.756
Hey, hey, hey...

12:12.693 --> 12:17.358
Hello? Hi. I've been on hold since 5:00 in the morning, so here's my question:

12:17.359 --> 12:20.863
Is there some sort of possibility that a mistake was made?

12:20.864 --> 12:24.465
'Cause, I mean, mistakes can happen, right? Even at Brown.

12:24.466 --> 12:27.143
No, no, I'm not trying to be sarcastic at all.

12:27.144 --> 12:31.296
Let me ask you this: Is there some sort of appeals process or, um...

12:31.297 --> 12:33.060
Next year?!

12:33.867 --> 12:36.766
Lady, my girlfriend is, is, is...

12:37.718 --> 12:39.202
Hello?

12:47.638 --> 12:48.837
S andy?

12:49.912 --> 12:50.812
Oh, hey.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.189
Good morning.

12:53.904 --> 12:57.431
Whatever problems you're thinking about right now, let them go.

12:57.432 --> 13:00.074
Our kids got into college. It's a big day.

13:00.075 --> 13:01.679
You're right.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.142
- We did it.
- We did it.

13:03.143 --> 13:04.177
We did it.

13:04.178 --> 13:06.469
I see the self-congratulation has begun.

13:06.470 --> 13:10.442
Ah! We are so proud of you.

13:10.443 --> 13:12.033
A Cohen in the Ivy Leagues.

13:12.034 --> 13:15.326
You did the work, but I think our genes deserve some of the credit.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.572
- Thanks.
- We knew you could do it.

13:17.573 --> 13:20.818
Oh, hey, there's Ryan. He got into college, too. Give him some hugs.

13:20.819 --> 13:22.518
Oh, congratulations.

13:22.690 --> 13:25.842
Our next-generation Berkeley man. Congratulations.

13:25.843 --> 13:26.677
Thank you.

13:26.678 --> 13:28.736
We are so proud of both of you.

13:28.872 --> 13:31.770
And you know what? We should have a celebration dinner tonight.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.432
- Please invite your ladies.
- Yeah.

13:33.433 --> 13:35.668
I don't know. You think we're making too big a deal though?

13:35.669 --> 13:37.575
Your father's right. 7:30.

13:37.576 --> 13:39.272
Sure, sure, thanks.

13:39.273 --> 13:42.106
No more hugging, though. Physical contact freaks me out.

13:45.744 --> 13:46.988
Feeling better?

13:46.989 --> 13:48.325
Yeah.

13:53.111 --> 13:55.687
Marissa, I don't know where you were last night or what you think you're doing,

13:55.688 --> 13:57.777
but you call me as soon as you get this.

13:57.778 --> 13:59.735
I've had it, young lady.

14:00.865 --> 14:02.632
Oh, Neil, you're up.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.196
Can I get you some coffee?

14:04.197 --> 14:05.567
Yeah.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.305
Summer just left.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.883
She's so excited about Brown.

14:09.884 --> 14:11.757
She wanted to stop by REI on the way to school.

14:11.758 --> 14:14.096
Something about a subzero sleeping bag.

14:14.097 --> 14:16.992
Marissa must have left super early this morning.

14:16.993 --> 14:21.093
I'm worried she didn't get in and maybe is embarrassed to tell me.

14:21.376 --> 14:22.860
She got in.

14:22.977 --> 14:24.235
Excuse me?

14:24.236 --> 14:26.947
I found this in the trash when I got home last night.

14:27.781 --> 14:28.871
Oh, my God.

14:28.872 --> 14:31.631
Julie, we both know she didn't spend the night here.

14:32.154 --> 14:33.474
I don't know what's going on,

14:33.475 --> 14:36.869
but we have to stop pretending that it's not happening.

14:37.371 --> 14:39.098
You've  got to talk to her.

15:23.926 --> 15:25.253
You late for something?

15:25.254 --> 15:26.998
Figured I would make an appearance at Harbor.

15:26.999 --> 15:28.507
It's already fourth period.

15:28.508 --> 15:30.157
Well, what are you doing tomorrow?

15:30.158 --> 15:33.446
My school's having this party thing I have to go to.

15:33.447 --> 15:36.556
All the seniors wear the sweatshirt to the college they got into.

15:36.557 --> 15:39.357
- It's...
- The gayest thing I've ever heard.

15:42.034 --> 15:44.439
So you're really thinking about going to college?

15:44.659 --> 15:46.992
Why? You don't see it?

15:53.027 --> 15:57.192
So, uh, me and some of the guys are going to Baja for the weekend.

15:57.193 --> 16:01.271
You know, surf, smoke some Mexican green.

16:02.225 --> 16:03.590
Want to come?

16:05.166 --> 16:07.824
Or can't you miss your gay sweatshirt party?

16:11.216 --> 16:13.676
Hey. Atwood, have you seen Skeletor?

16:13.677 --> 16:14.341
No, why?

16:14.342 --> 16:17.774
Well, I bought us thermal face masks for Providence, and I want him to try his on.

16:17.775 --> 16:20.611
Oh, why don't you just bring them to dinner tonight?

16:21.801 --> 16:24.194
Sandy, Kirsten, the, uh, celebration thingy.

16:24.195 --> 16:26.204
I'm sure he meant to tell you.

16:26.229 --> 16:30.654
- Oh, well, yeah, probably.
- Probably.

16:30.770 --> 16:34.565
Um, when you see him, will you give him this?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.211
Hey, man.

16:44.396 --> 16:47.519
Um, Summer was looking for you.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.466
I invited her for tonight.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.112
Cool, good.

16:52.568 --> 16:53.914
Everything okay?

16:54.027 --> 16:58.934
Yeah, no. Just, uh, if she sees me, she'll dress me like a Timberland Barbie.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.192
Did you invite Sadie?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.114
Uh, I'm going over to her place after school.

17:02.115 --> 17:03.325
Did you tell her you got into Berkeley?

17:03.326 --> 17:05.634
No, no. That's kind of difficult, you know?

17:05.635 --> 17:07.031
I mean, we haven't really been going out that long,

17:07.032 --> 17:09.923
but what do you do when only one of you is going to college?

17:09.924 --> 17:13.169
Oh, man, I wish I knew.

17:22.335 --> 17:23.796
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.316
Perfect timing.

17:25.701 --> 17:27.526
I just finished working.

17:28.090 --> 17:31.139
So? Congratulations.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.827
Psychic, remember?

17:33.473 --> 17:35.128
And when you didn't call last night...

17:35.129 --> 17:37.342
Yeah, well, uh...

17:38.090 --> 17:39.300
Yeah.

17:41.052 --> 17:42.653
I'm happy for you.

17:42.654 --> 17:43.936
Thank you.

17:48.748 --> 17:52.440
So you want to mention the elephant in the room or should I?

17:53.236 --> 17:55.706
So I've been thinking, I don't have to go up till August.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.651
Could have the summer.

17:56.652 --> 18:00.716
Hmm, yeah, not so into relationships with an egg timer on them.

18:01.834 --> 18:04.438
Sadie, the last few months...

18:04.439 --> 18:06.652
Okay, Ryan, pet peeve:

18:06.665 --> 18:09.526
Having a guy tell me how amazing I am while dumping me.

18:09.527 --> 18:10.639
Rings kind of false, you know?

18:10.640 --> 18:15.182
I was gonna say that I've been happier than I've ever been with anyone I've dated.

18:25.079 --> 18:27.652
I'm still in Newport because of you.

18:29.755 --> 18:32.648
Making jewelry, very portable business.

18:32.649 --> 18:34.424
You see where I'm going with this?

18:35.121 --> 18:37.293
You would move to Berkeley?

18:37.299 --> 18:38.880
Yeah, I would...

18:39.023 --> 18:41.058
if you want me to.

18:51.229 --> 18:52.653
Yeah, I do.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.656
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cohen.

19:02.154 --> 19:03.836
Well, hello, Summer.

19:03.837 --> 19:05.002
Hi, Summer.

19:05.003 --> 19:06.471
My dad just dropped me off.

19:06.472 --> 19:08.078
Hey, is dinner ready?

19:08.079 --> 19:09.491
Oh, my God.

19:09.492 --> 19:13.809
Get used to it, Cohen, 'cause this is what you're gonna be looking at for the next four years.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.451
Hey, we're not late, are we?

19:15.452 --> 19:17.131
Not at all. We're glad you're here.

19:17.132 --> 19:19.623
Now, everybody, outside. Dinner is served.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.455
All right.

19:23.374 --> 19:26.665
So Ryan told me that you guys actually went to Berkeley.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.418
Yes.

19:27.419 --> 19:29.503
Please don't have them tell the Halloween story again.

19:29.504 --> 19:32.514
Let's just say we met under unusual circumstances.

19:32.515 --> 19:34.943
It's a beautiful place; you should try and visit.

19:36.269 --> 19:39.478
Uh, well, actually, Sadie's going to be coming up to Berkeley with me.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.411
When  you go up to look at the school?

19:41.422 --> 19:43.489
- No, to live.
- What?

19:43.490 --> 19:46.054
I don't understand. Did you apply to Berkeley?

19:46.055 --> 19:49.470
No, no. It's just my business can kind of go anywhere,

19:49.471 --> 19:54.229
and Ryan's going to be up there, so we figured, why not?

19:54.373 --> 19:57.672
So uh, when did you decide this?

19:57.673 --> 19:59.103
This afternoon.

19:59.104 --> 20:00.637
It was my suggestion.

20:00.638 --> 20:02.926
Uh, no, actually, I think I asked you.

20:08.235 --> 20:09.742
Well, I think it's great.

20:09.743 --> 20:13.609
I mean, finding the right person, and then deciding to be with them no matter what.

20:13.610 --> 20:15.703
That's what life's about, right?

20:23.007 --> 20:25.203
- You know, I'm actually kind of tired.
- Sadie.

20:25.204 --> 20:26.973
- I'm gonna go home.
- No, no, no.

20:26.974 --> 20:28.530
Thank you both very much for dinner.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.173
- Oh, wait...
- I'll walk you out.

20:40.711 --> 20:43.611
You've been, like, so quiet tonight. Is anything wrong?

20:43.650 --> 20:44.939
No, I'm fine.

20:44.940 --> 20:48.196
I still can't believe that Ryan and Sadie are moving to Berkeley together.

20:48.197 --> 20:49.723
I think that is so romantic.

20:49.724 --> 20:51.353
I don't know what Ryan's thinking.

20:51.354 --> 20:52.589
What are you talking about?

20:52.590 --> 20:54.983
He's 18. I just think college should come first.

20:54.984 --> 20:58.504
Not if you're with the one you think you should be with, like, forever be with.

20:58.505 --> 21:00.645
Yeah, who really knows that at 18?

21:00.646 --> 21:02.084
I do.

21:06.552 --> 21:08.161
Oh, my God.

21:08.704 --> 21:10.149
You don't.

21:10.150 --> 21:11.448
Summer, it's not...

21:11.449 --> 21:13.711
No, you know what? I have to go.

21:29.296 --> 21:32.020
If you're here about the sweatshirt party, I'm not going,

21:32.021 --> 21:34.537
so if you want to yell, yell.

21:34.538 --> 21:38.150
Actually, I was hoping that we could just talk.

21:40.398 --> 21:42.636
Marissa, I don't know what's going on with you,

21:42.637 --> 21:44.440
or what I did wrong,

21:44.441 --> 21:47.516
although I'm sure we could come up with a few things, but

21:47.607 --> 21:51.148
I just can't bear to see you doing this to yourself.

21:51.149 --> 21:53.766
Mom, this isn't about you.

21:54.115 --> 21:59.249
I just keep trying to picture myself at Berkeley, and I can't.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.476
That, that just means you're scared, honey, and that's fine.

22:02.477 --> 22:05.514
Look, Marissa, I've been in that place before

22:05.515 --> 22:07.795
where you lose faith in yourself.

22:07.814 --> 22:11.883
But honey, I believe in you and you deserve this.

22:12.352 --> 22:14.303
I don't know, Mom.

22:14.806 --> 22:17.783
Marissa, please don't give up on yourself.

22:17.999 --> 22:21.235
You have no idea how much I want this for you.

22:23.421 --> 22:25.983
I-I'll think about it.

22:26.873 --> 22:28.433
That's all I want.

22:42.866 --> 22:44.201
Hey.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.851
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.

22:48.707 --> 22:50.247
Did you talk to the parents yet?

22:50.248 --> 22:53.805
You know what? In hindsight, breaking the Sadie news to them that way?

22:53.806 --> 22:55.375
Probably not a very good plan.

22:55.376 --> 22:58.685
Well, at least my dad didn't have an actual heart attack at the table,

22:58.863 --> 23:00.141
so that's a plus.

23:00.142 --> 23:02.092
That's true. Anything happen after I left?

23:02.093 --> 23:04.809
Summer and I got into a soul-crushing fight about Brown.

23:04.810 --> 23:07.373
Hmm, I'm sorry. Have you talked to her?

23:07.374 --> 23:12.680
No. But even if I did, man, and she forgave me, it's like then what? You know?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.047
I don't know. It's complicated.

23:16.189 --> 23:19.304
Seth, um, I got to ask.

23:19.721 --> 23:21.789
Did you really get into Brown?

23:21.790 --> 23:24.970
Did I get in...? Ryan, now who's smoking pot?

23:24.971 --> 23:29.442
Listen to me. The only class I've ever gotten less than an "A" in was gym.

23:29.443 --> 23:33.598
My essay on "The Loneliness of Being Superman" made Mrs. Rushfield cry,

23:33.599 --> 23:37.627
so you know, of course... Oh, God, how did I not get in?

23:42.355 --> 23:44.207
Why are you lying about it?

23:44.242 --> 23:45.340
For Summer.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.890
Well, don't you think she's going to notice when you're not there first semester?

23:47.891 --> 23:51.165
She said if I didn't get in and she did she wouldn't go to Brown.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.917
I'm not going to let her do that.

23:52.918 --> 23:54.568
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

23:54.569 --> 23:56.396
Well, I think that's up to her.

23:56.817 --> 23:59.586
Sorry, man, I think you got to tell her the truth.

24:12.714 --> 24:14.427
Hey, sorry I'm late.

24:14.734 --> 24:17.539
No, it's fine. I just got here myself.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.133
So, uh, Harbor's having this party tonight.

24:20.134 --> 24:23.296
Everyone wears their college sweatshirt if you want to go.

24:23.297 --> 24:26.148
Sure. Yeah, that'd be fun.

24:26.149 --> 24:28.184
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.022
And I'm sorry about last night.

24:31.023 --> 24:33.302
Uh, that was not the way it should have happened.

24:33.303 --> 24:35.153
Or maybe it was.

24:35.154 --> 24:36.028
What do you mean?

24:36.029 --> 24:39.086
Come on, Ryan. In the heat of the moment we decide to go to Berkeley together?

24:39.087 --> 24:40.556
Maybe we need to think about it.

24:40.557 --> 24:41.841
You saying you don't want to anymore?

24:41.842 --> 24:44.205
We should just make sure that we're doing this for the right reasons.

24:44.206 --> 24:47.227
Well, we are because we want to stay together.

24:48.036 --> 24:49.227
Right?

24:50.527 --> 24:54.102
I guess I just feel like a lot of people go to college to find themselves,

24:54.103 --> 24:56.445
and maybe you're one of those people.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.937
You know, I wouldn't want to get in the way of that.

25:02.584 --> 25:07.761
I feel more myself with you than anyone.

25:09.577 --> 25:11.992
Those are some pretty big words, mister.

25:13.422 --> 25:15.503
Well, I am going to Berkeley.

25:35.488 --> 25:38.292
Sung Ho, you dog.

25:38.293 --> 25:41.722
Oh, let me give you my credit card.

25:43.764 --> 25:47.581
Summer, come on, cheer up. It's going to be fine.

25:47.582 --> 25:49.084
You and Seth will work it out.

25:49.085 --> 25:50.777
I know, I just don't get it.

25:50.778 --> 25:52.731
We had a dream. The dream comes true,

25:52.732 --> 25:54.896
and then suddenly, he's like, "God, what a crappy dream."

25:54.897 --> 25:55.972
I mean, who does that?

25:55.973 --> 25:59.142
Summer, getting a man is like capturing

25:59.143 --> 26:02.542
a wily silverback gorilla in the Ugandan Highlands.

26:02.543 --> 26:06.396
You see, nature is telling that gorilla to stay in the wild.

26:06.397 --> 26:09.418
But both you and I know that that gorilla would be much happier

26:09.419 --> 26:11.961
back in the zoo on a normal feeding schedule.

26:11.962 --> 26:15.338
But sometimes he's just got to roar and beat his chest

26:15.339 --> 26:18.087
before he'll let you shoot him with a tranq dart.

26:18.128 --> 26:22.713
So what you're saying is he's trying to exert his gorilla independence?

26:22.714 --> 26:25.907
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying, Summer.

26:25.908 --> 26:27.606
Now come help me set up the bonfire.

26:27.607 --> 26:29.118
Uh, Sung Ho...

26:31.806 --> 26:32.959
Yeah, what she said.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.231
Oh, bye, guys.

26:38.575 --> 26:40.071
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:40.072 --> 26:41.023
Got a sec?

26:41.024 --> 26:43.743
Uh, yeah, I was just about to head over to the bonfire.

26:43.744 --> 26:45.643
I found this in the closet.

26:45.644 --> 26:47.111
It's a little worn, but...

26:47.112 --> 26:49.219
Wow. Wow, that's great. Thanks.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.058
Kirsten was wondering if maybe Sadie could use this.

26:54.317 --> 26:56.184
Sorry about last night.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.427
You know, we both think she's a great girl.

26:58.428 --> 27:00.140
She is. She is.

27:00.141 --> 27:05.000
And, uh, I know it seems kind of fast, but I really care about her.

27:05.001 --> 27:06.768
I'm sure you do.

27:07.289 --> 27:09.292
You know, it's funny, just before you sprung your news

27:09.293 --> 27:12.573
I was about to tell you that I'd spoken to my friend Paul Glass up at Berkeley,

27:12.574 --> 27:15.607
and he told me that he could probably get you into my old dorm.

27:15.608 --> 27:17.214
Of course if you're living with Sadie,

27:17.215 --> 27:19.310
you're going to have to find some off-campus housing.

27:19.311 --> 27:21.029
She's not going to be part of the meal plan.

27:21.030 --> 27:25.464
So between food and rent, I think you're both going to have to have jobs.

27:25.465 --> 27:28.118
Kirsten and I were going to cover your costs,

27:28.179 --> 27:29.525
but now with Sadie in the mix...

27:29.526 --> 27:31.410
No, no, I would never ask that.

27:33.408 --> 27:37.024
I guess we just haven't had time to really figure everything out.

27:37.025 --> 27:39.792
No, of course not, of course not. How could you?

27:40.453 --> 27:43.560
It all happened so fast.

27:48.052 --> 27:50.820
Did I ever tell you how I almost didn't make it to Berkeley?

27:50.821 --> 27:53.532
I was driving across the country that first summer.

27:53.533 --> 27:57.871
I spent the night in this little town a thousand miles from home

27:57.912 --> 28:00.143
and I was terrified.

28:03.825 --> 28:06.910
Sandy, I'm not doing this with Sadie because I'm scared.

28:06.911 --> 28:08.297
Okay.

28:21.458 --> 28:22.576
Hey.

28:22.577 --> 28:23.700
Where are you?

28:23.701 --> 28:24.921
I'm ready to go.

28:24.922 --> 28:27.139
I can't go to Baja tonight.

28:27.881 --> 28:29.095
All right.

28:29.096 --> 28:31.100
But call me when you get back.

28:31.101 --> 28:32.741
Yeah, sure, whatever.

28:53.213 --> 28:54.634
Sadie?

28:55.202 --> 28:58.161
Ryan, I'm so glad you're here. I have something huge to tell you.

28:58.162 --> 28:59.263
Yeah, so do I.

28:59.264 --> 29:00.879
Oh, okay. You want to go first?

29:00.880 --> 29:02.742
No, no, no, that's fine. Go ahead.

29:02.743 --> 29:05.421
Okay, so I called the guy who sells my jewelry in the Bay area

29:05.422 --> 29:08.745
and it turns out he runs an artist's co-op in Berkeley.

29:10.085 --> 29:11.906
So I could live there.

29:11.998 --> 29:15.448
Or we could live there, together. Isn't that awesome?

29:15.449 --> 29:17.405
Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

29:17.863 --> 29:20.076
See? I told you I was psychic.

29:21.547 --> 29:23.443
Okay, what was your news?

29:27.782 --> 29:29.728
Uh, I talked to Sandy.

29:30.356 --> 29:32.562
He and Kirsten are fine about us.

29:33.175 --> 29:34.731
That's awesome.

29:37.544 --> 29:40.002
Okay. We've got to leave for your party, right?

29:40.003 --> 29:41.112
Yeah.

29:41.884 --> 29:45.081
Hey, do you think it's going to be weird that I'm not wearing a sweatshirt?

29:45.750 --> 29:48.638
No, no, you'll be fine.

29:49.693 --> 29:51.602
Okay. Let me go grab my purse.

29:51.603 --> 29:52.742
All right.

30:09.530 --> 30:10.789
Summer?

30:49.537 --> 30:50.728
Hey.

30:50.919 --> 30:52.968
Hey. Where have you been?

30:52.969 --> 30:56.219
Oh, I had to help Taylor set up for the bonfire.

30:56.633 --> 30:59.034
That girl can handle a chainsaw.

31:01.132 --> 31:03.502
Hey, Seth hasn't called, has he?

31:03.503 --> 31:05.472
No, I don't think so.

31:09.042 --> 31:11.259
Is everything okay with you guys?

31:12.580 --> 31:14.130
Don't worry about it.

31:14.131 --> 31:19.057
Look, Summer, I'm sorry about the way I've been acting.

31:19.097 --> 31:21.032
Just give me a chance.

31:25.957 --> 31:30.128
Remember when the boys made us watch that movie about the gay guys on the mountain?

31:30.129 --> 31:31.724
- Lord of the Rings?
- Yeah.

31:31.725 --> 31:34.671
And remember that Gollum guy-- how he got evil

31:34.672 --> 31:37.967
and more evil the closer he got to that fiery thing?

31:38.006 --> 31:40.121
That's kind of how Seth is about Brown.

31:41.782 --> 31:44.781
Hey, you guys will work it out. You love each other.

31:45.535 --> 31:46.811
Thanks.

31:48.704 --> 31:53.423
So no offense, but what has been going on with you?

31:54.347 --> 31:56.015
I don't know.

31:56.017 --> 32:00.551
I keep trying to get back to the life I remember, but I just... I can't.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.330
It never seems to work.

32:05.660 --> 32:07.993
And you couldn't talk to me about this?

32:07.994 --> 32:11.340
I've been your best friend since the first grade.

32:11.510 --> 32:13.232
I know.

32:14.636 --> 32:15.971
I'm sorry.

32:18.810 --> 32:20.482
I forgive you.

32:22.848 --> 32:26.350
But you have to come with me to the sweatshirt party as penance.

32:26.351 --> 32:29.673
Oh, I would, but I don't have a sweatshirt.

32:29.674 --> 32:33.424
Oh, yeah, what are we going to do about that?

32:41.536 --> 32:44.107
I bought this a few months ago.

32:44.108 --> 32:46.832
It looks like somebody believed in you.

32:51.468 --> 32:52.641
Hey.

32:59.652 --> 33:00.867
You okay?

33:01.361 --> 33:04.117
Please, I just... I can't do this right now.

33:04.118 --> 33:04.714
Do what?

33:04.715 --> 33:07.021
Sit here and be tested as wife-mother material

33:07.022 --> 33:08.854
while I'm worried about my daughter's future.

33:08.855 --> 33:12.587
I get it, okay? It's not what you expected. I failed. Fine.

33:12.588 --> 33:15.049
But right now, I need to think about Marissa.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.855
Julie, I'm sorry if I...

33:18.994 --> 33:21.890
If I made you feel like you were being tested. I'm...

33:23.977 --> 33:25.518
I was wrong.

33:25.948 --> 33:29.874
And you've hardly failed. I think Marissa's very lucky to have you for a mom.

33:31.305 --> 33:33.876
Hey, guys, we're going to the party.

33:33.877 --> 33:36.252
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dr. Roberts.

33:37.946 --> 33:39.349
What did I tell you?

33:52.948 --> 33:53.903
Hey.

33:53.904 --> 33:55.375
Hey, guys.

33:55.376 --> 33:56.372
Congratulations.

33:56.373 --> 33:58.149
Yeah, you, too. Hi, Sadie.

33:58.150 --> 33:59.386
Hey.

33:59.752 --> 34:01.873
Um, has anyone seen Cohen?

34:01.874 --> 34:03.735
Someone say my name?

34:04.119 --> 34:05.396
Hey.

34:06.227 --> 34:08.478
You're not wearing your sweatshirt.

34:08.688 --> 34:11.416
You guys are all here! The core four!

34:11.417 --> 34:13.279
I need a picture. Go!

34:14.949 --> 34:18.058
- Sorry, do you mind?
- No, no, it's fine.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.399
Everybody say "higher earning potential."

34:25.331 --> 34:26.889
So cute.

34:28.773 --> 34:30.101
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:30.103 --> 34:31.449
Yeah.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.599
I'm actually kind of hungry. Do you want anything?

34:34.600 --> 34:35.279
No, no.

34:35.280 --> 34:36.913
I will show you where the food is.

34:36.914 --> 34:40.645
Hi, I'm Taylor. I used to be, like, total enemies with those guys,

34:40.646 --> 34:43.510
but I'm pretty much second-circle core now.

34:45.914 --> 34:47.315
I like your sweatshirt.

34:47.315 --> 34:49.766
Thanks. Yours isn't so bad, either.

34:55.047 --> 34:56.908
You, uh, you doing okay?

35:01.847 --> 35:04.383
Well, besides this thing choking me...

35:04.492 --> 35:08.094
No, you know, honestly, I'm beginning to think all of this is a bad idea.

35:08.095 --> 35:09.404
What's that?

35:09.405 --> 35:12.094
The sweatshirt, the party.

35:14.843 --> 35:17.307
You know, even though we're not together, um...

35:18.570 --> 35:21.323
I'm here if you ever want to talk.

35:23.624 --> 35:24.905
Thanks.

35:26.404 --> 35:27.907
It means a lot.

35:40.789 --> 35:44.384
So this is my friend Sung Ho. And this is Sadie.

36:00.085 --> 36:02.345
You could have told me your answer on the phone.

36:02.585 --> 36:04.435
Well, I wanted us to talk.

36:04.436 --> 36:06.399
So you're not pulling out?

36:06.400 --> 36:09.856
Fine. My friends at the DA's office are going to find whoever attacked Matt,

36:09.857 --> 36:11.763
and I can promise you they're not gonna keep it quiet.

36:11.764 --> 36:14.456
Look, I had nothing to do with what happened to Matt.

36:14.457 --> 36:16.990
Unfortunately, I can't offer you anything but my word.

36:16.991 --> 36:18.783
Which doesn't carry a lot weight with me.

36:18.784 --> 36:20.914
How about $700 million?

36:20.915 --> 36:21.817
Excuse me?

36:21.818 --> 36:26.230
With the hospital going up, the city is interested in revitalizing the entire area:

36:26.231 --> 36:28.912
parks, affordable housing, restaurants.

36:28.913 --> 36:31.919
Head of the appropriations committee is a friend of mine.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.215
He's asked about your firm.

36:34.216 --> 36:35.691
Wow.

36:38.026 --> 36:39.814
So now you're trying to bribe me.

36:39.815 --> 36:42.216
The face of this city is changing, Sandy.

36:42.217 --> 36:44.253
You can be a part of that.

36:47.630 --> 36:50.316
Oh, my God. What... come inside.

36:50.317 --> 36:52.143
No, that's all right. Is Sandy here?

36:52.144 --> 36:54.997
No, no, he's out. What happened to you?

36:54.998 --> 36:56.781
Some guys broke into my apartment.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.512
Listen, tell him I stepped by with the proposal.

36:58.513 --> 37:01.726
No, no, Matt, wait. Wait. Wait. Did you call the police?

37:01.727 --> 37:03.607
They have to find out who did this.

37:03.608 --> 37:04.807
I know who did it.

37:04.808 --> 37:06.845
What are you talking about?

37:07.339 --> 37:10.071
Look, I really like Sandy,

37:10.072 --> 37:13.334
but you've just got to... you got to get him to quit this

37:13.335 --> 37:15.449
because pretty soon, it's going to be too late.

37:24.468 --> 37:26.512
So are you going to talk or what?

37:26.513 --> 37:27.893
Yeah.

37:28.299 --> 37:30.943
It's just not easy.

37:32.023 --> 37:33.794
Then I'll go.

37:35.274 --> 37:37.204
Look, I get that you're a guy, okay?

37:37.205 --> 37:39.665
And I know you have that whole simian brain thing,

37:39.666 --> 37:43.070
but if we're going to go to college together next year,

37:43.071 --> 37:45.590
you can't keep freaking out on me all the time.

37:45.591 --> 37:47.536
Yeah, Summer, that's just it.

37:47.537 --> 37:48.966
What is?

37:49.951 --> 37:53.153
I'm not sure that I want to go to Brown next year.

37:53.154 --> 37:54.261
What?

37:54.262 --> 37:56.289
I've just been thinking a lot about it, and I'm not...

37:56.290 --> 37:58.923
I'm not exactly sure that Brown is the right choice for me.

37:58.924 --> 38:00.593
For you, I still, I think it's great.

38:00.594 --> 38:03.216
We applied to Brown so that we could be together.

38:03.217 --> 38:04.349
Yeah, I know.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.011
I guess I changed my mind.

38:06.012 --> 38:08.221
So what, we just suddenly apply somewhere else?

38:08.222 --> 38:10.784
No, I think you should still go to Brown.

38:10.785 --> 38:12.116
You should.

38:12.117 --> 38:14.047
I'll just go somewhere else.

38:15.768 --> 38:17.698
Do you really mean this?

38:23.639 --> 38:26.351
I'm sorry. I think it's for the best.

38:33.482 --> 38:35.010
Okay.

38:38.547 --> 38:42.564
Well, I guess, um, if this is how you feel, fine.

38:45.494 --> 38:46.732
We're over.

38:58.093 --> 39:00.417
Hey, I've been looking for you.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.970
Yeah, Taylor went off with that food guy.

39:04.455 --> 39:07.538
I'm pretty sure they were talking dirty to each other in Korean.

39:07.539 --> 39:09.010
You want to leave?

39:09.085 --> 39:11.964
I know it's kind of hard on you not knowing anyone.

39:13.757 --> 39:15.907
You're a nice guy, Ryan,

39:17.292 --> 39:19.775
but I'm not coming to Berkeley with you.

39:30.325 --> 39:33.586
Don't you see this is what it'll be like next year?

39:35.151 --> 39:39.231
You'll have this other world, and I'll constantly be pulling you away from it.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.788
You won't get to experience college the way you should.

39:44.754 --> 39:46.592
I'm not going to do that to you.

39:46.593 --> 39:47.833
Come on.

39:47.834 --> 39:49.543
You know I'm right.

39:59.161 --> 40:00.706
I'm going to go home.

40:02.553 --> 40:04.462
I have to start packing in the morning.

40:04.463 --> 40:05.740
I'll drive you.

40:05.741 --> 40:07.269
I want to walk.

40:10.051 --> 40:12.249
I'd rather say good-bye here.

40:18.828 --> 40:20.716
Keep in touch, Ryan.

40:21.464 --> 40:23.056
I'm going to miss you.

40:47.801 --> 40:48.992
Sandy.

40:52.412 --> 40:54.485
What are you doing sitting in the dark?

40:55.763 --> 40:57.476
Matt came by.

40:57.477 --> 40:59.007
What did he say? Because you know...

40:59.008 --> 41:01.465
Just promise me that you're going to quit this thing.

41:01.466 --> 41:03.008
Oh, honey...

41:03.408 --> 41:05.258
- it's complicated.
- No, it's not.

41:05.259 --> 41:07.398
Well, it's about more than just the hospital.

41:07.399 --> 41:11.749
Do you forget that I worked at that company for 15 years,

41:11.750 --> 41:13.557
and I saw what happened to my father?

41:13.558 --> 41:15.871
I'm not going to become your father...

41:15.872 --> 41:18.148
but I can't just quit.

43:01.094 --> 43:05.014
