01:35.428 --> 01:37.308
We used to come out here
every summer.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.353
And after they died,
I thought about coming back.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.900
Because I knew no one would ever
find a body out here.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.364
I could just... disappear.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.827
You never told me.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.705
Well, I never did it.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.336
So we just dumped a body
at your childhood vacation spot.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.715
Not much of a vacation.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.427
Two bickering siblings forced
to share a queen bed

02:16.511 --> 02:18.805
just because it's half a block
from some water.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.391
Sounds fun.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.315
We're the only ones
who even know Simpson's gone.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.610
He didn't have any family.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.990
Well, IGH does have a type.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.079
I'm sorry about what happened to him.
And more than that, I'm pissed.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.875
But I can't hunt down IGH
from a jail cell.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.543
I know.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.387
And that's exactly where I'd be
if the cops find me with another body.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.299
He'd understand. It just sucks.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.135
We gotta wipe down his car
and ditch it.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.150
You know, it's not even registered to him.
He probably stole it.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.957
Simpson was serious
about this protection thing.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.668
It's an arsenal.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.673
Yeah. He knew what he was facing.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.760
Hey. No. I'll keep 'em.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.844
What?

03:39.928 --> 03:42.764
I know what we're facing, too,
and I need all the defense I can get.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.393
Well...

03:48.436 --> 03:50.563
time to go claw some memories
out of my brain.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.690
How?

03:52.774 --> 03:55.735
I gotta go through every file
you have on IGH.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.862
It's gonna be hard to look at.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.657
Yeah. Well, my past is killing people now,
so not a lot of options.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.533
I might have one.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.161
Does it involve alcohol?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.081
Another deep breath.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.999
In through the nose...

04:11.251 --> 04:13.294
and out through the mouth.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.882
You're feeling more and more at peace
with every breath.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.386
Can I get another pillow?

04:22.011 --> 04:23.596
You have seven pillows.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.515
I know this is hard,

04:25.598 --> 04:28.518
but when you resist suggestion,

04:28.601 --> 04:30.603
the hypnotic state is difficult
to achieve.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.815
I just don't have a great track record
with shrinks.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.025
We're not shrinking. We're expanding.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.153
Okay, let's return to our breathing.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.863
And in...

04:40.947 --> 04:44.867
And as you exhale,
I want you to imagine a safe place.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.413
Somewhere peaceful, calming.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.582
In your safe place, there is a door.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.793
Picture that door.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.045
Move toward it.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.132
Now, open that door.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.094
Open it and move toward your memories.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.098
I don't have a safe place.

05:07.181 --> 05:10.601
Patients often
choose a stretch of beach.

05:10.685 --> 05:12.937
- Yeah, no.
- Or their childhood home.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.065
- Uh-uh.
- All right. Where do you go to relax?

05:16.733 --> 05:21.612
Rudy's. 9th and 45th.
Solid pours and they got free hot dogs.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.990
Jess, just tell him
what you already remembered.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.286
She had this memory of a thing,
a creature, with a meat face.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.998
It wasn't a memory.
Meat-faced creatures don't exist.

05:32.081 --> 05:37.920
Well, even if your mind invented it,
it could help unlock a door.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.716
Start at the beginning.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.886
Dr. Tiboldt, I'm so sorry.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.645
Jess, you said you were willing to try.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.649
To remember, yeah. Not to work out
my crap with some pseudo shrink.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.487
You know, whatever works for you.
Just tell me how I can help.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.072
Go through the rest of your fan mail.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.241
Maybe Whizzer wasn't the only one trying
to reach out.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.915
- You found her, then.
- I forgot to call.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.416
Yeah, your follow-through blows.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.086
The station said you called in sick.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.629
I'm sorry.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.255
Did you get it?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.216
The bloody story. Did you get it?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.759
Jess, maybe you should go.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.512
Aren't relationships great?

06:36.729 --> 06:39.357
I'm aware of the time,
they're just gonna have to wait.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.473
Do you not trust me
to find my way to the conference room?

06:43.528 --> 06:47.323
No. We thought it best to limit
today's meeting to name partners only.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.659
So we came to you.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.834
You look well, Jeri.

07:00.670 --> 07:01.671
How did you find out?

07:01.754 --> 07:05.091
Oh, doesn't matter.
You signed the same contract we did.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.676
We are sympathetic,

07:06.759 --> 07:10.471
but the medical disclosure clause does
require that you disclose any diagnosis

07:10.555 --> 07:14.392
with potential to affect job performance.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.643
I'm fine.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.727
For now.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.398
We've put together
a very generous buyout package.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.316
Yeah. This is about Pam's lawsuit.
Isn't it?

07:22.400 --> 07:24.878
- I made it go away. What more do you want?
- A little morality.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.238
- Oh, please.
- Let's keep this professional, okay?

07:27.321 --> 07:32.410
My name is coming off that door
over my dead body.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.872
And that is not gonna happen soon,
no matter how hard you wish for it.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.459
You have always been a liability, Jeri.
We just got lucky this time.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.462
Linda! Look, Jeri.
I, for one, am very sorry.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.088
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.675
But we have a fiduciary duty
to protect the firm.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.512
You'll have a standard window in which
to negotiate the terms of your severance.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.890
There will be no negotiation,
there will be no severance,

07:53.973 --> 07:55.391
because I'm not leaving.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.856
Please reconsider...

08:03.566 --> 08:05.109
or we'll have to force you out.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.798
We are so screwed.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.594
I'm evicted? Says who?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.763
The super. Did you know it's illegal

08:33.846 --> 08:36.890
to run a commercial business
out of a residential-zone property?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.518
Of course I did.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.563
- And did you ever get ahold of Trish?
- Yeah.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.524
Is she okay?

08:45.149 --> 08:48.444
Yeah, she just spaced and forgot
to return some calls. That's all.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.405
It seems like there's something
going on there, like, with her.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.490
Asshole.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.285
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna handle it.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.704
He'll never come around
if you throw a fist in his face.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.540
That has not been my experience.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.377
Time to update the rÃ©sumÃ©.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.090
What is this shit?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.051
- Whoa!
- Pa, she said "shit."

09:15.846 --> 09:17.348
Watch your mouth around my kid.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.934
Oh, like his bigoted father is
some shining role model?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.102
You're breaking the law.

09:21.185 --> 09:23.771
You were all smiles,
checking out the neighbor

09:23.854 --> 09:25.815
until you saw that I was different.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.233
That's called prejudice.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.818
You're not a protected class.

09:28.901 --> 09:31.541
The people in this building want
to raise their families in safety.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.489
- I'm safe as shit.
- Huh?

09:33.573 --> 09:36.659
Superpowers? Accidental deaths? Cops?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.578
All things I and my tenants
want to avoid.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.080
Cops? Is that what did it?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.124
You're what did it.
So you're out of here.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.927
Might want to check
with the landlord first,

09:45.001 --> 09:47.920
because he likes having me around.
He says I protect his investment.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.839
Maybe before bodies started dropping.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.122
'Cause now he agrees with me
that you don't belong here.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.466
Thirty days.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.682
You charged off on a dangerous lead
without backup.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.517
- I was careful.
- You were stupid!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.728
- That's how you get yourself killed!
- Hey, back off!

10:05.021 --> 10:07.440
"People are dying." Your words, not mine.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.984
I don't know what you're into,
but you're in over your head.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.235
That is such sexist bullshit.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.281
- You were dodging bombs in Damascus.
- God damn it! I was worried about you.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.036
Man, karma sucks
the biggest dick.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.585
- Meaning?
- Sergine.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.630
Your ex?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.965
I came home after being on assignment
for three months,

10:33.049 --> 10:35.801
and she'd moved out. Gone. Not a word.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.429
You said she was unstable.
What does that have to do...

10:38.512 --> 10:41.182
She wasn't unstable.
She was just tired of being...

10:43.017 --> 10:44.977
the worried girl left behind.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.106
Last night, that was me.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.108
I really am sorry.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.363
- Babe, are you a target?
- No.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.450
Well, I don't know. But you could be.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.577
Listen, I...

11:03.079 --> 11:04.997
This thing, us...

11:07.124 --> 11:08.626
The press is loving it.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.215
"Award-winning journalist
settles for vapid child star."

11:14.298 --> 11:15.698
I wouldn't call tabloids the press.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.219
My point is
everyone knows I care about you.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.433
I think you should stay away
until Jess and I close this case.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.477
- Not gonna happen.
- Well, it has to.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.734
How about we both stop
telling each other what to do?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.612
You know, I'm gonna go.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.614
I need some time.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.214
- Jeri.
- Not a good time, Franklin.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.298
Their buyout proposal.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.342
Chao had me draw it up.
I didn't have a choice.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.321
I don't know what's going on, but that
medical disclosure clause is bullshit!

12:01.345 --> 12:02.345
Franklin! Okay.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.888
Stop.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.226
You're sick. Don't let them
discriminate against you for it.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.395
Let me do something. Let me help you.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.232
- You want to help me?
- We can fight this.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.400
Do you think we're friends?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.360
- I'm sorry?
- Do you think

12:16.444 --> 12:20.906
because we have shared a table
a handful of times in court

12:20.990 --> 12:24.910
that you have the right
to involve yourself in my life?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.164
My shit? A partner? Your goddamn boss?

12:28.789 --> 12:31.167
- I didn't mean...
- You cannot help me.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.335
You cannot do anything but your job.

12:34.170 --> 12:39.467
So, um, exercise some goddamn discretion
and bury your head in the sand,

12:39.550 --> 12:41.677
because that's where it belongs,
instead of up my ass.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.305
You're gonna need people.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.266
No one goes through
something like this alone.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.893
Well, allow me to be the first to try.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.733
There are
worse things than death.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.407
Once you're worm food, it's over.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.120
Painless.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.874
Quiet.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.840
While the rest of us
are stuck digging holes,

14:02.424 --> 14:05.594
picking up the pieces and remembering.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.180
Or, I don't know, trying to.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.360
Jess? I got something.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.660
Wow. You've been working.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.537
So have I.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.960
What do you want, a drumroll?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.920
You were right.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.966
Our superintendent has a past.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.218
He's done time.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.388
"Felony check forgery."

16:12.471 --> 16:14.348
How did you know he was an ex-con?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.392
People don't usually panic
at the sight of cops

16:16.475 --> 16:18.519
unless they've ridden
in the back of a cruiser.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.773
So our landlord randomly replaces Alfredo
with this guy?

16:22.856 --> 16:26.568
- Who's Alfredo?
- The old super. He was good people.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.362
His wife used to make empanadas
on Sundays.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.005
Always passed them around the building.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.865
I guess not to you.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.368
Rare teaching moment, Malcolm.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.330
If the old super was such a gem,
empanadas for days,

16:38.414 --> 16:39.832
but he still got canned...

16:40.833 --> 16:44.461
- Oscar's got something on our landlord.
- Pay him a visit and find out.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.716
And be nice.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.927
The nicer, the better.
Eugene can be a dick.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.862
Dr. Leslie Hansen worked
at Metro-General

19:14.945 --> 19:16.488
in the '90s and then nothing.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.615
Twenty years of web presence
completely wiped out,

19:18.699 --> 19:20.409
and that takes some doing.

19:24.746 --> 19:25.956
Go ahead and say it.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.125
"I told you so."

19:29.751 --> 19:33.130
Even I have to admit
the hypno-quack doctor made a dent.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.842
"Open the door."

19:38.010 --> 19:39.261
I told you so.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.765
How pissed was Griffin?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.896
- Not just pissed. Worried.
- He should be.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.064
Because I'm an inexperienced
little radio journalist

19:51.148 --> 19:52.388
who can't even leap a building?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.611
Because we're closing in.
And that's when it gets dangerous.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.823
I told him to stay away from me
until all this is over.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.744
I bet a guy who has seen literal war zones
took that swimmingly.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.245
Yeah.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.832
I love him, you know.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.794
Probably means
he has a pornography addiction

20:12.878 --> 20:15.214
or a secret family in Iowa.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.215
Iowa?

20:16.298 --> 20:18.967
Yeah, secret families are always stashed
in flyover states.

20:20.969 --> 20:21.970
He doesn't.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.348
I looked into him.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.060
You have often needed protection
from your own vagina.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.397
You found nothing?

20:33.774 --> 20:35.317
Oh, I found some stuff.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.736
The dude has lived, but...

20:39.863 --> 20:41.949
he is an actual decent human being.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.120
- Shit.
- Yeah.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.832
Can't let him end up like Simpson.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.132
- Where'd you find Hansen's address?
- Her medical school loans.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.761
I tracked her payments back
to this building, which went up in 1939.

21:02.844 --> 21:06.181
No one in New York City gives up
a rent-controlled apartment. Ever.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.644
Yes.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.565
Chinese food!

21:26.535 --> 21:27.535
Dr. Hansen?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.248
Hello?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.001
Maybe she went out for groceries
or something.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.129
This place is too clean.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.716
She could just be a neat person.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.761
Okay, maybe a little OCD.

21:46.346 --> 21:49.141
Or maybe she's not the sentimental type.

21:49.224 --> 21:51.435
I'm not sentimental,
but I still have shit.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.730
You're right. Too clean.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.649
She's covering her tracks,
or someone's covering for her.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.735
- God damn it.
- We'll track her down.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.363
I miss the days
when I didn't want to know anything.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.282
I blame you for that.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.075
I'll take it.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.910
The apartment's been rented.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.164
You wouldn't want it anyway. No elevator.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.250
When did the tenant move out?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.211
Saw a lady carrying boxes
down to the basement last week.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.630
But my nephew's spoken for this place.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.800
Leslie Hansen? She cleaned it out herself?

22:23.884 --> 22:27.929
How should I know? I got enough problems
without chatting up my neighbors.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.973
Let's check the basement.

22:32.809 --> 22:33.809
Thank you.

22:58.418 --> 22:59.669
Do you smell that?

23:01.129 --> 23:05.342
It's, like, mold. Maybe the toxic kind.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.969
It's coming from this thing.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.432
I thought they stopped using these
in the '90s.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.938
Yeah, I'm not sure I want
to know what's in that.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.906
It's not hot,
but that smell is recent.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.429
If I was sitting on evidence
of illegal human experimentation,

23:30.492 --> 23:31.743
I'd burn it, too.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.622
Do you think there's anything left?

23:39.668 --> 23:40.788
There's something.

23:43.296 --> 23:45.507
Oh, my God!

23:47.008 --> 23:49.761
Oh, my God!

23:50.554 --> 23:51.763
Oh, my God!

23:54.307 --> 23:55.350
Could that...

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
Could that be Dr. Leslie Hansen?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.272
I don't know.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.359
We need to get an ID.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.619
I'm not touching it.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.306
Can I help you?

24:34.389 --> 24:37.475
I hope so, sir.
I live in your building on West 46th.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.395
If there's an issue,
I'd prefer you settle it with the super.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.689
Unfortunately, the super is the issue.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.235
- I work at Alias Investigations...
- What? Sorry... You work for her?

24:47.319 --> 24:53.867
For Jessica Jones, yes.
And Mr. Arocho, he's trying to evict her.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.578
Now, I've heard that you're
a very reasonable man.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.141
Who said I was reasonable?

24:58.663 --> 25:02.500
You have a stellar reputation, sir,
in the building.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.544
Ms. Jones didn't say I was reasonable.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.881
She said I was an "entitled prick
of a slumlord." That's a quote.

25:07.964 --> 25:10.592
Well, I'm sure
she didn't mean that.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.303
'Cause, obviously, you're very nice.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.556
She sent you here, right?

25:17.224 --> 25:18.517
Oh, that's very clever.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.062
Yeah, she's completely devoid of charm,
while you...

25:22.604 --> 25:23.980
You are not.

25:24.064 --> 25:28.485
I'm just here
to discuss the situation.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.278
My discussing days are over.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.572
- I'm off the market.
- No, dude, you don't understand.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.699
No, you don't understand.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.869
See, that is my boyfriend Keo.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.705
He's finally moving here
from Cambodia next week.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.540
I'm sorry she wasted your time.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.462
- Your new super is biased.
- No. My new super is very good to me.

25:47.545 --> 25:51.007
And if he wants Ms. Jones out, she's out.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.631
Maury Tuttlebaum.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.177
At least one guy
who's seen more dead bodies than me.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.644
But every one of them tells a story.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.192
Hopefully, Maury can tell me yours.

27:05.623 --> 27:06.624
Oh, shit.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.338
Nice.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.631
Thank you, Maury.

27:50.710 --> 27:54.756
- Hi, Maury. Remember me?
- Sure. Duck confit.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.467
I recommend
the seared foie gras this time.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.011
I need another favor.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.181
- I started listening to your show.
- Oh?

28:03.264 --> 28:06.267
You hooked me with that profile
on the executive chef at Beirut.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.269
You want a res at Beirut? Done.

28:08.853 --> 28:12.273
- You should do more stories like that.
- I'm moving away from lifestyle.

28:12.649 --> 28:17.320
Listen, I'm offering you a favor.
You in?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.156
In exchange for what?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.868
That dismemberment on Orchard Street.
I want to catch who did it.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.830
Dismemberment?
Nothing like that's come in today.

28:26.913 --> 28:31.876
A cop tipped me.
It's logged in as "D-B-2-3-5-9-7."

28:37.966 --> 28:39.718
"Unidentified human head"?

28:40.927 --> 28:42.971
Oh, Christ. Too much Malbec last night.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.055
Maury.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.016
I want a call when the ID comes in.

28:47.976 --> 28:48.977
What do you want?

28:50.061 --> 28:51.062
Beirut.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.753
You're off the clock.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.130
Don't you want to know
how it went with the landlord?

29:18.965 --> 29:20.425
Not tonight, I don't.

29:20.508 --> 29:24.596
Next time you plan to objectify me,
at least tell me first.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.849
That's not really how
objectification works.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.810
Well, he didn't bite.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.605
He has a Cambodian boyfriend
who's moving here.

29:33.688 --> 29:36.149
He even keeps a painting of him
front and center.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.905
- A painting?
- Yeah, he's backing Oscar.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.072
He loves the guy.

29:43.156 --> 29:47.327
He said that he'd been "good to him,"
but wouldn't go into specifics.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.348
What are you doing?

30:11.518 --> 30:12.644
Calling the super.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.659
Hey. Sorry to call so late.
If only I were handy myself.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.369
It's this way.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.579
In there.

30:43.883 --> 30:46.010
Yeah. It's just a heavy flow
kind of month.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.555
I'll leave you to it.

31:12.078 --> 31:13.079
Hey, Vido.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.793
Uh, what's up? What are you doing up
this late on a school night?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.920
Where's my dad?

31:21.004 --> 31:24.716
He's downstairs. But you know what?
He told me to keep an eye on you.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.050
My dad doesn't like you.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.178
But you do, right?

31:31.514 --> 31:32.515
So...

31:33.933 --> 31:36.728
do you have any cool toys in your room
you wanna show me?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.062
Do you know Captain America?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.106
I've got his action figure.

31:40.189 --> 31:43.192
But I lost the shield,
so I made him a new one.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.361
All by myself.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.865
I just glued a magnet to it,
so it looks like the real one.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.368
And then I painted it,
but Cap's shield is cooler.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.788
But this one doesn't have to take down
any aliens, so it'll do.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.458
Super Lady, are you coming?

31:59.834 --> 32:00.877
I'll be right there.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.593
Papi.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.804
Can she stay with me
and read me a bedtime story?

32:11.888 --> 32:13.306
No, buddy. It's late, okay?

32:13.389 --> 32:15.029
I need you to go to your room, go to bed.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.936
- But, Papi...
- Estevido, do as I say.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.739
Get out.

32:29.822 --> 32:34.243
Did you paint the landlord's boyfriend
before or after you forged his passport?

32:35.161 --> 32:36.704
You're one phone call away from jail.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.997
I'm not the one on parole.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.791
You looked into me?

32:39.874 --> 32:41.960
Alias Investigations.

32:42.669 --> 32:46.089
It says it right there on the door
to my illegal business.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.674
You're really poking this bear.

32:47.757 --> 32:51.386
Green cards are the trickiest IDs
to forge. You must be good.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.596
Look, I don't give a shit
what you do up here.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.682
Just tear up my eviction.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.308
Prove it.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.314
These were taken for a false ID.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.485
They're for a piece of art,
which I can prove.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.946
But go ahead, turn me in.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.579
Hey.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.918
I didn't know you were on parole
when I brought the cops here. All right?

33:24.002 --> 33:24.919
I'm not an asshole.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.214
No? What kind of person takes advantage
of a little kid's fantasies

33:28.297 --> 33:29.882
to get inside someone's apartment?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.801
I figured he'd be asleep.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.011
That's your excuse?

33:36.305 --> 33:39.809
That kid means everything to me.
Okay? He's my reason for being.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.729
Okay, do you have anyone
that makes you feel like that?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.482
Or have they all run away from you?

34:02.749 --> 34:05.334
Maybe you think I'm crazy,
but I was normal once...

34:05.418 --> 34:08.254
It was my 18th birthday. I got drunk,

34:08.337 --> 34:10.797
and I woke up in the hospital...

34:20.266 --> 34:21.434
Who sent you?

34:23.811 --> 34:25.103
What the hell, Trish?

34:25.688 --> 34:26.688
Griffin? What...

34:27.565 --> 34:29.817
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

34:30.443 --> 34:33.446
- You said you needed time.
- I meant a few hours.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.864
A few hours.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.659
Why's it so dark in here?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.536
I was doing research.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.040
I lost track of time.

34:44.998 --> 34:46.000
What's with the gun?

34:46.626 --> 34:49.337
- Why do you even own a gun?
- I like guns.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.255
Right.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.424
Okay.

34:54.467 --> 34:55.802
You brought groceries.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.638
Yeah, for a vegetable tagine.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.811
You brought me okra,
and I kicked your ass for it.

35:04.894 --> 35:09.023
That's a bit of an overstatement.
The sidearm is a nice look, though.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.360
- You any good with it?
- You gonna ask for my drill time, too?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.278
Okay. I, uh...

35:15.404 --> 35:17.240
I came by to make sure you were okay.

35:19.659 --> 35:23.955
Well, I'm not. And all I can do about it
is wait for the phone to ring.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.498
It doesn't look like you're waiting.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.793
This guy a lead?

35:29.836 --> 35:30.836
Could've been.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.005
If I'd have checked my fan mail.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.717
You were right. I'm in over my head.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.262
Hey. In over your head
is exactly where you want to be.

35:39.345 --> 35:43.099
You have what every journalist wants.
You have a platform.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.935
This guy reached out to you.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.062
How many other leads are listening?

35:51.649 --> 35:54.068
You didn't win all those awards
for nothing, did you?

35:58.531 --> 35:59.531
Hey.

36:01.117 --> 36:06.038
You know, I've survived this long
without getting my dick shot off.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.002
Well, I'll go lock it up.

36:13.838 --> 36:14.839
Then okra.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.677
- Is okra a euphemism for sex?
- Oh, yeah.

37:04.305 --> 37:07.099
Jesus. God damn it.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.113
Never been to your place of business.

37:21.697 --> 37:22.907
Bucket list complete.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.744
I was hoping you'd see this,
my trek across town,

37:26.827 --> 37:29.830
the ride in that urinal of an elevator,
as an olive branch.

37:29.914 --> 37:34.001
I'm not interested in taking a job,
any job, that comes from you.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.837
This is a legal complaint.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.465
The first step
in filing a lawsuit against you.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.301
Pryce Cheng is suing me?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.011
Idiot.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.140
- And you're repping him. Why?
- I wanted you back in the fold.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.434
- And you thought this would get me back?
- I did.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.647
And then...

37:55.898 --> 37:58.651
something happened,
and I'm trying a different approach.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.194
I'm working a case right now.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.238
Right here in my little mind,

38:02.321 --> 38:04.991
and there is no room in it
for you or your bullshit.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.158
It's not bullshit.

38:07.702 --> 38:08.786
It's... I...

38:10.371 --> 38:14.166
I need five minutes of your time. Please.

38:18.504 --> 38:19.505
Fine.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.806
I pictured your place very much like this.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.224
You have five minutes.

38:34.687 --> 38:37.315
- Should we sit?
- Just tell me why you're here.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.110
I need your help.

38:44.238 --> 38:45.239
With?

38:45.323 --> 38:49.910
Finding leverage against my partners to
prevent them pushing me out of the firm.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.787
- On what grounds?
- Contractual.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.123
- Is it legitimate?
- It is.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.250
What do they have on you?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.006
I'm gonna find out anyway.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.469
I have ALS.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.140
It's a progressive
neuro-degenerative disease.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.184
I know.

39:15.603 --> 39:20.858
It gives my partners cause to invoke
a medical disclosure clause.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.488
I'm not even showing symptoms.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.032
A cramp here or there.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.577
It's more annoying
than anything.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.040
It could take eight years to kill me.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.709
Or two.

39:39.752 --> 39:40.795
No one knows.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.132
It's ironic, isn't it?

39:45.216 --> 39:49.595
I've spent my whole life
amassing this power and control,

39:49.678 --> 39:51.639
thinking somehow it would protect me.

39:54.100 --> 39:55.184
If I believed in God,

39:55.267 --> 39:58.270
I'd say her sense of humor is for shit.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.735
I... I thought about taking the buyout...

40:06.821 --> 40:12.076
living on an island, drinking rum,
making love to beautiful women...

40:13.244 --> 40:15.621
Nothing but time to contemplate my future.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.506
My future is nothing
but a goddamn horror show.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.596
I'm alone.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.893
Um... I'm estranged from my family.

40:40.062 --> 40:43.065
All I have are my clients,

40:44.817 --> 40:45.818
my firm,

40:47.278 --> 40:48.863
and the respect of my colleagues.

40:50.906 --> 40:54.493
The only thing I will leave behind
is my name on that door.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.873
And a whole lot of money.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.709
I plan to spend every penny of it
before I die.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.049
Chao and Benowitz are...

41:09.133 --> 41:11.927
They are not perfect.
There's got to be dirt there.

41:19.226 --> 41:20.519
There's dirt everywhere.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.315
You just have to know where to look.

41:26.108 --> 41:29.528
And that's our show.
Thank you for listening to Trish Talk.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.323
But before we sign off,

41:33.199 --> 41:38.496
I want to talk about an upcoming series
that is very important to all of us here.

41:38.579 --> 41:41.790
We're calling it
"Unsung Heroes of Medicine."

41:41.874 --> 41:45.044
Our first hero is
an innovative trauma doctor

41:45.127 --> 41:47.880
whose research has led
to unprecedented breakthroughs.

41:48.797 --> 41:51.133
Her name is Dr. Leslie Hansen.

41:51.842 --> 41:58.057
Now, I want to hear from Dr. Hansen's
friends, patients, and colleagues.

41:58.140 --> 42:03.187
So call in and contribute
to a very special Trish Talk.

42:07.816 --> 42:11.403
Would you rather enjoy
the heat of summer than suffer through it?

42:11.487 --> 42:14.573
Does July in Cabo sound better than July
in the subway?

42:14.657 --> 42:15.699
Don't trust...

42:15.783 --> 42:20.788
Okay. You can just transfer any calls
to my cell or text me if...

42:20.871 --> 42:24.083
Or e-mail or fax or send a pigeon.

42:24.792 --> 42:25.709
I got it.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.877
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

42:29.255 --> 42:30.631
Trish Talk, this is...

42:31.757 --> 42:32.758
Hold, please.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.928
Please tell me that's someone
who knows Dr. Hansen.

42:36.011 --> 42:38.347
No, it's Dr. Hansen herself.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.023
This is Trish Walker.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.277
Dr. Leslie Hansen. I think we should talk.

42:52.278 --> 42:56.782
So, "Meet me tonight" and "Come alone"?
Could this be any more cloak-and-dagger?

42:56.865 --> 43:00.202
I mean, you can't blame her
for being cautious. People have died.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.204
Yeah. One of them is in her basement.

43:02.288 --> 43:05.291
But if she is who she says she is,
then who's in the incinerator?

43:05.374 --> 43:07.459
Maury will call when he gets an ID.

43:07.543 --> 43:11.380
In the meantime, I am gonna go and meet
the person who says she's Dr. Hansen.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.799
- No, you're not.
- I don't need your permission.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.843
You saw what happened to Simpson.

43:15.926 --> 43:17.052
This is our case.

43:17.136 --> 43:20.306
Then we should have discussed
whether or not you go on the air and say,

43:20.389 --> 43:22.016
"Hey, IGH, I'm over here. Kill me."

43:22.099 --> 43:25.477
You don't know what you're walking into
any more than I do.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.354
I'm walking in with powers.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.733
It's my voice on the radio.
She wants to meet with me.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.112
- You're right.
- Thank you.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.078
What are you doing?

43:39.908 --> 43:41.160
Jess, what are you doing?

43:41.952 --> 43:46.373
"Dear TMZ, Patsy and Griffin
are on the outs. Hot tip."

43:47.916 --> 43:48.917
God damn it.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.420
Can't do cloak-and-dagger
with the paparazzi on your tail.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.298
Griffin has gone out of his way
to be nice to you.

43:54.381 --> 43:55.382
He'll understand.

44:01.555 --> 44:04.808
Hey, Malcolm.
Get over to Trish's place and sit on her.

45:05.994 --> 45:09.456
Cosmo. You don't look like
a brown liquor drinker.

45:12.334 --> 45:13.919
I agreed to talk to Trish Walker...

45:14.002 --> 45:15.762
- Tough shit. You're talking to me.
- No way.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.173
Let me rephrase that.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.675
You're talking to me,

45:19.758 --> 45:22.302
or I'm ripping your spine out
through your ear.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.429
You know I can.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.522
Why did you reach out to Trish?

45:36.817 --> 45:38.610
She's spreading lies.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.240
And you were gonna, what, have her killed?

45:43.323 --> 45:47.327
- I was going to tell her the truth.
- Well, let's do that, then.

45:48.620 --> 45:52.875
I'll get you started.
You were an ER doc at Metro-General.

45:54.293 --> 45:57.504
You also siphoned patients to IGH.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.258
Seventeen years ago,

46:02.676 --> 46:05.304
an injured orphan girl came through
and you thought,

46:06.138 --> 46:08.599
"Perfect candidate to torture."

46:09.224 --> 46:10.100
No.

46:10.184 --> 46:13.395
No, you weren't an ER doc?
Or, no, you didn't do this to me?

46:13.479 --> 46:14.813
Do what? Save your life?

46:15.731 --> 46:16.732
Are you kidding me?

46:23.530 --> 46:24.948
You're wrong about IGH.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.944
Everything your friend Trish said
about them is wrong.

46:27.993 --> 46:30.579
- Who is "them"?
- The good guys.

46:30.662 --> 46:34.875
The good guys put a body
in your basement, Les.

46:34.958 --> 46:39.004
The good guys are cleaning house.

46:39.087 --> 46:43.425
Maybe they're just protecting
their reputation, their legacy.

46:43.509 --> 46:46.178
They're burying it because they know
what they did was heinous.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.097
Talk, Les.

46:50.766 --> 46:55.646
I have 17 years of questions,
and they are deep.

46:55.729 --> 46:59.066
You survived. And that's all that matters.

46:59.149 --> 47:01.360
It mattered to Robert Coleman, too.

47:02.778 --> 47:04.154
And to Kozlov.

47:05.113 --> 47:06.114
And Simpson.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.075
They're not you.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.743
'Cause they're dead?

47:11.411 --> 47:12.412
Am I next?

47:13.956 --> 47:15.040
Is Trish?

47:16.124 --> 47:17.668
What else are you hiding?

47:18.335 --> 47:20.045
Doesn't matter.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.380
You say that again...

47:22.798 --> 47:24.007
and I'll kill you.

47:25.592 --> 47:26.593
Look at me.

47:28.136 --> 47:31.306
You were an ER doc
at Metro-General Hospital,

47:31.390 --> 47:34.351
and you also siphoned patients to IGH.

47:35.769 --> 47:36.770
Go.

47:42.609 --> 47:46.196
Christ, Malcolm.
My door is reinforced steel

47:46.280 --> 47:48.282
and my building
is surrounded by long lenses.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.409
So, you can go.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.244
Not if I wanna keep my job.

47:54.705 --> 47:56.456
- Okay, come in.
- Thanks.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.753
Marilyn, you're a publicist.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.798
It's your job to make it go away,
so make it go away.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.177
Look, I'm sorry Jess
is making you do this. It's...

48:09.261 --> 48:10.304
No, it's fine.

48:11.179 --> 48:15.434
You never responded to my texts
after that day.

48:16.727 --> 48:17.853
There was nothing to say.

48:18.729 --> 48:23.483
- The video, are you gonna use it?
- I'm hoping I don't have to.

48:26.737 --> 48:27.821
You...

48:29.489 --> 48:32.909
Jess is out there chasing a major lead,
and I'm stuck in here.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.494
She's not a fan of sidekicks.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.665
Marilyn, I swear to God...

48:40.667 --> 48:42.210
Maury, what do you got?

48:42.628 --> 48:47.341
An ID on your crispy critter.
A Dr. Leslie Hansen.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.468
Guess she lived in the building.

48:51.845 --> 48:53.972
- Okay, what's wrong?
- Call Jessica.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.351
Just tell me what's going on.

48:59.895 --> 49:02.981
Alias Investigations. Leave a message.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.609
- Listen to me...
- Jesus!

49:05.692 --> 49:07.361
There's paparazzi outside the building.

49:07.444 --> 49:10.197
- I know they're a pain...
- No. Help me sneak past them.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.365
Right.

49:11.448 --> 49:15.077
Look, Jessica might not want a sidekick,
but tonight she needs one.

49:25.420 --> 49:28.173
- Hey. Anybody talking in there?
- No, man. Sorry.

49:30.050 --> 49:34.846
Wait, wait. Share your tip.
I'll give you first shot and 200 bucks.

49:38.517 --> 49:41.353
Front desk says Patsy's
at Griffin's place. 10th and Greenwich.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.437
Go! Go! Go!

49:43.981 --> 49:44.981
Come on!

50:07.629 --> 50:10.757
It was groundbreaking
genetic-editing technology.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.593
- We were saving lives.
- By giving people powers?

50:13.677 --> 50:17.931
No, the powers were a side effect.
A rare interaction with certain DNA.

50:18.557 --> 50:20.058
- Lucky me.
- You're damn right.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.355
You were brought back from the dead.

50:25.939 --> 50:28.191
Literally. You died on the table.

50:29.401 --> 50:32.112
Your body shut down.
No one thought you'd make it.

50:33.029 --> 50:34.656
It was a miracle.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.660
- You should have let me die.
- What?

50:39.244 --> 50:44.082
You should have let me die with my family,
like I was supposed to.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.042
Don't you dare say that.

50:46.126 --> 50:49.421
I had no one.

50:49.504 --> 50:52.507
You had your life. You had your abilities.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.386
- You survived for a reason!
- What reason? Tell me.

50:56.470 --> 51:00.724
You should be thankful.
You should be thanking your goddamn stars!

51:01.892 --> 51:04.519
You know,
I think I did survive for a reason.

51:05.604 --> 51:09.232
To make sure you never do
what you did to me ever again.

51:09.858 --> 51:11.234
You ungrateful...

51:24.206 --> 51:25.582
You okay?

51:26.500 --> 51:30.045
Who are you?

51:34.007 --> 51:35.383
Whoa!

51:55.362 --> 51:57.989
Malcolm! Oh, my God. Are you okay?

52:02.744 --> 52:04.246
This your new boyfriend?

52:08.875 --> 52:09.875
What's his name?

52:11.753 --> 52:13.046
What's his name, Pats?

52:15.799 --> 52:16.839
Are you all right?

52:17.759 --> 52:19.344
Hey. Freedom of the press.

52:20.136 --> 52:23.056
Hey, I'm just doing my job.
Please don't break it.

52:23.974 --> 52:24.974
Gotcha.
