01:14.040 --> 01:16.500
- Here you go. Good as new.
- Oh, come on, Tim.

01:16.599 --> 01:19.390
You can't tell me that actually works.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.030
- Just like it was.
- Impressed.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.349
- Doesn't take a genius to fix a hair dyer.
- And that's why we asked you.

01:26.439 --> 01:28.549
- Good one, Jill.
- Thank you so much.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.659
I just love it when we girls get together
and do our little estrogen humor.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.549
I'm going to the park
to ride my new bike.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.829
Randy, why are you wearing
all those pads?

01:38.920 --> 01:41.030
- Cos they look cool.
- And you gotta look cool,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.310
cos you're not riding
that kiddy bike any more.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.469
You'll be riding the new
KX-80 man-sized speed demon.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.790
Hey, have fun but ride slowly, OK?

01:50.879 --> 01:54.189
Jill, ride slowly? A man's got to make
challenges for himself.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.390
Try to visualize you're at
the Bonneville Salt flats.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.189
Right out of the chute.
200 miles an hour… 300, 400, 500…

02:01.280 --> 02:03.739
Fur ball, Tim?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.420
I'll be going to the park now.

02:09.158 --> 02:11.750
"I would…" Oh, a chain letter.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.400
- Oh, no, is it addressed to me?
- No, it's to me.

02:14.479 --> 02:16.629
Let me see, let me see.

02:16.719 --> 02:19.550
"Within 24 hours of receiving this chain
letter, it must be sent to ten people."

02:19.639 --> 02:21.710
"If you break the chain,
you will have bad luck."

02:21.800 --> 02:24.990
Oh, I'm shaking in my shorts.
Look at this. Watch this.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.870
Shake all you want, but listen to this.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.270
"A naval officer in Borneo
disregarded this letter

02:31.360 --> 02:34.750
and three days later,
he was decapitated."

02:36.280 --> 02:38.150
"Naval officer gets his head cut off."
You read it wrong.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.909
It says, "A head waiter
got his navel cut off."

02:42.000 --> 02:45.620
Don't do that.
Why take chances? You don't know.

02:45.719 --> 02:48.430
This naval officer might have had
his head cut off.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.229
Honey, honey, don't worry.
If you get your head cut off,

02:51.319 --> 02:54.030
I'll staple gun it back on.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.990
Tim, that letter's addressed to you. You're
the one who's gonna have the bad luck.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.189
God, you're right, Karen.
Something horrible could happen to me.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.870
I'll see you guys. Bye-bye.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.509
I need a head, I need a head. You gotta…

03:15.240 --> 03:16.750
- Tim?
- Huh?

03:16.840 --> 03:18.949
Where have you been? You were
supposed to be here half an hour ago.

03:19.039 --> 03:22.389
Oh, boy. My battery went dead,
so I had to charge it up.

03:22.479 --> 03:24.430
I get to work,
somebody was parked in my spot.

03:24.520 --> 03:30.590
Oh, gee, that's too bad. But I have a feeling
your luck will be changing soon.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.110
You sound like Jill.
She got all upset this morning

03:33.199 --> 03:36.509
cos some idiot sent me
a stupid chain letter.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.270
Well, he wasn't necessarily an idiot, Tim.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.789
Well, I don't care what he was.
I threw it out.

03:43.879 --> 03:46.509
Well, you… You shouldn't have done that.

03:46.599 --> 03:48.979
- You know, something bad could happen.
- Like what?

03:49.080 --> 03:52.669
I don't know. You…
you could be decapitated.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.270
You sent me that letter, didn't you?

04:00.360 --> 04:03.979
I didn't say I sent it. The chain letter
says you're not supposed to say.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.189
- What chain letter?
- The one I'm not saying I sent you.

04:08.280 --> 04:12.509
I should've figured it was you.
I'm the only person you know.

04:12.599 --> 04:15.789
I'm just saying
that all day I've had good luck.

04:15.879 --> 04:18.389
- Really?
- I found $20 on the sidewalk.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.230
And this morning,
I won a shovel on a radio contest.

04:24.639 --> 04:29.629
Ooh, a shovel? You must have been
listening to "Grave Digging With Gus".

04:29.720 --> 04:33.069
Tim, Tim, did you see this message?
Someone named George Foreman called

04:33.160 --> 04:35.230
and he said, "I'd be happy to do it."

04:35.319 --> 04:37.949
Yes. Thank you, Lisa.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.550
- George Foreman the boxer?
- No, this is George Foreman the hypnotist.

04:41.639 --> 04:44.470
- Yes, George Foreman the boxer.
- Well, that's great.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.910
Is he gonna come on the show
and build something?

04:47.000 --> 04:51.269
No, I suggest he come on
and spar with you for a couple of hours.

04:55.639 --> 04:57.939
He has a charity,
a George Foreman youth home,

04:58.040 --> 05:00.670
and I did a little banquet for him
and he said, "How can I repay you?"

05:00.759 --> 05:03.430
I said, "How about coming on Tool Time?"
He said, "Yes."

05:03.519 --> 05:09.430
So, Mr Negativity,
maybe I've got some luck after all.

05:09.959 --> 05:13.389
I'm just saying that if you send that
chain letter, you'll have better luck.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.790
Al, listen. Having George Foreman
on the show, that is good luck.

05:17.879 --> 05:21.550
Winning a shovel, that's not good luck.
You do not have good luck.

05:21.639 --> 05:24.829
Al, Al. I almost forgot.
The heat's broken in my apartment.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.709
Can I stay at your place tonight?

05:32.439 --> 05:34.670
- Sure, Lisa.
- Thank you.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.589
I can't believe you tried that stupid jump
on your new bike.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.870
You're going to be grounded
till you're dead.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.259
We have to think of a lie fast.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.470
We could say lightning hit it.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.949
Yeah, right. I just wish there was some way
we could blame this on Mark.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.350
Yeah, he believes everything we say.
We could tell him he did it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.870
That's even dumber than the lightning.

06:05.959 --> 06:09.470
Come on, let's hide this in the bushes
before Mom sees us.

06:10.560 --> 06:14.259
Honey, if you want to blow bubbles,
you have to flatten the gum out first.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.350
- Like that.
- You mean like this?

06:16.439 --> 06:19.550
- Well, sort of.
- Yeah, well, that's one way.

06:19.639 --> 06:23.259
Now, put it on the tip of your tongue
and blow.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.509
I think you need
to practice that some more.

06:32.079 --> 06:34.459
Hello. Oh, hi, Al.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.509
No, he's not here yet.

06:37.600 --> 06:42.620
What? He should do what with his hands?
What's wrong with his hands?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.420
Is he all right?

06:47.519 --> 06:49.629
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I'll tell him. Thanks.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.100
- Bye.
- What happened?

06:52.199 --> 06:54.189
Al and Tim were working
with some dye on the show,

06:54.279 --> 06:57.629
and Tim accidentally
dyed his hands green.

06:58.439 --> 07:00.230
- Oh, hi, Tim.
- Hi, Karen. How are you doing?

07:00.319 --> 07:01.379
Good, and you?

07:01.480 --> 07:02.459
- Great.
- Great.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.670
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, dear.

07:03.759 --> 07:05.389
- How was work?
- It was good.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.149
- No bad luck today, Tim?
- No, it's a great day. Thanks. Wonderful.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.430
- Good.
- Well, come here. Give me a hug.

07:18.399 --> 07:19.829
Tim, come here a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.189
- I…
- Just a second.

07:21.279 --> 07:23.430
Look, I've been feeling really bad about
all the nasty things I've been saying to you.

07:23.519 --> 07:25.310
- Don't… Hey, hey…
- No, no. I'd feel a lot better.

07:25.399 --> 07:26.540
- Let's just start over.
- Good.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.509
Shake?

07:29.720 --> 07:31.350
I don't want to.

07:31.439 --> 07:34.269
Oh, look at this.
The boys left their basketball here again.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.949
Tim, would you get rid of this for me?
Catch.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.550
- Al called. Told us about your hands.
- Why didn't you say something?

07:45.639 --> 07:48.230
Cos this is more fun.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.670
This has nothing to do
with throwing out that chain letter.

08:02.319 --> 08:05.670
- I didn't say that. Did you say that?
- Not that.

08:05.759 --> 08:08.220
I had good luck today.

08:09.240 --> 08:12.709
- Guess who decided to be on Tool Time?
- Who?

08:12.800 --> 08:16.149
- George Foreman.
- George Foreman.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.069
- Yeah.
- Is he an athlete?

08:18.160 --> 08:20.189
- Yes, Jill.
- I know who he is.

08:20.279 --> 08:22.740
- I know you do.
- The quarterback for the Detroit Tigers.

08:22.839 --> 08:25.350
- No, no, no.
- No, no, that's Arnold Palmer.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.670
- No, no, he's a race car driver.
- Ladies, ladies…

08:27.759 --> 08:31.350
- No, he's… Look…
- Yeah, he won the Super Bowl.

08:33.519 --> 08:37.029
George Foreman happens to be the
former heavy weight champion of the world.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.110
Oh, wow. In what sport?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.830
Boxing. He's a boxer, Jill. Boxing.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.149
Boxing's not a sport.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.940
What do you call a great sport?
Synchronized swimming?

08:50.039 --> 08:52.419
I'm not kidding.
They call boxing "the sweet science".

08:52.519 --> 08:57.269
Oh, really? How scientific is it for mo men
to stand in a ring and pound each other?

08:57.360 --> 09:00.509
I'll show you how it is. Put up your dukes.
Ty to hit me in the face. Come on.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.590
- Tim, I am not gonna fight you.
- Come on.

09:02.679 --> 09:04.549
You're not gonna fight me. I'm just gonna
show you how much skill it takes

09:04.639 --> 09:06.990
- to hit a moving target.
- I don't wanna hit you.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.190
I didn't say you were gonna hit me. I said
you're gonna try to hit me. Ding, ding.

09:10.279 --> 09:11.470
- Stop that.
- Nail him.

09:11.559 --> 09:12.779
- Come on.
- All right.

09:12.879 --> 09:14.669
Good.

09:15.279 --> 09:17.659
Hey, come on. Hit me.
What's the problem?

09:17.759 --> 09:18.980
- Honey?
- I'm going to get you.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.029
Oh, I'm so scared, I'm shaking in my boots.
Come on, come on.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.389
See? It's a science. I'm outthinking you.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.269
I blew a bubble.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.669
God.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.669
- Ooh. It's really getting swollen.
- Yeah.

09:35.759 --> 09:39.230
And red. Maybe we should dye it green
to match your hands.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.259
Well, I'm sorry, honey,
but you made me hit you.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.230
Tim, did she hit you
with a jab or an uppercut?

09:48.320 --> 09:51.070
- It was a lucky punch is what it was.
- Not so lucky for you.

09:51.159 --> 09:55.230
Don't start this. This has nothing to do
with me throwing out that chain letter.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.590
I told you not to throw it away.

09:57.679 --> 09:59.950
You didn't pull it out of the trash
and save it did you?

10:00.039 --> 10:04.309
- No, why? Are you sorry I didn't?
- No, it belongs in the trash.

10:04.399 --> 10:08.950
- Guys, I'm leaving.
- Hey, my luck is changing already.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.179
- Bye, champ.
- Bye.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.269
I was talking to Jill.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.470
Now, if he challenges you to a rematch,
I want you to call me.

10:15.559 --> 10:18.149
Well, I better let his eye heal first.

10:30.679 --> 10:33.669
Where would she put
that darn chain letter?

10:43.159 --> 10:45.149
What are you doing out here?

10:45.240 --> 10:47.909
Nothing. Nothing. I was just out here
getting a little air on that eye.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.710
You were not.
You were looking for that chain letter.

10:50.799 --> 10:54.230
- Was not.
- Was too.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.909
And you're not gonna find it either,
cos the trash was picked up this morning.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.269
Hi-ho, neighbors.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.710
- Oh, hi, Wilson.
- Hey, Wilson.

11:01.799 --> 11:04.389
Tim, I found this kind of
wedged under my fence.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.149
It wouldn't belong to anybody over there,
would it?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.799
- Randy?
- It's Randy's.

11:11.519 --> 11:13.350
- Where's Randy?
- Upstairs.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.190
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

11:15.279 --> 11:16.419
Randy.

11:16.519 --> 11:18.750
- Just a second.
- Nice hands, Dad.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.029
Thanks.
Do you know anything about this?

11:21.120 --> 11:24.070
It looks like it was hit by lightning.

11:24.159 --> 11:26.070
Yeah, right. Lightning?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.830
- Yeah, Mom?
- What happened to the bike?

11:29.919 --> 11:33.620
- Well, it was hit by…
- Don't say "lightning".

11:33.720 --> 11:35.549
Wind.

11:36.759 --> 11:38.750
A strong wind.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.669
- Leave.
- OK.

11:40.759 --> 11:43.909
Not you. Come back here.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.029
- What happened to the bike?
- Dad, your hands are green.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.899
They were hit by lightning.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.149
- What happened to your bike?
- OK.

11:54.240 --> 11:58.019
Stevie Randall double dared me
to jump the ramp down at the park.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.110
What ramp at the park?

12:00.200 --> 12:03.710
We built this five-foot ramp at the bottom
of the hill to see how far we could jump.

12:03.799 --> 12:05.909
- five feet?
- five feet? Wow.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.789
You must have been
shooting off that thing.

12:12.399 --> 12:17.519
- Man is not supposed to fly.
- You could really have hurt yourself.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.669
Well, I would've made the landing
except the bike broke.

12:20.759 --> 12:23.389
I think you should take it back, Dad.
It has a defect.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.870
I think you should go upstairs
while your father and I discuss this.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.990
Come on.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.429
- Dad?
- Yes?

12:32.519 --> 12:36.669
I know you always say
a man should take care of his machine.

12:36.759 --> 12:39.549
And I'm sorry.

12:39.639 --> 12:42.200
But I did beat the record.

12:42.279 --> 12:43.710
- By how much?
- Six feet.

12:43.799 --> 12:45.110
- Yes.
- Tim.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.269
Go on upstairs. You heard me.
Go on, now.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.509
Oh, those crazy kids, honey. You know,
the defect is probably in the bike.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.899
It doesn't matter about the defect.
He did a stupid thing.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.789
- Well, he had to make the jump.
- Why?

12:59.879 --> 13:02.509
Honey, they double dared him.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.950
o .

13:04.039 --> 13:06.789
So, our son was challenged.

13:06.879 --> 13:09.750
He met the challenge
and he's earned their respect.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.710
Oh, I see. So if these kids tell him that he
should jump off a cliff he should do that?

13:13.799 --> 13:16.669
You'd need a bigger bike for that.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.870
This is a pretty common thing for kids.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.629
Oh, when I was young, ten years old,
they're dredging Quarton Lake,

13:24.720 --> 13:28.950
my buddies challenged me to jump off of
a dock into three feet of mud naked.

13:29.039 --> 13:31.789
And I did it. To this day,
do you know what they call me?

13:31.879 --> 13:33.830
The village idiot?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.350
Thank you, everybody.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.429
Thank you, and welcome to Tool Time.

13:46.879 --> 13:51.429
Ho-ho-ho, yourselves. Welcome to the
show. I'm Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

13:51.519 --> 13:54.110
And I'm Al "The Lucky Man" Borland.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.149
You know, we've got a big show this week.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.620
We've got a special guest.
A very special guest.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.470
The former and maybe future heavy weight
champion of the world.

14:03.559 --> 14:09.070
Let's bring him out here, Mr "More Power"
himself, George Foreman. Yeah.

14:19.879 --> 14:23.629
You know, this is a building show. We
build things. What would you like to build?

14:23.720 --> 14:26.100
How about a sandwich?

14:27.240 --> 14:28.950
Well, actually,
we're gonna build a staircase.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.710
I never ate a staircase.

14:31.799 --> 14:34.509
Well, don't start now.
We only have one of them, you know?

14:34.600 --> 14:39.190
Before we get going, I'd like you to sit down
and ask you a few questions, if I could.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.990
A little conversation about challenges.
You're a renowned heavy weight.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.830
You've met a lot of challenges
in your life.

14:43.919 --> 14:46.750
Has there ever been a challenge
you've been unable to meet?

14:46.840 --> 14:49.870
There was this seafood buffet once.

14:53.399 --> 14:57.590
- I wanted to eat 16 plates of fried shrimp.
- Yeah.

14:57.679 --> 15:01.379
But when I got to the 13th plate,
I had trouble. I started to stagger.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.549
- What about the 14th plate?
- TKO.

15:04.639 --> 15:08.179
- Ah. That TKO thing. Yeah.
- Totally keeled over.

15:10.519 --> 15:14.269
Well, I guess we can safely say
you're the heavy champion of the world.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.919
Well… you know… I meant…
Just a little joke, George.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.710
- That dinner taught me something, Tim.
- What's that?

15:18.799 --> 15:21.309
- A man's got to know his limitations.
- Yeah.

15:21.399 --> 15:24.110
That's some good advice
from the champ.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.029
Hey, Tim, is there something wrong
with your eye?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.679
No, no. I hit it on something.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.110
His wife's fist.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.429
Thanks, Al.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.980
You need to put
a thick steak on that eye.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.909
I thought you were supposed
to put ice on a black eye.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.909
Oh, when you're done with ice,
you can't barbecue it.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.299
Why don't we get right on that project?
What do you say? Lisa?

15:46.399 --> 15:49.350
Bring out that staircase.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.350
- OK.
- Here you go, fellas.

15:51.440 --> 15:56.559
Thank you, Lisa. Well, Al's already set up
our staircase, and we're ready to proceed.

15:56.639 --> 15:58.669
Al, what's the next stage
in the staircase assembly?

15:58.759 --> 16:03.750
Well, as you can see, we're about ready
to nail in our risers and tread.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.629
You think that's funny, huh?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.509
Well…

16:14.200 --> 16:18.629
Since you're the guest here,
why don't you hit that first nail, George?

16:18.720 --> 16:20.750
There you go.

16:23.279 --> 16:24.870
George, what are you doing?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.470
Well, if I'm going to hit that nail, Tim,
I've got to get angry with it.

16:27.559 --> 16:29.350
Huh?

16:31.200 --> 16:34.269
So I'm going to close my eyes
and imagine it's Evander Holyfield.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.830
- You going to hold that nail for me?
- Al, hold that nail.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.590
I don't think so, Tim.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.549
- George, hold your own nail.
- I don't think so, Tim.

16:48.279 --> 16:49.750
Lisa?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.549
I don't think so, Tim.

16:53.799 --> 16:57.909
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't I just start the nail for you?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.710
Hey, yeah.

16:59.799 --> 17:02.789
I didn't go to college for nothing, George.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.789
OK, George. Take a wing at that.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.230
We'll get ready with the measurements…

17:10.319 --> 17:12.990
Give way, people.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.069
Good gracious.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.950
One, mo, three, four…
You're out of there.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.190
- Wilson, you over there?
- As far as I know, Tim.

17:32.599 --> 17:36.829
- Are you a superstitious man, Wilson?
- No, I'm not, Tim.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.910
Knock wood.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.390
I'm not superstitious either,
but I know this guy that, in one day,

17:44.480 --> 17:47.990
got a black eye, flattened his finger,
and dyed his hands an odd color.

17:48.079 --> 17:51.029
- Green?
- Yeah.

17:51.119 --> 17:54.269
It's me. I've been having this string
of bad luck lately.

17:54.359 --> 17:57.230
I wonder if it's because I threw out
this cheesy chain letter.

17:57.319 --> 18:00.789
Well, personally, Tim,
I place no credence in chain letters.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.259
Of course, I did have a friend once
who didn't return a chain letter,

18:03.359 --> 18:06.190
and he disappeared mysteriously.

18:06.279 --> 18:09.029
He was a naval officer in Borneo.

18:14.839 --> 18:17.430
- He was decapitated.
- No.

18:17.519 --> 18:19.509
Oh, yeah.

18:21.759 --> 18:25.539
- Well, I'll have to send the family a card.
- What do I do about this chain letter?

18:25.640 --> 18:27.789
Well, Tim, the problem may not be
the chain letter.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.509
Someone's planted the concept
of bad luck in your mind,

18:30.599 --> 18:33.390
and therefore your subconscious
is expecting bad luck.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.190
Ergo, bad luck happens.

18:36.279 --> 18:39.230
There you go.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.069
Bad luck. Bad luck.

18:41.160 --> 18:45.000
What if someone
wasn't as enlightened as me?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.420
How would they
get rid of that curse?

18:47.519 --> 18:52.109
Well, some people think it can be broken
by carrying garlic and wolfsbane.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.950
- Wolfsbane?
- Genus Aconitum Vulpana.

18:55.039 --> 18:58.740
- Yeah, sure.
- Also called monkshood.

18:58.839 --> 19:02.589
It's a herb indigenous
to the Eurasian plain. It's very, very rare.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.430
- Almost impossible to find.
- Where would I go get some?

19:06.519 --> 19:08.509
Right here, Tim.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.950
- Do you have any garlic?
- Be my guest.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.390
Ty to bring that back, Tim.
I'm making pizza.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.630
You know, Dad, jumping off that ramp
really was stupid.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.099
It sure was.
You could have been hurt real bad.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.789
A man's gotta know his limitations.
That's what it is.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.710
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- But I think I know why you did it.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.589
When I was young, I knew this kid,
this real bright, good-looking kid,

19:36.680 --> 19:39.509
that everybody
used to taunt, you know?

19:39.599 --> 19:42.430
They challenged him
and he met their challenge

19:42.519 --> 19:46.750
by diving off a dock
into three feet of mud, naked.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.990
Man, that was stupid.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.950
It wasn't as stupid as what you did.
I think it's kind of brave.

19:55.039 --> 19:56.430
Brave?

19:56.519 --> 20:00.190
Yeah, big shot.
You had pads, I was naked.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.349
Tim, look at this.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.789
Hey, Mom, did you know Dad
jumped into three feet of mud naked?

20:06.880 --> 20:08.670
Again?

20:09.680 --> 20:11.980
And I get busted for ramp jumping.

20:12.079 --> 20:16.309
Yeah, yeah, you just go get ready for bed.
Honey, I was just making this list,

20:16.400 --> 20:21.230
and, you know, I don't think that all this bad
luck is just because of that chain letter.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.029
- You don't, do you?
- No. Listen to this.

20:23.119 --> 20:26.740
In the last month,
you have done the following.

20:26.839 --> 20:30.460
Backed a pickup truck
into a house,

20:30.559 --> 20:33.710
almost electrocuted
yourself three times,

20:33.799 --> 20:38.589
nailed your shoe into the floor,
and glued your head to a table.

20:40.519 --> 20:42.670
What's your point?

20:42.759 --> 20:46.269
Well, the point is, it's not the chain letter
that's bringing you bad luck.

20:46.359 --> 20:49.630
It's you. You're a klutz.
Isn't that great?

20:50.559 --> 20:51.950
Honey, I'm thrilled.

20:52.039 --> 20:54.390
No. Really. You don't have to worry
about being superstitious.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.349
I'm not superstitious.
This is your fault.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.990
- Mine.
- Yes.

20:59.079 --> 21:03.390
You were the one that planted the idea
of bad luck in my mind

21:03.480 --> 21:06.509
and let the ergo
out of my subconscious.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.990
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I did what?

21:09.079 --> 21:10.829
Don't deny this.

21:10.920 --> 21:16.039
You and I are a lot different because
I don't buy into that hocus-pocus jazz.

21:16.119 --> 21:17.670
- What?
- Is that garlic I smell?

21:17.759 --> 21:20.950
- That's a cologne.
- Why is this in your pocket?

21:21.039 --> 21:23.500
- I… I was holding it for Wilson.
- And what is this?

21:23.599 --> 21:25.190
- Huh?
- This. What is this?

21:25.279 --> 21:27.230
Wolfsbane.

21:28.599 --> 21:31.470
Wouldn't be trying to ward off
any evil spirits, would you, Tim?

21:31.559 --> 21:33.940
Wilson said that if
I put those in my pockets,

21:34.039 --> 21:35.829
it would turn bad luck
into good luck.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.029
Really?
How does it do that?

21:39.119 --> 21:41.829
I'll show you. OK.

21:43.559 --> 21:45.269
- Garlic goes here.
- Yeah?

21:45.359 --> 21:47.740
Wolfsbane goes here.

21:47.839 --> 21:53.230
Then you're supposed to take your wife,
give her three kisses. One. Two.

21:53.319 --> 21:55.910
And the third one's really long.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.670
- You know what?
- What?

22:02.759 --> 22:04.190
- Wilson was right.
- About what?

22:04.279 --> 22:06.430
You're about to get real lucky.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.950
- So, is this what we're supposed to do?
- No, here.

22:16.039 --> 22:17.470
- OK. Like that and like that.
- All right.

22:17.559 --> 22:19.549
- All right.
- Now, a lucky punch,

22:19.640 --> 22:21.230
you can't rely on those.
Distractions.

22:21.319 --> 22:23.700
You can always have a distraction
and get a good punch in.

22:23.799 --> 22:27.269
- But what if I hit you again?
- You ain't gonna hit me again.

22:27.359 --> 22:28.910
Mark, come on,
put the bubble gum away.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.630
- Why do you always…
- Dink.

22:33.079 --> 22:34.509
All right.
Let's fight fair, all right?

22:34.599 --> 22:36.670
- This glove is really loose.
- I tightened the glove my…

22:36.759 --> 22:38.549
Dink.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.900
- I'm not falling for this again.
- I can't get my hair out of my mouth.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.789
- You put the earring on there…
- Dink.

22:49.039 --> 22:50.589
- When I say "ready", we start. OK?
- OK.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.789
- All right.
- Dink.

22:54.599 --> 22:55.990
- Is this really that funny to you?
- Yes.

22:56.079 --> 22:57.059
- All right.
- All right.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.470
- Don't hit me in the face again this time.
- OK.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.990
- Don't hit me in the face again this time.
- OK.

23:11.079 --> 23:14.349
- I'm gonna go get George.
- Oh, God.
