If you'll just
let me explain.

Wow. You move pretty good
with that leg, Didi.

And as handi-capable
as one-legged Didi was,

Maybe karma wanted me
somewhere else.

Every time somethin' good
happened to me,

But, as frustrated

Dad came to bail us out.

Everybody's gotten used to them.
It's fine!

12:28.816 --> 12:32.519
[ Earl Narrating ]
He was right. People had gotten
used to them, until now.

[ Airplane Passing Overhead ]
Did you hear that, Doris?
Uh, h-hold on.

12:37.457 --> 12:42.029
Once Dad mentioned the jet noise
on TV, people started to
notice again.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.869
[ Airplane Passing Overhead ]
A lot of people.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.871

All of a sudden, people started
to notice the noise

I am gonna
kick somebody's ass!

13:07.754 --> 13:12.492
My dad's words had reminded
people of how much
they hated the airplanes.

13:12.559 --> 13:17.130
So many people called my dad
the next day that he decided
to enter the election.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.800
Thanks to me,
he was once again fighting
for what he believed in.

I'm Carl Hickey,
and I need your vote.

13:24.237 --> 13:28.608

But I shouldn't have to shout
over airplanes to get it.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.878
[ Laughs ]
Thank you.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.880
Now don't misunderstand
the cookie.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.183
We like air travel.
We just don't want planes
flying over our heads.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.185
It's all on the back
of the cookie.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.353
Good morning.
Vote Hickey.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.324
- Vote Hickey.
- Oh.

All right, way to go, Dad.
We're gonna win this thing.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.300
Will you get
the heck out of here?
What? Why?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.869
I-I'm the reason
you're running again.
I wanna help.

13:55.936 --> 14:00.073
I'm runnin' because the people
asked me to, not because
of your foolish behind. Scram.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.576
Dad, it's on my list.
I need to help.
What list?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.879
Dad, the photographer
from the newspaper's here.
We gotta hurry.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.648
A chicken truck tipped over
on the interstate.

Put more spit on my cowlick
so I look more mayor-like.
"Mayoral."

That's three corrections today.
You're doing interviews.

Keep up the good work.

I always like
to help the homeless.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Unfortunately, things were
still bad between my dad and I,

14:42.482 --> 14:46.586
and they were
about to get worse.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.555
- Dad's gonna lose.
- What?

"Poll shows Carl Hickey
is down by 2,000 votes
among all registered voters."

14:54.027 --> 14:56.829
See, he's gonna
lose again, and blame me
for getting him into it.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.268
What are registered voters?
People who sign up to vote,
I guess.

15:01.334 --> 15:05.072
- You and me should sign up.
- He's down by
more than two votes.

15:05.138 --> 15:09.009
- Can I register to vote?
- He's down by more than
three votes, Catalina.

Wait a second.
[ Earl Narrating ]
And then it hit me.

15:13.113 --> 15:17.250
There must be a ton of people
who could vote for my dad,
but just aren't registered.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.522
A whole untapped market
of uncaring, unregistered...

15:22.589 --> 15:24.824
and even unconscious
voters out there.
[ Snoring ]

15:24.891 --> 15:28.061
And I, Earl Hickey,
could reach 'em.

Uneducated people.

Undesirable people.

After almost no training,
I became an official
voter registrar.

Registering new voters
was fun.

about another kind of "pole."

- Not that it matters.

Because until we reform
the electoral college,

will be ignored, and we'll keep
electing presidents...

a minority of the vote.
