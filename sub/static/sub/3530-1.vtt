WEBVTT

00:11.880 --> 00:12.947
<i>Previously on The Tudors...</i>

00:13.048 --> 00:15.717
We are come here
together to join Henry VIII

00:16.084 --> 00:19.187
and the Lady Jane Seymour.

00:19.288 --> 00:21.422
- I think she'll make him happy.
- With God's help,

00:21.456 --> 00:23.457
- we'll all be happy now.
- I promise you

00:23.525 --> 00:25.860
that I will continue to show
favour to the Lady Mary.

00:25.961 --> 00:28.029
The Lady Mary Tudor.

00:28.130 --> 00:29.664
May I present you to
Her Majesty, Queen Jane.

00:29.731 --> 00:34.435
<i>Princess Elizabeth.
Je suis en famille!</i>

00:34.503 --> 00:36.304
[Applause]

00:36.338 --> 00:38.306
If the new queen favours
the Catholic religion-

00:38.373 --> 00:40.408
as she's rumoured to do, then our whole
Reformation is surely in jeopardy.

00:40.509 --> 00:42.610
We must press ahead with the
dissolution of the monasteries.

00:42.644 --> 00:45.613
My Lord, we have come here to tell
you that a great part of the North

00:45.681 --> 00:47.849
have risen in sudden rebellion
against His Majesty.

00:47.983 --> 00:49.984
We will fight, and we will die!

00:50.052 --> 00:54.255
These wretched men have threatened
my whole realm with uproar!

00:54.323 --> 00:56.224
You told me there was
little opposition.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.860
You told me that most people were
glad to see such places dissolved.

01:01.396 --> 01:02.964
You were wrong.

01:02.998 --> 01:04.866
I'll teach these bastard ingrates

01:05.000 --> 01:08.202
a fearful bloody
lesson in slaughter!

01:11.006 --> 01:12.640
Lady Rochford,
I'd like to appoint you

01:12.674 --> 01:14.842
my principal lady in waiting.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.812
Madam, the King has taken
Lady Misseldon as a mistress.

01:17.880 --> 01:21.582
Do not be troubled for me for
I have great reason to be happy.

01:21.683 --> 01:23.484
- I think you're with child.
- I am.

01:23.552 --> 01:26.721
I want you to organize the
celebrations for the birth of my son

01:26.822 --> 01:28.756
I want them to be
truly spectacular.

01:28.824 --> 01:30.725
- Madam!
- Is it time?

01:30.826 --> 01:33.394
Yes, Your Majesty. [Screaming]

01:33.495 --> 01:36.797
Please, my Lady, don't give up!

01:36.832 --> 01:39.600
Your Majesty may
have to decide soon

01:39.668 --> 01:42.169
between the life of the
mother or of the child.

01:42.237 --> 01:45.006
Her Majesty is delivered

01:45.073 --> 01:46.574
of a healthy son.

01:46.675 --> 01:49.076
- I have a son.
- Right high,

01:49.144 --> 01:51.779
right excellent and
noble Prince Edward.

01:51.847 --> 01:53.981
The Queen's health has
rapidly deteriorated.

01:54.049 --> 01:55.983
We have tried everything we know

01:56.051 --> 01:58.419
but Her Majesty
continues to weaken.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.389
Please, God,
don't take her away from me.

02:04.059 --> 02:07.061
I wonder if Your Majesty could frame
your mind towards a new marriage.

02:07.162 --> 02:10.298
Enemy ships! For Lord's sake,
light the beacon.

02:10.399 --> 02:11.933
Your Majesty is beset by enemies.

02:12.034 --> 02:14.702
Marriage to Anne of
Cleves would bring with it

02:14.736 --> 02:17.805
the military support of
the Protestant League.

02:17.906 --> 02:19.874
Am I to be relieved that once
more I've been used as a pawn

02:19.908 --> 02:21.575
in a game between your
master and the French King?

02:21.710 --> 02:23.544
I've had enough, Mr.. Chapuys.

02:23.645 --> 02:26.380
Allow me to present my companion,
Mr. Thomas Seymour,

02:26.448 --> 02:28.516
<i- >brother of the Queen of England.
Monsieur.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.351
Seems we are threatened
from everywhere, Sir Francis.

02:30.452 --> 02:31.953
Sharpen your knives.

02:32.054 --> 02:33.587
You don't even know
who I am, do you?

02:33.722 --> 02:35.423
You're Edward Seymour's wife.

02:35.524 --> 02:38.726
I thank you, Sir Francis,
in future to leave my wife alone.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.895
I've warned Sir Francis
Bryan to stay away from you.

02:40.963 --> 02:45.232
Well, it's a pity.
He makes me laugh.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.903
Mr.. Holbein has sent this
portrait of Anne of Cleves.

02:49.004 --> 02:50.471
She is pleasing.

02:50.572 --> 02:53.140
Sir John has written
to me in great praise.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.309
I want to possess this woman
and I haven't even seen her.

02:55.410 --> 02:57.378
A great many things hang upon
this marriage, do they not?

02:57.446 --> 02:59.246
What a pity if all should go awry.

02:59.314 --> 03:02.783
I've been deceived
about Anne of Cleves.

03:02.918 --> 03:04.952
She is nothing like
what was reported to me!

03:05.053 --> 03:06.954
SHE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE!

03:07.089 --> 03:09.890
My Lord, if it were not to
satisfy the world and my realm,

03:09.925 --> 03:12.760
I would not do what I must do
this day for no earthly thing.

03:12.828 --> 03:16.263
It seems to me that Lord
Cromwell has overreached himself.

03:16.331 --> 03:18.332
I have found someone
to amuse the King.

03:18.433 --> 03:21.435
Her name is Miss Katherine Howard.

03:21.570 --> 03:24.205
- How old are you, Katherine?
- Seventeen. I was sent to live

03:24.272 --> 03:25.906
in the household of
the Dowager Duchess.

03:25.941 --> 03:28.709
- We ran a little wild.
- What do you think, Your Grace?

03:28.777 --> 03:30.444
I think she looks fit for a King.

03:30.479 --> 03:33.614
My Lord Cromwell,
you are arrested for treason.

03:33.682 --> 03:36.917
[All]: Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

03:36.985 --> 03:38.786
I am no traitor!

03:38.854 --> 03:40.921
As head of Church,
you should find proof

03:40.956 --> 03:42.857
that the marriage was
never consummated.

03:42.924 --> 03:45.326
Send a deputation to Mr.
Cromwell.

03:45.427 --> 03:47.461
Demand of him written evidence
supporting my annulment.

03:47.496 --> 03:49.864
Cromwell will be humiliated.

03:49.965 --> 03:53.200
He was so ambitious
for others' blood.

03:53.301 --> 03:57.271
[Laughing]

03:57.305 --> 04:00.841
[Girl]: Your Majesty...

05:22.391 --> 05:25.360
[Bell chiming]

05:25.428 --> 05:28.096
I must report to the Emperor
that it has not rained

05:28.164 --> 05:31.132
in over two months.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.234
Some say it is the hottest
summer in living memory,

05:33.335 --> 05:35.970
which is a great inconvenience
to the 500 citizens

05:36.038 --> 05:41.509
the King has incarcerated
on charges of heresy.

05:41.577 --> 05:44.779
His Majesty continues to
demonstrate his perversity,

05:44.880 --> 05:47.582
sometimes executing both Lutherans

05:47.683 --> 05:50.885
and Catholics on the same day.

05:51.720 --> 05:57.625
But nothing deters the King
from his amorous pursuits.

05:57.726 --> 06:00.195
I am told he is already
secretly married

06:00.229 --> 06:02.430
to Mistress Katherine
Howard and intends

06:02.531 --> 06:05.567
to show her to the world tomorrow.

06:05.601 --> 06:08.970
- Mr. Culpepper.
- Majesty.

06:10.071 --> 06:14.308
- Lady Rochford.
- Majesty.

06:37.098 --> 06:40.567
Katherine.

07:03.825 --> 07:06.226
Will you not come to bed,

07:06.294 --> 07:12.299
My Lord?

07:12.367 --> 07:15.936
[Indistinct chattering]

07:15.970 --> 07:19.940
[Trumpet call]

07:23.144 --> 07:27.314
The King!

07:29.183 --> 07:32.953
[Laughing]

07:56.678 --> 08:01.882
- My Lady.
- Your Majesty.

08:01.983 --> 08:03.885
Who is that talking to Chapuys?

08:04.986 --> 08:07.188
- Norfolk's eldest son
-the Earl of Surrey.

08:07.323 --> 08:08.757
The Earl's been away a few years,

08:08.791 --> 08:11.660
practicing his chivalry in France.

08:11.794 --> 08:15.197
They say he writes poetry
and runs a little wild.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.138
Your Grace.

08:24.172 --> 08:25.774
Excellency.

08:26.442 --> 08:27.710
Your Grace seems
somewhat distracted.

08:28.478 --> 08:31.045
I was just thinking of
those who are no longer here

08:31.113 --> 08:35.082
to sup with us.
I had a moment of nostalgia

08:35.150 --> 08:38.453
-even for my enemies.
I understand Thomas Boleyn

08:38.554 --> 08:41.154
- died recently.
- Yes. And the only mourners

08:41.256 --> 08:44.925
at his funeral were the
ghosts of his children.

08:44.993 --> 08:49.563
Your Grace, Ambassador Chapuys.

08:49.597 --> 08:53.166
Monsieur Marillac, we are
happy accept your credentials

08:53.268 --> 08:55.402
from King Francis.
Welcome to our Court.

08:55.436 --> 08:58.606
I come here this day to
introduce to you my new wife,

08:58.674 --> 09:02.010
Queen Katherine.
I was first attracted to her

09:02.111 --> 09:04.345
by a notable appearance of honour,

09:04.446 --> 09:07.849
cleanness...

09:07.950 --> 09:10.785
and maidenly behaviour...

09:10.819 --> 09:13.922
It seems incredible to have
obtained such a perfect jewel

09:13.956 --> 09:19.994
of womanhood who bears
towards me such perfect love.

09:20.095 --> 09:24.198
A love that will not only bring
me the peace and tranquility

09:24.300 --> 09:26.668
I desire, but may also bring forth

09:26.769 --> 09:32.607
the desired fruits
of such a marriage.

09:37.613 --> 09:39.547
- To Queen Katherine.
- [All]: Queen Katherine!

09:39.648 --> 09:45.153
[Applause]

09:45.220 --> 09:50.692
Now, let's eat! I'm starving!

09:50.759 --> 09:56.798
[Applause continues]

10:12.314 --> 10:15.416
Your Majesty, may I
introduce the Earl of Surrey.

10:15.517 --> 10:19.153
We are very glad
to welcome you back

10:19.188 --> 10:22.523
- at court, my Lord Surrey.
- Majesty.

10:22.558 --> 10:25.526
Allow me to
introduce my new wife.

10:25.594 --> 10:28.863
- And my niece, I believe.
- My Lord.

10:28.998 --> 10:30.765
Sorry.

10:30.866 --> 10:37.105
Majesty.

10:38.774 --> 10:42.610
So, you are the new
French ambassador.

10:42.711 --> 10:45.780
Tell me, Monsieur Marillac:
what did your King really say

10:45.881 --> 10:49.717
when you told him His Majesty
had got rid of his last Queen?

10:49.752 --> 10:52.887
Well, he didn't say much.

10:52.921 --> 10:58.593
He just sighed very deeply
and then he said: "Ah!"

11:09.071 --> 11:11.406
Would you like to dance?

11:11.473 --> 11:13.408
Go on.

11:13.475 --> 11:17.779
Wait. Charles.

11:24.486 --> 11:28.322
- [Applause]
- Bravo!

11:28.424 --> 11:35.930
[Orchestra]

11:42.805 --> 11:44.405
Monsieur Marillac.

11:46.241 --> 11:48.743
Majesty.

11:48.811 --> 11:51.546
Tell your master I was very
sad to hear about the death

11:51.613 --> 11:53.548
of the Dauphin, his eldest son.

11:53.615 --> 11:57.118
Majesty.

11:57.219 --> 11:59.320
His Majesty would like
to propose a marriage

11:59.421 --> 12:02.757
between his second son,
Henri, Duke of Orleans,

12:02.891 --> 12:05.960
and your daughter, the Lady Mary.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.262
How often it comes around.

12:09.832 --> 12:13.267
- Pardon?
- Forgive me.

12:13.302 --> 12:15.603
You're new to all of this.

12:19.341 --> 12:22.343
Do you know how old she is?

12:22.444 --> 12:25.980
Seventeen.

12:26.115 --> 12:30.118
Have you told your
master about her?

12:30.185 --> 12:34.322
What does he say?

12:34.423 --> 12:37.925
I suppose he thinks I'm mad.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.129
[Laughs]

12:41.196 --> 12:44.532
Or else he's just plain jealous.

13:04.653 --> 13:10.258
[Applause]

13:10.325 --> 13:12.093
<i- >[Bell chiming] - Come here,
ladies!

13:12.161 --> 13:14.095
<i>Come and look at this!</i>

13:14.163 --> 13:17.431
The King sent it
to me this morning.

13:17.499 --> 13:23.471
[Giggling]

13:23.539 --> 13:27.508
Now, ladies...

13:27.609 --> 13:30.678
You must promise that from now on,
as you are all sworn in,

13:30.779 --> 13:34.048
you will all dress in the
French fashion, like me.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.050
Do you promise?

13:36.151 --> 13:38.452
Yes, Your Majesty!

13:38.520 --> 13:41.989
We are more than happy
to oblige Your Majesty.

13:42.024 --> 13:44.625
[Giggling]

13:44.693 --> 13:46.627
Lady Rochford.

13:46.695 --> 13:50.698
My Lady. You have a letter,
just delivered.

13:59.074 --> 14:01.509
What is it?

14:01.577 --> 14:04.478
Oh, nothing. Just an old friend,
Joan Bulmer.

14:04.546 --> 14:07.181
She says that she has heard
of my "great destiny"

14:07.249 --> 14:10.017
and will I please now
send for her to court.

14:10.052 --> 14:12.854
She says that some
altered circumstances

14:12.921 --> 14:16.424
have brought her "to the
utmost misery in the world

14:16.525 --> 14:19.694
and a most wretched life."

14:22.598 --> 14:27.602
Shall you send for her?

14:27.703 --> 14:30.371
I shall think on it,
Lady Rochford.

14:30.439 --> 14:35.710
Now, ladies, why don't we
try on your new dresses!

14:35.777 --> 14:38.212
Yes, madam! [Giggling]

14:38.280 --> 14:41.782
<i>I'll tell you another amusing
thing about the French.</i>

14:41.884 --> 14:44.385
To celebrate the winter
solstice in Paris,

14:44.419 --> 14:48.256
they build a bonfire and on the
top of it they put a barrel,

14:48.390 --> 14:52.727
a wheel, garlands, and a basket
filled with two dozen cats

14:52.861 --> 14:57.198
and a fox to be burned alive
for the King's pleasure!

14:57.232 --> 15:00.101
I actually saw King Francis himself

15:00.202 --> 15:04.572
light it with a torch
wrapped in red velvet.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.574
Of course!

15:06.642 --> 15:09.043
Tell me, my Lord Surrey,
after so long away,

15:09.077 --> 15:10.978
how do you find the English court?

15:11.079 --> 15:15.016
I find it full of mean creatures.

15:15.083 --> 15:18.286
Many of them in the
service of His Majesty.

15:18.353 --> 15:22.623
- Of whom do you speak?
- Those men of vile birth:

15:22.758 --> 15:28.729
lawyers, university men,
Machiavellian intriguers

15:28.830 --> 15:30.932
whose only desire
is the destruction

15:30.999 --> 15:36.203
of the nobility of this country.
And I hate them all.

15:36.305 --> 15:38.406
You mean men like the Seymours?

15:38.473 --> 15:41.175
One cannot forget their
sister provided the King

15:41.276 --> 15:45.479
with an heir to the throne.

15:48.784 --> 15:53.754
And now that you've returned,
what are your ambitions?

15:53.822 --> 15:57.091
To surpass the achievements
of my father and my grandfather.

15:57.159 --> 16:00.561
That is a very high
ambition, my Lord.

16:00.629 --> 16:05.933
I'm a Howard.
It is expected of me.

16:05.968 --> 16:11.605
And always has been.
And I will not fail.

16:14.676 --> 16:19.213
- [Man]: Any deer?
- No deer!

16:19.314 --> 16:21.782
Majesty, you've caught nothing all day,
beyond some rabbits

16:21.817 --> 16:24.485
and a deer,
but you're still smiling.

16:24.619 --> 16:28.322
Have I not every reason to be happy?
You have seen the Queen.

16:28.390 --> 16:31.959
Shouldn't the man that that woman
gives herself to always be happy?

16:31.994 --> 16:36.964
I'd say he'd be beyond happiness, Majesty.
In a higher state altogether.

16:36.999 --> 16:40.968
I feel almost like
a new man, Charles.

16:41.036 --> 16:44.338
I am no longer vexed by the
things that before vexed me daily.

16:44.439 --> 16:49.343
And even my leg is beginning to heal.
Sex is a great medicine.

16:49.378 --> 16:52.046
Indeed. You are very fortunate.

16:52.147 --> 16:54.982
How is your Catherine?

16:55.017 --> 16:57.351
She is well.

16:57.419 --> 17:00.588
Although she no longer
loves me as she once did.

17:00.689 --> 17:03.324
- We live mostly apart.
- Take a mistress.

17:03.358 --> 17:07.361
I would rather make her
love me again, if I could.

17:07.429 --> 17:09.530
I want to take the
Queen on a visit soon.

17:09.598 --> 17:11.766
I want the people to
see her as I see her.

17:11.867 --> 17:15.236
- Majesty.
- And her kinsman, Lord Surrey.

17:15.303 --> 17:17.872
I want to make him a cupbearer,

17:17.939 --> 17:19.973
and give him other
tokens of our esteem.

17:20.041 --> 17:23.010
I am sure His Lordship
will be most grateful.

17:23.045 --> 17:26.680
No, my Lord. He will merely
see it as his birthright!

17:26.781 --> 17:29.717
Master Culpepper! Come on, boy!

17:29.785 --> 17:31.552
Have them flush us
out something edible!

17:31.686 --> 17:33.387
Yes, Majesty. Beaters!

17:33.522 --> 17:35.823
Yah! Yah!

17:44.733 --> 17:49.937
Majesty. The Lady Mary.
[Takes a nervous breath]

17:55.777 --> 17:58.946
Lady Mary.

17:59.047 --> 18:02.550
Madam.

18:02.617 --> 18:06.854
It gives me such
pleasure to meet you.

18:13.762 --> 18:17.098
The King talks about you often.
No, all the time.

18:17.199 --> 18:19.567
With such affection...

18:24.206 --> 18:30.211
It is my dearest wish that you
and I may be kind and loving...

18:30.245 --> 18:34.215
and warm to each other...

18:34.282 --> 18:39.553
After all, Lady Mary,
you are now my stepdaughter.

18:47.062 --> 18:50.231
I shall attend upon Your Majesty

18:50.265 --> 18:52.867
whenever Your Majesty
chooses to invite me.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.236
Thank you.

18:58.440 --> 19:02.576
Will you stay a while?
My maids have made some cakes.

19:02.644 --> 19:06.180
No, thank ywu.

19:06.248 --> 19:10.684
I bid you a good day.

19:10.752 --> 19:14.088
Madam.

19:23.965 --> 19:26.367
[Clears throat]

19:26.401 --> 19:29.737
Your old friend is here:
Miss Joan Bulmer.

19:37.111 --> 19:39.913
Katherine!

19:43.751 --> 19:45.552
Are you not the luckiest,

19:45.686 --> 19:47.620
most fortunate woman
in all the world?

19:47.722 --> 19:51.124
- Joan, I-
- Are you not pleased to see me?

19:51.225 --> 19:54.561
Of course I'm pleased.

19:54.595 --> 19:58.732
We used to be so close,
didn't we? You know the unfeigned love

19:58.766 --> 20:03.103
my heart has always
borne towards you.

20:03.237 --> 20:06.406
You are going to give me
a position, I presume?

20:06.474 --> 20:09.442
I may. But you must understand-

20:09.577 --> 20:13.113
Otherwise I must persist
in my wretchedness.

20:13.180 --> 20:15.582
In my misery.

20:15.616 --> 20:18.184
Say you will not turn me away.

20:18.252 --> 20:21.287
[Sighs]

20:31.365 --> 20:34.134
Do you remember when
you-know-who used to come in,

20:34.201 --> 20:36.202
late at night... and slip into bed?

20:36.270 --> 20:41.641
For God's sake,
be careful what you say.

20:45.780 --> 20:48.882
But you will make me one
of your ladies, won't you?

20:48.949 --> 20:50.850
Sweet Katherine?

20:54.723 --> 20:57.091
My Lords, there are new reports

20:57.192 --> 21:00.060
of disturbances in France. Sit.

21:02.731 --> 21:06.133
There is a quarrel between
the French garrison at Ardres

21:06.234 --> 21:08.135
and our own at Guisnes.

21:08.236 --> 21:12.239
The French built a castle at Ardres

21:12.274 --> 21:15.376
and then a bridge into
the Pale of Calais.

21:15.443 --> 21:18.145
When our soldiers pulled
it down, the French

21:18.246 --> 21:21.749
promptly rebuilt it.
Now, I mean to show these French

21:21.816 --> 21:25.719
that I will not shy away
from battle if I am provoked!

21:25.820 --> 21:27.421
For reasons which I am sending Tom
Seymour and the Earl of Surrey to Calais.

21:29.155 --> 21:33.025
They will bring with
them from the garrison,

21:33.126 --> 21:38.597
men and ordnance and they will
make a show of force before Ardres.

21:38.632 --> 21:41.433
In which case the French must
either decide to desist...

21:41.568 --> 21:43.435
or fight.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.938
[All]: Aye.

21:45.972 --> 21:51.510
[Indistinct chattering]

21:51.611 --> 21:55.114
[All giggling]

21:57.785 --> 22:00.019
- It's raining roses!
- My Lady.

22:00.120 --> 22:05.291
Mr.. Thomas Culpepper is here.

22:05.359 --> 22:08.127
Mr.. Culpepper.

22:08.262 --> 22:11.097
Your Majesty.
The King has sent me.

22:11.165 --> 22:13.032
Come.

22:28.315 --> 22:30.383
Mr. Culpepper?

22:31.719 --> 22:34.387
His Majesty wants you to
know that you will shortly

22:34.488 --> 22:36.389
accompany him on a visit to
Sir William Paget's estates

22:36.490 --> 22:40.393
in Berkshire for your
pastime and disport.

22:40.494 --> 22:42.495
I am very grateful to His Majesty

22:42.563 --> 22:44.664
and I look forward to
the visit very much.

22:44.799 --> 22:46.499
His Majesty also wants you
to know that he has settled

22:46.534 --> 22:48.501
Baynard's Castle on
you as your jointure.

22:48.536 --> 22:52.138
Where is Baynard's Castle?

22:52.206 --> 22:54.841
It is here in London,
on the north bank of the Thames,

22:54.875 --> 22:57.377
near the Fleet Tower. You've
probably seen it from the river.

22:57.478 --> 22:59.479
Is it that big one?

22:59.513 --> 23:01.715
Yes. It's a very big one.

23:01.816 --> 23:04.384
- [Giggles]
- In that case...

23:04.518 --> 23:08.154
please tell His Majesty that I am very,
very grateful to him.

23:08.222 --> 23:11.891
I cannot imagine owning a castle.

23:11.993 --> 23:14.327
Majesty.

23:14.362 --> 23:17.564
May I commend your Majesty
on taking decisive action

23:17.698 --> 23:20.567
against the French and
for honouring my brother

23:20.668 --> 23:22.569
with a command. I know he
will not fail in his duty...

23:22.703 --> 23:26.039
<i>His Majesty also desires you
to accept this gift.</i>

23:32.713 --> 23:35.715
Please tell His Majesty that--

23:35.783 --> 23:38.785
That you're very,
very, very grateful.

23:38.886 --> 23:42.522
Yes.

23:57.438 --> 24:03.309
I do not know who to say this to,
Mr.. Culpepper.

24:03.411 --> 24:06.946
But, when I go about,

24:07.048 --> 24:10.950
and when I shall go with
the King on a visit,

24:11.052 --> 24:12.986
I am...

24:13.054 --> 24:18.091
not so used to
everyone looking at me.

24:18.159 --> 24:23.730
And sometimes wish
they would not do.

24:23.831 --> 24:27.100
My Lady, you must
give men leave to look,

24:27.134 --> 24:29.235
for they will look upon you.

24:33.107 --> 24:37.110
There is no help for it.

24:42.283 --> 24:44.684
Your Majesty.

24:48.622 --> 24:52.092
Lady Rochford.

24:53.928 --> 24:56.629
[All giggling and laughing]

24:56.664 --> 25:02.435
[Humming]

25:02.470 --> 25:05.338
Your Majesty.

25:05.473 --> 25:06.706
Hello, my Lady.

25:06.807 --> 25:11.878
I love you. Kiss me.

25:11.979 --> 25:14.814
No! He-he-he!

25:14.849 --> 25:17.150
Please kiss me.

25:17.284 --> 25:19.152
Well, all right then.

25:19.286 --> 25:24.124
[Laughs]

25:24.191 --> 25:29.863
[Both laughing]

25:29.964 --> 25:33.633
Come here.

25:33.667 --> 25:37.170
Oh, oh, my Lady! Oh, my Queen!

25:37.204 --> 25:40.306
Oh, Your Majesty! [Laughing]

27:05.192 --> 27:12.732
[Moaning softly]

27:22.243 --> 27:25.645
I'm going away for a while.

27:25.746 --> 27:27.981
Mr. Risley will supply
you with an itinerary.

27:28.082 --> 27:30.283
Yes, Your Majesty.

27:30.417 --> 27:33.386
While I'm away I intend to
call a meeting of the Council.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.589
Every Councillor must attend or give
very good reason why he may not.

27:36.624 --> 27:38.825
- Majesty.
- That's the agenda.

27:38.926 --> 27:43.396
Also, while we're away I
intend for work to begin

27:43.464 --> 27:45.598
on the improvements to the palace.

27:45.633 --> 27:49.569
There will be a new front
along the east river,

27:49.603 --> 27:52.105
privy lodgings for the Lady Mary,

27:52.139 --> 27:54.107
and a banqueting house.

27:54.141 --> 27:57.277
[Sighs deeply]

27:57.344 --> 27:59.245
Damn this heat...

27:59.313 --> 28:01.781
Pardon, Your Majesty?

28:05.485 --> 28:10.189
Tell me, my Lord,
who is presently kept in the Tower?

28:10.290 --> 28:14.093
[Sighs again]

28:14.961 --> 28:19.799
There is Lord Grey, accused
of grave misconduct in Ireland;

28:19.833 --> 28:23.435
Lord Lisle, the same but in Calais;
and Sir John Neville,

28:23.470 --> 28:26.939
who led, as you may remember,
Your Majesty,

28:27.007 --> 28:30.309
the recent disturbance in the north,
for which he has

28:30.410 --> 28:33.078
been arraigned. Theris also
one other of high birth,

28:33.146 --> 28:36.749
namely the queen's cousin,
Lord Dacres.

28:38.919 --> 28:41.821
For what crime?

28:41.922 --> 28:45.591
Your Majesty, Lord Dacres
is a young man of 23 years,

28:45.625 --> 28:49.662
who, along with some companions,
and after a drinking bout,

28:49.763 --> 28:53.766
set upon an old man in
a brawl and killed him.

28:53.834 --> 28:56.468
His father and other
members of his family

28:56.536 --> 28:58.637
have written to Your
Majesty begging you,

28:58.705 --> 29:02.308
for the sake of his youth,
to show mercy.

29:04.177 --> 29:06.812
The first three are to be
executed whilst I'm away.

29:08.982 --> 29:12.651
Lord Dacres is different.

29:12.752 --> 29:16.622
He has besmirched his noble birth

29:16.690 --> 29:19.859
by behaving like a common criminal.

29:19.960 --> 29:23.963
And so I intend he shall
be treated like one.

29:23.997 --> 29:26.699
Have him dragged through
the streets to Tyburn

29:26.766 --> 29:30.469
and there hanged in public,
for all to see.

29:30.604 --> 29:33.439
Yes, Your Majesty.

29:33.506 --> 29:36.842
[Sighs again]

29:38.879 --> 29:43.148
For God's sakes,
will it ever rain?

29:43.183 --> 29:48.053
Lady Hertford,
the Earl of Surrey, my Lady.

29:57.463 --> 30:01.800
My Lord. How may
I be of assistance?

30:01.935 --> 30:06.638
I rather trusted to
find the Earl here.

30:06.673 --> 30:09.942
I am leaving presently for France.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.677
He is a military man.
I wanted some advice.

30:11.778 --> 30:16.448
My husband is in
council with the King.

30:23.523 --> 30:28.527
Soneone of my acquaintance
has told me about you,

30:28.661 --> 30:34.900
painting such a picture of
your virtues and your talents

30:35.001 --> 30:39.905
that I thought to make
myself known to you.

30:40.006 --> 30:43.275
I am recently returned from France

30:43.376 --> 30:48.513
and I know intimately
so few people at court.

30:52.151 --> 30:56.421
Well, Sir, now we are introduced.

31:01.094 --> 31:04.496
If that is what you wanted?

31:17.610 --> 31:22.681
I will tell my husband that
you wish to speak to him.

31:22.749 --> 31:26.385
Thank you.

31:29.222 --> 31:33.759
My Lady.

31:37.797 --> 31:40.732
Sir Edward!

31:40.800 --> 31:44.403
These shoes must be nicely put
and always carefully attended.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.705
Yes, my Lady.

31:46.773 --> 31:51.310
Your Majesty, the King is here!

31:51.411 --> 31:54.246
Oh my!

31:58.418 --> 32:01.286
Sweetheart,

32:01.387 --> 32:03.288
there are two people come
to be introduced to you.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.425
- Lady Bryan.
- Your Majesty.

32:06.459 --> 32:09.428
This is my son, Prince Edward.

32:09.462 --> 32:11.430
Come forward, child.

32:11.464 --> 32:14.466
This is my new Queen, Katherine.

32:14.567 --> 32:18.437
- Say hello to her.
- Hello, Your Majesty.

32:18.471 --> 32:22.674
Oh, he's such a sweet boy!

32:22.775 --> 32:24.843
Hello, Your Grace.

32:24.944 --> 32:27.312
- I am so delighted to meet you.
- Thank you.

32:27.413 --> 32:32.017
Is he well? Eating well?
How does the heat affect him?

32:32.118 --> 32:33.685
Even though it is so hot he
must always be wrapped up

32:33.753 --> 32:35.554
- against any sudden chills.
- He is very well and healthy,

32:35.621 --> 32:38.657
and every care that could be taken
is taken for his better comfort.

32:38.758 --> 32:42.861
On the other hand,
don't spoil him too much!

32:42.962 --> 32:45.263
[Edward laughing]

32:45.298 --> 32:48.266
Go on.

32:48.301 --> 32:50.135
And be a good boy, do you hear?

32:50.269 --> 32:53.839
Thank you, sir. Good day, Madam.

33:02.982 --> 33:06.017
Welcome, Elizabeth.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.389
This is my daughter,

33:10.490 --> 33:12.858
the Lady Elizabeth.

33:13.693 --> 33:17.863
Your Majesty, I am honoured
to be presented to you

33:17.997 --> 33:20.232
and wish you every
joy and happiness.

33:20.333 --> 33:25.637
It is also an honour for me
to meet you, Lady Elizabeth.

33:25.705 --> 33:29.474
You are a very pretty young lady.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.243
Thank you, Madam.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.513
I want to give you these.

33:36.516 --> 33:41.052
They are of not much value,
but will remind you of me.

33:41.154 --> 33:43.188
Your Majesty is very generous.

33:43.222 --> 33:47.692
I will always cherish it.
Your Majesty.

34:02.909 --> 34:05.911
Carry on packing;
we depart tomorrow.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.847
Madam.

34:11.818 --> 34:16.088
[Bell chiming]

34:16.121 --> 34:18.090
Now, Mr. Risley.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.257
The death warrants,
my Lord Hertford.

34:20.293 --> 34:22.460
My Lord.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.763
Lord Grey.

34:24.797 --> 34:28.367
Lord Lisle. Sir John Neville.

34:28.467 --> 34:31.803
And Lord Dacres.

34:32.972 --> 34:36.274
I pity him for his youth.

34:36.309 --> 34:39.543
They say the judges wept
when they read his sentence.

34:39.645 --> 34:44.349
God save us, Mr.
Risley, from weeping judges.

34:48.987 --> 34:52.357
My Lord.

34:56.329 --> 34:59.931
Did Surrey speak to
you before he left?

35:00.032 --> 35:01.933
No. Since his return

35:02.034 --> 35:04.503
the Earl has made it plain
to all who will listen

35:04.537 --> 35:07.572
that he despises us as "new men."

35:07.673 --> 35:11.576
I don't suppose that
he would deal with you?

35:11.711 --> 35:15.213
Perhaps.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.383
Why is it so important?

35:18.451 --> 35:21.720
Surrey is heir to a great
title and a great fortune.

35:21.754 --> 35:25.056
His family have royal blood.

35:25.091 --> 35:29.261
Surely even you can see the
merits of dealing with him.

35:53.085 --> 35:57.088
?

35:59.058 --> 36:06.431
?

36:06.466 --> 36:08.733
Sir William?

36:08.801 --> 36:12.504
The Queen and I thank you for
your most lavish hospitality.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.406
Oh, Your Majesty
is most gracious.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.142
We are so honoured that you and
your Queen have chosen to visit us.

36:26.819 --> 36:30.922
?

36:30.990 --> 36:33.992
Sir Richard.

36:34.126 --> 36:36.761
Your Majesty.
I just came from court.

36:36.829 --> 36:39.464
We have had news from France.

36:43.836 --> 36:47.172
Apparently, soon after I arrived,
Sir Thomas Seymour

36:47.273 --> 36:49.174
and Lord Surrey,
as you commanded, made warlike

36:49.275 --> 36:51.176
preparations and
showed their strength,

36:51.277 --> 36:53.311
and afterwards made overtures
to the French governor.

36:53.379 --> 36:56.448
Some gifts were exchanged and
the French were invited to watch

36:56.482 --> 36:58.884
a wrestling match. And where,

36:58.985 --> 37:00.852
until recently, nothing but war

37:00.920 --> 37:04.656
had been talked of,
now there is no mention

37:04.724 --> 37:08.193
but of wishing to live at peace.

37:08.294 --> 37:11.296
Then it was all well done.

37:11.364 --> 37:14.232
And yet, Sir Richard,
something inside me is disappointed.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.302
It hungers for a war.

37:17.403 --> 37:20.005
I have known its mad
excitements only once,

37:20.072 --> 37:23.275
that was a long time ago.

37:23.376 --> 37:26.244
Funny. You know, I actually thought

37:26.345 --> 37:29.514
the French might
oblige me this time.

37:31.317 --> 37:35.921
Majesty.

37:49.735 --> 37:54.205
[Laughing]

38:31.410 --> 38:33.945
Are you happy?

38:34.080 --> 38:37.849
Do you have everything you want,
everything you need?

38:37.883 --> 38:42.220
- Tell me.
- Yes, everything.

38:48.027 --> 38:50.729
There is one thing.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.231
What is it?

38:53.299 --> 38:57.235
It's just that...

38:57.303 --> 39:00.238
the Lady Mary doesn't
treat me with respect.

39:00.306 --> 39:03.875
And I think she ought to,
don't you?

39:03.909 --> 39:06.911
She will. Believe me.

39:07.046 --> 39:10.281
Give her time.

39:10.416 --> 39:13.218
All this is new to her,

39:13.285 --> 39:15.987
but she will grow used to you.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.590
And then she will love you.

39:18.658 --> 39:22.160
I hope so.

39:30.236 --> 39:33.938
Katherine, Katherine.

39:34.006 --> 39:37.175
I'm tired. I'm very tired.

39:37.276 --> 39:40.111
I have a long day tomorrow.

39:40.246 --> 39:43.014
[Giggling]

39:45.084 --> 39:48.953
Good night, sweetheart.

39:51.624 --> 39:54.859
Sleep well.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.870
Good night, Your Majesty.

40:07.006 --> 40:10.508
Good night, my Lady.

40:20.720 --> 40:25.390
[Exhales deeply]

40:32.665 --> 40:37.002
- [Giggles]
- Joan!

40:37.036 --> 40:40.372
- What is it?
- Don't worry. I won't stay.

40:40.473 --> 40:43.542
- I just want to talk.
- About what?

40:46.512 --> 40:51.016
This is how it used to be.
Remember? You and me together.

40:51.084 --> 40:55.587
I told you to mind what you say.

40:55.688 --> 40:59.191
I'm only talking to you.

41:05.331 --> 41:09.701
And then the two of
them would come in,

41:09.769 --> 41:13.205
the one for you,
and the other mine.

41:13.273 --> 41:17.542
And all that puffing and
blowing in the dark.

41:17.610 --> 41:20.579
And you and him รณ?uld kiss

41:20.713 --> 41:22.581
and hang by your bellies
like two sparrows.

41:22.715 --> 41:25.284
There was no harm in it.

41:25.385 --> 41:28.654
We were agreed we
were to be married.

41:28.721 --> 41:31.390
Is that what you told the King?

41:31.524 --> 41:33.392
Don't be stupid.

41:33.459 --> 41:36.528
I don't need to tell
him anything about...

41:36.562 --> 41:39.264
what happened before.

41:39.365 --> 41:42.467
And if you talk of it
to anyone I swear I'll--

41:42.568 --> 41:44.469
Hush. Hush. Do you suppose

41:44.570 --> 41:47.339
I don't like being at court,
like a special person?

41:47.407 --> 41:50.942
Then swear on your honour,
and hope to die,

41:51.044 --> 41:53.879
that you will speak
of it to nobody,

41:53.946 --> 41:56.748
not even any of my other ladies.

41:56.816 --> 41:59.117
Yes, Your Majesty.

42:03.222 --> 42:06.091
I do so swear.

42:07.760 --> 42:12.331
Honestly.

42:12.432 --> 42:17.302
Good. Now go back to bed.

42:36.689 --> 42:40.325
And do you remember this?

42:40.460 --> 42:42.794
[Giggles]

42:46.466 --> 42:50.435
I am Queen now.

42:50.470 --> 42:53.338
Do as I command.

42:53.439 --> 42:55.340
[Both giggling]

42:55.441 --> 42:57.042
[Laughing]

42:57.143 --> 42:59.811
How very obliging of Sir William

42:59.846 --> 43:02.681
- to open his cellar for us.
- I rather thought, Sir Edward,

43:02.815 --> 43:05.450
- that it was you who opened it.
- Well, I was thirsty!

43:05.518 --> 43:08.653
I still am! [Laughing]

43:08.688 --> 43:11.323
- By God she's wanton.
- Who is?

43:11.457 --> 43:13.325
You know very well who I mean.

43:13.459 --> 43:15.327
Queen Katherine.
She's a little fireball.

43:15.461 --> 43:17.329
Too hot for you, Mr. Culpepper.

43:17.463 --> 43:22.267
- [Laughing]
- Really?

43:22.368 --> 43:24.870
Uh-huh.

43:26.205 --> 43:30.709
Tell me you can't imagine
her without her clothes on.

43:32.211 --> 43:34.112
Just picture her naked body.

43:34.180 --> 43:36.581
Those breasts.

43:36.649 --> 43:42.187
Those thighs. That sweet
plump little arse.

43:46.692 --> 43:50.228
Holy Jesus.

43:50.329 --> 43:54.633
All those things
belong to the King.

44:06.212 --> 44:10.449
I bid you gentlemen good night.

44:10.550 --> 44:14.653
And if I were you,

44:14.754 --> 44:19.624
I would not outstay your welcome
in Sir William's kitchen.

44:24.630 --> 44:28.733
I can't drink enough to
banish the thoughts of her.

44:28.768 --> 44:31.736
Tomorrow let's go out
and find something

44:31.804 --> 44:34.606
to quench that thirst. [Cheering]

45:13.913 --> 45:20.585
- Ya!
- Ya!

45:30.363 --> 45:32.764
- Ho there!
- Sir, a good day.

45:32.798 --> 45:34.666
And to you. And who are you?

45:34.767 --> 45:38.436
The wife of the park-keeper, sir.

45:38.504 --> 45:41.606
- And where is your husband?
- He's away at a fair, sir.

45:43.142 --> 45:45.377
Anyone else here? Your children?

45:45.478 --> 45:47.379
No, sir.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.316
I had a daughter, sir, but she died.
There's no one else here.

45:53.986 --> 45:56.621
Can I help you, sir?

45:59.792 --> 46:04.696
You can do me a great favour,
and it will please you too.

46:04.797 --> 46:06.197
Oh no, sir!

46:06.299 --> 46:09.000
Do you know who I am?

46:09.035 --> 46:12.404
A gentleman of the Privy Chamber.
I serve the King.

46:14.340 --> 46:17.342
- Now, let's go inside.
- No!

46:17.443 --> 46:20.979
If, as you say,
you are a gentleman,

46:21.047 --> 46:23.682
then you would not try to
force me against my will.

46:23.716 --> 46:27.519
You would just leave,
as I ask you to.

46:27.620 --> 46:32.991
[Crying nervously]

46:33.025 --> 46:36.595
- Come on!
- This way!

46:36.696 --> 46:39.497
Around back!

46:39.599 --> 46:43.335
Come on, little chicken!

46:43.369 --> 46:47.072
[Laughing]

46:47.206 --> 46:50.875
- [Woman screaming]
- Come on, boys!

46:51.010 --> 46:53.612
- Leave me alone!
- Look at her run!

46:53.713 --> 46:58.416
- Hey! You'll enjoy it!
- Take her!

46:58.551 --> 47:03.221
- [Chuckling]
- Come on now. Easy.

47:03.289 --> 47:06.191
Hold her still.

47:08.194 --> 47:14.265
[Giggling and laughing]

47:20.006 --> 47:23.074
[Laughing]

47:23.142 --> 47:25.977
Who are you, there?

47:26.078 --> 47:29.614
Mr. Roper, sir. The park-keeper.

47:29.749 --> 47:33.585
Mr. Roper.

47:33.653 --> 47:35.987
What on earth do you want with me?

47:36.122 --> 47:38.957
You know very well
what I want, sir.

47:39.058 --> 47:43.261
I want justice.
I know what you've done.

47:43.396 --> 47:46.765
I have come to take
you to the Sheriff.

47:46.832 --> 47:48.933
- Come, sir.
- Don't you dare touch me.

47:49.001 --> 47:52.270
You should know your betters.

47:52.405 --> 47:55.407
Now go back to your pigsty.

47:55.441 --> 47:58.343
I will go, sir,

47:58.444 --> 48:01.012
and fetch the Sheriff myself,

48:01.080 --> 48:04.816
whose justice is better than yours!

48:04.950 --> 48:09.621
I would rather not
trouble the Sheriff.

48:09.755 --> 48:12.357
How much do you want
for your silence?

48:12.458 --> 48:15.593
Come on, man.

48:15.628 --> 48:17.696
What real harm was done?

48:17.797 --> 48:20.765
Take a gold crown,

48:20.833 --> 48:23.601
enough to buy a dozen pigs,
and forget the whole matter.

48:23.636 --> 48:27.005
No, sir. For the shame
would still be there

48:27.073 --> 48:31.476
in my wife's eyes. And in my soul.

48:50.663 --> 48:54.499
Damn you for a fool.

49:12.218 --> 49:14.686
I have to say I was
surprised at your invitation.

49:14.754 --> 49:17.222
Really?

49:17.356 --> 49:22.560
I had imagined that very little
would surprise you, my Lord.

49:22.695 --> 49:27.031
It is true that I have
seen most things in my life.

49:27.066 --> 49:29.901
But I find that people

49:29.969 --> 49:33.037
can always be surprising.

49:33.105 --> 49:36.941
I invited you here because
I want us to be friends.

49:39.545 --> 49:42.680
What kind of friends?

49:42.715 --> 49:47.285
Good friends.

49:52.358 --> 49:56.094
Who wants to be cursed?

49:56.195 --> 50:01.566
People are good when
they are afraid.

50:01.634 --> 50:06.404
When they are not afraid...

50:06.472 --> 50:10.575
they can be anything.

50:10.709 --> 50:14.078
I am not afraid.

50:14.146 --> 50:17.582
I will never be afraid.

50:20.820 --> 50:24.255
[Women laughing and giggling]

50:37.903 --> 50:41.139
[Continues]

50:53.285 --> 50:55.320
[Laughing and screaming]

51:04.630 --> 51:06.564
Katherine Howard!

51:06.632 --> 51:11.469
Your Majesty!

51:11.537 --> 51:14.806
[Laughing]

51:24.884 --> 51:27.218
My Councillors are arriving.

51:30.289 --> 51:32.357
Oh, then I'd better wash.

51:32.491 --> 51:36.361
Yes. [Laughing]

51:39.665 --> 51:43.534
[Girls laughing]

51:50.843 --> 51:53.177
[Bursts out laughing]

51:53.312 --> 51:57.015
[Girls giggling]

51:57.149 --> 51:59.717
Gentlemen. My Lords.

51:59.852 --> 52:02.687
[Chattering]

52:02.721 --> 52:04.322
What is your report,
my Lord Hertford?

52:04.356 --> 52:06.891
Your Majesty, there was
a small outbreak of plague

52:06.992 --> 52:09.861
in the city during your absence,
which now has abated, thank God.

52:09.895 --> 52:13.097
The building works Your Majesty
requested have all commenced.

52:13.198 --> 52:15.566
And the executions of Lords Grey and Lisle,
of Sir John Neville

52:15.701 --> 52:17.568
and Lord Dacres have
all been carried out

52:17.703 --> 52:20.672
in accordance with
Your Majesty's wishes.

52:20.739 --> 52:22.740
Sit.

52:25.277 --> 52:27.078
My Lords.

52:27.179 --> 52:31.115
I refer to the 500 men kept in
prison on suspicion of heresy.

52:31.216 --> 52:35.053
It is my desire that they should
be pardoned and therefore released.

52:36.789 --> 52:39.457
Your Majesty shows
remarkable charity.

52:39.558 --> 52:44.395
Why should I not?
Does our Lord not commend us

52:44.463 --> 52:48.566
to never to let mercy and
faithfulness depart from us?

52:48.701 --> 52:51.703
How is my boy?

52:51.770 --> 52:55.206
Prince Edward is very well,
Your Majesty.

52:55.240 --> 53:00.578
King Francis has formally
proposed a marriage contract

53:00.646 --> 53:04.949
between his son, Henri,
Duc of Orleans, and Lady Mary.

53:05.084 --> 53:07.318
We do not, and cannot,

53:07.419 --> 53:10.488
trust the intentions of King
Francis and still think he means

53:10.589 --> 53:12.290
- to invade this realm.
- [All]: Aye.

53:12.391 --> 53:16.127
Events at Calais were just a
preliminary exercise to test

53:16.261 --> 53:19.063
our resolve. In which case
we must continue to look

53:19.098 --> 53:21.132
to our coastal defences
and favour the Emperor.

53:24.236 --> 53:26.137
Now, to the subject
of Queen Katherine.

53:27.171 --> 53:30.307
It is my intention to settle
upon her all the lands

53:30.341 --> 53:32.976
and manors which formerly
belonged to Jane Seymour.

53:33.044 --> 53:38.448
Furthermore, some lands and
properties formerly in the

53:38.549 --> 53:41.218
possession of Thomas Cromwell
are also to be settled upon her.

53:41.286 --> 53:44.588
Her badges and emblems are
to be set up in all palaces,

53:44.689 --> 53:48.225
replacing all others,
and henceforth she is in all ways

53:48.359 --> 53:51.695
to be treated as the
Queen of England.

53:51.829 --> 53:56.166
[Moaning softly]

53:56.234 --> 53:59.603
Hush!

53:59.704 --> 54:01.405
What is it?

54:01.539 --> 54:04.107
Listen.

54:05.009 --> 54:08.712
Can you hear that?

54:08.780 --> 54:14.184
It's... It's raining!

54:14.252 --> 54:15.686
It's raining!

54:15.720 --> 54:17.587
[Laughing]

54:17.722 --> 54:20.891
Katherine. Katherine!
Where are you going?

54:20.925 --> 54:28.298
It's raining! Henry! Henry,
it's raining!
