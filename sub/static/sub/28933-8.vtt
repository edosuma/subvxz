09:25.390 --> 09:28.045
I-- Call me that
one more time.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.438
I swear...

09:29.481 --> 09:30.439
Whatever.

[groans]

09:32.049 --> 09:34.530

09:35.531 --> 09:37.577
I'm sorry.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.535
He just doesn't listen.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.102
We're not skating anymore today,
Steph.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.582
I-- What?We're done.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.540
Well, actually, wearen't done.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.497
Yeah, that's
a big, giant no.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.629
We'll have more questions,

09:46.673 --> 09:48.413
so stay close to home.

[indistinct chatter][phone buzzes]

10:00.861 --> 10:02.558
JULIAN:
If MI6

10:02.602 --> 10:05.039
thinks New York City's
first responder system is,

10:05.082 --> 10:06.649
indeed, at risk,

10:06.693 --> 10:08.259
why not go to the CIA?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.784
CIA may be compromised
on this.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.612
That's quite an accusation.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.743
Do you have evidence?

10:13.787 --> 10:16.398
That would put individuals
at risk.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.139
You're in danger.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.749
I'm perfectly fine.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.403
I can help you.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.883
We can help you.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.450
And we believe
that you can help us, too.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.236
But if you say yes,

10:28.279 --> 10:29.411
you can't speak
about this to anyone.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.152
Not even Dylan Reinhart.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.415
And why not?

10:33.458 --> 10:34.764
Given his
father's position

10:34.808 --> 10:36.070
at the CIA,

10:36.113 --> 10:38.072
Mr. Reinhart may be compromised.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.291
We can't take
any chances on this.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.778
Never easy, is it?

10:48.822 --> 10:50.824
No.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.477
But it is a reminder.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.392
Why we do this.

10:54.436 --> 10:57.352
Emily's parents will be on
the first flight from San Diego.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.136
The coach was at his
girlfriend's apartment

10:59.180 --> 11:01.399
in Tribeca this morning.
Alibi checks out.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.532
Got a split
on our competing skaters.

11:03.575 --> 11:06.143
Personal trainer confirms
that Reese was at the gym,

11:06.187 --> 11:08.580
but his skating partner,
Stephanie, lives alone,

11:08.624 --> 11:11.018
so there's no way to know if
she was home or when she left.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.584
Stephanie's tunnel vision
this morning

11:12.628 --> 11:14.761
at the rink
was quite remarkable.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.937
Or was that a total lack
of empathy?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.547
Isn't that on your

11:18.590 --> 11:20.592
"How You Know You're
a Psychopath" checklist?

11:20.636 --> 11:22.769
That's right. Along with
a grandiose sense of self

11:22.812 --> 11:24.596
and fake charm. But I don't
think she was a psychopath.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.598
What about the Zamboni driver?She doesn't po...

11:26.642 --> 11:28.252
You don't want to hear why?No.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.341
Uh, Daniel Gerhardt.
24 years old.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.778
At the ice rink for 18 months.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.388
Couple fast food jobs
before that.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.476
So he bounced around.
Any record?

11:34.519 --> 11:35.607
Squeaky clean.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.261
Emily's partner, Mario,

11:37.305 --> 11:39.655
found her body, but he
seemed genuinely distraught.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.309
Yeah, but why
would he want Emily dead?

11:42.179 --> 11:45.008
[music plays on video]

11:45.052 --> 11:47.445
Maybe because he has
another partner.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.492
This is on
Emily's computer.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.500
Wow.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.765
Neither mentioned that
they were a couple.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.462
Could be a secret.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.813
A secret that played a part
in Emily's death?

12:06.856 --> 12:09.554
Oh, pair figure skating is
still pretty behind the times.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.339
Not many same-sex partners.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.254
So if Emily didn't know about
this and then saw the video,

12:13.297 --> 12:14.472
it may have been upsetting
for her.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.518
Or it could be a threat
to her career.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.128
A potential PR problem.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.173
Maybe she confronted
them about it.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.522
And maybe Mario and Reese,

12:20.565 --> 12:22.524
having resentment and anger
at having to hide,

12:22.567 --> 12:24.395
didn't take it too well.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.441
Oh.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.274
A-At first
we didn't tell anyone.

12:33.317 --> 12:36.277
Not Emily or Steph
or our coaches.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.758
But it wasn't about
being gay. I mean,

12:38.801 --> 12:40.672
we were more concerned
about how it would look

12:40.716 --> 12:42.370
being on opposing teams.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.633
And when Emily found out,
what happened?

12:44.676 --> 12:47.767
She supported us 100%.Emily's the one

12:47.810 --> 12:48.898
who shot the video.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.508
That's why you found it
on her computer.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.554
You say you were
Emily's closest friend.

12:52.597 --> 12:55.296
Do you remember
anything different?

12:55.339 --> 12:56.776
Anything she said?

13:01.606 --> 13:03.826
Yeah, she said
she needed my help,

13:03.870 --> 13:06.786
that something had to stop.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.179
But when I asked her what, she
told me to forget about it.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.529
She didn't bring it up again.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.618
I know.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.403
I know I should've
pushed. I...

13:15.446 --> 13:17.231
I might have been able
to help her.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.675
Mario and Emily
were best friends.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.677
They spent
every waking moment together.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.418
What could be so difficult

13:30.461 --> 13:31.854
that she couldn't
even share with him?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.465
Emily lived with a secret,
and she died with it.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.643
Maybe we can find it
in her apartment.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.820
Hey.Sorry to interrupt.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.257
Can I, uh...
can I grab you for a second?

13:43.300 --> 13:46.129
Sure.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.610
Uh, I'll wait downstairs.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.959
Okay. I'll be
right there.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.531
[sighs]

13:56.574 --> 13:58.533
I overreacted earlier.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.709
I could have been more
sensitive when I expressed

14:00.752 --> 14:02.406
that Deputy Hill may have
overlooked something.

14:02.450 --> 14:03.886
I called him.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.627
You did? What changed your mind?

14:05.670 --> 14:07.803
Your batting average.No sports analogies, please.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.327
I told him I want to talk
about the reports

14:10.371 --> 14:11.938
that he filed for the Rego case.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.548
He slammed the door on it,

14:13.591 --> 14:16.377
said there's nothing more
to investigate in Garfield,

14:16.420 --> 14:17.682
which makes me think
that maybe

14:17.726 --> 14:19.510
there ismore to investigate.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.729
So what're you going to do?

14:20.772 --> 14:21.991
I'm gonna jump on a plane.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.645
Go see for myself.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.734
Good for you. It ain't over

14:25.777 --> 14:27.040
till the fat lady sings.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.650
Sports analogy.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.740
See? You do know sports!Well, opera, too.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.307
LIZZIE:
Doesn't look like Emily

14:33.350 --> 14:35.091
had much of a life
outside her sport.

"Ice rink. Ice rink.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.661
"Ice rink. Mario. Mario.
Mario. Calorie count.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
"Exercise reps.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.446
Sleep hours."

14:42.490 --> 14:44.622
A rigid daily schedule.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.016
Certainly not much time
for interior decorating.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.802
Or fine dining.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.936
Lemon chicken,
blackened chicken,

14:53.980 --> 14:56.678
yogurt-marinated chicken.

14:56.721 --> 14:59.028
I think she liked chicken.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.901
And keeping a diary.Ooh.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.299
Or not keeping a diary.

15:13.173 --> 15:14.870
Sawdust on the floor.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.567
She got new locks.

15:16.611 --> 15:20.658
And... a new bat.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.747
So either
she was changing sports...

15:22.791 --> 15:25.359
Or fearing for her life.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.409
Guess who I'm thinking of.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.063
No idea. How about a hint?

15:34.107 --> 15:35.369
Stephanie.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.500
Maybe she did take
Emily's medal,

15:36.544 --> 15:37.893
felt it was rightfully hers.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.155
And then killed
Emily to make sure

15:39.199 --> 15:40.417
her team won gold this year.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.724
Well, well, Dr. Psychopath

15:42.767 --> 15:44.465
is buying into my
psychopath theory.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.772
No. Remember
that Zamboni kid, Daniel?

15:47.816 --> 15:49.513
I've been thinking
about something he said, too.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.906
He called her "Stacy."

15:50.950 --> 15:53.213
So? He got her name wrong.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.477
Mm, "Stacy" is a derogatory term
for women used by incels.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.348
Incels?Involuntary celibates.

15:58.392 --> 16:01.177
Young men who feel
themselves undateable,

16:01.221 --> 16:04.441
victims of a society
that rewards alpha males,

16:04.485 --> 16:06.356
leaving them
dejected and alone.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.358
Poor guys.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.273
They feel they're owed sex.

16:10.317 --> 16:13.015
And incels tend to direct
their anger and frustration

16:13.059 --> 16:14.843
at the very women
who have ignored them.

16:14.886 --> 16:18.064
Stacys.
So if Daniel is an incel,

16:18.107 --> 16:20.544
then maybe he's the one
Emily was afraid of.

16:20.588 --> 16:24.374
And that's why she changed
her locks and bought that bat.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.420
Well, unless he has
an "incels rule" tattoo,

16:26.463 --> 16:28.422
any idea how we can prove
this theory?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.469
You want me to access
the online activity

16:32.513 --> 16:34.428
of a Zamboni driver?

16:34.471 --> 16:37.344
What in God's name is a Zamboni?

16:37.387 --> 16:38.910
A vehicle that resurfaces ice.

16:38.954 --> 16:41.609
If he is an incel,
we may have motive for murder.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.698
I'll get onto it right away.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.526
Lying and avoiding.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.442
Excuse me?

16:48.485 --> 16:50.357
Brief eye contact: lying.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.881
Performing a random physical
action that seems unnecessary,

16:52.924 --> 16:56.580
like excessively cleaning
your glasses: avoiding.

16:56.624 --> 17:00.193
Or my glasses are filthy.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.110
Yes, Dylan?

17:06.199 --> 17:08.375
You would only lie to me
about one thing.

[exhales]

17:12.422 --> 17:14.337
You've seen Maya.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.428
I met with her at her hotel.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.300
Nothing to worry about.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.824
Why don't I believe you?Because being skeptical

17:22.867 --> 17:25.392
is what makes us so good
at what we do.

17:25.435 --> 17:28.177
We had a coffee. Nothing more.

[footsteps approaching]

Sorry to interrupt
this totally normal, non-secret,

17:33.617 --> 17:35.402

breakroom chat,

17:35.445 --> 17:38.187
but Lou needs us
in her office. Now.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.853
[sighs]

17:51.896 --> 17:52.854
I have some news.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.290
Ryan's going back to Nebraska.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.162
I'm so glad I didn't know you

17:56.205 --> 17:57.467
when The Sixth Sensecame out.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.034
[chuckles]
I think I should go with him.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.253
You're on the skater case.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.602
We can fly there
after we solve it.

18:01.645 --> 18:02.820
Oh, does that work for you?

18:02.864 --> 18:04.953
Mm-hmm. He may be too close
to the case.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.259
He needs
an outsider's perspective.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.521
I'll send Fucci, then.

18:07.564 --> 18:08.783
A more intelligent
outsider's perspective.

18:08.826 --> 18:09.871
No offense.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.177
Oh, why would
I be offended?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.874
Dylan can go.
I'm fine with it.

18:12.917 --> 18:13.918
So am I.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.529
What a relief.

18:15.572 --> 18:18.401
Okay. Reinhart, you and Ryan

18:18.445 --> 18:19.576
will fly out first
thing tomorrow.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.361
Fucci will hold down

18:21.404 --> 18:22.666
the Sleeping Beauty fort here,
and Lizzie will take

18:22.710 --> 18:24.015
the figure skater case herself.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.539
But we just got a great lead.

18:25.582 --> 18:26.714
Which Lizzie will follow up on.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.019
You can all get out
of my office.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.196
Thank you, Lieutenant Gooden.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.636
Hey, is it me, or is that thing
actually making you angrier?

18:35.679 --> 18:38.160
You know, maybe there's
a better way to blow off steam,

18:38.204 --> 18:40.858
like going to the gym
or shooting someone.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.991
Get out. Quicker.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.688
Okay.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.516
You're annoyed at me
going away with Ryan.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.952
Not at all.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.476
You think I'm abandoning you.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.392
We're partners,
not boyfriend-girlfriend.

18:52.435 --> 18:55.177
I can share you
with Ryan or anyone.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.571
Okay. I just wanted to be sure.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.573
Rest assured,
I'm gonna be fine without you,

18:59.616 --> 19:01.575
and you'll be okay without me.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.664
You're right.

19:03.707 --> 19:07.189
I mean, life is a series
of separation experiences

19:07.233 --> 19:10.323
ending with the
ultimate separation, death.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.281
If you're gonna say
stuff like that

19:12.325 --> 19:14.457
around Ryan on your trip,
be sure to take

19:14.501 --> 19:15.893
the bullets out
of his gun first.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.726
Give me your honest opinion.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.946
Uh-oh.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.427
Too slick?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.168
You think I look

19:29.211 --> 19:30.952
too slick, don't you?
Like I'm trying too hard?

19:30.995 --> 19:32.432
I didn't say that.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.434
You didn't have to.
I bought another one,

19:34.477 --> 19:35.696
which makes me look
slightly less

19:35.739 --> 19:38.133
like a Ukrainian arms dealer.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.527
[laughs]: Andy. It's your first
job interview in a while.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.137
Just be yourself.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
Doesn't matter what you wear.Ah, coming from the guy

19:44.226 --> 19:46.185
who once wore a waistcoat
to the zoo.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.664
I'll take 'em both back.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.189
Oh, uh, I got you these.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.626
So you fit in.Fit in to what?

19:52.669 --> 19:54.671
You know what I mean.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.412
Uh, people from small towns

19:56.456 --> 19:58.588
don't wear suits made
from virginal goats

19:58.632 --> 20:00.242
or whatever that is. Trust me,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.070
as someone who grew up
in a small town.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.377
Oh, I trust you.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.553
And I also trust
that you kept the receipts

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
for these because if I
wear a flannel shirt,

20:07.989 --> 20:10.470
I will break out in a rash.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.733
[laughs] Okay.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.389
You know, it's strange.

20:16.432 --> 20:19.740
Lizzie seems so fine about
my going away with Ryan,

20:19.783 --> 20:22.786
I wonder if she's
actually upset about it.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.311
So fine she's upset.

20:25.354 --> 20:28.401
No, you're not
overthinking that at all.[laughs]

20:28.444 --> 20:30.403
Wait, do you want Lizzie
to be upset you're going?

20:30.446 --> 20:32.274
Do you want meto be upset?I...

20:32.318 --> 20:34.755
I just don't want
to let her down.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.583
Or you. And I know the timing

20:36.626 --> 20:38.802
isn't great, what with
your job interview tomorrow.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.195
Trust me, I'm not upset.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.763
Having you gone will allow me
to fully focus

20:42.806 --> 20:44.417
on my anxiety.[laughs]

20:44.460 --> 20:46.767
You're gonna be great.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.508
It's too bad
we're not the same size.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.206
You could've worn one
of my virginal goat suits.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.996
You looking for Dylan?

20:59.040 --> 21:00.650
I've got something for him, yes.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.958
Evidence that our friend Daniel
is an incel?

21:04.001 --> 21:05.916
As a matter of fact, it is.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.962
Let me see.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.880
I warn you, there are some
very unsavory things in there.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.665
Daniel made several posts

21:15.709 --> 21:17.798
to a restricted forum
known as "cel-life,"

21:17.841 --> 21:19.626
in which he refers
to the now-deceased

21:19.669 --> 21:20.975
figure skater as a "tease"

21:21.018 --> 21:22.672
and expresses an interest

21:22.716 --> 21:25.066
in "breaking
her pretty little neck."

21:25.109 --> 21:26.807
What a guy.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.504
I also uncovered a site

21:28.548 --> 21:30.463
on the dark web
where he's made similar threats

21:30.506 --> 21:31.768
and inflammatory remarks.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.596
You can say

21:33.640 --> 21:34.815
you stumbled upon it yourself,

21:34.858 --> 21:37.208
should you require
a proper search warrant.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.908
Thank you.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.518
You're welcome.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.177
I understand, Your Honor.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.354
Yes, I said that.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.138
Yes. [sighs]

21:54.182 --> 21:56.793
Yes. We are.

21:56.837 --> 21:57.838
Uh...

21:57.881 --> 21:59.143
Okay, bye-bye.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.928
The mayor?
[sighs]

22:00.971 --> 22:02.799
Again? Ugh.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.192
She must have quite
the phone bill.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.802
Mm.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.239
Oh, is this the Zamboni kid?Yeah.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.590
More than enough
for a warrant here.

22:10.633 --> 22:11.765
Go get it.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.074
Come with me.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.685
What?
You and me.

22:18.728 --> 22:21.078
Let's bust this woman-hater
together.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.906
I can't just walk out of here.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.691
Sergeant Harris is more than
capable of being in charge.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.780
Yeah, but the precinct
is my responsibility.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.782
Right, oh, the mayor might
call and yell at you again.

22:28.825 --> 22:30.392
And Fucci was right.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.699
You need to find a better
way to let off some steam.

22:32.742 --> 22:33.961
And it'll be fun,

22:34.004 --> 22:35.876
like our old days
back at the academy.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.878
Like me kicking your ass?

22:37.921 --> 22:39.662
I mean you kicking
everyone's ass.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.712
How I miss
the glamour of it all.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.888
[phone buzzes]If you're rusty, I'll
handle the hard stuff.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.933
Wouldn't want you
breaking a nail.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.109
Oh, I'm starting
to feel empathy for Reinhart.

22:52.153 --> 22:54.285
Stephanie alibied out.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.244
A witness saw her
leaving her house.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.811
So let's hope
this is our guy.

22:59.247 --> 23:02.119
Daniel Gerhardt?
Police, open up!

23:02.163 --> 23:04.121
We have a warrant. Let's
just kick this door down.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.037
Daniel, you in there?

23:09.823 --> 23:13.000
God, it feels good
to be back.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.963
Ugh, what's that smell?

23:20.007 --> 23:22.531
Maybe they'd have
more luck with women

23:22.575 --> 23:24.925
if they learned how
to clean up after themselves.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.853
Daniel! Police.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.071
How'd you get in here?

23:41.115 --> 23:42.377
We have a warrant
to search your apartment.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.074
Search for what?Evidence.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.207
In the murder investigation
of Emily Macabee.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.122
You think I killed her?

23:48.165 --> 23:49.819
I never even talked to her.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.821
But you did say you wanted
to break her neck.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.127
We have that in writing.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.911
DANIEL:
Yeah, I can say
what I want, Stacy.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.132
[whimpers]What'd you just call her?

23:58.175 --> 24:00.395
Hey, take a look at this.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.397
Would you like
to explain why you have

24:02.441 --> 24:06.053
a dead woman's stolen medal
in your apartment, Daniel?

24:11.754 --> 24:14.148
♪

24:20.241 --> 24:21.938
So, Garfield.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.549
You're looking at it.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.203
Used to be
a little more lively.

24:26.247 --> 24:29.250
Ah, damn, they got
Joe's Hardware, too.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.381
It's still charming.

24:30.425 --> 24:31.731
I feel like I've
stepped into

24:31.774 --> 24:33.776
a Norman Rockwell
ghost town.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.824
A tad overdressed.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.042
Nah, you'll fit in
just fine.

24:40.304 --> 24:42.219
Hey, Stock.Oh, here he is.

24:42.263 --> 24:45.353
Should've known you'd come
after I told you not to bother.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.963
Darren, good to see you.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.574
You, too.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.925
That New York smog
hasn't hurt you... much.

24:51.968 --> 24:54.144
[laughs] This is Dylan Reinhart.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.798
Dylan, this is Deputy Hill.

24:55.842 --> 24:56.843
Pleased to meet you.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.627
Ryan speaks very
highly of you.

24:58.671 --> 24:59.846
You're a cop?

24:59.889 --> 25:01.891
I'm a behavioral specialist.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.589
I consult for the NYPD.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.156
So, whose behavior
are you here to look at?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.723
RYAN:
Uh, like I said
on the phone,

25:07.767 --> 25:09.464
we just to make sure
nothing got overlooked.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.120
Uh-huh. So you hit a roadblock
in the big city,

25:13.163 --> 25:14.730
body count's going up,

25:14.774 --> 25:17.951
you're feeling the pressure,
so maybe you can blame it

25:17.994 --> 25:20.040
on the hick back home
who blew it from the start?

25:20.083 --> 25:21.694
Did he cut corners?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.957
Hey, his wife used to work
at Rego's, didn't she?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.655
That guy could be bitter.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.962
That the kind
of specializing you do?

25:29.005 --> 25:31.312
Sometimes.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.357
Sometimes I just
let people talk.

25:34.924 --> 25:36.926
So your wife worked
at the Rego factory?

25:36.970 --> 25:39.320
Whoa, am I a suspect now?

25:39.363 --> 25:40.756
Want to Mirandize me?

25:40.800 --> 25:43.542
Darren, look, we just want
to dig into the files,

25:43.585 --> 25:44.934
see if there's something useful.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.327
You want to be useful?

25:46.370 --> 25:47.937
Go see the Rego family.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.113
Give 'em a progress report
on your promise

25:50.157 --> 25:52.420
to catch their dad's killer.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.727
That's our next stop.Make it your last.

25:54.770 --> 25:58.034
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got work to do.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.779
[door opens]

26:03.823 --> 26:05.825
Good morning, Daniel.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.522
How'd you like your
night in lockup?

26:07.566 --> 26:10.481
There were five guys
in there glaring at me.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.092
I couldn't even lay down.

26:12.135 --> 26:13.659
When my dad gets here...

26:13.702 --> 26:15.965
Your dad?
Oh, your dad's on his way?

26:17.576 --> 26:20.013
Well, in that case,
you're free to go.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.537
Are you... serious?

26:22.581 --> 26:23.843
No, sit your ass back down.

26:23.886 --> 26:24.887
Daddy can't help you.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.411
Bitch.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.196
That's Lieutenant Bitch to you.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.851
I didn't do anything!

26:33.592 --> 26:34.549
Morning, sunshine.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.203
Remember me?

26:36.246 --> 26:37.900
Stacy?

26:37.944 --> 26:39.815
I brought you a coffee.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.556
Some milk and sugar,

26:41.600 --> 26:44.080
or whatever
this stuff is.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.821
Brought you
something else, too.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.649
What?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.825
I printed up some
of your online posts.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.087
You're quite the poet.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.742
"That Stacy spreads
on the ice,

26:53.786 --> 26:56.223
but not for me.
She'll get hers."

26:56.266 --> 26:57.659
Freedom of speech.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.966
All right,
Patrick Henry,

27:00.009 --> 27:01.750

27:01.794 --> 27:03.883

"That slut should take my..."

27:23.772 --> 27:27.036
"It's not fair,
it's rigged against us.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.430
"Should be my God-given right

27:29.473 --> 27:32.781
to take her by the..."

27:32.825 --> 27:36.045
A lot harder to say it
to a person's face, huh?

27:36.089 --> 27:39.788
Much easier to hide
behind a computer screen.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.137
Why'd you steal her medal?

27:41.181 --> 27:42.704
JASMINE:
Was it a warning?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.837
Before you tried to take
your God-given right?

27:44.880 --> 27:45.838
Before you forced
yourself on her?

27:45.881 --> 27:47.013
What? No.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.405
And when you failed
and screwed it up

27:48.449 --> 27:50.103
and strangled her

27:50.146 --> 27:53.062
in the process...No, I didn't touch her. I...

27:53.106 --> 27:54.977
I didn't.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.153
Okay, yeah-- okay, yeah,
I wrote this stuff online,

27:57.197 --> 28:00.417
but... I didn't kill her.

28:02.768 --> 28:07.076
I was on the computer
chatting...

28:07.120 --> 28:09.905
for two days straight.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.081
Please just...

28:12.125 --> 28:14.388
check my computer.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.912
I couldn't have
strangled anyone.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.617
I don't think
he's our guy.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.097
Are you kidding?
Look at him.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.970
That type always caves in
and wets themselves

28:31.013 --> 28:31.971
when they're about
to confess.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.189
We can dig
into his computer,

28:33.233 --> 28:34.582
but we need
to go at him hard.

28:34.625 --> 28:35.975
I think his online posts

28:36.018 --> 28:36.976
are a way of compensating

28:37.019 --> 28:38.717
for his feelings of inadequacy.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.153
He casts himself as a victim,

28:40.196 --> 28:41.937
unable to act, let alone attack.

28:41.981 --> 28:46.115
Well, look who's channeling
Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.988
Huh, yeah, maybe.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.773
Can't seem to get him
out of my head today.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.515
So while he's in there,

28:54.558 --> 28:58.084
let's get inside
Emily's head, too.

28:58.127 --> 29:01.957
Our victim was a strong,
driven athlete.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.307
As hateful and warped
as Daniel's philosophy is,

29:04.351 --> 29:06.962
I don't think that she would be
afraid of a guy like him.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.051
If he were harassing her,
she wouldn't hesitate

29:09.095 --> 29:11.619
to tell anyone, especially not
her best friend Mario.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.229
You're right.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.057
They could have easily
gotten him fired.

29:15.101 --> 29:18.060
And Emily didn't just
add locks to her door.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.714
She changed her locks.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.022
So she was afraid of someone
who at one time had a key.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.111
My guess would be
a... an ex-boyfriend

29:25.154 --> 29:28.070
but she didn't make time
for anything except skating.

29:28.114 --> 29:31.682
And whoever she was afraid of,
why keep it secret?

29:31.726 --> 29:33.902
Shame? Abuse maybe?

29:33.946 --> 29:36.731
Fear that coming forward
would tarnish her image.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.734
Just end up
as a he said, she said.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.432
And you know how those usually
end up; she needed proof.

29:42.476 --> 29:46.001
So we need to go back
to her place, take another look.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.136
RYAN:
We believe your husband
was the first

29:50.179 --> 29:51.833
in a series of killings.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.095
And why the blanket and pillow?

29:53.139 --> 29:54.967
The killer may have felt
some remorse

29:55.010 --> 29:56.316
after he murdered
your father,

29:56.359 --> 29:58.318
which may explain
why he was left

29:58.361 --> 30:00.146
in such
a peaceful position.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.061
When I heard about a similar
killing in Manhattan,

30:02.104 --> 30:04.280
where the victim
had also been left under

30:04.324 --> 30:06.674
a blanket and pillow,
I went there.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.197
That victim, Nancy Lee,

30:08.241 --> 30:11.244
she knew the killer,
she also knew

30:11.287 --> 30:12.245
about your husband's murder.

30:12.288 --> 30:13.724
We think
that she was murdered

30:13.768 --> 30:15.988
to keep her quiet.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.077
Now there is a third victim,
also in Manhattan,

30:18.120 --> 30:20.949
and he could have identified
the killer.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.258
I just want you to know
that, although my focus

30:25.301 --> 30:27.695
has shifted away from Garfield,

30:27.738 --> 30:29.349
I haven't forgotten
about my promise

30:29.392 --> 30:30.829
to find
your father's killer.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.352
DYLAN:
And Detective Stock
has the full support

30:32.395 --> 30:34.180
of the New York Police
Department behind him.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.834
And we're making great progress.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.096
We have a profile
of the killer.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.749
Do you even have a suspect yet?

30:40.229 --> 30:42.971
Um, no, not yet, Candace.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.799
So why are we here?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.583
So you can make yourself
feel better?

30:46.627 --> 30:47.889
Candace.No, I'm sorry, Mom,

30:47.933 --> 30:49.325
Dad's murderer is out there,

30:49.369 --> 30:51.240
and they are no closer
to finding who did it.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.155
These men are doing their best.Which is clearly not enough.

30:53.199 --> 30:56.028
Okay, guys. Yelling at each
other's not gonna help.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.812
No, it's all right.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.249
Your impatience
is justified.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.034
We understand how
such a violent loss

31:02.077 --> 31:03.862
can wear on a family.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.038
[scoffs] This started
long before Dad's murder.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.127
When this town decided to blame

31:08.170 --> 31:10.303
the entire country's
economic collapse on him.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.305
After he had given
everything to them.

31:12.348 --> 31:13.262
Okay, we don't have
to rehash all that.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.394
MRS. REGO:
Your father hated

31:14.437 --> 31:16.135
having to move
the factory to Mexico.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.093
[phone buzzes]His employees had been
like family.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.443
Then, overnight
they turned into enemies.

31:20.487 --> 31:24.317
CANDACE:
You really see
people's true colors.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.622
Are we keeping you?

31:25.666 --> 31:27.450
Not at all, but we are in town

31:27.494 --> 31:29.670
to coordinate
the investigations.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.759
Is Deputy Hill even doing
anything anymore?

31:31.802 --> 31:33.848
When I run into him,
he always looks the other way.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.156
He is. And we all
are going to find this guy

31:37.199 --> 31:39.854
and we're gonna
bring him to justice.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.421
CORMAC:
Sorry about all that.
I hope Ryan will vouch

31:41.464 --> 31:43.336
that my family
can be more hospitable.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.251
DYLAN:
Oh, I'd be upset, too.

31:45.294 --> 31:47.949
RYAN:
I remember this house was like
a second home to a lot of us.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.342
Please tell me your mom

31:49.385 --> 31:52.084
is still making
those chocolate chip brownies.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.868
I should remind her.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.870
[laughs]

31:55.914 --> 31:57.872
How is Mexico City?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.439
Fine, but it's not home.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.093
It's too crowded.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.703
You probably understand,
being in New York.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.966
I think Ryan has adapted
well to city life.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.186
Uh-oh. Don't tell me you're
gonna go all big city on us.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.839
[laughs]
Let's not get carried away.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.537
Thanks again, Ryan.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.278
Take care, Cormac.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.975
Thanks for everything
you're doing.

32:20.199 --> 32:25.334
So, after I cooled off, I had
to admit, you guys have a point.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.162
Behavior and all.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.991
I resent Ken Rego
as much as the next guy.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.037
The Regos lived high on the hog

32:32.080 --> 32:34.256
off this town's
labor for decades.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.215
When the going got rough,

32:36.258 --> 32:39.174
he threw us over
to save his fortune.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.394
Not very neighborly.But if I let
that interfere,

32:41.437 --> 32:43.309
I wasn't being a good cop.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.398
So I went
digging again.

32:45.441 --> 32:49.402
You want some lunch, Darren,
or are you just gonna eat crow?

32:49.445 --> 32:52.100
Mom, were you eavesdropping?

32:52.144 --> 32:53.493
Eavesdropping is
for amateurs, Ryan.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.190
Your mom runs a diner.
She's a professional.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.324
Finally, someone understands me.

32:58.367 --> 33:00.891
Don't you want some ketchup
with that?

33:00.935 --> 33:02.632
If you recommend it,
Margaret.

33:02.676 --> 33:04.199
Oh, I do, Dylan.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.462
Mm.I do.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.378
So I pulled the files
on a few locals

33:09.422 --> 33:12.033
who may deserve a closer look.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.296
I already dropped in
on Brad McFee's wife.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.429
Oh, I played football
with Brad.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.431
Brad had a temper.Priors for a couple

33:18.474 --> 33:20.346
of bar fights--
no biggie-- but get this.

33:20.389 --> 33:24.176
His new job, since the factory
closed-- he's a truck driver.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.353
He's on a haul to the
East Coast right now.

33:27.396 --> 33:28.571
That's a good find.Mm-hmm.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.356
Also, I probably

33:30.399 --> 33:33.359
went too easy on my old
neighbor, one of Rego's foremen.

33:33.402 --> 33:34.751
Lost his house.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.362
Oh, yeah, Steve Morgan.Huh.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.233
Has a cousin in Jersey.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.192
Is he still parked up
on a barstool?

33:40.235 --> 33:42.150
And still ranting
about Rego

33:42.194 --> 33:44.457
like that factory
closed yesterday.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.198
Ugh, he's not the only one.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.069
If I had a dollar for every time

33:48.113 --> 33:49.592
a customer gripes
about the glory days

33:49.636 --> 33:51.507
of Garfield,
I could retire.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.031
These people here are
too stuck in the past.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.033
Hey, I like my memories.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.122
Garfield was a good place
to grow up.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.994
Well, yeah, you'd better say so,
or I wasted 18 years,

34:00.038 --> 34:02.562
but my point is,
you didgrow up.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.129
Your mom's making
a fine distinction

34:04.172 --> 34:05.913
between two types
of nostalgia, Ryan.

34:05.956 --> 34:09.134
Reflective nostalgia allows us
to savor our memories

34:09.177 --> 34:11.614
but accepts
that they are in the past.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.268
Yeah, that's not Garfield.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.096
Whereas restorative nostalgia
pushes back

34:15.140 --> 34:17.446
against the here and now,
keeping us stuck

34:17.490 --> 34:19.274
trying to relive our glory days.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.755
And that isGarfield to a tee.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.278
Well, so no wonder
you guys are having

34:23.322 --> 34:24.627
such a tough time
finding Rego's murderer.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.325
This whole town's guilty.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.109
I wouldn't say
the wholetown's guilty, but

34:28.153 --> 34:31.286
much of Garfield suffers
from a single diagnosis.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.114
Restorative nostalgia.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.116
Restorative nostalgia.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.475
[sighs]

34:46.519 --> 34:48.651
Nope. No nanny cam here.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.479
Just so you know,

34:50.523 --> 34:53.178
my lieutenant does not
tolerate excessive force.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.965
Almost anything can be turned
into a secret camera these days.

35:00.402 --> 35:03.492
Unless, hmm,
we're on the wrong track?

35:03.536 --> 35:06.016
LIZZIE:
Wait.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.281
How many flashing lights
does your smoke detector have?

35:14.590 --> 35:17.593
Yup. Memory card.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.032
There. Go back.

35:24.818 --> 35:25.906
EMILY:
Go away.

35:25.949 --> 35:28.213
I don't want you
to come here anymore.

35:28.256 --> 35:29.692
MAN:
Come on, Em, open the door.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.172
EMILY:
No.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.174
MAN:
Open the damn door!

35:34.480 --> 35:36.438
Em, open the door.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.179
EMILY:
Go away!

35:38.223 --> 35:39.659
Who is that?

35:39.702 --> 35:41.226
Put down the bat
and open the door.I mean it-- go away.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.315
Her coach.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.192
Don't forget to smile, Caitlin.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.156
Attagirl.

35:59.722 --> 36:01.637
Detective.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.596
They give you
a new partner

36:03.639 --> 36:04.901
to work Emily's case?

36:04.945 --> 36:07.121
This is my boss
Lieutenant Gooden.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.558
Lieutenant.
Well, I'm glad to hear

36:09.602 --> 36:11.734
Emily's case is getting
the right attention.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.127
Oh, Emily has
our attention.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.216
Unfortunately,
too late to save her.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.609
JASMINE:
But it's understandable.

36:16.652 --> 36:17.914
She was terrified and unable

36:17.958 --> 36:19.394
to turn to those closest to her.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.831
Since one of them
was her perpetrator.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.050
We're gonna need you
to come downtown with us.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.008
Okay.

36:27.010 --> 36:31.014
Am I under suspicion?

36:31.058 --> 36:32.581
You were under suspicion

36:32.625 --> 36:34.366
beforewe stopped
by your girlfriend's apartment.

36:34.409 --> 36:36.324
What?JASMINE:
We explained to her

36:36.368 --> 36:39.066
how providing a false alibi
could expose her to charges

36:39.109 --> 36:41.068
of perjury and obstruction.LIZZIE:
She was

36:41.111 --> 36:42.809
pretty frightened, but, then,

36:42.852 --> 36:44.376
I guess you're probably used
to frightened women.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.986
You scared Emily
into submitting

36:46.029 --> 36:47.205
to your advances so she wouldn't

36:47.248 --> 36:48.467
jeopardize her skating career.

36:48.510 --> 36:49.859
Which worked when
she was younger,

36:49.903 --> 36:52.253
but she'd finally had enough.So, yesterday,

36:52.297 --> 36:54.255
when you found her on the ice
alone, did she threaten

36:54.299 --> 36:55.865
to tell Mario
if you didn't stop?

36:55.909 --> 36:57.171
Or had she already threatened

36:57.215 --> 36:58.825
to reveal
what you'd been doing to her?

36:58.868 --> 37:01.958
This is crazy.
I was like a father to Emily.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.265
I did everything
to help her succeed.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.006
So she owed you?

37:07.703 --> 37:08.922
CSU is testing every piece
of clothing

37:08.965 --> 37:10.793
inside Emily's apartment.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.013
DNA can last for months,
by the way.

37:15.058 --> 37:18.192
Okay, we had a relationship,

37:18.236 --> 37:20.194
but it was consensual.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.979
That's not what it looks like
on this recording.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.504
Brent Underhill,

37:25.547 --> 37:27.114
you're under arrest.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.115
Hey!

37:28.158 --> 37:29.899
Stop!

37:36.732 --> 37:39.518
[groaning]

37:40.867 --> 37:42.912
Excessive force?

37:42.956 --> 37:45.263
I think my boss
will understand.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.226
That was some fun.[chuckles]

37:52.270 --> 37:53.923
But next time
I hit the streets,

37:53.967 --> 37:56.012
I'm gonna have the right shoes
in my locker.

37:56.056 --> 37:56.970
[sighs]

37:57.013 --> 37:58.276
Nailing that scumbag

37:58.319 --> 38:01.017
is better than squeezing
that stress ball, huh?

38:01.061 --> 38:03.063
I couldn't take it
on a daily basis.

38:03.106 --> 38:04.934
I'd go Rambo.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.806
I'm safer behind a desk.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.938
The whole city is.
[laughs]

38:08.982 --> 38:11.201
You've grown, Lizzie.

38:11.245 --> 38:14.335
You're not only the biggest
badass in my precinct.

38:14.379 --> 38:16.598
You're the smartest badass.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.035
Well, you're the one who
forced me to get a partner.

38:19.079 --> 38:20.733
Dylan's rubbed off on me.

38:20.776 --> 38:23.257
So now, if you could
just rub off on him,

38:23.301 --> 38:24.911
my job would be a breeze.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.130
I wouldn't hold my breath.

38:27.174 --> 38:30.656
I know he's a genius,
but I don't know how you do it.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.530
Mm, he's an acquired taste.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.451
♪ She'd make me do

38:43.495 --> 38:47.325
♪ And all I did was
follow through ♪

38:47.368 --> 38:50.153
♪ I never saw a gal
so small... ♪

38:50.197 --> 38:52.242
So, you've made a decision?

38:52.286 --> 38:53.505
I have.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.202
I'm hoping it's good news.

38:55.245 --> 38:57.247
I can't imagine
that you'd come to tell me no.

38:57.291 --> 39:00.076
That's your move.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.644
Julian, that was years ago.

39:02.688 --> 39:06.169
I hope you won't let our past
get in the way of this.

39:06.213 --> 39:09.521
Our past is past.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.174
Whoever is trying

39:11.218 --> 39:13.046
to shut down New York's
first responder system--

39:13.089 --> 39:14.874
they have a bigger game at play.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.789
Which is?They're not telling me.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.966
But I do know
that the president of Turkey

39:20.009 --> 39:22.795
will be addressing the UN
General Assembly next week.

39:22.838 --> 39:26.015
You always knew
how to seduce me.

39:26.059 --> 39:29.932
♪ Amazing things
that she could do.♪

39:33.066 --> 39:35.024
Still working?

39:35.068 --> 39:37.070
Have to.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.681
If my whole town suffers
from restorative nostalgia,

39:39.725 --> 39:41.466
then I probably do, too.

39:41.509 --> 39:46.253
So I'm just going over my early
notes, see if I missed anything.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.777
What time does
your mom get back from work?

39:48.821 --> 39:50.213
You hungry again?

39:50.257 --> 39:51.650
[laughs]
No, I just...

39:51.693 --> 39:53.391
I want to hear more
about the old Garfield,

39:53.434 --> 39:55.436
the place everyone wishes
to go back to.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.046
Does she keep old photos?

39:57.090 --> 39:58.657
Does she.
Right over there.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.487
But it's not really
a history of Garfield.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.750
It's more of a history of me.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.889
Are these all you?

40:15.543 --> 40:17.850
[scoffs]
You were adorable.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.852
Well, I warned you-- doting mom.

40:19.895 --> 40:23.203
Oh, look at Main Street.
It's booming.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.205
This is the kind
of thing that I...

40:25.248 --> 40:27.468
[phone buzzing]

40:27.512 --> 40:29.470
Oh, it's Lizzie.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.167
Tell her I said hi.

40:37.696 --> 40:38.740
Hey, what's up?

40:38.784 --> 40:41.090
Just calling to say hi.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.310
Okay. Hi.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.486
Solved the case yet?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.488
We have some leads.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.188
[sighs]
How do you do it?

40:52.232 --> 40:53.929
Do what?

40:53.973 --> 40:55.409
You're thousands
of miles away,

40:55.453 --> 40:58.325
and I still couldn't get
your voice out of my head today.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.545
Oh, that must have
been just awful.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.112
Shockingly, it helped.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.897
Did you collar that incel?

41:04.940 --> 41:07.247
Turns out
it wasn't the incel. Uh,

41:07.290 --> 41:09.858
it was Emily's coach, an
entirely different abusive man

41:09.902 --> 41:12.208
with his own twisted way
of treating women.

41:12.252 --> 41:13.471
How'd you get him?

41:13.514 --> 41:15.168
I did what you do.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.039
I didn't just laser focus.

41:17.083 --> 41:20.173
I stepped back,
got an outsider's perspective.

41:20.216 --> 41:22.741
I do that?

41:22.784 --> 41:24.177
You do that.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.875
[sputters]
Maybe I should do it right now.

41:29.704 --> 41:31.489
Thanks, Lizzie, you're the best.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.186
Wait, wait, wait.I got to go.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.710
I'm the best for pointing out
that you're the best?

41:40.672 --> 41:43.326
Okay, hear me out.
Who in this town

41:43.370 --> 41:45.372
does not seem affected
by restorative nostalgia?

41:45.415 --> 41:47.287
Who did we meet
today who does not

41:47.330 --> 41:49.898
seem trapped in the past
but who, oddly, has moved on,

41:49.942 --> 41:52.640
like an outsider, undamaged
by the factory's closing

41:52.684 --> 41:54.294
or by Ken Rego's murder?

41:54.337 --> 41:56.209
His own son?

41:56.252 --> 41:57.602
Am I wrong?

41:57.645 --> 41:59.604
No.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.562
You're not.

42:01.606 --> 42:03.869
Check out the tent.

42:03.912 --> 42:06.306
Cowboy blanket.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.135
So, that's you and...?Cormac Rego.

42:18.927 --> 42:21.103
Is everything okay?

42:21.147 --> 42:22.757
Uh, we need to talk to Cormac.

42:22.801 --> 42:25.325
Well, he left hours ago. He flew
back to the plant in Mexico.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.372
Okay. Thanks.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.030
Yes. Yes, I see.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.684
I can't believe we had him
and let him slip away.

42:36.728 --> 42:38.817
Okay, thanks, Fucci.He take off yet?

42:38.860 --> 42:40.819
Yeah, but not
to Mexico City.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.560
Back to New York?

42:42.603 --> 42:44.344
He landed at JFK an hour ago.
