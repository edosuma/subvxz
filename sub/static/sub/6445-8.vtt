WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:34.531
What are you doing awake?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.067
Are you okay?

00:37.621 --> 00:40.112
I guess I just have a lot on my mind.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.075
Does it concern us?

00:49.633 --> 00:54.548
Lana, I know you've had your doubts.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.805
I know you sometimes wonder
if you can trust me.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.475
But I give you my word, you can.

01:03.313 --> 01:07.647
I'll always be here for you. Always.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.777
I know.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.364
I'm not sure you do.

01:21.290 --> 01:24.999
You have no idea
how much you mean to me.

01:36.138 --> 01:42.225
In an ideal world, l was hoping for
some sort of response, but it's okay.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.557
It's late. We're both tired.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.515
Lex.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.694
Mr. Luthor, there's been a breach.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.358
-What's the code?
-One-four-two.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.777
-What does that mean?
-Have to move.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.992
-Everything's gonna be ﬁne. We're safe.
-Move. Move.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.159
Miss Lang, hurry.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.952
-What's 142?
-Come on.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.621
I'll tell you everything
once we're in the panic room.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.008
Let's go, Mr. Luthor. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.170
Don't worry, Lana, you're gonna be okay.
I'm right behind you.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.472
Lex? Lex?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.016
Where did he go?

02:25.187 --> 02:26.723
Gotta get to the panic room.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.888
-Lex!
-Come on. Shut the door.

02:33.403 --> 02:39.694
Lana? Lana? Hello?

02:41.245 --> 02:45.329
ls anyone...here?

02:47.125 --> 02:49.161
What the hell is going on?

03:01.557 --> 03:03.468
This is insane.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.387
-You said it was urgent.
-It is.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.268
A Taiwanese cargo ship
was found off the coast of Alaska...

04:32.439 --> 04:35.021
...with its entire crew dead
of unknown causes.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.818
Details are murky, but the manifest says
its last stop was Bellona Island.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.023
Bellona Island?

04:41.198 --> 04:44.565
They got hit by a meteor the same day
I escaped from the Phantom Zone.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.366
Where's the ship now?

04:46.536 --> 04:49.118
-lt's being towed to Seattle.
-I have to go there.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.123
Clark. These guys aren't just meteor freaks.
They're from galaxies far, far away.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.626
And more importantly, they can hurt you.
You can't go unarmed.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.665
I won't. I have the crystal that
Raya gave me. I'll use that against them.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.423
Hey, Lana—

05:06.890 --> 05:08.721
Slow down. Are you all right?

05:10.060 --> 05:13.052
Oh, my God. Yeah, of course.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.219
What happened?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.648
Lex just mysteriously disappeared.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.725
I have to go to Seattle.

05:20.946 --> 05:24.154
Clark, I know that Lex isn't exactly
your pick for Man of the Year...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.315
...but you can'tjust
turn your back on him.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.906
Chloe, there's innocent people in danger.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

05:35.919 --> 05:39.878
Lex's car is garaged.
No movement on any ﬁnancial accounts.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.716
Airline manifests?

05:41.883 --> 05:43.464
All negative.

05:46.096 --> 05:50.465
Well, he can't just have dropped off
the face of the earth. We have to ﬁnd him.

05:52.436 --> 05:56.725
Lana. Please, come in.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.109
Would you excuse us for a minute?
Thank you, George.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.617
Lana, this is just devastating.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.449
I've taken a suite for you at the Metro
Seasons Hotel. It's for your safety.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.080
For my safety
or to distance me from the cover-up?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.119
A conspiracy?

06:20.297 --> 06:23.164
Security refuses to let me see
any of the surveillance footage.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.297
They tell me that I'm seeing things.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.501
Tell me.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.721
Tell me. What did you see?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.975
I don't even know
how to begin to explain it.

06:38.356 --> 06:43.896
But Lex turned into static
and then he disappeared.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.607
It was dark. Perhaps in the chaos—

06:49.785 --> 06:52.071
I know what I saw.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.157
What else do you remember?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.449
Anything.
Anything that can give me a clue.

06:58.627 --> 07:03.337
The guards mentioned a number.
A code, 142.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.338
You know what that means?

07:10.722 --> 07:14.806
No. No, but I will ﬁnd out.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.726
I'm sure you will.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.684
And I'd appreciate it if you let me know
when anything else comes up.

07:21.858 --> 07:26.522
Of course. I know how important
you are to Lex. Of course I will.

07:40.502 --> 07:46.247
Get me Dr. Chavez.
Genome technology. Yeah.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.137
-Were all the bodies accounted for?
-lt's kind of hard to tell.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.271
I'll keep you posted.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.663
You must be the ﬁrst-year med student
I've been waiting for.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.589
Don't ﬁatline on me now.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.928
What gave me away?

08:37.601 --> 08:40.843
The queasy stare that afﬂicts all newbies
their ﬁrst day on the job.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.431
Do you mind?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.392
-How many are there?
-A whole graveyard's worth.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.451
How does a body end up in one of those?

08:58.622 --> 09:02.740
They have no skeletons, although I don't
know how that's anatomically possible.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.414
You mean, someone cut their bones out?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.545
More like ripped them out.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.877
Clean ﬁlets, every one of them.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.471
I've seen some stuff that would make
most people run for the hills...

09:17.641 --> 09:20.132
...but this is seriously freaky.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.054
All these bodies, they're from the ship?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.018
These last two, they were dockworkers.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.982
Whatever was on that ship
is on dry land now.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.905
Kid, you puking already?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.250
Thank God someone believes me.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.416
You're the ﬁrst person who doesn't think
I belong in Belle Reve.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.334
Lana.

09:56.513 --> 10:00.005
A lot stranger things happened in Smallville.
Don't worry, we'll ﬁnd him.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.764
Lana, thank God you're all right.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.177
So where exactly was Lex
when he vaporized?

10:05.355 --> 10:08.392
He was somewhere in the middle
of the room, like, around here.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.148
Oh, no. You can't see me.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.982
You said Lex backs up all of his security
footage on an internal server, right?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.363
-Yeah, I think so.
-We're gonna need a password.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.775
You and Lex are close.
Are you password close?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.201
No, I guess not.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.409
Lana. The password is your birthday.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.746
Why don't you try Julian, his brother?
Or Lillian, his mom.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.160
Your birthday.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.337
Ixnay. Okay, how about Lana?

10:38.555 --> 10:41.547
-No. Anything else?
-I don't know.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.885
Damn it!

10:43.059 --> 10:44.139
Don't worry.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.553
We'll just upload the whole hard drive
and I'll work on it later.

10:48.773 --> 10:54.484
Chloe, the way he disappeared, what if....
What if Lex is really gone?

10:56.448 --> 10:57.984
Forever?

10:58.450 --> 11:00.736
Don't worry,
I'll ﬁnd my way back to you.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.993
You can't think that way, Lana.
We're gonna get him back.

11:04.372 --> 11:09.537
I've had so many doubts about
this relationship, so many suspicions.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.416
But now that he's gone,
none of it matters anymore.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.002
I just wanna see his face again.

11:16.760 --> 11:21.470
Lana, I love you so much.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.341
I'll crack this back at the Planet.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.182
Either we'll get footage of Lex sipping
bourbon and diddling on his computer...

11:30.357 --> 11:32.723
...or we'll actually hit the jackpot.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.270
Lana, wait. Don't go.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.356
How does it feel, Lex?

11:38.782 --> 11:41.524
Have your whole life ripped
from under you?

11:45.455 --> 11:46.865
I know you.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.405
Well, you should.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.667
You saw my face
through the observation window.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.293
You're the 142.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.814
I know that "Lex Luthor Lost"
is a juicy headline.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.267
But why are we searching for
the root of all evil?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.727
I'm not doing this for Lex.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.814
After talking to Lana,
I've got to put my skepticism in check.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.900
I mean, she really cares about him.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.236
Women are such a mystery.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.744
Finding Lexis a bigger mystery.
Where's Clark when you need him?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.825
What does Clark have to do
with anything?

12:29.999 --> 12:33.662
Look, I know that you feel sorry for the guy
because he's always ﬂying solo.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.623
What can that guy do that I can't?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.583
You know, you're probably right.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.999
He wouldn't brave the rush-hour crunch
to get your favorite cuisine.

12:41.177 --> 12:45.170
All so that you can have time to continue
the hunt for a man that nobody misses.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.679
-Well, maybe except--
-Lana.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.430
The hunt for Lex is on.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.849
Get you anything from
the basement buffet?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.433
Thank you, but I'm okay.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.941
So I do have some good news.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.194
I managed to stumble
on the magic password...

13:01.364 --> 13:05.528
...and it turns out to be none other than
the birthday of Miss Lana Lang.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.911
I was able to access the surveillance ﬁles
and look what I dug up.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.046
There's something there.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.715
Can you make it any clearer?

13:22.886 --> 13:26.674
I'm doing my best, but I don't have a lot
to work with. It's gonna take some time.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.558
-Hello?
-I know what happened to Lex Luthor.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.017
Who is this?

13:37.734 --> 13:41.226
If anyone knows we're talking,
we're both in danger.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.360
What's wrong?

13:45.033 --> 13:48.946
It's just Lex's security.
They wanna give me an update.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.757
-Did anyone follow you here?
-No.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.547
Please, what happened to Lex?

14:10.725 --> 14:13.262
I took him.
And if you wanna see him again...

14:13.436 --> 14:17.224
...you'll keep your mouth shut
and listen to exactly what I have to say.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.973
Whatever you want, just don't hurt him.

14:20.818 --> 14:25.187
You know your boyfriend has a secret lab
inside LuthorCorp Tower called 33.1?

14:25.365 --> 14:27.230
Why is it secret?

14:27.492 --> 14:31.485
Because they run experiments on the people
who've been infected by the meteor rocks.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.951
When patients are released from Belle Reve,
instead of freedom...

14:35.124 --> 14:38.082
...they get a one-way ticket to
a secret laboratory.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.868
How do you know all this?

14:40.338 --> 14:44.877
Because I was one of them,
until I broke out last night.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.045
Why should I believe you?

14:48.263 --> 14:52.802
See, that's the point. Nobody believes me.
I'm a former mental patient.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.810
But you. You're Lex's beloved girlfriend.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.393
Once you blow the whistle on this place,
people will have to listen.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.892
Where's the evidence?
You don't have any proof.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.649
Of course I do.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.574
I can take you there.
You can see for yourself.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.740
And then you'll release Lex?

15:26.426 --> 15:31.386
Let's keep the area clear, please.
Back up. Thank you.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.849
Hey, this area is off limits.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.680
I'm with the coroner's ofﬁce.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.974
Better you than me.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.060
I heard the bodies are pretty messed up.

15:44.235 --> 15:47.318
Anyway, our theory is
the perp was hiding out in this container...

15:47.488 --> 15:52.608
...and somehow busted out of this thing
and started his killing spree. It's wild.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.737
We thought it was blood,
but the guys say it's human bone marrow.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.333
It's fricking disgusting.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.578
There are a few more remains
that need removal.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.042
The forensics team is over there
waiting for you.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.468
-Thanks.
-Sure.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.242
-Who are you?
-Someone who's hungry.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.749
Oh, no!

17:01.604 --> 17:05.563
You said you were infected by the meteors.
What happened to you?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.438
I was an electrician.

17:10.279 --> 17:14.113
I was working up in a radio tower last year
when the meteors hit.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.154
I got thrown off and somehow, l--

17:17.328 --> 17:19.614
You ended up with an ability.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.126
What is it?

17:26.421 --> 17:29.083
I can move through alternate frequencies.

17:30.758 --> 17:36.298
I can shift into planes of existence
that nobody knows exist.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.517
You think I'm strange, wait till you see
some of the other people on this ﬂoor.

17:42.687 --> 17:46.145
Aren't you afraid they're just gonna grab
you the minute those doors open?

17:48.359 --> 17:54.480
If I have to sacriﬁce myself
to get the truth out, then so be it.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.033
The fact is they're not gonna grab you.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.513
I don't understand. This is wrong.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.856
It was here.

18:31.027 --> 18:34.269
Twenty-four hours ago, it was all here.
The holding cells, the labs.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.028
Take me to Lex.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.156
What did that bastard do with everyone?

18:39.327 --> 18:42.034
I know that you believe
that something was here.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.122
But clearly,
nothing's been here for a long time.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.829
-l'm telling you, it was here!
-Okay.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.961
Just relax. We'll ﬁgure out
where everything was moved to.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.214
But ﬁrst, I need you to tell me
what you've done with Lex.

18:58.221 --> 19:01.429
I put him in a place
where he can't hurt anyone else.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.178
lib}

19:16.489 --> 19:19.071
What did you do with 33.1?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.524
I didn't do anything.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.407
-lt's obvious I haven't gone anywhere.
-Don't lie to me.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.666
It's the truth.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.540
The truth?

19:30.253 --> 19:34.496
The truth is you kept me locked up
in a concrete bunker...

19:34.674 --> 19:37.086
...just when I was about to go back
to a normal life.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.966
Normal life?

19:39.971 --> 19:42.257
You were never gonna be released
from Belle Reve.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.683
It was a ﬁgment of your fractured mind.
I was trying to help you.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.139
-Where are the other patients?
-If I knew, don't you think I'd tell you?

19:55.736 --> 19:58.068
I didn't wanna have to resort
to violence, Lex.

19:58.239 --> 20:01.606
-You're not giving me much of a choice.
-Okay. Calm down.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.194
Maybe when I bring Lana here...

20:09.083 --> 20:11.540
...we'll see if you talk.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.466
Wow, I knew you were a gadget junkie...

20:24.640 --> 20:27.347
...but this stuff looks like
it's from the Jurassic era.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.306
When I heard about Mr. Frequency Jumper,
I decided to dust off my pop's ham radio.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.469
Ham radio?

20:36.402 --> 20:39.144
I used to sneak downstairs
onto the late-night airwaves.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.610
My handle? Jimmy the Infuriator.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.990
Why does that not surprise me?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.330
All right. Just listen carefully, girls.

20:48.831 --> 20:51.789
"password. I know you guys are close.
Are you password close?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.415
No, I guess not.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.340
-Right there. Did you hear that?
-How could you not?

20:58.507 --> 20:59.587
It's a radio frequency.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.501
After scanning all the footage,
that sound kept coming back.

21:02.678 --> 21:07.047
I tried blending the narrowband frequency
modulation with a uhf modulation.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.938
Okay, just-- Here, check this out.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.981
-I'II ﬁnd my way back.
-You can 't think that way.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.862
-lt's him.
-We 're gonna get him back.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.739
Lex was there. You couldn't hear him.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.116
-Or see.
-Oh, my God.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.823
I just wanna see his face again.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.040
Lana, I love you so much.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.208
He heard everything I said.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.710
Look, this may sound absurd...

21:45.888 --> 21:48.971
...but I think that Lex may be trapped
in another frequency.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.719
Okay, kind of like radio. The way AM
and FM are different frequencies...

21:54.897 --> 21:56.728
...but they move through
the same space.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.685
Can we communicate with him?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.399
There's a frequency loop in the library.

22:01.570 --> 22:05.483
So as long as you're in that room,
it might be possible.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.427
Help! Help!

22:36.772 --> 22:37.761
Somebody, help!

22:40.526 --> 22:42.266
Run. Go.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.110
You stole my food.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.158
Nice try, Krypton Man.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.456
-You escaped from the Phantom Zone.
-But I'm no Phantom.

23:35.790 --> 23:40.625
I think it must be
some kind of a glitch or....

23:41.087 --> 23:44.955
I don't know much about this stuff,
but I do know that-- Excuse me.

23:45.132 --> 23:51.503
--that when you hack into
a secure operating system...

23:52.515 --> 23:54.597
...you could pick up
some very nasty viruses.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.349
Well, I guess
I'd better take that to heart.

23:58.354 --> 24:03.314
Miss Sullivan, LuthorCorp considers any
breach of security a very serious matter.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.521
-And you know that.
-Mr. Luthor, I'm trying to ﬁnd your son.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.688
I appreciate that. In fact, I was hoping,
being the diligent reporter you are...

24:10.866 --> 24:13.653
...that you'd provide a clue
that would help me to ﬁnd Lex.

24:13.828 --> 24:16.865
Well, the only clue I have
is a little lab called 33.1.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.157
Otherwise known
as meteor freak central.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.293
-l was always under the impression that—
-Meteor freaks?

24:25.131 --> 24:29.625
You're not in high school anymore, Miss
Sullivan. This is the real world. Please.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.147
What's devious Daddy Warbucks
doing here?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.726
Lionel Luthorjust ransacked
all of my research.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.811
So now we're back to square one.

24:50.072 --> 24:53.360
Well, maybe not square one.
More like triangle one.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.067
Jimmy, what's up?

24:57.413 --> 25:01.827
Triangulation. I might actually have a way
of squeaking Lex out of that frequency.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.716
Lex, I know you're here.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.924
Hopefully you can hear me...

25:21.270 --> 25:24.979
...because there's something that I...

25:25.149 --> 25:27.185
...that I wanna confess.

25:29.403 --> 25:32.566
I have been so focused
on our problems...

25:32.740 --> 25:36.358
...that I have lost sight of how much
you really mean to me.

25:38.495 --> 25:43.489
All those times
I was reluctant to trust you. The fact is...

25:45.920 --> 25:49.504
...you're more honest with me
than anyone's ever been.

25:54.136 --> 25:57.628
I miss you— I miss you so much.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.554
I don't know what I'd do without you.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.652
I love you, Lex.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.688
I love you too, Lana.

26:18.744 --> 26:23.329
Please. Please, don't leave us here.

26:23.499 --> 26:26.457
I don't wanna have this baby
without you.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.589
I know I should have told you.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.304
Stay away from her!

26:43.519 --> 26:45.475
Lex, you are here.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.896
I'm sorry to have to put you through this.

26:53.112 --> 26:59.529
Either you tell me where you moved 33.1
or you can say goodbye to Lana Lang.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.956
Whatever Lex has done in the past,
I'll make him stop. He'll listen to me.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.918
You hear that, Lex?
Even your love wants you to come clean...

27:15.092 --> 27:17.549
-...and tell the world what you've done.
-Let her go.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.552
You can see him?

27:21.432 --> 27:22.888
Where is 33.1?

27:23.058 --> 27:25.049
I told you, I don't know!

27:25.227 --> 27:27.889
-Now let go of her.
-Lex!

27:29.606 --> 27:33.269
Well, then, let's get started.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.736
I didn't know you had it in you.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.402
Why do you think they call me
Jimmy the lnfuriator?

27:45.914 --> 27:47.199
Lexis a dead man.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.240
Don't let him get away.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.283
He's not going anywhere.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.208
Where is Lex? What's the frequency?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.592
Lana, what are you doing?

28:03.057 --> 28:04.672
Okay, that can't be a good thing.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.808
We need that
radio frequency jammer now.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.104
I think I'm picking up on something.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.269
Lana.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.107
She wanted to say goodbye in person.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.613
-Hurry.
-Whatever frequency they're in...

28:29.792 --> 28:32.499
-...l have to jam that signal.
-What's the problem? Do it.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.581
Okay, sure, no problem.
Only a gazillion to sort through.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.478
-l'm getting too much interference.
-Jimmy, hurry.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.501
Chloe, do you hear that?

29:25.389 --> 29:28.722
Lana. Wake up.

29:31.854 --> 29:35.597
Lex. You're okay.

29:37.359 --> 29:40.021
-Why are you here?
-I had to ﬁnd you.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.690
You shouldn't have done that.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.823
-I’d rather be trapped than never see you.
-I think I'm getting something.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.359
Come on. Come on.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.034
Is it true?

29:54.835 --> 29:56.450
You did hear?

29:58.005 --> 29:59.620
Everything.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.508
I'm trying to bypass the oscillator
and go direct.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.469
I'm gonna try increasing the agitator.

31:07.783 --> 31:11.025
Your blood must make you strong.
I should taste it.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.617
-Why are you doing this?
-Everyone's gotta eat.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.112
Hey.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.663
That was you, wasn't it?

32:25.694 --> 32:28.731
Whatever was on this ﬂoor
wasn't your typical cubical farm.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.692
There's enough power pumping in here
to light up Metropolis.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.280
Something tells me it wasn't just
for the ﬂuorescent lights.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.700
Well, it's just a matter of time
till I get to the bottom of it.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.575
You really manned up
and got right into this ﬁght.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.377
Still wish Clark was here to help?

32:47.174 --> 32:50.666
Come on. Clark Kent can't hold
a candle to the Infuriator.

32:51.887 --> 32:56.130
Hey. Find anything interesting?

32:57.392 --> 33:01.135
Yeah, I gotta say,
this all just feels a little strange.

33:01.313 --> 33:06.023
Have you ever considered the possibility
that maybe Bronson was telling the truth?

33:07.277 --> 33:09.689
And this was some secret laboratory?

33:10.447 --> 33:14.315
Chloe, I don't think Lex would've given us
clearance if he had something to hide.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.784
It seems a lot of hoops for someone
bent on revenge to jump through...

33:17.954 --> 33:21.196
-...if 33.1 never even existed.
-Well, Chloe, that guy was delusional.

33:22.167 --> 33:25.751
The meteor exposure made him sick.
He spent over a year in Belle Reve.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.788
There's a lot more to this story
than meets the eye.

33:28.965 --> 33:33.755
-You don't know the Luthors like I do.
-You don't know Lex like I do.

33:36.848 --> 33:41.433
I'm not gonna take the word of
a homicidal maniac over Lex. I'm sorry.

33:41.603 --> 33:45.061
Lana, you can't prove that
33.1 didn't exist.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.814
And you can't prove that it did.

34:09.214 --> 34:14.675
It says on the door out there that
this is my ofﬁce. My private ofﬁce.

34:14.845 --> 34:16.801
Obviously,
that doesn't mean much to you.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.964
You interfered with
a project you have nothing to do with.

34:21.017 --> 34:24.805
Oh, you must be talking about--
What do you call it? --33.1?

34:24.980 --> 34:27.096
You should thank me
for coming to the rescue.

34:27.274 --> 34:31.392
I'd hate to think of the legal repercussions
if that clinic was discovered.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.279
Not to speak of the dirt that would
stick to our corporate image.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.780
You did this for selﬁsh reasons.

34:40.954 --> 34:44.572
Your fascination with the meteor-infected
started long before mine.

34:45.625 --> 34:52.121
But you've gone farther with this scientiﬁc
experiment than I ever believed possible.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.834
Congratulations.
Kudos, son. I'm proud of you.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.591
Your methods are a tad disappointing.

35:00.766 --> 35:05.180
You've still got a lot to learn
when it comes to the ﬁne art of secrecy.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.141
What did you do with 33.1?

35:13.570 --> 35:18.405
Moved it. The whole shebang.
To a top-security location.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.158
I'm happy to let you have
the coordinates.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.157
Just one condition.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.208
-And what might that be?
-Make me your full partner.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.999
I wanna know everything
about this project.

35:35.717 --> 35:39.505
It'll give us a chance to spend
more quality time together.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.807
So, what, your cell phone
doesn't get reception in Seattle?

35:54.361 --> 35:56.192
I was preoccupied.

35:56.363 --> 36:00.652
That's ﬁne. But you were up against
an alien from another planet. I was worried.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.191
I'm
sorry

36:04.204 --> 36:06.411
So the crystal was a success?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.872
No, it wasn't.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.584
Then did the Zonerjust decide to pack up
and leave the solar system?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.087
Someone else killed him.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.925
Someone who can do things
I could only dream of.

36:25.767 --> 36:29.601
So this someone, he's on our side, right?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.558
I'm not sure.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.771
Clark, it's me, your most
trusted friend and secret-keeper.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.856
How about a few details?

36:39.030 --> 36:42.113
Believe it or not, there are some things
you don't need to know.

36:43.451 --> 36:47.694
I understand that you feel like all these
psychopathic space invaders are your fault.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.239
But you can't keep it all inside.

36:50.959 --> 36:54.793
You feel the need to carry the world
on your shoulders and that's noble.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.205
But there are other people
who wanna help you ﬁght the good ﬁght...

36:58.383 --> 37:00.544
...and you need to let them in.

37:04.097 --> 37:07.464
Because sometimes,
even heroes need to be saved.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.177
Lana, you should be off your feet.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.684
Here, sit down.
Can I get you something to drink?

37:52.854 --> 37:55.721
Lex, I'm pregnant, I'm not an invalid.

37:56.191 --> 37:59.479
I'm sorry. I just wanna
make things perfect for you.

38:00.111 --> 38:05.606
No, I'm sorry.
I had no right to keep this a secret.

38:06.242 --> 38:10.861
I wanted to tell you, I just....
I wasn't sure.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.370
Of how I'd react?

38:14.417 --> 38:20.162
Lana, it's the best news I've ever heard.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.834
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:27.055 --> 38:30.263
The woman I love is carrying my child.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.219
Our child.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.219
What more could a man want?

38:44.614 --> 38:49.734
Listen, Lex, about this 33.1 place....

38:52.580 --> 38:55.993
I already told you. It never existed.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.659
But if it did.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.417
I'd understand why.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.502
These people who've been infected
by the meteors, they're dangerous.

39:09.264 --> 39:12.677
They've hurt me
and they've hurt people that I care about.

39:14.477 --> 39:18.095
The more we learn about them,
the better we can protect ourselves.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.901
Then there's something else
you need to know.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.834
Lana Lang...

40:28.593 --> 40:31.881
...I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.141
Will you marry me?

41:23.481 --> 41:25.472
