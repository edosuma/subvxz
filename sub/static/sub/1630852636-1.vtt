15:57.957 --> 15:59.625
We can't rely on that no more.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.586
I can set up numbered accounts,
take us offshore.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.756
And you bought this place in your name?

16:07.257 --> 16:12.888
Well, it-- it shields the farm to have it
in a separate name, launder-wise,

16:12.972 --> 16:16.517
but it does bring up a question
about our partnership.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.981
We should probably talk percentages.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.608
[Wyatt] Oh no,
we don't need to talk about money.

16:24.692 --> 16:29.071
No. Ruth is right.
It's best to be direct and clear.

16:30.572 --> 16:34.994
Um, well, what seems fair to me,
seeing as it's your farm,

will split the other half, 25 each.

I thought you should have these.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.018
Why don't you think
I should work for your parents?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.733
Because my mom was the one
who had Ben killed.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.155
So, you know?

20:08.957 --> 20:09.958

for Ben to be killed.

Hi.

I'll keep this super short, I'm looking
for Helen Pierce, your business partner.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.120
Seems she kind of
dropped off the face of the Earth.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.206
It's my job to find her
so that she can sign some documents.

that we just need to

27:29.272 --> 27:31.149
push through to the other side,

27:31.232 --> 27:33.526
and then we'll be free of the cartel

ever not loses anything.

and then we need to buy all the people.

Omar Navarro into a model citizen.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.034
Yeah.

28:24.619 --> 28:29.124
And then we need to convince Darlene Snell
to shut down her heroin operation.

Members of the Lagunas Cartel
returned fire.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.443
Four members of the cartel were killed,

28:56.526 --> 28:58.862
including the organization's
third in command.

28:59.904 --> 29:04.826
We were able to confiscate heroin
with a street value of $350 million,

29:04.909 --> 29:07.912
as well as cash
and a small arsenal of weapons.

29:08.663 --> 29:12.876
I'd like to applaud Agent Miller
for the intel that led to the raid.

we gleaned on the Lagunas operation.

Please review it before our next briefing.

to be in the field means to you.

That's why you were in Marty's office
trying to steal his software.

Couldn't make it on your own. Is that it?

31:04.487 --> 31:07.323
So what's this message
from Mexico that's so important

31:07.407 --> 31:09.117

31:09.200 --> 31:13.955
Uh, the Navarro Cartel has been
made aware by you, Darlene,

31:14.038 --> 31:17.792
that you intend
to start producing heroin again,

31:17.876 --> 31:22.505
and they have instructed us
to warn you not to.

ever even came to the Ozarks, so…

31:32.891 --> 31:36.185
Okay, but we did come.
It's a different world now, that's a fact.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.688
[Darlene] So is the fact that
I don't give a good goddamn

31:38.771 --> 31:42.150
what you or your Mexicans
have to say about anything.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.985
Okay, but if you don't do this,

31:44.068 --> 31:47.572
their response is gonna be quick
and it's gonna be brutal.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.201
We're just the messengers here.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.411
[scoffs]

31:53.494 --> 31:54.370
Right.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.540
Because you don't take
fucking action. Do you?

31:58.583 --> 32:01.210
-That's for other people.
-This isn't a personal squabble.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.962
-This is real.
-[scoffing] Oh!

32:03.046 --> 32:05.298
Oh, I know it's fucking real.

32:05.381 --> 32:06.799
[Wendy] No, you don't.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.177
Helen worked for that cartel
for ten years,

32:09.260 --> 32:11.471
they blew her brains out two feet from us.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.182
We had to wash
pieces of her out of our hair.

32:15.808 --> 32:16.768
That's real.

32:18.561 --> 32:22.273
[Marty] So we had a moral obligation
to give you this news.

32:22.815 --> 32:26.277
Your life is in danger,
so is Wyatt's, so is Zeke's.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.032
I'll worry about my family. Thank you.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.701
Now unless there's
anything else you have to say?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.203
That's it.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.875
Ruth. Ruth.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.966
Please make her listen.

32:49.425 --> 32:50.885
Don't get yourself killed.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.474
Like you fucking care.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.852
[Marty] Of course I care.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.689
[Wendy] Don't bother. She's made her bed.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.322
Ruth.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.536
Hey, look, don't let them get to you,
okay? You don't work for them anymore.

33:16.619 --> 33:20.415
I kind of thought of Helen
like some giant fucking machine,

33:20.498 --> 33:22.041
like a thresher or some shit.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.210
I didn't think
she could be fucking killed.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.130
Don't worry, Darlene's got this. Okay?

33:30.216 --> 33:31.300
Look, I should go.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.510
No, Wendy's right.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.220
No, I-- I'm fucked.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.264
I-- I need Marty's software.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.933
I know how to run the system.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.602
I just don't know
how to build the fucking system.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.397
-You'll figure it out. I'm sure.
-I'm-- I'm serious.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.107
So am I! I have faith.

33:47.775 --> 33:48.609
Why?

33:50.361 --> 33:53.239
Because you're Ruth fucking Langmore!
That's why!

34:00.913 --> 34:02.915
[truck engine turns over]

[Mel] But she hasn't returned
phone calls in two days.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.713
[Nix] Yeah, well, I'm afraid
this is the first I'm hearing about it.

34:09.464 --> 34:13.217
So, you check back here in 48 hours

34:13.301 --> 34:15.678
and I can consider her a missing person.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.848
I know. But in the meantime,
it's just, maybe you could, uh…

34:19.724 --> 34:22.894
you know, run by her place,
check inside, find out what she's up to,

34:22.977 --> 34:25.188
see if there's any signs
of foul play, you know?

34:25.980 --> 34:26.898
Sheriff stuff.

34:26.981 --> 34:30.401
To be honest, I don't know what business
Helen Pierce had here in the Ozarks

34:30.485 --> 34:31.652
and I don't want to know.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.988
What does that mean?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.656
[sighs] Nothing.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.659
Dude, I just need a signature. Please.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.873
I got a cat that misses me in Chicago,
her name's Loretta Lynne.

34:43.956 --> 34:47.251
She's gonna chew her own paw off
if I don't get back to her in time,

34:47.335 --> 34:50.671
so just give me a little help
and I'll be out of your life forever.

34:52.381 --> 34:56.511
Well, I'm sorry, but it sounds like
you've got a divorce case

34:56.594 --> 34:58.971
and a wife who doesn't want
her husband to find her,

34:59.055 --> 35:00.681
and that's not my business.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.725
Right.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.561
Well…

35:10.983 --> 35:12.985
Just in case you change your mind.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.948
[elevator dings]

35:34.048 --> 35:37.343
[Maya] I'm not supposed to speak to you
with your hearing pending.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.720
Right. Because you're by the book.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.306
It's not my fault
you're getting disciplined.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.307
You reported me!

35:43.391 --> 35:47.019
Because you accepted
a confession you knew was false.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.397
-And you knew could get someone killed.
-See, you--

35:51.566 --> 35:54.152
I've busted my ass for 15 years.

35:55.278 --> 35:59.907
I'm trying to take drugs off the street.
I'm trying to save people's lives.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.993
Same as you. Fifteen years.

36:02.076 --> 36:03.703
-What do you want?
-I want--

36:05.997 --> 36:09.125
I want you to understand all that
before you get in front of the board

36:09.208 --> 36:11.335
and make it sound like
it's something it's not.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.134
You want to know the truth?

36:19.343 --> 36:20.386
Straight up?

36:21.888 --> 36:22.805
Straight up.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.684
I don't give a shit about your motivation.

36:27.476 --> 36:30.771
The only thing that matters is
what you did, and what you did was wrong.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.943
-Now, you need to leave me be.
-See…

36:37.236 --> 36:38.821
You don't get to have it both ways.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.617
You don't get to act like
you're on the high road

36:42.700 --> 36:45.661
when you really down here
on the ground with the rest of us.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.040
-You know what I think? I--
-What?

36:49.123 --> 36:50.791
That I'm a hypocrite?

36:50.875 --> 36:54.253
That I'm a purist who makes compromises?

36:54.837 --> 36:57.632
You gonna tell me how other agents
think I got a commendation

36:57.715 --> 36:59.759
for being the pawn
of a drug cartel operative,

36:59.842 --> 37:02.178
so how dare I look at the world
as black and white?

37:02.261 --> 37:04.138
Is that the truth you about to drop?

37:09.518 --> 37:10.895
Get yourself home.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.190
You don't want them to see you here
while you're suspended.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.152
[menacing music playing]

39:22.109 --> 39:24.028
Thank you for cleaning up the living room.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.239
Didn't think I had a choice.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.368
[Wendy] You didn't…
but I appreciate it anyway.

39:32.995 --> 39:36.082
Speaking of which, thank you
for dealing with Ruth at the casino.

39:36.165 --> 39:37.541
[Charlotte] Yeah, of course.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.169
What did Ruth do?

39:41.796 --> 39:44.632
Ruth tried to steal
the proprietary financial software

39:44.715 --> 39:47.259
that I wrote for the, um, shell companies.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.472
Would she even be able
to reconcile the accounts

39:51.555 --> 39:53.891
if she doesn't have access
to the offshore servers?

39:53.974 --> 39:55.101
Okay, the point is…

39:56.352 --> 39:58.062
she's not our people anymore.

39:59.021 --> 40:02.233
And if she comes anywhere
near the casino, or this house,

40:02.316 --> 40:04.944
you stay away from her
and you let us know immediately.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.447
I've already spoken to Matt in security
and he's briefed every shift change.

40:08.948 --> 40:09.782
Good.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.744
-Good.
-[Charlotte chuckles]

40:15.913 --> 40:17.498
[Wendy] You spoken to Maya yet?

40:18.541 --> 40:20.042
No, she won't return my calls.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.295
Well, that's not good.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.589
I thought we were done with the FBI.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.050
Well, we're gonna need Maya's help

40:28.134 --> 40:31.345
because, uh, we have been asked to, uh…

40:31.429 --> 40:34.640
uh, essentially launder Omar Navarro.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.811
-[Jonah] That's impossible.
-No it's not.

40:38.894 --> 40:42.523
What exactly do you mean by "launder him"?

40:42.606 --> 40:46.485
Well, he wants to be free
to come and go between US and Mexico,

40:46.569 --> 40:48.487
uh, in return for…

40:48.571 --> 40:51.615
uh, I don't know, helping
the government when they need it.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.118
-It's just not possible.
-[Wendy] It is.

40:54.201 --> 40:57.288
[Marty] You know, the important thing is,
if all goes well, we have a promise

40:57.371 --> 40:59.457
that we're free
of our obligation to him, okay?

40:59.540 --> 41:02.126
In six months we could be
completely out from under this.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.085
Okay?

41:04.879 --> 41:09.592
Yeah, in third grade, we learned
about the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.928
There were like 600 acres
and on the grounds there's this building

41:13.012 --> 41:15.347
called the Hall for Prayer
for Good Harvests.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.225
It's circled by this thing
called the Echo Wall.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.687
-Okay. Okay, we get it.
-[Jonah] Even when people are whispering,

41:21.770 --> 41:24.899
you just hear the same things
repeated over and over--

41:24.982 --> 41:28.319
Okay, enough. You want to be a smart-ass?

41:28.402 --> 41:29.945
You want to hate me? Fine.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.072
But everything
your father is saying is true.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.366
And with our foundation,

41:34.450 --> 41:37.203
everything this family has sacrificed,

41:38.704 --> 41:39.997
everything,

41:40.080 --> 41:43.834
is gonna at least give us the power
to do whatever good we want to do.

41:44.960 --> 41:48.547
We-- We can be the most
powerful family in the Midwest.

41:49.048 --> 41:52.134
With the full endorsement
of the goddamn FBI to boot.

41:52.885 --> 41:55.262
People will find out
where the money came from.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.140
You need to grow up. This is America.

41:58.641 --> 42:01.352
People don't care
where your fortune came from

42:01.435 --> 42:03.062
and in two election cycles,

42:03.145 --> 42:06.148
it'll be just some… some myth,

42:06.232 --> 42:07.733
some gossip.

42:07.816 --> 42:10.069
Some fucking cocktail party.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.112
[knocking on sliding door]

42:14.698 --> 42:16.450
I think your doorbell's broken.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.161
Jesus Christ. This guy.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.498
We're having dinner, okay?

42:22.998 --> 42:24.667
[Mel] I-- I just need a second.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.710
Well, it's sacred time, we're eating.

42:29.630 --> 42:32.091
This is you, right? At Helen's house?

42:40.349 --> 42:43.185
I was angry because
she had my uncle committed.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.311
Jonah, be quiet.

42:45.938 --> 42:49.400
If you look at the rest of the footage,
you'll see she was alive when I left.

42:49.483 --> 42:50.609
Okay, enough.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.194
Why would you think she's dead?

42:52.278 --> 42:54.363
How'd you get this?
Did you have a warrant?

42:55.114 --> 42:59.034
I just show you a picture of your son
holding a shotgun on your business partner

42:59.118 --> 43:01.245
and that's what you're worried about,
a warrant?

43:01.328 --> 43:04.331
This is a… This is a family matter, okay?

43:04.415 --> 43:06.458
Look, I just need a signature, dude--

43:06.542 --> 43:09.169
Thank you for bringing it
to our attention. Good night.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.465
[Mel] I just need a signature!

43:15.634 --> 43:18.095
[Marty] Okay. I, uh--
I think that this is a time

43:18.178 --> 43:21.223
where we all just need to make sure
we don't lose our heads.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.726
-What the fuck were you doing?
-Wendy.

43:23.809 --> 43:26.979
I went there to shoot her
before she could kill our whole family.

43:27.646 --> 43:29.732
That's when she told me
what you did to Ben.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.151
-Did you know about this?
-Not that part.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.528
-Don't walk away.
-Where do you think you're going?

43:34.612 --> 43:36.280
-Out.
-[Wendy] No, you're not!

43:36.363 --> 43:38.699
[Marty] Hey, I'm serious.
This is all very complicated.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.701
We need to sit
and talk it out like a family.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.536
You're not leaving this fucking house!

43:42.620 --> 43:45.497
Can you calm down, please?
Everybody just stay calm.

43:46.332 --> 43:47.291
I am calm.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.752
All right, I'm completely calm.

43:50.961 --> 43:53.631
-And I know you can't stop me.
-Bullshit, I can't!

43:53.714 --> 43:56.508
-You're grounded.
-Can you dial that down just a tiny bit?

43:56.592 --> 43:59.094
You don't think attempted murder
is cause for grounding?

43:59.178 --> 44:01.013
[tense music playing]

44:01.096 --> 44:03.474
I have a key. You don't need to stay up.

44:09.021 --> 44:09.897
Don't!

44:44.807 --> 44:46.725
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry, I can go.

44:47.643 --> 44:50.854
No, I was serious. Anytime.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.398
Hey.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.316
Here. Catch.

44:56.902 --> 44:59.613
You know, I have my own software.

44:59.697 --> 45:00.948
For money laundering.

45:02.408 --> 45:05.035
And I made tweaks to my Dad's.
Mine's better.

45:06.537 --> 45:10.165
But the accounts have been up
and running for a while now, and you can…

45:10.249 --> 45:12.000
And you can have them if you want.

45:16.505 --> 45:17.840
Why would you do that?

45:23.637 --> 45:24.555
Thanks.

45:28.851 --> 45:32.396
You should probably know, I'm…
I'm working with Darlene.

45:33.439 --> 45:36.233
I know you guys had some shit in the past

45:36.734 --> 45:38.193
with your hair and all.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.655
[chuckles softly]
It looks good, by the way.

45:43.907 --> 45:44.783
You, um…

45:47.411 --> 45:49.037
You know she's crazy, right?

45:49.121 --> 45:50.122
[Ruth chuckles]

45:50.205 --> 45:51.707
Well, yeah.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.917
But who the fuck isn't?

45:54.001 --> 45:56.462
And this way, I got to work with Wyatt.

46:02.050 --> 46:02.885
Hey.

46:04.052 --> 46:07.890
Those accounts…
are they really up and running?

46:11.059 --> 46:12.519
You ever had a red flag?

46:14.271 --> 46:15.105
No.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.528
What if you did the laundering for me?

46:21.612 --> 46:23.989
You know, I bought the Lazy-O Motel.

46:25.699 --> 46:28.118
[chuckles] That's where
you first stole from us.

46:28.202 --> 46:31.288
It's a fucking perfect place
to run receipts through.

46:36.293 --> 46:39.046
Look, I um… I'm-- I'm not--

46:39.630 --> 46:40.672
I'm not sure.

46:41.256 --> 46:42.424
No, right.

46:43.133 --> 46:44.968
No, I mean, it's just…

46:45.844 --> 46:47.930
Seriously. Forget it.

46:49.765 --> 46:50.849
Um…

46:57.564 --> 46:59.900
You stay as long as you want.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.136
[phone buzzing]

47:35.352 --> 47:38.480
Hey, uh, Maya. It's Marty again.

47:38.564 --> 47:42.818
Uh, if you could, please call me back.
It's-- It's really important. Um…

47:42.901 --> 47:44.820
It's important for, uh, for me,

47:44.903 --> 47:46.780
um, for uh…

47:48.907 --> 47:50.075
for the uh…

47:51.535 --> 47:53.370
for the Bureau. Um…

47:55.372 --> 47:58.041
Anyway, call me back
when you can, please. Thank you.

48:02.838 --> 48:03.755
Hey, there.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.592
-[Javi] Hola.
-Hi, what a surprise.

48:07.342 --> 48:09.344
I was in Chicago for work. Uh…

48:10.053 --> 48:13.348
I have some new restaurant recommendations
for you and Wendy, by the way.

48:13.432 --> 48:14.933
[Marty] Oh. Thank you.

48:15.517 --> 48:18.687
Anyway, I figured I'd come
and check out the operation.

48:18.770 --> 48:20.689
-It's beautiful.
-[Marty] Well, yeah.

48:20.772 --> 48:22.482
So much classier than I imagined.

48:23.025 --> 48:23.901
Oh yeah?

48:24.735 --> 48:26.236
New Orleans style, huh?

48:27.321 --> 48:28.947
Um, yeah, it is.

48:30.115 --> 48:32.451
So, tell me.

48:33.952 --> 48:36.705
That hillbilly cunt.

48:37.873 --> 48:41.919
Does she still think she can
push her heroin in our backyard?

48:44.296 --> 48:45.339
You know what? Um…

48:47.174 --> 48:49.593
This place has been crawling with feds.

48:49.676 --> 48:51.929
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be here.

48:53.013 --> 48:55.682
Hmm. You're right. Mmm.

48:56.642 --> 48:57.893
We'll go to your place.

48:59.603 --> 49:00.437
My place?

49:01.396 --> 49:02.731
We can get pastries.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.461
[door opens and closes]

49:24.544 --> 49:25.921
[footsteps approaching]

49:30.801 --> 49:32.302
Where did you go last night?

49:33.136 --> 49:34.721
Why? So you can tell Mom and Dad?

49:35.305 --> 49:37.140
No, I'm just worried about you.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.357
I just rode my bike around.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.945
You need to get your shit together,
you're starting to scare me.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.572
Hey, their plan is make believe.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.575
-We need to give them time.
-We have.

49:56.910 --> 49:59.579
All Mom cares about is protecting us.

49:59.663 --> 50:04.668
Her killing Ben is the same as you
killing me. Can you imagine killing me?

50:06.586 --> 50:09.297
This is different. Ben was mentally ill.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.882
That's not an answer.

50:14.678 --> 50:17.347
Mom's right. You do need to grow up.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.560
[Jonah] And maybe you need
to get some opinions of your own.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.898
[door opens and slams shut]

50:41.246 --> 50:44.082
Javi was just wondering
how things were going with Darlene.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.460
I brought us pastries.

50:48.503 --> 50:50.338
[Wendy] That is so nice of you.
