WEBVTT

00:10.650 --> 00:11.707
Oh, hey, there.

00:11.708 --> 00:13.484
You want me to come over
and do that biology homework

00:13.485 --> 00:15.234
and rewrite
that history paper?

00:15.235 --> 00:17.574
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite catch that.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.772
You want to go shopping
and get a pedicure?

00:21.773 --> 00:23.608
That's what I
thought you said.

00:26.978 --> 00:29.667
No, no, and no!

00:33.541 --> 00:34.447
That was weird.

00:34.448 --> 00:35.264
I just had a vision

00:35.265 --> 00:37.174
of my parents
saying no.

00:37.641 --> 00:38.459
About what?

00:38.460 --> 00:39.718
Hello? They're parents.

00:39.719 --> 00:40.740
Do they need a reason?

00:41.141 --> 00:42.140
Let me see that.

00:42.141 --> 00:43.335
I don't want
to do that.

00:43.336 --> 00:44.578
I can't believe it.

00:45.801 --> 00:47.106
Chelsea, look.

00:47.522 --> 00:49.470
There's that cute guy
from the video store.

00:49.471 --> 00:51.575
Wait. He's in high school.
What's he doing here?

00:51.576 --> 00:53.304
I don't know,
but, uh, teeth check.

00:54.483 --> 00:55.871
You're good.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.040
Hey, Raven.

01:02.041 --> 01:04.910
Hey! Oh,
you know my name.

01:04.911 --> 01:07.332
Yeah, um, you rented
She's All That

01:07.333 --> 01:08.209
about two weeks ago.

01:08.210 --> 01:09.325
I sent you the
late notice.

01:09.326 --> 01:10.775
The one with the smiley face?

01:10.776 --> 01:11.992
Yeah, that's me.

01:11.993 --> 01:13.106
My name is Matthew.

01:14.226 --> 01:16.098
So, I'm here to pick
up my little sister.

01:16.099 --> 01:16.864
Why are you here?

01:16.865 --> 01:19.215
I'm here, you know,
I'm here to...

01:19.216 --> 01:21.874
to pick up
my little brother. Eddie?

01:21.875 --> 01:22.888
Mom told me
to give you

01:22.889 --> 01:23.975
a bath before dinner.

01:23.976 --> 01:24.865
Say what?

01:24.866 --> 01:25.625
You go make sure

01:25.626 --> 01:26.468
he does not wander.

01:26.469 --> 01:27.487
Thank you.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.371
Come on, Eddie.

01:28.372 --> 01:29.999
She's doing the most...

01:30.845 --> 01:32.075
Gosh, it's just...

01:32.076 --> 01:34.566
So, Raven, I know
we just sort of met

01:34.567 --> 01:36.475
but would you like
to do something with me

01:36.476 --> 01:37.706
Friday night
around 8:00?

01:38.587 --> 01:40.777
8:00. Um, I don't know, Matthew.

01:40.778 --> 01:42.401
That's kind of short notice.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.340
8:15?

01:43.341 --> 01:44.705
All right.

01:46.589 --> 01:49.796
I have a date Friday night,
and he's 17! Ooh!

01:49.797 --> 01:51.935
Rae, your parents are not going
to let you go out

01:51.936 --> 01:53.224
with a 17-year-old.

01:54.141 --> 01:55.787
Wait, Rae, that's
your vision!

01:55.788 --> 01:57.235
Your parents are
going to say no.

01:57.236 --> 01:58.687
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:58.688 --> 02:00.070
See, that's only the first no.

02:00.071 --> 02:03.005
Trick is you keep asking,
asking and asking.

02:03.006 --> 02:05.583
No, no, and no!

02:05.584 --> 02:06.844
Can't we talk
about this?

02:06.845 --> 02:08.437
I feel I'm not getting...

02:10.251 --> 02:12.205
I'm sorry. That was rude.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.576
Where was I again?

02:13.577 --> 02:15.141
Oh, yeah. No!

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:06.509 --> 03:07.671
Yep, that's me.

03:13.863 --> 03:15.807
I can't believe
they just walked out.

03:15.808 --> 03:17.934
I mean, they never listen
to anything I say.

03:17.935 --> 03:19.462
Do your parents
listen to you?

03:19.463 --> 03:22.044
Well, they kind of have to, Rae,
they're both therapists.

03:22.045 --> 03:24.908
I mean, it's just a little weird
when they tell me my time's up

03:24.909 --> 03:27.236
and they'll see me
next week, so...

03:27.934 --> 03:29.640
But, anyway, Rae,
well, you have to call him

03:29.641 --> 03:30.791
and you have to tell him
you can't go.

03:32.571 --> 03:34.065
I can't do it.
You do it.

03:34.066 --> 03:35.182
Okay.
No, I'll do it.

03:35.183 --> 03:36.703
That's silly.
No, you do it.

03:36.704 --> 03:37.987
No, I think
I should do it.

03:37.988 --> 03:38.678
No, you do it.

03:38.679 --> 03:39.566
Raven!

03:40.068 --> 03:43.106
If you didn't want to do it,
just say so.

03:48.971 --> 03:51.208
Hello, Matthew?

03:51.628 --> 03:54.075
Hey! Yeah, like, it's Chelsea--

03:54.076 --> 03:55.783
Raven's friend.

03:55.784 --> 03:58.822
And she, like, wanted
me to tell you that

03:58.823 --> 04:01.894
she, like, so can't
make it Friday night.

04:10.402 --> 04:12.610
But she'll be able to make
it, like, Saturday night.

04:12.611 --> 04:15.522
What?! Oh, yeah, so I
just wanted to let you know

04:15.523 --> 04:17.293
that you are,
like, so lucky

04:17.293 --> 04:17.920
because she had

04:17.921 --> 04:19.647
like, so many
offers that night.

04:19.648 --> 04:22.305
And so I'll see you two
lovebirds, all right?

04:22.306 --> 04:23.979
Like, good-bye.
Get off the phone.

04:25.164 --> 04:26.254
Okay, first of all

04:26.255 --> 04:30.055
I so don't talk that way,
and... hello?

04:30.056 --> 04:31.341
Your parents said
you can't go.

04:31.342 --> 04:33.212
Actually, I just
had a vision

04:33.213 --> 04:35.039
that my parents were dancing
in the living room

04:35.040 --> 04:37.448
and there's only one night
when they go dancing: Saturday.

04:37.449 --> 04:39.022
It's perfect.
They'll never know.

04:39.023 --> 04:41.308
Okay, well, let me make it
like, so un-perfect.

04:41.309 --> 04:43.451
When you're out on your date,
who's going to baby-sit Corey?

04:53.971 --> 04:56.201
Ah, our first night together...

04:58.141 --> 04:59.502
...baby.

05:18.371 --> 05:19.625
Man's good.

05:20.805 --> 05:23.810
But he's nothing
without his baby.

05:35.831 --> 05:37.717
Uh, you clean up
pretty good.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.940
Well, thank you
very much.

05:39.941 --> 05:42.189
Now, say something nice
about your mother.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.388
Mom, you look hot.

05:45.389 --> 05:47.876
See, I got a "hot."

05:47.877 --> 05:49.315
You just got a "pretty good."

05:50.503 --> 05:52.862
Well, that's because she
didn't see me do this.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.529
Now, that's hot.

05:57.126 --> 05:58.817
No, that's painful.

05:59.691 --> 06:01.728
That's because I
need to do my thing

06:01.729 --> 06:02.464
on the dance floor.

06:02.465 --> 06:05.832
I can't get my-my jiggy down
with a couch here.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.660
Oh, well, let's not waste
any valuable jiggy-down time.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.388
Now, listen, honey,
any problems

06:11.389 --> 06:13.033
you call me on my cell,
all right?

06:13.034 --> 06:14.741
Now, Victor, I see
what you're doing.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.390
If you think you can
rush me out that door...

06:16.391 --> 06:18.541
I want that popcorn cleaned up,
now, oh...

06:19.971 --> 06:21.871
Like I said,
the man is good.

06:23.866 --> 06:26.258
They're going out, and, um...

06:27.570 --> 06:28.906
...so am I.

06:29.732 --> 06:31.033
Check it out.

06:34.675 --> 06:36.200
It's my own creation.

06:36.201 --> 06:38.655
Looks like a jacket,
works like a...

06:38.656 --> 06:39.781
...purse.

06:40.948 --> 06:43.922
I got, uh, the cell phone,
the lip gloss

06:43.923 --> 06:46.072
the nail file,
and an extra roll

06:46.073 --> 06:46.750
just in case, you know

06:46.751 --> 06:48.549
I don't like the food
at the restaurant.

06:49.306 --> 06:50.790
Rae, you look gorgeous.

06:51.741 --> 06:54.005
You want to see
gorgeous, baby?

07:01.462 --> 07:02.837
I know.

07:02.838 --> 07:04.780
It's like a dream come true.

07:05.544 --> 07:06.844
Back it up,
Shaft.

07:07.706 --> 07:09.335
What's he doing here?

07:09.336 --> 07:10.700
Well, uh...

07:10.701 --> 07:12.870
I'll be your date
for this evening.

07:12.871 --> 07:15.705
I know. It's like a dream
come true, ain't it, sugar?

07:15.706 --> 07:17.871
Uh, no more, thanks.

07:22.578 --> 07:23.870
So...

07:23.871 --> 07:25.340
you drive a car.

07:25.341 --> 07:26.984
Ooh, that is so cool.

07:27.336 --> 07:28.520
Don't you drive?

07:29.952 --> 07:31.231
Yeah.

07:33.601 --> 07:39.027
But, you know, your car has...
that new car smell.

07:39.976 --> 07:41.206
It-It does?

07:41.538 --> 07:43.589
Well, it was my grandfather's.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.706
Well, you know, me,
I love the new car smell

07:48.707 --> 07:50.719
and the old people smell,
love 'em both.

07:51.390 --> 07:52.743
Smells great.

07:56.032 --> 07:57.856
Hey, man, what you doing
with that?

07:58.549 --> 08:00.305
Cleaning up the popcorn.

08:00.306 --> 08:01.659
Who am I fooling

08:01.660 --> 08:03.996
thinking Chelsea would ever like
a stupid little kid like me?

08:03.997 --> 08:05.235
Aw, man, look.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.775
Just give it
some time.

08:06.776 --> 08:09.025
Five years, you'll be 14.

08:09.026 --> 08:11.021
Then, of course,
Chelsea will be 19

08:11.022 --> 08:12.826
and she still won't be
looking your way.

08:13.741 --> 08:17.804
The good news is,
I'll be dating college girls.

08:19.053 --> 08:21.385
I was just impressed
you got the math right.

08:23.101 --> 08:24.792
Now could you help me
with this vacuum bag?

08:24.793 --> 08:25.746
It's a little full.

08:25.747 --> 08:26.957
All right.

08:29.541 --> 08:30.940
Hello?

08:30.941 --> 08:31.972
Oh, hi, Rae.

08:31.973 --> 08:34.251
You are so dead meat!

08:34.253 --> 08:35.640
Uh-oh. Hold on.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.595
Maybe you should go home
and take a shower.

08:42.596 --> 08:44.054
Forget it!

08:44.056 --> 08:45.965
I'm taking a shower right here!

08:45.966 --> 08:47.699
"Eddie, help me,
the bag is full."

08:47.700 --> 08:49.468
You little Oompa Loompa!

08:54.302 --> 08:56.208
Rae, when are you
coming home?

08:56.209 --> 08:58.653
Pretty soon if I keep
messing up on this date.

08:58.654 --> 08:59.762
He is so mature

08:59.763 --> 09:01.314
and I am acting
like such an idiot.

09:01.315 --> 09:02.775
You should have heard
the lame things I said

09:02.776 --> 09:03.522
about his car.

09:03.523 --> 09:05.538
He's going to figure out
I'm not 17.

09:05.539 --> 09:07.362
Look, Rae, just be
honest with him

09:07.363 --> 09:08.516
and tell him your real age.

09:08.517 --> 09:10.591
He's a nice guy.
I'm sure he'll understand.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.698
You don't get out much, do you?

09:16.541 --> 09:18.257
Look, Rae,
just let him

09:18.258 --> 09:19.284
do all the talking

09:19.285 --> 09:22.051
and-and you just...
you just sit there

09:22.052 --> 09:23.879
and-and look old.

09:25.115 --> 09:28.202
So, do tell me
about your life.

09:28.591 --> 09:29.572
You going to finish that?

09:29.573 --> 09:30.538
I was going
to put it...

09:30.539 --> 09:31.700
Okay, well,
you can take it.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.640
Rae, I love calamari.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.080
Now you know calamari's
just a fancy name for squid.

09:36.081 --> 09:37.734
"Ooh, save me from
the squid, Matthew!"

09:37.735 --> 09:38.958
"He big, he trying
to get me, Matt!"

09:38.959 --> 09:40.237
I'm going to save you, baby.

09:43.716 --> 09:47.260
Well, let's see...
I was born in San Francisco.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.177
My father's
name is Jerome.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.997
He's an optometrist.

10:01.381 --> 10:02.438
And when I was seven...

10:04.571 --> 10:06.635
I tried to join this one camp
in the woods.

10:06.636 --> 10:09.088
But, you know,
it was the whole...

10:09.762 --> 10:11.303
the whole wilderness thing,
you know?

10:13.008 --> 10:14.596
Just-just way too...

10:16.341 --> 10:18.155
...way too prehistoric
for a brother.

10:24.213 --> 10:25.635
What are you doing?

10:29.901 --> 10:31.861
You want to see what
I can do with a tablecloth?

10:31.862 --> 10:33.167
No.

10:36.884 --> 10:38.229
Matthew...

10:38.880 --> 10:39.842
I really hate

10:39.843 --> 10:42.479
to see this-this
wonderful evening end

10:42.480 --> 10:45.270
but, um,
I'm feeling kind of sick.

10:45.271 --> 10:47.188
Could you take me home?

10:47.189 --> 10:49.430
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.837
Um, just let me get the check.

10:50.838 --> 10:53.231
Waiter? Waiter?

10:53.232 --> 10:54.891
Waiter?
Waiter!

11:00.083 --> 11:01.218
I can't believe

11:01.219 --> 11:03.288
I split my pants
wide open.

11:03.289 --> 11:04.667
Just when I
was getting

11:04.668 --> 11:06.330
my jiggy down.

11:07.236 --> 11:10.622
And you're going to keep
your jiggy down. Sit.

11:12.122 --> 11:13.781
Change of plans. Sit.

11:13.782 --> 11:15.107
We're staying.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.438
But I thought you said
you felt sick.

11:16.985 --> 11:19.459
Sick. Yes, I do.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.253
Yeah, sick of the thought

11:21.254 --> 11:23.553
of ever letting
this date end.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.901
Look! Look, I'm a hockey goalie.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.074
Cool, cool.

11:27.075 --> 11:28.869
He goes left, goes right!

11:28.870 --> 11:30.967
Score! Yes!

11:30.968 --> 11:32.346
Who's your daddy?

11:46.067 --> 11:47.438
Opa!

11:47.439 --> 11:48.470
Opa!

11:48.471 --> 11:50.700
Opa! Whatever!

11:50.701 --> 11:52.446
No, I don't dance. No!

11:52.447 --> 11:54.022
Oh, I'm too short,
I'm too short!

11:54.023 --> 11:55.268
Okay, thank you.

11:55.269 --> 11:56.422
All right, thanks.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.833
Come on, I want
to get my opa on.

11:59.834 --> 12:01.782
Honey, if your pants
split any more

12:01.783 --> 12:03.332
everyone's going
to see your opa.

12:07.241 --> 12:08.905
Opa!

12:08.906 --> 12:10.100
Opa!

12:10.101 --> 12:15.027
Opa!

12:17.341 --> 12:18.771
Hi.

12:19.308 --> 12:20.304
Corey

12:20.305 --> 12:21.870
I told Raven I'd watch you

12:21.871 --> 12:24.075
and I can do that
whether you're alive or dead.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.943
Dead is less work.

12:27.033 --> 12:28.145
I know.

12:28.146 --> 12:29.820
Eddie's mad at me.

12:29.821 --> 12:31.515
You're mad at me.

12:31.516 --> 12:32.905
I'm sorry, okay?

12:34.383 --> 12:35.800
I'm listening.

12:35.801 --> 12:37.373
After Eddie gets out
of the shower

12:37.374 --> 12:38.583
how about I make some popcorn

12:38.584 --> 12:40.141
and the three of us
can watch a movie?

12:41.401 --> 12:43.141
And Eddie can sit in the middle.

12:43.779 --> 12:44.977
Okay.

13:16.093 --> 13:17.170
Smell good

13:17.171 --> 13:19.174
Smell good, yeah!

13:23.671 --> 13:25.220
Corey!

13:31.591 --> 13:34.801
If you don't open this door,
you little brat...!

13:37.401 --> 13:39.071
Let me out
of here!

13:42.471 --> 13:44.139
Open up, you...!

13:44.578 --> 13:45.743
Man!

13:53.529 --> 13:55.670
I'm gonna kill him!

14:02.671 --> 14:03.840
Opa!

14:03.841 --> 14:04.905
Opa!

14:04.906 --> 14:06.322
Opa!

14:06.323 --> 14:08.318
Opa!

14:14.071 --> 14:15.314
Hello?

14:15.828 --> 14:17.778
Oh, hi, Mrs. Baxter.

14:23.801 --> 14:25.980
Opa!

14:34.341 --> 14:36.274
Opa!

14:36.275 --> 14:37.686
Oh, puh-lease.

14:40.489 --> 14:42.439
Opa!
Opa!

14:45.408 --> 14:47.596
Come on, Eddie, don't be mad!

14:47.597 --> 14:49.234
Eddie!

14:49.235 --> 14:50.635
Eddie left?

14:50.636 --> 14:51.800
Yeah.

14:51.801 --> 14:53.493
He's still mad.

14:53.494 --> 14:54.748
I'm sorry.

14:54.749 --> 14:56.195
I'm such a jerk.

14:57.045 --> 14:59.357
No, Corey,
you're just a kid.

14:59.841 --> 15:01.628
Come on,
let's go watch that movie.

15:01.629 --> 15:04.575
You won't be ashamed to sit
on the same couch with me?

15:04.576 --> 15:06.029
No.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.270
I'll start the movie;
you get the sodas.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.084
Corey...
Get the sodas, be happy.

15:21.104 --> 15:22.569
I'll get you for that!

15:25.141 --> 15:27.067
Oh, yeah, now, baby!

15:27.068 --> 15:28.753
I'm gonna get you, man!

15:28.754 --> 15:30.156
I'm gonna get you!

15:32.918 --> 15:34.306
Hello?

15:34.720 --> 15:36.555
Oh, hi, Raven,
how's the date going?

15:36.556 --> 15:38.862
Girl, don't talk, just listen.
I had a vision.

15:38.863 --> 15:40.564
Whatever you do,
do not pick up the ph...

15:40.565 --> 15:42.264
Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on,
there's a call waiting.

15:42.265 --> 15:43.652
Chelsea, no!

15:43.653 --> 15:44.847
Hello?

15:46.066 --> 15:47.983
Oh, hi, Ms. Baxter.

15:49.341 --> 09:11.890
Uh, yeah, yeah, uh, hang on.

15:52.627 --> 15:53.687
Rae, it's your mom.

15:53.688 --> 15:55.094
She wants to know
where you are.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.218
Um, tell her
I'm on my way to the bathroom.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.360
Oh, okay, good one.

16:01.470 --> 16:05.756
Um, Ms. Baxter, um, Raven's
on her way to the bathroom.

16:07.566 --> 16:08.414
Okay.

16:09.438 --> 16:10.721
Rae, she told me
to tell you

16:10.722 --> 16:12.620
that you look
really nice tonight.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.771
Wait, how would
she know that?

16:28.122 --> 16:30.313
Trust me, girl,
she ain't psychic.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.138
Hey, Mom.

16:40.481 --> 16:42.252
Th-That was kind of funny,
you know?

16:42.253 --> 16:44.484
I was on the phone, and you were
on the phone, right?

16:44.485 --> 16:45.634
And, you know

16:45.635 --> 16:47.694
it's probably not really that
funny right at this moment

16:47.695 --> 16:49.375
but when we look back on it
a couple of years

16:49.376 --> 16:50.840
we'll be, like,
"That was funny!"

16:50.841 --> 16:52.915
Okay, I'm going to shut up now,
let you talk. Okay, talk.

16:53.769 --> 16:55.731
What is going on?

16:55.732 --> 16:57.178
I'm on a date.

16:57.179 --> 16:58.803
With whom?

16:59.331 --> 17:00.624
A guy named Matthew.

17:01.284 --> 17:02.775
You don't exactly know him.

17:02.776 --> 17:04.477
Well, that's one point
against you.

17:04.478 --> 17:05.556
Keep going.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.204
Well, actually,
I really didn't know him

17:07.205 --> 17:08.270
all that well either.

17:08.271 --> 17:10.915
I mean, if I knew
he was so disgusting

17:10.915 --> 17:12.319
I would have never
gone out with him

17:12.320 --> 17:13.267
in the first place.

17:13.268 --> 17:15.875
I mean, this was
the worst date of my life.

17:15.876 --> 17:17.166
I thought that
older guys

17:17.167 --> 17:18.827
were supposed to
be, like, cool.

17:18.828 --> 17:21.459
So, you went out with
an older boy you don't know?

17:21.460 --> 17:23.444
Two points.
Keep going.

17:24.887 --> 17:27.357
Oh... well, after you guys left

17:27.358 --> 17:29.128
he picked me up
to go out to dinner.

17:29.129 --> 17:31.505
And you rode with
him in a car?

17:31.506 --> 17:33.040
Yeah, I know, three points.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.584
No, actually, that's ten points.

17:35.585 --> 17:38.128
And now, here's Mom to tell you
what you've won.

17:38.129 --> 17:39.840
Oh, a ride home?

17:39.841 --> 17:41.500
Oh, you're going home

17:41.501 --> 17:43.570
but first I want to know
why you went out

17:43.571 --> 17:45.746
in the first place,
after we said no.

17:45.747 --> 17:47.302
Because, Mama,
you wouldn't listen to me.

17:47.303 --> 17:48.540
I was trying to explain.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.467
I mean, you never listen
to anything I say.

17:50.468 --> 17:51.375
That's not true!

17:51.376 --> 17:52.525
Mama, yes it is.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.387
I mean, if it's not exactly
what you want to hear

17:54.388 --> 17:55.805
then you just tune me out.

17:55.806 --> 17:56.640
What?!

17:56.641 --> 17:58.319
I am not listening to this.

17:59.443 --> 18:01.731
Mama, like that.

18:03.441 --> 18:05.063
Hey, baby, look.

18:05.741 --> 18:08.073
I am... Mr... Spock.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.570
Mom, if you love me

18:12.571 --> 18:14.771
you'll start dragging
my sorry butt home now.

18:15.569 --> 18:17.485
I want to talk to
your father first

18:17.486 --> 18:20.227
and then we'll just see
how sorry your butt is.

18:31.132 --> 18:33.290
Oh, look, it's my date
for this evening.

18:34.321 --> 18:38.312
Uh, now remember, man,
I'm wearing your pajamas.

18:46.946 --> 18:48.036
Where are you going?

18:48.610 --> 18:50.518
Home, with my parents
'cause...

18:51.203 --> 18:53.301
I forgot to tell you, I'm 14.

18:53.302 --> 18:54.414
I know.

18:54.415 --> 18:55.681
It's hard to believe.

18:58.776 --> 19:00.493
I'm so happy you've
given the check

19:00.494 --> 19:02.261
'cause I am so
ready to go.

19:02.262 --> 19:04.130
Well, actually, your mother
and I talked about it

19:04.131 --> 19:06.310
and we decided...
he's your ride home.

19:09.665 --> 19:11.133
You wanted this date?

19:11.134 --> 19:12.633
You got this date.

19:13.852 --> 19:15.284
Oh, are y'all serious?

19:16.229 --> 19:18.040
He is disgusting!

19:18.041 --> 19:19.835
Yeah, well, maybe
you'll think twice

19:19.836 --> 19:21.201
before you lie to us again.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.656
Oh, man!

19:30.101 --> 19:31.935
Hey, you know what?
I've been thinking.

19:31.936 --> 19:33.205
So what if you're 14?

19:33.206 --> 19:35.675
Your parents just ordered us
the Super Duper Opa.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.469
Super Duper Opa?

19:39.886 --> 19:42.126
Opa!

19:46.901 --> 19:49.028
Opa.
Opa.

19:51.741 --> 19:53.001
Now I don't want
to be a pig...

19:53.681 --> 19:54.981
so you can
get the spoon.

19:59.836 --> 20:01.525
Well, don't look at it, eat it.

20:08.131 --> 20:10.275
Okay, you can look
now-- he's finished.

20:10.276 --> 20:12.349
Did you see the way
he attacked that thing?

20:12.350 --> 20:14.445
It was like
feeding time at the zoo.

20:18.536 --> 20:21.305
If you love me, you'll
take me home now.

20:21.306 --> 20:22.932
Okay, fine, but first

20:22.933 --> 20:24.448
we're going to go over
a few rules.

20:24.449 --> 20:25.729
Now look, I understand

20:25.730 --> 20:27.677
that you're getting older,
and you want your independence

20:27.678 --> 20:29.676
but lying to us
is not the way.

20:29.677 --> 20:30.435
Got it.

20:30.436 --> 20:32.399
But your father and I
also realized

20:32.400 --> 20:34.201
that not taking time
to listen to you

20:34.202 --> 20:35.820
is also not cool.

20:36.774 --> 20:39.342
So, you know,
you're saying that this date

20:39.343 --> 20:40.734
is, like, officially over?

20:41.413 --> 20:43.765
I don't have to ride home
with him, do I?

20:43.766 --> 20:46.505
Sweetheart, you were never
going to ride home with him.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.947
Really?!

20:47.948 --> 20:49.877
Oh, you guys are good.

20:49.878 --> 20:52.267
And we just keep
getting better.

20:54.214 --> 20:56.163
It was very nice meeting you.

20:56.852 --> 20:58.449
Don't bother about getting up.

21:01.254 --> 21:02.874
Not that you could.

21:04.268 --> 21:06.065
Where does he put it all?

21:06.066 --> 21:07.539
I don't know, but we'd
better get out of here

21:07.540 --> 21:09.889
before he decides
to put it all back.

21:22.188 --> 21:22.878
I don't know.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.740
He just passed out
ten minutes into the movie.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.457
Well, let's
let him sleep.

21:28.001 --> 21:28.914
Good night.

21:29.241 --> 21:31.325
Chelsea, come on,
I'll drive you home.

21:31.326 --> 21:33.375
I'll tell you all
about it tomorrow.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.674
Okay.

21:37.241 --> 21:40.286
That's a really lovely
look for ya, Mr. Baxter.

21:46.616 --> 21:48.184
Hey, Corey, wake up.

21:48.185 --> 21:50.377
Someone wants to give you
a good-night kiss.

21:51.427 --> 21:52.722
Chelsea?

21:56.004 --> 21:57.860
Pucker up, Precious!
