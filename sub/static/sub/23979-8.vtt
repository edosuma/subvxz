00:01.040 --> 00:02.826
Stella: Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:02.870 --> 00:05.077
-You're under arrest.
-I tipped off the police.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.950
Oh, my God!
You got Aiden arrested?!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.628
In return for pleading guilty to
the lesser charge of possession,

00:09.670 --> 00:11.297
you'll spend one week
in county jail.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.583
You will also serve 150 hours
of community service.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.926
You're going
above and beyond,

00:15.970 --> 00:17.381
just like you did
when Stella was sick.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.137
I have to tell you,
I feel so...

00:20.140 --> 00:22.802
Sadie got accepted into
Dr. Freeman's clinical trial.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.228
That's amazing!

00:25.270 --> 00:29.059
And I can't stop
thinking about you

00:29.110 --> 00:32.273
I'm on fire

00:32.320 --> 00:33.981
Wes: If you ever look
at my wife like that again,

00:34.030 --> 00:35.316
I will not be
so polite next time.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.737
Okay, why don't we
just go inside --

00:36.780 --> 00:37.906
Will you get
your hands off me?!

00:38.870 --> 00:40.281
Wes: I got in a fight
with Dr. Grant.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.537
I saw how he looked at you,
how you looked at him.

00:42.580 --> 00:45.538
If you wanna be with me,
then you need to fix this.

00:45.580 --> 00:48.493
Why don't you listen They
say that time heals all wounds...

00:48.540 --> 00:51.123
When I tell you I can see Sadie: You
have to come see me. It's been too long.

00:51.170 --> 00:52.831
From the outside Oh, my God. You
should have heard Dr. Grant today.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.928
And I don't let it get to me
He was so funny.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.337
You were wrong,
you were wrong, you were wrong

00:57.390 --> 00:59.097
You should have walked away
...but it doesn't fix everything.

01:00.470 --> 01:03.929
Hey, you plan on
sleeping any time soon?

01:03.980 --> 01:06.847
I know it's hard sometimes
I sleep during the day.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.470
To do the things
you know you should

01:08.520 --> 01:10.648
It's a thin line
Cool.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.272
You want to do what feels good
And neither does running away.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.608
I don't blame you
Come on, let's go.

01:15.650 --> 01:16.856
I don't blame you
I can't go to school today.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.867
Skin and bones

01:18.910 --> 01:21.038
Skin and bones Buddy, why
don't you wanna go to school?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.367
This kid Jack's
been picking on him.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.451
Hey, are you awake?

01:28.500 --> 01:31.709
Sort of, Can I start talking
now or do you need a second?

01:31.750 --> 01:34.469
I could probably use --
We need a time machine.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.882
I'm sorry.

01:38.930 --> 01:40.807
What?
This is how we fix things.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.340
We go back
to before I met Dr. Grant,

01:42.390 --> 01:43.710
before I got this job.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.260
Everything was much
simpler back then.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.721
Plus, everyone listened
to better music.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.647
I think you're getting
a bit carried away,

01:48.690 --> 01:50.055
but, yes, I get it.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.851
There isn't an easy
way to fix this.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.392
And I don't know what else
I can do besides quit my job,

01:54.440 --> 01:55.737
and that seems totally crazy,

01:55.780 --> 01:57.100
because I would
never do anything

01:57.150 --> 01:58.652
when I was alone
with Dr. Grant

01:58.700 --> 02:00.771
that I wouldn't do
if you were right there with us.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.071
I would never
cheat on you, Wes.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.361
I know that.

02:07.410 --> 02:08.912
It's nice
to hear it, though.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.199
I wouldn't.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.371
Do you trust me?

02:13.420 --> 02:15.377
Yes.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.218
Yes, I trust you.

02:19.590 --> 02:22.218
But I don't trust him.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.095
Which meant I had to set
some boundaries at work.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.972
But first, I had to welcome
Aiden home from jail.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.027
-Hey , go o

02:40.070 --> 02:42.732
Are you okay
Do you have any new tattoos?

02:42.780 --> 02:44.111
If you do,
I am not gonna judge.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.151
But it does help me
to see them early.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.908
No tattoos, no problems.
Wasn't that bad.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.746
Well, I've really
missed having you here.

02:50.790 --> 02:51.951
You don't
have to say that.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.741
I know I don't.
But I really did.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.792
Guys, I'm fine.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.330
Seriously, it was a week
in county jail,

03:00.380 --> 03:01.882
not seven years in Tibet.

03:01.930 --> 03:04.592
I'm beat. I wanna go take
a nap in my own bed.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.725
I appreciate the welcome,
but, please, live your lives.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.908
Hey, Stella.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.815
You're not supposed
to be here today.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.066
Dr. Russo's here today.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.610
Dr. Russo, you're here,
aren't you?

03:24.660 --> 03:26.367
I am here.
Well, I'm here, too.

03:26.410 --> 03:28.902
And sometimes stuff like
that happens in hospitals.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.361
Hey, how's your brother?
Don't do that.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.208
Don't ask me about my family.
We can't be friends.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.332
My husband hit a wall.
You were there. Remember?

03:35.380 --> 03:36.791
He told you?

03:36.840 --> 03:38.160
Yeah, of course he told me.
We're married.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.621
Okay. Got it.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.377
Our relationship
is strictly professional now.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.831
As far as I'm concerned,
it was always professional.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.927
That's right, you laid
down the law, Stella,

03:45.970 --> 03:47.711
and made the perfect exit.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.842
Unfortunately, you need to go
in the other direction.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.685
You heard me.

03:55.690 --> 03:56.646
Atta girl.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.811
Don't worry about a thing

04:01.860 --> 04:05.569
You'll learn to live again

04:05.620 --> 04:07.440
You're gonna learn
to live again

04:07.490 --> 04:11.529
Oh, oh, oh

04:12.750 --> 04:14.661
Excuse me,

04:14.710 --> 04:16.997
but may I consult with you
on a professional matter?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.247
What do you want?
It's about Sadie.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.916
I will allow it.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.870
Well, she's supposed to start
her clinical trial next week,

04:22.930 --> 04:24.546
but they wanna run
tests today in Seattle

04:24.590 --> 04:27.469
and her aunt can't make it,
so now she's refusing to go.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.592
What do you mean? She has to go.
This trial could save her life.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.381
And I tried to tell her that,
but she won't listen to me.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.728
I was hoping that maybe
you could, you know,

04:33.770 --> 04:35.260
work your magic,
talk to her.

04:35.310 --> 04:36.607
No problem.
I'll do that right now.

04:36.650 --> 04:37.890
Okay.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.396
I know
where her room is.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.156
Okay.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.533
Did you know that Jack has been
picking on Frank at school?

04:49.580 --> 04:52.447
I didn't. No.
Well, it's gotten bad.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.615
I mean, it started off
with teasing,

04:53.660 --> 04:56.129
but now Jack
has pushed Frank.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.877
Well, I'm sorry,
but how do you know that?

04:57.920 --> 04:59.126
My daughter told me.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.740
And you believe her
because...?

05:00.800 --> 05:04.259
Because...
she's not a liar.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.758
Kids make things up
all the time, Lizzie, I mean --

05:06.800 --> 05:10.714
Not my kids. So, we should
think of a solution.

05:10.760 --> 05:14.094
I think we should let
the kids just work it out.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.973
I'm not really into helicopter
parenting like you are.

05:18.310 --> 05:20.859
And I'm late
for yoga, so...

05:25.200 --> 05:27.737
[ Man speaking
indistinctly in distance ]

05:30.080 --> 05:33.243
Well, as far as mandatory
community service goes,

05:33.290 --> 05:35.247
this doesn't look so bad.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.247
Mom, they're gonna
make me build stuff...

05:37.290 --> 05:38.451
with my body.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.299
Oh, come on.
That'll be fun.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.253
Look at all
these criminals.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.621
You think any of them
have killed people?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.580
Oh, that guy
looks shifty.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.096
They're not
all criminals.

05:50.140 --> 05:51.676
Most of these people
are volunteers.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.210
Well, even better.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.591
They'll share their joy
of a hard day's work.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.143
I'm not really a
"hard day's work" kind of guy.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.726
I have soft hands, Mom.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.148
That is one of the things
that women love most about me.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.851
Oh! Stay.

06:07.490 --> 06:09.561
Don't forget these!

06:09.620 --> 06:12.408
What am I supposed to do
with a tray of muffins?

06:12.450 --> 06:14.361
Share them
with the convicts.

06:14.410 --> 06:17.323
Muffins mean "Hello."

06:17.370 --> 06:19.873
And "Please
don't shiv me."

06:19.920 --> 06:21.786
I love you.
Okay.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.708
-I love you so much!
-Stop. Bye.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.923
Make good choices...
for once.

06:28.970 --> 06:32.258
Sorry, I...
couldn't help but see that.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.348
Did your mom just
give you muffins?

06:34.390 --> 06:36.631
No, I'm just holding
onto these for warmth.

06:38.730 --> 06:41.518
I'm Allie.
Volunteer.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.221
Aiden.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.523
Also a volunteer.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.861
You're not gonna
change my mind.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.366
If you don't
get these tests, Sadie,

06:55.410 --> 06:56.366
you can't do the trial.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.868
I know.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.617
I don't know
anyone up there.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.129
And doctors never know
how to explain anything.

07:04.170 --> 07:06.548
That's what my aunt does.
I get that.

07:06.590 --> 07:09.218
But there's a waiting list
a mile long for this trial,

07:09.260 --> 07:10.421
so if you don't
give it a shot now,

07:10.470 --> 07:12.677
someone will take
your place.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.257
And you'll never know if you
missed out on a miracle.

07:15.310 --> 07:19.053
And trust me,
miracles happen.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.511
I'll only go...

07:22.860 --> 07:24.430
<i>...if you come with me.</i>

07:24.480 --> 07:27.222
Then I will come with you.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.021
It'll be fun.

07:33.740 --> 07:36.289
Or it will be
a total disaster.

07:47.090 --> 07:48.080
You couldn't give a girl
a warning

07:48.130 --> 07:48.915
that you were driving?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.667
Don't get mad at me.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.960
I asked you to talk her
into coming, not come with her.

07:52.010 --> 07:53.580
She said she'd only go
if I came.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.347
So, come.
I can't come.

07:55.390 --> 07:57.848
So, don't come. I have
to come or Sadie won't go.

07:57.890 --> 08:00.678
<i>I don't know what to tell you. Just
get in the car. I have to call Wes.</i>

08:02.140 --> 08:06.600
Look, I know it's not
an ideal situation.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.778
You of all people know
how hard it'll be

08:08.820 --> 08:11.482
for Sadie to take this leap
into the unknown.

08:11.530 --> 08:13.066
When I did my trial,
you were there for me

08:13.110 --> 08:14.566
and that's part of the reason
I think it worked.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.270
Sadie -- She doesn't have
this kind of support.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.445
She needs me.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.650
Wes?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.078
Are you okay?
-It's fine. I understand.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.530
Stella,
we have to get going.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.048
I love you, Wes.
And I'm so sorry.

08:34.510 --> 08:36.136
I'll -- it'll call you
from the road.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.768
You are not a helicopter.
Damn right, I'm not.

08:43.809 --> 08:44.936
I am a tank.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.971
And I will run her down.

08:47.020 --> 08:49.478
What size trash bag do we need
to hold a human body?

08:49.520 --> 08:51.272
Okay, I know how you feel,

08:51.320 --> 08:54.563
but I don't think we should be
fighting violence with violence.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.612
Though Mama Bear Lizzie
IS very sexy.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.737
And let's deal with this
through the proper channels.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.610
I...
I will call the principal,

09:02.660 --> 09:04.742
and we can all sit down
and work it out, okay?

09:07.170 --> 09:08.911
You're right.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.587
We will do this your way.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.007
Thank you.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.791
Now, would you mind saying
"you're right" one more time,

09:15.840 --> 09:17.717
because it's
So nice to hear.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.670
Unh-unh.

09:27.020 --> 09:31.309
GPS Voiceover:
Go straight for 137 miles.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.026
Maybe we could listen
to some tunes?

09:36.070 --> 09:38.232
Sure.
Yeah, that's fine with me.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.157
I trade my soul for a wish
Oh, my... man, this song...

09:40.200 --> 09:41.736
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
Yeah, talk about overplayed.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.191
I wasn't looking for this
Right?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.866
But now you're in my way I mean,
you can change it if you want to.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.379
Your stare was holdin'
No, I don't care.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.707
Ripped jeans, skin was
showin' It's -- It's totally up to you.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.332
Hot night, wind was blowin'
I can live with it, if you can.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.087
Yeah. Where you
think you're going, baby

09:54.130 --> 09:56.462
All: Hey, I just met you

09:56.510 --> 09:58.421
And this is crazy

09:58.470 --> 10:00.381
But here's my number

10:00.430 --> 10:02.501
So call me, maybe

10:02.560 --> 10:04.597
It's hard to look right

10:04.640 --> 10:06.381
At you, baby

10:06.440 --> 10:08.431
But here's my number

10:08.480 --> 10:10.187
So call me, maybe

10:10.230 --> 10:11.812
Oh!

10:12.940 --> 10:16.774
This is my third build.
I love it so much.

10:16.820 --> 10:17.855
What about you?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.026
It's my first.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.401
Keep pushing, people!

10:20.450 --> 10:22.521
I want to get this
framed out by lunch!

10:22.580 --> 10:24.446
Supervisor's
pretty tough, huh?

10:24.490 --> 10:26.072
She just doesn't like
to waste time.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.077
That's a shame, 'cause
I could be the spokesperson

10:28.120 --> 10:29.246
for wasting time.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.951
I don't believe that
for a second.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.411
You're here, aren't you?

10:32.460 --> 10:33.996
Just trying to do
some good in the world.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.588
Hey, do-gooder.
Shoe's untied.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.261
Right here.

10:47.310 --> 10:48.971
Oh, wait.
I want in this.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.478
<i>Ready?
And.. field trip crew!</i>

10:52.730 --> 10:55.222
Aw, cute.
I like that one.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.736
All right,
I'll send it to you.

10:56.780 --> 10:59.272
And I think I'll
grab some snacks.

11:03.450 --> 11:05.578
So, that was fun.
No, it wasn't.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.782
Seriously, you don't have to
deny that you were having fun.

11:07.830 --> 11:10.413
It's pretty obvious
that you were. Fine.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.122
But I was having fun with Sadie.
I was not having fun with you.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.707
Okay. Whatever you say,
Mighty Mouse.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.412
And that's another thing,
no more nicknames.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.258
I'm really starting to regret
you coming on this trip.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.383
So, you did
want me to come.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.512
What? You sent
me to talk to Sadie,

11:26.560 --> 11:28.301
hoping that I'd come
with you, didn't you?

11:28.350 --> 11:30.387
No. No, I did not.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.841
Honestly, I don't know
what to believe anymore

11:32.900 --> 11:34.811
after what you did
in that bar.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.350
What I did in the bar?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.028
I saw the way
that you looked at me.

11:39.070 --> 11:40.856
Yeah, I only looked
at you that way

11:40.900 --> 11:43.153
because you were looking right
back at me the exact same way.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.520
No, I was not.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.072
The only was I was
looking at you was like,

11:46.120 --> 11:48.361
"Hey, that guy's up there
singing," because you were.

11:48.410 --> 11:49.900
And where else was
I supposed to look?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.917
You were up on a stage,
my body was facing that stage,

11:51.960 --> 11:53.416
and my eyeballs were
pointed in that direction

11:53.460 --> 11:54.837
because I have human face.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.417
I'm not a deer or some
sort of prey animal.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.919
You know you only talk this much
when you're nervous, right?

12:00.970 --> 12:02.005
Why you nervous?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.387
I'm not nervous.

12:05.430 --> 12:07.341
And you need to quit acting
like you know me so well

12:07.390 --> 12:09.347
because you don't.
If you keep talking like this,

12:09.390 --> 12:11.802
I am gonna quit the hospital
and I'm never gonna come back.

12:11.850 --> 12:14.512
You're quitting?

12:14.560 --> 12:17.564
Oh. No, sweetie.
I'm...

12:17.610 --> 12:19.851
Look what you did.
Wait, what I did?

12:19.900 --> 12:21.106
Yeah. No, I'm not the one
who gave a whole monologue

12:21.150 --> 12:22.857
about the situation.
Oh, really?

12:22.900 --> 12:24.356
Well, you're the one...

12:31.790 --> 12:34.168
Will; Stay here
and get warm, okay?

12:34.210 --> 12:35.951
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.879
It was just a panic attack,
but her pulse is still racing.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.621
How you doing?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.170
Fine.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.632
Is your tongue pressed
against the roof of your mouth?

12:48.680 --> 12:51.559
How'd you know?
It's an anxiety thing.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.728
I've been there.

12:53.770 --> 12:57.058
We are part of a club
that nobody wants to be in.

12:59.270 --> 13:01.739
I wanna go home.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.316
Can we make
one stop first?

13:05.820 --> 13:07.561
I don't want
to do the trial.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.655
Okay.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.499
New plan -- I'm driving.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.996
Wait, I only have
a scooter license.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.246
You're driving, but I'm
telling you where to go.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.950
Diego: Look, I'm sorry that
you have you to spend the day

13:18.000 --> 13:19.741
thinking about her
in a car with that guy.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.246
Yeah.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.665
Am I helping?
Not in the slightest.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.007
Oh, okay. Got it.

13:24.050 --> 13:26.508
Hey. Are you Diego?

13:26.550 --> 13:27.927
Uh, yeah.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.096
You wanna tell me
why I got a call

13:29.140 --> 13:30.460
from the principal's office

13:30.510 --> 13:32.638
asking me to go in
and talk about your son?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.307
You're Todd,
Jack's dad.

13:34.350 --> 13:36.933
And you must be the little man
who sent his wife to my house

13:36.980 --> 13:38.436
to handle
your business for you.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.767
Uh, first of all,
my size is average,

13:40.820 --> 13:44.358
and, uh, second, nobody
sends Lizzie anywhere.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.198
If you met her, you would --
you would know that.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.562
Whatever. Look, boys
will be boys, okay?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.940
I don't have time
to get involved

13:50.990 --> 13:52.981
in kindergarten
play fighting.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.452
Well, you have time
to join a kickball league.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.628
Let's go
warm up, yeah?

13:58.670 --> 13:59.626
Okay.

14:05.630 --> 14:07.257
You have a good day,
muffin man?

14:07.300 --> 14:09.007
I did, actually.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.212
Thanks for not blowing my cover
with the lady friend back there.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.716
Oh, I will never.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.808
You've clearly got her
heart on house arrest.

14:14.850 --> 14:17.558
Ha-ha. That's funny.
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:19.190 --> 14:20.726
Hey, you heading home?

14:20.770 --> 14:23.774
Just for a few, then I'm
meeting up with some friends.

14:23.820 --> 14:29.190
Hey, do you wanna join us?
I must ask if it's after 8:00.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.867
Yeah. Why?

14:30.910 --> 14:32.821
Why not just go right now?

14:32.870 --> 14:35.658
I was actually planning
on going home first.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.362
Or we could just
go to my home.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.821
That was too forward.
Unless it wasn't.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.666
Are you okay?
I don't know.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.667
Are you afraid
of the dark or something?

14:44.710 --> 14:46.451
That's ridiculous.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.968
No, it's just that
you're so pretty,

14:49.010 --> 14:50.250
I wanna be able
to see your face,

14:50.300 --> 14:52.758
and that is hard
to do in the dark.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.347
So...

14:54.390 --> 14:55.846
will I see you later?

14:55.890 --> 14:59.190
No. You will not.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.346
I have a thing.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.390
Yep.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.977
Okay.

15:08.610 --> 15:10.271
Really?

15:10.320 --> 15:11.902
-Come on!
-Let's go, D!

15:17.370 --> 15:18.906
Ah!

15:21.250 --> 15:23.491
Great, good job!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:26.000 --> 15:27.707
Come on, D, let's go!

15:34.760 --> 15:36.091
Oh!

15:37.810 --> 15:38.880
Oh!

15:42.940 --> 15:44.351
Boys will be boys.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.765
Woman:
Is he okay?

15:56.950 --> 15:58.111
Hey, do you mind
waiting here?

15:58.160 --> 15:59.537
I want to show
Sadie something.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.617
Take your time.
Where are we going?

16:01.670 --> 16:03.411
I'm wanna grab you
a little luck.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.373
I told you I wasn't
doing the trial.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.797
I know.
That doesn't mean

16:07.840 --> 16:09.956
you couldn't use
a little luck anyway.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.839
This is the darkest sky
in the northwest.

16:15.890 --> 16:18.712
I came here
before my trial.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.511
The one that save you?

16:20.560 --> 16:22.187
Yep.

16:22.230 --> 16:23.300
How'd you find this place?

16:23.350 --> 16:25.899
I didn't,
My husband did.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.102
Just a little bit farther.

16:28.150 --> 16:29.777
Where are you taking me?

16:29.820 --> 16:32.778
Ooh, are you taking me
to a fancy outdoor restaurant?

16:32.820 --> 16:34.652
Keep walking.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.481
Do I hear raccoons?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.032
Uh, I grew up in London,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.401
so I do not know
what they sound like.

16:41.450 --> 16:45.705
All right,
and we are...

16:47.960 --> 16:50.668
...here.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.292
You brought me into
the middle of the woods?

16:52.340 --> 16:54.251
Are you gonna murder me?

16:54.300 --> 16:58.385
Then you're crying, then
you can't decide Look up.

16:58.430 --> 17:03.300
My life's uncertain and
sometimes strange Whoa.

17:03.350 --> 17:10.564
The one thing I've learned is it won't
stay the same... Wes, this is amazing.

17:10.609 --> 17:12.646
So, I thought that you

17:12.690 --> 17:15.660
could use a little luck
before your trial.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.159
And I know you think
we make our own luck,

17:19.200 --> 17:20.736
but I also know
that you don't have

17:20.790 --> 17:23.828
such a strict policy
on wishes.

17:23.869 --> 17:29.991
So, I thought that we could
make a wish on a shooting star.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.246
There's a meteor
shower tonight,

17:31.300 --> 17:34.042
so there should be
a lot of them.

17:34.090 --> 17:36.252
Tangled in my hair

17:36.300 --> 17:38.849
Crazy how much
my life has changed

17:38.890 --> 17:41.382
In just a year

17:41.430 --> 17:44.172
There's people I've met,
people I've left

17:44.230 --> 17:47.188
And some that
didn't make it here

17:47.230 --> 17:51.349
Hey...
You okay?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.858
I wanna make a wish.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.698
I just don't wanna get
my hopes up again.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.698
And you can't decide

17:58.740 --> 18:02.779
I have to accept the fact
that I'm really dying.

18:02.830 --> 18:05.208
The one thing I've learned
We're all dying, babe.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.493
Is it won't stay the same

18:08.540 --> 18:11.373
Even in the darkness
Just not tonight, right?

18:11.420 --> 18:13.878
I'll be okay
No. Not tonight.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.582
The sun will come up

18:16.630 --> 18:19.258
The seasons will change

18:19.300 --> 18:22.053
The sun will come up

18:22.100 --> 18:24.717
The seasons will change
Right there!

18:24.770 --> 18:27.478
The sun will come up
You see it?

18:27.520 --> 18:30.091
The seasons will change
Yeah.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.972
The sun will come up

18:33.020 --> 18:34.931
The seasons will change

18:34.980 --> 18:37.893
And when I saw
that shooting star,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.658
I thought maybe
I did have a shot.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.493
So, now we wait?
As long as it takes.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.631
Ah! There he is.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.717
Hey, I'm gonna
grab a shower.

19:09.140 --> 19:12.360
He's really not
talking to me anymore.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.606
Well, he was in jail
for a week,

19:13.650 --> 19:15.357
and you put him there.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.141
All things considered,

19:17.190 --> 19:20.603
I think that your relationship
is doing surprisingly well.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.697
I just wish he'd open up
to me a little.

19:24.740 --> 19:26.788
Well, you were
never that close.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.787
You're right.
We weren't.

19:28.830 --> 19:30.457
But we were getting there.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.786
Now, I don't know.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.289
Well, it's a process, Peter.
I know. I just miss him.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.386
And I miss you.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.018
I've been thinking
about our Kiss.

19:48.060 --> 19:50.552
I've been thinking
about that, too.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.479
_ I was lost
IN a moment, Peter.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.932
And I think that we both
know that moment is over.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.988
Right.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.522
Of course.

20:02.570 --> 20:05.733
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.906
Hmm.

20:08.620 --> 20:09.746
Will: So, how'd it go?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.959
I... think I'm ready
to give it a shot.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.991
Does that mean...
She's in.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.620
Excellent. Okay, well,

20:18.670 --> 20:20.502
I called Dr. Freeman,
just in case,

20:20.550 --> 20:23.713
and, uh, he agreed
to see you in the morning.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.138
And your aunt gave us permission
to get a couple motel rooms

20:26.180 --> 20:27.841
if -- if you're up for it.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.301
I'm up for it.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.727
Stella?

20:33.390 --> 20:36.018
Yeah.
'Course. Yes.

20:36.060 --> 20:40.019
Just...got to make a super-fun
phone call first.

20:42.820 --> 20:45.653
Sunny D,
got to say,

20:45.700 --> 20:47.657
it means a lot that you guys
are making such an effort

20:47.700 --> 20:49.361
to hang out with me.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.572
You kidding?
You're family.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.668
We're your
after-8:00 crew.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.996
Good, 'cause you're
all I got,

20:55.040 --> 20:58.704
unless I can find a girl
with a 7:45 bedtime.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.337
Hey, so what'd it feel like
to level that jackass, huh?

21:03.380 --> 21:05.041
Todd got
what he deserved.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.296
Hmm.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.017
There's something
wrong with this beer.

21:12.060 --> 21:14.267
It's nonalcoholic.

21:14.310 --> 21:15.345
That would be it.

21:22.150 --> 21:25.404
So, apparently, Stella is
spending the night up there.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.481
Something came up.

21:28.530 --> 21:31.739
Hey, Wes,
my sister loves you.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.246
She would never
do anything --

21:33.290 --> 21:35.418
Uh-oh.

21:36.370 --> 21:38.372
Hello? Okay.

21:38.420 --> 21:41.082
Okay, slow down, slow down.

21:41.130 --> 21:42.757
Why?

21:42.800 --> 21:45.167
Yeah. No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I will be home as soon as I can.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.006
What --
What's going on?

21:47.050 --> 21:48.540
Todd's in the hospital.

21:50.300 --> 21:54.976
So, do you wanna have a pillow
fight or a...dance party?

21:55.020 --> 21:57.307
We should trash this place.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.433
I don't know what people do
in hotel rooms on field trips.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.187
Sneak into the boys' room?

22:02.230 --> 22:04.028
That is not happening.

22:05.530 --> 22:07.908
Stella, you know you
can talk to me, right?

22:07.950 --> 22:09.270
I'm not a little kid.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.072
I don't know what you mean.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.283
Okay, because it seems to me
that Dr. Grant likes you.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.958
And he's really
cool and super-hot.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.789
I'm sorry, how old did
you say you were again?

22:20.840 --> 22:21.739
Is Wes hot, too?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.792
Yes, he is.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.080
Ooh, wow.

22:27.130 --> 22:29.633
I see how this
is hard for you.

22:29.680 --> 22:32.752
It's not hard for me.
I love Wes.

22:32.810 --> 22:37.555
And I'm -- I'm really
happy with him, but...

22:37.600 --> 22:38.806
But?

22:41.190 --> 22:43.773
It's just not
the perfect fairytale

22:43.820 --> 22:45.310
I always hoped it would be

22:45.360 --> 22:49.069
when I was dreaming about it
from my hospital bed.

22:49.110 --> 22:53.024
Turns out that
real life, real love...

22:53.080 --> 22:55.321
it's way more
complicated than that.

22:55.370 --> 22:58.749
If it makes you
feel any better...

22:58.790 --> 23:01.532
I've never even
had a boyfriend.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.491
And I may not get to.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.622
Hey, don't talk like that.

23:06.590 --> 23:11.084
You have a lot
of life to live.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.596
We probably should've

23:12.640 --> 23:15.132
stuck with the pillow fight
after all, huh?

23:15.180 --> 23:17.922
Nah. I like talking
to you better.

23:24.020 --> 23:25.010
Oh!

23:26.070 --> 23:28.528
Oh, my goodness!

23:50.930 --> 23:52.967
-Oh, hey.

23:53.010 --> 23:55.502
I-I wasn't actually
expecting you to answer.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.959
I've been calling you
for days.

23:57.010 --> 24:00.890
Yeah, well, I've been
ignoring you for days.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.759
How are you?

24:01.810 --> 24:03.437
Good.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.222
Settling into the new job
in San Francisco.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.398
You?

24:08.440 --> 24:09.601
I've been better.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.391
Yeah, I see that.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.067
You've got that sad eyebrow
thing of yours going on.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.979
You called to mock me?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.940
Of course.
I'm English.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.618
But I also wanted
to run something by you.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.126
Do you have a minute?

24:25.170 --> 24:26.911
I've got all night.

24:33.890 --> 24:37.884
I can't even avoid you
for five minutes, can I?

24:37.930 --> 24:39.466
Guess not.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.978
<i>Well, I just
needed some air.</i>

24:42.020 --> 24:44.011
And now I've received some,
SO...

24:44.060 --> 24:45.221
Hey, how's Sadie?

24:49.320 --> 24:50.856
She's good.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.857
What are you guys
up to?

24:52.900 --> 24:55.449
We just polished off
the mini-bar,

24:55.490 --> 24:56.946
gossiping about boys.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.409
She's never had
a boyfriend and...

25:05.460 --> 25:07.747
she's afraid she'll never
get the chance to.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.042
Nah, she will.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.206
She's gonna date
all sorts of boys.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.718
I mean, not --
not all sorts.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.250
Hopefully,
just the right sorts.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.268
She deserves that.

25:22.310 --> 25:24.688
She does.

25:24.730 --> 25:26.095
Stella, I don't know
what you did

25:26.150 --> 25:29.609
back there in the woods,
but...

25:29.650 --> 25:30.970
I think you might have
saved her life.

25:31.030 --> 25:31.815
I...

25:31.860 --> 25:33.100
I don't know.

25:33.150 --> 25:34.527
I think you might be
saving mine, too.

25:34.570 --> 25:36.197
Don't say that.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.618
No, I'm serious.

25:38.660 --> 25:41.698
I've seen how...
positive you are

25:41.740 --> 25:45.859
after everything
you've been through.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.628
You inspire me.,

25:48.670 --> 25:50.331
You give me hope.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.667
You know, Will, I...

25:54.720 --> 25:56.119
What?

25:56.180 --> 26:00.674
Nothing.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.633
I shouldn't
be out here.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.808
Yet, here you are.

26:05.850 --> 26:07.682
And now...

26:07.730 --> 26:09.357
here I go.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.732
Goodnight.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.441
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.706
I mean, I --
I have to do something.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.206
Please don't
beat yourself up, D.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.127
It was an accident.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.549
It wasn't.

26:34.590 --> 26:36.718
What do you mean,
"it wasn't"?

26:36.760 --> 26:38.671
I mean
I hurt him on purpose.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.882
What happened to not fighting
violence with violence?

26:40.930 --> 26:43.467
I hadn't met the guy yet.
Diego!

26:43.510 --> 26:44.557
I got to go
to the hospital.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.136
And say what?

26:46.180 --> 26:47.386
I don't know.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.510
"I'm sorry"?

26:48.560 --> 26:50.392
For intentionally
hurting him?

26:50.440 --> 26:52.727
What were you thinking,
Diego?

26:52.770 --> 26:55.023
Hey, if you admit this,
then you're responsible.

26:55.070 --> 26:56.890
I am responsible,
either way.

26:56.940 --> 26:59.443
Right, but legally
responsible.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.777
You've gotta stop and think
about this for a second, okay?

27:01.820 --> 27:04.869
They could sue us.
We could lose everything.

27:04.910 --> 27:07.572
I have to.
Diego, hey...

27:07.620 --> 27:10.829
- This is our lives.
This is our children's lives.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.247
You can't admit that
you did this.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.347
You okay up there?

27:22.390 --> 27:24.006
Aiden: I'm fine!
I don't wanna talk about it!

27:24.060 --> 27:26.768
Okay.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.020
Son?

27:37.070 --> 27:38.481
Would you like
to talk about it?

27:38.530 --> 27:40.020
Fine.

27:40.070 --> 27:41.777
I'll come down.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.609
How's it going?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.739
You know the feeling
when you meet a hot girl

27:56.800 --> 27:58.199
and they're really
into you,

27:58.260 --> 27:59.125
and they wanna hang out
with you at night,

27:59.170 --> 28:00.797
but you can't 'cause...

28:00.840 --> 28:02.126
you're wearing
an ankle bracelet?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.501
Of course.
That's a tale as old as time.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.132
Okay, never mind.

28:08.350 --> 28:09.511
What happened?

28:09.560 --> 28:11.050
Nothing.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.512
That's the problem.
I couldn't close the deal.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.800
Turns out, loss of mojo's

28:14.860 --> 28:16.601
an unforeseen condition
of my parole.

28:16.650 --> 28:18.186
Aiden,
it's just one girl.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.278
Girls are the only thing
I'm good at, Dad.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.812
I suck at everything else.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.363
Without that, I-I don't
even know who I am.

28:25.410 --> 28:26.571
You're my son.

28:26.620 --> 28:28.406
The loser.

28:28.450 --> 28:29.940
Said so yourself,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.820
Well, I was wrong.

28:31.870 --> 28:33.110
I didn't know you
when I said that,

28:33.170 --> 28:34.490
but I do now.

28:34.540 --> 28:37.453
And you're a good man
with a great heart.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.956
I wish I had something
to do with that,

28:39.000 --> 28:40.456
but I didn't.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.502
You figured that part out
all on your own.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.961
So...

28:47.010 --> 28:48.751
you made some mistakes.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.677
Yeah.
People make mistakes.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.516
You know how many
mistakes I've made?

28:53.560 --> 28:55.642
Too many to list.

28:57.570 --> 29:00.437
Could you try?

29:00.480 --> 29:04.439
Back in high school,
I plagiarized a term paper.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.527
<i>1 ran over )
my college dean's dog twice</i>

29:06.570 --> 29:07.981
on two separate occasions.

29:08.030 --> 29:10.863
On purpose?
No, and he was fine.

29:10.910 --> 29:14.210
I mean, he walked funny,
but he was a really happy dog.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.285
The point is...

29:18.340 --> 29:21.298
if this girl can't see
beyond your mistakes,

29:21.340 --> 29:25.049
see you for who you really are
in your heart,

29:25.090 --> 29:26.580
then you have to start
surrounding yourself

29:26.640 --> 29:30.599
with women who understand
that nobody's perfect.

29:30.640 --> 29:31.880
And if you find some,

29:31.930 --> 29:34.308
please introduce
one of them to me.

29:34.350 --> 29:35.385
I'm very lonely.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.726
) Freeman:
Given your test results,

29:39.770 --> 29:41.568
we're cleared
to start right away.

29:41.610 --> 29:44.489
Dr. Grant and I can discuss
the details of your protocol

29:44.530 --> 29:47.488
while you head out
to the waiting room.

29:47.530 --> 29:49.441
Oh. Can I stay?

29:49.490 --> 29:51.822
Well, it's just --
just a bunch of medical talk.

29:51.870 --> 29:54.157
Still, I've been
through this,

29:54.210 --> 29:56.030
and there were a lot of things
I wish I'd known.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.128
Stella, Sadie's 13.

29:58.170 --> 30:01.299
But in cancer years,
that's like 100.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.047
All right.

30:03.090 --> 30:06.048
You will be coming here
once a week for three months,

30:06.090 --> 30:08.969
followed by a month of
intensive in-patient treatment.

30:09.010 --> 30:11.172
How intensive?
Like, how bad could it get?

30:11.220 --> 30:13.803
Well, with any trial, there --
there can be some risks.

30:13.850 --> 30:17.013
She knows that.
She can hear the risks.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.892
There could be issues
with memory, pain,

30:18.940 --> 30:21.898
internal bleeding,
possible paralysis.

30:21.940 --> 30:23.681
These lists are
always scary.

30:23.730 --> 30:27.280
Doesn't mean any
of it's gonna happen.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.902
How many people
have you cured?

30:28.950 --> 30:30.941
We have not yet completed
a human trial.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.276
Wait, you haven't?

30:32.330 --> 30:33.616
But I'm optimistic
we can get as high

30:33.660 --> 30:35.446
as a 3% to 5%
success rate.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.117
That doesn't sound high.
Well, it is for a trial.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.537
Hey...I made it.

30:40.580 --> 30:42.628
So will you.

30:42.670 --> 30:44.252
But I might not?

30:44.300 --> 30:45.699
And I might get
paralyzed.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.041
Can I think about this?

30:50.090 --> 30:52.593
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.302
I saw a birthday cake
on the nurse's desk.

30:55.350 --> 30:57.808
I'm gonna grab a slice
before we go.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.147
This is why you don't
let a 13 year old

31:02.190 --> 31:04.318
sit in on
these conversations.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.317
Stella, we have pulled
SO many strings

31:06.360 --> 31:07.236
to get her in here.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.566
If she backs out now --

31:08.610 --> 31:10.317
Then we'll find her
something else.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.614
Giving her that information was
the right thing to do,

31:13.660 --> 31:17.904
though the two of you could work
on your delivery.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.611
Okay, now, I am also gonna
go get some cake.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.751
Hey, sweetie.

31:28.800 --> 31:29.585
Where's Daddy?

31:29.630 --> 31:32.383
He went to the hospital.

31:32.430 --> 31:34.387
Mom, will you
watch the kids?

31:34.430 --> 31:35.841
Woman: Sure, hon!

31:35.890 --> 31:37.722
Sweetie, Grandma's here.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.431
I'll be back.

31:43.770 --> 31:45.477
Hey.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.931
Careful.

31:46.980 --> 31:48.391
You almost stepped
through a shadow.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.818
That's funny.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.692
But, uh...the truth is,

31:52.740 --> 31:55.653
I'm not afraid
of the dark.

31:55.700 --> 32:00.319

the whole picture here.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.298
I would love to
tell you -- Pass.

32:10.340 --> 32:14.083
Sorry, but I'm not looking
to casually date a convict.

32:23.940 --> 32:26.432

32:26.480 --> 32:27.891
Yeah.

I'm surprised you can
still sit upright

after what just happened
to your butt.

32:32.070 --> 32:35.529
Yeah, it doesn't hurt
as bad as my hands.

Yeah, I know.

Don't sound so depressed.
Calluses are sexy.

I didn't come here
because I wanted to, either.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.466
it was helping me, too.

It's not that easy,
Stella.

That doesn't mean
you give up.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.035
You said you were hopeful.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.206

to be hopeful

when she was gonna
do the trial.

I thought you didn't want
to do the trial

33:49.360 --> 33:50.646

talking to Todd.

34:30.690 --> 34:33.819
I wanted to.

34:33.860 --> 34:36.022
But then I was thinking
about what you said.

the right thing.

not coming clean

could ruin yours.
