00:01.420 --> 00:03.290
Previously on Damages...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.650
Someone tried to kill me.

00:04.660 --> 00:07.020
And, uh, where is this body?

00:07.030 --> 00:08.360
I've been trying to reach patty.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.050
Go to the beach house.

00:10.060 --> 00:12.930
Patty, where the hell are you?

00:14.070 --> 00:15.690
Ellen wants to use your beach house.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.610
Be my guest.

00:16.620 --> 00:19.310
I am trying to settle this case.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.880
Try harder.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.770
Katie, katie, it's me.

00:22.780 --> 00:24.470
Start by looking into arlington.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.640
Arlington, Virginia.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.910
Some girl was killed in a car crash.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.050
It was frobisher's car.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.430
The girl's family went from living
in a trailer park to being the biggest
land owner in Arlington.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.250
I'm sorry, gregory, for everything.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.540
It's done.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.160
David.

01:21.170 --> 01:22.510
David.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.980
- David.
- Jesus!

01:27.520 --> 01:29.160
What's the matter, David?

01:30.430 --> 01:32.150
Where's Ellen?

01:33.190 --> 01:35.030
I'm right here.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.860
Ellen!

01:56.460 --> 01:57.630
Ellen.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.180
Hey. What's wrong?

02:04.980 --> 02:07.100
I could get used to this.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.950
What are you doing with her?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.480
What do you mean?

02:23.290 --> 02:25.270
Look, I like her.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.640
L-I... she's smart, capable, but...

02:30.870 --> 02:34.820
come on... she's not
your type of lawyer.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.080
How long you going to
keep her around?

02:40.190 --> 02:45.400
Ellen brought us Katie, Katie
brought us Gregory.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.120
Right.

02:47.440 --> 02:52.070
So as long as Gregory's
still in play, so is Ellen.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.580
Simple as that.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.000
Hey.

03:07.010 --> 03:09.950
- It's Katie.
- Oh, yeah?

03:12.450 --> 03:13.540
What's the matter?

03:13.550 --> 03:15.510
Gregory Malina's dead.

03:47.250 --> 03:53.250
Damages
Season 01 Episode 10

04:11.590 --> 04:13.470
Patty was at the beach house.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.200
What did you tell her?

04:15.210 --> 04:16.380
She was there.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.480
By the time I showed up,
she was gone.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.630
Looks like she left in a hurry.

04:22.170 --> 04:25.180
Look, ellen, I want to help you.

04:26.150 --> 04:28.320
I want to get you out of here.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.780
But I don't know what
to believe anymore.

04:30.790 --> 04:32.890
Someone tried to kill me, tom.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.230
It was a
hit-and-run.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.560
Gregory malina died at the scene.

04:39.090 --> 04:40.030
1 MONTH EARLIER

04:40.040 --> 04:41.830
So we move on...

04:42.720 --> 04:44.130
to frobisher's deposition.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.900
Here's the game plan
with one major addition.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.100
Ellen.

04:49.380 --> 04:55.200
Arlington, virginia,1983,frobisher's
jaguar crashes, killing the girl he's with.

04:55.210 --> 04:58.250
Frobisher denies he was driving, but
he was drunk at the time.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.830
He's never charged, so
there's no wrongful death suit

05:00.840 --> 05:04.180
but last week, we received a tip that

05:04.190 --> 05:09.040
frobisher gave the girl's
parents stock in his company.

05:09.050 --> 05:14.620
It's hush money, so we're going to use it to
show frobisher's history of obstructing justice.

05:15.020 --> 05:20.750
If we can crack his slick facade
in the deposition and get him to
show his true colors,

05:20.760 --> 05:22.870
it'll be a victory.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.060
Thanks, everyone.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.350
Thank you.

05:28.030 --> 05:29.060
Hey, there she is.

05:29.070 --> 05:30.300
Do you really have to go, dad?

05:30.310 --> 05:31.920
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

05:31.930 --> 05:34.080
Daddy's lawyer's helping him prepare.

05:34.090 --> 05:36.690
This way he can focus better, not
be distracted by all of us.

05:36.700 --> 05:40.470
Hey, Mohammed ali used to hole
up for six weeks before a fight.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.400
Who's that?

05:41.410 --> 05:44.620
Greatest fighter of all times after me.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.950
Oh, I'm not going to have
time to do that, sweetheart.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.630
Thought you could use this.

05:54.470 --> 05:56.160
Look at you.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.660
What's that for?

05:58.610 --> 06:01.730
The night before your
stepmom and I got married,

06:02.070 --> 06:05.530
I was staying in a hotel
room nervous as shit.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.400
Dad!

06:06.410 --> 06:07.990
You're old enough.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.290
Anyway, I was cooped up, sweating
bullets and holly sent me my three iron.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.660
Why?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.190
It's your dad's good luck charm.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.560
You're my good luck charm now.

06:26.780 --> 06:27.810
What are you doing?

06:27.820 --> 06:29.690
Come on, it's just another deposition.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.860
Everything's going to be okay.

06:32.630 --> 06:35.830
We're going to be fine, trust me.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.300
How ugly is this going to get?

06:40.370 --> 06:42.500
We're reasonable people.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.360
Yes, we are.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.720
No video camera.

06:46.730 --> 06:48.690
- Unreasonable.
- Patty...

06:48.700 --> 06:50.380
What are you worried about?

06:50.390 --> 06:52.110
Your client is a matinee idol.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.900
Unless his herpes has
flared up, he'll be just fine.

06:54.910 --> 06:55.860
Nonnegotiable.

06:55.870 --> 06:58.760
- I'll give you home- court
advantage. - Not interested.

06:58.770 --> 07:01.560
But since we're on the topic...

07:02.320 --> 07:03.730
how many sessions?

07:03.740 --> 07:05.840
- Seven.
- Two.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.250
Five.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.660
I have a lot of questions.

07:10.670 --> 07:12.840
That's what wikipedia is for.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.730
Okay, three.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.610
But I get the video camera.

07:24.850 --> 07:26.520
That's a big concession.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.310
So is three days.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.310
Deal.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.410
Gregory malina's dead.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.060
Oh, my.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.650
That's horrible.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.590
I guess we'll never know
what really happened.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.730
Maybe the police will find the guy.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.090
I won't hold my breath.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.840
And, uh, ray...

08:13.050 --> 08:15.290
shame on you.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.460
What's the matter with you, ray?
You look a little green.

08:30.860 --> 08:36.320
Listen, I got it down to three
days, but she's going to have a camera.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.780
That's okay, right?
We've prepared, I'm ready.

08:41.710 --> 08:45.150
Yeah, but, art, listen...

08:45.540 --> 08:46.930
What?

08:47.710 --> 08:50.910
You're going into this
deposition exposed.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.830
How so?

08:51.840 --> 08:55.480
Well, I don't know what to do about
this arlington business, I'm sorry.

08:55.960 --> 09:01.280
She's going to attack you with it and
there's no clear way i can see to stop her.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.320
I'm not settling, ray.

09:04.330 --> 09:07.720
Well, I don't know how to protect you.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.670
I'll just have to protect
myself then, won't I?

09:15.240 --> 09:17.470
How are you going to do that?

09:25.010 --> 09:27.200
You wanted to see me?

09:28.470 --> 09:30.530
How was the beach house?

09:30.850 --> 09:34.690
Amazing. I've been meaning to thank
you all day, but it's been so busy.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.110
David and I would love to
take you and phil to dinner.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.300
Oh, forget the dinner, ellen.

09:40.230 --> 09:44.600
I've decided to take
you off the deposition.

09:44.610 --> 09:47.230
I would like you to report to felicia.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.790
She needs some work done on
a pro bono she's heading up.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.900
Vacation's over.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.960
Get back to work.

09:57.380 --> 10:00.890
Yeah, I'll do that.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.200
What are you doing?

10:05.620 --> 10:08.730
Patty's making me do all
this paralegal bullshit.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.090
For the deposition?

10:10.100 --> 10:12.920
No, it has absolutely nothing
to do with the deposition.

10:14.070 --> 10:16.310
Then put that shit away, huh

10:19.370 --> 10:21.650
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:21.660 --> 10:26.860
In 1983,shortly after the tragedy
of their daughter, cindy's, death,

10:26.870 --> 10:31.280
I gave the lambert family
stock in my company.

10:31.290 --> 10:32.410
Holy shit.

10:32.420 --> 10:36.270
Now, there's some people who might think
that that act was a sign of guilt...

10:36.280 --> 10:42.350
or worse, an attempt to obfuscate a crime
and to buy the lambert family's silence.

10:43.470 --> 10:48.650
To respond to that, I'm going to turn
this part over to cindy's father, carl.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.010
Thank you, arthur.

10:50.810 --> 10:55.490
Uh, folks, for my wife and I, the
particulars of this tragedy were

10:55.500 --> 10:58.390
put to rest almost three decades ago.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.300
Now this is the police
report from the accident.

11:02.310 --> 11:07.880
It documents the angle of impact and the numerous
injuries sustained by both cindy and arthur.

11:07.890 --> 11:12.390
Now, this report
convinced us at that time,

11:12.800 --> 11:17.070
and we remain convinced, that our
daughter was driving that car.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.150
Unbelievable.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.000
Arthur frobisher provided financial support
to my family because he loved my daughter.

11:26.420 --> 11:30.060
The fact that it wasn't
made public is to his credit.

11:30.070 --> 11:31.940
Character is what you do in the dark.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.460
Isn't that what christ teaches us?

11:34.470 --> 11:36.940
- Oh, jesus.
- Thank you, carl.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.810
And thank all of you for coming today.

11:38.820 --> 11:44.920
Um, I just want to say I'm relieved and grateful
that this issue can finally be put to rest.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.640
1 MONTH LATER

11:50.650 --> 11:52.930
I don't know what to believe anymore.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.070
Someone tried to kill me, tom.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.300
Come on, ellen.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.520
When I left patty's
apartment, there was a dead body.

11:58.530 --> 12:01.520
There was blood on the
floor, a window had been broken.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.530
You've got to go there.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.540
You've got to go to patty's apartment.

12:04.550 --> 12:06.130
The police didn't find anything!

12:06.140 --> 12:08.770
Then someone's covering it up!

12:08.780 --> 12:11.720
Look, without any evidence, what can I do?

12:12.520 --> 12:14.280
Let's go, parsons.

12:14.290 --> 12:17.360
Get me bail. I'll do the rest myself.

12:37.010 --> 12:38.650
Patty?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.380
Okay, boy, okay.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.740
There's a good boy.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.800
Yeah, good boy.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.820
Patty?

12:53.950 --> 12:54.950
We were set up.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.980
Or there's a leak in the office.

12:56.990 --> 13:00.180
I don't want anyone in
the deposition but you, tom.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.550
We're going into lockdown.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.000
Miss hewes, I'd like to meet
with mr. Moore and question him.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.010
No.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.790
He could be the source of the leak.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.680
This thing was buried for 25 years.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.560
I said no.

13:20.710 --> 13:23.590
Call george moore, set up a meeting.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.480
What the hell was that press conference?

13:27.490 --> 13:29.780
It was art's idea. He did it on his own.

13:29.790 --> 13:31.850
And you let him? Your job
is to control your client.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.540
He won't listen to reason.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.600
This incompetence is staggering.

13:35.610 --> 13:39.120
Listen, asshole, this
arlington fiasco's on you.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.480
I warned you from the start
this was a jackass move,

13:41.490 --> 13:44.680
and now you've exposed
yourself to patty's people.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.260
Now just lay low and let me do my job.

13:47.270 --> 13:49.210
Clearly, you can'T.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.390
Maybe I'll tell him about
you and gregory malina.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.900
You don't want to do that.

13:53.910 --> 13:56.690
You gave that kid stock and
told him when to sell it.

13:56.700 --> 14:00.110
Arthur finds out the full
story, he'll have to settle.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.430
You better be careful.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.570
- I can take you down at any moment.
- Go ahead.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.930
You'll be taking yourself down as well.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.630
You can't touch me, ray. Arthur needs me.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.550
So do you.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.570
Which one do you think looks best?

14:20.650 --> 14:21.670
I like this.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.370
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.100
Use a windsor.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.770
It's assertive and formidable.

14:27.780 --> 14:30.260
You know, I never learned
how to tie that, actually.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.400
Can you believe that?

14:32.410 --> 14:35.230
Billionaire doesn't know
how to tie a rich man's knot?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.500
Here, sit down, I'll do it for you.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.860
- Holly usually helps me with this.
- Yeah?

14:57.810 --> 14:59.920
I want to thank you, ray.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.950
For my invaluable sartorial assistance?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.800
No, for everything.

15:10.150 --> 15:12.860
The last 16 years.

15:14.730 --> 15:18.090
Especially the last five. I
mean, I know it hasn't been easy.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.470
I know I can sometimes be kind of A...

15:25.140 --> 15:27.000
Bull in a china shop?

15:32.980 --> 15:35.980
This life is so full of people
trying to screw you, you know?

15:35.990 --> 15:39.660
You shake hands with them one day, the
next day they're trying to stab you.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.390
But you...

15:47.700 --> 15:50.780
you may be the only one I can trust, ray.

15:57.110 --> 15:59.510
You're a good friend.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.200
Hey, yeah.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.210
Let's go show 'em what we got.

16:21.420 --> 16:25.470
Spe stands for special purpose entity.

16:25.480 --> 16:29.900
I'd like to mark as exhibit
seven a chart entitled

16:29.910 --> 16:34.140
frobisher value analysis
dated march 4,2001.

16:34.150 --> 16:38.010
Do you recall seeing
this exhibit seven before?

16:38.300 --> 16:44.330
It's important to establish that it wasn't
me personally, that set up these entities.

16:45.090 --> 16:49.880
They were incorporated under the
direction of the Chief Operating Officer.

16:50.420 --> 16:56.320
So, despite running the company, you take
no responsibility for these entities that

16:56.330 --> 16:58.900
your COO created?

16:59.670 --> 17:02.260
In so far as I was his superior, yes,

17:02.270 --> 17:07.000
a certain amount of
responsibility must be inferred.

17:08.150 --> 17:10.800
But as far as direct
responsibility, no, no.

17:10.810 --> 17:14.640
I don't believe that I can be
held personally responsible.

17:15.750 --> 17:19.810
Mr. Frobisher, you were
intimately involved in

17:19.819 --> 17:23.690
founding your
company, running your company,

17:23.700 --> 17:25.470
bankrupting your company,

17:25.480 --> 17:28.140
and yet you sit here today
wanting us to believe that

17:28.150 --> 17:32.520
you have no idea where the money went.

17:32.530 --> 17:33.430
Objection.

17:33.440 --> 17:37.270
One more of those, counselor, and we're
going to have ourselves a problem.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.980
Look, all those SPEs and-and hold co's

17:42.990 --> 17:44.710
every company has them.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.580
I know when you see them up there
on a big chart with all those colors

17:47.590 --> 17:52.390
and arrows and unrestricted
this and offshore that, you...

17:53.330 --> 17:58.520
you think they've been designed
purposefully to confuse the 
heck out of you.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.290
And you know what?

18:00.300 --> 18:03.890
It works,'cause it
confuses the hell out of me,

18:03.900 --> 18:09.100
which is probably why I'm a
ceo and not a CFO or a COO.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.970
So,

18:12.430 --> 18:17.660
you don't consider it your duty
as chief executive of your company

18:18.190 --> 18:21.080
to understand its
financial underpinnings?

18:21.090 --> 18:26.030
A chief executive's job is
to set his company's agenda.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.450
You're like A... you're like a coach.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.140
Sometimes even a cheerleader.
You-you provide goals.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.820
You lead by example.

18:37.310 --> 18:44.080
I always believed that it was my duty
to inspire my employees so that...

18:44.860 --> 18:47.270
so that together we
could build something...

18:49.500 --> 18:51.270
remarkable.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.470
Hello

19:03.480 --> 19:06.680
Mr. Moore, it's Ellen Parsons.

19:07.160 --> 19:11.180
She spent the day lobbing
me softballs, loosening me up.

19:11.190 --> 19:13.140
It's going to get a lot tougher.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.620
But ray says the day went well.

19:16.630 --> 19:18.450
Good, I'm glad.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.860
Is there anything you need?

19:21.870 --> 19:25.190
Anything I can do to
make this easier for you?

19:25.200 --> 19:29.300
No, just talking to you helps.

19:29.310 --> 19:31.270
I love you, holly.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.340
I miss you guys.

19:37.060 --> 19:38.770
We miss you.

19:41.210 --> 19:44.070
- Night.
- Good night, arthur.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.630
He's going through so much.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.250
It's been hard for
you, too. Don't forget that.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.170
I'm so grateful i found you.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.870
I don't know how I would...

20:07.940 --> 20:09.780
Hey, we'll get through this.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.580
It'll be easier once you tell him.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.660
We have to wait until
after the deposition.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.390
Miss parsons.

20:42.330 --> 20:45.260
I put my ass on the line for you.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.720
Mr. Moore.

20:46.730 --> 20:51.110
I trusted you with arlington, and
your camp leaked it.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.580
Why would we do that?

20:54.740 --> 20:58.100
You don't understand how
frobisher operates, do you?

20:58.810 --> 21:03.100
Someone in your office is in his pocket.

21:03.870 --> 21:05.700
Or you are.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.270
Grow up.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.120
I could get killed for what i told you.

21:10.940 --> 21:16.300
You people had the opportunity to
take down frobisher, and you blew it.

21:16.830 --> 21:18.700
The case isn't over yet.

21:19.890 --> 21:21.820
Well, we are.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.560
You get nothing else from me.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.340
And tell tom shayes to stop calling.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.630
Mr. Moore?

21:37.430 --> 21:41.580
If there's a connection between you
and arthur frobisher, we will find it.

21:43.610 --> 21:45.570
Watch yourself.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.240
George moore is full of shit.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.500
He's saying we leaked arlington.

22:16.510 --> 22:18.240
What have you found?

22:18.250 --> 22:21.330
Moore was one of five sec
commissioners appointed.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.390
By who?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.670
The president.

22:23.680 --> 22:28.610
Moore headed up a team of investigators to
look into possible fraud in frobisher's company.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.990
Who's laura watkins?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.390
One of moore's investigators.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.900
But, in 2002,just before the
government trial, she was fired.

22:41.910 --> 22:44.130
Moore said her methods were unsound.

22:44.140 --> 22:47.120
After the trial, watkins
did this interview.

22:47.130 --> 22:51.230
She said that moore removed her
for investigating too aggressively.

22:51.240 --> 22:54.270
It was the first and last
interview she ever did.

22:54.910 --> 22:57.420
You think moore shut her down?

22:58.030 --> 23:01.020
Now she works for an accounting
firm here in the city.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.120
Have you told patty about this?

23:04.130 --> 23:05.240
No.

23:05.250 --> 23:09.310
And I'm not going to until I'm
absolutely sure I have something.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.350
George moore made a big show
of going after frobisher.

23:13.360 --> 23:15.260
- But you didn't believe he was?
- No.

23:15.270 --> 23:17.980
Behind the scenes, moore did nothing.

23:18.290 --> 23:22.220
He forced us to keep investigating
frobisher's stock broker

23:22.260 --> 23:26.070
months after it was clear
that it would be a dead end.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.550
Did you ever figure out moore's agenda?

23:28.560 --> 23:29.330
No.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.830
But, the weekend before
frobisher dumped his stock,

23:31.840 --> 23:35.160
we were getting ready to expose
the accounting fraud in his company.

23:35.170 --> 23:38.660
- The same weekend frobisher was in palm beach.
- Yeah. Exactly.

23:38.670 --> 23:41.430
And you know where george
moore was that same weekend?

23:41.440 --> 23:43.350
No. We had no reason to look into that.

23:43.360 --> 23:46.990
Well, he was in jacksonville, florida, less
than four hours away,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.320
at an sec commissioners' retreat.

23:49.330 --> 23:51.400
George moore chose
that location himself.

23:51.410 --> 23:54.920
He said he wanted to play
the 17th hole at sawgrass.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.430
Good morning.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.470
- Arthur frobisher.
- Yeah.

24:04.590 --> 24:06.100
I know who you are.

24:06.510 --> 24:07.520
Yeah.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.780
I probably shouldn't
be talking to you, huh?

24:11.830 --> 24:13.480
How's the coffee here?

24:15.580 --> 24:19.700
You know, when I was your age, i
used to run from moments like this,

24:20.130 --> 24:23.830
standing two feet from
somebody who hates your guts.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.030
Now I live for this shit.

24:28.340 --> 24:34.010
Was your trip to palm beach in june
2002 primarily business or pleasure?

24:34.020 --> 24:34.950
Business.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.270
I was there to deliver
a speech at a luncheon.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.750
That's where you met katie connor?

24:40.760 --> 24:42.740
No, we never met in florida.

24:42.750 --> 24:45.940
I was told later that she
was one of the caterers.

24:45.950 --> 24:49.780
And, afterwards, you approached
her about financing a restaurant?

24:50.070 --> 24:53.460
My attorney contacted
her on my behalf, yes.

24:53.470 --> 24:57.270
Why such interest in a novice chef?

24:57.280 --> 24:59.530
Objection. Vague.

25:00.430 --> 25:05.990
At the luncheon, an herb-encrusted
pork loin made quite an impression.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.080
I was told later that it
was ms. Connor's creation.

25:11.020 --> 25:17.600
Yet your financing of ms. Connor's restaurant halted
shortly after she agreed to testify in this case.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.010
Why was that?

25:20.580 --> 25:25.220
Ms. Connor went through a
series of personal struggles.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.450
Exhibit 41.

25:29.850 --> 25:32.970
Please mark as exhibit 41.

25:32.980 --> 25:35.650
Do you recognize this man?

25:36.860 --> 25:38.970
No, I don'T.

25:39.580 --> 25:44.900
Let the record reflect that exhibit
41 is a photograph of gregory malina.

25:46.820 --> 25:51.190
Were you aware that mr. Malina was in
palm beach the same weekend you were?

25:52.060 --> 25:54.300
No. I've never seen him before.

25:54.310 --> 25:57.850
So you didn't know he was
romantically linked to ms. Connor?

25:58.660 --> 26:00.000
No, I did not.

26:00.010 --> 26:03.380
Or that he owned a thousand
shares of stock in your company?

26:04.050 --> 26:07.420
My stock was publicly traded.
A lot of people had it.

26:07.430 --> 26:12.590
Or that in june,2002,he sold his stock
the very same morning you sold yours?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.950
No. No, I didn't know that.

26:20.410 --> 26:23.110
Are you aware mr. Malina is dead?

26:27.520 --> 26:29.040
No. No.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.000
But, like I said, I've
never seen this man before.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.130
I'm very sorry to hear that.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.260
I think that will be all for today.

27:01.690 --> 27:04.450
Did you give gregory
malina stock in my company?

27:04.460 --> 27:06.640
Absolutely not.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.790
Then who the hell tipped him off?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.690
I have no idea.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.390
It doesn't matter, art.
Malina can't hurt you.

27:16.740 --> 27:21.280
You know what i think? I think george
moore engineered this whole hit-and-run.

27:22.530 --> 27:26.050
Well, george is capable
of a lot of things.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.580
What does that mean? What do you mean?

27:30.780 --> 27:32.760
I think he leaked arlington.

27:32.770 --> 27:34.850
Well, for christ... Why would he do that?

27:34.860 --> 27:37.330
Save his own ass. Get you to settle.

27:38.870 --> 27:39.860
No, don'T...

27:39.870 --> 27:42.660
Senior partners wanted to meet with you.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.710
- We'll talk about this later.
- Oh, for...

27:45.720 --> 27:47.830
Hey, marshall, come on in.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.410
Amos, good to see you.

27:49.420 --> 27:52.510
Arthur, you remember marshall
phillips, amos denninger,

27:52.520 --> 27:55.970
my superiors in everything
but shortness and baldness.

27:56.790 --> 27:58.080
Come on in. Sit down.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.620
Amos, you look good.

27:59.770 --> 28:00.900
Thank you very much.

28:00.910 --> 28:05.680
Mr. Frobisher, we just want to assure you that every
one of our firm's resources is at your disposal.

28:05.690 --> 28:08.390
Well, marshall, i appreciate
that, but I'll tell you something.

28:08.400 --> 28:11.860
With ray, here, I never
felt more confident.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.610
Can I get you fellas a drink?

28:14.620 --> 28:16.460
No, nothing for me, thanks.

28:16.470 --> 28:19.160
Ray? I'm going to freshen
myself up here a little bit.

28:19.170 --> 28:20.860
I'm fine thank you

28:23.930 --> 28:27.790
********

28:29.140 --> 28:32.180
Ms. Hewes, I found a way to help.

28:32.190 --> 28:34.810
- I went back to george moore, and he...
- You did what?

28:35.300 --> 28:36.920
I spoke with george moore.

28:38.820 --> 28:40.600
Who told you to do that?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.680
It was my own initiative.
I thought we should follow...

28:42.690 --> 28:46.180
Thought? Who told you to think?

28:48.170 --> 28:51.180
You are in this office
to wait for instructions.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.800
You don't have license to think.

28:54.800 --> 29:00.880
You have jeopardized the only
serious lead we still have.

29:01.960 --> 29:05.350
How could you be so stupid?

29:10.200 --> 29:12.300
Just get out of my office.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.870
I'm so sick of your bullshit.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.340
What did you say to me?

29:35.160 --> 29:37.280
You heard me.

29:43.820 --> 29:45.450
Get out.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.280
And don't bother coming back.

30:09.290 --> 30:11.000
Give this to patty.

30:34.010 --> 30:35.890
What you looking for, boy? Hmm?

30:43.590 --> 30:45.240
You a good boy?

30:50.480 --> 30:51.670
Excuse me.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.910
Jeez...

30:54.510 --> 30:56.520
Does ms. Hewes know you're here?

30:56.920 --> 30:58.780
She gave me an extra set of keys.

31:01.530 --> 31:03.250
How did you get in?

31:03.970 --> 31:05.910
Service elevator.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.330
Ms. Hewes had a water delivery.

31:14.910 --> 31:17.420
Make sure you lock up when you go.

31:18.030 --> 31:19.500
Will do.

31:52.570 --> 31:53.650
Ellen?

31:56.490 --> 31:58.240
I was just fired.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.610
What happened?

31:59.620 --> 32:02.180
The thing is, I'm fine.

32:02.690 --> 32:05.150
Seriously, I feel great.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:07.850 --> 32:09.700
Let's go out.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.220
Let's get drunk.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.620
We still have some friends, don't we?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.920
- Hey, there he is.
- Art, come here.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.440
I tried to head you off.

32:20.150 --> 32:22.120
I've got some bad news.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.220
She's divorcing me.

32:30.230 --> 32:32.700
I am so sorry, art.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.380
Where did you get this?

32:37.390 --> 32:39.820
The papers were filed this morning.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.330
God...

32:48.060 --> 32:49.910
who else knows about this?

32:49.920 --> 32:52.990
Well, it's just us and the
court... it's not public yet.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.170
Look, l-I'm going to
reschedule today's session.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.580
No. No, no, no.

32:57.590 --> 32:59.170
I've prepared for this.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.730
Art... art, listen to me.

33:01.740 --> 33:07.610
You are distracted. I cannot have you in
that room in anything less than top form.

33:11.630 --> 33:13.480
I'm fine.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.170
Put this away.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.790
Come on.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.180
Mr. Frobisher, two days after you
returned from your trip to florida,

33:25.190 --> 33:28.470
you gave a speech to your employees.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.270
Yes, that's correct.

33:33.450 --> 33:35.180
Exhibit 67.

33:35.190 --> 33:38.510
It's a transcript of mr.
Frobisher's remarks dated...

33:38.520 --> 33:42.680
june 21,2002.

33:43.030 --> 33:47.440
Were you aware that your company was
being investigated by the sec at the time?

33:47.450 --> 33:49.280
Yes, I was.

33:49.880 --> 33:55.070
And yet you still told your employees that
the company was on sound financial ground?

33:55.080 --> 33:57.220
I was confident that we were.

33:57.230 --> 34:00.980
I firmly believed that the
sec investigation would turn up

34:00.990 --> 34:04.630
no financial irregularities whatsoever.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.280
Exhibit 68.

34:06.290 --> 34:10.730
This is an e-mail you sent
your cfo, is that correct?

34:11.989 --> 34:13.040
Yes, it is.

34:13.050 --> 34:18.400
It's a rough draft of the speech you wrote, the
one you intended to give your employees?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.510
Yes, it appears to be that.

34:21.520 --> 34:27.090
In the margin, you wrote the words, too
rosy, followed by a question mark.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.530
Too rosy.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.650
I think I was...

34:32.909 --> 34:35.389
wondering about the tone of the speech.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.429
I was debating whether or
not to acknowledge the...

34:38.870 --> 34:41.659
the climate that we were in at the time.

34:41.670 --> 34:46.739
By climate, you mean the sec was
about to expose your accounting fraud.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.870
Objection.

34:49.530 --> 34:54.230
For me to ignore the pending sec report
would have threatened my credibility,

34:54.239 --> 34:59.800
so in my final speech, I decided to
mention the investigation and even A...

35:00.450 --> 35:03.960
possible action against us by the sec.

35:03.970 --> 35:05.060
But...

35:05.070 --> 35:10.320
- you also continued to insist that your
company was financially sound?
- Yes.

35:10.330 --> 35:12.060
And your employees trusted you?

35:12.070 --> 35:13.870
Absolutely.

35:13.880 --> 35:18.620
For almost 35 years, they knew
that I was fully committed to them.

35:19.150 --> 35:22.770
There's nothing more important
to the well-being of a company

35:22.780 --> 35:27.560
than the relationshipbetween
its workers and its management.

35:32.370 --> 35:33.920
Well, that'S...

35:33.930 --> 35:36.320
sort of like a family, isn't it?

35:36.330 --> 35:39.060
Yes, it's very much like a family.

35:40.070 --> 35:43.010
And you were the head of the household?

35:43.330 --> 35:47.920
You might say you were both husband
and father to your employees.

35:47.930 --> 35:49.750
Objection.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.780
You could say that, yes.

35:58.060 --> 36:01.420
And was it your job to
hold the family together?

36:05.160 --> 36:06.820
Yes, it was.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.030
- And you failed.
- Objection.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.570
I'll rephrase.

36:12.990 --> 36:15.210
I mean... was it...

36:15.720 --> 36:18.710
- very painful for you when you failed?
- Objection.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.500
- I'm warning you, counselor.
- I'm merely asking mr. Frobisher

36:21.510 --> 36:23.840
about his commitment to his company.

36:23.850 --> 36:28.420
Would you agree that the crumbling
of that relationship is nothing less,

36:28.430 --> 36:31.590
really, than the
dissolution of a marriage?

36:33.520 --> 36:35.810
You watch what you say.

36:36.950 --> 36:38.850
Your position...

36:38.860 --> 36:43.550
is that the collapse of your company
wasn't your fault, is that right?

36:43.560 --> 36:45.630
Yes, that's correct.

36:46.260 --> 36:49.030
I was misled by the accountants.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.380
Um, I take full responsibility
but not the blame.

36:52.390 --> 36:54.920
Well, I understand...
it's like marriages.

36:54.930 --> 36:57.510
Companies just fail sometime.

36:57.520 --> 36:59.240
Irreconcilable differences.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.640
No one is to blame.
Is that your position?

37:01.650 --> 37:03.720
One more like that, and we will walk out.

37:03.730 --> 37:07.130
Is that your position, mr. Frobisher?

37:07.140 --> 37:11.700
- Or is the failure of this relationship,
as you call it, your failure?
- Patty...

37:11.710 --> 37:13.880
- patty, I'm warning you.
- Your breach of trust,

37:13.890 --> 37:15.120
- your infidelity...
- You are out of line...

37:15.130 --> 37:16.810
Goddamn it!

37:17.870 --> 37:20.020
This is bullshit!

37:20.030 --> 37:21.750
- This is bullshit!
- Art...

37:21.760 --> 37:23.660
I'm done here. This is bullshit.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.830
This is absolute
bullshit, and you know it.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.300
No, I'm done. Uh-uh.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.730
- No, I'm done.
- Arthur...

37:28.740 --> 37:31.090
I'll see you in court, you bitch.

37:46.550 --> 37:49.690
Are you kidding me? Divorce?

37:49.700 --> 37:51.560
You blindsided me,
you know that, Holly?

37:51.570 --> 37:52.920
We'll talk about this later, Arthur.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.810
Did you want patty hewes
to use this against me?

37:55.820 --> 37:56.880
- Of course not.
- Is that what you wanted?

37:56.890 --> 37:58.210
- Of course not.
- Then why now?

37:58.220 --> 37:59.180
Why now, holly?

37:59.190 --> 38:01.680
- Arthur, this isn't about the case,
it's about us.
- Bullshit! No, bullshit!

38:01.690 --> 38:02.910
You screwed me!

38:02.920 --> 38:04.690
You screwed yourself, too,
you know that?

38:04.700 --> 38:07.830
This is our money. We're
talking about our money here.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.940
- I'm sorry, arthur.
- Look at this.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.890
- I gave you everything you ever wanted!
- Stay away from me.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.160
Stay away from me.

38:13.170 --> 38:15.150
I could've ended this
anytime I wanted, you know.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.710
I could've made this go away months ago.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.710
- Hey, what are you do... Come on.
- Move the car.

38:23.130 --> 38:25.600
Did you even think about the
kids? You ever think about that?

38:25.610 --> 38:28.540
You move that car, I will kill you.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.850
Open the window; let's talk. Come on.

38:31.860 --> 38:34.410
Holly, come on, open the window...

38:34.770 --> 38:36.130
Open the...

38:40.400 --> 38:45.130
holly, talk to me, will ya?

38:45.140 --> 38:46.720
Stop the car!

38:46.730 --> 38:48.570
Stop the damn car!

39:09.780 --> 39:12.900
Hey, ray. The hell with this.

39:13.750 --> 39:17.440
I can't take any more of
it. Just make an offer.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.650
How's my favorite divorce attorney?

39:24.660 --> 39:26.970
Men and women still hate
each other, so I'm good.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.490
Oh, boy, thanks for the tip.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.670
I hope it didn't get you
in trouble with your client.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.220
I just blamed it on
the clerks at the court.

39:39.730 --> 39:41.970
High-profile divorce like this...

39:41.980 --> 39:44.850
Yeah, they would have leaked
it to the press anyway.

39:46.750 --> 39:50.150
Besides, this thing's going
to be about custody...

39:50.160 --> 39:52.080
and infidelity.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.200
I owe you one.

39:57.300 --> 39:59.120
Where they serve tequila.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.060
Very nice.

40:01.070 --> 40:02.750
Ellen, where are you
going to work now?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.430
I don't know. I have
no idea! I don't care.

40:05.440 --> 40:06.940
Do you know where I can
work? Where can I work?

40:06.950 --> 40:09.730
New york city subway. The
new york city subway station.

40:15.430 --> 40:17.010
You could a sushi photographer.

40:25.070 --> 40:26.370
Raymond.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.740
- 500
- 500?

40:30.200 --> 40:32.030
You heard me, patty.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.710
I daresay, it's as much
as you could've hoped for.

40:37.430 --> 40:38.990
More than fair.

40:39.860 --> 40:41.550
Let's wrap this up.

40:46.090 --> 40:47.370
Patty?

40:48.690 --> 40:51.090
Oh, it's tempting, ray.

40:52.390 --> 40:54.510
I could use a vacation.

40:55.300 --> 40:57.010
You deserve one.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.090
But I've still got work to do.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.840
- Patty...
- No deal.

41:04.610 --> 41:08.690
If gregory malina was worth
killing, he must have known something.

41:08.700 --> 41:13.160
If he testified, my guess, we'd
be talking ten figures.

41:17.110 --> 41:19.910
Not so chatty now, are you, ray?

41:21.860 --> 41:25.310
You won't get more than
500 out of my client, patty.

41:27.150 --> 41:28.670
Evening, ray.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.860
It didn't matter, grades were in, and
she goes, what would I do in that case?

41:48.870 --> 41:50.660
Oh, I'll tell you what I would do, calder,

41:50.670 --> 41:53.530
I'd... shh, shh, let me tell it...
I'll tell you what I would do.

41:53.540 --> 41:55.340
I'd 'sub-penis' him.

41:56.860 --> 41:57.900
She said sub-penis!

41:57.910 --> 41:59.750
She said penis in law school.

41:59.760 --> 42:04.310
- And he was, like, who do you think
you are, Ms. Parsons?
- Calder with his silver streak, right? Calder?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.880
I didn't know what I was
saying. He was so sleazy.

42:06.890 --> 42:08.440
He kept asking me out on dates.

42:08.450 --> 42:10.550
Who the hell is this
guy? Where is that guy?

42:19.580 --> 42:20.260
Who is it?

42:20.270 --> 42:21.470
Oh, it's my mom.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.390
He wanted to take you to
a drive-in of viva zapata.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.520
This is ellen parsons.

42:26.530 --> 42:32.100
You can leave a message here or
reach me at my office: 212-752-4708.

42:33.030 --> 42:35.890
This is some pretty
interesting stuff you found.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.870
I don't even want a goddamn centerpiece.

42:43.200 --> 42:43.840
Oh, my god!

42:43.850 --> 42:45.270
Sorry, I didn't realize
it was the honeymoon.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.800
I'm sorry. I hate that shit.

42:51.930 --> 42:53.500
You were right.

42:55.070 --> 42:58.460
Whoever tried to clean up
the body missed something.

42:58.470 --> 42:59.640
What?

42:59.650 --> 43:02.030
Blood. I saw... the blood.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.200
Look, l-I got to take
this to the police.

43:04.210 --> 43:05.820
Did you get any word from patty?

43:05.830 --> 43:07.380
I've left messages.

43:07.390 --> 43:09.090
I've told her that she's
got to come back here.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.850
She doesn't want to come back.

43:10.860 --> 43:12.390
Why not?

43:18.230 --> 43:19.660
Ellen...

43:20.560 --> 43:24.930
patty is a lot of things, but
she's not a murderer.

43:26.650 --> 43:29.040
I know things, Tom.

43:29.890 --> 43:32.110
Things that could destroy her.

43:34.040 --> 43:38.000
You think patty tried to
kill you to protect herself?

43:39.020 --> 43:42.790
Well, the only way that I'm going
to find out is if I talk to her.

43:46.370 --> 43:48.020
Face-to-face.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.120
So call her.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.720
Tell her I know she wants me dead.
