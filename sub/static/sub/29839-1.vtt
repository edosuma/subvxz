Here, just sit, okay?

03:10.774 --> 03:13.318
You think you can get
Argus to come over here.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.903
He doesn't listen to me.

03:14.943 --> 03:16.820
He was never my bird.

03:16.862 --> 03:18.073
Not that one.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.533
Latched right on to your
mother as a hatchling.

03:21.992 --> 03:23.495
Kindred spirits those two.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.289
Stubborn and stubboner.

03:27.748 --> 03:31.002
We still joke about who
you take after, her or him.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.171
I'm worried that
he's not eating enough.

03:34.588 --> 03:36.883
A thousand eyes but unable
to see what's good for him.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.551
He'll give in
when he's hungry.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.848
Well, since I know you's here,

03:46.141 --> 03:48.394
I will go wish my
bride a blessed day.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.625
I thought I
saw my mom this morning.

04:13.919 --> 04:17.423
I was coming in from
feeding my peacock Argus

04:17.464 --> 04:19.132
and I coulda sworn I
saw her watching me

04:19.175 --> 04:20.384
from the kitchen window.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.053
Go on.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.225
When did this come about?

04:27.266 --> 04:29.226
This all happened so
fast I barely had any time

04:29.269 --> 04:30.728
to think at all.

04:30.769 --> 04:32.980
What is
there to think about?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.108
Your father was
diagnosed years ago

04:35.149 --> 04:36.942
and we've spent
countless clinical hours

04:36.985 --> 04:38.110
exploring your
thoughts and feelings

04:38.153 --> 04:38.944
about his illness.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.821
I know.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.782
But this made it real.

04:43.824 --> 04:45.117
It has always been real.

04:48.954 --> 04:50.914
I thought I saw
my mom this morning.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.423
I was coming in from
feeding my peacock Argus

04:58.464 --> 05:00.049
and I coulda sworn I
saw her watching me

05:00.091 --> 05:01.175
from my bedroom window.

05:06.430 --> 05:08.849
I don't want it to start
all over again, Farmer.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.642
The fantasy that
she's still here,

05:10.685 --> 05:12.103
I thought I was done with that.

05:13.771 --> 05:14.646
You are
very good at the work

05:14.689 --> 05:16.691
that we do here, Elizabeth.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.776
I better be.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.319
We've been at it long enough.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.326
Go on.

06:45.612 --> 06:47.949
It always
interests me how we go on

06:49.074 --> 06:50.534
but we do.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.579
We fucking persist.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.165
We assign meaning
to empty things.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.834
We find hobbies to distract us

06:57.875 --> 06:59.543
for a few minutes
here and there.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.757
Who are we kidding?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.432
Fuck.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.697
Yeah?

08:53.950 --> 08:56.494
That noise, you can
imagine how disruptive it is

08:56.535 --> 08:57.369
to my work.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.541
I can.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.001
Can you imagine how disruptive
it would be to my work

09:04.043 --> 09:05.044
if I stopped?

09:09.381 --> 09:10.632
I'll be done by 4:00.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.971
Work with me here, sir.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.557
I don't know the first
thing about demolition.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.561
What, no, no, just
let me do my job.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.436
Mint?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.315
Do I need one?

09:25.356 --> 09:26.190
Yes.

09:31.111 --> 09:31.945
Russell Hank.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.428
- Ah.
- Hi.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.472
Sorry to call you out
of the blue like this.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.473
Murray told me to
try Mrs. Kraftt first

09:59.515 --> 10:01.600
but there was no answer.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.436
There wouldn't be.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.396
Sorry, I didn't know he even
had an appointment today.

10:05.437 --> 10:06.898
I had a cancellation.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.276
I'm only in this area twice a
year so Murray made it work.

10:10.317 --> 10:11.903
Spent most of my career
at Johns Hopkins.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.823
Now I make the rounds of
these small rural hospitals.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.282
That's really great.

10:16.323 --> 10:18.534
So what's your
opinion of my dad?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.414
Well, we're just
finishing up his MRI

10:23.456 --> 10:25.582
and there are some
decisions to be made.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.376
What kind of decisions?

10:27.418 --> 10:29.420
I know, who am I, right?

10:29.461 --> 10:30.672
New doctor walks in,

10:30.714 --> 10:32.340
right away he wants to
change the wallpaper.

10:32.381 --> 10:35.217
But I have to tell you,
Elizabeth, the wallpaper is ugly.

10:35.259 --> 10:38.388
Your father's Parkinson's
is not getting any better.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.930
And during this
afternoon's tests

10:39.972 --> 10:42.766
I observed some secondary
symptoms that trouble me.

10:42.808 --> 10:46.062
Time to start thinking about
deep brain stimulation.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.439
- It is good?
- It, oh.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.234
Good.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.278
It's a somewhat routine surgery
for Parkinson's sufferers.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.948
We just drill a small
hole in Murray's cranium,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.490
implant a couple of electrodes,

10:58.533 --> 11:00.576
check to see that his motor
functions are improved

11:00.618 --> 11:02.162
and then close him right up.

11:03.495 --> 11:04.956
Worst part'll be the haircut.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.583
Fuck.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.252
Sorry, I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.586
Don't apologize, Elizabeth.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.129
It's one of my favorite words.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.048
Housekeeping to...

11:13.089 --> 11:15.258
Everyone calls me Bess.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.800
All right, Bess.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.054
Sure you wanna go home

11:19.095 --> 11:20.638
and discuss this
with your family.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.140
But what
does my dad think?

11:23.182 --> 11:24.350
He
won't do anything

11:24.392 --> 11:25.685
without your and Mrs.
Kraftt's approval.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.314
There is
no Mrs. Kraftt.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.523
Excuse me?

11:30.565 --> 11:33.234
I, my mother passed
away 10 years ago.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.829
I wish I could stay
and eat with you

11:45.871 --> 11:49.333
but my Ocular Anatomy and
Physiology class starts tonight.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.794
Ooh, sounds boring as hell.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.879
I know.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.506
Then why are you going?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.551
It'll be good to have
a marketable skill.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.928
Careful, turn the
heat down a bit.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.727
I told
you I'm not eating.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.229
But your mother is.

12:09.269 --> 12:12.023
This is exactly what Dr.
Klienart was talking about.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.191
You're sick.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.692
I'm well aware of that.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.485
In the head, Dad, dementia.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.405
One of the many
joys of Parkinson's.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.157
And the fact that
you refuse to accept

12:21.198 --> 12:23.075
that Mom is gone is proof.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.995
She's dead, Dad, gone, dead.

12:26.037 --> 12:30.208
I've told you many times she's
right here, alive and well.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.668
Yoo hoo, over here.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.884
Look, I'm shaking
more than you.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.887
But it's the right thing.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.891
Afterwards everything will
be different and better.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.560
Dr. Klienart is sure of it.

12:49.601 --> 12:52.396
Yeah, well, when a guy
wants to go poking around

12:52.438 --> 12:55.357
inside your head, you
better do one hell of a job

12:55.399 --> 12:56.985
selling the advantages.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.403
Why don't you put
it off awhile, Murray?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.278
You have time.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.365
Let's stop being so gloomy.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.033
I'll be fine, right?

13:04.075 --> 13:05.118
Better than ever.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.952
And if not,
everything has an end.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.330
Only the sausage has two.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.001
Great.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.210
Oh boy.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.130
I'll be upstairs.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.480
Where are your coveralls?

13:35.565 --> 13:36.775
Please put them back on.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.151
Please?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.695
What's
your problem, man?

13:42.822 --> 13:43.822
I'm on the spectrum

13:45.158 --> 13:46.993
and I was raised
Pennsylvania Dutch.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.206
I, too, am a connoisseur
of beef burgers.

13:51.246 --> 13:53.540
I highly value their
uniform size and quality.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.712
Never thought of it like that.

14:00.255 --> 14:02.424
I just saw it as another
way to kill myself.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.970
Are you suicidal?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.182
I damn sure hope so.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.187
Whatever you don't finish
I would like to have.

14:26.573 --> 14:27.574
My mother always gave me

14:27.616 --> 14:28.951
the same advice.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.913
She'd say, "Russell,
stop being so difficult.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.250
"You're only gonna
end up lonely."

14:35.291 --> 14:36.710
And she was also

14:36.750 --> 14:38.377
the most difficult, lonely
person who ever lived.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.049
Biology is destiny.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.444
I was being accommodating.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.528
You were flirting.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.240
I'm sorry I'm late.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.868
Oh that's okay.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.370
Noonan, exam room C.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.331
I refuse to put up
with that sauce box.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.833
Isn't it
wonderful, Bess?

15:17.875 --> 15:20.086
Some day all this will be yours.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.548
It is wonderful.

15:29.636 --> 15:31.055
Dr. Smithson.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.141
Doctoral
Candidate Smithson you mean.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.145
Jesus, Farmer, what's
with all the noise?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.689
What can I do
for you, Dr. Shine?

15:40.731 --> 15:41.899
I'm
calling to invite you

15:41.941 --> 15:43.442
to the Templeton
reception tomorrow.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.903
I cannot participate.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.154
Come on, Farmer,
I'm trying to help you.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.330
You could mix and
mingle, network.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.087
Just make an hour of
nice with the schmucks

16:03.129 --> 16:04.172
who pay your rent.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.423
I believe in you.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.343
I wouldn't be your
advisor if I didn't.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.514
I'll consider it.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.312
Put yolk in your hair, dear.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.940
Bess, pull over.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.275
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.947
This may sound odd, but
I'd like to do this alone.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.281
What, what do you mean?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.412
This disease doesn't make
me feel like much of a man

18:40.452 --> 18:41.453
most of the time.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.667
But it feels very manly to
walk into brain surgery alone,

18:45.709 --> 18:47.335
very John Wayne.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.168
Stop it.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.253
I wanna go with you.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.212
No, you don't.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.426
You and your mother
as so much alike.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.970
Were, Dad, were.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.432
I'm going to be awake
for this whole thing

19:01.473 --> 19:04.601
and it will be over
before we know it.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.769
So let's treat today

19:05.811 --> 19:07.229
like it's any other

19:07.271 --> 19:10.567
and when I come out of
surgery and I'm good as new,

19:11.692 --> 19:13.778
we'll come back
here and celebrate.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.987
Can you do that for me?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.699
Can you do that for me?

19:21.493 --> 19:22.745
Happy Birthday, Bessie.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.831
I completely forgot.

19:30.545 --> 19:35.550
Thank you, Papa.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.696
So you've been
attempting to kill yourself

19:56.738 --> 20:00.033
for the past four years
and have yet to succeed.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.911
Well, the goal
isn't death exactly.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.287
Evidence suggests.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.208
I just can't
seem to figure out

20:08.249 --> 20:10.335
a better way to disappear.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.378
What do you mean "disappear"?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.254
I don't know.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.883
I just always had this feeling

20:18.050 --> 20:20.052
like I was supposed
to be invisible

20:20.095 --> 20:23.097
but somehow I
ended up like this.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.225
Interesting.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.478
$40 a session and you will be

20:28.519 --> 20:31.314
invisible by summer.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.566
Are you a doctor?

20:33.607 --> 20:34.858
Not yet.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.237
Technically, you'd be
a research subject.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.615
No way am I
sharing my feelings with you.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.367
Nor I with you.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.579
Empathy is a daily
struggle for me.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.331
Order and logic
are my methodology.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.584
Are evenings good for you?

20:52.460 --> 20:53.252
Are you deaf?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.461
Said I'm not interested.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.222
I'm not deaf.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.903
I wanted to give you
this before I left.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.571
It's for the rest
of the semester.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.449
Thank you so much.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.116
Are you liking your class?

21:25.076 --> 21:26.995
Are you learning anything?

21:27.037 --> 21:29.204
Well, it turns out I
don't know the first thing

21:29.247 --> 21:30.664
about ocular anatomy.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.626
Well, if you
ever have any questions,

21:34.501 --> 21:35.794
you know where to find me.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.853
Mrs. Kraftt?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.816
Is he still unconscious?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.442
Yes,
but I want you to know

22:39.483 --> 22:42.319
I couldn't be more optimistic
about Murray's recovery.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.990
His vital signs are good,
all of the lab results

22:46.031 --> 22:49.201
and brain scans indicate
he's in excellent health.

22:51.121 --> 22:54.416
Can you really go blind
by staring at the sun?

22:54.457 --> 22:58.545
Well, the
retina is a delicate thing.

22:58.586 --> 23:02.048
I have to admit, meeting
you has me confused.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.173
Your daughter told me...

23:03.215 --> 23:04.675
That I'm dead?

23:04.718 --> 23:05.552
I know.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.013
It's been a million
theories over the years

23:09.055 --> 23:10.557
but nothing sticks.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.558
And everyone in town has
pussyfooted around her

23:12.599 --> 23:14.394
for half a lifetime.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.853
She's been here.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.148
We discussed Mr. Kraftt's
operation at length.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.900
She can see her
father just fine.

23:22.861 --> 23:23.903
I'm the only invisible person

23:23.944 --> 23:26.071
in her life.

23:26.114 --> 23:29.034
We live in the same house, we
eat at the same dinner table,

23:29.075 --> 23:30.492
we park in the same garage

23:32.077 --> 23:35.373
but she can't see me or
hear me or even sense me.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.625
I simply don't exist.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.086
Well, I have never come
across anything like it

23:41.128 --> 23:42.921
in all my studies of the brain.

23:43.798 --> 23:45.215
Why, she should see someone.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.387
I'm, I mean, a specialist.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.641
Has she had her vision charted?

23:53.682 --> 23:55.769
- A brain scan?
- We've tried everything,

23:56.769 --> 23:59.105
gone everywhere,
done everything.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.899
She has been seeing
someone in town

24:01.941 --> 24:04.152
who's taken her on as
like a special project.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.030
She seems to have stabilized.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.451
At this point a cure just
seems out of the question.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.305
Will you shift a little?

24:32.346 --> 24:33.722
You're pressing on my ribs.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.057
That's birth trauma.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.767
Breathe through it.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.269
I'm really sweating.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.853
That's amniotic fluid.

24:39.895 --> 24:40.896
It's to be expected.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.774
Now you're doing very good

24:43.817 --> 24:47.153
and you've spent
the last nine months

24:47.194 --> 24:49.239
preparing for life.

24:49.279 --> 24:53.242
So when you're ready,
start to push your way

24:53.284 --> 24:54.285
into the world.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.580
Focus.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.290
- Head stayed up and breathe.
- I'm dying under here.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.585
Oh, what's wrong?

25:02.626 --> 25:04.421
I cannot have a
wrongful death lawsuit.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.088
It would greatly
jeopardize my research.

25:06.131 --> 25:07.507
No, no, I'm not really dying.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.634
It's just an expression.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.343
Here, come back here.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.512
I'll be born again
better this time.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.140
Not tonight, Elizabeth.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.142
Rebirthing takes
too much out of me.

25:17.182 --> 25:20.603
Please, Farmer, I'll do
anything to get better.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.500
This thought keeps going

25:42.541 --> 25:43.667
around my head lately

25:43.710 --> 25:45.711
that maybe I'm already dead

25:45.753 --> 25:48.298
and that this is some
delusion of existence.

25:49.758 --> 25:50.633
Heavy, right?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.512
Good God,
I'm full of shit.

you about a girl

26:28.253 --> 26:29.963
and her tree house in the sky.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.053
If I told you that that girl
believes her mother is dead

26:35.095 --> 26:36.721
simply because
she can't see her.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.434

26:42.477 --> 26:45.063

26:48.273 --> 26:50.359
A smile for everyone

27:21.891 --> 27:24.394

27:34.487 --> 27:35.822
Look at that patty.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.159
Perfectly round, perfectly flat.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.044
Burgers were my
mom's signature dish.

27:52.756 --> 27:53.590
They were awful.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.009
The only time she fixed them

27:57.051 --> 27:58.469
was when one of her
boyfriends was over

27:58.510 --> 28:02.097
and she was too caught up to
pay any attention to the grill.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.807
I, too, have childhood
memories of beef.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.185
It was my job to milk
the cows each morning.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.480
You grew up on a farm?

28:10.397 --> 28:11.231
I did.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.027
Had I stayed, my
condition would've made me

28:14.068 --> 28:15.110
an excellent farmer.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.491
People think you need
an affinity for plants.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.826
But success simply relies
on accurate calculations,

28:22.868 --> 28:26.497
soil composition, weather,
acreage, et cetera.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.539
Why did you leave?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.751
My parents died
when I was six.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.131
That's when I moved here.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.050
At what part of town?

28:39.719 --> 28:40.886
I just told you, here.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.894
Bitch of a commute.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.105
Not at all.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.063
I simply walk up.

28:52.565 --> 28:53.400
I was joking.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.194
And what
are you doing here?

28:57.237 --> 28:58.238
It's a long story.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.405
I've been all over.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.491
But there's a lotta work
for a demolition guy

29:02.534 --> 29:03.993
in these parts.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.662
And do you enjoy your work?

29:06.913 --> 29:07.747
Sure.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.542
I get to take something solid

29:10.583 --> 29:12.252
and make it like
it never existed.

29:13.545 --> 29:14.629
A magician of sorts.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.589
It's hardly magic.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.261
And your
family, where are they?

29:29.102 --> 29:30.394
Who's Elizabeth K?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.272
Your therapy partner.

29:34.857 --> 29:38.028
Okay, I told you
I'm not doing therapy.

29:39.237 --> 29:40.947
I have yet to tell
you to do anything.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.824
Group therapy is one of the
last courses of treatment

29:43.866 --> 29:45.242
I have yet to try with Elizabeth

29:45.285 --> 29:46.494
and I believe the two of you

29:46.536 --> 29:49.080
- will pair off nicely.
- No, no, you see,

29:49.122 --> 29:50.749
you don't understand.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.209
I wouldn't be good for
anyone's mental health.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.211
Please never again
make an assumption

29:56.253 --> 29:57.338
about my understanding.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.256
I'm offering my help.

29:58.298 --> 29:59.758
I'm not a charity case.

30:00.967 --> 30:01.801
Correct, you are
a medical case.

30:03.761 --> 30:05.262
Look, I know you
hate it when I show up

30:05.305 --> 30:07.097
without an appointment but I
really need to talk to you.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.266
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.475
No, no, wait.

30:10.393 --> 30:11.603
Wait please.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.104
Before we continue,

30:13.145 --> 30:15.856
I would like to
introduce you to Russell.

30:15.898 --> 30:16.899
Who's that?

30:17.817 --> 30:18.984
Well, ask him yourself.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.863
Okay, when will he be here?

30:23.073 --> 30:24.115
It's not another one of
your research assistants

30:24.156 --> 30:25.616
is it, Farmer?

30:25.657 --> 30:28.118
I can't sit for another one
of those practice intakes.

30:28.161 --> 30:29.662
Hi, hello.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.998
Russell is your
group therapy partner.

30:32.039 --> 30:32.915
Stop being rude.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.042
Say hello.

30:34.084 --> 30:35.460
- Wait, I told you
- Really?

30:35.501 --> 30:37.044
- I'm not doing group therapy.
- Wait, group therapy?

30:37.086 --> 30:38.296
Are you guys fucking with me?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.463
Not at all, Russell.

30:39.506 --> 30:41.048
Who are you talking to?

30:42.424 --> 30:43.884
Can she not see me?

30:49.015 --> 30:51.976
Can you not see him?

30:52.018 --> 30:53.228
Are you mocking my dad?

30:54.813 --> 30:56.314
The most important person to me

30:56.355 --> 30:58.316
is the sickest he's ever
been and you're making fun

30:58.357 --> 31:00.317
of the fact he sees
people who aren't there?

31:00.359 --> 31:03.737
I was speaking
directly to Russell Hank,

31:03.779 --> 31:06.700
the tall young man that is
standing right across from you.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.536
You know what?

31:10.577 --> 31:11.620
I should really be
at the hospital.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.216
I dare say, Russell,

31:24.299 --> 31:26.510
this is a highly
significant development.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.721
Holy shit.

31:30.765 --> 31:31.599
You're a genius.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.729

32:34.412 --> 32:35.622
what I'm supposed to do

32:35.663 --> 32:36.955
with the fact that I
want to look at her

32:36.998 --> 32:40.125
and look at her and
maybe never stop?

32:41.001 --> 32:41.877
Cheers.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.087
Happy Birthday.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.130
Happy Birthday to you.

33:08.570 --> 33:10.698
Consider the
condition of selective hearing

33:10.740 --> 33:12.616
most children suffer from.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.285
One tells a child
to do his homework

33:14.326 --> 33:16.453
and he tunes you out completely.

33:16.496 --> 33:21.501
This is selective perception
based entirely in the mind.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.796
You see only what you want to
see when you want to see it.

Oh.

35:39.222 --> 35:40.390
Mrs. Kraftt, this is Marnie.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.391
She's here to insert
your husband's catheter.

35:43.851 --> 35:45.603
I suggest you might wanna
step outside for a second.

35:47.521 --> 35:48.773
She's far too
pretty to leave alone

35:48.815 --> 35:49.941

Well, sometimes people
just get very tired.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.208
They need to rest for awhile.

36:15.717 --> 36:17.344
Fuck that, Murray.

36:17.385 --> 36:18.219
Wake up.

36:58.342 --> 36:59.385
Hi ya, Papa.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.558
You look horrible.

37:06.601 --> 37:07.559
No offense.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.984
You shoulda seen me today.

37:16.027 --> 37:19.239
I was out on the town living
life like a real person.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.281
Yes?

37:22.659 --> 37:26.496
Here's to another
shit-filled year of life.

37:26.538 --> 37:27.706
Happy Birthday to me.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.878
I'm heading home.

37:35.755 --> 37:36.631
Bess will look after you.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.008
I'll be back in the morning.

37:43.637 --> 37:44.556
Love you.

38:20.632 --> 38:25.096
Floating
higher and higher.

38:26.222 --> 38:31.227
Float up and away.

38:44.949 --> 38:48.787
Floating higher and
higher and higher, higher.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.748
Floating, floating,
floating, floating,

38:52.791 --> 38:56.044
floating, floating,
floating, floating.

39:01.465 --> 39:04.094
Everything around
me is like a tunnel.

39:04.135 --> 39:05.762
Unreal.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.889
As if your train is
floating, floating, floating,

39:08.931 --> 39:11.350
floating, floating, floating.

39:12.811 --> 39:13.644
I feel.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.401
As if you're dreaming.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.137
Everything around
is suddenly unreal.

39:49.681 --> 39:51.807
As if in a dream.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.183
As if in a dream.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.355
Sure, two people

39:57.396 --> 39:58.690
sharing the same bizarre dream

39:58.731 --> 40:02.527
is impossible, impossible,

40:02.568 --> 40:05.447
not able to occur,
exist, or be done,

40:06.822 --> 40:08.490
beyond the bounds
of possibility,

40:09.367 --> 40:10.201
out of the question.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.413
And yet the impossible
has sure as shit happened.

40:18.876 --> 40:21.420
Funny that now I've gotten
what I've always wanted,

40:22.838 --> 40:23.757
I want more.

40:34.391 --> 40:37.019
Well, well, I'm surprised
to see you up and about.

40:37.061 --> 40:37.936
Are you pouting?

40:43.650 --> 40:44.652
You big baby.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.199
I'm a grown woman.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.574
I do not owe you an explanation

40:50.617 --> 40:51.910
of where I was last night.

40:55.246 --> 40:56.998
Will an apology make
you feel better?

40:59.626 --> 41:02.754
Fine, I'm sorry.

41:02.795 --> 41:04.088
You damn well should be.

41:15.016 --> 41:15.849
What is it?

41:26.735 --> 41:28.862
What could the two of you
possibly have in common?

41:29.822 --> 41:31.115
Why is she able to see me?

41:32.282 --> 41:34.284
Am I experiencing jealousy.

41:34.327 --> 41:35.870
I should make a note of it.

41:37.163 --> 41:38.831
Do you think
you can ever cure her?

41:40.291 --> 41:42.919
As stated, my immediate
goal is diagnosis.

41:44.503 --> 41:45.337
What about me?

41:47.382 --> 41:48.215
What about you?

41:50.175 --> 41:52.261
Do you think you
can ever cure me?

41:52.302 --> 41:53.137
I'm sure of it.

41:55.181 --> 41:56.016
How?

41:57.559 --> 41:58.810
Think about it.

41:58.851 --> 42:00.853
From the day you met
me to this very moment,

42:00.894 --> 42:03.148
you are closer to
death than ever before.

42:11.489 --> 42:12.574
Paging Dr. Stateman,

42:12.614 --> 42:14.283
Dr. Stateman please.

42:22.876 --> 42:23.710
Oh fuck!

42:57.786 --> 42:59.454
Paging Dr. Bender,

42:59.496 --> 43:01.206
paging Dr. Bender, please.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.623
Just pretend I'm not here.

43:06.585 --> 43:09.004
Murray's contracted
a bacterial infection

43:09.047 --> 43:10.423
in the lining of his heart.

43:12.257 --> 43:13.217
He's in a coma.

43:13.259 --> 43:14.260
What, how?

43:15.512 --> 43:18.390
Any surgical procedure
carries the risks

43:18.431 --> 43:21.141
of introducing bacteria
to the bloodstream.

43:21.184 --> 43:22.268
Is he gonna be okay?

43:24.019 --> 43:25.021
He's had a stroke.

43:27.606 --> 43:28.440
Is this a joke?

43:29.900 --> 43:31.735
My husband comes in here a
little unsteady on his feet

43:31.777 --> 43:33.696
and now he's a stroke
victim in a coma?

43:34.864 --> 43:36.824
Look, don't you
dare speak to me.

43:36.865 --> 43:38.492
The last thing I need
is my fruitcake daughter

43:38.534 --> 43:39.786
making a scene right now.

43:41.246 --> 43:43.081
Just so you know, I'll be
watching your every move

43:43.123 --> 43:43.956
from now on.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.251
And if my husband doesn't
make a full recovery,

43:47.293 --> 43:49.378
you're gonna wish it was
you lying in that bed.

43:51.965 --> 43:53.298
I'm sorry, Bess.

43:55.342 --> 43:58.303
Unfortunately even when
we're doing everything we can

43:58.346 --> 44:00.724
there are complications
that we can't anticipate

44:00.764 --> 44:02.349
and that are out of our control.

44:07.021 --> 44:09.231
Don't apologize, Dr. Klienart.

44:09.273 --> 44:10.942
I'm sure everything
will be okay.

44:12.985 --> 44:16.280
I hear no
voice, I feel no touch.

44:16.322 --> 44:18.450
I see no glory bright.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.242
But yet I know that God is near

44:20.284 --> 44:21.994
in darkness as in light.

44:23.579 --> 44:26.081
I heard that as a kid and
it always stuck with me.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.793
Who knows about
the whole God part.

44:29.835 --> 44:32.129
It just always helped
me feel less alone.

44:32.172 --> 44:34.590
The surgery gonna
come through, my ass.

44:34.632 --> 44:36.050
Pathetic quack.

45:17.717 --> 45:19.510
What were
you doing at the bar?

45:19.552 --> 45:21.054
I left my cell
phone last night.

45:21.096 --> 45:24.014
You said you were
at the hospital last night.

45:24.056 --> 45:28.435
I was but afterwards
I couldn't bring myself

45:28.478 --> 45:29.688
to go home.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.313
I came by here but
your lights were out

45:31.356 --> 45:32.941
so I ended up across the street.

45:34.150 --> 45:38.195
I'm at a great
disadvantage, Elizabeth.

45:40.072 --> 45:42.408
I cannot discern deception
as readily as most.

45:44.202 --> 45:45.745
I need to be able to trust you.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.715
You know
you can trust me.

46:10.103 --> 46:11.229
- I'm sorry.
- What, what's wrong?

46:11.271 --> 46:12.230
Do I have bad breath?

46:12.271 --> 46:13.690
- You can tell me.
- Wait!

46:14.815 --> 46:15.649
Sit down.

46:18.610 --> 46:19.737
Do you wanna get better or not?

46:19.778 --> 46:21.239
You know I do.

46:29.956 --> 46:30.789
Good.

46:34.793 --> 46:35.627
Good.

46:39.507 --> 46:41.550
Um, I thought

46:41.592 --> 46:43.260
I heard her this morning.

46:43.302 --> 46:44.679
Argus was acting funny.

46:46.597 --> 46:47.931
It is time
for us to undertake

46:47.974 --> 46:49.893
a new therapy technique.

46:49.934 --> 46:51.561
Are we giving
up on rebirthing?

46:51.603 --> 46:53.438
For now, yes.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.148
I want you to start
a journal of sorts.

46:56.190 --> 46:57.358
Oh not crayons again.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.693
No, no, no, no, no.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.280
Do you remember that
Russell character

47:02.322 --> 47:04.282
I tried to introduce to you?

47:04.324 --> 47:05.784
Mmm hmm.

47:05.824 --> 47:09.788
I want you to
pretend that he exists.

47:11.121 --> 47:14.125
And for you to speak
to him out loud.

47:14.166 --> 47:17.170
Familiarize yourself with
the verbal expression

47:17.211 --> 47:19.547
of your deeply hidden feelings.

47:19.588 --> 47:21.965
But there's nothing
I hide from you.

47:22.007 --> 47:23.550
Oh, I do not doubt it.

47:23.592 --> 47:24.594
You don't?

47:27.097 --> 47:28.306
Should I?

47:28.347 --> 47:29.807
What if someone sees
me talking to myself?

47:29.849 --> 47:31.184
They'll think I'm crazy.

47:31.226 --> 47:32.268
Well, are you?

47:32.309 --> 47:33.436
Am I?

47:33.478 --> 47:35.646
This is the
weirdest thing ever.

47:35.688 --> 47:36.522
Please.

47:42.362 --> 47:45.030
You know I'll try anything
if you think it'll help.

47:52.871 --> 47:55.000
Pretend he exists.

47:55.041 --> 47:56.626
Okay, what did
Farmer say call him?

47:56.668 --> 47:58.503
Rusty, Russ, I got it.

47:58.545 --> 48:02.090
Ah, Russell, Russell,
Russell, Russell, okay.

48:02.132 --> 48:05.010
Well, let's get
started, Russell.

48:09.222 --> 48:10.932
I can't believe people go
looking for a better life

48:10.974 --> 48:12.057
and end up here.

48:15.519 --> 48:16.730
I've never been anywhere.

48:18.023 --> 48:22.193
But I think about
going to a grass hut

48:22.235 --> 48:23.820
on a beach somewhere,

48:25.195 --> 48:27.364
somewhere where I
couldn't be disappointed.

48:34.706 --> 48:36.458
I called the hospital
this morning.

48:37.625 --> 48:38.918
I told the nurse
I was out of town

48:38.960 --> 48:41.086
before she could ask
why I hadn't visited.

48:45.090 --> 48:45.924
I lied.

48:51.931 --> 48:53.516
Do you lie a lot?

48:55.393 --> 48:57.853
And I know I'll
act wrong somehow.

48:57.896 --> 49:01.274
Like not sad enough or too sad.

49:03.485 --> 49:05.903
And all those people
at the hospital

49:05.945 --> 49:08.448
they'll look at
me, Dr. Klienart.

49:10.115 --> 49:13.036
Nobody will know
what to do with me.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.541

51:36.096 --> 51:38.472
much practical stuff.

51:38.514 --> 51:40.266
He musta thought that way

51:41.434 --> 51:42.769
maybe I'd always need him.

51:46.313 --> 51:47.690
I hope you don't
think I'm being rude

51:47.731 --> 51:50.235

good at small talk.

51:50.275 --> 51:53.779
So do you mind if we just
watch some TV instead?

51:56.449 --> 51:57.701
Why
someone would do this

51:57.742 --> 51:59.744
I have no idea but
as you can see,

51:59.786 --> 52:01.413
it has caused absolute mayhem.

54:33.063 --> 54:35.899
I shouldn't talk
that way about work

54:35.942 --> 54:40.405
or about anything really
if it isn't positive.

54:40.447 --> 54:42.657
No one likes you otherwise.

54:42.699 --> 54:44.034
True.

54:44.074 --> 54:45.576
Do people like you, Russell?

54:47.286 --> 54:48.120
I bet they do.

54:50.789 --> 54:52.750
I had a couple of friends.

54:54.960 --> 54:57.921
But when I came back after
working over summer vacation

54:57.963 --> 54:59.298
they all had girlfriends.

55:00.800 --> 55:04.637
You're clever and
you're handsome.

55:06.347 --> 55:07.891
And you love your parents.

55:08.974 --> 55:11.101
And you have a firm handshake.

55:11.143 --> 55:12.978
Don't forget the trust fund.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.147
What's not to like?

55:17.817 --> 55:21.445
In the morning, I wanna
introduce you to Argus.

55:22.530 --> 55:24.990
Having another handsome
young male around

55:25.032 --> 55:26.451
should bring him down a peg.

55:31.206 --> 55:32.123
Hey, Russell?

55:32.164 --> 55:32.998
Yeah.

55:34.208 --> 55:38.003
Since I'm sure you're
a very faithful person,

55:39.672 --> 55:41.298
will you say a
prayer for my dad?

56:06.532 --> 56:08.284
Oh shit.

56:08.326 --> 56:10.244
What if none of this
is real after all?

56:11.454 --> 56:15.208
What if it's just some
crazy, made up fantasy

56:15.250 --> 56:17.835
I've warped into
something true in my mind?

56:19.753 --> 56:20.713
I mean, come on.

56:23.632 --> 56:24.466
Look at her.

56:25.885 --> 56:27.595
I'm not the guy
who gets the girl.

56:29.806 --> 56:31.849
At least not that girl.

58:22.543 --> 58:24.295
I can't reach her.

58:24.336 --> 58:28.382
Mrs. Kraftt, I tried all
the numbers you gave me.

58:30.342 --> 58:32.302
The overall physical
fitness of the patient,

58:32.344 --> 58:35.097
of every patient is different,
every case is different.

58:37.182 --> 58:38.768
Despite our best efforts,

58:40.353 --> 58:43.898
the outcome is not
always what we hope for.

59:48.672 --> 59:50.130
It wasn't like that at all.

59:51.548 --> 59:53.550
We were just really close.

59:53.592 --> 59:54.426
What else?

59:56.054 --> 59:57.597
My dad left when I was 13.

01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:01.643
I had to go out and find work.

01:00:02.768 --> 01:00:05.396
I got to know my way
around a piece of wood.

01:00:05.438 --> 01:00:08.900
I worked my way up to cabinets
and wainscotting and...

01:00:11.402 --> 01:00:13.112
And then I had this moment,

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:17.951
in a massive custom kitchen.

01:00:19.911 --> 01:00:20.869
It was the dream.

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:24.124
And I didn't want it.

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:29.211
The money, success,
family, any of it.

01:00:33.507 --> 01:00:34.550
So what was left?

01:00:36.427 --> 01:00:37.261
Me.

01:00:38.929 --> 01:00:40.389
Me and the whole
load of nothing.

01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:42.474
I think I'm probably crazy.

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:47.647
It's my biggest fear actually.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.610
Then I started thinking
what if my dad's Parkinson's

01:00:53.652 --> 01:00:56.613
wasn't the reason he
kept talking to my mom.

01:00:56.655 --> 01:00:58.907
What if he was mentally ill.

01:00:58.949 --> 01:01:00.951
And that stuff runs in families.

01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:06.416
I mean, look, I'm sitting here,

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:11.046
talking out loud to some
imaginary therapy doll.

01:01:11.086 --> 01:01:12.755
Hello, that's Looney Tunes.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.677
I really don't know if I
know what's real anymore.

01:01:20.137 --> 01:01:22.306
Sometimes
I think the only hallmark

01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:23.641
of sanity is questioning

01:01:23.682 --> 01:01:25.851
whether or not you're crazy.

01:01:25.893 --> 01:01:28.145
And if you've ever
wondered, even for a moment,

01:01:28.188 --> 01:01:29.689
that you might not be

01:01:29.731 --> 01:01:33.651
all there, you're just fine.

01:01:41.784 --> 01:01:46.038
But in any case, I still
know exactly what Bess means.

01:01:52.628 --> 01:01:53.420
I would like for you

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.297
to come talk to me.

01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:57.007
I'm kinda busy here, Farmer.

01:02:01.762 --> 01:02:03.181
I want the
whole area cleared.

01:02:03.222 --> 01:02:04.014
Close 'er off.

01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:05.224
Come on, let's go.

01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:10.105
So you've
been following her.

01:02:11.188 --> 01:02:12.065
Maybe.

01:02:16.652 --> 01:02:19.571
And what
have you learned?

01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:23.326
Look, it's Bess's business
what she says to who.

01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:27.579
Bess?

01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:32.251
Everybody calls her Bess.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.005
I'm canceling the experiment.

01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:39.634
Leave Eliz, Bess, alone.

01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:41.635
Are you finished?

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.141
Why would you do that?

01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:00.155
Oh, I've got an
idea, what do you say

01:03:00.195 --> 01:03:03.407
we head back to exam C and
practice some of the stuff

01:03:03.449 --> 01:03:05.367
you've been learning
in school, hmm?

01:03:05.409 --> 01:03:07.578
We could use the refractor.

01:03:07.619 --> 01:03:09.913
Sort of a little
tutorial session.

01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:12.791
I don't know, Dr. Day.

01:03:12.833 --> 01:03:14.668
I haven't had much experience

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.588
and I wouldn't wanna
mess something up.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:19.090
Oh, get back there.

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:20.967
It'll make Bruce's day.

01:03:32.394 --> 01:03:33.938
Oh, it's strange sitting here.

01:03:35.481 --> 01:03:39.568
It's like riding in the
back seat of your own car.

01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.195
Okay.

01:03:41.237 --> 01:03:43.782
I'm gonna give you two options.

01:03:43.822 --> 01:03:46.326
Number one or number two.

01:03:46.367 --> 01:03:47.619
You just focus

01:03:47.659 --> 01:03:49.119
on the eye chart

01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:53.207
and tell me which option
makes the letters clearer.

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:55.126
Are you ready?

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:57.711
Good, Bess, very professional.

01:03:57.753 --> 01:03:58.755
Number one.

01:04:01.382 --> 01:04:03.134
Or number two?

01:04:05.594 --> 01:04:06.387
Two.

01:04:08.222 --> 01:04:09.807
Number one.

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:13.352
Or number two?

01:04:15.646 --> 01:04:16.815
Number one.

01:04:27.117 --> 01:04:28.034
Number one.

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:37.710
Or number two.

01:04:39.045 --> 01:04:39.878
Bess.

01:04:41.338 --> 01:04:44.299
What is the center point for
image focus in the retina?

01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:49.556
It's a very basic question.

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:55.019
You haven't been going
to school, have you?

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.775
I'll pay you back, I promise.

01:05:23.965 --> 01:05:25.175
Hello, Bess.

01:05:26.259 --> 01:05:27.885
Mint?

01:05:27.927 --> 01:05:29.554
You just called me Bess.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.016
Well, that is your
name, is it not?

01:05:38.271 --> 01:05:39.606
And how is your father?

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:42.399
Oh, he's doing good.

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:44.568
Much better actually.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:46.028
I just came from the hospital.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:47.654
That's strange.

01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:49.740
Dr. Klienart called
here looking for you

01:05:49.782 --> 01:05:53.744
and he told me about
your father's condition.

01:05:53.786 --> 01:05:54.788
And he is not good.

01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:57.749
He's not good at all.

01:05:58.833 --> 01:05:59.751
What are you talking about?

01:06:00.626 --> 01:06:01.543
Oh!

01:06:01.585 --> 01:06:02.753
I've spent
the last four years

01:06:02.795 --> 01:06:04.088
in this office with you without
taking a penny for my time

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.340
because I assumed this

01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:06.590
to be a mutually-beneficial
arrangement.

01:06:06.632 --> 01:06:08.884
Was I wrong to
assume that, Bess?

01:06:08.927 --> 01:06:10.095
Please calm down, Farmer.

01:06:10.135 --> 01:06:11.262
How many times
have you lied to me?

01:06:11.304 --> 01:06:13.264
How many dead ends
did you send me down?

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:14.516
Was it all a lie?

01:06:14.556 --> 01:06:15.766
Sorry, I didn't
realize that you...

01:06:15.809 --> 01:06:17.560
Sorry, sorry,
does not help me.

01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:20.355
Years and years of
falsified research

01:06:20.396 --> 01:06:21.480
so get out!

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:24.483
Get out!

01:06:30.989 --> 01:06:34.993
You fuck.

01:06:37.996 --> 01:06:39.456
I hate that I care
what you think about.

01:06:39.498 --> 01:06:41.542
Everything, I'm the one that
stole your fucking diploma

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:42.960
because I hate that you
care about your work

01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:44.461
more than you care about me

01:06:44.503 --> 01:06:46.922
even though I will never
ever fucking love you back.

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:48.967
And I hate lying to Dr. Day.

01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:51.177
Really I couldn't give
a shit about taking over

01:06:51.219 --> 01:06:52.846
the fucking practice.

01:06:52.887 --> 01:06:54.222
I couldn't give a shit
about people's eyes

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:55.306
or having a fucking career

01:06:55.347 --> 01:06:57.016
or anything like that.

01:06:57.057 --> 01:06:58.768
Well, I hate when you touch me.

01:06:58.809 --> 01:07:00.603
I hate you always tell
me how smart you are.

01:07:00.644 --> 01:07:02.813
And I hate my mother
for being weak

01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:03.940
and leaving me behind.

01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:06.275
Fuck.

01:07:06.317 --> 01:07:08.235
I hate my father for
giving up on me, too.

01:07:08.277 --> 01:07:09.737
Fucking door!

01:07:09.778 --> 01:07:11.655
I fucking had no idea how
much I really need him!

01:07:12.907 --> 01:07:14.200
Fuck!

01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:16.827
Fuck, Dad.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.669
I'm in
love with this girl.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.390
That's exactly
what I'm talking about, Murray.

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:03.935
Well,
you can't run away

01:09:03.975 --> 01:09:05.644
from getting older, Carolyn.

01:09:05.685 --> 01:09:06.979
I had her when I was 20.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.814
I never got the
chance to be young.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:11.609
Do you see the way
she looks at me?

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:15.154
It's like I'm just a mom.

01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:18.158
What do I tell Bess?

01:09:18.198 --> 01:09:19.616
I'll be gone.

01:09:19.658 --> 01:09:20.576
It won't matter.

01:09:23.953 --> 01:09:24.787
Mom!

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:39.179
Mom!

01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:56.863
Mom!

01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:04.162
Mom!

01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:08.541
Every night I dream
that I'm a bird

01:10:08.582 --> 01:10:10.167
that gets to fly away.

01:10:12.753 --> 01:10:16.966
I don't have a name and I look
just like the rest of them.

01:10:19.802 --> 01:10:21.261
I'm just leaving it all behind.

01:10:28.811 --> 01:10:29.895
I think the darkness

01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:31.355
in you is beautiful.

01:11:10.603 --> 01:11:12.021
He's real, isn't he?

01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:14.149
You saw him?

01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:15.442
I definitely heard him.

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:18.193
This is the most
important advancement

01:11:18.235 --> 01:11:21.197
in our work together, Bess.

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:24.033
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my nickname, Farmer,

01:11:24.074 --> 01:11:27.244
it's just that I like it
when you call me Elizabeth.

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:28.579
It makes me feel
like someone I'm not.

01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:29.748
What do you mean?

01:11:29.788 --> 01:11:31.291
You cannot be
someone you are not.

01:11:32.417 --> 01:11:33.293
Now you tell me?

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:35.627
I'm confused.

01:11:36.796 --> 01:11:38.465
Yeah, me, too.

01:11:41.717 --> 01:11:43.427
Am I crazy, Farmer?

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.221
Not as far as I can tell.

01:11:45.262 --> 01:11:47.306
Though, as a scientist,
I cannot rule it out

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:48.641
until I prove it otherwise.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.688
He said something to
me I've been waiting

01:11:53.729 --> 01:11:54.813
my whole life to hear.

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:58.318
What's all that?

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.694
That's Russell.

01:12:01.529 --> 01:12:02.364
It is?

01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:05.282
He's the guy tearing
down the arcade.

01:12:05.324 --> 01:12:06.617
No, I don't wanna see him.

01:12:06.658 --> 01:12:08.077
Wait, Elizabeth.

01:12:08.118 --> 01:12:09.787
Please don't tell him
that I know anything, okay?

01:12:09.828 --> 01:12:12.873
Not yet, Farmer,
promise me, please.

01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:15.835
I promise.

01:12:17.252 --> 01:12:18.253
Thank you.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.594
Oh hey.

01:12:49.953 --> 01:12:51.162
You are upset with me.

01:12:54.207 --> 01:12:57.085
I've apologized to Elizabeth
for my regrettable outburst

01:12:57.127 --> 01:13:00.046
and she has forgiven me and
I hope you can do the same.

01:13:06.886 --> 01:13:08.805
Do you think she wants
to be an optometrist?

01:13:11.682 --> 01:13:14.310
That she wants to
be your girlfriend?

01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:19.524
She even made her mother vanish.

01:13:19.565 --> 01:13:20.983
For fuck sake, Farmer.

01:13:21.025 --> 01:13:25.320
She'll do whatever
anyone wants her to do.

01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:26.197
Look at her.

01:13:46.216 --> 01:13:48.635
You know what it
means, don't you?

01:13:48.677 --> 01:13:51.347
The fact that this is nothing
more than a fairy tale.

01:13:55.601 --> 01:13:59.064
Some Aesop, Mother
Goose bullshit.

01:14:00.774 --> 01:14:02.108
It means I'm cursed.

01:14:03.734 --> 01:14:06.403
It means Bess is never
actually going to see me

01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:07.447
in real life.

01:14:09.239 --> 01:14:10.657
She'll stay just

01:14:10.699 --> 01:14:14.453
out of reach forever.

There's no dream to

01:14:36.975 --> 01:14:38.185
The shackles are off.

01:14:39.104 --> 01:14:41.481

Oh fuck!

01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:47.440
Thank
you for calling me.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:52.195
I can't believe
I'm back here again,

01:16:52.237 --> 01:16:53.947
the scene of the crime.

01:16:55.114 --> 01:16:56.573
The death of your
father does not qualify

01:16:56.615 --> 01:16:58.201
as a crime, Elizabeth.

01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:59.619
Oh, you didn't know?

01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:01.246
I killed him.

01:17:01.287 --> 01:17:02.539
Yeah, it's true.

01:17:02.579 --> 01:17:04.666
The surgery wasn't necessary.

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:08.460
It coulda been put off for
months, years, who knows.

01:17:08.502 --> 01:17:09.795
My dad is dead.

01:17:13.466 --> 01:17:14.300
My dad is dead.

01:17:15.635 --> 01:17:16.970
I can't make it feel real.

01:17:19.596 --> 01:17:20.764
I don't know why
that surprises me.

01:17:20.806 --> 01:17:21.890
I don't know how
to feel anything.

01:17:21.932 --> 01:17:23.100
That is not true.

01:17:24.185 --> 01:17:25.562
You feel everything.

01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:29.023
It's an integral
part of your problem.

01:17:29.064 --> 01:17:30.524
You figured out my problem?

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.945
Well, I'm in the late stages
of winnowing hypotheses.

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:36.614
Do any of them
address the fact

01:17:36.655 --> 01:17:39.492
that the one person who
made me feel something

01:17:39.533 --> 01:17:41.493
for the first time in years

01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:43.579
is having his wrist
bandaged as we speak?

01:17:46.623 --> 01:17:48.376
I do not make
you feel anything?

01:17:53.213 --> 01:17:55.800
You want me to lie to you?

01:17:55.841 --> 01:17:56.675
No.

01:18:00.846 --> 01:18:02.474
So when you were kissing me

01:18:02.515 --> 01:18:05.518
you were merely
pretending to enjoy it

01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:09.856
'cause you thought that
was what I might want.

01:18:15.862 --> 01:18:16.654
I love you.

01:18:16.695 --> 01:18:18.323
No, you don't.

01:18:18.364 --> 01:18:19.365
You love your work.

01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:21.534
And you are my work.

01:18:21.576 --> 01:18:22.409
Ms. Kraftt.

01:18:22.452 --> 01:18:23.494
Yes.

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:24.412
Your friend is
stable and resting.

01:18:24.453 --> 01:18:25.329
He's okay?

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:26.289
Yes, but he made it very clear

01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.164
he doesn't wanna see you.

01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:28.041
I'm sorry.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.505
Um, it's okay.

01:18:33.546 --> 01:18:34.381
I understand.

01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:40.636
Elizabeth.

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:46.600
I think we should break up.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:51.981
HOSPITAL
ANNOUNCER: In disease,

01:18:52.023 --> 01:18:54.818
Dr. Peter Honeycowell-Kating.

01:18:54.859 --> 01:18:56.945
Dr. Peter Honeycowell-Kating.

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:20.677
Remember what you said
to me before the accident

01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:21.845
about wanting more?

01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:26.765
Did you know that Bessie
has seen the interstate once

01:19:26.807 --> 01:19:27.641
in her life.

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.020
The only reason she
doesn't move away

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.229
like every kid she
grew up with is me.

01:19:33.398 --> 01:19:34.565
There's nothing for her here.

01:19:34.606 --> 01:19:36.984
She stays to take care of me.

01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:37.902
Well, she doesn't have to.

01:19:37.944 --> 01:19:38.778
I'm here.

01:19:41.113 --> 01:19:44.491
You know that being strong
isn't one of my strengths.

01:19:44.533 --> 01:19:47.411
It's the curse of
the Kraftt women.

01:19:47.453 --> 01:19:50.456
You have no idea how
strong you really are.

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.340
Bess saved my life.

01:21:23.716 --> 01:21:26.885
Blew apart all that tough guy
don't need nobody bullshit

01:21:26.927 --> 01:21:28.387
and made me want to live.

01:21:31.015 --> 01:21:32.391
Just like in a fairy tale.

01:21:37.021 --> 01:21:39.733
Maybe there is some magic
in the real world after all.

01:22:06.342 --> 01:22:07.426
Yeah, I know.

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:09.762
Come on, you jerk.

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:13.475
Mating season's coming
and if you don't eat,

01:22:13.515 --> 01:22:16.143
you won't be able to...

01:22:16.185 --> 01:22:17.353
You know what?

01:22:18.688 --> 01:22:20.690
You don't have to eat
if you don't want to.

01:22:23.275 --> 01:22:24.277
As a matter of fact,

01:22:25.653 --> 01:22:27.947
seriously, go,

01:22:30.699 --> 01:22:34.662
be free.

01:22:48.885 --> 01:22:49.719
Oh.

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:53.472
Argus.

01:23:02.774 --> 01:23:05.443
I think the darkness
in you is beautiful.

01:24:49.338 --> 01:24:50.172
Bess?

01:26:09.668 --> 01:26:11.296
I think you might be here.

01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:18.636
I can't see you but
maybe I can feel you.

01:26:22.931 --> 01:26:24.809
Dad was right about everything.

01:26:27.811 --> 01:26:28.645
Yes.

01:26:36.195 --> 01:26:37.029
Bess.

01:27:11.814 --> 01:27:12.898
Your eyes are green.

01:27:14.442 --> 01:27:15.275
Yeah.

01:27:17.112 --> 01:27:21.533
And my hands are rough and
my fingernails are dirty

01:27:21.573 --> 01:27:24.493
and I can't ever seem
to get 'em clean.

01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:27.663
I'm pretty hairy, too.

01:27:29.289 --> 01:27:30.542
I shed a lot like a dog.

01:27:32.752 --> 01:27:36.256
And I don't have any
friends or a trust fund or...

01:27:36.296 --> 01:27:38.298
What if I told
you I didn't care?

01:27:42.845 --> 01:27:45.264
I would think you're
lying like you always do.

01:27:46.932 --> 01:27:48.393
But I've never lied to you.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.634
Turns
out the old saying is wrong.

01:28:21.676 --> 01:28:24.095
Seeing is not believing.

01:28:24.136 --> 01:28:27.097
Please don't disappear again.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.351
Not
with the eyes at least.

01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:32.479
They're just a bunch of
rods and cones and jelly.

01:28:33.854 --> 01:28:36.774
If you want to talk about
seeing with the heart,

01:28:36.815 --> 01:28:38.108
you know where to find me.

01:28:39.194 --> 01:28:41.279
I'll be right here
with this girl forever.
