RED DWARF - S11E03 - GIVE & TAKE
In memory of J.H.S. SAS MBE - Now there was a lad.

00:54.678 --> 00:56.398
Lift coming, Sir.

00:57.818 --> 00:58.854
Come on,
Come on!

00:58.855 --> 01:01.018
Why are you always so slow?!

01:01.019 --> 01:03.781
I've seen snails with clubbed feet
travel faster than you.

01:03.782 --> 01:06.209
The French Army after
lunch move quicker!

01:06.210 --> 01:07.810
Not long now, Sir.

01:07.866 --> 01:09.214
I'm picking up
several strange

01:09.215 --> 01:11.144
energy signatures
on B deck.

01:11.145 --> 01:12.989
I need a lift pronto to
check them out.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.668
Just a drop-off on
the living quarters

01:14.669 --> 01:16.247
and I'll be with you
in a flash, Sir.

01:16.248 --> 01:17.137
Will you really?

01:17.138 --> 01:19.438
Or will you really be
a really long time?

01:19.439 --> 01:21.339
A really long time, Sir.

01:21.408 --> 01:23.647
So why not tell me that
in the first place then?

01:23.648 --> 01:25.725
I didn't want to
lose your custom.

01:25.726 --> 01:27.569
Who can you lose
my custom to?

01:27.570 --> 01:28.819
Our main rival, Sir-

01:28.820 --> 01:30.377
the stairs.

01:31.836 --> 01:33.647
They've been doing
really well this year.

01:33.648 --> 01:34.678
Where are you now?

01:34.679 --> 01:37.402
I've completed the drop-off
at the living quarter's deck, Sir

01:37.403 --> 01:39.559
now I've just gotta trip up
to the stasis booths.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.610
But I pressed first!

01:41.630 --> 01:43.168
Right. That's it.
You are fired.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.911
You can't fire a lift, Sir.

01:44.912 --> 01:45.723
I just have.

01:45.724 --> 01:47.291
How are you going
to replace me?

01:47.292 --> 01:49.244
With another lift
from another shaft.

01:49.245 --> 01:51.463
I'll get the scutters to
transfer and install.

01:51.464 --> 01:53.182
Let me tell you,
my lad-do,

01:53.183 --> 01:55.656
There are plenty of young,
thrusting lifts around here

01:55.657 --> 01:57.547
who would give their
eye teeth to transport

01:57.548 --> 02:00.472
someone of my stature
up and down their shaft.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.459
Tell all lifts we're interviewing
for a new position in Shaft 14.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.428
All applicants must be
prepared to travel.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.603
Only lifts need apply.

02:12.429 --> 02:13.556
Come on.

02:29.155 --> 02:30.326
Lights!

02:30.327 --> 02:32.972
Lister, you've been in
my bunk for two days now.

02:32.973 --> 02:34.593
Are you still hung over?

02:34.594 --> 02:36.906
Go away, Rimmer.
Turn off the lights.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.553
Look, we've come across
a space station,

02:38.554 --> 02:39.750
tech glitch in Sector Three,

02:39.751 --> 02:41.375
there's an asteroid storm
heading for it,

02:41.376 --> 02:42.584
it will be toast
in five hours!

02:42.585 --> 02:43.853
Let's go!

02:43.872 --> 02:45.168
Gimme a break, Rimmer.

02:45.169 --> 02:46.933
I've been in bed
for two days.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.718
I need to freshen up.

02:49.871 --> 02:50.855
All right.

02:50.856 --> 02:52.556
Good to go!
Come on!

03:01.521 --> 03:04.036
What kind of
space station is it, Krytes?

03:04.037 --> 03:04.796
Any idea?

03:04.797 --> 03:06.395
Well I don't recognize it, Sir,

03:06.396 --> 03:08.270
but I must confess I did delete

03:08.271 --> 03:10.411
some files off my
hard drive this morning

03:10.412 --> 03:11.880
to create more memory.

03:11.881 --> 03:13.348
Really?
Is that safe?

03:13.349 --> 03:14.536
Oh, have no fear, Sir.

03:14.537 --> 03:17.714
I only trashed information
I consider frivolous and idiotic.

03:17.715 --> 03:20.057
Without checking with me first?

03:20.058 --> 03:21.327
And you are...?

03:22.386 --> 03:24.760
Go into your trash,
you mental moron,

03:24.761 --> 03:26.844
and un-delete the Rimmer folder.

03:26.845 --> 03:29.019
You must have dumped me
in there by mistake.

03:29.204 --> 03:30.953
That's highly unlikely,
whoever you are,

03:30.954 --> 03:32.957
but I'll check anyway.

03:33.154 --> 03:33.953
Oh!

03:33.954 --> 03:35.625
There's a folder in here

03:35.626 --> 03:37.234
marked "Captain Bollocks".

03:37.235 --> 03:38.735
Could that be you?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.458
Captain Bollocks?

03:41.459 --> 03:43.130
Is that what you call me
behind my back?

03:43.131 --> 03:45.614
To your face too,
when you're snoozing!

03:45.615 --> 03:48.383
Just dragging it out
of the bin and reinstalling.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.041
Oh, Sir!

03:51.042 --> 03:52.395
I'm so sorry!

03:52.396 --> 03:53.379
How could I possibly...

03:53.380 --> 03:54.666
Yes! All right,
moving on.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.791
Calling you
Captain Bollocks!

03:57.141 --> 03:58.765
Especially behind your back,

03:58.766 --> 04:00.562
and probably sniggering
about it too -

04:00.563 --> 04:02.135
how could you not
take offense?!

04:02.136 --> 04:03.954
Kryten, please.
Let's move on.

04:03.955 --> 04:06.203
Captain Bollocks!
Really?!

04:06.204 --> 04:09.016
It's disrespectful and
downright offensive, Sir.

04:09.017 --> 04:11.802
Just assure me
I'm fully reinstalled.

04:11.803 --> 04:12.865
Rest assured, Sir.

04:12.866 --> 04:15.636
You now have pride of place
in my "R" section.

04:15.637 --> 04:19.233
Alongside "ringworm"
and "rim shot", Sir.

04:34.838 --> 04:35.837
Now remember, Sirs.

04:35.838 --> 04:38.477
The asteroid storm will
destroy the station

04:38.478 --> 04:40.075
in five hours.

04:42.396 --> 04:44.895
Look, let's split up
into pairs.

04:44.896 --> 04:47.265
It will make things
a whole lot quicker.

04:47.266 --> 04:51.212
As acting superior officer,
I naturally get first choice.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.040
Don't want you.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.806
Don't want you.

04:56.037 --> 04:58.368
Why is there
no one good here?

04:58.928 --> 05:01.895
You get more choice
in an Amish barbers.

05:02.434 --> 05:03.639
Kryten,

05:03.693 --> 05:06.393
You're with me.
Let's move, people.

05:06.915 --> 05:10.213
If they ever decide to recognize
service to toss pottery,

05:10.214 --> 05:12.114
he'll be a Hall of Famer.

05:18.761 --> 05:20.913
I wonder why it's called
"Asclepius".

05:20.914 --> 05:24.660
Ah. Presumably after the
Greek god of medicine, Sir.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.225
Well, there's that.
Obviously.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.022
Obviously that.
Yes, obviously.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.791
You think it's that obvious?

05:39.771 --> 05:40.739
Skeleton!

05:40.740 --> 05:42.677
Check it out.

05:42.678 --> 05:43.930
My bet?

05:44.025 --> 05:45.568
It's dead.

05:50.178 --> 05:53.211
Why do skeletons
never wear any clothes?

05:53.668 --> 05:55.501
No wonder they all die.

05:56.137 --> 05:57.698
Probably pneumonia.

05:57.699 --> 06:01.095
All right, Male.
Caucasian. Thirty one.

06:01.096 --> 06:03.069
And according to this,
he was a Colonel Club cardholder -

06:03.070 --> 06:06.458
one chicken stamp away from
a free Family Fun bucket.

06:06.924 --> 06:08.723
Man that thing's accurate!

06:09.798 --> 06:11.697
It's weird.

06:12.617 --> 06:14.041
The DNA,

06:15.210 --> 06:16.568
on this knife handle,

06:16.569 --> 06:18.291
is identical,

06:18.507 --> 06:20.431
to the DNA in the body.

06:20.685 --> 06:23.381
Meaning this dude
stabbed himself in the back?

06:23.382 --> 06:25.415
Why would anyone do that?!

06:25.418 --> 06:26.618
Hey.

06:26.630 --> 06:31.289
Some notes here.
Might give us a clue.

06:32.908 --> 06:36.016
If memory serves, Sir,
Asclepius was a medi-bot,

06:36.017 --> 06:38.678
created in the
late 23rd century,

06:38.679 --> 06:40.709
programed to perform
all the procedures,

06:40.710 --> 06:42.131
both physical and mental on

06:42.132 --> 06:44.350
all known living organisms -

06:44.351 --> 06:48.026
the cutting-edge of
droid technology.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.498
Looks like something out of an
old sci-fi movie.

06:53.573 --> 06:56.494
It's got to be so much more
advanced than me, Sir.

06:56.495 --> 06:57.697
It's got four buttons.

06:57.698 --> 06:58.967
Precisely!

07:02.844 --> 07:05.544
Greetings.
How can I be of service?

07:05.876 --> 07:08.916
I am Standing Acting Senior

07:08.917 --> 07:11.375
Commanding Officer
Arnold J. Rimmer

07:11.376 --> 07:13.734
of the J.M.C. mining ship
Red Dwarf.

07:13.735 --> 07:14.765
Perhaps you could..

07:14.766 --> 07:17.056
Sir, you haven't
introduced me.

07:17.147 --> 07:18.661
I beg your pardon.

07:18.662 --> 07:20.911
This is Kryten.
He's a sanitation droid -

07:20.912 --> 07:21.948
mainly toilets.

07:21.949 --> 07:24.440
He can also unblock drains,
and is an absolute whiz

07:24.441 --> 07:26.608
when it comes to
embarrassing stains.

07:27.653 --> 07:29.652
Sir, I merely asked you
to introduce me,

07:29.653 --> 07:31.227
you didn't have to
big me up.

07:31.565 --> 07:33.048
Arnold J. Rimmer?

07:33.049 --> 07:34.564
I do believe
many years ago,

07:34.565 --> 07:37.220
I had the honor of serving
one of your old crew mates,

07:37.221 --> 07:39.332
Flight Coordinator
Ronald Littlewood.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.804
Sir, our quake timings
are way out.

07:42.805 --> 07:44.770
We need to get back
to Red Dwarf.

07:44.820 --> 07:45.507
I wonder,

07:45.508 --> 07:46.950
would you care to join us?

07:46.951 --> 07:49.325
We have nothing
in our science room

07:49.326 --> 07:51.916
remotely as
sophisticated as you.

07:51.936 --> 07:54.231
Why, I would
be honored, Kryten.

07:54.232 --> 07:55.510
Follow me.

08:05.197 --> 08:06.915
According to these notes,

08:06.916 --> 08:09.647
the guy's name is
Romero G. Gonzales,

08:09.648 --> 08:12.285
and he was a
stasis booth engineer.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.024
Ah, Mrs. Robertson,

08:14.025 --> 08:17.660
we're ready to start
your procedure now.

08:17.792 --> 08:21.136
And this, must be
Mrs. Johnson -

08:21.406 --> 08:22.987
the donor.

08:22.988 --> 08:25.621
No need to be frightened.

08:25.622 --> 08:27.108
There was
a time I was

08:27.109 --> 08:30.055
a teensy, tiny,
teeny-weeny bit...

08:30.056 --> 08:32.067
MAD!!!

08:32.068 --> 08:33.472
But not any more.

08:33.474 --> 08:34.722
Look.

08:34.724 --> 08:37.424
There's my "all clear".

08:37.849 --> 08:38.825
We gotta go.

08:38.826 --> 08:40.014
We'll close the door
behind us

08:40.015 --> 08:40.971
as we pedal out!

08:40.972 --> 08:42.710
I can see you're both quite...

08:42.711 --> 08:44.174
nervous.

08:44.174 --> 08:47.045
Perhaps you need
a little something to help you

08:47.046 --> 08:48.183
... relax.

08:48.331 --> 08:50.531
Bazookoids!

08:52.671 --> 08:53.549
There.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.840
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

08:57.942 --> 08:58.957
Where are they?

08:58.958 --> 09:00.422
Tracking them, Sir.

09:00.423 --> 09:01.927
Down here!

09:02.528 --> 09:03.934
Sew,
sew,

09:03.935 --> 09:05.794
sew your boat,

09:05.927 --> 09:08.958
gently as you dream,

09:09.208 --> 09:10.769
Merrily,
merrily,

09:10.770 --> 09:12.962
merrily,
merrily,

09:13.368 --> 09:14.790
life is such a

09:14.791 --> 09:16.165
scream...

09:28.092 --> 09:29.222
Ah!

09:29.223 --> 09:32.503
Mrs. Biddle.
You're a little early.

09:32.504 --> 09:34.324
Take a seat in the waiting room.

09:35.238 --> 09:37.391
I'll show you where it is.

09:56.399 --> 09:59.489
Sir, let's fire them up
and get them out of here!

10:10.620 --> 10:12.635
Move, Kryten.
Go!

10:12.963 --> 10:14.550
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:49.253 --> 10:50.878
He's coming around, Sir.

10:50.879 --> 10:51.886
Here he comes.

10:52.241 --> 10:54.108
Yes, he's coming around!

10:55.737 --> 10:57.480
I don't remember
drinking anything!

10:57.905 --> 10:58.897
You were attacked, Sir.

10:58.898 --> 11:00.441
Remember?
Attacked!

11:00.442 --> 11:02.887
I didn't start it,
and I wasn't drunk.

11:03.645 --> 11:06.110
Well, I might have been drunk,
but I didn't start it.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.239
Well, I might have
started it.

11:09.309 --> 11:10.885
I remember now!
How's the Cat?!

11:10.886 --> 11:13.153
He's in medi-bay four, Sir.
He's fine.

11:13.154 --> 11:13.798
And me?

11:13.799 --> 11:14.618
Ah, the Cat -

11:14.619 --> 11:17.177
he's 100%
tippity top, Sir!

11:17.178 --> 11:18.842
Yeah, but what
about me?!

11:18.975 --> 11:20.308
Prepare yourself,

11:20.362 --> 11:21.747
for a bit
of a shock, Sir.

11:21.748 --> 11:22.975
What kind of a shock?

11:22.976 --> 11:25.275
Well, if most shocks
are about this size,

11:25.276 --> 11:26.784
this shock is more...

11:26.785 --> 11:28.664
THIS size!

11:30.554 --> 11:32.819
You have a problem
with your kidneys, Sir.

11:32.820 --> 11:34.050
What kind of problem?

11:34.051 --> 11:35.518
You don't have any.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.774
That crazy droid
organ-napped them.

11:38.775 --> 11:41.308
And when we Marined
our way in to save you,

11:41.393 --> 11:43.726
friendly-fire took
out the jar.

11:43.795 --> 11:46.572
And which particular friend
caused this friendly fire?

11:47.135 --> 11:49.135
Put it there,
pal of mine.

11:50.064 --> 11:51.470
Where am I
going to get

11:51.471 --> 11:53.459
new kidneys
3 million years

11:53.460 --> 11:54.573
into deep space?!

11:54.574 --> 11:56.550
Didn't I tell you
he'd say that?

11:56.605 --> 11:58.616
Hang on a minute.
No kidneys?

11:58.617 --> 11:59.968
How come I'm not dead?

12:00.003 --> 12:01.643
Well, I've injected a homemade

12:01.644 --> 12:03.906
MTK chip into your
bloodstream, Sir,

12:03.907 --> 12:06.055
which performs a function
similar to the old

12:06.056 --> 12:08.731
dialysis machine
of days gone by.

12:08.732 --> 12:09.746
All being well,

12:09.747 --> 12:11.393
you'll be fine for...uhm,

12:11.394 --> 12:12.344
Years?

12:12.345 --> 12:13.238
Months?

12:13.239 --> 12:14.128
Weeks?

12:14.129 --> 12:16.787
Let's not get bogged down
in details, Sir.

12:17.368 --> 12:18.852
I'm totally smegged,
aren't I?

12:18.853 --> 12:21.253
Didn't I tell you
he'd say that?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.048
All is not lost, Sir.

12:23.049 --> 12:24.962
The perpetrator of
this act of derangement

12:24.963 --> 12:27.325
was clearly some
mentally unhinged

12:27.326 --> 12:28.985
droid/patient,
who managed to

12:28.986 --> 12:30.333
escape his shackles.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.345
Mr. Rimmer and I,
however,

12:32.346 --> 12:34.276
managed to obtain
the services

12:34.277 --> 12:37.619
of a state-of-the-art
medi-bot!

12:49.802 --> 12:52.653
He's a state-of-the-art
medi-bot?!

12:52.666 --> 12:54.633
He's only got
four buttons!

12:55.210 --> 12:56.615
He goes by
the name

12:56.616 --> 12:58.097
of Asclepius.

12:58.098 --> 12:59.074
Asclepius?

12:59.075 --> 13:00.522
Kryten, can we talk?

13:00.618 --> 13:02.433
Just one moment, Asclepius.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.796
Or should that be
"Mr." Asclepius?

13:04.797 --> 13:06.543
Actually, neither.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.269
Pardon my faux pas,
Professor.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.451
Now, where was I?

13:09.452 --> 13:12.126
Ah - one of Asclepius'
many abilities

13:12.127 --> 13:14.119
is DNA re-writing

13:14.120 --> 13:17.010
If Mr. Cat were willing
to donate one of his kidneys,

13:17.011 --> 13:19.918
Asclepius here could make
his kidney compatible

13:19.919 --> 13:21.019
with your body.

13:21.286 --> 13:23.143
This is the Cat
we're talking about!

13:23.356 --> 13:25.897
The one with the big black
bog brush on his head.

13:26.301 --> 13:28.980
You're expecting me
to ask him for a kidney?

13:28.981 --> 13:31.363
He's never given anyone
anything in his life.

13:31.364 --> 13:34.056
Wh-when we explain the
importance, the idea of him

13:34.057 --> 13:35.957
being a donor might appeal.

13:36.127 --> 13:37.865
Kryten, read
the cat dictionary.

13:37.866 --> 13:39.957
There's only one
meaning for "donor".

13:39.995 --> 13:41.579
A kind of kabob.

13:42.983 --> 13:45.075
He's a cat.
He can't help himself.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.947
He has his selfish side,

13:46.948 --> 13:48.957
But if it wasn't for you, Sir,
he wouldn't exist -

13:48.958 --> 13:50.597
neither would his species.

13:50.598 --> 13:52.355
Plus, Sir, you're buds.

13:52.356 --> 13:55.056
He'll come through,
of course he will!

13:55.950 --> 13:58.159
Didn't I tell you
he'd look like that?

14:13.731 --> 14:14.940
Hey, hey, hey!

14:15.157 --> 14:16.425
How ya doin', Bud?!

14:16.426 --> 14:17.519
They said you
wanted to see me.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.202
Cat, take a seat.

14:19.766 --> 14:20.722
What have they told ya?

14:20.723 --> 14:21.738
What's to tell?

14:21.739 --> 14:23.398
We all got out in
one piece, right?

14:23.399 --> 14:24.375
Right.

14:24.393 --> 14:25.723
Erm...

14:25.760 --> 14:28.103
Listen, I've got a
really big favor to ask you.

14:28.104 --> 14:29.060
Go ahead, ask!

14:29.061 --> 14:30.310
Forgive the interruption, Sir.

14:30.311 --> 14:31.892
I suddenly remembered
you haven't eaten.

14:31.893 --> 14:32.712
Here you go.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.919
Soup, a roll,
and a vitamin booster.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.266
Great!
I'm famished.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.080
But that was for...

14:40.037 --> 14:41.147
I'll get some more, Sir.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.715
I don't want any more!

14:43.082 --> 14:44.627
I just need a main course.

14:44.644 --> 14:45.874
And get me one of
those drip things,

14:45.875 --> 14:47.539
like he's got.

14:48.132 --> 14:50.442
Listen Cat,
as I was saying...

14:50.522 --> 14:52.408
And some
Himalayan sea salt!

14:52.762 --> 14:53.603
Listen Cat...

14:53.604 --> 14:55.147
You wanted to
ask me something?

14:55.260 --> 14:57.274
Yeah. Look, I'm not going to
beat about the bush here,

14:57.275 --> 14:58.989
I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.677
Just going to come
right out and say it.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.643
I'm not going to beat
about the bush.

15:02.644 --> 15:04.306
I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

15:05.519 --> 15:06.419
In a minute.

15:08.093 --> 15:09.708
I need you to....

15:11.898 --> 15:13.333
give me....

15:14.349 --> 15:15.782
one of your kidneys.

15:16.021 --> 15:16.980
Kidneys?!

15:17.380 --> 15:18.634
This is fish!

15:20.495 --> 15:22.445
Not the food, you doink -
the organ!

15:22.446 --> 15:24.404
That crazy droid
organ-napped mine,

15:24.405 --> 15:26.504
then they got nuked
in the gunfight.

15:26.561 --> 15:27.693
So let me
get this straight;

15:27.694 --> 15:29.253
I give you one of
my kidneys,

15:29.254 --> 15:30.464
what do I get?

15:30.465 --> 15:31.674
A hole.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.510
Where your
kidney used to be.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.459
So, I give you a kidney,
you give me a hole?

15:40.460 --> 15:41.978
You keep the kidney,
I keep the hole?

15:41.979 --> 15:43.079
My gift to you.

15:43.565 --> 15:44.593
I tell you what,

15:44.594 --> 15:46.367
it's not your kidneys that
need replacing,

15:46.368 --> 15:47.804
it's your damn brain!

15:47.805 --> 15:49.435
Cat, if you don't give me
a kidney and I die,

15:49.436 --> 15:51.067
think how you'll feel!

15:51.068 --> 15:52.525
Better than you!!

15:54.636 --> 15:56.174
You know what,
I think this is all a front

15:56.175 --> 15:57.359
from you.
It's just all a front.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.796
Because I know you.
I know you.

15:59.005 --> 16:00.729
And when push
comes to shove,

16:00.753 --> 16:02.386
you'll do what's right.

16:02.756 --> 16:04.856
W-well I won't do what's right!

16:05.152 --> 16:06.985
I hate doing what's right!!

16:08.269 --> 16:09.753
All these years
being together,

16:09.754 --> 16:11.721
you think someone
knows you!

16:12.254 --> 16:14.487
You don't
know me at all!!

16:17.594 --> 16:19.311
Where's that sea salt!

16:21.266 --> 16:23.746
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?!?

16:26.582 --> 16:28.300
Ah. I thought you
might be here.

16:28.301 --> 16:30.133
How can I be
of service, Sir?

16:30.134 --> 16:33.114
I'd quite like to see you
with regard to your...

16:33.137 --> 16:35.123
psychiatric skills.

16:36.016 --> 16:38.530
I've got some issues
with my father,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.911
who I discovered
wasn't my father,

16:40.912 --> 16:43.254
Also, I've got some issues
with my mother,

16:43.255 --> 16:45.565
who very sadly
is my mother.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.956
Also, I've got brothers.

16:47.957 --> 16:49.857
I should probably sit down.

16:50.569 --> 16:52.200
But when I woke up
in the morning,

16:52.201 --> 16:53.138
she was gone.

16:53.139 --> 16:54.880
And so was the lettuce.

16:56.253 --> 16:59.220
Why would anyone do that
to my teddy bear?

16:59.747 --> 17:01.709
And she was
shouting at me!

17:01.710 --> 17:02.683
More talcum powder,

17:02.684 --> 17:03.967
more talcum powder!

17:03.968 --> 17:06.567
But I didn't have any
talcum powder!

17:08.912 --> 17:11.903
Why did she get
the green crayon?

17:13.769 --> 17:15.287
So, what do you think?

17:15.288 --> 17:16.867
You've said nothing
all session,

17:16.867 --> 17:18.186
and if you don't
say anything,

17:18.188 --> 17:20.898
how can I ever feel
better about myself?

17:22.646 --> 17:26.012
Unless, of course,
you're doing it deliberately.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.323
But why?

17:29.495 --> 17:30.924
You want me,

17:30.925 --> 17:33.670
to realize the only person
who can help me,

17:33.671 --> 17:35.252
is me!

17:35.253 --> 17:37.843
My god, that's just cut
straight to the heart of it.

17:37.844 --> 17:39.661
No wonder they call
you brilliant!

17:39.662 --> 17:41.460
I confess I was
skeptical at first,

17:41.461 --> 17:42.811
I think it was the
egg-flipper thing

17:42.812 --> 17:44.627
that rotates on your head
that put me off,

17:44.628 --> 17:46.756
but you are right -
it's about me,

17:46.757 --> 17:48.605
I've got to look
inside myself

17:48.606 --> 17:50.634
and find my own hero!

17:51.745 --> 17:53.138
Is that "time up"?

17:55.142 --> 17:56.742
Look, I'll see you
next session.

17:59.963 --> 18:01.845
Well, he said no.

18:01.846 --> 18:03.946
What are we going to do?

18:04.306 --> 18:05.873
Well I've got an idea.

18:06.111 --> 18:07.833
How's your "lie mode" these days?

18:07.834 --> 18:10.292
You still do that crazy,
nervous stuttery thing?

18:10.293 --> 18:11.406
Please, Sir.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.745
I am now fluent in all
the deceptive arts.

18:14.746 --> 18:16.674
I could work
for FIFA!

18:27.107 --> 18:28.457
Ah, there you are, Sir.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.159
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

18:30.160 --> 18:30.962
There's been the most

18:30.963 --> 18:33.660
t-t-t-t-t-t-terrible mix up

18:33.661 --> 18:36.116
with the m-m-m-medical results.

18:36.117 --> 18:36.937
Mix up?!

18:36.938 --> 18:37.758
Yes Sir.

18:37.759 --> 18:40.386
It's not Mr.-m-Mr.-m-Mr. Lister

18:40.387 --> 18:41.626
who needs
a new kidney, Sir -

18:41.627 --> 18:42.560
it's you!

18:42.561 --> 18:43.224
Me?!

18:43.225 --> 18:44.558
Yes Sir, you!

18:44.559 --> 18:45.960
I'll need a new kidney?!

18:45.961 --> 18:49.945
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-yes, Sir.

18:49.946 --> 18:53.675
I must go and tell Mr. Lister.
He will be so pleased!

18:53.676 --> 18:55.623
Hey, no-no-no-wait!
Slow down!

18:55.624 --> 18:57.716
I need to see him first!

19:01.962 --> 19:04.404
Hey there Buddy,
I've come to tuck you in!

19:06.195 --> 19:07.279
Okay.

19:07.422 --> 19:08.435
Here I go,

19:10.597 --> 19:13.358
Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck,
tucky, tucky, tuck!

19:13.500 --> 19:16.645
Tucky, tucky, tucky, tucky,
tuck, tuck, tuck.

19:16.646 --> 19:18.200
Oh, by the way,

19:18.201 --> 19:20.652
I thought about what you said
about the kidney thing?

19:20.653 --> 19:22.000
And I thought...

19:22.001 --> 19:22.993
What would you do

19:22.994 --> 19:25.142
if this whole situation
was reversed?

19:25.143 --> 19:26.006
You know what I'd do.

19:26.007 --> 19:27.927
I'd give you a kidney in
ten seconds flat.

19:27.928 --> 19:30.075
That's why I'm going to give
you one of my kidneys.

19:30.101 --> 19:31.473
No way!

19:33.895 --> 19:35.199
It's yours, Bud!

19:35.200 --> 19:37.509
Just slice me open
and haul it out.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.623
And while
you're in there,

19:38.624 --> 19:40.122
if you take a shine
to anything else,

19:40.123 --> 19:41.556
just grab that, too!

19:42.217 --> 19:44.642
You want 20 yards
of my lower intestine?

19:44.738 --> 19:47.077
Just unroll that sucker,
throw it over your shoulder

19:47.078 --> 19:48.079
and stroll on out!

19:48.080 --> 19:50.843
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

19:51.035 --> 19:54.768
Budskis 'til the day I get my
first wrinkle, right?!

19:55.428 --> 19:56.418
Right.

19:56.637 --> 19:58.026
What's this?

19:58.687 --> 20:00.350
Consent form.
You need to sign it.

20:00.351 --> 20:02.474
Well give me a pen.
Let's get this done!

20:02.560 --> 20:04.001
'Cause like you said,

20:04.042 --> 20:04.942
if the roles
were reversed,

20:04.943 --> 20:06.235
you'd be there for me, right?

20:06.236 --> 20:07.469
Damn right.

20:08.728 --> 20:10.317
Uh, it's just one "t", right?

20:11.980 --> 20:13.274
I knew that!

20:13.425 --> 20:15.251
Oh, Mr. Lister, Sir.

20:15.252 --> 20:17.552
I scarcely know
where to begin.

20:17.815 --> 20:19.344
Calm down, Bud!

20:19.510 --> 20:20.875
Whatever's wrong?

20:20.876 --> 20:23.530
I got the kidney tests
mixed up!

20:23.823 --> 20:25.243
Nooo!!

20:25.456 --> 20:28.627
He got the kidney tests
mixed up!

20:29.152 --> 20:31.041
At first, I thought
it was Mr. Lister

20:31.042 --> 20:32.049
who had no kidneys.

20:32.050 --> 20:33.816
But when I checked
the results again,

20:33.817 --> 20:35.046
I discovered
that it was you

20:35.047 --> 20:36.648
who had no kidneys, Sir.

20:36.649 --> 20:39.306
I'm going to have to
get myself a kidney then.

20:39.316 --> 20:40.720
But where?

20:43.302 --> 20:44.590
But then I thought to myself,

20:44.591 --> 20:46.234
if you have no kidneys,

20:46.252 --> 20:47.891
how come you're not dead?

20:47.900 --> 20:48.742
Yeah.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.980
How come you're not dead?

20:51.741 --> 20:52.927
Why is that?

20:53.048 --> 20:55.617
Well then I went and looked
at the medi-results again,

20:55.618 --> 20:56.682
and blow me!

20:56.825 --> 21:00.443
I discovered I hadn't made
a mistake after all.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.859
I beg your pardon?

21:03.860 --> 21:06.097
Yeah. Mr. Lister
needs new kidneys,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.596
not you, Sir.

21:07.929 --> 21:09.080
I've got the form.

21:09.081 --> 21:10.088
I've got it signed.

21:10.089 --> 21:12.090
Let's get smocked up
and do this.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.220
What's that?!

21:15.221 --> 21:16.625
Pre-op injection, Sir.

21:16.625 --> 21:17.848
It will help you relax.

21:17.849 --> 21:20.034
Oh, I very much doubt that!

21:29.375 --> 21:33.135
Asclepius, are you ready
to rewrite the DNA?

21:33.207 --> 21:34.420
Before we begin,

21:34.421 --> 21:35.851
what do you do when
a bunch of people

21:35.852 --> 21:38.775
think you're some Fancy Dan
DNA medi-computer when,

21:38.801 --> 21:41.847
in fact, that's not
what you do at all?

21:41.857 --> 21:43.183
What do you do?

21:43.318 --> 21:44.816
Look on my back.

21:45.464 --> 21:48.097
"Snacky".
Automated snack dispenser.

21:48.325 --> 21:50.129
For service, please call...

21:50.130 --> 21:53.427
there's a number with a
Milton Keynes dialing code.

22:02.848 --> 22:04.427
So where does
this leave us?

22:04.428 --> 22:06.428
Well, without a
state-of-the-art medi-bot,

22:06.429 --> 22:09.343
we can't rewrite the Cat's DNA
and his kidneys

22:09.344 --> 22:10.890
won't be compatible.

22:10.891 --> 22:12.781
It's like V.H.S.
and Betamax -

22:12.782 --> 22:14.863
or the Catholic church
and science.

22:15.941 --> 22:18.259
Kryten, when we
were on that space station,

22:18.260 --> 22:19.955
we came across
this skeleton, right.

22:19.956 --> 22:22.098
It was weird because
the DNAon the knife

22:22.099 --> 22:23.183
was the same

22:23.184 --> 22:24.579
as the DNA
in the body.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.169
Could this Romero guy

22:26.170 --> 22:28.643
have somehow been
killed by his own clone?

22:28.644 --> 22:30.799
And if so,
can we clone me?

22:30.800 --> 22:32.715
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

22:32.716 --> 22:35.443
but Romero wasn't killed
by his own clone.

22:35.444 --> 22:36.713
Well who killed him, then?

22:36.714 --> 22:39.388
He was a stasis engineer
working on a project

22:39.389 --> 22:40.506
to hack stasis booths

22:40.507 --> 22:42.173
in order to create a portal

22:42.174 --> 22:43.447
back into the past.

22:43.448 --> 22:44.955
He used to talk about it
with his colleagues

22:44.956 --> 22:46.909
when they were
ordering snacks.

22:46.910 --> 22:48.938
One day, his
future self appeared

22:48.939 --> 22:50.719
and told him to
never go back in time,

22:50.720 --> 22:52.601
or he'd be stabbed to death.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.698
The younger Romero refused
to believe him,

22:54.699 --> 22:56.466
and stabbed him to death.

22:56.771 --> 22:58.735
He realized what a terrible
thing he'd done,

22:58.736 --> 23:01.152
so he went back in time
to warn his younger self,

23:01.153 --> 23:03.151
but got stabbed to death.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.222
Could we use his
research somehow?

23:07.223 --> 23:09.243
You mean use
Romero's configuration

23:09.244 --> 23:10.985
to go back in time,

23:10.986 --> 23:13.227
and take the younger
Mr. Lister's kidney's

23:13.228 --> 23:15.047
and insert them
into you, Sir?

23:15.048 --> 23:17.002
But wouldn't his
future self drop dead?

23:17.003 --> 23:19.755
Not if we insert
an MTK chip in him

23:19.756 --> 23:21.687
to keep him going,
until he turns

23:21.688 --> 23:23.014
from younger Mr. Lister

23:23.015 --> 23:24.686
into present-day Mr. Lister!

23:24.687 --> 23:26.554
How can you nick my
internal organs

23:26.555 --> 23:27.823
with me not noticing?

23:27.824 --> 23:28.839
We chloroform you,

23:28.840 --> 23:29.703
swipe your kidneys,

23:29.704 --> 23:31.343
and then you wake up
feeling groggy,

23:31.344 --> 23:32.835
think you must have
got black-out drunk-

23:32.836 --> 23:33.869
which you did!

23:34.098 --> 23:35.247
You know, that's right!

23:35.248 --> 23:36.629
I blacked out,

23:36.639 --> 23:38.343
and then spent
two days in bed

23:38.344 --> 23:39.564
feeling like the living dead.

23:39.565 --> 23:40.891
No offense.

23:41.464 --> 23:43.465
And I couldn't
understand it

23:43.466 --> 23:45.413
'cause I could only remember
having two drinks.

23:45.414 --> 23:47.702
But it wasn't that -
 it was 'cause I had no kidneys,

23:47.703 --> 23:50.592
I only have the MTK
chip keeping me alive!

23:50.664 --> 23:53.052
You know, I believe we
can do this, Sir!

23:53.053 --> 23:53.826
How?

23:53.827 --> 23:56.724
No one knows how to
reconfigure the stasis booths.

23:56.928 --> 23:58.028
What about you?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.873
I'm a snack machine.

24:01.375 --> 24:02.400
Did you overhear Romero

24:02.401 --> 24:04.244
when he was talking
about the adjustments?

24:04.245 --> 24:07.547
But he only ever figured out
how to go back 30 years.

24:07.548 --> 24:10.923
Going back just a few days
needs precision accuracy.

24:10.924 --> 24:12.536
Well, you could build
on his findings.

24:12.537 --> 24:16.218
I'm just a snack dispenser.
I just dispense snacks.

24:16.219 --> 24:17.930
But when we had
our therapy sessions,

24:17.931 --> 24:20.488
you taught me how to find
the hero inside myself.

24:20.489 --> 24:21.659
No, I didn't.

24:21.684 --> 24:22.637
And you know why?

24:22.638 --> 24:25.264
I-I'm just a
snack dispenser.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.094
Yes, you're just
a snack dispenser

24:27.095 --> 24:28.929
if you think you're just
a snack dispenser,

24:28.930 --> 24:30.737
but you're not only
a snack dispenser,

24:30.738 --> 24:31.617
you're something more

24:31.618 --> 24:33.396
if you decide you want
to be something more!

24:33.397 --> 24:35.119
You taught me that
in our first session!

24:35.120 --> 24:37.103
I didn't teach you anything.
You know why?!?

24:37.104 --> 24:38.959
Me, me, me, me!
I got this one!

24:38.960 --> 24:40.413
Is it because you're
a snack dispenser?

24:40.414 --> 24:41.953
I'm a snack dispenser!

24:43.520 --> 24:45.158
Let me ask you
a few questions.

24:45.159 --> 24:48.226
How do you unify
the triode valve?

24:48.227 --> 24:50.257
You reduce the
transmoculiter ??? settings.

24:50.314 --> 24:51.428
Yes!

24:51.429 --> 24:52.431
Did you know that?

24:52.432 --> 24:53.555
No. It's just a long word.

24:53.556 --> 24:55.456
It's good enough for me.

24:55.522 --> 24:58.043
What does
G.F.R. stand for?

24:58.048 --> 25:00.471
Gyrospectic functioning rate.

25:00.527 --> 25:03.159
You're right.
Perhaps I can do this.

25:03.346 --> 25:06.599
Okay.
Get me to the nearest stasis booth.

25:15.249 --> 25:17.626
There.
That should do it.

25:17.735 --> 25:19.714
All right then.
Let's do this!

25:19.715 --> 25:20.811
Oh! Before we do,

25:20.812 --> 25:22.359
can I have a pack
of twirly-whirlers?

25:22.360 --> 25:23.415
Please.

25:23.416 --> 25:25.602
I'm a stasis booth engineer.

25:25.867 --> 25:27.568
You've changed.

25:35.176 --> 25:37.106
It's Sunday!
It worked!

25:39.012 --> 25:40.688
The MTK chip
is expiring, Sir.

25:40.689 --> 25:42.697
We haven't
got much time!

25:58.426 --> 26:00.526
Tough as
old boots.

26:10.843 --> 26:12.063
What now?

26:12.491 --> 26:13.861
We've got to
return that Lister

26:13.862 --> 26:14.967
to the sleeping quarters

26:14.994 --> 26:16.584
and then get this Lister
back to the present.

26:16.585 --> 26:18.210
Where he can recuperate
in the science room

26:18.211 --> 26:20.261
and get back
to full health.

26:20.262 --> 26:20.976
Someone's coming!

26:20.977 --> 26:23.150
It's crucial we're not discovered
by our old selves.

26:23.177 --> 26:26.314
It could discombobulate
the entire space-time continuum!

26:26.314 --> 26:27.829
Quick!
In here!

26:28.872 --> 26:29.966
Where to, Sirs?

26:29.993 --> 26:32.216
The sleeping quarters,
and make it snappy.

26:39.613 --> 26:41.058
Lift coming, Sir.

26:41.553 --> 26:42.604
Come on,
come on!

26:42.630 --> 26:44.682
Why are you
always so slow?!

26:44.712 --> 26:47.374
I've seen snails with clubbed feet
travel faster than you.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.458
The French Army after
lunch move quicker!

26:50.323 --> 26:52.816
Sir, your past self
is calling for the lift.

26:52.843 --> 26:54.913
Don't tell him anything.
You'll blow the time line.

26:54.965 --> 26:56.567
He's getting really angry, Sir.

26:56.619 --> 26:58.031
Ignore him.
He's an idiot.

26:58.292 --> 26:59.158
But he's you!

26:59.347 --> 27:00.480
He's "past" me.

27:00.532 --> 27:02.309
"Present" me is a
whole lot smarter.

27:02.362 --> 27:04.640
I understand now why
you were so slow.

27:04.669 --> 27:07.065
You were transporting us,
but you couldn't tell me.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.927
He's threatening
to fire me, Sir.

27:08.954 --> 27:10.568
How can you fire a lift?

27:10.582 --> 27:12.995
What is wrong with him?
He's a total gimboid.

27:13.262 --> 27:15.644
Look, I'll make it right
when I'm back in the present.

27:15.671 --> 27:17.671
I'll un-fire you.
Promote you, even.

27:17.741 --> 27:19.315
Install you in
that swanky

27:19.342 --> 27:21.179
glass shaft over on the
officer's deck.

27:21.205 --> 27:22.208
How does that sound?

27:22.234 --> 27:24.834
Officer's deck?
That sounds marvelous, Sir!

27:32.580 --> 27:34.410
I'll get the other one!

27:34.841 --> 27:35.686
Lights!

27:42.698 --> 27:43.986
Wait for me!!

27:50.124 --> 27:50.990
A couple of days

27:51.016 --> 27:52.800
recuperating in
the science room, Sir

27:52.801 --> 27:54.013
and you'll be
right as rain.

27:54.014 --> 27:55.145
So I'm going to be okay?

27:55.171 --> 27:56.402
And so will the past you,

27:56.403 --> 27:57.504
whose kidneys you

27:57.505 --> 27:59.177
body-napped
to give to yourself.

27:59.204 --> 28:00.779
Where would
I be without me.

28:00.831 --> 28:02.542
Probably sat here
without any kidneys.

28:02.569 --> 28:04.430
Whereas now, I'm sat there
without any kidneys.

28:04.439 --> 28:05.858
Good 'ol me, eh?

28:17.136 --> 28:19.330
Ah, hello Rimmer.
Remember me?

28:19.357 --> 28:20.595
Of course!

28:20.752 --> 28:23.469
They moved you down to
Shaft 6?

28:23.495 --> 28:25.363
Three weeks I've been
waiting for that promotion

28:25.364 --> 28:26.627
you promised me.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.716
Yeah. That sort of
slipped my mind.

28:28.768 --> 28:29.857
I've got some news.

28:29.884 --> 28:31.913
Snacky's installed a
new killer power reactor

28:31.914 --> 28:32.906
to my counter balance,

28:32.963 --> 28:35.050
which means I can now
travel between floors

28:35.076 --> 28:36.791
at close to the
speed of light.

28:36.818 --> 28:38.315
I haven't tested
it yet, though.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.287
I've been waiting
for you, Rimmer.

28:40.313 --> 28:42.246
Close to the
speed of light?

28:42.293 --> 28:44.607
I'm going to take you
on the ride of your life.

28:44.633 --> 28:45.610
Now hang on!

28:45.662 --> 28:46.610
No.

28:46.689 --> 28:47.847
You hang on.
