<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:28.153
Wow, Dad.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.739
All these boots are about to get a reboot.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.158
They sure are.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.581
What's that?

00:39.665 --> 00:41.166
According to the computer,

00:41.250 --> 00:47.005
it was ordered by one Earl McBride, and it's called a saddle.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.800
Some sort of contraption you put on a horse.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.594
Wonder why you'd put this on a horse.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.429
And what is a horse?

00:54.513 --> 00:57.182
Do you mind giving it a plug, son?

01:00.352 --> 01:02.062
<i>Giddy, giddyap Gotta giddyap</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:04.105
<i>Look, it's a horse They've got strong legs</i>

01:04.188 --> 01:06.191
<i>For riding or hauling And they make great pets</i>

01:06.275 --> 01:08.026
<i>Their manes are long and I would bet</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:10.279
<i>If you give it a brush, they'll neigh Oh, yes</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:11.989
-<i>Neigh</i> -<i>Oh, yes</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.324
-<i>Neigh</i> -<i>Saddle up</i>

01:14.408 --> 01:16.159
<i>Giddy, giddyap, gotta giddyap</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:18.161
<i>Giddy, giddyap, gotta giddyap, up</i>

01:18.245 --> 01:20.080
<i>Giddy, giddyap, gotta giddyap</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:22.207
<i>Clippety-clop, I'm riding on top</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:24.918
<i>Me and my horse gonna giddyap, up</i>

01:27.546 --> 01:30.340
Now we know that horses are large animals

01:30.424 --> 01:33.177
that humans often use for carrying heavy things and riding.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.014
Fascinating data, but I still have a big question.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.183
How do you ride a horse?

01:39.266 --> 01:41.018
Great question, Dad.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.102
I calculate that

01:42.186 --> 01:45.814
the person who ordered this saddle must know a thing or two about riding horses.

01:46.356 --> 01:49.276
I know. Why don't we deliver the saddle ourselves?

01:49.359 --> 01:53.238
Then maybe, we'll discover more data about how to ride horses.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.824
You know my router can't resist a good road trip.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.411
<i>Giddy, giddy beep Giddy, giddy boop</i>

01:59.494 --> 02:00.537
<i>Beep boop</i>

02:00.621 --> 02:02.539
<i>Giddy, giddy beep Giddy, giddy boop</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:04.166
<i>Beep boop</i>

02:04.249 --> 02:06.543
<i>Giddy, giddy beep Giddy, giddy boop, boo--</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:10.506
Hey, what happened to the road?

02:10.589 --> 02:11.757
I'm not sure, Dad.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.262
The robo map indicates we're almost there,

02:17.846 --> 02:19.139
but where do we go now?

02:19.723 --> 02:22.100
Howdy, Doug. Bob Bot!

02:22.184 --> 02:24.520
You bots look a little lost.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.522
Why, greetings, Kath.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.525
We have a saddle delivery for an Earl McBride.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.277
But the road just ended.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.447
Old Earl lives way at the end of that trail.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.657
Up on the hill.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.493
You can't get there in a car, no, sirree.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.120
But you can get there by riding a horse.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.831
Oh, no. We don't have a horse.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.042
Well, don't worry your widgets.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.877
I can take you there on my horses.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.047
That's my ranch right over there.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.550
I'll get you saddled up and riding in no time.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.635
We've never done that before,

02:56.718 --> 02:59.763
but we do have to get this saddle delivered.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.141
And we'd learn how to ride a horse along the way.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.227
Well, come on then.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.895
-Yeehaw! -Yeehaw!

03:09.690 --> 03:10.691
Wow.

03:14.403 --> 03:15.821
Hold up now.

03:15.904 --> 03:20.242
If you wanna be around horses, there are some safety rules you have to follow.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.620
First, you have to say hello to your horse.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.123
Doug, this is Hunky Dory.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.166
He's just the right size for ya.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.587
And Bob Bot, this is Fancy.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.505
She's about tall enough for ya.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.969
Hey! Hi, there.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.138
Hold out your hand for them to smell.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.269
And give 'em a nice, soft pat.

03:51.857 --> 03:55.777
I sense that Hunky Dory and I are gonna get along just fine.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.782
I'm not sure I sense the same thing.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.327
Is there a glitch in my horse's programming?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.829
Fancy can be a bit nervous,

04:05.913 --> 04:09.666
but once she warms up to ya, she's a big old sweetheart.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.585
All righty, riders.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.421
Time to put on helmets so we stay safe out there.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.176
Thanks, boy.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.928
Are we ready to mount up?

04:21.512 --> 04:24.723
My processors are as prepared as they'll ever be.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.398
Is this how you get on?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.237
Maybe this will be more effective.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.864
Come on now, Fancy.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.659
Just stay still!

04:44.576 --> 04:46.328
Let me give you a hand, partner.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.830
I sure hope I get better at this.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.415
It'll happen.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.501
Don't get your gears in a grind.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.545
Time to hit the trail.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.631
Just follow me and old Loosey Goosey, here.

04:59.091 --> 05:02.719
Get along, little bottys. Yeehaw!

05:02.803 --> 05:03.887
Here we go!

05:06.765 --> 05:11.895
Wow. My sensors indicate that riding horses is a great way to explore nature.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.108
And what do you think of the flowers, Fancy?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.031
Hey, where are you going, Hunky?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.868
It looks like he likes apples.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.412
Horses love to eat apples.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.539
Just steer him back to the trail.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.625
And how do we steer?

05:33.709 --> 05:36.503
Pull your reins this way to go this way.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.464
And that way to go that way. Try it.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.426
Pull this way to go this way.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.387
That way to go that way.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.933
And if you need to stop, pull back both of the reins and say, "Whoa."

05:50.684 --> 05:51.894
There we go, Hunky.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.812
Now, whoa.

05:53.896 --> 05:54.897
We did it!

05:55.397 --> 05:58.150
More horseback riding facts for my data banks.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.360
I don't think I'm doing it right.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.072
Pull the reins to the left, Bob Bot.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.741
Kath, I gotta be honest.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.952
I think Fancy's navigation system needs an upgrade.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.370
Little to the right.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.373
Recalculating.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.875
Recalculating.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.753
Recalculating.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.009
Hold your hard drives.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.844
I have an idea.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.977
Much more efficient steering method.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.646
And stopping.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.649
Wow, lickety-split.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.359
There is something I've never seen.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.071
Well, I'm sure glad we figured that out.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.656
Come on now.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.449
Get along, little bottys.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.117
We have a saddle to deliver.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.291
Whoa. Oh, no. I forgot.

06:56.375 --> 07:01.338
To get to Earl's, we have to first go through… Gobble Gulch.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.756
Gobble Gulch?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.258
What's Gobble Gulch?

07:04.341 --> 07:10.472
It's a gulch filled with turkeys who pop out and gobble loudly.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.891
But don't worry.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.061
You just need to stay calm to keep your horses calm

07:16.144 --> 07:17.437
and we'll get through it.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.856
You got it, Kath.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.402
We'll keep it in low gear.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.197
All righty, stay on the lookout.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.867
Those turkeys could be anywhere.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.342
Sorry, girl.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.720
That turkey really scrambled my sensors.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.514
Easy, Hunky.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.474
But remember what Kath said.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.436
We need to stay… calm!

07:57.519 --> 08:00.480
Must keep calm to keep the horse…

08:00.564 --> 08:01.607
calm!

08:06.028 --> 08:10.240
Oh, no. We're supposed to stay right behind Kath, but Dad needs our help.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.408
Come on, Hunky.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.121
Giddyap, Hunky.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.332
Someone stop this horsey!

08:18.415 --> 08:22.044
Dad, if you wanna stop, you and Fancy need to calm down.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.796
How do we do that?

08:25.923 --> 08:27.633
I know what always calms me down.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.092
A song.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.344
Great thinking, son.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.013
Nothing soothes the gears quite like music.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
<i>Neigh</i>

08:35.849 --> 08:38.184
<i>Beep, beep, beep, beep Boop, boop, boop</i>

08:38.268 --> 08:41.270
<i>Neigh</i>

08:41.355 --> 08:45.025
<i>Whoa</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:46.693
Thanks, my bot.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.780
Guess her systems just got a little overstimulated.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.907
That gulch sure can gobble.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.201
Come on, let's get back on the trail.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.460
Uh-oh. You okay, Fancy, girl?

09:03.544 --> 09:04.545
You seem tired.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.592
I bet after all that running, you could use a drink, huh?

09:10.676 --> 09:13.262
Cool down your processors.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.183
There you go.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.395
Good girl.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.900
Okay, what's happening?

09:26.984 --> 09:29.361
Dad! I think Fancy likes you.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.738
Well, how about that?

09:31.822 --> 09:33.407
Attagirl, Fancy.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.411
Kath's probably waiting for us, Dad.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.954
We better get going to Earl's.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.455
Right you are, my bot.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.085
According to my memory banks,

09:45.169 --> 09:48.463
you don't like it when I try to get on board, do you, girl?

09:50.507 --> 09:51.592
What's she doing now?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.802
It seems like she wants you to get on board.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.266
I suppose I could try.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.351
I'll just get on gently.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.312
One leg at a time, eh?

10:03.395 --> 10:06.023
Hey, she wouldn't let me do this before.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.942
Maybe her operating system is warming up to me.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.986
Come on, Fancy, girl.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.196
We're almost there.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.533
There's my trotting bots.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.205
Loosey Goosey and I thought you were right behind us.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.875
Well, bots, this here's Earl McBride.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.293
-Hi, Earl. -Howdy, Earl.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.086
Afternoon, bots.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.255
Look, we brought your saddle.

10:30.339 --> 10:34.134
We wanted to deliver it in person so we can learn how to ride a horse.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.595
You sure as sugar have that figured out.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.848
Looks like you and your horses are getting along just fine.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.184
Well, thank you for noticing, Earl,

10:42.267 --> 10:45.479
and I just realized the answer to my big question.

10:45.562 --> 10:49.525
You ride a horse by staying safe, steering, stopping

10:50.692 --> 10:55.113
and, most importantly, making friends with your horse.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.240
Am I right, son?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.658
You sure are, Dad.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.202
Well, how about that?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.788
Say, do y'all wanna stay and rest up a bit?

11:02.871 --> 11:06.667
Thanks for the offer, Earl, but I have another idea.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.587
I'd like to keep riding Fancy here and polish up my horse-riding skills.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.422
What do ya say, girl?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.550
Wanna practice steering and stopping?

11:15.759 --> 11:16.927
Attagirl.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.138
I reckon we're gonna be great friends.

11:22.558 --> 11:23.809
-Happy trails. -Happy trail.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.603
Meet you back at the ranch, Kath.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.362
-Here you go, Mom. -Thanks, Doug.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.947
And don't worry, Forkrick.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.617
We'll have your loose wheel repaired in a robo-flash.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.160
Okay, here we go--

11:42.744 --> 11:45.497
Well. That was a shock to the circuits.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.499
Let's try again.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.549
I'm sorry, Becky Bot.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.009
It's my protective mode.

11:57.092 --> 12:01.221
Whenever I get a little nervous, it just sort of protects me.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.726
Hey, Emma. What's rebooting?

12:05.809 --> 12:10.189
<i>Doug. I'm in the middle of a pint-sized Pine emergency.</i>

12:10.272 --> 12:12.274
<i>Can you come over and help, please?</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:16.195
I would, Emma, but I'm kind of helping my mom fix Uncle Forkrick.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.198
Here I go again.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.950
Go on to Emma, sweetie.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.911
I think this might take a while.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.954
Thanks, Mom. Emma, I'm on my way.

12:27.414 --> 12:31.084
-No. No! -No dentist, please.

12:32.836 --> 12:36.048
Emma, looks like your little sisters are in overdrive.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.800
That's why I called you, my best buddy bot.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.887
Because I could really use some--

12:43.138 --> 12:45.390
You're wondering why I'm dressed like a tooth.

12:45.474 --> 12:46.808
Maybe a little.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.978
The twins have their first dentist appointment today,

12:50.771 --> 12:52.147
and they're really nervous.

12:52.231 --> 12:57.152
So, I'm trying to show them there's nothing to be nervous about.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.487
It's what big sisters do.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.114
Wait a nanosecond, what's a dentist?

13:01.198 --> 13:02.991
Better plug in to find out.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.996
<i>Smile big, open wide</i>

13:08.080 --> 13:10.666
<i>Let's check out your pearly whites</i>

13:10.749 --> 13:13.460
<i>There's baby teeth, big teeth And pointy ones too</i>

13:13.544 --> 13:16.213
<i>We scrub 'em at home Till they shine like new</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:19.883
<i>And every now and then We check in with the dentist</i>

13:19.967 --> 13:21.635
<i>The tooth doctor</i>

13:21.718 --> 13:24.054
<i>Cleaning teeth from top to bottom</i>

13:24.137 --> 13:26.640
<i>We brush 'em and floss 'em And brush 'em and floss 'em</i>

13:26.723 --> 13:28.851
<i>Cavity? Not a problem</i>

13:28.934 --> 13:31.645
<i>It's the dentist The tooth doctor</i>

13:31.728 --> 13:33.355
-<i>Shout teeth</i> -Teeth!

13:33.438 --> 13:34.940
-<i>If you got 'em</i> -Hey!

13:35.023 --> 13:37.568
<i>We brush 'em and floss 'em And brush 'em and floss 'em</i>

13:37.651 --> 13:40.195
<i>Minty fresh Your breath is awesome</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:43.323
I see.

13:43.407 --> 13:46.785
A dentist is a doctor who helps keep your teeth clean and healthy.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.412
That sounds really important.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.164
Only I still have a big question.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.668
If the twins are nervous, how do we get them to go to the dentist?

13:54.751 --> 13:58.714
Well, I thought if I showed the twins how much teeth loved dentists,

13:58.797 --> 14:00.340
they'd love dentists too.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.177
That's why I'm playing a tooth.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.803
Hey, girls.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.638
Look at me.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.892
I'm a tooth, and I love to be brush, brush, brushed.

14:09.975 --> 14:13.645
Oh, yeah. Feel that fluoride.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.649
And teeth love to be flossed.

14:17.733 --> 14:21.445
-I wanna help. They're so silly. -Flossy, flossy, flossy, flossy.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.239
It's working, Emma. They don't seem nervous anymore.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.284
Oh, no. What's this?

14:27.367 --> 14:31.330
A dirty spot I cannot brush out?

14:31.413 --> 14:34.833
There's only one person who can clean this.

14:34.917 --> 14:38.462
The super awesome and friendly dentist.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.672
But I wanna stay and play with Tooth Emma.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.925
Floss Emma! Floss Emma!

14:43.008 --> 14:46.970
Oh, no. We've gotta get them into the dentist's chair somehow.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.264
All right, girls. It's time for our appointment.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.641
Ready to go to the…

14:51.517 --> 14:52.726
dentist?

14:52.809 --> 14:56.897
-No, stay here. Hide! -You can't find me.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.482
It's okay, Emma.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.110
I'll catch 'em with my robo-skates.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.029
Ready or not, here I come.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.284
Skating! Hide!

15:10.994 --> 15:12.246
That's it!

15:12.329 --> 15:17.125
I know a super fun game we can play on the way to the dentist's office.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.669
Excellent idea.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.003
We'll play a game.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.089
-A game? -A game?

15:22.172 --> 15:25.467
It's a little something I like to call,

15:25.551 --> 15:28.846
"Follow the robot to the dentist's office."

15:28.929 --> 15:31.265
The dentist's office is just down that street.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.767
Lead the way, my shiny friend.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.311
Okay. Follow me.

15:37.938 --> 15:38.981
Oops.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.360
Forgot humans don't have jet packs.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.489
Nope. We'll have to get there the old-fashioned walkie way.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.657
Follow that robot.

16:08.427 --> 16:12.306
Coming in for a landing at the dentist's office.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.892
-Fun, fun, fun. -I like following robots.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.894
Great thinking with the game, Emma Bean.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.313
No biggie, Dad.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.440
It's what we big sisters do.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.906
Wow. So this is a dentist's office?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.283
Dentists sure do play with a lot of toys.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.953
Doug, this is the waiting room.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.580
The toys are for us kids.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.582
And grown-ups too.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.584
Hey, Laurence. Wanna blast off?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.462
To the moon.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.423
Tabatha Pine? Agatha Pine?

16:46.507 --> 16:48.592
The dentist is ready to see you.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.968
Dentist?

16:52.596 --> 16:53.847
Where'd the twins go?

16:54.389 --> 16:56.391
Uh-oh, I'm not sure.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.018
They just disappeared.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.312
This is real big sister stuff.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.730
We gotta find 'em.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.415
Tabatha? Agatha?

17:22.084 --> 17:24.252
What is it, Doug? Did you find my sisters?

17:24.336 --> 17:26.128
No, but I found something else.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.800
Wow.

17:29.883 --> 17:33.136
-What is this? -Hi, kids.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.390
Come on in. This is our X-ray machine.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.474
A machine?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.894
And a robo-hello to you, my good bot.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.354
What's your primary function?

17:42.437 --> 17:44.064
This X-ray takes pictures

17:44.147 --> 17:47.317
that show a dentist everything going on inside your mouth.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.486
Even things you can't see with your eyes.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.739
-Things you… -Can't see?

17:52.823 --> 17:54.241
An X-ray machine?

17:55.951 --> 17:58.412
Wouldn't you love to see how that thing works?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.122
Keep asking questions, Doug.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.708
-The twins look interested. -Could I try it?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.752
Gotta admit, I'd kind of like to see that.

18:05.836 --> 18:06.837
Way ahead of ya.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.517
Check out my robo-teeth.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.312
I've never seen the inside of my mouth before.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.023
It's un-bot-lievable.

18:26.815 --> 18:27.983
And what's that?

18:28.066 --> 18:32.029
Such a strange piece of furniture. Is it a chair?

18:32.112 --> 18:34.031
It's the dentist chair, Doug.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.241
Check it out, you two.

18:36.325 --> 18:39.703
It's the most incredible chair you could ever dream of sitting on.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.916
It's like lying down but also sitting at the same time.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.876
It's got more gadgets than me!

18:45.959 --> 18:48.670
More gadgets than Doug?

18:48.754 --> 18:51.507
Is that my favorite family I hear?

18:51.590 --> 18:53.800
Hello there, Pines.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.386
-Dr. T! -Emma!

18:57.346 --> 18:58.931
I've got toothbrushes.

19:00.057 --> 19:02.017
There's one more behind your ear.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.812
Great to see you too, Laurence. I hope you've been flossing.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.565
Twice a day. And three times on Sundays.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.528
Okay, okay. Looking good. Looking good.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.446
And who have we here?

19:14.530 --> 19:17.241
Dr. T, meet my best bot, Doug.

19:17.324 --> 19:21.161
Doug, meet Dr. Taflingarino.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.579
I'm the dentist.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.665
She's the dentist?

19:24.748 --> 19:27.709
I'm glad to meet you, because I have so many questions.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.711
Like, what does this do? And this?

19:30.504 --> 19:32.548
Look at this. And--

19:32.631 --> 19:33.924
Circuit overload.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.717
Oh, my goodness.

19:35.801 --> 19:39.304
I've never seen anyone so curious about dentistry.

19:39.388 --> 19:44.351
All right, come on. Hop in the chair, and I'll show you what we dentists do.

19:47.104 --> 19:49.231
First, let's get you comfortable.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.691
See, look.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.235
The chair moves all the way back.

19:53.318 --> 19:58.240
And using this special light, I can get a good look at your mouth

19:58.323 --> 20:01.952
then check out your teeth using this little mirror here.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.705
And use these little tools to clean them.

20:04.788 --> 20:08.458
There's even a little gizmo to polish your teeth so they're nice and shiny.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.460
That one kind of tickles.

20:10.544 --> 20:15.132
And I can even get you a glass of water with this little sink here.

20:17.301 --> 20:20.512
Dr. T, can you sing the "I'm cleaning your teeth" song?

20:20.596 --> 20:24.224
-The twins love songs. -Song. Song. Song. Song.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.143
Please do grace us with a song.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.062
All right, here we go!

20:29.146 --> 20:31.940
<i>First a squeeze Then a rub, rub, rub</i>

20:32.024 --> 20:34.693
<i>Keep them clean With a scrub, scrub, scrub</i>

20:34.776 --> 20:37.279
<i>Get the front ones Then the back</i>

20:37.362 --> 20:39.823
<i>Fluoride helps prevent plaque</i>

20:39.907 --> 20:40.908
My turn!

20:40.991 --> 20:44.453
-I go in chair. Me, please. -Then me, please. I'm next.

20:44.536 --> 20:45.913
Dentist. Dentist.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.122
Emma, look.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.416
Your sisters wanna have their teeth examined.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.502
They sure do, Doug. They're--

20:51.585 --> 20:53.253
I can't believe it.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.672
They're definitely not nervous anymore.

20:55.756 --> 20:59.134
You did it, Emma Bean. Way to be a big sister.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.845
And way to be a big help, Doug.

21:01.929 --> 21:04.932
Yeah! And I learned the answer to my question.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.642
To get the twins to the dentist,

21:06.725 --> 21:09.269
we show them how a dentist takes care of your teeth.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.604
It's true, Doug.

21:10.687 --> 21:14.525
If we know how something works, we're usually not so nervous about it anymore.

21:15.734 --> 21:16.735
Nervous?

21:16.818 --> 21:19.238
That gives me an idea for helping Uncle Forkrick!

21:19.947 --> 21:21.573
Hang on there, Doug.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.575
Don't forget your toothbrush.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.044
I'm sorry, Becky Bot.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.338
I just can't deactivate my protective mode.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.800
Uncle Forkrick! Mom! I think I know a way to help.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.387
Emma's sisters were really nervous to go to the dentist today.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.099
But when they saw what a dentist does, they weren't nervous anymore.

21:47.182 --> 21:51.645
Maybe if you see how Mom fixes a wheel, you won't be nervous anymore either.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.939
And we can finally get you all fixed up.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.400
Let's give it a try, nephew bot.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.444
-And maybe try a little song? -Okay.

21:59.528 --> 22:02.322
<i>Grab a wrench Tighten this piece</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:05.200
<i>A little turn And then some grease</i>

22:05.284 --> 22:06.410
Good as new.

22:08.829 --> 22:10.247
I see now.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.707
Ready to try again?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.836
<i>Grab a wrench Tighten this wheel</i>

22:15.919 --> 22:18.672
<i>Good as new Now you should feel</i>

22:19.214 --> 22:20.215
There.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.926
My protective mode didn't kick in.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.678
No more wobbling.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.013
Thanks, bots!

22:27.556 --> 22:28.557
Wait.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.019
Just in case, don't forget the wrench.

22:34.188 --> 22:35.272
Tickle.

22:35.856 --> 22:38.817
<i>It's the dentist The tooth doctor</i>

22:38.901 --> 22:41.278
<i>Cleaning teeth from top to bottom</i>

22:41.361 --> 22:44.031
<i>We brush 'em and floss 'em And brush 'em and floss 'em</i>

22:44.114 --> 22:46.575
<i>Cavity? Not a problem</i>

22:46.658 --> 22:49.286
<i>It's the dentist The tooth doctor</i>

22:49.369 --> 22:50.746
-<i>Shout teeth</i> -Teeth!

22:50.829 --> 22:52.247
-<i>If you got 'em</i> -Hey!

22:52.331 --> 22:54.958

23:00.380 --> 23:01.590

-<i>If you got 'em</i> -Hey!
